WEBVTT

00:04.965 --> 00:08.679
( music playing )

00:09.930 --> 00:12.933
Easy, easy, easy.

00:12.933 --> 00:15.306
You know, this would
be a lot easier

00:15.306 --> 00:16.687
without you saying "easy"

00:16.687 --> 00:18.689
every two seconds.

00:18.689 --> 00:20.771
Sorry. Careful,

00:20.771 --> 00:22.523
careful, careful.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.405
Uh-oh. Did Leo blow chunks

00:24.405 --> 00:25.646
on the hydra-loop again?

00:25.646 --> 00:27.778
No. We were on a mission

00:27.778 --> 00:29.280
and I hurt my ankle.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.361
And then he blew chunks

00:30.361 --> 00:32.703
on the hydra-loop again.

00:32.703 --> 00:34.034
You know the drill, Bob.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.657
Puke patrol.
I'll grab the mop.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.960
I've taught him well.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.622
We were evacuating
a steel mill

00:41.622 --> 00:43.254
when the roof collapsed.

00:43.254 --> 00:44.875
We were pinned down
and Leo had to jump over

00:44.875 --> 00:46.547
an industrial grinder
to save us.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.129
Come on, buddy.

00:48.129 --> 00:49.260
Let's get you
to the infirmary

00:49.260 --> 00:50.761
and get that leg
checked out.

00:50.761 --> 00:52.553
Would you quit fussing?

00:52.553 --> 00:53.884
I'm a grown man.

00:53.884 --> 00:56.387
I don't need you to baby me.

00:56.387 --> 00:58.139
Mommy!

00:58.139 --> 01:01.182
Oh, I came as soon
as you texted me.

01:01.182 --> 01:02.643
I'm not gonna lie.

01:02.643 --> 01:04.775
This is a grade-A booboo.

01:04.775 --> 01:07.148
We better get you
to your room.

01:07.148 --> 01:08.819
Where is your room?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.781
Oh, the other side
of the island.

01:10.781 --> 01:13.574
Still can't believe you guys
got your own island.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.825
For Valentine's Day,

01:14.825 --> 01:16.537
all I got was
a lousy t-shirt

01:16.537 --> 01:19.830
that said,
"I Married Donald."

01:19.830 --> 01:21.752
Wait, you guys are married?

01:21.752 --> 01:24.915
I just thought
you came over a lot.

01:24.915 --> 01:28.048
MAN: The world's first
bionic super humans.

01:28.048 --> 01:29.840
They're stronger than us,

01:29.840 --> 01:32.763
faster, smarter.

01:32.763 --> 01:35.346
The next generation
of the human race is...

01:35.346 --> 01:37.718
Living on a bionic island.

01:41.061 --> 01:44.775
( theme song playing )

02:11.712 --> 02:14.845
( theme song playing )

02:14.845 --> 02:16.257
Thanks, Mom.
You always make

02:16.257 --> 02:17.678
the best smoothies.

02:17.678 --> 02:19.310
But something's missing.

02:19.310 --> 02:22.313
Here you go.

02:22.313 --> 02:25.436
Perfect. You know, the umbrella
shouldn't affect the taste,

02:25.436 --> 02:28.068
but it just does.

02:28.068 --> 02:30.481
I'm gonna go check
on the pool temperature.

02:30.481 --> 02:32.823
I warmed it up so you
could soak your ankle.

02:32.823 --> 02:35.115
You know, if you wanna throw
a few bubbles in there,

02:35.115 --> 02:37.828
I would not be opposed.

02:39.830 --> 02:40.831
Mom...

02:40.831 --> 02:43.834
you forgot my tuck-tuck.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.086
There you go...

02:46.086 --> 02:47.458
sweetie.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.550
Now, I will be right there

02:49.550 --> 02:51.712
if you need me.

02:51.712 --> 02:53.424
Tuck-tuck?

02:53.424 --> 02:55.055
Kind of milking it,
aren't you?

02:55.055 --> 02:56.847
Oh, not yet. The milk comes

02:56.847 --> 02:59.430
with the cookies at 3:00.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.302
I'm just glad you're
doing better, Leo.

03:01.302 --> 03:02.933
Yeah. You're lucky you
didn't get hurt worse.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.565
You were this close
to being chewed up

03:04.565 --> 03:06.307
by that industrial grinder.

03:06.307 --> 03:08.649
Industrial grinder?

03:08.649 --> 03:10.771
Leo, you told me
you twisted your ankle

03:10.771 --> 03:12.403
jumping for joy.

03:12.403 --> 03:14.365
He was jumping for joy

03:14.365 --> 03:16.697
because he wasn't killed
by an industrial grinder.

03:18.279 --> 03:20.701
Leo almost got ripped apart
by that thing.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.874
What? Ripped apart?

03:23.874 --> 03:24.955
Oh, that's right.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.749
He almost got decapitated too.

03:28.749 --> 03:30.541
Excuse me?

03:30.541 --> 03:33.003
Leo, why didn't you
stay in the van?

03:33.003 --> 03:34.795
What van?

03:34.795 --> 03:37.177
The one you take
on all your missions

03:37.177 --> 03:39.800
when you're out solving
all your mysteries.

03:41.432 --> 03:42.973
Yeah. Why super speed

03:42.973 --> 03:44.805
when I can just throw
on a trucker hat

03:44.805 --> 03:47.438
and be a van-driving mama.

03:47.438 --> 03:49.149
I just always thought
that you guys

03:49.149 --> 03:50.311
did the dangerous stuff

03:50.311 --> 03:51.692
while Leo was in the van,

03:51.692 --> 03:52.983
saying stuff like,

03:52.983 --> 03:54.855
"check" and "all clear."

03:54.855 --> 03:57.778
Check that, Mom.

03:57.778 --> 04:00.281
No, no. Leo does all
the dangerous stuff with us.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.202
This one time, he was
dangling from a helicopter

04:02.202 --> 04:03.494
on top of a skyscraper.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.577
It was super dangerous.

04:06.577 --> 04:08.289
Oh, that's right.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.502
He almost got decapitated
that time too.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.833
It's only a matter of time

04:12.833 --> 04:15.466
before this thing
just pops right off.

04:17.838 --> 04:19.300
( music playing )

04:19.300 --> 04:20.880
Ahoy, matey!

04:20.880 --> 04:22.262
Check out all this cool stuff

04:22.262 --> 04:24.435
that washed up on shore.

04:24.435 --> 04:27.388
Let's see. A tire,
20 pounds of seaweed

04:27.388 --> 04:29.770
and a broken toilet seat.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.813
Bob, that's just a bunch
of useless junk.

04:32.813 --> 04:34.815
I'm gonna give
this stuff to Bree

04:34.815 --> 04:37.067
as a token of my
undying love.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.280
Oh. Well, in that case,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.663
it's perfect.

04:42.663 --> 04:44.034
Whoa, slow down.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.456
Where's the fire?

04:45.456 --> 04:47.578
Oh, it's right here.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.960
Because you're the hottest
thing I've ever seen.

04:51.412 --> 04:52.713
What's up, Bob?

04:52.713 --> 04:54.875
Oh, this is for you.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.467
It's a seaweed necklace.

04:56.467 --> 04:57.588
Yeah.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.800
I'm gonna pass.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.222
I wrestled a manatee for this.

05:06.637 --> 05:09.309
Hi, everyone. I'm here.

05:10.691 --> 05:13.814
Caitlin?
 This place is beautiful.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.105
Thanks for inviting me.

05:15.105 --> 05:17.778
We didn't invite you.

05:17.778 --> 05:19.780
It was implied, Bree.

05:21.031 --> 05:22.783
I had no idea
where you guys went

05:22.783 --> 05:24.365
after you left Mission Creek.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.287
That was the plan.

05:27.287 --> 05:30.120
So I've been secretly
trailing Leo's mom for weeks,

05:30.120 --> 05:32.042
hoping she would
lead me to you guys.

05:32.042 --> 05:33.954
Wait. You've been
stalking Tasha?

05:33.954 --> 05:35.836
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.088
Is it stalking
to follow someone around,

05:38.088 --> 05:40.090
day and night?

05:41.382 --> 05:43.804
Yes.

05:43.804 --> 05:47.307
Fine. I've been
stalking Tasha.

05:47.307 --> 05:49.390
Wait a minute.
How did you get past

05:49.390 --> 05:50.891
our hydra-loop
security guard?

05:50.891 --> 05:52.473
Let's just say

05:52.473 --> 05:54.314
you're gonna need a new one.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.398
Oh, Caitlin,

05:57.398 --> 05:59.780
I'm afraid I have to cut
this reunion short.

05:59.780 --> 06:02.152
No outside visitors
allowed on the island.

06:02.152 --> 06:04.034
Ugh, still that guy,

06:04.034 --> 06:06.537
huh, Chase?

06:06.537 --> 06:07.988
Your sister
wants me to stay,

06:07.988 --> 06:09.990
right?

06:11.161 --> 06:13.203
You know what, sure.

06:13.203 --> 06:14.455
Really?

06:14.455 --> 06:16.256
Good answer, Bree.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.420
What are you doing?

06:19.420 --> 06:20.671
You can't stand her.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.382
That was back
in high school.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.004
I have matured.

06:24.004 --> 06:26.637
I am a mentor now.
I have changed.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.559
Yeah, but she hasn't.

06:28.559 --> 06:29.640
I know we've had

06:29.640 --> 06:31.642
our petty squabbles
in the past,

06:31.642 --> 06:33.273
but we're beyond that.

06:33.273 --> 06:34.775
Plus, it'll be nice
to have a girlfriend

06:34.775 --> 06:36.226
to hang out with
for a couple of days.

06:36.226 --> 06:38.228
Couple weeks, Bree.

06:38.228 --> 06:40.190
Hmm. Good to see you too,

06:40.190 --> 06:42.983
old friend.

06:42.983 --> 06:45.986
( music playing )

06:48.909 --> 06:50.621
How are you feeling today,
honey?

06:50.621 --> 06:53.534
Oh, I'm good. Thanks.

06:53.534 --> 06:54.915
I'm okay but just to be sure,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.246
you should probably whip up

06:56.246 --> 06:57.708
some more of your
oatmeal cookies.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.250
And don't be shy
with the raisins.

07:00.250 --> 07:03.213
Coming right up.

07:03.213 --> 07:05.466
Uh, I'll take
a ham sandwich.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.808
Are you injured?

07:09.009 --> 07:10.851
Ugh, my knee.

07:12.352 --> 07:14.725
I'll take mustard on that.

07:17.017 --> 07:20.270
( music playing )

07:20.270 --> 07:22.653
( indistinct chatter )

07:24.324 --> 07:25.986
What's up, Caitlin?

07:25.986 --> 07:28.529
Still wearin' your hair
like that, huh?

07:30.070 --> 07:32.623
What's wrong with my hair?

07:32.623 --> 07:34.074
Nothing. Looks great,

07:34.074 --> 07:36.707
as long as you're not
leaving the island.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.291
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

07:41.291 --> 07:44.084
Stud muffin.

07:44.084 --> 07:46.006
Ugh, here comes Bob.

07:46.006 --> 07:48.348
Who's Bob?
 He's just this little kid

07:48.348 --> 07:50.140
who's crushing on me.
Just to warn you, it can get

07:50.140 --> 07:51.802
super awkward.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.724
Hey, pretty lady.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.646
Hey, Bob.

07:55.646 --> 07:57.518
Hi. I'm Caitlin,

07:57.518 --> 08:00.731
the girl Bree models
her entire life after.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.734
( romantic music playing )

08:10.781 --> 08:13.323
Bob?

08:13.323 --> 08:15.115
Why are you levitating?

08:15.115 --> 08:17.788
It's like I'm looking
at an angel.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.381
Bob?

08:21.381 --> 08:23.794
Bob?

08:23.794 --> 08:24.795
Bob!

08:24.795 --> 08:28.128
( thuds )

08:28.128 --> 08:29.840
Oh, he's cute.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.842
You think I'm cute?

08:31.842 --> 08:33.933
She thinks I'm cute!
She thinks I'm cute!

08:33.933 --> 08:36.557
She thinks I'm cute!

08:37.847 --> 08:38.808
Yeah, Bree.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.400
He's real into you.

08:42.903 --> 08:44.985
( music playing )

08:44.985 --> 08:46.987
Here you go, Leo.

08:48.068 --> 08:50.070
Any ETA on that sandwich

08:50.070 --> 08:52.072
I ordered half an hour ago?

08:53.704 --> 08:55.616
Trust me. You don't
want me making something

08:55.616 --> 08:56.867
for you right now.

08:56.867 --> 08:59.580
( alarm beeping )

09:00.581 --> 09:01.872
It's a mission alert.

09:01.872 --> 09:04.795
Come on, guys.
We gotta go.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.796
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.258
You can walk?

09:08.258 --> 09:10.801
It must have been
that smoothie.

09:13.013 --> 09:14.635
Okay. You got me.
It's been fun,

09:14.635 --> 09:16.306
but our little charade is over.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.517
Although I will be
home soon, so you might

09:17.517 --> 09:19.810
wanna get cracking
on dinner.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.181
Where do you think
you're going?

09:21.181 --> 09:23.483
There's a mission.
 Uh-uh. No way.

09:23.483 --> 09:25.025
Just because you're up
walking around

09:25.025 --> 09:27.397
doesn't mean that
your ankle is 100%.

09:28.649 --> 09:30.861
Leo, are you coming?

09:30.861 --> 09:32.783
Mom, can we talk about
this later? I need to change.

09:32.783 --> 09:34.194
No. You are not

09:34.194 --> 09:35.866
going anywhere.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.618
But they need me.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.621
I said no.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.163
Now, I'm gonna go layout
your outfit for tomorrow.

09:43.163 --> 09:44.294
Blue or green undies?

09:44.294 --> 09:46.877
Mom!

09:46.877 --> 09:48.258
Green.

09:51.171 --> 09:52.592
Come on, Adam,
we have to go.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.176
Wait.

09:56.176 --> 09:58.719
I'm coming with you.

10:02.312 --> 10:04.775
Yeah.

10:04.775 --> 10:07.778
( music playing )

10:09.229 --> 10:11.611
Oh.
 Wow, Leo.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.073
What are the chances
you would get hurt

10:13.073 --> 10:14.614
twice in a week?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.366
Actually, I could
calculate them for you

10:16.366 --> 10:17.617
if you'd like.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.620
You okay? You hit
your head pretty hard.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.793
Yeah, I'm all right.
I just wanna get upstairs

10:22.793 --> 10:24.795
before my mom finds out.

10:24.795 --> 10:27.167
I'll just tell her
that I have a nasty pimple.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.049
Good idea.
 Thanks, Mom.

10:29.049 --> 10:31.511
Mom!

10:31.511 --> 10:33.093
You deliberately
disobeyed me

10:33.093 --> 10:34.424
and went on that mission.

10:34.424 --> 10:36.596
Mom, I had to go
on this mission.

10:36.596 --> 10:38.058
Look, I'm sorry
I disobeyed you.

10:38.058 --> 10:40.640
It won't happen again.
 Oh, I know it won't,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.522
because you're off
the team.

10:42.522 --> 10:44.394
What?

10:44.394 --> 10:45.645
You might have to talk
a little slower.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.728
He's lost a lot of blood.

10:47.728 --> 10:49.399
( music playing )

10:52.652 --> 10:53.774
( music playing )

10:53.774 --> 10:55.405
What do you mean
I'm off the team?

10:55.405 --> 10:57.197
These guys depend on me
to have their backs,

10:57.197 --> 10:58.618
right, guys?

10:58.618 --> 11:00.951
That's why
we send you in first.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.373
That's not why
we send him in first.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.666
What am I supposed to do
with my bionic arm

11:06.666 --> 11:08.248
if I can't go
on missions?

11:08.248 --> 11:09.960
Tons of stuff.
You could change

11:09.960 --> 11:11.381
light bulbs superfast

11:11.381 --> 11:12.672
or pull weeds
out of the yard.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.055
Ooh, you could
crack walnuts.

11:15.055 --> 11:18.058
The world needs more people
who can do that.

11:19.509 --> 11:21.762
Mom, please.
I'm begging you.

11:21.762 --> 11:23.724
I'm sorry, Leo.
I specifically told you

11:23.724 --> 11:25.976
not to go on that mission
and you went anyway.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.568
You got hurt again,
which just proves my point.

11:28.568 --> 11:31.481
It's too dangerous for you.

11:31.481 --> 11:33.313
You know,
she may be onto something.

11:33.313 --> 11:34.945
You did get hurt
twice in a week.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.526
According to my calculations,

11:36.526 --> 11:38.238
you're on borrowed time.

11:40.530 --> 11:43.533
Uh, I mean, he'll be fine.

11:43.533 --> 11:46.246
We'll get him a helmet.

11:46.246 --> 11:47.627
Now that I actually know

11:47.627 --> 11:49.249
what you do on these missions,

11:49.249 --> 11:51.251
I'm telling Donald you're done.

11:51.251 --> 11:54.094
No. But--all right,

11:54.094 --> 11:56.596
fine. I won't go.

11:56.596 --> 11:59.049
Let's just enjoy these last
few precious moments together

11:59.049 --> 12:01.551
before you go home
and I don't see you again

12:01.551 --> 12:02.722
until...

12:02.722 --> 12:04.805
who knows when.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.267
Nice try.

12:07.267 --> 12:08.558
You actually think
I'm gonna leave you here,

12:08.558 --> 12:10.650
so you can just sneak off again?

12:10.650 --> 12:13.153
You're moving home with me.

12:13.153 --> 12:14.354
What?

12:14.354 --> 12:16.356
You can't do that.

12:16.356 --> 12:18.779
Who's gonna crack
our walnuts?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.032
( music playing )

12:22.032 --> 12:23.784
Oh, man.
 I mean, isn't that the greatest

12:23.784 --> 12:26.416
when she's just like that?

12:26.416 --> 12:28.328
What's so funny?

12:28.328 --> 12:29.920
Caitlin was telling me
this funny story

12:29.920 --> 12:31.581
about what
a weirdo you were

12:31.581 --> 12:32.923
in high school.

12:32.923 --> 12:34.925
I was not a weirdo

12:34.925 --> 12:36.426
in high school.

12:36.426 --> 12:39.339
Calm down.
We're just joking, Bree.

12:39.339 --> 12:41.551
Yeah, Bree.

12:42.642 --> 12:45.555
Did he just
"Yeah, Bree" me?

12:45.555 --> 12:48.348
He totally did.

12:49.689 --> 12:50.981
Caitlin, I've been meaning

12:50.981 --> 12:53.603
to give you something.

12:53.603 --> 12:55.485
It's from the depths
of my soul

12:55.485 --> 12:57.357
and the ocean.

12:57.357 --> 13:00.360
Oh, that smells
like dead fish,

13:00.360 --> 13:02.782
my favorite.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.246
Pretty. Come on, Bob,

13:06.246 --> 13:07.497
let's go talk about Bree

13:07.497 --> 13:09.870
in the other room.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.712
Caitlin, why are you
doing this?

13:12.712 --> 13:14.794
Face it. Bob likes me
better than you.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.876
He's not the first guy

13:15.876 --> 13:18.418
and he won't be the last.

13:18.418 --> 13:19.920
And FYI, your jealousy

13:19.920 --> 13:22.632
only adds to your
unattractiveness.

13:24.684 --> 13:26.056
Can you believe her,

13:26.056 --> 13:28.558
trying to take Bob away
from me like that?

13:28.558 --> 13:31.561
That was my seaweed necklace.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.234
What happened to mature
responsible Bree

13:34.234 --> 13:36.776
who doesn't get roped
into petty squabbles?

13:36.776 --> 13:38.398
This isn't petty.

13:38.398 --> 13:40.030
I just can't let her
get the boy

13:40.030 --> 13:42.652
I don't really want. Hmm.

13:43.613 --> 13:46.616
( music playing )

13:48.118 --> 13:49.619
Hey, Leo, what are you doing?

13:49.619 --> 13:50.871
Oh, nothing.
Just hanging out,

13:50.871 --> 13:52.502
setting a lethal trap
for my mom.

13:53.663 --> 13:56.296
Whoa!

13:59.049 --> 14:00.260
Wait, you're gonna
crush your mom

14:00.260 --> 14:02.132
with a giant metal ball?

14:02.132 --> 14:04.344
Of course not.
I'm gonna impress her

14:04.344 --> 14:06.766
by saving her before
she gets crushed.

14:06.766 --> 14:08.348
Oh.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.350
I'm gonna tell her
it's a training exercise.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.932
Then I'm gonna hit
this button,

14:11.932 --> 14:13.433
say the ball is swinging
out of control,

14:13.433 --> 14:14.935
and before it hits her,

14:14.935 --> 14:16.736
I'm gonna destroy it
with my laser sphere.

14:16.736 --> 14:18.108
Sounds like
a solid plan to me.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.479
What's the worst
that can happen?

14:19.479 --> 14:20.860
I'm a split second too late,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.943
my mom gets crushed to death.

14:22.943 --> 14:25.365
Rock solid.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.287
Hey, Leo,
you should start packing.

14:27.287 --> 14:28.748
We leave first thing
in the morning.

14:28.748 --> 14:30.580
Okay. But can I at least
show you a few things

14:30.580 --> 14:32.122
I learned here
at the academy?

14:32.122 --> 14:33.873
Leo, I don't have time.
I still have to get everything

14:33.873 --> 14:36.206
ready for tomorrow.
 Oh, come on.

14:36.206 --> 14:37.757
It's just a simple
training exercise.

14:37.757 --> 14:39.299
Please?

14:39.299 --> 14:41.001
Fine. But I'm not

14:41.001 --> 14:42.762
changing my mind.

14:42.762 --> 14:43.843
Great.

14:43.843 --> 14:45.885
Stand right...

14:45.885 --> 14:47.387
here.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.719
Leo, where's
the best place to stand

14:49.719 --> 14:51.511
to see your mom
get hit?

14:51.511 --> 14:52.772
What?

14:52.772 --> 14:54.564
I mean not get hit.

14:54.564 --> 14:56.356
Don't worry,
he's gonna rescue you.

14:56.356 --> 14:58.318
He's only doing it to prove
that he's capable enough

14:58.318 --> 15:00.570
to go on missions.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.822
What is with you
and the decapitate--

15:02.822 --> 15:05.615
Oh. You mean cut it out.

15:05.615 --> 15:07.027
Now I get it.

15:07.027 --> 15:08.738
Never mind.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.583
So, you were gonna
try to hit me?

15:13.583 --> 15:15.956
No.
 Let me see that thing.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.588
Mom, wait!

15:20.040 --> 15:22.422
Oh, that was supposed
to be you.

15:24.384 --> 15:25.966
( music playing )

15:25.966 --> 15:27.847
Hey, Bob. Look,

15:27.847 --> 15:29.809
last night's storm washed up
a bunch of cool things.

15:29.809 --> 15:32.392
Hmm. This is for you.

15:33.643 --> 15:35.855
Huh!

15:35.855 --> 15:38.478
Cool! A sea turtle shell.

15:38.478 --> 15:39.609
I'm gonna tape it to my back

15:39.609 --> 15:42.322
and wear it forever.

15:42.322 --> 15:43.443
Nice.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.615
I knew you'd love it.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.777
You two have a lot in common.

15:47.777 --> 15:50.030
Yeah. We do.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.572
I was talking about you
and the turtle.

15:52.572 --> 15:55.575
You're both endangered species!

15:56.786 --> 15:58.788
Take it back!
 Oh, stop it!

15:58.788 --> 16:00.460
You stop it!

16:00.460 --> 16:02.462
Cool. Two girls fighting over me

16:02.462 --> 16:03.713
with a turtle shell?

16:03.713 --> 16:06.716
It's every guy's dream!

16:06.716 --> 16:09.799
I will turn you
into turtle soup!

16:09.799 --> 16:11.801
Hey! Hey! Break it up!

16:11.801 --> 16:13.303
Break it up! Break it up!

16:13.303 --> 16:14.764
Okay. Who's giving me a wedgie?

16:14.764 --> 16:16.726
Stop!

16:16.726 --> 16:19.729
I'm done dealing with you
crazy people.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.312
And to think I stalked
someone for you.

16:22.312 --> 16:25.235
What a waste!

16:25.235 --> 16:27.157
Ha! I win.

16:27.157 --> 16:30.030
You sure do.
You fought for me.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.951
The only reason I was
hanging out with Caitlin

16:31.951 --> 16:34.744
was because you never
give me the time of day.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.117
And now that I know
how you really feel,

16:37.117 --> 16:38.668
I'm all yours.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.121
Wait, what?

16:41.121 --> 16:43.793
Caitlin, come back.

16:43.793 --> 16:46.626
( music playing )

16:46.626 --> 16:49.049
Thanks for dinner, Tasha.
That was delicious.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.681
So nice to have
a home-cooked meal again.

16:51.681 --> 16:52.932
Really?

16:52.932 --> 16:55.095
I thought the chicken
was a little dry.

16:56.806 --> 16:58.898
I can't believe this is
my last night here.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.942
Tasha, is there any way
we can convince you

17:02.942 --> 17:04.404
to change your mind?

17:04.404 --> 17:06.776
Sorry, guys.
My decision is final.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.699
( electricity cracking )

17:09.699 --> 17:12.321
What's going on?

17:12.321 --> 17:13.953
( thuds )

17:13.953 --> 17:16.955
( alarm blaring )

17:18.458 --> 17:19.709
A storm is descending
on the island

17:19.709 --> 17:21.751
with 80-mile-an-hour wind.

17:21.751 --> 17:23.373
It's about to hit us dead-on.

17:23.373 --> 17:25.335
All right. Bree and I will
evacuate the students

17:25.335 --> 17:26.836
to the training area.

17:26.836 --> 17:28.468
You guys batten down
the hatches in here

17:28.468 --> 17:29.759
then meet us downstairs.

17:29.759 --> 17:31.471
Got it.

17:31.471 --> 17:33.673
Very clever, Leo.

17:33.673 --> 17:34.804
I can't believe
you created

17:34.804 --> 17:36.976
another ridiculous set-up.

17:36.976 --> 17:39.139
Eighty-mile-an-hour winds, huh?

17:39.139 --> 17:42.142
What do you got out there,
some kind of giant fan?

17:42.142 --> 17:43.853
No, Mom. This is real.

17:43.853 --> 17:45.735
Oh, please.
If this was a real

17:45.735 --> 17:47.487
tropical storm,

17:47.487 --> 17:50.610
I wouldn't be able
to stand here.

17:50.610 --> 17:52.692
Mom! Hang on.

17:52.692 --> 17:55.535
TASHA: Help!

17:55.535 --> 17:57.327
I'm not one
to believe in karma,

17:57.327 --> 17:58.618
but this might have
something to do

17:58.618 --> 18:00.960
with that horrible chicken.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.462
( screaming )

18:02.462 --> 18:03.913
I'll go get her.

18:03.913 --> 18:05.665
No. I'll do it.

18:05.665 --> 18:07.667
Right. You should be
the last face she sees

18:07.667 --> 18:09.129
before she blows away.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.132
No. She's my mom.
I need to do this.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.844
Okay. But be careful.
I know I say this a lot

18:14.844 --> 18:17.847
but if there's one mission
you might be decapitated on,

18:17.847 --> 18:18.718
this is it.

18:18.718 --> 18:21.931
Hurry! ( screaming )

18:21.931 --> 18:24.684
I can't hold on much longer.

18:24.684 --> 18:26.726
Adam, wait. Anchor me.

18:28.568 --> 18:30.900
Okay. Here it goes.

18:34.033 --> 18:36.786
( screaming )

18:36.786 --> 18:38.828
Mom! On the count of three,

18:38.828 --> 18:41.291
I need you to reach out
and grab my arm.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.082
I don't think I can.

18:43.082 --> 18:45.044
It's okay. I got you.

18:45.044 --> 18:46.666
What if you don't?

18:46.666 --> 18:48.628
I'll blow out to sea.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.129
Trust me. I'll catch you.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.671
But if you don't.

18:51.671 --> 18:54.424
Would you just do it?!

18:54.424 --> 18:56.426
I'm scared, Leo.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.927
I am not going to let anything

18:57.927 --> 18:59.679
happen to you.

18:59.679 --> 19:01.561
Are you ready?

19:01.561 --> 19:04.644
Okay.
 One,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.186
two...

19:06.186 --> 19:08.768
Oh, hang on. I got an itch.

19:10.940 --> 19:13.533
Oh, got it.

19:13.533 --> 19:14.694
Three.

19:14.694 --> 19:17.197
( screaming )

19:18.198 --> 19:19.539
I got you.

19:19.539 --> 19:21.741
( grunting )

19:21.741 --> 19:23.993
Whoa. Nice work.

19:23.993 --> 19:25.415
You did it.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.707
And no one got hurt,
right, Tasha?

19:27.707 --> 19:30.630
( screaming )

19:30.630 --> 19:32.131
Oops.

19:32.131 --> 19:34.714
Anchor me.

19:35.885 --> 19:38.888
( music playing )

19:40.220 --> 19:41.391
Hey, you guys okay?

19:41.391 --> 19:44.764
Yeah. Everyone's accounted for.

19:44.764 --> 19:47.397
Good news, just checked all
the structures on the island,

19:47.397 --> 19:49.769
only minimal damage.

19:49.769 --> 19:52.151
And Caitlin survived too.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.615
That was amazing, Leo.

19:55.615 --> 19:57.987
The way you took charge
and stayed calm

19:57.987 --> 19:59.659
in the face of danger,

19:59.659 --> 20:01.991
I am very impressed.

20:01.991 --> 20:04.784
Oh, Leo does stuff like that
on missions all the time.

20:04.784 --> 20:06.746
Yeah. He's always there for us.

20:06.746 --> 20:08.668
Well, whatever part
of him isn't severed

20:08.668 --> 20:10.750
is always there for us.

20:12.752 --> 20:14.384
You know, I'm still upset
that you lied to me

20:14.384 --> 20:15.755
about the missions.

20:15.755 --> 20:18.678
But it's clear, you are
a big part of this team.

20:18.678 --> 20:20.800
I don't wanna stand
in the way of that.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.221
Thanks, Mom.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.304
And, Tasha, you are always

20:24.304 --> 20:26.015
welcome back to the island.

20:26.015 --> 20:29.018
Just stay out of the kitchen.

20:29.018 --> 20:32.021
( music playing )

20:34.944 --> 20:37.527
Ugly. Ugly.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.909
Ugh.

20:42.702 --> 20:44.704
Hey, Bob, can you
give us a second?

20:44.704 --> 20:46.826
Oh, sure.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.750
Okay.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.423
Caitlin,

20:53.423 --> 20:55.715
I promised myself
I was gonna act mature

20:55.715 --> 20:57.377
and not fight over
pretty things with you,

20:57.377 --> 20:59.088
but I did,

20:59.088 --> 21:01.301
and I'm sorry.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.973
You're welcome to stay
as long as you want.

21:03.973 --> 21:06.516
Ugh, stop!

21:06.516 --> 21:09.519
You're smothering me
with your neediness.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.891
Call me when you grow up.

21:13.853 --> 21:15.775
Hey, I'd never leave you, Bree.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.778
You're the only one for me.

21:18.778 --> 21:19.859
Hey, guys.

21:19.859 --> 21:22.862

21:33.963 --> 21:35.965
