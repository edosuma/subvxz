01:40.409 --> 01:43.811
The apothecary prepared
this liniment, my lord.

01:43.912 --> 01:45.814
He mentioned it might hurt,

01:45.881 --> 01:48.283
but said the pain
was worth enduring.

01:48.384 --> 01:51.820
- Count again?
- Yes, my lord.

01:51.921 --> 01:54.791
Otherwise the
wound might fester.

01:54.858 --> 01:56.793
One...

01:56.860 --> 01:58.828
- One...
- Two...

01:58.896 --> 02:02.800
- Two...
- Three... four...

02:02.867 --> 02:05.470
And we are done,

02:05.571 --> 02:08.472
my good Lord Sforza.

02:08.539 --> 02:12.110
Damn horse. A viper
must have startled him.

02:13.545 --> 02:16.481
But we must count
our blessings, my lord.

02:16.549 --> 02:20.285
You may be some months
in this little room.

02:21.788 --> 02:24.189
At least your leg
has been saved.

02:28.995 --> 02:31.830
You have been kind to me,
Lucrezia Borgia.

02:33.299 --> 02:36.768
And it may be that... I was not,

02:36.836 --> 02:38.770
in the first instance...

02:38.871 --> 02:40.738
kind to you.

02:40.806 --> 02:42.673
Please my lord, do not think-

02:42.741 --> 02:45.676
I see now that nobility

02:45.743 --> 02:48.279
springs from the soul...

02:49.714 --> 02:51.382
not from the blood.

02:52.851 --> 02:57.221
I forgive you the accident
of your family name.

02:59.991 --> 03:03.027
I must... accept
your forgiveness, then,

03:03.128 --> 03:05.196
my lord, for the...

03:06.665 --> 03:09.133
accident of my Borgia blood.

03:10.601 --> 03:13.837
And I would, as a mark
of thanks for your care,

03:13.905 --> 03:16.572
these past few days,
lend you my horse.

03:18.008 --> 03:19.575
Your horse?

03:19.676 --> 03:22.044
He is the very devil
when he's not being ridden.

03:24.647 --> 03:27.849
I will gladly
ride him out, my lord.

03:29.618 --> 03:32.753
King Ferrante of Naples
sends his humble regards.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.663
King Ferrante of Naples can
neither hear nor see, I believe?

03:35.664 --> 03:36.340
Son.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.811
He nevertheless sends
his every good wish.

03:39.095 --> 03:42.431
And in the face of all of the
spurious claims upon his kingdom-

03:42.532 --> 03:45.134
from Spain, from France
from the Duchy of Milan-

03:45.202 --> 03:47.971
he would remind
Your Holiness of the justice

03:48.039 --> 03:50.407
of the independent
claims of Naples.

03:50.474 --> 03:52.409
An independent Naples

03:52.477 --> 03:55.246
can only be to Rome's benefit.

03:55.313 --> 03:58.416
And I, as his ambassador,
am proud to present the suit,

03:58.484 --> 04:01.787
for your consideration,
of his last unmarried daughter,

04:01.855 --> 04:03.355
Sancia,

04:03.456 --> 04:06.224
Duchessa of Squillace.

04:06.292 --> 04:08.426
Where is Squillace?

04:08.494 --> 04:11.128
In the Kingdom of Naples.

04:25.375 --> 04:28.245
My younger brother Joffre
is all of 13 years old.

04:28.346 --> 04:31.882
His Highness had understood
the prospective groom to be

04:31.983 --> 04:35.086
the Gonfaloniere himself,
the Duke of Gandia.

04:35.154 --> 04:37.088
Me?

04:37.156 --> 04:39.224
Well, this is most irregular.

04:39.292 --> 04:41.418
I would never consider marrying
the illegitimate daughter

04:41.419 --> 04:42.157
of the King of Naples-

04:42.162 --> 04:45.265
Would you convey our thanks
to our friend and ally,

04:45.366 --> 04:49.435
King Ferrante,
whose claim to independence

04:49.503 --> 04:53.439
we fully understand,
for his most generous offer?

04:58.745 --> 05:02.081
You will have
our response shortly.

05:06.186 --> 05:09.088
My husband cannot ride.

05:09.189 --> 05:11.191
He cannot rut.

05:11.292 --> 05:13.726
He cannot even hunt.

05:13.794 --> 05:16.362
Even the deer are happy.

05:16.464 --> 05:18.531
Will I be
punished for that?

05:18.599 --> 05:20.700
Will I be whipped?

05:20.768 --> 05:23.203
For making the deer happy?

05:23.270 --> 05:26.272
Are you happy, my lady?

05:26.340 --> 05:28.207
Perhaps.

05:28.309 --> 05:30.710
- Give the horse his heed.
- But no whip?

05:30.778 --> 05:32.712
No need for whip.
Kick your heels.

05:42.255 --> 05:44.189
You thought
it appropriate?

05:44.290 --> 05:47.241
I, Juan Borgia, and the
illegitimate daughter

05:47.242 --> 05:48.936
of the King of Naples?

05:49.158 --> 05:51.179
The Duchessa
of Squillace?

05:51.230 --> 05:53.164
Our alliance with Naples

05:53.232 --> 05:55.667
is now of the utmost importance.

05:55.735 --> 05:57.669
I am the Duke of Gandia.

05:57.736 --> 06:00.171
The Gonfaloniere
of the papal state.

06:00.239 --> 06:02.473
The son of
the Pope of Rome.

06:02.574 --> 06:05.008
- Oh, Brother, we both are that.
- Oh, you marry her then.

06:05.076 --> 06:08.112
You know marriage for
me is not an option.

06:10.081 --> 06:13.584
Well, then, let it be Joffre!

06:13.651 --> 06:15.752
Joffre still plays
with his sister's dolls.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.754
Here we have
a life-size one.

06:17.822 --> 06:21.357
Lucrezia still plays
with dolls. She got married.

06:21.425 --> 06:24.026
She did.

06:24.094 --> 06:26.496
Are we to send all of our
loved ones off to Pesaro?

06:26.597 --> 06:28.565
To Squillace?

06:28.666 --> 06:31.301
I will not marry
the Duchessa of Squillace.

06:31.369 --> 06:34.772
But I will ride to Naples to
present my young brother's suit.

06:34.873 --> 06:37.041
Juan...

06:37.109 --> 06:38.656
One of us must ensure that she
is a suitable bride.

06:38.681 --> 06:40.081
Or would you prefer
the honour?

06:40.146 --> 06:43.482
I cannot.
I am occupied in Rome.

06:43.549 --> 06:46.585
Yes, so I've heard.

06:46.652 --> 06:49.320
What have you heard?

06:49.388 --> 06:53.123
That beneath that cardinal's
skirt, there may still be a man.

06:53.224 --> 06:55.559
Uh, uh...

07:01.298 --> 07:03.832
- Look at you.
- Me?

07:03.900 --> 07:05.767
Like Narcissus.

07:05.868 --> 07:07.937
In the spring waters.

07:09.373 --> 07:11.140
Narcissus?

07:14.078 --> 07:16.146
You don't know Narcissus?

07:17.749 --> 07:20.952
I can neither read nor
write, my Lady Lucrezia.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.496
Narcissus fell in love
with his own reflection.

07:30.563 --> 07:32.798
In the waters of a spring.

07:37.135 --> 07:38.803
Do not move.

07:45.876 --> 07:48.311
It is impossible.

07:48.378 --> 07:51.248
To fall in love
with a reflection?

07:53.550 --> 07:55.318
To kiss it.

08:07.364 --> 08:10.266
And I thought I would
never know sweetness.

08:28.953 --> 08:31.722
It's your residence, Cardinal?

08:31.823 --> 08:33.722
For the moment.

08:33.823 --> 08:36.426
You are spare in
your tastes, Cardinal.

08:36.494 --> 08:39.529
There is but one
ornament I need here.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.836
May I call you something
other than Cardinal?

08:50.341 --> 08:52.242
Call me Cesare.

08:52.310 --> 08:54.544
Cesare.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.382
Remind me why I'm here, Cesare.

09:01.986 --> 09:04.253
Because you want to be.

09:05.989 --> 09:07.924
Because...

09:08.025 --> 09:11.193
Your husband's absence
makes it possible.

09:11.294 --> 09:13.362
Because...

09:13.464 --> 09:17.100
It is time to
stop pretending.

09:17.167 --> 09:20.837
Please. I do
not trust my heart.

09:20.938 --> 09:23.472
Oh, you must, to
have come here with me.

09:25.309 --> 09:28.278
Can you love me,
Cesare Borgia?

09:28.345 --> 09:31.848
Or is it just
desires of the flesh?

09:34.785 --> 09:38.388
I am very much afraid
that it is both.

09:40.325 --> 09:42.826
One or the other,
I could deal with.

09:42.894 --> 09:45.763
Both, and I may be lost.

09:51.737 --> 09:54.137
Can a good thing
come from a bad thing,

09:54.239 --> 09:56.139
Paolo the groom?

09:56.241 --> 09:59.009
Is this a good thing?

09:59.077 --> 10:01.945
Yes. I think.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.015
And what is the bad?

10:06.083 --> 10:08.317
I think you know...

10:10.254 --> 10:12.189
Paolo the groom.

10:12.257 --> 10:14.225
I have a second name.

10:14.292 --> 10:16.494
And I don't
want to know it.

10:20.934 --> 10:24.937
I would call you Narcissus.

10:42.655 --> 10:44.689
Oh, my God.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.068
You make me hope.

10:56.504 --> 10:58.605
And I'm afraid of hope.

11:01.009 --> 11:02.943
Hope for what?

11:03.011 --> 11:04.978
For days like this.

11:05.046 --> 11:07.247
In the future, with you.

11:09.351 --> 11:11.418
If you were given them?

11:14.522 --> 11:16.958
I beg you, do
not make me hope.

11:17.025 --> 11:19.060
He will be home
in two days.

11:21.863 --> 11:24.432
Perhaps his business
will detain him.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.810
Now, I desire a
purely defensive union.

11:36.246 --> 11:37.889
The terms of which have
already been outlined by

11:37.914 --> 11:39.364
our respective ambassadors.

11:41.352 --> 11:44.455
And I desire the happiness
of our youngest son.

11:44.523 --> 11:47.159
And 200,000
ducats, surely.

11:47.226 --> 11:49.261
Perhaps.

11:50.896 --> 11:54.600
But we need this union
more than we need riches.

11:56.069 --> 11:59.104
The wolves are bearing
down on the Papal States.

12:03.209 --> 12:06.278
And... we would
have a wedding...

12:09.716 --> 12:12.718
if only to once again
see our dear Lucrezia.

12:27.569 --> 12:29.570
Yah!

12:35.510 --> 12:37.445
Forgive me,
Gonfaloniere Borgia,

12:37.513 --> 12:39.848
if I feed my
father as we converse.

12:39.916 --> 12:44.653
He has so few pleasures left.
But he does like his chicken!

12:44.754 --> 12:47.122
What a coincidence.

12:47.190 --> 12:50.292
Chicken is my brother
Joffre's favourite.

12:50.359 --> 12:52.760
Perhaps my sister
can feed him thus.

12:52.862 --> 12:55.630
He is all of 13 years old.
Soon to be a man.

12:55.697 --> 12:58.632
I am truly blessed
then, in this union.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.768
You are.

13:00.869 --> 13:02.913
And your brother,
Gonfaloniere,

13:02.938 --> 13:04.638
is he illegitimate,
like me?

13:04.706 --> 13:07.475
His father has drafted
a papal bull

13:07.576 --> 13:09.844
to confer legitimacy
on all his children.

13:09.945 --> 13:13.048
And that has bearing on the
matter of bastardy, does it?

13:13.149 --> 13:16.852
We do not appreciate that
term, Your Highness.

13:16.953 --> 13:20.023
Why not?
I never minded it.

13:20.124 --> 13:23.961
I found it gave
one a certain licence.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.500
Let me just say that his
rights of inheritance

13:29.601 --> 13:32.836
are secure, under law.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.739
If my betrothed

13:35.807 --> 13:37.975
has anything like the
vigour of his brother...

13:40.312 --> 13:42.513
You would marry this Borgia
here, would you not, dear sis?

13:42.614 --> 13:45.884
I am your
bastard sister, Alfonso.

13:45.951 --> 13:49.320
I shall marry
whomever I am told.

13:50.756 --> 13:53.024
I am sure your brother

13:53.092 --> 13:55.694
should grow into your
stature, Gonfaloniere.

13:55.795 --> 13:59.231
It comes with many benefits: the
Borgia name, the Borgia prowess.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.233
I am told it
is considerable,

14:01.300 --> 14:03.702
within and without
the marital bed.

14:03.770 --> 14:06.204
Most important of all, the
protection of the Pope of Rome

14:06.272 --> 14:09.708
for our poor, beleaguered
kingdom of Naples.

14:09.809 --> 14:13.079
We have enemies fast
approaching, Gonfaloniere.

14:13.146 --> 14:16.215
My father's name was once
enough to terrify them.

14:16.282 --> 14:19.218
Perhaps your father's name
should do the same?

14:19.286 --> 14:22.355
I have been entrusted with
all of my father's battles.

14:29.297 --> 14:32.166
- Are you not scared, dear sis?
- I fear...

14:32.267 --> 14:35.770
I fear, I fear.

14:35.838 --> 14:39.074
Perhaps after our
meal, Gonfaloniere,

14:39.175 --> 14:41.243
my sister can give
you the royal tour?

14:41.344 --> 14:45.414
My father had a way of, uh,
dealing with his enemies.

14:45.482 --> 14:49.084
It might prove instructive
for the future.

14:53.223 --> 14:56.959
- Your father had them stuffed?
- Indeed.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.631
Clever.

15:01.732 --> 15:04.802
His reputation
then preceded him.

15:04.903 --> 15:08.272
As does your reputation
precede you.

15:08.339 --> 15:11.975
Does it? Should I be honoured?

15:13.411 --> 15:16.279
In my father's case,
it inspired terror.

15:17.748 --> 15:19.515
What do I inspire,

15:19.583 --> 15:21.751
Juan Borgia?

15:23.253 --> 15:24.654
Lust.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.455
Then I must make do...

15:26.556 --> 15:28.290
with lust.

15:30.226 --> 15:33.294
You would sample your
brother's betrothed

15:33.395 --> 15:35.296
the way you would a mare?

15:35.397 --> 15:37.664
But one of such beauty.

15:37.765 --> 15:39.933
Sample her, then.

15:43.503 --> 15:46.104
- I would know...
- Ah!

15:46.172 --> 15:49.541
- How she can be ridden.
- Oh, she can.

15:49.609 --> 15:52.477
She can.

16:22.140 --> 16:26.009
You find the art of politics
more engrossing than...

16:27.912 --> 16:31.081
Than-
Than the art of love?

16:31.149 --> 16:33.216
Did I say that?

16:35.653 --> 16:38.721
They have more in common
than you might think.

16:40.257 --> 16:42.291
I would doubt that.

16:51.968 --> 16:54.037
Let us take...

16:56.974 --> 16:59.209
your most elegant leg.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.915
A perfect metaphor

17:03.982 --> 17:06.017
for Italian politics.

17:10.255 --> 17:11.689
Here...

17:11.756 --> 17:14.290
we have France,

17:14.358 --> 17:17.227
the source of all disquiet.

17:18.628 --> 17:20.429
But travelling south

17:20.530 --> 17:22.698
across the Alps...

17:25.835 --> 17:28.603
we find the dukedom of Milan.

17:28.671 --> 17:30.605
Hmm?

17:30.673 --> 17:33.508
And below her,

17:33.576 --> 17:35.477
Florence.

17:35.544 --> 17:37.579
And here,

17:37.646 --> 17:39.947
this little mound...

17:42.251 --> 17:44.318
is Rome.

17:48.123 --> 17:50.158
But Naples...

17:51.594 --> 17:53.962
is your elegant calf...

17:55.898 --> 17:57.966
your exquisite ankle...

18:00.069 --> 18:01.803
your heel...

18:03.706 --> 18:06.574
your sole...

18:08.043 --> 18:11.312
and your most
delicious toe.

18:17.419 --> 18:19.620
Now lying here...

18:21.123 --> 18:23.324
it may not seem important.

18:26.027 --> 18:27.962
But try to stand,

18:28.030 --> 18:30.431
and you'll find that
all your balance comes

18:30.532 --> 18:33.000
from here.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.903
- Naples.
- Hmm.

18:36.004 --> 18:38.072
Naples.

18:44.046 --> 18:45.614
But now...

18:50.053 --> 18:53.087
I'm going to invade...

18:54.890 --> 18:57.458
fair France.

19:12.973 --> 19:15.341
His Highness is testing
a new cannon, Your Eminence.

19:15.409 --> 19:19.011
Perfected during a battle
against those English barbarians.

19:30.924 --> 19:33.192
Fire!

19:39.566 --> 19:41.568
<i>Feu!</i>

19:43.671 --> 19:46.373
Le feu aux canons! Les boulets!

19:48.343 --> 19:50.010
Your Royal Highness,

19:50.111 --> 19:52.011
may I introduce you

19:52.113 --> 19:55.381
to Cardinal Giuliano
Della Rovere.

19:55.482 --> 19:57.750
Cardinal Della Rovere,

19:57.818 --> 20:00.552
His Royal Highness,
King Charles,

20:00.653 --> 20:02.387
of France.

20:02.489 --> 20:05.757
- Your Royal Highness.
- We have heard of you.

20:05.825 --> 20:08.760
And I of you,
Your Highness.

20:08.828 --> 20:11.497
Your military renown has
travelled far and wide-

20:11.598 --> 20:13.833
Enough of the
pleasantries!

20:13.934 --> 20:18.037
You are the one that would
give us the crown of Naples?

20:21.008 --> 20:24.745
The Kingdom of France
has long had claims

20:24.846 --> 20:27.748
on the investiture of
the Kingdom of Naples.

20:27.849 --> 20:29.650
I would-

20:29.717 --> 20:32.753
I said, enough
pleasantries, did I not?

20:34.188 --> 20:36.090
Just tell me, Cardinal,

20:36.191 --> 20:39.461
how you would place
the crown of Naples...

20:40.964 --> 20:42.931
on this ugly head of mine?

20:42.999 --> 20:45.233
And it is

20:45.335 --> 20:48.603
exceedingly ugly, is it not?

20:48.671 --> 20:52.506
Your Highness bears all the vigour
of the French race in his person.

20:52.607 --> 20:54.675
He is afraid to say it!

20:56.077 --> 20:59.946
Is my head not ugly, General?
I can hardly bear to gaze at it.

21:00.013 --> 21:01.880
So admit it, Cardinal.

21:01.982 --> 21:03.882
I have all the graces

21:03.983 --> 21:05.885
of a carnival dwarf.

21:05.986 --> 21:09.789
Those words would never pass
my lips, Your Highness.

21:09.857 --> 21:11.925
Well then, we
may get nowhere.

21:11.992 --> 21:14.795
I appreciate only
plain speech.

21:21.571 --> 21:25.607
Tell us then what
you want of us, plainly.

21:27.911 --> 21:30.713
My countrymen are accustomed
to the show of war,

21:30.814 --> 21:32.214
not the reality.

21:32.282 --> 21:35.684
They could never muster
the courage to sustain your

21:35.752 --> 21:37.887
French fury.

21:39.289 --> 21:43.159
You want me to march to Rome,
depose that Borgia,

21:43.227 --> 21:45.528
give you the papal crown,

21:45.596 --> 21:48.798
in the hope that you'll
place the crown of Naples

21:48.900 --> 21:51.167
on this ugly head?

21:51.268 --> 21:53.870
I want to restore
the Universal Church

21:53.937 --> 21:55.905
to her former dignity.

21:55.973 --> 21:58.074
Couldn't this
Borgia do the same?

21:58.142 --> 21:59.809
Restore the Church?

21:59.910 --> 22:02.045
Place the Crown of Naples

22:02.112 --> 22:04.247
on this ugly noggin.

22:04.315 --> 22:05.548
Noggin?

22:05.650 --> 22:08.818
Head.

22:08.885 --> 22:12.421
Either way, you must
get to Rome, Your Highness.

22:12.489 --> 22:13.747
Must I?

22:13.772 --> 22:15.922
And my countrymen are
accustomed to the show of war-

22:15.925 --> 22:18.526
Oh lord!

22:31.171 --> 22:34.707
My husband has been
absent all of a week now.

22:38.011 --> 22:40.179
You said he
went to Ostia.

22:41.581 --> 22:43.649
Are there not
women in Ostia?

22:46.085 --> 22:48.620
You say that so bluntly,
Cesare Borgia.

22:50.123 --> 22:52.625
It makes me fearful.
Of what?

22:55.095 --> 22:57.697
Of the consequences
of your affections.

22:57.765 --> 23:01.001
Can you not give thanks for
the time we have spent together?

23:02.437 --> 23:04.371
Thanks to whom?

23:04.439 --> 23:07.841
To the moon. To Venus.

23:07.942 --> 23:11.345
To, dare I say, the good Lord.

23:14.783 --> 23:17.184
Does He not look down
upon us this minute?

23:17.285 --> 23:19.186
If He sees what I see,

23:19.287 --> 23:21.889
He sees that it is good.

23:21.956 --> 23:25.025
You were ordained
a priest,

23:25.126 --> 23:27.027
and yet you
blaspheme thus.

23:27.128 --> 23:30.564
If appreciation of
your beauty is blasphemy,

23:30.632 --> 23:33.034
consider me a blasphemer indeed.

23:34.470 --> 23:36.538
A blasphemer and a heretic.

23:37.974 --> 23:39.941
You frighten me, sometimes.

23:46.282 --> 23:50.019
War is ugly, Cardinal.

23:50.087 --> 23:53.322
Far uglier than
I could ever be.

23:54.759 --> 23:56.660
One should approach it

23:56.761 --> 23:59.863
with extreme
circumspection.

23:59.931 --> 24:02.499
As one should
approach you, perhaps?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.034
Ha!

24:04.102 --> 24:08.306
He is learning to
mean what he says!

24:09.741 --> 24:12.142
But as to war, see here.

24:14.112 --> 24:16.680
My new invention.

24:16.747 --> 24:19.282
If it works,

24:19.349 --> 24:21.284
it will be...

24:21.351 --> 24:23.852
truly grisly.

24:26.122 --> 24:29.125
It will usher in a whole new era

24:29.226 --> 24:31.327
of grisliness.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.565
Chained cannonballs.

24:35.632 --> 24:38.334
Both balls

24:38.435 --> 24:40.937
have to fire together.

24:41.005 --> 24:42.872
If they don't,

24:42.974 --> 24:45.475
we could be torn to shreds.

24:46.912 --> 24:49.147
You wish to give
the signal?

24:50.883 --> 24:53.318
It would be my privilege,
Your Highness.

24:53.386 --> 24:55.488
It could also be your end.

24:55.555 --> 24:58.324
Your most grisly end.

24:58.392 --> 25:00.960
Yours too.

25:04.499 --> 25:07.500
Proceed.

25:27.118 --> 25:29.787
Impressive.

26:00.822 --> 26:03.557
Yes?

26:06.495 --> 26:08.365
Narcissus.

26:08.390 --> 26:10.164
If Lord Sforza
were to find us-

26:10.165 --> 26:14.269
How could he...
mount those stairs?

27:02.482 --> 27:05.217
What? Hmm...

27:06.653 --> 27:08.554
The devil!

27:51.030 --> 27:53.598
Butter, my Lord Sforza.

27:53.699 --> 27:55.768
For the morning.

28:13.619 --> 28:16.522
- You met my betrothed, Brother?
- I did.

28:20.795 --> 28:23.063
Your silence
is alarming, Brother.

28:23.164 --> 28:25.065
Put little Joffre at ease.

28:25.166 --> 28:28.068
Rest assured, Joffre,
she does not have horns.

28:28.135 --> 28:30.971
Is she pretty?

28:31.072 --> 28:33.707
No.

28:35.976 --> 28:37.877
Is she kind?

28:37.978 --> 28:39.978
I know not.

28:41.447 --> 28:44.315
Does she have any
qualities to recommend her?

28:45.717 --> 28:47.784
She has two legs.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.688
The requisite number of eyes.
Ten fingers.

28:51.789 --> 28:54.057
So she is not pretty

28:54.125 --> 28:56.059
and she is not kind.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.228
She has two eyes,

28:58.295 --> 29:01.264
ten fingers, and two legs.

29:01.332 --> 29:04.534
Not forgetting toes.
Ten of them, I believe.

29:05.969 --> 29:08.437
I will only marry
once, Mother.

29:12.243 --> 29:14.678
Oh, little Joffre!

29:14.746 --> 29:16.713
She is not only pretty.
No?

29:16.815 --> 29:19.783
- She is beautiful!
- Really?

29:19.851 --> 29:22.786
And she's an angel, sprung up
on the soils of Naples.

29:22.854 --> 29:26.457
In fact, if you will not marry
her, I would marry her myself.

29:26.524 --> 29:28.625
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

29:28.727 --> 29:30.627
Now, do I have
your permission?

29:30.695 --> 29:33.097
You may not, Juan.
She is my betrothed.

29:33.198 --> 29:36.633
Yes, she is. And
who's a lucky boy?

29:52.684 --> 29:56.620
He looks wealthy. Who is he,
do you think? Nobleman?

29:56.688 --> 30:00.157
I don't know. We all look
the same when we're dead.

30:00.225 --> 30:02.893
Certainly dressed the part.

30:07.632 --> 30:10.367
You would entice
me to battle...

30:11.837 --> 30:15.340
but do you understand
what that means?

30:16.776 --> 30:19.378
It means a just war,
in defence of Christendom.

30:19.479 --> 30:21.981
No war is just.

30:22.048 --> 30:23.983
War is chaos,

30:24.051 --> 30:27.020
brute force mustered
against brute force,

30:27.087 --> 30:30.556
until one side
is destroyed, utterly.

30:33.827 --> 30:36.261
I have read of
your Italian battles.

30:36.329 --> 30:39.264
Hired mercenaries,
on feathered horseback,

30:39.332 --> 30:42.033
prancing like peacocks
one against the other

30:42.134 --> 30:44.035
until one side retires,

30:44.103 --> 30:47.305
with something called honour?

30:47.406 --> 30:49.308
Heh!

30:49.409 --> 30:51.577
But there is
no honour in war.

30:51.645 --> 30:55.381
The French learned that
against the English.

30:57.185 --> 30:59.319
There is blood, death,

30:59.387 --> 31:01.589
armour against armour,

31:01.690 --> 31:04.292
until one side surrenders,

31:04.360 --> 31:08.097
in death or domination.

31:09.533 --> 31:13.602
Be careful what you pray for
Cardinal, if you pray for war.

31:15.038 --> 31:18.307
You will find
yourself in a place

31:18.374 --> 31:21.477
beyond prayer itself.

31:24.047 --> 31:26.649
As St. Augustine
said, Mother...

31:28.052 --> 31:31.588
Let me be married,
Lord, but not yet!

31:35.594 --> 31:38.396
- My dear.
- Theo.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.701
Your dear?

31:46.840 --> 31:49.341
I'd heard you made
your reappearance.

31:49.409 --> 31:50.353
Juan.

31:50.378 --> 31:52.781
Is the house my father
bought you not to your liking?

31:54.380 --> 31:55.780
Too cold?

31:55.881 --> 31:58.783
Too lonely, perhaps?

31:58.850 --> 32:01.785
Um, I would
leave you, kind sir,

32:01.853 --> 32:04.154
and trouble you no further.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.324
- Yes, you will leave.
- MY SON!

32:07.425 --> 32:09.957
Yes, I am your son. Does this
peasant's presence here mean

32:09.982 --> 32:11.541
that he thinks he's my father?

32:11.563 --> 32:14.598
- No!
- JUAN, PLEASE!

32:14.666 --> 32:17.263
He must have heard the rumours
that one of us was fathered

32:17.288 --> 32:18.488
by this goatherd.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.538
- Juan, stop!
- We are the sons of the pope!

32:21.639 --> 32:24.441
And you entertain a goatherd?

32:24.542 --> 32:28.512
In my family home?
Juan!

32:31.049 --> 32:34.419
What has this
papacy done to you?

32:34.487 --> 32:37.156
It has removed me forever
from the likes of him.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.792
Go.

32:39.893 --> 32:41.994
Leave.

32:42.095 --> 32:45.732
This is your home no longer.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.168
I will return, Mother,
when I please.

32:48.269 --> 32:51.537
But I will not have him here!
I said...

32:51.605 --> 32:53.639
Go.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.929
I asked to meet
you here because...

33:16.997 --> 33:19.065
my husband has been found.

33:21.668 --> 33:24.437
Washed up on the
shores of the Tiber,

33:24.505 --> 33:26.639
3 weeks dead

33:26.707 --> 33:29.109
with stab wounds
to his neck.

33:31.178 --> 33:33.280
For those 3 weeks

33:33.347 --> 33:35.916
I gave my body to you.

33:37.352 --> 33:39.452
I broke my marriage vows.

33:41.122 --> 33:42.889
I thought...

33:42.957 --> 33:45.725
perhaps I hoped
you did so willingly.

33:45.793 --> 33:49.562
You bought those
3 weeks with murder!

33:52.131 --> 33:55.533
I told you he was riding on
the road to Ostia that night.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.903
Admit it, Cardinal.
I admit nothing.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.205
Yet the crime is
written on your face.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.941
There was no murder.
He fought. He lost.

34:11.047 --> 34:13.282
I begged you not to meet him.

34:13.350 --> 34:16.953
You begged me not to place
myself in harm's way.

34:17.021 --> 34:19.589
I had no idea you
had such capabilities.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.458
And to think I
thought you knew me.

34:22.525 --> 34:24.860
I thought I knew a man.

34:24.963 --> 34:27.398
A man conflicted, perhaps,
between the world and God.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.399
But not a murderer.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.203
Is it murder to defend
your mother's honour?

34:34.172 --> 34:36.741
To procure the freedom
of one you could love...

34:36.809 --> 34:39.511
even more than
your mother's honour?

34:44.283 --> 34:46.784
If it is, I am a murderer born.

34:46.853 --> 34:49.853
Maybe God can forgive you
because I'm not sure I can.

34:49.922 --> 34:53.123
Do you think I care
for the forgiveness of God?

34:55.393 --> 34:57.829
I care for your
happiness, your future.

34:57.896 --> 35:01.832
And I have now given it to you.
<i>Libera me,</i> you asked me.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.967
You have not
given me a future.

35:04.068 --> 35:06.503
You have given me
a lifelong penance.

35:06.571 --> 35:09.139
I am party to your crime.

35:14.111 --> 35:16.145
I feel for you still...

35:17.581 --> 35:19.148
but I know not

35:19.249 --> 35:21.149
this monster beside me.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.251
Well, let me tell you.

35:26.221 --> 35:29.524
I was born... with a stain.

35:29.591 --> 35:31.525
A mark.

35:31.593 --> 35:33.794
Like the mark of Cain.

35:33.896 --> 35:37.664
But it is the mark of
my father, my family.

35:39.701 --> 35:41.702
The mark of Borgia.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.873
I have tried to
be other than I am.

35:51.046 --> 35:53.081
And I have failed.

35:54.717 --> 35:57.720
And if I have failed you in
the process, I am truly sorry.

35:59.957 --> 36:01.524
You...

36:06.464 --> 36:08.865
You have the devil's
insight, Cardinal.

36:10.501 --> 36:13.536
You read what my heart wanted
and you gave it to me.

36:15.305 --> 36:17.407
You gave me joy,

36:17.474 --> 36:20.710
through a crime
I could not have conceived of.

36:24.648 --> 36:27.249
And now I must live
my life in penance,

36:27.317 --> 36:29.418
praying for forgiveness.

36:30.821 --> 36:33.322
Where?

36:33.389 --> 36:35.790
You will not know where.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.260
You mean a nunnery?

36:39.361 --> 36:41.262
I mean confinement.

36:41.330 --> 36:44.999
I will search you out.
Like Abelard and Eloise.

36:46.501 --> 36:49.738
You may find a nunnery cell, but
you will never be free of me!

36:49.806 --> 36:51.740
You are right.

36:51.808 --> 36:54.877
I will never
be free of you.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.564
Are you out of your mind?

37:15.334 --> 37:18.436
To spill the blood
of your mother's husband?

37:20.339 --> 37:23.641
To beat him like a common pimp?

37:23.709 --> 37:24.862
If that is what he is, Father-

37:24.887 --> 37:26.639
If that is what he is, then
what does that make you?

37:31.550 --> 37:33.483
You've heard the rumour.

37:33.551 --> 37:35.919
That one of us was sired by him,

37:36.020 --> 37:38.921
and not by you,
not by the Pope of Rome?

37:39.023 --> 37:41.557
And you want to
feed these rumours?

37:43.293 --> 37:46.295
What is all of Rome
talking about now?

37:46.363 --> 37:48.998
Hmm?

37:49.065 --> 37:51.901
- I will not have him in her house!
- You will-

37:55.239 --> 37:58.909
You will not?

38:00.378 --> 38:02.379
Do you have any idea

38:02.447 --> 38:04.381
what lengths I've gone to

38:04.449 --> 38:07.484
to keep your mother's
reputation intact?

38:09.420 --> 38:13.023
You were bred to
be a soldier,

38:13.091 --> 38:15.659
a general,

38:15.760 --> 38:18.328
a leader of men.

38:19.764 --> 38:23.233
Is that any way for a
Gonfaloniere to behave?

38:23.300 --> 38:27.036
Brawling like a common soldier,
in your mother's home?

38:27.137 --> 38:30.373
Forgive me, Father,
if my honour demanded-

38:30.441 --> 38:33.109
Your honour?

38:37.248 --> 38:40.016
Do you know what
they say about you?

38:41.452 --> 38:44.222
What they whisper
about you?

38:44.289 --> 38:46.857
What, Father?

38:46.958 --> 38:50.293
That your brother would be
more suited to your estate.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.599
Would you have us

38:55.666 --> 38:57.967
consider those thoughts?

39:04.440 --> 39:06.708
Promise me you won't, Father.

39:11.147 --> 39:13.983
If you promise
to restrain yourself.

39:15.419 --> 39:17.353
I do.

39:17.454 --> 39:20.257
Then promise me that I am of
your blood and of no one else's.

39:24.030 --> 39:27.265
You are our son.

39:30.470 --> 39:32.538
No one else's.

39:34.507 --> 39:37.610
Do not make us regret that fact.

39:39.979 --> 39:42.081
I will not.

39:45.351 --> 39:48.253
How can I make recompense?

39:48.321 --> 39:51.189
You can beg forgiveness
from your mother.

39:52.892 --> 39:56.961
And you can escort her to
your brother Joffre's wedding.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.988
Papa.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.459
Papa.

40:35.101 --> 40:37.168
Ah...

40:39.105 --> 40:41.639
Oh, my love.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.912
I'm in heaven.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.850
Or am I still dreaming?
No, Father.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.718
It is I.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.066
The Borgia pope has
betrothed his son to

41:07.091 --> 41:08.491
King Ferrante's daughter.

41:08.566 --> 41:11.101
How does that change matters?

41:11.202 --> 41:13.469
The investiture of Naples
must soon follow.

41:13.537 --> 41:16.173
Ferrante would have not agreed
to the match without it.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.108
He is old, this Ferrante,
and uglier than me.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.578
But his son
is not, my liege.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.998
He would see his father invested
before he dies,

41:24.023 --> 41:25.523
so he can claim
the crown, and the kingdom.

41:25.616 --> 41:29.286
If there is a moment to move,
it is now.

41:40.767 --> 41:42.501
Cesare!

41:43.970 --> 41:46.873
- Excuse me, Cardinal.
- Yes.

41:56.016 --> 41:57.951
So tell me,
Lucrezia.

41:58.018 --> 41:59.952
Marriage is-

42:00.054 --> 42:01.954
It...

42:02.056 --> 42:04.590
was hard,
at first.

42:07.528 --> 42:09.428
But then it
grew sweeter.

42:09.529 --> 42:11.431
I need
details.

42:11.532 --> 42:13.599
You will
not have them.

42:27.714 --> 42:30.416
Your husband,
Giovanni...

42:31.885 --> 42:35.254
He... fell off his horse.

42:36.756 --> 42:38.256
Foolish man.

42:38.357 --> 42:41.426
He will go hunting.

42:41.493 --> 42:44.695
I find the more
confined husbands

42:44.796 --> 42:48.765
become the
more... tolerable.

42:48.834 --> 42:52.236
I could write
a book about it.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.807
Perhaps I will.

42:57.243 --> 43:00.613
And you, Brother?
What of your heart?

43:03.250 --> 43:06.152
It was broken-by a nun.

43:06.254 --> 43:09.989
A nun? Like Eloise?

43:11.925 --> 43:14.526
Will you spend a lifetime
writing to her?

43:14.594 --> 43:17.362
I could if I knew
where she was.

43:18.764 --> 43:20.999
But you can
find out, surely.

43:22.434 --> 43:24.534
I intend to.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.870
How wonderful.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.173
We can both write books.

43:36.246 --> 43:37.914
The cutting of your hair

43:38.015 --> 43:40.550
is a symbol...

43:43.454 --> 43:45.722
of the renunciation

43:45.790 --> 43:47.891
of your earthly
beauty...

43:54.633 --> 43:57.903
which is now
in the service

43:57.970 --> 44:00.005
of our Lord God...

44:03.276 --> 44:04.811
Jesus Christ.

44:06.247 --> 44:08.381
♪

44:34.806 --> 44:37.007
You will be
a bride of Christ...

44:42.081 --> 44:44.950
a handmaiden of Christ.

44:51.091 --> 44:53.492
Christ will be your love,

44:53.593 --> 44:55.994
your bread...

44:57.964 --> 45:00.132
your wine...

45:05.304 --> 45:07.304
your water.

45:19.285 --> 45:22.020
♪

45:45.075 --> 45:47.510
Most worthy Lord...

45:49.312 --> 45:53.149
do you agree,
under the eyes of God,

45:53.250 --> 45:56.753
to accept the most gracious
Sancia, Duchessa of Squillace,

45:56.821 --> 46:00.057
as your lawful spouse?

46:00.158 --> 46:02.059
I do.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.595
She is too beautiful.

46:04.697 --> 46:06.664
I hate her.

46:06.732 --> 46:10.068
You have promised to marry
the most gracious Sancia, here present...

46:10.169 --> 46:13.972
If you hate beauty, dear sis,
you must hate yourself.

46:17.043 --> 46:18.977
All right.

46:19.045 --> 46:21.145
I will love her then.

46:23.582 --> 46:26.617
But deep down, somewhere,
I still hate her.

46:30.355 --> 46:32.790
One can hate and
love, I have found.

46:32.858 --> 46:36.528
There was a poem, wasn't
there, that said just that.

46:37.964 --> 46:40.165
<i>Odi et amo.</i>

46:40.233 --> 46:41.967
Most gracious lady,

46:42.068 --> 46:45.704
do you agree, under
the eyes of God,

46:45.772 --> 46:49.042
to accept the most noble Lord
Joffre as your lawful spouse?

46:49.109 --> 46:51.177
I do.

46:51.245 --> 46:54.413
Poor Joffre.

46:54.481 --> 46:57.082
He deserved better
than Naples.

47:00.353 --> 47:02.788
Are you becoming
expert in genealogy?

47:02.856 --> 47:06.358
I have heard the rumours
of her monstrous father.

47:08.829 --> 47:11.997
And you believed them?

47:13.466 --> 47:15.368
Why Naples?

47:15.469 --> 47:18.070
Our father has
a realm to protect.

47:18.171 --> 47:20.272
And Sancia
will protect it?

47:23.177 --> 47:24.349
We must wait and see.

47:24.374 --> 47:26.605
...worthy and ready to
enter the marriage contract.

47:29.683 --> 47:32.452
You are now
Duke of Squillace,

47:32.520 --> 47:34.454
Joffre Borgia.

47:34.522 --> 47:36.456
How does that feel?

47:36.557 --> 47:38.624
Where is Squillace?

47:38.692 --> 47:40.927
I have no idea.

47:40.994 --> 47:43.195
But I am its duchess.

47:43.296 --> 47:46.565
There's a castle, I believe,
just south of Naples.

47:46.666 --> 47:49.935
And a lake. An income.

47:50.037 --> 47:54.006
You see, they had to
give me something, so...

47:54.074 --> 47:56.209
they gave me Squillace.

47:58.612 --> 48:01.914
Be nice to him. Promise me?

48:01.982 --> 48:03.916
How nice?

48:04.018 --> 48:05.918
He is my younger brother.

48:06.019 --> 48:07.820
Yes.

48:07.888 --> 48:10.023
But how nice?

48:24.006 --> 48:25.573
That nice.

48:25.674 --> 48:28.109
I can be that nice.

48:28.177 --> 48:30.478
- You will?
- Yes.

49:08.252 --> 49:10.420
Good night, pages.

49:11.856 --> 49:14.657
Unless you would all join us?

49:14.725 --> 49:17.227
No.

49:17.328 --> 49:19.763
That is a step too far,

49:19.830 --> 49:23.433
even for the Duke
and Duchessa of Squillace.

49:36.715 --> 49:39.950
Now, my husband,

49:40.018 --> 49:42.320
are you ready?

50:04.942 --> 50:07.344
You will have
your war, Cardinal.

50:07.445 --> 50:09.780
But I will only ask
one thing of you.

50:09.848 --> 50:11.248
Please, my liege.

50:11.349 --> 50:13.618
No one will question

50:13.685 --> 50:16.721
the behaviour of my troops,

50:16.789 --> 50:20.859
my captains,
my generals, my arms.

50:24.331 --> 50:26.733
You will have your war...

50:28.836 --> 50:32.004
but it will be fought
the French way.
