What's up, Chief O'Hara?

03:15.324 --> 03:17.791
We've searched that hall
from cellar to weathervane.

03:17.793 --> 03:18.725
Not a trace of The Bookworm.

03:19.327 --> 03:22.494
- But how can that be?
- Oh, worse news, too, Batman.

03:22.496 --> 03:24.263
You know that alley way
where you said

03:24.265 --> 03:25.297
we'd find The Boy Wonder?

03:25.299 --> 03:29.134
- A-guarding Bookworm's ma?
- Yes. Yes.

03:29.136 --> 03:32.770
- Don't tell me!
- You guessed it.

03:32.772 --> 03:33.837
Great heavens!

03:33.839 --> 03:35.905
I better try to contact
Robin instantly

03:35.907 --> 03:38.007
on the utility belt wavelength.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.408
Robin.

03:39.410 --> 03:42.277
Robin? Do you receive me?

03:42.279 --> 03:44.812
Robin! Over.

03:46.281 --> 03:47.914
The tricky devils.

03:47.916 --> 03:50.283
They've turned the tables
and caught Robin.

03:50.285 --> 03:53.085
I'll call headquarters.
Throw out the drag net.

03:53.087 --> 03:55.287
No, wait a minute,
Chief O'Hara.

03:55.289 --> 03:59.324
Let me...turn my memory back.

04:02.161 --> 04:05.763
"He strikes at midnight.."

04:05.765 --> 04:06.296
...she said.

04:06.298 --> 04:09.165
But we know the Bookworm's
changed his plan.

04:09.167 --> 04:10.032
Don't interrupt!

04:10.034 --> 04:12.701
I'm trying to fathom
the sub-conscience

04:12.703 --> 04:14.969
of a deadly criminal!

04:15.737 --> 04:20.072
"He strikes at midnight."

04:22.142 --> 04:23.809
A metaphor..

04:23.811 --> 04:26.144
...suggests a clock.

04:26.146 --> 04:27.912
A clock called He?

04:27.914 --> 04:28.712
Of course!

04:28.714 --> 04:34.818
And there's only one clock in
Gotham City that is called He.

04:35.186 --> 04:37.754
Saints alive! Big Benjamin.

04:37.756 --> 04:40.289
In the Wayne Memorial
clock tower.

04:40.291 --> 04:42.524
And it fits in with the plan.

04:42.526 --> 04:45.627
"Do not ask for whom
the bell tolls.

04:45.629 --> 04:47.695
It tolls for thee."

04:47.697 --> 04:49.096
You mean?

04:49.098 --> 04:50.097
Exactly!

04:50.099 --> 04:52.232
And if my surmise is correct..

04:52.234 --> 04:56.002
...the ghastly fate that
Bookworm planned for me

04:56.004 --> 04:57.036
he's twisted to Robin.

04:57.038 --> 05:02.641
Chief O'Hara, we haven't
one Big Benjamin second to lose!

05:30.067 --> 05:32.968
Mere seconds
before he strikes.

05:32.970 --> 05:35.570
I'll shoot out the works.

05:41.276 --> 05:44.278
Ah, didn't even dent it.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.013
No time for a Bat-climb.

05:46.015 --> 05:48.281
We have one last
desperate chance.

05:48.283 --> 05:51.183
Help me setup
the Bat-zooka.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.222
The lightning rod on top.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.890
Fire!

06:03.061 --> 06:04.995
Bullseye.

06:05.196 --> 06:09.199
Second shot, the hands
of that clock.

06:09.201 --> 06:10.833
Fire!

06:15.939 --> 06:16.972
Mother McRee. Done it again.

06:16.974 --> 06:21.710
Quickly. Now, to get the ends
of these two conductive lines.

06:29.985 --> 06:31.151
What are you doing, Batman?

06:31.153 --> 06:33.653
Attaching these lines
to the nuclear power source.

06:33.655 --> 06:35.821
Both lines to
the positive terminal.

06:35.823 --> 06:37.189
As you may recall
from school

06:37.191 --> 06:41.226
like charges of electricity
repel each other.

06:43.829 --> 06:47.731
Now, to rev up
the power turbines.

06:47.733 --> 06:50.133
I still don't
get it, Batman.

06:50.135 --> 06:53.669
Pray! Pray, Chief O'Hara..

06:53.671 --> 06:57.839
...that the clapper and the bell
will be positively charged.

06:57.841 --> 07:00.274
And thus repel each other!

07:00.276 --> 07:03.410
I hope so, Batman.
I hope so!

07:21.828 --> 07:25.964
Funny, all I hear
is a nightingale.

07:36.007 --> 07:37.707
Inconceivable, but true.

07:37.709 --> 07:42.011
The precocious pest
has escaped us.

07:42.013 --> 07:43.379
But how could he, Bookworm?

07:43.381 --> 07:45.214
- How could he?
- How could he?

07:45.216 --> 07:48.217
I can not conceive,
but from Gill Blas

07:48.219 --> 07:51.453
translated by Tobias Smollett
book 10, chapter three..

07:51.455 --> 07:57.759
...quote "Facts are
stubborn things." Unquote.

07:57.761 --> 07:58.993
Now the fact is..

07:58.995 --> 08:02.896
...that our bats
have flown the belfry

08:02.898 --> 08:05.164
unaccountably still squeaking.

08:05.166 --> 08:09.468
Gee. And us, with our
super-crime not pulled yet.

08:11.104 --> 08:14.772
Ha!

08:17.776 --> 08:21.144
Do not fret, my sweet Lydia.
Oh, do not fret.

08:21.146 --> 08:26.349
My brain drenched mind
has done it again.

08:26.351 --> 08:29.118
A most delicious Bat-trap.

08:31.722 --> 08:33.154
Mwah!

08:35.022 --> 08:39.892
<i> And in Wayne Manor, stately</i>

08:49.301 --> 08:52.268
It's a gentleman from
the book mobile service, madam.

08:52.270 --> 08:56.205
Oh, how nice?
Bring him in.

08:56.207 --> 08:58.106
This way, sir.

09:01.877 --> 09:03.210
How do you do?

09:03.212 --> 09:05.145
What do you recommend
this week?

09:05.147 --> 09:08.781
Something for reading
before going to sleep.

09:08.783 --> 09:11.350
Oh, well, I believe you
will find this volume

09:11.352 --> 09:14.152
extremely effective,
Mrs. Cooper.

09:16.888 --> 09:20.523
Congressional record,
March 1919?

09:20.525 --> 09:23.759
Oh, it's the illustrations,
Mrs. Cooper.

09:23.761 --> 09:25.861
They are so <i> picante.</i>

09:25.863 --> 09:29.231
Oh, you don't say.

09:29.233 --> 09:31.533
Look, Alfred.

09:43.878 --> 09:45.445
Hmm..

09:47.915 --> 09:48.447
Oh.

09:59.258 --> 10:00.992
Subject found
to be member of..

10:02.161 --> 10:02.993
Yes, Commissioner?

10:02.995 --> 10:06.096
Uh, Bookworm has struck
again, Batman. Brazenly.

10:06.098 --> 10:06.496
'Where?'

10:06.498 --> 10:08.631
The mansion of millionaire,
Bruce Wayne.

10:08.633 --> 10:09.932
He stole a single volume.

10:09.934 --> 10:12.567
A priceless
first edition cookbook.

10:12.569 --> 10:15.403
Well, is anyone in
the Wayne household hurt?

10:15.405 --> 10:16.337
Fortunately, no one.

10:16.339 --> 10:18.672
Goodbye, Commissioner,
I'll be at Wayne Manor

10:18.674 --> 10:20.306
faster than anyone can imagine.

10:20.308 --> 10:23.008
- That's not the only thing.
- 'What else?'

10:23.010 --> 10:25.477
In the middle of the street
at Cedar and Fifth

10:25.479 --> 10:27.645
there's been a sudden
monstrous apparition.

10:27.647 --> 10:31.582
'The biggest cookbook
anyone ever saw.'

10:31.584 --> 10:32.482
Goodbye, commissioner.

10:32.784 --> 10:36.318
- Aunt Harriet and Alfred?
- They're not hurt, he said.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.921
Our duty is to
the public. Let's go!

10:44.060 --> 10:45.692
What a twisted
scale of events.

10:45.694 --> 10:50.663
Typical...of the frustrated
author Bookworm is.

10:50.665 --> 10:51.530
Over plotting.

10:51.532 --> 10:54.232
'Either the robbery
or a giant cookbook'

10:54.234 --> 10:57.068
would have attracted
our attention.

10:57.070 --> 10:59.403
Foolish amateur.

10:59.405 --> 11:01.338
Has to try both.

11:18.154 --> 11:20.655
Holy toad!

11:20.657 --> 11:22.723
Back, everybody!

11:23.958 --> 11:25.224
Back! Back!

11:25.226 --> 11:26.992
Take cover at the side streets.

11:26.994 --> 11:29.260
Take cover at the side streets!

11:29.262 --> 11:33.430
The recipes in this book
could be explosive.

11:33.432 --> 11:35.231
Stay back.

11:35.432 --> 11:36.965
I bet it's hollow
inside, Batman.

11:36.967 --> 11:41.235
We'll soon find out. Let's probe
it with our high energy radar.

11:41.237 --> 11:42.636
Roger!

11:47.675 --> 11:49.007
'Hollow, alright.'

11:49.009 --> 11:51.275
Yes. Judging from
the rate of reflection

11:51.277 --> 11:53.310
the cover contains
high tensile steel.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.445
- Let's open it up, Batman.
- Right you are.

11:55.447 --> 11:59.315
If the cover contains steel we
can do it from a safe distance

11:59.317 --> 12:01.717
using the super powered
Bat-magnet.

12:01.719 --> 12:03.418
Great.

12:06.255 --> 12:09.557
- I'll work the power supply.
- Roger.

12:13.094 --> 12:16.128
Bat-pull, 1200 pounds.

12:18.331 --> 12:20.231
Make it a ton.

12:32.611 --> 12:36.013
Oh, poor puny little bat-brains.

12:36.015 --> 12:38.682
I bet they think
they opened that book.

12:38.684 --> 12:40.316
But will they go in?

12:40.318 --> 12:42.484
Of course, they'll go in.

12:42.486 --> 12:45.320
In the words of the poet..

12:45.322 --> 12:49.524
"Curiosity killed the bat."

13:02.371 --> 13:04.372
Ordinary paper.

13:04.506 --> 13:06.707
It must cover
the hollowed out part.

13:06.709 --> 13:09.042
I wonder what's
on the menu inside.

13:09.044 --> 13:11.477
Only one way
to find out, Robin.

13:11.479 --> 13:14.179
Let's take a bite.

13:43.874 --> 13:45.975
Smells like soup.

13:45.977 --> 13:47.910
Darn good soup.

13:47.912 --> 13:49.344
Right you are.

13:49.346 --> 13:50.978
Bat-soup.

13:50.980 --> 13:54.114
'And in you go.'

13:58.419 --> 13:59.952
Holy stew pot!

13:59.954 --> 14:02.120
'Bookworm to Batman.'

14:02.122 --> 14:03.621
He's got this place wired.

14:03.623 --> 14:06.156
I'll bet he's watching
and listening, too.

14:06.158 --> 14:07.290
Well, of course,
I'm listening.

14:07.292 --> 14:10.026
'Bookworm, what are you up to?'

14:10.028 --> 14:12.128
It's a curious old recipe
I discovered

14:12.130 --> 14:17.366
in the alchemist cookbook,
Vienna, dated 1534.

14:17.368 --> 14:20.469
'How to steam a bat.'

14:21.204 --> 14:22.370
I think he means it.

14:22.372 --> 14:24.572
'Of course, I mean it,
Boy Wonder.'

14:24.574 --> 14:32.012
'Watch now, while I turn up my
radio controlled double boiler.'

14:34.682 --> 14:36.949
Double for Dynamic Duo.

14:36.951 --> 14:38.517
'Cook well, my bat-eared
friends.

14:38.519 --> 14:41.052
'While you are stewing down,
I shall be pulling off'

14:41.054 --> 14:45.356
'the crime of the century with
the aid of your Bat-mobile.'

14:45.358 --> 14:48.292
Happy juices.

14:48.294 --> 14:50.594
Quick, let's fly.

14:51.128 --> 14:54.964
Batman to Gotham City police.
Batman to Gotham City police.

14:54.966 --> 14:59.501
Red alert. Red alert.
We're trapped inside a cookbook

14:59.503 --> 15:02.437
at Fifth and Cedar. Red alert.

15:02.439 --> 15:05.139
Do you receive me? Over.

15:05.141 --> 15:07.207
No answer.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.075
These high tensile
steel walls

15:09.077 --> 15:10.342
they're cutting down
our transmission.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.043
I'll get out
my laser beam cutting torch.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.246
Don't, Robin. No, no.
It would super heat the steam

15:15.248 --> 15:17.648
and boil us
in a split second.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.615
Holy pressure cooker!

15:18.617 --> 15:21.451
Only way to crack this thing
would be the Bat-beam

15:21.453 --> 15:24.987
in the Bat-mobile
and Bookworm has it.

15:24.989 --> 15:28.323
We even left
the engine running.

15:32.593 --> 15:37.196
'With all your might
and mane, men. Let's go!'

15:48.941 --> 15:51.142
They'll never
get to us in time.

15:51.144 --> 15:53.611
There's only one hope.

15:56.347 --> 15:58.748
- Well?
- We're getting nowhere, Chief.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.783
Oh, harder,
fellas. Harder!

16:00.785 --> 16:02.985
Oh, give me, give me
that sledge, here.

16:02.987 --> 16:05.654
Sounds like steam in there.

16:06.856 --> 16:09.591
Drats ! That fine pair
of crime fighters

16:09.593 --> 16:12.594
boiled in the entrails
of a monster cookbook.

16:12.596 --> 16:16.164
Who could imagine
a more tragic end?

16:17.199 --> 16:18.699
Batman to Bat-cave.

16:18.701 --> 16:20.167
What's the use, Batman?

16:20.169 --> 16:23.003
It's just possible our own
supersensitive antenna

16:23.005 --> 16:26.806
may pick up the signal where
the police receivers could not.

16:26.808 --> 16:27.840
Do you think Alfred's there?

16:27.842 --> 16:29.942
He's a creature of well
disciplined habits.

16:29.944 --> 16:32.644
It's his regular time
for dusting the Atomic Pyle.

16:32.646 --> 16:37.015
Batman to Alfred. Batman
to Alfred. This is an emergency.

16:42.187 --> 16:45.022
Might I be
of some assistance, sir?

16:45.790 --> 16:48.792
Quick, Alfred. Point me
into the voice actuated circuit

16:48.794 --> 16:50.393
of the master
anti-crime computer.

16:50.395 --> 16:53.295
Certainly, sir.
At once, sir.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.840
Bookworm to Bookmobile.

17:06.843 --> 17:10.044
Bookworm to Bookmobile.
Do you read me?

17:10.046 --> 17:12.012
'Devil to Bookworm.
I read you.'

17:12.013 --> 17:16.983
Rendezvous. The rear
of the Morgan Bilt library.

17:16.984 --> 17:19.417
Over and out.

17:21.154 --> 17:23.054
The Morgan Bilt Library?

17:23.056 --> 17:24.021
But that's uncrackable.

17:24.022 --> 17:26.690
It's defied every burglar
in the country.

17:26.692 --> 17:29.325
Yes. Yes, yes,
my sweet Lydia. Yes.

17:29.327 --> 17:32.928
But they did not have
the use of the Bat-beam.

17:32.930 --> 17:36.331
Plans and views. Folio, 369.

17:36.333 --> 17:40.001
Operate, cross-read.

17:47.909 --> 17:49.843
I'm weakening, Batman.

17:49.845 --> 17:52.145
Hold on, Robin.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.249
Hold on, hold on, I'm getting
the answer I expected.

17:56.251 --> 17:56.983
Answer?

17:56.985 --> 17:59.118
About the source
of the steam.

17:59.120 --> 18:04.890
Plans and views, cutout,
feedback circuit three, operate.

18:08.361 --> 18:11.062
Who's the best
safe cracker in our files?

18:11.064 --> 18:12.096
Uh, The Riddler.

18:12.098 --> 18:14.364
Well, send a helicopter
to state penitentiary

18:14.366 --> 18:15.264
and have him brought here.

18:15.266 --> 18:17.366
- Yes..
- Alright, everybody down!

18:17.368 --> 18:20.001
Go on! Get them down!

18:21.003 --> 18:23.170
Ready? Fire!

18:34.580 --> 18:36.614
Good grief!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.749
We're too late.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.983
Gone!

18:39.985 --> 18:41.217
Consumed, I fear.

18:41.219 --> 18:46.455
Totally consumed in this
diabolical hell's kitchen.

18:51.428 --> 18:52.694
<i> The Morgan Bilt Library.</i>

18:52.696 --> 18:56.364
<i> Unparalleled repository</i>
<i> of literary treasures.</i>

18:56.366 --> 19:02.370
<i> In an alley at the rear, there</i>
<i> are little foxes in the vines.</i>

19:02.372 --> 19:06.807
Directly ahead through that
wall, the air conditioned vault

19:06.809 --> 19:09.509
containing treasures
beyond imagination.

19:09.511 --> 19:11.844
Oh, some hall, alright.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.745
Seven Gutenberg Bibles.

19:13.747 --> 19:17.882
Eleven First Folio's
by William Shakespeare

19:17.884 --> 19:19.083
Some wall, too.

19:19.085 --> 19:22.553
Three feet of cement
over 18 inches of steel.

19:22.555 --> 19:25.088
Ah, to the Bat-beam.

19:27.824 --> 19:30.192
But what if something
goes wrong, Bookworm?

19:30.194 --> 19:32.861
Oh, it won't,
it won't. It won't.

19:32.863 --> 19:36.064
"Best laid plans
of mice and men."

19:36.066 --> 19:40.101
I don't know where it's from.
But I know it's true.

19:40.103 --> 19:42.436
Schemes. Schemes. Schemes.

19:42.438 --> 19:44.004
"The best laid scheme.."

19:44.006 --> 19:48.408
Robert Burns, "To a mouse",
stanza seven. Schemes.

19:49.410 --> 19:52.979
You are graded C minus.

19:54.148 --> 19:57.250
Now, for the Bat-beam.

20:08.862 --> 20:10.895
Oh! Melting.

20:10.897 --> 20:12.730
Fantastic.

20:12.732 --> 20:16.967
My fine twisty
worms, follow me.

20:21.405 --> 20:22.438
They'll follow you, Bookworm.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.774
Right back into the woodwork
of the prison carpenter shop.

20:25.776 --> 20:28.443
- Impossible.
- How did they escape?

20:28.445 --> 20:30.378
Thought you
had us cooked, huh?

20:30.380 --> 20:33.047
We escaped through
the manhole under your stove.

20:33.049 --> 20:36.116
the one you used to introduce
your murderous steam pipe.

20:36.118 --> 20:37.450
It's an old mistake, Bookworm.

20:37.452 --> 20:41.187
'Armoring the walls but leaving
the floor unprotected.'

20:41.189 --> 20:43.355
How did they discover
our objective?

20:43.357 --> 20:46.491
Your talk in the Bat-mobile was
picked up by a secret mic.

20:46.493 --> 20:49.127
It was relayed to us via
the automatic feedback circuit

20:49.129 --> 20:49.660
in our Bat-cave.

20:50.362 --> 20:53.996
- Let's clean house, Batman.
- Now, Robin.

20:57.467 --> 21:00.068
Glasses off.

21:01.336 --> 21:05.038
Alright. my fine twisty worms.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.073
Attack!

21:21.854 --> 21:23.988
Ho!

21:57.454 --> 22:00.055
You should've learned
much sooner, Miss Limpet.

22:00.057 --> 22:03.558
The oldest plot,
and still the best.

22:03.860 --> 22:06.361
Crime..

22:06.363 --> 22:08.429
...does not pay.

22:13.301 --> 22:17.737
A check for $5000 for
the state prison library.

22:17.739 --> 22:19.338
This is very generous
of you, Bruce.

22:19.340 --> 22:22.374
I thought it was the least
I could do after reading

22:22.376 --> 22:25.343
about that dreadful
business in the papers.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.244
Uh, The Bookworm affair?

22:27.246 --> 22:29.713
And I feel our prison
libraries could use

22:29.715 --> 22:31.381
some new uplifting titles.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.249
Yes. Yeah, shocking.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.284
A man of Bookworm's education.

22:35.286 --> 22:39.554
How could such a fellow
turn to a life of crime?

22:40.155 --> 22:42.389
I'd say it's an example
of the old precept.

22:42.391 --> 22:45.191
"A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing."

22:45.193 --> 22:47.193
A wise observation, Bruce.

22:47.195 --> 22:48.127
I'll remember that.

22:48.129 --> 22:50.929
- Uh, would you like to see him?
- Bookworm?

22:50.931 --> 22:53.164
He's just outside waiting
conveyance to the penitentiary.

22:53.166 --> 22:57.201
Gosh, Bruce, I'd sure like to
see a real crook in the flesh.

22:57.203 --> 22:59.469
Well, I don't see
any harm in it, Dick.

22:59.471 --> 23:02.071
As long as he's under
sound restraint.

23:02.073 --> 23:05.374
- Get them, Chief O'Hara.
- Yes, sir.

23:06.309 --> 23:06.941
Them?

23:06.943 --> 23:09.843
His female accomplice, too.
A Miss Limpet.

23:09.845 --> 23:11.444
Very sad case, that one.

23:11.446 --> 23:15.915
Alright, bring 'em in.
Come on, boys.

23:20.220 --> 23:22.287
Alright, you crooks,
and remember

23:22.289 --> 23:25.323
be polite
to Mr. Bruce Wayne, too.

23:28.627 --> 23:33.230
"The world's
100 greatest crimes."

23:33.232 --> 23:35.365
You abandoned child.

23:35.367 --> 23:37.166
'Is there no hope for you?'

23:37.168 --> 23:42.404
'As you can see, Bruce,
your gift was sorely needed.'

23:42.406 --> 23:45.306
May I keep that
as a souvenir, Commissioner?

23:45.308 --> 23:48.442
- Oh, yes, certainly.
- 'Thank you.'

23:49.911 --> 23:51.144
What are you
smiling at, Bookworm?

23:51.146 --> 23:55.581
Oh, I'm so much cleverer than
all of you, you see.

23:55.583 --> 23:56.481
Oh, as the poet says

23:56.483 --> 24:00.885
"They who loose today
may win tomorrow."

24:00.887 --> 24:02.653
Wrong, Bookworm.

24:02.955 --> 24:04.120
Not the poet.

24:04.122 --> 24:07.123
That line's from
Cervantes "Don Quixote".

24:07.125 --> 24:10.159
Part one, book one,
chapter seven.

24:10.161 --> 24:11.994
Poof! That devil.

24:11.996 --> 24:16.164
This fellow, he is almost
as obnoxious as Batman.

24:16.166 --> 24:20.234
Alright, alright,
out, out out. Come on!

24:22.005 --> 24:25.907
