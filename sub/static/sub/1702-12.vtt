WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:04.753
Okay. Hey.

00:04.921 --> 00:06.964
- Does everybody hate these shoes?
- Oh, yeah.

00:07.132 --> 00:12.011
But I don't think anybody's gonna focus on
that as long as you wear that towel dress.

00:12.929 --> 00:13.971
Tell him.

00:14.139 --> 00:18.350
It's her first day at this new job.
You're not supposed to start with her.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.854
All right. I suppose I can wait a day.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.815
- Hey, what are you doing Friday?
- Why?

00:24.983 --> 00:28.152
I need you to come to this bachelor party
for my weird cousin Albert.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.820
You know, he's the botanist?

00:29.988 --> 00:33.449
Oh, God. Yeah, botanists are such geeks.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.284
Yeah.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.493
Is that a dinosaur tie?

00:36.703 --> 00:37.745
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.709
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.962
Hey. Rach, I'm here with the purses.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.966
It must take you forever
to find your keys.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.468
Thank you, thank you, Pheebs.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.471
Oh, you're welcome.
Oh, please want the one with the turtles.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.432
No, no, no, turtles scare me.
I don't need that today.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.436
Honey, just relax. It's gonna be fine.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.230
Hey, why don't I come down there
and take you to lunch?

01:05.397 --> 01:08.025
Aw, honey, thank you,
but Mark's taking me out.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.071
Mark? Is that the same Mark
that helped you get the job?

01:12.238 --> 01:15.699
Yeah. It's kind of like a
"good luck on your first day" sort of thing.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.201
Is this actually a lunch box?

01:17.410 --> 01:20.662
Um, no, it's a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.122
Oh.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.751
- Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
- What?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.545
Oh, yeah, I think so.
Why am I invited to this again?

01:28.713 --> 01:30.464
- Apparently, Albert has no friends.
- Oh.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.424
He's excited about the bachelor party,
though.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.427
I think the only reason he's getting married
is so he can see a stripper.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.308
A stripper at a bachelor party.
That is so cliché.

01:41.476 --> 01:44.186
Why don't you guys get a magician?

01:44.896 --> 01:48.732
If a magician can open my beer
with his butt cheeks, then all right.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.200
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?

02:40.410 --> 02:43.203
You should've seen the hug he gave her
when she got the job.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.081
And he's really good-looking.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.002
- What am I gonna do?
- You don't do anything.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.796
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.

02:54.465 --> 02:55.716
Don't cry out loud.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.511
Yes! Unh!

02:59.679 --> 03:02.014
Guess who has an audition
for a Broadway musical.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.726
I wanna say you,
but it seems like such an easy answer.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.269
It is me.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.230
It's a musical version
of A Tale of Two Cities.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.691
So I think I'm gonna sing
"New York, New York"...

03:12.859 --> 03:16.778
...and, uh, oh,
"I Left My Heart in San Francisco."

03:19.157 --> 03:23.202
Uh, Joey, I don't think
you get to pick the cities.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.080
- What?
- Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.250
Who?

03:31.377 --> 03:33.337
I'll get you the CliffsNotes.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.297
The what?

03:35.798 --> 03:36.924
The abridgment.

03:37.091 --> 03:40.135
Oh, okay. Ha, ha.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.304
The what?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.560
Then the style number...

03:48.728 --> 03:52.773
...the invoice number,
and the shipping date.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.900
Good. Any questions so far?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.319
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?

03:57.487 --> 04:02.032
- Ha, ha. Twenty percent.
- Oh. I love this job. Ha, ha.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.160
- Ah! My first call.
- Here, let me.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.037
Okay.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.207
- Rachel Green's line. How may I help you?
- Hi, is Rachel there?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.335
- And who may I say is calling?
- This is Ross.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.544
Ross of?

04:15.338 --> 04:18.089
Of "Ross and Rachel."

04:18.257 --> 04:20.384
Oh. Hi, it's Mark.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.594
- Oh, hey, Mark. Heh. Hey.
- Hey.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.096
- Hey, hold on a second.
- Uh, okay.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.430
- It's Ross.
- Okay.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.891
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.686
What's Mark doing
answering your phone?

04:30.853 --> 04:32.688
Oh, he's just goofing around.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.774
Oh, that's funny.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.070
Why isn't he goofing around
in his own office?

04:40.238 --> 04:44.324
Ha, ha. Honey, this is his office too.
I told you, we're Joanna's two assistants.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.743
Why does Joanna need two assistants?

04:46.911 --> 04:49.204
How lazy is she?

04:50.081 --> 04:52.416
- Oh. Oh, my God. What did I just do?
- What?

04:52.583 --> 04:54.710
I think I just shipped 3000 bras
to Personnel.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.712
Honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.131
Okay. Bye-bye.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.758
Ow! Ross!

05:01.926 --> 05:04.428
Huh? Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was just trying to...

05:04.595 --> 05:07.472
Uh, I was dialing another number.

05:20.528 --> 05:24.281
All right, I just got changed in 30 seconds
so you could be alone with him.

05:24.449 --> 05:28.076
- You better go for it.
- Please. I'm not going for anything.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.621
- Well, if you don't, I will.
- Would you please go?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.041
Night, Mon.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.502
- Night, Julio.
- Adiós.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.807
Look, Julio,
someone left their book here.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.726
Actually, that is mine.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.227
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.812
What are you reading?

05:55.980 --> 05:59.524
Flowers of Evil by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?

05:59.692 --> 06:02.444
Ha, ha. Have I read it?

06:03.654 --> 06:05.864
No. Are you enjoying it?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.951
I thought that I would,
but the translation's no good.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.080
You're a poet and you don't know it.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.212
Actually, I, uh... I am a poet.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.631
Oh. Ha, ha.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.883
So you do know it. Ha, ha.

06:28.971 --> 06:33.350
Ahem. So, uh, what kind of things
do you write about?

06:33.518 --> 06:35.727
Things that move me.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.938
The shadow of a tree...

06:38.940 --> 06:40.232
...a child laughing...

06:42.193 --> 06:43.360
...or this lip.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.529
Mine?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.656
Right here?

06:48.950 --> 06:53.453
I could write an epic poem about this lip.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.128
How would that go?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.141
Well, it didn't rhyme, ha, ha...

07:14.308 --> 07:15.392
...but I liked it.

07:18.229 --> 07:24.025
You've got to pick a pocket or two, boys

07:24.235 --> 07:31.199
You've got to pick a pocket or two

07:34.704 --> 07:37.456
Lovely. Just lovely.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.249
Really? Thanks.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.919
Listen, Joey, we definitely wanna see you
for the callback on Saturday.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.379
Excellent.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.339
- I'll be there.
- Ha, ha. Okay.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.926
And listen, don't forget to bring
your jazz shoes for the dance audition.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.434
Uh, my agent said
that it wasn't a dancing part.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.479
Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.
Ha, ha.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.815
But believe me, with your
dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.277
Three years of modern dance
with Twyla Tharp?

08:08.321 --> 08:11.239
Five years with
the American Ballet Theatre?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.703
Hey, everybody lies
on their résumé, okay?

08:16.871 --> 08:19.581
I wasn't one of the Zoom kids either.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.626
Well, can you, like, dance at all?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.253
Yeah, I can dance. You know:

08:33.679 --> 08:36.306
Oh, no, no, no.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.017
What is that?

08:39.184 --> 08:42.354
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.483
All right, I have to get that. But no, no.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.319
Hello?

08:49.487 --> 08:51.655
Hi. Ha, ha.

08:51.822 --> 08:56.910
Yeah, listen, I'm in need of a stripper,
and I was told that you do that.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.875
Let me ask you this.
What do you do for the extra hundred?

09:05.336 --> 09:09.005
So would I have to provide the grapes?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.174
- Hi.
- Ooh.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.260
How was last night with Julio, señorita?
Ha, ha.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.886
It was so amazing.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.139
He's so sexy and smart,
which makes him even sexier.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.892
Oh, my gosh.
Last night we were fooling around...

09:21.060 --> 09:24.104
...and all of a sudden he stops
to write a poem.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.857
Get out.
I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.

09:29.569 --> 09:34.906
Okay, we have our stripper,
a Miss Crystal Chandelier.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.535
Well, sure. You name a kid that,
what do you expect them to grow up to be?

09:40.246 --> 09:43.665
Ahem. Anyway, when he left
he forgot to take the poem with him.

09:43.833 --> 09:48.420
Now, I am totally dense about poetry,
but I think this is pretty good, all right?

09:48.588 --> 09:51.339
Check it out. Read it.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.842
"The Empty Vase."

09:54.010 --> 09:55.176
Translucent beauty...

09:55.344 --> 09:57.178
To yourself.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.893
- Hey, you know, that's pretty good.
- Yeah, I think so too. Phoebe?

10:04.061 --> 10:06.563
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, great. I'm so glad you guys like it.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.774
- Yay. All right, I gotta go to work.
- No, no. I'm not done.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.652
Give it back when you're through.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.446
- Okay, see you guys.
- Bye-bye.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.947
Bye.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.450
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Poor Monica.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.910
- What? What? What?
- What?

10:21.078 --> 10:23.496
He was with her
when he wrote this poem. Look.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.499
My vessel so lovely
With nothing inside

10:26.667 --> 10:29.586
Now that I've touched you
You seem emptier still

10:29.754 --> 10:32.672
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.217
- You really think that's what he meant?
- Totally.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.137
Oh, God.
Oh, and she seems so happy too.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.181
Done.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.027
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?

10:54.195 --> 10:56.946
Oh, yeah, sure. It's, uh right...

11:01.827 --> 11:03.286
What's that?

11:03.454 --> 11:05.747
Uh, it's from Ross. It's a love bug.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.460
Wow. Somebody wants people to know
you have a boyfriend.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.630
Oh, no. No, no, no.
That's not what he's doing.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.675
- He's just really romantic.
- Okay.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.135
Excuse me. Are you Rachel Green?

11:19.303 --> 11:20.512
Yes, I am.

11:21.889 --> 11:22.972
One, two, three.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.183
Congratulations on your first week

11:25.351 --> 11:26.810
At your brand-new job

11:26.977 --> 11:28.770
It won't be long
Before you're the boss

11:30.189 --> 11:32.899
And you know who will be there
To support you

11:33.067 --> 11:34.484
Your one and only boyfriend

11:34.652 --> 11:36.277
It's nice to have a boyfriend.

11:36.445 --> 11:40.323
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross
Ross!

11:46.080 --> 11:48.790
I'm hurt. I'm actually hurt...

11:48.958 --> 11:53.002
...that you'd think I'd send you those things
out of anything other than love.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.796
Hurt.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.258
- Hurt.
- All right, Ross, I get it. You're hurt.

11:58.426 --> 12:03.763
Can't a guy send a barbershop quartet
to his girlfriend's office anymore?

12:05.266 --> 12:07.934
Oh, please. Ross, it was so obvious.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.103
It was like you were marking
your territory.

12:10.271 --> 12:14.858
I mean, you might as well have just come in
and peed all around my desk.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.445
I would never do that.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.032
Look, I know
what's going on here, okay?

12:23.200 --> 12:27.495
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.

12:27.663 --> 12:31.499
Yeah, well, if Mark said that,
then Mark's an idiot.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.001
Mark's a genius.

12:33.169 --> 12:37.130
- Why? How? How is he a genius?
- Look, don't you see what's happening?

12:37.298 --> 12:40.425
Instead of hitting on her right away,
he's becoming her confidant.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.053
Now he's gonna be the guy that she goes to
to complain about you.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.430
What am I gonna do?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.557
Well, why don't you send her
a musical bug?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.976
Oh, no, you already did that.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.981
All right, look, you're gonna have to
go there yourself now, okay?

12:55.149 --> 12:57.776
- Make a few surprise visits.
- I don't know, you guys.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.445
Fine, don't do anything.
Just sit here and talk to us.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.949
Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you.
And he's being Mr. Joe-Sensitive.

13:05.117 --> 13:09.287
She starts thinking, "Maybe this is the guy
for me because he understands me."

13:09.455 --> 13:11.456
And before you know it, she's with him.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.459
And you'll be all, "Oh, man."

13:14.960 --> 13:16.795
And he'll be all, "Yes!"

13:19.006 --> 13:21.633
And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude."

13:23.636 --> 13:26.012
And pretty soon you'll be like:

13:26.180 --> 13:28.264
"Hi."

13:29.099 --> 13:34.229
And, "Well, I can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there."

13:34.647 --> 13:38.149
And we'll be like,
"Man, get over it. It's been four years."

13:40.611 --> 13:43.279
He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?

13:46.283 --> 13:48.618
Here's the Shelli Segal stuff
for December.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.788
- Oh, wait, I've got something for you.
- What? Oh... Mark.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.832
It's okay. Rachel knows.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.167
Yeah, but even so... Ha, ha.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.546
I can't help it. I'm just crazy about you.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.799
Oh, that is so sweet.

14:03.759 --> 14:04.801
Okay, okay.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.720
I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today,
but it's just so tough.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.057
I see you walking around,
and I just wanna touch and hold you.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.018
- Aw.
- Come on, no one's around. Just kiss me.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.856
- All right, that's it. Get off. Get off of her.
- What is going on?

14:18.023 --> 14:20.817
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.861
Ross.

14:27.408 --> 14:31.953
I have been down in your store
for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.791
What do I have to do
to get some service?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.420
Hi, Rach.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.847
Uh, Joey? Joey Tribbiani?

14:56.312 --> 15:00.023
Listen, Joey, I got a problem.
I just got a call from my dance captain.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.359
He's having a relationship crisis
and can't get out of Long Island.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.653
So does that mean the audition's off?

15:05.821 --> 15:09.407
Listen, Joey,
seeing as you've got the most experience...

15:09.575 --> 15:13.161
...I want you to take these dancers
and teach them the combination.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.705
What?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.248
Oh, Joey, come on, it's easy.

15:17.416 --> 15:22.086
You know, it's hand, hand, head, head...

15:22.254 --> 15:24.088
...up, pas de bourrée, pas de bourrée...

15:24.256 --> 15:26.883
...big turn here, rond de jambe,
sissonne, sissonne...

15:27.051 --> 15:29.385
...slide, step, step...

15:29.553 --> 15:31.471
...and jazz hands.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.310
So that's steppity-step and jazz hands.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.479
Have fun.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.314
Bye.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.902
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.570
- What are you wrapping?
- Oh.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.156
Look what I got Julio.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.995
- Yeah, it's a vase.
- Yeah.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.538
Just like the one in the poem.

15:57.706 --> 16:01.000
Yeah, well,
not exactly like the one in the poem.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.585
What do you mean?

16:02.753 --> 16:05.463
Remember how you said
you were really dense about poetry?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.465
Yeah.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.592
Oh.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.516
- So I'm just an empty vase, huh?
- What?

16:16.684 --> 16:19.060
So I don't read as many important books
as you do.

16:19.228 --> 16:23.815
I don't write poems that seem to be about
one thing but are about something else.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.526
And you know what?
I get excited about stupid stuff...

16:26.694 --> 16:29.070
...like when my People magazine comes
on Saturday...

16:29.238 --> 16:31.948
...and the new Hold Everything catalog.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.700
But that does not mean I'm empty.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.452
I care about things.
I care about my friends and family.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.871
You have no right
to make that judgment about me.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.957
- You don't even know me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.251
The poem is not about you.

16:44.795 --> 16:48.381
- What?
- "The Empty Vase" is not about you.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.633
My baby preciosa.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.094
You make me so sad
that you would think this.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.976
- I'm sorry. It's... My friend Phoebe said...
- No, it's...

17:00.144 --> 17:02.228
It's about all women.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.150
Well, heh, all American women.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.403
You feel better now?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.031
Oh, yeah.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.201
All right, let's do it.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.056
No, no, no.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.141
What was that?

17:40.309 --> 17:42.894
I know,
it's the best I could get out of them.

17:44.438 --> 17:48.649
- Well, people.
- People, people, people.

17:48.817 --> 17:53.446
Let's try it again.
And this time, let's everybody watch Joey.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.200
Show them how it's done.

18:02.831 --> 18:03.873
Count it off, Mack.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.930
So did you have fun
at the bachelor party last night?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.598
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Look what I got.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.642
- See, she's fully dressed, right?
- Right.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.229
And then you click it and,
uh-oh, she's naked.

18:27.981 --> 18:30.691
And then you click it again
and she's dressed.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.277
She's a business woman,
walking down the street.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.030
She's window shopping,
and, oh, oh, oh, she's naked.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.705
Hi.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.999
Hello.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.920
You know what? I'm gonna spend
some alone time with the pen.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.057
I'm sorry. I was an idiot.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.435
- A big idiot.
- A big idiot. Heh.

19:07.521 --> 19:12.024
It's just, you have to realize,
this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.903
Honey, why is it hard?
We've been together for almost a year now.

19:16.989 --> 19:22.410
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years,
and I lost her.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.247
And now, if it's possible,
I think I love you even more.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.042
So it's hard for me to believe
I'm not gonna...

19:30.210 --> 19:34.088
Well, that someone else
isn't gonna take you away.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.258
Let it be me. Let it be me.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.224
Honey, that's very sweet.

19:45.434 --> 19:49.228
It just seems to me, though,
that if two people love each other...

19:49.396 --> 19:51.898
...and trust each other, like we do...

19:52.065 --> 19:54.275
...there's no reason to be jealous.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.660
I gotta get going. Bye, Chandler.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.870
Oh, okay, Ross.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.916
Listen, this pen's getting kind of boring,
so can you pick me up some porn?

20:12.961 --> 20:15.087
- Where you going?
- I've gotta go pick up Ben.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.923
We've got a playdate this afternoon.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.758
Oh. With who?

20:18.926 --> 20:21.594
Just this woman I met last night
at the party.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.429
There was a woman at?

20:25.807 --> 20:26.933
The stripper?

20:28.185 --> 20:29.602
Yeah.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.146
You have a playdate with a stripper?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.816
Man, I gotta get a kid.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.366
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.244
We started talking after she,
you know, did her thing...

20:46.411 --> 20:48.788
...and it turns out she's got a boy
about Ben's age.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.915
So we're gonna take the kids
to a Gymboree class.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.333
- Meh.
- Oh.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.710
- Is that okay?
- Sure. Is she married?

20:54.878 --> 20:57.380
- No.
- Huh.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.177
Are you jealous?

21:04.471 --> 21:08.224
No. You know, I just don't see why
she has to play with you, that's all.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.101
I mean, doesn't she, you know...

21:10.269 --> 21:13.813
...have any other stripper-mom friends
of her own?

21:17.025 --> 21:21.028
- You are totally jealous.
- Ugh. I'm not jealous, all right?

21:21.196 --> 21:23.531
This is about...

21:23.865 --> 21:27.952
...um, people feeling certain things...

21:28.120 --> 21:30.288
...you know, about...

21:30.455 --> 21:31.622
...strippers.
- Oh.

21:31.790 --> 21:35.793
- And, you know... And, um... I... Ugh.
- Honey, I love you too.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.421
- Bye.
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.047
What?

21:53.228 --> 21:56.272
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget
for a few hours, you know?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.732
- Yeah.
- Ha, ha.

21:57.899 --> 22:01.444
Either that or you just turned him on
and sent him off to a stripper.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.785
Is there a Julio here?

22:10.287 --> 22:11.329
I am Julio.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.832
Mr. Pretentious

22:15.459 --> 22:16.834
You think there's no one finer

22:17.044 --> 22:20.588
Well, your poems are unpublished
And you work in a diner

22:20.756 --> 22:26.093
You're no God's gift to women
That's all in your head

22:26.261 --> 22:27.428
You are just a butt-munch

22:27.596 --> 22:28.804
No one likes a butt-munch.

22:28.972 --> 22:32.266
And you're also bad in bed
