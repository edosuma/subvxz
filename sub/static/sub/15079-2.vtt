DONNIE,
I'M NOT KEEPING IT.

37:34.823 --> 37:37.656
I GAVE IT TO YOU.
IT'S YOURS.

KATE. KATE.

38:04.613 --> 38:06.315
I SCREWED THIS UP.

38:06.315 --> 38:09.718
I CHEATED, AND I LIED,

38:09.718 --> 38:13.792
AND I'M STILL NOT
BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

38:15.864 --> 38:17.726
I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS
TRANSFERRED BACK HERE,

38:17.726 --> 38:19.998
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

38:19.998 --> 38:22.000
I ASKED
FOR THIS TRANSFER...

38:24.002 --> 38:25.604
...BECAUSE I MISSED YOU.

38:29.938 --> 38:32.681
FILE THOSE IF YOU WANT.

YOU WON'T.

OH, HEY. HEY.
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.402
I KNOW.

38:53.402 --> 38:55.364
I-I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER
THAT WE TALK IN PERSON.

38:55.364 --> 38:57.636
WELL, LOOK --
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

38:57.636 --> 38:59.337
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SAY TO YOU.

38:59.337 --> 39:04.643
I, UH...I HAVEN'T BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.375
I AM OFF MY MEDS.

39:06.375 --> 39:08.046
I-I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU SOONER.
I'M SORRY.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.748
DANIEL,
I ALREADY KNEW.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.349
YOU DID?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.781
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO EAVESDROP,

39:12.781 --> 39:14.783
BUT I HEARD YOU IN YOUR OFFICE
TALKING TO NATALIE.

39:14.783 --> 39:16.555
OH, THAT --
THAT DOESN'T MEAN --

39:16.555 --> 39:18.387
I HEARD YOU SAY
THAT YOU LOVED HER.

39:18.387 --> 39:19.928
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:19.928 --> 39:22.431
I HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER

39:22.431 --> 39:23.662
THAN I HAVE WITH YOU.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.894
DANIEL, PLEASE.
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

39:28.967 --> 39:32.100
IT WAS WRONG OF ME TO GO
OFF MY MEDS AND NOT TELL YOU.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.371
I'M SORRY.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.903
NO. THIS WHOLE THING
IS MY FAULT.

39:34.903 --> 39:36.775
YOU CAME TO ME
AS A PATIENT.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.808
BUT WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU
SAW ME ONCE 25 YEARS AGO

39:39.808 --> 39:41.810
AND THAT YOU'D FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH ME AT FIRST SIGHT,

39:41.810 --> 39:44.613
I GUESS I WAS TAKEN
BY HOW ROMANTIC THAT SOUNDED.

39:44.613 --> 39:47.686
AND THEN YOU WENT ON YOUR MEDS,
AND YOU STARTED GETTING BETTER,

39:47.686 --> 39:49.387
AND I WAS SO ATTRACTED
TO YOU.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.520
BUT I GUESS I WAS THE ONE
THAT WAS DELUSIONAL

39:51.520 --> 39:54.793
TO CONVINCE MYSELF
THAT THERE WAS A WORLD

39:54.793 --> 39:58.667
IN WHICH THIS RELATIONSHIP COULD
BE HEALTHY FOR EITHER OF US.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.799

40:19.448 --> 40:20.719

THAT YOU'LL GET HELP.

ON YOUR MEDS.

40:22.851 --> 40:25.694

TO YOU THAN I DO.

Daniel: WHY DO WE BOTHER
WITH RELATIONSHIPS?

40:37.836 --> 40:40.769
NEUROPSYCHIATRISTS SAY
THAT WE'RE HARDWIRED

40:40.769 --> 40:42.741
TO CRAVE INTIMATE CONNECTIONS.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.974
WE LONG FOR LOVE.

OF COURSE, THE REALITY IS IT
USUALLY IT ENDS IN HEARTACHE,

PSYCHES BRUISED

WHY DO WE EVEN BOTHER
PLAYING THOSE ODDS?

41:13.241 --> 41:18.476
I GUESS BECAUSE WE ONLY
HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT ONCE.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.180
AND WHEN IT'S RIGHT, WE KNOW IT.

41:22.180 --> 41:26.785
EVEN THE MEMORY
OF A FULFILLING RELATIONSHIP

41:26.785 --> 41:29.658
CAN SUSTAIN US AND REMIND US

DOWN AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT,

41:34.062 --> 41:38.967
WE'RE NEVER TRULY ALONE.
