00:38.800 --> 00:40.900
She's hurt! Someone call 911!

00:40.900 --> 00:42.500
Stand back. I'm a doctor.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.000
All right,
sweetie. Okay.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.700
She may have
broken some ribs.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.200
Anybody know her parents?

00:52.500 --> 00:53.800
All right, I'm gonna take her
to the hospital.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.800
Help me get her up.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.200
- Ow! 
- Easy. Easy. That's
it. It's okay, sweetie.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.600
Thank you, sir.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Good luck.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.000
That really hurt.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.600
I think I sprained my wrist.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.200
Well, it's just a
flesh wound, darling.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.600
I can take you to the
hospital, or I can

01:13.600 --> 01:15.400
get you some Rocky Road?

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
Choice is yours.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Rocky Road.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.400
So, how much we get?

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
Want to count it?

01:27.900 --> 01:29.700
<i>Five and ten makes 20.</i>

01:29.700 --> 01:31.600
Thank you. Have a nice day.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.700
Hey.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.000
Long day?

01:37.400 --> 01:38.200
Boring day.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.600
Well, not sure
if it's the excitement

01:39.600 --> 01:40.500
that you're looking for,

01:40.500 --> 01:42.000
but, uh, you want
to come over tonight

01:42.000 --> 01:43.500
for a fake date
with Awesome and Ellie?

01:43.500 --> 01:46.500
I promise fake cuddling,
but real pizza.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.900
I'm sorry, Chuck.
I- I have plans.

01:49.300 --> 01:50.400
Oh. Is there a mission tonight?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.800
I- I don't remember
getting the memo.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.900
Uh, no.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.500
No mission. Just plans.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.500
Of course. Plans.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.600
Like any other single
28-year-old spy

01:58.600 --> 02:00.400
with an evening
to herself would have.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.700
I'm sorry, Chuck,
but it's personal.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.199
AUTO AUDIO INSTALL
JUST ASK A NERD.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.000
Hey.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.900
So, uh, ready for the
big mission tonight?

02:16.200 --> 02:16.700
What mission?

02:16.700 --> 02:17.800
You don't have to
play games, okay?

02:17.800 --> 02:20.100
I know. You and Sarah-
super secret mission.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.700
There's no mission, moron.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.000
She's taking a personal day.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.400
I didn't realize we
got personal days.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.100
Well, you don't. We do.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.600
Any idea what she's up to?

02:28.600 --> 02:29.900
- Yep.
- Well?

02:30.300 --> 02:31.400
It's personal.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.600
What do you think you're doing?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.700
Giving us a little privacy
so we can hook up.

02:41.000 --> 02:41.900
Come here.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.800
- Come on.
- Morgan! No!

02:43.900 --> 02:46.000
I'm sick of hooking up
only at work.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.600
Ah, I'd love to go some
place else, but where?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.300
My mother's always home,
you have three roommates.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.500
I mean, I'm open
to suggestions.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.700
Really? Good! Here.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.300
The Buena Burbank Apartments.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.900
They have really cute
one bedrooms.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.300
See, I can't afford this.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.100
We could together. We're ready

03:02.100 --> 03:03.300
to take the next step.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.700
Wow. We...

03:04.900 --> 03:06.000
That's, um...

03:06.700 --> 03:08.300
That's a very big
step, you know, and

03:08.300 --> 03:10.200
I think that it's not something
that you should rush into.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.900
I think that it's something
you should discuss.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.200
I mean, look at this
place, all right?

03:13.200 --> 03:16.400
72-inch plasma,
super comfy couches,

03:16.400 --> 03:17.500
all the free coffee
we can drink.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.500
I mean, come on, baby.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.500
We are living the dream.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.200
Whose dream, Morgan?

03:24.700 --> 03:25.600
Everyone's.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.900
Hey, Chuck, you ever wonder

03:29.900 --> 03:31.700
if you're not man enough
to hang onto your woman?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.100
I need a Nerd Herder.

03:33.100 --> 03:36.200
Uh-uh. No. Emmett found Jeff's
underwear in the back seat,

03:36.200 --> 03:37.600
and he's having them
all reupholstered

03:37.600 --> 03:39.500
as a safety precaution.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.600
Okay, Morgan, I need
to borrow your bike.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.900
Sure. Yeah, sure. Why?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.500
It's personal.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.500
Plans, huh?

04:04.100 --> 04:06.000
Honey, you look like
a million dollars.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.900
How old is this guy?

04:09.200 --> 04:10.300
Oh.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.900
Let's eat.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.700
Uh, excuse me
just a moment.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.900
Yes, I-I'd like
the linguini

04:41.900 --> 04:43.400
with the clam
sauce, please.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.100
How did you find me?

04:46.100 --> 04:47.600
The GPS on your watch.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.000
What are you doing here?

04:49.500 --> 04:50.300
Look, I'm-I'm sorry.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.400
I came for backup only.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.200
I told you, it was personal.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.500
I know. I know, but I flashed.

04:55.700 --> 04:56.600
Look,

04:56.800 --> 04:58.200
I'm all... I'm all
for a little time off,

04:58.200 --> 05:00.300
and God knows, you deserve it,
but I think that you should know

05:00.300 --> 05:02.200
that the much, much,
much older gentleman

05:02.200 --> 05:03.300
that you're having
dinner with right now

05:03.300 --> 05:04.700
is a very bad man, Sarah.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.900
- Chuck...
- Let me finish.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.500
The guy is a total loser,
all right?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.800
Absolute bottom-feeding,
scum of the earth,

05:09.800 --> 05:12.300
have I mentioned,
considerably older man?

05:13.500 --> 05:15.800
All true,
but I'm a hell of a dancer.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.800
Chuck, I'd like you
to meet my dad,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.200
Jack Burton.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.900
Dad, this is my boyfriend,
Chuck.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.900
A real pleasure, sir.

- Just how you like them. 
- When I was 12.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.500
Well, you need to eat something.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.700
Big day at work.

06:20.700 --> 06:21.800
What is it you're
doing again?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.100
Making milkshakes?

06:23.100 --> 06:24.200
Frozen yogurt.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.900
Oh. Sounds stimulating.

06:26.100 --> 06:26.700
Pays the bills.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.700
Well, yeah, I
can see that.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.300
Very believable.

06:30.700 --> 06:31.600
And what is that
supposed to mean?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.000
This place. Your job. Your name.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.800
Sarah Walker?

06:34.800 --> 06:36.800
That schnook from
last night. Chippy?

06:36.900 --> 06:38.900
- Chuck. 
- You're working an angle.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.300
I mean, he's probably the son

06:41.300 --> 06:43.800
of some, uh, rich
Beverly Hills family?

06:43.800 --> 06:47.300
Look, Chuck is my boyfriend,
and he makes $12 an hour,

06:47.300 --> 06:48.600
so you stay away from him.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.300
Hey, you don't want
to cut me in, fine.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.900
I don't need his money.

06:52.900 --> 06:53.900
I got my own.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.400
Oh, my God.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.300
That looks like almost
a million dollars.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.100
Well, Christmas
came a little early.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.100
For you.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.800
No, thanks.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.200
I'm not interested
in your stolen money.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.700
Stolen? That's what you think
of your old man,

07:08.700 --> 07:09.900
some two-bit thief?

07:09.900 --> 07:11.900
Darling, a thief has
to run out of town

07:11.900 --> 07:14.100
as fast as he can,
but a good con man...

07:14.100 --> 07:16.300
A good con man can leave
whenever he wants.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.200
I remember, Dad.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.400
So, who donated the money
anyway?

07:20.400 --> 07:22.500
A couple months ago,
I flew over to Dubai.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.800
You wouldn't believe
the kind of money

07:23.800 --> 07:25.400
they got floating
over there. Oh!

07:25.400 --> 07:30.100
This particular donation is
compliments of Sheik Rajiv Amad.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.400
Amad? The Saudi oil family?

07:32.700 --> 07:34.200
My daughter knows her Arabs.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.500
I got to go to work.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.000
Um...

07:38.800 --> 07:39.700
forgetting something?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.400
Have fun at the office.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
<i>GENERAL, In the spirit
of full disclosure,</i>

07:45.500 --> 07:47.700
my father has conned
Sheik Rajiv Amad

07:47.700 --> 07:49.600
out of nearly
a million dollars.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.300
Hit the big time.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.000
Give the order,
and I'll bring him in.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
What?! You're gonna arrest
your own father?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.500
Isn't that kind of
a conflict of interest?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.900
If Agent Walker's
uncomfortable,

07:57.900 --> 07:59.500
I'd be happy to
make the arrest.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.100
No one is getting arrested. Yet.

08:02.100 --> 08:05.100
Amad's been on the CIA's
terror watch list for years.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.100
He's suspected
of funding terrorist regimes

08:07.100 --> 08:08.700
in Afghanistan and Kenya.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.900
We have no recent photos,

08:09.900 --> 08:12.200
and he goes by a number
of different aliases.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.800
Any information
your father could provide

08:13.800 --> 08:15.300
about the sheik's
financial holdings

08:15.300 --> 08:16.800
would be valuable intel.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.300
General, my father is unaware

08:18.300 --> 08:19.700
of my CIA career.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.600
In fact, I'm not sure
he would be all that proud.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.700
No one is asking you

08:23.700 --> 08:26.000
to compromise your cover,
Agent Walker.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.600
Just talk to your father.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.900
Take the Intersect with you.

08:28.900 --> 08:29.900
General, my father...

08:29.900 --> 08:31.800
Your father conned
a very connected,

08:31.800 --> 08:33.200
very dangerous man.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.700
You better find out how deep

08:34.700 --> 08:36.799
he's in before the sheik does.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.100
- Captain Morgan.
- Hey, buddy.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.799
Uh, have you
seen Chuck?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.300
Left for work. What's up?

08:46.000 --> 08:46.800
What's up?

08:46.900 --> 08:49.700
Basically, my life is
over, that's what up.

08:49.900 --> 08:50.700
You ready for this?

08:51.100 --> 08:52.600
Anna asked me
to get an apartment together.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.200
Whoa!

08:54.600 --> 08:57.400
Big step, little man. All right.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.000
I don't know
about all right.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.600
I- I... You know what, man?

09:01.600 --> 09:03.200
I just don't think
I'm ready for that.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.600
Things are good with us.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.300
You know, why-why
rock the boat?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.300
Permission to speak freely?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.300
There are no
secrets between us.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.300
Would you agree
that you have no credit,

09:13.700 --> 09:15.900
no life plan,
no apartment, no car,

09:15.900 --> 09:18.200
no adult responsibilities
of any kind?

09:20.500 --> 09:22.700
On rare occasion,
I do my own laundry.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.900
Time to grow up, Morgan.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.500
I know. Here's the thing.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.300
This apartment-
it's a lot of dough.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.000
It'll clear me out.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're a little short on cash,

09:31.200 --> 09:32.400
you know, we'll lend it to you.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.200
Don't worry about it.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.100
Wait a minute.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.500
You'd do that for me? Really?

09:36.800 --> 09:37.500
Yeah.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.700
That's-That's super cool, man.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.100
Why?

09:42.200 --> 09:43.500
Because I believe in you.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.000
Consider it an investment
in your future.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.900
Whoa. Are you...
Are you sure about that?

09:47.900 --> 09:49.300
Yes, I'm sure.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
Besides, you'll pay me back.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.500
12% interest every week,
or it goes up two points.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.100
Absolutely. What does that mean?

09:55.100 --> 09:57.500
$2,500 should cover it.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.100
There you go, Morgan.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.900
Welcome to adulthood.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.900
We've been waiting for you.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.300
<i>Sarah was just bluffing
with Beckman, right?</i>

10:06.300 --> 10:08.000
I mean, she'd never
arrest her own father.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.900
Why not? Guy's a criminal.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.200
Been in and out of jail
her whole life.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.100
But he... but he
seems to care, though.

10:15.100 --> 10:15.600
You know, I
mean, at least

10:15.600 --> 10:17.500
he's attempting to
have a relationship.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.500
I don't even know where
my own father is.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.900
Oh, that's sad.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.000
You've confused me with someone

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
that cares about your life
before the Intersect.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.500
Good session, buddy.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.300
Really feel like
we had a breakthrough there.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.800
So long, Chuck.

10:30.700 --> 10:31.400
We had a good
run, didn't we?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.200
Stuff of legend.
Where you headed?

10:33.500 --> 10:34.600
Adulthood.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.100
Anna and I are moving in
together.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.300
Really? That's fantastic!
Congratulations, buddy.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.300
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.800
Enjoy your youth,

10:42.900 --> 10:43.800
Charles.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.800
Enjoy every damn
minute of it.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.700
Dude, have you seen her?!

11:01.700 --> 11:03.600
Who?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.700
Just the hottest piece ever

11:04.700 --> 11:06.300
- to come into this store! 
- Not even human.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.300
- Smoking hot.
- Where?

11:08.700 --> 11:11.100
Follow your boys.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.700
1981 DeLorean DMC.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.600
Only 9,000 made.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.200
<i>The exact car from
Back to the Future.</i>

11:25.500 --> 11:26.000
Actually,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.500
<i>the Back to the Future car
had a Porsche engine.</i>

11:28.900 --> 11:30.000
When's it going
to be done?

11:30.900 --> 11:31.900
Few weeks.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.200
Months, at least.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.500
Well, hopefully the iPod
adapter will help me sell it.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.700
Are you serious?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.400
How could you have any trouble
selling this treasure?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.400
The passenger door
doesn't work,

11:41.400 --> 11:42.900
the gas mileage
is horrible,

11:42.900 --> 11:45.600
and if it actually goes
over 22 miles per hour,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.100
it stalls.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.500
REALLY?

11:53.700 --> 11:54.600
I'll take it.

11:55.300 --> 11:55.800
Deal.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.000
Yes!

11:57.400 --> 11:57.900
Good boy.

11:57.900 --> 11:58.600
<i>He's not a schnook!</i>

11:58.600 --> 12:00.100
He's a wonderful caring,

12:00.100 --> 12:01.100
intelligent guy.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.500
Who's a class A schnook.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.300
Look, you don't want
to cut me in, no problem.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.800
But don't play me
for a fool.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.800
The guy has 2,200 bucks
to his name.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.600
How do you know?

12:11.100 --> 12:13.100
I lifted his ATM card
last night.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.400
I wanted to check him out

12:15.400 --> 12:17.100
'cause I was worried
about you.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.800
And now that you know
he's broke?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.200
Now, I'm really worried.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.500
I'm going to get a cab.

12:25.300 --> 12:25.800
Charlie,

12:25.800 --> 12:27.200
- there you are.
- Hi.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.700
Good to see you again,
Mr. Burton.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.400
Oh, please, please, Jack.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.700
Nice tie.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.100
Looking sharp, young man.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.500
Well, I think he's warming up
to me.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.400
This accidentally fell
into my father's pocket.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.400
It's okay.

12:42.700 --> 12:43.900
He's just being
protective of you.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.200
And after the way
I behaved last night,

12:45.200 --> 12:46.600
I can't say that I blame him.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.100
Chuck, you're attributing
good intentions to him

12:49.100 --> 12:50.400
because you're a good person.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.900
Well, he must have done
something right.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.800
You turned out pretty good.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
Let's go.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.000
<i>The trick wasit had to be
an actual accident.</i>

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Angel here was the best.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.700
She could make a real doc

13:03.700 --> 13:05.200
believe that she had
a broken arm.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.900
Uh, that's because
I did.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.100
One time-
that's only because

13:08.100 --> 13:09.600
the armored truck
hit a patch of ice.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.800
Unforeseeable
act of God, honey.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.700
At least your childhood
was filled with excitement.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.900
No kid had as much fun
as you did.

13:19.700 --> 13:20.400
Um,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.400
so this latest,
uh, score?

13:24.900 --> 13:26.800
Sarah said you were just
in Dubai?

13:28.200 --> 13:28.900
Sure it's okay?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.700
Oh, he's fine. Trust me.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.300
Always, darling.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.100
Never forget that.

13:34.700 --> 13:38.100
Something about, uh,
a rich sheik?

13:39.700 --> 13:41.500
I'm not a boastful man, Charlie,

13:41.500 --> 13:44.100
<i>but this was my Mona Lisa.</i>

13:44.100 --> 13:45.800
These oil guys
were just

13:45.800 --> 13:48.600
dying to buy anything American.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.200
Oh, no. You didn't.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.700
Oh, yeah. Of course I did.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.000
I think I'm missing
a step here.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.900
He pulled a
Lichtenstein.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.200
A Lichten what?

13:57.200 --> 14:00.000
Lichtenstein is a crazy
invention of my father's.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.400
A German billionaire
who has fallen on hard times,

14:02.400 --> 14:04.100
and needs to sell
something fast.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.600
So, like, a piece of art,

14:05.600 --> 14:07.800
- or jewelry?
- Bigger.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.100
A boat? A plane?

14:09.100 --> 14:10.100
Closer, Charlie.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.400
But I brought you

14:11.400 --> 14:13.200
to my hotel for
a reason.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.000
I sold them that.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.100
You...

14:23.200 --> 14:24.500
What?! You sold them

14:24.500 --> 14:26.400
Nagamichi Plaza?
That's incredible.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.500
That's dangerous.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.100
- They're going to find you.
- Oh, relax.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.000
The 700 grand
is a finder's fee

14:31.000 --> 14:32.700
for putting them in touch
with Lichtenstein.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.900
By the time they know it's gone,
I'll be on an island.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.100
Remember, Charlie,
the bigger the lie,

14:37.200 --> 14:39.400
- the easier...
- The easier it is to believe.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.700
Very good.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.700
<i>You think your dad
bought us as a couple?</i>

14:44.700 --> 14:47.900
- He's a pretty sharp guy.
- He has his moments.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.100
Maybe we should
amp up the PDA.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.500
Try and sell it
a little better.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.700
Very funny.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.800
Just make sure you
have your wallet.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.400
Oh!

15:07.400 --> 15:08.600
I just flashed.
That's him.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.200
That's Sheik Rajiv Amad.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.200
- Stay here. 
- What do you think he wants?

15:12.300 --> 15:13.100
What do you think?

15:13.100 --> 15:14.300
Lichtenstein.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.700
Too bad
he doesn't exist.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.300
<i>This, uh, this has all</i>

15:17.300 --> 15:18.800
been a terrible
misunderstanding.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.900
Why don't we

15:19.900 --> 15:20.700
meet in the morning

15:20.700 --> 15:22.400
in Mr. Lichtenstein's
office

15:22.400 --> 15:24.100
and we can settle
this whole mess.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.200
You must think I'm a fool,
Mr. Burton.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.400
I want my money.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.900
Well, you want
your money back,

15:29.900 --> 15:31.300
that's fine,
but I have to warn you

15:31.300 --> 15:33.600
then the deal is off.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.400
In fact,

15:35.400 --> 15:37.800
uh, this is
Mr. Lichtenstein's

15:37.800 --> 15:39.900
personal secretary right here.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.100
Ms. Applebaum?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.400
May I present
Sheik Rajiv Amad.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
It's a pleasure to meet you.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.900
Mr. Lichtenstein has

15:46.900 --> 15:47.900
been expecting you.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.500
How's tomorrow at 2:00?

15:51.300 --> 15:52.600
I have a better idea.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.800
Why don't we go
get him right now?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.400
I thought so.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.500
There's no Lichtenstein.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.100
Mr. Lichtenstein?!

16:06.800 --> 16:09.000
Is there
a Mr. Lichtenstein here?

16:09.800 --> 16:10.500
<i>Ja.</i>

16:10.500 --> 16:13.000
Uh, Mr. Lichtenstein,
you have a message.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.200
Uh, Sheik Rajiv Amad,

16:19.200 --> 16:20.800
may I present

16:21.000 --> 16:23.700
Hans Lichtenstein.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Unfortunately, Mr. Lichtenstein
only speaks German.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.100
But he'll be happy to meet you
tomorrow at his office.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
2:00?

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
Okay.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.700
But if I don't get
my building,

16:43.400 --> 16:44.500
he's a dead man.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.500
Translate that.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.300
Okay.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.700
I knew you two
were on the grift.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.100
???

17:05.599 --> 17:07.000
Hey, honey,
why is there

17:07.000 --> 17:09.400
$2,500 missing
from our account?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.400
I forgot to tell you,
I lent it to Morgan.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.200
I can only assume

17:13.200 --> 17:15.400
that you met some other Morgan
at work,

17:15.400 --> 17:17.099
because the thought
of you giving away

17:17.099 --> 17:18.099
a hunk of our nest egg

17:18.099 --> 17:20.800
is just too horrific
to consider.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.300
I didn't give it away.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.300
I lent it to him

17:23.300 --> 17:24.800
so he can get an
apartment with Anna.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.400
Uh, Chuck, how much does Morgan
make at the Buy More?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.300
Uh, about 12 bucks an hour.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.900
Not including
his always

17:30.900 --> 17:32.300
appreciating comic
book collection

17:32.300 --> 17:34.500
which I would value
in the $500 area.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.300
Devon...

17:35.300 --> 17:37.200
It was an investment
in his future.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.800
You know, so he could
become an adult.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.700
That would probably be Morgan.

17:40.700 --> 17:41.900
He's giving me a ride to work.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.300
On what, his handlebars?

17:44.100 --> 17:45.300
No, uh,

17:46.200 --> 17:47.600
uh, Morgan,

17:47.600 --> 17:51.400
Morgan bought a barely
functioning '81 DeLorean

17:51.400 --> 17:52.500
that...

17:52.500 --> 17:54.900
only goes 22 miles an hour,
so I better get going.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.000
See ya.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.100
You don't have to say it, babe.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.700
I'll get our money back.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.200
<i>General, I'd like to apologize</i>

18:04.200 --> 18:05.000
for last night.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.200
Chuck never should have
gotten caught up

18:06.200 --> 18:07.900
in my father's
ridiculous con.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.500
I recommend we place the
Intersect in protective lockdown

18:10.500 --> 18:12.000
till we're sure the sheik
is out of the country.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.900
And waste the perfect setup?

18:13.900 --> 18:15.100
I'm not sure I follow.

18:15.100 --> 18:18.000
The CIA has been trying to
locate the hidden bank accounts

18:18.000 --> 18:19.800
of the Amad family for years.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.100
If you can convince him
to wire you the funds,

18:22.200 --> 18:24.300
we can access those accounts
and freeze them.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.600
Uh, funds for what?

18:25.700 --> 18:26.500
The building.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
It will need to be
at least $10 million

18:28.800 --> 18:30.800
to access his international
accounts.

18:30.800 --> 18:34.700
General, is the agency
asking us to commit fraud?

18:34.700 --> 18:38.500
No, that would mean the CIA has
some knowledge of your mission.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.900
How are we supposed to sell a
60-story building in one day?

18:42.300 --> 18:43.500
Ask your father.

18:43.900 --> 18:46.900
He seems to be very proficient
in his chosen profession.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.800
- Wait, this is the sound
coming from here. 
- Oh, that's...

18:51.800 --> 18:53.300
Yeah, you thought
that the...

18:53.400 --> 18:54.700
- No.
- Do you know where Morgan is?

18:54.700 --> 18:56.100
Who's to say?
If he was able

18:56.100 --> 18:58.200
to get a hold of some
high-grade plutonium,

18:58.300 --> 18:59.400
he could be anywhere.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.500
Any place.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.000
- Any time.
- The Old West perhaps?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
If I could travel
in time,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.900
I'd go to Lester's birth.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.600
I'd love to see the look
on your face

19:07.600 --> 19:10.100
when you emerged
from the vaginal canal.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.500
Morgan went to the DMV to get
plates for the DeLorean.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.200
I lent him that money
to get an apartment,

19:18.200 --> 19:20.200
not blow it on some
stupid car.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.400
What?!

19:21.400 --> 19:23.300
That money was
for our apartment?!

19:23.300 --> 19:24.300
I'm gonna kill him.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.800
Get in line, Anna.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.800
All right,
here's the thing.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.700
I beg both of you
to reserve judgment

19:30.700 --> 19:31.900
until you've seen
the plate.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.900
'Cause you are
gonna be..

19:34.800 --> 19:37.600
Oh. Yeah.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.500
I nailed it, right?

19:40.900 --> 19:42.100
You have exactly one day

19:42.100 --> 19:43.700
to get my money back
to me or I pluck you

19:43.700 --> 19:44.700
from head
to toe.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.200
Start with the groin.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.600
He won't be using that region
for a while.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.100
But, honey...
I got it for us.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.300
<i>There is no reason
to walk away now.</i>

19:58.300 --> 19:59.500
You know, I think we
could get the sheik

19:59.500 --> 20:01.000
to pay a three
percent deposit.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Market value is over
$300 million...

20:04.000 --> 20:05.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's a lot of dough.

20:05.700 --> 20:08.700
Remember darling, pigs get fat,
hogs get slaughtered.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.400
Well, the bigger the lie,
the easier it is to believe.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.900
We can do this.

20:17.900 --> 20:21.300
I guess, uh, 5 mill each
ain't too bad.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.700
Two point five.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.700
You want my help, you
have to use my team.

20:26.900 --> 20:27.900
What team?

20:28.400 --> 20:29.400
Mmm.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.300
He's got a cop face.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.900
No offense.

20:35.400 --> 20:35.700
Look,

20:35.700 --> 20:37.900
either he's in,
or none of us are.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.800
Fine. But he's your problem.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.900
All right, Sarah and I
will handle the deal.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.000
Cop Face,

20:46.100 --> 20:47.100
you're security.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.700
We can switch names
if you'd like.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.800
I can be Cop Face
and you can be Schnook.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.600
We'll use our account number

20:52.600 --> 20:54.000
for the wire transfer.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
Don't trust you.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.700
No offense.

20:58.200 --> 20:58.600
Uh,

20:58.600 --> 21:00.200
question-
what about me?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.800
<i>I mean, I'm familiar
with Hogan's Heroes</i>

21:01.800 --> 21:03.000
<i>and Castle Wolfenstein,</i>

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
but beyond that
my German is a little rusty.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Schnook, your job is going
to be toughest of all.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.100
You need to sit there
and not say a word.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.900
All right, everybody
gather around.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.500
First, we need

21:13.500 --> 21:16.900
<i>to evacuate the current
building management.</i>
NAGAMICHI BUILDING 51ST FLOOR

21:17.500 --> 21:18.700
Can I have your attention
please?

21:18.700 --> 21:21.300
We need everyone out of this
office immediately.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.900
This floor is being fumigated.

21:22.900 --> 21:23.500
We have already

21:23.500 --> 21:25.100
released toxic fumes.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.400
That can lead to infertility

21:27.700 --> 21:29.200
and low sperm count.

21:35.000 --> 21:35.900
All right,
you heard them.

21:35.900 --> 21:36.900
Everyone out.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.100
Let's go, people.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.500
Quickly. Quickly.

21:41.100 --> 21:41.400
<i>Next,</i>

21:41.400 --> 21:44.300
<i>we need to redecorate
Lichtenstein Enterprises.</i>

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
<i>Cop Face,</i>

21:50.600 --> 21:52.600
<i>you're going to use
the gifts God gave you-</i>
LOBBY

21:52.800 --> 21:54.100
<i>your cop face.</i>

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
They're here.

22:07.700 --> 22:08.700
Showtime.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.700
<i>Most importantly,
we need to convince him</i>

22:30.700 --> 22:32.400
<i>that we don't want
to sell the building.</i>

22:32.400 --> 22:34.600
<i>He's the one
getting the deal, not us.</i>

22:34.600 --> 22:35.900
I'm sorry,
Mr. Lichtenstein

22:35.900 --> 22:37.900
will be in Prague
on Friday.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.800
No, Monday
he's in Moscow.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.600
Wendy, I don't want
to be interrupted.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.900
I don't care
if Mr. Trump calls.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.100
Tell him the building
is no longer for sale.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.900
I'll see him next week
in New York.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.700
- Gentlemen, welcome.
- We'll have

22:50.700 --> 22:52.600
to call you back next week.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.000
Bye-bye.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.300
Mr. Lichtenstein
will see you now.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.300
Gentlemen,
may I present to you

23:10.500 --> 23:12.800
Mr. Hans Lichtenstein.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.000
Well, I'm sure

23:19.000 --> 23:20.100
you're very busy,
so we'll make this

23:20.100 --> 23:22.500
as painless as possible-
after your lawyers

23:22.500 --> 23:24.700
examine the contracts
and the inspections

23:24.700 --> 23:26.700
are done, we can have
a more formal meeting.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.600
For now, we only require
a three percent deposit

23:29.600 --> 23:31.500
to take the property
off the market.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.000
And that would be...

23:33.500 --> 23:34.800
$10 million.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.100
First, I would like
to have a word

23:38.100 --> 23:39.800
with Mr. Lichtenstein.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.800
Of course.
I'll translate.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.600
<i>Herr Amad m. chte ein Wort
mit Ihnen.</i>
Mr. Amad would like a word with you.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.900
I'm sorry.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.700
I don't trust you.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.900
I brought
my own translator.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.300
<i>Hallo, Herr
Lichtenstein.</i>
hello, Mr. Lichtenstein.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.100
<i>Irgendetwas, das
Sie sagen m. gen,</i>
anything you wish to say...

23:54.200 --> 23:55.600
<i>sagen Sie durch mich.</i>
... you say through me.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.400
That is the worst German accent
I have ever heard.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.300
You... you butcher
my language.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.000
The deal is off.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.000
Sounds like Colonel Klink.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.000
So, as far as you know,
no one ordered

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
an exterminator today?

24:17.100 --> 24:18.100
I'm on my way now

24:18.100 --> 24:19.900
to find out what the hell
is going on.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.100
We got company.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.200
Time to wrap it up.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.400
I'm sorry, Mr. Amad.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.000
It looks like
the deal is off,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.400
but if I could have
your account number,

24:27.400 --> 24:28.500
I'd be happy to wire you

24:28.500 --> 24:30.200
the $700,000
that you gave

24:30.200 --> 24:31.400
- to Mr. Burton.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.700
Now, there's no
reason to panic.

24:32.700 --> 24:33.700
Everyone,
calm down.

24:33.700 --> 24:34.900
We can work this out.

24:35.900 --> 24:37.300
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

24:37.300 --> 24:38.500
Out of my building.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.400
The deal is off.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.600
Mr. Lichtenstein
has been offended.

24:42.700 --> 24:43.900
Everyone out of the building.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.300
There's no reason
to panic.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.600
Uh, we're all
businessmen here.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.000
Let's just sit down
and finish...

24:53.000 --> 24:54.200
Enough!

24:54.300 --> 24:55.400
You're all crazy.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.800
No more games.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.100
This is my building.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.200
We had a deal.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.000
Uh, well, Sheik, would you care
to, uh, type in

25:07.000 --> 25:09.200
your account number
for security purposes?

25:10.100 --> 25:13.200
Uh, just go ahead
and do the typey type.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.300
<i>Feel free to look
over the space.</i>

25:16.300 --> 25:17.900
We'll, uh,
give you a moment.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.300
Never do business
with Germans.

25:21.800 --> 25:22.700
Who the hell are you?

25:22.700 --> 25:24.000
And how did you
get up here?

25:25.300 --> 25:27.100
Why does that wall
say Lichtenstein?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.200
To Lichtenstein.

25:35.900 --> 25:36.600
Well,

25:36.800 --> 25:38.000
you pulled it off, kid.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.300
You made me
a believer.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.100
Well, my German
is a little rusty, but...

25:42.100 --> 25:43.900
No, no, that you two
are a couple.

25:46.900 --> 25:48.400
For later, Cop Face.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.500
Oh, victory smoke. Thanks.

25:50.900 --> 25:51.800
You did good, baby.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.800
- So did you.
- I'm gonna get some ice.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.500
Well, I'm not one
to say I told you so,

25:59.500 --> 26:00.600
but I think that worked out

26:00.600 --> 26:02.000
pretty good, now,
didn't it?

26:02.200 --> 26:05.200
I guess he pulled through
for me... this one time.

26:06.700 --> 26:07.600
Uh-huh.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.000
Yes, General?

26:09.900 --> 26:11.000
Mission accomplished.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.400
The money was transferred
to the CIA account

26:12.400 --> 26:13.500
about an hour ago.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.800
Beckman never got the money.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.400
The laptop is gone.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.500
So is my cigar.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.500
Hey.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.700
They were all
out of fruit,

26:53.700 --> 26:55.100
so I was forced
to bring up

26:55.100 --> 26:56.700
a couple chocolate
croissants.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.900
Oh, I guess I have no choice
but to take those off you.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.100
Come in.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.600
You okay?

27:08.100 --> 27:09.300
I'm fine.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.300
My dad will turn up
somewhere,

27:11.700 --> 27:12.900
but, uh, I guess
the real crime

27:12.900 --> 27:15.500
is that we didn't get
to freeze the sheik's accounts.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.400
Well, I'm sorry
if I pushed you

27:18.400 --> 27:19.900
into trusting your father.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.000
If there's one thing I learned
from my father,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.400
it's be ready
for disappointment.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.500
And if it's anyone's
fault, it's mine.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.300
No, it's not.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.800
11 years ago, my father
left Ellie and me.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.200
He's a...

27:37.800 --> 27:39.200
he was an unusual man.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.700
I guess that's generous.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.700
An engineer.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.600
We used to get Christmas
cards and birthday calls,

27:45.600 --> 27:48.100
and then one year it
just... it just stopped.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.800
I don't know why.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.000
What I do know

27:52.800 --> 27:54.500
is that it
wasn't my fault.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.600
Granted, it took a significant
amount of time and...

27:59.000 --> 28:00.200
an incredible
amount of therapy

28:00.200 --> 28:01.600
to come to that
realization,

28:01.600 --> 28:02.500
but...

28:05.800 --> 28:07.400
you need to know that
your father's sins

28:07.400 --> 28:09.500
are his and not yours.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.700
That's pretty eloquent
for 9:00 a. m.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.000
What can I say?

28:17.600 --> 28:19.900
I am an articulate schnook.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.100
Lucky for me.

28:23.900 --> 28:24.800
You're alone?

28:25.400 --> 28:26.200
Yes, General.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.800
We've tracked down Jack Burton.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.700
He checked into a downtown motel

28:29.700 --> 28:32.100
under the alias, Guido Merkins.

28:32.900 --> 28:35.300
Well, I understand the
sensitivity of the situation.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.500
I'll go alone.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Agent Casey?

28:38.500 --> 28:39.200
Yeah?

28:39.800 --> 28:41.600
Tell Agent Walker I'm sorry.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.400
Roger that.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.200
<i>Where am I going
to find $2,500?</i>

28:51.300 --> 28:52.200
Charles.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.200
Hey, my man.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.000
Looking well
as usual.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.800
Oh, my, and that... that scent.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.300
It's like the beach
after the rains.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.000
What do you call it?

29:03.300 --> 29:04.300
Deodorant.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.900
What do you want?

29:06.300 --> 29:08.100
I, uh... I need
to borrow some money

29:08.100 --> 29:10.500
or your future
brother-in-I's gonna...

29:10.500 --> 29:12.100
pluck me from head to toe.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.600
- How much we talking?
- Um,

29:13.600 --> 29:14.500
not too much.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.100
$2,500?

29:17.200 --> 29:18.100
Give or take.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.000
You did good, babe.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.700
<i>No kid had as much fun
as you did.</i>

30:04.500 --> 30:05.900
UNKNOWN CALLER

30:12.600 --> 30:13.200
What?

30:13.200 --> 30:14.200
Baby, I'm sorry,

30:14.500 --> 30:16.700
but I got a perfect excuse
for what happened.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.900
Well, I'd love
to hear all about it.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.100
Some other time.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.800
Just remember,
I did it all for you.

30:23.500 --> 30:24.400
So touching.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.700
Oh, so touching-
family reunion.

30:26.900 --> 30:29.300
Now, where the hell
is my money?

30:30.100 --> 30:31.500
I don't have it.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.100
Well, then,
we have a real problem.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.600
Don't give it
to him, honey.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.900
If anything happens
to my father...

30:37.900 --> 30:40.600
What, you will con me
out of more money?

30:41.700 --> 30:43.900
No... I'll kill you.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.600
Then, bring me what is mine,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.400
and we won't
have a problem.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.100
Okay?

30:49.600 --> 30:51.000
I'll call you in an hour.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.500
TRANSMISSION LOST

31:00.500 --> 31:01.400
Thank you so
much for this.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.300
Oh, yeah.

31:03.900 --> 31:04.700
Do you mind?

31:04.800 --> 31:07.400
Oh, I can't
know your PIN?

31:07.900 --> 31:09.400
I'll give you mine if it
makes you feel better.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.500
- There are some boundaries, Morgan. 
- Okay.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.900
All right,
all right, I'm sorry.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.200
Oh, my God.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.300
"Oh, my God," what?

31:20.300 --> 31:21.800
Oh, you're broke,
right? It's okay.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.300
Don't feel bad,
dude. You know what?

31:23.500 --> 31:24.900
There are places
I could use some grooming,

31:25.300 --> 31:27.000
SO, FORGET ABOUT IT.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.300
ALANCE INQUIRY
CHECKING ACCOUNT
ACCOUNT BALANCE

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
Hey, hey, Sarah.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.700
Look, I hope this
isn't a mistake

31:48.700 --> 31:50.500
and the CIA has decided
to compensate me

31:50.500 --> 31:52.500
- for my numerous acts of heroism... 
- Later, Chuck.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.300
but there happens to be
an extra- oh, I don't know-

31:54.300 --> 31:56.400
$10 million in my ATM account.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.600
What? Why would my father

31:58.600 --> 32:00.600
- put the sheik's money in your account? 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.200
Again, we're not so sure that
this is coming from your father.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.300
I'm still clinging
to the compensation theory.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.100
Leave it there.

32:08.300 --> 32:09.300
You know, that's
not a bad idea.

32:09.300 --> 32:11.300
It should earn a couple
thousand a day in interest.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.400
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

32:13.400 --> 32:14.600
It's personal.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.300
Hey, hey.

32:19.900 --> 32:20.900
- You seen Walker?
- Yeah, she just left

32:20.900 --> 32:22.300
in a real big hurry
with two duffel bags

32:22.300 --> 32:24.500
stuffed full of T-shirts
and some serious firepower.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.500
Where are you going?

32:25.600 --> 32:26.700
It's personal.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.000
Morgan.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
- Morgan.
- Yeah, buddy.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.300
Morgan, I'm gonna
loan you the money.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.400
Oh, thank you.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.000
First, I need to
borrow the De-Morgan.

32:35.000 --> 32:35.800
It's an emergency.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.100
Oh, absolutely, yeah,
yeah, yours, done.

32:38.300 --> 32:39.100
What's up?

32:39.400 --> 32:40.500
It's personal.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.500
Treat her well, my friend.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.300
That's close enough.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.500
You have something for me?

33:13.800 --> 33:15.000
Where's my father?

33:16.700 --> 33:17.500
Hey.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.100
Yeah.

33:48.900 --> 33:49.900
Nothing.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.700
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

34:07.700 --> 34:08.600
I have your money right here.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.500
- Hey, no!
- Grab her gun!

34:16.900 --> 34:19.300
Mr. Lichtenstein,
thank you for joining.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.199
Here to sell me
the DeLorean?

34:21.199 --> 34:22.300
I have your money, okay?

34:22.300 --> 34:24.400
And I can wire it to you
right now.

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
If you're lying,

34:27.699 --> 34:29.600
I will put a bullet in her head.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.699
All I need
is your account number.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.699
Please. We're just a couple
of bad con men

34:38.699 --> 34:40.400
who got in way too deep.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.699
All right? All we want to do
is give you your money back.

34:43.199 --> 34:44.900
Come take it and let us go.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.199
ACTIVE ACCOUNT
ENTER ACCOUNT#

34:53.199 --> 34:55.199
The sheik's account number. Hmm.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.900
Decent plan, Bartowski.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.300
Of course
I'll never tell him that.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.600
There. You have
your money.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.200
Pleasure doing business.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.000
Now kill them.

35:10.300 --> 35:11.100
What?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.100
OKAY.

35:20.700 --> 35:21.600
Hold it right there!

35:21.600 --> 35:23.000
U.S. Treasury.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.800
Don't anybody move.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.700
Send 'em up,
boys. I got him.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.300
I got Lichtenstein.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.400
- Come on.
- Oh!

35:33.500 --> 35:34.400
Yeah.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Yeah, you're really...

35:37.300 --> 35:38.600
You're really selling it there,
Casey.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.500
Yeah.

35:40.300 --> 35:41.400
Is this a joke?

35:41.900 --> 35:42.900
Huh? Where's your backup?

35:42.900 --> 35:45.200
Oh. I'm just the tip
of the spear.

35:45.300 --> 35:47.100
Rest of the crew's
on their way up.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.400
I've been following
these grifters for months now.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.800
You know, if you gentlemen
would be willing

35:51.800 --> 35:53.900
to testify, I'm sure

35:53.900 --> 35:56.400
we can get the weapons
charges dropped, hmm?

35:58.500 --> 35:59.200
Drop it!

36:00.200 --> 36:01.300
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

36:01.300 --> 36:05.000
You lower your weapon,
or I will kill your father.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.700
If I did that to him,
imagine what I'll do to you.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.200
Drop your weapon!

36:28.600 --> 36:29.500
Oh!

36:33.600 --> 36:34.800
Amad's getting away.

36:34.900 --> 36:37.100
Not at 22 miles an hour
he's not.

36:39.300 --> 36:40.100
All clear.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.600
Dad.

36:46.800 --> 36:47.600
Hey.

36:48.300 --> 36:49.200
Yeah, thanks.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.400
Little rough with
the cuffs, though.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.700
Yeah. Call it in.

36:51.800 --> 36:52.900
You didn't use blanks?

36:52.900 --> 36:54.100
What's wrong
with you people?

36:54.600 --> 36:56.200
It's just a flesh wound.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.100
Yeah. Hi.

36:59.100 --> 37:01.400
I'd like to report
a stolen '81 DeLorean.

37:01.500 --> 37:06.200
License plate is
D- E-M-O-R-G-A-N.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.400
???

37:09.500 --> 37:11.500
Thanks to your efforts,
we were able to freeze

37:11.500 --> 37:14.400
nearly a billion dollars
of the sheik's foreign accounts.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.300
Well done.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.200
General.

37:16.200 --> 37:16.800
Hmm.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.600
Now, to the unpleasant news.

37:18.700 --> 37:20.600
Agent Walker, we're sending
a unit to your hotel

37:20.600 --> 37:22.100
to pick up your father
for the previous

37:22.100 --> 37:24.400
embezzlement charge
at 5:00 today.

37:25.800 --> 37:26.900
Say your good-byes.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.700
- That's all.
- General?

37:29.700 --> 37:31.400
As you know,
Mr. Burton was invaluable

37:31.400 --> 37:32.800
in the seizure
of these funds.

37:34.500 --> 37:37.100
Perhaps that could lessen
his prison sentence.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.500
Prosecution will be made aware
of that.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.600
Thank you.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.400
<i>You're not going
to believe this.</i>

37:57.900 --> 37:58.700
The police just called.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.300
The DeLorean was stolen.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.700
Morgan, I've been meaning
to tell you...

38:02.700 --> 38:03.900
Dude, do you know
what that means?

38:03.900 --> 38:05.100
They have to impound the car.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.100
I'm gonna get
Blue Book value.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.600
I'll pay back Awesome,
and I'll still

38:07.600 --> 38:09.300
have ten large!
Dude, I'm rich!

38:09.300 --> 38:10.700
Aah! We're rich.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.700
Now, we can move in together
in style.

38:12.700 --> 38:15.500
I am doing the whole living room
in shabby chic.

38:17.000 --> 38:17.800
Love you.

38:17.800 --> 38:18.900
<i>Love you.</i>

38:19.600 --> 38:21.600
Oh. Kiss. Kiss. Oh. Mmm.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.800
Yummy kisses.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.500
Well, you have to grow
up sometime, you know?

38:25.500 --> 38:27.700
The right girl, the right time.
I'm proud of you, buddy. Thank you.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.000
Dude, you're not

38:29.000 --> 38:29.800
gonna believe
what just showed up

38:29.800 --> 38:30.600
in the Audio Install.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.100
- Morgan, no!
- Yes.

38:32.100 --> 38:32.800
- No.
- Yes.

38:32.800 --> 38:33.600
DO NOT.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.700
Well, it couldn't hurt

38:34.700 --> 38:36.000
to look, you know...

38:41.400 --> 38:42.200
FOR SALE

38:43.200 --> 38:43.900
FOR SALE

38:54.500 --> 38:56.000
Aah! Ooh!

38:56.500 --> 38:58.100
Boy, lucky
you're a good shot.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.600
But a good con man doesn't
need a gun, and he can leave...

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
Leave town whenever he wants.

39:03.200 --> 39:03.900
I know.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.500
Uh, Dad, can you get
me some Rocky Road?

39:12.500 --> 39:14.300
There's a store
around the corner.

39:14.300 --> 39:15.500
Sure thing, darling.

39:17.300 --> 39:19.000
Why did you put the
money in Chuck's account?

39:19.800 --> 39:23.100
I needed to put it somewhere
'cause I didn't trust Cop Face.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.300
But you trusted Chuck?

39:27.300 --> 39:28.200
I read people.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.700
That's the only
real talent I got.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.100
One thing I know-

39:32.000 --> 39:33.700
that kid would never betray you.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.900
I made a $10 million bet
that he loved you.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.400
Turns out I was right.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.300
I'll be back in a minute.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.100
Uh, Dad?

39:55.100 --> 39:56.900
Can you make it a double scoop?

39:58.100 --> 39:59.200
Sure, darling.

40:18.700 --> 40:19.800
Hello, Charlie.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.900
I've kind of grown accustomed
to Schnook.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
So have I.

40:25.700 --> 40:29.000
I, uh... I wanted to
thank you for coming back

40:29.400 --> 40:31.700
when I gave you ten
million reasons to leave.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.500
But one really good reason
to stay.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.200
And she would have done the same
for me.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.800
Yeah, I believe she would have.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.200
Lucky for me,
she met the right schnook.

40:56.300 --> 40:59.200
He went over there...

41:00.400 --> 41:02.900
My daughter is some
kind of cop, isn't she?

41:05.900 --> 41:07.100
Yeah. Yeah.

41:07.100 --> 41:08.100
Something like that.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.900
She turned out pretty good.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.300
Even with a lousy father.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.600
Take care of her.

41:24.100 --> 41:25.400
I'll do my best.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.300
You okay?

41:45.300 --> 41:46.400
I'm fine.

41:48.100 --> 41:48.900
Here.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.600
He'll be back soon.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.300
No, he won't.
