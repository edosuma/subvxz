00:04.894 --> 00:06.453
You think this one's suspicious too?

00:06.454 --> 00:10.013
I think everything and everyone is
suspicious, Jack. You know me.

00:10.014 --> 00:13.453
Kalan Dhana.
Pujari Pharmaceuticals.

00:13.454 --> 00:15.894
Was it my fault?
I gave him the drugs.

00:17.214 --> 00:18.653
Shh! Hey.

00:18.654 --> 00:20.934
Mr Pujari?
Vail or Hodgson?

00:20.935 --> 00:23.174
Would you mind
if we had a look around?

00:23.175 --> 00:24.654
Can I stop you?

00:24.655 --> 00:25.974
Would you want to?

00:25.975 --> 00:30.134
Young PC Steven Francis died
as a result of the vicious assault

00:30.135 --> 00:34.214
he sustained at the hands
of the two defendants.

00:34.215 --> 00:36.334
You made a mistake.
I didn't make a mistake.

00:36.335 --> 00:38.574
You have just said as much
in open court.

00:38.575 --> 00:40.174
You were wrong.

00:40.175 --> 00:42.054
The Lyell's in all sorts of trouble.

00:42.055 --> 00:44.534
This is the body of Steven Francis.

00:44.535 --> 00:46.054
Caucasian male.

00:46.055 --> 00:48.134
You better bring me the heart.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.654
You didn't find anything.

00:49.655 --> 00:52.495
No. No, we didn't.

00:52.496 --> 00:54.735
We're ready for the next stage.

00:54.736 --> 00:55.976
One more trial.

00:57.216 --> 00:58.256
Just to be sure.

01:01.056 --> 01:02.815
Is this what killed Kalan?

01:02.816 --> 01:05.015
Tell me, or I go to the police.

01:05.016 --> 01:07.015
See this?

01:07.016 --> 01:09.855
This is the body of
PC Steven Francis,

01:09.856 --> 01:13.336
and this is the heart belonging
to PC Steven Francis.

01:17.456 --> 01:19.016
I did not make a mistake.

02:20.498 --> 02:23.257
I always feel I have to come back
in the morning

02:23.258 --> 02:25.019
and pretend I've stayed the night.

02:26.699 --> 02:29.658
I can't stand the humiliation
of them knowing exactly what we've

02:29.659 --> 02:32.539
been up to...
which they probably know.

02:34.259 --> 02:37.419
I'm just talking, waffling.

02:39.179 --> 02:41.938
You are telling me the truth,
aren't you, Amanda?

02:41.939 --> 02:45.858
About what? My marriage? Us?

02:45.859 --> 02:48.218
No, no, I don't mean about that.

02:48.219 --> 02:50.659
The postmortem on PC Francis.

02:53.019 --> 02:57.579
Thomas, do you think I'd meet up
with you so you'd cover up...

02:57.580 --> 02:58.899
No, no...

02:58.900 --> 03:02.659
Is Nikki really so perfect
that she can't make a mistake?

03:02.660 --> 03:04.059
One mistake?

03:04.060 --> 03:05.499
I'm sorry. I should never...

03:05.500 --> 03:06.780
What?

03:08.860 --> 03:11.340
Asked me that question
or suggested we meet?

03:14.980 --> 03:19.699
This isn't about sex or...

03:19.700 --> 03:24.180
..the thrill of escaping this bloody
job for an afternoon or an evening.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.701
This is about love.

03:32.661 --> 03:34.381
We love each other and...

03:36.461 --> 03:38.541
..that's why it had to end,
and that's...

03:51.301 --> 03:53.860
The problem is, you're the only
person in the world

03:53.861 --> 03:55.341
I can share any of this with.

03:58.982 --> 04:00.142
I know.

04:37.103 --> 04:38.383
Hello, Leon.

04:40.703 --> 04:42.263
How do you know my name?

04:43.343 --> 04:46.102
You out early
or are you often down this way?

04:46.103 --> 04:47.983
What's it got to do with you?

04:51.983 --> 04:54.622
Rumour has it
you've got yourself a new phone.

04:54.623 --> 04:57.223
No. Who said I did?

04:59.664 --> 05:02.303
You can't see it,
not with the naked eye,

05:02.304 --> 05:05.023
but there's a satellite up there
and it's pointing down at you,

05:05.024 --> 05:07.943
and it's telling me you're using
a phone that doesn't belong to you.

05:07.944 --> 05:10.343
Bollocks.
Don't run, Leon.

05:10.344 --> 05:13.543
Please. I'm too knackered
to chase after you.

05:13.544 --> 05:15.184
But, fortunately, they're not.

05:18.824 --> 05:21.663
This is the body of
PC Steven Francis.

05:21.664 --> 05:25.223
Evidence number LY-SF-63418...

05:25.224 --> 05:26.503
When was this taken?

05:26.504 --> 05:28.343
Keep watching.

05:28.344 --> 05:31.144
..This is the heart belonging
to PC Steven Francis.

05:31.145 --> 05:34.024
Evidence number LY-SF-63418.

05:34.025 --> 05:36.064
Nikki, what the hell
is going on here?

05:36.065 --> 05:38.544
I wanted to prove that my original
findings were correct.

05:38.545 --> 05:40.984
Who are you with?
Who's taking the video?

05:40.985 --> 05:43.544
Look, Clarissa's printing out
the results.

05:43.545 --> 05:44.984
Results? What results?

05:44.985 --> 05:47.304
I took the samples to the laboratory
myself.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.264
I don't know what you're talking
about, Nikki,

05:49.265 --> 05:51.264
but this is a serious breach
of every single...

05:51.265 --> 05:53.304
Nikki did not make a mistake.

05:53.305 --> 05:55.784
Wait. This has got nothing to do
with what happened in court.

05:55.785 --> 05:57.864
She took samples from
Steven Francis's heart

05:57.865 --> 05:59.544
together with hair from his head.

05:59.545 --> 06:02.705
The two samples have been DNA tested
over the weekend,

06:02.706 --> 06:04.985
and wait for this.

06:04.986 --> 06:07.825
The heart that you and
Professor Long examined

06:07.826 --> 06:10.146
doesn't belong to PC Steven Francis.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.706
You're joking.

06:15.746 --> 06:18.545
You and Jack have checked every
procedure we do here.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.585
So have Chesham.

06:19.586 --> 06:23.345
Nikki's original PM was with
the right heart, but somehow

06:23.346 --> 06:26.705
a different heart was sent with
the body or was swapped at Chesham.

06:26.706 --> 06:28.945
What about Steven Francis's heart?
Where's that now?

06:28.946 --> 06:31.346
Morning.
They've found Kalan Dhana's phone.

06:33.787 --> 06:35.067
What did I miss this time?

06:36.227 --> 06:39.626
Continuing my interview with
Leon Birchwood.

06:39.627 --> 06:43.987
DC Vail, DC Nugent and the duty
solicitor, Mrs Alvi, in attendance.

06:45.787 --> 06:50.946
Where were we? What time did you
find the phone, Leon?

06:50.947 --> 06:53.546
I don't know. OK.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.066
From the top,
what time did you leave work?

06:56.067 --> 06:58.386
I told you, just after four.

06:58.387 --> 07:01.467
And it takes you about half
an hour to get home?

07:02.587 --> 07:05.107
Look, I was just walking that way,
down the canal,

07:05.108 --> 07:07.187
because you lot
took my driver's licence.

07:07.188 --> 07:09.907
We took it, or were you three times
over the legal limit

07:09.908 --> 07:12.187
when you were stopped
and breathalysed?

07:12.188 --> 07:13.708
You had no reason to stop me.

07:15.228 --> 07:19.627
Right. You were walking home
between 4am and 4:30am,

07:19.628 --> 07:23.467
and there was a blue sports bag
left on some cable drums.

07:23.468 --> 07:24.828
And a phone.

07:28.108 --> 07:29.708
The phone wasn't in the bag?

07:30.948 --> 07:31.987
No.

07:31.988 --> 07:34.548
It was on some cable drums?
Just sitting there?

07:34.549 --> 07:38.708
Yeah. And you didn't search
the bag, pull out some clothes,

07:38.709 --> 07:40.348
and then find the phone?

07:40.349 --> 07:41.789
No.

07:43.469 --> 07:46.748
Did this bag and this phone not
belong to someone?

07:46.749 --> 07:49.668
Did you not think,
"Ooh, that's odd"?

07:49.669 --> 07:51.708
Not down there
at that time of night!

07:51.709 --> 07:54.468
All kinds of shit kicks off.
Look, Leon,

07:54.469 --> 07:57.588
I don't give a toss about the phone.
All I'm interested in

07:57.589 --> 08:00.069
is who you may have seen
by the canal that morning.

08:03.549 --> 08:06.269
You're going to think
I was on something.

08:06.270 --> 08:08.390
Other than your son's bike,
you mean?

08:11.430 --> 08:14.949
OK, Leon says he was here.
It was dark,

08:14.950 --> 08:18.869
and he saw a phone and was looking
at what else was in the sports bag.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.389
Were the clothes in the bag?

08:20.390 --> 08:22.029
So he says.

08:22.030 --> 08:25.029
Leon then heard a noise -
some people by the water's edge -

08:25.030 --> 08:29.109
and in the water he saw
two candles floating in the dark.

08:29.110 --> 08:31.429
He didn't see a body? No.

08:31.430 --> 08:35.509
The candles then mysteriously
disappeared and he decided

08:35.510 --> 08:39.950
whoever's by the canal is probably
going to come back, so he...

08:39.951 --> 08:41.070
Legged it with the phone.

08:41.071 --> 08:44.030
Which, when he got home,
realised was crap, so didn't try

08:44.030 --> 08:46.431
and sell it or even turn it off.

08:48.791 --> 08:50.871
Yeah. OK.

08:52.751 --> 08:56.470
Oh, yeah - I got the DNA results
back from Pujari's house,

08:56.471 --> 08:58.590
the apartments
where Kalan was staying.

08:58.591 --> 09:02.590
Any evidence of those drugs
that I cannot pronounce? No.

09:02.591 --> 09:05.550
I guess that was to be expected.
Perhaps.

09:05.551 --> 09:08.232
But there's one thing
I didn't expect to find. Oh, yeah?

09:09.392 --> 09:13.071
There was no evidence of Kalan
Dhana's DNA anywhere in that room.

09:13.072 --> 09:14.711
But that's where he lived.

09:14.712 --> 09:16.472
That's where we were TOLD he lived.

09:22.512 --> 09:23.792
Where's Jenna?

09:26.632 --> 09:28.112
She's on her way.

09:41.353 --> 09:42.992
You and I both know that the variant

09:42.993 --> 09:45.193
is still years away from being
ready for market.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.512
We were told to take
as long as it took.

09:50.513 --> 09:52.152
This is important work.

09:52.153 --> 09:55.992
But there's another use for it,
that Mr Pujari would like to

09:55.993 --> 09:59.272
explore... that's not strictly legal.

09:59.273 --> 10:00.752
What other use?

10:00.753 --> 10:04.312
And the money he earns from that
will be poured back into our trials.

10:04.313 --> 10:08.073
Kalan's death has put us
months behind.

10:10.634 --> 10:12.114
Does Jenna know all this?

10:14.394 --> 10:16.394
The less people who know,
the better.

10:22.754 --> 10:24.034
Did Kalan know?

10:26.714 --> 10:29.953
Of course he did -
he wrote it all down here.

10:29.954 --> 10:31.194
See for yourself.

10:32.354 --> 10:33.633
See for yourself.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.314
Details of the trial.
Expected outcomes.

10:45.635 --> 10:46.995
Richard?

10:52.195 --> 10:53.915
I'm sorry, Jacob.

10:55.875 --> 10:58.674
Hi. Hi.
It was lovely to see you last night.

10:58.675 --> 11:00.634
I've missed you.
You want to have a look at this.

11:00.635 --> 11:02.834
I thought when I got your message
this morning...

11:02.835 --> 11:04.435
I'm sorry, Amanda, this is urgent.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.834
Either there's been
some sort of mistake

11:07.835 --> 11:09.515
or the heart's been swapped somehow.

11:11.676 --> 11:14.995
I can assure you, Thomas, the heart
wasn't swapped at Chesham.

11:14.996 --> 11:18.515
And I can assure you, Amanda,
it wasn't swapped at The Lyell.

11:18.516 --> 11:21.595
Earlier this year
we had an attempted break-in.

11:21.596 --> 11:23.195
I told you about it. Yes.

11:23.196 --> 11:24.715
Yes, well, as a result,

11:24.716 --> 11:27.995
we had extra security cameras placed
in almost every department.

11:27.996 --> 11:30.715
So, if something like this had
happened, it would have been seen.

11:30.716 --> 11:32.875
So, you've checked the tapes? Yeah?

11:32.876 --> 11:35.315
Are you serious? Well, look,

11:35.316 --> 11:37.035
I know it wasn't us. How unusual!

11:37.036 --> 11:39.435
Dr Thomas Chamberlain trying
to shift the blame.

11:39.436 --> 11:41.795
I'm not trying to shift anything.
If The Lyell is at fault,

11:41.796 --> 11:44.596
I'll be the first to take
full responsibility. Yeah.

11:44.597 --> 11:46.836
Because you're
so bloody good at that, aren't you?

11:46.837 --> 11:49.076
Amanda, we have to keep
our personal relationship...

11:49.077 --> 11:52.116
Of course we must.
Must be professional.

11:52.117 --> 11:53.197
Above all else.

12:28.198 --> 12:30.997
Jenna, have you heard from him?
No. What about you?

12:30.998 --> 12:33.917
Nothing.
I've sent at least ten messages.

12:33.918 --> 12:35.237
I'm getting really worried.

12:35.238 --> 12:37.157
Have you got any more texts
from Jacob?

12:37.158 --> 12:38.717
No, no.

12:38.718 --> 12:40.397
Why the hell didn't he talk to me?

12:40.398 --> 12:42.997
He's too angry. So it's my fault?

12:42.998 --> 12:45.638
He's angry with you and upset
about what happened to Kalan.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.439
He felt betrayed. I know.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.559
I wanted to tell the truth,
but Pujari wouldn't let me.

12:52.759 --> 12:54.438
I really hope nothing bad has
happened.

12:54.439 --> 12:56.759
Have you spoken to Mr Pujari?
No. No.

12:58.399 --> 13:01.238
If you hear anything,
or Jacob texts you again,

13:01.239 --> 13:04.119
you call me immediately, yes?
Yes. Of course.

13:07.199 --> 13:08.359
I love you, Jenna.

13:10.079 --> 13:11.079
OK.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.201
Hiya.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.722
I'm sorry I doubted you.

14:21.682 --> 14:23.202
This shouldn't be about me.

14:24.642 --> 14:27.482
You looked at the evidence
and you believed what you saw.

14:29.242 --> 14:32.281
You were right, though,
I did feel undermined.

14:32.282 --> 14:33.562
Yeah.

14:39.842 --> 14:41.442
Have you spoken to Amanda Long?

14:42.602 --> 14:45.922
Yeah, yeah. She should be here.

14:57.883 --> 15:02.003
Professor Long, what exactly
do you put this error down to?

15:02.963 --> 15:05.802
Well, we have both looked
at our procedures,

15:05.803 --> 15:07.722
the keeping and logging of evidence.

15:07.723 --> 15:10.362
Might it have just been an accident
of some kind?

15:10.363 --> 15:14.602
In my opinion, the most credible
explanation is sabotage.

15:14.603 --> 15:19.243
A heart belonging to one body was
swapped with the heart belonging to

15:19.244 --> 15:22.483
another, with the purpose
of sabotaging the evidence

15:22.484 --> 15:24.403
and the subsequent trial.

15:24.404 --> 15:27.683
That is a very serious accusation.

15:27.684 --> 15:30.203
Do you have any idea
who would want to do this?

15:30.204 --> 15:32.123
My findings were categoric.

15:32.124 --> 15:36.283
PC Francis had an undetected heart
condition. After the hearts

15:36.284 --> 15:39.563
were swapped, Professor Long found
that the heart was healthy.

15:39.564 --> 15:43.203
Clearly that would have an effect
on the outcome of the trial.

15:43.204 --> 15:46.444
Are you suggesting the police had
a hand in this?

15:47.964 --> 15:49.363
I have no idea.

15:49.364 --> 15:51.885
There are a number of people
who would have had access.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.724
Including us.

15:54.725 --> 15:57.604
Do you agree that this was
a deliberate act?

15:57.605 --> 16:00.925
An act of sabotage,
as Dr Alexander has put it?

16:02.485 --> 16:03.725
I do. Yes.

16:05.485 --> 16:08.204
Well, it would seem that way. Yes.

16:08.205 --> 16:10.245
This is a very serious matter.

16:11.645 --> 16:14.244
We obviously can't continue
with this trial.

16:14.245 --> 16:15.844
Yes, my lord.

16:15.845 --> 16:17.284
When the jury return,

16:17.285 --> 16:20.605
we will be formally asking you
to discharge them.

16:21.926 --> 16:24.525
My lord, we will want
to address you on that.

16:24.526 --> 16:27.126
Yes, I can see that you might.

16:28.806 --> 16:34.325
This fiasco must be
investigated thoroughly

16:34.326 --> 16:37.005
at the highest level.

16:37.006 --> 16:40.726
I will make that clear in court
and write in person to the coroner.

16:41.926 --> 16:45.725
The evidence from PC Steven
Francis's body will need to

16:45.726 --> 16:49.965
be located, and two new postmortems
carried out by pathologists

16:49.966 --> 16:55.087
from establishments other than
Chesham or The Lyell.

17:00.927 --> 17:04.445
I feel I owe you an apology, but...

17:04.446 --> 17:06.046
I don't expect you to. Why would...

17:06.047 --> 17:08.445
You know I hold you
in high regard, Nikki.

17:08.446 --> 17:09.926
The feeling's mutual.

17:10.847 --> 17:15.766
I was wrong to say what I did
after you gave evidence.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.086
I handled that situation poorly.
I'm sorry.

17:19.087 --> 17:21.886
I'm not used to people feeling
sorry for me,

17:21.887 --> 17:26.367
not professionally anyway.
I imagine you feel the same.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.447
So, the trial of two men
accused of murdering a police

17:29.448 --> 17:31.687
officer has been abandoned
on our watch.

17:31.688 --> 17:33.288
We'd better get back.

17:43.848 --> 17:46.247
A retrial, can you believe it?

17:46.248 --> 17:49.087
At least Dr Alexander has been
exonerated.

17:49.088 --> 17:52.687
Has she? We have CCTV footage of
those two men punching

17:52.688 --> 17:56.528
and kicking the life out
of PC Francis. Both have a history

17:56.529 --> 17:59.168
of causing GBH and ABH, and both
have admitted violent assault.

17:59.169 --> 18:01.849
We had all that evidence, but
we still can't get a conviction.

18:03.489 --> 18:06.768
Have you, by any chance, got to have
a look at the DNA samples

18:06.769 --> 18:08.808
from the Pujari apartments?

18:08.809 --> 18:11.688
Tell me again, Jack, what you found
exactly? Nothing.

18:11.689 --> 18:15.088
But isn't that, in itself,
suspicious, ma'am?

18:15.089 --> 18:16.608
It might be suspicious.

18:16.609 --> 18:19.728
But, then again, it might
just be some kind of mistake.

18:19.729 --> 18:22.088
They're running the samples
again to make sure, but...

18:22.089 --> 18:24.328
This whole thing has been staged.

18:24.329 --> 18:27.769
The clothing, the finding of the
lanyard, the way they spoke to me.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.649
Even Arthur Pujari going on about
some old tree. Right, look.

18:30.650 --> 18:34.049
It's suspicious. But without
concrete, verifiable forensics -

18:34.050 --> 18:36.769
no offence, Jack -
it's still not a murder inquiry.

18:36.770 --> 18:38.009
Yep.

18:38.010 --> 18:41.249
Kalan Dhana may have taken
those drugs of his own free will,

18:41.250 --> 18:43.089
taken out a canoe and fallen asleep

18:43.090 --> 18:46.130
with a couple of candles on his
stomach. Best get back to work, eh?

18:48.690 --> 18:50.489
So, we need more.

18:50.490 --> 18:52.530
When have we ever needed less?

18:55.050 --> 18:58.010
If anyone's set this thing up,
it's Arthur Pujari.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.250
What more can we find
to convince Briggs?

19:00.251 --> 19:01.930
Look...

19:01.931 --> 19:04.330
..I really appreciate
what you've done on this.

19:04.331 --> 19:06.370
It's not over till it's over.

19:06.371 --> 19:08.450
I'll go back and see Arthur Pujari

19:08.451 --> 19:10.811
and talk to some of those colleagues
of Kalan's again.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.770
What if we go back to where Kalan
and Jacob were living,

19:15.771 --> 19:18.410
and you test every room?

19:18.411 --> 19:20.250
All the rooms looked spotless to me,

19:20.251 --> 19:22.250
like they were laboratories
themselves.

19:22.251 --> 19:25.210
If they were responsible, how did
they get the body in the canal?

19:25.211 --> 19:27.811
None of them owned a car,
Clarissa checked.

19:27.812 --> 19:29.811
Did they borrow one? Hire one?

19:29.812 --> 19:31.891
Use one of Arthur Pujari's?

19:31.892 --> 19:33.531
I know Clarissa was looking into it,

19:33.532 --> 19:35.892
but she's been somewhat sidetracked.
We all have.

19:37.492 --> 19:38.851
Events.

19:38.852 --> 19:40.171
Yeah.

19:40.172 --> 19:41.771
Events.

19:41.772 --> 19:43.251
Another one?

19:43.252 --> 19:45.212
No, thanks. I'd better get back.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.012
See you.

19:53.972 --> 19:55.851
That's when Steven Francis came in.

19:55.852 --> 19:59.092
The signatures of the funeral
director, Greg signed it in,

19:59.093 --> 20:01.372
and I countersigned it
when it came upstairs.

20:01.373 --> 20:04.972
The bar codes zapped and logged.
You can see the entry times.

20:04.973 --> 20:07.692
This is all when -
Friday the 11th, yeah?

20:07.693 --> 20:11.612
Nikki did the PM on the Monday.
She removed the heart

20:11.613 --> 20:13.412
and took samples from it.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.092
Yes. I can see that.

20:16.093 --> 20:19.012
The samples were sent off by Alice
and, once Nikki had finished,

20:19.013 --> 20:22.732
the body was sewn up
and returned to the fridge.

20:22.733 --> 20:23.773
OK.

20:24.773 --> 20:28.052
So, the heart is put into
a container of formalin by Nikki.

20:28.053 --> 20:30.533
Who, then, put that container
into the fridge?

20:30.534 --> 20:32.493
According to the log...

20:32.494 --> 20:33.853
..it was Greg.

20:33.854 --> 20:37.093
Then how long before the heart and
the body are moved on to Chesham?

20:37.094 --> 20:42.254
They were with us for 11 days
before being sent for the second PM.

20:43.694 --> 20:45.253
11 days.

20:45.254 --> 20:47.453
So, certainly enough time
for Francis's heart

20:47.454 --> 20:49.334
to be switched with a healthy one.
Yes.

20:53.014 --> 20:54.253
You want a tea or something?

20:54.254 --> 20:55.414
Nothing, thanks.

20:58.654 --> 21:00.134
It's going well, then.

21:00.135 --> 21:03.255
Just an iceberg, Captain.
Nothing to worry about.

21:05.295 --> 21:07.374
Tell me more about Arthur Pujari.

21:07.375 --> 21:09.374
I thought you knew all about him.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.934
So did I, until I started looking
into what the drugs

21:11.935 --> 21:13.934
found in Kalan's body
might be used for.

21:13.935 --> 21:15.094
Like what?

21:15.095 --> 21:19.694
One's a dissociative anaesthetic,
the other's a muscle relaxant.

21:19.695 --> 21:23.174
In combination, they're potentially
extremely dangerous.

21:23.175 --> 21:25.854
I thought they were developing
a non-addictive painkiller.

21:25.855 --> 21:29.494
Ketamine, it's fast-acting,
it's non-addictive,

21:29.495 --> 21:34.215
but the vecuronium bromide?
The ketamine just makes it stronger.

21:34.216 --> 21:39.855
Kalan's hearing aids were paid for
by a shell company

21:39.856 --> 21:41.615
in the Cayman Islands.

21:41.616 --> 21:43.455
Owned by Pujari?

21:43.456 --> 21:45.935
That's the beauty of shell
companies.

21:45.936 --> 21:48.055
They tend not to tell you
who actually owns them,

21:48.056 --> 21:49.775
runs them or takes profits
from them.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.455
Or who's trying to hide
their tax liabilities.

21:52.456 --> 21:55.455
Particularly from
"man of the people" Arthur Pujari.

21:55.456 --> 21:59.815
Mm. Who openly attacks big companies
for not paying their dues.

21:59.816 --> 22:04.297
This shell company has a series
of subsidiaries in America.

22:05.377 --> 22:07.097
Texas, Florida, Alabama.

22:08.217 --> 22:10.737
What do you think that means?
I'm not sure.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.377
Yet.

22:23.377 --> 22:25.136
Jack, we've found another body.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.576
Who is it?

22:26.577 --> 22:27.977
Jacob Nduka.

22:53.418 --> 22:54.818
Shit.

22:56.138 --> 22:58.258
You make a judgment call
and sometimes...

23:09.419 --> 23:10.699
Ready to bring him down?

23:18.979 --> 23:20.698
Is that a suicide note?

23:20.699 --> 23:23.818
Even if it is a suicide note, that
doesn't mean that it's a suicide.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.138
I know that, Detective Constable.

23:26.139 --> 23:28.858
When we get him back to The Lyell,
we'll be able to examine...

23:28.859 --> 23:31.338
You're still open for business,
then?

23:31.339 --> 23:33.978
I heard DCI Dermot Flanagan
was heading your way.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.419
Nothing's been confirmed,
as far as I know.

23:36.420 --> 23:39.579
Well, when Flanagan does get there,
you'll soon know about it.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.459
It's a confession.

23:41.460 --> 23:42.740
To what?

23:50.900 --> 23:54.620
"Kalan and I were working secretly
on drug trials.

23:56.500 --> 24:00.139
"We wanted to speed up the process
and get ahead of the competition..."

24:00.140 --> 24:02.580
..so we tested
the drugs on ourselves.

24:04.540 --> 24:08.701
One night, Kalan died after
I injected him with a new drug.

24:13.421 --> 24:15.141
I'm so ashamed.

24:18.261 --> 24:23.061
I am so sorry to my family
for disgracing them in this way.

24:25.541 --> 24:28.781
I know I'm going to hell,
and that's only right.

24:31.821 --> 24:33.461
I'm so sorry.

24:50.622 --> 24:53.661
Apparent venepuncture marks

24:53.662 --> 24:55.502
on his right...

24:58.342 --> 25:01.022
..yes, and left anticubital fossae.

25:04.942 --> 25:08.823
Petechial haemorrhaging
in and around the eyes.

25:10.063 --> 25:14.143
Cyanosis on the lips. Both
consistent with asphyxial death.

25:15.823 --> 25:18.423
As is this ligature mark
around his neck...

25:19.783 --> 25:21.343
..rising posteriorly.

25:29.903 --> 25:33.023
No fingermarks or other obvious
signs of trauma here.

25:36.863 --> 25:38.783
These are his X-rays, yeah?

25:41.384 --> 25:45.103
The upper cervical vertebrae
seem intact.

25:45.104 --> 25:47.583
Alice, have you got the photos
taken at the scene?

25:47.584 --> 25:49.584
Yes. Thank you.

25:53.984 --> 25:57.864
Given the height of the drop,
if he'd jumped or been pushed...

25:59.504 --> 26:01.664
..I'd expect his neck
to have been broken.

26:03.384 --> 26:05.343
And here's an interesting thing.

26:05.344 --> 26:09.863
In a hanging death, you get lividity
in the feet, the fingertips,

26:09.864 --> 26:11.904
the ear lobes. The blood pooling

26:11.905 --> 26:15.545
in the lowest areas possible
after death. There's some here...

26:17.905 --> 26:19.985
..but nowhere near as much
as I'd expect.

26:21.105 --> 26:22.825
Right, let's open him up.

26:28.265 --> 26:33.785
Plume of froth, similar to Kalan -
another acute pulmonary oedema?

26:36.065 --> 26:38.624
Kalan was dead
before he entered the canal.

26:38.625 --> 26:41.146
I believe this man died
before he was hanged.

26:42.906 --> 26:45.305
We need tox screening
as soon as possible.

26:45.306 --> 26:47.305
Thomas? It's the coroner.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.785
He said it was urgent.

26:48.786 --> 26:50.426
On my way.

27:15.827 --> 27:18.146
If it's not at Chesham, then it has
to be someone here.

27:18.147 --> 27:20.026
How do you know it's not someone at
Chesham?

27:20.027 --> 27:21.667
I saw Amanda last night.
She told me.

27:23.827 --> 27:25.387
Are you two...?

27:26.907 --> 27:29.666
Thomas! Nikki, this is not the time.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.666
Why didn't you tell me,
at least give me a heads-up?

27:32.667 --> 27:35.346
It has nothing to do with the case.

27:35.347 --> 27:37.106
I believed you, you know that.

27:37.107 --> 27:40.227
And I believed her because
the evidence told me to.

27:47.268 --> 27:48.507
I'm sorry.

27:48.508 --> 27:50.787
I should have let you know.

27:50.788 --> 27:52.548
I'll leave you to it.

27:59.508 --> 28:01.387
Amanda?

28:01.388 --> 28:03.507
I've made a decision.

28:03.508 --> 28:06.427
Or rather our lawyers have made
a decision.

28:06.428 --> 28:07.708
Right?

28:09.228 --> 28:12.228
I am talking about work, not us. Oh.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.948
I've been advised that we should get
an independent investigator.

28:17.949 --> 28:20.308
Yes, yes,
I've already spoken to the coroner.

28:20.309 --> 28:22.148
It's a criminal investigation now -

28:22.149 --> 28:23.908
perverting the course of justice.

28:23.909 --> 28:26.108
He's appointed a senior
police officer

28:26.109 --> 28:28.228
not connected to
the PC Francis case.

28:28.229 --> 28:30.669
Right. Well, I await the call.

28:31.789 --> 28:32.829
I...

28:34.389 --> 28:36.348
..wonder, what would you do
if I said

28:36.349 --> 28:38.309
I was leaving Robert to be with you?

28:39.869 --> 28:41.149
Um...

28:43.029 --> 28:44.469
I thought as much.

28:58.430 --> 29:01.669
It strikes me as one of the great
chemical ironies,

29:01.670 --> 29:04.309
that a drug used
in life-saving surgery

29:04.310 --> 29:07.510
is so prevalent in the medical
profession as a means of suicide.

29:08.710 --> 29:10.509
Vecuronium bromide.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.749
You think Jacob and Kalan
killed themselves?

29:12.750 --> 29:16.510
No, no. I don't.
Jacob clearly didn't hang himself.

29:16.511 --> 29:19.310
From the start, that's
what we were meant to think, but...

29:19.311 --> 29:22.590
..here, look - the tox report.

29:22.591 --> 29:24.110
What about it?

29:24.111 --> 29:27.710
Along with a tranquiliser,
Jacob had ketamine and vecuronium

29:27.711 --> 29:31.350
in his body, but the dosages weren't
enough to kill him.

29:31.351 --> 29:33.910
The noose he hung from
didn't kill him.

29:33.911 --> 29:36.190
So, what did?

29:36.191 --> 29:37.830
There may be another drug.

29:37.831 --> 29:39.871
A drug we're not meant to find.

29:40.911 --> 29:41.950
OK.

29:41.951 --> 29:45.110
Let's extend the screening. Test
the brain tissue for metabolites.

29:45.111 --> 29:48.071
Thomas, what were these brilliant
young men doing

29:48.072 --> 29:50.511
putting all this shit
into their bodies?

29:50.512 --> 29:52.352
Visit Pujari, ask him.

30:23.193 --> 30:26.473
Right, I'll see what Vail and I can
find at Jacob and Kalan's place.

30:28.153 --> 30:30.672
Now, who lives in a house like this?

30:30.673 --> 30:32.633
Hm.

30:34.593 --> 30:36.272
Are you going to behave yourself?

30:36.273 --> 30:37.793
What do YOU think?

30:47.753 --> 30:50.793
Clarissa Mullery. Mr Pujari.

30:50.794 --> 30:52.474
Please, come with me.

31:23.155 --> 31:28.075
So, Miss Mullery, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

31:30.155 --> 31:35.315
Jacob and Kalan were secretly
working on a new drug.

31:36.635 --> 31:38.635
According to Jacob's suicide note.

31:41.035 --> 31:42.395
It happens.

31:43.395 --> 31:46.275
Some people like to stay ahead
of the game.

31:47.235 --> 31:50.074
But what game were they
trying to stay ahead of?

31:50.075 --> 31:54.355
I thought Kalan was working
on a non-addictive painkiller?

31:54.356 --> 31:57.955
That's all the information I have,
I'm afraid.

31:57.956 --> 32:00.035
Do you condone what they were doing?

32:00.036 --> 32:04.915
Running trials without protocols,
without safety standards,

32:04.916 --> 32:06.516
on your premises?

32:08.356 --> 32:12.475
As Miss World says,
all I want is world peace

32:12.476 --> 32:15.275
and global access
to free health care.

32:15.276 --> 32:18.235
Please, try the cake.

32:18.236 --> 32:20.595
Cook baked it this morning.

32:20.596 --> 32:24.356
Two of your researchers
have been found dead.

32:24.357 --> 32:27.436
Both had a ketamine variant
in their bodies.

32:27.437 --> 32:31.436
Both had vecuronium bromide
swimming around as well.

32:31.437 --> 32:34.357
But do you know what else we found
in Jacob's body?

32:35.637 --> 32:38.276
Evidence of succinylcholine.

32:38.277 --> 32:41.636
It's normally untraceable,
but we found it.

32:41.637 --> 32:43.756
We were meant to think it
was suicide.

32:43.757 --> 32:45.556
But it wasn't.

32:45.557 --> 32:48.037
Jacob died a very painful death,
Mr Pujari.

32:49.597 --> 32:51.676
That's truly shocking.

32:51.677 --> 32:53.038
Poor boy.

32:55.038 --> 32:56.918
Jack? In here.

33:01.918 --> 33:04.877
They've asked us to leave,
come back with a search warrant.

33:04.878 --> 33:06.837
I thought we'd permission
to be here.

33:06.838 --> 33:08.837
We did, but now it's been withdrawn.

33:08.838 --> 33:11.518
That wouldn't stop the likes
of you now, would it, PC Vail?

33:12.998 --> 33:16.238
Listen, I think this is where
the experiments may have happened.

33:17.718 --> 33:20.958
How do you know? A bed of some kind
was here, in the middle. See?

33:22.078 --> 33:24.559
Swab this stain, see what we get.

33:26.919 --> 33:28.399
Won't take long.

33:36.919 --> 33:40.038
Yes. I'm sorry about that.

33:40.039 --> 33:43.758
The company lawyers are telling me
that I have to ask you to leave.

33:43.759 --> 33:48.718
The same lawyers that helped you set
up a shell company in the Caymans

33:48.719 --> 33:53.638
that paid over ã100,000
for Kalan's implants?

33:53.639 --> 33:58.599
A company with subsidiaries
in Georgia, Florida, Texas...

33:58.600 --> 34:04.759
Ms Mullery... Why would you want
to mask your operations

34:04.760 --> 34:06.480
in the southern states of America?

34:07.960 --> 34:11.799
Cos you were planning to sell
the drug to American prisons

34:11.800 --> 34:14.400
for use on prisoners facing
execution.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.119
That's quite a leap for a scientist.

34:22.120 --> 34:25.679
But, before you start making
insinuations against me

34:25.679 --> 34:28.639
and my company, perhaps
you should have some proof?

34:28.641 --> 34:33.480
Two men died in order to get your
drug to market. A drug used

34:33.481 --> 34:36.760
to inject condemned prisoners so
they won't move

34:36.761 --> 34:40.440
as they're being executed,
and not for the prisoners' sake

34:40.440 --> 34:42.560
but for those who have to watch.

34:42.561 --> 34:46.801
A drug that is illegal to export
from the UK.

34:49.161 --> 34:51.120
What a great mind.

34:51.121 --> 34:54.520
Maybe you should come work for me
one day.

34:54.521 --> 34:57.521
Just explain this.

34:57.522 --> 35:03.121
The presence of formaldehyde
in Kalan's body.

35:03.122 --> 35:05.001
An embalming drug.

35:05.002 --> 35:09.041
I know what's going on at The Lyell
and we both know, in court,

35:09.042 --> 35:12.881
this would be considered
a mistake at best.

35:12.882 --> 35:14.721
Inadmissible...

35:14.722 --> 35:16.002
..at worse.

35:18.362 --> 35:22.521
It must be so frustrating
to know you're right,

35:22.522 --> 35:25.361
but that no-one believes you.

35:25.362 --> 35:26.922
Binni!

35:29.923 --> 35:33.442
Could you make sure Ms Mullery finds
her way to the front door.

35:33.443 --> 35:34.683
Thank you.

36:02.484 --> 36:03.923
Hello.

36:03.924 --> 36:05.683
Please tell me you found something.

36:05.684 --> 36:06.963
But of course.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.763
A stain, sent off for analysis,

36:08.764 --> 36:12.203
and evidence of a bed in the middle
of the living room.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.923
That's probably where they ran the
experiments. Probably.

36:14.924 --> 36:18.883
These young people were testing
the new drug on themselves.

36:18.884 --> 36:20.803
Did Arthur Pujari confirm that?

36:20.804 --> 36:23.923
He did more than that -
he dared me to prove it.

36:23.924 --> 36:27.084
He DARED you? Yeah.
Wow, are you still a fan?

36:28.484 --> 36:30.564
Is that Kalan's phone? Yes.

36:30.565 --> 36:34.604
He was using a storage app
to hold a shedload of data.

36:34.605 --> 36:35.964
From these drug trials?

36:35.965 --> 36:38.044
I'm still trying to access it.

36:38.045 --> 36:40.124
Do not suggest I call Max.

36:40.125 --> 36:41.444
Wouldn't dream of it.

36:41.445 --> 36:43.245
I've already tried him.

36:46.085 --> 36:47.764
Now, this is interesting.

36:47.765 --> 36:51.405
So, Kalan's login to the app
has been blocked.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.685
And his files deleted.

36:55.725 --> 36:59.604
But if I can partly restore this...

36:59.605 --> 37:03.526
..we can rebuild him.
We have the technology.

37:05.006 --> 37:07.125
Details from the testing programme.

37:07.126 --> 37:08.645
Dates.

37:08.646 --> 37:10.085
Times.

37:10.086 --> 37:13.085
The ketamine variant,
the placebo...

37:13.086 --> 37:18.045
At least four participants were
involved in each of the tests,

37:18.046 --> 37:21.805
as administrator,
observer or guinea pig.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.965
And I bet we can guess which four.

37:23.966 --> 37:27.645
They've been working on these
trials for over two years.

37:27.646 --> 37:28.885
Long time.

37:28.886 --> 37:31.565
Pujari must have known about this.

37:31.566 --> 37:34.086
How else were they being funded?

37:34.087 --> 37:37.646
And who was all this data for,
if not for him? Hm.

37:37.647 --> 37:41.566
That's not going to prove
who killed Jacob, though, is it? No.

37:41.567 --> 37:43.807
No, but there are more files here
that might.

38:07.568 --> 38:08.927
KNOCK ON DOOR

38:08.928 --> 38:09.968
Yeah?

38:11.488 --> 38:15.088
Hi. Sorry, I just brought you
some coffee. Oh, thanks.

38:16.448 --> 38:19.287
Thomas said you were preparing
for a trial.

38:19.288 --> 38:21.047
Yeah, it's a murder conviction

38:21.048 --> 38:23.168
that's up before
the Court of Appeal.

38:25.528 --> 38:29.247
Nikki, I was just wondering...
Yeah?

38:29.248 --> 38:32.047
It's just I've learned so much from
watching yourself and Thomas

38:32.048 --> 38:35.649
in the mortuary, but going to court
would scare the life out of me.

38:37.209 --> 38:41.648
You just have to know what you're
saying, and what you're saying

38:41.649 --> 38:45.008
is clear and is true
to the best of your knowledge.

38:45.009 --> 38:46.528
Thanks.

38:46.529 --> 38:48.288
And this is the case?

38:48.289 --> 38:49.848
Yes.

38:49.849 --> 38:52.008
It's another failure in disclosure.

38:52.009 --> 38:55.488
The victim's GP has recently
revealed that the deceased

38:55.489 --> 38:57.849
had early-stage multiple sclerosis.

38:59.449 --> 39:01.288
Would that have changed the verdict?

39:01.289 --> 39:03.889
In my view, no.

39:04.970 --> 39:08.010
Mrs Coulter was beaten...

39:09.610 --> 39:12.289
..and stamped on by her husband,

39:12.290 --> 39:16.650
and he threw her down the stairs,
making it look like an accident.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.249
And he was found guilty?

39:21.250 --> 39:24.289
He was. 18 years,
I think he got.

39:24.290 --> 39:26.729
Because of your testimony?
Maybe.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.969
But who knows what the jury think?

39:28.970 --> 39:32.409
What they weren't told was that he'd
attacked her previously.

39:32.410 --> 39:34.729
He put her in hospital
with a broken jaw,

39:34.730 --> 39:37.010
but it was deemed
inadmissible at the time,

39:37.011 --> 39:39.851
because the judge thought it was
unduly prejudicial.

39:41.331 --> 39:44.370
And now you have to do this
all over again.

39:44.371 --> 39:46.410
You must get so nervous.

39:46.411 --> 39:48.050
It's like anything, really.

39:48.051 --> 39:50.330
The more you do it,
the better you get.

39:50.331 --> 39:54.371
But all those people watching you?
All those expectations?

39:56.211 --> 39:57.571
It's not just that.

39:59.171 --> 40:03.371
There are some barristers who...
How shall I put it?

40:05.251 --> 40:08.251
..aren't interested in what
happened,

40:08.252 --> 40:10.131
or in the human beings involved.

40:10.132 --> 40:14.091
They aren't interested in trying
to establish the facts.

40:14.092 --> 40:16.731
They spend their entire time trying
to get me

40:16.732 --> 40:20.971
to fit my evidence to their
narrative of what may have happened.

40:20.972 --> 40:23.651
"You say the world is round,
Dr Alexander,

40:23.652 --> 40:26.211
"but isn't that just your opinion?"

40:26.212 --> 40:31.411
The pattern of neuropathology shows
what's called coup type injuries.

40:31.412 --> 40:34.531
Yes, to the back
of Mrs Coulter's head.

40:34.532 --> 40:38.092
This is caused when a moving object
strikes the head.

40:38.093 --> 40:44.172
Isn't that their job, though - to
question you, question what you say?

40:44.173 --> 40:46.092
Of course.
To question the science

40:46.093 --> 40:48.372
and the interpretation of that
science.

40:48.373 --> 40:51.972
As with this case - falls
and injuries like these

40:51.973 --> 40:54.692
are always open to interpretation.

40:54.693 --> 40:58.852
And when there are no witnesses
or CCTV, it can be almost impossible

40:58.853 --> 41:02.092
to prove what happened with
100% certainty.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.333
But you're certain?

41:05.453 --> 41:07.853
Sorry, I'm just trying to help.

41:09.294 --> 41:13.213
I was as certain as I could be
at the original trial,

41:13.214 --> 41:16.094
and looking at these...

41:17.414 --> 41:19.533
..and going through my report,

41:19.534 --> 41:22.253
I'm even more certain now.

41:22.254 --> 41:24.254
Can I refer you to exhibit 5?

41:27.214 --> 41:30.373
I'll draw you what I'm going to say
in court, if you like.

41:30.374 --> 41:32.053
You can see if it's clear.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.133
In a fall onto the back of the head,

41:34.134 --> 41:37.973
we see contrecoup injury
to the opposite side of the brain.

41:37.974 --> 41:40.774
The key is to be as clear
as possible

41:40.775 --> 41:44.375
for the judges to understand
what is quite technical...

41:46.535 --> 41:48.175
Here's a skull.

41:49.335 --> 41:53.014
Obviously they'll be better
diagrams for the court,

41:53.015 --> 41:57.455
but this will give you an idea.
A coup injury occurs...

41:58.975 --> 42:02.615
..under the site of impact with an
object.

42:05.815 --> 42:09.934
And a contrecoup injury occurs...

42:09.935 --> 42:16.135
..on the opposite side
of the area that was hit.

42:16.136 --> 42:19.255
As the court will know,
a coup injury occurs

42:19.256 --> 42:22.175
under the site of impact
with an object.

42:22.176 --> 42:27.815
A contrecoup injury occurs on the
side opposite the area that was hit.

42:27.816 --> 42:33.215
Coup and contrecoup injuries are
cerebral contusions -

42:33.216 --> 42:35.335
bruising to the brain.

42:35.336 --> 42:38.455
They can occur individually
or together.

42:38.456 --> 42:41.815
When a moving object impacts
the stationary head,

42:41.816 --> 42:44.176
coup injuries are typical,

42:44.177 --> 42:46.696
while contrecoup
injuries are produced

42:46.697 --> 42:49.816
when the moving head strikes
a stationary object.

42:49.817 --> 42:53.656
Now, this evidence can be open
to interpretation

42:53.657 --> 42:58.776
but, in the end, the head injuries
form only a part of what happened.

42:58.777 --> 43:02.456
The left shoulder blade -
this was fractured in several

43:02.457 --> 43:04.936
places, which is just not typical

43:04.937 --> 43:07.336
of a simple fall down the stairs.

43:07.337 --> 43:09.936
What do you mean?

43:09.937 --> 43:13.737
Well, if it didn't happen when
Mrs Coulter went down the stairs,

43:13.738 --> 43:16.897
then it must have happened
either before or after -

43:16.898 --> 43:20.457
suggesting
that she had been assaulted.

43:20.458 --> 43:21.778
How can you be sure?

43:23.098 --> 43:27.497
The way the shoulder's fractured
and the way the bruising

43:27.498 --> 43:31.577
appears and, as I say,
she had been stamped on before.

43:31.578 --> 43:35.537
Uh, Nikki, um, have you got
a moment?

43:35.538 --> 43:36.938
Sure.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.377
Shall I print this out for you?

43:43.378 --> 43:46.059
Uh, yeah, that would be great.
Thanks.

43:52.539 --> 43:56.259
These are results from samples that
we sent off two days ago.

43:57.739 --> 43:59.138
What? There.

43:59.139 --> 44:02.538
Jacob Nduka's sample has DNA
from PC Steven Francis?

44:02.539 --> 44:03.938
Yeah.

44:03.939 --> 44:05.499
This is out of control.

44:06.579 --> 44:11.458
Fractures to the right shoulder were
found in both X-rays and dissection

44:11.459 --> 44:16.019
of the back. There was extensive
haemorrhage in the soft tissues.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.939
The RIGHT shoulder?

44:17.940 --> 44:20.739
In the original trial
and in these photos,

44:20.740 --> 44:22.660
it's clearly the left shoulder.

44:29.460 --> 44:31.179
Sorry, I meant the left.

44:31.180 --> 44:35.819
It's the severity of the fractures
that makes these injuries notable.

44:35.820 --> 44:38.339
The first fracture to the head,
Doctor, you said

44:38.340 --> 44:39.980
it occurred at the back.

44:42.660 --> 44:46.221
Yes. Again, at the original trial,
you said it was to the right side.

45:03.461 --> 45:05.060
Yes.

45:05.061 --> 45:06.580
Yes.

45:06.581 --> 45:10.180
Yes? Yes what? You were wrong then
but you're right now,

45:10.181 --> 45:12.820
or you're wrong now
and were right then?

45:12.821 --> 45:15.220
Or, as I suggest, Dr Alexander,
you were wrong then

45:15.221 --> 45:17.142
AND are wrong now?

45:20.142 --> 45:23.981
Mrs Coulter was hit on the side
of the head - it was a hard blow...

45:23.982 --> 45:26.662
And not the back? You're sure?

45:30.182 --> 45:31.422
Yes.

45:35.382 --> 45:38.221
Would you like a glass of water
to compose yourself, Dr Alexander?

45:38.222 --> 45:40.262
No, I'm fine, I just..

45:42.342 --> 45:45.381
My lord, the court may be aware
there is an ongoing investigation

45:45.382 --> 45:49.422
as to whether Lyell was culpable in
the collapse of a previous trial.

45:49.423 --> 45:53.062
Part of that investigation
is considering whether Dr Alexander

45:53.063 --> 45:54.342
has acted inappropriately.

45:54.343 --> 45:56.262
And I might say, my lord,

45:56.263 --> 45:59.662
the allegations against Dr
Alexander are very serious.

45:59.663 --> 46:03.422
In the light of that, we submit
that this matter should be

46:03.423 --> 46:06.542
adjourned, pending the outcome
of that investigation, which can,

46:06.543 --> 46:09.503
if appropriate, be presented to this
court as fresh evidence.

46:16.903 --> 46:18.502
Thank you, Mr Delaney.

46:18.503 --> 46:21.904
In the circumstances, we see that
as a sensible way forward.

47:16.705 --> 47:19.745
Oh, my God, they were all there.

47:47.746 --> 47:52.707
Do you agree this was a deliberate
act? An act of sabotage?

47:53.907 --> 47:55.787
I do. Yes.

48:02.107 --> 48:05.547
You have just said as much
in open court. You were wrong.

48:08.627 --> 48:10.707
Sorry, I'm just trying to help.

48:15.347 --> 48:17.267
But YOU'RE certain?

48:19.827 --> 48:23.507
Yes? Yes what? You were wrong
then but you're right now?

48:23.508 --> 48:26.268
Or you were wrong now
and were right then?

48:32.948 --> 48:36.147
And he was found guilty

48:36.148 --> 48:38.748
because of your testimony.

48:43.468 --> 48:45.508
Shall I print this out for you?

49:05.869 --> 49:07.709
Hi, Dad.

49:12.429 --> 49:15.269
According to Mr Delaney,
I'm as good as out.

49:16.429 --> 49:18.869
At the very worst,
I'll get a retrial.

49:20.469 --> 49:23.629
I don't know what you did, Alice,
but you did it.

49:30.870 --> 49:34.869
When I was at uni
and Mum broke her jaw...

49:34.870 --> 49:38.709
..she said she did it, falling over.

49:38.710 --> 49:41.790
Yeah. As she got out of the car.

49:44.310 --> 49:45.710
I saw the photos.

49:48.790 --> 49:51.429
What photos?
What are you talking about?

49:51.430 --> 49:57.230
You could see the sole of a boot
imprinted on her cheek. Your boot.

49:57.231 --> 50:00.510
That's not what happened -
those photos are fake.

50:00.511 --> 50:04.470
Faked?
You think it's as easy as that?

50:04.471 --> 50:07.151
Isn't it?
You stamped on Mum's jaw!

50:10.271 --> 50:13.990
If that was the truth,
I'd have been arrested.

50:13.991 --> 50:15.791
Mum dropped the charges.

50:20.231 --> 50:22.550
If you think that's the truth,

50:22.551 --> 50:28.071
what are you doing here, Alice?
Why have you been helping me?

50:28.072 --> 50:30.351
Cos I believed you!

50:30.352 --> 50:33.032
Cos you're my dad!
Because I loved you!

50:39.032 --> 50:42.712
I know what you did
and I know what I have to do.

50:57.632 --> 50:59.712
Alice rewrote my report.

50:59.713 --> 51:01.272
Why? Why would she do that?

51:01.273 --> 51:03.592
Not only that -
her maiden name is Coulter.

51:03.593 --> 51:05.432
And her father is...

51:05.433 --> 51:07.672
Oh! Gavin Coulter. Yeah.

51:07.673 --> 51:12.272
I've contacted the police. She
went to see her father in prison,

51:12.273 --> 51:14.592
but she's not there,
and she's not at her digs.

51:14.593 --> 51:17.112
Maybe this explains
the contaminated samples.

51:17.113 --> 51:19.553
I'll let DSI Flanagan know.
We need to find her.

51:20.593 --> 51:22.993
Now it's beginning to make sense.

51:46.314 --> 51:47.713
Nikki?

51:47.714 --> 51:49.753
Alice! Please let me explain.

51:49.754 --> 51:52.193
Your father lied to you,
and you believed him.

51:52.194 --> 51:54.833
He was my dad.
And with my mum's MS,

51:54.834 --> 51:57.553
I couldn't think he was anything
but innocent.

51:57.554 --> 52:01.394
He said whenever you stood up
in court, everyone believed you,

52:01.395 --> 52:04.354
so I had to come up with a way to
discredit you.

52:04.355 --> 52:08.074
So you cheated your way
into The Lyell to get close to us,

52:08.075 --> 52:09.315
to me?

52:10.915 --> 52:13.154
Your father's appeal will be
rejected.

52:13.155 --> 52:15.994
Good. He lied to me,
he's completely betrayed me.

52:15.995 --> 52:18.314
And what exactly did you do, Alice?

52:18.315 --> 52:21.714
You haven't thought about anyone
else who's lost someone they loved,

52:21.715 --> 52:24.594
what this work means to them,
to us!

52:24.595 --> 52:28.554
Have you any idea of the number
of cases that could be overturned?

52:28.555 --> 52:30.354
Well, that wasn't my intention.

52:30.355 --> 52:32.595
Contaminating Kalan's sample
with formaldehyde...

52:32.596 --> 52:34.155
My dad's appeal was coming up...

52:34.156 --> 52:38.035
..has meant the truth
about the deaths of two young men...
I kept some of the samples clean!

52:38.036 --> 52:41.035
Any evidence against the lead
suspect will be inadmissible

52:41.036 --> 52:42.636
because of the contamination.

52:43.876 --> 52:47.995
The original samples are in storage.
Surely you could use those now.

52:47.996 --> 52:51.036
Arthur Pujari is no longer
in the country, Alice.

52:55.036 --> 52:58.116
What about the heart belonging
to Steven Francis?

53:00.036 --> 53:01.556
I can tell you where it is.

53:05.757 --> 53:08.916
You saw the evidence concerning your
own mother's murder.

53:08.917 --> 53:11.996
I know. And yet
you still went through with it.

53:11.997 --> 53:14.356
I had...

53:14.357 --> 53:16.396
I had to hear it for myself.

53:16.397 --> 53:18.197
From him.

53:20.157 --> 53:22.597
As soon as he started talking,
I knew...

53:26.797 --> 53:28.557
You need to call the police, Alice.

53:31.397 --> 53:33.197
They'll arrest me.

53:33.198 --> 53:36.597
You need to call the police.

53:36.598 --> 53:39.398
And if you don't, I will.

53:58.678 --> 54:01.277
This could be the lipstick
found on Kalan and Jacob.

54:01.278 --> 54:03.197
Well, according to Jenna,

54:03.198 --> 54:06.518
she and Jacob gave Kalan
the sendoff into the canal.

54:06.519 --> 54:09.638
But she's denying any involvement
in Jacob's death.

54:09.639 --> 54:11.958
Right. What about Arthur Pujari?

54:11.959 --> 54:14.238
Richard's not talking.

54:14.239 --> 54:17.558
But according to Jenna,
Pujari wasn't directly involved.

54:17.559 --> 54:20.998
Not in the drug trials
or the disposing of Kalan's body.

54:20.999 --> 54:22.719
Hm. Nothing is what it seems.

54:23.839 --> 54:25.198
Shall we?

54:25.199 --> 54:26.839
Yes, please.

54:32.039 --> 54:34.278
Dr Alexander,

54:34.279 --> 54:38.560
what are the consequences of the
defendant's actions on your work?

54:40.600 --> 54:44.119
What's the point of experts
if nobody trusts them?

54:44.120 --> 54:48.080
What's the point of evidence
if it can so easily be contaminated?

54:49.880 --> 54:54.119
The whole integrity of
what we strive to achieve could have

54:54.120 --> 54:56.120
been catastrophically undermined.

54:58.320 --> 55:02.559
What my colleagues and I seek to do
is to understand the cause

55:02.560 --> 55:04.800
and manner of a person's death.

55:06.521 --> 55:09.000
But we don't only deal
with the dead.

55:09.001 --> 55:10.840
We deal with the living -

55:10.841 --> 55:17.120
the families, the judiciary,
the coroner, police,

55:17.121 --> 55:18.921
the public, the press.

55:20.521 --> 55:22.481
And they all have to trust us.

55:23.961 --> 55:26.800
And if there is a betrayal
of that trust...

55:26.801 --> 55:29.121
..there is a crime.

55:31.041 --> 55:34.161
The opposite of truth is
not just a lie.

55:35.601 --> 55:40.162
The opposite of truth is chaos...

55:42.642 --> 55:46.521
..a chaos that is in danger of
bringing down the institutions

55:46.522 --> 55:50.882
we depend on to deliver justice.

55:52.162 --> 55:53.722
Thank you, Dr Alexander.
