00:02.870 --> 00:06.181
Here's to running into you guys
on the other side.

00:06.974 --> 00:10.148
When we get to Earth and I release
you, it's an express to heaven.

00:10.310 --> 00:11.983
No time for goodbyes.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.487
I'm here about Castiel.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.025
- Was there any of his grace left?
- Are you willing to pay for it?

00:17.651 --> 00:20.928
He must be returned intact.
Is that clear?

00:21.088 --> 00:23.762
Told you last time I saw you
I'd get out of the slammer.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.604
We need to know how to remove
the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.604
He's gone nuclear. Unh!

00:28.929 --> 00:30.772
Who knew the mark was so toxic?

00:32.332 --> 00:33.572
Actually, I did.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.576
What is the next step
in removing this mark from my arm?

00:39.907 --> 00:40.942
Unh.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.282
The river shall end...

00:43.677 --> 00:44.883
...at the source.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.552
You ever ask me for help again...

00:49.449 --> 00:51.087
...I will choose death.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.026
You're gonna get worse.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.028
- Mommy.
- Fergus.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.793
You think I've been manipulating you?

00:58.025 --> 01:00.096
I am your mother, after all.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.103
We can be a family.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.298
I've been thinking
how wretched it'd be...

01:04.464 --> 01:07.536
...if my own raison d'etre
were taken from me.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.442
Does this mean you'll go
to the Grand Coven on my behalf?

01:10.604 --> 01:14.279
Even better. I've brought
the coven to you.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.951
I believe you know Olivette.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.386
These friends of yours...

01:20.581 --> 01:22.959
...the Winchesters.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.063
I hear they are...
Oh, what do you call it?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.459
Men of Letters?

01:27.654 --> 01:30.157
My relationship with the Winchesters
is my business.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.395
I'll handle them.
I'm not killing them.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.100
All right, dearie.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.797
Of course.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.410
Whatever you say.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.305
Know when to hold 'em

02:13.467 --> 02:15.378
Know when to fold 'em

02:16.303 --> 02:20.615
Know when to walk away
And know when to run

02:20.807 --> 02:26.120
You never count your money
When you're sitting at the table

02:26.313 --> 02:31.956
There 'II be time enough for counting
When the dealing's done

02:33.887 --> 02:35.457
Bobby?

02:37.891 --> 02:39.893
Bobby, can you hear me?

02:40.060 --> 02:42.904
Bobby, we need your help.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.832
Sam?

03:12.492 --> 03:13.994
Sam!

03:16.430 --> 03:18.171
No!

03:19.666 --> 03:21.202
No!

03:21.501 --> 03:22.912
No!

03:23.770 --> 03:25.181
No.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.076
No.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.587
My story began
when I killed my brother...

03:35.782 --> 03:38.524
...and that's where your story
inevitably will end.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.736
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Just, uh, be there.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.642
Yup. Gotta go.

03:56.803 --> 03:57.907
Hey.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.641
How'd you sleep?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.546
Like a drunk baby.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.278
What do we got?

04:04.211 --> 04:06.213
Uh, nothing.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.782
Really?

04:08.215 --> 04:10.752
Yeah. I mean, no weird deaths,
no demon signs.

04:11.051 --> 04:14.760
There's a kitsune working truck stops
outside Boise, but Rudy's on it, so...

04:16.990 --> 04:19.560
All right, so a snow day.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.105
I say we get drunk and shoot crap.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.401
Yeah, except we do that every day.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.579
Actually, I was thinking
about seeing a movie.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.576
I think. that'd be cool.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.239
It's a French movie.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.078
You mean like nudie French?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.810
Even better.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.785
It's about a mime
that's secretly a cockroach.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.484
- I don't get it.
- The New York Times said...

04:42.916 --> 04:44.589
- Who cares?
- Huh.

04:44.751 --> 04:45.786
All right, well...

04:46.620 --> 04:47.928
it's playing in Wichita...

04:48.121 --> 04:50.692
...so I might not be back till morning.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.598
Well, I trust you.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.534
Make good choices.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.338
Right.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.504
You know, I mean...

04:59.666 --> 05:03.705
...I don't have to go alone if... - it's
fine. Besides, I could use a little me time.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.372
All right. Stay out of my room.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.641
Totally.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.865
- Thanks for coming, Class.
- Of course. Where's Dean?

05:32.365 --> 05:33.400
This is about Dean.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.841
- Is he...?
- He's getting worse.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.014
Cass, we've gone through every
other option. We gotta talk about...

05:43.176 --> 05:45.554
- Don't say it.
- Do you think I want this?

05:45.745 --> 05:47.190
I'm not a fan of it either.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.382
But if we want to get rid of the Mark...

05:51.685 --> 05:54.256
I'm just saying,
Charlie's gone radio silent.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.662
Everything else we've tried
has been a dead end.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.660
So...

06:00.360 --> 06:01.532
So I'll drive.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.587
- Oh, God.
Please.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.456
- It's nothing you haven't seen before.
- You're my mother.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.895
I don't want to see anything.
I've been to hell, thanks.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.227
Next time, knock.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.528
This is my domain.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.069
I don't knock.

06:35.462 --> 06:38.932
- Did you want something, Fergus?
- It's Crow...

06:40.033 --> 06:41.535
Forget it.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.270
What are you doing?

06:44.537 --> 06:46.312
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

06:46.473 --> 06:50.114
...you've been nattering constantly
at me for weeks.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.883
And now you haven't
annoyed me for days.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.718
You're up to something.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.554
You're right.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.764
I'm seeing someone.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.404
I'm a woman. I have desires. Needs.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.266
And Trent is...

07:08.628 --> 07:09.971
Trent?

07:10.630 --> 07:12.667
You're dating a Trent?

07:12.832 --> 07:14.937
He's an assistant manager at Biggerson's.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.513
He's not the brightest bulb, but he's so...

07:19.739 --> 07:21.412
- ...firm.
- Please stop talking.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.644
You asked.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.123
Just put some clothes on.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.508
Rudy, Rudy, hey.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.044
Look, I know you can handle it.
I'm just saying...

07:49.202 --> 07:51.512
...that, uh, you know, if you needed
a little assist...

07:51.705 --> 07:53.776
...I could, uh, you know...

07:54.708 --> 07:56.278
All right, all right, all right.

07:56.609 --> 07:59.021
Chill out. I'm sorry I asked.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.019
Huh.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.526
You know me.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.833
I'm always good.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.540
Hey, I'm fan-damn-tastic.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.315
That's far enough, Castiel.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.655
- Excuse me?
- I have orders. You aren't allowed upstairs.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.520
Says who?

08:33.712 --> 08:35.419
Hold, please.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.878
Hello, Castiel.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.447
Hannah.

09:04.010 --> 09:07.014
I swore I'd never occupy
another vessel...

09:07.180 --> 09:09.786
...but we need to have
this conversation face-to-face.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.752
What conversation?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.229
What do you want in heaven?

09:14.621 --> 09:15.895
Metatron.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.194
Why?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.596
Is this about your grace?

09:18.758 --> 09:21.034
- Are you fading?
- I'm fine. For now.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.601
This is about my brother.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.800
Because Metatron might
have information...

09:25.965 --> 09:28.468
...about the Mark of Cain.
- No. We know he does.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.941
So he says.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.240
But Metatron lies.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.248
Hannah...

09:33.440 --> 09:36.284
...we just want to talk with him.
- No, you want his help.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.824
But we both know the only way
Metatron helps you is if he's free.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.318
And I can't let the scribe out of his cell.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.996
Not again. He's too dangerous.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.165
- We won't...
- Yes, you will.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.728
Because you're desperate.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.163
After all I've done for heaven.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.141
After all I've done for you.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.670
I'm sorry.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.240
You should be.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.978
Cass, let's go.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.586
- What, we're leaving?
- We can't fight off four angels.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.753
So, what, you just wanna
give up on Metatron?

10:15.915 --> 10:17.485
No, we need him.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.425
Time for Plan B.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.463
We break him out.

10:34.767 --> 10:38.442
I'm told you run hell's switchboard.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.713
Tough job.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.442
It's not so bad.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.988
- I'm just happy to do my part.
- You sure you're a demon?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.319
You can be damned
and a conscientious worker.

10:48.848 --> 10:49.883
Oh.

10:50.049 --> 10:53.189
Well, last year, my son...

10:53.386 --> 10:56.162
Crowley was taken
by the Winchesters.

10:56.623 --> 11:00.161
I need to know where they were holding him,
and I'm told he made a call.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.636
I was hoping you could trace it for me.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.403
Of course.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.305
You are the Queen Mother.

11:06.733 --> 11:07.837
Oh.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.885
He did call, but there
was some interference.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.221
I can't get the exact location.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.590
Would a 10-mile radius work?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.424
I'll make do.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.598
Hey, Donnie.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.237
Hey, man.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.998
I'll do the Hervé Villechaize.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.369
- You bet.
- Thanks.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.222
- Boom!
- Ugh.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.687
Money. Now. Loser.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.359
Give me your cash.
Now, right now.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.527
- What's up with the Abercrombie rejects?
- College kids. "Slumming it."

12:07.727 --> 12:09.638
What? This is a nice joint.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.901
- You've got those custom urinal pucks.
- Heh.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.046
Come on, bitches, who's next?
Twenty bucks a game.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.305
Twenty bucks.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.119
Yeah, uh, I'll play.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.259
- What, seriously?
- Dude, he's blitzed.

12:29.816 --> 12:33.821
No, no, no. I'm fine, man.
I'm good to go. Hmm?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.498
Good to go.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.065
He's fine.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.327
Grab a stick.

12:40.326 --> 12:44.297
So back in the '50s,
Oliver Pryce was a kid psychic.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.741
He performed everywhere.
Carnivals, Atlantic City, you name it.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.935
He was the real deal.

12:49.135 --> 12:53.174
Now, the Men of Letters were teaching him
how to control his powers...

12:53.339 --> 12:55.410
...when they got, you know...

12:55.608 --> 12:57.281
Brutally slaughtered?

12:57.477 --> 13:01.254
Point is, he's one of the good guys.
He might be happy to see us.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.624
Or not.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.998
Mr. Pryce?

13:21.034 --> 13:23.139
Oliver Pryce?

13:24.637 --> 13:28.141
- I'll break it down.
- Dude, dude, dude. Chill.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.343
What?

13:29.509 --> 13:32.149
- I'm helping.
- Just follow my lead.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.056
Mr. Pryce.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.286
This is Sam...

13:38.985 --> 13:40.293
Winchester.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.866
You're Sam Winchester, Man of Letters.

13:44.691 --> 13:45.726
Yeah. How did you...?

13:45.958 --> 13:48.131
Mind reader, remember?

13:48.294 --> 13:49.329
And you're...

13:52.198 --> 13:54.644
What are you?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.005
I'm an angel.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.544
That...

14:01.708 --> 14:03.016
No, you can't be.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.711
Why not?

14:04.911 --> 14:06.652
Because I'm an atheist.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.417
Not anymore.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.692
- That's you?
- Hmmph. Was me.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.927
I don't do the psychic stuff no more.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.266
Being around people is kind of...

14:22.428 --> 14:23.498
...hell.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.568
All those brains yapping all the time
drives a guy bananas.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.340
Because you can hear everyone's thoughts?
- Not yours.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.174
All I'm getting from you is...

14:32.338 --> 14:33.874
...colors.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.576
But the hippie over here.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.120
I'm seeing some creep-ass...

14:38.277 --> 14:40.780
...Hobbit-looking fella.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.893
A prison cell?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.221
That's heaven's jail.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.054
Heaven's got a freaking jail?

14:47.253 --> 14:49.233
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.733
And we're looking
to break someone out of it.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.028
Okay.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.899
We have an inside man...

14:55.061 --> 14:58.099
...but we need your help to talk to him.
- And if I say no'?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.540
You're the mind reader.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.108
I'll get my crap.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.885
I'll get it. I'll get it.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.898
Corner pocket.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.630
Ugh.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.468
Okay, all right.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.436
Again?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.339
Heh. Sure.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.609
Say a hundred this time?

15:39.005 --> 15:40.780
Make it 300.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.750
- What do you say?
- Uh...

15:47.847 --> 15:49.258
Give me your cash.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.264
I think you're a little short there.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.836
Why don't you toss in the watch?
We're good to go.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.872
- My dad gave me this watch.
- I'm sure it's a touching story.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.476
A little tear in my eye. Ha, ha.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.711
Come on. Are we gonna play or not?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.449
Rack them.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.861
You got anything that belonged
to the deceased?

16:30.022 --> 16:31.524
Yes.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.235
Right here.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.401
Good.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.136
Now, shut up...

16:42.301 --> 16:43.507
...and hold hands.

17:03.489 --> 17:04.991
SAM
Bobby?

17:06.092 --> 17:08.094
Bobby, can you hear me?

17:09.662 --> 17:12.506
Bobby, we need your help.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.401
Sam?

17:15.902 --> 17:17.040
Aaargh.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.416
That one.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.626
- Aaargh!
- Come on.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.463
- You hustled me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

17:36.689 --> 17:40.102
Well, you're pretty quick for a guy
who's all hair gel and body spray.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.365
Thanks, fellas.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.981
Forget it, dude. He's an ass.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.482
Hello, boys.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.343
And, uh, that's what's been happening.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.614
The short version of it, anyway.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.124
You still there, Bobby?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.789
Yeah, Sam.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.627
It's just...

18:44.190 --> 18:46.192
...real good to hear your voice.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.436
Yeah, you too.

18:52.698 --> 18:56.475
Okay. If, uh, I'm understanding right...

18:56.669 --> 19:00.708
...you've gotta figure a way
to get the Mark of Cain off Dean...

19:00.873 --> 19:03.319
...before it turns him back into a demon?

19:04.176 --> 19:05.656
SAM
Pretty much. Yeah.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.350
So just another day at the office
for you boys, huh?

19:12.451 --> 19:14.488
Put Dean on the line.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.968
Dean's not here.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.569
Why not?

19:19.792 --> 19:21.738
Uh, Dean's, um...

19:23.963 --> 19:26.409
He's not in a good place right now, Bobby.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.339
So, what's the play?

19:31.971 --> 19:35.384
Each soul in heaven is locked
in its own private paradise.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.145
That's where you are now.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.550
You need to escape.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.749
You need to find the gate
to Earth and open it.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.426
And then you and I will find Metatron.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.724
He's the Scribe of God.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.924
Hey, Sam...

19:51.090 --> 19:54.094
...you remember when this job was just
chopping up some fang...

19:54.260 --> 19:56.262
...and then tossing back a cold one?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.366
I miss that.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.068
Ditto.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.404
So...

20:04.603 --> 20:07.243
...while I'm playing Steve McQueen...

20:07.406 --> 20:09.079
...anyone gonna be looking for me?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.420
Everyone.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.889
The angels will not like...

20:15.081 --> 20:17.527
...a soul wandering free.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.430
We got a way to slow them down?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.427
Not exactly...

20:23.589 --> 20:26.729
...but you'll figure something out, Bobby.
You always do.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.601
Listen, I appreciate
the warm fuzzy...

20:32.364 --> 20:35.868
...but I ain't exactly playing
on the big leagues these days.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.309
I'm mostly drinking...

20:38.704 --> 20:40.615
...and reading the classics.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.319
Truth is...

20:44.477 --> 20:46.150
...I'm rusty.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.456
And maybe there's
somebody better out there.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.554
SAM
There isn't, Bobby.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.289
And with Dean the way he is...

20:56.555 --> 20:58.501
...this is all we got.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.331
Hell, I'm already dead.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.574
Whats the worst that could happen?

21:12.638 --> 21:14.242
Dean.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.680
Rowena?

21:16.976 --> 21:19.479
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this'!

21:20.146 --> 21:21.682
I'm sorry, did I say "nice girl"?

21:21.914 --> 21:23.484
I meant "evil skank."

21:23.649 --> 21:27.324
Ha, ha, you say that like it's an insult,
but nice girls?

21:27.486 --> 21:29.193
They're pathetic.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.631
Here's to evil skanks.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.200
Whoa, fellas.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.771
What did she do to you?

22:20.372 --> 22:22.545
Someone's tougher than he looks.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.053
You have no idea.

22:42.561 --> 22:43.596
Not possible.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.902
What the hell are you doing here?

22:50.069 --> 22:52.276
Saving my son.

22:52.771 --> 22:53.841
Your son?

22:56.275 --> 22:57.447
Crowley.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.782
"Crowley" Crowley'?

23:01.680 --> 23:04.456
My son is a king.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.796
A god. Or he would be, if you didn't...

23:07.953 --> 23:10.763
You snap your fingers,
and he comes running like a lapdog.

23:10.956 --> 23:14.699
- Lady, I don't know what you're talking about.
- You're a good influence on him.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.203
That's why you need to die.

23:16.362 --> 23:18.364
Sorry your little light show didn't work.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.237
Oh, I'll try again.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.436
You think I'm gonna let you
walk out of here?

23:22.601 --> 23:25.309
I think you're a hero.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.317
You could've killed those men,
but you didn't.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.144
Because they're innocent.

23:30.309 --> 23:33.654
Because you're the good guy,
and you want them to live.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.982
But the spell I cast...

23:36.148 --> 23:40.790
...will devour them from the inside out
like it did that girl.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.328
What did you do to her?

23:51.263 --> 23:53.243
I'm the only one that can save them.

23:55.668 --> 23:58.114
What's it going to be...

23:58.671 --> 23:59.809
...hero?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.451
So where do we start?

24:04.910 --> 24:07.823
You need to find your
heaven's escape hatch.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.927
Look for something that shouldn't be there.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.256
That's your way out.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.360
Just when I thought I was out...

24:47.519 --> 24:49.396
...they pull me back in.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.737
Balls.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.040
Rough date, Mother?

26:04.430 --> 26:06.808
Dean Winchester did this to me.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.639
Get out.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.125
Why were you anywhere near
Dean Winchester?

26:25.284 --> 26:27.662
I was trying to kill him.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.062
Been there.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.600
Never seems to work out
quite the way you want.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.466
The spell I cast
should've ripped him apart, but...

26:36.628 --> 26:39.438
It's like Dean was protected from on high.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.776
It's the Mark of Cain.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.006
It never lets its host die easy.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.439
The Mark?

26:48.974 --> 26:50.282
It's just a curse.

26:50.476 --> 26:53.252
The first curse, but still,
it can be removed.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.249
How?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.492
I'll find a way.

26:58.784 --> 26:59.819
You do that.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.656
I assume you had a reason
for this little suicide run.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.166
The best reason - you.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.766
Those tumshies have you on a leash.
I thought if they were gone...

27:10.929 --> 27:12.465
I know what you thought.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.268
And I know that you were wrong.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.670
I have Sam and Dean
exactly where I want them.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.372
What do they say?

27:19.538 --> 27:21.449
"Friends close, enemies closer."

27:21.974 --> 27:24.181
Maybe they were your enemies once.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.623
But now? Please.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.214
Do you even care...

27:28.380 --> 27:30.792
...that Dean Winchester
mutilated your mother?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.623
- Because you were stupid.
- Because I love you.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.662
Well, if my suffering is not enough...

27:39.858 --> 27:42.065
...you know how much demons gossip.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.707
Right now, word's already spreading
about all this.

27:44.863 --> 27:46.467
If you do nothing, you'll look weak.

27:46.632 --> 27:50.637
Your subjects will start to doubt you, mock
you, then it's just a matter of time...

27:50.802 --> 27:54.375
...before you have a revolt on your hands,
before you lose your throne.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.511
You're playing a dangerous game.

27:56.975 --> 27:59.888
And it's your move.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.821
So you can't kill Dean. Fine.

28:02.981 --> 28:06.019
Take him, throw him in some dark cell,
let him rot...

28:06.185 --> 28:07.858
...but do something!

28:10.255 --> 28:12.166
No more stalling.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.099
No more excuses.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.897
Show them how strong you really are.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.002
Be a bloody king!

28:42.921 --> 28:45.367
You sure he can handle this?

28:45.891 --> 28:47.461
He's Bobby.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.867
He can handle anything.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.584
What?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.818
Find out how this happened.

29:11.216 --> 29:12.388
Excuse me, gentlemen.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.927
Gentlemen. And lady.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.226
I need you to return to your heavens
in a calm, orderly manner.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.424
Oh, yeah?

29:18.924 --> 29:21.165
- Well, who made you boss?
- Right?

29:21.326 --> 29:24.796
- Who do you think you are?
- Hold off, gentlemen. And lady...

29:25.397 --> 29:27.343
Gentlemen, easy!

29:35.107 --> 29:36.848
Been waiting on you.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.246
Squirrel.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.952
Boris. Where's Natasha?

29:43.348 --> 29:44.759
Would it make a difference?

29:45.117 --> 29:46.596
Not really.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.202
So are we gonna do this?

29:55.694 --> 29:57.196
MAN
The Bobbys are fighting back.

29:57.362 --> 29:59.273
All hands. We need all hands.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.535
They're surly.

30:00.699 --> 30:03.475
I repeat, the Bobbys are surly.

30:10.475 --> 30:14.150
- If I find a way out, then what?
- The gate is behind door number...

30:14.513 --> 30:15.548
Forty-two.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.365
Go. Go.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.713
Welcome to the party.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.382
The prison, it's, uh...

30:43.542 --> 30:46.887
- it's close.
- Uh-huh. Cass, where's Dean?

30:47.045 --> 30:49.582
- What?
- You heard me.

30:50.315 --> 30:53.023
Dean's, uh... He's resting. He's...

30:53.185 --> 30:55.256
...sick.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.492
Try again.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.732
- Dean doesn't know we're doing this.
- Well, that's a page...

31:01.893 --> 31:04.874
...right out of the Winchester playbook.
- Dean has given up.

31:05.063 --> 31:07.703
- And you idjits haven't.
- Would you'?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.402
Hell, no.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.019
Not saying I didn't wanna slice
and dice the witch.

31:17.175 --> 31:18.882
Just saying that's not how it went down.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.082
So she's a liar.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.688
Must run in the family.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.034
Mother says that Mark is just a curse.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.365
It can be removed.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.130
Of course, she doesn't know how.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.209
Figures.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.477
But I'm good, thanks.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.311
Who's the liar now?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.491
She says I've gone soft.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.629
You have.

31:59.785 --> 32:00.889
What?

32:01.620 --> 32:04.464
Hell, maybe it's all the human blood
Sammy pumped into you.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.159
Maybe it's, uh...

32:06.958 --> 32:08.062
I don't know.

32:08.226 --> 32:11.503
But the old Crowley would've some here
with hellhounds and demons...

32:11.663 --> 32:13.233
...and blown the roof off the joint.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.134
Now?

32:15.300 --> 32:17.974
You didn't wanna fight.
You wanted to talk.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.982
And maybe I've changed too.

32:23.141 --> 32:26.020
Here I am playing Dr. Phil
to the king of hell. Heh.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.158
Never saw that coming.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.953
Maybe we're getting old.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.422
Never saw that coming either.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.032
What is it, huh?

32:39.591 --> 32:43.038
Why are you letting Mommy Dearest
tie you into knots?

32:43.195 --> 32:44.469
Because...

32:44.629 --> 32:46.336
...we're family.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.768
Blood.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.343
That's not the same thing.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.840
A wise man once told me-

32:54.005 --> 32:56.178
"Family don't end in blood."

32:56.541 --> 32:58.282
It doesn't start there either.

32:58.844 --> 33:01.950
Family cares about you,
not what you can do for them.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.687
Family's there...

33:03.849 --> 33:06.193
...through the good, bad, all of it.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.956
They got your back.

33:09.454 --> 33:10.797
Even when it hurts.

33:10.956 --> 33:11.991
That's family.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.798
That sound like your mother?

33:25.670 --> 33:28.344
Well, howdy, fellas.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.077
This is the Scribe of God?

33:31.309 --> 33:32.720
He looks like a Fraggle.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.525
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.421
That was an excellent program.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.692
Metatron, we are here...

33:39.885 --> 33:43.059
I know why you're here, Asstiel,
and I'm not interested.

33:43.488 --> 33:45.900
I told you, I would rather die...

33:46.057 --> 33:50.335
...than let Dean Winchester use me
as his personal punching bag again.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.208
Don't worry. Dean's not involved.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.902
You're gonna be my punching bag.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.604
Ahhh...

33:59.571 --> 34:00.675
The B-Team, huh?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.855
Interesting.

34:07.078 --> 34:09.114
Keys are over there.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.590
Chop-chop.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.697
Are you sure this is the only way?

34:20.225 --> 34:22.637
Unfortunately.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.984
Samtastic.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.262
Miss me?

34:52.724 --> 34:54.498
Oh, smell that?

34:55.260 --> 34:57.433
That smells like freedom.

34:58.129 --> 35:00.473
Well, let's go. I call shotgun.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.238
You don't get to make demands, Metatron.

35:03.401 --> 35:06.245
- You're not in charge here.
- Oh, I'm afraid I am.

35:06.404 --> 35:07.940
I know about the Mark.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.948
I have your grace.

35:10.141 --> 35:12.314
I make the rules.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.088
Heh, it's called leverage, boys.

35:16.014 --> 35:19.154
Learn it, live it, love it.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.377
We have your grace, Metatron.
You're mortal now.

35:46.011 --> 35:50.721
So you will answer our questions,
or Sam will, um...

35:51.349 --> 35:52.794
What's the phrase?

35:53.551 --> 35:55.121
...blow your fricking brains out.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.222
It's called leverage, Metatron.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.967
Learn it, live it, love it.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.800
- How do we get rid of the Mark?
- I don't know.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.672
Oh, no, no! No. It's old magic.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.540
God-level magic.

36:11.069 --> 36:12.514
Or Lucifer-level.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.151
But you can't ask him, exactly, can you?

36:15.907 --> 36:16.977
What about the tablets?

36:17.175 --> 36:20.019
No, there's nothing in them
about the Mark.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.255
So when you said,
"The river ends at the source..."

36:23.415 --> 36:26.055
I was just making up crap.

36:26.217 --> 36:29.323
I was trying to buy time
till I could screw you over.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.663
What? It worked before.

36:33.725 --> 36:34.863
He's telling the truth.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.771
- What?
- Shoot him.

36:38.396 --> 36:40.273
No, no, no! Your grace.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.706
I wasn't lying about that.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.840
There's still some left.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.016
I'll take you to it.

36:51.076 --> 36:52.953
It's your call, Cass.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.526
Is it done?

37:02.954 --> 37:04.024
We're done.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.367
Get your things and get out.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.268
You aren't serious.

37:08.693 --> 37:09.728
Deadly.

37:11.763 --> 37:15.540
- But I'm your mother.
- You may have brought me into this world...

37:16.234 --> 37:17.770
...but you were never my mother.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.907
So you're choosing the Winchesters.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.108
I'm choosing me.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.416
I put up with your lies...

37:26.611 --> 37:29.649
...your sad little schemes, because...

37:29.814 --> 37:31.384
No.

37:31.716 --> 37:35.129
Because maybe you were right.

37:36.121 --> 37:39.591
Maybe I did lose my edge.

37:40.558 --> 37:42.401
But that ends now.

37:45.563 --> 37:46.837
Tell me, Rowena...

37:48.433 --> 37:50.845
...if I were not the king of hell...

37:51.269 --> 37:54.478
...would you have ever bothered
to pretend to care about me?

37:54.639 --> 37:57.176
You... You can't.

37:57.475 --> 37:58.977
I can.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.248
I'm bloody Crowley!

38:02.347 --> 38:05.920
I'm the king of hell.

38:06.084 --> 38:09.691
I do what I want, when I want.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.661
And I don't take orders from you.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.703
Everything you have...

38:18.463 --> 38:21.535
...I will watch it burn!

38:21.766 --> 38:24.042
I'll give you five minutes.

38:24.502 --> 38:28.279
After that? Pray I don't see you again.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.566
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:54.732 --> 38:56.075
How was the movie?

38:57.669 --> 38:58.704
French, heh.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.317
What about you?
What did you do last night?

39:03.575 --> 39:05.577
Played some pool. It was kind of boring.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.353
- All right, I'm gonna clean up.
- Yeah.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.946
Unh! Asshole.

39:39.878 --> 39:40.948
Sam.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.384
Bobby asked me to give you this.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.397
Sam, so...

39:54.926 --> 39:56.928
This is weird, huh?

39:57.795 --> 40:02.801
Look, I just wanted to say that Cass
told me what you're doing for Dean.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.140
And I'm not asking you to stop...

40:06.471 --> 40:09.816
...but maybe going behind his back
ain't the best idea.

40:11.209 --> 40:14.281
Your brother, he can be stubborn.

40:14.545 --> 40:16.582
But I think he'd understand.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.554
And I know it's the life...

40:19.717 --> 40:23.255
...doing a little bad
so you can do a lot of good.

40:23.755 --> 40:27.134
But sometimes, the bad's real bad.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.333
And the good...

40:29.494 --> 40:32.941
...it can come atone hell of a price.

40:37.468 --> 40:40.415
I ain't there on the ground.
And whatever you do...

40:40.571 --> 40:43.347
...I know you'll make the right choice.

40:43.741 --> 40:46.017
You're a good man, Sam Winchester.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.986
One of the best.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.783
And I'm damn proud of you, son.

40:53.418 --> 40:54.829
I was content up here...

40:56.354 --> 40:58.664
...but getting the call from you...

40:58.823 --> 41:02.202
...it's the happiest I've been in forever.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.603
No matter what it costs.

41:05.797 --> 41:11.372
So stay safe, keep fighting,
and kick it in the ass.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.548
Bobby.
