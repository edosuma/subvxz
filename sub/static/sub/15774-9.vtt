00:04.320 --> 00:05.635
Hey, I'm off to the mall.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.323
What do you do there every day?

00:07.443 --> 00:08.747
You don't have any money.

00:08.867 --> 00:09.830
I don't need money.

00:09.950 --> 00:11.796
I go to the food court
and eat free samples.

00:17.860 --> 00:19.394
Are you looking for your purse?

00:19.396 --> 00:21.162
It's in the closet.

00:21.164 --> 00:23.965
It's a handbag, not a purse.

00:23.967 --> 00:25.767
Why don't you just carry a wallet?

00:25.769 --> 00:28.260
And what am I supposed
to do with all my items?

00:28.262 --> 00:30.672
What items?

00:30.674 --> 00:32.430
My phone,

00:32.433 --> 00:33.827
sunglasses,

00:33.829 --> 00:36.338
my mints, my lip gloss,

00:36.340 --> 00:37.768
my scrunchies.

00:37.770 --> 00:38.902
Ugh.
I can't believe

00:38.904 --> 00:40.369
you go out looking like that.

00:40.371 --> 00:42.366
You're right.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.514
Oh, no.
What'd he do?

01:15.516 --> 01:17.949
He didn't do anything.
His purse was stolen.

01:17.951 --> 01:19.750
It was a handbag.

01:19.752 --> 01:21.785
Anyway, he was extremely distraught,

01:21.787 --> 01:23.555
so we gave him a ride home.

01:23.557 --> 01:26.257
Oh. Do you want
a medal for that?

01:26.259 --> 01:28.660
Where were you when I
was being criminalized?

01:28.662 --> 01:30.228
So we can leave him with you?

01:30.230 --> 01:32.865
Ehh...

01:32.867 --> 01:34.967
We'll let you know
if we find your purse.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.937
Handbag!

01:37.939 --> 01:39.306
Ohh.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.308
What happened?

01:41.310 --> 01:42.676
I was in the food court.

01:42.678 --> 01:44.979
I had just finished
some mini-meatballs

01:44.981 --> 01:46.782
when I noticed
the Cinn-a-Ball girl

01:46.784 --> 01:49.651
with a tray
of Cinn-a-Balls.

01:49.653 --> 01:52.421
Over here, doll.

01:52.423 --> 01:55.024
Mm. Mm!

01:55.026 --> 01:57.259
Oh, that--
ooh, that's nice.

01:57.261 --> 01:58.460
So light.

01:58.462 --> 02:00.496
I'd eaten about 4 or 5,

02:00.498 --> 02:02.564
when she jerked the tray away from me

02:02.566 --> 02:04.232
and told me I'd had enough.

02:04.234 --> 02:07.002
What do you mean, I've
exceeded my sample limit?

02:07.004 --> 02:08.102
Where does it say anything

02:08.104 --> 02:09.704
about a sample limit?

02:09.705 --> 02:12.807
Naturally, I became enraged.

02:12.809 --> 02:15.142
You can't just arbitrarily
make up rules.

02:15.144 --> 02:17.844
This is insanity!
This is Kafka-esque!

02:17.846 --> 02:20.046
I am a valued customer!

02:20.048 --> 02:22.081
What does this have to
do with your purse?

02:22.083 --> 02:24.316
For the last time, it's a handbag.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.951
And I am getting to it.

02:25.953 --> 02:29.154
In order for you to
understand what happened,

02:29.156 --> 02:31.523
you need to know the backstory.

02:31.525 --> 02:33.325
Actually, the backstory's not important.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.294
When I turned around,
my handbag was gone.

02:35.296 --> 02:37.229
So get another handbag.

02:37.231 --> 02:41.034
That handbag was irreplaceable.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.569
I got it years ago in Paris

02:42.571 --> 02:43.870
when I was modeling.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.905
What?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.842
I mean, look at me.

02:49.844 --> 02:51.878
So young and innocent.

02:55.048 --> 02:57.216
Oh, there's me with the bag.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.154
My handbag.

03:01.156 --> 03:03.723
My beautiful handbag.

03:08.795 --> 03:12.264
All right. I can't
listen to this any more.

03:12.266 --> 03:14.266
- Where are you going?
- The mall.

03:14.268 --> 03:16.034
I'm gonna get you a new handbag.

03:16.036 --> 03:19.070
I told you it's irreplaceable.

03:19.072 --> 03:20.504
Fine.

03:20.506 --> 03:22.373
But if you insist,

03:22.375 --> 03:24.942
get something in, like, a
chocolate brown, you know.

03:24.944 --> 03:27.377
Something versatile.
Just not black.

03:27.379 --> 03:29.012
And it should have a lot of pockets.

03:29.014 --> 03:30.548
It needs to be functional

03:30.550 --> 03:32.016
but still fashionable.

03:32.018 --> 03:33.551
But nothing too big.

03:33.553 --> 03:36.054
I don't want a tote.

03:36.056 --> 03:38.256
He's gonna get me a tote.

03:38.258 --> 03:41.626
Uh, what do you mean, I've
exceeded my sample limit?

03:41.628 --> 03:43.761
It didn't say anything
about a sample limit.

03:46.365 --> 03:48.233
Hello.
I am a different person,

03:48.235 --> 03:50.935
and I'm very interested
in one of these samples.

03:50.937 --> 03:53.104
Oh, my gosh!

03:53.106 --> 03:55.406
Is that Bugs?

03:55.408 --> 03:58.575
Oh. I mean, oh, my gosh.
Is that Bugs?

03:58.577 --> 03:59.810
Ooh!

03:59.812 --> 04:01.245
Where did he go?

04:01.247 --> 04:02.579
There he is.

04:04.649 --> 04:06.316
What is he buying a purse for?

04:06.318 --> 04:08.352
Our anniversary!

04:08.354 --> 04:10.487
It's this Friday.
He's buying me a purse.

04:10.489 --> 04:12.589
Oh, bun-bun.
You're so sweet.

04:12.591 --> 04:14.558
I can't believe I almost
forgot our anniversary.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.594
Oh, what am I gonna get for Bugs?

04:17.762 --> 04:19.596
Ahem. I mean,

04:19.599 --> 04:21.332
what am I gonna get for Bugs?

04:24.169 --> 04:26.471
Ehh.

04:26.473 --> 04:29.407
Eh.
I'm a valued customer.

04:29.409 --> 04:32.577
I want another Cinn-a-Ball.

04:44.591 --> 04:45.925
Aah!

04:45.927 --> 04:47.993
Ooh!

04:47.995 --> 04:49.695
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

04:49.697 --> 04:51.697
What time you want me to
pick you up for date night?

04:51.699 --> 04:52.831
Date night?

04:52.833 --> 04:54.599
I can't go anywhere.

04:54.601 --> 04:55.867
What's wrong with you?

04:55.869 --> 04:58.170
I was the victim of a violent crime.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.304
What happened?

04:59.306 --> 05:01.139
My handbag was stolen.

05:01.141 --> 05:03.509
You were mugged?
Did you get beat up?

05:03.511 --> 05:06.912
No. I just turned around and it was gone.

05:06.914 --> 05:10.115
Then you weren't the victim of
a violent crime, you nitwit.

05:10.117 --> 05:11.983
You probably just left it somewhere.

05:11.985 --> 05:13.718
I told you not to carry a purse.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.020
Handbag.

05:15.022 --> 05:17.489
The point is it's gone.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.658
Just like my innocence.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.728
Before this, I would look at strangers

05:22.730 --> 05:24.830
as a friend I hadn't met yet.

05:24.832 --> 05:26.498
I saw the possibility

05:26.500 --> 05:28.333
and the beauty in everything.

05:28.335 --> 05:30.735
I was like a newborn child.

05:30.737 --> 05:33.905
I lived my life with an open heart.

05:33.907 --> 05:36.641
I can't get the person I was back.

05:36.643 --> 05:38.709
That person is gone.

05:42.046 --> 05:43.747
Tina?

05:43.749 --> 05:46.182
Tina? Tina?

05:46.184 --> 05:47.550
Mm, this is kind of nice.

05:47.552 --> 05:49.586
Clean. It's crisp.

05:49.588 --> 05:51.621
He'd look good in this.

05:51.623 --> 05:53.957
Wait a second. I can't
just get Bugs a shirt.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.592
It's our anniversary.

05:55.594 --> 05:57.060
I've gotta get him something incredible.

05:57.062 --> 05:59.295
Something extraordinary.

05:59.297 --> 06:00.763
And I don't care if I have to go

06:00.765 --> 06:02.932
to the ends of the earth to find it.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.075
Yes, uh, I'm interested

06:16.172 --> 06:17.839
in hiring a bodyguard.

06:17.841 --> 06:19.674
I guess 24 hours a day,

06:19.676 --> 06:20.942
7 days a week.

06:20.944 --> 06:23.077
Ex-special forces guy?
Ooh.

06:23.079 --> 06:25.246
Yeah, that sounds good.

06:25.248 --> 06:27.081
$2,500 a day?

06:27.083 --> 06:29.583
Wow. That's kinda steep.

06:29.585 --> 06:31.618
But if it means not having
to look over my shoulder

06:31.620 --> 06:33.287
in fear for the rest of my life,

06:33.289 --> 06:34.621
then I guess it's worth it.

06:34.623 --> 06:35.856
Let's do it.

06:35.858 --> 06:38.858
The name on the card is Bugs Bunny.

06:38.860 --> 06:43.430
The number
is 254677--

06:45.499 --> 06:47.233
I'll call you back.

06:55.576 --> 06:57.343
What the--

06:59.246 --> 07:00.513
Can I help you?

07:00.515 --> 07:02.215
Why doesn't my key work?

07:02.217 --> 07:03.616
I had the locks changed.

07:03.618 --> 07:04.784
You can't be too careful.

07:04.786 --> 07:06.519
Daffy, let me in.

07:06.521 --> 07:07.753
What's the password?

07:07.755 --> 07:10.222
There is no password.
This is my house.

07:10.224 --> 07:12.725
Fine.
But there is a password.

07:14.194 --> 07:17.329
And it's "the leprechaun
is in motion."

07:17.331 --> 07:19.331
What?
That's not a password.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.000
That's a pass sentence.

07:21.002 --> 07:22.101
Oh. Uh,

07:22.103 --> 07:23.969
then the password is...

07:23.971 --> 07:29.108
Zero, 8, 4, 4,

07:29.110 --> 07:33.346
ll-"L", "X", "Z",

07:33.348 --> 07:37.483
4, 1, 7,

07:37.485 --> 07:40.921
dash 6, 6,

07:40.923 --> 07:44.992
4, 7, 1,,

07:44.994 --> 07:47.328
4, 13.

07:47.330 --> 07:48.663
Just let me in!

07:48.665 --> 07:49.998
Not without the password.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.699
Fine.
What is it again?

07:51.701 --> 07:54.769
Zero, 5--
Oh. No, wait.

07:54.771 --> 07:57.806
Zero, 3--
No, wait. What was it?

07:57.808 --> 07:59.841
Oh. I've forgotten
the password.

07:59.843 --> 08:01.610
Well, I can't let you in

08:01.612 --> 08:02.945
without the password.

08:02.947 --> 08:04.913
Please.
Please let me in.

08:04.915 --> 08:07.449
I'm begging you.
It's me, Daffy.

08:07.451 --> 08:09.551
All right.
Just this once.

08:09.553 --> 08:12.153
Unlock the door and I'll let you in.

08:12.155 --> 08:14.188
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much.

08:18.393 --> 08:20.994
Hey, Bugs!
Let me in!

08:20.996 --> 08:23.096
I'm vulnerable out here.

08:23.098 --> 08:24.330
It's unlocked.

08:24.332 --> 08:26.233
Are you out of your mind?

08:26.235 --> 08:28.335
You just leave the door unlocked?

08:28.337 --> 08:30.971
Not that I want to reward
this kind of behavior,

08:30.973 --> 08:32.707
but here.

08:32.708 --> 08:34.308
I got you something.

08:34.309 --> 08:35.844
What is it?

08:35.846 --> 08:37.111
It's a new handbag.

08:37.114 --> 08:38.679
This isn't a handbag.

08:38.682 --> 08:39.914
This is a clutch.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.683
- A what?
- Ugh.

08:41.684 --> 08:44.085
A handbag is a versatile bag

08:44.087 --> 08:45.820
that you can carry every day.

08:45.822 --> 08:47.088
It goes with any outfit.

08:47.090 --> 08:48.823
It's practical, wearable.

08:48.825 --> 08:50.658
This is a clutch.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.026
It's a strapless bag

08:52.028 --> 08:53.794
that is clutched in the hand.

08:53.796 --> 08:56.429
It's an evening bag
for a fancy night out,

08:56.431 --> 08:57.830
like a night at the opera.

08:57.832 --> 08:59.799
Not that you ever take me to the opera.

08:59.801 --> 09:01.768
Fine.
I'll return it.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.270
Well, let's not be hasty.

09:03.272 --> 09:05.038
It's good to have options, you know.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.575
Maybe one night, you actually
will take me to the opera.

09:08.577 --> 09:10.076
Not that I'd even want to go.

09:10.078 --> 09:11.744
I don't want to go anywhere any more.

09:11.746 --> 09:13.880
I don't feel safe.
I mean, look.

09:13.882 --> 09:16.015
There's not enough room
in here for pepper spray.

09:16.017 --> 09:17.950
I can barely fit my credit card.

09:17.952 --> 09:20.519
That's my credit card.

09:20.521 --> 09:22.688
Fine. I'm gonna go see
if there's anything

09:22.690 --> 09:24.757
in my closet that goes with this.

09:24.759 --> 09:26.793
I would have been
better off with a tote.

09:29.297 --> 09:31.198
I'm a valued customer.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.533
I want another Cinn-a-Ball.

09:42.710 --> 09:43.977
Ehh...

09:50.886 --> 09:54.389
Do you mind
if I sleep with you?

10:02.633 --> 10:04.599
- Hello?
- Hi, Bugs. Just making sure

10:04.601 --> 10:06.368
we're all set for Friday night.

10:06.370 --> 10:08.636
Uh, sure.
What's Friday night?

10:08.638 --> 10:09.971
Oh, yeah.

10:09.973 --> 10:11.840
All right, ok.

10:11.842 --> 10:14.943
See you then.
8:00.

10:14.945 --> 10:18.146
Oh. Now what
am I gonna get Bugs?

10:18.148 --> 10:20.014
Oh!

10:20.016 --> 10:22.683
Hmm.
I like the frame.

10:22.685 --> 10:24.319
Oh, her face is tough.

10:24.321 --> 10:26.354
What is she thinking?

10:27.490 --> 10:28.891
Well, this is nice.

10:28.893 --> 10:31.561
Oh, but it's broken.
Ugh.

10:32.930 --> 10:34.964
Ooh! This is perfect.

10:34.966 --> 10:37.833
Excuse me, miss. Hi.
How much for this painting?

10:37.835 --> 10:38.868
Pardon?

10:38.870 --> 10:40.770
Oh, sorry.
You speak French?

10:40.772 --> 10:43.106
Luckily, so do I.
Ahem.

10:43.108 --> 10:45.508
I am
looking for a very special gift

10:45.510 --> 10:49.113
for my boyfriend, and I
want to buy this painting.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.881
Oh, I have a 20.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.316
And two ones.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.819
So, your lucky day.
That is $22.00.

10:58.356 --> 11:01.024
Well! The French
really are rude.

11:01.026 --> 11:03.060
Wait a second, I can't get this.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.995
Bugs is allergic to sunflowers.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.665
Well, time for plan "B".

11:07.667 --> 11:09.533
I can't take it anymore.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.436
I live in a constant state of fear.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.205
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.475
That's a good egg salad.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.709
Here's the deal.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.744
I need someone by my side

11:20.746 --> 11:22.379
24 hours a day.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.316
So, will you be my bodyguard?

11:26.317 --> 11:27.584
Why me?

11:27.586 --> 11:29.052
Porky, you'd be perfect.

11:29.054 --> 11:31.554
For the past 3 years,
you've been taking karate.

11:31.556 --> 11:34.257
I don't take karate.
I take Pilates.

11:34.259 --> 11:37.059
Pilates?
What the heck is Pilates?

11:37.061 --> 11:38.828
It's a body conditioning routine

11:38.830 --> 11:41.730
that builds long, lean muscles.

11:41.732 --> 11:43.765
And you've been taking that for 3 years?

11:43.767 --> 11:45.934
Heh. You should get
your money back.

11:45.936 --> 11:47.736
Well, forget it.
Go home.

11:47.738 --> 11:49.104
I'll figure something out.

11:49.106 --> 11:51.439
No, wait. I want
to be by somebody's side

11:51.441 --> 11:53.408
24 hours a day.

11:53.410 --> 11:54.776
I mean,

11:54.778 --> 11:57.112
I want to be your bodyguard.

11:57.114 --> 11:59.114
I can't thank you enough.

12:01.084 --> 12:02.885
Is there, like, Pilates homework

12:02.887 --> 12:04.853
you haven't been doing?

12:30.047 --> 12:33.550
You know, today was the first
day since the incident

12:33.552 --> 12:35.785
that I've felt like my old self.

12:35.787 --> 12:38.154
Just knowing I had
someone watching over me

12:38.156 --> 12:40.490
gave me the freedom to get out there

12:40.492 --> 12:42.392
and live my life again.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.461
What do you mean,
"get out there?"

12:44.463 --> 12:46.096
You didn't go anywhere.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.731
Is this what you do every day?

12:47.733 --> 12:49.433
Well, I used to go to the mall,

12:49.435 --> 12:52.070
but I don't see myself
doing that anytime soon.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.406
Of course, now that I have a bodyguard,

12:54.408 --> 12:56.107
I guess anything's possible.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.477
Ok.
Well, see you tomorrow.

12:58.479 --> 12:59.678
See me tomorrow?

12:59.680 --> 13:01.079
You're gonna see me all night.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.181
24 hours means 24 hours.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.083
I want to feel those
beady little piggy eyes

13:05.085 --> 13:07.652
on me while I sleep.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.429
I don't know. Maybe I'm
not thinking big enough.

13:16.431 --> 13:19.266
Bugs needs something big and dramatic.

13:19.268 --> 13:21.535
That's it!

13:21.537 --> 13:23.737
That's what I'll get Bugs
for our anniversary.

13:23.739 --> 13:26.673
Oh, it's perfect.
He'll love that.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.576
Uhh. No, wait.
I can't just get him one.

13:29.578 --> 13:32.278
That'll look weird. I'll have
to get him the whole set.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.081
But then, 3?
Is that too much pyramid?

13:35.083 --> 13:37.183
Maybe that's a little too much pyramid.

13:37.185 --> 13:39.119
Ooh, what about that?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.723
No.
That wouldn't be good.

13:43.725 --> 13:45.825
A pet is a lot of responsibility.

13:45.827 --> 13:48.561
He's already got Taz.

13:48.563 --> 13:50.396
Man, this beach goes on forever.

13:50.398 --> 13:52.998
Excuse me? How far
'till we get to the ocean?

13:54.402 --> 13:57.136
Eesh. And I thought
the French were rude.

13:57.138 --> 13:59.205
Uh-oh. Sliding.

13:59.207 --> 14:00.873
Sliding, uh, off the hump.

14:00.875 --> 14:03.642
Um--uh, person?
Person with the leash?

14:03.644 --> 14:04.743
Sand in my mouth.

14:04.745 --> 14:07.146
A lot of hot sand in my mouth.

14:13.154 --> 14:14.987
You gonna get that?

14:14.989 --> 14:16.589
Why would I get it?

14:16.591 --> 14:18.157
Because you're my bodyguard.

14:18.159 --> 14:19.859
What if something happened
to me when I answered it?

14:19.861 --> 14:21.928
The cord could get
wrapped around my neck.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.896
It's a cordless phone.

14:23.898 --> 14:26.032
Just get it.

14:26.034 --> 14:27.567
Hello?

14:27.569 --> 14:29.502
It's the police.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.707
Since we don't have a lot to go on,

14:37.709 --> 14:39.443
we'd like you to look
through these mug shots

14:39.445 --> 14:40.944
and see if you recognize anyone

14:40.946 --> 14:42.513
that might have taken your purse.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.114
Handbag.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.217
Ma'am, relax.
We're just trying to help.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.124
Nope.

14:55.261 --> 14:57.296
Nope, uh-uh.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.769
Hm.
Can I see that one again?

15:11.976 --> 15:15.211
Aha!
I recognize this guy.

15:15.213 --> 15:17.180
So this is the guy
who took your handbag?

15:17.182 --> 15:19.648
No. He's my neighbor.
But someone's gotta pay.

15:19.650 --> 15:20.915
That's not how it works.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.917
I need closure.

15:22.919 --> 15:25.453
Well, sometimes, to help
a victim access memories

15:25.455 --> 15:27.322
they may have suppressed due to trauma,

15:27.324 --> 15:29.557
we use hypnosis. Here.

15:29.559 --> 15:31.593
This is the name
of the therapist we use.

15:33.829 --> 15:34.996
Who's this guy?

15:37.434 --> 15:38.700
My bodyguard.

17:06.523 --> 17:09.325
I think Bugs already has one of these.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.564
Yaah!

17:16.702 --> 17:18.268
Hey!

17:18.270 --> 17:20.770
I'm sorry!

17:20.771 --> 17:25.307
It's just very hard
working 24 hours a day.

17:25.309 --> 17:26.742
You're my 2:00?

17:26.743 --> 17:28.377
You're my therapist?

17:28.378 --> 17:29.711
I thought you were a witch.

17:29.713 --> 17:31.446
Well, some of us gotta make a living.

17:31.448 --> 17:33.381
We can't all mooch off of Bugs Bunny.

17:36.685 --> 17:39.420
Are you my 2:00?

17:39.422 --> 17:41.789
Oh. Uh, I'm actually--

17:41.791 --> 17:43.825
Right this way.

17:47.597 --> 17:50.966
You're getting very sleepy.

17:50.968 --> 17:52.435
When I snap my fingers,

17:52.437 --> 17:54.704
you gonna be all hypnotized.

17:54.706 --> 17:56.439
So let me get this straight.

17:56.441 --> 17:58.442
When the cops can't do their jobs,

17:58.444 --> 17:59.710
they rely on voodoo--

18:01.247 --> 18:02.379
Let's go back to the day

18:02.381 --> 18:03.980
your purse was stolen.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.782
Handbag.

18:05.784 --> 18:09.119
It's a handbag.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.821
What do you mean, I've
exceeded my sample limit?

18:11.823 --> 18:14.623
Where does it say anything
about a sample limit?

18:14.625 --> 18:16.359
Good, you're there.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.927
Now where's your handbag?

18:18.929 --> 18:22.164
It was hanging on the back of my chair.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.665
But now it's gone.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.634
Ok. Ok. Now look around.

18:25.636 --> 18:28.804
What do you see?

18:28.806 --> 18:31.072
He's got it.

18:31.074 --> 18:33.408
That man.
That man's got my handbag.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.644
- Who's got it?
- I can't tell.

18:35.646 --> 18:36.945
I can't make him out.

18:36.947 --> 18:38.513
Well, you gotta try.

18:38.515 --> 18:39.848
He's in a dark jacket.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.483
Good, good.
What else?

18:41.485 --> 18:42.851
His name's on the back.

18:42.853 --> 18:46.054
Ok!
Can you read it?

18:46.056 --> 18:49.525
I don't know.
I think it's in Spanish.

18:49.527 --> 18:52.094
"Mal Secur."

18:52.096 --> 18:54.797
Mal Secura.

18:54.799 --> 18:57.634
His name is Mal Securati.

19:00.004 --> 19:02.272
Is this the name
on the back of the jacket?

19:02.274 --> 19:05.509
Yes! That's it.
Mal Securati.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.879
You fool!
This says "mall security."

19:07.881 --> 19:10.348
I bet your purse
is in the lost and found.

19:10.350 --> 19:14.019
Wait. So I wasn't the
victim of a violent crime?

19:14.021 --> 19:16.455
The only victim here is me

19:16.457 --> 19:19.326
for having to sit here
with you wasting my time.

19:19.328 --> 19:21.929
Now, get on out of here.

19:21.931 --> 19:24.365
Guess I won't be needing
a bodyguard anymore.

19:24.367 --> 19:27.702
Mmmmmm.
"Mal Securati."

19:27.704 --> 19:30.271
I can't thank you enough.

19:30.273 --> 19:33.708
I didn't realize I had been
suppressing so much for so long.

19:33.710 --> 19:34.876
It's all so clear now.

19:34.878 --> 19:36.844
I'll see you next week.

19:39.047 --> 19:42.616
- Where were you?
- Daffy, we need to talk.

19:42.618 --> 19:45.052
I can't be your bodyguard anymore.

19:45.054 --> 19:47.188
- Ok.
- Wow.

19:47.190 --> 19:48.924
That was easier than I thought.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.926
Ok. Also,

19:50.928 --> 19:52.728
if we're gonna be friends,

19:52.730 --> 19:55.364
I need you to treat me like an equal.

19:55.366 --> 19:57.533
No way. Now, give me a ride to the mall.

19:57.535 --> 19:59.135
I've got to pick up my handbag.

19:59.137 --> 20:01.437
Well, one out of two isn't bad.

20:01.439 --> 20:04.474
Ha ha.
Baby steps, huh?

20:08.845 --> 20:10.813
- Here.
- What?

20:10.815 --> 20:12.714
It's nothing.
I mean, you deserve a gift

20:12.716 --> 20:13.849
that's as amazing as you are.

20:13.851 --> 20:15.918
And I looked everywhere, believe me.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.121
But I just ran out of time.
So...

20:19.123 --> 20:21.023
A shirt. Wow.

20:21.025 --> 20:22.691
Thank you.
I love it.

20:22.693 --> 20:23.726
You do?

20:23.728 --> 20:24.893
Sure.

20:24.895 --> 20:26.762
I'd love anything you gave me.

20:26.764 --> 20:29.397
Oh! Happy anniversary,
bun-bun.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.068
So...where's my present?

20:34.070 --> 20:38.239
Oh. Uh, it's...

20:38.241 --> 20:40.541
In the car.
I left it in the car.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.611
Be right back.

20:43.613 --> 20:45.113
Go ahead and order dessert.

20:45.115 --> 20:48.149
I parked really far away.

20:48.151 --> 20:51.219
Anniversary? Where am I gonna
get a gift at this hour?

20:53.755 --> 20:56.590
Perfect.
Now I have a day bag

20:56.592 --> 20:58.892
and an evening bag.

20:58.894 --> 21:00.928
Aah!

21:04.065 --> 21:06.300
My purse!
I mean, my clutch!

21:06.302 --> 21:08.169
Someone stole my clutch.

21:08.171 --> 21:10.037
Help! Stop him!

21:10.039 --> 21:11.939
He's got my clutch!

21:11.941 --> 21:15.677
Hoo! Why does this
keep happening to me?

21:22.160 --> 21:23.194
Man, this thing's small.

21:23.196 --> 21:24.963
Can barely fit my credit card.

21:24.965 --> 21:27.732
Wait a second.
We met on a tennis court.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.934
- So?
- In July.

21:29.936 --> 21:33.138
It's April. Last night
wasn't our anniversary.

21:33.140 --> 21:36.909
Oh. Right. Yes.

21:36.911 --> 21:38.778
Wait. Then why
were you buying a purse?

21:38.780 --> 21:40.747
Oh, I haven't seen these
in years. Look at this.

21:40.749 --> 21:42.148
Oh, it's wonder--oh.

21:42.150 --> 21:43.983
Here I am with Lauren Hutton

21:43.985 --> 21:46.019
and a then-unknown
Bo Derek.

21:46.021 --> 21:49.022
And yes, that's a Bob Mackie jumpsuit.
