00:07.590 --> 00:10.260
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:10.343 --> 00:11.344
[woman] They've just found this.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.179
[man sobbing]

00:13.263 --> 00:16.433
It was just supposed to be a work retreat.
She can't be dead.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.393
[camera clicking]

00:18.476 --> 00:21.771
I know there's a time crunch, but I hope
we don't find his girlfriend's body

00:21.855 --> 00:23.356
until he agrees to go home.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.316
Yeah, but until we find the body,

00:25.400 --> 00:28.028
we're no closer to finding the zombies
who ripped her to shreds.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.032
[tribal drums playing on music player]

00:34.117 --> 00:36.953
Babe? Oh, my God, you're alive!

00:38.538 --> 00:39.539
Babe!

00:39.664 --> 00:41.124
[Lisa chuckles] Wow!

00:41.207 --> 00:42.667
Is this happening?

00:45.253 --> 00:46.212
[music stops]

00:46.296 --> 00:47.422
What are you wearing?

00:48.423 --> 00:49.257
Whoa!

00:50.008 --> 00:50.842
Lisa.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.470
We're inside caution tape.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.348
-Wait. Did someone die?
-Apparently not.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.977
Oh, hey, man. Glenn. Accounting.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.356
What's going on, Lisa?

01:06.232 --> 01:09.277
My guess, Lisa and Glenn's work retreat

01:09.360 --> 01:11.946
took a somewhat romantic
and psychedelic turn.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.619
I totally get your energy, brother,
but can we table this?

01:18.203 --> 01:21.623
'Cause I am peaking right now,
and it's about to go south.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.541
I take it you're Lisa Gertz.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.463
I need the last four of your social.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.091
Zero...

01:33.843 --> 01:36.137
three, two...

01:37.847 --> 01:38.723
four.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.475
Thank you.

01:41.976 --> 01:42.852
Good luck, buddy.

01:45.563 --> 01:49.734
Sixty-nine phones down, three to go.
Still no victim.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.236
It's a journey, Clive.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.491
State trooper found these Raggedy Anns
on a bus near Tacoma.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.661
No ID.
Wouldn't tell us where they're from.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.746
It's not our problem, right?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.249
Child Protective Services
will get them home.

02:05.041 --> 02:05.917
Let's go.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.681
[boy] Sweet ride!

02:20.765 --> 02:23.309
What is that?
Like zero to 60 in, what, five seconds?

02:24.394 --> 02:25.311
Something like that, yeah.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.689
[chuckles] I plan on joining the force
after high school.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.606
[laughs]

02:29.858 --> 02:32.235
-Best of luck to you.
-I thought about being a fireman at first,

02:32.318 --> 02:35.655
but, uh, the boys in blue
are the real heroes. Am I right?

02:36.656 --> 02:39.159
-Firemen get guns?
-[boy] No, they do not.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.118
[Deputy Ted] Enough said.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.037
I hear that cops
do better with the ladies.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.667
Now that is an undisputed fact.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.253
Do you ever feel
like you're an unwitting tool

02:50.336 --> 02:51.337
-of the Prison Industrial Complex?
-[sparks crackling]

02:52.797 --> 02:53.631
[engine starting]

02:53.715 --> 02:55.466
[revving]

02:56.009 --> 02:56.926
[Deputy Ted] Hey!

03:03.266 --> 03:04.309
Oh, come on!

03:05.268 --> 03:06.102
[exhales]

03:10.982 --> 03:12.442
[opening theme music playing]

03:40.053 --> 03:40.929
Yes!

03:41.054 --> 03:43.014
[girls giggling]

03:43.431 --> 03:44.432
Let's go.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.101
Pain in my ass.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.689
In addition to the three dead,
Sullivan and Cortez each lost a leg.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.275
McIlleny lost an eye.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.027
And the suicide bomber?

03:56.986 --> 04:00.281
Still no leads. A Dead Ender, no doubt.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.201
Commander, if I may,

04:04.160 --> 04:08.498
some of our soldiers are expressing
concern that your policies are--

04:08.581 --> 04:10.875
[speaking French]

04:12.961 --> 04:16.464
[in English] They felt safer
before the curfew was eliminated.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.217
They aren't thrilled by the body cameras.

04:19.592 --> 04:23.388
They feel that, um, engaging
in community outreach

04:23.596 --> 04:27.892
and conflict resolution courses is,
well, a waste of time.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.853
So, what, are we voting on policy now?

04:32.146 --> 04:34.440
I'm just giving the Commander
the lay of the land.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.111
We need to be seen
as part of this community,

04:38.945 --> 04:40.738
not an occupying force.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.241
We are an occupying force.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.412
Perhaps, if the Commander spent more time
out in the field...

04:47.662 --> 04:50.623
Maybe you and the Commander should compare
bullet scars, Hobbs.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.377
So we should just kill them with kindness,
these, uh, Dead Enders?

04:54.627 --> 04:56.337
I'm not asking you to hand out flowers.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.966
I'm saying we will hold ourselves
to higher standards.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.552
Whose standards?
Those soldiers were my friends.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.972
-Do you even know their names?
-You are out of line, Sergeant Major.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.181
[Major] Justin.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.777
Adrian Flores moved here from Tallahassee
when he was 17.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.823
Never missed an FSU football game.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.995
Danny Cozza was a local.
Dad runs a fishing charter.

05:31.080 --> 05:36.210
Heather Schooley was from Olympia,
worshipped Sleater-Kinney.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.133
We will not rest until we have found
those responsible for this attack.

05:42.383 --> 05:47.180
But let's keep in mind, there are
half a million humans in Seattle,

05:47.346 --> 05:48.973
and 10,000 of us.

05:50.224 --> 05:53.019
If they decide that we only have
zombie interests at heart,

05:53.186 --> 05:54.604
this city will collapse.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.692
[objects clattering]

06:01.694 --> 06:03.696
-Cooking brains, Ravi?
-[key clinks in bowl]

06:03.780 --> 06:05.364
Thought you already had your monthlies.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.326
Ravi told me you'd been having
a tough go of it.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.206
I know. Your favorite comfort food
is double chocolate brownies,

06:13.748 --> 06:15.541
but brain cannelloni just felt right.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.960
[sizzling]

06:26.219 --> 06:29.180
So you let the winners out of Seattle
to compete on the show,

06:29.263 --> 06:30.807
and they give you ad time?

06:30.890 --> 06:31.724
Mmm-mmm.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.392
There is no way I'm doing that.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.020
Besides, could you imagine the commercial?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.525
<i>"Dance of a Lifetime,</i>
sponsored by Fillmore Graves.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.986
The zombie mercenaries who built the wall
your uncle's trapped behind."

06:44.070 --> 06:45.780
[chuckling]

06:45.863 --> 06:47.532
How are you holding up over there?

06:47.865 --> 06:50.201
[sighs] It's the worst.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.540
My job is pretending to be RoboCop,

06:56.207 --> 07:00.753
but knowing the Buzzfeed Quiz
explicitly told me I'm a C-3PO.

07:02.255 --> 07:06.134
Well, I am on board for all your reforms,
for what it's worth.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.847
And Ravi keeps reminding me that
C-3PO's an Ewok god,

07:11.180 --> 07:12.306
so I got that going for me.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.934
The cannelloni was amazing, Liv.
Thank you.

07:15.852 --> 07:19.147
I thought you could do with a pick-me-up,
so I dropped by The Scratching Post,

07:19.730 --> 07:23.359
picked up some fitness-guru brains.
Seemed like a safe bet.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.445
Fitness guru? Huh!

07:25.945 --> 07:27.447
Hence the sudden urge to gun my lats.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.868
You sneak a little appetizer?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.704
Was my cannelloni a failure?

07:35.621 --> 07:36.497
I...

07:37.582 --> 07:41.210
Replaced your delicious brains
with disgusting brain tube paste

07:41.294 --> 07:42.670
while you were dressing the salad.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.465
-Dude!
-I'm sorry.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.884
You cooking for me means the world to me.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.596
But I can't really afford anyone else
living in my head at the moment.

07:52.847 --> 07:53.848
Not now.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.727
[breathing heavily]

07:59.145 --> 08:02.523
You know, just once I wish you'd ask me
how my day was before using my body.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.441
Mmm.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.652
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.571
How was your day?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.157
It was pretty good, I guess.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.369
Mmm... Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:15.536 --> 08:16.954
How about some reciprocity?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.998
When am I not reciprocal?

08:19.165 --> 08:22.335
Reciprocity is a hallmark
of a Chakrabarti tumble.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.378
No. No, no, no.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.088
My day.

08:26.422 --> 08:27.673
Right. How was your day, love?

08:29.592 --> 08:32.553
-Mmm, well, since you asked...
-Hmm.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.057
I had

08:36.140 --> 08:37.391
a Skype interview

08:37.475 --> 08:39.310
-with this teen journalist from Iowa.
-Mmm.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.812
She's doing a story for her school paper

08:42.813 --> 08:44.565
on influential women under 30.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.609
No biggie.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.195
Ah! Tell me how powerful you are.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.366
She, um, asked me some crazy questions
about zombies.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.325
[Ravi] Mmm-hmm?

08:54.492 --> 08:56.911
Like, tinfoil-hat crazy.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.832
I guess, in Iowa, people think
zombie hordes roam Seattle,

09:01.916 --> 09:05.503
eating human legs like drumsticks,
or that they grow their nails out,

09:06.087 --> 09:07.880
running through schools,
scratching children,

09:08.506 --> 09:09.632
like Freddy Krueger.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.509
Hmm. Human legs?

09:17.723 --> 09:20.059
-Which got me thinking...
-[clears throat]

09:22.603 --> 09:24.897
Seattle could really use
some positive zombie PR.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.315
[Ravi] Mmm.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.734
-You know what we could do?
-Give up?

09:28.818 --> 09:29.694
[grunts]

09:29.777 --> 09:33.739
No. Solicit ideas from the public.
Make it a thing.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.158
I can run it up the pole
with city council.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.538
Of course, they hate each other's guts,
so getting anything done will be hard.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.039
Mmm. So hard.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.667
God, they're frustrating, those two.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.294
So frustrating.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.715
Two? There are only two
city council members?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.759
Do you ever listen to me?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.471
The other five escaped Seattle
before the wall went up.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.599
Mort and Zed are the only ones
who stuck around.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.811
I can't even get them to agree
to hold a new election.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.731
Are you kidding?
I love the idea of a special election.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.066
All I ask is that
we identify the candidates

10:09.150 --> 10:11.110
as zombie or human
right there in the ballot.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.739
The people of Seattle have a right to know
who or what they're voting for.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.199
I'm just afraid Zed might find it a bit...

10:17.450 --> 10:19.785
Divisive. And speciesist.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.205
An election should not be
about us versus them.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.749
I got you there.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.709
Mort is a typical human.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.670
A zombie-hating bully.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.006
I love zombies. Big fan of the culture.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.216
Zed is why you're stuck in this

10:34.383 --> 10:37.136
"not really the Mayor but obligated
to do his job" limbo. He won't...

10:37.345 --> 10:39.847
...come to the table.
He's not interested in solutions.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.266
All he has is these empty slogans and...

10:42.433 --> 10:43.309
No execution.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.435
And he doesn't have the heart...

10:44.602 --> 10:47.063
...the balls to do
what's right for the city.

10:47.938 --> 10:48.814
What can I say?

10:49.398 --> 10:50.316
My hands are tied.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.445
Well, wait.
I had, um, one more item on the agenda.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.366
You want some money for a PR campaign.
I read your email.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.785
We all agree that improving
the national perception of zombies

11:00.868 --> 11:02.286
is critical to the safety of Seattle.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.287
We absolutely agree.

11:03.454 --> 11:07.291
And what good are roads and libraries
and schools and firetrucks

11:07.375 --> 11:09.335
-if we've been nuked, right?
-It's a great idea.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.670
It's just not...

11:10.795 --> 11:11.671
...in the budget.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.924
And if it's not in the budget,
we can't approve it.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.634
Sorry, kid.

11:17.968 --> 11:18.844
Hang in there.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.648
People like us, we get it.
We know it's not about having

11:30.731 --> 11:34.777
a super shredded core, ripped quads,
jacked delts, swole hams, yoked pecs

11:34.860 --> 11:35.945
and insanely tight glutes.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.615
It's about feeling good
and realizing your potential. Am I right?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.035
Liv, I know you're on fitness-nut brain,

11:43.119 --> 11:45.371
but do not try to make me
the Hans to your Franz.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.707
Oh! This could be our lady.
Excuse me, ma'am!

11:49.083 --> 11:51.710
-This is my swole-mate, CB.
-Yeah?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.423
Clive Babineaux. We're Seattle PD.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.883
-You have a moment?
-Oh. Sure. [chuckles]

11:58.342 --> 12:00.803
Excuse the sweat. Damn hot flashes.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.806
Oh. Sweat is just your body fat crying.
May I?

12:03.889 --> 12:04.723
Oh!

12:05.516 --> 12:06.350
[grunts]

12:09.019 --> 12:10.896
[breathing heavily and grunting]

12:11.772 --> 12:15.109
We're investigating a potential homicide
that took place last week

12:15.192 --> 12:16.360
outside of a convenience store.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.737
Oh, I saw the footage. That poor woman.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.739
And the victim was on her cell
just before the attack,

12:20.823 --> 12:23.826
so we're tracking down every phone
that pinged the nearest tower.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.035
Okay.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.122
You mind telling me
the last four of your social?

12:28.205 --> 12:30.040
Oh. Sure. Two, one, nine, eight.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.876
[Liv huffing]

12:31.959 --> 12:34.128
-[grunting]
-[trashcan rattling]

12:36.297 --> 12:37.965
I'm glad you're okay, Mrs. Jones.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.593
Oh, wait. You're the one
that's been calling me.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.052
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.598
I don't answer unknown numbers.
I donated to a non-profit once,

12:45.681 --> 12:47.349
and now, every time the phone rings,
it's like,

12:47.433 --> 12:50.895
"Hey! Give $10 for the Sumatran rhino."
Are you kidding me?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.688
Okay. I get guilt-tripped enough.

12:52.813 --> 12:57.359
Like when Larry, that's my second husband,
contracted cholera. Don't ask.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.653
And he was all like,
"You have the power to help me."

12:59.778 --> 13:03.699
Until I agreed to steal hydrocodone
for his stomach pain.

13:04.533 --> 13:08.120
He was exploding like a hydrant
in a Brooklyn heat wave.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.623
Oh, oopsie!

13:11.499 --> 13:13.334
I probably shouldn't be
telling the cops about stealing the meds.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.586
That's okay. Liv. Liv!

13:16.420 --> 13:18.422
-[laughs] Liv.
-[Liv breathing heavily]

13:19.465 --> 13:20.508
Bye.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.260
Good news. The lab should be sending

13:23.344 --> 13:25.971
the blood test results
the convenience store murder tomorrow.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.139
That's what's up!

13:28.057 --> 13:31.018
There's stress in your voice, bro.
You getting enough Omega-3s?

13:31.977 --> 13:35.147
-It's just Peyton. She's a little bit--
-Underwhelmed in the sack?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.360
-What? Did she say something?
-You're probably overdoing it.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.696
It's a common mistake for young men.
It's simpler than you think.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.659
You know, four hours before sex,
you just take a nice bath,

13:46.992 --> 13:49.119
-eat three Brazil nuts...
-Okay, thank you.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.788
...a spoon of fermented trout butter

13:50.871 --> 13:53.457
and then during the jam sesh,
you just sort of soak.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.545
You know, think of it as a hot tub,
not a lap pool.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.463
And focus on the eyes.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.592
I was gonna say,
she's a bit overwhelmed at work.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.302
[scoffs] Aren't we all?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.805
Hey, we should hit the gym after work.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.140
Ow! Ow! I'm good, actually.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.936
Oh, come on. Bro, don't you wanna be
Ravi Rock-Hard-Body?

14:14.019 --> 14:14.853
Nope.

14:15.062 --> 14:15.896
Oh.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.273
[keyboard keys clacking]

14:21.068 --> 14:22.778
What are you putting in that gob of yours?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.573
Goose muddled in antler sauce,

14:26.532 --> 14:27.533
a civet of hare,

14:28.367 --> 14:32.746
six hard-boiled eggs covered in saffron
and flavored with cloves,

14:33.205 --> 14:35.708
-and while you're here, innkeep...
-My lord.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.128
...perchance a sprinkling
of grated myconid in my soup.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.632
Tell me when.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.134
[imitating grating]

14:46.468 --> 14:47.303
[slurping]

14:51.682 --> 14:52.516
[slurping continues]

14:53.684 --> 14:55.144
[knocking]

14:55.269 --> 14:56.103
Ah.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.730
'Tis sufficient.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.648
[clears throat] I...

15:00.524 --> 15:02.401
take a seat next to Mr. Bandywax.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.904
You must come with me now,
my halfling friend.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.365
Now? Oh, not now!

15:08.866 --> 15:11.702
Mayhap anon. My goose remains uncooked.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.330
Don't sit there pitch-kettled,
Mr. Bandywax.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.706
If you don't come forsooth,

15:16.123 --> 15:18.584
you risk never gandering another goose,
be it cooked or raw.

15:18.876 --> 15:22.212
I rush to the table,
take the remaining seat.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.381
Prithee, Mosco,

15:24.840 --> 15:28.218
leave thy belly-timber thither
and let us flee,

15:28.677 --> 15:33.140
lest thy be the very cooked goose
thou longs to taste.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.143
Okay. Are you guys gonna kill
some monsters,

15:36.226 --> 15:39.355
or am I gonna send Gorlogg
the Attention Seeker in here

15:39.438 --> 15:40.648
with his vorpal blade?

15:40.981 --> 15:45.736
My cousin in Ohio thinks that
I turned zombie for attention.

15:46.028 --> 15:46.862
[laughing]

15:49.073 --> 15:50.991
Didn't you turn vampire for a girl?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.118
Do you mind if I steal that line?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.537
My comedy troupe could use it
for our zombie sketch.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.040
You're in a comedy troupe?
How did I not know this?

15:58.624 --> 16:01.543
-They're not bad.
-Three straight regional Yuk Yuks,

16:01.627 --> 16:03.712
-so suck it, Steve.
-Then, no.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.465
You can't steal
"turning zombie for attention."

16:06.799 --> 16:07.633
[Ravi] Wait.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.593
-You do zombie sketches?
-They kill.

16:09.677 --> 16:13.514
It's actually a portfolio of sketches
about living next door to zombies.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.392
[laughs] We had this one bit called
"Dinner at the Deadman's,"

16:16.725 --> 16:20.145
where my human brother tries to help me
pray away the Z's.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.942
So good... It's so good.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.696
Uh, we go all out, too, you know.
Like, white wig, zombie makeup.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.490
So you paint your face
and appropriate another culture?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.703
-Never thought of it that way.
-Cool.

16:35.786 --> 16:36.996
-Yeah.
-Whatever.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.206
I've got two hours
before my pregnant wife comes home

16:39.289 --> 16:41.750
and realizes that I'm not there
making her tea

16:41.834 --> 16:44.962
-and rubbing her back so--
-Hold on. Tell me more about this sketch.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.007
Okay. So what we like to try to do is--

16:48.132 --> 16:49.008
Whack!

16:49.091 --> 16:52.928
Gorlogg lifts Mosco's severed head
in the air and shouts,

16:54.138 --> 16:55.931
"I am Gorlogg!

16:57.266 --> 17:00.102
Look at me. Look at me!"

17:05.649 --> 17:06.942
[slurping]

17:08.110 --> 17:09.236
Roll for initiative.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.658
To hell with the police.
They ain't the ones getting blown up.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.996
Blue lives matter? Uh-uh.
White lives matter.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.665
Hate to break it to you.
You're far from white, Spud.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.876
Tell those Dead Enders
calling me "Whitey."

17:24.710 --> 17:26.962
Most humans are decent people.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.380
You sound like Lillywhite.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.507
The Commander is trying to keep the peace.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.302
We push humans too far,
and they're gonna look around

17:33.385 --> 17:37.806
and decide that they'd rather die fighting
than live in a walled zombie homeland.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.975
-We could take them.
-You're an idiot.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.310
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

17:42.436 --> 17:44.104
-Get cover!
-Look out!

17:45.397 --> 17:47.149
[groaning]

17:51.153 --> 17:53.947
[panting]

18:03.665 --> 18:04.625
Up there!

18:05.667 --> 18:07.211
[gunshot]

18:08.962 --> 18:11.298
[Justin] How about these two?
John and David Mendez.

18:11.381 --> 18:15.135
They have a father in San Diego,
dying of cancer, and a senile mother.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.471
She'll be all on her own once he passes.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.599
And the brothers themselves?
They're healthy?

18:21.809 --> 18:22.643
Mmm-hmm.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.645
I'm going to hell.

18:25.979 --> 18:26.897
Reject pile.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.732
Commander.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.612
Our squad was ambushed
in an alley off Hayes Street.

18:35.739 --> 18:36.615
Sir...

18:38.617 --> 18:39.493
Jordan didn't make it.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.313
[exhaling]

19:14.278 --> 19:16.113
[sobbing]

19:18.157 --> 19:19.575
[sniffles]

19:19.658 --> 19:21.994
Give me Chase Graves
over Lillywhite any day.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.246
-Oh, you could say that again.
-Yeah. He'll get his.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.207
Hey, you knew which side he was on.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.626
What do you think flower-power
will do about it?

19:30.210 --> 19:31.211
Put on some Bob Marley,

19:31.753 --> 19:35.090
bus in a few more grief counselors,
remind us how outnumbered we are.

19:35.382 --> 19:38.010
We need to clap back before this
"Can't we all get along?" crap

19:38.093 --> 19:39.052
gets us all killed.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.679
[sighs]

19:40.762 --> 19:41.638
[Spud] "Excuse me, sir.

19:42.097 --> 19:45.184
Couldn't help but notice that you've got
a high-powered rifle pointed at my skull.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.519
I must warn you that,
if you shoot me in the head,

19:47.603 --> 19:51.064
I will then, and only then,
be given permission to return fire."

19:51.648 --> 19:52.566
[chuckles]

19:52.649 --> 19:54.484
What? You know I'm right.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.701
You think your anger
makes you special, Spud?

20:03.577 --> 20:04.494
When I found Jordan,

20:04.661 --> 20:07.414
she was digging brain tubes
out of bus station garbage cans.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.791
I brought her here, and I trained her.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.836
She died saving your sergeant.

20:15.797 --> 20:19.384
What were you hiding behind
when she was putting herself in danger?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.472
I know what Jordan's done
for her fellow zombie.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.144
You, I'm not so sure about.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.649
I'm asking you to be smart.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.987
Don't you get it?
They want to provoke violence.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.075
Only 10% of the human population
wants a war.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.954
CHICs. Dead Enders.
Are you gonna give them what they want?

20:48.121 --> 20:50.332
Yeah, some of us are gonna die,

20:51.333 --> 20:53.585
so that all of us don't die.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.756
If that's not what you signed up for,
then go.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.011
That goes for all of you.

21:03.178 --> 21:07.391
Commander, if we catch the shooter,
or the people who made that truck bomb...

21:09.434 --> 21:10.602
what are you gonna do to them?

21:12.396 --> 21:14.314
They'll be turned over
to the court system.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.067
With human judges? Human juries?

21:17.234 --> 21:20.445
It's the law. It's what we do.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.371
Okay, we are gonna have
zombie super-strength.

21:29.830 --> 21:30.956
How cool is that?

21:31.039 --> 21:33.792
The next time someone asks us to choose
between the belt and the boot,

21:34.084 --> 21:35.711
we can just rip their arms off.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.754
[coughing]

21:42.009 --> 21:44.845
Coast is clear, but stay on your toes.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.848
There's lots of U.S. Army
between us and Seattle.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.061
-Where do we meet if we have to split up?
-[all] 369 Molino Road.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.605
Good.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.110
A pint of ranch dressing
has 2,200 calories, FYI.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.196
-Good to know. Thanks.
-It's just...

22:03.947 --> 22:05.866
I know you like ranch dressing.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.618
I usually manage to avoid
having a pint in a sitting.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.207
One more name to cross off.
Why can't people just answer their phones?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.835
[dispatcher over radio] <i>All nearby units.</i>
<i>Shots fired at Warmbloods,</i>

22:16.918 --> 22:18.462
<i>21807 Third Street.</i>

22:19.212 --> 22:20.714
Warmbloods. That's close.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.799
[siren blaring]

22:26.344 --> 22:27.345
He was in a hurry.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.266
[man groaning]

22:31.641 --> 22:32.517
Just hang in there.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.311
-More pressure.
-Put pressure right there.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.021
-Right.
-Hang on. Yes.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.066
Seattle PD.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.317
[man groaning loudly]

22:40.734 --> 22:43.487
-You're gonna make it. Come on.
-Stay with us, buddy. Stay with us.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.988
We're here for you.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.408
You got the wrong bar, Renegade.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.328
Let me stop the bleeding.

22:51.411 --> 22:54.372
Don't touch me, Whitey.
I know what you are.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.291
You heard the man. Back off.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.127
Your friend is dying.
He needs medical attention now.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.588
I won't scratch him. I promise.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.382
Your kind's done enough damage already.
Get the hell out of here.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.760
I suggest you step aside,
or I'll place you under arrest

23:06.843 --> 23:08.345
for obstructing an officer.

23:09.846 --> 23:10.722
Let 'em through, Matty.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.225
Nothing they can do now.

23:32.744 --> 23:33.662
What do you know?

23:34.287 --> 23:36.248
-It was a drive-by. Two people in masks.
-[camera clicking]

23:36.581 --> 23:37.916
How many casualties?

23:38.959 --> 23:39.793
One.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.755
Witnesses saw the shooter and driver
take off in a blue Civic hatchback.

23:44.131 --> 23:47.342
Matches with the vehicle we saw
racing off on our way over.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.553
See if any of our guys
own a car like that.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.388
Of course, Commander.

23:52.848 --> 23:53.682
[man] Hey, Commander!

23:56.351 --> 23:57.769
How y'all gonna cover this one up?

23:58.895 --> 23:59.855
So what are we gonna hear on the news?

24:01.106 --> 24:06.361
"Eddie Diggs died of natural causes.
He is survived by his wife and two kids."

24:09.072 --> 24:10.490
[Peyton] <i>Ravi, no. I'm exhausted.</i>

24:10.574 --> 24:13.451
I just watched a barber shop quartet
do "Ebony and Ivory."

24:13.535 --> 24:15.620
Two of them in whiteface.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.789
You can tell me at home.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.625
Yeah, I'm still here,
but I'm walking out now.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.878
Yes, this is me walking out.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.423
This is me turning out the lights,
locking up.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.341
Oh, you lie.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.762
Okay. You got me. What is so important?

24:33.555 --> 24:34.806
Are you still hearing presentations?

24:34.890 --> 24:36.766
I just finished. Thank God.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.019
You got time for one more?

24:41.521 --> 24:42.480
Okay.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.357
Psst! [snaps fingers]

24:44.816 --> 24:46.109
[clears throat]

24:46.193 --> 24:47.360
-Stand there.
-Yeah.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.820
[clears throat]

24:48.945 --> 24:52.657
-Jimmy and his comedy troupe do a--
-Portfolio of sketches.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.785
About a human couple living
next door to a zombie couple.

24:56.161 --> 24:59.039
Oh, there's laughs. There's heart.
And guess what.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.749
You might just learn a thing or two.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.960
Great! Now all we have to do
is convince millions of Americans

25:04.044 --> 25:06.880
to cross the militarized dead zone,
make it over the wall

25:06.963 --> 25:10.008
to the zombie-controlled city of Seattle,
and get themselves to...

25:10.217 --> 25:11.760
Where do you perform, Jimmy?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.304
Count McCackles' Comedy Castle.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.266
Yeah, see, I knew she wouldn't see
the potential. Suits, man.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.560
We produce the episodes.
We post them online.

25:20.644 --> 25:21.895
The episodes go viral.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.438
Viral's good.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.191
Think about what <i>Will & Grace</i>
did for gay people

25:26.524 --> 25:29.903
-or what <i>The Cosby Show</i> did for--
-Let's not use that example.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.781
<i>Crazy Rich Zombies.</i>

25:33.073 --> 25:35.450
Okay. I see your point.

25:35.533 --> 25:38.453
Zombies?
[scoffs] They're just the folk next door.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.664
The people you wave to every day
on your way to work.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.917
-Do you have a name for it?
-Wait for it.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.795
<i>Hi, Zombie!</i>

25:48.004 --> 25:49.130
Hmm.

25:50.090 --> 25:50.924
[whispers] <i>Hi, Zombie.</i>

25:51.424 --> 25:54.177
Jury's out on the name,
but I love the idea.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.638
It's one of the best I've heard all day.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.348
How much does it cost?

25:59.266 --> 26:00.433
[Ravi] Oh...

26:01.518 --> 26:02.852
Something like that.

26:03.478 --> 26:08.066
You know, uh, to build sets,
hire a crew and a stage.

26:08.692 --> 26:12.028
Why don't we just put
the first zombie on the moon, too?

26:12.195 --> 26:13.029
Yeah.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.035
-Here you go, hon.
-Thanks.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.998
You hear about the four dead
at Warmbloods?

26:23.290 --> 26:26.293
Four? They said on the news
there was just one.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.128
And you believe
everything they say on the news?

26:29.087 --> 26:30.964
Those necros downplay everything.

26:33.466 --> 26:37.220
That poor woman outside
the convenience store?

26:37.679 --> 26:40.682
I got a buddy down in Chehalis,
rolls with the crew.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.184
Started running patrol shifts
to protect the border.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.730
About time someone's
willing to do something, right?

26:47.439 --> 26:50.358
Lady, these boys is locked and loaded.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.652
Hell, some of them
even use bows and arrows.

26:52.902 --> 26:57.073
Okay. Well, let's hope
they bring home some scalps.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.870
There she is!
Now, that's a beautiful sight.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.204
Yeah.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.456
[laughing]

27:05.874 --> 27:06.791
Race you to the wall.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.463
My God, that kid's gullible.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.132
[screaming with joy]

27:14.257 --> 27:15.842
[all laughing]

27:16.634 --> 27:19.054
Ha, ha, ha! Dicks.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.140
-Can't believe she ran all the way.
-We made it, man.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.184
And all in one piece.

27:31.608 --> 27:32.984
Go! Go! Go! There's a bunch of them.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.403
-Get under the SUV.
-What about you?

27:35.570 --> 27:36.613
-Just go!
-Go!

27:47.207 --> 27:50.752
Run! Run! Run! Don't stop! Just go!

27:51.628 --> 27:52.462
Stay down.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.683
[gun firing]

28:12.273 --> 28:14.109
[groaning]

28:26.830 --> 28:27.831
[leader] The kids went that way.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.708
Let's go. Move!

28:34.379 --> 28:36.423
[sobbing]

28:41.720 --> 28:43.930
Can you not? It's a little distracting.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.350
Distracting? Oh, you mean these bad boys?

28:49.477 --> 28:50.729
Feels good to let them breathe.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.230
I'll take your word.

28:52.313 --> 28:55.984
Come on, CB. We're police.
We have a right to bare arms.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.112
Ah... There he is.

29:00.113 --> 29:04.451
I'm sad to say that your final potential
murder victim is alive and well.

29:04.826 --> 29:08.037
This picture was posted yesterday
by one of her friends.

29:09.205 --> 29:13.042
That photo could have been taken
months ago and posted by our killer.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.128
But on closer inspection...

29:17.005 --> 29:20.884
Yesterday's footage of the Warmbloods
shooting. She can't be deceased.

29:25.054 --> 29:25.972
You're welcome.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.020
Over 70 phones, every one of their owners
alive and accounted for.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.646
We should tell Bozzio.

29:35.356 --> 29:37.275
Harris! You seen the Lieutenant?

29:37.650 --> 29:40.403
Uh, she's in interrogation
with another car club guy.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.619
You watch the video of the murder
outside the convenience store?

29:48.578 --> 29:49.412
Uh-huh.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.956
The killers were in a lowrider.

29:52.373 --> 29:55.919
I get it. You see a lowrider, you
immediately bring in the Latino, right?

29:56.544 --> 30:00.757
Victor Ruiz. You are the founder
of Seattle Lowrider Consortium?

30:01.132 --> 30:02.884
So? That makes me a murderer?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.636
You guys put on a lot of car shows.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.888
You're saying I consort
with murderers, then?

30:07.931 --> 30:08.807
Your word.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.310
Recognize this car?

30:14.604 --> 30:16.064
[chuckles] Yeah, I know that car.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.149
But you're not going to find
the guy who owns it.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.443
He left Seattle before the wall went up.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.113
I know where the car is, though.

30:24.948 --> 30:29.494
[Dale] Well, then. Would you mind writing
down that address for us, Mr. Ruiz?

30:29.828 --> 30:30.662
You having a vision?

30:31.454 --> 30:36.125
I'm Kegeling. Pelvic floor.
Tragically overlooked muscle group.

30:44.175 --> 30:47.887
See what I did there, Clive?
Lift with your legs. Back flat.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.474
Huh. I think this is our car.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.352
Detective school is really paying off.

30:59.691 --> 31:03.111
Exposed wires from
the steering column indicate hot-wiring.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.613
Sorry. Traffic. What'd I miss?

31:07.699 --> 31:08.658
Good Lord.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.119
Uh... So, I've got some weird news.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.371
You and Peyton tried
the soak-and-stare technique?

31:13.538 --> 31:14.372
Uh, no.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.542
The DNA results came back from the blood
taken from the convenience store.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.419
-Were they able to identify the victim?
-Not yet.

31:19.669 --> 31:24.173
But there was blood from a dozen people,
all human. Not a drop was zombie.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.427
Well, we still need to test this blood.

31:29.178 --> 31:30.013
[Ravi] Hmm...

31:35.184 --> 31:36.019
Strange.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.481
[Clive exclaims]

31:41.357 --> 31:44.569
-I'm gonna puke.
-Don't. It's corn syrup.

31:44.652 --> 31:45.612
What?

31:48.865 --> 31:51.784
-Hey, bros. This look familiar?
-A wig.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.913
Looks like detective classes
are paying off for all of us.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.499
Oh, just like the victim's hair
in the convenience store video.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.004
-It's corn syrup.
-Nice work, Ravi.

32:03.087 --> 32:06.633
-Thank you.
-You just ate 57 empty calories.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.179
So the video was a hoax?

32:12.430 --> 32:13.389
No one's dead?

32:14.057 --> 32:16.225
Every person whose cell-phone pinged
the tower at the time

32:16.309 --> 32:17.852
is still alive and accounted for.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.772
The corn syrup blood in the car
is a pretty dead giveaway.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.732
And the blood found
at the convenience store

32:22.815 --> 32:24.859
was from multiple people. All humans.

32:24.984 --> 32:27.779
We also found a wig that matches
the victim's hairstyle.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.365
What kind of a sicko
fakes a zombie attack?

32:30.531 --> 32:32.241
Someone who wants to see the city burn.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.535
I'll call a press conference,
expose the video as a fake.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.495
And what are you gonna say?

32:36.621 --> 32:39.832
"Hey, everybody! That video you saw
of two zombies ripping a woman to shreds?

32:39.916 --> 32:41.167
It never happened.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.419
Oh, and we don't know
who was behind the false flag,

32:43.544 --> 32:45.213
so just take our word for it."

32:45.463 --> 32:47.340
Well, Major, it has the advantage
of being true.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.092
Well, the truth's not gonna cut it.

32:49.175 --> 32:52.595
Look, our words won't trump their images,
okay? People saw a murder.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.723
If we're gonna claim it was a hoax,
we gotta put some meat on the bone.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.059
What are you suggesting?

32:58.643 --> 33:01.729
We get people to confess,
say they fabricated the murder.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.273
They want to stir up zombie hate
with fake news? Fine.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.441
We'll fight them on their terms.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.154
And you expect
Seattle PD to get behind this?

33:11.155 --> 33:13.282
Only if it wants to keep
its homicide rate in check.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.536
Are you sure about this, Major?

33:19.789 --> 33:22.208
There's gonna be a lot of heat
on whoever takes the fall for this.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.586
We'll need to get them out of Seattle,
and we'll have to do it discreetly.

33:27.088 --> 33:30.425
-Liv?
-What? No.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.053
I wanna live in your world.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.724
Peyton, Lieutenant,
expect my instructions.

33:49.318 --> 33:53.406
<i>Voilà.</i> Officers Chris Tader
and Buddy Jackson.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.284
Jackson owns the blue hatchback.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.454
And residue shows Tader fired his weapon.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.456
Both have confessed.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.791
Couldn't keep it in your pants, huh, Spud?

34:09.172 --> 34:10.423
They resisted.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.259
I didn't shoot anyone
who didn't deserve it.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.552
And you're judge and jury now?

34:15.553 --> 34:17.930
Someone's gotta be, Ol' Softy.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.807
That is your Commander, soldier.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.559
Chase Graves is my commander.

34:26.689 --> 34:28.608
Your move, Commander.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.450
[door clicks]

34:38.367 --> 34:39.452
Have they said anything yet?

34:40.119 --> 34:41.996
Very little. They're waiting for you.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.252
Renegade.

34:49.504 --> 34:50.546
Where's Baron?

34:55.218 --> 34:56.260
Where's Baron?

34:57.970 --> 34:58.846
He's gone.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.809
We thought we made it.
We were at the wall and...

35:05.269 --> 35:08.523
These two hitched along.
Bad foster home situation.

35:10.274 --> 35:14.237
Can Oliver get his scratch?
He's very sick.

35:16.781 --> 35:17.949
[sighs]

35:53.025 --> 35:55.236
<i>It was at this intersection</i>
<i>that a mystery woman,</i>

35:55.319 --> 36:00.074
<i>now identified as Cynthia Rybnicki,</i>
<i>was brutally murdered by two zombies.</i>

36:00.658 --> 36:01.659
<i>Or was she?</i>

36:01.826 --> 36:05.037
<i>Today, the Seattle Police Department</i>

<i>As they were brought in for processing,</i>

36:14.797 --> 36:19.051
<i>Ms. Rybnicki gave a defiant hand sign</i>
<i>associated with the Dead Enders...</i>

36:19.302 --> 36:20.928
[crowd cheering]

36:21.179 --> 36:23.097
[woman on TV] <i>The Mendez brothers</i>
<i>and Ms. Rybnicki</i>

36:23.181 --> 36:25.266

36:31.063 --> 36:33.441
<i>The DA promised me it would be</i>

37:09.560 --> 37:10.811

37:25.201 --> 37:27.745

37:28.120 --> 37:30.498
<i>When my soldiers break the law,</i>

37:31.707 --> 37:34.543
<i>Every human and zombie in the city</i>

Hell of a performance.

37:38.464 --> 37:39.507
[woman on TV] <i>And there you have it.</i>

37:39.590 --> 37:40.758
You think it'll work?

37:41.759 --> 37:43.135
You think they'll keep quiet?

37:43.344 --> 37:45.596
They're getting what they want.
Passage out of the city.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.307
They're incredibly grateful.

37:49.433 --> 37:50.685
Thanks for getting them out.

37:51.060 --> 37:51.978
It's what I do.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.438
Why'd you change your mind?

37:59.402 --> 38:01.028
I was already living in your world.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.949
I just didn't know it yet.

38:15.751 --> 38:16.836
You both sure?

38:26.429 --> 38:28.389
[girls wincing]

38:44.572 --> 38:45.614
[both panting]

38:50.036 --> 38:53.247
Just like I said. All in the eyes.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.752
What would happen if you had
two spoonfuls of trout butter?

38:57.835 --> 39:00.338
I don't know,
but l'd be afraid to find out.

39:03.090 --> 39:07.678
-So... how'd you get the money?
-What?

39:07.762 --> 39:09.388
For <i>Hi, Zombie.</i> Production costs,
et cetera.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.016
Ever heard of the Space Needle?

39:12.224 --> 39:16.062
-Rings a bell.
-I sold the naming rights.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.440
Can the Chief of Staff
to a dead mayor do that?

39:19.523 --> 39:20.816
Oh, God, no.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.819
No, I figure I've got three, four months
before I'm discovered,

39:23.903 --> 39:26.781
the scandal breaks,
and my career bites the dust.

39:27.156 --> 39:27.990
So why?

39:29.158 --> 39:30.576
'Cause I'm not sure
we survive three months

39:30.659 --> 39:32.244
if we just sit back and do nothing.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.121
I've been to D.C., Ravi,

39:34.288 --> 39:37.792
and they are looking for an excuse
to wipe us off the map.

39:39.794 --> 39:43.297
I have never loved you more
than in this moment.

39:45.174 --> 39:48.177
Not even 45 seconds ago when we were--

39:48.260 --> 39:51.514
Okay, this moment is a close second.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.147
[Cathy] Just... I can't believe it.

40:00.523 --> 40:03.067
I mean, that was us. I mean, we did that.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.860
-[shushes]
-It was your plan.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.988
And the TV lied. Who were those people?

40:08.197 --> 40:12.034
Patsies. People our dear Commander
found to play the part.

40:12.201 --> 40:15.996
Well, that was my part.
We have to tell people they've been duped.

40:16.705 --> 40:19.750
And we know that, how?
Because we duped people first?

40:20.960 --> 40:21.794
Dolly, just please--

40:21.877 --> 40:27.383
No, no, no. I need you to say this
with me. "Dolly, I won't tell anyone."

40:28.217 --> 40:30.344
Okay, okay. Fine. I hear you.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.763
It's just that I stole blood
from the hospital for this.

40:33.055 --> 40:36.517
You know, I flailed around that car
like a damn epileptic, and for what?

40:36.600 --> 40:39.395
Everything they said on TV is fake news.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.648
People have gotta know.
We've gotta tell them, Dolly.

40:43.607 --> 40:47.903
You seem a little worked up, hon. Um,
why don't you let Benny drive you home?

40:48.237 --> 40:52.158
Take an Epsom bath.
Treat yourself, you know. You deserve it.

40:52.658 --> 40:54.577
-Yeah.
-Does Benny come with it?

40:56.245 --> 40:57.621
Well, that's up to Benny.

40:59.248 --> 41:01.125
Oh. Okay.

41:02.710 --> 41:06.505
So, tell me, uh, Benny,
is there a Mrs. Benny?

41:07.798 --> 41:09.175
[chuckling] Oh, no?

41:18.851 --> 41:20.853
[closing theme music playing]
