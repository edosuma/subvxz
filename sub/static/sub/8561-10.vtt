03:05.479 --> 03:10.984
It was three years since Lewis Nixon
and I decided to join the paratroops.

03:11.152 --> 03:14.153
And more than a year
since we went to war.

03:14.322 --> 03:19.198
Not knowing what would happen to us.
How long we'd be fighting.

03:19.369 --> 03:21.741
Where we'd end up.

03:21.913 --> 03:26.125
I certainly didn't expect to find
myself in a place like this.

03:29.588 --> 03:31.996
I thought it might be you.

03:34.969 --> 03:36.843
Morning.

03:38.139 --> 03:41.757
I heard reports about
a redheaded Eskimo.

03:42.769 --> 03:45.307
Thought I'd check it out.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.683
Come to join me for a morning swim?

03:49.735 --> 03:53.104
–Yeah.
–You know me so well.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.317
Here. It's from Zielinski.

03:57.159 --> 03:58.819
Oh, great.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.535
What is that?

04:04.834 --> 04:07.705
Ran into the regimental photographer.

04:07.879 --> 04:12.091
Said he had all these
photographs of the 506th…

04:12.259 --> 04:14.880
going all the way back to Toccoa.

04:15.053 --> 04:19.798
–I traded them for a couple of Lugers.
–That's a bargain.

04:30.278 --> 04:34.857
–What will you do after this?
–Get some breakfast.

04:37.369 --> 04:39.860
No. After, after.

04:44.835 --> 04:49.165
Funny you should mention it.
I had a meeting with Col. Sink.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.913
–Really?
–Yeah.

04:52.468 --> 04:56.418
Yeah, discussed the possibility
of staying.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.424
In the Army?

04:59.350 --> 05:02.636
Yeah. Yeah, as a career.

05:04.481 --> 05:06.521
What'd you say?

05:06.984 --> 05:09.190
I said I'd think about it.

05:18.830 --> 05:22.614
–What do you think about New Jersey?
–New Jersey?

05:22.792 --> 05:27.419
There's a company in Nixon, New Jersey
called Nixon Nitration Works.

05:27.589 --> 05:29.914
–Sounds picturesque.
–Yeah, well…

05:30.092 --> 05:33.295
oddly enough, I know the owners.

05:33.971 --> 05:37.838
Probably gonna expect me
to make something of myself.

05:38.058 --> 05:40.976
I thought maybe I'd drag you with me.

05:44.190 --> 05:47.310
Are you offering me a job?

05:50.655 --> 05:55.448
We'll see how your interview goes,
but a man of your qualifications…

05:55.619 --> 06:01.159
I think can scrape something up
commensurate with your current salary.

06:05.004 --> 06:07.460
Yeah, I'll think about it.

06:09.675 --> 06:13.376
I… I really appreciate it.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.723
Yeah, just think about it.

06:18.268 --> 06:19.846
Yeah.

06:52.346 --> 06:53.971
Job offers.

06:54.598 --> 06:56.390
Hard to fathom.

06:56.559 --> 06:59.346
And the war wasn't even over.

06:59.812 --> 07:04.309
I was still getting used
to hot showers and morning swims.

07:14.828 --> 07:19.844
We'd entered Bavaria in early May with
the hopes of capturing Berchtesgaden.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.828
This famous town, high in the Alps,
was the Nazi Party's symbolic home.

07:25.006 --> 07:28.090
The heads of the Third Reich
had houses there.

07:28.259 --> 07:31.628
Though Hitler was dead,
he had ordered the SS…

07:31.805 --> 07:36.633
to mount a guerilla resistance
against the Allied advance from it.

07:36.810 --> 07:40.855
The first step was blocking the roads.

07:45.861 --> 07:49.195
–When do the engineers arrive?
–Half an hour ago.

07:49.365 --> 07:52.117
We're stuck here until they do, Nix.

07:52.285 --> 07:56.449
If you're the SS, you won't
let us waltz into Hitler's house.

07:56.623 --> 07:58.699
Probably throw rocks yourself.

07:58.875 --> 08:02.042
Easy Company is willing
to find another way up.

08:02.337 --> 08:05.255
Duly noted.
I recommended you to Col. Sink.

08:05.424 --> 08:08.176
–Let's find out where Hitler lived.
–Ron.

08:08.344 --> 08:13.006
We don't know what's there. The
colonel doesn't want us taking risks.

08:13.182 --> 08:16.516
So the French will beat us
to the Eagle's Nest?

08:30.033 --> 08:32.738
I just had a talk with Gen. LeClerc.

08:32.910 --> 08:37.989
He said he was first into Paris and
wanted to be first into Berchtesgaden.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.914
Told him I understood his point.

08:44.716 --> 08:48.085
Now you outflank
that French son of a bitch.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.720
Yes, sir.

08:55.060 --> 08:58.061
Easy Company leads.
Assemble on the Autobahn.

08:58.230 --> 08:59.938
Yes, sir.

09:36.521 --> 09:38.015
Eerie.

09:38.857 --> 09:41.099
Not even any natives.

09:41.276 --> 09:45.440
That's because in this town
you can't deny being a true Nazi.

09:45.697 --> 09:49.067
–What do you mean?
–You have to be to live here.

09:49.243 --> 09:52.612
We need to find some place
we can put the colonel.

09:52.788 --> 09:55.161
How about right there?

10:23.446 --> 10:25.273
No, no.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.757
Wow.

10:59.151 --> 11:01.440
Kitty would love this.

11:01.612 --> 11:05.277
How many brides get
a wedding present from Hitler?

11:08.244 --> 11:10.283
You wanna take half?

11:10.454 --> 11:12.531
I can't carry all this.

11:12.707 --> 11:16.539
Whoever comes after us will take
what isn't nailed down.

11:16.711 --> 11:20.246
Well. Wouldn't want that to happen.

11:25.345 --> 11:28.549
–Nice.
–Don't even think about it.

11:37.900 --> 11:41.317
–Maj. Winters. Sir.
–More.

11:41.488 --> 11:45.153
–Permission to climb the mountain?
–What is this?

11:45.325 --> 11:47.318
Wait one minute.

11:47.786 --> 11:52.495
Have F Company guard the hotel.
Set up roadblocks west of town.

11:52.666 --> 11:56.664
I want Battalion HQ, seal the north,
prepare for prisoners.

11:56.837 --> 11:58.996
–Sgt Grant.
–And Harry…

11:59.340 --> 12:01.961
nobody gets hurt, not now.

12:04.345 --> 12:05.970
And Easy?

12:07.265 --> 12:10.515
Easy will head up through
the Obersalzburg…

12:10.685 --> 12:13.058
and take the Eagle's Nest.

12:15.566 --> 12:18.353
Hi-yo, Silver!

12:22.865 --> 12:25.652
Yeah! Currahee!

12:25.827 --> 12:30.987
The Eagle's Nest was Hitler's birthday
present, built with Nazi Party money.

12:31.291 --> 12:34.245
A mountaintop stone retreat
8000 feet up…

12:34.461 --> 12:37.130
accessible by
a gold-plated elevator.

12:37.297 --> 12:40.464
It was one of the crown jewels
of his empire…

12:40.634 --> 12:42.793
and he was afraid of heights.

13:29.686 --> 13:30.849
Here's to him.

13:45.745 --> 13:47.370
No, goddamn it, listen.

13:47.747 --> 13:49.491
Hitler, Hitler— No.

13:49.666 --> 13:56.084
Hitler, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels
and the Pope walk into a bar—

13:56.256 --> 13:59.922
–Because he drinks too much—
–That's how it starts.

14:00.177 --> 14:04.092
Hey, Adolf! Love your Eagle's Nest.
I hope you don't mind.

14:04.265 --> 14:09.342
We made ourselves at home. Love what
you did with the place. Have a drink.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.186
Come on. Just so we can say
we saw you do it.

14:13.358 --> 14:14.852
Listen up.

14:16.152 --> 14:22.274
From Corps, just came in. “All troops
stand fast on present positions.”

14:23.452 --> 14:26.453
–Standing fast.
–What does that mean?

14:27.623 --> 14:29.532
Wanna hear it?

14:30.793 --> 14:35.005
Ready for it? Listen up.
German army's surrendered.

14:41.137 --> 14:44.507
I got a present for you. Come on.

14:45.893 --> 14:48.099
Is it? Yeah?

15:08.792 --> 15:11.579
–What is this place?
–Goering's house.

15:11.753 --> 15:15.170
We found it yesterday.
Had it on guard since.

15:15.341 --> 15:18.377
–I'll vouch for that.
–Eager to get off duty?

15:18.552 --> 15:21.922
No, there's just so much
to see and do, sir.

15:57.302 --> 16:01.217
10·000 bottles of the finest
liquor, wine and champagne…

16:01.390 --> 16:05.435
helped Easy Company mark
the day the war in Europe ended.

16:05.603 --> 16:07.429
It's all yours.

16:08.230 --> 16:12.145
Take what you want and have
each company take a truckload.

16:12.777 --> 16:16.691
We're going to Austria.
You don't have to leave anything.

16:16.865 --> 16:19.616
–Austria, sir?
–Happy V-E Day.

16:21.244 --> 16:22.869
Yeah.

16:24.456 --> 16:26.365
V-E Day?

16:26.792 --> 16:29.497
Victory in Europe.

16:36.469 --> 16:38.925
Happy V-E Day.

16:41.266 --> 16:45.346
Instead of a combat unit,
we became an occupation force.

16:45.520 --> 16:49.767
No one wanted to leave Berchtesgaden.
Until they saw Austria.

17:26.814 --> 17:30.895
So you reckon they'll make us
run up those or ski down them?

17:49.463 --> 17:52.797
Hey, how are you? Need a hand there?

17:53.217 --> 17:55.969
Hi! Hi! He loves you.

17:56.304 --> 17:59.803
Hey, lady, how are you?

18:02.644 --> 18:05.681
I think the war is over!

18:38.349 --> 18:40.757
We'll be comfortable here.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.939
What will happen to us,
to people like you and me…

18:49.194 --> 18:53.903
when there are finally
no more wars to occupy us?

18:57.452 --> 18:59.576
Have your men collect weapons.

18:59.747 --> 19:02.913
Leave them at the church,
school and airfield.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.792
Very well.

19:12.218 --> 19:15.884
Please accept this as my
formal surrender, major.

19:16.056 --> 19:19.756
It is better than to lay it
on the desk of a clerk.

19:27.151 --> 19:30.105
You may keep your sidearm, colonel.

19:43.877 --> 19:48.290
Heroic Army and Marine force dead
mark the battlefield of Okinawa…

19:48.465 --> 19:51.466
where a bloody engagement
is being fought.

19:51.677 --> 19:56.470
Thousands of Yanks have been
wounded or sacrificed their lives…

19:56.641 --> 19:59.725
to drive a fanatical foe
from this base.

20:00.436 --> 20:06.605
The Yanks progress slowly, facing one
of the fiercest barrages of the war.

20:06.776 --> 20:11.818
Each advance is gained by sheer grit
in the face of withering fire…

20:11.990 --> 20:16.035
from a suicidal enemy being
hammered back into the hills.

20:16.203 --> 20:19.370
The going is brutal
and casualties are high…

20:19.582 --> 20:23.793
but Okinawa is the next
step towards victory over Japan.

20:24.003 --> 20:28.998
A victory that can only be won by
work, war bonds and heroic sacrifice.

20:36.016 --> 20:39.515
–So when are we going?
–We don't have a date yet.

20:39.686 --> 20:42.059
Are we to tell the men right away?

20:42.231 --> 20:44.556
Some have enough
points to go home.

20:44.733 --> 20:48.518
Not many, if their only
medal's a Purple Heart.

20:48.696 --> 20:51.946
I think most of us here
will have enough.

20:52.116 --> 20:57.277
Each of us will decide what to do.
I don't know how long we'll wait…

20:57.455 --> 21:02.663
but I want those who are staying,
and all replacements, ready to fight.

21:02.836 --> 21:06.205
That means rifle ranges.
Daily close-order drills.

21:06.382 --> 21:11.922
Troop reviews. Above all, physical
training. Get your NCOs on it.

21:13.389 --> 21:15.049
They're gonna love you.

21:19.354 --> 21:21.845
What are you crouching for, Perco?

21:22.023 --> 21:25.642
–Think the deer's gonna shoot back?
–Leave me alone.

21:25.819 --> 21:30.446
How about y'all just shut up.
Let Shifty kill us some dinner.

21:30.616 --> 21:34.945
What's wrong? Tired of eating
dried-up spuds three times a day?

21:35.121 --> 21:40.625
I got an idea. Why don't we just shoot
Bull and feed the company for a week?

22:08.573 --> 22:10.898
Oh, goddamn it, Shifty.

22:11.076 --> 22:15.287
You let him get away. Army ought
to be glad to be rid of you.

22:15.455 --> 22:18.871
I wish. Seems they want me
to stay around a while.

22:19.042 --> 22:21.418
–Serious?
–How many points you need?

22:21.587 --> 22:23.129
–Fifteen.
–Fifteen?

22:23.297 --> 22:26.915
Jesus Christ, I thought I had it bad.

22:27.093 --> 22:29.584
No Purple Hearts, never was injured.

22:29.762 --> 22:32.004
–Company!
–Platoon!

22:32.181 --> 22:34.554
Attention!

22:38.230 --> 22:39.973
Right shoulder…

22:40.482 --> 22:41.857
arms!

22:44.444 --> 22:45.987
Order…

22:46.655 --> 22:47.936
arms!

22:51.077 --> 22:52.785
At ease.

22:54.872 --> 22:59.166
Gen. Taylor knows many veterans,
including Normandy veterans…

22:59.335 --> 23:02.918
do not have the 85 points
needed to be discharged.

23:03.089 --> 23:07.170
On this anniversary of D-Day,
he authorized a lottery…

23:07.344 --> 23:11.638
to send one man home in each
company, effective immediately.

23:11.807 --> 23:15.425
For Easy Company, the winner is…

23:21.442 --> 23:23.435
Come on, come on, come on.

23:24.946 --> 23:29.359
serial number 13066266.

23:30.035 --> 23:34.744
–Sgt Darrell C. Powers.
–Shifty.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.876
That's how it's done, Shifty.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.085
Congratulations, Shifty.

23:42.256 --> 23:46.337
Sgt Grant will see 2nd Platoon
takes over the checkpoint…

23:46.552 --> 23:48.878
beginning tonight at 2200.

23:49.055 --> 23:51.677
–So much for our anniversary.
–No shit.

23:51.850 --> 23:55.800
Gen. Taylor also announced
the 101st Airborne Division…

23:55.979 --> 24:00.357
will definitely be redeployed
to the Pacific.

24:00.692 --> 24:07.063
So beginning tomorrow at 0600,
we will begin training to go to war.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.542
Come in.

24:23.592 --> 24:29.796
I don't mean to interrupt you, sir.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

24:30.641 --> 24:32.764
You know, you was…

24:34.812 --> 24:36.805
You was…

24:38.066 --> 24:42.360
Well, it's been a long time.

24:44.698 --> 24:48.446
–You got everything you need?
–I gathered up my loot.

24:48.869 --> 24:52.238
Pistols, mainly. Paperwork's all done.

24:52.414 --> 24:55.332
I even got my back pay in my pocket.

25:00.173 --> 25:03.127
Back home in Virginia…

25:05.929 --> 25:07.471
Well…

25:10.517 --> 25:14.930
I just don't rightly know
how I'm gonna explain all this.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.775
You see, I…

25:21.695 --> 25:25.314
I seen… I seen…

25:26.826 --> 25:30.029
You're a hell of a fine soldier,
Shifty.

25:30.330 --> 25:33.117
There's nothing more to explain.

25:36.169 --> 25:38.162
Thank you, sir.

25:46.347 --> 25:51.175
Two days later, Shifty Powers was
on a truck headed for a boat home.

25:51.352 --> 25:56.145
Unfortunately, the truck was hit
head-on by a drunken corporal.

25:56.316 --> 26:00.729
Shifty had a broken pelvis,
a broken arm and a bad concussion.

26:00.904 --> 26:04.819
He survived, but spent months
in a series of hospitals.

26:04.992 --> 26:08.692
I wish I could say he was
our only casualty in Austria.

26:08.871 --> 26:12.951
I've decided. I got the points,
I'm going back to Kitty.

26:13.125 --> 26:17.503
Do you really think Kitty hasn't
run off with some 4-F by now?

26:17.672 --> 26:21.088
Son of a bitch. That's not even funny.

26:21.259 --> 26:22.919
Harry, ignore him.

26:23.178 --> 26:28.932
How do I tell her I could have come
home, but decided to jump on Tokyo?

26:29.101 --> 26:32.102
All right, so don't tell her.

26:32.730 --> 26:38.566
She waited for three years. We'll
be back in two years, three tops.

26:38.736 --> 26:41.571
It'll be over before you get there.

26:41.739 --> 26:47.114
You'll be here six months waiting, and
I'll be in Wilkes-Barre making babies.

26:47.287 --> 26:50.323
–You didn't tell him?
–I couldn't shut him up.

26:51.708 --> 26:54.164
What? Tell me what?

26:54.544 --> 26:58.245
–Guts and Glory asked for a transfer.
–What?

26:58.632 --> 27:03.010
13th Airborne are heading out
for the Pacific right away.

27:05.890 --> 27:09.057
If I'm going,
I wanna get it over with.

27:11.229 --> 27:15.725
–Are you in on this?
–I can't let him go by himself.

27:18.820 --> 27:21.146
You're leaving the men?

27:22.908 --> 27:25.446
They don't need me anymore.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.500
Wounded in Normandy?

27:37.674 --> 27:41.802
Yes, sir. In the leg.
It was a minor flesh wound.

27:41.970 --> 27:45.920
–Company E lost 24 men killed there.
–Yes, sir.

27:46.683 --> 27:51.013
Seventeen were in my commander's
plane. It went down on D-Day.

27:51.522 --> 27:54.891
You were given command
of the company on D-Day?

27:55.067 --> 27:56.727
That's right.

28:06.246 --> 28:08.867
Fall back to your original positions!

28:09.041 --> 28:13.502
Everyone else maintain
your pace of fire!

28:22.346 --> 28:27.258
In Holland, they bumped you
to Battalion XO.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.770
Yes, sir.

28:33.900 --> 28:37.104
Bastards took your company away.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.305
I fired my last shots there.

29:08.562 --> 29:10.804
For the whole damn war?

29:11.315 --> 29:12.975
Yes, sir.

29:14.986 --> 29:18.604
You got through Bastogne
without firing your weapon?

29:18.782 --> 29:20.240
That is correct, sir.

29:20.408 --> 29:24.620
–You were on the line the whole time?
–Yes, sir.

29:27.207 --> 29:30.327
Can't imagine a tougher test
for a leader.

29:30.502 --> 29:35.212
Having to sit through a siege
like that, under those conditions.

29:35.383 --> 29:38.253
–We got through it.
–Find some cover!

29:38.428 --> 29:42.591
Find some cover! Find a foxhole!
Come on, take cover!

29:43.933 --> 29:45.807
Take cover!

29:50.440 --> 29:53.110
Come on, find some cover!

29:56.238 --> 29:59.939
–So why do you want a transfer?
–Sorry, sir?

30:00.451 --> 30:02.942
Why do you want to leave your men?

30:03.121 --> 30:08.875
It's not that. If the war was still on
and I could do some good…

30:09.044 --> 30:12.164
Looking to have your own division
some day?

30:12.339 --> 30:13.619
No, sir.

30:13.799 --> 30:16.966
–Not gonna make a career of the Army?
–No.

30:17.136 --> 30:20.421
Ye— Well, I don't know, sir.

30:21.432 --> 30:26.937
If you think you need more experience
to get stars on your helmet…

30:27.104 --> 30:30.106
let me tell you something, son:

30:30.275 --> 30:32.563
You've done enough.

30:34.738 --> 30:37.655
Thank you, sir.
That's not my objective.

30:45.541 --> 30:49.455
I took this meeting out of respect
for your achievements.

30:49.628 --> 30:51.586
And for the 101st.

30:52.507 --> 30:56.172
If they do go
to the Pacific eventually…

30:56.344 --> 30:59.511
you should be running
one of the battalions.

31:00.807 --> 31:02.551
Thank you, sir.

31:04.645 --> 31:08.477
And frankly, your men earned
the right to keep you around.

31:14.864 --> 31:16.358
Yes, sir.

31:17.241 --> 31:18.949
Thank you, sir.

31:23.957 --> 31:28.370
I would stay in Austria for the time
being, waiting for orders…

31:28.545 --> 31:32.625
and trying to watch over soldiers
with no enemy to fight.

31:32.800 --> 31:37.261
–Lieb, I fucking hate this.
–Oh, Jesus Christ. They fingered him.

31:37.429 --> 31:42.222
One of the Polacks at the slave camps
said this is where he lives.

31:42.393 --> 31:44.552
–Which camp?
–Whatever camp.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.724
I'm under direct orders
and I'm happy to follow it.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.453
–Is this a personal thing, Joe?
–What?

32:11.633 --> 32:15.547
–Is this personal to you?
–No, it's a goddamn order.

32:15.720 --> 32:19.054
–Does Maj. Winters know?
–Doesn't matter.

32:19.224 --> 32:25.559
The fuck it doesn't. What if he's just
a soldier? What if he's innocent?

32:25.731 --> 32:28.518
What if he's commandant
of a slave camp?

32:28.692 --> 32:31.314
Which camp? You don't have any proof.

32:31.487 --> 32:33.646
Were you at Landsberg?

32:33.823 --> 32:35.365
You know I was.

32:35.533 --> 32:41.702
Think he's a soldier like you and me?
A fucking innocent German officer?

32:41.873 --> 32:45.207
Where the hell you been
for the past three years?

32:51.800 --> 32:53.211
What?

32:54.553 --> 32:56.012
Shut up.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.525
Don't fucking lie to me.

33:17.286 --> 33:20.786
See what you did to my fucking people!

33:21.082 --> 33:22.706
That's it.

33:49.404 --> 33:51.028
He's guilty.

33:53.533 --> 33:57.317
–Liebgott says so.
–He probably is.

34:05.379 --> 34:06.838
Damn son of a bitch.

34:07.006 --> 34:08.583
Shoot him.

34:10.051 --> 34:11.675
–Shoot him!
–No.

34:34.994 --> 34:40.581
–Officers don't run.
–The war's over. Anybody would run.

34:42.585 --> 34:46.417
Summer in this Alpine paradise
should've been a relief.

34:46.590 --> 34:51.501
Especially now that we were at peace.
Everyone just wanted to go home.

34:51.678 --> 34:54.964
–France. France was the best.
–Really?

34:55.139 --> 34:56.717
Yeah.

34:56.891 --> 35:03.013
Five years. I think I was in every
country, but France was the best.

35:07.528 --> 35:11.858
Italy would be second for me.
Russia is not desirable.

35:12.033 --> 35:14.785
Ukraine, it was okay.

35:15.662 --> 35:18.200
So when do you get out?

35:18.373 --> 35:23.036
The unit is discharged. We leave
when my captain gets transferred.

35:23.212 --> 35:26.628
–It is the end of my second war.
–Jesus!

35:26.799 --> 35:30.417
–I'm going home, to Mannheim.
–I'll take this one.

35:35.433 --> 35:36.892
Okay.

35:41.898 --> 35:44.105
Hey, Webster. My relief.

35:44.276 --> 35:48.855
–Don't salute the Germans.
–Come on. I get a kick out of it.

35:49.031 --> 35:52.365
Anyway, I got me a new enemy.
The Japs.

35:52.535 --> 35:56.948
Seventy-five points. How about you?
You're a Toccoa guy, right?

35:57.123 --> 36:00.208
–How many you got?
–Wouldn't you like to know?

36:03.505 --> 36:05.462
Discharged, huh?

36:06.591 --> 36:10.921
–Go ahead, take off. It's my turn.
–Okay. See you at the farm.

36:12.723 --> 36:14.467
Eighty-one.

36:16.227 --> 36:18.266
I have 81 points.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.971
Well, that's just not good enough.

36:28.281 --> 36:30.951
See about getting you a ride.

36:31.159 --> 36:34.659
Hey. Hey. Where are they going?

36:34.830 --> 36:36.289
Munich.

36:37.958 --> 36:39.916
Wanna go to Munich?

36:51.473 --> 36:52.801
Get in.

36:54.518 --> 36:55.680
Too bad.

37:01.442 --> 37:02.984
Turn the wheel!

37:05.905 --> 37:08.063
Oh, Jesus.

37:21.129 --> 37:23.205
It's Pvt. Janovec.

37:26.301 --> 37:28.923
He was dead when they brought him in.

37:32.433 --> 37:34.675
Seventy-five points.

37:35.061 --> 37:37.932
–What?
–He was 10 points short.

37:39.858 --> 37:44.484
The enemy had surrendered,
but somehow men were still dying.

37:44.654 --> 37:47.146
Men who wanted to be home by now…

37:47.324 --> 37:52.781
who'd served since before Normandy,
were stuck because they lacked points.

37:52.955 --> 37:59.243
They did have plenty of weapons,
alcohol and time on their hands.

37:59.879 --> 38:04.588
Suddenly, from out of nowhere,
a guy jumps out of the hedgerow…

38:04.759 --> 38:10.002
shoves a knife against his throat
and screams, “Whose side are you on?”

38:10.849 --> 38:12.130
I don't get it.

38:12.309 --> 38:15.678
It's D-Day.
It's 2nd Platoon's own Bill Guarnere.

38:15.854 --> 38:20.267
Old Gonorrhea himself. Just landed
in Normandy and all wound up.

38:20.443 --> 38:22.768
“Whose side?” What a character.

38:23.154 --> 38:24.897
What happened to him?

38:25.740 --> 38:28.741
Got his leg blown off in Bastogne.

38:29.744 --> 38:30.907
Wait here.

38:36.877 --> 38:39.582
You okay, Mac?
You need some help?

38:45.970 --> 38:48.971
They wouldn't give me any gas.

38:49.265 --> 38:50.890
Krauts.

38:56.189 --> 38:58.229
I tried to explain.

38:59.734 --> 39:03.567
This fucking limey wouldn't listen.

39:04.615 --> 39:06.987
I think he was a major.

39:07.159 --> 39:11.204
–Look, private, we got a problem here.
–Do you have any gas?

39:11.914 --> 39:14.322
Why don't you give me your weapon?

39:15.126 --> 39:20.369
Well, I guess I'll just use his jeep.
I don't think he's gonna need it.

39:20.548 --> 39:22.671
Hold on a second, all right?

39:24.135 --> 39:25.594
Jesus!

39:25.762 --> 39:28.680
Sarge! Sgt Grant!

39:31.477 --> 39:33.054
Sarge!

39:40.486 --> 39:43.571
–Jesus.
–What?

39:43.740 --> 39:45.779
He's not gonna make it.

39:45.950 --> 39:49.154
–You can't operate?
–You'd need a brain surgeon.

39:49.329 --> 39:53.197
And even if you had one,
I don't think there's any hope.

39:56.545 --> 40:01.753
Find the shooter, alive. Help me.
We're gonna go find a brain surgeon.

40:04.303 --> 40:09.725
He wants noncoms guarding roadblocks
and men watching roads out of town.

40:09.893 --> 40:13.807
Bull, Malark, take a squad
and a witness to search houses.

40:13.980 --> 40:18.144
–Can we shoot this bastard on sight?
–Try and take him alive.

40:18.318 --> 40:19.729
Where's Grant now?

40:19.903 --> 40:23.948
They took him to a Kraut hospital
to find a good doctor.

40:33.042 --> 40:34.620
Open up.

40:39.257 --> 40:40.586
Come with me.

40:40.759 --> 40:43.001
–Why?
–Get in the jeep.

40:46.140 --> 40:49.509
–Where are we going?
–To the hospital. Get in.

40:50.603 --> 40:54.553
If you're going to shoot, shoot.
If not, put the gun away.

40:54.732 --> 40:56.476
Get in the jeep, now.

40:57.402 --> 41:00.605
–What happened to him?
–He was shot in the head.

41:01.614 --> 41:03.441
Half-hour ago.

41:04.534 --> 41:07.785
–Come on.
–If you want him to live, help me.

41:07.954 --> 41:11.039
First, by putting that away.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.166
–Let's go.
–Let me drive.

41:15.337 --> 41:17.911
We'll get there faster.

41:25.807 --> 41:28.891
All right, see what we got here.

41:30.103 --> 41:33.519
Jesus. Again, what a hand.

41:36.276 --> 41:40.820
–Who's being beaten worse, me or him?
–Wanna play a different game?

41:40.990 --> 41:43.907
Same game, just shuffle
them up good, huh?

41:46.954 --> 41:49.825
–You all right?
–Yeah, I'm all right.

41:50.750 --> 41:53.372
Wanna go in there and join in?

41:54.838 --> 41:56.877
I should go in and stop this.

41:57.090 --> 42:00.673
Floyd, let's just play cards,
all right?

42:06.392 --> 42:08.183
–Where is he?
–How's Grant?

42:08.352 --> 42:10.808
–He okay?
–Where is he⁈

42:20.824 --> 42:22.484
This him?

42:23.535 --> 42:25.195
That's him.

42:27.664 --> 42:30.334
Replacement. I Company.

42:31.794 --> 42:33.870
Where's the weapon?

42:35.464 --> 42:37.422
What weapon?

42:39.344 --> 42:42.795
When you talk to an officer,
you say “sir”.

43:33.109 --> 43:36.728
Have the MPs take care
of this piece of shit.

43:38.073 --> 43:40.529
–Grant's dead?
–No.

43:42.077 --> 43:44.995
Kraut surgeon says he's gonna make it.

43:48.417 --> 43:51.952
Hey, tough guy, on your feet.
Come on, move.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.754
Get up!

43:54.215 --> 43:59.755
I guess they were Hitler's photo
albums. Had a lot of pictures of him.

43:59.930 --> 44:02.765
–You didn't take them?
–That's right, sir.

44:02.933 --> 44:04.972
I don't believe you!

44:10.149 --> 44:13.814
I'll be watching you.
You're dismissed.

44:16.906 --> 44:19.397
You better not be lying to me.

44:24.748 --> 44:27.155
–What?
–Sir…

44:27.334 --> 44:30.086
if it's not gonna put you
in a bind…

44:30.254 --> 44:33.919
I'd like to resign as
company first sergeant.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.584
If I had my choice,
I miss being back amongst the men.

44:38.763 --> 44:43.092
I'd be happy to go to staff sergeant,
wherever you wanna put me.

44:47.397 --> 44:51.229
I guess you've earned your right
to demote yourself.

44:51.401 --> 44:53.026
Thank you, sir.

44:54.279 --> 44:58.941
–Wanna take over Sgt Grant's platoon?
–That would do fine, sir.

45:02.913 --> 45:06.579
All right then, report to Lt Peacock.

45:08.544 --> 45:11.214
Let me know if he gives you
any trouble.

45:13.007 --> 45:15.677
Oh, sir, you make your decision yet?

45:15.927 --> 45:17.470
Yeah, I did.

45:25.437 --> 45:28.189
So, what else is on your mind?

45:28.733 --> 45:32.316
Easy Company will need
a commanding officer postwar.

45:32.487 --> 45:35.938
Somebody to keep them
from killing each other.

45:36.115 --> 45:39.117
That somebody better know
what they're doing.

45:39.285 --> 45:40.780
I couldn't agree more.

45:40.954 --> 45:44.904
It's irresponsible to leave them
in the wrong hands.

45:45.083 --> 45:48.784
They're too much of a valuable
resource to the military.

45:52.466 --> 45:54.839
You've decided to stay in the Army?

45:55.219 --> 45:57.461
Yes, I'm gonna stay with the men.

45:59.307 --> 46:01.513
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

46:04.437 --> 46:07.107
So some of us would stay by choice.

46:07.274 --> 46:11.446
Others were stuck, unless we could
find excuses to send them away.

46:11.486 --> 46:16.694
It's an airborne exhibition. They have
each Allied plane used in the war.

46:16.867 --> 46:18.196
Uh-huh.

46:18.494 --> 46:19.774
I mean, yes, sir.

46:19.954 --> 46:23.655
You'll be an adviser
to make sure they get it right.

46:23.833 --> 46:27.831
–I understand, sir.
–Sorry it's not a hospitable location.

46:28.004 --> 46:33.129
No, Paris is just fine, if you need me
to go. Someone has to be there.

46:33.301 --> 46:35.378
We do. We absolutely do.

46:35.554 --> 46:39.848
Your driver will drop you off
at a hotel of your choice…

46:40.017 --> 46:44.394
and I don't think we'll see you
back here anytime soon.

46:44.563 --> 46:46.805
I won't let you down, sir.

47:00.747 --> 47:03.120
Carwood, yes…

47:03.292 --> 47:08.915
You probably know, when the Army gives
a man a battlefield commission…

47:09.090 --> 47:13.337
they usually don't let him stay
with the same company.

47:13.511 --> 47:16.132
Yes, sir. I figured this was coming.

47:16.389 --> 47:21.217
They're afraid the men won't respect
him as they would another officer.

47:21.394 --> 47:23.471
Yeah. It's a good theory, sir.

47:23.647 --> 47:26.518
It's idiotic. Especially in your case.

47:26.692 --> 47:30.986
Nevertheless, they've let me choose
where to reassign you.

47:31.155 --> 47:34.856
I thought Battalion Headquarters
might be a good place.

47:35.034 --> 47:37.607
I can think of few better, sir.

47:37.787 --> 47:40.159
Good. Good.

47:41.082 --> 47:45.412
Right now, down at the airfield
there is a German general…

47:45.587 --> 47:49.916
angry about having to surrender
to Pvt. Heffron from Philly.

47:50.092 --> 47:52.962
–It's beneath his stature.
–Understandable.

47:53.387 --> 47:57.716
Yeah. I thought 2nd Lt Carwood Lipton
from West Virginia…

47:57.892 --> 48:01.890
could soothe his ruffled feathers.
–No problem, sir.

48:02.063 --> 48:06.061
Major, is this the type of job
I can expect from now on?

48:08.194 --> 48:12.441
Yeah. Yeah. When we're not
sunning ourselves by the lake.

48:23.085 --> 48:24.496
Lieutenant.

48:33.721 --> 48:37.055
With your permission,
I'd like to address my men.

48:37.225 --> 48:39.763
That'll be fine, general.

48:49.530 --> 48:51.737
–Capt. Sobel.
–Maj. Winters.

48:51.908 --> 48:53.022
Capt. Sobel.

48:55.119 --> 48:58.239
We salute the rank, not the man.

49:22.524 --> 49:23.899
Liebgott?

49:25.443 --> 49:29.276
Men, it's been a long war,
it's been a tough war.

49:32.784 --> 49:37.696
You have fought bravely,
proudly, for your country.

49:41.043 --> 49:43.416
You are a special group…

49:46.591 --> 49:49.129
who found in one another
a bond…

49:54.558 --> 49:56.800
that exists only in combat…

49:58.645 --> 50:00.519
among brothers…

50:02.399 --> 50:04.392
of shared foxholes.

50:09.615 --> 50:12.189
Held each other in dire moments.

50:19.835 --> 50:23.168
Have seen death
and suffered together.

50:30.554 --> 50:34.766
I am proud to have served
with each and every one of you.

50:40.190 --> 50:44.235
You deserve long and happy lives
in peace.

50:59.710 --> 51:01.335
Towel, towel, towel!

51:02.422 --> 51:03.964
Thanks.

51:04.340 --> 51:06.499
Take a look at these two kids.

51:07.719 --> 51:10.341
What the hell happened to them?

51:11.139 --> 51:13.216
New Jersey, huh?

51:15.018 --> 51:16.299
Yeah.

51:16.937 --> 51:18.348
Think about it.

51:19.106 --> 51:20.766
Yeah, I am.

51:22.777 --> 51:24.651
You awake yet?

51:25.947 --> 51:27.406
Awake?

51:28.867 --> 51:30.694
Time to go to bed.

51:45.551 --> 51:47.211
Come on, Jimmy.

51:49.180 --> 51:51.552
–Nice play.
–We got one down.

51:51.724 --> 51:56.470
–Come on, Pee Wee. Get Webster.
–Come on, Pee Wee, let's get him.

51:57.772 --> 52:01.605
Buck Compton came back
to let us know he was all right.

52:01.777 --> 52:04.398
He became a prosecutor in Los Angeles.

52:04.571 --> 52:07.608
He convicted Sirhan Sirhan…

52:07.783 --> 52:12.077
and was later appointed
to the California Court of Appeals.

52:12.747 --> 52:17.128
David Webster wrote for The Saturday
Evening Post and Wall Street Journal…

52:17.168 --> 52:19.659
and later wrote a book about sharks.

52:19.838 --> 52:26.505
In 1961, he went out on the ocean
alone, and was never seen again.

52:29.556 --> 52:31.430
Go, go, go! Yeah!

52:31.934 --> 52:35.268
Johnny Martin would return
to his railroad job…

52:35.438 --> 52:37.976
and then start
a construction company.

52:38.149 --> 52:42.361
He splits his time between Arizona
and a place in Montana.

52:44.739 --> 52:49.200
George Luz became a handyman
in Providence, RI.

52:49.369 --> 52:52.821
And as a testament to his character…

52:53.040 --> 52:57.203
1600 people attended
his funeral in 1998.

52:58.045 --> 53:02.956
Doc Roe died in Louisiana in 1998.

53:03.676 --> 53:06.250
He'd been a construction contractor.

53:08.431 --> 53:13.473
Frank Perconte returned to Chicago and
worked a postal route as a mailman.

53:20.110 --> 53:24.903
Joe Liebgott returned to San Francisco
and drove his cab.

53:26.826 --> 53:30.776
Bull Randleman was one
of the best soldiers I ever had.

53:30.955 --> 53:36.542
He went into the earth-moving business
in Arkansas. He's still there.

53:43.385 --> 53:47.169
Alton More returned to Wyoming
with a unique souvenir:

53:47.348 --> 53:50.302
Hitler's personal photo albums.

53:50.476 --> 53:54.474
He was killed in a car accident
in 1958.

53:55.732 --> 53:58.851
Floyd Talbert we all
lost touch with…

53:59.027 --> 54:04.069
until he showed up at a reunion
just before his death in 1981.

54:05.742 --> 54:11.117
How we lived our lives after the war
was as varied as each man.

54:11.790 --> 54:16.666
Carwood Lipton became an executive
directing factories across the world.

54:16.837 --> 54:19.838
He has a nice life in North Carolina.

54:20.091 --> 54:22.629
Harry Welsh, he married Kitty Grogan.

54:22.802 --> 54:27.595
Became an administrator for the
Wilkes-Barre, PA school system.

54:30.310 --> 54:33.762
Ronald Speirs stayed in the Army,
served in Korea.

54:33.939 --> 54:38.685
In 1958, returned to Germany
as governor of Spandau Prison.

54:38.861 --> 54:41.779
He retired a lieutenant colonel.

54:46.411 --> 54:49.246
–Get them round.
–All right, Webster.

54:49.414 --> 54:52.166
Easy Company. School circle!

54:58.632 --> 55:02.416
For Easy Company,
it was D-Day plus 434.

55:02.594 --> 55:05.679
A fast man would've had it, Perco.

55:05.848 --> 55:08.339
Listen up. Got some news.

55:09.894 --> 55:15.481
Today, President Truman received
the surrender from the Japanese.

55:16.067 --> 55:17.727
War's over.

55:19.571 --> 55:22.358
Regardless of points, medals
or wounds…

55:22.574 --> 55:26.239
each man in the 101st Airborne
would be going home.

55:27.287 --> 55:31.748
Each of us would be forever connected
by our shared experience.

55:32.251 --> 55:36.331
And each would have to rejoin
the world as best he could.

55:51.730 --> 55:54.566
Lewis Nixon had tough times
after the war.

55:54.733 --> 55:56.975
He was divorced a few times.

55:57.153 --> 56:01.815
In 1956 he married a woman named
Grace and everything came together.

56:01.991 --> 56:05.195
He spent his life with her,
traveling the world.

56:05.370 --> 56:09.498
My friend Lew died in 1995.

56:10.208 --> 56:14.705
I took his job offer and was a manager
at Nixon Nitration Works…

56:14.880 --> 56:19.044
until I was called into service
in 1950 to train officers.

56:19.218 --> 56:23.465
I chose not to go to Korea.
I'd had enough of war.

56:23.639 --> 56:27.969
I stayed around Hershey, PA,
finally finding a little farm…

56:28.144 --> 56:32.723
a little peaceful corner of the
world, where I still live today.

56:32.899 --> 56:38.321
And not a day goes by that I do not
think of the men I served with…

56:38.488 --> 56:42.237
who never got to enjoy the world
without war.

56:42.409 --> 56:46.407
It's a very unusual feeling.

56:47.790 --> 56:51.788
It's a very unusual happening
and a very unusual bonding.

56:51.961 --> 56:54.001
We could depend on each other.

56:55.381 --> 56:58.003
And so we were a close-knit group.

56:58.176 --> 57:00.667
So brave, it was unbelievable.

57:02.055 --> 57:04.760
I don't know anybody I admire more…

57:04.933 --> 57:08.848
than Bill Guarnere and Joe Toye.

57:09.688 --> 57:11.847
They were very special.

57:12.024 --> 57:15.690
I'm just one part of the big war.
One little part.

57:17.071 --> 57:22.314
And I'm proud to be a part of it.
Sometimes it makes me cry.

57:22.535 --> 57:25.073
The real men, the real heroes…

57:26.456 --> 57:30.157
are those buried over there
and buried at home.

57:30.544 --> 57:34.328
You thought you could do
just about anything.

57:34.506 --> 57:36.084
After the war…

57:37.468 --> 57:42.177
you lost a lot of that. At least I did.
I lost that confidence.

57:42.348 --> 57:45.848
You was hoping to stay alive.
That's all.

57:48.021 --> 57:51.770
Henry V was talking
to his men.

57:51.942 --> 57:54.349
He said, “From this day…

57:54.528 --> 57:57.399
”to the ending of the world…

57:57.573 --> 58:00.989
”we in it shall be remembered.

58:01.160 --> 58:05.288
”We lucky few, we band of brothers.

58:05.456 --> 58:09.454
”For he who today
sheds his blood with me…

58:09.627 --> 58:11.287
shall be my brother”.

58:12.839 --> 58:14.832
Do you remember…

58:16.927 --> 58:20.378
the letter that Mike Ranney wrote me?

58:20.556 --> 58:21.670
You do?

58:21.849 --> 58:24.766
Do you remember how he ended it?

58:26.145 --> 58:29.479
“I cherish the memories…

58:29.649 --> 58:33.896
”of a question my grandson
asked me the other day…

58:34.070 --> 58:39.491
”when he said, "Grandpa,
were you a hero in the war?"

58:42.204 --> 58:44.825
”Grandpa said,  "No…

58:48.794 --> 58:52.459
but I served in a company
of heroes."”

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
