WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.636
Tomorrow night is
the one-year anniversary

00:02.735 --> 00:03.671
of our first date.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.005
I have something
special planned.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.574
He promised
it would be a night

00:06.674 --> 00:07.575
I'd remember forever.

00:08.409 --> 00:09.110
Are you thinking
the "one other thing"

00:09.777 --> 00:10.644
is what
I'm thinking it is?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.780
I'm sorry, but that
special surprise is off.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.216
What?
You can't show Night of
 the Living Dead in November.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.717
That was your special surprise?

00:16.817 --> 00:18.719
Yeah, got you, right?

00:18.819 --> 00:20.154
We are not going
to get together.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.422
Lavon would break
my kneecaps.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.325
I'm going to wear you
down, George Tucker.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.768
Good morning.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.338
What you reading?

00:37.438 --> 00:38.506
A medical journal.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.774
Mm. Sounds hot.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.510
Hmm.
Tell me more
about it.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.112
Well, it turns out

00:44.212 --> 00:46.547
that high blood
glucose levels

00:46.647 --> 00:48.316
are tied to dementia.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.450
Mmm.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.418
(giggles)

00:52.120 --> 00:53.421
(blowing kazoo)

00:53.521 --> 00:54.655
What is
happening?!

00:54.755 --> 00:56.056
Congratulations!

00:56.157 --> 00:58.292
You two are now officially

00:58.392 --> 01:00.794
the longest guests at
the Whippoorwill Blossom.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.463
Breakfast is on the house.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.564
Dash.
(laughs)

01:03.664 --> 01:04.798
Oh... well...

01:04.897 --> 01:06.434
We are both honored
and humbled

01:06.534 --> 01:08.336
by the magnitude
of our achievement,

01:08.436 --> 01:09.603
but, you know, we've
been over this before,

01:09.703 --> 01:11.672
the whole knocking thing.
It's really simple.

01:11.772 --> 01:12.840
You just...
you ball your fist,

01:12.940 --> 01:14.608
and go like this.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.477
Well, I...

01:17.845 --> 01:19.247
I think it
might be time

01:19.347 --> 01:20.714
for us to find
our own place.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.650
Oh, but looking
for a house to rent

01:22.750 --> 01:23.817
is such a hassle.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.819
And this place
is so comfy.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.257
(laughs)

01:29.357 --> 01:30.691
(camera shutter clicks)

01:30.791 --> 01:31.825
(gasps) What?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.494
Just a photo
for the brochure.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.695
(Dash chuckles)

01:34.795 --> 01:36.364
Please, resume canoodling!

01:36.464 --> 01:37.365
(door shuts)

01:38.232 --> 01:39.233
Let's start looking
this afternoon.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.403
Man, we got
so many Lincolns,

01:42.503 --> 01:44.638
old Jeff Davis gonna be
rolling over in his grave.

01:44.738 --> 01:45.739
I must say,
Wade Kinsella,

01:45.839 --> 01:46.840
we've become
quite the team.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.842
We have grown 20%
this quarter.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.378
I know just what to do
with the extra dough.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.346
Okay, enough with
the go-go dancers.
No.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.448
We need a radio ad
with a jingle.

01:55.383 --> 01:56.684
It could play
all over this state.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.818
We could bring more tourists in.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.520
Wade, that is
a great idea.

02:00.921 --> 02:01.622
Good, 'cause I've actually
already been working
on a loose version.

02:02.856 --> 02:03.657
The only problem is,
there's not a lot
of positive words

02:04.358 --> 02:05.726
that rhyme with
"jammer."

02:05.826 --> 02:07.228
Basically, "hammer,"

02:07.328 --> 02:09.763
"slammer,"
"stammer..."

02:09.863 --> 02:11.265
Okay.
You'll think of something.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.533
Who's your partner?

02:12.633 --> 02:13.534
That's me.
(whoops)

02:13.634 --> 02:14.535
That's me.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.304
Ooh-wee.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.538
When you are finished dancing,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.407
you might want to tend
to the kitchen.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.442
Shanetta's started
another fire.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.643
What?

02:22.743 --> 02:23.744
(coughing)

02:26.847 --> 02:28.282
(sighs)

02:30.484 --> 02:31.719
A.B.!

02:31.819 --> 02:32.720
You're back?

02:32.820 --> 02:34.188
I was about to have
Sheriff Bill

02:34.288 --> 02:35.556
get a posse together
to come look for you.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.891
I told you, I was
visiting my sister.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.327
True, but...

02:39.427 --> 02:41.262
any time anyone says
they're excited

02:41.362 --> 02:43.431
to hang out with family,
I assume it's like

02:43.531 --> 02:44.898
one of those hostage
video statements.

02:44.998 --> 02:45.699
Nope.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.201
No off-screen
gunmen, just...

02:47.301 --> 02:49.337
visiting
my sister.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.574
Is everything okay
with you and Lavon?

02:53.674 --> 02:54.842
Yeah, why?

02:54.942 --> 02:56.277
Well, he just said
that he's going

02:56.377 --> 02:57.578
to a bachelor party
this weekend in Vegas

02:57.678 --> 02:59.713
with NFL buddies
and that you're fine with it.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.715
I am.
Why wouldn't I be?

03:01.815 --> 03:02.850
I don't know.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.818
Bachelor party.
Vegas.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.920
NFL buddies.
Vegas.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.656
Ladies.
Hi.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.824
Did you know that you have
 the coolest girlfriend?

03:10.924 --> 03:12.426
It's true.
He does.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.862
This is about
the bachelor
party, isn't it?

03:14.962 --> 03:16.297
Well, don't worry
about it.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.598
I'm thinking
about bailing

03:17.698 --> 03:18.599
on the whole thing.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.733
What?

03:19.833 --> 03:20.734
Why?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.570
Those guys get
pretty wild.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.938
I mean, the schedule
is all... club,

03:25.038 --> 03:26.874
another club,
strip club,

03:26.974 --> 03:28.742
steal a tiger from
Mike Tyson, repeat.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.777
Not my thing.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.613
It should be your thing.
At least for this weekend.

03:33.814 --> 03:34.782
I'll see you
Sunday night.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.484
I have to get to work, okay?

03:40.288 --> 03:41.889
Okay, I...
I may be wrong,

03:41.989 --> 03:44.258
but did A.B. just
hand me a stack of ones

03:44.358 --> 03:45.759
and say, "Enjoy
the strip clubs"?

03:45.859 --> 03:48.329
You're a lucky man.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.366
Oh!
George.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.768
Hey.
Haven't seen you
in days.

03:54.868 --> 03:55.969
How are your goods?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.237
Still damaged?

03:57.338 --> 03:59.773
Uh... no, the goods,
they're... good.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.709
Um... oh!
Uh, before I forget,

04:01.809 --> 04:03.243
I have something
for you.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.813
You left this
on my houseboat

04:05.913 --> 04:06.914
and I know the LSATs
are coming up,

04:07.014 --> 04:07.981
so I thought
you might need it.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.350
Well, thank you.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.787
Was there something else?

04:13.887 --> 04:15.356
No.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.725
Have a good day.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.394
George, how long have
you had this, anyway?

04:21.495 --> 04:22.930
You could've dropped
this book off

04:23.030 --> 04:24.565
at my front door
anytime.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.266
Or in my
mailbox.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.502
Or left it
with Lavon.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.003
Yeah, I could've
done that.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.672
But then you wouldn't
have had the excuse

04:31.772 --> 04:32.806
to talk to me,
right?

04:32.906 --> 04:33.807
(coughs)
No, Lynly.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.275
I... mmm.
I'm not looking

04:35.376 --> 04:36.544
for an excuse
to talk to you.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.811
Okay?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.780
If you say so,
George.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.016
But...

04:43.116 --> 04:44.385
ZOE:
Come on, Babs.

04:45.386 --> 04:45.886
There has to be a house
that's a little nicer.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.821
Less...
infested.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.890
Well, turnover in
BlueBell is low.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.326
You gotta wait for
the right property

04:52.426 --> 04:53.661
to come along.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.028
Like a good man.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.831
Sometimes it takes
a long...

04:57.931 --> 05:00.368
long...

05:00.468 --> 05:01.602
long, long time.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.970
Hey, Ernie Cooper's
old house is for rent?

05:03.070 --> 05:04.838
This place
is great.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.575
No, this one's
not for you.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.443
Oh, no. I've done
house calls here before.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.844
This place
is amazing.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.513
Of course
it's for us.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.347
Oh!

05:14.081 --> 05:15.082
Look at the light
in that study.

05:16.083 --> 05:16.550
Look, honey, the owner
might not rent to you.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.018
I'm the town doctor.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.019
Who wouldn't rent to me?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.521
Winifred Wilkes.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.755
Wilkes.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.990
As in...
Harley Wilkes?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.458
My dead father?

05:24.558 --> 05:25.893
Winifred was
Harley's first cousin.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.994
Hey!
You're related.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.328
Family discount.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.532
There's a small, tiny,

05:31.632 --> 05:34.668
eensy chance
it could go the other way.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.669
How eensy?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.837
100%.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.842
Kitchen's running
slow again.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.545
You want to come back here
and say that to my face?

05:44.645 --> 05:45.479
No.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.784
Oh, my gosh!

05:50.884 --> 05:53.353
What is Edward doing here?

05:53.454 --> 05:54.588
Quick, go get the good silver.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.889
And I mean the clean stuff.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.825
Hurry, hurry.

05:59.627 --> 06:00.628
Edward.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.030
The owner of Fancie's
doesn't patronize

06:03.130 --> 06:04.565
our humble restaurant
every day.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.933
To what do we
owe the honor?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.701
I'm here
to see you.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.036
Oh. Little ol' me?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.004
Why?

06:11.104 --> 06:12.506
I am so impressed

06:12.606 --> 06:14.408
with what you have
done to this place, Lemon.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.876
Thanks to you,
the Rammer Jammer

06:15.976 --> 06:17.911
has become
a destination.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.413
You clearly
have a gift

06:19.513 --> 06:20.914
for the restaurant
business.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.049
(laughs)

06:22.149 --> 06:23.417
Thank you,
Edward.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.753
I realize that you
are otherwise committed,

06:25.853 --> 06:27.788
but I was wondering
if you might consider

06:27.888 --> 06:28.989
a new challenge.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.791
Well, what are
you talking about?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.126
It is time
I retire.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.429
And I can't think
of a single person

06:35.529 --> 06:37.030
I'd rather sell
Fancie's to.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.132
Oh...

06:39.232 --> 06:42.069
Wow, th...
that's so sweet.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.403
I'm-I'm honored.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.872
I mean, Fancie's is...

06:44.972 --> 06:46.440
well, I mean, it's
the best restaurant

06:46.540 --> 06:47.608
in the entire area.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.878
Uh, but... um...

06:50.978 --> 06:52.145
I'm happy here.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.747
You are not going
to believe this.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.148
She's missing
an earring.
What?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.416
She insists on wearing

06:57.317 --> 06:57.851
those cheap feather things
in her ears.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.086
When did you
have it last?

06:59.787 --> 07:00.921
I think I was dicing the slaw.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.490
Huh.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.526
Okay, no one eat the coleslaw.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.462
We'll get you more,
on the house.

07:08.562 --> 07:12.766
Um, all I ask is, uh,
you think about it.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.672
So when you told me
about coming down here

07:18.772 --> 07:20.608
and discovering the identity
of your real father,

07:20.708 --> 07:22.075
I just assumed
that you left out

07:22.175 --> 07:23.477
all the aunts and
uncles and stuff

07:23.577 --> 07:24.645
to keep
the story tight.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.747
No, I just... I met
the one Wilkes,
Aunt Maureen.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.582
She smelled like
mothballs, was spooky,

07:29.282 --> 07:29.750
and tried to make
me a Belle.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.585
And no one else ever
reached out to you?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.887
I may have
been invited

07:33.987 --> 07:34.955
to a few barbeques.

07:35.055 --> 07:35.789
You may have?

07:36.690 --> 07:37.991
Okay, they invited me
to a bunch of stuff.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.494
But I was busy
starting a practice,

07:40.594 --> 07:41.862
and I was... busy.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.498
You know? So eventually,
the Evites stopped.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.133
The Wilkes
are strangers.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.701
You don't talk
to strangers.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.003
Families are hard
and expensive.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.039
As proven by
my therapy bills.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.541
We don't need
a house that bad.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.509
Mm. Maybe you feel

07:55.609 --> 07:56.677
if you reach out
to this family,

07:56.777 --> 07:58.011
they will hurt you,
like your dad.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.747
The doctor.
The undead one.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.882
I'm not scared.
I'm smart.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.784
Yes, but what if
the Wilkes are amazing?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.753
What if they're
warm and fun?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.487
You know, people
to have holidays with

08:07.588 --> 08:08.689
and Sunday
barbeques.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.990
What if they're
cold and boring?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.760
And they shoot what they're
gonna eat for Sunday barbeques,

08:12.860 --> 08:14.762
and one Sunday,
that could be us.

08:14.862 --> 08:15.996
Think I'll take
my chances.
Great.

08:17.097 --> 08:17.598
Be my guest.
Just leave me out of it.
Come on, Zoe.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.232
Look, one phone call.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.135
No! I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.704
Okay? As a matter of fact,
let's just eat

08:23.804 --> 08:24.972
the rest of our lunch
in silence.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.875
Okay.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.544
Is that an...

08:30.644 --> 08:32.613
earring in your
coleslaw?

08:38.184 --> 08:40.821
(car horn honks)

08:40.921 --> 08:42.923
(seagulls calling)

08:43.023 --> 08:44.958
(birds singing)

08:55.803 --> 08:56.604
Hey.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.305
Is it true that Theresa quit?

08:58.405 --> 09:00.207
Yeah.
Why?
We just hired her.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.675
Well, we shouldn't have.

09:02.843 --> 09:03.310
She's crazy. I mean, she flipped
out on me this morning.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.277
This morning?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.946
(sniffs)

09:06.046 --> 09:06.947
Wade.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.148
You slept with her?

09:08.248 --> 09:09.683
Ow!
Why can you
not separate

09:09.783 --> 09:10.984
your business
from your pleasure?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.219
Calm down,
all right?

09:12.319 --> 09:13.621
Business is booming,
and as it happens,

09:13.721 --> 09:14.922
so too is my pleasure.

09:16.089 --> 09:16.924
(scoffs)
You should be thanking me.
I did us a favor.

09:17.490 --> 09:17.925
Oh, a favor?
Mm-hmm.

09:18.425 --> 09:18.926
Really?
Yeah.

09:20.060 --> 09:20.694
The game is tomorrow, we have
a crowd of people coming,

09:21.294 --> 09:21.829
and no second
bartender.

09:22.262 --> 09:22.830
Good news is,

09:23.496 --> 09:24.197
this jingle's
going great.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.198
Let me...
Wade.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.834
This isn't funny,
okay?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.602
Things need to change
around here.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.004
There's just too much...
incompetence.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.340
Whoa. Who crawled up your
skirt and died, sister?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.308
(sighs)
Hey, guys,

09:35.408 --> 09:36.710
the health inspector
just called.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.311
Apparently, someone
told him about

09:38.411 --> 09:39.579
Shanette's
earring.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.848
And he might
make a pop-in

09:40.948 --> 09:42.315
next week, so I was
thinking maybe

09:42.415 --> 09:43.817
we should do
something about

09:43.917 --> 09:45.185
that weird smell
in the kitchen.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.689
Yeah. Does smell pretty bad.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.692
Ha!

09:53.794 --> 09:54.628
Fine.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.997
I will take
care of it.
All right.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.365
Cool.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.933
Okay.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.836
Twice in two days.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.605
Let me guess: you found
something else to return to me,

10:05.706 --> 10:06.874
so you followed
me in here.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.141
No, actually,
I'm just in here

10:08.241 --> 10:09.309
to pick up
my lunch, so...

10:09.409 --> 10:11.011
That old story.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.746
Hey, Wade.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.347
You seem to know how
to have a good time.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.650
Well, I do
try my best.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.652
I've got a tragically
empty social calendar

10:18.752 --> 10:20.287
and I'm looking
to fill it.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.354
Any ideas?

10:22.255 --> 10:23.356
Uh... you know how
to work a beer tap?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.358
Don't you just pull the lever,
fill the mug?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.359
Well, that's
the easy part.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.728
Tricky part is
doing that

10:28.762 --> 10:29.029
while fending off advances
from awkward dudes.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.032
I've had plenty
of practice.
(clears throat)

10:32.132 --> 10:33.667
All right, then.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.935
I'll see you
tomorrow.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.203
Will do, Wade.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.938
Here you go,
George.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.907
Oh, thank you.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.211
Kickoff's at 7:00,
George.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.312
I'm sure
I'll see you

10:45.412 --> 10:47.647
when your TV
magically breaks.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.853
(bell on door tinkles)

10:52.953 --> 10:54.788
Emergency!

10:54.888 --> 10:56.056
We have
an emergency here!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.859
Dr. Hart, listen:

10:58.959 --> 11:00.293
this one ran
the other one over.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.328
Patty, Prizzi,
what happened?

11:02.595 --> 11:03.396
I was just
backing up.
I stopped
to pick up her soda can.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.799
What kind of person
just litters like that?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.801
She bent down.
I didn't see here.

11:07.901 --> 11:08.802
BOTH:
She shouldn't have been...

11:08.902 --> 11:09.837
...driving!
...down there!

11:09.937 --> 11:10.938
She's compulsive.
She's blind.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.173
This just proves my point:
family is dangerous.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.442
These two are certifiable.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.444
What'd you just say
about my sister?

11:17.544 --> 11:18.946
I'm gonna smash
your face in.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.948
No one talks that way
about a Pritchett!

11:21.048 --> 11:23.683
Ladies, listen, I'm sure
she didn't mean anything.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.986
I wanna go to Brick.
I agree.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.054
(clears throat)

11:29.322 --> 11:30.724
It wasn't your fault.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.325
You were just looking
out the window.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.393
It wasn't your fault.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.329
You were just looking
out for my lawn.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.298
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

11:38.398 --> 11:40.700
BILL:
Isn't that sweet? Family.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.235
That's it? This one runs
the other one over

11:42.335 --> 11:43.236
and you just forgive each other?

11:44.271 --> 11:45.338
It's just like they say
in our favorite movie...

11:45.438 --> 11:46.840
Dolphin Tale.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.241
BOTH:
Family is forever.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.977
Dolphin Tale?

11:50.077 --> 11:50.811
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.717
AnnaBeth, you here?

11:58.852 --> 12:02.990
No, no, no,
this ain't happening!

12:03.090 --> 12:04.892
Lavon, what are you doing here?

12:04.992 --> 12:06.960
Well, I decided not
to go to Vegas

12:07.060 --> 12:08.195
because I had this
weird feeling.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.131
And now I know the weird
feeling's on account of

12:11.231 --> 12:12.933
a guy with giant feet!

12:13.033 --> 12:14.367
Who belongs to those shoes?

12:14.467 --> 12:15.368
Let me explain.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.736
MAN:
AnnaBeth?

12:19.272 --> 12:21.041
Lavon, you remember
my father.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.343
The size 14?

12:23.443 --> 12:24.978
(chuckles)

12:25.078 --> 12:28.215
Mayor Hayes.
Mr. Thibodaux.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.251
It turns out my parents
are visiting for the weekend.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.854
48-hour shore leave
from their retirement cruise.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.022
Fun!

12:36.189 --> 12:38.025
Sweetie, why does the mayor
have a key to your place?

12:38.125 --> 12:41.394
Is it one of those
"key to the city" keys?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.363
'Cause I thought
those were larger...

12:43.463 --> 12:44.397
and decorative.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.766
Uh, uh...

12:46.867 --> 12:49.036
Interesting question.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.506
We're dating!
Surprise!

12:53.606 --> 12:54.808
The two of you?

12:54.908 --> 12:57.444
You and Mayor Hayes,
you're-you're...

12:57.544 --> 12:58.411
you're dating?

12:58.511 --> 12:59.446
Yes, indeed.

12:59.546 --> 13:03.183
Well, excuse me.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.785
I've just got to call
your mother.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.259
Wha...? I can't believe

13:12.359 --> 13:13.927
your parents don't know
we're dating?!

13:14.027 --> 13:16.830
Is that why you wanted
me out of town?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.932
Lavon, I...

13:19.032 --> 13:19.833
Yes.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.468
Is this about
what I think it's about?

13:22.669 --> 13:25.805
Some people are just so set
in their ways in the South.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.440
We'd like to think
that we've changed, but...

13:27.540 --> 13:28.508
Football.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.878
We are not a post-rival
America!

13:30.978 --> 13:33.180
My family
is Auburn royalty.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.381
And you're 'Bama
through and through.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.549
Well, what were you gonna do,
keep the secret forever?

13:37.517 --> 13:38.919
I was waiting
for their cruise to be over

13:40.020 --> 13:41.454
before telling them.
I didn't want to take the chance

13:41.554 --> 13:43.356
that one of them would jump
overboard.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.557
Oh, don't hate me.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.228
Everything's gonna be
all right now.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.098
We'll just help them get
to know the real Lavon Hayes.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.366
Yeah. I'll make food
for everybody tomorrow.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.467
We'll bond over barbecue.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.835
That sounds brilliant!

13:55.936 --> 13:56.970
By brilliant,

13:57.070 --> 13:58.939
you mean we have
no other options?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.007
Yep.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.342
ZOE (voice breaking):
 This movie, Frank?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.577
It's incredible!

14:04.677 --> 14:06.947
It's about a dolphin
who loses its tail,

14:07.047 --> 14:08.882
so they build it
a new one,

14:08.982 --> 14:11.118
but it can't live
in the ocean anymore, Frank,

14:11.218 --> 14:13.186
so they have to put it
in an aquarium,

14:13.286 --> 14:16.890
and the struggle
to save Winter's life,

14:16.990 --> 14:20.193
it brings everyone together:
the mom and the kid

14:20.293 --> 14:22.129
and Harry Connick.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.332
Because family is forever,
Frank!

14:25.432 --> 14:27.034
Family is forever.

14:27.134 --> 14:30.170
It i a popular rental.

14:31.939 --> 14:35.142
Look, um, could I ask you
something?

14:35.242 --> 14:38.411
You need to ask me,
Frank the pharmacist, or me...

14:38.511 --> 14:41.548
Frank, Dixie Stop PI?

14:41.648 --> 14:47.020
Just out of curiosity, you know,
how hard would it be if, say

14:47.120 --> 14:49.589
I wanted to get in touch
with the Wilkes clan?

14:49.689 --> 14:52.025
Do they all live
near each other?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.961
Is there a patriarch
or a matriarch?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.028
Do they bowl?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.964
That's a softball.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.165
Everybody in the
Wilkes family's

14:59.166 --> 15:01.234
gonna be at a birthday party
in Lillian tomorrow.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.936
Tomorrow?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.373
I'm gonna need to renew this.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.253
(music playing on video)

15:20.353 --> 15:23.623
Oh, again?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.392
The dolphins? Really?

15:25.492 --> 15:28.661
I mean, did you get
any sleep?

15:28.761 --> 15:31.064
Joel, I figured it out.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.967
I want the barbecues
and the holidays.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.470
I want someone to forgive me
if I hit them with my car.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.340
Family is forever.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.308
(music stops)

15:42.075 --> 15:43.176
It's time to meet
the Wilkes.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.612
That's great!
I'm really proud of you.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.348
How you want to do this?
You want to, like, I don't know,

15:48.448 --> 15:50.483
invite one or two of 'em
over for dinner?

15:50.583 --> 15:51.484
No. We're going to Lillian

15:52.452 --> 15:53.220
to crash an eight-year-old's
birthday party.

15:53.886 --> 15:54.621
Gonna meet them all at once.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.490
Okay. I love it, I love it.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.093
We'll just... jump right in.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.229
We're gonna hurdle.
We'll be sweet and charming,

16:02.329 --> 16:04.631
and they'll all fall in love
with me at once, right?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.299
Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.501
Why wouldn't they?

16:08.601 --> 16:10.370
Maybe we should bring
a present.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.172
A humongous present.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.645
Hey, Lemon.
Is everything okay?

16:18.745 --> 16:21.181
George, um, great.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.516
Can I talk to you for a minute?

16:23.616 --> 16:25.052
In confidence?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.486
Attorney-client privilege?

16:26.586 --> 16:30.123
Yes, but technically,
I can't be your attorney

16:30.223 --> 16:31.324
unless I collect fees.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.728
(clears throat)
Attorney-client privilege it is.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.596
What's up?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.498
Edward offered
to sell me Fancie's.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.268
And you know how much
I love Fancie's.
I mean, ever since

16:41.368 --> 16:44.271
we were young, A.B. and I
used to play Fancie's.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.706
We would dress up
our stuffed animals,

16:46.806 --> 16:48.375
we would feed them
the finest cuisine.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.144
Fancie's does seem
a lot more up your alley,

16:51.244 --> 16:53.280
but aren't you and Wade doing
really well here?

16:53.380 --> 16:56.483
You guys are this
unlikely super team.
(chuckles)

16:56.583 --> 16:59.152
Are you sure you want to mess up
what's already working?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.755
You know what, you're right.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.790
I'm just,
I'm having a bad day.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.160
It'll go away.

17:07.260 --> 17:11.098
All right, well, you need
anything else, just call me.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.500
Thanks.
All right.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.604
Yeah, so, uh, we need to hire
a new fish delivery person,

17:17.704 --> 17:22.175
and maybe not one of the
female persuasion this time.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.078
All right, let me
grab this for you. Okay.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.316
(exhales sharply)

17:29.416 --> 17:30.317
(doorbell rings)

17:31.251 --> 17:31.618
Okay, it's just
a 120-year-long rivalry

17:32.752 --> 17:34.087
between the two of the
greatest football powerhouses

17:34.187 --> 17:35.288
in the South.
That's right.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.090
No reason we can't
put it to bed

17:37.190 --> 17:38.691
with a plate
of baby back ribs

17:38.791 --> 17:41.561
and our charming
dispositions.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.363
Mm!

17:44.464 --> 17:46.166
(both sigh)

17:47.834 --> 17:49.068
Go...

17:49.169 --> 17:50.069
'Bama!

17:50.170 --> 17:52.739
(parents laugh)

17:52.839 --> 17:56.309
Uh, Gerald, Dorrie,
um, am I dreaming,

17:56.409 --> 17:59.846
or are y'all wearing
my beloved Alabama jerseys?

17:59.946 --> 18:02.482
And... they got your number
on the back!

18:02.582 --> 18:04.083
I'll call Dr. Hart.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.586
They've obviously had
some sort of brain trauma.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.754
Oh, sweetheart!

18:07.854 --> 18:09.289
Isn't she delightfully
hilarious?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.624
We don't care about some
silly old football feud.

18:11.724 --> 18:12.825
We love Lavon Hayes!

18:12.925 --> 18:15.228
Oh!
You are family now!

18:15.328 --> 18:17.564
(chuckles)
Well, this is easier
than anticipated.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.565
(laughs)

18:19.566 --> 18:21.368
Hey, how about a tour
of the Mayor's mansion?

18:21.468 --> 18:22.835
Whoo!
Yeah.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.538
(both laugh)

18:25.638 --> 18:28.541
Mom, what is going on?!

18:28.641 --> 18:30.477
We're just trying to be
supportive of you, honey.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.381
We want this to work;
you dating the Lavon Hayes.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.283
We could be in-laws
to the mayor!

18:36.383 --> 18:39.452
In-laws?! He has not proposed!

18:39.552 --> 18:42.755
We know. Your father and I
called your sister last night.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.292
She filled us in
on your little love saga.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.394
Men just need a little nudge

18:47.494 --> 18:49.429
in the right direction
sometimes.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.797
No-no-no-no!

18:50.897 --> 18:52.299
There will be
no nudging.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.267
Trust us. We know
what we're doing.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.404
Now I want to see
this house.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.871
Uh... hey.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.174
(chattering)

19:05.812 --> 19:07.780
On second thought,
this is a big jump.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.915
Jumping without
forethought,

19:09.849 --> 19:10.817
that's how you break
your legs, your arms.

19:10.917 --> 19:11.918
I need my arms.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.754
Zoe, Zoe, no-no-no.
You can't back out now.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.489
We can do this.
We totally belong here.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.725
You know, we'll just
tell them who you are,

19:18.825 --> 19:21.194
that you came
to mend fences,

19:21.294 --> 19:22.862
and celebrate
the future generations.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.431
Yeah, that's gonna
work, right?

19:24.531 --> 19:25.398
Yeah, totally.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.633
Plus we brought
a great gift.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.202
That we left in the car.
I'll be right back.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.203
Wait, Joel, don't leave!

19:30.303 --> 19:31.204
Be right back, right back.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.573
Well, hello! I didn't
think you were coming!

19:33.673 --> 19:34.541
What?!

19:35.842 --> 19:38.211
You're-you're glad to see me?

19:38.311 --> 19:39.479
I'm thrilled!
The party planner said

19:40.613 --> 19:41.448
the entertainer's car
broke down, but here you are.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.350
You're the party
entertainment, right?

19:43.450 --> 19:45.585
Oh, no, no, I'm not.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.719
Oh. Then why are you here?

19:46.819 --> 19:49.856
I don't think
you're family.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.592
I'm not the entertainment...

19:52.692 --> 19:54.261
he is!

19:54.361 --> 19:59.299
This is the Great Joel-ini!

19:59.999 --> 20:01.301
He's a magician!

20:11.978 --> 20:13.580
A magician?
A magician?!

20:13.680 --> 20:15.915
I freaked out, okay?
It's actually a great idea.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.550
'Cause now we can
feel them out,

20:17.650 --> 20:19.218
see what kind
of family they are:

20:19.319 --> 20:20.487
are they crazy,
are they clingy?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.221
Yeah, that's great, except
there's one small problem:

20:22.722 --> 20:23.356
I'm not a magician!!

20:24.056 --> 20:24.557
I've seen you do card tricks.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.793
I know two
card tricks!

20:26.893 --> 20:27.760
They are entertaining,

20:28.728 --> 20:29.462
but that doesn't qualify me
as entertainment.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.931
You're the one who wanted me
to have a family.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.267
Let me win them over
with my winning personality.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.869
But before I do that I need
to get them really drunk.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.506
I...
Please?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.641
Well, this is not exactly
the way

20:41.741 --> 20:43.510
I would have gone about it,

20:43.610 --> 20:46.379
but dating you
is certainly never boring.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.448
I will go find
a deck of cards.

20:48.548 --> 20:49.782
(laughs)

20:49.882 --> 20:52.452
A magician who didn't come
with his own hat.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.787
Oh, yeah, well he just graduated
magician school.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.988
So this is his big break.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.590
It's quite a venue
for it, too.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.592
Everybody knows
that the journey
from the six-year-old

21:01.027 --> 21:02.729
party circuit to the cover of
 Magician's Monthly is short.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.997
Right.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.299
So you are a Wilkes?

21:06.399 --> 21:08.401
Vivian Wilkes,
birthday boy's mom.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.469
Oh, wow. Congratulations.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.404
It seems like you have
a very large family.

21:11.504 --> 21:14.273
Oh, yes. The Wilkes come out
in droves for birthdays,

21:14.374 --> 21:15.508
holidays, funerals.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.410
We're kind of loyal like that.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.278
Much like a herd
of elephants.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.647
Sounds a little
oppressive.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.316
Oh, it can be.
But, you know, family.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.418
I don't know how I'd get
by without knowing

21:25.518 --> 21:27.787
that they will be here
for me no matter what.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.422
I get that.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.024
Have you seen Dolphin Tale?

21:32.124 --> 21:35.294
This must be
the birthday boy?

21:35.395 --> 21:37.830
Yep. Somebody is eight today.

21:37.930 --> 21:38.831
Wow...

21:38.931 --> 21:39.832
Say hello, Harley.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.902
Pleased to meet you.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.738
Pleased to meet you.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.841
Oh!

21:48.941 --> 21:50.977
He is so cute.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.379
Thank you.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.718
Yeah!
And to think
we were worried

21:58.818 --> 22:01.454
everyone wasn't
gonna get along.
How awesome is this?

22:01.554 --> 22:02.722
So...

22:02.822 --> 22:03.856
so awesome.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.925
This barbecue sauce is amazing.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.794
You must be a wizard
in the kitchen.

22:07.894 --> 22:08.861
A wizard!

22:08.961 --> 22:10.363
Oh, he is.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.898
A regular Harry Potter.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.032
Of the kitchen.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.333
You know,
our little BananaBeth

22:14.434 --> 22:16.736
is a culinary genius herself.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.004
BananaBeth?

22:18.104 --> 22:18.971
Of-of course.

22:19.071 --> 22:22.875
I have the happiest
taste buds in BlueBell.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.010
You know, Lavon,
I can tell you

22:24.110 --> 22:26.579
from experience
that a wife's cooking

22:26.679 --> 22:28.347
is one of the main ingredients

22:28.448 --> 22:30.983
in the recipe
that is a long and loving...

22:31.083 --> 22:32.051
(AnnaBeth whoops)

22:32.151 --> 22:34.086
Look at the time.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.756
Y'all have to hit the
open waters tomorrow.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.458
Probably should rest up

22:38.558 --> 22:40.793
before you get back on the ship.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.863
Well, hell, it's not like
we're rowing the damn thing.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.998
(laughing)
Oh, no.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.500
Matter of fact, isn't there
a 'Bama game on right now?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.101
Well, I'm-I'm recording it
for later.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.504
Let's turn it on, son.
Roll Tide!

22:51.604 --> 22:52.605
(whoops)

22:52.705 --> 22:55.642
LAVON:
All right. After you.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.744
(sighs)

22:57.844 --> 22:59.946
All right, Harley, what do you
think happened to your card?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.047
Wait, is it under your shoe?

23:01.147 --> 23:02.381
Let's see is it
under your shoe?

23:02.482 --> 23:03.550
No, no, I mean...

23:03.650 --> 23:04.884
Is it under your
armpit there?

23:04.984 --> 23:05.752
Let me see. Other armpit.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.420
Let me see, let me see.
Oh, gosh.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.421
I guess it must be gone.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.756
Unless it's, uh...

23:09.856 --> 23:11.090
behind your ear.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.024
Whoa!

23:12.124 --> 23:13.660
(kids clapping)

23:13.760 --> 23:15.795
And that is Christie over there.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.763
She is a hoot.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.431
She hate-reads
a new romance novel every day,

23:19.165 --> 23:19.866
and then she just
won't shut up

23:20.567 --> 23:21.033
about how awful the writing is.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.134
Oh, and this is Brando.

23:22.702 --> 23:23.536
Ooh.
He's my grandpa.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.505
My real name is Vernon.

23:25.605 --> 23:26.539
They call me Brando

23:26.639 --> 23:27.540
because of my incredible

23:27.640 --> 23:29.942
Marlon Brando impersonation.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.879
(imitating Marlon Brando):
I'm gonna make him an offer

23:32.979 --> 23:34.581
he can't refuse.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.950
Stella!

23:38.050 --> 23:39.118
I know.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.120
It's uncanny.
Oh.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.756
That was...
Terrible!

23:43.856 --> 23:45.558
Sometimes he recites
the whole script

23:45.658 --> 23:46.693
for Don Juan DeMarco.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.628
His Johnny Depp impression
actually sounds

23:49.361 --> 23:50.597
more like Brando
than his Brando.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.531
Hey.

23:52.331 --> 23:52.832
Oh, and this is
my sister, Winnie.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.433
I'm sorry,
I don't know your name.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.668
Oh, it's...

23:55.768 --> 23:56.569
Chloe.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.538
Nice to meet you.
So glad you guys arrived.

23:59.338 --> 23:59.806
The kids were
getting restless.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.140
And my cousin Bobby's
boyfriend offered

24:01.708 --> 24:02.441
to do balloon animals.

24:03.175 --> 24:03.710
But he could only
make snakes.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.778
So it's a good thing
you guys came when you did.

24:05.878 --> 24:06.846
Do you perform, too?

24:06.946 --> 24:07.847
Oh, no, I'm here more

24:07.947 --> 24:09.716
in the advisory capacity.

24:09.816 --> 24:10.249
Hi, hi.

24:10.349 --> 24:11.584
Hi.
Hi.
Hey.

24:12.552 --> 24:13.586
Okay. So, I've done
the two card tricks I know

24:14.386 --> 24:14.821
in as many permutations
as possible.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.956
But if I do them again,
the kids might mutiny.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.991
We need some new ideas.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.860
Okay, I got you covered.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.094
Thank you.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.095
Hey, Vivian?

24:23.195 --> 24:24.964
Do you have any shaving cream?

24:27.066 --> 24:30.803
The chicken paillard is one
of my favorite dishes as well.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.038
Ah, it was superb.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.206
I mean, this place, it's superb.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.775
It always has been.

24:35.875 --> 24:39.145
No, uh, earrings
in the coleslaw.

24:39.245 --> 24:42.014
No one's sleeping
with the help.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.550
No fires in the kitchen.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.756
Edward, I belong here.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.624
I would like to buy Fancie's.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.159
I am very, very happy
to hear that.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.861
But after you said no earlier,

24:54.961 --> 24:56.763
I was approached
by another buyer.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.632
I regret having
to press, but...

24:59.732 --> 25:01.634
I need your offer by tonight.

25:01.734 --> 25:02.902
Tonight?

25:04.170 --> 25:07.273
Okay, well, then, tonight it is.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.141
I will do my best.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.077
Wonderful.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.016
TV ANNOUNCER:
Alabama goes up-tempo.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.251
Eddy Lacy with the carry.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.520
Man, that is one sweet
hurry-up offense

25:21.621 --> 25:23.122
your guys are
running there.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.123
You know,

25:24.223 --> 25:25.892
when you set
aside the rivalry,

25:25.992 --> 25:28.060
you can really
appreciate
the artistry.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.996
My head might literally explode.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.698
Oh, you will never guess

25:31.798 --> 25:33.299
who I heard from last week.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.267
Jake's mother.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.103
LAVON: Jake?

25:37.203 --> 25:38.571
As in A.B.'s
ex-husband, Jake?

25:38.671 --> 25:40.139
No, no, no,
do not take the bait.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.140
Yes, and get this.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.809
Apparently Jakey's
been asking

25:42.909 --> 25:45.812
about A.B., says that he
is sorry for what happened.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.080
Says that he is
a changed man.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.949
Well, if there's anything
I learned from being mayor,

25:50.049 --> 25:53.119
it's that saying and doing
are two different things.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.220
So true.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.088
The words of a man
of action.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.289
Hmm, speaking of action.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.325
Let's watch
some Alabama football

25:59.425 --> 26:02.161
since we all love
the Crimson Tide.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.630
I think all your
mother's saying

26:03.730 --> 26:06.565
is that AnnaBeth is
in high demand.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.601
Oh, for the love of God.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.036
Oh, my God,
did you see that call?

26:10.136 --> 26:12.739
The refs are totally
in the Tide's pocket.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.073
It's just like
you always say, Daddy.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.575
Alabama pays off the refs.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.110
Just like
in the 2009 Iron Bowl.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.679
Hold on, now.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.247
Now, I-I do not say that.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.215
I'm totally over

26:23.315 --> 26:24.884
that crushing,
corrupt, criminal...

26:24.984 --> 26:25.985
Now, Gerald.

26:26.886 --> 26:27.854
You just watch
your blood pressure, honey.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.989
This is getting
way too heated for me.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.724
I insist that we watch

26:31.824 --> 26:33.760
the rest of the game
in absolute silence.

26:36.162 --> 26:39.165
Pushed... short.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.105
We used to do this
at the children's ward

26:46.205 --> 26:47.874
in the hospital.
(clears throat)

26:47.974 --> 26:49.108
Where I used to volunteer at.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.342
Oh, my gosh, so...

26:50.442 --> 26:52.278
you're a good person.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.680
Whoa, we need a good
person around here.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.782
We're just a
bunch of boozing,

26:55.882 --> 26:57.083
TV-watching, heathens.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.085
Oh, believe me, so are we.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, very much so.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.319
This is so fun!

27:00.419 --> 27:02.922
Thanks!
Yeah, sure.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.090
Oh, God save us--
Ned's brought out

27:04.190 --> 27:06.158
the karaoke machine.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.027
MAN:
* At the county fair...

27:11.297 --> 27:14.166
* Threw out my shoulder
but I won her *

27:14.266 --> 27:17.837
* That teddy bear

27:17.937 --> 27:20.139
* She got me saying sugar pie

27:20.239 --> 27:22.641
* Honey, darling and dear

27:22.742 --> 27:24.811
* I ain't seen the Braves play

27:24.911 --> 27:26.345
* A game all year...

27:26.445 --> 27:27.646
Oh, no.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.315
You two are not getting
away with this one.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.683
When at a Wilkes party.

27:31.383 --> 27:31.984
When at a Wilkes party.
Oh...

27:32.484 --> 27:33.686
Oh, w-wait a minute.

27:33.786 --> 27:34.921
Oh, no, we're dancing.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.256
* I love it,
I want some more of it... *

27:37.356 --> 27:39.692
Oh, hey!

27:39.792 --> 27:40.860
I know you.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.328
Ah, yeah.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.863
I'm a big fan of yours.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.766
Oh, my gosh, this is amazing.

27:46.866 --> 27:47.934
They are amazing.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.201
I love them,
and they love me.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.136
Well, that's great.

27:51.003 --> 27:51.303
I mean, they're great
and you're great.

27:52.038 --> 27:52.805
It makes perfect sense.
Yeah.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.073
I'm gonna tell them who I am.

27:54.573 --> 27:55.207
Perfect, you should.

27:55.808 --> 27:56.675
Right after this dance.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.812
* But I like it, I love it

27:59.912 --> 28:01.914
* I want some more of it.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.724
(all cheering)

28:11.824 --> 28:13.826
TV ANNOUNCER:
Touchdown!

28:19.365 --> 28:21.033
Thank you, George Tucker.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.769
You just earned
me ten bucks.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.070
Uh, how is that?

28:24.170 --> 28:24.636
I bet Big Sam here

28:24.737 --> 28:26.205
you'd randomly stop by

28:26.305 --> 28:27.206
before halftime.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.107
That was five bucks.

28:28.941 --> 28:29.441
I got the extra five
when you started

28:30.142 --> 28:31.110
to stare all moony-eyed at me.

28:32.378 --> 28:32.979
Uh, well you might want to hold
on to your money there, Big Sam.

28:33.846 --> 28:34.947
'Cause I'm just here
to enjoy the game.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.382
Mingle with some fellow fans.

28:36.482 --> 28:37.917
And these eyes...

28:38.017 --> 28:38.751
not moony.

28:38.851 --> 28:39.718
Is that so?

28:39.819 --> 28:41.754
Trust me.

28:41.854 --> 28:42.488
Hey, there.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.223
Uh, I'm sorry, have we met?

28:44.323 --> 28:45.224
I'm George.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.158
I know who you are.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.727
Excuse me...
Well, how-how is that fair...

28:48.828 --> 28:50.196
exactly? I mean...

28:50.296 --> 28:51.297
you know who I am

28:51.397 --> 28:52.498
and I know nothing
about you.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.833
I-I say we go somewhere

28:54.801 --> 28:56.168
and-and remedy that
injustice immediately.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.970
How about you?

28:58.070 --> 28:58.905
Sure.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.743
I like that, I like that.
Okay, but just...

29:04.844 --> 29:05.744
Oh, hey, Lemon!

29:06.545 --> 29:07.880
I think Tom and I
struck pay dirt.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.481
All right, ready and go!

29:09.581 --> 29:11.851
* Are you hungry
or just thirsty *

29:11.951 --> 29:14.020
* Or just looking for some fun

29:14.120 --> 29:15.387
* Come to the Rammer Jammer

29:15.487 --> 29:19.058
* Alabama's number one.

29:19.158 --> 29:19.892
* Rammer...

29:20.526 --> 29:21.027
No, it's * Rammer...

29:21.760 --> 29:22.761
Wade, uh,
* Ram... Ram...

29:23.662 --> 29:24.396
can I speak to you
for a moment please?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.098
In private.

29:26.198 --> 29:26.933
Yeah.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.101
It's * Rammer Jammer...

29:29.201 --> 29:30.937
If you don't like it,
I have other ideas.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.438
I just need to come up
with something

29:32.538 --> 29:33.806
that rhymes
with chicken fried steak.

29:33.906 --> 29:34.706
I have an idea.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.076
What if instead of
buying a radio ad,

29:37.176 --> 29:39.111
we use the surplus
money to expand?

29:39.211 --> 29:42.448
To build a-a better,
higher-end Rammer Jammer,

29:42.548 --> 29:43.315
say, at Fancie's?

29:43.415 --> 29:44.783
I mean, we could
even keep the name.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.452
What are you talking about?

29:46.552 --> 29:48.921
I spoke to Edward,
and he is selling.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.257
And he's willing to let us
in on the ground floor

29:51.357 --> 29:52.524
if we make an offer tonight.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.393
What? No.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.461
I hate Fancie's.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.063
I hate the name.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.031
I hate all
that pretentious food.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.833
I like the simple things,
all right?

30:00.933 --> 30:02.534
I like foods you can pronounce
in one syllable.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.171
Eggs, grits, uh, slaw.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.439
And the Rammer Jammer is the
only place I ever wanted to run.

30:07.539 --> 30:10.209
Owning a joint like this
has been my dream since forever.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.978
But it hasn't been mine.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.412
And I...

30:13.512 --> 30:16.382
I think that I need a change.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.984
Wh-What are you saying?

30:18.084 --> 30:21.420
Wade, working
with you has been amazing.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.190
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are...?

30:24.290 --> 30:26.092
Are you giving me
a compliment sandwich?

30:26.192 --> 30:27.293
I invented

30:27.393 --> 30:28.260
the compliment sandwich, lady.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.962
What? I just wanted to...

30:30.062 --> 30:31.530
Tell me that you want
to buy Fancie's.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.565
All right, go ahead, buy it.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.234
But you're doing it
on your own.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.870
I'm gonna take that surplus
cash, I'm gonna buy you out.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.273
Thanks.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.510
Well, good luck, Lemon.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.513
And, you know,
not that you will,

30:47.613 --> 30:50.182
but if you need a jingle,

30:50.282 --> 30:53.219
I can help you come up
with some rhymes for Fancie's.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.288
It's not gonna be easy though.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.492
* Rammer Jammer, Ram...

31:00.592 --> 31:02.328
Jingle's off, Tom.

31:02.428 --> 31:03.495
Aw, man!

31:03.595 --> 31:06.098
(crowd cheering)

31:08.600 --> 31:10.903
Well, that one's
Most Promising Freshman.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.272
Well, you certainly
lived up to that promise,

31:13.372 --> 31:15.274
Mr. Big Fancy Mayor.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.143
Can't even run
to the little girls' room

31:17.243 --> 31:19.611
without you two
hijacking my boyfriend.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.879
What'd I miss?

31:20.980 --> 31:21.948
Please say nothing.

31:22.814 --> 31:23.249
I was just telling
your parents that, uh,

31:24.350 --> 31:25.651
despite all these trophies,
being mayor of BlueBell

31:25.751 --> 31:27.153
is the highlight of my career.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.320
As it should be.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.321
Now, tell me something, uh,

31:29.421 --> 31:30.589
Mr. Mayor.
Yeah.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.424
Do you ever worry
about your electability

31:32.524 --> 31:33.592
as a single man?

31:33.692 --> 31:35.327
No, he doesn't.
Uh, do I what now?

31:35.427 --> 31:36.562
Well, it's a known fact

31:36.662 --> 31:38.030
that approval ratings rise

31:38.130 --> 31:40.132
for politicians with wives.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.001
And yet Lavon keeps
getting elected,

31:42.101 --> 31:43.902
so he must be
doing something right.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.038
Well, mayor's one thing, but...

31:46.138 --> 31:48.440
tell me you don't have
your eyes on the bigger prize.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.976
Congressman Hayes.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.010
Governor Hayes.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.578
Oh, I can just see you now

31:52.678 --> 31:54.046
with AnnaBeth on your arm,

31:54.146 --> 31:56.048
settling into the
Governor's mansion.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.917
Oh, I think we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.086
On everything.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.421
GERALD: Listen, we have
contacts in Montgomery

32:03.422 --> 32:04.190
I am itching to use--
it's the sort of thing

32:04.991 --> 32:05.357
you do for family.
That's right.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.160
Oh, for the love of all
that is holy, you have to stop.

32:11.130 --> 32:14.066
First of all, I said no nudging.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.468
Second of all
that is not a nudge.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.071
You're running him down with
a Mack truck with the words

32:19.171 --> 32:21.940
"Marry AnnaBeth"
on the side!

32:22.041 --> 32:22.941
I am an adult.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.111
Lavon is an adult.

32:25.211 --> 32:28.314
And we will make decisions
in our own time.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.356
So...

32:37.456 --> 32:39.091
second half?

32:40.492 --> 32:41.360
Well...

32:43.029 --> 32:44.530
I think we're gonna pass.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.432
We're getting a little tired.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.367
We'll show ourselves out.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.608
I apologize.

32:56.708 --> 32:57.609
(door opens)

32:57.709 --> 32:59.645
What?
(door closes)

32:59.745 --> 33:02.114
You got nothing
to apologize for.

33:02.214 --> 33:05.317
That's what parents do.
They-they can't understand

33:05.417 --> 33:09.188
that two people can be happy
just the way they are.

33:09.288 --> 33:12.391
We're in no hurry
to-to move to the next step.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.602
A.B.?

33:23.702 --> 33:25.371
(footsteps depart)

33:28.674 --> 33:30.776
Hey, fun party.

33:30.876 --> 33:31.777
Oh, thank you.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.612
It was so nice
to meet you.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.613
You're-you're great.

33:34.713 --> 33:35.747
Oh, you are, too.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.150
I just, I feel like we have
so much in common.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.685
I know. It's true.
Yeah.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.120
And there's a
reason for that.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.221
A great reason.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.589
I'm sorry.
What's happening here?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.291
Are you hitting on me?

33:45.391 --> 33:48.660
No. The reason that
we're so much alike...

33:48.760 --> 33:49.795
is because we're cousins!

33:49.895 --> 33:51.563
I'm Zoe Hart.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.234
Harley's daughter.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.270
Yeah! I recently moved
back to Alabama with Joel,

33:58.370 --> 34:00.572
and we've been talking about
the future and family,

34:00.672 --> 34:02.308
and I just thought
it was time.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.344
And you thought the best way
to do that was to come here

34:05.444 --> 34:08.114
and pretend to be
a magician's manager?

34:08.214 --> 34:10.549
Look, I-I was scared.

34:10.649 --> 34:14.052
I-I should have told you who
I was when I first got here.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.321
So I'm sorry.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.455
Don't apologize.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.190
In fact,
you probably had

34:18.290 --> 34:20.192
the right idea
to hide your identity.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.360
I'm fairly certain

34:22.428 --> 34:23.395
that nobody here would
appreciate your presence.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.464
Excuse me?

34:25.563 --> 34:27.733
Just because you happen
to be in the bloodline

34:27.833 --> 34:29.067
doesn't mean you belong.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.603
The way it works
with family, Miss Hart,

34:31.703 --> 34:33.672
is you get out
what you put in.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.141
And you've put in nothing.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.409
To us, you're nothing
but the entertainment.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.283
Hey, how'd it go?

34:44.382 --> 34:46.318
I don't want
to talk about it.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.631
Hey, uh, Wade,
have you seen Lynly?

34:59.731 --> 35:02.534
Oh, yeah, she stepped out
on break out with some guy.

35:02.634 --> 35:03.535
Big Sam?

35:03.635 --> 35:05.537
He wa pretty big.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.483
Hey, there.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.118
Can I get you a glass
of wine or something?

35:20.219 --> 35:21.420
Uh, you know
you're gonna have

35:21.520 --> 35:23.389
to start paying
for it now.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.256
(chuckles)

35:25.090 --> 35:28.260
As it turns out,
my offer was too low.

35:28.360 --> 35:32.331
Edward has accepted
another buyer.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.433
Any chance you'd take me back?

35:34.533 --> 35:37.135
(sighs)
Lemon...

35:37.236 --> 35:39.405
look, it's been a ride,

35:39.505 --> 35:42.674
and I've loved almost
every minute of it.

35:42.774 --> 35:46.878
But you and me, we want
different things in the world.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.847
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.149
Still, I'd take you
back in a second

35:51.250 --> 35:53.285
if you could tell me
that this place,

35:53.385 --> 35:55.821
with its fish guts
and the missing earrings

35:55.921 --> 36:00.892
and my particular proclivities
was gonna be enough for you.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.295
But I don't suspect
that's the case, is it?

36:03.395 --> 36:05.264
(sighs)

36:05.364 --> 36:07.833
I'm so confused, Wade.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.568
It's like I don't know

36:09.668 --> 36:11.903
where I belong
in the world anymore.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.307
I mean... I love it here,

36:15.407 --> 36:16.442
but I don't belong.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.577
I still feel like
I'm just visiting.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.446
Like I'm in limbo.

36:22.348 --> 36:26.585
Maybe somewhere between Fancie's
and the Rammer Jammer

36:26.685 --> 36:28.787
I will find my home.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.256
You keep looking.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.957
You'll find a place
that makes you happy.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.259
I know it.

36:34.159 --> 36:35.327
I've never been more sure
of anything.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.264
Thank you.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.566
You are a good friend.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.934
Probably the best one
that I've got.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.102
Right back at you, lady.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.473
And you know, don't worry
about the wine, all right?

36:47.573 --> 36:49.408
You'll always drink
for free here.

36:49.508 --> 36:50.942
Especially 'cause
nobody likes

36:51.042 --> 36:54.346
this crap you got
from Napa anyway.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.248
(laughs)

36:58.950 --> 37:00.952
(grunts) Lynly?

37:01.052 --> 37:03.355
Wow, that took you,
like, ten whole minutes.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.390
Lynly, what's going on?

37:05.291 --> 37:05.757
I thought you were
out here with, uh...

37:06.358 --> 37:07.293
Big Sam?
I told Wade that

37:08.059 --> 37:08.894
to see if you'd get
all jealous...

37:08.994 --> 37:10.796
and to win
five more dollars.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.498
Yeah, knew that. I knew that.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.532
No, you didn't.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.901
George, you say you want me
to stay away from you.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.736
So why can't you stay
away from me?

37:17.836 --> 37:18.770
Oh, right now?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.906
Uh, because I was worried
that you might be...

37:21.006 --> 37:23.008
What? Be having
a good time?

37:23.108 --> 37:24.776
Need someone
to look after me?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.378
You are acting
like my boyfriend,

37:26.478 --> 37:27.846
but without any
of the benefits.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.281
Lynly, I don't...

37:29.381 --> 37:31.617
George, look me
in the eye

37:31.717 --> 37:33.652
and tell me
you don't want to kiss me.

37:37.423 --> 37:40.258
That has never been
the issue here.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.528
Then what
are you waiting for?

37:45.797 --> 37:48.266
No. See? This is
a bad idea.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.568
There are worse ones
out there.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.537
Okay, well, I don't want
you to get hurt.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.972
And I do not want to
get hurt again myself.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.841
I'll be your Band-Aid
if you'll be mine.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.815
Bet you feel better already.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.290
*

38:16.595 --> 38:19.731
This isn't really about
your parents, is it?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.004
Halloween night,

38:26.104 --> 38:30.476
you said you had something
special planned?

38:30.576 --> 38:34.312
I might have jumped
to a premature conclusion.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.882
You thought I was
gonna propose?

38:41.387 --> 38:43.622
In retrospect,
I sort of get that.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.323
And since then,

38:45.424 --> 38:47.626
it's like a switch
flipped on in my brain,

38:47.726 --> 38:51.329
and I haven't stopped thinking
about where we stand.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.866
It's not fair to you, I know,
but I feel like I wasted

38:54.966 --> 38:58.069
a lot of time on Jake,

38:58.169 --> 39:00.606
and I don't want
to waste any more.

39:01.773 --> 39:02.841
But I love you.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.746
And things have
been going great...

39:07.846 --> 39:09.047
haven't they?

39:09.147 --> 39:12.083
Yes, of course.

39:12.183 --> 39:16.354
They've been so great...

39:16.455 --> 39:18.356
but I'm ready for more.

39:18.457 --> 39:21.827
I don't need to know
where we're heading.

39:21.927 --> 39:26.532
I just need to know
we're on the same path.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.099
And this isn't an ultimatum,

39:28.199 --> 39:32.971
but what I need to know is...

39:33.071 --> 39:37.776
if or when there comes a time

39:37.876 --> 39:40.145
that you aren't on that path
with me,

39:40.245 --> 39:41.780
you need to tell me.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.482
Okay?

39:50.922 --> 39:53.525
And I love you, too,

39:53.625 --> 39:56.161
but...

39:56.261 --> 39:58.897
I think I'm gonna stay
at my place tonight.

40:10.676 --> 40:13.545
Hey. Okay,
so I just watched,

40:13.645 --> 40:15.681
like, a dozen card
trick videos online.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.716
I am this close
to going pro.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.654
Listen.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.056
Hey. I'm sorry
that I pressured you

40:25.156 --> 40:27.092
into reaching out
to your family.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.427
I just, I want you
to be happy.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.497
It's not your fault.

40:31.597 --> 40:32.698
It's totally mine.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.534
I just didn't realize
how much I wanted it.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.669
But seeing how
they loved each other,

40:37.769 --> 40:40.171
it just hurts knowing that
I can't be a part of it.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.807
Well, you don't know
what the future holds.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.475
You know, maybe the Wilkes
will come around.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.910
Probably with pitchforks.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.978
(both chuckle)

40:47.078 --> 40:48.980
Maybe. I kind of hope so.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.717
Well, until then, you'll
just have to contend with me

40:51.817 --> 40:53.084
and my big
overbearing family.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.586
Yeah.
Or actually,

40:54.686 --> 40:56.454
as a matter of fact,
I was thinking

40:56.555 --> 40:57.923
of inviting Grandma Sylvie
down here for Hanukkah.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.825
She would love BlueBell.
Wow, Grandma Sylvie?

40:59.925 --> 41:01.727
Yeah, yeah.
And maybe we can invite

41:01.827 --> 41:03.194
your mom and
your dad, too!

41:03.294 --> 41:05.463
What?! No.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.665
I'm kidding!
I'm just kidding
Oh, my God.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.667
(laughs)
...about your parents,
but not about Sylvie.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.602
Grandma Sylvie's
definitely coming.

41:10.702 --> 41:11.703
Hmm.
Hey, now,

41:11.803 --> 41:14.640
um, I'll have you know
that I convinced Dash to buy

41:14.740 --> 41:17.543
(whispers):
"Do Not Disturb" signs
to hang on the door.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.978
Now that is your best trick yet.
Mm...

41:20.078 --> 41:22.881
(both chuckle)

41:22.981 --> 41:24.015
Oh, excuse me.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.751
(Zoe gasps)

41:25.851 --> 41:26.852
I brought y'all
a couple of signs.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.087
You could pick
which ones you want.
Thank you, Dash.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.221
I really appreciate that.
Certainly.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.623
We just, uh,
we're gonna...

41:31.723 --> 41:32.924
I'll just leave 'em
right here, okay?

41:33.024 --> 41:33.892
Yeah, that would
be great.

41:34.826 --> 41:35.527
Anything else I can do
for you lovebirds?

41:36.327 --> 41:37.228
No, no, that's fine.
You just have...

41:37.328 --> 41:38.630
All right, then.
See you later.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.732
Thank you very much.

41:42.300 --> 41:45.637
Ta-da! I made him disappear.

41:45.737 --> 41:49.240
You know,
I know some magic, too.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.043
Why don't you come here
so I can show you?

41:52.143 --> 41:52.978
Yeah.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.714
(both chuckle)

41:55.814 --> 41:57.515
Thank you.
