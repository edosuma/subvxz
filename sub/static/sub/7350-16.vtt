00:19.187 --> 00:21.555
*

00:40.541 --> 00:42.410
No, no, wait!

00:54.422 --> 00:57.191
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:57.225 --> 00:59.627
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:59.660 --> 01:02.196
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:02.230 --> 01:03.464
* How, how, how, how

01:03.497 --> 01:05.833
* Hey, hey

01:11.605 --> 01:13.274
* You gotta come on.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.781
What's up, baby brother?

01:20.814 --> 01:23.317
Hey, roomie.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.119
What the hell you doing?

01:25.153 --> 01:28.589
You got chips and dings
all in your paint.

01:28.622 --> 01:32.493
Or should I say,
you h chips and dings?

01:32.526 --> 01:35.629
Well, since...
when do you paint?

01:35.663 --> 01:38.632
Gave myself
a crash course in...

01:38.666 --> 01:41.669
flat enamels
and satin finishes.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.305
Oh, I also attacked the water
pressure in your shower.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.773
Went from a trickle
to a downpour.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.208
You got to try it.

01:47.241 --> 01:51.312
I will do after my run.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.486
What you think?

01:58.519 --> 02:01.722
Where the heck's my shoes?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.191
Right over here.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.425
Got 'em lined up.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.929
You've been busy.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.264
Well, got up early.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.535
Early as in early early,

02:14.568 --> 02:17.137
or you didn't
sleep all night?

02:18.406 --> 02:20.574
It's not what you're thinking.

02:20.608 --> 02:23.344
Oh, yeah,
what am I thinking?

02:23.377 --> 02:24.912
"Here comes the bipolar."

02:24.945 --> 02:28.882
Well, it is a little manic.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.951
Look, Chris, I can't pay
you rent or anything,

02:30.984 --> 02:34.388
so... this is my way
of giving back.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.957
Did you call that psychiatrist?

02:36.990 --> 02:41.762
Plan was,
I'd start with group therapy...

02:41.795 --> 02:43.364
and then call the headshrinker

02:43.397 --> 02:45.233
if I felt
like I really needed to.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.735
Well, when you need to,
it's usually too late.

02:47.768 --> 02:48.736
All right?

02:48.769 --> 02:49.937
You don't sleep all night,

02:49.970 --> 02:52.440
and then you go manic
and then run.

02:52.473 --> 02:56.477
And... I kind of like
having you around.

02:58.379 --> 03:02.816
Chris... there's a difference
between manic and happy.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.653
All right, this is happy.

03:05.686 --> 03:10.524
I'm taking my meds, staying
away from my triggers.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.961
All right, no booze,
no late nights.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.364
Even laying off
the ladies a bit.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.966
Hey, you don't
believe me,

03:18.999 --> 03:20.534
come by group therapy.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.535
You'll see.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.840
Dead body.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.842
Got to go.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.911
Well, you just go
enjoy your body

03:30.944 --> 03:32.980
and know that when you get back,
there will be

03:33.013 --> 03:34.882
a kick-ass shower
waiting for you.

03:34.915 --> 03:38.319
You the man, Cade, you the man.

03:38.352 --> 03:42.456
Yeah, I know, I know.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.427
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

03:46.460 --> 03:48.829
LASALLE:
What do we got?

03:48.862 --> 03:50.898
Petty Officer Maggie Barringer.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.835
Works as a Navy recruiter
in that building.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.038
Three tours in Iraq,
Purple Heart.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.908
No witnesses, no cameras
and no attendant.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.843
Loretta.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.646
Only time I've seen a body
this broken

04:05.679 --> 04:09.283
was when a skydiver's chute
didn't open.

04:09.317 --> 04:13.020
All injuries suggest
vehicular trauma.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.522
And after the impact,

04:14.555 --> 04:16.890
driver takes off and
hits that parked car.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.461
Glass over there
from the offending driver's

04:20.494 --> 04:22.363
broken headlight.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.499
Assuming the vehicle
was headed in this direction

04:25.533 --> 04:28.536
and knocked the poor lady
right out of her shoe.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.507
No skid.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.343
Driver didn't even try to stop.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.278
Maybe he didn't see her
until it was too late.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.515
Maybe.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.488
There's the skids.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.857
Let me borrow your camera,
Chris.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.892
Yes, sir.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.969
Rubber from the scuffs rises

05:02.002 --> 05:04.472
in the direction
of the victim, meaning...

05:04.505 --> 05:05.739
Driver was gunning for her.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.509
Next of kin might know who.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.444
Coworker said she was single.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.613
Raising two foster kids.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.882
All right.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.484
CACO needs to find those kids.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.485
Tell them what happened,

05:17.518 --> 05:19.387
or bring them
into the office.

05:19.420 --> 05:23.824
And maybe the kids can tell us
who might be behind all this.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.529
Boys are biological brothers.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.663
Social worker said

05:29.697 --> 05:31.465
that Maggie went
beyond usual fostering,

05:31.499 --> 05:32.466
became their mother

05:32.500 --> 05:33.634
in every way.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.469
They got any other family?

05:35.503 --> 05:36.504
Dad's a John Doe.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.671
Mother's a junkie,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.339
whereabouts unknown.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.382
Here, here you go.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.418
You hungry?

05:54.422 --> 05:55.523
Hey, CJ.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.791
I need to talk to your brother.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.428
Just-just be
right over there, okay?

06:07.801 --> 06:10.103
We need your help.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.772
Can you think of anyone

06:11.805 --> 06:14.174
who might want to hurt Maggie?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.909
Anyone she might have had
a problem with?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.778
I thought you said
this was a hit-and-run.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.581
That's an accident, right?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.550
We're going with the theory

06:22.583 --> 06:24.184
it was intentional.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.421
So we're following up
all the possibilities.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.424
Pride, social worker's here.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.626
I'm Sumner St. Croix.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.894
My agency works with DCF.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.463
Where will the boys be going?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.130
I'll take CJ to an
emergency placement

06:37.164 --> 06:39.132
with a foster family,
and my assistant here will

06:39.166 --> 06:40.501
drop Danny off
at a group home.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.603
You're separating them?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.804
Well, they're brothers.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.938
Yeah, I ain't going nowhere

06:44.972 --> 06:46.640
without CJ.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.208
Danny, you know the rules.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.877
You're too old
for an emergency placement,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.912
and those group homes
won't take kids under 13.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.747
Man, that's crap, all right?
He stays with me.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.483
Dial back the attitude, kid.
PRIDE: Whoa, whoa!

06:55.516 --> 06:56.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, look, hey.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.652
Grab your breath here!

06:58.686 --> 07:00.621
Listen, they've been
through a lot, all right?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.523
How about showing
a little compassion?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.592
Sorry.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.527
I'm doing the best I can
with the resources available.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.631
We're gonna make sure that
you see your brother tomorrow.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.669
It's all right, CJ.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.505
Just go with him.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.874
No! I want my brother!

07:20.908 --> 07:22.075
Please!

07:22.109 --> 07:24.044
Danny!

07:25.278 --> 07:26.714
Danny!

07:27.915 --> 07:29.583
Please, Danny!

07:30.884 --> 07:33.220
Damn, damn, damn.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.855
Damn!

07:49.603 --> 07:51.839
I called the social worker
at the group home.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.074
He's getting the boys together
for a visit this afternoon.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.108
Do me a favor.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.744
Make sure it
actually happens?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.145
Yeah.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.180
Kids have had their whole lives
turned upside down.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.916
They need each other.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.919
I ran Petty Officer Barringer's
financials.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.188
Nothing that raises a red flag.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.190
Her biggest splurge
in the last month

08:10.223 --> 08:12.926
was on her boys' shoes
at Nike Town.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.829
Small savings account, IRA,

08:15.863 --> 08:18.599
and the largest withdrawal
within the past year was $400.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.033
No drinking, no drugs.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.902
People say she was devoted
to those boys.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.103
Her coworker

08:23.136 --> 08:25.906
did say that she showed up
an hour late

08:25.939 --> 08:28.809
for work that morning
and was upset.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.143
What's that about?

08:30.177 --> 08:32.880
Upset was all
they could give us.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.982
Upset and run over
in a parking lot

08:35.015 --> 08:36.950
seems like a long throw to me.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.590
Sebastian.

08:42.623 --> 08:46.326
"The nerd posse requests
your presence."

08:46.359 --> 08:49.797
All right, Christopher,
head back to Maggie's office.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.600
See if it's possible

08:52.633 --> 08:55.669
that whatever upset her
in the morning

08:55.703 --> 08:58.105
could've come roaring back
that night.

08:58.138 --> 09:02.142
Brody and I will check in
with our man in the lab.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.312
Don't you need more than
one nerd to make a posse?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.214
Oh, I'm not the
only nerd in it.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.050
See, there's, uh, Einstein,
Newton, Tesla,

09:10.083 --> 09:11.919
and this performance artist
named Hermie Hawthorne,

09:11.952 --> 09:13.253
who spent three weeks

09:13.286 --> 09:15.322
in an enclosed glass box
with six snakes.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.090
We're kind of like
the Justice League,

09:17.124 --> 09:18.592
except with more
pocket protectors.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.193
And snakes.

09:20.227 --> 09:24.097
Okay, so, I used
forensic animation

09:24.131 --> 09:25.633
to recreate the incident.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.000
This sequence depicts

09:27.034 --> 09:30.170
the, uh, dent that the vehicle
made in the parked car.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.739
Now, based on
the physical evidence,

09:31.772 --> 09:33.340
the vehicle involved
was a sedan,

09:33.373 --> 09:37.244
as opposed to a SUV, van,
pickup or truck.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.912
I'm using laypersons terms here.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.047
We appreciate that.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.882
I also, uh,

09:41.915 --> 09:44.051
collected pigment polymers
from the arma delinquat.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.085
That didn't last long.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.353
Um, uh, paint flakes

09:46.386 --> 09:48.055
left in the dent.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.957
They allowed me to determine
the vehicle's color.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.726
It's a shade of gray.
Make and model?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.762
I'm still working on it,
but I did notice

09:54.795 --> 09:56.196
something interesting
on the headlight.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.298
There's this thick layer
of grime on the bits.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.934
It appears to be inorganic,
but I'll run tests.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.302
All right, meantime,
let's get a BOLO out

10:02.335 --> 10:04.237
for a gray sedan with
a smashed headlight.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.373
I'll contact the body shops.
And I'll check in with Loretta.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.041
Oh, uh, just to warn you,
Dr. Wade's in there

10:08.075 --> 10:09.276
with the oldest son.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.813
With Danny?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.848
Yeah, he came by;
he wanted to see his mother.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.988
She hated being in the dark.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.691
Always slept
with all the lights on,

10:23.724 --> 10:26.794
even the ones
in that damn closet.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.796
How did you and CJ

10:28.829 --> 10:30.297
come to live with Maggie?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.132
Our mom just
kind of took off.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.701
Took off?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.002
She split.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.103
One day, we woke up,

10:36.136 --> 10:39.006
she took all her stuff
and she was gone.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.043
How old were you?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.978
I was 12, CJ was four.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.081
I had to take care of him,
so I started skipping school.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.282
Got into some trouble.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.351
When I got caught,
they stuck CJ

10:51.384 --> 10:52.953
with Maggie.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.022
Did two years in juvie.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.057
When I got out,
Maggie took me in.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.698
They got any idea
who could've done this to her?

11:04.732 --> 11:07.735
Your hand-- why don't you come
let me see it.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.174
Yeah, I get you're some type
of doctor or whatever,

11:14.207 --> 11:17.878
but it don't really look like
your patients do so good.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.412
Don't be a smart-ass.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.982
Hand. Now.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.718
It's infected.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.954
There's bacteria
in here.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.222
It does kind of hurt.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.095
Ah!

11:35.128 --> 11:39.032
It's crazy the bubbles
H2O2 gives off.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.902
That's your body's enzymes
reacting

11:41.935 --> 11:44.738
to the hydrogen peroxide.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.807
H2O2.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.241
You interested in chemistry?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.778
You don't got
to do all that.
Do what?

11:50.811 --> 11:52.179
Act like you care.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.181
Do I look like a woman

11:54.214 --> 11:55.983
who acts her way through life?

11:56.016 --> 11:58.018
No, you don't.
No, I don't.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.754
Everybody always acting like
they got your back.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.156
Even Maggie.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.159
She kept saying
she was gonna adopt us.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.096
But in the end,

12:09.129 --> 12:11.431
things always got a way
of not working out.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.835
Look, no matter
what anybody tells you,

12:14.868 --> 12:16.837
you're alone in this world.

12:16.870 --> 12:20.273
Once you get that down,
nobody can hurt you.

12:22.342 --> 12:26.446
I bet most people you feed
that line to believe you.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.283
Thanks for fixing
the hand.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.121
WADE:
There's a good kid in there.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.789
With some bumps
along the way.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.792
Doesn't mean he doesn't deserve
a second chance.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.427
He'll be 18 soon,

12:40.460 --> 12:44.064
and DCF will literally
put him out on the street.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.366
Happy birthday.
You're homeless.
Mm-hmm.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.136
WADE:
Okay, I'm putting time of death

12:49.169 --> 12:51.104
somewhere around 9:15.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.907
And beyond the injuries
of the accident,

12:53.941 --> 12:57.177
she has fractures
in the L1 and L2 vertebrae

12:57.210 --> 13:01.048
due to malnourishment
in her formative years.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.317
The enamel degradation
on her teeth suggests

13:04.351 --> 13:07.988
a lack of dental care
as a child.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.824
Grew up poor.
Mm-hmm.

13:10.858 --> 13:14.361
And she didn't become bitter
or selfish.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.364
Was willing to take
in these two kids.

13:20.167 --> 13:25.072
There has to be a way to
keep these two boys together.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.174
Tough to fight the system.

13:29.209 --> 13:32.045
Have we met before?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.619
So what are we
doing here exactly?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.622
Folks at Maggie's office didn't
think there was a work reason

13:42.655 --> 13:45.358
for her to be upset,
but I got her phone.

13:45.392 --> 13:49.096
Petty Officer Barringer
sent a bunch of e-mails

13:49.129 --> 13:51.331
to a general address at
Community Foster Partnership.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.500
CFP.
What's that?

13:53.533 --> 13:56.870
It's a private social services
agency that the city pays for

13:56.904 --> 13:58.205
to work with foster families.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.941
All of Maggie's e-mails
was saying that CFP

14:00.974 --> 14:03.977
was sitting on the money
that was intended for the kids.

14:04.011 --> 14:08.916
Then on the day she was killed,
she sent them this.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.018
"You leave me no choice
but to go to the press

14:11.051 --> 14:15.322
and expose you for the lousy
cheating thieves you are."

14:15.355 --> 14:18.225
That's a threat.
CFP respond?

14:18.258 --> 14:21.995
Five minutes later she received
a call from someone from CFP.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.998
Then after the call,
Maggie sent a text

14:25.032 --> 14:27.500
to someone named
Jane Trahan.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.337
"Meeting with CFP at 5:00."

14:30.370 --> 14:33.240
Jane Trahan
lives here.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.675
You don't know how I wish
we could take in Maggie's boys,

14:35.708 --> 14:38.311
but we're already fostering
a set of twins and their sister.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.381
Is that how y'all met Maggie,
through fostering?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.216
She spoke at a workshop
for families

14:43.250 --> 14:44.684
who have issues
with CFP.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.186
What kind of issues?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.288
My issue. They suck.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.023
Joe.
What?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.424
We have to get six types
of approval

14:51.458 --> 14:53.660
before we can get money
for services that the kids need.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.162
Medical, dental,
psychological.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.596
And no matter what the request,

14:56.629 --> 14:58.298
we get delays
or outright denials.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.968
We have to pay
for the services ourselves.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.436
JANE: Or the kids go without.
That's what Maggie was fighting.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.238
She was in
search-and-destroy mode.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.240
She was out to get him.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.675
Who's him?

15:08.708 --> 15:10.310
Sumner St. Croix.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.511
He's the only one
anybody ever deals with

15:11.544 --> 15:12.980
over at CFP.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.281
St. Croix. He's the guy

15:14.314 --> 15:15.515
who picked up the boys
the other night.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.716
Horrible man.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.285
I told you.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.352
When we heard what
happened to Maggie,

15:19.386 --> 15:20.587
I said we should call

15:20.620 --> 15:22.255
to make sure
that someone knew about

15:22.289 --> 15:24.291
this con man St. Croix.
Guy's a social worker.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.393
A million a year.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.261
A million dollars a year?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.529
Maggie looked it up.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.465
A million is what
they pay CFP, and CFP

15:32.499 --> 15:35.068
is Sumner St. Croix.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.570
GIRL:
Dad, we're thirsty.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.406
Thank you, guys.
We'll help ourselves out.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.341
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.244
Messing with his
million-a-year contract.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.446
That's motive.
I'll call Pride.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.449
Tell him to meet us at CFP.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.418
ST. CROIX:
You got a warrant?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.153
Can have one
in minutes.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.721
Now and minutes
are different things.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.156
I'll call Judge Volkey.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.291
We'll wait right
here for you.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.694
Did some digging,

16:01.728 --> 16:03.496
Mr. St. Croix.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.632
Before New Orleans,

16:05.665 --> 16:08.568
you were operating CFP
out of Fayetteville.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.270
City sued you

16:10.303 --> 16:12.372
for fraud.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.507
And you got your contract

16:14.541 --> 16:17.444
claiming you got a whole army of
social workers on your payroll.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.979
And really, it's just you.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.750
Collecting all the money.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.418
Denying services.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.255
That lawsuit was dropped.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.556
Dropped for the moment.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.091
Called our contact

16:31.124 --> 16:33.060
at the Fed.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.428
We're told they're currently
in the process of indicting you.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.198
Fraud, tax evasion.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.466
Stealing from foster kids.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.701
That's classy with a "K,"
my friend.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.671
What's this?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.206
Just my files.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.108
Well, if I didn't know better,

16:48.141 --> 16:50.743
I'd say you're
destroying evidence.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.282
I did not
kill that woman.
PRIDE: No?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.517
So then where were you
last night around 9:15?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.319
I want my lawyer.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.355
Fine. Come down to our offices.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.823
We'll get your lawyer.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.326
Everything checks out,
you're off the hook.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.527
Either way,
you're probably

17:07.560 --> 17:08.695
facing 30 years.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.231
Okay.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.499
But I need one more thing.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.303
Tell my wife...

17:16.336 --> 17:18.338
I got in over my head.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.808
Wait!

17:50.437 --> 17:52.705
Just got off the phone
with St. Croix's lawyer.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.442
He and St. Croix were at
the U.S. attorney's office

17:55.475 --> 17:57.477
until after 10:00 p.m.
last night.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.845
Settlement conference.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.780
10:00 p.m. is
too late for him

18:00.813 --> 18:02.282
to have been there
to kill Maggie.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.151
Plus, if the Feds
were indicting,

18:04.184 --> 18:05.685
there's no reason
to kill her.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.521
Cat was already
out of the bag.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.758
Yeah, it was a dead end,
literally.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.328
Loretta's got something.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.630
Hey, King, if you don't mind,

18:17.664 --> 18:20.233
uh, I got a brother thing
I need to take care of.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.702
Brody, you're with me.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.471
Tell Cade hello for me.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.139
Appreciate it.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.210
"Willing to share.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.545
"Takes therapy seriously.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.382
Willing to be honest
with his feelings."

18:35.415 --> 18:37.884
Yeah, I know.
I was there, I heard.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.219
So then how about

18:39.252 --> 18:40.720
backing off
just a little?

18:40.753 --> 18:42.889
Well, you know I'm on you
'cause I care.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.857
Try caring a little less.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.360
Come on, follow. I got somebody
else I want you to meet.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.429
Hey, I got to get back to work.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.663
Hey, two minutes.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.865
Okay.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.301
Mind if I come on in?

18:54.334 --> 18:55.768
WOMAN: Yeah, yeah,
sure, okay.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.836
Great, I'll include
it in the report,

18:56.869 --> 18:58.171
and I'll get it out tonight.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.340
Okay, thanks again. Bye.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.809
Hey, Cade, how can I...

19:04.444 --> 19:06.179
Chris.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.447
Savannah.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.915
Well, Cade kept telling me

19:08.948 --> 19:10.583
he was gonna bring you by
to say hello.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.619
Did he?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.525
How long you been...

19:18.558 --> 19:19.792
What, in New Orleans?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.228
About a year.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.962
I moved here
after I got my masters.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.865
That's not a surprise.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.467
What do you mean?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.202
Well, you were always smart.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.970
That's why I sat behind you
in Dragonbreath's class.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.306
Peeking over your shoulder.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.542
Checking my answers.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.277
Oh, is that what you were doing
back there?

19:38.245 --> 19:39.879
You look good, Lasalle.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.848
Well, you still got
all your hair.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.383
So do you.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.855
I got to take this.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.923
Don't be a stranger now,
all right?

19:54.594 --> 19:57.264
This is Savannah.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.466
You didn't care if I met
your counselor at all.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.235
Hey, like I said,
I know I'm well.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.636
Hey, come on.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.405
Look, don't be ticked off.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.341
All right, I'm just trying
to set the table for you.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.477
Yeah, well,
I don't need my table set.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.379
Really?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.248
'Cause last time I checked,
she's the one that got away.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.486
Man, I got to go.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.255
I'll clean your house,

20:22.289 --> 20:24.324
I'll paint your walls,
I'll hook you up.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.992
I'm full service, baby brother.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.828
WADE: With all the fissures,
fractures and breaks,

20:28.861 --> 20:32.332
it took a while to
catalog, but when I did,

20:32.365 --> 20:36.002
I found one hairline fracture
on the left ulna

20:36.035 --> 20:38.004
which is not from this incident.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.508
It's consistent
with a defensive wound.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.010
You're saying there was a fight
before she was hit by the car.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.778
The fracture
is a month or so old.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.915
Not professionally set,
which suggests...

20:48.948 --> 20:50.417
Domestic violence.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.884
That would be my assessment.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.052
We got any information

20:53.085 --> 20:54.954
on a significant other,
current or ex?

20:54.987 --> 20:56.589
Nothing so far,
but I'll re-canvass

20:56.623 --> 20:58.024
her neighbors and colleagues.
All right, do that.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.526
I'll talk to CJ and Danny.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.294
All right.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.962
If the kids suspected someone,
don't you think

21:02.995 --> 21:04.297
they'd say something?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.434
Or is that not the real reason

21:07.467 --> 21:08.768
you're going to see them?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.803
Troubled kid.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.340
Record, anger issues.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.974
Anger issues is a defense.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.676
Loretta, I get it.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.011
You want to give this kid
the benefit of the doubt,

21:19.045 --> 21:22.915
but we can't ignore what's
right in front of our faces.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.655
Dwayne.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.358
Danny's been in juvie.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.893
You come at him,
a cop accusing him,

21:33.926 --> 21:37.630
he's gonna clam up
no matter what he knows.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.366
You want to come with?

21:39.399 --> 21:41.368
I thought you'd never ask.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.406
Huh, the infection's gone.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.107
Wound's healing nicely.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.042
If you do say
so yourself.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.945
Danny, there is something

21:52.979 --> 21:54.080
you could help us with.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.115
Was Maggie seeing anyone?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.385
Probably.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.652
She didn't really

21:59.686 --> 22:01.921
used to talk about
stuff like that.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.089
She said if there was
someone important,

22:03.122 --> 22:04.424
she'd let us know.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.992
Why?

22:06.025 --> 22:09.429
Do you think maybe
some boyfriend maybe did this?

22:09.462 --> 22:10.930
WADE:
Well...

22:10.963 --> 22:12.932
Maggie had an injury.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.468
Looks like it came
from defending herself

22:15.502 --> 22:17.136
in a fight.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.472
Altercation would've
been about a month ago.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.107
Any idea what might
have happened?

22:21.140 --> 22:22.675
No.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.377
What you trying to say?

22:24.411 --> 22:26.145
Ever have any problems
with Maggie?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.980
Problems?

22:28.014 --> 22:29.749
Things get out of hand,
you and her?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.150
What, you think I hit her?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.085
We're not accusing you
of anything, Danny.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.854
Nah, man, nothing like that
ever went down.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.590
BOY: Shut your damn mouth!
Man, say that again!

22:37.624 --> 22:39.926
Don't need to!
Hey! Hey, break it up!

22:39.959 --> 22:41.093
Hey, hey, hey,
knock it off.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.395
BOY: Anytime
you want to go!

22:43.830 --> 22:46.433
I hope this isn't out of line,
but I've made...

22:46.466 --> 22:47.867
Don't bother.
Danny.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.669
Look, you see
what he just said to me?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.604
I should've
seen this coming!

22:51.638 --> 22:53.072
Like I'd ever!

22:53.105 --> 22:54.441
Look, the only people

22:54.474 --> 22:55.842
left to take care
of CJ and me

22:55.875 --> 22:57.076
are CJ and me.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.111
I just wish everybody
would back the hell off!

23:13.225 --> 23:15.428
BRODY: Went to Maggie's
apartment building,

23:15.462 --> 23:17.764
asked about this
potential boyfriend.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.567
What were you just looking at?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.435
Uh, nothing.
Wasn't nothing.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.536
You had a face.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.937
No face.
Yes face.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.539
Total face.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.575
What were you saying about
Maggie's apartment?

23:29.842 --> 23:32.845
Her neighbor says that
she was seeing someone.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.847
She kept it from the boys
for two reasons.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.616
Number one, she didn't
want them to get invested

23:36.649 --> 23:38.885
in someone who wasn't
real, and number two,

23:38.918 --> 23:41.754
her boyfriend is the guy
who owns the sandwich shop,

23:41.788 --> 23:43.856
the one Danny works for.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.024
Hmm.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.893
Are you sure you
weren't looking at...

23:46.926 --> 23:49.796
porn or something
on your computer?

23:53.866 --> 23:54.834
Sebastian!

23:54.867 --> 23:56.803
Yeah, hi!

23:56.836 --> 23:58.471
I have some more information

23:58.505 --> 23:59.939
about the vehicle
that hit our victim.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.140
Is now a good time?

24:01.173 --> 24:03.776
It couldn't be any better.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.979
All right, so I realized
that the pigment polymers, uh,

24:07.013 --> 24:09.115
didn't have any silicones,
which means that the paint

24:09.148 --> 24:10.883
was made before 1999.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.720
But then I discovered
that they did have

24:13.753 --> 24:16.088
thixotropic agents,
which means that it was made

24:16.122 --> 24:17.724
after 1994.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.726
I know we'll get there soon.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.094
Yeah, okay, so that
the pigment matches paint

24:22.128 --> 24:25.932
that GM used on both the, uh,
Camaro and the Trans Am

24:25.965 --> 24:28.668
between 1994 and 1999.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.970
Nice. Thank you, buddy.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.639
Don't thank me.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.040
Thank the nerd posse.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.175
Nice pic.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.511
Name of the boyfriend
at the sandwich shop?

24:38.545 --> 24:40.112
Anthony Antonelli.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.849
Let's see what kind
of car he drives.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.851
ANTHONY:
I don't own a car.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.553
I don't even drive.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.688
I got in a wreck when I was 16,

24:48.721 --> 24:50.757
two weeks after
getting my license.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.125
Decided that was
the world telling me

24:53.159 --> 24:54.927
maybe I should give it up.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.197
You and Maggie Barringer,
you guys dated, right?

24:58.230 --> 25:00.266
Yeah, why?

25:00.299 --> 25:02.101
She was killed two nights ago.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.736
Killed?

25:03.770 --> 25:04.904
Maggie?

25:06.973 --> 25:10.743
Whoa, you guys don't think
I had something to do with it?

25:10.777 --> 25:11.911
No.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.212
No, Maggie and I were good.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.881
She just wanted
to slow things down.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.215
She say why?

25:16.248 --> 25:18.017
It seemed like something
with the kids.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.053
Lasalle.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.826
What's with the gray Camaro?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.160
Thought you said
you didn't own a car.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.862
That's Danny's car.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.598
Checked with the DMV;
Danny doesn't have a car.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.999
Maggie drove a Honda.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.100
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.002
All right, Danny said he wanted

25:36.035 --> 25:38.004
to start making some deliveries,
get some tips.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.007
I told he needed a car;
he showed up with that.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.815
Danny should've been back
by now.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.717
I mean, we have a curfew.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.251
Danny's locker?

25:52.284 --> 25:55.955
Yeah. We tell the kids
to keep everything locked up.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.858
Well, he cleared out.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.193
I got to call my boss.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.974
What's with the hat
and the feather?

26:15.007 --> 26:16.375
Robin Hood.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.878
Dealers use cartoon stamps
on their product.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.947
Branding in the streets
is no different

26:20.980 --> 26:22.949
than corporate America.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.052
All right,
so what is Robin Hood?

26:26.085 --> 26:27.253
PCP.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.288
Angel dust.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.991
So Maggie confronts him
about what he's been up to,

26:32.024 --> 26:33.359
maybe even threatens
to turn him in.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.927
Then that night, he shows up

26:34.961 --> 26:36.295
and runs her down?

26:36.328 --> 26:39.799
Hell hath no fury like a
pissed off teenage drug dealer.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.882
They told me I had a visitor.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.951
I was hoping it would be
one of my honeys.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.987
Sorry to disappoint,

27:01.020 --> 27:03.022
Ross P., but I need a favor.

27:03.055 --> 27:06.258
Just as bad as
the honeys.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.961
Photo of this
kid is Danny.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.231
So you say.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.934
And Robin Hood is...

27:14.967 --> 27:17.336
Some kick-ass angel dust.

27:17.369 --> 27:18.771
Oh, yeah.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.409
Give you a nice long high.

27:23.442 --> 27:27.346
Make you want to hop
on a cotton candy dragon

27:27.379 --> 27:29.949
and leap on a damn rainbow,
you know?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.951
It's crazy.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.186
I think the kid
is dealing it

27:34.220 --> 27:36.255
and might have killed
his foster mother.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.890
Need to know
who his associates are

27:37.924 --> 27:39.859
and where we can find him.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.127
Oh, sure thing, you know?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.962
I'll just,
I'll just step on out

27:42.995 --> 27:45.798
and give my-my cell phone
a ring-a-ding-ding.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.200
Hold up, hold up.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.702
Oh, what's that?

27:49.736 --> 27:51.170
I'm still in prison?

27:51.203 --> 27:53.973
Oh, I'm still in prison.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.009
That's 'cause you lied to me.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.111
All right, but
helping me here

27:59.145 --> 28:02.281
will get you one step closer
to getting off the naughty list.

28:02.314 --> 28:05.384
Done. Done.

28:05.417 --> 28:09.288
One trip around the yard,
I'll get you what you need.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.357
Danny, Robin Hood.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.292
You be my eyes and ears.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.327
Oh, Lasalle, I'll be your hands,
your feet,

28:15.361 --> 28:17.029
your spleen and your kidney,

28:17.063 --> 28:19.265
you get me out of here
any quicker.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.338
Thank you.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.477
Chris?

28:31.510 --> 28:34.080
When it rains, it pours.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.381
What are you doing here?

28:35.414 --> 28:37.049
We have a satellite program.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.050
You?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.752
Business.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.921
I hear you have a week
to ask me out.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.023
Oh, gosh. Cade?

28:44.056 --> 28:46.025
He's a man with a plan.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.094
You know, he's mentioned
wanting nieces and nephews.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.328
I'm literally gonna kill him.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.997
Don't worry; I told him

28:51.030 --> 28:52.131
it's sort of a
conflict of interest,

28:52.164 --> 28:53.265
you asking out the
head of the clinic

28:53.299 --> 28:54.266
where he's doing his therapy.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.168
So I'm off the hook.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.503
Do you want to be off the hook?

28:57.536 --> 28:59.405
That's not what I asked.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.975
It's a good sign.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.311
Him looking beyond himself,
talking about the future.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.113
He's working hard.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.315
Oh, and...

29:09.348 --> 29:12.384
no, you're not off the hook.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.489
SEBASTIAN: So even though
we've identified the vehicle,

29:17.523 --> 29:18.958
I kept trying to
reconstruct that headlight,

29:18.991 --> 29:20.793
but of course,
I got nowhere,

29:20.827 --> 29:21.994
'cause it's like trying
to put together

29:22.028 --> 29:23.495
one of those crazy
thousand-piece puzzles

29:23.529 --> 29:25.464
where the whole image
is just one color.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.800
I mean, give me a point
of reference on those, you know?

29:27.834 --> 29:30.536
Like a fire hobgoblin
or a basilisk, something to...

29:32.038 --> 29:34.040
A basilisk is
a reptilian monster

29:34.073 --> 29:36.108
that petrifies
with a single gaze.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.309
Gaze like this?

29:37.343 --> 29:39.345
Yeah, you-you got it down.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.147
Any-who, uh,
what's important

29:41.180 --> 29:43.282
is not the headlight itself,
but what was on it.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.917
This, um, grime.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.385
Specifically silica,

29:46.418 --> 29:48.988
sulfur compounds
and synthetic rubbers.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.056
Sounds like tires.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.290
Yeah, what they're made of.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.125
Uh, I'm thinking

29:53.159 --> 29:56.162
just before the murder,
last place the car was,

29:56.195 --> 29:58.230
somewhere where they're either
destroying or making tires.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.900
Nearest tire factory
is 400 miles from here.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.201
SEBASTIAN: I mean,
I can run another test,

30:02.234 --> 30:04.103
try and narrow things down

30:04.136 --> 30:05.838
so we don't have to jump
to conclusions.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.539
No need to jump, just
maybe a little hop.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.108
How about this?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.509
Reworked Rubber Corp.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.211
Recycles tires
and turns them

30:12.244 --> 30:14.580
into ground coverings for
playgrounds and such,

30:14.613 --> 30:16.115
and there is one
in Mid-City.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.316
All right, let's follow up.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.018
And then we get back,
you can tell me

30:19.051 --> 30:20.352
what the hell a
fire hobgoblin is.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.389
It's the most dangerous
of all the hobgoblins.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.590
That was obvious.

30:24.623 --> 30:25.958
MAN:
Never seen the kid.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.559
PRIDE:
What about the car?

30:27.593 --> 30:30.096
Sure, it's
Bull Costigan's.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.864
Who's Bull Costigan?

30:31.898 --> 30:34.400
He's a sorter on one
of my work crews.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.968
He in trouble?

30:36.002 --> 30:37.069
First we heard of him.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.871
Bull here?

30:38.905 --> 30:40.439
No, he called me
two days ago.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.142
Said he threw his back out
and needed to see a doctor.

30:43.175 --> 30:46.178
What do they say about
no good deed going unpunished?

30:46.212 --> 30:47.479
I mean, I tried to give
the guy a chance.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.348
Figured he served his time.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.350
Three months out of prison
after six years

30:51.383 --> 30:53.185
on drug charges.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.221
Let me guess.
PCP is on the list.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.123
Bull here Monday?

30:57.156 --> 30:59.658
Monday. Yeah, I think.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.193
Know what time he left?

31:01.227 --> 31:03.229
I thought he was
here all day.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.164
I can't be sure; guys
punch each other out,

31:05.197 --> 31:07.166
but we got CCTV.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.901
Can we see the video?

31:08.935 --> 31:10.970
Sure, we got it.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.671
So, let's say that Bull
is the dealer.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.206
Danny's working for him.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.441
Maggie finds out
what's going on,

31:15.474 --> 31:17.509
Danny warns Bull
that she's on his case.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.211
Yeah, both Bull and Danny

31:19.245 --> 31:21.247
would want to keep her
from making trouble.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.985
There's the car.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.154
There's Bull.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.388
Freeze that.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.257
MAN:
Hey, boss, can you sign this?

31:31.290 --> 31:34.160
Knock yourself out.
Yeah, thanks.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.495
Bull left at 4:30.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.564
Gives him plenty of time
to get into town,

31:38.597 --> 31:40.532
be there when Maggie
comes out of work.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.501
Or Bull delivers
the car to Danny

31:42.534 --> 31:44.270
and he runs Maggie down.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.538
The only way of knowing
if Danny or Bull was driving

31:46.572 --> 31:48.574
is find one of them.

31:50.276 --> 31:53.112
Lasalle.
Got a 411 on Danny.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.653
What do we got?

32:01.687 --> 32:05.091
Ross P. says this is where the
Robin Hood PCP is being pushed.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.392
Any sign of Danny or Bull?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.260
No one in and out
of the house

32:08.294 --> 32:09.295
since I been here,

32:09.328 --> 32:10.596
but I got movement

32:10.629 --> 32:12.631
in the back window.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.137
All right.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.738
You take the back.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.974
Let's do this.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.618
NCIS!

32:54.706 --> 32:57.209
Don't move, Danny.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.477
Danny!
Danny!

33:00.479 --> 33:02.614
Hands up.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.784
You got anything on you?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.453
Looky here.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.455
Key to the Camaro.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.690
Where's Bull, Danny?

33:11.723 --> 33:14.226
Huh Danny?

33:14.260 --> 33:16.262
Who's idea was it
to run Maggie over?

33:16.295 --> 33:17.596
I don't know.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.765
Well, this car, this
car you've been driving,

33:19.798 --> 33:22.701
that's the one
that killed her.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.803
It wasn't me.
Danny.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.773
Danny, look at me.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.441
If you are telling
the truth,

33:29.475 --> 33:31.610
if you really had nothing
to do with this,

33:31.643 --> 33:33.179
then you need to tell us

33:33.212 --> 33:35.247
where we can find Bull Costigan,
all right?

33:35.281 --> 33:36.648
Where is he, Danny?

33:36.682 --> 33:38.117
Look around.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.785
You gonna take
the fall for it.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.587
He's scum, Danny.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.290
He's a drug dealer, a murderer,
he's a piece of garbage.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.757
He's my father!

33:47.859 --> 33:49.761
Mine and CJ's.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.567
He's all we got.

34:08.847 --> 34:13.285
I asked you if you had any idea
who would want to hurt Maggie,

34:13.319 --> 34:15.321
and you said nope.

34:15.354 --> 34:17.356
And you lied to me.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.158
You looked me right in the eye.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.226
He said it wasn't him!

34:20.259 --> 34:21.460
And you believed him?

34:21.493 --> 34:23.329
I wanted to.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.331
Yes, he's my father.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.866
How'd your father find you after
he was locked up for six years?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.368
He showed up at the house.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.737
He wanted to take us right then.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.240
Maggie knew he was trouble.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.642
That why he hit her?

34:36.675 --> 34:38.777
She sent us outside.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.880
And she said she slipped
while they were talking.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.582
You wanted to believe that, too.

34:43.615 --> 34:46.118
He kept coming by the house
when she wasn't there.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.719
He kept giving me money.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.421
Look, CJ thought
it was great.

34:49.455 --> 34:52.424
He doesn't remember
what he used to be like.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.560
I knew he would use us.

34:54.593 --> 34:55.727
To deal the PCP.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.130
I didn't want no part of that.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.366
Did you tell him that?
Yeah, right.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.500
Okay, I figured
if I couldn't

35:01.533 --> 35:03.202
get away, the least I could do

35:03.235 --> 35:04.503
was help Maggie out
with some money.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.272
Drug money.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.375
Green money,
which was in short supply.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.211
Social worker called.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.812
CJ didn't come home
from school today.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.515
I-I got to go right now.
I got to go.

35:16.548 --> 35:17.716
Bull's got CJ, doesn't he?

35:18.484 --> 35:20.852
Sit down.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.455
You don't tell us where Bull is,

35:23.489 --> 35:26.858
he's gonna be gone, Danny.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.794
And he's gonna take CJ with him.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.365
Is that what you want
for your little brother?

35:47.279 --> 35:50.482
I'm supposed to bring the drugs
to the bus station.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.454
My dad will put CJ
on the bus with it.

35:55.487 --> 35:59.391
No one suspects a kid
with a backpack full of PCP.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.462
Okay.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.432
And then...

36:06.465 --> 36:09.301
Bull's gonna meet CJ
on the other end?

36:09.335 --> 36:11.937
Mobile.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.574
He said he can't risk driving
ten keys down the interstate.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.259
King, I don't see
Bull or CJ anywhere.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.361
Bus for Mobile leaves
in a few minutes.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.363
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

36:40.499 --> 36:41.833
Got them.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.869
Through the front.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.480
Hey, son.
Here you go.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.548
Dad says it's gonna be okay.
Ready?

36:56.582 --> 36:58.584
Let's go.

37:08.860 --> 37:12.564
Don't grab Bull till he's clear
of both the kids.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.572
BRODY:
I think he's made us.

37:20.606 --> 37:21.640
PRIDE:
Hold your positions.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.879
Stay where you are!

37:28.914 --> 37:30.482
Get inside, get inside.

37:30.516 --> 37:31.450
You, too!

37:31.483 --> 37:32.618
Get with him.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.052
Now! Move!

37:34.085 --> 37:36.688
Danny.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.590
Get my car, bring it here.

37:38.624 --> 37:39.991
No, don't-don't do that, Danny.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.627
Do as I tell you.
Danny.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.028
DANNY:
It's like I said.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.863
He's all we got!

37:45.797 --> 37:46.798
Go! Go!

37:48.534 --> 37:50.469
Let CJ go.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.037
Mind your damn business.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.406
Let's just talk this through.

37:54.440 --> 37:57.709
No talk. I'm taking my family
and I'm going.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.478
Nobody moves.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.046
I got nothing to lose.

38:01.079 --> 38:03.482
Stay in the car, Danny.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.616
Come on.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.652
Get in.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.488
Get in.

38:10.822 --> 38:11.923
Stay back!

38:11.957 --> 38:13.959
And don't try
to follow us!

38:17.729 --> 38:19.731
BULL:
Dan!

38:20.966 --> 38:22.501
Get off of me!

38:24.436 --> 38:25.904
Let me go!

38:27.406 --> 38:28.574
No, no.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.376
R-Relax.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.843
It's all right,
it's all right. Come on.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.912
You guys are okay.
You're okay.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.714
Get out.
You better watch out, Danny.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.983
It's all right.
I'll catch up with you, son.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.017
I'm not your son.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.652
Watch your mouth.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.090
Mm-hmm.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.859
Yes, please.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.461
Hang on a second.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.662
Danny?

38:53.031 --> 38:54.400
Go ahead.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.902
I appreciate it.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.804
Yes, I-I will.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.839
Yes. All right.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.410
We searched Bull's place.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.844
We found something that we think

39:05.877 --> 39:07.813
that Maggie may have
asked him to sign,

39:07.846 --> 39:10.516
dated the morning
of her death.

39:10.549 --> 39:11.950
Petition for relinquishment?

39:11.983 --> 39:14.653
It means that
your father

39:14.686 --> 39:17.556
gives up his rights
to you boys.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.391
She needed that

39:19.425 --> 39:22.661
so she could file this.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.130
Adoption petition.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.933
She was really gonna do it.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.035
She really was.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.906
Well, and I-I just, uh,
talked to the D.A.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.776
We're gonna work something
out on the drug charges.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.079
Hey, Doc Wade.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.050
Come all the way over here
to check on your patient?

39:45.083 --> 39:47.185
No. Mind if I join you?

39:47.218 --> 39:48.987
Not at all.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.056
I checked into DCF.

39:51.089 --> 39:54.793
They tell me you're applying
to be CJ's legal guardian.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.962
Turn 18 in a couple of weeks.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.464
I'm tired of being split up.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.998
Where will you live?

40:00.031 --> 40:01.032
Don't know yet.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.171
Well, I...

40:06.204 --> 40:09.174
I ask because I have a room
in my house

40:09.207 --> 40:10.942
that's large enough for two,

40:10.976 --> 40:13.779
and I could use

40:13.812 --> 40:15.614
a little help around the morgue.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.716
For someone who's interested
in science.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.117
Are you serious?

40:19.150 --> 40:21.453
I am.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.656
Can I go tell CJ?

40:24.690 --> 40:26.758
Yeah.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.096
Thank you.

40:35.634 --> 40:39.137
Hey, CJ, I got some news.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.575
You're taking
a troubled delinquent

40:43.609 --> 40:46.478
with a penchant
for dealing angel dust

40:46.512 --> 40:48.914
and his nine-year-old brother
into your home?

40:52.050 --> 40:54.152
Is that a good idea?

40:54.185 --> 40:56.988
No, it's not.

40:57.022 --> 40:59.758
But have we met before?

41:07.265 --> 41:09.668
Hey, I got your message.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.903
Cade's sponsor was worried,
so he contacted me.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.939
CADE:
Fore!

41:19.545 --> 41:21.112
Hey, baby brother!

41:21.146 --> 41:22.914
Savannah.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.583
Hey, so,

41:24.616 --> 41:27.185
I realize the paint
was all wrong.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.020
It-it didn't match the walls.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.255
Then I got to thinking,
I'm like, "What is really

41:30.288 --> 41:31.523
the problem here?
Like, what's really..."

41:31.557 --> 41:33.892
And then I realize, the walls.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.061
That's the problem!

41:38.296 --> 41:40.966
You don't like it?

41:40.999 --> 41:42.200
That's okay.

41:42.233 --> 41:43.034
That's all right.

41:43.068 --> 41:44.069
We can change it.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.236
I can make anything you want.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.672
Oh!

41:46.705 --> 41:48.139
Brought you another beer, sugar.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.808
Then I got one
for myself, too.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.309
Who is...

41:51.342 --> 41:52.844
Oh, this here is Windi.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.179
Met her this afternoon
at the hardware store.

41:54.212 --> 41:55.947
Say hello, Windi.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.248
Hello, Windi.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.617
She kills me.

41:58.650 --> 41:59.718
I love her. Here, hold that.

41:59.751 --> 42:00.819
Come on, help me

42:00.852 --> 42:02.554
get these drop cloths.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.859
I'd like to call
the clinic,

42:07.893 --> 42:10.195
see if I can get him
admitted for a temp hold.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.631
My guess,
he hasn't slept

42:12.664 --> 42:14.265
in three days.
You don't do something...

42:14.299 --> 42:16.101
Crash is coming.

42:16.134 --> 42:17.302
Hey.

42:17.335 --> 42:19.270
He had me fooled, too.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.243
All right, hey, Windi?

42:25.276 --> 42:28.680
Let's get some tarps
over this right here, okay?

42:28.714 --> 42:30.716
That way we don't get no paint
on the furniture.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.150
Hey, come here.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.753
Come here.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.254
Listen to me, Chris.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.856
When I get finished
with this tonight,

42:37.889 --> 42:40.191
