-got away with about 100 phones.
-Yeah, man. It's crazy out here.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.173
I mean, it's-it's that time
of year though, I guess.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.827

02:11.870 --> 02:13.437
Hey, yo, and that reminds me,

02:26.276 --> 02:27.408
Usual, gonna have the usual.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.453
You don't want to do
nothing different?

02:29.497 --> 02:31.629
No, man. Look, I got, I got

02:31.673 --> 02:33.457
-So I just... want to look good.
-Oh!

02:33.501 --> 02:34.893
Oh, you got a photo shoot

02:34.937 --> 02:37.287
-Yeah, man. I mean...

02:37.331 --> 02:38.593
Nah, man. It's just a write-up

02:38.636 --> 02:39.985
Yeah. My boy done
went all Hollywood.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.073
It's a write-up in a magazine,

02:41.117 --> 02:42.205
and they want
to take some pictures,

02:42.249 --> 02:43.859

02:43.902 --> 02:46.078
Hey, you dating Kim Kardashian

-That's good, though.
-It ain't no Hollywood, Bibby.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.301
-I ain't going

02:53.347 --> 02:55.087

Me and my girl snuck in the AMC

they got on there

03:02.269 --> 03:04.227

03:04.271 --> 03:06.838
-Guess!
-One.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.275
-Zero!
-Zero.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.406
It's sad, man.

Key and Peele put a movie out
with a cat in it,

03:11.756 --> 03:13.323
they put the cat on the poster.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.890
They dressed the cat up
like a nigga instead of

03:14.933 --> 03:16.674
putting two niggas that made
the movie on the poster.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.894
So was it a cat in a suit
or just looked like a nigga?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.330
