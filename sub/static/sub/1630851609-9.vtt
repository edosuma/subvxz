No, no, no, no, Toni,
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fix it.

Okay? I can fix this.

Can I tell you something?

27:53.759 --> 27:55.761
Anything.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.764
I used to work for
this newspaper, The Chronicle,

27:58.807 --> 28:00.896

I was writing a story.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.421
Big tainted water scandal
over at Fort Collins.

28:04.465 --> 28:07.076

28:14.127 --> 28:18.218
I couldn't get anybody
to go on the record.

And Ravi-- my old boss--
he kept saying

28:21.656 --> 28:24.703

he wouldn't run it.

I, um...

it was in the name of justice,

28:37.846 --> 28:42.372

the bad, but...

28:42.416 --> 28:45.245
