00:07.659 --> 00:09.226

this. You keep me over here,

kill Wallace because

I found out
I was gonna have a baby.

-That isn't Laila.
-What?

00:31.248 --> 00:33.076
BETH:
It's my niece. Ellie.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.209
You were making a mistake
going with Tessa,

00:35.252 --> 00:37.080
-and I couldn't let that happen.
-You have lost the right

00:37.124 --> 00:38.821

Look, I-I messed up.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.616
I-I really, really messed up,
and I'm-I'm sorry.

02:18.660 --> 02:23.273
And I-I know "sorry"
probably isn't enough.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.710
I mean, you can still be upset.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.104
You have every right to be.

to show you something.

Well, you don't trust me,
which I-I... I get it.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.774
But it is her.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.430
And, um, um, I also have this.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.693
Um...

02:52.911 --> 02:54.130
I think there's enough in here

02:54.174 --> 02:56.306
to prove that you didn't do it.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.656
Which is...
We need to get people talking,

02:58.700 --> 03:00.310
and to shame them
into reopening the case,

03:00.354 --> 03:03.095
and get all the attention
and resources we need

03:03.139 --> 03:05.402
to hire the best lawyers
and get you out of here.

03:07.491 --> 03:10.886
Look, I understand if you never
want to see me again,

03:10.929 --> 03:13.976
but I've never stopped working,
and I won't.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.760
Can I read it?

03:15.804 --> 03:18.198
Yeah, of course. Go for it.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.468
You know,
I used to think this was a,

03:27.511 --> 03:30.166
like a... like a whodunnit, but

03:30.210 --> 03:33.125
no one person did all of this.

03:34.431 --> 03:37.521
But somebody killed Wallace,
but...

03:37.565 --> 03:39.523
America's to blame,

03:39.567 --> 03:42.047
and that means
we're all to blame.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.572
Not you, obviously, but me--
I'm to blame.

03:44.615 --> 03:47.575

I am all those things,

03:55.452 --> 03:58.629
Yeah, it's really hard
to read this with you talking.

You can keep that copy.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.525
Marco?

04:24.568 --> 04:28.529
Hey. I just came home to get
another copy of my thing,

04:28.572 --> 04:30.270
because, of course,
I gave it to Toni,

04:30.313 --> 04:32.750
who loved it, by the way.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.840
What are you doing?

04:51.943 --> 04:54.119
Well... the fish is dead.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.296
-What?!
-Yeah.

04:56.339 --> 04:59.255
Did you feed her? Because
I distinctly remember saying,

04:59.299 --> 05:00.430
"Please feed the fish."

05:00.474 --> 05:02.040
Yeah, Beth, I-I fed her.

05:02.084 --> 05:04.129
Well, did you overfeed her?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.045
You know,

05:07.089 --> 05:09.265
sometimes...

05:09.309 --> 05:11.485

05:18.492 --> 05:20.798
Hey, um,

05:20.842 --> 05:24.367
you've been so patient with me
this year,

05:24.411 --> 05:27.544
propping me up
when I could barely stand.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.634
You've really...
you've-you've kept me alive.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.768
And then this story
comes along, and it's bigger

05:33.811 --> 05:35.987
and harder than anything
I've ever done before,

05:36.031 --> 05:38.816
and... I let it push you...

05:38.860 --> 05:40.905
push usout of the way.

05:42.603 --> 05:47.129
And I let that George thing get
completely out of hand.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.131
I mean, I don't know
what I'd have done

05:49.174 --> 05:52.264
if I'd found something like that
on... on your phone.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.441
I wouldn't have handled it
as maturely as you did.

05:54.484 --> 05:57.400
-That's for sure, so...
-Yeah.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.403
Just thank you for...

06:00.447 --> 06:03.319
being the bigger person.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.148
Yeah.

you're like Susan.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.905
I-I know you don't like that.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.907
Well, I mean,

06:25.950 --> 06:28.736
I am like her, I guess.

Wait.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.827
Are you saying I'm right?

06:32.870 --> 06:34.829
Well, no.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.440
Hey, you're supposed
to be apologizing.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.442

06:39.486 --> 06:42.619
We'll get through this, okay?

06:42.663 --> 06:45.013
We do need to talk, though,
really talk.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.971

from me.

yeah, go ahead. Go.

-Oh, okay.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.509
I just...
I thought we'd agreed

12:51.553 --> 12:53.642
that you'd talk to me
about my article.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.905
Of course we will,
but business can always wait.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.733
Come meet the tribe.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.996
-Everyone, this is my daughter!
-Really?

13:00.040 --> 13:01.781
My baby bat flew home.
[laughs]

13:01.824 --> 13:03.826
-BETH: Do I have to do this?
-[indistinct chatter]

13:03.870 --> 13:05.785
-Who are all these people?
-So grown up.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.482
SUSAN:
Oh, come meet Andre.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.356
[playing soft, gentle melody]

13:12.400 --> 13:16.404
[indistinct chatter]

13:16.447 --> 13:18.493
How late do you expect
this is gonna go?

13:18.536 --> 13:21.322
-'Cause I-I really
do want to talk.
-No, I understand that.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.193
But Shane is having
too much fun.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.021
-[laughing]
-Which one is Shane?

13:25.065 --> 13:27.807
-["Islands in the Stream" plays]
-Oh.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.157
Oh.

13:30.200 --> 13:34.335
Tristram, you're clairvoyant!
That was our song.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.945
Right, baby bat?

13:35.989 --> 13:37.904
My God. I'll never forget it.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.341
It was, like, the end of 1984,

13:40.384 --> 13:43.561
and Beth's poor father
was freshly underground,

13:43.605 --> 13:45.563
and it was just the two of us.

13:45.607 --> 13:49.393
We were living in a hovel
above a laundromat on Sunset.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.830
Every day, I'd go

13:50.873 --> 13:53.441
to my copywriting job
for the Cipollone Brothers.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.052
But then, go home at night
and plunk away on my typewriter.

13:56.096 --> 13:59.664
But it was everything
we could do

13:59.708 --> 14:02.842
not to be overwhelmed
with grief.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.540
But you know,

14:05.583 --> 14:09.065
every time this baby bat heard
that song on the radio,

14:09.109 --> 14:11.111
she wanted me
to sing it with her.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.896
-Right?
-Yeah.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.855
-Come on! Come on!
-Oh, no, no, no.
Mom, please don't.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.944
-No, please don't.
-We're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it.

14:17.987 --> 14:21.121
-Come on. It's a tradition.
-No, I really don't want to.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.123
Come on! I'll play Dolly.
It's gonna be great.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.865
-Take it away, Kenny!
-WOMAN: Duet.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.475
-[Susan whooping]
-How great!

14:27.518 --> 14:28.824
-Oh, my God!
-BETH: Susan...

14:28.868 --> 14:31.653
Oh, come on.
It's gonna be fun. F-U-N.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.833
Sing the song.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.879
â™ª Baby, when I met you
there was peace unknownâ™ª

14:39.922 --> 14:42.229
[whooping, applause]

14:42.272 --> 14:46.494
â™ª I set out to get you
with a fine tooth combâ™ª

14:46.537 --> 14:48.931
â™ª I was soft insideâ™ª

14:48.975 --> 14:53.370
â™ª There was something
going onâ™ª

14:56.286 --> 14:58.767
â™ª You do something to me
that I can't explainâ™ª

14:58.810 --> 15:01.161
[whooping, applause]

15:01.204 --> 15:05.121
â™ª Hold me closer
and I feel no painâ™ª

15:05.165 --> 15:07.123
â™ª Every beat of my heartâ™ª

15:07.167 --> 15:11.867
â™ª We've got something going onâ™ª

15:13.260 --> 15:16.350
â™ª Tender love is blindâ™ª

15:16.393 --> 15:19.570
â™ª It requires a dedicationâ™ª

15:19.614 --> 15:23.531
â™ª All this love we feel
needs no conversationâ™ª

15:23.574 --> 15:27.578
â™ª We ride it together, ah, haâ™ª

15:27.622 --> 15:32.670
â™ª Making love
with each other, ah, haâ™ª

15:32.714 --> 15:34.977
â™ª Islands in the streamâ™ª

15:35.021 --> 15:37.545
â™ª That is what we areâ™ª

15:37.588 --> 15:39.416
â™ª No one in betweenâ™ª

15:39.460 --> 15:41.941
â™ª How can we be wrong?â™ª

15:41.984 --> 15:44.552
â™ª Sail away with meâ™ª

15:44.595 --> 15:47.250
â™ª To another worldâ™ª

15:47.294 --> 15:51.167
â™ª And we'll rely on each other,
ah, haâ™ª

15:51.211 --> 15:56.346
â™ª From one lover
to another, ah, haâ™ª

15:56.390 --> 15:58.435
Ah...

15:58.479 --> 16:01.482
â™ª I can't live without you
if the love was goneâ™ª

16:01.525 --> 16:03.440
[cheering, applause]

16:03.484 --> 16:08.141
â™ª Everything is nothing
if you got no oneâ™ª

16:08.184 --> 16:10.404
â™ª And you walk in the nightâ™ª

16:10.447 --> 16:14.930
â™ª Slowly losing sight
of the real thing...â™ª

16:14.974 --> 16:17.541
[rhythmic clapping]

16:17.585 --> 16:21.719
â™ª But that won't happen to us
and we got no doubt...â™ª

16:24.853 --> 16:26.681
Ah, my little sweet potato.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.683
Wasn't that fun? [laughs]

16:28.726 --> 16:30.598
I was offkey.

16:30.641 --> 16:34.036
But you had gusto. That's all
that matters. [laughs]

16:34.080 --> 16:36.734
[Beth laughs]

16:36.778 --> 16:39.999
Um, honey,
are you all right?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.959
Yeah, I've-I've been better.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.656
What's wrong?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.658
Well, it's the...

16:47.702 --> 16:50.487
the story that I've been writing
that I was telling you about.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.837
-Mm.
-It's probably the best work
I've ever done,

16:52.881 --> 16:55.057
but I-I... I can't get anybody
to run it.

16:55.101 --> 16:59.148
-Mm-hmm.
-So I was hoping
that you could ask Pima

16:59.192 --> 17:01.237
or-or Colton or-- I don't know--

17:01.281 --> 17:02.891
whoever Shane is-- um...

17:02.934 --> 17:05.067
NATASHA:
Oh, my God.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.330
Guys, come here.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.723
Sorry. We're just
in the middle of something.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.160
-[gasping]
-It's the same table!

17:11.204 --> 17:15.643
-Same pose.
-Fucking dead and deceased.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.166
Don't move. Don't move.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.776
-[phone cameras clicking]
-I'm sorry. You guys,

17:18.820 --> 17:20.604
-could you just stop
for a second?
-All right, pretend

17:20.648 --> 17:21.910
we're not here, act natural.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.868
Yeah, Beth,
can you look at your mom

17:23.912 --> 17:27.046
with, like,
a little more hopeful gaze?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.960
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Like when you were a child.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.484
-Mm-hmm.
-[cameras clicking]

17:30.527 --> 17:32.007
NATASHA:
Oh, so close. Come on.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.226
-I'm sorry about them.
-NATASHA: Oh, this is adorable.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.228
-No, you're not.
-NATASHA: No, no.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.360
-No, come back. Beth.
-Wait! Stop! You're ruining it!

17:37.404 --> 17:39.884
NATASHA: Yeah, just-just sit.
I'm just reframing.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.495
[excited chatter]

17:41.538 --> 17:43.627
I got one. Come see.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.023
Was it something that we did?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.416
Oh, God, no.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.983
She's done this
since she was little.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.376
-Mm.
-Back then, if she wasn't

17:53.420 --> 17:55.857
the center of attention,
then she'd run off

17:55.900 --> 17:58.120
and spend the night roaming
the streets like some

17:58.164 --> 18:00.122
average,
run-of-the-mill teenager.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.559
-Mm-hmm.
-It's just so disappointing.

18:17.313 --> 18:20.142
Do you do it to hurt me?

18:20.186 --> 18:21.970
Wander off like that
and cause a scene?

18:22.013 --> 18:23.841
Not everything is about you.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.148
Honey, it's been proven
time and again,

18:26.192 --> 18:27.932
everything is about the mother.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.326
Okay, fine, it's all about you.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.980
You happy?

18:32.023 --> 18:34.591
I'll be happy when you're happy.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.289
Oh, drop the act.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.465
Your friends aren't even here.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.554
[sighs]
Give me one of those.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.123
I thought smoking disgusted you.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.168
Yeah, it does.
It does disgust me.

18:56.135 --> 19:00.356
By the way, I was never roaming
the streets back then, okay?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.315
I was... I was sitting
under your window,

19:02.358 --> 19:03.881
or sitting on the porch,

19:03.925 --> 19:06.232
or I was standing here
in this exact spot,

19:06.275 --> 19:08.234
smoking your cigarettes,
for hours.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.932
Wishing you'd find me.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.152
Willing you to find me.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.328
But you never even looked.

19:15.371 --> 19:18.679
You'd just pour yourself a glass
of wine and run a bath.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.681
I know.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.683
You know?

19:24.337 --> 19:26.165
Well, then why didn't you come
find me?

19:26.208 --> 19:28.036
Honey, all I did was
kick doors open

19:28.079 --> 19:31.387
for you, and you chose to sit
on the porch like a child.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.041
Because I wasa child.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.130
We all have to live
with our choices.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.481
I disappoint you, don't I?
I embarrass you.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.657
-That's ridiculous.
-No, no, no. The great

19:40.701 --> 19:44.531
Susan Burgess has a daughter
who failed?

19:44.574 --> 19:46.315
Susan Burgess, the patron saint

19:46.359 --> 19:47.882
of modern motherhood
has a daughter

19:47.925 --> 19:50.189
who's a loser.
Well, you know what, Mom?

19:50.232 --> 19:52.191
You were a super shitty mom.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.671
-Keep your voice down.
-No. The books

19:54.715 --> 19:57.848
and the stories--
it's all bullshit, it's a scam.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.111
You're a big, fat phony.
You're a fraud.

20:00.155 --> 20:03.289
[laughs] That's funny,
you calling me a fraud.

20:03.332 --> 20:06.509
What's that supposed to mean?

20:06.553 --> 20:08.816
You don't think I did it?

20:08.859 --> 20:10.992
You don't think
I made up that quote?

20:11.035 --> 20:12.602
I wasn't embarrassed
that you lied

20:12.646 --> 20:14.256
or even that you got caught.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.736
Mom, I was set up!

20:15.779 --> 20:18.434
I was embarrassed
that you let it ruin you.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.003
Great talk.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.050
â™ª

20:28.836 --> 20:30.881
Okay, so,
here-here's the thing.

20:30.925 --> 20:34.929
Um, Beth and I--
we're-we're gonna work it out.

20:34.972 --> 20:38.759
Um, things are gonna
get back to normal.

20:38.802 --> 20:43.024
Um, she-she's promised
to recommit.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.113
Is that why you called?

20:46.070 --> 20:49.248
To tell me you're recommitting
with your wife?

20:49.291 --> 20:52.033
No, no. [sighs]

20:52.076 --> 20:54.601
Tessa, this is over.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.255
I... I'm sorry.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.039
I-I just thought that, you know,

20:58.082 --> 20:59.867
you deserved
an in-person explanation.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.347
Where is she, by the way?

21:01.390 --> 21:03.827
-Huh?
-Your wife.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.916
Where is she?

21:07.178 --> 21:10.791
Um, she-she's in California
for the night visiting her mom.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.228
Mm-hmm.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.752
You could've done this
on the phone.

21:15.796 --> 21:20.801
Instead, you invite me over,
at night,

21:20.844 --> 21:23.847
while your wife
is out of town.

21:23.891 --> 21:27.198
[Marco sighs]

21:27.242 --> 21:31.464
Hey, it's okay.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.030
It's okay.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.032
-Yeah?
-Yeah, it's okay.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.383
-Yeah.
-Come here. Mmm.

21:37.426 --> 21:40.168
[both sighing]

21:40.211 --> 21:42.388
[Tessa panting]

21:44.303 --> 21:46.522
Yeah. You got it?

21:46.566 --> 21:50.265
Yeah. [panting]

21:51.658 --> 21:54.487
My daughter is the prettiest
girl in the world!

21:54.530 --> 21:57.403
-[distant cackling]
-[laughs]

21:57.446 --> 22:00.188
Yo, it's true.
She takes after her mama.

22:00.231 --> 22:01.798
[laughs]

22:05.585 --> 22:08.762
[phone vibrating]

22:08.805 --> 22:10.372
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.896
Y'all be quiet now
with your ugly asses.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.159
I got bigness.

22:17.988 --> 22:22.253
Hey, B.
Hey, yo, listen, listen, listen.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.081
I can't get this story
out of my head.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.693
Like, I've just been dreaming
about it all day, you know?

22:26.736 --> 22:28.521
[laughs]
Thinking about what

22:28.564 --> 22:30.392
I'm gonna get Laila
when I'm out.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.656
Like, maybe, um, like, a doll
or, like, some clothes,

22:33.700 --> 22:37.138
or, like, uh, uh, uh, uh,
one of them big old

22:37.181 --> 22:39.488
stuffed giraffes, you know?
[laughs]

22:39.532 --> 22:43.840
But then I realized, I'm gonna
let her get whatever she wants.

22:43.884 --> 22:47.540
Anything. If she wants it,
she gets it, huh?

22:47.583 --> 22:50.064
[laughs]

22:50.107 --> 22:51.631
Hello?

22:51.674 --> 22:54.155
Beth?!

22:54.198 --> 22:56.549
I'm sorry.

22:56.592 --> 23:00.074
[laughing]:
What? Hey, what happened? What?

23:00.117 --> 23:02.990
I'm having a hard time
getting the story out there.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.426
Well, what do you mean?

23:04.470 --> 23:05.993
What do you mean?

23:06.036 --> 23:08.082
No one will run it.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.259
Amber, Ravi, my mom.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.130
So, Susan said "no"?

23:13.174 --> 23:14.697
I'm gonna figure it out.
I'm gonna

23:14.741 --> 23:17.396
post it online,
and somebody will pick it up.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.486
And I have a few
freelance contacts

23:20.529 --> 23:22.313
I can call tomorrow.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.533
So you're gonna do this
to me again?

23:24.577 --> 23:28.319
I can't believe
you're doing this to me again.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.539
No, no, no, no, Toni,
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fix it.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.802
Okay? I can fix this.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.804
No. No.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.893
No!

23:36.937 --> 23:38.329
[line beeps]

23:38.373 --> 23:40.462
Shit.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.073
Damn it.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.387
You're right. [sighs]

23:52.431 --> 23:54.694
This was a bad idea.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.958
-What?
-Look at you.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.568
You're acting all tense
and weird.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.222
-Again.
-No, no, I'm-I'm not.

24:01.265 --> 24:03.006
Okay, whatever.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.269
I'll see you later.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.837
-Are you serious?
-Uh-huh.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.449
I was the one
who was trying to break up

24:10.492 --> 24:12.189
with you earlier,
and you wouldn't let me.

24:12.233 --> 24:16.106
Marco, you've got to learn
to stand up for yourself.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.847
If you want something,
you just...

24:17.891 --> 24:19.370
you-you go out, and you get it.

24:19.414 --> 24:20.459
It's not that hard.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.461
-Haven't I been doing that?
-Uh-huh.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.116
Bye, hon. We had fun.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.597
Boop.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.254
You got a light out in here.
You should fix it.

24:33.297 --> 24:35.038
Fun?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.826
It's just up here
on your right.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.743
[sighs]

24:45.962 --> 24:48.008
â™ª

25:07.984 --> 25:11.988
Sir, could you keep driving,
please?

25:25.262 --> 25:27.438
[sighs]

25:45.282 --> 25:48.024
Did you hear?
I'm out in three weeks.

25:48.068 --> 25:51.550
Have fun dying in here, lifer.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.771
Only way out of here is
in a body bag.

26:15.225 --> 26:17.488
Hi.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.363
Hey, hey, hey.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.887
Hey, it's all right.

26:24.931 --> 26:27.455
Listen, everything's gonna
be all right.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.544
Okay?

26:48.128 --> 26:50.173
What you thinking about?

26:52.567 --> 26:54.656
Nothing.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.834
Do you feel bad
'cause you're married?

26:58.878 --> 27:01.141
[laughs]
No.

27:01.184 --> 27:04.187
No, it's not that.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.148
Well, then... [laughs]
What is it?

27:13.327 --> 27:16.025
Everything I have is gone.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.072
Do you know that feeling?

27:20.029 --> 27:22.989
Yeah, kind of.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.863
I thought
I had all these things,

27:27.907 --> 27:30.823
but it turns out,
I have nothing.

27:30.866 --> 27:33.042
It's all... it's all vanished.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.131
Just poof, just like that.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.308
And it's all my fault.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.310
Hey, hey, hey, no, man.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.661
That ranger dude had it coming.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
Can I tell you something?

27:53.759 --> 27:55.761
Anything.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.764
I used to work for
this newspaper, The Chronicle,

27:58.807 --> 28:00.896
and I was...
I was writing a story.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.421
Big tainted water scandal
over at Fort Collins.

28:04.465 --> 28:07.076
And... it was a good story.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.904
It was a really,
really good story.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.167
The only problem was,

28:11.211 --> 28:14.083
I knew who was responsible, but

28:14.127 --> 28:18.218
I couldn't get anybody
to go on the record.

28:18.261 --> 28:21.612
And Ravi-- my old boss--
he kept saying

28:21.656 --> 28:24.703
that without that final nail,
he wouldn't run it.

28:24.746 --> 28:28.358
So...

28:28.402 --> 28:30.709
I, um...

28:30.752 --> 28:33.015
I made up the quote.

28:34.016 --> 28:37.803
And I... I told myself
it was in the name of justice,

28:37.846 --> 28:42.372
and the-the good outweighed
the bad, but...

28:42.416 --> 28:45.245
that was bullshit.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.900
I did it for me.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.859
To win, to be right.

28:53.862 --> 28:57.083
But, George, I did it.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.346
All along, it was me.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.655
I'm a liar and a fraud.

29:06.266 --> 29:09.791
And-and I've...
I've ruined my life

29:09.835 --> 29:12.838
and everybody's life
that I care about.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.059
And I'm a piece of shit.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.368
TONI:
"Fear not,

29:21.411 --> 29:25.024
"for I have redeemed thee.

29:25.067 --> 29:29.115
"I have called thee
by thy name,

29:29.158 --> 29:31.900
"thou art mine.

29:31.944 --> 29:34.947
"When thou passest
through the waters,

29:34.990 --> 29:38.559
"I will be with thee;

29:38.602 --> 29:41.388
"and through the rivers,

29:41.431 --> 29:44.478
they shall not overflow thee."

29:55.271 --> 29:57.317
Thanks, Mom.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.580
I love you.

30:23.560 --> 30:29.088
"When thou walkest through the
fire, thou shalt not be burned,

30:29.131 --> 30:32.395
neither shall the flame kindle
upon thee."

30:45.887 --> 30:48.020
GEORGE:
Can I tell you something?

30:50.457 --> 30:52.546
Will it make me feel better?

31:06.516 --> 31:08.301
I killed Wallace.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.436
-What?
-It was me.

31:13.480 --> 31:16.048
I killed Wallace.

31:23.794 --> 31:26.493
Oh.

31:26.536 --> 31:30.236
Oh, that feels so good to say.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.811
TONI:
"For I am the Lord thy God,

31:40.855 --> 31:44.598
"the Holy One of Israel,

31:44.641 --> 31:46.992
thy Savior."

31:49.255 --> 31:50.952
[distorted shouting]

31:50.996 --> 31:52.562
â™ª

31:57.611 --> 31:59.221
[distorted screaming]

32:03.225 --> 32:09.101
"Since thou wast precious
in my sight...

32:09.144 --> 32:10.363
I have loved thee."
