WEBVTT

01:32.968 --> 01:35.703
Hey, all you Shark Week
fans out there.

01:35.769 --> 01:40.374
Welcome back, it's our third
summer here at Little Happy

01:40.441 --> 01:44.079
an abandoned fishing village
in the Mozambique Channel.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.480
The residents were some of the
first victims

01:46.547 --> 01:48.616
of rising sea levels.

01:48.682 --> 01:52.020
800 people used to live
on this tiny manmade island.

01:53.621 --> 01:55.223
Now there are only two left.

01:55.290 --> 01:58.525
And in case you were thinking
this is someone else's life

01:58.592 --> 02:02.831
this... is what the Florida Keys
will look like.

02:02.898 --> 02:06.801
And Houston, and New Orleans.

02:08.203 --> 02:12.340
But... there's another side
to Little Happy.

02:12.406 --> 02:14.809
The nursery... out there.

02:17.645 --> 02:21.049
Alright. You wanna see?
Let's go.

02:29.623 --> 02:31.525
The fish drew the fishermen

02:31.592 --> 02:33.594
who built this village
on a coral reef

02:33.661 --> 02:35.931
right next to this nursery.

02:40.768 --> 02:42.804
It's home to
one of the most biodiverse

02:42.871 --> 02:45.539
ecosystems on the planet.

02:52.180 --> 02:55.716
Here in Little Happy,
my team and I

02:55.784 --> 02:58.787
are creating a database
called the Triton

02:58.853 --> 03:03.992
which uses sonar and AI
to identify and study organisms

03:04.059 --> 03:07.228
in a targeted area,
like this canyon..

03:08.330 --> 03:09.998
...from great white sharks

03:10.065 --> 03:13.101
to fishes
small as a centimeter long.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.123
Sharks return here
each year to feed

03:35.190 --> 03:37.658
mate and give birth.

03:40.627 --> 03:43.331
Their home, like ours,
is under attack

03:43.398 --> 03:47.568
from climate change.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.445
Carbon emissions
are absorbed by the ocean

03:57.511 --> 03:59.214
more and more every year

03:59.280 --> 04:01.648
resulting in warmer
water temperatures

04:01.715 --> 04:04.185
rising sea levels,
food source loss

04:04.252 --> 04:08.323
ocean acidification
and species extinction.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.664
- You okay, Shaw?
- A lot of sharks.

04:17.731 --> 04:19.434
Let's go.

04:19.500 --> 04:23.838
My father, Nick Collins,
believed that studying sharks

04:23.905 --> 04:27.208
like us, apex predators
at the top of the food chain

04:27.275 --> 04:29.878
helps us understand
and improve the health

04:29.944 --> 04:31.880
of entire ecosystems.

04:31.946 --> 04:34.615
If sharks are in trouble,
we are, too.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.585
Emma.

04:40.255 --> 04:42.424
No. Back off, Shaw.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.059
Stop.

04:47.561 --> 04:49.696
I want you to meet Sally.

04:51.299 --> 04:53.767
She's the great white
who led us to this nursery

04:53.835 --> 04:56.371
after we tagged her.

04:56.438 --> 04:59.174
We've been studying
how she and her neighbors

04:59.240 --> 05:02.811
are adapting to climate change
in real time.

05:02.877 --> 05:04.846
'Are you out of your mind?'

05:06.481 --> 05:08.917
If you stay calm and redirect..

05:08.983 --> 05:13.754
...Sally's just
reminding me who I am.

05:13.822 --> 05:17.459
And who she is.
Don't try this at home.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.428
'Emma!'

05:22.430 --> 05:23.465
Damn it!

05:23.531 --> 05:26.101
- 'Ah.'
- 'Emma!'

05:28.870 --> 05:31.973
Emma. Fuck! Let me look.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.976
- It's okay. I'm okay, Shaw.
- Give me your arm.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.078
- Give me your arm.
- I'm okay.

05:37.145 --> 05:39.581
You're bleeding,
you're not alright.

05:39.646 --> 05:42.984
- 'There's blood in the water.'
- 'Fuck.'

05:43.051 --> 05:44.651
Oh, God.

05:44.718 --> 05:46.720
Come on, let's get back.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.286
That was amazing.

06:18.353 --> 06:21.688
Ah, you can learn more about
our research on our website.

06:21.755 --> 06:23.491
All charitable contributions
go to

06:23.558 --> 06:25.560
the Nick Collins Fin Foundation.

06:25.627 --> 06:29.230
I'm Dr. Emma Collins,
and that's Shaw

06:29.297 --> 06:32.000
and we are... Waterblog.

06:33.468 --> 06:37.906
- That shark wasn't playing.
- Sally? We're old friends.

06:37.972 --> 06:40.041
Healthy respect, remember?

06:40.108 --> 06:42.377
Sounds like something
my dad would've said.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.445
You're right.

06:44.512 --> 06:46.848
Emma, I just want you
to be a little safer

06:46.915 --> 06:48.049
it's all I'm saying.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.451
Listen, Shaw,
I know my dad was your CO

06:50.518 --> 06:51.819
and you feel like you owe him

06:51.886 --> 06:55.390
but I'm way too old
for parenting advice, alright?

06:55.456 --> 06:58.059
But I love you.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.862
I need a beer.
You coming?

07:04.332 --> 07:07.268
- Yeah, you're good.
- I make it look good.

07:07.335 --> 07:08.469
Aw.

07:28.890 --> 07:32.093
It's her. It's Bella.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.196
Looks like the nets
did our jobs for us.

07:35.263 --> 07:37.532
We gotta catch
the other three, Lucas.

07:37.599 --> 07:40.835
- There's no time left.
- How are we gonna do that?

07:40.902 --> 07:43.037
You're the shark expert,
and if we can't

07:43.104 --> 07:45.739
track their mum anymore,
it's over.

07:45.807 --> 07:47.442
Bella was a good mother.

07:50.278 --> 07:52.714
She was taking her kids to
the best all-you-can-eat buffet

07:52.780 --> 07:54.282
in town.

07:57.151 --> 08:00.788
<i>♪ Wey yo wey yo ♪</i>

08:00.855 --> 08:03.057
Yo.

08:03.124 --> 08:05.927
<i>♪ Wey yo wey yo ♪</i>

08:05.994 --> 08:08.796
- Spin.
- That was awesome.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.500
And the underwater live feed?
That was great too, check it.

08:12.567 --> 08:15.103
She's the great white
who led us to this nursery after we..

08:15.169 --> 08:17.372
It's gonna get
like 5000 likes easy.

08:17.438 --> 08:19.274
I'm gonna get it up on
Facebook and Insta by tonight.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.075
- What's up with the drone?
- Right.

08:21.142 --> 08:24.512
So, uh, one of the servos
is burnt out, but I-I'm on it.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.650
Miya.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.587
- Are you-are you okay?
- Anything new on the Triton?

08:32.654 --> 08:34.889
Um, yeah. Um..

08:34.956 --> 08:36.791
I still can't find him.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.928
- Who?
- Nemo.

08:44.164 --> 08:46.167
You want a rec
for a decent PhD program

08:46.234 --> 08:48.369
you better try harder than that.

08:52.206 --> 08:55.677
- What?
- No problem, Dr. Collins.

08:55.743 --> 08:59.113
- So what do you got?
- So..

08:59.180 --> 09:03.484
I finished the population
survey... and you're right.

09:03.551 --> 09:08.289
The great whites has declined
from last year, 6%.

09:08.356 --> 09:10.858
- Adults or pups?
- Both.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.829
Surprised, Dr. Collins?

09:22.537 --> 09:25.340
Nah, it can't be right.
Must be a glitch.

09:25.406 --> 09:27.909
Hey, Spin, how's our coverage
on the Triton?

09:27.975 --> 09:30.878
Uh, right now we're
at 65% of the nursery

09:30.945 --> 09:33.081
which should give us
pretty decent numbers.

09:33.147 --> 09:35.683
That's not good enough, Spin.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.319
Let's take care of some
of our blind spots, alright?

09:38.386 --> 09:41.422
We'll outfit another...
half dozen sensors.

09:41.489 --> 09:44.859
- On it.
- We'll set 'em up tomorrow.

09:57.372 --> 10:00.274
♪ Mmm ♪

10:22.063 --> 10:23.297
That's a nice catch.

10:23.364 --> 10:24.932
We could've made good money
with these

10:24.999 --> 10:26.234
at the restaurant, Nandi.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.703
I know, seems like a while ago.

10:28.770 --> 10:31.172
Uh-huh.

10:31.239 --> 10:34.375
Bahari, this is no way
to live. We should leave.

10:34.442 --> 10:36.812
This is the only home
we've ever known, Nandi.

10:36.879 --> 10:39.714
It's gone.
Look around.

10:39.782 --> 10:41.115
There's nothing here for us.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.384
- Where would we go, huh?
- Anywhere.

10:43.451 --> 10:44.585
We'll figure it out.

10:48.891 --> 10:52.260
Oh, boy.
I know that look.

10:52.326 --> 10:54.328
Mama had the same one.

10:55.763 --> 10:59.835
Ah, Look, Nandi,
could we talk about this later?

10:59.902 --> 11:03.404
t's always later
with you, Bahari.

11:03.471 --> 11:05.973
But it's okay.
So, go clean up.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.752
This was delicious, Nandi.
Thank you.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.220
Our pleasure.

11:20.856 --> 11:23.257
- Spin?
- Hmm?

11:23.324 --> 11:27.728
Spin,
why don't you eat fish, huh?

11:29.363 --> 11:32.133
Spin's a paleo vegan,
a pegan.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.435
Bahari, responsible
and sustainable food choices

11:34.502 --> 11:36.037
are not only good
for the environment

11:36.103 --> 11:37.305
they're good for your health,
too, so..

11:37.371 --> 11:40.876
They are fish.
Save your speech, ah?

11:40.943 --> 11:45.046
The world is full of speeches
and look where that's got us.

11:45.112 --> 11:47.715
On that, we agree. Shots?

11:47.783 --> 11:49.016
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

11:49.083 --> 11:51.854
- Yeah.
- May I, Dr. Collins?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.055
Listen, Miya,
we're drinking together,

11:54.121 --> 11:57.024
you can call me Emma.
Go ahead.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.993
Hmm.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.830
- Oh.
- You are so sexy.

12:03.197 --> 12:05.166
Did I, did I just say that
out loud?

12:05.233 --> 12:06.567
Oh, okay.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.402
You know, we all know
about you two.

12:08.469 --> 12:11.940
Okay, so,
we have customs for drinking

12:12.006 --> 12:16.778
in Japan, and it is considered
polite to pour for others.

12:16.845 --> 12:18.613
And the young...

12:22.683 --> 12:24.051
pour for the old.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.554
- 'Oh, damn.'
- Me! What about him?

12:27.688 --> 12:30.124
I'm your superior,
that's not cool.

12:30.191 --> 12:31.894
- Here.
- Thank you.

12:34.328 --> 12:37.131
- Kampai!
- Kampai!

13:01.255 --> 13:03.190
That's not enough, you know.

13:12.733 --> 13:15.069
'Supplies
aren't due for a week.'

13:15.136 --> 13:17.338
Yeah, and it's not
the trash barge.

13:23.812 --> 13:26.014
'Have you seen
that boat before?'

13:26.080 --> 13:29.584
Hmm... no.

13:31.719 --> 13:34.255
Who knows? They might have
some clothes on there.

13:34.322 --> 13:36.959
Get a shirt that fits you.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.359
'Let's go check it out.'

13:39.962 --> 13:42.697
Emma.
I can't believe it.

13:42.763 --> 13:46.400
- Who's the hot guy?
- Richie Lowell.

13:46.467 --> 13:48.003
They went to grad school
together.

13:48.070 --> 13:50.738
Wait, together or...
like together?

13:50.806 --> 13:55.209
- Richard?
- Hey. How you doing?

13:55.276 --> 13:58.479
Oh. Together.

13:58.546 --> 14:02.483
Wow. I haven't seen you
in forever.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.785
Yeah.

14:05.486 --> 14:07.321
What are you doing here?

14:07.388 --> 14:09.223
We need your help.

14:11.292 --> 14:13.895
Guys? This is Richard
and Lucas.

14:13.962 --> 14:16.932
This is Spin,
he's our MIT tech wizard.

14:16.999 --> 14:19.467
- Uh, Shaw. You remember Shaw.
- Good to see you, Shaw.

14:19.533 --> 14:21.135
Good to see you too, Richie.

14:21.202 --> 14:23.571
Uh, it's Richard,
or Dr. Lowell now.

14:23.638 --> 14:25.706
- Your call, Eugene.
- And this is Miya.

14:25.773 --> 14:27.943
She's, um,
one of our summer students

14:28.010 --> 14:29.744
'on loan
from the Toba Institute'

14:29.811 --> 14:32.014
'of Maritime Technology.
Did I get that right?'

14:32.080 --> 14:33.314
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

14:36.684 --> 14:38.653
- Very nice to meet you, Miya.
- Nice to meet you.

14:38.719 --> 14:40.856
'These boys need a
little help from our Triton.'

14:40.922 --> 14:44.358
- What are you looking to find?
- Three bulls.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.660
It's a bad neighborhood
for bulls

14:45.726 --> 14:47.428
they'd be like sushi
to the whites.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.764
- 'Lucas?'
- Usually that'd be the case.

14:49.831 --> 14:51.565
We got a tracker in one.

14:51.632 --> 14:53.802
We're sure that
they were headed this way.

14:53.869 --> 14:56.270
A half dozen people went missing
about 100 miles

14:56.337 --> 14:57.839
up the Orange River.

14:57.906 --> 15:00.842
At first, the locals
thought it was crocs.

15:00.909 --> 15:02.643
- Turns out it was bull sharks.
- 'What?'

15:02.710 --> 15:04.578
But Sharks don't
exhibit that kind of behavior

15:04.645 --> 15:07.548
unless they're stressed
or hungry, you know that.

15:07.615 --> 15:11.185
Exactly, we were hired
to stop them

15:11.252 --> 15:12.486
and to find out what's wrong.

15:12.553 --> 15:15.389
Wait, so they kill people
on a river.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.093
Bull sharks can survive
in freshwater.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.494
Yeah, I picked
right up on that.

15:20.561 --> 15:24.699
They work together...
or they hunted in a pack.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.569
That's not possible.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.372
- Together like dolphins?
- That's right.

15:31.439 --> 15:33.041
I've seen it myself.

15:33.108 --> 15:35.376
I find this really
hard to believe.

15:36.744 --> 15:38.814
Okay. Miya..

15:40.414 --> 15:42.550
You got anything
on the Triton?

15:42.616 --> 15:46.620
Yeah. So..

15:46.687 --> 15:49.825
...it's been at least a week
since I've seen

15:49.891 --> 15:52.326
any carcharhinus leucas.

15:52.393 --> 15:54.662
- 'A few dozen great whites.'
- No bulls?

15:54.729 --> 15:56.731
'Nope. Mm-mm.'

15:58.499 --> 16:00.501
There you have it.

16:00.568 --> 16:03.704
I guess that's goodbye
and... good luck?

16:05.406 --> 16:07.508
It just looks like Waterblog.

16:07.575 --> 16:10.812
- You follow us?
- What do you think?

16:10.879 --> 16:16.118
Yeah, it's a weird place
to call home, Em. It's grim.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.319
Up here, yeah.

16:18.385 --> 16:21.422
Down there, it's, um,
it's heaven.

16:21.489 --> 16:25.359
Just you and the fish?
The way you like it?

16:25.426 --> 16:28.395
No sign of humanity around?

16:28.462 --> 16:32.901
I mean, who can blame you?
Look what we've done.

16:32.968 --> 16:36.270
Hey, why is a double PhD
in shark neurology

16:36.337 --> 16:37.671
out hunting sharks?

16:42.276 --> 16:45.847
Why don't you come aboard
for a drink and I'll tell you?

16:49.483 --> 16:51.318
Welcome aboard.

16:52.854 --> 16:55.289
You've come down
in the world, Richard.

16:55.356 --> 16:56.624
This thing can float?

16:56.690 --> 16:58.894
My employer likes to keep
a low profile.

17:01.029 --> 17:04.232
We're gonna look around,
see if we can locate our bulls.

17:04.298 --> 17:06.634
- 'Hey, Brown.'
- 'What's up, boss?'

17:08.804 --> 17:12.174
- 'Uh, whiskey?'
- 'I'm diving.'

17:12.240 --> 17:14.776
- 'I bet you are, too.'
- 'Water it is.'

17:23.218 --> 17:25.653
'That's cool.'

17:25.719 --> 17:27.755
Yeah.

17:27.823 --> 17:29.723
Hey, you ever think about us?

17:31.893 --> 17:33.661
Sure, sometimes.

17:35.230 --> 17:37.132
What do you think about?

17:37.199 --> 17:38.599
That it sucked
that my dad died

17:38.666 --> 17:40.501
and you took that job in Sydney.

17:42.536 --> 17:44.672
But we're probably
exactly where we should be.

17:46.007 --> 17:47.675
Probably.

17:52.180 --> 17:55.250
- Bella.
- Yeah.

17:55.317 --> 17:57.551
- Is that the shark you tracked?
- Yeah.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.487
I found her yesterday. Deceased.

18:00.554 --> 18:01.990
Just trying to figure out
if I can learn

18:02.057 --> 18:04.226
anything from her brain.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.727
- Did you?
- Unfortunately not.

18:06.795 --> 18:11.498
- Light's still on.
- Oh. Here.

18:11.565 --> 18:14.102
So, who's paying?

18:14.169 --> 18:15.904
- Genotics Labs.
- Oh.

18:15.971 --> 18:18.706
I know, I know,
the corporate overlords.

18:18.772 --> 18:21.542
I do a few projects for them,
they fund my research.

18:21.609 --> 18:23.611
So you're working
for Big Pharma.

18:23.677 --> 18:27.883
Let's face it, climate change
is here to stay, Emma.

18:27.949 --> 18:29.750
World's gonna get
a whole lot smaller.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.853
And make some people
a lot of money.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.755
- Sistine Chapel didn't...
- Didn't pay for itself.

18:38.927 --> 18:42.763
Hey, um, listen..

18:42.831 --> 18:46.134
Just stay out of the water
until we've done our work.

18:46.201 --> 18:48.870
Okay? Just as a precaution.

18:48.937 --> 18:51.772
Well, thank you,
but we're working here, too.

18:53.707 --> 18:57.544
- Same old Emma.
- Same old Richard.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.284
- Can I check it out?
- Sure, knock yourself out.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.253
Just, uh, don't touch anything
that looks expensive, okay?

19:05.320 --> 19:07.521
Okay.

19:13.161 --> 19:15.629
Let's get it.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.033
- Hey, bro. You ready?
- Hey, boss man. Oh, yeah.

19:18.099 --> 19:20.302
Take care of yourself
down there.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.070
Here you go.

19:22.137 --> 19:24.272
'Alright, Brown's leading
the way and he's going the deepest.'

19:24.339 --> 19:28.209
'Make sure you got his back,
so he can go down further.'

19:28.276 --> 19:30.779
- Move in about 30 yards.
- Copy that, sir.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.419
Miya, com check.

19:37.484 --> 19:40.454
'I hear you loud and
clear, Dr. Collins.'

19:48.196 --> 19:51.166
- Going deeper.
- 'Careful.'

19:51.232 --> 19:53.667
'There are sharks around you.'

20:02.177 --> 20:07.115
Okay, you are closing in
on one of our blind spots now.

20:07.182 --> 20:09.417
Copy that, Miya.

20:09.483 --> 20:12.053
Headed for the nursery wall.

20:29.070 --> 20:31.538
'Okay, team, how's it looking?'

20:31.605 --> 20:35.276
There's a lot of
black tips out here, no bulls.

20:37.979 --> 20:41.249
'I think we're
gonna have to go deeper.'

20:48.490 --> 20:51.292
Activating the sensor now, Miya.

20:53.627 --> 20:57.232
Good for frequency and data.
Next.

21:04.406 --> 21:07.942
'Okay, Brown, you go
deep, stay parallel with us.'

21:08.009 --> 21:10.378
- Copy.
- You boys be safe.

21:19.586 --> 21:21.790
'Okay, let's split up.'

21:21.856 --> 21:22.991
Roger that, boss.

21:23.058 --> 21:26.061
- Copy.
- 'Happy hunting.'

22:07.368 --> 22:10.737
I'm headed for
the next blind spot.

22:10.805 --> 22:13.308
'Got you, Dr. Collins.'

22:23.852 --> 22:25.686
We got a problem.

22:29.224 --> 22:33.627
- Emma, what's wrong?
- Fuck.

22:33.694 --> 22:36.097
I've got two large
great whites down here.

22:36.164 --> 22:37.899
Fresh kills.

22:42.303 --> 22:44.771
I thought I told you
to stay out of the water.

22:44.839 --> 22:46.307
- Richard...
- Emma...

22:46.374 --> 22:47.475
Richard, there's two down there!

22:47.542 --> 22:48.943
Calm down.

22:49.010 --> 22:50.812
There's two
dead sharks down there!

22:50.879 --> 22:55.016
I know, I know. Yeah, yeah.
But you have to calm down.

22:57.552 --> 23:01.923
Emma, there is a bull in the
field, it's big. Moving fast.

23:01.990 --> 23:05.493
- Richard, bull shark.
- What?

23:05.560 --> 23:07.195
Get out the nursery now!

23:07.262 --> 23:09.264
It's in a vector
towards one of their divers.

23:09.330 --> 23:11.933
Lucas,
they've got a bull shark in the nursery

23:12.000 --> 23:13.501
coming our way, copy.

23:13.568 --> 23:17.238
'Our lucky day, boys.
Watch your six.'

23:17.305 --> 23:20.041
Got you, boss,
our eyes are peeled.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.976
Come on, you sneaky fucks.

23:24.145 --> 23:27.248
'Brown, where are you?'

23:27.315 --> 23:29.750
Rising southwest,
depth, 90 feet.

23:33.888 --> 23:36.457
'Brown, do you read me?'

23:40.228 --> 23:42.397
- Brown.
- There he is. I see him.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.533
It's okay. Yeah, we see him.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.268
Okay.

23:54.776 --> 23:56.811
Shit!

24:05.253 --> 24:07.488
Come on, come on!

24:11.526 --> 24:13.895
I should get back to my team.

24:13.962 --> 24:16.297
Those great whites down there

24:16.364 --> 24:18.233
your bulls did that too?

24:18.299 --> 24:19.500
Yeah.

24:19.567 --> 24:21.903
Those sharks aren't
acting like sharks, Richard.

24:21.970 --> 24:23.504
They prey on
great white nurseries

24:23.571 --> 24:25.006
as a reliable food supply.

24:25.073 --> 24:26.641
Why didn't you tell us that
to begin with, man?

24:26.708 --> 24:28.443
Great whites are faster
and stronger

24:28.509 --> 24:29.877
they eat bull sharks for lunch.

24:29.944 --> 24:31.946
Not these. My theory is
that they're adapting

24:32.013 --> 24:34.349
to climate change faster
than the whites

24:34.415 --> 24:37.151
which is making them highly
aggressive towards everything.

24:37.218 --> 24:39.554
I was hired to perform
a neurological evaluation.

24:39.621 --> 24:41.089
So Genotics can make
money off them?

24:41.155 --> 24:43.858
Oh, you know, Emma,
I just lost a man down there.

24:47.262 --> 24:49.464
So what do we do?

24:49.530 --> 24:54.235
We don't get those sharks
out of the water now,

24:54.302 --> 24:57.605
they'll destroy everything
we're working to save.

25:05.013 --> 25:08.082
Most spooky thing
I've ever seen in my life.

25:08.149 --> 25:10.585
The way Brown was driving
that ACV

25:10.652 --> 25:12.520
like he didn't even know
he was dead.

25:12.587 --> 25:14.422
It could be ten miles
before his batteries died

25:14.489 --> 25:18.660
think about it. It could be
any one of us. You, me.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.029
Not me.

25:21.095 --> 25:23.298
I knew Brown for 15 years

25:23.364 --> 25:26.034
had my back more times
than I can count.

25:26.100 --> 25:29.003
And so if you have
to talk about him..

25:29.070 --> 25:30.805
...show some respect.

25:33.975 --> 25:35.810
Gear up, we're wet in 30.

25:35.877 --> 25:37.078
- Copy that.
- Okay.

25:39.681 --> 25:42.016
Emma, are you seriously
gonna help them out?

25:43.251 --> 25:45.553
We are.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.256
We just lost a human being.

25:48.323 --> 25:50.825
And at least two mature
great whites

25:50.892 --> 25:52.894
'we can't afford
to lose any more.'

25:54.362 --> 25:56.964
I know you and
Richard were close...

25:57.031 --> 25:58.833
And I know you and Dad
never liked him.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.102
Who gives a shit if I like him?

26:01.169 --> 26:04.172
I don't trust him.
Do you?

26:07.776 --> 26:09.844
- Spin.
- Yeah?

26:09.911 --> 26:13.514
Can you do a search history
on a GPS tracking signal?

26:13.581 --> 26:16.451
Uh, well, it depends
which kind of tracker.

26:16.517 --> 26:18.553
Well, the bull
in Richard's lab, Bella

26:18.619 --> 26:20.722
it was tagged with
an acoustic-to-radio

26:20.789 --> 26:22.256
conversion beacon.

26:22.323 --> 26:24.492
Wow, th-that's a really
tricky piece of tech.

26:24.559 --> 26:29.964
But you can run a search
history on... any GPS beacon.

26:30.031 --> 26:32.367
- Uh...
- Can't you, Spin?

26:32.433 --> 26:35.403
Yeah. 'Course I can...
I mean, I can try.

26:35.470 --> 26:39.607
- You can more than try.
- Right, I... I'll do that.

26:44.412 --> 26:46.614
You ever heard of knocking,
boys?

26:47.982 --> 26:50.451
We got a plan. Lucas?

26:50.518 --> 26:53.154
Folks, we think it's best
to deploy a sub drone

26:53.221 --> 26:56.391
that mimics the movements and
the electrical field of a seal.

26:56.457 --> 26:58.192
It will also chum out
seal blood.

26:58.259 --> 27:02.563
- Sharks like seals.
- Thank you for that.

27:02.630 --> 27:04.999
Look, we'll station ourselves
in your nursery,

27:05.066 --> 27:09.470
and we'll use your Triton system
as our spotter.

27:09.537 --> 27:11.706
And hopefully you'll warn us,
yeah?

27:15.309 --> 27:17.211
Great. We'll get a man in here

27:17.278 --> 27:19.113
and you can show me
how this system works.

27:20.548 --> 27:22.183
Thank you.

27:23.651 --> 27:26.354
Thank you for bringing
a big strong man in here

27:26.421 --> 27:29.123
because this little girl
with a degree

27:29.190 --> 27:31.292
in environmental acoustic
propulsion engineering

27:31.359 --> 27:34.362
couldn't possibly handle it.

27:34.429 --> 27:36.631
No offense, Emma, but sometimes

27:36.697 --> 27:39.667
a big strong man
just wants to help.

27:39.734 --> 27:41.269
And she is just a kid.

27:48.276 --> 27:51.345
- What you got there, fellas?
- Haloperidol cocktails.

27:51.412 --> 27:53.681
Yeah, we'd prefer to take
our bulls alive.

27:53.748 --> 27:58.619
Yeah, we've-we've got those too.
But what are those?

27:58.686 --> 28:03.424
Explosive tipped. For when
we don't want them alive.

28:03.491 --> 28:05.092
But this whole place
is falling apart.

28:05.159 --> 28:06.727
One of those things
hits a piling

28:06.795 --> 28:08.563
what's left of this village
goes under.

28:08.629 --> 28:12.300
There's nothing to worry about,
my men don't miss.

28:12.366 --> 28:13.869
I wanna know
when your shark problem

28:13.936 --> 28:15.136
became our shark problem.

28:15.203 --> 28:16.839
Because we're all in this
together.

28:16.905 --> 28:19.207
Well, kumba-fucking-ya, Richie.

28:21.108 --> 28:23.978
Em. I mean, you can't
expect me to put my men

28:24.045 --> 28:26.047
in the water
without defending themselves.

28:30.418 --> 28:32.788
Spin, give him access
to our com system.

28:32.855 --> 28:35.423
Got it.

28:35.490 --> 28:38.459
And Miya, you see a bull,
you let everyone know, okay?

28:38.526 --> 28:40.796
On it.

28:40.863 --> 28:44.165
Emma. Thank you.

29:47.194 --> 29:50.866
A great white.
Look at this.

29:50.933 --> 29:52.868
'Keep watching your
back, these things move fast.'

29:52.935 --> 29:54.903
Sally's keeping to
the sea floor.

29:54.970 --> 29:57.138
That's really weird because
they've been chumming out

29:57.204 --> 29:59.007
seal blood like crazy.

29:59.073 --> 30:01.043
Maybe they are scared.

30:14.322 --> 30:16.058
I'll get the blood
going when you're ready.

30:16.123 --> 30:17.993
Roger that.

30:32.773 --> 30:36.611
- Just give me the word, Lucas.
- 'Copy that.'

30:54.428 --> 30:56.064
Can I ask you a question, Emma?

30:56.130 --> 30:58.265
'Yeah, what?'

31:01.003 --> 31:05.172
Oh, no. We're doing
the girl talk thing, aren't we?

31:06.741 --> 31:09.510
I like Spin.

31:09.577 --> 31:13.915
I mean... I really like him.

31:13.982 --> 31:15.784
Yeah, he's a sweet guy.

31:19.855 --> 31:21.455
Okay.

31:24.225 --> 31:28.529
Let's see where you've been,
Thasos.

31:28.596 --> 31:31.465
If you're happy, go for it.

31:31.532 --> 31:35.469
Okay, wait,
that's all you got for me?

31:35.536 --> 31:38.807
- "Don't worry, be happy"?
- Yeah.

31:38.874 --> 31:43.078
Hey, I'm... good with fish,
bad with people.

31:45.981 --> 31:47.548
Yeah, oh, yeah,
you think that's funny?

31:47.615 --> 31:50.584
- Maybe.
- Okay, great.

31:54.455 --> 31:57.591
Ready to send
the drone back to your way.

31:57.658 --> 31:59.727
'Roger that.'

32:13.708 --> 32:15.443
Oh, shit.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.524
- Bull shark!
- Okay.

32:30.591 --> 32:32.326
Miya's got word,
incoming bull.

32:32.393 --> 32:36.397
175 degrees southwest,
depth 18 and dropping.

32:36.464 --> 32:38.499
It's heading toward
your team, Dr. Lowell.

32:38.566 --> 32:40.334
Got a sighting
on one of the sharks.

32:40.401 --> 32:41.937
Got you, sir, copy.

32:44.605 --> 32:47.708
It turned away,
it's in the cove.

32:47.776 --> 32:49.744
I'm close to that position.

32:49.811 --> 32:53.714
'Richard,
it's too risky, wait for us.'

32:53.782 --> 32:55.616
No, Lucas, stay there,
I'll bring this one

32:55.683 --> 32:57.384
back to the nursery,
you can take it.

32:57.451 --> 32:59.653
'I'll say again, wait for us.'

33:04.425 --> 33:06.128
- Keep talking to him.
- Okay.

33:06.194 --> 33:08.797
Watch out,
it's still in the cove.

33:11.967 --> 33:15.503
'Richard, that bull is off our
grid, you won't see it coming.'

33:25.679 --> 33:28.984
Richard, don't go in the cove,
it's not safe there

33:29.050 --> 33:30.718
we can't see you on the Triton.

33:30.786 --> 33:33.621
I'm okay. Just keep your eyes
peeled for the other two.

33:38.894 --> 33:41.595
'Richard! Shark! Bull shark!'

33:46.168 --> 33:49.503
- Richard? Richard!
- Shit!

33:51.807 --> 33:53.909
Whoa!

33:57.279 --> 34:00.248
- Richard!
- Emma!

34:40.621 --> 34:44.793
- Quick! Out of the water!
- Grab his legs, grab his legs.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.665
- You okay?
- Lucas.

34:51.732 --> 34:53.034
Get the shark out of the water

34:53.101 --> 34:55.469
get him on the boat
and get it sedated.

34:55.536 --> 34:57.005
- Alright.

34:57.072 --> 34:59.140
- I'm gonna take this off.
- Okay, yeah.

34:59.207 --> 35:00.741
Opening your buckles.

35:20.761 --> 35:22.864
Yeah, yeah, go. Go.

35:25.333 --> 35:27.701
Okay.

35:27.768 --> 35:30.839
Well,
mesh weaving was worth every penny.

35:30.906 --> 35:34.309
Well, good thing the shark
was sleeping when it bit you.

35:34.376 --> 35:37.478
Very funny.

35:37.544 --> 35:40.015
I mean, look on the bright side,
right?

35:40.081 --> 35:42.050
You'll never have to pay
for another drink

35:42.117 --> 35:44.853
for the rest of your life.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.922
What, you'd buy me a drink?

35:49.991 --> 35:51.759
Maybe.

35:51.826 --> 35:53.828
Oh, would you listen to me
tell you the story

35:53.895 --> 35:58.800
about the time a young bull
almost bit me in half?

35:58.867 --> 36:01.002
But I fought him off
all by myself.

36:01.069 --> 36:03.371
- Uh-uh.
- And then I pried myself free.

36:03.437 --> 36:08.109
Tooth by tooth by tooth,
I was very brave.

36:08.176 --> 36:10.111
Yeah, I'd buy you that drink.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.683
But I wouldn't believe
a word you said.

36:18.887 --> 36:21.722
And one of your men
did just get bit in half.

36:28.129 --> 36:30.231
Thanks for saving my life
out there.

36:33.134 --> 36:35.602
You would've done the same.

36:39.573 --> 36:42.476
I should get back to my boat.

36:42.543 --> 36:44.678
I wanna see that shark.

36:55.457 --> 36:58.159
Oh.

36:58.226 --> 36:59.626
Yeah.

36:59.693 --> 37:02.364
Yeah, yeah.

37:05.532 --> 37:07.634
Yeah.

37:07.701 --> 37:09.703
Snagged.

37:29.024 --> 37:31.793
No, no, no,
not my lucky hook.

38:06.227 --> 38:08.263
Wow, it's beautiful.

38:10.597 --> 38:14.135
It's a juvenile.
How old do we think it is?

38:14.202 --> 38:19.040
Ah, three to four years at
most, I'm guessing.

38:19.107 --> 38:22.510
Looks older.

38:22.576 --> 38:24.711
Nearly mature.

38:27.449 --> 38:28.917
What happened to you?

38:28.983 --> 38:31.352
How much Haloperidol
did you pump into her?

38:31.419 --> 38:33.587
I gotta put an IV line in.

38:33.654 --> 38:37.658
30 ccs.
But I think she's a he.

38:37.724 --> 38:40.195
Nah. Nope, no way.

38:43.531 --> 38:47.734
Wow, yeah, no mistaking
those claspers for a cloaca.

38:47.802 --> 38:49.770
How unprofessional of me.

38:49.838 --> 38:54.342
Okay, get him oxygenated,
get a sedative line in.

38:54.409 --> 38:56.077
And watch his vitals, okay?

38:56.144 --> 38:58.913
- Yes, sir.
- 'Good job.'

39:00.982 --> 39:02.616
I'll go with you tomorrow.

39:02.683 --> 39:03.918
I'll help you catch
the other two.

39:03.985 --> 39:05.887
No, you don't have
to do that, Emma.

39:05.954 --> 39:08.089
I'm not asking,
I'm telling.

39:08.156 --> 39:10.959
If you got man-eaters out there,
we both need to find out why.

39:25.772 --> 39:27.475
'Bahari!'

39:29.377 --> 39:31.179
Wait, Nandi!

39:34.616 --> 39:36.050
Bahari!

39:37.485 --> 39:39.420
Nandi! Don't go in the water,
don't go in the water!

39:39.487 --> 39:41.489
Don't go in the water,
don't go in the water.

39:44.159 --> 39:45.726
Shaw!

40:08.383 --> 40:13.521
'It's okay, Shaw, I got it.'

40:13.588 --> 40:15.456
'Nandi?'

40:24.632 --> 40:26.334
'Oh, my God.'

40:59.033 --> 41:01.735
There's still two more out there
and we need to find them..

41:01.803 --> 41:03.972
whether your girlfriend
helps us or not.

41:04.038 --> 41:06.507
You do your job,
I'll do mine.

41:08.142 --> 41:10.578
Well, you're the one
who knows Collins.

41:10.645 --> 41:12.647
What do you think she'll do?

41:12.714 --> 41:14.983
That's none of your concern.

41:18.386 --> 41:20.188
Yet.

41:25.026 --> 41:29.163
Spin?
Before, did you find anything?

41:30.898 --> 41:33.835
Remember that,
um, that GPS beacon for Bella

41:33.901 --> 41:35.837
the shark they tracked?

41:35.903 --> 41:38.673
Here.

41:38.740 --> 41:42.610
So... I searched the last
GPS tracking beacon frequency

41:42.677 --> 41:45.046
sent to the Thasos..

41:45.113 --> 41:48.983
...then I tapped into their sat
network, which just a heads up

41:49.050 --> 41:51.853
is not... entirely legal, but...

41:51.919 --> 41:53.221
Tell me what I'm looking at.

41:53.288 --> 41:55.623
So, I was able to plot
the signal's course.

41:55.690 --> 41:59.027
Whatever Richard and his team
were looking for

41:59.093 --> 42:00.795
it was never up any river.

42:00.862 --> 42:02.964
- Shit, are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

42:03.031 --> 42:05.967
That shark's GPS tracking beacon
was first activated

42:06.034 --> 42:08.303
right... there.

42:08.369 --> 42:12.040
Research facility Akheilos,
owned by some..

42:12.106 --> 42:15.476
billionaire pharmaceutical guy
named Carl Durant.

42:15.543 --> 42:17.979
No, wait, I remember this.
This was on the news, right?

42:18.046 --> 42:19.347
The whole place sank
or something?

42:19.414 --> 42:22.050
Right, took Durant down with it.

42:23.318 --> 42:24.986
I mean, that's weird, right?

42:25.053 --> 42:28.256
I wanna know what these assholes
are doing with the sharks.

42:28.323 --> 42:30.091
Or to them.

42:31.559 --> 42:33.961
- Em, I'm so sorry about Bahari.
- You lied to me!

42:34.028 --> 42:37.231
You didn't track those sharks
from the Orange River.

42:37.298 --> 42:41.035
They-they escaped from
some kind of research facility.

42:41.102 --> 42:42.203
How do you know that?

42:42.270 --> 42:44.138
Those sharks have been altered

42:44.205 --> 42:46.074
engineered,
they're not sharks, Richard!

42:46.140 --> 42:47.942
- They're something else!
- Emma. Emma...

42:48.009 --> 42:50.244
What were they doing
with them in Akheilos?

42:52.080 --> 42:54.749
Lucas! Did you hear that?

42:55.850 --> 42:57.452
Wh-what the hell is happening?

42:57.518 --> 42:59.454
There's too much force
in those hits

42:59.520 --> 43:00.855
they're gonna bust the hull
straight through

43:00.922 --> 43:02.623
the observation window.

43:02.690 --> 43:04.359
The lab. The lab!

43:07.395 --> 43:09.097
That window's not gonna
last much longer.

43:09.163 --> 43:10.431
Our sharks are right there,
what are you waiting for?

43:10.498 --> 43:11.499
Sedate them!

43:11.566 --> 43:12.867
Are we gonna let them
take this ship

43:12.934 --> 43:14.335
down, Richard?

43:16.537 --> 43:18.373
No. Charged tips.

43:18.439 --> 43:19.941
That's not your decision
to make.

43:20.007 --> 43:22.577
You have a kill shot,
you take it.

43:22.643 --> 43:25.213
- 'I'm out of this dump.'
- Richard.

43:25.279 --> 43:27.715
Come on.

43:29.584 --> 43:32.019
They're too deep.
I can't get a shot.

43:34.522 --> 43:36.457
What the..

43:36.524 --> 43:38.726
Get inside,
we're in the line of fire.

43:38.794 --> 43:42.831
- Come on, Miya.
- Hey! Asshole.

43:42.897 --> 43:44.732
If one of those shots
hits over here

43:44.800 --> 43:48.102
you're gonna take
this entire village down.

43:49.604 --> 43:51.539
Fuck!

44:00.915 --> 44:03.184
Richard?

44:03.251 --> 44:05.219
They're here for him.

44:05.286 --> 44:07.955
Then give them
what they want.

44:08.022 --> 44:09.624
I got this.

44:17.732 --> 44:19.634
What are you waiting for?
Let the shark go.

44:19.700 --> 44:22.437
And lose the one live specimen
we have forever?

44:24.038 --> 44:26.340
Not a chance.
Now, give it to me.

44:29.043 --> 44:33.314
Back... the fuck... off.

44:49.697 --> 44:52.200
What just happened?

44:57.238 --> 44:59.440
Your sharks..

45:01.810 --> 45:03.611
...they understood.

45:09.050 --> 45:10.585
Okay, you deserve
an explanation...

45:10.651 --> 45:14.021
No! No, not another one
of your explanations, Richard.

45:14.088 --> 45:17.325
The truth!

45:17.391 --> 45:20.929
Those two sharks were
trying to save their brother.

45:20.995 --> 45:24.732
It didn't start with Akheilos,
that was second gen work.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.767
It started with research
on makos

45:26.835 --> 45:30.238
trying to acquire proteins
to treat Alzheimer's.

45:30.304 --> 45:32.473
Right, but they couldn't
harvest enough for a trial

45:32.540 --> 45:35.743
the makos' brains were
too small, so?

45:35.811 --> 45:37.813
Were.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.983
They genetically engineered them
to have larger brains?

45:41.048 --> 45:42.985
Along came Carl Durant.

45:43.050 --> 45:46.387
Now, he acquired that research
with a different goal.

45:46.454 --> 45:49.892
If he could increase
the intelligence of bulls

45:49.958 --> 45:52.760
he could engineer
the same treatment for humans.

45:54.930 --> 45:56.364
An evolutionary leap.

45:56.430 --> 45:57.698
You sound like you believe that.

45:57.765 --> 45:59.133
'They blew up Akheilos to stop'

45:59.200 --> 46:00.969
those sharks from escaping.

46:01.035 --> 46:03.005
Bella and her pups
got out alive.

46:03.070 --> 46:05.306
They've been trying to capture
and kill them ever since.

46:05.373 --> 46:09.310
Explosive lures, poison,
never the same way twice.

46:09.377 --> 46:12.313
Yeah. Right.
Because they're learning.

46:12.380 --> 46:15.583
Those are the last
of Bella's offspring.

46:15.650 --> 46:17.552
The only three left.

46:17.618 --> 46:20.789
Genotics Labs bought the patents
for treating Alzheimer's

46:20.856 --> 46:22.323
and increasing intelligence.

46:22.390 --> 46:24.225
Okay, so you're gonna
carve up Scarface up there...

46:24.292 --> 46:28.396
'Oh, my God!
Just spare me the judgment, Emma.'

46:28.462 --> 46:31.934
Now, we can help people,
not just talk about it.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.969
- Oh.

46:34.036 --> 46:36.203
Watch.

46:40.141 --> 46:43.644
When I activate Bella's tracker

46:43.711 --> 46:47.415
that shark's extremely
sensitive neuro-electro

46:47.481 --> 46:50.618
reception system,
its sixth sense, kicks in.

46:55.656 --> 46:57.758
He misses her.

46:57.826 --> 47:00.796
When these sharks were born,
their-their brains were

47:00.862 --> 47:02.831
imprinted with their mother's
tracker frequency

47:02.898 --> 47:05.433
I mean, it's one of this
shit show's happy accidents.

47:05.499 --> 47:06.267
Don't.

47:06.334 --> 47:07.836
It makes for a powerful,

47:07.903 --> 47:09.370
emotional connection.

47:09.437 --> 47:12.340
I-I-I used it to draw the bulls
to me yesterday

47:12.406 --> 47:14.141
and even though that they knew
that their mother was dead

47:14.208 --> 47:15.610
they couldn't help themselves.

47:15.676 --> 47:18.046
Right, so that's why
you had Bella's beacon.

47:18.112 --> 47:22.116
I-I just.. I can't get
close enough to catching them.

47:22.183 --> 47:24.418
They're too smart.

47:24.485 --> 47:28.023
But they're drawn to this
frequency just the same.

47:28.090 --> 47:29.724
Emma..

47:29.791 --> 47:32.360
If-if we can study
that shark's brain

47:32.426 --> 47:35.030
if we can develop the same
kind of bond in people

47:35.097 --> 47:36.597
imagine how we can
change the world

47:36.664 --> 47:40.836
to make humanity feel, Emma,
and from that... to act.

47:40.902 --> 47:43.437
Stop it, just turn it off.

47:45.040 --> 47:46.607
Stop.

47:50.511 --> 47:56.051
- This is torture.
- No, Emma, this is progress.

47:56.118 --> 47:57.819
Turn it off, I swear
to fucking God

47:57.886 --> 48:01.823
you better turn that off,
fucking turn it off, Richard!

48:01.890 --> 48:03.658
It's off.

48:13.167 --> 48:17.271
I'm sorry. But I lied because
I knew you would never approve.

48:17.338 --> 48:18.840
Well, you're right
about one thing then.

48:18.907 --> 48:21.409
That is the most valuable animal
on the planet

48:21.475 --> 48:23.277
and the clock is ticking.

48:23.344 --> 48:24.578
These juveniles
are maturing faster

48:24.645 --> 48:25.881
than we've ever seen before

48:25.947 --> 48:28.683
if we fail to capture
the other two right here

48:28.749 --> 48:31.053
right now, if they mate,
I mean, you see what they can do

48:31.119 --> 48:33.822
how they can kill.

48:33.889 --> 48:36.925
It's the end of the ocean.

48:36.992 --> 48:39.861
Everything that we care about.

48:39.928 --> 48:41.863
Can't you see that?

48:44.665 --> 48:46.935
Yeah.

48:48.736 --> 48:50.204
Yeah, I see.

48:50.271 --> 48:52.640
I see you knew exactly
what we were dealing with

48:52.707 --> 48:54.843
and someone I care about
is dead.

48:59.680 --> 49:03.952
- I don't know what that was.
- But I kinda loved it.

49:15.897 --> 49:18.399
Shouldn't have told
your girl anything.

49:18.466 --> 49:20.434
Your damn sharks are smarter
than you are.

49:20.501 --> 49:22.603
Window's been fixed,
you can go.

49:22.670 --> 49:25.841
Yeah? You're-you're out here
trying to save the world

49:25.907 --> 49:28.743
but you don't mind putting
everyone else's lives in danger.

49:28.810 --> 49:30.678
I said get out, Lucas.

49:30.745 --> 49:32.580
Why keep this
magic shark lure of yours

49:32.646 --> 49:36.118
a secret from us, Richard?
Huh?

49:36.184 --> 49:37.518
Hey, give it back.

49:39.420 --> 49:42.356
Oh, you didn't want
Genotics Labs to know?

49:42.423 --> 49:44.159
Worried about the ethics here?

49:44.226 --> 49:46.995
Or your own future payday
when you quit working

49:47.062 --> 49:49.197
for Genotics
and start your own company?

49:49.263 --> 49:51.632
- That's absurd.
- Is it?

49:51.699 --> 49:54.535
If you hadn't kept this from us,
we might've finished

49:54.602 --> 49:58.039
our work here
a whole lot quicker.

49:58.106 --> 49:59.673
What are you gonna do?

49:59.740 --> 50:03.145
You're so smart,
what do you think?

50:03.211 --> 50:05.247
Oh, come on,
don't look so surprised.

50:05.312 --> 50:09.084
We're not the
ones who upgraded a shark,

50:09.151 --> 50:11.887
but we are the sorry assholes
they sent in

50:11.953 --> 50:14.655
to clean up the mess.

50:14.722 --> 50:17.625
Two bull sharks attack
a 100-foot ship

50:17.691 --> 50:20.896
and then back off because
they recognized a weapon?

50:22.463 --> 50:25.566
That's not real,
that... doesn't happen.

50:25.633 --> 50:27.701
- You saw it too.
- We sure did.

50:27.768 --> 50:31.807
- Okay, so what do we do now?
- Report it.

50:31.873 --> 50:33.809
- Spin?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

50:33.875 --> 50:35.844
- Why?
- The Internet's down again.

50:35.911 --> 50:41.515
Basically everything that
I live for... almost everything.

50:41.582 --> 50:44.451
- Could it be the satellite?
- Uh, yeah. Could be.

50:46.988 --> 50:48.756
Okay, hold the fort.

50:58.632 --> 51:00.001
Alright, boys.

51:02.603 --> 51:04.973
- Time to finish this.
- Copy.

51:07.042 --> 51:08.944
They're going back in.

51:09.010 --> 51:11.445
They have something in that
pretty funky-looking metal case.

51:11.512 --> 51:14.348
Like, funky
in a James Brown way, or..

51:15.482 --> 51:16.818
What do you think?

51:20.322 --> 51:23.624
- Is that drone fixed and ready?
- Yeah.

51:23.691 --> 51:25.827
Let's see what they're up to.

51:41.977 --> 51:44.813
- Oh.
- Be careful. Thanks.

52:17.544 --> 52:18.947
Close, but not too close.

52:19.014 --> 52:21.149
Love the range
on this baby.

52:49.878 --> 52:51.512
What the hell are they doing?

52:51.578 --> 52:54.515
Hey, guys, come in here!

52:54.581 --> 52:56.918
I've got the drone feed
on the Triton.

53:01.588 --> 53:03.825
Let's see what they've got
in that case.

53:06.094 --> 53:07.929
Zoom in.

53:12.133 --> 53:14.202
Oh, shit.

53:14.269 --> 53:17.172
What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?

53:17.238 --> 53:19.240
What does he mean, "Oh, shit"?

53:23.744 --> 53:26.147
I gotta find Emma... now.

53:40.462 --> 53:42.529
Shit.

53:42.596 --> 53:45.066
Dumb idea, Dr. Collins.

53:45.133 --> 53:47.135
Emma, where are you?

54:10.524 --> 54:11.960
Fuck.

54:25.306 --> 54:26.908
Okay, so here's the deal.

54:26.975 --> 54:30.145
- They cut the satellite line.
- Emma.

54:30.211 --> 54:32.613
They got one shark
they're gonna carve up

54:32.679 --> 54:34.816
and they wanna kill
the other two... fast.

54:34.883 --> 54:37.485
If those two juvie bulls
start making babies...

54:37.551 --> 54:40.088
We're talking... seamageddon.

54:41.890 --> 54:44.993
- Seamageddon?
- Bigger fish to fry, Emma.

54:45.060 --> 54:48.129
What? No,
this is as big as it gets...

54:48.196 --> 54:51.232
Listen to me, that was a mine
that they drilled

54:51.299 --> 54:53.168
into the nursery wall.

54:55.569 --> 54:56.971
For sinking ships.

54:57.038 --> 54:59.740
Her dad and I used to employ
the same ones in the Gulf.

54:59.808 --> 55:01.910
'They magnetically attach
to the hull.'

55:01.976 --> 55:04.479
They pack a hell of a punch,
believe me.

55:04.546 --> 55:06.014
How do they use the mine?

55:06.081 --> 55:08.682
Hope that they get lucky
that those two bull sharks

55:08.749 --> 55:11.052
happen to swim by?

55:11.119 --> 55:12.554
Geography.

55:12.619 --> 55:15.123
The nursery is in a trench,
a canyon enclosed by two walls.

55:15.190 --> 55:17.859
The shockwave from that mine
will bounce between the walls

55:17.926 --> 55:20.095
back and forth creating
a fucking blender from hell.

55:20.161 --> 55:23.865
'The kinetic energy in that
canyon will destroy everything.'

55:23.932 --> 55:25.599
'The shockwave will then
funnel up'

55:25.666 --> 55:28.069
creating a massive wave,
a mini tsunami.

55:28.136 --> 55:30.771
It'll hit Little Happy
with full force, point-blank

55:30.839 --> 55:32.474
and take the entire village
down.

55:32.540 --> 55:34.109
And us with it.

55:34.175 --> 55:37.245
The only safe place for miles
will be their goddamn boat.

55:39.314 --> 55:42.317
- I need to talk to Richard.
- It won't make a difference.

55:42.383 --> 55:46.888
- Emma!
- Shaw. Stay put. I mean it.

55:54.896 --> 55:58.500
Were you gonna warn us? Or were
you just gonna let us drown?

55:58.566 --> 56:01.402
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the mine.

56:03.404 --> 56:05.639
Emma..

56:05.706 --> 56:07.475
What mine?

56:07.542 --> 56:09.911
The one you put
in the nursery.

56:09.978 --> 56:12.780
Do you seriously think
I'm supposed to believe

56:12.847 --> 56:14.816
you didn't know anything
about it, Richard?

56:14.883 --> 56:16.784
'Or about cutting the satellite
com line?'

56:16.851 --> 56:19.220
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

56:22.257 --> 56:23.825
Lucas.

56:25.393 --> 56:26.828
Hey.

56:29.297 --> 56:33.334
- What did you do?
- I followed orders.

56:33.401 --> 56:38.139
Find Bella, capture or kill her
offspring before they can breed

56:38.206 --> 56:41.176
which could be pretty much
any time now.

56:41.242 --> 56:43.811
They'll probably have
fucking hands by then.

56:43.878 --> 56:45.346
So I'm choosing "kill."

56:45.413 --> 56:48.183
Lucas, our orders didn't
include blowing anything up

56:48.249 --> 56:49.384
or murdering anybody.

56:49.450 --> 56:52.854
Well, you really think
that they sent us here

56:52.921 --> 56:54.455
to develop drugs
for slow kids?

56:54.522 --> 56:57.892
Or what? So-so they can get As
and learn to play the oboe

56:57.959 --> 57:00.261
on their way to Harvard?

57:00.328 --> 57:03.398
Genotics Labs didn't send us
here to benefit mankind

57:03.464 --> 57:05.967
you dumb shit!

57:06.034 --> 57:07.502
They're just covering
their asses

57:07.569 --> 57:10.638
protecting their patents,
their stock price.

57:10.704 --> 57:14.509
Because the people-the people
who control everything now

57:14.576 --> 57:17.145
man, they will pay anything
so their kids

57:17.212 --> 57:19.514
can control everything
when all this starts

57:19.581 --> 57:20.982
to turn to shit.

57:21.049 --> 57:23.851
"Here you go, kid,
here's a billion dollars

57:23.918 --> 57:27.088
and 40 IQ points."

57:27.155 --> 57:29.723
See, it's all about
survival, folks.

57:32.393 --> 57:33.394
Get inside.

57:33.461 --> 57:35.563
And survival's all
about the money.

57:35.630 --> 57:36.831
Get inside! Go now!

57:36.898 --> 57:37.966
- Take cover!
- 'Shaw!'

57:38.032 --> 57:39.234
Not everyone gets to be a shark.

57:39.300 --> 57:41.636
- Wait, no!
- Go! Go! Go!

57:41.703 --> 57:43.538
Faster, Spin!

57:52.413 --> 57:55.783
- No! Shaw, watch out!
- Shaw!

58:03.157 --> 58:06.361
- Shaw!
- No, no!

58:09.864 --> 58:11.966
Get down!

58:32.687 --> 58:33.855
- Lucas!
- Stop!

58:33.921 --> 58:36.124
What the hell are you doing?

58:36.190 --> 58:39.260
What I'm paid to do.
Clean up the mess.

58:48.870 --> 58:50.338
Fuck!

58:55.810 --> 58:57.445
We need to get higher.

59:00.848 --> 59:04.085
No! Stop! Stop!
Let go!

59:05.953 --> 59:08.690
Emma!

59:08.756 --> 59:11.225
Stop! No!

59:35.350 --> 59:37.018
- Emma, run!

59:37.085 --> 59:39.520
Take care of that, Schill!

59:47.995 --> 59:52.100
'Where are our fucking
Einsteins when you fucking need them?'

59:55.370 --> 01:00:00.007
- No, no. We gotta get out!
- No! No! Spin! Spin! Spin!

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:01.609
There are sharks out there!

01:00:08.616 --> 01:00:10.551
Miya! Spin!

01:00:10.618 --> 01:00:12.887
- Shaw!
- Shaw!

01:00:12.954 --> 01:00:16.491
Shark! Stay inside!
I'll get you out!

01:00:33.141 --> 01:00:35.209
- Shaw.
- Emma.

01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:39.614
Shaw.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.449
Are you alright? You good?

01:00:41.516 --> 01:00:43.050
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:45.386
- Miya. Spin?
- Inside.

01:00:46.687 --> 01:00:48.356
Oh, my God.

01:00:48.423 --> 01:00:50.625
- Oh, my God, I can...
- Emma, don't press your luck.

01:00:50.691 --> 01:00:52.193
The shark's right under there.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.328
If we don't defuse that mine,
none of us will make it.

01:00:54.395 --> 01:00:56.063
The moment they get that ship
to a safe distance

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.199
they'll detonate it.

01:00:58.266 --> 01:01:02.036
Look, you get Miya and Spin,
I'll get the mine.

01:01:02.103 --> 01:01:03.638
No, you swim like a walrus,
I dive.

01:01:03.704 --> 01:01:06.007
- Fine, whatever.
- When I find it, what do I do?

01:01:06.073 --> 01:01:07.742
Get your ass back here, fast.

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:09.610
I'll figure out a way
to defuse it.

01:01:09.677 --> 01:01:11.078
- Go.
- Okay.

01:01:21.489 --> 01:01:24.258
Careful, Shaw! Be careful!

01:01:33.134 --> 01:01:35.838
- Miya.
- Shaw!

01:01:35.904 --> 01:01:39.207
- Spin!
- Shaw!

01:01:39.273 --> 01:01:42.911
- Shaw!
- Shaw!

01:01:42.977 --> 01:01:45.713
Shaw!

01:02:10.873 --> 01:02:14.008
You know what to do.

01:02:14.075 --> 01:02:15.576
Done.

01:02:18.713 --> 01:02:20.515
Lucas, whatever you're
thinking about doing,

01:02:20.581 --> 01:02:22.283
just stop, please!

01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:27.321
You have a choice to make,
boss.

01:02:27.388 --> 01:02:30.291
Stay on the ship
and collect your check

01:02:30.358 --> 01:02:33.962
or you can join
your grad school crush.

01:02:34.028 --> 01:02:36.464
Should be a no-brainer, Richard.

01:02:36.531 --> 01:02:39.801
You know, these sharks
are more human than you are now.

01:02:39.868 --> 01:02:41.736
'At least they care enough to
try and get their brother back.'

01:02:41.803 --> 01:02:46.140
What do you care about, Lucas?
Getting out and getting paid.

01:02:54.816 --> 01:02:57.118
You're right.

01:02:57.184 --> 01:02:59.253
It is a no-brainer.

01:03:03.491 --> 01:03:05.059
No.

01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:10.398
I would rather die with her
than live like you.

01:03:24.312 --> 01:03:26.347
Shark lover, eh?

01:03:28.817 --> 01:03:31.385
Look at me. Dive.

01:03:31.452 --> 01:03:33.387
Just dive.

01:03:41.596 --> 01:03:43.331
Take it.

01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:47.635
Breathe.

01:03:47.702 --> 01:03:50.171
You got this.

01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:57.111
Yeah.

01:04:00.414 --> 01:04:02.650
Little tour before we go.

01:04:08.155 --> 01:04:10.558
We'll go around the back.

01:04:18.466 --> 01:04:20.334
Just you stay here, and, uh...

01:04:20.401 --> 01:04:22.603
Wait, stay here?
You stay here.

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:25.306
No, we need to see if one
of those things is out there.

01:04:26.407 --> 01:04:27.441
- Okay.
- Spin.

01:04:27.508 --> 01:04:29.210
I'll be right back, okay?

01:04:29.276 --> 01:04:34.148
- Spin. Promise me.
- I promise.

01:04:34.215 --> 01:04:37.853
- Promise promise?
- Promise promise.

01:05:07.049 --> 01:05:08.516
Shit.

01:05:10.184 --> 01:05:13.121
Hey, neighbor.

01:05:13.187 --> 01:05:14.655
Fuck.

01:05:21.963 --> 01:05:23.764
Come on, man.

01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:29.437
You ain't gotta do this.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.115
Come on, old man.

01:05:40.182 --> 01:05:42.750
Let's see what you got.

01:05:42.818 --> 01:05:46.454
What'd you say?
I left my hearing aide inside.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.389
Why don't you come
a little closer, sonny?

01:05:48.456 --> 01:05:50.826
- Sonny?
- 'Yeah, that's right.'

01:05:50.892 --> 01:05:52.393
Yeah.

01:05:55.262 --> 01:05:57.598
- Come on, bitch.
- Yeah.

01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:24.391
You promised.

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:36.905
- Ah!
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:06:38.439 --> 01:06:40.341
One of them's
right out there.

01:06:40.407 --> 01:06:42.510
- Okay? We gotta hide.
- Hide?

01:06:42.576 --> 01:06:44.745
- Now.
- Hide where?

01:06:50.152 --> 01:06:51.887
Oh, shit! Holy shit!

01:06:53.521 --> 01:06:56.925
Go upstairs! Go, go, go!

01:06:59.995 --> 01:07:03.430
Here, come on!

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:06.034
Shit, shit, shit.

01:07:31.392 --> 01:07:34.162
I was expecting more from you,
old man!

01:07:34.229 --> 01:07:36.630
That was way too easy.

01:07:36.697 --> 01:07:39.034
Now, come on. Get up.

01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:42.703
Get up!

01:07:49.343 --> 01:07:53.048
Fuck.
The beacon.

01:07:56.251 --> 01:08:01.189
Miya, I gotta tell you
something, 'cause if I don't..

01:08:01.256 --> 01:08:06.694
All my life, I've been,
like, afraid, of everything.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.965
And-and, and then I met you.

01:08:11.066 --> 01:08:13.335
And you make me less afraid.

01:08:13.434 --> 01:08:15.170
And I love that.

01:08:15.237 --> 01:08:18.206
And I love that-that
you laugh at my jokes

01:08:18.273 --> 01:08:19.941
even though they're not funny.

01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:21.742
And I love that
you make fun of me

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:25.412
when I say stupid stuff,
which is, like, all the time.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:30.618
And... I just love
how you make me feel.

01:08:30.684 --> 01:08:33.720
And, uh,
when we get out of this

01:08:33.787 --> 01:08:37.058
and we will get out of this,
I promise

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:39.794
when we do..

01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:43.031
I'd really like to hang out
with you some more.

01:08:53.573 --> 01:08:55.576
It's okay.

01:08:58.746 --> 01:09:01.715
- Oh. Spin.
- Holy shit!

01:09:01.783 --> 01:09:04.618
There is blood.
It's everywhere.

01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:18.564
That was close.

01:09:37.919 --> 01:09:40.388
Earl!

01:09:40.453 --> 01:09:42.555
Finish this piece of shit.

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:45.961
Then get back to the ship.

01:09:50.464 --> 01:09:51.433
Come on!

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.923
- No!
- Fuck!

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.524
No, no, no!

01:10:33.074 --> 01:10:35.810
Not a coffin,
not a coffin.

01:10:40.382 --> 01:10:43.084
Not a coffin, not a coffin.

01:10:43.151 --> 01:10:45.920
Not a coffin.
Not a coffin.

01:10:53.461 --> 01:10:55.864
Not a coffin, not a coffin.

01:10:57.598 --> 01:10:59.934
- Ah!
- Miya!

01:11:00.001 --> 01:11:01.136
Argh!

01:11:38.373 --> 01:11:40.641
No! No! No!

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:54.522
No!

01:12:21.615 --> 01:12:23.818
Oh, Sally.

01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:51.246
Schill, you finish her yet?

01:12:55.316 --> 01:12:56.885
Schill.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.157
'Shaw, can you hear me? Shaw?'

01:13:02.223 --> 01:13:05.426
- Emma?
- 'Where are you? Come in.'

01:13:08.096 --> 01:13:11.299
- Emma!
- 'Shaw? Oh, God, Shaw.'

01:13:13.935 --> 01:13:17.872
'Listen to me.
I need your help.'

01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:20.808
Emma, those bulls
are right on top of you.

01:13:20.875 --> 01:13:24.711
Yeah, no shit.
I have the mine.

01:13:24.779 --> 01:13:26.548
And these two bulls
know what it is.

01:13:26.614 --> 01:13:27.849
What do you mean?

01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:29.384
'Richard said
they used explosives'

01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:32.220
on those sharks before.

01:13:32.287 --> 01:13:34.055
I think I can get back.

01:13:50.205 --> 01:13:55.210
Shaw! The Thasos,
it's about to leave!

01:13:55.276 --> 01:13:58.279
Emma, Lucas is about to go,
he can blow the mine

01:13:58.346 --> 01:14:00.548
at any moment,
you need to disarm it.

01:14:00.615 --> 01:14:03.418
'I'm in the cove,
these bulls on my ass, '

01:14:03.484 --> 01:14:04.986
'can you get 'em off me?'

01:14:07.622 --> 01:14:08.690
Stand by.

01:14:20.835 --> 01:14:22.736
Grab his legs.

01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:44.158
- Sorry, chum.

01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:47.295
Thanks, Shaw.
And so sorry.

01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:51.332
- Sorry? Sorry about what, Emma?
- 'Something I gotta do.'

01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:54.435
- What?
- 'You won't like it. Bye.'

01:14:54.502 --> 01:14:57.771
Bye? No, not bye.
What do you mean, "Bye"?

01:14:59.173 --> 01:15:00.808
Emma!

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.896
Emma, Lucas is leaving. Emma!

01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:37.178
God.

01:15:40.415 --> 01:15:42.083
Miss me?

01:15:46.988 --> 01:15:49.190
Sharks got them.

01:16:00.868 --> 01:16:03.137
Lucas.

01:16:03.204 --> 01:16:05.473
In his hand,
he's got the detonator.

01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:09.877
Where's the mine?

01:16:16.584 --> 01:16:19.387
Little Happy..

01:16:19.454 --> 01:16:21.389
...meet Big Unhappy.

01:16:53.688 --> 01:16:56.958
Let's get out of here.
We can all agree on that, right?

01:16:57.024 --> 01:16:58.326
- We'll take my boat.
- Alright.

01:16:58.393 --> 01:17:00.428
I'll get some freshwater,
some supplies.

01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:03.464
Emma?

01:17:03.531 --> 01:17:05.099
I can't leave.

01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:08.336
What are you talking about?

01:17:08.403 --> 01:17:10.738
I'm not asking either one of you
to stay, but I can't go,

01:17:10.806 --> 01:17:12.206
not until it's over.

01:17:12.273 --> 01:17:16.644
It is goddamn over.
We're alive, guys.

01:17:16.711 --> 01:17:19.914
So are those bulls. Richard and
that asshole Lucas were right.

01:17:19.981 --> 01:17:22.150
If those things mate..

01:17:22.216 --> 01:17:23.518
...we don't know
what they could become.

01:17:23.584 --> 01:17:25.186
They're right?
What are you talking about?

01:17:25.253 --> 01:17:27.522
You spent your entire life
trying to save sharks.

01:17:27.588 --> 01:17:30.224
I know, but..

01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:32.960
- But what?
- This is bigger than us.

01:17:33.027 --> 01:17:35.029
Not our responsibility, ladies.

01:17:35.096 --> 01:17:37.698
Well, if it's not our
responsibility, Shaw, whose?

01:17:39.835 --> 01:17:44.038
We're the only ones on Earth
who can stop them... right now.

01:17:44.105 --> 01:17:46.240
We're not gonna get
another chance.

01:17:49.944 --> 01:17:52.113
My dad never backed away
from a fight.

01:17:53.882 --> 01:17:57.952
He just fought harder.
What about you?

01:18:00.388 --> 01:18:03.892
You gotta be fucking
kidding me, Emma.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.660
So how will you find
these monsters?

01:18:05.726 --> 01:18:09.932
Exactly. They're gone,
they could be miles away by now.

01:18:09.997 --> 01:18:12.633
They're not monsters,
we did this to them.

01:18:21.476 --> 01:18:24.579
- Shark's GPS beacon.
- Not just any shark.

01:18:24.645 --> 01:18:27.548
Bella. Their mother.

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:29.250
They sense this every day
of their lives.

01:18:29.317 --> 01:18:31.352
Richard told me that
their brains even imprinted

01:18:31.419 --> 01:18:35.556
on this specific frequency,
they followed it like instinct

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:36.825
I saw it myself. Alright?

01:18:36.892 --> 01:18:41.429
To these bulls...
this beacon is their mother.

01:18:42.931 --> 01:18:44.499
I don't get it.

01:18:48.135 --> 01:18:50.271
I'm not going after them.

01:18:53.074 --> 01:18:55.743
I'm gonna get them
to come back.

01:19:02.283 --> 01:19:05.921
- This is all we got.
- Not all.

01:19:05.988 --> 01:19:07.488
I'm gonna attach this
to the drone

01:19:07.555 --> 01:19:09.590
bring them into the cove,
right past your house

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:12.260
and past here,
and around and around

01:19:12.326 --> 01:19:14.262
until we kill them.

01:19:18.366 --> 01:19:21.168
- For Bahari.
- For Miya and Spin.

01:19:21.235 --> 01:19:23.271
For all of us.

01:19:36.284 --> 01:19:38.352
Okay, I'm coming around.

01:19:50.698 --> 01:19:52.868
'Okay, I'm going right.'

01:19:55.736 --> 01:19:57.271
'Going around.'

01:19:58.874 --> 01:20:00.474
I see them!

01:20:04.645 --> 01:20:07.548
- I got 'em.
- Reel 'em in.

01:20:07.615 --> 01:20:10.484
- 'Bring 'em in close.'
- Alright.

01:20:11.519 --> 01:20:15.189
There you go.
Ride 'em in, that's it.

01:20:27.836 --> 01:20:29.437
'Emma!'

01:20:29.503 --> 01:20:33.474
Shit, they're losing interest.

01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:35.509
- What's going on?
- Fuck.

01:20:35.576 --> 01:20:38.279
I don't..
It's stuck on something.

01:20:38.346 --> 01:20:39.513
What do you mean, "it's stuck"?

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.148
- I gotta cut it loose.
- Let me see.

01:20:41.215 --> 01:20:43.217
Look. We'll never catch them
if we don't.

01:20:43.284 --> 01:20:46.120
- Not a chance, I got this.
- Shaw, wait!

01:20:46.888 --> 01:20:49.992
Shaw! Shaw.

01:20:57.231 --> 01:20:59.433
You're almost there!

01:21:24.358 --> 01:21:25.760
You see 'em?

01:21:33.534 --> 01:21:35.469
Shaw.

01:21:43.611 --> 01:21:45.746
Yes. Yes!

01:21:49.283 --> 01:21:51.719
Come on in.
Shaw, come on!

01:21:55.423 --> 01:21:59.795
- Shaw! Get out! Get out! Shaw!
- Shaw!

01:21:59.861 --> 01:22:03.531
- Shaw! Shaw!
- Shaw! Get out of the water!

01:22:03.597 --> 01:22:05.566
- Fuck, Shaw!
- Shaw!

01:22:05.633 --> 01:22:08.870
Shaw, get out of the water!
Get out of the water!

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.177
- Shaw! Get out!
- 'Shaw!'

01:22:22.216 --> 01:22:24.152
- Shaw! Shaw!

01:22:38.967 --> 01:22:40.301
Shaw!

01:22:49.276 --> 01:22:51.012
Shaw!

01:23:01.156 --> 01:23:03.225
Shaw!

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.511
Where are you going, bitch?
Huh? Where are you going?

01:23:23.577 --> 01:23:26.248
You're not going anywhere.
Where are you going?

01:23:26.313 --> 01:23:28.716
- Argh!
- You got nowhere to run.

01:23:34.156 --> 01:23:36.925
You little shit!

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.964
Too easy! Come on!
Come on!

01:23:46.134 --> 01:23:47.869
Drown, bitch!

01:23:56.044 --> 01:23:57.879
Hey, asshole! Argh!

01:24:01.817 --> 01:24:05.120
That the best you got?
You stupid bitch.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.983
Emma, no.

01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:44.786
Hey! Come here!

01:25:47.789 --> 01:25:50.524
- Come here!
- Shit!

01:25:53.594 --> 01:25:55.529
- Fuck, Emma.

01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:53.021
Come on! Come on!

01:27:08.436 --> 01:27:10.604
Fuck! Oh.

01:27:11.672 --> 01:27:13.174
I'm so sorry.

01:27:38.433 --> 01:27:39.700
- No!

01:29:02.517 --> 01:29:04.119
Emma.

01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:25.006
You're crazy, you know that?

01:30:13.421 --> 01:30:14.923
It was a beautiful place.

01:30:21.362 --> 01:30:23.298
'Sally.'

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.275
Emma.

01:30:36.277 --> 01:30:38.112
It's ours.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.904
You're not a shark.

01:31:06.474 --> 01:31:13.281
Oh, my God, come here.
Miya. It's okay. It's okay.

01:31:17.885 --> 01:31:20.154
You're okay.

01:31:20.221 --> 01:31:22.857
Come, sit here,
you'll be alright.

01:31:26.661 --> 01:31:28.329
What happened?

01:31:37.605 --> 01:31:39.507
Where to, Ems?

01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:45.880
How do you guys feel
about civilization?

01:31:48.082 --> 01:31:51.452
- I'd love to give it a try.
- Me too.

01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:57.158
- Let's do it.
- You're stuck with us now.

01:31:59.394 --> 01:32:03.798
I hope so.
Planet's not gonna save itself.
