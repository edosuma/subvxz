42:46.667 --> 42:49.542
- Yeah, well, I'm blocked, so it's moot.

42:49.542 --> 42:52.167
<i>- Hey, what happened to all that</i>
<i>symbiosis we had going on?</i>

42:52.167 --> 42:55.750
Open up that croc trap of yours
and let me peck around.

42:55.750 --> 42:57.667
- So you admit you're the plover.

42:57.667 --> 42:58.833
- If it's working.

43:00.042 --> 43:01.958
- Hmm. Nothing's working.

43:02.958 --> 43:04.875
- Maybe you're too in your head.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.375
- Where else would I be?

43:06.375 --> 43:08.833
- No, I mean, maybe
you're thinking too much

43:08.833 --> 43:10.875
about something that should
happen more naturally.

43:10.875 --> 43:14.833
- I don't know, I mean, maybe...
talk me through what you do?

43:14.833 --> 43:16.042
<i>How do you get there?</i>

43:16.042 --> 43:18.125
- Are you suggesting we have phone sex?

43:18.125 --> 43:19.417
- Am I?

43:20.417 --> 43:21.792
Should we?

43:22.792 --> 43:23.875
Do you know how?

43:24.667 --> 43:28.375
- Maybe. I... I think I'm supposed to say
a bunch of stuff to turn you on.

43:28.375 --> 43:29.583
- Okay.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.250
Go!
- Uh...

43:33.250 --> 43:34.708
Jeez, uh...

43:34.708 --> 43:37.167
Uh, how's, uh...

43:37.167 --> 43:40.667
[speaking Vulcan language]

43:40.667 --> 43:42.167
- Wait, Vulcan?

43:42.167 --> 43:44.458
Larson, no way.

43:44.458 --> 43:45.542
[laughs]

43:45.542 --> 43:47.042
Very impressed.

43:47.042 --> 43:47.958
- Yeah.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.792
Th-There was an online tutorial.
<i>- Yeah, it's impressive.</i>

43:51.667 --> 43:53.875
But, uh... ineffective.

43:53.875 --> 43:55.583
- Are you judging yourself?

43:55.583 --> 43:57.625
- Oh, right.

43:57.625 --> 43:58.875
Okay, hang on.

44:00.958 --> 44:02.083
- Ah.

44:03.292 --> 44:04.708
- Okay, continue.

44:04.708 --> 44:07.292
[speaking Vulcan]

44:08.167 --> 44:09.542
...sexy.

44:09.542 --> 44:11.833
- Nothin'.

44:11.833 --> 44:13.583
God, what am I doing wrong?

44:13.583 --> 44:15.458
- No, maybe it's my Vulcan.

44:15.458 --> 44:17.667
I should just recite the periodic table.

44:17.667 --> 44:19.167
- Ha, ha.

44:19.167 --> 44:20.833
- Or name an element after you.

44:23.625 --> 44:25.750
- Wait...
Say that again?

44:25.750 --> 44:29.250
- There should be an element
on the periodic table named after you?

44:30.542 --> 44:33.500
Uh, a never-before-seen metal.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.958
Avery Namium.

44:36.458 --> 44:38.792
- Well, there... there was a tingle.

44:39.458 --> 44:42.250
Keep going.
- Th-This new element...

44:42.250 --> 44:45.042
uh, you found it on your voyage to Mars.

44:45.042 --> 44:48.167
- I went to Mars?
- After you graduated from MIT.

44:50.125 --> 44:51.417
- Summa cum laude?

44:51.417 --> 44:53.792
- Oh, yeah, and you got this grant.

44:53.792 --> 44:55.458
- I got a research grant? Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

44:55.458 --> 44:59.708
So they sent you to Mars, and because
of this whole new element thing,

44:59.708 --> 45:02.292
the capital of Mars is now Averyopolis.

45:02.292 --> 45:04.833
- Yeah?
- Yeah. A thriving new colony.

45:04.833 --> 45:07.417
And you're their leader,
and it's a super chill place

45:07.417 --> 45:11.292
so no surprise, you were awarded
a Nobel Peace Prize.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.833
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

45:12.833 --> 45:15.583
- Oh, my God, oh, yeah.
Yeah, this is working.

45:15.583 --> 45:17.792
- Are you there?
- Oh, almost there.

45:17.792 --> 45:19.958
- Y-You'll win STEMCON, STEM awards.

45:19.958 --> 45:21.208

45:21.208 --> 45:22.625
[gasps] Oh, fuck!

45:22.625 --> 45:24.167
Oh, God, oh, no.

45:24.167 --> 45:27.333
Okay, I'm losing it, I'm losing it.
<i>- Avery? You there?</i>

45:27.333 --> 45:28.708

45:28.708 --> 45:30.917
Yeah, no, it's, that's gone.

45:30.917 --> 45:31.833
Mm.

45:34.625 --> 45:35.708

45:36.250 --> 45:38.083
<i>STEM night was a week away</i>

45:38.083 --> 45:41.583
<i>and I had yet to crack the code</i>
<i>for my night with Casper, or my app.</i>

45:42.667 --> 45:46.167
All right, people.
Insights on female pleasure. Go.

45:46.167 --> 45:49.500
- I just want to point out that if I ever
said anything like that to you,

45:49.500 --> 45:51.167
I'd be so canceled.

45:51.167 --> 45:54.292
- Okay, clearly, since I'm the only one
here who's actually been with a girl,

45:54.292 --> 45:55.750
I'll take this one.

45:55.750 --> 45:59.292
Tell your partner to enjoy you
like an ice cream cone that's melting.

45:59.292 --> 46:01.750
Catch every last drop.

46:01.750 --> 46:03.042
- Maybe he doesn't do dairy.

46:03.042 --> 46:05.250
- Hmm. Okay, does he like
to do the crossword?

46:05.250 --> 46:07.250
- Be surprised if he didn't,
everyone does.

46:07.250 --> 46:10.167
- Have him fill out the boxes
with a pointy tongue going across

46:10.167 --> 46:11.417
and a flat one going down.

46:11.417 --> 46:13.667
- Ah, la-la-la-la-la-la!
- Oh, my God, Troy!

46:13.667 --> 46:16.167
I'm like destroying this equation
up here and you're missing it.

46:16.167 --> 46:17.708
Just be less, 'kay?

46:17.708 --> 46:19.917
Okay, we're going to put that
over a negative three...

46:19.917 --> 46:22.167
- All right. Other techniques?

46:22.167 --> 46:23.458
- Tactics?

46:24.750 --> 46:25.792
Frank?

46:26.833 --> 46:29.958
- There's a common misconception
that most women climax
from penetrative sex,

46:29.958 --> 46:31.958
but statistics show
that 75% of women

46:31.958 --> 46:33.958
can't achieve orgasm
from penetration alone.

46:33.958 --> 46:37.125
Stimulating the clitoris
and other erogenous zones is key.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.208
- Damn.

46:38.208 --> 46:40.333
- And how does one locate said e-zones?

46:40.333 --> 46:43.792
- My cousin said that it's best to think
of your body like a game of Twister

46:43.792 --> 46:45.708
and eventually you'll find the spot.

46:45.708 --> 46:49.292
- Avery, look at me.
Your body is a Costco, okay?

46:49.292 --> 46:51.083
You're trying
all these different samples, right?

46:51.083 --> 46:54.292
You're trying all these different samples.
Oop! Uh-oh. You found the one.

46:54.292 --> 46:56.750
- Okay, but where
are the sample booths located?

46:56.750 --> 46:58.833
- Avery, I cannot tell you everything.
Jesus.

46:58.833 --> 47:01.583
- If I may, the G depends
largely on the individual,

47:01.583 --> 47:03.500
but there are a certain number
of other erogenous zones

47:03.500 --> 47:05.792
that occur across genders
and sexual preferences,

47:05.792 --> 47:09.208
including toes, neck, ear, butt,
behind the knees, elbows.

47:09.208 --> 47:10.542
The partner-pleasure approaches.

47:10.542 --> 47:13.167
The rock-and-roll, the surf's up,
the double-action revolver,

47:13.167 --> 47:15.583
the Spock, the reverse Spock,
the devil's advocate.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.750
I'll email you a list later.
- Damn!

47:17.750 --> 47:19.458
- Oh, no, no.

47:19.458 --> 47:21.875
- Why does pleasing women
gotta be so complicated?

47:21.875 --> 47:22.875
- I can orgasm.

47:24.417 --> 47:26.167
Right here, right now.

47:29.542 --> 47:31.792
- If I did that, I'd be suspended.

47:31.792 --> 47:33.125
I would be suspended!

47:33.125 --> 47:36.625
- Oh, my God, Troy, you so will be.
Okay, just take it down or take it out.

47:36.625 --> 47:38.375
- Uh, Ms. Russell?
- Yeah, baby.

47:38.375 --> 47:39.875
- Hi, mama. Uh...

47:39.875 --> 47:41.625
Let's say Avery needs to solve for C.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.792
- Ooh, participation! Yes!
[snaps fingers]

47:43.792 --> 47:45.500
- But doesn't Avery also need
to solve for G?

47:45.500 --> 47:47.083
Isn't G the super proof?

47:47.083 --> 47:48.750
- But to solve for C and G,

47:48.750 --> 47:50.875
should she maybe also solve for A too?

47:50.875 --> 47:52.083
- Ooh!
- Whoa, whoa!

47:52.083 --> 47:54.333
- Excuse me, some of us
like to solve for A.

47:54.333 --> 47:56.708
- Oh, for sure, A is great, guys.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.875
- I love you, Ms. Russell.
Everyone loves a pinkie.

47:59.958 --> 48:02.417
Everybody.
- What about B squared?

48:02.417 --> 48:04.250
- Oh, my God, loves B squared,

48:04.250 --> 48:06.417
but we save that for our boy quadratic

48:06.417 --> 48:09.000
when B squared is on top of 2A.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.542
- Yeah, she is!

48:10.542 --> 48:12.917
- You know, I do really love
the triangle angle sum theorem,

48:12.917 --> 48:15.333
because we get
the all-powerful isosceles.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.875
- Mm, preach!

48:18.125 --> 48:19.500
- Ooh!
MS. RUSSELL: Avery.

48:20.083 --> 48:23.542
- Let's say movement occurs
at the intersection of the angles.

48:24.333 --> 48:26.125
How would we solve for G?

48:26.125 --> 48:28.375
- We're talking magnitude, huh? Okay.

48:28.958 --> 48:32.917
We're going to need a vector that
starts at D and goes deep into G.

48:32.917 --> 48:33.833
- Yeah, we do.

48:33.833 --> 48:36.083
- Now, it doesn't matter how big
this vector is or how long,

48:36.083 --> 48:37.375
what matters is the angle, okay?

48:37.375 --> 48:38.500
MARLA: The angle!

48:38.500 --> 48:41.375
- Marla? You good there, boo?

- No.

49:33.750 --> 49:35.875

you know.

49:35.875 --> 49:38.250
It's the chemistry plus the geometry.

49:38.250 --> 49:40.292
You solve for G,
you trigger a dopamine receptor

49:40.292 --> 49:42.333
so then the dopamine floods your body
in chemical ecstasy.

49:42.333 --> 49:45.375

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
<i>29% of women ages 16 to 17</i>

52:34.000 --> 52:35.917
<i>which meant that</i>
<i>without even having sex,</i>

52:35.917 --> 52:37.167
<i>I was already in the top third</i>

52:37.167 --> 52:39.083

52:39.083 --> 52:40.500

52:45.292 --> 52:47.042
- Yeah, real good.

52:47.667 --> 52:48.792
Thanks, buddy.

52:50.917 --> 52:52.167
- You bet.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.167
Buddy.

52:57.833 --> 52:59.167
- Larson?

52:59.167 --> 53:00.292
- Yeah.

53:00.292 --> 53:03.417
- So, when you have sex,
is it like this, just more involved?

53:04.375 --> 53:06.417
- I haven't had sex.

53:06.417 --> 53:07.708
- But you've had girlfriends.

53:08.958 --> 53:10.667
Girls like you.

53:10.667 --> 53:12.375
- But that doesn't mean I've had sex.

53:12.375 --> 53:15.208
I... I'm waiting for the right person.

53:15.208 --> 53:18.208
- But then how do you...
I mean, how do you know so much?

53:19.375 --> 53:20.542
- I don't.

53:23.542 --> 53:24.917
With you...

53:26.333 --> 53:28.667
everything just feels right, I guess.

53:46.625 --> 53:48.500
- Hmm! Whoa, whoa!

53:48.500 --> 53:50.000
Ah, back it up.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.958
- What?
- Uh, we're not doing that.

53:51.958 --> 53:54.042
- I thought you wanted
to give everything a test run.

53:54.042 --> 53:55.458
- Not that.

53:55.458 --> 53:56.875
- Okay.

53:56.875 --> 53:59.917
Okay, s-sorry, I just... I thought that...

53:59.917 --> 54:02.833
- Well, then you weren't
thinking with your brain, Larson.

54:02.833 --> 54:06.292
Well, you just launched a harpoon
without tying the rope off.

54:06.292 --> 54:07.167
- I'll tie it off.

54:07.167 --> 54:10.208
I have several ropes: ribbed ropes,
organic ropes, prelubed ropes...

54:10.208 --> 54:12.292
- Okay, reel it in, Skipper.

54:13.083 --> 54:15.500
- But... you want to?

54:17.250 --> 54:18.375
Gilligan?

54:19.667 --> 54:22.875
- Okay, first of all,
I am clearly Professor Roy Hinkley...

54:23.667 --> 54:26.083
and that was never part of the plan.

54:26.708 --> 54:28.833
Our dynamic needs to remain
strictly professional

54:28.833 --> 54:30.667
for the sake of the experiment.

54:35.250 --> 54:36.375
[Larson sighs]

54:44.583 --> 54:46.750
- You know, my hypothesis...

54:46.750 --> 54:48.875
- Which was null and void.
- By you.

54:50.292 --> 54:52.875
But I think...

54:53.792 --> 54:55.208
love leads to sex

54:55.208 --> 54:58.167
and sex leads to love
and that's how you get chemistry.

54:59.417 --> 55:00.625
It's intertwined.

55:03.083 --> 55:04.292
- Wait, hold on.

55:04.292 --> 55:06.167
Let me explain the chemistry to you.

55:06.167 --> 55:08.417
So, even prolonged eye contact

55:08.417 --> 55:10.542
sends signals to your brain
to release dopamine--

55:10.542 --> 55:11.625
- Forget the chemicals.

55:12.750 --> 55:16.042
I'm saying love and sex are interwoven.

AVERY: <i>No, love has nothing to do</i>

56:35.500 --> 56:36.500
- Oop.
- Yeah.

56:36.500 --> 56:39.500
I saw that there was an exhibit
at the science museum

56:39.500 --> 56:41.333
on bioluminescence.

56:41.333 --> 56:44.083
It's only here for another week,
so you wanna go tonight?

56:44.083 --> 56:46.292
- Oh, I caught that opening weekend.

56:47.167 --> 56:49.208
Besides, I have STEMCON tomorrow.

56:49.208 --> 56:51.500
- Right, yeah, that's why,
you know, I thought

56:51.500 --> 56:54.125
maybe we could do something fun
before you go.

56:54.125 --> 56:57.125
- Well, it's the night before the big day.

56:57.125 --> 56:59.625

56:59.625 --> 57:02.667
but I appreciate your assistance
and support,

57:02.667 --> 57:05.750
and, um, I'll see you when
I get back with all the details.

57:08.667 --> 57:10.750
- Avery, every, everything that we did...

57:13.125 --> 57:14.667
how did it make you feel?

57:14.667 --> 57:16.208
- Um...

57:16.208 --> 57:18.208
amazing. [laughs]

57:22.292 --> 57:23.917

57:24.792 --> 57:28.083
- I'm in the top third
of the third percentile now?

57:28.083 --> 57:30.542
- Did anything else change for you?

57:30.542 --> 57:32.833
- Come on, I gotta get back to my prep.

57:32.833 --> 57:35.667
- So that's it, if we're not doing
your experiment, we can't hang?

57:35.667 --> 57:39.292
- Larson, this is my prom, remember?

57:40.000 --> 57:43.500
I mean, like any teen girl,
it's rightfully consuming my thoughts.

57:43.500 --> 57:46.000
- I get it, I get it.
Um...

57:47.333 --> 57:48.833

57:48.833 --> 57:52.792

Larson, it's not that I don't
feel something for you.

1:15:32.458 --> 1:15:33.625
Okay?

1:15:33.625 --> 1:15:36.042
Look, I... I do.

1:15:36.042 --> 1:15:39.375
I feel more than I've ever felt
for a person, and...

1:15:39.375 --> 1:15:42.167
if I had known that I was hurting you,
I never would have--

1:15:42.167 --> 1:15:43.250
- Would have what?

1:15:44.708 --> 1:15:46.458
- The experiment.

1:15:47.250 --> 1:15:48.958
But it wasn't for nothing.

1:15:48.958 --> 1:15:52.167
Because I learned how much
I truly care about you.

1:15:52.167 --> 1:15:54.000
- Avery, you were right.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.375
You're the crocodile.

1:15:56.583 --> 1:15:58.750
But the crocodile can live alone
in that swamp.

1:15:59.292 --> 1:16:01.458
And that is okay.

1:16:01.458 --> 1:16:04.583
'Cause we need people like you
who are gonna change that swamp

1:16:04.583 --> 1:16:07.667
with their achievements
and discoveries and...

1:16:07.667 --> 1:16:11.375
but we need birds like me
who are gonna love them

1:16:11.375 --> 1:16:13.792
for being exactly that.

1:16:14.750 --> 1:16:18.583
But for that symbiosis
to work in the world...

1:16:22.375 --> 1:16:24.875
the bird really needs
to go fly with other birds.

1:16:34.417 --> 1:16:35.708
AVERY: Larson, wait!

1:16:40.333 --> 1:16:41.708

1:16:42.208 --> 1:16:45.625

- Yeah. Let's go to prom.

1:16:47.125 --> 1:16:48.333

1:16:49.167 --> 1:16:50.792
- Why?

1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:56.208

of overhyped, superfluous--

1:16:56.208 --> 1:16:57.583
- No, you were right, okay?

1:16:57.583 --> 1:17:00.208
We never did any
of the fun high school stuff.

1:17:02.792 --> 1:17:05.500
- I don't wanna go. I'm over it.

1:17:06.250 --> 1:17:09.500

1:17:25.875 --> 1:17:27.167

1:17:31.917 --> 1:17:33.333

1:17:33.333 --> 1:17:35.583
- Well, I'll walk with you.
- I'm good.

1:17:35.583 --> 1:17:38.167

in the same way, but...

1:17:40.750 --> 1:17:42.208

1:17:42.208 --> 1:17:44.083

I didn't realize that I was hurting him.
I failed him.

1:19:02.250 --> 1:19:06.708
- Didn't Einstein fail a bunch of times
before he got it right?

1:19:06.708 --> 1:19:10.875
- That is an exhausted anecdote,
overused by underachievers.

1:19:10.875 --> 1:19:14.083
- You kids are overly worried
about getting good at the sex stuff.

1:19:14.083 --> 1:19:15.875
That's the easy part.

1:19:15.875 --> 1:19:18.625
It's the relationship that takes practice.

1:19:18.625 --> 1:19:20.667
- How much practice?

1:19:20.667 --> 1:19:25.167
Because I don't think I ever want
to feel like this again.

Is there any saving of friendship

1:19:39.292 --> 1:19:40.667
- Sometimes.

1:19:42.375 --> 1:19:46.083
And sometimes a person or friendship
is just part of the journey

1:26:47.625 --> 1:26:50.250
and we both know you don't think--
do things you're not-- Sorry.

1:26:50.250 --> 1:26:54.417
- I'm willing to let you out on parole if
you return to your test position... to...

1:26:54.417 --> 1:26:55.542
Fuckin'...

1:26:55.542 --> 1:26:59.333
[imitating rewinding audio]
AVERY: Fuck. I'm sorry.

1:26:59.333 --> 1:27:00.458
[crew laughing]

1:27:00.458 --> 1:27:01.667
Combo.

1:27:01.667 --> 1:27:03.083
DIRECTOR: Oh, that's cool.

1:27:03.083 --> 1:27:05.500
- Spock.
- [laughing] Very nice, Spock.

1:27:05.500 --> 1:27:08.625
- Reverse Spock.
WOMAN: Reverse Spock! [laughing]

1:27:08.625 --> 1:27:09.667
- Can I just go for it?

1:27:09.667 --> 1:27:11.750
The rock star, the surf's up,
the devil's advocate,

1:27:11.750 --> 1:27:14.542
the Spock, the reverse Spock,
the scissors beats paper,

1:27:14.542 --> 1:27:16.125
the sideways dancing man.

1:27:17.708 --> 1:27:19.958
Today's episode is brought to you
by the letter G.

1:27:19.958 --> 1:27:23.292
What's up, G?
I'll email you a list.

1:27:23.292 --> 1:27:26.375
[laughter, indistinct shouting]

1:27:26.375 --> 1:27:28.500
- Oh, my God,
I can't believe it's working!

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.417
- There's a microphone under there.
[laughing]

1:27:32.417 --> 1:27:37.250
[kids speaking nonsense, laughing]

1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:44.250
- Do you know, Deb's batteries
are all in her vibrators, so...

1:27:44.250 --> 1:27:46.292
do you think she's gonna take those out
and put it in the remote?

1:27:46.292 --> 1:27:47.458
I don't think so.

1:27:47.458 --> 1:27:49.500
[crew laughing]

1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:52.792
- Piña Colada. Such a complex flavor.

1:27:52.792 --> 1:27:54.375
- Tastes like sunscreen.

1:27:55.250 --> 1:27:57.708
I licked it again, what is wrong with me?

1:27:57.708 --> 1:28:00.333
- Even Hemingway fucked it up
on the first go.

1:28:00.333 --> 1:28:02.208
Cut yourself-- Oh, I said "fuck."

1:28:02.208 --> 1:28:04.250
Is this a fuck production?

1:28:04.250 --> 1:28:07.375
- Sexual intimacy is
something to be gained.

1:28:07.958 --> 1:28:09.500
KIM: That's beautiful, sweetheart.

1:28:12.042 --> 1:28:14.833
- Why are you so far away from me?
I have a short arm.

1:28:14.833 --> 1:28:17.583
- Uggh! Uggh! Uggh!

1:28:17.583 --> 1:28:18.708
Ohh!

1:28:18.708 --> 1:28:20.917
Uggh!

1:28:20.917 --> 1:28:22.500
DIRECTOR: Good timing.

1:28:22.500 --> 1:28:24.375
- That got really close that time.

1:28:24.375 --> 1:28:26.208
- Yeah. It looked good though.
- I'm really sorry.

1:28:26.208 --> 1:28:28.500
- Were you not entertained?

1:28:29.417 --> 1:28:31.500
So now while you are here...

1:28:32.458 --> 1:28:34.042
fuckin' love...

1:28:34.042 --> 1:28:35.167
[crew laughing]

1:28:35.167 --> 1:28:36.958
- Okay, so we'll follow the same protocol

1:28:36.958 --> 1:28:38.625
as all-ov-our previous experiments--

1:28:38.625 --> 1:28:39.917
- [laughs] Oh, yeah?

1:28:39.917 --> 1:28:41.125
- I'm sorry.

1:28:41.125 --> 1:28:42.583
- Oh, yeah?

1:28:42.583 --> 1:28:44.500
[laughing]

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:47.167
Say it again.
[mimicking] "As all-ov-our..."

1:28:47.167 --> 1:28:50.417
Ha, ha!
Sorry. Blooper reel.

1:28:50.417 --> 1:28:52.125
- I think it went well.
- Pretty good.

1:28:52.125 --> 1:28:53.625
- It didn't feel good,
but I think it was good.

1:28:53.625 --> 1:28:54.875
- Yes.
- Yes.

1:28:54.875 --> 1:28:56.208
[crew laughing]

1:28:56.208 --> 1:28:57.583
