<i>Previously on New Girl...</i>

00:02.214 --> 00:03.626
We're at a wedding together.

00:03.646 --> 00:05.774
Guys, guys, shut and
listen to me... it's Cece.

00:05.809 --> 00:06.713
She doesn't want to get married.

00:06.748 --> 00:09.351
I'm sorry, everyone,
but I can't do this.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.320
What I want is to be
with someone else.

00:11.354 --> 00:13.344
Are you in love with her
or are you in love with me?

00:13.379 --> 00:14.753
You have to decide.

00:16.024 --> 00:18.794
We tried.
We had one night.

00:18.828 --> 00:20.250
Okay, what happened
with Jess?

00:20.282 --> 00:21.239
We called it.

00:21.274 --> 00:23.232
Yeah, when things get messy
you just run away.

00:23.266 --> 00:25.501
I know you think
we should call it.

00:25.535 --> 00:28.570
(Sniffles) But I don't want
to give up on this.

00:45.688 --> 00:47.456
You know what?
I gotta say, Jess,

00:47.490 --> 00:49.291
I really like you.

00:49.325 --> 00:51.293
- I really, really like you.
- I really like you.

00:51.327 --> 00:52.995
I can't believe this is happening.

00:53.029 --> 00:55.697
- It's crazy, but it's happening.
- It's crazy.

00:55.732 --> 00:56.865
I like you so much.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.166
- Yeah, I like you so much.
- Like...

00:58.201 --> 01:00.035
- Yeah.
- I'm just...

01:00.069 --> 01:02.304
- What?
- I'm in. You know?

01:02.338 --> 01:03.639
I'm...

01:03.673 --> 01:05.474
- I'm just all in.
- I'm all in.

01:05.507 --> 01:06.675
I'm, like, weirdly all in.

01:06.709 --> 01:07.976
- Hey, Nick...
- What?

01:08.011 --> 01:09.311
Pull over.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.080
(Jess giggling)

01:12.115 --> 01:13.181
NICK:
Well, that was fun.

01:13.216 --> 01:14.349
(Laughing)

01:14.384 --> 01:15.651
We finally broke in the Volvo.

01:15.685 --> 01:18.086
(Giggling)
Oh, my.

01:22.859 --> 01:24.560
What's next?
What do we do now?

01:24.594 --> 01:27.529
I'm really fighting the urge
to buy you a lobster dinner.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.367
Do we just go home?

01:37.640 --> 01:39.708
(Both chuckle weakly)

01:41.578 --> 01:44.196
You know, I mean, just
how is it actually gonna work?

01:44.231 --> 01:45.581
We've only been
dating for 30 minutes

01:45.615 --> 01:47.349
and we're already living together.

01:47.383 --> 01:49.351
What if you get tired of me,
and you have nowhere to go

01:49.385 --> 01:51.787
because we're roommates, and
so you have to sleep in your car...

01:51.821 --> 01:53.388
Hey. Stop.
That's not gonna happen.

01:53.423 --> 01:54.790
I've wanted this for so long.

01:54.824 --> 01:55.891
I don't want anything
to go wrong.

01:55.925 --> 01:57.526
(Phone chirps)

01:57.560 --> 02:00.462
Oh, it's Schmidt.
He's freaking out about Cece.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.064
He doesn't need to reach you
all the time.

02:02.098 --> 02:03.699
You know what? You're right.
I'm gonna ignore it for now.

02:03.733 --> 02:05.267
It's all about us right now.

02:05.301 --> 02:07.402
(Phone chimes)
Hmm.

02:07.437 --> 02:08.537
It's Schmidt.

02:08.571 --> 02:10.104
He wants to know
where you are.

02:10.139 --> 02:11.707
He texted you to ask
where I am?

02:11.741 --> 02:12.941
(Phone chimes)
That's... ugh.

02:12.976 --> 02:14.776
He just texted
I'm a bad friend.

02:14.811 --> 02:16.111
You know what that is?

02:16.145 --> 02:17.412
Either male genitalia,

02:17.447 --> 02:19.481
or a really big thumbs down.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.950
- Why would he send me male genitalia?
- Why can't he talk to Winston?

02:21.985 --> 02:24.229
Well, without me, they get so weird
and they fight all the time.

02:24.264 --> 02:25.520
This is what I'm talk...
(Phone chimes)

02:25.555 --> 02:27.723
How many times a day
does Schmidt text you?

02:27.757 --> 02:28.857
I don't know, I'll just say 40.

02:28.891 --> 02:30.559
How...
(Phone chimes)

02:30.593 --> 02:32.686
See, this is what I'm talking about.

02:32.721 --> 02:34.881
I feel like we need time alone...
(phone chimes)

02:34.916 --> 02:36.587
so we can figure out what this is.

02:36.622 --> 02:38.141
(Phone chimes)
Yes. This is what I want.

02:38.168 --> 02:40.602
I want to be with you alone,
without anybody else.

02:40.637 --> 02:41.737
Just you and...

02:41.771 --> 02:42.838
Where have you been?

02:42.872 --> 02:44.673
I'm having a major life crisis,

02:44.707 --> 02:46.408
and you guys are, what?
Just driving around,

02:46.442 --> 02:48.283
French-kissing each other
like a couple Dutch hookers?

02:48.318 --> 02:49.311
What is that, Nick?
Is that a hickey?

02:49.345 --> 02:51.313
- Disgusting!
- Hey, you guys.

02:51.347 --> 02:53.315
Um, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

02:53.349 --> 02:55.317
Now, I know everyone's
going through a lot,

02:55.351 --> 02:57.986
but I think it is time
for me to start a puzzle.

02:58.021 --> 02:58.787
No, it isn't.

02:58.821 --> 03:00.589
What is going on with you two?
Are you, like, a couple now?

03:00.623 --> 03:02.257
Have you thought
any of this through?

03:02.291 --> 03:03.659
Nick, please help me, okay?

03:03.693 --> 03:04.960
Stop being so selfish
and just help me.

03:04.994 --> 03:06.695
Okay, you know what?
Give me one minute,

03:06.729 --> 03:08.587
- I'll be right inside.
- We'll be right in.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.831
Yeah, we just got to
figure something out.

03:09.866 --> 03:11.867
All right! Thanks, man.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.702
- The gang's back.
- We'll be right in.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.203
Yeah, good-bye, guys.
We love you guys.

Well, Winston,

03:26.515 --> 03:29.351
after 25 unanswered text messages
to Nick and Jess this morning,

03:29.385 --> 03:31.286
I finally received a response.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.320
A smiley face.

03:32.355 --> 03:34.864
This leaves us with one choice...

03:34.899 --> 03:37.312
- To become best friends.
- Huh? Yeah, fine.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.794

03:43.833 --> 03:45.133
unfortunately for you,
your dignity.

03:45.168 --> 03:47.469
- Yeah, fine.
- Winston, what can I do for you?

03:47.503 --> 03:49.471
Don't talk to me that much,
never lie to me,

03:49.505 --> 03:51.173
and never,
ever touch my puzzle.

03:51.207 --> 03:52.808
Winston, do we... (chuckles)
do we think now

03:52.842 --> 03:54.676
is really the right time
to be starting a puzzle?

03:54.711 --> 03:55.911
(Laughs)
I'm great at puzzles.

03:55.945 --> 03:59.347
You're a born puzzler, Winston,
sure, um, but...

03:59.382 --> 04:01.183
don't you agree that sometimes,

04:01.217 --> 04:03.185
when you start puzzles,
you get a little bit weird?

04:03.219 --> 04:04.920
And, I don't know, intense?

04:04.954 --> 04:06.221

04:20.236 --> 04:21.670
It's a Japanese garden!

04:21.704 --> 04:24.205
Schmidt, calm down.
What is your problem?

04:25.541 --> 04:27.342
Two women
are in love with me.

04:27.376 --> 04:29.010
The problem is, is I'm
in love with both of them.

04:29.045 --> 04:30.612
Okay, looks like you're
gonna have to choose.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.614
Cece and I,
we have this connection.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.083
You know, it's physical...
it's unhealthy.

04:35.118 --> 04:36.585
Look, I don't want to
get too graphic with you,

04:36.619 --> 04:38.120
but I'm not just the plug
with her.

04:38.154 --> 04:39.788
I'm also a socket.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.057
God... okay, fine.

04:42.091 --> 04:43.625
- Schmidt, choose Cece.
- Yeah, but...

04:43.659 --> 04:46.361
- I was dating Elizabeth first, so...
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.395 --> 04:48.797
Wait a minute... Winston...
I was dating Elizabeth first.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.398
- You want to know what I think?
- No, I don't. Done.

04:50.433 --> 04:51.900
Decided. Ha!

04:51.934 --> 04:53.101
Cece, out.

04:53.136 --> 04:54.302
I was dating Elizabeth first.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.638
- My man! Way to talk that out.
- Yeah.

04:56.672 --> 04:57.906

that you guys

but I just...
I'm gonna be candid.

I've been up for 24 hours.
I have to return all of these gifts.

05:25.668 --> 05:27.135

"This girl must be wearing sneakers

05:42.451 --> 05:45.253
"with shoelaces, and th-those
shoelaces must be tied together,

05:45.288 --> 05:48.423

is straight trippin', yo."

06:01.971 --> 06:03.638
Sh... She took it.

06:05.007 --> 06:07.542
In the marketplace of ideas,
where...

06:07.577 --> 06:09.311
culture is king,

06:09.345 --> 06:11.613
and data moves faster
than people,

06:11.647 --> 06:13.882

come from turnkey solutions...

No... no.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.957
As if.

06:21.991 --> 06:23.658
Of course I picked you.
It wasn't even close.

06:23.693 --> 06:26.044
Come here,
you crazy white girl.

06:29.198 --> 06:31.046
There it is.

06:31.081 --> 06:32.033
Poor Cece.

06:32.068 --> 06:34.469
Uh, yeah, okay.

06:35.738 --> 06:38.039

06:44.680 --> 06:47.615

07:08.559 --> 07:09.859

Yeah, I should try him again.

07:46.396 --> 07:48.564

- Let's stay here.
- We're totally out of money.

- We got this great setup.
- No, this is not gonna last long.

07:56.406 --> 07:58.140
It's not gonna last long.
It isn't.

07:58.175 --> 08:00.076

08:16.560 --> 08:19.161
And you're Paradise Jess, right?

08:19.196 --> 08:20.563
We can make food and just...

08:25.269 --> 08:26.769
- All in.
- All in.

08:28.572 --> 08:30.573
(Whispering):
It don't work like that.

08:30.607 --> 08:31.841
If you... uh...

08:31.875 --> 08:32.909
(Scoffs)

08:32.943 --> 08:34.910
Hey, man, how'd she take it?

08:34.945 --> 08:36.445
Devastated. I'm sure
glad that's settled.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.712
Hey, man, I'm gonna go shower.

08:37.748 --> 08:38.948
I'm proud of you.

08:38.982 --> 08:41.116
I know it must have been tough.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.452
Hey, Schmidt, who do you call
if puzzle pieces are broken?

08:43.486 --> 08:44.754
Oh. Hey, Winston.

08:44.788 --> 08:46.022
Is, uh, is Schmidt home?

08:46.056 --> 08:47.390
Cece.

08:47.424 --> 08:49.492
Oh, my goodness. Hi.

08:50.494 --> 08:51.727
Do you need a hug?

08:51.762 --> 08:53.396
All right.

08:53.430 --> 08:55.097
(Laughs, grunts)

08:55.132 --> 08:57.900
(Winston humming a jazzy tune)

09:00.070 --> 09:02.104
Is Schmidt even here, Winston?

09:03.507 --> 09:05.408
Yeah. Yeah, he's in the shower.

09:05.442 --> 09:07.410
Um... Cece, I just want to say,

09:07.444 --> 09:10.313
on my end,
that I am so, so sorry.

09:10.347 --> 09:11.581
CECE:
Sorry about what?

09:11.615 --> 09:13.249
You know, uh... Elizabeth.

09:13.283 --> 09:14.884
Well, what about Elizabeth?

09:14.918 --> 09:17.286
He made love to her.

09:17.321 --> 09:20.089
Winston made love to Elizabeth.

09:23.660 --> 09:24.961
After I chose you,

09:24.995 --> 09:27.129
Winston was all too quick,

09:27.164 --> 09:28.798
in Elizabeth's vulnerable state,

09:28.832 --> 09:31.167
to rush in there and
just get his jollies off.

09:31.201 --> 09:34.770
His sweaty, disgusting jollies.

09:34.805 --> 09:35.771
Seriously?

09:35.806 --> 09:38.335
I mean, she must have just been
so upset and hurt...

09:38.373 --> 09:40.076
I didn't even know
you were interested in her.

09:40.110 --> 09:41.444
SCHMIDT:
Tell her what you did, Winston,

09:41.478 --> 09:42.912
and give her the short version,

09:42.946 --> 09:44.780
which you did not give to Elizabeth.

09:44.815 --> 09:45.781
Wha...?

09:45.816 --> 09:47.783
What I did... um...

09:47.818 --> 09:51.287
Okay, well, I drove over there...

09:51.989 --> 09:53.789
to seduce her.

09:54.825 --> 09:57.426
And I seduced her...

09:57.461 --> 09:59.462
two and a half times.

10:01.565 --> 10:04.433
Puzzle me this, then,
Winston...

10:04.468 --> 10:05.868
How do you live with yourself?

10:05.902 --> 10:08.638
I have a bit of a hard time believing

10:08.672 --> 10:10.806
that Winston would do this.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.341
SCHMIDT: Well, then, you obviously
don't know Winston,

10:12.376 --> 10:15.444
'cause he's a sick,
disgusting human being.

10:15.479 --> 10:18.381
Just this morning he asked me
for a pair of your underpants.

10:18.415 --> 10:20.449
- Winston?
- Hmm?

10:20.484 --> 10:23.185
Is that true?

10:25.822 --> 10:27.056
Yes.

10:28.392 --> 10:32.662
I needed your underwear to...

10:32.696 --> 10:35.698
sew into my underwear.

10:35.732 --> 10:37.900
Oh... my...

10:37.934 --> 10:39.068
God.

10:39.102 --> 10:40.703
That is disgusting!
You are a pervert!

10:40.737 --> 10:42.571
SCHMIDT:
Oh, I'm so sorry, Cece.

10:42.606 --> 10:44.340
Just wait in the car.
You don't have to deal

10:44.374 --> 10:46.842
with this disgusting
trash person, garbage child!

10:46.877 --> 10:48.277
(Door slams)

10:51.815 --> 10:52.982
You're upset.

10:53.016 --> 10:54.016
As you should be.

10:54.051 --> 10:55.251
Oh, but that was great, man.

10:55.285 --> 10:56.719
How long as this been
going on, man?

10:56.753 --> 10:57.920
Four days.

10:57.954 --> 10:59.155
Four days,
and you didn't tell me?

10:59.189 --> 11:00.322
Come on, Schmidt!

11:00.357 --> 11:01.724
I said, "Don't lie to me."

11:01.758 --> 11:03.192
I'm sorry. All right?

11:03.226 --> 11:05.194
I love both of these women
and I couldn't decide.

11:05.228 --> 11:06.429
I needed to buy some more time.

11:06.463 --> 11:08.030
Cece thinks I'm wearing
her panties right now!

11:08.065 --> 11:09.865
Well, that's on you, man!
You freaked out super hard!

11:09.900 --> 11:12.568
You-you kidding me?
That's so weird.

11:12.602 --> 11:14.837
Sewing people's panties
into underpants.

11:14.871 --> 11:16.005
Look, we're not best friends,
Schmidt.

11:16.039 --> 11:18.741
As a matter of fact,
we're not friends at all...

11:18.775 --> 11:20.009
until you fix this.

11:20.043 --> 11:22.745
Okay, all right, look.

11:22.779 --> 11:24.046
Winston, I'm sorry, man.

11:24.081 --> 11:25.614
W-Winston, you've been

11:25.649 --> 11:27.116
working on this puzzle
for quite some time now.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.919
You realize a lot of those puzzle pieces
are upside down, right?

11:29.953 --> 11:31.120
It's just they're cardboard color.

11:31.154 --> 11:34.056
Is that an almond that you have
inserted into one of the pieces?

11:34.091 --> 11:36.225
Are you just eating them, or
are you using them as pieces?

11:36.259 --> 11:37.359
You know that's an almond,
right?

11:37.394 --> 11:38.728
(Screaming)

11:38.762 --> 11:40.262
Schmidt, come here!

11:46.269 --> 11:47.236
Free cocktails.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.672
- No way!
- Yeah, fitting right in.

11:49.706 --> 11:52.341
- Oh, my God.
- What?

11:52.375 --> 11:53.476
Security guard. Freeze.

11:53.510 --> 11:54.643
NICK: Okay, don't freeze.
That looks weird.

11:54.678 --> 11:56.178
Did he notice you?
Of course he noticed you.

11:56.213 --> 11:58.047
You're the prettiest girl
on the damn beach.

11:58.081 --> 12:00.816
Shut up. We need one of
these bracelets right away, Jess.

12:00.851 --> 12:02.585
- Bracelet.
- Yeah.

12:02.619 --> 12:04.487
Oh, hey! Hey...

12:04.521 --> 12:06.889
Hey, pal.
That's a really cool bracelet.

12:06.923 --> 12:08.624
Do you think I could try it on?

12:08.658 --> 12:11.551
- No.
- Listen to me, okay?

12:11.586 --> 12:13.062
Will you lean in here for
a second and listen to me?

12:13.096 --> 12:15.731
One day, you're gonna meet a girl,
you're gonna really like her,

12:15.766 --> 12:17.233
and you're gonna want
to give her everything,

12:17.267 --> 12:18.968
but you won't be able
to afford it

12:19.002 --> 12:20.302
because your life's kind of
in shambles

12:20.337 --> 12:21.771
and you don't have money.

12:21.805 --> 12:24.840
Look at you, kid, you
got a great-looking face.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.475
I don't know, you might
have a tough go of it.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.144
What do I know?
Just promise me this...

12:28.178 --> 12:30.346
Promise me you're gonna try
to enjoy your life as much

12:30.380 --> 12:33.149
as you can, 'cause one day
you're gonna be dead, and, you know.

12:33.183 --> 12:34.617
Can I have your bracelet,
for real?

12:34.651 --> 12:35.985
No.

12:36.019 --> 12:39.288
If you don't give me the bracelet,
I'm gonna strangle you to death.

12:41.291 --> 12:42.992
- Thanks, buddy.
- Not cool.

12:43.026 --> 12:45.461
But it worked, okay? We got the bracelet,
so now we're back in action.

12:45.495 --> 12:46.495
- <i>Hola.</i>
- JESS: <i>Hola.</i>

12:46.530 --> 12:48.030
Can I see your bracelets,
<i>por favor</i> ?

12:48.064 --> 12:49.365
Yes.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.133
Looks pretty on her, right?

12:51.168 --> 12:52.668
<i>Señor?</i>

12:54.037 --> 12:55.104
- Run!
- JESS: No!

12:55.138 --> 12:56.438
(Guard speaks Spanish)

12:56.473 --> 12:58.707
I don't speak Spanish, you snake!

12:58.742 --> 13:01.010
What are you gonna do?
I'm in the ocean now!

13:01.044 --> 13:03.078
I'm in international waters!

13:04.548 --> 13:05.881
I've got a shell.

13:05.916 --> 13:07.349
Let's just go.
Let's just get out of here.

13:07.384 --> 13:08.851
- Point Break style?
- No, no, no!

13:08.885 --> 13:10.319
I will Point Break style
this moment!

13:10.353 --> 13:12.021
Nick, let's go!

13:12.055 --> 13:13.522
Nick, stop!

13:14.357 --> 13:15.991
Aah! Ow!

13:16.026 --> 13:18.294
(Nick sobbing)

13:18.328 --> 13:19.395
Ow, that hurt!

13:19.429 --> 13:21.497
Wait!
Where are you taking him?!

13:21.531 --> 13:23.566
- Jail.
- JESS: Aah!

13:27.658 --> 13:32.028
(Winston singing quietly)

13:32.062 --> 13:33.195
Truce, okay?

13:35.632 --> 13:39.769
Winston, please, come on...
Talk to me. I...

13:39.803 --> 13:41.771
I need a friend right now.

13:41.805 --> 13:43.539
I love both of these women,

13:43.574 --> 13:47.043
and I can't lose them,
and I can't... hurt them.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.178
And we made a pact!

13:49.212 --> 13:50.713
No. You lied to me.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.014
You're a liar.

13:52.049 --> 13:54.016
Okay, well, then would you
like some truth, Winston?

13:54.051 --> 13:55.418
Here's some truth for you, okay?

13:55.452 --> 13:56.686
You're terrible at puzzles.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.588
Worst I've ever seen by a mile.

13:58.622 --> 14:00.122
What, do you have fly vision?

14:00.157 --> 14:01.257
Look at this puzzle.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.692
It's ages six and up.

14:02.726 --> 14:04.026
You are up, Winston.

14:04.061 --> 14:06.062
- You are way up!
- You want to say that to my face?

14:06.096 --> 14:07.730
This is a corner piece, Winston!

14:07.764 --> 14:09.966
How do you not see that?
What are you, blind?!

14:10.000 --> 14:12.134
I'm so sorry... actually,
a blind man could feel

14:12.169 --> 14:14.704
the smooth edges
of a corner piece!

14:14.738 --> 14:16.939
You are making me so mad.

14:16.974 --> 14:19.609
- Ooh, you are making me so mad.
- Oh, yeah?

14:19.643 --> 14:20.493
You're making me...

14:20.530 --> 14:21.960
How am I making you...?
Am I making you...?

14:21.998 --> 14:23.540
- Yes, you're making me mad.
- What you want to do?

14:23.582 --> 14:25.060
What are you doing?

14:25.097 --> 14:27.706
Which way are you going?
What is happening?

14:27.785 --> 14:29.986
- Ow!
- What did you do?

14:30.020 --> 14:33.222
Don't mess with me, man.
I'm legit. I'm legit, dude.

14:33.256 --> 14:35.057
- I'm getting very dizzy.
- You coming at me, son?

14:35.092 --> 14:37.560
I need all the cash you have
and Nick's passport!

14:39.170 --> 14:41.150
- What'd you say? What?
- Nick's in trouble?

14:41.965 --> 14:44.100
SCHMIDT: What are we doing?
Nick is in jail?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.002
WINSTON: Nick went to jail
before me?

14:46.036 --> 14:47.069
(Winston laughing)

14:47.104 --> 14:48.838
(Overlapping arguing)

14:48.872 --> 14:49.905
(Bell dinging)

14:49.940 --> 14:50.940
Hey, stop it! Stop it!

14:50.974 --> 14:53.643
This is not the time for fighting.
Nick is in a Mexican jail.

14:53.677 --> 14:55.678
We don't know this country.
We don't know their laws.

14:55.712 --> 14:57.179
We don't know
how to get him out.

14:57.214 --> 14:59.248
I just hope he found somebody

14:59.282 --> 15:01.250
who can protect him
and take care of him.

15:01.284 --> 15:02.785
What, you hope
he's somebody's bitch?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.021
- No, like a mentor.
- He'd never be picked as a bitch.

15:05.055 --> 15:06.956
Nick is very attractive.
He can be a bitch.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.024
A sissy, perhaps, but a bitch?

15:08.058 --> 15:09.992
- He can be a bitch.
- He cannot be a bitch.

15:10.027 --> 15:11.260
- My God, what's a sissy?
- Are you insane?

15:11.294 --> 15:13.374
- A chubby <i>gringo</i> ?
- Stop it!

15:13.664 --> 15:15.865
Nick is my bitch.

15:15.899 --> 15:17.166
(Bell dings)

15:17.200 --> 15:18.634
<i>Hola, señores, señora.</i>

15:18.669 --> 15:20.002
Hi. Um, we have some questions.

15:20.037 --> 15:22.538
Jess, I got this. I know how
to handle these people.

15:24.207 --> 15:25.408
Is this for me?

15:25.442 --> 15:26.976
That's for you to send
your kids to college,

15:27.010 --> 15:28.878
or for you to send
some fun up your nose.

15:28.912 --> 15:30.212
SCHMIDT:
Your choice, bro.

15:30.247 --> 15:33.382
Don't worry. We're looking
for our friend Nick Miller...

15:33.417 --> 15:36.552
if he's still alive, and his head...
if it's separate.

15:36.586 --> 15:39.622
You know who you should
talk to? Manny.

15:39.656 --> 15:40.956
- Manny.
- Manny.

15:40.991 --> 15:43.959
(Quietly):
Talk to Julio.

15:43.994 --> 15:45.394
- Julio.
- Julio.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.164
Talk to Brad.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.865
I don't really feel right about this.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.834
Oh, Jess, you're so naive.
It's a game.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.337
We're working our way up the ladder.
Brad is clearly the kingpin.

15:57.074 --> 15:58.774
Thanks so much.

16:00.077 --> 16:01.310
(Jess sighs)

16:01.344 --> 16:03.546
Okay, that didn't work.
Next idea.

16:03.580 --> 16:06.348
Well... There are no
next ideas, Schmidt!

16:06.383 --> 16:09.418
We're out of money!
I need to just find somebody.

16:09.453 --> 16:11.087
- Oh, just find somebody?
- Yes.

16:11.121 --> 16:12.655
Right, Jess, 'cause
the streets down here

16:12.689 --> 16:15.410
- they run red with hospitality.
- Hey! Hey!

16:15.445 --> 16:17.727
Hi. Sorry.
I met you yesterday.

16:17.761 --> 16:19.562
You arrested a man
named Nick Miller.

16:19.596 --> 16:20.696
You got money?

16:20.731 --> 16:21.997
Money.
No, we don't have any money.

16:22.032 --> 16:23.666
But wait, wait, wait!

16:23.700 --> 16:25.868
What about his shoes?
Any interest in his shoes?

16:25.902 --> 16:28.237
There's no way you're getting
these damn shoes, okay?

16:28.271 --> 16:29.438
These are my favorite
brown shoes.

16:29.473 --> 16:31.207
And besides, this is
all your fault, Schmidt.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.743
Nick's body's being traded
like cigarettes right now!

16:33.777 --> 16:35.410
Winston, those shoes are
not brown... they're green.

16:35.445 --> 16:37.279
- What the hell you talking about, man?
- Those shoes are green.

16:37.314 --> 16:40.015
You guys are idiots, all right?
They're as brown as money.

16:40.050 --> 16:42.885
- What color is Kermit the Frog?
- Brown. It's a brown frog.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.020
Winston, you're color-blind, dude.

16:45.055 --> 16:46.722
What? I am not color...
I am not color-blind.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.190
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

16:48.225 --> 16:50.259
Sir, I'm so sorry.
We have no money.

16:50.293 --> 16:52.128
We don't even have money
for gas.

16:52.162 --> 16:53.596
Oh, you got a car.

16:53.630 --> 16:55.598
Want to trade?

16:57.667 --> 16:59.702
Hey.

16:59.736 --> 17:03.405
Oh, my God, I thought he
was taking you to jail.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.074
No, it's resort jail,
and it's not so bad.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.541
They let me watch Ugly Betty.

17:06.576 --> 17:08.144
Here, I brought you your passport.

17:08.178 --> 17:09.744
- Winston, enough!
- Enough for me!

17:09.780 --> 17:11.046
Oh, Nicholas, thank goodness
you're alive.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.481
You brought them?
(Rapid, overlapping chatter)

17:12.516 --> 17:14.550
I needed their help.

17:14.584 --> 17:16.012
- Winston does not get me at all.
- What?

17:16.048 --> 17:18.287
And, plus, he's color-blind,
which basically makes him crippled.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.489
Please, tell me... these shoes
are brown, right?

17:20.523 --> 17:21.991
- Those shoes are green.
- They're definitely green.

17:22.025 --> 17:23.726
Okay, you both are crazy.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.127
Winston!

17:25.162 --> 17:28.430
If you think those shoes are brown,
what color do you think you are?

17:30.700 --> 17:32.101
Jess, I can't do this.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.503
Do you really want to wake up
to this every morning?

17:34.538 --> 17:36.672
It doesn't matter,
as long as I wake up next to you.

17:36.706 --> 17:38.574
I got an idea.
Let's move to Mexico.

17:38.608 --> 17:40.242
- What?
- Yeah!

17:40.277 --> 17:42.077
- Hell no!
- Nicolas, I need you.

17:42.112 --> 17:44.280
If you leave, then I'm with Winston,
and I can't handle that.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.614
You and me, we work here.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.349
If we go back to the loft,
we're not gonna make it.

17:47.384 --> 17:48.984
Yes, we are.
We are gonna make it.

17:49.019 --> 17:51.420
You won't. He's 100% right.
You will not.

17:51.454 --> 17:53.255
I'm not ready to lose you.

17:53.290 --> 17:56.425
I just got you, Jess.

17:56.459 --> 17:58.127
And I'm not letting you go.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.129
So...

18:00.163 --> 18:01.664
I'm all in.

18:03.434 --> 18:06.168
I'm shredding this passport.
I'm not leaving Mexico.

18:06.203 --> 18:08.437
- Oh, no, you are not, sir!
- No, no, no, wait, wait!

18:08.471 --> 18:10.806
I will put myself in that shredder
before you put your passport in there!

18:10.841 --> 18:12.208
WINSTON:
Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, switch!

18:12.242 --> 18:14.176
- Put yourself in there.
- Stop! Stop, Nick!

18:14.211 --> 18:15.978
I will shred my ear!
I'll do it!

18:16.012 --> 18:17.980
- Your ear could go in!
- I will shred myself!

18:18.014 --> 18:19.348
I will shred myself
in the shredder.

18:19.382 --> 18:20.349
- Get serious!
- (Jess yells)

18:20.383 --> 18:21.617
Stop.

18:21.651 --> 18:22.651
Listen to me.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.654
We're a family.

18:26.923 --> 18:28.457
You can't choose who you love.

18:28.491 --> 18:29.692
Sometimes they choose you.

18:29.726 --> 18:31.393
And sometimes, it's just because

18:31.428 --> 18:34.496
you got a really great deal
on Craigslist.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.833
(Laughing): I got a really
great deal on Craigslist.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.101
I got all of you.

18:41.438 --> 18:45.107
There is no "us" without
Schmidt and Winston.

18:46.610 --> 18:48.477
It's gonna be really, really hard.

18:48.511 --> 18:50.079
But so what, Nick?

18:50.113 --> 18:52.014
So what?

18:52.048 --> 18:54.516
I believe in us.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.452
I'm all in.

18:57.921 --> 18:59.521
I really want to go home.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.057
(Giggles)

19:02.092 --> 19:04.226
Come on, man,
let's just go home.

19:04.261 --> 19:06.161
(Sighs)

19:06.196 --> 19:08.364
You know what?
I love you guys.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.199
- WINSTON: Okay.
- Let's go home.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.267
(Laughing):
Great.

19:11.301 --> 19:12.268
(Both laughing)

19:12.302 --> 19:13.335
(Whirring)

19:13.370 --> 19:14.336
Oh, my God!

19:14.371 --> 19:15.704
No!

19:15.739 --> 19:17.106
(All shouting at once)

19:17.140 --> 19:18.741
Get it out! Get it out!

19:18.775 --> 19:19.775
(Shouting)

19:19.809 --> 19:21.677
(Screams)
Unplug it, Nick!

19:21.711 --> 19:23.679
The shredder shredded it, bro.

19:23.713 --> 19:26.448
WINSTON: No, no, no,
no, guys, we're fine.

19:27.617 --> 19:29.518
I can work with this.

19:29.552 --> 19:30.853
(Chuckles)

19:33.105 --> 19:36.039
SCHMIDT: Okay, everybody.
Just be cool. Act normal.

19:37.341 --> 19:38.375
U.S. citizens?

19:38.409 --> 19:40.644
Passports, please.

19:41.679 --> 19:42.846
What is this?

19:45.650 --> 19:48.885
Sir, my name is Winston Bishop.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.789
I'm a color-blind American citizen,

19:52.824 --> 19:54.391
and I can't do puzzles.

19:54.425 --> 19:56.726
Now let us go home.

19:56.761 --> 20:00.030
It says
"Unatered Stites of Amurica."

20:00.865 --> 20:02.766
(Nick sighs)

20:02.800 --> 20:04.000
(Sighs)

20:04.035 --> 20:05.969
(Laughs)

20:06.003 --> 20:07.237
You ready?

20:07.271 --> 20:09.139
(Laughing)

20:09.173 --> 20:10.674
(Grunting)

20:10.708 --> 20:11.942
(Laughs)

20:11.976 --> 20:13.343
Hey, I got you something, actually.

20:13.377 --> 20:15.812
I mean,
I stole it from a kid, but...

20:18.649 --> 20:20.951
(Sighs)

20:21.886 --> 20:23.118
We can do this.

20:23.153 --> 20:24.833
-Yeah, we can do this.
- Yeah.

20:25.289 --> 20:26.590
All right.

20:26.624 --> 20:28.325
- Yeah.
- Here we go, huh?

20:29.578 --> 20:30.486
It's locked.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.542
I think somebody
accidentally locked this.

20:31.577 --> 20:33.130
- Where's your key?
- I don't carry a key.

20:33.164 --> 20:36.379
- You don't carry a key?
- No, I don't carry a...

20:36.414 --> 20:38.535
Why would I carry a key?
There's always somebody home!

20:38.569 --> 20:39.536
And I know how to jimmy the...

20:39.570 --> 20:41.571
Mmm, my God...

20:42.974 --> 20:44.341
JESS:
I like you so much.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.642
I like you, too.
And I'll start carrying a key.

20:45.676 --> 20:46.910
Okay, I'll carry a key for you.

20:48.846 --> 20:51.057
For the love of God, Winston,
please just go unlock the door.

20:51.092 --> 20:53.454
- This is so weird.
- NICK: Yeah...

20:53.718 --> 20:57.053
<i>Sayonara</i>, masturbation,
for the rest of my life.

20:57.388 --> 20:59.289
Hey, Cece, it's Schmidt.

20:59.323 --> 21:00.590
Hi.

21:00.624 --> 21:02.158
You want me to come over
tonight?

21:02.193 --> 21:03.626
I think I can make that work.

21:03.661 --> 21:05.962
Uh, can you give me,
like, five minutes?

21:05.996 --> 21:08.498
Great. Um... ooh, actually,
could you hold on one second?

21:09.900 --> 21:12.469
(Laughs)
Hi, Elizabeth, my darling.

21:12.503 --> 21:13.703
How are you?

21:13.737 --> 21:15.839
Uh, tonight?
You want to... tonight.

21:15.873 --> 21:18.341
Um, could you just give me one second
so I can check my calendar?

21:18.375 --> 21:19.642
That'd be great.

21:23.347 --> 21:25.849
I just checked it, and, uh...

21:25.883 --> 21:28.151
it looks like there's
a slight problem. Um...

21:28.185 --> 21:29.385
