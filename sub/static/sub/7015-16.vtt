WEBVTT

00:04.022 --> 00:05.668
Hey, Fez, you know
what was awesome?

00:05.696 --> 00:07.681
That time
you rode that tree.

00:08.256 --> 00:09.923
How did he ride a tree?

00:10.323 --> 00:12.986
Oh, he climbed it,
Kelso cut it down.

00:14.489 --> 00:16.602
You guys have
a million stories

00:16.638 --> 00:19.080
and you know each other so well.
It's like you have your own language.

00:19.115 --> 00:21.050
I don't even understand
half the things you say.

00:21.696 --> 00:25.817
If you understand anything that Fez says,
you're the only one. Burn!

00:27.966 --> 00:32.911
Oh, Kelso can't understand me? Now I know
how it feels to be a book. Ah-burn!

00:37.278 --> 00:40.824
See? Man, I wanna burn somebody
so I can be part of the gang.

00:40.860 --> 00:41.799
This gang?

00:42.198 --> 00:45.897
Angie, the only reason this gang formed
was because no one would let us into their gang.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.386
We're like the chess club,

00:49.560 --> 00:50.894
but better looking and...

00:51.505 --> 00:52.409
dumber.

00:56.683 --> 00:57.411
Hey.

00:57.632 --> 00:58.595
Hey.
Um,

00:59.158 --> 01:01.965
so was there somethin' you wanted to say to me
the other day at the record store?

01:02.949 --> 01:06.542
Oh, yeah.
I wanted to talk to you about...

01:07.458 --> 01:08.327
ABBA.

01:10.628 --> 01:11.426
ABBA?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.278
No, you said you wanted
to talk about us.

01:15.923 --> 01:16.663
Right.

01:17.203 --> 01:19.843
Our feelings
about ABBA.

01:21.709 --> 01:22.555
You know what?

01:22.848 --> 01:25.725
Good. Great. Believe me, I don't
wanna talk about us, either.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.732
Come on, Angie. We were supposed
to open the record store,

01:28.767 --> 01:30.458
oh, about seven hours ago.

01:33.746 --> 01:37.244
You told me you wanted to tell Hyde
that you still love him and you wanted him back.

01:37.279 --> 01:39.604
Yeah, well, it's obvious
he doesn't want me back.

01:39.639 --> 01:42.211
So you better not tell him what
I said, or I'll be humiliated.

01:43.256 --> 01:44.829
My lips are a seal's.

01:47.847 --> 01:51.017
Don't you mean
that your lips are sealed?

01:52.004 --> 01:53.542
I'm not hearing
the difference.

01:55.374 --> 01:58.481
Great. Anyways, you guys,
I have huge news.

01:58.787 --> 02:01.792
You know how Point Place cable
has that public access channel?

02:01.828 --> 02:05.385
Yeah! Donna, didn't your dad do, like,
a belly dancing show there?

02:08.990 --> 02:11.357
He guest-hosted.
Shut up.

02:12.272 --> 02:13.036
Anyways,

02:13.200 --> 02:14.985
I'm gonna have
my own show!

02:15.008 --> 02:16.769
Just like Mary Tyler Moore.

02:16.805 --> 02:20.832
Oh, except I won't stop for commercials 'cause
no one really wants to take a break from me.

02:22.358 --> 02:25.528
I don't know. That week you were
in Florida.. That was a nice, quiet week.

02:34.103 --> 02:36.322
Have you been
in bed all day?

02:36.932 --> 02:37.719
Yeah, I have.

02:39.856 --> 02:43.275
I've been reading the Jack Kerouac
classic "On The Road."

02:43.804 --> 02:45.295
See, as I see it,

02:45.553 --> 02:46.986
why get out of bed

02:47.796 --> 02:50.438
when you can read about people
who got outta bed?

02:52.598 --> 02:56.695
You have got to be the laziest
non-communist I've ever met.

02:58.433 --> 03:02.601
And you are about to read
a book that my foot wrote.

03:03.352 --> 03:06.061
It's called
"On The Road To In Your Ass."

03:08.562 --> 03:10.851
Okay, now, Red, please, let's

03:10.898 --> 03:13.620
hold off on the cursing
until happy hour.

03:15.557 --> 03:18.093
This year-off crap
better come to an end

03:18.140 --> 03:19.864
or I'm gonna put
you in a box

03:19.899 --> 03:21.648
and mail ya to
the marines.

03:23.269 --> 03:24.783
Oh, don't worry, honey.

03:24.807 --> 03:27.543
Your father's too cheap
to mail something that heavy.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.943
He just wants you to have
some direction, and so do I.

03:31.978 --> 03:36.287
And you are in luck because
I got the new issue of "Cosmo."

03:37.142 --> 03:41.016
Oh. Well, I'm just not sure I need
seven new ways to please my man.

03:46.697 --> 03:47.472
No.

03:47.871 --> 03:48.987
No.
Honey,

03:49.034 --> 03:51.863
it's a job aptitude test.
Okay,

03:52.040 --> 03:53.601
question number one:

03:54.200 --> 03:56.572
Do you consider
yourself creative?

03:57.639 --> 03:58.660
- Well...
- Yes!

03:59.623 --> 04:02.335
You were a little
wiz at macaroni art.

04:03.439 --> 04:06.656
Do you prefer to work
alone or with others?

04:07.342 --> 04:08.446
- Alone.
- Nope.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.949
You love people.

04:11.029 --> 04:13.248
Okay, question three:
Do you...

04:13.507 --> 04:14.951
Well, that's easy.

04:16.471 --> 04:19.255
Look, mom, I'm happy
just enjoying my world.

04:19.291 --> 04:23.482
I'm like an explorer I'm exactly
like Christopher Columbus,

04:23.858 --> 04:25.022
except, you know,
I've

04:25.210 --> 04:27.922
I've been incredibly
distracted by television.

04:29.977 --> 04:31.550
Okay! All done.

04:32.349 --> 04:35.217
Now, according
to your answers...

04:38.281 --> 04:40.618
you should be a nurse!

05:19.551 --> 05:21.770
Okay, Fez, since you're
helping me with set dressing,

05:21.805 --> 05:24.585
I want the set to reflect
my sparkling personality.

05:24.609 --> 05:26.053
I want it to say
"Jackie."

05:26.488 --> 05:28.871
Okay, let me see. Maybe some
glitter, a disco ball...

05:28.889 --> 05:31.660
uh-huh. I want a big sign
that says "Jackie."

05:34.619 --> 05:35.875
I hate this room.

05:36.556 --> 05:39.856
It reminds me of my dad dancing around
half-naked with finger cymbals.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.856
Well, my show is
gonna be a news show

05:44.891 --> 05:46.617
all-nude or just topless?

05:49.693 --> 05:51.795
Not nude.. News!

05:51.841 --> 05:53.333
I'm not hearing the difference.

05:55.035 --> 05:58.241
Jackie, how are you gonna tell people
the news if you don't know any news?

05:58.393 --> 06:01.455
I know all the news that's really
important, like

06:01.502 --> 06:05.025
who's got a new car, what store is
having a sale on leggings

06:05.154 --> 06:06.176
and, uh,

06:06.481 --> 06:09.029
and if there'll ever
be peace in the middle-east.

06:11.236 --> 06:13.755
who am I kidding?
No one cares about China.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.982
Hey, Eric, can I have
some of your fries?

06:23.005 --> 06:23.710
Sure.

06:23.757 --> 06:25.823
Well, I don't
want any. Burn!

06:28.794 --> 06:32.388
I think you're confusing
a burn with just talking.

06:36.486 --> 06:37.872
Eric, can I have some fries?

06:37.919 --> 06:39.128
Yeah, help yourself.

06:42.296 --> 06:43.564
Burn!

06:46.652 --> 06:50.947
Yeah, um, I knew you were gonna
do that so I spit in 'em.  Burn!

06:55.880 --> 06:56.866
Totally.

06:56.948 --> 06:58.087
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:58.393 --> 07:00.811
You ate his spit!
Burn!

07:05.743 --> 07:09.108
Uh, that's a piggyback burn.
We don't do that.

07:10.952 --> 07:11.926
Come on Angie.

07:11.950 --> 07:13.934
You've gotta do inventory
in the store room

07:13.969 --> 07:16.118
and I gotta go
sleep behind a box.

07:17.119 --> 07:19.338
Man, you want to, uh,
catch a movie or something?

07:19.373 --> 07:21.792
Nah. I gotta go down
to the police academy.

07:21.827 --> 07:23.905
They're gonna teach me
what prisoners feel like.

07:23.941 --> 07:27.322
Guys are gonna handcuff me
to a flagpole for a few hours.

07:29.117 --> 07:31.864
It's not in the curriculum,
but they say it's required.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.876
Hey, uh...

07:40.640 --> 07:43.399
I'm sorry, are you reading
the new "Mighty Spectaculus"?

07:43.446 --> 07:44.749
Yeah. You a fan?

07:45.642 --> 07:48.530
When trouble arrives
by car or bus, we summon...

07:48.565 --> 07:51.993
- The mighty spectaculus!
- The mighty spectaculus!

07:54.635 --> 07:55.986
They call me
Eric Forman.

07:56.795 --> 07:58.861
Stew Bailey.
No relation to beetle.

08:01.175 --> 08:02.619
Hey, Stew, I mean,
if you're interested,

08:02.658 --> 08:06.317
they're havin'a spectaculus spectacular
down at the atomic comic book nook.

08:07.918 --> 08:08.952
You're probably..

08:09.104 --> 08:10.877
You probably have to get
back to work or something.

08:11.136 --> 08:13.308
I don't have to be anywhere.
I don't have a job.

08:13.590 --> 08:14.811
How old are you?

08:15.093 --> 08:18.204
Well, let's just say I'm two years
older than professor Reveng-O.

08:19.613 --> 08:20.764
36.

08:23.323 --> 08:24.768
S-so then, Stew,

08:25.498 --> 08:26.883
what do you do all day?

08:27.471 --> 08:28.633
You're lookin' at it.

08:30.934 --> 08:32.634
Oh, we're gonna
be good friends.

08:40.971 --> 08:41.640
Fez,

08:42.446 --> 08:45.217
Jackie's show is about to start.
Aren't you supposed to be helping her?

08:45.252 --> 08:49.268
She asked me to make a giant sign with her
name on it, so I said, "You got it baby!"

08:49.303 --> 08:51.604
so then I went
to get some ice cream

08:51.639 --> 08:54.551
and then I went to play
some space invaders

08:54.586 --> 08:57.075
and, um, and then I came
here to watch the show.

09:00.011 --> 09:03.545
I could never be on TV,
unless it was Johnny Carson

09:03.578 --> 09:08.403
Because I have a very funny story about
a cheeto that looked just like Jesus.

09:16.708 --> 09:17.729
So, Fez...

09:19.162 --> 09:21.486
You've been hanging out
a lot lately with Jackie.

09:21.827 --> 09:25.205
Any idea what she wanted to talk to me about
at the record store the other day?

09:25.381 --> 09:29.033
Um, I don't know. I was there.
I mean, I-I wasn't there. I, uh...

09:31.146 --> 09:33.093
I was, uh, I was away...

09:35.782 --> 09:36.709
on business.

09:41.443 --> 09:45.987
Well, if she wanted to get back together,
that's something I wouldn't mind knowing.

09:46.151 --> 09:48.723
So why don't you just go
ahead and spill the beans?

09:49.967 --> 09:50.742
Beans?

09:52.348 --> 09:53.992
What beans?

09:54.520 --> 09:57.268
The only beans
are in your head,

09:57.303 --> 09:59.252
You little bean-head!

10:03.916 --> 10:04.796
Anyway..

10:06.323 --> 10:10.608
I opened the bag, and there he was:
the beard and everything.

10:13.068 --> 10:13.937
Oh, Oh!

10:14.512 --> 10:16.086
Jackie's
about to start.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.105
Okay, Jackie,
are you ready?

10:18.270 --> 10:20.817
Yeah, of course. I've got
this thing's down path.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.117
Okay, so after
the weather report,

10:23.152 --> 10:25.301
I'm gonna get into the problem
with the spirit squad.

10:25.465 --> 10:26.604
They're all fat.

10:26.909 --> 10:29.398
That's my commentary.
I'm anti-fat.

10:30.056 --> 10:30.723
Okay.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.940
Ten seconds until you're on the air,
offending thousands of people.

10:36.512 --> 10:37.897
Thousands of people?

10:38.061 --> 10:40.838
In 5... 4... 3...

10:47.131 --> 10:48.774
You didn't say 2 or 1.

10:48.951 --> 10:50.688
It's because you're on now!

10:51.416 --> 10:52.494
Well, but I'm not...

10:54.877 --> 10:55.981
Hi.

10:57.508 --> 10:59.551
I'm Backie Jurkhart.

10:59.821 --> 11:01.016
Jackie Burkhart!

11:01.063 --> 11:02.308
- What?
- It's your name!

11:02.343 --> 11:04.304
- I know what my name
- you said Backie Jurkhart.

11:04.327 --> 11:05.913
Okay, stop talking
or you're fired!

11:07.108 --> 11:07.942
Fine.

11:08.611 --> 11:09.679
You're on your own.

11:10.654 --> 11:11.488
I'm what?

11:14.893 --> 11:16.055
Oh dear...

11:17.523 --> 11:19.178
She's not so good.

11:21.151 --> 11:23.429
She's sweatin'
like Muhammed Ali

11:27.880 --> 11:29.736
cut to her boobs.

11:31.039 --> 11:32.765
Oh, who's directing
this thing?

11:45.280 --> 11:48.404
Well, guess we can't just sit and talk
about comic books all day.

11:49.082 --> 11:50.796
Let's do some"star wars" trivia. Go.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.074
Oh, I got a stumper.

11:53.226 --> 11:55.493
Who is Luke and
Obi-Wan's nemesis at...

11:55.528 --> 11:57.334
Doctor Evazan.

11:59.095 --> 12:00.774
Man, you're good.

12:01.479 --> 12:03.052
Look, let me ask you a question.

12:03.851 --> 12:05.375
Some people think that

12:05.410 --> 12:08.780
if I keep living, you know,
"without a purpose"

12:08.986 --> 12:10.372
that I'll be all,

12:11.029 --> 12:12.978
I don't know,
unfulfilled and stuff.

12:14.962 --> 12:17.264
Do you ever
feel unfulfilled?

12:18.555 --> 12:21.350
I've seen "Star Wars"
in seven different states.

12:22.371 --> 12:25.436
I even met the midget
that they stuck inside R2-D2.

12:26.827 --> 12:28.835
What could be more
fulfilling than that?

12:30.679 --> 12:31.947
I don't know.

12:33.988 --> 12:35.303
Hey, dorks.

12:35.385 --> 12:38.357
Listen, uh, Angie had
a really rough day at work,

12:38.381 --> 12:42.984
so I'm gonna rub her feet and you might wanna
clear out before I start rubbin' other stuff.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.249
Eric, come over later.
We'll game.

12:46.637 --> 12:48.081
Who was that guy?

12:48.198 --> 12:49.126
That's this guy St..

12:49.149 --> 12:51.098
I don't care! Burn!

12:58.003 --> 13:02.747
Angie, you're cute as a button,
but you burn like a botard.

13:05.624 --> 13:10.307
Look, if you wanna burn someone, you gotta
embarrass them to make other people laugh.

13:10.342 --> 13:14.827
You want to combine the elements
of humiliation and surprise.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.536
Dude, what the hell?

13:20.990 --> 13:22.476
Burn!

13:26.754 --> 13:27.634
Oh, hey.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.088
Jackie, uh,
I saw your show.

13:30.124 --> 13:32.754
It isn't as good
as a lot of other shows.

13:35.243 --> 13:35.865
No.

13:37.072 --> 13:40.313
It was great for people who think
regular TV is too entertaining.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.575
I freaked out.

13:45.010 --> 13:48.505
I mean, the cameras turned on
and I realized I'm completely alone.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.192
I'm alone on TV
and I'm alone in real life.

13:54.153 --> 13:55.644
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

14:02.527 --> 14:03.314
Burn!

14:06.460 --> 14:07.845
Oh, my god!

14:11.681 --> 14:12.456
Uh...

14:13.619 --> 14:18.221
uh, I forgot to tell you the part about you
don't burn someone who's already crying.

14:24.483 --> 14:25.164
Okay,

14:25.633 --> 14:28.299
best side kick..
Robin or Aqualad?

14:28.684 --> 14:29.494
Ooh.

14:29.976 --> 14:32.923
Uh, toughie. Is the villain
they're fighting terrestrial

14:33.064 --> 14:34.062
or Aquatic?

14:35.189 --> 14:39.158
Stewie, you didn't tell me
you were having a friend over.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.938
Eric, this is my mom.

14:48.807 --> 14:50.493
Y-you still live
with your mom?

14:51.479 --> 14:53.299
Oh, she's more
than just my mother.

14:53.346 --> 14:54.814
She's my best friend.

14:57.491 --> 14:59.663
She's your best friend?!

15:01.393 --> 15:02.274
Well,

15:02.309 --> 15:04.387
you're givin' her
a run for her money.

15:06.935 --> 15:08.027
Okay, I gotta go.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.692
Are you sure?

15:09.774 --> 15:14.400
I was about to make sandwiches
in the shape of x-wing fighters.

15:15.598 --> 15:16.608
Uh,

15:16.655 --> 15:19.169
no, really. Well...
no, I gotta go.

15:27.439 --> 15:28.661
What are you doin'?

15:28.801 --> 15:30.845
I'm throwin' out
all my comic books.

15:35.224 --> 15:37.112
I saw my future today and...

15:37.875 --> 15:39.754
well, it's living
with its mother.

15:45.296 --> 15:47.977
Yeah, well, I saw my future
and it sweats.

15:50.126 --> 15:51.288
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

15:51.746 --> 15:52.756
You sweat?

15:54.365 --> 15:56.723
Uh, would you happen to
have a picture, some

15:56.758 --> 15:58.507
tape of this that
I could laugh at?

16:00.198 --> 16:02.594
Eric, I tried to have
my own TV show,

16:02.652 --> 16:03.780
and I failed.

16:04.050 --> 16:07.079
My life is over. I'm not
good enough to be on TV.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.923
No, Jackie...

16:11.670 --> 16:12.844
Okay, come on.

16:13.057 --> 16:14.501
You're good-looking,

16:14.725 --> 16:18.282
you're incredibly superficial
and you lie constantly.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.674
I think you're
perfect for TV.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.103
Do you really think so?

16:27.139 --> 16:27.878
Yeah.

16:28.841 --> 16:29.557
I mean...

16:30.708 --> 16:33.221
Jeez, look, at least you're
doing something with your life.

16:34.483 --> 16:36.455
I have wasted
an entire year.

16:36.502 --> 16:37.900
Eric, let me stop
you right there,

16:38.287 --> 16:41.915
okay? Since you were kind enough to
cheer me up when my spirits were low,

16:42.432 --> 16:43.935
I'm gonna go.
Thanks!

16:54.588 --> 16:56.196
Hey, Forman, let me
ask you a question.

16:56.901 --> 16:58.568
What do you think
about me and Jackie?

16:59.437 --> 17:01.269
Well, man, you
know what I think.

17:01.797 --> 17:03.864
I think that Jackie
is evil incarnate.

17:05.234 --> 17:08.323
I think that if you were to cut
off one of her hands, it would

17:08.358 --> 17:10.319
probably grow back
into another Jackie.

17:13.015 --> 17:15.058
Look, before Jackie,

17:15.667 --> 17:18.486
you were just some
pissed-off guy in my basement.

17:19.977 --> 17:21.291
But with her...

17:23.155 --> 17:24.775
I mean, you seemed
happy, man.

17:25.515 --> 17:26.887
Hey, I was never happy.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.540
I was just less pissed off.

17:32.207 --> 17:32.816
Hyde...

17:35.376 --> 17:38.805
I lied to you when I told you
that I was away on business.

17:43.008 --> 17:43.795
No.

17:48.057 --> 17:48.797
Yes.

17:51.450 --> 17:53.650
And I know what Jackie
wanted to tell you.

17:54.331 --> 17:55.646
She still loves you.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.219
What?

17:57.630 --> 18:00.361
Yeah. She said she was wrong
and that she wanted you back.

18:00.631 --> 18:01.958
She was vulnerable,

18:02.850 --> 18:04.236
so I tried
to french her.

18:07.512 --> 18:08.933
But no-go.

18:15.285 --> 18:16.553
Shouldn't Jackie
be here by now?

18:16.586 --> 18:19.063
Yeah. She's supposed to
go on in, like, a minute.

18:19.345 --> 18:20.989
I don't think
she's gonna show up.

18:21.494 --> 18:22.140
What?

18:24.758 --> 18:28.174
No! But we were gonna do
this whole segment on sluts.

18:29.631 --> 18:31.368
And I was gonna be
the slut expert.

18:31.384 --> 18:33.822
That's the only kind of expert
I'm ever gonna be!

18:35.866 --> 18:38.261
Hey. Jackie, I can't believe
you showed up.

18:38.965 --> 18:40.724
I can't believe i showed up.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.990
What am I doing with my life?

18:43.295 --> 18:45.491
Okay, come on, people.
We got a show to do.

18:45.526 --> 18:47.299
okay.
In 3...

18:50.822 --> 18:51.621
Hi,

18:51.703 --> 18:55.049
I'm Jackie Burkhart, and here's
all the news you need to know.

18:55.085 --> 18:57.128
This just in:
slacks are out.

18:57.175 --> 19:00.004
So, ladies, shave those
legs and put on a skirt!

19:02.141 --> 19:03.103
Up next,

19:03.327 --> 19:07.812
senior correspondent michael Kelso joins me
for a very exciting segment I like to call

19:07.843 --> 19:08.759
"Slut

19:09.076 --> 19:10.109
or not."

19:10.556 --> 19:11.577
Michael, welcome.

19:11.612 --> 19:12.634
Hi, Jackie.

19:13.268 --> 19:14.078
Ladies.

19:15.381 --> 19:16.826
Okay,
let's get started.

19:18.493 --> 19:19.944
Marcy Cavanaugh.

19:20.613 --> 19:21.459
Slut.

19:23.302 --> 19:24.453
Susie Rice.

19:25.580 --> 19:26.423
Slut.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.439
Hey, could you
zoom out a sec?

19:31.965 --> 19:33.797
Ooh, Jenny Keene.

19:34.220 --> 19:37.730
Partly slutty with a chance
of severe sluttiness.

19:42.028 --> 19:43.719
Angie, what the hell?!

19:43.907 --> 19:44.646
Burn?

19:47.159 --> 19:47.957
Burn!

19:50.646 --> 19:51.586
Well,

19:52.231 --> 19:55.507
there you have it, America...
your first televised burn.

19:55.554 --> 19:58.781
Up next, a hard-hitting segment
called "Girls with moustaches."

19:58.816 --> 20:01.176
Don't touch that dial,
sherry papadakis!

20:09.766 --> 20:10.940
Hey, man,
is Jackie around?

20:10.976 --> 20:11.668
Hey.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.876
Yeah, but I thought
you weren't talking to her.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.784
you're gonna make up
with her, aren't you?

20:19.840 --> 20:23.292
Oh, you're gonna tell
her that you love her!

20:24.420 --> 20:27.743
And your little sunglasses
are gonna get all fogged up.

20:29.363 --> 20:31.289
Jackie, there's someone
here to see you.

20:32.850 --> 20:33.578
Hey.

20:34.283 --> 20:36.672
Uh, I thought maybe
we would talk for a minute.

20:36.848 --> 20:38.339
Is it about my show?

20:38.633 --> 20:40.823
'Cause it was awesome!
Steven,

20:41.116 --> 20:44.169
I went on and I did great,
and I did it on my own!

20:44.210 --> 20:47.487
I mean, I've never been more
proud of myself in my entire life.

20:47.678 --> 20:49.744
I'm gonna do
great on my own.

20:50.437 --> 20:52.480
I'm sorry. What did you want
to talk to me about?

20:54.124 --> 20:54.746
Well,

20:54.946 --> 20:55.777
um...

20:59.488 --> 21:02.047
I just wanted to say
congratulations on your show.

21:03.503 --> 21:04.689
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.687
Did you see Michael
with his pants down?

21:11.926 --> 21:12.572
No.

21:14.521 --> 21:16.655
But I don't need
a TV to see that.

21:17.877 --> 21:18.975
Bye.

21:23.977 --> 21:25.409
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

21:25.445 --> 21:29.437
and welcome to the full
half-hour of "Slut or not."

21:29.695 --> 21:33.194
I've got a phone book here and a wealth
of experience with fooling around,

21:33.229 --> 21:34.661
so let's get started.

21:35.178 --> 21:36.666
"Beverly Addison."

21:36.701 --> 21:39.930
I don't know her personally,
but I've heard she has a tattoo.

21:39.954 --> 21:42.149
So congratulations,
Beverly Addison.

21:42.173 --> 21:43.969
You are a slut.

21:45.202 --> 21:47.903
What the hell
happened to this country?

21:49.906 --> 21:53.499
I know Beverly Addison, and
I'm glad somebody finally said it.
