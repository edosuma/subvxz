[narrator] Previously on Hit & Run:

00:07.625 --> 00:11.333
-[Segev] If you have to move to New York--
-I probably won't even get the job.

00:11.416 --> 00:13.291
-You'll get it.
-I'll be back soon.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.333
Hey, Tzion, you take care--

00:17.750 --> 00:20.250
-[Segev] I need your help here, okay?
-Of course.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.916
We got him. The guy who hit Dani.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.791
Rami Shalem,
the gangster from the crime family.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.250
[Segev] There was somewhere there.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.333
What? Who is this?

00:27.416 --> 00:28.958
Sorry, wrong number.

00:30.375 --> 00:31.375
[bones crack]

00:32.166 --> 00:34.625
[Segev] Tali, there was a break-in.
He's dead.

00:34.708 --> 00:35.916
Please hurry.

[pensive music playing]

01:26.125 --> 01:28.125
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:35.875 --> 01:37.541
Why is he handcuffed?

01:38.166 --> 01:40.833
He got mad, acted like a fool.
I had no choice.

01:42.250 --> 01:45.625
[man] We got the call.
Guy told us he'd killed someone.

01:45.708 --> 01:47.291
But when we got here, there was nothing.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.541
[woman] Not even a body.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.250
[man] Maybe he had too much to drink.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.750
If he said he killed someone,
he killed someone.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.041
Treat it like a crime scene.

01:59.833 --> 02:02.500
Call Forensics and block the area.
Keys, please.

02:03.125 --> 02:04.458
[man] Guy had a gun.

02:14.541 --> 02:15.375
[Tali] Hey.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.583
[handcuffs unlocking]

02:24.166 --> 02:25.458
-Let me see.
-I'm okay.

02:29.291 --> 02:30.750
Did you have to fight them?

02:32.250 --> 02:33.583
They don't believe me.

02:33.666 --> 02:36.708
They're patrol cops.
I told them to call Homicide.

02:36.791 --> 02:38.916
-Did you catch his face?
-Yeah.

02:40.833 --> 02:41.833
I don't know him.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.666
I'll go and check for a sec.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.041
-Go ahead.
-Be right back.

02:49.000 --> 02:49.916
Thanks.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.375
[dramatic music playing]

04:00.166 --> 04:02.208
[Boaz] Any other break-ins in the area?

04:04.208 --> 04:05.291
I have no idea.

04:07.833 --> 04:11.166
Did you notice anything suspicious,
anything weird happen lately?

04:13.208 --> 04:14.041
Yeah.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.458
Um...

04:16.625 --> 04:19.833
Yesterday morning,
near my house, there was a car.

04:19.916 --> 04:23.375
-Right when Danielle left for her flight.
-The same guy who attacked you?

04:23.458 --> 04:24.541
No.

04:24.625 --> 04:25.458
No.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.666
Is there any reason
that someone would want to go after you?

04:30.750 --> 04:33.625
I'm a tour guide.
Why would anyone want to hurt me?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.750
You weren't always a tour guide, right?

04:35.833 --> 04:36.708
Boaz.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.500
[Amit] What about Rami Shalem?

04:40.083 --> 04:41.416
You really don't know him?

04:42.666 --> 04:44.708
Why would I know?
I don't mess with guys like that.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.791
What about the wife?

04:53.958 --> 04:55.333
Why would she know him?

04:56.833 --> 04:58.833
[dramatic music playing]

05:01.750 --> 05:04.791
Okay. It appears
we have everything we need, Shapira.

05:05.791 --> 05:08.916
Anything new comes up,
we'll contact you, okay?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.875
Wait, wait, what? That's all?

05:11.541 --> 05:14.708
Until Forensics get back to us
about the gun, yeah.

05:14.791 --> 05:15.916
There's not much we can do.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.458
I have a 12-year-old kid,

05:17.541 --> 05:19.541
and my ex lives in the same moshav.

05:19.625 --> 05:20.958
How am I supposed to protect them?

05:21.041 --> 05:25.250
We can station an officer there.
Maybe that can help you.

05:25.833 --> 05:26.666
All right?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.250
When we get home,
I'll get you something to eat.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.708
I'm not that hungry.

05:45.791 --> 05:46.958
Fine. Still...

05:48.000 --> 05:51.208
you could use a shower. Okay?

06:03.958 --> 06:05.750
I wish I could still call her.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.000
Yeah.

06:12.625 --> 06:15.083
Did you ever manage to track that number?

06:17.208 --> 06:18.375
Not exactly.

06:19.375 --> 06:22.458
Whoever texted her
texted her from a burner phone.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.541
The type you get
from the south of the city.

06:26.541 --> 06:29.625
A burner, really?
Why would anybody contact her like that?

06:30.583 --> 06:31.583
No idea.

06:35.625 --> 06:37.083
Maybe an affair?

06:42.500 --> 06:43.333
No...

06:48.291 --> 06:50.166
I don't know. I really don't know.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.875
We were in love.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.250
Things were good.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.791
People are complicated.

07:12.291 --> 07:13.875
[engine starts]

07:13.958 --> 07:14.833
Go figure.

07:59.750 --> 08:00.583
Dad.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.458
Segev.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.583
Shira called.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.041
You're holding in there?

08:22.208 --> 08:23.666
Yeah, I just need a coffee.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.958
-Get clean. I'll make it.
-Okay.

08:28.000 --> 08:28.833
Thanks.

08:36.541 --> 08:37.583
[door locks]

08:38.958 --> 08:40.958
[dramatic music playing]

09:33.250 --> 09:35.041
-[Segev] Hey.
-Hi.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.083
-[groans]
-What? It hurts?

09:40.125 --> 09:40.958
Yeah.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.333
Give it to me.

09:48.666 --> 09:51.666
Your back, your feet, your legs...

09:52.916 --> 09:53.916
how much pain?

09:55.541 --> 09:56.500
Is it worth it?

09:57.833 --> 09:58.791
I don't know.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.125
When you love something so much,
you just...

10:03.666 --> 10:04.708
go for it.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.666
Does that sound crazy?

10:08.250 --> 10:09.083
No.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.166
-This cold?
-Yes.

10:13.250 --> 10:16.166
-And if I put it there or here...
-No, don't! [laughing]

10:45.125 --> 10:46.166
I love you.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
I love you.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.166
I checked every morgue there is.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.000
No unidentified bodies
in the past 24 hours.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.208
I don't know what to say.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.791
Listen, I know he's your cousin,

11:13.875 --> 11:15.583
and I'm sure he's a good guy,

11:15.666 --> 11:17.750
but where's the blood?

11:17.833 --> 11:20.041
What about the struggle
he said happened there?

11:20.125 --> 11:22.416
All I got was a few broken pots.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.291
No, uh... No DNA.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.291
No prints at all.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.000
Someone could have cleaned up there.

11:28.583 --> 11:29.416
Listen...

11:33.125 --> 11:37.250
I ran a background check, okay?
And there's a few things that, you know...

11:37.333 --> 11:38.375
Like what?

11:39.083 --> 11:41.041
The guy was deported from Mexico.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.875
Did time there for four years.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.125
Besides, he downed
a whole bottle of whiskey.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.166
Tali, we're looking into it, okay?

11:50.250 --> 11:51.291
But, come on,

11:52.125 --> 11:54.583
how much of your time
would you invest in this?

11:55.500 --> 11:56.916
Boaz, he's not like that.

12:03.458 --> 12:07.000
[Amit on video] All right, Rami,
tell me everything from the beginning.

12:07.708 --> 12:08.541
Go ahead.

12:09.041 --> 12:10.166
[Rami] I told you.

12:10.666 --> 12:12.208
I had grilled cheese,

12:12.291 --> 12:13.750
took my kids to school.

12:14.708 --> 12:17.291
Then I met some friends
for coffee at Pasha.

12:18.291 --> 12:22.000
When I was done, my car was gone.
It was stolen by some fucker.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.958
Gym bag, backpack...

12:24.041 --> 12:25.625
My kid's iPad was there.

12:25.708 --> 12:27.166
[Amit] Then what?

12:27.250 --> 12:29.583
[Rami] And then I called a cab,
I went home.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.875
What is this, story time?
Come on, do your jobs, for fuck's sake!

12:32.958 --> 12:34.333
You're the police, no?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.000
[whispers indistinctly]

12:51.250 --> 12:52.875
[Syd] I know you're not hungry,

12:52.958 --> 12:54.875
but you need to eat something.

12:54.958 --> 12:56.875
[Avram] Still haven't heard
from her parents?

12:57.583 --> 12:58.708
About their flight?

13:01.208 --> 13:02.041
No.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.791
What am I supposed to tell the rabbi?

13:06.458 --> 13:09.000
Abba, he's not going to start
without her parents.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.625
They'll be here, don't worry.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.250
Fine. Okay.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.083
Here.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.333
This is from her locker at Batsheva.

13:47.791 --> 13:49.583
Avram, are you eating with us?

13:49.666 --> 13:51.500
[Avram] Oh, no, no, no, thank you.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.875
I have a few more calls to make
before I head out. Thank you.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.958
[dramatic music playing]

14:02.583 --> 14:04.083
Can you sit for a sec?

14:15.166 --> 14:16.750
"Why are you ignoring me?"

14:18.041 --> 14:19.250
"I have to see you."

14:20.958 --> 14:22.291
Do you know who sent them?

14:23.166 --> 14:26.291
Whoever it was called her many times
the day she died.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.500
I'm sorry, Segev, I don't know.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.541
[cell phone ringing]

15:08.666 --> 15:09.500
Hello.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.166
[Martin] Segev.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.333
Martin.

15:12.416 --> 15:14.125
Are you at the airport?

15:14.208 --> 15:15.250
No, no.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.666
No, that's why I'm calling.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.583
We were packed and ready to go,

15:19.666 --> 15:21.291
and Marcia fainted.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.208
Turns out she's got pneumonia.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.500
Probably the stress of all this.

15:25.583 --> 15:26.750
She's at Mount Sinai.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.500
That's terrible news.

15:28.583 --> 15:29.791
We're devastated.

15:30.458 --> 15:34.500
You know that Dani has to be buried
within the next 24 hours, right?

15:34.583 --> 15:37.208
Can't imagine
Dani being buried without us,

15:37.291 --> 15:38.666
but the doctors are...

15:39.958 --> 15:44.208
concerned about Marcia,
and I don't feel I can leave her.

15:45.041 --> 15:46.833
Of course. Um...

15:49.083 --> 15:51.375
Take care of her.
Let me know how she's doing.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.000
I don't know what to say.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.375
I'm sorry.

15:56.458 --> 15:57.791
I know. Uh...

15:57.875 --> 15:59.333
I don't know what to say either.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.458
When Marcia feels better,

16:01.541 --> 16:04.291
we'll probably do a small memorial

16:04.375 --> 16:06.625
in New York
with her family and friends from here.

16:06.708 --> 16:09.541
-We'd love for you to be there.
-Of course.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.333

she would change my life.

-No, it's not there.

23:19.125 --> 23:20.041
I checked.

Check again. I'm sure it's there.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.083
You okay?

23:47.500 --> 23:48.708
-Really good.
-Really good, huh?

23:48.791 --> 23:50.958
Here, drink that.
I'll go deal with the pastries.

23:51.041 --> 23:51.875
Amazing.

23:58.416 --> 24:02.416
So Forensics tested for prints and DNA
on the Glock that you gave me

24:02.500 --> 24:04.208
-And...
-And?

24:04.291 --> 24:06.625
...nothing. Only your prints there.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.375
Well, sure, he had gloves on.

24:10.041 --> 24:12.708
Actually, I'm not so sure
it was Rami in the car.

24:14.458 --> 24:16.583
This whole story's strange.

24:16.666 --> 24:19.375
[Ella] Dad, I checked.
I can't find that album.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.291
Sorry.

24:33.750 --> 24:34.583
Boaz,

24:35.458 --> 24:37.708
listen for a sec, I have this idea.

24:37.791 --> 24:39.125
Get ahold of Rami's wife.

24:39.208 --> 24:41.458
Ask her if the kid's iPad had GPS.

24:44.166 --> 24:45.041
Syd.

24:49.291 --> 24:50.375
We need to talk.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.458
What is it? What's wrong?

24:54.541 --> 24:57.291
Who was the guy at the funeral
with the sunglasses and the jacket?

24:57.375 --> 24:59.000
I saw you looking at him.

24:59.083 --> 25:02.500
It's obvious you know each other.
I don't know him. But you do.

25:02.583 --> 25:04.500
[dramatic music playing]

25:08.125 --> 25:09.458
His name is Assaf.

25:10.750 --> 25:11.750
Assaf what?

25:11.833 --> 25:13.291
I don't remember, I'm sorry.

25:14.708 --> 25:15.708
Don't lie to me.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.791
Who was he?

25:20.500 --> 25:22.333
He's a businessman.

25:22.416 --> 25:23.833
Got a thing for dancers.

25:23.916 --> 25:25.833
There's a lot of guys like that.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.208
He hit on the girls
and practically lived at Hashoftim.

25:29.291 --> 25:30.791
What do you mean, Hashoftim?

25:30.875 --> 25:32.833
This bar we used to hang out at.

25:33.708 --> 25:35.250
He knew Danielle?

25:39.041 --> 25:39.875
Yeah.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.083
How well?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.791
They dated a little.

25:45.875 --> 25:47.875
Before she met you. It wasn't a big deal.

25:47.958 --> 25:49.708
Well, not to her, anyway.

25:52.708 --> 25:53.666
But to him?

25:54.666 --> 25:59.333
Honestly, after she stopped dating him,
he became a little obsessed.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.083
Why didn't she tell me?

26:01.166 --> 26:03.708
Probably thought you'd kill him
if you knew.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.708
Please don't hate me.
You two are my best friends here.

26:08.791 --> 26:10.875
I cannot stand to think
that I fucked this up.

26:10.958 --> 26:11.958
I don't hate you.

26:17.708 --> 26:19.708
[pop music playing over speakers]

26:24.291 --> 26:26.541
Didn't expect to see you here tonight.

26:29.083 --> 26:29.958
Want a drink?

26:31.375 --> 26:32.708
He's asking about you.

26:34.833 --> 26:35.916
Who's asking what?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.750
Segev saw you there today.

26:47.041 --> 26:48.041
Why did you come?

26:48.750 --> 26:49.916
It was stupid.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.375
I have the right to grieve, don't I?

26:58.750 --> 27:00.291
I loved her too, you know.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.708
The tour guide can go fuck himself.

27:09.541 --> 27:11.583
I wouldn't mess with him, Assaf.

27:25.375 --> 27:29.041
[Boaz] We tracked the kid's iPad,
found the car at this garage on Allenby.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.208
[Gal] That's all the footage we have.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.500
Gal, stop.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.291
That's the vehicle.

27:43.666 --> 27:45.958
Let's see the camera on the roof
at the same time.

27:57.583 --> 27:58.500
Fuck.

27:58.958 --> 28:01.291
-What, you know them?
-No.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.916
But I'm pretty sure
none of them are Rami Shalem.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.833
[pop music playing over speakers]

28:40.625 --> 28:41.625
You're Assaf?

28:42.375 --> 28:43.208
Yeah.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.375
What were you doing around my house?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.208
-I was just leaving.
-Huh?

28:48.916 --> 28:50.291
What was your plan, huh?

28:50.375 --> 28:52.750
Talk to her? Murder her? What?

28:53.625 --> 28:55.750
I know you're going through a hard time,

28:55.833 --> 28:58.041
but as I said, I was waiting for someone.

28:58.583 --> 29:01.500
-So if you don't mind...
-You were stalking her.

29:01.583 --> 29:02.833
Leave me alone, will you?

29:02.916 --> 29:03.916
[gun cocks]

29:05.000 --> 29:06.458
You slept with her?

29:09.000 --> 29:12.125
-I don't know you, man.
-What happened there?

29:15.625 --> 29:16.541
Yeah.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.125
We slept together.

29:21.125 --> 29:22.916
We dated a few years back.

29:24.208 --> 29:26.250
We broke up, and she married you.

29:27.708 --> 29:28.541
All right?

29:29.333 --> 29:30.291
You won.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.875
Now, if you don't mind...

29:31.958 --> 29:33.958
[dramatic music playing]

29:41.416 --> 29:42.250
Hey.

29:43.833 --> 29:47.541
I think you have bigger problems
than who your wife fucked or didn't fuck.

30:06.750 --> 30:07.666
Maya?

30:08.541 --> 30:09.666
[glass shatters]

30:09.750 --> 30:11.750
[ominous music playing]

30:32.958 --> 30:33.958
Whoa, what's that?

30:35.583 --> 30:36.958
[sighs] Are you crazy?

30:37.041 --> 30:39.416
[stammers] What's going on, Maya?

30:43.750 --> 30:45.458
She wrote that she's "sorry"?

30:45.541 --> 30:47.958
That she didn't mean to "hurt you"?

30:51.958 --> 30:53.750
You know what? After last time,

30:53.833 --> 30:56.750
I decided to ignore
all the voices I have in my head.

30:56.833 --> 31:00.041
That I shouldn't believe you,
that I should check your phone.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.500
And not ignore.

31:01.583 --> 31:04.375
Not to check your phone.
Not to check your clothes.

31:04.458 --> 31:08.000
-Hey, hey. What are you doing?
-What I should have done in a while.

31:09.666 --> 31:12.666
-I'm gonna take you to court!
-Stop that. Stop that.

31:15.416 --> 31:19.708
I'll prove you're nothing
but a cheating, low-life fuck!

31:20.750 --> 31:23.291
Maya, I'm not gonna lie, okay?
I don't want to lie to you.

31:23.958 --> 31:24.791
Really.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.666
Yeah. We had a thing, yeah.

31:32.583 --> 31:35.625
A long time ago,
when things weren't that great with us.

31:36.541 --> 31:39.500
But it's done. I swear that it's done.
It's been done for years.

31:39.583 --> 31:42.500
Really? Then why
did she send this just now?

31:44.375 --> 31:46.916
I don't know. Maybe--
Maybe she still loved me.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.833
Maybe-- Maybe she wanted more or, uh...

31:49.916 --> 31:51.125
I have no idea.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.958
I didn't want you to get hurt,
so I didn't talk.

31:54.666 --> 31:57.708
But it's over now, Maya,
I swear. It's done.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.291
Lying shit.

32:05.250 --> 32:08.583
She's dead, okay, Maya?
She's dead. She's dead!

32:09.166 --> 32:12.958
It's the dancer, the American.
The one who died in the hit-and-run.

32:13.833 --> 32:15.166
It's definitely over.

32:16.541 --> 32:17.500
[Maya sighs]

32:39.208 --> 32:41.583
[Tali] That's the camera
from Ben Gurion. There.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.666
-[Segev] That's the guy?
-[Tali] Yeah.

32:44.166 --> 32:46.166
Tomas Polgar. Does it ring a bell?

32:49.291 --> 32:50.791
Here's the other guy.

32:53.875 --> 32:56.625
-Boton Gunsberg?
-No.

32:57.250 --> 33:00.208
What we've got is
that they both have Hungarian passports.

33:01.458 --> 33:03.750
-Where did they go?
-London.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.250
Heathrow.

33:05.875 --> 33:07.250
But they're Hungarian?

33:07.333 --> 33:09.583
They got on the first flight
that left the country.

33:09.666 --> 33:13.958
I don't get it. So they came to Tel Aviv,
stole a car and hit her? That's weird.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.166
I don't know. I don't know, Segev.

33:17.250 --> 33:21.916
It's possible that they came here
for some sun, and things got fucked.

33:25.208 --> 33:26.041
All right.

33:26.708 --> 33:28.000
-Bye.
-Segev?

33:29.916 --> 33:32.000
We'll find out what happened, okay?

33:32.541 --> 33:35.750
As soon as we find them.
I'm gonna find them.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.916
A bit to the left, Moshe.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.458
-Your left.
-[Moshe] Oh.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.625
Now flap your hands a bit.

33:58.708 --> 34:01.041
-You serious?
-Come on.

34:04.416 --> 34:07.500
I look like a duck. Or a chicken.

34:07.583 --> 34:09.416
Driveway's still dark.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.583
Tell me, Segev,

34:13.666 --> 34:17.041
if you say they caught them,
the guys who hit Danielle, in London,

34:17.125 --> 34:21.625
then why are we building a fortress here?
All these fancy lights...

34:21.708 --> 34:23.125
What do you mean? For safety.

34:25.916 --> 34:29.375
-Let's try one more time, Moshe.
-No, but then the entrance will be dark.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.958
-No, it'll work.
-Why fuck with it? Why fuck with it?

34:32.041 --> 34:34.750
-We need to get the driveway.
-We're just gonna have to start over

34:34.833 --> 34:37.291
-'cause you keep messing with it.
-Moshe, stop!

34:37.375 --> 34:38.458
Stop it!

34:40.166 --> 34:41.166
Tell me.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.541
Why did you even stop at that coffee shop?

34:46.125 --> 34:48.125
[dramatic music playing]

34:51.166 --> 34:52.708
[stammers] I don't know.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.833
-[stammers] We had time.
-She had to catch her flight, no?

34:56.458 --> 34:57.583
Come on, Segev.

34:58.416 --> 35:01.333
-It's not his fault. It was an accident.
-You don't know that.

35:01.416 --> 35:03.666
And I don't know that
and Moshe, for sure, doesn't!

35:04.333 --> 35:05.791
And I'm here and she's not!

35:06.416 --> 35:08.875
And all because
of your fucking coffee, no?

35:12.916 --> 35:13.791
I'm sorry.

35:22.625 --> 35:23.541
[Tali] Okay.

35:24.291 --> 35:27.083
Yes, just please have them
reach out to me directly.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.250
Thank you.

35:36.375 --> 35:37.875
-What is it?
-Stuffed pepper.

35:38.916 --> 35:41.875
Tami thought you could use
some extra protein for the baby.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.291
Tell her I said thanks.

35:47.458 --> 35:48.500
How are things?

35:49.125 --> 35:50.375
Nothing new.

35:52.083 --> 35:55.166
We know they flew to London,
and now they're gone.

35:55.250 --> 35:58.708
I tried to get ahold of the guy
from Interpol, but he's not there yet.

35:59.416 --> 36:02.000
Tali, I'm removing you
from the investigation.

36:02.083 --> 36:05.583
-What do you mean?
-I'm aware it's a family thing, but...

36:05.666 --> 36:06.833
it can't be healthy.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.541
You know, a conflict of interest.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.791
Dror, I can be professional.

36:11.875 --> 36:15.208
If this case ever sees a trial,
any connection you may have to it

36:15.291 --> 36:17.833
will compromise it.
You wanna fuck up the file?

36:19.125 --> 36:21.333
I'm sure you don't. Just let it be.

36:21.416 --> 36:23.666
Their faces are plastered
all over the world.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.666
Interpol can take it from here, okay?

36:28.083 --> 36:31.625
Hey, heat it
in the microwave first. It's good.

36:47.208 --> 36:51.375
[woman on TV] Interpol is looking
for Tomas Polgar and Boton Gunsberg,

36:51.458 --> 36:54.666
after security cameras
at Ben Gurion Airport

36:54.750 --> 36:57.916
captured images of the suspects
in the hit-and-run incident

36:58.000 --> 37:01.250
where Danielle Azulai,
a dancer at Batsheva,

37:01.333 --> 37:03.666
was killed in front of Cafe Loveat.

37:03.750 --> 37:07.416
The Hungarian nationals arrived
at Ben Gurion Airport

37:07.500 --> 37:09.458
shortly after the incident

37:09.541 --> 37:14.958
and were seen taking the first flight out
of Israel to London's Heathrow Airport.

have information regarding the two

I saw them.

A couple nights
before Danielle was killed.

39:52.083 --> 39:55.125
I hadn't even thought about it
until I saw their faces on the news.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.416
-Yeah, come on, one more drink.
-No. No.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.708
No, please let me toast you.
It's good luck before the audition.

-All right, bye.

40:38.916 --> 40:42.375
We would come here sometimes
after rehearsals.

40:42.458 --> 40:45.875
The owner's nice,
but the regulars can get a little rowdy.

40:46.583 --> 40:48.541
Do you recognize anyone from that night?

40:49.916 --> 40:51.166
Not really.

40:52.791 --> 40:55.208
Just Avi. Hey, Avi!

40:55.291 --> 40:56.791
[Avi] Hey, what's up?

40:58.166 --> 41:01.125
-One drink.
-Avi, ever seen these guys?

41:02.583 --> 41:03.916
-No.
-[Syd] Um...

41:04.000 --> 41:06.958
Uh, they were here last week
when I was toasting Dani.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.500
-And you gave us a couple extra shots.
-Maybe.

41:11.583 --> 41:16.208
I think maybe one of those guys got
into a shoving match with Uri.

41:16.291 --> 41:17.333
Who's Uri?

41:18.875 --> 41:20.583
He's the local provider.

41:21.166 --> 41:24.125
-[Syd] Drug dealer.
-[Avi] The bouncer had to kick him out.

41:24.791 --> 41:25.750
Stay here.

41:27.166 --> 41:29.875
-Hey. Hey. Hey, hello!
-What are you doing?

41:29.958 --> 41:32.500
-[woman] Hey, hey!
-Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

43:03.250 --> 43:04.458
What do you want?

43:11.625 --> 43:14.083
Crap, man. What do you want?

43:14.750 --> 43:19.833
Hey, two weeks ago, you were in a fight
at some bar, right? Who were they?

43:19.916 --> 43:21.208
You're a cop?

43:21.916 --> 43:23.250
[shouting]

43:24.833 --> 43:26.583
I don't remember any of it!

43:26.666 --> 43:28.791
-Who were they?
-I don't remember! Come on.

43:30.625 --> 43:35.000
I swear, it was
my first time going there. I swear.

43:40.041 --> 43:41.083
What the fuck?

43:43.375 --> 43:46.208
You're going to kill me. You're crazy.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.708
Don't kill me!

43:47.791 --> 43:49.458
Okay! Okay, okay.

43:49.541 --> 43:51.000
I get it, okay? Just--

43:51.083 --> 43:53.125
I just gave them some coke, okay?

43:53.208 --> 43:55.708
They tried to short me,
we fought a little, and that's all!

43:55.791 --> 43:58.333
-I'm gonna ask you, who were they?
-I don't know!

43:58.416 --> 43:59.625
I don't ask.

43:59.708 --> 44:02.125
They were just some Americans, that's all!

44:02.208 --> 44:04.208
[ominous music playing]

44:05.083 --> 44:06.375
What do you mean, they were American?

44:06.458 --> 44:10.166
I don't know. I'm telling you,
they were just Americans, okay?

44:10.250 --> 44:11.958
Americans, trust me!

44:15.958 --> 44:17.166
Americans?

44:17.250 --> 44:20.291
Tali, they knew what they we're doing.
They're professionals.

44:20.875 --> 44:23.916
They followed her. When she stopped
for a coffee, they knew what to do.

44:24.708 --> 44:28.416
But why would anyone want
to kill Danielle? It doesn't make sense.

44:30.583 --> 44:32.208
Maybe it wasn't about her.

44:38.250 --> 44:39.666
What are you saying, Segev?

44:40.833 --> 44:42.041
You know what I was.

44:42.750 --> 44:43.875
What I used to do.

44:55.208 --> 44:58.625
So, what do you say? Think you can help?

44:59.416 --> 45:01.083
For you I'll do it.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.791
I do have a raw connection
at Homeland Security.

45:03.875 --> 45:07.375
We can cross-check their image
with any passport, but it will, uh...

45:07.458 --> 45:09.916
-take a while.
-I have to get to the station.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.375

45:32.916 --> 45:33.916
It's great!

45:34.666 --> 45:36.791
-Right?
-So where are you going?

45:37.375 --> 45:38.500
The station.

45:38.583 --> 45:40.333
I'll walk with you. It's on my way.

45:43.666 --> 45:45.041
-All good?
-Mm-hm.

You're gonna be a mother.

46:06.333 --> 46:08.083
No. No, it's not yours.

46:23.250 --> 46:24.083
Yeah.

46:24.708 --> 46:25.916
I guess I was ready,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.083
and I was tired of waiting
for someone to say he's ready too.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.333
But, anyway...

46:45.833 --> 46:47.625
I'm also happy I'm happy.

46:50.791 --> 46:52.625
So, what were you doing here?

46:53.750 --> 46:55.375
I'm not in the police anymore.

46:55.458 --> 46:56.541
Really?

46:56.625 --> 47:00.291
I work for a private cyber company,
and we have a client around here.

47:01.208 --> 47:03.375
Nice. I bet it pays way better.

and David Chernik.

They made it to London, switched passports
and flew to New York.

Okay. What about criminal history?

48:29.583 --> 48:33.208
Mainly little stuff.
Maybe a few break-ins and stolen cars.

-Bye.

in my house and tried to kill me.
