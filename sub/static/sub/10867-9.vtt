00:30.615 --> 00:32.575
That is SO not fair!

00:32.575 --> 00:34.243
What's not fair?

00:34.243 --> 00:36.203
You know that club that
I belong to at school?

00:36.203 --> 00:37.872
The Ring Club?

00:37.872 --> 00:40.959
You mean that snobby club
with the jocks and what-not?

00:40.959 --> 00:42.627
It's a service club.

00:42.627 --> 00:45.296
Andy tried to get in
and they turned him down.

00:45.296 --> 00:48.215
Didn't you say something?
Sure!

00:48.215 --> 00:51.427
I told them what a great
guy he is and...

00:51.427 --> 00:54.931
They turned him down anyway...
snobs!

00:54.931 --> 00:57.767
Look. He probably knows by
now, so when he gets here,

00:57.767 --> 00:58.977
don't say anything.

00:58.977 --> 01:00.478
No problem.
-Okay.

01:00.478 --> 01:02.814
Hey guys!

01:02.814 --> 01:04.857
Andy I'm sorry.
-You OK man?

01:04.857 --> 01:07.067
It's okay, I'm not upset.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.360
But it's not fair!

01:08.360 --> 01:09.779
Well, things
aren't always fair...

01:09.779 --> 01:12.865
and I got a good
story out of it.

01:12.865 --> 01:16.452
If it's about those
guys, it's a horror story.

01:16.452 --> 01:18.370
Hey, they're not that bad!

01:18.370 --> 01:21.457
It's a story about
trying to join a club,

01:21.457 --> 01:23.709
and about the different
things you could do

01:23.709 --> 01:26.086
if you don't get in.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.840
You could let it go and move on.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.342
You could get mad.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.052
Or you could...

01:33.052 --> 01:35.429
get even.

01:37.473 --> 01:40.267
Submitted for the approval
of The Midnight Society,

01:40.267 --> 01:43.562
I call this story...

02:07.045 --> 02:13.300
Those who dare enter this place,
must pay the ultimate price.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.559
You four are the last.

02:21.559 --> 02:27.815
You must pass the test, or
suffer the consequences.

02:27.815 --> 02:33.487
These bowls hold the cold
intestines of a wild boar.

02:33.487 --> 02:40.619
You must reach inside,
and grab a handful...

02:43.081 --> 02:45.249
now eat!

02:45.249 --> 02:46.249
EAT!

02:56.928 --> 03:00.514
NO WAY I'M OUTTA HERE!

03:04.560 --> 03:07.354
Well I guess he
didn't have the guts.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.860
Cherry Gelatin.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.653
Delicious!

03:14.653 --> 03:18.157
Nicely done gentleman, you've
passed the test of bravery.

03:18.157 --> 03:22.036
Only one test remains before
you can join The Lion Society.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.207
Man, I almost puked.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.793
You really thought
those were guts?

03:28.793 --> 03:32.254
Nah. I hate cherry
gelatin. Yeech.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.716
Oh man, I can't believe we're
gettin' in The Lion Society!

03:35.716 --> 03:37.342
We're gonna rule this school.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.844
You psyched?

03:38.844 --> 03:41.013
I'll be psyched once we're in.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.347
What could happen?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.767
You and I we're a
team, we're in,

03:44.767 --> 03:46.560
this school's never
gonna be the same!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.479
Alright??

03:53.818 --> 03:57.655
You three are all that
remain of this years candidates.

03:57.655 --> 04:01.075
The Lion Society has a long
tradition of accepting only the

04:01.075 --> 04:03.577
most worthy of members
from the students here at

04:03.577 --> 04:05.163
Tillinghast Academy.

04:05.163 --> 04:07.539
We'd be proud to
have each of you.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.625
Congratulations.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.544
But one test remains...

04:12.544 --> 04:15.464
the most difficult of all.

04:15.464 --> 04:18.884
The tradition is that before a
candidate can join the club,

04:18.884 --> 04:20.678
they must pull off a...

04:20.678 --> 04:22.304
bold prank.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.681
A joke.

04:23.681 --> 04:27.643
Something daring,
original and creative...

04:27.643 --> 04:30.104
all the traits of a Lion.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.940
Oh, and...
you can't get caught.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.693
Good luck!

04:40.239 --> 04:42.908
Chandler, can I
speak to you for minute?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.368
Sure.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.287
Congratulations, you're in.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.124
Really? That's great but, you
gotta see my prank first.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.043
I'm not worried about that.

04:52.043 --> 04:54.128
But there is a slight problem.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.754
Your roommate.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.381
Oh, Alex?

04:57.381 --> 04:59.675
He's a great guy.
Is he?

04:59.675 --> 05:03.387
We don't exactly feel that
he's Lion Society material.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.931
Frankly we didn't
think he'd get this far.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.392
He's on the honor
roll, he's an athlete,

05:08.392 --> 05:09.852
he's the best at...

05:09.852 --> 05:12.146
This isn't a discussion.
I'm telling you.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.439
You're in and, he's out.

05:14.439 --> 05:18.360
And if you have any problem with
that, you can BOTH be out.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.612
Don't be an idiot.

05:20.612 --> 05:24.242
Oh, and would you mind
telling him yourself?

05:24.242 --> 05:28.537
I think it would be
easier coming from you.

05:34.793 --> 05:38.047
Maybe I'll send out a bogus
e-mail declaring some sort

05:38.047 --> 05:39.673
of school holiday.

05:39.673 --> 05:44.136
Or, I know, I'll put something
in the school paper.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.804
Yeah!

05:45.804 --> 05:48.724
Big headline: Lizards from
biology lab lost in sewers...

05:48.724 --> 05:50.475
be careful where you sit!"

05:50.475 --> 05:52.352
Hey what are you going to do?

05:52.352 --> 05:57.066
Ummm, I was thinking of swipping
the painting from the Hall of

05:57.066 --> 05:59.860
Headmasters and hang it
up on the detention board.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.445
Hey that's cool.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.614
Man, this is gonna be great!
We're gonna have a...

06:03.614 --> 06:06.617
They don't want you, Alex.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.493
What?

06:08.493 --> 06:09.745
Renfrew told me.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.371
He said you're out.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.165
But... why? I didn't even...

06:13.165 --> 06:14.833
I don't know.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.794
Yeah you do.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.796
It's cuz I'm a scholarship kid.

06:18.796 --> 06:22.174
I'm not from some
rich society family.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.009
I'm sorry man.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.304
So what are you gonna do?

06:28.306 --> 06:31.309
My grandfather was a Lion, Al.

06:31.309 --> 06:33.518
And my father was too.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.021
I can't quit.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.691
Oh well, so much for the team.

07:34.663 --> 07:38.500
[alarm siren]

07:44.506 --> 07:47.134
HEY!
STOP!

07:52.472 --> 07:54.225
I'm dead meat!

07:54.225 --> 07:56.394
I thought you were going to
hang it on the detention board?

07:56.394 --> 07:58.687
A guard showed up.
I had to bolt.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.731
Search every room.

08:00.731 --> 08:04.109
Find that painting!

08:06.404 --> 08:08.780
Campus Security!
Open up!

08:08.780 --> 08:10.657
Quick he's coming!

08:10.657 --> 08:12.201
Oh I am fried!!!

08:12.201 --> 08:14.703
Try here.

08:18.082 --> 08:20.876
Campus Security!
Open up!

08:20.876 --> 08:22.878
What am I gonna do?

08:22.878 --> 08:27.383
Hold on. We'll just hide
the painting and then...

08:27.383 --> 08:28.633
whoa.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.765
Campus security!
-Just a minute!

08:34.765 --> 08:37.351
Roll it up!

08:43.732 --> 08:46.777
Campus security!

08:52.824 --> 08:55.327
What's the hubba?

08:55.327 --> 08:57.788
Room search.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.137
Something wrong?

09:13.137 --> 09:13.887
No.

09:22.854 --> 09:26.650
Sorry to bother you.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.200
Oh man, I coulda got
expelled for that.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.494
Thanks man.

09:36.494 --> 09:37.828
No problem.

09:37.828 --> 09:40.664
Anything to get you
in The Lion Society.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.475
Chandler?

10:08.567 --> 10:11.195
What was that?

10:11.195 --> 10:13.780
What was what?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.450
I heard a...

10:26.460 --> 10:30.255
Hey wasn't there a
guy in this picture?

10:30.255 --> 10:31.840
Why?

10:31.840 --> 10:35.594
Well he's not there anymore.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.597
Maybe because he wasn't
there in the first place.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.182
Go to sleep.

10:40.182 --> 10:43.185
What about that creaking noise?

10:43.185 --> 10:44.603
I don't know.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.356
The closet?

10:50.401 --> 10:52.110
Mmm...

10:52.110 --> 10:55.364
I'm gonna check the hall.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.192
Alex?

11:35.654 --> 11:37.322
Ahhh!!
-Quiet!

11:37.322 --> 11:39.824
You'll wake the dead!

11:44.538 --> 11:47.707
Alex I think you
oughtta come and see this.

11:50.252 --> 11:53.838
The guy in the picture!
He's back!

11:53.838 --> 11:56.467
Chandler!

12:07.645 --> 12:09.980
Help! Somebody
help me! Heeeelp!

12:09.980 --> 12:11.773
What is your problem???

12:11.773 --> 12:13.651
Chandler!
He was sucked into the picture!

12:13.651 --> 12:15.277
What???
-I swear!

12:15.277 --> 12:19.197
And there's a kid in the
picture! He's got a...

12:19.197 --> 12:21.158
He's gone again!

12:21.158 --> 12:22.867
But he was on the porch.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.328
He had - he had a camera.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.079
And there were sounds,
like creaking, and...

12:26.079 --> 12:28.790
You know the The Lion
Society doesn't want you?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.208
Yeah but...

12:30.208 --> 12:32.544
Then don't bother
pulling off a prank.

12:32.544 --> 12:33.837
Good night.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.088
But it's not a prank!

12:35.088 --> 12:38.133
I said...
good night.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.938
The portrait of Headmaster
Broffman was done in

12:51.938 --> 12:54.232
the mid 1940s.

12:54.232 --> 12:58.654
It hung right there until
last night when it was stolen.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.990
Would you know if
there was something...

13:01.990 --> 13:03.200
under it?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.703
Under it...
like what?

13:05.703 --> 13:07.503
Well...
Nothing.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.252
If you want more information,
check the old yearbooks

13:14.252 --> 13:16.463
in the stacks.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.303
Thanks.

13:37.942 --> 13:41.029
Lion Society...
1944.

13:41.029 --> 13:44.700
I bet they were a bunch
of jerks back then too.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.540
Band...

13:47.118 --> 13:48.579
Hockey team...

13:48.579 --> 13:51.915
camera club...

13:51.915 --> 13:54.292
Jasper Davis.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.671
Died in 1944.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.408
Do you have it?!
-Ahhh!

14:26.408 --> 14:27.785
Professor Barish.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.286
Do you have the photo?

14:29.286 --> 14:30.954
What photo?

14:30.954 --> 14:32.497
The one behind the painting.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.207
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.501
Now don't be coy, Alex.
If you have it, tell me.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.795
I don't have it!

14:37.795 --> 14:40.338
Where's Chandler, Alex?

14:42.340 --> 14:43.634
You won't believe me.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.594
He's in the photo, isn't he?

14:45.594 --> 14:46.886
How d'you know?

14:46.886 --> 14:50.098
Because my friend
is in there too.

14:50.098 --> 14:53.435
Jasper Davis and I came to
Tillinghast the same year.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.771
He was my best friend.

14:55.771 --> 14:59.065
I joined The Lion Society and I
got Jasper the job of taking

14:59.065 --> 15:01.109
the official photograph.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.360
That's us.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.822
Stuffy looking crew.

15:04.822 --> 15:07.240
Not much has changed.
No, I suppose not.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.576
Well, the members decided to
play a prank and they told

15:09.576 --> 15:11.870
Jasper they wanted
him to join the club.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.623
But he wasn't Lion
Society material, right?

15:14.623 --> 15:15.874
No.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.917
Of course Jasper was thrilled.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.961
He thought he was
gonna finally fit in.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.296
But he wasn't.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.047
No, he wasn't.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.634
When they told him they'd no
intention of accepting him,

15:25.634 --> 15:28.386
he got upset and he ran off.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.888
But the boys wouldn't stop.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.766
They chased after him,
making fun of his clothes,

15:32.766 --> 15:34.476
and the way he spoke...

15:34.476 --> 15:37.270
it was inexcusable...

15:37.270 --> 15:40.982
what an arrogant group of fools.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.485
What happened?

15:43.485 --> 15:45.904
Jasper ended up
running onto the roof.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.947
There was a terrible accident...

15:47.947 --> 15:49.282
he fell.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.827
And died.

15:51.827 --> 15:52.827
Yes.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.373
The clubhouse was
moved across campus

15:56.373 --> 15:58.082
to this building right here.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.211
Then about a month later,
the photo mysteriously

16:01.211 --> 16:02.754
appeared on the wall.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.299
That very same night I saw
two boys pulled into it.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.386
Yeah like Chandler!

16:09.386 --> 16:10.846
No one believes me.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.723
They won't believe me either.

16:12.723 --> 16:16.434
I didn't know what to do, so I
hid it behind the portrait of

16:16.434 --> 16:19.354
Broffman, hoping one day I'd
have the courage to find out

16:19.354 --> 16:21.899
what happened.
So what are we going to do?

16:21.899 --> 16:26.277
I don't know, but we can't
let that photo get anyone else.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.700
What do YOU want?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.993
I'm looking for Chandler.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.080
Yeah, well he's not here.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.879
Did I invite you in?

16:43.879 --> 16:46.172
Listen Alex, about
The Lion Society...

16:46.172 --> 16:47.674
I don't want to hear it.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.843
You wouldn't have been
happy with us. Trust me.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.053
Whatever.
See ya.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.931
Where did you get
this old thing?

16:53.931 --> 16:55.724
Get away from that!

16:55.724 --> 16:58.184
Wait, I know this!

16:58.184 --> 17:00.270
It's the Old Lion
Society clubhouse.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.730
It is?

17:01.730 --> 17:04.273
Yes. The one that's on
the old part of campus.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.401
Look.
There's even a kid on the porch.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.944
Don't look at him!

17:07.944 --> 17:10.238
Why not?

17:13.241 --> 17:15.242
Oh man.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.663
Oh man oh man oh man!

17:19.915 --> 17:22.792
Old part of campus?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.701
Welcome to MY club.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.745
Jasper Davis?
But you're...

18:40.745 --> 18:44.207
Dead? Yeah. I know. Ouch.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.459
And it was all their fault.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.752
They rejected me, you know.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.588
And then they
killed me right outside.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.424
Well you're not so
high and mighty now,

18:53.424 --> 18:55.218
are you lions?

18:55.218 --> 18:56.469
Where are they?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.221
Right there! In the pictures,

18:58.221 --> 18:59.848
and that's where they're
gonna stay, forever.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.600
But, you fell off the building.
It was an accident.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.061
Was it?

19:04.061 --> 19:05.979
If only they had let me
in their stupid club,

19:05.979 --> 19:07.313
I never would have fallen.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.482
But no, I wasn't good enough.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.817
I didn't dress like them.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.819
I didn't have lots of money.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.739
Well I got the last laugh,
didn't I because I took

19:15.739 --> 19:17.240
some of 'em with me...

19:17.240 --> 19:18.616
And now it's your turn.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.411
Jasper, leave him alone.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.830
Felix?
Is that you?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.331
Yes.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.751
You got old.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.711
Felix was my friend.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.672
But it was more
important for him to be a Lion.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.758
He chased me onto the
roof with the others.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.176
No!
I came to help you.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.346
Then he covered up my
picture for all those years.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.432
I was all alone.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.767
I had to stop you!

19:43.767 --> 19:45.936
You were going to
take more of the Lions!

19:45.936 --> 19:48.063
You're right! I was!

19:48.063 --> 19:50.607
And now I've got a prime
spot saved just for you,

19:50.607 --> 19:53.110
old buddy.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.569
No Jasper.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.446
Welcome to MY club, Felix!

19:56.446 --> 19:58.990
Stop it!

19:58.990 --> 20:01.200
Looks like THAT won't work!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.493
Smile for the birdie.

20:02.493 --> 20:06.081
Jasper!
Noooo!!!

20:07.582 --> 20:10.085
Your turn.

20:12.129 --> 20:15.048
Aw c'mon, it doesn't hurt!

20:42.867 --> 20:44.368
Jasper don't do this.

20:44.368 --> 20:50.249
Sorry, you're gonna be
part of MY club now.

20:50.249 --> 20:54.171
Okay, okay, but if I'm gonna
be stuck on that wall forever,

20:54.171 --> 20:56.089
I want to at least look good.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.507
All my photographs look good.

20:57.507 --> 20:58.925
I'm an excellent photographer.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.885
Right, yeah, sure.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.013
I want a good close up.

21:03.013 --> 21:05.640
Get in real nice and close.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.478
Say cheese!

21:12.772 --> 21:16.484
Noooo!
Hey Alex?

21:49.184 --> 21:51.561
Nice shot, man.
Chandler!

21:51.561 --> 21:53.354
Are you guys alright?

21:53.354 --> 21:56.107
We are now, thanks to you.
Hey.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.401
What about those other
guys from back in '44?

21:58.401 --> 22:00.361
Let's hope they've
gone to a better place...

22:00.361 --> 22:02.321
along with Jasper.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.990
Poor fellow.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.743
I wish I could be angry with
him, but I just feel sad.

22:06.743 --> 22:09.370
Good show, Alex.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.372
I believe we made a mistake.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.374
Welcome to The Lion Society!

22:13.374 --> 22:15.126
You're in!

22:15.126 --> 22:19.463
Tell you what, you Lion Society
geeks have fun telling each

22:19.463 --> 22:21.716
other you're better
than everybody else.

22:21.716 --> 22:24.343
And I'll hang with people
who have better things to do.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.930
You can't be serious!

22:26.930 --> 22:30.308
Chandler, convince the boy.
Of what?

22:30.308 --> 22:33.144
That he should hang around
with a gang of loser snobs?

22:33.144 --> 22:34.437
I don't think so.

22:34.437 --> 22:35.772
I'm out too.

22:35.772 --> 22:39.483
I should have
said that years ago.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.403
I gotta return the
picture of Broffman.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.123
C'mon!

22:45.823 --> 22:48.451
Uh, wait for me!

22:48.451 --> 22:49.531
Please!?!

22:53.998 --> 22:56.293
The end.
Good story Andy.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.211
-That was great.
It was creepy.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.630
So? You gonna get even for
not getting into that club?

23:00.630 --> 23:02.799
Nah, that's no me.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.218
And as it turns out...

23:05.218 --> 23:07.262
They let me in!

23:07.262 --> 23:08.596
That's great!
-Really?

23:08.596 --> 23:10.014
It's all cuz of Tucker.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.891
He really fought for
me, and when they

23:11.891 --> 23:13.476
still said no, he quit.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.603
Really?
You quit for Andy?

23:15.603 --> 23:17.521
That is SO COOL.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.357
But they changed their minds?

23:19.357 --> 23:23.069
Well, since you quit, there was
an extra spot in the club so...

23:23.069 --> 23:27.031
So... you took MY place???

23:27.031 --> 23:30.576
I gotta get to those guys!

23:30.576 --> 23:32.703
Did you really take his spot???

23:32.703 --> 23:33.453
No!

23:34.164 --> 23:37.041
I just like seeing him
go all snaky like that.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.002
He's still in...

23:39.002 --> 23:41.045
and so am I.
