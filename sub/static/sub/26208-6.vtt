I have a

00:06.472 --> 00:08.141
I'm a time traveler

00:08.174 --> 00:11.144

(Lena) Previously...
-The future isn't so bad.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.584
This is
amazing!

00:50.617 --> 00:54.220
<i>I'm wearing trousers!</i>
<i>And Jeff taught me some new</i>
<i>moves for the Blok.</i>

00:55.421 --> 00:57.423
Thea doesn't seem to like
me very much though.

00:57.457 --> 00:58.925
I'm onto you...

00:58.959 --> 01:02.362
<i>I finally heard back from</i>
<i>Henri. He's back in</i>
<i>1905.</i>

01:02.395 --> 01:05.398
You put your girl in
a bubble. No one can get to
her now.

01:05.431 --> 01:07.367
I guess we'll have to come
up with a new plan.

01:09.135 --> 01:13.640
(car horns honking)
(classical piano music
plays)

01:14.274 --> 01:18.178
And remember ladies, form and
grace make the dancer.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.251
(Ines) OK, I just don't
think I can get any more
graceful than this.

01:25.285 --> 01:28.154
I'll tell you when you're
graceful enough, Miss Le
Breton.

01:29.823 --> 01:34.327
I think you're very
graceful, Miss Le Breton.
Like a swan queen.
-(Thea scoffs)

01:34.360 --> 01:38.098
(Ms Carré) Let's mark through
the music and focus on the
arms.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.801
(snaps her
fingers)

01:43.236 --> 01:45.238
Wanna have some fun,
girls?

01:45.271 --> 01:46.306
(minions)
Uh-huh.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.341
(Violette) Lena's got
perfect old-school
form

01:48.374 --> 01:50.844
and brings something to the
table that we've never seen
before.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.548
But Thea's well... Thea.
-Uh-huh.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.218
(Violette) Wicked dancer,
and a gazillion
followers.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.620
(minions)
Yeah.

01:59.653 --> 02:03.657
I know she seems like a
no-brainer, but I'm playing
the long game.

02:03.690 --> 02:04.525
(minions)
Hm-hm.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.393
Ms Carré favors Lena's
style, I bet.

02:08.729 --> 02:12.766
This is a tough call. Care
to make it interesting?

02:12.799 --> 02:13.834
(minions)
Yeah.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.303
(classical piano music
plays)

02:23.243 --> 02:26.913
We're being watched.
They're looking for Little
Mothers.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.516
Little whats?
-Mothers. Like
mentors.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.386
(Lena) She's so
cute!

02:36.890 --> 02:39.192
How do I get one?
-They ask you.

02:39.225 --> 02:42.295
You don't even have a
profile on the socials. So,
good luck.

02:43.429 --> 02:47.768
I don't need luck. I'm
going to get one of those
mentees for myself.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.941
(Ms Carré) There's a
company rehearsal tomorrow.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.579
Whoever impresses
me the most will attend.

02:58.612 --> 03:03.817
If you win, you may bring
your mentee with you. Class
dismissed.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.855
Lena? You weren't here last
year, so it's
understandable

03:08.889 --> 03:11.525
that you don't grasp the
choreography fully yet.

03:11.558 --> 03:12.626
I'll improve.

03:12.659 --> 03:16.563
Yes, you will.
By tomorrow. Thea will
tutor you.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.666
Of course. I'm happy
to.

03:22.468 --> 03:27.407
(Thea) Hmm. So, we both
need to impress Ms Carré. Hard
when you don't know the
choreo.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.242
I guess you better
teach me then.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.545
Because if you don't, Ms Carré
will blame you.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.314
Whatever.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.716
(Ines scoffs)
-(Lena sighs)

03:38.952 --> 03:41.021
(girl) Looking for
a mentee?
-Hey.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.256
And yeah. Come on!
-(Girl) Yeah!

03:45.826 --> 03:50.463
(Lena) She's so cute!
(Gasps) You can teach her how
to thread a needle

03:50.496 --> 03:52.298
and conduct
herself respectably.

03:52.332 --> 03:57.437
Yeah, that's a hot
lesson. Every girl wants to
learn to sew and be quiet.
(Both chuckle)

03:59.673 --> 04:01.307
What if I don't
get chosen?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.610
Gabrielle will
notice.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.750
Lena, cool it with the
zippers!

04:10.450 --> 04:14.420
But they're
amazing. And such a time
saver.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.889
This would be
twenty buttons back
home.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.758
(Ines
chuckles)

04:19.893 --> 04:23.396
(ticking and
magical tinkling
noises)

04:31.872 --> 04:34.575
So, boss. Figured out
what happened to us
yet?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.476
I... I don't know.

04:37.711 --> 04:42.448
When we were about to grab
Lena's timepiece she did
something to it.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.685
Maybe she used it to...

04:44.718 --> 04:46.853
Do something. To us!

04:47.554 --> 04:51.625
(Frank) Yes, Clive. She used
it to do something to us.
Obviously.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.897
Clearly, her timepiece
can do things we don't
understand.

04:57.397 --> 05:00.634
And now we've lost one
of ours.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.736
(Clive) I just left
it out in the open!

05:02.769 --> 05:05.706
It was her
boyfriend that stole it.
Blame him!

05:08.875 --> 05:11.477
I want to know
everything about that
timepiece.

05:12.445 --> 05:15.949
And Lena. And
her boyfriend.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.019
Hm... What was his
name again?

05:19.052 --> 05:21.655
Hey! What was your
name, again?

05:23.389 --> 05:25.125
-Clive?
-Yeah?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.994
When you see the guy
we're looking for you might
want to say, "He's over there."
-Ah.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.663
Come on!

05:33.667 --> 05:36.837
(whizzing
motorcycles, honking
car horns)

05:36.870 --> 05:38.539
(phone
beeps)

05:38.572 --> 05:40.941
(Jeff) What does it
say?

05:42.776 --> 05:47.581
"I hear you're quite the
impressive ballet boy. Show me
some moves?"

05:47.614 --> 05:49.583
That's from Paul G,
yo!

05:49.616 --> 05:51.084
Who's Paul G, yo?

05:51.117 --> 05:53.687
Only the biggest
dance promoter in
Europe.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.723
Yeah! And I'm coming
with you.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.092
Jeff, I didn't say I was
going.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.662
We're keeping the
Blok quiet, remember?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.997
I don't even know how this
guy got my number.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.699
Come on, man... You
can ask him when we see him.

06:05.732 --> 06:10.436
Well, you gentlemen go
ahead and admit you're part
of an underground dance
crew.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.905
I'm gonna sit this
one out. Bye!

06:12.973 --> 06:15.108
Pffff. Don't need
him!

06:15.141 --> 06:17.878
You know what? Let's do
it.

06:18.211 --> 06:23.183
I learned so much from
Clarisse. Not only did she
teach me how to do the
perfect bun,

06:23.216 --> 06:26.386
but she also taught me
how to properly treat my aching
feet with raw meat.

06:26.753 --> 06:27.988
Urgh...

06:28.021 --> 06:31.057
(embarrassed
giggle) Just kidding.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.560
That's totally
gross.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.164
Excuse me,
Lena?

06:38.198 --> 06:41.034
I'd love to! I
mean... I mean yes?

06:41.602 --> 06:43.904
Would you be my Little
Mother? I want to learn from
the best.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.040
Yes! Yes! Thank
you, Violette.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.676
I'm gonna be the best
Little Mother you could ever
ask for.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.811
(Violette) Oh, thank
you!

06:50.844 --> 06:53.814
I won't let you down.
-I have class. See you later!

06:53.847 --> 06:59.786
OK! Bye! (squeals
with excitement)

07:02.122 --> 07:03.857
Thea?

07:03.890 --> 07:06.560
Well, you said my
name. You might as well
finish.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.930
Would you be my Little
Mother? I want to learn from
the best.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.898
Do you have
minions?
-(snaps her fingers)

07:12.198 --> 07:13.600
Two.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.802
Then pay attention.
Let's go.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.607
(hip-hop music
plays)

07:20.641 --> 07:22.776
Oh yeah! Oh
yeah!

07:25.979 --> 07:30.684
(Jeff) Woohoo!
Dude. This is
tight.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.257
(Paul G) Paul G.
One of you was
invited.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.926
Let's get real! Last
summer in Berlin?

07:39.960 --> 07:44.698
That throw down at the
shipping container, that was
next level!

07:44.731 --> 07:47.568
Bro. I'm Jeff. It's
an honor.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.102
Max, then?
Yeah.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.706
(Jeff) Oh.
Yeah... I'll come back.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.709
Thanks for inviting
us. And for the
directions.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.211
We have to keep
things underground, man.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.614
So tell me about the
Blok. I'm curious.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.315
How do you know about
the Blok?

08:02.348 --> 08:05.051
I know a lot of
people, man. Why don't you
show me what you've got?

08:05.552 --> 08:07.521
Right now?
-Yes. Show me something.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.023
Maybe I got a
spot in my new
rotation.

08:11.257 --> 08:12.693
Let's do this.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.800
(horse
neighing)

08:21.034 --> 08:23.970
(Henri, breathing
fast)

08:24.004 --> 08:25.572
(Frank) Get
him!

08:31.277 --> 08:33.246
(out of
breath)

08:33.279 --> 08:35.248
Sit down.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.952
You're mad. I'm sorry.
But I...

08:38.985 --> 08:42.823
If you'd just done as
you were told, Lena wouldn't
be trapped and we wouldn't
have a problem.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.727
But we have a situation
right now and we need to
act... fast.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.029
You don't need to
do anything.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.933
I'm sending you to
Uncle Alain in Provence while
I fix this. Alone.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.637
(calls out) That is
a great idea! I'll pack!

08:56.670 --> 08:59.305
What's going on with
you? Henri, speak clearly.

09:01.775 --> 09:02.976
That is what I'm
talking about.

09:04.645 --> 09:08.214
(shrieking, then
grunting)

09:13.654 --> 09:17.190
Darts are coming out
of his eyes. They're like...
eye darts.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.693
It's over.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.831
You'll stay here until
I can get all of you to the
farm. Where you'll be locked up.

09:25.732 --> 09:31.672
(Henri) But! Wait,
wait! Wait. Dad! But...
(grunts)

09:35.008 --> 09:35.909
Hi, Henri.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.578
(Frank) You
thought you could
escape?

09:45.251 --> 09:48.221
I have a
surprise! I have
glitter!

09:49.189 --> 09:51.357
We're not
allowed to use
glitter.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.659
Totally don't need it.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.696
This bun will stand
out either way.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.664
It's actually a
more graceful look
without it.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.100
Is that
important?

10:00.734 --> 10:02.268
Grace is
everything.

10:04.805 --> 10:08.675
Is personal
style important?
-Totally.

10:09.810 --> 10:13.079
I'd like to stand
out. Like Thea.

10:14.815 --> 10:19.019
Well, there're
plenty of ways to stand
out.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.923
In fact, next time you
see me, I'll be standing out so
far,

10:22.956 --> 10:26.960
that you'll need
binoculars to see me!
See you later!

10:37.971 --> 10:40.874
(hip-hop music plays)
(people cheering)

10:40.907 --> 10:42.809
That's it, man!

10:44.745 --> 10:47.781
OK. You gotta
blow this place up,
bro.

10:47.814 --> 10:52.452
You win this, and the
Blok has instant street cred
and we can challenge any crew!

10:52.485 --> 10:54.788
Jeff. I know all of that.

10:54.821 --> 10:58.825
Okay, maybe this is a
little bit about my dream. But
still... crush it!

11:01.361 --> 11:03.129
Awesome!

11:06.432 --> 11:08.969
(people continue
cheering)

11:17.010 --> 11:18.378
Your
turn.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.715
Last year's moves,
man!

11:35.896 --> 11:38.264
(people
booing)

11:40.300 --> 11:42.368
(people
cheering)

11:43.436 --> 11:44.705
(Max
grunts)

11:47.340 --> 11:51.912
Is that all you got?
(people laughing and
booing)

11:51.945 --> 11:53.046
Come on!

11:53.313 --> 11:55.782
Thanks for dropping in.
(Tuts)

12:07.961 --> 12:10.897
You have to
project yourself at all
times.

12:10.931 --> 12:15.001
Don't even look at them.
Cause you're the only one
here.

12:16.102 --> 12:19.072
Lena says that
grace is important.

12:19.540 --> 12:22.308
Grace is for
people who don't have
presence.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.378
Anyway. Why are
you speaking to Little
Miss Perfect?

12:28.448 --> 12:31.251
Did she twist your
hair into that... bulb?

12:32.919 --> 12:38.759
(sighs) Well, if
invisibility is your desired
super power, go ahead. Be
just like her.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.764
(Lena) Oh, hey. What's
up?

12:45.532 --> 12:49.469
What's up is a
fashion citation. What are
you wearing?

12:49.503 --> 12:51.337
I like it. It's
cool.

12:51.605 --> 12:55.275
OK. First? No.
And, second? Why?

12:55.308 --> 12:58.979
Just offering some
personal style tips to my
mentee.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.481
Mentee? Why am I
hearing this?

13:03.349 --> 13:07.120
I couldn't decide which
one of you I wanted. So I asked
you both...

13:08.354 --> 13:12.292
Wait. So this is
a competition?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.375
Good morning,
Violette.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.580
Have you already
finished rehearsing with
Thea?

13:33.614 --> 13:37.518
Oh, we're not
rehearsing until later. I
can't handle Thea before
breakfast.

13:37.551 --> 13:42.589
But she said you
were rehearsing before
class. In Studio C.

13:42.623 --> 13:45.291
She changed the time
of our rehearsal? But why
would she do that?

13:46.560 --> 13:49.129
Lucky I ran into
you. Thanks!

13:58.905 --> 14:03.977
Points for getting me
breakfast, but I don't do
dairy. So no points.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.446
Why aren't you rehearsing with
Lena in Studio B?

14:07.213 --> 14:11.384
Studio B? No, in
Rehearsal Hall One, in like an
hour.

14:11.417 --> 14:14.555
Lena said Ms Carré
changed it. I thought you knew.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.123
She's messing
with the wrong
girl.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.364
Hey man. I thought
I'd get you some
breakfast.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.568
Why?

14:27.601 --> 14:30.470
Oh. You know... Just
cause you're so used to...
getting served!

14:30.504 --> 14:32.606
Oooohh! (Laughs)
Oooohh!

14:33.339 --> 14:36.376
What's up! (making
ridiculing noises)

14:37.077 --> 14:43.449
Come on man. A more
experienced dancer crushed
you. So what? That's what
happens sometimes.

14:43.483 --> 14:48.288
Dash! What if that was
the Blok's only chance to
break into the
underground scene?

14:48.321 --> 14:50.223
And I've blown it for all of
us?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.362
Max...

14:58.999 --> 15:00.333
(sighs)

15:01.702 --> 15:03.537
(chuckles)
You!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.106
Thea! What do you
think you're doing?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.474
You change the time of
our rehearsal and you're
not even there?

15:08.509 --> 15:09.576
Where were
you?

15:09.610 --> 15:11.712
Where were you?
You changed the time and
the place!

15:11.745 --> 15:13.479
(Lena) You just want me
to fail!

15:13.514 --> 15:16.149
No, I don't! What would
I care...
-(Ms Carré) Girls?

15:18.418 --> 15:22.288
Thea. Lena. Let's see
what you've accomplished
with the choreography.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.626
Lena's not ready yet,
Ms Carré.

15:25.659 --> 15:26.960
Is that true,
Lena?

15:28.161 --> 15:29.663
It is, Ms
Carré.

15:29.696 --> 15:34.535
That's very
disappointing. You have until
the end of the day. Be ready.

15:35.736 --> 15:37.337
(sighs)

15:45.278 --> 15:47.347
(Ines) So are you
ready to wow Carré?

15:47.648 --> 15:50.083
It's all under
control.
-Is it, though?

15:50.116 --> 15:54.187
Shouldn't you be
rehearsing instead of making
things for that obnoxious
mentee of yours?

15:54.220 --> 15:57.123
Oh, she's not so bad
and she's not mine. But she
will be by day's end.

15:57.558 --> 16:00.260
What are you
doing?
-I'm trying to win!

16:00.293 --> 16:05.065
Yeah, I see that. But
the only way to beat Thea is
to crush Gabrielle's choreo.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.570
You're right. What am
I doing?

16:09.603 --> 16:11.037
That's all I'm
saying.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.412
With you for a mentor,
Violette will just learn how
to take the perfect selfie

16:19.445 --> 16:21.047
and have nothing
but minions for
friends.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.049
(scoffs) And you
think she's better off with
you

16:23.083 --> 16:27.053
pretending everything is
(childish voice) all so new
and exciting!

16:27.087 --> 16:27.521
(Violette)
Hello?

16:27.554 --> 16:28.655
What?!
-What?!

16:30.290 --> 16:33.660
When my friends and I have
a disagreement we like to
find fun ways to solve it.

16:33.694 --> 16:41.668
Like... a plié relevé contest.
You're probably too old for
it, but it sure can be fun.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.615
You'll never keep up.
é
 I'm already ahead of you.

16:57.217 --> 17:00.754
(ticking and
magical tinkling
noises)

17:00.787 --> 17:04.290
(horse
neighing)

17:04.324 --> 17:07.327
When you really think about
it, we all share a common
goal.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.731
(Clive) Whoa... you want to
see all the wonders of the
world via time travel, too?

17:10.764 --> 17:12.566
What a coincidence!
Ouch.

17:17.470 --> 17:21.708
As soon as we get out
of this mess, I am going to
erase you.

17:24.745 --> 17:29.449
None of us want to be
held captive on a farm. We all
just want to get back to the
future.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.787
So let's work
together. Once we're out of
here, you can try to catch
me.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.522
(bell rings)

17:38.391 --> 17:39.626
And what did you have in
mind?

17:39.660 --> 17:43.196
There's a vent up
there. I used to hide in it
as a kid.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.098
It was the only
place my dad never found me.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.833
(Frank) And where does
it go?

17:46.867 --> 17:50.837
Not sure. But I do know
that it doesn't lead to my
uncle's farm.

17:53.774 --> 17:55.809
Clive?
-Yeah?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.010
Go up there.

17:57.043 --> 18:01.247
Why do I always get picked?
-Up you go Clive, thank you.

18:02.683 --> 18:04.417
(Clive sighs)

18:05.418 --> 18:06.620
(Frank) Twist it.
What?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.755
(Frank) Twist it.
-(grunts)

18:11.558 --> 18:13.426
(Clive grunts)

18:24.204 --> 18:25.839
(Frank) Come on,
Clive!

18:28.775 --> 18:31.111
(jiggling at the door
lock)

18:31.477 --> 18:32.546
I forgot my bag.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.486
Stay out of trouble.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.874
(both out of
breath)

19:00.907 --> 19:04.344
It's been two
hours. Had enough yet?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.214
Hardly. I feel
fantastic.

19:08.849 --> 19:11.918
You sure? You
seem pretty out of
breath.

19:11.952 --> 19:16.422
Nope. Just a breathing
technique I learned in my
yogal the other week.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.593
It's yoga, not
yogal.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.598
Okay. That's it. Ms
Carré will be here in a minute
and you're a hot mess.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.434
(Ines) If you don't
learn this ASAP, then you're
gonna fail. Which isn't cool.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.738
So... Learn the dance.
OK?

19:32.405 --> 19:33.840
(Ines)
Watch.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.878
(classical piano music
plays)

19:53.627 --> 19:56.496
(Ms Carré) I trust
you're ready, girls?

19:56.530 --> 20:02.268
Actually, I think we
should start with a
staggering amount of pliés
and relevés.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.637
Or did you learn
your lesson?

20:03.670 --> 20:04.971
(both) Yes, Ms
Carré.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.242
(Ms Carré) Ines. Thank
you for trying to stop this
childish game.

20:10.343 --> 20:14.414
And thank you for
setting an excellent example
for your mentee.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.383
Enjoy the
company rehearsal.
Learn from it.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.986
And be sure your
mentee does as well.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.321
Thank you, Ms
Carré.

20:22.723 --> 20:28.494
As for you two.
Competition between dancers is
healthy. To a point.

20:29.563 --> 20:33.600
I will not have you
wasting any more of my time,
is that clear?

20:33.634 --> 20:36.336
Well good. Let's begin.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.472
(classical piano music
plays)

20:39.506 --> 20:42.308
And... plié.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.878
Relevé.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.714
Plié.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.816
Relevé.

20:50.851 --> 20:54.621
(magical tinkling
noise)

21:03.530 --> 21:06.567
Why would you do that
to me? I need to bathe.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.570
I need my lavender
soap.

21:09.603 --> 21:13.006
You know I have a
paralytic fear of rats.
You could have warned
me.

21:13.607 --> 21:16.910
(Frank) You know,
Henri, that was actually a
pretty good idea.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.779
I'll give
you a five-second
lead.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.549
(evil laugh) One,
two... five. Let's get him.

21:39.099 --> 21:40.500
(Max) Did you see all
of that?

21:40.534 --> 21:44.337
(Dash) Only the last half
dozen or so. What's that move?
A new one?

21:44.370 --> 21:48.675
It's the move that
Paul G's dancer did. I just
can't get it right.

21:48.709 --> 21:51.645
Why are you trying to
do her move? You've got your
own.

21:51.678 --> 21:55.516
(Jeff) Too true,
dude. You've got some sick
moves.

21:55.549 --> 21:57.851
I just don't
want us to lose
again.

21:58.752 --> 22:04.024
(Jeff) The Blok isn't
just you. You can't fail for us
if we weren't all there, man.

22:04.758 --> 22:09.395
(Dash) Seems like he kinda
set you up. But together, you
know we can crush it.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.698
We need some new
moves.

22:11.732 --> 22:13.967
(Jeff) Then let's
make some up! é
 (Dash)
Let's do it!

22:14.000 --> 22:19.372
All right. I'm thinking
of something like this... but
with a twist.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.709
(Dash) Yeah
man.

22:24.010 --> 22:29.449
(Jeff) All right. Cool dude.
Alright. Like boom.
-(Laughs)

22:31.451 --> 22:34.387

plays)

22:35.622 --> 22:36.723
♪ Shake it ♪

22:36.757 --> 22:38.058
Wooh!

22:38.625 --> 22:40.561
Like this.
-Uh, uh.

22:41.061 --> 22:42.428
Yeah!

22:45.431 --> 22:46.833

22:49.469 --> 22:50.737

Uh. Yeah, nice,

Wooh.
Woohoo.

23:24.538 --> 23:26.006

23:27.774 --> 23:29.543
Yes, dude.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.920
(all
laugh)

23:40.954 --> 23:42.455
Nice.

23:44.124 --> 23:45.491
(Dash
laughs)

23:46.660 --> 23:50.496
(Jeff) Woo. Woo! See! These
moves would have blown Paul
G's mind!

23:52.165 --> 23:54.500
I'm good to sleep
here.

23:54.935 --> 23:57.170
Me too.

23:57.203 --> 24:03.009
Move. I don't want to
be near you.
-I can't. I really can't.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.559
You can have
her.

24:18.825 --> 24:22.763
No thanks. Even
though she liked my outfit.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.931
No, she didn't.

24:27.701 --> 24:30.236
ou don't mess with
the Thirds.

24:30.270 --> 24:31.872
(Thea) One girl did
that a couple of years ago

24:31.905 --> 24:34.908
and ended up in
detention for an entire year.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.643
Well, she did
cost us our ticket.

24:36.677 --> 24:38.879
And we looked
ridiculous in front of Ms
Carré.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.516
Shall I send Ms Carré
a note?

24:42.549 --> 24:45.719
I have some scented
stationery at my craft station
in my room.

24:45.752 --> 24:50.524
OK, never say
craft station ever
again. And no. We'll
send her an e-mail.

24:51.792 --> 24:54.995
Wait! Sorry! I thought some
head to head competition would
be good.

24:55.328 --> 24:59.733
You thought pitting
two dancers against each
other in the same class
would be good?

24:59.766 --> 25:01.935
We're family and
what you did was very
wrong.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.870
But everyone knows you
don't like each other.

25:04.304 --> 25:10.744
What are you talking
about? (Hesitant) Everyone
knows that I... love Lena.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.780
(hesitant) Oh right.
And, I love Thea.

25:14.080 --> 25:21.187
What's between her and I
is friendly competition. And
what you did is sabotage.

25:21.221 --> 25:25.158
Exactly. So as your
punishment you're going to
tidy my room,

25:25.191 --> 25:28.228
darn my pointe shoes
and polish my trophies.
-Really?!

25:28.795 --> 25:30.531
We'll start
there.

25:31.698 --> 25:32.999
You're going to be
her mentor?

25:33.800 --> 25:37.037
Why not? She had me
at "head to head
competition".

25:37.070 --> 25:39.205
That girl is
a diabolical
genius.

25:39.239 --> 25:40.774
Ugh. She's
vile.

25:40.807 --> 25:45.311
Correction. She's me.
And somebody needs to nurture
that kind of brilliance.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.958
(sighs)

26:06.767 --> 26:09.269
I'm leaving for
the rehearsal. Do you
need anything?

26:09.302 --> 26:12.606
How about a new pair
of feet?
-Sorry, can't help you there.

26:12.639 --> 26:13.907
How
about...

26:14.908 --> 26:19.613
Oh! Some Dead Sea bath
salts? I could really use a
nice soak.

26:19.646 --> 26:20.781
Just rub your
feet.

26:24.751 --> 26:29.055
You are so cute! Put
the ice right there on my
feet.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.324
(Ines) I thought you said
you were done trying to be a
mentor.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.627
It's important to
inspire.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.328
Oh, that's
good... that's really
good...

26:35.361 --> 26:36.663
Come on.

26:37.297 --> 26:40.734
Have fun tonight!
And thank you.

26:41.201 --> 26:43.637
There's some origami
over there.

26:45.205 --> 26:46.773
(squeals with
excitement)
