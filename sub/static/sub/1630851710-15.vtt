00:01.175 --> 00:03.046
<i>Previously this season</i> <i>
on "Vanderpump Rules"...</i>

00:03.090 --> 00:05.440
My angel, my beauty,

00:05.483 --> 00:07.094
it would be my honor

00:07.137 --> 00:10.053
if you...will...marry me.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.141
Yes.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.756
Welcome to the spot,
soon to be Schwartz & Sandy's.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.541
Okay, so it's clearly
not open then.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.630
It's a progress party,
but the point

00:21.673 --> 00:24.285
of a progress party
is to see progress.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.503
Remember when I was like,
"It's okay, Randall,

00:25.547 --> 00:27.505
when I have a business,
you can invest."

00:27.549 --> 00:29.420
Schwartz and I have talked
about, like, doing

00:29.464 --> 00:32.075
a sandwich shop. Ariana's like,
"I'll ----ing do it with you."

00:32.119 --> 00:33.250
No way.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.686
Conceptually, what is it?

00:34.730 --> 00:37.124
Unapologetically feminine.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.516
Hopefully the numbers make sense
with my team.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.518
And if they do,
I'll let you know this weekend.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.086
You and I have built
a really good friendship,

00:43.130 --> 00:45.436
and in the last couple months,
you haven't been a good friend.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.611
I will be better.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.222
You need to learn how
to talk to people.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.572
And you don't need to learn
how to ----ing talk?

00:50.615 --> 00:52.487
Duh-duh-duh-duh!

00:52.530 --> 00:55.229
What do you think about
throwing an engagement party?

00:55.272 --> 00:58.580
Santa Ynez, here we come!

00:58.623 --> 00:59.885
So excited.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.844
Honey, will you be my wife?

01:01.887 --> 01:03.672
- Of course.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.717
That was gonna be a surprise
shotgun wedding for ya,

01:05.761 --> 01:09.112
but the only time we have
is when we go away this week.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.592
We'll sneak away in the morning.

01:10.635 --> 01:13.073
- We'll be secretly married.
- Ooh.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.082
No ----ing way.

01:28.610 --> 01:32.266
<i>♪ You know that it's our time</i>

01:32.309 --> 01:36.879
<i>♪ These are the best days</i> <i>
of our lives ♪</i>

01:36.922 --> 01:40.230
<i>♪ Just raise your glasses high</i>

01:40.274 --> 01:45.322
<i>♪ This one's for you tonight</i>

01:47.281 --> 01:50.153

01:53.635 --> 01:55.724
<i>♪ Yeah, you know</i>

01:55.767 --> 01:58.205
<i>♪ We've been through it all</i>

01:58.248 --> 02:01.425
<i>♪ Been through it all</i>

02:04.994 --> 02:06.604
- Good morning.
- Hmm.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.476
This engagement party
is becoming

02:08.519 --> 02:11.740
really elaborate and expensive,

02:11.783 --> 02:13.655
and there's still so much to do,

02:13.698 --> 02:18.268
but I want everyone to cherish
these moments in Santa Ynez.

02:18.312 --> 02:21.271
I can't even imagine what
our wedding might look like.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.839
I can kind of, like, suss out
mathematically in my head

02:23.882 --> 02:25.623
if this party costs this much...

02:25.667 --> 02:28.278
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, times it by 5.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.802
8 a.m. sharp, time to get up.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.543
You know, I'm pretty sure
your mom said a couple times

02:32.587 --> 02:34.458
that she was paying
for the wedding.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.895
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh</i>

02:41.683 --> 02:43.250
I feel like I'm dressed
like the dad

02:43.293 --> 02:45.817
who wakes up super early and
wants to do a lot of activities.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.297
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.907
"I woke up at 5:30,
and I'm judging you guys

02:48.951 --> 02:50.822
for not waking up
when I woke up."

02:53.651 --> 02:55.871
You gonna pick us up?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.351
Okay if I jump right in.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.613
Whoo!

02:58.656 --> 03:01.659
Come on, party animals.
Get outta here.

03:01.703 --> 03:04.445
- Oh, you got that?

03:04.488 --> 03:06.621
- Aye-aye.
- Oh, my God!

03:06.664 --> 03:09.972
Wow! This is amazing.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.800
- All aboard!
- Whoa, honey.

03:11.843 --> 03:12.844
We made it.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.673
Hey, by the way,
Morpheus called.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.545
Aren't I straight out
of "The Matrix"?

03:17.588 --> 03:22.898
I'm stuck on this boat,
sun beating down on me

03:22.941 --> 03:25.814
in a ----ing leather jacket.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.381
Lala, this should be
your everyday look.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.686
I know, because it's a vibe.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.558
I will say, though,
being called Morpheus

03:30.601 --> 03:32.560
is like the chicest thing
I've ever been called.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.301
- We are off!
- Whoo!

03:34.344 --> 03:36.564
Santa Barbara pier,
look at this.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.348
Ahoy there!
Look at these seals.

03:38.392 --> 03:42.352
- It's a cuddle puddle.
- Cuddle puddle.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.702
- Who had the Irish coffee?
- Right here.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.269
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.923
- Who had the beer?
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

03:47.966 --> 03:50.578
Whoo! Michelob! For the ho!

03:50.621 --> 03:54.321
All right, let's go.
"Boat life" on 3. 1, 2, 3!

03:54.364 --> 03:55.539
Boat life!

03:55.583 --> 03:56.975
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

03:57.019 --> 03:58.716
I'm on a boat, bitch.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.677
This is what--
this concerns me, man.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.461
- What?
- Just being out here.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.549
Why?

04:05.593 --> 04:06.855
'Cause I'm just ready to retire.

04:06.898 --> 04:10.554
- We're gonna get there, though.
- I hope so.

04:10.598 --> 04:14.036
I think these are, like,
very subtle microaggressions

04:14.079 --> 04:18.432
coming out about the fact that
we're so far behind in the bar.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.912
- Who?
- Lisa--Katie relates to me

04:20.956 --> 04:23.915
the fact that she was expressing
disappointment.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.874
- Lisa came.
- What's she up to?

04:25.917 --> 04:27.919
She's definitely, like,
a little disappointed

04:27.963 --> 04:32.620
that you guys are, like,
stuck where you are at.

04:32.663 --> 04:35.013
- We're already super stressed.
- I know.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.928
It's, like, been a lot
for the past couple months

04:36.972 --> 04:38.756
of her just being, like,
"What are you guys doing?"

04:38.800 --> 04:40.018
Yeah.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.455
Like,
"Why are you wasting time?"

04:41.498 --> 04:42.804
It's like,
we're not wasting time.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.762
The thing is, Tom,
when I first moved out here,

04:44.806 --> 04:47.939
I just had, like,
raw fire burning in my stomach.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.506
I didn't know what the
I was gonna do

04:49.550 --> 04:51.421
when I got out here.
I just believed in it.

04:51.465 --> 04:52.596
Yeah.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.382
I have that same fire
with the new spot.

04:55.425 --> 04:59.473
And with the team that we have,
I feel like we'll pull it off.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.562
Cheers to an early retirement.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.390
I wanna be playing
in the World Series of Poker.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.914
I wanna live probably in, like,
Thousand Oaks and have a ranch

05:05.957 --> 05:09.483
with, like, pigs, goats,
lizards, maybe a cow,

05:09.526 --> 05:11.049
like, one of those mini ones.

05:11.093 --> 05:14.662
I wanna do, like, a cover band.
I wanna travel the world.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.707
- Early retirement.
- Yeah.

05:16.751 --> 05:20.015
Hold on a sec. Yeah.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.973
Not too early, though.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.453
Yeah.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.810
Yes!

05:34.856 --> 05:36.074
Why is Tom's butt so big?

05:36.118 --> 05:38.642
- Yeah. It's juicy.

05:38.686 --> 05:39.991
Aah!

05:40.035 --> 05:41.776
Oh, my God.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.386
Oh, I'm gonna hit the beat.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.736
Whoo!

05:45.780 --> 05:47.782
Yeah!

05:47.825 --> 05:49.131
I thought that giving James
a lap dance

05:49.174 --> 05:51.394
would be kinda cute
and a little sexy,

05:51.438 --> 05:54.876
but it's actually a lot harder
to do on a moving boat.

06:00.534 --> 06:04.015
Are you drinking?

06:04.059 --> 06:05.495
Oh, yeah!

06:05.539 --> 06:08.498
Tom, you put so much sunscreen
on your face,

06:08.542 --> 06:11.806
you look like you dipped
your head into a bag of cocaine.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.200
Or that I...

06:15.244 --> 06:16.680
It goes with your outfit,
honestly.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.552
You look like a cocaine lord.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.815
Ariana, Goldie Hawn
from "Overboard" called.

06:20.858 --> 06:21.990
Ooh.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.862
Lala, do you have any updog?

06:24.906 --> 06:26.995
- What is updog?
- Oh! Yeah, you so--

06:27.038 --> 06:29.432
Oh! Not much.
What's up with you?

06:29.476 --> 06:32.870
Oh, man.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.568
All right, here we go. Are you
gonna shotgun a Red Bull?

06:34.611 --> 06:37.701
Yeah, I haven't shotgun sh--
in a while.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.574
- Yeah!
- By the way, James...

06:40.617 --> 06:42.227
Dude, last night was shocking
to me.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.578
If you can accept my apology,
like, I don't hold any grudges

06:44.621 --> 06:45.970
and you--I promise you,
you don't need to.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.538
You don't need to walk
around eggshells.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.932
- He handled himself very well.
- He did.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.455
What?!

06:52.499 --> 06:54.849
Better save some of that.
Oh, my God!

06:54.892 --> 06:56.590
Bitch!

06:56.633 --> 06:58.853
I mean, he's a really
charismatic guy...

06:58.896 --> 06:59.941
- Yeah.
-...in general.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.899
So even if it was like

07:01.943 --> 07:03.684
he's putting on the charm
a little bit,

07:03.727 --> 07:05.903
I have more patience
than others

07:05.947 --> 07:07.992
because this is
a group of people

07:08.036 --> 07:10.734
who really, truly
love each other,

07:10.778 --> 07:12.388
and if we're fighting
about something,

07:12.432 --> 07:16.436
it's because we want to resolve
that and be better friends.

07:18.133 --> 07:21.092
- We're all, like, tired of...
- Watch your head.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.617
When we were
at the paint and sip...

07:23.660 --> 07:24.922
Yeah, you and Brock,

07:24.966 --> 07:26.097
like, walked away
for a minute.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.577
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.100
I did tell him if we can do it,
we can do it, but--

07:29.144 --> 07:32.016
You're ready to pull the plug
if something's not right.

07:33.931 --> 07:39.850
So... I've slept on it.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.026
I don't feel right doing it.

07:42.070 --> 07:45.769
I'm having second thoughts
about this whole secret wedding.

07:45.813 --> 07:49.512
As much as I know
I want to marry Brock,

07:49.556 --> 07:52.036
I don't wanna do it in this way.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.779
I feel like we need to put
what we want on hold

07:55.823 --> 07:56.954
out of respect for our friends.

07:56.998 --> 07:59.783
- I am a people pleaser.
- We both are.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.524
And I will do what
everyone else wants,

08:01.568 --> 08:03.787
and I'm like, okay, if this is
what you, Tom, and Ariana

08:03.831 --> 08:05.876
think is a good idea...
- They probably don't--

08:05.920 --> 08:07.182
-...then I would just do it.
- Take Tom and Ariana--

08:07.225 --> 08:08.749
But then it's like,
but then I'm not happy.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.228
This isn't what I want.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.579
But I wish I had
my ----ing ring on right now.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.755
I wish I could go tell
everybody.

08:14.798 --> 08:18.628
I respect that this weekend
is about James and Raquel,

08:18.672 --> 08:22.153
but I still had something
huge and significant

08:22.197 --> 08:24.765
happen in my life,

08:24.808 --> 08:27.158
and I just want my friends
to be happy for me.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.247
Are you gonna talk to the girls?

08:29.291 --> 08:32.642
We'll see when
the right time is,

08:32.686 --> 08:33.643
like when it feels right.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.646
Obviously, not at their party.

08:36.690 --> 08:40.824
James and Raquel have a lot
of family coming in.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.130
So, you know, they got
50 people, so it'll be--

08:42.173 --> 08:46.221
Well, that--it's their big,
huge, amazing day.

08:46.264 --> 08:48.919
I mean, I'm not trying to do
something ----ing dickish.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.355
No.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.966
Like, there can't be
any ----ing weird vibes.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.011
- It can't be like that at all.
- No. No!

08:56.361 --> 08:57.624
<i>Coming up...</i>

08:57.667 --> 08:59.756
I would like to make a toast.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.064

- Alpacas.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.340
I love
their little fresh haircuts.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.603
- Yay!
- Welcome.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.387
Welcome to Canzelle Alpacas.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.346
- Thank you.
- My name is Brad.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.783
This is Rosie, and this is
my mother, Carol-Ann.

09:26.827 --> 09:29.177
- Hi, Carol-Ann. Hi, Rosie!
- Hi, Rosie.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.265
Very nice to have you guys.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.223
I don't know
if we're zoned for it,

09:32.267 --> 09:34.617
but I would 100% adopt
a baby alpaca

09:34.661 --> 09:37.359
with Tom or just, like,
on my own.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.621
Like, I don't even need him.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.231
I'm so excited.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.277
Did you know that the alpaca is

09:42.320 --> 09:45.323
the smallest member
of the camel family?

09:45.367 --> 09:48.152
- Oh, excellent.
- He Googled that.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.203
- Hi there.
- How are you?

09:55.246 --> 09:57.684
Good. Welcome to Santa Ynez
Valley Horseback Rides.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.163
Thank you. I'm James.
Nice to meet you.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.600
Nice to meet you. Vanessa.
I'm the barn manager here.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.297
- Raquel. Nice to meet you.
- Raquel, nice to meet you.

10:02.340 --> 10:05.387
Hi, Vanessa. We are expecting
our friend also,

10:05.430 --> 10:07.215
so she will be joining us.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.303
Okay, so we have
one more person coming.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.391
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.138
The alpaca is
a domesticated animal.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.661
Oh, my God.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.663
They started being domesticated
about 6,000 years ago

10:20.707 --> 10:22.230
in South America.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.275
I feel like Brock
is the zoologist

10:24.319 --> 10:25.450
straight out of "Jumanji,"

10:25.494 --> 10:27.539
just rattling off
these alpaca facts.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.150
Did you know...

10:29.193 --> 10:33.154
Did you know that there are
22 different colored alpacas?

10:33.197 --> 10:35.504
Whether he's getting it off
Google off his phone,

10:35.547 --> 10:38.594
he is saying it with just
so much intention behind it,

10:38.638 --> 10:40.117
I'm very impressed.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.424
Listen, the delivery
is the confidence.

10:42.467 --> 10:43.730
These are all ladies,

10:43.773 --> 10:45.645
and they like to go
to the toilet together,

10:45.688 --> 10:48.430
just like you ladies do.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.127
Wow, Brock's trying to get
a job.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.130
- Oh, they're mating.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.697
That's what Randall sounds like
when he wants to mate.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.307
That was cute.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.617
- Oh, look at her.
- Nuh-uh.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.619
You know, he's the oldest guy.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.316
Are they gonna fight?
That looks like a fight.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.276
Or they're gonna

11:13.368 --> 11:14.935
Which it's like, yeah,
we were, like, excited

11:14.978 --> 11:17.459
to get it done, but then I was
like, not on their property.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.896
I just don't want it to seem
like we're trying

11:19.940 --> 11:23.291
to steal their thunder,
'cause we're not.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.772
Hey, guys.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.512
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!

11:27.556 --> 11:29.340
- This suits you.
- Thank you.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.603
- I'm liking this.

11:31.647 --> 11:32.735
We're gonna take
a nice, beautiful ride

11:32.779 --> 11:34.345
to the Santa Ynez Valley
riverbed.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.652
- Can you ride?
- Yeah. I'm not bad.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.828
That's a lie.
Should we go, then?

11:38.872 --> 11:41.222
All right, let's go,
get you guys on your horses.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.575
- 1, 2, 3.
- Oh.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.229
All right, here we go.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.757
You're so used to acting
like the horse's ass,

11:54.801 --> 11:57.238
I can't believe you've never
been on one.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.678
Oh, that was a good one.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.941
Here we go!

12:04.985 --> 12:07.552
- It's so romantic.
- It really is.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.467
It would be romantic
without me.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.688
A little ménage à trois.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.823
Oh, my gosh!

12:16.866 --> 12:18.694
Oh, wow.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.217
You wanna get married
right here?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.828
- Hi!
- Isn't it perfect?

12:21.871 --> 12:25.701
Lisa, you said a picnic.
I wasn't expecting this.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.442
James has always been
a wild card,

12:27.485 --> 12:28.835
but I'm rooting for him,

12:28.878 --> 12:31.011
and I'm rooting
for this marriage.

12:31.054 --> 12:35.015
And I hope that James realizes
how lucky he is

12:35.058 --> 12:37.844
to have a woman like this
in his life.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.236
Thanks so much
for everything.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.847
- This picnic is...
- This is incredible.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.326
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- When you said "picnic,"

12:42.370 --> 12:43.980
I didn't really--
Like, I should have known,

12:44.024 --> 12:46.287
like, Lisa Vanderpump isn't
gonna be sitting on the ground.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.463
There's gonna be a little
blanket on the floor somewhere?

12:48.506 --> 12:50.465
I was expecting, you know,
big, red blanket

12:50.508 --> 12:51.596
with a basket.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.076
It was actually quite selfish
of me,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.557
because I wanted to have
a bit of you guys to myself

12:55.600 --> 12:58.516
because I know you're gonna be
spread very thin.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.823
- Ah!
- And I wanted to talk to you.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.520
I want the best for you, okay?

13:02.564 --> 13:04.914
- I know.
- There's nobody on this planet

13:04.958 --> 13:06.655
apart from Raquel,
your mother, and your father,

13:06.698 --> 13:08.613
that want the best for you.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.878
I've seen what a wonderful match
Raquel is for James.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.968
This is the best chance
that James Kennedy

13:15.011 --> 13:17.622
is ever going to be given.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.755
I don't want him
to screw this up.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.062
Sometimes I have these setbacks,
and I know that I make myself

13:22.105 --> 13:24.586
look like a fool, and I say
some foolish stuff sometimes,

13:24.629 --> 13:27.067
but you've helped me so much
in my life.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.633
I wouldn't be where I am
right now

13:28.677 --> 13:32.420
if it wasn't for you,
you know? And Raquel.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.727
You've come so far,
but there's still a way to go.

13:35.771 --> 13:36.946
I know that.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.295
Lisa's blessing means
everything to me.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.907
I mean, part of this journey
is Lisa.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.822
She was the first person
telling me

13:42.865 --> 13:44.388
that I had to stop drinking.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.348
We understand that
you turned up loaded.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.306
Grow the up.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.700
You're turning into an asshole
before my very eyes.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.921
If I catch you drinking...
we're done.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.401
You need to be sober
for the rest of your life.

13:57.445 --> 14:00.927
I'm telling you that.
You have to get help.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.407
She's one of the most important
people in my life.

14:03.451 --> 14:07.020
- Cheers to you guys.
- Thank you. Cheers.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.848
I'm in your corner.
You remember that.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.634
Oh, how pretty is this?

14:12.677 --> 14:14.592
I love this.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.420
- Whoo!

14:16.464 --> 14:17.639
- Alpacas!
- Happy alpacas!

14:17.682 --> 14:20.468
- Alpacas!

14:21.861 --> 14:24.907
Okay. So once everyone gets
champagne.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.518
You know what? You guys are such
a sweet, enthusiastic group.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.827
What's up?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.917
Oh, I'm stuck on there.

14:34.961 --> 14:38.660
I would like to make a toast.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.488
You want me to stand up
with you?

14:43.970 --> 14:46.798
Uh-huh.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.800
Um...

14:48.844 --> 14:51.368
Scheana and I have something
to tell you guys.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.983
We got engaged a few days ago.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.858
What the is going on?

15:02.902 --> 15:06.775
The ring is stunning.
It's massive.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.517
But I was like, I'm not wearing
my ring this weekend,

15:09.560 --> 15:12.781
because I do not want anyone
to think

15:12.824 --> 15:14.652
I'm trying to make this weekend
about us.

15:14.696 --> 15:18.004
What the
are you talking about?

15:18.047 --> 15:21.921
In real time, we're watching you
make this about you.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.053
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, congratulations.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.534
- Cheers, guys.
- Yeah!

15:26.577 --> 15:28.405
Whoo!

15:30.103 --> 15:32.714
And we came up this weekend

15:32.757 --> 15:34.716
with a little bit
of a side hustle plan.

15:38.589 --> 15:41.723
We were thinking about coming up
here and trying to sneak away

15:41.766 --> 15:43.725
to do something ceremoniously.

15:43.768 --> 15:47.859
The only people that know
in this room, real quick,

15:47.903 --> 15:51.080
were these two.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.737
We were just thinking, what if
we could just sneak away

15:55.780 --> 15:57.521
with Tom Sandoval...
- No.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.437
...and just, like, make it
official on some paper?

16:00.481 --> 16:03.092
Dude. What the [bleep]?

16:03.136 --> 16:05.051
They would find out.
They would've found out,

16:05.094 --> 16:06.704
and they would've been pissed.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.010
It was not sitting right
with me,

16:08.054 --> 16:09.229
but I was just trying
to be typical Scheana,

16:09.272 --> 16:10.708
like, people please, like,
"If this is what

16:10.752 --> 16:12.101
you really wanna do,
then, like, okay, we'll do it,"

16:12.145 --> 16:14.756
and then when I talked to Tom
last night,

16:14.799 --> 16:17.019
he was like, "I'm out,"
I was like, me, too, me, too.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.629
I was like, abort, abort.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.937
It's wrong.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.940
But also, like,
I'm kinda living for it.

16:26.463 --> 16:30.032
We would appreciate if you guys
just keep this here,

16:30.076 --> 16:34.602
because we will talk to James
and Raquel ourselves.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.865
We look forward to when
it's gonna happen.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.823
So here's to being better
with each other,

16:38.867 --> 16:40.956
and I love you forever.
- I love you.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.044
To Brock and Scheana!

16:42.088 --> 16:44.046
To Brock and Scheana
and the alpacas.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.789
<i>Coming up...</i>

16:47.832 --> 16:49.138
I'm so happy you're here, Dad.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.489
James and I have come
such a long way,

16:52.533 --> 16:53.969
and I know he wanted to get
your blessing.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.799
I know, and I didn't say no.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.540
I didn't say yes.

17:08.549 --> 17:09.724
Time to get pretty.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.813
Oh, my God, you look stunning,
Katie.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.771
Thanks.

17:16.644 --> 17:17.688
Earth goddess glam.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.649
Steaming dresses.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.738
We are steaming!

17:23.781 --> 17:27.089
Oh, I found Tom. Two Toms.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.352
That's where Schwartz is gonna
be sleeping tonight.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.701
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yeah.

17:30.745 --> 17:31.789
So you're gonna lay
on the floor?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.443
- Yeah.
- All right.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.753
Oh! It's so pretty!

17:38.796 --> 17:41.495
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

17:41.538 --> 17:42.844
Hey, you.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.846
- Oh! Missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.543
So what's going on?

17:46.587 --> 17:48.719
Setting everything up.
How does it look?

17:48.763 --> 17:51.418
Gorgeous.
Show me what you got going on.

17:51.461 --> 17:55.117
We have our catering
with delicious food,

17:55.161 --> 17:56.640
and then the bar
is gonna be to the left.

17:56.684 --> 17:57.989
Okay.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.731
Everything looks so beautiful.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.256
Even though it was
a lot of pennies,

18:03.299 --> 18:05.345
it was worth every penny.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.434
I'm so happy you're here, Dad.

18:07.477 --> 18:09.218
James and I have come
such a long way,

18:09.262 --> 18:11.568
and I know he wanted
to get your blessing.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.917
I know.

18:12.961 --> 18:16.660
And I didn't say no.
I didn't say yes.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.836
He invited me out on a hike,

18:18.880 --> 18:21.143
and when I showed up,
the first thing that I saw

18:21.187 --> 18:22.449
that he wasn't wearing
hiking boots,

18:22.492 --> 18:24.146
and I bought him a nice pair
of hiking boots.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.539
- Yeah.
- And I said, okay,

18:25.582 --> 18:27.106
this is not about hiking.
This is something else.

18:27.149 --> 18:30.674
And about five minutes into it,
he asked for my blessing.

18:30.718 --> 18:35.505
And I said, "Well, if I say no,
do we go back to the car now?"

18:35.549 --> 18:38.204
I talked to him about what it
was like to be a good husband

18:38.247 --> 18:39.944
and what I would expect
from him.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.772
My dad's always been
protective of me,

18:41.816 --> 18:45.559
and he has a very strange sense
of humor.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.736
I think his goal
is to scare James straight,

18:48.779 --> 18:53.436
so he knows his baby girl
is being taken care of.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.396
At the end of the day,
you gave James your blessing.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.745
Well, I didn't say it was
a blessing,

18:57.788 --> 18:59.312
but I welcomed him as a member
of the family.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.575
And that's your way of saying--

19:01.618 --> 19:04.578
That's the best I can do.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.449
- Come here.
- Love you, Dad.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.886
Love you.
Do the right thing.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.714
I am. Do you trust me
to do the right thing?

19:10.758 --> 19:11.889
Yes.

19:16.372 --> 19:19.288
Psst.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.943
- It's happening.
- Mama!

19:21.986 --> 19:23.597
You look so good.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.556
This is amazing.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.819
So I'm assuming your dad
isn't coming

19:28.863 --> 19:30.865
'cause there's restrictions
and stuff over there, right?

19:30.908 --> 19:33.781
He's not coming,
so you can relax.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.348
Hey.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.827
Hi!

19:36.871 --> 19:38.699
Keeping it gangsta?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.657
London gangsta.

19:40.701 --> 19:41.876
- He'll be here for the wedding.
- Yes.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.704
Yeah. So it'll be fun.

19:43.747 --> 19:47.229
So who else is here?
Laura just arrived with Carey.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.013
Laura, got friends coming.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.015
Buttons!
- Ahh!

19:51.059 --> 19:52.669
Oh, my gosh.

19:52.713 --> 19:55.237
Double. Mwah!
- Mwah!

19:55.281 --> 19:56.934
I miss you so much.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.459
Raquel is so happy
to have you here.

19:59.502 --> 20:00.808
- Guest of honor.
- They are.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.288
- James!
- Hello!

20:02.331 --> 20:04.855
Jacqueline!
My future son-in-law.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.509
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Oh, my God.

20:06.553 --> 20:10.470
- So happy to see you.
- Mother-in-law. Ooh!

20:10.513 --> 20:12.254
- How are you?
- I'm good.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.777
- My little girl.
- Hi, Buttons.

20:13.821 --> 20:14.865
- I see Raquel.
- She's so happy.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.476
I'm so happy.

20:16.519 --> 20:20.393
- Family.
- Hi! You look beautiful.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.524
Mwah.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.483
I expected it to be this big.

20:23.526 --> 20:24.832
- Yes?
- Yeah.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.748
Did James meet
your expectations?

20:27.791 --> 20:30.490
- Yes, for a starter ring.
- Oh.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.056
- You look so gorgeous.
- You look wonderful.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.364
- Like a really, like, hot mama.
- It's hot. It's super--Aw!

20:35.408 --> 20:37.888
- I mean, you're hot.

20:37.932 --> 20:41.283
Two years ago, I never would've
expected Laura and my mom

20:41.327 --> 20:44.373
getting along so well, you know,
chatting away,

20:44.417 --> 20:45.896
cracking jokes.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.551
It's an engagement party
miracle. Hallelujah.

20:48.595 --> 20:49.944
- Mom.
- Mom.

20:49.987 --> 20:53.382
- Laura.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.558
Pose with the models.

20:55.602 --> 20:56.516
Yes, that's it.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.952
- Hi, sir.
- How you doing?

20:57.995 --> 20:59.910
- Ohh.
- Good to see you.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.956
So happy. I can't believe it.
I can't believe it. Yeah.

21:01.999 --> 21:06.308
Like, grab a drink there
and enjoy. Enjoy.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.310
So many important people here,
so many people that I love.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.965
My brothers are here.
My best friends are here.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.445
There he is! Mm.
What's up, brother?

21:12.488 --> 21:14.055
How you doing? You all right?

21:14.098 --> 21:15.752
- How are you?
- Yeah.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.277
Then I've got Buttons here.
Grandma Buttons is here.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.541
it, why don't we just
get married today?

21:21.584 --> 21:26.850
Next step, I think, it'd be nice
to welcome everybody

21:26.894 --> 21:27.808
with a speech.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.592
Are you nervous for your speech?

21:29.636 --> 21:32.073
- I was a little bit nervous.
- Yeah.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.336
But after seeing
all of our friends

21:34.380 --> 21:37.644
and family and how happy
everyone is to be here,

21:37.687 --> 21:40.473
I feel just, like, overwhelmed
with love.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.953
You've been practicing.
You've been doing your...

21:42.997 --> 21:45.347
You know what I mean?
You've been warming up

21:45.391 --> 21:46.435
for this moment, okay?
- Yeah.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.132
I have a fear
of public speaking.

21:48.176 --> 21:51.092
It's just something that I've
struggled with all my life.

21:51.135 --> 21:53.442
I think from that moment,
clink the glass,

21:53.486 --> 21:55.444
take a moment just to feel
the love and appreciation

21:55.488 --> 21:57.794
and just kinda speak from there.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.361
I have to remind myself that

21:59.405 --> 22:00.623
people wanna hear what I have
to say.

22:00.667 --> 22:04.148
- 100%. I know I do.
- Aw.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.849
Buttons, eh? Come on, Buttons.
You want a hand? Give it here.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.460
Let's go, Buttons. Sorry, honey.
Come in, too.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.158
Do you wanna come meet
Lisa Vanderpump?

22:14.202 --> 22:17.466
Yes, I have to meet
Lisa Vanderpump.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.469
Look at you. Mom, this is
the queen of Beverly Hills.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.818
- Not really.
- Did you know that?

22:21.862 --> 22:23.559
Yes, she really is.

22:23.603 --> 22:24.734
I'm Charli.

22:24.778 --> 22:25.909
I've heard a lot about you,
Charli.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.433
- You're James' mom?
- I am.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.043
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you. So do you.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.741
- You've got this, baby.
- Okay.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.572
I'd love to make a toast.

22:36.616 --> 22:39.967
- Hey!
- I want to thank everyone--

22:40.010 --> 22:41.490
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:41.534 --> 22:42.839
if we could just get you
to quiet for two minutes,

22:42.883 --> 22:44.406
we've got a lot
of little speech prepared

22:44.450 --> 22:47.409
with my lovely, beautiful
fiancée Raquel. Make some noise.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.894
Thank you guys so much
for coming tonight.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.462
I feel so blessed.

22:56.505 --> 23:00.074
It's just so nice to have
both of our families here.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.467
- Whoo!

23:01.510 --> 23:03.512
"I remember when I met James.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.427
I thought he was super cute
by the DJ booth."

23:05.471 --> 23:08.822
I remember the first time I laid
my eyes on James.

23:08.865 --> 23:13.653
I thought he was super cute.
I was at PUMP New Year's Eve

23:13.696 --> 23:15.568
with my sister Kate.

23:15.611 --> 23:19.223
Once I heard his accent,
it was game over.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.793
Two years ago,
James made the decision

23:23.837 --> 23:25.926
to quit drinking alcohol.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.667
"It's brought so much positive
light and love

23:27.710 --> 23:29.016
into our relationship."

23:29.059 --> 23:32.454
It has brought so much positive
light and love

23:32.498 --> 23:34.151
into our relationship.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.544
Is James telling her
what to say?

23:35.588 --> 23:37.677
"And it wasn't long
after he quit drinking,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.896
we took a trip to Joshua Tree."
- Literally.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.507
It was then that I was like,

23:41.550 --> 23:44.466
"James, I'm ready for you
to propose."

23:47.208 --> 23:48.818
We see.

23:48.862 --> 23:53.475
So I was expecting a proposal,
and James surprised me

23:53.519 --> 23:57.087
with an incredible Stagecoach--
Oh, sorry. Coachella.

23:57.131 --> 24:00.656
Sorry, guys, I'm so nervous.
James surprised me

24:00.700 --> 24:05.574
with such a thoughtful proposal,
and that just shows me

24:05.618 --> 24:09.056
he's going to be dedicated
to me for the rest of my life,

24:09.099 --> 24:11.537
and I feel the same way
about him.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.544
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.

24:21.721 --> 24:26.247
I feel like I'm so embarrassed.
Like, an ideal speech,

24:26.290 --> 24:30.904
I feel like looks so beautiful
and perfect in my mind.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.994
But it's just something that

24:34.037 --> 24:38.302
I feel like
I can't really ever reach.

24:38.346 --> 24:41.828
- Oh, my God!
- You did it!

24:41.871 --> 24:44.178
You did it!

24:46.267 --> 24:49.879
- Was it horrible?
- No, it was so good. Beautiful.

24:49.923 --> 24:53.883
I have grown as a person
since meeting James.

24:53.927 --> 24:58.105
He's brought out a better,
stronger version of myself.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.150
It was such a beautiful moment.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.849
And I feel so grateful
for that.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.852
<i>Coming up...</i>

25:05.895 --> 25:07.680
He wanted to get married here
this weekend.

25:07.723 --> 25:08.811
You can't get married

25:08.855 --> 25:10.639
at somebody else's
engagement party.

25:10.683 --> 25:11.814
Well, not at their party.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.642
We were gonna do it, like,
yesterday.

25:13.686 --> 25:14.687
- No, Scheana.
- But then--

25:17.559 --> 25:19.387
<i>♪ I got my shades on</i>

25:19.430 --> 25:20.519
<i>♪ I got my nails done</i>

25:20.562 --> 25:23.739
<i>♪ I slay, I slay</i>

25:23.783 --> 25:26.176
I cannot stop crying.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.527
Katie and I
are not just emotional

25:28.570 --> 25:30.354
because of Raquel's speech...

25:30.398 --> 25:32.356
- I wondered.
-...and this amazing moment,

25:32.400 --> 25:34.054
but, um--
- Why are you so tearful?

25:34.097 --> 25:36.056
- We just--Well, first--
- We just spoke to...

25:36.099 --> 25:37.318
- Randall.
- Randall.

25:37.361 --> 25:41.191
And, um, he said that
he and his partners

25:41.235 --> 25:43.454
want to invest $150,000...
- A hundred and--

25:43.498 --> 25:45.282
-...into getting our...
- You're gonna make me cry.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.806
...into getting
our shop started.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.722
You guys are so passionate
about your business,

25:49.765 --> 25:51.375
and I just want you to know

25:51.419 --> 25:52.681
we'd like to invest
in this restaurant.

25:52.725 --> 25:53.639
- Really?

25:53.682 --> 25:55.684
I have chills!

25:55.728 --> 25:58.600
Wipe your tears, girls!
You're on your way.

25:58.644 --> 26:02.604
- It's really exciting.
- It's really exciting.

26:02.648 --> 26:05.215
Okay, well, go.
Let's go ahead, girls.

26:05.259 --> 26:06.826
- Yes!
- Thank you, Lisa,

26:06.869 --> 26:07.870
for everything that you did
to help us. Thank you.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.785
- Oh, of course!
- Thank you.

26:09.829 --> 26:12.309
And let's leave those guys
in the dust.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.224
I can't reach my arm.
I have small...

26:15.443 --> 26:18.315
I'm really hopeful
for Katie and Ariana.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.404
They've come a long way.
They really have.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.319
They have the vision.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.278
Now they've gotta have
the execution.

26:24.321 --> 26:28.543
Schwartz and I are very proud
of you guys for doing this.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.198
The only time I'll ever,
and anybody--

26:31.241 --> 26:34.331
like, any one of us would ever,
like, speak up or say anything

26:34.375 --> 26:38.509
is, like, you know, if--if--
if there was just like a--

26:38.553 --> 26:40.120
If we don't like the name
or something.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.731
Yeah, if we don't like the name
or, uh, I'm just kidding.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.690
- Oh, sit back down!
- I'm joking.

26:44.733 --> 26:47.518
Schwartz, how long would that
have taken you to do?

26:47.562 --> 26:49.259
A couple years?

26:49.303 --> 26:53.786
If you want something done,
the job, give it to a woman.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.314
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.881
I'm having
a little Vanderpump rosé.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.534
- You are?
- Yes.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.624
Hi, Bubba.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.278
Okay. Hold on. I want my drink.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.237
Where are we going?

27:10.280 --> 27:11.542
We're gonna go gossip.

27:11.586 --> 27:14.154
I have something very expensive
in my purse

27:14.197 --> 27:16.547
that I wanted to show you.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.289
What's that?

27:19.333 --> 27:20.769
- That's an engagement ring?
- Mm-hmm.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.379
- You got engaged?
- Mm-hmm.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.164
You cannot get engaged.

27:24.207 --> 27:25.295
No, it didn't happen here.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.341
It happened a few days ago
at home.

27:27.384 --> 27:32.912
This, like, whole, like,
alpaca farm bomb drop...

27:32.955 --> 27:36.480
'Kay, are you--
are you having tequila?

27:36.524 --> 27:38.657
No, this is just some vodka
in here.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.875
How many are you in?

27:39.919 --> 27:42.617
- Like, this is my third.
- How you feeling?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.140
- Good.

27:44.184 --> 27:48.754
- What? I feel good. Whatever.
- I was so shook, Katie.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.799
First of all,
you come to me and Randall,

27:50.843 --> 27:53.889
and, like, somewhat expect us
to, like, kinda foot the bill.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.892
There's a rooftop place in L.A.
Here that I wanna go to

27:56.936 --> 27:59.765
and have you host
a movie premiere.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.810
Everyone's gonna get dressed up.

28:01.854 --> 28:02.681
And they think they're coming
to a movie of mine.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.160
- Movie of yours.
- Done.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.945
- See, listen, Brock, we--
- And now he's, like, trying

28:05.988 --> 28:07.816
to hide behind theirs, like, oh,
we'll just do it at the venue

28:07.860 --> 28:11.690
that James and Raquel paid for?
Like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.039
Do not mention it.
You cannot steal their thunder.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.823
I'm not. I'm not.
I'm absolutely not doing that,

28:14.867 --> 28:18.609
but I also didn't trust
leaving it in my hotel room.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.829
While James and Raquel
are off having

28:20.873 --> 28:22.613
a romantic horseback ride,
then that's where you're like,

28:22.657 --> 28:26.835
"And now we're gonna make it
about us. We're engaged!"

28:26.879 --> 28:28.750
off.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.752
And I'm not wearing it here
because I don't wanna take away

28:30.796 --> 28:32.362
from their moment.

28:32.406 --> 28:34.408
And then Scheana--"I don't
wanna make it about me."

28:34.451 --> 28:37.280
I'm like, you're literally
doing that right now.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.500
He wanted to get married here
this weekend. Okay, like--

28:39.543 --> 28:40.849
You can't get married

28:40.893 --> 28:42.459
at somebody else's
engagement party.

28:42.503 --> 28:43.591
Well, not <i>at</i> their party.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.245
We were gonna do it,
like, yesterday.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.421
- No, Scheana.
- But then...

28:47.464 --> 28:49.684
If Sandoval didn't say, like,
that feels weird,

28:49.728 --> 28:50.772
we would look over there
right now,

28:50.816 --> 28:53.732
and they would be
----ing married.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.255
So I told everyone
at the alpaca farm,

28:55.298 --> 28:56.822
but we're gonna wait

28:56.865 --> 28:58.911
and tell James and Raquel
tomorrow morning,

28:58.954 --> 29:00.390
because I'm like, I don't
wanna take anything from them--

29:00.434 --> 29:01.870
I don't think they need to know
at all this weekend.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.872
What? No, they're two
of our closest friends.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.700
I wanna tell them tomorrow,
but I didn't want--

29:05.744 --> 29:08.398
You've had a baby. You had,
like, a year to get, like...

29:08.442 --> 29:11.575
let them have their moment.
- Which is tonight.

29:11.619 --> 29:15.492
You need to sit on this
until the weekend's over.

29:15.536 --> 29:18.582
Literally hide it.
I don't care where you hide it.

29:18.626 --> 29:21.542
Stick it up your hooha
as far as I'm concerned.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.848
Do not mention this.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.763
I'm not taking from that at all.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.286
I mean, what, do I give him
the heads up?

29:26.329 --> 29:27.722
- No.
- I don't?

29:27.766 --> 29:30.333
- No. That'd be--
- You should drink more.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.858
- Give him the heads up.
- Well, I mean...

29:32.901 --> 29:35.686
is it a job for Tequila Katie?

29:42.476 --> 29:43.999
We love you.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.435
Enjoy. Enjoy the party.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.133
And thank you for inviting us
and our friends,

29:47.176 --> 29:48.308
and we love you, too.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.093
- Aw, thank you.
- Okay.

29:51.137 --> 29:51.964
Mwah.

29:52.007 --> 29:52.921
Whoo!

29:54.967 --> 29:58.274
Ooh, it's a crepe station.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.189
All right, guys, I'm gonna
switch some tunes on,

30:00.233 --> 30:02.844
and we're gonna party
by the dance floor!

30:02.888 --> 30:06.108
- Whoo!
- Can I have a glass of white?

30:06.152 --> 30:08.937
Lisa, do you know what
this reminds me of

30:08.981 --> 30:10.417
with the, uh, wax on top?

30:10.460 --> 30:13.072
- What?
- The Villa Blanca wine.

30:13.115 --> 30:16.553
I know. It was a long time ago.

30:16.597 --> 30:17.946
So it's good news about
the girls, don't you think?

30:17.990 --> 30:19.861
No, I'm really excited.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.341
I'm also really excited because

30:21.384 --> 30:24.213
I was able to raise money
for our bar, but also--

30:24.257 --> 30:25.258
- I know.
- Yeah, and then I--

30:25.301 --> 30:27.608
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.479
I just want it to get started,
Tom.

30:29.523 --> 30:33.309
Whatever's holding you up
is just such a pain in the ass.

30:33.353 --> 30:39.054
Yeah, we're waiting for permits
to clear so we can break ground.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.013
This has been going on
for months.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.666
- I know, but, Lisa--
- And I went to see the place.

30:42.710 --> 30:46.018
I thought the front of it
was a little low-key.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.368
I would rather see curb appeal.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.939
Like, can you back
the off?

30:53.982 --> 30:56.202
It's been five months of--

30:56.245 --> 30:57.986
- Lisa.
- I don't understand the delay.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.683
Tell me so that
I can understand it.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.468
You're adding a little bit
of stress.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.122
Like, I feel stressed out
sometimes

31:03.165 --> 31:04.906
when I talk to you about this.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.516
You ask my advice.
I'm giving it to you.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.911
I know. It just feels like
you've been very supportive

31:09.955 --> 31:11.521
when it comes to the girls,

31:11.565 --> 31:14.350
but with us,
it feels more critical, like...

31:14.394 --> 31:18.050
Because the girls actually
started, and they literally,

31:18.093 --> 31:20.095
I feel like
they're moving forward.

31:20.139 --> 31:22.358
Lisa, that's insulting to me,
though.

31:22.402 --> 31:24.012
Sometimes I feel like
it's really hard for Lisa

31:24.056 --> 31:27.276
to just believe that, like,
Schwartz and I are not idiots

31:27.320 --> 31:30.018
and that we actually do
bust our ass and work hard

31:30.062 --> 31:31.715
and take things
very seriously.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.152
Darling, I am telling you

31:33.195 --> 31:35.371
there's something that's holding
this project up

31:35.415 --> 31:36.677
that I don't understand.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.940
Sometimes I wish Lisa
could look past, like,

31:38.984 --> 31:42.204
who Schwartz and I used to be
eight years ago...

31:42.248 --> 31:43.989
- Nice ass.
- Thanks.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.555
- Sagittarius?
- Libra.

31:45.599 --> 31:48.341
...and see, like,
who we've become today.

31:48.384 --> 31:50.256
It's sorted. It's great.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.953
- It's all done?
- Yes!

31:51.997 --> 31:55.043
I want to see them soar.
I want to see them successful.

31:55.087 --> 31:58.960
I said that from the first
minute I heard about the bar.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.354
I feel like low-key
Lisa's looking forward

32:01.397 --> 32:05.271
to eating her words when she
sees the new place open.

32:05.314 --> 32:07.490
Well, that's good then. What are
we ----ing arguing about?

32:07.534 --> 32:10.450
- I'm just saying. I'm, like--
- Okay, then--

32:10.493 --> 32:11.668
You're like, why--
What--you're like, why--why--

32:11.712 --> 32:13.670
Because I think of you
like my children,

32:13.714 --> 32:15.324
and I'm gonna talk to you
like my children.

32:15.368 --> 32:16.630
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.110
- And it comes from love.
- Okay.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.416
- Got it?
- Yes, and I love you.

32:20.460 --> 32:23.115
Come here.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.595
It's so nice. It's beautiful.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.554
I wanna get invited
to the wedding.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.643
Scheana, will you be
one of my bridesmaids?

32:29.686 --> 32:31.775
- Wait, seriously?!
- Yeah!

32:31.819 --> 32:34.256
- Of course! Of course!

32:34.300 --> 32:36.780
This is not sitting right
with me.

32:36.824 --> 32:40.132
Brock and Scheana have not only
announced their engagement,

32:40.175 --> 32:41.698
but they also were planning
on getting married here.

32:41.742 --> 32:44.136
I need to leave. Sorry.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.138
Can I fish that $100 back yet
or what?

32:46.181 --> 32:49.184
Before there was Lala
and Scheana or Lala and Katie,

32:49.228 --> 32:53.232
it was James and Lala,
and I have his ----ing back.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.537
- Hi, James.
- Hey, what's up?

32:54.581 --> 32:58.237
- Come here for a sec.
- Oh.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.368
I'm, like, kind of shaking
right now.

32:59.412 --> 33:02.197
- Why? Why?
- Well, because, I just--I...

33:02.241 --> 33:04.286
While you guy were
horseback riding,

33:04.330 --> 33:06.462
we're at the alpaca farm.
- Yeah.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.987
Brock and Scheana announced
that they're engaged...

33:10.336 --> 33:11.424
...and that they were planning
to get married,

33:11.467 --> 33:13.643
like, during this weekend.

33:13.687 --> 33:18.083
Whatever! But oh, my God! Yes!

33:19.562 --> 33:21.521
Stay right there.

33:21.564 --> 33:23.566
Brock.

33:25.525 --> 33:28.832
So...judging from what
Lala's told me,

33:28.876 --> 33:32.140
you know, she basically thinks
you were just gonna go ahead

33:32.184 --> 33:35.230
and get married here
at the venue?

33:35.274 --> 33:37.319
Here we ----ing go.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.453
Miss Lala Kent just
----ing it up for everybody.

33:40.496 --> 33:41.889
It was here.
The location was here.

33:41.932 --> 33:44.239
- Right. And when were you--
- And then when I spoke

33:44.283 --> 33:46.459
to Scheana about it,
she shut it down.

33:46.502 --> 33:47.677
So you were just
gonna get married

33:47.721 --> 33:49.114
where I'm having
my engagement party

33:49.157 --> 33:51.246
without me being--
dude, so much wrong with it.

33:51.290 --> 33:54.423
So disrespectful. You know,
you should, like, work on

33:54.467 --> 33:56.686
knowing your place
a little bit more.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.427
Bro, what do you mean,
know my place?

33:58.471 --> 34:01.517
I've spent thousands of dollars
on this place here. Thousands.

34:01.561 --> 34:02.692
You haven't put
a ----ing penny in, bro.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.172
Yeah, the summer is not all

34:04.216 --> 34:06.218
about James and Raquel
getting married.

34:06.261 --> 34:07.349
- But the weekend is.
- But this is my weekend here.

34:07.393 --> 34:10.091
This is my weekend, man.
My weekend.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.527
Look, bro, it didn't happen
like that, so...

34:11.571 --> 34:13.616
No. How did it happen then?
Please explain to me.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.227
- It happened exactly like that.
- Right.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.706
But it didn't ----ing happen,
bro. Scheana is here with--

34:16.750 --> 34:18.360
Are you yelling at me now
at my party?

34:18.404 --> 34:21.276
Because Scheana is here
with an engagement ring from me

34:21.320 --> 34:22.669
and hasn't worn it
this whole ----ing place

34:22.712 --> 34:23.887
out of respect
for you and Raquel, okay?

34:23.931 --> 34:25.628
Good, good,
'cause then when I hear

34:25.672 --> 34:26.934
that you were announcing it--
- But don't--don't say that

34:26.977 --> 34:28.544
as if it's a favor, like,
"I did you a favor."

34:28.588 --> 34:30.720
- No, I was the asshole, dude.
- You're yelling at me again.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.113
- I was the asshole.
- Okay, I'm not gonna deal

34:32.157 --> 34:34.898
with you yelling at me.
- Bro, don't do that, bro.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.248
Listen, this is
the David versus Goliath.

34:36.291 --> 34:38.728
It's not gonna end well
for you, bro,

34:38.772 --> 34:41.122
'cause I'm ----ing David,
and I win.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.255
Well, no,
I'll be Goliath, right?

34:43.298 --> 34:44.778
That was a dumb analogy.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.214
- Where you going, bro?
- I don't wanna talk to you

34:46.258 --> 34:47.781
'cause you're yelling at me
at my party.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.478
I've got my ----ing family here.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.219
I don't need this from you.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.178
You're rude. You're obnoxious,
and you don't give a

34:53.221 --> 34:56.224
about anyone but yourself.
I'm embarrassed for you.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.403
- What's going on?
- You know what's disrespectful?

35:01.447 --> 35:02.752
Him trying to get married
to Scheana

35:02.796 --> 35:05.625
during my ----ing weekend.

35:05.668 --> 35:07.670
Ugh! Yeah. Well...

35:07.714 --> 35:11.283
Say, "Yes, it was disrespectful
and yes, it's rude as [bleep]."

35:11.326 --> 35:15.417
- Say it, Tom.
- Yeah, okay, but I will say--

35:15.461 --> 35:16.723
- Oh, what?
- Tom, you're gonna sit here

35:16.766 --> 35:18.420
and defend them being like,
"We're engaged!"

35:18.464 --> 35:19.726
Stop ----ing standing up
for everything Brock does

35:19.769 --> 35:21.162
every five ----ing minutes.
- We're here for--

35:21.206 --> 35:22.598
- Did they get engaged?
- I don't.

35:22.642 --> 35:24.296
Yes!

35:24.339 --> 35:25.558
It's just typical Lala,
shoot first

35:25.601 --> 35:27.168
and ask questions later.

35:27.212 --> 35:30.171
Just spin the whole situation.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.478
Did I say anything in front
of them? No. What did I say?

35:32.521 --> 35:34.654
No, instead you took--Instead
you took their party--

35:34.697 --> 35:36.525
What did I say?
What did I say?!

35:36.569 --> 35:37.744
- Calm down.
- Let me--No!

35:37.787 --> 35:39.398
You ----ing calm down.

35:39.441 --> 35:40.877
Get your finger out of my face,
bitch.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.314
- What did I say?
- Don't ----ing do that.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.924
Oh, because you don't do that.
Because you don't--

35:43.967 --> 35:45.621
Lala, this is a conversation
that you decided to get into,

35:45.665 --> 35:47.319
and you decided to get--
- This is one of

35:47.362 --> 35:48.581
my best ----ing friends
in the entire world.

35:48.624 --> 35:49.886
Yeah, no ----ing sh--, dude.
Mine, too.

35:49.930 --> 35:50.974
- Lower your voice.
- So I'm nothing to you now?

35:51.018 --> 35:53.238
Lower yours and go sit down.

35:53.281 --> 35:56.719
All summer Lala has used
the excuse that she's just

35:56.763 --> 35:58.895
looking out for Scheana's
best interests, but to me,

35:58.939 --> 36:02.595
it just looks like she doesn't
wanna see Scheana happy.

36:02.638 --> 36:05.206
No, we're supposed to act like
he didn't propose to me?

36:05.250 --> 36:06.903
No, you decide to announce
to everybody in that moment.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.471
- So should I--
- It was tacky as

36:09.515 --> 36:12.387
- Wow, okay, you.
- Enough.

36:12.431 --> 36:13.867
- Cool.
- Are you okay?

36:13.910 --> 36:17.740
- Baby, what happened?
- I just told James what went on.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.229
off, Lala.
- What happened?

36:28.273 --> 36:31.319
I just told James what went on,
and don't tell me

36:31.363 --> 36:33.234
that I wasn't supposed
to do that,

36:33.278 --> 36:35.323
because James is my boy,
and it's gross.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.804
James is also <i>my</i> boy.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.849
You don't have to act like that
about it.

36:39.893 --> 36:40.981
Brock and Scheana just decide,
like...

36:41.024 --> 36:42.504
- Okay.
-..."We've taken the group

36:42.548 --> 36:44.767
of people that they invited
to their engagement party,

36:44.811 --> 36:46.421
and we're gonna use it
as our platform

36:46.465 --> 36:48.031
to announce that we're
engaged, too." It's such a--

36:48.075 --> 36:51.209
Lala, you're putting a really
bizarre spin on all of that.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.427
It's not a spin. It's facts.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.777
It's not really. Not really.
Mm, kind of.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.475
- Mm, not really. Not really.
- Well...

36:56.518 --> 36:58.868
Oh, don't do this.
It gives me chills for you.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.392
- Want you to crawl--
- Then bye-bye!

37:00.435 --> 37:01.741
Oh, you're doing it again.
Go crawl in your hole, troll.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.003
- Please, I'm begging you.
- Oh, I'm such a troll.

37:03.046 --> 37:04.178
Mortifying when you get--

37:04.222 --> 37:06.267
I'm such
an ugly, disgusting troll.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.051
- Yeah, facts.
- Spin!

37:08.095 --> 37:11.229
There was really no need at all
for Lala to tell James

37:11.272 --> 37:12.752
right in the middle of the party

37:12.795 --> 37:15.058
about Scheana and Brock
being engaged.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.496
Like, obviously, you're not
doing this for your boy

37:17.539 --> 37:20.150
because you just ruined
his entire ----ing party.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.761
- You're so cool.
- I know.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.153
- Oh, my God, wow.
- I know.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.372
I'll teach you how
to be cool later, bitch.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.766
Oh, babe, I was born
----ing cool.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.029
Everybody ----ing knows it.

37:29.072 --> 37:30.465
- You guys are engaged?
- Yes.

37:30.509 --> 37:31.901
I had no--Like, I didn't know
that this happened.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.903
Because we were keeping it
secret out of respect for you.

37:33.947 --> 37:35.514
Because of this weekend,
but it's not that.

37:35.557 --> 37:36.906
- But why wouldn't you tell me?
- I don't want--

37:36.950 --> 37:38.256
Like you're one
of my best friends.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.387
Because we wanted to tell you
tomorrow morning

37:39.431 --> 37:40.910
after your engagement party.
- Yeah.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.782
We asked no one to say anything.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.828
- We are your true friends.
- You really are. I know that.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.787
- What the [bleep]?
- Because I was tunnel vision.

37:47.830 --> 37:49.571
We should have been the ones
that you

37:49.615 --> 37:51.921
were, like, confiding in.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.140
- The venue was double-booked.

37:53.183 --> 37:55.447
- But you have to see it--
- Charli, you stop.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.144
- Hey, no, don't yell at me.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.537
- Stop. Stop.
- I support--I support you guys,

37:58.580 --> 38:00.321
but I'm just saying it's not
the time and place,

38:00.365 --> 38:01.801
and that's what we're all
trying to say.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.019
That's why I did it.
You could've handled it better.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.064
Stop! Stop talking!

38:04.107 --> 38:05.413
Oh, I could've handled it
better?

38:05.457 --> 38:07.067
- Okay. Take a breather.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.286
Stop doing that.
Let's all take a breath.

38:08.329 --> 38:09.591
Please, please.
- Okay, speak.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.245
- I want you to speak
- Well, he's the one that's

38:11.289 --> 38:12.420
telling me I should handle it
better at my engagement party.

38:12.464 --> 38:13.900
- Just stop. Stop.
- He should have a little

38:13.943 --> 38:15.902
creativity in his mind.
- I should have.

38:15.945 --> 38:18.339
He proposed.
Yes, ----ing awesome.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.123
I'm so happy,
but I have not worn my ring.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.996
I have not done anything because
I didn't wanna take

38:23.039 --> 38:25.346
anything from you,
and I would not get married

38:25.390 --> 38:28.436
or do anything of the sort
without you there.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.916
I don't even ----ing care.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.484
Just the fact that she would
consider getting married

38:32.527 --> 38:35.269
on our Santa Ynez
engagement trip

38:35.313 --> 38:37.924
is disrespectful in itself.

38:37.967 --> 38:40.883
But then to tell everyone
about their engagement

38:40.927 --> 38:43.886
and not include us?

38:43.930 --> 38:45.366
Who does that?

38:45.410 --> 38:46.976
- We're gonna tell them--
- Do you understand that it sucks

38:47.020 --> 38:48.456
to be the last to know?

38:48.500 --> 38:50.197
Save the best for last.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.981
No!

38:52.025 --> 38:54.157
Yeah, I don't want all
my friends chatting with Brock,

38:54.201 --> 38:55.550
so stop talking to him.

38:55.594 --> 38:59.337
You know what? I don't blame him
for that, really.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.164
- Come here, come here.
- You're 2 for 2, bro.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.340
- You okay?
- Yeah, there--there's--

39:02.383 --> 39:04.167
Come here.

39:04.211 --> 39:07.388
The way it was revealed was
a bit of, like, being, like,

39:07.432 --> 39:09.347
"But don't tell anyone
'cause we wanna tell them."

39:09.390 --> 39:10.652
They wanted to have
a private moment.

39:10.696 --> 39:13.176
I know, but they didn't have
a private moment.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.874
This is my night, darling.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.919
I've spent thousands of dollars
on this venue.

39:16.963 --> 39:18.660
No one's trying to take away
from your venue or your party.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.183
And no one will.
And no one will.

39:20.227 --> 39:21.489
I'm done talking to you, Ariana.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.404
This is my week, people.

39:23.448 --> 39:26.015
I've spent ----ing thousands
of dollars on this entire thing.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.496
My family has been flown out,
and so has Raquel's.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.411
I've got Grandma Buttons here.

39:30.455 --> 39:34.154
You should all have some grace
and celebrate their engagement

39:34.197 --> 39:36.374
and leave this bullsh--
for another day.

39:36.417 --> 39:40.203
How embarrassing for this man.
Can you even call this a man?

39:40.247 --> 39:42.118
Like, look at me.
I'm ----ing James Kennedy.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.643
I'm a ----ing gentleman. I do
things by the ----ing "T."

39:44.686 --> 39:47.297
I ----ing got Coachella when
there was no Coachella.

39:47.341 --> 39:50.388
I got my ----ing family
out here, and this is my event!

39:50.431 --> 39:51.911
I hope you guys are having fun
chumming it up, and, yeah,

39:51.954 --> 39:53.129
he's got a heart of gold
and blah, blah, ----ing blah.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.174
- No, no, James, James--
- No, let me talk,

39:54.217 --> 39:57.046
'cause I came over here, okay?

39:57.090 --> 39:58.265
I don't even want you here
anymore, bro.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.397
- He was owning up to that.
- Please leave.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.441
Go back home
to your baby, honestly.

40:00.485 --> 40:01.573
I don't even want you here
anymore.

40:01.616 --> 40:02.922
James, he was owning up to that.
He was--

40:02.965 --> 40:03.879
No, no, no, no, no.
On that one, you're right.

40:03.923 --> 40:04.793
Thank you, mate. See you later.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.447
James, he was owning up to that.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.406
I don't want him here anymore.
He's ruining our ----ing day.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.408
He's ----ing annoying.
Get the out of my party.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.670
- Me?
- No, not you. Brock.

40:11.713 --> 40:14.020
Okay.

40:14.063 --> 40:17.153
Honey. Honey!

40:17.197 --> 40:19.025
- I was waiting for ya.
- Hi.

40:19.068 --> 40:20.374
Let's get outta here.
I wanna go.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.072
- Leave?
- Yeah. James told me--

40:23.116 --> 40:25.640
James doesn't want me here,
so we gotta go.

40:25.684 --> 40:29.035
What did he say exactly?

40:29.078 --> 40:31.080
He said get the...
the eff out of my party.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.169
But am I kicked out, too?

40:33.213 --> 40:34.562
No, you can stay.
It's not your--

40:34.606 --> 40:36.521
Like, if you want to stay,
I would like you to stay.

40:36.564 --> 40:39.437
it.
Put your ring on and stay.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.395
Uh, I feel...

40:41.439 --> 40:42.570
I mean, you had it here
all weekend.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.442
The cat's out of the bag.

40:44.485 --> 40:47.445
There you are, honey.
I love you.

40:47.488 --> 40:50.578
- I love you, too.
- Bye.

40:50.622 --> 40:53.538
These guys are hard
to deal with,

40:53.581 --> 40:57.367
and now I have to do <i>more</i>
for their approval,

40:57.411 --> 40:59.500
but their approval,
to be honest.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.067
Like, if they don't like me,
[bleep], they don't like me.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.547
I don't care.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.374
He lost a friend tonight.

41:04.418 --> 41:06.507
My respect for Brock has gone
out the freaking window.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.161
Do you think I would ever
bring you to a farm

41:08.204 --> 41:10.729
to announce our proposal?
It's cheap and it's nasty.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.557
Hello, Lisa.

41:14.341 --> 41:16.691
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.345
I wasn't expecting that.

41:18.388 --> 41:22.523
You know, the day...
it's not going as expected.

41:22.567 --> 41:25.134
- I'm sorry.
- I mean, honestly,

41:25.178 --> 41:26.614
you guys are in so deep,

41:26.658 --> 41:27.789
you're getting married
regardless

41:27.833 --> 41:29.487
because you love each
other so much.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.227
Now tonight I'm watching you,
and I'm thinking, oh, my God.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.534
What's James gonna do?
This is his party.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.101
They're all screaming.

41:35.144 --> 41:36.537
You held it together,
and you were reasonable.

41:36.581 --> 41:39.148
That's what you've gotta do
in your relationship.

41:39.192 --> 41:43.501
This is probably the only time
I can support James Kennedy

41:43.544 --> 41:45.328
being pissed off
and reactionary.

41:45.372 --> 41:49.550
I think maybe even I would have
reacted the same way.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.813
Well, it doesn't mean
that I'm gonna be having

41:51.857 --> 41:55.469
a nice sit-down, make-up
by the fire later, 'cause no.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.644
- Yeah, be with me.
- Be with the bride.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.211
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna be with me?

41:58.254 --> 42:00.256
- I'd love to be. I would love--
- I'd love to be with you.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.171
I would love nothing more
than that.

42:02.215 --> 42:04.043
That's all that matters.

42:04.086 --> 42:07.437
In the past, this would have
ruined my entire ----ing night,

42:07.481 --> 42:08.743
and these people come for me,

42:08.787 --> 42:10.658
these ----ing snakes
in the grass.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.486
They've always gotten the best
out of James Kennedy.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.792
They've always, always, always
gotten the best,

42:13.835 --> 42:15.576
but not tonight.

42:15.620 --> 42:19.145
- You can make it work.
- Thank you. Thank you, Lisa.

42:19.188 --> 42:20.799
I'm not gonna let this ruin
the night.

42:20.842 --> 42:22.583
I'm gonna change the vibe,
flip the script,

42:22.627 --> 42:24.454
as I like to say, and let's
just keep it positive.

42:24.498 --> 42:26.674
You know, the show must go on.

42:28.458 --> 42:31.592
Give it up
for my beautiful fiancée!

42:35.640 --> 42:37.380
Hey!

42:37.424 --> 42:40.340
I feel like I know better
than anyone

42:40.383 --> 42:41.820
what it takes to, like,
be a part of this group

42:41.863 --> 42:44.431
and improve yourself,
and you know,

42:44.474 --> 42:46.389
some are meant
to be friends forever.

42:46.433 --> 42:48.087
Some are not.

42:48.130 --> 42:50.480
We're dysfunctional as

42:50.524 --> 42:52.395
And if you wanna get down
with us,

42:52.439 --> 42:54.528
you just wanna get in
where you fit in.
