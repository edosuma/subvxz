You do solemnly swear

25:37.510 --> 25:39.144
that the testimony you are about to give

25:39.178 --> 25:40.745
in the matter now pending before this court

25:40.780 --> 25:42.113
shall be the truth, the whole truth,

25:42.148 --> 25:44.115
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

25:44.150 --> 25:45.550
Yes, ma'am.

25:45.584 --> 25:48.019
Please take the stand and be seated.

25:50.956 --> 25:52.924
State your full name

25:52.958 --> 25:54.926
and spell your last name
for the record, please.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.128
Hector Tontz.

25:57.163 --> 26:02.000
T-o-n-t-z.

26:02.034 --> 26:06.504
Rick: Mr. Tontz, on
September 15th of last year

26:06.539 --> 26:09.741
at 11:45 in the evening,
were you in the location

26:09.775 --> 26:13.945
of 5608 Lombard Avenue in Modesto?

26:13.979 --> 26:15.947
Yes.

26:15.981 --> 26:17.348
I was cruising around that night

26:17.383 --> 26:21.853
and... I got a text from Carter Nix.

26:21.887 --> 26:25.323
And what did that text say?

26:25.357 --> 26:27.559
[Heart beating]

26:37.987 --> 26:39.760
[Buzzer]

26:39.760 --> 26:41.425
[Door opens]

26:45.341 --> 26:47.215
[Door closes]

27:10.600 --> 27:11.967
Ms. Taylor.

27:12.001 --> 27:13.168
Who are you?

27:13.202 --> 27:16.338
Tim Little, Carter's attorney.

27:16.372 --> 27:18.340
How is he?

27:18.374 --> 27:22.177
He does all right.

27:22.211 --> 27:26.348
Uh, w-w-what happened at that hearing thing?

27:26.382 --> 27:29.584
He asked me to handdeliver this to you.

27:29.619 --> 27:32.721
[Paper slides]

27:45.034 --> 27:47.836
- What is this bull...
- I'm sorry.

27:47.870 --> 27:50.639
I want to see him. No,
I-I want to see Carter.

27:50.673 --> 27:51.840
- Stop.
- He would never do this!

27:51.874 --> 27:52.741
- Hands off!
- He... he promised!

27:52.775 --> 27:54.342
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Please! Please!

27:54.377 --> 27:55.543
You made him do this.

27:55.578 --> 27:57.278
- Calm down.
- No, you can't!

27:57.313 --> 28:00.015
[Door opens] Get off me! Aah!

28:00.049 --> 28:03.184
[Grunts] Calm down! Hey, just relax!

28:03.219 --> 28:05.987
[Breathing heavily] Carter.

28:12.695 --> 28:15.063
[Insects chirping]

28:15.097 --> 28:16.331
Russ: F-forgive the mess.

28:16.365 --> 28:18.166
Mm-hmm.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.735
[Breathes deeply]

28:20.770 --> 28:22.737
It's really coming along.

28:22.772 --> 28:25.173
Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm getting there.

28:25.207 --> 28:27.375
Um... is there...

28:27.410 --> 28:30.178
I-is there any indication
at all from the judge?

28:30.212 --> 28:32.180
No, she meant what she said.

28:32.214 --> 28:34.549
- She's gonna take her time with it.
- Mm.

28:34.583 --> 28:38.553
[Sighs]

28:38.587 --> 28:41.356
What?

28:41.390 --> 28:43.992
Did you know Barb bought a gun?

28:44.026 --> 28:45.994
A gun? No.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.996
Really?

28:48.030 --> 28:48.797
[Stammers]

28:48.831 --> 28:50.198
If there's one person in the world

28:50.232 --> 28:51.766
who should not have a gun, it's Barb.

28:51.801 --> 28:54.569
When this all plays out,
Carter could be released.

28:54.603 --> 28:56.671
- Oh, I doubt, uh, that.
- It's possible.

28:56.706 --> 29:00.241
Barb, she's... she's an intense person,

29:00.276 --> 29:03.278
but Barb... I mean, she'd
never shoot anybody.

29:03.312 --> 29:05.680
- No, no, no.
- I mean, she just - she wouldn't.

29:05.715 --> 29:10.085
I'm not worried about her
shooting someone else.

29:10.119 --> 29:12.253
Well...

29:12.288 --> 29:14.255
I mean, no, obviously she's upset,

29:14.290 --> 29:17.092
but...

29:17.126 --> 29:20.295
She's... I mean, she's not like that.

29:20.329 --> 29:24.065
Well, I never thought I
was like that, either.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.467
When the man who killed my daughter

29:25.501 --> 29:26.434
got that joke of a sentence,

29:26.469 --> 29:29.437
I bought a gun, taught myself how to use it.

29:29.472 --> 29:31.272
To kill?

29:33.309 --> 29:35.276
I picked out a spot where my husband

29:35.311 --> 29:37.479
wouldn't be the first person to find me,

29:37.513 --> 29:40.081
somewhere outside where
I wouldn't make a mess.

29:40.116 --> 29:42.450
Had music on my iPod.

29:42.485 --> 29:46.421
I really, uh... I-I set it up good.

29:46.455 --> 29:48.823
I can't see you as that kind of person.

29:48.858 --> 29:50.425
What's the type?

29:50.459 --> 29:52.460
What's the type, except you can't stand

29:52.495 --> 29:54.462
what you're going through anymore?

29:54.497 --> 29:57.265
You know, it w... it was so easy

29:57.299 --> 29:59.434
to put that gun up to my chin,

29:59.468 --> 30:02.270
easy right up to pulling the trigger.

30:02.304 --> 30:03.438
But you have to be strong to do that.

30:03.472 --> 30:06.207
I wasn't. Barb is.

30:08.511 --> 30:13.114
Have you, um...

30:13.149 --> 30:15.316
H-have you talked to Barb about this?

30:15.351 --> 30:16.918
No.

30:16.952 --> 30:19.521
Uh, you should.

30:19.555 --> 30:21.756
I don't think it's my place.

30:26.162 --> 30:27.562
Our, um...

30:30.366 --> 30:33.768
Our lives weren't always this bad.

30:36.172 --> 30:39.941
S-s-she should remember that.

30:39.976 --> 30:41.977
Then maybe you should remind her.

30:44.513 --> 30:46.681
You're doing a good thing here.

30:46.716 --> 30:48.883
Hmm.

30:53.189 --> 30:56.358
Aubry: Just get Carter's lawyer.

30:56.392 --> 30:58.259
- Ruth: No.
- I just need a few minutes with him.

30:58.294 --> 31:00.261
- I won't do it.
- Where's dad?

31:00.296 --> 31:01.830
Oh, "dad." When you need him, it's "dad."

31:01.864 --> 31:03.264
- And when you don't...
- Please.

31:03.299 --> 31:06.267
I need Carter to tell me
why he tore the picture.

31:06.302 --> 31:08.637
- Why do you think?
- I need him to tell me why.

31:08.671 --> 31:11.840
He's done with you.

31:11.874 --> 31:16.044
I'll never ask you for anything ever again.

31:16.078 --> 31:18.046
- I swear to God.
- It's not healthy.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.916
- Please.
- I believe that, you father, Carter's sister...

31:26.389 --> 31:28.590
You talked to Aliyah?

31:32.528 --> 31:34.529
Did you talk to Carter?

31:38.100 --> 31:41.236
You talked to Carter, and he did this.

31:41.270 --> 31:44.606
It's for the best.

31:46.909 --> 31:48.877
I want to talk to my lawyer.

31:48.911 --> 31:50.879
He will not facilitate any communication

31:50.913 --> 31:52.313
between you and Carter whatsoever.

31:52.348 --> 31:54.315
I'm gonna send Carter a message.

31:56.552 --> 31:59.521
I want to see someone from the D.A.'s office

31:59.555 --> 32:02.357
and that detective.

32:02.391 --> 32:04.159
Bring them all in here.

32:12.529 --> 32:14.129
We appreciate you wanting to work with us.

32:14.197 --> 32:15.331
But based on your prior exhibitions,

32:15.398 --> 32:16.932
we would like to get
directly to your testimony.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.201
If the things you tell us have value,

32:19.269 --> 32:21.971
then we'd still be open to a plea agreement.

32:26.142 --> 32:28.777
This is the gun used to kill Matt Skokie.

32:28.845 --> 32:30.679
Hector Tontz testified

32:30.747 --> 32:33.015
that Carter Nix had it in his possession.

32:33.083 --> 32:36.785
Did Carter use this to murder Matt Skokie?

32:36.853 --> 32:38.787
That's the gun.

32:41.191 --> 32:43.192
But Carter didn't use it.

32:45.495 --> 32:46.796
I used it.

32:46.863 --> 32:49.598
I shot Matt. I shot his wife.

32:49.666 --> 32:51.067
- Ohh.
- Hold on.

32:51.134 --> 32:52.501
- Michael: What are you doing?
- I shot them.

32:52.569 --> 32:53.536
Stop it. Stop this.

32:53.603 --> 32:54.537
I need a moment alone with my client.

32:54.604 --> 32:55.504
- Ruth: She's lying.
- I'm not lying.

32:55.572 --> 32:56.739
Listen to me. Let me help you, please.

32:56.807 --> 32:57.940
She's an habitual liar.
This is what she does.

32:58.008 --> 32:58.974
Rick: No, no, no. Get
something to record this.

32:59.042 --> 33:01.344
Michael: Aubry, stop it. Aubry, please.

33:01.411 --> 33:02.745
I'm telling them what I'm telling them.

33:02.813 --> 33:05.014
- Warren: I advise you not to.
- I don't care what you advise.

33:05.082 --> 33:06.582
I'm telling them what I'm telling them.

33:06.650 --> 33:08.184
If you do this, I am done with you.

33:08.251 --> 33:09.518
- I mean it. I'm done.
- Oh, then go.

33:09.586 --> 33:11.187
My client is obviously distraught.

33:11.254 --> 33:12.388
Just give us two minutes alone to discuss...

33:12.456 --> 33:14.190
- Can I fire him?
- Ruth: You're being foolish.

33:14.257 --> 33:15.758
- Oh, you can go, too.
- Rick: He works for you.

33:15.826 --> 33:17.360
You're fired.

33:17.427 --> 33:19.962
You're done. Get out.

33:24.334 --> 33:27.436
[Sighs] Just go.

33:29.907 --> 33:33.442
Michael. [Sighs]

33:33.510 --> 33:37.780
[Inhales deeply] I'm staying.

33:39.516 --> 33:41.450
[Door closes]

33:47.257 --> 33:49.158
[Beep]

33:49.226 --> 33:50.826
[Clears throat]

33:50.894 --> 33:53.262
The statement of Aubry
Taylor is taking place

33:53.330 --> 33:55.531
at the Stanislaus County Psychiatric Center.

33:55.599 --> 33:58.067
Present are Deputy District
Attorney Soderbergh

33:58.135 --> 33:59.569
and myself, Detective Quinn.

33:59.636 --> 34:01.571
- Aubry Taylor's mother...
- Ruth.

34:01.638 --> 34:03.606
Ruth is also a witness.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.675
Ms. Taylor has previously
been advised of her rights

34:05.742 --> 34:07.977
and has waived the right
to have counsel present.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.579
Is that correct, Ms. Taylor?

34:09.646 --> 34:10.780
Yes.

34:10.847 --> 34:14.016
All right, Aubry, let's
start at the beginning.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.652
You have specific
information to share with us

34:16.719 --> 34:19.422
regarding the events of
September 15th of last year.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.623
Yes.

34:21.692 --> 34:24.060
Carter Nix went to this one dealer's house.

34:24.127 --> 34:26.128
- The dealer's name?
- Matt Skokie.

34:26.196 --> 34:27.797
Do you know his address?

34:27.864 --> 34:30.833
- Somewhere on Lombard.
- 5608 Lombard Avenue?

34:30.900 --> 34:32.101
I guess.

34:32.168 --> 34:35.438
Mm-hmm. For what reason did
Mr. Nix go to this address?

34:35.505 --> 34:36.906
Carter went to score drugs.

34:36.974 --> 34:38.574
And Hector Tontz drove him.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.409
I guess.

34:40.476 --> 34:41.643
What happened?

34:41.712 --> 34:43.980
Tried to negotiate, got hectic.

34:44.047 --> 34:45.648
Carter was short on funds,

34:45.716 --> 34:48.985
so Skokie told him he'd give
him drugs if I blew him.

34:49.052 --> 34:50.119
Carter was like... that.

34:50.187 --> 34:53.356
Stole some cash, credit cards, took off.

34:53.422 --> 34:54.556
But you weren't there?

34:54.625 --> 34:55.625
No.

34:55.692 --> 34:59.362
Hmm. What happened next?

34:59.429 --> 35:01.097
Carter comes back,

35:01.164 --> 35:06.068
tells me how Matt Skokie
was all "(Muted) this"

35:06.136 --> 35:11.474
and "(Muted) that,"
"(Muted)... your white bitch."

35:12.876 --> 35:15.211
Carter didn't do anything.

35:15.279 --> 35:18.281
He's too cool to care.

35:18.348 --> 35:20.783
He tells me what this
racist bastard's saying,

35:20.851 --> 35:23.052
so <i>I</i> went to settle.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.388
You went to 5608 Lombard Avenue?

35:25.456 --> 35:27.523
Whatever the address was,
it was Skokie's place.

35:27.591 --> 35:29.025
At what time?

35:29.093 --> 35:31.194
11:45... around there.

35:31.261 --> 35:34.030
Alone? On foot?

35:34.098 --> 35:35.598
You couldn't have made it from your place

35:35.666 --> 35:38.000
to the crime scene to fire
a shot in that time frame.

35:38.068 --> 35:39.836
Weren't at our place.

35:39.903 --> 35:42.405
We were shacking the night
with this dude, Everett.

35:42.473 --> 35:44.841
Everett's got some pieces laying around.

35:44.908 --> 35:47.643
Him, Carter are passed out.

35:47.711 --> 35:51.047
I'm like, "I'm gonna go
get some business handled."

35:51.115 --> 35:53.282
- I took the gun.
- Carter's gun.

35:53.350 --> 35:55.485
- Everett's gun.
- Rick: Where do we find Everett?

35:55.552 --> 35:57.520
Hell if I know. The guy floats.

35:57.588 --> 36:00.123
If you find him, I can I.D. him.

36:00.190 --> 36:01.891
Did you take this gun with you

36:01.959 --> 36:05.361
with the intent to shoot
either Mr. Skokie or his wife?

36:05.429 --> 36:09.332
Only for protection. That guy was violent.

36:09.399 --> 36:10.967
I wanted it if things got out of hand,

36:11.034 --> 36:12.468
which they did, big time.

36:12.536 --> 36:15.304
Keep going.

36:15.372 --> 36:18.174
I swapped sex for drugs with Matt before,

36:18.242 --> 36:20.276
so I used that to get back in.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.245
Mr. Skokie let you back into his home?

36:22.312 --> 36:23.613
Yeah.

36:23.680 --> 36:27.216
His wife wasn't putting out...
Not for him, anyway...

36:27.284 --> 36:29.085
So he was always pretty hard up.

36:29.153 --> 36:30.987
An easy play.

36:31.054 --> 36:33.789
Matt and me started
negotiating all over again.

36:33.857 --> 36:36.058
Was there sexual contact?

36:36.126 --> 36:39.829
Was there...? That the question?

36:39.897 --> 36:43.699
Yeah, he was for sure trying to get some.

36:43.767 --> 36:46.202
Then his wife came in,
screaming her head off.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.637
This was Gwen Skokie?

36:47.704 --> 36:49.839
Matt was real rough with her.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.741
Practically wrung her arm off

36:51.808 --> 36:53.910
flinging her back into the bedroom.

36:53.977 --> 36:56.412
Bruised her arms up.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.648
Mm, I hate seeing guys do women like that.

36:58.715 --> 37:00.149
I've been on the bad end of enough of that.

37:00.217 --> 37:03.186
So I tried to split.

37:03.253 --> 37:05.454
Matt wouldn't let me.

37:05.522 --> 37:07.423
He wouldn't let you leave?

37:07.491 --> 37:09.859
[Voice breaking] No.

37:09.927 --> 37:12.862
He wrung my arm, just like he did with her.

37:12.930 --> 37:16.399
When I fought back, h-he punched me,

37:16.466 --> 37:20.636
shoved me down, s-started
tearing my clothes off.

37:20.704 --> 37:22.905
[Scoffs]

37:22.973 --> 37:25.441
It was like my brother and his friends

37:25.509 --> 37:28.511
attacking me all over again.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.580
So I fought back the only way I could.

37:30.647 --> 37:33.015
Which was how?

37:33.083 --> 37:36.085
I shot him in the face.

37:36.153 --> 37:40.489
I didn't mean to do it. It was self-defense.

37:40.557 --> 37:41.857
When his wife heard the shot,

37:41.925 --> 37:43.259
she came running out of the bedroom at me

37:43.327 --> 37:45.061
with something in her hands.

37:45.128 --> 37:47.430
Do you know what that was?

37:47.497 --> 37:50.633
All I knew was it was big
and gnarly enough to kill me,

37:50.701 --> 37:53.436
so I...

37:53.503 --> 37:56.138
I shot her, too.

37:58.408 --> 38:00.276
Then I split.

38:00.344 --> 38:02.545
Took the gun, threw in in the Merced River.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.847
That's where you found it...
Somewhere around there, right?

38:04.915 --> 38:07.650
[Breathes deeply]

38:09.486 --> 38:12.388
Went to a liquor store, got a PBR.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.524
They probably got a video
of me or something.

38:15.592 --> 38:18.160
[Sighs]

38:23.934 --> 38:25.968
[Beep]

38:30.641 --> 38:32.642
[Knock on door]

38:37.047 --> 38:38.748
Hey. What?

38:38.815 --> 38:41.417
Uh, can I come in for a minute?

38:41.485 --> 38:42.752
You know where this goes.

38:42.819 --> 38:43.819
Just for a minute.

38:43.887 --> 38:46.022
I found some photos at Matt's house

38:46.089 --> 38:48.291
I want to show you.

38:48.358 --> 38:52.428
It's like looking at pictures
of somebody else's family.

38:52.496 --> 38:56.065
It wasn't all bad.

38:56.133 --> 38:58.634
No.

39:01.471 --> 39:04.440
Part of my 12-step for my gambling addiction

39:04.508 --> 39:06.609
was to admit fault for the mistakes I made.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.378
- Okay.
- Can you ever accept that?

39:09.446 --> 39:11.013
I can't even understand it.

39:11.081 --> 39:14.717
You're the one that started me gambling.

39:14.785 --> 39:17.420
F-first time I ever gambled with you...

39:17.487 --> 39:21.424
Quarters at video poker at
the California Hotel in Vegas.

39:21.491 --> 39:22.525
Yes.

39:22.592 --> 39:24.960
And from that dollar, I got you addicted.

39:25.028 --> 39:29.498
No. Well, I-I was sitting
there with you all night.

39:29.566 --> 39:32.968
You could take $20 and turn it
into eight hours of gambling.

39:33.036 --> 39:34.537
It was just meant to be fun.

39:34.604 --> 39:36.072
It's always fun when you're winning.

39:36.139 --> 39:38.474
You never understood
how to play the machines.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.642
You'd get these random draws,

39:39.710 --> 39:42.044
and you'd always hold the kicker.

39:42.112 --> 39:43.979
You can't play a double-double bonus

39:44.047 --> 39:46.215
like it was a deuces wild.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.751
That's the Barb I love.

39:48.819 --> 39:51.954
Video poker and an all-night buffet...

39:52.022 --> 39:53.756
That's all she needed.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.261
Oh, we could have had fun.

40:01.765 --> 40:03.532
But you got greedy with your gambling.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.334
- Not greedy.
- Yeah, you were greedy.

40:05.402 --> 40:06.702
You wanted to win all the time.

40:06.770 --> 40:08.804
That's not how gambling addiction works.

40:08.872 --> 40:10.539
It's not about the money.

40:10.607 --> 40:14.076
You lost enough of it. You stole enough.

40:14.144 --> 40:16.479
You know, I'm at the tables...
Forget video poker.

40:16.546 --> 40:18.314
I'm at the tables and the
dealer's got an ace showing.

40:18.382 --> 40:20.816
You're supposed to play like
he's got a face in the hole.

40:20.884 --> 40:22.618
I just know I can bust him

40:22.686 --> 40:25.254
or watch him turn a 7, then draw a 3

40:25.322 --> 40:26.822
on the crap pair of 8s I'm holding

40:26.890 --> 40:28.257
and collect.

40:28.325 --> 40:32.027
I'm sitting there, money on the felt,

40:32.095 --> 40:34.296
and I know I can do it...
Same with roulette.

40:34.364 --> 40:35.965
Every other sucker's placing wide,

40:36.032 --> 40:38.033
I lay the action numbers.

40:38.101 --> 40:41.737
And I can make the ball land winner.

40:41.805 --> 40:43.272
<i>Make</i> it land.

40:43.340 --> 40:44.707
Now they're sliding over my chips.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.842
Don't matter if it's $10 or $10 million.

40:46.910 --> 40:49.645
I did that.

40:49.713 --> 40:52.748
The universe, the odds,

40:52.816 --> 40:56.051
everything that said it couldn't happen...

40:56.119 --> 40:58.254
<i>I</i> made it happen.

40:58.321 --> 41:00.256
- Control.
- Mm.

41:00.323 --> 41:03.259
No, good Russ Skokie has all
the power in the universe

41:03.326 --> 41:07.263
to make the ball drop black 13.

41:07.330 --> 41:09.532
And I felt that way before I got sober.

41:09.599 --> 41:12.735
You can't control the universe.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.671
You can't even control what's going on here.

41:20.110 --> 41:22.778
Matt needed you, and you weren't here.

41:29.319 --> 41:32.822
And I have to live with that.

41:32.889 --> 41:35.758
We all have to live with
the things we've done.

41:35.826 --> 41:38.427
We got to live, Barb.

41:45.235 --> 41:49.071
I'm grateful for all you
did for Matt and Mark.

41:49.139 --> 41:50.506
I know it wasn't easy...

41:50.574 --> 41:53.509
All the tough choices you had to make.

41:55.912 --> 41:59.215
But whatever good things the boys had,

41:59.283 --> 42:01.784
they had because of you.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.889
Remember that.

42:14.598 --> 42:15.531
