WEBVTT

00:08.634 --> 00:12.930
Thank you very much.
Well, Roz... Oh, baby pictures?

00:13.097 --> 00:14.807
Actually, these aren't
the most flattering.

00:14.974 --> 00:18.602
Oh, nonsense, Baby Alice
couldn't possibly take a bad picture.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.312
Oh, well, that's just adorable,

00:20.521 --> 00:23.399
the silly little one with the jam
all over her face.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.819
Well, actually, that's not jam, Frasier,
it's baby eczema.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.864
Oh, well, there's no need
to worry about that.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.741
That sort of thing
is bound to clear up.

00:33.075 --> 00:36.579
- Or spread.
- Just give them back.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.788
Oh, hello, all.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.499
- Oh, Niles.
- Baby pictures.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.418
I don't really want anyone
to look at those.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.378
Well, I don't know why not.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.423
Botticelli himself couldn't have painted
a more perfect angel.

00:47.631 --> 00:50.968
Well, thank you, Niles.
She is precious, isn't she?

00:52.428 --> 00:53.762
<i>I know.</i>

00:53.971 --> 00:56.473
Anyway, Niles, how did things go
with Maris' lawyers?

00:56.682 --> 00:58.225
Cappuccino, please.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.519
Maris is determined
to prolong my suffering.

01:00.686 --> 01:04.147
She's asked to postpone our court date
another eight months.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.858
- Eight months?
- Yes.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.069
Last night, I was in such a state,
I wished I had a piano to crawl under.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.029
What?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.907
It's a habit I developed as a child
to combat anxiety.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.785
There's something about the safe,
dark, protected environment.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.412
- It seemed comforting to me.
- Yes.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.791
The week before his first Little League
tryout, he practically lived under there.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.252
Well, we all did weird stuff
when we were kids.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.672
<i>I know.</i>

01:29.381 --> 01:32.467
So, Niles, how did your lawyers
respond to this postponement request?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.845
Well, I can tell you
they weren't very happy about it.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.721
They got on the phone,
raised some hell

01:36.888 --> 01:40.725
and got that postponement cut down
to seven months.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.854
Niles, are you serious?
You think maybe it's time

01:44.020 --> 01:46.147
that you consider getting
some new lawyers?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.775
Fire Harrison and Reid?
They're the top firm in Seattle.

01:48.984 --> 01:51.695
But they're bleeding you dry.
They don't mind these postponements.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.239
The longer they draw this out,
the more money they'll get.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.700
Oh, you know, I have
the perfect person for you to call.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.953
My old boyfriend, Donny.
He's a great lawyer.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.913
No offence, Roz, but I highly doubt

02:02.080 --> 02:04.833
that your Donny is in the same league
with Harrison and Reid.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.669
Don't be so sure.
I mean, he's smart, he's tough.

02:07.836 --> 02:11.631
He doesn't take no for an answer,
not that I ever tested that theory.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.925
Wait a minute,
are we talking about Donny Douglas?

02:14.092 --> 02:15.510
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.471
Niles, I've read about this guy.
He's the one they call The Piranha.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.182
Yeah, but that's because
he has this night-grinding problem

02:21.349 --> 02:24.352
that makes his teeth really sharp
and tiny.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.898
Yes, well, anyway, Niles, I mean,
this guy just won a huge case.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.942
I mean, he might be
just who you need.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.193
I appreciate your concern,

02:32.360 --> 02:35.822
but, really, my situation is not as dire
as you're making it out to be.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.449
- What's that smell?
- What smell?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.159
The one coming out
of your briefcase.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.078
Oh, I don't smell anything.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.582
Oh, my God, is this your lunch?

02:46.749 --> 02:49.001
A bologna sandwich?

02:51.421 --> 02:55.216
And a fruit cocktail?

02:55.424 --> 03:00.012
Oh, Niles, do you see what
these lawyers have reduced you to?

03:00.179 --> 03:02.223
Do you have any idea
what they're having for lunch?

03:02.390 --> 03:05.142
I don't know. They don't itemise,
they just bill me for the total.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.778
Donny should be here any minute.
Make yourselves comfortable.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.406
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:19.323 --> 03:20.908
Frasier, you really don't have to stay.

03:21.075 --> 03:24.578
Well, I didn't have to come at all,
but if I hadn't, you never would have.

03:24.745 --> 03:26.622
Well, the office seems nice enough.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.666
Might have overdone it
on the plants a little.

03:28.833 --> 03:33.420
Yes, it's excess like this
that's destroying the plastic rain forest.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.714
Niles.

03:37.299 --> 03:39.969
University of Las Vegas.

03:42.054 --> 03:45.307
No problem finding tassels
for those mortarboards.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.271
Will you stop being such a snob?

03:51.480 --> 03:53.399
Give this man a chance,
for God's sake.

03:53.565 --> 03:55.401
And, please, will you have a mint?

03:55.567 --> 03:58.612
I'm halfway across the room,
all I can smell is bologna.

04:00.447 --> 04:02.157
Hey. How you doing?
Donny Douglas.

04:02.324 --> 04:04.701
- How are you? Who's who?
- Mr. Douglas, I'm Frasier Crane.

04:04.868 --> 04:06.161
- This is Niles.
- You're Niles.

04:06.328 --> 04:07.371
- Frasier Crane?
- Yes.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.373
- You're Roz's buddy, aren't you?
- Yes, yes.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.542
You gotta do me a favour, okay?
Tell Roz,

04:11.708 --> 04:14.628
finally, I had my teeth capped.
See? Look.

04:14.795 --> 04:17.505
- Oh, yes. Well, I'll tell her.
- You promise you won't forget?

04:17.673 --> 04:19.675
- Oh, not much danger of that.
- Okay.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.927
Now, I gotta be in court
in about 20 minutes,

04:22.094 --> 04:23.929
so sit down, let's get started.

04:24.096 --> 04:25.639
Well, as we discussed
on the phone...

04:25.806 --> 04:30.352
Maria, get me my grey suit for court.
Come on, come on, come on.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.356
Maris is determined to exhaust my
already strained financial resources.

04:34.564 --> 04:35.941
- And the real injustice...
- Yeah.

04:36.149 --> 04:38.944
And, Maria, could you just cancel
that 4:00 of mine?

04:39.111 --> 04:42.739
And would you also put Joe Silva
on my call sheet?

04:42.948 --> 04:44.491
I'm listening, I'm listening. Come on.

04:44.699 --> 04:46.535
Well, Maris has no right
to be angry with me.

04:46.701 --> 04:48.912
Maria, you're the best.
Thank you so much. Cool.

04:49.079 --> 04:51.915
What? What? Come on, let's go.
What?

04:52.082 --> 04:54.709
- I'm sorry, I forgot what I was saying.
- Oh, don't worry.

04:54.876 --> 04:56.920
Maria has that effect on men
all the time.

04:59.756 --> 05:03.760
Niles, I think you were about to tell
Mr. Douglas about Dr. Schenkman.

05:03.969 --> 05:06.388
Right. Well, last year,

05:06.554 --> 05:09.057
Maris and I were actually
making progress in couples therapy,

05:09.224 --> 05:12.602
when, to my dismay, I discovered
that she and our therapist were...

05:12.811 --> 05:14.479
- Oh, my God.
- That's right, they were...

05:14.646 --> 05:17.107
This is the best corned beef
I have ever tasted.

05:18.024 --> 05:20.318
You've gotta have a bite of this.
Here.

05:20.485 --> 05:22.946
- Come on, it's got spicy mustard.
- No, thanks.

05:23.154 --> 05:26.741
- How about you?
- Sorry, mustard allergy.

05:28.535 --> 05:31.412
Mr. Douglas, maybe we'll come back
when you have more time.

05:31.579 --> 05:35.250
No, no, no. I got the gist.
Your wife was doing your shrink.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.919
Now she's trying to bleed you
with a long pre-trial, I get it.

05:38.086 --> 05:39.963
- Who's her lawyer?
- Lockhart and Whalen.

05:40.129 --> 05:44.759
- Maria, get me Lockhart. Or Whalen.
- Wait, wait, wait, you're calling them?

05:44.926 --> 05:47.929
Yeah, listen, could we just
cut through the formalities here?

05:48.429 --> 05:49.472
Okay.

05:49.639 --> 05:52.517
Niles, what you need
is a guy like me representing you.

05:52.725 --> 05:54.769
What you're in here is a street fight,

05:54.977 --> 05:57.063
and you gotta know
who's covering your back.

05:57.230 --> 05:59.607
So, what I guarantee you is this:

06:00.149 --> 06:04.028
You will never see me unprepared,

06:04.195 --> 06:07.198
you'll never see me intimidated,

06:07.365 --> 06:11.953
and you will never,
ever see me throw in the towel.

06:12.119 --> 06:15.248
- Understand?
- I'd certainly hope not.

06:16.499 --> 06:19.835
- I've got Geoff Whalen on line one.
- Okay, thank you.

06:20.044 --> 06:21.545
- May I have a word with you?
- Yes.

06:21.754 --> 06:25.341
Whalen, Donny Douglas here.
I'm calling about Niles Crane. Yeah.

06:25.508 --> 06:28.469
I can't possibly let this man
represent me. I'll be humiliated.

06:28.677 --> 06:30.346
Niles, you have got to hear
this man out.

06:30.513 --> 06:32.765
I'm sorry, this is exactly
what you want in a lawyer,

06:32.932 --> 06:34.475
someone who's not afraid
to show moxie.

06:34.642 --> 06:36.644
He's an inch away
from showing us the full moxie.

06:36.811 --> 06:40.189
You're gonna get hit with a countersuit
for an infliction of pain and distress.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.398
You don't think I can win?

06:41.565 --> 06:44.235
You call York and McFadden, you see
what those bastards had to pay

06:44.401 --> 06:46.654
for trying to pull this same crap
on a client of mine.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.781
Yeah, we're talking big numbers here,
Whalen.

06:48.989 --> 06:50.532
You haven't seen
so many zeros lined up

06:50.699 --> 06:53.619
since Mr. Spock had a book signing.
Yeah.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.081
You gotta hear this.
Come here, come here.

06:58.540 --> 07:01.377
<i>Well, yes, of course,
it's important to be reasonable.</i>

07:01.543 --> 07:03.337
<i>I'm sure we can
move a few things around</i>

07:03.504 --> 07:05.214
<i>and be ready for court
by about next month.</i>

07:06.173 --> 07:07.383
<i>- Mr. Douglas?
- Yeah?</i>

07:07.549 --> 07:11.136
<i>Does this mean you're now
representing Niles Crane?</i>

07:12.805 --> 07:14.807
That's exactly what that means.

07:14.973 --> 07:17.768
And, Whalen, I'll be in touch
about a discovery schedule.

07:17.935 --> 07:20.103
Have a nice day.

07:20.604 --> 07:22.648
- Mr. Douglas, that was brilliant.
- Yes.

07:22.814 --> 07:26.109
My goodness, almost makes me wish
I was still married to Lilith.

07:27.236 --> 07:30.238
Now, we're probably gonna get rolling
sometime this week with depositions.

07:30.405 --> 07:33.325
So, you know, pick a day,
we'll get together, I will prepare you,

07:33.492 --> 07:36.161
but it's gonna be very low-key, casual,
over dinner or something.

07:36.328 --> 07:38.205
- You're due in court in ten minutes.
- Okay.

07:38.372 --> 07:39.414
- And, Donny?
- Yeah?

07:39.581 --> 07:41.541
Mustard.

07:43.293 --> 07:44.836
Jeez, was that there
the whole time?

07:46.254 --> 07:48.298
That's so embarrassing.

07:55.639 --> 07:59.601
And, indeed, I had high hopes
for Niles and Maris,

07:59.809 --> 08:02.729
as is witnessed
by my wedding toast,

08:02.938 --> 08:04.731
in which I combined
my heartfelt sentiments

08:04.898 --> 08:06.691
with apt quotations
from Shakespeare,

08:06.900 --> 08:11.029
jazz great Louis Armstrong
and the poet Catullus.

08:11.655 --> 08:15.200
And so your answer would be,
"Yes, I attended their wedding"?

08:17.660 --> 08:20.163
Once again, Frasier, could you try
to keep your answers brief?

08:20.330 --> 08:23.041
- Well, l...
- Trust me, he did.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.669
All right, all right, look,
I'll try to do better.

08:26.836 --> 08:29.547
I still don't understand why
they're deposing Frasier before Niles.

08:29.714 --> 08:31.591
They like to question friends
and family first

08:31.800 --> 08:35.094
so they get as much information as
they can to try to catch Niles in a lie.

08:35.428 --> 08:37.679
They're also gonna allege that
during the separation,

08:37.889 --> 08:39.224
Niles was wasteful with money.

08:40.308 --> 08:42.309
She's calling me wasteful?

08:42.518 --> 08:45.229
Do you recall what she used to do
when our dogs needed a shampoo?

08:45.396 --> 08:47.815
Yes, she'd fill the bathtub
with Evian.

08:48.024 --> 08:50.151
Half the time,
she'd just get a new dog.

08:52.862 --> 08:53.946
Anyway, look, Frasier,

08:54.113 --> 08:56.616
they might ask you
if you witnessed any examples

08:56.783 --> 09:01.079
of Niles throwing money around.
And your answer would be?

09:03.247 --> 09:06.209
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

09:06.375 --> 09:09.295
The answer is,
"Not to the best of my recollection."

09:09.504 --> 09:14.091
- But I do recall, and I'll be under oath.
- Oh, please, not this again.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.929
As you figured out,
Frasier is a bit of a stickler

09:18.095 --> 09:20.264
when it comes to his ethics,
and I applaud him for it.

09:20.431 --> 09:22.266
- Oh, great.
- More coffee, anyone?

09:22.433 --> 09:24.935
No, thank you, Daphne.
I think I'm just about done here.

09:25.102 --> 09:27.313
In fact, I've got a conference call
back at the office.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.482
I'm gonna check
to see if that's still happening.

09:29.649 --> 09:32.026
Why don't you see if there's questions
we haven't done yet?

09:32.193 --> 09:34.653
- All right?
- Oh, all right, all right.

09:34.862 --> 09:37.907
No, we've done those, all right.
Oh, here's one:

09:38.115 --> 09:42.787
"Can you recall a specific incident
where Maris lost her temper

09:42.953 --> 09:47.625
or behaved in a way you'd characterise
as volatile or unstable?"

09:52.546 --> 09:54.215
You're kidding.

09:54.381 --> 09:57.468
No... Well, based on what?
Oh, please.

09:57.676 --> 09:59.053
- Something wrong?
- No, it's okay.

09:59.219 --> 10:02.181
No, thank you, thank you, Maria, no.
Maris' lawyers, they kill me.

10:02.348 --> 10:04.683
All week long, it's been
one desperate ploy after another.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.685
- This is the best one yet.
- What is it?

10:06.852 --> 10:08.896
Oh, now they're claiming
alienation of affection.

10:09.063 --> 10:10.773
You're kidding me.
After what she did?

10:10.939 --> 10:12.691
Now they're saying that
during the marriage,

10:12.858 --> 10:14.359
Niles was in love
with another woman.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.945
- Who?
- Oh, you.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.909
- Me?
- Dear God.

10:22.117 --> 10:25.245
That's absurd. Have you ever heard
anything so ridiculous?

10:25.412 --> 10:27.331
Well...

10:27.497 --> 10:30.125
Not to the best of my recollection.

10:35.881 --> 10:38.342
Why on earth would they think
Dr. Crane's in love with me?

10:38.508 --> 10:40.052
Oh, something about
a country-club ball

10:40.218 --> 10:42.012
the two of you attended
a few years back.

10:42.220 --> 10:43.889
- This is all based on that?
- Yeah.

10:44.056 --> 10:46.683
You caused quite a stir
on the dance floor or something.

10:46.892 --> 10:49.352
Yeah, we were just putting on a show
for his snobby friends.

10:49.519 --> 10:50.729
You must have been convincing,

10:50.896 --> 10:53.231
because they're gonna subpoena you
for deposition.

10:53.398 --> 10:56.485
We can call their bluff right away,
you can come tomorrow with Frasier.

10:56.693 --> 10:57.861
- Fine by me.
- Okay, great.

10:58.028 --> 11:00.530
Now, I'm gonna have to prepare you
for this because lawyers,

11:00.697 --> 11:03.200
they can twist your words around.
They get a judge to buy it,

11:03.366 --> 11:05.994
because of the prenup,
Maris can really stick it to Niles.

11:06.161 --> 11:08.830
- But I got this conference call...
- Well, I could come with you.

11:08.997 --> 11:11.374
- We'll get it done in an hour.
- Just let me grab me coat.

11:11.541 --> 11:13.293
Don't you worry, Dr. Crane.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.128
Now, Frasier, I hope you realise

11:15.629 --> 11:17.589
they're gonna ask you
about this business too.

11:17.797 --> 11:19.549
- Me?
- Yes, but don't worry.

11:19.716 --> 11:22.093
This is one time
when your compulsive truth-telling

11:22.260 --> 11:24.262
won't get us into any trouble.

11:24.429 --> 11:26.973
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:27.724 --> 11:31.686
Well, that's it. It's over.
It's over, and I've lost.

11:31.853 --> 11:34.397
- Maris has won. Maris always wins.
- Niles.

11:34.564 --> 11:36.149
Niles never wins.

11:37.108 --> 11:40.028
Niles always loses. That's why
Niles lives at the Shangri-la

11:40.195 --> 11:42.155
and drives a hatchback.

11:42.322 --> 11:45.200
Niles, now, get a grip.
Maris' people are just fishing.

11:45.366 --> 11:47.577
We're the only ones who know
how you feel about Daphne.

11:47.785 --> 11:51.122
Today. Tomorrow, everyone will know,
including Daphne.

11:51.331 --> 11:52.665
This is how she's gonna find out.

11:52.874 --> 11:55.335
I wanted to whisper it to her
over a candlelight dinner,

11:55.501 --> 11:58.046
not have it read back to her
by a court stenographer.

11:58.254 --> 12:00.465
What are you talking about?
Frasier's not gonna tell.

12:00.631 --> 12:02.341
He'll be under oath.
What if they ask him?

12:02.508 --> 12:05.219
Well, he'll just say no. Right, Fras?

12:10.641 --> 12:14.145
- Fras?
- Well, it's not that simple.

12:14.353 --> 12:16.063
You heard what he said,
I'll be under oath.

12:16.230 --> 12:18.774
Oh, my God, I can't breathe.

12:19.025 --> 12:20.526
I can't breathe.

12:20.693 --> 12:22.361
Niles. Here.

12:22.820 --> 12:25.448
Put your head between your legs.
I'll get you some water.

12:25.615 --> 12:27.867
You'll be all right.
Just take a couple of deep breaths.

12:28.034 --> 12:32.371
If I could take deep breaths,
it would mean I could breathe.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.623
You're not gonna go
and blow this for him, are you?

12:34.790 --> 12:37.126
There's nothing I'd like to do more
than help my brother.

12:37.293 --> 12:39.378
I'd like to do it
without violating my ethics.

12:39.545 --> 12:41.297
But Maris is responsible
for this divorce.

12:41.464 --> 12:43.632
Niles' feelings for Daphne
has nothing to do with it.

12:43.799 --> 12:46.343
Now, if you cover for Niles,
you won't be doing anything wrong.

12:46.510 --> 12:49.763
Dad, we are talking about perjury.
When is that ever acceptable?

12:49.930 --> 12:52.600
Oh, you want an example? Fine.

12:52.766 --> 12:55.728
Let's say, what if there was a comet
hurtling towards the Earth.

12:55.936 --> 12:56.979
For God's sake.

12:57.146 --> 12:59.356
You could save Earth,
but the only way you could do it

12:59.523 --> 13:02.026
is by lying under oath.
Would you do it then?

13:03.903 --> 13:07.031
- Who am I lying to, the comet?
- Oh, just answer the question.

13:07.239 --> 13:09.491
All right, I suppose
that in certain extreme cases...

13:09.658 --> 13:11.201
So then you'd lie?

13:11.410 --> 13:14.663
To save mankind
from a talking comet, yes.

13:14.830 --> 13:15.998
But you won't lie for Niles?

13:16.165 --> 13:18.083
You make me sound
like some insensitive lout

13:18.250 --> 13:20.377
who isn't aware
that my brother's out there in pain.

13:20.586 --> 13:22.296
Isn't that Niles' water?

13:22.504 --> 13:24.339
I'm just checking to see
it's not too cold.

13:26.592 --> 13:28.135
Niles?

13:28.302 --> 13:31.138
- Niles?
- I'm over here.

13:32.764 --> 13:34.766
The piano. Niles.

13:34.933 --> 13:36.810
Please, please,
just come out from under there.

13:36.977 --> 13:39.062
- Things are not that bad.
- Not that bad?

13:39.271 --> 13:41.064
Daphne is going to find out
about this.

13:41.273 --> 13:43.984
Not if you crawl out
before she gets home.

13:44.568 --> 13:47.237
Niles, please, come out here.
Now, come on.

13:47.404 --> 13:49.614
Why should I?
There's nothing for me out there.

13:49.781 --> 13:53.577
It's all lawyers and ex-wives
and broken hearts.

13:53.994 --> 13:57.581
All I have to contend with under here
is a couple of dust bunnies.

13:57.789 --> 14:00.125
A few cobwebs.

14:00.292 --> 14:02.627
Some kind of a nest.

14:03.295 --> 14:06.923
Dear God, doesn't your vacuum
come with any attachments?

14:07.132 --> 14:09.384
All right, just sit tight
and I'll get you a wet cloth.

14:09.551 --> 14:11.428
Look what you've done.
I hope you're happy now.

14:11.595 --> 14:13.680
Do you really wanna see me
lying under oath?

14:13.847 --> 14:16.182
It's better than seeing your brother
lying under a piano.

14:16.349 --> 14:18.226
I can't believe you're being casual
about this.

14:18.393 --> 14:20.770
Do you realise you're asking me
to do something unethical?

14:20.979 --> 14:22.647
For God's sake,
nobody's even gonna know.

14:22.814 --> 14:24.149
Yes, but that's the point.

14:24.316 --> 14:26.318
Ethics are what we do
when no one else is looking.

14:26.484 --> 14:28.361
For heaven's sake,
I learned that from you.

14:28.528 --> 14:30.572
Are you saying you wouldn't
have trouble with this?

14:30.739 --> 14:32.157
- Niles, here.
- Thank you.

14:32.323 --> 14:34.117
Let me tell you something.

14:34.284 --> 14:37.162
One time, when I was on the force,
I saw a guy shoot somebody.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.539
When we caught him,
I started to read him his rights,

14:39.706 --> 14:42.542
but he slipped out of his cuffs
and swung at me, so I didn't finish.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.294
Two months later, I'm on the stand

14:44.460 --> 14:46.838
and his lawyer asks me
if I read him his rights in full.

14:47.005 --> 14:48.673
Now, if I say no, this guy walks.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.384
And this guy's been in and out of jail
all his life.

14:51.551 --> 14:53.386
He could have read me his rights.
So I say:

14:53.553 --> 14:57.515
"Yes, I did, I read them in full."
I lied under oath.

14:57.682 --> 14:59.726
Now, you might think
that I did an unethical thing,

14:59.892 --> 15:03.813
but there's not a doubt in my mind
that I did the right thing.

15:08.151 --> 15:10.278
Well, Dad, I'm still not sure
what I'm gonna do.

15:10.486 --> 15:12.488
Why do you have to make everything
so complicated?

15:12.655 --> 15:14.824
I don't know. But I'm never
gonna figure out anything

15:14.991 --> 15:16.367
with you barking in my ear.

15:16.534 --> 15:18.202
- Where are you going?
- To get some air.

15:18.369 --> 15:22.248
Oh, yeah, yeah, run away,
just like you always do.

15:22.415 --> 15:24.458
Boy, I sometimes don't understand
your brother.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.837
I guess some of us can deal
with a tough situation head-on,

15:28.004 --> 15:31.132
and others just need an escape.

15:36.637 --> 15:39.432
Dr. Crane, they'll be ready for you
in just a few minutes.

15:39.598 --> 15:41.350
Thank you.

15:43.144 --> 15:47.398
- Frasier. Hi. Have you...?
- Oh, Niles. No, not yet.

15:47.565 --> 15:50.109
Daphne's still
in the conference room.

15:50.276 --> 15:52.445
The place is slithering
with Maris' lawyers.

15:52.611 --> 15:55.114
Oh, yes. Never a mongoose around
when you need one.

15:56.740 --> 15:59.034
Listen, I'm sorry I ever put you
in this position.

15:59.243 --> 16:00.327
Niles, it's not your fault.

16:00.494 --> 16:02.746
No, listen, I thought a lot
about this last night,

16:02.913 --> 16:04.915
and I realised the way
I was carrying on yesterday

16:05.082 --> 16:08.419
was just making it harder for you to do
whatever you feel is the right thing.

16:08.627 --> 16:10.629
I'm still not really sure
what the right thing is.

16:10.796 --> 16:12.506
Well, if it makes any difference,

16:12.673 --> 16:15.092
I've decided to tell Donny
everything about Daphne.

16:15.301 --> 16:16.427
- Really?
- Yes.

16:16.635 --> 16:19.263
- He can proceed however he sees fit.
- But why, Niles?

16:19.430 --> 16:21.306
Well, I started to wonder,

16:21.473 --> 16:25.227
maybe my feelings for Daphne
did affect my marriage.

16:25.394 --> 16:28.272
Maybe on some intuitive level,
Maris knew all along.

16:28.439 --> 16:30.774
I can't be certain that's not
what drove her to Schenkman.

16:30.941 --> 16:33.944
Listen to me. The only reason
that marriage lasted as long as it did

16:34.111 --> 16:36.113
was because of the effort
that you put into it,

16:36.280 --> 16:38.866
from the moment you slipped
that ring onto her bony finger

16:39.032 --> 16:41.201
and it slipped right off again.

16:42.870 --> 16:45.664
There is no way
that this divorce is your fault.

16:46.832 --> 16:49.376
- I wish I could be sure of that.
- Okay, Frasier... Oh, Niles.

16:49.543 --> 16:51.461
Good. Frasier,
they're just about ready for you.

16:51.628 --> 16:54.464
Wait for me outside the conference
room. And don't go in without me.

16:54.631 --> 16:56.383
I want a word
alone with your brother here.

16:56.550 --> 16:58.385
Right.

16:58.552 --> 17:00.429
Wish there was something
I could do, Niles.

17:00.637 --> 17:03.181
Well, there is.
When you go home this afternoon,

17:03.348 --> 17:05.599
leave a bottle of sherry
under the piano.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.897
Wait for me. Okay.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.568
Glad you're here. There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.736
- Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
- No, me first.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.239
Now, the only way this relationship
is gonna work, Niles,

17:19.406 --> 17:21.241
is if we're completely honest
with each other.

17:21.449 --> 17:22.659
- I agree.
- I've been digging.

17:22.826 --> 17:24.493
I found out
you've been holding out on me.

17:24.661 --> 17:26.079
Yes, and I'm very sorry about that.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.330
You didn't tell me
where Maris' money came from.

17:28.498 --> 17:30.125
It's never easy...

17:31.001 --> 17:32.919
- Maris' money?
- Yeah.

17:33.128 --> 17:36.172
I mean, you told me that Maris'
family money came from timber.

17:36.381 --> 17:37.757
It did. It did come from timber.

17:39.134 --> 17:43.430
- Oh, that's what you really think.
- Well, of course, it's true.

17:43.638 --> 17:45.557
And that's what all of Maris' friends
think too?

17:45.723 --> 17:46.891
All those country-club snobs

17:47.058 --> 17:49.227
who would kill for a good piece of dirt
on someone?

17:49.435 --> 17:50.520
What are you talking about?

17:50.687 --> 17:53.982
If her family money didn't come
from timber, where did it come from?

17:55.000 --> 18:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:08.538 --> 18:10.748
Urinal cakes?

18:13.501 --> 18:16.671
I don't believe this.

18:16.838 --> 18:20.258
All these years,
the doyenne of Seattle's elite

18:20.425 --> 18:22.260
looking down her nose
at everyone in sight,

18:22.427 --> 18:24.470
she owes it all to this.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.807
She's managed to have her urinal cake
and eat it too.

18:29.016 --> 18:31.519
Yes, I think we now have
what's known in the legal profession

18:31.686 --> 18:33.062
as a bargaining chip.

18:33.229 --> 18:35.565
Are you kidding?
She'd give anything to keep this quiet.

18:35.731 --> 18:37.483
All right, let me go talk
to Maris' lawyers.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.069
No, no, no, there's some news
you want to deliver yourself.

18:40.236 --> 18:42.780
- May I?
- Absolutely.

18:47.368 --> 18:49.995
Hello, Marta. Like to speak to Maris.

18:50.162 --> 18:51.580
Oh, why not?

18:54.083 --> 18:56.293
She's in the final level
of her guru serenity training,

18:56.460 --> 18:59.380
the weeklong vow of silence,
day six.

18:59.588 --> 19:02.091
No, that's all right. She doesn't
have to come to the phone.

19:02.299 --> 19:07.054
Just give her this message:
I've flushed out her family secret.

19:09.014 --> 19:13.102
Hello, Maris.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.523
I can't remember the last time
I felt this way.

19:17.731 --> 19:20.651
The air is sweeter,
colours are brighter.

19:20.818 --> 19:23.112
It's as if my very senses
have come alive.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.739
It makes perfect sense.
You've just won your life back.

19:25.948 --> 19:27.783
Frasier, watch this.
Excuse me, excuse me.

19:27.950 --> 19:31.370
Today's special blend,
Jamaican Blue Mountain.

19:31.578 --> 19:33.414
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, Niles, that was very good.

19:33.580 --> 19:34.915
That's my favourite. Well done.

19:35.082 --> 19:37.751
The beans were gathered on
the shady side of the northern slope...

19:37.918 --> 19:39.586
Don't push it.

19:40.254 --> 19:42.923
I still can't believe this is all over.

19:43.090 --> 19:46.051
And I never dreamed
I'd get a settlement like that.

19:46.260 --> 19:50.347
I'll be able to get my whole life back,
my apartment, my car.

19:50.514 --> 19:52.266
I owe it all to one amazing man.

19:52.432 --> 19:55.060
Well, thank you, Niles,
but I can't take all the credit.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.396
I know, you're thinking of Donny.

19:57.562 --> 19:59.606
Well, don't think
I'm not grateful for all you did.

19:59.773 --> 20:03.110
To tell the truth, if it hadn't been for me
badgering you to change your lawyers,

20:03.318 --> 20:05.821
Donny Douglas never would've
come into your life.

20:08.156 --> 20:11.076
Of course, we mustn't forget
Roz's part in all of this.

20:11.284 --> 20:13.662
Waiter. Who understands
why anything happens?

20:13.829 --> 20:14.871
I mean, it's remarkable

20:15.038 --> 20:17.958
how completely one's life can change
in an instant.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.838
Oh, Niles.

20:25.507 --> 20:26.550
Hi, you two.

20:26.716 --> 20:28.760
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hi. Hi, how are you doing?

20:28.927 --> 20:32.389
Oh, congratulations, Dr. Crane.
I'm so happy for you.

20:32.597 --> 20:33.640
Thank you, Daphne.

20:33.807 --> 20:35.308
What are you two doing here
together?

20:35.517 --> 20:36.977
Oh, well, you know,
we were talking,

20:37.143 --> 20:40.438
we got a little hungry, and then
we drank a little bit too much wine,

20:40.605 --> 20:41.940
and we laughed a little too much.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.150
Listen to us,
we sound like an old married couple.

20:44.317 --> 20:47.278
I know. You know, Frasier, if you
hadn't brought Niles to the office,

20:47.445 --> 20:48.988
then none of this
would have happened.

20:49.155 --> 20:50.198
I guess I owe you one.

20:50.365 --> 20:54.035
Well, now, we mustn't forget
Roz's part in all of this.

20:56.663 --> 20:59.332

What is that?

21:00.625 --> 21:03.044
Cherry bark and almonds.

21:04.305 --> 21:10.575
