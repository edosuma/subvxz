WEBVTT

00:05.238 --> 00:08.207
Okay, Liv and Maddie

00:08.209 --> 00:10.275
will be back from their
driving test any second.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.944
Ready to celebrate?

00:11.946 --> 00:13.612
Check it.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.884
¶ Sing it loud!

00:18.886 --> 00:20.886
Bam! What?!

00:21.955 --> 00:24.156
Ooh, I can't wait
to get my license

00:24.158 --> 00:26.158
and be able to go
wherever I want.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.960
( Laughs )
Within the city limits.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.561
Before my curfew.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.531
In a beat-up minivan
that smells like Joey's feet.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.933
Still freedom.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.168
Whoo-hoo!

00:36.170 --> 00:37.269
Freedom?

00:37.271 --> 00:40.139
( Scoffs ) Try loss of freedom.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.007
Who wants to drive
when you can sit shotgun

00:42.009 --> 00:43.609
and text until
your thumbs fall off?

00:43.611 --> 00:44.977
( Chuckles ) Not me.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.046
I'm stoked for Maddie.
Having a license...

00:47.048 --> 00:48.981
that means she can go
anywhere and do anything.

00:48.983 --> 00:51.050
That a responsible
teenager would do

00:51.052 --> 00:52.684
after getting approval
from her father.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.854
Not that I've ever asked her
not to get approval.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.122
Why am I still talking?

00:57.124 --> 00:58.223
( Mouthing )

00:58.225 --> 00:59.324
Why are you in my house?

00:59.326 --> 01:00.959
Why haven't you
gotten a haircut?

01:00.961 --> 01:03.629
We've all got questions.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.731
( Gasps ) There she is.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.266
- ( All cheer )
- Congratulations, Liv.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.735
One of our two new drivers.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.270
Yes.
Hold your rah-rahs.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.705
Only one of us passed.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.674
Total bummer-rang.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.276
Aw, you'll get it
next time, kid.

01:17.278 --> 01:20.179
No.
I'm the one who passed.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.981
( Laughs ) License to surprise!

01:24.017 --> 01:26.351
Wait, if you passed,
that means Maddie failed.

01:26.353 --> 01:29.054
Maddie doesn't fail anything.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.322
- Ooh!
- Oh!

01:30.324 --> 01:32.591
( Shouts )

01:32.593 --> 01:35.794
Burn it!
Burn it all!

01:35.796 --> 01:37.229
( All chatter )

01:37.231 --> 01:39.064
Well...

01:39.066 --> 01:41.233
I failed.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.335
Guess I know what it feels
like to be a loser now.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.138
You know what
I'm talking about, Joey.

01:47.373 --> 01:50.342
Ouch!
I would call that a drive-by...

01:50.344 --> 01:52.344
if you had your license.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.979
( Imitates explosion )

01:57.383 --> 01:58.750
So what happened?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.252
I will tell you what happened.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.087
The dmv discriminates.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.256
Yeah. They only
give their licenses

02:04.258 --> 02:07.326
to people who can make
left-hand turns.

02:08.828 --> 02:11.296
They do come in handy
when you want to go left.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.999
Why would you purposefully turn

02:14.001 --> 02:15.868
into oncoming traffic
when you can go up one block

02:15.870 --> 02:17.369
and make three rights?

02:19.172 --> 02:21.306
Who needs their license
anyway, am I right?

02:21.308 --> 02:24.343
I do!
I need my license!

02:24.345 --> 02:27.412
Don't worry, Maddie. I'll drive
you anywhere you want to go.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.814
Seriously,
why am I still talking?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.215
Why am I still here?

02:30.217 --> 02:31.750
I'll go get my hair cut.

02:32.685 --> 02:36.955
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

02:36.957 --> 02:38.323
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

03:30.010 --> 03:32.277
Guys! I have something
really exciting to say.

03:32.279 --> 03:36.748
How about you pause
your piehole for two hours?

03:38.284 --> 03:40.285
We'll get to you later.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.788
We're all listening, Liv.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.956
Okay.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.124
There is a major film

03:46.126 --> 03:47.993
shooting in Wisconsin
this summer,

03:47.995 --> 03:49.228
and I'm up for a big part.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.329
How exciting!

03:50.331 --> 03:53.966
It's based on some book
about wolves in space.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.103
Both: "Space werewolves!"

03:58.105 --> 04:02.307
( Squeals ) That is
my favorite graphic novel.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.542
No way!

04:03.544 --> 04:05.344
They want me to play Tristan.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.980
As in Tristan lycanth?

04:07.982 --> 04:08.981
Yeah.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.450
The hero?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.418
Ha ha, but Tristan's a boy.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.354
Technically half-boy,
half-werewolf.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.423
But he is definitely
not a girl.

04:19.359 --> 04:21.426
Right.
Not yet.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.362
But the people making the movie

04:23.364 --> 04:27.266
Where I dreamt that I was on
an international space station

04:27.268 --> 04:28.867
and I saved the earth
by singing the high note

04:28.869 --> 04:30.969
that shattered the asteroid
before it hit earth. Aah!

04:30.971 --> 04:32.371
( Sings high note )

04:32.373 --> 04:35.107
( Imitates explosion )

04:35.109 --> 04:36.808
I love that episode.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.910
Really? 'Cause I had
some logic problems with it.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.178
But you sparkled, honey.

04:41.215 --> 04:44.316
that they're considering
changing the role of Tristan

04:44.318 --> 04:46.885
into a girl just for me.

04:48.187 --> 04:50.222
I had to stop Liv
for her own good.

04:50.224 --> 04:52.124
Fanboys are crazy.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.825
I should know.
I'm one of them.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.027
( Clicks tongue )

04:55.029 --> 04:57.229
We're talking about
Tristan lycanth.

04:57.231 --> 05:00.365
Keeper of the claw of freedom.

05:00.367 --> 05:04.236
Does this match this?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.406
( Mouthing )

05:10.243 --> 05:11.510
- What's up, diggie?
- What's up, Rooney?

05:11.512 --> 05:14.313
'Sup with your hair?

05:15.882 --> 05:17.282
You did not get a haircut

05:17.284 --> 05:18.817
just because
my dad told you to.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.020
( Scoffs )
No. Not at all.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.556
I totally needed a trim.
Do you think he'll like it?

05:25.925 --> 05:28.427
Diggie, you can't let him
push you around like this.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.095
I mean, your hair
was a hot mess,

05:30.097 --> 05:32.264
but that's not the point.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.066
I can't help it, okay?
I want him to like me.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.300
He's your dad.
And you and me are...

05:35.302 --> 05:37.536
Whatever we are.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.172
Totally. Whatever.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.542
Um... you just need
to find something

05:43.544 --> 05:45.410
that you and my dad both like
and bond over that.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.012
Oh, yeah, okay, great.
Let's see.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.581
He likes growling at me.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.416
You know what else he likes...

05:51.418 --> 05:52.617
barbecuing.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.420
Grilling sure beats growling.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.357
And, if he starts to like me,

05:58.359 --> 05:59.858
I could help you prep
for your driver's test.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.493
Aww.
( Laughs, snorts )

06:01.495 --> 06:03.995
That's so sweet.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.430
- Hey, dad.
- ( Exclaims )

06:05.432 --> 06:07.032
( Laughs )

06:08.568 --> 06:10.402
Dude, I'm kidding.
Ha ha.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.937
But he won't be.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.943
Oh! Hey, Liv, you want
some chocolate pudding?

06:17.945 --> 06:19.945
We found a big bowl
of it in the fridge.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.314
Um, boys, that's not
chocolate pudding.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.549
That's my organic
face mask from Paris.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.485
Oh, ho ho ho.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.254
Fancy pudding.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.456
Yeah. It's made
with orangutan poop.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.193
( Sputters )

06:35.461 --> 06:38.563
Well, whatever that monkey
ate was delicious.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.335
Is that banana?

06:43.337 --> 06:44.903
Okay, just...

06:44.905 --> 06:47.305
Eww, Joey...

06:47.307 --> 06:48.340
( clears throat )

06:48.342 --> 06:49.641
Get this.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.510
Somehow word has spread
through the blogosphere

06:51.512 --> 06:54.012
that I'm up for the role of
Tristan in "space werewolves."

06:54.014 --> 06:57.682
Not sure how that info
leaked out onto the Internet.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.951
We would never
post that juicy tidbit

06:59.953 --> 07:02.721
on the Stevens point
"space werewolves" fan page

07:02.723 --> 07:05.056
in hopes of enraging
local tristanites.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.291
( Laughs )

07:06.293 --> 07:09.261
Liv will thank me
for this later.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.962
Let me guess.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.064
The fanboys
were none too pleased

07:13.066 --> 07:15.066
about you playing Tristan.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.468
You probably want
to throw in the towel

07:16.470 --> 07:18.570
and back out.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.005
Uh, no.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.473
I mean, why do I care
what nerd nation

07:21.475 --> 07:25.477
Because we are a powerful
force to be reckoned with...

07:25.479 --> 07:28.079
I mean, they are!

07:28.081 --> 07:29.414
( Clears throat ) Whatever.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.116
This weekend I have
a personal appearance

07:31.118 --> 07:33.251
at Neville's novelty shoppe
to sign "sing it loud!" DVDs.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.519
Why don't you guys
come with me?

07:34.521 --> 07:38.990
Liv, Neville's
is fanboy central.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.561
and then find out that you don't
know what you're talking about

07:42.563 --> 07:44.062
they will eat you alive.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.132
He's a werewolf
and he lives in space.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.100
I think anything else I need to
learn about him will be in here.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.369
I can probably finish
this by Saturday, yeah?

07:51.371 --> 07:52.604
Liv, that's volume 1.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.440
There are 64 volumes.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.641
Hah!

07:56.643 --> 07:58.410
No wonder they're making
this into a movie.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.278
Who would want
to read all that?

08:03.516 --> 08:05.417
Ugh!

08:05.419 --> 08:07.185
Ugh!

08:08.187 --> 08:10.522
323 pages

08:10.524 --> 08:12.090
of "rules of the road,"

08:12.092 --> 08:13.325
and not once did they admit

08:13.327 --> 08:15.093
that turning left
into oncoming traffic

08:15.095 --> 08:17.095
is insane.

08:17.097 --> 08:21.166
420 pages of werewolves
and spaceships,

08:21.168 --> 08:24.736
is that I think I could totally
rock Tristan's space suit.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.371
Yeah...

08:26.373 --> 08:28.340
just wait till they get
to the battle of mirth.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.374
( Imitates gunfire )

08:29.376 --> 08:30.742
That's when he meets kytra,

08:30.744 --> 08:32.410
and that's when the adventure
really kicks off.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.778
( Gasps )

08:33.780 --> 08:37.716
You undercover Sci-Fi geek.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.052
You've totally read this book.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.487
Yeah, I've actually
read them all.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.289
I love them.
And I have to admit...

08:44.291 --> 08:47.292
I am a little on the fence about
you playing Tristan myself.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.095
Okay...
one, how dare you.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.732
And two, help me.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.234
Okay, Liv, why are you
wigging out?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.136
Because I really
want this role.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.437
I mean, I know that
I've been playing it cool,

08:59.439 --> 09:01.439
but this is way bigger
than my show

09:01.441 --> 09:04.676
and it could send me into a
completely new acting stratosphere.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.779
I just have no idea how
to impress these fanboys.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.281
Okay, well,
I would love to help you

09:09.283 --> 09:11.182
but, Liv, my driver's test
is on the same day

09:11.184 --> 09:12.484
as your autograph signing.

09:12.486 --> 09:13.685
And I still have no idea

09:13.687 --> 09:16.087
how to make
a stupid left-hand turn.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.124
I have a twin-sane idea!

09:20.359 --> 09:23.528
This Saturday,
I'll be you and you be me.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.196
- Wait, you mean like...
- A switch-a-Rooney.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.631
( Both scream )

09:28.467 --> 09:30.368
I'll face your fanboys.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.237
And I will take
your driver's test.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.139
Perfect!
( Laughs )

09:34.141 --> 09:35.774
Why is this bed so squishy?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.246
( Clears throat )

09:41.248 --> 09:45.450
Because I am sitting
on a pizza.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.553
A girl gets hungry
at 3:00 A.M.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.160
( Muttering )

09:55.162 --> 09:58.263
Web... and that's how
I slay the dragon.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.367
Hey, Artie, you got a minute?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.468
Hey, Joey.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.803
You got a girlfriend?

10:04.805 --> 10:07.305
Burn!

10:07.307 --> 10:11.676
You took your mom
to the freshman dance last fall.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.583
So, what brings you
crawling back

10:18.585 --> 10:20.485
to the society of space...
Space... space...

10:20.487 --> 10:22.220
Were... were... were...
Wol... wol... wol...

10:22.222 --> 10:24.122
Wol... wol... wol...
Ves... ves?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.391
( Howls )

10:26.393 --> 10:28.727
I was voted out of the society

10:28.729 --> 10:31.429
for suggesting that
wolf tails were stupid.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.131
Was I wrong?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.300
People, was I wrong?

10:37.203 --> 10:38.703
I want to talk to you
about my sister Liv.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.372
No LA LA LA LA.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.507
We do not speak the name
of that she-devil

10:42.509 --> 10:45.176
who wants to desecrate Tristan.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.544
Unless she sent you
to ask me to prom,

10:46.546 --> 10:48.107
in which case,
let her know I say maybe.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.882
Be gone with you.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.184
( Yelps )

10:53.186 --> 10:55.153
Listen, Artie.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.655
We have a common enemy here,

10:56.657 --> 10:58.289
and we need to work together

10:58.291 --> 11:00.325
to defend the iconic character

11:00.327 --> 11:02.594
that is Tristan.

11:02.596 --> 11:05.697
We were once powerful
allies, you and I.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.633
An uneasy alliance.

11:08.635 --> 11:12.237
My wolf ears are perked.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.306
Liv will be down
at Neville's tomorrow.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.942
I need you to show her
the real fangs

11:17.944 --> 11:20.612
of a true
"space werewolves" fanboy.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.547
Fanboy?

11:22.549 --> 11:25.350
That term is derogatory, sir.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.554
We prefer
"fantasy enthusiast."

11:29.556 --> 11:30.955
So will you do it?

11:30.957 --> 11:33.858
Oh, sounds great, Joey.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.728
I'd happily waltz
right into your trap.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.963
Do you take me for a fool?!

11:40.700 --> 11:42.701
Yes.
Yes, I do.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.772
But as Tristan himself
would say...

11:47.774 --> 11:49.407
( In a deep voice )
When an enemy

11:49.409 --> 11:52.711
- offers his paw, lick it.
- ( Mouthing along )

11:52.713 --> 11:55.947
If only to tear off
his hind leg...

11:55.949 --> 11:57.682
Tomorrow.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.552
Oh!

12:00.554 --> 12:01.720
Saying no to that would be like

12:01.722 --> 12:03.688
saying no to Tristan himself.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.523
Well played, lone wolf.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.525
Well played indeed.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.594
( Howls loudly )

12:09.596 --> 12:10.695
Aah!

12:12.832 --> 12:14.799
Nerds!

12:20.473 --> 12:21.473
( Blows whistle )

12:21.475 --> 12:23.641
Pull over to talk or text.

12:24.810 --> 12:28.446
Mmm! Gotta love
a brown sugar glaze.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.781
( Blows whistle )

12:29.783 --> 12:31.950
No eating in the halls.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.018
I can't help it, coach.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.820
Just falls off the bone.

12:35.822 --> 12:39.791
That's some solid-looking
barbecue you got there.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.793
Thank you.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.763
I followed a recipe
from "barbecue monthly."

12:46.031 --> 12:49.501
Oh! Too much black pepper.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.536
Ah, it was all so confusing.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.872
My father's...

12:53.874 --> 12:54.939
A vegetarian.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.342
( Winces )

12:57.344 --> 12:59.544
I just have no one to guide me.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.813
Well, I don't like to brag,

13:01.815 --> 13:04.482
but last summer I did win

13:04.484 --> 13:08.353
the Stevens point "thrilla
on the grilla" cook-off.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.523
Oh, yeah! Coach Rooney
took the barbecue bait.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.424
But seriously, not one word
about the haircut?

13:13.426 --> 13:15.426
What gives?

13:17.696 --> 13:20.665
Hey, check it out...

13:20.667 --> 13:22.567
I sold Liv's toothbrush
to a "sing it loud!" Fan

13:22.569 --> 13:24.702
and got us a bunch
of gummy eyeballs.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.437
( Mouths )

13:26.439 --> 13:29.407
Too bad she only has
one toothbrush.

13:29.409 --> 13:33.444
Oh, please... I picked that one
off the sidewalk out front.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.715
Oh...

13:40.853 --> 13:42.620
The switch-a-Rooney was on.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.455
It took me four hours
to do my hair

13:44.457 --> 13:46.491
and Liv made me sleep with my
head hanging off the mattress

13:46.493 --> 13:47.959
to protect the pouf.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.394
( Snorts )

13:49.396 --> 13:51.863
I drooled into my own nose.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.438
( Cheering )

14:00.440 --> 14:02.907
( Scattered applause )

14:06.745 --> 14:08.346
<i>( Object shatters )</i>

14:09.949 --> 14:12.750
Thank you all
so much for coming

14:12.752 --> 14:15.086
to the season 4 DVD signing

14:15.088 --> 14:17.422
of ¶ sing it loud!

14:21.594 --> 14:22.927
Artie's here.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.864
Let the games begin.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.398
Liv Rooney.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.100
Are the rumors true that you,

14:29.102 --> 14:32.670
a girl,
might play Tristan lycanth?

14:32.672 --> 14:34.072
( Clicks, drops pen )

14:34.074 --> 14:36.541
It's true, fanboy.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.842
What say you?

14:37.844 --> 14:41.412
I say it's
intergalactic blasphemy!

14:41.414 --> 14:43.414
And I shall prove
you're unworthy.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.384
Be warned my minions
are live blogging.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.921
King Artie the magnificent
at wolfspot dot howl.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.055
Ha ha.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.658
Bring it on, king Artie.

14:54.426 --> 14:57.695
Speak for Tristan's lineage.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.099
Who are his parents?

15:03.068 --> 15:06.704
Liv is about to go
down in flames.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.106
His parents

15:08.108 --> 15:10.775
are the werewolf magrol

15:10.777 --> 15:12.911
and queen Zira.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.546
Bam! What?!

15:16.849 --> 15:19.617
( Laughs )

15:19.619 --> 15:23.521
I mean,
space-tastic question.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.056
( Laughs )

15:25.058 --> 15:27.592
Both: Maddie.

15:29.895 --> 15:32.931
Okay, we are good to go.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.632
Uh, I think we're
forgetting one thing.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.169
Oh! Ha ha.
Yes.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.438
Lip gloss.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.474
No, it says here you're
required to wear glasses

15:43.476 --> 15:45.109
to drive.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.946
( Laughs )

15:47.948 --> 15:50.848
Does it say that?

15:50.850 --> 15:53.551
I thought I just needed
those for the picture.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.053
( Both laugh )

15:55.055 --> 15:56.621
Put 'em on.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.660
O. M. Eyeballs.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.530
Now start the car
and put it in gear.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.932
Absolutely.
( Laughs )

16:07.934 --> 16:10.601
If you could just...
Direct me to the...

16:10.603 --> 16:12.770
Ignition.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.106
( Laughing )

16:15.108 --> 16:16.574
No?

16:18.077 --> 16:19.911
<i>( Starts ignition )</i>

16:19.913 --> 16:22.480
All right.
This is good.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.983
Now merge left.
There's construction ahead.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.485
- Uh...
- Go left. I said left!

16:27.487 --> 16:28.486
- <i>( Tires squeal )</i>
<i>- ( Screams )</i>

16:28.488 --> 16:29.787
Okay, too far, too far.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.522
- Okay.
- Garbage can.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.591
- I don't...
- <i>( Tires squealing )</i>

16:33.593 --> 16:35.259

- ( Thuds )

16:35.261 --> 16:36.828
<i>( Horn blares )</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:38.529
Okay.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.931
Pull the vehicle over.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.733
Uh, uh, okay.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.601
Slow down.
Slow down!

16:43.603 --> 16:44.769
- I'm not... I...
- Mailbox.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.104
- Mailbox!
- What?!

16:54.079 --> 16:56.080
So... ( Sighs )

16:56.082 --> 16:58.149
Pass?

17:03.956 --> 17:06.057
Here we are...
a couple of dudes

17:06.059 --> 17:08.559
getting ready to do some
chillin' and grillin'.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.262
Are you okay that I
just called you a dude?

17:11.264 --> 17:13.164
Relax, we're barbecuing.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.867
Everybody's a dude.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.169
Okay. Let's do this.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.038
Absolutely.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.640
First, I need you
to do a few things.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.842
Hit me.
Whatever you want.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.677
Shuck the corn?
Season the meat?

17:26.679 --> 17:29.313
Mow the lawn.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.815
Um, what?

17:30.817 --> 17:33.184
And clean the gutters,
rotate my tires,

17:33.186 --> 17:35.720
grout the tub,
and empty the dishwasher.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.622
Dude.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.825
What does that have
to do with barbecuing?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.593
I thought you came here
to learn.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.328
Let me go get the lawn mower.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.596
<i>( Door opens )</i>

17:45.598 --> 17:47.265
I knew exactly
what diggie was doing.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.234
Using barbecue to soften up
the old man?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.603
If he wanted to get
on my good side,

17:52.605 --> 17:54.105
he was going to have to get
on the good side

17:54.107 --> 17:56.908
of my to-do list.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.844
Finally, a little thrilla
on the grilla!

17:59.846 --> 18:02.647
All those chores
made me hungry.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.782
( Snaps )

18:04.784 --> 18:06.584
That's mine.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.021
What... did you forget
to bring your own steak?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.358
Maybe next time.

18:17.996 --> 18:19.363
Next time?

18:19.365 --> 18:22.300
I'm in!
( Laughs )

18:22.302 --> 18:24.602
- ( Sizzles )
- Aah!

18:24.604 --> 18:27.338
"Bring your own steak."
Classic!

18:29.775 --> 18:32.643
Why are you messing
with that poor boy?

18:32.645 --> 18:35.646
I'm just making sure he's
good enough for my daughter.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.648
And I'm done for the day.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.351
Don't tell Maddie,

18:40.353 --> 18:42.653
but except
for that stupid name,

18:42.655 --> 18:44.689
diggie's all right.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.294
Final question, girl.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.398
When Tristan split
the galactic pangaea,

18:54.400 --> 18:57.335
what did he say
to the scattering colonies?

18:59.238 --> 19:01.806
"Run to the stars, wolves.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.041
- ( Mouthing along )
- But always put first your families.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.376
For their love

19:05.378 --> 19:07.645
keeps you tethered
to the universe."

19:09.982 --> 19:12.216
( Sighs ) Wow.
You've gotta admit...

19:12.218 --> 19:14.118
Maddie's making Liv
look really good.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.953
She's not fooling anyone.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.956
Well, except everyone here.

19:20.025 --> 19:24.228
Well, Liv Rooney...

19:24.230 --> 19:26.430
I'm sold.

19:26.432 --> 19:31.068
I mean, you will make
a great Tristan lycanth.

19:31.070 --> 19:35.206
All hail the she-Tristan!

19:35.208 --> 19:38.442
( Howling loudly )

19:38.444 --> 19:40.378
And, fyi...

19:40.380 --> 19:43.681
I currently am available
for le prom.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.984
( Chuckles, roars )

19:46.986 --> 19:48.419
But your window of opportunity

19:48.421 --> 19:51.322
is closing.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.823
Boop!

19:52.825 --> 19:54.225
Artie.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.027
Are you serious?

19:56.029 --> 19:58.996
You can accept
my sister playing Tristan?

19:58.998 --> 20:01.365
What part of...
( Howls loudly )

20:01.367 --> 20:02.833
Don't you understand?

20:02.835 --> 20:06.404
Okay, so Parker and I
are the only ones

20:06.406 --> 20:08.339
that have a problem with this?

20:08.341 --> 20:09.974
Um, speak for yourself.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.375
She won me over too.

20:12.978 --> 20:15.079
Artie, tail me.

20:17.416 --> 20:21.485
( Singing stately tune )

( Howls )

20:24.791 --> 20:27.458
( Howling )

20:27.460 --> 20:29.794
It was at that moment
that I realized

20:29.796 --> 20:31.429
I was the crazy fanboy

20:31.431 --> 20:33.097
that I was trying
to protect Liv from.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.433
I was untethered
from my family.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.401
I was the lone wolf.

20:37.403 --> 20:41.739
And I should not have eaten
15 gummy eyeballs.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.108
You know what, Artie...

20:44.110 --> 20:46.477
tail me too.

20:48.313 --> 20:53.017
All hail the she-Tristan!

20:53.019 --> 20:56.954
( Howling )

21:00.325 --> 21:02.526
Let me make one thing clear.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.062
This was the last
switch-a-Rooney.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.430
You did it when you were 6.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.832
And I wrote your names
on your forehead

21:07.834 --> 21:10.534
in permanent marker.

21:10.536 --> 21:13.371
Don't make me do that again.

21:13.373 --> 21:17.241
Ah, yes...
the summer of headbands.

21:17.243 --> 21:20.111
To be fair, though,
we rocked the headband look.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.979
( Laughs )

21:21.981 --> 21:23.447
Ha ha fun fun.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.450
Maddie, no license
till you're 17.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.452
Rock that look.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.856
17?!
Seriously?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.057
You want to make it 18?

21:33.059 --> 21:35.159
Ah, 17.
Looking forward to it.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.295
And Liv,

21:37.297 --> 21:38.929
since you like driving so much,

21:38.931 --> 21:40.831
you are now my personal
chauffeur until further notice.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.167
- No!
- ( Laughing ) Yes.

21:44.436 --> 21:47.972
There is no errand too small,
no trip too far.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.141
I might even have you take me
down to the end of the driveway

21:50.143 --> 21:51.409
just to get the newspaper.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.311
I don't know.

21:54.446 --> 21:55.980
That's right, girls.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.249
I just dropped
an atomic mom bomb.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.517
Boom!

22:05.157 --> 22:07.325
She can't be serious
about that, right?

22:07.327 --> 22:09.126
Do we seriously
still get newspapers

22:09.128 --> 22:11.362
delivered to our house?

22:11.364 --> 22:14.899
Hey, whatever you did down
at Neville's totally worked.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.535
Some fanboy named lone wolf
started a petition

22:17.537 --> 22:19.337
to get me the role of Tristan.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.572
You won over the fanboys.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.007
Thank you.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.544
Pretty sure lone wolf
is actually lone Joey.

22:28.146 --> 22:30.047
You should go thank him.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.515
Wait, I thought you
said that Joey

22:31.517 --> 22:33.317
was the one trying
to sabotage us.

22:33.319 --> 22:36.620
It was a long
and complicated day.

22:36.622 --> 22:39.123
Got it.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.460
Also I'm sorry about
wrecking your driver's test.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.529
Literally. Ha!

22:45.531 --> 22:47.565
And I got you something.

22:49.868 --> 22:53.337
You might want to return
this to the... hoovers.

22:54.973 --> 22:56.340
Thanks.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.641
That reminds me.

22:57.643 --> 23:00.311
I got you something as well.

23:00.313 --> 23:02.513
One of Artie's
wolf tails. Yeah.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.118
Oh! Also I got you
a date to the prom.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.487
( Laughs ) Yeah.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.922
Artie would like to know
what kind of dress

23:11.924 --> 23:15.426
you will be wearing...
wizard or Pegasus?

23:17.262 --> 23:18.329
( Mouths )

23:22.167 --> 23:24.435
Liv, you were absolutely right.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.437
It is mind-blowing
what I can accomplish

23:26.439 --> 23:28.406
from the passenger seat
of the car.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.508
I paid a bill,
ordered some cute tops,

23:30.510 --> 23:32.076
and adopted a penguin.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.613
- <i>( Phone chimes )</i>
<i>- Ooh! Incoming.</i>

23:35.615 --> 23:37.114
- <i>( Chimes )</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

23:37.116 --> 23:39.049
Aah!
( Laughing )

23:39.051 --> 23:41.252
That's funny.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.454
Maddie just sent me
the funniest photo.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.089
- You boys want to see it?
- Yeah. Yeah yeah.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.425
Okay, I'll send.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.226
<i>( Phone chimes,</i>
<i>makes springing noise )</i>

23:49.228 --> 23:52.329
( All laugh )

23:52.331 --> 23:54.465
That's classic!

23:54.467 --> 23:58.002
What is everybody laughing at?

23:58.004 --> 24:00.137
What are we looking at?
What's so funny?

24:00.139 --> 24:01.372
I hate driving!
