the format of this game

40:09.808 --> 40:11.608
is to avoid going down
to the Lair,

40:11.676 --> 40:13.943
and I understand
and accept that, at some stage,

40:14.012 --> 40:15.512
I will have to go down there,

40:15.580 --> 40:17.580
because, you know,
I do want to prove myself.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.316
However, I don't want
to go down tonight,

40:20.385 --> 40:21.518
and do you know--

40:21.586 --> 40:22.952
- Do you want to go
down any night?

40:23.021 --> 40:24.454
- [laughs]
No.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.990
- When can we pencil
you in, Big T?

40:27.058 --> 40:28.892
- Never.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.727
- So I know a lot of you guys

40:30.796 --> 40:32.796

with me.

40:32.864 --> 40:35.532
I'm somebody that
has always been loyal,

40:35.600 --> 40:37.834
and I've always ridden
with my friends.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.670
I think that all of you guys
know who I am

40:40.739 --> 40:42.806
and what I'm playing for,
and I'm a mom,

40:42.874 --> 40:45.208

on the line this season.

I don't think
it's my time to go in.

one of the weakest here,

40:54.453 --> 40:55.752
I may not be strongest,

40:55.821 --> 40:58.788
but, like, I were
into elimination last week,

40:58.857 --> 41:01.124

I've proved myself.

41:01.193 --> 41:02.325

41:02.394 --> 41:03.860
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you did.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.896

because I'm the weakest person,

41:06.965 --> 41:09.599

my, like, 100%.
