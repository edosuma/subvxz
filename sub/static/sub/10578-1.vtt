00:44.670 --> 00:48.265
Between the years
when the oceans drank Atlantis

00:48.340 --> 00:53.688
and the rise of the sons of Aryas,
there was an age undreamed of

00:54.304 --> 00:57.899
when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.813
Then came the dark empire of Acheron,

01:02.896 --> 01:06.491
where cruel Necromancers
sought secrets of resurrection.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.038
They crafted a mask from the bones of kings

01:11.113 --> 01:15.084
and awakened its wrath
with the pure blood of their daughters.

01:15.993 --> 01:19.372
The mask summoned spirits
of unspeakable evil,

01:19.454 --> 01:23.129
giving them power
no mortal men should possess.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.719
Acheron enslaved the civilized world.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.560
Only the Barbarian tribes
were left to rise up against them.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.781
The mask was shattered and Acheron fell.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.997
Each tribe kept a single shard

01:54.072 --> 01:57.622
so that no man might attempt
to join them back together

01:57.701 --> 02:02.081
and drive the world
once again into chaos and ruin.

02:03.498 --> 02:08.378
Their pieces were scattered across the land
and remained hidden for ages.

02:11.465 --> 02:16.187
But prophecy spoke of a man who would
some day try to reassemble the mask

02:16.261 --> 02:18.480
and rule the world.

02:20.140 --> 02:26.113
So came the dawn of Hyborian Age,
a time both bleak and brutal.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.945
And so came a child.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.611
Born of battle.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.600
Fialla!

03:05.769 --> 03:06.895
Fialla.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.944
Do not speak, my love. Do not speak.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.526
I must see my child before I die.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.493
Name your son.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.163
His name

04:02.826 --> 04:04.328
is Conan.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.736
Slow down, Conan!

05:31.998 --> 05:36.424
When a Cimmerian feels thirst,
it is the thirst for blood.

05:39.422 --> 05:43.643
When he feels cold,
it is the cold edge of steel.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.106
But the courage
of the Cimmerian is tempered.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.652
He neither fears death
nor rushes foolishly to meet it.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.697
But to be a Cimmerian warrior,

05:55.772 --> 06:00.323
you must have both cunning and
balance, as well as speed and strength.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.495
Conan.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.713
I gave you chores, boy.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.415
Finished, Father.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.842
First to circle the hills
and return the egg unbroken

06:22.924 --> 06:25.894
earns the right to fight with the warriors.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.367
Well, by Crom, boy,
what are you waiting for?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.549
We go back.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.219
Conan!

10:09.651 --> 10:11.369
Make way. Make way.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.818
Come. Time to forge a blade.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.718
This sword we make will be yours one day.

12:03.306 --> 12:07.607
But before you wield it,
you must understand it.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.942
The sword must bend or it will break.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.360
It must be tempered.

12:24.285 --> 12:28.540
What is most important
when forging a blade, fire or ice?

12:28.623 --> 12:29.715
Fire.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.341
Ice?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.297
Are you certain?

12:48.184 --> 12:52.064
Fire and ice together.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.904
This is the mystery of steel.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.879
You're still all fire, boy.

13:18.673 --> 13:22.723
No. Slow down. Find your footing.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.902
Enough!

13:45.408 --> 13:47.502
You're not ready for this sword.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.214
Fire!

16:56.599 --> 16:57.725
Fire!

17:22.625 --> 17:24.377
- Father!
- Conan!

17:35.388 --> 17:36.856
Father!

17:36.931 --> 17:37.978
Conan!

17:38.432 --> 17:39.604
Die!

17:42.728 --> 17:43.980
Father!

18:09.130 --> 18:10.473
Barbarian.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.352
There's no shame in kneeling before me.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.034
Each of these brave warriors

18:31.319 --> 18:34.949
has surrendered, left their lands,
sworn allegiance to me.

18:36.699 --> 18:40.124
They do so because
they know one day I will be a god.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.913
One day...

18:44.206 --> 18:49.053
the other clans of Cimmeria will gather
for vengeance, and then god or no god,

18:50.046 --> 18:51.389
you will fall.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.097
You know why I'm here.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.401
One piece is missing from the mask.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.235
You know its power. Give it to me now...

19:14.570 --> 19:17.744
or die and I'll find it for myself.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.170
I prefer death.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.425
Oh, my nose!

19:51.273 --> 19:52.320
No!

20:10.251 --> 20:11.298
This is your son.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.887
I like him.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.307
Come here, my daughter.

21:03.471 --> 21:07.351
Father, I sense the bone shard is close.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.186
Will you find it for me, Marique?

21:13.814 --> 21:16.112
Barbarian, your son has courage.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.367
But my daughter has talents as well.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.123
Find it, Marique.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.493
These Cimmerians, they do not pray.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.370
This is their church.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.713
This is what they worship.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.292
It will be here!

22:10.663 --> 22:13.917
The shard. She found the bone shard.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.689
Your mother would be proud.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.191
- Remo.
- Yeah?

22:39.275 --> 22:42.495
Gather the men. Burn everything.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.696
But, Zym!

22:43.779 --> 22:45.781
Not the boy. Not yet.

22:46.198 --> 22:50.078
Not yet. Look what he did to my face!

22:52.705 --> 22:55.800
Now, how do I punish you, huh?

22:57.459 --> 22:59.712
You fear not pain, nor death.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.319
Father! No!

23:25.279 --> 23:26.496
Father!

23:28.490 --> 23:29.537
No!

23:36.582 --> 23:38.334
Worse than death, eh, Cimmerian?

23:39.251 --> 23:40.798
Watching your son die.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.600
Because he loves you.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.627
It is complete.

24:14.203 --> 24:17.173
Marique, we're halfway there.

24:17.539 --> 24:21.043
When we find the pureblood, your mother,

24:22.127 --> 24:25.006
my beloved, will return.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.062
The mask is complete!

24:51.073 --> 24:54.327
Conan, you cannot save me.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.752
Let go of the chain, boy.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.597
- I'm not afraid to die!
- Nor I.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.350
I love you, Son.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.110
No! No!

26:36.178 --> 26:40.524
Conan left Cimmeria
and wandered the edges of the world,

26:40.599 --> 26:43.694
slaying, thieving, surviving,

26:44.353 --> 26:50.577
storming the high walls of Venarium
and prowling the dark seas among pirates.

26:51.235 --> 26:55.741
But the nameless man who slaughtered
his village and killed his father

26:56.281 --> 26:58.329
remained in shadow.

27:14.133 --> 27:18.513
These are common slavers, Conan.
Not the man you seek. Why attack?

27:18.595 --> 27:20.643
No man should live in chains.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.967
Fight!

28:27.414 --> 28:30.793
Stay and fight,
you pink-bellied motherless goat-lovers!

28:58.153 --> 28:59.826
Go. You're free.

29:03.575 --> 29:08.001
Go. Your masters are dead.
You are no longer slaves.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.675
But you've taken all our food,
all our weapons.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.803
Where would you have us go?

29:22.594 --> 29:23.937
Come on.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.855
We sail to Messantia.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.663
Come on.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.289
Call it.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.920
Come on, old man.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.228
I win!

30:21.194 --> 30:22.241
I still win.

30:27.909 --> 30:31.880
When I first met him,
he was no bigger than you.

30:32.914 --> 30:37.260
Just a scrawny little rat
picking pockets in Zamora.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.880
Even so,

30:40.422 --> 30:44.848
it was he who stole the Elephant's Heart

30:44.926 --> 30:47.224
and slew the sorcerer Yara.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.059
Come.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.530
Hey, mama. Need more mead.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.119
Who's next?

31:16.458 --> 31:21.089
Guards! There. And check there.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.589
Hey. Why are they looking for you?

31:56.665 --> 31:59.794
No. No, no, no. No, wait.
You don't understand.

32:03.505 --> 32:07.226
They'll be happy to take us both to prison
if you don't let go!

32:08.927 --> 32:10.474
Maybe I wanna go to prison.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.352
You take the one in the middle?

32:13.432 --> 32:14.433
Me?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.439
- You.
- I'll take him.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.161
I am your prisoner.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.880
You're calm for somebody
who's about to die.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.302
Move!

33:09.571 --> 33:11.414
Where's the captain?

33:12.908 --> 33:16.583
The hill ape can speak.
The captain is currently occupied.

33:21.166 --> 33:24.090
Don't worry. Everyone can get their chance.

33:39.643 --> 33:40.735
Hey!

33:46.107 --> 33:47.279
Stop him!

33:56.451 --> 33:57.828
Come here!

34:02.415 --> 34:04.042
Where is the captain of the guard?

34:04.125 --> 34:07.425
His door's sealed from within.
He can only open it for me.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.809
Guards! The door!

34:20.350 --> 34:21.693
All right.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.030
What?

34:36.032 --> 34:38.159
Guards! Guards!

34:57.304 --> 34:58.351
You remember me?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.648
Who are you?

35:01.016 --> 35:02.518
I'm the one who made you pretty.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.192
You can't do this! Do you know who I am?

35:27.500 --> 35:30.595
Where is the man who killed my father?

35:30.670 --> 35:33.048
You seek Khalar Zym?

35:37.093 --> 35:40.393
Zym. No.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.602
My people were slain by a common bandit,
not a king.

35:44.684 --> 35:48.814
He was a bandit then. He's a legend now.
A Shadow Lord.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.568
A Shadow Lord, huh?

35:55.820 --> 35:58.573
Speak. I will not kill you.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.118
You know the Forbidden Forest?

36:02.202 --> 36:05.081
Nothing there but dead bodies
and the animals who feed on them.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.963
Even as we speak,
Khalar leads his legions through the mist.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.378
More.

36:11.461 --> 36:12.508
Not good enough.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.474
Wait! The forest is large, I know.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.723
But as he returns to his stronghold
at Khor Kalba,

36:19.803 --> 36:22.727
he returns by way of the ravine at Shaipur.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.353
That's a perfect place for an ambush.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.810
What does Khalar want there?

36:26.893 --> 36:31.319
He's with his witch daughter.
They're searching for a young girl.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.570
A pureblood.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.492
Are you leading me into a trap?

36:34.567 --> 36:36.535
No. I wouldn't lie to you.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.489
He's mad.

36:39.364 --> 36:44.040
He's obsessed with Acheronian sorcery.
I hold no loyalty to him.

36:46.246 --> 36:50.752
Well, Northerner,
I've upheld my part of the deal.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.804
No!

36:58.883 --> 37:00.009
Yes.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.525
By Mitra, what are you doing?

37:10.353 --> 37:12.071
Toasting to our deal.

37:24.492 --> 37:25.914
Hey! Northerner!

37:25.994 --> 37:27.996
Hey, hey, wait for me!

37:29.080 --> 37:31.048
Oh, god!

37:31.124 --> 37:33.001
Prisoners of Messantia!

37:33.626 --> 37:37.051
The key to your freedom
sits in your captain's gut.

37:37.130 --> 37:40.976
You gave me your word!
You swore you'd spare my life!

37:41.050 --> 37:43.394
I said I would not kill you.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.639
Free yourselves.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.956
Northerner! My name is Ela-Shan.

38:03.031 --> 38:06.376
Perhaps you've heard that there is no lock
I cannot break or vault I cannot enter.

38:08.077 --> 38:11.251
If you are ever foolish enough
to pursue this man to Khor Kalba,

38:11.331 --> 38:14.084
come see me in Argalon
so I can talk you out of it.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.215
Ask anyone you meet there for Ela-Shan!

38:32.477 --> 38:35.196
What do you see in my future,
Master Fassir?

38:35.271 --> 38:37.490
It is unclear.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.656
I see a journey.

38:42.695 --> 38:47.792
A man crossing the sands.

38:49.536 --> 38:50.913
A knight?

38:53.248 --> 38:54.591
A warrior.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.586
Your paths will merge.

39:00.463 --> 39:04.218
He will take you home to your birthplace.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.476
Is that all that you see, Master?

39:24.529 --> 39:28.375
The pureblood is close.
I can taste her in the air.

40:01.441 --> 40:05.287
There'll be rioting in Messantia for days,
thanks to you.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.282
Khalar Zym.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.408
What?

40:10.491 --> 40:12.493
That's the name of the man
who killed my father.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.375
Zym?

40:15.413 --> 40:17.381
Do you know who that is?

40:17.790 --> 40:19.633
I am told he's the angel of death.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.921
I leave tonight to pursue him in Shaipur.

40:23.004 --> 40:26.099
We can sail as far as the bay
near the Shaipur Outpost.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.718
- You can wait for me there.
- Wait?

40:29.802 --> 40:32.646
I'm not your serving maid.
I will go with you.

40:33.056 --> 40:37.027
Not this time, Artus.
This is something I must do alone.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.509
Go to the temple. Go! Go!

41:56.180 --> 41:58.558
Protect the master. Go! Go!

42:27.086 --> 42:29.134
Tamara, come with me.

42:40.308 --> 42:41.355
Get into the carriage.

42:41.434 --> 42:42.981
No, I want to stay here
and defend our home.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.813
For the sake of your people,
you must leave this place

42:44.896 --> 42:46.773
and go to the monks in Hyrkania.
It is your duty.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.824
Do not hesitate and do not waver.

42:50.359 --> 42:51.736
I don't want to leave you.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.321
Do you trust me, Tamara?

42:53.404 --> 42:56.203
Yes. With my life. Everything I have.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.626
Then ask no more questions
and do as I say.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.084
Go!

43:03.498 --> 43:04.841
Let's go!

43:09.712 --> 43:11.510
Let none escape!

43:38.783 --> 43:40.080
Zym.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.783
Who are you?

44:26.706 --> 44:28.003
Where's Khalar?

44:30.251 --> 44:31.468
Who is Khalar?

44:40.178 --> 44:41.395
Hey!

45:07.830 --> 45:09.298
Come here!

45:51.958 --> 45:53.801
Come on.

46:49.849 --> 46:51.396
Step aside, Northerner.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.815
The woman is property of Khalar Zym.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.521
She is my property now.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.490
Well, you have no claim to her.

46:58.774 --> 47:01.118
No. But I have a claim to you.

47:01.193 --> 47:03.241
And what claim is that?

47:04.822 --> 47:06.119
Death.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.051
Who are you?

47:25.259 --> 47:28.638
When you fight a Cimmerian, even a boy,

47:29.680 --> 47:30.806
you best kill him.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.984
I killed hundreds of Cimmerians.

47:33.059 --> 47:35.733
Yes. An entire village.

47:38.856 --> 47:42.076
But I did not burn in my father's forge.

47:44.320 --> 47:48.120
Run from me and I will tear apart
the mountains to find you.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.333
I will follow you to hell.

48:01.170 --> 48:03.389
Woman! Come here.

48:05.674 --> 48:07.551
I said, come here.

48:12.515 --> 48:16.941
Which one of you is the pureblood?

48:21.232 --> 48:25.112
Whoever reveals her, gets to live.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.585
And you smell.

48:47.550 --> 48:51.896
Are you the one I seek?

48:52.346 --> 48:54.440
Could it be you?

49:11.991 --> 49:13.709
None of them are pure.

49:30.551 --> 49:33.179
You know who I've come for.

49:33.262 --> 49:35.811
Why suffer for it?

49:37.933 --> 49:40.812
None of the ancient bloodline remain.

49:40.895 --> 49:44.991
Well, if this is true,
tell me why have you and these monks

49:45.065 --> 49:48.365
chosen to hide here like vermin
for a thousand years?

49:48.444 --> 49:50.788
We live here in peace.

49:51.238 --> 49:55.084
We have no riches. We do not make war.

49:55.826 --> 49:57.453
We value life.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.372
You value life.

50:03.083 --> 50:05.882
Do you forget what happened
in the forests of Ophir?

50:07.213 --> 50:12.310
When all the nations of Hyboria
hunted a woman as if she were an animal?

50:14.345 --> 50:19.101
When both I and my daughter were forced
to watch Maliva, my innocent wife,

50:19.183 --> 50:21.902
be lashed to the wheel and set aflame?

50:31.111 --> 50:35.116
No. What you value is death.

50:36.951 --> 50:40.751
The monks here had no part in her death.

50:43.499 --> 50:45.422
Where is the pureblood?

50:57.179 --> 50:58.977
Not to fear, Father.

50:59.848 --> 51:02.351
He will tell me his secrets.

51:02.434 --> 51:04.778
They all tell me their secrets.

51:07.648 --> 51:10.868
Your vain pursuit for
the secrets of Acheron

51:11.986 --> 51:15.240
is a lust for power, not a love of life.

51:15.823 --> 51:18.747
Your innocent wife

51:18.826 --> 51:23.081
sought to enslave all of Hyboria
with her sorcery.

51:24.248 --> 51:26.717
She deserved to burn.

51:29.044 --> 51:32.514
You will never rule,

51:33.340 --> 51:37.516
and Maliva will never rise again!

51:39.555 --> 51:40.647
Die!

51:54.570 --> 51:56.618
My lord!

51:56.697 --> 51:59.701
Remo is searching for
the one that got away.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.044
She is the pureblood.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.800
Remo will capture her for me.

52:22.556 --> 52:23.933
Come here!

52:36.320 --> 52:37.572
Get off.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.079
My master said I would meet you.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.835
He said our paths would merge.

52:55.839 --> 52:57.261
You're the one Khalar Zym seeks.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.260
I know nothing about it.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.103
Those were his men chasing you.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.351
They attacked our monastery.

53:07.643 --> 53:10.772
So, will you escort me to Hyrkania?

53:15.526 --> 53:17.244
We will wait for Khalar.

53:17.319 --> 53:19.617
We? There is no we.

53:20.614 --> 53:22.787
I will go to Hyrkania
as my master instructed.

53:24.743 --> 53:27.462
I said, we will wait.

53:27.538 --> 53:30.462
I said, I will go to Hyrkania.

53:37.589 --> 53:38.841
Why must I be tied up?

53:38.924 --> 53:40.642
Keep quiet and do as you're told.

53:41.135 --> 53:43.638
What are you going to do with him?

53:47.433 --> 53:49.686
I will wait for him to awaken.

53:51.145 --> 53:53.022
I wanna look him in the eyes
when I kill him.

53:57.025 --> 53:58.072
Do you have a name?

53:58.819 --> 54:01.618
My name is Tamara Amaliat Jorvi Karushan.

54:04.616 --> 54:06.084
And yours is?

54:06.493 --> 54:07.915
Conan.

54:08.328 --> 54:09.329
Conan.

54:10.664 --> 54:11.756
That's it?

54:12.374 --> 54:13.671
How many names do I need?

54:21.800 --> 54:24.553
Why would you save me only to tie me up?

54:29.808 --> 54:31.902
Khalar's a hard man to find.

54:32.603 --> 54:35.777
If I possess you, he must come to me.

54:36.356 --> 54:39.485
Possess? I am not your property.

54:39.568 --> 54:40.615
Go to sleep.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.321
I take instruction from no man.

54:43.363 --> 54:46.333
I am a monk of the Order of Shaipur.

54:47.409 --> 54:49.787
My people have never been conquered
by anyone the likes of you

54:49.870 --> 54:50.871
and I'm not about to...

54:51.747 --> 54:53.044
Open.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.047
What?

54:56.794 --> 54:58.011
Quiet.

55:13.227 --> 55:16.948
Still no word from Remo and his scouts?

55:18.857 --> 55:24.955
They're gone. Remo will bring her here.
He has never disappointed me.

55:28.867 --> 55:31.336
The prize is near, Father.

55:31.995 --> 55:36.171
Soon you will have not only the mask,
but the blood to fill it.

55:40.212 --> 55:45.059
Marique, how your mother
yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.

55:47.302 --> 55:51.478
Imagine the secrets she will bring
back from the realm of the dead.

55:53.392 --> 55:59.320
And imagine how indomitable I will become
when she's once again by my side.

56:02.734 --> 56:03.986
Father...

56:05.362 --> 56:08.992
If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...

56:10.242 --> 56:12.210
It will not fail.

56:14.955 --> 56:16.707
If it does...

56:16.790 --> 56:18.212
It will not!

56:20.294 --> 56:22.592
Your mother will return to me.

56:24.715 --> 56:29.061
My powers are growing inside of me.

56:30.512 --> 56:33.311
My mother's blood flows through me.

56:34.641 --> 56:38.646
I can help you uncover
the secrets of Acheron,

56:39.062 --> 56:40.359
just as she did.

56:40.439 --> 56:43.443
I can have them all kneeling before you,

56:44.401 --> 56:46.995
just as I kneel before you now.

56:52.326 --> 56:55.330
My Marique, you are like your mother.

56:56.872 --> 56:59.000
In so many ways.

57:07.341 --> 57:09.594
But you are not her.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.603
Here. Drink.

57:22.356 --> 57:25.280
The truth this time.
Why does Khalar want you?

57:25.817 --> 57:29.617
I am a simple monk.
I am of no value to a warlord.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.118
She's lying!

57:34.284 --> 57:39.211
It's her blood. Her blood is special.
She's last of the bloodline of Acheron.

57:39.915 --> 57:40.962
Wait.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.044
Don't kill him yet.

57:48.465 --> 57:49.591
You are mistaken.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.644
That bloodline ended a thousand years ago.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.471
You lie, whore.

57:55.389 --> 57:57.187
You can kill him now.

57:57.766 --> 57:59.143
No, please.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.856
For her, I can get you a king's ransom.
It is true.

58:04.564 --> 58:08.410
Khalar has been searching
for a pureblood descendant for 20 years.

58:09.403 --> 58:10.655
Then we will wait for Khalar.

58:10.737 --> 58:13.661
No. He will not come this way.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.459
He will be in the
Shaipur Ravine waiting for me.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.496
I can show you.

58:18.578 --> 58:20.205
Yeah.

58:24.001 --> 58:25.093
Come.

58:39.141 --> 58:40.438
Come on!

59:03.665 --> 59:05.542
You see? I speak the truth.

59:07.252 --> 59:11.473
If you want, he will give your
weight in gold for this woman.

59:11.965 --> 59:16.220
I will arrange everything.
I will deliver the message.

59:16.845 --> 59:18.813
Yes, you will.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.067
Remo returns.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.281
What does it say?

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.706
"The Shaipur Outpost at midday."

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.132
"Come alone."

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:34.598
It's hers.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.317
You're bold, Northerner.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.609
I admire courage, even when it's foolish.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.539
Your reward.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.164
- I do not want your gold.
- No?

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:46.666
Then what?

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.623
I want your head.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.125
Yes, of course you do.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.679
Kill him.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.262
Then bring me the pureblood.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:15.815
Conan!

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:11.248
Come on!

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.478
Who are you?

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.606
You left me behind to watch my father die.

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:43.694
Cimmerian.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:51.373
That was your chance, boy.
You won't get another.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.254
Wouldn't your father be ashamed of you?

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:31.283
Yeah.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.159
Come on!

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:32.682
Huh? Boy?

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.487
Run!

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.149
No!

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.624
By Mitra, jump!

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.212
I had him.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.968
Artus, I had him.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:55.928
The gods are cruel.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:59.761
Blast the gods. This was not their doing.

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.564
It was I who failed.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.353
Are the tales they tell true?

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:12.657
Does he have eyes red as fire
and a hide of golden scales?

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:14.234
He is just a man.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.495
Then it is he who has failed.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:23.919
In fact, you may be the only man in Hyboria
to fight Khalar Zym and live.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.711
I need to go ashore and find him.

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:32.046
After I go,
you must take her some place safe.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.796
She saved my life.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.216
For that, she has my loyalty.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.304
Then she has mine as well.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.708
Charming man, your friend.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:06.627
Most men are born to mother's milk.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.752
His first taste was of his mother's blood.

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:11.629
He was battle born.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:14.544
So all he can do is kill?

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:17.972
Oh, no. He has the heart of a king,

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.721
the loyalty of a bloodhound.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.765
The Barbarians may be warriors,

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:27.850
but they do not sacrifice their children
or enslave their allies

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:30.731
like the priests and princes
of the civilized world.

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:33.571
As for his manners...

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:34.863
You look like a harlot.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:39.160
Yes. And apparently I'm the only woman
you've ever met who isn't one.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.159
Cimmerian women dress as warriors.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.497
Give her the leather and the armor.

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.295
I think he likes you.

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:31.045
Wake up! Wake up!

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:46.306
All hands on deck!

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.361
No!

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:49.616
How many Cimmerians died
at the edge of that blade?

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:54.996
Catch!

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.436
Not bad.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:22.754
Farewell, good friend.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.712
May you find what you seek, Conan.

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:53.744
It would seem our friend has
forgotten his map of the shoreline.

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:55.495
You should take it to him.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.918
And say goodbye.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.255
We set sail at dawn.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.428
Don't be late.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:14.761
You should go back to the ship.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.393
Do you ever wonder if our actions
serve some plan?

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.314
Some purpose spun by the gods?

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:27.440
Or are we all just doomed
to chaos and ruin?

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.993
I know not and I care not.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:37.538
I live, I love, I slay, and I am content.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.193
Goodbye.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.034
Conan!

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:26.828
The elusive one. Welcome.

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:31.963
You have made a mistake.
I am not the person you are looking for.

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.304
It is she.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:49.771
The pureblood descendent
of the Necromancers of Acheron.

01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:41.781
I'm looking for a thief.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.704
Argalon is a city of thieves.

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:47.662
I'm looking for a thief named Ela-Shan.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.288
Who are you to ask, Barbarian?

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:55.841
Stand down, you fools!

01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:06.219
Fast as Yezud, he will gut you like a fish.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.399
I owe this man my life.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:16.024
Well, Ela-Shan,
you will have your chance to repay it.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.531
Come.

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.210
This is madness.

01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:40.840
Breaking into Khalar Zym's fortress

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:43.513
is like reaching under a sleeping dragon
to steal her eggs.

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.216
Why go in?

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.143
There's a woman inside.

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:54.441
She must be really pretty.

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:15.789
My mother wore this gown
on her wedding day. It flatters you.

01:21:18.165 --> 01:21:19.792
I'm not your mother.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.303
No? But you will be.

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:27.717
Imagine that your body is a vessel.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.053
And your soul is the water that fills it.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:35.024
When your blood seeds the mask,
my father will empty you.

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:37.522
Then I welcome death.

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:41.606
Your death shall herald
a new age of Acheron.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:46.865
The spirits I raise
will melt flesh from the bones of kings.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.946
And my wife will make me a god,

01:21:49.029 --> 01:21:52.909
and we will cast all rivals
into oceans of blood.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:04.004
Please. I beg you one last time.
Do not do this. Let us turn back.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:10.308
Come on.

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:28.198
Did you know
I met your Barbarian when he was a boy?

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.121
That I took this sword from him?

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:36.293
I'm told Cimmerian steel
is sharper and harder than any other,

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.340
that when it cuts,
the pain is close to pleasure.

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:46.053
I know that will please you.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:57.306
That was the last gate.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:23:00.313
I told you, you see?
I told you I can get you in.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:49.987
You!

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:55.076
A feast for my sword.

01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:57.783
No! A feast for the Dweller!

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:10.508
Hey!

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:20.013
- Watch out!
- No! No!

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:44.750
Conan!

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:45.877
Conan, watch out!

01:24:57.884 --> 01:25:00.137
No! Hey!

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:04.771
Conan!

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.455
Oh, Shit!

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:32.966
- Get me out of here!
- Use a key!

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.139
- I can't! I dropped them!
- Then pick the lock!

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:36.385
With what?

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:46.559
Hey! Help me!

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:50.362
Careful! Be careful!

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:54.070
Drop!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.048
Hey! Hey!

01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:20.764
Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.599
Hey! Help me. Hey!

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:03.593
Get me out of here!

01:27:03.677 --> 01:27:05.270
I'm dying! I'm gonna die!

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.103
You scream like a woman.

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:19.527
I think it's this way.
Hey, hey, wait for me.

01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:40.264
Yeah, I think he's headed to Skull Cave.

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:42.682
I see no more locks down there.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.473
Your debt is paid.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.681
Farewell, my friend.

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:55.021
If you ever need me again,
you know where to find me!

01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:04.381
As a victorious Barbarian sword
once shattered the mask,

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:08.139
so shall a vanquished
Barbarian sword revive it.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.245
Pureblood.

01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:31.392
Behold

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:34.346
and despair

01:30:36.056 --> 01:30:37.683
your new master.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:50.195
Maliva!

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.622
My queen!

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:55.951
Hear my call!

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:23.250
Barbarian.

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:25.331
I don't like you any more.

01:32:57.655 --> 01:32:58.998
Jump to the ledge!

01:33:02.702 --> 01:33:05.046
Get up! Hide!

01:33:17.467 --> 01:33:18.810
That was your chance, Khalar.

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:20.057
And you won't get another.

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:00.309
I smell you.

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:24.583
Conan!

01:34:42.969 --> 01:34:44.971
Barbarian!

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:48.934
You're too late. She belongs to me!

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:46.582
Die!

01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:00.714
Get out! Tamara, run! Run!

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:31.203
I'm going to kill you
with your own father's blade.

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:43.719
You are not worthy of my father's sword.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.060
Come.

01:36:57.437 --> 01:36:59.189
Come on.

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:19.967
Get up.

01:37:57.789 --> 01:37:59.382
Go!

01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:02.467
Run!

01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:32.999
Barbarian! I'm coming for you!

01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:38.079
Tamara!

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.237
Maliva!

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:09.531
I summon you here.

01:39:16.993 --> 01:39:18.415
His witch possesses me.

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:20.292
I can't fight her.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:21.588
No!

01:39:22.748 --> 01:39:24.216
Drop me, Conan, please!

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:30.508
Once again, the little Cimmerian boy
is caught holding a chain.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:31.933
Let me go!

01:39:34.886 --> 01:39:36.012
Let me go!

01:39:41.058 --> 01:39:42.150
Boy.

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:44.979
There is no shame in kneeling before me.

01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:47.652
Conan, please!

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:49.450
She will live forever.

01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:51.118
Drop the chain.

01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:53.537
Let go of the chain, Conan.

01:39:53.613 --> 01:39:56.583
And let another die in your place?

01:39:58.242 --> 01:39:59.835
Like your father?

01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:02.462
Drop me!

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:06.793
I warned him that one day

01:40:07.502 --> 01:40:09.971
I would become a god.

01:40:16.344 --> 01:40:20.599
And my father warned you, god or not...

01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:24.143
Let me go!

01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:25.319
You will fall!

01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:35.535
Maliva!

01:40:59.011 --> 01:41:00.888
Give me your hand.

01:42:11.042 --> 01:42:12.760
Thank you for bringing me home.

01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:14.546
I know you have to leave.

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:15.721
Live well, Tamara.

01:42:17.548 --> 01:42:19.346
Till we meet again.

01:43:38.838 --> 01:43:41.637
This sword we make will be yours one day.

01:43:42.633 --> 01:43:47.480
But before you wield it,
you must understand it.
