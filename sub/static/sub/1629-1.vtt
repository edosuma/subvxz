wanna take a look around, kid.

It's the mother lode of magic.

Who works there?

03:10.191 --> 03:13.524
Who we work for
is not your concern, kid.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.860
Just know that they take care of us.

03:16.947 --> 03:17.936
Do they?

03:18.032 --> 03:21.365
Can they tell you how to get back home
after you destroy magic?

03:21.452 --> 03:23.488
We don't ask questions.

03:24.747 --> 03:26.112

03:45.601 --> 03:48.718
It's a good thing you guys
don't ask any questions.

Let's go.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.849

04:03.994 --> 04:06.030
Why are you slowing down?

04:06.122 --> 04:08.613

04:08.707 --> 04:10.959
Oh, I know, my hotheaded Queen.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.001

04:17.466 --> 04:21.300
Then we sail right through
and take him by surprise.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.344
The irony.

04:25.141 --> 04:26.130
What irony?

04:26.892 --> 04:30.601
Oh. I spent more time than I care
to remember trying to leave this place

04:30.688 --> 04:32.428
and to kill Rumplestiltskin.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.390
And here I am,
sailing right back into its heart

04:35.484 --> 04:37.896
with him as my guest of honor.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.312
It's not quite the happy ending
I was hoping for.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.617
Greg Mendell
said something funny to me.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.029
He said I'm a villain.

04:51.584 --> 04:54.542
And that villains
don't get happy endings.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.377
You believe that?

04:57.923 --> 04:59.379
I hope not.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.874
Or we've wasted our lives.

05:12.438 --> 05:13.473
Hey.

05:18.903 --> 05:23.112
What happened to Neal and Henry,

05:23.240 --> 05:24.571
it's not your fault.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.825
You can't blame yourself.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.402
I don't.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.113
I blame you.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.335
All of this happened
because I listened to you.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.255
You say good always wins? It doesn't.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.750
I didn't grow up in some fairy-tale land.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.633
My experience is different.
That's all I can go on.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.592
And all we have to go on is ours.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.553
So if you would just let us
share our wisdom...

05:55.648 --> 05:57.263
I appreciate you trying to be parents.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.107
But we're the same age.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.230
NOICE BREAKS) We have
equal amounts of wisdom.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.778
And all I want is Henry back.

06:06.784 --> 06:10.072
I should never have broken the curse.
I should havejust taken Henry, and...

06:10.162 --> 06:11.368
You're right.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.950
Then you'd be together.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.993
We missed you growing up, Emma.
And it haunts us every day.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.915
And that's why we're here now.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.497
We don't want you to have to
go through the same thing, too.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.842
And you won't.
We are gonna get our family back.

06:26.971 --> 06:30.134
How can you two
be so infuriatingly optimistic?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.760
It's who we are.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.840
VVhy?

06:34.353 --> 06:35.593
Ever since you got your memories back,

06:35.688 --> 06:39.055
ever since you remembered that you're
Snow White and Prince Charming,

06:39.149 --> 06:40.480
your lives have...

06:42.027 --> 06:43.107
Well, they've sucked.

06:43.195 --> 06:46.107
No. No, we found you.

06:46.198 --> 06:50.191
And lost Henry. And Neal.
And countless other people.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.363
Emma, the minute I let go of the belief
that things will get better

06:55.457 --> 06:58.199
is the minute I know they won't.

07:01.130 --> 07:02.165
We'll find Henry.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.329
GOLD: No, you won't.

07:05.009 --> 07:07.250
Oh, well, that's a great use of our time,

07:07.344 --> 07:08.880
a wardrobe change.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.216
I'm gonna get Henry.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.807
We agreed to do this together.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.509
Actually, we made no such agreement.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.977
Why are you doing this?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.474
Because I want to succeed.

07:20.566 --> 07:21.772
What makes you think I'm gonna fail?

07:21.859 --> 07:23.019
Well, how could you not?

07:23.819 --> 07:27.812
You don't believe in your parents.
Or in magic.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.316
Or even yourself.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.818
l slayed a dragon. I think I believe.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.991
Only what was shown to you.

07:34.330 --> 07:37.572
When have you ever taken
a real leap of faith?

07:37.708 --> 07:41.371
You know, the kind
where there's absolutely no proof.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.249
I've known you some time, Ms. Swan,

07:45.090 --> 07:47.422
and sadly, despite everything
you've been through,

07:47.551 --> 07:52.420
you're still just that bail bondsperson.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.592
Looking for evidence.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.057
Well, dearie,
that's not gonna work in Neverland.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.219
I'll do whatever it takes.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.606
Or you just need someone
to tell you what that is.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.733
Sorry, dearie.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.820
Our foe is too fearsome
for hand-holding.

08:09.907 --> 08:13.365
Neverland is a place
where imagination runs wild,

08:14.745 --> 08:16.030
and sadly,

08:17.039 --> 08:18.279
yours doesn't.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.268

08:42.439 --> 08:45.431
No. Building a signal.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.441
Help me gather some dry leaves.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.356
We need to let the home office
know that we're here.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.108
What if that's not enough?

08:52.241 --> 08:54.983
What if the empty communicator
wasn't an accident?

08:55.953 --> 08:58.615

09:16.849 --> 09:18.805
Welcome to Neverland.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.438
The home office is a bunch
of teenagers?

09:23.522 --> 09:26.764
They're not teenagers.
They're the Lost Boys.

09:26.859 --> 09:28.099
Look at that.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.809
Why do the Lost Boys
want to destroy magic?

09:30.946 --> 09:33.528
Who said we want to destroy magic?

09:33.657 --> 09:35.488
That was our mission.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.278
So you were told.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.358
Yes.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.282
Now, the boy.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.875
Hand him over.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.662
Not until you tell us the plan.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.456
For magic.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.707
For getting home.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.842
You're not getting home.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.806
Then you're not getting the boy.

to "get ready" for a fight.

This was his.

I didn't realize you were sentimental.

Look, I need your help.

Most crossings with my father
don't end well.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.384
It was touch and go.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.390
He spared my life. I owe him a debt.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.142
Well, I'm happy to collect.

28:12.233 --> 28:16.021
I'm looking for something he left here.
Magical item.

28:17.113 --> 28:21.527
Well, I'm very sorry to disappoint,
but I arrived shortly after the curse,

28:21.617 --> 28:25.280
the place was cleaned out.
Nothing of any value remains.

28:25.788 --> 28:27.653
No. Thieves and looters
would only take what they could see.

28:40.386 --> 28:45.551
What's magical of a knotted old cane?
Probably belonged to one of the looters.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.506
No. It belonged to him.

28:50.021 --> 28:53.809
See these markings?
He's keeping track of me growing.

28:58.821 --> 28:59.936

29:06.287 --> 29:09.029
l've handled that walking stick
a dozen times.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.239
Never released a cloaking spell before.

29:12.293 --> 29:13.783
My father enchanted objects so that

29:13.878 --> 29:16.915
what might be a useless piece of wood
in the hands of a looter

29:17.006 --> 29:18.212
would become magical in his.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.086
Or in the hands of his only son.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.042
Yeah, he called it blood magic.

29:23.971 --> 29:28.214
Might not always seem like it, but family
was important to dear old dad.

29:29.602 --> 29:30.637
So...

29:32.104 --> 29:33.480
What's in there?

I thought you said
you could outrun a storm.

This isn't a storm. It's bloody damnation.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.740
Why would you do this?

29:50.831 --> 29:52.492
You're going to blame me?

29:52.583 --> 29:54.244
You turned the mermaid into wood.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.872
I did something about it,
which is more than what you can say.

29:56.963 --> 30:01.423
Undo your spell.
Bring back the mermaid.

30:01.509 --> 30:02.715
And what? You'll win her over

30:02.802 --> 30:05.965
with your rainbow kisses
and unicorn stickers?

30:06.055 --> 30:08.296
Considering that your plan failed,
at least we can try.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.927
Such a naive princess!

30:11.018 --> 30:12.258

No. We're done for.

The dust doesn't work.

32:16.811 --> 32:18.802

you're welcome in Neverland

35:16.073 --> 35:17.734

35:17.866 --> 35:20.699
With one caveat.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.777
There's always something with him.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.283
If you're here for the boy,

35:26.542 --> 35:27.577
well,

35:29.295 --> 35:31.502

how many of you I take with me.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.948

We don't need to be friends.

to get Henry back is cooperation.
