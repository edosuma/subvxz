00:02.001 --> 00:03.378
Previously on Lost:

00:03.462 --> 00:05.505
Three points of a triangle.

00:05.589 --> 00:09.050
One here on the beach. Another,
Kate will position in the jungle

00:09.134 --> 00:11.344
roughly two kilometers in.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.222
And the third,
I'll take to high ground.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.812
Where are you? Where are you?

00:22.398 --> 00:26.484
Mayday! Mayday!
Anybody out there? Hello!

00:26.568 --> 00:29.862
We're survivors of the crash
of Oceanic flight 815.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.197
Please copy.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.911
John, tell me exactly
what happened.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.290
John? Locke!

00:41.417 --> 00:46.295
- It fell... the plane.
- Locke said you fell from a cliff.

00:46.422 --> 00:49.382
- It's because of the hatch.
- What hatch?

00:49.466 --> 00:52.135
John said not to tell.

00:53.637 --> 00:54.846
What'd Locke do?

00:54.930 --> 00:56.389
- Where's Shannon?
- Don't know.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.684
- Well, she's his sister...
- I don't know where she is!

01:22.499 --> 01:26.377
Jack. Where are you going?

01:26.503 --> 01:29.255
To find John Locke.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.329
Is there anything I can do for you?

02:09.086 --> 02:12.673
Sun said he wouldn't let
Jack take his leg.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.053
Didn't want him using up
the antibiotics.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.059
She said he knew
what was happening to him.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.061
That he was brave.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.409
This is a special security announcement.

02:40.536 --> 02:44.163
Heathrow Airport Authority
reminds traveling passengers...

03:07.271 --> 03:08.938
OK, Sayid.

03:09.064 --> 03:12.191
Eighteen hours in a holding cell
should be enough.

03:12.276 --> 03:16.028
Let's get to it, shall we? I'm
Melissa Cole from Central Intelligence.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.281
This is Robbie Hewitt from ASIS.

03:18.490 --> 03:22.785
- You're gonna do us a favor.
- A favor?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.705
Three hundred pounds
of C-4 explosives were stolen

03:25.789 --> 03:27.832
from an army base outside Melbourne.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.251
The men responsible are a terrorist cell

03:30.335 --> 03:34.213
intent on disrupting
the coalition presence in Iraq.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.382
Three hundred pounds of C-4.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.508
I want it back.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.052
You're the CIA.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.054
- Plant a few bugs.
- Oh, we have.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.683
- You're gonna get inside first...
- I am Iraqi.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.518
I am not a terrorist.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.521
We didn't snatch you up
because you were a terrorist.

03:50.606 --> 03:53.190
We snatched you up
because you know one.

03:56.111 --> 04:00.573
Essam Tazir. Your roommate
at Cairo University.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.743
- He's a member of the cell.
- And why should I care?

04:03.827 --> 04:06.495
- You'd be saving lives.
- Why should I care?

04:06.580 --> 04:07.997
We know where she is.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.337
Seven years since you left Iraq.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.672
Six months here,
three months there.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.423
Always moving.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.344
There's only two reasons
why a man would do that.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.763
Either he's running away
from something,

04:23.847 --> 04:25.514
or looking for something.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.269
Noor Abed Jaseem.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.403
Nobody calls her Noor.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.364
You want to know where she is?

04:43.867 --> 04:45.952
Then we're going to Sydney.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.945
Kate, what are you doing out here?

05:21.029 --> 05:25.074
- Looking for you.
- Well, you found me.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.829
You're walking in circles.
You need to come back.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.080
Not without Locke.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.834
- You haven't slept, gave Boone blood...
- Locke lied.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.086
- Well, now you're...
- He lied, Kate.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.174
Boone did not fall off any cliff.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.342
His leg was crushed.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.846
And I based my
medical treatment on his lie.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.393
People are scared and upset.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.229
They don't know what's going on.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.107
We need you to come back, Jack.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.942
Please?

07:17.896 --> 07:19.855
Shannon.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.941
Do you wanna...?

07:23.068 --> 07:24.443
Wanna say something?

07:28.031 --> 07:29.031
No.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.795
I didn't know Boone very well,

07:42.879 --> 07:45.381
and for that I'm sorry.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.512
On our sixth day here,

07:51.596 --> 07:53.848
a woman named Joanna died.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.057
She drowned.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.644
And Boone was the first one
into the water.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.815
I didn't know him...

08:04.484 --> 08:07.403
...but I'll remember his courage...

08:07.487 --> 08:09.947
...and I know he will be missed.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.580
It was my fault.

08:22.085 --> 08:26.714
We found a plane,
a Beechcraft, in the jungle.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.466
It was lodged in the canopy.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.014
I would have gone up, but...

08:40.437 --> 08:43.188
My leg was hurt, so he...

08:49.279 --> 08:53.616
There was a radio inside,
and he thought he could...

09:00.624 --> 09:03.918
His weight must have made
the plane shift and it fell and...

09:08.757 --> 09:11.133
Happened because
he was trying to help us.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.804
He was a hero.

09:22.896 --> 09:28.150
Where were you?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.403
Where the hell were you,
you son of a bitch?

09:31.488 --> 09:34.240
- What did you do to him?
- Wait! Jack, stop!

09:34.324 --> 09:36.659
- What did you do?
- Wait!

09:36.743 --> 09:38.244
Where were you?

09:38.328 --> 09:42.164
You just left him to die.
You lied to me!

09:42.249 --> 09:43.332
Where were you?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.227
- Jack, it's OK.
- Where were you?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.360
Jack, what's the matter?
Are you OK?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.611
Oh, God.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.822
Get some water!

10:16.491 --> 10:18.617
Breathe. He's OK.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.161
Just breathe.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.418
- He's lying.
- You're suffering from fatigue.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.838
- Locke told Boone not to tell.
- Not to tell about what?

10:30.922 --> 10:34.967
Something about a hatch.
Locke's hiding something.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.594
- Jack, listen...
- The man is hiding something.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.887
Listen to me.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.849
We need the one doctor
on this island to get some sleep.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.518
- I'm fine. I don't need it.
- Jack.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.562
You need some rest.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.647
Come on.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.149
Sayid?

11:34.736 --> 11:37.196
- It is you.
- Essam.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.365
So you haven't forgotten me.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.160
Hardly.

11:44.454 --> 11:48.040
- What are you doing in Sydney?
- I've been traveling. And you?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.667
I live here.
Almost a year now.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.963
- I'm a tree cutter. I cut trees.
- Sounds like good, honest work.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.924
So much for my philosophy degree.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.884
Whatever puts food on your table.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.594
How is Zahraa?

12:03.098 --> 12:04.390
She died.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.896
A stray bomb, while she
was shopping for a dress.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.191
I'm so sorry.

12:15.777 --> 12:18.404
Listen, we've got
a lot of catching up to do.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.322
Why don't you come over?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.826
I'd love to.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.998
Damn it. I'm out of ammo.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.876
- Use the crowbar.
- That only works on the zombies.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.087
- Not the big bugs.
- Indeed.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.672
The three of you live here?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.675
Sydney's very expensive.
It's the best we can afford.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.052
And what is it you do?

12:42.929 --> 12:47.182
- At the moment, I'm at liberty.
- He's on holiday.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.143
You'll love the beaches here.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.979
There is something to be said
for Australian women.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.946
I've had the misfortune of being
landlocked for several years.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.991
The last beach I was at
was Sharm El Sheikh

13:04.075 --> 13:05.868
with you, Essam, remember?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.870
Before our English exams?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.747
I hear the beaches here are very nice.

13:13.418 --> 13:17.796
Especially the women.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.089
Perhaps we can go.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.975
Tell me, exactly
what kind of trees do you cut?

13:35.482 --> 13:38.901
- Who are you?
- I was a communications officer.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.487
Sayid was Republican Guard.
He knows things.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.120
Perhaps it's not happenstance

13:50.246 --> 13:52.372
that you and Essam met at the mosque.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.714
Perhaps it is fate.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.055
It's OK.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.682
Look, I'm fine. Really. OK?

14:10.767 --> 14:13.227
You need rest, Claire.
Sun, tell her.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.771
In a hospital,
they would have you sleep.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.689
The nurses would take your baby.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.149
But I'm not in a hospital.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.986
All the more reason
to take extra care, Claire.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.322
I can take care of
Turnip-Head for a while.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.823
Turnip-Head?

14:26.950 --> 14:29.493
It's what I'm calling him
till you give him a name.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.454
'Cause his head looks like a turnip.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.123
What if he needs something, OK?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.042
You'll be there after you sleep.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.794
No.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.801
Claire, no one is going to take
this baby away from you.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.554
You don't know that.
You can't say that.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.430
I won't let it happen.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.063
Just be really careful, OK?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.524
If he gets hot,
take his blanket off.

15:00.608 --> 15:04.069
- His neck. Around his neck.
- I got him.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.542
This was his.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.839
I didn't go through it.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.428
Thank you.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.846
You're welcome.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.356
Storm coming.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.406
I should have said no.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.910
First time he offered to hunt with me,
I should have said no.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.332
He would've gone anyway.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.169
Yeah, I suppose he would've.

16:08.259 --> 16:11.511
I know how confused and angry
you must be right now.

16:11.596 --> 16:15.265
I can't say I understand
what you're going through, but...

16:16.142 --> 16:19.019
...I know what it feels like
when you lose family.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.074
I hope you can forgive me.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.580
I'm sorry.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.688
You asked if you could
do anything for me.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.569
Anything.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.156
John Locke killed my brother.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.327
Will you do something about that?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.801
- A little more.
- No.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.513
- You need your blood sugar level up.
- Enough already. I've rested.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.932
- Jack...
- I'm fine.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.684
Where are you going?

17:42.019 --> 17:44.479
- I'm gonna talk to Locke.
- You need to lie down.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.733
- No, I don't.
- I strongly advise it.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.485
You advise? Advice?

17:50.570 --> 17:53.071
What...?
All right, what's going on now?

17:53.156 --> 17:55.907
Lie down. OK?

17:58.745 --> 18:03.498
I crushed up some sleeping pills,
put 'em in your juice.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.794
Why would you...? You drugged me?

18:08.713 --> 18:10.005
Yeah.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.678
OK.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.608
'Night.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.803
How did you get that?

19:02.725 --> 19:04.601
War wound.

19:04.727 --> 19:08.897
- Looks more like a surgical scar.
- Like I said, war wound.

19:11.234 --> 19:15.320
The plane's radio.
Was Boone able to pick up a signal?

19:15.404 --> 19:18.156
I was on the ground.
All I could hear was static.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.659
- So it was working.
- Yeah.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.036
But I can't imagine
it survived the fall.

19:24.997 --> 19:29.084
Some of its parts might work in the
transmitter I'm building for the raft...

19:31.087 --> 19:32.921
...if you'd be willing to take me.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.258
Of course.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.763
- How did you find this plane?
- Luck.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.306
You and Boone were hunting?

19:43.391 --> 19:47.143
- That a question?
- Yes.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.480
Boar got scarce a couple weeks back.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.691
We weren't hunting,
we were exploring.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.986
So you just happened upon
a Beechcraft perched in the trees?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.445
Yep.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.658
At the funeral, you said
your leg was injured.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.119
It was just a charley horse.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.704
A cramp.

20:05.788 --> 20:08.790
I know what
a charley horse is, John.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.378
Back in Iraq,
you were an interrogator?

20:14.213 --> 20:17.257
- Is that a question?
- Yeah.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.468
A long time ago, I was.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.721
Well, you haven't lost your touch.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.140
Why would I interrogate you, John?

20:27.059 --> 20:30.854
Jack called me a liar in front of
every man, woman and child

20:30.980 --> 20:33.315
I've come to know
over the past month.

20:33.399 --> 20:37.277
There's a part of you that thinks
maybe there isn't a plane here at all.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.697
I know when I'm being lied to.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.782
There's a plane.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.342
Like I said,
you haven't lost your touch.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.306
You've lost your edge, old man.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.100
I never had one when I played you.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.602
Were you always this slow?

21:10.686 --> 21:11.895
Come on, let's play.

21:11.979 --> 21:15.523
You have to get out of that apartment.
Practice more.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.943
Haddad would like that.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.111
More blending in with the community.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.988
He's got his eye on a target.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.240
What makes you say that?

21:24.325 --> 21:27.243
For two weeks, he's been
asking me about explosives.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.121
Blast radius. Transport.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.957
Haddad's very thorough.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.084
Has he gotten hold of any yet?

21:34.168 --> 21:38.421
Explosives? I don't know.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.174
All I know is there's going
to be an operation...

21:41.884 --> 21:43.969
...and there is going to be a martyr.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.223
You?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.976
Haddad told me this morning.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.108
Come on, let's keep playing.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.694
- Essam.
- I'm going to wipe the floor with you.

22:00.778 --> 22:04.280
What is it?

22:07.368 --> 22:09.869
I don't think I can do it.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.999
- You're kidding me, right?
- Listen to me.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.917
I can get Essam to turn himself in.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.504
- Does he know where the C-4 is?
- The other two are the ones you want.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.674
- Essam's confused...
- Does he know where it is?

22:22.758 --> 22:25.677
- No.
- Then he's useless.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.471
These cells run top down.
It's all need-to-know.

22:28.556 --> 22:32.434
The recruit's handed a bomb and a target
at the last possible moment.

22:32.518 --> 22:36.521
The way to find the C-4 is wait for
Essam to walk out with a target to hit.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.940
He's in over his head,
doesn't know why...

22:39.025 --> 22:41.985
That's why you convince him
to go through with it.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.198
No. I will not.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.285
- Excuse me?
- I'm done. It's over.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.787
You're not close
to being done, my friend.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.582
- What are you going to do, arrest me?
- No.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.543
We'll arrest her.

22:59.211 --> 23:03.173
Your girlfriend's an Iraqi living abroad
with a record of insurgency.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.595
Wouldn't it be terrible if she
got picked up as an enemy combatant?

23:09.930 --> 23:12.891
So, if you want any chance
of ever seeing her again,

23:12.975 --> 23:15.226
go and talk your good friend Essam

23:15.311 --> 23:17.353
into blowing himself up.

23:22.193 --> 23:27.072
The itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the spout

23:27.156 --> 23:31.785
Down came the rain
and drowned the spider out

23:31.869 --> 23:34.245
- When the...
- Dude, it's "washed."

23:34.330 --> 23:36.748
"Washed the spider out."

23:36.832 --> 23:39.334
Unless there's some
kind of British version.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.502
OK.

23:42.046 --> 23:45.340
Down came the rain
and washed the spider...

23:45.424 --> 23:48.760
- Oh, bollocks.
- What's the matter, man?

23:48.844 --> 23:51.221
I can't get the bloody thing
to stop crying.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.430
Maybe he's hungry.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.849
No. Claire nursed him five times.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.811
He make any deposits,
you know, diaper-wise?

24:03.943 --> 24:04.984
All right...

24:06.529 --> 24:08.822
...time to break out the big guns.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.557
Dude, that's all I got.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.233
Heroin.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.152
Cargo hold is full of it.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.821
Best I can figure, they were smugglers.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.077
The plane was perched in the canopy?

24:56.579 --> 24:57.912
Right up there.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.750
And Boone climbed up by himself,
because of your charley horse.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.170
Yes. That's right.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.089
Why did you lie?

25:12.136 --> 25:13.678
I made a mistake.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.435
I'm going to salvage
what I can of the radio.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.688
If we leave now, we should
beat the storm back.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.114
Why don't you trust me, Sayid?

25:36.118 --> 25:37.160
For one thing...

25:38.454 --> 25:41.539
...you've been carrying a gun
you've told no one about.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.712
We found one of the smugglers
about half a click west of here

25:47.796 --> 25:51.090
dressed as a priest,
Nigerian currency in his pockets.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.634
And this.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.100
Now you're armed and I'm not.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.853
Does that earn me any trust?

26:03.938 --> 26:07.523
You gave this to me
because I caught you concealing it.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.776
That earns you adaptability.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.489
I'll tell you something you don't know.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.324
Please do.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.328
A week after the crash,
there was a cave-in.

26:20.496 --> 26:23.206
- Jack was trapped. Remember?
- Of course.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.291
You, Kate and Sawyer

26:25.376 --> 26:28.628
went out into the jungle
to triangulate a signal.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.840
You were hit, knocked unconscious.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.594
When you woke up, the transceiver,
your equipment was destroyed.

26:43.185 --> 26:45.186
That was me.

26:53.696 --> 26:56.197
This time you better
not be telling the truth.

26:56.282 --> 27:00.118
- It was in everyone's interest.
- Ruined my chance to find the source...

27:00.202 --> 27:04.038
Of a distress call saying,
"They're dead. It killed 'em all."

27:04.123 --> 27:07.500
Is that a place you really want
to lead people to?

27:10.212 --> 27:13.631
Why wait all this time?
Why not tell me then?

27:13.716 --> 27:17.468
Because back then you wouldn't have
engaged in a reasonable debate.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.805
Nobody else would. You were
so focused to get off the island

27:20.889 --> 27:24.976
you weren't seeing things clearly,
like what's happening with the raft.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.522
- Did you burn the raft?
- No, I didn't.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.403
What is the hatch?

27:36.655 --> 27:37.655
The hatch?

27:37.740 --> 27:40.283
Boone mentioned it before he died.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.244
The hatch?

27:47.916 --> 27:53.421
Two hatches on a plane.
Could be forward... or aft.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.515
I'm not sure if I can do this.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.561
You wouldn't be a martyr if you
didn't have to overcome fear...

28:08.645 --> 28:09.937
I'm not afraid to die.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.983
It's all the innocent lives,
all those people.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.527
The imam preaches peace, Sayid,

28:16.612 --> 28:19.197
that every human life is sacred.

28:19.281 --> 28:23.201
It's true. Innocent lives will be lost
In service of a greater good.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.953
What if I'm doing this
because I'm angry?

28:27.456 --> 28:29.791
Because they killed her?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.584
What if you are?

28:39.176 --> 28:42.887
Should we just accept
what happened to Zahraa?

28:42.971 --> 28:46.099
What about others like her?
We just accept their deaths?

28:46.183 --> 28:50.561
Because if we do, it means
ultimately we care nothing about them.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.779
I lost someone, too, Essam.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.534
I will never be whole again.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.246
There need to be consequences
for those responsible.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.167
That's my duty, how I will honor her.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.715
Haddad was right.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.345
It was fate that
brought us back together.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.309
Sayid...

29:32.354 --> 29:34.605
...will you do this with me?

29:36.859 --> 29:38.860
I will.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.886
How are you?

30:08.515 --> 30:11.893
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Sure.

30:14.188 --> 30:16.230
- I spoke to Locke.
- What did he say?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.774
He took me to the plane.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.736
I believe what happened
was an accident.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.696
Then why did he lie?

30:25.073 --> 30:27.658
I have no idea.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.411
But I don't believe
he meant to harm Boone.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.039
So that's it?

30:33.707 --> 30:36.959
I know how strong the need
can be to find someone to blame...

30:37.044 --> 30:38.920
You don't get it, do you?

30:40.047 --> 30:43.591
- Shannon.
- Just forget about it, OK?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.310
How much weight can this hold?

30:55.646 --> 30:57.021
I don't know.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.690
A lot. Enough.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.445
Yeah. Tighter. Got it.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.698
- What if it tips over?
- It won't.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.451
That's why we made it this wide.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.954
There, that should do it.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.122
Right? Good?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.209
Good.

31:19.461 --> 31:22.547
- All right.
- What if a shark attacks?

31:23.507 --> 31:25.967
Sharks ain't getting
anywhere near us, man.

31:28.637 --> 31:29.720
What if we die?

31:35.185 --> 31:37.103
We are not gonna die.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.690
Boone died.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.528
Michael, do you know
anything about babies?

31:45.654 --> 31:47.363
I can't get this guy to be quiet.

31:47.447 --> 31:51.117
- Walk with him. He'll calm down.
- I tried that.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.661
Jin, have you seen Sun?

31:54.621 --> 31:57.206
I need some help with this baby.

31:57.291 --> 32:00.418
- No.
- OK.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.590
Chucky, you wanna keep that kid quiet?

32:05.674 --> 32:08.676
Baby Huey's like nails on a chalkboard.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.972
There you go. You happy now?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.020
I was.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.690
If you're gonna play nursemaid
at least do the damn job.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.066
Say something else.

32:25.652 --> 32:29.530
- Just say something, anything.
- Fine.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.950
I liked that thing a lot better
inside than outside.

32:38.707 --> 32:39.915
What?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.608
Brought you something to eat.

33:05.692 --> 33:10.071
- What's in it? Chloroform?
- Soup.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.823
Thanks, but I think I'll...

33:16.995 --> 33:19.997
- Who was in here?
- I don't know. What's the matter?

33:20.082 --> 33:22.667
- Was anybody in here?
- No, why are you...?

33:22.751 --> 33:25.920
The key to the gun case.
It's gone.

33:26.922 --> 33:29.423
- Maybe it fell off this morning.
- It didn't.

33:31.385 --> 33:32.843
What's going on?

33:32.928 --> 33:35.429
Locke took the key. He's after the guns.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.682
I haven't seen him. You don't know...

33:37.766 --> 33:39.266
No? Then who was it?

33:39.351 --> 33:40.476
Jack.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.941
It wasn't Locke.

34:09.339 --> 34:10.672
Get in.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.225
It's time.

34:43.956 --> 34:47.293
Stay relaxed and focused.
Drive with the windows down.

34:47.377 --> 34:50.087
The fresh air will keep you alert.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.175
You will need to wear these.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.805
If you run into any problems...

35:03.268 --> 35:04.351
...use this.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.439
You are heroes.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.651
Good luck.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.550
Essam, stop.

35:37.761 --> 35:40.971
Don't be nervous, brother.
We'll be OK.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.765
I'm working with the CIA.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.185
What?

35:46.311 --> 35:49.772
I'm going to give you ten minutes
to get away before I call them.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.275
- You set me up?
- Essam, just go.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.778
- Why would you do this?
- You're wasting time.

35:55.862 --> 35:59.323
We were going to do this together.
You lost someone.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.119
Her name is Nadia.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.622
We were separated years ago.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.626
They know where I can find her.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.673
You used me to find a woman?

36:28.979 --> 36:31.856
- You talked me into this.
- Essam, don't.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.650
- For the greater good.
- I'm begging you to go.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.862
Said you were my brother.
You're supposed to be my friend!

36:37.946 --> 36:39.822
I am your friend.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.116
Who told me to do this for Zahraa,

36:42.200 --> 36:45.661
just so you could find
some woman that you love?

36:53.753 --> 36:58.799
Well, Sayid, I hope
she makes you whole again.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.273
Go!

37:29.831 --> 37:31.916
She doesn't believe me, Sayid.

37:37.589 --> 37:42.426
- Please listen to me.
- He did it. I know it.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.720
You're not thinking rationally.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.768
You've never fired a gun...

37:54.314 --> 37:56.649
- You don't want to do this.
- Yes, I do.

37:56.733 --> 38:00.361
If you do it,
you can never take it back.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.909
Stay back!

38:10.747 --> 38:12.539
What did you do to him?

38:13.416 --> 38:15.084
I told you it was an accident.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.462
Jack, you told me he was a liar.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.977
No!

38:42.904 --> 38:44.905
- I'm sorry.
- Don't.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.701
- Get away.
- Shannon.

39:17.731 --> 39:20.024
"The low rumble
breaks the crisp fall air

39:20.108 --> 39:24.361
as a flash of red streaks down
the maple-dappled Vermont highway.

39:26.740 --> 39:30.451
The 32-valve V8 engine purrs
as the transmission clicks down a gear

39:30.577 --> 39:32.619
and the vehicle
unleashes 400 horses

39:32.704 --> 39:36.707
and 350 pound/feet
of rear-wheel torque."

39:40.295 --> 39:41.920
Keep going.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.840
Charlie...

39:44.924 --> 39:47.718
"Beneath the hood,
the 4.4-liter power plant

39:47.802 --> 39:51.889
features an integrated supercharger
mated to a six-speed transmission

39:51.973 --> 39:54.516
with a manual
sequential shift feature."

39:56.061 --> 39:58.562
Keep going.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.190
"This smooth-riding sports car

40:01.274 --> 40:05.319
offers a bewitching blend of pace,
comfort and economy."

40:22.170 --> 40:23.712
She just needs time.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.839
She's been through a lot.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.176
Time won't make a difference.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.057
Perhaps I made a mistake.

40:35.809 --> 40:39.269
You couldn't let her kill Locke.
You had no choice.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.273
There's always a choice.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.614
She lives in Irvine, California,
just south of Los Angeles.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.200
Works as a lab tech
in a medical testing company.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.869
Plane ticket.
Walking around money.

40:55.995 --> 40:59.957
You're on an Oceanic flight to LA.
It leaves in two hours.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.126
What happens to his body?

41:02.210 --> 41:05.796
He was a terrorist, so he's not
exactly getting a state funeral.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.132
What happens to his body?

41:13.054 --> 41:16.014
After it's released, he'll be cremated.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.183
A Muslim man
is supposed to be buried.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.811
Yeah? Well, there's
no one to claim the body.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.146
I'll claim him.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.481
You can't claim him
on a plane in two hours.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.067
Then change my flight to tomorrow.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.419
How's your head?

41:47.380 --> 41:50.841
- It'll heal.
- Another war wound.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.137
I know what it cost you...

41:57.098 --> 41:58.765
...to do what you did.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.268
Thank you.

42:03.646 --> 42:06.023
I did it because I sense

42:06.107 --> 42:08.567
you might be our best hope
of surviving here.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.864
But I don't forgive what you did,

42:13.948 --> 42:15.741
and I certainly don't trust you.

42:17.619 --> 42:21.079
And now, you're going
to take me to the hatch.

42:22.123 --> 42:25.584
- Hatch? I already showed you...
- John.

42:27.003 --> 42:28.837
No more lies.
