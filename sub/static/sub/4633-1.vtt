00:37.500 --> 00:41.000
There were two loves in his life.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
His engine,

00:43.500 --> 00:46.000
And ---

02:51.250 --> 02:53.500
'Fort Sumter has been fired upon.'

02:56.500 --> 02:59.000
'Then the war is here.'

03:01.500 --> 03:07.500
'Yes, dad, and I'm going to be 
one of the first to enlist.'

03:34.500 --> 03:37.000
'Aren't you going to enlist?'

04:29.500 --> 04:30.750
'Your name?'

04:37.500 --> 04:38.900
'Occupation?'

04:41.250 --> 04:44.000
'Engineer on the Western and 
Atlantic Railroad.'

04:59.250 --> 05:05.750
'Don't enlist him. He is more 
valuable to the South as an engineer.'

05:12.250 --> 05:14.500
'We can't use you.'

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
'Occupation?'

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
'Bartender.'

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
'If you lose this war
don't blame me.'

08:13.500 --> 08:15.250
'Did Johnnie enlist?'

08:20.000 --> 08:22.500
'He didn't even get in line.'

08:29.250 --> 08:32.250
'He's a disgrace to the South.'

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
'Why didn't you enlist?'

09:01.000 --> 09:03.250
'They wouldn't take me.'

09:08.750 --> 09:17.000
'Please don't lie -- I don't want
you to speak to me again until
you are in uniform.'

09:45.250 --> 09:51.250
A year later. In a Union encampment 
just North of Chattanooga.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
General Thatcher, and his chief
spy, Captain Anderson.

10:07.250 --> 10:16.750
'I know every foot of this railroad
from Marietta to Chattanooga -- and
with ten picked men I cannot fail.'

10:22.250 --> 10:30.750
'We will enter the South as civilians coming 
from the neutral state of Kentucky to
join the Southern cause.' 

10:36.250 --> 10:42.750
'At Big Shanty we will steal the 
train while the passengers and 
crew are at dinner, and proceeding '...

10:43.000 --> 10:53.750
...' North we will burn every bridge, 
cutting off the supplies of the
army now facing you.'

11:03.250 --> 11:10.750
'Then the day you steal the train
I will have General Parker
advance to meet you.' 

11:27.250 --> 11:33.750
'As soon as I arrive I will let
you know how seriously father
is wounded.'

12:07.250 --> 12:09.750
'Big Shanty. Twenty minutes 
for dinner.'

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
'Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters.'

18:00.250 --> 18:03.000
'Why not stop and fight them?'

18:06.250 --> 18:10.250
'I'm afraid they have us 
greatly outnumbered.'

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
The Southern army facing 
Chattanooga is ordered to 
retreat.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
General Parker's victorious 
Nothern army advancing.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
'There is only one man on that engine.'

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
In the enemy's country --
hopelessly lost, helplessly 
cold and horribly hungry.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
'At nine o'clock tomorrow
morning our supply trains will
meet and unite with General '... 

32:09.250 --> 32:13.000
...' Parker's army at the Rock River
bridge.'

32:16.000 --> 32:25.834
'Then the army, backed by our supply 
trains, will advance for a surprise 
attack on the rebel's left flank.'

32:29.000 --> 32:36.000
'Once our trains and troops cross
that bridge, nothing on earth can
stop us.'

32:17.000 --> 32:26.750
'This girl was in the baggage 
car when we stole the train, so 
I thought it best to hold her.'

38:48.000 --> 38:55.000
'We had better stay here until 
daybreak to see where we are.'

39:00.000 --> 39:09.000
'It was so brave of you to risk
your life, coming into the enemy's
country, just to save me.'

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
After a nice, quiet, refreshing 
night's rest.

40:43.000 --> 40:51.000
'We've got to get back to our
lines somehow and warn them of 
this coming attack.'

43:59.000 --> 44:07.750
'I will get that spy BEFORE he reaches 
the Southern lines. You follow 
with the supply trains as planned.'

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
'We must pick up more firewood.'

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
The Rock River bridge

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
The Northern division nearing 
the bridge to meet the supply trains

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:05.000
'That bridge is not burned enough
to stop you, and my men will 
ford the river.'

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Heroes of the day.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
'Is that your uniform?'

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
'I had to wear it to get 
through the lines.'

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
'Take it off!'

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
'Enlist the Lieutenant.'

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:07.250
'Occupation?'

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
'Soldier.'
