[knocking at door]

00:17.200 --> 00:18.500
- Come in.

00:20.633 --> 00:22.733
- About what you said earlier,

00:22.800 --> 00:25.600
the whole dating
a 40-something guy

00:25.667 --> 00:27.767
in publishing.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.267
- I--
- I'm sorry.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.467
- Can you--

00:33.533 --> 00:34.767
- [whispers] Sorry.

00:34.833 --> 00:37.200
- Please stop apologizing,
Liza.

00:37.267 --> 00:39.400
You didn't embarrass yourself.

00:39.467 --> 00:40.700
I did.

00:40.767 --> 00:42.367
- No, you didn't.
It's--

00:43.467 --> 00:44.900
Okay, you did.

00:44.967 --> 00:45.900
But--

00:45.967 --> 00:47.867
- What do we do now?

00:49.733 --> 00:51.300
- Right.

00:58.933 --> 01:03.300
- * I'm tired of talking,
talking, talking *

01:03.367 --> 01:05.133
* Talking *

01:05.200 --> 01:08.667
* I've been nothing
but good to you *

01:08.733 --> 01:14.067
* 'Cause I've been nothing
but good to you *

01:14.067 --> 01:18.133
* Your howling into the night
won't do *

01:18.200 --> 01:22.833
* And I'm tired of talking,
talking, talking *

01:22.900 --> 01:24.167
* Talking *

01:28.067 --> 01:29.100
Okay.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.500
[laughs]

01:30.567 --> 01:33.367
[inhales deeply]

01:36.800 --> 01:37.867
- Girl?

01:37.933 --> 01:39.300
Ooh, rough night?

01:39.367 --> 01:40.933
- Rough sex.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.767
Best I've had in...

01:42.833 --> 01:44.333
Yeah, best I've had.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
[sighs]

01:45.467 --> 01:46.633
It was just a dream.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.400
- With a J guy?

01:48.467 --> 01:49.667
Ooh, Josh?

01:49.733 --> 01:51.333
- Uh, Charles.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.167
- Oh, let me guess.
You two were reading.

01:53.233 --> 01:54.933
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Doing crosswording.

01:55.067 --> 01:57.500
- No, it's just my subconscious
working overtime

01:57.567 --> 01:59.133
after Charles put his feelings
out there yesterday,

01:59.200 --> 02:00.833
which I'm still
freaking out about.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.367
- Oh, God, you two
and all your feelings.

02:02.433 --> 02:03.933
Just do it.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.567
- "It," as in
go have sex with Charles?

02:06.633 --> 02:07.833
- Yeah, what's the big deal?

02:07.900 --> 02:09.800
It's an office flirtation.

02:09.867 --> 02:11.167
Just get it over with.

02:11.233 --> 02:12.700
Consummate and deflate.

02:12.767 --> 02:15.067
- Oh, that's your advice?
Bang your boss?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.733
- It can't all be gold.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.933
- Well, that can't happen
for so many reasons.

02:20.067 --> 02:23.500
No, I have to ignore
my dream

02:23.567 --> 02:25.067
and march into his office

02:25.133 --> 02:27.467
and just shut this
workplace romance down.

02:27.533 --> 02:31.067
- Repression--healthy way
to start your day.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.067
[upbeat music]

02:34.100 --> 02:36.667
* *

02:36.733 --> 02:38.800
- You know that holds
more liquid

02:38.867 --> 02:40.600
than the average
human stomach, right?

02:40.667 --> 02:42.700
Kelsey?
- Hmm?

02:42.767 --> 02:44.867
I'm sorry. God.
I'm a little scattered today.

02:44.933 --> 02:46.667
I did not sleep last night.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.667
- Yeah, I was tossing
and turning last night too.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.500
- I mean, why am I
even going to work?

02:50.567 --> 02:52.067
It's a minefield.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.267
Charles blames me
for Zane poaching LL Moore.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.233
He's probably looming
outside my office right now.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.867
- Charles doesn't loom.

02:57.933 --> 02:59.733
- He's a giant.
Liza, he--he looms.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.767
- Well, then don't go
to the office, then.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.267
- Like, skip school?

03:04.333 --> 03:06.733
- No, no, I mean just go
straight to PitchFest.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.533
- Oh, my God, that's today.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.533
No, no, I cannot go
put on a fake smile

03:11.600 --> 03:13.067
and listen
to those hopeful amateurs

03:13.133 --> 03:14.533
pitch me
their "Gone Girl" rip-offs.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.933
- PitchFest is that bad?

03:16.067 --> 03:18.133
- It's like auditions
for "The Voice,"

03:18.200 --> 03:19.600
only you can't
turn your chair away.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.333
Nope, no, I like
your first idea better.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.767
Can you please cover for me?

03:24.833 --> 03:26.100
- Of course.

03:26.167 --> 03:28.067
Rest up.

03:29.067 --> 03:30.400
- [sighs]

03:30.467 --> 03:32.200
Wow.

03:35.167 --> 03:42.200
* *

03:47.833 --> 03:49.167
- Charles?

03:51.533 --> 03:53.533
- He's not coming in.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.533
- Oh, uh, did he say why?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.133
- Isn't it obvious?

03:57.200 --> 03:58.933
This has never happened,

03:59.067 --> 04:01.067
not even during Hurricane Sandy
when our power went out

04:01.133 --> 04:03.633
and he marched his thoroughbred
thighs up 40 flights.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.267
So brave.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.967
Kelsey's office is empty too.

04:07.067 --> 04:08.200
Did she run away
with her boyfriend,

04:08.267 --> 04:09.700
the big game poacher?

04:09.767 --> 04:13.600
- She's...working from home
today.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.633
- Pathetic attempt, Liza.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.867
But after
this LL Moore fiasco,

04:17.933 --> 04:20.600
I can't blame her
for making herself scarce.

04:32.733 --> 04:35.833
- This upstate vacay
will do wonders for you, dude.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.633
Okay, forget about work.
Forget about Zane.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.333
- I can't
if you keep reminding me.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.067
- But hey, forget your emails.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.533
Dude, this will be
a healing retreat, okay?

04:43.600 --> 04:44.967
Just you and me.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.300
It'll be like
an episode of "Girls,"

04:46.367 --> 04:48.667
except--except
we like each other.

04:48.733 --> 04:50.300
- Whoa.

04:50.367 --> 04:51.833
Was I high,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.967
or did I hear you leave,
like, two hours ago?

04:54.067 --> 04:55.500
- I'm taking
a mental health day.

04:55.567 --> 04:57.633
Or days.
It's almost the weekend.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.067
- What are you talking about?
It's Wednesday.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.400
- Hey, Hector has loaned us

05:00.467 --> 05:02.067
his house on the Hudson,
all right?

05:02.100 --> 05:06.367
There is a medium hot tub
and a hot hot tub.

05:06.433 --> 05:07.767
- Two hot tubs.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.767
One's for soaking.
One's for stroking.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.100
Hector's words, not mine.

05:11.167 --> 05:12.400
- Do you want to join?

05:12.467 --> 05:13.800
- Kelsey, no!
It's girlscation.

05:13.867 --> 05:15.867
I'm sorry; there are
no Adams allowed.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.667
- It's fine. Uh...

05:18.733 --> 05:20.733
Guess my friend here
won't be invited either, so...

05:20.800 --> 05:23.133
- Well, actually, you know,
it could be kind of handy

05:23.200 --> 05:24.367
having a house boy.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.067
- Yes!
You're hired.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.900
- Yeah!
- Give it here.

05:27.967 --> 05:29.733
- Here.
- [laughs]

[upbeat drum intro]

05:31.667 --> 05:35.900
[lively jazz music]

05:35.967 --> 05:37.467
- Edwina Dethridge

05:37.533 --> 05:39.567
is just an ordinary girl
from Poughkeepsie

05:39.633 --> 05:41.100
until one day,
she discovers

05:41.167 --> 05:43.267
she has an identical twin sister

05:43.333 --> 05:48.067
who is a queen
of an alien race of spiders.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.600
- So Edwina is a spider.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.767
- No?

05:52.833 --> 05:56.400
* *

05:56.467 --> 05:59.233
- You ready?

05:59.300 --> 06:03.267
Now, Lucky is a washed-up coach
in his 50s.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.767
But this is a Millennial story,

06:06.833 --> 06:10.067
because the object
of his desire is young,

06:10.067 --> 06:13.500
like Lolita young, hmm?

06:13.567 --> 06:18.800
* *

06:18.867 --> 06:20.800
- A girl sees a murder
on a bus,

06:20.867 --> 06:23.667
but she's a crackhead,
so no one believes her.

06:23.733 --> 06:25.833
And her memory's all messed up
'cause of the crack,

06:25.900 --> 06:28.967
so it's like maybe
she didn't see it;

06:29.067 --> 06:30.433
she did it.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.833
- So it's like, uh,
"Girl on the Train."

06:32.900 --> 06:35.600
- Not at all.
It happens on a bus.

06:35.667 --> 06:42.400

06:46.400 --> 06:48.700
[phone chimes]

06:51.167 --> 06:52.767
- [chuckles]

07:02.400 --> 07:04.233
- Hi.
Liza, right?

07:04.300 --> 07:08.067
Yes, I'm Pauline.
Nice to meet you.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.533
Oh, my God,
you must be exhausted.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.833
- [sighs]
- [laughs]

07:11.900 --> 07:14.333
I have never been around
so much nervous energy,

07:14.400 --> 07:15.867
and I've survived
two Peppa Pig concerts.

07:15.933 --> 07:17.367
- [laughs]

07:17.433 --> 07:18.833
- So I don't know
how this works.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.200
Do I just...
- Oh, your pitch.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.833
Yes, of course.
Just jump right in.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.367
- Okay, um, well...

07:24.433 --> 07:27.667
my book is kind of
"Primates of Park Avenue"

07:27.733 --> 07:29.900
meets Nora Ephron's
"Heartburn."

07:29.967 --> 07:31.200
- You had me at "Heartburn."

07:31.267 --> 07:32.200
- Oh, good.

07:32.267 --> 07:33.267
- Roman Ã  clef?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.600
- Um, sort of, yeah.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.933
Creative Writing 101:
Write what you know.

07:38.067 --> 07:40.467
I got married, had kids,

07:40.533 --> 07:42.533
did the things
you're meant to do.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.067
And I also sort of let
my husband steer the ship,

07:46.067 --> 07:48.833
which moored us
on the Upper East Side,

07:48.900 --> 07:51.067
and, whoa,
was I out of my depth.

07:51.133 --> 07:53.267
Pickups, drop-offs,

07:53.333 --> 07:55.700
hosting and attending
charity events.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.467
I had no time to work,
even freelance.

07:58.533 --> 08:02.533
So before I knew it, I just
lost sight of who I was

08:02.600 --> 08:05.600
as a writer, as a woman.

08:05.667 --> 08:09.067
Ugh, it's gonna sound
selfish and ungrateful,

08:09.133 --> 08:13.067
but...married life stifled me.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.200
I just needed to escape.

08:15.267 --> 08:16.900
I mean, I was losing it.

08:16.967 --> 08:19.533
I just needed a break.
I needed a little--

08:19.600 --> 08:20.633
- Marriage vacation.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.567
- Yes, you get it.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.133
You totally get it.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.733
But is it too heavy
for Millennial?

08:26.800 --> 08:30.067
I mean, I read about you guys
in "EW"'s "29 under 29,"

08:30.100 --> 08:33.067
so I know you skew
a lot younger.

08:33.133 --> 08:35.267
Would it be more
of an Empirical book?

08:35.333 --> 08:37.267
- You know, actually,
I think it could appeal

08:37.333 --> 08:39.733
to Millennial readers
as a cautionary tale--

08:39.800 --> 08:43.067
you know, understand
what marriage is,

08:43.133 --> 08:44.667
go in with eyes open.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.867
- Oh, I love that take.

08:46.933 --> 08:48.967
Look, it's just
a work in progress.

08:49.067 --> 08:50.533
I don't even have a title yet.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.133
But could I email you
some chapters?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.467
- Yeah, I--please.
Please do.

08:55.533 --> 08:56.967
I would love that.

08:57.067 --> 08:59.400
- Thank you.
It's so nice to meet you.

08:59.467 --> 09:02.067
Good luck
with all these people.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.933

09:09.067 --> 09:11.300
- House boy
reporting for duty.

09:11.367 --> 09:13.333
- [laughs]

09:14.567 --> 09:15.800
- This place is a dump.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.133
- Oh, it's the pits.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.167
- There you go.

09:18.233 --> 09:20.167
- Yes.

09:20.233 --> 09:22.067
- Are you still working?

09:22.100 --> 09:24.500
- Don't tell Lauren.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.633
- Oh, you creepin', Kels?

09:30.700 --> 09:31.867
- What?
- Yeah.

09:31.933 --> 09:34.200
- God, vain much?

09:34.267 --> 09:37.133
- Surprise shaman!

09:37.200 --> 09:38.667
So I recently graduated

09:38.733 --> 09:40.867
from my online
shamanic studies course.

09:40.933 --> 09:42.533
Best 40 bucks ever spent,
by the way.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.367
And then I went on Darknet,

09:44.433 --> 09:47.100
and I ordered everything needed
to brew ayahuasca.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.833
- What?
- Yes!

09:48.900 --> 09:50.200
Now we can finally access
the parts of our brains

09:50.267 --> 09:52.500
that we're born with
and we die with.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.333
- Okay, wait, my buddy Sky
went and did this

09:54.400 --> 09:55.800
in Joshua Tree,
and he came back

09:55.867 --> 09:58.100
with one blue eye,
one brown.

09:58.167 --> 09:59.200
They used to be green.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.767
- [gasps]
Oh.

10:02.000 --> 10:02.967
- Josh?
Josh!

10:03.033 --> 10:04.733
- No!

10:04.800 --> 10:06.633
- That shit is sacred, okay?

10:06.700 --> 10:08.367
Not to be messed with.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.167
You either do it in Peru
or you don't do it at all.

10:11.233 --> 10:14.100
[phone ringing]
- You're fired!

10:14.167 --> 10:16.600
- Liza.
Hey.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.000
Oh, my God,
thanks for covering for me.

10:18.067 --> 10:19.600
I'm sure it's a total shitshow.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.467
- It is, but I did hear
one amazing pitch--

10:25.533 --> 10:27.300
mature, sophisticated.

10:27.367 --> 10:29.333
I think it could really expand
the Millennial brand.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.600
I already have
the first couple chapters.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.367
You want to read?

10:32.433 --> 10:36.000
- I will, but I'm kind of
disconnecting upstate.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.833
- Oh, okay.
By yourself?

10:37.900 --> 10:40.233
- No, Lauren's here.
- Hi!

10:40.300 --> 10:42.033
- Hey.
Good, I'm glad you're not alone.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.500
All right, I'll just--
I'll leave you to it.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.300
- Okay, I'll see you
in the city.

10:46.900 --> 10:49.367
- Uh, why didn't you say
Josh was with us?

10:49.433 --> 10:50.533
- Oh.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.500
Uh...

10:52.567 --> 10:54.567
no reason.

10:58.267 --> 11:02.633
* *

11:06.267 --> 11:09.267
* *

11:09.333 --> 11:11.167
- [laughs]
Oh, my God.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.267
We should just stay here.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.367
- Yup.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.867
- I'll get a bar job,

11:14.933 --> 11:16.300
commit to my passion
for day drinking.

11:16.367 --> 11:17.367
- Ooh, yes, and I'll run
the ghost tours

11:17.433 --> 11:18.800
in Sleepy Hollow.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.400
- Josh could open
a tattoo shop.

11:20.467 --> 11:22.267
- [gasps]
Dude, I knew it.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.533
- You knew what?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.300
- Wait, clearly, it was
my shamanic energy, okay?

11:27.367 --> 11:29.233
I have been shipping you two
since you moved in together.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.667
I have been offering you
up to the universe

11:30.733 --> 11:32.067
as a pair bond,
and she has heard me.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.167
Namaste!

11:34.233 --> 11:37.067
- Speak English, please.

11:37.133 --> 11:38.400
- You're in love with Josh.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.067
Wha--no?

11:42.067 --> 11:43.700
Ah, okay, okay.
So wait.

11:43.767 --> 11:45.567
He's in love with you,
and you're just what?

11:45.633 --> 11:47.433
You're just serving him up
some pity clitty.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.767
Yeah, that's sad, Kelsey,
but, you know, I've been there.

11:49.833 --> 11:53.300
- No, Josh and I are friends.
That's all.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.867
- No, no, that is exactly how
these things always start, dude.

11:55.933 --> 11:57.767
Have you seen a single
Cameron Diaz movie?

11:59.600 --> 12:02.267
- Listen, I know this is hard
for you to understand,

12:02.333 --> 12:04.533
but not everyone wants
to screw the crew.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.833
- [laughs] No,
it's gonna happen, dude, okay?

12:06.900 --> 12:10.533
The universe wills it so.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.533
- Yo!

12:11.600 --> 12:13.233
Yo.
[laughs]

12:13.300 --> 12:14.867
You guys got to come inside
and see this.

12:14.933 --> 12:17.267
I know I'm super stoned
right now,

12:17.333 --> 12:19.067
but this is crazy.

12:19.133 --> 12:20.267
It's crazy!

12:20.333 --> 12:21.800
[both laughing and coughing]

12:21.867 --> 12:24.167
- Let's go.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.067
- Are you ready for this?

12:28.067 --> 12:29.667
They're everywhere.
- What?

12:29.733 --> 12:33.067
- Dicks.
- [shrieks] Oh, my God!

12:33.067 --> 12:34.933
- The doorknob's a knob.

12:35.067 --> 12:36.167
- [laughs]

12:36.233 --> 12:37.300
- You guys, I knew Hector was

12:37.367 --> 12:38.833
a huge Keith Haring fan,

12:38.900 --> 12:41.067
but this is next-level
willy worship.

12:41.133 --> 12:42.767
[laughing]
Oh, my God.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.933
- It's a members only club.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.600
- Oh, my God,
it's a penis palace!

12:49.667 --> 12:52.167
- Yo! There's
a bone throne in there.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.400
- A what?
- A bone throne.

12:54.467 --> 12:55.667
- Oh, my God,
that looks painful.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.133
Lauren, get down now.

12:57.200 --> 13:03.067
* *

13:03.100 --> 13:05.067
[phone chimes]

13:05.067 --> 13:08.867
* *

13:08.933 --> 13:10.667
- [sighs]

13:17.967 --> 13:19.467
[elevator dings]

13:40.300 --> 13:45.267
* *

14:19.500 --> 14:21.967
[knocking at door]

14:22.067 --> 14:24.067
- Come in.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.067
- Hey.

14:31.067 --> 14:33.067
- Hey.

14:38.267 --> 14:39.667
Never did get around

14:39.733 --> 14:42.067
to eating that cupcake
yesterday.

14:42.133 --> 14:44.400
- Yeah, it's probably hard
by now.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.100
I--I mean stale.
Dry.

14:47.167 --> 14:48.467
I don't know what I'm saying.

14:48.533 --> 14:50.900
- You okay?

14:50.967 --> 14:53.200
Uh, you seem a little jumpy.

15:07.467 --> 15:08.733
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.200
- What?

15:10.267 --> 15:11.300
- I have you tell you
something.

15:11.367 --> 15:13.467
- Don't talk.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.633
All we do is talk.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.067
[rattling noise]

15:21.133 --> 15:22.267
- What's that?

15:22.333 --> 15:23.467
- The janitor?

15:23.533 --> 15:24.733
Shit, the janitor!

15:24.800 --> 15:26.767
Oh, my God.

15:30.367 --> 15:32.067
- Hey, George.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.133
- Oh, sorry. I didn't know
anyone was still here.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.067
- Uh, yeah, just--
just finishing up.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.367
- Oh, yeah, we were--

15:38.433 --> 15:39.700
I was just telling Charles

15:39.767 --> 15:41.700
about this, um, incredible book

15:41.767 --> 15:43.300
that I got pitched.

15:43.367 --> 15:46.167
- It's first-rate.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.133
Yeah, that--that fell.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.800
It's all set.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.467
- Bye-bye.
Thank you.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.100
- Good night, George.

16:12.167 --> 16:13.900
- [laughs]
Oh, my God.

16:13.967 --> 16:15.900
- Pauline Turner?

16:15.967 --> 16:17.200
What is this?

16:17.267 --> 16:20.067
- Oh, um, it's great,
actually.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.533
This is by
a first-time novelist

16:22.600 --> 16:25.067
about a wife who gives up
her career to be a mom

16:25.133 --> 16:27.367
and then feels suffocated
by her own life,

16:27.433 --> 16:30.667
so she kind of takes
a vacation from her family.

16:30.733 --> 16:32.467
I met her at PitchFest.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.767
- What did she look like?

16:35.067 --> 16:38.733
- Uh, well, um...why?

16:38.800 --> 16:41.800
- Uh, did she look like this?

16:47.167 --> 16:49.333
- How do you have a picture
with Pauline?

16:53.100 --> 16:55.067
- Because I was married to her.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.300
* *

17:01.167 --> 17:04.100
[laidback music]

17:04.167 --> 17:05.967
* *

17:06.067 --> 17:07.400
- Charles, I am so sorry.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.800
I--she--

17:09.867 --> 17:11.300
Pauline--

17:11.367 --> 17:13.267
I just--I didn't know
that she was your--

17:13.333 --> 17:15.933
She didn't say anything
about you.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.467
- I have to get home.

17:17.533 --> 17:19.800
I have to--I have to
read this carefully,

17:19.867 --> 17:20.967
call my lawyer.

17:21.067 --> 17:24.267
Uh...good night.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.633
- Hello?

17:35.700 --> 17:37.533
- Sorry!

17:48.067 --> 17:49.533
- Psst!

17:49.600 --> 17:50.833
Hey.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.967
What's going on?
You can't sleep?

17:53.067 --> 17:55.100
- Mm-mm.
- Me either.

17:55.167 --> 17:57.067
It's too quiet out here.

17:57.067 --> 18:00.333
I miss the sound
of ambulances and jackhammers.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.900
You know?

18:04.067 --> 18:07.067
Oh.
[laughs]

18:07.067 --> 18:08.667
- It was all I could find.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.167
- Okay, I'm just gonna drink
right from the bottle,

18:10.233 --> 18:12.767
if that's okay with you.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.233
- So it turns out

18:16.300 --> 18:17.567
that running away
from your problems

18:17.633 --> 18:19.133
is as dumb as it sounds.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.733
- Why?

18:20.800 --> 18:21.733
What's going on?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.533
- I love my job.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.933
And I could lose it.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.067
- You're not gonna lose it.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.067
You're a boss, Kels.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.667
- And I'm scared
to trust people.

18:30.733 --> 18:34.467
Like, I let Zane in,
trusted him,

18:34.533 --> 18:36.067
got burned again.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.333
- I get that.

18:37.400 --> 18:42.200
I mean,
I trusted Liza, Montana.

18:42.267 --> 18:43.567
It's starting to feel like

18:43.633 --> 18:46.200
everyone's just out
for themselves.

18:46.267 --> 18:48.567
- Well, everyone has
an agenda.

18:48.633 --> 18:49.833
- I don't.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.367
- Neither do I.

18:53.267 --> 18:56.467
Okay, well, maybe I have
a little agenda,

18:56.533 --> 18:58.733
but I'm not an asshole
about it.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.567
- Look.

19:00.633 --> 19:07.067
You are gonna bounce back
just fine, all right?

19:07.067 --> 19:10.067
You're one of the strongest
people I know, so...

19:13.333 --> 19:15.433
- I'm glad you're here.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.767
- Yeah, me too.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.333
- * They say
you're doing well *

19:29.400 --> 19:32.133
* You're doing just fine *

19:32.200 --> 19:35.967
* I hear it all the time *

19:36.067 --> 19:37.633
- We can't.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.333
- I know.
I'm sorry.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.933
That was a crazy idea.

19:42.067 --> 19:44.200
- No, it's not crazy.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.300
- [sighs]

19:45.367 --> 19:47.767
- It's just not right.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.533
* *

19:50.600 --> 19:52.567
- Yeah.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.600
- Good night, Josh.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.467
* *

19:56.533 --> 19:59.267
- * And I thought
it'd get easier *

19:59.333 --> 20:03.233
* It's getting harder to hide *

20:06.367 --> 20:09.000
- * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

20:09.067 --> 20:11.600
* Ooh-ooh *

20:11.667 --> 20:14.900
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

20:14.967 --> 20:16.567
* Ooh-ooh *

20:16.633 --> 20:19.133
* *

20:19.200 --> 20:21.900
[phone buzzing]

20:23.700 --> 20:25.400
- Charles, is everything okay?

20:25.467 --> 20:26.567
- Yeah, yeah.

20:26.633 --> 20:28.267
I'm--I'm sorry, Liza,

20:28.333 --> 20:30.633
for that--for that
very abrupt exit.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.800
But I read--I read
Pauline's chapters.

20:33.867 --> 20:35.533
- Must be awful

20:35.600 --> 20:37.200
to have your life
mischaracterized in that way.

20:37.267 --> 20:42.200
- Well, actually,
some of it's pretty honest.

20:42.267 --> 20:43.533
- Oh?
- Yeah.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.667
She makes some parallels
to--to me

20:46.733 --> 20:48.933
and--and to our marriage, and--

20:49.000 --> 20:53.333
But I am just trying
to figure out what to do next.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.200
- Maybe you should call her.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.000
- You know,
I think I'd rather wait

20:57.067 --> 20:59.100
until I've read the whole book,
if it's out there.

20:59.167 --> 21:03.367
But look, I will take care
of this,

21:03.433 --> 21:05.833
and I am--I'm very sorry

21:05.900 --> 21:08.367
that you got pulled into this,
Liza.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.733
And by the way,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.633
I don't regret

21:12.700 --> 21:16.067
what happened tonight
at all,

21:16.100 --> 21:18.600
just the way it got interrupted.

21:21.733 --> 21:23.300
Good night.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.067
- Good night.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.700
[sighs]
