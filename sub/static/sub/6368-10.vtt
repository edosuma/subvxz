01:22.015 --> 01:24.099
Where aren't you?

01:25.519 --> 01:28.386
You aren't in the brig at Fort Benning

01:28.438 --> 01:31.306
facing a court-martial that
could have landed you two years

01:31.308 --> 01:34.059
in military prison and turned
you into an even meaner asshole

I had you moved.

01:40.284 --> 01:42.367
You're welcome.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.992
- So what is this?
- Well, I guess it's math class,

01:51.044 --> 01:53.078
because I'm not wearing
a rank or an insignia

01:53.130 --> 01:58.383

- Special Ops?

You're Job.
<i>The Job.</i>

03:55.368 --> 03:58.753
<i>In '91, you hacked
Banco Nacional of Caracas</i>

03:58.789 --> 04:03.374
and transferred $7 million to humanitarian
nonprofits across South America.

04:03.427 --> 04:06.628
Six months later, you infected the
mainframe of Wing-Lijun Shipping

04:06.680 --> 04:09.764
<i>with a botnet virus that cost
them almost 100 million...</i>

04:09.800 --> 04:12.016
I know the words coming out your
face are technically English,

04:12.052 --> 04:15.437
but I still don't know what
the fuck you talking about.

04:17.307 --> 04:20.358
I spent seven years at
cybercrimes tracking you,

04:20.392 --> 04:24.312
studying your work.
The hack into the armory,

04:24.364 --> 04:27.482
that was simple compared
with your other efforts.

04:27.484 --> 04:30.985
But the way you pulled off the
timed reverse on our power grid...

04:30.987 --> 04:33.037
I mean, there are maybe
two or three other hackers

04:33.073 --> 04:35.490
who could have pulled that off 
and they live in China.

04:35.492 --> 04:39.160
Then why don't you fuck off over there
and bore them to death?

04:39.162 --> 04:41.663
Hmm?

04:43.834 --> 04:47.469
In '94, you infiltrated the NSA database

04:47.504 --> 04:52.257
and deleted the personnel records
of 40 covert military operatives.

04:53.844 --> 04:56.094
My theory...

04:56.146 --> 04:59.814
you just needed to disappear one guy.

05:01.017 --> 05:05.353
<i>But you were just being thorough,
as always.</i>

05:05.355 --> 05:08.856
<i>Well, that one put you on
the CIA's radar for good.</i>

05:11.945 --> 05:18.750
I would tell you again you have
mistaken me for someone else...

05:21.371 --> 05:23.955
but you seem so goddamn excited,

05:24.007 --> 05:28.376
<i>I hate to ruin your fun, Leo.</i>

05:34.935 --> 05:38.219
You're the golden ticket, Job.

05:39.723 --> 05:42.857
And I am going to cash you in.

06:00.544 --> 06:02.410
I'm sorry.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.638
You're impetuous, reckless.
You defied me.

06:06.673 --> 06:09.167
I thought I was helping you.

06:21.932 --> 06:26.517
Thank you, Burton.

You'll learn, Rebecca.

you have to accept the fact</i>

06:43.453 --> 06:46.036
that you don't know anything.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.958
- Not yet.
- I understand.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.260
Having said that,
we've both made mistakes,

06:52.295 --> 06:56.130

07:56.693 --> 07:59.444
[chuckles]
He's okay.

08:01.614 --> 08:06.000
You got any idea
 how Stowe landed on us?

08:09.339 --> 08:13.174
- We got sloppy.
- Well, he doesn't know everything,

08:13.209 --> 08:15.960
and that's the only thing keeping
us alive until help arrives.

08:16.012 --> 08:19.213
Yeah? 
And who's gonna help him, hmm?

08:19.215 --> 08:23.768
That man has exactly three
friends and they all right here.

<i>Sugar: Have some faith, huh?</i>

08:26.056 --> 08:27.555

<i>- Carrie: He's gonna come.
- Job: Oh, I know he'll come.</i>

08:32.062 --> 08:34.395
<i>He'll take on the whole
motherfucking platoon.</i>

08:34.447 --> 08:36.731
Might even make it past the front gate.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.282
But there's still a shitload of mercs

08:38.318 --> 08:40.400
<i>with a shitload of
guns between him and us.</i>

08:40.453 --> 08:44.455
I need to see Colonel Stowe.
We're old friends.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.293

How many more times does he have
to put his ass on the line for you

09:03.093 --> 09:05.560
- until he gets his motherfucking head blown off?
- You're blaming me for this?

09:05.595 --> 09:07.345
I ain't the one who fucked the mark!

09:07.397 --> 09:10.348
- Oh, fuck you, Job.
- No, fuck you, Carrie!

09:10.400 --> 09:13.568
Or Ana. Or whatever the fuck
you calling yourself today!

09:13.603 --> 09:15.403
- If you were so worried...
- How'd your boyfriend know exactly...

09:15.438 --> 09:17.105
- ...you could have shut this job down.
- ...how to take us all down?

09:17.107 --> 09:19.774
- I'm a professional.
- What the fuck did you let slip?

09:19.826 --> 09:21.409
- You tell me what you told that motherfucker!
- I didn't tell him anything.

09:21.444 --> 09:25.246
- How dare you?!
- Both of you shut the fuck up!

- I was in the neighborhood.

I don't have time for games.
If you have business with me, get to it.

10:12.212 --> 10:16.130
What's going on, Colonel?
Everything okay?

10:19.169 --> 10:22.070
Look, Sheriff, I can only imagine
how boring and insignificant

10:22.071 --> 10:24.972
your life must be, but
honestly, I don't give two shits.

10:25.008 --> 10:28.259
If you don't have a reason to be here,
then get the fuck off my base.

10:28.311 --> 10:30.178
I got six million reasons.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.553
The sheriff is a thief.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.390
[whispers] I'm not really a sheriff.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.693
You've come here to negotiate?

11:18.728 --> 11:21.395
I came here to tell you that
if you don't let my friends go,

11:21.397 --> 11:23.564
you'll never see your money again.

11:23.566 --> 11:26.367
I can keep you here,
remove your fingers one by one

11:26.402 --> 11:28.069
until you tell me where the cash is.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.621
We both know I wouldn't have
come here without insurance.

11:30.657 --> 11:34.075
Right now I have
no clue where your money is.

11:34.077 --> 11:35.576
And if I'm not back in half an hour,

11:35.578 --> 11:39.247

12:11.915 --> 12:14.365

You're dehydrated.

12:31.601 --> 12:34.385
Your organs are starting to shut down.

12:34.437 --> 12:37.054
Sure you can feel it.
The headaches, the chills.

12:37.106 --> 12:40.141
Soon the hallucinations

12:40.193 --> 12:42.860
<i>you'll lose all sense of reality.</i>

Tell me the truth.
I will reward you.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.154
<i>What was your mother's name?</i>

12:53.206 --> 12:55.206
[weakly] Catherine.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.491
Catherine. Was she a good mother?

12:57.493 --> 12:59.210
I guess so.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.214
I'm gonna need you to be
more definitive with me.

13:03.249 --> 13:07.001
<i>Was she a good mother?</i>

13:07.003 --> 13:09.003
- Yes.
- Yes.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.838
- Did you love her?
- Yes.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.057
Yes.

13:13.092 --> 13:18.846
Your father's name was Dennis.
Dennis.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.515
- Did you love him, too?
- Yes.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.656
Your father regularly beat
the shit out of your mother.

13:28.691 --> 13:30.408
Put her in the hospital six times.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.076
<i>He beat you, too, didn't he?</i>

13:32.111 --> 13:34.228
- No.
- Of course he did.

13:34.364 --> 13:36.414
- No.
- Of course he did!

13:36.449 --> 13:38.366
<i>That's why you had to kill him.</i>

13:44.290 --> 13:45.706
I didn't kill him.

13:45.708 --> 13:49.210
Of course you killed him.

13:49.212 --> 13:50.711
He was a horrible man
who made you suffer.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.546
He made you and your mother suffer.

13:52.548 --> 13:54.432

Just tell me that you killed him.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.184
Hmm? Tell me the truth.
Now I want you to tell me the truth.

13:57.220 --> 13:58.886
- I didn't kill him.
- All I want you to do is tell me the truth.

13:58.938 --> 14:00.471
- No.
- I want you to say to me,

14:00.523 --> 14:03.107
<i>"I killed my father."
I want you to admit it.</i>

14:03.142 --> 14:05.026
<i>Tell me that you killed him.</i>

You're safe. You're here with me.
You had to make him suffer.

14:08.147 --> 14:11.232
- I didn't kill him.
- Just admit that you killed your father.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.984
Tell me the truth.
Tell me that you killed him.

14:14.037 --> 14:16.287
<i>- I killed him.
- What?</i>

14:16.322 --> 14:18.406

- It's been a long time.

Welcome home.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.952
- Not bad, huh?
- [sighs] Yeah.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.673
You know, when you
disappeared that night,

16:32.708 --> 16:36.377
<i>I thought you just needed to
clear your head for a minute.</i>

16:36.379 --> 16:41.706
- But this is a lot to take in.
- I'm sure.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.472
Now you're back just as
suddenly as you left, huh?

16:48.524 --> 16:50.224
<i>It was time to come home.</i>

16:50.226 --> 16:51.942
Right.

16:56.399 --> 16:58.899
You left us in the
lurch that night, Kurt.

17:00.570 --> 17:03.237
There were some who wanted
to hunt you down, make you pay.

17:03.289 --> 17:06.874
But I defended you.
I lied to the Brotherhood for you.

17:06.909 --> 17:11.662
And now you come back here unannounced

17:11.714 --> 17:14.080
and you do what you did 
to Jasper and Bryce.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.134
You're making it very hard
for me to keep you safe.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.420
Am I?

17:21.840 --> 17:25.425
Still...
you're my blood.

17:25.478 --> 17:29.063
And like you always said,
brothers before Brotherhood, right?

17:29.098 --> 17:32.516
So, big brother, I'm gonna give
you a chance to do the right thing.

17:32.568 --> 17:37.154
You take off this uniform
and you come back to your real family.

I'm not the dumb little shit I was

took me to my first rally.

There is no walking away from it.

18:13.643 --> 18:16.026

who the fuck am I in business with?</i>

19:22.044 --> 19:23.877
You or her?

19:23.879 --> 19:26.764
- You're in business with us.
- So you say.

19:26.849 --> 19:30.801
But one says "yes", the other says "no."

19:30.853 --> 19:34.605
- And now I have no product at all.
- We're here to change all of that.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.107
You didn't pull up in a truck.

21:34.510 --> 21:39.396
That anger is there
to protect you from fear.

21:39.431 --> 21:42.065
Now, we could argue that the fear

21:42.101 --> 21:45.152
comes from an abusive and drunk father,

21:45.187 --> 21:46.570
but it doesn't really
matter where it comes from.

21:46.605 --> 21:50.357
<i>What matters is that it can be beaten.</i>

21:51.577 --> 21:53.827
I'm gonna rid you of that burden

21:53.863 --> 21:57.030
so you can reach your potential.

44:37.024 --> 44:40.726
Every fucked-up thing that he's done,

44:40.778 --> 44:42.561
I have done.

44:44.315 --> 44:47.616
I've done things
that would make you sick.

44:48.703 --> 44:51.070
They make me sick.

44:59.247 --> 45:02.368
You think you're the only one
around here that's got dirt on him?

45:04.085 --> 45:07.086
I've done some... things.

45:10.391 --> 45:12.391
Fuck, Bunker, I...

45:14.178 --> 45:16.312
I don't know you, okay?

45:16.347 --> 45:20.983
But from what I've seen,
you're not the man you used to be.

45:32.964 --> 45:36.362
I will always be that man.

45:36.968 --> 45:40.452
Putting on this uniform
does not wipe my slate clean.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.458
I'm doing everything I can to change.

45:48.512 --> 45:50.846
And every once in a while...

45:52.717 --> 45:57.960
I manage to convince myself
that I'm a better person.

46:00.391 --> 46:03.943
But the minute that I come into contact

46:03.978 --> 46:06.645
with one of those fucking guys

46:06.697 --> 46:09.531
and see the way that they look at me,

46:09.567 --> 46:13.986
all I feel is hate

46:13.988 --> 46:16.872
and anger
and I can't shake it.

46:16.907 --> 46:18.540
Okay, all right. Listen to me.

46:18.626 --> 46:20.209
Listen, listen. Hold it. 
Look at me.

46:20.244 --> 46:23.829
Okay, that isn't anger
that you're feeling.

46:23.831 --> 46:27.132
That's the shame and the guilt.

46:27.168 --> 46:31.553
And trust me, we all feel that.
All of us.

46:31.589 --> 46:34.923
And that is what makes
you better than them.

46:34.976 --> 46:37.393
<i>If you didn't feel that,</i>

46:37.428 --> 46:42.815
that's when I'd start to worry, all right?
You hear me?

46:44.018 --> 46:45.734
<i>Okay.</i>

46:45.770 --> 46:48.421
Now, look, can you promise
me that what happened

46:48.422 --> 46:51.073
out there today is
never gonna happen again?

46:53.494 --> 46:55.577
I don't know.

46:57.198 --> 46:58.864
Good answer.

46:58.866 --> 47:01.083
'Cause if you had said yes,
I knew you were full of shit.

47:01.118 --> 47:03.118
[chuckles]

47:03.170 --> 47:06.241
Go home, all right?
Get some sleep.

47:08.626 --> 47:11.927
- Thank you, sir.
- Yep.

47:20.284 --> 47:24.010
[music]

47:30.147 --> 47:32.064
<i>Brock: I just hung up
with the state police.</i>

47:32.066 --> 47:35.901
<i>Jesus Christ, Hood.
Gordon Hopewell is dead?</i>

47:35.903 --> 47:37.486
What the hell happened out there?

47:37.538 --> 47:40.956
<i>He said that...
Camp Genoa looks like a war zone.</i>

47:52.586 --> 47:55.087
Yeah, I'll have to tell
you about it someday.

47:55.089 --> 47:57.139
No, no, not someday.

47:57.174 --> 47:59.591
He said that CID is gonna
be here in less than an hour.

47:59.643 --> 48:00.759
We need to get your story straight.

48:00.811 --> 48:03.429
They're coming to talk to you, Brock.

48:03.481 --> 48:08.517
What are you talking about?
Hood?

48:31.625 --> 48:34.543
Badge and letter of
resignation on my desk.

48:35.713 --> 48:38.764
Are you kidding?
Hey! Hood!

48:40.718 --> 48:45.304
Where you going?
You can't...

48:45.356 --> 48:46.972
You can't just leave!

48:49.477 --> 48:52.027
Well, I'm not giving it back this time.

49:23.677 --> 49:26.145
[straining]

49:32.353 --> 49:34.319
I'm disappointed in you, Kurt.

49:35.573 --> 49:37.439
But the choice is yours to make.

49:37.491 --> 49:40.192
[breathing heavily]

49:40.244 --> 49:42.194
[straining]

49:42.196 --> 49:44.580
If you're gonna wear that cop
uniform, you can't wear mine.

[screaming]

50:04.885 --> 50:06.885
<i>[glasses clinking]</i>

50:18.482 --> 50:20.566
Who in the hell took him?

50:24.572 --> 50:26.572
I don't know.

50:29.460 --> 50:33.245
- How do we find him?
- No idea.

50:35.299 --> 50:38.250
Usually that's where Job comes in.

50:41.388 --> 50:44.240
- Isn't there anyone you can reach out...
- God damn it, Sugar.

50:44.241 --> 50:45.424
I don't fucking know.

50:46.810 --> 50:49.061
I don't know who took him.
I don't know where he is.

50:49.096 --> 50:50.762
And I don't know how
to fucking get him back.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.103
Fuck.

51:04.328 --> 51:07.829
Till we hear from him, he's on his own.

51:28.636 --> 51:31.053
[sighs]

51:31.105 --> 51:33.689
<i>Man: Hey, you look like a new man.</i>

51:33.724 --> 51:38.560
<i>Which means your time in this room</i>

51:38.612 --> 51:40.479
is done.

52:06.006 --> 52:11.810
- Who are you?
- My name is Dalton.

52:13.981 --> 52:17.182
- Are you military?
- I was.

52:17.234 --> 52:23.488
But now I recruit men like you.
I develop them for an elite unit.

52:25.275 --> 52:28.910
What unit?
What branch?

52:28.946 --> 52:31.363
Exactly.

52:32.700 --> 52:34.533
<i>My methods are very unorthodox.</i>

52:34.535 --> 52:37.369
I have a very small window of time
in which to assess your ability.

52:37.371 --> 52:40.956
- My ability to do what?
- To do what needs to be done.

52:41.008 --> 52:43.542
I think we could do some
very good work together.

52:46.930 --> 52:51.350
- And if I'm not interested?
- That's fine. You're free to go.

52:53.554 --> 52:56.972
But if you do, you'll
always be your father's son.

53:05.032 --> 53:06.982
I'm nothing like him.

53:32.426 --> 53:35.260
What happened to your
friends with the beards?

53:35.312 --> 53:37.763
They're all dead.

53:39.900 --> 53:43.068
You sure do have a knack for survival.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.421
You left me there to die, Sheriff.

54:04.041 --> 54:06.291
I'm not the sheriff.

54:09.930 --> 54:12.514
What do you want, an apology?

54:13.383 --> 54:17.853
No.
I would have done the same thing.

54:37.324 --> 54:40.625
You know, being the sheriff
never really suited you.

54:42.830 --> 54:44.996
No, it didn't.
