00:03.537 --> 00:06.211
Charlie? She's been making donations
through her aliases...

00:06.406 --> 00:08.579
...to Shawnee General County
here in Topeka.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.345
- To the charity?
- A patient, Gertrude Middleton.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.024
She and her husband
were hit by a drunk driver.

00:13.213 --> 00:16.318
I was at a sleepover, and I got scared.

00:16.517 --> 00:20.897
I called my parents to come and get me. They
should never have been driving that night.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.089
This thing's gotta go.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.893
It'll take a very powerful force
to remove the effect.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.094
Then burn it off. I'm not living like this.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.432
Cain still has the mark.
So he's lived with it.

00:29.696 --> 00:33.007
Maybe there's a part of you
that wants to give in to it.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.841
And maybe you have to fight that.
Part of that powerful force has to be you.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.617
Saving people, hunting things,
the family business? I am down.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.878
But where's my quest?

00:43.076 --> 00:45.420
That's the key to Oz.
There are magical ways to Oz.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.388
This key will turn any locked door
into a portal to Oz.

00:48.582 --> 00:49.856
- You coming, or what?
- To Oz?

00:50.050 --> 00:53.623
Yeah, you said you were looking
for adventure. Well, here it is, red.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.102
Please.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.673
I don't know anything else.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.639
I know. I'm gonna torture you anyway.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.447
Because who doesn't love a little torture?

01:54.982 --> 02:00.022
All right, well, just keep me posted, okay?
Yeah, you got it. Wait, Cass, you there?

02:00.287 --> 02:03.029
Hey, thanks. Yeah.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.433
You made egg-white omelets?

02:07.628 --> 02:10.472
Breakfast of champions.
You know, if you're a dork like you.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.302
And you slept past 7.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.479
Till we get answers on this Mark of Cain...

02:14.668 --> 02:17.945
...I am on a 12-step program not
to backslide. - Twelve steps?

02:18.138 --> 02:21.449
Yeah. Hey, if Cain found a way to live
with it after going dark side...

02:21.642 --> 02:24.987
...I just gotta find a way to keep it in
check. So haven't had a drink in a week...

02:25.178 --> 02:29.217
...eight hours of rack time every night,
and now, this masterpiece.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.520
- That's three steps.
- Shut up and eat.

02:39.192 --> 02:42.036
- Wow, that's awesome.
- It's crap.

02:43.230 --> 02:47.542
Ugh, God. Soon as we get rid
of this demonic tramp stamp...

02:47.734 --> 02:51.580
...I am back on the booze, burgers,
and more booze.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.840
Tell me you got something.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.608
What the hell?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.777
Cain or Crowley?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.605
Charlie.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.575
She's back from Oz? She didn't call?

03:25.772 --> 03:29.413
Yeah, uh, she's been busy.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.116
Why are you doing this?

03:34.281 --> 03:36.124
What the hell am I looking at?

03:37.584 --> 03:41.225
So I was looking into the news,
checking for anything weird, right?

03:41.421 --> 03:45.528
I found this story about a torture vic. Some
kid videotaped this at his neighbor's house.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.797
What are you saying,
Charlie tortured someone?

03:48.295 --> 03:51.799
Our Charlie? Ya? high, wouldn't hurt
a Hobbit, practically sparkles?

03:57.804 --> 03:59.112
Come on, Charlie, pick up.

03:59.306 --> 04:02.253
The guy she went all Jack Bauer on?
Peter Harper.

04:02.442 --> 04:05.616
- She's not answering.
- District attorney in Topeka.

04:05.812 --> 04:09.259
According to this article, he wasn't
the only person in town that was hit.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.157
A court stenographer was assaulted
the night before.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.763
Charlie wouldn't go off on someone
without a reason.

04:14.955 --> 04:18.834
- I wouldn't think so, but look at the video.
- Oh, I'm looking. But what we do...

04:19.059 --> 04:23.166
...taken out of context, don't look
that much different. She could be hunting.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.173
Why don't we go talk to this asshat
and see what's going on?

04:45.352 --> 04:47.127
Hey, ready?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.695
- Yeah. Yeah, let's do this.
- Let's go.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.363
Now, did you notice anything odd
before the attack?

04:54.594 --> 04:57.507
Maybe strange smells? Weird noises?

04:57.697 --> 05:01.372
No. No, nothing. I was just at home here,
getting ready for bed...

05:01.601 --> 05:03.877
...and that crazy bitch jumped me.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.180
All she wanted to know was about some case
that I worked on years ago.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.686
Drunk driver T-boned another car,
killing the driver...

05:12.179 --> 05:14.853
...and the passenger was declared
brain-dead on the scene.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.152
The Middletons.

05:16.349 --> 05:19.193
They had a daughter, 12,
they were on their way to pick her up.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.458
- That's right. How'd you know that?
- We do our homework at the FBI.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.227
Okay, well, then you know
the case never went to trial.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.905
Before I could see the evidence,
it was off the books, files were sealed.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.735
- How is that even possible?
- I don't know.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.207
I looked into it this morning,
there's no record of that case anywhere.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.643
And the arresting officer
has since passed away.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.909
There's nothing except for this.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.150
The Social Service file
on the Middleton's kid.

05:43.510 --> 05:47.356
It's not very helpful, to be honest.
The kid has disappeared...

05:47.547 --> 05:49.424
...until now.

05:50.383 --> 05:53.421
Now, is there anything else
you can remember about the case?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.223
Any names you can think of?

05:55.755 --> 06:00.568
No. Like I told the police, it was
so long ago. Look, I'm sorry.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.271
All right. Here's the thing.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.706
We talked to the other victim on
the way here. The stenographer.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.942
She said the attacker didn't let her go
until she gave up a name.

06:14.441 --> 06:15.886
Your name.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.453
Okay.

06:17.777 --> 06:21.748
But what does that have to do with me
being attacked in my own home here?

06:21.948 --> 06:26.055
- What name did you give up?
- Look, I told you everything I told the police.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.460
This woman comes here,
beats the tar out of me.

06:28.688 --> 06:32.602
But there's no name to give up, so I don't
know what else... Hey, what are you doing?

06:32.792 --> 06:35.466
- Talk, you son of a bitch.
- I'm the victim here.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.935
Talk!

06:39.132 --> 06:41.408
Okay. Okay.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.306
All right. All right.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.318
After the files were sealed...

06:57.984 --> 06:58.985
...I pushed.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.599
- And they offered me money, a lot of money.
- Give me a name.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.101
The money kept coming in
from overseas accounts.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.331
- Give me a name!
- I will be disbarred!

07:11.998 --> 07:15.343
That'll be the least to your worries,
I promise you that.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.185
Councilwoman Barbara Cordry.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.366
Celeste Middleton.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.295
Celeste.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.699
That's Charlie's real name.

07:42.262 --> 07:47.143
I guess she's looking after the person
who, uh, destroyed her family.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.540
Can you blame her?

07:52.005 --> 07:56.385
We just gotta find her before she does
something nobody can walk away from.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.632
- Barbara Cordry?
- Can I help you?

08:15.829 --> 08:19.003
Yes. I'm Special Agent Gabriel.
My partner, Special Agent Collins.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.372
- May we come in?
- What's this about?

08:21.568 --> 08:23.980
We have some questions
about a drunk-driving case...

08:24.170 --> 08:26.081
...involving the Middleton family.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.547
I have no idea what you're talking about.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.883
- Ma'am, if we could just...
- Sorry, I'm still on vacation.

08:33.078 --> 08:37.424
Feel free to schedule an appointment with
my assistant. Shell pencil you both in.

08:42.087 --> 08:45.069
- Guilty much?
- Yeah.

08:55.735 --> 08:57.442
What the hell is kale?

08:57.704 --> 09:01.777
"Anti-authority disorder,
clinical depression, violent outbursts."

09:02.042 --> 09:06.422
- Charlie was, uh...
- Dude, if a shrink interviewed us at that age...

09:06.613 --> 09:10.755
...you think the report would be
all kittens and rainbows? Come on.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.619
She's a good kid.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.264
There's gotta be an explanation for
this, man. There's just gotta be.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.151
Should've known Rocket and Groot
would track me down.

09:45.618 --> 09:46.619
Let her go.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.089
Who?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.470
Oh, her?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.670
- Don't do this.
- I just want answers.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.273
Since when do you start pounding
on people for those?

09:58.465 --> 10:01.742
- What the hell happened to you in Oz?
- Everything I wanted.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.414
An adventure.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.611
Even got my own little sword.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.845
- Charlie...
- Oh, Sam, you're adorable.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.656
You're not gonna hurt me.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.486
In fact, that's your problem.

10:15.682 --> 10:18.424
All good-guy code, no bite.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.696
What a waste.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.991
And you.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.500
Always letting this
albatross hold you back.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.037
Okay, all right. You know what?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.499
I don't know what's going on here, okay?

10:31.698 --> 10:33.541
But this, this is not you.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.143
Oh, it's me, all right.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.713
Charlie, put the knife down. Let her go.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.214
We don't wanna hurt you, kiddo,
but we're not gonna let you do this.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.657
Charlie, stop.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.889
No, no.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.328
Crap.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.135
Sam.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.471
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.581
- What did she say to you?
- She... She wanted the bank statements.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.219
Charlie. Hey.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.658
You son of a bitch.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.771
What's up, bitches?

11:46.105 --> 11:47.709
Right. Um, heh...

11:47.907 --> 11:50.513
We should probably catch up.

12:01.454 --> 12:05.698
Okay, so there are two of you?
One good, one bad?

12:05.892 --> 12:09.271
Yeah, and what,
Dick You is some sort of a ninja?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.908
- She is a badass, yeah.
- Okay, hold on. Back up.

12:12.098 --> 12:15.602
We were there for Dorothy, Oz,
Yellow Brick Road, but then...?

12:15.802 --> 12:17.543
War.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.580
The war for Emerald City.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.719
It was awesome, heh.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.479
Until not so much.

12:24.711 --> 12:31.151
We were gonna lose.
So I made a deal with the Wizard. Of Oz.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.092
Wears a hood and a creepy mask,
kind of a jerk. Good times.

12:34.287 --> 12:38.292
He said for us to win,
I had to unleash my true darkness.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.303
Which he meant literally.
He used The Inner Key of Oz.

12:42.495 --> 12:46.341
It opens a door to your soul
and lets the darkness out.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.511
Uh, we're still connected physically.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.148
If you hurt her, you hurt me.

12:52.338 --> 12:56.115
But bottom line, she's bad and I'm good.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.119
And let me just tell you,
being good is really annoying.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.850
Normally, in a place like this,
I'd be pounding Harvey Wallis-angers...

13:03.082 --> 13:05.119
...and checking out the bartender's ass.

13:05.318 --> 13:09.266
Now? All I wanna do is sip club soda
and send her to college.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.860
Okay, uh, Good Charlie.

13:13.092 --> 13:17.336
So why is Dark Charlie gunning for revenge?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.100
She's trying to win me back.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.376
Dark Charlie won the war. Single-handedly.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.206
But...

13:25.471 --> 13:27.451
...she did some truly awful things.

13:27.940 --> 13:32.013
But I told her I didn't want any
part of her near me again ever.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.350
Going after the person who mur... Mun-

13:35.815 --> 13:37.351
Who took my parents away...

13:37.550 --> 13:40.656
...is her messed-up way
of showing me how close we are.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.890
Or could be.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.395
I keep calling her she, but she's me.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.476
- I'm the one doing this.
- Charlie, that's not who you are.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.306
- Okay? It's a twisted version of...
- Me.

13:59.472 --> 14:03.045
I've been following her so I can catch her
before she does something stupid...

14:03.242 --> 14:04.846
...and just lock her away forever.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.321
Charlie, that's not an answer.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.652
Sam's right.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.555
We'll go back to Oz...

14:12.752 --> 14:15.255
...and we'll get the key
from the Wizard of Douche.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.662
- And we'll put you back together.
- Even if I did want her back...

14:19.192 --> 14:20.603
Look.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.335
Dark me broke the key.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.738
There's no way to get back to the Wizard.

14:27.867 --> 14:32.009
Okay, first thing's first, we need to find Dark
Charlie before she finds the drunk driver.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.510
So we know Barbara gave up
her old bank statements, right?

14:35.708 --> 14:40.054
Dark Charlie will probably follow the money
back to whoever made the payoffs.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.956
- That's what I would do.
- All right.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.253
I'll get some refills.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.620
We need you...

14:48.221 --> 14:50.428
...to hack into Barbara's bank accounts.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.206
- I can't.
- What?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.968
It's bad. Hold you, being good is annoying.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.542
How about you guide me
through the process...

15:01.734 --> 15:04.214
...and then I'm the bad one?

15:29.729 --> 15:32.608
Okay, so Barbara's payments all came
from off-shore accounts...

15:32.799 --> 15:36.303
...which were routed through dummy
corporations which have all gone belly-up.

15:36.502 --> 15:40.416
All right, skip to the end, Dragon Tattoo.
Do they all lead back to this guy'?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.485
Russell Wellington.
And according to his personal records...

15:43.676 --> 15:47.089
...he had a car that was reported stolen
the week of the accident.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.759
A car that was never recovered.

15:48.948 --> 15:53.590
After this supposed "theft," he went
on a sabbatical from work for two weeks...

15:53.786 --> 15:57.757
...and returned to work with bruises
and a broken ankle.

16:01.427 --> 16:02.531
So this is him?

16:04.197 --> 16:06.837
This is the man who, uh...

16:08.768 --> 16:11.044
And you're done. Sam?

16:12.705 --> 16:15.049
Hey, dudes? Dudes?

16:15.274 --> 16:17.015
Secrets are bad.

16:19.545 --> 16:23.823
Charlie, I don't think you should be
anywhere around this piece-of-crap salesman.

16:24.016 --> 16:28.226
And I don't think that finding Dark Charlie
and locking her up is gonna work.

16:28.454 --> 16:32.834
I mean, she maybe dark,
but she's still a part of you.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.166
You're right.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.409
I hate it, but you're right.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.576
Okay, let's go to the Bunker.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.647
Baum used the key to Oz.
Maybe there's something...

16:46.839 --> 16:51.083
...in the Men of Letters' files about the
key. If we fix it, we can get back to Oz.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.716
You guys dig into that.

16:52.912 --> 16:56.086
I'm gonna keep an eye on Russell
and wait for Dark Charlie to show up.

16:56.315 --> 17:00.422
- You sure? Maybe I should be the one...
- No, no, no, I got it. it's...

17:00.653 --> 17:04.066
I just can't believe I have to protect
this piece of crap.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.760
You gotta protect them both.
If Dark Charlie gets hurt...

17:06.992 --> 17:09.906
So do I. So be careful.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.842
Got it.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.416
Is he okay?

17:20.606 --> 17:21.949
Uh...

17:23.910 --> 17:25.685
I'll tell you on the way. Come on.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.288
The key to quieting
your mind is minding your quiet.

17:31.851 --> 17:35.799
Know and understand.
The Jack of an answer is inex-

18:24.570 --> 18:27.176
Okay, here we go. Clive Dillon.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.250
He is the Man of Letters
that first discovered the key to Oz.

18:30.443 --> 18:35.085
So according to this incident report, Clive
went to Oz, but he left the key on Earth.

18:35.281 --> 18:39.127
And then L. Frank Baum found the key
and went to rescue Clive in Oz.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.662
That's when Dorothy snuck along
and got stuck there.

18:41.854 --> 18:46.667
Right. And then, after Baum rescued Clive,
Clive came back and retired.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.203
You can retire from the Men of Letters?

18:49.428 --> 18:52.875
Well, apparently, they put him
in some sort of Witness Relocation Program.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.876
Where did he end up?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.642
Let's find out.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.108
Mr. Presley?

19:05.011 --> 19:06.388
Mr. Presley?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.126
Yes. Yeah, hi.

19:09.315 --> 19:13.161
Uh, actually, I'm, you know,
really into this article on, uh...

19:15.287 --> 19:16.288
...mammograms.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.831
Riveting stuff.
If somebody else wants to go...

19:22.395 --> 19:25.001
Right. Yes, okay. Well...

19:25.564 --> 19:27.407
Let's do this.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.208
Mr. Presley for you, sir.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.080
Is that it for the day?

19:33.305 --> 19:35.182
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, you can head out.

19:35.374 --> 19:38.583
Uh, I need my dry cleaning taken
to the lake house.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.690
And pick up Pepper
and take her to the dog groomers, okay?

19:42.248 --> 19:43.522
Yes, sir.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.423
Thank you.

19:45.651 --> 19:48.188
Mr. Presley.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.762
Russell Wellington. Please, have a seat.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.097
So...

19:56.429 --> 19:59.205
...what can you tell me
about what you're looking for today?

19:59.398 --> 20:02.675
Ah. Right. Well, uh...

20:03.169 --> 20:06.082
Let me describe my dream home.

20:06.772 --> 20:11.346
The Men of Letters gave Clive a new name,
new house, both of which are still listed.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.218
I think Clive might still be alive.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.428
Well, he'd be like a hundred something.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.789
Time passes differently in Oz.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.589
It's close by, let's go look.

20:21.787 --> 20:25.633
If he's still kicking, he's the only person
who might be able to fix the key to Oz.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.633
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

20:33.466 --> 20:40.076
I'm not saying that I have to have a Jacuzzi,
I'm just saying that I really like bubbles.

20:40.272 --> 20:43.253
Mr. Presley,
look, I'm just gonna stop you right there.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.286
Judging from your cheap shoes
and your faded jeans...

20:46.479 --> 20:50.291
...I'm guessing the only house
you're in the market for comes with wheels.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.485
I'm a busy man.
My time is extremely valuable.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.925
I prefer not to have it wasted
by some hayseed.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.964
I'm willing to buy if
you're willing to sell.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.468
So why don't you show me what you got?

21:01.660 --> 21:04.004
Well, I can show you the door.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.679
Who the hell do you think you are?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.473
I'm the guy who's gonna save your life.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.743
- Excuse me?
- Hill and Oak Street.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.784
Station wagon with a man and a woman...

21:18.010 --> 21:22.686
...on their way to pick up their little daughter
from a slumber party. That ring a bell?

21:23.849 --> 21:28.025
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No. You were too drunk to remember.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.359
I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

21:30.589 --> 21:31.795
Or somebody that cares?

21:32.124 --> 21:36.266
Or maybe somebody who wouldn't pay
people off to cover up manslaughter?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.032
You're insane.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.812
What the hell is going on?

21:43.469 --> 21:46.348
Stay here. Do not leave this room.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.659
Charlie.

22:07.193 --> 22:08.968
Let's talk about this.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.142
You Winchester boys and your talk.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.811
Blah, blah, blah, repressed feelings.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.345
Blah, blah, blah, passive aggression.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.414
Come on, kiddo, you don't wanna do this.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.022
I don't wanna hurt him.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.486
I just wanna talk.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.591
Yeah, like you talked to all the others?

22:31.750 --> 22:33.423
You're right.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.026
I got out of hand.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.595
But this was never about revenge.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.736
Right.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.533
I want him to see my face.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.940
I want him to see what he did to me.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.909
To us.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.044
That's all.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.183
Please, Dean.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.454
I deserve that.

23:02.047 --> 23:06.257
And then we hand him over to the cops.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.132
Okay.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.648
Mister...

23:31.644 --> 23:33.590
Celeste.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.251
No one's called me that
in a long, longtime.

23:43.389 --> 23:46.996
I am so sorry.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.835
What I did...

23:50.663 --> 23:52.768
I was young, I was stupid.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.740
What I took, I...

23:55.567 --> 23:57.342
I can never give back to you.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.908
But what I did after the accident,
that never should have happened.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.986
And I wasn't drunk for that.
I was stone-cold sober.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.849
It was selfish.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.819
And wrong.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.292
And I should pay for it.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.958
And I will pay for it.

24:20.192 --> 24:23.605
You took everything from me.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.538
Please.

24:27.499 --> 24:30.844
Celeste, I am so sorry.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.652
Russell.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.721
I forgive you.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.167
Charlie.

24:59.365 --> 25:01.242
Charlie.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.502
Don't do this, Charlie.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.337
Dean?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.710
Hey, hold on, I'm putting you on speaker.

25:41.006 --> 25:43.782
- What happened?
- It's over.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.220
- What do you mean, it's over?
- She got to Russell.

25:47.413 --> 25:50.292
- She killed him.
- Oh, my God.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.359
Charlie, if you can hear me, I'm so sorry.

25:54.086 --> 25:57.033
It's not your fault. It's mine.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.896
No, no, no, don't say that.
This is not on you.

26:00.092 --> 26:04.563
- All right, let's try and stick to the plan,
Did you guys find a way back to Oz?

26:05.064 --> 26:09.774
Maybe. Look, the Man of Letters who
originally found the key, he's still alive.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.574
He lives in Junction City
under the name Michael Carter.

26:12.771 --> 26:16.810
- I'll text you the address. Just some
All right. I am on my way.

26:26.452 --> 26:29.058
Are you gonna stare at that all night?

26:30.055 --> 26:32.228
I'm pacing myself.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.973
She's cute.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.242
- You lied to me.
- You lied to yourself.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.248
That's kind of your move.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.521
Somethings off about you, though, isn't it?

26:53.245 --> 26:56.124
- It's always something with you boys...
- I made mistakes.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.919
But I'll pay for mine.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.927
- And you'll pay for yours.
- Come on, Dean.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.533
I'm not the monster here. He was.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.600
He got what he deserved.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.328
You know I'm right.

27:09.428 --> 27:12.204
You know what I learned about being dark?

27:12.431 --> 27:14.342
It sets you free.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.841
And part of you knows that's right too.

27:27.779 --> 27:30.521
- Hello.
- Clive Dillon?

27:31.783 --> 27:33.285
No. My name is...

27:33.485 --> 27:36.557
Michael Carter, right.
But it was Clive Dillon, wasn't it?

27:37.289 --> 27:39.963
Back in the Men of Letters? Back in Oz?

27:40.159 --> 27:43.504
You seem to be confused.
There's no Clive Dillon here.

27:43.695 --> 27:44.696
And Oz?

27:46.064 --> 27:48.305
Well, that's just a fairy tale.

27:48.500 --> 27:54.246
- Best left on the bookshelves where it belongs.
- So you've never seen this before?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.892
Enjoy.

28:09.922 --> 28:10.922
Delicious.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.069
All right, listen, Dark Charlie...

28:13.258 --> 28:15.204
Oh, grow up.

28:15.527 --> 28:20.374
There's no right, there's no wrong.
There is just us and them.

28:20.566 --> 28:24.378
Yeah. Well, there's not gonna be a you
for very much longer.

28:24.570 --> 28:28.040
Uh-oh. Did Princess Me
find a way back to Oz'?

28:28.240 --> 28:29.719
That's right.

28:29.908 --> 28:33.378
Yeah, a former Men of Letters retired
in Grantville, two towns over.

28:33.579 --> 28:36.355
They're gonna fix the key to Oz,
find the Wizard...

28:36.548 --> 28:38.755
...and put you back to where you belong.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.225
Back into Charlie?

28:41.687 --> 28:43.428
Is that where I belong?

28:45.891 --> 28:46.892
Well...

28:51.897 --> 28:54.275
We'll just see, won't we?

28:54.933 --> 28:56.810
In the meantime...

28:58.937 --> 29:03.909
...if you're not gonna ask her to dance,
then I will.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.403
Huh.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.812
- What happened, my friend strike out?
- Your friend?

29:30.435 --> 29:32.108
She just left out the back door.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.154
No, no, no.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.693
You son of a bitch.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.291
Damn it.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.694
- Sam?
- Hey.

29:56.161 --> 29:57.469
Where the hell are you?

29:57.663 --> 29:59.768
Dick Charlie just hotwired Baby.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.104
- She thinks she's on her way to you.
- What?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.214
I told her the wrong town,
so probably bought you a little time.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.646
But, uh, just be on the lookout.
I'll be there as soon as I can jack a ride.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.183
Thanks. Hurry.

30:11.677 --> 30:14.886
The Six Keys of Oz were forged
from Oz Steel.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.691
They can only be repaired
in that magical realm.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.659
So there's no going back?

30:22.888 --> 30:24.731
I can't put my darkness away?

30:24.956 --> 30:26.230
I'm sorry.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.972
- What happened to you in Oz?
- It's in my report.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.870
Your report just said you were kidnapped.
By whom?

30:34.132 --> 30:36.043
Bad people.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.406
I know that look.

30:39.971 --> 30:41.712
You're lying. And lying is...

30:41.907 --> 30:44.751
Bad. Yes, I know.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.858
What happened to you, my dear,
happened to me.

30:49.047 --> 30:52.153
- What?
- A coven of witches grabbed me.

30:52.351 --> 30:56.493
They used the Inner Key on me.
Unleashed my id.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.058
He was awful.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.736
He killed all the witches
and went into a tantrum.

31:02.928 --> 31:07.377
He's power hungry. Crazy.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.570
He became the Wizard of Oz.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.516
Frank's daughter Dorothy
runs Emerald City now.

31:16.708 --> 31:21.384
The Wizard, Dark You, he's right
by her side. If she's in trouble...

31:21.580 --> 31:26.427
Well, without the key to Oz, there is
no way we can get back to the Wizard.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.719
But...

31:27.919 --> 31:29.523
But...

31:29.955 --> 31:32.765
...there may well be a way...

31:32.958 --> 31:35.962
...to summon him here.

31:46.571 --> 31:51.645
If I am mortally wounded, he'll have
to come back here to save us both.

31:51.877 --> 31:55.654
- Wait, wait, wait, there has to be another
What he has done is my fault.

31:55.881 --> 32:00.261
After all, he is me. And I am him, $0...

32:02.587 --> 32:06.125
Maybe it's time that both of us
answered for our sins.

32:07.058 --> 32:09.595
It's the good thing to do, right?

32:10.629 --> 32:12.233
Right?

32:32.284 --> 32:36.255
Figured you'd lie about where to go next.
That's what I would do.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.298
What the hell do you want?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.970
- I just wanna talk to her.
- You're not going near her.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.763
I'm not gonna let you corrupt her.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.962
Corrupt her?

32:44.162 --> 32:48.508
- Take one more step, I'm gonna put you down.
- There's the Dean I love.

33:22.868 --> 33:25.474
What have you done, you fool?

33:41.720 --> 33:46.499
stay alive.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.932
- And you couldn't even manage that.
- Ow!

33:54.599 --> 33:57.079
You hit like a girl
who never learned how to hit.

34:14.619 --> 34:16.929
That's it, big boy. Let it all out.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.601
Stop this. Please.

34:26.797 --> 34:27.969
Let me help my friend.

34:29.634 --> 34:31.875
Your friend wanted to be a hero.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.572
And you know what happens to heroes?

34:34.773 --> 34:36.581
They die.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.453
You hurt my friend.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.962
I learned it by watching you.

35:07.172 --> 35:08.480
I'm sorry.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.150
I forgive you.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.513
We both do.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.631
Charlie?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.469
Hang on.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.535
Hey, you okay?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.141
Dean. Dean.

36:08.566 --> 36:10.204
You did it, didn't you?

36:12.370 --> 36:14.543
You killed the Wizard.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.419
I knew it.

36:19.544 --> 36:22.354
The magic was in you all the time...

36:24.082 --> 36:25.720
...Celeste.

37:09.594 --> 37:10.800
Charlie?

37:11.096 --> 37:15.476
Charlie, hey. I got you. it's okay.

37:16.267 --> 37:18.144
It's okay.

37:46.231 --> 37:48.404
Yeah, he's, uh, better.

37:48.633 --> 37:52.513
I mean, he's calmed down now.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.646
Cass, we gotta...

37:54.839 --> 37:57.319
We gotta find Cain, or...

37:57.509 --> 38:00.183
...we gotta find something, you know?

38:01.179 --> 38:02.658
Right.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.620
Oh, yeah, no, I hear you. Okay.

38:05.817 --> 38:09.128
You got it. All right. Thanks.

38:14.692 --> 38:15.693
Hey.

38:16.861 --> 38:19.000
Shouldn't you be resting up?

38:19.197 --> 38:22.144
I think sleeping for two days in a row
is probably enough.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.509
So are you...?

38:27.705 --> 38:30.345
Good? Bad'?

38:31.376 --> 38:33.720
I think I'll just settle for balanced.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.621
Anything about the Mark?

38:41.820 --> 38:44.357
Yeah, maybe. I found this book.
It's a lore book.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.365
- Book of The Damned.
- Sounds legit.

38:46.558 --> 38:50.700
It's in a library somewhere in Tuscany, and
it might be a dead end, but I figured...

38:50.895 --> 38:52.533
- I'll go check it out.
- Oh...

38:52.730 --> 38:55.301
Look, there's no going back to Oz.

38:55.533 --> 38:58.912
And with the Wizard gone,
Dorothy will be fine.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.877
So does this mean no more adventure?

39:03.474 --> 39:06.546
I think we have all the adventure
that we can handle right here.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.753
- What about...?
- Dark Charlie?

39:11.316 --> 39:13.227
She's, uh...

39:13.885 --> 39:15.831
...quiet.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.097
Just gotta keep moving forward.

39:25.930 --> 39:27.204
We all do.

39:36.274 --> 39:39.414
- Charlie...
- We are going to fix this.

39:39.611 --> 39:42.251
I'm not letting what happened to me
happen to you.

39:42.447 --> 39:45.621
- But it's already happened.
- Cain found a way to live with it.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.126
Right. Yeah, after centuries of murder.

39:48.353 --> 39:51.425
Yeah, well, there's one thing
that you have that he didn't.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.903
You're a Winchester.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.232
I forgive you, Dean.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.610
Yeah, well, I don't.

40:04.802 --> 40:07.248
I know. That's kind of your move.

40:09.307 --> 40:10.945
How's that working out for you, huh?

40:16.147 --> 40:18.491
I'm so sorry, kiddo.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.993
Then prove it.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.011
Be careful out there.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.982
Does that sound like either of me?

40:48.846 --> 40:50.348
If I find something, I'll call.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.355
If not...

40:52.850 --> 40:54.989
...I'll just keep digging.

40:56.421 --> 40:58.367
Charlie, thank you.

40:58.823 --> 41:00.530
Arrivederci, bitches.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.046
You good?

41:14.005 --> 41:15.006
No.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.214
She's right, Dean.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.824
You can do this.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.617
We can do this.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.231
Then let's get to work.
