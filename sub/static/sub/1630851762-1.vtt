00:19.019 --> 00:21.006
My god!

00:21.008 --> 00:22.009
What the fuck?

00:22.011 --> 00:24.001
I didn't even
see that comin'.

00:24.003 --> 00:25.021
Kelli, you can't keep
doing that the whole trip.

00:25.023 --> 00:27.006
I will drive us
off a cliff.

00:27.008 --> 00:28.013
It's my timeline, okay?

00:28.015 --> 00:30.009
It's a Groundhog's Day
of fuckshit.

00:30.011 --> 00:32.003
Oof, have you seen
Molly's page?

00:32.005 --> 00:34.001
Girl, she say she fine.

00:34.003 --> 00:35.016
But then, bitch,
why you postin'

00:35.018 --> 00:37.001
all those selfies
with just

00:37.003 --> 00:38.015
the corner of your face?

00:38.017 --> 00:40.007
Lookin' like a Picasso.

00:40.009 --> 00:41.013
It's been two months.

00:41.015 --> 00:42.018
She's really goin'
through it.

00:42.020 --> 00:45.008
I do like
her inspirational
quotes, though.

00:45.010 --> 00:47.016
"Stars can't shine
without darkness."

00:47.018 --> 00:49.012
- That's not not deep.
Right?

00:49.014 --> 00:50.014
You know what,
I get it

00:50.016 --> 00:52.003
because when I broke up
with Qwantrell,

00:52.005 --> 00:53.014
I posted so many thirst traps,

00:53.016 --> 00:55.008
my DMs still ain't recovered.

00:55.010 --> 00:57.005
They be filthy as hell.

00:57.007 --> 00:58.010
You know you could
just delete 'em.

00:58.012 --> 01:00.011
- I gotta respond.
- You definitely don't.

01:00.013 --> 01:03.011
Then maybe
I want to respond.

01:03.013 --> 01:05.001
You know what?

01:05.003 --> 01:08.008
This weekend
is supposed
to be for us.

01:08.010 --> 01:10.012
So, let's not talk
about any mess.

01:10.014 --> 01:12.003
Let's not talk
about Molly's mess,

01:12.005 --> 01:14.023
let's not talk about
Issa's messy mess.

02:21.021 --> 02:23.000
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Thank you.

02:23.002 --> 02:25.005
Hey, look who it is!

02:25.007 --> 02:27.006
It's people I see
all the time.

02:27.008 --> 02:28.003
Hey.

02:28.005 --> 02:29.004
Good to see you.

02:29.006 --> 02:30.009
- Hi, girl!
- Hey, girl.

02:31.021 --> 02:33.003
- Hey!
- Hey.

02:34.003 --> 02:36.015
Look at you,
fresh off the plane,

02:36.017 --> 02:37.014
stuntin'!

02:38.012 --> 02:39.022
And you're twinning.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.022
Oh, yeah!

02:42.000 --> 02:43.019
I usually sleep in this.

02:43.021 --> 02:46.010
Oh, gah, I don't.

02:46.012 --> 02:48.019
Ugh, I hated this nigga.

02:48.021 --> 02:52.004
- Aww, I loved this nigga.
- I did.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.018
No real feelin's
about this nigga.

02:53.020 --> 02:55.006
Um, when y'all
checked in,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.010
did y'all get
a name tag?

02:56.012 --> 02:57.018
'Cause that smiley
bitch over there

02:57.020 --> 02:58.018
sayin' I'm not
registered,

02:58.020 --> 03:00.002
and she had
to make me one.

03:00.004 --> 03:02.016
Well, I got one
because I am a panelist,

03:02.018 --> 03:04.008
so... big things!

03:04.010 --> 03:06.014
Y'all, not only did
they flew me out,

03:06.016 --> 03:08.006
but they got me
a handler, too.

03:08.008 --> 03:10.018
This is super official.
Am I official enough?

03:10.020 --> 03:12.007
Uh, yeah you are.

03:12.009 --> 03:13.014
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did someone say,

03:13.016 --> 03:15.006
-"The BLOCC"?
- Ah! Me!

03:15.008 --> 03:17.015
What does it
stand for again?

03:17.017 --> 03:19.009
Oh, just "Black Life.

03:19.011 --> 03:21.016
Opportunities.
And Cultural..."

03:21.018 --> 03:22.016
Um.

03:22.018 --> 03:24.011
I had went
back and forth
on the C's,

03:24.013 --> 03:27.013
but I, uh,
landed on, um--

03:27.015 --> 03:29.014
Actually, I forget.
Uh, lemme just look it up.

03:29.016 --> 03:31.007
Anticipation.
I love it!

03:31.009 --> 03:32.007
Connection!

03:32.009 --> 03:33.015
Black Life,
Opportunities,

03:33.017 --> 03:35.006
Culture,
and Connection.

03:35.008 --> 03:36.020
We new, but we out here.

03:36.022 --> 03:38.002
I'm gonna learn it.

03:38.004 --> 03:39.011
Well, as a Black
that loves connection,

03:39.013 --> 03:41.003
I feel covered.

03:41.005 --> 03:41.023
Are y'all good?

03:42.001 --> 03:42.020
- I stay good.
- Yeah.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.003
Shall we?
- Mm-hm.

03:44.005 --> 03:45.010
- Yeah.
Yeah, look at us.

03:45.012 --> 03:47.011
Lookin' like
a diversity brochure.

03:48.014 --> 03:50.020
It feels so good
to be back.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.002
Ya know, Dr. Rhonda
says that this is

03:52.004 --> 03:53.009
a really good opportunity

03:53.011 --> 03:54.014
for me to disconnect,

03:54.016 --> 03:57.001
and stay in the moment.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.018
I don't know that
I know how to do that,
but I'm gon' try.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.002
I'm glad you're
tryin', girl.

04:02.004 --> 04:03.022
Oh, shit.
Is that Jordanna?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.001
Did she have another kid?

04:05.003 --> 04:06.015
She brought all her kids.

04:06.017 --> 04:08.022
- Should we have brought Simone?
- Think we did it right, babe.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.019
This weekend is
for us, remember?

04:10.021 --> 04:12.008
Oh,

04:12.010 --> 04:13.017
- shit!
- Hold up.

04:13.019 --> 04:15.005
Is that Kelli?

04:16.008 --> 04:18.004
What the fuck?

04:19.012 --> 04:21.008
They killed me!

04:21.010 --> 04:24.023
Oh, is that why they
asked me to say a few words?

04:25.001 --> 04:28.008
"Kelli will always
be Kelli. Laughs."

04:28.010 --> 04:29.021
Why'd they put
my laugh in there?

04:29.023 --> 04:32.016
I mean, I did laugh,
but that's 'cause,

04:32.018 --> 04:33.021
you do be you.

04:35.016 --> 04:36.021
I do.

04:36.023 --> 04:38.014
Oh, shit.

04:38.016 --> 04:41.011
Maybe it's a good time
to get up off the grid.

04:41.013 --> 04:43.003
'Cause I do have
some other identities

04:43.005 --> 04:44.019
I've been meaning
to try out.

04:44.021 --> 04:46.015
- What's the first one?
- French.

04:46.017 --> 04:47.014
- Okay.

04:47.016 --> 04:48.023
Uh-huh-huh.

04:49.001 --> 04:50.023
Is-is that--
is that an identity,

04:51.001 --> 04:52.012
or is that a language?

04:52.014 --> 04:53.021

Hey!

It's so good

05:15.005 --> 05:17.016

had your issues,

05:19.023 --> 05:22.012
how long did it
take for you guys
to get back-back?

05:22.014 --> 05:24.020
Oh, god.
We were fake-back
before we were back-back.

05:24.022 --> 05:28.012
I mean, child,
the jokes I laughed at that
weren't even funny. Whew.

05:28.014 --> 05:30.012
Tiff do be strugglin'
with them punchlines.

05:30.014 --> 05:32.000

05:36.015 --> 05:38.002
What makes her scared?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.009
What makes her hair grow?

05:39.011 --> 05:41.000
Is she a night walker,
or is she a night talker?

05:41.002 --> 05:43.002
Do she still got
both her big toes?

05:43.004 --> 05:44.006
'Cause I ain't
never seen 'em,

05:44.008 --> 05:46.012
but I never look.
The point is...

05:46.014 --> 05:48.007
just give it time.

05:49.008 --> 05:51.004
Thanks. This was, um,

05:51.022 --> 05:52.022
worse.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.022
Bye, Bebe.
- Okay, girl.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.003
I will never forget Bebe
grindin' up on Derek

05:57.005 --> 05:58.020

on the Quad.

since day one
y'all were a couple.

06:05.007 --> 06:07.014
Everyone except
thirsty-ass Bebe,
apparently.

06:07.016 --> 06:09.016
Whoever she is.

06:09.018 --> 06:11.000
She was thirsty.

06:11.002 --> 06:12.016
Parched.

06:12.018 --> 06:14.002
Like a shriveled-up prune.

06:14.004 --> 06:16.018
Ha, ha! Prune!

06:16.020 --> 06:18.022
It's a lifelong journey, girl.
- Mm-hm.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.015
C'mon, you never
had to worry
about anyone else.

06:21.017 --> 06:23.003
I mean,
after our first date,

06:23.005 --> 06:25.007
I carved our names
into a damn tree.

06:25.009 --> 06:28.002
Um, what tree?
No, you did not.

06:28.004 --> 06:29.009
Wow, you don't
remember.

06:29.011 --> 06:31.018
I'mma find that tree.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.020

Ah. Ah.

07:09.018 --> 07:10.016
It sure is.

too crazy for me.

of y'all little rap group?

07:18.010 --> 07:20.005
Ain't never
seen the trap.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.010
But I had a cousin.

07:21.012 --> 07:23.007
Didn't y'all have
a falling out?

07:23.009 --> 07:26.003
Uh-huh. I mean, if we did,
it was probably
over somethin' stupid.

07:26.005 --> 07:28.003
Yeah.
No, wait, y'all.

07:28.005 --> 07:31.009
She left early to go dance
on tour with Ciara.

07:31.011 --> 07:33.003
- That's right!
- Yes.

07:33.005 --> 07:34.014
- We should go say "hi."
- Okay.

07:34.016 --> 07:36.007
Y'all got that.
I'mma go mingle.

07:36.009 --> 07:37.021
- All right.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.004
Ahh!

08:10.021 --> 08:13.004
- Okay.
- Just did a video with Saweetie.

08:13.006 --> 08:14.004
What?!

08:14.006 --> 08:16.023
I love her.
She be eatin' good.

Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

08:22.004 --> 08:23.022
They thought you
was dead, too?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.023
Girl, no.
I snuck in this place.

08:26.001 --> 08:27.018
Y'all know me.
I ain't about to pay

08:27.020 --> 08:28.023
for none of this shit.

08:29.001 --> 08:30.014
- A motherfuckin' G.
- That's right.

08:32.004 --> 08:33.006
Hold on, Kelli.

08:33.008 --> 08:35.009
But do you still
got it, though.

08:35.011 --> 08:37.003
Do you still got it?

08:37.005 --> 08:39.018
I think you mean,
do I still...

08:39.020 --> 08:41.012
- got it!

08:42.022 --> 08:44.023
I see you.

08:45.001 --> 08:46.014
I love this bitch!

08:46.016 --> 08:48.003
Yes!

08:48.005 --> 08:50.017
I love her too,
but I can't kick.

08:50.019 --> 08:52.008
I'mma go get
in the drink line.

08:52.010 --> 08:54.005
Okay.

08:54.007 --> 08:56.000
No one even showed up
because y'all said

08:56.002 --> 08:57.003
it started at bedtime,

08:57.005 --> 08:58.019
and then they got busted.

08:59.021 --> 09:02.003
Yo, man,
we got clowned
for that.

09:02.005 --> 09:03.019
We should've left
the pajama parties
to the Omegas.

09:03.021 --> 09:05.022
Uh-uh.
The Omega
pajama parties

09:06.000 --> 09:07.005
always smelt
like ass.

09:07.007 --> 09:08.019
Them dudes stunk.
It was like walking

09:08.021 --> 09:10.003
dead into a bootyhole.

09:10.005 --> 09:12.023
Right?
- Ass-crack
smellin'-ass niggas.

09:13.001 --> 09:15.006
Strollin' all hard,
stankin'.
They're like...

09:15.008 --> 09:16.015
- Ahh!

09:16.017 --> 09:17.018
Ain't nobody want that.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.007
Uh, well, this was fun.

09:22.009 --> 09:24.004
Omari's divorced now.

09:25.003 --> 09:26.012
Bye, guys.

09:28.008 --> 09:30.003
What--
What the fuck was that?

09:30.005 --> 09:32.003
They've been plannin'
to leave us alone
for a minute.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.021
I guess they don't want you
to let me get away again.

09:35.023 --> 09:38.003
I'm sorry.
Let-- let you
get away again?

09:38.005 --> 09:39.020
- Mm-hm.
- What I remember is that

09:39.022 --> 09:41.014
we were friends with benefits,
and I was the only one

09:41.016 --> 09:43.006
- providing the benefits.
- Oh, c'mon.

09:43.008 --> 09:45.020
I like to think
I provided some benefits, too.

09:45.022 --> 09:47.012
You know what? You did.

09:47.014 --> 09:50.004
Your twin mattress,
and dates in the dining hall.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.005
I was broke back then.

09:52.007 --> 09:55.004
And there's a lot of stuff
we still don't know
about each other.

09:55.022 --> 09:56.022
Oh, really?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.012
- Yeah.
- Like what?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.001
I have a king mattress now.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.008
We'll miss you, Ron.
They should name

10:03.010 --> 10:04.021
a building after him.

10:04.023 --> 10:06.008
He was fine.

10:07.016 --> 10:09.007
Sorry you dead, white lady.

10:13.001 --> 10:14.014
What the fuck?

10:16.002 --> 10:17.023
"She had the best
stanky leg."

10:18.001 --> 10:20.006
And "always carried
a purse."

10:20.008 --> 10:22.005
Who would remember that and why?

10:22.007 --> 10:25.003
<i>This one goes out
to Kelli Prenny!</i>

10:29.012 --> 10:31.013

10:58.003 --> 10:59.008
Is that me?

10:59.010 --> 11:01.012
Oh, shit.
Throwback me?

11:01.014 --> 11:03.010
I forgot how cute
I looked with twists.

11:03.012 --> 11:05.021
No, but this new look
is workin' for us, too.

11:05.023 --> 11:07.007
You like this?

11:07.009 --> 11:08.017
Yo, we got our braces off?

11:08.019 --> 11:11.023
Let me see them teeth.

11:12.001 --> 11:13.014
- Ah!
- Let me see them teeth.

11:13.016 --> 11:15.002
- Ah!
- Show me how you eat.

11:15.004 --> 11:16.005
- Ah!

11:16.007 --> 11:17.008
We stupid.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.016
So, what are you--
- Oh...

11:18.018 --> 11:19.014
No, you go 'head.

11:21.007 --> 11:22.014
So, what are you doing here?

11:22.016 --> 11:24.005
No, uh, it's our
10-year reunion,

11:24.007 --> 11:26.017
and Stanford asked me
to speak on a panel.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.000
I knew we'd
be a big deal.

11:29.002 --> 11:31.013
Yes! Okay, so what else?

11:31.015 --> 11:33.013
Did we meet T-Pain yet?

11:33.015 --> 11:37.000
Nappy Boy, ooh-wee!
Them locks. Mm!

11:37.002 --> 11:39.009
No, girl.
But we still got time,

11:39.011 --> 11:42.009
and he is still fine, okay?

11:42.011 --> 11:44.004
Well, do we have any man?

11:45.001 --> 11:47.015
Girl, it's complicated.

11:47.017 --> 11:49.021
Oh, like the Facebook status?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.017
Okay, well, I know you're
a big-time lawyer now.

11:52.019 --> 11:54.016
Did you and Molly start
a firm together?

11:54.018 --> 11:57.002
No, I never really
wanted to be a lawyer.

11:57.004 --> 11:58.013
- You know this.
- I know this.

11:58.015 --> 12:01.017
Well, as long as you
and Molly still gully,
fa-shizzle.

12:01.019 --> 12:05.001
Yeah, we're in a good place.
We're bein' good to each other.

12:05.003 --> 12:05.022
Mmm.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.004
No, I, I actually started, uh,

12:08.006 --> 12:09.011
my own company.

12:09.013 --> 12:10.019
I see you CEO!

12:10.021 --> 12:12.022
Right?! It's called
The BLOCC.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.023
Black Life, Opportunity...

12:16.001 --> 12:18.005
Com-- fuck!

12:18.007 --> 12:19.022
Maybe I should
write it on my hand.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.010
- You'll get it.
- I'll get it.

12:21.012 --> 12:24.020
Okay, well, lemme see
what them abs talkin' 'bout.

12:24.022 --> 12:26.005
I see you, crop top.

12:26.007 --> 12:28.011
- Ooh, sorry.

12:29.004 --> 12:30.018
What you think?

12:30.020 --> 12:33.018
Aw, man. Where did I go wrong?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.003
Shut up.
Look at you.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.000
Jamel's cheatin' on you.

12:37.002 --> 12:38.009
- He is?

12:38.011 --> 12:40.003
Issa, we goin' to eat.
You hungry?

12:40.005 --> 12:42.008
Uh, yeah,
I'll be there
in a minute.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.008
- Aye.
- Hm?

12:43.010 --> 12:44.008
Photos on a app.

12:44.010 --> 12:46.019
Invent that shit.
Call it Issa-gram.

12:46.021 --> 12:48.004
Okay. Yeah.

12:49.015 --> 12:51.005
- What's a app?

12:57.013 --> 13:00.000
Yeah, because being your
own boss can be draining.

13:00.002 --> 13:01.009
Anytime I was
feelin' down,

13:01.011 --> 13:03.014
I would just
remind myself,
ya know,

13:03.016 --> 13:05.006
"Damn right I like
the life I live,

13:05.008 --> 13:06.010
"'cause I went from negative...

13:06.012 --> 13:08.002
-...to positive."
Positive.

13:11.005 --> 13:13.004
- This nigga gets it.
- Mm.

13:13.006 --> 13:14.011
That is excellent.
Uh, we have

13:14.013 --> 13:16.009
a follow-up question

13:16.011 --> 13:17.022
What's the biggest
lesson you've learned

13:18.000 --> 13:21.013
on your journey
to launch The BLO-CC?

13:21.015 --> 13:23.021
Uh, probably, that I

13:23.023 --> 13:26.021
blew it with the logo.

13:26.023 --> 13:30.003
'Cause it's not
the BLO-CC.
It's The BLOCC.

13:34.009 --> 13:37.002
No, but I learned

13:37.004 --> 13:38.011
to be authentic

13:38.013 --> 13:40.012
in merging

13:40.014 --> 13:42.009
your ideas
with your passions.

13:42.011 --> 13:43.023
I have so much
pride in my city,

13:44.001 --> 13:46.007
and that's what
drives me.

- Let it be known then.

14:02.010 --> 14:04.002
- Woo!
- Yeah!

14:04.004 --> 14:07.012
Tupac Shakur. Poet Laureate
of our hip-hop times.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.014
Nadia, same question.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.009
Okay. Well, first off,

14:11.011 --> 14:13.009
what a beautiful
singing voice, Issa.

14:13.011 --> 14:14.014
Thank you.

14:14.016 --> 14:16.006
But I would
probably say that

14:16.008 --> 14:18.005
the biggest lesson
I've learned is

14:18.007 --> 14:19.009
you have to believe

14:19.011 --> 14:20.013
and invest in yourself,

14:20.015 --> 14:21.021
because people
are investing in you

14:21.023 --> 14:24.005
just as much as they're
investing in your company.

14:26.003 --> 14:27.004
That's good.

14:27.006 --> 14:28.018
I mean, come on.

14:28.020 --> 14:30.011
That was excellent.

14:30.013 --> 14:32.005
And for our

14:32.007 --> 14:34.023
uh, entrepreneurship can
be full of ups and downs.

14:35.001 --> 14:38.016
At what point did
you each start to feel
a sense of stability?

14:38.018 --> 14:42.003
You know, when did you know
that you were on the right path?

14:42.005 --> 14:43.019
Hm, I don't know, um,

14:43.021 --> 14:47.009
I mean, probably when
I got my first round
of funding, yeah.

14:50.012 --> 14:51.011
Uh, for me,

14:51.013 --> 14:53.012
it would definitely
be when, um,

14:53.014 --> 14:56.020
people started slidin'
in my DMs asking me
for career advice.

14:56.022 --> 14:59.018
You know, I remember
when I finally quit
my tutoring job.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.018
I've never felt that much joy.

15:06.005 --> 15:09.005
Uh, the right path, um...

15:13.010 --> 15:15.023
I don't know that
I'm on the right path.

15:16.001 --> 15:17.018
To be honest, there's--

15:17.020 --> 15:21.009
there's no way to be sure
you've made the right choice.

15:23.010 --> 15:26.016
Maybe I'll wake up
tomorrow, and...

15:26.018 --> 15:29.009
realize that I've
wasted all my time.

15:31.005 --> 15:33.016
And that's time I can't...

15:33.018 --> 15:35.009
really get back.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.012
Wow.

15:40.014 --> 15:42.005
I'm glad I have a 9-to-5.

15:43.023 --> 15:46.002
Well, look, this has
been so inspiring,

15:46.004 --> 15:48.019
especially with everything
going on in the world right now.

15:48.021 --> 15:50.023
Am I right?
I am right.

15:51.001 --> 15:52.022
Now let's open
it up to some Q&A.

15:54.019 --> 15:56.019
- Yes, you.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.000
You did it!

15:58.002 --> 15:59.014
Gimme your autograph.

15:59.016 --> 16:01.017
- There she is!

16:01.019 --> 16:04.008
Hey, y'all.
I'm so glad I did that.

16:04.010 --> 16:05.015
First panel of many.

16:05.017 --> 16:07.003
You live
and you learn.

16:07.005 --> 16:08.012
And I am learning.

16:08.014 --> 16:10.009
And livin'.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.023
That's better than
my dead ass.

16:12.001 --> 16:14.020
Speaking of, I'm gonna go ahead
and go to the band reunion.

16:14.022 --> 16:16.022
They probably put together
a beautiful tribute.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.022
- You know, drums,

16:19.000 --> 16:20.007
horns,

16:20.009 --> 16:21.015
flutes,

16:21.017 --> 16:23.003
oboes, coronets--

16:23.005 --> 16:24.010
Are we gonna do
all the instruments?

16:24.012 --> 16:26.000
Yes, bitch! Toot-toot.

16:26.002 --> 16:28.010
Well, me and Derek will meet
y'all after the AKA thing.

16:28.012 --> 16:30.018
- Molly, you comin'?
- Um...

16:32.018 --> 16:35.004
Yeah, I think I'm just
gonna keep it low-key.

16:35.006 --> 16:36.016
Issa, you wanna
just chill?

16:38.004 --> 16:39.016
Can we chill with drinks?

16:39.018 --> 16:41.003
Absolutely.

17:00.023 --> 17:02.004
You think
they saw us?

17:02.006 --> 17:03.017
If they did,
I'm gonna claim
their class.

17:03.019 --> 17:06.016
Black don't crack.
They don't know.

17:08.011 --> 17:10.008
Mm.

17:15.014 --> 17:18.018
It's Omari.
He been textin'.

17:18.020 --> 17:22.006
Oh, he tryna reapply for
that fuck buddy scholarship?

17:22.008 --> 17:23.022
Girl, I don't even know.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.019
But he just
got divorced.

17:25.021 --> 17:27.023
What does he even want?

17:28.001 --> 17:29.007
And why did he
get divorced?

17:29.009 --> 17:31.009
Did he fuck it up?
Did she?

17:34.004 --> 17:36.002
See? There I go.

17:36.004 --> 17:38.009
Legit was not thinkin'
about him yesterday.

17:38.011 --> 17:39.016
I'm supposed to be

17:39.018 --> 17:41.008
focused on myself,
and just...

17:41.010 --> 17:43.009
worried about
the present.

17:45.005 --> 17:47.002
The present.

17:47.004 --> 17:49.017
No time like the...

17:51.002 --> 17:52.006
You know what?

17:52.008 --> 17:55.018
What I need to do
is just stop overanalyzing.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.003
Like always.

17:57.005 --> 17:59.023
After everything with Andrew,
I've just been so...

18:00.001 --> 18:02.007
in my head.

18:07.014 --> 18:09.005
Wish I could've been
like you on that panel.

18:09.007 --> 18:11.018
- Oh, no.
- Oh, you kept it real.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.017
For better or for worse.

18:12.019 --> 18:15.016
Yeah, I kept it
a little too real.

18:15.018 --> 18:17.020
Nah, girl.
It was inspiring.

18:17.022 --> 18:19.020
I should've been
takin' notes.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.013
Aw, the Marguerite.

18:38.015 --> 18:40.010
Remember our
first trip off campus?

18:40.012 --> 18:41.011
Yeah.

18:41.013 --> 18:42.018
And them dumb-ass,
stupid-ass,

18:42.020 --> 18:45.001
white-ass parents
asked if we
were athletes.

18:45.003 --> 18:46.015
Then you cussed them
the fuck out.

18:46.017 --> 18:47.018
Sure did.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.008
That's when I knew.

18:49.010 --> 18:51.009
I was like,
"I wanna be friends
with this girl.

18:51.011 --> 18:53.005
She cusses
so eloquently."

18:53.007 --> 18:56.006
Ha! Yeah, that was
before I learned
to white-whisper.

18:57.018 --> 19:00.002
All that confidence, boy.

19:00.004 --> 19:02.000
Freshman year, we thought
we had it all figured out.

19:02.002 --> 19:05.003
We thought.

19:05.005 --> 19:07.015
I mean, even with this
panel today, I thought--

19:08.022 --> 19:11.018
I thought it was gonna
make me feel like somebody.

19:11.020 --> 19:13.022
Like I was somewhere.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.006
But all it did was
remind me of where I'm not.

19:17.009 --> 19:19.001
Sittin' up there
with the Michelle of Water,

19:19.003 --> 19:20.012
and the Barack of Coke.

19:20.014 --> 19:23.006
Girl, you had
a whole company.

19:23.008 --> 19:24.012
Barely!

19:24.014 --> 19:28.004
I'm still out here
plumbin' toilets.

19:28.006 --> 19:31.018
I'm in my 30s,
startin' a new career,

19:31.020 --> 19:34.000
still managin'
dusty-ass apartments

19:34.002 --> 19:35.017
that somebody else owns.

19:35.019 --> 19:38.011
Everything's out
of my control.

19:38.013 --> 19:41.005
Shit at home,
in my relationship,

19:41.007 --> 19:42.008
even with Lyft.

19:42.010 --> 19:44.007
I don't control
where I go.

19:44.009 --> 19:46.021
Bitch, no, I don't wanna
take you and your friends
to Palm Springs.

19:46.023 --> 19:49.005
It's Tuesday!

19:49.007 --> 19:50.016
Have you had somethin'
to eat today?

19:50.018 --> 19:51.020
No!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.008
Mmm!

19:57.007 --> 19:58.014
That is so good.

19:58.016 --> 19:59.015
So good.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.017
Tomorrow night,
if you're still in town.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.007
Man, the world
is so fucked.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.013
Are we gon' be okay?

20:23.006 --> 20:25.010
You talkin' 'bout the world,
or you talkin' 'bout us?

20:28.023 --> 20:30.009
I don't know.
I just--

20:31.017 --> 20:34.001
I just want
shit to be cool.

20:43.016 --> 20:45.016
I haven't been
to this place since--

20:45.018 --> 20:47.014
I guess since they
kicked me out.

20:47.016 --> 20:49.015
- Fuck this dumb-ass,

20:49.017 --> 20:51.004
dingy-ass,
dusty-ass place.

20:51.006 --> 20:52.022

21:26.009 --> 21:27.019
And then the trombonist
had the nerve to say

the only thing she
remembered about me

21:29.020 --> 21:31.018

allergic to kale.

Okay!

22:15.002 --> 22:16.013
Oh, cool.
That's the liquor

22:16.015 --> 22:17.021
Oh, you be knowin'.

22:22.010 --> 22:24.013
You're crazy!
Hell yeah!

22:24.015 --> 22:27.015

22:27.017 --> 22:29.003
Hey, what y'all got

22:29.005 --> 22:30.010

Oh my god. A gun.
He has a gun, Issa.

22:31.023 --> 22:33.003
- He has a gun.
- Oh my god. Oh my god. No!

22:33.005 --> 22:34.013
No, no, no, no, no.
Please, please, no!

22:34.015 --> 22:35.022
Shut up! Shut up!

22:36.000 --> 22:37.002
Look, I'll take
those bags.

22:37.004 --> 22:38.013
And gimme that watch!

22:38.015 --> 22:40.009
Okay, okay.
You can have
whatever you want.

22:40.011 --> 22:42.004
No, not the watch!
That's Cartier!

22:42.006 --> 22:43.018
- Tick-tock, bitch!
Let's go!
- Okay!

22:43.020 --> 22:45.003
And give me
your purse, too!

22:45.005 --> 22:46.006
Whatever you wanna
take from me.

22:46.008 --> 22:47.011
You can just take it.

22:47.013 --> 22:48.013
I don't need
nothin' from you.

22:48.015 --> 22:49.013
I need you
to stop bein' so

22:49.015 --> 22:51.002
- fuckin' loud!
- Okay.

22:51.004 --> 22:52.021
- Oh my god!
- Shhh!

22:52.023 --> 22:55.013
Shut the fuck up, Chey! Shit!

22:57.001 --> 22:58.014
Chey?!

23:01.005 --> 23:03.000
Fuck!

23:03.002 --> 23:04.015
- Man, come on, Brian.
Look what you did!

23:04.017 --> 23:05.021
What are you doing?

23:05.023 --> 23:06.022
Oh my god!

23:07.000 --> 23:08.005
You always doin'
the fuckin' most.

23:08.007 --> 23:10.009
Gah! Move! God damn.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.011
Well, I'm sorry, y'all.

23:14.008 --> 23:15.014
But, Molly,

23:15.016 --> 23:17.007
come up off them
shoes, please.

23:17.009 --> 23:18.020
Yep.
- What the fuck, Chey?

23:18.022 --> 23:19.023
Are you really
robbin' us right now?

23:20.001 --> 23:21.010
It ain't nothin' personal.

23:21.012 --> 23:23.018
Everybody can get it.

23:23.020 --> 23:26.009
Come on.

23:26.011 --> 23:27.020
Okay, you know what?
You want the shoes?

23:27.022 --> 23:30.006
- Mm-hmm.
- Have the shoes, Cheyenne.
Take the damn shoes.

23:30.008 --> 23:33.008
- Okay.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.008
Oh, no, no.
You keep them, Issa.
Keep them.

23:35.010 --> 23:37.014
Ha! But, hey!

23:37.016 --> 23:38.022
Ain't shit changed!

23:39.001 --> 23:41.000
Bitch!

23:44.002 --> 23:47.004
Woo! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Let's go, let's go.

23:47.006 --> 23:49.001
I forgot I hated her.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.015
All I know is when I die,

23:57.017 --> 23:59.020
I'm comin' back
to haunt everybody.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.022
What did I do?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.008
Not enough.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.017
Where's the liquor?

24:05.019 --> 24:07.017
Forget the liquor.
Where are your shoes?

24:07.019 --> 24:09.000
Where's Cheyenne?

24:09.002 --> 24:10.012
She robbed us.

24:14.021 --> 24:16.015
- What?!
- You lyin'.

24:21.009 --> 24:23.008
What the fuck?!
She really robbed--

24:23.010 --> 24:24.023
That bitch set us up!

24:25.001 --> 24:28.001
- Girl, did you see your face?

24:28.003 --> 24:29.009
Bitch, I saw yours, okay?

24:29.011 --> 24:31.004
You looked like you
were about to cry!

24:31.006 --> 24:32.009
I was scared as shit!

24:32.011 --> 24:34.005
I thought I was
about to die!

24:34.007 --> 24:36.006
Me, too!

24:36.008 --> 24:37.018
But also like
slightly turned on,

24:37.020 --> 24:39.015
because that robber
was fine!

24:39.017 --> 24:41.017
As fuck!

24:41.019 --> 24:43.011
Your horny,
lonely ass.

24:43.013 --> 24:44.018
"Whatever you want!

24:44.020 --> 24:46.018
I'll give it to you.
It's yours!"

24:47.010 --> 24:48.020
I am what I am.

24:48.022 --> 24:51.002
Why she didn't take
my shoes, though?

24:51.004 --> 24:52.020
Oh, you know why.

24:55.010 --> 24:57.009
You know why!

24:57.011 --> 25:00.006
<i>A friendship like this
doesn't come around often,</i>

25:00.008 --> 25:03.016
<i>so it's important to value
it while it's here.</i>

25:05.008 --> 25:08.006
<i>She always, always
put her friends first.</i>

25:08.008 --> 25:10.015
<i>No matter how busy she was.</i>

25:10.017 --> 25:13.001
She made me
a better person.

25:13.003 --> 25:15.015
Emotionally,
spiritually,

25:15.017 --> 25:17.004
financially.

25:17.006 --> 25:21.019
She literally cut out coupons
for me for six months.

25:21.021 --> 25:24.001
She was the true
definition of a friend.

25:24.003 --> 25:25.017
And when she
washed away
in that flood,

25:25.019 --> 25:27.017
a piece of me
washed away with her.

25:27.019 --> 25:29.001
I lost my soulmate
that day.

25:29.003 --> 25:31.019
Sorry, Derek.
But she was my ride or die.

25:31.021 --> 25:33.009
I can't even imagine
my life without her,

25:33.011 --> 25:35.012
but I know it
won't be as full.

25:37.001 --> 25:39.009
I ain't goin' nowhere, girl.
I'm right here.

25:39.011 --> 25:42.003
- We love you, Kelli Prenny.

25:42.005 --> 25:44.021
And you will always
live with us forever.

25:45.012 --> 25:47.019
To Kelli!

25:47.021 --> 25:50.006
Uck, I love y'all.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.019
Y'all are
doin' a lot.

25:51.021 --> 25:53.011
Mm-hm.

25:53.013 --> 25:56.007
Did Kelli immortalize
her love for you
in nature?

25:56.009 --> 25:57.015
Oh, so you
found the tree?

25:57.017 --> 25:58.019
Hell yeah,
I found it.

25:58.021 --> 26:00.015
That shit
practically found me.

26:00.017 --> 26:04.006
Tree was like,
"Hello. Here I am.
Like I've always been."

26:04.008 --> 26:06.002
Just presented
itself.

26:06.004 --> 26:07.008
Mm.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.002
Girl, he didn't find it.
I caught him carving

26:12.004 --> 26:13.015
our names in a new one.

26:13.017 --> 26:15.009
But we gonna let him
have this because

26:15.011 --> 26:17.004
he's been through
a lot lately.

26:17.006 --> 26:19.007
- Yeah. He has. Yeah.
- For sure.

26:19.009 --> 26:22.002
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!

26:22.004 --> 26:23.021
Hey, we missed y'all
at the party last night.

26:23.023 --> 26:25.005
Oh.

26:25.007 --> 26:27.002
Ah, that's a story.

26:27.004 --> 26:29.019
Uh-huh.
Omari was looking for you.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.019
- Oh, for real?
- Just passin' it on.

26:32.016 --> 26:33.022
All right, y'all.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.012
Right here.

26:38.004 --> 26:40.023
So, where
was the tree?

26:41.001 --> 26:42.012
Outside.

26:42.014 --> 26:44.006
Like where--
where outside?

26:44.008 --> 26:45.005
In the dirt.

26:45.007 --> 26:47.000
- Bye-bye.
- Love you!

26:47.002 --> 26:48.020
At least you're alive.

26:50.011 --> 26:51.019
Oh, shit.
Sorry, ma'am.

26:51.021 --> 26:52.019
Y'all okay.

26:52.021 --> 26:55.008
Wait.
We at ma'am status now?

26:55.010 --> 26:57.001
Wow.

26:58.005 --> 27:00.001
So...

27:00.003 --> 27:01.008
Omari.

27:02.014 --> 27:06.007
- Oh, you want my opinion?
- Yeah.

27:08.013 --> 27:10.000
To be honest,

27:10.002 --> 27:12.011
you were never trippin'
about Omari then.

27:12.013 --> 27:14.015
And you shouldn't now.

27:14.017 --> 27:16.000
He was on you.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.019
And you just went
with the flow,

27:17.021 --> 27:19.013
'cause that's how you
were about everything.

27:19.015 --> 27:21.018
That's what I loved
about you.

27:21.020 --> 27:24.013
Ya know, you just
knew you were gonna
