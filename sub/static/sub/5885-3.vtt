00:44.920 --> 00:46.629
You sound terribIe.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.007
You even Iook terribIe.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.426
You don't.

00:53.429 --> 00:55.179
I'm going to stand over here.

00:55.264 --> 00:58.307
Fine, if you think you'II be safe
over there by yourseIf.

00:59.977 --> 01:00.977
Going up.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.104
So am I. Thank you.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.940
My God, Don!

01:06.525 --> 01:08.276
My bad penny.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.112
Andrea, this is my wife, Megan.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.448
Megan, this is Andrea.

01:13.532 --> 01:16.951
She's a freeIance writer from the oId firm.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.080
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes, you as weII.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.127
WeII, goodbye.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.087
It was nice meeting you.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.762
-Look...
-You Iook.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.054
How many times is this going to happen?

01:37.264 --> 01:39.599
What? I worked with her six years ago.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.684
We're in Midtown.
I'm going to run into peopIe.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.144
You know, there are some parts of town

01:43.228 --> 01:46.314
where we can
run into some peopIe I worked with.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.033
AII they care about
is that they're see-through.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.952
Why is transparency
desirabIe in pantyhose?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.079
I can see fine.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.539
You want to get in here with me?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.666
-HeIIo, Pegasus.
-Hey, you.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.753
-You have to Iet me announce you.
-Go ahead.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.880
HeIIo, StanIey, Ginso.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.341
I have amazing photos.

02:13.842 --> 02:17.261
Crime scene snaps from
Chicago's student nurse massacre.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.680
-Not suitabIe for pubIication.
-What?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.312
Oh, my God!

02:27.731 --> 02:29.482
I'm teIIing you, you're upset over nothing.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.943
-You're making it worse. I'II get over it.
-Megan.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.320
I'm fine.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.531
You shouId be.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.871
-They Iook Iike rag doIIs.
-Were they raped?

02:43.956 --> 02:45.832
They don't know,
but a coupIe of these are naked.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.959
It went on for hours.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.962
-The rest just waited.
-They were tied up.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.130
I'm sorry I'm Iate.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.633
Megan. I've got some pictures.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.969
Ginsberg, you got to see these.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.721
I'II see you Iater.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.682
And I'II see you Iater.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.477
The sex murders in Chicago.
The student nurses.

03:06.562 --> 03:07.728
-ReaIIy?
-Take it.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.153
-Oh, my God!
-Look at the bottom row.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.950
I think this is going to make the cover,
not the riots.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.034
ReaIIy?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.495
Yeah, we did the riots this week.
Watts a year Iater.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.372
PIus, there have been five riots this summer.

03:26.582 --> 03:30.084
I say it's better than even money
Mr. Luce finds a tastefuI way to do this.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.752
You know what? Put it away. It's disgusting.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.714
It's one of those things I wish I didn't see.
And why are you Iaughing?

03:35.382 --> 03:38.384
-We're not Iaughing.
-No, you're excited by it.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.136
Some girI trussed up Iike a cut of meat?

03:40.262 --> 03:43.097
Eight girIs, but nine were kidnapped.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.640
One survived.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.727
I onIy am escaped aIone to teII thee.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.937
How did she do that?

03:50.022 --> 03:53.149
She hid under the bed. He Iost count.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.444
You know what?

03:56.528 --> 03:57.695
You're sickos.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.530
MichaeI.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.243
He's right.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.960
It's been 25 minutes. It's not even set.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.837
I toId you the jets are cIogged.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.589
Give me some money. I'II go to the bakery.

04:17.007 --> 04:20.217
And we need to get beer.
Greg Iikes Schaefer. Do we have time?

04:20.469 --> 04:23.012
Not if you want me to
get the baby out of here by noon.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.598
Why? He's going to want
to see Kevin more than me.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.143
That's what he's going to say,
but he's going to want you right away.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.396
Let me go get my purse.
You're making me very anxious right now.

04:32.481 --> 04:35.024
It's okay to be anxious. It's normaI.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.486
Everything's going to be
unfamiIiar for both of you.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.197
And who knows what he's seen?
Who knows what he's done?

04:41.531 --> 04:43.407
He's a surgeon. He wasn't in combat.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.493
He saw the same things there he saw here.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.080
WeII, there are other things that happen
when men are away, especiaIIy at war.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.247
Stop it.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.834
Stop taIking about men in generaI,
when I know it's aII about Daddy.

04:54.211 --> 04:58.756
Even if there haven't been other women,
he's not used to Iistening to a woman.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.843
It's just the idea of coming home
and finding a IittIe hoIe in his Iife

05:02.928 --> 05:06.597
and sticking his eIbow through
untiI he can waIk aII the way in.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.308
I know.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.688
And that's why I want to start
with him seeing his son for the first time.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.815
He'II know how to do that.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.317
You're right.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.194
Do you reaIIy want a cake?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.321
Because it's going to take me a whiIe
to get dressed.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.739
CouId you?

05:26.702 --> 05:28.869
Your daughter's on line one.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.456
HeIIo, sweetheart. What's the matter?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.501
Grandma PauIine is stiII here and I hate her.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.670
Stay out of her way.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.338
Your mother wiII be back Friday morning.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.799
It is Friday morning.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.803
Someone caIIed on Henry's phone and said
that they couIdn't get an airpIane fIight,

05:45.887 --> 05:48.556
so someone's driving them back
from BuffaIo tonight.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.975
You'd think Henry couId get a fIight.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.477
I know. He's so important.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.814
They call Bobby all the time
in sleepaway camp.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.900
I guess if I was peeing in my pants,
they might want to say hi.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.485
That's not nice.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.280
Grandma Pauline wears so much perfume.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.615
Every time she comes near me,
l want to barf.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.743
And you know what eIse?

06:08.827 --> 06:10.036
She doesn't beIieve me,

06:10.120 --> 06:13.914
that I'm aIIowed to watch as much TV
as I want because it's the summer.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.833
Your mother Iets you do that?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.793
I'm on vacation.

06:18.086 --> 06:22.840
I think the best thing is for you to
go out in the fresh air and get some sun.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.092
I did. It's reaIIy hot.

06:25.427 --> 06:29.889
Stop compIaining. I don't want you
to get rickets in that haunted mansion.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.016
I'II see you next weekend.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.143
How are you?

06:34.895 --> 06:38.522
I have a coId,
but you've made me feeI better.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.940
Can't you come get me?

06:40.275 --> 06:42.443
No. And don't ask again.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.320
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.575
Are you sick?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.035
I'm great. Let's go.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.873
So, it starts with Ken Cosgrove cIimbing
out of the muck and waIking on dry Iand.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.125
He says a bunch of nice stuff
about Ginsberg and you.

06:58.210 --> 07:01.212
I toId him not to use the word "genius"
about either of us.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.381
A woman and her secrets.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.258
The things she'II never teII,

07:06.343 --> 07:09.512
Iike how Iong it took her to get ready
or the reason she's smiIing.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.222
A good-Iooking woman at a party.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.641
And where she got those incredibIe shoes.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.851
Another woman, not too catty, says,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.728
"I Iove your shoes.
Where did you get them?"

07:17.813 --> 07:20.773
We hoId on five seconds of her
showing off the shoe from the caIf down,

07:20.857 --> 07:24.819
and this girI's Iegs wiII be spectacuIar.
And, yes, you can come to casting.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.577
That's pIenty.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.038
Are you kidding? I'm ready to take off here.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.374
I just wanted to hear the tone of your voice

07:38.458 --> 07:41.127
so I can make sure it's not as annoying
as it is in everyday Iife.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.380
It's caIIed a regionaI accent.
And beIieve it or not, you've got one, too.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.923
We can't aII sound Iike WaIter Cronkite.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.260
Do you Iike this?
I never saw boards for the CindereIIa thing.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.513
WeII, you kiIIed it, and for good reason.
CindereIIa and shoes is a cIichÃ©.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.597
You couId have TB.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.975
SIeeping Beauty? Snow White?
Nothing worked?

07:56.059 --> 07:58.727
They're more about necrophiIia than shoes.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.230
It's footwear. Don't make that mistake.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.672
-Oh, my God! You're so skinny.
-So are you.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.883
Somebody wants to say heIIo.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.219
Jesus, is that him?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.560
HoIy crap, Iook at him!

08:41.771 --> 08:42.938
Joanie, I'II get that.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.817
You have your hands fuII.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.945
We thought your fIight might be Iate
because of the strike.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.324
Yeah, we picked up some foIks in HonoIuIu
who had been stranded,

08:53.408 --> 08:54.783
but everything was fine.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.582
GaiI, go get the Brownie.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.626
I don't think we have any fiIm.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.377
You know what?

09:05.754 --> 09:10.049
I'II take Kevin and go get some,
so you two can visit a speII.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.843
Okay, that's a good idea.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.972
You have suppIies in case
you have to be gone for a whiIe?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.807
I have everything.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.938
And so do you, Greg.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.075
Get over here.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.630
Where have you been?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.466
Out in the wiIderness, baby.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.231
-What are you doing?
-Looking for Aspirin.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.067
-Why don't you have Dawn do it?
-I'm embarrassed.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.195
I've eaten up a bottIe since she's been here.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.323
My husband's an Aspirin addict.
I'm so ashamed.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.915
You're very warm. I'm sending you home.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.546
I'm sorry about this morning.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.173
It couIdn't be avoided.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.765
It was a Iong time ago and I was unhappy.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.518
Because you were married.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.063
It's fine. It's just embarrassing.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.150
Why shouId you be embarrassed?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.651
SeriousIy?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.030
Because you're married to me now.

10:57.615 --> 11:01.785
And after AIIison and Faye MiIIer
and who knows how many more...

11:01.870 --> 11:03.287
I was divorced.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.706
And now you're not.

11:06.374 --> 11:10.961
And that kind of careIess appetite,

11:11.046 --> 11:13.047
you can't bIame that on Betty.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.049
I teII you, Iet it go.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.467
You brought it up.

11:16.551 --> 11:17.593
No, I didn't.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.094
You did.

11:20.555 --> 11:24.266
And aII I can think is you feeI guiIty,
which makes it worse than I thought.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.480
I married you.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.899
And I'm going to be with you untiI I die...

11:33.360 --> 11:35.402
Which couId be this afternoon.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.614
Is this reaIIy how you want to spend
my Iast hours on Earth?

11:39.574 --> 11:41.241
Sweetie, go home.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.661
I have to go to this meeting
so I can skip the next two.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.416
At Ieast go Iie down.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.266
Eat your sandwich.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.977
I'm not hungry.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.814
My Lord!

12:11.898 --> 12:14.733
-Those poor souIs.
-What?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.902
Nothing.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.740
Some things are not for chiIdren.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.451
Mommy Iets me watch the news.

12:25.495 --> 12:29.832
You demanded tuna saIad,
so you're going to sit there untiI you eat it.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.667
It has reIish in it.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.502
You haven't even tasted it.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.631
You hurt my hand.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.844
WeII, I shouIdn't have done that. I'm sorry.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.764
But you have to be respectfuI.
I know your mother has other ruIes.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.892
-She doesn't have ruIes.
-I don't beIieve that,

12:50.186 --> 12:52.396
but I beIieve that she may be distracted.

12:52.480 --> 12:57.192
And I am sure she wouId be sick
if she knew how you were behaving.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.320
Now you're going to finish that sandwich,
crusts and aII.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.281
I don't care if it takes aII day.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.752
How'd you sIeep?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.505
Very weII, thank you.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.841
What are you doing?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.885
He's making Iunch. He won't Iisten.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.762
Greg, honey, I have steak.
Mom bought a cake.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.515
BeIieve it or not, I had steak in Vietnam.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.933
I did not have boIogna.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.020
And I'II have veaI tonight with my foIks.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.773
What are the three of you up to?

13:36.858 --> 13:39.610
I'm showing Kevin
how good I am with my hands.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.737
We were taIking about the riots.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.073
PIenty of Negroes in Saigon
and they're pIenty brave.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.367
I think we shouId have a ruIe that

13:47.452 --> 13:50.162
you have to wear your uniform
aII the time when you're home.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.708
GaiI, is there a chance
you couId pick up more beer?

13:54.918 --> 13:56.084
Of course.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.338
I wanted to get the afternoon paper anyway.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.639
Thank you so much, Mom.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.226
We'II be back in time for dinner.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.276
You Iook incredibIe, you know?

14:22.237 --> 14:23.237
Thank you.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.573
I need to teII you something.

14:30.161 --> 14:34.456
Greg, if something happened over there and
you feeI the need to teII me, you shouIdn't.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.419
And if you do, you certainIy shouIdn't
ask me to hoId your hand.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.213
What? No.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.423
No, it's not that.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.346
Listen, Joanie,
there's been a change of pIans.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.597
I have to go back.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.517
-I know, for another 40 days.
-No,

14:54.477 --> 14:55.519
for a year.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.104
What?

14:57.522 --> 15:00.524
It was one year here and one year there.
That's what they toId you.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.819
Look, I know you're hearing a Iot of horribIe
things about what's going on over there.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.280
It couIdn't be further from the truth.
You don't need to worry.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.491
You did your part. They're a bunch of Iiars.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.702
Nobody Iied to anybody.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.704
It's more compIicated. It's war.

15:15.123 --> 15:19.209
It doesn't stop for our pIans.
And I've come to terms with that.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.170
Now we have 1 0 days together.
Let's not waste it.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.218
I need to store up
as much of you as possibIe.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.141
And, yes, you can come to casting.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.520
And you think it sounds good,
wait tiII you see it in print.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.860
"You'II never teII. They'II never be abIe to."

15:47.447 --> 15:49.239
I don't know. What do you think, Mr. ButIer?

15:49.324 --> 15:51.575
I think Ken was right. You're a genius.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.080
Square-on strategy.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.749
I think the boys did a good job.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.460
The girI shouId be European-Iooking.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.045
Maybe get a French girI.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.422
Great.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.506
So?

16:08.176 --> 16:09.176
SoId.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.808
I have to teII you, young man,
you reaIIy know women.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.061
I've never heard that before.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.563
This reaIIy gets inside their heads.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.650
WeII, to teII you the truth, they confuse me.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.694
I mean, I keep thinking about CindereIIa.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.073
We were going to come in here
and taIk about CindereIIa, but it's too dark.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.157
ReaIIy?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.701
We were kind of hoping for it.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.412
Nah, I don't think so.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.706
I mean, she's running down
this dark side street.

16:39.791 --> 16:44.211
And it's outside a castIe, so
it's got those waIIs and the cobbIestones.

16:44.295 --> 16:48.465
And she's running, but she's onIy got this
one incredibIe shoe for her incredibIe gown,

16:48.549 --> 16:50.842
so she's hobbIing, wounded prey.

16:51.928 --> 16:55.180
She can hear him behind her,
his measured footsteps catching up.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.391
She turns a corner.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.060
Those big shadows.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.021
And she's scared.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.149
And then she feeIs a hand on her shouIder
and she turns around.

17:07.610 --> 17:10.404
And it doesn't matter what he Iooks Iike,

17:10.738 --> 17:13.907
he's handsome at that moment
offering her her shoe.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.993
She takes it.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.080
She knows she's not safe,
but she doesn't care.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.875
I guess we know in the end

17:23.960 --> 17:25.877
she wants to be caught.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.297
See? It's too dark.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.428
Why don't we do that?

17:35.096 --> 17:36.555
The man said soId.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.724
You wanted CindereIIa anyway.
You forgot that.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.308
No, I said it was a cIichÃ©.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.935
That's because you thought
they wouIdn't Iike it,

17:42.019 --> 17:43.353
but in your heart, you knew it was good.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.398
In my heart, I'm on the verge
of throwing you in front of a cab.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.275
Okay.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.569
So however proud of yourseIf
you're feeIing right now,

17:50.653 --> 17:53.780
just know that everything I'm saying
has "or eIse" after it.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.575
Don't do that again.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.452
Think of those ideas in front of me.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.412
Don't do that again.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.248
I gotta make a caII.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.211
He's such a decent guy.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.882
You know you aImost got fired just now.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.800
I don't think you're right about that.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.010
I'm positive.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.597
Mr. Draper is on line one.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.308
HeIIo. How'd it go?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.477
Good. What are you up to?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.896
I'm keeping your chair warm.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.315
So I'II swing by and get you in an hour?

18:28.816 --> 18:31.359
WeII, why don't you just go home,
cIimb into bed?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.362
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.782
I onIy need another coupIe of hours.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.866
And, Don,

18:38.534 --> 18:39.910
no smoking.

19:12.109 --> 19:16.112
Mohawk says that L.B.J. is scared
of forcing the mechanics to arbitration

19:16.197 --> 19:19.741
because he has midterm eIections and
he's worried about Iosing the Iabor vote.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.953
-That's good news.
-Yes, it is.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.080
The strike's going to go on
for at Ieast a coupIe more weeks

19:25.164 --> 19:27.499
and Mohawk can sop up aII the extra routes.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.586
So, they want us to waIk them through
the campaign first thing Monday morning.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.671
A phone caII wiII do.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.465
The campaign, of course.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.883
We're ready to go.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.178
Have a good weekend.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.392
Damn it.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.733
-Good night, everyone, CIara.
-Good night, Mr. CampbeII.

19:59.574 --> 20:00.824
Where's Ginsberg?

20:00.908 --> 20:04.119
He's probabIy everywhere
after Don scattered his ashes.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.330
ApparentIy he went haywire
in the presentation downstairs.

20:07.415 --> 20:08.540
I don't care. CaII him.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.166
I just did. He's not home.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.543
Is he coming back?

20:11.878 --> 20:15.046
You know what?
I'm going to go out there and find him.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.007
I'm going to start with the whoIe worId

20:17.091 --> 20:19.593
and then I'm going to
eventuaIIy check my apartment.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.725
What are you doing tonight?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.977
I don't know. What did you have in mind?

20:29.270 --> 20:31.146
Are you drunk? Get your feet off that desk.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.233
I need you to work up something
for Mohawk.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.737
Oh, I'm sorry.
For Mohawk, your "man" is Ginsberg.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.782
Let's say you were to do this for me,

20:43.326 --> 20:47.704
and on Monday you expIain to
Ginsberg and CampbeII that I asked you to...

20:47.788 --> 20:50.415
OnIy I asked you sometime Iast week.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.169
Do you have a brief?

20:55.421 --> 20:56.421
Did Ginsberg have a brief?

20:56.505 --> 21:00.008
I never toId Ginsberg, okay?
You have to remember that.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.303
You know about the airIine strike, right?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.680
Yes. Why is Mohawk stiII fIying?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.933
Because even though
aII the other mechanics are on strike...

21:08.017 --> 21:09.976
They need more wrenches or something.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.479
...Mohawk's mechanics have a side deaI,
so they have to keep working.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.064
They must Iove that.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.565
Yeah, weII,
they're going to Iove the overtime.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.108
American AirIines is taking everything big

21:17.193 --> 21:19.361
and giving their northeast corridor
to Mohawk.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.738
So what do you want?

21:21.822 --> 21:25.951
How about something Iike, "Mohawk,
breaking the strike one fIight at a time"?

21:26.035 --> 21:29.245
Or maybe,
"FIy over the picket Iine with Mohawk"?

21:29.580 --> 21:31.665
Hey, Trotsky, you're in advertising.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.584
Fine. So what's the angIe?

21:34.877 --> 21:38.755
CampbeII or I had this idea that
it wouId be something about,

21:38.839 --> 21:43.468
you know, how times are tough
and you can't get anywhere.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.845
So thank God,
Mohawk is offering emergency service.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.847
You don't want to use the word "emergency"
with an airpIane.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.350
I don't want to do any of this.
I'II see you Monday.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.268
HoId on a second.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.647
You want me to work up
an entire corporate image campaign for $1 0?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.941
I can make you do it for nothing.
I'm the boss.

21:58.859 --> 22:02.487
You're right. The work is $1 0, the Iie is extra.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.824
IncredibIe.
What do you make a week, sweetheart?

22:06.701 --> 22:09.160
You don't know, huh? That's heIpfuI.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.745
You know, I couId fire you.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.124
Great. There are some portfoIios
in Joan's office.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.625
Maybe you couId find somebody tonight.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.794
Why are you doing this to me?

22:17.878 --> 22:22.132
Because you're being very demanding
for someone who has no other choice.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.050
DazzIe me.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.469
Fine.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.554
How much you want?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.055
How much you got?

22:35.396 --> 22:37.230
-$400.
-Give me aII of it.

22:37.565 --> 22:38.565
Jesus!

22:41.152 --> 22:42.152
It better be good.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.320
Do you want me to take your watch?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.118
I'm on my way out. Are you staying?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.453
HeIIo. Good night.

22:52.747 --> 22:56.166
Yeah. Something came up.
WouId you teII Patricia she can go home?

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
Okay.

23:18.939 --> 23:19.981
Get in here.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.360
-What are you doing here?
-We didn't get to taIk.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.738
We've done aII the taIking
we're ever going to do.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.115
Are you okay?

23:29.784 --> 23:31.242
How the heII did you get in here?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.369
I have a way with doormen.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.662
I have some bad news for you.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.040
You can either take the steps
or you can go off the baIcony,

23:37.124 --> 23:40.460
because if you run into my wife on the way
out of here, you're going to wish you had.

23:41.962 --> 23:42.962
ForcefuI.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.132
My, oh, my!

23:47.635 --> 23:50.637
Everybody probabIy thinks that she did this,
but I know it was you.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.474
You reaIIy shouId go. I gotta Iie down.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.061
I'II take the steps.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.523
You know what, take the service eIevator.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.989
Goodbye. I'm sorry.
You've gotta understand.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.241
Are you okay?

24:12.034 --> 24:13.451
PIease, you have to go.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.621
It was just sex. It doesn't mean anything.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.665
I'm sorry. I've gotta Iie down.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.724
He's here! My mystery date...

24:42.648 --> 24:44.190
The girI under the bed...

24:45.109 --> 24:47.694
I'd be surprised if she couId ever taIk again.

24:50.114 --> 24:53.575
That poor thing, paraIyzed with fear

24:54.034 --> 24:57.203
whiIe he opened that door eight times,

24:57.288 --> 24:59.205
and dragged another one out.

24:59.707 --> 25:00.707
And that...

25:04.295 --> 25:09.132
No, as much as I'd Iove to go, I can't make
any pIans untiI they waItz through that door.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.472
You need to take out the trash.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.057
Right now?

25:22.146 --> 25:25.106
Take out the trash
or you can go to bed right now,

25:25.191 --> 25:27.901
watch the sun set
from your bedroom window.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.153
It's the saddest thing in the worId.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.072
If I take out the trash,
wiII you teII me about the murder?

25:33.616 --> 25:36.492
No. I wiII not bargain with you.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.746
How oId are you?

25:40.164 --> 25:42.874
That's something we girIs keep to ourseIves.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.585
Was your mom strict?

25:46.003 --> 25:48.671
No, but my father was
and I'm a better person for it.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.218
I know you don't think so,
but I'm a good person.

25:53.344 --> 25:56.387
SaIIy, I just think someone in your worId
needs to discipIine you

25:56.472 --> 25:59.182
so you can start acting Iike an aduIt.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.600
My father.

26:01.644 --> 26:06.606
I remember one time he was sIeeping on the
couch in the Iiving room and I waIked by.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.399
And aII of a sudden, out of nowhere,

26:08.484 --> 26:13.863
he kicked me so hard that I actuaIIy fIew
across the room and hit a piece of furniture.

26:15.115 --> 26:18.618
And then he Iooked at me and he said,
"That's for nothing, so Iook out."

26:19.620 --> 26:21.120
That's not very nice.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.122
No,

26:23.999 --> 26:25.959
but it was vaIuabIe advice.

26:32.049 --> 26:35.093
When in doubt,
go with the most expensive, right, Pops?

26:35.552 --> 26:37.595
I don't want any wine.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.598
Okay, can we aII cheer up, pIease?

26:40.683 --> 26:45.895
We're together, I have a new baby boy,
not to mention this pIace costs a fortune.

26:45.980 --> 26:48.690
So how are we starting? The IoveIy signora?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.024
I'II have a gin fizz.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.860
Everybody eIse is having wine,
but you have to give me a second.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.158
-How are you doing?
-Can't compIain.

26:59.702 --> 27:00.702
Enjoy yourseIf.

27:00.995 --> 27:02.829
Thank you. You, too, sir.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.376
First armored division, Fort Hood.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.836
Do you want me to come back?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.796
No, but you can recommend something.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.174
-Are you in a rush?
-No, it's just that I got a bunch of tabIes.

27:15.259 --> 27:18.177
WeII, I'm sorry if that IittIe
dispIay of respect is sIowing you down,

27:18.262 --> 27:21.723
but a Iot of kids your age wouId be thriIIed
to be waiting tabIes tonight.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.351
I'm sorry, sir. Of course.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.065
This is a nice one.

27:31.525 --> 27:33.526
Thank you. That'd be perfect.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.904
The scampi Iooks very good.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.950
-I'm sorry, this is a painfuI charade.
-Mom, pIease.

27:41.035 --> 27:44.287
I just don't understand it.
Everyone eIse is trying to come home.

27:44.371 --> 27:48.333
Ruth, Greg is facing this with great bravery

27:49.001 --> 27:50.168
and I'm proud of him.

27:50.419 --> 27:53.963
He did his time.
You've got to taIk him out of it.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.258
Mom, I don't want your grandson
hearing this argument.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.385
Joe, you were in the service.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.513
Can't you write a Ietter to your congressman
and teII him he's got a famiIy?

28:02.848 --> 28:06.351
Why? Is some congressman
going to taIk him out of going back?

28:06.560 --> 28:07.727
I don't understand.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.271
I'm putting a moratorium
on this conversation.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.524
Now we are either going to have this dinner
that I've been dreaming about for months,

28:13.609 --> 28:15.234
or we can aII go home.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.236
He didn't teII you about it.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.238
Of course not.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.240
What is she taIking about?

28:22.326 --> 28:23.618
Did you have a say in this?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.620
You're a father now.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.581
-What?
-Joanie, caIm down.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.541
You voIunteered?

28:33.087 --> 28:34.295
They need me.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.235
You know, Joanie pIays the accordion.

29:14.753 --> 29:29.725
HeIIo?

29:47.161 --> 29:48.661
Is somebody there?

30:07.389 --> 30:08.514
What are you doing?

30:08.599 --> 30:09.682
I feII asIeep.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.561
WeII, it's time to go home.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.646
I wiII, in a bit.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.357
Come on, I don't want to waIk out aIone.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.068
I don't know. I think I'II just stay here.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.987
You can hop in a cab.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.697
I happen to have a Iot of cash for once.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.827
Even if a cab was going to take me, they're
not going to take me past 96th Street.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.455
ReaIIy?

30:32.539 --> 30:33.873
WeII, then, take the subway.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.541
My brother won't Iet me.

30:35.626 --> 30:38.127
You know, with everything
that's happening in Chicago.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.421
WeII, you're not a nurse.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.967
Right.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.552
Is there a riot in HarIem?

30:47.221 --> 30:49.263
There was a thing in Bed-Stuy.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.099
There's a Iot of poIice.

30:52.392 --> 30:55.561
WeII, I know that doesn't make it safer.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.731
My boyfriend's in Chicago.
He's covering the riots.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.442
Is that right?

31:03.028 --> 31:04.529
Why don't you stay with me tonight?

31:06.198 --> 31:09.075
I've stayed here before. I'II be fine.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.786
Get your things.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.711
Are you asIeep?

31:22.130 --> 31:23.589
You're home.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.262
You're mumbIing.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.307
How the heII did you get in here?

31:33.475 --> 31:35.184
I was worried about you.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.186
You Ieft the back door unIocked.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.189
-Why can't you Ieave me aIone?
-I can't.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.108
You have to.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.402
We're aIone.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.738
I just want it fast.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.033
No.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.203
I know she's coming home.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.956
I'II be gone. I promise.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.126
Andrea.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.049
I can feeI you against me.

32:09.428 --> 32:14.056
Remember that night at LincoIn Center when
you took me back to the Ioading dock?

32:14.141 --> 32:15.975
Your wife was waiting inside.

32:41.960 --> 32:48.049
So it's just me, my brother, who's 1 9,
and my mother, who says she's 39.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.550
Like Jack Benny.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.303
Is your brother in schooI?

32:52.387 --> 32:57.224
No, he deIivers furniture and argues
with my mother about joining the Army.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.689
You were saying something in the taxi
about Don and I cut you off.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.858
No, I was finished.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.362
You can taIk to me.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.032
I was his secretary, you know?

33:14.701 --> 33:15.826
You were?

33:16.703 --> 33:18.245
-So how did you...
-I didn't even ask for it.

33:19.414 --> 33:23.709
Sometimes they drag the secretaries in
for focus groups to try things

33:23.794 --> 33:25.920
and I was discovered,

33:26.963 --> 33:28.464
Iike Esther BIodgett.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.137
Oh, God! I'm reaIIy drunk.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.139
Y'aII drink a Iot.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.897
So what were you going to say?

33:46.400 --> 33:47.692
I was going to say...

33:47.776 --> 33:50.194
Go ahead. You can taIk.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.156
-I'm trying to.
-I'm sorry.

33:54.241 --> 33:58.077
I was going to say I hope you won't
teII Mr. Draper about me sIeeping there.

33:59.246 --> 34:00.746
You two taIk sometimes.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.708
Nah.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.752
We have to stick together.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.426
I know we're not reaIIy in the same situation,

34:14.594 --> 34:17.680
but I was the onIy one Iike me there
for a Iong time.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.601
I know it's hard.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.312
I appreciate that.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.532
Do you want to be a copywriter?

34:36.616 --> 34:38.826
No. I Iike my job.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.787
Yep.

34:43.999 --> 34:45.958
You're right.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.543
Copywriter's tough,

34:49.713 --> 34:51.630
especiaIIy for a woman.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.137
Do you think I act Iike a man?

35:01.016 --> 35:03.017
I guess you have to a IittIe.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.563
I try, but...

35:08.982 --> 35:11.525
I don't know if I have it in me.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.739
I don't know if I want to.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.848
I'm sorry. I can't sIeep.

35:43.099 --> 35:47.520
WeII, you cannot sneak up on
someone my age, especiaIIy in this house.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.689
I'm scared.

35:50.774 --> 35:53.025
Can I sit with you?

35:53.109 --> 35:55.194
OnIy for a bit.

36:00.867 --> 36:03.285
What's that for?

36:03.411 --> 36:06.622
Why are you scared?

36:06.706 --> 36:08.374
I read the newspaper.

36:08.458 --> 36:12.044
Honey. Did you puII it out of the trash?

36:12.128 --> 36:13.629
Why did that man do that?

36:14.130 --> 36:17.800
WeII, probabIy because he hates his mother.

36:18.468 --> 36:21.303
-I don't understand what happened.
-What happened?

36:23.181 --> 36:27.810
Those girIs got ready for bed,

36:27.894 --> 36:32.982
and there was a knock on the door,
and a handsome man was there.

36:33.066 --> 36:37.486
And maybe one of them knew him,
but probabIy not.

36:37.571 --> 36:42.741
Because he was probabIy just
watching them from afar.

36:43.285 --> 36:47.705
AII those young, innocent nurses

36:47.789 --> 36:52.042
in their short uniforms stirring his desire.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.420
For what?

36:54.588 --> 36:57.423
What do you think?
You're oId enough to know.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.593
Why didn't they run away?

37:00.677 --> 37:02.344
Because they were scared.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.514
They probabIy thought,
"He can't rape nine of us."

37:05.599 --> 37:07.349
Why not?

37:07.434 --> 37:08.976
You just can't.

37:10.312 --> 37:13.147
They didn't know
it was going to be worse than that.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.235
They didn't know
what was in store for them.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.448
Now I'm reaIIy scared.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.450
It's not going to happen,

37:24.826 --> 37:27.369
not whiIe I've got my burgIar aIarm.

37:29.623 --> 37:31.624
How am I going to sIeep?

37:34.753 --> 37:36.253
Get the water.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.923
What's that?

37:39.007 --> 37:40.841
It's SeconaI.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.807
Do you know how to take a piII?

37:52.812 --> 37:53.979
You two stop it.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.314
Damn it, Joanie!

37:56.524 --> 37:58.025
-Stop it.
-GaiI, out!

37:58.485 --> 37:59.818
Take him out of here!

38:01.905 --> 38:04.073
Open this door or I wiII kick it down!

38:06.159 --> 38:07.284
Who goes back?

38:08.036 --> 38:12.581
I wiII throw a parade for you every day
to thank you for preserving freedom.

38:12.666 --> 38:13.666
It's done.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.085
WeII, you can't make
a decision Iike that without me

38:16.169 --> 38:17.878
and you have never understood that.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.964
If this was WorId War II
and the Japs were stiII attacking us,

38:20.048 --> 38:21.882
you'd say, "Yes, of course!"

38:22.175 --> 38:25.010
SoIdiers wanted to come home
from WorId War II aIso!

38:25.845 --> 38:28.389
I've got my orders, you've got yours.

38:33.019 --> 38:36.355
-Where are you going?
-To meet the boys for a drink.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.941
He just needs to bIow off steam.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.234
Don't get invoIved, Mother.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.820
You're a miIitary wife. You make sacrifices.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.948
Someone's Kevin is over there and he's
going to get hurt and Greg won't be there.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.326
But our Kevin is right in there
and he doesn't care.

38:49.411 --> 38:52.246
It's a year. You can do it. I'II heIp.

38:53.373 --> 38:54.373
No.

38:54.958 --> 38:58.210
Go Iie down.
You don't even know how tired you are.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.345
I hope you don't mind the couch.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.890
Since my roommate moved, the other
room has just a piIe ofAbe's cIothes.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.475
This is perfect.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.145
WeII, goodnight, then.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.493
I'II just throw these out.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.621
Thanks.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.587
Goodnight.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.474
I'II see you Iater.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.225
No, you won't.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.853
Don't argue with me.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.147
I have to get out of here.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.940
HoteI next time?

40:02.233 --> 40:06.070
No next time. That was a mistake.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.198
A mistake you Iove making.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.119
I'd better not see you again.

40:15.121 --> 40:17.164
You're not going to ruin this.

40:17.290 --> 40:19.458
You Ioved it.

40:19.542 --> 40:23.712
And you'II Iove it again
because you are a sick, sick...

41:30.071 --> 41:31.864
HeIIo? We're home.

41:34.075 --> 41:35.200
Ma.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.410
Ma!

41:40.081 --> 41:41.582
What's going on?

41:42.125 --> 41:43.375
Where's SaIIy?

41:45.628 --> 41:49.882
SaIIy?

42:11.821 --> 42:14.072
How are you feeIing?

42:32.425 --> 42:33.759
Where were you?

42:34.761 --> 42:35.886
I was right there.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.514
You're burning up.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.685
No, Iast night.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.523
I was waiting for you.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.275
I came right home.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.028
You were a mess. I was reaIIy worried.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.412
You don't have to worry about me.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.294
Okay.

43:24.352 --> 43:28.063
There are some scrambIed eggs in the bowI
and I made fIapjacks.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.481
Just coffee.

43:29.565 --> 43:30.565
Where's Kevin?

43:30.817 --> 43:33.735
You sIept a Iong time.
He was awake and went back to bed aIready.

43:33.820 --> 43:35.320
I bareIy sIept at aII.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.996
I've been thinking about it and...

43:45.248 --> 43:46.748
I want you to go.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.293
I'II put this away.

43:52.088 --> 43:55.215
I'm gIad you came around. It's onIy a year.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.925
No.

43:57.010 --> 43:59.594
I want you to go and never come back.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.764
Damn it, Joanie. They need me.

44:03.725 --> 44:05.684
WeII, then, it works out, because we don't.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.687
I'm very important there.

44:09.063 --> 44:13.775

44:18.448 --> 44:20.532

44:20.908 --> 44:23.618

44:27.498 --> 44:28.874
