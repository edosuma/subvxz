01:02.937 --> 01:07.402
We found a body. Her throat
was slit from ear to ear.

01:07.502 --> 01:09.645
Imagine she bled out
pretty quickly after that.

01:09.845 --> 01:11.678
But her killer didn't stop there. He...

01:12.748 --> 01:16.415
Well, the pictures speak for themselves.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.522
Not very pretty anymore. I know.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.496
What does any of this
have to do with me?

01:23.625 --> 01:25.659
Something. Nothing.

01:27.095 --> 01:29.741
That's what I'm here
trying to figure out.

01:33.902 --> 01:36.294
You recognize that man?

01:37.105 --> 01:38.407
No.

01:38.507 --> 01:42.611
- No? Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.969
Yes, you're sure, or yes,
you recognize the man in the photo?

01:46.782 --> 01:49.248
Am I in trouble?

01:49.484 --> 01:54.022
Maybe I should... have a lawyer?

01:54.756 --> 01:57.277
Right now, you and I,
we're just having a friendly conversation.

01:57.377 --> 02:02.030
No one else is here. You tell me
you want an attorney, that's your right.

02:02.130 --> 02:05.033
But see, you lawyer up, and...
that makes me start to think

02:05.133 --> 02:07.869
that you got something to hide.

02:07.969 --> 02:10.526
You got something to hide, Gemma?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.876
So I ask again:

02:14.976 --> 02:17.744
do you recognize this man?

02:23.718 --> 02:26.419
- It's Henry.
- Dr. Henry Moorehouse.

02:28.056 --> 02:30.459
Resident brain over at Baxter Pharm
for quite a few years

02:30.559 --> 02:33.562
before they had to let him go for...

02:33.662 --> 02:37.199
Well, it looks like
"unspecified mental health issues."

02:37.299 --> 02:39.167
I still don't understand
what any of this has to...

02:39.267 --> 02:41.937
Tell me about your involvement
with Moorehouse.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.668
You two were close.

02:45.407 --> 02:48.638
- That a question?
- See...

02:49.138 --> 02:51.546
along with Miss Sullivan,

02:51.646 --> 02:54.749
I've got a half a dozen bodies
laying in the morgue,

02:54.849 --> 02:59.821
all with similar CODs that all somehow
keep connecting back to Moorehouse.

02:59.921 --> 03:02.941
Only, when we finally track
the son of a bitch down,

03:03.041 --> 03:05.327
someone's already gone
and burned the place to the ground.

03:05.427 --> 03:08.730
The tech lab was able to salvage
a few hard drives found in the rubble.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.599
But the information on those drives

03:10.699 --> 03:14.064
poses more questions
than it does answers.

03:17.439 --> 03:19.141
That's where you come in.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.810
We already know you worked under him
for the last few months.

03:22.510 --> 03:25.612
I need to know what made
Henry Moorehouse murder those people.

03:26.715 --> 03:28.717
I'm thirsty.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.476
We can get you some water.

03:31.576 --> 03:34.654
Now... start from the beginning.

05:40.181 --> 05:42.818
<i>- You're ready?</i>
- Give me a sec.

05:43.118 --> 05:45.106
<i>Okay.</i>

05:48.857 --> 05:52.727
<i>Hello. I am Dr. Henry Moorehouse.</i>

05:52.827 --> 05:54.663
<i>During my tenure
at Baxter Pharmaceuticals,</i>

05:54.763 --> 05:58.133
<i>I was on the brink of developing
the basis for a genetic-level vaccine</i>

05:58.233 --> 06:02.804
<i>that could provide the human body
with a type of blanket immunity.</i>

06:02.904 --> 06:05.839
- <i>What I'm about to show you...</i>
- So this is what, a cure for cancer?

06:07.542 --> 06:11.679
- <i>May... maybe. Think bigger.</i>
- Bigger than cancer?

06:11.779 --> 06:14.716
This is a cure for everything.

06:14.816 --> 06:20.155
<i>Hepatitis, rabies, influenza,
HIV, even cancer.</i>

06:20.255 --> 06:24.459
<i>A universal cure that could save
millions of lives every year.</i>

06:24.959 --> 06:29.231
- How is that even possible?
- Baxter didn't believe me either.

06:29.731 --> 06:33.969
"A waste of time and money,"
I believe was their exact wording.

06:34.814 --> 06:36.471
Is that why you left?

06:36.671 --> 06:38.907
I didn't just leave.

06:39.007 --> 06:42.942
I took what was rightfully... mine.

06:44.212 --> 06:46.446
<i>Say hello to ELA.</i>

06:49.238 --> 06:52.299
<i>I designed her myself.</i>

06:54.489 --> 06:58.159
<i>ELA is a living incubator,
in vitro and in vivo.</i>

06:58.259 --> 07:02.197
<i>She's a breeding ground for a meta-virus
with a unique genetic signature</i>

07:02.297 --> 07:04.733
<i>that absorbs, replicates and re-codes</i>

07:04.833 --> 07:07.734
any viral load
introduced into her system.

07:09.070 --> 07:12.807
<i>And from the meta-virus
I can engineer a retrovirus.</i>

07:12.907 --> 07:15.777
- <i>And from that...</i>
- <i>A universal vaccine.</i>

07:15.877 --> 07:19.345
<i>Well, in theory anyway.</i>

07:22.584 --> 07:24.672
<i>Is it alive?</i>

07:27.288 --> 07:31.659
<i>ELA continues to mature
at an astonishing pace.</i>

07:31.759 --> 07:34.629
<i>At this rate, we'll be able to begin
phase-one serum trials</i>

07:34.729 --> 07:37.832
<i>a full six months ahead
of originally anticipated.</i>

07:37.932 --> 07:42.470
<i>She's proving to be every bit the miracle
I had hoped and planned for.</i>

07:42.570 --> 07:44.022
<i>Gemma...</i>

07:44.122 --> 07:47.809
<i>I fear she doesn't quite grasp
the importance of what we're doing here</i>

07:48.109 --> 07:51.677
<i>and what Baxter would do
if they ever found us out.</i>

07:53.048 --> 07:57.152
<i>Still, her presence has been...
a welcome addition.</i>

07:57.452 --> 08:01.593
<i>Remember, kids, don't try this at home.</i>

08:04.292 --> 08:07.445
Initiating phase one...

08:07.545 --> 08:09.443
now.

08:14.835 --> 08:17.125
Here we go. That's it.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.876
Phosphorene levels are stable.
Pulse ox normal.

08:24.679 --> 08:27.148
Perfect. That's my girl.

08:32.086 --> 08:34.121
Wait. Wait. Wait. No, that's...

08:34.222 --> 08:38.293
Oxygen levels are spiking. Shit.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.128
Shit. We're red-lining, Henry.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.996
- We're red-lining.
- No, no, no. She should be fine.

08:42.496 --> 08:44.920
The serum should be working.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.800
Hang on. Hang on.

08:51.605 --> 08:53.341
Give me 20 cc's of atropine.

08:53.441 --> 08:55.808
- Jesus.
- Where?

08:57.311 --> 08:59.546
It's not working.

09:00.849 --> 09:03.952
Henry, it's not working.

10:05.346 --> 10:09.917
The new cultures
have been stacked and packed.

10:10.017 --> 10:12.567
I'm gonna call it a night.

10:14.255 --> 10:16.313
Doc?

11:43.244 --> 11:46.080
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

11:46.180 --> 11:50.751
<i>I give you the cure for cancer.</i>

11:52.618 --> 11:55.120
<i>Fucking gross.</i>

11:56.257 --> 11:58.324
<i>Gemma!</i>

12:01.496 --> 12:03.371
<i>We're rolling.</i>

12:04.165 --> 12:05.567
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

12:05.767 --> 12:09.370
<i>Today is a very special day.</i>

12:09.470 --> 12:12.240
<i>If my calculations are correct...</i>

12:12.340 --> 12:15.610
<i>and they are...</i>

12:15.710 --> 12:20.214
<i>today is going to be the turning point
in man's evolutionary journey.</i>

12:24.118 --> 12:27.255
<i>So much for survival of the fittest.</i>

12:27.355 --> 12:29.791
<i>This is survival of the fittest</i>

12:29.891 --> 12:33.094
<i>but on a cellular level.</i>

12:33.694 --> 12:38.266
<i>The... meta-virus generated
within the host body</i>

12:38.366 --> 12:42.603
<i>is designed to attack weaker cell structures
and replace them with its own.</i>

12:42.703 --> 12:44.947
<i>These new cells are hard-coded
to be resistant </i>

12:45.047 --> 12:47.075
<i>to the introduction
of outside virus cells</i>

12:47.175 --> 12:50.478
<i>or even cancerous cells
generated within the body.</i>

12:50.578 --> 12:55.683
<i>So, here we go. First,
I'll be extracting 50 cc's of fluid</i>

12:55.783 --> 12:58.235
- <i>from one of the lymphatic nodes...</i>
- <i>Henry!</i>

12:59.337 --> 13:01.820
Don't... Don't touch me!

13:02.723 --> 13:04.592
- Henry, your hand.
- Don't touch me.

13:04.692 --> 13:06.127
- Your hand.
- Don't...

13:12.967 --> 13:15.803
Henry! Henry?

13:16.103 --> 13:19.841
Henry. Henry, can you hear me?

13:19.941 --> 13:22.848
Can you hear me, Henry? Henry.

13:28.816 --> 13:30.710
Ready?

13:45.733 --> 13:48.088
What the hell just happened?

13:51.339 --> 13:53.403
From...

13:53.874 --> 13:55.749
all appearances, a...

13:55.849 --> 13:58.713
spontaneous defense mechanism

13:58.813 --> 14:01.516
in response...

14:01.616 --> 14:03.882
to a...

14:05.052 --> 14:07.085
perceived threat.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.681
Save those.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.005
I thought you said it wasn't sentient.

14:24.105 --> 14:28.943
It's not. Not... Not in the way that...
that you and I would perceive it.

14:29.043 --> 14:31.153
What if you're wrong?

14:32.647 --> 14:34.782
How's... How's that?

14:35.082 --> 14:37.147
Well...

14:37.447 --> 14:41.428
what if this is a sign
from the universe that...

14:41.528 --> 14:44.158
we're not supposed to be
fucking around with this kind of thing?

14:44.258 --> 14:46.325
- Language.
- I'm serious.

14:48.330 --> 14:51.729
We're supposed to get sick...

14:52.266 --> 14:56.068
and grow old... and die.

14:59.307 --> 15:02.608
What happens when you take that
out of the equation?

15:05.179 --> 15:08.316
You're... You're underestimating
what I'm doing here.

15:08.416 --> 15:11.185
What I'm doing is much
more important than that.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.318
Is it?

15:14.922 --> 15:17.489
You give it time. You'll see.

15:21.662 --> 15:23.564
Recording?

15:27.969 --> 15:31.972
It's okay. She's dormant now.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.547
What's up? We cure cancer yet?

16:20.387 --> 16:21.754
Okay.

16:22.857 --> 16:23.925
Guess not.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.943
I just don't understand
why it's not taking.

16:26.043 --> 16:29.494
By all accounts, it should be working.

16:30.431 --> 16:32.867
All right. Well, I'm out.

16:32.967 --> 16:35.134
Get some sleep, okay?

17:44.305 --> 17:47.141
I wasn't gonna hurt you, you know.

17:50.211 --> 17:52.744
Yeah, yeah. I get it.

17:53.547 --> 17:55.510
Do not touch.

18:03.891 --> 18:05.293
Excuse me.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.999
Adding an amino acid string to the base

18:12.099 --> 18:16.737
may help prevent the meta-virus
from cannibalizing the host cells.

18:16.837 --> 18:20.791
The only question is how to prevent
the molecular burnout

18:20.891 --> 18:23.077
- that occurs...
- How about adding a protein receptor?

18:23.177 --> 18:25.546
It inhibits replication of the meta-virus,
rendering it unusable.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.983
- Yes, but if we were to...
- Will you please just...

18:29.083 --> 18:30.949
let me concentrate?

18:39.126 --> 18:41.019
Doc?

18:41.119 --> 18:43.628
You're gonna want to come see this!

18:47.968 --> 18:51.236
So, what are we looking at exactly?

18:52.940 --> 18:55.209
I'm not entirely sure.

18:55.794 --> 18:59.080
Although ELA's cell structure
was designed to mimic our own,

18:59.180 --> 19:04.082
she has and continues to accelerate
at an exponential rate.

19:32.646 --> 19:34.115
So?

19:34.215 --> 19:36.917
I would be remiss
in postulating any theories

19:37.017 --> 19:39.624
until I've had a chance
to run some proper tests.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.870
Yeah, that's it.

19:55.970 --> 19:58.573
With any luck I should...
know more in the morning.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.993
Perfect!

20:02.342 --> 20:04.213
Let's go.

20:06.180 --> 20:09.714
- Go where?
- Food time. I'm starving.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.519
Let's go.

20:24.231 --> 20:27.265
Cherry pie sounds pretty good about now.

20:28.502 --> 20:31.305
Cherry pie, a vanilla Coke

20:31.405 --> 20:34.175
- and a big cup of coffee.
- For dinner?

20:35.175 --> 20:37.743
What's the point of being grown up
if you can't have dessert for dinner?

20:41.815 --> 20:43.350
You okay?

20:45.219 --> 20:48.456
Yeah. I'm fine. I just...

20:49.156 --> 20:51.559
- I don't really get out much.
- Yeah, I've been there, done that.

20:52.059 --> 20:53.761
Got the T-shirt.

20:54.061 --> 20:56.530
During my... little stint in rehab,

20:56.630 --> 20:59.600
I pretty much shut myself
away from the world.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.383
Hey. You guys decide what you want?

21:01.483 --> 21:05.406
- Yeah.
- I will have the... the burger.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.327
How you want that?

21:08.976 --> 21:12.313
Rare. Still mooing, if you can.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.917
Got it. You?

21:15.017 --> 21:16.582
- Pie...
- She'll have the burger as well.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.297
Hey.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.055
Yeah, okay, I'll... I'll have a burger.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.460
How you want that?

21:26.560 --> 21:29.877
Burn it. Give me extra fries.

21:29.977 --> 21:31.782
You got it.

21:31.882 --> 21:34.502
- What the hell?
- You need a proper meal.

21:35.455 --> 21:37.102
Geez, thanks, Dad.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.141
- So...
- So yourself.

21:44.478 --> 21:45.569
Rehab?

21:49.616 --> 21:51.683
Yeah.

21:54.054 --> 21:58.690
High school was
a pretty tough time for me.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.192
I...

22:04.064 --> 22:09.096
It was just me and Dad, and Dad
wasn't exactly around all that much.

22:10.204 --> 22:14.372
I was a stupid kid
doing a lot of stupid shit, and...

22:15.482 --> 22:17.242
I got myself into a lot of trouble.

22:19.279 --> 22:21.248
Dad caught on during the worst of it

22:21.348 --> 22:25.486
and threw my ass into rehab
for a summer.

22:25.686 --> 22:29.189
I cleaned up my shit,
actually started going to school,

22:29.289 --> 22:33.725
and I've done pretty okay
for myself ever since then.

22:38.499 --> 22:40.134
So boom!

22:40.234 --> 22:44.838
This huge fireball explodes
right in his face.

22:44.938 --> 22:47.274
Burns off, like, half his beard.

22:47.374 --> 22:50.511
And by this point, we've nearly
burned down, like, the entire chem lab.

22:50.611 --> 22:53.781
And Natalie Patterson, she nearly
blows the whole thing for us

22:53.881 --> 22:56.383
because she can't stop laughing.

22:56.483 --> 22:59.887
- And you guys weren't caught?
- Hell no.

22:59.987 --> 23:03.654
You've never seen a pack
of freshmen girls run so fast.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.558
When's the last time you changed that?

23:13.233 --> 23:14.869
This is disgusting.

23:15.969 --> 23:18.236
- You begging for an infection or what?
- I've... I've been busy.

23:20.908 --> 23:23.410
Shit. Shit. What's the time?

23:23.910 --> 23:25.696
7:30.

23:25.796 --> 23:27.322
I gotta bail.

23:28.422 --> 23:32.217
- It's my dad's birthday.
- Yeah. Of course.

23:33.420 --> 23:36.056
- Are you okay for a ride home?
- I'll call a cab.

23:36.156 --> 23:38.258
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

23:39.593 --> 23:41.429
Okay.

23:41.929 --> 23:44.896
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Doc.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.219
Take care of that hand, okay?

23:50.771 --> 23:53.074
Get some rest!

23:56.710 --> 23:58.976
Good night, Gemma!

24:00.013 --> 24:02.647
Hey, where'd your girlfriend go?

24:02.747 --> 24:04.184
What?

24:04.284 --> 24:06.423
Your girlfriend.

24:06.523 --> 24:09.988
- No. She's not my girlfriend.
- Does she know that?

24:54.701 --> 24:56.543
Fuck!

25:49.637 --> 25:52.758
Come on. Come on. No, no, no, no.

26:04.338 --> 26:07.107
Doc? Henry!

26:07.207 --> 26:10.442
Where you at? Doc!

26:17.384 --> 26:20.451
Jesus! What the hell happened here?

26:24.091 --> 26:27.121
You look like dog shit on toast.

26:31.331 --> 26:33.767
Henry, you're burning up.

26:33.867 --> 26:38.105
- Come on. Let's get you to a hospital.
- I don't need a hospital.

26:38.205 --> 26:41.259
I need to finish the formula.

26:41.808 --> 26:45.610
It can wait. Come on.

26:51.017 --> 26:53.551
I had a son once.

26:57.691 --> 26:59.926
I...

27:00.026 --> 27:01.829
married a...

27:01.929 --> 27:05.363
truly awful girl.

27:06.099 --> 27:11.869
I was young and... dumb
when it came to that sort of thing.

27:14.808 --> 27:16.842
But Jacob...

27:20.447 --> 27:23.715
he was something else.

27:27.053 --> 27:29.613
There was this...

27:31.024 --> 27:34.659
light in his eyes. I...

27:36.296 --> 27:38.863
can't really explain it.

27:41.435 --> 27:43.745
It's called...

27:44.838 --> 27:49.407
lymphocytic choriomeningitis.

27:52.245 --> 27:54.757
Horrible thing.

27:58.685 --> 28:02.797
We did the best we could, but...

28:10.897 --> 28:14.298
She blamed me for his death...

28:15.936 --> 28:18.961
if you can imagine that.

28:22.142 --> 28:25.039
I guess I did too.

28:31.184 --> 28:35.986
She left me immediately after.

28:37.724 --> 28:39.760
And...

28:40.794 --> 28:43.797
And within a month,

28:43.897 --> 28:46.166
I was transferred

28:46.266 --> 28:50.718
to Baxter's Special

28:50.818 --> 28:52.871
Biologies Division.

28:53.573 --> 28:58.309
- ELA.
- She was just a hypothesis then.

28:59.145 --> 29:00.516
But...

29:00.947 --> 29:03.683
if there was...

29:03.783 --> 29:06.086
any way...

29:06.186 --> 29:09.223
to prevent what happened to Jacob,

29:10.291 --> 29:12.492
it was...

29:12.592 --> 29:15.159
up to me...

29:15.862 --> 29:17.890
to find it.

29:24.037 --> 29:26.071
My dad is dying.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.878
He was a scientist, like you, once.

29:31.278 --> 29:34.011
Well, not exactly like you.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.217
He worked...

29:37.317 --> 29:39.723
with nuclear fission mostly.

29:39.823 --> 29:42.489
He was a really,

29:42.589 --> 29:44.458
really smart guy.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.080
I think...

29:48.728 --> 29:51.262
I think it started...

29:52.599 --> 29:57.801
right around the time
I got home from... rehab.

29:58.271 --> 30:00.674
Little things at first.

30:00.774 --> 30:04.142
He'd be... absentminded.

30:05.312 --> 30:07.848
He started...

30:07.948 --> 30:12.289
talking to himself... more than normal.

30:15.388 --> 30:18.255
Then he started talking to...

30:18.925 --> 30:23.294
people who... weren't really there.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.201
And then the tremors came.

30:27.701 --> 30:31.630
Parkinson's... with dementia?

30:35.275 --> 30:37.821
Most of the time...

30:38.345 --> 30:41.478
he doesn't even know who I am.

30:47.487 --> 30:49.175
I'm losing him...

30:50.857 --> 30:53.570
piece by piece.

31:03.703 --> 31:06.737
Did Moorehouse have a drinking problem?

31:08.108 --> 31:10.179
No.

31:10.599 --> 31:12.667
Do you?

31:19.819 --> 31:22.522
What about after the accident?

31:22.622 --> 31:27.144
Did he exhibit any unusual
mood swings or angry outbursts?

31:27.244 --> 31:29.735
Anything out of the ordinary.

31:30.871 --> 31:34.267
Everything Henry did

31:34.367 --> 31:37.070
was out of the ordinary.

31:37.170 --> 31:40.105
But it got worse after that, didn't it?

31:41.841 --> 31:44.192
How bad did it get?

31:46.079 --> 31:47.914
Gemma!

31:48.014 --> 31:50.003
How bad did it get?

33:05.191 --> 33:07.324
<i>I was...</i>

33:07.891 --> 33:09.917
<i>incorrect...</i>

33:10.517 --> 33:15.735
<i>in my assumption of ELA's
new evolutionary step.</i>

33:17.370 --> 33:20.840
<i>Fluid retrieved from the... new growth</i>

33:20.940 --> 33:25.445
<i>was amniotic in nature.</i>

33:25.545 --> 33:28.247
<i>Damn quills,</i>

33:28.347 --> 33:34.354
<i>not a defense mechanism,
as I had hastily presumed,</i>

33:34.454 --> 33:39.756
<i>rather a type of genitalia,</i>

33:39.856 --> 33:44.564
<i>meant to deliver its offspring</i>

33:44.664 --> 33:50.236
<i>into a secondary host body.</i>

33:50.536 --> 33:51.549
<i>Me.</i>

35:05.478 --> 35:06.911
Baxter.

38:01.788 --> 38:03.001
<i>By all accounts,</i>

38:04.957 --> 38:09.460
<i>I should be dying of 13 different
incurable illnesses right now.</i>

38:10.997 --> 38:13.831
Intelligent design dictates that anything
less than the complete form

38:13.931 --> 38:16.485
wouldn't work at all.
It'd be so detrimental to the organ

38:16.585 --> 38:19.172
that it wouldn't survive the process
of natural selection.

38:20.072 --> 38:21.844
That makes you the anomaly.

38:25.011 --> 38:28.181
"Methinks we have hugely mistaken

38:28.681 --> 38:31.883
this matter of Life and Death.

38:33.069 --> 38:38.057
Methinks what they call
my shadow here on earth...

38:38.157 --> 38:40.993
is my true substance.

38:41.093 --> 38:45.263
In fact, take my body who will.

38:48.734 --> 38:51.088
It's not me."

40:19.392 --> 40:21.093
<i>Hello.</i>

40:21.193 --> 40:23.960
Hey, how come I'm locked out?

40:24.664 --> 40:26.232
<i>Gemma?</i>

40:26.332 --> 40:29.535
<i>What... What time is it?</i>

40:29.635 --> 40:31.601
I know. I know. I'm late. It's...

40:31.701 --> 40:34.173
It's after 10:00.
Traffic was a bitch this morning.

40:34.273 --> 40:36.976
<i>Late? No, you're...</i>

40:37.076 --> 40:39.178
<i>You're far too early.</i>

40:39.278 --> 40:41.113
What are you...

40:42.608 --> 40:45.585
<i>Come back later. Tonight.</i>

40:45.685 --> 40:48.167
Come on. Let me in, Doc.

41:19.051 --> 41:21.886
What the hell was the deal this morning?

41:35.334 --> 41:37.337
Do a little remodeling while I was gone?

41:38.037 --> 41:42.939
The lab was too bright.
It was too sterile.

41:44.410 --> 41:46.813
Which is the point, no?

41:47.213 --> 41:51.880
Science isn't meant to be constrained,
to be confined to a pristine environment.

41:51.980 --> 41:53.483
It's an organic thing, and it needs

41:53.583 --> 41:54.972
- to live and breathe.
- Okay.

41:55.072 --> 41:58.154
Don't they teach you anything
at that school?

41:58.991 --> 42:02.885
You know, I don't know what the hell
has gotten into you lately,

42:03.285 --> 42:05.368
but here.

42:06.132 --> 42:09.202
Picked you that up before I knew
you were gonna turn into Dr. Asshole.

42:09.302 --> 42:10.903
Gemma?

42:11.003 --> 42:13.554
Let go of me!

42:15.241 --> 42:17.255
I'm sorry.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.990
I'm an idiot.

42:23.549 --> 42:25.818
I'm sorry.

42:29.288 --> 42:33.065
Open your gift... jerk.

42:47.106 --> 42:49.183
Now...

42:52.278 --> 42:54.911
you're the perfect...

42:55.248 --> 42:57.745
mad scientist.

43:03.288 --> 43:07.426
- I don't know what to say.
- "Thanks" would be a good start.

43:07.526 --> 43:09.562
Thank you.

43:09.662 --> 43:11.895
Thank you. Thank you.

44:43.422 --> 44:44.457
What's the deal?

44:44.857 --> 44:48.294
Baxter. They're spying on me.
Surely you saw them out there.

44:48.994 --> 44:50.329
Are you okay?

44:50.429 --> 44:52.858
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm better than fine.

44:52.958 --> 44:56.550
You don't look fine.
Will you just sit down?

44:57.803 --> 45:00.537
- How's your hand?
- Fuck my hand!

45:02.975 --> 45:05.041
Never mind.

45:09.882 --> 45:11.741
Where is it?

45:11.841 --> 45:13.152
Where is what?

45:13.252 --> 45:16.856
The rest of the damn blood.

45:17.456 --> 45:22.495
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- There's barely 10 pints in here.

45:22.595 --> 45:28.034
And I specifically requested 40 pints.

45:28.134 --> 45:29.996
They must have made a mistake
at the warehouse.

45:30.096 --> 45:33.806
- I'll go back tomorrow and...
- And?

45:33.906 --> 45:36.613
Are you trying to kill me?

45:37.343 --> 45:39.445
I am trying to...

45:39.545 --> 45:43.115
- You irresponsible child!
- ...to help you, to attempt to...

45:43.415 --> 45:47.718
You know what? You're fucking useless.

45:55.361 --> 45:58.598
- Where are you going?
- Fuck you, Doc.

45:58.798 --> 46:01.799
I don't do bat-shit crazy.

46:01.899 --> 46:03.336
Wait. Gemma?

46:03.536 --> 46:06.072
- Gemma?
- Let go of me!

46:06.172 --> 46:10.540
- Gemma!
- Get the fuck out of my way!

47:39.932 --> 47:41.801
The anomalous becomes the singular,
becomes the natural.

47:41.901 --> 47:44.270
The nature of the natural is burned down
in the fire of creation/re-creation.

47:44.370 --> 47:45.453
The snake choking on its tail!

47:45.553 --> 47:48.474
Only in belief of a God does man
temper his beliefs like a lowly worm.

47:48.874 --> 47:52.294
Worm must rise... up.

48:42.427 --> 48:43.443
What?

48:45.330 --> 48:47.797
<i>I need to see you.</i>

48:50.536 --> 48:53.139
It's 4:00 in the morning.

48:53.739 --> 48:56.002
<i>Please...</i>

48:56.693 --> 49:00.517
<i>just come over. I'll explain everything.</i>

49:04.683 --> 49:06.497
I can't keep doing this, Henry.

49:08.287 --> 49:10.353
<i>Please.</i>

49:11.523 --> 49:12.757
<i>It's important.</i>

49:14.827 --> 49:17.752
<i>I wouldn't ask otherwise.</i>

49:18.430 --> 49:21.579
Fuck. Fine. You win.

49:21.679 --> 49:23.908
<i>Thank you.</i>

49:30.309 --> 49:32.321
Hello?

49:38.083 --> 49:40.121
Henry?

49:42.120 --> 49:43.355
Hello, Gemma.

49:43.655 --> 49:46.657
Jesus! You scared the shit out of me!

49:47.893 --> 49:50.582
You wanna tell me what's going on?

49:52.498 --> 49:54.633
Jesus! What the fuck, Henry?

49:54.733 --> 50:00.441
I'm sorry. That was wholly
inappropriate and stupid of me.

50:00.541 --> 50:02.408
What's going on with you lately, anyway?

50:02.508 --> 50:07.179
I mean, one minute you're acting
like I'm this horrible, clueless beast,

50:07.279 --> 50:11.080
and then the next... you know.

50:11.417 --> 50:14.878
It's been a crazy...

50:15.254 --> 50:16.971
few days.

50:17.071 --> 50:19.255
Apparently.

50:23.795 --> 50:27.606
Did you bring me all the way out here
just so you could kiss me?

50:29.301 --> 50:31.327
No.

50:35.040 --> 50:37.589
I have a favor to ask.

50:45.484 --> 50:47.308
Take off your pants.

50:47.408 --> 50:49.221
Pardon?

50:49.321 --> 50:51.123
Those.

50:51.223 --> 50:53.264
Off.

50:59.498 --> 51:04.500
I cannot believe
that I let you talk me into this.

51:19.918 --> 51:21.963
Satisfied?

51:26.591 --> 51:28.584
Sit.

51:56.255 --> 51:59.589
Vein in my arm not good enough for you?

53:18.504 --> 53:20.491
Henry!

53:23.875 --> 53:26.419
No! Henry!

53:49.401 --> 53:51.870
Do you need a minute?

53:51.970 --> 53:54.212
Why, Detective?

53:54.873 --> 53:56.798
Are you here to comfort me?

53:58.250 --> 54:00.449
Do you recognize this man?

54:06.985 --> 54:09.218
Should I?

54:10.389 --> 54:12.357
His name was Harrison Palmer.

54:13.257 --> 54:17.396
Spent most of his time...
chasing down cheating husbands

54:17.496 --> 54:19.556
and insurance fraudsters.

54:19.656 --> 54:24.667
Until Baxter Pharm put him on payroll...
to check in on Moorehouse.

54:26.338 --> 54:28.225
So they were spying on him.

54:28.325 --> 54:32.411
Baxter says Harry stopped
reporting in with them several weeks ago.

54:32.511 --> 54:34.479
His girlfriend reported him missing

54:34.579 --> 54:37.813
after he left for work one evening
and never came home.

54:37.913 --> 54:39.615
You know anything about that?

54:46.792 --> 54:48.727
Excuse me, ma'am.

54:48.827 --> 54:50.518
Fuck you!

55:00.906 --> 55:03.241
Dr. Moorehouse?

55:06.979 --> 55:09.045
Henry?

55:18.890 --> 55:21.724
Beautiful, isn't she?

55:22.761 --> 55:24.794
Moorehouse.

55:59.631 --> 56:02.270
You were right.

56:06.037 --> 56:08.905
I do feel much better.

56:10.542 --> 56:13.625
I should have listened to you sooner.

56:38.103 --> 56:40.305
They're in my blood.

56:40.405 --> 56:43.208
Blood is the key.

56:43.308 --> 56:45.210
They're in my blood.

56:45.310 --> 56:48.570
Blood is the key.

57:30.288 --> 57:32.856
<i>They say she's a curse</i>

57:33.692 --> 57:37.122
<i>A kiss of death</i>

57:37.222 --> 57:40.332
<i>The fall of man</i>

57:40.532 --> 57:43.902
<i>And all the rest</i>

57:44.002 --> 57:47.576
<i>Don't get too close</i>

57:51.242 --> 57:54.292
<i>You could be next</i>

57:58.016 --> 58:01.875
<i>I chose to ignore</i>

58:01.975 --> 58:05.023
<i>This advice</i>

58:05.123 --> 58:07.190
<i>The way she looked...</i>

59:04.148 --> 59:06.276
What?

59:07.752 --> 59:09.855
Yes, I know.

59:10.055 --> 59:11.923
Yeah, I know!

59:12.023 --> 59:14.927
I should be careful next time.

59:15.027 --> 59:17.396
Of course.

59:17.496 --> 59:19.998
No, I don't know!

59:20.098 --> 59:24.868
Would you just give me
a chance to think!

59:30.542 --> 59:33.412
Would you quit acting
like you know everything!

59:33.812 --> 59:36.448
I'm the smart one here!

59:36.548 --> 59:38.881
You'll see.

59:41.252 --> 59:42.262
You'll see.

59:47.559 --> 59:49.961
Hello, Henry.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.589
Why are you here?

01:00:00.572 --> 01:00:03.543
I didn't know where else to go.

01:00:04.242 --> 01:00:06.507
He's gone.

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:10.315
You shouldn't have come back.

01:00:10.415 --> 01:00:12.584
Did you hear me, you asshole?

01:00:12.884 --> 01:00:16.821
There's nothing left for me there!
Do you hear me? There's...

01:00:25.095 --> 01:00:28.129
I'm not afraid of you.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.832
You should be.

01:00:51.055 --> 01:00:54.026
You're sick, Henry.

01:00:55.526 --> 01:00:56.991
We need to get you help.

01:00:58.763 --> 01:01:02.701
Sick? On the contrary.

01:01:03.301 --> 01:01:06.353
I've never felt better.

01:01:07.005 --> 01:01:11.073
Everything that I've been
working towards?

01:01:12.537 --> 01:01:14.616
This is it.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.208
And now...

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:20.716
I understand everything.

01:01:21.019 --> 01:01:23.090
I've been cured.

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:24.860
Cured of what?

01:01:26.658 --> 01:01:29.486
My mortality.

01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:36.138
I can cure you too. Let me show you.

01:01:36.438 --> 01:01:38.804
No. No! You don't have to do this!

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:43.775
Man is nothing but an ape
pretending to be God.

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:45.877
And now we can be gods.

01:01:45.977 --> 01:01:50.156
You're wrong. This isn't you.
This isn't the man I fell in love with.

01:01:53.184 --> 01:01:55.150
I love you.

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:01.839
I fucking love you.

01:02:09.234 --> 01:02:12.067
I love you, Henry.

01:02:12.237 --> 01:02:14.269
They're...

01:02:15.206 --> 01:02:17.668
inside of me.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.420
Eating me alive.

01:02:30.588 --> 01:02:32.352
Help me.

01:02:39.163 --> 01:02:41.130
Gemma?

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.070
All I want to hear
out of you right now...

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:49.107
is what the living fuck is going on.

01:02:49.207 --> 01:02:51.441
- Let me out.
- Henry.

01:02:53.178 --> 01:02:56.147
Have you ever heard...

01:02:56.247 --> 01:02:59.484
of a Glyptapanteles?

01:02:59.584 --> 01:03:01.386
What the fuck does this
have to do with anything...

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.822
A horrifyingly...

01:03:03.922 --> 01:03:08.357
disingenuous wasp...

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.297
that lays its eggs...

01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:16.799
into an unsuspecting caterpillar.

01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:22.671
And with the help of a poly-DNA virus,

01:03:23.274 --> 01:03:27.943
it can not only disable...

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:31.583
the caterpillar's immune system,

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:34.919
but it can control its motor skills

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:38.013
while its larvae feed on it.

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:42.126
She's...

01:03:42.226 --> 01:03:43.943
the wasp.

01:03:45.396 --> 01:03:49.031
- And you're?
- The caterpillar.

01:03:49.334 --> 01:03:53.505
In order for a virus

01:03:53.605 --> 01:03:57.475
to survive and sustain,

01:03:57.575 --> 01:04:00.812
it must continually infect.

01:04:00.912 --> 01:04:04.916
By ingesting large quantities
of fresh blood,

01:04:05.016 --> 01:04:07.819
the parasites do their job

01:04:07.919 --> 01:04:11.189
without devouring me completely.

01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:12.841
The transfusion.

01:04:12.941 --> 01:04:16.453
That's why you wanted my blood?

01:04:18.629 --> 01:04:21.166
You drank my fucking blood?

01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:25.603
You have no idea

01:04:25.703 --> 01:04:27.105
what it's like.

01:04:28.606 --> 01:04:30.742
The hunger.

01:04:30.842 --> 01:04:35.377
The need to constantly feed.

01:04:36.547 --> 01:04:39.481
I wasn't the only one, was I?

01:04:41.652 --> 01:04:42.808
How many?

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.131
How many others were there?

01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:07.109
It's complicated.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.082
What happened?

01:05:11.182 --> 01:05:14.727
What happened to them?
What the fuck did you do?

01:05:23.227 --> 01:05:26.781
You don't understand, do you?

01:05:32.537 --> 01:05:34.372
My body

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:36.975
doesn't belong to me

01:05:37.075 --> 01:05:39.471
anymore.

01:05:40.711 --> 01:05:44.213
I'm a prisoner inside myself.

01:05:53.557 --> 01:05:55.684
Gemma.

01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.459
Let me out.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:05.330
Gemma.

01:06:08.806 --> 01:06:11.168
Gemma.

01:06:11.742 --> 01:06:15.847
Let... me... out.

01:06:15.947 --> 01:06:17.715
Gemma!

01:06:17.815 --> 01:06:21.917
Let... me... out!

01:06:38.169 --> 01:06:39.397
Gemma?

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:43.705
It's okay.

01:06:44.075 --> 01:06:45.610
What are you doing?

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:50.503
Everything is going to be okay.
I understand everything now.

01:07:13.304 --> 01:07:15.337
Good morning.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:20.886
I'm thirsty.

01:07:23.481 --> 01:07:24.949
What are you doing?

01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:28.052
I'm finding a way to save you.

01:07:28.152 --> 01:07:30.704
There's nothing you can do.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.141
This... What is it?

01:07:36.241 --> 01:07:38.126
Nothing.

01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:40.590
It doesn't exist.

01:07:41.466 --> 01:07:43.563
You're wasting your time.

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:47.705
Whatever is happening to you,
there has gotta be a way to reverse it.

01:07:47.805 --> 01:07:52.710
What good is one little girl

01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:56.512
against the legacy of evolution?

01:07:57.882 --> 01:08:00.952
There's no place in science

01:08:01.052 --> 01:08:04.392
for a junkie like you.

01:08:05.256 --> 01:08:10.316
Your daddy was right to abandon you.

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:30.305
I'm gonna kill you, you fucking Judas.

01:08:31.115 --> 01:08:32.750
You hear me, bitch?

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.687
I am going

01:08:35.787 --> 01:08:37.689
to destroy you.

01:08:39.002 --> 01:08:40.843
Fucking bitch.

01:08:43.426 --> 01:08:45.836
Die.

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:15.787
Gemma?

01:09:21.332 --> 01:09:23.541
What is that?

01:09:24.734 --> 01:09:26.615
It's your formula, Henry.

01:09:28.906 --> 01:09:31.189
Impossible.

01:09:35.078 --> 01:09:37.749
You couldn't have completed my work.

01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:39.884
Why?

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:43.952
'Cause I'm just some
stupid fucking girl?

01:09:47.691 --> 01:09:50.778
You know, you never...

01:09:51.129 --> 01:09:56.331
actually gave me a chance
to show you what I was capable of.

01:10:00.604 --> 01:10:02.847
But you're right.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:08.803
I didn't finish your formula. You did.

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:14.051
This whole time...

01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:17.354
you were looking for the "X" factor...

01:10:17.454 --> 01:10:20.758
when it was right there in front of you.

01:10:20.858 --> 01:10:24.215
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:10:24.315 --> 01:10:26.145
Your infected blood, Doc.

01:10:38.909 --> 01:10:40.507
You're lying!

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:45.683
You... are lying.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:48.049
Am I?

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:57.926
When I am free,

01:10:59.029 --> 01:11:02.266
I'm going to rip you

01:11:02.366 --> 01:11:06.137
from cunt to throat.

01:11:06.237 --> 01:11:10.274
And then I'm going to drain

01:11:10.374 --> 01:11:14.577
every last drop of you.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.273
This is gonna hurt.

01:11:18.282 --> 01:11:20.151
A lot.

01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:22.066
No...

01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:42.507
Henry?

01:11:42.607 --> 01:11:46.998
Henry, wake... wake up.
Wake up! Wake up!

01:12:19.276 --> 01:12:22.781
- Fuck.
- Language.

01:14:02.913 --> 01:14:05.409
What happens next?

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:21.575
Are you sure about this?

01:14:23.901 --> 01:14:26.468
When you find...

01:14:26.804 --> 01:14:30.163
something in this world that's...

01:14:31.108 --> 01:14:32.797
so unique,

01:14:32.897 --> 01:14:35.347
incredible...

01:14:35.946 --> 01:14:38.453
and beautiful,

01:14:40.551 --> 01:14:44.118
the first thought is to cut it open...

01:14:45.255 --> 01:14:49.692
and see how it works.
But the next thing you know...

01:14:51.161 --> 01:14:53.965
it's just a bloody mess,

01:14:54.065 --> 01:14:57.468
and you don't know why you had
to tamper with it in the first place.

01:14:57.668 --> 01:14:59.735
The beauty is gone.

01:15:01.138 --> 01:15:03.029
Never get it back.

01:15:08.145 --> 01:15:12.163
The cure is too dangerous for us
to risk it getting out into the world.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:15.786
If anyone were to find out what we had,

01:15:16.086 --> 01:15:18.844
it'd be the end of mankind as a species.

01:15:19.957 --> 01:15:22.190
And us?

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.727
We go on living.

01:15:30.601 --> 01:15:32.665
Cheers.

01:15:48.352 --> 01:15:49.699
I love you.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:55.957
I... I...

01:16:05.068 --> 01:16:07.287
I'm sorry.

01:17:39.796 --> 01:17:41.065
<i>Gemma.</i>

01:17:41.265 --> 01:17:43.823
<i>In time...</i>

01:17:45.269 --> 01:17:48.965
<i>I hope... you will come to understand...</i>

01:17:49.933 --> 01:17:52.963
<i>why it had to be this way.</i>

01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.222
<i>Despite our...</i>

01:17:59.322 --> 01:18:05.122
<i>best efforts, I fear I remain... cured.</i>

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:10.344
<i>Although the parasites
have been destroyed,</i>

01:18:10.444 --> 01:18:13.464
<i>my physiology has been...</i>

01:18:13.964 --> 01:18:17.551
<i>irrevocably altered.</i>

01:18:17.868 --> 01:18:20.402
<i>The hunger,</i>

01:18:21.438 --> 01:18:22.622
<i>the...</i>

01:18:23.322 --> 01:18:28.546
<i>primal need for blood remains unchanged.</i>

01:18:29.046 --> 01:18:30.447
<i>For your safety...</i>

01:18:30.547 --> 01:18:36.053
<i>dare I say, the safety of all mankind...</i>

01:18:36.153 --> 01:18:40.024
<i>I cannot be permitted to remain</i>

01:18:40.124 --> 01:18:43.658
<i>a wolf among the sheep.</i>

01:19:27.204 --> 01:19:30.261
That's quite the story you've got there.

01:19:31.008 --> 01:19:33.621
I told you you wouldn't understand.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:37.665
What I understand...

01:19:38.749 --> 01:19:42.593
is that Henry Moorehouse...
is a sick fucking monster!

01:19:42.693 --> 01:19:45.086
We're all monsters.

01:19:46.056 --> 01:19:48.179
Henry?

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.889
He transcended that.

01:19:52.863 --> 01:19:55.452
He really was on to something.

01:19:56.132 --> 01:19:58.335
So Moorehouse...

01:19:58.435 --> 01:20:02.673
destroyed all his work
and killed himself,

01:20:02.773 --> 01:20:08.683
leaving you as a convenient
sole survivor to tell his story?

01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:14.161
He didn't destroy everything.

01:20:15.819 --> 01:20:19.754
Henry's blood is inside of me.

01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:23.385
I've been cured.

01:22:50.707 --> 01:22:53.751
Honey, come here.

01:22:58.548 --> 01:23:01.952
Come on, baby. Finish your dinner.
We gotta hit the road.

01:23:02.052 --> 01:23:04.166
Okay, Mommy.
