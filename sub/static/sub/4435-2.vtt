Hey, guys!

00:39.875 --> 00:41.999
Morning!

00:42.208 --> 00:44.124
How's it going, everybody?

00:44.333 --> 00:46.749
'Sup, Jason?

00:46.958 --> 00:48.499
Hey, dudes, what's up?

00:48.708 --> 00:50.874
What are you guys doing here?

00:51.083 --> 00:53.832
What do you mean?
We're just going to school.

00:54.833 --> 00:57.040
I thought you guys said
you didn't need school.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.374
Yeah, you said you had
a start-up company

00:58.583 --> 01:00.332
and that school was
for douche bags.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.415
Oh, well, yeah,

01:03.625 --> 01:05.790
the start-up company thing
didn't really work out.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.832
But you told us all
to go fuck ourselves.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.165
Oh, no, no, you guys.
Guys.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.499
W-What we said was --

01:12.708 --> 01:14.832
You told us your company
was gonna make $10 million

01:15.041 --> 01:17.082
and the rest of us
could go fuck ourselves.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.499
We were trying to be funny.

01:19.708 --> 01:22.665
Yeah, well,
no one's laughing, Kyle.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.457
Hey, Wendy.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.832
You're back?

01:35.041 --> 01:36.874
Yeah, the start-up-company
thing didn't work out.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.165
Oh, wow.
I'm shocked.

01:40.291 --> 01:41.832
So, hey, I was gonna see
if you still wanted

01:42.041 --> 01:43.290
to see that stupid
"Maze Runner" movie.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.874
You broke up with me, Stan.

01:45.083 --> 01:48.249
You said you had to be free
to chase your dreams.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.165
Wendy, I thought
my life was going

01:50.375 --> 01:52.040
in a different direction
and I just felt

01:52.250 --> 01:53.832
that I really had to give it
everything I had.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.707
You know, I had to focus
on one thing.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.915
Is that why you told Clyde
that you broke up with me

01:58.125 --> 02:01.707
because you're about to be
"dripping in bitches"?

02:01.916 --> 02:02.832
Why does everyone
suddenly remember

02:03.041 --> 02:04.332
everything everybody says?

02:04.541 --> 02:05.832
I'm happy, Stan.

02:06.041 --> 02:07.832
I'm happy I know
who you really are now.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.540
You're someone who can't
be counted on.

02:09.750 --> 02:12.624
You're someone who can just bail
on the people you love.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.457
Dude, people are
pissed off at us.

02:20.666 --> 02:22.040
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

02:22.250 --> 02:23.624
Doesn't anyone understand
the significance

02:23.833 --> 02:25.415
of "I'm sorry" anymore?

02:25.625 --> 02:27.207
Yeah, well said, Kyle.
Good point.

02:27.416 --> 02:29.124
What -- What happened
to the significance?

02:29.333 --> 02:32.124
Well, I guess let's just be
thankful we're not Butters.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.415
They won't even let him
come back to school.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.165
All right, everyone,
thanks for coming.

02:36.375 --> 02:38.082
As you know,
we urgently need to discuss

02:38.291 --> 02:39.665
the matter of Butters Stotch,

02:39.875 --> 02:41.624
who set fire
to the school gymnasium

02:41.833 --> 02:42.999
and is now asking to come back.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.665
- Are we all set to start?
- Almost.

02:44.875 --> 02:47.124
We're just waiting
on Mr. Mackey. Again.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.790
Aw, do we need Mackey here?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.249
Yeah, all he's gonna
talk about is how

02:50.458 --> 02:53.665
he's gluten-free now
and he feels so fucking amazing.

02:53.875 --> 02:55.499
Well, you have to admit
he does look a little better.

02:55.708 --> 02:56.999
He doesn't look
any different to me.

02:57.208 --> 02:58.540
In the cheeks, you don't think
he looks a little fuller?

02:58.750 --> 03:00.165
It's just the new diet fad.

03:00.375 --> 03:01.624
MR. - Sorry I'm late.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.332
I had to stop
and get my own breakfast

03:03.541 --> 03:05.040
because I figured
y'all would be having doughnuts,

03:05.250 --> 03:07.832
but I'm actually gluten-free, so
I can't have doughnuts, m'kay.

03:08.041 --> 03:09.665
Yes, Mr. Mackey,
we're all aware

03:09.875 --> 03:10.999
that you're gluten-free now.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.332
I'm just saying
that I personally feel

03:13.541 --> 03:15.457
so fucking amazing.

03:15.666 --> 03:18.957
Can we discuss the gymnasium
and get out of here, please?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.999
Right, so the issue,
as you all know,

03:21.208 --> 03:23.790
is that Butters set fire
to the gymnasium last week

03:24.000 --> 03:26.165
and ran away laughing
and flipping everyone off.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.957
That's probably gluten, m'kay.

03:28.166 --> 03:28.999
Oh, God.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.665
Gluten causes sluggishness,
irritability,

03:31.875 --> 03:33.665
and nearly all
behavioral problems.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.707
I seriously cannot take
hearing about gluten anymore.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.332
See, that's probably
the gluten talking, m'kay.

03:39.541 --> 03:41.999
If you cut out gluten,
you don't ever get pissed off.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.499
Really?

03:43.708 --> 03:45.790
I might just have to give
this gluten-free thing a try.

03:46.000 --> 03:46.999
How does it work?

03:47.208 --> 03:50.415
Oh, no, don't try --
Oh, God, here we go.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.124
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.874
It's been like four hours and
people still won't talk to us.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.832
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

04:06.041 --> 04:07.207
You know what we got to do,
guys?

04:07.416 --> 04:08.999
We got to throw
a big fucking party.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.540
- Mrph rmhmhm?
- Yeah.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.832
How do you make everyone
like you?

04:12.041 --> 04:13.207
You have a big party
and invite everyone,

04:13.416 --> 04:14.624
and then everyone thinks
you're cool.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.915
Dude, that would have to be,
like, the best party ever.

04:17.125 --> 04:17.749
Well, I'm down.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.082
Between the four of us, we can
throw the sweetest party ever,

04:20.291 --> 04:22.165
and these assholes won't even
remember us being dicks to them.

04:22.375 --> 04:25.624
Hey, that might work.
But it can't be a party for us.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.040
Right, it's got to be
an awesome party for...

04:28.250 --> 04:30.040
For someone that we love
who needs us

04:30.250 --> 04:31.665
and that we refuse
to bail on.

04:31.875 --> 04:32.999
- What?
- No, no, he's right.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.499
We got to make it
for someone in need

04:34.708 --> 04:35.874
so that people have to go.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.082
We lure people in
with a cause

04:37.291 --> 04:38.874
and then hit 'em over the head
with the best party ever.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.832
We're gonna have pizza and cake
and a sweet band.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.290
A band!
Holy shit, Stan!

04:42.500 --> 04:44.207
Didn't you say your dad knows
somebody who knows Lorde?

04:44.416 --> 04:46.665
Yeah, he said some guy at work
is Lorde's uncle or something.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.874
Oh, my God,
we've got Lorde to play live.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.374
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

04:50.583 --> 04:51.749
So who do we throw
the party for?

04:51.958 --> 04:52.832
What do you mean?

04:53.041 --> 04:54.374
We have a friend
who needs us right now,

04:54.583 --> 04:55.624
and we can't let him down.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.040
♪ Better get
this party started ♪

04:58.250 --> 05:01.582
♪ Get this party started,
ohh ♪

05:01.791 --> 05:04.374
All right, that was
"Get the Party Started,"

05:04.583 --> 05:07.207
and joining me in the studio now
are four local boys

05:07.416 --> 05:10.874
who are gearing up to throw
the most epic party ever.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.415
Is that right, boys?

05:12.625 --> 05:14.249
Yeah, it's going to be
this weekend.

05:14.458 --> 05:15.957
You know, we just wanted
to give back to the community

05:16.166 --> 05:17.082
and show everyone a good time.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.082
Now, this party's also
for a good cause

05:19.291 --> 05:21.749
because it's to honor
a little boy with diabetes.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.790
Scott Malkinson.
Is that correct?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.624
Yeah, you know,
diabetes affects us all,

05:25.833 --> 05:27.249
but it mostly affects
Scott Malkinson.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.665
Yeah, and we just, you know,
we can't turn our back on him.

05:29.875 --> 05:30.790
Must be pretty special

05:31.000 --> 05:32.624
having a big party
in your honor, Scott.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.707
How does it feel?

05:33.916 --> 05:36.665
I actually have plans
this weekend.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.207
"I actually
have plans this weekend.

05:38.416 --> 05:40.165
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I've got diabetes."

05:40.375 --> 05:42.207
All right, well, we got
lots of people calling in.

05:42.416 --> 05:43.999
Caller, what's your question?

05:44.208 --> 05:45.665
Are you guys making this up?

05:45.875 --> 05:47.832
Nope, we're gonna have
all the pizza you can eat,

05:48.041 --> 05:51.749
20 different cakes,
and Lorde is going to play live.

05:51.958 --> 05:53.290
All the pizza we can eat?

05:53.500 --> 05:54.457
Believe it, dude.

05:54.666 --> 05:56.374
All right.
This better be good.

05:56.583 --> 05:57.915
All right,
it's sure to be a blast.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.290
Phone lines are going crazy!

05:59.500 --> 06:00.249
Sweet!

06:00.458 --> 06:01.957
Next caller,
what's your question?

06:02.166 --> 06:03.790
Yes, will
there be gluten-free options

06:04.000 --> 06:05.290
for people at this party?

06:05.500 --> 06:06.290
Excuse me?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.999
Well, I've been gluten-free

06:08.208 --> 06:09.165
for about a day now,

06:09.375 --> 06:11.707
and I have to say,
I feel so amazing.

06:11.916 --> 06:14.374
I just want to make sure
there's food for all of us.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.207
Mark in Fairplay,
you had a comment?

06:16.416 --> 06:17.790
Yeah, I agree
with the last caller.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.040
I was in a restaurant
and ordered

06:19.250 --> 06:20.665
the gluten-free quinoa salad,

06:20.875 --> 06:23.124
and a guy right next to me
was eating a sandwich.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.707
It's like, "Get your secondhand
gluten away from me!"

06:25.916 --> 06:27.207
All right, all right,
next caller,

06:27.416 --> 06:28.749
you got a question
for the boys?

06:28.958 --> 06:30.707
Yeah, I swear
if I hear another person

06:30.916 --> 06:31.915
talk about about
being gluten-free,

06:32.125 --> 06:33.332
I'm gonna piss in their face.

06:33.541 --> 06:35.457
What the hell is gluten?

06:35.666 --> 06:38.540
Hello, everyone,
My name is John Garner

06:38.750 --> 06:41.332
and I'm a nutrition advisor
from the USDA.

06:41.541 --> 06:44.999
I want to clarify the USDA's
position on a healthy diet.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.749
There's been a lot of confusion
about gluten lately --

06:47.958 --> 06:49.874
people saying that gluten
is the cause of cancer,

06:50.083 --> 06:50.957
gluten should be avoided,

06:51.166 --> 06:52.207
gluten can make
your dick fly off --

06:52.416 --> 06:53.665
but let's
set the record straight.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.249
Make your dick fly off?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.665
People believe that omitting
gluten will make you healthier,

06:57.875 --> 06:59.290
but of course
that's a bunch of hooey.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.624
Hooey is the preservative
found in processed foods

07:01.833 --> 07:03.874
that we now believe is
the main culprit of obesity.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.790
You might say, "Well,
there's fat in butter too,"

07:06.000 --> 07:07.040
but that's just poppycock.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.582
Poppycock first came from India

07:08.791 --> 07:10.207
and is key ingredient
in red meat,

07:10.416 --> 07:12.749
which we now realize is
good for you along with hooey.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.332
The good hooey,
not the bad hooey.

07:14.541 --> 07:15.790
So what is gluten?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.415
Yes!
Thank you!

07:17.625 --> 07:20.624
Simply put, gluten is
the protein found in flour

07:20.833 --> 07:22.207
when you take
all the starch away.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.165
Flour is, of course, just wheat,

07:24.375 --> 07:26.457
and when you add a liquid
to flour, you get dough --

07:26.666 --> 07:28.415
dough that makes bread,
doughnuts, pasta,

07:28.625 --> 07:30.790
and all the hooey-free foods
that humans enjoy.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.915
Now, if we wash the dough
of all its starch,

07:33.125 --> 07:34.790
we can actually distill
the wheat down,

07:35.000 --> 07:36.749
minus the water,
minus the starch,

07:36.958 --> 07:38.915
and what we're left with
is pure gluten.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.457
Not a bioweapon,
just harmless flour protein.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.790
Then eat it.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.124
Excuse me?

07:47.333 --> 07:48.457
If it's not dangerous,

07:48.666 --> 07:51.582
then eat that pure,
concentrated gluten, m'kay.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.707
Uh, all right.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.665
Uh. Ah.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.832
Oh, you see that?
His dick's flying off.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.540
Aah!

08:23.750 --> 08:26.582
Oh, my God!
These people don't even know!

08:26.791 --> 08:28.124
Hurry!
You got to go!

08:28.333 --> 08:31.249
Oh, Jesus!
Hey, it isn't safe in there!

08:33.708 --> 08:35.165
- Get out of there!
- Get out! You're not safe!

08:35.375 --> 08:37.999
- You got to get out!
- Hurry! You got to go!

08:43.916 --> 08:45.624
What about PowerBars?
The PowerBars?

08:45.833 --> 08:46.957
- Yes!
- Hamburger Helper?

08:47.166 --> 08:48.915
That's all gluten!

08:49.125 --> 08:51.790
Oh, there's hot dog buns
in that cupboard, Sharon!

08:52.000 --> 08:54.124
Hey, Dad, I need to talk you
about this party we're having.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.957
Oh, my God, the Wheat Thins!

08:56.166 --> 08:57.374
And the Triscuits too,
Randy!

08:57.583 --> 08:58.790
Wait, wait.
I might need those.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.957
This stuff will make
your dick fly off, Stan!

09:01.166 --> 09:03.957
- Don't forget the freezer!
- Oh, God!

09:04.166 --> 09:06.999
Chicken nuggets -- breaded!
Frozen burritos -- flour!

09:07.208 --> 09:08.457
Ice cream!
What about ice cream?

09:08.666 --> 09:10.874
I don't know!
Look at the ingredients!

09:11.083 --> 09:12.624
Heavy cream, sugar,
chocolate syrup --

09:12.833 --> 09:14.665
No, ice cream's good for you.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.124
- All right, that's all of it!
- You sure?

09:16.333 --> 09:18.082
- All right, you got those?
- I can get both of these, yeah.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.790
All right, come on!

09:30.083 --> 09:30.957
Hey, Cartman.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.540
Kyle!
It's all gone!

09:32.750 --> 09:34.665
They've taken it all!
Why are they doing this?!

09:34.875 --> 09:37.124
- Kyle! Kyle!
- Dude, calm down.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.915
There's no snacks left, Kyle!

09:39.125 --> 09:40.790
They took all the snacks
and the pizza and the cake

09:41.000 --> 09:42.124
and we're not gonna have
a party!

09:42.333 --> 09:43.957
Who took
all the pizza and cake?

09:50.541 --> 09:51.790
What the hell?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.790
Kyle!

10:08.666 --> 10:10.290
Yeah! Get it!
Get it all!

10:10.500 --> 10:12.582
Yeah, that's it!
Burn, you bastard!

10:12.791 --> 10:14.290
What are you doing?
My farm!

10:14.500 --> 10:15.499
Son of a bitch!

10:15.708 --> 10:17.874
Did you not know
or did you just not care?!

10:18.083 --> 10:19.790
Kee-ya!

10:24.333 --> 10:25.790
There's panic
all over the country

10:26.000 --> 10:26.915
and you're telling me
you don't have

10:27.125 --> 10:28.457
any kind of containment
on this thing?

10:28.666 --> 10:29.749
We're working
as fast as we can, sir.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.582
Are you sure it's gluten

10:31.791 --> 10:32.957
that started the reaction?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.499
We gave these rats
an injection

10:34.708 --> 10:35.874
of concentrated
whole-wheat bread

10:36.083 --> 10:37.165
just a short time ago.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.790
You can see it already is having
a negative effect.

10:45.416 --> 10:48.290
We told people that
whole-wheat bread was healthy!

10:48.500 --> 10:51.332
Isn't wheat the ingredient
in pasta that makes it healthy?

10:51.541 --> 10:55.124
No. We believe now
that that's poppycock.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.332
All right, listen up!

10:56.541 --> 10:59.457
We have the obligation
to make this thing right

10:59.666 --> 11:02.499
and tell people
what is and isn't safe to eat.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.290
We are the USDA!

11:04.500 --> 11:07.790
Without us, people would be
eating dirt and chairs.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.249
Whatever it takes,
stop this crisis.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.999
Cartman, come on, dude.
You have to get up.

11:24.208 --> 11:25.582
What's the point?

11:25.791 --> 11:28.332
Everyone hates us at school
and our party's gonna suck.

11:28.541 --> 11:30.082
We can't let our party suck.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.957
What kind of epic party can
you have without pizza and cake?

11:33.166 --> 11:34.582
Now all we've got is Lorde.

11:34.791 --> 11:36.165
That's right.
We've still got Lorde.

11:36.375 --> 11:38.457
You talked to your dad,
right, Stan?

11:38.666 --> 11:40.374
I'll be back.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.624
You know what
I'm gonna miss most?

11:42.833 --> 11:44.207
Pancakes.

11:44.416 --> 11:46.165
I keep having
dreams of Aunt Jemima.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.082
She's trying to
tell me something,

11:48.291 --> 11:50.124
but then she just fades away.

11:50.333 --> 11:51.290
Cartman,
we can't do this alone.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.457
You have to get up.

11:52.666 --> 11:54.040
There's nothing left,
you guys.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.707
The world is upside down.

11:55.916 --> 11:59.665
Things aren't gonna get better.
They're gonna get worse.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.249
- Yes?
- Hello, sir.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.249
We've had word of a possible
gluten exposure in your home.

12:08.458 --> 12:09.249
May we come in?

12:09.458 --> 12:11.165
Gluten?
Oh, not here.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.249
Can we come in, please?

12:13.458 --> 12:14.082
Well, sure.

12:19.166 --> 12:20.290
What's going on?

12:26.375 --> 12:29.165
- Well, that's just a beer.
- Oh, Jesus.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.207
Beer is all wheat, Dad!

12:31.416 --> 12:33.249
Shut up!
Beer's bad for you?

12:33.458 --> 12:35.124
We're gonna need you
to come with us, sir.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.249
- Don't touch me.
- Look, I'm okay.

12:37.458 --> 12:38.582
You want to see my dick?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.582
We just need you to be
in quarantine for a while

12:40.791 --> 12:42.457
until everyone figures out
what's going on.

12:42.666 --> 12:44.582
No.
Not Papa John's!

12:44.791 --> 12:46.415
I don't want to go
to Papa John's!

12:46.625 --> 12:49.249
You can't make me go
to Papa John's!

12:51.625 --> 12:53.082
How long
do I have to stay here?

12:53.291 --> 12:56.582
Until the USDA gets
control of the situation, sir.

12:56.791 --> 12:57.999
What am I supposed to eat?

12:58.208 --> 12:59.707
It's okay.
There's lots of toppings.

12:59.916 --> 13:02.332
Just eat the toppings.

13:02.541 --> 13:03.707
How'd you get exposed?

13:03.916 --> 13:06.707
Bagels? Gravy?

13:06.916 --> 13:10.124
Beer.
I didn't know it had gluten.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.749
There's always something.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.874
For me, it was the soy sauce.

13:15.083 --> 13:18.624
Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.

13:18.833 --> 13:19.999
We're trying to get a handle

13:20.208 --> 13:21.540
on just how much gluten
there is out there,

13:21.750 --> 13:23.999
but it seems
impossible to contain.

13:24.208 --> 13:25.582
And we have no idea
how to tell people

13:25.791 --> 13:26.874
to protect themselves?

13:27.083 --> 13:28.249
We've been
running simulations,

13:28.458 --> 13:30.082
but they're problematic
because they don't relate

13:30.291 --> 13:31.082
to our current schematics.

13:31.291 --> 13:32.165
Here, look.

13:32.375 --> 13:33.707
This is what
we've been recommending

13:33.916 --> 13:34.915
for the past three years --

13:35.125 --> 13:36.499
five basic food groups,
not four.

13:36.708 --> 13:37.582
We were wrong about that.

13:37.791 --> 13:39.999
We now realize, of course,
that the largest of these groups

13:40.208 --> 13:42.415
we've been recommending
is basically poison.

13:42.625 --> 13:43.999
So to combat the gluten,

13:44.208 --> 13:45.832
we're trying
every possible combination

13:46.041 --> 13:47.040
of the four remaining
food groups,

13:47.250 --> 13:49.124
but so far no answers.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.999
Sir, the feds are here.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.374
Oh, shit.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.832
Tom Vilsack?

13:54.041 --> 13:56.165
- Yes.
- Michael Taylor, FDA.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.832
Yeah, thank you,
but this is a USDA problem.

13:59.041 --> 14:02.790
Anything involving meat
and dairy is our problem too.

14:04.916 --> 14:07.249
Dad? Dad!

14:07.458 --> 14:12.540
Stan!
Hey, how's my boy?

14:12.750 --> 14:15.040
Daddy's gonna be all right,
okay?

14:15.250 --> 14:16.540
Yeah, Dad,
you know that guy at work

14:16.750 --> 14:18.499
you said is Lorde's uncle
or something?

14:18.708 --> 14:20.915
I can't touch you
or hug you, but --

14:21.125 --> 14:21.999
but I'm right with you.

14:22.208 --> 14:23.290
Do you understand?

14:23.500 --> 14:25.374
Yeah, you remember
you said that Lorde, the singer,

14:25.583 --> 14:26.665
her uncle worked with you?

14:26.875 --> 14:28.874
How is your mom?
Y-Your sister?

14:29.083 --> 14:30.915
This is a quarantined area,
kid.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.290
You're -- You're gonna
have to go.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.499
No, no, no, not yet.
Dad!

14:33.708 --> 14:35.290
That's my son, you bastard!

14:35.500 --> 14:36.749
I'm sorry, all right?!

14:36.958 --> 14:38.707
Dad, who's the guy at work
that knows Lorde?

14:38.916 --> 14:40.040
Let me go! Dad!

14:40.250 --> 14:41.124
Stan!

14:41.333 --> 14:42.832
Let me talk to my dad!

14:43.041 --> 14:44.915
St-a-a-an!

14:48.000 --> 14:49.957
You call this a party?

14:50.166 --> 14:51.957
- Your party sucks!
- Come on, guys, let's go!

14:52.166 --> 14:54.665
No food at a party?
And I thought I was handicapped!

14:54.875 --> 14:56.749
- I hate your party!
- What's wrong with you?

14:56.958 --> 14:58.415
- Where's the food?
- Loser, loser!

14:58.625 --> 15:00.249
- Your party sucks!
- Where's the food?

15:00.458 --> 15:02.582
What a loser!

15:07.791 --> 15:10.374
Hello, Eric.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.540
Come on over here, sugar.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.040
Aunt Jemima.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.790
There's people in trouble,
Eric.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.165
They need to be shown the way.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.290
I don't know the way,
Aunt Jemima.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.457
You need to get
to the USDA, child.

15:26.666 --> 15:28.332
They lookin' for a sign.

15:28.541 --> 15:30.332
I don't even know
what that means.

15:30.541 --> 15:34.790
When you're stuck,
look to the pyramids.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.915
Are you going to eat
those pancakes?

15:37.125 --> 15:39.415
They got it wrong, child.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.915
The world is upside down.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.124
Ohh, trippy.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.457
Tell em'
they gots it backwards!

15:50.666 --> 15:52.457
They got what backwards?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.957
Agh!

15:56.166 --> 15:57.457
- This party's lame!
- I hate your party!

15:57.666 --> 16:00.332
- Loser, loser!
- Cartman's a loser!

16:02.333 --> 16:04.790
No-o-o-o!

16:05.000 --> 16:06.707
Ohh.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.040
Fuck, I want pancakes.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.749
You can't just
keep us in here!

16:18.958 --> 16:20.374
MR. - We're out.

16:20.583 --> 16:24.457
We're all out of toppings.
There's nothing left to eat.

16:24.666 --> 16:26.957
They're just gonna let us
starve to death?

16:27.166 --> 16:28.332
They don't care about us.

16:28.541 --> 16:31.874
Face it.
We're already dead to them.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.749
Well, then,
I guess I might as well eat.

16:35.958 --> 16:37.540
There's nothing left.
I told you!

16:37.750 --> 16:39.374
There's plenty of pizza dough.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.082
- Are you crazy?
- I'm crazy hungry!

16:44.833 --> 16:47.499
Oh, fuck, it's so good.

16:48.791 --> 16:51.207
I want more.

16:51.416 --> 16:53.832
Ohh, it's been so long.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.749
Oh, my God, you...

16:58.333 --> 17:01.124
But you're okay.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.624
You don't think
it's a little ridiculous

17:03.833 --> 17:05.749
that wheat protein is toxic?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.540
This whole thing
was a setup, man!

17:07.750 --> 17:09.624
A setup?
But by who?

17:09.833 --> 17:11.707
Oh, my God, we -- we have to
get ahold of someone

17:11.916 --> 17:12.957
who can get the word out!

17:13.166 --> 17:14.624
Maybe Papa John can help us.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.707
If we can get ahold of him,
then maybe we can --

17:21.750 --> 17:23.374
Aw.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.332
There's a health crisis
going on,

17:27.541 --> 17:30.207
and it's spreading
faster than anyone realizes.

17:30.416 --> 17:31.749
For a long time we ignored it,

17:31.958 --> 17:33.207
thought it would
only affect the poor,

17:33.416 --> 17:35.915
people who ate Eggo waffles
and pizza pockets,

17:36.125 --> 17:38.040
but gluten can attack anyone.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.540
This is not a time to party.
This is a time to get serious.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.124
We're calling on everyone
to spend this weekend

17:43.333 --> 17:44.290
learning about gluten

17:44.500 --> 17:46.665
and how to protect yourself
and your family,

17:46.875 --> 17:49.457
because we don't know
how much time we have.

17:49.666 --> 17:51.290
All right,
time for action indeed.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.915
Let's go to the phone lines.
Go ahead, caller.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.249
I knew you guys
were gonna bail on the party.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.082
We're not bailing
on the party.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.665
We just think there's
more important things right now.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.749
Uh-huh. You guys couldn't get
Lorde to play, could you?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.540
All right,
let's go to Jamie in Como.

18:05.750 --> 18:06.374
Go ahead.

18:06.583 --> 18:07.665
It's like you -- you say

18:07.875 --> 18:09.665
you're gonna throw the most
epic party of the decade

18:09.875 --> 18:10.790
and then you rip it away!

18:11.000 --> 18:12.707
It's kind of like
telling everyone

18:12.916 --> 18:13.707
to go fuck themselves.

18:13.916 --> 18:15.332
Okay, let's watch
the language there.

18:15.541 --> 18:17.332
Next caller, you're on the air.

18:17.541 --> 18:20.249
Why were you doing
this party, Stan?

18:20.458 --> 18:22.415
Was it because
you made people mad at school

18:22.625 --> 18:25.165
or because you just wanted
to be a big shot?

18:25.375 --> 18:27.915
I -- We -- We wanted
to bring people together

18:28.125 --> 18:29.082
and help Scott Malkinson, but --

18:29.291 --> 18:31.249
So then in a time when people
really need to come together,

18:31.458 --> 18:32.415
you cancel on him?

18:32.625 --> 18:34.999
I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson
still has diabetes.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.249
That is correct.
Yes, I do.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.249
You couldn't put on the
party you were hoping to put on,

18:39.458 --> 18:40.249
was that it?

18:40.458 --> 18:41.415
Jesus Christ, dude.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.499
Wendy, there is
a health crisis right now --

18:43.708 --> 18:46.290
Right, and when things change
or things come up,

18:46.500 --> 18:49.874
you don't forget about
everything you promised people!

18:50.083 --> 18:51.874
We had no idea what
to serve people to eat, okay?

18:52.083 --> 18:52.999
We were gonna look stupid!

18:53.208 --> 18:54.957
Thought so.

18:55.166 --> 18:55.957
Oooh!

18:56.166 --> 18:59.207
All right, next caller is Eric.
Are you there, Eric?

18:59.416 --> 19:00.915
- Kyle!
- Cartman?

19:01.125 --> 19:02.957
Kyle, what does "USDA"
stand for?!

19:03.166 --> 19:06.124
Aunt Jemima said USDA
has to look to the pyramids!

19:07.833 --> 19:09.999
It's dinnertime on the
East Coast in less than an hour.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.415
People are going to die!

19:11.625 --> 19:12.874
Sir, we've got a boy
on the hotline

19:13.083 --> 19:14.790
who says
he might know something!

19:15.000 --> 19:15.874
Who is this?

19:16.083 --> 19:17.332
My name isn't important.

19:17.541 --> 19:20.790
What matters is that
the answer is in the pyramid.

19:21.000 --> 19:21.790
The pyramid?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.665
That's ancient stuff
you're talking about.

19:23.875 --> 19:24.665
Are you sure?

19:24.875 --> 19:25.915
Bring up the pyramid!

19:28.750 --> 19:30.290
What is it?
What is it for?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.999
We built the pyramid
a long time ago

19:32.208 --> 19:33.499
to illustrate
how much people should eat

19:33.708 --> 19:35.040
of the four basic food groups.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.790
Sir, we abandoned the pyramid

19:37.000 --> 19:38.624
when Michelle Obama
got involved.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.540
The pyramid doesn't work.
We've already tried it.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.165
It's upside down.

19:43.375 --> 19:44.290
What?

19:44.500 --> 19:46.207
Sir, the pyramid
is upside down.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.499
Turn the pyramid upside down.

19:48.708 --> 19:49.499
You can't be serious.

19:49.708 --> 19:51.165
That would put butter and fat
at the top of the --

19:51.375 --> 19:52.915
Flip the damn food pyramid!

19:53.125 --> 19:55.415
This is not FDA approved!

19:55.625 --> 19:57.332
It's dinnertime on
the East Coast in 10 minutes!

19:57.541 --> 19:58.499
Now do it!

20:05.833 --> 20:07.082
Sir, we've got a match.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.915
Nutrition is stabilizing.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.999
We've got
a well-balanced vaccine, sir!

20:15.875 --> 20:18.374
Get the president
on the phone.

20:18.583 --> 20:22.832
Tell him to have some steak
with his butter.

20:38.833 --> 20:41.832
Well, I got to admit, you guys
throw a pretty sweet party.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.165
Hey, we'd do anything
for our bros, man.

20:44.375 --> 20:46.332
Would you guys care
for a frozen butter pop?

20:46.541 --> 20:48.999
We're good, Scott.
Stop bugging us.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.040
We really dodged a bullet,
young man.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.582
Thanks to you,
America knows what to eat again.

20:53.791 --> 20:55.832
Yeah, well, I'm glad people
aren't mad at you anymore.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.207
I know what that feels like.

20:57.416 --> 20:58.999
We're gonna get
a better view of the stage.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.707
Yeah, yeah.
Enjoy the party.

21:05.958 --> 21:09.165
Wait till my girls see that
I was at a party with Lorde!

21:09.375 --> 21:11.415
I'm glad the food is good.
Lorde sucks.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.124
Yeah, she isn't as hot
in person.

You guys really pulled it off.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.999
Yeah, well,
I just couldn't sit around

21:26.208 --> 21:27.499
while my dad was locked away.

21:27.708 --> 21:29.999
I love him, and he needed me.

You're so transparent, Stan.
