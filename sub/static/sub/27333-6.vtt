00:07.974 --> 00:09.603
GEOFFREY:
Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.686 --> 00:11.481
-MOLLY: Topher's gone!
-I don't think he's coming back here.

00:11.565 --> 00:13.235
This is what I wanted
to protected you from.

00:13.318 --> 00:14.655
From losing someone you care about.

00:14.738 --> 00:16.534
-Again.
-Do you know who you sound

00:16.617 --> 00:18.453
exactly like right now? Your mom.

00:18.538 --> 00:21.042
JONAH: Everything I've worked towards,
everything I've done, was for this.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.965
Karolina, I'd like to introduce you
to your brother.

00:24.048 --> 00:26.845
Mom, I need to know the truth
about my father.

00:26.929 --> 00:28.223
-Aah!
-Hey, you OK?

00:28.306 --> 00:30.687
It happens when I go off
my Sertraline too quickly.

00:30.770 --> 00:33.943
She needs you more than ever to help her
get used to being off her meds.

00:34.026 --> 00:35.028
NURSE:
Feelin' a little better?

00:35.112 --> 00:36.197
Yeah. Thank you.

00:36.281 --> 00:38.451
He said he was going
to just talk to her.

00:38.536 --> 00:40.455
ROBERT:
Jonah murdered my daughter.

00:41.457 --> 00:43.671
That was for Amy.
Now it's time to finish this.

00:43.754 --> 00:44.881
[groans]

00:44.965 --> 00:48.848
JONAH:
I believe this belongs to you.

00:50.225 --> 00:51.812
-[thud]
-[Jonah grunts]

00:51.895 --> 00:53.899
[Tina gasping]

00:55.068 --> 00:56.446
What have you done to him?

00:57.489 --> 00:59.452
I simply defended myself against

00:59.536 --> 01:01.999
another one of your pathetic attempts
to kill me.

01:02.082 --> 01:05.464
DALE:
Uh, j-just so we're on the same page,

01:05.548 --> 01:09.681
this particular attempted murder
was all Robert going rogue.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.852
I mean, you know him.
He's a loose cannon.

01:11.935 --> 01:13.480
It doesn't matter,
because the day after tomorrow,

01:13.564 --> 01:15.735
I'll never have to see
your faces ever again.

01:17.488 --> 01:19.534
Because you're gonna pull off our faces?

01:19.618 --> 01:22.582
JONAH: Do you think I chose you
because I enjoy your company?

01:23.709 --> 01:27.216
I chose you because of your
capability to perform specific tasks,

01:27.299 --> 01:30.013
so I could get my ship
out of that damn hole

01:30.097 --> 01:31.809
and get the hell outta here!

01:31.892 --> 01:34.940
Day after tomorrow, all of you
are going to show up at the dig site.

01:35.023 --> 01:37.111
Tina and Robert,
once he's recovered his senses,

01:37.194 --> 01:38.864
will repair my ship's computer system.

01:38.948 --> 01:42.329
Dale and Stacey will run diagnostics

01:42.413 --> 01:45.043
on my ship's biomorphic shell.

01:46.212 --> 01:47.256
And Victor will be roused

01:47.339 --> 01:51.723
from his slumber to oversee
any engineering issues.

01:51.807 --> 01:55.480
The Deans, of course, will provide
security so that we're not disturbed.

01:55.565 --> 01:57.359
And if we don't go along with it?

01:59.155 --> 02:00.616
I'll kill your children.

02:02.286 --> 02:03.789
You know I wouldn't hesitate.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.337
If you launch that ship,
our children will die anyway.

02:07.922 --> 02:11.680
Gene and Alice said that it
would cause a massive earthquake.

02:11.764 --> 02:15.980
The Hernandezes understood geology.
They didn't understand my ship.

02:16.815 --> 02:18.778
There will be no earthquake.

02:18.861 --> 02:21.073
As an added incentive,

02:21.157 --> 02:24.163
I'm going to leave behind
a parting gift--

02:24.246 --> 02:25.373
my Abstract.

02:25.457 --> 02:29.215
Your book of poems
written in alien code?

02:29.298 --> 02:30.467
Not much of an offer.

02:32.387 --> 02:34.851
It contains all the knowledge
my people possess.

02:35.853 --> 02:38.233
If I decode it for you,
then PRIDE can use it

02:38.316 --> 02:41.573
to finally do what it advertises...

02:41.657 --> 02:43.284
and save the world.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.459
And I'll tell you
where your children are.

02:47.544 --> 02:49.881
You can retrieve them
and go about your lives

02:49.965 --> 02:52.135
as if we never met.

02:54.473 --> 02:55.643
GEOFFREY:
You forget somethin'?

02:58.816 --> 03:00.570
You didn't give us a job on launch day.

03:01.905 --> 03:04.368
Want us to make you
a goodbye banner or some shit?

03:06.874 --> 03:08.544
You've already fulfilled your purpose.

03:08.627 --> 03:10.088
I have no further use for you.

03:21.778 --> 03:23.323
[crickets chirping]

03:23.406 --> 03:24.951
KAROLINA:
Jonah told me what he is.

03:25.035 --> 03:26.622
What I am.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.959
[Leslie sighs]

03:30.880 --> 03:34.512
[sighs] I-I'm so sorry
you had to hear that...from him.

03:36.474 --> 03:39.313
Believe me,
I wanted to tell you so many times.

03:39.396 --> 03:42.737
And you only had every day
for 17 years to do it.

03:45.785 --> 03:48.624
I don't expect you to be able
to understand, but...

03:51.505 --> 03:53.466
I loved Jonah.

03:53.550 --> 03:56.472
Trusted him, wholeheartedly.

03:57.057 --> 04:00.648
But then I discovered
what he is truly capable of.

04:00.731 --> 04:02.985
You put those kids in that box.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.075
Nobody tells Leslie Dean what to do.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.246
Yes.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.505
I was willing...to do it.

04:13.757 --> 04:15.468
At one point, you thought he was good.

04:16.555 --> 04:17.640
When did that change?

04:19.184 --> 04:20.730
When he hurt you.

04:20.813 --> 04:22.357
Mom, he was testing me.

04:22.441 --> 04:24.571
Drawing me out.
He wanted to see what I could do.

04:24.654 --> 04:25.740
LESLIE:
You almost died.

04:25.823 --> 04:28.036
-But he saved me!
-No, no, listen.

04:29.038 --> 04:32.210
He's-- he's done things.
Terrible things, Karolina.

04:32.294 --> 04:33.463
You're one to judge.

04:34.465 --> 04:36.553
Look, the sacrifices that you discovered,

04:36.636 --> 04:38.724
those lives were taken
to keep Jonah alive,

04:38.807 --> 04:40.770
but there were other deaths
that were not.

04:40.853 --> 04:43.107
Why is one murder
more OK than another?

04:43.776 --> 04:47.658
Because everything that we did
was for you kids, to protect you.

04:47.742 --> 04:49.788
We would never have hurt any of you.

04:52.627 --> 04:54.129
But Jonah...

04:58.137 --> 04:59.223
Jonah...

05:01.435 --> 05:03.272
killed Amy.

05:06.403 --> 05:08.784
That's not true.
You're lying.

05:09.911 --> 05:11.832
Oh, sweetheart, I wish I was.

05:15.130 --> 05:16.550
[monitor beeping]

05:17.635 --> 05:19.346
[low chatter]

05:29.074 --> 05:30.285
Old Lace.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.455
I know you can hear me.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.168
[low growl]

05:39.469 --> 05:42.810
-GERT: I didn't want to leave you behind.
-[Old Lace whines]

05:43.436 --> 05:45.064
Please believe me.

05:45.733 --> 05:47.152
You're such a good girl.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.959
I can-- I can feel
how much this hurts you.

05:55.043 --> 05:57.548
You didn't do anything wrong.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.345
I'm wrong.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.806
[quiet growl]

06:03.309 --> 06:04.562
I'm broken...

06:06.190 --> 06:08.987
and I was gonna get someone killed
if I didn't do something.

06:14.373 --> 06:17.128
If this goes sideways
and I have to stay away,

06:17.212 --> 06:20.761
I need you to protect the others,
especially Molly.

06:20.844 --> 06:21.846
[Old Lace grunts]

06:21.930 --> 06:23.307
She needs it.

06:24.894 --> 06:26.146
No matter what she says.

06:26.230 --> 06:27.858
NURSE:
How are we feelin'?

06:27.942 --> 06:30.614
Uh, well, my head doesn't feel
like it's being bored through

06:30.698 --> 06:33.829
by a red-hot poker, so...
that's improvement.

06:33.912 --> 06:35.582
-[chuckles]
Chase, hmm?

06:36.835 --> 06:39.131
Never known a girl named Chase before.

06:39.214 --> 06:42.178
That's some pretty backwards
gender-normative thinking.

06:42.262 --> 06:44.934
-Your mother's here,
if you're ready to see her.

06:45.018 --> 06:47.105
Be interested to meet
the woman who raised you.

06:47.690 --> 06:48.775
JANET:
Hi, honey.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.756
[theme music playing]

08:08.768 --> 08:11.524
[electronics beeping]

08:15.574 --> 08:17.578
All of the money and power in the world,

08:17.661 --> 08:21.001
and somehow we always end up
with these two playing doctor.

08:22.045 --> 08:24.634
"Playing doctor" implies we are
not trained medical professionals.

08:24.717 --> 08:26.386
You know, technically, we're not.

08:26.470 --> 08:28.224
-[Robert groans]
-Robert?

08:32.607 --> 08:35.530
TINA: Are you all right?
What do you remember?

08:36.908 --> 08:38.369
The inhibitor.

08:38.452 --> 08:41.124
It was working and... then...

08:42.919 --> 08:44.464
I don't know, everything went black.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.513
You should never have gone alone.

08:48.515 --> 08:50.309
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

08:50.811 --> 08:52.648
CATHERINE:
Well, it must have had some effect.

08:52.731 --> 08:53.942
Jonah did look pretty sick.

08:54.025 --> 08:55.612
Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll just die.

08:55.696 --> 08:59.579
Even in his weakened state,
he had no problem taking out Robert.

08:59.662 --> 09:01.164
STACEY:
Can I say something crazy?

09:01.248 --> 09:02.793
Pretty on-brand for you.

09:05.214 --> 09:08.012
What if Jonah is telling the truth?

09:08.095 --> 09:12.730
What if we can get him out of our lives
and get the Abstract and show the kids

09:12.813 --> 09:15.819
that we started this for a reason,
to help mankind!

09:15.902 --> 09:19.577
I mean, maybe if we do enough good,
they'll just come home on their own.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.123
Sounds great, but we have
a little problem of an earthquake.

09:22.206 --> 09:24.169
DALE: Well, it would make sense
that the Abstract

09:24.252 --> 09:26.381
contains schematics for the ship, right?

09:27.383 --> 09:29.847
What if we use that alongside
the Hernandezes' research

09:29.930 --> 09:32.018
and rule out an earthquake
once and for all.

09:32.101 --> 09:33.938
-Except we can't read it.
-GEOFFREY: Maybe Janet can.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.780
-I gave it to her.
-You didn't tell me that.

09:40.409 --> 09:43.625
I didn't tell anyone--
because she asked me not to.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.966
There's no way Janet is gonna crack
Jonah's secret language.

09:48.050 --> 09:50.471
If she could, though,
we could do a lot more

09:50.555 --> 09:51.766
than figure out the earthquake.

09:52.976 --> 09:55.106
DALE: We will gather up all the data
we have from Gene and Alice,

09:55.189 --> 09:56.609
and we'll see if she made any progress.

09:56.693 --> 09:58.905
GEOFFREY: Well, it looks like
you all have got everything covered,

09:58.988 --> 10:00.659
so, uh, we're gonna be on our way.

10:01.744 --> 10:04.542
You heard what Jonah said.
Our part in this is done.

10:16.189 --> 10:18.945
It's never really over with him.
You know that.

10:19.028 --> 10:21.032
I know I'm not gonna live my life
looking over my shoulder.

10:21.116 --> 10:23.621
You don't have to.
I've got your back.

10:23.705 --> 10:28.172
Just do me a favor.
Stay in touch...

10:28.255 --> 10:29.759
and stay on your guard.

10:30.426 --> 10:32.180
You don't have to worry about that.

10:48.713 --> 10:51.343
[moody pop song playing]

10:53.472 --> 10:56.604
So we broke into Atlas for this thing,

10:56.687 --> 10:58.733
and now you're stripping it for parts?

10:58.817 --> 11:01.948
No. I am adding parts,

11:02.031 --> 11:03.993
turning it from a super computer

11:04.077 --> 11:07.041
into a super-duper computer...

11:08.085 --> 11:09.254
or something like that.

11:09.337 --> 11:10.715
It's all a part of my plan.

11:12.343 --> 11:13.428
Care to let me in on it?

11:14.515 --> 11:15.725
Nope.

11:17.228 --> 11:20.359
If I tell you my plan,
then it becomes Nico's plan,

11:20.442 --> 11:22.488
and Alex is left out in the cold again.

11:22.573 --> 11:23.700
I happen to like being needed.

11:23.783 --> 11:28.250
Yeah, well, being a leader hasn't exactly
been my strong suit lately,

11:28.333 --> 11:30.797
so feel free to tag in.

11:30.881 --> 11:34.137
Leaders have to make
unpopular decisions.

11:35.139 --> 11:37.811
You were right about Topher.
He could have really hurt Molly.

11:37.895 --> 11:39.397
Yeah, I know.

11:40.692 --> 11:42.529
But instead, I really hurt her.

11:42.613 --> 11:45.200
I mean, Molly's lost a lot.

11:45.284 --> 11:47.330
You know, for anybody,
let alone a kid.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.543
How am I ever gonna
make it up to her?

11:54.845 --> 11:57.809
[chuckles]
Think you're asking the wrong guy.

11:59.772 --> 12:03.947
I mean, I've been trying to make it up
to you for a long time, and...

12:04.030 --> 12:05.617
I still haven't gotten anywhere.

12:09.541 --> 12:11.378
Well, maybe I should
give it another try.

12:17.724 --> 12:19.728
With Molly, I mean.

12:21.356 --> 12:22.734
Right.

12:23.318 --> 12:24.613
[laughs softly]

12:40.895 --> 12:41.939
NICO:
Molly?

12:49.830 --> 12:50.832
Molly?

12:53.713 --> 12:55.090
Molly!

12:57.178 --> 12:58.180
MOLLY:
What?

12:59.767 --> 13:01.269
NICO:
Molly, there you are.

13:02.898 --> 13:05.069
MOLLY: Am I not allowed
to walk around freely anymore?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.616
Please give me a list of rooms
I'm restricted to.

13:10.622 --> 13:12.124
I thought you ran away again.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.087
Like you would even care.

13:16.341 --> 13:19.180
I would, hence my frantic yelling.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.769
What were you doing in there?

13:21.852 --> 13:25.234
Old Lace, can you please tell Nico
that I'm not missing,

13:25.317 --> 13:26.862
but Gert and Chase are.

13:27.697 --> 13:29.075
What? Where are they?

13:29.785 --> 13:33.918
I don't know. Maybe they got tired
of living with a cabrona prejuiciosa.

13:36.757 --> 13:38.970
-A judgmental asshole.
-I got it.

13:42.434 --> 13:46.067
-Where are they, girl?
-[Old Lace growling]

13:53.749 --> 13:55.587
Hey! Thank God you called.

13:56.337 --> 13:58.759
I was freaking out when I woke up
and you were gone.

13:58.843 --> 14:00.053
What'd you do?

14:00.137 --> 14:01.264
Something bad.

14:21.639 --> 14:25.020
I'm not gonna force you
to come with me, sweetheart.

14:25.103 --> 14:27.024
No offense, Mom,
but I don't really see a universe

14:27.107 --> 14:28.193
where that'd be possible.

14:28.276 --> 14:33.788
I take ownership for everything
that we put you through,

14:33.871 --> 14:37.294

that I'm willing to pay any price--

14:37.378 --> 14:40.175

to the police--

14:40.258 --> 14:43.516
to get you to trust me again
and to consider coming home.

14:43.599 --> 14:45.018
It's too late.

14:45.102 --> 14:46.312
Too much has happened.

You care about her a lot, don't you?

-JANET: I'm glad that you found someone

15:01.175 --> 15:05.100
and that you kids are taking care
of each other, but...

15:07.522 --> 15:10.444
they're not your family,
we are.

15:10.528 --> 15:12.489
Your father and me.

15:15.997 --> 15:17.959
-How is Dad?
-JANET: He's OK.

15:19.045 --> 15:21.007
When he's back on his feet,
everything will be different.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.092
He'll be different.

15:22.176 --> 15:23.888

Get off the car.

15:34.283 --> 15:35.828
JANET:
Jonah needs another sacrifice.

15:36.872 --> 15:38.876
-What?
-He's desperate,

15:38.959 --> 15:41.464
and we have no way
to keep tabs on him,

15:41.548 --> 15:43.803
and he built another box,
and he's gonna put somebody in it,

15:43.886 --> 15:47.267
-and I can't let it be you.

Eternity, unity, belonging.

Each week, we gather
to celebrate the most important ritual

16:16.450 --> 16:19.456
to our community:
the Coruscation Ceremony.

16:19.958 --> 16:23.674
And I invite each of you
to join me this afternoon

16:23.757 --> 16:27.682
as we welcome yet another initiate
out of the shadows

16:27.765 --> 16:32.316

and the safety of the Light.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.839
Today is about our family.

16:43.923 --> 16:46.553
And what better way to celebrate
such an occasion

16:46.637 --> 16:49.517
than welcoming back one
of our most cherished members,

16:49.601 --> 16:54.611
who has spent her time
in solitude meditating and refocusing

16:54.694 --> 16:57.992
so that she can be at her best
for all of you.

my best to isolate myself

17:23.001 --> 17:25.548
from the noise of the outside world,

17:25.631 --> 17:30.808
to once again make myself
an open conduit to the Light.

17:30.891 --> 17:36.653
And I have watched
with such pride as my husband

17:36.737 --> 17:39.408
has kept our community together.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.955
I am so pleased to rejoin him

17:42.039 --> 17:45.170
and to go forth as a partnership,

especially you.

break up or something?

recovering from the dig site.

ALEX: So, what's the plan?
We just walk into the church

26:04.793 --> 26:06.589

is being held?

find another room, too.

[shower running]

27:57.434 --> 27:58.938
Jason!

27:59.021 --> 28:03.196
I don't pay you $70,000 a year
to dry off with toilet paper, man.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.200
Where the hell
are the Turkish bath towels?

28:06.369 --> 28:07.622
[huffs]

28:07.706 --> 28:10.127
They don't put up with this shit
in the Palisades.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.672
[distant clatter]

28:15.805 --> 28:17.809
[shower continues running]

29:05.153 --> 29:07.032
[Geoffrey choking]

29:10.288 --> 29:11.959
[Geoffrey groans]

29:16.384 --> 29:18.430
[gurgling]

29:25.235 --> 29:28.534
I-I didn't even know that you were
interested in alien crypto-analysis.

29:29.243 --> 29:30.538
JANET:
It's just a hobby.

29:30.621 --> 29:33.878
DALE: Can I be there when you explain
to Tina that you figured all this out?

29:35.757 --> 29:37.635
JANET:
Why are you here again?

29:37.719 --> 29:38.763
Oh, well--

29:38.846 --> 29:42.478
We need to find out if Jonah's ship
will actually cause a massive earthquake,

29:42.562 --> 29:44.941
because if not, then all
of our problems are solved,

29:45.025 --> 29:47.446
and he can just go back
to wherever he came from.

29:47.530 --> 29:50.368
A whole planet of smooth-faced men
in well-tailored pants.

29:50.452 --> 29:54.376
And we can use the Abstract to move
mankind ahead thousands of years.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.842
That sounds too good to be true,
like most of Jonah's promises.

29:57.926 --> 30:01.600
And we don't need to worry about
what will happen when the ship launches

30:01.683 --> 30:05.190
because I'm gonna use
the Abstract to shut it down...

30:07.529 --> 30:08.697
for good.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.494
DALE:
You think you can do that?

30:11.578 --> 30:14.166
Not alone. But with Victor's help,
absolutely.

30:14.250 --> 30:18.717
Oh! You'll have Victor's help--
the Victor who is in a coma.

30:18.801 --> 30:20.428
JANET:
Just leave it to me.

30:21.013 --> 30:23.393
Right now,
I'm the only chance we've got.

30:24.521 --> 30:25.731
Oh, God.

30:26.817 --> 30:28.361
I-I'm sorry. I just--

30:28.444 --> 30:30.282
I just don't know
what the right play here is.

30:30.365 --> 30:33.789
I mean, Jonah said that he knows
where our kids are,

30:33.873 --> 30:35.710
and if that's true,
and we don't do what he says,

30:35.793 --> 30:38.674
I'm terrified at what he might do.

30:38.757 --> 30:40.720
It's just killing me,
all this uncertainty,

30:40.803 --> 30:41.847
and Gert and Molly,

30:41.930 --> 30:44.226
you know, they're strong girls,
and thank God they have each other,

30:44.310 --> 30:46.857
but who knows what they're
going through or how they're coping?

30:46.940 --> 30:48.026
JANET: I do.

30:54.371 --> 30:57.336
And they're fine. Gert is fine.

30:59.131 --> 31:00.342
-How...
-How would you know that?

31:00.425 --> 31:02.262
Because I've seen her.

31:02.346 --> 31:03.849
DALE: What?

31:03.933 --> 31:08.107
She called me to help her
sign out meds at the hospital,

31:08.191 --> 31:09.611
and I was happy to help.

31:10.696 --> 31:14.829
And, get this, I think that
she and Chase are an item.

31:14.913 --> 31:16.875
Isn't that sweet?

31:16.959 --> 31:19.046
STACEY:
What the hell are you saying?

31:19.129 --> 31:20.925
I thought this would make you happy.

31:21.258 --> 31:24.599
Happy? That you saw
my daughter and didn't tell me?

31:25.433 --> 31:26.853
I'm telling you now.

31:26.937 --> 31:29.943
STACEY: Happy that you had her,
and you let her go and--

31:30.026 --> 31:32.447
Why would she call you anyway?
What have you ever done for anyone?

31:32.532 --> 31:35.495
You couldn't even protect
your own son from his father!

31:35.579 --> 31:36.999
-Babe--
-Let's go.

31:40.548 --> 31:42.635
LESLIE:
Your journey has led you here.

31:47.436 --> 31:50.108
You have one last step to take.

31:50.191 --> 31:52.947
Now, to complete the ceremony,
step into the font.

31:53.782 --> 31:56.120
FRANK: Let its gentle white light
envelop you.

32:00.295 --> 32:01.882
Your community is with you.

32:06.015 --> 32:08.979
-[whooshing sound]
-[congregants gasp]

32:10.065 --> 32:12.069
[all murmuring]

32:17.955 --> 32:19.959
[Jonah grunting]

32:23.299 --> 32:24.511
JONAH:
Yeah.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.880
Go ahead, guys.
I'll catch up with you.

32:53.109 --> 32:54.988
FRANK:
You're witnessing a miracle, everyone.

32:55.071 --> 32:58.286
Don't be afraid. Rejoice!

32:58.369 --> 33:02.002
[exclaiming joyfully]

33:07.095 --> 33:10.185
-I think this is the right room.
- Only one way to find out.

33:14.276 --> 33:16.740
-NICO: What do you see?
-CHASE: Not exactly sure.

33:18.367 --> 33:20.623
FRANK: Do you see what we
are capable of when we're together?

33:20.706 --> 33:23.670
-I don't think this is us.
-It definitely is.

33:25.131 --> 33:26.718
[congregants applauding]

33:26.801 --> 33:28.513
[cheering]

33:39.243 --> 33:42.040
ALEX: This should open it up
without drawing too much attention.

33:42.123 --> 33:43.125
[beeping]

33:43.209 --> 33:44.253
[door unlocks]

33:49.597 --> 33:51.392
NICO: Whoa.

33:51.475 --> 33:52.895
ALEX: What the hell?

33:53.939 --> 33:55.693
MOLLY: What is this place?

33:56.820 --> 33:57.905
[clank]

33:57.989 --> 33:59.199
Dad?

34:01.245 --> 34:02.999
ALEX:
If Jonah's in that one...

34:03.082 --> 34:04.961
We've gotta get
this one open. Fast.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.005
[door opens]

34:07.007 --> 34:08.802
KAROLINA:
The ceremony's in its final stage.

34:09.554 --> 34:10.556
Bend to my will.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.226
-[machine whirring]
-Now, Molly.

34:14.228 --> 34:16.065
[metal creaking]

34:16.900 --> 34:18.864
[machine powers down]

34:20.158 --> 34:21.536
ALEX:
Holy shit. Dad!

34:23.915 --> 34:25.251
MOLLY:
I got this. [grunts]

34:25.960 --> 34:27.590
CHASE: Wilder, need you
to come come check this out.

34:27.672 --> 34:29.217
Think I can figure out how
to get this open.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.386
NICO:
Chase, we have to go.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.474
The ceremony is over.
People will be coming.

34:32.558 --> 34:36.023
Wait, are you serious? We're saving
Wilder's dad, but not mine?

34:37.025 --> 34:39.614
It looks like this tank is
the only thing that's keeping him alive.

34:39.697 --> 34:41.408
If we mess with it,

34:41.492 --> 34:43.496
we might end up
doing more harm than good.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.257
Maybe we'll come back for him.

34:55.228 --> 34:57.315
-Chase?
-CHASE: I had to say goodbye

34:57.399 --> 34:59.529
to both of my parents again today.

35:01.281 --> 35:03.494
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

35:38.022 --> 35:39.650
[knocking on door]

35:43.449 --> 35:47.415
-GERT: Are you OK?
-CHASE: Aces. Why?

35:54.555 --> 35:55.933
GERT:
What are you working on?

35:57.686 --> 35:59.356
Upgrading the Fistigons.

36:03.657 --> 36:05.284
Um...

36:06.495 --> 36:08.082
Chase, I'm sorry.

36:10.002 --> 36:11.881
How many times
am I gonna have to say that?

36:13.969 --> 36:17.016
Actually, that's the first time
you've said it.

36:21.526 --> 36:24.030
I've been so trapped
in my own mind that it...

36:26.076 --> 36:28.915
it's kept me from seeing that you
were trapped in there with me.

36:29.667 --> 36:33.007
And even with my anxiety under control,
I'm terrified out here.

36:33.842 --> 36:34.927
So am I.

36:36.598 --> 36:40.229
So wouldn't it be better if we're--
if we're terrified together?

36:41.189 --> 36:43.319
I'm busy.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.031
We can talk later.

36:49.749 --> 36:50.834
OK.

37:04.695 --> 37:07.325
[distant laughter, chatter]

37:13.505 --> 37:14.757

37:50.537 --> 37:52.248
[panting]

37:54.670 --> 37:56.298
-Am I--
-Healed?

37:58.260 --> 38:00.306
I think you have been for a while.

38:00.389 --> 38:03.103
[exhales]
I was gonna say dreaming.

38:04.857 --> 38:06.778
[breathes deeply]

38:06.861 --> 38:08.489
Oh, my love.

38:10.326 --> 38:13.290
-What can I do to repay you?
-JANET: It's fine.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.756
-You feel OK?
-Yeah.

38:17.716 --> 38:19.344
Good.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.348
'Cause we have a lot of work to do.

38:21.431 --> 38:22.559
What do you mean?

38:24.104 --> 38:26.316
I've never done anything
to help our son.

38:28.028 --> 38:29.364
Or anyone.

38:30.116 --> 38:31.744
But that stops now.

38:32.704 --> 38:34.667
We're gonna shut down that ship.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.044
VOICEMAIL:
You've reached Geoffrey Wilder.

38:36.128 --> 38:37.130
Leave a message.

38:37.213 --> 38:38.215
[beep]

38:38.298 --> 38:40.302
If you stood me up
for no good reason,

38:40.386 --> 38:41.931
I'm gonna kill you.

38:42.014 --> 38:44.269
I mean, I'm gonna be really mad.

38:44.979 --> 38:46.607
I am really mad.

38:47.985 --> 38:50.197
If...you have a good reason,

38:50.281 --> 38:52.118
and something has happened to you...

38:53.370 --> 38:54.582
call me back.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.592
Where the hell are you?

39:29.067 --> 39:31.697
[rock song playing]

39:40.464 --> 39:42.301
[Geoffrey grunts]

39:46.226 --> 39:47.311
Alex?

39:49.984 --> 39:51.152
You saved me?

39:53.448 --> 39:55.829
[scoffs] No. No, I didn't save you.

39:55.912 --> 39:57.248
I kidnapped you.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.837
Now we can call it even.

40:03.385 --> 40:04.972
[grunting]

40:05.557 --> 40:06.809
[sighs]

40:11.318 --> 40:12.821
What are you gonna do with me?

40:16.369 --> 40:20.587
I ask the questions.
I make the rules.

40:22.048 --> 40:23.676
You're under my roof now.

40:33.821 --> 40:35.449
[sighs deeply]

40:37.078 --> 40:38.915
[door hinges creaking]

40:43.173 --> 40:46.012
Sorry. I'm a little on edge.

40:47.473 --> 40:48.893
I didn't mean to wake you.

40:51.524 --> 40:55.030
So you were just gonna
sneak in here and watch me sleep?

40:56.366 --> 40:57.493
Creepy.

40:59.873 --> 41:01.544
I don't know why I came in here.

41:03.130 --> 41:04.340
[pats bed]

41:14.277 --> 41:15.487
I've been thinking.

41:16.949 --> 41:19.872
We're living in dangerous times,

41:19.955 --> 41:22.878
and we need our rest, so...

41:23.880 --> 41:28.180
if the only way
we can sleep is...together,

41:28.263 --> 41:32.062
then...
maybe we should just give in.

41:34.484 --> 41:36.321
I'm really happy to hear you say that.

41:40.037 --> 41:41.749
But...

41:41.832 --> 41:44.253
you're gonna have to sleep
on Old Lace's pillow.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.513
Or, you know, I mean--

41:48.596 --> 41:50.642
I can just take this gross dinosaur pillow

41:50.725 --> 41:52.938
if you're gonna be so dramatic.

41:53.188 --> 41:54.858
I've been lying to you.

41:59.075 --> 42:00.285
I know you have.

42:03.793 --> 42:07.634
I just keep burying things, and,
um, I can't do it anymore.

42:08.761 --> 42:10.974
Karolina, you can tell me anything.

42:14.731 --> 42:16.317
I've been meeting with Jonah.

42:18.948 --> 42:20.075
What?

42:20.158 --> 42:22.329
At first it was just to...

42:22.413 --> 42:25.127
figure out more about my powers
and what I am,

42:25.210 --> 42:28.759
but then... knowing
the terrible things he did,

42:28.843 --> 42:31.139
I started to care about him.

42:32.141 --> 42:35.314
He showed me what was
at the bottom of that hole--

42:35.397 --> 42:37.944
my family...

42:38.028 --> 42:40.032
beings of light
that are actually like me.

42:42.829 --> 42:45.500
So then I went to my mom, because
I needed to know if I could trust him

42:45.585 --> 42:48.883
and if I should be helping him free
my family, not...

42:48.966 --> 42:50.720
burying them alive.

42:53.058 --> 42:55.521
Well-- like, why didn't you
tell me any of this?

42:58.318 --> 42:59.988
Because there's something else...

43:01.324 --> 43:04.330
...and after I tell you,
nothing will ever be the same,

43:04.413 --> 43:07.169
and I don't want that
because I've never been this--

43:07.252 --> 43:10.510
as happy as I am now with you.

43:11.512 --> 43:12.681
Hey.

43:13.933 --> 43:16.730
Nothing is gonna change, OK?

43:18.191 --> 43:20.947
Whatever it is, we can handle it.

43:22.449 --> 43:23.536
Just tell me.

43:28.587 --> 43:31.050
Jonah. He killed Amy.

43:39.150 --> 43:41.195
Please say something.

43:41.279 --> 43:42.699
Did I do the right thing
by telling you?

43:42.782 --> 43:44.285
Please tell me that I did.

43:45.997 --> 43:48.836
Yes...

43:48.919 --> 43:50.590
you did the right thing.

43:54.973 --> 43:56.350
I'm sorry, Nico.

43:58.773 --> 44:01.277
I'm so glad that this is finally over.
