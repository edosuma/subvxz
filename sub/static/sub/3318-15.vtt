00:38.672 --> 00:40.472
The girl's been fed on. Chosen.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.207
She couldn't be.
If she was chosen,

00:42.209 --> 00:43.609
She wouldn't
have survived.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.082
Does francis know

00:50.084 --> 00:51.617
No, and he can't.

(door opens)
servant: Lady kenna,
your majesty.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.298
You didn't come to me
last night,

01:39.300 --> 01:40.432
As we discussed.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.667
Is something wrong?
Have I offended?

01:41.669 --> 01:43.235
You hurt me
last time I was here.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.204
You don't look hurt.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.239
Is it your shoulder?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.274
I left your arms bound
behind your back too long.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.709
Sorry. My mistake.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.345
Our games are new adventures
for me, too, but...

01:53.347 --> 01:56.415
Aren't they fun?
I prefer the
use of my arms.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.683
Remember there
was once a time

01:57.685 --> 01:59.284
When you wanted
every limb in play.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.652
Good point.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.554
Use them all today.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.789
Tonight is first light.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.257
I should help
mary get ready.

02:05.259 --> 02:08.160
You should
remember our deal.

02:08.162 --> 02:11.196
I might have someone
wonderful for you to meet,

02:11.198 --> 02:13.565
This very night.
In fact, I have a whole

02:13.567 --> 02:16.301
List of eligible,
and rich, bachelors.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.570
All I ask...

02:18.572 --> 02:20.405
Is that you indulge me.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.841
Anna, this is kenna.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.577
Kenna, this is my
new friend, anna.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.213
She cost a fortune.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.515
Isn't she lovely?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.152
Yes. Lovely.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.593
I see a lust in your eyes

02:41.595 --> 02:43.428
That will not be
easily extinguished.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.830
Luckily,

02:44.832 --> 02:47.566
Lady kenna is
here to help.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.902
Are you serious?

02:49.904 --> 02:51.737
Anna will be gentler
than I've been of late.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.305
I promise you that.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.441
And... I'll make it
worth your while.

Well, what do you mean,

03:57.304 --> 03:58.370
You're not going?

03:58.372 --> 03:59.571
How can I attend a feast

03:59.573 --> 04:01.440
When I can barely
look at food?

04:01.442 --> 04:03.742
First light isn't about food.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.478
It's about men. Suitors.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.013
If a man offers
a woman a candle,

04:08.015 --> 04:10.482
It shows his intention to
court her, and if she accepts...

04:10.484 --> 04:12.918
She lights it in
her window, I know.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.254
And I know I have
to find a husband

04:15.256 --> 04:17.489
Before anyone realizes
I'm pregnant.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.491
Francis, or my
future husband.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.660
I don't want to become a
future king's property

04:21.662 --> 04:23.262
Just because I
made a mistake.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.430
An enormous mistake, I am aware.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.932
If a quick marriage
is the solution

04:26.934 --> 04:28.400
For your problems,

04:28.402 --> 04:30.302
You must make
the most of tonight.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.371
I even have a suitor
for you to meet.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.839
Who?

04:33.841 --> 04:36.842
He's a count that francis
and I met on our travels.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.577
His name is philipe nardeen.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.445
What's he like?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.414
He's a man of age to wed.

04:42.416 --> 04:46.518
He also seems charming
and well-read and kind.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.054
But please,
you must understand,

04:49.056 --> 04:52.291
It might take some time for
your feelings for him to grow.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.925
After our marriage.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.427
That's if I'm lucky enough

04:55.429 --> 04:57.596
To have him feel
anything for me.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.731
He'd be the lucky one.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.035
I can't stay long.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.536
First light's keeping
everyone busy.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.871
Loads of special cakes

05:05.873 --> 05:07.873
And tarts being
ordered as gifts.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.609
I suppose it takes more
than an impressive candle

05:10.611 --> 05:13.645
To catch a lady's eye
these days. In fact,

05:13.647 --> 05:15.414
Someone's back at court,
hoping to catch yours.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.616
Really? And who is that?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.618
The very rich and decidedly
titled lord castleroy.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.420
You mean peppercorn?

05:21.422 --> 05:23.822
That's what I called him,
but I was corrected.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.024
The gentleman with
a singular interest in his

05:26.026 --> 05:27.759
Pepper trade, you said.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.561
But I disagree, he's
also interested in you.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.397
I think I made it clear
that I'm not interested in him.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.499
But you haven't been
courted by another.
Except you.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.967
I don't count, though, do I?

05:37.937 --> 05:39.638
(soft laugh)

05:39.640 --> 05:43.642
I don't say that to pain you.
But it does.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.445
It hurts knowing
that we can't be together.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.680
Ever, really.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.084
As long as not being
together feels like this...

05:52.086 --> 05:54.353
I'm all right.

05:58.725 --> 06:02.561
When will you grow tired
of kisses that lead nowhere?

06:02.563 --> 06:05.997
When you stop wishing
they could lead somewhere.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.367
Oh, I-I almost forgot,

06:08.369 --> 06:10.001
This letter came for you
from scotland.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.003

Olivia,

06:36.897 --> 06:38.997
Do you think you could
speak of it yet?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.565
What happened
to you?

06:40.567 --> 06:41.900
It won't help me.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.710
Perhaps it will help another.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.947
When the castle was taken,

06:55.949 --> 06:57.616
I was told to wait
in the tunnels

06:57.618 --> 06:58.817
To help others to safety.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.553
<i>But I didn't.</i>

07:01.555 --> 07:03.889
<i>I fled,</i>
<i>fearing for my own life.</i>

07:03.891 --> 07:05.891
<i>And then I saw her.</i>
<i>Nostradamus:</i> <i>Her?</i>

07:05.893 --> 07:08.593
A girl, a ghost...

07:08.595 --> 07:11.596
I've no idea. There was
something covering her face.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.998
<i>And I ran.</i>

07:13.000 --> 07:14.866
<i>I was lost for hours,</i>

07:14.868 --> 07:17.102
<i>But somehow I found</i>
<i>my way out into the woods.</i>

07:17.104 --> 07:19.738
<i>I was found</i>
<i>by peasants. Hunters.</i>

07:19.740 --> 07:21.506
I asked them to help me,
but they said

07:21.508 --> 07:22.741
That I needed to help them.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.110
They grabbed me,
held me for...

07:25.112 --> 07:27.646
A few days, I think,

07:27.648 --> 07:30.882
While they watched the moon
and spoke of the darkness.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.118
You mean the night?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.620
No, I mean the darkness.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.788
A being.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.624
Some...

07:39.626 --> 07:41.460
Creature.

07:41.462 --> 07:44.162
I stayed awake
for as long as I could,

07:44.164 --> 07:46.198
But at some point,
I closed my eyes, and...

07:46.200 --> 07:48.033
<i>When I woke up,</i>

07:48.035 --> 07:50.502
<i>I was on the cold ground,</i>
<i>bound.</i>

07:50.504 --> 07:52.871
<i>There was no light.</i>

07:52.873 --> 07:56.942
<i>And it fed on me</i>
<i>night after night.</i>

08:00.613 --> 08:02.013
I'm not sure
how much time passed.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.116
You were gone for months.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.220
I barely ate.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.921
I drank a...

08:09.923 --> 08:12.724
A bitter liquid just to survive.

08:12.726 --> 08:16.061
Usually it put me back
into a state of sleep.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.096
Of nightmares.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.633
And yet it kept you alive.
Then, one day,

08:21.635 --> 08:23.201
My bonds were looser
than before.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.671
Because you were
nearly starved.
I was free.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.007
I could barely stand
at first, but I made it out.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.510
To a stream, where I drank,
and I found the strength

08:31.512 --> 08:32.978
To run for my life.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.951
Rowan:
<i>Are you sure you need</i>
<i>to go so soon?</i>

08:39.953 --> 08:41.987
The moon will be
full tomorrow night.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.655
Good hunting.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.124
That same moon will make it
easier for those hunting me.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.693
You mean your brother,
the prince?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.631
You may have guessed
the truth of my past,

08:52.633 --> 08:54.199
But I don't like
to talk about it.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.867
Or mary.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.702
A bastard and a beautiful queen,

08:57.704 --> 08:59.604
Born to rule scotland
and someday France.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.973
Who would have thought it
wouldn't work out between you?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.575
I'd be sad for you

09:03.577 --> 09:05.043
If I didn't think
you're better off

09:05.045 --> 09:07.112
Away from the vipers at court.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.650
Did you love her that much?

09:11.652 --> 09:14.286
You are leaving
France, aren't you?

09:20.092 --> 09:22.160
As fast as my legs
will take me.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.698
I'd be a poor
houseguest if I didn't

09:26.700 --> 09:29.067
Thank you for...
Oh, my god.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.937
Is that blood?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.139
Did the blood
cult do this?

09:34.141 --> 09:37.275
Rowan, tell
me the truth.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.011
It means my family
has been chosen.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.180
One of us will be
sacrificed to the darkness.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.585
These beliefs, these
misguided terrors,

09:46.587 --> 09:49.087
They've threatened others
I've known and cared about.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.823
I won't let anyone hurt
you or your family.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.693
Whatever it is,
we have to fight.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.760
We?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.028

11:09.970 --> 11:14.172
Kenna:
I was drinking...
Too much wine.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.241
I thought it would help me get
through it, and when I awoke...

11:16.243 --> 11:19.411
Oh, you saw your playmate here
in worse shape than you.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.446
What makes you sure
the king did this?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.248
He has asked me
to choke him before.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.250
He has...

11:25.252 --> 11:27.452
An interest in it.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.188
But I couldn't...

11:30.190 --> 11:32.991
Did you tell anyone
about this girl?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.459
No.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.294
There wasn't a moment to,
and I wouldn't.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.164
If you were seen with her
by the servants or anyone,

11:39.166 --> 11:42.333
You say that you saw her leave
the king's chambers.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.070
Up and walking on her own.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.472
She mentioned
getting paid well,

11:47.474 --> 11:51.276
Sharing her new wealth
with a-a relative far away.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.078
Do you understand?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.946
We're not going
to tell anyone?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.414
The king already knows.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.483
Who else would we tell?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.087
The castle
looks beautiful.

12:02.089 --> 12:06.024
As long as I don't look
at the food.

12:06.026 --> 12:09.127
Look at count nardeen.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.110
Pomegranate tart,
your grace?
Oh, thank you.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.978
If I may?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.379
My sister ate ten
of these a day,

12:28.381 --> 12:30.381
And she was with child
in less than a month.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.150
Oh.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.384
Ten a day? Are you sure

12:33.386 --> 12:35.086
The change
in your sister's figure

12:35.088 --> 12:36.755
Didn't have more to do
with butter and sugar

12:36.757 --> 12:39.157
Than with her husband?

12:42.094 --> 12:44.362
Thank you.
Not at all.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.964
She only meant to help.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.332
There are two nations

12:47.334 --> 12:49.801
That are very excited
for us to have a family.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.237
Two nations?
Is that all?

12:52.239 --> 12:54.038
Is that lola
with philipe nardeen?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.907
It is. I invited
him to court.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.544
He looks very happy to be here,
very interested.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.479
I thought he might make
a good suitor for her.

13:01.481 --> 13:05.784
Not the man I would
have picked for her.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.386
Let's dance, shall we?

13:08.388 --> 13:09.921
Food's delicious.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.222
Would you like
something?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.091
No. Please.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.493
You don't care for
our french cuisine?

13:15.495 --> 13:18.496
Or perhaps you don't
care for France?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.365
Well, everything
looks beautiful

13:20.367 --> 13:23.268
When viewed through
a castle window, doesn't it?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.470
But you see beyond that.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.405
I think about the people

13:27.407 --> 13:30.074
Who live outside
the castle walls sometimes.

13:30.076 --> 13:33.278
Do you imagine they're more free
to live life as they please?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.346
I don't know.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.249
I think they're still
bound by society's rules.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.518
By the church's.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.420
I like you.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.123
You're very direct.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.492
It's just that I have
very little time to waste.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.127
It's become apparent

13:49.129 --> 13:52.163
That the security of my position
demands a wife and heir.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.498
How romantic.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.501
Hardly...
But I can be.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.570
Under the right circumstances.

13:58.572 --> 14:02.407
If time weren't an issue
and choice of one's mate

14:02.409 --> 14:05.510
Could be driven
solely by one's heart.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.047
But my father has
threatened my inheritance

14:09.049 --> 14:10.582
Unless I marry this year.

14:10.584 --> 14:12.951
He says it's
well past time.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.553
(chuckles)
I know he's right.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.856
Well, at least
you agree on that.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.390
We don't agree
on much else.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.259
(both laugh)

14:22.561 --> 14:24.295
You are beautiful.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.369
Mary was right on
so many counts.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.606
You'll have
to look in my window

14:34.608 --> 14:37.108
To see if the flame
of love burns.

14:37.110 --> 14:41.579
Perhaps it would be enough
for us to be amusing companions.

14:41.581 --> 14:46.951
♪ just a stone's throw
from the old place... ♪

14:46.953 --> 14:48.987
I have an invitation for you.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.989
This hardly
seems the place.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.924
From lord castleroy.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.959
He's had a table set for two.

14:54.961 --> 14:58.229
He asks that you join him.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.164
♪ without protest

15:00.166 --> 15:01.933
♪ what's done is done.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.468

15:03.470 --> 15:06.337

a lady of your station.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.340
You must sit, relax,
enjoy a meal.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.209
Enjoy being served.

15:11.211 --> 15:15.346
Did you notice anything
different this evening?

15:15.348 --> 15:19.350
Uh... You look clean-shaven.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.352
Or, uh, maybe it's your hair?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.421
(laughs):
Yes, well, I tried.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.189
Thank you for noticing,
but... (laughs)

15:25.191 --> 15:26.958
What I meant was...
(clears throat) no peppers!

15:26.960 --> 15:29.360
In any way,
shape or form.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.362
I detected your lack
of taste for the plant,

15:31.364 --> 15:33.698
And the subject,
when we last met.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.566
I wanted to demonstrate
that there is... (clears throat)

15:35.568 --> 15:37.302
More to the man
than what occupies him

15:37.304 --> 15:39.170
In professional life.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.605
I'm impressed.

15:40.607 --> 15:44.442
Boy, more wine,
if you please.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.947
It makes me so happy
to see you again,

15:48.949 --> 15:52.483
And on tonight
of all nights.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.053
No better op...

15:56.088 --> 15:58.389
(sighs)

15:58.391 --> 16:00.224
No better opportunity
than first light

16:00.226 --> 16:05.396
To profess one's intentions,
to offer one's heart.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.465
Lord castleroy...

16:07.467 --> 16:09.000
Aloysius,

16:09.002 --> 16:10.468
Please.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.338
Lady greer, am I pleasing you

16:13.340 --> 16:14.672
Tonight?

16:15.741 --> 16:17.208
You're on fire.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.676
Well, I take that
as a good sign.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.578
No, no, no.
You're on fire!
Oh, oh.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.047
Oh. Oh.
(groaning)

16:23.049 --> 16:25.416
(yelling)

16:25.418 --> 16:27.018
(groaning)

16:27.020 --> 16:28.486
Are you all right?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.154
Yes. Yeah, quite,
thank you.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.557
Uh, thanks
to our friend here.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.192
And you, leith?

16:34.194 --> 16:36.094
Are you burned?
Uh, no, I'm-I'm fine.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.030
You're more than fine.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.631
No, that took courage,
that took selflessness.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.300
I-I can't thank you enough.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.769
But you-you, you know,
you have truly, my lord.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.305
Uh, I'd have done it for anyone.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.213
England, scotland,

16:55.215 --> 16:57.215
Calais, dover...

16:57.217 --> 16:58.649
Henry?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.651
Not now. I'm busy.

17:00.653 --> 17:05.056
Kenna just
spoke with me.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.758
About a guest that
you have in your room.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.395
Ah. I much prefer kenna's mouth
to be used for other purposes.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.730
When is that english bitch
going to die, hmm?

17:12.732 --> 17:16.434
She's sick, she feels better,
she's sick, she feels better.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.403
Sorry. Who...?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.738
You mean mary tudor?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.607
I don't know.

17:22.609 --> 17:26.077
Henry, there is a dead
girl in your chambers.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.415
What has this
to do with me, hmm?

17:30.417 --> 17:33.084
Another woman fell
from your window,

17:33.086 --> 17:35.520
And you said it
was an accident.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.056
And now this one-- she...

17:40.592 --> 17:43.127
She was choked to death.

17:43.129 --> 17:45.096
Henry, did you murder them?

17:45.098 --> 17:47.098
Did you murder them both?

17:47.100 --> 17:50.068
I'm concerned
with the fate of nations,

17:50.070 --> 17:52.236
And you interrupt me
with news of guests,

17:52.238 --> 17:53.704
Messes in my chambers.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.239
These are
housekeeping matters,

17:55.241 --> 17:58.309
Which, I believe,
is your domain...

17:58.311 --> 18:00.378
Wife.

18:02.314 --> 18:05.283
Your servants say
you're not sleeping.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.553
They say your water
has run black.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.388
I'd like you to
see nostradamus.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.690
(laughs)

18:12.692 --> 18:14.792
Your wizard prophet.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.427
He has medicine.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.129
I don't trust him.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.631
Though I have been getting
some headaches.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.767
I'll have a doctor brought in
from the village.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.535
Hmm?
Henry, if
you're ill...

18:24.537 --> 18:27.271
Kings, rulers,
monarchs, do not get ill,

18:27.273 --> 18:30.141
Because the stability
of the realm depends on them.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.543
If the people thought
their king couldn't lead,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.545
The country would descend
into madness.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.647
Yes, I am aware of that.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.683
Good. Then my headache

18:38.685 --> 18:40.685
Will be our little secret,

18:40.687 --> 18:42.620
Won't it?

18:44.823 --> 18:46.290
(thudding)

18:46.292 --> 18:48.593
(henry sighs)

18:59.838 --> 19:01.806
You're awake.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.641
Are you hungry?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.743
Your skill with
medicine, healing...

19:05.745 --> 19:08.546
It's like some kind of magic.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.815
No, not magic.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.783
Science, perhaps.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.318
If I'm doing it right.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.786
I like watching you putter.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.756
The care you take--
measuring, mixing.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.761
(sighs)

19:26.565 --> 19:28.799
These are for me, aren't they?

19:28.801 --> 19:30.868
So I can dress up as
if everything's normal,

19:30.870 --> 19:32.770
And go and present myself
upstairs?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.639
You need to rejoin
the living.
Why?

19:34.641 --> 19:37.208
Why can't I stay
here in secret?

19:37.210 --> 19:38.609
Hiding won't help you.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.578
You don't understand
what's inside me.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.613
Something happened to you,

19:42.615 --> 19:43.814
Something horrible,

19:43.816 --> 19:45.650
And you feel
weakened and afraid,

19:45.652 --> 19:47.385
But you will not
be judged for it.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.354
I judge my actions,
and they were wrong.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.924
I came here
to betray people.

19:52.926 --> 19:56.594
I abandoned them when
they needed me most.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.696
I was ready for it
when it chose me.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.264
It was no coincidence.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.967
You said men took you.
Yes, but it wanted me.

20:02.969 --> 20:08.239
It let me live because it knew
that I was dirty already.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.509
And then it filled me...
With evil.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.745
It's all through me.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.281
It's in my blood,

20:17.283 --> 20:20.451
And I will never be the same.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.253
(knocking)

20:22.255 --> 20:24.622
(door opening)

20:27.993 --> 20:29.627
I see you've accepted

20:29.629 --> 20:31.495
Count nardeen's
offer of courtship.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.831
He seems a fine prospect
for marriage.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.833
Are you sure
that's a wise choice?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.935
Why do you ask?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.904
Because you're my friend,
and I care about you.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.707
Lola, you can't spend the kind
of night we spent together

20:42.709 --> 20:44.242
And not feel
something for someone.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.576
For you.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.777
I want you
to be happy.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.012
To spend your energies
on someone

20:48.014 --> 20:49.580
That you could have
a future with.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.948
You want to be married,
don't you,

20:50.950 --> 20:53.317
With a family
and a home?
Yes, very much.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.686
Then you might be wasting
your time on philipe nardeen.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.723
Words spoken at first light

20:58.725 --> 21:00.391
Amongst wine and merriment
are not always

21:00.393 --> 21:01.592
To be taken
seriously.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.427
But he seemed very serious.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.496
His marriage is, in fact,

21:05.498 --> 21:06.831
A condition of
his inheritance.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.566
Is that any reason
for you to marry him?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.635
Is it any reason not to?

21:12.504 --> 21:14.839
Do you have some issue with him?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.374
No.
Some...

21:16.376 --> 21:18.643
Previous history?

21:18.645 --> 21:19.977
No.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.581
It's not as if we're engaged.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.449
I plan on getting
to know him.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.451
You're sure.
Yes.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.986
I'm in no rush.

21:28.988 --> 21:32.456
But... Don't you think
it's better,

21:32.458 --> 21:35.459
Given our history, that the
matter of me searching for...

21:35.461 --> 21:39.463
A mate, for love, is settled?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.332
Sooner rather than later?

21:41.334 --> 21:44.001
Yes. Yes, I suppose it is.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.003
But promise me
that you're not doing this

21:46.005 --> 21:47.405
Because of what happened

21:47.407 --> 21:48.739
Between us in paris.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.875
I promise you.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.511
I'm doing it for me.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.515
(hammering)

22:00.018 --> 22:02.820
(exhales)
the concept is simple.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.755
You make every entry
impassable

22:04.757 --> 22:08.092
Except for one, and that one
is so narrow and well-defended

22:08.094 --> 22:10.761
That anyone trying
to enter is easily...

22:10.763 --> 22:12.630
Battled.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.365
In this case,
it's your front door.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.767
We know what a murder hole is,
but it won't work.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.035
I haven't shown you
how I'm going

22:18.037 --> 22:19.503
To greet them
inside the house yet.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.372
Doesn't matter.
It can't be stopped.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.941
I'm telling you, we're not
dealing with a monster.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.677
We're dealing with a small group
of ignorant pagans. If you don't

22:26.679 --> 22:28.646
Want to fight it,
why don't you leave?
And go where?

22:28.648 --> 22:31.515
To a village, where we'll be
burned for our pagan beliefs?

22:31.517 --> 22:35.086
We live here. We couldn't
leave now if we wanted to.

22:35.088 --> 22:38.055
Besides, it's too late now--
we're chosen.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.957
Because what would
we be doing?

22:39.959 --> 22:43.694
Leaving the darkness to
choose from another home?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.830
We live among other
families here,

22:45.832 --> 22:48.132
Even if you
don't see them.

22:48.134 --> 22:51.001
And this darkness,
have you seen it?

22:51.003 --> 22:53.871
Has anyone?
Whoever dares look
on it is taken.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.940
And those who
are taken die.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.075
How convenient.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.944
So no one can say

22:59.946 --> 23:03.581
What it looks like
or if it's even really there.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.718
Rowan, carrick,
I need you inside.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.456
If we move heavy furniture
in front of the door,

23:12.458 --> 23:13.858
They'll have to come in
single file.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.893
That'll make them, or it,
easier targets.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.028
Can either of you
throw a blade?

23:19.498 --> 23:22.099
What a different world
you must live in.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.435
So many romantic
and glorious battles.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.106
Castle folk like to believe
all their money and armies

23:29.108 --> 23:30.908
Can conquer any foe.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.644
Otherwise, why fight so hard
over nonsense

23:33.646 --> 23:35.179
Like titles and marriages?

23:36.648 --> 23:38.182
People like us have
to fight life's

23:38.184 --> 23:39.917
True enemies:

23:39.919 --> 23:43.454
Starvation, cold...

23:43.456 --> 23:46.724
And the things that come hunting
for men in the night.

23:46.726 --> 23:50.194
You can't fight things
that aren't...

23:50.196 --> 23:51.796
Aren't real.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.798
You won't be fighting
this night at all.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.099
We can't risk it.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.168
The tea.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.502
I'm sorry.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.746
I know.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.648
I come here too often
and it's a risk,

24:10.650 --> 24:12.016
But something extraordinary
has happened.
What is it?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.184
Lord peppercorn... Castleroy...

24:13.186 --> 24:14.618
Lord castleroy has offered me

24:14.620 --> 24:15.786
An apprenticeship at one

24:15.788 --> 24:17.455
Of his spice
houses in Spain.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.023
As a reward for saving his life.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.659
Leith, leith, sit down
and take a breath.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.197
This is unbelievable.
It's your chance to rise.

24:26.199 --> 24:28.132
You'd be a member
of the merchant class.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.000
Oh, my family,

24:30.002 --> 24:32.002
They've been nothing
but servants for generations.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.170
I'm the first to make it

24:33.172 --> 24:34.905
To the royal court.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.874
You'd serve no one but yourself.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.176
I don't know what to do.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.778
Of course you do.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.079
You're going
to take it.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.681
The position is in Spain.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.050
I might never
see you again.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.819
We can't go on this way.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.655
I need to marry a man
with title.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.791
But you haven't.
This will end.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.960
I know.

24:55.962 --> 24:59.897
But I always thought
you'd be the one to end it.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.099
You'd be sparing me that.

25:02.101 --> 25:07.004
And I could watch you go
with more... Hope than sadness.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.046
Say yes.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.549
I love you.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.291
Francis:
Yes, that should
be fine.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.693
I wanted to ask you
about lola.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.896
I think we need
to help her.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.631
But I am helping her.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.133
By suggesting philipe nardeen
as a suitor?

25:36.135 --> 25:38.536
She could do
a lot worse.

25:38.538 --> 25:42.139
In many respects...
Except one.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.875
The count prefers
the company of men.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.210
Don't you all?

25:46.212 --> 25:48.012
In bed.

25:50.115 --> 25:52.316
Oh...

25:52.318 --> 25:53.918
How do you know?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.619
One hears things.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.121
It makes
no difference to me.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.789
Most people might
never notice, but...

25:58.791 --> 26:01.058
A wife will.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.860
There's no solution at all.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.229
Solution to what?

26:05.231 --> 26:07.231
Lola just very much
wants to get married.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.333
Like all women do.
Yes, so she said.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.803
You and lola have spoken?

26:12.805 --> 26:15.139
Are you confiding
in one another now?

26:18.143 --> 26:20.244
I'm sorry. I don't know why

26:20.246 --> 26:22.580
I said that.
I think perhaps I do.

26:22.582 --> 26:26.283
I'm going to tell you something,
and I want you to promise

26:26.285 --> 26:28.953
That you won't
blame lola for it.

26:28.955 --> 26:32.356
We encountered
one another in paris.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.291
And we slept together.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.126
It was one night.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.828
I didn't think
it mattered.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.296
You were engaged
to my brother.

26:39.298 --> 26:43.100
But she is your friend
and she was wracked with guilt,

26:43.102 --> 26:45.269
Guilt that I now feel,

26:45.271 --> 26:47.738
Because, as events
would have it, you are,

26:47.740 --> 26:49.607
Thankfully,

26:49.609 --> 26:53.911
Mercifully and blessedly,
my wife.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.747
Mary, I am so sorry.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.616
It's all right.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.017
Circumstances

27:00.019 --> 27:01.652
Were... Different.

27:01.654 --> 27:04.121
I understand.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.657
Just like that.

27:06.659 --> 27:09.326
You understand?

27:09.328 --> 27:11.929
You don't even seem surprised.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.098
Did lola tell you?

27:14.100 --> 27:16.667
I saw you two arrive together
at the castle.

27:16.669 --> 27:17.935
We had been apart...

27:17.937 --> 27:19.403
But we are
together now.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.139
Utterly. Completely.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.074
I am yours.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.111
There is nothing
between lola and I.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.179
Nothing.

27:31.683 --> 27:33.684
I just lied to my husband.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.185
For you.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.856
He confessed to your night
in paris.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.224
Oh, no.
And I had
to pretend--

27:40.226 --> 27:42.726
Not very convincingly, I add--

27:42.728 --> 27:44.128
That I was shocked.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.163
And I'm going to have
to go on pretending,

27:46.165 --> 27:48.232
Until you move on

27:48.234 --> 27:50.901
Or until we forget
about you.
You don't mean that.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.703
Isn't that both
what we want, though?

27:52.705 --> 27:56.340
For you to get married
and move far away?

27:58.143 --> 28:01.845
Lola, wouldn't it be best if we
just told francis the truth?

28:01.847 --> 28:04.048
No. For me, it would not.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.416
Then you could stay in my life,

28:05.418 --> 28:06.750
We could find
our friendship again.

28:06.752 --> 28:09.019
And what are we now? Enemies?

28:09.021 --> 28:10.354
I am a liar!

28:10.356 --> 28:12.289
To my husband.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.092
And if the truth comes out
and he loses faith in me for it,

28:15.094 --> 28:16.293
I will resent you.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.430
It won't come out. Ever.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.166
I will take this
secret to my grave.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.834
You have to marry

28:23.836 --> 28:26.403
Philipe nardeen.
It's the only solution.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.372
You both have secrets to hide.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.474
What secrets does he have?

28:31.976 --> 28:34.945
Francis told me
that the count prefers men...

28:34.947 --> 28:36.814
In his bed.

28:36.816 --> 28:39.349
He prefers men?

28:39.351 --> 28:41.251
Ah.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.987
So that's what he meant
by "amusing companions."

28:43.989 --> 28:45.756
It's all for
his inheritance.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.092
He'd never be a true husband.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.393
Well, does that matter,

28:49.395 --> 28:50.894
As long as it solves
your problems?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.329
Keeps you from being shamed?

28:52.331 --> 28:54.364
I'd be living a lie forever
with no chance

28:54.366 --> 28:57.034
Of happiness.
Well, maybe you've had
your chance.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.970
What does that mean?
It means
that you made a mistake,

28:59.972 --> 29:02.906
And now you have to fix it
before it destroys

29:02.908 --> 29:05.876
My marriage.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.011
If philipe nardeen asks you
to marry him,

29:08.013 --> 29:09.813
You will accept.

29:09.815 --> 29:12.883
Or I will tell francis
the truth myself.

29:20.225 --> 29:22.960
Francis.

29:24.829 --> 29:27.097
They're beautiful.
What was I thinking

29:27.099 --> 29:30.467
Not giving my new bride
a first light candle?

29:30.469 --> 29:33.203
Well, we've been married
for some months now.

29:33.205 --> 29:36.807
There have been too many regrets

29:36.809 --> 29:39.176
In too short
a time.

29:39.178 --> 29:40.511
I know that you regret

29:40.513 --> 29:41.945
What happened.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.414
Lola does, too.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.955
♪ running through the heat

29:51.957 --> 29:53.357

30:15.848 --> 30:17.514
If there's any point
to that tonight.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.283
What do you mean?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.852
One thing I've learned

30:21.854 --> 30:25.389
From your mother's
many lectures

30:25.391 --> 30:27.157
And insights
on pregnancy

30:27.159 --> 30:29.159
Is that there are some days

30:29.161 --> 30:30.894
When it's more likely

30:30.896 --> 30:33.597
And days when it is
less likely.
(chuckles)

30:34.899 --> 30:37.568
You've been, uh...

30:37.570 --> 30:42.573
Vigorous in trying to achieve
what we both want, but...

30:42.575 --> 30:45.008
I don't think it's going
to happen tonight.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.010
Vigorous.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.146
Oh, I like that.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.447
(chuckles)

30:50.449 --> 30:52.349
I thought you
did, too.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.320
I don't make love to you
because I want a baby.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.422
I want a baby

30:58.424 --> 31:00.490
Because I love you.

31:21.380 --> 31:25.449

31:37.396 --> 31:39.963
Lady greer. What a...
What a pleasant surprise.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.531
I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.200
No, no. Quite
the contrary.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.935
I was... I was actually
thinking about you.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.604
The reality of your company's
even better.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.941
I wanted to thank you
for offering leith

31:50.943 --> 31:52.209
That apprenticeship.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.577
It was the least I could do.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.045
Especially
when you asked me so kindly.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.980
He can't know it was my idea.

31:56.982 --> 31:59.383
No, of course.

32:02.620 --> 32:05.589
I know I'm easy to make fun of.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.557
People do.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.626
I grow very excited about
things that matter to me.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.162
Like peppers.
And kindness.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.431
Beauty, warmth.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.333
I believe you have some
warmth in your heart

32:16.335 --> 32:17.968
For the servant leith.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.337
Oh, I see that even calling
him a servant pains you,

32:20.339 --> 32:21.972
But a-a servant he is.

32:21.974 --> 32:24.074
I'm well aware
of that.
I know you are, but...

32:24.076 --> 32:25.609
In my own way, I-I can
be quite perceptive,

32:25.611 --> 32:26.977
As I suggested earlier.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.478
Please, don't.
My dear girl,

32:28.480 --> 32:30.981
I see nothing wrong
with a harmless flirtation.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.382
And I admire
your kindness

32:32.384 --> 32:34.518
In giving someone you
know who is suffering,

32:34.520 --> 32:37.621
Even a kitchen boy,
a soft landing.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.357
Because you know a woman
of your status needs a man

32:40.359 --> 32:41.658
Who can provide for her

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
In the manner
that you deserve.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.529
It sounds so cold.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.731
But it needn't be.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.600
It needn't be.

32:52.537 --> 32:55.605
You've been generous to me,
and to leith, as well,

32:55.607 --> 32:59.343
But I've accepted
all the kindness I can from you.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.412
Thank you, lord castleroy.

33:11.422 --> 33:15.592
(goat bleating)

33:15.594 --> 33:18.095
(goat bleating,
wind whistling)

33:23.167 --> 33:25.335
(grunts)

33:25.337 --> 33:27.704
(goat bleating)

33:27.706 --> 33:30.173
(high-pitched tone)

33:30.175 --> 33:32.042
It's coming.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.778
(door creaks open,
wind whistling)

33:38.316 --> 33:41.385
(goat bleating)

33:43.454 --> 33:45.622
(heavy sigh, goat bleating)

33:45.624 --> 33:49.526
(heavy footsteps)

33:49.528 --> 33:52.195
What are you?

33:52.197 --> 33:55.132
(goat bleating)

33:57.335 --> 33:59.770
(cries)
close your eyes.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.705
Close your eyes.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.312
(grunts softly)

34:09.314 --> 34:11.481
(loud breathing)

34:12.583 --> 34:14.818
(pained groaning)

34:14.820 --> 34:17.120
Rowan, don't look.

34:17.122 --> 34:18.688
No.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.091
(screaming)

34:21.093 --> 34:23.427
(screaming continues)

34:23.429 --> 34:25.295
(panting)

34:25.297 --> 34:27.631
(screaming)

34:36.841 --> 34:39.676
(water flowing)

34:52.557 --> 34:55.826
(sighs)

34:55.828 --> 34:58.328
You are brand-new.

34:58.330 --> 35:02.399
None of what you were need
remain, except what you choose.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.701
Evil is not a thing.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.237
It is not a condition.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.272
It is a choice.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.676
You are only
what you choose.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.645
That alone is
what makes you.

35:18.716 --> 35:22.185
Do you know
what you choose?

35:23.287 --> 35:25.789
Then hold onto
that choice,

35:25.791 --> 35:28.792
Because it's
your salvation.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.730
Do you believe it now?

35:33.732 --> 35:36.199
Are you new?

35:36.201 --> 35:38.401
Yes.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.770
With you.

35:46.444 --> 35:47.844
We've been looking all night.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.346
We won't find her.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.847
We won't find her alive, anyway.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.150
This is my fault.

35:53.152 --> 35:56.820
I cried out, she turned to look
at me, she saw the face of...

35:56.822 --> 35:58.822
I was so sure it was a man.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.690
Now I don't know
what it is.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.325
It's the darkness.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.494
Whatever it is,
I won't rest until it's dead.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.829
You can't fight it.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.497
Maybe not alone,

36:07.499 --> 36:11.401
But I know where
I can go for help.

36:15.373 --> 36:18.175
I was reminded of what
being married could be like,

36:18.177 --> 36:21.444
And I realized I
owe you an apology.

36:21.446 --> 36:24.648
I was unfeeling to you
earlier because I was afraid.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.816
Of what?

36:26.818 --> 36:29.252
Of what might happen
if francis finds out.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.854
He won't.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.757
What if he does and you bare
his child, his only child?

36:33.759 --> 36:35.692
Mary, you will
get pregnant.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.195
Hasn't been that long.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.830
We were together
before we were wed.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.399
It's been months,
in truth.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.367
And you were with
francis only one night.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.902
Unless you're lying
to me about that.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.404
I'm not.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.738
Lola, tell
me the truth.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.640
Has this been going
on for some time?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.375
No, I swear,
it was one night.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.644
And yet, he got
you pregnant.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.347
You are going to
have his child.

36:57.349 --> 37:01.585
You say that francis will never
know, but what if he does know?

37:01.587 --> 37:03.753
Then you two might
become closer?

37:03.755 --> 37:06.656
I suppose we would,
but that's not what I want.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.326
I'm sure it's not what diane
de poitiers wanted, either,

37:09.328 --> 37:11.461
But she's been in king
henry's life for decades.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.797
A great deal of their bond
is their son, sebastian.

37:13.799 --> 37:17.767
I am not diane,
and you are not catherine.

37:17.769 --> 37:22.372
And francis is
in no way his father.

37:22.374 --> 37:25.475
More importantly,
I don't want your husband.

37:25.477 --> 37:29.546
I wouldn't risk any of this--
your anger or francis's--

37:29.548 --> 37:32.549
If I didn't want
a love of my own.

37:32.551 --> 37:35.952
Mary, please believe
that I am your friend.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.289
That I want you to be happy
and that you will be

37:39.291 --> 37:41.558
With children
of your own with francis.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.827
I want to believe that.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.595
Then do.

37:46.897 --> 37:50.033
I want you to have
every chance, as well.

37:51.502 --> 37:53.503
Don't marry philipe nardeen.

37:53.505 --> 37:57.574
Wait... Until at least the
possibility of love comes along.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.576
Are you sure?

37:59.578 --> 38:04.281
Because... Waiting--
it... It's a risk.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.616
I'm sure.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.386
And I will continue to
help you find a suitor.

38:09.388 --> 38:12.856
But in the end, it is you
who must save yourself.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.859
You mustn't let anyone
stand in your way.

38:17.728 --> 38:20.330
(bell tolling,
horse neighs, hoofbeats)

38:22.033 --> 38:23.633
Are you all right?

38:23.635 --> 38:27.070
I just needed a moment
alone with my thoughts.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.538
Me, too.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.407
Can we be alone together?

38:33.077 --> 38:35.612
You look as if you're waiting
for something.

38:35.614 --> 38:38.348
I am.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.483
My destiny is approaching
sooner than I'd like.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.918
Mine, too.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.520
(horse neighs)

38:43.522 --> 38:45.622
In fact, here
it comes now.

38:45.624 --> 38:46.923
(horse neighs)

38:46.925 --> 38:48.758
That's your destiny?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.827
And you knew it was coming?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.629
Right on time.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.932
Two days ago, I received
a letter from my parents.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.368
They've arranged a match.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.836
I'm all but engaged.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.638
My future husband arrives
in that carriage.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.640
(horse neighs)

39:05.409 --> 39:07.944
And when do you
meet your destiny?

39:07.946 --> 39:09.679
Soon, I hope.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.082
(hoofbeats)

39:13.784 --> 39:15.685
Henry:
Kenna?

39:15.687 --> 39:18.021
Henry.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.591
King henry...
Or your majesty.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.393
Have you had your breakfast?

39:23.395 --> 39:24.928
Yes, your majesty.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.963
Good. We'll both
need our energy,

39:26.965 --> 39:31.134
Because... I see a lust
in your eyes that will

39:31.136 --> 39:32.802
Not be easily extinguished.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.504
Catherine:
Henry!

39:35.639 --> 39:38.641
(sighs)

39:38.643 --> 39:41.010
Go.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.648
You're up early.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.950
Keeping an eye on you

39:46.952 --> 39:48.451
Requires vigilance
both day and night.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.086
Is that your role now?

39:50.088 --> 39:51.688
Guardian of the king?

39:51.690 --> 39:53.089
How are you feeling today?

39:53.091 --> 39:54.958
Quite well.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.726
I saw the physician.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.728
He gave me some tonics
for my headaches,

39:58.730 --> 40:00.597
And now I feel better,

40:00.599 --> 40:03.633
Having further isolated
the cause of my discontent.

40:03.635 --> 40:07.537
And what... Is that?

40:07.539 --> 40:11.741
I am king, and yet, for
months, I have been subject.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.544
To fate, to lesser people,
to women, of all things.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.913
Waiting on the queen
of England's death.

40:16.915 --> 40:20.083
Lied to... By you,
by my mistress.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.786
Put in a corner as mary,
queen of scots, dangled herself

40:22.788 --> 40:25.922
In front of my sons and
dangled England in front of me.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.725
But... No more.

40:28.727 --> 40:33.496
I dozed, as you suggested, and
do you know what I awoke to?

40:33.498 --> 40:35.098
No.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.568
Christ hanging
on the cross.

40:38.570 --> 40:42.772
A crucifix above my bed, the
sun glinting off my crown.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.075
It was... Dazzling.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.578
Invigorating.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.713
A glorious reminder
that I am chosen by god

40:50.715 --> 40:52.148
To rule this nation.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.050
To bend anyone
I like to my will.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.785
To bend them,

40:55.787 --> 40:57.487
To break them.

40:57.489 --> 40:59.522
To throw them from windows
and crush their throats?

40:59.524 --> 41:00.957
It was a lesson I think

41:00.959 --> 41:03.927
Each woman understood
in her last moment

41:03.929 --> 41:08.832
About who is king...
And who is not.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.203
Others will learn,
as well... Soon enough.
