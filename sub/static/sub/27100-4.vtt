00:01.000 --> 00:03.200
Heath Buckland? Zara Bello.
Your... tutor.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.519
In my vision,
the nematode got bigger.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.119
Then we've got a problem.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.439
What if we stop them
with a binding spell

00:12.440 --> 00:14.519
and then use a banish spell
to send them out of the world?

00:14.520 --> 00:16.158
Ellen!

00:16.160 --> 00:18.280
Grab her!
Don't let her go!

00:20.360 --> 00:23.999
Once we find her, we use elemental
communication - water to water.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.719
The element-to-element spell
is in Felix's Book of Shadows,

00:26.720 --> 00:29.039
- which is in the Lair.
- Which Bates has locked down.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.359
Felix Ferne. This is his.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.719
Open a portal.
What? And get attacked again?

00:34.720 --> 00:36.919
What do you think
we've been training for?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.919
OK, Ellen, take my hand!

00:38.920 --> 00:40.960
Ellen, jump now!

00:42.760 --> 00:44.879
You alright?
Oh, yeah...

00:44.880 --> 00:46.439
Ellen!
Ellen!

00:46.440 --> 00:47.600
Ellen!

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:43.480 --> 01:45.399
Excuse me, Nurse?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.120
We need to see Ellen O'Donnell.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.079
I see. Because I'm a woman,
I must be a nurse?

01:51.080 --> 01:52.479
Couldn't be a doctor?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.079
Well, are you a doctor?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.919
No.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.639
Are you family?
What?

01:57.640 --> 01:59.919
Visitation is generally family only.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.279
Oh, yeah, not a problem.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.919
Ellen is our aunt.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.240
On which side?

02:06.480 --> 02:07.600
The left?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.320
Please, we need to see Aunty Ellen.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.159
Your Aunty Ellen is very unwell.
She needs rest.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.999
It's not like
we're taking her out clubbing.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.959
We just want to make sure
that she's OK.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.760
Please.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.240
I can't let you in.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.159
But I'm going on my break,

02:32.160 --> 02:34.639
so you two had better not
head down that corridor,

02:34.640 --> 02:36.720
turn right and go into room 10.

02:41.160 --> 02:46.280
Negative space was so much worse
than I thought.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.200
Everything was... wrong.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.279
There was this thing.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.680
Like it came from the darkness.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.840
Or was part of it.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.400
I could feel...

03:13.400 --> 03:15.160
It was evil.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.120
Ellen, do you remember
anything else?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.080
Maybe we shouldn't be pushing her.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.440
Magic is tearing
the multiverse apart.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.439
Knock-knock.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.399
Oh, you two.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.839
You just keep turning up
in unusual places, don't you?

03:37.840 --> 03:40.279
We're just making sure
Ms O'Donnell is OK.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.319
And in the drain?
What exactly were you doing there?

03:42.320 --> 03:44.239
Our environmental project.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.639
So much stormwater's wasted.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.719
Anyway, we'd better get going.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.559
School. Learning.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.039
Yes.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.959
School.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.199
I'll see you both there.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.720
Get well soon, Ellen.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.479
Ellen, how are you?
What was going on out there?

04:05.480 --> 04:07.559
I'm not feeling the best.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.079
No, no.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.839
Just, um, this book.
I need to talk to you about it.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.360
Um, you knew Felix Ferne,
didn't you?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.560
Why is my name in here?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.999
Whatever it was, it scared
the living snot out of her.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.479
Did she say what it looked like?

04:22.480 --> 04:24.279
Size, prehensile limbs,
ocular configuration?

04:24.280 --> 04:26.439
No, just that it was evil.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.679
Really? An evil creature
lurking in negative space?

04:29.680 --> 04:30.999
Well, it gets worse.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.759
Magic is... is messing with
the universe or something.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.519
Heath?
Yes, Ms Jarra?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.079
Can I see you in my office?

04:37.080 --> 04:39.160
Can you? Probably, if I was there.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.479
Now, Heath.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.920
Yes, Miss.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.639
Bremin High is a place
you can feel supported. Nurtured.

04:47.640 --> 04:51.279
We're modifying our classes
to foster the way YOU see the world.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.399
Mm.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.719
I'm not really sure I'm understanding
anything we're saying right now.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.119
What we're saying...
what I'm saying,

04:58.120 --> 05:01.159
is on behalf of
the Education Department...

05:01.160 --> 05:04.679
..is that we've let you down by not
picking up your dyslexia sooner.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.439
It's fine, Miss.
No need to cry yourself to sleep.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.159
You've done so well
within the exclusionary parameters

05:12.160 --> 05:14.039
we've unfairly forced on you.

05:14.040 --> 05:18.599
But... it's time
to have the discussion.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.599
Your learning status doesn't have

05:20.600 --> 05:22.839
anything to do with
your intelligence.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.760
Would it be better if...

05:26.800 --> 05:28.439
..you repeated Year 10?

05:28.440 --> 05:29.800
No.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.359
No, no, no, I've... I've... I've been
working with Zara...

05:33.360 --> 05:35.319
Heath.
I've been trying.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.239
How is holding me back better?

05:37.240 --> 05:40.639
You'd have the time and the support
to catch up - to excel, even.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.679
Yeah, and a big neon sign
over my head that says, "Failure".

05:44.680 --> 05:47.879
You haven't failed, Heath.
It's the system that's failed.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.239
The school.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.679
Yeah, well, if it's the school,
why punish me?

05:51.680 --> 05:54.279
Oh, look, it's just one option
on the table

05:54.280 --> 05:55.599
in a continuing discussion.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.719
Fine.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.680
If it's a discussion, can I say no?

06:02.480 --> 06:04.840
A decision will have to be reached.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.560
It'll be easier to make
the transition earlier in the year.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.359
Can I go to class now?

06:13.360 --> 06:14.880
Of course.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.479
Heath?

06:18.480 --> 06:20.839
Yep, I can even spell
that one out for you, sir.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.879
Let's drop the aggro, thanks.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.280
Why don't you get reacquainted
with the inside of my office.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.599
Well, what is this?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.319
I'm just going to ask you
a few questions

06:30.320 --> 06:31.999
and you're going to give me
some straight answers.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.359
Yeah? What's the category.
I'm pretty good with film trivia.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.919
What happened to Ms O'Donnell?

06:36.920 --> 06:38.919
I'm not a doctor.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.239
But maybe if there was some way
to cater to my learning status...

06:42.240 --> 06:43.799
What do you know about
the hidden room?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.960
Nothing.
Hmm.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.159
What does all this
have to do with the Bremin Four?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.999
The musical? Loved it.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.599
Five-star performances all around.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.679
That key change
in the final number, solid gold.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.879
What do you know about magic?

06:57.880 --> 06:59.719
'Rabbit in the hat' magic

06:59.720 --> 07:01.679
or the kind of magic that exists

07:01.680 --> 07:03.919
between a man
and his meat lover's pizza, sir?

07:03.920 --> 07:05.480
I know you know things.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.319
And I know that you know
that I know things.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.160
And I know that you know...

07:17.400 --> 07:19.959
If you won't talk,
someone else will.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.599
Niccolina
Pandelis, please come to the office.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.120
Niccolina Pandelis.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.399
Can I help you?

07:35.400 --> 07:38.279
I emailed Bryan.
We have an appointment.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.400
Bryan? Bryan...

07:41.400 --> 07:42.599
Oh, Mr Bates.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.159
I'm Zeb.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.359
Zeb.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.199
Uh... sorry, uh,
can you just take a seat?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.199
And I'll go and... I'll go and, um...

07:50.200 --> 07:51.240
Thanks.

07:54.480 --> 07:55.960
Whoa.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.680
So, what are you in for?

08:10.760 --> 08:12.439
I don't even know, half the time.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.559
What about the other half?
What?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.080
I'm just messing with you.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.680
Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.279
Hello! Uh, Zeb.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.679
Ze-bah.
Am I saying that correctly?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.319
Only one way to say it.
Good.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.559
Rock and roll.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.199
Um, Principal Bryan Bates.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.679
Bryan, great to meet you.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.039
Hello. We already did that.
Through here.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.279
I was very intrigued
to receive your email.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.799
It was, uh, very mysterious.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.799
Hey.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.639
Hey.
What's going on?

08:43.640 --> 08:47.159
Well, Bates is all...
..about what happened to Ellen.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.919
Ms Jarra thinks
I'm Lord of the Idiots.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.199
She did get that right.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.559
And this weirdly cool guy
just showed up.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.799
Where?
In Bates's office.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.799
Listen, he's gonna go
all 'bad cop, bad cop' on you.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.359
The book's right there
in his office.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.839
If we can just get it...

09:01.840 --> 09:04.559
So, I'll show you the structure.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.079
It's incredible
how well it was concealed.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.000
Oh, but first we'll need, uh...

09:10.840 --> 09:13.039
He is weirdly cool.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.560
We'll need these.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.160
They're going to the Lair.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.439
I'm on it.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.360
LED, I think.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.439
Spells, prophecies,
mystical artefacts.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.919
So much to discover.
Fascinating.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.920
Yeah, it's obviously
been here for years.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.679
Do you mind my asking,
uh, how you heard about it?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.839
It was all over social media.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.759
A secret room
discovered in a school,

09:41.760 --> 09:43.559
in a town already shrouded
in mystery.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.319
You said your background
was in linguistics?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.479
Ancient languages.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.319
Have you ever seen anything
quite like this?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.079
Huh.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.519
Interesting.

09:54.520 --> 09:58.119
Obviously I have, uh,
some knowledge of linguistics,

09:58.120 --> 09:59.959
from my university days.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.119
Obviously.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.280
But this seemed a little more, um...
Arcane?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.240
Well spotted, Bryan.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.199
Thank you.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.519
I'd like to take a closer look.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.519
No.
I could take them with me.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.279
Do a more detailed study.

10:15.280 --> 10:19.479
Or... I can set you up
in one of our offices...

10:19.480 --> 10:21.399
..for the afternoon,

10:21.400 --> 10:23.040
if you have the time.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.679
I've got time.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.919
I used to play in the brass band.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.879
Classical. Flugelhorn.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.639
Very underrated instrument.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.440
Guess I'm going the long way.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.479
Hey!

10:49.480 --> 10:51.519
So, you can't answer
my texts now, huh?

10:51.520 --> 10:54.159
No. Wait, sorry, what?

10:54.160 --> 10:56.279
You can't even use the dyslexia
as an excuse

10:56.280 --> 10:58.279
because that new font keyboard
I put in your phone

10:58.280 --> 11:00.439
makes it easier to type, Heath.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.679
Sorry, I...

11:01.680 --> 11:03.559
I gotta go.
Heath!

11:03.560 --> 11:06.480
I don't...
I haven't read up on that.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.600
You need to work on your cardio.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.400
You made it.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.119
So, I'll just set you up in here.

11:23.120 --> 11:26.040
A bit more natural light.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.839
Nice little office.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.679
Brianna can get you tea or coffee
or whatever you need.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.680
Ah, yeah...

11:31.681 --> 11:33.879
And if you find anything
interesting, you'll, uh...

11:33.880 --> 11:36.039
You're the first one I'll call.
Ah, yes.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.280
Cool!

11:38.320 --> 11:39.600
Great.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.199
Now...

11:42.200 --> 11:44.400
Nicco, my office.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.439
You're not just
a good student, Nicco.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.599
You could be the first
in Bremin High history

11:49.600 --> 11:51.559
to make the state football team.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.479
Didn't Patrick Birmingham
make the state team in 1986?

11:54.480 --> 11:57.319
He was originally from Rochford,
so that doesn't count.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.039
Student safety is paramount to me.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.039
That hidden room.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.159
Imagine if one of you
were to get hurt.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.680
Or worse.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.239
If it was discovered
that you had any knowledge,

12:14.240 --> 12:15.800
that you were involved...
I am involved.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.439
Um, being involved is what I do.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.079
I'm on the football team,
debating team, science club...

12:23.080 --> 12:25.240
Yes. Yes.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.599
And your entire future
could be jeopardised

12:28.600 --> 12:30.079
by falling in with the wrong crowd.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.199
Sorry, what crowd is that, sir?
Well, you tell me.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.639
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

12:33.640 --> 12:36.639
I mean, magic.
As in pixies and fairy dust?

12:36.640 --> 12:38.519
As in witches.
You think I'm a witch?

12:38.520 --> 12:40.040
Are you?

12:42.600 --> 12:44.639
Sorry for
the interruption, teachers,

12:44.640 --> 12:48.519
but would Luke Hamil and Jesse Banda
and Ben Ripley

12:48.520 --> 12:50.639
please come to the office.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.839
Thank you.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.440
♪ Have a nice day... ♪

12:57.680 --> 12:59.720
Gosh, what was that?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.759
No! No, get away from me!

13:19.760 --> 13:21.599
Help me!

13:21.600 --> 13:23.599
Something's coming after me!

13:23.600 --> 13:25.960
No! Help me!

13:27.920 --> 13:29.960
No!

13:32.120 --> 13:34.159
No. No, no, no, no.
Ellen, stop.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.719
No, no.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.959
No, I need to get out of here!
I need... I need to go. I need...

13:38.960 --> 13:41.119
You can't leave. You've got a fever.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.719
Your blood tests
are showing abnormalities

13:42.720 --> 13:44.279
that we cannot explain...
Where's my stuff?!

13:44.280 --> 13:47.240
Where's my clothes?
You need to get back into bed.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.440
And you... need to get out of my way.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.839
Well... Did you get the book?

14:14.840 --> 14:17.439
Yes, I asked him for it
and he gave it right to me.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.799
What'd Bates say?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.119
He called me a witch.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.639
Well, if the pointy hat fits.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.519
We really need to speak to Ellen.
Yeah.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.959
Evil negative space monster -

14:24.960 --> 14:26.639
it definitely requires
more information.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.480
Yeah, and there's this guy.

14:29.480 --> 14:33.519
He's really cool.
Yeah, and really suss.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.359
He's reading books from the Lair.
Reading books by choice?

14:36.360 --> 14:37.600
Totally suss.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.519
Right.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.000
Who's next?

14:43.040 --> 14:46.599
Luke.
It's lunchtime, sir. We're starving.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.159
Yeah, you can't
keep us here forever.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.239
Can I not?

14:49.240 --> 14:51.959
Well, we... do need to eat.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.559
Yeah. Yeah, it's one of those human
rights we learnt about, sir.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.240
Yeah, food, shelter and cruffins.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.959
It's a croissant
crossed with a muffin.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.680
Yes, alright. Back here on the bell.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.279
So, what's the plan now?

15:09.280 --> 15:10.559
Me and Ben will go to the hospital.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.320
See if Ellen can tell us anything
more about negative space.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.320
Ugh!

15:17.840 --> 15:19.839
Come on, really?

15:19.840 --> 15:21.519
Peta, wait up.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.199
I want to keep an eye on Zeb.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.039
Ah, that must sting.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.519
Your boyfriend's got his eye
on someone else.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.079
Remind me to slow clap you later.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.479
Leave it.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.279
Where are you off to?

15:32.280 --> 15:34.719
Back into the closet?

15:34.720 --> 15:36.680
Shut up, Ali.
I get it.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.920
No-one talks smack about your lady.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.240
You're the troll?

15:46.480 --> 15:47.880
Just a bit of fun.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.240
Nice one, Buckland.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.399
Always knew you were soft.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.960
Yeah, nice one, Buckland.
What?

16:03.160 --> 16:04.719
I was defending you.

16:04.720 --> 16:08.080
I told you not to.
You just made it so much worse.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.520
Jesse!

16:15.840 --> 16:17.359
Ellen!

16:17.360 --> 16:18.919
Ellen?

16:18.920 --> 16:22.160
Where is she?
Left. AMA.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.879
"Against medical advice".

16:25.880 --> 16:28.039
You could have just said that.
Do you know where she went?

16:28.040 --> 16:30.319
No, but if she's still alive
when you find her,

16:30.320 --> 16:31.880
can you tell her to get back here?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.799
Or don't.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.440
As if I care.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.039
- Ellen?
- Something's wrong.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.000
She's wearing pink.
Ellen!

16:45.120 --> 16:47.199
I was just coming for you.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.439
I saw something.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.879
We know. Heath told us.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.520
No. There's more.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.040
Ben, what is it?

17:25.720 --> 17:27.439
We made a mistake.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.239
We made it worse.
What? What's worse?

17:30.240 --> 17:34.919
When we sent those parasites there,
there was something there already.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.959
Like an entity.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.479
They've merged.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.359
It's getting stronger.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.999
You can't risk letting it in.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.479
But if this is our fault,
we need to fix it.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.359
And Ben's spirit power
just kicked in.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.039
We'll high five later.
Yeah, no...

17:48.040 --> 17:51.079
If you want to fix it, no spells.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.359
No elemental powers.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.999
She's right. It fits with what I saw.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.640
Give me the talisman.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.279
Why?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.840
You can't use magic.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.719
It might be safer.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.399
I don't know. I think
I'll talk about it with the others.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.759
Luke, but...

18:08.760 --> 18:10.600
We'll get you home, OK?

18:11.960 --> 18:14.239
No... No magic.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.080
You need to tell the others.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.919
I was trying to help.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.319
Yeah?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.080
How'd that work out?

18:37.040 --> 18:38.600
Idiots.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.640
Uh... Um...

18:44.000 --> 18:45.840
Um...

18:55.760 --> 18:58.279
You first. Jesse.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.560
Number one. Sounds accurate.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.039
If you need a bathroom break...

19:10.040 --> 19:12.239
No, I... I just have a problem
with lying.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.479
Since when? You used to be a champ.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.799
I find it stressful -
I know I'm gonna go in there,

19:17.800 --> 19:19.479
he's gonna sit me down,
he's gonna ask me questions

19:19.480 --> 19:21.759
and I'm eventually gonna tell
the truth and then we're all doomed.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.559
You want to know the trick
with lying, Ben?

19:24.560 --> 19:25.920
Uh-huh.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.239
Don't do it.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.599
But...
There are many truths.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.000
Be honest.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.600
Choose a different truth.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.800
I guess.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.239
I read the book.
I'm only part way through.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.679
Don't spoil the ending.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.799
You've never been in the principal's
office before, have you, Ben?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.359
Yes, I have.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.599
I had to eat my lunch in here all of
Year 7, or Ali would steal it.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.559
I'm glad you've found some friends,
Ben, but I have to ask...

19:57.560 --> 19:59.599
..have you found the right friends?

19:59.600 --> 20:02.559
Should... should I turn around, sir,
when you're behind me?

20:02.560 --> 20:05.559
I mean, maybe if I had your
swivel chair, we could easily...

20:05.560 --> 20:07.600
You seem nervous.
Hmm?

20:08.680 --> 20:10.079
I'm not.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.919
I think I just look like this.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.399
I think it's the glasses,
or the general facial structure.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.159
You don't have any reason
to be nervous, do you, Ben?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.439
No. No reason at all.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.119
If this was the dentist, however,
that makes me nervous.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.999
I hate the dentist.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.640
I floss before, during
and after every meal, just in case.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.479
I've never had a filling.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.959
Ben already told me everything.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.399
You might say he sang like a canary.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.079
Is that an expression
from the olden days?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.599
I know all about it.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.799
The magic, the ley lines,
the Bremin Four.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.999
Sorry, I missed that.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.039
It's funny how you can't hear
when you're yawning.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.719
Is that a science thing?

20:47.720 --> 20:49.919
I have someone looking at
the books right now.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.679
The cool guy?
Yes, the cool guy!

20:52.680 --> 20:55.119
And when he's finished
translating the text, then...

20:55.120 --> 20:56.399
Don't tell me.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.919
The two of you will order Thai
takeaway and have a quiet night in?

20:59.920 --> 21:01.519
I mean, drills are really scary.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.999
They could go right through
your cheek, if it slips.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.079
You are going to tell me
what happened!

21:06.080 --> 21:08.119
I would.
But then I'd have to kill you.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.599
Kidding, sir.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.999
Luke does the killing. I'm in charge
of white rabbits and magic wands.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.399
I've had it up to here
with all of you!

21:15.400 --> 21:18.359
Unless you tell me what I want
to know, there will be consequences.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.439
There are things I can do,
you know, if I want to!

21:20.440 --> 21:23.359
Things that could make your lives
a little less pleasant.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.679
Like, for example,
no state football team.

21:26.680 --> 21:30.239
Perhaps sending you back to Year 10.

21:30.240 --> 21:34.719
How would you like your mother
to be your home room teacher?

21:34.720 --> 21:36.439
No school musical!

21:36.440 --> 21:38.279
Sir, that's a bit...
Quiet!

21:38.280 --> 21:39.679
What, so it's the mega-demon?

21:39.680 --> 21:40.959
No.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.479
Ben said that it's like it's made
with bits of the mega-demon.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.439
So, basically, we made it worse?

21:46.440 --> 21:48.720
Well, that seems to be
the theme for today.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.999
Oh, hey, you talking about
that photo that Ali put up?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.519
There is zero Photoshop game
on that boy.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.439
What photo?

21:57.440 --> 21:59.040
What, haven't you seen it?

22:02.720 --> 22:04.879
Oh, don't worry.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.359
Everyone knows
Ali's a total knuckle-dragger.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.599
Oh, darling, that green
really brings out your eyes.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.759
Look, I hate to say I told you so...

22:12.760 --> 22:14.159
Oh, no, please do, Jesse.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.720
I'd love to hear more
about what I've done wrong.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.719
Benjamin.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.119
Benjamin.
Mm...

22:24.120 --> 22:27.279
You are facing a world of pain.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.399
Mm.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.319
I think the mistake
that your little gang has made

22:32.320 --> 22:34.279
is to underestimate me.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.880
You seem to think that I'll give up.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.800
But that's not going to happen.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.919
Someone will tell me
what I want to know.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.199
Oh...

22:45.200 --> 22:48.040
And that someone, Benjamin...
that someone is you.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.479
Oh, my shoes!

22:52.480 --> 22:54.960
Oh, that hasn't happened in a while.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.279
Ben's been in there quite a while.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.919
He's gonna crack, I know it.
He'll be fine.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.959
I gave him a little lesson in lying.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.639
Your special subject.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.040
He is so going to crack.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.760
Go on, out you get.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.600
Go and clean yourself up.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.360
This is not the end of this.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.519
It is not the end of it
by a long shot!

23:21.520 --> 23:25.759
Believe you me, I will find out
what's going on.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.200
I will.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.520
You may have won this round.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.359
Hey, uh, Heath is it?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.519
Hey.
Can you give me a hand?

23:36.520 --> 23:38.399
It'll just take a sec.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.079
Uh... sure.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.320
Cool.

23:46.520 --> 23:50.519
If it's advice about topknots
you want, not sure I'm your man.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.440
I think I've got
the haircare covered.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.839
Is that...?

23:58.840 --> 24:01.040
And you want to help me, don't you?

24:03.160 --> 24:05.319
I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.759
I don't want to help you.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.159
Sure you do.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.560
For a start,
I'll take Felix Ferne's book.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.040
No.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.600
Come on, Heath.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.480
You know you want to.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.519
What do you think the cool guy
wants with Heath?

24:26.520 --> 24:28.119
He's not that cool.
He's so cool.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.759
He's definitely cool.
He's pretty cool.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.800
Anyway...

24:43.560 --> 24:45.200
It was a pleasure to meet you all.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.119
What was that?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.400
I...

24:58.480 --> 25:00.319
Uh, I'm... I'm not sure...

25:00.320 --> 25:01.960
Where's the book?

25:06.400 --> 25:08.439
Oh, no.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.160
- He's getting away.
- Stop him!

25:18.600 --> 25:19.639
What did you do?

25:19.640 --> 25:20.999
I... look I...
What?!

25:21.000 --> 25:22.039
Oh, I stole for nothing.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.559
What, so you gave him
the Book of Shadows?

25:23.560 --> 25:25.039
Why would you do that?
Well, I didn't mean to!

25:25.040 --> 25:26.599
You basically gift-wrapped it
for him.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.319
Are you really that...?
Stupid? Useless?

25:28.320 --> 25:29.600
Yeah. Yeah, I am, Jesse.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.480
Where are you going?

25:36.320 --> 25:38.919
Bates is accusing us
of grand theft notebook.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.319
The circumstance being that
you stole the book from my office!

25:42.320 --> 25:45.079
You are facing suspension,
even expulsion.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.279
Wakey-wakey! You wagging school?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.199
Not wagging, I'm quitting.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.119
Well, then,
what are you going to do?

25:51.120 --> 25:53.640
I don't know, get a job, pay taxes.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.759
Zeb? What kind of name
is that?

25:59.760 --> 26:02.279
Heath thinks
that Zeb put a spell on him,

26:02.280 --> 26:03.879
forced him to hand over the book.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.200
Zeb knows magic?

26:06.200 --> 26:08.599
I know you're really sick,
but we need your help.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.959
What's happened?
