00:05.806 --> 00:08.109
,
( theme music playing )

00:13.447 --> 00:16.717
HELLO?
NO, I CAN'T FIND IT.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.820
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
MY ASSISTANT'S NOT HERE.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.822
I CAN'T-- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.358
I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.695
- HEY.
- LET'S GO.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.030
( sighs )
LUNCH.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.566
- LUNCH!
- I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT.

00:32.666 --> 00:36.204
WHERE'S ANTOINETTE?
DOESN'T SHE REMIND YOU
OF THESE THINGS?

00:36.304 --> 00:39.073
YEAH, EXCEPT SHE HASN'T
BEEN HERE IN THREE WEEKS.

00:39.173 --> 00:42.610
- WELL, WHERE IS SHE?
- SHE TOLD ME THAT HER FATHER
WAS DYING

00:42.710 --> 00:44.778
AND SHE WANTED TO GO HOME
AND SPEND SOME TIME WITH HIM

00:44.878 --> 00:47.415
AND HE HASN'T DIED.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.583
HE'S KIND OF,
YOU KNOW, LINGERING.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.486
- WHAT IF HE HANGS ON
FOR, LIKE, SIX MONTHS?
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM!

00:52.586 --> 00:55.989
- YOU'RE STUCK.
- I KNOW, WHAT CAN I DO?
I CAN'T FIRE HER.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.426
- RIGHT?
- YOU KNOW, IF HE KNEW

00:58.526 --> 01:01.028
THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S JOB
WAS IN JEOPARDY,

01:01.129 --> 01:03.063
BASED ON HANGING ON,
HE'D DIE.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.100
MAYBE IF SHE JUST SAID,
"DAD, I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO WORK."

01:06.200 --> 01:07.901
- YEAH.
- ( knocks )

01:08.001 --> 01:10.538
HEY, I'M DINO
FROM BIG DOG PRODUCTIONS.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.006
I'M MOVING IN NEXT DOOR.
YOU CAN CALL ME DOG.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.775
- EVERYBODY CALLS ME DOG.
- Larry: DOG!

01:14.875 --> 01:16.076
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.
- I LIKE IT.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.312
UM, ANYWAY, I'M DOING
THE SHARK SHOW.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.914
YOU'VE HEARD
OF THE SHARK SHOW, RIGHT,
"GREAT WHITE WONDERLAND"?

01:21.014 --> 01:23.617
- I'VE SEEN SOME ADS
ON BUSSES, YEAH.
- THAT'S THE SHOW.

01:23.717 --> 01:26.354
ANYWAY, WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING
EACH OTHER AROUND CAMPUS,

01:26.454 --> 01:28.622
SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D
DRIFT ON IN AND SAY HEY.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.591
- OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

01:30.691 --> 01:34.395
OH, WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE
SHARING THE KITCHEN?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.298
DO YOU MIND
IF I TAKE A CABINET?

01:38.532 --> 01:40.268
- YEAH, SURE.
- I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.935
- NO PROBLEM.
- SO WE'RE COOL WITH THAT?

01:42.035 --> 01:43.737
- YEAH.
- SEE YOU, MAN.

01:43.837 --> 01:47.341
- THANKS, DOG.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST
GAVE AWAY A CABINET.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.478
YOU NEVER
GIVE UP A CABINET.
NEVER GIVE UP A CABINET.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.481
- I GUESS I WAS STUPID.
- YOU DON'T GIVE AWAY A CABINET.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.516
- EH, I THINK IT'LL BE FINE.
- NO, IT'S NOT GONNA BE FINE.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.551
- AW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- LET'S GO, COME ON.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.158
OKAY, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.296
- SEE YOU TONIGHT.
- YEAH, OKAY.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.132
- DID I JUST SEE YOU
KISS THE HOSTESS?
- NO.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.934
- HUH-UH.
- AND SHE KISSED YOU BACK.

02:14.034 --> 02:17.137
- REALLY?
- WHAT THE HECK'S...

02:17.238 --> 02:19.407
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.242
BUT YOU'RE SHITTING
WHERE YOU EAT.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.177
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M SHITTING WHERE I EAT.
- YEAH.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.013
WE LOVE THIS RESTAURANT.
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO COME BACK HERE.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.282
INEVITABLY I WILL
BREAK UP WITH HER.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.351
- THERE'S NO QUESTION
ABOUT IT.
- UH-HUH?

02:30.451 --> 02:31.985
BUT WHEN THAT HAPPENS...

02:32.085 --> 02:33.921
- MM-HMM?
- ...I WILL COME BACK HERE.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.391
- AND I WILL SHIT WHERE I EAT.
- OR EAT WHERE YOU SHAT.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.727
- OR EAT WHERE I SHAT.
- I'VE NEVER SEEN IT DONE.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.795
- I'M HELL-BENT ON DOING IT.
- ( phone chimes )

02:41.895 --> 02:42.996
- YOU'RE HELL-BENT?
- YES.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.732
ALL RIGHT.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.401
AH, SHE TEXTED ME.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.470
SHE TEXTED YOU,
HOW ADORABLE.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.172
YEAH, A SMILEY FACE
AT THE END.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.475
OH, A SMILEY FACE.
SEE, I HATE THAT.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.710
( groans )
I TOLD HER ABOUT
THE SMILEY FACES.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.447
I CAN'T STAND IT.
AND EVERYBODY USES THEM!

02:59.547 --> 03:02.316
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- WHAT, ARE THEY GONNA BE
IN NEWSPAPERS SOON?

03:02.416 --> 03:05.085
"NEW YORK TIMES" HEADLINE:
"UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS :)"

03:05.185 --> 03:07.355
- THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED.
- Man: HEY.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.557
- HEY, STU.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU, STU?

03:09.657 --> 03:11.792
- WHAT'S UP?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HI.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.862
- HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HEY.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.599
OH, MAN, YOU KNOW,
YOUR CHEEK JUST TOUCHED
MINE ON THAT HUG.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.968
- YEAH, I HUGGED YOU.
- I KNOW, BUT STILL,

03:21.068 --> 03:23.671
CHECK-TO-CHEEK
CONTACT FROM MEN--
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.573
- I'LL REMEMBER THAT
FOR NEXT TIME.
- THAT'S A NO NO.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.441
HEY, WHY DON'T WE HAVE DINNER
ON SATURDAY NIGHT?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.744
- ARE YOU GUYS FREE?
- WELL, TO BE HONEST,

03:30.844 --> 03:33.814
THINGS AREN'T SO GREAT
WITH SUSIE AND I RIGHT NOW.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.784
I THINK IT'D BE BEST IF WE'D
BOW OUT OF SATURDAY NIGHT.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.453
- IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
- OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND.
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.655
- YEAH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'LL WORK OUT.
- ALL RIGHT, WELL THEN,

03:41.755 --> 03:43.023
SATURDAY NIGHT?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.558
SURE!
YEAH.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.827
- I'LL CALL YOU TO CONFIRM.
AWESOME.
- OKAY.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.396
- BYE, GUYS.
- OKAY, STU.

03:51.164 --> 03:55.135
- THAT IS RIGHT.
- "THINGS AREN'T
SO GREAT RIGHT NOW..."

03:55.235 --> 03:56.737
WITH SUSIE AND I,
THEY'RE NOT SO GREAT.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.606
- "...WITH SUSIE AND I."
- THEY'RE NOT GREAT.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.842
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT WAS GORGEOUS.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.645
- PERFECTION, RIGHT?
- MEANWHILE I'M HAVING DINNER
WITH THE TWO OF THEM.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.715
BY THE WAY,
THINGS MANY TIMES ARE NOT
GREAT WITH SUSIE AND I.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.318
IT'S NEVER STOPPED US
FROM GOING TO DINNER.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.721
( music playing )

04:17.325 --> 04:19.293
OH, BY THE WAY,

04:19.393 --> 04:23.063
VERY CUTE TEXT
THAT YOU SENT ME.
IT WAS VERY SWEET.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.066
BE CAREFUL ABOUT
THE SMILEY FACES.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.569
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE SMILEY FACE?
- I FEEL LIKE

04:28.669 --> 04:31.505
- I'M GETTING A TEXT
FROM A 10-YEAR-OLD.
- OKAY, I CAN DO THAT.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.040
- ALL RIGHT.
- YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

04:33.140 --> 04:34.875
- YES, I CAN. OKAY.
- OKAY?

04:37.177 --> 04:38.746
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
- MM-HMM.

04:38.846 --> 04:42.182
DO YOU SEE
ANYTHING ON MY FOREHEAD?
IS THERE A LITTLE MARK THERE?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.251
- Y-YEAH.
- HUH.

04:44.352 --> 04:48.121
- I'LL GO SEE DR. RIVKIN.
- WHY ARE WE TALKING
INSTEAD OF KISSING?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.591
WHY CAN'T YOU
KISS AND TALK?

04:50.691 --> 04:53.561
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST FEEL LIKE EATING
WHILE YOU'RE TALKING--

04:53.661 --> 04:56.597
- IT'S NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
- IT SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD TO ME.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.666
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU KNOW, I TALK DURING
INTERCOURSE TOO.

04:58.766 --> 04:59.767
- YOU DO?
- YES.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.735
- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.
- OKAY.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.805
- ( door opens )
- THAT IS SO FUNNY.
HEY, GUYS.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.741
I JUST SAW THIS
HILARIOUS YouTube VIDEO.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.578
THIS WOMAN,
SHE GETS ROBBED, RIGHT?

05:10.678 --> 05:12.413
AND, UM-- WELL,
THAT'S NOT THE FUNNY PART.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.882
I'M SORRY, LARRY,
THIS IS MY NEICE MIMI.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.485
- SHE'S JUST STAYING WITH ME
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
- HELLO.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.787
THE FUNNY THING IS MY MOM'S
THE ONE WHO SENT IT TO ME.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.423
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE KNEW
HOW TO USE YouTube.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.659
HEY, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE MAKING OUT HERE.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.395
SORRY.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.563
I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T KNOW.
'CAUSE I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.499
YOU CAN TALK
AND MAKE OUT.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.367
WELL, NOT IF IT'S GOOD.

05:33.467 --> 05:37.104
- THAT'S REALLY
NOT YOUR CONCERN.
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.807
OKAY, NOW YOU'VE HEARD
OF IT. TSK.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.909
- Larry: GOOD NIGHT.
- ENJOY YOUR--

05:42.009 --> 05:44.077
- HERE, TAKE THE BOWL WITH YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.947
- Heidi: GOOD NIGHT,
SWEETHEART.
- THANKS, GOOD NIGHT.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.281
HAVE FUN TALKING.
HA HA.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.684
MAYBE THIS IS

05:50.784 --> 05:52.920
A GOOD BREAK
IN THE ACTION.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.788
- OH, OKAY.
- YEAH OKAY.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.657
NO PROBLEM.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.526
OH GOODNESS.
BUT THAT WAS FUN.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.194
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.897
- OH, YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME.
- OH, DO YOU HAVE ANY CASH?

06:03.997 --> 06:06.467
JUST I CAN PAY YOU BACK
WHEN I SEE YOU AT
THE RESTAURANT.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.902
- SURE, YEAH.
- I TOTALLY FORGOT
I HAVE TO GET UP

06:09.002 --> 06:11.472
AND GO TO THE FARMER'S
MARKET AND I JUST NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF--

06:11.572 --> 06:13.240
- HOW ABOUT 60 BUCKS?
THERE YOU GO.
- 60 BUCKS,

06:13.340 --> 06:15.576
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- BYE.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.645
BYE.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.807
- ( sighs )
- HEY, LARRY.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.611
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:50.711 --> 06:53.280
- IT'S NOT GOING SO GREAT.
- WHY'S THAT?

06:53.380 --> 06:55.382
WHY'S THAT?
LOOK AT THIS!

06:55.483 --> 06:57.718
WHAT'D YOU DO?
YOU STUFFED ME
INTO ONE CABINET!

06:57.818 --> 06:59.953
LOOKS LIKE IT ALL
FIT IN THERE.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.690
I GAVE YOU A CABINET.
YOU TOOK TWO?

07:02.790 --> 07:06.293
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
WE HAVE THE SAME
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.261
WELL, RIGHT NOW I HAVE
TWO PEOPLE, YEAH,

07:08.361 --> 07:11.198
BUT I TOLD YOU
I'M DOING THE SHARK SHOW.
THEY'RE GONNA BE BACK.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.801
- WHEN?
WHEN ARE THEY COMING BACK?
- I DON'T KNOW, LARRY.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.169
WHEN THEY'RE DONE
SHOOTING THE SHARKS,
THEY WILL COME BACK.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.673
YOU WANT TO BE
FAIR ABOUT THIS THING?
I'LL TAKE THIS CABINET,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.242
YOU TAKE THAT CABINET
AND WE'LL SPLIT THIS ONE.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.877
NO.

07:23.977 --> 07:27.347
THIS STAYS EXACTLY
THE WAY IT IS.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.650
OKAY?
PEACE, BROTHER.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.519
PEACE.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.855
( phone rings )

07:34.955 --> 07:38.425

07:38.526 --> 07:41.995

07:42.095 --> 07:43.931
HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

07:44.031 --> 07:46.767

07:46.867 --> 07:50.003
UH, ABOUT THE SAME,
I THINK, YEAH.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.540
HAVE THE DOCTORS...

07:52.640 --> 07:54.074
TOLD YOU ANYTHING?

07:54.174 --> 07:56.944
OH, YOU KNOW DOCTORS.
THEY DON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.480
WHAT KIND OF MOOD ARE THEY IN
WHEN THEY-- WHEN THEY
TALK TO YOU?

08:00.581 --> 08:03.951
DO THEY KIND OF HUDDLE
TOGETHER AND WHISPER?

08:04.051 --> 08:05.653
NO.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.855
DO THEY SEEM MOROSE?

08:07.955 --> 08:09.489
LUGUBRIOUS?

08:09.590 --> 08:12.092
NO, THEY TAKE TESTS
AND I--

08:12.192 --> 08:13.794
I DON'T KNOW
IF I PASS OR FAIL.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.028
HMM.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.698
- IS ANTOINETTE THERE?
- Hold on a second.

08:17.798 --> 08:21.902
HEY, THANKS FOR CALLING.
THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.773
SO BIG DOG PRODUCTIONS RENTED
THE OFFICE NEXT DOOR AND THEY'RE
SHARING THE KITCHEN WITH US.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.941
AND I HAD TO GIVE UP
A CABINET.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.911
LARRY, NO!
YOU NEVER GIVE UP A CABINET.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.614
NEVER EVER GIVE UP
A CABINET.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.282
- He actually took two.
- ( sighs )

08:35.382 --> 08:38.586
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO BE HERE.
CAN'T YOU COME IN FOR A DAY?

08:38.686 --> 08:42.155
YOU KNOW,
STRAIGHTEN UP A LITTLE BIT.
MAYBE YOU CAN GET ONE BACK.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.524
( groans )
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

08:44.625 --> 08:48.428
- Oh, terrific.
- WHY ARE YOU NOT WITH RICHARD
RIGHT NOW?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.564
- You were supposed
to have lunch with Lewis.
- AH!

08:50.664 --> 08:53.500
I'M 15 MINUTES LATE ALREADY!
SEE, THIS IS WHY I NEED YOU
TO COME IN.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.302
I'll be there tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.170
AHH!

08:59.006 --> 09:01.441
- I'M SO SORRY,
HONEST TO GOD.
- OH!

09:01.541 --> 09:03.143
OH, YOU DECIDE
TO SHOW UP AFTER ALL.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.579
SO SORRY.
NO, I WAS AT
THE DERMATOLOGIST.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.715
AND HE KEPT ME
WAITING FOR 45 MINUTES.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.117
- 45 MINUTE-- RIVKIN DID?
- 45-- YES!

09:10.217 --> 09:12.920
HE MADE YOU WAIT FOR 45--
ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.488
- NO!
- YOUR VOICE JUST WENT UP.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.490
- WHAT? SO WHAT?
- THAT MEANS YOU'RE LYING.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.360
- GET OUT, NO!
- PEOPLE WHO DO THAT,
THAT MEANS THEY'RE LYING.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.996
- I WAS JUST BEING EMPHATIC.
- THE WHOLE WATERGATE TRIAL,

09:23.096 --> 09:24.898
( high-pitched )
THEY WENT "NO, I WASN'T THERE!"

09:24.998 --> 09:26.834
- OKAY, BUT I WAS
BEING EMPHATIC.
- RIVKIN?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.836
- BOY, THAT REALLY
BURNS ME, MAN.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.304
I'M REALLY--

'CAUSE HE'S A COOL GUY

09:31.404 --> 09:34.541
AND NOW HE'S TURNING
INTO ONE OF THOSE GUYS
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

09:34.642 --> 09:38.311
YOU KNOW, THEY KEEP YOU WAITING
THERE IN THE ROOM THERE
WITH 1300 OTHER PEOPLE.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.649

A BAD BURN

09:41.749 --> 09:44.384
- AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME.
- WELL, THIS IS BULLSHIT.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.755
- IT'S NOT HIS FAULT!
HE HAD A BURN VICTIM.
- HE'S MY DOCTOR, WHY CAN'T--

09:47.855 --> 09:49.556
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

09:49.657 --> 09:52.592
- Both: HI.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.762

09:57.931 --> 10:01.034
HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.
WOW, YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT HEIDI.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.704
- DID YOU GO
TO THE FARMER'S MARKET?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

10:03.804 --> 10:07.274
I OVERSLEPT, SO I WENT
TO WHOLE FOODS INSTEAD
AND I USED MY CREDIT CARD.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.478
- SO YOU STILL GOT THE $60.
- YEAH.

10:11.578 --> 10:15.415
ANYWAY, I DIDN'T
WANT TO INTERRUPT.
I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI

10:15.515 --> 10:17.751
AND TELL YOU
TO HAVE A NICE LUNCH.
IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.519
- PLEASURE.
- THANK YOU.
HAVE A GOOD MEAL.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.154

OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?
- I KNOW.

10:23.724 --> 10:27.460
- YOU DON'T SHIT WHERE YOU EAT.

RESTAURANT.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.330

YOU'RE NOT GONNA STICK WITH HER.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.933

TO COME HERE AGAIN.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.970
- OH, WON'T I?
- I SHAT WHERE I ATE

10:37.070 --> 10:39.239

AND BEVERLY HILLS.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.909
- I'M DOWN TO FOUR RESTAURANTS.
- MM-HMM.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.778
MR. CHOW'S-- OUT.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.648
SO, YOU KNOW,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.217
I SAY THAT I WILL
EAT HERE AGAIN.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.418
- OH REALLY?

10:51.518 --> 10:54.321
I WILL BE
THE EDMUND HILLARY...

10:54.421 --> 10:56.489

10:56.589 --> 10:57.691
- YOU THINK SO?
- YES YES.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.459
- THE FIRST GUY?
- THE FIRST GUY.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.796
- UNTIL THAT HAPPENS,
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- HEY, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.598
- SURE.
- SO YESTERDAY
SHE TOOK $60 FROM ME.

11:05.699 --> 11:06.934
- I HEARD, YEAH.
- TO GO SHOPPING.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.903
- BUT SHE DIDN'T USE IT?
- SO?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.339
IT'S-- SHOULDN'T SHE BE
GIVING IT BACK?

11:12.439 --> 11:16.443
WHAT'S $60 BY COMPARISON
TO INTERCOURSE WITH A WOMAN
LIKE THAT?

11:16.543 --> 11:18.645
STILL, IT'S A QUESTION
OF CHARACTER.

11:18.746 --> 11:21.514
- YOU KNOW.
- I'M SORRY, MR. LINCOLN.

11:21.614 --> 11:25.218
- YOU'RE A FUCKING SCHMUCK.
- WELL, WE DON'T SEE IT
THE SAME WAY.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.622
- HAPPY?
- OH!

11:29.723 --> 11:31.058
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
- FABULOUS.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.793
THIS IS WHAT A DESK
SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.228
YEAH, HOW DID IT GET
THAT WAY, BY THE WAY?

11:35.328 --> 11:36.764
YOU KNOW, IT JUST BUILDS UP.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.999

11:43.303 --> 11:46.706
YOU CAME IN FOR ONE DAY,
TOMORROW YOU'LL GO BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.742
AND I AM GONNA GET
THAT CABINET BACK FOR US.

11:48.842 --> 11:53.446
YOU GET THAT CABINET BACK,
THERE'LL BE A LITTLE SOMETHING
IN IT FOR YOU.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.883
OKAY, I'M GONNA JUST
UNPACK THAT STUFF.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.818
- GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.305
- YES YES!
- IT'S VERY EXCITING.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.908
YOU KNOW
I'M TAKING OUT THE HOSTESS
FROM THE RESTAURANT?

12:21.008 --> 12:23.476

- YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T BE
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S NOT.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.519
- NO, I WOULD BE.
- ANYWAYS.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.856
BUT I AM DYING TO KNOW
WHY IN THE HELL AREN'T
JEFF AND SUSIE COMING?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.891

12:37.991 --> 12:39.860

12:39.960 --> 12:41.094
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- YEAH.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.130
I DON'T KNOW.
HE DIDN'T TELL ME.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.598
- IS HE HAVING AN AFFAIR?
- ( high-pitched ) NO!

12:45.698 --> 12:47.300

12:53.140 --> 12:54.741
- COME ON.
- IS HE HAVING AN AFFAIR?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.176
( deeply )
NO NO!

12:56.276 --> 12:58.478
- LARRY--
- NO, HE'S NOT
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.647
WE'RE NOT GONNA SAY A WORD,
SO DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.082
IT DOESN'T MATTER
AND YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.

13:02.182 --> 13:05.285
- I HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.
- WE KNOW NOTHING.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.988
IT'S TRUE, YOU DO KNOW NOTHING.
THERE'S NOTHING TO KNOW.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.223

- WE'LL SEE YOU.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.159

13:17.164 --> 13:20.333
UH...
OKAY, YEAH, I'LL BE THERE.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.841
MY DAD JUST DIED.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.743
MY MOM-- THE LAST THING
HE SAID WAS

13:30.844 --> 13:33.413
"WHERE'S ANTOINETTE?"

13:33.513 --> 13:35.415
GUESS WHERE I WAS.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.187
HUH.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.961
THAT IS WHAT
WE CALL IN MY BUSINESS
A BENIGN KERATOSIS.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.262
YOU'LL BE FINE.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.132
I WAS SICK FROM THIS,
HONEST TO GOD.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.134
I'M GLAD YOU CAME IN.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

13:54.234 --> 13:57.104
IS COVER THIS
WITH A LITTLE 100 SUNBLOCK
AND YOU'LL BE FINE.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.207
- ALL RIGHT, 100-- PRETTY HIGH.
- YEAH WELL, IT DOES THE JOB.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.442
LOOK, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.179
I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT ANTOINETTE'S
FATHER JIM.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.881
AH, WELL.

14:07.981 --> 14:11.384
YOU KNOW THAT HE AND I
USED TO PLAY IN A BAND
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.054
- RIGHT!
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
ANTOINETTE CALLED ME RECENTLY

14:14.154 --> 14:16.523
AND ASKED ME TO PLAY
AT HIS FUNERAL.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.391
I'M PLAYING

14:18.491 --> 14:19.927
"DANNY BOY" ON THE FLUTE.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.895
- IS THAT SO?
- AS THEY LOWER THE CASKET.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.030
- OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- YEAH.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.598
ALL RIGHT, I'M ON MY WAY.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.868
OH, LISTEN, ONE OTHER THING.
RICHARD LEWIS, HE'S A FRIEND
OF YOURS, IS HE NOT?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.370

HE RECENTLY CANCELED
AN APPOINTMENT WITH ME

14:34.241 --> 14:37.344
AT THE LAST MINUTE
AND HASN'T RESCHEDULED YET.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.447
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHY SUCH
A THING WOULD TAKE PLACE?

14:40.547 --> 14:41.982
NOPE.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.317
AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO
HE HAS REFERED TO ME

14:44.417 --> 14:47.054
HAVE CANCELED
AT THE LAST MINUTE
AND HAVE NOT RESCHEDULED.

14:47.154 --> 14:50.323
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY--
- NO!

14:52.859 --> 14:54.227
WELL, IT'S A MYSTERY TO ME.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.496
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
HE'S A LITTLE NUTTY.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.697
- YOU KNOW.
- THIS I KNOW.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.232
LISTEN, AS LONG
AS YOU'RE HERE,

14:59.332 --> 15:01.234
IT'S BEEN ABOUT TWO YEARS
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.103
- OKAY.
- I NEED TO LOOK YOU OVER

15:03.203 --> 15:05.805
- FROM HEAD TO TOE.
- THE FULL BODY SCAN
IN MY UNDERWEAR?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.507
IT'S IMPORTANT I TAKE
A LOOK AT YOU.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.343
- I'M VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THAT, FRANKLY.
- I KNOW YOU ARE.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.480
YOU-YOU LOOK AT MY PENIS.
I-I-- I DON'T-- I DON'T LIKE IT.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.682
IT WILL BE THE BRIEFEST LOOK
AT YOUR PENIS, BELIEVE ME.

15:15.782 --> 15:19.186
I HAVE TO MASTURBATE
BEFORE I COME SO I
EXHAUST THE AREA.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.288
- IT'S A WHOLE TO-DO.
- IT'S ROUTINE.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.656
IT'S ROUTINE AND IT IS
STRICTLY NECESSARY, ALL RIGHT?

15:23.756 --> 15:27.394
- SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL MAKE AN APPOINTMENT--
- THANKS, DOC, I DON'T THINK SO.

15:35.568 --> 15:38.371
I HOPE YOU'RE PLANNING
ON PUTTING THAT STUFF
AWAY SOMEWHERE.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.274
YEAH, I AM PUTTING IT AWAY.
RIGHT HERE.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.411
I HAVE NO SPACE IN HERE,
SO WHERE DO YOU SUGGEST
I PUT IT?

15:44.511 --> 15:47.180
WE'VE GOT SOME GROUND RULES
WE'VE GOTTA MAKE HERE, RIGHT?

15:47.280 --> 15:50.350
THIS SPACE
HAS TO REMAIN CLEAN!

15:50.450 --> 15:53.853
THERE CAN BE NO BULLSHIT
ON THIS COUNTER,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.089
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOOK MY STUFF

15:56.189 --> 15:58.425
OUT OF THESE TWO CABINETS
AND PUT IT INTO THIS ONE.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.128
YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S UNFAIR
THE AMOUNT OF CABINET SPACE

16:01.228 --> 16:03.030
- THAT I'VE TAKEN?
- YES YES.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.532
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
ABOUT DOG THAT EVERYBODY
KNOWS, OKAY?

LABELS!

16:18.411 --> 16:22.215
LOOK, BIG DOG DOES NOT
GIVE UP CABINETS.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.385
- WELL, GUESS WHAT, BIG DOG.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.588
THIS FOOD IS STAYING HERE
BECAUSE I HAVE NO PLACE
TO PUT IT!

16:28.688 --> 16:31.391
THIS ISN'T EVEN FOOD.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.660

WHAT DO YOU GOT IN HERE?
OH, CHEESE DIPS-- COME ON.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.139
THIS WEIGHS ALMOST FIVE LBS.
YOU EAT THIS?
YOU PUT THIS IN YOUR BODY?

16:46.239 --> 16:47.674
YEAH, IT'S GOOD BREAD.
IT HAS NO YEAST IN IT.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.376
- IT'S NOT BREAD.
- THAT'S BREAD, THAT'S BREAD.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.212
BY THE WAY, I SAW THE SHOW?
IT STINKS.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.782
THE SHARKS ARE SWIMMING AROUND.
NOBODY'S EVEN-- THE SHARKS
AREN'T EATING ANYBODY.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.118
- NOTHING'S GOING ON,
JUST SHARKS SWIMMING AROUND.
- ARE YOU GETTING NEGATIVE

16:58.218 --> 16:59.486
- ABOUT MY SHOW?
- YEAH, YOUR SHOW STINKS.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.222
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT CALLING YOU DOG ANYMORE.

17:02.322 --> 17:06.159
THE DOG DAYS ARE OVER.
FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE DINO!

17:06.259 --> 17:08.395
- JESUS CHRIST, CALM DOWN.
- FUCK YOU, DOG!

17:08.495 --> 17:10.197

"FUCK YOU, DOG" TO ME?

17:10.297 --> 17:12.432
TAKE YOUR FUCKING RABBIT FOOD

17:12.532 --> 17:17.036
AND YOUR GODDAMN FIVE-LB BREAD

FUCKING ASS!

17:19.239 --> 17:21.908
- FINALLY THE GUY DIES.
- OH MY GOD.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.810
SHE FOUND OUT ON THE PHONE
IN MY OFFICE, YEAH.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.012
OH MY GOD,
THAT'S AWFUL.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.181
I KNOW-- I KNOW WHAT
SHE MUST BE GOING THROUGH

17:28.281 --> 17:30.450
BECAUSE MY DAD DIED
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.453
HUH.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.627
WHAT-- WHAT WAS THAT?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.995
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE
TO SAY WHEN I TELL YOU
MY FATHER DIED?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.864
WHAT SHOULD I HAVE SAID?

17:44.964 --> 17:48.000
"I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT."

17:48.101 --> 17:50.036
"SAD NEWS"?

17:50.137 --> 17:53.240
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

17:53.340 --> 17:55.975
DON'T YOU THINK THE SORRY WINDOW
HAS CLOSED ON THAT?

17:56.075 --> 17:59.712
THE SORRY WINDOW?
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
A SORRY WINDOW.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.749
TWO YEARS,
YOU'RE STILL GETTING SORRIES?
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.286
- THAT'S A LONG TIME
FOR SORRIES.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.821
THAT'S LIKE SAYING
"HAPPY NEW YEAR" IN OCTOBER.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.457
( scoffs )
IT'S DIFFERENT.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.560
OH SHIT.
I FORGOT TO PUT SUNBLOCK ON.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.129
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO PUT IT ON FOR YOU?
- YEAH, THANKS.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.664
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.169
OH, UM, BY THE WAY,

18:22.269 --> 18:24.036
- YOU KNOW THAT PEN
YOU LOANED ME?
- YEAH.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.973
I'M JUST GONNA RETURN IT.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.675
BUT I DON'T--
I DON'T NEED IT.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.245
- YOU CAN KEEP IT.
- TURNS OUT I DIDN'T
NEED IT EITHER.

18:32.345 --> 18:36.249
BUT WHEN I BORROW SOMETHING,
I RETURN.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.585
BORROW, RETURN.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.086
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.455
IS THIS ABOUT--

18:42.555 --> 18:45.758
IS THIS ABOUT THE 60--
THE 60 BUCKS THAT YOU LENT ME?

18:45.858 --> 18:47.260
NO, OF COURSE NOT!

18:47.360 --> 18:50.597
ALTHOUGH, I MEAN,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.800
I DID GIVE YOU $60.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.337
I GUESS IT'S KIND OF, WHAT?
IN YOUR WALLET NOW.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.439
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.841
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
ACTUALLY NEED

19:01.941 --> 19:04.444
TO GET $60 BACK FROM ME.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.779
THAT I PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU
AT SOME POINT ANYWAY.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.281
I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD HAVE.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.917
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?

19:11.017 --> 19:14.187
I'VE REALLY TRIED,
BUT THE TRUTH IS

19:14.287 --> 19:16.589
- I THINK THIS HAS
RUN ITS COURSE.
- HUH.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.658
- IT'S A BREAKUP.
- YEAH, IT'S A BREAKUP.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.060
IS THIS 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
SAY I'M SORRY?

19:21.160 --> 19:24.831
- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
- NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE I'M SORRY.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.766
DID YOU GET THE WHOLE HEAD?

19:26.866 --> 19:31.070
YES, I DID.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.840
- ( huffs )
- ( door closes )

19:48.721 --> 19:51.458
OH!

19:55.828 --> 19:58.197
SORRY.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.333
I'M VERY SORRY.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.438
TERRIBLY SORRY.
SO SORRY.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.973
EXCUSE ME.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.376
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
ON YOUR HEAD.

20:09.476 --> 20:12.979
I BELIEVE THEY REFER TO THAT
AS A SMILEY FACE.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.315
THEY'RE FREQUENTLY
USED BY IDIOTS

20:15.415 --> 20:17.784
AT THE END OF EMAILS
AND TEXT MESSAGES,

20:17.884 --> 20:21.588
SUCH AS "I MISS YOU. :)"

20:21.688 --> 20:24.757
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
APPROPRIATE FOR A FUNERAL.
- IT'S NOT.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.360
YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
NOT MUCH I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.762
I HAVE A HAT IN MY CAR.
IT'S A DODGER HAT.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.365
YEAH, I HATE THE DODGERS.
THAT'S OKAY.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.504
MOM, IT'S LARRY.
HI, LARRY.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.206
SO SORRY.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.642
LARRY, YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.478
I BELIEVE THAT'S CALLED
A SMILEY FACE.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.582
- WHAT'S IT DOING THERE?
- WELL, A DISGRUNTLED WOMAN

20:49.682 --> 20:53.219
DREW IT WITH SUNBLOCK
AND THEN I FELL ASLEEP
IN THE SUN.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.855
SHE OWED ME $60
AND WOULDN'T PAY ME,

20:55.955 --> 20:58.758
SO I-- I BROUGHT IT UP.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.427
- IT'S NOT HERS!
- RIGHT.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.862
- IT'S NOT HERS.
IT'S MY MONEY.
- RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.264
- MOM, I'M GONNA GO GET
A GLASS OF WATER, OKAY?
- AM I CRAZY?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.099
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- ROSEMARY, AM I CRAZY?

21:07.199 --> 21:08.601
- WELL, UM...
- HUH?

21:08.701 --> 21:11.538
- THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
- YEAH.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.206
THEY LOVED EACH OTHER VERY MUCH.
IT'S VERY HARD ON HER.

21:14.307 --> 21:18.778
AND SHE WAS NOT
AT HER FATHER'S BEDSIDE
WHEN HE PASSED AWAY.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.048
YOU KNOW, THE BEDSIDE'S
A LITTLE OVERRATED, FRANKLY.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.050
NOT THAT MUCH GOES ON THERE.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.453
YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA SAY
"ROSEBUD" OR SOMETHING.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.221
THEY'RE NOT SAYING ROSEBUD,
WHATEVER THAT IS.

21:29.322 --> 21:32.992
OBVIOUSLY SHE'S GRIEVING
DEEPLY FOR HER FATHER.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.027
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THE...

21:35.127 --> 21:36.963
GRIEVING PROCESS

21:37.063 --> 21:39.298
MIGHT TAKE FOR HER?

21:39.399 --> 21:42.402
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
PROBABLY SEVERAL WEEKS

21:42.502 --> 21:44.637
FOR MY DAUGHTER
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.273
MMMM, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE--

21:47.374 --> 21:49.609
MAYBE I COULD FILL IN FOR HER.

21:49.709 --> 21:53.413
- REALLY?
- I WAS AN EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
FOR 30 YEARS.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.683
WOW, THIS IS A VERY
EXCITING AND INTERESTING IDEA.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.051
I REALLY NEED SOMETHING
TO DO RIGHT NOW

21:59.151 --> 22:00.887
TO TAKE MY MIND
OFF OF MY GRIEF.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.323
AND I WOULD BE HOLDING
THE JOB FOR MY DAUGHTER.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.059
- YOU'RE SHITTING ME?
- NOT SHITTING.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.128
- NO SHIT?
- NO SHIT.

22:09.228 --> 22:10.997
- LET'S DO IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.633
UH, MONDAY MORNING.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.802
- DEAL. ( giggles )
- DEAL.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.705
DON'T WEAR THAT HAT.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.441
Man:
I FIRST MET JIMMY
IN 1968.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.410
I WAS FRESH
OUT OF BUSINESS SCHOOL,

22:23.510 --> 22:26.446
CLUTCHING MY LITTLE
C.P.A. DEGREE IN MY
HOT HAND.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.481
HE SAW A LITTLE PIECE
OF MUSIC

22:28.581 --> 22:30.917
STICKING OUT OF THE CORNER
OF MY BRIEFCASE.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.921
AND HE SAID, "YOU PLAY?"
HE HIRED ME THAT DAY

22:35.021 --> 22:36.756
RIGHT ON THE SPOT.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.792
HE THOUGHT I HAD
A LOT OF PASSION--
PASSION FOR MUSIC

22:39.892 --> 22:42.462
- AND PASSION
FOR ACCOUNTING...
- RICHARD?

22:42.562 --> 22:44.764
I ONCE SAID TO
HIS WIFE ROSEMARY...

22:44.864 --> 22:46.699
HOW'S THAT RASH?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.436
DO YOU CARE-- HONESTLY?

22:49.536 --> 22:51.337
MORE THAN YOU DO APPARENTLY.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.773
YOU CANCELED
OUR APPOINTMENT LAST WEEK.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.476
I CANCELED MY APPOINTMENT
BECAUSE YOU MADE LARRY DAVID

22:56.576 --> 22:58.778
WAIT 45 MINUTES
BEFORE YOU SAW HIM.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.748
NO WAY I'M WAITING
45 MINUTES FOR ANY DOCTOR,
LET ALONE YOU OR ANY--

23:01.848 --> 23:03.550
WAIT WAIT WAIT.
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.385
I MADE LARRY DAVID
WAIT 45 MINUTES
FOR AN APPOINTMENT?

23:06.486 --> 23:09.388
- THAT'S WHAT HE
TOLD ME RIGHT TO MY FACE.
- NONSENSE. THAT'S A LIE.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.459
I NEVER LET
ANY OF MY PATIENTS
WAIT 45 MINUTES.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.060
THAT IS A BOLDFACED LIE.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.897
I'M SAYING
HE LIED.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.398
WHAT AN ASSHOLE HE IS.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.634
WHAT AN ASSHOLE
HE IS.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.436
I'M SORRY.
I STILL HAVE THE RASH.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.772
THAT JERK.

23:35.181 --> 23:39.118
* CAMPTOWN LADIES SING
THIS SONG, DOO-DAH DOO-DAH *

23:39.218 --> 23:42.388
* A CAMPTOWN RACETRACK
FIVE MILES LONG, DOO-DEE
DOO-DEE DAY *

23:42.489 --> 23:44.757
- * GOING TO RUN ALL NIGHT...
- ( honks )

23:44.857 --> 23:46.325
* GOING TO--

23:46.425 --> 23:49.562
PULL OVER, MR. DAVID, PLEASE.
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.765
THANK YOU.

23:57.036 --> 24:01.541
WHAT THIS I HEAR?
I MADE YOU WAIT 3/4s
OF AN HOUR?

24:01.641 --> 24:04.043
YEAH, SORRY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.278
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT
SUNBURN ON YOUR HEAD?

24:06.378 --> 24:08.180
- THAT'S--
- LOOK, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.550
YOU HAVE SLANDERED ME,
MY FRIEND.

24:10.650 --> 24:14.587
SORRY.
I WAS-- I WAS LATE FOR THIS
LUNCH WITH RICHARD LEWIS

24:14.687 --> 24:17.557
AND I'VE BEEN LATE A FEW TIMES
WITH HIM AND I NEED AN EXCUSE

24:17.657 --> 24:20.192
AND I'M-- I'M SORRY.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.196
- YOU'LL TALK TO MR. LEWIS?
- I'M GONNA TELL HIM.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.433
YOU'LL SUBMIT TO A FULL...

24:27.534 --> 24:29.569
BODY SURVEY?

24:29.669 --> 24:32.839
IF YOU DON'T SNEAK A PEEK
AT THE PENIS, I'LL-- I'LL--

24:32.939 --> 24:35.307
- I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.
- OKAY.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.877
WHERE THE HELL'S
THE PROCESSION?

24:37.977 --> 24:41.113
I'M SUPPOSED TO PLAY
"DANNY BOY" ON MY FLUTE
AT THE GRAVESIDE!

24:41.213 --> 24:44.150
WHERE THE HELL'S THE CEMETERY?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

24:44.250 --> 24:45.852
I DON'T KNOW.

24:45.952 --> 24:49.088
WHERE DID THEY GO?

24:49.188 --> 24:52.725
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
DR. RIVKIN IS.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.194
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

24:55.294 --> 24:58.264
I HEAR
HE KEEPS HIS PATIENTS
WAITING ALL THE TIME.

24:58.364 --> 25:01.601
YEAH WELL, I'M CANCELING
MY APPOINTMENT.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.471
EXCUSE ME, LARRY.
HERE'S YOUR TEA.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.874
- OH WOW, LOOK AT THAT.
- THERE YOU ARE.

25:07.974 --> 25:10.209
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.512
BY THE WAY, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU'RE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB.

25:13.613 --> 25:16.015
- THANK YOU, LARRY.
- I'M VERY VERY PLEASED.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.217
I LIKE THIS NEW SYSTEM
YOU INSTALLED HERE.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.520
YOU PUT MY CHANGE IN HERE.
THE VACCUM-SEALED NUTS--

25:21.621 --> 25:23.355
I MEAN, COME ON.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.357
AND I AM GOING TO GET
THAT CABINET BACK.

25:25.457 --> 25:26.826
I BET YOU WILL.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.228
OH, YOU MUST BE
MR. GREENE.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.330
- THAT I AM.
- ROSEMARY.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.733
- HI ROSEMARY.
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.771
- YOU FIRED ANTOINETTE?
- NO, THAT'S HER MOTHER.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.573
- IT'S HER MOM?
- YEAH.

25:40.673 --> 25:44.010
SHE'S AMAZING!
I'D LOVE TO FIRE ANTOINETTE
AND HIRE HER PERMANENTLY.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.078
I CAN'T DO THAT.
NOBODY COULD PULL THAT OFF.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.314
- IMPOSSIBLE.
- READY TO GO TO LUNCH?

25:48.414 --> 25:51.217
- I'M JUST GONNA RUN
TO THE BATHROOM.
- MM-HMM.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.891
- EXCUSE ME.
- IT'S OKAY.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.727
I'LL JUST PUT THESE
ON HIS DESK.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.229
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU HOLDING UP OKAY?

26:03.329 --> 26:06.132
( tearfully )
I MUST TELL YOU, AT TIMES
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

26:06.232 --> 26:10.002
BECAUSE I DO MISS HIM
VERY VERY MUCH.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.779
( huffs )

26:21.547 --> 26:23.315
HEY, DOG!

26:23.415 --> 26:27.586
THAT'S MY KITCHEN TOO!
I'VE GOT A CABINET IN THERE!

26:28.587 --> 26:30.723
HEY, LARRY.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.859
HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.794
- ( whimpers )
- OH, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.729
HEY, WE'RE SO EXCITED TO HAVE
DINNER WITH YOU GUYS.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.331
WE'RE EXCITED TO HANG OUT
WITH HEIDI-- HEIDI, RIGHT?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.500
OH, UM...

26:41.600 --> 26:43.069
PFFT, YOU KNOW WHAT, STU?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.638
- I'M SO SORRY.
- NO, LARRY, DON'T.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.340
THE THING IS THINGS AREN'T
GREAT RIGHT NOW

26:48.440 --> 26:49.909
BETWEEN ME AND HEIDI.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.711
MM-HMM.
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA USE

26:51.811 --> 26:53.646
THE SAME BULLSHIT EXCUSE
THAT JEFF DID?

26:53.746 --> 26:56.783
- THAT THINGS
AREN'T GREAT RIGHT NOW?
- I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

26:56.883 --> 26:59.051
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THE TRUTH?

26:59.151 --> 27:01.688
- YES!
- AND JEFF'S
TELLING ME THE TRUTH?

27:01.788 --> 27:03.222
( high-pitched )
YEAH, YES!

27:03.322 --> 27:04.757
UH-OH.

27:04.857 --> 27:07.994
- JEFF WAS LYING?
- YEAH.

27:08.094 --> 27:11.864
OH SHIT.
OH, WE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.066
MIRIAM TOLD SUSIE THAT--

27:14.166 --> 27:16.035
THAT JEFF'S
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.671
WHAT, IS SHE INSANE?
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

27:18.771 --> 27:21.373
BECAUSE YOUR VOICE--
WHEN WE CAME TO YOUR OFFICE
YOUR VOICE WENT UP.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.176
- SO SUSIE THINKS THEY'RE
HAVING AN AFFAIR?
- YES.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.645
( music playing )

27:37.556 --> 27:40.827
- SO YOU THINK THAT MY WIFE
HAS A BIG MOUTH?
- ( deeply ) YES!

27:40.927 --> 27:44.463
- IS THAT WHY JEFF DOESN'T WANT
TO GO TO DINNER WITH US?
- ( deeply ) YES!

27:44.563 --> 27:46.766
- SUSIE!
- PHILANDERING

27:46.866 --> 27:48.935

27:51.804 --> 27:53.740
- NO, SUSIE! NO!
- Rosemary: LEAVE HIM ALONE!

27:53.840 --> 27:56.242
- Susie: WHO IS THIS
FUCKING WHORE YOU'RE WITH?
- ( slaps )

27:56.342 --> 27:58.244
Jeff:
HEY, THAT'S
ANTOINETTE'S MOTHER.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.646
YOU'RE FUCKING
ANTOINETTE'S MOTHER?
THAT'S SICK!

28:00.747 --> 28:02.849
- ( slaps )
- Rosemary: STOP PLEASE.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.686
( whistles )

28:09.421 --> 28:11.958
- ( forced laugh )
- HELLO.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.827
UM, I ASKED YOU
NOT TO COME HERE.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.563
YES, I KNOW,
BUT I SHAT WHERE I ATE.

28:17.663 --> 28:20.867
AND NOW I SHALL
EAT WHERE I SHAT.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.102
MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU IS OVER,

28:23.202 --> 28:25.637
BUT MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH THIS RESTAURANT

28:25.738 --> 28:27.373
LIVES ON.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.055
IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH YOUR MEAL?

28:43.155 --> 28:47.126
- DID YOU PUT
SOMETHING IN THE FOOD?
- ( high-pitched ) NO!

28:48.895 --> 28:51.297
( theme music playing )
