03:21.501 --> 03:24.470
Hey Rahul, will you be my friend?

04:06.713 --> 04:08.510
Looks just like her father.

04:09.716 --> 04:10.182
Doesn't she?

04:12.051 --> 04:14.019
Tina is very critical, Rahul.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.687
She's counting her days.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.682
We tried very hard.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.858
But, her internal bleeding
was so much that,

04:21.226 --> 04:22.524
We were left stranded.

04:23.062 --> 04:23.858
She had known it.

04:24.230 --> 04:27.859
I had told her that there'll be
complications in her delivery.

04:28.234 --> 04:31.362
But, she also knew about
your love for this child.

04:32.739 --> 04:36.197
She also loved her child
more than her life.

04:37.744 --> 04:43.376
I want my daughter to know
who & what her mother was?

04:44.584 --> 04:46.552
Let her find the answers
on her own.

04:48.254 --> 04:54.056
Mother, I'm leaving these
8 letters with you.

04:55.928 --> 04:58.897
A letter for each of her birthday.

05:00.099 --> 05:04.229
They contain everything which I would
like to share with my daughter.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.237
These will remain as her
sweet memories.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.091
You're very good.

05:30.963 --> 05:31.759
You're very bad.

05:38.137 --> 05:42.267
Rahul, hey Rahul!

05:51.317 --> 05:52.443
Will you be my friend?

06:00.827 --> 06:05.287
Promise me that you'll
never cry again.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.796
Never.

06:15.675 --> 06:20.305
Infact, you don't look
good while crying.

06:31.691 --> 06:32.988
Will you make one more promise?

06:36.028 --> 06:36.653
Please.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.998
Will you name my daughter Anjali?

06:45.872 --> 06:46.668
Promise me...

06:51.544 --> 06:56.004
I'm sorry Rahul...
I'm really sorry.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.876
Will you make one more promise?

07:28.080 --> 07:32.039
Will you name my daughter
as 'Anjali'? Promise me.

07:34.353 --> 07:37.220
MUMBAI. - 8 YEARS LATER.

07:39.425 --> 07:42.883
Hi! I'm Anjali & you're
watching Channel Anjali.

07:43.429 --> 07:45.226
I'll become a V.J.
When I grow up.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.225
You know, just like Neelam.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.394
Hey, cut... cut... cut.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.900
Oops, I'll be back after the break.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.065
My hobbies are...

07:54.440 --> 07:55.236
To eat chocolates.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.908
To slap boys.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.076
To cause trouble to my grandmother.

07:58.277 --> 08:01.246
And to read my mom's letters.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.245
Hey, I'm late.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.416
I must get ready.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.244
I've an appointment
with my father.

08:06.452 --> 08:10.411
But, I'll be back next week,
same time, same place. Watch me.

08:11.123 --> 08:13.250
No... no. I don't want
to hear anything.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.586
Please I swear I won't.
- No, I don't want to hear anything.

08:15.795 --> 08:16.762
Please. - No.

08:36.482 --> 08:37.107
Hi!

08:38.150 --> 08:40.778
Anjali, listen to me.
Stop... please stop for a while.

08:40.986 --> 08:46.289
Look, I'm just... 2 hrs. Late.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.453
Right! - Okay, I'm sorry.

08:48.828 --> 08:49.624
But, I was busy.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.296
I'm also busy, papa.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.632
Do you know, I didn't even
watch the T.V. Today.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.461
Because, I was supposed
to meet you here.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.963
And also buy clothes
for you. - Yeah.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.138
This is too much, papa.

09:00.673 --> 09:04.131
I can't do each & everything.
I'm your daughter not your wife.

09:06.846 --> 09:07.312
Why?

09:08.514 --> 09:12.473
When I can be both,
your mom & dad. Then...

09:14.854 --> 09:15.320
Okay.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.822
What's it?
- Did you feel bad?

09:25.531 --> 09:26.327
A bit.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.829
Sorry. - Okay.

09:31.203 --> 09:31.999
Okay.

09:34.206 --> 09:38.506
That's why, I say God is one,
but in different forms.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.842
No matter in which form
he may be,

09:41.213 --> 09:44.512
Our prayers are definitely
reaching him.

09:45.384 --> 09:48.842
So, it's very important to maintain
this bondage with God.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.682
She speaks so well, don't she?

09:52.058 --> 09:53.355
That's all for today.

09:53.559 --> 09:56.357
Mrs. Sharma, you didn't notice my
necklace at all? - In the End...

09:56.896 --> 09:59.262
Do you know, I got this as a gift
on the valentine's day!

09:59.565 --> 10:00.031
Roopa?

10:01.067 --> 10:01.692
Yes.

10:01.901 --> 10:05.530
Roopa will chant
"Gayathri hymn" for us. - Me?

10:06.072 --> 10:06.868
Tell me, Roopa.

10:08.741 --> 10:12.199
I forgot "Gayathri hymn".
- What?

10:12.311 --> 10:14.142
What're you saying, Roopa?

10:14.914 --> 10:15.881
Did you listen to
what she said?

10:16.582 --> 10:18.709
Has Roopa forgot "Gayathri hymn"?

10:19.919 --> 10:22.387
Dear, if you don't concentrate
on prayers,

10:22.588 --> 10:24.215
What'll you teach your children?

10:24.590 --> 10:29.550
What we say & think reflects
on our children, isn't it?

10:30.262 --> 10:32.230
Then, what'll she teach
her children? - Granny...

10:33.933 --> 10:34.900
We were talking about children...

10:35.267 --> 10:37.064
She's my grand daughter,
Anjali. - Greetings.

10:38.437 --> 10:39.904
Hi Sexy!

10:43.109 --> 10:43.905
She has taught her
grand daughter very well.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.078
Who taught you this?

10:46.278 --> 10:47.074
Papa.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.247
Go & get ready for
the school function.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.418
Grandmother, give me the letter.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.417
When is your birthday?
- Tomorrow.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.417
Then...

11:01.961 --> 11:02.928
Go...

11:06.132 --> 11:07.759
Make it fast... make it fast.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.934
Here are our seats. - Sit down.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.104
Mr. Khanna, come... come.
Take your seat.

11:13.305 --> 11:13.930
Greetings. - Greetings.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.607
Hi Makhaiya! Hello... - Hello...

11:16.475 --> 11:17.100
Enough.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.771
Good evening, ladies & gentleman.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.949
And welcome to the
just one minute competition.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.777
It's a strange competition.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.283
Our children have to
blabber on the stage.

11:28.487 --> 11:32.947
And the topics are given
on the spot. - Yes.

11:33.159 --> 11:36.458
On the spot... on the spot...

11:36.662 --> 11:38.129
Stop it Balwir. Control yourself.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.627
Never mind. Let him go ahead.
- Sorry.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.795
But remember, every student will
be given just one minute.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.630
Just one minute.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.974
Just one minute...
Just one minute.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.802
Even I feel the same.
It's really a big problem.

11:51.010 --> 11:54.138
But still, our Jasso
wins every year.

11:54.513 --> 11:55.980
She's very talented, you know?

11:56.182 --> 11:58.150
Best of luck, Jaswinder.
- Same to you.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.649
Our Jaswinder is the best.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.152
Actually Anjali is also taking
part in the competition.

12:04.356 --> 12:05.653
She'll come 2nd.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.325
You don't worry.
- Thank you very much.

12:07.526 --> 12:08.493
Welcome... welcome.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.830
Our 1st contestant is
Jaswinder Singh.

12:12.865 --> 12:19.168
Oh my dear! Come on, speak up.
Jasso... - Jasso.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.668
Come on, do it.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.845
My topic is prayer.

12:28.047 --> 12:31.016
We pray to God every morning.

12:31.217 --> 12:35.517
Father says that God will be
pleased by our prayers.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.689
And he'll protect us. - Wow!

12:38.557 --> 12:42.516
But, mother says that Grandmother
will be pleased.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.697
And will leave huge
property for us.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.702
Prayer(Pooja)

12:51.403 --> 12:53.701
Pooja Bhatt is my favourite actress.

12:53.906 --> 12:56.534
And my friend's name
is also Pooja.

12:56.742 --> 12:57.538
Okay, thank you.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.545
Wow! My dear - So nice.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.873
Next participant is Anjali Khanna.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.052
Pick your topic.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.549
She'll come 2nd. - Okay.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.237
And your time starts now...

13:45.958 --> 13:46.424
Say...

13:50.629 --> 13:51.254
Mother!

14:03.475 --> 14:03.941
Mother!

14:10.983 --> 14:11.779
Mother!

14:21.160 --> 14:21.956
I'm sorry...

14:24.163 --> 14:24.629
Mother!

14:34.340 --> 14:37.969
Mother is the one who loves us
so much that,

14:39.345 --> 14:41.813
Sometimes we don't understand
her love.

14:44.016 --> 14:48.646
Mother is the one who makes us
feel that we are very good,

14:50.356 --> 14:51.823
And there's no one better than us.

14:54.026 --> 14:58.486
Mother is the one whose happiness
lies in our smile.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.826
And is sorrowful when
we're sad.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.497
Mother is the one, without
whom we can't survive.

15:08.540 --> 15:09.006
Mother...

15:10.876 --> 15:11.843
Mother is everything.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.513
But, she is not with us.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.182
But, you've a papa.

15:24.390 --> 15:25.857
And he is very good.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.525
Then, give me a hug.

15:31.563 --> 15:34.031
You're No.1...

15:52.751 --> 15:53.376
Do you know, Rahul?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.047
There is one Mr. Sharma, isn't it?

15:56.255 --> 15:57.051
He called me on phone.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.223
Which Sharma?

15:58.590 --> 15:59.887
Our Delhi neighbour.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.726
He has sent a marriage proposal.

16:01.927 --> 16:02.723
For whom?

16:03.595 --> 16:04.562
For me.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.397
Then, marry.

16:06.765 --> 16:07.561
Shut up.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.236
He was saying, "the girl is
beautiful & well mannered."

16:11.437 --> 16:13.234
I rejected the proposal immediately.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.740
I did the right thing, didn't I?
- Yes.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.740
Did I do the right thing?
- Yes.

16:19.111 --> 16:19.907
Did I do the right thing?

16:23.282 --> 16:24.249
Yes mother.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.585
Yes, may be I did the
right thing then.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.587
By the way, I never do
anything wrong.

16:30.122 --> 16:31.419
I always do the right thing.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.594
Whether the girl is beautiful or
well mannered, it doesn't matter.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.757
Every girl, these days is beautiful
& well mannered.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.096
Who's ready here to marry?

16:42.301 --> 16:43.598
Sharma is also a strange man.

16:43.802 --> 16:45.269
He always phones & troubles me.

16:45.471 --> 16:46.597
Sending marriage proposals.

16:46.972 --> 16:48.940
Why doesn't he get married?
Why is he always bothering me?

16:57.649 --> 16:58.946
What happened, mother?

17:00.652 --> 17:01.778
Don't know, Rahul.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.449
I feel there is a partial
vacuum in our family.

17:06.992 --> 17:07.617
Why?

17:09.494 --> 17:12.953
You're here, I'm here &
Anjali is here.

17:14.665 --> 17:15.963
I don't feel like that.

17:18.002 --> 17:21.461
Do you know, when I go out
with my friends?

17:22.174 --> 17:24.642
They always complain about
their daughters-in-law. -Is it?

17:24.843 --> 17:26.310
But I can't even do that.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.816
This is really a very
big problem!

17:33.185 --> 17:35.153
So, you want a daughter-in-law.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.648
...So that you can also
complain against her.

17:41.693 --> 17:42.489
No son.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.660
I want only happiness for you.

17:48.534 --> 17:49.330
I'm happy.

17:50.869 --> 17:51.665
Very happy.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.001
You'll not marry again.

18:06.218 --> 18:09.676
Mother, we take birth once
and die once.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.356
...And we marry also once in life.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.854
...And we'll fall in
love also only once.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.192
It'll not happen often.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.699
Son, you can manage yourself.

18:27.239 --> 18:28.035
But, Anjali...?

18:30.409 --> 18:30.875
Why?

18:32.744 --> 18:33.369
What happened to her?

18:34.246 --> 18:37.875
Don't you feel she
needs a mother?

18:44.590 --> 18:45.557
She's fine, mother.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.056
...She's fine.

18:54.266 --> 19:00.068
She has with her, which
even I don't have.

19:03.775 --> 19:04.901
Her mother's letters.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.421
Happy birthday Anjali.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.942
My lovely Anjali.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.280
Happy birthday.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.275
Today, you're 8 years old.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.778
And I'm sure, you'll definitely
be like your father.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.121
...Eyes like him. Face like him.

19:50.489 --> 19:51.114
Isn't it, Anjali?

19:51.323 --> 19:53.450
No, I'm like you.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.789
Tell me Anjali, does your father still
sleeps with his shoes on?

19:59.831 --> 20:01.458
When will he quit this habit?

20:03.001 --> 20:04.798
You're a big girl today, Anjali.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.638
The things which I'm going
to tell you today,

20:08.006 --> 20:09.633
You'll understand it clearly.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.640
Today, I'm going to tell
you a story.

20:13.345 --> 20:16.314
This story has me & your father.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.645
...And Anjali.

20:19.518 --> 20:20.314
Anjali!

20:44.376 --> 20:45.001
Late again?

20:46.044 --> 20:47.671
I can't get up early
in the morning.

20:48.213 --> 20:51.011
Can't get up or were you scared?

20:51.383 --> 20:54.841
Rahul Khanna never gets
scared of anyone.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.188
Rahul Khanna never gets
scared of anyone.

20:58.890 --> 21:02.690
But, he always loses to
Anjali Sharma in basket ball.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.697
Don't you want to play?

21:06.732 --> 21:07.699
What's the use?

21:08.066 --> 21:09.363
You lose everyday.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.032
Today, I'll not lose.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.367
You say this everyday.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.040
We'll see.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.040
Shit. We'll see...

21:27.919 --> 21:31.047
Anjali, That's... You can't.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.058
...Can't turn away. Wait... Wait...

21:47.773 --> 21:48.740
Yes.

22:11.963 --> 22:12.429
Come on.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.763
Come on... Come... Come.
Coward, get it.

22:17.469 --> 22:18.936
Come on... Come on... You...

22:19.304 --> 22:20.931
That's... that's cool.

22:21.973 --> 22:25.932
Come... Come... Yes... Yes... Yes...

22:26.978 --> 22:28.275
Oh No!

22:46.998 --> 22:48.124
Yes.

22:53.338 --> 22:54.965
If you can't play, don't
cheat atleast.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.634
Hey, don't call me a cheat.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.971
That's what, you're, a cheat
...a Cheat.

23:01.179 --> 23:02.806
Anjali, don't call me a cheat.

23:03.348 --> 23:09.480
Rahul is a cheat.
- No, I'm not a cheat.

23:12.357 --> 23:12.982
Silly girl.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.152
Don't shout like a girl.

23:16.528 --> 23:17.825
Hey, don't call me a girl.

23:18.029 --> 23:19.997
Actually, you're right,
you're not a girl at all.

23:20.198 --> 23:22.666
Atleast, I'm not like those stupid
girls whom you go mad after.

23:24.369 --> 23:26.997
I don't go after girls.
Girls go after me.

23:28.373 --> 23:29.169
Rahul's here.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.501
Rahul's so cute.
He's so sweet.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.007
How handsome he's, isn't he?

23:33.211 --> 23:35.509
A shade less than you.
Your moustache is little big.

23:36.381 --> 23:37.678
Was it a joke? - It was.

23:38.049 --> 23:41.177
I don't like jokes.
- I don't like you.

23:44.055 --> 23:45.181
Shut up.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.187
Rahul & Anjali had
a fight again.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.862
Rahul & Anjali had
a fight again.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.690
Rahul & Anjali had a fight.

23:54.065 --> 23:55.862
Rahul & Anjali had
a fight again.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.869
What type of a boy is he?

24:01.907 --> 24:04.535
What type of a girl is she?

24:07.412 --> 24:10.040
What am I to do with him?

24:13.251 --> 24:15.549
What am I to tell her?

24:15.754 --> 24:18.382
He fights with me. - Yes.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.058
She's a big snob. - Yes.

24:21.259 --> 24:23.887
He argues. - She gets angry.

24:24.095 --> 24:27.064
He's a madman.
- She's a mad girl.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.901
But, he's your best friend.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.396
But, she's your best friend.

25:17.482 --> 25:20.940
Oh God! This boy.

25:21.486 --> 25:24.944
Ask him why does he behave
like silly boys?

25:33.665 --> 25:36.964
Sometimes he fights and
sometimes argues.

25:37.168 --> 25:40.797
Don't ever come close to him.

25:41.339 --> 25:56.653
This boy is mad.
- Mad... Mad... Mad...

25:56.855 --> 26:00.655
Oh God! This girl.

26:00.859 --> 26:04.317
Ask her why does she behave
like silly girls?

26:04.863 --> 26:08.321
Sometimes she fights &
sometimes behaves like a snob.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.158
Don't anyone ever come
closer to her.

26:12.537 --> 26:28.010
This girl is mad.
- Mad... Mad... Mad...

27:02.420 --> 27:05.719
Only she knows about herself.

27:06.091 --> 27:10.050
No one else knows about her.

27:10.261 --> 27:17.394
How is she? What is she?
No one knows.

27:17.602 --> 27:21.561
Buddies... run from here.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.905
...She might be up
to some mischief.

28:20.999 --> 28:28.462
He always teases me.
He brushes aside all my warnings.

28:28.673 --> 28:35.977
Beware, he's mad.
Stay away from him.

28:36.181 --> 28:43.485
Though he is little mad,
I've accepted him as my friend.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.753
...Coming up is the
Rock Stewart classic.

30:26.958 --> 30:27.754
The first cut is the deepest.

30:31.129 --> 30:34.257
Oh God! This room is in
complete mess.

30:34.465 --> 30:37.093
These girls will make me
go mad. Silly girls.

30:37.302 --> 30:40.760
Hey, what're those little
mounts on your head?

30:40.972 --> 30:42.940
These are rollers, Rifat Bee.

30:43.141 --> 30:45.268
These are rollers, Rifat Bee.

30:45.476 --> 30:49.105
Boys won't fall for these rollers,
take my advice.

30:49.314 --> 30:53.114
Then, what for they'll
fall, Rifat Bee.

30:53.484 --> 30:56.453
Oh God, what a revealing
costume you're wearing?

30:56.654 --> 30:58.281
Feel shy, girl. - Tell me.

30:58.489 --> 31:00.286
I don't know, what for boys
will fall for girls?

31:00.491 --> 31:02.459
Please, tell me. - No.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.624
Tell us.

31:05.830 --> 31:06.626
Okay.

31:07.498 --> 31:11.298
Boys will fall for
girl's grace & style.

31:11.669 --> 31:15.969
They'll go mad over the
shake of their hips. And...

31:16.174 --> 31:17.641
And...?

31:18.810 --> 31:20.675
And... I don't know anything else.

31:21.012 --> 31:22.639
You talk too much.

31:22.847 --> 31:25.645
Why've you spread all your clothes
like they do in a cloth shop? Clear it.

31:26.684 --> 31:28.982
Oh God! What am I to do
with this girl?

31:29.187 --> 31:30.814
Anjali, what's happening here?

31:31.356 --> 31:32.983
What have you worn?

31:33.191 --> 31:35.318
It's cool Rifat Bee. - Cool.

31:35.526 --> 31:38.654
My child, behave like
a girl sometimes.

31:38.863 --> 31:41.491
Not like those mad girls
but little bit.

31:41.699 --> 31:43.496
What's this, Rifat Bee?
Why do you harp on the same thing?

31:43.868 --> 31:46.496
Do you know? I've won against
Rahul again today.

31:46.704 --> 31:50.162
Rahul! Stay away from that bad boy.
- Why?

31:50.375 --> 31:52.172
He's my best friend.
He's my friend.

31:52.377 --> 31:55.175
You never know when this friend
will turn into a lover.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.678
Rahul? Please... Never... Yuck.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.179
Yeah, I know everything.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.011
Come on, have this
pudding stealthily.

32:01.219 --> 32:04.450
Oh! Thank you.
- Oh, leave me... Mad girl.

32:05.056 --> 32:08.025
Hi, St. Xaviers' wishes you
happy Friendship day.

32:12.063 --> 32:12.688
Oh My God!

32:13.398 --> 32:16.026
No short skirts in my
college, please.

32:16.234 --> 32:19.362
Oh, what a beautiful
morning, today.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.197
Good morning Ms. Breganza.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.374
Good morning boys.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.208
Nice colour for you.

32:26.911 --> 32:28.378
I'll complain to your mother,

32:28.579 --> 32:31.707
That you're trying to trap boys
by wearing short skirts.

32:31.916 --> 32:32.712
Excuse me.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.548
I said, no short skirts
in the college, please.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.556
Ms. Breganza.

32:44.429 --> 32:45.555
You were saying something
Mr. Malhotra.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.392
I was just saying...

32:49.767 --> 32:53.066
Wearing short skirts in the college
isn't permitted. - What?

32:53.271 --> 32:55.239
But this is the latest
fashion, Mr. Malhotra.

32:55.606 --> 32:56.573
This is nothing.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.901
Some girls aren't wearing
even skirts.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.738
Don't tell me that Ms. Breganza.

33:01.946 --> 33:03.413
Yes, Mr. Malhotra.

33:07.118 --> 33:08.585
Mr. Malhotra, don't I look
beautiful today?

33:08.786 --> 33:11.755
You're very quite.

33:12.290 --> 33:12.915
Quite?

33:13.624 --> 33:14.420
Cute.

33:15.126 --> 33:16.923
You're very C.U.T.E., aren't you?

33:19.630 --> 33:23.259
If you expose like this
inside the college.

33:23.468 --> 33:24.264
These young boys & girls...

33:24.469 --> 33:26.096
What do you mean by
young boys & girls?

33:26.304 --> 33:27.771
Am I not young?

33:29.474 --> 33:31.442
You're very young.

33:32.977 --> 33:35.445
But Mr. Malhotra you wear
very boring clothes.

33:36.314 --> 33:37.611
I know.

33:38.649 --> 33:39.445
But you know...

33:40.485 --> 33:42.953
Till Mrs. Malhotra was alive. - Yeah.

33:43.154 --> 33:47.614
I used to wear fancy dresses
sometimes, for her. - Really?

33:47.992 --> 33:50.290
They're no more of any use now.

33:50.495 --> 33:52.292
What do you mean,
"Any use now?"

33:54.332 --> 34:05.800
Mr. Malhotra... Ms. Brenganza...
Mrs. Malhotra... Together.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.310
Happy Friendship Day

34:15.018 --> 34:15.643
Aren't you ashamed?

34:15.853 --> 34:16.978
Whenever you meet me why do
you always scare me?

34:17.188 --> 34:18.485
What're you doing?

34:18.688 --> 34:19.985
This is friendship band, sir.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.819
Now, I'm not just your student
I'm your friend too.

34:24.027 --> 34:25.324
Very good.

34:25.696 --> 34:27.994
What's the matter, sir?
You look very happy.

34:28.866 --> 34:29.491
What do you mean?

34:29.867 --> 34:31.835
No... Just like that...
Generally...

34:32.036 --> 34:33.003
Generally.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.001
Generally, my daughter is
coming back, isn't it?

34:35.206 --> 34:35.831
So.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.837
Your daughter?
- Yes, Tina.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.010
She's coming back from London.
- From London?

34:40.210 --> 34:42.338
Yes, she was studying in
Oxford University there.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.674
Oxford University? Wow!

34:45.216 --> 34:46.842
Earlier, we used to
live there only.

34:47.552 --> 34:51.181
But, when I lost my wife
I couldn't stay there anymore.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.357
So, I thought of coming
back to India.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.016
Didn't Tina come with you?

34:55.226 --> 34:57.353
No, Tina wanted to
complete her studies.

34:58.229 --> 35:01.858
But, I yearned to see her.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.198
So, I told her to finish her
last year in my college.

35:05.403 --> 35:09.863
Is our college any inferior
to Oxford University? - Yes sir.

35:10.408 --> 35:11.875
My child, you'll take care of
my daughter Tina, won't you?

35:12.076 --> 35:12.872
Off course, sir.

35:13.077 --> 35:15.375
Happy "Friendship Day."
- Thank you, sir.

35:15.746 --> 35:16.542
Good.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.874
Rahul? Unbelievable.

35:19.083 --> 35:22.883
You know, I'm the first girl to get
a friendship band from Rahul.

35:23.087 --> 35:23.883
Wow!

35:24.088 --> 35:24.884
Isn't it exciting?

35:25.089 --> 35:26.056
Of course.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.386
You know Sonia. - Yes.

35:30.595 --> 35:33.393
You're the only one to whom I'm
giving this friendship band.

35:33.764 --> 35:35.561
Really Rahul?
- Really Sonia.

35:35.933 --> 35:39.562
You're different from others.
You're the most beautiful girl here.

35:39.770 --> 35:40.737
Really Rahul?

35:40.938 --> 35:41.905
Really Sonia.

35:42.773 --> 35:45.901
Oh Rahul! Are you telling
me the truth?

35:46.777 --> 35:47.243
Really Tania.

35:47.445 --> 35:48.571
My name is Sonia.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.577
Yes,

35:51.115 --> 35:51.581
Did you see?

35:52.617 --> 35:55.085
I was so lost in your thoughts
that I forgot your name also.

35:55.286 --> 35:58.084
I just can't believe it, Rahul.
- Trust me.

35:58.623 --> 36:02.923
Oh Rahul... - Oh Sonia.

36:03.127 --> 36:04.094
Stop it, Rahul.

36:13.304 --> 36:14.430
Oh Sonia.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.107
Oh Rahul.

36:21.312 --> 36:22.108
It fell down.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.947
Not mine. - Cheat, - No... No...

36:24.315 --> 36:27.944
You liar. - Hey, come on.

36:28.653 --> 36:31.622
Oh! No... No... Tania,
what's your name?

36:31.822 --> 36:32.618
Sonia.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.120
Go away.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.292
You spoiled my half
an hour's effort.

36:36.994 --> 36:39.792
Don't you get tired of running
after these stupid girls?

36:39.997 --> 36:42.966
Hey, I don't run after girls
- I know it... I know it...

36:43.501 --> 36:45.469
Can't you find one girl
for yourself?

36:45.836 --> 36:48.805
One who's beautiful and
little intelligent too.

36:49.006 --> 36:53.136
Good! One who's beautiful and
little intelligent too.

36:55.179 --> 36:56.203
Where can I find such a girl?

37:01.519 --> 37:03.987
By the way, I just pass time
with these girls.

37:04.522 --> 37:05.648
Because, I'm yet to
find my girl?

37:05.856 --> 37:06.322
Your girl?

37:07.858 --> 37:08.324
My girl.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.832
Because, I've not yet
found a girl.

37:16.033 --> 37:18.331
Who can make something happen
on seeing her.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.100
What will happen?

37:21.105 --> 37:22.003
Something happens in the heart.

37:23.207 --> 37:23.832
What will happen?

37:29.046 --> 37:30.013
Something happens.

37:31.983 --> 37:32.950
You'll never understand.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.515
When she walks, the world will
stand still to watch her.

37:46.564 --> 37:49.533
And when she stops
time will also stop.

37:54.238 --> 37:55.205
And when she laughs.

37:55.906 --> 37:56.873
She... she...

37:57.842 --> 37:58.934
What would you do when
you find her?

38:00.411 --> 38:01.537
What would I do, if I find her?

38:01.912 --> 38:02.537
Yes.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.043
Bowing before her.

38:07.918 --> 38:09.215
Spreading out my hands.

38:09.587 --> 38:10.110
I would say.

38:10.855 --> 38:14.313
...Whoever you might be
I love you.

38:28.606 --> 38:29.163
I love you.

38:29.373 --> 38:30.067
Sorry.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.573
Don't be! I love you.

38:33.377 --> 38:35.572
Excuse me.
- No... No... Squeeze me.

38:44.021 --> 38:48.822
Hi, I'm Anjali. - Hi....And you're?
- Hi! I'm Rahul. - Hi... Hi...

38:49.026 --> 38:50.118
Tina, right? - Yeah.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.592
How do you know her? - This morning
principal had... - Right.

38:52.797 --> 38:55.425
Don't utter that eccentric
old man's name early morning.

38:55.633 --> 38:58.101
So, today's your first day
in the college.

38:58.803 --> 38:59.929
Just now she has come
from London. - Yeah.

39:00.137 --> 39:01.104
How do you know that?

39:01.305 --> 39:02.932
Because Rahul, this morning
Principal had...

39:03.140 --> 39:05.199
Didn't I tell you not to utter
that old bald man's name? Okay?

39:05.409 --> 39:06.433
Bald. - So, Tina.

39:07.311 --> 39:09.609
Where were you studying in London?
- In Oxford University.

39:09.814 --> 39:13.443
Oh Oxford! - How do you know? - Because,
this morning principal had told me.

39:13.651 --> 39:16.779
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...
Please, let that bald man wait.

39:16.987 --> 39:18.181
He's our useless principal.

39:18.589 --> 39:19.351
And she's his stooge.

39:19.824 --> 39:20.290
Useless?

39:20.491 --> 39:22.118
Useless! You're, right
but, forget him.

39:22.593 --> 39:23.116
Tell me.

39:23.327 --> 39:25.454
How do you find your first day
in this college? - Great.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.528
Good morning. All of you go
to your classes.

39:27.732 --> 39:28.528
Good morning Archana.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.462
Feroze! Cut your hair.
- Jealous?

39:32.670 --> 39:34.297
No, of course not, Oh my god!

39:34.505 --> 39:36.632
He's that useless principal,
good morning sir.

39:37.341 --> 39:37.807
Good Morning.

39:38.008 --> 39:40.977
Hi sir. - Good morning sir.
- Good morning darling.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.306
Don't you know, wearing short skirts
is banned in this college?

39:44.515 --> 39:46.142
You know, I've come from
London yesterday only.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.476
And I haven't unpacked my baggage.

39:47.685 --> 39:48.310
Excuse me! But,

39:49.019 --> 39:50.145
Sir may I... - No.

39:50.354 --> 39:50.820
Thank you.

39:51.021 --> 39:53.489
But. - Look, today's Tina's
first day in college.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.488
She has come London yesterday only.
She didn't get time to unpack her baggage.

39:55.693 --> 39:56.990
She wore whatever she could
lay her hands on.

39:57.194 --> 39:58.320
How do you know that?

39:58.529 --> 40:00.497
Sir, I know Tina since Childhood.
- From childhood? - Right sir.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.325
Really? - Really father.

40:02.533 --> 40:03.329
Really father.

40:04.368 --> 40:05.665
Father? - Father.

40:07.204 --> 40:08.501
Father.! - Father... Father...

40:09.707 --> 40:11.834
Mr. Malhotra, I need your help.

40:12.042 --> 40:13.168
Not here sir, she's waiting for
you in the staff room.

40:13.377 --> 40:14.002
In the staff room!

40:14.712 --> 40:17.010
Yeah! We've an important meeting
about your future.

40:17.214 --> 40:19.682
You take care, sir.
- Bye... Bye... Bye...

40:20.384 --> 40:21.180
Shit.

40:21.719 --> 40:22.686
Excuse me.

40:23.554 --> 40:24.020
Yeah.

40:25.389 --> 40:28.517
He's old, eccentric and bald.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.788
And... - Very smart.

40:31.395 --> 40:32.794
Sweet! He's Sweet too.

40:33.063 --> 40:33.688
...And he's useless.

40:34.231 --> 40:36.699
But, he isn't that bad.

40:38.235 --> 40:39.031
Squeeze me.

40:39.737 --> 40:40.362
Yes.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.139
Happy Friendship Day.

40:45.743 --> 40:48.712
We met just now.
Friendship is long way off.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.150
Oh shit!

40:58.255 --> 41:00.746
Hey, did something happen to you?
- No.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.059
She's not my type of girl.
- Why?

41:03.594 --> 41:04.720
She's not an Indian, is she?

41:05.262 --> 41:08.891
She studied and grew up in London and
Londoners are quite different.

41:09.266 --> 41:12.394
A girl should make you feel like
taking her to your mother.

41:12.603 --> 41:16.733
...You know. No... She's not my type.

41:16.941 --> 41:19.409
No, she's not my type.

41:19.777 --> 41:21.301
You'll never get a girl if you
behave like this. Got it?

41:21.779 --> 41:22.245
Why not?

41:23.280 --> 41:24.747
You're there. - Me?

41:24.949 --> 41:26.075
Yuck? - Please friend.

41:26.283 --> 41:27.910
If I don't find any other girl
I'll marry you.

41:28.118 --> 41:29.745
Absolutely no. - Anjali, anyway no one
will come forward to marry you.

41:29.954 --> 41:31.251
Just, shut up.

41:31.455 --> 41:31.921
Hey wait... Wait.

41:32.122 --> 41:32.747
Let me go to the class.

41:40.631 --> 41:42.098
Babe.

41:50.140 --> 41:50.765
Here.

41:51.475 --> 41:51.941
Take this.

41:52.643 --> 41:53.109
What's this?

41:53.310 --> 41:55.278
This is our college's sweat shirt
...Look me.

41:55.646 --> 41:56.203
Thanks.

41:57.481 --> 41:58.948
Yeah. - Can I ask you something?

41:59.149 --> 41:59.774
Yeah sure.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.954
Why is everyone staring at me?

42:05.489 --> 42:08.458
Why boys stare at you
...You know that.

42:09.159 --> 42:11.457
And girls want to know
why boys are staring at you?

42:11.662 --> 42:13.459
So, they're also staring at you.
Yeah?

42:14.832 --> 42:16.129
Yeah.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.469
Look, if you've any problem
come straight to me.

42:19.670 --> 42:20.967
Or else go to Rahul
you know him, don't you?

42:21.171 --> 42:23.639
Rahul is the one whom I met yesterday.
He's my best friend.

42:23.841 --> 42:27.140
We've good influence in this college.
You know that type.

42:29.346 --> 42:30.472
Hi guys.

42:32.349 --> 42:33.976
This is Rahul. See.

42:35.519 --> 42:37.146
Hi... Hi...

42:38.355 --> 42:39.652
There's a rule in our college.

42:40.190 --> 42:43.990
We make every fresher to sing a song.
You know? Do-Re-Mi.

42:44.194 --> 42:45.991
Right? - Right.

42:46.363 --> 42:48.490
Rahul, she's principal's daughter.

42:48.866 --> 42:51.994
So what? We can't break our rules
for anyone, can we?

42:52.202 --> 42:53.169
Right.

42:53.370 --> 42:55.497
But Rahul. - Shut up,
principal's side kick.

43:03.547 --> 43:07.347
London... Oxford University
you know.

43:07.885 --> 43:13.016
You sing a song in Hindi
for us & the entire college.

43:13.223 --> 43:13.848
Hindi?

43:14.224 --> 43:15.418
I'm really sorry.

43:16.393 --> 43:19.021
What? Have you forgot Hindi
after going to London?

43:19.563 --> 43:20.689
Sorry! One minute... One minute.

43:20.898 --> 43:21.364
Excuse me.

43:22.066 --> 43:23.533
Rahul, how can she sing
a song in Hindi?

43:23.734 --> 43:25.702
Is it because she's
principal's daughter?

43:26.403 --> 43:27.700
If he can't teach her,
how can he teach us?

43:27.905 --> 43:30.032
And you... shut up.

43:31.241 --> 43:32.538
So, Tina, what was I saying?

43:33.577 --> 43:37.707
You'll sing a song in Hindi and
that too immediately.

43:38.248 --> 43:40.716
Normally, we don't have that
much free time, do we?

43:40.918 --> 43:41.885
Right?

43:42.086 --> 43:44.213
Okay. Go on.

44:11.281 --> 44:26.424
Hail Lord Jagadish.

44:46.316 --> 44:51.447
Perils of devotees,

44:51.989 --> 44:55.652
Perils of your servitors,

44:57.161 --> 45:01.791
Will be dispelled by you in seconds.

45:02.666 --> 45:24.181
Hail Lord Jagadish.

45:39.703 --> 45:42.501
By growing up in London or
studying there,

45:43.040 --> 45:44.837
I haven't forgotten our traditions.

45:46.376 --> 45:47.673
And you also don't forget them.

46:05.062 --> 46:06.359
Yeah... Yeah...

46:06.563 --> 46:09.361
Okay, catch it.
Okay... Yeah... Sure.

46:10.067 --> 46:11.364
Oh God!

46:36.927 --> 46:38.554
Hey, you've occupied my place.

46:38.762 --> 46:40.229
Oh! I'm sorry. - It's okay.

46:40.430 --> 46:41.226
Hey, Adi... move.

46:44.434 --> 46:45.901
Morning class. Good morning.

46:46.103 --> 46:47.968
Good morning Madan.
- Settle down everyone.

46:57.447 --> 46:57.970
Any way...

46:58.448 --> 47:00.313
Today, we're going to
start a new lesson.

47:04.955 --> 47:06.923
An eternal love story.

47:07.457 --> 47:09.254
The eternal love story.

47:09.459 --> 47:12.758
Before I start, I've to
ask all of you something.

47:13.463 --> 47:16.091
What do you know about love?

47:16.967 --> 47:19.435
What do you know of love?

47:19.970 --> 47:20.937
What's love?

47:21.471 --> 47:24.872
Any one... any one... any one.
No one?

47:28.145 --> 47:30.943
You tell me, what's love? - Me?

47:31.815 --> 47:32.782
I don't know.

47:34.151 --> 47:36.449
Anjali, what're you doing?

47:36.653 --> 47:38.951
You tell me, what's love?

47:40.157 --> 47:40.782
Love...

47:45.162 --> 47:46.288
Forget it.

47:47.331 --> 47:49.231
Anyone else...

47:54.171 --> 47:55.297
What's love?

47:57.507 --> 47:57.973
Love?

48:00.510 --> 48:01.477
Love is friendship.

48:05.182 --> 48:09.983
If she can't become my friend,
I can never fall in love with her.

48:10.854 --> 48:12.583
Because, there's no love
without friendship.

48:14.024 --> 48:16.049
Simple! Love is friendship.

48:17.194 --> 48:18.161
Okay, Ms. Breganza.

48:18.695 --> 48:19.821
Okay, Rahul.

48:20.530 --> 48:22.395
What an absolutely
delightful thought.

48:23.200 --> 48:27.660
Love is friendship.

48:27.871 --> 48:30.669
Did you hear that class?
Thank you Rahul.

48:30.874 --> 48:34.173
Thanks for sharing this absolutely
delightful idea with us.

48:34.711 --> 48:39.011
Love is a friendship.

48:42.886 --> 48:43.409
So...

48:46.556 --> 48:47.523
Would you like to become my friend?

48:53.563 --> 48:54.359
Okay.

49:10.580 --> 49:13.208
Something happens...

49:15.919 --> 49:17.978
Happens...

49:22.592 --> 49:23.889
My head... my legs.

49:24.428 --> 49:25.053
I was sleeping upside down.

49:26.430 --> 49:26.896
Hello.

49:27.764 --> 49:29.891
Sorry Mr. Malhotra, Breganza here.

49:32.936 --> 49:33.903
Yes, Ms. Breganza.

49:34.271 --> 49:35.670
I didn't disturb you, did I?

49:35.939 --> 49:38.567
I'm sure, even if I had disturbed
you won't mind.

49:42.446 --> 49:43.572
Go ahead Ms. Breganza.

49:43.780 --> 49:45.748
Anyway, I called to tell you,

49:45.949 --> 49:47.416
That we've finished all
our rehearsals.

49:47.617 --> 49:51.576
Our college will be the best
in tomorrow's competition.

49:51.955 --> 49:53.923
Students from other colleges
would be spellbound.

49:54.124 --> 49:55.250
You know, what I mean.

49:55.959 --> 49:58.427
You're responsible for all
that, Ms. Breganza.

49:58.962 --> 50:01.089
And I've done it for you,
Mr. Malhotra.

50:02.132 --> 50:03.429
Really, Ms. Breganza?

50:04.468 --> 50:05.765
Really Malhotra.

50:12.642 --> 50:13.370
I fell down.

50:14.311 --> 50:19.772
And our college is...
Our college... St. Xaviers.

50:34.331 --> 50:34.797
What?

50:35.332 --> 50:37.459
Oh My God! Can't he come here?

50:37.667 --> 50:39.965
Ms. Breganza, his neighbourhood
is under curfew.

50:40.170 --> 50:41.467
It's very difficult to
come out from there.

50:41.671 --> 50:42.968
Good God! What's going
to happen now?

50:43.173 --> 50:45.801
We want Xaviers.

50:46.009 --> 50:49.467
Listen Mr. Malhotra. Let me think...
please... - Okay.

50:52.182 --> 50:53.308
Idea! - Idea?

50:54.351 --> 50:54.976
Yes.

50:55.352 --> 50:55.977
No.

50:56.686 --> 50:59.814
You must do it. Otherwise,
I'll mark you all as failed.

51:01.191 --> 51:02.988
But sir, how can we sing and
dance on the stage?

51:03.193 --> 51:04.319
We don't know anything.

51:04.528 --> 51:05.495
And you know about our students.

51:05.695 --> 51:06.992
They'll not spare as alive.
- Correct.

51:07.364 --> 51:08.331
It's a bad idea. - Right.

51:08.532 --> 51:10.830
Rahul, it's not a bad idea,
of course, it's a good idea.

51:11.034 --> 51:12.331
You'll not face any wrath.

51:12.702 --> 51:14.169
The students who should've
performed here.

51:14.371 --> 51:16.498
They had recorded their programme
on a tape. - For rehearsal.

51:16.706 --> 51:18.003
I'll play the tape recorder.

51:18.208 --> 51:20.005
A beautiful song will be
heard from it.

51:20.210 --> 51:22.838
You must learn the lyrics and
only give lip movement for them.

51:23.713 --> 51:26.181
Just like in movies.
Lip sync. Okay.

51:27.217 --> 51:27.911
It won't work.

51:28.552 --> 51:30.520
Why will it not work?
Off course it'll work.

51:31.221 --> 51:34.019
My name is Chinchuchoo...

51:34.224 --> 51:37.193
A moonlit night, you & me alone.

51:41.398 --> 51:43.696
Ms. Breganza control yourself.
- Control.

51:46.570 --> 51:47.537
No.

51:50.407 --> 51:51.704
What do you mean by no?

51:52.576 --> 51:53.372
Anjali, you too?

51:54.077 --> 51:56.204
Aren't you concerned about
your college's honour?

51:56.413 --> 51:59.610
I know. - That's very tragic!
Very tragic.

52:03.753 --> 52:04.617
Come on, Rahul.

52:05.088 --> 52:06.885
This is a matter of our
college's honour.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.557
Okay. - Okay.
Come in Mr. Malhotra.

52:12.762 --> 52:14.389
Okay! Come on Tina,
you too join us, come on.

52:14.598 --> 52:16.225
No... no. I'm not joining you.

52:16.433 --> 52:18.060
What're you saying?

52:19.436 --> 52:21.404
Why're you asking her?
Let's go.

52:33.950 --> 52:35.747
One & only Rahul.

52:40.457 --> 52:41.583
We'll get to the top.

52:42.125 --> 52:42.591
Play.

52:42.792 --> 52:44.589
What do I play?
May be this song only.

52:44.794 --> 52:52.997
You're a foreigner.

52:53.470 --> 52:57.668
How can you be my companion?

53:03.813 --> 53:04.939
Mr. Malhotra, what's this?

53:05.148 --> 53:07.776
Ms. Breganza, I made a mistake.
I played the wrong tape.

53:09.319 --> 53:11.014
Hey, what the hell is happening?

53:13.490 --> 53:14.616
Go...

53:14.991 --> 53:15.787
Okay... Okay...

53:22.332 --> 53:23.560
Switch off the Music.

54:14.384 --> 54:17.512
I've found someone.

54:18.888 --> 54:21.857
I've found someone.

54:23.560 --> 54:27.189
I've found someone.

54:56.593 --> 54:59.562
What happened to me?

55:00.096 --> 55:02.997
Why I've lost myself?

55:03.767 --> 55:10.331
Was I mad earlier or
now I've gone mad?

55:10.774 --> 55:14.073
Your eyes are startled,
your hairs are tousled.

55:14.277 --> 55:17.405
What've you done to yourself?

55:17.614 --> 55:20.583
I've found someone.

55:20.784 --> 55:24.584
I've lost my heart.

55:24.788 --> 55:27.757
What am I to tell you friends?

55:27.957 --> 55:31.415
I'm shaken.

55:31.628 --> 55:33.493
I've found someone.

55:34.631 --> 55:41.764
Really, I've found someone.

57:21.571 --> 57:24.870
Don't know what has happened to me?

57:25.074 --> 57:28.373
People are calling me, mad.

57:28.578 --> 57:32.207
Tell me, what's this madness?

57:32.415 --> 57:35.043
What has happened to you?

57:35.251 --> 57:38.880
Till yesterday, I was conscious
of everything.

57:39.088 --> 57:42.546
There was excitement of
happiness in my heart.

57:42.759 --> 57:46.388
Why're you restless and perplexed?

57:46.596 --> 57:49.565
Have you lost everything?

58:53.329 --> 58:56.628
Have you lost it like
a vanishing cloud?

58:56.833 --> 59:00.132
Who's that who has
besieged your heart?

59:00.503 --> 59:02.095
I would like to reveal the name
of the one I like.

59:02.305 --> 59:06.969
Yet, I'm not able to
tell her name.

59:07.310 --> 59:10.711
Don't call out her name
but do tell something.

59:10.914 --> 59:14.247
...A slight hint atleast.

59:14.450 --> 59:18.147
She's in my eyes.
She's in my breath.

59:18.354 --> 59:21.323
What else can I tell you?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.384
Anjali, what happened?

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:44.998
Don't know why I'm yearning
to see mother today.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:48.568
How can you say that when I'm here?

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:59.509
Mad girl, crying will not
solve anything... anything.

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:08.079
Yes, good timing guys.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.527
Hi... Hi...

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.989
Rahul, juice.

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:17.832
Rahul, juice.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.772
Hey, look at her.

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:30.468
Anjali, since when do you
know Rahul?

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:32.173
From day one at college.

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.313
Do you know, what I did?

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.540
I won over him in fist strength.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.343
From then, we're best friends.

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:38.012
Best friends.

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.285
Rahul is your best friend, isn't he?

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.887
No, I'm Rahul's best friend.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.562
Rahul, juice... juice...

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.197
Don't you love him?

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:58.432
Hi.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:00.868
Shall I go? - Where?

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:05.041
Today it's Tuesday, isn't it?

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:08.581
Yes, Rahul goes to meet his
relatives every Tuesday.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:09.251
Yes.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.716
But if you say, I'll not go.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.616
No, Rahul you go ahead.
- No, I've some more time.

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.347
Go Rahul, you'll get late.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:16.081
Go... go... come on, go
- I... I can stay.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.520
Come on... Go... - okay... Okay...

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:18.386
Bye.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.906
Oh God! It would be better,
if I don't fail this time also.

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:38.944
I'm little weak in Chemistry.
Take care of it.

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:39.773
Okay.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:44.814
Hi...

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.762
Hey, look infront of you.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.529
Rahul... Rahul...

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:06.071
Hi... Hi... Hi...

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:07.538
How are you?

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.209
So, your relatives live here.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:13.505
Yes here... not here... Here...
...not here... here...

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:19.386
So, Rahul Khanna visits temple
every Tuesday. - Oh! Shit man.

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:20.346
Yeah!

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:21.750
How sweet!

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.925
Why did you lie in college?

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:28.760
Generally boys don't visit
temple... That's why.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.796
But, you do come. - Yes...

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.695
Do you come every week?
- Yeah.

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:33.994
How sweet!

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:35.465
Look, don't call me sweet.

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.765
Actually, my dad used to say, "don't tell
this to anyone in the college."

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:39.907
This...? - Not this one.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.702
A man's head bows before
3 women only.

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:44.743
One before mummy...
That's his mother.

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.744
One before Goddess Durga.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:47.846
...And...

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.182
And?

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:52.983
And...

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:08.194
Come on, wear it.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.199
What do you say?
Cool... you'll look cool.

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:14.205
I was just trying it out.
Don't know how others wear all this.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.937
You won't lose anything if you
behave like normal girl.

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.509
Take this, letter from your mother.

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:21.774
You were yearning to see her,
weren't you?

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:23.013
Listen.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.386
And take this also.
- What's this?

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.520
Present.

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.630
Rahul, you here?
At this hour?

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.310
Actually, I couldn't sleep, so I thought
you'll also be sleepless.

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.275
And if you're not sleeping then,
you'll be thinking about me only.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.640
So, I've come to you.
- What?

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:54.645
By the way, which do you like
most flowers or chocolates?

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:55.475
What?

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.548
I didn't bring anything
I was just asking.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.082
Just kidding.

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:03.725
Thank you.

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:05.757
By the way, I do have chocolates.

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:11.989
Don't you feel it's too hot here.
Though, I'm okay.

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.697
I'm cool.

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:15.570
Come in.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:16.965
If you insist.

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.265
If you insist.

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.233
May I? - Yeah, off course.

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:22.468
Thank you.

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.405
Nice bed.

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:26.842
Why're you standing?
Please come & sit.

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.983
Come... Come... - Thanks.

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:39.718
Oh! This's the story in which the servant
would've killed wife & husband.

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.065
Thanks. Anytime.
You're reading such a fat book.

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:44.095
You... could've asked me.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.324
Yes, this's that book only.
I've already read it.

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:48.469
Rahul, you haven't finished your story.
- Very interesting.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.467
No, there's nothing special.

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:51.503
Husband & wife go on a
two months vacation.

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:52.503
So, they engage a servant at home.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:53.675
Later, they come to know that
the servant is a psychopath.

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.468
Not this story.
- If not this, then...

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:57.106
Temple story.

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.540
Temple? What temple?
I don't know any temple.

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:00.716
Yeah? - Yeah.

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.076
Right. - Right.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:03.750
The same story.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.421
A man's head bows
before only 3 women.

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:10.490
Before his mother, before Goddess Durga.
- Is it?

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.057
And... - And?

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:13.892
And... - And?

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.364
Father. - Useless.

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:20.125
Shut up.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:22.095
Rahul, father is coming here.
- Congratulations.

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:23.669
Shut up Rahul! Go away from here.
- Okay, Bye... bye...

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:24.840
Not from that side.
Rahul, go from this side.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:25.905
My ladder is there.
- There's no way from here.

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:27.370
And I haven't finished my story.
- You go out first.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.305
A man's head bows before 3 women only.
- I don't want to hear anything.

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:30.843
Before mother, before Goddess Durga.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.140
And... And... And...

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:53.226
And...

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:17.624
I'll climb over the ladder.
...And he'll get caught.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.124
What? - Torch.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:19.850
Throw up.

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.154
Okay... - Good.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.068
Who beat me now?

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.198
I'll become a ghost.

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.229
If any ghost comes here,
it'll get scared of me.

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.301
Where has the ladder vanished?

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:35.805
Ladder.

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:37.970
Ladder.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:46.421
Why're you entering your
own home like a thief?

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.383
Why're you giggling?

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:57.421
What have done this, Rahul?

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:59.624
I was coming to meet you only.
- Why?

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:00.392
That's... I want.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.895
Anjali look, a falling star.
- Where?

01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:05.163
Not below, up there.

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:07.264
Do you know?

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:08.966
They say if you make a wish
seeing a falling star.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.076
Your wish will be fulfilled.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:13.604
Do you believe it?
- Let's try it.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:14.747
Okay, make a wish.

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:26.043
You came near me.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.189
And smiled at me.

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:44.838
You don't know how many dreams
you had inspired in me.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:11:00.448
Now, my heart neither
wakes up nor sleeps.

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:10.964
What am I to do?
Something is happening.

01:11:57.813 --> 01:12:02.841
Don't know what's this
new experience.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:08.080
What's this never ending thirst?

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:13.751
Oh Dear! What's this magical
effect of love on me.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.361
...It is overwhelming me.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:21.764
No body knows why any one
loses his comfort.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:13.278
What a great effect
my prayers had created.

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:18.893
Don't know, how I fell in love.

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:26.829
Don't know, why I'm feeling
comfort in discomfort.

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:32.337
In my Ioneliness, your memories
are my companion.

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:35.168
Good morning, - Good morning.

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:38.269
Hi.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.235
Servant committed the murder.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.776
Oh God! Look there.

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:49.413
What is she wearing?

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:55.455
Hi guys. - Hi.

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:57.223
How do I look?

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.523
Am I not just like Tina? See.

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:02.856
My foot.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.301
Oh God! She seems like cracked up.
Stop it Rahul... - I can't. Come on, tell me.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:18.440
Sorry.

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.018
Stop it, Rahul.

01:15:26.588 --> 01:15:28.715
She's looking funny.

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.351
Shut up, Rahul. - No... No...

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:55.507
What?

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:57.475
Gone?

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.154
I'm mad, ain't I?

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.556
I want to be beautiful like you.

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.391
But, I don't know anything.

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:15.662
Anjali, you're beautiful.
Very beautiful.

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:17.632
You're lying.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.235
Didn't you see how they were
laughing at me?

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:22.540
Oh! They're...
- They're idiots like me.

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:25.570
Actually, you're very beautiful.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.742
Because, you're different
from all other girls.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:32.144
At least you're not like other stupid
girls
after whom I go.

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:34.580
Do you know?

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:37.953
If you wish, you can get any boy.

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:39.389
Any?

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:41.257
Any.

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:43.127
Any?

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:45.529
Any.

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.198
Just, he must have poor eyesight.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:55.776
Okay, tell me where did you
find this lip stick?

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:58.776
Isn't there a Babli in my class,
she gave it to me.

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:00.713
Stupid, Idiot.

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.315
I'll beat her.

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:24.564
Love is madness...
Intoxicating too.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:30.970
It'll be different from
any happiness or sorrow.

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:32.009
Father.

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:34.440
Father.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.514
What father?

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.249
You can't hide anything from me.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.312
But, Rahul?

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:42.915
Didn't you find any other?

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.251
Come on, father.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:48.429
Actually, if it had been anyone
else in Rahul's place.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.265
Even then, may be I would feel
just the same.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.266
Why?

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:55.831
Your love gets divided, isn't it?
That's why.

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:01.631
I love you, father.

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:04.775
That's the problem.
I love you too.

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:09.476
Did you tell him about
your feelings?

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.324
Don't know, why I feel like this.

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:23.956
...Anjali also loves Rahul.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:27.966
I know Rahul loves only you.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:32.164
And Anjali is just his good friend.
That's all.

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:34.169
No, father.

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.810
Behind the facade of this
deep friendship.

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.147
Love is hiding somewhere
in a corner.

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:41.141
And I don't want to...

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:43.651
The friendship which
could turn into love.

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:45.483
I don't want to come between
their friendship.

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:50.354
Entire college knows.
Rahul & Anjali are best friends.

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:51.651
And nothing else.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.989
Go... go & tell him that
you love him deeply.

01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:01.601
But, I don't know whether
he loves me or not.

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:04.169
Never keep your heart's
feelings to yourself.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.670
Go... and tell him.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.026
I...

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.024
I love you.

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:31.365
I love you.

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:36.362
Shit.

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:40.037
I never imagined I'll ever say
these words to someone.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:43.210
But I... I really love you.

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:46.873
Shit.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.210
I... I hope.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:51.912
I could say all this to her.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.884
You know, how many times I had
decided to say this to her.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.819
But, every time, I go to her.

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.719
When I start to say this...
...That's all... I.

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:01.490
...I think, I'll tell her.

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:04.232
Sometimes with her.
- With whom?

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:06.400
With Tina, who else?

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:09.066
We'll do it again.

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.598
I'm Rahul & you're Tina... Okay.

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:14.403
Hey, look up... up.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:16.410
I...

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:27.079
I love you.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:34.089
I love you too.

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:39.600
She'll say this, won't she?

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:43.931
Love. - Yeah.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:44.764
Come here.

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:51.773
Shall I tell her?

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:54.948
Yes.

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:55.942
Right now?

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:00.454
Okay.

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:31.451
God, never make anyone writhe
in the pain of love.

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:51.297
Heart's feelings get buried in the heart
and never come up on the lips.

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:27.535
Rifat Bee, my first love
remains unsaid.

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:45.225
I love you.

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:52.725
You don't remember me, what's use
in telling it to anyone?

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:04.745
My heart cried and eyes
filled with tears.

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:08.541
What's use of telling
it to anyone?

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:43.116
Mother.

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:58.961
I gave all my happiness to you.

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:04.972
I gave my smile to you.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:13.477
Dark clouds of her hair waved.
Bringing a message of love.

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:19.181
You kept your love perfectly.

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:23.016
What's the use of telling
it to anyone now?

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:37.430
Excuse me... Sorry.

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:40.340
Sorry madam.

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.171
Rahul, you check in the front.
- Yes.

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:44.504
I'll check that side
- Yes... check...

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:54.521
One minute.

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:57.215
Where're you going?

01:24:58.326 --> 01:24:59.190
Back to home. - What?

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:03.759
Mother has written a letter.
Father isn't keeping good health.

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:06.023
And I have so much work
at home.

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:06.791
You've gone mad.

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.202
You're going away on
receiving a letter.

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:09.028
You're not going anywhere.
Come.

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:10.261
Rahul, I must go.

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.699
How can you leave a
term mid-way? Come.

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:15.542
Rahul, please try to understood.
- Finish your final exams & then go.

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:17.870
But, Rahul it's... - Go after
finishing your final exams.

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.706
Rahul please.
- Go after final exams.

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.882
May be I'll not come back
even for the final term.

01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:29.048
I'm not coming back, Rahul.

01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:34.892
Oh! Then, you're leaving college.

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:37.090
You're leaving me.

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:41.394
And didn't even inform me.

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:44.404
Okay.

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:48.737
I don't want to know.

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:50.903
Rahul, I'm going away. -
Go away.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.406
Rahul, I'm going. - Go...

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:56.076
Rahul, I'm not coming back.
- I don't care, okay.

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:49.795
Shit.

01:26:58.179 --> 01:26:59.146
Anjali, please don't go.

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:00.981
With whom will I play
basket ball?

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:02.642
You used to lose every time.

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.477
Then, why're you going?

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:06.653
Mother needs me, Rahul.

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:07.815
Don't I need you?

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:11.488
Now trouble Tina,
I've had enough of it.

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:13.160
I'll fail.

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:14.324
Then, fail.

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:18.161
Atleast, now stop chasing
those stupid girls.

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.168
But I'll miss you, friend.

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.177
I'll miss you too.

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:13.653
That day, I felt may be I had
come between Rahul & Anjali.

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:17.050
May be I had come between
two friends.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.558
Anjali's silence told me
everything loudly.

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:25.896
And I'm confident that she loved
your father very much.

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:29.561
So much love, that even I couldn't
love your father.

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:32.902
Neither there was a phone call
nor a letter from Anjali.

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.402
She went away from our lives.

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.744
...Forever.

01:28:38.613 --> 01:28:41.741
Your father used to say,
Love is friendship.

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:44.308
Yes, I could become
his friend.

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:47.580
But, I could never become
his best friend.

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:51.349
Dear, I know your
father very well.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:52.857
He's Ionely.

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.761
But, he'll never say anything.

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:59.259
His life lacks a friend.
...Lacks a love.

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:02.762
And that friend is Anjali, dear.
And that love is Anjali.

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:07.608
Dear, bring back Anjali
into your father's life.

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:11.870
Return Anjali's first love to her.

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:15.680
Anjali & Rahul are made
for each other.

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:19.946
This is truth.
And this is my dream.

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.798
Will you make your mother's
dream come true?

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:36.133
Bring back Anjali into Rahul's life.

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:39.472
Bring back Anjali into
your father's life.

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:44.370
Make my dream come true, dear.

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:10.961
Happy birthday dear.
Sorry.

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:40.695
Yes, I'm Malhotra speaking.
Using STD on my personal phone.

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:42.962
You're coming tomorrow,
aren't you?

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.468
Yes... yes... definitely.

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:47.370
As soon as, we reach Delhi
we'll take a train to Faridabad.

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:48.475
Oh! That 4 'o' clock train!

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:49.807
Yes, that one only.

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:51.637
What're you doing?

01:30:52.513 --> 01:30:52.979
Me?

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:56.143
I was dying hair... Nothing.

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:57.908
No... no... Sorry.
It wasn't for you.

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.313
These servants of Bombay are...

01:30:59.687 --> 01:31:03.487
Okay then, I'll come tomorrow
to receive you.

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:06.986
You'll come with out fail, won't you?
Last time you forgot to come.

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.663
No... no... last time.
This time, I'll definitely make it.

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:12.332
And those essential items
for death anniversary.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:15.331
I'll bring all items for the
anniversary. You don't worry.

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:16.332
Okay then, I'll cut the line now.

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:17.162
I'll also.

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:24.678
Hi guys.

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:28.337
This's Neelam & you're watching your
favourite show. The Neelam show.

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.010
Today, we're going to do something
new in this programme.

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.686
We're going to play a game.

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:35.519
Would you like to
play this game?

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:42.018
They say if you play this game
your hearts' feelings will come out.

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:45.532
I'll tell you a word.

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:48.702
The first word you remember
as soon as I say it.

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.370
You tell it.
But... but... but...

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:54.029
You'll not be given time
to think. Okay.

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:57.874
Okay, we'll start with you.
Cloud.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.206
Sorry! Time is up.

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:03.049
Cloud. - Rain. - Okay.

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:06.978
Beautiful. - Neelam.
- Hey, thanks.

01:32:08.422 --> 01:32:10.720
Heart. - Love. - Okay.

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:12.059
Love. - Seema.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.884
What? You love me?

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:18.061
Hey guys, this game
really works.

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:22.896
Did you see how the heart's feelings
come out? Now, you try this game.

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:25.572
We'll be back after a break.
Take a break.

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:28.908
Stupid game.
Stupid Neelam.

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:31.010
Papa, don't call my Neelam
a stupid, okay.

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:34.414
Okay, I'll not call your
Neelam a stupid.

01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:37.243
Come on tell me quickly,
what's your game?

01:32:37.451 --> 01:32:40.420
Okay papa, ready?
Start... Go...

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:41.922
Sexy.

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:42.922
Grandma.

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:44.921
Shut up. Rogue.
- Father, play it seriously.

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:47.086
Okay, I'll play seriously
- Go ahead. Cloud.

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:51.424
Papa, you shouldn't take so much time.
- I'm drinking water, ain't I?

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:54.260
Okay, I'll not waste time,
we'll start the game finally. Tell me.

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:55.932
Cloud - Wind.

01:32:56.137 --> 01:32:57.263
Mad - You.

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:58.597
Thirst - Me.

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:00.103
Love - Friendship.

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:01.536
Anjali. - Sharma.

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:03.272
Sharma?

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:08.277
Who's this Anjali Sharma?

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:13.345
Who's she? - Nobody.

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:16.953
Come on papa, it's my birthday.
- Okay, its your birthday.

01:33:17.491 --> 01:33:19.618
Anjali Sharma was my
collegmate.

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:22.125
In college?

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:25.795
She was my friend.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.296
Friend.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.462
My best friend.
- But her name is very good, father.

01:33:31.672 --> 01:33:32.297
How did she look like?

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.801
Anjali.

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:39.142
She was unlike other girls.

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:44.478
She was like... we boys.

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:50.488
All girls used to apply make up.

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:55.822
And Anjali... and Anjali used to
play Basket ball.

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.831
And clothes. She used to wear
like my clothes.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.993
Yes, truly.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.108
My Anjali was very naughty.

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:12.004
Applying make up, getting dressed
for occasion. Appear beautiful.

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:15.508
She never knew all this.

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:21.680
Enough or do you want
to ask any thing else.

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:23.183
Papa, where is she?

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:25.525
Don't know.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.200
Oh! I still can't believe, its
your engagement, Anjali.

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:42.137
Listen, Babaji has come to fix
your date of marriage.

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:42.942
Yes.

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:44.811
Give me that.

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:47.846
How much more time will you
take to dress up?

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.107
Aman is getting restless.

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:51.014
Tell him to be wait.

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:52.847
This bride will take her
own time to come.

01:34:58.759 --> 01:35:02.422
Your groom has come
here long back.

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:07.394
Don't delay it any further.
Come out quickly.

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:32.351
I've come to your house to
take you away with me.

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:37.287
To give my heart as a present
in return for your heart.

01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:52.107
Listen, what my every
heart beat is saying.

01:35:52.313 --> 01:36:01.779
Your suitor has come home & the bride is
blushing. Your suitor has come home.

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:16.599
Oh heart! Silly reasons will
not work out any more.

01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:21.332
The girl must go to
her suitor's home.

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:26.544
Listen, what my dot on my
forehead is saying?

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.359
I've fallen into a trap
of a madman.

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:21.831
How could I?
Tell me, my friends. Tell me.

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:27.138
Oh dear! Even your friends are
swooned over my style.

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:31.742
What would they say?
Ask them. Ask them.

01:37:32.179 --> 01:37:36.809
Go away you liar.
Why're you self-praising?

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:46.790
Listen, what your lover is saying.

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:40.370
He's stupid and innocent.
It's my benevolence.

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:44.945
To have accepted him,
tell him. Tell him.

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:50.188
She's teasing me wantonly in
return for her benevolence.

01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:54.791
I've given my heart to her,
tell her. Tell her.

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:59.966
You're ignorant, heart's do
break sometimes, mad man.

01:39:05.306 --> 01:39:10.300
Listen,
what your mad man is saying.

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:53.614
Applying henna.
Jewellary shining.

01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:02.720
Crying and making everyone
also to cry.

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:05.865
You'll go away tomorrow morning.

01:40:06.066 --> 01:40:08.534
You'll make me remember
you so much.

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:06.314
This is old address.
Where can I get her new address?

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.483
Grandpa, can't you do atleast
this for me?

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:11.385
Really, I can't do it for you.
- Really, it's very bad.

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:13.259
Though, you're a Principal,
can't you do this much?

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.121
Why're you bringing my being
Principal between our talk?

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.155
One minute.

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:24.129
Where'll Anjali Sharma be?
She'll definitely know it.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:34.540
Forgive me, principal.

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:37.173
But I had promised Anjali.

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:39.412
That, I'll never reveal
her address to any one.

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:41.584
We had come here
with great hope.

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:46.190
I can understand, but
my promise to Anjali.

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:49.992
Rifat Bee, I'm also Anjali.

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:51.963
Won't you tell me also?

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:59.095
Principal, her engagement
is going on today.

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:01.875
And she'll get married
this week only.

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:04.233
Anjali's mother has faith
in a Babaji.

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:07.140
He's also going there today to
fix a date for the marriage.

01:43:07.581 --> 01:43:08.946
You've come little late.

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:14.246
I was planning to go by tomorrow
afternoon's train.

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:17.921
This marriage will not take palce
My mother told to...

01:43:19.092 --> 01:43:19.956
This won't take place

01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:25.893
Babaji, you've to fix a date
for the marriage. - Yes, child.

01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:30.136
This is Aman's horoscope.
- Okay.

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:33.802
Babaji, Aman wants to go
back to London.

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:37.266
If you fix a date in
this month itself.

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:38.903
This month?

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:39.703
Yes, Babaji.

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.144
Principal, if you had come little
early may be I could?

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:44.816
Yes, but we didn't know.

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:13.104
Don't know why Anjali is in
for a period of bad time.

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:14.846
Till that bad period of
time elapses.

01:44:15.048 --> 01:44:16.345
You can't get her married.

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.321
Then, next month, Babaji?

01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:26.115
Next month also it is not possible.

01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:35.166
Anjali's marriage can't be
fixed before December.

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:47.805
Hello!

01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:02.488
I had heard about
God's miracles.

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:05.225
Today, I've seen one...

01:45:06.366 --> 01:45:07.993
The child's prayers have
been answered.

01:45:08.735 --> 01:45:11.169
Anjali's marriage can't be
performed before December.

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:20.001
Can I ask you something?

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:21.013
Yes.

01:45:23.216 --> 01:45:24.046
Are you happy?

01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:33.348
What's this question?
Off course, I'm happy.

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:38.858
My engagement is over.
Aman is very good boy.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:41.861
He loves me very much.

01:45:43.036 --> 01:45:45.129
And he's...
- But, do you love him?

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:03.119
Mother, I've already had it.
I've already had it.

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:06.890
May be I can't fall
in love again.

01:46:10.397 --> 01:46:15.391
Take it as a compromise.
- Compromise?

01:46:18.438 --> 01:46:23.740
I never expected my daughter will
compromise & not love him.

01:46:26.079 --> 01:46:26.738
I'm also a mother.

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:29.644
Don't I wish you to be happy?

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:31.408
And start a home of your own.

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:36.087
And the home which is on the
foundations of compromise.

01:46:36.289 --> 01:46:36.914
Rather than on love.

01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:41.955
That home will not be a home.
It'll be just a house.

01:46:45.866 --> 01:46:47.026
Rest is your wish.

01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:29.804
Oh no, I can't bear these
devotional songs.

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:33.145
I can.

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:37.879
Do you know with devotional songs
Babaji will read out hymns also.

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:40.143
Wow! Amazing.
You're amazing.

01:47:40.353 --> 01:47:41.217
This Baba...

01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.655
Why?

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:44.153
He had postponed
my marriage.

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:47.986
I can't handle this any more.

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:50.322
Look, even god will get irritated
with so many devotionals.

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:51.019
Why?

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:53.162
Don't you want to make a wish to god?
- What am I to ask?

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:54.834
I've got you.

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:57.532
Now, I think if we have
few children...

01:47:57.938 --> 01:48:00.168
And I'm afraid God can't
help in this.

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:02.170
Whatever it is, I've to do it myself.
- Behave yourself.

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:05.833
Hey Aman... Aman.

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:07.804
Good morning...
good morning.

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:10.912
I saw you in the courtyard in
the morning... Topless.

01:48:11.117 --> 01:48:13.779
Your muscles, what else...
- What is she saying?

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:18.356
Hey fatty... Youth in old age.
- Hey, shut up.

01:48:18.725 --> 01:48:20.090
You might be old.

01:48:20.594 --> 01:48:23.028
Hey move, don't tease him.

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:26.495
What a handsome boy!
Don't you have a brother.

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:27.490
What is she saying?

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:30.498
My Gurdip is also very pretty
- What are you saying?

01:48:31.571 --> 01:48:32.503
Forget your Gurdip.

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:36.208
My Jasbir is
Miss Chandigarh.

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:40.372
Miss chandigarh or
Miss centre.

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:44.945
Listen, Babaji is going to start the
recital of holy hymns. Come quickly.

01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:49.178
Greeting- Bye... bye...
- Come on.

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:51.619
Anjali, a phone call for you.

01:48:52.292 --> 01:48:53.281
Bye excuse me.

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:55.755
Thank you so much,
mother-in-law.

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:57.020
Welcome, son-in-law.

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:06.296
I love you.

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:13.037
I've a small problem.
- What?

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:16.215
Don't go away leaving me alone.

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:17.742
Aman, don't know who's
on the line?

01:49:19.619 --> 01:49:21.780
Anyway you're going to Shimla for
a month on a summer camp.

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:24.120
You're also going to Bombay.

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:27.323
For 24 hours only and
you're going for a month.

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:30.261
Aman you know, I go to attend a
summer camp every year.

01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:31.953
To teach children
singing & dancing.

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:34.825
Now, those children have become
a part of my life.

01:49:35.035 --> 01:49:38.004
Okay. They've also become
a part of your life.

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:40.637
Only I'm remaining.

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:47.677
Why do I feel that
you don't love me?

01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:49.913
Because, I don't love you.

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:52.179
And you don't want to
marry me?

01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:54.410
Right, I don't want to.

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:57.554
If you create any problem this time.

01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:00.849
I'll catch your hand & take you
to the marriage canopy.

01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:03.393
Will you force me?

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:05.460
May be, I've to.

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:08.198
Do you've the guts?

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:11.301
Test me once.

01:50:14.074 --> 01:50:15.701
I'll live with your Aunties.

01:50:16.476 --> 01:50:18.205
You go to Shimla for
the summer camp.

01:50:23.683 --> 01:50:24.149
What?

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:25.648
What? Summer camp?
In Shimla.

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:29.381
You're not going to
any summer camp?

01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:30.917
Baby, snow fall is very heavy
over there.

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:32.457
Papa, it's a summer camp.

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:34.551
Whatever it may be,
you'renot going there.

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:36.056
Is this okay? - Yes.

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:38.587
Papa singing & dancing are
taught in Shimla.

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:41.562
And you also know how much
I like to sing & dance.

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:43.359
When did you start liking
singing & dancing?

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:46.128
I said 'No'. 'No' means 'No'.
That's all...

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:48.070
Papa, it's not fair.

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:54.008
Let her go, son.
- Mom, I'll handle this okay.

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:58.676
But Rahul try to understand, why can't
she go? Even, I'll go with her.

01:50:59.452 --> 01:51:03.946
Papa, I want to go...
- No, Anjali no.

01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:05.954
She'll enjoy- Shut up.

01:51:07.093 --> 01:51:10.153
No one will go when once, I say 'No'.
No need to argue.

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:12.262
None of you will go
to the summer camp.

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:35.713
Did you feel bad?

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:48.594
But this does not mean that you're
going to the summer camp. Okay.

01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:50.898
No one will talk about the
summer camp hereafter.

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:52.731
I'm going to the conference, we'll
talk after I come back.

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:55.804
Papa. - What's it?

01:51:56.743 --> 01:51:57.971
Wear your pant.

01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:03.411
I don't want to wear it.

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:05.414
Wear it if you want to.

01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:17.930
What's it?

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:24.266
Driver, take the pant...
Take the car.

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:31.110
Anjali,
we'll go to the Summer camp.

01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:32.938
But, your papa won't
come there.

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:34.507
Come on, granny.

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:36.441
Do you remember what happened when I
was 4 yrs old?

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:38.047
Papa went to London.

01:52:38.618 --> 01:52:41.314
And I was down with
cough & cold.

01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:42.488
Yes, my dear.

01:52:42.989 --> 01:52:46.117
Granny, papa came back leaving
everything behind.

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:46.992
Then...

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:59.701
Look, according to me this export policy
is not going to hold much water.

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:01.469
Sorry. - Don't worry -
It's okay.

01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:02.808
It's okay.

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:04.904
Look every expert is going
to ask himself.

01:53:07.981 --> 01:53:09.812
Indian exporter's conference.
Good evening.

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:11.811
Hello, may I speak to

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:26.727
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:29.527

01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:35.166
Anjali.

01:53:36.409 --> 01:53:37.603
Tell him that we're going
to the summer camp.

01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:39.108
And keep the phone down quickly.

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:43.243
Attn. Mr. Rahul Khanna, Mr. Aman Mehra.
Call for you please.

01:53:44.284 --> 01:53:45.717

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:52.855
Sorry. - It's alright.

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:53.854
Take care.

01:53:54.627 --> 01:53:55.594
Hi sweet heart.

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:58.021
Hello... - Hello...

01:53:58.231 --> 01:53:59.459
Hello... - Speak... - Hello...

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:01.361
I can't hear anything.

01:54:01.734 --> 01:54:03.634
I can hear you.
Tell me.

01:54:03.837 --> 01:54:05.134
Hi sweet heart.

01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:07.929
I'm thinking about you only.

01:54:10.777 --> 01:54:14.372
Listen, I'm going to the summer camp
tomorrow morning. - Where?

01:54:14.581 --> 01:54:16.776
Summer camp.
Again Summer camp?

01:54:16.983 --> 01:54:19.577
I once told you not to go.
So, you're not going.

01:54:19.853 --> 01:54:22.117
Okay, listen...
I'm feeling very...

01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:25.047
Give me a kiss.

01:54:25.959 --> 01:54:27.221
I'm your mother speaking.

01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:29.391
I don't like such jokes.

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:31.063
It has been 10 years,
since my mother died.

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:34.131
Oh my God! Why is he
killing me alive?

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:36.902
No summer camp...
Do you understand that.

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:38.660
Aman, why're you shouting?

01:54:38.872 --> 01:54:41.636
I'm shouting, because I told you not
to go to the Summer camp once.

01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:44.002
Listen, if you ever talk
about summer camp,

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:46.269
I'll come home & slap you.

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:48.174
Aman, you've gone mad.

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:54.486
Your papa has gone mad.

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:03.420
Yeah Anjali.

01:55:05.899 --> 01:55:07.264
Confusion... Confusion. -
Hi.

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:09.264
Hi! I'm Rahul Khanna.
- Aman Mehra, how're you doing?

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:11.562
I think she got confused as the
names were the same.

01:55:11.771 --> 01:55:15.935
But I'm sure my Anjali is very
beautiful than yours.

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:19.801
No. My Anjali is very beautiful.
- May be.

01:55:20.013 --> 01:55:22.538
But, she can't be beautiful
than my Anjali.

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:24.781
My Anjali is my 8 year
old daughter.

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:26.110
Oh shit.

01:55:26.886 --> 01:55:28.683
Then, your Anjali will be
beautiful than mine.

01:55:28.988 --> 01:55:30.455
Anyway best of luck
with your Anjali.

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:31.783
Best of luck to you too.

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:32.616
Bye take care.
- Bye take care.

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:38.430
Dear father, we've started
without informing you.

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:43.430
But, you know that I like
singing & dancing very much.

01:55:43.736 --> 01:55:45.567
But, I'm really sorry, father.

01:55:45.838 --> 01:55:47.772
Don't miss me much, okay.

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:49.471
Love you, Anjali.

01:55:50.376 --> 01:55:51.638
I can't do that.

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:59.483
Good morning kids, welcome
to camp sunshine.

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:02.812
I, Colonel Almeida,
Manager of this camp.

01:56:03.022 --> 01:56:06.150

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:17.360
Who is this child?

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:22.935
Who're you?
- Me? I'm a granny.

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:26.574
Whose granny?
- Anjali's granny & who're you?

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.205
I'm the Manager of this camp.
- Hello.

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:34.512
Hello listen, no mummy, daddy,
granny allowed into this camp.

01:56:34.988 --> 01:56:35.852
Oh really!

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:39.354
So, do you want me to allow Anjali
to stay here all alone? - What?

01:56:40.727 --> 01:56:42.354
Have you seen Ms. Anjali?

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:46.226
What's it?

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:47.528
What's it?

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:58.101
Britishers flag in my India.

01:56:58.478 --> 01:56:59.410
I'll see to this right now.

01:57:01.247 --> 01:57:01.872
One minute.

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:04.376
Almeida. -
Go... Go... Go...

01:57:05.084 --> 01:57:05.709
What's it?

01:57:06.352 --> 01:57:08.047
Aren't you ashamed?

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:10.454
You've hoisted a Britishers' flag.

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:17.689
I love England, my father was a
tailor during British Rule.

01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:20.023
He had only stitched this flag.
You know...

01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:23.495
Britishers are gone,
but left Almeida. - That's good.

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:24.397
You shameless!

01:57:24.604 --> 01:57:27.903
You must teach children
that 'India' is Great.

01:57:28.107 --> 01:57:29.734
Yeah. Who's Bharat?

01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:18.653
Here you go? -

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:21.054

Why is your name,
Anjali?

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:39.110
May be my parents
liked this name.

01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:39.971
That's why.

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:41.843

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:45.176

Tell me,
where is the kitchen?

01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:30.186
I want to see, how you cook? -
What?

01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:32.627
And where is the prayer room?

01:59:33.299 --> 01:59:34.596
Pooja has not come for duty today.

01:59:35.801 --> 01:59:38.395
I mean prayer which means
offering prayers to God.

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:42.131
Oh madam, such facilities are not
available here. - What?

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:44.203
Don't you offer prayers
to God early morning?

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:46.237
Aarthi, who is Aarthi?

01:59:59.458 --> 02:00:00.516
Are you counting the stars?

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:06.626
Are you counting the stars?

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:11.436
Doesn't open his mouth at all.

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:15.099
Good night, Mr. AImeida.

02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:16.275
Good night darling.

02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:19.444
London bridge is falling down
...Falling down.

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:40.799
Dear God, how're you?

02:00:42.235 --> 02:00:43.793
Please keep my daddy happy.

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:46.995
And see to that he doesn't
miss me much.

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:52.075
You know that he can't do anything
without me. Please... Okay?

02:00:52.845 --> 02:00:53.311
Caught you.

02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:57.308
Oh Miss Anjali. Hi.

All prayers for your papa.

02:01:00.686 --> 02:01:01.710
Aren't there any left
for your mom?

02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:05.523
Why should I wish God
for my mom?

02:01:05.825 --> 02:01:07.588
Why? - She is with him.

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:10.992
She can wish by herself.

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:22.007
Hey.

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:24.042
Go to bed soon,

02:08:07.479 --> 02:08:08.946
Anjali.

02:08:32.838 --> 02:08:39.471
Oh My darling

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:55.824
I waited for you for years

02:09:06.205 --> 02:09:12.508
My helpless heart

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:25.848
What to do, Oh!

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:50.540
Hai... Hai...

02:09:57.923 --> 02:09:59.390
You're in good health,
aren't you?

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:01.223
Yes... Why?

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:08.897
Because, you're looking so pretty
...This Saree.

02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:19.410
I had no clue about Tina.
I'm sorry.

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:26.076
How could you have
simply disappeared.

02:10:26.952 --> 02:10:28.419
Residence was changed.

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:30.581
Will relationship ever change?
Have you changed your relationship also?

02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:36.758
Because when I needed my friend
you weren't available?

02:10:41.166 --> 02:10:43.760
Didn't you marry again?

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:47.931
I couldn't find you otherwise
I would've married you.

02:10:50.475 --> 02:10:54.104
Anjali, we're born
once and we die once.

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:57.777
Marriage is also conducted once.
And love...

02:10:58.317 --> 02:10:59.443
Is a one time affair.

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.612
You also didn't get married.

02:11:04.756 --> 02:11:05.723
You weren't available,
that's why.

02:11:10.495 --> 02:11:14.295
Ah... That... is a shooting star.

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:19.634
You still believe in that.
- No... And you?

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:38.489
Hey... - Good night

Do you have any idea. -

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:39.877
Prayer will have the answer child.

02:12:40.252 --> 02:12:42.049

I said girls can play
basket ball & he said...

02:13:14.619 --> 02:13:16.416
Girls can't play basket ball.

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:18.418
He told you the truth &
you started fighting with him.

02:13:18.623 --> 02:13:21.922
Didn't Anjali defeat you
in basket ball.

02:13:22.127 --> 02:13:22.752
Keep quiet... Shut up.

Not every day... Only sometimes

Hey, try... Hey...

02:16:31.716 --> 02:16:33.273
Idiot.

Hey, if you don't know how to play,
atleast don't cheat.

02:17:20.764 --> 02:17:22.323
Ay, don't call me a cheat.

02:17:22.566 --> 02:17:25.001
Hey! You're a cheat...
Cheat... cheat.

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:33.007
Girls can't play basket ball.

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:37.177
Girls can't play basket ball...

02:17:42.053 --> 02:17:44.681
Hey, give it to me.
Hey, look at the loser.

02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:56.591
Girl is an absolute stranger.

02:18:56.795 --> 02:19:00.424
She's the dream, the truth
and the fable.

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:04.090
Look at this mad girl,
she hasn't changed at all.

02:19:04.636 --> 02:19:07.934
She's the same insane girl.

02:19:16.647 --> 02:19:20.277
Boy is an absolute stranger.

02:19:20.485 --> 02:19:24.285
He's a dream, the truth
and a fable.

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:27.947
Yes, this mad fellow
hasn't
changed at all.

02:19:28.493 --> 02:19:31.620
He's the same insane fellow.

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:23.840
Being so near yet so far.

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:27.514
Can't guess
what was the obstacle.

02:20:28.386 --> 02:20:31.685
It was a very fascinating period.

02:20:31.890 --> 02:20:35.519
When you were close to me.

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:43.023
Why're you lost in wilderness,
I'm here, just look.

02:21:57.375 --> 02:22:01.175
Even in the crowd.
I'm so Ionely.

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:04.845
I was immersed in your
remembrance all the time.

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:12.516
Somebody restrain me,
before I get emotional.

02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:20.354
My steps are faultering,
give me the supporting hand.

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:32.869
Girl is an absolute stranger.

02:22:33.077 --> 02:22:36.877
She's the dream,
the truth & the fable.

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:40.547
Yes this mad fellow
hasn't changed at all.

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:44.213
He's the same insane fellow...

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:24.258
You showed me some green
pastures sweetheart.

02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:32.768
I'm neither able to keep awake
nor sleep.

02:23:36.474 --> 02:23:39.602
Something is happening.

02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:47.443
Something is happening.

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:51.615
Something is happening.

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:54.617
Something is happening.

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:59.460
Okay Nikhil, this's your letter.
And Mamta, this's yours.

02:24:00.331 --> 02:24:04.461
Okay kids, listen. All the mothers are
complaining that no one is replying.

02:24:04.702 --> 02:24:07.637
And I've complained to your mother,
that you're not saying anything.

02:24:08.339 --> 02:24:12.139
Okay, stop that drawing, stop drawing
Stop drawing, okay.

02:24:12.377 --> 02:24:15.471
All of you will write letters
to your mummies, okay.

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:19.647
Come on start. Pass it down.
Pass it down.

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:21.478
Anjali, you also write
to your mummy...

02:24:54.752 --> 02:24:56.379
If you were here today...

02:24:57.155 --> 02:25:01.387
I could've proudly said that
Anjali is your daughter.

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:06.726
Because, she's very cute.

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:13.070
And why not!
Her name is Anjali.

02:25:17.709 --> 02:25:21.577
And do you know what's
tops about her?

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:26.082
She's absolutely your replica.

02:25:28.853 --> 02:25:36.259
Same eyes, same face,
she's just like you.

02:25:54.812 --> 02:26:00.114
Now, I don't find this family
incomplete... incomplete.

02:26:01.819 --> 02:26:08.691
Hi kids, good morning.
Are you ready? Say cheese.

02:26:10.995 --> 02:26:13.122
Oh no, you're taking a
photograph, without me.

02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:14.127
Okay, I'll also join.

02:26:14.332 --> 02:26:15.959
Oh God!

Very pretty. - Shall I sit here?
Please come, sit.

No... No... not there, little higher.

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:36.318
Not there, little higher.

02:26:36.854 --> 02:26:38.481
He is planning to send me
right up (to heavens).

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:40.987
A little higher... - 
Okay.

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:43.326
Shall I sit here?
Okay.

02:26:45.263 --> 02:26:45.991
How am I looking?

02:26:47.031 --> 02:26:50.330
You're fantastic, beautiful.
- Thank you.

02:26:50.868 --> 02:26:52.836
Okay ready, I'm ready.

02:26:53.371 --> 02:27:00.675
Okay, 1, 2, cheese.
Fantastic... - Yeah.

02:27:07.218 --> 02:27:10.346
That's good.
Hold it please.

02:27:11.422 --> 02:27:13.014
What happened Mr. AImeda.

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:18.020
Oh No. I don't know. Something
missing. Something wrong.

02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:22.027
Is it okay now?

02:27:29.907 --> 02:27:32.034
It's perfect, take it.

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:41.214
Please excuse me.
Now just the two of you.

02:27:42.086 --> 02:27:45.214
Thank you very much.
Now a little closer.

02:27:47.592 --> 02:27:49.389
Enough Mr. AImeda. So many photos have been taken.

02:27:49.927 --> 02:27:53.727
Anjali, let him take it.
- Please come on.

02:27:54.098 --> 02:27:56.225
Colonel, Colonel...,
no please.

02:27:56.434 --> 02:27:56.900
Hey, come on Anjali.

02:28:06.944 --> 02:28:08.411
Look at this mother-in-law,
vow.

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:12.575
How could anybody else be
so impressive.

02:28:13.618 --> 02:28:14.585
Too good... too good.

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:16.912
Anjali is looking smashing
in this photo, isn't it she?

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:21.421
Really! I didn't see her.
- Save it. I know everything.

02:28:21.626 --> 02:28:25.084
She isn't here. You're pleasing
yourself by seeing her photos.

02:28:25.296 --> 02:28:26.923
What to do mother-in-law.

02:28:27.298 --> 02:28:30.096
Aman, marriage is scheduled
in December, isn't it?

02:28:30.301 --> 02:28:32.098
Why don't you go to
London & come?

02:28:32.303 --> 02:28:35.101
No. I'll not go anywhere.
- Why?

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:38.103
Because I don't trust your
daughter at all.

02:28:38.976 --> 02:28:41.774
She has agreed for the marriage
after a lot of sweat.

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:43.776
Till the circle,
what do call them?

02:28:43.981 --> 02:28:44.447
'Pherey! '

02:28:44.715 --> 02:28:46.114
Yes. Till the 'Pherey' (marriage)
Ceremony is over,

02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:48.285
I shan't leave this place.

02:28:48.853 --> 02:28:49.785
Mad fellow!

02:28:49.987 --> 02:28:51.454
You love her immensely,
don't you?

02:28:51.656 --> 02:28:53.283
No... Yes.

02:28:56.327 --> 02:29:08.296
But, I feel... She doesn't
love me, isn't it?

02:29:11.509 --> 02:29:15.969
Hey, mother-in-law,
she doesn't, isn't it?

02:29:17.515 --> 02:29:20.814
Aman, you've gone mad!

02:29:28.025 --> 02:29:28.992
She didn't reply.

02:29:30.227 --> 02:29:33.993
Today we are going to play a
new game called 'Dumb-show'.

02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:37.827
There're 2 teams
in this game. Team A.

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:39.661
Thank you...

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:41.668
And this is Team B.

02:29:44.875 --> 02:29:50.006
In this game, one team will tell one
or 2 players of the other team,

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:52.842
Name of a film, quietly.

02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:54.517
Then, the players of that team,

02:29:54.719 --> 02:29:58.849
Will have to explain to his team
without talking & only by gestures.

02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:02.685
The name of the film.

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:04.857
Remember, you can't utter
a word, okay?

02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:07.522
Let's start with the team A.

02:30:15.239 --> 02:30:16.866
How can I act?

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:23.706
Come on Miss Anjali.
- Okay... okay...

02:30:25.249 --> 02:30:31.711
Now see, it's like you know.
- You can't talk cheating... cheating.

02:30:32.490 --> 02:30:34.549
This is cheating,
you're a cheat.

02:30:34.825 --> 02:30:37.225
Okay, okay, okay...

02:30:38.496 --> 02:30:40.555
Hey come on my friend.
Can't you do this much. Go on.

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:53.568
Everybody clap. She's doing.
It's working out.

02:31:05.256 --> 02:31:09.716
Dance vigorously.

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:11.887
Close your eyes, vow.

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:17.897
Let's have fun together

02:31:18.102 --> 02:31:21.299
Rangeela

02:31:21.505 --> 02:31:25.032
Rangeela! Yeah... Yeah... everybody.
- Yeah, that's good.

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:36.246
Alright... It was... It was very sexy
...Oh. - Thanks.

02:31:40.191 --> 02:31:43.456
No... No... No... I can't do it.
I can't do it.

02:31:43.661 --> 02:31:46.789
Come on grandma,
come on grandma.

02:31:48.666 --> 02:31:50.463
...No children... No... No...

02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:53.636
Even I don't see
Hindi pictures, you know.

02:31:53.838 --> 02:31:55.635
I love. - Keep quiet.

02:31:56.674 --> 02:31:59.472
Come on, grandma...
Come on mummy.

02:32:01.345 --> 02:32:02.141
Okay son.

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:05.640
She has agreed.

02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:08.478
You go there, go there.
- Where. - There.

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:09.152
But why?

02:32:09.353 --> 02:32:11.981
Because, I'm telling you, go there
- Grandma, has gone mad man.

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:15.316
Yes, now bend down.
- Ben... Bend down.

02:32:15.526 --> 02:32:16.652
Like this? - Yes.

02:32:29.039 --> 02:32:32.668
Sister, your brother-in-law
is mad.

02:32:35.212 --> 02:32:37.339
Mummy Madhuri
"HUM APKE HEIN KAUN".

02:32:41.218 --> 02:32:43.186
Okay, its my turn.

02:32:49.393 --> 02:32:51.190
There's no such film like that
- Yes papa its there.

02:32:51.395 --> 02:32:52.362
No... No... No such film
has run here.

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:55.198
Its there papa.
- I haven't seen such a film.

02:32:55.733 --> 02:32:56.199
Arey... One minute.

02:32:58.402 --> 02:33:01.303
It is there, there's a film
by that name, I've seen myself.

02:33:01.572 --> 02:33:02.368
What's the name of the film?

02:33:04.074 --> 02:33:04.870
Alright, okay...

02:33:14.418 --> 02:33:18.218
Yeah... Okay... Three... three words.

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:27.063
Yes, I know three words
are there, next...

02:33:29.266 --> 02:33:30.062
I can't do it.

02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:34.234
Rahul, what're you doing?
- Your son has gone mad.

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:40.738
Rahul, I can't understand anything.
What're you doing?

02:33:43.714 --> 02:33:46.239
Come on Rahul,
now... no... now.

02:33:51.322 --> 02:33:54.257
Yeah, what's it... What?

02:34:02.132 --> 02:34:05.260
I love you... How to mono act?

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:12.942
Do it again?

02:34:17.147 --> 02:34:18.774
No... No... No... No...
He's doing it wrong.

02:34:18.983 --> 02:34:19.449
I love you.

02:34:26.156 --> 02:34:26.781
I love you.

02:34:27.992 --> 02:34:28.788
You couldn't do that much.

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:33.118
Couldn't. - If you could,
we would have won.

02:34:41.505 --> 02:34:42.472
Come on, get into the barn.

02:34:43.173 --> 02:34:51.137
Run... Nikhil... Come on
come on... faster.

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:54.484
Come on, get into the barn.

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:03.489
Give me that for a minute
- Okay, like it.

02:35:11.368 --> 02:35:13.165
Have you gone mad? Stupid.

02:35:14.705 --> 02:35:16.172
Anjali. - Yes.

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:18.341
I'm feeling very cold.

02:35:21.712 --> 02:35:23.680
Come with me, I'll take you
to a place. - But...

02:35:52.076 --> 02:35:52.872
No music.

02:38:37.274 --> 02:38:46.046
I love you... I love you...
Love you. I really love you.

02:38:46.283 --> 02:38:48.217
Hey, I love you too.

02:38:56.927 --> 02:38:59.555
Almeda can't you plug the
leakage properly, go up...

02:39:00.831 --> 02:39:02.560
Mummy,
did Anjali, come here?

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:04.893
She is sitting here.
- Not this one, the other one.

02:39:05.102 --> 02:39:06.899
You help him up there.

02:39:11.108 --> 02:39:11.836
Rahul, I...

02:39:12.609 --> 02:39:16.170
Anjali...
I wanted to talk to you.

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:19.749
Actually, I wanted to talk to
you there, but you suddenly...

02:39:24.121 --> 02:39:25.748
This stable is your summer camp.

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:31.652
Hi guy, hey I know you.

02:39:32.462 --> 02:39:35.761
From where...
Yes telephone man.

02:39:36.466 --> 02:39:36.932
Yeah.

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:39.102
What's up dude?

02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:41.437
But what're you doing
in this stable?

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:46.106
Hey, is she your Anjali?

02:39:52.482 --> 02:39:53.449
Hey, she is my Anjali.

02:39:56.987 --> 02:39:59.785
She is my Anjali.

02:40:17.341 --> 02:40:19.809
Wow... Amazing man, too good.

02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:21.978
Just like Michael John
my friend you're too good.

02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:25.148
I'm not that good.
I've lost. - Lost?

02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:27.817
I don't believe this friend
its not possible.

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:29.315
Okay, tell me, who won?

02:40:31.521 --> 02:40:32.317
Your Anjali?

02:40:34.691 --> 02:40:38.058
Your Anjali. - My Anjali?
In Basket Ball.

02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:42.828
Tell me onething. You were with
her in the college.

02:40:43.533 --> 02:40:45.330
How's is that girl?
Who were her friends?

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:46.661
I want to know...

02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:47.837
She was a VIP of the college.

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:50.665
Everybody took their
problems to her.

02:40:51.541 --> 02:40:52.735
Nothing has changed.

02:40:53.043 --> 02:40:55.739
Look, I've also confronted
her with my problem.

02:40:57.547 --> 02:40:58.514
What is your problem?

02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:04.509
My problem is that I love her
very much, you know?

02:41:05.222 --> 02:41:07.850
I know. - You know...

02:41:09.559 --> 02:41:11.686
What type of a friend you are?

02:41:12.396 --> 02:41:14.193
You didn't attend the betrothal
of your friend.

02:41:14.731 --> 02:41:15.527
Betrothal is over?

02:41:18.568 --> 02:41:24.370
Yes. There were lot of problems in it.
Marriage is in December, I think.

02:41:25.909 --> 02:41:30.539
Listen, tell your friend that if the
marriage doesn't go through in December,

02:41:31.081 --> 02:41:31.547
Then... I'll marry this
Basket Ball...

02:41:34.418 --> 02:41:37.546
Marry the Basket Ball?

02:41:38.422 --> 02:41:42.051
See you. Dude okay dude
- Basketball? - Bye.

02:41:53.937 --> 02:41:57.236
We take birth once,
we die once...

02:41:58.108 --> 02:42:01.908
We marry once,
we love also once.

02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:21.093
Men are very fragile, child.

02:42:22.966 --> 02:42:24.263
They're very fragile.

02:42:26.303 --> 02:42:27.930
They carve out principles.

02:42:28.972 --> 02:42:32.931
But they forget, that love has
no principles.

02:42:34.644 --> 02:42:35.508
And we.

02:42:36.313 --> 02:42:39.111
Make these obstinate fragile
men realize,

02:42:40.317 --> 02:42:44.617
That love is born out of the vibrations
of hearts & not through principles.

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:51.787
But Love can bear fruit,
only if you express it.

02:42:56.333 --> 02:42:58.961
You express your feelings Anjali.

02:43:03.173 --> 02:43:07.200
Sometimes expressing of feelings
may lead to heart break.

02:43:08.678 --> 02:43:11.647
If you don't express then
will it lead to fulfillment?

02:43:13.016 --> 02:43:14.313
Will it lead to fulfillment?

02:43:18.855 --> 02:43:26.159
Congratulations and celebrations.

02:43:26.363 --> 02:43:29.992
We wish you to lead a
happy married life.

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:34.330
Congratulations.
- Congratulations & celebrations.

02:43:36.706 --> 02:43:38.833
What's this Anjali?
You didn't tell me.

02:43:39.042 --> 02:43:40.839
Aman told me that you're getting...

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:43.573
Hey, congratulations.

02:43:44.714 --> 02:43:48.172
You're happy, aren't you?
You're happy, aren't you?

02:43:49.386 --> 02:43:50.853
Are you happy to know it?

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:53.253
I'm very happy.

02:43:54.724 --> 02:43:59.024
Then how can I be happy?
- I didn't get you.

02:44:02.065 --> 02:44:06.024
Something is happening Rahul.
You won't understand.

02:44:14.911 --> 02:44:19.280
Something is happening Anjali,
you didn't understand.

02:44:26.756 --> 02:44:28.223
Uncle! - Yes.

02:44:28.425 --> 02:44:30.393
Shall I ask you something? -
Why not?

02:44:30.594 --> 02:44:33.563
Why're you marrying Miss Anjali.

02:44:34.097 --> 02:44:36.065
What? Why? Anything wrong?

02:44:36.266 --> 02:44:37.062
Yes, it's wrong.

02:44:37.767 --> 02:44:39.962
See, it's very simple. -
Explain.

02:44:40.437 --> 02:44:41.734
You're so handsome.

02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:45.067
What happened? -
So good looking.

02:44:45.275 --> 02:44:47.243
Oh! Thank you so much.

02:44:47.777 --> 02:44:50.746
But Miss. Anjali doesn't
look so good, very bad.

02:44:52.115 --> 02:44:56.074
You know you're right.
She's dark, plumply, short.

02:44:57.287 --> 02:45:00.256
Yes. You can get any girl.

02:45:00.457 --> 02:45:02.425
I can get any girl? - Yes.

02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:07.260
Will you marry me?
Me! No, no, no...

02:45:07.464 --> 02:45:08.658
Why am I that bad.

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:13.428
Then, you'll have to search a
nice girl for me.

02:45:13.637 --> 02:45:16.105
I've searched. -
Who - That one.

02:45:22.145 --> 02:45:23.271
This MTV girl.

02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:25.948
Hai this is Neelam show, Yo. - Yo.

02:45:27.384 --> 02:45:28.942
Than what'll happen to this Anjali?

02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:30.683
You'll have to search someone
for her too.

02:45:30.954 --> 02:45:33.445
I've searched. Have you?

02:45:33.657 --> 02:45:36.626
Shall I tell. - No, no.
- I'll tell you... - No... no.

02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:40.123
No, no, I'll tell you.
- No, no... please no...

02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:43.128
Aman I want to go back to-night.

02:46:26.443 --> 02:46:27.375
Good bye Mr. AImeda.

02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:09.107
You are going?

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:15.113
Please don't go.

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:29.395
You had given this to Tina.

02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:33.066
Who was to start a new life.

02:48:36.806 --> 02:48:39.001
You're also starting a
new life today.

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:44.742
I know.

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:49.751
You & Rahul will be
very happy together.

02:48:52.555 --> 02:49:00.018
Aman, Aman... Aman.

02:49:02.132 --> 02:49:16.342
You shouldn't remember me.

02:49:16.579 --> 02:49:19.275
'How to tell this to someone.'

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:31.951
'Heart cried, tears
swelled in the eyes.'

02:49:32.128 --> 02:49:35.461
'How to tell this to someone.'

02:49:43.806 --> 02:49:45.467
Please make arrangements
for the marriage.

02:49:46.609 --> 02:49:48.304
I don't wish to wait any further.

02:49:48.912 --> 02:49:49.469
But, Anjali.

02:49:50.013 --> 02:49:53.141
'Babaji' said that there's no auspicious
date before December. - Mother!

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:58.078
Date doesn't generate happiness,
fate does.

02:50:00.356 --> 02:50:01.721
No body can change that.

02:51:21.437 --> 02:51:24.167
See Aman has come.
- That too on a pony.

02:51:31.214 --> 02:51:33.079
Priest has come, someone
attend to him and...

02:51:35.451 --> 02:51:35.917
Greetings.

02:51:37.854 --> 02:51:38.912
You're Rahul, aren't you?

02:51:40.456 --> 02:51:45.917
Yes, madam. I & Anjali... - I know.

02:51:46.663 --> 02:51:48.756
Anjali is getting married?

02:51:50.433 --> 02:51:55.598
Yes. Anjali took such a
hurried decision to marry...

02:51:55.805 --> 02:51:58.706
That I did get time to make
full preparations for it.

02:52:00.576 --> 02:52:04.945
I'm coming. Please sit down.

02:52:05.815 --> 02:52:06.782
I'll join you soon.

02:52:16.826 --> 02:52:17.349
It is said.

02:52:18.261 --> 02:52:20.229
That after seeing the shooting star,
if you wish for something.

02:52:21.097 --> 02:52:21.927
You'll get it.

02:54:37.333 --> 02:54:43.795
'As the restless sweet heart'.

02:54:54.083 --> 02:55:00.283
'I waited for years'.

02:55:01.157 --> 02:55:06.891
'But you never said even this'.

02:55:07.230 --> 02:55:10.290
'What you said now'.

02:55:10.967 --> 02:55:17.031
'My helpless heart cries mutely'.

02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:20.004
'What to do, alas! '.

02:55:20.843 --> 02:55:23.607
'Something is happening'.

02:55:55.511 --> 02:55:57.877
Time is running out,
call the bride.

02:56:04.253 --> 02:56:06.915
Auspicious time for the marriage is
passing away, call the bride.

02:56:10.059 --> 02:56:10.855
Anjali come.

02:57:01.877 --> 02:57:04.903
I'll hold your hand & take you to the
canopy, didn't I tell you?

02:58:04.707 --> 02:58:05.401
You know it.

02:58:06.909 --> 02:58:08.968
I always wanted to see your eyes
brimming with the love,

02:58:10.646 --> 02:58:11.544
Which is existing in my eyes.

02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:15.576
I've seen that love today.

02:58:18.854 --> 02:58:19.980
But that is not for me.

02:58:22.191 --> 02:58:23.317
You're mad Anjali.

02:58:25.628 --> 02:58:27.118
You've loved only him.

02:58:29.598 --> 02:58:33.193
Ever since you understood
and known what love is.

02:58:34.437 --> 02:58:35.734
You've loved only him.

02:58:37.406 --> 02:58:38.703
Rahul is your first love.

02:58:42.578 --> 02:58:43.806
And what's first love?

02:58:45.247 --> 02:58:46.043
You ask me about it.

02:58:51.320 --> 02:58:54.983
And you, you were sacrificing
all that for me.

02:58:56.559 --> 02:58:57.025
Mad girl.

02:59:00.362 --> 02:59:01.829
How can I interfere with that love,

02:59:05.501 --> 02:59:06.661
Which was never meant for me.

02:59:12.675 --> 02:59:13.869
And I'm told by somebody.

02:59:15.344 --> 02:59:17.312
That I'm so handsome that
I can get any girl.

02:59:33.162 --> 02:59:33.821
That is right.

02:59:49.845 --> 02:59:50.311
Go...

02:59:57.853 --> 02:59:58.319
Go.

03:01:25.774 --> 03:01:30.211
Groom is having the
garland of flowers

03:01:30.613 --> 03:01:35.050
Bride's hands are
smeared with 'Henna'

03:01:35.417 --> 03:01:39.945
What's the dot on the
forehead saying...

03:01:40.122 --> 03:01:45.025
Groom has come home...

03:01:45.361 --> 03:01:49.957
Why the bride is feeling shy,
groom has come home

03:02:52.161 --> 03:02:55.824
Girl is an absolute stranger

03:02:56.398 --> 03:02:59.890
She is the dream,
the truth, the fable

03:03:00.269 --> 03:03:03.796
Look at this mad girl,
she hasn't changed at all

03:03:04.006 --> 03:03:07.237
She's the same insane girl

03:03:15.751 --> 03:03:19.517
Boy is an absolute stranger

03:03:19.788 --> 03:03:23.246
He's a dream,
the truth and a fable

03:03:23.625 --> 03:03:27.789
Yes, this mad fellow
hasn't changed at all

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:31.555
He's the same insane fellow

03:03:32.305 --> 03:03:38.370
