Captain Kirk taught you.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.410
-Let it go.-But I just bought a new scythe.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.023
Ugh, Landru.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.460

-from the TOS era.
-TOS?

Seems like they were stumbling

01:18.252 --> 01:21.951

every week back then.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.040
Nothing against

01:29.089 --> 01:31.091
Yeah, but "popping in" is
against regulation.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.875
We would need specific orders.

No. Let them know

that we came running

Yo, yo, Mariner!

through the, um, lower decks,

08:26.636 --> 08:28.638

some hand pies.

didn't know my name.

He called me "Jen."
Who here is named "Jen"?!

08:41.782 --> 08:44.175
Ugh. You are so right. He was
clearly kissing your butt.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.090
It's not like
he had a prewritten letter

08:46.134 --> 08:47.788
of recommendation which would
save you so much time

08:47.831 --> 08:49.267
since all you had
to do is sign it.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.792
-Oh, Boimler, not you!
-Ransom's picking someone

08:51.835 --> 08:53.271

Yeah, but it's the <i>Sac.
That's a huge career boost!</i>

in a captain's chair?

Looking good, girlfriend!

09:01.453 --> 09:03.151
Get phased, Lundy.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.632
Wait. No one would know me
on the <i>Sacramento.</i>

09:05.675 --> 09:07.372
I'd be a nobody again,
like you!

09:07.416 --> 09:09.157
I'm not a nobody. I...

Maybe <i>I</i>should apply
to the <i>Sacramento.</i>

09:10.767 --> 09:12.116
I don't know.
They might be looking

09:12.160 --> 09:14.031
for someone a little less
criminally insubordinate.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.686
Good call. I'd better start
adjusting my attitude, sir.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.296
-Ew. Don't call me "sir."
-Yes, sir.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.994
-Don't.
-You technically
outrank me, sir.

Stop it.
-Is that an order?

09:21.909 --> 09:23.954
-BOIMLER: Yes. I mean, no.
-Permission to go
to my station, sir?

09:23.998 --> 09:27.131
-You have a station?
-Ha-ha! Good one, sir. Mm-hmm.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.742
Nobody's gonna fall for that.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.134
-[yelps]
-I want to give Mariner
a present!

09:30.178 --> 09:31.658
That's a processing hub,

09:31.701 --> 09:34.138
and that's a pattern-buffer
maintenance hatch.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.358
So, hey, um, do you want me
to call you "Exocomp,"

09:36.401 --> 09:37.925
or do you have
an alpha-numeric name,
