-  Can you believe this?

02:04.081 --> 02:05.572
- Give her a ride.
- No.

02:05.572 --> 02:07.905
- Why not?
- It's dangerous.

02:11.987 --> 02:13.540
She might be psycho.

02:13.540 --> 02:14.627
Is she alone?

02:14.627 --> 02:15.538
I mean, who does that?

02:15.538 --> 02:16.538
- Just stop.

02:19.564 --> 02:22.397
(Katherine sighs)

02:28.751 --> 02:30.388
She looks all right to me.

02:30.388 --> 02:33.058
- Great, and you'll be
perving her the whole trip?

02:33.058 --> 02:34.114
No thanks.

02:34.114 --> 02:35.879
- She's just a girl.

02:35.879 --> 02:38.272
She's no match for a woman like you.

02:38.272 --> 02:39.105
- Thanks.

02:40.156 --> 02:41.989
Next time, sweetheart.

02:51.917 --> 02:55.167
What a rip-off.
- Well, you'll survive.

02:57.448 --> 03:00.022
- I need a break, don't I?

03:00.022 --> 03:01.473
- We both do.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.306
- Careful, put those on the floor.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.133
Your turn, Prince Charming.

03:10.133 --> 03:12.383
-  Yes, your majesty.

03:13.930 --> 03:17.097
(eclectic rock music)

03:49.328 --> 03:50.209
-  That girl.

03:50.209 --> 03:52.533
- Let's stop.
- No.

03:52.533 --> 03:56.366
-  That's not very
motherly of you, Kat.

03:57.497 --> 03:59.580
-  Okay, stop.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.641
Hi, sweetie, where you going?

04:22.250 --> 04:23.750
- This way, still.

04:25.220 --> 04:27.644
- We can give you a ride
to the next turn-off.

04:27.644 --> 04:29.144
Hugh?
- Of course.

04:33.683 --> 04:34.516
- Come.

04:37.430 --> 04:38.263
Wait.

04:42.134 --> 04:44.134
I have a delicate package.

04:46.256 --> 04:47.089
There.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.115
I'm Katherine.

04:59.073 --> 04:59.906
And Hugh.

05:01.748 --> 05:02.748
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:05.528 --> 05:08.574
- What's your name, sweetie?

05:08.574 --> 05:09.407
- Liza.

05:10.623 --> 05:11.456
- Okay.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.798
Where you from?

05:14.798 --> 05:16.233
- I'm from an alien planet.

05:16.233 --> 05:20.316
I'm waiting for the rest
of my people to join me.

05:24.005 --> 05:25.724
I'm from nowhere.

05:25.724 --> 05:27.715
- Kat.
- What?

05:27.715 --> 05:30.968
- She's tired, she's been
on the road all morning.

05:30.968 --> 05:32.635
- It's been a blast.

05:34.426 --> 05:37.509
(upbeat rock music)

05:44.211 --> 05:46.950
- Well nowhere girl, we're from Cape Town,

05:46.950 --> 05:49.700
escaping to our weekend hideaway.

05:51.574 --> 05:53.157
- You must be rich.

05:54.346 --> 05:56.464
- This is her car, she is rich.

05:56.464 --> 05:57.998
Aren't you babe.

05:57.998 --> 06:01.498
- Yes, Hugh, some producers do make money.

06:02.457 --> 06:04.151
- A producer.

06:04.151 --> 06:05.401
- I make films.

06:06.683 --> 06:07.683
- Like what?

06:08.587 --> 06:11.501
- Little films, TV commercials.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.334
- Oh.

06:13.501 --> 06:16.251
- And Hugh over here is an actor.

06:19.279 --> 06:23.516
- Love is forever or until
your wife cheats on you,

06:23.516 --> 06:28.219
then dial 0-800-Divorce,
for better, not worse.

06:28.219 --> 06:29.786
- He's done a couple of ads.

06:29.786 --> 06:31.634
But we're working on a movie project.

06:31.634 --> 06:34.394
He's going to be the star.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.013
- I could be an actress.

06:36.013 --> 06:37.958
Everyone said so.

06:37.958 --> 06:40.184
Even my friend Bubi,

06:40.184 --> 06:42.462
he said I could be the best
fucking actress in the world.

06:42.462 --> 06:43.295
- Booby?

06:43.295 --> 06:45.545
What kind of name is Bubi?

06:46.489 --> 06:49.279
- So do you make money, Hugh?

06:49.279 --> 06:50.592
And I've often wondered,

06:50.592 --> 06:53.034
as an actor how does one
know when you're acting

06:53.034 --> 06:54.618
and when you're for real?

06:54.618 --> 06:56.384
- Oh, he's not that good.

06:56.384 --> 06:57.257
- Hey!

06:57.257 --> 07:00.340
- What I mean is, I know him so well.

07:02.581 --> 07:03.914
How old are you?

07:05.405 --> 07:07.025
- How old are you?

07:07.025 --> 07:10.289
- You shouldn't hitchhike, at any age.

07:10.289 --> 07:12.617
- And you shouldn't pick up strangers.

09:04.588 --> 09:07.338
- Kathrine, let's leave her here.

09:08.232 --> 09:09.239
Hungry.

09:09.239 --> 09:10.072
And alone.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.108
- I know what.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.870
Come back to my place for lunch.

09:14.870 --> 09:17.732

we can bring her back.

09:17.732 --> 09:19.295

he's coming back this way

09:22.065 --> 09:23.316
in a couple of hours.

09:23.316 --> 09:25.399
- I don't need your help.

09:37.513 --> 09:39.232
- Look, I insist.

09:39.232 --> 09:41.708
I have this amazing little
house in the mountains

09:41.708 --> 09:43.875
with a little plunge pool.

09:45.766 --> 09:48.099
Come, see it, eat, cool off.

09:53.731 --> 09:55.465
Look, I don't know what
you're running from,

09:55.465 --> 09:56.588
and I don't care.

09:56.588 --> 09:58.268
It's your business.

09:58.268 --> 09:59.755
Just come have something to eat

09:59.755 --> 10:02.510
and then you can be on your way.

10:02.510 --> 10:06.518
Or I feel like I've failed in
my duty as a future mother.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.351

10:11.135 --> 10:11.968

Wimpie?

11:46.017 --> 11:46.850
- Wimpie!

11:49.746 --> 11:53.996
-  Christ, I
hope he's emptied the bins.

11:59.795 --> 12:00.982
Says he had to take his mother

12:00.982 --> 12:03.377
to the clinic all the way in Rietvlei.

12:03.377 --> 12:04.926
- I'm sure he'll be back on Monday.

12:04.926 --> 12:06.774
- Yeah, but what about the girl now?

12:06.774 --> 12:08.243

12:08.243 --> 12:09.648

12:09.648 --> 12:11.012
- Are you sure?

12:11.012 --> 12:12.168
-  Yeah, no problem.

12:12.168 --> 12:15.072
- Oh, that's very kind of you.

12:15.072 --> 12:17.572
- Hey, we're here, we made it.

12:21.113 --> 12:23.613
(eerie music)

12:26.970 --> 12:28.720
- We so need this.

12:30.342 --> 12:33.310
-  Now where's our crazy guest?

12:33.310 --> 12:34.143
- Liza?

12:37.279 --> 12:40.029
(birds chirping)

12:50.813 --> 12:53.783
(twigs snapping)

12:53.783 --> 12:55.283
What do you think?

12:56.590 --> 12:57.423
- Lovely.

12:59.098 --> 13:03.265
- Surrounded by nothing
except mountains and veld.

13:07.511 --> 13:08.344
- Nice.

13:09.443 --> 13:10.679
- Will you unpack?

13:10.679 --> 13:12.312
I don't want our things baking in the car.

13:12.312 --> 13:13.302
- Sure.

13:13.302 --> 13:14.552
- Thanks, babe.

13:15.459 --> 13:16.459
You like it?

13:17.572 --> 13:18.822
- I do.
- Come.

13:20.128 --> 13:21.878
I'll show you inside.

13:27.984 --> 13:31.401
This little house was once in a magazine.

13:32.952 --> 13:36.035
(eerie guitar music)

13:54.722 --> 13:57.055
I got it at a bargain price.

13:59.608 --> 14:02.525
I want it to be modern, but rustic.

14:06.563 --> 14:07.480
Eco-living.

14:19.518 --> 14:21.018
Christ it's dusty.

14:22.156 --> 14:23.855
-  Cute.

14:23.855 --> 14:25.918
- Oh sweetie, that's just decoration.

14:25.918 --> 14:26.751
(bells dings)

14:26.751 --> 14:30.084
(mournful guitar music)

14:39.529 --> 14:41.946
(Liza sighs)

14:43.917 --> 14:47.417
Classic, but with a minimal look and feel.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.261
- It must have cost you a lot.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.911
- I've fought my way up.

14:55.911 --> 14:58.587
Done things you couldn't imagine.

14:58.587 --> 15:01.508
But if you sacrifice
enough you can have it all.

15:01.508 --> 15:03.484
A car, a house or two, and--

15:03.484 --> 15:05.234
- A husband like him.

15:09.590 --> 15:11.474
- (laughs) Depending what
sins you've committed,

15:11.474 --> 15:12.557
Hugh's, Hugh!

15:15.680 --> 15:16.847
Careful, babe.

15:19.223 --> 15:21.973
(dramatic music)

15:23.235 --> 15:25.735
(Hugh groans)

15:27.459 --> 15:28.292
Klutz.

15:30.926 --> 15:31.926
Let me help.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.101
(twangy guitar music)

15:52.644 --> 15:55.315
(Liza sighs)

15:55.315 --> 15:58.815
I was going to wait, but since she's here.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.502
Cover your eyes.

16:02.377 --> 16:05.547
(bright music)

16:05.547 --> 16:07.380
Cover your eyes, Hugh.

16:12.211 --> 16:14.772
(paper crinkling)

16:14.772 --> 16:16.336
Okay, you can look.

16:16.336 --> 16:17.169
Surprise!

16:19.458 --> 16:20.458
You like it.

16:21.649 --> 16:23.167
- I love it.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.000
- Liza.

16:27.378 --> 16:31.963
It's by a famous artist,
Fanie du Toit, very expensive.

16:31.963 --> 16:33.546
Don't ask how much.

16:35.857 --> 16:36.690
150,000.

16:38.677 --> 16:41.094
- That much?
- I don't get it.

16:42.888 --> 16:43.888
- It's Hugh.

16:45.528 --> 16:47.662
Du Toit requires a refined eye.

16:47.662 --> 16:50.745
You have to be open minded, artistic.

16:55.929 --> 17:00.679
I'm gonna see if Wimpie's
cleared out the bins, excuse me.

17:03.286 --> 17:05.953
(both laughing)

17:10.828 --> 17:11.661
What?

17:12.575 --> 17:13.992
- Nothing.
- Hugh.

17:15.232 --> 17:16.315
Just tell me.

17:17.459 --> 17:19.209
- So, how's the pool?

17:26.435 --> 17:29.018
(gentle music)

17:36.649 --> 17:37.482
Lovely.

17:45.577 --> 17:47.569
- I have a spare costume that might fit.

17:47.569 --> 17:48.652
- No worries.

17:50.062 --> 17:52.645
(bright music)

18:06.535 --> 18:09.833
It's (speaking in foreign
language) come on in.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.750
- No, actually--
- Sure.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.514
- Oh lord.

18:24.217 --> 18:29.217
(gentle music)
(water gurgling)

18:30.803 --> 18:32.534
- Come, babe.

18:32.534 --> 18:35.201
(both laughing)

18:36.313 --> 18:38.896
(gentle music)

18:56.741 --> 18:59.135
- It's not that warm.

18:59.135 --> 19:00.385
- It's amazing.

19:01.427 --> 19:04.526
(speaking in foreign language)

19:04.526 --> 19:07.962
Okay, (speaking in foreign language).

19:07.962 --> 19:10.962
(Katherine sighing)

19:20.627 --> 19:23.294
(Liza laughing)

19:26.245 --> 19:27.747
- Hugh?

19:27.747 --> 19:29.201
- Oh!

19:29.201 --> 19:31.784
(all laughing)

19:36.933 --> 19:38.781
(all sighing)

19:38.781 --> 19:42.031
(upbeat country music)

20:45.488 --> 20:47.655
- You're our mystery girl.

20:49.615 --> 20:50.448
- I am.

20:51.282 --> 20:53.949
- Adds to your allure of course.

21:00.457 --> 21:03.207
(Kathrine sighs)

21:04.932 --> 21:08.738
So between you and me,
why were you hitchhiking.

21:08.738 --> 21:11.655
- Because I don't have a motorbike.

21:14.385 --> 21:16.591
- It's tough out there.

21:16.591 --> 21:18.591
It's hard to be alone.

21:18.591 --> 21:20.826
Travel alone I mean.

21:20.826 --> 21:21.826
-  Mm.

21:28.022 --> 21:28.855
- Babe?

21:50.683 --> 21:53.010
(Katherine sighs)

21:53.010 --> 21:54.822
You're the best.

21:54.822 --> 21:55.822
Legs please.

22:01.093 --> 22:02.431
Liza, I mean, I understand

22:02.431 --> 22:05.248
if some man was giving you a
hard time and you had to run.

22:05.248 --> 22:07.711
- Do I look like the type to run.

22:07.711 --> 22:10.945
- I'm not judging you for leaving.

22:10.945 --> 22:12.278
I ran away once.

22:13.651 --> 22:16.308
I think I was like you.

22:16.308 --> 22:17.891
- No one's like me.

22:19.045 --> 22:22.212
(gentle guitar music)

22:28.923 --> 22:31.106
- That's enough, thanks babe.

22:31.106 --> 22:31.939
- Sure.

22:35.378 --> 22:36.211
Liza?

22:37.899 --> 22:41.816
(speaking in foreign language)

22:42.801 --> 22:46.634
- You might not think
the sun effects you now.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.269
But when you're older.

23:02.294 --> 23:04.670
(Hugh yelling)

23:04.670 --> 23:07.253
(Hugh gasping)

23:51.492 --> 23:53.521
How's the meat looking?

23:53.521 --> 23:54.688
- Almost done.

24:18.010 --> 24:22.532
- Christ, the salad has
more dressing than she does.

24:22.532 --> 24:24.865
- Interesting girl.
- Oh yes?

24:26.324 --> 24:28.667
- She's quite a character.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.614
She'd be good in our movie.

24:31.614 --> 24:32.943
- I want her gone.

24:32.943 --> 24:33.776
- She's just a girl.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.006
- From nowhere.
- Exactly.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.506
That's why she needs our help.

24:38.832 --> 24:39.665
Listen.

24:40.682 --> 24:43.995
We'll give her lunch,
tell her to dress properly

24:43.995 --> 24:48.162
and I, or we can give her
a lift back to the road.

24:51.651 --> 24:54.818
- I'll bet you felt like quite a stud.

24:56.241 --> 24:59.824
- I am.
- Ouch. (laughing)

25:02.904 --> 25:03.737
Oh good.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.505
Our runaway's half decent again.

25:10.380 --> 25:11.979
Mm.

25:11.979 --> 25:14.562
(gentle music)

25:42.442 --> 25:45.012
- Now isn't this worth
sticking around for?

25:45.012 --> 25:48.929
(speaking in foreign language)

25:50.181 --> 25:52.721
Compliments to the salad queen.

25:52.721 --> 25:56.121
And this time, honey,
I remembered the beers.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.531
- But no bottle opener.

25:58.531 --> 25:59.614
- No problem.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.342
(cap clinking)

26:10.281 --> 26:11.864
- Here's to talent.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.969
- Getting away from it all.

26:15.969 --> 26:17.386
- And, surprises.

26:18.742 --> 26:20.379
Cheers.

26:20.379 --> 26:24.303
- (laughs) Babe, could you get me glass?

26:24.303 --> 26:26.886
(gentle music)

26:35.028 --> 26:37.528
(phone rings)

26:39.305 --> 26:40.638
-  Hello?

26:46.579 --> 26:49.162
(gentle music)

27:00.409 --> 27:02.059
- Was that the phone?

27:02.059 --> 27:04.698
- No, no, no the phone
lines are down again.

27:04.698 --> 27:07.117
Thank God, actually, no one

27:07.117 --> 27:09.538
from the office will bother us now.

27:09.538 --> 27:12.121
(gentle music)

27:19.990 --> 27:21.573
- Last bit, anyone?

27:34.334 --> 27:36.584
What on earth is she doing?

27:41.927 --> 27:43.177
- I don't know.

27:54.860 --> 27:57.277
(Liza sighs)

28:02.879 --> 28:04.661
- Why did you leave that meat out there?

28:04.661 --> 28:05.814
- For the animals.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.481
They also need to eat.

28:07.481 --> 28:09.162
- What animals?

28:09.162 --> 28:10.680
- Wild cat.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.552
- I don't think it's a good
idea to leave food out.

28:13.552 --> 28:14.969
- There are jackals.

28:17.232 --> 28:18.437
Mostly at night though.

28:18.437 --> 28:19.775
-  You'll attract baboons.

28:19.775 --> 28:21.488
- Maybe a leopard will come.

28:21.488 --> 28:23.071
- There're no leopards
around here, are there?

28:23.071 --> 28:24.223
- They are small leopards.

28:24.223 --> 28:26.859
Oupa Hennie had one on
his farm down the road.

28:26.859 --> 28:28.560
He wanted to poison it for taking sheep.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.887
But I said, (speaking
in foreign language),

28:29.887 --> 28:32.029
don't you dare harm it or
I will fucking kill you.

28:32.029 --> 28:34.802
So he listened, he left
it and it moved away.

28:34.802 --> 28:37.119
- So you are from around here?

28:37.119 --> 28:40.127
- I told you, I'm from nowhere.

28:40.127 --> 28:42.044
This is nowhere, right?

28:43.805 --> 28:47.245
- Since we picked you up,
we've come what, 60, 70Ks.

28:47.245 --> 28:48.328
- I guess so.

28:49.821 --> 28:51.654
- But where you going?

28:53.008 --> 28:55.275
- You don't always need a direction.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.454
Just see what happens.

28:57.454 --> 28:59.726
Like meeting you guys.

28:59.726 --> 29:01.085
- It's nice meeting to you too.

29:01.085 --> 29:02.655
No thank.

29:02.655 --> 29:04.383
So, you ready to leave?

29:04.383 --> 29:05.710
You have everything?

29:05.710 --> 29:07.536
- Everything I need's in my pack.

29:07.536 --> 29:09.150
- That's it?

29:09.150 --> 29:11.069
That's nothing.

29:11.069 --> 29:12.093
You need much more than a satchel

29:12.093 --> 29:14.843
to make it in the world, sweetie.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.557
- What do you think, Hugh?

29:22.176 --> 29:24.745
Think I have enough to make it?

29:24.745 --> 29:26.888
-  Yes, Hugh, tell us.

29:26.888 --> 29:30.841
- You've got attitude,
which probably helps.

29:30.841 --> 29:32.506
- And?

29:32.506 --> 29:35.019
- Lunch is over, let's go.

29:35.019 --> 29:36.662
- No rush.

29:36.662 --> 29:37.754
- Listen little girl.

29:37.754 --> 29:40.857
If you think long legs and hot
pants are gonna get you far

29:40.857 --> 29:43.320
in this world, you're very mistaken.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.641
- Everything's been fine so far.

29:45.641 --> 29:47.834
- Yeah, well looks fade.

29:47.834 --> 29:52.280
- I say, use what you've got,
while you've still got it.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.203
- You don't even know how dangerous it is.

29:54.203 --> 29:57.363
Hitching around wearing
practically nothing.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.280
- I said I can take care of myself.

30:02.778 --> 30:05.792
(gun thuds)

30:05.792 --> 30:07.038
- Hey, let go.

30:07.038 --> 30:07.904
- Give it, I've got it.

30:07.904 --> 30:09.453
- Oh, big deal, I want it.

30:09.453 --> 30:10.447
- Is it loaded?

30:10.447 --> 30:11.280
- Huh?

30:11.280 --> 30:12.525
- The gun, is it loaded?
- No.

30:12.525 --> 30:14.192
- So, let me see it.

30:15.968 --> 30:17.196
Uh huh.

30:17.196 --> 30:18.464
- Careful, I hate guns.

30:18.464 --> 30:19.919
- Bang.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.469
Bang.

30:21.469 --> 30:22.445
- Where'd you get it?

30:22.445 --> 30:25.504
- Oh, Bubi gave it to me for protection.

30:25.504 --> 30:26.337
- Pow.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.664
- Okay, give it back now.

30:29.664 --> 30:31.213
- Hang on.

30:31.213 --> 30:34.636
- Okay, I'll take it.
- It's my gun!

30:34.636 --> 30:37.327
- Bang, bang.
- Kathrine, stop.

30:37.327 --> 30:38.971
- Give it.
- No!

30:38.971 --> 30:40.335
- Give it!
- No!

30:40.335 --> 30:42.668
(gun fires)

30:46.146 --> 30:49.479
(dramatic guitar music)

30:52.576 --> 30:53.576
- Holy shit.

30:55.793 --> 30:58.225
- I didn't pull it, she did.

30:58.225 --> 30:59.534
- She squeezed my finger.

30:59.534 --> 31:00.557
(speaking in foreign language)

31:00.557 --> 31:02.770
- I thought you said it wasn't loaded.

31:02.770 --> 31:04.370
- I forgot.

31:04.370 --> 31:06.047
- I didn't mean to.

31:06.047 --> 31:09.441
It's just, it's got
quite a kick. (laughing)

31:09.441 --> 31:11.358
- It's just a damn gun.

31:12.786 --> 31:14.599
-  It's mine.

31:14.599 --> 31:18.599
- You'll get these back
when we get to the road.

31:19.788 --> 31:21.426
- Whatever.

31:21.426 --> 31:22.369
- I think we hit something.

31:22.369 --> 31:23.713
I heard a crack.

31:23.713 --> 31:26.134
-  You mean you hit something.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.695
- You see how dangerous guns are?

31:27.695 --> 31:29.969
Somebody could have got killed.

31:29.969 --> 31:32.034
- Someone always dies sooner or later.

31:32.034 --> 31:32.878
-  Really?

31:32.878 --> 31:34.623
Well have you shot anyone yet?

31:34.623 --> 31:36.496
- Not on purpose.
- What?

31:36.496 --> 31:38.352
- No, I'm joking.

31:38.352 --> 31:39.852
It was on purpose.

31:41.168 --> 31:42.835
- What's that smell?

31:44.585 --> 31:45.418
- Sulfur.

31:47.480 --> 31:50.505
It's from the gunpowder,
it hangs in the air.

31:50.505 --> 31:51.672
What a minute.

31:53.210 --> 31:54.369
Shit!
- What?

31:54.369 --> 31:57.202
(dramatic music)

32:03.022 --> 32:04.689
- Well done, ladies.

32:06.013 --> 32:07.786
We need to plug it.

32:07.786 --> 32:09.247
Someone find a plug.

32:09.247 --> 32:10.190
- Like what?

32:10.190 --> 32:12.357
- A plug, anything, hurry!

32:15.891 --> 32:18.224
- Good thing it didn't blow.

32:30.997 --> 32:31.830
Oh shit!

32:33.752 --> 32:36.502
(fire whooshing)

32:50.548 --> 32:51.381
(engine puttering)

32:51.381 --> 32:52.214
Ah.

32:56.278 --> 32:57.214
Shit.

32:57.214 --> 32:58.547
- Oh shit, what?

33:00.853 --> 33:03.910
- We're stuck until Sunday
when Wimpie returns.

33:03.910 --> 33:05.278
- Sunday?

33:05.278 --> 33:06.214
Can't you?

33:06.214 --> 33:09.147
- Can't I what?
- Phone someone?

33:09.147 --> 33:11.557
No, the lines are down.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.142
- There's no reception here either.

33:13.142 --> 33:14.907
-  No?

33:14.907 --> 33:16.436
- I'm sorry, Liza.

33:16.436 --> 33:18.362
You'll have to stay with us until then.

33:18.362 --> 33:20.610
(Liza sighs)

33:20.610 --> 33:22.527
- Cool, I like it here.

33:26.139 --> 33:29.346
- Great, our weekend
getaway now includes her.

33:29.346 --> 33:30.675
- That's fine.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.018
-  Yeah, as long
as she keeps her clothes on.

33:33.018 --> 33:37.101
- It's okay babe, there's
nothing to worry about.

33:38.542 --> 33:39.891
- All things considered, Hugh,

33:39.891 --> 33:41.029
you don't have a great track record.

33:41.029 --> 33:42.915
- Now that's not fair.

33:42.915 --> 33:45.133
- You're right, she's just a young woman

33:45.133 --> 33:48.138
and I invited her (groans).

33:48.138 --> 33:50.446
-  Hey, check this.

33:50.446 --> 33:52.356
- Check what?

33:52.356 --> 33:54.050
- It's gone.

33:54.050 --> 33:56.383
Something took it, the food.

34:02.544 --> 34:05.627
(gentle eerie music)

34:11.134 --> 34:13.717
(baboon howling)

34:25.096 --> 34:30.096
(Liza squealing)
(Liza laughing)

34:40.293 --> 34:42.876
(bright music)

34:50.839 --> 34:53.505
(bird chirping)

34:54.498 --> 34:57.581
(gentle eerie music)

35:11.912 --> 35:14.662
(chair creaking)

35:19.069 --> 35:21.065
- What the hell are you doing?

35:21.065 --> 35:23.370
- Characterization techniques.

35:23.370 --> 35:24.787
How to be badass.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.957
Man can have time, money or honey but--

35:31.957 --> 35:33.540
- Where did she go?

35:37.050 --> 35:40.800
- She went up there, I
wouldn't worry about it.

35:43.187 --> 35:44.187
- Hugh?
- Mm.

35:45.597 --> 35:46.946
- Is everything all right?

35:46.946 --> 35:47.779
- Yep.

35:49.193 --> 35:50.776
- You seem distant.

35:55.161 --> 35:57.994
- Just thinking about the project.

35:58.934 --> 35:59.767
- Fine.

36:05.396 --> 36:08.754
- How are the finances, or
shall I sell the painting?

36:08.754 --> 36:12.171
- Don't you dare, that was an investment.

36:15.793 --> 36:17.543
I'm going for a walk.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.772

36:21.772 --> 36:26.189
but never all three at once. (sighs)

37:52.743 --> 37:54.922
- Be careful.
- I'm fine.

37:54.922 --> 37:57.672
- I'm not, I'm afraid of heights.

37:58.751 --> 38:01.251
- What's down there?
- Nothing.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.848
A river or something.

38:03.848 --> 38:05.485
- Can I get down?

38:05.485 --> 38:07.861
- I think there's a path.

38:07.861 --> 38:10.904
I must say, it's amazing though.

38:10.904 --> 38:14.970
And here we come, making
a noise, starting fires.

38:14.970 --> 38:17.553
And this world hardly knows it.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.498
- It knows everything.

38:25.171 --> 38:27.157
You know, you were right.

38:27.157 --> 38:28.240
- About what?

38:29.135 --> 38:31.405
- There was a guy.
- Oh yes.

38:31.405 --> 38:32.405
- Mm, Bubi.

38:34.103 --> 38:39.103
I loved him but it became to
much, the fighting and stuff.

38:39.431 --> 38:41.178
So I split.

38:41.178 --> 38:42.761
Took what was mine.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.184
-  Mm, we've all been there.

38:46.184 --> 38:50.719
What about your folks,
why not go back to them?

38:50.719 --> 38:53.374
- Oh, they're gone.
- Gone?

38:53.374 --> 38:56.428
- To heaven, or hell (laughs).

38:56.428 --> 38:57.845
- I'm sorry.
- No.

38:59.576 --> 39:00.914
They hated Bubi.

39:00.914 --> 39:03.900
Some people aren't meant
to be together forever.

39:03.900 --> 39:08.546
Doesn't matter if they
love each other or not.

40:03.303 --> 40:04.386
So that's me.

40:05.874 --> 40:07.857
What about you?

40:07.857 --> 40:09.524
What's up with Hugh.

40:10.823 --> 40:14.711
- Every relationship has it's
high tides and it's low tides.

40:14.711 --> 40:16.746
Right now we're in a low tide.

40:16.746 --> 40:17.579
- Mm-hm.

40:18.671 --> 40:20.438
What's his problem?

40:20.438 --> 40:22.792
- He's emotionally illiterate.

40:22.792 --> 40:27.792
Hides his feelings, hides behind
his stupid project. (sighs)

40:33.614 --> 40:35.864
I will try to help him but.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.271
- Some men don't get it.

40:44.505 --> 40:48.117
- (laughs) Anyway, let's get going.

40:48.117 --> 40:51.215

us, what is going on?

42:36.560 --> 42:37.393
20,000.

42:39.064 --> 42:40.629
- How dare you.

42:40.629 --> 42:43.065
- Did you steal it?
- No.

42:43.065 --> 42:45.300
You've got a real nerve.

42:45.300 --> 42:46.656
-  Are you sure,
where did you get it then?

42:46.656 --> 42:48.490
- None of your fucking business.

- Liza, you have to tell
us, are you in trouble?

42:50.578 --> 42:51.514
- Is anyone looking for you?

42:51.514 --> 42:52.594
- I mean, are you on the run?

42:52.594 --> 42:56.160
- You can stay here, no one will find you.

42:56.160 --> 42:56.993
- No.
- No.

42:58.642 --> 43:01.037
- Okay.
- Hang on, hang on.

43:01.037 --> 43:04.454
I still want to know why you've got that.

43:06.721 --> 43:09.567
- It's all I have left from my parents.

43:09.567 --> 43:10.400
Happy?

43:11.367 --> 43:12.682
- No.

43:12.682 --> 43:16.765
Parents don't give their
daughters rolls of cash.

43:18.800 --> 43:19.717
- Mine did.

43:26.506 --> 43:28.923
(door bangs)

43:29.784 --> 43:32.478
-  What are you gonna do then?

43:32.478 --> 43:33.383
- Nothing.

43:33.383 --> 43:35.800
Wimpie will be back on Sunday.

43:37.378 --> 43:40.028
- Then we're taking her to the police.

43:40.028 --> 43:41.501
- Let's not get involved, okay,

43:41.501 --> 43:43.767
I'll take her back to the road somewhere.

43:43.767 --> 43:45.851
- She's got a gun.

43:45.851 --> 43:47.526
- And I've got the bullets.

43:47.526 --> 43:49.042
What do you think she's gonna do to us?

43:49.042 --> 43:51.125
She's just a little girl.

43:52.225 --> 43:54.696
- Can't you get the phone fixed somehow?

43:54.696 --> 43:57.989
- If the lines are down,
they're down, Kathrine.

43:57.989 --> 43:59.656

45:16.432 --> 45:18.050

45:18.050 --> 45:20.517
- Only if you promise
not to tell Kathrine,

45:20.517 --> 45:22.350
it will be our secret.

45:25.322 --> 45:26.822

- Hm.

45:52.182 --> 45:53.015
Thank you.

45:57.995 --> 46:02.218
- Kathrine, I think we
should discuss our project.

46:02.218 --> 46:03.440
-  That's work,

46:03.440 --> 46:06.127
I don't want to talk about work now.

46:06.127 --> 46:09.794

like to hear about it.

46:10.713 --> 46:11.880
-  Nope.

46:16.078 --> 46:19.987
-  Let's play a board game.

46:19.987 --> 46:23.747
What about poker, come,
you promised to teach me.

46:23.747 --> 46:26.414
- Strip poker, teasing, teasing.

46:27.896 --> 46:32.896
- (laughs) Well what do you suggest?

46:32.910 --> 46:34.493
- I'd love a joint.

46:35.359 --> 46:37.744
- Careful what you wish for.

46:37.744 --> 46:39.852
Ta-da (laughs).

46:39.852 --> 46:41.665
- Fantastics.

46:41.665 --> 46:43.585
- Hugh, no.
- What?

46:43.585 --> 46:46.593
Kathrine doesn't like
it when I smoke weed.

46:46.593 --> 46:47.926
- It's a hashie.

46:49.247 --> 46:52.509
(gentle music)

46:52.509 --> 46:53.872
- You said you'd give it up.

46:53.872 --> 46:56.462
Makes you silly, paranoid.

46:56.462 --> 46:57.962
- You don't smoke?

46:59.934 --> 47:01.663
- I've grown out of it.

47:01.663 --> 47:04.589
All right go on, make us dopey.

47:04.589 --> 47:06.256
- Feel the love mon.

47:07.786 --> 47:10.619
- I say, don't fight it, enjoy it.

47:23.074 --> 47:25.917
-  Do you smoke a lot?

47:25.917 --> 47:28.672
- No, I just do it occasionally.

47:28.672 --> 47:30.859
- Yeah, well it's illegal.

47:30.859 --> 47:33.025
- I don't care about stupid laws.

47:33.025 --> 47:35.073
- Society needs laws.

47:35.073 --> 47:37.490
-  Society's fucked up.

47:38.364 --> 47:40.572
- I love it when women argue.

47:40.572 --> 47:42.702
-  We're not arguing.

47:42.702 --> 47:45.068
- Oh, this is Hugh stoned.

47:45.068 --> 47:47.818
- Woman, they treat us like kids.

47:49.932 --> 47:51.565
-  Speak for yourself.

47:51.565 --> 47:53.229
- They think we're idiots.

47:53.229 --> 47:54.847
-  Men are idiots.

47:54.847 --> 47:57.215
- Everyone knows, men have two heads

47:57.215 --> 47:59.100
but only enough blood for one.

47:59.100 --> 48:01.850
-  You said it sister.

48:04.831 --> 48:07.164
- We can tell spook stories.

48:08.112 --> 48:09.980
Ghost stories.

48:09.980 --> 48:12.272
- From here?
- Yes of course.

48:12.272 --> 48:13.422
They are ghosts here.

48:13.422 --> 48:16.422
- I don't think I want to here this.

48:18.224 --> 48:21.689
- There's this famous one
about this hitchhiker girl.

48:21.689 --> 48:25.264
Gets on a motorbike on
a long lonely night.

48:25.264 --> 48:26.911
- No stop, Liza.

48:26.911 --> 48:31.088
- But when the motorbike
stops, the girl's gone.

48:31.088 --> 48:33.978

(women laughing)

48:33.978 --> 48:36.336

48:36.336 --> 48:38.029
- That's my cue.

48:38.029 --> 48:38.862
I'm going.

48:40.780 --> 48:42.863
-  Where you going?

48:43.743 --> 48:45.949
- I'm going to have a bath.

48:45.949 --> 48:47.532
Outside.
- What now?

48:48.846 --> 48:53.520
- I want to bathe in the
discontent of modern life.

48:53.520 --> 48:56.520
(Kathrine laughing)

48:58.014 --> 49:01.599
And spend time thinking about my project.

49:01.599 --> 49:03.849

49:06.258 --> 49:08.190
- Oh (laughs) he's funny.

49:08.190 --> 49:10.857

49:33.668 --> 49:35.605

- Hm?

49:35.605 --> 49:36.772
-  That.

49:39.276 --> 49:41.254
-  Oh God.

49:41.254 --> 49:42.645
Must have fallen out of one of the books.

49:42.645 --> 49:43.918

49:43.918 --> 49:47.398

49:47.398 --> 49:48.619
-  She's pretty.

49:48.619 --> 49:51.259
- Yeah, well don't judge her by her looks.

49:51.259 --> 49:52.426
So depressing.

49:53.678 --> 49:55.761
No warmth, no tenderness.

49:58.126 --> 50:00.113
Drinking when she couldn't handle life.

50:00.113 --> 50:01.696
And now she's gone.

50:03.270 --> 50:04.998
- I'm sorry.

50:04.998 --> 50:08.502
I'm sure she's watching you from heaven.

50:08.502 --> 50:11.137
- (laughs) Unlikely.

50:11.137 --> 50:13.652
She used to make me go to
Sunday School every week.

50:13.652 --> 50:14.499
She was always going on

50:14.499 --> 50:17.444
about the Father, the
Son and the Holy Ghost.

50:17.444 --> 50:19.476
Not that it helped her either.

50:19.476 --> 50:20.654
Oh God.

50:20.654 --> 50:22.757
Where's that joint.

50:22.757 --> 50:24.118
- I believe.

50:24.118 --> 50:28.285
In the Mother, the Daughter
and the Holy Ghostess.

50:31.009 --> 50:32.901
You ever have a blow back?

50:32.901 --> 50:34.234
-  No.

50:35.713 --> 50:38.463

51:03.932 --> 51:05.515

51:06.616 --> 51:09.120
There will never be equality for women

51:09.120 --> 51:12.287
as long as the Almighty is the Father.

51:18.805 --> 51:20.722
It's all men's fault.

51:22.418 --> 51:24.335
I know stuff.
- You do?

51:27.921 --> 51:29.838

51:30.802 --> 51:32.274
- They have their uses.

51:32.274 --> 51:34.941
(both laughing)

51:39.395 --> 51:41.507

51:41.507 --> 51:43.235
-  What?

51:43.235 --> 51:45.068
- Leave him.
- Why?

51:46.198 --> 51:49.115
We're planning to have a family together.

51:50.037 --> 51:51.027
Do you know that I bought this house

51:51.027 --> 51:53.610
because I thought he'd like it.

51:54.496 --> 51:56.390
- He's wrong for you.

51:56.390 --> 51:58.609
- You don't know me.

51:58.609 --> 52:02.276
Besides, I can take
care of myself and Hugh.

52:03.508 --> 52:08.148
I already saved him from
one terrible relationship.

52:08.148 --> 52:09.731
-  And these?

52:10.836 --> 52:14.950
-  Oh, those
were here when we moved in.

52:14.950 --> 52:16.450
- I heard a noise.

52:17.766 --> 52:18.849
- What noise?

52:20.164 --> 52:20.997
(Liza growling)

52:20.997 --> 52:22.270
(Kathrine laughing)

52:22.270 --> 52:24.177
- It's the munchies.

52:24.177 --> 52:25.344
Any leftovers?

52:26.417 --> 52:27.936
- Help yourself.

52:27.936 --> 52:28.936
- Sweet, ah.

52:30.803 --> 52:33.386
(gentle music)

52:49.987 --> 52:52.987
(crickets chirping)

53:12.359 --> 53:15.109
(water dripping)

53:27.567 --> 53:28.400
Ow.

53:33.780 --> 53:35.137
-  What?

53:35.137 --> 53:36.562
- Oh, nothing.

53:36.562 --> 53:37.395
Oops.

53:38.783 --> 53:40.065
- Oh.

53:40.065 --> 53:40.898
(Katherine's throat clearing)

53:40.898 --> 53:42.339
Did you find enough to eat?

53:42.339 --> 53:44.178
- Yes, thanks.

53:44.178 --> 53:45.011
And, this.

53:47.284 --> 53:50.288
-  I think that's Wimpie's.

53:50.288 --> 53:54.355
(sultry jazzy music)
(both laughing)

53:54.355 --> 53:55.522
- Come, dance.

54:59.881 --> 55:01.764

55:01.764 --> 55:05.823
- (laughs) I knew this one guy once,

55:05.823 --> 55:08.079
he was married to this crazy bitch.

55:08.079 --> 55:09.865

55:09.865 --> 55:12.448

57:09.420 --> 57:11.361
- I'm sure it was an accident.

57:11.361 --> 57:13.861
- Of course it was, I'm sorry.

57:14.764 --> 57:16.140
- I could have broken my neck.

57:16.140 --> 57:17.880
- Okay, easy ladies,
everything's okay now.

57:17.880 --> 57:20.503
-  Shivering.
(Hugh and Liza laughing)

57:20.503 --> 57:22.343
What you think this is funny?

57:22.343 --> 57:25.042
-  Let me go inside
and run you a hot bath.

57:25.042 --> 57:27.303
Okay, you'll feel much better.

57:27.303 --> 57:30.720
And I'll make you a brandy, a strong one.

57:45.086 --> 57:47.919
(water splashing)

58:39.640 --> 58:42.390
(door squeaking)

59:02.185 --> 59:03.980
- Babe?
- Yeah.

59:03.980 --> 59:05.147
- Still awake?

59:08.854 --> 59:09.937
Come to Mama.

59:13.563 --> 59:14.396
Hugh?

59:15.372 --> 59:17.177
- I'm not in the mood.

59:17.177 --> 59:21.594
- You're always in the mood. (sighs)

59:22.540 --> 59:27.540
Christ you want a headache tablet.

59:28.007 --> 59:30.389
It's her, isn't it.
- No.

59:30.389 --> 59:32.504
- She's fucking with you, you know that.

59:32.504 --> 59:35.145
She's fucking with both of us.

59:35.145 --> 59:36.263
- What?

59:36.263 --> 59:37.096
How?

59:39.382 --> 59:41.016
- Wake up, Hugh.

59:41.016 --> 59:45.065
All this, I'll show you my
underwear, I'll tan topless.

59:45.065 --> 59:47.982
I'm sorry, Kathrine, it's bullshit.

59:49.033 --> 59:51.542
She's a stupid little girl.

59:51.542 --> 59:53.702
It doesn't help that you encourage her.

59:53.702 --> 59:54.994
- I don't.

59:54.994 --> 59:57.364
- Well you don't discourage her.

59:57.364 --> 59:59.347
I swear if she tries to her
silly little stunt again,

59:59.347 --> 01:00:01.031
I'll throttle her.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.409
Both of you.

01:00:02.409 --> 01:00:04.201
- Who's psycho now.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:07.284
- Yes, well it takes one to know one.

01:00:13.128 --> 01:00:13.961
Where's the key?

01:00:13.961 --> 01:00:15.211
- I don't know.

01:00:16.437 --> 01:00:17.764
I'm sure there was one.

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:20.435
- Just chill, Kathrine.

01:00:20.435 --> 01:00:21.768
- I can't chill.

01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:29.762
What is it with you?

01:00:29.762 --> 01:00:31.460
Just tell me, please.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.564
- I'm just thinking.

01:00:32.564 --> 01:00:34.788
- About?
- It's nothing.

01:00:34.788 --> 01:00:38.371
- Oh, fuck's sake. (sighs)

01:00:44.132 --> 01:00:45.049
- Honestly.

01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:48.356
Do you think I'm a good actor?

01:00:48.356 --> 01:00:51.106
- Totally self-absorbed, but yes.

01:00:52.354 --> 01:00:54.517
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:56.949
I think you're a phenomenal actor.

01:00:56.949 --> 01:00:59.721
- Really?
- You know me, babe.

01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:04.226
I've always been there and with
our little project together,

01:01:04.226 --> 01:01:07.298
you're going to be amazing.

01:01:07.298 --> 01:01:08.750
- You'll make it happen for me?

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:09.583
- I will.

01:01:12.434 --> 01:01:15.875
- (sighs) Because I just don't
know when I'm acting anymore.

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:18.900
It's like I've forgotten how
to be truthful with myself.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.052
- What?

01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:22.048
You see it is her.

01:01:22.048 --> 01:01:24.752
Those were her words in the car.

01:01:24.752 --> 01:01:26.096
You're letting her get to you.

01:01:26.096 --> 01:01:28.116
And now you're having a
fucking midlife crisis

01:01:28.116 --> 01:01:30.386
at 35 because of her.

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:34.132
God, I lock the door
and she still gets in.

01:01:34.132 --> 01:01:35.680
- Stop freaking out, Kat.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.328
- She's a criminal, Hugh,
on the run, I'm sure of it.

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:42.627
Look, I can't believe
you're taking her side.

01:01:42.627 --> 01:01:46.294
I mean, just how bad
does a girl have to be?

01:01:49.295 --> 01:01:50.378
- Really bad.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.223
(gentle music)

01:02:24.432 --> 01:02:27.182
(Kathrine sighs)

01:02:28.976 --> 01:02:33.976
(dramatic ominous music)
(dog whining)

01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:05.211
(water gurgling)

01:03:11.518 --> 01:03:12.435
- Kathrine.

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:16.243
Come to my side.

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.397
- Who are you?

01:03:32.456 --> 01:03:34.039
Who are you really?

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.461
- Don't you know?

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.717
Sometimes you need a little
darkness to see the light.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:46.717
(electricity sizzling)
(gun clicking)

01:03:49.227 --> 01:03:51.977
(birds chirping)

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.550
(dramatic eerie music)

01:05:02.667 --> 01:05:05.417
(birds chirping)

01:05:13.528 --> 01:05:15.611
- Hey, I heard something.

01:05:17.577 --> 01:05:20.056
I thought you were an intruder.

01:05:20.056 --> 01:05:24.723
- (laughs) You get many intruders here?

01:05:26.827 --> 01:05:29.077
- It's beautiful, isn't it.

01:05:30.136 --> 01:05:34.345
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:34.345 --> 01:05:36.311
What are you thinking?

01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:40.408
- (groans) Just, thinking
about my man, Bubi.

01:05:40.408 --> 01:05:42.473
-  What's he like?

01:05:42.473 --> 01:05:44.427
- Nothing like you.

01:05:44.427 --> 01:05:45.801
- What does that mean?

01:05:45.801 --> 01:05:50.234
- (laughs) Nothing, I'm
just messing with you.

01:05:50.234 --> 01:05:52.248
Please don't take me too seriously.

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:53.748
I'm a mind fucker.

01:05:56.856 --> 01:05:58.955
(eerie music)

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.872
(Kathrine sighing)

01:06:07.995 --> 01:06:11.162
(bright upbeat music)

01:06:17.283 --> 01:06:19.866
-  Liza, a girl like you.

01:06:21.233 --> 01:06:22.566
- What about me?

01:06:23.682 --> 01:06:26.050
- Well have you thought about acting?

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.553
I mean, you've got something, character.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:33.970
- And let me guess, you'd
like to be my acting coach.

01:06:35.697 --> 01:06:40.322
So I can also be a faker,
pretending to be what I'm not.

01:06:40.322 --> 01:06:43.228
- I don't pretend, I'm a serious actor.

01:06:43.228 --> 01:06:45.438
- Ah, I'm sorry Hugh.

01:06:45.438 --> 01:06:47.311
Has it been rough?
- Has what?

01:06:47.311 --> 01:06:49.709
- You know, breaking in,

01:06:49.709 --> 01:06:52.792
getting known, finishing the project.

01:06:53.967 --> 01:06:55.384
- It will happen.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:59.407
- Hm, if you want something too much

01:06:59.407 --> 01:07:01.657
it eats you up from inside.

01:07:07.121 --> 01:07:09.856
So what about your acting career?

01:07:09.856 --> 01:07:12.783
Mm, what about sex scenes?

01:07:12.783 --> 01:07:14.848
Won't Katherine get jealous?

01:07:14.848 --> 01:07:17.280
She seems like the type.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.734
Or does she love you now matter what?

01:07:20.734 --> 01:07:22.734
- Katherine understands.

01:07:23.926 --> 01:07:27.343
A kiss between real actors means nothing.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.862
- A kiss means nothing, really?

01:07:47.642 --> 01:07:52.142
You're right, I felt nothing. (sighs)

01:07:54.396 --> 01:07:55.229
Oh look.

01:07:57.097 --> 01:07:57.930
Stay.

01:08:07.193 --> 01:08:09.628
- What the hell is going on here?

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:12.774
- We're just having
such a nice, open talk.

01:08:12.774 --> 01:08:14.522
- I was teaching her about acting.

01:08:14.522 --> 01:08:15.793
- Yeah, that too.

01:08:15.793 --> 01:08:17.423
- And that means kissing him.

01:08:17.423 --> 01:08:20.265
That's not how you treat people, Liza.

01:08:20.265 --> 01:08:23.196
I brought you here to help you.

01:08:23.196 --> 01:08:25.640
I thought you'd at least
be a little grateful.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.850
- You brought me here to show off.

01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:30.249
- You little runaway shit.

01:08:30.249 --> 01:08:32.139
- You know, you're like
one of those people

01:08:32.139 --> 01:08:34.214
who give a big donation at the church

01:08:34.214 --> 01:08:37.481
and then make a noise
about it so everyone knows.

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:38.970
- Okay, Liza, stop.

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:39.803
It wasn't a big deal.

01:08:39.803 --> 01:08:41.513
- Oh shut up, both of you.

01:08:41.513 --> 01:08:44.777
- No, do you really love him
or just that kak picture.

01:08:44.777 --> 01:08:46.858
- I want you gone.

01:08:46.858 --> 01:08:48.941
- Don't worry, I'm going.

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:52.665
You know, I was trying to help.

01:08:52.665 --> 01:08:56.041
-  You (laughs) help me.

01:08:56.041 --> 01:08:57.448
- Yes.

01:08:57.448 --> 01:08:58.866
But now I'm gone.

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:01.660
- Hey, where you gonna go?

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:02.761
We're miles from the road.

01:09:02.761 --> 01:09:06.594
- I already told you, I
can look after myself.

01:09:08.764 --> 01:09:11.017
- Kathrine, just calm down.

01:09:11.017 --> 01:09:14.100
- Fucking actors, fucking bad actors.

01:09:16.026 --> 01:09:19.593
- Oh, that's rich, okay, Kathrine, fine.

01:09:19.593 --> 01:09:20.426
- You know what?

01:09:20.426 --> 01:09:21.513
Man up, Hugh.

01:09:21.513 --> 01:09:23.689
You act all strong and calm

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:25.096
but if you weren't so scared of a fight,

01:09:25.096 --> 01:09:28.906
if you weren't such wuss we
wouldn't be in this mess.

01:09:28.906 --> 01:09:30.024
- This mess?

01:09:30.024 --> 01:09:31.357
- Yes, Hugh, us.

01:09:33.404 --> 01:09:35.237
- What are you saying?

01:09:36.122 --> 01:09:38.635
- I don't think I can do this anymore.

01:09:38.635 --> 01:09:39.551
No more us.

01:09:40.711 --> 01:09:42.567
And no more movie either.

01:09:42.567 --> 01:09:44.984
It was never going to happen.

01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:51.115
(dramatic music)

01:09:51.115 --> 01:09:52.865
- Honey, you need me.

01:09:54.396 --> 01:09:56.649
Okay, I'm gonna go inside
to try to fix the phone

01:09:56.649 --> 01:09:58.889
to call someone to sort out the car.

01:09:58.889 --> 01:10:03.222
In the meantime, we're all
gonna calm the fuck down.

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:16.135
- Hey!

01:10:16.135 --> 01:10:17.635
Hey, psycho bitch!

01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:20.664
Where'd it go?

01:10:20.664 --> 01:10:21.980
My gun.

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.499
- I'm making sure you leave.

01:10:23.499 --> 01:10:24.906
- Kathrine, don't mess around.

01:10:24.906 --> 01:10:26.460
- Step back Hugh, it's loaded.

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.106
- No I've taken out the bullets.

01:10:28.106 --> 01:10:31.132
- No, darling, I put more in.

01:10:31.132 --> 01:10:32.312
- Kathrine!

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:34.409
- Time to go, devil child.

01:10:34.409 --> 01:10:36.585
Hey!
- Kathrine stop.

01:10:36.585 --> 01:10:37.737
- I've had it with her.

01:10:37.737 --> 01:10:39.546
Why are you defending her?

01:10:39.546 --> 01:10:41.018
- What's gotten into you,

01:10:41.018 --> 01:10:43.258
take those bullets out
and give that back to her.

01:10:43.258 --> 01:10:45.771
- What, what, you trust her with a gun?

01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:47.516
She's the devil, Hugh.

01:10:47.516 --> 01:10:48.970
In my dream I saw her.

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.637
I saw you too, dead.

01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:53.851
- You're really losing it.

01:10:53.851 --> 01:10:56.779
- Liza, out of my house, now.

01:10:56.779 --> 01:10:57.638
-  Coming.

01:10:57.638 --> 01:10:59.113
- Hey, put that down!

01:10:59.113 --> 01:11:00.446
Hugh, stop her!

01:11:01.788 --> 01:11:02.748
Where's she going!

01:11:02.748 --> 01:11:04.698
- Put down the gun.
- No!

01:11:04.698 --> 01:11:05.756
Back off.

01:11:05.756 --> 01:11:07.581
- What the hell's got into you?

01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:09.133
(ominous vocalizing)

01:11:09.133 --> 01:11:10.633

01:11:33.278 --> 01:11:34.195
- Kathrine!

01:11:36.077 --> 01:11:38.047
Kathrine, come back now.

01:11:38.047 --> 01:11:40.385

Liza, tell us where you
really got that money.

who didn't need it anymore.

- And why didn't they need it?

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.995

01:13:23.489 --> 01:13:24.676

01:13:24.676 --> 01:13:26.009

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:08.293

01:15:08.293 --> 01:15:09.978

Now just come and help

just call you know who.
