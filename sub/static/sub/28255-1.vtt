WEBVTT

03:50.283 --> 03:53.408
He played very quietly, as I remember,

03:53.433 --> 03:57.556
it had so much variety and nuance.

03:57.581 --> 04:01.986
He hypnotized his audience

04:02.011 --> 04:04.860
with the depth of his interpretation.

06:19.802 --> 06:23.310
I think in the case of Schnabel,
his music is interesting,

06:23.335 --> 06:25.560
but it is not performed.

06:32.536 --> 06:36.395
I heard about his composition

06:36.420 --> 06:40.020
that it had a certain
amount of dissonance

06:40.045 --> 06:45.303
and that it had nothing to do or little
to do with the music he performed.

06:47.146 --> 06:50.881
His music had a character of its own.

06:50.906 --> 06:56.043
I cannot say that it reminds
me of anybody else's music.

06:56.068 --> 06:58.653
It's in a sense very strange music.

08:56.210 --> 08:59.226
We seem to search for the meaning

08:59.251 --> 09:04.173
of life and existence by
trying to get down into

09:04.198 --> 09:09.858
the smallest possible
dimension or element.

09:13.155 --> 09:16.741
And music as espoused by Schnabel

09:17.398 --> 09:20.319
went in the other direction, he went

09:20.344 --> 09:23.444
to the universal, to the cosmic.

09:30.358 --> 09:33.397
I would say the words
that come to mind are:

09:34.733 --> 09:37.530
Drama, architecture,

09:37.555 --> 09:39.851
theatre, contrast.

09:50.085 --> 09:53.546
He really opened up one's awareness

09:53.571 --> 09:57.507
of the dimensions that we all possess.

09:57.532 --> 10:02.298
He kind of gave us a key to access

10:03.360 --> 10:05.305
those dimensions.

11:30.570 --> 11:34.273
He regarded himself as a modernist

11:34.307 --> 11:40.119
and he had certain kinds of theories, not
written down like Schönberg's theories,

11:40.144 --> 11:42.758
but of what music should sound like.

12:39.055 --> 12:43.906
Schnabel was being fated as a
pianist, as an interpreter.

12:43.946 --> 12:48.570
He thought of himself as a composer
first and a pianist second.

12:48.837 --> 12:52.602
I think composers, particularly those who
felt they were composing for themselves

12:54.274 --> 12:58.054
decided that they would no longer pay
attention to what the musical trends were.

12:58.079 --> 13:00.570
They didn't feel like they had to conform.

14:59.501 --> 15:01.337
Vienna, at the turn of the century.

15:01.362 --> 15:07.094
We ended up with this strange
bastion of old German music.

15:07.962 --> 15:13.001
There was one dominant
figure in music in Vienna,

15:13.026 --> 15:15.836
and that man was Johannes Brahms.

15:44.782 --> 15:46.149
I think if he stayed in Vienna,

15:46.174 --> 15:48.625
he would have become a very
different sort of composer.

23:50.361 --> 23:54.908
The music that he wrote
was a very direct line

23:54.933 --> 23:58.667
through Mahler, through
Strauss, down to today,

23:58.696 --> 24:02.578
through second Viennese School.

24:23.789 --> 24:26.813
The passion with which they are filled,

24:26.838 --> 24:34.764
they are atonal, you are quite moved
by the sense of force behind them.

24:34.789 --> 24:38.225
That was part of his
mission as a composer.

31:53.749 --> 31:57.491
I read the letter that
his mother wrote to him.

31:57.516 --> 32:01.897
And she was in one of those
"Sammellager“ in Vienna

32:01.922 --> 32:04.609
and from there wrote him a letter

32:05.469 --> 32:08.922
in very, very elegant German.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.718
She asked him for money,

32:13.743 --> 32:20.993
because in that camp she
needed to pay for the laundry

32:21.018 --> 32:26.379
of her billing,
for her sheets and so on,

32:26.404 --> 32:28.958
and she didn't have the
money to pay for that.

34:46.656 --> 34:49.898
So many people, who were Jewish,
deluded themselves

34:49.923 --> 34:55.582
that a little water on their
head makes them Germans

34:55.607 --> 34:57.098
or non-Jewish.

38:21.997 --> 38:26.661
Ever changing lights,
the changing colours of the lakes,

38:26.686 --> 38:30.051
or the different greens
of the mountains, and

38:30.076 --> 38:34.246
that must have been very inspirational to
him. I certainly hear it in his music.

43:28.762 --> 43:29.778
Virginia...

43:30.715 --> 43:33.004
Well, let's say they were very intimate.

43:35.684 --> 43:38.652
And, in fact, when I wanted
Schnabel to know something

43:38.677 --> 43:40.660
and I was afraid to tell him,

43:40.685 --> 43:41.926
I would tell her.

44:51.683 --> 44:55.222
He did accept me as a student,

44:55.249 --> 44:58.975
to work with him in
his home in Tremezzo.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.530
He was very demanding,

45:04.563 --> 45:09.755
he was never in the least destructive,
always supportive.

45:16.833 --> 45:18.208
He was a great teacher,

45:18.233 --> 45:22.755
but different from what people
usually think of as a great teacher,

45:22.780 --> 45:26.505
because what he was
interested in was the music,

45:27.091 --> 45:30.810
not the way you wiggle your fingers.

45:31.521 --> 45:34.849
In fact, he said once:

45:34.874 --> 45:37.052
"I don't teach the piano.

45:37.077 --> 45:39.325
Does the carpenter teach the hammer?"

46:25.505 --> 46:28.731
After ten years he kicked me out:

46:29.122 --> 46:32.427
"You now have to go out and
make your own mistakes.

46:32.452 --> 46:36.722
You know enough how to
search for the answers.

46:36.747 --> 46:40.073
Not you know enough
to know the answers.

46:40.393 --> 46:44.729
But you know enough now how
to look for the answers"

48:36.284 --> 48:38.338
He was inspired by love and beauty.

48:38.636 --> 48:43.042
And his life was complicated
by war and exile.

48:43.339 --> 48:47.698
And one can hear the
complexities of his life

48:47.723 --> 48:49.667
and the complexities of his music.

48:49.695 --> 48:53.078
And that's what fascinates
me about Artur Schnabel.

48:57.563 --> 48:59.540
No one is the absolute authority,

48:59.565 --> 49:02.438
no one really can say
with absolute certainty

49:02.463 --> 49:06.172
what will live into the 22nd century,
to the 23rd century.

49:06.197 --> 49:11.797
Through re-performing the work and
interpreting it very, very strongly,

49:12.071 --> 49:15.891
in the end, a work, all works
deserve to have a very -

49:15.916 --> 49:18.000
the strongest argument possible.

49:35.098 --> 49:36.622
Whatever I am,

49:36.647 --> 49:43.028
primarily has been stoked
and nurtured by him.

49:43.053 --> 49:45.645
I feel myself very much a

49:46.958 --> 49:49.106
a creature of his...

49:50.559 --> 49:51.903
creation.
