WEBVTT

00:13.600 --> 00:15.320
Look, Paula's markers,

00:15.400 --> 00:17.400
with chewed up caps,
like you used to do.

00:17.480 --> 00:18.720
Thanks, Mom. Give me one.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.800
So, on the day of our first date
I arrived 25 minutes early.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.600
I called him and he said

00:25.680 --> 00:27.600
he was heading out right then.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.600
See you soon.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.040
We met

00:30.840 --> 00:32.160
here, at Hanoi.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.680
He walked there
and it only took five to seven minutes.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.240
Pity, for once you land a good guy...
Why do you want to know how long it took?

00:41.520 --> 00:43.880
To know how far away
from the cafeteria he was.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.400
DISTANCE WALKING 5 TO 7 MINS

00:45.480 --> 00:46.320
500 MTS APPROX.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.280
In that time frame he could have
traveled 500 meters at best.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.280
More or less.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.080
his hideout

00:58.160 --> 00:59.280
is in this area.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.520
He took one of these streets
to get to the cafeteria.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.920
I'm sure one of the surveillance cameras
taped it.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.240
I have to narrow it down.
Give me another one.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.360
I'll get the recordings
from that area

01:14.440 --> 01:16.080
to figure out the route he took.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.560
Are you sure of this?

01:21.120 --> 01:21.960
Mom,

01:23.240 --> 01:25.400
I'll find him no matter what it takes.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.360
Be careful, dear.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.760
We have a badly injured man.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.840
Three gunshots in the abdomen
and it's been a few hours.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.120
Where is he?

02:03.320 --> 02:05.560
I don't know how long
before I get him out.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.520
And listen,

02:07.600 --> 02:09.600
the police are tracking me down.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.080
Is it safe for them?

02:13.360 --> 02:15.880
They already know
and they agreed to their part.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.800
Yours would be ten million.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.960
I need abdominal laparotomy gear,

02:23.200 --> 02:26.240
a medical ventilator
and surgical equipment.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.400
Can you get it?

02:29.000 --> 02:29.960
I'll take care of it.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.920
WEDNESDAY
09:36 AM

02:41.800 --> 02:44.560
14 HOURS
SINCE THE SHOOTOUT

02:52.640 --> 02:54.720
Good morning. Inspector Murillo.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.320
I need the footage from the cameras
from October 23rd.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.600
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.000
Bye.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.680
Thank you.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.720
Did you find out anything yet?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.240
I'm starting to draw

04:56.960 --> 04:58.800
the route he took to the cafeteria.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.520
Look, that narrows the area down

05:02.880 --> 05:04.760
to this triangle.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.720
If he went to Hanoi this way,

05:08.480 --> 05:10.640
His hideout is very close, in this area.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.120
I have to go out again, mom.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.840
The bulk of the calls were made
from this area.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.560
So the Professor must have
used these streets.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.880
Check the surveillance tapes
from this area.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.920
Get the judge to issue a warrant.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.920
This is headquarters...

06:53.040 --> 06:54.200
I told the kid.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.520
Told him what?

07:01.720 --> 07:02.600
What I did to you.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.320
That I abandoned you
at that roundabout in Martorell.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.560
I went back to that roundabout,

07:14.720 --> 07:15.600
because...

07:16.280 --> 07:18.480
I dreamed that you were
cleaning windshields

07:18.760 --> 07:19.960
at that stop light.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.080
I took the car

07:24.760 --> 07:25.640
and drove.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.880
Hours and hours,

07:30.240 --> 07:31.880
because I wanted to fix

07:32.640 --> 07:33.520
my mistake.

07:36.040 --> 07:36.920
Don't speak.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.480
-Rest.
-I showed your picture

07:41.200 --> 07:42.960
to everyone who passed by.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.280
And now...

07:51.160 --> 07:52.040
your son...

07:55.160 --> 07:56.360
told me he hates me.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.840
Your son

08:03.720 --> 08:04.600
adores you.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.600
No matter what he says
in the heat of the moment.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.280
I know he doesn't hate you.

08:13.800 --> 08:14.960
Well, I deserve it.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.080
I took his mother from him.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.200
No.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.600
No, you did great.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.880
You have a wonderful son.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.760
Strong.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.120
Noble.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.040
And that...

08:39.720 --> 08:40.840
that's thanks to you.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.360
I did what I could, honey...

08:48.160 --> 08:49.840
He came out a little nuts, didn't he?

08:59.080 --> 08:59.960
I have never

09:00.680 --> 09:01.680
been as happy

09:03.560 --> 09:04.800
as the day I met you.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.960
If I have to go to some place now,

09:13.800 --> 09:15.160
I'd like it to be that one.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.480
The village festival.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.280
And dance with you,

09:25.120 --> 09:26.040
together

09:28.400 --> 09:29.360
with the lights.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.440
With the colorful lights.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.720
I love you.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.600
I'm sorry.

09:39.000 --> 09:39.880
Forgive me.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.800
Forgive me.

10:03.080 --> 10:03.920
I'm sorry.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.240
I'm sorry.

10:09.800 --> 10:10.920
I'm sorry.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.440
I'm so sorry.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.400
-What are you doing?
-Listen!

13:24.480 --> 13:25.400
Do you hear that?

13:26.800 --> 13:27.760
It's them!

13:27.880 --> 13:29.520
-It's them.
-How much is left?

13:29.640 --> 13:30.960
30 or 40 centimeters.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.640
Come on. Let's go!

13:33.280 --> 13:34.200
Hey!

13:35.040 --> 13:35.880
Hey!

13:36.160 --> 13:37.280
Professor!

13:54.200 --> 13:56.160
We're here!

13:58.440 --> 13:59.320
They're here.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.680
They're here!

14:01.320 --> 14:02.240
Hey!

14:02.840 --> 14:03.720
They're here!

14:06.320 --> 14:07.680
They're right there!

14:07.800 --> 14:08.880
One more!

14:09.200 --> 14:10.160
One more!

14:10.480 --> 14:11.520
Professor!

15:06.120 --> 15:08.520
You're going to get ink on the wall, dear.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.520
Mom,

15:09.800 --> 15:11.120
where are your car keys?

15:11.400 --> 15:13.680
That car hasn't been used
for a long time, dear.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.480
Well, it's about time

15:15.720 --> 15:16.800
we take it for a spin.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.000
Professor!

15:49.000 --> 15:50.560
Denver!

15:50.640 --> 15:52.960
Monica, tell my father to hang in there.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.040
We're almost there!

15:54.120 --> 15:55.440
-Denver.
-We're almost done!

15:55.520 --> 15:56.480
-Go back up.
-What?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.480
-Go back up.
-Not now!

15:58.560 --> 15:59.840
-Listen, Denver!
-I'm not...

15:59.920 --> 16:00.840
-Denver!
-What?

16:01.120 --> 16:02.000
Go back up.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.920
You need to go back up, now.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.680
I'm not going back up now.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.480
Denver, stop!

16:18.560 --> 16:20.160
I'm not going back up now!

16:20.520 --> 16:21.560
No!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.240
We're so close, Monica.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.880
I know. Listen.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.880
You have to go back up, now.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.040
Do you understand? Look at me.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.760
If you don't go up now,

16:32.400 --> 16:34.440
you'll regret it for the rest
of your life.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.480
Go up.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.920
Go up.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.080
Hey!

16:42.200 --> 16:43.040
Let's go.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.600
Let's go.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.080
Let's go.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.440
Let's go.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.400
Let's go.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.480
Come on!

17:35.920 --> 17:37.080
I'm here, papa.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.680
Just hold a little longer
because we're going to make it.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.120
Right, Rio? We're digging like crazy.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.560
We already hear
the Serbs on the other side.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.400
Don't worry.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.440
Dad...

17:55.280 --> 17:56.240
-What?
-That...

17:59.000 --> 18:00.360
That thing I said about

18:01.760 --> 18:02.600
hating you...

18:06.400 --> 18:08.400
I could never feel that for you.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.600
I can't hate you, okay?

18:14.480 --> 18:16.120
It's okay. Don't worry.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.960
You did what you had to do with mom.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.160
But I can't hate you.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.520
Monica.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.120
Yes?

18:35.120 --> 18:37.400
I'll give you 300 million if you keep him.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.160
This guy's a headache.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.880
I brought him here,

18:46.600 --> 18:47.440
But...

18:48.000 --> 18:49.640
now I'm going on vacation.

18:50.040 --> 18:50.960
Of course I will.

18:51.800 --> 18:52.720
Take care of him.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.360
Gentlemen.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.400
I haven't introduced myself.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
Agustin Ramos.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.120
And it's been a pleasure.

19:31.000 --> 19:31.960
I love you.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.720
I love you too, papa.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.480
So much.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.200
And I'm not letting you go.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.640
Rio, bring all the explosives
we have left.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.480
I'm blowing up that tunnel.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.400
Donâ€™t.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.960
If you blow the tunnel

19:51.160 --> 19:52.360
you'll bury us all.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.720
But papa...

19:58.320 --> 19:59.720
You have to carry on.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.560
And remember...

20:03.160 --> 20:05.120
-Remember what?
-"No rear-view mirrors".

20:07.480 --> 20:08.400
Alright.

20:10.000 --> 20:10.880
Alright.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.080
But I don't know if I can...

20:14.400 --> 20:15.320
I love you.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.080
I love you too.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.800
I love you too.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.360
It was for the absence of your lips

20:40.520 --> 20:42.560
That I cried for the first time

20:45.280 --> 20:46.840
And I cursed having met you

20:48.560 --> 20:51.600
For not being able to stop loving you

20:54.400 --> 20:56.840
You, my wife I wished to make

20:58.120 --> 20:59.840
And without love, I searched for luck

21:00.640 --> 21:03.200
I pulled out a gun

21:03.520 --> 21:07.080
And fate brought death

21:13.080 --> 21:16.760
Maria, my life, my love

21:17.440 --> 21:18.840
I promised

21:19.400 --> 21:21.320
That I'd return

21:21.760 --> 21:25.560
But I will not return

21:25.800 --> 21:29.760
I was caught by the police

21:30.040 --> 21:33.760
Maria, my life, my love

21:34.240 --> 21:35.680
I will not stop

21:36.040 --> 21:38.240
Loving you

21:38.320 --> 21:41.560
The hugs that I lost

21:42.440 --> 21:47.200
You will not see me again

22:23.800 --> 22:26.080
All the shops in the area
said the same.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.800
Inspector Murillo has seized footage

22:28.880 --> 22:30.760
crucial for the investigation.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.960
Indisputable evidence
that she's collaborating in the heist.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.880
Activate the intervention protocol.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.560
Immediately.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.360
Gather your best men.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.400
What about the hostages?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.800
And Alison Parker,
or the international protocol?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.240
What about public safety?

22:46.600 --> 22:49.040
Colonel, they have large caliber guns,

22:49.120 --> 22:51.040
entrances loaded with explosives.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.960
The hostages wear jumpsuits
and masks, like the thieves.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.600
Impossible to tell them apart.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.800
It will be a bloodbath and you know it.

22:58.800 --> 22:59.960
And what do you suggest?

23:01.120 --> 23:04.240
Let them get away,
holding hands with Inspector Murillo?

23:04.320 --> 23:06.880
Yes. Let them get out
and catch them outside.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.480
Do you know where
public safety has led us?

23:13.800 --> 23:14.960
You want me to tell you?

23:16.120 --> 23:17.760
To us being the laughing stock.

23:18.680 --> 23:21.320
Not only of Spain,
of the whole fucking world.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.640
The world's newscasts follow this story

23:24.720 --> 23:26.120
as if it were the World Cup.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.840
Do you want to be on TV
with the headline:

23:29.000 --> 23:32.520
"The idiots in the police
let an escaped prisoner re-enter

23:32.600 --> 23:35.520
the Royal Mint factory
riding a motorbike".

23:36.360 --> 23:37.920
A motorbike!

23:42.760 --> 23:44.600
Do you like being the goddamn foo?

23:44.760 --> 23:45.600
Excuse me...

23:46.000 --> 23:47.800
I didn't ask for your opinion.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.400
The government has given
the order to intervene.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.400
They have been in there for 125 hours,

23:53.520 --> 23:55.560
and if by chance they were to escape

23:55.640 --> 23:58.040
it would be a disgrace to this country.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.320
-Excuse me...
-What?

23:59.640 --> 24:02.160
The State Prosecutor's Office
issued an arrest warrant

24:02.240 --> 24:03.640
for Inspector Raquel Murillo.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.680
She is under search and arrest.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.320
Shall we close it?

24:21.480 --> 24:22.440
Just like that?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.120
We should...

24:25.320 --> 24:26.960
say a few words or something.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.160
Our Father who art in Heaven,

24:49.080 --> 24:50.880
hallowed be Thy name.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.720
Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in Heaven.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.520
Thy Kingdom come.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.680
What?

24:58.240 --> 24:59.400
You skipped a part.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.400
After "hallowed be Thy name"
comes "Thy Kingdom come."

25:02.480 --> 25:04.160
What the hell does that matter?

25:04.960 --> 25:06.200
If you're going to pray,

25:06.280 --> 25:07.280
do it right.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.800
You think God is checking
if you're saying it right?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.560
Give us this day our daily bread.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.240
And forgive us our debts,

25:25.560 --> 25:28.160
as we also have forgiven our debtors.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.040
And lead us not into temptation,

25:34.040 --> 25:35.320
but deliver us from evil.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.360
Amen.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.840
There are moments in life

25:53.440 --> 25:55.920
where you should be able
to have a remote control

25:56.800 --> 25:57.840
so you could stop it.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.320
Even if just for five minutes.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.000
But some things happen
with irreverent obscenity.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.400
And there's nothing you can do.

26:10.880 --> 26:11.800
On the one hand

26:12.680 --> 26:14.240
we had just buried Moscow.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.040
On the other,

26:17.720 --> 26:20.240
we were opening the path to our freedom.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.920
SHOP AVAILABLE

26:50.000 --> 26:51.920
WEDNESDAY
03:35 PM

26:56.320 --> 26:58.280
HOUR 125 OF THE HEIST

28:18.120 --> 28:19.880
-Where is he?
-In the warehouse.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.400
I'm so sorry.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.040
I'm so sorry.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.200
Come here.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.120
The one with the phone.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.160
Hello.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.400
You can call her Stockholm if you want.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.360
It can't be all tears, can it?

29:38.640 --> 29:39.560
Go on then.

29:40.840 --> 29:41.720
Go.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.720
Nine hundred and eighty four

30:08.720 --> 30:09.720
million euros.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.880
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.800
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.880
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

30:33.960 --> 30:34.800
Yes.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.680
Colonel, we are ready to go in.

31:04.080 --> 31:04.920
Good.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.680
There's news from the tunnel.

31:12.480 --> 31:16.040
The GPR shows that they are
close to the sewer system.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.600
We have a special operations unit
in the sewers.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.680
Entering the main drainage channel.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.960
Target distance 300 meters north.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.840
Copy that. Standing by.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.200
Suarez.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.720
We'll carry out
this operation together.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.880
We'll use an enveloping tactic,
flanking them to force them into the hole.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.600
In other words, a fucking sandwich.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.560
We'll push them from the inside

31:48.640 --> 31:51.240
so that they come out and
catch them at the sewer bend.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.040
They can't go back for cover.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.560
We've got them in a mousetrap.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.000
Now we have to find Inspector Murillo

31:59.600 --> 32:01.320
and her little boyfriend.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.560
Lieutenant.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.240
Come on, go, go!

32:35.520 --> 32:36.640
-Squadron!
-Sir!

32:36.720 --> 32:37.600
Ready?

32:37.680 --> 32:38.560
Yes, sir!

32:38.880 --> 32:40.360
Everyone moving the money.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.400
-We need to get out!
-Very well.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.440
Assault units are
getting ready to come in.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.440
We'll get on it.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.120
We're already in.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.600
Son of a bitch!

33:10.160 --> 33:12.960
Helsinki this won't be the last
you hear from me, I swear!

33:14.400 --> 33:17.080
When I get out
I'll sue the shit out of you,

33:17.360 --> 33:18.760
for cruelty, torture

33:19.080 --> 33:21.320
and crimes against humanity, motherfucker!

33:31.160 --> 33:32.080
Little Arturo,

33:32.800 --> 33:34.120
we're going to the tunnel.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.080
Your very important mission. Yes?

33:39.800 --> 33:40.720
It was fake.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.360
It was fake.

33:48.000 --> 33:48.880
Stand up.

33:50.000 --> 33:50.960
Slowly.

33:55.680 --> 33:56.760
Turn around!

34:02.600 --> 34:04.240
Now you're coming to the station.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.000
And don't fucking move
or this time I will shoot you.

34:08.760 --> 34:09.680
You know why?

34:10.680 --> 34:13.160
Because I've gone for a little walk
in the countryside

34:13.240 --> 34:15.080
and I've had time to think and I regret

34:15.160 --> 34:18.560
not shooting the biggest son of a bitch
that I ever came across in my life.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.520
Raquel, please.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.000
I'm not killing you

34:21.080 --> 34:23.280
because I want you 30 years in prison.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.480
And there,

34:24.840 --> 34:27.880
you get to ask whoever the fuck you want
what he's wearing.

34:40.080 --> 34:40.960
Don't move.

34:41.920 --> 34:42.800
Don't move.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.080
Don't move!

35:00.600 --> 35:01.480
Don't move!

35:02.800 --> 35:03.720
Stay where you are!

35:40.640 --> 35:42.840
MOSCOW. AGUSTIN RAMOS
DOS HERMANAS. MAY 1, 1964

35:42.920 --> 35:44.360
He was born on Labor Day.

35:47.320 --> 35:50.240
On every birthday since he started
working at the mine he said

35:51.240 --> 35:53.400
all the arrangements
were made for his party.

35:53.720 --> 35:54.560
A good picket.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.640
And the rubber bullets were his gifts.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.520
This year it was real bullets.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.760
I guess if you're born on the wrong side,

36:11.040 --> 36:12.320
you die on the wrong side.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.760
What's your name?

36:17.760 --> 36:20.080
-No, Monica.
-I need to know your name.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.760
Because I'm leaving here with you.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.560
Through the back door,
the tunnel, or holding a machine gun.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.800
But I don't want to be away from you.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.680
And if I have to learn to shoot,

36:33.800 --> 36:34.640
I will.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.440
Besides...

36:39.080 --> 36:40.080
this child...

36:41.080 --> 36:42.880
this child is going to need a father.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.360
Come on, tell me your name.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.760
Ricardo.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.600
This is the Underground Unit,
making our way down the sewers.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.760
-What's that noise?
-Stay still.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.080
Itâ€™s the metro. Line 6.
It's right above us.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.520
Proceeding.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.440
Come on, people! Keep it up!

37:34.920 --> 37:38.800
Let's make sure the magic lasts
until the very end!

37:42.480 --> 37:45.880
In there, we'll have satellite
radio and video signal

37:45.960 --> 37:48.160
in order to avoid frequency jammers.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.120
The bomb squad

37:50.640 --> 37:54.720
will open a gap in the cargo door.
300 grams of thermite explosive.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.480
You know what that means.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.120
So Lobo, Ruiz,

37:59.040 --> 38:01.360
you'll provide cover fire, if necessary.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.160
The rest of us will enter in line,
no one stays behind.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.160
Come on, come on, come on!

38:07.400 --> 38:08.240
Gentlemen,

38:08.720 --> 38:10.720
there's going to be a ruckus in there,

38:11.240 --> 38:13.080
so we'll have to be united.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.240
Together!

38:15.280 --> 38:16.120
Understood?

38:16.240 --> 38:17.320
Yes, sir!

38:31.440 --> 38:32.720
The only instructions

38:33.200 --> 38:35.960
are not to open fire if they wear a mask.

38:36.920 --> 38:40.920
Of course, we will open fire
in response to anyone shooting at us.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.600
The only instructions

38:44.120 --> 38:47.400
are that there's no order for any of them
to come out alive.

38:48.000 --> 38:48.880
Is that clear?

38:58.280 --> 38:59.240
Is that clear?

38:59.320 --> 39:00.520
Yes, sir!

39:17.360 --> 39:19.400
We're ready, so let's go get them!

39:19.480 --> 39:20.520
Go, go, go!

39:44.600 --> 39:45.480
Rio,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.720
-Rio, are you there?
-Yes, Professor.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.000
-I encrypted the frequency.
-How long can it take to decode it?

39:51.080 --> 39:51.920
Two hours.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.360
Perfect.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.960
Set the explosive charges.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.520
Pass the intercom to Berlin.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.480
Right away.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.560
Hey.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.080
Come, please.

40:12.000 --> 40:12.920
What's the matter?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.160
I don't feel well.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.400
What's wrong?

40:17.720 --> 40:18.960
I feel pain in my chest.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.640
May be an anxiety attack.
Do you want a tranquilizer?

41:02.040 --> 41:05.040
It would have been easier for me too
if none of this had happened.

41:08.720 --> 41:09.800
It was the only

41:10.880 --> 41:13.160
actual crack
in an otherwise perfect plan.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.720
A plan no longer perfect. You know why?

41:18.120 --> 41:19.960
Because even if this all goes well...

41:22.800 --> 41:24.720
Even if it all goes well, I'll be...

41:25.880 --> 41:27.080
I'll be fucked.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.160
Because I won't ever see you again.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.720
You think it was in my plans
to fall in love

41:36.800 --> 41:38.160
with the inspector?

41:38.240 --> 41:39.480
I don't want to hear more.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.880
You don't want to hear?

41:47.520 --> 41:49.160
Why donâ€™t you want to hear, Raquel?

41:52.600 --> 41:54.000
Because I'm a bad guy?

41:57.400 --> 42:00.080
You've been taught
to see good and bad guys.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.720
But what we're doing
is okay to you when other people do it.

42:05.160 --> 42:09.280
In the year 2011,
the European Central Bank made 171

42:10.880 --> 42:12.480
billion euros out of nowhere.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.160
Just like we're doing.

42:17.600 --> 42:18.880
Only bigger.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.600
185 billion in 2012.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.720
145 billion euros in the 2013.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.960
Do you know where all that money went?

42:31.280 --> 42:32.320
To the banks.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.520
Directly from the factory

42:36.000 --> 42:37.400
to the pockets of the rich.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.360
Did anyone call

42:42.720 --> 42:44.800
the European Central Bank a thief?

42:47.480 --> 42:48.400
No.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.880
"Liquidity injections",

42:50.960 --> 42:52.000
they called it.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.960
And they pulled it out of nowhere, Raquel.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.040
Out of nowhere.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.200
What's this?

43:06.680 --> 43:08.760
This is nothing, Raquel. Paper.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.760
It's paper, you see?

43:13.720 --> 43:14.640
It's paper.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.120
I'm making a liquidity injection,

43:22.000 --> 43:23.160
but not for the banks.

43:23.800 --> 43:24.880
I'm doing it here,

43:25.600 --> 43:26.840
in the real economy.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.440
With this group of...

43:29.000 --> 43:31.160
of losers, which is what we are, Raquel.

43:35.720 --> 43:37.120
To get away from it all.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.480
Don't you want to get away?

43:54.680 --> 43:56.280
Angel is calling you.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.960
Does this mean he woke up?

44:01.120 --> 44:02.800
If he's awake, they're going to...

44:02.880 --> 44:05.240
He'll talk and they will be here
in five minutes.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.400
Okay,

44:07.480 --> 44:08.720
I'm going to answer it.

44:09.160 --> 44:12.160
And you'll speak.
But no nonsense, please.

44:12.240 --> 44:13.120
Please.

44:13.640 --> 44:14.760
You'll answer it

44:15.440 --> 44:16.880
and you're going to verify

44:17.520 --> 44:18.880
if he's awake, okay?

44:20.480 --> 44:21.360
Please.

44:22.600 --> 44:23.480
Please.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.240
No, no! Don't answer it.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.680
Don't answer it.

44:30.720 --> 44:31.920
My phone is tapped.

44:36.400 --> 44:37.880
Do you have another one?

44:51.160 --> 44:52.040
Who is it?

44:52.280 --> 44:53.280
Raquel.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.400
Raquel Murillo.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.040
Angel woke up.

44:57.720 --> 45:00.400
He didn't want us to call anyone
before he talked to you.

45:00.720 --> 45:01.720
I'll put him on.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.240
Raquel,

45:14.120 --> 45:15.000
how are you?

45:21.000 --> 45:21.880
Don't worry,

45:22.240 --> 45:23.280
come on.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.320
Take it easy.

45:27.720 --> 45:28.720
Come on, Raquel.

45:29.880 --> 45:31.520
-How are you?
-Me?

45:32.520 --> 45:34.960
So high I can't even feel my ass.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.440
Listen,

45:43.600 --> 45:45.440
I saw on the TV that you've...

45:46.160 --> 45:48.360
you've been replaced in the investigation.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.360
Yes.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.680
Don't tell anyone I woke up, okay?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.720
I need you to come see me first.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Okay.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.200
Colonel, we've picked up a phone call
to Murillo's number.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.280
But there was no communication.

46:13.360 --> 46:15.360
Locate the call immediately.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.160
Get the owner and the antenna.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.120
Now.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.080
You have to let me go talk to Angel.

46:23.720 --> 46:27.800
If I don't go, in 15 minutes
he'll tell the police where you are.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.720
And I can stop him.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.080
-It's your only chance...
-Please.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.120
It's about your perfect plan
not falling apart.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.720
Please, let me think.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.320
There's nothing to think about.

46:38.560 --> 46:39.440
Sergio.

46:56.800 --> 46:57.720
I'm with you.

46:59.240 --> 47:02.200
A minute ago you were screaming
and biting me like an animal.

47:06.440 --> 47:07.480
Can I trust you?

47:08.200 --> 47:09.040
Come.

47:09.800 --> 47:10.680
Come closer.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.680
