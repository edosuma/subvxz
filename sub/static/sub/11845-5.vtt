00:01.167 --> 00:04.626
- Previously on Roswell.
- Isabel, will you marry me?

00:04.704 --> 00:08.038
- Yes.
- I have to contact my son.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.601
<i>[ Max] There's an underground government
storage facility. Our ship's there.</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:15.308
<i>- [ Isabel] Our spaceship? - [ Max] It's
been reassembled. I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

00:15.382 --> 00:19.785
I got a message for your friend Max:
Stop looking.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.345
<i>[ Loud Whooshing]</i>

00:23.957 --> 00:26.585
There were two shape-shifters
sent down on our ship to protect us.

00:26.659 --> 00:30.596
- <i>And maybe he's still out there.</i>
- <i>So, where</i> do <i>we</i> start.

00:30.663 --> 00:34.099
- <i>[Max] Really?</i>
- <i>That is Ka/ Langley...</i>

00:34.167 --> 00:36.966
the most powerful producer
in this whole town.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.665
<i>Congratulations, Max.
You found me.</i>

00:39.739 --> 00:43.676
- Why'd you kill Ferrini?
- He figured out what I am.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.844
I told you to stop looking for me.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.810
Why are you here?

01:21.881 --> 01:26.182
<i>[ Grunts] I'm looking for our ship
from the '47 crash.</i>

01:26.252 --> 01:30.211
- Who are you working with?
- No one.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.954
Don't lie to me.
I will kill you.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.121
Like you killed Ferrini?

01:36.196 --> 01:38.858
How did you get to Los Angeles?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.697
L-1 O west,
then straight north.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.897
Don't get cute with me, you prick.

01:44.971 --> 01:49.499
Do you murder everyone who discovers
you're an alien, or do they get a warning first?

01:49.576 --> 01:52.375
Why do you think
I know where this ship is?

01:54.314 --> 01:56.476
You knew it was in Utah.

02:01.287 --> 02:05.485
- Who else knows?
- [Coughs] Please, the-the smoke.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.890
Answer me!

02:07.961 --> 02:10.362
[Coughing]

02:11.898 --> 02:14.959
So this is the mighty
king ofAntar?

02:15.034 --> 02:18.231
A low-rent Tom Cruise
with a $10 haircut?

02:18.304 --> 02:23.037
Buddy boy, you have no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

02:23.109 --> 02:26.875
I came all this way to find you.
I need your help.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.182
You're our protector.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.015
Don't call me that.

02:33.086 --> 02:37.023
Yeah, I was put on that ship
to protect you...

02:37.090 --> 02:39.081
but that was 5O years ago.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.593
- [Coughing]
- Boys!

02:48.668 --> 02:52.366
You're leaving or you're dead.

02:55.141 --> 02:58.771
- Take Mr. Evans to my airplane.
- <i>[Man]</i> Yes, sir.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.280

03:56.369 --> 03:58.895
[Sighs]

03:58.972 --> 04:03.432
I want a country wedding.
Something simple but elegant.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.604
Sounds like you and Mom
have been brainstorming.

04:06.679 --> 04:11.947
Oh, not me. I, uh, I can hardly get
used to the fact that I'm here.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.147
- Mom, you said you'd be supportive.
- I didn't exactly have a choice.

04:15.221 --> 04:18.281
It's always a surprise
when your little girl takes this step.

04:18.358 --> 04:23.558
Patrick, I need mist over here.
These lilies are languishing before my eyes.

04:23.630 --> 04:27.225
- [ Sighs]
- Why are you being so negative?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.667
Isabel, I am in shock.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.706
I mean, I've barely gotten used to
the idea of you graduating high school.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.366
Mom, we have been discussing
this for 48 hours straight.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.103
<i>I mean, you are the one who hired
the annoying wedding planner.</i>

04:38.177 --> 04:40.544
Well, I mean, if you're actually
going to go through with this...

04:40.613 --> 04:43.139
<i>- you need to have a realistic plan.
- W?</i>

04:43.216 --> 04:46.584
Sorry. So, where were we?

04:46.653 --> 04:50.487
Well, I was thinking that I'd like to have
the wedding in a freshly mown field...

04:50.556 --> 04:53.526
maybe next to a pond and then have
the reception in an old barn.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.392
Oh, that's a lovely notion.
Really, it is, Isabel.

04:56.462 --> 05:01.798
But when you go country, you open the door
to a host of logistical nightmares.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.860
<i>Plus, the insect population,
very hard to control.</i>

05:04.937 --> 05:06.871
You want to know
a wonderful venue?

05:06.939 --> 05:10.034
The lobby of the Springfield Inn.
I have done so many weddings there.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.407
Yes, but I don't want
someone else's wedding.

05:12.478 --> 05:18.383
<i>Maybe we could light the barn with
torches. Not- Not like tiki torches.</i>

05:18.451 --> 05:21.910
Maybe torches is the wrong word.
More like candles.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.219
Oh, there's nothing more
flammable than an old barn.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.259
Yes, why that's why we need the pond.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.695
Windy, this is my fiancéJesse.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.731
So, when do we want to have the big day?

05:32.799 --> 05:35.700
- <i>[Isabel] This spring.</i>
- What?

05:35.768 --> 05:37.600
We figured why wait?

05:37.670 --> 05:41.402
This is not a race. I mean,
the two of you just got engaged.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.602
Mom, it's what we want.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.441
Can't you just be happy?
We're planning my wedding.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.607
I mean, it's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be great.

05:49.682 --> 05:53.778
Oh. So cute, so in love.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.220
<i>[ Chattering]</i>

05:59.292 --> 06:01.818
<i>So, uh, what happened with Tiffany?
Did she walk?</i>

06:01.894 --> 06:04.329
What, are you kidding?
She's an actress.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.627
I bumped up her per diem.
I put her in a bigger trailer.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.827
I got Brian to rewrite the part.

06:08.901 --> 06:13.304
My finest hour. Now the hooker's
a part-time yoga instructor.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.467
<i>[ Max ]
You?! open 3D million, easy.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:20.775
Sorry I'm late.
I was on the phone with <i>Vaflezy.</i>

06:20.847 --> 06:23.509
I thought you were on an airplane.

06:23.583 --> 06:27.019
Nah. I wanted to keep
talking about our project.

06:27.086 --> 06:29.680
Project?

06:29.756 --> 06:32.453
You're killing me, Kal.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.653
Max Evans,
Antar Films.

06:36.929 --> 06:41.457
Voiié. M8<M Tabasco
swirl cookies.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.832
I came up with the recipe
all by myself.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.305
A care package.
Max is so spoiled.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.364
No, he is not.

06:49.442 --> 06:52.139
- Liz, he hasn't been gone more than a week.
- Could you just let me finish?

06:52.211 --> 06:55.476
- Because he's calling in less than an hour.
- Really?

06:55.548 --> 06:58.848
Are you guys gonna talk, or are you just
gonna breathe heavy into the phone?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.046
Are you gonna repeat each other's
name back and forth and back and forth?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.350
- Stop it.
- [Giggles]

07:03.423 --> 07:06.154
Oh, uh, hey, hi.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.024
Um, I'm getting married
tojesse Ramirez.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.654
- What?
- What?

07:10.730 --> 07:13.495
Yeah. And, you know, weddings are
full of all kinds of stupid traditions...

07:13.566 --> 07:17.366
like the garter toss and that chicken dance
and, well, bridesmaids.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.667
And since you guys are
the closest thing I have to girlfriends...

07:19.739 --> 07:22.674
I was wondering
if you would be mine.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.910
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure.

07:25.978 --> 07:30.074
Great. Good. Okay, that's done.
Okay. Is that for Max?

07:30.149 --> 07:32.345
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, sure is.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.546
- God, he's so spoiled.
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.714
You know what- he doesn't
know about the engagement yet...

07:36.789 --> 07:40.089
so let’s just keep it that way, and, Maria,
I'm gonna need you to tell Michael for me.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.184
Okay, see ya.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.362
Did that just happen?

07:47.433 --> 07:53.372
<i>An alien, stranded on Earth,
tries to find his way back home.</i>

07:53.439 --> 07:57.239
- Like E. 7'.
- Yes, but think Tom Cruise.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.871
- So, more like Starman.
- Exactly.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.938
That picture didn't open.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.846
Oh, it gets better, Kal.

08:08.921 --> 08:12.448
See, our guy hunts down another alien,
also stranded on Earth.

08:14.293 --> 08:17.729
- He's the only person who can
help him on his quest. - [Man/How?

08:17.797 --> 08:20.562
I'm glad you asked, Scott.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.728
- <i>There's</i> a ship.
- <i>[Ka/ Laughing]</i>

08:23.803 --> 08:27.535
And this other alien might know where it is
or at least have the resources to find it.

08:27.607 --> 08:32.977
<i>You see, this other alien
is a big Hollywood producer.</i>

08:33.044 --> 08:36.140
[All Laughing]

08:38.484 --> 08:44.389
That I like. Except I-l don't like
these feel-good science fiction flicks.

08:44.457 --> 08:48.894
I don't think they're interesting
unless somebody dies.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.564
<i>Why is it you feel
you are above doorbells?</i>

08:59.639 --> 09:02.904
Got your message.
Is it a joke?

09:02.975 --> 09:04.909
No. I'm getting married.

09:06.779 --> 09:10.010
- We agreed not to bring anyone else into this.
- Michael...

09:12.485 --> 09:15.284
I don't want to put my life on hold.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.846
This is my one chance to be happy.

09:17.924 --> 09:21.861
To love someone and have him love
me back without all of this garbage...

09:21.928 --> 09:26.456
that has made us miserable
our whole lives getting in the way.

09:26.532 --> 09:31.698
I've put a lot of thought into it, and I don't see
any reason whyjesse has to know the truth.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.705
Well, knowing what I know
about alien sex...

09:33.773 --> 09:35.935
he's going to have major questions
after the honeymoon.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.999
Okay, Michael, get out of my room.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.347
What did Max say?

09:42.415 --> 09:46.181
[Sighs] I'm gonna tell him
when he gets back.

09:48.821 --> 09:52.280
- Come on, Michael, just congratulate me.
- On what?

10:06.906 --> 10:10.001
Call me tomorrow?
Do lunch?

10:10.076 --> 10:14.377
<i>Max, that pitch of yours-</i>

10:14.447 --> 10:16.677
Stick around, I got something
I'd like to throw at you.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.740
- Sure you don't want me to stick around too-
- Good night, Brian.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.809
Okay.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.551
<i>- [Horn Hanks]
- [Bran ] Goodnight, Kai.</i>

10:40.439 --> 10:44.706
You come to my home.
You taunt me in front of my friends.

10:44.777 --> 10:49.613
- You threatened to expose me!
- I have a son.

10:53.285 --> 10:56.346
You mated with another alien hybrid.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.356
My child is back on Antar.
He's in trouble.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.724
That's why I need the ship
and one of its pilots.

11:01.794 --> 11:04.695
The air force reassembled that ship...

11:05.765 --> 11:07.699
but it will never fly.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.737
If anyone can get it up and running,
it would be you.

11:12.638 --> 11:16.597
I told you.
I told you I would kill you.

11:19.211 --> 11:21.305
You're gonna have to.

11:39.765 --> 11:42.325
You can't kill me, can you?

11:42.401 --> 11:44.733
<i>You've had so many chances.</i>

11:44.804 --> 11:48.104
Utah. Yesterday in the film vault.

11:48.174 --> 11:52.873
[Chuckles] But you can't
because you're my protector.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.205
Get as mad as you want,
but get one thing straight.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.377
I am not going anywhere
until you help me.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.425
I still can't believe
Isabel's getting married.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.630
This is, like, a disaster
of epic proportions.

12:18.704 --> 12:22.436
If you think Michael freaked when
he found out, Max is gonna go ballistic.

12:22.508 --> 12:26.069
- And whdsjesse Ramirez?
- I don't know.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.978
- H1; girls.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Evans. You're here.

12:29.048 --> 12:32.040
- I mean, how are- how are you?
- Good

12:32.118 --> 12:36.021
- <i>So,</i> what's <i>new?</i>
- <i>Uh, nothing You know...</i>

12:37.757 --> 12:39.885
- Roswell.
- Mm.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.519
Well, actually, I, uh,
I was looking for Michael.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.064
Um, sorry, but he's not working today.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.157
Mm.Well, Maria,
would you kindly remind him...

12:48.234 --> 12:51.431
that he still has
my 9-by-l 3 casserole dish?

12:51.504 --> 12:55.463
Isabel took something over weeks ago
for Max, and I'd like it back.

12:55.541 --> 12:59.102
I'll- Well, I'll
remind him, definitely.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.950
So, Liz, how is Max?

13:05.017 --> 13:09.147
Um, he's fine.

13:09.221 --> 13:12.191
I was wondering if you happen to
have his new cell phone number.

13:12.258 --> 13:15.751
Apparently, he, uh, he changed
it when he moved out.

13:15.828 --> 13:21.358
<i>I've left a couple messages at Michael's, but
I'm not even sure he's living there anymore.</i>

13:22.835 --> 13:27.932
I just want to talk to my son.
I want to know that he's safe.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.635
I'm sure you can understand that,
can't you?

13:33.312 --> 13:35.474
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

13:40.186 --> 13:44.680
Well, <i>I'll</i> let you girls get back to work.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.816
Okay, bye.

13:48.994 --> 13:53.363
Open defiance of a parental unit. Whoo!

13:53.432 --> 13:57.699
This is just so twisted
and... romantic.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.933
You and Max are totally Romeo
andjuliet against the world.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.632
Actually, Romeo never called last night.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.145
- What?
- Yeah.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.412
Hey! I'm not done!

14:08.413 --> 14:09.574
Hey! I'm not done!

14:17.121 --> 14:20.386
- He'd better be in a ditch somewhere.
- Maria, do not say that.

14:20.458 --> 14:23.826
I'm just saying, blowing offa phone date
is unacceptable, that's all.

14:23.895 --> 14:26.830
Look, I am just trying to convince myself
that he's not hurt or worse.

14:26.898 --> 14:28.832
That he is just busy.

14:28.900 --> 14:32.234
- Call his alien butt.
- No.

14:32.303 --> 14:35.830
No, I am not gonna become the codependent
girlfriend, not when he's on this whole quest.

14:35.907 --> 14:40.902
Okay, I respect that. But, I mean,
how long is this thing gonna take?

14:40.978 --> 14:43.413
He may never find his son.

14:43.481 --> 14:45.449
- Thanks for that pep talk, Maria.
- No.

14:45.516 --> 14:49.043
Okay, there's no doubt in my mind
that he is madly in love with you...

14:49.120 --> 14:51.919
but, I mean,
you're half of this couple.

14:51.989 --> 14:54.549
You know, you can't forget that.

15:01.032 --> 15:04.058
Good morning.

- I like tea.

I first came out of the pods...

15:27.024 --> 15:29.186

For the first few months, I couldn't smell
or taste anything except for strong flavors.

15:34.031 --> 15:36.659
Sugar, lemon, Tabasco.

- I don't shape-shift. I haven't done it in years.

Well, the first 3O years it was.

Soon after that, lemons.
