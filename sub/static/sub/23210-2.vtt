WEBVTT

00:01.211 --> 00:04.576
You kill people, don't you?

00:04.601 --> 00:06.890
<i>I go to this border town
for a little R&R.</i>

00:06.953 --> 00:08.061
Kill or be killed.

00:08.117 --> 00:09.427
And I've been using
your place as a safe house.

00:09.451 --> 00:11.218
I hope that's okay.

00:11.253 --> 00:12.463
I thought perhaps
your partner going to prison

00:12.487 --> 00:13.553
<i>may have given you pause.</i>

00:13.588 --> 00:15.488
People kept needing me.

00:15.524 --> 00:16.801
<i>We don't murder perfectly
healthy individuals</i>

00:16.825 --> 00:18.257
<i>who happen to be a bit sad.</i>

00:18.293 --> 00:20.293
Buddy, no!

00:20.328 --> 00:22.829
<i>Well, in Switzerland,
a doctor would give a patient</i>

00:22.864 --> 00:27.500
<i>such as yourself a lethal dose
of sodium pentobarbital,</i>

00:27.536 --> 00:29.435
<i>to drink.</i>

00:29.470 --> 00:31.081
Jess, I have some of your dad's
things that he left here.

00:31.105 --> 00:32.283
Would you see that
he gets them, please?

00:32.307 --> 00:33.839
Sure.

00:33.874 --> 00:34.840
And I don't think we should
only help people

00:34.875 --> 00:36.575
when it's easy for us.

00:36.610 --> 00:38.277
We also have to be able
to sleep at night.

00:38.313 --> 00:40.146
<i>The first death
I do with you ends</i>

00:40.181 --> 00:42.781
<i>with a woman flinging
herself off a balcony,</i>

00:42.817 --> 00:45.016
<i>and then you welcome
Grady's sister into our lives.</i>

00:45.052 --> 00:46.585
<i>I didn't.
She took advantage of me.</i>

00:46.620 --> 00:48.286
I'm gonna need you
to kill my husband.

00:48.322 --> 00:50.355
Mary she said it was... it was
either him or me.

00:50.390 --> 00:52.023
I'm the woman who
killed your brother.

00:52.059 --> 00:53.492
A cop killed my brother.

00:53.527 --> 00:54.993
A cop may have pulled
the trigger,

00:55.028 --> 00:57.663
but I let Grady
bleed out and die.

00:57.698 --> 01:02.000
If you ever mess with me or Des
again, I will kill you too.

01:02.035 --> 01:03.468
Just a bad couple of days.

01:03.503 --> 01:04.780
It's growing pains or something.

01:04.804 --> 01:06.304
I just want to help people,

01:06.340 --> 01:10.108
Des, and when
I do it alone, I can.

01:10.143 --> 01:12.543
You'll feel a rush
through your body,

01:12.579 --> 01:14.812
and then a warm feeling
of peacefulness

01:14.848 --> 01:17.349
will take you slowly into sleep.

01:17.384 --> 01:20.217
You can press it again and
again.

02:55.079 --> 02:57.244
What does it mean?

02:57.280 --> 03:02.450
Don't be afraid.
Love does not kill.

03:02.485 --> 03:07.789
It's life itself, and it shines
with heavenly joys.

03:07.824 --> 03:08.957
That's beautiful.

03:11.127 --> 03:12.594
It's my first time.

03:12.629 --> 03:15.096
I had no idea
it was so powerful.

03:15.131 --> 03:17.465
We haven't even gotten
to the good stuff.

03:27.443 --> 03:29.943
To the finale.

05:41.940 --> 05:44.073
Sorry I'm late.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.747
Has she contacted you?

05:50.782 --> 05:53.249
Who?

05:53.284 --> 05:55.284
Grady's sister, Olivia.

05:55.319 --> 05:57.553
- No.
- Good.

05:57.588 --> 06:00.122
You can't see her again.
If she tries, ignore her.

06:00.157 --> 06:02.725
Is that what I should do,
mumsy? I'll do my very best.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.594
Can we be civil?

06:05.630 --> 06:08.897
Everything your cold, dead
heart desires is right there.

06:08.932 --> 06:10.566
Civil enough for you?

06:10.601 --> 06:13.001
- What's this?
- It's called pentobarbital.

06:13.036 --> 06:15.003
It's a barbiturate.

06:15.038 --> 06:16.282
In smaller doses it slows down
brain activity. In larger...

06:16.306 --> 06:18.339
- Des.
- Yes, Mary?

06:18.375 --> 06:21.542
- I meant where's the rest?
- I've decided to keep half.

06:22.813 --> 06:24.612
For what?

06:24.648 --> 06:26.648
I'm opening up a pharmacy
called "Desmond's Drugs."

06:26.683 --> 06:28.516
What do you think?
And I'm keeping all the.

06:28.551 --> 06:30.351
Champers,
'cause you can buy more

06:30.387 --> 06:31.864
with all the money you made
while I was, you know,

06:31.888 --> 06:33.254
rotting away in prison for you.

06:33.290 --> 06:34.490
- Des.
- Why do you keep saying

06:34.524 --> 06:36.324
my bloody name?

06:36.359 --> 06:38.760
If you have something to say,
then please just say it.

06:38.795 --> 06:41.462
Did you ever think maybe
I was doing this for you,

06:41.498 --> 06:43.431
to protect you?

06:43.466 --> 06:45.433
Is that it? Is it?

06:45.468 --> 06:47.802
Because I thought this was all
about you not having anyone

06:47.837 --> 06:50.037
to answer to, but my mistake.

06:50.072 --> 06:52.673
No, if this is about
your sacrificing

06:52.708 --> 06:54.775
everything
for the greater good, for me,

06:54.811 --> 06:58.045
well, then thank you.
Thank you for protecting me.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.916
In the immaculate heart
of Mary I trust.

07:05.487 --> 07:09.989
You know, I had this dream
the other night,

07:11.993 --> 07:16.563
It was just you, me,
the death retreat.

07:16.598 --> 07:20.500
It could have been stunning.

07:20.536 --> 07:24.938
That was always your dream,
not mine.

07:29.211 --> 07:31.044
Good luck, Des.

07:31.079 --> 07:35.114
No, Dr. Harris,
good luck to you.

07:41.756 --> 07:46.359
"Before you came along,
I thought I'd be alone forever,

07:46.394 --> 07:51.530
but then you unleashed in me
a love that could not sever."

07:51.566 --> 07:54.333
That's beyond tragic.

07:54.368 --> 07:58.003
Yeah, who knew your dad
was such a romantic?

07:58.038 --> 07:59.878
- What else is in here?
- I don't want to know.

08:01.441 --> 08:03.275
Now, why would she give
these back?

08:03.310 --> 08:07.545
My God, no, no.
I might not recover from this.

08:07.581 --> 08:08.947
Extra large.

08:08.983 --> 08:10.263
No, that's too much information.

08:12.452 --> 08:14.352
, my mom's home.

08:14.388 --> 08:17.455
I promised her I'd make a salad
before she got here.

08:17.491 --> 08:19.891
You do that.

08:19.926 --> 08:21.393
How's that salad coming along?

08:21.428 --> 08:24.128
- I'm on it.
- I'm just asking.

08:24.163 --> 08:26.765
I'm just answering.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.732
Perfect timing,

08:28.768 --> 08:30.301
Dinner's almost ready.

08:30.336 --> 08:32.270
Kevin, Jess was supposed
to do that.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.383
- Well, what are fathers for?
- Nobody seems to know.

08:34.407 --> 08:36.407
Don't condone her behavior.
Let her make the salad.

08:36.442 --> 08:38.409
- It's okay. I'm happy to help.
- Are you sure?

08:38.443 --> 08:40.443
- Yes.
- What is this?

08:40.479 --> 08:42.491
Yeah, some guys came bay
and delivered it this morning.

08:42.515 --> 08:43.924
I wasn't sure where
you wanted it, so...

08:43.948 --> 08:45.716
Why do we need a fridge
with an app?

08:45.751 --> 08:47.228
Well, because we're living
in the future, kid.

08:47.252 --> 08:48.263
Well, they must have
delivered it

08:48.287 --> 08:49.720
to the wrong house.

08:49.755 --> 08:51.422
Is there a receipt or something?

08:51.457 --> 08:53.524
Yeah, it's right there
on the counter.

08:56.995 --> 09:00.230
No, no too much.
Not too much lemon.

09:00.265 --> 09:02.598
All right. Put this in.

09:02.634 --> 09:05.902
It's just a mistake, that's all.

09:05.938 --> 09:08.939
I'll call them tomorrow.

09:08.974 --> 09:11.474
Perfect, perfect.

09:17.281 --> 09:20.650
Sex tape?

09:32.664 --> 09:33.862
Threesome?

09:36.133 --> 09:38.000
<i>Do you have any questions?</i>

09:38.035 --> 09:41.036
<i>Yeah, yeah, why a drink
and not injections?</i>

09:41.072 --> 09:43.339
<i>'Cause I researched it, right,
and it's... it's better.</i>

09:43.374 --> 09:45.207
<i>It's a smoother exit.</i>

09:45.242 --> 09:48.310
<i>Young Joel
brings up a valid point.</i>

09:48.346 --> 09:50.779
<i>Well, I think doctors feel
it's important for patients</i>

09:50.814 --> 09:52.443
<i>to choose their death.</i>

09:54.351 --> 09:57.385
<i>Okay, I get it.</i>

09:57.420 --> 09:59.354
<i>I got to pull the trigger.</i>

09:59.389 --> 10:01.723
<i>This is obviously
a very serious decision.</i>

10:01.758 --> 10:04.258
<i>Yeah, I know that.</i>

10:21.696 --> 10:27.233
Okay, picture this: Cabins
right here with that view.

10:27.269 --> 10:29.335
There's one for each patient
but with enough room

10:29.371 --> 10:31.704
for loved ones
who want to stay as well.

10:31.739 --> 10:33.573
Up here there's an old
fishing lodge.

10:33.608 --> 10:37.576
We can use it as a communal
kitchen with an onsite chef.

10:37.611 --> 10:40.880
We'll put picnic tables
all along the water.

10:40.915 --> 10:45.284
So how do you expect
to get away with all of this?

10:45.319 --> 10:46.752
We register as a hospice.

10:46.788 --> 10:48.120
That way when there's
a dead body,

10:48.156 --> 10:49.421
no one will ask any questions.

10:49.456 --> 10:51.456
It will all seem legit.

10:51.492 --> 10:55.760
Excon running a hospice,
sounds legit to me.

10:55.796 --> 10:57.707
It'll be a little piece
of heaven to transition you

10:57.731 --> 10:59.298
to the real thing,

10:59.333 --> 11:01.433
you know, if that's what
you believe awaits you.

11:01.468 --> 11:03.368
We'll encourage a culture
where death

11:03.404 --> 11:06.037
doesn't have to be so scary,

11:06.073 --> 11:07.806
that we're all in this together.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.241
Okay, I get it.
How much do you want from me?

11:10.276 --> 11:12.110
I need 50K for a deposit.

11:12.145 --> 11:14.045
I know, I know,
it seems like a lot of money,

11:14.081 --> 11:15.424
but not really
when you think about

11:15.448 --> 11:16.981
what you'll be making in return.

11:17.017 --> 11:19.283
I should be able to pay you
back plus interest

11:19.319 --> 11:22.787
within a month
of being up and running.

11:22.823 --> 11:26.957
- What about Mary?
- Mary who?

11:26.992 --> 11:28.437
You guys are serious
about this breakup?

11:28.461 --> 11:29.760
Dead serious.

11:29.795 --> 11:31.495
Well, without her,

11:31.531 --> 11:32.974
where are you gonna get
the rest of the money?

11:32.998 --> 11:35.433
You're gonna start
feeding me patients.

11:35.468 --> 11:36.360
Am I?

11:36.385 --> 11:39.637
What's Mary paying you,
2 grand a pop?

11:39.672 --> 11:42.706
I'll give you three.
More money, more money.

11:45.677 --> 11:48.112
Mary didn't say I have to be
exclusive with her.

11:48.147 --> 11:50.313
'Tis called the free market.

11:52.317 --> 11:54.317
Okay.

11:54.353 --> 11:57.420
Joshua Yang, nice kid, he was
in the ICU a little while ago,

11:57.456 --> 11:58.855
stage four bowel cancer.

11:58.890 --> 12:00.156
He's only 21.

12:00.191 --> 12:04.827
A shame. I'll take him.

12:04.863 --> 12:09.999
I think this could be the start
of something beautiful.

12:10.034 --> 12:13.436
- Shall we christen the land?
- Really?

12:13.472 --> 12:14.472
No.

12:18.509 --> 12:21.443
The way I see it,
you have a choice.

12:21.479 --> 12:24.046
You can believe in nothing, or
you can believe in something,

12:24.082 --> 12:26.983
and I choose something.
What about you?

12:27.018 --> 12:31.453
I was raised by atheists.
I'm a godless child.

12:31.489 --> 12:34.856
You know, you don't have to
believe what they believe.

12:34.892 --> 12:36.792
What are you guys talking about?

12:36.827 --> 12:39.395
- God.
- Seriously?

12:39.430 --> 12:42.564
What, you're just walking
around talking about God?

12:42.600 --> 12:43.965
It's thrilling, really.

12:44.001 --> 12:45.734
Do you believe
in anything, Naomi?

12:45.770 --> 12:47.869
Well, I believe in Prada,

12:47.905 --> 12:52.174
marrying rich, diamond
divorcee, but who cares?

12:52.209 --> 12:54.542
We all end up
as dust anyway, so...

12:54.577 --> 12:57.578
- That's bleak.
- I'm a realist.

12:57.614 --> 12:59.247
Can you not make
any plans tonight?

12:59.283 --> 13:00.882
I have to tell you something.

13:00.918 --> 13:04.185
Um, Heather and I
already made plans.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.120
Well, cancel them.

13:07.590 --> 13:09.223
This isn't a joke, Jess.

13:09.258 --> 13:10.703
There's something that
I really need to show you,

13:10.727 --> 13:14.061
and it's kind of
confidential, so...

13:14.096 --> 13:15.596
- I...
- What?

13:15.632 --> 13:17.097
Naomi, me and Jess,

13:17.133 --> 13:20.100
we're hanging out
tonight without you.

13:20.136 --> 13:22.069
We'll hang out later, 'Kay?

13:22.104 --> 13:24.205
Sure, whatever.

13:33.415 --> 13:35.115
- Curls suit you.
- When I was five.

13:35.151 --> 13:37.016
Keep it straight. You know,

13:37.052 --> 13:38.697
you'd think since you were
the one asking for my help

13:38.721 --> 13:40.298
that you would be
extra nice to me right now.

13:40.322 --> 13:42.789
Nicole, seriously, no curls.

13:46.428 --> 13:49.262
Okay, so it's simple.
You're a cash business.

13:49.297 --> 13:51.931
All you have to do
is add in a few clients

13:51.967 --> 13:53.699
here and there,
and no one will question it.

13:53.735 --> 13:55.301
And what is a few to you?

13:59.341 --> 14:02.708
My God.

14:02.744 --> 14:06.145
Have you lost your mind?
How much is in here?

14:06.181 --> 14:09.648
200 grand, give or take.

14:09.684 --> 14:11.950
I've never made
this kind of money.

14:11.986 --> 14:14.286
You're expanding your business.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.121
You can offer more services.

14:16.156 --> 14:19.425
Yeah? Like what, legal advice?

14:19.460 --> 14:22.461
I'm not talking literally,
just on paper,

14:22.497 --> 14:24.430
and you don't have
to do it all at once.

14:24.465 --> 14:27.933
- Baby steps.
- Baby steps?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.302
What's in it for me?

14:30.337 --> 14:34.439
- I'll give you a cut.
- Obviously. What else?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.908
What else, what else?

14:35.943 --> 14:39.544
I want to come
with you on a death.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.481
I just told you
I broke up with Des,

14:43.517 --> 14:45.349
that I'm better off
doing this on my own.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.485
I know, I know,
you're a lone wolf.

14:47.521 --> 14:52.457
I heard you.
I just... I'm just curious.

14:52.492 --> 14:56.628
You know what curiosity
did to the cat.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.496
That cat was so stupid.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.969
I'm being serious.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.837
I think it would be
too much for you.

15:06.872 --> 15:10.308
I can handle it, Mary.
I've seen a dead person before.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.076
Do you remember?

15:25.257 --> 15:27.190
Hi, Mary Harris?

15:27.225 --> 15:29.059
No, I don't want it.
I don't want it.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.372
You take it back, and you take
the fridge while you're at it.

15:31.396 --> 15:33.896
I was told not to leave
unless delivery was accepted.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.065
I'm not accepting.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.007
Is everything all right?

15:44.042 --> 15:46.576
Yeah, everything's great.

15:46.611 --> 15:50.212
Okay, what's the verdict?
Am I coming or not?

15:50.247 --> 15:51.614
Not.

15:53.017 --> 15:56.051
- What's that?
- Nothing.

15:57.188 --> 16:00.556
Come on, Mary.
It's a simple quid pro quo.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.559
I do something for you,
you do something for me.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.462
I don't think
that's too much to ask.

16:15.215 --> 16:17.449
Which one of us
do you think is older?

16:25.725 --> 16:28.293
You're not only beautiful,
but you're smart too.

16:28.328 --> 16:30.128
I'm not so sure about
the beautiful part,

16:30.163 --> 16:31.662
but I'll take the smart.

16:31.698 --> 16:33.331
You're stunning, Estelle,
and she knew

16:33.366 --> 16:35.666
because I introduced you
as my younger sister.

16:35.702 --> 16:38.936
You two remind me of me
and my sister.

16:38.971 --> 16:40.538
She died a few years ago,

16:40.573 --> 16:45.142
but back in the day
we were inseparable.

16:45.177 --> 16:47.712
I'm sorry.

16:47.747 --> 16:49.112
Are you okay?
Do you want to sit?

16:49.148 --> 16:51.549
Yeah.

16:51.584 --> 16:54.218
- Is this where you want to be?
- Yeah, it's perfect.

16:54.253 --> 16:57.354
It's perfect.

16:57.389 --> 17:01.624
Ready to sing my swan song?

17:01.660 --> 17:03.994
We played in a band together,
my sister and I.

17:04.029 --> 17:08.042
- Do you still sing?
- It's not so much fun

17:08.068 --> 17:08.965
without an audience.

17:09.001 --> 17:12.669
We loved it, different city
every night.

17:13.512 --> 17:14.878
Same man though.

17:14.914 --> 17:18.015
That sounds like a story.

17:18.050 --> 17:21.352
I don't kiss and tell.

17:21.387 --> 17:22.590
Hell, yeah, I do.

17:24.201 --> 17:29.271
I was a cliché, falling in love
with the guy who plays guitar.

17:30.140 --> 17:35.077
He wanted to settle down, but I
kept going.

17:35.112 --> 17:37.245
He didn't follow.

17:37.281 --> 17:40.456
- Well, he was nuts.
- Yeah, he was.

17:40.511 --> 17:41.450
I was cute.

17:41.485 --> 17:43.812
You should have seen me
before I let myself go.

17:43.882 --> 17:44.786
Are you kidding me?

17:44.821 --> 17:47.088
I would kill to have
your bone structure.

17:47.123 --> 17:48.623
Cancer gave me the cheekbones

17:48.658 --> 17:51.025
I always wanted.

17:53.062 --> 17:55.597
You know, Nicole
does hair and makeup.

17:55.632 --> 17:58.500
She's really an artist
in her own right.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.202
- Is that so?
- Yeah, come on.

18:01.237 --> 18:03.506
Let me do you up.
I would be honored.

18:05.803 --> 18:07.671
Guess a little blush
wouldn't hurt.

18:14.850 --> 18:16.650
Shit.

18:16.685 --> 18:18.018
What?

18:18.053 --> 18:19.786
I hate to do this
to you, Joshua,

18:19.822 --> 18:23.891
but do you happen by chance
to have a drinking glass?

18:23.926 --> 18:27.260
How about this one?

18:31.266 --> 18:33.133
This?

18:33.168 --> 18:34.645
Yeah, my parents never really
throw anything out.

18:34.669 --> 18:36.802
Well, I'm okay
with it if you are.

18:36.838 --> 18:38.704
What do I care?

18:40.842 --> 18:42.627
When did you move back in?

18:42.706 --> 18:45.173
I was diagnosed
about a week ago.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.476
I moved back home the same day.

18:47.512 --> 18:49.345
You were only
diagnosed a week ago?

18:49.381 --> 18:53.382
That's rather fast to
have arrived at this decision.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.229
Yeah, well, when you're given
three weeks to live,

18:55.253 --> 18:57.786
things kind of speed up.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.396
Your records say bowel cancer.

19:07.431 --> 19:10.565
Yeah, Joshua Yang, 21,

19:10.601 --> 19:14.903
died from bowel cancer;
That's pretty pathetic.

19:14.938 --> 19:17.105
Well, technically
you're gonna be dying

19:17.140 --> 19:20.074
from a lethal drug overdose.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.611
I guess so.

19:32.488 --> 19:34.989
Josh, come on.

19:40.563 --> 19:44.064
You know, a lot of people
choose to do this outside,

19:44.099 --> 19:49.036
fresh air, nature, the whole
returning to the earth.

19:49.071 --> 19:51.305
What do you say
we change locales?

20:12.260 --> 20:13.860
Boop.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.764
You want to take a look?

20:21.635 --> 20:25.737
You are an artist.

20:25.773 --> 20:27.506
You look beautiful.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.309
I do, don't I?

20:30.345 --> 20:32.644
Well, is that time already?

20:32.680 --> 20:34.079
Only if you want it to be.

20:34.114 --> 20:35.213
We're on your schedule.

20:37.785 --> 20:39.050
I'm ready.

20:43.123 --> 20:46.324
- You ladies join me for a drink?
- Of course.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.660
I can't drink on the job.

21:10.717 --> 21:13.217
Cheers, honey.

21:29.701 --> 21:34.405
Here I go.

21:37.176 --> 21:40.010
You two are so lucky
to have one another.

21:40.045 --> 21:41.745
We're here with you.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.147
Is she?

22:53.182 --> 22:54.281
Yeah.

23:07.096 --> 23:09.163
Okay, we have to go now.

23:09.198 --> 23:11.599
What? We're just gonna
leave her here?

23:11.634 --> 23:13.400
Yes.

23:13.436 --> 23:15.302
We can't just leave her.

23:15.338 --> 23:19.006
Nicole, we have to go. Now.

23:29.184 --> 23:32.119
So you're sure you don't want
your parents here with you?

23:32.154 --> 23:34.187
They're with
their therapist right now.

23:34.222 --> 23:37.023
Apparently this whole thing's
been very hard on them.

23:37.058 --> 23:39.359
So they don't know
that you're doing this?

23:39.394 --> 23:42.262
They know.
They just don't agree.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.142
It could be good for you
to have people you know here

23:44.166 --> 23:45.798
with you when
you take this journey.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.200
Well, you're here.

23:47.235 --> 23:48.668
But I don't know you.

23:48.703 --> 23:51.704
Already told you,
Joshua Yang, 21,

23:51.739 --> 23:56.008
dying from bowel cancer, a BA
in Fine Arts. I'm a virgin.

23:56.044 --> 23:58.510
Virgin? What, a goodlooking
lad like you?

23:58.546 --> 24:00.046
How is that possible?

24:00.081 --> 24:01.881
Just never really
happened for me.

24:01.916 --> 24:05.384
I mean, I had my chance
with Kailey Christinziano,

24:05.419 --> 24:08.714
but I messed it up,
because I'm a total idiot,

24:08.739 --> 24:12.491
so now the joke's on me.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.365
- No.
- What?

24:20.401 --> 24:22.067
What are you doing?

24:22.102 --> 24:25.303
- You're not ready, Josh.
- Wh... yes, yes, I am.

24:25.338 --> 24:29.040
I don't want your money,
at least not for now.

24:31.611 --> 24:33.065
Tell your parents.

24:33.090 --> 24:35.324
Tell Kailey Christinwhatever-
hernameis that you like her.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.881
No, it's too late.

24:36.917 --> 24:39.650
Josh, I know this
terrible diagnosis

24:39.686 --> 24:41.885
feels like it's the lowest
of the low.

24:41.921 --> 24:47.692
I get it, but there's still
time for you to learn and grow.

24:47.727 --> 24:51.195
Just go and live a little more.

24:51.231 --> 24:54.232
Get laid, all right?

24:54.267 --> 24:57.067
Okay, what happens
if I can't function anymore?

24:57.103 --> 24:58.268
Well, call me.

24:58.303 --> 25:00.670
I'll happily kill you then.

25:00.706 --> 25:04.875
Besides, when you tell Kailey
that you're dying,

25:04.910 --> 25:08.879
she'll be all over you.

25:08.914 --> 25:10.380
You think?

25:10.415 --> 25:11.949
I know.

25:23.895 --> 25:28.898
She's gone, that beautiful lady.

25:28.933 --> 25:30.800
She was in a lot of pain.

25:30.835 --> 25:33.803
Yeah, I know. It's just...
Just happened so quickly.

25:33.838 --> 25:35.938
Like, one minute she's alive,
she's talking,

25:35.974 --> 25:39.708
and then nothing forever.
It's just...

25:39.744 --> 25:42.444
- It's life.
- You're acting like we didn't

25:42.480 --> 25:43.913
just kill another human being.

25:43.948 --> 25:46.649
Look at you,
not a care in the world.

25:46.684 --> 25:49.151
Of course I care,
but Nicole, I'm a doctor.

25:49.186 --> 25:51.287
You learn how to
compartmentalize. You have to.

25:51.322 --> 25:54.590
This is not about you
being a doctor.

25:54.625 --> 25:55.991
Then what are we talking about?

25:56.026 --> 25:57.092
Mom.

25:59.764 --> 26:02.665
- I knew you'd bring her up.
- This is obviously about her.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.132
What I do is about
helping people.

26:04.168 --> 26:05.733
It's about them.

26:05.769 --> 26:08.270
Did you compartmentalize
your selfawareness?

26:08.305 --> 26:10.272
Mom has everything
to do with this.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.110
It's like you're justifying
the way she died,

26:12.135 --> 26:13.634
just over and over again.

26:13.662 --> 26:16.763
Hey, Sigmund,
stop psychoanalyzing me.

26:16.798 --> 26:18.599
All right, whatever you want
to tell yourself,

26:18.633 --> 26:23.068
but I don't want to be
your launderer or whatever.

26:23.104 --> 26:24.737
I don't want anything
to do with it.

26:24.772 --> 26:26.805
- But Nicole, you were the...
- Aunt Nicole!

26:26.841 --> 26:28.306
Hi.

26:28.342 --> 26:30.308
Hey, little warrior.
How goes the battle?

26:30.344 --> 26:31.844
You know, it goes.

26:31.879 --> 26:34.813
Mom, can Heather stay
for dinner?

26:34.849 --> 26:36.481
Yeah, of course.

26:36.517 --> 26:39.017
Any allergies
I should know about?

26:39.052 --> 26:43.655
Just gluten, dairy,
avocados, and carrots.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.293
I'm kidding. I eat everything.

26:50.164 --> 26:52.797
I'll get it.

26:52.832 --> 26:55.066
You know I love you, right?

26:56.536 --> 26:58.002
And I love you.

26:58.038 --> 27:01.372
And I get that you want
to help people,

27:01.407 --> 27:04.475
but at the end of the day,
like, who is helping you?

27:06.546 --> 27:08.657
- Is your mom home?
- Mom, it's for you.

27:15.087 --> 27:17.721
You got to be kidding me.

27:17.756 --> 27:19.490
Get it out of here.
Just sign here.

27:19.525 --> 27:21.659
I'm not signing anything.
I don't want it!

27:21.694 --> 27:23.394
I'll sign it.

27:23.429 --> 27:25.396
Why does it say,
"Ticktock, Mary?"

27:25.431 --> 27:26.630
What?

27:26.666 --> 27:30.233
I'm sorry, baby.

27:30.268 --> 27:32.368
Who's Olivia?

27:33.505 --> 27:38.742
Just someone playing
a little joke on me. Just go.

27:38.777 --> 27:42.245
It's not that funny.

27:42.280 --> 27:45.415
You know what, Cambie?
You're right.

28:10.843 --> 28:11.843
Hello?

28:17.609 --> 28:19.675
You must be Mary.

28:19.710 --> 28:22.178
Randall, it's nice to meet you.

28:22.213 --> 28:23.479
I want to see Olivia.

28:25.983 --> 28:27.283
Follow me.

28:39.964 --> 28:42.865
I promise you we're ahead
of schedule.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.434
There's nothing to worry about.

28:46.470 --> 28:48.704
My next appointment
just arrived.

28:48.739 --> 28:51.939
I'll be in touch.

28:51.975 --> 28:54.242
Mary, hi.

28:54.278 --> 28:56.077
Found her wandering
around downstairs.

28:56.112 --> 28:58.613
I came to tell you to stop
sending me appliances.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.948
I'm happy with mine.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.787
Randall, will you tell
the boys downstairs

29:05.822 --> 29:07.989
to stop with all the noise?
I can't hear myself think.

29:08.024 --> 29:09.812
Pat, Justin, stop...

29:09.890 --> 29:12.015
Randall, do I not have a voice?

29:12.062 --> 29:13.595
I can stand here
and yell at people.

29:13.631 --> 29:15.497
Okay.

29:15.533 --> 29:18.901
Thank you so much for coming.

29:20.237 --> 29:22.471
I'm not going
to kill your husband.

29:22.506 --> 29:25.307
All right, guys, take a break.

29:25.342 --> 29:28.843
- Do you believe in karma?
- Karma?

29:28.879 --> 29:30.879
You know, what goes around
comes around?

29:30.914 --> 29:32.514
How our actions
manifest themselves

29:32.550 --> 29:34.816
into reciprocal actions
in the future?

29:34.851 --> 29:35.468
Consequences?

29:35.531 --> 29:38.812
- No, I don't believe in karma.
- I didn't think you would.

29:38.837 --> 29:40.114
You're gonna kill
my husband, Mary,

29:40.138 --> 29:41.738
and you're gonna do it tonight.

29:41.773 --> 29:44.608
I already told you
I'm not going to do that.

29:44.643 --> 29:46.076
I'm not a killer.

29:46.111 --> 29:47.611
But that's not what you told me.

29:50.182 --> 29:52.849
In fact, you told me

29:52.884 --> 29:55.785
that you let my brother
bleed out and die,

29:55.821 --> 29:57.954
so whether you believe it
or not,

29:57.989 --> 29:59.789
you brought yourself
to this moment.

30:08.366 --> 30:13.035
Hey, why can't you
just do it yourself?

30:13.070 --> 30:14.604
You're smarter than that, Mary.

30:14.639 --> 30:16.038
Everyone knows the first person

30:16.073 --> 30:18.541
the police suspect
is the spouse.

30:18.576 --> 30:21.277
You'll be a suspect regardless.

30:21.312 --> 30:23.178
Not when you make it
look natural

30:23.214 --> 30:24.980
just like you do
with all your patients.

30:25.015 --> 30:27.717
I can make it look natural
because my patients

30:27.752 --> 30:31.019
are already dying.

30:31.055 --> 30:34.056
You really are a saint, Mary,

30:34.091 --> 30:35.858
helping people die with dignity.

30:37.728 --> 30:39.394
It's like I'm talking to myself.

30:39.429 --> 30:42.697
Randall? Randall?

30:44.868 --> 30:46.568
Did I not ask you
to make them stop?

30:46.603 --> 30:48.403
Yeah, I did.
I'll tell them again.

30:48.438 --> 30:50.171
No, you know what?

30:50.206 --> 30:52.073
Don't bother.

30:52.108 --> 30:54.409
I actually like
the sound of banging.

31:08.124 --> 31:09.556
You were saying?

31:15.098 --> 31:18.332
You already have the gun.

31:18.367 --> 31:22.969
It would be so easy for you
to just kill him yourself.

31:38.420 --> 31:40.908
But I want you
to be my gun, Mary.

31:46.261 --> 31:48.561
Where do I go?

31:49.898 --> 31:53.700
It's the alarm code
to my house, 2009.

31:53.735 --> 31:55.267
It's the year my daughter
was born.

31:56.604 --> 31:59.405
It goes by so fast.

31:59.441 --> 32:01.808
How old's your youngest?
She's around 12?

32:01.843 --> 32:05.578
Yeah. We should have
a playdate sometime.

32:06.981 --> 32:07.880
That's funny. You're funny.

32:07.915 --> 32:09.748
I like that.

32:11.919 --> 32:15.387
Travis will be home
by 7:00, drunk.

32:15.422 --> 32:17.723
He'll pour himself one more rum
and Coke and then pass out

32:17.758 --> 32:20.726
in front of the TV by 8:00.

32:20.761 --> 32:22.995
Make it look like
a heart attack,

32:23.030 --> 32:26.498
whatever it is you normally do,

32:26.533 --> 32:28.834
and I'll expect you
back here around 9:30.

32:53.293 --> 32:57.528
- What's your cat's name?
- This is Casper the Second.

32:57.563 --> 32:59.663
- The Second?
- Yes.

32:59.699 --> 33:03.534
- How does that work?
- Long story short,

33:03.569 --> 33:06.103
my mom's a liar.

33:06.138 --> 33:10.474
Okay, long story long this time?

33:10.510 --> 33:14.278
Um, last year my mom
told me and Cambie

33:14.313 --> 33:15.612
that she had to put our cat

33:15.647 --> 33:17.614
Casper down
because he had cancer.

33:17.649 --> 33:19.816
I am so sorry. That's the worst.

33:19.851 --> 33:21.351
No, don't be,

33:21.387 --> 33:23.120
because then this cat
comes along

33:23.155 --> 33:26.957
who happens to look exactly
like Casper the original.

33:26.992 --> 33:30.059
- I don't get it.
- Yeah, neither did Cambie.

33:30.094 --> 33:32.995
She thought that he was
a totally different cat

33:33.031 --> 33:35.164
sent to us from the gods.

33:35.199 --> 33:38.968
We named him Casper the Second,
and, yeah,

33:39.003 --> 33:42.238
but you never died,
did you, Casper?

33:42.273 --> 33:44.741
Why would your mom
lie about that?

33:44.776 --> 33:46.175
I don't know.

33:46.210 --> 33:50.212
It's pathological, I think.

33:51.849 --> 33:55.217
You really let people
affect you, don't you?

33:55.253 --> 33:56.685
Well, yeah.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.555
She's my mom, so she affects me.

33:59.590 --> 34:03.011
- Same with Naomi.
- What do you mean?

34:03.074 --> 34:06.875
Is there something
between you two?

34:06.911 --> 34:11.880
Yeah, there used to be,
but it's... it's over.

34:11.916 --> 34:15.851
I've... I've moved on.

34:15.886 --> 34:18.387
To who?

34:31.469 --> 34:36.071
I like you, Jess.

34:36.106 --> 34:39.074
Are you lying? I can't tell.

34:39.109 --> 34:42.743
No, no.

35:12.441 --> 35:13.693
Hello?

36:35.555 --> 36:37.921
Honey, I'm home.

36:49.602 --> 36:52.535
You want a drink, man?

36:52.571 --> 36:56.439
Yeah, you know it, buddy.

37:12.319 --> 37:14.453
Where it all began.

37:14.489 --> 37:16.754
I'm far less original
than I like to think I am.

37:16.790 --> 37:21.093
No, no, you are
definitely an original.

37:21.128 --> 37:22.794
Look, I'm only here

37:22.829 --> 37:24.762
'cause I'm hoping to talk
some sense into you.

37:24.798 --> 37:27.099
I didn't call you for sense.
I'll have a vodka martini,

37:27.134 --> 37:29.634
dirty, no olives,
and the Aussie will have?

37:29.669 --> 37:32.471
Brit, I'm British.

37:32.506 --> 37:37.174
I'll have a Shirley Temple,
straight.

37:37.210 --> 37:39.176
Don't go through with this.

37:39.212 --> 37:43.180
Don't kill your husband.

37:43.216 --> 37:46.851
Do you ever feel like
you're a bad person?

37:46.887 --> 37:51.222
I do bad things sometimes,

37:51.257 --> 37:52.723
but am I a bad person?

37:52.758 --> 37:57.561
I... I don't know.
I'd like to think not.

37:57.596 --> 37:59.663
What about you?

37:59.698 --> 38:02.033
Your brother Grady, there's
someone I bet was born bad.

38:02.068 --> 38:05.336
If my parents were here,
they would disagree with you.

38:05.371 --> 38:06.837
He was their pride and joy.

38:10.668 --> 38:14.904
Don't say a word.

38:14.947 --> 38:17.625
- Hi, Puffin.
- <i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

38:17.650 --> 38:19.082
<i>I wanted to say good night.</i>

38:19.117 --> 38:22.585
<i>Guess what.
Gran made breakfast for dinner.</i>

38:22.620 --> 38:24.687
- Lucky girl.
<i>- But I miss you.</i>

38:24.722 --> 38:26.222
<i>Will I see you tomorrow?</i>

38:26.258 --> 38:28.258
- You sure will.
<i>- Promise?</i>

38:28.293 --> 38:31.694
I promise.

38:31.729 --> 38:34.897
Okay, sweetie, Mommy's got
to go now, but I love you,

38:34.933 --> 38:37.167
I love you,
I love you, love you, love you.

38:37.202 --> 38:39.635
- Mwah!
- <i>Bye.</i>

38:44.776 --> 38:48.410
- What?
- You love your daughter,

38:48.446 --> 38:50.279
so maybe don't kill her father.

38:50.314 --> 38:52.114
He's not her father,

38:54.652 --> 38:57.586
And he could already
be dead for all I know.

38:57.621 --> 38:59.888
What?

39:01.225 --> 39:03.892
I'm having my husband
killed right now.

39:06.663 --> 39:10.014
- Who?
- Dr. Mary Harris.

39:16.673 --> 39:18.439
Don't you dare touch me!

39:18.475 --> 39:21.743
- What the... I didn't...
- I am a married woman.

39:21.778 --> 39:25.213
- What the hell?
- Thanks for the alibi, Des.

39:25.248 --> 39:27.647
It was good to have
someone to talk to.

39:38.361 --> 39:41.929
Wow, this is a nice place
you got here, Travis.

39:41.964 --> 39:43.740
Thank you.

39:47.536 --> 39:51.505
Keep this party going.

39:51.540 --> 39:53.702
Rum and Coke, yeah?

39:56.545 --> 40:01.081
I'm more... more of a bourbon
man, myself, if you've got it.

40:01.117 --> 40:04.484
Great, more rum for me.

40:07.623 --> 40:09.838
A bourbon man?

40:21.202 --> 40:25.104
- Now, that is a cute kid.
- Yeah, stepdaughter.

40:25.140 --> 40:27.882
- Well, is she here?
- Nah, her mother sent her

40:27.937 --> 40:30.882
to her grandma's for the
weekend, thank bloody Christ.

40:30.917 --> 40:33.852
The kid's a little shit.

40:33.887 --> 40:35.219
Your wife's pretty hot though,

40:35.255 --> 40:36.332
if you don't mind me saying.

40:36.356 --> 40:40.892
Looks fade,

40:40.927 --> 40:42.726
I'm telling you, Matt.

40:42.762 --> 40:45.229
Is shit that bad
between you guys or what?

40:45.265 --> 40:50.368
The wife, it's work,
but I got it under control.

40:50.403 --> 40:53.737
Nice. Cheers.

40:58.749 --> 41:04.620
Where's the music, man?

41:06.324 --> 41:10.626
- So what's the work?
- Appliances, wholesale.

41:10.661 --> 41:12.127
Appliances?

41:12.162 --> 41:13.962
Yeah, washing machines, stoves.

41:13.998 --> 41:15.463
You need a new dishwasher?

41:15.499 --> 41:17.465
- No, no, no.
- I'll hook you up.

41:17.501 --> 41:21.537
No, man, I'm... I am good.
I am good.

41:21.572 --> 41:25.373
Hey, would you mind if I?

41:25.409 --> 41:27.208
Do I mind?

41:27.244 --> 41:29.144
Shit, you should have
said something earlier.

41:29.179 --> 41:30.744
Why, you got something harder?

41:30.779 --> 41:32.712
Yeah, man.
Put that hippie shit away.

41:32.748 --> 41:34.814
All right, all right.
What you got?

41:34.850 --> 41:39.520
I got it all, the purest
of pure straight from Colombia.

41:39.555 --> 41:42.322
Colombia? You got connections?

41:42.358 --> 41:45.625
No, I am the connection,
brother.

41:48.764 --> 41:52.065
Wait here. I'll be right back.
