WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.774
BABY, THERE IT IS.
I FOUND IT. I FOUND IT.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.142
THE NEW FINNERTY MOBILE.
COME HERE. COME HERE.

00:08.176 --> 00:12.546
COME HERE. LOOK, LOOK,
DUAL CAM, UH, ALLOY WHEELS,
190 HORSEPOWER...

00:12.580 --> 00:13.647
A PROBE.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.716
BABY, IT'S A SPORTS CAR.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.151
IT'S A GIRL'S CAR.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.752
OH, COME ON.
NO, IT'S NOT.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.088
NO, IT'S A CAR
FOR SOMEONE

00:20.121 --> 00:21.689
WHO WANTS TO LOOK COOL
DRIVING FAST.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.191
SOMEONE NAMED DIANE.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.194
AW, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
OH, COME ON, SEAN.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.162
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO BUY A NEW CAR.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.364
LET'S NOT WASTE IT
ON A CHICK CAR.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.833
COME ON. THE PROBE
IS THE THINKING MAN'S
SPORTS COUPE.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.269
WHICH HE BUYS
FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.072
OH, HEY, CLAUDIA,

00:38.106 --> 00:40.341
DO YOU GOT ANYTHING
THAT TAKES OFF
SHRIMP SAUCE?

00:40.374 --> 00:41.775
YEAH,
IN THE KITCHEN.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.611
ALL RIGHT, DAD.
HOW WAS THE OLD
KNIGHT'S CONVENTION?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.446
AW, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL,

00:45.479 --> 00:47.715
EXCEPT FOR THE CHAPTER
FROM WEHAWKEN.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.418
WHAT A BUNCH OF SNOBS.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.586
OH, HEY. WHAT'S ALL THIS?
YOU LOOKIN' FOR A NEW CAR?

00:52.620 --> 00:53.854
SOMEONE STOLE OUR CAR.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.156
WHAT?

00:55.189 --> 00:57.225
HEY, GRANDPA,
CAN I USE YOUR SWORD

00:57.258 --> 00:59.093
TO STAB
THE CAR STEALERS?

00:59.127 --> 01:01.129
SURE. WHEN
WAS IT STOLEN?

01:01.162 --> 01:04.332
UH, LAST NIGHT.
HENRY, YOU CAN'T USE
YOUR GRANDPA'S SWORD.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.234
CAN I USE
MY OWN SWORD?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.435
DO YOU HAVE A SWORD?

01:08.802 --> 01:11.139
I DON'T
HAVE ONE, NO.

01:11.172 --> 01:14.242
I DO NOT
HAVE A SWORD.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.876
JIMMY, BRING ME
YOUR SWORD.

01:15.909 --> 01:20.114
NICE ONE, MORON.
NOW WE'RE COMPLETELY
DEFENSELESS.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.383
SO HOW WAS THE CAR STOLEN?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.586
IT WAS THE WILDEST THING.
CLAUD AND I WERE COMING HOME
FROM A PARTY LAST NIGHT,

01:25.619 --> 01:26.854
ALL RIGHT,
AND WE'RE WALKIN' UP,

01:26.887 --> 01:28.122
AND RIGHT IN FRONT
OF THE HOUSE...

01:30.624 --> 01:33.527
THAT'S, LIKE,
THE FIRST PARTY WE'VE
GONE TO IN 2 YEARS

01:33.561 --> 01:35.563
WHERE THERE WASN'T
A GOODY BAG.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.131
IT WAS FUN
FOR TIMMY KEEKS.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.266
EVERY TIME
I LOOKED OVER,

01:38.299 --> 01:39.467
HE WAS UNDRESSING YOU
WITH HIS EYES.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.734
YEAH, AND WHEN YOU
WEREN'T LOOKIN',

01:40.768 --> 01:42.203
HE WAS DOIN' IT
WITH HIS HANDS.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.771
YOU CAN'T BLAME THE MAN.
LOOK AT YOU, BABY.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.406
Both: MMM.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.179
BABY, YOU LEFT
THE LIGHTS TO THE CAR ON.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.280
MMM, NO, I DIDN'T.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.681
YEAH, WELL,
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T.

01:54.682 --> 01:59.187
WH--HEY!
HEY! YOU! AAH!

02:00.188 --> 02:01.489
BABY, NO!
WHOO! WHOO!

02:01.522 --> 02:04.292
THAT'S OUR CAR,
SEAN!
OH, OH, CRAP!

02:04.325 --> 02:05.326
AAH!

02:19.673 --> 02:21.942
HOW CAN THERE BE
THIS MANY CLAIM FORMS
FOR ONE CRAPPY OLD CAR?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.412
I DON'T KNOW. OK,
WHAT WAS THE VIN NUMBER?

02:24.445 --> 02:28.882
UH, 339XZG15490.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.751
REALLY?

02:30.784 --> 02:33.521
I DON'T KNOW
THE FRIGGIN' VIN NUMBER.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.889
OH, MAN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE

02:35.923 --> 02:38.959
YOU GUYS LEFT YOUR NEW
GOLF CLUBS IN THERE.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.628
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY GOLF CLUBS.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.463
NOT ANY MORE.
YOU LEFT THEM IN THE CAR.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.398
CAR GOT STOLEN.
I'D PUT IT DOWN.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.599
OH, COME ON. LOOK,
I'M NOT GONNA--

02:45.633 --> 02:47.601
I'M NOT GONNA LIE
TO THE INSURANCE
COMPANY.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.470
I'M NOT TALKIN' ABOUT LYING.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.339
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT GETTIN'
WHAT'S COMIN' TO YOU.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.940
EVERYBODY DOES IT.
YOU'VE BEEN PAYIN' FOR IT,

02:52.973 --> 02:54.542
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO GET PAID.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.677
NO.
YOU KNOW, THOUGH,

02:56.710 --> 02:58.812
WE DO PAY THEM A LOT
OF MONEY EVERY MONTH,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.614
AND THEN
EVERY TIME WE GET
INTO A FENDER BENDER,

03:00.648 --> 03:01.749
WE NEVER EVEN REPORT IT

03:01.782 --> 03:03.351
BECAUSE THEN
OUR PREMIUMS WILL GO UP.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.618
SO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD CHEAT?

03:04.652 --> 03:06.587
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.522
I'M JUST, YOU KNOW,
SAYING IF WE DID,

03:08.556 --> 03:09.557
NO ONE
COULD BLAME US.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.659
YEAH. IT'S NOT HUGE THINGS.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.261
I'M JUST TALKIN' BENDING.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.629
HERE, WHERE IT SAYS "RADIO,"
YOU WROTE "YES."

03:15.663 --> 03:19.433
JUST CHANGE "YES"
TO "BLAUPUNKT
20-DISK CD CHANGER."

03:19.467 --> 03:21.869
GUYS, I CAN'T.
I--NO.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.704
WHY?
NO.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.507
MOM, DAD,
JIMMY AND HENRY
ARE DRIVING ME NUTS.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.641
WELL, THEY'RE JUST
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT

03:27.675 --> 03:28.809
ABOUT THE CAR
BEING STOLEN.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.844
STAY OUT OF MY ROOM.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.548
ALL WE WERE TRYING TO DO
WAS BOARD UP YOUR WINDOWS.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.818
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO KEEP OUT,
BURGLARS OR ZOMBIES?

03:37.851 --> 03:40.288
THERE ARE ZOMBIES?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.890
HENRY, HENRY, ZOMBIES
DID NOT STEAL OUR SUBARU.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.826
SO YOU'RE SAYIN'
THERE ARE ZOMBIES?!

03:45.859 --> 03:48.729
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.532
WELL, WHOEVER STOLE
THAT CAR OF YOURS, SEAN,
DID YOU A FAVOR.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.633
IT WAS A PIECE OF JUNK.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.703
AW, COME ON, DAD.
WE HAD GOOD MEMORIES
WITH THAT CAR,

03:55.736 --> 03:56.604
AND WE
TOOK HENRY HOME

03:56.637 --> 03:58.572
FROM THE HOSPITAL
IN THAT CAR,
REMEMBER?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.374
COME ON,
YOU PIECE OF CRAP.
TURN OVER!

04:00.408 --> 04:01.842
DID YOU FLOOD IT?
I'M--I'M SORRY.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.976
I DIDN'T FLOOD IT,
BABY.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.845
I DIDN'T EVEN
TOUCH THE GAS.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.848
JUST--JUST--JUST--
JUST TO SOOTHE
THE BABY, OK,

04:07.881 --> 04:08.949
I GOT IT. I GOT IT!

04:08.982 --> 04:11.585
I LOVED THAT CAR.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.687
HENRY, WE'VE GOT
WORK TO DO.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.390
WELL, DID YOU PUT ON
THAT CLUB I GAVE YOU
FOR CHRISTMAS?

04:16.424 --> 04:17.891
YEAH, DAD. SURE DID.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.928
DID YOU LOCK IT
OR JUST REST IT
ON THE WHEEL?

04:20.961 --> 04:23.497
DAD, DAD, THE CLUB
IS A VISUAL DETERRENT.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.300
THE CROOK SEES THE CLUB
AND JUST MOVES ON.

04:26.334 --> 04:30.538
WELL, IT WORKED, SEANNIE,
'CAUSE HE MOVED ON...

04:30.571 --> 04:31.805
IN YOUR CAR.

04:31.839 --> 04:35.576
DON'T FORGET
TO WRITE DOWN CLUB.
DELUXE CLUB.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.079
OH, COME ON, SEANNIE.
WE WORK HARD,

04:39.112 --> 04:40.648
AND WHAT DO
WE GET FOR IT, HUH?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.416
OUR ICE MAKER'S LEAKING,

04:42.450 --> 04:46.354
AND THAT SPINNEY THING
IN THE MICROWAVE
JUST TWITCHES.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.322
WE DESERVE SOMETHING
SHINY AND NEW.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.957
OK, SO YOU DO THINK
WE SHOULD CHEAT?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.425
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.527
I JUST SAID
WE SHOULD EXPLORE
ALL AVENUES.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.828
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

04:54.862 --> 04:57.631
WE TOOK A LITTLE STROLL
DOWN AVENUE EDDIE, HUH...

04:57.665 --> 04:59.867
ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY
WHEN HE CONVINCED ME

04:59.900 --> 05:03.070
TO BUY THAT BIG SCREEN TV
AND PUT IT ON MY CREDIT CARD?

05:03.103 --> 05:05.439
Sean: OH, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS, EDDIE.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.341
DON'T WORRY.
IT COSTS YOU NOTHIN'.

05:07.375 --> 05:11.078
WE BRING IT BACK TOMORROW,
GET THE MONEY ON YOUR CARD,
NO ONE'S THE WISER.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.113
I DON'T KNOW.
THE PICTURE'S AWESOME.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.782
OH, OH, OH!

05:14.815 --> 05:16.717
WAIT! HE FUMBLED!
OH, JUMP ON IT!

05:16.750 --> 05:18.452
OH!

05:18.486 --> 05:20.020
YOU BUM!

05:23.957 --> 05:26.727
HEY, THAT FUMBLE
COST ME A LOT OF MONEY.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.930
OH, SEE, SEE?
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
WHEN YOU TRUST EDDIE.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.634
YEAH, RIGHT. UM, SEAN?
DO--DO YOU HAVE
THE SPARE CAR KEYS?

05:33.667 --> 05:34.802
WHAT GOOD
WOULD THEY DO US?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.504
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.372
WHAT?

05:38.406 --> 05:40.941
SOMEONE MUST HAVE
COME INTO OUR HOUSE
AND TAKEN THEM.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.110
WHAT? THEY WERE
IN OUR HOUSE?

05:43.143 --> 05:44.945
WAIT,
THE ZOMBIES WERE
IN OUR HOUSE?

05:44.978 --> 05:46.814
WHAT'S THE NUMBER
OF THAT DETECTIVE
YOU CALLED?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.148
IT'S ON THE FRIDGE.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.917
OK, NOTHING--
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,
ALL RIGHT?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.485
W-WE'RE GONNA
CHANGE ALL THE LOCKS,

05:51.519 --> 05:52.886
AND THE POLICE WILL JUST
FIGURE OUT WHO DID THIS.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.854
WE'LL JUST
CALL THE POLICE.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.824
NO, NO, NO!
DON'T, DON'T! UM...
CAN I PLEASE

05:56.857 --> 06:00.661
TALK TO YOU GUYS
IN THE OTHER ROOM
FOR JUST A SECOND?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.938
NOT ALL OF YOU.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.574
OK, JEEZ.

06:15.876 --> 06:16.844
WHAT'S UP, LIL?

06:16.877 --> 06:19.046
I TOOK THE KEYS.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.414
YOU DID?

06:20.448 --> 06:21.915
I THINK THIS WHOLE THING
IS MY FAULT.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.116
OK, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.518
WELL, SEE,

06:24.552 --> 06:25.919
BRAD CAME OVER

06:25.953 --> 06:27.488
AND WE WERE JUST
HANGIN' AROUND,

06:27.521 --> 06:28.756
LOOKIN' FOR

06:31.492 --> 06:33.694
WATCH THIS. I'M GONNA

06:37.565 --> 06:39.667
IT'S RINGING.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.201
HELLO?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.637
THAT WAS GREAT!

06:47.708 --> 06:50.410
YEAH.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.048
YOU KNOW, I MADE YOU
A MIXED TAPE.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.550
YOU DID?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.924
BRAD, WHY DO WE HAVE
TO LISTEN TO THIS
IN THE CAR?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.859
'CAUSE IT WAS ORIGINALLY
RECORDED IN THE CAR.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.894
NO, IT WASN'T.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.128
SHH.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.831
* GIRL, YOU KNOW
I LOVE YOU *

I GUESS I'D HAVE TO.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.670

07:53.607 --> 07:56.109

07:56.143 --> 07:58.879
OH, LILY, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKIN'?

07:58.912 --> 08:01.014
SHE WASN'T THINKIN', BABE.
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS THINKIN'.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.850
OH...
I'M SORRY.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.884
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.885
YEAH, YEAH, IT IS.

08:04.918 --> 08:05.886
Claudia:
OK, OK, OK, LOOK,

08:05.919 --> 08:08.155
THAT WAS A REALLY,
REALLY CARELESS
THING TO DO,

08:08.188 --> 08:09.790
BUT THE FACT
THAT YOU CAME CLEAN
ABOUT IT

08:09.823 --> 08:12.826
SHOWS REAL MATURITY,
RIGHT

08:12.860 --> 08:15.896
OH, OK. IT WAS
AN HONEST MISTAKE,

08:15.929 --> 08:17.965
BUT NEXT TIME,
YOU GOTTA
BE MORE CAREFUL.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.534
I WILL. I'M SORRY.
OK.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.140
HEY, LILY.
HEY, MR. AND MRS. FINNERTY.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.678
IT'S OK, BRAD.
I TOLD THEM WHAT WE DID.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.746
OH, CRAP!
NO, NO, NO, NO!

08:34.147 --> 08:35.115
IT'S OK.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.116
DON'T WORRY, BRAD.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.117
WE'RE COOL.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.118
MY DAD'S RIGHT.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.687
YOU GUYS
ARE ULTRA-LIBERALS.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.291
HEY, LOOK.
IT TURNS OUT

08:44.324 --> 08:45.959
YOU GUYS HAD
A STATE-OF-THE-ART
SKI RACK.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.061
OK, ERASE THAT, PLEASE.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.230
COME ON, SEANNIE.
I WANT A NEW CAR.

08:50.263 --> 08:54.234
WE DESERVE IT.
PLEASE, PLEASE,
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,

08:54.267 --> 08:56.536
DON'T MAKE ME GO BACK
TO BIG PETE'S HOUSE OF DEALS.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.740
OH, YEAH, I'VE SEEN
THOSE COMMERCIALS.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.343
KING OF DEALS,
WEARIN' THAT CROWN.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.746
LOOKS LIKE AN IDIOT.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.248
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.584
BABY,
THIS IS THE CAR.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.920
NO WAY. YOU GOT
TO PICK OUR LAST CAR.
IT'S MY TURN.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.756
OH, COME ON. THAT WAS
10 YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD,
LIKE, 600 BUCKS.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.025
ALL RIGHT, IN 2011
YOU'RE UP AGAIN.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.059
YOU CAN GET
A ROCKET CAR.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.294
OH, COME ON, NOW.
UH, OH-OH.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.863
WHAT?
THERE'S
A SALESMAN COMING.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.831
OH, DAMN.
HAS HE SEEN US?

09:23.864 --> 09:26.099
I DON'T KNOW.
UH, LET'S MAKE
A BREAK FOR IT.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.234
OK.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.738
CAN I HELP
YOU FOLKS?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.105
AAH! AAH!

09:32.139 --> 09:34.041
UH, NO.
NOT REALLY.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.709
I'M DAVE.
YOU ARE?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.077
UH, MONTY.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.278
THIS IS MY WIFE
PATRICE.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.880
HI.
MONTY AND PATRICE,

09:39.913 --> 09:42.215
HOW CAN I PUT YOU
IN A PRE-OWNED VEHICLE
TODAY?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.917
W-WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING USED,

09:43.951 --> 09:44.952
BUT NOT TOO--
WE HAVE ONE

09:44.985 --> 09:46.153
OF THE LARGEST
SELECTIONS

09:46.186 --> 09:47.387
OF PRE-OWNED VEHICLES
IN THE TRISTATE AREA.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.089
YOU MEAN,
THEY'RE USED?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.390
OH, SIR, OUR SELECTION
DOES NOT JUST INCLUDE
THE PRE-OWNED,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.059
WE ALSO HAVE
A LARGE NUMBER
OF LEASE RETURNS.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.794
OH, OK, SO,
THEY'RE ALSO USED.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.995
I CAN ASSURE YOU,
THE LEASED RETURNS

09:55.028 --> 09:56.196
AND THE PRE-OWNEDS ARE
COMPLETELY CERTIFIED.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.765
HOW AM I GONNA GET
YOU TO SAY "USED?"

09:57.798 --> 09:59.767
THAT'S NOT A WORD
WE LIKE HERE.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.869
ALL RIGHT,
AT LEAST ADMIT
THAT THEY'RE CARS.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.638
YOU MEAN THE VEHICLES?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.775
SO YOU'RE SAYING
WE SHOULD CHEAT?

10:07.808 --> 10:11.244
NO, I'M NOT SAYING
WE SHOULD CHEAT.
I'M JUST SAYING...

10:11.278 --> 10:13.847
YES, I'M SAYING
WE SHOULD CHEAT...

10:13.881 --> 10:15.415
BUT ONLY ENOUGH
FOR A REASONABLE
DOWN PAYMENT.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.084
EVERYBODY DOES IT,
RIGHT?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.285
I MEAN,
THE SYSTEM OWES US.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.087
BABE, WE ARE
THE VICTIMS HERE.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.221
SOMEONE STOLE OUR CAR.

10:21.254 --> 10:24.324
WHY--WHY, OK,
SHOULD WE BE PUNISHED
FOR BEING HONEST?

10:24.357 --> 10:25.893
WE SHOULDN'T.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.327
WE DESERVE A NICE THING
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.395
EDDIE, PAD AWAY.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.997
I'M ON IT, BROTHER.
ALL RIGHT.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.365
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOVE YOU, MONTY.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.967
I LOVE YOU, PATRICE.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.136
MMM, AW, BABY.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.238
20-CD...

10:46.313 --> 10:48.181
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

10:52.019 --> 10:54.722
OH, MY. WHAT THE?
WHAT THE--OH, JEEZ.
THE DOOR--

10:54.755 --> 10:55.923

10:55.956 --> 10:57.190
UH, WHAT THE? Y-YEAH.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.692
GOOD NEWS.
WE FOUND YOUR CAR.

10:58.726 --> 10:59.727
DAMN IT!

11:00.293 --> 11:01.661
THANK YOU.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.964
IT WAS ABANDONED
OVER ON VICTORY.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.066
W-WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL
WOULD DO THIS?

11:06.099 --> 11:07.200
I GOTTA GO.
NO, BRAD...

11:07.234 --> 11:09.269
I GOTTA GO!
BRAD!

11:20.513 --> 11:21.849
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
BRAD.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.250
THAT CAR'S
TOTALLY TRASHED!

11:23.283 --> 11:24.985
I'M SORRY.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.419
ALL RIGHT, BRAD.
WHY? WHY DID
YOU DO IT?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.188
I DON'T KNOW.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.757
DID YOU THINK
YOU COULD GET AWAY
WITH IT?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.224
I DON'T KNOW!

11:31.258 --> 11:33.193
WE WANT
SOME ANSWERS, BRAD.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.228
I DON'T HAVE ANY!

11:35.262 --> 11:37.030
HEY, HEY, HEY,
ENOUGH OF THAT.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.099
OH!
ENOUGH OF THAT!
HEY!

11:39.132 --> 11:40.734
HE'S STONEWALLING.

11:40.768 --> 11:41.869
I'M--I'M BAD,
THAT'S ALL.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.970
I'M JUST A BAD SEED.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.372
YEAH, HE'S PART
OF THAT NEW BREED
OF SUPERPREDATOR.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.374
HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING
BUT HIMSELF.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.909
YEAH.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.512
WHAT?
BRAD STOLE OUR CAR?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.981
HOW CAN WE DEFEND
AGAINST THAT?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.016
HE'S THE LAST PERSON
I'D SUSPECT.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.184
YEAH,
YOU'RE SO NICE.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.119
PLUS, YOU'RE SUCH
A DOOFUS.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.120
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHOA, WHOA.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.488
I DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T GET IT.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.123
SO, SO,
SO AFTER LILY
WENT INSIDE,

12:03.156 --> 12:04.457
YOU JUST DROVE OFF
IN OUR CAR?

12:04.491 --> 12:06.026
BACK IN THE HOUSE?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.360
AFTER YOU MADE OUT.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.462
WE MADE OUT?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.465
DID IT MEAN
THAT LITTLE TO YOU?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.434
HOW INSULTING!
GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE, NOW!

12:14.467 --> 12:16.136
WHOA, BRAD.
STICK AROUND.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.906
LILY, WHAT IS GOING ON?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.874
BRAD CONFESSED.
WHY--WHY--WHY--WHY
DON'T WE JUST MOVE ON?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.142
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

12:22.175 --> 12:25.846
UH-UH-UH-UH-UH.
OH-HO-HO...

12:26.847 --> 12:27.948
DID YOU DO THIS?

12:27.981 --> 12:30.250
WHOA. WHERE
DID THAT COME FROM?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.119
OH, BUT YOU DID
DO THIS!

12:33.186 --> 12:35.122
I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.423
WE DIDN'T
MEAN ANY HARM.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.258
SO YOUR WHOLE STORY
WAS A CROCK?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.260
NOT THE WHOLE STORY.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.195
IT'S RINGING.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.296
HELLO?

12:43.330 --> 12:46.934
OH, THAT WAS GREAT!

12:46.967 --> 12:49.803
OH, MAN, THEY'RE--
THEY'RE STAR 69ing US.
WHAT DO WE DO?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.441
OH, BOY, BRAD.
THAT WAS A ROLLER
COASTER RIDE!

12:54.474 --> 12:56.243
I KNOW. MY LEGS
ARE STILL SHAKING.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.479
WELL.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.448
HEY, YOU HAVE
YOUR LEARNER'S
PERMIT, DON'T YOU?

13:01.481 --> 13:02.449
YEAH.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.851
LET'S TAKE
MY DAD'S CAR

13:03.884 --> 13:04.952
AND GO FOR BURGERS.

13:04.985 --> 13:08.088
UH, I'M ONLY
ALLOWED TO DRIVE
WITH A LICENSED DRIVER.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.290
WELL, THAT'S OK.
I'LL DRIVE,

13:10.323 --> 13:11.491
AND IF WE GET
PULLED OVER,

13:11.524 --> 13:12.993
WE'LL JUST
SWITCH SEATS.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.095
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.129
DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE SENSE,

13:16.163 --> 13:18.098
OR DO YOU WANT
TO BE WITH ME?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.266
HA!

13:19.299 --> 13:21.101
Brad: BRAKE,
BRAKE...
Lily: WHOO!

13:21.134 --> 13:23.136
BRAKE, BRAKE, BRAKE!

13:23.170 --> 13:25.105
STOP! BRAKE IT!
BRAKE!

13:25.138 --> 13:27.174
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.175
YEAH.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.877
OK, GIVE ME MONEY.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.180
THERE.
THANK YOU.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.148
AH.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.118
MMM.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.157
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

13:46.026 --> 13:50.297
GET OFF OF ME!
GOD! OOH! OOH!

13:50.330 --> 13:51.364
Both: OH, MY GOD!

13:51.398 --> 13:53.100
OH, MY, NOT,
UH, NOT GOOD.

13:53.133 --> 13:53.967
MAYBE WE CAN
STICK IT BACK ON.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.303
OK, OK, YEAH.
I'LL GET IT.
I'LL GET IT.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.971
AAH!

14:00.373 --> 14:03.043
OOH. OH, MAN. OH, GOD.
OH, MAN. OH, GOD.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.511
OH, MAN, OH, GOD.
OH, MAN, OH, GOD. OH, MAN.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.080
WE'RE DEAD.
WE'RE GOIN' TO JAIL,
AND WE'RE DEAD.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.215
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE COOL. WE'RE COOL.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.549
WE CAN HANDLE THIS, OK?

14:09.582 --> 14:12.185
STOP HONKING AT ME!

14:24.631 --> 14:27.234
WHAT POSSIBLY
COULD HAVE GOTTEN
INTO YOUR HEAD?

14:27.267 --> 14:30.170
WE WERE SO HUNGRY,
AND THERE WAS NO FOOD
IN THIS HOUSE.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.271
OH, THERE WAS FOOD
IN THE HOUSE.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.040
THERE WEREN'T
ANY HAMBURGERS.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.908
YOU DESTROYED
OUR CAR!

14:34.942 --> 14:36.176
ISN'T THIS THE TIME
WHERE YOU SAY

14:36.209 --> 14:37.911
"THANK GOD
YOU'RE NOT HURT?"

14:37.945 --> 14:39.112
WE KNEW
YOU WEREN'T HURT.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.014
YOU'VE BEEN WALKIN'
AROUND THE HOUSE
ALL DAY.

14:41.048 --> 14:46.419
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
CAN'T WE ALL JUST AGREE
IT'S SPANKIN' TIME?

14:48.088 --> 14:50.190
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.059
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
TO TRY AND FIX IT.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.028
I EVEN CALLED
THE ONE PERSON I KNEW
WHO COULD HELP US.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.897
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.634
OH, IT'S NO BIG THING.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.171
THANK YOU, UNCLE EDDIE.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.440
UNCLE EDDIE?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.709
FIRST OF ALL,
YOUR DAUGHTER
CAME TO ME.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.578
SHE WAS A MESS.
SHE WAS NEVER GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.147
OH, WE DON'T WANT HER
TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.348
COME ON.
LOOK AT--LOOK AT
THAT LITTLE FACE.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.184
HOW COULD I SAY NO?

15:17.217 --> 15:18.651
AND I JUST HAPPEN
TO HAVE FRIENDS
WHO CAN FIX THINGS.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.089
YO, VINCE!

15:24.557 --> 15:26.059
OUT OF THE WAY.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.228
VINCENZO.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.398
ED.
ALL RIGHT.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.632
ALL RIGHT.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.574
VINCE HERE

15:41.608 --> 15:43.610
HE'S GONNA HOOK YOU UP
WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.248
HEY, THERE.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.051
Eddie: VINCE,

15:51.084 --> 15:52.119
THAT'S MY NIECE.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.323
HELLO.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.993
HEH.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.461
WHERE DO YOU FIND
THESE PEOPLE?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.264
THEY FIND ME.

16:05.665 --> 16:10.037
YOU TOOK A LITTLE GIRL
TO A CHOP SHOP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.704
HEY, VINCE
IS GOOD PEOPLE.

16:11.738 --> 16:12.639
OH, HOW SO?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.541
HEY,
HE HOOKED US UP.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.213
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

16:23.716 --> 16:24.784
THIS DOOR JUST CAME IN.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.254
YOU GUYS
ARE LUCKY.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.656
A LOT LUCKIER
THAN THE PEOPLE
WHO OWNED IT.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.690
THEY'RE DEAD.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.228
OH, GOD.
NOW, I FEEL BAD.

16:35.262 --> 16:38.331
NO, NO. I'M SURE THEY'D
WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.668
HERE'S YOUR MIRROR.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.804
OH, WHAT?
THIS MIRROR IS HUGE.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.640
ACTUALLY, IT'S SMALLER
THAN IT APPEARS.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.245
HEY...

16:53.180 --> 16:54.681
THE BACK SEAT
IS GONE!

16:54.714 --> 16:58.318
NO WAY. WE WERE
ONLY GONE FOR 5 MINUTES.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.188
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
SALVAGED IT.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.792
HEY, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR PEOPLE'S
PERSONAL PROPERTY.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.627
IT SAYS SO ON THE THING
YOU'RE GONNA SIGN.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.496
WE'RE NOT GONNA
SIGN THAT.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.764
OH, YOU'RE GONNA
SIGN IT, PRETTY BOY.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.765
YOU'RE GONNA SIGN IT.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.401
ALL RIGHT, VINCE.
BACK OFF.

17:16.403 --> 17:20.540
OH, MY GOD.
DAD IS GONNA FREAK
WHEN HE SEES THAT BACK SEAT.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.808
IT'S COOL.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.210
IT'S A FUTON.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.379
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S ERGONOMIC.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.684
OK, OK, NEW PLAN.

17:31.718 --> 17:32.785
YOU'RE GONNA
DITCH THE CAR

17:32.819 --> 17:34.254
AND SAY
IT WAS STOLEN.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.288
WHAT?

17:36.423 --> 17:39.192
GUESS WE'RE GONNA
DITCH THE CAR
AND SAY IT WAS STOLEN.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.394
OK, OK.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.600
Lily: OH, NO.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.238
MOM AND DAD ARE BACK.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.373
STEP ON IT.
GO!

17:53.406 --> 17:56.209
Sean: THEY TOOK MY--
THAT'S MY--HEY!

17:59.479 --> 18:01.814
DON'T PANIC!
DON'T PANIC!

18:01.848 --> 18:03.650
PANIC IS COUNTER
PRODUCTIVE!

18:03.683 --> 18:07.587
BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP.
BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.588
CUT IT.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.623
CUT IT! CUT IT!

18:12.792 --> 18:15.128
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME
SAY "CUT IT?"

18:15.162 --> 18:17.264
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.274
HOW? HOW COULD
YOU HELP HER?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.242
HEY, I'M THE GOOD
GUY HERE.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.377
YOU ARE?

18:30.410 --> 18:31.478
HOW ARE YOU
THE GOOD GUY?

18:31.511 --> 18:33.213
I HELPED
YOUR DAUGHTER
OUT OF A JAM.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.514
I TRIED
TO DO YOU GUYS
A FAVOR.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.749
YOU DID?
HEY, YOU WANTED
A NEW CAR.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.850
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE GUTS TO DO

18:37.884 --> 18:39.286
WHAT NEEDED
TO BE DONE
TO GET IT.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.621
I DID. THOSE ARE
THE THINGS I DO.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.891
THOSE DIRTY
LITTLE DETAILS

18:44.924 --> 18:46.326
THAT YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT

18:46.359 --> 18:47.760
IN YOUR PERFECT
LITTLE SUBURBAN

18:47.794 --> 18:49.796
WHITE PICKET FENCE
PARADISE.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.500
YOU LIVE, LIKE,
3 BLOCKS FROM HERE.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.403
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.376
DAD, CAN WE TAKE BRAD
DOWN TO THE BASEMENT
AND DO THINGS TO HIM?

19:03.410 --> 19:05.178
NO!

19:05.212 --> 19:06.179
COME ON. I MEAN,

19:06.213 --> 19:07.414
WE GOTTA MAKE HIM CONFESS,
RIGHT?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.549
HE ALREADY CONFESSED.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.684
THERE'S GOTTA BE
OTHER STUFF.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.320
KID'S GOT A POINT.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.621
NO, COME ON, GUYS.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.456
HEY, HENRY, JIMMY,
GET UPSTAIRS,
ALL RIGHT,

19:16.489 --> 19:17.624
AND EDDIE, GET YOUR
BUTT OUT THERE

19:17.657 --> 19:19.492
AND START
FIXING THAT CAR.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.494
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING
FOR THIS FAMILY.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.264
MR. FINNERTY,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.498
PLEASE DON'T SEND ME
TO A GROUP HOME.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.300
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE JUST GONNA

19:27.334 --> 19:29.336
GO HAVE A LITTLE SIT-DOWN
WITH YOUR OLD MAN.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.871
HE'S GONNA KICK MY ASS!

19:31.904 --> 19:34.474
THAT SALAD SHOOTER?
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE STONES.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.343
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.445
YEAH, I'LL EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU ON THE WAY OUT.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.746
HOW, HOW,
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

19:39.779 --> 19:40.747
WHAT?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.582
WHAT? DESTROY OUR CAR,

19:42.615 --> 19:44.517
ENDANGER YOUR LIFE,
AND LIE ABOUT IT.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.487
SEE? THIS--THIS IS WHY
I DON'T TELL YOU THINGS

19:47.520 --> 19:49.356
BECAUSE--
BECAUSE YOU OVERREACT.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.424
OH, I AM NOT
OVERREACTING.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.860
THE APPROPRIATE REACTION
WOULD BE TO SWING YOU AROUND
BY YOUR HAIR.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.764
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU ACT THIS WAY,

19:57.797 --> 19:58.831
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL

19:58.865 --> 20:00.333
LIKE NEXT TIME
I DO SOMETHING WRONG,

20:00.367 --> 20:01.534
I SHOULD LIE ABOUT IT.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.536
S-SO...

20:03.570 --> 20:05.405
PUNISHING HER WOULD
JUST MAKE THINGS WORSE.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.939
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WOULD.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.608
IT WOULD SEND OUT
THE WRONG SIGNALS.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.277
YEAH, WE'D JUST BE

20:10.310 --> 20:12.245
SHUTTING DOWN THE CHANNELS
OF COMMUNICATION.
RIGHT.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.846
I THINK SO.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.616
YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HMM?

20:16.649 --> 20:17.617
I SAY WE RISK IT.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.618
I'M RIGHT WITH YOU.

20:18.651 --> 20:19.852
MM-HMM.
WHAT?

20:19.886 --> 20:20.853
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'RE GETTING

20:20.887 --> 20:21.888
YOUR LEARNER'S PERMIT
NEXT YEAR?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.356
YEAH?
YOU'RE NOT.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.992
MM-HMM.
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO. COME ON.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.927
ALL OF THE KIDS
ARE GONNA BE
DRIVING TO SCHOOL.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.296
I'M GONNA
LOOK LIKE A LOSER.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.031
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK COOL
BECAUSE, DON'T WORRY,

20:32.064 --> 20:35.535
'CAUSE EVERY DAY
I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU TO SCHOOL
IN THE FUTON-MOBILE.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.907
THAT--THAT'S OK.
THAT'S OK. I'LL WALK.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.542
NO, YOU WON'T.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.011
OHHHH!

20:48.348 --> 20:50.450
ONLY 3 MORE YEARS.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.285
OH, TILL SHE GOES
AWAY TO COLLEGE?

20:52.319 --> 20:55.388
NO, UNTIL SHE CAN
BE TRIED AS AN ADULT.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.494
ALL RIGHT.

21:03.963 --> 21:04.964
THIS SHOULD FIT.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.600
OH, W-WAIT A MINUTE.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.436
THAT--THAT HAS POKEMON
STICKERS ON IT.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.970
SO PEEL 'EM OFF.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.306
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S MY CAR SEAT.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.807
YEAH, FOR 75 BUCKS.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.543
NO, YOU DON'T GET IT.
THAT--NO, NO.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.777
THAT SEAT
CAME OUT OF MY CAR.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.812
OH, GREAT. WE KNOW
IT'S GONNA FIT, THEN.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.482
HEY, I'M NOT PAYIN'
75 BUCKS FOR THAT.
THAT'S MINE.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.551
OH, YOU'RE GONNA PAY,
HOT LIPS.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.552
YOU'RE GONNA PAY.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.819
COME ON.
HEY, NO, WAIT, WAIT.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.388
W-W-W-WAIT.
HEY! HEY! HEY!

21:28.421 --> 21:30.357
VINCENT, VINCENT.
DON'T--WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.891
HEY!
IT'S BUSINESS.
JUST PAY IT.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.560
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET

21:33.593 --> 21:35.462
A BETTER PRICE
IN TOWN ANYWHERE.
OH.

21:35.495 --> 21:39.532
IT'S COOL, MAN.
WHAT ARE YOU GETTIN'
CRAZY FOR?

21:41.734 --> 21:42.735
I DON'T KNOW.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.372
OK, W

21:46.406 --> 21:48.541
IT'S COMMISSION.
I BRING HIM BUSINESS.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.009
AW, JEEZ.

21:50.042 --> 21:53.346
WHAT? I CAN'T
MAKE A LIVING?

21:55.548 --> 21:57.917
HEY, THAT WAS REALLY COOL
THE WAY YOU PROTECTED ME.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.487
I MEAN, YOU NEVER GAVE UP.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.390
YES, IT'S--IT'S NOT MY...

22:03.423 --> 22:05.692
STYLE?
YEAH.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.427
WELL, THANKS.

22:07.460 --> 22:11.097
NO PROBLEM.
YOU'D DO THE SAME
FOR ME, RIGHT?

22:11.130 --> 22:14.100
YEAH, I GUESS.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.705
YOU WANNA GO
TO THE DANCE NEXT WEEK?

22:18.738 --> 22:19.906
YEAH, OK.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.007
