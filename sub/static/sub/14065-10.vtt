00:00.010 --> 00:01.935
<i>Previously on ‘Boston Legal’...</i>

00:01.935 --> 00:05.084
Claire Simms, this is
Clarice Bell, our client.

00:05.119 --> 00:08.748
Are you kidding me? It's a
big black man in a frock.

00:08.783 --> 00:12.377
This is Dolce & Gabbana,
you pissy little bitch.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.493
I'm Alan Shore, Clarice's lawyer.

00:14.493 --> 00:15.792
Yeah, uh…

00:15.827 --> 00:17.904
Clarice went to the market.

00:17.939 --> 00:19.329
And you would be?…

00:19.364 --> 00:20.214
Clarence.

00:20.249 --> 00:21.868
You gonna hit me, Brad?

00:23.861 --> 00:28.661
One of my goals in life is to go
to all the places you've gone, and…

00:28.696 --> 00:30.401
Just don't go to Shirley.

00:30.436 --> 00:31.362
She's mine.

00:38.229 --> 00:39.548
–Don't talk to me about appointments,
–It's just that without a scheduled appointment

00:39.548 --> 00:41.619
–my husband didn't have an appointment with death!
–there's no one that I can get you in to see.

00:41.619 --> 00:43.794
I am not leaving until
I meet with a lawyer!

00:43.794 --> 00:44.965
What seems to be the matter?

00:44.965 --> 00:47.806
This skinny little thing here won't take
my business because I'm black.

00:47.806 --> 00:48.885
That's what's going on.

00:48.885 --> 00:50.383
I'm sure that's not the case.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.031
Well how would you know,
were you here?

00:52.031 --> 00:52.895
What's going on?

00:52.895 --> 00:55.074
Evidently her husband was
struck and killed by lightning.

00:55.074 --> 00:57.577
She wants to sue God.

00:57.912 --> 01:00.528
Your talking about me, don't think
I don't know you are talking about me.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.063
–Mrs, uh…
–I am not leaving!

01:02.063 --> 01:04.685
You gonna have to bring in
a bulldozer and plow me out.

01:04.685 --> 01:05.982
I'm sure that won't be necessary.

01:05.982 --> 01:06.904
Let me just speak with her.

01:06.904 --> 01:08.663
Absolutely not, anybody but you.

01:08.663 --> 01:10.388
What is that supposed to mean?

01:10.388 --> 01:13.350
I know you, Denise. You'll probably
wind up taking this case.

01:13.350 --> 01:14.945
And what is that supposed to mean?

01:14.945 --> 01:18.071
Where is my lawyer?
Ten seconds and I scream.

01:18.106 --> 01:18.935
No, Please don't do…

01:18.935 --> 01:19.837
One!

01:19.872 --> 01:23.320
OK. Meet with her, but that's it.

01:23.355 --> 01:28.567
Brad, go with Denise, make sure
she does not take this case.

01:31.572 --> 01:32.993
Alan!

01:33.028 --> 01:34.942
Shirley, I was just thinking of you.

01:34.942 --> 01:36.009
Were you now?

01:36.044 --> 01:40.447
Well, not you specifically,
your doll.

01:40.482 --> 01:44.673
I thought I ought to put in some hard hours
practicing with her in preparation

01:44.673 --> 01:48.127
for finding you under the mistletoe
at the Christmas party

01:48.127 --> 01:50.807
and stemming your yuletide with
my skilled and darting tongue.

01:50.807 --> 01:53.453
You are coming to the Christmas
party, aren't you, Shirley?

01:53.453 --> 01:56.398
I wouldn't dream of missing it.

01:57.015 --> 01:57.829
What's that?

01:57.864 --> 01:59.751
Oh, that's just a case I'm assigning.

01:59.751 --> 02:02.320
Something senior partners
tend to do on occasion.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.315
This is one of Edwin Poole's cases.

02:04.315 --> 02:06.666
It seems to have slipped
through my crack.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.982
So I thought you'd find it
especially tasty.

02:08.982 --> 02:11.453
Ah. What kind of case?

02:11.488 --> 02:14.930
A woman is trying to get
custody of her sisters' twins.

02:14.930 --> 02:18.511
Evidently the little girls are
budding country music stars and

02:18.511 --> 02:22.022
the woman feels that this is
no way to raise children.

02:22.022 --> 02:25.680
You can't be serious. She's trying to
get custody because the girls sing?

02:25.680 --> 02:27.836
This sister seems is a bit protective.

02:27.836 --> 02:29.922
Anyway, we represent the mother and father.

02:29.922 --> 02:33.791
The trial starts tomorrow and
you need to meet the clients.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.525
What's my motivation?

02:36.088 --> 02:38.540
–I beg your pardon?
–My character's motivation?

02:38.540 --> 02:42.658
I can't just jump cold into
a case Shirley. I need incentive.

02:42.693 --> 02:44.408
Such as?

02:45.067 --> 02:46.798
Well…

02:46.833 --> 02:48.761
Let's say if I win,

02:48.796 --> 02:51.411
you have to dress up as a playboy
bunny for the Christmas party.

02:51.411 --> 02:53.060
Think of morale, Shirley.

02:53.060 --> 02:55.228
And if you lose, you dress up
as the bunny?

02:55.228 --> 02:56.206
Even better.

02:56.241 --> 02:57.185
Fine then.

02:57.186 --> 02:59.245
You have a bet.

03:04.057 --> 03:05.452
What am I missing?

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:37.920 --> 03:40.532
–How is everything, guys?
–Wonderful.

03:40.567 --> 03:44.305
Wonderful Sophia, I have
a feeling this was a happy cow.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.219
Mr Crane may I speak with you
for a minute?

03:47.219 --> 03:49.016
Absolutely, is it sexual?

03:49.051 --> 03:50.169
I need more butter.

03:50.169 --> 03:53.523
No it's a legal thing,
and it's personal.

03:53.987 --> 03:55.651
I'll get the butter.

03:55.849 --> 03:57.554
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

04:00.648 --> 04:02.944
It's about my daughter Claire.

04:02.979 --> 04:05.241
She's sixteen and I'm losing her.

04:05.276 --> 04:06.211
Drugs?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.134
No, she's got anorexia.

04:08.169 --> 04:10.604
We've been fighting
about it for months.

04:10.604 --> 04:13.059
She says nothing's wrong and
then she starts screaming at me

04:13.059 --> 04:15.030
and I start screaming back.

04:15.065 --> 04:18.983
Last week she moved out,
she's staying with her girlfriend

04:19.019 --> 04:21.634
and today I got served with this.

04:21.668 --> 04:23.733
Looks like a legal thing.
A document.

04:23.733 --> 04:25.979
She wants to be emancipated.

04:26.014 --> 04:28.190
I'm really scared, Mr Crane.

04:28.225 --> 04:32.351
Sophia, bring her into my office
and I'll talk some sense into her.

04:32.351 --> 04:35.473
Failing that, maybe a couple of cupcakes.

04:35.508 --> 04:36.995
What exactly are you gonna say?

04:36.995 --> 04:40.759
Well, I'll tell her, man needs to eat.

04:40.794 --> 04:42.284
Excuse me.

04:46.255 --> 04:47.663
It wasn't me.

04:48.938 --> 04:52.527
You must know that any judge is
going to laugh at a claim like this.

04:52.527 --> 04:54.778
Anabelle…

04:55.427 --> 04:57.485
what's really going on?

04:57.520 --> 04:59.171
I'm angry.

04:59.206 --> 05:01.746
My husband was not meant to die

05:01.781 --> 05:05.150
and I'm angry that people
just seem to flick it off like…

05:05.150 --> 05:07.273
What do you mean they flick it off?

05:07.273 --> 05:11.312
Like somehow because he got struck
by lightning, it was meant to be.

05:11.312 --> 05:14.814
You get cancer, you die
in a car crash, it's tragic.

05:14.849 --> 05:16.363
But a lightning bolt…

05:16.398 --> 05:21.407
his number was up, accept it.
Well, I can't accept it.

05:21.442 --> 05:23.752
And suing somebody,
maybe even God…

05:23.768 --> 05:27.923
I just want to give voice
to my rage. That's all.

05:28.156 --> 05:31.113
He was the only man I ever loved.

05:31.148 --> 05:34.070
How can God just take him away?

05:35.679 --> 05:37.478
Don't even think about it.

05:37.513 --> 05:40.385
I was talking to him when
it happened, you know.

05:40.385 --> 05:43.075
He was on the golf course.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.765
I called him on his cell.

05:45.800 --> 05:51.062
I heard the crack and he was gone.

05:52.136 --> 05:57.267
I'm sorry. I can't just
sit home and grieve.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.590
I just have to do something.

06:00.921 --> 06:02.693
–Mrs Carruthers.
–Denise…

06:02.728 --> 06:04.576
I'm going to take your case.

06:04.678 --> 06:06.855
They're beautiful, well behaved…

06:06.890 --> 06:09.068
We home school, on the road as well.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.441
My sister has issues.

06:10.441 --> 06:13.079
She's suing for custody
because of what they sing?

06:13.079 --> 06:17.943
Basically she thinks the songs and
our values are too conservative.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.314
Would you like to hear them
perform, Mr Shore?

06:20.314 --> 06:21.721
Delighted.

06:30.577 --> 06:35.046
♫ Rise up and shine, America's
sons and daughters, ♫

06:35.081 --> 06:39.385
♫ Rise up and shine, you've got
to fight to part those waters. ♫

06:39.420 --> 06:41.738
♫ When we swim in the light, ♫

06:41.773 --> 06:44.022
♫ all will be okay. ♫

06:44.057 --> 06:48.166
♫ The black, yellow and
brown man will wash away. ♫

06:48.201 --> 06:53.250
♫ Yes, the black, yellow and
brown man will wash away. ♫

06:53.285 --> 06:57.956
♫ Rise up and shine, America's
sons and daughters, ♫

06:57.991 --> 07:01.373
♫ Rise up and shine, you've got
to fight to part those waters. ♫

07:01.373 --> 07:04.686
♫ When we swim in the light
all will be okay. ♫

07:04.721 --> 07:07.219
–My sister thinks we're racist.
–Got it.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.948
♫ The black, yellow and
brown man will wash away. ♫

07:10.983 --> 07:16.549
♫ Yes, the black, yellow and
brown man will wash away. ♫

07:22.979 --> 07:24.191
Shirley.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.403
Yes, Alan.

07:25.938 --> 07:29.159
You didn't mention that the clients
were white supremacists.

07:29.159 --> 07:31.291
Didn't I? That doesn't
seem right. Does it?

07:31.291 --> 07:32.281
No, it doesn't, Shirley,

07:32.281 --> 07:35.512
and I've always considered you
such a beacon of fair play.

07:35.512 --> 07:36.889
Well, look on the bright side.

07:36.889 --> 07:40.750
You'll look great in that bunny outfit.
Think of morale, Alan.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.318
Motivated yet?

07:44.820 --> 07:48.669
Okay, you are all here
for the assistant position.

07:48.704 --> 07:50.825
I will be interviewing you one by one.

07:50.825 --> 07:53.052
Each of you will have
about three minutes.

07:53.052 --> 07:56.371
I do not care about your
dreams for world peace.

07:56.406 --> 07:59.997
You will not impress me
with your concerns for whales,

08:00.032 --> 08:02.900
AIDS babies, or greenhouse emissions.

08:02.935 --> 08:06.679
And if you're religious, for God's
sakes, keep it to yourself.

08:06.679 --> 08:09.386
All I want to know is
how fast you type,

08:09.421 --> 08:13.170
what's your experience,
level of education and—

08:13.406 --> 08:16.100
Clarice.

08:16.135 --> 08:17.772
Don't look at me like that.

08:17.772 --> 08:21.019
You're applying for the assistant position?

08:21.054 --> 08:23.854
I have skills.

08:23.889 --> 08:26.410
Okay, wig off.

08:26.445 --> 08:28.931
You first, Ho.

08:29.163 --> 08:32.431
Clarence, wig off!

08:39.476 --> 08:41.361
What's going on?

08:42.006 --> 08:44.129
I quit the other job.

08:44.164 --> 08:46.243
It wasn't the same
after they took me back.

08:46.243 --> 08:50.480
And what makes you think that
you could be a legal secretary?

08:50.515 --> 08:52.537
I went to law school.

08:52.572 --> 08:54.882
And Clarice has good people skills.

08:54.890 --> 08:56.547
You went to law school?

08:56.582 --> 08:58.849
I never practiced.

08:58.884 --> 09:01.887
But… but Clarice knows
everything I know and…

09:01.922 --> 09:04.744
Okay, I am not hiring Clarice.

09:04.779 --> 09:07.566
I don't even like Clarice.

09:07.601 --> 09:09.941
I will hire you…

09:09.976 --> 09:12.281
‥on a trial basis.

09:13.590 --> 09:15.795
I don't think I…

09:15.830 --> 09:18.621
It's too high pressure.
I have to be her.

09:18.656 --> 09:22.629
The offer is extended
to Clarence, not Clarice.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.795
I thought we were just gonna talk.

09:31.795 --> 09:34.769
We are, but since you got a lawyer,
I thought I should have one, too.

09:34.769 --> 09:36.759
–Shelley Ford.
–Denny Crane.

09:36.794 --> 09:39.426
Where did you come from,
and how is she paying you?

09:39.426 --> 09:40.814
We met on my web site.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.594
I'm a supporter of the pro-ana movement

09:42.594 --> 09:44.665
and an attorney with
Yannetti, Bauer & Lewis.

09:44.665 --> 09:46.072
I took this case pro bono.

09:46.072 --> 09:47.668
And what the hell is pro-ana?

09:47.668 --> 09:49.195
It's short of pro-anorexia.

09:49.195 --> 09:51.472
Now wait a minute.
You're in favor of a disease?

09:51.472 --> 09:54.630
Pro-ana is not a disease,
Mr Crane. It's a lifestyle choice.

09:54.630 --> 09:56.500
It's like being gay or an atheist.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.117
We're out of the closet.
We're not ashamed of it.

09:58.117 --> 10:01.215
We're tired of all the nasty labels.
And we're proud of the way we live.

10:01.215 --> 10:02.981
You're going to starve to death!

10:02.981 --> 10:04.919
I don't know how to be more clear.

10:04.919 --> 10:06.823
And once again, you heard nothing.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.807
Liver failure, muscle loss!

10:08.842 --> 10:10.772
–Stop it!
–You stopped your period a year ago.

10:10.772 --> 10:11.883
–Do you want to have children?
–Stop it!

10:11.883 --> 10:16.107
Mrs. Wilson, you indicated you
had something to say. What is it?

10:16.129 --> 10:17.972
You're too skinny.

10:18.007 --> 10:19.780
Snap out of it.

10:19.815 --> 10:21.555
I guess we'll see
each other in court.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.247
Not if you turn sideways.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.098
What?

10:28.930 --> 10:30.078
You did what?

10:30.113 --> 10:32.095
If we can just get past
summary judgment…

10:32.095 --> 10:34.637
You won't get past it.
Suing God?

10:34.672 --> 10:36.925
Have you lost your mind?
And you…

10:36.960 --> 10:39.213
I told you to prevent this
from happening.

10:39.213 --> 10:41.121
–I tried.
–You tried!

10:41.156 --> 10:42.284
What's up?

10:43.590 --> 10:47.484
Brad and Denise have decided
to represent a woman suing God.

10:47.484 --> 10:48.914
I didn't decide. She…

10:48.949 --> 10:51.355
You both bear responsibility
for taking this case.

10:51.355 --> 10:54.095
You both will figure out a way
to beat summary judgment.

10:54.095 --> 10:56.002
That shouldn't be too hard.

10:58.270 --> 11:01.188
Do you know the facts
of this case, Mr Coho?

11:01.223 --> 11:04.721
No, but anybody can get a case
past summary judgment.

11:05.158 --> 11:06.394
Maybe not.

11:06.429 --> 11:09.794
Okay. All three of you
will bear responsibility.

11:09.829 --> 11:11.244
–Whoa, whoa, no.
–No, no!

11:11.244 --> 11:12.590
You just got yourself assigned.

11:12.590 --> 11:16.880
You can take this opportunity to
further your bond with Mr Chase.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.379
I was raised the same
way they were.

11:25.379 --> 11:27.624
Our parents told us
the same stories.

11:27.624 --> 11:29.825
About there being no holocaust,

11:29.860 --> 11:33.879
the blacks mongrelizing the
pure white race, the whole deal.

11:33.914 --> 11:35.826
But I was able to come out from under it.

11:35.826 --> 11:38.505
And now you're trying to put
your stamp on our children.

11:38.505 --> 11:43.393
Ms Shaw, Ms Monroe, regardless of
my personal feelings about this case,

11:43.428 --> 11:44.962
I can assure you of one thing,

11:44.962 --> 11:47.839
you have no legal standing
to challenge custody here.

11:47.839 --> 11:50.872
The court wouldn't dare take
children away from their parents

11:50.872 --> 11:53.245
because of said parents'
political beliefs.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.474
Mr and Mrs Tanner
are extremists,

11:55.509 --> 11:59.652
and they are hazardous to their own
children's welfare as well as society.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.109
And we are prepared to prove

12:01.109 --> 12:05.267
that this custody battle is not
only a matter of child welfare,

12:05.281 --> 12:08.182
but of national security.

12:08.464 --> 12:10.967
She actually cited national security

12:11.002 --> 12:13.836
as grounds for taking children
away from their parents.

12:13.836 --> 12:15.543
White supremacists are hate cells.

12:15.543 --> 12:18.560
Hate cells are a breeding
ground for terror. It's a fact.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.508
If seeing Shirley in pink ears
weren't incentive enough,

12:21.508 --> 12:25.534
I think I actually might have
to fight this one on principle.

12:26.627 --> 12:31.101
So basically, we've both got mothers
trying to hang on to their daughters.

12:31.101 --> 12:35.030
Maybe we should critique
each other's closings.

12:40.296 --> 12:41.944
What?

12:41.979 --> 12:44.869
You… you don't think I can do this?

12:45.706 --> 12:47.555
I most certainly didn't say that.

12:47.555 --> 12:49.565
Oh, yes, you did.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.722
You don't trust me.

12:51.757 --> 12:53.936
–Denny…
–I know you too well, Alan.

12:53.936 --> 12:56.045
You don't think I can handle this solo.

12:56.045 --> 12:59.286
I'm simply saying, given
the enormity of the stakes,

12:59.286 --> 13:02.919
it can't hurt for either
of us to get feedback.

13:04.906 --> 13:06.579
Right.

13:08.878 --> 13:13.435
I'm getting sick of having
to prove myself to you.

13:39.374 --> 13:44.554
Clarence, one of your duties
would be to pick up the phone

13:44.589 --> 13:47.907
when it makes noises like that.

13:48.426 --> 13:49.945
I… I can't.

13:49.980 --> 13:53.017
Can you at least let me
be her on the phone?

13:55.735 --> 13:56.865
Okay.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.875
I will let you be her on the
phone at the beginning,

13:59.875 --> 14:02.303
but you will not be
calling our clients “Hos”.

14:02.303 --> 14:05.450
And after a month, you will
have to be you all the time,

14:05.450 --> 14:07.301
including when you are on the phone.

14:07.301 --> 14:08.618
Thank you.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.237
Claire Sim's office.

14:13.272 --> 14:15.630
This is Clarice Bell speakin'.

14:15.665 --> 14:18.320
Yes, yes, indeed.

14:18.355 --> 14:21.245
This summer we sang at a Patriot's
day picnic in Richmond

14:21.245 --> 14:23.539
and at the solstice festival in Tampa.

14:23.539 --> 14:27.006
Also, we got to do the national anthem
at an anti-immigration rally in Ft. Payne.

14:27.006 --> 14:29.008
Katey, do you ever wish that,

14:29.043 --> 14:32.993
instead of having to perform
at those kinds of gatherings,

14:33.028 --> 14:38.323
that you could do fun things like other
kids… summer camp, Disneyland?

14:38.358 --> 14:41.399
Performing is fun for us,
and it's important.

14:41.434 --> 14:42.927
We're standing up for something.

14:42.927 --> 14:46.111
And what exactly are
you standing up for?

14:46.146 --> 14:47.436
White pride.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.399
I mean, other groups are allowed
to be proud of themselves, right?

14:50.399 --> 14:54.075
Objection. Katey, sweetheart,
you weren't asked a question.

14:54.075 --> 14:56.982
I'd like to hear from Katey.

14:57.204 --> 15:01.258
It used to just be, like, blacks with their
marches and history month and stuff.

15:01.258 --> 15:03.702
Now it's everyone, like the Mexicans.

15:03.737 --> 15:07.099
They illegally cross our borders, then
say they want to become Americans.

15:07.099 --> 15:10.517
But at their rallies, they just wave
their Mexican flags and talk Spanish.

15:10.517 --> 15:13.900
With our songs, we're saying that
whites need to stand up and fight back,

15:13.900 --> 15:16.496
because the minorities, they're winning.

15:16.496 --> 15:17.853
Winning what?

15:17.888 --> 15:19.175
The race war.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.647
Not, like with gun, with babies.

15:21.682 --> 15:23.280
The Mexicans, the Chinese,

15:23.280 --> 15:26.562
they're all having as many kids
as they can so they can take over.

15:26.562 --> 15:29.810
Whites are already a minority in
California, Texas and New Mexico.

15:29.810 --> 15:31.925
We've pretty much lost
those states already.

15:31.925 --> 15:33.532
And who told you that?

15:33.567 --> 15:35.140
I learned it in school.

15:35.175 --> 15:36.717
Your home school?

15:36.752 --> 15:39.861
The one that your mother teaches?

15:39.896 --> 15:41.394
Yes.

15:41.676 --> 15:43.981
Katey, have your parents
ever hit you?

15:43.981 --> 15:45.375
Hit me? No.

15:45.410 --> 15:46.532
How about Lauren?

15:46.538 --> 15:49.063
To your knowledge, have they
ever been violent with her?

15:49.063 --> 15:50.530
No, they love us.

15:50.565 --> 15:53.203
Do the two of you always
get enough to eat?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.284
Um, yeah.

15:54.319 --> 15:55.615
How about your health?

15:55.615 --> 15:58.472
Any aches or pains
not being attended to,

15:58.507 --> 16:01.365
perhaps a sore throat
from all that singing?

16:01.365 --> 16:02.099
No.

16:02.134 --> 16:03.703
Okay. Now, Katey,

16:03.738 --> 16:07.218
Ms Monroe mentioned that
your mother is your teacher.

16:07.218 --> 16:10.629
Given all that time you spend
traveling and performing,

16:10.629 --> 16:13.696
does she ever let you slide
a little when it comes to school?

16:13.696 --> 16:16.086
I wish. We do way more homework

16:16.121 --> 16:18.756
and get better test scores
than kids in regular schools.

16:18.756 --> 16:20.707
And whenever we take a trip somewhere,

16:20.707 --> 16:24.264
our dad always turns it
into a total history lesson.

16:24.299 --> 16:26.081
I can imagine.

16:26.358 --> 16:33.102
So, you're safe and well fed,
healthy and successful.

16:33.137 --> 16:35.121
Let me ask you.

16:35.156 --> 16:38.119
As long as you and your
sister could be together,

16:38.119 --> 16:41.134
and if it were up to you, with
whom would you want to live?

16:41.134 --> 16:44.088
We want to live at home
with our family.

16:45.436 --> 16:46.539
Sue the Church?

16:46.574 --> 16:48.806
Why not? A lightning bolt
is an act of God.

16:48.806 --> 16:51.003
The church holds itself out
as an agent of God.

16:51.003 --> 16:52.470
Let's slap the Episcopalians.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.065
It's ridiculous.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.298
You got a better idea?

16:55.298 --> 16:57.162
You're the one that's supposed
to have the better ideas,

16:57.162 --> 16:58.991
because you said we could
beat this in summary judgment.

16:58.991 --> 17:00.484
Okay, here's an idea.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.548
Why don't we tell the judge
to kiss my ass?

17:02.548 --> 17:05.032
That can work pretty nicely
if you say it just right.

17:05.032 --> 17:06.858
Let me practice.

17:06.894 --> 17:10.231
Kiss my ass.
What do you think?

17:11.189 --> 17:13.178
No, no! No, no, no. no!

17:13.213 --> 17:15.167
Uh-huh. That's enough.

17:18.609 --> 17:21.028
I don't do drugs, and I don't drink.

17:21.063 --> 17:24.186
I take AP classes, and
I get all straight A's.

17:24.222 --> 17:25.717
And you're graduating early?

17:25.717 --> 17:26.917
With honors.

17:26.953 --> 17:29.287
You also have a web site, don't you?

17:29.287 --> 17:30.811
It's called Thinspire.

17:30.846 --> 17:33.777
It's a support community for
goal-oriented young women.

17:33.777 --> 17:38.989
We post articles and suggestions on
how to live a more thinspirational life.

17:39.024 --> 17:41.500
And how do you plan to
support yourself financially?

17:41.500 --> 17:42.584
I model.

17:42.619 --> 17:44.674
Well, I'm just getting started, really.

17:44.674 --> 17:47.541
I've done fashion shows for
a few local department stores,

17:47.541 --> 17:50.724
but recently I've gotten
a lot of catalog work.

17:50.759 --> 17:53.942
It's pretty steady, and
I make about $125 an hour.

17:53.942 --> 17:57.098
It sounds to me like you're doing
pretty well for yourself, Ms Wilson.

17:57.098 --> 17:59.644
Yes, I am.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.763
What did you have
for breakfast this morning?

18:01.763 --> 18:06.588
I had a diet soda and a cracker
with some butter spray on it.

18:06.623 --> 18:07.539
And lunch?

18:07.574 --> 18:08.614
I didn't eat lunch.

18:08.614 --> 18:10.535
I can't eat when I'm stressed out.

18:10.535 --> 18:14.148
So, how many calories
have you had today?

18:14.183 --> 18:15.080
Sixteen.

18:15.115 --> 18:18.594
Are you aware that the daily
required number of calories

18:18.594 --> 18:22.687
for someone of your age and height
is somewhere between 1,800 and 2,400?

18:22.687 --> 18:26.374
And are you aware that two out of
three Americans are overweight?

18:26.374 --> 18:27.980
No one's calling them sick.

18:27.980 --> 18:30.625
I'm healthy. I watch what
I eat and I exercise.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.775
You can ask any fat girl at my school
if she'd want to trade places with me.

18:33.775 --> 18:35.553
Now don't go knocking fat girls.

18:35.553 --> 18:37.885
I love chubby sex and
I'm sure your honor does.

18:37.885 --> 18:39.798
Mr Crane!

18:41.398 --> 18:42.537
Ms Wilson,

18:42.572 --> 18:47.655
are you aware that the “Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders”

18:47.655 --> 18:51.733
defines anorexia nervosa
as a mental illness?

18:51.768 --> 18:55.404
Thirty years ago they said the
same thing about homosexuality.

18:55.404 --> 18:57.251
Exactly!

18:57.286 --> 18:59.198
No further questions.

19:03.719 --> 19:04.737
I don't understand.

19:04.737 --> 19:08.306
Why does he need to hear closing
statements? It's a simple decision.

19:08.306 --> 19:09.921
What is wrong with this judge?

19:09.921 --> 19:15.048
Well, maybe he's just prejudiced
against, you know, skinheads.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.690
Do I look like a skinhead,
Mr Shore?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.890
I'm told they can take on
various forms.

19:19.890 --> 19:21.913
Hey, if you're prejudiced
against us—

19:21.913 --> 19:25.048
♫ Rise up and shine, America's
sons and daughters. ♫

19:25.048 --> 19:26.349
Quiet!

19:26.849 --> 19:30.283
Listen, as much as I enjoy
the company of you, show people,

19:30.283 --> 19:31.947
I have a closing to prepare, so

19:31.947 --> 19:36.424
I'll see you and your full heads
of hair at the courthouse.

19:36.459 --> 19:39.369
We are not bigoted.
Our message is simply…

19:39.404 --> 19:43.034
It's good to be white.
I'll meet you at the courthouse.

19:49.562 --> 19:51.274
Case going well?

19:51.309 --> 19:52.854
It isn't over yet, Shirley.

19:52.854 --> 19:56.209
We haven't even gotten to the part
where I deliver my politically biased

19:56.209 --> 19:58.862
but compelling closing argument.

20:04.279 --> 20:07.785
Now, how cute is that?

20:15.414 --> 20:17.120
We've heard testimony
from your daughter

20:17.120 --> 20:19.760
that at her new, lower weight,
her social life's improved.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.330
–She's being asked out on dates.
–That's true, but—

20:22.330 --> 20:25.676
She's getting more involved in school
activities now that her self-esteem is up.

20:25.676 --> 20:27.789
We've heard she loves theater and dance.

20:27.789 --> 20:30.326
At her previous weight, she
was getting supporting roles,

20:30.326 --> 20:32.793
and now she's got the lead
in “Grease”, correct?
–Yes.

20:32.793 --> 20:35.474
Wouldn't you say, your daughter
is blossoming at her new weight?

20:35.474 --> 20:36.556
But that's not the point.

20:36.556 --> 20:38.945
So because Claire has chosen
a pro-ana lifestyle,

20:38.945 --> 20:40.474
her life has improved.

20:40.509 --> 20:42.395
She's now working professionally.

20:42.395 --> 20:45.763
She's completely capable of living on her
own and this is a threat to you, isn't it?

20:45.763 --> 20:46.772
No, that's not it at all.

20:46.772 --> 20:48.969
And under your care, you'd
want her to gain weight,

20:48.969 --> 20:51.570
which would make her lose her
self-esteem, her career would suffer,

20:51.570 --> 20:53.780
but you'd still have control
over your little girl's life.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.271
Objection! She's being, uh…

20:56.306 --> 20:57.504
objectionable.

20:57.539 --> 20:58.667
Sustained.

20:58.702 --> 21:03.046
I have my daughter's
best interests at heart.

21:03.081 --> 21:05.738
You're a forty year old single mother
working in a steakhouse.

21:05.738 --> 21:08.360
The only good thing that you have
going for you is your daughter.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.033
You want to hang on to her
as long as you possibly can…

21:11.033 --> 21:13.969
–Objection!
–‥so you don't have to examine
your own empty life.

21:13.969 --> 21:17.926
–Your honor!
–Ms Ford, that's enough.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.124
Ms Sims?

21:36.137 --> 21:38.550
You can call me Claire.

21:38.908 --> 21:44.567
Claire, uh, the, uh, the case that
Mr Coho and Mr Chase are working on…

21:45.405 --> 21:49.492
I, uh… I pulled up some research.

21:52.404 --> 21:53.394
The cell phone?

21:53.414 --> 21:56.731
Evidently, he was talking on it when
he got struck by the lightning?

21:56.731 --> 22:00.175
Those studies linking cell phones and
lightning have been completely debunked.

22:00.175 --> 22:01.944
Well…

22:04.386 --> 22:07.409
Go ahead, Clarence.

22:09.270 --> 22:11.222
Clarence.

22:12.315 --> 22:16.357
The… The studies have been, uh,
mainly discounted, but not totally.

22:16.357 --> 22:20.365
And conflicting studies… it…
becomes a question of fact, not law.

22:20.365 --> 22:24.406
Which means the case can't get
kicked at summary judgment.

22:24.859 --> 22:27.205
Can I see those studies, please?

22:30.555 --> 22:32.948
Interesting, I could run with this.

22:33.273 --> 22:34.830
I'll run with it.

22:34.865 --> 22:36.320
Guys…

22:42.367 --> 22:45.666
How are they supposed to seriously
function in this world as adults

22:45.666 --> 22:48.285
if they've been brought up
as white supremacists?

22:48.285 --> 22:49.780
Many seem to do just fine.

22:49.780 --> 22:54.795
Your honor, is this an environment
that you would subject your children to?

22:54.830 --> 22:57.862
And this is a physical danger as well.

22:57.897 --> 23:00.940
White supremacists are more likely
to become involved in violence.

23:00.940 --> 23:02.714
They're hate groups,

23:02.749 --> 23:06.705
Mr Shore can deride me for pulling
the national security card,

23:06.705 --> 23:10.840
but do not tell me that the
Timothy McVeighs of this world

23:10.875 --> 23:13.881
and the Christian Identity
Organization and the like,

23:13.881 --> 23:16.622
which support violence
and are antigovernment,

23:16.622 --> 23:20.366
you can't tell me that they don't
pose a threat to this country.

23:20.366 --> 23:26.972
For God's sake, these two little girls are
being taught to adhere to a whites-only,

23:27.007 --> 23:30.998
immigrant-bashing, Jew-hating ideology.

23:31.033 --> 23:32.888
You heard them.

23:32.923 --> 23:38.723
And their performances are
being used to recruit other people
to join in with the prejudice.

23:38.723 --> 23:43.786
How can this court not
step in and rescue them?

23:49.544 --> 23:52.776
Benjamin Franklin is often
attributed with the quote,

23:52.776 --> 23:54.761
“Those who would give up
essential liberty

23:54.761 --> 23:58.321
to purchase a little temporary
safety deserve neither.”

23:58.321 --> 24:01.263
And he certainly knew
what he was talking about.

24:01.263 --> 24:04.170
He ate lots of red meat
and invented the swim fin.

24:04.170 --> 24:07.785
When our current president, who,
by the way, has invented nothing,

24:07.785 --> 24:10.505
signed the Patriot Act into law in 2001,

24:10.540 --> 24:12.934
not a single member of
congress could be found

24:12.934 --> 24:15.258
who had read the bill
all the way through.

24:15.258 --> 24:17.704
And yet, they couldn't wait
to hand over our rights.

24:17.704 --> 24:19.709
“Al Queda's coming.
Where's my pen?”

24:19.709 --> 24:21.475
Anything to feel safe.

24:21.510 --> 24:24.444
Like a parent who dangles
car keys to distract a child,

24:24.444 --> 24:28.543
our government whips out national
security to grab our attention

24:28.543 --> 24:30.049
whenever they deem it necessary.

24:30.049 --> 24:32.446
And that's what opposing
council is doing here.

24:32.446 --> 24:34.809
But this case is not
about national security.

24:34.809 --> 24:36.129
It's about a family.

24:36.137 --> 24:40.789
Granted, a family that is
so filled with spite

24:40.824 --> 24:46.022
and ignorance and shockingly
untutored ideas that it beggars
the imagination,

24:46.057 --> 24:48.456
but still a family.

24:48.491 --> 24:53.511
And as long as Lauren and Katey
are well fed and well cared for,

24:53.546 --> 24:58.101
a family the law cannot
and should not touch.

24:58.756 --> 25:02.982
Now I think we would all agree

25:03.017 --> 25:09.100
that we'd prefer these children
to be raised in a different way.

25:09.324 --> 25:12.309
Certainly Mrs Tanner's
sister thinks so.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.294
But she knows legally
that is not possible,

25:15.329 --> 25:16.577
so she and her lawyer are

25:16.577 --> 25:22.329
wheeling out our latest favorite
rights-squashing mechanism,
national security.

25:22.364 --> 25:24.337
And who can blame them?
It's all the rage.

25:24.337 --> 25:26.240
If you want to look at
people's bank records,

25:26.240 --> 25:30.201
tap their phones, read their
e-mails, go ahead, do it.

25:30.236 --> 25:32.487
Just say it's a matter of national security.

25:32.487 --> 25:35.885
And now we're claiming the
Tanner family is a threat.

25:35.885 --> 25:41.125
If that is the case, if there is any
actual evidence linking them to a crime,

25:41.160 --> 25:43.937
by all means, be my guest,
please, have at 'em, arrest them.

25:43.937 --> 25:48.086
But if there is no cause
to arrest them,

25:49.253 --> 25:53.638
then leave this family alone.

26:10.928 --> 26:12.356
Where's my mom?
Is she all right?

26:12.356 --> 26:14.536
She's in here, still alive.

26:18.949 --> 26:21.483
–You lied to me.
–No, I didn't.

26:21.877 --> 26:25.016
I told you your mom was in the hospital,
and you had to get down here immediately,

26:25.016 --> 26:27.272
and she is still alive.

26:28.003 --> 26:32.709
Only this young woman unfortunately,
is not doing quite so well.

26:40.164 --> 26:43.367
Ms Murr, Claire Wilson.

26:45.687 --> 26:51.066
My daughter Cathy has complications
due to anorexia nervosa.

27:01.570 --> 27:02.707
Claire.

27:02.742 --> 27:06.889
You really thought that that
after school special “O.C.” crap
was going to work on me?

27:06.889 --> 27:09.211
–Cookie?
–That girl has what you have.

27:09.211 --> 27:10.743
No, she doesn't.

27:10.778 --> 27:13.826
A true pro-ana wouldn't fail like that.
–Are you serious?

27:13.826 --> 27:16.320
–Chips?
–Stop offering me food.

27:16.355 --> 27:18.779
What the hell is going on here?

27:18.814 --> 27:22.529
My mother and Mr Crane
are trying to scare me by
showing me a girl who's dying.

27:22.529 --> 27:24.337
You're going to die, Claire.

27:24.337 --> 27:26.253
Can't you get that?
You're going to die.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.091
You had the nerve to call
my client down here

27:28.091 --> 27:29.933
and show her that
without my knowledge?

27:29.933 --> 27:31.196
This is outrageous.

27:31.231 --> 27:33.585
I'll notify the court.
I'll notify the Bar.

27:33.585 --> 27:36.957
Congratulations, you've
just lost your daughter.

27:47.249 --> 27:48.663
Oh, Alan.

27:48.951 --> 27:51.282
Sophia, hello.

27:53.494 --> 27:54.624
Come in.

27:54.659 --> 27:57.275
Can I ask you, um…

27:57.534 --> 27:59.477
Is Denny Crane any good?

27:59.512 --> 28:01.386
Why do you ask me that?

28:01.421 --> 28:04.043
Well, he's been a bit
of a clown in court,

28:04.043 --> 28:08.421
and he orchestrated this
ridiculous stunt at a hospital.

28:08.456 --> 28:11.548
And I'm gonna…

28:11.583 --> 28:13.973
I am gonna lose my daughter.

28:14.008 --> 28:17.222
Is there any way
you could take over?

28:17.257 --> 28:19.330
Ooh, that would be…

28:19.365 --> 28:22.501
I'm not sure Denny Crane
knows what he's doing.

28:23.867 --> 28:26.731
Sophia, what's going on?

28:26.766 --> 28:29.167
Sophia and I were just
discussing the case, Denny.

28:29.167 --> 28:33.001
She mentioned your creative stunt
at the hospital this morning.

28:33.001 --> 28:34.114
Brilliant.

28:34.149 --> 28:37.691
I just finished my closing.
Would you like to read it?

28:37.691 --> 28:38.879
Sure.

28:38.914 --> 28:40.397
My office.

28:45.356 --> 28:46.756
I'm gonna have to hire
somebody else.

28:46.756 --> 28:50.122
Don't do anything yet, Sophia.
Let me work on this.

29:00.457 --> 29:05.892
This is a situation that touches two
deep emotional chords in all of us.

29:05.927 --> 29:08.556
The sanctity of the family
on the one hand,

29:08.556 --> 29:12.704
the distaste we feel for
hatemongering on the other.

29:12.739 --> 29:14.339
But the law is clear.

29:14.374 --> 29:17.857
Mr and Mrs Tanner may be
questionable as human beings

29:17.857 --> 29:21.205
but they are loving parents.

29:21.240 --> 29:25.392
The petitioner's motion
for removal is denied.

29:35.427 --> 29:40.552
♫ Michael, row the boat
ashore, hallelujah. ♫

29:40.587 --> 29:41.650
♫ Michael, row… ♫

29:41.650 --> 29:45.706
Michael was a gay Jew from Mexico.
You know that, of course.

29:45.741 --> 29:47.214
Let's go, girls.

29:55.583 --> 29:57.668
Just let me lead, and
then you follow.

29:57.668 --> 29:59.719
I'll lead. It's my case. I took it.

29:59.719 --> 30:00.587
She took it.

30:00.622 --> 30:02.105
Under my supervision as partner.

30:02.105 --> 30:04.425
Guys, you're both partners. I'm not.

30:04.425 --> 30:06.293
So why am I the only one
acting like an adult?

30:06.293 --> 30:08.039
Okay, let me just say something
before we go in here.

30:08.039 --> 30:10.115
I have tried to have patience with him,

30:10.115 --> 30:11.696
but I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle.

30:11.696 --> 30:13.532
You ever win any battles, Brad?

30:13.532 --> 30:15.089
Okay, let's go in.

30:16.155 --> 30:18.350
Good morning, thank you
for agreeing to see us.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.510
I am Denise Bauer.
This is Brad Chase and…

30:20.510 --> 30:21.384
I'm Jeffrey Coho.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.443
I know how busy you are, so
I thought we'd cut right to it.

30:23.443 --> 30:26.744
We represent a woman by the name
of Annabelle Caruthers whose husband
was regrettably killed

30:26.744 --> 30:28.907
after being struck by lightning
while talking on a cell phone

30:28.907 --> 30:31.246
manufactured by your client
Cybus Technologies.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.156
Yes.

30:32.191 --> 30:34.875
Why don't you cut right to the part
where we should be held liable?

30:34.875 --> 30:36.614
–Certainly—
–You see, when lightning strikes,

30:36.614 --> 30:39.069
the human skin offers some
protection, significant, in fact.

30:39.069 --> 30:42.617
What happens is electricity is conducted
over the skin rather than through the body.

30:42.617 --> 30:44.229
It's a phenomenon know as flashover.

30:44.229 --> 30:46.548
Conductive material in
direct contact with the skin,

30:46.548 --> 30:48.832
especially something metallic
such as a mobile phone,

30:48.832 --> 30:50.388
can negate the flashover effect,

30:50.388 --> 30:52.875
cause the voltage to go
right through the body.

30:52.875 --> 30:55.077
We've brought three studies
that speak to liability.

30:55.077 --> 30:57.769
As for the issue of foresee-ability,
there have been other cases.

30:57.769 --> 30:59.885
In Australia, they now issue warnings.

30:59.885 --> 31:01.614
England is considering doing so.

31:01.614 --> 31:05.474
The fact is using a cell phone in a
thunderstorm is potentially lethal.

31:05.474 --> 31:07.631
And can result in death.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.586
It resulted in the death
of our client's husband.

31:09.586 --> 31:11.259
Look, you're gonna have
your experts. We'll have ours.

31:11.259 --> 31:13.487
But in the meantime, the cost
of negative publicity alone…

31:13.487 --> 31:16.287
Not to mention, of the billions
of dollars generated from
cell phone usage,

31:16.287 --> 31:19.743
hundreds of millions come
from people talking on the outside
in inclement weather.

31:19.743 --> 31:24.693
You don't want people putting
their cell phones away
during storms, do you?

32:02.506 --> 32:05.608
You should both be
embarrassed, for God's sake.

32:06.359 --> 32:09.170
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

32:09.205 --> 32:11.057
–I won.
–You did not.

32:11.092 --> 32:12.910
Oh, shut up, both of you!

32:12.945 --> 32:13.881
God!

32:13.916 --> 32:16.190
Obviously I have to keep you apart,

32:16.190 --> 32:20.373
since you lack the maturity to conduct yourselves as adults.

32:21.961 --> 32:23.444
We got an offer.

32:23.479 --> 32:24.758
What do you mean, you got an offer?

32:24.758 --> 32:28.899
$75,000. Its not a lot, but as far as a lightning-bolt case goes…

32:28.899 --> 32:30.371
–Told you I'd get something.
–I got it.

32:30.371 --> 32:31.680
Shut up!

32:42.627 --> 32:43.572
Who's this?

32:43.607 --> 32:47.799
I'm Alan Shore. Mr Crane was unexpectedly called to court.

32:47.834 --> 32:51.410
I'm filling in. I'll make this very brief.

32:51.445 --> 32:52.397
What's this?

32:52.432 --> 32:54.342
This would be an arrest warrant.

32:54.342 --> 32:55.389
Don't be concerned.

32:55.389 --> 32:57.808
They won't execute it unless I give them the word.

32:57.808 --> 32:59.374
An arrest warrant for whom?

32:59.374 --> 33:00.519
You.

33:00.554 --> 33:01.348
Me?

33:01.383 --> 33:02.800
Yes, Ms Wilson.

33:02.801 --> 33:06.459
It turns out your web site gives other teenagers' advice on

33:06.459 --> 33:10.082
how to acquire diet pills with or without a prescription.

33:10.082 --> 33:11.168
That's not against the law.

33:11.168 --> 33:13.962
It is if she is contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

33:13.962 --> 33:15.776
You've got all kinds of little tips in there

33:15.776 --> 33:19.141
that could expose you to both criminal and civil liability.

33:19.141 --> 33:21.305
What's going on? I could actually be arrested?

33:21.305 --> 33:23.910
I can make this go away. Do not worry.

33:23.945 --> 33:26.392
Yes, you can certainly have your day in court,

33:26.392 --> 33:29.432
possibly prevail, though I doubt it.

33:29.467 --> 33:30.824
And in the meantime,

33:30.859 --> 33:34.294
word of your arrest will undoubtedly make it to the modeling agencies,

33:34.294 --> 33:37.281
and there goes your livelihood. A scandalous scandal.

33:37.281 --> 33:39.139
And then the civil lawsuits can begin.

33:39.139 --> 33:42.961
Will you be representing her for free in those, Ms Ford?

33:46.208 --> 33:49.896
My suggestion would be to go to rehab and get the help you need. But

33:49.896 --> 33:51.833
I suppose you could go to jail

33:51.833 --> 33:57.170
and add two new photos to your portfolio, front and side.

33:58.548 --> 34:00.748
This is so pathetically desperate.

34:00.748 --> 34:02.913
Well, finally we agree on something.

34:02.913 --> 34:05.181
I'm desperate.

34:07.737 --> 34:10.652
How about the lawyer's leave?

34:10.688 --> 34:14.969
And you can have a conversation with your mother.

35:37.821 --> 35:41.058
This isn't exactly the image I had in my mind,

35:41.093 --> 35:43.044
but I'm still aroused.

35:43.079 --> 35:44.961
I'm glad to hear it.

35:44.996 --> 35:47.117
Maybe I could throw my costume on,

35:47.117 --> 35:49.555
and we could go do what rabbits like to do best.

35:49.555 --> 35:51.060
Don't make me hit you.

35:51.095 --> 35:52.163
Hit me?

35:52.164 --> 35:55.566
You wouldn't be standing under mistletoe unless you wanted to kiss me.

35:55.566 --> 35:57.106
I'm not standing under…

35:57.141 --> 35:58.511
Hey!

36:00.995 --> 36:02.383
Hey!

36:07.898 --> 36:12.254
Okay! The slobber you just got came from his mouth.

36:12.486 --> 36:14.411
Quite the party, I see.

36:14.446 --> 36:15.799
I assume I was invited.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.084
It goes without saying.

36:17.084 --> 36:19.090
Which is why it did.

36:19.125 --> 36:20.249
Dance, Denny?

36:20.284 --> 36:22.858
She made it sound like I have a choice.

36:25.065 --> 36:26.907
That leaves you and me.

36:26.942 --> 36:28.196
And him.

36:29.740 --> 36:33.300
–Jerry?
–Merry Christmas, my friend.

36:34.476 --> 36:35.862
Thank you.

36:35.897 --> 36:38.070
–Open it.
–Okay.

36:39.052 --> 36:40.366
I paint.

36:40.401 --> 36:43.528
One of my hobbies is to supplant the faces of people

36:43.528 --> 36:46.621
I care about on famous personalities that match up well.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.294
I see.

36:50.765 --> 36:53.738
Oh. Jerry…

36:53.773 --> 36:56.712
It's amazing.

36:58.354 --> 36:59.357
Wow.

36:59.392 --> 37:00.357
Do you like it?

37:00.357 --> 37:02.251
I love it.

37:23.285 --> 37:25.303
I guess we should work this out.

37:25.303 --> 37:26.915
Does it have to be tonight?

37:26.915 --> 37:28.433
Well, it is the season.

37:28.458 --> 37:30.847
Peace on Earth, good will toward men.

37:30.847 --> 37:32.289
What was that?

37:32.532 --> 37:33.824
Good will toward men?

37:33.824 --> 37:35.048
No right before that.

37:35.048 --> 37:36.758
Peace on Earth?

37:37.085 --> 37:38.649
I knew it.

37:39.195 --> 37:40.872
A liberal.

37:54.747 --> 37:57.551
Aren't you coming out to join the party?

37:57.824 --> 37:59.323
Maybe in a minute.

37:59.358 --> 38:03.844
Well, I have somebody who wants to say hello to you.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.746
I just want to thank you.

38:06.781 --> 38:11.503
I was told you were the one who came up with the idea to sue the phone company.

38:11.503 --> 38:15.700
And $75,000, that's a lot of money to me.

38:15.735 --> 38:18.421
And, um, I just want to thank you.

38:18.456 --> 38:19.853
Okay.

38:21.652 --> 38:23.293
He's cute.

38:23.786 --> 38:25.419
Yes, he is.

38:29.559 --> 38:31.234
You pass the BAR, Clarence?

38:31.234 --> 38:33.860
Yes, but I could never practice.

38:33.895 --> 38:34.847
Why not?

38:34.882 --> 38:36.898
I… I could never.

38:39.045 --> 38:41.223
I think we're gonna work on that.

39:09.547 --> 39:10.668
Handicapped.

39:10.703 --> 39:12.974
–Excuse me.
–Coming through.

39:13.009 --> 39:14.431
Out of my way!

39:14.466 --> 39:15.853
Handicapped.

39:44.963 --> 39:46.794
We had our first three-way tonight.

39:46.794 --> 39:50.906
I'm not sure that Shirley enjoyed it as much as we did.

39:53.114 --> 39:55.238
It was fabulous for me.

39:57.580 --> 40:00.342
She didn't quite taste the same as I remember.

40:00.342 --> 40:02.676
She tasted more like…

40:02.711 --> 40:05.749
Me. That was my slobber, Denny.

40:05.784 --> 40:08.787
We finally exchanged bodily fluids.

40:14.673 --> 40:17.096
Did I tell you my case worked out?

40:17.421 --> 40:20.885
Sophia's daughter decided to come home after all.

40:21.178 --> 40:22.243
Fantastic.

40:22.278 --> 40:26.496
Got a call from the clerk's office to come to court for the summations.

40:26.496 --> 40:28.608
Turns out it was a mistake.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.755
And, uh, by the time I got back,

40:30.764 --> 40:33.021
Sophia was on the phone with the good news.

40:33.021 --> 40:35.942
Well, you must've somehow reached the girl, Denny.

40:35.942 --> 40:37.808
Congratulations.

40:38.357 --> 40:41.284
Of course, the warrant didn't hurt.

40:44.370 --> 40:46.978
I may miss a lot, Alan,

40:47.013 --> 40:50.211
but I don't miss everything.

40:53.603 --> 40:56.096
I just…

40:56.419 --> 40:59.098
came up with the idea

40:59.133 --> 41:02.253
and I thought you'd object to any kind of assistance.

41:02.253 --> 41:05.399
So you decided to keep the truth from me?

41:07.025 --> 41:09.484
Sophia came to you.

41:10.042 --> 41:12.905
She didn't trust that I was winning.

41:14.882 --> 41:17.490
But I was, Alan.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.515
I believe you.

41:20.550 --> 41:22.249
I'm not sure you do.

41:22.284 --> 41:26.881
But I know your heart's in the right place.

41:28.805 --> 41:35.227
And how can I be mad at anyone who can get Shirley to dress like a rabbit?

41:37.047 --> 41:39.289
She is a goddess, isn't she?

41:39.324 --> 41:41.458
Oh, boy.

41:49.070 --> 41:50.294
Denny, maybe for Christmas…

41:50.294 --> 41:52.137
You can't have her.

41:54.946 --> 41:57.102
–How about…
–No!

41:59.775 --> 42:02.877
Well, Merry Christmas just the same, my friend.

42:03.308 --> 42:05.297
Merry Christmas.

42:06.305 --> 42:12.532
