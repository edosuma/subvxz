By the way,
I saved your stuff.

21:32.136 --> 21:34.758
So that'swhere
those skin flakes went.

21:34.826 --> 21:36.654
Hmm. You think
this fruit tree's

21:36.723 --> 21:38.240
going to get
enough light?

21:38.309 --> 21:40.481
There's a window
in the closet.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.895
Whoa.

21:43.964 --> 21:45.550
This is huge.

21:45.619 --> 21:48.000
Bender, why don't
I just live in here?

21:48.067 --> 21:49.586
In a closet?

21:49.654 --> 21:51.448
[ Sighs ]
Oh, humans.
