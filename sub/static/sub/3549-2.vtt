WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.705
LIVES CHANGE IN FIVE YEARS.

00:04.705 --> 00:09.040
SOME FAMILIES GROW,
WHILE OTHERS GROW APART.

00:09.040 --> 00:12.183
SO I THOUGHT I'D BRING HIM BACK
SUNDAY AROUND 6:00 OR SO.
 FINE.

00:12.183 --> 00:15.146
AND WE FIND WAYS...
 IT'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

00:15.146 --> 00:17.118
TO EASE THE PAIN.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.620
YES, IN FIVE YEARS...

00:19.620 --> 00:22.123
EDIE, IS THAT REALLY YOU?
 I HAVE A HUSBAND NOW.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.624
MANY THINGS CHANGE.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.057
(man) You're required
to check in once a month.

00:26.057 --> 00:28.159
IT WAS A CONDITION
OF YOUR RELEASE.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.033
(Mary Alice) ALL IN ALL,

00:33.033 --> 00:38.109
SUSAN MAYER'S BOYFRIEND KNEW
HE HAD A LOT GOING FOR HIM.

00:38.109 --> 00:41.142
HE WAS ROMANTIC...

00:41.142 --> 00:42.773
MM.

00:42.773 --> 00:44.475
HAD A NICE SMILE...

00:46.177 --> 00:49.350
AND WAS
CONSISTENTLY THOUGHTFUL.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.051
(beep, whirring)

00:51.051 --> 00:55.586
YES, JACKSON BRADDOCK
HAD MANY WONDERFUL ATTRIBUTES.

00:55.586 --> 00:57.188
SADLY...

00:57.188 --> 01:01.262
A SENSE OF TIMING
WASN'T ONE OF THEM.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.433
HELLO.

01:02.433 --> 01:04.735
HI.

01:04.735 --> 01:06.397
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:06.397 --> 01:09.200
I GUESS YOU COULD
TELL SUSAN I'M HERE.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.143
OKAY. UH...
(chuckles) WHO ARE YOU?

01:12.143 --> 01:14.305
OH, I'M MIKE...
THE EX-HUSBAND.

01:14.305 --> 01:16.076
AH.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.708
I, UH, I TAKE IT YOU'RE...

01:17.708 --> 01:19.110
JACKSON.

01:19.110 --> 01:20.481
I'M, UH...

01:20.481 --> 01:21.852
SUSAN'S, UH...

01:21.852 --> 01:23.284
FRIEND?

01:23.284 --> 01:25.586
FRIEND. THAT'S RIGHT.
(chuckles nervously)

01:25.586 --> 01:28.719
WOW. (chuckles)
COULD THIS BE ANY MORE AWKWARD?

01:28.719 --> 01:31.122
WELL, YOUR ROBE'S OPEN...
SO YEAH.

01:31.122 --> 01:32.863
(clears throat) YEP.

01:32.863 --> 01:34.865
(Mike)
WELL, YOU BE THE JUDGE.

01:34.865 --> 01:36.867
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
IT--IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.800
WELL, I GOT THE FEELING THAT...
(speaks indistinctly)

01:39.800 --> 01:41.132
(sighs)

01:41.132 --> 01:44.305
(Mike and Jackson
continue speaking indistinctly)

01:44.305 --> 01:46.277
YEAH, YEAH.

01:46.277 --> 01:48.609
(gasps)

01:48.609 --> 01:50.211
OH!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.114
HEY, YOUR EX-HUSBAND IS...

01:54.114 --> 01:57.148
MIKE!
UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:57.148 --> 01:59.450
I WAS JUST RETURNING
M.J.'s VIDEO GAME.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.522
HE LEFT IT AT MY HOUSE.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.395
OH. THANKS.
SO I GUESS YOU MET JACKSON.

02:04.395 --> 02:05.856
YEAH. NICE LEGS.

02:05.856 --> 02:08.658
(sighs)
OH, CLEARLY THIS IS NOT

02:08.658 --> 02:11.662
HOW I WOULD'VE WANTED
THE TWO OF YOU TO MEET.

02:11.662 --> 02:14.165
HE'S--HE'S REALLY
A NICE GUY.

02:14.165 --> 02:16.136
YEAH, WELL, JUST TO MAKE SURE,
I'M GONNA NEED

02:16.136 --> 02:18.609
TO HANG WITH HIM A LITTLE BIT,
CHECK HIM OUT.

02:18.609 --> 02:20.871
OH, I DON'T KNOW THAT
THAT'S NECESSARY.

02:20.871 --> 02:23.474
IF HE'S SLEEPING
IN THE SAME HOUSE AS MY SON,

02:23.474 --> 02:25.145
I THINK IT IS.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.148
OH, WELL, FIRST OFF, UM, M.J.
WAS AT A SLEEPOVER LAST NIGHT.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.651
AND, IN FACT,
JACKSON AND HE HAVEN'T EVEN MET,

02:30.651 --> 02:33.854
SO, UH, THERE'S REALLY NO NEED
FOR YOU TO BE HANGING...

02:33.854 --> 02:35.726
OR CHECKING.
(chuckles nervously)

02:35.726 --> 02:39.630
OH, JUST... TELL JACKSON I'LL
PICK HIM UP HERE TOMORROW NIGHT.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.162
HEY, HOLD ON.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.165
YOU DON'T GET TO JUST DECIDE
THESE THINGS BY YOURSELF.

02:45.165 --> 02:49.800
YOU REMEMBER HOW NICE I WAS
ABOUT OUR CUSTODY AGREEMENT?

02:49.800 --> 02:52.643
I CAN HAUL YOU
BACK TO COURT TOMORROW

02:52.643 --> 02:56.707
IF I'M NOT 100% SATISFIED
WITH WHO YOU EXPOSE MY SON TO.

02:56.707 --> 02:59.810
GOT IT?

02:59.810 --> 03:02.813
(scoffs)
 (car door opens and shuts)

03:02.813 --> 03:04.615
(car engine starts)

03:04.615 --> 03:06.717
UH, I'M SORRY.

03:06.717 --> 03:10.921
IT'S SO NOT HOW I WANTED TO MEET
YOUR EX FOR THE FIRST TIME.

03:10.921 --> 03:13.464
WELL, WHEN YOU MEET HIM
FOR THE SECOND TIME,

03:13.464 --> 03:15.466
YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.798
HE'S PICKING YOU UP HERE
TOMORROW NIGHT.
 WHAT?

03:17.798 --> 03:20.231
I'LL EXPLAIN OVER BREAKFAST.

03:20.231 --> 03:22.233
DID YOU GET THE PAPER?

03:24.435 --> 03:27.838
AND THAT IS HOW
JACKSON BRADDOCK REALIZED

03:27.838 --> 03:30.311
HE NEEDED BETTER TIMING...

03:31.982 --> 03:34.945
WHO ARE YOU?

03:34.945 --> 03:37.348
AND A LONGER ROBE.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.304
IF THERE IS ONE THING EVERYONE
IN SUBURBIA CAN APPRECIATE...
 OH, HEY!

03:53.304 --> 03:54.805
IT'S A GOOD NEIGHBOR.

03:54.805 --> 03:56.807
YOU KNOW,
THE KIND THAT HELPS

03:56.807 --> 03:59.370
WITH THE LAST BAG
OF GROCERIES...

04:01.011 --> 04:03.744
OR BRINGS OVER
MISPLACED MAIL...

04:05.716 --> 04:08.719
OR OFFERS TO MOW YOUR LAWN.

04:08.719 --> 04:12.783
YES, EVERYONE APPRECIATES
A GOOD NEIGHBOR.

04:12.783 --> 04:14.985
YOU ARE SO SWEET TO DO THIS.

04:14.985 --> 04:17.827
I JUST KNOW HOW TRICKY
THESE BULBS CAN BE.

04:17.827 --> 04:20.391
AND NO ONE KNEW THIS BETTER
THAN DAVE WILLIAMS,

04:20.391 --> 04:22.393
WHO WAS DETERMINED TO BE

04:22.393 --> 04:27.968
THE BEST NEIGHBOR
WISTERIA LANE HAD EVER SEEN...

04:27.968 --> 04:29.840
ASSUMING, OF COURSE,

04:29.840 --> 04:32.973
HIS WIFE
DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.845
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:34.845 --> 04:36.647
PACKING OUR BAGS.

04:36.647 --> 04:38.649
KAREN McCLUSKEY
INSULTED ME AGAIN,

04:38.649 --> 04:40.811
AND I CAN'T PUT UP WITH IT
ANYMORE.

04:40.811 --> 04:43.584
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID SHE SAY
TO YOU THIS TIME?

04:43.584 --> 04:46.987
NOTHING. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE ARE MOVING.
 ADULTS DON'T PACK UP AND MOVE

04:46.987 --> 04:49.420
BECAUSE OF SOME
GOOD-NATURED TEASING.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.423
SHE SAID THAT MY BREASTS WERE
A TRIUMPH OF GERMAN ENGINEERING.

04:52.423 --> 04:54.294
YOU CALL THAT GOOD-NATURED?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.867
COME ON.
SHE'S A CRANKY OLD LADY.

04:56.867 --> 04:59.370
IT'S NOT JUST HER.
IT'S ALL OF THEM.

04:59.370 --> 05:02.573
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS.
I HAVE CHANGED.

05:02.573 --> 05:05.075
BUT THE PEOPLE ON THIS STREET
DON'T CARE.

05:05.075 --> 05:07.608
TO THEM,
I WILL ALWAYS BE A JOKE.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.410
(sighs)

05:09.410 --> 05:11.912
I'M SORRY
YOU HAD A BAD DAY.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.415
PLEASE DON'T USE
YOUR MOTIVATIONAL VOICE.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.016
I REALLY HATE THAT.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.649
YOU'RE UPSET
AND YOU'RE TIRED.

05:18.649 --> 05:21.051
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A NICE HOT SHOWER,

05:21.051 --> 05:23.724
AND I'LL MAKE US
SOME LUNCH?

05:23.724 --> 05:26.697
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

05:26.697 --> 05:30.100
(sighs)

05:30.100 --> 05:32.332
I JUST NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT.

05:32.332 --> 05:38.409
WE--WE COULD'VE GONE AND LIVED
IN ANY CITY IN THIS COUNTRY.

05:38.409 --> 05:42.613
WHY DID YOU INSIST
ON LIVING HERE?

05:42.613 --> 05:44.875
'CAUSE WE CAN BE HAPPY HERE.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.578
YOU JUST NEED
TO GIVE IT SOME TIME.

05:47.578 --> 05:50.421
AND I PROMISE,

05:50.421 --> 05:52.423
I'LL PERSONALLY SEE TO IT

05:52.423 --> 05:55.426
THAT PEOPLE START TREATING YOU
WITH A LITTLE MORE RESPECT.

05:55.426 --> 05:57.888
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION.

05:57.888 --> 06:00.631
DIDN'T I?

06:14.745 --> 06:18.008
CARLOS, WE GOT INVITED
TO MICHELLE DOWNING'S PARTY!

06:18.008 --> 06:20.881
I'M GONNA HAVE TO BUY
SOMETHING NICE TO--AAH!

06:20.881 --> 06:23.984
GABY, I'M GIVING A MASSAGE.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.686
I CAN SEE THAT.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.688
I CAN SEE
A LOT OF THINGS--

06:27.688 --> 06:29.890
THINGS THAT CAN
NEVER BE UNSEEN.

06:29.890 --> 06:34.064
UH, SORRY. I GUESS THE TOWEL
MUST'VE RODE UP.

06:34.064 --> 06:38.729
CARLOS? KITCHEN. NOW.

06:38.729 --> 06:42.473
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN I WORK DOWN HERE,

06:42.473 --> 06:44.835
BUT HE COULDN'T GET UP
THE STAIRS.

06:44.835 --> 06:47.738
HE'S GOT A BUM HIP.
 HE'S ALSO MISSING A TESTICLE.

06:47.738 --> 06:50.140
CARLOS, HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS
AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE?

06:50.140 --> 06:53.544
OKAY, OKAY, MAYBE I COULD
SET UP MY TABLE IN THE GARAGE.

06:53.544 --> 06:55.546
NO! THAT'S ONLY
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

06:55.546 --> 06:57.988
HAVE YOU CHECKED
OUR BANK BALANCE LATELY?

06:57.988 --> 07:00.721
GABY, I AM NOT TAKING
THE COUNTRY CLUB JOB.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.723
WHY NOT?
YOU'D BE MASSAGING RICH PEOPLE.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.996
THEY TIP BETTER
AND THEY TEND TO FLAKE LESS.
 YEAH, BUT I LIKE WORKING HERE.

07:05.996 --> 07:09.129
I GET TO SPEND LOTS OF TIME
WITH YOU AND THE KIDS.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.962
CARLOS, I DON'T NEED TO SPEND
LOTS OF TIME WITH YOU.

07:11.962 --> 07:14.835
AND FRANKLY,
THE KIDS ARE ON THE FENCE.
 GABY!

07:14.835 --> 07:17.968
BOTTOM LINE, I MISS OUR LIFE.
I MISS SHOPPING.

07:17.968 --> 07:19.970
ALL I HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO

07:19.970 --> 07:21.972
IS THE OCCASIONAL INVITATION
TO A FANCY PARTY.

07:21.972 --> 07:24.975
AND I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD A DRESS
TO GO TO IT.

07:24.975 --> 07:29.019
CARLOS, PLEASE,
I AM BEGGING YOU.
 FINE. I'LL--
I WILL TAKE THE JOB.

07:29.019 --> 07:31.482
THANK YOU.

07:31.482 --> 07:32.823
(Gabrielle screams)

07:32.823 --> 07:35.626
(man) SORRY.

07:37.888 --> 07:39.189
AH, NO. (sighs)

07:41.231 --> 07:43.063
(sighs)

07:43.063 --> 07:44.965
UNH-UNH.
 COME ON.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.138
I REALLY DON'T THINK MIKE'S
GONNA CARE WHAT SHIRT I WEAR.

07:48.138 --> 07:49.800
WELL, I DO.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.803
WE NEED A SHIRT THAT SAYS,
"I'M A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN,"

07:52.803 --> 07:56.076
NOT "MY FAVORITE CLOTHING STORE
ALSO SELLS BONGS."

07:56.076 --> 07:58.749
ARE YOU DISSING
MY SENSE OF STYLE?

07:58.749 --> 08:00.110
ABSOLUTELY.

08:00.110 --> 08:02.112
PUT THIS ON.

08:02.112 --> 08:03.754
NOW...

08:03.754 --> 08:06.757
LET'S TALK ABOUT ACCEPTABLE
TOPICS OF CONVERSATION.

08:06.757 --> 08:08.589
YOU LIKE SPORTS, RIGHT?

08:08.589 --> 08:11.161
YEAH. I'M A HUGE SOCCER FAN.
 NO, YOU'RE NOT.

08:11.161 --> 08:13.163
YOU LIKE FOOTBALL--
 AMERICAN FOOTBALL.

08:13.163 --> 08:15.165
SPECIFICALLY THE COLTS.
 OKAY.

08:15.165 --> 08:17.227
AND HERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT--

08:17.227 --> 08:18.929
CARS, BARBECUE, FISHING.

08:18.929 --> 08:21.832
HOW ABOUT FIRE?
MIKE LIKE TALK FIRE?

08:21.832 --> 08:24.234
JACKSON,
PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

08:24.234 --> 08:27.738
I AM. I'M JUST--I'M NOT GONNA
PRETEND TO BE SOMEBODY I'M NOT.

08:27.738 --> 08:29.980
IF HE DOESN'T LIKE ME,
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

08:29.980 --> 08:31.982
HE COULD TAKE ME TO COURT,

08:31.982 --> 08:34.985
AND THE JUDGE CAN MAKE ME
CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU AND MY SON.

08:34.985 --> 08:37.047
AND I'M SORRY.
YOU WILL LOSE.

08:37.047 --> 08:38.818
PEYTON MANNING

08:38.818 --> 08:41.652
IS THE GREATEST QUARTERBACK
WHO EVER LIVED.

08:41.652 --> 08:43.123
THANK YOU.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.799
NOW GO SHAVE.
YOU LOOK LIKE A HOBO.

08:51.862 --> 08:55.606
(funk music
playing indistinctly)

08:55.606 --> 08:58.108
HEY.

08:58.108 --> 08:59.610
GOT A SEC?

08:59.610 --> 09:01.241
NOT REALLY.

09:01.241 --> 09:06.176
SO I ASSUME YOU KNOW ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO JIMMY CONRADO.

09:06.176 --> 09:08.779
I GUESS.

09:08.779 --> 09:11.081
YOUR FRIEND GETS BUSTED
FOR DEALING DRUGS AT SCHOOL,

09:11.081 --> 09:13.684
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY IS,
"I GUESS"?

09:13.684 --> 09:16.857
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.859
YOU WERE ON THE SAME
LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.091
YEAH, LIKE A MILLION YEARS AGO.
ANYTHING ELSE?

09:24.134 --> 09:26.166
NO.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.668
NOT REALLY.

09:30.941 --> 09:32.843
HEY.

09:32.843 --> 09:34.204
PARKER.

09:34.204 --> 09:37.177
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING,
JUST BETWEEN US?

09:37.177 --> 09:40.010
DOES PORTER HANG OUT
WITH JIMMY CONRADO?

09:40.010 --> 09:44.014
I DON'T KNOW. I COULD CHECK OUT
HIS FRIENDS LIST ON SILVERFIZZ.
 HIS WHAT ON WHAT?

09:46.316 --> 09:48.318
IT'S LIKE MySpace.
YOU HAVE A WEB PAGE.

09:48.318 --> 09:50.921
IT SHOWS YOUR HOBBIES,
YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC,

09:50.921 --> 09:53.163
AND YOU CAN TALK TO PEOPLE.

09:53.163 --> 09:55.866
REALLY?
CAN ANYONE TALK TO HIM?

09:55.866 --> 09:58.098
YEAH.
HE JUST HAS TO INVITE YOU.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.031
AND, UH...

10:01.031 --> 10:03.333
HOW WOULD SOMEBODY
MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.008
NOW IT'S JUST A MOCK-UP,

10:08.008 --> 10:10.711
BUT THIS IS WHAT
THE BOOK IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.113
MOM, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
GOOD CALL ON THE FONT.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.987
THANK YOU, DEAR.

10:16.987 --> 10:18.989
ORSON, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:18.989 --> 10:20.991
WELL, I THINK IT'S STRANGE

10:20.991 --> 10:23.293
TO SEE MY WIFE BILLED
AS "MRS. VAN DE KAMP."

10:23.293 --> 10:27.728
WELL, YOU KNEW WHAT THE BOOK
WAS GONNA BE CALLED.
 YES, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
ACTUALLY SEEING IT.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.101
I MEAN, IS IT TOO LATE
TO GO WITH "MRS. HODGE"?

10:31.101 --> 10:33.403
MY COMPANY, WHICH I FORMED
WHEN WE WERE SEPARATED,

10:33.403 --> 10:36.236
IS CALLED
MRS. VAN DE KAMP'S CATERING.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.238
IT'S HOW I'M KNOWN.
 OH, IN FAIRVIEW.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.811
BUT THIS BOOK
WILL BE NATIONAL.

10:40.811 --> 10:42.973
I MEAN, IT'S YOUR CHANCE
TO REBRAND YOURSELF.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.975
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH "HODGE"?

10:46.717 --> 10:49.950
I THINK I JUST HEARD THE MILK
GO BAD. I SHOULD CHECK.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.082
ORSON, I ADORE YOU,

10:52.082 --> 10:55.926
BUT YOUR NAME... OUR NAME--
IT HAS NO MUSIC.

10:55.926 --> 10:58.228
"VAN DE KAMP"
TRIPS OFF THE TONGUE.

10:58.228 --> 11:01.191
"HODGE" SOUNDS LIKE
THE NOISE A PLUNGER MAKES.

11:01.191 --> 11:02.963
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.134
LISTEN...

11:04.134 --> 11:05.095
(brightly) VAN DE KAMP.

11:05.095 --> 11:06.266
(flatly) HODGE.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.268
ALSO, SHE'S GOT
A RADIO INTERVIEW WEDNESDAY,

11:08.268 --> 11:11.201
AND THEY'RE ALREADY PROMOTING
HER AS MRS. VAN DE KAMP.

11:11.201 --> 11:13.203
SEE? THE SHIP
HAS ALREADY SAILED.

11:13.203 --> 11:16.176
OH, DON'T BE HURT.
IT'S MY PROFESSIONAL NAME.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.049
IN THIS HOUSE,
I WILL ALWAYS BE MRS. HODGE.

11:19.049 --> 11:22.052
NOW... WOULD IT HELP
IF MRS. HODGE

11:22.052 --> 11:24.885
COOKED YOU
YOUR FAVORITE POT ROAST TONIGHT?

11:24.885 --> 11:28.058
YES, I GUESS IT WOULD HELP.

11:28.058 --> 11:31.191
UH, MEETING
WITH YOUR PUBLICIST?

11:31.191 --> 11:35.365
OH, RIGHT.
UM, TOMORROW FOR SURE, THEN.

11:35.365 --> 11:37.067
(chuckles)

11:39.169 --> 11:41.271
(flatly) VAN DE KAMP. HMM.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.335
(brightly) HODGE.

11:45.335 --> 11:49.980
(purring)

11:52.112 --> 11:54.114
HERE YOU GO.
 OH, THANK YOU.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.117
TOBY, GET OFF MY CHAIR.
YOU KNOW BETTER.
 (meows)

11:57.117 --> 11:59.790
SO WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

11:59.790 --> 12:01.191
IT'S EDIE.

12:01.191 --> 12:03.153
YOU SAID SOMETHING
TO HER YESTERDAY

12:03.153 --> 12:05.255
THAT HURT HER FEELINGS.

12:05.255 --> 12:08.228
THAT THING ABOUT HER BREASTS?
COME ON. THAT WAS A JOKE.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.230
PERHAPS,
BUT IT UPSET HER SO MUCH

12:10.230 --> 12:13.103
THAT SHE SUGGESTED
WE LEAVE WISTERIA LANE.

12:13.103 --> 12:15.105
I CAN'T HAVE THAT, MRS. M.

12:15.105 --> 12:18.108
HEY, THIS IS WHAT EDIE AND I DO.
WE TEASE EACH OTHER.

12:18.108 --> 12:21.111
I SAY SHE'S EASIER TO
GET INTO THAN COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

12:21.111 --> 12:23.343
SHE SAYS MY FACE
LOOKS LIKE A KNEE.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.045
(chuckles) IT'S FUN.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.948
STILL... I WOULD CONSIDER IT
A PERSONAL FAVOR

12:27.948 --> 12:29.950
IF YOU'D APOLOGIZE TO HER.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.183
YOU KNOW, MAKE HER FEEL
ACCEPTED AND LOVED.

12:33.183 --> 12:35.385
NO.

12:37.127 --> 12:38.458
NO?

12:38.458 --> 12:41.461
IF EDIE WANTS TO CHANGE THE WAY
WE TALK TO EACH OTHER,

12:41.461 --> 12:43.463
SHE'S GOTTA ASK ME
PERSONALLY.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.465
AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF GALL

12:45.465 --> 12:47.467
MAKING ME FEEL LIKE I DID
SOMETHING WRONG

12:47.467 --> 12:50.100
WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW ME.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.803
OH... I KNOW YOU,

12:52.803 --> 12:54.274
BETTER THAN YOU THINK.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.545
OH, REALLY?

12:55.545 --> 12:57.177
FOR STARTERS,

12:57.177 --> 13:00.210
YOU TALK TO YOUR CAT
LIKE IT'S A PERSON.

13:00.210 --> 13:04.114
WHEN I KNOCKED ON YOUR DOOR,
YOU IMMEDIATELY INVITED ME IN.

13:04.114 --> 13:07.117
DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS
TO SEE THAT YOU'RE LONELY.

13:09.219 --> 13:14.194
I'M THINKING YOU HAD PEOPLE
IN YOUR LIFE AT ONE TIME...

13:14.194 --> 13:17.097
PEOPLE WHO CARED ABOUT YOU.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.099
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO THEM.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.202
SOME PROBABLY DIED.
THE REST, WELL...

13:22.202 --> 13:24.504
THEY JUST DON'T
COME AROUND MUCH ANYMORE.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.506
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

13:29.079 --> 13:31.081
I KNOW YOU, MRS. McCLUSKEY.

13:31.081 --> 13:33.083
(Toby meows)
 AND IT SEEMS TO ME

13:33.083 --> 13:35.385
THAT A WOMAN LIKE YOU
WOULD LIKE TO KEEP

13:35.385 --> 13:38.889
THE FEW FRIENDS
THAT SHE HAS LEFT.

13:38.889 --> 13:41.521
I THINK YOU'D BETTER GO.

14:05.615 --> 14:07.617
(vehicle door shuts)

14:09.119 --> 14:10.620
HEY...
 (engine idling)

14:10.620 --> 14:12.622
THANKS FOR TONIGHT.

14:12.622 --> 14:15.055
AND, UH, BEFORE I FORGET,
THE COLTS SUCK.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.058
(laughs) OH, HERE'S WHAT SUCKS--
WATCHING A ZERO-ZERO GAME

14:18.058 --> 14:20.230
WITH NO CHEERLEADERS,
SOCCER BOY.

14:20.230 --> 14:21.561
AH!
 (laughs)

14:25.535 --> 14:29.299
YOU GUYS WERE INSULTING
EACH OTHER. THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
 YEAH, WE HAD A BLAST.

14:29.299 --> 14:30.540
REALLY?
 YEAH.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.243
IN FACT, WE'RE GETTING TOGETHER
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT O'BRIEN'S,

14:33.243 --> 14:36.306
WHICH HE CLAIMS HAS THE BEST
BACON POTATO SKINS IN TOWN.

14:36.306 --> 14:39.009
POTATO SKINS AT O'BRIEN'S?
YOU'VE MADE HIS INNER CIRCLE!

14:39.009 --> 14:42.012
THIS IS FANTASTIC!
THANK YOU. MMM.
 MMM.

14:42.012 --> 14:44.254
AH, YOU CAN THINK OF

14:44.254 --> 14:47.887
A MORE CREATIVE WAY
TO THANK ME THAN THAT.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.219
MMM.

14:51.521 --> 14:53.263
MMM.

14:53.263 --> 14:54.494
AHH.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.665
OHH.

14:55.665 --> 14:57.197
OH. (laughs)

14:57.197 --> 14:58.168
NICE.

14:58.168 --> 14:59.499
(gasps)
 YEAH?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.331
YEAH. MMM.

15:01.331 --> 15:02.672
OH, WOW.

15:02.672 --> 15:04.674
YOU'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
(giggles)

15:04.674 --> 15:07.577
(panting) WAIT.

15:07.577 --> 15:10.580
YOU'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT NOW?

15:10.580 --> 15:13.283
I DON'T KNOW.
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

15:13.283 --> 15:16.646
YEAH. BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WOULD LIKE IT?

15:18.618 --> 15:20.190
OH, MY GOD.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.552
WHAT?

15:22.552 --> 15:25.255
MIKE TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE EAR THING, DIDN'T HE?

15:25.255 --> 15:26.426
NO.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.698
SO YOU JUST HAPPENED

15:28.698 --> 15:30.700
TO STUMBLE ACROSS
MY SECRET TURN-ON

15:30.700 --> 15:33.703
THE SAME NIGHT THAT
YOU AND MIKE BECAME B.F.F.s?

15:33.703 --> 15:37.067
BUT AREN'T WE LOSING SIGHT
OF THE FACT THAT YOU LIKE IT?

15:37.067 --> 15:39.069
THIS IS...
I MEAN, I'M JUST...

15:39.069 --> 15:40.540
I HAVE BEEN VIOLATED.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.242
OH, HONEY, COME ON--

15:42.242 --> 15:45.245
DON'T TOUCH ME! OR MY EARS!
MY EARS ARE DEAD TO YOU.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.547
IT JUST SLIPPED OUT. WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT HOW GIRLS--

15:47.547 --> 15:49.949
THEY--THEY ALL LIKE
DIFFERENT THINGS, RIGHT?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.422
AND I-I WAS TALKING ABOUT
THIS GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL,

15:52.422 --> 15:55.225
HOW SHE LIKED TO DO IT
WITH HER SHOES ON,

15:55.225 --> 15:57.627
AND--AND MIKE TALKED
ABOUT THE LOBE NIBBLE.
 HE HAS A NAME FOR IT?

15:57.627 --> 15:59.459
(scoffs) OKAY.

15:59.459 --> 16:03.193
THAT'S IT. YOU AND MIKE
ARE NOT HANGING OUT ANYMORE.

16:03.193 --> 16:04.664
AND THIS LITTLE

16:04.664 --> 16:08.168
WEDNESDAY "POTATO SKINS
AND SUSAN SEX TIPS NIGHT"?

16:08.168 --> 16:11.001
I FORBID IT.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.244
(sighs)

16:14.244 --> 16:16.546
DID MIKE MENTION HE LIKES
HAVING HIS TOES SUCKED?

16:16.546 --> 16:19.579
OOPS! (chuckles)
THAT JUST SLIPPED OUT. HMM.

16:24.314 --> 16:26.616
GABY...

16:26.616 --> 16:30.320
BREE! WHAT'S UP?

16:30.320 --> 16:33.693
WELL, UM, MICHELLE DOWNING
ASKED ME TO SPEAK TO YOU.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.695
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD,

16:35.695 --> 16:39.699
BUT I'M CATERING
HER BIRTHDAY PARTY--
 I HEARD. I CAN'T WAIT.
OOH, I WAS GONNA ASK YOU.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.701
SHOULD I WEAR
THE NAVY BLUE CHANEL

16:41.701 --> 16:45.035
OR THE RED SLEEVELESS DRESS?
 YOU CAN'T COME.

16:45.035 --> 16:46.376
SORRY.

16:46.376 --> 16:49.079
I JUST HAD
TO RIP THE BAND-AID OFF.

16:49.079 --> 16:51.681
WHAT?
SHE'S DISINVITING ME?

16:51.681 --> 16:53.443
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

16:53.443 --> 16:55.445
YOU KNOW HOW CARLOS
JUST STARTED AT THE CLUB?

16:55.445 --> 16:57.447
WELL, HER GUESTS
ARE ALL MEMBERS,

16:57.447 --> 16:59.449
AND SHE THINKS
THEY MIGHT FIND IT AWKWARD

16:59.449 --> 17:01.591
SOCIALIZING WITH...

17:01.591 --> 17:02.752
STAFF.

17:02.752 --> 17:04.723
SHE CALLED US "STAFF"?

17:04.723 --> 17:08.157
OH, GABY, IT'S JUST ONE PARTY.
I'LL SAVE YOU SOME CAKE.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.329
NO! IT'S NOT JUST ONE PARTY!

17:10.329 --> 17:12.332
IT'S THE KICKOFF
TO THE WHOLE SOCIAL SEASON.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.135
IF PEOPLE SEE
WE'RE OFF MICHELLE'S LIST,

17:15.135 --> 17:17.137
THEN WE'LL BE OFF EVERYONE'S.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.270
AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE
THE START OF OUR SLOW SLIDE

17:20.270 --> 17:22.742
FROM GOWNS AND GALAS
TO FLIP-FLOPS AND KEGGERS!

17:22.742 --> 17:27.247
(sighs) OKAY, IF CARLOS WORKING
AT THE CLUB IS THE PROBLEM,

17:27.247 --> 17:29.249
THEN TELL HER HE JUST QUIT.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.551
OH, HON, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA FLY.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.823
HE'S ALREADY RUBBED
TOO MANY MEMBERS.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.158
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MY LIFE?

17:38.158 --> 17:41.591
WE USED TO HAVE HELP.
NOW WE ARE THE HELP!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.096
HEY.

17:46.096 --> 17:47.797
HEY.
 (typing on keyboard)

17:47.797 --> 17:49.599
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:49.599 --> 17:52.542
I AM JUST...

17:52.542 --> 17:55.475
TALKING TO PORTER
ON SILVERFIZZ.

17:55.475 --> 17:59.109
WHO IS SaraJ
FROM MacARTHUR HIGH SCHOOL?

17:59.109 --> 18:00.780
ME.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.452
I'M 16 AND CUTE.

18:02.452 --> 18:05.455
I LIKE GRAPHIC NOVELS
AND TOKYO POLICE CLUB.
 (whispers) OH, MY GOD.

18:05.455 --> 18:08.218
(normal voice) YOU--YOU'RE
PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE?

18:08.218 --> 18:10.220
OUR BROODING SON
HAS A CLASSMATE

18:10.220 --> 18:12.222
WHO GOT ARRESTED
FOR SELLING DRUGS.

18:12.222 --> 18:15.795
I REALLY THINK THE END
JUSTIFIES THE MEANS HERE.
 (typing on keyboard)

18:15.795 --> 18:18.798
OKAY, WE'LL ADDRESS YOUR MAJOR
ETHICAL BREACH IN A MOMENT.

18:20.370 --> 18:24.374
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
 WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS

18:24.374 --> 18:27.307
HE REALLY DOESN'T HANG OUT
WITH JIMMY CONRADO.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.210
BUT I AM A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT Anita47,

18:30.210 --> 18:33.343
WHO TOLD HIM CHERRY FRUIT POPS
ARE AN APHRODISIAC.

18:33.343 --> 18:34.644
HUH? (laughs)
 (laughs)

18:34.644 --> 18:37.647
OKAY, GREAT, YOU KNOW
WHO HE HANGS AROUND WITH NOW.

18:37.647 --> 18:40.520
YOU GOT WHAT YOU CAME FOR.
TIME TO STOP.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.393
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
IT'S JUST...

18:43.393 --> 18:47.397
DID YOU KNOW
PORTER WRITES POETRY?

18:47.397 --> 18:49.399
SERIOUS?
 YEAH.

18:49.399 --> 18:50.530
OUR PORTER,

18:50.530 --> 18:53.233
THE KID WHO COMMUNICATES
WITH GRUNTS AND SHRUGS,

18:53.233 --> 18:54.664
WRITES THIS...

18:54.664 --> 18:58.508
BEAUTIFUL,
HEART-WRENCHING POETRY.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.872
MAYBE ONE DAY
HE'LL SHARE IT WITH YOU

19:02.872 --> 19:05.315
INSTEAD OF
YOUR FANTASY ALTER EGO.

19:05.315 --> 19:08.248
UNTIL THEN, SHUT IT OFF.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.719
OKAY, OKAY.
 (click)

19:09.719 --> 19:11.751
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.253
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:33.803 --> 19:36.406
(alert chimes)

19:38.177 --> 19:40.950
(chuckles)
 (typing on keyboard)

19:40.950 --> 19:42.882
(beep)

19:45.955 --> 19:49.359
(alert chimes)

19:50.720 --> 19:52.592
OH, REALLY?

19:52.592 --> 19:54.564
(types on keyboard)

19:54.564 --> 19:56.266
(alert chimes)

19:58.197 --> 20:00.930
(alert chimes)

20:00.930 --> 20:04.304
(typing)

20:04.304 --> 20:05.905
(alert chimes)

20:05.905 --> 20:07.577
(alert chimes)

20:09.609 --> 20:13.383
AW. THAT'S SWEET.

20:13.383 --> 20:15.385
(typing)

20:15.385 --> 20:16.746
(alert chimes)

20:16.746 --> 20:18.588
(alert chimes)

20:23.253 --> 20:25.425
STILL TALKING
TO POETRY GIRL?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.996
BITE ME.

20:26.996 --> 20:28.998
DUDE, SHE DIDN'T PUT UP
HER PHOTO.

20:28.998 --> 20:33.433
5 BUCKS SAYS SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE CAME OUT OF AN EGG.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.435
(chuckles) WHATEVER.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.507
(resumes typing)

20:37.507 --> 20:40.470
TOBY?
(makes kissing sounds)

20:40.470 --> 20:42.972
TOBY! WHERE ARE YOU?

20:42.972 --> 20:45.315
TOBY!

20:45.315 --> 20:48.318
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MRS. M.?

20:48.318 --> 20:50.320
IT'S TOBY.
I CAN'T FIND HIM.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.322
OH, NO.
HOW DID HE GET OUT?

20:52.322 --> 20:55.355
THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW WAS OPEN,
WHICH IS BIZARRE

20:55.355 --> 20:57.527
BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER
OPENING IT.

20:57.527 --> 21:00.330
CAN YOU HELP ME FIND HIM?

21:00.330 --> 21:03.963
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY MORE THOUGHT
ABOUT APOLOGIZING TO EDIE?

21:03.963 --> 21:07.337
SHE'S STILL
PRETTY DOWN IN THE DUMPS.

21:07.337 --> 21:09.339
I'VE KIND OF BEEN BUSY.

21:09.339 --> 21:12.602
OF COURSE YOU HAVE.
IT'S JUST THAT...

21:12.602 --> 21:15.605
WELL, SINCE I'M ABOUT
TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR CAT,

21:15.605 --> 21:18.608
IT SURE WOULD BE NICE IF
YOU COULD HELP ME OUT WITH EDIE.

21:18.608 --> 21:21.411
DOESN'T THAT SEEM FAIR
TO YOU?

21:21.411 --> 21:23.353
I GUESS.

21:23.353 --> 21:25.515
HERE.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.421
THANK YOU.

21:31.421 --> 21:33.993
OKAY. TOBY!

21:33.993 --> 21:35.865
TOBY! COME HERE, BOY!

21:35.865 --> 21:39.399
(whistles) TOBY!

21:39.399 --> 21:42.402
SO THEY'LL FINISH WITH THE NEWS,
DO A QUICK TRAFFIC UPDATE,

21:42.402 --> 21:45.304
AND THEN WE'RE ON THE AIR.
UH, DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

21:45.304 --> 21:47.707
NO, I'M GOOD.
HOW DO I LOOK?
 (man speaking indistinctly
on radio)

21:47.707 --> 21:49.739
(chuckles)
WE'RE ON THE RADIO.

21:49.739 --> 21:52.311
OH.
I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.744
THIS IS
MY FIRST NATIONAL INTERVIEW.

21:54.744 --> 21:57.447
AND I AM A HUGE FAN
OF YOUR COOKBOOKS.

21:57.447 --> 21:59.449
WELL, I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS
ABOUT YOU.

21:59.449 --> 22:00.990
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE CATERING

22:00.990 --> 22:03.753
MICHELLE DOWNING'S
BIRTHDAY DINNER TONIGHT.

22:03.753 --> 22:06.626
OH, YOU KNOW MICHELLE?
 YES, AND I'LL BE THERE.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.828
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT YOU DISH UP.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.431
OKAY, NOW I'M TERRIFIED.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.062
♪♪♪

22:13.062 --> 22:15.635
HERE WE GO.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.966
GOOD AFTERNOON.

22:16.966 --> 22:20.670
I'M LINDA FLANAGAN,
AND THIS IS "GOURMET AMERICANA."

22:20.670 --> 22:22.672
(Linda) IF YOU'VE BEEN
TO FAIRVIEW'S BEST PARTIES,

22:22.672 --> 22:24.674
THEN YOU'VE PROBABLY TASTED
THE MOUTHWATERING FOOD

22:24.674 --> 22:27.647
DISHED UP BY MY FIRST GUEST,
BREE VAN DE KAMP.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.019
NOW SHE'S ABOUT TO PUBLISH
HER FIRST BOOK,

22:30.019 --> 22:32.452
"MRS. VAN DE KAMP'S
OLD-FASHIONED COOKING."

22:32.452 --> 22:33.883
WELCOME, BREE.

22:33.883 --> 22:35.124
HI, LINDA.

22:35.124 --> 22:37.356
TELL ME.
WHY "OLD-FASHIONED"?

22:37.356 --> 22:40.490
WELL, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
MISS THE WAY LIFE USED TO BE--

22:40.490 --> 22:42.792
BACK WHEN WOMEN
HAD MORE TIME TO COOK.

22:42.792 --> 22:44.764
IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN IMPORTANT TO ME

22:44.764 --> 22:47.767
TO HAVE THE FAMILY GATHER
AROUND THE TABLE EVERY NIGHT

22:47.767 --> 22:49.599
FOR HOT, LOVINGLY PREPARED
MEALS.

22:49.599 --> 22:51.801
SO YOU'RE
A TRADITIONAL KINDA GAL.

22:51.801 --> 22:54.974
IS THERE A MR. VAN DE KAMP?

22:54.974 --> 22:56.576
NO.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.809
UH, MR. VAN DE KAMP
IS DECEASED.
 OH.

22:59.809 --> 23:01.881
BUT IN REGARDS
TO MY HUSBAND,

23:01.881 --> 23:04.714
I SHOULD MAKE ONE THING
VERY CLEAR--

23:04.714 --> 23:07.657
HIS PASSING HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH MY COOKING.

23:07.657 --> 23:11.591
(Bree and Linda laughing)

23:13.763 --> 23:15.995
HEY.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.498
IS THAT MY YEATS BOOK?
I LOVE HIS POETRY.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.700
YEAH. I'M BORROWING IT
FOR SCHOOL.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.171
AH.

23:22.171 --> 23:25.174
THIS IS THE KIND OF POETRY
THAT MELTS A GIRL'S HEART.

23:25.174 --> 23:27.176
SO ROMANTIC.

23:27.176 --> 23:29.178
OH! HERE'S A GREAT ONE--

23:29.178 --> 23:32.742
"THE LOVER TELLS
OF THE ROSE IN HIS HEART."

23:32.742 --> 23:36.015
MY FIRST BOYFRIEND
GAVE ME THIS POEM.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.848
I WAS A JUNIOR IN--
 MOM, I'M--I'M RUNNING LATE.
CAN I HAVE THE BOOK BACK?

23:38.848 --> 23:41.951
OH. SORRY.

23:44.994 --> 23:46.956
(front door opens)
 ENJOY!

23:46.956 --> 23:48.458
(door shuts)

23:52.001 --> 23:55.665
KATHERINE, IT IS NOT TOO LATE
TO CHANGE TONIGHT'S MENU.

23:55.665 --> 23:57.667
IF LINDA FLANAGAN LIKES MY FOOD,

23:57.667 --> 24:00.740
SHE MIGHT GIVE ME A QUOTE
FOR THE BOOK JACKET.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.742
I HAVE TO KNOCK HER SOCKS OFF,

24:02.742 --> 24:05.144
AND I AM NOT BETTING THE FARM
ON HADDOCK.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.146
ARGUE WITH ME ALL YOU LIKE.

24:07.146 --> 24:11.521
I JUST BOUGHT 40 POUNDS OF PORK,
SO GET YOUR TUSHIE OVER HERE.

24:11.521 --> 24:14.854
ORSON! DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE
ABOUT LINDA FLANAGAN?

24:14.854 --> 24:16.155
YES, I HEARD.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.958
ISN'T IT AMAZING?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.230
MM. ALMOST AS AMAZING
AS MY ON-AIR DEATH NOTICE.

24:21.230 --> 24:23.232
WHAT?

24:23.232 --> 24:25.234
"SO, BREE,
DO YOU HAVE A HUSBAND?"

24:25.234 --> 24:28.638
"NOPE. USED TO. HE CROAKED."
 (chuckles) SHE DIDN'T ASK
IF I HAD A HUSBAND.

24:28.638 --> 24:31.140
SHE ASKED IF THERE WAS
A MR. VAN DE KAMP,

24:31.140 --> 24:33.603
AND THERE'S CLEARLY NOT.
 WELL, THERE'S A MR. HODGE.

24:33.603 --> 24:36.475
WOULD IT HAVE KILLED YOU
TO HAVE MENTIONED ME?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.147
AND WASTE VALUABLE AIRTIME?

24:38.147 --> 24:40.149
THE SHOW
WAS ABOUT MY COOKBOOK,

24:40.149 --> 24:42.782
NOT ABOUT MY TORTURED
MARITAL HISTORY.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.784
THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.486
IT'S BECAUSE I WENT TO JAIL,
ISN'T IT?

24:47.486 --> 24:50.489
ORSON, I HAVE 6 HOURS
TO PREPARE A MEAL FOR 80 PEOPLE.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.822
WE'RE NOT HAVING
THIS DISCUSSION NOW.

24:52.822 --> 24:55.164
JUST ADMIT IT.
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF ME.

24:55.164 --> 24:56.666
SHOULD I BE PROUD?

24:56.666 --> 24:59.669
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO ON THE RADIO AND BOAST

24:59.669 --> 25:02.572
THAT MY HUSBAND SERVED TIME
FOR RUNNING SOMEONE OVER?

25:02.572 --> 25:05.034
I WENT TO JAIL
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME

25:05.034 --> 25:07.537
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
YOU'D TAKE ME BACK.

25:07.537 --> 25:10.509
AND BECAUSE IT WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.511
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW THEN

25:12.511 --> 25:15.284
THAT I WOULD BE
A PUBLIC FIGURE SOMEDAY.

25:15.284 --> 25:17.286
BUT I AM. I HAVE A NAME NOW.

25:17.286 --> 25:19.549
AND LUCKILY FOR YOU,
IT'S NOT MINE.

25:19.549 --> 25:22.852
ORSON, PLEASE DON'T BE HURT.

25:22.852 --> 25:25.825
I AM UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE
AND SO TERRIFIED I'LL FAIL

25:25.825 --> 25:28.898
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING HALF THE TIME.

25:28.898 --> 25:30.900
JUST LET ME
GET THROUGH THIS.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.532
AS SOON AS THE PLATES
GO OUT TONIGHT,

25:33.532 --> 25:36.535
I WILL COME HOME AND COOK YOU
THAT POT ROAST I PROMISED.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.837
OKAY?

25:40.009 --> 25:41.310
OKAY.
 HMM.

25:41.310 --> 25:43.012
(kisses)

25:43.012 --> 25:45.314
(sighs)
IT'S JUST THAT... I--

25:45.314 --> 25:49.018
CHIVES!
HOW COULD I FORGET CHIVES?

25:59.188 --> 26:01.290
(beep)
 (Jackson) Hey, Susan, it's me.

26:01.290 --> 26:04.293
Listen, I'm not gonna be able
to make dinner tonight.

26:04.293 --> 26:06.295
My college roommate's in town,

26:06.295 --> 26:09.298
and this is the only night
we can get together.

26:09.298 --> 26:11.300
OH. IS HIS NAME MIKE DELFINO?

26:11.300 --> 26:14.143
DID YOU ROOM TOGETHER
AT LIARS' COLLEGE?

26:14.143 --> 26:16.646
Um, I know it's last-minute,
and I'm really sorry,

26:16.646 --> 26:18.608
but I still wanna see you.

26:18.608 --> 26:21.981
So how about I drop by later?
Call me if that's a problem.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.152
(beep)

26:23.152 --> 26:25.154
YEAH, YOU'LL DROP BY LATER...

26:25.154 --> 26:27.156
WITH POTATO SKINS
ON YOUR BREATH,

26:27.156 --> 26:29.358
YOU MISERABLE TWO-TIMER!

26:29.358 --> 26:31.921
WHAT'S WRONG, MOM?

26:31.921 --> 26:33.863
NOTHING.

26:33.863 --> 26:37.196
JUST, THE ANSWERING MACHINE
LIED TO MOMMY.

26:39.368 --> 26:42.802
(alert chimes)

26:42.802 --> 26:44.634
(gasps)

26:44.634 --> 26:46.275
(alert chimes)

26:49.178 --> 26:53.042
OH, CRAP ON THINGS.

26:53.042 --> 26:55.044
CRAP ON WHAT THINGS?

26:55.044 --> 26:57.246
UM...

26:57.246 --> 26:59.949
(blows raspberry)

26:59.949 --> 27:02.391
PORTER SENT ME A SEX POEM.

27:02.391 --> 27:04.894
WHAT? WHY?

27:04.894 --> 27:08.698
HE MAY BE IN LOVE WITH ME.

27:08.698 --> 27:11.360
WHY WOULD HE BE IN LOVE
WITH YOU?

27:11.360 --> 27:14.163
OKAY...
REMEMBER HOW YOU TOLD ME

27:14.163 --> 27:16.666
I SHOULD STOP
TALKING TO HIM ONLINE?

27:16.666 --> 27:19.168
WELL, OF COURSE, I DIDN'T,

27:19.168 --> 27:21.941
AND I SORT OF TOLD HIM
I LIKED HIS POETRY.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.944
YOU TOLD A TEENAGE BOY
THAT YOU LIKED HIS POETRY?

27:24.944 --> 27:27.276
JEEZ, LYNETTE!
WHY NOT JUST FLASH HIM A BOOB?

27:27.276 --> 27:29.679
SHH! HE'LL HEAR YOU.
 SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

27:29.679 --> 27:32.321
ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM
THE TRUTH NOW, OR ARE YOU GONNA

27:32.321 --> 27:35.284
WAIT UNTIL AFTER HE KILLS ME
AND BLINDS HIMSELF?

27:35.284 --> 27:38.287
CALM DOWN. I'M GONNA
BREAK IT OFF IN AN E-MAIL.

27:38.287 --> 27:40.930
OH, GREAT. JUST LIKE THAT?
THAT'LL KILL HIM.

27:40.930 --> 27:42.962
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ONLY BEEN
ON THE RECEIVING END

27:42.962 --> 27:46.035
OF BREAK-UP LETTERS,
BUT I'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN A FEW,

27:46.035 --> 27:48.397
AND I KNOW
HOW TO LET HIM DOWN EASY.

27:48.397 --> 27:49.899
"DEAR PORTER,

27:49.899 --> 27:51.400
"I REALLY LIKE YOU,

27:51.400 --> 27:54.373
BUT I WANNA SEE
OTHER OFFSPRING."

27:54.373 --> 27:57.046
GO AWAY.

28:02.311 --> 28:04.313
(piano playing in distance)
 YOU KNOW,
I'M KINDA SURPRISED

28:04.313 --> 28:06.285
WE STILL MADE
MICHELLE'S LIST THIS YEAR,

28:06.285 --> 28:08.287
WHAT WITH ME WORKING
AT THE CLUB.

28:08.287 --> 28:11.290
OH, DON'T BE SILLY, CARLOS.
WE'RE STILL ON EVERYONE'S LIST.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.992
(chuckles)

28:12.992 --> 28:15.224
NOW LET'S GO.
 OKAY.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.002
(loud clattering)
 GABY, ARE WE IN
THE BANQUET HALL?

28:23.002 --> 28:26.005
WHAT'S ALL THE NOISE?
 OH, IT'S JUST THE CATERERS

28:26.005 --> 28:28.007
PUTTING GLASSES
AND SILVERWARE ON THE TABLES.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.009
THEY MAKE SOME RACKET, HUH?

28:30.009 --> 28:32.311
BUT THE DECORATIONS
ARE STUNNING.
 (water running loudly)

28:32.311 --> 28:34.483
ESPECIALLY
THAT WATERFALL EFFECT.

28:34.483 --> 28:37.246
GABY?
 BREE!

28:37.246 --> 28:39.348
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
IN THE KITCHEN?

28:42.291 --> 28:46.796
DON'T MOVE, HONEY.
THE PRESS IS TAKING YOUR PHOTO.

28:46.796 --> 28:51.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU WERE DISINVITED.
 I GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.003
WE DUCK INSIDE, MAKE SURE WE'RE
SEEN BY ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE--

28:54.003 --> 28:55.464
EXCEPT MRS. DOWNING--

28:55.464 --> 28:58.307
AND THEN AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES,
WE CUT OUT.

28:58.307 --> 29:01.040
WELL, I KNOW NOTHING.
JUST KEEP ME OUT OF IT.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.243
WHAT IS CARLOS DOING?

29:06.245 --> 29:09.118
(sighs)

29:16.355 --> 29:18.357
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

29:18.357 --> 29:20.790
WHERE IS HE?
 WHERE IS WHO?

29:20.790 --> 29:22.932
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW--
JACKSON.

29:22.932 --> 29:25.094
WELL, HE'S NOT HERE.

29:25.094 --> 29:27.266
REALLY? WHOSE IS THIS?

29:27.266 --> 29:30.039
I... D--I DON'T KNOW.
SOME GUY'S.

29:30.039 --> 29:32.371
"I... I DON'T KNOW"?

29:32.371 --> 29:34.543
WELL,
I HOPE THAT "SOME GUY"

29:34.543 --> 29:37.446
DOESN'T MIND THIS.

29:37.446 --> 29:39.909
NO, SUSAN, REALLY,
I WOULDN'T...

29:39.909 --> 29:43.082
LADY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO MY BEER?

29:43.082 --> 29:45.454
WE'RE NOT MARRIED ANYMORE,

29:45.454 --> 29:48.557
SO I DON'T HAVE
TO PROTECT YOU.

29:48.557 --> 29:52.421
I AM... SO SORRY.

29:52.421 --> 29:53.923
MISS?

29:53.923 --> 29:56.365
UM... COULD YOU JUST...

29:56.365 --> 29:59.298
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE
OF MY FRIEND?

30:02.231 --> 30:04.233
JACKSON CANCELED ON ME.

30:04.233 --> 30:07.136
HE SAID YOU WEREN'T COMFORTABLE
WITH US HANGING OUT.

30:07.136 --> 30:10.279
HE SAID THAT?
 AND I THINK I SAID, "MEOW."
(imitates whip cracking)

30:10.279 --> 30:12.982
(sighs deeply)
I AM SUCH A JACKASS.

30:12.982 --> 30:15.344
SO WHY DON'T YOU WANT US
HANGING OUT?

30:15.344 --> 30:17.346
WELL, I WAS
PRETTY TICKED OFF

30:17.346 --> 30:20.219
THAT YOU TOLD JACKSON
ABOUT THE EAR THING.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.222
OH, GOD. THE SECOND I SAID THAT,
I WISHED I HADN'T.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.054
I-I'M REALLY SORRY.

30:25.054 --> 30:26.825
(sighs)

30:26.825 --> 30:29.959
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

30:29.959 --> 30:33.162
SO IF I PROMISE TO BEHAVE,
CAN WE STILL HANG OUT?

30:33.162 --> 30:35.364
'CAUSE I REALLY THINK
IT'D BE GOOD FOR M.J.,

30:35.364 --> 30:37.566
JUST SEEING THAT
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS.

30:37.566 --> 30:39.138
I DON'T...

30:39.138 --> 30:40.609
WHAT?

30:40.609 --> 30:42.471
I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE

30:42.471 --> 30:44.843
WITH YOU AND JACKSON
GETTING THAT CLOSE.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.116
OKAY.

30:47.116 --> 30:50.980
IT'S JUST... (sighs)

30:50.980 --> 30:54.523
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO SEE ME THROUGH YOUR EYES.

30:54.523 --> 30:57.386
HOW EXACTLY
DO YOU THINK I SEE YOU?

30:57.386 --> 31:01.490
WELL, THOSE LAST FEW MONTHS
WE WERE TOGETHER, I...

31:01.490 --> 31:04.633
THE THINGS I SAID TO YOU,
THE WAY I ACTED...

31:04.633 --> 31:07.636
I MEAN, I'M NOT PROUD
OF THE PERSON I BECAME.

31:07.636 --> 31:11.300
THAT WAS A BAD TIME, SUSAN.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.343
WE'RE NOT THOSE PEOPLE
ANYMORE.

31:14.343 --> 31:17.076
AND IF YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF
THROUGH MY EYES,

31:17.076 --> 31:19.478
YOU'D KNOW YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.484
(mouths words)

31:25.484 --> 31:28.187
COULD YOU PLEASE
TAKE CARE OF THIS GUY?

31:30.389 --> 31:33.462
HE'S MY FRIEND, TOO.

31:50.339 --> 31:52.381
BOY, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU.

31:52.381 --> 31:54.043
WHERE YOU BEEN?

31:54.043 --> 31:58.117
OUT,
UH, DOING SOME THINKING.

31:58.117 --> 32:01.320
AND I'VE DECIDED THAT I MAY
HAVE GONE A LITTLE OVERBOARD

32:01.320 --> 32:02.992
ABOUT YOU AND MIKE.

32:02.992 --> 32:07.396
IN FACT, I THINK IT'S COOL IF
YOU WANNA HANG OUT WITH MY EX.

32:07.396 --> 32:09.498
HEY, SUSIE Q.!

32:09.498 --> 32:12.331
JUST SHAKIN' THE DEW
OFF THE LILY.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.432
AND SPEAKING OF,

32:13.432 --> 32:17.066
THAT PAINT JOB IN THE GUEST CAN
IS NICE. KUDOS.

32:17.066 --> 32:19.308
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:19.308 --> 32:23.142
WELL, JULIE NEEDED ME TO COSIGN
SOME INSURANCE STUFF FOR HER,

32:23.142 --> 32:27.176
AND I GUESS I LOST TRACK OF TIME
TALKING TO CRUNCHY GRANOLA HERE.

32:27.176 --> 32:30.479
PLUMBER TO HOUSEPAINTER
IN ONE MOVE, SUSIE?

32:30.479 --> 32:33.452
DON'T GET DIZZY CLIMBIN'
THAT SOCIAL LADDER. (laughs)

32:33.452 --> 32:36.255
CAN YOU LEAVE, PLEASE?
 JUST THINK...

32:36.255 --> 32:40.459
IF I'D BEEN A ROOFER, WE MIGHT
STILL BE TOGETHER. SIGH.
 GET OUT.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.391
SEE YA AROUND, HACKY SACK.

32:42.391 --> 32:44.163
(front door shuts)

32:47.536 --> 32:51.200
SO... ANY MORE EXES
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

32:55.304 --> 32:57.106
(indistinct conversations)

32:57.106 --> 32:59.108
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE
MICHELLE'S PARTIES?

32:59.108 --> 33:01.180
OH, THEY ARE FUN.
 MM-HMM.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.353
BUT I ENJOY MY INTIMATE LUNCHES
WITH MICHELLE EVEN MORE.

33:04.353 --> 33:08.187
WE HAVE INTIMATE LUNCHES.
WE'RE FRIENDS.
 WELL, YOU SIMPLY MUST COME

33:08.187 --> 33:10.519
TO THE CHARITY AUCTION
AT TED'S GALLERY NEXT WEEKEND.

33:10.519 --> 33:13.492
REALLY? WE'D LOVE TO.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.724
(laughs)
 (clink)

33:15.724 --> 33:17.396
GABY!

33:17.396 --> 33:20.529
WELL, IT'S THE CATERER!
(chuckles)

33:20.529 --> 33:22.371
EVERYTHING IS FABULOUS.

33:22.371 --> 33:25.374
BUT WOULD YOU BE A DEAR
AND GET ME SOME MORE WINE?
 I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.

33:25.374 --> 33:28.507
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
IT'S THE KIND YOU LIKE.
 (grunts)

33:32.441 --> 33:34.483
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

33:34.483 --> 33:37.486
DINNER IS ABOUT TO BE SERVED.
WHOSE SEATS ARE YOU IN?
 THE BOWMANS.

33:37.486 --> 33:41.420
I FOUND OUT MRS. BOWMAN
IS HOME WITH THE FLU. SCORE!

33:41.420 --> 33:44.253
OH, WILL YOU UNCLENCH?
IT'LL BE FINE.

33:44.253 --> 33:47.696
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THESE ARE
MY SEATS. THIS IS MY MOTHER.

33:47.696 --> 33:49.698
THAT WAS MR. BOWMAN,
WASN'T IT?

33:49.698 --> 33:51.700
YES, AND I'M PRETTY SURE

33:51.700 --> 33:53.702
THAT ELDERLY WOMAN WITH HIM
WAS HIS MOTHER!

33:53.702 --> 33:56.405
WHAT KIND OF MAN
LEAVES HIS SICK WIFE AT HOME

33:56.405 --> 33:59.408
TO GO PARTY WITH MOMMY?!
 YOU CAN FIX THIS. JUST TELL THEM
THAT YOU'RE AT THE WRONG TABLE

33:59.408 --> 34:01.470
AND THEN SLIP OUT
THE SIDE DOOR.
 RIGHT.

34:01.470 --> 34:03.772
YES, SIR, HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO--
 THAT WAS THE MAîTRE D',
WASN'T IT?

34:03.772 --> 34:06.775
YES, AND HE APPEARS TO BE
CHECKING THE GUEST LIST.
 WHICH WE'RE NOT ON.

34:06.775 --> 34:08.476
OKAY, YOU CAN FIX THIS.

34:08.476 --> 34:10.478
JUST EXPLAIN YOU'RE
GOING TO A DIFFERENT PARTY

34:10.478 --> 34:12.481
HERE AT THE CLUB
AND THAT YOU GOT CONFUSED.

34:12.481 --> 34:14.783
MRS. DOWNING
NEVER HAS TO KNOW.
 RIGHT.

34:14.783 --> 34:16.784
YOU NEED TO LEAVE! OUT.

34:16.784 --> 34:19.828
(sighs)
 THAT'S MRS. DOWNING.
HOW AM I GONNA FIX THIS?

34:19.828 --> 34:23.462
AT THIS POINT, I WOULD JUST RUN
OFF SCREAMING INTO THE NIGHT.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.464
THANK YOU.
 MM-HMM.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.065
(grunts)
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

34:28.065 --> 34:32.440
GABY! GABY!

34:32.440 --> 34:34.743
POOR BLIND BASTARD.
 (sighs deeply)

34:34.743 --> 34:36.745
I'LL MEET HIM OUTSIDE.

34:38.706 --> 34:41.710
(dog barking in distance)

34:44.183 --> 34:46.114
WHAT?
 HI, EDIE.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.460
I JUST WANTED TO SAY I FEEL
AWFUL ABOUT WHAT I SAID TO YOU.

34:52.460 --> 34:55.724
YOU KNOW, THAT CRACK I MADE
THE OTHER DAY?

34:55.724 --> 34:58.467
OKAY.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.129
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

35:01.870 --> 35:04.173
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

35:04.173 --> 35:07.436
ACTUALLY, NO.
MY CAT'S MISSING.

35:07.436 --> 35:08.877
TOBY?
 MM-HMM.

35:08.877 --> 35:12.511
SINCE WHEN?
 IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS, AND HE'S
NEVER BEEN OUT THIS LONG.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.112
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.544
I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

35:15.544 --> 35:18.387
YEAH. WELL...

35:18.387 --> 35:20.419
COULD YOU TELL DAVE...

35:20.419 --> 35:23.892
TELL HIM I APOLOGIZED? AND, UH,
YOU AND I ARE GOOD, HUH?

35:25.454 --> 35:28.197
I GUESS I COULD.
WHY DO YOU WANT HIM--

35:28.197 --> 35:30.459
OH, JUST TELL HIM, PLEASE.

35:37.406 --> 35:40.409
(engine starts)
 I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU PULLED A STUNT LIKE THAT.

35:40.409 --> 35:41.870
WHAT?

35:41.870 --> 35:44.873
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SALVAGE
WHAT'S LEFT OF OUR SOCIAL LIFE.

35:44.873 --> 35:46.875
NOW JUST LET IT GO

35:46.875 --> 35:49.348
AND START THINKING ABOUT
WHERE WE'RE GONNA MOVE.

35:49.348 --> 35:52.351
THIS IS NOT A JOKE, GABY.
I WORK WITH THESE PEOPLE.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.423
I HAVE TO SHOW MY FACE TOMORROW.
IT'S HUMILIATING.

35:54.423 --> 35:56.285
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S HUMILIATING?

35:56.285 --> 35:57.586
WAKING UP ONE DAY

35:57.586 --> 35:59.588
AND FINDING OUT
YOU'RE INVISIBLE.

35:59.588 --> 36:01.590
NOW IT'S OFFICIAL.
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

36:01.590 --> 36:03.292
EVERYTHING?

36:03.292 --> 36:05.434
FIRST OUR MONEY,
THEN MY FIGURE,

36:05.434 --> 36:09.438
NOW THE LAST SHREDS
OF OUR SOCIAL STANDING.

36:09.438 --> 36:11.440
WE HAVEN'T LOST A THING

36:11.440 --> 36:14.873
EXCEPT THE CHANCE TO HOBNOB
WITH A BUNCH OF UNHAPPY SNOBS.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.476
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THEY'RE UNHAPPY?

36:17.476 --> 36:20.479
THEY'RE RICH!
THEY HAVE JEWELS AND COOKS.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.951
THEY USE "WINTER" AS A VERB.

36:22.951 --> 36:24.883
I RUB THEM, GABY,

36:24.883 --> 36:26.585
AND THERE IS NOTHING

36:26.585 --> 36:28.717
THAT A BLIND MASSEUR
DOESN'T HEAR ABOUT.

36:28.717 --> 36:30.919
TRUST ME.

36:30.919 --> 36:33.422
THEY ARE EVERY BIT
AS MISERABLE AS I WAS

36:33.422 --> 36:37.466
WHEN I WAS OUT THERE
CHASING THAT STUFF.

36:40.369 --> 36:44.233
WE HAVE LOST NOTHING
THAT MATTERS.

36:44.233 --> 36:46.835
WE HAVE A HOME,
WE HAVE EACH OTHER,

36:46.835 --> 36:48.837
WE HAVE WORK
THAT SUPPORTS US,

36:48.837 --> 36:52.941
AND WE HAVE TWO
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRLS THAT...

36:52.941 --> 36:55.314
LOVE US
MORE THAN ICE CREAM.

36:57.646 --> 37:01.420
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER
IN MY LIFE.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.592
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

37:03.592 --> 37:04.893
(laughs) YES,

37:04.893 --> 37:07.596
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER

37:07.596 --> 37:10.729
IS FOR YOU TO REALIZE
HOW GOOD WE'VE GOT IT.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.707
(kisses)

37:18.707 --> 37:21.310
"I HAVE NEVER TALKED
TO SUCH A WONDERFUL GUY,

37:21.310 --> 37:23.472
BUT I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
I'M ALREADY SEEING SOMEBODY..."

37:23.472 --> 37:25.474
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...

37:25.474 --> 37:28.477
"CONTINUE TO TRUST YOUR HEART,
AND YOUR DREAMS WILL FOLLOW."

37:28.477 --> 37:30.549
WOW, LYNETTE.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.522
BEST DEAR JOHN LETTER EVER.

37:33.522 --> 37:35.524
UH... THANKS.
 (clicks key, alert chimes)

37:35.524 --> 37:37.526
EXCEPT YOU MIGHT WANNA
CHANGE THAT PART

37:37.526 --> 37:40.559
WHERE YOU SIGNED IT
"LOVE, MOM."
 WHAT? NO I DIDN'T.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.291
YEAH, YOU DID...

37:42.291 --> 37:44.463
RIGHT THERE.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.465
(gasps)
 YOU SENT IT?!

37:46.465 --> 37:48.537
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

37:48.537 --> 37:50.539
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

37:50.539 --> 37:52.541
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?!
 I DID!

37:52.541 --> 37:55.504
YOU SAID IT WAS GREAT.
WAY TO BURY THE LEAD, TOM!

37:55.504 --> 37:58.407
(door slams)

37:58.407 --> 38:02.411
TOM, DON'T YOU DARE!
 HEY, ONE OF NEEDS TO LIVE
TO TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER ONE.

38:02.411 --> 38:04.413
OH!

38:04.413 --> 38:06.355
(whispers) OH, GOD.

38:18.627 --> 38:20.869
(sighs deeply)

38:29.778 --> 38:31.309
HEY.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.515
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

38:38.687 --> 38:41.950
OKAY,
I KNOW WHAT I DID...

38:41.950 --> 38:43.622
WAS UNFORGIVABLE.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.925
AND I AM NOT TRYING
TO MAKE EXCUSES,

38:46.925 --> 38:48.857
BUT... (sighs)

38:48.857 --> 38:50.859
WE USED TO TALK
ALL THE TIME,

38:50.859 --> 38:53.632
AND THEN ONE DAY
IT JUST STOPPED,

38:53.632 --> 38:56.505
AND IT KILLED ME.

38:56.505 --> 38:59.538
I FELT LIKE I LOST YOU.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.611
AND THEN I WAS SaraJ,
AND I HAD YOU BACK,

39:02.611 --> 39:06.014
AND WE WERE TALKING AGAIN,
AND YOU WERE TELLING ME THINGS.

39:06.014 --> 39:08.016
I WASN'T TELLING YOU
 ANYTHING.

39:08.016 --> 39:09.748
I WAS TELLING HER.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.081
OKAY.

39:20.088 --> 39:22.991
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

39:22.991 --> 39:24.993
I LOVED OUR CONVERSATIONS,

39:24.993 --> 39:28.537
AND I'M... (voice breaks)
GOING TO MISS THEM.

39:35.143 --> 39:36.975
ME, TOO. (sighs deeply)

39:44.583 --> 39:46.715
ORSON, YOU'RE STILL UP.

39:46.715 --> 39:49.418
OH, I WISH
YOU COULD'VE BEEN THERE.

39:49.418 --> 39:51.420
LINDA FLANAGAN
LOVED MY FOOD.

39:51.420 --> 39:53.892
SHE SAID I WAS
"GOD'S GIFT TO THE TABLE"

39:53.892 --> 39:56.895
AND THAT I COULD QUOTE HER
ON THE BOOK JACKET.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.597
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:58.597 --> 40:00.398
I'M HUNGRY.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.531
IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT.
HAVEN'T YOU EATEN?

40:02.531 --> 40:06.435
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU. YOU SAID
YOU'D MAKE ME POT ROAST.

40:06.435 --> 40:09.438
I AM SO SORRY.
I-I LOST ALL TRACK OF TIME,

40:09.438 --> 40:11.740
AND LINDA HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE FOOD.

40:11.740 --> 40:15.113
I'LL MAKE YOU THAT POT ROAST
TOMORROW, OKAY?
 NO.

40:17.646 --> 40:20.619
I WANT IT NOW.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.651
NOW?

40:22.651 --> 40:24.993
YOU PROMISED.

40:26.695 --> 40:28.797
ORSON, I'VE BEEN
COOKING ALL DAY.

40:28.797 --> 40:31.500
I... I'M SO TIRED,
I CAN BARELY STAND UP.

40:31.500 --> 40:35.564
YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO MAKE YOU A POT ROAST NOW?

40:35.564 --> 40:38.767
YOU PROMISED.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.773
(chopping continues)

41:26.054 --> 41:28.256
(door creaks)

41:28.256 --> 41:31.259
TOBY!

41:31.259 --> 41:35.764
WHERE IN THE WORLD
DID YOU COME FROM, HUH?
 (meows)

41:37.666 --> 41:39.668
(wind blowing)

41:43.702 --> 41:46.705
(door creaks)

41:49.838 --> 41:54.843
YES, EVERYONE APPRECIATES
A GOOD NEIGHBOR...
 (whimpers)

41:56.685 --> 42:01.990
YOU KNOW, THE KIND THAT
HELPS YOU WITH THE GROCERIES...

42:01.990 --> 42:06.124
BUT DOESN'T ASK,
"WHY IS YOUR SON SO MOODY?"

42:06.124 --> 42:07.756
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

42:07.756 --> 42:11.700
THE TYPE THAT DELIVERS
MISPLACED MAIL

42:11.700 --> 42:16.164
BUT DOESN'T POINT OUT
YOUR WIFE SEEMS DISCONTENTED...

42:19.037 --> 42:22.540
THE SORT THAT OFFERS
TO MOW YOUR LAWN...

42:22.540 --> 42:27.716
BUT DOESN'T MENTION
YOUR HUSBAND SEEMS COLD.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.550
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SURE
THE MAN NEXT DOOR

42:32.550 --> 42:35.584
IS AS NICE
AS HE WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE...

42:35.584 --> 42:37.886
NOW WHY WOULD YOU
BRING ME FLOWERS?

42:37.886 --> 42:39.888
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT
A COMPUTER,

42:39.888 --> 42:42.891
AND I NEED TO FIND OUT
SOME STUFF ABOUT EDIE'S HUSBAND.

42:42.891 --> 42:47.666
DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO GET TO KNOW HIM BETTER.
