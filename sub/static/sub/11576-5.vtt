WEBVTT

00:06.299 --> 00:10.292
Your blood has spoken.
You have chosen a side.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.045
What side?

00:11.262 --> 00:13.093
You are Dark.

00:13.306 --> 00:15.092
Bull-shit.

00:15.308 --> 00:17.424
There's no freaking
way I'm Dark Fae.

00:17.643 --> 00:20.134
Bo. Succubus. Unaligned.
It's kinda my brand.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.185
Our gargoyle read your blood.

00:22.398 --> 00:23.433
You have joined the Dark.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.264
Funny, you'd think I'd remember

00:25.484 --> 00:27.440
betraying everything
that I've ever stood for.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.065
A mystery for you, Youngling.

00:30.281 --> 00:33.023
And he who led the
Dark during your absence.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.072
Vex?

00:34.285 --> 00:36.025
We, however, are satisfied.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.736
You may take your leave.

00:38.956 --> 00:42.198
Oh, may I?

00:42.418 --> 00:45.535
Buddy, this is my town.

00:45.755 --> 00:47.370
If anyone's taking a leave,

00:47.590 --> 00:49.876
it's you and your
circle-jerk of doom...

00:50.092 --> 00:53.175
And if you see the human doctor
or that terrorist pet of yours.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.003
Tell them we
will see them soon.

00:57.308 --> 00:58.388
What did you say?

00:58.601 --> 01:00.057
They are enemies of the Fae.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.477
Their deaths will
be most painful.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.429
And there it is.

01:17.370 --> 01:21.830
(gasping)

01:22.041 --> 01:23.872
What kind of boomerang
bitch are you?

01:24.085 --> 01:27.498
Strike at the Una Mens and
you shall be your own victim.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.921
For now, aligned
Succubus, a choice:

01:31.133 --> 01:35.092
Pay fealty to the leader of
the Dark at once... or die.

01:59.078 --> 02:00.739
Are you adequately juiced?

02:00.955 --> 02:03.367
Those Una Mens assholes
pack quite a wallop.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.118
And with Dyson out of town,
I gotta find some way

02:05.334 --> 02:07.620
to recharge the double Ds.

02:09.755 --> 02:10.414
The batteries.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.666
My batteries.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.213
Anyway, I just want
to find the Wanderer and

02:13.426 --> 02:14.586
get all this cleared up.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.167
You think the Wanderer's
responsible for the ol'

02:16.387 --> 02:18.673
"whoops | tripped and
accidentally joined club evil?"

02:18.889 --> 02:19.844
Has to be.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.718
He takes me against my
will, he wipes my memory,

02:21.934 --> 02:23.890
and when I come
home I'm Dark Fae?

02:24.103 --> 02:26.640
And I'll tell you who else
is tied up in all this--

02:26.856 --> 02:27.720
Vex-meister General?

02:27.940 --> 02:29.180
Una Mens says he's
deep in da bullcacky.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.391
He is the new leader
of Los Dark Douchebags.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.601
Yeah but we were such
good mascara buddies.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.153
Although he did send Clio
to kinda scalp you, so--

02:36.365 --> 02:37.445
Well, I'm gonna put the
boots to Vex until he

02:37.658 --> 02:40.195
tells me where the Wanderer
is and howl kill him.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.901
Wait up, Dyson, is still um...

02:42.121 --> 02:43.611
Looking for Lauren, yeah.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.661
Glad to see your love life

02:44.874 --> 02:45.989
finally got less complicated.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.038
He has to find her.

02:47.251 --> 02:47.751
He will.

02:47.960 --> 02:48.790
And she has to be okay.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.413
She will.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.583
I love you, Sassafraz.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.505
I know.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.918
Now serving 69!

03:05.978 --> 03:07.764
No duh.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.016
Oh, look, If you're Dark,
does that mean I'm Dark too?

03:10.232 --> 03:12.359
Cuz I'm gonna need like,
a serious image upgrade.

03:12.568 --> 03:13.603
We should talk
clothing allowance...

03:13.819 --> 03:14.524
Oh trust me.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.693
We will not be Dark for long.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.573
(clears throat)
Now serving 69.

03:20.785 --> 03:21.865
Right.

03:22.078 --> 03:23.784
Now serving 69.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.493
l'm dark?

03:34.340 --> 03:39.585
Bo! I am so glad you
could finally join us.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.349
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are

03:51.565 --> 03:54.307
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

03:54.527 --> 03:57.234
My love carries
a death sentence.

03:57.446 --> 04:02.361
I was lost for years...
Searching, while hiding.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.569
Only to find that l belonged
to a world hidden from humans.

04:06.789 --> 04:08.279
I won 't hide anymore.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.706
I will live the life I choose.

04:17.383 --> 04:18.998
I thought you were dead.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.549
Surprise!

04:20.761 --> 04:23.548
And colour me
shocked. Imagine,

04:23.764 --> 04:26.722
the unaligned Succubus
finally yanking her head from

04:26.934 --> 04:29.300
between her shapely
legs and coming over

04:29.520 --> 04:31.181
to the only side that matters.

04:31.397 --> 04:32.978
Well it wasn't
by choice, lady.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.181
And I'm having it annulled,
as soon as you give me Vex.

04:35.401 --> 04:36.311
Vex?

04:36.527 --> 04:37.858
Since when is
that pervert capable

04:38.070 --> 04:39.355
of anything above the belt.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.188
He imprisoned
your brassy beaver.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.357
Right. Vex-- Vex bad.

04:45.578 --> 04:46.408
Vex mesmer poop.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.996
Sweetie, if it's Vex you want,

04:48.205 --> 04:49.866
come to my dark
ceilidh this aft.

04:50.082 --> 04:50.946
Dark kale-y?

04:51.167 --> 04:52.657
What is that code
for vegetable enema.

04:52.877 --> 04:56.369
A dark ceilidh is like a Light
Fae party except with more...

04:56.589 --> 04:57.294
everything!

04:57.506 --> 04:59.087
Everything except a succubus.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.666
Thanks, but I'll catch
up to Vex on my own.

05:01.886 --> 05:04.218
Look, if you were hoodwinked
into joining the Dark,

05:04.430 --> 05:06.716
you can get out of it
simply by showing proof.

05:06.932 --> 05:07.842
ReaHy?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.309
The bad news is
you have to show proof

05:09.518 --> 05:11.600
before the first
full moon since you joined.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.517
That's tonight.

05:12.730 --> 05:13.640
Oh, right.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.346
Well, no time to
dawdle then, is there?

05:15.566 --> 05:17.147
Feel free to bring
your human pet.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.565
I'm not a pet.

05:18.777 --> 05:22.520
I will never be anyone's
pet, nor will any human.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.777
See? Already getting
the hang of being Dark.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.982
ReaHy?

05:27.203 --> 05:28.534
I mean, shut up.

05:28.746 --> 05:30.702
Show up in whatever
makes you comfortable.

05:30.915 --> 05:34.453
Though there is one thing

05:34.668 --> 05:36.659
that you might consider
wearing for once.

05:36.879 --> 05:37.994
What's that?

05:38.214 --> 05:39.829
A smile.

05:41.884 --> 05:42.839
Oh brother.

05:48.307 --> 05:51.640
Just get me something,
anything on this Wanderer,

05:51.852 --> 05:54.013
Wai Lin, and we'll do dinner.

05:54.230 --> 05:56.767
Just dinner.

06:24.677 --> 06:28.761
(door closing)

06:34.270 --> 06:37.228
How dare you enter my private
quarters without invitation.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.566
That is a big knife
for a bartender.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.390
Depends on the bar.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.232
You've been summoned
by the Una Mens

06:45.447 --> 06:47.984
for a personal inquisition.

06:50.703 --> 06:53.866
So get your story straight.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.582
Which story?

06:55.791 --> 06:57.406
Your life story.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.222
Wow!

07:14.810 --> 07:17.142
You said Dark Fae, right?

07:17.354 --> 07:20.846
"Please plant a tree
in honour of our future"

07:21.066 --> 07:22.101
Tree huggers? Bad swag?

07:22.318 --> 07:23.603
Not a UFC fighter in sight?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.526
This is the worst Dark Fae
party we have ever been to.

07:26.739 --> 07:28.946
This is the only Dark Fae
party we've ever been to.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.273
And the only one
we're ever going to.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.484
Well then, | best embrace
my bad-girl. 'Scuse me.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.203
Dark side for life!

07:37.416 --> 07:39.122
(coughing) Again!

07:39.335 --> 07:40.950
Okay well, swizzlesticks
do not let them

07:41.170 --> 07:42.751
poke out your eye. Come here--

07:42.963 --> 07:47.047
There she is,
the guest of honor!

07:47.259 --> 07:49.375
Look at you,
all edgy and shit.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.460
You sure know how
to grab the spotlight.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.841
Have you tried the buffet?

07:54.058 --> 07:56.595
There is something
for everyone...

07:56.810 --> 07:58.641
A human buffet?

07:58.854 --> 08:00.594
I bet this one
starts with vanilla

08:00.814 --> 08:03.851
and has a long, smoky finish.

08:07.780 --> 08:10.738
Leave here at once. And
take your friends with you.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.535
Dismissing the food?
Kind of gauche, no?

08:16.747 --> 08:18.578
That's why there's
no way I'm Dark.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.702
Please. We're no
different than the Light.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.000
Did I get judgey
on you just now? Yes!

08:23.212 --> 08:24.952
But I'm already over it.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.582
My day is saved.

08:26.799 --> 08:29.632
Because there is a refreshing
lack of hypocrisy with us.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.095
We're honest
about what we are, Bo.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.544
So why aren't you?

08:33.764 --> 08:35.129
I know who I am.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.509
You're a luscious
succubus who--

08:36.725 --> 08:39.558
whose true nature is
to feed off of humans.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.010
Like the rest of us Fae.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.515
You just choose not to.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.232
Lame, but whatevs.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.306
You've got great hair.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.483
Is that why everyone's
looking at me?

08:48.696 --> 08:52.188
They're delighted that
you've found your true home.

08:52.408 --> 08:54.364
They're happy for you.

08:56.662 --> 08:59.529
The Dark Fae is not my
home, and I'm not here to

08:59.748 --> 09:01.830
make you look good in
front of your subjects.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.533
| just want to ask Vex howl
ended up pledged to you goons.

09:04.753 --> 09:05.378
So where is he?

09:05.587 --> 09:06.667
Oh, somewhere.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.337
I don't know. You're
gonna have to look for him.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.630
You said he would be here.

09:10.843 --> 09:14.552
No, I said if you wanted him,
you'd have to come to the party.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.345
Now that you're here, I'm
gonna give you every resource

09:17.558 --> 09:19.389
in order for you
to hunt him down.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.728
Well I think I'll just collect
my gift bag and be on my way.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.223
The Una Mens is
cramping my style,

09:24.440 --> 09:28.183
and they want every human
that you love very, very dead.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.358
I can protect my friends.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.856
Una Mens won't
leave town until

09:32.072 --> 09:33.357
all loose ends are tied up.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.610
And Vex is the
loosest end of all.

09:35.826 --> 09:36.781
Why is that?

09:36.994 --> 09:40.236
Cause he's vanished and
somehow pissed them off.

09:40.456 --> 09:41.536
I need to find him.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.580
And apparently you
need to find him too.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.747
I'd call that kismet.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.201
I'd call it kiss my
ass while I walk away

09:47.421 --> 09:48.786
and do this on my own terms.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.121
You're Dark now, Bo.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.467
That means I'm
not only your boss,

09:52.676 --> 09:54.632
but I'm your friend.

09:54.845 --> 09:58.463
And I want to prove to you
how good of a friend I can be.

10:44.102 --> 10:49.563
We call to order the inquisition
of Fitzpatrick McCorrigan.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.858
The results will
carry great weight

10:54.071 --> 10:56.858
in determining your future.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.530
Have you brought a second?

10:58.742 --> 11:01.609
I take care of my own affairs.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.286
So be it.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.160
How did you come to
be here in the colonies?

11:07.376 --> 11:10.334
Would you believe I took
a wrong turn at Morocco?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.290
Well I guess we have
a lot to talk about.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.466
Yeah, I guess we should.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.515
Oh boy...

11:25.727 --> 11:26.591
This dress is incredible.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.143
Let's get you out of it.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.686
Stat.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.014
Oh, doctor talk!

11:33.193 --> 11:35.184
Um... Mini quiche?

11:35.404 --> 11:37.315
Get out.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.487
Uh you kn-know m-maybe
just leave the tray.

11:49.835 --> 11:53.794
A humble Lakin Chan opens a
bar and gains some prominence.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.337
People do enjoy a stiff drink.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.666
The Dal Riata was declared
a place of sanctuary.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.593
|t gained you influence
with the Light and the Dark.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.966
I keep my nose
out of Fae politics.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.924
You must know how
the Una Mens came to be.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.601
After the Great Fae War,
there was a rebellion.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.724
Fae rebels trying
to overturn the blood

12:11.940 --> 12:14.727
laws of the Blood King.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.558
Why was that?

12:17.613 --> 12:19.353
He became corrupt.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.360
But a peace was offered, if
The King would relinquish power

12:22.576 --> 12:25.409
to a council made up of
those willing to sacrifice

12:25.621 --> 12:28.328
their individual
flaws and desires.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.165
And souls.

12:29.374 --> 12:33.993
To form a single soul
without ego or ambition.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.501
The Blood King agreed.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.708
Then he betrayed us.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.098
The six seeds of the
sacred papyrus plant

12:48.310 --> 12:50.767
were given to
six Fae to swallow.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.015
So they might be
blessed with new life

12:53.231 --> 12:57.099
as a single vessel
of humility and justice.

12:57.319 --> 13:01.187
The King stole his
seed and vanished.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.193
Absorb the power of the
blood mage and the Una Mens

13:04.409 --> 13:09.529
will be able to enforce the
laws he wrote, unchallenged.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.409
Unchallenged?

13:11.625 --> 13:15.163
We would have him take
his rightful place among us.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.995
If we might find him.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.926
You said there'd be dancing.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.629
Why do you think we're
carbo loading, Footloose?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.385
These people
don't seem so bad.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.933
What's the difference
between Light and Dark anyway?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.180
Well the Light are assholes.

13:33.397 --> 13:38.266
And the Dark... are
assholes who have fun.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.600
Sushﬂ

13:39.820 --> 13:43.187
Mmmm, spicy salmon roll.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.193
Hi, Kenzi.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.741
Bruce?

13:47.953 --> 13:49.739
Bruce I thought you
were in Bora Bora.

13:49.955 --> 13:52.367
I really didn't want
you to see me like this.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.867
Oh my god, you're
a living sushi table!

13:54.084 --> 13:56.370
You're... Brushi!

13:56.586 --> 13:58.167
Oooh, special sauce!

13:58.380 --> 13:59.836
Hey! No dragon roll for you!

14:00.048 --> 14:01.208
Bruce get up.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.710
But this is my punishment...

14:02.926 --> 14:04.541
Get up, Bruce.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.682
Oh, good lord. Okay.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.891
Okay. We're gonna get
this... ginger off you,

14:13.103 --> 14:17.062
find you a shirt and
some dignity to go with it.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.816
Vera Wang!

14:24.906 --> 14:26.362
Oh no.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.908
What. Is. Happening?!

14:31.121 --> 14:32.486
You didn't think
the Dark legitimately

14:32.706 --> 14:34.822
paid for stuff
like this, did you?!

14:35.042 --> 14:37.203
Okay. Bad sushi everyone!

14:37.419 --> 14:40.252
They read their vows in
iambic pentameter. So lovely.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.420
Move it, people!

14:48.221 --> 14:50.382
We really do have
a lot to talk about...

14:50.599 --> 14:53.136
We should do that sometime.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.683
I wanted to find you.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.808
I had to go...

14:59.024 --> 15:02.516
Bo, I am just so
glad that you're here.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.647
Why are you here?

15:04.863 --> 15:09.072
Vex somehow worked with the
Wanderer to turn me Dark.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.899
You're Dark?

15:11.119 --> 15:13.986
|just-- I came here
to find Vex to reverse it.

15:14.206 --> 15:17.198
And | just never imagined...

15:17.417 --> 15:19.373
God, I've been
worried sick about you.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.872
And here you are,
chilling with the Morrigan...

15:22.089 --> 15:25.673
Not chilling so much as hiding
in terror from the Una Mens.

15:25.884 --> 15:26.919
Thanks to the Morrigan.

15:27.135 --> 15:27.999
Oh of course,

15:28.220 --> 15:29.255
I wanna hear what
the hell happened...

15:29.471 --> 15:31.462
And I wanna tell you.

15:31.681 --> 15:35.390
But right now it sounds
like you need to get going.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.558
Oh, in a second.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.264
Booorrr-ing!

15:42.484 --> 15:44.850
What's next, are you gonna
braid each other's hair?

15:45.070 --> 15:46.355
Scissor already!

15:46.571 --> 15:47.606
If we wanted an audience,

15:47.823 --> 15:49.279
we would've charged admission.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.904
Well at this rate, I would
have asked for a refund.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.658
Fine. Back to
business, I suppose.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.329
|'ll-- I'll leave you two...

15:58.542 --> 16:01.284
No, I want you to hear this.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.085
Bo I will give you
the means to run down Vex

16:04.297 --> 16:07.710
if you give me your blood
oath to bring him to me.

16:07.926 --> 16:11.510
Lets hear what
the means is, first.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.803
I am so freaking excited
to be working with you!

16:14.015 --> 16:16.051
Why don't we just
invite the waiter back in?

16:16.268 --> 16:17.849
No no, only those
who need to know.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.141
I guess that makes me...?

16:19.354 --> 16:20.264
Essential.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.061
Bo's gonna need a drug to make

16:22.274 --> 16:25.311
Vex powerless and compliant.

16:25.527 --> 16:29.691
It's gonna need a certain
doctor's, mmm, touch.

16:29.906 --> 16:30.986
So what's the plan?

16:31.199 --> 16:33.190
We're going on a mission!

16:33.410 --> 16:34.490
Evony's Angels!

16:40.000 --> 16:40.864
(sigh)

16:41.084 --> 16:45.168
I'll give you a few moments
to... collect yourselves.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.336
Come along, scavenger.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.759
A few minutes is
not a lot of time.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.590
Waste not, want not.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.850
This is the most amazing day!

17:05.066 --> 17:06.397
It's like a dream come true!

17:06.610 --> 17:08.475
Being on an actual
assignment with Bo,

17:08.695 --> 17:11.562
the insanely hot succubus,
and Lauren the genius doctor!

17:11.781 --> 17:12.907
| get to be part of
something instead ofjust

17:13.116 --> 17:14.617
having to devour sloppy seconds!

17:14.826 --> 17:15.326
Ew.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.240
She's a scavenger Fae.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.317
And | just peed
myself a little.

17:17.537 --> 17:17.912
Wow...

17:18.121 --> 17:19.281
Well, great to have
you on board, Pietra,

17:19.497 --> 17:20.407
but what are we doing here?

17:20.624 --> 17:22.205
Wait. Oh! Right.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.908
I've heard the most totally
shocking things about Vex.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.743
With the Una Mens and
the Morrigan after him,

17:26.963 --> 17:29.500
and all his assets frozen, he's
been sticking to the shadows,

17:29.716 --> 17:30.831
hunted, haunted and broken.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.962
Guess what he's
been doing for cash?

17:33.178 --> 17:35.294
He's hookering!

17:35.513 --> 17:36.343
Do you need help?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.514
Nope, all good.
Just stay right there.

17:43.480 --> 17:48.065
(grunting)

17:59.496 --> 18:00.781
He has been
dying to flee town.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.374
But the Una Mens poison is
binding him to the territory.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.915
That's why he needs this!

18:06.127 --> 18:07.253
The Scimitar of Cronus.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.577
It's the only way
to cut out the poison!

18:08.797 --> 18:10.287
He thinks I'm stealing it for
him in exchange for taking me

18:10.507 --> 18:11.212
with him when he runs

18:11.424 --> 18:13.210
and giving me all
his leftover feeds, but--

18:13.426 --> 18:15.712
(giggles) it's a
total sting operation!

18:15.929 --> 18:17.715
Where are you giving
this blade to Vex?

18:17.931 --> 18:20.013
I don't know yet. But he'll
call me when he's ready.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.011
Well I can't wait for
him to drunk dial you,

18:22.227 --> 18:23.307
I need Vex before moonrise.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.555
Oh my god, I'm failing you,
I'm totally failing you.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.602
No, Pietra,
you're doing great.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.522
Where was the last
place that you saw Vex?

18:29.734 --> 18:32.111
Under the old railway
bridge in the east end.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.527
Well that's by the gym
that Dyson moved into.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.275
Vex is hiding
near his arch enemy?

18:36.491 --> 18:37.651
No one would suspect it.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.903
But we could get
Dyson to sniff him out.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.910
Actually, Dyson is
away... looking for you.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.574
Oh.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.002
Well if Dyson's absent,
that's even better for Vex.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.875
He'll feel completely
safe right now.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.377
But he would still be
hiding. And in that area

18:55.593 --> 18:59.586
any Dark Fae on the street would
attract a lot of attention.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.966
That's right...

19:01.182 --> 19:03.844
Any Dark Fae would
attract attention.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.519
Are you ready for
some real action, Pietra?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.017
Yeah!

19:14.863 --> 19:16.353
Let's do this!

19:18.283 --> 19:19.568
Okay, so as punishment
for helping me,

19:19.784 --> 19:21.570
you were given to
another Fae as property?

19:21.786 --> 19:24.653
I'm a slave of Kai the
Makishi. Kai is really mean.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.454
Yeah but you-- you sent
me all those postcards.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.875
You were clam diving all day
and hula hoop golfing at night.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.873
Hula hoop golf
isn't a thing, is it.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.875
I didn't want you
to worry about me.

19:35.091 --> 19:35.876
Well now I'm worried, Bruce!

19:36.092 --> 19:37.798
Well, we can help you. Right?

19:38.011 --> 19:40.297
Yes, yes we can help you!

19:40.513 --> 19:41.593
How do we help you?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.671
Get another Fae
to master me I guess.

19:43.892 --> 19:44.677
Master you?

19:44.893 --> 19:47.054
It's much worse
than it sounds.

19:47.270 --> 19:47.975
Any Fae?

19:48.188 --> 19:49.394
Yeah.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.097
And does anything bad happen
to someone who Masters you?

19:52.317 --> 19:53.898
They become completely
responsible for me until

19:54.110 --> 19:55.725
my punishment is fulfilled.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.526
I take up a lot of space.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.697
Space is cheap when you're
squatting. Alright, blondie--

20:02.577 --> 20:04.238
Oh yeah.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.528
Underwater sponge gardening?

20:06.748 --> 20:07.533
Not a thing.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.364
I knew it.

20:12.212 --> 20:18.253
Hi everybody, I'm uh--
I'm Tamsin, wooo!

20:18.468 --> 20:22.427
Anyway, I am just
gonna master all over that

20:22.639 --> 20:24.220
big guy Bruce over there!

20:24.432 --> 20:27.139
So uh, Kai, wherever you are,

20:27.352 --> 20:29.889
up yours you big dong-head!

20:33.066 --> 20:36.399
Now it's a party.
A challenge has been made.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.192
The current holder
of the burden has

20:38.405 --> 20:41.989
the right to defend
their property.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.862
Duelists, step forward!

20:45.078 --> 20:46.033
Duelists...?

20:46.246 --> 20:47.861
Totally a thing.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.745
Oh, swizzlesticks.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.226
What's in the needle?

21:16.443 --> 21:18.934
Nectar of violet,
it's extremely rare,

21:19.154 --> 21:20.735
but just so happens
that the Dark Fae have

21:20.947 --> 21:22.858
oodles of it in
their greenhouse.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.986
Can you imagine? Socrates'
natural hallucinogenic?

21:26.202 --> 21:27.817
Mm. Mind blown.

21:28.037 --> 21:28.662
Mm.

21:28.872 --> 21:29.861
So how about that talk?

21:30.081 --> 21:30.536
Talk?

21:30.748 --> 21:31.533
Talk!

21:31.749 --> 21:32.033
Now?

21:32.250 --> 21:34.411
Now! We could
be here a while.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.753
Where do you wanna start?

21:43.970 --> 21:46.256
I dunno. Our break.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.429
What happened at Taft's.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.427
Karen...

21:50.643 --> 21:52.634
Yeah who is this Karen person?

21:52.854 --> 21:55.516
How we came into the
clutches of the Dark Fae...

21:55.732 --> 21:56.517
Back to this Karen.

21:56.733 --> 21:57.267
Hello?

21:57.484 --> 21:58.564
Wait, wa-wa-wait--

21:58.776 --> 22:00.391
Oh, shit!

22:02.697 --> 22:04.733
Of course Vex is too
smart to show himself.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.530
Well he's clearly
controlling that woman.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.404
He has to be here somewhere...

22:08.620 --> 22:10.576
I don't like this...

22:13.500 --> 22:15.411
Ow!

22:15.627 --> 22:17.083
Woman down! Woman down!

22:17.295 --> 22:18.626
Pietra!

22:18.838 --> 22:20.169
I totally got
wounded in action.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.791
This is so awesome.

22:22.008 --> 22:22.838
God, it hurts!

22:23.051 --> 22:23.961
I'm gonna hurt you
if you don't be quiet.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.917
Bo, I got this.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.752
Okay, it's just bruised.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.554
Tell me the truth, doc,
am I gonna lose the leg?

22:30.767 --> 22:33.725
No, but you might lose a
tongue if you don't be quiet.

22:33.937 --> 22:34.517
Call you when I find him!

22:34.729 --> 22:37.812
Bo! You're gonna need this.

22:39.984 --> 22:43.397
For the record? I think
you make a great couple.

23:00.630 --> 23:04.373
Bo, my sultry little suckface!

23:04.592 --> 23:07.584
Since when did you start doing
the Morrigan's dirty work?

23:07.804 --> 23:09.340
Since you and the
Wanderer tricked me

23:09.556 --> 23:10.887
into becoming Dark Fae.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.681
And now you're
going to undo it.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.394
The Wanderer?

23:15.603 --> 23:17.935
That's a tall tale me mum
used to tell me to scare me

23:18.147 --> 23:20.638
from fiddling
with myself in public.

23:20.858 --> 23:24.191
But I haven't got time
for stories about bogeymen.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.988
I'm hitting the road, so it's
sayonara and see you never.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.780
Well I'm sorry to crash
your going away party.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.279
But I've given my blood
oath to haul your boney ass

23:32.495 --> 23:33.450
in to the Morrigan.

23:33.663 --> 23:37.497
Hey. This is a
pole-dancer's ass, this is.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.324
So piss off.

23:39.627 --> 23:43.870
(fighting)

23:44.090 --> 23:46.706
Sorry in advance
about the goose-egg!

23:46.926 --> 23:49.884
(pow! wham!)

23:54.142 --> 23:56.098
Swizzlesticks.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.608
Oh, whoa.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.406
God, what was in that syringe?

24:12.619 --> 24:16.988
Oh yeah... Socrates.

24:17.206 --> 24:21.324
Everything's all... pink.

24:21.544 --> 24:25.253
Why am I here? Dyson?

24:25.465 --> 24:29.708
Oh no sorry, luv, Dyson's
out chasing his own tail.

24:29.927 --> 24:33.419
Which means you and I can,
like, totally hang out.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.050
Let me go...

24:35.266 --> 24:37.552
Oh yeah, by all means.

24:37.769 --> 24:40.761
Oh, what's that,
you can't move?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.596
Well didn't someone
get box-blocked by

24:43.816 --> 24:45.477
their ex's pointy thing.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.184
Oh, look at that,
I made a funny!

24:48.404 --> 24:49.780
No, you made a mistake...

24:49.989 --> 24:51.024
Anyway, you're my leverage.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.652
In case I hit any snags
in getting out of Dodge.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.233
Oh no, no, no, no.
You can't leave...

24:55.453 --> 24:58.536
No, I can and
must, I'm afraid.

24:58.748 --> 25:02.707
After I perform some
necessary surgery.

25:02.919 --> 25:05.001
Ohhh, sharp indeed.

25:05.213 --> 25:09.172
Perfect for slitting a succubus'
soft and lovely throat.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.098
My, my. Not even a spark.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.684
Quite the cocktail
that doctor cooked up.

25:18.893 --> 25:20.258
Lauren...

25:20.478 --> 25:23.311
And... we're back together...

25:23.523 --> 25:25.184
She brought me a
really pretty necklace.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.105
It really was just a break.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.477
If you don't stop gushing,

25:27.694 --> 25:29.104
I swear I'm gonna slit
my own bloody throat.

25:29.320 --> 25:29.945
Wait, yeah!

25:30.154 --> 25:32.270
I'm pissed at you for
making me join the Dark.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.902
They're gross and
they took Lauren and

25:35.118 --> 25:36.358
the moon will be up soon.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.953
And you really need
to tell me how you and

25:38.162 --> 25:41.746
Sir Smokes-a-lot tricked me
so that I can un-join them...

25:41.958 --> 25:44.199
Me! Me! Me! Me!

25:44.419 --> 25:46.159
It's not all
about you, you know.

25:46.379 --> 25:49.086
I swear I can't get out
of this town fast enough.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.913
Agh!

25:57.140 --> 25:58.755
Okay. You're a Valkyrie.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.886
All you need to do
is cast doubt on her,

26:01.102 --> 26:02.763
and then knee
her in the ovaries.

26:02.979 --> 26:04.014
That doesn't sound very nice.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.060
Look you're Dark Fae.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.103
She's Dark Fae.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.270
Everything is allowed.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.269
This fight's gonna
be a bloody slug fest.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.521
I mean, you're gonna be
totally fine, don't worry.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.444
Just protect your face.

26:13.656 --> 26:17.365
Ladies, lords,
and lickspittles!

26:17.577 --> 26:22.412
It's time to commence the
master duel... to the death!

26:25.585 --> 26:29.373
Tails! The challenger gets
to choose the mode of combat.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.578
What'll it be, honey?

26:30.798 --> 26:32.413
Pistols? Swords?

26:32.633 --> 26:34.589
I just wanna dance!

26:36.554 --> 26:40.422
Ok, first time for everything.

26:40.641 --> 26:43.599
Dance-off it is...
to the death!

26:43.811 --> 26:53.777
(applause)

27:00.369 --> 27:03.202
Oh that smells disgusting.

27:03.414 --> 27:06.372
Mind you, it's a
necessary anesthetic

27:06.584 --> 27:08.575
for the self-amputation
I'll be performing.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.035
Self ampu-what-now?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.245
Oh yeah, the whole
hand has to come off.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.582
Una Mens, bloody fascists.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.463
Oh well, at least
I won't feel a thing.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.509
Vex don't do
anything drastic...

27:19.722 --> 27:21.053
Oh no, don't worry about it.

27:21.265 --> 27:25.224
This is a potent potion
taught to me by a potent love,

27:25.436 --> 27:26.221
once upon a time.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.644
You wanna talk about love?

27:28.856 --> 27:33.941
Look at Lauren. I mean, she
didn't do a full amputation,

27:34.153 --> 27:35.438
she just took a little break.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.862
Do you ever
shut up about her?

27:38.074 --> 27:40.440
And now that break is over,
and we're back together

27:40.660 --> 27:41.649
with barely a bruise.

27:41.869 --> 27:45.908
See? Nothing drastic,
nothing permanent.

27:46.123 --> 27:49.365
Just, hmmm.

27:49.585 --> 27:50.620
What was that sound?

27:50.837 --> 27:52.953
That is the song of my heart.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.207
You wanna hear it again?

27:54.423 --> 27:56.379
Oh, yeah. I'd love to.

27:58.386 --> 27:59.421
Oh, boiling.

27:59.637 --> 28:06.258
(muffled noises)

28:06.477 --> 28:09.890
Yes, yes, all very
valid points...

28:10.106 --> 28:15.271
I don't undertake this lightly,
you know? I'm the last mesmer.

28:15.486 --> 28:19.104
My kind were feared
for their powers,

28:19.323 --> 28:24.238
hunted and slaughtered through
the ages by all the Fae.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.944
And the manner in which
they did it, well...

28:27.164 --> 28:29.780
You wanna know how?

28:30.001 --> 28:33.539
Their hands were cut off.

28:33.754 --> 28:39.590
Mesmers with nothing
but stumps, unable to feed.

28:39.802 --> 28:46.765
They died a slow, painful,
and humiliating death.

28:46.976 --> 28:50.309
I saw it happen
to my entire family,

28:50.521 --> 28:54.013
my brother, my father...

28:54.233 --> 28:56.975
and my mother.

28:57.194 --> 29:01.483
I promised myself I would
never let that happen to me.

29:01.699 --> 29:05.066
So I did what I
had to do to survive

29:05.286 --> 29:07.777
and become what I am today.

29:12.710 --> 29:16.077
A servant of the Dark.

29:16.297 --> 29:18.288
I will miss Ginger.

29:18.507 --> 29:22.546
But at least I'll still
be able to dance with Fred.

30:04.095 --> 30:09.431
Tamsin! Remember the
dance? 5, 6, 7, and...

30:28.285 --> 30:29.115
Yeah!

30:29.328 --> 30:32.661
Yeah!

31:17.460 --> 31:19.997
Okay, now would be the time to
use your power of doubt on her.

31:20.212 --> 31:20.746
I don't think I can.

31:20.963 --> 31:22.669
Jus-Just breathe
through the diaphragm

31:22.882 --> 31:23.792
and clench your butt cheeks.

31:24.008 --> 31:24.872
Do it!

31:56.665 --> 31:57.871
I think I clenched
my cheeks too hard.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.244
That's okay.

32:01.670 --> 32:04.833
The Valkryie has
mastered the disgraced Fae!

32:05.049 --> 32:08.633
Well done, our little
blooming warrior-princess!

32:24.443 --> 32:26.399
Chin-chin, luv.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.356
Aaaahhh!

32:33.786 --> 32:35.617
J‘ Come get your duds in order J‘

32:35.830 --> 32:38.242
J‘ cause we're bound
across the water J‘

32:38.457 --> 32:41.244
J‘ Heave away, my jollies,
heave away... J‘

32:41.460 --> 32:43.246
J‘ Come get your duds in order J‘

32:43.462 --> 32:45.874
J‘ 'cause we're bound
to leave tomorrow J‘

32:46.090 --> 32:50.379
J‘ Heave my boys,
we're all bound away... J‘

32:50.594 --> 32:52.255
Vex! Vex.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.257
I know how alone
you are right now.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.010
Out of all the places
you could have come to hide

32:57.226 --> 32:58.181
you came to Dyson's.

32:58.394 --> 33:00.385
Because somewhere
in that despicable,

33:00.604 --> 33:04.813
black heart of yours, you--
you wanted us to find you!

33:05.025 --> 33:06.151
Did not.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.567
Me, and Kenzi, and even Dyson.

33:08.779 --> 33:11.942
We are the only
family you have left.

33:12.158 --> 33:15.400
Owwwww! Ah the concoction
has had an adverse affect

33:15.619 --> 33:17.735
on this magic mold.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.867
It was supposed to
be an anesthetic...!

33:22.293 --> 33:25.581
Ahhh! Mother-Father, it burns!

33:25.796 --> 33:29.584
Heave away, me jollies.
We're all bound away!

33:29.800 --> 33:31.381
Vex!

33:31.594 --> 33:37.009
Auuuughhh!

33:50.446 --> 33:53.779
Oh, bollocks. I should have
got the right hand drive.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.606
Vex!

33:56.243 --> 33:59.235
Please. Don't take
me back to the Morrigan.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.821
You really only care
about yourself, don't you?

34:02.041 --> 34:02.905
What, and that's bad...?

34:03.125 --> 34:04.786
Why should I help you one bit
when you won't even tell me

34:05.002 --> 34:06.833
how I ended up
pledged to the Dark?

34:07.046 --> 34:08.752
Because I don't know
Jack-shit about it!

34:08.964 --> 34:10.579
I thought you were
having a laugh.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.926
I thought it was the
effect of the syringe.

34:13.135 --> 34:14.921
Actually I thought you
were soft in the head.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.423
Um no, no, and no.

34:17.640 --> 34:18.846
I really am
pledged to the Dark,

34:19.058 --> 34:20.423
I really don't
know how it happened,

34:20.643 --> 34:23.100
and I really need
answers before moonrise.

34:23.312 --> 34:26.349
So why the hell didn't you just
ask the Morrigan's Archivist?

34:26.565 --> 34:27.805
Archivist?

34:28.025 --> 34:30.732
Yeah! That bloke will have
your details at his fingertips.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.776
Are you sure you're
not soft in the head?

34:32.988 --> 34:36.230
Of course. Of course
she played me.

34:36.450 --> 34:39.066
So, uh everything's
good between us, yeah?

34:39.286 --> 34:40.401
You're gonna let me go?

34:40.621 --> 34:42.407
Because after all, if you
take me back to the Morrigan,

34:42.623 --> 34:44.238
she's only gonna
torture me to death,

34:44.458 --> 34:46.039
and I would hate to see that

34:46.252 --> 34:48.538
stain your lily
white conscience.

34:49.922 --> 34:53.881
Well. I'll take the clutch,
and you take the stick, yeah?

34:59.473 --> 35:01.009
All right, let's get
this over with.

35:01.225 --> 35:02.510
The moon is gonna
rise in minutes.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.058
And I know you can
tell me what happened.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.226
Where's Vex?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.019
Oh you mean the annoying
brother I kinda hate,

35:08.232 --> 35:12.316
never wanted, and is half
the mesmer he used to be?

35:12.528 --> 35:15.895
Thanks for sending me on a
wild goose chase, by the way.

35:16.573 --> 35:20.782
I need all of Vex to get
rid of the Una Mens.

35:22.746 --> 35:23.781
You're doing a real solid

35:23.998 --> 35:26.114
for all the local
Fae by bringing him in.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.164
I won't let you
torture and kill him.

35:28.377 --> 35:31.119
Oh honey, honey, honey.
Unlike the Light Fae,

35:31.338 --> 35:33.203
we don't hold grudges.

35:33.424 --> 35:35.961
All I care about is
getting rid of the Una Mens.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.757
But if you feel that
strongly about Vex,

35:37.970 --> 35:41.133
you can claim Vex
as your responsibility.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.055
And then it'll be on your
head to keep him in line.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.054
You ready to
put up or shut up?

35:46.270 --> 35:49.683
Fine. Archivist. Now.

35:49.898 --> 35:54.813
000 you figured it out,
I never would have guessed.

35:55.029 --> 35:56.519
Archivist!

35:56.739 --> 35:59.446
She's finally getting
her Dark shit together!

36:07.624 --> 36:11.742
Any pledge to the
Dark shows up here.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.918
Thanks...?

36:15.299 --> 36:21.886
There's your signature.
And there's your sponsor's.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.257
Well who's Rainer?

36:23.474 --> 36:24.964
Not a clue.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.765
Well tear this up.
I was obviously tricked.

36:26.977 --> 36:28.638
I have no memory
of signing it.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.970
The moon isn't up yet,
we still have time.

36:31.190 --> 36:34.432
Oh dear, I'm sorry. I--
I really am trying to be

36:34.651 --> 36:36.903
more poetic these days
when I lie to my friends.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.648
It makes life so
much more interesting.

36:38.864 --> 36:39.899
I am going to--

36:40.115 --> 36:41.821
You're going to nothing.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.990
You are a subject
of the Dark now,

36:44.203 --> 36:46.239
and you owe me your loyalty.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.992
This declaration is a
sacred and binding agreement,

36:49.208 --> 36:51.540
not even I have the
power to overturn it.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.788
Only your mystery sponsor
can help you with that.

36:54.004 --> 36:55.380
And good luck finding him.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.204
Whoever he is.

37:02.179 --> 37:05.171
That's mine.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.302
Come and get it.

37:07.518 --> 37:10.760
You know what, keep it.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.935
I have new toys
to entertain me.

37:25.035 --> 37:27.492
Is there anything
you wish to add?

37:27.704 --> 37:28.830
Only that I hope
you've retained some of

37:29.039 --> 37:31.997
the soul you once
had... Arabella.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.824
To know us by the
names we had before

37:34.044 --> 37:36.535
we took our solemn
vows is unholy!

37:36.755 --> 37:39.497
I know that you turned in your
own family for petty crimes

37:39.716 --> 37:41.331
when you became
one of the six.

37:41.552 --> 37:42.632
This is blasphemy.

37:42.845 --> 37:45.006
How could you ask The
Blood King to do the same?

37:45.222 --> 37:46.837
He'd turned in
his own daughter

37:47.057 --> 37:49.639
in order to satisfy the
rules that he'd created.

37:49.852 --> 37:52.138
And what he
created was cruelty.

37:52.354 --> 37:56.643
You mistake
orthodoxy for cruelty.

37:56.859 --> 38:00.898
Still, we cannot expect
our candidates to be perfect.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.853
With your history,
your standing,

38:03.073 --> 38:06.065
and your knowledge,
you are the only choice.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.946
Choice?

38:08.162 --> 38:09.743
For acting Ash.

38:15.335 --> 38:17.542
I hate that woman.
Full moon bullshit.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.494
Turns out I can't
un-Dark myself.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.251
There has to be a way.

38:21.467 --> 38:22.798
Well, at least
I have you back.

38:23.010 --> 38:25.126
Come on, let me take you
home and we will wash away

38:25.345 --> 38:27.722
all this double-dealing
and manipulation in, say,

38:27.931 --> 38:30.263
a giant claw-foot bathtub?

38:30.476 --> 38:33.434
Besides... this ice
is gonna melt.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.722
Hey, what's wrong?

38:38.275 --> 38:40.732
I don't think that
I can go back there.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.275
With the Light.

38:42.488 --> 38:43.819
I don't understand.

38:44.031 --> 38:48.024
When the Una Mens started
killing humans, and I ran,

38:48.243 --> 38:51.155
the Light never bothered
to come looking for me.

38:51.371 --> 38:54.613
But the Dark? They sought
me out, offered me protection.

38:54.833 --> 38:55.538
Lauren--

38:55.751 --> 38:58.083
Oh sure, they were
drama queens about it.

38:58.295 --> 39:00.832
Tested me by forcing me to
diagnose one of their Elders.

39:01.048 --> 39:05.087
But they came--
when no one else did.

39:05.302 --> 39:06.337
I would have come, but--

39:06.553 --> 39:08.885
But you couldn't. I know.

39:09.097 --> 39:12.931
I'm not angry Bo... with you.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.384
With the Dark, I can
come and go as I please.

39:15.604 --> 39:17.014
I'm with them on my terms.

39:17.231 --> 39:18.971
There's no binding agreements.

39:19.191 --> 39:20.852
There's no dog collar.

39:21.068 --> 39:22.023
I can't believe
that I'm saying this,

39:22.236 --> 39:25.023
but for the first
time Bo, I feel free.

39:25.239 --> 39:28.902
But I could free you.
We can be free together!

39:29.117 --> 39:30.698
How?

39:30.911 --> 39:33.402
Fight for you. Protect you.

39:33.622 --> 39:34.907
Claim you, if I have to--

39:35.123 --> 39:37.079
You mean own me?

39:40.295 --> 39:43.082
You're Fae, I'm human.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.003
So what?

39:44.216 --> 39:45.752
So, I'll always
be a prisoner.

39:45.968 --> 39:48.801
The least I can do
is choose my own cage.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.972
It's gonna be okay, Bo.

39:54.184 --> 39:57.802
Now that you're Dark...
I'll see you around.

40:04.111 --> 40:08.229
When you're ready to come
back to your real family,

40:08.448 --> 40:09.733
just say the word.

40:28.594 --> 40:29.754
Now that you're free, Bruce,

40:29.970 --> 40:33.258
why don't you actually
go to Bora Bora. Or wherever.

40:33.473 --> 40:36.715
Just like, take off,
find yourself.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.471
I don't know.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.144
I've always been
the Morrigan's man.

40:41.356 --> 40:45.065
A killer, a protector.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.017
I can't really
do anything else.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.568
Well maybe not,
but you'll never know

40:48.780 --> 40:51.567
until you give
it a shot big guy.

40:51.783 --> 40:55.776
Find your wings, Brushi. Fly.

40:55.996 --> 40:58.078
You know?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.579
Bring home a
stray puppy, okay.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.252
A wounded bird, fine.

41:06.465 --> 41:09.002
But I never thought I'd see
the day when my granddaughter

41:09.217 --> 41:12.129
would show up at my doorstep
with a one-handed mesmer

41:12.346 --> 41:14.678
claiming she threw
in with the Dark.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.551
Is this thing legit?

41:16.767 --> 41:18.723
I believe it is.

41:18.935 --> 41:20.141
You joined the Dark.

41:20.354 --> 41:22.891
But you're gonna help me figure
out how to fix this mess?

41:23.106 --> 41:27.145
I hope so, Bo. But things
have gotten complicated.

41:27.361 --> 41:28.396
How?

41:28.612 --> 41:31.649
The Una Mens need a
caretaker for the Light Fae.

41:31.865 --> 41:37.485
And they've decided to
name me... the acting Ash.

41:37.704 --> 41:42.118
So my grandfather is
the head of the Light?

41:42.334 --> 41:46.828
And my granddaughter is
the darling of the Dark.

41:48.799 --> 41:51.415
The Una Mens
must be loving this.

41:54.137 --> 41:58.301
They don't love. And they
don't hate. No emotions.

41:58.517 --> 41:59.552
What else is there?

41:59.768 --> 42:02.760
Rules. And if you don't
follow them willingly,

42:02.979 --> 42:05.061
they'll do whatever
it takes to make you.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.729
And it won't be pleasant.

42:06.942 --> 42:09.308
Our family is such a mess.

42:11.196 --> 42:14.609
Yet somehow, Isabeau,
we muddle through.

42:17.953 --> 42:19.568
What about my
so-called sponsor?

42:19.788 --> 42:21.198
Rainer.

42:22.457 --> 42:25.824
There's only one sure
way to find out who he is.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.080
The Kings' Book of Records.

42:30.465 --> 42:31.545
We'll find it.

43:06.710 --> 43:10.669
The Succubus' declaration,
as you commanded.

43:14.342 --> 43:20.178
Rainer.

43:20.390 --> 43:24.349
Rainer. Rainer.

43:27.063 --> 43:31.682
No, it can not be.
Never again!
