WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:02.524
- Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:02.567 --> 00:03.829
- I'm Charlie.

00:03.873 --> 00:05.092
- We're The Smell.
We're a band.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.397
- She's a shape-shifter.

00:06.441 --> 00:07.398
- Remember when we
dented history?

00:07.442 --> 00:08.530
- I have encountered a glitch

00:08.573 --> 00:10.227
during the Heyworld Event.
- Find me.

00:10.271 --> 00:11.924
- Your sister is the dent.

00:11.968 --> 00:14.144
- Maybe her being here,
she'll remember who she was.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.076
- Hope The Smell plays
"Assassination Nation" tonight.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.122
- Could give a rat's ass
what they play,

00:35.165 --> 00:37.689
long as Charlie isn't AWOL
two nights in a row.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.230
- Six quid.
Don't be cheeky.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.998
- Ian's dead, Dec.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.088
We gotta get out of here
before that psycho finds us.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.148
- What do you want?

01:45.192 --> 01:46.410
- Clotho.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.760
- What the bloody hell's
a Clotho?

01:48.804 --> 01:50.240
- The lead singer of your band.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.590
- You mean Charlie?
She left days ago.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.418
Don't hurt me.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.987
- My sister should know by now
she can't outrun Fate.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.503
- Mm.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.956
Ah!
- Ah!

02:53.999 --> 02:55.305
both: Ah!
- Wait.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.350
Are we screaming
because it's weird

02:56.393 --> 02:57.655
or because it's awesome?

02:57.699 --> 02:59.527
- This is

02:59.570 --> 03:00.876
a nightmare.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.052
How did I even get
in your room?

03:03.095 --> 03:04.793
- You slept-walked
into Dr. Heywood's room

03:04.836 --> 03:06.708
at approximately 2:30 a.m.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.231
I tried to wake you,

03:08.275 --> 03:09.711
but you assaulted
my mainframe,

03:09.754 --> 03:11.278
repeating Snooze.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.410
- Hey, let's just be cool
about this, okay?

03:13.454 --> 03:16.065
I still have my pajamas on,
which means we didn't--

03:16.108 --> 03:17.806
- Oh, my God.
- Take it easy.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.547
You slept-walked into my room,

03:19.590 --> 03:21.679
which means something
must have brought you in here.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.247
And let's not forget, in
another timeline, you and I--

03:24.291 --> 03:25.814
- Don't start
with the dream girl crap.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.250
I'm still trying to process

03:27.294 --> 03:30.079
how I spent
the last five hours in...

03:30.122 --> 03:32.647
What is this, 200 thread count?
- Yeah.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.605
- I gotta go.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.263
- Ah!
- You're up early.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.439
- Um.
What are you doing?

03:42.483 --> 03:44.833
- Looks like somebody was
playing Operation

03:44.876 --> 03:46.182
with Gideon's mainframe.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.097
Or maybe it was something.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.794
You think they have raccoons
in the Temporal Zone?

03:49.838 --> 03:51.622
- Actually, Mr. Tarazi,
it was--

03:51.666 --> 03:53.058
- Snooze, Gideon.

03:53.102 --> 03:56.192
- Hey.
You left this in my bedroom.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.673
- Oh.
- Well, looky-looky.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.544
- We did not hook up.
- We didn't hook up.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.459
- It doesn't have to be a walk
of shame if you enjoyed it.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.940
But, if you are walking at all,
you didn't enjoy it enough.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.333
- Gross, Charlie.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.639
- Hey, B, uh.
Me and Z did not do--

04:08.683 --> 04:09.814
you know--the nasty.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.512
- This is a judgment-free zone.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.078
I'm not one to shame
the sexual activity

04:13.122 --> 04:14.776
of two consenting adults.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.821
- Shame's a good thing.
Keeps you from hooking up

04:16.865 --> 04:18.780
with someone and ending up

04:18.823 --> 04:21.609
the parent
of a 16-year-old daughter.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.569
- Oh, ooh, well,
what naughty business

04:25.613 --> 04:26.962
have I stumbled across, then?

04:27.005 --> 04:29.312
- Uh, nothing.
We just--we like, um,

04:29.356 --> 04:33.273
hanging out in hallways.
Nothing, good-bye.

04:35.753 --> 04:39.191
Well, then, Charlie.
We have some business

04:39.235 --> 04:40.671
to attend to, love.
- We do.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.326
But first, whiskey.
- All right, then.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.937
- A stiff drink may indeed
be in order.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.722
I have
some rather unfortunate news

04:47.765 --> 04:50.072
for you, Charlie.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.740
- Charlie.
Hey.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.394
We came as soon as we heard.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.047
Look, the Prognosticator's
scanning the timeline

05:09.091 --> 05:10.310
for Encore activity.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.354
Trust me,
we're gonna figure out

05:11.398 --> 05:12.790
who's responsible for this.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.706
- This wasn't the work
of an Encore.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.405
This was my sister, Atropos.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.494
- How can you tell?

05:22.496 --> 05:24.976
- "The victim was burnt
from the inside."

05:25.020 --> 05:27.370
She's a god.
That's her signature move.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.285
- Well, I'm sorry
about your friends, Charlie,

05:29.329 --> 05:32.462
but, uh, your sister just fired
one hell of a warning shot.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.811
Now we need to get
back out there

05:33.855 --> 05:35.552
and find that Loom piece
before she does.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.599
- God, will you just
piss off, John?

05:40.165 --> 05:42.516
- Hey, Charlie.
Look, I'm sorry.

05:42.559 --> 05:43.865
I--I've lost friends, too.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.301
I know what you're
going through.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.129
- Look, I respect
your condolences,

05:47.172 --> 05:48.391
but you don't have
a bloody clue

05:48.435 --> 05:49.523
what I'm going through.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.399
Well, she's right.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.096
We're putting the hunt
for the Loom on hold.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.707
And it's probably
for the best.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.796
With Ray gone, we're still
trying to find our feet.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.058
- That gives us time
to make a game plan.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.755
- But we do have a game plan.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.278
We need to get the next piece.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.715
- Look, John,
if you wanna help,

06:07.758 --> 06:09.847
then look into
what we're up against.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.066
She's a god.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.415
I don't wanna take the team

06:12.459 --> 06:14.112
into a situation
we can't get out of.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.853
- Yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.420
I overstepped the mark,
didn't I?

06:17.464 --> 06:18.726
I'm sorry.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.816
I am sorry, Charlie,

06:21.859 --> 06:24.340
but my promise
to Astra and her mum

06:24.384 --> 06:25.950
cannot wait
for your tears to dry.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.390
Ostende mihi viam.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.405
Ah.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.170
- Welcome back,

07:12.214 --> 07:13.215
sis.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.086
- Lachesis.

07:15.130 --> 07:19.090
- You smell of that slowly
dying world filled with apathy.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.962
Any luck?

07:21.005 --> 07:24.400
- Clotho has taken on
a vulgar, mortal name:

07:24.444 --> 07:26.707
Charlie.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.579
- Oh, this is too good
to be true.

07:29.623 --> 07:30.711
- Elaborate.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.495
- My protégé, Astra,

07:32.539 --> 07:34.323
happens to know
of a time traveler

07:34.366 --> 07:36.891
who's looking for our Loom.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.110
One of his companions
is a woman.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.503
Goes by Charlie.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.983
- A time traveler.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.941
That's how Clotho
has eluded me.

07:43.985 --> 07:47.771
- Fortunately, I can track
John Constantine.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.482
Without Fate,

08:02.525 --> 08:05.746
mortals are making a mess
of their lives.

08:08.618 --> 08:12.230
With our Loom,
order can be restored.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.538
Find John Constantine,
and you will find our sister.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.502
And when you do...

08:22.545 --> 08:25.287
make it a hell
of a family reunion.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.378
- Gideon, next time John
steals the jumpship,

08:29.421 --> 08:30.684
a little heads-up
would be nice.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.207
- Thanks to Ms. Tarazi,

08:32.250 --> 08:33.556
I'm still stuck
on snooze mode.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.818
- Is your sister
just looking for you,

08:34.862 --> 08:35.906
or is she looking
for the Loom?

08:35.950 --> 08:37.168
- Both, I reckon.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.606
We have to go after him.
- We?

08:39.649 --> 08:40.955
That bastard's
the reason I'm mortal.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.347
I don't owe him squat.

08:42.391 --> 08:43.218
- He's going after the ring.
You're the only one

08:43.261 --> 08:45.437
who knows where he's headed.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.309
- Look, we'll be in and out.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.746
- Okay, fine.
Soon as we get going,

08:49.790 --> 08:51.748
the sooner I can get back
to drinking in peace.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.315
- Great, let's portal.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.886
- Parenting sucks!

09:00.757 --> 09:03.064
- Hmm.
- Maybe I should stay, huh?

09:03.107 --> 09:05.719
- Are you volunteering
for Rory duty?

09:05.762 --> 09:09.766
Ava Sharpe, you are
a better woman than I.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.856
Okay, babe.
Catch you on the flip side.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.772
- Stay safe.

09:20.342 --> 09:21.604
- The ring's that way.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.040
- He couldn't have gotten
too far.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.955
Let's gear up in the jumpship.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.701
- Kid's not into bears, huh?

09:33.616 --> 09:35.836
- She ripped its head off.
- Yeah, I see that.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.925
Well, like father,
like daughter.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.274
I mean, hey,
you should be proud.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.667
At least she's tough, like you.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.626
- She said I ruined her life.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.673
Now I gotta portal back
to that stupid reunion party

09:46.716 --> 09:49.676
and stop myself
from sleeping with Ali.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.025
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There are so many reasons

09:51.068 --> 09:52.200
why that's a bad idea.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.636
- Don't care.
- Stop.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.811
You can't just erase

09:54.855 --> 09:56.117
your daughter's existence,
Mick.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.989
There has to be another option.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.643
- What?

10:00.687 --> 10:02.427
- What if we go back
through the last 15 years,

10:02.471 --> 10:04.995
and we--and we place you
into all of her key memories?

10:05.039 --> 10:06.693
- Like a highlight reel.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.825
- Yeah, I mean, it's kind of
what Rip did with me.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.653
Programmed me
with a bunch of memories

10:10.697 --> 10:12.263
that added up
to be a childhood.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.265
It wasn't perfect,
but I turned out okay.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.789
- She's not a clone.
- Ouch.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.486
Yeah, she's not a hmm,

10:17.529 --> 10:19.706
but she is programmable,
in a sense.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.925
- Won't work.
- Why?

10:21.969 --> 10:25.276
- I spent the first ten years
of her life in prison.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.669
- Right.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.022
I have an idea.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.072
You sure hid this one well.

10:38.115 --> 10:41.902
- Didn't think I'd ever be
coming back here, did I?

10:43.294 --> 10:45.209
- Huh.
That's cool.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.211
Looks like "Supernatural's"
filming here.

10:47.255 --> 10:50.780
- Super-what?
- You've never seen it?

10:50.824 --> 10:53.261
It's this show
about these two hot brothers

10:53.304 --> 10:55.306
who fight demons.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.569
I wonder if the Winchester
brothers are here!

10:57.613 --> 11:00.311
- Seriously?
- Dean is my hall pass.

11:04.011 --> 11:07.275
- I bet you used to wild out
back in the day.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.016
- There was no drinking
on the job.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.626
It's kind of
the occupational hazard

11:10.670 --> 11:14.021
of having the Fate of humanity
in your hands.

11:14.064 --> 11:17.111
- So you guys literally
used to weave Fate?

11:17.154 --> 11:19.374
- I mean, it's not like it is
in the storybooks,

11:19.417 --> 11:21.419
but yeah.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.639
I spun up the threads
of each life.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.947
Old Lachesis--she measured out
how long each life got to be.

11:26.990 --> 11:30.559
And then, Atropos, she...

11:30.602 --> 11:33.910
- So she killed--
- Everyone.

11:33.954 --> 11:37.305
And she bloody loved it.

11:56.890 --> 12:00.415
- Hello?
- Greetings, sibling of mine.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.289
- Meow?

12:05.333 --> 12:08.249
- You okay, Z?
Is this about the Nate thing?

12:08.292 --> 12:10.512
I hope not, because then I'm
wondering why you just said,

12:10.555 --> 12:12.557
"Meow," and I definitely
don't want to know.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.429
I think I may be losing it,

12:14.472 --> 12:16.779
and not like
when I saw Tupac's hologram

12:16.823 --> 12:18.650
at the 2044 Grammy's.

12:18.694 --> 12:22.611
But, like, mentally losing it.
Something is wrong with me.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.787
- Hey, hey.
Deep breaths.

12:31.315 --> 12:32.664
This is like a form of therapy

12:32.708 --> 12:35.798
where you get to beat up
your problems.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.191
Trust me.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.382
- Whoa, did you just beat me?

12:54.425 --> 12:58.255
- Behrad, I don't know
how to play video games.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.475
But it's like I'm being haunted
by someone who does,

13:00.518 --> 13:02.172
someone who dresses
like a teenage boy

13:02.216 --> 13:04.348
and makes me do awful things
like eat donuts

13:04.392 --> 13:06.437
and...cuddle with Nate.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.092
both: Whoa.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.923
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

13:18.406 --> 13:21.148
- Well, what have we got here?

13:26.327 --> 13:27.807
Oh!

13:27.850 --> 13:29.156
- What the bloody hell is that?

13:29.199 --> 13:31.549
- It's a prop.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.029
- And what did I tell you
about Loom patrol?

13:33.073 --> 13:34.422
- Yeah, well, we're out here,
aren't we?

13:34.465 --> 13:35.510
So let's just find
the damn thing.

13:35.553 --> 13:36.598
- Oh, yeah, have you scanned

13:36.641 --> 13:37.904
the woods for activity?

13:37.947 --> 13:38.905
Huh?
Do you have a plan

13:38.948 --> 13:40.645
if Atropos shows up?

13:40.689 --> 13:42.865
- Ah, well, I clipped Charlie's
shapeshifter wings,

13:42.909 --> 13:44.084
so, no offense, love,

13:44.127 --> 13:45.520
I think I can handle
her sister.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.391
- Have you not heard
anything Charlie's said?

13:47.435 --> 13:49.132
'Cause it's not gonna
be that easy.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.613
- Clotho.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.963
- You are my responsibility,
and I say we are going back

13:54.007 --> 13:55.922
to figure out
a secure way to do this.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.533
- Yeah, well that Loom is your
ticket to stopping the Encores.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.014
- You can't hide
from your family.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.189
- Guys!

14:06.367 --> 14:09.152
- Jumpship.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.897
- I'm coming for you, Clotho.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.334
- My sister.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.945
She's here.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.256
- Ava, we need backup.
Ava?

14:26.300 --> 14:28.868
Damn it, with the jumpship
gone, the comms are down.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.434
- What, so we're stuck here?

14:30.478 --> 14:33.655
- The team will come looking
for us eventually.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.223
We need these
more than Sam and Dean.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.225
- You've walked us right
into a bloody death trap.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.922
- And that was my only option,
all right?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.184
If she gets her hand
on one piece of the Loom,

14:41.228 --> 14:42.403
then she can get the next,

14:42.446 --> 14:43.404
and then she's that much closer

14:43.447 --> 14:44.579
to controlling us all.

14:44.622 --> 14:45.928
And I'll bet my bottom dollar

14:45.972 --> 14:47.277
she's out there now
looking for it,

14:47.321 --> 14:48.757
not standing around
having a row

14:48.800 --> 14:50.498
in the middle
of the bloody forest.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.109
- Damn it, John.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.068
The stupid thing's that way.

14:55.111 --> 14:58.114
- By building Heyworld,
we changed the future,

14:58.158 --> 15:00.508
which caused the bifurcation
of the timeline

15:00.551 --> 15:02.684
radiating from that one moment.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.512
Think of it as
a historical traffic accident,

15:04.555 --> 15:05.992
and you're the dents.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.645
- Yeah, I'm not thinking
of myself as a dent.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.910
- Okay, so what you think of
as a haunting

15:10.953 --> 15:12.999
is a temporal echo.

15:13.042 --> 15:16.219
She is the you
before, well, you.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.917
- Okay, let's just get
something straight.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.136
There is only one
Zari Tarazi.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.398
I filed a trademark.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.660
- Do you know what this means?

15:22.704 --> 15:24.140
You were a Legend.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.620
From what you said
about the hacking,

15:25.663 --> 15:27.317
you were probably
our computer expert.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.406
- And the air totem
responded to you.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.973
You two probably shared it.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.323
both:
Wonder twins.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.064
- And we probably had a really
super cute couple name.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.500
Just off the top of my head,

15:36.544 --> 15:38.198
probably something
like SteelHacker.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.895
- Three of us probably
hung out all the time...

15:39.939 --> 15:40.983
- Ah.
- Getting stoned...

15:41.027 --> 15:42.506
- Oh, man!

15:42.550 --> 15:44.030
- Playing ring toss
with donuts.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.988
- She probably helped you
save the world.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.468
- More than once.
- Yeah.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.557
She sounds pretty cool, huh?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.037
- Yeah.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.777
Yeah, she does.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.173
- We've gotta move faster.
She could be anywhere.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.653
- Clotho.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.308
You can't escape.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.875
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

16:03.919 --> 16:07.575
- We need to keep moving, love.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.187
- Where are you?

16:11.231 --> 16:13.668
Come to me,

16:13.711 --> 16:18.629
or your friends will die.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.459
- Charlie?

16:30.815 --> 16:31.991
- Uh-oh.
Mick?

16:32.034 --> 16:33.731
- What?

16:33.775 --> 16:35.559
- I think Ali was discharged
from the hospital early,

16:35.603 --> 16:37.735
because a taxicab
just pulled up outside.

16:37.779 --> 16:40.260
- Wait, this is supposed
to be a s--

16:40.303 --> 16:41.522
Surprise.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.653
- Is that what
they're gonna say

16:42.697 --> 16:43.654
at Iron Heights when they find

16:43.698 --> 16:45.439
your empty cell?

16:45.482 --> 16:46.744
What the hell
are you doing here, Mick?

16:46.788 --> 16:49.095
- Oh, uh, hi.
I'm Ava Sharpe.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.619
I'm Mr. Rory's CO.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.012
Yeah, I arranged
for some visitation

16:53.055 --> 16:54.709
in exchange
for some information.

16:54.752 --> 16:55.840
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.233
Mr. Rory's helped us bring in

16:57.277 --> 16:58.408
some of history's
most dangerous criminals.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.801
- What?
- Yup.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.455
- Okay, well,
visiting hours are over.

17:01.498 --> 17:05.067
Me and my baby are tired.
- Right.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.200
- Wow.

17:07.243 --> 17:10.377
- Ah.
From Victorian England times--

17:10.420 --> 17:13.597
- Collection.
Collection at Pottery Barn.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.208
- I don't know much
about Victorian England,

17:15.251 --> 17:18.950
but it's really beautiful.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.256
- I bet she is too.

17:25.957 --> 17:29.178
- Mick, meet your daughter.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.228
- Mmm.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.707
Lita.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.100
- Hey, how about
we all get together

17:38.144 --> 17:39.362
so that Lita
can remember this moment

17:39.406 --> 17:40.842
with her dad forever?
Yeah?

17:40.885 --> 17:43.410
Let's take a picture.

17:43.453 --> 17:47.066
Aww, Mickey!

17:51.722 --> 17:54.073
- Smiles!

17:54.116 --> 17:55.813
- Wait a minute.
Did you break into my house?

18:01.036 --> 18:04.300
- Garibba lifted
the king's decapitated head.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.175
Dumb bastard.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.177
You like that?

18:11.220 --> 18:13.570
- Daddy?

18:13.614 --> 18:14.963
- Ah!

18:15.006 --> 18:16.399
Do you believe
in the tooth fairy?

18:16.443 --> 18:17.835
- Yay.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.624
- Whoa!

18:28.846 --> 18:30.283
- Say cheese.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.261
- Say cheese.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.268
- Kirk, we can get you
new pants.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.965
- How's that
for a highlight reel?

19:01.009 --> 19:03.751
Pretty good.

19:11.628 --> 19:15.066
- Hello, Clotho.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.852
Look at you, alone,

19:17.895 --> 19:19.767
after destroying our family.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.986
- Look, I didn't do it
to hurt you, all right?

19:22.030 --> 19:25.120
- We took care of you,
and you took everything we had.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.166
- People deserve to be free.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.342
- And what have they done with
this freedom you gave them?

19:29.385 --> 19:31.735
- They got women the vote.
They invented punk rock.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.824
- Introduced mass genocide,

19:33.868 --> 19:36.349
nuclear bombs,
pollution,

19:36.392 --> 19:38.960
systematic incarceration.
- No, I didn't--

19:39.003 --> 19:40.701
- And after all you did
to help them,

19:40.744 --> 19:41.963
how did they thank you?

19:44.270 --> 19:47.925
- By locking you in prison.

19:47.969 --> 19:51.146
We would never let anyone hurt
you like that, little sister.

19:54.628 --> 19:58.022
Now lead me to our Loom,

19:58.066 --> 20:00.329
and perhaps, in time,
we can forgive you.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.860
- Hey!

20:09.904 --> 20:13.124
Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

20:21.481 --> 20:23.004
John, I could use
a little help!

20:23.047 --> 20:25.136
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm on it, I'm on it.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.574
Where'd you go?
Hemlock!

20:27.617 --> 20:30.098
All right, yes.
Oh!

20:30.141 --> 20:33.101
Toadstool.
Got it.

20:35.364 --> 20:38.628
Now all I need
is a little bit of--

20:38.672 --> 20:40.326
blood.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.158
Te vocare, veni

20:47.202 --> 20:50.466
in auxilium mihi.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.736
Go, grab Charlie.
Get the hell out of here.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.521
I'll find ya!

21:03.218 --> 21:05.089
- You're gonna be okay.
Come on.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.584
- Hey.
Let's wait for John here.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.933
- John's dead, Sara.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.935
Atropos doesn't let
people live.

21:24.979 --> 21:26.328
Come on.
We've got to keep going.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.243
- Look, it's okay.
- It's not.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.505
I mean, you saw
what happened back there.

21:29.549 --> 21:30.680
I'm one of them.

21:30.724 --> 21:31.855
No matter what I do, I'm never

21:31.899 --> 21:33.466
gonna be able to escape them,

21:33.509 --> 21:34.902
and now I've gone
and got John killed.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.295
- Hey, look.
John always finds a way.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.341
- Always finds a way
to do what?

21:39.385 --> 21:41.865
- Oh, thank God.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.911
- Yeah, I'd rather not, love.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.349
Well, your sister--
she's a nasty piece of work,

21:47.393 --> 21:48.655
but it takes more
than amateur knife tricks

21:48.698 --> 21:50.221
to do me in.

21:50.265 --> 21:51.701
Well, let's get the hell
out of here, shall we?

21:51.745 --> 21:53.355
Before she realizes
I'm not bleeding out

21:53.399 --> 21:55.052
on the forest floor.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.638
- Who are you?

22:15.682 --> 22:16.944
- Talking to donuts now?

22:16.987 --> 22:18.772
- LOL.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.991
- This alternate timeline
stuff's got you

22:21.035 --> 22:23.559
really shaken up, huh?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.518
- Ever since Mithra
came into my life,

22:25.561 --> 22:28.477
I've been the center
of attention.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.871
It's weird to have
to share the spotlight.

22:30.914 --> 22:34.831
- Says the older sister
to the younger brother.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.573
- Right.
Sorry.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.794
Back to me.
It's a lot to take in.

22:40.837 --> 22:43.710
I mean, this other Zari
sounds so...

22:43.753 --> 22:46.365
smart and substantive,

22:46.408 --> 22:49.846
like a cool,
third-wave feminist superhero

22:49.890 --> 22:53.720
that you and Nate
seem to like better than me.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.678
- First off, Nate
is just a sucker

22:55.722 --> 22:56.810
for doomed romances.

22:56.853 --> 22:57.985
Secondly, of course

22:58.028 --> 22:59.421
I don't like her
better than you.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.510
You're my favorite Zari
of all time.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.599
But...

23:03.643 --> 23:05.209
- But?

23:05.253 --> 23:06.515
- You said you wanted to leave

23:06.559 --> 23:08.038
your whole
Z-Nation life behind,

23:08.082 --> 23:09.736
find out what else
you're capable of.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.433
This whole situation seems like

23:11.477 --> 23:14.305
a gift-wrapped opportunity
for self-exploration.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.438
- Self-exploration?

23:16.482 --> 23:20.311
- I propose a totem quest.

23:20.355 --> 23:23.140
Go into the totem,
speak to our ancestors.

23:23.184 --> 23:26.970
- Mm-hmm.
Um, how do I go into the totem?

23:27.014 --> 23:28.102
- With a little
psychotropic assistance.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.451
- Hmm.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.757
I knew this would lead
to drugs.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.541
- It's totally safe.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.151
I've done it in the past
when I've been wrestling

23:34.195 --> 23:36.371
with a big problem.

23:37.851 --> 23:40.593
It's no crazier
than talking to a donut.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.423
I know that face!

23:44.466 --> 23:46.076
That's the one where you don't
want to admit I'm right.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.252
- No, it isn't.

23:48.296 --> 23:51.517
- Totem-town, here we come.
- Hmm.

23:54.781 --> 23:57.566
She played me like a fiddle.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.481
I almost gave her the loom.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.005
- Family knows
all of our weaknesses.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.225
- I don't know.
Maybe she's right.

24:04.268 --> 24:06.662
I belong with them.
- Come on, Charlie.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.185
- I'm a coward, Sara.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.709
I can't even stand up
to my own sister.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.232
- Hey, listen to me.

24:11.275 --> 24:12.581
No one is responsible

24:12.625 --> 24:14.540
for the family
they are born into.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.194
All that matters is who
they decide to be,

24:17.238 --> 24:20.067
and you've decided
to be brave and big-hearted.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.724
- Thanks, boss.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.682
But I am what I am.

24:34.342 --> 24:37.650
She's gonna love it.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.963
- Surprise.
- What's this?

24:49.400 --> 24:52.186
- Nice, it's a keepsake album

24:52.229 --> 24:55.972
so I can never forget all the
times that you bailed on me.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.365
- Well, I was in prison--

24:57.408 --> 24:58.845
- Not since 2015.

25:01.935 --> 25:05.242
You know I never actually
went to homecoming.

25:05.286 --> 25:06.722
I went back inside
to get my purse,

25:06.766 --> 25:08.550
and when I came back out,
you were gone.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.117
And I kept telling Kirk to wait

25:10.160 --> 25:12.336
because I wanted to say
good-bye to you,

25:12.380 --> 25:15.165
but you had bailed.
Like always.

25:17.646 --> 25:18.778
So keep it.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.521
- Fine.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.088
- Uh, and there is
that patented Mick Rory fade.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.568
You know, good old dad.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.571
Just run away
like you always do, yeah?

25:33.053 --> 25:35.577
- Wait.
W-w-w-w-wait--I--

25:35.621 --> 25:37.623
I'm sorry.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.363
Rory, it was a terrible idea,

25:39.407 --> 25:42.584
and I never should've
suggested it, okay?

25:42.628 --> 25:45.239
Rory, we can--listen to me.
We can fix this.

25:45.282 --> 25:46.980
- No, we can't.
- Yes, we can.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.851
I--look, I made a mistake
and I feel really bad,

25:48.895 --> 25:49.896
but that doesn't
give us the right

25:49.939 --> 25:51.375
to keep hurting Lita

25:51.419 --> 25:53.290
any more than we already have.
Right?

25:53.334 --> 25:54.814
Maybe it's not about the gifts,

25:54.857 --> 25:56.337
and the money,

25:56.380 --> 25:58.426
and the big birthday parties,
you know?

25:58.469 --> 26:00.123
I think it's time that
you go back in there

26:00.167 --> 26:02.082
and do what we should've done
from the beginning.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.518
- Go back
and kick myself in the--

26:03.562 --> 26:06.303
- No.
No.

26:06.347 --> 26:09.916
Just go tell her you're sorry.

26:09.959 --> 26:13.310
- Hmm.
Guess you're right.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.660
No shortcuts.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.976
- What happened to this place?

26:27.020 --> 26:28.499
- Whoa.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.507
- Oh, it's the crew!

26:36.551 --> 26:39.989
Wait, if they're dead,
who's shooting season 15?

26:40.033 --> 26:41.730
- You leave a piece
of the Loom of Fate

26:41.774 --> 26:44.472
somewhere long enough,
there's gonna be consequences.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.560
- Don't worry about it.
I'll nab it.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.040
- No, John.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.259
Look, this is my mess,
all right?

26:49.303 --> 26:50.783
I'll do it.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.523
Look, all I've gotta do
is run over there,

26:52.567 --> 26:54.177
put my hand in that hole,

26:54.221 --> 26:55.875
grab the ring,
and Bob's your uncle.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.180
- All right,
well then let's go,

26:57.224 --> 27:00.183
before your sister shows up.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.374
- Uhh, what's going on?
- Shh.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.767
- Hey, girl.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.508
- Zari just took
some Lyoga root.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.815
She needs a little totem trip
to figure out her stuff.

27:22.858 --> 27:25.339
- Uh, Gideon, what's the status
with the away-team?

27:25.382 --> 27:27.428
- The jumpship
is not responding.

27:27.471 --> 27:28.995
- Gideon, we talked about this.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.649
Un-snooze.
You need to tell me

27:30.692 --> 27:33.390
about things
before they happen, not after.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.610
- Okay, we should help them.

27:35.654 --> 27:39.309
Ooh, ooh.
I feel high already.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.833
Is it too late to detox?

27:40.876 --> 27:41.877
- That's the fun of drugs.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.313
You can't un-take them.

27:43.357 --> 27:46.186
- Hmm.
- Besides, this is important.

27:46.229 --> 27:47.709
Everything's gonna be fine,
sis.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.145
- Okay.

27:49.189 --> 27:52.627
I surrender.

28:05.031 --> 28:07.250
Hello?

28:07.294 --> 28:09.078
Ancestors?

28:11.602 --> 28:13.343
Where are all
the old people at?

28:13.387 --> 28:14.954
- Who you calling old?

28:25.094 --> 28:26.574
- So, if you're here,
does that mean

28:26.617 --> 28:29.795
Maman and Baba...
Behrad?

28:29.838 --> 28:31.405
- Oh, B's back
on the Waverider.

28:31.448 --> 28:32.623
Who do you think
gave me the drugs?

28:32.667 --> 28:34.103
- He's alive.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.715
- Yeah, of course.
Maman and Baba too.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.459
Are you okay?

28:42.503 --> 28:45.724
- Yeah.
Yeah.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.769
- So why are you even asking me
about Behrad?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.336
I thought this was about me

28:49.379 --> 28:51.512
and the strange visions
I've been having.

28:51.555 --> 28:52.992
- Wow.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.821
New me came out
shockingly self-absorbed.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.736
- Who are you calling
the new you?

28:57.779 --> 29:00.173
Who even are you?

29:00.216 --> 29:04.264
- Well...you,

29:04.307 --> 29:06.353
if the Legends
hadn't saved the world,

29:06.396 --> 29:09.530
and you grew up
in dystopian Seattle.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.662
Once the timeline crystallized,

29:11.706 --> 29:13.229
you were out in the real world,

29:13.273 --> 29:14.927
and I was thrown in here

29:14.970 --> 29:17.494
with the rest
of the totem bearers.

29:17.538 --> 29:20.410
- Wait, does that mean
Nate was right?

29:20.454 --> 29:22.761
Are you the cooler me?

29:22.804 --> 29:24.850
Ugh.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.982
- We have a lot to talk about.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.817
- Hey, do carbs count
if you eat them in a totem?

29:35.861 --> 29:37.950
- Nope.
- Ah.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.011
Whoa!

29:59.841 --> 30:02.104
Ah!

30:09.982 --> 30:11.810
Thanks.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.260
Okay.

30:43.232 --> 30:45.931
Yes.
I got it!

30:49.151 --> 30:50.805
- Charlie!

30:53.199 --> 30:56.071
- Sara, no!

30:57.638 --> 31:00.423
- No!

31:04.297 --> 31:05.994
Sara, no!

31:18.485 --> 31:20.182
- You're bleeding.

31:20.226 --> 31:23.707
You're mortal,
just like them.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.666
Pathetic.

31:27.929 --> 31:32.107
- Apologize,
and we can heal you.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.937
We can restore order
to this madness.

31:35.981 --> 31:39.810
- I like the madness.
Sara was right.

31:41.290 --> 31:45.991
I'm no Fate.
I'm a Legend!

31:46.034 --> 31:48.297
- And now she's dead,
which makes you nothing.

31:50.691 --> 31:54.086
- Ow!

31:55.609 --> 31:57.611
You'll never find
the other pieces.

32:12.713 --> 32:15.411
No...

32:15.455 --> 32:18.501
- Once again, your humans
have let you down.

32:18.545 --> 32:21.243
Good-bye, little sister.

32:35.736 --> 32:37.651
- So, um...

32:37.694 --> 32:40.262
How are things with Nate?

32:40.306 --> 32:43.526
- Hmm, um, good.
You know.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.746
Yeah.
Super, super cool.

32:45.789 --> 32:48.183
- Weird to feel jealous
of myself.

32:48.227 --> 32:50.142
- Well, don't be too jealous.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.014
- Sorry, are you not together?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.711
- He's my brother's
best friend.

32:54.755 --> 32:57.453
It would--it would be weird.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.194
- Sorry.
He and Behrad are friends?

32:59.238 --> 33:02.589
- They have
this ridiculous handshake.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.852
It's sweet.

33:04.895 --> 33:07.202
- Behrad, a Legend.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.291
I wish I could see that.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.250
- You must be disappointed.

33:11.293 --> 33:14.035
- Yeah, I was hoping Totem-town
would have a few video games.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.646
- No, I mean
disappointed in me.

33:16.690 --> 33:17.821
- Why?

33:17.865 --> 33:19.736
- I mean, you were a superhero

33:19.780 --> 33:22.913
who wielded a totem
and saved the world,

33:22.957 --> 33:25.046
twice.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.048
I'm just
a failed Cat-Chat celebrity.

33:30.095 --> 33:33.315
- My family's alive.

33:33.359 --> 33:36.362
And you--you actually seem
like a lot of fun.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.669
I'm good with that.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.936
- They could be
anywhere out here.

33:45.980 --> 33:48.069
- Sara!
Charlie!

34:04.085 --> 34:06.479
- I thought you were dead.

34:06.522 --> 34:08.176
- Me too.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.483
- My sister--she's--
she's heading for the ship.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.853
Uh, Ava?

34:32.896 --> 34:34.115
We have a problem.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.204
There is a very slinky lady

34:36.248 --> 34:37.771
in a red leather pantsuit
on the ship,

34:37.814 --> 34:39.207
which usually I would
I would be into,

34:39.251 --> 34:40.991
but she's giving off a super

34:41.035 --> 34:43.777
" I wanna kill you in the worst
possible way" vibe.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.735
- Oh, my God.
That must be Charlie's sister.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.476
Listen, you need to wake up
Zari and get off the ship.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.738
- Already on it.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.044
- Ava, come quick!

34:53.091 --> 34:55.180
Oh, my God.

34:55.223 --> 34:56.659
- I think he's dead.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.922
- Oh!
- Don't count me out so soon,

34:58.966 --> 35:00.968
handsome.

35:01.011 --> 35:05.103
The forest is
a natural apothecary.

35:07.409 --> 35:12.197
-  Zari.
Zari!

35:12.240 --> 35:13.850
Wake up.
Wake up.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.678
Zari.
Wake up.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.289
Zari.
Zari!

35:17.332 --> 35:18.377
- Where's the ring?

35:20.901 --> 35:22.163
- Hey.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.860
Look, since you're
Charlie's sister,

35:23.904 --> 35:25.210
can't we just be cool
about all this?

35:41.835 --> 35:44.446
- You two share blood.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.448
She's your sister.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.884
- Yeah.

35:47.928 --> 35:49.582
- Pretty.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.150
I'm taking the ring.
Whether she dies is up to you.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.807
You don't belong here.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.338
No more defying Fate.

36:50.382 --> 36:51.383
- No!

37:07.268 --> 37:09.705
- Behrad.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.881
- Is he?
- Get the ship in the air.

37:11.925 --> 37:14.797
- She's still on the ship.
- Just do it!

37:26.896 --> 37:29.247
You're not getting
off this ship alive.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.295
- You saw my true form
and survived.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.428
What are you?

37:36.471 --> 37:37.777
- You're worst nightmare.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.331
- You can't kill me.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.724
I'm a god.

38:11.767 --> 38:14.161
- Yeah?
I've faced worse.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.554
Gideon, you'd better be awake,

38:15.597 --> 38:17.686
'cause I need you to open
the doors now!

38:37.402 --> 38:40.361
- Fate's a bitch, innit?

38:53.156 --> 38:55.202
Not bad.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.734
- Nice.

39:12.262 --> 39:13.394
- Come back soon.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.831
Maybe next time,
bring Behrad.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.616
- I'd like that.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.256
Oh, my God, guys.
I just had

39:49.299 --> 39:52.607
the most amazing experience.
Where's Behrad?

39:53.826 --> 39:56.002
- Z, um...

39:56.045 --> 39:57.960
- What's going on?

39:58.004 --> 39:59.440
Where is--

40:02.225 --> 40:03.879
Oh, my God.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.754
Behrad.

40:08.797 --> 40:12.540
Behrad, Behrad, joon...
Behrad.

40:16.588 --> 40:18.851
How did this happen?

40:18.894 --> 40:21.027
How did you let this happen?

40:59.587 --> 41:00.719
He's dead.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.460
- Wait, who's dead?

41:02.503 --> 41:04.592
- Behrad.

41:04.636 --> 41:05.898
You got us into this mess,

41:05.941 --> 41:08.727
and now he's dead
because of you.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.119
Can that Loom bring him back?

41:10.163 --> 41:11.599
- If we get the last piece,
yeah.

41:11.643 --> 41:12.731
- Great.
Get up, let's go.

41:12.774 --> 41:14.080
- H--hold on a second.

41:14.123 --> 41:16.038
It's not that simple,
all right?

41:16.082 --> 41:18.432
We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.521
This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.

41:20.565 --> 41:23.089
- I can handle dicey!

41:25.047 --> 41:28.094
I can handle whatever it takes
to save my brother.

41:29.574 --> 41:32.141
And until you bring him back,

41:32.185 --> 41:34.230
I am with you every minute

41:34.274 --> 41:37.146
of every damn day.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.524
- Greg, move your head.
