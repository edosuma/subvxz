WEBVTT

00:04.104 --> 00:06.105
Vance: <i>The secretary</i>
<i>of the u.S. Navy's dead.</i>

00:06.107 --> 00:09.274
Gibbs:
You ever hear of a terrorist
whack job named benham parsa?

00:09.276 --> 00:11.043
We used a hellfire missile
to destroy his compound

00:11.045 --> 00:12.044
In pakistan.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.412
He wants revenge, right?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.780
Defense believes
that parsa

00:14.782 --> 00:16.248
May have recovered the uav,

00:16.250 --> 00:17.416
Smuggled it stateside.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.218
There's a black-tie
gala event dinner--

00:19.220 --> 00:21.020
A who's who
from the intel world.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.288
Delilah wants to bring mcgee
as her plus-one.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.491
The conrad gala-- half the
counterterrorism community is

00:25.493 --> 00:28.193
There tonight, people who have
been hunting parsa for years.
Call mcgee.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.396
Tony, what's going on?
Parsa's drone wasn't destroyed.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.297
He's using it
on the conrad gala.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.733
Bishop, get me an address.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.035
Federal agents!

00:37.670 --> 00:39.571
Benham parsa,
hands above your head!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.410
Mcgee's okay. He wasn't
in the hotel when the drone hit.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.745
Delilah?
She's in surgery.
They're doing what they can.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.380
Get to work. You find him.

00:51.584 --> 00:53.652
(indistinct conversations,
distant siren wailing)

01:10.670 --> 01:12.471
Hey.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.407
Tim?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.809
It's okay.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.577
You're in the hospital.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.114
We were at the gala...

01:22.116 --> 01:24.416
What happened? What happened?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.618
There was an explosion.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.620
How many?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.789
How many people?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.658
Six dead.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.359
22 wounded.

01:34.361 --> 01:37.096
It was... It was parsa?

01:37.098 --> 01:42.634
Did you get him?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.736
(alarms beeping)
delilah? Delilah?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.505
Woman: Hanging a ringer's.
D... What's happening here?

01:46.507 --> 01:49.208
(alarms continue beeping)
bp dropping. 60/32.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.476
Get miller.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.277
Get the code team!
Man: Right away!

01:52.279 --> 01:54.179
Sir, we need to get her
into surgery.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.147
Woman 2:
She's not breathing.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.582
I'll bag her.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.183
Man: Number two,
prepped and ready!

01:58.185 --> 02:00.185
Woman: We need
two units o-neg.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.687
(text alert chimes)
text from mcgee.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.890
Delilah's back
in surgery.

02:37.892 --> 02:40.259
(sighs)
I just feel so helpless.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.793
I mean, I want
to help the little man,

02:41.795 --> 02:43.595
But I have no
idea what to do.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.231
Did you say something?
No.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.900
Are you talking to me
when you know I can't hear you

02:47.902 --> 02:50.769
To use me as some sort
of... Confessional?

02:50.771 --> 02:53.772
Are you on your third bag
of little orange things?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.708
Cheese puffs are the perfect
food to support the linkage

02:56.710 --> 02:59.244
Between new info and stuff
already stored in the brain.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.647
Just like the cheesy particles
left on the fingers

03:01.649 --> 03:03.649
Link to the cheesy taste.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.651
That makes sense.
Mm-hmm.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.319
What are you linking?

03:07.321 --> 03:08.320
(sputters)

03:08.322 --> 03:10.656
Nothing, so far.

03:10.658 --> 03:11.924
What about parsa's computers?

03:11.926 --> 03:13.325
Abby said
they were used

03:13.327 --> 03:15.327
For the drone strike only.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.461
Gave us nothing.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.964
Okay. So we go back to basics.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.499
Parsa runs
when he's threatened.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.900
Camp got hit,
ran here from pakistan.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.502
Now he feels threatened here,
might run back there.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.903
Or stay here and pretend
to run back there.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.372
Or run someplace else.
I don't like
talking this fast.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.908
Stop it.
Yeah, I... Tend
to bring that out in people.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.577
I should've warned you.
Sorry.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.378
Stop saying you're sorry,
bishop.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.280
Sign of weakness. Right.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.216
Uh, you told me that.

03:41.621 --> 03:42.821
I'll remember it now.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.623
Surviving bodyguard,

03:44.625 --> 03:45.757
He didn't know
anything.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.693
That makes sense. Um...

03:47.695 --> 03:50.896
Background suggested both men
inside the building

03:50.898 --> 03:52.698
With parsa were hired guns.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.834
It could be the same story for
the two inside the suv with him.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.269
Speaking of the
getaway car--

03:57.271 --> 03:59.438
Stolen plates, no hits
on the bolo yet.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.272
Bishop: But I did add
your description

04:00.274 --> 04:01.873
Of the guy driving.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.975
If you want to sit down with me
for a quick second,

04:02.977 --> 04:04.643
I can do a-a sketch.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.744
Or not.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.878
Grab your gear.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.815
Did you just hear
about a body telepathically?

04:09.817 --> 04:12.317
It's not a body.
It's a bullet.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.886
Bullet...?

04:24.998 --> 04:26.798
(quietly): I had so many
questions to ask him.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.800
I didn't want to interrupt
his silent thing,

04:28.802 --> 04:30.335
So I held it in.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.870
Solid choice.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.907
So we're looking
for a bullet because...

04:35.909 --> 04:38.877
It clipped the guy.
Could have dna on it.

04:38.879 --> 04:39.978
Parsa's?

04:39.980 --> 04:42.281
No. The driver.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.583
Seriously? How'd you get that?

04:44.585 --> 04:46.585
Well, it's like
<i>gorillas in the mist.</i>

04:46.587 --> 04:49.021
You'll come to
understand his grunts.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.359
Tony: Hey, where
is everybody?

04:54.361 --> 04:56.728
Priority is at the gala.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.363
They haven't
processed this yet.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.432
(sirens wailing in distance)

05:03.336 --> 05:04.336
Gibbs:
<i>Benham parsa!</i>

05:04.338 --> 05:06.338
Hands above your head!

05:14.380 --> 05:16.982
Gibbs:
Hey, bishop.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.317
Come stand here.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.384
Why?

05:19.386 --> 05:21.420
(helicopter approaching)

05:21.422 --> 05:23.355
I... I-I can do that. Okay.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.527
Put your hand up.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.095
Right there. Okay.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.030
Hold that...

05:32.032 --> 05:33.699
Right...

05:33.701 --> 05:35.734
There.

05:36.869 --> 05:37.969
Hey, I was thinking about

05:37.971 --> 05:39.638
Making mcgee
a casserole.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.972
Maybe a pot roast.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.374
You talk to him?

05:42.376 --> 05:43.575
Just text.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.577
Maybe pork chops.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.112
He likes pork chops.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.818
Beautiful.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.819
Oh, yeah.

05:53.821 --> 05:54.820
It's got to be one of these.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.054
You find it?
Hey,

05:56.056 --> 05:58.890
Go dig us up
the nearest sawzall, bishop.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.861
Wait, what?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.730
Abby:
This is the little bullet
that could, gibbs.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.931
And the reason
it could is because

06:05.933 --> 06:07.399
It distorted
when it struck the driver,

06:07.401 --> 06:09.401
Capturing dna
in the copper jacket.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.002
It lost velocity

06:11.004 --> 06:13.605
On the way, but it still
had enough to hit the door.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.941
We get a hit?
Mmm. Did we ever.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.477
Parsa's associate
is none other than...

06:18.479 --> 06:21.847
Bashir malik.
50 years old.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.383
Arrested in 2002 for
assaulting a police officer.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.851
He was born in the
states but spent

06:25.853 --> 06:28.019
His childhood in
karachi, pakistan.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.454
Parsa's hometown.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.723
Yeah, but that's not
the scary part.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.393
When I added malik's name
to the bolo, I got

06:34.395 --> 06:38.730
A response from the ncis
marine corps west field office.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.832
Pendleton has eyes on him?
Had.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.768
Malik was the suspect in

06:42.770 --> 06:44.836
The unsolved bombing
of a communications center

06:44.838 --> 06:47.973
At camp pendleton--
building 4a.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.174
The bomb didn't
completely detonate,

06:49.176 --> 06:51.510
Thank god, so there
were no casualties.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.879
That happened in April 1990.
Yeah.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.414
And that's what I meant
by scary.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.816
I mean, if we can link malik
to last night,

06:57.818 --> 07:00.419
Then it's logical he was
involved at pendleton, too.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.120
He's had over
two decades of experience.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.522
That's a long time

07:03.524 --> 07:07.192
To get very angry
and very organized.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.743
(text alert chimes)

07:37.824 --> 07:38.957
Agent mcgee.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.826
Dr. Cranston.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.227
What are you doing here?

07:42.229 --> 07:45.897
Crisis counselor for the
victims of the drone attack.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.834
You were... At the gala.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.902
I wasn't aware ncis was...

07:50.904 --> 07:52.604
I was there
with delilah fielding.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.473
She's my girlfriend.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.042
She was receiving
the conrad fellowship.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.810
Yeah.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.148
How is she?

08:04.250 --> 08:06.618
There was a lot of shrapnel.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.020
She's back in surgery

08:09.022 --> 08:10.889
With internal bleeding.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.692
She's in good hands here.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.161
And her family?

08:16.163 --> 08:19.764
Her parents are on their way
from wisconsin.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.767
I told everybody else not
to come.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.870
They need to be focused
on parsa.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.072
Of course.

08:28.808 --> 08:33.879
I can stay with you
for a while, if you like.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.680
No, I'm okay.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.115
Thank you, though.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.918
If you change your mind,
you have my number.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.160
Bashir malik.
Only child

08:49.162 --> 08:52.864
Born to a pakistani father,
american mother, both deceased.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.600
Malik was born in l.A.,
raised in pakistan,

08:55.602 --> 08:57.736
Then moved back to california
when he was 18.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.871
We usually wait
for him to say "go."

08:59.873 --> 09:01.239
I got excited.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.675
Keep going. I heard you.
Malik is in our system

09:03.677 --> 09:05.043
For assaulting an officer
in 2002.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.846
Cop mistook his car
for one involved

09:07.848 --> 09:09.915
In the abduction of a
nevada woman named keely jones.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.217
Malik got a little worked up.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.952
What about back in '90?

09:13.954 --> 09:16.154
At the time of the bombing,
malik was employed as

09:16.156 --> 09:18.924
A delivery truck driver
for wellspring fruit.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.027
He later worked his way up
to head of distribution.
Morning in question,

09:22.029 --> 09:24.095
Malik's truck was seen
near the communications center

09:24.097 --> 09:26.197
That was hit.
Nis brought him in

09:26.199 --> 09:27.832
For questioning
a bunch of times.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.901
They had an idea back then
he was their guy.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.236
Yeah, but nothing
to hold him on.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.837
He got away with it.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.073
Who knows what he's gotten away
with since.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.177
The bomb only partially
detonated but, overall, malik's

09:39.179 --> 09:40.912
Network and tactics worked,
so why change them?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.815
A-associates, mo's,
anything he used back then

09:43.817 --> 09:45.216
Could be relevant now
with parsa.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.285
Dinozzo.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.288
Yeah? Oh... Okay.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.024
Um, I already contacted
the west field office.

09:53.026 --> 09:57.162
1990 investigation was headed up
by nis agent duke turner.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.363
He spent hours
interviewing malik.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.599
Pendleton's uploading
the videos

10:00.601 --> 10:04.135
On a secure site.
If you don't mind, I'd like to
speak directly to agent turner.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.804
He might be able
to shed light on...
You can't.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.871
He's dead.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.206
Heart attack
two years ago.
Oh.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.209
His, uh, videos
and notes are all we have.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.011
Oh...
Gibbs: Okay.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.746
All right.
I'll start in.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.947
Bishop...

10:15.949 --> 10:17.716
Nsa?
Oh, uh,

10:17.718 --> 10:18.883
Clearances passed.
We can head over there now

10:18.885 --> 10:19.751
And-and swap intel with them.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.819
Oop...
Okay.

10:21.654 --> 10:22.253
Yeah.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.255
Dinozzo, get me set up

10:24.257 --> 10:25.924
With the videos before you go.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.325
Huh?

10:27.327 --> 10:30.629
Maybe you want to wait for us
to just do that. I mean...

10:30.631 --> 10:33.031
Are you sure you want to be
at the controls yourself?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.233
Start, forward, back up.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.902
I can handle it.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.071
Tony: Yeah, usually
he's like some sasquatch.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.007
(gruffly): "freeze it."
and then, uh, "slow it down."

10:42.009 --> 10:44.743
But, uh, this time,
very proficient.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.045
With the one finger but still.
Boop, boop, boop.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.813
And I'm-I'm proud of him.
Hmm.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.815
So you mean that flip
phone is by choice?

10:50.817 --> 10:51.816
Yeah.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.018
He loves
the flip phone.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.886
Wow.
Woman:
Bishop.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.155
You didn't tell me robert
redford was in the building.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.124
Hmm?
(laughs):
Oh, come on.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.026
I rarely get
the redford.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.028
You could be my debra winger,
legal eagle.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.829
I love her.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.965
Very special agent
anthony dinozzo.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.067
Hi.
What do you have for us?

11:09.069 --> 11:12.137
Uh, sounds like the interpol
summit became all about parsa.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.972
Consensus is he was
planning to bug out

11:13.974 --> 11:16.307
Directly after the drone attack.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.943
You mean leave the us.
That is the word.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.945
Ncis have a rep at the summit?

11:20.947 --> 11:23.048
Uh, director vance
is on the way now.
Yes.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.883
I'm sorry, I didn't
catch the name.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.018
Robert redford, I am very rude.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.055
Nsa senior intelligence
analyst sofia martinez.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.957
Yeah, look at that.
I got the nsa part, 'cause we're

11:32.959 --> 11:34.459
In the nsa.
(laughs)

11:34.461 --> 11:38.196
You enjoy the particulars,
very special agent.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.166
Ah, I am a man who enjoys

11:41.168 --> 11:46.271
(imitating sean connery):
As does my favorite
licensed troubleshooter.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.173
(also imitating): Bond...
Both: James bond...

11:48.175 --> 11:49.908
Thunderball.
Mm-hmm!

11:49.910 --> 11:51.076
You got the reference.

11:51.078 --> 11:55.413
To make me think
you knew something I didn't.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.115
Guys.
Hmm.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.984
Tony, martinez is a
sme for hayat parsa.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.319
You're a what?!

12:01.321 --> 12:03.755
Sme is short for
"subject matter expert."

12:03.757 --> 12:05.223
Hayat parsa...

12:05.225 --> 12:07.726
Is benham's sister in pakistan.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.260
I've been monitoring
her communications

12:09.262 --> 12:11.429
Since parsa showed up
on the radar in '07.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.431
I-I know who
hayat parsa is.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.100
Great, then
I'm sure you know

12:15.102 --> 12:17.001
Benham and hayat
were once very close.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.070
Six years later,
we've detected

12:19.072 --> 12:21.106
Very little communication
between the two of them.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.274
She still getting
calls from pay phones?
Mm-hmm,

12:23.276 --> 12:25.043
Unidentified callers,

12:25.045 --> 12:27.479
Conversations in code
we believe are about benham.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.514
Girl knows how to protect
her brother.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.316
If you could send us
reports, that'd be great.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.284
Yeah, reports'd be good.
And keep us in the loop

12:33.286 --> 12:34.486
On anything else.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.254
Mm-hmm. Sure thing,
diknows-it-all.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.789
Sure thing.
(chuckles)

12:37.791 --> 12:40.425
Excuse me.
Bye.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.160
Is she single?

12:42.162 --> 12:44.429
No. It's a bad idea.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.766
I mean, she reminds me
of someone annoying, I...

12:47.768 --> 12:49.934
I just can't
figure out who it is.
Mm.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.240
It was only my father
and me in pakistan.

12:57.309 --> 13:01.212
He taught me
to be a welder.

13:01.214 --> 13:04.516
And when he died, I realized
I wanted something more.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.553
And so I saved my money
and I came here,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.288
To america.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.123
Bashir,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.159
We both know that's
not what I asked you.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.493
Malik:
And now...

13:15.495 --> 13:17.328
I move fruit

13:17.330 --> 13:20.098
From one place
to another.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.367
It's the american dream,
is it not?

13:22.369 --> 13:25.136
Turner: I have a witness
that puts you in an alley

13:25.138 --> 13:28.072
A block from building 4a
<i>that</i> morning.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.141
Were you there or not?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.844
I was there, yes.

13:32.846 --> 13:35.346
But only to deliver fruit
to the commissary.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.516
Turner: What time?
Malik: It was early.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.918
Ducky:
Jethro.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.419
Hey, duck.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.954
You called?

13:42.956 --> 13:44.289
(sighs)

13:44.291 --> 13:46.257
Yeah.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.027
Yeah, I need you to do a profile
on this guy, bashir malik.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.028
I must say,

13:50.030 --> 13:52.230
I find it rather odd

13:52.232 --> 13:55.433
That someone of
malik's experience

13:55.435 --> 13:59.470
Would bow to a relative
newcomer like parsa.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.440
Yeah, he's different
than I thought he'd be.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.843
How so?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.911
More human.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.113
Mcgee call you?

14:09.115 --> 14:10.181
No.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.384
But tony did mention

14:13.386 --> 14:17.155
That delilah was undergoing
a second surgery.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.023
Thought that
would be done by now.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.059
Perhaps we should call him?

14:21.061 --> 14:24.195
I did. I did, I called
him and left a message.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.496
He hasn't called back.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.866
Gibbs. Hi, oh...

14:27.868 --> 14:29.868
I... I didn't mean to interrupt.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.302
But, uh,

14:31.304 --> 14:32.937
The bolo?
Yeah, what about it?

14:32.939 --> 14:34.973
Metro police found parsa's suv.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.441
Tony's gonna
meet us there.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.942
Here you go, duck.
Thanks.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.485
All right.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.560
Fbi and homeland are on the way.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.995
Anybody see anything?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.496
Witnesses heard
the explosion.

14:58.498 --> 15:02.233
By the time they
got to the alley,
it was empty.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.535
We did get a sage piece
of windshield advice.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.512
That's parsa's handwriting.

15:25.057 --> 15:27.125
Really, benham parsa?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.594
You think you can just
leave us a note and run away?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.130
I know-- how about
I write <i>you</i> a note.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.933
"dear benham parsa,
you can kiss my..."

15:34.935 --> 15:36.301
Hey, gibbs.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.535
I have things to tell you.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.570
It's why I'm here, abbs.
Okay, so

15:39.572 --> 15:41.639
We get absolutely nothing

15:41.641 --> 15:43.474
From this message,
except for further proof

15:43.476 --> 15:45.476
That parsa is a coward jerk.

15:45.478 --> 15:49.414
Now, it makes sense that parsa
would want to ditch the suv

15:49.416 --> 15:50.982
That malik picked
him up in.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.550
Well, he knew
I could I.D. Him.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.218
Plus, all the windows
are blown out,

15:54.220 --> 15:55.453
So he couldn't really
drive it anywhere

15:55.455 --> 15:56.521
Without being noticed.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.257
But why blow it up?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.626
Malik was hit. Could have
been to get rid of the blood.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.495
Cleaning up dna evidence
is one possibility.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.165
But I also found these.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.367
Two bolts that don't
match the factory specs

16:09.369 --> 16:10.601
For this model suv.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.570
I'm just thinking
that maybe

16:12.572 --> 16:14.706
There was some other
object inside the vehicle

16:14.708 --> 16:18.076
When it blew up.
I'm still trying to
figure out what it was.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.511
Mcgee.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.980
I'm so glad you're here,

16:21.982 --> 16:25.116
And so not hurt.
And so...

16:25.118 --> 16:27.285
Mchuggable.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.686
Thanks, abby.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.521
How's delilah, tim?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.223
Uh, they stopped
the bleeding.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.359
She's in recovery,
her parents are there now.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.128
Good. Glad she's okay.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.563
You should go home.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.697
Get some rest.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.699
No, I'm... I'm good, boss.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.368
Hey, mcgee, um,

16:43.370 --> 16:47.105
Do you think delilah would
mind if I stopped by?

16:47.107 --> 16:51.242
Sister rosita taught me, like,
20 hospital-friendly ways

16:51.244 --> 16:52.543
To entertain patients.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.645
All I need is a hula hoop
and a glass of water.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.648
Abby, I'll let you know as soon
as she's ready for visitors.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.517
Okay. Yay.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.456
Sure you're okay?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.258
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.763
(clears throat)

17:11.765 --> 17:13.664
Thought maybe you could
give me a quick brief

17:13.666 --> 17:15.566
And then I can go over
everything bishop's got

17:15.568 --> 17:17.168
On the floor upstairs.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.470
And then I can update
you with a direction.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.740
I don't need you up and running
in the next five minutes, tim.
No, I know.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.743
But I'm here to work.
I'm ready to work.

17:25.745 --> 17:29.280
Well, I still need your
"fitness for duty" eval

17:29.282 --> 17:30.782
Before you do anything.

17:30.784 --> 17:34.218
Well, I talked
to dr. Cranston
at the hospital.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.454
I still need
the paperwork, tim.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.624
So go talk to her again.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.300
23 years is more than
a stroll around the block.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.469
Good bet whatever nis recorded
in my statement back then

17:51.471 --> 17:54.806
Is more accurate than
what I could tell you now.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.408
Yeah. Looking at
a different angle.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.611
Things can get lost in reports.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.181
It's whatever
you can remember, top.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.417
I was out for a run.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.853
Early morning.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.289
Still dark.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.191
I passed the commissary,

18:13.193 --> 18:14.492
Saw a truck.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.827
Produce truck.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.361
Don't remember
the name.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.163
Wellspring fruit.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.832
That was it.

18:20.834 --> 18:24.435
Statement said that the truck
location stuck out to you.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.404
Mm-hmm.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.706
It was parked in
the side alley.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.476
Front of the building is where
they unloaded, not the side.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.744
What'd you see?

18:33.746 --> 18:37.381
Bashir malik.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.884
Learned his name later,
never forgot it.

18:39.886 --> 18:43.621
He was exiting the
truck when I passed.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.623
In my mind,

18:45.625 --> 18:48.392
He parked there because
he never made a delivery.

18:48.394 --> 18:52.263
He walked down
the alley to 4a,

18:52.265 --> 18:54.165
Planted the bomb, drove off.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.467
Why are you back
into this, gunny?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.370
It could be relevant
to a current threat.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.139
Malik?

19:02.808 --> 19:05.243
I kept tabs on him.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.612
Only time his name came
back to me was in '02.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.813
Yeah, I know.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.381
Arrested for assaulting
a police officer.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.351
He was pulled over
for driving a car

19:13.353 --> 19:16.187
Like the one keely jones
was last seen in.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.490
Nothing stuck.
But I thought...

19:19.492 --> 19:21.626
A man crazy enough
to plant a bomb

19:21.628 --> 19:24.695
Would probably have no qualms

19:24.697 --> 19:26.931
About abducting a woman.

19:43.549 --> 19:44.882
Perspective?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.685
Oh, hi. Yeah.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.253
Yeah, um, exactly, I thought

19:49.255 --> 19:51.422
A different angle might help.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.424
Rachel cranston.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.425
You're the doctor.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.893
Here for a house call.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.562
Is, um, agent mcgee...

19:57.564 --> 19:59.564
Uh, director's office
was the only space available.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.798
He's there waiting for you.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.266
Thank you.

20:02.268 --> 20:04.402
Mm-hmm.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.605
In case you hadn't heard,
that's a really good desk.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.407
Oh. Yeah, I-I know.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.608
I mean...

20:10.610 --> 20:11.842
I heard. I...

20:11.844 --> 20:14.478
Did you know the agent
who sat here before?

20:14.480 --> 20:15.947
I knew both of them.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.615
Well...

20:17.617 --> 20:19.884
You don't have to tell me.
It's pretty clear

20:19.886 --> 20:23.287
I'm looking at
some gigantic shoes.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.355
Unfillable.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.290
True.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.960
But I think both women who sat
there would say the same thing.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.461
When it comes to growing,

20:30.463 --> 20:32.930
There's no better
place for a desk

20:32.932 --> 20:35.399
Than next to these three.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.540
(phone ringing)

20:44.543 --> 20:45.543
Bishop.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.844
Hey. It's martinez.

20:46.846 --> 20:47.945
Got something interesting.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.347
Can you secure video conference?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.482
Uh, for sure, yeah.
Just give me a second.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.993
Martinez:
Listen, I've been wracking
my brain since you left.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.828
That guy you were with,

21:03.830 --> 21:05.963
He reminds me of someone
<i>so</i> annoying, but

21:05.965 --> 21:08.432
I just can't think of who.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.501
Um... You?

21:10.503 --> 21:11.936
Me.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.804
The movie references,
the nicknames,

21:13.806 --> 21:17.541
It's like you guys are cut
from the same weird cloth.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.410
Please don't tell me that's
what you called to talk about.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.546
No, I have something
for you, but...

21:22.548 --> 21:23.914
You didn't have to bring
your whole desk with you.

21:23.916 --> 21:24.915
Oh!

21:24.917 --> 21:26.050
Hello.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.752
Oh. Hello.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.520
Again. I heard
you picked up

21:29.522 --> 21:31.489
Something on your whisper 2000.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.025
Well, while you were busy
coming up with that one,

21:34.027 --> 21:35.860
I was busy
monitoring a phone call

21:35.862 --> 21:38.062
Hayat parsa received
from an unidentified caller

21:38.064 --> 21:39.630
On a pay phone.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.500
Now, during that conversation
she rattled off

21:42.502 --> 21:43.601
A series of numbers.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.702
What were they?

21:44.704 --> 21:47.872
180, 60, 45.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.307
Does that mean anything to you?

21:49.309 --> 21:50.908
Not off the top of my head.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.477
What's the context?
Martinez:
Well, like I told you before,

21:53.479 --> 21:55.946
These pay-phone calls
are in code.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.548
But it does seem significant.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.984
She's mentioned these numbers
several times, saying,

21:59.986 --> 22:02.920
Quote, "it's not enough."

22:02.922 --> 22:04.822
Hmm. Enough what?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.358
180, 60, 45.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.393
It's got to mean something.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.532
Mcgee:
<i>I was outside on the phone</i>
<i>when it happened.</i>

22:14.534 --> 22:17.335
You were fortunate.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.670
Right. Well, I just mean,

22:19.672 --> 22:22.573
As far as what I saw,
it could have been worse.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.975
What about delilah?

22:24.977 --> 22:27.712
What she saw?
No.

22:27.714 --> 22:31.048
What you felt about
her being inside.

22:32.984 --> 22:36.020
She was one of the first people
they got out of the building.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.657
It wasn't long before I knew
she was going to be okay.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.560
Honestly, I'm-I'm fine.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.595
She's fine.
I'm ready to work.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.997
"and miles to go
before I sleep."

22:48.533 --> 22:50.434
What are you writing?

22:50.436 --> 22:51.736
I'm writing that you're giving

22:51.738 --> 22:53.637
The perfect responses, tim.

22:53.639 --> 22:56.006
Is that a problem?

22:56.008 --> 22:58.676
Well, I'd rather
hear the real ones.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.913
These <i>are</i> the real ones.

23:02.915 --> 23:06.517
Is it just me that you're
shutting out, or is it everyone?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.759
If my answers were good...

23:14.761 --> 23:17.461
I just need your signature.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.463
Malik: Did you check
with the commissary?

23:19.465 --> 23:21.432
Turner: You know I checked
with the commissary.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.801
Malik: Then you saw
I delivered the fruit.

23:23.803 --> 23:27.638
I could not have planted a bomb
and unloaded all of that fruit

23:27.640 --> 23:29.673
In 15 minutes.
It's common sense, no?

23:29.675 --> 23:30.941
Turner: Why were you parked
in the alley?

23:30.943 --> 23:33.444
Unloading is out front.
Malik: I told you.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.678
It was my first time
delivering there.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.147
Records have you
there twice before.

23:36.149 --> 23:37.748
Malik: What records?
Your records are wrong.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.750
Turner: You knew unloading
was out front.

23:39.752 --> 23:40.751
Malik:
I didn't!

23:40.753 --> 23:41.719
Turner:
Why were you in the alley?

23:41.721 --> 23:43.053
Malik:
Sir...

23:43.055 --> 23:44.522
I am not a terrorist.

23:44.524 --> 23:47.691
I just move things
from one place to another.

23:47.693 --> 23:50.961
I would appreciate

23:50.963 --> 23:53.664
If you treated me
with some respect.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.602
Sir...!
I am not a terrorist.

23:58.604 --> 24:02.506
I just move things
from one place to another.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.775
Gibbs:
<i>Malik moves things, duck.</i>

24:04.777 --> 24:06.811
That's his job.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.779
I don't follow you.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.781
He delivered the fruit, duck,

24:10.783 --> 24:13.651
While someone else
planted the bomb.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.619
Oh, that's a clever theory.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.822
The alley would be
the perfect place

24:17.824 --> 24:21.859
For the bomber to enter
in the back of the truck unseen.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.795
What proof do we have?
2002.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.466
Malik's car matches one
that keely jones was in.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.867
Her husband was abusive.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.836
He never would have let her go.

24:31.838 --> 24:35.873
You believe that malik
was taking her to safety?

24:35.875 --> 24:39.210
He moves whoever pays him.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.212
Parsa.

24:41.214 --> 24:44.782
Transportation is
malik's specialty.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.651
He has taken great
pride in building up

24:47.653 --> 24:51.222
This far-reaching network,
which he uses for distribution.

24:51.224 --> 24:53.791
Or escape routes?
Precisely.

24:53.793 --> 24:58.863
If malik made the
pendleton bomber vanish,

24:58.865 --> 25:00.798
Then there's
a very real possibility

25:00.800 --> 25:04.768
That parsa is also gone
for good.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.682
Mcgee, you're back.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.784
Yup. Paperwork came through
this morning.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.154
Fantastic! Awesome!

25:24.156 --> 25:25.856
Well, hey, I'm, uh...

25:25.858 --> 25:27.825
I'm glad
that delilah's doing better.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.627
That was...

25:29.629 --> 25:32.863
You know that casserole
I was talking about. I made it.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.765
I can drop it
by after work.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.667
Thank you, but I'm okay.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.936
Well, I want to.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.738
You know, at my
men's health group,

25:40.740 --> 25:42.640
They talk about, uh...

25:42.642 --> 25:44.542
Well, it's important
to be sensitive

25:44.544 --> 25:45.809
During sensitive
times, and, so...

25:45.811 --> 25:47.711
I could make you pork chops.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.547
Pork chops?

25:49.549 --> 25:50.581
I heard "pork chops."

25:50.583 --> 25:51.715
It's kind of early,

25:51.717 --> 25:53.584
But I'm in.

25:53.586 --> 25:54.318
Let's go. Update.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.820
Gibbs, good morning.

25:56.822 --> 25:58.622
I know you guys skip

25:58.624 --> 26:01.759
The greetings, but it just
feels kind of weird.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.694
So, we're operating based
on the theory

26:03.696 --> 26:05.930
That bashir malik was hired
to make parsa disappear.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.332
Malik's bank records
support that.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.301
They show a series
of cash deposits

26:10.303 --> 26:11.835
Beginning two months
after keely jones.

26:11.837 --> 26:14.071
Same thing after pendleton.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.806
Deposits were small and
irregular to avoid suspicion.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.875
Thanks to his time

26:17.877 --> 26:19.009
With wellspring fruit,

26:19.011 --> 26:20.878
Malik is an expert
in distribution routes.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.012
He's developed relationships
with trucks,

26:22.014 --> 26:23.714
Trains and cargo planes.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.649
Fbi and homeland are
checking out his contacts,

26:25.651 --> 26:26.784
But so far, nothing.

26:26.786 --> 26:27.785
(phone ringing)

26:27.787 --> 26:31.055
Gibbs, can you come to the lab?
Sure. Be right down.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.724
Dinozzo, bishop, check in

26:33.726 --> 26:34.959
Again with fbi
and homeland.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.094
Oh, and I'm still working
on those numbers

26:37.096 --> 26:39.830
From hayat parsa.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.333
Hey. You're all caught up.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.867
Yeah, almost.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.002
I got in early.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.737
Dr. Cranston signed my rec.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.839
There's a few more
cross-references

26:48.841 --> 26:50.341
I want to run between parsa

26:50.343 --> 26:52.343
And malik...
Tim?

26:52.345 --> 26:54.912
Take it easy.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.880
Sure, boss.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.988
(camera shutter clicking)

27:03.990 --> 27:05.923
Oh, sorry...

27:05.925 --> 27:08.959
Um, I know rule 62 is to
always give people space

27:08.961 --> 27:10.661
When they get
off the elevator,

27:10.663 --> 27:11.929
But this is
really important.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.163
I don't want to
waste any time.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.898
What is, abbs?

27:14.900 --> 27:16.166
I think I know
why parsa blew up the suv.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.002
He didn't want us to know
it was modified.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.270
It was modified? How?
Well, at first I thought

27:20.272 --> 27:21.839
That these bolts belonged
to something that

27:21.841 --> 27:25.809
But then I found more mounted
to the undercarriage.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.814
(sighs)

27:31.883 --> 27:33.817
Can you see 'em?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.186
Oh, they're right there
next to where the gas tank was.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.188
If there was a gas tank, which

27:38.190 --> 27:39.957
There wasn't.
At least

27:39.959 --> 27:42.793
Not where
it was supposed to be. Oh.

27:42.795 --> 27:43.761
Gotcha.

27:43.763 --> 27:47.765
I mean, considering the
amount of damage done

27:47.767 --> 27:50.167
To the sides of the
suv from the blast,

27:50.169 --> 27:52.936
It's likely that the
gas tank was split

27:52.938 --> 27:54.838
And then relocated
into the doors.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.973
And in the void

27:55.975 --> 27:57.841
That was left...

27:59.778 --> 28:01.378
He made a hiding place.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.948
Exactly. The compartment
was anchored by the bolts,

28:04.950 --> 28:06.684
And it's approximately
six feet by two feet

28:06.686 --> 28:07.851
By one-and-a-half feet.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.354
That's big enough
to hide a person, gibbs.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.089
Mcgee:
<i>Boss...</i>

28:12.091 --> 28:14.258
The compartment suggests
parsa was planning

28:14.260 --> 28:17.127
On passing some kind
of checkpoint in the suv.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.863
I've already alerted mexican and
canadian border authorities.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.932
Well, a checkpoint
could mean anything.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.300
You know, the car
would be searched

28:23.302 --> 28:24.902
If it were being shipped
overseas by boat or air freight.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.237
You know, boss,
this whole thing seems

28:27.239 --> 28:29.873
Counterintuitive.
I mean, parsa has millions.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.009
You'd think he'd find
a more sophisticated way

28:32.011 --> 28:33.110
Than a hiding spot.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.812
You'd think.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.013
It's exactly why
he went grass roots,

28:36.015 --> 28:37.381
Hired an old master.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.149
Yeah, but now,
since they ditched the car,

28:39.151 --> 28:41.285
It's just as likely they changed
their plan all together.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.053
They use the metric
system in pakistan?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.955
What?
(groans)

28:45.857 --> 28:48.959
Dinozzo.
She rubbing off on you?

28:48.961 --> 28:50.294
(grunts, sighs)

28:50.296 --> 28:52.763
What were the dimensions
of the compartment?

28:52.765 --> 28:53.464
(typing rapidly)

28:53.466 --> 28:55.432
Approximately...

28:55.434 --> 28:57.501
Six by two by one-and-a-half.

28:57.503 --> 29:00.437
Convert that to centimeters,
it's... What?

29:00.439 --> 29:01.872
(typing)

29:01.874 --> 29:05.275
About 180 by 60 by 45.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.244
The numbers hayat said
on the phone.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.046
She said,
"it's not enough."

29:09.048 --> 29:10.981
She was worried the compartment
space was too small.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.816
She knew
how parsa was getting out.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.118
Cia already has operatives
embedded in karachi.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.986
They can grab her.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.388
No. By the time we break her,
her intel would be irrelevant.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.758
Hayat wouldn't turn
without a fight.

29:20.760 --> 29:24.428
Bottom line, her loyalty
to benham could be unbreakable.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.331
Okay. So, we use it.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.399
Cia officer:
<i>Sitrep is as follows:</i>

29:29.401 --> 29:33.170
Per the joint agenda, at 22:32
pkt, our embedded agent j...

29:33.172 --> 29:35.539
Hold on. Just one minute.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.040
One minute, please.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.042
Updating the director
and secnav.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.277
He's coming.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.079
Go ahead.
We're ready.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.214
Per the joint agenda,
at 22:32 pkt,

29:44.216 --> 29:46.784
Our embedded agent j approached
the home of hayat parsa.

29:46.786 --> 29:49.052
His objective: To convince her
that benham parsa's

29:49.054 --> 29:51.288
Escape went awry,
leaving him in imminent danger.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.090
Did she bite?

29:53.092 --> 29:54.491
Since agent j
left the premises,

29:54.493 --> 29:56.226
Approximately eight minutes
have passed,

29:56.228 --> 29:57.427
With sources on the ground
reporting no movement

29:57.429 --> 29:59.062
Into or out of the house.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.532
If she were gonna make
an impulsive move,

30:01.534 --> 30:03.000
She would've done it already.

30:03.002 --> 30:06.069
Mm-mm. Mmm.
She's analytical.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.938
I guarantee
she's thinking this through.

30:07.940 --> 30:11.175
So... We've got to be patient.

30:12.544 --> 30:15.445
(bishop sighs)

30:17.982 --> 30:19.316
Ah. Gibbs.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.018
Hey, doc, I can't
talk right now.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.152
No. It's important.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.054
It's about mcgee.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.890
What? You signed his rec?

30:26.892 --> 30:29.092
Did he talk to
you about delilah?

30:29.094 --> 30:31.061
He said she's fine.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.297
Gibbs, I just spoke
to the family.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.333
There were complications
during the surgery yesterday.

30:36.335 --> 30:40.337
A piece of shrapnel
transected her spinal cord.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.472
She's paralyzed.

30:45.109 --> 30:48.512
Does mcgee know that?
Since yesterday.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.013
Delilah's mother said
he was inconsolable

30:50.015 --> 30:51.281
After they heard the news.

30:51.283 --> 30:55.085
He left the hospital
before she even woke up.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.254
Gibbs, this level of
avoidance could be

30:57.256 --> 30:58.989
Diagnostically significant.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.557
I need to talk to him.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.126
Gibbs, we're on.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.932
I'll send him out to you, doc.

31:19.911 --> 31:22.012
Hayat just made
an outgoing call.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.448
U.S. Country code.
Nsa jurisdiction is foreign.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.582
I'm on the trace.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.051
Patching the call through.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.053
Man: Who is this?
Hayat:
Tell me what went wrong.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.122
Positive I.D. On hayat's voice.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.558
The number she dialed isn't
in the database.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.193
Hayat:
...To call this for emergency.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.160
Mcgee:
It's a burn phone.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.362
Signal's bouncing all over.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.596
Call's gonna be short.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.298
Mcgee:
We're almost there.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.566
Looks local.
Man:
I'm doing my part.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.269
Hayat:
I was told something went wrong!

31:45.271 --> 31:47.237
He is in danger.
Man:
I am doing my part.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.940
The move is underway.
That's malik.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.609
Talk to us, mcgee.
I'm almost there.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.045
Another occupant is
approaching the front door.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.446
She's gonna hang up.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.081
Hayat:
Something is wrong.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.950
Get rid of everything now!

31:59.952 --> 32:01.184
Wait...

32:02.353 --> 32:05.389
All right, I got it.
433 hope street southeast.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.024
Industrial district.

32:07.026 --> 32:07.925
Hayat:
Someone is coming.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.393
(hangs up)

32:09.395 --> 32:11.061
Have fbi and homeland
meet us there.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.129
Okay.

32:14.032 --> 32:18.502
Mcgee, dr. Cranston's waiting
outside for you.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.220
(clattering in distance)

32:53.104 --> 32:54.604
Federal agents!

32:54.606 --> 32:56.506
Gibbs: Hands in the air!
Get away from the barrel!

32:56.508 --> 32:58.208
Don't move!

32:58.210 --> 33:00.077
My hands are up.
You have me.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.611
You have me!
You have me!

33:01.613 --> 33:03.347
Tony:
Turn around! Back to me!

33:03.349 --> 33:04.681
Put your hands down.

33:05.717 --> 33:09.186
This is ncis.
We have bashir malik in custody.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.754
Check the rest of
the place for parsa.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.489
Where is he?

33:13.758 --> 33:16.126
Where is parsa?

33:16.128 --> 33:18.528
Where is parsa!

33:39.684 --> 33:41.618
Something going on
with mcgee, boss?

33:41.620 --> 33:44.321
Get him to interrogation.

33:44.323 --> 33:46.456
I spoke to him,

33:46.458 --> 33:48.492
And the minute I mentioned
delilah, he became

33:48.494 --> 33:50.627
Highly agitated
and left.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.130
I have to rescind
my recommendation, gibbs.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.499
He cannot be at work right now.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.800
Are you sure, doc?

33:56.802 --> 33:58.301
If he's triggered,

33:58.303 --> 34:00.404
His judgment could be impaired.

34:00.406 --> 34:03.473
You got any idea where he went?
No.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.275
And going after him
will just make it worse.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.676
He... He's not in a spiral.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.113
He just needs
to process this on his own.

34:10.115 --> 34:12.382
And we need
to let him.

34:24.429 --> 34:28.465
(sighs) we need to find
another direction.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.600
We're gonna lose parsa.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.103
We're gonna lose him again.

34:33.105 --> 34:36.807
(sighs) we're gonna
get this guy to talk.

34:36.809 --> 34:38.642
Granted, the ones
with the combed hair

34:38.644 --> 34:40.710
Usually take a
little longer, but...

34:40.712 --> 34:42.312
Gibbs'll bring him around.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.081
Malik didn't break back in '90.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.116
What makes you think
this time'll be any different?

34:46.118 --> 34:50.187
Well, we did catch him
cleaning out a terrorist lair.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.189
He's got no family.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.657
All he cares about
is his work.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.093
We have zero leverage
to make him give up parsa.

34:56.095 --> 34:57.394
Take it easy, bishop.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.595
Here he comes.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.430
Watch and learn.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.432
(sighs):
No. I need to be doing.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.835
I'm gonna go help abby
with documents.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.876
The warehouse
was his headquarters.

35:14.812 --> 35:17.681
I was responsible for the exit,

35:17.683 --> 35:19.549
Not the endpoint.

35:19.551 --> 35:23.186
Part of the exit meant
that everything must go.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.322
Like the commercials, huh?

35:25.324 --> 35:27.858
"everything must go."

35:27.860 --> 35:32.395
I didn't stop to read the
documents before I burned them.

35:32.397 --> 35:35.132
Documents weren't
the question.

35:35.134 --> 35:38.401
You want to know
where is parsa.

35:38.403 --> 35:41.304
I told you,
I don't know.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.241
Where'd you take him?

35:44.243 --> 35:47.611
Sir, don't look at me that way.

35:47.613 --> 35:50.847
I am not a terrorist.

35:50.849 --> 35:54.217
I just move things
from one place to another.

35:54.219 --> 35:57.821
I know about you
moving things, bashir.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.424
I know about your remodeled car.

36:01.426 --> 36:04.361
I know about pendleton.

36:04.363 --> 36:07.230
Pendleton...
Was a long time ago.

36:07.232 --> 36:08.465
Yeah.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.367
You think that changes
who you are?

36:10.369 --> 36:12.536
All this time
I have done a job,

36:12.538 --> 36:14.938
And I have done it
to perfection.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.340
The years, they come and go,
and I move people--

36:17.342 --> 36:19.342
People you don't know about,
people you can't imagine--

36:19.344 --> 36:21.545
And yet you judge me
based on two?

36:21.547 --> 36:24.548
You're damn right I judge you!
This is what

36:24.550 --> 36:26.249
You helped.

36:26.251 --> 36:29.419
Judge my work alone.
This is what
you moved.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.388
My father was nothing,
and I am a success.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.256
You are the same as parsa.

36:33.258 --> 36:34.658
Sir, I am not!

36:34.660 --> 36:36.726
Prove it.

36:38.596 --> 36:41.798
(quietly):
Sir, I am not a terrorist.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.801
I just move things...

36:44.803 --> 36:48.338
From one place
to another.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.775
You want me
to take a crack?

36:51.777 --> 36:53.476
Where's abby with the documents?

36:53.478 --> 36:55.579
They're burned up pretty bad;
could take days

36:55.581 --> 36:58.448
To get anything useful.
This guy's the best thing
we got going for us.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.584
Go help abby.
You okay, boss?

37:00.586 --> 37:02.819
I need time to think.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.496
(slaps folder onto desk)

37:17.568 --> 37:18.868
Boss?

37:18.870 --> 37:21.304
Hey, tim. I...

37:21.306 --> 37:22.872
I don't want to talk about it.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.575
I just came here to tell you
I want to work,

37:25.577 --> 37:26.977
I deserve to work.

37:26.979 --> 37:28.812
I can't have you here like this.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.347
I've done everything

37:30.349 --> 37:32.349
You've asked me to do
since I got back.

37:32.351 --> 37:35.285
I traced that call, boss;
I traced it fast.
I know.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.520
Am I doing my job or not?

37:37.522 --> 37:40.790
You're more important
than the job, tim.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.492
(wry laugh)

37:42.494 --> 37:43.994
No, I'm not.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.796
Because it should have
been you instead of her?

37:46.798 --> 37:48.531
You couldn't have
known, tim.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.834
It was my job to know;
parsa was my job.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.503
<i>Our</i> job, tim.

37:53.505 --> 37:54.838
He was our job, not yours.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.673
<i>Ours.</i>

37:56.675 --> 38:01.611
We tried like hell to know
in time, but we didn't.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.947
I don't know how
to talk to her.

38:07.385 --> 38:10.387
I will go back
to the hospital with you.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.956
No, no, this is something
I have to figure out on my own.

38:12.958 --> 38:16.559
I just... I can't
do it right now.

38:16.561 --> 38:18.995
Please, just
let me do my job.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.803
Tim...

38:28.739 --> 38:30.807
Just talk.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.979
Just tell her the truth.

38:46.857 --> 38:48.858
Truth is...

38:48.860 --> 38:51.494
This man almost got put away

38:51.496 --> 38:54.831
For helping keely jones.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.634
Her husband was beating her.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.603
I moved her to a new life.

39:00.605 --> 39:04.641
Truth is, things
aren't black-and-white.

39:04.643 --> 39:07.844
If I tell you what I know...

39:07.846 --> 39:11.348
That's all
I'll be remembered for.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.784
Mm-hmm, maybe.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.920
But you'll be doing
what's right.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.791
Truth is, I know
that that matters to you.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.527
Doesn't it?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.836
Parsa...

39:32.838 --> 39:35.071
Was hidden in a car.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.609
I smuggled him...

39:39.611 --> 39:41.478
Onto a freight train
in baltimore

39:41.480 --> 39:43.880
That transports automobiles.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.015
I was to move
his bodyguard as well,

39:46.017 --> 39:48.485
But as you know,
things happened.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.921
I only had one car
left to work with.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.924
The bodyguard had
to find his own way.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.993
To where?

39:58.496 --> 40:00.730
The train...

40:00.732 --> 40:02.999
Was going to miami,

40:03.001 --> 40:07.971
But parsa was to de-board
along the way.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.540
For my own safety,
I don't know where.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.009
All I know is...

40:13.011 --> 40:16.112
He is gone.

40:18.549 --> 40:21.584
Promise me
you will try.

40:21.586 --> 40:25.054
When the reporters come.

40:25.056 --> 40:28.124
Tell them I'm not a terrorist.

40:30.561 --> 40:32.962
(picks up sheet of paper)

40:34.698 --> 40:36.766
(monitor beeping steadily)

40:46.577 --> 40:49.846
I should have been here
when you woke up.

40:51.615 --> 40:54.184
You're here now.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.029
So we know parsa was
on a train en route to miami.

41:06.031 --> 41:08.064
Homeland's been notified.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.467
Bodyguard was supposed to meet
him somewhere along the way.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.068
I'm gonna check
the train route.

41:20.544 --> 41:21.611
(phone beeps, clicks shut)

41:23.614 --> 41:25.682
(monitor beeping steadily)

41:44.869 --> 41:47.737
Her family wanted some time.

41:50.040 --> 41:54.077
If it's okay, I'm gonna
come in tomorrow and...

41:54.079 --> 41:56.179
Tell the others what happened.

41:58.148 --> 42:00.750
Whenever you're ready, tim.

42:04.622 --> 42:07.257
Boss, would you mind
sitting with me?
