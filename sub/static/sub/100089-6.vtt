WEBVTT

00:01.429 --> 00:03.140
I can't believe the kids won't tell us

00:03.195 --> 00:04.797
what they're going as this year.

00:04.829 --> 00:07.498
Like, I'm having the shin-sweats
just thinking about it.

00:07.532 --> 00:09.273
Must be a group thing
with the five of them.

00:09.338 --> 00:10.440
But nothing obvious.

00:10.473 --> 00:12.509
Rory can't stand first-thought ideas.

00:12.543 --> 00:15.419
Don't even get him started on
the name "Cheesecake Factory."

00:15.474 --> 00:16.480
Well, let's see.

00:16.512 --> 00:18.549
We have three girls and two boys.

00:18.582 --> 00:20.933
I don't even know why I'm trying
to figure it out.

00:20.958 --> 00:22.986
I really could not care less.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.181
All right, Miggy,
you're sure you're good

00:24.220 --> 00:25.408
to hand out Halloween candy at my house?

00:25.447 --> 00:26.567
It's a big job.

00:26.622 --> 00:28.325
You gotta keep it spooky,

00:28.358 --> 00:30.928
which is an acronym for "Scary,"
"Paranormal," "Oh, no,"

00:30.961 --> 00:32.830
"Oh, God," "Keep that thing
away from me," "Yay!"

00:32.863 --> 00:34.265
Chill. I get it.

00:34.297 --> 00:36.800
I open the door, I hand out
candy, I close the door.

00:36.833 --> 00:38.269
Jack and I got it covered.

00:40.370 --> 00:43.306
You made him the volleyball
from "Cast Away"?

00:43.339 --> 00:44.485
Yeah, I wanted someone to talk to.

00:44.532 --> 00:46.976
Miggy, you can talk to your son
when he's in regular clothes.

00:47.010 --> 00:48.778
- We're ready! Here we come!
- Oh.

00:52.648 --> 00:55.719
Are... Are you guys j-jury duty?

00:58.020 --> 01:00.456
Oh, God. They're us.

01:00.489 --> 01:02.492
I sell books about wine.

01:02.525 --> 01:03.927
More or less, yeah.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.862
I have a law job and I drive a minivan.

01:05.895 --> 01:07.297
Cool. She gave me two things.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.098
I'm 10 feet tall.

01:09.132 --> 01:10.512
You know, I couldn't even buy jeans

01:10.559 --> 01:12.430
until the Internet was invented.

01:12.455 --> 01:14.939
I hate sand in my shoes
but like keeping my baby alive.

01:14.972 --> 01:17.270
Yo, this is like "SNL"!

01:17.317 --> 01:20.276
Could someone be a mensch
and pass the schmear?

01:22.546 --> 01:23.781
I don't get it. That's not me.

01:23.814 --> 01:25.014
Okay, that's you.

01:25.047 --> 01:27.183
Yeah, but why is she doing me Jewish?

01:27.216 --> 01:28.284
You aren't Jewish?

01:28.317 --> 01:29.385
No.

01:29.418 --> 01:30.453
It's your essence, though.

01:31.555 --> 01:33.357
I always get my own schmear.

01:36.592 --> 01:38.562
02x06 - <i>Welcome to Hell, Sickos!</i>

01:39.730 --> 01:41.198
Look.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.167
I just put the finishing touches
on our pumpkin.

01:43.199 --> 01:44.567
Oh, this looks great.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.535
Everybody, check it out.

01:45.568 --> 01:47.171
It's Ruth Bader Ginsburg

01:47.204 --> 01:49.473
shoulder-pressing two smaller
Ruth Bader Ginsburgs

01:49.505 --> 01:51.659
shoulder-pressing even more
Ruth Bader Ginsburgs.

01:51.721 --> 01:52.743
It's a fractal.

01:52.776 --> 01:55.079
Oh. Everything's gotta be something now.

01:55.112 --> 01:57.248
Oh, which reminds me,
before anybody moves,

01:57.281 --> 02:00.017
can you all wave hi to Tracy
for her birthday video?

02:00.049 --> 02:01.751
- Hey.
- Happy birthday.

02:01.785 --> 02:03.178
Hi. Awesome. Thank you.

02:03.203 --> 02:04.413
Sophie, I want you to tell everybody

02:04.454 --> 02:06.772
I want butts in seats and
pumpkins on laps in five minutes.

02:06.797 --> 02:08.568
Okay, wait, so, it's Tracy's birthday?

02:08.594 --> 02:10.060
Yeah, she's having a party

02:10.092 --> 02:11.780
at some weird bar
called The Padded Cell.

02:11.819 --> 02:13.263
She's got family coming in from Poland.

02:13.297 --> 02:14.965
No, they are not bringing sausage,

02:14.997 --> 02:16.733
and, yes, it was offensive to ask.

02:16.767 --> 02:19.136
Oof. Caught between your
girlfriend and your kid?

02:19.168 --> 02:20.136
It's been totally fine.

02:20.169 --> 02:21.437
I went to her directly, and I said,

02:21.471 --> 02:22.907
"Are you okay with me
missing your party?"

02:22.940 --> 02:24.140
And she said, "Yes."

02:24.174 --> 02:25.810
Hey, you know I want to be
at your birthday,

02:25.842 --> 02:26.976
but it's Halloween.

02:27.009 --> 02:28.679
That's okay, right?

02:28.711 --> 02:29.646
Yaiyse.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.248
Oh, honey.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.517
"Yaiyse" is not a yes.

02:33.549 --> 02:36.519
When there are that many letters
in the word "yes," it's a no.

02:36.553 --> 02:38.823
- So, you think she's upset?
- Ya.

02:38.855 --> 02:39.924
See how few letters my "yes" had in it?

02:39.956 --> 02:41.257
That's how sure I am.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.859
Aw, man. I thought I was balancing

02:42.893 --> 02:44.527
the whole kid-girlfriend thing
perfectly.

02:44.561 --> 02:46.130
All right, look, the trick is

02:46.162 --> 02:48.666
that you have to make Tracy
feel like she is a priority,

02:48.698 --> 02:50.967
even though this is the most
important night in the kid year.

02:51.001 --> 02:53.771
It's like in
"The American President," right?

02:53.804 --> 02:55.271
The country comes first,

02:55.305 --> 02:58.042
but Andy still can't
completely screw over Sydney.

02:58.074 --> 02:59.853
Okay. So, how does that...

02:59.884 --> 03:01.645
Girl, that is one of my favorite movies.

03:01.678 --> 03:02.829
You want to watch a scene
real quick on my phone?

03:02.854 --> 03:03.773
Uh, yes.

03:06.682 --> 03:08.285
Well, that's women for ya.

03:08.317 --> 03:09.819
You know, they're quick
to point out a problem,

03:09.853 --> 03:11.322
and then when you need a solution,

03:11.354 --> 03:13.723
they're watching Michael Douglas
on their phones.

03:13.757 --> 03:14.992
Okay, I need to figure this out.

03:15.025 --> 03:17.294
I think I can actually
make it to Tracy's party,

03:17.327 --> 03:18.628
drop in for a quick hello,

03:18.662 --> 03:20.998
and make it back to the school
in time for the Jack-Off.

03:21.031 --> 03:22.466
The what now?

03:22.498 --> 03:23.800
Well, that's what the kids
have started calling

03:23.834 --> 03:25.836
the jack-o'-lantern contest.

03:25.869 --> 03:28.973
Breezing through, you're not
gonna be able to make both,

03:29.006 --> 03:30.841
not with Halloween traffic.

03:30.873 --> 03:33.310
This is what you do...
You get Tony to drive you.

03:33.342 --> 03:34.744
He's insanely fast.

03:34.777 --> 03:38.348
He was the stunt driver on
"Smokey and the Bandit" 1 and 3.

03:38.382 --> 03:40.017
But not "Smokey and the Bandit II"?

03:40.049 --> 03:42.051
Mnh. Didn't like the script.

03:42.085 --> 03:44.488
Daddy? They're coming.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.922
Oh, great. Um, Sophie,

03:45.955 --> 03:48.024
I-I think I'm actually gonna
be a little late to Halloween.

03:48.057 --> 03:49.259
Why?

03:49.293 --> 03:50.661
Um... when grown-ups

03:50.693 --> 03:52.262
are in an adult relationship...

03:52.295 --> 03:54.531
- He has to go pick up Life Savers.
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.563 --> 03:56.366
But you'll be back in time
for the pumpkin contest?

03:56.400 --> 03:58.602
- Oh, yeah.
- We're gonna win this year, for sure.

03:58.634 --> 04:01.704
First-place prize is
a $30 gift card to Denny's.

04:02.773 --> 04:04.073
Life Savers?

04:04.107 --> 04:05.709
It's right there in the name.

04:05.741 --> 04:07.176
All right, all right, let's go.

04:07.210 --> 04:10.281
Everyone leaving for Hilltop,
please step forward. Uhp!

04:10.313 --> 04:12.015
Not so fast, Mom and Angie.

04:12.049 --> 04:14.518
Rory and I have something to say to you.

04:14.550 --> 04:16.019
We've decided that we're big kids now,

04:16.053 --> 04:17.887
and we can handle Halloween without you.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.923
We're telling you
in front of other people

04:18.956 --> 04:20.624
so you won't make a scene.

04:20.656 --> 04:22.699
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:22.724 --> 04:24.384
Okay, bye, Mom. Don't have a meltdown.

04:24.409 --> 04:25.896
See you later! You'll be fine!

04:25.928 --> 04:27.464
Don't worry about us.

04:27.497 --> 04:29.566
Just gifted us a girls' night.

04:29.598 --> 04:32.135
So get out of here
so we can start partying.

04:33.170 --> 04:34.638
All right.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.139
A whole night to ourselves?

04:36.173 --> 04:37.240
What do you want to do?

04:37.274 --> 04:39.976
Mm-mnh-mnh. You want to, uh...

04:40.009 --> 04:41.381
cry?

04:41.413 --> 04:42.478
Yeah.

04:42.512 --> 04:44.915
Our kids just ditched us.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.986
Remember, buddy, Will's counting on us.

04:49.019 --> 04:50.149
Keep it spooky.

04:51.788 --> 04:53.990
Trick or treat!

04:54.024 --> 04:57.295
And to you, too. Booooo!

04:58.528 --> 04:59.830
Is that it?

04:59.863 --> 05:02.266
Yeah. Why?

05:02.298 --> 05:04.435
- This is Will Cooper's house, right?
- Mm-hmm.

05:04.468 --> 05:06.470
We've just come to expect more.

05:06.502 --> 05:09.440
He really put on a show last year.

05:09.473 --> 05:10.441
I-I can do it again.

05:10.473 --> 05:12.142
I think maybe you didn't hear the "boo."

05:12.175 --> 05:13.477
We heard it.

05:13.509 --> 05:15.445
- Is Will coming back?
- No.

05:15.478 --> 05:18.147
Oh. Where is he?

05:18.180 --> 05:21.752
He's...

05:21.784 --> 05:23.319
dead.

05:23.353 --> 05:24.687
Oh, my God.

05:24.721 --> 05:26.523
I know. Spooky, right?

05:26.555 --> 05:29.293
Well, I mean, it's terrible.
But how did he...

05:29.326 --> 05:31.295
We did it, buddy!

05:34.163 --> 05:36.265
So, Douglas, it was your job

05:36.298 --> 05:38.301
to decorate the classroom for Halloween.

05:38.334 --> 05:41.037
How many G's did you drop
on fake cobwebs?

05:41.070 --> 05:42.972
Wait,<i> I</i> was supposed to decorate?

05:43.005 --> 05:44.974
You were supposed to <i>
elaborately</i> decorate.

05:45.007 --> 05:47.610
You're the Room Parent.

05:47.644 --> 05:49.749
Well, there's nothing scarier
than disappointment.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.022
There. I did it.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:06.730 --> 06:09.466
I am 8, and I am brave.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.035
So, you <i> did</i> decorate?

06:11.067 --> 06:12.635
You were just teasing us?

06:12.668 --> 06:14.303
You nimrods impressed?

06:14.336 --> 06:16.005
Our dad did this.

06:16.038 --> 06:17.206
Uh-huh.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.208
Come on.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.209
Well, Douglas.

06:19.242 --> 06:20.310
As your President,

06:20.341 --> 06:22.379
I would like to formally
apologize for doubting you.

06:22.411 --> 06:23.746
I didn't do any of this.

06:23.779 --> 06:25.581
I don't know how this stuff got in here.

06:25.615 --> 06:28.819
Wait. But if <i> you</i> didn't do
any of this, then who did?

06:28.851 --> 06:29.887
No idea.

06:29.919 --> 06:32.488
So, it could be
some dangerous psychopath

06:32.521 --> 06:34.858
who's still lurking on the premises?

06:34.891 --> 06:37.193
- Well, nothing's off the table.
- Oh, God.

06:37.226 --> 06:39.763
I don't want to die dressed as you.

06:42.065 --> 06:44.767
Ugh! This is the worst Halloween

06:44.800 --> 06:47.782
since everyone dressed as
Left Shark from the Super Bowl.

06:47.852 --> 06:50.032
Bottle me.

06:56.646 --> 06:59.016
Just some teens partying
on the golf course.

06:59.048 --> 07:00.216
Mm. Teen partying.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.185
Remember just making out
in front of your friends?

07:02.218 --> 07:04.288
- Mm-hmm.
- When did that stop being a thing?

07:04.320 --> 07:07.757
Man, I can't believe Graham
and Rory are already over us.

07:07.791 --> 07:09.560
I thought we had more time.

07:09.593 --> 07:11.028
And if they think we're lame now,

07:11.060 --> 07:12.562
just imagine what
they're gonna think of us

07:12.596 --> 07:13.697
when they're teenagers.

07:13.730 --> 07:15.632
This is gonna keep
getting worse and worse,

07:15.665 --> 07:17.367
like the gooey people from Chernobyl.

07:17.399 --> 07:18.957
That's not gonna happen to us, Ang.

07:18.982 --> 07:20.571
No, this is how it goes.

07:20.603 --> 07:22.271
I loved my parents so much,

07:22.305 --> 07:24.274
and then one day, I woke up,
and I never loved them again.

07:24.307 --> 07:26.910
But we're not our parents.
We're actually cool.

07:26.942 --> 07:29.279
I have a liquor license.
You once rented a Jet Ski.

07:29.312 --> 07:31.247
Havasu 2006!

07:31.302 --> 07:32.794
In fact, I bet those teens out there

07:32.833 --> 07:34.011
would think we were pretty awesome.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.651
Awesome? No.

07:35.685 --> 07:38.055
Maybe they think we're hot,
if we're lucky.

07:38.088 --> 07:40.224
Lucky how? No. I don't want to know.

07:40.257 --> 07:43.535
Hey, how about we run an experiment?

07:43.560 --> 07:45.462
No. No, no, no, no, no.

07:45.495 --> 07:47.164
Don't you do this. You always do this.

07:47.197 --> 07:49.766
We get tipsy, and you take
advantage of my love

07:49.798 --> 07:51.534
of the scientific method.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.769
I say we invite those teens
to come party with us.

07:53.803 --> 07:54.939
If they think we're cool,

07:54.964 --> 07:56.916
our kids will also think we're
cool when they're that age.

07:57.002 --> 08:00.142
Well... your logic <i> is</i> rock-solid.

08:00.176 --> 08:01.812
Yes! Ha!

08:01.844 --> 08:03.846
Hey, kids!

08:03.880 --> 08:06.315
Who wants to come party
at a rich dude's house?

08:06.349 --> 08:08.351
With two hot chicks!

08:09.551 --> 08:11.520
If there's an Alexa listening,
I want to be clear,

08:11.553 --> 08:12.988
I do not need teens to think I'm hot.

08:13.022 --> 08:14.024
Mm-hmm.

08:25.056 --> 08:27.672
Long time since your "Smokey
and the Bandit" days, huh?

08:27.734 --> 08:29.373
Okay, I'm gonna be in and out
in 20 minutes.

08:29.406 --> 08:31.775
Be ready to fly.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.619
Hey. Happy birthday.

08:48.644 --> 08:50.624
Oh, my God! You came!

08:50.649 --> 08:52.729
That's right. I can do it all!

08:52.762 --> 08:53.997
Will, this is incredible.

08:54.038 --> 08:55.742
Oh, everybody, this is Will,

08:55.792 --> 08:57.566
the employee I chose to date despite HR.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.969
<i>Milo mi cie poznac.</i>

08:59.002 --> 09:01.138
<i>- Czesc!
- Dzien dobry!</i>

09:01.171 --> 09:02.269
Oh!

09:02.294 --> 09:04.608
I might have done some
flashcards on the ride over.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.775
- Ah.
- I also may have learned

09:05.808 --> 09:07.910
the Polish birthday song.

09:07.944 --> 09:08.945
Freeze party?

09:08.978 --> 09:10.147
♪ <i>Sto lat</i> ♪

09:10.180 --> 09:11.415

09:11.447 --> 09:13.917

Thank you, thank you.

09:29.331 --> 09:30.636
Wait, what is this?

09:32.201 --> 09:34.604
<i>This is the Padded Cell Escape Room,</i>

09:34.637 --> 09:36.138
<i>an asylum so frightening,</i>

09:36.172 --> 09:38.551
<i>you'll want to tip, tip, tip!</i>

09:38.583 --> 09:40.683
<i>Welcome to Hell, sickos!</i>

09:40.710 --> 09:42.215
I don't want to be a sicko.

09:42.889 --> 09:45.225
So, you love escape rooms?

09:45.258 --> 09:48.131
What a fun detail to learn
at the most opportune moment.

09:48.163 --> 09:49.842
Yeah, I've been doing them
for a couple years now,

09:49.904 --> 09:52.021
and now my Polish relatives
are addicted.

09:52.084 --> 09:53.076
Every time I talk to them,

09:53.123 --> 09:54.842
they're like,<i>
"Czy robimy pokój ucieczki?"</i>

09:54.897 --> 09:58.069
100%. But I do think that I'm...

09:58.102 --> 10:01.037
You know, I am so glad
that you are here.

10:01.108 --> 10:04.092
You have absolutely made my birthday.

10:05.202 --> 10:07.072
Are you really sticking around?

10:08.287 --> 10:09.622
Yaiyse.

10:11.115 --> 10:13.653
- Now, this escape room...
- Mm.

10:13.686 --> 10:15.186
...es-quick room, es-long room?

10:15.220 --> 10:16.622
How much time are we talking?

10:16.654 --> 10:19.290
Well, I asked for the most
difficult one because last year,

10:19.324 --> 10:21.260
Uncle Mikolaj actually
brought his own shovel

10:21.292 --> 10:22.861
and dug himself out in 15 minutes.

10:22.894 --> 10:25.415
I don't know. I'm thinking
about two hours or so?

10:25.430 --> 10:27.600
Two hours!

10:27.633 --> 10:31.369
Papa Pizza,
that's a spicy-a chunk-a-time!

10:31.403 --> 10:33.538
Yeah, it's an intense one.
And they can touch you.

10:33.571 --> 10:34.639
You signed a waiver.

10:34.672 --> 10:35.840
Trapped and touched?

10:35.874 --> 10:37.442
Um... is it <i> my</i> birthday?

10:39.244 --> 10:40.646
All right, here's the deal.

10:40.678 --> 10:42.947
Between you and me, I have to be
at my daughter's school

10:42.980 --> 10:44.984
for a pumpkin contest in,
like, less than an hour,

10:45.017 --> 10:46.385
so I will give you $20 for any tips

10:46.417 --> 10:47.686
to get this thing moving along.

10:50.221 --> 10:53.058
Will, did you try and cheat?

10:53.091 --> 10:54.359
No.

10:54.393 --> 10:56.629
Wh... Ow, ow, ow! What is happening?

10:56.662 --> 10:59.065
Yeah, I think this is actually,
like, a bit much, right?

10:59.098 --> 11:01.667
Oh, someone's gonna get sedated.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.235
- Sleepy, sleepy.
- No. No. No.

11:04.268 --> 11:05.738
I will not take your voodoo medicine.

11:05.771 --> 11:06.972
You get away from me.

11:06.997 --> 11:08.815
You will not... No, please!

11:10.776 --> 11:12.545
Oh, it's a SweeTART.

11:17.615 --> 11:20.218
Okay, I'm starting to think
that this was a bad idea.

11:20.252 --> 11:22.388
All right, t-they don't
even think <i> we're</i> cool.

11:22.421 --> 11:23.489
They think the <i> house</i> is cool.

11:23.522 --> 11:24.932
No, we're cool, okay?

11:24.957 --> 11:26.258
We just gotta get in there.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.927
Watch this.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.896
Attention, everyone!

11:30.928 --> 11:34.699
Can someone please turn that music...

11:34.733 --> 11:37.169
up!

11:40.605 --> 11:41.840
Time me!

11:41.866 --> 11:45.386
O.J.! O.J.! O.J.! O.J.!

11:47.079 --> 11:50.181
Okay, who used my phone to order pizza?

11:50.215 --> 11:52.451
It was me!

11:55.376 --> 11:57.288
O.J.! O.J.!

11:57.321 --> 12:00.926
Four score and seven years ago...

12:00.959 --> 12:03.262
Yeah! She's so cool!

12:03.295 --> 12:04.764
Yeah!

12:04.797 --> 12:07.398
So, then I told Ron, "I know
why you downloaded Snapchat,

12:07.431 --> 12:09.301
and it wasn't for the puppy filters."

12:09.334 --> 12:10.603
Britney knows what I'm talking about.

12:10.635 --> 12:12.036
You know Snapchat?

12:12.070 --> 12:13.539
Oh, I know <i> all</i> the apps.

12:26.784 --> 12:29.387
Happy Hallowee...

12:29.421 --> 12:31.956
I told the rest of the block
about Will's passing.

12:31.989 --> 12:34.393
How are you holding up?

12:34.426 --> 12:35.728
Uh...

12:35.760 --> 12:36.961
Hanging in.

12:36.994 --> 12:39.991
Yeah, it... it has been
very spooky on the family.

12:42.633 --> 12:44.390
Can I just have a moment, please?

12:45.624 --> 12:47.907
Is it possible I made it too spooky?

12:47.940 --> 12:49.842
Should I just come clean?

12:49.874 --> 12:52.010
You're right, Jack.

12:52.043 --> 12:53.444
The Park family doesn't give up.

12:53.478 --> 12:56.315
We double down.

12:56.348 --> 12:58.751
So, I got to ask.

12:58.783 --> 13:01.854
How is Will's daughter
doing with all of this?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.255
She gone, too.

13:06.124 --> 13:08.127
This looks really good. Wow.

13:10.061 --> 13:13.431
Hey, have you seen my dad?

13:13.465 --> 13:15.100
They're announcing the winners soon.

13:15.133 --> 13:17.603
Maybe he stopped for gas
and then lost himself

13:17.635 --> 13:20.271
in the generic pastry section
at the Smart Mart.

13:20.305 --> 13:22.274
But I want him here when I win.

13:22.306 --> 13:24.375
I got the best pumpkin of everyone.

13:24.408 --> 13:26.644
This one just has a square
carved into it.

13:26.677 --> 13:28.279
That... That's mine.

13:28.312 --> 13:30.215
It's supposed to be Colorado.

13:30.249 --> 13:33.284
Do you particularly like Colorado?

13:33.317 --> 13:34.471
No.

13:36.087 --> 13:38.122
Fogerty, why aren't you
getting us out of here?

13:38.156 --> 13:39.892
There could be a killer on the loose.

13:39.925 --> 13:41.359
Eh, I'm a little creeped out, too,

13:41.393 --> 13:44.062
but, uh, try not to cause a panic.

13:44.095 --> 13:45.864
Well, guess what. It is time to panic.

13:45.898 --> 13:47.032
There is a dead rat.

13:48.066 --> 13:50.502
This entire classroom is a death threat.

13:50.534 --> 13:52.136
Yeah, that's not great. Okay.

13:52.170 --> 13:53.906
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna
take care of this.

13:55.773 --> 13:58.910
All right, do not react
to anything I say next.

13:58.944 --> 14:02.715
These terrifying decorations
were placed here not by me,

14:02.748 --> 14:05.417
but instead by a dangerous psychotic.

14:05.450 --> 14:07.319
So, calmly follow me out the door,

14:07.351 --> 14:10.331
and don't attempt to save your friends.

14:10.356 --> 14:11.722
They're already dead.

14:11.747 --> 14:12.972
Dad, wait.

14:12.997 --> 14:14.292
<i>We</i> decorated the classroom.

14:14.317 --> 14:16.230
You guys did this?

14:17.113 --> 14:18.287
Wow.

14:18.312 --> 14:19.664
Okay.

14:19.697 --> 14:21.199
Give Daddy a moment.

14:23.268 --> 14:25.436
Okay, good news, Rory. Mystery solved.

14:25.470 --> 14:28.340
My, uh... My kids did all this.

14:28.373 --> 14:29.541
How is that good news?

14:29.574 --> 14:31.510
You do realize you're
living with psychopaths?

14:31.542 --> 14:33.778
Well, when you say it like that,
it is upsetting.

14:35.947 --> 14:38.549
Not sure about the one on the right.

14:40.585 --> 14:43.122
Ha-ha! Time to go home.

14:43.154 --> 14:44.255
Britney!

14:44.288 --> 14:45.857
What are the three words we live by?

14:45.890 --> 14:48.293
Don't text Josh.

14:48.326 --> 14:50.729
- Yep.
- That was awesome.

14:50.762 --> 14:52.531
Those teens were eating out
of the palm of our hands.

14:52.563 --> 14:53.798
I told you those kids would love us.

14:53.831 --> 14:55.133
And you know what?
Graham and Rory will, too.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.201
You were right.

14:57.234 --> 14:59.404
- We <i> are</i> the coolest!
- We are.

14:59.437 --> 15:01.606
Now, let's celebrate with
some of Douglas' good stuff.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.374
He's got $600 Scotch.

15:06.912 --> 15:08.446
Oh, my God.

15:08.479 --> 15:10.916
They stole all the liquor.

15:10.949 --> 15:13.585
Even the Drambuie. That's disgusting.

15:14.619 --> 15:17.822
Ang, we are not cool. We're chumps.

15:17.855 --> 15:21.826
Bitch... mom... activate!

15:23.628 --> 15:26.331
All right, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go!

15:26.364 --> 15:28.499
Wait, have you been measuring in meters?

15:28.532 --> 15:29.835
Oh, my God, I'm gonna cry.

15:29.868 --> 15:31.236
Will, this is supposed to be fun.

15:31.268 --> 15:32.270
- I'm having fun.
- Mm-hmm.

15:32.303 --> 15:34.439
Guy McCormick, what are you doing?

15:34.473 --> 15:38.344
I hid a bottle of whiskey behind
a bed back when I lived here,

15:38.377 --> 15:40.746
and now it's gone.

15:40.778 --> 15:42.780
Oh, Guy, this is not a real pla...

15:42.813 --> 15:45.249
And why have we given the key puzzle

15:45.282 --> 15:46.918
to the two folks with the shakiest hands

15:46.951 --> 15:48.686
in all of occupied Europe?

15:48.720 --> 15:51.190
I mean, how many Poles does it
take to open a medicine cabinet?

15:51.223 --> 15:52.593
I'm kidding. But I'm not.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.092
All right, get your heads in the game

15:54.125 --> 15:55.320
so we can get the hell out of here!

15:55.345 --> 15:56.528
Okay, Will, you seem a little stressed.

15:56.561 --> 15:58.162
Everyone else here's having a good time.

15:58.196 --> 15:59.431
Well, I am not, okay?

15:59.464 --> 16:00.933
It's Halloween, and Sophie needs me

16:00.965 --> 16:02.334
at the pumpkin carving contest, okay?

16:02.367 --> 16:04.003
If she loses, I have to console her.

16:04.036 --> 16:05.771
If she wins,
I have to take her to Denny's.

16:05.803 --> 16:08.039
Look, I know that Halloween
is a big night for kids.

16:08.072 --> 16:09.941
If you need to go see Sophie,
then you should go.

16:09.975 --> 16:11.176
No one's stopping you.

16:11.209 --> 16:13.379
I'm in a straitjacket-uh.

16:19.850 --> 16:21.720
I see.

16:21.753 --> 16:24.455
I have to go. I'm sorry.

16:27.859 --> 16:28.933
- Oh.
- Ooh!

16:28.958 --> 16:30.129
Ohh.

16:30.162 --> 16:31.463
- Oh.
- I think that was your cake.

16:31.495 --> 16:32.463
Ohh.

16:37.402 --> 16:38.570
Go, go, go, go, go!

16:50.119 --> 16:51.407
There they are!

16:51.462 --> 16:52.493
How do I look?

16:52.533 --> 16:53.626
Okay, yeah, I'll be doing the talking.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.009
I'm not gonna be cool.
I'm gonna be a mom.

16:56.048 --> 16:59.394
A scary mom with bad jeans
and lots of rules.

16:59.425 --> 17:00.933
All right, kids.

17:00.972 --> 17:04.256
I am very disappointed
in each and every one of y...

17:04.289 --> 17:06.479
Britney, is this Josh?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.939
He deleted Snapchat.

17:07.964 --> 17:10.398
Oh, honey, he just hid it in a folder...

17:10.432 --> 17:11.968
Nope. Not my problem.

17:12.002 --> 17:14.570
Give us our booze back,
or we're calling the cops.

17:14.603 --> 17:16.778
Or worse, your parents.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.374
You know you want this.

17:18.407 --> 17:19.876
Wrong track, Angie.

17:19.909 --> 17:22.111
And we can find your parents.
You know why?

17:22.145 --> 17:25.549
Because we are parents,
and parents know other parents.

17:25.582 --> 17:27.451
- Bing bong!
- Hmm?

17:27.483 --> 17:28.452
Now scram!

17:31.153 --> 17:32.210
Yeah! That's right!

17:32.235 --> 17:33.647
These moms will find you

17:33.672 --> 17:36.258
with our big bags
and our sensible sneakers!

17:36.292 --> 17:37.894
And we keep these bodies tight!

17:37.927 --> 17:40.831
You hear... No, Angie. No.

17:43.966 --> 17:46.834
Hey, Sophie. Hey.

17:46.874 --> 17:48.560
I am so sorry I missed you
winning the contest.

17:48.585 --> 17:50.421
We lost. Where were you?

17:50.446 --> 17:53.137
I thought I could drop by Tracy's party

17:53.162 --> 17:54.244
and make it back in time,

17:54.276 --> 17:56.316
but then I was thrown
into a straitjacket

17:56.341 --> 17:58.281
and forced to solve a puzzle
with Uncle Mikolaj.

17:58.313 --> 17:59.815
You get it.

17:59.849 --> 18:02.418
Why didn't you just tell me
you wanted to stop by Tracy's?

18:02.451 --> 18:04.420
I should've.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.591
I just... I'm trying to balance
my time between the two of you,

18:07.623 --> 18:10.427
and I never want you to feel
like you are not number one.

18:10.459 --> 18:14.597
I don't, but maybe balancing
your time wouldn't be so hard

18:14.630 --> 18:16.033
if you didn't keep us so separate.

18:16.065 --> 18:17.199
Wait, really?

18:17.233 --> 18:19.036
You'd be willing for
the three of us to hang out?

18:19.069 --> 18:21.138
Yeah. I'd be down with that.

18:21.170 --> 18:23.172
Oh. Cool.

18:23.206 --> 18:24.975
Hey, maybe we could go bowling?

18:25.007 --> 18:27.110
Yaiyse.

18:27.142 --> 18:29.405
Okay, not bowling.
We'll figure something else out.

18:29.430 --> 18:31.947
Now, tell me all about
this pumpkin carving contest.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.983
Stupid Rocco Risoli won with a carving

18:34.016 --> 18:36.687
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg
eating a meatball sub.

18:36.719 --> 18:38.221
- What?!
- It didn't even make sense!

18:40.189 --> 18:41.957
Okay, there's no way this cheap stuff

18:41.991 --> 18:43.293
is gonna fool Douglas.

18:43.325 --> 18:45.995
Well, neither of us have
the 600 bucks to buy a new one,

18:46.028 --> 18:48.931
so you know what that means...
more smoky steak sauce.

18:50.065 --> 18:52.201
All right, I guess we shouldn't
fight it, okay?

18:52.235 --> 18:54.737
We are not cool, and our kids
are gonna stop loving us.

18:54.771 --> 18:55.938
Mom.

18:58.774 --> 18:59.709
Funnel!

19:01.444 --> 19:03.080
We're back.

19:03.112 --> 19:05.381
From the Halloween that will
be referred to in court

19:05.415 --> 19:07.384
as "the day I should've said something."

19:08.557 --> 19:10.219
It was traumatizing.

19:10.253 --> 19:11.822
I'm so sorry I asked you not to come.

19:11.854 --> 19:14.691
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- Mom, it was terrible.

19:14.724 --> 19:16.693
People hate Colorado.

19:16.726 --> 19:18.395
Oh, Graham.

19:18.428 --> 19:19.877
Guess what.

19:19.902 --> 19:22.703
I got you a new toothbrush.
It has frogs on it.

19:22.728 --> 19:23.834
Frogs?!

19:23.867 --> 19:25.335
You're the coolest!

19:25.368 --> 19:26.837
Who would've ever thought?

19:26.870 --> 19:30.306
Me with a frog toothbrush.

19:32.274 --> 19:34.177
Well, it looks like we've still
got some time left.

19:34.209 --> 19:35.211
Mm-hmm.

19:37.147 --> 19:39.582
Okay, I have to know.

19:39.616 --> 19:41.618
Did you kill that rat yourselves?

19:41.650 --> 19:43.853
No. That wasn't us.

19:43.887 --> 19:46.123
Hilltop just isn't a very clean school.

19:46.156 --> 19:47.624
Thank God.

19:47.657 --> 19:49.615
But why did you guys do all that?

19:49.640 --> 19:52.310
We knew you'd totally beef it
on the decorations.

19:52.343 --> 19:56.141
Since you've been completely
beefing it at being Room Parent.

19:56.166 --> 19:59.326
Yeah. We didn't want people
to get mad at you again.

19:59.368 --> 20:02.271
We just wanted everyone
to see you like we see you.

20:02.305 --> 20:05.009
A solid earner and a pretty good dad.

20:06.475 --> 20:07.710
Well, that's beautiful, girls,

20:07.743 --> 20:10.547
and I-I guess I didn't consider

20:10.579 --> 20:12.948
how half-assing it would make you feel.

20:12.982 --> 20:16.987
But I'll tell you what,
in the future, I promise...

20:17.020 --> 20:20.539
mwah... I will put more effort in, okay?

20:20.564 --> 20:22.525
Mwah. Good night.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.529
Dad?

20:25.561 --> 20:26.962
Yeah?

20:26.995 --> 20:29.398
Is Will really not Jewish?

20:29.432 --> 20:32.135
Of course he is, honey.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.936
Of course he is.

20:37.357 --> 20:39.849
As I held his dying body in my arms,

20:39.920 --> 20:42.123
he looked me right in the eyes and said,

20:42.201 --> 20:44.658
"Do Halloween for me."

20:44.692 --> 20:46.023
And then he was gone.

20:46.048 --> 20:48.213
Off to the big haunted house in the sky.

20:48.283 --> 20:49.918
How awful.

20:49.952 --> 20:51.320
Thank you.

20:52.298 --> 20:53.522
What's going on here?

20:53.554 --> 20:55.624
Oh, my God! Will, Sophie!

20:55.657 --> 20:57.995
- You're alive!
- Hell yeah, they are.

20:58.020 --> 20:58.951
Y'all got spooked.

20:58.976 --> 21:02.351
Um, Miggy... what's happening?

21:02.383 --> 21:04.762
Don't ever question
my spookability again.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.399
Wilson, we out.

21:09.199 --> 21:12.003
I lost you once. I won't lose you again.

21:12.035 --> 21:13.337
Mmm.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.340
Mmm.

21:15.372 --> 21:16.573
Mwah.

21:16.661 --> 21:18.932
Happy Halloween.

21:19.054 --> 21:24.054
