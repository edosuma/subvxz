Hayley: If we can't create

00:03.121 --> 00:05.790
some sort of community,
then what's the point?

00:05.791 --> 00:07.725
Kill each other and get
it all over with.

00:07.726 --> 00:09.427
Elijah: If there is
no peace between us,

00:09.428 --> 00:11.575
then how can you expect
others to follow suit?

00:11.576 --> 00:14.457
Klaus: The city's inhabitants will
not adhere to this agreement.

00:14.458 --> 00:16.100
Aah!

00:16.101 --> 00:19.037
The guy on the bike, the bomber,
owed money to the casinos.

00:19.038 --> 00:20.372
More importantly,
to the humans who run them.

00:20.373 --> 00:22.167
The ancestors told me to let you live.

00:22.168 --> 00:24.121
Whatever it is they want,
I will make sure they get it.

00:24.122 --> 00:26.343
They want us to kill Klaus' child.

00:26.344 --> 00:29.247
I've been hexed, and I
don't know how long I have.

00:32.350 --> 00:34.986
Klaus: I'm calling to let
you know the priest is dead.

00:34.987 --> 00:38.054
Your exile is suspended
for the next 24 hours.

00:38.056 --> 00:41.658
You may return to the quarter
to bury your friend.

is full of ghosts.

Our dead are always here hovering.

03:18.916 --> 03:21.050
When supernatural creatures
die, they're doomed

03:21.051 --> 03:24.954
to spend eternity alone watching
the world go on without them.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.657
Of course, that's not the case
for the ancestral witches.

Some find peace.
Some... don't.

who might still be
walking alongside you.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.719
I don't know why we're
supposed to care

03:56.720 --> 03:58.621
about Kieran O'Connell.

03:58.622 --> 04:01.624
We care because when a pillar
of our community passes,

04:01.625 --> 04:04.460
Monique, you call
a cease-fire and pay respects.

04:04.461 --> 04:07.062
Or you just want to see Klaus.

04:07.063 --> 04:09.031
You two are getting cozy.

04:09.032 --> 04:12.001
I need the Mikaelsons to trust
me so I can get close enough.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.801
To kill their baby?

04:16.637 --> 04:20.141
To fulfill my obligation
to our ancestors.

04:21.543 --> 04:24.212

Unless you come equipped
with the means to fill this,

04:56.713 --> 05:00.115
no additional platitudes
are necessary.

05:00.116 --> 05:04.953
Ok. I'm in a crap mood
because my Uncle just died

05:04.954 --> 05:06.721
and people are partying
like it's Mardi Gras.

05:06.722 --> 05:08.556

05:18.134 --> 05:20.000
I've already got this one covered.

My fears of fatherhood,
of scarring my child

05:22.772 --> 05:26.508
as my father scarred me are
manifesting as nightmares.

05:26.509 --> 05:29.443
So horrifically cliche.

05:29.445 --> 05:32.714
Truthfully, I'm just surprised
to hear you acknowledge out loud

05:32.715 --> 05:34.282
that you're going to be a dad.

05:34.283 --> 05:37.152
Your baby mama's been living
in the bayou for months.

05:37.153 --> 05:40.454
It's not exactly what to
expect when you're expecting.

05:41.556 --> 05:43.958
I know more about
the trials of fatherhood

05:43.959 --> 05:46.226
than you might imagine, Camille.

05:49.731 --> 05:51.933

for you the first time.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.634

06:02.236 --> 06:06.180
Well. I see you've come to
return some stolen property.

06:06.181 --> 06:07.615
On the contrary.

I've decided the boy
shall remain with me.

06:12.387 --> 06:14.588

06:16.591 --> 06:18.458
You will grant him his freedom.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.193
And if I say no?

06:21.213 --> 06:25.465
You seem to have misinterpreted
the matter as up for debate.

06:27.034 --> 06:29.836
[Hoarsely] Fine. Take him.

06:33.674 --> 06:34.842

06:34.843 --> 06:36.843
A damn to me anyway.

06:40.014 --> 06:42.315
They told me he is your father.

06:46.454 --> 06:48.121
Is it true?

06:52.626 --> 06:56.196
You know, my father hated me, too.

06:56.197 --> 07:01.001
The truth is, Marcellus, family
can be more than just those

these parts lately.

07:28.463 --> 07:30.664
It's a testament to father Kieran

07:30.665 --> 07:32.031
that we could come together

07:32.033 --> 07:35.201
and share a drink and a story or two.

07:35.203 --> 07:38.705
Kieran rolled into town
on a rusty old cruiser

07:38.706 --> 07:41.640
after his daddy died 25 years ago.

07:41.642 --> 07:43.676

07:43.678 --> 07:45.512

07:45.513 --> 07:47.514
That was, of course,
before he took his vows.

07:47.515 --> 07:50.851
But even then, he was
committed to the quarter.

07:50.852 --> 07:52.852

as faction representative

were compromised.

08:48.075 --> 08:49.609
His faculties weren't compromised.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.077
He was hexed.

08:51.078 --> 08:53.612
Hexed by one of our enemies.

Look, I'm invested in protecting
the people of this city.

08:56.717 --> 08:58.750
And to do that, I need the key.

08:58.752 --> 09:00.119

to his untimely death.

My Uncle lost his mind,

15:28.486 --> 15:30.553
beat the crap out of me,
and then died.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.488
And now I have to sit
by his body all night.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.423
I'll sit with you.

15:34.425 --> 15:35.625
I'm not trying to lie to you.

15:35.626 --> 15:36.660
I'm trying to protect you.

15:36.661 --> 15:38.427
You need to leave, like, now.

15:38.429 --> 15:39.830
I will tell you about the key.

15:39.831 --> 15:40.996
I don't want to know!

15:40.998 --> 15:43.599
I don't want to know any of it.

15:49.539 --> 15:50.973
[Puts glass on table]

15:59.015 --> 16:01.050
[Chatter in adjoining room]

16:02.118 --> 16:03.553
Genevieve.

16:03.554 --> 16:07.223
I asked around.
It's not just your father.

16:07.224 --> 16:10.226
The purgatory, where
supernatural souls are trapped,

16:10.227 --> 16:11.427
is disintegrating.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.996
What do you mean, disintegrating?

16:12.997 --> 16:14.764
She's right, more or less.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.498
It's actually imploding.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.668
I made a call to a rather
reluctant Bennett witch

16:18.669 --> 16:20.669
in Mystic Falls, who said
the same thing...

16:20.671 --> 16:24.207
The dead are being torn
away into nothingness.

16:24.208 --> 16:27.109
And they're not interested
in going quietly.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.211
So you're saying that our father,

16:28.212 --> 16:29.612
faced with permanent extinction,

16:29.613 --> 16:32.180
has decided to spend his
remaining time tormenting us.

16:32.182 --> 16:33.982
How delightful.

16:33.984 --> 16:35.551
Well, on the plus side,

16:35.552 --> 16:37.553
we'll soon be rid of
his abhorrent soul forever.

16:37.554 --> 16:40.355
And what a good riddance that will be.

16:40.357 --> 16:42.724
So am I in the clear, Elijah?

16:42.726 --> 16:44.293
Or is there a new conspiracy

16:44.294 --> 16:45.795
you two would like
to threaten me over?

16:45.796 --> 16:48.764
Nothing springs to mind
at this precise moment.

16:48.766 --> 16:51.166
Oh, gee, thanks.

16:52.735 --> 16:55.204
I have to get back to the girls.

16:55.205 --> 16:57.740
Perhaps tomorrow after the funeral,

16:57.741 --> 17:00.543
you and I could spend
some time together...

17:00.544 --> 17:02.878
Alone.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.446
I suppose we'll have to see.

17:05.449 --> 17:07.082
[Scoffs]

17:11.619 --> 17:13.089
Please tell me you've designed

17:13.089 --> 17:14.890
a stronger method to control the witch

17:14.891 --> 17:17.059
than playing hard to get.

17:17.060 --> 17:19.359
Klaus: Well, I've always been
partial to the classics.

17:26.402 --> 17:30.705
Ah. Hayley, right?

17:32.274 --> 17:33.709
I'm guessing you're not here

17:33.710 --> 17:35.543
because you want to make a new friend.

17:35.545 --> 17:37.980
I don't count terrorists as friends.

17:37.981 --> 17:40.516
Wow.
I've been accused

17:40.517 --> 17:42.651
of everything from grand
larceny to blackmail.

17:42.652 --> 17:44.420
But terrorist, that's new.

17:44.421 --> 17:46.255
A human pulled up
to our home in the bayou

17:46.256 --> 17:48.890
on a motorcycle and blew himself up.

17:48.892 --> 17:51.159
I heard. Awful.

17:53.062 --> 17:54.796
Good night.

18:04.139 --> 18:06.208
Word on the street is
he owed 100 grand

18:06.209 --> 18:08.977
to the palace royale casino.

18:08.978 --> 18:11.979
And then after he died,
the debt was erased.

18:11.981 --> 18:13.815
Just like magic.

18:13.816 --> 18:15.450
Jeff was a fixture
at my roulette table.

18:15.451 --> 18:18.453
Sometimes he was up.
Sometimes he was down.

18:18.454 --> 18:20.455
I absolved his family
of the debt he owed

18:20.456 --> 18:22.456
out of the goodness of my heart.

18:24.659 --> 18:29.498
Feel free to sniff around.
My hands are clean.

18:29.499 --> 18:32.901
And I'd advise you
to mind your manners.

18:32.902 --> 18:34.870
It's lucky you're still alive.

18:34.871 --> 18:38.473
You're the one the wolves all
whisper about, like royalty.

18:38.474 --> 18:41.141
If I was interested
in hurting the wolves,

18:41.143 --> 18:42.911
you'd be my target.

18:42.912 --> 18:48.549
And when I go after
someone, I don't miss.

19:08.136 --> 19:14.135
Monique: Purger l'interieur,
etiendre la lumiere

19:33.938 --> 19:36.005
[Bell ringing]

19:44.748 --> 19:46.584
Your reading was beautiful.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.085
Sneak attack. Not fair.
I'm still pissed.

19:50.354 --> 19:52.256
Tell me about the key.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.757
I thought you said
you didn't want to know.

19:53.758 --> 19:56.626
I'd like to say I slept on
it, but I didn't sleep.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.430
I stayed awake all night next
to the body of a hexed priest

19:59.431 --> 20:01.332
only to attend a funeral
filled with vampires.

20:01.333 --> 20:05.134
So I'm thinking you should
tell me about the key.

20:07.571 --> 20:09.405
Kieran told me that
the key leads to something

20:09.407 --> 20:11.775
that can be used against
the supernaturals

20:11.776 --> 20:14.611
if we ever get too far out of line.

20:14.612 --> 20:16.947
Kieran and I had our ups and downs,

20:16.948 --> 20:18.615
but we trusted each other.

20:18.616 --> 20:20.484
So I let it be.

20:20.485 --> 20:23.253
Because I knew if he had to
use whatever Pandora's box

20:23.254 --> 20:26.222
that key opens, it'd be because
he didn't have a choice.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.926
You could've just asked me for it.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.594
Would you have just handed it over?

20:32.963 --> 20:34.331
So what does it open?

20:34.332 --> 20:36.400
I don't know. I turned
the city upside down

20:36.401 --> 20:38.435
last night trying to find it.

20:38.436 --> 20:40.070
The church, the rectory.

20:40.071 --> 20:41.838
I even searched your family's tomb.

20:41.839 --> 20:43.607
It's hard to find
a needle in a haystack

20:43.608 --> 20:45.775
when you don't even know
what the needle looks like.

20:45.777 --> 20:48.011
And you want to know
if I have any ideas.

20:48.012 --> 20:49.645
That's why you're here.

20:49.647 --> 20:52.581
I'm here because my friend died

20:52.583 --> 20:54.617
and my other friend is grieving.

20:56.086 --> 20:57.854
You can question my
intentions all day long,

20:57.855 --> 21:00.824

I'm here for Kieran.

21:00.825 --> 21:02.424

You all right?
You look...

21:24.315 --> 21:27.116
A hundred months' pregnant
and pissed off at the world?

21:27.117 --> 21:29.852
I was going to say, "you look lovely."

21:35.291 --> 21:37.160
Do you think I was the
target of those bombings?

21:37.161 --> 21:38.361
Of course you were the target.

21:38.362 --> 21:42.031
Were I to wage a war on the
wolves, you'd be my first kill.

21:42.032 --> 21:45.467
I would string you up for
all your worship.

21:45.469 --> 21:47.036
I believe that was
my brother's way of telling you

21:47.037 --> 21:49.071
he'd like you to return home with us.

21:49.073 --> 21:52.175
Perhaps try a different approach,
Niklaus,

21:52.176 --> 21:54.277
with fewer references to murder.

21:54.278 --> 21:55.645
As much as I would hate to throw you

21:55.646 --> 21:57.146
over my shoulder and drag you

21:57.147 --> 21:58.881
kicking and screaming to the compound,

21:58.882 --> 22:02.552
we both know I will
for the sake of my child.

22:02.553 --> 22:04.187
One bad dream,
and suddenly you want to be

22:04.188 --> 22:06.688
a responsible daddy.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.526
Let me put this in perspective.

22:10.527 --> 22:13.295
My father lived to torment me.

22:13.297 --> 22:16.299
It is not my intention to become him.

22:16.300 --> 22:19.535
This cycle of misery
ends with my child.

attempt to plead your case.

She's not your child.
She's ours.

22:29.412 --> 22:31.547

Hi. I know you don't know me.

22:40.056 --> 22:45.027
I just wanted to say that I...
I'm sorry about your Uncle.

22:45.028 --> 22:47.496
He was really good to people like me

22:47.497 --> 22:50.799
during the storm, and I
really appreciated that.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.135
Thank you.

22:53.136 --> 22:54.999
You want something, don't you?

22:56.138 --> 22:58.741
I'm sorry about the timing.

22:58.742 --> 23:02.111
I was just wondering
if before he died,

23:02.112 --> 23:04.745
he said anything weird
about Francesca Correa.

23:04.747 --> 23:06.915
I think that she may
have been involved

23:06.916 --> 23:08.784
in an attack on the bayou.

23:08.785 --> 23:10.419
If you hear anything...

23:12.689 --> 23:14.723
mostly failing...
To stay out of all this stuff,

23:14.724 --> 23:16.558
but she's a real bitch.

23:16.559 --> 23:18.726
So, yeah, if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

23:18.728 --> 23:21.563
Thanks. Um, again, sorry
about your Uncle.

heartbeat, but not hers.

Who are you?

24:24.058 --> 24:26.728
I suppose...

24:26.729 --> 24:28.662
I'm family.

24:35.243 --> 24:36.711
In the beginning was the word.

24:36.712 --> 24:38.179
And the word was with God.

24:38.180 --> 24:41.015
He was with God in the beginning.

24:41.016 --> 24:42.650
In him was life.

24:42.651 --> 24:46.687
And that life was
the light of all mankind.

24:46.688 --> 24:50.491
The light shines in the darkness.

24:50.492 --> 24:54.093
And the darkness has not overcome it.

25:01.936 --> 25:03.102
Cami...

25:05.139 --> 25:07.341
Sean didn't have a funeral.

25:07.342 --> 25:08.742
Our parents wanted
nothing to do with him,

25:08.743 --> 25:10.077
so the city had him buried out here

25:10.078 --> 25:12.645
with the criminals
and the John does...

25:12.647 --> 25:14.480
The great unloved.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.751
You said you checked my family's tomb,

25:17.752 --> 25:19.186
but I've been thinking.

25:19.187 --> 25:20.621
All this time, I wondered why Kieran

25:20.622 --> 25:21.722
didn't have Sean interred,

25:21.723 --> 25:23.356
where he belonged, with the family.

25:23.358 --> 25:25.726
But then I realized, what if he saw

25:25.727 --> 25:28.162
an opportunity to hide something

25:28.163 --> 25:30.731
he didn't want anyone else to find?

25:30.732 --> 25:33.299
Cami, we can do this another time.

25:33.301 --> 25:35.968
Bad timing is the theme of the day.

This is very real.

that hideous creature
my children call brother.

26:21.849 --> 26:23.316
You're dead.

26:23.317 --> 26:24.984
How can I be here?

26:25.958 --> 26:27.519
Oh, my God.

No! No! The baby!

26:30.991 --> 26:32.425

Aah!

26:32.426 --> 26:34.126
That kid never had a chance!

26:34.128 --> 26:36.830
And as if your bloodline
isn't filth enough,

26:36.831 --> 26:39.699
you poison it by merging
it with Klaus'?

Aah!

26:51.678 --> 26:53.246
She's not dead.
I'm not dead.

26:53.247 --> 26:56.015
If I was dead, you wouldn't
be trying to kill me.

26:56.016 --> 26:58.184
[Chanting continues]

26:58.185 --> 26:59.485
I'm taking her to a real doctor.

26:59.486 --> 27:02.321
If you move her from here,
my spell will break.

27:02.322 --> 27:04.022
There won't be enough time
to get her to a hospital.

27:04.024 --> 27:05.992
Will the baby survive
if delivered now?

27:05.993 --> 27:07.160
I'll rip it out of her myself.

27:07.161 --> 27:09.094
Hayley will bleed to death.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.164
I won't lose that baby.

27:12.166 --> 27:13.533
I won't lose either of them.

Now!

You're dead, Mikael.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.214
Your son already beat you.

27:28.215 --> 27:31.250
He is not my son!

27:31.251 --> 27:35.220
He's a scourge, a walking
symbol of weakness.

27:39.358 --> 27:43.394
There is no saving that atrocity
festering in your womb.

27:43.396 --> 27:46.064
Klaus will destroy it
one way or another.

27:46.066 --> 27:49.901
Better he dies now
and you along with it.

28:00.579 --> 28:03.282
Aah!

28:03.283 --> 28:06.684
My daughter has an
advantage Klaus never had.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.888
She will never, ever know you.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.756
[Gasping]

28:11.758 --> 28:13.091
Hayley.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.696
You're all right, love.
You're all right.

28:17.697 --> 28:21.299
I saw him, and he tried to kill me.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.603
I saw Mikael.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.828
[Knock knock]

28:42.830 --> 28:46.299
You've proved quite
resilient, little wolf.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.934
Fighters, both of you.

28:50.203 --> 28:54.072
I guess we've had to be,
especially lately.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.511
I've decided that I'm
going to move back in.

28:59.513 --> 29:01.913
Well, I'm relieved to hear it.

29:01.915 --> 29:06.651
But no mouth-breathing bodyguards,
no telling me what to do.

29:06.653 --> 29:10.822
All I ask is that
the child is kept safe.

29:10.824 --> 29:12.592
And what about me?

29:12.593 --> 29:14.127
What happens after she's born?

29:14.128 --> 29:16.496
If you try to take her
away from me, I...

29:16.497 --> 29:18.630
Come with me, hmm?

29:21.133 --> 29:24.870
Please. I want to show you something.

29:45.458 --> 29:46.959
Believe it or not, Hayley,

29:46.960 --> 29:49.727
I would actually like you to be here.

29:51.030 --> 29:54.200
Our daughter should be
raised by her parents

29:54.201 --> 29:56.769
in her family home.

29:56.770 --> 30:00.639
You, me, Elijah, and the miracle
baby all under one roof.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.907
Sounds like a bad reality show.

30:02.909 --> 30:04.342
[Chuckles]

30:06.779 --> 30:09.013
You said you saw my father.

30:09.015 --> 30:12.884
Why do you call him that?
He's not your real dad.

30:12.886 --> 30:16.054
He's done damage
only a father could do.

30:19.825 --> 30:22.427
What did he say to you?

30:29.034 --> 30:30.902
Nothing true.

30:56.628 --> 30:58.062
[Music playing]

31:06.738 --> 31:09.507
Hayley and the baby are fine.

31:09.508 --> 31:11.042
I'd take her to a doctor when she's

31:11.043 --> 31:14.445
gotten some rest, if you want,
but she's in the clear.

31:18.917 --> 31:20.984
I'll see myself out.

31:22.487 --> 31:24.054
Genevieve...

31:30.295 --> 31:32.062
Thank you for your help.

31:33.932 --> 31:35.232
You're welcome.

31:35.234 --> 31:38.268
You tore my sister from my family.

31:40.905 --> 31:43.240
I cannot forgive that.

31:43.242 --> 31:46.945
However, I may be inclined to
show a degree more of kindness

31:46.946 --> 31:50.948
if you were to help me
with a slight issue.

31:50.949 --> 31:52.116
Anything.

31:52.117 --> 31:53.651
When the baby arrives,

31:53.652 --> 31:55.385
Hayley will once again
transform with a full moon.

31:55.387 --> 31:57.788
Now, I would like
to create for her a gift,

31:57.790 --> 32:02.492
a ring of empowerment, something
to control this curse.

32:02.494 --> 32:04.027
What kind of spell would...

32:04.029 --> 32:05.963
A spell of my mother's,

32:05.964 --> 32:08.266
from her grimoire,

32:08.267 --> 32:10.233
which, as I understand,

32:10.235 --> 32:13.703
you have been rather eager to obtain.

32:27.752 --> 32:29.719
Someone must have gotten to it.

32:38.529 --> 32:40.563
I don't think so.

32:47.338 --> 32:49.940
My brother taught me
this code 15 years ago.

32:49.941 --> 32:51.208
I never knew how he learned it.

32:51.209 --> 32:52.977
You can tell me what that says?

32:52.978 --> 32:54.511
I can...

32:54.512 --> 32:57.147
But I won't.
I'm sorry.

32:57.148 --> 32:58.315
Cami, this is too...

32:58.316 --> 33:00.283
Dangerous. Yeah.
I got it.

33:00.285 --> 33:03.152
But if Kieran taught Sean this...

33:04.388 --> 33:07.557
My brother was meant to be
brought into it all along.

33:08.726 --> 33:10.961
That makes it my responsibility now,

33:10.962 --> 33:12.662
whether I like it or not.

33:16.166 --> 33:18.301
What the hell did you do to Hayley?

33:18.303 --> 33:20.204
I was trying to do what
the ancestors asked.

33:20.205 --> 33:22.004
That baby is part witch.

33:22.006 --> 33:24.341
The ancestors want her
consecrated to the earth

33:24.342 --> 33:26.176
so her magic can fuel our community.

33:26.177 --> 33:29.346
She has to be born first
before she can die.

33:29.347 --> 33:30.947
Leave.

33:30.949 --> 33:32.581
I don't want to look at you.

33:40.090 --> 33:43.225
Allumez le feu dans cette femme...

33:49.900 --> 33:53.035
Misericorde.
Don't make me do this.

33:53.037 --> 33:54.837
[Sobbing] She's a baby.

33:54.839 --> 33:58.141
Don't make me a monster.

33:58.142 --> 34:00.609
Please.

34:11.221 --> 34:12.654
No.

34:14.456 --> 34:15.458
[Screaming]

34:15.458 --> 34:19.393
Uh! Aah...

34:23.399 --> 34:26.302
N... no.

34:26.303 --> 34:28.371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:28.371 --> 34:31.206
I'm sorry. I'll do it.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.408
I'll do whatever you want!

34:51.688 --> 34:54.717
Hayley has agreed to
return home to us...

34:56.126 --> 34:58.327
Of her own freewill.

35:08.371 --> 35:11.541
When Mikael is truly gone,

35:11.542 --> 35:14.411
do you think then I'll find peace?

35:14.412 --> 35:16.078
I certainly hope so.

35:18.348 --> 35:21.984
Although it's not only our
father that haunts you, Niklaus.

35:24.187 --> 35:27.022
You might want to make
peace with the living.

35:31.628 --> 35:33.196
Marcel: I demand to know
why their freedom

35:33.197 --> 35:34.663
has not been granted.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.533
All necessary authorities
have ruled in their favor.

35:37.535 --> 35:40.202
You think I don't remember you, boy?

35:41.671 --> 35:44.172
Have they turned you
into one of them yet?

35:44.174 --> 35:46.375
[Chuckling]

35:48.077 --> 35:50.412
I thought not.

35:50.414 --> 35:53.281
[Screaming]

35:54.751 --> 35:56.863
[Woman groans]

35:59.088 --> 36:00.423
[Gunshots]

36:00.424 --> 36:01.590
Ugh!

36:15.104 --> 36:16.973
Here. Let me heal you.

36:16.974 --> 36:18.206
No.

36:19.408 --> 36:22.944
You've always said we'd
choose our family.

36:22.946 --> 36:25.914
So what am I to you, Klaus?

36:25.916 --> 36:30.385
You made me a promise when
you daggered your sister.

36:30.387 --> 36:33.088
It's finally time to make a choice.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.424
Turn me now...

36:35.425 --> 36:37.126
Or let me die.

36:37.127 --> 36:41.597
You do not know what you ask of me.

36:41.598 --> 36:44.400
Becoming like me...

36:44.401 --> 36:48.504
It would Rob you of all
that makes you good.

36:48.505 --> 36:50.839
I know what you are...

36:50.840 --> 36:52.840
Who you are.

36:54.910 --> 36:57.078
This is what I want.

36:59.982 --> 37:01.416
Please.

37:06.855 --> 37:08.923
[Labored breathing]

37:19.635 --> 37:21.035
[Crack]

37:35.851 --> 37:38.553
Your furlough ends
when the clock strikes.

37:38.554 --> 37:40.855
I'm aware. Don't worry.

37:40.857 --> 37:43.424
I intend to be far away
from here by then.

37:43.426 --> 37:46.761
But just because I'm across the river

37:46.762 --> 37:49.129
doesn't mean I'm out of the game.

37:50.164 --> 37:51.599
A full moon's coming.

37:51.601 --> 37:54.536
I know you're up to
something with the wolves.

37:54.537 --> 37:57.505
And I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out what.

37:57.506 --> 38:01.875
And any way I do the math, it
ends with me and my guys dead.

38:03.812 --> 38:06.780
Or maybe we're supposed
to fall in line,

38:06.782 --> 38:09.718
pledge our allegiance
to you all over again.

38:09.719 --> 38:14.155
So if we get bitten, you
might deign to cure us.

38:14.156 --> 38:16.790
Is that what you're after?

38:16.792 --> 38:18.692
Because it's not gonna happen.

38:18.694 --> 38:22.831
Well, that will be your
choice, just as you chose

38:22.832 --> 38:24.898
to bring my father to town...

38:26.134 --> 38:29.671
You, who knows better than
anyone the specific agony

38:29.672 --> 38:31.371
of a father's hatred.

38:31.373 --> 38:32.573
Klaus...

38:32.574 --> 38:34.242
I spent decades trying to make up

38:34.243 --> 38:36.510
for what your father did.

38:37.945 --> 38:39.913
How did I fail?

38:41.716 --> 38:44.785
Maybe the scars just ran too deep.

38:51.559 --> 38:53.360
Good night, Marcellus.

38:55.796 --> 38:58.031
You didn't fail me.

38:59.133 --> 39:01.001
You raised me.

39:01.003 --> 39:05.405
You taught me everything that I know.

39:05.407 --> 39:08.208
You taught me that I
can't afford to be weak,

39:08.210 --> 39:10.077
not when my enemies are stronger.

39:10.078 --> 39:12.613
So whatever it is you got
coming with the wolves,

39:12.614 --> 39:15.583
just know that I'm gonna
fight for my guys.

39:15.584 --> 39:17.084
I'm gonna fight for my city.

39:17.085 --> 39:19.486
And I will fight until I am dead.

39:23.357 --> 39:25.493
I would expect nothing less.

39:25.494 --> 39:27.760
[Music playing]

39:50.551 --> 39:55.088
If I died and someone threw a
party, I would be so pissed.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.534
You almost did.

40:11.772 --> 40:14.241
In a thousand years,
I can't recall a time

40:14.242 --> 40:18.344
I've felt so frightened.

40:29.289 --> 40:30.823
Elijah...

41:12.732 --> 41:14.233
[Chimes ringing]

41:20.506 --> 41:22.908
Tim, is that you?

41:30.917 --> 41:32.385
Who are you?

41:32.386 --> 41:35.020
Your friend Timothy
has moved on, Davina.

41:36.556 --> 41:40.093
I'm truly sorry for
what my son did to him.

41:40.094 --> 41:42.161
You're Klaus' father.

41:42.162 --> 41:45.131
And I'm the only one who can
rid you of him forever.

41:45.132 --> 41:46.899
[Speech echoing]

41:46.900 --> 41:49.535
But first, my little witch...

41:49.536 --> 41:51.303
I need you.

41:51.305 --> 41:53.705
What can I do?

41:56.042 --> 41:57.974
You can bring me back to life.
