00:07.040 --> 00:09.960
- Where were you? 
 - It's OK, Frank.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.520
We're waiting for you.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.600
We were supposed to 
 come together.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.560
Oh, yeah. 
 I forgot. Sorry.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.520
Forgot? Great. 
 You know, thanks a lot!

00:17.520 --> 00:19.560
Be careful with that. 
 It's my father's.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.120
I ought to make you eat this!

00:22.120 --> 00:24.520
- What's the big deal? 
 - Well, you see--

00:24.520 --> 00:26.840
All right. Just forget it.

00:26.840 --> 00:30.640
- Poor Frankie lost his flashlight. 
 - Let it go, Eric.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.080
- And what? 
 - And he's afraid of the dark.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.760
- What? 
 - Not Mr. Tough Stuff.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.680
It's OK.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.920
I get scared in the dark 
 sometimes, too.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.080
I'm not afraid of the dark!

00:45.080 --> 00:46.440
I just wasn't sure

00:46.440 --> 00:48.560
I could find the clearing 
 without a flashlight.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.120
- You're gonna pay for this, man! 
 - Don't kill him yet.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.080
- He's telling the story tonight. 
 - Yeah, and it's a good one.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.560
There's a little boy in it 
 who's afraid of the dark.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.280
You're dead meat.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.000
Sit down, Frank. 
 Don't be strange.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.040
- No. I'll stand. 
 - Just tell the story.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.040
Well, everyone knows

01:07.040 --> 01:10.480
that there's nothing in 
 the dark that can hurt you...

01:10.480 --> 01:12.400
most of the time.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.960
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society...

01:17.960 --> 01:21.680
I call this story...

01:21.680 --> 01:23.520
[fire hisses]

01:30.440 --> 01:32.680
[Eric] 
 Andy Carr wasn't doing so hot.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.960
His folks got divorced, and 
 his mom wasn't making much money.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.000
He tried to help her 
 as beat he could,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.960
like with his paper route.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.400
It gave him money 
 to buy lunch at school.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.600
Things were pretty tough.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.160
Then, one day, it looked like 
 his luck changed.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.480
His mom inherited 
 a big old house

01:52.480 --> 01:55.160
from some uncle 
 she could hardly remember--

01:55.160 --> 01:57.520
Just like that. 
 Didn't cost her a dime.

01:57.520 --> 02:01.000
It was kind of old but a lot 
 better than the puny apartment

02:01.000 --> 02:02.960
they lived in.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.560
It really looked like 
 the Carrs' luck was changing,

02:06.560 --> 02:08.919
except there are 
 two kinds of luck,

02:08.919 --> 02:12.400
and you don't always get 
 the kind you want.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.360
Aah!

02:18.320 --> 02:19.720
Hey!

02:21.480 --> 02:24.320
You mess with me, kid, 
 and I'll deck you.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.800
What?

02:25.800 --> 02:28.040
Everybody was glad when 
 your nut-bag uncle kicked.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.120
- Then you had to show up. 
 - I never even met the guy!

02:31.120 --> 02:33.240
You're his family. 
 It's the same thing.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.640
If you get in my face 
 again, you're history.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.240
- Who are you? 
 - I'm your new neighbor.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.080
Welcome to the neighborhood.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.360
[video game beeping]

02:47.360 --> 02:51.000
Oh, I hate these things. 
 They're so stupid.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.880
- Mom? 
 - Yeah?

02:53.880 --> 02:57.480
- What was Uncle Niles like? 
 - I don't remember.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.520
Last time I saw him, 
 I was Christina's age.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.280
This is useless. 
 Do me a favor.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.440
Go down in the basement 
 and see if he had a ladder.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.640
The basement?

03:06.640 --> 03:09.520
Yeah. There's a bunch 
 of junk down there.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.320
Uhh... I don't know.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.440
What's the matter, Andy? 
 Afraid of the dark?

03:14.440 --> 03:17.000
No, I'm not afraid of the dark.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.360
Be careful down there. 
 It's a real mess.

Hey, somebody 
 at the wall switch up there,

05:07.360 --> 05:09.240
I need some power.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.920
[Christina] 
 Do it yourself.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.120

Who's there?

06:09.920 --> 06:11.720
Hello, Andy.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.080
- Come on in. 
 - Aah!

06:15.080 --> 06:17.920
- [crash] 
 - Aah! Mom!

06:20.720 --> 06:22.800
Ooh. 
 Bogeyman in the basement.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.080
I love it.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.240
Uncle Niles may be dead, 
 but he's not forgotten.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.800
- Ooh! 
 - Yeah!

06:29.800 --> 06:32.440
You OK, Frank?

06:32.440 --> 06:34.200
Frank?

06:34.200 --> 06:38.600
- Where'd he go? 
 - I didn't see him leave.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.920
He couldn't take it. 
 I told you he was chicken.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.560
Keep going. 
 He'll come back.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.160
So, anyway, Andy freaked 
 and ran up to get his mom,

06:47.160 --> 06:49.880
and his worst nightmares 
 were coming true.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.280
[Andy] It was in there! 
 It talked to me!

06:52.280 --> 06:54.240
It said, "Come in, 
 and I'll suck your blood,"

06:54.240 --> 06:56.800
- or something like that. 
 - Get lost!

06:56.800 --> 06:58.960
Get back upstairs... now!

06:58.960 --> 07:00.320
Uhh!

07:01.800 --> 07:05.200
It... it was probably 
 a rat or something.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.800
- Rats don't talk. 
 - Good.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.480
I hate rats.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.640
Andy...

07:16.920 --> 07:19.040
Honey, come over here.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.560
It's the root cellar. 
 Ha ha ha!

07:25.560 --> 07:28.960
I swear, Mom. 
 There was something in here!

07:28.960 --> 07:33.360
Well, maybe it was a rat... 
 or the leaky old plumbing.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.480
This house is falling apart.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.680
What's this?

07:41.680 --> 07:44.760
Oh, I was playing 
 with the old radio and...

07:44.760 --> 07:46.760
Well, there's your bogeyman.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.720
Must have been something 
 on the radio.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.240
- [sigh] 
 - I don't know.

07:52.240 --> 07:57.000
Oh, honey, I know it's been tough, 
 but I really need you

07:57.000 --> 07:59.640
to be strong for me right now, OK?

07:59.640 --> 08:02.280
- OK. 
 - Yuck! That's my guy.

08:02.280 --> 08:06.440
Let's get something to eat 
 before Christina gets it all.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.360
And don't give me no lip!

08:27.720 --> 08:30.400
You want an allowance, 
 you earn it!

08:30.400 --> 08:32.559
Yeah, yeah.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.680
Oh, man. 
 You're gonna die.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.400
Man. Oh, man.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.760
You're mine!

- I got you!

09:26.400 --> 09:31.160

 You can't stay in there forever!

Uhh!

10:00.040 --> 10:01.880
I got to be strong.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.000
Boo! 
 What's the matter?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.920
I thought you weren't 
 afraid of the dark.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.160
What are you doing down here?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.080
Playing. 
 Boy, you're such a wuss.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.360
Don't come down here 
 alone anymore.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.520
Yeah. 
 The bogeyman might get me.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.440
[video game beeping]

10:39.040 --> 10:42.480
And now... the fireplace.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.200
- Mom? 
 - Yeah?

10:50.200 --> 10:53.320
Who was Uncle Niles? 
 Like, what did he do?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.400
Oh, he was a stranger guy.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.280
He never left the house 
 but somehow got filthy rich.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.160
Nobody knows where 
 the money came from.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.560
From what I hear, the neighbors 
 didn't like him too much.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.320
They thought he was 
 kind of looney.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.520
- How did he die? 
 - He was old and just stopped living.

11:11.520 --> 11:15.000
They found him in the basement 
 at the bot--

11:15.000 --> 11:18.120
Ha ha ha. 
 Let's chance the subject.

11:18.120 --> 11:22.000

 clothes in the laundry for me, OK?

 - I'm filthy.

 nothing down there.

 Won't you come play with me?

Yeah. Sure.

 Andy was, like, hypnotized.

13:22.920 --> 13:26.000
He didn't remember 
 anything that happened,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.520
which means 
 he didn't know enough

13:28.520 --> 13:32.360
to never go down 
 in the basement again.

Aah! Aah!

19:58.240 --> 19:59.480
[music stops]

19:59.480 --> 20:01.680
Koda?

20:03.600 --> 20:05.000
[door creaks]

20:08.760 --> 20:10.640
Had enough?

20:11.600 --> 20:15.400
You mess with me, 
 I'll do this to you again.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.280
[guitar music playing]

20:55.960 --> 20:59.040
[deep voice] 
 It's yours, Andy.

20:59.040 --> 21:04.720
I'll give you anything you want, 
 just like I did for your uncle.

21:04.720 --> 21:08.760
- Who are you? 
 - [deep voice] Anything you want.

21:08.760 --> 21:12.240
You only have to do one thing.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.440
What's that?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.640
Feed me. Feed me.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.880
[Christina] 
 Andy, I'm home.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.080
Mom says you have to 
 make me dinner,

21:27.080 --> 21:30.400
and it better be good, 
 or you're gonna get it.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.520
[deep voice laughing]

21:39.800 --> 21:43.480
He didn't feed his own sister 
 to the thing, did he?

21:43.480 --> 21:46.360
No, but he made sure that 
 she didn't bother him anymore.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.560
Cool.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.800
I'd have done it. 
 The little brat deserved it.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.600
Great story, Eric.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.520
Well, it's getting late. 
 We got to go.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.680
I declare this meeting 
 of the Midnight Society closed.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.720
Hey, where's Frank 
 with my father's flashlight?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.560
I got to take that thing home.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.440
So wait for him. 
 He'll be back.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.120
Wait? Here? Alone?

22:16.120 --> 22:19.200
Why can't you 
 wait with me, Kristen?

22:19.200 --> 22:22.800
What's the matter, Eric? 
 Afraid of the dark?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.160
Hey, no problem. 
 I'll wait.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.320
I am not afraid of the dark.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.080
I'm not afraid of the dark.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.480
Frank! 
 Frank, let's go!

22:42.480 --> 22:44.680
It's getting late! 
 Come on!

22:47.160 --> 22:50.040
[softly] 
 # I'm not afraid of the dark #

22:50.040 --> 22:52.480
# I'm not afraid of the dark #

22:52.480 --> 22:54.080
Aah!

22:54.080 --> 22:56.120
Paybacks are sweet!
