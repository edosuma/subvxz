WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.137
Okay.
Time for gifts.

00:02.202 --> 00:05.979
We have gift certificates
for facials for everybody.

00:06.039 --> 00:09.213
Then, you are going to get a needlepoint
pillow with your face on it

00:09.275 --> 00:12.051
and the lead headline from a
newspaper on the day you were born.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.853
"Josef Stalin Dies"?

00:13.913 --> 00:15.688
That's right, Mom.
And you replaced him.

00:15.882 --> 00:19.762
Not in terms of genocide. Just in
terms of, you know, being on Earth.

00:19.819 --> 00:23.289
February 14th, Valentine's
Day, is about romance.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.599
But February 13th,
Galentine's Day

00:26.659 --> 00:28.661
is about celebrating
lady friends.

00:28.728 --> 00:31.208
It's wonderful, and it should
be a national holiday.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.367
It should be
a national holiday.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.181
"Dear Congress.
It's Leslie again."

00:37.337 --> 00:39.339
Let's talk about
personal relationships.

00:39.406 --> 00:40.578
Who wants to start? Donna?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.483
I have several men
in rotation.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.250
One's waiting for me
out in the car.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.018
Don't worry.
I rolled down the window.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.720
April, you're the old married broad here.
How's Andy?

00:49.783 --> 00:52.127
Well, last week,
he was supposed to buy gas,

00:52.185 --> 00:54.495
but instead, he bought
novelty cookie cutters.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.864
Now, everything we eat
is shaped like a dinosaur.

00:56.923 --> 00:57.958
He's amazing.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.963
Great. And, Mom,
how is it going with Steven?

01:01.027 --> 01:03.007
Well, I met him
on the Internet

01:03.063 --> 01:05.942
because of my
lovely daughter.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.001
And we are

01:09.069 --> 01:10.548
compatible.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.414
Okay, no, no, no.
Ann, can you start talking?

01:13.473 --> 01:16.249
Well, I'm in a bit
of a lull right now.

01:16.309 --> 01:17.845
But I'm so glad
that you all

01:17.911 --> 01:20.323
have people in your lives
that you care about,

01:20.380 --> 01:21.620
so congrats.

01:22.782 --> 01:25.695
It's really hard to say "congrats"
without sounding sarcastic.

01:26.086 --> 01:30.626
Seriously, I really hope you guys
are all very happy. Damn it.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.691
We are.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.746 --> 01:56.352
Ann, I just wanted to say I'm
sorry if I put you on the spot

01:56.416 --> 01:57.724
when I asked you
about your love life.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.223
How are you doing?

01:59.285 --> 02:01.993
You know, I'm mostly
fine being single.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.729
It's just this time of year,
with the hearts and roses,

02:04.791 --> 02:06.668
it just gets me
a little down.

02:06.926 --> 02:10.499
But Galentine's Day made me feel better.
So thanks.

02:11.431 --> 02:15.106
Oh, Ann. You beautiful spinster.
I will find you love.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.607
What? Did you say something?
I love you.

02:18.171 --> 02:21.675
Thank you all for being here.
Let's get started.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.217
Wow.
Great attitude, Ron.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.819
Sorry. I was talking
to these ribs.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.421
Okay. So the
Valentine's Day dance

02:30.483 --> 02:32.258
is planned, prepped
and under budget.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.696
But we have
one final task.

02:35.021 --> 02:38.127
Ann Perkins is currently attending
the Valentine's Day dance alone.

02:38.191 --> 02:42.162
So I need each one of you to bring an
eligible bachelor for her tomorrow.

02:42.228 --> 02:45.004
Ann's not totally hideous.
Why does she need our help?

02:45.064 --> 02:46.566
Because that's
what friends do, April.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.670
They help friends
find happiness.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.371
Now, the last guy
she liked was Chris.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.746
But she can't date him again
because he's her boss.

02:52.805 --> 02:54.910
So when we're thinking
of prospective sweethearts,

02:54.974 --> 02:57.921
we need to think of
people who are

02:57.977 --> 03:01.356
attractive and
smart and kind.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.087
And if you're wondering what
kind of guy is right for Ann,

03:03.149 --> 03:05.254
all you need to do is ask.

03:05.585 --> 03:09.192
Also, you need to find someone
educated and friendly and fun.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.700
Just tell us
the damn word.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.500
Effervescent.
He needs to be effervescent.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.096
Quick question
about Ann.

03:15.161 --> 03:18.005
Does anyone know if she
has any Indian in her?

03:18.064 --> 03:20.066
No one respond.
No one say anything.

03:20.133 --> 03:23.808
Why? I'm just curious if Ann
has a little Indian in her.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.405
Silence.

03:25.471 --> 03:26.541
I don't think
she does.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.483
- Would she like some?
- Jerry!

03:29.209 --> 03:33.157
Happy Valentine's Day and...

03:35.014 --> 03:36.789
Yachter Otter?
Yep.

03:36.849 --> 03:40.160
Two months ago, I have a dream
about a playboy otter lost at sea,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.858
and you make him real?

03:42.121 --> 03:44.397
I love it.
I thought we had agreed

03:44.457 --> 03:45.993
that we weren't going to
get each other presents

03:46.059 --> 03:48.437
because we were too busy with the campaign.
I got you something too.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.268
Oh. A bomb?

03:52.332 --> 03:54.744
It is a cryptex, like in that
movie The Da Vinci Code,

03:54.801 --> 03:57.611
which was the first movie that you
and I ever watched on Starz HD.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.672
Wow. That's specific.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.549
Inside, it will tell you where
to meet me at 9:00 p.m. tonight.

04:02.609 --> 04:05.021
And the combination
is a five-letter code

04:05.078 --> 04:08.059
that captures the essence
of our third date.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.791
Yeah.
So I will see you tonight.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.295
Okay. Unless you can't
crack the code.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.497
I think I can
crack the code.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.563
I have no idea
what the code is.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.938
Hey, man, you okay?
Still thinking about your ex?

04:23.396 --> 04:26.536
Millicent Gergich
has literally

04:27.300 --> 04:29.439
torn my heart
from my body,

04:29.502 --> 04:33.575
and replaced it with
a thick slab of sadness.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.712
I may never smile again.

04:37.910 --> 04:43.758
Cool. So I found a DJ for the dance
and his name is D.J. Bluntz.

04:44.384 --> 04:47.297
Tom, this is a publicly
funded couples dance.

04:47.353 --> 04:51.460
I don't think it's appropriate for
people to be "getting wet with sound."

04:51.958 --> 04:53.198
Who's going to do it, then?

04:53.259 --> 04:56.069
I will. I certainly have no
other plans for Valentine's Day

04:56.129 --> 04:58.609
because I am
completely alone.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.104
All right.
I'll see you later, Chris.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.710
Oh, cool cryptex.
Can I have it?

05:05.772 --> 05:07.752
Hey. No. No, you can't.
Where did you get it?

05:07.807 --> 05:09.309
How do you know
what a cryptex is?

05:09.609 --> 05:11.054
I know what things are.

05:11.277 --> 05:14.417
Well, Leslie hid the location of our
Valentine's meeting place in here.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.221
No. I've tried every
five-letter word

05:16.282 --> 05:18.421
that has anything to do
with our third date.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.695
Have you tried...

05:21.621 --> 05:23.157
That's a four-letter word.

05:23.923 --> 05:26.164
Add an "S"? I really
don't think it's that.

05:26.225 --> 05:27.863
I wish I could help you, bro.
I don't know if I can.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.873
You're like the second
smartest guy I know.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.407
You should go to the first
smartest guy I know.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.309
Okay.
So the clue is inside,

05:34.367 --> 05:37.610
but it takes the five-letter
code to open it. Andy...

05:38.471 --> 05:39.848
Did you try...

05:40.573 --> 05:42.814
Yes. Why is that
everyone's first suggestion?

05:42.875 --> 05:46.254
Just smart people. I think I
might be able to help you.

05:46.312 --> 05:47.416
Told you.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.826
Let me see it.
Yeah, you're going to see it.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.955
I'll show you.
I can unroll it.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.425
"The murals with
this heart you see.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.503
"Look to the first, and there
your next clue will be."

05:59.559 --> 06:02.130
The first letter of the name of
each mural with a heart on it

06:02.195 --> 06:03.538
will spell out the clue.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.103
Or something.
Let's check out the murals.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.904
Happy Valentine's Day,
Pawnee.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.377
For me,
it is not happy.

06:12.438 --> 06:15.942
But don't let my sadness
diminish your night.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.648
Anyway,
life is fleeting.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.458
Leslie,
I found a date for Ann.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.928
Jerry, well done.
I put an ad on Craigslist.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.989
"Man seeking man
for a night of casual fun."

06:29.055 --> 06:30.659
Enrico,
he responded right away.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.168
I'll meet you inside. Okay.
Okay.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.363
Thanks, dude.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.972
You hired a male escort.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.342
A what? Please get your
gigolo out of here.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.405
Oh, my God.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.905
Okay. So we've got all the ones from
this side with the heart sticker.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.883
All right. The ones from the other
hallway are "Cornfield Slaughter,"

06:49.942 --> 06:52.115
"Lament of the Buffalo,"

06:52.178 --> 06:53.714
"Needless Slaughter,"

06:53.780 --> 06:55.020
"Slaughter Gone Wrong,"

06:55.081 --> 06:56.560
"Eating the Reverend,"

06:56.616 --> 06:59.756
"It's Raining Blood"
and "Death Everywhere."

06:59.819 --> 07:00.854
Great.
I got it from here.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.730
Thanks, guys. I hope I didn't screw
up your Valentine's Day too much.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.031
No. Oh, God, no.
April hates Valentine's Day.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.868
And brunch and
outside and smiling.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.332
She's weird.

07:11.397 --> 07:12.398
I figured it out.

07:12.498 --> 07:19.143
The letters unscrambled say, "No food finer.
Clue three at J.J.'s Diner."

07:19.205 --> 07:20.980
How many clues
are there, exactly?

07:23.676 --> 07:26.247
Hey, you're here.
And I brought a bachelor.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.281
Are you kidding me?
No.

07:28.347 --> 07:31.817
You brought Orin? Ann is not
some weird morose mummy.

07:31.884 --> 07:33.363
Offense intended, Orin.

07:33.419 --> 07:34.921
Let this be
a wake-up call

07:34.987 --> 07:37.024
about the way you present
yourself to the world.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.762
I think Ann and him
would be cute together.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.270
I asked you
to do one thing.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.600
Do you know how hard
I've been working

07:41.661 --> 07:43.663
to try to pull this together
before Ann gets here?

07:43.729 --> 07:44.901
Hey.
Hey, you're here.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.807
We weren't talking about you.
How are you?

07:46.866 --> 07:50.609
Well, it's Valentine's Day and I'm
single and I'm at a couples dance.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.581
I can't imagine a more
depressing place to be.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.215
What about a wedding where you
used to go out with the groom

07:55.274 --> 07:56.753
and you're the only one there
without a date,

07:56.809 --> 07:59.517
so the bride makes you dance
to Single Ladies by yourself?

07:59.579 --> 08:00.785
Oh, my God!
Did that happen to you?

08:00.847 --> 08:02.019
Maybe. Let's get a drink.

08:02.081 --> 08:05.028
And then, you and I are
going to have some F-U-N.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.355
Well, at least
the music seems about right.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.266
There were supposed to
be, like, 20 guys here for Ann,

08:13.326 --> 08:14.532
and there's only four.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.200
Who else do we have?
Ben, taken. Jerry, taken.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.401
Oh!

08:18.464 --> 08:21.934
My dentist is 80,
and he's gay and he's taken.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.743
What's this? "P Hut."

08:23.803 --> 08:25.749
Pizza Hut. Hold on.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.310
Hi. How cute are you?

08:31.577 --> 08:33.682
Ann, this is my
lawyer friend, Alex.

08:33.746 --> 08:34.884
Hi.
Hi.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.448
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.996
I've heard a lot about you
in the last hour.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.224
Yeah. Well, Alex gives
my campaign legal advice,

08:41.287 --> 08:43.732
and Ann is the greatest
human being ever invented.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.531
So I'm going to... What? Someone needs me.
I'm going to go.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.594
And you two
just hit it off now.

08:48.661 --> 08:49.969
You crazy kids.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.372
Okay.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.868
Okay.
"There is no food finer."

08:55.935 --> 08:59.178
For Leslie, that means
whipped cream or...

08:59.238 --> 09:00.649
No, it's whipped cream.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.549
Everyone, look in the
whipped cream cans.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.418
Oh, got some.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.657
Nothing yet.

09:13.619 --> 09:18.693
Okay. "Something wicked this way comes,
whence you peruse a book with your thumbs.

09:18.758 --> 09:23.036
"Go to the one who succumbs. I'll
be attached with a little gum."

09:23.095 --> 09:24.267
Come on, Leslie.
Give me a break.

09:24.330 --> 09:28.676
I hate riddles and other such nonsense.
I want that on the record.

09:29.068 --> 09:33.676
But something wicked with a book
is my ex-wife from the library.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.116
Which means
I'm the one that succumbs.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.785
"I'll be attached
with a little gum."

09:38.377 --> 09:41.017
Good God.
That woman is good.

09:41.247 --> 09:45.218
"Follow me to the sheltered snow.
Only 22 clues left to go."

09:45.284 --> 09:46.592
22?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.495
Well, this is the woman
I've chosen to love.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.298
Well, I guess there's nothing to
do but spend the entire night

09:53.359 --> 09:54.804
methodically
solving this puzzle.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.897
There's no way
we'll finish in time.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.569
Okay. I'll just make a list of
places she and I have been together

09:59.632 --> 10:02.374
and hope we luck out
and find the last clue.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.574
We'll split up,
cover more ground. Move.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.979
Hey, Chris-Cross.
Can we change up the music?

10:12.078 --> 10:15.685
It kind of sounds like the end of a
movie about a monk who killed himself.

10:15.748 --> 10:16.749
It is.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.194
Listen, man. There's some
attractive women here.

10:19.251 --> 10:20.525
Why don't you rebound?

10:20.586 --> 10:22.429
Nobody here
compares to Millicent.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.630
Except maybe Jerry.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.967
Technically, they share
50% of the same DNA.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.609
Stop staring
at Jerry like that.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.544
I don't know.
It's working now.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.754
Hey. How's it going?
It's Valentine's Day.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.160
And I'm working the late shift
at the snow globe museum,

10:50.216 --> 10:51.786
so I'm right
where I want to be.

10:51.851 --> 10:57.164
Okay. My girlfriend left a clue here,
I think, like, for a scavenger hunt?

10:57.223 --> 10:59.294
Right, you're Ben.
Yes.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.996
She said you'd
be here by noon.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.671
You're not doing so good. All right.
Well, thanks, Kevin.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.074
I'm supposed to tell you that it's
under one of the snow globes.

11:07.199 --> 11:10.180
But which one?
Oh, I don't know.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.215
Nope. Nope.

11:15.908 --> 11:16.943
You really suck at this.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.455
Okay. Why don't you just tell me where
it is, and I can get out of here?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.923
That would take
all the fun out of it.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.453
Winner.

11:23.582 --> 11:24.822
I found it.
Yep.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.560
Oh, wait. No, that might be
from another scavenger hunt.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.762
Ann. Looks like
you've already met Jeff.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.031
Well, you didn't tell me that
your friend was so beautiful.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.534
Oh! Thanks, Jeff.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.473
Not as beautiful as my sister,
but you know the law.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.045
No. No, Jeff.
What?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.869
How am I supposed to
find the love of Ann's life

11:43.936 --> 11:45.415
when it sounds
like a funeral in here?

11:45.471 --> 11:47.246
There's no changing it as
long as Chris is depressed.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.513
All right. I'm going to go talk to Chris.
You go help Ann.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.111
She's not responding
to my top candidates.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.656
So we're going to have to
go with some wildcards.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.090
Got it. And, April.
Thanks for nothing.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.558
Why should I do
anything to help her?

11:56.615 --> 11:59.494
Because despite the fact that all
you do is give her a hard time,

11:59.552 --> 12:01.031
she would do this for you.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.700
Just go hide under the table
with your friend Orin.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.662
Yeah, I see you, weirdo.

12:08.394 --> 12:12.240
So Leslie dragged you into this
sneaky little fix-up scheme, huh?

12:12.598 --> 12:15.841
We're stuck at a Parks and Rec community couples event.
What else you got to do?

12:15.901 --> 12:19.371
What the hell. You're right.
Bring them on, Tom.

12:19.438 --> 12:22.783
I'm Harris. I heard you were
desperate for a man piece.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.048
We in business?

12:24.143 --> 12:26.714
He's 33 years old,
still lives with his parents,

12:26.779 --> 12:29.988
and he's been to at
least 200 Phish concerts.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.759
Try 308.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.091
I'm going to have
to pass right now.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.460
Your mistake, mama.

12:34.520 --> 12:39.492
So, Bill, this stunning woman
saves lives for a living.

12:39.558 --> 12:40.593
What do you bring
to the table?

12:40.993 --> 12:43.030
Where to begin?
I'm an amateur juggler.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.302
Nope, you shouldn't
have begun there. Get out.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.072
No one's trying to get with jugglers.
Thanks for playing.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.745
Hello. My name
is Ron Swanson.

12:58.811 --> 13:03.317
I believe Leslie Knope may have left
some kind of scavenger hunt clue here.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.293
She did. One second.

13:10.422 --> 13:11.594
Gentlemen.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.871
Enjoy your evening.

13:17.663 --> 13:20.735
Well, they always say break
glass in case of an emergency.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.980
Wait a second.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.614
Well, there we go.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.150
Hey, Chris. What do you think
about changing the music?

13:35.314 --> 13:36.452
Sure.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.897
Hey, you know what? You should
look on the bright side.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.833
I'm sure that Millicent couldn't
keep up with you on your runs.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.961
So, now, you can
go full speed again.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.768
On the contrary,
she was faster than I was.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.743
I set many personal bests just
trying to keep up with her.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.143
Which is what
I'm worried about.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.344
What if she was
my personal best?

13:59.405 --> 14:01.783
No. Your best
is still ahead of you.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.287
I am 44 years old.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.788
You don't look
a day over 30.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.051
Most people say 25.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.716
Who says that?
A lot of people.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.886
You don't think that
Millicent was my soul mate?

14:10.950 --> 14:13.328
There are a lot of
soul mates in the world.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.764
I mean, look at Ann. You dated her,
and she's a perfect human specimen.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.530
And you tossed her out
like day-old chowder.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.071
But it's going to be okay.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.574
Buck up.
Thanks. I'll try.

14:37.910 --> 14:38.945
Hey.

14:39.011 --> 14:42.618
Hey. How is your evening unfolding in
terms of your conversations with men?

14:42.681 --> 14:44.991
I have met a lot of
different guys tonight.

14:45.050 --> 14:49.021
How lucky that that happened
to you on Valentine's Day.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.295
What's lucky is that
I have a best friend

14:51.357 --> 14:54.304
who'd spend her Valentine's
Day trying to find me a date.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.340
Thank you.
I'm going to go home.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.601
No. Stay.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.768
I just... I'm going to go
home and watch TV.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.904
Okay. Can you just do me a favor and
give me your car keys for a second?

15:02.968 --> 15:04.948
There's something I need to
look at on your car keys.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.280
You're going to throw them on the
roof again so I can't leave.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.080
You know me too well.
You're the best.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.316
It sucks being
alone on Valentine's Day.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.257
So I'm going to take
Ann out for a drink.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.421
You know, try to cheer her up.
And I can be late meeting Ben.

15:19.718 --> 15:22.892
He's not going to be on time
because those clues are hard.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.766
They're really, really hard.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.360
And I'm really worried that he's not
going to be able to figure it out.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.507
Ann, you tricky bastard.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.515
Leslie?
What are you doing?

15:39.571 --> 15:41.346
Look at Ann.
She's putting on makeup.

15:41.407 --> 15:44.388
She's using the emergency mini
curling iron that I gave her.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.423
She has a date.
You don't know that.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.549
Why wouldn't she
tell me who it is?

15:49.415 --> 15:50.894
Because she doesn't
want me to know.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.952
Because it's someone
she shouldn't be dating. Wait.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.362
The music is better.
Have you seen Chris?

15:55.421 --> 15:57.924
I don't know. Maybe he's in
the bathroom or something.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.362
She's going to meet Chris.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.109
Hey. So, I got nine,
three and four.

16:07.166 --> 16:11.615
I have 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18 and 19.

16:11.670 --> 16:12.808
Whoa.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.316
I got... I got lucky.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.852
And I love riddles.

16:16.408 --> 16:19.184
Yo. I found some clues.
Also found this.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.691
Weird stick.
Might be a clue?

16:22.748 --> 16:23.749
No.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.818
Okay. Did you find
the 25th clue?

16:25.884 --> 16:28.296
No, I got number eight
and number 22.

16:33.392 --> 16:34.496
What do you want, April?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.369
Leave Ann alone. This is
none of your business.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.567
After all the hoops that Ben
and I had to jump through

16:38.630 --> 16:42.305
because of the boss-employee thing,
it is absolutely my business.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.370
Chris needs
to explain himself.

16:44.436 --> 16:47.383
And Ann lied to me
about this date.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.646
I mean,
so many injustices.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.416
Ann would never do anything
to piss you off, Leslie.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.081
You guys are
such close friends.

16:54.146 --> 16:57.150
It's lame. Just have a nice night
with Ben and forget about this.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.320
Okay, fine.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.555
I will let it go for now.

17:00.652 --> 17:03.189
But I want you to know
that I think there is some...

17:04.923 --> 17:06.128
Okay, she hung up on me.

17:08.993 --> 17:12.498
We failed. If I'd just
had a little more time.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.977
She's waiting for me somewhere in
Pawnee and I'm not going to be there.

17:16.335 --> 17:18.246
Wait.
Leslie loves romance,

17:18.303 --> 17:19.906
but she also
loves being right.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.077
Is there something
you used to disagree on,

17:22.141 --> 17:24.519
but you've since come around
to her way of thinking?

17:26.678 --> 17:27.884
Ron, you're a genius.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.792
- Li'l Sebastian.
- Yep.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.732
At first, you did not understand what
made this tiny horse so special.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.098
And now, you love him
more than I do.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.195
Yep. I miss him every day.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.167
I really tried to make that hard.
Yeah.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.903
I'm very impressed with you Some
of them were kind of tough.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.972
So, are you ready to go have our
first ever Valentine's dinner?

17:51.036 --> 17:52.777
Yes. But I have
to tell you something.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.284
Chris and Ann are
on a secret date.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.252
Which is crazy
because he's her boss,

17:58.310 --> 18:00.153
which is the exact
situation we were in,

18:00.212 --> 18:02.283
except we were
put on trial for it.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.486
And I know I'm not supposed to care.
And I should just let it go

18:04.550 --> 18:06.427
and we should just have a
romantic dinner, but this is...

18:06.485 --> 18:09.227
No, we have to go catch them
in the act right now.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.631
Really?
Yeah.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.032
Screw romantic dinners.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.731
Let's go rub it in their face.
God, I love you so much.

18:16.161 --> 18:19.836
I cannot wait to see the look on
Chris' remarkably youthful face

18:19.965 --> 18:21.945
when we march in there
and confront them.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.240
Leslie.

18:26.238 --> 18:27.512
What?

18:31.610 --> 18:32.782
April.

18:33.011 --> 18:34.115
Hey.
April.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.856
Tom and Ann are on a date.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.326
I know.
What do you mean you know?

18:38.383 --> 18:39.418
How do you know?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.123
Because I set them up.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.970
I was watching Ann
with Tom at the dance

18:47.025 --> 18:48.971
and she seemed to be
having a good time.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.938
So I went over
and talked to her.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.203
What are you looking
for in a date, anyway?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.403
I don't know.
What does anyone want?

18:55.467 --> 19:00.314
Just a nice, funny guy who
likes me and treats me well.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.186
Tom's funny.
And he'd treat you well.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.585
Ha-ha.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.021
I'm serious.
You want a good date?

19:07.079 --> 19:09.889
Why not ask out the only guy
that's made you smile tonight?

19:09.948 --> 19:12.929
He's ridiculous.
All that dumb swagger?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.089
It's an act.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.224
He's sweet. You should just
ask him out for a drink.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.332
I'm 1,000% sure
he'd say yes.

19:19.758 --> 19:21.760
I bet you guys would
have a good time.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.634
Man. I need to, like,
wrap my head around this.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.232
Why?
It makes sense to me.

19:26.298 --> 19:29.245
This is a small loser town
with loser people,

19:29.301 --> 19:31.577
and Tom's, like,
at least semi-cool.

19:31.637 --> 19:32.775
You know what I'm hearing?

19:33.572 --> 19:36.746
You tried to make Ann happy
for Valentine's Day.

19:38.544 --> 19:39.852
You're a very nice person.
No.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.858
Yes, you are. A very nice person.
Bye.

19:44.483 --> 19:47.487
Okay. I do not understand this.
This really confuses me.

19:47.553 --> 19:48.930
Well, you do
love them both.

19:48.987 --> 19:52.901
Yeah, but I love passionate
speakers and Italian men.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.301
Doesn't mean
I love Mussolini.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.633
You love Italian men?

19:55.894 --> 19:59.501
Not as much as Irish.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.410
Scottish? White.
Whatever you are.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.240
This is the weirdest
Valentine's Day ever.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.916
So, Ann.
It's finally happening.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.117
Dude, this is so close
to falling apart.

20:16.181 --> 20:17.717
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.827
Can I be honest, though?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.454
I'm a little freaked out.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.467
Like, I don't really
understand what's going on.

20:25.123 --> 20:26.295
This is what's going on.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.338
We're going to have a drink,
and we're going to talk,

20:29.394 --> 20:30.771
get to know each other.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.935
And then, I am going
to drive home alone.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.774
Cool. Consider
this alternate plan.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.110
We grab drinks here, get to
know each other, whatever.

20:38.170 --> 20:42.448
Then, we go back to my place and
snuggle up like little bunnies.

20:42.507 --> 20:43.713
Yeah, this was a mistake.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.083
No!

20:48.113 --> 20:50.821
Leslie, thanks to your
annoying prying last year,

20:50.882 --> 20:53.192
I'm sure you remember
my birthday's coming up.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.493
I know, I know. No parties.
You hate parties.

20:55.554 --> 20:56.692
Correct.

20:57.723 --> 20:58.793
Oh.

20:58.857 --> 21:02.805
You know that wild goose chase you
sent Ben on for Valentine's Day?

21:02.861 --> 21:04.067
The scavenger hunt?

21:04.129 --> 21:07.133
I also do not want that.
Yup. I understand.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.542
I absolutely do not want

21:08.600 --> 21:12.446
to solve a series of riddles and clues,
each more intricate than the last.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.281
You understand what I'm saying?
Yeah. I got it, Ron.

21:15.507 --> 21:16.611
Good.

21:21.046 --> 21:23.959
I do want that.
Please do that for me.
