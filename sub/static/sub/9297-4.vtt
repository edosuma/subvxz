WEBVTT

00:03.959 --> 00:05.422
***

00:05.600 --> 00:08.760
Yeah, I knew the beginning part,
so I felt good about that.

00:10.231 --> 00:11.333
Mm-hmm.

00:11.334 --> 00:13.604
Well, I didn't have enough
time for both of the essays,

00:13.605 --> 00:16.524
but I still think
I did really well.

00:19.714 --> 00:21.604
I'll call you back.

00:27.586 --> 00:29.058
I think what we're
looking for in...

00:29.097 --> 00:31.243
hey, everybody.
Right this way. Right...

00:32.317 --> 00:33.893
single file.

00:33.927 --> 00:35.406
Oh, crap.

00:36.345 --> 00:39.725
I forgot today was her annual
career-day dog-and-pony show.

00:39.759 --> 00:40.829
Detective Rizzoli,

00:40.863 --> 00:41.782
these are the students

00:41.783 --> 00:43.722
from the Elizabeth
bishop middle school.

00:43.757 --> 00:46.699
Are we almost done?
I've got a lot of homework.

00:49.605 --> 00:51.274
Who here wants to be a detective?

00:53.753 --> 00:55.495
They must all want to be doctors.

00:55.496 --> 00:57.965
I wanted to go to
Tweenbeat magazine,

00:57.966 --> 00:59.368
but that was full.

01:00.081 --> 01:01.144
Okay.

01:01.145 --> 01:03.795
Well, welcome.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.900
Over here, uh, we have a...

01:07.935 --> 01:10.307
a shoe print from a crime scene.

01:10.341 --> 01:12.739
So we made a plaster cast...

01:12.774 --> 01:14.009
was it a murder?

01:14.534 --> 01:16.079
Uh, yes.

01:16.113 --> 01:18.582
Awesome. Was it disgusting?

01:23.122 --> 01:24.323
What's that?

01:24.358 --> 01:25.823
That's the shot alert.

01:26.455 --> 01:28.089
And that computer software

01:28.123 --> 01:30.827
can triangulate the
sound of a gunshot

01:30.861 --> 01:33.066
and find its precise location.

01:36.372 --> 01:39.307
Gunshots at Boston
Cambridge university.

01:39.341 --> 01:40.508
What?!

01:40.543 --> 01:42.343
Awesome. Somebody else is dead.

01:42.377 --> 01:44.345
Wait, no, Jane, I'm going with you.

01:44.379 --> 01:46.081
BCU is my Alma mater.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.451
What about them?

01:49.654 --> 01:52.256
They...Wanted to be at some
tween magazine, anyway.

01:53.159 --> 01:54.493
Let's go find your parents.

01:58.834 --> 02:01.037
Ugh. Speaking of parents...

02:01.071 --> 02:02.973
What is it, ma?

02:03.007 --> 02:04.909
No, I can't. I'm working.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.019 --> 02:17.120
Your father left me stranded
on the side of the road.

02:17.155 --> 02:18.856
Just get in the car, ma.

02:24.564 --> 02:27.701
I'm sure he got stuck at
a job or something, okay?

02:27.735 --> 02:29.937
Why do you always take his side?

02:31.290 --> 02:32.331
Here we go.

02:33.169 --> 02:34.436
I'm not taking his side.

02:34.470 --> 02:36.371
He's too busy to fix my car.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.107
He's got so many other
better things to do!

02:39.142 --> 02:41.944
Can we talk about this
when I'm not working?

02:51.222 --> 02:53.357
So, you know, I never told you,

02:53.391 --> 02:56.027
but I'd be really
good at solving cases.

02:56.061 --> 02:59.530
Well, the forensic sciences
can be quite complicated.

02:59.565 --> 03:02.166
A little common sense
goes a long way.

03:02.201 --> 03:04.302
I've read so many crime novels,

03:04.337 --> 03:05.949
and I always know who did it.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.906
Thank you, Agatha christie.

03:09.409 --> 03:11.210
Stay in the car.

03:11.244 --> 03:13.045
I won't embarrass you.

03:13.079 --> 03:16.549
30 years of experience
says otherwise.

03:21.555 --> 03:24.390
College campuses are like
a foreign country to me.

03:24.425 --> 03:26.059
You went to junior college.

03:26.060 --> 03:28.561
That's like 13th, 14th grade.

03:28.596 --> 03:30.964
But, Jane, you know so much.

03:30.998 --> 03:33.801
So why doesn't it feel like enough?

03:49.329 --> 03:50.863
Oh, hey! Ho! Ho! Ho!

03:50.897 --> 03:53.165
You're trampling on a
crime scene. You got tape?

03:53.199 --> 03:54.333
No, ma'am.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.667
Go into my car.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.536
In the trunk, there's tape. Get it.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.573
And, hey, tell the woman
who's in there to stay put.

04:01.051 --> 04:02.355
In the...Trunk?

04:03.811 --> 04:04.844
No, in the car!

04:08.015 --> 04:10.711
White female, approximately 20.

04:10.712 --> 04:12.848
Gunshot wound to the chest.

04:17.555 --> 04:19.589
No vitals.

04:19.624 --> 04:22.391
Barney fife was first on scene?

04:22.426 --> 04:23.659
Yeah.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.227
No witnesses.

04:26.261 --> 04:28.729
Broad daylight, thousands
of students, no witnesses?

04:28.763 --> 04:32.931
Hey, they're all taking finals.
And look where she is.

04:32.965 --> 04:34.765
You wanna go back to being
partners, just say so.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.400
Can you please get a gun dog

04:36.434 --> 04:38.368
and look through all the dumpsters,

04:38.402 --> 04:40.170
the trash cans, and the bushes?

04:45.451 --> 04:47.982
Padding for a laptop,
but no computer.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.909
Maybe she didn't have one.

04:50.711 --> 04:52.545
Nobody really goes to
college without one.

04:52.579 --> 04:54.013
Maybe the shooter stole it.

04:58.018 --> 04:59.685
"Danielle Davis."

04:59.719 --> 05:02.088
Hey, hey, hey.
Have her dorm room sealed off.

05:03.357 --> 05:05.691
Look at this.

05:09.194 --> 05:10.328
Maybe it's hers.

05:11.564 --> 05:13.031
All the texts have been deleted.

05:13.065 --> 05:14.766
Get a subpoena to the d.A.'S office

05:14.800 --> 05:16.467
for her phone records, all right?

05:18.904 --> 05:21.639
A piece of plastic.

05:25.277 --> 05:27.478
Get this to the crime lab.

05:27.513 --> 05:28.813
No. No, no.

05:28.847 --> 05:30.313
No, no, no, no.

05:30.348 --> 05:31.548
You look like my mother,

05:31.582 --> 05:34.150
but she's supposed to be
waiting for me in the car.

05:34.151 --> 05:35.718
It's a tragedy.

05:37.454 --> 05:38.821
She's somebody's baby.

05:39.623 --> 05:41.190
How do you do this every day?

05:41.225 --> 05:43.292
Okay, I'm gonna have
a unit take you home.

05:45.192 --> 05:46.162
It's senseless.

05:46.196 --> 05:48.263
Yes, it is. Go on.

05:48.298 --> 05:49.932
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

05:49.966 --> 05:51.767
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

05:55.235 --> 05:58.236
Okay. Okay. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

05:59.238 --> 06:01.238
Just stay right here, okay?

06:01.273 --> 06:04.040
Right here. Right here.
Did you know her?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.542
She's my best friend!

06:06.576 --> 06:08.677
When was the last time you saw her?

06:10.848 --> 06:14.450
We had lunch yesterday
at south campus...

06:14.485 --> 06:16.119
Okay.

06:16.153 --> 06:17.553
Is there anybody you can think of

06:17.588 --> 06:19.054
that would have reason to do this?

06:20.590 --> 06:22.524
Did she have a boyfriend?

06:22.558 --> 06:25.125
She wasn't seeing anyone.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.495
I can't believe she's gone!

06:28.529 --> 06:31.397
I'm sorry. Okay. All right.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.433
No computer.
Somebody's got her laptop.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.441
Wonder what this opens?

07:24.610 --> 07:26.610
Uh, her locker at the gym.

07:27.546 --> 07:30.647
I'm Lucas Bilton.
I was Danielle's r.A.

07:30.681 --> 07:33.115
Resident advisor.
They look after kids in the dorm.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.120
How well did you know her?

07:39.155 --> 07:40.922
Not that well.

07:41.731 --> 07:42.963
She ever come by and talk to you

07:42.964 --> 07:44.158
about having a
problem with anybody?

07:44.193 --> 07:47.194
She stopped by once or
twice about classes.

07:47.228 --> 07:50.163
She was usually either
studying or playing soccer.

07:50.197 --> 07:51.331
All right.

07:51.926 --> 07:53.677
Here's my card.

07:53.678 --> 07:56.101
If you think of anything,
can you give me a call, please?

08:03.508 --> 08:05.742
I'm Danielle's father.

08:10.803 --> 08:13.635
She wanted to get into BCU
since she was a little kid.

08:14.815 --> 08:17.619
The day she found out was
the best day of her life.

08:17.653 --> 08:20.555
When was the last time you
spoke to your daughter?

08:22.624 --> 08:24.158
Two days ago.

08:24.192 --> 08:25.759
She, uh,

08:25.794 --> 08:28.295
she sounded pretty tired,
but she had a lot on her plate.

08:28.329 --> 08:31.664
Straight-a student.
Played division-I soccer.

08:31.698 --> 08:33.698
They recruited her.
Full scholarship.

08:33.732 --> 08:36.034
You must have been
very proud of her.

08:36.068 --> 08:39.503
Oh, her mother and I
were very proud, yeah.

08:39.537 --> 08:41.871
Her mother died when she was 15.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.128
I didn't know how I was gonna
be able to afford to send her.

08:48.713 --> 08:51.748
She did it all herself.

08:57.686 --> 09:00.119
Would you like one of my
officers to drive you home?

09:00.154 --> 09:02.421
Yeah.

09:03.356 --> 09:06.424
I just want you to find out
who did this to my baby.

09:14.435 --> 09:18.035
2-centimeter, singular
gunshot wound, mid-chest.

09:18.069 --> 09:19.269
I bet we're looking
for a 9-millimeter.

09:20.171 --> 09:23.272
I'll have ballistics confirm.
I just like to guess.

09:24.408 --> 09:25.674
And I'm usually right.

09:26.810 --> 09:30.045
Gunned down at one of the best
universities in the country.

09:30.947 --> 09:33.115
I loved every minute there.

09:34.584 --> 09:36.584
Well, maybe not
protein biochemistry.

09:40.088 --> 09:41.455
Shooter was close.

09:42.118 --> 09:43.767
I found a hair on her body.

09:45.359 --> 09:47.560
Give it to the crime lab.
See if they find DNA.

09:55.302 --> 09:57.203
Well-developed quadricep femoris.

09:57.237 --> 09:59.038
Yeah, she was a
division-I soccer player.

10:00.506 --> 10:01.981
Did you play sports?

10:01.982 --> 10:04.342
Ballet and fencing.

10:05.454 --> 10:06.605
Those aren't sports.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.228
Yes, they are.

10:08.310 --> 10:11.111
What did you play? Field hockey.
I was an attacker.

10:11.146 --> 10:12.946
I'm sure you were very aggressive.

10:14.015 --> 10:15.948
"Attacker" is a position.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
Maura...

10:34.565 --> 10:37.276
...She died from a gunshot
wound to the chest.

10:37.277 --> 10:39.782
Since when is the chest bone
connected to the ankle bone?

10:40.303 --> 10:42.778
The anterior inferior tibiofibular

10:42.779 --> 10:44.711
syndesmotic ligament is ruptured.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.135
Sounds painful.

10:46.136 --> 10:47.803
Probably hurt her to walk.

10:48.638 --> 10:50.305
It's an unusual injury.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.973
You see it in
professional athletes.

10:52.008 --> 10:55.311
Her doctors missed it.
She needed surgery.

10:55.345 --> 10:57.679
Then how was she playing
division-I soccer?

10:57.714 --> 10:59.247
Well, she wasn't.

10:59.282 --> 11:01.215
She wasn't playing soccer
on this ankle for a while.

11:02.617 --> 11:04.785
So our scholar-athlete was lying.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.788
Why?

11:37.941 --> 11:40.620
***

11:40.621 --> 11:43.883
***

11:43.884 --> 11:47.076
***

11:47.077 --> 11:49.454

11:53.985 --> 11:56.015

11:56.016 --> 11:58.520

12:22.469 --> 12:24.637
***

12:24.831 --> 12:27.050
***

12:27.051 --> 12:28.350
straight fro the bursar's office...

12:28.351 --> 12:30.352
paid it off herself in a lump sum.

12:32.755 --> 12:36.190
W... holy cr... $57,000 a year?!

12:36.224 --> 12:37.491
Includes room and board.

12:37.525 --> 12:38.926
That should include a car.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.795
That should include an
all-expense-paid trip around the world.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.974
Hell of a lot of money to wear
a toga and do jell-o shots.

12:43.975 --> 12:45.432
Right?

12:45.466 --> 12:47.767
Where'd you go to college, Korsak?

12:47.801 --> 12:48.767
Didn't.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.336
Watched "animal house" a few times.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.537
Course you did.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.175
Got something, Jane.

13:01.579 --> 13:03.279
That was a good place
to kill someone.

13:03.314 --> 13:06.581
Camera's blocked.
Our suspect knows the campus.

13:06.616 --> 13:07.916
What about the security officer?

13:07.950 --> 13:09.750
Barney fife? Clean. No record.

13:09.785 --> 13:12.019
The cellphone company came
back with Danielle's texts.

13:14.989 --> 13:18.591
All that money for school and
that's how she writes?

13:18.625 --> 13:20.758
"2gtbt"?

13:20.793 --> 13:23.361
"Too good to be true.
" It's called "texting."

13:23.395 --> 13:27.297
It's so complicated my mother
does it in a nursing home!

13:33.443 --> 13:35.878
Who's "b-bear"?

13:35.912 --> 13:37.379
There's a lot of
texts from this guy.

13:37.413 --> 13:40.115
"Miss u." "Love u, babe."

13:40.149 --> 13:41.349
"Call me."

13:43.018 --> 13:45.586
"B-bear." Brandon Lewis.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.120
Sophomore.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.623
Now, why didn't Natalie tell me

13:50.658 --> 13:52.291
that she had a boyfriend?

13:54.116 --> 13:56.120
Because they broke up a month ago.

13:56.121 --> 13:57.352
Why?

13:57.353 --> 13:59.754
He was stressing her.

13:59.789 --> 14:00.955
What do you mean?

14:02.557 --> 14:04.858
She said she didn't have
time for a boyfriend.

14:05.927 --> 14:08.862
And how did he feel about that?

14:08.896 --> 14:10.930
Brandon's a good guy...

14:12.432 --> 14:14.432
But?

14:15.668 --> 14:17.835
It was pretty sudden.

14:17.870 --> 14:19.437
He was pissed.

14:19.471 --> 14:20.705
I don't understand.

14:20.739 --> 14:23.507
She had even less time when
she was playing soccer.

14:28.245 --> 14:30.212
How did you know she
was cut from the team?

14:30.246 --> 14:31.513
How did you know?

14:36.785 --> 14:38.019
She told me.

14:41.456 --> 14:43.190
She was really sad.

14:45.359 --> 14:47.960
She said she felt
like she lost herself.

14:47.994 --> 14:49.328
Why didn't you tell me about this?

14:50.730 --> 14:52.864
She didn't want her dad to know.

14:56.702 --> 14:58.970
Was she sad about breaking
it off with Brandon?

15:01.506 --> 15:03.440
Ever since she got
hurt playing soccer,

15:03.474 --> 15:05.041
she was sad about everything.

15:14.182 --> 15:16.717
Unh-unh. Boston homicide.

15:17.552 --> 15:19.219
Brandon Lewis here?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.821
I thought this was a
frat house. It is.

15:22.855 --> 15:23.889
We're getting ready for a party.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.557
In the middle of the day?

15:25.591 --> 15:26.858
We just finished finals.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.629
Congratulations.

15:29.631 --> 15:31.531
Excuse us.

15:32.028 --> 15:33.204
Do you think their parents know

15:33.205 --> 15:36.403
they're spending $1,000 an
hour for them to dress in foil?

15:36.437 --> 15:38.755
Hi. Can you get Brandon
Lewis for us, please?

15:38.756 --> 15:40.072
Thank you.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.009
Okay, w... why are you aring this?

15:45.044 --> 15:46.077
Abc party.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.213
Anything t clothes?

15:53.817 --> 15:55.351
You Brandon?

15:55.385 --> 15:57.553
Yeah. Is this about Danielle?

15:59.488 --> 16:00.855
I'm not some gangbanger.

16:01.957 --> 16:03.357
I'm pre-law.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.393
We'll try to keep that in mind.

16:07.495 --> 16:09.396
When did you and Danielle break up?

16:10.464 --> 16:12.432
She broke up with me a month ago.

16:12.466 --> 16:14.100
Why? I don't know.

16:14.134 --> 16:15.368
Dig a little...

16:16.069 --> 16:17.903
...Pre-law.

16:17.937 --> 16:19.571
Must be teaching you
some analytical skills.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.739
I said, "I don't know."

16:23.408 --> 16:24.809
Was she seeing someone else?

16:24.843 --> 16:25.609
No.

16:26.845 --> 16:29.279
Why? Do you know something?

16:29.313 --> 16:31.581
Come on, Brandon.

16:32.098 --> 16:34.316
A girl that looked like Danielle...

16:34.351 --> 16:36.451
they're not alone very long.

16:40.322 --> 16:42.118
How would you feel if she
was seeing someone else?

16:42.119 --> 16:43.309
Really happy. What do you think?

16:43.310 --> 16:44.987
I think a man gets enraged

16:44.988 --> 16:47.022
and he does things that he regrets.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.459
I-I'm not some homicidal maniac!

16:50.493 --> 16:52.227
I-I loved her.
Why would I kill her?

16:52.261 --> 16:53.795
I don't know, Brandon.
Why would you?

16:54.409 --> 16:56.330
You can't pin this on me.

16:57.432 --> 16:58.865
I want a lawyer.

17:00.701 --> 17:02.368
Took him long enough.

17:11.243 --> 17:13.944
Is this from the good fridge
or the dead-people fridge?

17:13.979 --> 17:16.012
Cold air is cold air.

17:17.816 --> 17:18.848
How old is it?

17:18.883 --> 17:21.451
No, don't tell me.
I-I'm too hungry.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.088
Mm.

17:25.122 --> 17:26.155
Mm.

17:30.193 --> 17:32.193
I was at BCU.

17:32.228 --> 17:35.396
The sorority girls
were dressed in foil.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.097
The abc party.

17:37.131 --> 17:40.366
Such a rho zeta theta thing.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.302
You take it for granted
that you know all that.

17:43.337 --> 17:45.738
Well, I didn't know
"attacker" was a position.

17:45.772 --> 17:47.839
A gaping hole in your education.

17:50.576 --> 17:52.209
I try not to have regrets...

17:53.345 --> 17:54.611
But, I don't know.

17:54.646 --> 17:56.980
W-when I was on that campus, I...

17:57.508 --> 17:59.582
I felt like I missed out.

18:00.651 --> 18:03.319
Jane, you're a bright,
accomplished woman.

18:03.353 --> 18:04.687
I peeked in the library.

18:05.522 --> 18:08.756
All the things I could have
known if I'd gone to college.

18:10.759 --> 18:12.527
Something about being there was...

18:12.561 --> 18:14.095
It was inspiring, you know?

18:17.532 --> 18:20.066
But you know more about human
beings than anyone I know.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.611
Bad human beings.

18:21.612 --> 18:23.802
We're all a mix of good and bad.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.576
Hey, ma. What is it now?

18:35.046 --> 18:36.814
Oof.

18:39.351 --> 18:40.684
What is this?

18:42.187 --> 18:45.923
Well, your father wouldn't help me,
so I traded in my car.

18:47.978 --> 18:49.760
Were you semiconscious at the time?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.195
Don't be condescending.

18:51.229 --> 18:52.716
Oh, wow.

18:52.717 --> 18:56.600
It's a 429-cubic-inch, uh, v-8.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.469
It's a very efficient
engine for its time.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.671
40 years ago.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.508
I-I-is this about
teaching pop some lesson?

19:03.542 --> 19:06.777
Well, that... may
have been part of it.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.648
Smoke, uh, is leaking

19:10.682 --> 19:13.511
from your valve-cover gasket,

19:13.512 --> 19:15.217
but I-I could replace that for you.

19:15.218 --> 19:17.220
But I-I do see some other problems.

19:17.254 --> 19:19.490
You're burning oil.

19:19.524 --> 19:22.792
I would suspect it's a ring job.

19:22.827 --> 19:23.793
How much?

19:25.530 --> 19:28.064
Uh, three, maybe four.

19:28.098 --> 19:28.831
Hundred?

19:28.866 --> 19:30.166
Thousand.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.266
Oh!

19:32.034 --> 19:34.502
Oh, God. Your father
is gonna kill me.

19:34.536 --> 19:36.270
Tell him not to do
it while I'm on call.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.475
Can you help me get the buick back?

19:41.009 --> 19:43.311
They're crooks,
and you're a police officer!

19:43.345 --> 19:44.679
I'm a homicide detective!

19:44.713 --> 19:47.148
Ma, wh... are you planning
on killing the car dealer?!

19:47.182 --> 19:48.149
I might.

19:49.418 --> 19:51.385
Is it driveable?

19:51.419 --> 19:53.487
Maybe a few miles.

19:53.522 --> 19:55.723
Fine. Let's call you a cab.
Frost: Hey, hey.

19:55.757 --> 19:56.946
Ran down that barcode key

19:56.947 --> 19:59.259
we found in Danielle's dorm room.

19:59.294 --> 20:00.494
You found something.

20:00.528 --> 20:03.529
It opens a locker at a
high-end gym in somerville.

20:07.633 --> 20:11.503
Danielle stored a nice dress...

20:11.537 --> 20:13.071
And, uh...

20:14.306 --> 20:18.108
...Some "do-me"
heels in a secret locker.

20:19.543 --> 20:21.477
That was not her only secret.

20:22.813 --> 20:27.482
I think I know how our innocent
sophomore made $57,000.

20:33.279 --> 20:34.769
***

20:34.770 --> 20:36.367
and when tuition was due,
I'm figuring

20:36.368 --> 20:39.585
that Danielle was turning
tricks for no more than a month.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.923
How'd she put that kind of
money together in a month?

20:41.958 --> 20:44.195
Well, I mean, she'd have to have
some pretty high-end clients.

20:44.229 --> 20:45.997
Ugh.

20:46.032 --> 20:48.269
Come on. We're taking this.

20:48.304 --> 20:51.213
A little undercover
field trip to an expert.

20:51.247 --> 20:52.648
A pimp?

20:52.682 --> 20:54.305
Yeah, well, she had to
be working with someone

20:54.306 --> 20:56.284
to make that kind of cash, right?

20:56.318 --> 20:57.351
Can I drive?

21:00.150 --> 21:02.515
Yeah, knock yourself out.

21:21.631 --> 21:24.832
Maybe Danielle had, like,
a very rich sugar daddy.

21:25.402 --> 21:28.402
Maybe b-bear found out why
she didn't have time for him

21:28.436 --> 21:29.503
and killed her.

21:29.537 --> 21:31.338
Mm, mm, mm!

21:31.372 --> 21:34.540
I need me a little taste of
this vanilla bitch right here.

21:34.574 --> 21:37.576
How much for a party?

21:37.610 --> 21:39.577
Three to five years.

21:39.612 --> 21:40.945
Oh, my bad.

21:40.980 --> 21:43.214
But 5-0 looking fine!

21:43.249 --> 21:44.349
Get out of here. Uh-huh.

21:46.385 --> 21:49.585
Leave it to my mother to trade
her buick in for a pimpmobile.

21:52.722 --> 21:54.757
Okay, there's my expert.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.592
He was a really good source
when I worked this sector.

21:56.626 --> 21:57.726
Maybe he can tell us

21:57.760 --> 21:59.580
how Danielle was hooking
up with her Johns.

21:59.581 --> 22:00.715
Hey, man.

22:00.716 --> 22:02.050
Oh, it's Rizzoli.

22:02.566 --> 22:03.831
Who died?

22:03.865 --> 22:06.266
Detective Frost, this is Mo Monee.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.601
Your, uh,

22:07.635 --> 22:09.569
your ride needs work.

22:09.603 --> 22:10.837
It's my mother's.

22:10.871 --> 22:14.205
Oh, damn. Mama's got some gangsta.

22:15.307 --> 22:16.674
She one of yours?

22:16.708 --> 22:19.910
I wish. Girl like that could earn.

22:20.978 --> 22:22.011
Maybe she had a pimp.

22:22.046 --> 22:23.513
Maybe you could find out for us.

22:25.115 --> 22:26.808
She was a college student.

22:26.809 --> 22:28.316
Man, it ain't like it used to be.

22:29.452 --> 22:32.398
Bitches be trippin' now,
gettin' their own websites.

22:32.399 --> 22:34.782
All kinds of amateurs
up in this game.

22:34.783 --> 22:36.177
Maybe she was solo.

22:36.178 --> 22:39.358
No, if she was working regular,
she had herself a daddy.

22:39.392 --> 22:40.625
And a book.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.860
You check her book?

22:43.729 --> 22:44.762
We didn't find one.

22:45.393 --> 22:47.063
She had a book.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.666
I mean, this whole damn
world's gone crazy,

22:49.700 --> 22:52.001
but hoes still need
to keep schedule.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.211
Hello.

23:05.246 --> 23:06.746
You've got a great eye.

23:06.781 --> 23:08.615
This one's in tip-top...

23:11.653 --> 23:12.919
okay, what's this about?

23:14.439 --> 23:16.388
That is your car.

23:16.423 --> 23:18.891
This is my mother's car.

23:22.008 --> 23:23.608
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't do that.

23:23.609 --> 23:25.318
That lemon that you sold her

23:25.319 --> 23:26.598
needs thousands of dollars of work.

23:26.599 --> 23:29.700
According to the law,
we're not responsible

23:29.734 --> 23:31.768
for abuse, negligence, or accident

23:31.802 --> 23:34.203
once the car leaves our lot.

23:34.238 --> 23:37.106
Right, the law.

23:37.141 --> 23:38.708
Hmm.

23:38.742 --> 23:41.644
How about you showing me
all your 140-58 documents

23:41.678 --> 23:44.580
that shows that you have the
bonds for all these cars?

23:44.615 --> 23:46.720
Also, let's get out your titles

23:46.721 --> 23:48.027
so we can verify the vin numbers.

23:48.028 --> 23:50.117
What do you say, uh, Roger?

23:53.756 --> 23:56.923
We want all our customers to
have a satisfactory experience.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.157
I'm sure we could rescind the sale.

23:59.192 --> 24:01.292
Throw in a new alternator,
all right?

24:01.327 --> 24:03.628
I don't think that
will be a problem.

24:03.662 --> 24:05.096
And floor mats.

24:07.163 --> 24:08.771
It'll be our pleasure.

24:14.639 --> 24:18.041
I didn't think that you talked
like that to anybody but me.

24:19.110 --> 24:21.411
Is that mom-speak for "thank you"?

24:35.322 --> 24:37.489
Uh... oh.

24:37.523 --> 24:41.660
Dr. Maura Isles,
knuckle-deep in germy bar snacks?

24:41.661 --> 24:42.490
I'm shocked.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.424
Oh, I had representative
samples tested.

24:45.458 --> 24:47.825
Bacteria count fell
within acceptable limits.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.927
You want one?

24:49.961 --> 24:51.995
It must be very
complicated to be you.

24:52.029 --> 24:53.329
You have no idea.

24:54.864 --> 24:56.733
I had to get out of the office.

25:00.143 --> 25:01.644
Me too.

25:01.679 --> 25:04.180
I feel guilty taking a break.
We don't have a solid lead.

25:04.214 --> 25:05.514
We might.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.238
I got the lab results back

25:07.239 --> 25:08.684
from that hair sample
I found on Danielle.

25:09.886 --> 25:12.688
It's synthetic. From a toupee.

25:12.722 --> 25:15.157
Danielle was selling herself
to a guy with a plastic rug?

25:15.191 --> 25:16.425
Ugh!

25:16.459 --> 25:18.993
Maybe he took it off,
you know, during.

25:19.028 --> 25:20.795
God, a child at the
college of her dreams,

25:20.829 --> 25:21.996
and she's turning tricks.

25:22.030 --> 25:24.131
To stay. You know,
she lost her scholarship.

25:24.165 --> 25:25.832
She was trying to pay for school.

25:25.867 --> 25:29.335
How about a loan? Hell,
some people even flip burgers.

25:29.369 --> 25:31.704
Not possible. Why?

25:31.738 --> 25:35.273
Because there are only
8,760 hours in a year,

25:35.308 --> 25:38.076
and to pay for school,
she needed to work 9,500 hours.

25:38.648 --> 25:39.849
You're defending her.

25:39.850 --> 25:43.013
Your fancy French boarding
school warped your young mind.

25:43.047 --> 25:46.015
In Europe, women make all kinds
of arrangements with men.

25:46.050 --> 25:47.917
And both parties
get what they need.

25:47.951 --> 25:51.086
No shame, no pimps, no victims.

25:52.321 --> 25:55.055
I'm sure it was terrible for
Danielle to resort to that.

25:55.090 --> 25:56.123
She had other choices.

25:56.157 --> 25:57.591
Apparently she didn't think so.

25:57.625 --> 25:59.626
She couldn't go to her father.

26:02.463 --> 26:03.596
Jane, what is it?

26:03.630 --> 26:04.730
You're right.

26:04.765 --> 26:07.399
H-her father was very
upset that he couldn't

26:07.434 --> 26:10.535
keep her in that school
without that scholarship.

26:18.479 --> 26:19.918
You know that piece of plastic

26:19.919 --> 26:21.485
you found at the crime scene?

26:22.287 --> 26:24.721
It's acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene.

26:27.191 --> 26:28.724
From a computer.

26:30.610 --> 26:32.882
Danielle's missing laptop.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.013
I bet the person who
stole it dropped it.

26:36.757 --> 26:40.992
And I bet the campus computer
store can tell us who that is.

26:41.027 --> 26:43.294
Wait, what are you gonna do?

26:43.329 --> 26:45.796
Sit outside and
wait for it to open?

26:45.831 --> 26:48.198
Yeah, I might. I'll see you later.

26:54.037 --> 26:56.706
Anybody bring in a
laptop for repairs

26:56.740 --> 26:59.107
within the past 24 hours? Uh, yeah.

26:59.141 --> 27:00.775
Can I see the repair slips, please?

27:06.682 --> 27:07.782
That's this morning's.

27:09.317 --> 27:10.850
You need yesterday's, too?

27:10.885 --> 27:13.753
Yes, please.

27:20.191 --> 27:21.458
Hey, officer Kelly.

27:29.999 --> 27:31.700
Get him! Get him! Get him!

27:31.734 --> 27:33.802
Don't run from the cops!

27:33.836 --> 27:36.037
Oh, look at this.

27:37.339 --> 27:39.139
Laptop-repair slip.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.321
You want to bet it's Danielle's?

27:50.146 --> 27:52.180
I didn't kill her.

27:52.214 --> 27:54.348
You had her laptop.

27:54.382 --> 27:55.700
I found it. After you killed her.

27:55.701 --> 27:57.378
She was dead when I got there.

27:57.379 --> 27:59.814
I grabbed it,
put it in the cruiser,

27:59.848 --> 28:01.526
and then I went to call it in.

28:04.389 --> 28:07.756
So your only crime is
stealing from the dead girl?

28:08.919 --> 28:09.886
Look...

28:09.920 --> 28:12.121
It stinks that she's dead.

28:12.155 --> 28:14.222
But she's not gonna
miss the laptop, right?

28:22.397 --> 28:24.231
You're gonna miss your bed.

28:25.299 --> 28:26.699
Take him to lockup.

28:35.774 --> 28:38.607
Cheez doodles or chewy bears?

28:38.642 --> 28:40.741
So hard to choose.

28:40.776 --> 28:43.877
You better have the
protein bar, detective.

28:44.489 --> 28:45.517
Thanks a lot.

28:45.518 --> 28:46.780
You told me to remind you.

28:48.349 --> 28:51.250
I think I found
Danielle's hooker book.

28:51.285 --> 28:53.285
It's on her laptop.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.488
That's her calendar.
See all these entries?

28:56.522 --> 28:59.991
I think they're code for
Johns she was meeting.

29:00.025 --> 29:03.127
Uh, that looks like a college
student making notes to herself.

29:03.161 --> 29:05.428
Except she wasn't
taking art history.

29:06.497 --> 29:08.598
I don't know. M-maybe he's right.

29:08.632 --> 29:11.543
Look, she, uh,
she records historical dates,

29:11.544 --> 29:14.569
but always as "1700," "1800."

29:14.604 --> 29:16.738
That's... that's military time.

29:16.772 --> 29:18.072
Look at this one... "2100."

29:18.107 --> 29:20.226
She was probably taking
"future U.S. history,"

29:20.227 --> 29:22.009
right, Korsak?

29:22.043 --> 29:25.245
Her texts to Brandon
stopped about a month ago.

29:25.279 --> 29:28.581
That's... that's right
when these entries begin.

29:29.683 --> 29:30.783
Look at this.

29:31.952 --> 29:33.452
The night before she died...

29:33.486 --> 29:36.821
"windgate act passed
by a.H., 2100."

29:36.856 --> 29:38.890
Yeah, there's a
windgate hotel downtown.

29:38.924 --> 29:40.621
Maybe a.H. Stayed there.

29:40.622 --> 29:42.159
Wild-goose chase, you ask me.

29:42.193 --> 29:44.427
No one's asking you. I'll go, Jane.

29:44.462 --> 29:45.462
Okay.

29:50.146 --> 29:52.177
Hotel-security footage.

29:52.178 --> 29:54.780
That him? The bad rug?

29:56.082 --> 29:58.216
Wild-goose chase, huh, Korsak?

29:58.250 --> 30:00.190
Didn't find anything.

30:00.191 --> 30:01.241
Oh, except...

30:01.953 --> 30:03.987
...One of Danielle's Johns.

30:04.021 --> 30:05.388
But we're probably not interested

30:05.423 --> 30:07.356
in the guy she was with
the day she was murdered.

30:07.391 --> 30:08.831
All right, you've had your fun.

30:08.832 --> 30:11.626
I was wrong, okay? So, sue me.

30:11.660 --> 30:14.895
"A.H." Is professor
Andrew hilliard?

30:14.929 --> 30:17.632
Hilliard sold his house
in Cambridge last month.

30:17.666 --> 30:19.600
Been renting cheap,
school-owned housing

30:19.634 --> 30:20.767
for the past few months.

30:20.802 --> 30:22.068
Sold his house?

30:22.847 --> 30:25.737
You think Danielle was shaking
him down for tuition money?

30:33.546 --> 30:37.047
Like she's trying to wipe
away what she'd become.

30:37.081 --> 30:40.783
Tell Rizzoli. She'll be
delighted to get this creep.

30:42.552 --> 30:44.486
Professor hilliard.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.521
Boston P.D. We're coming in.

30:47.423 --> 30:48.389
Oh!

30:49.759 --> 30:51.159
We got a deco.

30:51.193 --> 30:52.360
Smells a lot like day two.

30:55.196 --> 30:56.897
You gonna hurl again?

30:56.931 --> 30:59.232
You want me to kiss
him on the lips?

31:00.802 --> 31:02.035
Glock 26.

31:02.070 --> 31:04.471
It's the same gun
that got Danielle.

31:06.107 --> 31:08.708
Serial numbers are filed.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.743
Why did he kill Danielle? Jealousy?

31:10.777 --> 31:12.144
Maybe.

31:12.178 --> 31:15.213
Then he kills himself 'cause
he can't live with what he did.

31:15.247 --> 31:16.414
Except...

31:17.548 --> 31:18.682
Except?

31:18.716 --> 31:20.450
Except it's a setup.

31:22.519 --> 31:24.486
Hardly any blood on his gun hand.

31:24.521 --> 31:26.523
Yeah, there's none
on the slide either.

31:28.559 --> 31:30.360
This isn't a suicide.

31:38.034 --> 31:39.100
Hey.

31:39.710 --> 31:41.877
Hi. I'm going to the crime lab.

31:41.878 --> 31:43.019
I'll ride with you.

31:43.020 --> 31:44.472
Maura measured the entrance
and the exit wounds.

31:44.507 --> 31:46.081
Hilliard didn't kill himself.

31:46.082 --> 31:47.707
He was shot by somebody
right next to him.

31:47.741 --> 31:48.707
Huh.

31:48.741 --> 31:49.908
His broker confirmed

31:49.942 --> 31:52.476
hilliard's been withdrawing
$15,000 a month.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.246
That's $180,000... for what?

31:55.280 --> 31:56.847
No idea.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.016
But it's been going on
for a year and a half.

32:00.151 --> 32:03.186
So, the professor starts
seeing student prostitutes...

32:03.220 --> 32:04.755
...And somebody starts
blackmailing him.

32:06.457 --> 32:08.258
Huh.

32:08.292 --> 32:10.567
Yeah, but I-it couldn't
have been Danielle.

32:10.568 --> 32:13.028
She'd been a scholarship soccer
player up until the last month.

32:16.699 --> 32:18.132
Striations match.

32:18.167 --> 32:20.501
Same gun killed
Danielle and hilliard.

32:20.894 --> 32:24.104
Tracing this gun is our best
hope of finding the shooter.

32:24.138 --> 32:25.304
How?

32:26.340 --> 32:27.606
Serial numbers were filed off.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.474
Just because your bright,
shiny objects can't do it

32:29.509 --> 32:30.908
doesn't mean it can't be done.

32:31.810 --> 32:33.310
Hey, Maura.

32:33.345 --> 32:34.644
Let's get to the university.

32:34.679 --> 32:36.748
Danielle's friends are throwing
her a candlelight vigil.

32:36.782 --> 32:38.283
I want to get there early,
all right?

32:38.318 --> 32:40.186
Oh, I'd like to come with you,
pay my respects,

32:40.221 --> 32:42.321
maybe help you look
for the bad guy.

32:42.356 --> 32:44.790
They like to see the
results of their work.

32:44.825 --> 32:47.760
I know because I had two
years of forensic psychiatry.

32:47.794 --> 32:49.257
It took you two years

32:49.258 --> 32:51.796
to figure out that bad
guys were screwed up?

33:14.352 --> 33:16.319
I think that's her dad there.

33:16.354 --> 33:18.121
It's beautiful...

33:18.156 --> 33:19.590
In a sad way.

33:19.624 --> 33:22.059
Just keep looking at faces.

33:28.099 --> 33:29.767
Hello, detective.

33:31.436 --> 33:33.203
Some turnout, huh?

33:35.540 --> 33:38.675
Yeah, it's a tribute to the kind
of person your daughter was.

33:42.046 --> 33:45.711
We are doing our best. I promise.

33:46.879 --> 33:48.045
Thanks.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.846
Excuse me.

33:57.507 --> 33:58.748
You got something?

33:58.749 --> 34:00.950
Yeah. The numbers off the gun.

34:00.984 --> 34:04.352
It's registered to Scott Bilton,
wilkes-barre, Pennsylvania.

34:06.907 --> 34:09.090
Bilton? Lucas, the r.A., bilton?

34:09.123 --> 34:10.524
His stepfather.

34:12.060 --> 34:14.761
Be careful. He's got three
other guns registered.

34:14.795 --> 34:15.996
Okay. Thanks.

34:37.764 --> 34:41.420
Murder weapon's traced to the r.A.

34:41.449 --> 34:43.318
That kid's the killer?

34:44.553 --> 34:47.425
Of course... r.A.
S keep tabs on their floors.

34:47.426 --> 34:49.556
And he would know that
she lost her scholarship,

34:49.558 --> 34:50.855
that she was desperate.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.587
Looks like his part-time
job was pimping.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.160
Let's wait till this thing is over.

34:57.161 --> 34:58.382
We'll get him when
he's alone, okay?

34:58.383 --> 35:01.062
Maura, stay here. Okay.

35:13.206 --> 35:15.073
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:15.107 --> 35:17.641
Look at the bracelet.
It's the same as Danielle's.

35:18.743 --> 35:20.911
Natalie was hooking, too.

35:22.947 --> 35:24.848
I loved Danielle.

35:26.083 --> 35:29.186
Anything I can say about
this remarkable person

35:29.220 --> 35:32.188
won't come close to
describing who she was.

35:34.958 --> 35:35.791
Gun!

35:37.794 --> 35:38.794
Drop it!

35:38.829 --> 35:40.496
You killed Danielle!

35:41.464 --> 35:43.664
She couldn't keep her mouth shut.

35:44.632 --> 35:47.066
Don't think I won't kill you,
too. Please.

35:54.172 --> 35:56.140
Jane, go! I got her!

36:07.084 --> 36:08.384
Lucas!

36:08.418 --> 36:10.719
She was a whore,
and she was a whiner!

36:11.955 --> 36:14.890
I gave her 57 grand, and she
didn't want to do it anymore?!

36:14.924 --> 36:16.124
You work it off, bitch!

36:16.159 --> 36:18.293
Just put the gun down!
We can talk about this!

36:19.995 --> 36:22.763
Or I'll just blow your head off.

36:22.797 --> 36:24.231
He's running!

36:32.973 --> 36:33.940
Frost.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.207
I'm with you.

37:29.119 --> 37:31.453
Woman on p.A.: Dr.
Davis, telephone please.

37:31.487 --> 37:32.887
Dr. Davis, telephone please.

37:32.922 --> 37:35.089
Well...Good to see you
with your eyes open.

37:35.123 --> 37:37.491
It's good to be going home.

37:40.061 --> 37:41.302
How you feeling?

37:41.303 --> 37:43.530
Eh, my ribs are a little sore.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.132
Bullet was a "through and through."

37:45.166 --> 37:46.433
Dr. Blair...

37:46.468 --> 37:48.035
It's better than
most case scenarios.

37:48.069 --> 37:49.202
I know.

37:49.237 --> 37:51.271
Bullet broke two ribs,
came right back out.

37:52.439 --> 37:54.807
I guess I passed out from shock.

37:54.842 --> 37:56.442
It just hurts to laugh or cough.

37:56.477 --> 37:57.878
Well, at least you'll
have a cool scar.

37:57.912 --> 38:00.048
Doctor said just two pucker marks.

38:00.082 --> 38:02.817
Oh, good. So then you can
continue to wear foil bikinis.

38:03.886 --> 38:05.086
Oh.

38:05.921 --> 38:07.455
Don't make me laugh.

38:07.490 --> 38:09.724
Sorry.

38:09.758 --> 38:11.058
Here. These are for you.

38:11.093 --> 38:13.427
Thanks. You're welcome.

38:13.462 --> 38:15.095
Let's get you out of here.

38:15.130 --> 38:17.932
Dr. Davis, telephone please.

38:17.966 --> 38:20.201
Dr. Davis, telephone please.

38:20.235 --> 38:21.936
Are you gonna tell my parents?

38:21.970 --> 38:23.404
That you got shot?

38:24.973 --> 38:26.808
Well, I think they already know.

38:31.283 --> 38:32.549
Thank you.

38:36.518 --> 38:39.186
I was really desperate, and...

38:39.220 --> 38:41.989
And it was really stupid.

38:42.023 --> 38:45.626
Well, everybody does stupid things.

38:45.660 --> 38:47.127
That stupid?

38:49.531 --> 38:51.367
Okay, no. Maybe not that stupid.

38:51.401 --> 38:53.769
But you're here.

38:55.072 --> 38:57.073
And you get a second chance.

38:58.142 --> 39:00.209
When do you go back to school?

39:00.244 --> 39:01.644
I don't.

39:02.846 --> 39:03.846
I can't pay.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.616
And I can't do what I was doing....

39:07.684 --> 39:09.018
...Ever.

39:11.421 --> 39:13.055
Oh. Here.

39:13.090 --> 39:14.924
What's this? Open it.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.501
Weird, huh?

39:26.535 --> 39:28.336
I talked to the bursar's office.

39:28.370 --> 39:31.405
They said you were paid all the
way up to your senior year.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.340
How... but...

39:33.375 --> 39:34.233
there's always a little

39:34.234 --> 39:36.590
leftover scholarship
money for hardship cases.

39:36.591 --> 39:39.479
I argued that your case
was a major hardship.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.651
Thank you.

39:43.686 --> 39:45.554
You study hard, okay? Yeah.

39:51.561 --> 39:54.029
See you soon. Take care.

40:10.413 --> 40:12.881
So, what was it like
working on a live victim?

40:15.756 --> 40:17.171
Terrifying.

40:19.055 --> 40:22.191
And exhilarating.

40:22.690 --> 40:24.725
Natalie confirmed
your theory though.

40:24.759 --> 40:27.829
Lucas had about a half-dozen
girls working off tuition.

40:27.863 --> 40:29.764
Yeah. Lucas was the company store.

40:29.798 --> 40:31.532
Fronted the money to Danielle.

40:31.567 --> 40:34.202
Maybe she found out that he was
blackmailing the professor,

40:34.236 --> 40:35.570
and he killed her.

40:35.604 --> 40:37.823
Yeah. She probably
thought she could get out

40:37.824 --> 40:39.407
if she threatened to go public.

40:40.609 --> 40:42.744
That poor father.
What he must be going through.

40:46.147 --> 40:47.548
I applied to BCU.

40:51.486 --> 40:52.662
It's very hard to get into.

40:52.663 --> 40:54.062
I got in.

40:57.293 --> 40:58.293
Why didn't you go?

40:58.877 --> 41:00.796
Wanted to be a cop.

41:03.079 --> 41:05.167
What's the real reason?

41:06.304 --> 41:08.171
My father would have sold
everything to send me there.

41:08.205 --> 41:09.505
I couldn't do that to him.

41:11.508 --> 41:13.442
Did you ever tell him?

41:13.476 --> 41:16.011
Nope. That would make him too sad.

41:20.082 --> 41:22.416
Well, I wonder what's
gonna happen to Natalie.

41:22.451 --> 41:24.151
She's going back to school.

41:24.186 --> 41:26.086
What?

41:26.121 --> 41:28.989
Made a little deal
with the Chancellor.

41:29.023 --> 41:31.057
We keep a lid on it,
they go back to school.

41:31.092 --> 41:33.035
On the university's expense.

41:33.036 --> 41:35.178
Mm-hmm, 'cause, you know,
if this got out,

41:35.179 --> 41:36.829
people might be judgmental.

41:41.801 --> 41:44.602
What are you gonna
tell Danielle's father?

41:47.706 --> 41:49.340
All he needs to know

41:49.374 --> 41:50.974
is that his daughter
loved him very much.

41:53.077 --> 41:54.944
Aww, Jane.

41:54.978 --> 41:56.011
What?

41:56.046 --> 41:58.247
I think that's really...

41:58.281 --> 41:59.581
That's really sweet.

41:59.616 --> 42:02.050
Oh, gross. Okay. Gimme the wine.

42:02.084 --> 42:03.051
What? Really! Mnh. Okay.

42:03.251 --> 42:13.451
