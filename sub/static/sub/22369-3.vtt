10:23.789 --> 10:25.249
Are you even you?

10:25.333 --> 10:29.253
What? No, it's me! It's me,
Uncle Jim. Look, it's me!

10:29.337 --> 10:30.838
That's what she'd say.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.883
That's also what I would
say! It's me, Uncle Jim.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.593
Let's measure.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.182
[exhales] Thirty-two. Phew! It is her.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.642
- Obviously!
- [Patrick sighs]

10:42.725 --> 10:44.268
God, look what she's doing to us!

10:44.352 --> 10:47.396
Just calm down, okay? I have a plan.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.940
While spying on these
bullies from the chat room,

10:50.024 --> 10:53.402
I heard them talking about our target
performing in a talent show today,

10:53.486 --> 10:55.946
which is our best bet
to catch our impostor.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.407
I've narrowed it down to seven
schools having talent shows.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.700
And it gets better.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.828
On closer inspection, we find
a pencil from the dentist.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.289
She goes to the dentist?
[scoffs] What a loser.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.124
[laughs] I know.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.462
Now, she's not old enough to
drive, so she must have walked.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.799
Fact. The average person
can only walk 15 minutes.

11:14.882 --> 11:20.388
All we need to do is find all the
schools within 15 minutes of dentists.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.307
Looks like Ava goes to
Cedar Falls Middle School.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.562
[stutters] Uh, yes! I knew that.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.440
Uh, which one of my clues led you there?

11:31.524 --> 11:35.236
I already know. I'm just curious.
Maybe you can enlighten everyone else.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.447
Oh, this one here where she's
wearing a T-shirt that says,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.074
"Proud student of Cedar Falls..."

11:40.157 --> 11:41.659
Cedar Falls Middle School. Yes.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.120
- Uncle Jim, you're a genius.
- Thank you.

11:44.203 --> 11:49.458
All we need to do is find the impostor,
figure out what she knows about Broadway

11:49.542 --> 11:53.838
and then expose her as a fake on
stage in front of the entire school.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.924
She thinks she can go to Broadway
and become a legend in my place,

11:57.007 --> 11:58.843
she's got another thing coming.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.803
[laughing] I love it.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.971
Let's go. Perfect.

12:02.596 --> 12:07.435
Oh, but I think that Miss Bethany
took the van to the doctor?

12:07.518 --> 12:08.477
[scoffs] That figures.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.689
We're in the middle of a crisis
and Bethany goes to the doctor?

12:11.772 --> 12:12.773
She's such a brat!

12:12.857 --> 12:15.192
Patrick, you're pedaling us to the van.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.863
You all want to get on my bicycle again?

12:18.946 --> 12:21.866
Yep, we're going. It's
only seven miles. Let's go!

12:26.495 --> 12:27.788
[sighs]

12:27.872 --> 12:30.207
[Bethany] She's worried about
me, and it's really very sweet.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.668
But it's also a little overwhelming.

12:32.751 --> 12:37.298
So, I think you need to let her
know, from a medical standpoint,

12:37.381 --> 12:41.093
that it's stressing me out, and
it's doing more harm than good.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.012
Actually, you're doing quite well.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.931
Your blood work hasn't changed.
Your numbers are stable.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.559
What? No. You need to look
at your clipboard again,

12:48.642 --> 12:51.812
because I think you'll find
she's making me very sick.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.274
Whatever Emily's doing
seems to be working.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.360
She's making me eat seeds.

12:59.028 --> 13:03.449
I mean, what if one grows
inside me and it comes out?

13:03.532 --> 13:05.701
I saw Alien. Did you see Alien?

13:05.784 --> 13:07.495
Bethany, it's not so unusual

13:07.578 --> 13:10.498
that a child would like to
mother a parent in a time of need.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.834
You should listen to your
daughter. Let her take care of you.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.086
Relax, avoid
stressful situations...

13:16.170 --> 13:19.507
Enough socializing, Bethany. I
need the van to expose a child.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.424
Oh, dear.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.718
- We're in the middle of an appointment.
- No, it's done.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.429
- Mom, give me the keys. Come on.
- Oh, okay. Okay.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.722
How are we supposed to get home?

13:26.805 --> 13:29.308
Oh, don't act like you're
stranded. You guys can hitchhike.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.228
- No one is hitchhiking.
- [Patrick] I'm sorry to interrupt,

13:32.311 --> 13:33.896
but we gotta get going if
we wanna make it on time.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.648
Raise your hand if you're hitchhiking.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.484
- You're not hitchhiking. No.
- What?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.444
I'm confused. Are you
hitchhiking or not, Mom?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.279
- Yes. No?
- No.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.739
- She's not hitchhiking?
- No, she's not.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.825
Okay, come... We need to go.
Are you hitchhiking or staying?

13:46.909 --> 13:49.078
No, I'm not hitchhiking.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.038
Thank you. Then we gotta
go. Come on, Emily, out.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.164
- Out, out, out.
- Sorry. Thank you.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.208
[Miranda] Thanks for
wasting our time, sir.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.251
[door closes]

14:02.174 --> 14:04.843
All right. This is the
little girl we're looking for.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.346
Her name's Fern and she's
a 12-year-old impostitute.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.639
Keep an eye out for her.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.809
"Impostor." "Impostitution"
is the adverb.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.143
I think it's a noun.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
That's what I said.
She's an impostitute.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.232
Well, do you know her? I mean,
why is she dressed like you?

14:18.315 --> 14:20.150
Because she's pretending to be me.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.318
Why would she do that?

14:21.402 --> 14:23.863
Because I'm famous now!
Where have you been, Mom?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.531
All right. I got the duct tape and rope.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.867
Let's go expose a little girl.

14:30.327 --> 14:34.498
No. Um, let's just stay
and listen to music. Yeah?

14:37.334 --> 14:40.296
Looks good. Perfect.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.595
[Miranda through speakers]
Feeling stressed, Uncle Jim?

14:47.678 --> 14:50.973
Just imagine you're next to a waterfall.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.308
[makes gurgling noises]

14:52.391 --> 14:54.018
Do you hear the water?

14:54.101 --> 14:55.561
[gurgling continues]

14:55.644 --> 14:58.022
How relaxing.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.565
Now, breathe in.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.774
[inhales deeply]

15:00.858 --> 15:03.611
Breathe out real hard.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.195
[exhales heavily]

15:08.741 --> 15:11.118
[whispering] Here she comes. I'll
be right back. Wait right there.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.286
[whispers] Okay.

15:12.369 --> 15:16.457
[Jim] Hello, young lady. Congratulations.
You've just won Student of the Month.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.126
The plaque ceremony is
right here in this bathroom.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.502
- [Fern] Huh?
- [Jim] Yes...

15:20.920 --> 15:23.005
A-ha! We got you, copycat.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.090
Oh, my gosh! You're Miranda Sings!

15:25.174 --> 15:28.636
I'm about to perform as you
in my talent show. Wanna come?

15:28.719 --> 15:31.430
Ha! You're not gonna perform
anywhere, little girl.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.557
- Tie her up.
- Give me that.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.185
Would you prefer a
bowline or a square knot?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.394
Patrick, just tie her up!

15:37.478 --> 15:39.229
A tiller's hitch won't
cut off circulation.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.524
Why are you tying me up? Is this
for a video? That's hilarious.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.194
Okay, I'll be asking the questions here.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.697
Have you heard from Broadway? Did
they contact you? What do you know?

15:48.781 --> 15:51.283
- What?
- Answer the question.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.411
Is this a game? I don't get it.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.122
Quit changing the subject.
What has Broadway said to you?

15:57.206 --> 15:58.040
Nothing.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.291
[groans]

15:59.375 --> 16:02.044
She's a tough cookie. I don't
think we're gonna crack her.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.047
Fine, we'll have to go
to part two of our plan.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.675
Get ready to get exposed, little girl.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.930
You're gonna love part two.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.607
- She's not very good.
- No, she's not. She's not you.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.569
- Why are her shoes so loud?
- Well, those are tap shoes.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.697
- What?
- They're for tap dancing.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.449
- What's tap dancing?
- It's what she's trying to do right now.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.576
- Oh, I thought that was ballet.
- No, no.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.500
- You're almost up.
- [audience applauding]

16:41.583 --> 16:42.918
I'm sure you're gonna do great.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.920
[clears throat] I know last
time you were on a stage,

16:45.004 --> 16:49.550
you got laughed at and humiliated,
and your whole family left you.

16:49.633 --> 16:53.846
But I'm sure this time... I'm
sure you'll be fine. [Chuckles]

16:53.929 --> 16:55.681
[breathes heavily]

16:55.764 --> 16:57.057
I have to poop.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.355
Mmm-hmm. [Clears throat]

17:04.647 --> 17:05.648
What?

17:07.000 --> 17:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:16.201 --> 17:17.411
Oh, there you are.

17:17.493 --> 17:19.163
I pooped in the prop toilet!

17:19.246 --> 17:20.664
Wha... Why would you do that?

17:20.748 --> 17:22.207
I thought it said "poop room"!

17:22.875 --> 17:26.962
[gasping] Okay. Okay. Don't panic.
I've been through this before.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.589
We simply walk away.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.384
If anyone asks, we were at the
Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.969
Okay. Good. Let's go.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Occupied! Occupied!

17:37.014 --> 17:38.932
I need the bathroom
set for the bully skit.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.226
[Miranda and Jim whimpering]

17:41.310 --> 17:44.146
Of course. Of course. We'll
have it right out to you.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.816
One empty toilet coming right
up. Just give us a minute, yes.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.360
[breathing heavily] Oh, my God!

17:50.444 --> 17:51.695
What're we gonna do?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.614
[breathing heavily]
Think. Think, Jim, think.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.949
Okay. I have an idea.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.535
I am going to poop on top of your poop.

17:58.619 --> 18:02.790
That way, they'll blame me, and no
one will know you're under there.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.417
Oh, thank you, Uncle
Jim. You're a real hero.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.753
[breathing heavily]

18:13.133 --> 18:15.511
- Here. I'll close my eyes.
- Please.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.096
I won't look.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.265
- Have you done it? I don't hear...
- No.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.767
No? Okay.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.855
- Can you hurry...
-Stop putting pressure on me, Miranda.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.566
- I'm not trying to... -Every
time you talk, it goes back up!

18:30.359 --> 18:31.235
Do you have any coffee?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.862
[Miranda through speakers]
Good job relaxing, Uncle Jim.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.031
Now give yourself a little massage.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.159
Squeeze the shoulders.
Squeeze the shoulders.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.663
- Oh, you found a hairy patch.
- Okay. All right. No, no, no.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.040
I think I should go in there.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.918
I've seen Jim use duct
tape and it's not pretty.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.044
No way.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.587
Somebody needs to stop them.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.256
Well, if you're that
concerned, then I'll go.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.633
- No, I can do it.
- No, you can't.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.641
[sighs]

19:02.724 --> 19:06.562
If you don't let me cheat off
your test, you get a swirly!

19:07.354 --> 19:08.438
Oh, no!

19:11.441 --> 19:12.401
Scene!

19:13.861 --> 19:15.279
Yeah, scene.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.038
[announcer] Next up, Fern
playing Miranda Sings.

19:25.122 --> 19:25.956
Now!

19:35.007 --> 19:39.094
I'm going to tell you
all a little story.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.930
I'm gonna tell you a
story about a little girl.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.141
A little girl named Fern.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.143
That's me. I'm Fern.

19:46.226 --> 19:51.106
And I love to impostitute celebrities
and steal all their views on YouTube

19:51.190 --> 19:55.527
and go to Broadway in their place
to become a legend instead of them.

19:55.611 --> 19:59.531
Well, I'm about to blow your
minds, 'cause I'm not Fern.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.368
I am a victim of impostitution.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.705
Because I am Miranda Sings!

20:13.128 --> 20:15.214
Oh. [Clears throat]

20:16.006 --> 20:20.177
Did you hear me? I'm Miranda
Sings. So, hold the applause.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.138
Don't actually hold it.
Do it. Applaud. No? Okay.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.765
Hello?

20:25.682 --> 20:28.143
Oh, and also, I did not
poop in the prop toilet.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.853
I did! I did it!

20:29.937 --> 20:31.980
- I pooped in the prop toilet.
- [audience murmuring]

20:32.064 --> 20:34.149
- Stop interrupting me, please.
- Oh, I'm trying to help.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.152
- You're not being very helpful right now.
- Well, continue, Miranda.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.780
- I am trying to continue, Uncle Jim.
- Well...

20:39.863 --> 20:42.491
Anyways, since you
haters don't believe me...

20:42.574 --> 20:43.742
[Jim] Nor me!

20:43.825 --> 20:45.244
Stop talking.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.246
Ignore everything that happened,

20:47.329 --> 20:51.541
'cause I'm about to prove that
I am Miranda and Fern is not.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.210
Now, Patrick!

20:53.293 --> 20:54.962
[audience exclaiming]

20:56.546 --> 21:00.092
This is the impostitute I
was telling you all about!

21:00.717 --> 21:02.928
[audience chattering indistinctly]

21:03.011 --> 21:07.182
Hey, you're that little perv
from the chat room last night.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.768
- Ava, you know this man?
- [Ava] No.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.896
Yes, you do. I showed
you my jar of human teeth.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.856
- What is going on?
- Oh, don't worry.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.484
There were lots of other
little girls there, too.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.361
Just stop interrupting!
Patrick, tie him up!

21:19.444 --> 21:21.280
- You need to learn to listen.
- Tie me up?

21:21.363 --> 21:23.991
Yes, I'm trying to expose a
little girl and you keep talking!

21:24.074 --> 21:26.493
And now to prove I'm the real Miranda,

21:26.576 --> 21:30.747
Uncle Jim will measure our chests
and expose Fern for who she really is.

21:30.831 --> 21:31.832
An impostor.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.209
- No, she's getting away!
- [Emily] Miranda, don't!

21:34.293 --> 21:36.128
- [audience gasps]
- Get off me!

21:36.211 --> 21:37.921
[indistinct yelling]

21:42.342 --> 21:43.552
That's enough!

21:44.761 --> 21:46.722
[Emily] Mom, go back to the van!

21:46.805 --> 21:50.183
No, Emily! I'm the mother
here. You go back to the van.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.977
Jim, Patrick, stop it!

21:52.060 --> 21:55.564
Miranda, get off of that poor
little prostitute. We're going home.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.900
See, everyone? She called
me Miranda. Case closed.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.361
- Now, Miranda!
- Okay.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.457
[thuds]

22:18.979 --> 22:20.981
[classical music playing]
