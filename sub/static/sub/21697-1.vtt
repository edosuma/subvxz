DAVID HASSELHOFF: Barry, do you hear that?

01:17.851 --> 01:21.481
<i>Superhero: The Musical!</i> I'm telling you,
I know what I'm talking about.

01:21.654 --> 01:25.887
Get on the phone. Call the heads of
all the studios. This is gonna be huge.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.692
- MAN: Chris!
- (WAILS)

01:29.229 --> 01:30.754
MAN: No!

01:34.067 --> 01:35.365
(GASPS)

01:36.469 --> 01:40.497
MAN: <i>I don't know what's worse:</i>
<i>a half-naked oiled-up David Hasselhoff</i>

01:40.673 --> 01:42.266
<i>or this bullet in my chest.</i>

01:42.375 --> 01:45.140
<i>You're probably asking yourself</i>
<i>how I got into this situation.</i>

01:45.278 --> 01:47.304
<i>Let's go back a few days.</i>

01:52.318 --> 01:56.779
<i>Tommy's house. Where it all started.</i>
<i>He's a reality TV producer.</i>

01:56.923 --> 02:00.291
<i>Anyway, we're all there for Tommy's</i>
<i>annual Celebrity Death Pool party.</i>

02:00.393 --> 02:01.554
<i>That's me, Chris.</i>

02:01.728 --> 02:05.165
<i>I own a nightclub called Habitat</i>
<i>that's barely making ends meet.</i>

02:05.298 --> 02:07.927
<i>My pick in the pool every year</i>
<i>is David Hasselhoff.</i>

02:08.067 --> 02:11.002
<i>I almost won last year as the Hoff</i>
<i>nearly plunged to his death</i>

02:11.137 --> 02:13.902
<i>skydiving blind on his reality show.</i>

02:14.007 --> 02:17.136
<i>As usual my luck didn't pan out</i>
<i>while Hasselhoff's did.</i>

02:17.710 --> 02:18.973
<i>I mean, as far as death pools go,</i>

02:19.112 --> 02:21.809
<i>I figured that was like drafting LeBron</i>
<i>right out of high school.</i>

02:21.948 --> 02:24.474
<i>What started out</i>
<i>as an innocent game with my boys</i>

02:24.584 --> 02:27.918
<i>ended up being</i>
<i>one of the worst weeks of my life.</i>

02:28.021 --> 02:29.614
(CHEERING)

02:29.789 --> 02:33.487
Six years ago today,
18 men, all of whom are here,

02:33.593 --> 02:35.994
chose one celebrity
and put $500 into a bank account.

02:36.129 --> 02:40.123
We then made a gentleman's agreement
that whoever's celebrity died first,

02:40.233 --> 02:43.431
that man would walk away with... $9,000.

02:43.570 --> 02:48.508
- And what's the total now, Tommy?
- A staggering, a shocking,

02:48.608 --> 02:51.942
may I say life-altering amount?

02:52.045 --> 02:55.038
$567,000.

02:55.181 --> 02:57.241
- (CHEERING)
- MAN: You could buy a lot of weed with that.

02:58.418 --> 03:02.150
So you want Hasselhoff to die
but you also booked his after party.

03:02.255 --> 03:05.350
- Isn't that a conflict of interest?
- I like to hedge my bets.

03:05.959 --> 03:10.624
I'm just curious. Would you rather have
the money or a lifetime of awful karma?

03:10.797 --> 03:13.062
So you wanna have the wedding
at Chuck E. Cheese?

03:13.199 --> 03:16.328
They have a house band there.
It's all animatronic robots.

03:16.436 --> 03:18.132
If it's cool with you, it's cool with me.

03:18.238 --> 03:21.470
It's definitely cool with me.
Sounds like the best wedding ever.

03:21.608 --> 03:25.170
You don't even have to buy gifts.
You could win 'em with tickets.

03:25.278 --> 03:27.838
It's amazing! Why is no one doing this?

03:27.981 --> 03:31.349
Time to re-ante.
Let me hear it, people. Come on.

03:31.451 --> 03:33.079
(CHEERING)

03:33.219 --> 03:37.782
With these contracts so begins
the Celebrity Death Pool 2016.

03:37.890 --> 03:38.983
(WHOOPING)

03:40.193 --> 03:44.392
Yes! Whoo!

03:44.497 --> 03:46.693
I remember a friend of mine
once saying to me,

03:46.866 --> 03:49.961
"A joint chequing account with Chris?
Chris Kim?"

03:50.069 --> 03:53.267
- And of course I objected.
- Ann, your trust will soon be rewarded.

03:53.406 --> 03:56.843
This is gonna be our year.
This man is definitely going to die.

03:56.976 --> 03:58.842
I can feel it in my motherfucking bones.

03:59.479 --> 04:01.846
- You're pathetic.
- Thank you.

04:01.981 --> 04:06.316
I just want you to know, I'm doing
this godawful terrible thing for us.

04:06.452 --> 04:07.476
Love you.

04:09.656 --> 04:13.024
CHRIS: <i>Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a little</i>
<i>sad that we bet on celebrities to die,</i>

04:13.126 --> 04:16.619
<i>but, hey, what can I say?</i>
<i>I don't have many hobbies.</i>

04:16.728 --> 04:18.129
Think maybe he's dead?

04:18.264 --> 04:20.858
- (KNOCKING)
- Fish? Did you kill yourself?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.936
Because if you didn't kill yourself,
answer the door.

04:24.637 --> 04:26.105
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:26.239 --> 04:28.299
Six years and you've never missed a re-ante.

04:28.441 --> 04:29.602
Where were you, buddy?

04:32.645 --> 04:36.605
Well, where shall I start? Oh, I know.

04:36.716 --> 04:39.015
My girlfriend's being probed
on a regular basis

04:39.118 --> 04:42.486
by some Antonio Banderas-looking
motherfucker with a massive dick.

04:42.622 --> 04:44.887
- So there's that.
- What are you talking about?

04:45.024 --> 04:48.085
Yesterday I accidentally hacked
into Jenn's Facebook account,

04:48.227 --> 04:49.354
like I normally do,

04:49.495 --> 04:53.262
and I'm reading her inbox,
two messages in, boom, there it is.

04:53.366 --> 04:57.269
A big description of some bastard
with a huge cock.

04:57.370 --> 04:59.839
- What?
- Here it is.

05:00.973 --> 05:03.465
- Sebastian Hollingbone.
- TOMMY: Damn!

05:03.576 --> 05:06.705
I know, right? It's like he's born
to be on the cover of a romance novel.

05:06.846 --> 05:10.942
He is the Latin Fabio. Oh, my God,
he is beautiful. Just chiselled and...

05:11.084 --> 05:13.986
Calm down, Tommy. Thank you.
You're not fucking helping.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.179
It's not natural.

05:15.321 --> 05:18.917
What makes you think Jenn is banging
this roided-out meathead anyway?

05:19.058 --> 05:22.051
Uh... This. And I shall recite.

05:22.562 --> 05:25.191
"I long to stroke on your foot-long cock.

05:25.331 --> 05:28.597
To lick it all over from the base to the top.

05:28.735 --> 05:32.001
Once it is hard I'd like it inside me,

05:32.138 --> 05:35.199
to poke and to prod
and to lead me to ecstasy."

05:35.341 --> 05:37.401
(CRIES)

05:39.112 --> 05:43.140
- Fuck! I've gotta stop reading it.
- Damn, that is graphic.

05:43.282 --> 05:44.682
I mean, what the fuck?

05:44.784 --> 05:48.721
Almost three years
and she's writing this guy dick poetry.

05:48.821 --> 05:50.949
Okay, yeah, that is a cock poem.

05:51.090 --> 05:54.788
But on the bright side
it is a terrible cock poem.

05:54.961 --> 05:58.329
Yeah. The metre's abysmal.
The rhymes are forced.

05:58.431 --> 06:00.366
She'll never get it published.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.801
Is... That's what you're telling me?
That it's not gonna get published?

06:04.971 --> 06:06.371
(LAUGHS)

06:07.507 --> 06:10.534
You fucking dickheads! That's not the point!

06:10.643 --> 06:12.373
The point is, why is she doing it?

06:12.512 --> 06:15.641
Jenn's barely even touched
my tiny knob recently.

06:16.816 --> 06:21.186
Let alone use iambic pentameter
to describe it.

06:22.021 --> 06:24.786
And now I know why. Because of Sebastian.

06:24.924 --> 06:26.916
Every fucking picture of him is shirtless!

06:27.059 --> 06:29.392
It's like he's allergic to shirts!

06:29.529 --> 06:32.226
I wear shirts.
You guys, you got shirts? Yeah?

06:32.365 --> 06:35.267
- Wearing a shirt right now.
- Yeah, cos you're fucking normal.

06:36.803 --> 06:38.328
(SOBS)

06:38.438 --> 06:41.636
Okay, dude, dude. Come on, man.
Fuck this guy. Fuck Jenn.

06:41.774 --> 06:43.766
Who the hell does she think
she's cheating on?

06:43.876 --> 06:46.175
You're Paul "the Fish" Fishman.

06:47.447 --> 06:48.745
Thanks, Tommy.

06:49.782 --> 06:53.878
But I've gotta be honest.
I don't have a very big dick.

06:54.053 --> 06:58.388
Okay, you know, neither do I. Just more of
a Korean genetic thing, but that's fine.

06:58.491 --> 07:02.622
That's why we own a Hollywood club.
We overcompensate. That's what we do.

07:02.762 --> 07:05.596
Once we renovate
you'll be knee-deep in all the pussy

07:05.698 --> 07:09.499
a 25 per cent investor
with a mediocre member can handle. Huh?

07:09.635 --> 07:11.297
- How do you like that?
- (SNIFFS)

07:11.437 --> 07:14.168
Yeah, obviously that...
that sounds good, you know.

07:15.174 --> 07:18.770
But I think I'm losing it. You know,
everywhere I look I see Sebastian.

07:19.912 --> 07:25.112
Everywhere. He's behind you,
by the way, mocking my tiny penis.

07:25.251 --> 07:26.981
(MAKES SQUEAKING SOUND)

07:27.119 --> 07:28.519
Hey, gotta remain positive.

07:28.654 --> 07:30.987
Where's the old optimistic Fish? Come on.

07:31.123 --> 07:35.993
(SIGHS) I don't know. I think he's been
defeated by Sebastian's hollingbone.

07:36.128 --> 07:39.895
Dude, I need you to be strong for me.
I really need you right now.

07:40.066 --> 07:42.092
- (YELLS)
- Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

07:42.235 --> 07:43.134
It... I'm just...

07:43.269 --> 07:45.431
- Shaking me all the time, you know?
- I'm sorry.

07:45.538 --> 07:47.939
Breakups suck. I get it.
You have nothing to worry about.

07:48.107 --> 07:51.635
- Okay, look. Blue skies ahead, buddy.
- TOMMY: You gotta buck the fuck up.

07:51.744 --> 07:55.010
Hasselhoff's throwing an after party
at your nightclub this Saturday.

07:55.147 --> 07:57.139
- The Hoff?
- The Hoff.

07:57.283 --> 08:00.014
- Is he gonna sing?
- Yes. No!

08:00.152 --> 08:04.151
No? Okay, good. I'll try and make it.

08:04.271 --> 08:08.102
If I'm still of sound body and mind. (CRIES)

08:09.662 --> 08:11.358
Yeah, okay.

08:11.497 --> 08:14.626
Wait, wait. That feels weird.

08:14.734 --> 08:16.134
- I'm sorry.
- Don't cry.

08:16.669 --> 08:18.729
CHRIS:
<i>So, yeah, I had Hasselhoff in the death pool</i>

08:18.871 --> 08:20.669
<i>and was also hosting his after party.</i>

08:21.440 --> 08:24.535
<i>Just cos I want Hasselhoff to die</i>
<i>doesn't mean that I'm not gonna try</i>

08:24.677 --> 08:27.442
<i>to make a couple of bucks off of him</i>
<i>while he's still alive.</i>

08:27.547 --> 08:29.311
<i>It's a win-win.</i>

08:29.448 --> 08:30.780
(DANCE MUSIC)

08:35.121 --> 08:40.719
There he is. Here's my guy. Come on.
Not you. Hey. How are you?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.852
- Hi, Tommy.
- You must be real proud of this guy.

08:43.962 --> 08:45.693
- Yeah, I am.
- (SIGHS)

08:45.798 --> 08:46.925
- Refill?
- Yes, please.

08:47.066 --> 08:48.090
Zoink.

08:48.901 --> 08:52.167
So... Ann, where's Susan?

08:53.105 --> 08:57.270
I'm sorry, but my roommate's never
gonna sleep with you. She's engaged.

08:57.376 --> 09:01.177
I forgot that she's engaged.
Why does she have to be engaged?

09:01.314 --> 09:03.806
Because engaged people
can't have sex with other people.

09:03.950 --> 09:06.977
But, wait, they can!
(LAUGHS) And I'm gonna do it.

09:07.119 --> 09:10.283
I'm gonna have sex with her and you
can't stop me from having sex with her

09:10.389 --> 09:13.223
because I'm already having sex
with her in my head right now.

09:13.359 --> 09:14.622
Oh... Ah...

09:14.760 --> 09:19.289
Okay, yeah, that's very nice, Susan.
Oh. Don't make Ann watch. That's...

09:19.398 --> 09:20.957
- Whoo!
- Stop.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.398
Copy that.

09:27.373 --> 09:29.001
Dolores.

09:30.376 --> 09:34.609
- Fishman, you okay?
- Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm...

09:35.348 --> 09:36.577
No. Yep.

09:36.716 --> 09:38.378
- Good lad.
- I...

09:38.517 --> 09:39.712
All right, everyone.

09:40.853 --> 09:46.793
Let's give a warm welcome to our founder
and CEO, Mr Richard Mayweather.

09:48.728 --> 09:49.752
MAN: Welcome.

09:50.162 --> 09:52.722
All right, let's get down to business.

09:52.832 --> 09:56.826
Now, company profits
have stalled in the third quarter.

09:56.969 --> 10:01.998
I've been thinking long and hard
about how to turn things around

10:02.141 --> 10:03.666
and here's some thoughts.

10:03.809 --> 10:08.941
I want you to consider the difference
between steel and pudding.

10:09.048 --> 10:11.176
(VOICE FADES)
They're both made out of molecules...

10:11.951 --> 10:13.852
(GASPS) Sebastian!

10:13.986 --> 10:18.253
(INHALES) It seems, my lady,

10:18.391 --> 10:20.860
that my manhood has sprung to attention.

10:21.594 --> 10:26.794
My dew-soaked ladydom awaits your staff!

10:26.899 --> 10:29.562
- (MOANS)
- I wish to ravish you on this table!

10:29.669 --> 10:32.070
- Sebastian! Yes, please!
- Oh!

10:32.204 --> 10:34.969
Ravish away, Sebastian.

10:35.074 --> 10:37.703
- My previous lover never gave me...
- Don't... Don't do that!

10:37.843 --> 10:41.905
That's right, Fishman.
We can no longer stay passive.

10:42.048 --> 10:43.778
(BOTH LAUGH)

10:44.884 --> 10:48.286
My desire must be sated
in the most forbidden of places.

10:48.421 --> 10:53.052
Now dispose of your skirt and prepare
to receive many sweet reams.

10:53.192 --> 10:54.854
Oh! Yes!

10:54.994 --> 10:56.656
(YELLS) No!

11:00.399 --> 11:01.799
(GROANS)

11:03.135 --> 11:05.331
You're not fucking her, do you hear?

11:05.471 --> 11:08.930
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
I'll rip your love muscle right off!

11:09.075 --> 11:11.408
Do you hear me? I'll kill you!

11:13.813 --> 11:15.247
(HIP-HOP MUSIC)

11:20.753 --> 11:24.155
- This is gonna be a big money night!
- It fucking better be.

11:25.691 --> 11:28.752
Chris, you worry too much about money.
Look at me.

11:28.894 --> 11:34.834
I have two pairs of pants, two pairs
of shirts, no underwear and I'm happy.

11:34.934 --> 11:38.871
- Yeah, cos you're always high.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah, I forgot about that.

11:38.971 --> 11:42.772
You even have weed in your hair.
Just a big...

11:44.543 --> 11:46.136
(LAUGHS)

11:46.278 --> 11:51.080
I've been looking all over for you!
I better go smoke this.

11:51.183 --> 11:55.780
Now if I'm not back in 20 minutes,
it means I forgot to come back.

11:55.921 --> 11:57.856
- What was I doing again?
- Good luck, Rob.

11:57.957 --> 12:01.860
Every time he walks away I feel like
it's the last time I'll ever see him.

12:03.696 --> 12:07.531
Amazing, tonight, everybody. Simply amazing.

12:07.666 --> 12:10.602
"Has he still got it?"
Hell, you never lost it.

12:10.736 --> 12:13.934
(LAUGHS) Hoo-hoo! Habitat, here we come!

Ah! Hey, Barry.

12:33.092 --> 12:35.618
Everything is all set
for Mr Hasselhoff's arrival,

12:35.761 --> 12:36.990
so what's the ETA?

12:37.129 --> 12:40.031
Chris, unfortunately we're not gonna
be able to make it tonight.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.322
Mr Wasserstein,
I'm actually asking for an extension.

18:38.457 --> 18:41.359
An extension? That's a...
That's a ballsy request.

18:41.493 --> 18:44.190
No, I just need a little more time.
Just, just anything.

18:44.329 --> 18:46.389
Mr Kim, if you'll indulge me a brief story.

18:46.532 --> 18:49.764
I call it the parable of the loaves.

18:49.935 --> 18:50.994
Jesus Christ.

18:54.072 --> 18:57.975
Years ago there was a ten-year-old boy
living in Brooklyn.

18:58.110 --> 19:01.137
His mother was crazy. His father a drunk.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.308
So naturally he had
to fend for himself most of the time

19:05.417 --> 19:06.976
and in that he was hungry,

19:07.119 --> 19:10.180
he took to stealing scraps of bread
from a local baker.

19:10.322 --> 19:15.351
They knew and it was no big deal.
But soon enough, the boy got cocky.

19:15.494 --> 19:17.156
He started stealing more and more.

19:17.296 --> 19:20.892
Now, the baker had a son
around the same age as this little boy

19:20.999 --> 19:27.132
and one day the baker's son witnessed
the boy stuffing an entire loaf of bread

19:27.239 --> 19:32.234
down into his drawstring pantaloons.
Now, stealing scraps, that's one thing.

19:32.377 --> 19:36.439
I'm sure you would agree an entire loaf,
well, that's another matter entirely.

19:37.015 --> 19:41.009
So for three months
the baker's son beat the boy bloody,

19:41.153 --> 19:44.783
until it was certain
that he had learned his lesson.

19:44.957 --> 19:47.552
That boy who stole the bread...

19:48.660 --> 19:51.061
- That was you?
- What? No. Fuck, no.

19:51.196 --> 19:53.825
I was the boy who beat the shit
out of that boy. The baker's son.

19:53.999 --> 19:55.262
The point is this, Mr Kim.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.232
You owe me $400,000

19:57.369 --> 20:02.205
and I really enjoy beating the shit
out of people who steal from me.

20:02.341 --> 20:04.572
I just need a little breathing room.

20:04.676 --> 20:06.770
Mr Kim, you should consider
your breathing room

20:06.945 --> 20:10.404
is the fact that you are now
currently still breathing.

20:13.952 --> 20:16.387
Now you gave me your word
that you would give me the 400K

20:16.488 --> 20:19.083

20:19.224 --> 20:23.685

man's word, all order is lost.

20:49.788 --> 20:51.120
I'm being hyperbolic?

20:51.256 --> 20:54.283
Yes! It's a whole loaf that he's
stuffing into a pair of drawstring...

20:54.426 --> 20:58.124
That's the whole point of the story.
It starts nice with a little scrap.

20:58.263 --> 21:01.290
I mean, he's looking at me like,
"Then what, then what?"

21:01.433 --> 21:03.402
You said pantaloons. You said pantaloons.

21:03.502 --> 21:06.062
- That's exactly what he was wearing.
- Whatever. Okay.

- That's what I had.
- Maybe you're right.

21:08.273 --> 21:11.141

and I watched him stuffing it.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.605
So you said you were gonna talk to Ann?

25:43.748 --> 25:45.216
- I did talk...
- Huh, pal?

25:45.383 --> 25:46.373
I did talk to her!

25:46.518 --> 25:48.180
- Chris!
- Chris!

25:49.688 --> 25:51.350
Where's Susan?

25:51.489 --> 25:52.718
- I don't know.
- Oh...

25:52.824 --> 25:54.622
It's a sebaceous cyst. It's not a big deal.

26:03.435 --> 26:05.995
(YELLS) Fuck! Fuck!

26:07.439 --> 26:08.702
(SOBS)

26:28.994 --> 26:31.156
When life shits on you...

26:32.631 --> 26:34.759
you shit right back.

26:34.866 --> 26:35.959
(TYRES SCREECH)

26:48.947 --> 26:50.643
- Hi, Fish.
- Hey.

26:51.616 --> 26:53.141
I don't know how to play this game.

26:53.251 --> 26:55.777
- Is that moustache real?
- Of course it's real.

26:56.888 --> 26:59.790
I'm sorry, you're... You're looking good.

26:59.891 --> 27:04.454
- Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?
- No, I'm fine.

27:04.596 --> 27:08.055
You sure?
I had the nurse make it. It's Colby.

27:08.199 --> 27:11.363
I'm actually in the middle
of a very exciting experiment.

27:11.503 --> 27:15.235
Every day I get a different sandwich
with the same cheese in it.

27:15.373 --> 27:16.773
Which cheese is winning?

27:17.375 --> 27:20.209
Well, it's the same cheese every time.
It's a Colby.

27:20.311 --> 27:22.007
(SIGHS)

27:23.281 --> 27:24.840
If you're not gonna eat that...

27:26.685 --> 27:27.812
it's gonna go to waste.

27:28.687 --> 27:32.624
Because I'm telling you now,
Sebastian will not touch it.

27:34.025 --> 27:37.928
He's over there. Look.
Lifting weights. Look at him.

27:38.797 --> 27:40.026
So muscly.

27:40.131 --> 27:42.396
Don't stare at him.
That's what he wants you to do.

27:42.534 --> 27:43.661
He likes it when you look.

27:43.802 --> 27:46.533
God, I'm so sorry. You really lost your mind.

27:47.472 --> 27:51.068
I don't think I've lost it.
I think it's been misplaced.

27:51.209 --> 27:52.700
- That's why I'm here.
- Yeah.

27:52.844 --> 27:55.245
I'm looking for it.
Searching around, you know?

27:55.947 --> 27:57.745
While we're on the subject of losing minds,

27:57.882 --> 28:01.046
I feel like I've... I've misplaced mine.

28:02.654 --> 28:05.146
- I heard that you molested some kids.
- No. No...

28:05.290 --> 28:08.124
- What the fuck you doing that for?
- No.

28:08.259 --> 28:09.750
I'm going off what I heard.

28:11.963 --> 28:15.058
I just found out that Ann is fucking Tommy.

28:15.166 --> 28:16.691
What the fuck?!

28:18.303 --> 28:21.831
- Ann is actually Tommy?
- No, no, no. No.

28:21.940 --> 28:23.306
That makes sense!

28:24.776 --> 28:28.144
You can see it. They're never
in the same room at the same time.

28:30.081 --> 28:31.982
No, they are. They are. A lot.

28:33.051 --> 28:35.520
They're in the same room a lot.
That makes no sense.

28:35.653 --> 28:38.248
No, my best friend is fucking Ann!

28:39.390 --> 28:43.452
I am not! You know what?
You get out! Security!

28:44.295 --> 28:46.958
G'day, mate.
Just another grilled cheese sandwich.

28:47.799 --> 28:53.136
- Yep. Two eyes. One pointer.
- Not you. Tommy!

28:53.905 --> 28:55.134
- Right.
- Yeah.

28:55.874 --> 28:57.137
I see.

28:58.076 --> 29:00.102
I'm not your best friend.

29:00.211 --> 29:01.679
I meant to say...

29:02.680 --> 29:04.478
Tommy's my second-best friend.

29:04.616 --> 29:08.212
Good. Okay. That's more like it.

29:08.353 --> 29:11.881
In fact, that's classic
second-best-friend behaviour.

29:13.324 --> 29:14.724
I feel for you.

29:16.427 --> 29:18.555
My life is in shambles, man.

29:18.696 --> 29:21.097
The only way I can deal with it is...

29:21.199 --> 29:23.395
(WHISPERS) I have to kill Hasselhoff.

29:28.306 --> 29:31.174
Yeah. It's the only way
to turn my life around.

29:31.309 --> 29:32.709
To win the death pool money.

29:33.745 --> 29:35.714
- He's had a pretty good life.
- Yes, yeah.

29:36.347 --> 29:41.047
Exactly. I'm not a murderer. I don't
want to do this. I'm not like Dexter.

29:41.186 --> 29:42.984
- Fuck, no. You're not Dexter.
- No.

29:43.121 --> 29:44.180
- You kidding me?
- Yeah.

29:44.322 --> 29:47.349
- He plans things out. He's meticulous.
- Thank you.

29:47.458 --> 29:48.983
Shh, shh, shh.

29:49.127 --> 29:53.155
Just keep things on the down.
Before Sebastian and I became buddies

29:53.264 --> 29:56.359
I actually wrote a list in my journal

29:56.467 --> 29:59.869
of the many ways I wanted to kill Sebastian.

30:00.405 --> 30:03.068
Now, it's pretty much endless.

30:03.208 --> 30:05.973
Well, it's three pages, but...
Check it out. Look.

30:06.077 --> 30:07.636
Gun, okay?

30:07.779 --> 30:09.543
Rope. Candlestick.

30:09.681 --> 30:12.446
I was playing a board game at the time
when I came up with those ones.

30:12.617 --> 30:15.086
Horse accident. Is he into horses?

30:15.887 --> 30:17.549
- No.
- I don't think so.

30:17.689 --> 30:20.682
A monkey attack. Scarf caught on sidecar.

30:20.825 --> 30:23.056
- You got a sidecar? No.
- No.

30:23.194 --> 30:24.856
Mortal Combat?

30:24.996 --> 30:26.294
- That's a game.
- Yeah.

30:26.431 --> 30:28.423
- Bullfight.
- Mm.

30:28.566 --> 30:29.659
Difficult.

30:29.801 --> 30:32.566
Funny berries?
Just sort of get him to come over.

30:32.704 --> 30:36.163
"Hey, look at these funny berries
I found in your garden.

30:36.274 --> 30:38.106
I've had a couple. They're fine."

30:38.877 --> 30:41.813
Sinkhole? You hear about those big holes
that suddenly appear?

30:41.913 --> 30:44.678
It was on the news.
Half a town's been swallowed up?

30:44.816 --> 30:46.284
Get him into one of those towns.

30:46.417 --> 30:50.718
Anyway, it's all in there. You take it.
It's out of my hands now, see?

30:50.855 --> 30:53.791
Now, don't show that to Sebastian
on your way out, will you?

30:53.892 --> 30:57.124
I know what you're thinking.
I've mended my bridges.

30:57.262 --> 30:59.595
This is for you, to burn yours.

31:01.065 --> 31:03.000
Thank you so much. Thank you, Fish.

31:03.101 --> 31:04.694
- Get well.
- All right. Good.

31:05.904 --> 31:08.032
Wait! Check it out.

31:08.139 --> 31:10.734
David Hasselhoff has a shellfish allergy.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.504
- That's my phone.
- Yeah, sorry about that. I just...

31:13.645 --> 31:15.910
I've learnt a bit of light finger in here.

31:16.047 --> 31:18.539
Anyway, that could help you out.
Shellfish allergy.

31:18.716 --> 31:20.446
- Okay. Thanks.
- Okay. All right. Go.

31:20.551 --> 31:21.610
Oh, wait.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.315
Here.

31:23.454 --> 31:26.014
Thirty Lorazepaz, all right?

31:26.958 --> 31:30.451
It says do not mix with grapefruit
juice. Could cause fatal reaction.

31:31.029 --> 31:33.328
Might help you on your job.

31:33.464 --> 31:35.228
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay. Good.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.564
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

31:37.735 --> 31:38.828
Wait!

31:44.575 --> 31:47.568
Take that as well.
Quick, before they see the switch.

31:50.348 --> 31:51.873
(COUGHS)

31:51.983 --> 31:53.144
I'm fine.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.319
CHRIS: <i>All right. Time to kill Hasselhoff.</i>

31:58.456 --> 32:01.051
<i>To be clear, this isn't about me.</i>

32:01.159 --> 32:02.684
<i>I'm doing society a favour.</i>

32:04.095 --> 32:08.123
<i>Okay, maybe it is about me,</i>
<i>but I had to gather some intel first.</i>

32:09.467 --> 32:10.958
(GRUNTS)

32:20.278 --> 32:23.305
- (GROANS)
- Cover your grey chest hair.

32:23.414 --> 32:25.076
(WHISTLING)

32:25.183 --> 32:30.019
David Hasselhoff!
I come bearing wonderful gifts.

32:30.154 --> 32:32.783
Is your manager
like the Penguin or something?

32:32.924 --> 32:36.156
Eight fantastic scripts.

32:37.595 --> 32:41.088
Not interested. What, you didn't
get my email last night?

32:41.199 --> 32:42.724
Yeah, I got it.

32:42.900 --> 32:46.029
- Are you drinking again?
- No, no.

32:46.704 --> 32:47.933
No.

32:48.039 --> 32:49.837
BARRY: <i>So you were thinking clearly</i>

32:49.974 --> 32:53.138
<i>when you sent me that email</i>
<i>that said two words:</i>

32:53.244 --> 32:55.372
superhero musical?

32:55.513 --> 32:58.142
- Superhero musical?
- <i>Crystal. Let's go down the list.</i>

32:58.249 --> 33:01.151
First of all, I have the voice of an angel.

33:01.652 --> 33:05.248
I look phenomenal in tights.
I'm stronger than most men.

33:05.390 --> 33:08.258
Even though I don't have
superhuman strength per se, I...

33:08.393 --> 33:11.192
All right. Let's just not forget something.

33:11.329 --> 33:14.128
You're David Hasselhoff.
You're not Christian Bale.

33:14.232 --> 33:16.633
- Whoa! Whoa. Whoa.
- Let me finish.

33:17.568 --> 33:22.131
Christian Bale
wishes he was David Hasselhoff.

33:22.240 --> 33:25.574
Thank you. Come on.
I'm super famous all over the world.

33:25.676 --> 33:28.441
I mean, hell, in half of Europe
I <i>am</i> a goddamn superhero!

33:28.579 --> 33:30.673
Barry, I know what your problem is.

33:30.848 --> 33:33.977
When you look at me you see this
perfectly chiselled tanned exterior.

33:34.085 --> 33:38.250
What you don't see underneath
is this complicated human heart I have.

33:38.389 --> 33:42.190
I wanna show the world the real me.
I wanna go full Hoff.

33:42.293 --> 33:44.785
Just read one script!
I'm begging you. Please!

33:44.962 --> 33:48.694
Look, if it's a rights issue,
we could create our own superhero.

33:48.866 --> 33:51.267
Like... Electric Man.

33:51.402 --> 33:54.566
He could shoot lightning bolts
out of his dick. (MAKES SHOOTING SOUND)

33:54.672 --> 33:58.200
- It isn't a rights issue.
- What?

33:58.309 --> 34:00.437
Do you remember
what we talked about last week?

34:00.578 --> 34:04.310
Obtainable goals. Obtainable.

34:04.449 --> 34:07.009
Barry, I have driven a talking car.

34:07.118 --> 34:10.646
I have saved people's lives
from mutant electric eels.

34:10.788 --> 34:14.315
- On TV!
- And in real life.

34:17.929 --> 34:21.491
You have an autograph signing
in two hours. Let's just focus on that.

34:21.632 --> 34:23.658
Because <i>that</i> is real.

34:23.801 --> 34:28.068
And I am a goddamn certified
modern-day superhero.

34:28.206 --> 34:32.074
And I am going to prove it to you. Love you.

34:35.112 --> 34:36.478
Mean it.

34:37.315 --> 34:39.284
Hoo-ah! (SIGHS)

34:40.485 --> 34:43.512
Great. Now I've gotta kill a guy
who shoots lightning out of his dick.

34:58.302 --> 35:00.168
- (SCREAMS)
- Sit down.

35:01.172 --> 35:03.573
Sit. May I?

35:05.309 --> 35:06.641
Please, relax.

35:07.478 --> 35:09.572
(CLEARS THROAT) I realise this is probably

35:09.714 --> 35:11.273
a highly unpleasant situation for you

35:11.382 --> 35:14.079
so let's do some deep breathing
so as to better centre ourselves.

35:14.185 --> 35:15.744
What do you say?

35:16.787 --> 35:19.086
All right. (INHALES)

35:19.190 --> 35:20.522
(EXHALES)

35:20.658 --> 35:23.594
(INHALES AND EXHALES)

35:23.728 --> 35:25.094
There. All better.

35:25.763 --> 35:28.062
I want you to tell me
where I can find Chris Kim.

35:28.166 --> 35:31.796
- I don't know where he is.
- Bullshit. Start talking, lady.

35:31.936 --> 35:36.306
It's... it's the truth. I swear.
He thinks I slept with his best friend.

35:36.407 --> 35:38.808
- I haven't been in touch with him.
- Who gives a fuck?

35:38.943 --> 35:41.879
Chris tells me that you two
share a joint bank account?

35:42.013 --> 35:44.744
- I would like to see that.
- It's basically empty.

35:44.882 --> 35:47.943
Chris is terrible with money.
He's in way over his head.

35:48.119 --> 35:51.715
- Yes. He is.
- Please don't hurt him.

35:51.822 --> 35:56.123
Little lady, please don't be confused
by my tranquillity.

35:56.227 --> 35:58.822
You're sitting with a man
who does bad things to good people.

35:58.963 --> 36:00.591
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey.

36:00.731 --> 36:02.359
Hey.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.731
You can check. There's nothing.

36:05.636 --> 36:07.366
My cheque book is in there. You can...

36:13.110 --> 36:16.046
You expect me to believe
he has nothing? No investments?

36:16.180 --> 36:18.206
No 401K? IRA? Nothing at all?

36:18.349 --> 36:21.251
He doesn't have any investments.
He's... (SIGHS)

36:21.385 --> 36:24.321
Unless David Hasselhoff drops dead,
he's basically destitute.

36:24.422 --> 36:26.050
Wait. Whoa. Excuse me. What was that?

36:26.190 --> 36:29.183
- He doesn't have any money.
- Not that part. The talking-car guy.

36:29.327 --> 36:31.728
- What are you talking about?
- Hasselhoff.

36:31.829 --> 36:35.163
Chris is in some stupid
celebrity death pool with his friends.

36:35.266 --> 36:38.759
If David Hasselhoff dies, he wins
something like a half a million dollars.

36:38.869 --> 36:42.397
Half-mil if the Hoff kicks the bucket?
Fuck me. I want a piece of that.

36:42.540 --> 36:46.068
Yeah, you know what? I do too.

36:46.744 --> 36:49.737
All right. Thank you very much for
your time. We'll see ourselves out.

36:49.847 --> 36:52.282
Nick, what's the name of that place
we passed on the way in?

36:52.416 --> 36:54.442
- NICK: Cattleman's?
- Yeah. I could use a steak.

36:54.585 --> 36:58.386
Sounds good. Maybe a blooming onion.
Should I leave this closed or open?

37:00.191 --> 37:02.490
- I'll just leave it open.
- (ANN SOBS)

37:06.030 --> 37:07.225
(ENGINE STARTS)

37:09.800 --> 37:12.702
Be damned if this jacket
doesn't fit just like a glove.

37:12.837 --> 37:16.968
- David, you look great.
- Like a second skin, Barry.

37:17.108 --> 37:20.203
You know, I hate to sound egotistical,
but if I was a woman, I would...

37:20.311 --> 37:23.770
You'd do yourself. Yes, I know.
You said that inside already.

37:23.881 --> 37:28.114
And honestly, buddy, there's no way to
say that without sounding egotistical,

37:28.252 --> 37:30.687
so you just might wanna
pump the brakes on that one.

37:30.821 --> 37:33.256
Okay, let's get going. We're running late.

37:33.391 --> 37:37.021
- KITT, calculate time to destination.
- KITT: <i>Calculating, Michael.</i>

37:37.194 --> 37:41.928
Time to destination:
12 minutes, 14.63 seconds.

37:42.066 --> 37:44.626
Oh, no, no. I missed a spot.

37:47.471 --> 37:49.838
- Thanks, buddy.
- Seriously?

37:49.940 --> 37:53.138
- How much is he paying you?
- Nothing. He...

37:53.277 --> 37:56.008
He's hooking me up with a part
in his superhero musical, man.

37:56.147 --> 37:59.208

You know what?
There's gotta be another choice.
