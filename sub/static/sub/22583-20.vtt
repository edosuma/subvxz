00:01.300 --> 00:03.210
Previously on Enterprise

00:08.420 --> 00:10.790
We don't have a complete casualty list yet ...

00:10.920 --> 00:12.550
but so far the news isn't good.

00:12.550 --> 00:15.550
Five people are confirmed dead, dozens wounded.

00:15.810 --> 00:18.660
If you destroy Earth, you won't just be
eliminating my species.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.420
You'll be eliminating your own!

00:20.420 --> 00:22.540
Do you have any idea why they released you?

00:22.610 --> 00:24.560
I think I may have gotten through to one of them.

00:26.010 --> 00:26.880
Degra.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.680
We were told the Reptilians attempted
to build a bio-weapon.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.040
Who told you this?

00:32.040 --> 00:37.450
We've also learned that they were building
this bio-weapon in the past on Earth.

00:39.300 --> 00:44.700
When I was exposed to trellium
it affected me in a way I wasn't prepared for.

00:44.790 --> 00:48.180
I discovered I was able to access certain emotions.

00:48.680 --> 00:49.640
I wanted more.

00:50.090 --> 00:52.940
I devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.820
You must have known it was dangerous.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.320
Trellium exposure is deadly to Vulcans.

01:02.070 --> 01:04.760
Elizabeth, get out of there!

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:16.940 --> 01:19.730
We're in bad shape...
I can't deny that.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.600
But we're still in one piece.

01:22.090 --> 01:24.600
Enterprise is a tough ship.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.290
She took more than anyone could ask her to,
and then some.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.700
And so have all of you.

01:33.410 --> 01:35.100
I wanted to say thank you.

01:37.750 --> 01:41.260
I only wish I could thank
the 18 crewmen who were lost.

01:43.130 --> 01:47.390
Like you, they understood how important our mission is...

01:47.750 --> 01:49.710
and they accepted the risks.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.300
We came into the Expanse
not knowing what we'd find,...

01:54.640 --> 01:56.960
with no one to rely on but ourselves.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.470
But we're going to succeed...

02:01.240 --> 02:03.240
To accomplish our mission...

02:04.580 --> 02:07.210
for everyone on Earth who's relying on us...

02:09.770 --> 02:11.390
and for the 18.

03:32.230 --> 03:35.890
We managed to get into Sections Six
and Seven on C-Deck.

03:36.570 --> 03:38.310
We found Taylor and Kamata.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.460
That accounts for everyone.

03:41.310 --> 03:42.700
What's our status on weapons?

03:42.790 --> 03:44.560
Mr. Reed has both...

03:44.690 --> 03:49.570
forward phase-cannons back on-line in addition
to the aft torpedo launchers.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.500
Hull plating is up to 80%.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.070
That'll have to do.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.430
We could wait--

03:55.430 --> 03:57.830
hang back until we've had a chance
to make more repairs.

03:57.890 --> 03:59.360
Degra's message was clear--

03:59.360 --> 04:01.370
we're to meet him ten hours from now.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.820
And I don't intend to be late.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.360
Maybe that's what he's counting on.

04:04.810 --> 04:07.080
Lure us into an ambush while
we're still licking our wounds.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.660
I've made my decision.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.660
We have got a lot of work to do.
I suggest we get to it.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.410
Aye, sir.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.010
Commander...

04:19.750 --> 04:21.750
Crewman Taylor was one of yours, wasn't she?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.750
She was an EPS control specialist...

04:26.010 --> 04:27.470
a damn good one.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.860
I'd like you to write a letter to her family.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.960
She worked on Rostov's team.
I can ask him.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.330
I asked you.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.330
I'm barely holding the ship together.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.120
I don't have time to sit down and write a letter.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.800
It doesn't have to be long, ...

04:47.860 --> 04:50.340
but her family deserves to know
what happened to her.

04:53.040 --> 04:53.750
Understood.

05:06.290 --> 05:07.600
You're busy.
I'll come back.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.340
have a seat.

05:09.890 --> 05:11.370
I'll have to use a hand-scanner.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.780
The Imaging Chamber is still off-line.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.400
Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team
that was working here.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.030
He said the Armory was a "higher priority."

05:22.820 --> 05:27.010
We'll see how low a priority I am the next time
he burns his fingers on a plasma conduit.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.950
You've experienced no further withdrawal symptoms?

05:32.330 --> 05:32.930
None.

05:33.610 --> 05:36.130
I'm only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system...

05:36.440 --> 05:37.670
hardly worth mentioning.

05:39.190 --> 05:40.670
That's good news.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.660
What is it?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.150
These emotions...

05:51.180 --> 05:53.270
have grown more difficult to control.

05:54.470 --> 05:58.040
My usual techniques for suppressing
them haven't been effective.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.340
On Earth, there's a cautionary tale
about the dangers of releasing...

06:08.440 --> 06:12.610
a magical creature called a "genie" from a bottle.

06:13.030 --> 06:16.100
Once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in.

06:17.540 --> 06:20.130
Are you saying these emotions may never subside?

06:20.250 --> 06:22.460
You used trellium for three months.

06:23.170 --> 06:26.250
It caused significant damage to your neural pathways.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.580
You may have to learn to live with these emotions.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.760
We're approaching the coordinates, Captain,
right on schedule.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.770
No ships out there, sir.

06:43.720 --> 06:44.400
Hoshi?

06:45.180 --> 06:46.670
Scanning all frequencies.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.510
Nothing so far.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.310
Maybe they're running late.

06:51.980 --> 06:53.310
Tactical alert!

06:53.310 --> 06:54.740
It's a spatial anomaly.

06:56.770 --> 06:58.530
We've entered a dense field.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.830
Tucker to the Bridge!
This is not the best time for this!

07:07.830 --> 07:09.220
Stand by, Trip.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.090
Reports of injuries on B-Deck.

07:16.150 --> 07:17.840
No one's out there, sir.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.940
-Get us out of here.
-Aye, sir.

07:22.770 --> 07:23.720
Captain.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.530
We're receiving a transmission.

07:31.990 --> 07:34.530
It's Degra and he's telling us to follow him.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.480
-Stay with him, Travis.
- Aye, sir.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.550
They're hailing us.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.250
I see you found my message.

08:03.390 --> 08:06.250
We have a great deal to discuss,
and I don't have much time.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.810
Come aboard my ship.

08:13.140 --> 08:15.710
If we'd left you with the Reptilians, they would have killed you.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.570
Degra arranged for the Aquatics
to return you to your ship.

08:20.150 --> 08:23.080
Then you also called off the attack on Enterprise?

08:24.090 --> 08:26.660
The Reptilians weren't very pleased about that either.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.530
You've taking a big risk.

08:28.900 --> 08:34.220
If you're telling the truth,
the future of my people is at stake.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.030
Everything I've told you is true.

08:38.220 --> 08:39.890
Forgive me, ...

08:40.039 --> 08:42.610
but the Council will need more than your word.

08:43.049 --> 08:46.660
Perhaps you can demonstrate your ability to time travel.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.350
That might be a bit difficult.

08:57.180 --> 08:58.940
But if you come aboard my ship,

08:59.750 --> 09:01.830
I can give you all the proof you want.

09:04.070 --> 09:04.830
Very well.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.550
But there are some things I want to know first.

09:07.550 --> 09:08.370
Such as?

09:09.150 --> 09:11.370
When will your weapon be launched?

09:14.110 --> 09:16.250
The precise date hasn't been determined yet.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.560
Weeks...

09:17.560 --> 09:19.760
-days?
- That's up to the Council.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.330
I'm trying to help you, ....

09:21.420 --> 09:24.510
but I need to know my world isn't being destroyed
while I'm doing it.

09:24.870 --> 09:27.060
The weapon won't be launched for several days.

09:27.350 --> 09:29.870
Show us your proof...

09:31.530 --> 09:33.760
and we'll do what we can to stop it.

10:01.820 --> 10:02.970
What did you get?

10:05.170 --> 10:06.480
Pepperoni pizza.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.650
Don't worry.
You can pick the pepperoni off.

10:13.990 --> 10:14.750
Damage reports?

10:15.470 --> 10:17.040
No.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.040
The Captain wants me to write a letter
to Crewman Taylor's family.

10:21.060 --> 10:22.630
I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

10:24.410 --> 10:25.630
Their daughter's dead.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.010
You really think they'll care what I have to say?

10:32.410 --> 10:33.760
When was the last time you slept?

10:34.580 --> 10:35.400
I don't know.

10:36.340 --> 10:37.510
Not since the attack.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.870
That was two days ago.

10:39.070 --> 10:40.080
All right, then.

10:40.350 --> 10:41.540
Two days.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.910
Go to your quarters.

10:49.470 --> 10:50.780
Get some sleep.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.790
Believe me, I'd love to.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.490
I could order you.

10:54.710 --> 10:56.000
I don't have time.

10:56.690 --> 11:00.040
We're full of holes, the only thing
keeping us flying is a stolen warp coil, ...

11:00.590 --> 11:02.310
and now I got to write this letter.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.870
What the hell...?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.360
Tucker to Engineering!

11:21.500 --> 11:24.330
Shut down the auxiliary coolant lines
between Sections...

11:24.330 --> 11:26.840
-12 and 14 on E-deck!
-Aye, sir.

11:31.010 --> 11:31.970
Tucker to Sick Bay.

11:32.370 --> 11:34.410
Medical emergency on E-deck, Section 12.

11:34.410 --> 11:36.260
On my way, Commander.

11:38.140 --> 11:39.760
Reactor pressure's holding.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.760
Good thing I wasn't taking a nap.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.460
Damron.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.360
Friend of yours?

11:58.460 --> 11:59.330
A colleague...

11:59.830 --> 12:00.810
of sorts.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.780
They're the ones we found on Earth...

12:03.040 --> 12:04.000
in the past.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.650
And this is the result of your "finding" them?

12:06.750 --> 12:10.880
They were about to release a bio-weapon
that would have decimated the population.

12:11.990 --> 12:16.690
The Reptilians felt a toxin would be
more effective on your species.

12:16.820 --> 12:21.090
Damron and his team disappeared shortly
after the Council rejected his proposal.

12:21.880 --> 12:26.180
Apparently, they decided to go ahead
without your Council's approval.

12:26.480 --> 12:30.630
But, fortunately, you were able to stop them
by traveling back through time.

12:30.760 --> 12:31.920
I already told you...

12:32.150 --> 12:33.220
we had help...

12:33.360 --> 12:34.450
just like they did.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.240
This proves nothing.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.240
How do we know he didn't capture
them in the present?

12:40.780 --> 12:42.520
You need more evidence?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.530
They had this with them.

13:26.930 --> 13:30.200
We destroyed the toxin,
but my doctor kept a sample of it in stasis.

13:31.460 --> 13:34.070
This appears to be Xindi technology,...

13:34.610 --> 13:37.140
but I'd like to have our engineers confirm it.

13:37.140 --> 13:38.360
Have them come aboard...

13:38.830 --> 13:40.340
perform whatever tests they'd like.

13:40.340 --> 13:43.770
This proves nothing except
the Reptilians disobeyed the Council.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.840
Which comes as no great surprise.

13:46.460 --> 13:47.950
But you also claim that ...

13:48.040 --> 13:51.440
we've been misled by trans-dimensional aliens.

13:51.770 --> 13:53.480
Where is your evidence of that?

14:02.160 --> 14:03.360
Come with me.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.540
There's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.900
-That's why it ruptured!
-I ran a pressure test.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.720
Tell it to the man lying in Sick Bay!

14:09.910 --> 14:12.540
-Test them again-- all of them!
-Aye, sir.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.420
-Commander?
-I'm a little busy, Doc.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.930
So it seems.

14:16.970 --> 14:19.590
I understand you haven't slept since the attack.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.040
T'Pol tattling on me now?

14:22.040 --> 14:23.180
She's worried about you.

14:23.280 --> 14:27.420
Well, I appreciate that, but I'm trying to hold
this ship together with spit and baling wire.

14:28.210 --> 14:32.250
Has it occurred to you that we'll be
far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.550
Your concern is duly noted, Doc,
but I got to get back to work.

14:35.550 --> 14:36.870
I don't believe so.

14:39.580 --> 14:40.560
Come again.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.970
I'm relieving you of duty.

14:41.970 --> 14:46.050
You will go to your quarters, and not return
to your post before 05:00 tomorrow.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.460
-Six hours?
- Please don't make me involve Security.

14:50.270 --> 14:52.070
Archer to Doctor Phlox.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.180
-Yes, Captain?
-I need you in Sick Bay.

14:57.570 --> 14:58.930
I'll be right there.

15:00.670 --> 15:01.930
Well, Commander?

15:02.380 --> 15:03.690
I could give you two hours.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.950
I believe the number was six.

15:05.950 --> 15:09.850
If I'm gone longer than three,
there may not be a ship here when I get back.

15:10.730 --> 15:11.630
Four.

15:11.930 --> 15:13.160
Not a minute less.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.430
Done.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.130
And remind me never to buy a car from you.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.710
-Captain's waiting for you.
- I'm aware of that.

15:32.010 --> 15:33.890
good night, then.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.460
We found him adrift.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.810
Do you recognize his species?

15:54.030 --> 15:55.490
We've met one of them.

15:56.590 --> 15:58.080
What caused his death?

15:58.220 --> 16:00.260
Some kind of cellular degeneration.

16:00.430 --> 16:02.170
It started the moment he was taken off his ship.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.270
Perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him.

16:04.270 --> 16:06.750
I believe our universe was toxic to him.

16:08.270 --> 16:10.380
His species evolved in a different dimension, ...

16:10.490 --> 16:13.280
under a different set of physical laws.
He simply couldn't exist here.

16:13.650 --> 16:16.280
That's why his species built the Spheres--

16:16.780 --> 16:19.900
to make our space more compatible for themselves.

16:19.900 --> 16:23.220
We believe he was a test subject sent here
to see if they were succeeding.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.930
And, if they are, you're saying
the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us.

16:29.650 --> 16:30.930
For any of us.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.960
We're destined to form an alliance to stop them.

16:36.940 --> 16:38.960
But, if you destroy Earth, that'll never happen.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.140
You'll be condemning your own race to extinction.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.350
Trouble sleeping, sir?

17:45.470 --> 17:46.300
Taylor?

17:48.720 --> 17:49.870
You were killed.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.560
This whole section decompressed.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.560
Did you find a sealed compartment?

17:57.700 --> 17:58.530
No.

18:00.170 --> 18:01.530
Then how...?

18:05.210 --> 18:06.140
You're dead...

18:08.340 --> 18:09.570
and I'm dreaming.

18:11.130 --> 18:12.140
The letter...

18:12.240 --> 18:13.460
How's it going?

18:14.550 --> 18:15.780
I got as far as...

18:18.200 --> 18:19.730
"I regret to inform you..."

18:20.480 --> 18:22.030
That's a little dry, sir.

18:23.130 --> 18:24.490
You're not real.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.490
You don't have to call me "sir."

18:28.460 --> 18:29.810
So what's the problem?

18:30.380 --> 18:32.920
The letter doesn't have to be long.
The Captain told you that.

18:38.330 --> 18:39.930
You can't think of anything.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.440
I wish it was that simple.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.900
I served on Enterprise for three years.

18:46.340 --> 18:49.230
You pulled me off the Saratoga to be on your team.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.230
Captain Brody was pretty angry at you.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.100
I forgot about that.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.360
You told me I'd make a fine Chief Engineer someday.

18:57.950 --> 18:59.040
You will.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.470
You would have.

19:03.820 --> 19:05.650
Then tell my parents that.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.490
Tell them about the practical jokes
Rostov used to play on me.

19:09.490 --> 19:13.440
Or that one time I found that glitch
in the injector assembly that everyone else missed.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.230
Tell them how hard I worked.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.230
How much you liked me.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.780
Why can't you look at me?

19:27.840 --> 19:30.420
Just remember me.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.200
Is that asking so much?

19:35.220 --> 19:35.960
Yes.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.640
Why?

19:40.940 --> 19:41.900
Why?

19:56.410 --> 19:58.920
These tests only confirm the equipment belonged ...

19:58.920 --> 20:02.200
-to the Reptilians.
-There's also evidence of chronometric distortion...

20:02.200 --> 20:03.250
time travel.

20:03.290 --> 20:04.760
The readings could have been fabricated.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.760
You're determined not to trust him.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.430
No more than you seem to be determined
to believe whatever he says.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.740
Now, I admit Archer's evidence is intriguing, ...

20:14.060 --> 20:16.020
but we barely know this human.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.440
Our contact from the future has helped us many times.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.470
She brought this Council together.

20:21.510 --> 20:24.640
And you've never wondered whether
she might have an agenda of her own?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.460
I am not a fool, Degra.

20:27.210 --> 20:28.430
All I'm saying is that it'll take....

20:28.430 --> 20:33.060
a little more than a few chronometric distortions
to turn the Council against her.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.460
Captain Archer is expecting me.

20:37.660 --> 20:39.050
More evidence?

20:39.170 --> 20:42.610
He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres.

20:43.870 --> 20:45.000
Degra...

20:46.690 --> 20:49.480
I know you've had doubts about building the weapon.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.480
Don't let them cloud your judgment.

20:59.230 --> 21:02.200
We've been working to reconstruct our database.

21:02.230 --> 21:04.810
The pounding your ships gave us didn't help much.

21:05.790 --> 21:06.830
Try it now.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.060
I'm going to reset the optical subprocessors.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.960
That might clear it up.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.180
When we slipped through your detection grid, ...

21:18.560 --> 21:20.580
we got a look at the weapon you're building.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.660
An impressive piece of engineering.

21:24.020 --> 21:26.960
Hell, it'd take at least...

21:27.500 --> 21:31.100
a thousand starships like Enterprise
to blow up an entire planet.

21:31.340 --> 21:35.210
You know, I'd like to see the telemetry from
the probe you launched against Earth.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.310
Increase the data resolution.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.060
I assume you were watching the attack.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.810
Calculating the blast yields.

21:49.390 --> 21:50.220
Boy.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.470
You must have been pretty damn excited.

21:53.870 --> 21:59.070
I mean, that beam cut one hell of
a swath through Florida.

21:59.690 --> 22:02.590
That's the name of one of the places you destroyed.

22:02.590 --> 22:03.590
Florida.

22:04.920 --> 22:05.610
Commander.

22:05.610 --> 22:08.850
Did you actually see the cities burning, the houses...

22:08.920 --> 22:11.040
the people being vaporized?

22:11.900 --> 22:13.250
You know, I had a sister there.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.680
Commander.

22:19.510 --> 22:21.120
How are the repairs coming?

22:21.150 --> 22:23.710
Just need a few more minutes, Captain.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.360
Why don't you join me in my Ready Room
until they're finished.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.530
Let's stick to the job at hand.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.410
Aye, sir.

22:55.110 --> 22:57.960
The Captain is trying to gain Degra's trust.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.660
It's one of the warp plasma conduits.

23:21.660 --> 23:24.060
It must have ruptured when
our sensors were off-line.

23:24.060 --> 23:25.870
Perhaps my crew can help.

23:25.950 --> 23:27.190
We'll handle it.

23:27.510 --> 23:29.250
We'll need to shut down the main plasma feeds.

23:29.390 --> 23:30.860
The flow regulators are damaged.

23:30.860 --> 23:34.720
There are manual cut-offs here and here,
but we can only access it from outside.

23:34.850 --> 23:36.430
That's very close to the fire.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.040
We don't have a choice.

23:39.390 --> 23:42.000
If we don't get control of it fast,
it'll spread to the reactor.

23:42.120 --> 23:42.960
Get going.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.710
-I could use a hand.
-That would be me, sir.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.780
Open that panel and
I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.630
-Where's the other valve?
-Over there.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.400
I need to open the emergency bypass ports first.

25:04.810 --> 25:09.010
You can't close your valve until I release
the pressure from the secondary line.

25:10.380 --> 25:11.470
Commander.

25:13.020 --> 25:14.470
I have a problem.

25:16.650 --> 25:18.420
I think the heat's warped the metal.

25:18.830 --> 25:20.300
The panel won't open.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.120
Use your plasma torch.

25:22.300 --> 25:23.520
I'll be there in a minute.

25:24.030 --> 25:26.590
I'm releasing the interlocks on the first port.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.380
This is going to take a while.

25:39.430 --> 25:42.200
Careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, Malcolm.

25:43.350 --> 25:45.200
The manifold pressure is increasing.

25:45.290 --> 25:48.670
We have less than six minutes
before the fire reaches the reactor shielding.

25:50.510 --> 25:51.670
Archer to Trip.

25:51.980 --> 25:53.400
You've got six minutes.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.690
Understood.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.770
You okay, Malcolm?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.770
I'm almost there.

26:06.420 --> 26:07.380
Captain.

26:08.130 --> 26:10.900
The temperature in Lieutenant Reed's suit
is over 44 degrees.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.330
He's too close to the fire.

26:12.330 --> 26:14.030
His EV suit can't compensate.

26:14.030 --> 26:14.900
Malcolm.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.740
Get back to the airlock.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.210
I'm almost finished, Captain.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.600
That's an order.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.710
Get inside, Malcolm.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.330
I can wrap it up.

26:38.410 --> 26:40.650
I'm opening the primary bypass port.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.700
Two more to go, and... we're in business!

26:52.720 --> 26:54.170
46 degrees.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.060
Malcolm.

26:55.060 --> 26:56.520
I'm sorry, sir.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.520
You're breaking up

27:02.510 --> 27:05.170
Get inside, Malcolm! I can finish.

27:05.170 --> 27:06.450
There's no time.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.950
Do what you have to do so I can shut this down!

27:08.950 --> 27:11.750
A few more seconds! I'm purging the last port.

27:17.630 --> 27:19.220
The forward valve is closed.

27:22.770 --> 27:25.790
Okay, Malcolm, clockwise 90 degrees.

27:40.810 --> 27:42.020
Nice work, Malcolm.

27:43.830 --> 27:48.390
Malcolm? Malcolm!

27:50.030 --> 27:51.390
Tucker to Doctor Phlox.

27:51.390 --> 27:53.080
Meet us in the airlock.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.920
We need to bring his body temperature down.
Let's geto Sick Bay.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.990
I hope he'll be all right.

28:16.790 --> 28:18.580
What's one more dead human to you?

28:18.580 --> 28:19.380
Trip...

28:19.570 --> 28:21.140
You had no problem killing seven million of us.

28:21.140 --> 28:22.920
But seven million and one is more than you can...

28:22.920 --> 28:23.930
-stomach?
-That's enough.

28:23.930 --> 28:26.300
-I guess even Xindi have their limits.
-I said, that's enough!

28:28.150 --> 28:29.980
Aye, aye, sir.

28:46.670 --> 28:49.300
We've determined there are 59 of them.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.640
78 at our last count.

28:52.770 --> 28:53.970
Seventy-eight?

28:54.350 --> 28:56.880
We've had more time to study them than you have.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.450
I apologize for Mister Tucker.

29:14.200 --> 29:19.910
I never expected to meet anyone
who'd suffered because of what I'd done.

29:19.910 --> 29:24.700
At the time, I thought the attack was necessary
to save my people.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.320
I know.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.320
Believe it or not, we've had this conversation before.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.090
That's right.

29:32.650 --> 29:36.210
Our "escape" from prison together.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.750
The Reptilians are correct about one thing, Captain.

29:43.150 --> 29:45.810
You have an impressive facility for deception.

29:49.150 --> 29:53.110
Erasing your memory probably wasn't
the best way to earn your trust.

29:53.730 --> 29:55.170
Probably not.

29:56.970 --> 30:00.210
They're all connected by a subspace energy grid.

30:00.210 --> 30:03.660
Unfortunately our data on
the Spheres' interiors is extremely limited.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.230
Maybe I can help.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.740
How did you get this?

30:18.880 --> 30:21.180
The first Sphere we came across was damaged.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.410
There was a breach in the outer shell.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.760
We've never been able to gain access to one.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.660
These scans are remarkably detailed
for a military vessel.

30:32.140 --> 30:36.690
Enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration.

30:37.980 --> 30:42.090
If we're successful, it will be again.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.630
Computer, begin recording.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.870
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.210
I regret to inform you that
your daughter was killed in the line of duty.

31:00.070 --> 31:02.100
She was a fine engineer, ...

31:03.410 --> 31:06.290
and she died performing her duties.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.390
Computer, stop recording.

31:11.290 --> 31:12.410
Delete that.

31:22.950 --> 31:24.620
Computer, start again.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.470
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.470
As Jane's commanding officer,...

31:34.020 --> 31:36.920
it's with deepest regret that I inform you of her death.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.600
She was a diligent engineer.

31:43.220 --> 31:44.720
Very hard-working...

31:44.790 --> 31:45.710
Tactical Alert.

31:45.710 --> 31:47.540
All hands to stations.

31:49.530 --> 31:50.530
Report.

31:50.530 --> 31:51.930
We've detected a ship.

31:51.930 --> 31:53.610
They just passed through the cloaking barrier.

31:53.610 --> 31:54.840
On screen.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.120
Reptilians.

32:01.730 --> 32:05.140
-Did you invite anyone else?
-We masked our warp trail.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.850
I don't know how they found us.

32:17.660 --> 32:19.330
With the humans?

32:19.380 --> 32:22.140
I suppose the Council authorized these negotiations.

32:22.140 --> 32:25.500
No one authorized the development of a bio-weapon,...

32:25.590 --> 32:28.240
but that didn't deter your colleagues from creating one.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.790
Undock from the human vessel immediately.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.370
He intends to seize the human vessel.

32:37.370 --> 32:40.270
He'll destroy both our ships if we don't comply.

32:47.700 --> 32:51.830
We don't stand a chance against them,
not in the shape we're in.

32:56.380 --> 32:58.120
What kind of weapons do you have?

32:58.120 --> 33:01.270
You expect me to attack a Reptilian warship?

33:01.270 --> 33:04.960
If we work together, we might be able to disable them.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.730
They're charging weapons.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.710
Are you familiar with the design of that ship?

33:13.770 --> 33:16.260
I did some work on their power systems.

33:16.370 --> 33:20.250
Then you know where they're vulnerable,
where to target our weapons.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.260
Their ship is heavily armored.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.030
At least we'd stand a chance.

33:24.030 --> 33:26.060
Those Reptilians are Xindi.

33:26.060 --> 33:29.790
You're asking me to attack my own people.

33:37.730 --> 33:39.910
Proceed to our starboard docking port.

33:39.910 --> 33:43.750
I want your word that
my crew won't be punished.

33:43.880 --> 33:47.750
You'll all be dealt with as the Council sees fit.

33:52.190 --> 33:54.350
He's nearly reached the Reptilians.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.360
He's knocked out their shield generators.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.360
Fire.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.380
Evasive maneuvers.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.420
Keep firing. Target their weapons.

34:26.219 --> 34:27.940
Their weapons are down.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.330
Degra was spot on.
He knew exactly where to hit them.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.650
Open a channel to Degra.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.770
- Sir!
- He's charging weapons.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.850
The Reptilian ship has been destroyed.

34:43.969 --> 34:46.320
Captain, Degra's hailing us.

34:51.480 --> 34:56.080
They would've contacted the Council
and exposed our alliance.

34:57.450 --> 34:59.080
I had no choice.

35:10.450 --> 35:12.980
Crewman Rostov said I'd find you here.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.980
Repair crews are starting tomorrow.

35:15.980 --> 35:18.030
I thought I'd try and get 'em some power.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.460
These assemblies are all fused together.

35:21.460 --> 35:24.460
I've spent the last hour trying
to isolate the damaged relays.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.460
You might find this useful.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.530
Portable power cells.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.380
Courtesy of our new Xindi friends?

35:35.720 --> 35:37.380
Damn neighborly of them.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.840
Is there anything I can help you with?

35:41.290 --> 35:43.840
Not unless you can resurrect the dead.

35:45.530 --> 35:47.960
Crewman Taylor had a real knack for this kind of thing.

35:49.470 --> 35:51.650
But Taylor's not here, is she?

35:52.480 --> 35:57.460
And neither is Crewman Kamata or Ensign Marcel...

35:57.460 --> 35:58.880
or a dozen others.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.270
So forgive me...

36:00.270 --> 36:04.320
if I don't want the damn power cells!

36:05.130 --> 36:08.400
We found Taylor over there outside her quarters.

36:09.290 --> 36:11.400
She was probably trying to get to her station.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.400
If she'd made it a few more meters, ..

36:15.150 --> 36:17.400
I wouldn't be trying to write this damn letter.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.400
Every time I start,...

36:20.710 --> 36:24.730
I hear myself saying what
a fine young woman she was, how...

36:24.730 --> 36:27.180
smart and full of potential...

36:31.270 --> 36:32.720
and I realize ...

36:33.640 --> 36:35.720
I'm not thinking about Taylor at all,...

36:39.210 --> 36:41.080
I'm thinking about Elizabeth.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.760
So many people dead...

36:47.820 --> 36:51.830
I tried not to see her any differently than
the other seven million.

36:54.030 --> 36:57.390
So I've spent the last nine months...

36:58.060 --> 37:02.410
trying to pretend she was just another victim.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.450
But she's my sister, T'Pol...

37:13.040 --> 37:14.830
my baby sister.

37:26.890 --> 37:29.050
I envy you Vulcans.

37:29.950 --> 37:32.740
You think that the loss of a colleague ...

37:33.590 --> 37:35.740
or friend doesn't affect us?

37:36.710 --> 37:37.730
It does.

37:39.140 --> 37:44.620
But if we give in to those emotions,
they overwhelm us.

37:49.070 --> 37:50.720
You're the ones to be envied.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.020
You need to speak to the Council.

38:07.610 --> 38:10.120
With the evidence you've shown me
they'll have no choice...

38:10.120 --> 38:11.790
but to take us seriously.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.810
Even the Reptilians?

38:17.910 --> 38:19.550
I'm more concerned about the Aquatics.

38:19.550 --> 38:21.450
They can be somewhat enigmatic.

38:21.450 --> 38:25.280
But if we can sway them,
we'll have a majority on our side.

38:33.190 --> 38:35.710
These are the coordinates for the Council chamber.

38:42.710 --> 38:45.430
This is nearly a dozen light years away.

38:45.750 --> 38:49.350
-It'll take us weeks to get there.
-There's a shorter route, a subspace corridor.

38:49.350 --> 38:52.200
It's located in a nebula less
than half a light year from here.

38:52.740 --> 38:56.020
That will show your helmsman how to get through it.

38:56.020 --> 38:58.310
I'll meet you at the far end in three days.

38:58.690 --> 39:01.310
Will it be soon enough to stop the weapon?

39:02.550 --> 39:05.040
I'll do everything I can to delay it.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.690
Use caution when you enter the nebula.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.880
A hostile species is known to prey
on ships that approach it.

39:19.310 --> 39:20.880
Thanks for the warning.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.920
See you in three days.

39:34.710 --> 39:36.920
Three days.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.240
Computer, begin recording.

39:57.450 --> 39:59.590
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor,...

40:00.880 --> 40:02.840
by the time you get this, ...

40:03.770 --> 40:05.910
Starfleet will have already told you about Jane.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.430
Since I worked so closely with her, ...

40:13.330 --> 40:15.380
I wanted to add my personal condolences.

40:20.130 --> 40:23.290
I have to confess,
I've been putting off writing this for a while.

40:25.370 --> 40:27.100
I convinced myself that...

40:27.630 --> 40:30.100
my duties on Enterprise took precedence.

40:33.910 --> 40:35.530
But the truth is...

40:38.080 --> 40:40.740
I didn't want to face the fact that someone so young, ...

40:42.350 --> 40:43.740
with so much promise...

40:47.540 --> 40:49.260
could just be gone.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.590
But I'm facing it now ...

40:57.600 --> 41:02.670
and I find myself thinking
how important she was to me.

41:05.970 --> 41:07.800
She was a great engineer...

41:10.040 --> 41:12.100
and she was my friend.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.830
She won't be forgotten.

41:35.670 --> 41:37.180
Good-bye, Elizabeth.

41:38.305 --> 41:44.319
