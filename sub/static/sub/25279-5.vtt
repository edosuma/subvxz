WEBVTT

00:07.340 --> 00:10.677
Dad, come on, we gotta go.
We've done everything we can.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.137
-Have we?
-Oh, come on, Dad,

00:12.220 --> 00:14.139
that's a trick question, all right?

00:14.222 --> 00:16.474
'Cause if we say yes,
then we're stupid for being wrong.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.602
If we say no, we're stupid
for not having done everything.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.856
Tell us what we're stupid for.
Let's get out of here!

00:24.065 --> 00:25.692
You didn't get all the ammo
out of the house.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.319
Dad, if we take the time
to do that,

00:28.403 --> 00:31.448
we won't die from the fire.
We'll die from old age.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.242
I'll get it myself.
Get out of here!

00:34.826 --> 00:37.078
-[Maggie] Hello?
-Mom?

00:37.162 --> 00:41.499
Wha... What are you doing?
You should've been at the school by now.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.543
How many times did she say that to us?

00:44.753 --> 00:48.256
Dad won't leave.
It's like when we go to Bass Pro Shops...

00:49.174 --> 00:51.384
or when Colt goes to fucking Sephora.

00:52.343 --> 00:54.179
They always have something new.

00:55.513 --> 00:59.309
You two, go. I got Hank out of the bar.
I can get Dad outta here.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.311
We won't leave without you guys.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.189
Colt Reagan! Jameson Ford!
You'll do as I say!

01:04.272 --> 01:06.191
Now get your asses the fuck out of here!

01:07.609 --> 01:10.278
-Yes, ma'am.
-Said that a lot too.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.115
Beau Roosevelt, get out here!

01:18.369 --> 01:21.623
Is that your mother's Bible?
That's sweet.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.083
It's her picture I was after.

01:24.709 --> 01:25.543
[Maggie] Ah.

01:26.503 --> 01:31.090
What, uh, book did you have it in? Judges?
'Cause that's all she ever did.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.343
I know you hated her.

01:33.426 --> 01:37.096
To be fair, she hated me.
I just hated her back.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.434
My dad took this picture of her
the day before he died.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.437
You got the photo.
It's time to go. Come on.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.814
Yeah.

01:45.897 --> 01:49.067
Beau, they're shutting down Highway 145.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.695
If we don't get out of here, we're
gonna be on the wrong side of this fire.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.573
How am I supposed to leave?

01:57.826 --> 02:00.411
I know there's
a lifetime of memories here, but...

02:01.996 --> 02:03.373
Yeah.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.251
Like the time Rooster put that sign
on the chimney that said,

02:06.334 --> 02:12.090
"Dear Santa, please leave the gifts
on the porch. Dad shoots trespassers."

02:13.049 --> 02:17.011
And you threw red food coloring
over the snow just to mess with him.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.431
He cried all night,
but he believed in Santa after that.

02:20.515 --> 02:24.936
What will you be? The idiot trying to
put out a wildfire with a garden hose?

02:25.019 --> 02:26.980
I don't expect you to understand.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.693
This ranch is part of me.
I can't just walk away.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.237
What's the worst that happens?

02:34.320 --> 02:36.656
It burns down and you rebuild.

02:36.739 --> 02:41.244
I'm 72 years old, Mags.
It's too late to start over.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.665
Look, if you wanna stay here
and go down with the ship, go ahead.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.878
I'll go to the school
and be with the rest of your family.

03:01.055 --> 03:02.265
Fuck!

03:25.038 --> 03:27.040
[theme song playing]

04:29.102 --> 04:32.772
This is crazy.
It's like the whole town's here.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.149
Yeah. It's terrible.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.821
Ah, look at that.
She got him out.

04:41.197 --> 04:46.661
-Oh, shit. Did you bring any condoms?
-I'm engaged to a pregnant woman.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.288
Okay.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.833
Worse comes to worst, I can
use a sandwich bag and a rubber band.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.003
Hey, Mom.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.381
Holy shit. Look at all this.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.592
It's unbelievable, everybody crammed in.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.680
Ironically, there's no way
this isn't a fire code violation.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.098
[chuckles]

05:07.181 --> 05:08.474
Hey, where's Abby?

05:08.558 --> 05:12.437
Oh, should be here soon.
She went to check up on her folks.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.273
I tried to call, but phone lines are down.

05:15.356 --> 05:19.819
Yeah. That or she realized she's
marrying you and drove into the fire.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.490
Who's in charge here?
It's a shitshow.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.244
Whoever it is, I have a feeling
there's about to be a regime change.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.665
I'm not trying to take over. I'm just
saying, nobody's signing anyone in,

05:32.749 --> 05:35.918
so how do we know who's here
and who's missing?

05:36.002 --> 05:39.297
And what good is a pallet of water
doing stacked in the corner?

05:39.380 --> 05:41.632
You know what? Fuck it.
I am in charge.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.679
-Let's get you settled in.
-I got it.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.142
Okay. Glad you're here, Dad.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.810
I'm not.

05:53.561 --> 05:57.398
I should be ensuring that
heavy equipment got moved to the pasture.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.275
Took care of everything, Dad.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.862
Kicked into leadership mode
and Colt was a good little worker bee.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.866
I also tore down some of the fence
on the east border.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.203
What?

06:11.746 --> 06:13.790
Why in the hell would you do that?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.458
Well, that was all Colt.

06:15.541 --> 06:19.253
Part of being a good leader is
giving credit where it's due.

06:19.337 --> 06:23.549
I did it in case the wind shifts, so the
cattle won't be trapped by the fire.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.803
I already cut it on the south side.
The downwind side.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.846
That's where those cows will go.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.225
If I wanted that other fence down,
I'd have cut it myself.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.311
Yeah and save every single cow
by yourself too, huh?

06:35.394 --> 06:37.688
That fence borders on the Hollister ranch.

06:38.564 --> 06:42.026
What you think'll happen when our
bulls get in with his registered cows?

06:42.819 --> 06:45.738
When will you stop doing dumb shit
behind my back?

06:45.822 --> 06:48.407
There's no chance
I'm not an idiot on this one?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.118
I can answer that for you.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.789
Even if that fire misses us,
that old man will have a fit.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.918
We're gonna have to gather cows,
separate cows.

06:59.001 --> 07:03.005
Run tests, give 'em shots...
We'll be lucky to avoid a fucking lawsuit.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.715
You're right. It was better

07:04.799 --> 07:07.260
if I let the cows burn to death
along the fence line.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.515
You know what?

07:12.598 --> 07:15.435
For somebody who
fucks things up all the time...

07:17.854 --> 07:20.857
you'd think
you'd start trusting my judgment.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.485
You always make things worse.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.993
Once again, I'm glad you're here, Dad.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.662
You know what?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.165
It doesn't matter.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.251
Do whatever in the hell you want.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.843
Hey, man, I had your back.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.102
-Hell, I was worried about you.
-I'm fine.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.729
I was talking to Drake.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.734
Man's best friend, meet man's worst.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.948
[groans] I saw Maggie and the boys.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.367
How's Joanne holding up?

08:13.951 --> 08:18.456
She's visiting her granddaughter for
her kindergarten orientation.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.417
It's a Montessori school,

08:21.501 --> 08:24.170
which probably means
you can't spank the kids.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.216
Orientation? What do they need to learn?

08:28.299 --> 08:31.511
Don't yell at each other and raise your
hand when you piss your pants?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.056
Same rules as a retirement home.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.518
Sleeping on a cot,

08:39.936 --> 08:41.812
whole life in a duffel bag,

08:42.396 --> 08:44.315
and no control over anything.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.402
I feel like I'm in Vietnam all over again.

08:49.570 --> 08:53.533
Well, here come the Viet Cong.
FEMA's showing up.

08:54.116 --> 08:58.788
Good Lord. As if we're not fucked enough,
now they're sending in the government.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.251
I don't know. Maybe this time,
they'll come in

09:03.334 --> 09:08.089
and help with the disaster relief and have
a positive impact on the community.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.093
[both laugh]

09:12.176 --> 09:15.137
I can't stand sitting around here
doing nothing.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.848
I hear you.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.017
Not too well, but I do hear ya.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.273
This place is a mess!
We're already losing water pressure.

09:25.356 --> 09:29.610
I don't think it's gonna last, even if
we do Rooster's group shower idea.

09:31.195 --> 09:34.115
Oh, Charlene said to say
prayer group is starting,

09:34.198 --> 09:36.117
and to make sure that
your hearing aid is on

09:36.200 --> 09:38.327
so you don't say amen three times
during the prayer.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.872
Oh, when the spirit moves me,
the spirit moves me.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.251
Long as it moves you away from me.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.798
Well, since I'm about to
go pray for forgiveness,

09:51.424 --> 09:52.842
you're an asshole.

09:56.512 --> 09:59.974
-So you won't be joining us?
-Amen.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.189
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.692
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.361
-Oh, hey, Colt.
-Hey, guys.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.947
Hey, where's, uh, where's Darlene?

10:15.573 --> 10:18.075
Oh, she took her kids
to her boyfriend's house.

10:18.159 --> 10:22.163
So if the fire gets too close,
they can hitch it up and drive away.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.707
Why don't we all just live in trailers?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.752
-[Mary chuckles]
-[Colt] Hell...

10:27.835 --> 10:29.754
So, how you guys holding up?

10:29.837 --> 10:32.757
All things considered, we're doing okay.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.801
We'd rather be safe in our own home,
but silver lining,

10:35.885 --> 10:38.971
handing out blankets counts toward
my community service.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.059
How you been?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.478
I've been good.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.689
Um, I've actually been taking some classes
to be a vet assistant.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.359
-What?
-Maybe even a vet someday.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.693
[Colt] Wow.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.946
-You'll be able to write prescriptions?
-Yeah.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.158
For animals, Colt.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.245
You never had a
horse tranquilizer and a Red Bull.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.956
I call it a Sleepy Bronco.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.543
It sounds like
it should be called a Cry for Help.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.671
How's everything else?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.717
It's good. Yeah.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.427
I've been busy.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.097
We bought that Peterson Ranch. And...

11:21.764 --> 11:24.183
Planning for the wedding.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.478
I'm up to 20 pull-ups now.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.233
How's Abby feeling?
She's gotta be pretty far along now.

11:33.984 --> 11:37.029
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that... That's, uh...

11:38.656 --> 11:39.698
Abby's pregnant...

11:40.908 --> 11:42.827
which you already knew.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.621
And obviously, I didn't tell you 'cause...

11:47.665 --> 11:50.209
[stammers] I mentioned
I'm up to like 20 pull-ups now.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.127
[Heather chuckles]

11:52.044 --> 11:53.254
It's okay, Colt.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.506
I'm happy for you and Abby.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.801
In fact, um, I brought you something.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.054
Is it my Kacey Musgraves CD?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.849
'Cause I was wondering
if you was giving that back.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.352
Whoa.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.395
Yeah, um...

12:10.688 --> 12:15.401
When we had to evacuate, I was looking
for things to take and I saw this guy.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.613
-You and Abby should have him.
-Thank you.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.410
It's got my initials carved into it.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.705
Still got the bullet hole

12:27.788 --> 12:30.791
where Rooster said it came up lame
and had to put it down.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.462
Jesus, boys are fucked up.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.591
Yeah, we never met a doll or a fish that
we didn't wanna put a firecracker in.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.221
Thank you.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.517
It was good to see you, Colt.

12:51.061 --> 12:54.398
-You too, stranger.
-[chuckles]

12:56.984 --> 12:58.360
Hey, by the way,

12:58.903 --> 13:02.031
if you and Abby ever disagree
on a parenting decision,

13:02.865 --> 13:04.158
I agree with Abby.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.494
Yeah. I heard that a lot.

13:10.247 --> 13:14.627
Oh, hey, Mr. Philips, Mrs. Phillips.
I'm glad you guys are safe.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.212
Yeah, we're fine.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.172
That's enough small talk.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.759
I see the Hendersons have
staked out the best cot location.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.094
Where's Abby?

13:24.178 --> 13:27.848
I wanna talk about my day
and Chuck won't do it with me.

13:28.557 --> 13:32.394
What are you talking about? She went
to your house to help you guys out.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.981
We haven't seen her since
we dropped you off last night.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.946
And you told me it was unethical to put a
GPS tracker on her, but here we are.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.449
Shit. Phones are still down.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.995
I'm sure she's fine,
but I'll go look for her.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.830
I'm going with you.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.290
No. You don't have to.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.710
Colt, this is my daughter.
I wanna make sure she's okay too.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.047
Oh, hi. I didn't get a chance
to meet you two last night.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.507
It's still not a good time, Hank!

14:02.216 --> 14:04.552
You just let me know when it is.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.853
[sighs] Hey, Mary. You cold?
Want a blanket?

14:15.437 --> 14:17.982
Uh, no, but judging from your nipples,
you might want one.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.320
Hey. My eyes are up here, all right?
Not a piece of meat.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.741
-Unless you're hungry.
-[laughs] No, I just ate.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.951
[Rooster chuckles]

14:29.493 --> 14:31.328
-How you doing?
-Oh, I'm okay.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.747
-Trying to keep my mind off all this.
-Yeah.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.749
My insurance company's been
screwing me for years,

14:35.833 --> 14:38.627
so I'm putting in a claim for
the fur coat, diamond earrings

14:38.711 --> 14:40.546
and Ferrari I lost in the fire.

14:40.629 --> 14:41.714
[both chuckle]

14:41.797 --> 14:43.215
That is badass.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.050
Don't forget I parked my Harley
in your garage.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.803
Aw, you just said,
"Parked your Harley in my garage,"

14:47.887 --> 14:49.096
and did not make a sex joke.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.515
Yeah, well, I'm maturin'. You know?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.851
You wanna fuck in the janitor's closet?

14:55.436 --> 14:58.397
Babe, I got us waters.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.481
Thanks, boo.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.985
This is my boyfriend, Nick.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.403
Oh. Shit.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.529
[chuckles]

15:05.613 --> 15:07.740
Hey. Nice to meet ya.
How you doin'?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.283
Soft hands.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.702
No beard? You got a desk job?

15:12.870 --> 15:16.290
Sort of. I worked in the library
while I was in prison.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.834
Library? Nerd.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.754
[chuckles] Nah, I'm just kidding.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.048
Nice to meet you.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.510
You too. Uh, you mind if I get in here?

15:28.594 --> 15:32.890
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Didn't mean to cot-block ya. [chuckles]

15:41.523 --> 15:43.275
Okay, Rooster, we'll...
We'll see you around.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.818
Yeah, yeah.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.236
Catch you guys later.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.989
I'm gonna go practice
my Brazilian jujitsu.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.076
Do you know what belt comes after black?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.535
I'll figure it out.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.254
Got a lot of empty beer cans
in the back of your truck.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.340
Oh.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.594
Yeah. I pick 'em up off the roadside.

16:11.595 --> 16:15.140
Recycle 'em. I care about the community.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.062
You only pick up Coors Light tallboys?

16:22.439 --> 16:23.482
Oh!

16:24.692 --> 16:27.361
It's the brand most litterers prefer, huh?
[laughs nervously]

16:30.114 --> 16:33.367
[sighs] I shouldn't have
let Abby go by herself.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.077
No shit.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.748
Even if you had tried,
you wouldn't have been able to stop her.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.544
Abby's a strong-willed girl.
You can't change her mind.

16:43.627 --> 16:44.461
[Colt chuckles softly]

16:44.545 --> 16:47.756
If you could, I'd be sitting here
with somebody else.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.510
Oh, she'll be okay, though.
She's tough.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.680
We binge-watched
four episodes of <i>This is Us.</i>

16:54.763 --> 16:56.682
She didn't cry. Not once.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.564
I'm sorry about postponing that wedding.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.358
We don't have to talk about it now.

17:07.234 --> 17:11.238
Yeah, well. We don't get to talk,
just you and I, very often.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.948
I think that's by design.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.287
I'm sorry about the wedding.
And I'm sorry about the job offer.

17:18.370 --> 17:22.124
Oh, and I'm sorry about using
your NFL Sunday ticket log-in.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.210
Is that why I can't watch?

17:25.294 --> 17:28.422
Do you know how many hours I spent
yelling at customer service?

17:28.505 --> 17:30.758
I made that poor Indian man cry.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.261
-Bill from Omaha, my ass.
-[Colt chuckles]

17:39.767 --> 17:41.560
Maybe I've been tough on you.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.939
But if you have a daughter,
you'll understand.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.692
If I have a daughter,
she's gonna be a gay nun.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.902
[chuckles]

17:51.111 --> 17:52.196
[can opens]

17:58.202 --> 18:01.455
Oh, can you believe someone left
a full one in the ditch? [chuckles]

18:05.501 --> 18:07.544
Must've been a cold ditch.

18:15.177 --> 18:21.141
So, how's everything with the ranches?
Ever able to pull together any money?

18:22.142 --> 18:24.937
Yeah, yeah, we pieced something together.

18:26.396 --> 18:29.358
Depending on this fire, we should be able
to get the cattle to market.

18:31.193 --> 18:35.989
Janice tried to talk me into
giving you a loan, but I'm sorry,

18:36.073 --> 18:39.910
I still think it's just throwing
good money after bad.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.913
Yeah, no, I get it.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.500
In fact, we don't ever
have to talk about that again.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.636
[grunts] I don't even know
how you drink this stuff.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.637
I don't even like beer.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.020
Still got it.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.482
Have you seen Colt?

19:10.566 --> 19:13.152
Oh, he and Chuck went to get Abby.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.654
Why the hell
doesn't anybody tell me anything?

19:15.737 --> 19:19.158
It's a mystery.
You seem so approachable.

19:20.993 --> 19:25.122
So now that you prayed,
is it safe to assume the fire's out?

19:25.205 --> 19:29.459
Now you can joke if you want to,
but you did miss a great prayer circle.

19:29.543 --> 19:33.255
We didn't have any communion wafers,
so we used Oreos.

19:33.922 --> 19:37.176
Turns out the body of Christ
was double stuffed.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.139
Dear Lord, can you please make
Dale go away?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.517
Behold the power of prayer.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.148
I get you didn't wanna go
to prayer circle,

19:51.231 --> 19:53.317
but don't make fun of people who did.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.570
I always make fun of Dale.
That's the way we communicate.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.781
I don't get it.
You used to like to go to church.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.369
Well, things change.
Now, the ranch is my church.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.371
It doesn't have to be one or the other.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.624
Look, Maggie, I've prayed.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.920
And all it got me was a divorce,
a heart attack,

20:13.545 --> 20:15.714
and a ranch that's running on fumes.

20:16.757 --> 20:21.678
Oh, yeah. There's a wildfire that's
about to wipe out the whole fucking town.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.977
I know our life hasn't been perfect,
but we have a lot to be thankful for.

20:29.061 --> 20:33.023
We have two sons,
we have a grandkid on the way,

20:33.607 --> 20:36.735
and there's a gym full of people
who are safe from that wildfire.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.987
You're right.

20:39.071 --> 20:43.033
And that's all because you held hands
and had a chit-chat with God.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.828
Look, I'm just saying that

20:46.912 --> 20:50.916
I prayed for Colt when he got pneumonia
when was a baby and he got better.

20:51.708 --> 20:55.963
And then I prayed that you would come home
safe from Vietnam and you did.

20:56.046 --> 21:00.717
And I said that same prayer again when
you had a heart attack and here you are.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.596
Still alive, still a pain in the ass.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.768
-All that would've happened anyway.
-You don't know that.

21:09.851 --> 21:14.106
Look, Maggie, if you wanna pray, go pray.
But leave me out of it.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.733
-I just think it would help you--
-What don't you get?

21:17.567 --> 21:19.987
I don't want any fucking help!

21:21.613 --> 21:25.033
God. Maybe you should've
stayed at the ranch.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.502
Hey, we should talk about Nick.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.839
Yeah. [sighs]

21:40.757 --> 21:45.220
You worried prison turned him?
'Cause that happens. Kinda got that vibe.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.555
[chuckles condescendingly]

21:46.638 --> 21:51.018
No. Um, Nick's not just my boyfriend.
He's actually my ex-husband.

21:51.101 --> 21:54.271
Oh, first ex-husband. And third.

21:54.354 --> 21:58.317
And he's Darlene's dad. Pretty sure.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.069
Oh, shit. That Nick?

22:01.153 --> 22:04.489
He sent Darlene a carton of Newports
for her eighth birthday, right?

22:05.657 --> 22:09.036
In his defense, in prison money,
that's like buying her a pony.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.662
[chuckles]

22:10.746 --> 22:14.916
It may sound crazy, but, um,
he's worked hard to turn his life around.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.961
Yeah, well, look.
I don't need to get in the way.

22:18.045 --> 22:22.549
I'm just the hot piece of ass on the side.
Nothing's gotta change.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.595
Yeah. Actually, it does.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.601
Okay. Well, I am open-minded,

22:32.684 --> 22:36.730
but I'm not doing nothing where me
and Nick are, you know, double parking.

22:37.439 --> 22:41.234
It's nice to know you have boundaries.
[chuckles]

22:41.318 --> 22:43.028
You and I, we have to stop this. Okay?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.989
Seriously, I wanna give
me and Nick a real shot.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.908
Yeah. Sure. No problem.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.409
Thank you for understanding.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.952
Yeah. Of course.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.996
Look, man, whatever you need.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.167
Hey, um, you wanna go fuck
in the janitor's closet?

23:00.337 --> 23:02.547
What the hell? Shit.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.383
Hope it's not a DUI checkpoint.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.928
We can't turn around.
They check for that.

23:10.097 --> 23:15.435
All right. Oh, Wilkerson. What's going on?

23:15.519 --> 23:19.731
Road's closed. Fire jumped Highway 145.
You guys gotta turn around.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.360
We gotta get through.
My daughter's on the other side.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.196
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry. I can't do it.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.448
The firemen went door to door.
I'm sure they found her.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.493
Don't be a dick, Wilkerson.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.746
I'm not being a dick.
I'm doing my job, all right, Bennett?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.749
[scoffs] Like you was
doing your job after practice

23:37.833 --> 23:39.251
when you used to shower
in your underwears?

23:39.334 --> 23:40.752
Hey, fuck you, man!

23:40.836 --> 23:43.672
-Fuck you, Captain Underwears!
-Okay. Calm down.

23:43.755 --> 23:44.881
Sorry, sir.

23:44.965 --> 23:48.426
If you hear anything about Abby,
we'll be at the school.

23:49.052 --> 23:50.637
I'll let you know.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.941
Sorry about that.
It's just that I hate that guy.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.569
Don't apologize. He's a little prick.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.824
What do we do now?
Turn around and head back to the school?

24:10.907 --> 24:13.410
No! Drive through that fucking roadblock!

24:15.370 --> 24:16.621
Yes, sir.

24:25.338 --> 24:29.718
-Mind if I sit?
-Of course not. Heard anything?

24:29.801 --> 24:33.889
Oh, I heard the Hendersons used up
the hot water in the showers.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.682
I fucking hate them.

24:37.851 --> 24:41.188
-How you holding up?
-Honestly, not great.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.150
All I keep thinking about is "what if?"

24:46.610 --> 24:51.323
Oh, trust me, I keep running these
scenarios in my head

24:52.282 --> 24:55.118
and you know what?
We just have to stay positive.

24:56.536 --> 24:59.331
I've been distracting myself
with a little game.

24:59.414 --> 25:03.335
Every time I take a sip of wine,
I have to take a sip of wine.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.589
Oh, my turn.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.718
Looks like fun.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.511
You said fun. You have to drink.

25:13.595 --> 25:14.679
[chuckles]

25:17.182 --> 25:18.225
Hey, Billy.

25:19.267 --> 25:22.062
What's up, Beer Pong?
You looking for this?

25:22.145 --> 25:23.230
Damn it!

25:24.814 --> 25:27.734
-Hey, Billy. Any news?
-Yeah, it's why I'm here.

25:28.401 --> 25:31.988
Colt and Mr. Phillips broke through
a roadblock and drove into the fire zone.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.866
-What?
-Was Abby with them?

25:34.950 --> 25:38.203
-No, they're still looking for her.
-Oh, my God.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.705
-I'll go look for them.
-I'll go with you.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.041
Hold on. Colt and Abby
are two of my best friends.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.669
If there was anything that could've
been done, I'd have done it already.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.587
I don't care. We're going.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.590
Look, you can leave,
but whatever direction you go,

25:50.674 --> 25:52.342
you're going to run into
a big wall of fire

25:52.425 --> 25:54.511
and end up right back here.
If you're lucky.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.146
[Colt] Is that Abby's truck?

26:08.525 --> 26:09.943
Is she in there?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.367
Abby!

26:37.220 --> 26:38.763
[sighs]
