00:12.821 --> 00:16.321
Sir, we just found this among
Meredith Reed's personal effects.

00:16.354 --> 00:18.354
It's a dedicated key card,
United Nations issue.

00:18.388 --> 00:20.821
To who? President Hassan and his family.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.688
It accesses their private residence.

00:22.721 --> 00:24.554
<i> We got her.</i>

00:24.588 --> 00:26.154
I want to know where you got it.

00:26.187 --> 00:28.721
Omar gave it to me.

00:28.755 --> 00:32.755
I gave Miss Reed this key card for
reasons I'm sure are clear to you.

00:32.788 --> 00:35.054
<i>Sir, are you confirming</i>

00:35.087 --> 00:37.054
a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?

00:37.087 --> 00:39.688
I trust your complete
discretion in this matter.

00:39.721 --> 00:41.521
We have a problem.

00:41.554 --> 00:42.855
My brother confessed to the affair.

00:42.887 --> 00:44.788
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.

00:44.821 --> 00:47.121
<i> There is no reason to diverge</i>

00:47.154 --> 00:47.954
from the plan.

00:47.987 --> 00:49.020
How much longer?

00:49.054 --> 00:50.221
Your brother will be dead

00:50.254 --> 00:52.287
before the hour is out.

00:52.321 --> 00:54.821
What are you doing here?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.721
I thought I told you to leave me alone.

00:56.755 --> 00:59.087
<i>CTU.</i>

00:59.121 --> 01:01.121
Senior Data Analyst.

01:01.154 --> 01:03.354
Well, sounds like an important job.

01:03.388 --> 01:05.254
Damn it, what do you want from me?!

01:05.287 --> 01:06.588
A place to crash, for starters.

01:06.621 --> 01:07.755
You can stay the night.

01:07.788 --> 01:09.920
I want you out tomorrow.

01:09.954 --> 01:12.154
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're evacuating immediately,

01:12.187 --> 01:14.388
due to a possible bomb threat.

01:14.421 --> 01:16.621
<i>Madam President,
you and Secretary Kanin</i>

01:16.654 --> 01:17.755
need to move now.

01:17.788 --> 01:19.588
President Hassan, if you'll follow me.

01:23.987 --> 01:24.821
Yes?

01:24.855 --> 01:26.287
He's in the third car.

01:26.321 --> 01:28.388
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now.

01:29.621 --> 01:31.388
Officer, this is going down now.

01:31.421 --> 01:33.588
You can either stand here and do nothing

01:33.621 --> 01:35.054
or you can help me stop it.

01:35.087 --> 01:37.087
Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now.

01:37.121 --> 01:38.721
The assassin is part of
the evacuation detail.

01:38.755 --> 01:40.388
There is no bomb in the UN.

01:40.421 --> 01:43.488
It's too late-- Hassan's
car just exited the tunnel.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.654
Cole, you need to stop that car,
or Hassan's a dead man.

01:55.721 --> 01:57.154
Cole!

01:57.187 --> 01:58.788
What was that?! What happened?

02:15.321 --> 02:16.755
This is a damn disaster, Brian.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.454
What do you mean,
you don't know what happened?

02:18.488 --> 02:19.954
How is Hassan? Is he all right?

02:19.987 --> 02:21.154
We don't know yet, Madam President.

02:21.187 --> 02:22.987
It appears the bomb threat at the UN

02:23.020 --> 02:25.121
was a hoax designed to get
him out of the building.

02:25.154 --> 02:26.488
"It appears"?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.887
An IED was planted on
Hassan's evacuation route.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.887
And you drove him right into it!

02:30.920 --> 02:32.954
One of our agents detected the ambush,

02:32.987 --> 02:35.154
tried to head him off
just as the bomb exploded.

02:35.187 --> 02:37.121
Well, you better pray he got there in time.

02:52.187 --> 02:54.421
Security there! Now!

02:59.454 --> 03:01.254
Stand down! I'm with CTU.

03:06.521 --> 03:09.254
Sir, we need to move you
to another vehicle. Now.

03:09.287 --> 03:11.521
Sir, you do not want to stay here.

03:22.254 --> 03:24.187
Go, go, go.

03:25.987 --> 03:28.621
Move! Move!

03:40.421 --> 03:41.388
Cole?

03:41.421 --> 03:42.388
Yeah.

03:42.421 --> 03:43.821
Thank God you're okay.

03:43.855 --> 03:45.254
I got lucky.

03:45.287 --> 03:47.020
Hassan escaped the blast; he's fine.

03:47.054 --> 03:48.688
He's heading toward CTU,

03:48.721 --> 03:51.721
eastbound on 48th Street
in a black SUV. Got him.

03:51.755 --> 03:53.054
Mr. Hastings, here.

03:53.087 --> 03:54.887
Hassan, he's safe.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.920
Dana, the assassin was posing
as a part of the security team.

03:57.954 --> 03:59.521
I know-- we got the info from Chloe.

03:59.554 --> 04:01.388
The police are putting up a thre
e-bock cordon now.

04:02.821 --> 04:04.788
Cole?

04:04.821 --> 04:07.654
Cole? Cole, are you there?

04:07.688 --> 04:09.887
I've got the suspect-
he's dressed as a cop.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.221
Entering a white low-rise

04:11.254 --> 04:12.488
north of the UN.

04:12.521 --> 04:13.920
Call it in! I'm in pursuit!

04:13.954 --> 04:15.887
Chloe, I need to put out a priority APB.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.154
Move, move, move!

04:47.887 --> 04:48.920
What is it now?

04:48.954 --> 04:50.788
They've got a lead on the assassin.

04:50.821 --> 04:52.121
4722 East 47th Street.

04:52.154 --> 04:53.688
I'm gonna need my weapon.

04:53.721 --> 04:55.388
Your bag's right behind my seat.

04:58.821 --> 05:01.154
East 47th Street-- that's just above the UN.

05:01.187 --> 05:03.287
You're gonna need to turn now.

05:03.321 --> 05:04.187
Now! Now!

05:10.421 --> 05:11.488
UN Four, come in.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.521
UN Four, this is CTU Two. Come in, please.

05:14.554 --> 05:17.521
I'm sorry, I can't reach him. Try again.

05:17.554 --> 05:20.887
That's my husband in that car up there.
They're not answering.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.855
I have to go to him. Dalia! Ma'am,
please, you need to remain in the car.

05:23.887 --> 05:25.621
Stay calm.

05:25.654 --> 05:27.221
I'll try another number.

05:30.954 --> 05:32.621
Where are you?

05:32.654 --> 05:34.054
Yes, we're safe.

05:34.087 --> 05:35.621
Dalia, Kayla and myself.

05:35.654 --> 05:38.621
I need to know about my brother.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.154
He's alive.

05:40.187 --> 05:42.920
He survived.

05:42.954 --> 05:45.087
Farhad, how is he?

05:45.121 --> 05:47.421
He's alive.

05:49.187 --> 05:50.321
God is with us.

05:52.788 --> 05:55.154
Can you tell me what happened?

05:58.254 --> 06:02.887
A car in the motorcade
swerved in front of him.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.920
They're locking down the entire area.

06:04.954 --> 06:07.755
What would you suggest we do?

06:07.788 --> 06:10.354
It's over.

06:10.388 --> 06:12.054
Get out now.

06:12.087 --> 06:16.521
It can't be long before
they realize it's you.

06:19.954 --> 06:21.421
Farhad?

06:23.788 --> 06:25.987
Sir, please stay in the car!

06:26.020 --> 06:28.020
Please, sir.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.621
Sir, I need you to get back in the car.

06:39.454 --> 06:40.521
Oh!

07:18.488 --> 07:20.454
Get on your knees.

07:21.954 --> 07:24.887
Slide your weapon back to me.

07:24.920 --> 07:25.954
Slowly...

07:25.987 --> 07:27.521
slow...

07:29.054 --> 07:33.788
Now... you're going to walk me out of here.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.621
Call in.

07:35.654 --> 07:38.887
Say the southwest corner is clear.

07:38.920 --> 07:43.621
Tell them to move the search
team to the northeast.

07:43.654 --> 07:45.588
Do it.

07:45.621 --> 07:47.855
You want to live?

07:47.887 --> 07:50.087
Make the call.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.755
This is Cole Ortiz

07:58.788 --> 08:00.721
in the southwest corner of the building.

08:00.755 --> 08:03.654
I'm in pursuit of the assassin.

08:12.254 --> 08:14.054
He's with me now.

08:15.821 --> 08:17.954
You okay?

08:17.987 --> 08:18.954
You okay?

08:18.987 --> 08:20.887
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.721
Okay.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.688
Son of a bitch.

08:53.421 --> 08:55.721
Mr. President, Brian Hastings.

08:55.755 --> 08:57.454
We spoke on the phone.

08:57.488 --> 08:59.521
We're glad you're here. Please follow me.

09:03.788 --> 09:05.454
Is my family here?

09:05.488 --> 09:07.454
No, sir. We'll try and get

09:07.488 --> 09:09.254
you all together shortly.
Are they all right?

09:09.287 --> 09:11.020
Your wife and daughter are fine.

09:11.054 --> 09:12.421
And my brother?

09:14.321 --> 09:16.087
Was he hurt?

09:16.121 --> 09:18.087
No, sir.

09:18.121 --> 09:19.954
Mr. President...

09:21.221 --> 09:24.788
It appears your brother was
involved with the attack.

09:24.821 --> 09:26.554
My brother?

09:26.588 --> 09:27.920
Yes, sir.

09:27.954 --> 09:29.755
That can't be right.

09:29.788 --> 09:31.887
Bring him to me. I need to talk to him.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.755
Unfortunately, we don't know
where he is at the moment.

09:34.788 --> 09:37.654
Then how can you be sure it was him?

09:37.688 --> 09:39.755
Mr. President, after the explosion,

09:39.788 --> 09:43.321
he killed one of my men to
facilitate his own escape.

09:43.354 --> 09:47.054
There were witnesses,
including your wife and daughter.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.221
He's the insider we've been looking for.

09:49.254 --> 09:52.154
There's no doubt.

09:52.187 --> 09:53.721
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry for interrupting.

09:53.755 --> 09:55.321
You asked for any updates
about the assassin.

09:55.354 --> 09:56.755
And?

09:56.788 --> 09:59.421
He's dead. Jack just called it in.

09:59.454 --> 10:01.388
He uplinked some video
footage that you need to see.

10:01.421 --> 10:03.454
I'll be there in a minute.

10:03.488 --> 10:05.121
Don't let me keep you from your job.

10:05.154 --> 10:06.688
Thank you, sir.

10:06.721 --> 10:08.154
No, thank you. I owe you my life.

10:09.221 --> 10:10.821
Conference room.

10:10.855 --> 10:11.954
Uh, Mr. Hastings, uh...

10:11.987 --> 10:13.354
Meredith Reed,

10:13.388 --> 10:16.521
the woman you brought here for
questioning, where is she?

10:16.554 --> 10:17.887
Still here.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.954
Looks like she'll be
cleared of any wrongdoing.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.721
I'd like to talk to her.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.287
I'll arrange it.

10:23.321 --> 10:24.354
Thank you.

10:24.388 --> 10:25.987
Excuse me.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.654
I saw that. What?

10:28.688 --> 10:31.621
The way you looked at me when he
thanked me for saving his life.

10:31.654 --> 10:33.521
You think he should have been thanking you?

10:33.554 --> 10:36.020
I was actually thinking
he should thank Jack,

10:36.054 --> 10:38.454
then Cole, then maybe me.

10:45.488 --> 10:47.755
I underestimated you, Chloe.

10:47.788 --> 10:50.688
You saw what was really going on; I did not.

10:50.721 --> 10:52.755
It was a major save.

10:52.788 --> 10:54.421
And my report will state that.

11:04.521 --> 11:06.855
Chloe said you have some video to show me.

11:06.887 --> 11:07.821
Yes, sir. Take a look.

11:07.855 --> 11:09.321
These are images uplinked

11:09.354 --> 11:10.321
by Jack Bauer

11:10.354 --> 11:11.621
from the bomb site.

11:11.654 --> 11:13.421
It's the assassin who was targeting Hassan.

11:13.454 --> 11:15.354
We have an ID? Not yet.

11:15.388 --> 11:18.221
But I believe we do have a workable lead.

11:18.254 --> 11:20.354
These are tattoos off the
two men who attempted

11:20.388 --> 11:22.121
to take out our informant this afternoon.

11:22.154 --> 11:23.688
Same as the assassin.

11:23.721 --> 11:25.121
We believe they indicate membership

11:25.154 --> 11:26.788
in a particular Russian crime syndicate.

11:26.821 --> 11:28.588
What's a Russian gang have against

11:28.621 --> 11:30.087
the leader of the Islamic Republic?

11:30.121 --> 11:31.388
I don't know.

11:31.421 --> 11:33.254
Could just be hired muscle.

11:33.287 --> 11:35.221
But when the photos arrived,
I ran them by the FBI.

11:35.254 --> 11:37.421
Turns out, they had an agent
undercover working with

11:37.454 --> 11:39.388
the Russian mob here several years ago.

11:39.421 --> 11:41.087
A woman. Contact her.

11:41.121 --> 11:43.755
Already done. I have a
helicopter bringing her in now.

11:43.788 --> 11:45.987
Chloe, I think you worked with her.

11:46.020 --> 11:47.654
Renee Walker.

11:47.688 --> 11:50.454
Says here she's no longer with the FBI.

11:50.488 --> 11:51.488
It's true.

11:51.521 --> 11:52.788
She resigned over an internal dispute.

11:52.821 --> 11:54.321
Meaning she was fired

11:54.354 --> 11:55.354
and her records have been sealed.

11:56.388 --> 11:58.321
What are we getting into here?

11:58.354 --> 12:00.321
Sir, we are only using her to brief us.

12:00.354 --> 12:01.788
These Russian groups are secretive

12:01.821 --> 12:03.054
to the point of paranoia.

12:03.087 --> 12:04.087
She's the only one

12:04.121 --> 12:05.721
who ever got close.

12:14.154 --> 12:17.121
President Omar Hassan was
not harmed in the attack,

12:17.154 --> 12:19.821
and has since been taken
to a secure location.

12:19.855 --> 12:22.654
Confirmed fatalities now stand at three...

12:23.788 --> 12:25.755
...including a police officer.

12:29.187 --> 12:30.588
Yes?

12:30.621 --> 12:32.588
Why is my brother still alive?

12:32.621 --> 12:34.321
You're upset, Farhad.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.321
Justifiably.

12:35.354 --> 12:36.588
Your man failed!

12:36.621 --> 12:38.554
Once you have the materials
in your possession,

12:38.588 --> 12:40.287
your brother, his peace conference,

12:40.321 --> 12:41.654
none of that matters.

12:41.688 --> 12:43.087
Isn't that what you told me?

12:43.121 --> 12:46.087
All you have to do is stay
calm and stick to your plan.

12:48.054 --> 12:50.621
Or should I be looking for another buyer?

12:50.654 --> 12:52.688
I'll be there soon.

12:52.721 --> 12:53.954
Good.

12:53.987 --> 12:55.688
We'll have a nice meal waiting.

12:55.721 --> 12:57.020
And we'll talk.

13:19.478 --> 13:21.911
I've been informed that the
bomb threat was a hoax.

13:21.945 --> 13:23.211
That's confirmed, Madam President.

13:23.244 --> 13:25.744
We've swept the negotiating
chamber with sniffer dogs

13:25.778 --> 13:27.444
and ground- penetrating radar.

13:27.478 --> 13:29.444
I can assure you, it's safe.

13:29.478 --> 13:32.211
I'm glad to hear it.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.744
Hassan is standing by at CTU.

13:33.778 --> 13:34.811
How is he, Rob?

13:34.845 --> 13:36.177
Well, he narrowly escaped

13:36.211 --> 13:38.778
being blown to pieces by his
own brother, so not too well.

13:41.311 --> 13:44.411
But your call to him can't just
be all sympathy and concern.

13:44.444 --> 13:47.077
We need to know where he stands vi
s-ÃƒÂ -vis the talks.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.411
It's hardly the time.

13:48.444 --> 13:49.578
No, it's exactly the time.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.144
The signing is scheduled for tomorrow.

13:51.177 --> 13:53.644
Dozens of world leaders are
already en route to New York.

13:53.678 --> 13:56.244
We need to know if we still
have a peace process.

13:59.277 --> 14:00.945
Put him on.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.044
Sir,

14:05.077 --> 14:07.578
I have President Taylor for you.

14:07.611 --> 14:08.911
Madam President.

14:08.945 --> 14:10.110
I cannot begin

14:10.144 --> 14:11.778
to say how relieved I am

14:11.811 --> 14:13.945
that you survived this
terrible attack, Omar.

14:13.977 --> 14:15.277
Thank you.

14:15.311 --> 14:18.478
I'm mortified that this
outrage happened on U.S. soil.

14:19.878 --> 14:22.744
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.344
My brother, Farhad, did this.

14:24.377 --> 14:28.344
He betrayed me, and worse,
he put you in harm's way.

14:28.377 --> 14:31.411
I should have realized what he's up to.

14:31.444 --> 14:34.344
We can only be betrayed
by the people we trust.

14:34.377 --> 14:36.644
He fooled all of us.

14:36.678 --> 14:39.945
Sir, this is Rob Weiss.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.678
You've heard Farhad escaped.

14:41.711 --> 14:44.010
Can I ask what you think
his agenda might be,

14:44.044 --> 14:46.578
aside from targeting you?

14:46.611 --> 14:50.044
Uh, w-what I mean, sir,
is... does he have a plan?

14:50.077 --> 14:51.711
Yes, he has a plan.

14:51.744 --> 14:53.744
Regime change.

14:53.778 --> 14:55.478
Isn't that what you Americans call it?

14:55.511 --> 14:58.077
Mr. President, we're doing everything we can

14:58.110 --> 14:59.444
to apprehend Farhad,

14:59.478 --> 15:02.377
but while he's at large, I'd understand it

15:02.411 --> 15:05.010
if you wished not to continue the talks.

15:05.044 --> 15:09.678
However, I hope that I can
persuade you to reconvene.

15:09.711 --> 15:13.077
We have come so far together.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.811
And to let this moment slip...

15:14.845 --> 15:17.411
Would be to hand Farhad victory.

15:17.444 --> 15:20.311
I will not give him this satisfaction.

15:20.344 --> 15:24.544
If you are willing to continue
with these talks, so am I.

15:24.578 --> 15:27.578
I am delighted to hear it.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.344
Uh, if you could persuade

15:31.377 --> 15:33.578
Mr. Hastings here to release me.

15:33.611 --> 15:35.044
We'll coordinate with CTU

15:35.077 --> 15:37.644
so that you can return to
the UN as soon as possible.

15:37.678 --> 15:40.344
I-I know that you want to be
with your wife and daughter.

15:40.377 --> 15:41.344
Thank you.

15:41.377 --> 15:42.644
Thank you, Madam President.

15:49.911 --> 15:51.845
You want your office back, Mr. Hastings.

15:51.878 --> 15:53.077
It's fine, sir.

15:53.110 --> 15:55.511
Can I ask what you and
President Taylor agreed?

15:55.544 --> 15:57.911
That I should return to
UN as soon as possible.

15:57.945 --> 15:58.911
We'll make the arrangements.

15:58.945 --> 16:00.077
Uh, before I leave,

16:00.110 --> 16:01.077
I would like to thank

16:01.110 --> 16:02.411
the young man who saved my life.

16:02.444 --> 16:04.478
That would be Agent Ortiz.

16:04.511 --> 16:06.010
He's returning to CTU right now.

16:19.110 --> 16:20.678
You really should go to Medical.

16:20.711 --> 16:21.711
Yeah.

16:21.744 --> 16:23.144
Soon as I hand the body over to Forensics.

16:23.177 --> 16:24.544
What are you going to do?

16:24.578 --> 16:26.411
Finish my debrief, try and catch
that last flight to Los Angeles.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.110
Thanks, Jack. It's been an honor.

16:28.144 --> 16:30.144
Take care of yourself, okay?

16:32.077 --> 16:33.244
Hey.

16:33.277 --> 16:34.311
I'm glad you're okay.

16:34.344 --> 16:35.678
Thanks. Me, too.

16:35.711 --> 16:37.945
We ID'd the assassin
using your video footage.

16:37.977 --> 16:39.277
We think he was working for

16:39.311 --> 16:41.044
one of the Russian crime syndicates here.

16:41.077 --> 16:42.177
Any idea which one?

16:42.211 --> 16:43.344
Not yet.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.945
But we're bringing in someone to brief us.

16:44.977 --> 16:46.411
Good.

16:46.444 --> 16:49.110
Jack, it's Renee.

16:49.144 --> 16:51.478
What?

16:51.511 --> 16:52.845
Why?

16:52.878 --> 16:55.177
Six years ago, she worked
undercover with the Russian mob.

16:55.211 --> 16:57.644
FBI says she's still one of
the best experts they have.

16:57.678 --> 16:59.911
Have you spoken to her?

16:59.945 --> 17:01.411
No.

17:01.444 --> 17:04.010
I tried phoning her a few times,
she never returned my calls.

17:04.044 --> 17:06.144
She made it clear she
didn't want to speak to me,

17:06.176 --> 17:07.678
so I-I let it go.

17:07.711 --> 17:09.611
I heard she had a rough time.

17:09.644 --> 17:11.077
Yeah.

17:11.109 --> 17:13.810
Like, a really rough time-
some sort of a breakdown.

17:13.845 --> 17:15.344
She should be landing any minute.

17:15.377 --> 17:16.743
Look, she didn't want to talk to me then,

17:16.778 --> 17:18.176
she's not gonna want to talk to me now,

17:18.211 --> 17:19.411
and I want to respect that.

17:19.444 --> 17:20.778
So, please, don't tell her I'm here, okay?

17:20.810 --> 17:22.611
You sure?

17:22.644 --> 17:23.977
Yeah. Okay.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.144
I'll be waiting for you

17:25.176 --> 17:26.144
up in Debrief One.

17:29.444 --> 17:31.811
We'll get you a full set of
photos as soon as possible.

17:31.845 --> 17:33.144
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

17:41.578 --> 17:42.544
Agent Ortiz.

17:42.578 --> 17:43.678
Mr. President.

17:43.711 --> 17:45.344
I want to thank you for saving my life.

17:45.377 --> 17:47.077
You're welcome, sir, but it wasn't just me.

17:47.110 --> 17:48.277
If it weren't for Jack Bauer

17:48.311 --> 17:49.644
and Chloe O'Brian, I wouldn't have been

17:49.678 --> 17:50.911
in place to make the save.

17:50.945 --> 17:51.977
Well, I'll thank them, too,

17:52.010 --> 17:53.878
but you risked your life for me.

17:53.911 --> 17:56.277
You put yourself between me and the bomb.

17:56.311 --> 17:57.444
My family and I

17:57.478 --> 17:58.778
are in your debt.

18:00.110 --> 18:01.110
What's that?

18:01.144 --> 18:03.144
It's a hazardous materials alert.

18:03.177 --> 18:04.644
Hazardous materials?

18:04.678 --> 18:05.977
Please wait here, sir.

18:09.411 --> 18:11.044
What's going on?

18:11.077 --> 18:12.845
The body triggered a hazmat alarm.

18:12.878 --> 18:14.511
We're reading radioactive contaminants.

18:14.544 --> 18:15.644
What sort of contaminants?

18:15.678 --> 18:17.911
Rad count's low, so it could be uranium.

18:17.945 --> 18:19.678
It's just trace elements.

18:19.711 --> 18:21.711
There's no danger.

18:22.778 --> 18:24.211
U-235?

18:24.244 --> 18:25.311
It's highly enriched uranium.

18:25.344 --> 18:27.211
You mean it's weapons-grade?

18:27.244 --> 18:28.878
Yes. How the hell did he

18:28.911 --> 18:29.911
come into contact with that?

18:29.945 --> 18:31.377
I don't know, but he had to

18:31.411 --> 18:32.644
have been exposed to it recently.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.478
I think I know the answer.

18:34.511 --> 18:35.977
What is it, sir?

18:37.344 --> 18:38.578
Sir, we're talking about nuclear materials.

18:38.611 --> 18:40.544
If you know something, you need to tell us.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.544
I need to talk to Mr. Hastings right now.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.024
Hey, Renee.

19:28.057 --> 19:29.390
It's good to see you.

19:29.423 --> 19:30.624
This way.

19:49.991 --> 19:53.390
Didn't know you were back at CTU.

19:53.423 --> 19:54.924
Yeah. Morris lost his job a year ago.

19:56.124 --> 19:57.258
I asked to be reinstated,

19:57.291 --> 19:58.657
and this is where they assigned me.

20:12.057 --> 20:13.757
So what about you?

20:13.790 --> 20:17.091
I heard you've been working
for a security firm.

20:17.124 --> 20:18.258
Uh, I was.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.291
Didn't work out.

20:27.224 --> 20:29.191
So it's confirmed and you're certain.

20:31.091 --> 20:33.423
Thanks.

20:33.457 --> 20:34.991
It's Forensics.

20:35.024 --> 20:36.957
They confirmed the composition
of the radioactive material.

20:36.991 --> 20:41.457
It's U-235, 94.7% pure,

20:41.490 --> 20:42.757
weapons-grade uranium.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.390
If you have an explanation, sir,

20:44.423 --> 20:45.857
I'm eager to hear it.

20:45.891 --> 20:49.358
Before we started this peace initiative,

20:49.390 --> 20:52.057
my country was close to
developing a nuclear weapon.

20:52.091 --> 20:54.191
Yes, our intelligence was aware of that.

20:54.224 --> 20:56.157
You may also be aware
that we could not enrich

20:56.191 --> 20:57.724
enough fissile material to arm it.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.291
Soon after our countries began

20:59.324 --> 21:02.624
to negotiate the peace process,
my brother came up to me

21:02.657 --> 21:04.557
and said that someone
had approached him with

21:04.590 --> 21:06.557
weapons-grade uranium.

21:06.590 --> 21:07.557
Who?

21:07.590 --> 21:08.624
Someone who had access

21:08.657 --> 21:10.724
to decommissioned Soviet stockpiles.

21:10.757 --> 21:12.124
You think it's

21:12.157 --> 21:14.557
the same Russians who were
trying to kill you today?

21:14.590 --> 21:16.590
Yes, I do.

21:16.624 --> 21:18.657
I told my brother to stay away from them,

21:18.690 --> 21:21.390
but obviously he had other plans.

21:21.423 --> 21:22.757
Mr. President,

21:22.790 --> 21:24.790
the nuclear material that you were offered,

21:24.824 --> 21:27.157
you have any idea where it is?

21:27.191 --> 21:28.891
That man was contaminated recently.

21:28.924 --> 21:30.490
Doesn't that mean the materials are here

21:30.523 --> 21:33.324
in the U.S.?

21:33.358 --> 21:37.258
Farhad always used to tell me
that our country will always

21:37.291 --> 21:39.024
be at the mercy of the West

21:39.057 --> 21:41.358
unless we become a nuclear power.

21:41.390 --> 21:42.590
You must find

21:42.624 --> 21:44.091
the Russians

21:44.124 --> 21:45.124
before they can get

21:45.157 --> 21:46.824
the uranium to my brother.

21:46.857 --> 21:48.590
We'll do what we have to do, sir.

21:48.624 --> 21:52.258
I'll notify my security
forces to cooperate fully.

21:56.091 --> 21:57.457
Patty,

21:57.490 --> 22:00.457
get me the file on Renee
Walker's undercover operation.

22:00.490 --> 22:02.390
The stars mean these men were
part of the criminal elite.

22:02.423 --> 22:03.624
<i>Vory v zakone.</i>

22:03.657 --> 22:04.991
This one spent time

22:05.024 --> 22:06.757
in a Siberian prison camp-- IK-10.

22:06.790 --> 22:09.191
The number of spires
means length of sentence.

22:09.224 --> 22:10.224
Three years?

22:10.258 --> 22:11.291
Three life terms.

22:11.324 --> 22:12.557
Must have escaped.

22:12.590 --> 22:15.891
Now these, broken cross,
here, here and here.

22:15.924 --> 22:17.557
Same on all three.

22:17.590 --> 22:20.224
So what does it mean?

22:20.258 --> 22:21.690
Brian Hastings,

22:21.724 --> 22:22.790
director of CTU.

22:22.824 --> 22:24.624
I appreciate that you came in.

22:24.657 --> 22:26.091
So what does it mean?

22:26.124 --> 22:27.790
It means you can break our arms,

22:27.824 --> 22:30.191
you can break every bone in our body-
we'll never talk.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.291
It's supposed to be the symbol

22:31.324 --> 22:33.291
for a group called Red Square.

22:33.324 --> 22:35.124
Supposed to be? We tried to find them

22:35.157 --> 22:36.258
and never got close.

22:36.291 --> 22:37.724
A lot of rumors that they're ex-military,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.557
special forces, intelligence, whatever.

22:39.590 --> 22:41.124
I'm not sure they actually exist.

22:41.157 --> 22:42.358
They exist, Ms. Walker.

22:42.390 --> 22:44.124
And we need to find them.

22:44.157 --> 22:45.423
Why?

22:45.457 --> 22:47.690
You're aware of the attack in midtown today?

22:47.724 --> 22:49.390
You mean the smoking crater by the UN?

22:49.423 --> 22:50.690
Yeah, it was hard to miss.

22:50.724 --> 22:52.423
Well, we believe it's just the beginning,

22:52.457 --> 22:53.824
and that the group responsible

22:53.857 --> 22:55.891
is in possession of
unsecured nuclear materials.

22:57.091 --> 22:58.423
Now Dana asked you here today

22:58.457 --> 22:59.991
to brief on background.

23:00.024 --> 23:02.191
But I have a much bigger ask.

23:04.024 --> 23:07.091
You were undercover for nearly
two years with the Russian mob.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.358
Your cover's still intact.

23:12.124 --> 23:15.124
What are you saying exactly?

23:15.157 --> 23:17.258
Are you... are you asking me to go back in?

23:19.124 --> 23:21.191
Dana, Chloe, would you
give us a moment, please?

23:28.557 --> 23:30.457
I wouldn't be asking if
it weren't important,

23:30.490 --> 23:32.091
but yes,

23:32.124 --> 23:33.891
I want you to go back in.

23:33.924 --> 23:36.224
And this doesn't seem in the least bit--

23:36.258 --> 23:38.091
I don't know, ironic to you?

23:38.124 --> 23:42.624
I know that you left the FBI
under difficult circumstances.

23:42.657 --> 23:45.724
Difficult doesn't even begin to describe it.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.557
I can get you your badge back.

23:47.590 --> 23:50.390
I laid down my badge, Mr. Hastings.

23:50.423 --> 23:52.624
I took it from my pocket and I laid it down.

23:52.657 --> 23:55.057
So why would you possibly
think that I want it back?

23:55.091 --> 23:57.924
Well, what do you want?

23:57.957 --> 24:00.523
What do I want?

24:00.557 --> 24:02.490
Nothing.

24:04.490 --> 24:09.557
You have weapons-grade uranium
in the hands of the Russian O.C.

24:09.590 --> 24:11.124
I can do something about that.

24:11.157 --> 24:13.258
So I'll go back in...

24:13.291 --> 24:16.091
but not for a badge.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.224
Thank you.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.924
We brief in ten minutes.

24:38.457 --> 24:40.624
Hey.

24:40.657 --> 24:42.358
Just want to say good-bye.

24:42.390 --> 24:43.624
You're off finally?

24:43.657 --> 24:45.224
Yeah.

24:45.258 --> 24:46.924
How did Renee's debriefing go?

24:46.957 --> 24:50.024
It was going fine until Hastings
kicked me out. Why'd he kick you out?

24:50.057 --> 24:52.490
It just started to get really uncomfortable.

24:52.523 --> 24:54.824
Is that her undercover file?

24:54.857 --> 24:56.790
Yeah. I'm just trying to get up to speed.

24:56.824 --> 24:59.523
They found traces of
uranium on the assassin.

24:59.557 --> 25:01.657
Hastings says there's
nuclear materials in play.

25:01.690 --> 25:02.857
Yeah, I heard.

25:02.891 --> 25:04.390
What's that got to do with Renee?

25:04.423 --> 25:06.957
He asked her to go back
under with the Russians.

25:12.991 --> 25:14.390
What is it?

25:23.224 --> 25:24.757
Hey.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.857
Jack.

25:33.124 --> 25:34.824
Chloe didn't tell me you were here.

25:34.857 --> 25:37.690
I asked her not to.

25:37.724 --> 25:39.590
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

25:39.624 --> 25:40.857
Right.

25:40.891 --> 25:44.157
You tried to get in touch,
and I didn't call back.

25:44.191 --> 25:45.358
Sorry.

25:45.390 --> 25:49.057
I was so happy to hear
that you were okay, though.

25:49.091 --> 25:50.324
Thank you.

25:50.358 --> 25:52.191
I'm surprised that you're back at CTU.

25:52.224 --> 25:54.358
I'm actually not.

25:54.390 --> 25:56.057
I'm moving back to Los
Angeles with my daughter.

25:56.091 --> 25:58.157
I'm supposed to be on a
plane with her right now.

25:58.191 --> 26:00.523
Then what are you doing here?

26:00.557 --> 26:02.258
An old informant knocked on my door.

26:02.291 --> 26:03.724
Everything went downhill from there.

26:03.757 --> 26:04.857
The attack in midtown.

26:04.891 --> 26:06.191
That's why I'm here, too.

26:06.224 --> 26:08.091
I heard Hastings wants you to go undercover

26:08.124 --> 26:09.224
with the Russians again.

26:09.258 --> 26:11.757
He does. I've agreed.

26:11.790 --> 26:14.423
You really think that's a good idea?

26:14.457 --> 26:15.857
They need me.

26:15.891 --> 26:18.857
I'm not worried about them.

26:18.891 --> 26:21.091
I'm worried about you.

26:21.124 --> 26:24.224
I know what you did.

26:24.258 --> 26:28.024
Really, Jack? What did I do?

26:28.057 --> 26:30.523
You almost killed Wilson
during your interrogation.

26:30.557 --> 26:33.790
In fact it was so bad,
the FBI had to let you go.

26:33.824 --> 26:36.423
Even after everything you did that day.

26:36.457 --> 26:41.057
Renee, I know where you are,
and it's a dark place.

26:41.091 --> 26:42.590
Yeah, and I've come back.

26:42.624 --> 26:43.957
It takes longer than you think.

26:43.991 --> 26:46.457
I wouldn't have signed up
for this if I wasn't ready.

26:46.490 --> 26:47.891
And I don't think you are.

26:56.490 --> 26:59.790
Renee, this is too important.

26:59.824 --> 27:02.091
You need to let them take
care of it. They will.

27:05.057 --> 27:08.091
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, really.

27:08.124 --> 27:09.423
You said you were going to Los Angeles

27:09.457 --> 27:10.757
to be with your daughter, right?

27:10.790 --> 27:12.991
Please don't do this.
Go to California, Jack.

27:14.824 --> 27:16.657
I have a briefing.

27:30.813 --> 27:32.946
You will receive an official apology

27:32.980 --> 27:34.613
for your detention here, but in the meantime

27:34.646 --> 27:36.980
I hope you can accept my
sincere personal regrets.

27:37.013 --> 27:38.879
I'm sure you understand
that given the threat

27:38.913 --> 27:40.145
to President Hassan,

27:40.179 --> 27:41.279
we were under extreme pressure.

27:41.312 --> 27:43.346
I would have thought that came with the job.

27:43.379 --> 27:44.646
Along with the ability

27:44.679 --> 27:46.279
to handle it.

27:47.579 --> 27:49.646
Good-bye, Mr. Hastings.

27:50.980 --> 27:52.279
Ms. Reed.

27:57.212 --> 27:58.980
Thank God you're all right.

27:59.013 --> 28:01.512
I was lucky.

28:01.546 --> 28:05.646
I heard it was Farhad who
tried to have you killed.

28:05.679 --> 28:09.179
I can't believe he would betray you.

28:09.212 --> 28:10.813
He betrayed both of us, Meredith.

28:10.846 --> 28:13.846
And then I betrayed you.

28:13.879 --> 28:16.446
What are you talking about?

28:16.479 --> 28:19.412
I told them about us.

28:19.446 --> 28:22.145
I was scared. I panicked.

28:22.179 --> 28:24.546
I hope you can forgive me.

28:24.579 --> 28:26.046
There's nothing to forgive.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
But you stood by me.

28:28.112 --> 28:30.179
You didn't deny me.

28:30.212 --> 28:32.212
Even though you had a million reasons to.

28:32.245 --> 28:34.879
Before that moment, I...

28:34.913 --> 28:38.913
I never really knew what you felt for me.

28:38.946 --> 28:41.145
You should have.

28:41.179 --> 28:43.546
Didn't I make it clear?

28:48.579 --> 28:51.245
What? What is it?

28:51.279 --> 28:54.412
I nearly died today.

28:55.946 --> 29:00.179
And I saw how fragile it all is.

29:00.212 --> 29:04.212
Not only my life, but
everything I've ever worked for.

29:04.245 --> 29:07.546
Any good I might be able to do.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.679
I just can't jeopardize that.

29:12.779 --> 29:15.879
I understand.

29:15.913 --> 29:17.046
I'm sorry.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.579
Don't be.

29:25.479 --> 29:27.245
Meredith...

29:58.946 --> 30:00.946
Six years ago I was
undercover with these men.

30:00.980 --> 30:02.779
They were running an arms trafficking ring.

30:02.813 --> 30:05.245
We broke up the ring and arrested everyone

30:05.279 --> 30:06.746
except for the man in charge-
Vladimir Laitanan.

30:06.779 --> 30:08.145
He's our target.

30:08.179 --> 30:10.346
It was through him I first heard
about the group Red Square.

30:10.379 --> 30:12.512
If anyone can connect us to them it's him.

30:12.546 --> 30:13.846
Everything I've read about Laitanan

30:13.879 --> 30:15.112
says he disappeared without a trace.

30:15.145 --> 30:16.613
How are you going to find him?

30:16.646 --> 30:17.980
Through this guy.

30:18.013 --> 30:19.279
Ziya Dakhilov.

30:19.312 --> 30:20.412
He's out on parole.

30:20.446 --> 30:21.913
He'll take us to Vladimir.

30:21.946 --> 30:25.013
The FBI offered Ziya full
immunity if he gave up Vladimir.

30:25.046 --> 30:26.312
He turned it down and kept

30:26.346 --> 30:27.779
his mouth shut and did his time.

30:27.813 --> 30:29.779
I'm not FBI, I'm a former felon, remember?

30:29.813 --> 30:31.980
I'll be offering Ziya
the deal of a lifetime.

30:32.013 --> 30:33.212
Trust me, he'll take it.

30:33.245 --> 30:35.179
Once I've made contact with Vladimir,

30:35.212 --> 30:36.679
I'll tell him that I've heard whispers

30:36.713 --> 30:38.145
of nuclear materials on the market.

30:38.179 --> 30:39.613
I'll say I have a buyer for them.

30:39.646 --> 30:40.813
Who's that going to be? Agent Ortiz?

30:40.846 --> 30:42.112
You up for this?

30:42.145 --> 30:43.212
Yes, sir.

30:43.245 --> 30:44.613
How much money are we talking about?

30:44.646 --> 30:46.779
For nuclear rods,
we need to show offshore accounts

30:46.813 --> 30:48.980
of $100 million at least.
Probably twice that.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.679
Okay, I'll get on that.

30:50.713 --> 30:52.179
Chloe will work up a backstory to cover

30:52.212 --> 30:53.646
the time after your release from prison.

30:53.679 --> 30:55.479
Now you and Agent Ortiz need to figure out

30:55.512 --> 30:56.613
where you met,

30:56.646 --> 30:58.279
how long you've known each other.

30:58.312 --> 31:00.013
Jack.

31:00.046 --> 31:01.779
I thought you'd left.

31:01.813 --> 31:03.512
I'm sorry to interrupt.

31:03.546 --> 31:05.813
But could I have the room with Mr.
Hastings alone, please?

31:10.779 --> 31:12.846
You, too, Renee.

31:12.879 --> 31:14.746
I think I'll stay.

31:16.046 --> 31:17.980
So what's going on, Jack?

31:18.013 --> 31:20.412
Agent Walker hasn't been
undercover for over six years.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.346
I think you're making a
mistake by putting her in.

31:22.379 --> 31:25.813
Why don't you tell him what's
really on your mind, Jack?

31:25.846 --> 31:27.379
I'll tell him exactly what I told you.

31:27.412 --> 31:28.646
I'm concerned about her,

31:28.679 --> 31:30.013
and this operation.

31:30.046 --> 31:32.145
So what does that mean?

31:32.179 --> 31:33.913
She's not ready for this.

31:33.946 --> 31:35.112
You must have other options.

31:35.145 --> 31:36.212
Mr. Hastings,

31:36.245 --> 31:37.713
no one else knows these Russians.

31:37.746 --> 31:39.980
No one else can get you as close.

31:40.013 --> 31:41.379
Unfortunately, I'm your only choice.

31:41.412 --> 31:44.512
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

31:44.546 --> 31:45.512
but she's right.

31:45.546 --> 31:47.179
She's our only way in.

31:49.312 --> 31:51.446
Fine, then I want to go with her.

31:51.479 --> 31:52.946
I assume your plan is trying

31:52.980 --> 31:54.279
to set up a competing buy?

31:54.312 --> 31:55.646
I'll act as a buyer.

31:55.679 --> 31:57.379
That won't be necessary.
Agent Ortiz has already agreed.

31:57.412 --> 31:59.579
He doesn't have the experience.
Then this is how he gets it.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.346
Not with nuclear weapons on the line.

32:01.379 --> 32:03.379
Mr. Hastings,

32:03.412 --> 32:04.779
I'm officially requesting

32:04.813 --> 32:05.946
that you send me in

32:05.980 --> 32:07.546
with Agent Walker.

32:07.579 --> 32:10.046
Jack, if you're willing to do this,
I'd be foolish to object.

32:10.080 --> 32:13.312
We'll work up a cover for you

32:13.346 --> 32:14.646
and dovetail it with Agent Walker's alias.

32:14.679 --> 32:16.046
We're going to have to work fast.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.879
The Russians are going to want
to unload the nuclear fuel rods

32:17.913 --> 32:19.112
as quickly as possible.

32:25.613 --> 32:27.913
I'm sorry.

32:34.746 --> 32:37.046
Are you sure this information is reliable?

32:37.080 --> 32:38.212
MAN : It checks out.

32:38.245 --> 32:40.212
All right then.

32:40.245 --> 32:41.312
Farhad is here.

32:41.346 --> 32:43.013
Bring him in.

32:45.946 --> 32:48.479
You look worried.

32:48.512 --> 32:50.679
Every cop in the country
is hunting this man,

32:50.713 --> 32:52.212
but we let him come here?

32:52.245 --> 32:56.312
So, how does looking like
a scared girl help us?

32:57.879 --> 32:59.579
This man is our buyer.

32:59.613 --> 33:01.512
Well, we found him,

33:01.546 --> 33:03.546
we can find another.

33:03.579 --> 33:06.879
Josef, my son, we are on the verge

33:06.913 --> 33:08.779
of the biggest deal of our lives.

33:08.813 --> 33:10.946
Farhad is paying us more
than anyone dreamed possible,

33:10.980 --> 33:13.579
and you want to send him away
because he makes you nervous?

33:25.980 --> 33:27.546
Sit down, please.

33:27.579 --> 33:29.312
A drink first, then some food.

33:29.346 --> 33:30.679
I want to see the rods.

33:30.713 --> 33:32.879
They will be on the same ship

33:32.913 --> 33:34.512
that will transport you
back to your country.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.179
As soon as we have completed

33:37.212 --> 33:38.512
our financial arrangements.

33:38.546 --> 33:42.346
You'll be paid, Bazhaev,
after I have the rods.

33:42.379 --> 33:43.779
They are in a secure place.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.013
Show me.

33:45.046 --> 33:46.312
You've seen the photographs.

33:46.346 --> 33:48.080
That's not good enough.

33:48.112 --> 33:49.112
I want proof that

33:49.145 --> 33:51.046
the rods exist or you will not be paid.

33:53.746 --> 33:54.879
You want proof, huh?

33:54.913 --> 33:56.080
Okay.

33:56.112 --> 33:56.980
Come with me.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.512
Josef...

34:29.312 --> 34:31.179
My younger son.

34:31.212 --> 34:33.545
He was transporting the rods...

34:35.080 --> 34:37.179
...and he was careless.

34:39.112 --> 34:41.913
There. You have your proof.

34:46.145 --> 34:48.512
How long will it take to
get the rods to the ship?

34:48.545 --> 34:50.245
Five hours.

34:50.279 --> 34:52.713
I want to be there to supervise the loading.

34:52.746 --> 34:54.913
Whatever you want, my friend.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.746
Now where is my money?

35:01.980 --> 35:03.980
I'll make the call.

35:21.526 --> 35:25.793
Agent Walker worked undercover
as Renee Zadan for 16 months

35:25.826 --> 35:27.493
before the bust went down
and she was incarcerated.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.125
We're focusing on the period
of time just after her release

35:30.159 --> 35:33.359
when she's supposed to be
in Mexico working with Jack.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.359
We're synchronizing two
years of travel materials

35:35.392 --> 35:37.125
mostly to and from Mexico City.

35:37.159 --> 35:39.092
What all do we know about
this Ziya character

35:39.125 --> 35:40.259
that she's visiting?

35:40.292 --> 35:41.659
Not much.

35:41.693 --> 35:45.259
He pled out to a clas
s-three felony one month after the bust.

35:45.292 --> 35:48.092
He's now in Long Island City
working in an auto parts store

35:48.125 --> 35:49.426
as a condition to his early release.

35:49.459 --> 35:51.659
That's where Jack and Renee are headed now.

35:51.693 --> 35:52.693
Where exactly are they?

35:52.726 --> 35:54.025
En route. Just leaving Manhattan.

35:54.059 --> 35:56.759
Good. Chloe, download the
cover materials to them.

35:56.793 --> 35:59.459
Walk them through it.
Make sure there's no surprises.

36:06.426 --> 36:08.226
Jack, it's Chloe.

36:08.259 --> 36:10.559
You should be receiving
a consolidated timeline

36:10.593 --> 36:12.860
plus detail files for travel and residency.

36:12.893 --> 36:14.559
Have they downloaded to your PDA yet?

36:14.593 --> 36:15.926
Yes, we got it, Chloe.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.392
Oh, and Dana would like for me

36:17.426 --> 36:19.159
to review the facts with you,
if that's okay.

36:19.192 --> 36:20.893
We're fine, Chloe.
I know how to prep a cover.

36:20.926 --> 36:23.826
I'm sure you do, it's just that...
Chloe, it's all right.

36:23.860 --> 36:25.426
As soon as we got something,
we'll get back to you.

36:25.459 --> 36:27.192
Okay, I guess

36:27.226 --> 36:28.926
I will leave you then. Good luck.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.226
Thanks.

36:30.259 --> 36:31.826
You got a problem?

36:31.860 --> 36:33.226
No, just that you've got

36:33.259 --> 36:34.860
everyone treating me like I'm an invalid.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.092
No one's treating you like an invalid.

36:36.125 --> 36:37.359
It's standard procedure.

36:37.392 --> 36:38.726
They're trying to sync up two cover stories.

36:38.759 --> 36:40.125
He's not gonna quiz me on the facts, Jack.

36:40.159 --> 36:42.125
He gonna take one look at
me and decide if I'm lying.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.992
I know. And whatever happens after that,
we need to be ready.

36:47.459 --> 36:50.125
It's hard being with you
when you don't think

36:50.159 --> 36:51.693
that I'm up to this.

36:51.726 --> 36:53.726
I never said you weren't up to this.

36:53.759 --> 36:56.059
I said I was concerned about you.
It's different.

36:56.092 --> 36:57.259
Whatever you call it,

36:57.292 --> 36:59.893
the fact is you don't trust me, not really.

37:01.759 --> 37:05.092
So here we are.

37:05.125 --> 37:07.426
Me and my babysitter.

37:16.893 --> 37:18.226
How are we on aerial?

37:18.259 --> 37:20.693
Already in place and
they're not even there yet.

37:20.726 --> 37:22.826
Jack and Renee are five minutes from target.

37:22.860 --> 37:24.860
They should arrive just
before he closes up shop.

37:26.359 --> 37:27.926
Walsh.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.992
Someday, you're going to have

37:30.025 --> 37:31.726
to tell me how you picked that name.

37:31.759 --> 37:33.192
I can't talk now.

37:33.226 --> 37:35.860
I like your apartment, Jenny. Real homey.

37:35.893 --> 37:37.893
And I gotta compliment you
on your housekeeping skills,

37:37.926 --> 37:40.125
everything is in its place.

37:40.159 --> 37:43.025
And I've been admiring your photos,

37:43.059 --> 37:45.359
I hope you don't mind.

37:45.392 --> 37:48.259
And I've noticed kind of a theme.

37:48.292 --> 37:49.826
You and your boyfriend, I'm guessing.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.459
Is that right?

37:51.493 --> 37:52.559
Yes.

37:52.593 --> 37:54.292
I hope it's not too serious.

37:54.326 --> 37:56.793
We're getting married, Kevin.

37:56.826 --> 37:58.493
Wow.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.059
Who would have guessed?

38:00.092 --> 38:01.826
When I saw you, you weren't exactly wearing

38:01.860 --> 38:03.192
an engagement ring.

38:03.226 --> 38:04.693
So tell me about him.

38:04.726 --> 38:05.960
Kevin, don't.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.526
Don't what?

38:07.559 --> 38:09.593
I'm curious, can you blame me?

38:09.626 --> 38:13.192
He's... he's just a guy that I met.

38:13.226 --> 38:14.759
A guy you met.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.826
What's that mean, a guy you met?

38:16.860 --> 38:18.359
I just spent seven years
in prison with some guys.

38:18.392 --> 38:21.159
Is that the kind of guy you mean?

38:21.192 --> 38:22.826
You know what? I'm beginning to see that

38:22.860 --> 38:24.493
we need to talk about this in person.

38:24.526 --> 38:27.025
Look, I told you that I'm in
the middle of a crisis here.

38:27.059 --> 38:28.192
I can't. I don't have time.

38:28.226 --> 38:30.059
You know what, Jenny? In my experience,

38:30.092 --> 38:31.392
when something's important,
you make time for it.

38:31.426 --> 38:32.559
Don't you think?

38:34.693 --> 38:36.125
Jenny, are you there?

38:36.159 --> 38:37.359
Don't call me that!

38:37.392 --> 38:38.359
What?

38:38.392 --> 38:39.493
I said...!

38:39.526 --> 38:41.426
You don't tell me what to call you,

38:41.459 --> 38:43.459
what not to call you, you understand that?!

38:43.493 --> 38:44.860
I'll call you whatever I want!

38:44.893 --> 38:46.526
You don't tell me anything, Jenny!

38:48.826 --> 38:50.092
Now get back here.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.759
I said...

38:53.793 --> 38:56.392
that I will

38:56.426 --> 38:58.459
as soon as I can.

38:58.493 --> 39:01.226
Yeah, well, it better be soon.

39:38.326 --> 39:39.426
That's him.

39:41.426 --> 39:42.926
Looks like he's closing up.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.125
Okay, we'll use these for comm so I can

39:45.159 --> 39:47.759
hear you in case you get into trouble. Okay.

39:52.926 --> 39:54.025
Hey.

39:56.226 --> 39:57.659
This is your last shot.

39:57.693 --> 39:58.960
You do not have to do this.

39:58.992 --> 40:01.092
I know, but I want to.

40:19.926 --> 40:21.526
: We're closed.

40:23.726 --> 40:26.226
What'd I say?

40:27.960 --> 40:29.593
Renee.

40:31.226 --> 40:32.192
Ziya.

40:32.226 --> 40:33.926
Nice outfit. Not a lot

40:33.960 --> 40:35.459
of men can pull off a skirt.

40:35.493 --> 40:36.992
When did you get out?

40:37.025 --> 40:39.793
I thought you were serving seven-to-ten.

40:39.826 --> 40:42.192
They let me out early. Good behavior.

40:42.226 --> 40:44.726
Good behavior.

40:44.759 --> 40:46.059
With warden?

40:46.092 --> 40:47.793
Well, eventually, yeah.

40:47.826 --> 40:50.860
But it's like anything else,
you gotta work your way up.

40:55.159 --> 40:57.392
So why you here?

40:57.426 --> 40:59.192
I'm looking for Vladimir.

40:59.226 --> 41:01.992
Got a business proposition I
know he'd be interested in.

41:02.025 --> 41:04.025
What kind of business proposition?

41:04.059 --> 41:07.493
Got a buyer, something big being sold.

41:07.526 --> 41:11.559
Yeah? I don't know. Vlad disappear.

41:11.593 --> 41:13.826
Hmm, maybe.

41:15.292 --> 41:17.326
But you can find him.

41:17.359 --> 41:20.493
Really? Why I do that?

41:20.526 --> 41:23.159
Why do you think?

41:23.192 --> 41:24.992
I don't know.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.860
I'll cut you in.

41:26.893 --> 41:29.125
Unless, of course,
you're making so much money here

41:29.159 --> 41:31.092
that that's of no interest to you.

41:32.292 --> 41:34.426
See? Your greedy little eyes are saying,

41:34.459 --> 41:37.459
"Show me the money,
" so what's the problem, Ziya?

41:41.860 --> 41:43.693
Parole bracelet?

41:43.726 --> 41:46.459
They know where I am 24-7.

41:46.493 --> 41:47.526
I'm like dog.

41:47.559 --> 41:48.860
I leave yard, I get shock.

41:48.893 --> 41:51.726
Well, then just help me out.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.326
Make some calls.

41:53.359 --> 41:54.860
Make calls?

41:54.893 --> 41:57.025
You know what happen I make
call asking where's Vladimir?

41:57.059 --> 42:00.059
Tomorrow, have accident on way for work.

42:01.559 --> 42:02.860
No, sensitive information,

42:02.893 --> 42:04.960
done face-to-face, you know that.

42:04.992 --> 42:06.192
You're lucky.

42:06.226 --> 42:10.559
You get out. Me, I'm still in prison.

42:10.593 --> 42:11.960
Let me see the bracelet.

42:11.992 --> 42:12.726
No.

42:12.759 --> 42:13.726
Come on. No.

42:13.759 --> 42:14.860
Let me see it, Ziya. Hmm?

42:14.893 --> 42:17.326
Ziya... What?

42:17.359 --> 42:19.226
Have I ever messed you up ever?

42:19.259 --> 42:21.826
Come on.

42:23.593 --> 42:24.926
Let's see.

42:38.326 --> 42:41.793
I can get this off, guaranteed.

42:41.826 --> 42:44.392
You screw with this, you know what happen?

42:44.426 --> 42:45.826
Cops come running in.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.893
In two hours, I'm back inside.

42:47.926 --> 42:49.860
Parole violation. Shh...

42:49.893 --> 42:51.693
What? That's not gonna happen,
I'm telling you.

42:51.726 --> 42:53.292
I know how to get this off.

42:53.326 --> 42:55.192
How do you know?
'Cause I'm constantly having

42:55.226 --> 42:57.392
to deal with people like you, that's how.

42:59.326 --> 43:02.125
I can get it off if I
can just hold it steady.

43:13.659 --> 43:15.526
But... you can't cut bracelet.

43:15.559 --> 43:17.025
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

43:50.493 --> 43:52.493
What have you done?

43:52.526 --> 43:54.459
What the hell have you done?!

43:54.493 --> 43:56.092
Like he said, he was trapped here.

43:56.125 --> 43:57.926
And think he's gonna help you now?!

43:57.960 --> 43:59.426
That's it. This is over.

43:59.459 --> 44:00.860
This is over!

44:00.893 --> 44:02.826
Maybe for you, Jack,
but I'm just getting started.

44:02.860 --> 44:04.326
Find something to cauterize that wound.

44:13.392 --> 44:14.826
Damn it.
