-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.467
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.500 --> 00:40.733
in a court of law.

00:41.933 --> 00:43.633
-I grew up in this community.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.300
Went to school
for a little while. I decided

00:45.333 --> 00:47.167
I wanted
to do somethin' different.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.500
One day I applied
to be a police officer,

00:49.533 --> 00:52.367
and I was hired on,
and I've been lovin' it
ever since.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.067
Certain people come in contact
with us on a regular basis,

00:56.100 --> 00:59.000
and I just like findin' out
their past stories
and things like that.

00:59.033 --> 01:02.200
I also like, uh, finding drugs
and things of that nature,

01:02.233 --> 01:04.167
and-- and getting drugs
off the street.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.900
This store here has a lot
of drug use inside the store.

01:06.933 --> 01:08.567
They go in there,
and they'll get syringes,

01:08.600 --> 01:10.867
and they'll go in the bathroom
and actually inject
inside the bathroom,

01:10.900 --> 01:12.100
it's kind of interesting.

01:12.133 --> 01:15.067
I just observed a subject
leave a vehicle here,

01:15.067 --> 01:16.267
and he picked something up,

01:16.300 --> 01:18.600
and he kinda got behind
a propane tank display rack.

01:18.633 --> 01:21.267
It's suspicious, so we're just
gonna do a little follow-up

01:21.300 --> 01:22.367
just to see what's goin' on.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.300
There's a silver car.
Is that him?

01:25.333 --> 01:27.667
-(radio chatter)

01:27.700 --> 01:30.100
I don't know.
There was a female in there,

01:30.133 --> 01:32.467
blonde hair, so...

01:32.500 --> 01:35.700
-All right, all right...
-Runner! Stop!

01:35.733 --> 01:38.600
-2 Adam 15...
-2 Adam 15, foot pursuit.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.767
-Foot pursuit, eastbound.
-Eastbound Battlefield, he's...

01:43.800 --> 01:46.900
-Campbell, and...
the-- the Walgreen's.

01:46.933 --> 01:49.700
-Stop, police!

01:49.733 --> 01:53.167
-(sirens)

01:55.433 --> 01:57.300
-White male, dark hair,
with a beard.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.433
It's a gray or blue t-shirt.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.100
-Hey, let's go down here
to where we last saw him.

02:06.133 --> 02:08.233
-Yeah. Shoulda had him.
-Crap!

02:08.267 --> 02:10.800
-(radio chatter)

02:10.833 --> 02:14.933
-All right, so...
we rounded here,
came this way...

02:14.967 --> 02:18.633
-We lost him right there
at those trees.

02:18.667 --> 02:23.367
-(radio chatter)

02:23.400 --> 02:25.767
-2 Adam 15.
There should be two occupants

02:25.800 --> 02:29.267
in a silver car right there
next to a car.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.733
Start lookin' under stuff.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.833
-He was last seen just north
of, at the apartments.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.800
So I don't know
if he's in these bushes
right here or not.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.733
Um, he just disappeared
when we got to the apartments.

02:44.167 --> 02:47.967
I mean, you were there.
-Last saw him...
40 feet away.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.300
-'Cause I was right--
I mean, you were--

02:51.333 --> 02:53.233
-He was west of,
and it looked like
he weaved in.

02:53.267 --> 02:54.700
And that's the last I saw.

02:54.733 --> 02:56.400
I coulda swore
he was in here somewhere.

02:56.433 --> 02:57.933
And he might be.

02:57.967 --> 03:00.933
-(exhaling)
He came right through here.
Last time we saw him

03:00.967 --> 03:03.400
was right there.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.700
Don't move! Put your hands up!
-Put your hands up!

03:06.733 --> 03:09.367
Hands up!
-Both of 'em!
Get that other one up!

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
Step up!
Stand up!

03:11.433 --> 03:15.067
-Get on your belly!
Get on your belly now!

03:15.067 --> 03:16.367
Get on your belly now!

03:16.400 --> 03:17.600
-Apologize.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.133
-Get your hand
behind your back now!
Get it out!

03:20.667 --> 03:22.500
Get your hands behind your back!

03:22.533 --> 03:24.633
-My other hand's stuck.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.067
-Don't move!

03:26.067 --> 03:28.400
-Get on your feet.

03:28.433 --> 03:29.533
Get on your feet.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.667
-I need help.
-Roll over.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.300
Do you have any weapons on you?

03:33.333 --> 03:35.067
-We got one in custody...
-Huh?

03:35.067 --> 03:36.600
All right.
Can you sit up?
I'm gonna help you

03:36.633 --> 03:39.367
outta these bushes.
You ready?
one, two, three...(grunts)

03:39.400 --> 03:41.667
Hey, we need somebody
go contact the car
that he was in

03:41.700 --> 03:43.433
over there.
-I have a warrant.

03:43.467 --> 03:45.300
-I know you do.
That's why
we're chasin' you.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.800
That's why you ran, right?
-Yes, sir.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.467
-Not hurt or anything?
-No.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.967
-Pride hurt a little bit?
-Yeah.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.467
-Mine is, too, 'cause
you lost us for a second, but...
(chuckles)

03:52.500 --> 03:54.433
-All right. What's
your probation warrant for?

03:54.467 --> 03:57.133
-Just a violation.
-Just a violation?
What'd you violate?

03:57.167 --> 03:58.867
I don't wanna say right now.
-Okay.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.333
-He's sayin'
that he has
a probation violation.

04:01.367 --> 04:04.300
We were actually looking
for a male associated
with the vehicle

04:04.333 --> 04:07.300
who had a couple
of domestic violence
warrants, so...

04:07.333 --> 04:09.633
-All right. I'm gonna
have you sit in the car
a sec, okay?

04:09.667 --> 04:12.233
Just have a seat in there.
However you wanna get in,
I don't care.

04:12.267 --> 04:15.100
Okay, just be careful
not to hit your head.

04:15.133 --> 04:18.567
You can do it.
Wuh wuh, I'm gonna
help you there,

04:18.600 --> 04:21.533
just a little bit,
just-- you got it.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.100
There you go.

04:23.133 --> 04:26.667
I'm gonna go talk
to this girl over here
and see what's goin' on.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.633
-(radio chatter)

04:32.067 --> 04:34.467
Do you have a female?
-Yeah, she's in my car.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.467
-Okay. We're gonna
go talk to her.

04:37.533 --> 04:40.267
-This is unbelievable.
-It is unbelievable.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.133
Come out and talk to us,
let's see what's goin' on here.

04:42.167 --> 04:44.300
-I don't really
know him that well.
-Okay, well, hold on a second.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.200
What-- so, what is goin' on,
'cause I saw you guys--

04:47.233 --> 04:50.267
I saw him get outta your car
and walk across the parkin' lot,
and he--

04:50.300 --> 04:51.833
looked like
he picked somethin' up,
and he kinda

04:51.867 --> 04:53.633
went behind that, uh...
propane container.

04:53.667 --> 04:57.533
-I wasn't paying attention,
I was on the phone
with my friend, she knows him.

04:57.567 --> 04:59.333
-She knows him?
-I don't really know him
real well.

04:59.367 --> 05:02.300
He seems like the nicest--
real nice person...
-So why are you here?

05:02.333 --> 05:05.833
Why are you and that person
at this location?
-Oh, I've come here today

05:05.867 --> 05:09.767
to visit my friend,
and I was gonna return
his pots and pans...

05:09.800 --> 05:11.800
-Okay.
-and uh... yeah...

05:11.833 --> 05:14.867
-So, you brought him with you
just for... company or what?

05:14.900 --> 05:17.133
-Yeah, yeah, 'cause he didn't
have really nowhere to go.

05:17.167 --> 05:19.167
-Oh, okay, so you
were comin' up here to re--
-He's gonna live

05:19.200 --> 05:20.867
with my friend's mom
in Bolivar.
-Okay.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.267
-And she was on the phone
when this all happened,
and I could hear her going,

05:23.300 --> 05:27.200
Tina? He has a warrant,
and it's like, I was like,
you know, really? Really?

05:27.233 --> 05:29.833
-I understand.
So you came up here
to return some items

05:29.867 --> 05:31.733
you purchased?
-And just comin'
to visit some friends.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.467
-Okay. Why did he
go in the store
and you didn't?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.700
-I didn't wanna go in there.
I didn't have anything
to go there for.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.700
-Oh, you weren't returning
the items here.
-No, I wasn't even

05:37.733 --> 05:40.167
goin' in there.
I think-- no,
I was on the phone with her,

05:40.200 --> 05:42.400
I wasn't paying attention...
-Why did he tell you

05:42.433 --> 05:45.300
to stop here, then?
-He didn't, he was driving.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.667
-Oh, he was driving.
-I let him drive my new car,
yes, okay?

05:47.700 --> 05:50.400
-Oh, okay...
-Hey, Tina, is this
your new car over here?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.067
-Yes.
-Do you care if I search
the car, make sure

05:52.067 --> 05:54.133
there's nothing illegal
in there?
-No...

05:54.167 --> 05:56.333
-Great. Great.
-You're not gettin' arrested
or anything like that.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.800
-Great. Okay.

05:58.833 --> 06:02.200
We got consent from the owner
to conduct a search.

06:02.233 --> 06:06.100
Currently searching the vehicle
for any illegal contraband.

06:06.133 --> 06:10.067
Uh, we haven't found anything
that is illegal at this time.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.200
-(horn honks)

06:15.100 --> 06:16.500
-Had to get medical out here.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.900
He was running
pretty fast a minute ago.
Now he's claiming

06:19.933 --> 06:22.533
that he's taken
some methamphetamine.
He said he ingested

06:22.567 --> 06:24.367
some earlier, so I don't know

06:24.400 --> 06:27.867
if maybe from the--
from the run, gettin'
his heart rate up,

06:27.900 --> 06:29.667
that, uh, along
with the methamphetamine,

06:29.700 --> 06:31.933
it's caused him
to have some heart palpitations.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.700
But, uh, we'll
have to get him cleared
before we take him to jail

06:34.733 --> 06:36.700
and make sure he's okay.

06:36.733 --> 06:40.367
Ma'am? All right,
just back up here,
and then go out on this side

06:40.400 --> 06:43.067
of the parking lot.
You're free to leave,
all right?

06:43.067 --> 06:46.800
Uh, the medics are sayin'
that they're wanting to take him
to the hospital.

06:46.833 --> 06:51.067
He's profusely sweating.
-Yeah. He's told the officer
that he used methamphetamine

06:51.067 --> 06:54.667
earlier today, so we're
gonna have to, uh,
follow the ambulance

06:54.700 --> 06:57.733
to the hospital,
and we'll sit on him
until he gets medically cleared,

06:57.767 --> 06:59.200
and then we'll take him
to jail.

06:59.233 --> 07:02.067
End of the day,
he's still goin' to jail.

07:05.533 --> 07:08.333
-Um... I go to the gym
whenever I can

07:08.367 --> 07:11.300
to try to maintain
a certain standard.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.400
Whenever duck season
comes in season,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.067
I'll go duck huntin' as well.

07:15.067 --> 07:18.733
Kinda helps-- gets me away
from my, uh... my job,
and hang out

07:18.767 --> 07:20.500
with some friends
who aren't in law enforcement.

07:20.533 --> 07:23.933
Helps me unwind.

07:23.967 --> 07:29.600
Got behind this van--
it's showin' a pattern
of drivin' erratic.

07:29.633 --> 07:33.333
I'm gonna go talk to her
about not usin' a turn signal
back there.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.067
-Hey!
-Huh?

07:37.067 --> 07:39.567
-I'm Deputy Kophazy
of the Sheriff's Office.
How are you?

07:39.600 --> 07:43.233
-I'm okay.
-Okay. Why didn't you--
why didn't you use your--

07:43.267 --> 07:47.667
um, turn signal in here?
-Because somebody
was aggravatin' the crap

07:47.700 --> 07:50.300
outta me on the phone.
-Oh, okay.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.967
-Um, that's all.
-You got your driver's license
with you?

07:53.067 --> 07:57.067
-Yeah. See?
-Let me see your
driver's license, dear.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.233
-Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
-(radio chatter)

07:59.267 --> 08:03.300
-It's gonna be a white van.
Stand by for the tag.

08:05.067 --> 08:10.067
-If you got a
heat car,
can you send 'em this way?)

08:10.100 --> 08:11.900
-(radio chatter)

08:11.933 --> 08:15.400
-My stepmom used to work
for Richmond County,
her name's Sherry.

08:15.433 --> 08:19.067
-I'm sorry, I was listenin'
to my radio, what--
what'd you say?

08:19.067 --> 08:21.233
-My stepmother,
she used to be, um...
I don't know

08:21.267 --> 08:23.467
if she still is on the force,
but... Sherry?

08:23.500 --> 08:26.467
-Sherry. Okay.
Are you staying here tonight?

08:26.500 --> 08:30.733
-No, actually... like I said,
somebody was aggravating
the crap outta me,

08:30.767 --> 08:34.533
and um... somebody
is in room 322.
They just want me

08:34.567 --> 08:36.100
to give 'em a ride

08:36.133 --> 08:37.967
to the liquor store.
I don't even know where
that's at...

08:38.067 --> 08:39.567
-322?
-Yeah.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.700
-Well, this is 410 and 409.
-I know, I don't know
where it's at,

08:41.733 --> 08:43.600
so I parked right here
and I was about to walk...

08:43.633 --> 08:46.167
-Okay.
-but I couldn't use the phone
'cause... my boyfriend

08:46.200 --> 08:48.067
was blowin'-- blowin' me up.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.967
-Is anybody else in this car?
-No.

08:50.067 --> 08:53.067
-It's a pretty big nice van.
-This is your car, right?

08:53.067 --> 08:56.233
-Yeah.
-Okay. Come on over here,
for me.

08:56.267 --> 08:58.967
You can hang out with me.
Okay, is there anything
in that car

08:59.067 --> 09:01.133
you ain't supposed to have
that's gonna get you
in trouble?

09:01.167 --> 09:03.967
-No.
-No? Are you under the influence
of anything right now?

09:04.067 --> 09:07.700
-I been cryin'.
-You been cryin'?
What's you been cryin' for?

09:07.733 --> 09:11.667
-Life's stressful situations.
-I think everybody's
got those, right?

09:11.700 --> 09:13.900
-Yeah.
-Would you have any problem
with me takin' a look

09:13.933 --> 09:16.267
in your vehicle, make sure
you don't have any narcotics
in there?

09:16.300 --> 09:19.300
-No. Look.
-I can? Okay.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.333
And nothin' on you
you ain't supposed to have,
nothin' hidden...

09:22.367 --> 09:23.833
-No.
-on you?

09:23.867 --> 09:27.067
-Nothin' hidden
on me, no, nothin'.
-Nothin' in your wallet?

09:27.067 --> 09:31.100
In your little wallet thing?
-Uh-uh.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.567
-Can you open up
that little zipper for me?

09:34.867 --> 09:37.333
-What's that?
-This is
a blood pressure pill.

09:37.367 --> 09:41.333
-Let me see what you got there.
-It's a hydrochloride...

09:41.367 --> 09:43.700
-Okay.
-For high blood pressure.

09:43.733 --> 09:46.500
-Okay. Do your arms
like this.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.667
-I'm not a druggie.
I don't shoot no needles
or nothin'.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.400
-Okay.
You just actin'
a little funny.

09:52.433 --> 09:55.133
Tell you what, will you
go hang out with Deputy Jones
back here?

09:55.167 --> 09:56.767
-'Cause y'all are scary...
-We're scary?

09:56.800 --> 10:00.100
-I was irritated (bleep).
You have no idea, like...
-What is there about me

10:00.133 --> 10:04.733
that makes you intimidated?
-Not you (indistinct).

10:04.767 --> 10:08.000
-(radio chatter)
-(indistinct) "Are you
with my boyfriend?"

10:08.033 --> 10:13.600
And that's why I turned around
right there and um...
they keep-- whoever, uh...

10:13.633 --> 10:15.800
-You don't know
who you're supposed
to pick up at the hotel?

10:15.833 --> 10:18.100
-I forget-- I forgot his name.

10:18.133 --> 10:21.033
Because he's a friend of mine's
friend, and he's the one
wants a ride to the liquor store

10:21.067 --> 10:24.033
before they close.
I told him there's one open
on (indistinct) Road,

10:24.067 --> 10:27.233
-'cause (indistinct) her life.
-Yeah, yeah. Hang tight here
with Deputy Jones, okay?

10:27.267 --> 10:31.000
-(radio chatter)
-We stopped a female
for a traffic violation.

10:31.033 --> 10:33.467
She didn't use a turn signal
when she pulled into here.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.000
When she got out,
she appears to be
under the influence

10:36.033 --> 10:40.000
of some kind of substance,
so we're gonna make sure
there's no kinda narcotic

10:40.033 --> 10:41.700
in her vehicle.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.200
It's a pill that's
not in a prescription bottle.

10:47.367 --> 10:51.333
There's a whole lot
more pills that are not
in an approved bottle.

10:53.067 --> 10:57.600
Deputy Justice is performing
the evaluations to see
if she was okay to drive,

10:57.633 --> 11:00.167
and as soon
as he finishes that,
we're gonna go talk to her.

11:00.200 --> 11:05.367
-So while searching,
Deputy Jones located
a folded up dollar bill,

11:05.400 --> 11:09.900
in a particular way
that's consistent
with narcotics,

11:09.933 --> 11:14.733
and inside
it appears there's gonna be...
looks like cocaine.

11:14.767 --> 11:17.300
We'll test it
and figure out
what it is.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.800
That was found up top, Ryan?

11:18.833 --> 11:21.200
-Yeah, right up here,
tucked to the right.
-I seen her reachin'

11:21.233 --> 11:22.867
before she got out.
-Okay.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.133
So it's probably consistent
with what she was doin'.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.333
Let me go talk to her
real quick.

11:26.367 --> 11:28.200
Apparently while Justice
was doing SFST,

11:28.233 --> 11:30.067
she was about to fall asleep.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.767
-Earlier?
-You're under the influence
of a CNS depressant.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.267
-No, you can't
read me anything.
-Well, I have to...

11:37.300 --> 11:39.467
-I'm not
under the influence of...

11:39.500 --> 11:41.333
-Okay, but I have
to read you this, okay?

11:41.367 --> 11:43.333
-All right, ma'am...
-No, I have not
had a drink yet.

11:43.367 --> 11:44.967
-Have a seat, ma'am.
No, you ain't been drinkin',

11:45.067 --> 11:47.600
but you been takin'...
-I have not been takin'...

11:47.633 --> 11:51.667
anything, I haven't slept
in like three days.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.200
-Look here, you said
I could search
your vehicle, correct?

11:54.233 --> 11:56.367
Do you wanna talk
about some of the stuff
I found in your vehicle?

11:56.400 --> 11:59.500
-Well, no, first of all,
because, no, I don't recall
sayin' I gave you a right

11:59.533 --> 12:02.767
to search my whole vehicle.
You said is there anything
in there that I might

12:02.800 --> 12:06.367
know about, or...
-No, that's correct,
I did ask you that.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.567
You said, yes I can search.
-No, not search
the whole thing...

12:10.600 --> 12:13.467
-Okay, so when I asked
if I could search,
you meant if I can search

12:13.500 --> 12:16.500
like one portion of it,
that what the understanding
you were in, or...

12:16.533 --> 12:21.767
-Yeah, like, look in there
and there's no... alcohol.
-Okay. Okay.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.100
-First off, do you wanna
talk about what I found
in the vehicle?

12:25.133 --> 12:26.933
That's a yes or a no, ma'am.

12:26.967 --> 12:30.767
Okay, well, what I found
is I found about half a gram
of powder cocaine

12:30.800 --> 12:33.700
in a dollar bill wrapped up
above your driver's seat, okay?

12:33.733 --> 12:36.500
And also... yes, ma'am.
And also, I found...

12:36.533 --> 12:39.567
-Do you wanna weigh that up?
So I'll see?
-Okay, it may not

12:39.600 --> 12:41.067
be half a gram,
it's probably...
-Thank you.

12:41.067 --> 12:44.233
-Probably... point-two grams.
-Nothin'... yeah...

12:44.267 --> 12:46.700
-It's a felony.
Regardless of--
-Point-one?

12:46.733 --> 12:48.767
-Okay, we can argue
numbers all night,
but I'm tellin' you

12:48.800 --> 12:52.667
it's a felony to have it.
-That's actually good.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.367
-Well, it tested positive
for cocaine.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.333
-Okay.
-On top of the cocaine
there was a bottle

12:57.367 --> 12:59.133
which had several different
pills in there, which is--

12:59.167 --> 13:03.167
-That's clonazepam for uh...
-Okay, do you
have a prescription for that?

13:03.200 --> 13:06.967
-No, however,
my caseworker knows
that I'm taking those

13:07.067 --> 13:09.367
to keep my nerves calm.
-Okay, you know you have
to have a prescription

13:09.400 --> 13:12.533
for that.
-I thought y'all just
gave tickets for (bleep).

13:12.567 --> 13:14.400
-No, ma'am, not-- not
felonies we don't.

13:14.433 --> 13:15.600
Do you wanna get help?

13:15.633 --> 13:17.533
-You gotta be able
to help yourself.
-Of course.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.567
-Are you willing
to help yourself?
-Yes.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.200
-Okay.
-I've already started.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.533
-Y'all the wrong angels
I was askin' to come
and save me.

13:23.567 --> 13:26.067
-Well, sometimes,
people need to go to jail
to get help.

13:30.067 --> 13:33.933
-I've been a police officer
at Amarillo PD
for five years now.

13:33.967 --> 13:37.233
One thing I've noticed
even from my time
in the academy,

13:37.267 --> 13:39.500
all the way up
until today

13:39.533 --> 13:41.433
is that people have always
been real supportive of us

13:41.467 --> 13:42.767
here in the town.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.867
You know, these people
don't just say hi and give you

13:44.900 --> 13:46.233
your typical thank you,

13:46.267 --> 13:48.233
they take the time to come out,
and they shake your hand.

13:48.267 --> 13:51.500
It makes coming to work
a lot less stressful.

13:51.533 --> 13:54.200
It's just a blessing
to have that support.

13:54.233 --> 13:57.533
I see a vehicle up here
just ahead of us.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.500
Noticed the back lights
aren't on.

13:59.533 --> 14:01.600
That's kind of a safety issue.

14:01.633 --> 14:05.233
Given the time of night,
you know, we can go ahead
and pull the driver over,

14:05.267 --> 14:06.900
and make him aware
of the offense.

14:19.933 --> 14:21.200
Hello, sir, how are you doin'?

14:21.233 --> 14:23.133
My name is Officer Gaitan
with Amarillo Police Department.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.200
The reason I pulled you over
is you don't have
any back lights.

14:25.233 --> 14:26.500
-There's no back lights.
-Huh?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.667
-There's no--
-They just put a system in.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.200
-Okay, who's all in the vehicle
with you?

14:30.233 --> 14:31.400
What's your name?
-Marcos.

14:31.433 --> 14:32.667
-Marcos what?

14:32.700 --> 14:34.500
-And yours?
-Freddie.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.200
-Huh?
-Freddie.

14:36.233 --> 14:37.733
-Would you mind steppin'
outside the vehicle

14:37.767 --> 14:41.567
for me, man?
-(radio chatter)

14:41.600 --> 14:44.967
-Step back here.
What did you say your name
is again?

14:45.067 --> 14:47.333
-Freddie? Could you put
your hands up there for me?

14:47.367 --> 14:49.067
Do you got anything on you--
-Oh, no, no, I don't.

14:49.067 --> 14:51.067
-All right, man, the reason
I'm having you step outside
the car

14:51.100 --> 14:53.100
is 'cause
you're acting kinda nervous.
-No, I was getting my--

14:53.133 --> 14:54.967
my phone.
-I understand, don't--
don't reach for anything

14:55.067 --> 14:56.433
like that, okay, bro?
-All right, all right.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.933
-42. Start me another unit.
It's occupied three times.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.533
-Who's vehicle
is this you have?
-I don't know.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.533
-You don't know
who's vehicle that is?
-I was just driving.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.767
-Do you got any warrants
that you know about, Freddie?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.700
-Uh, probably tickets.
-Probably tickets?

15:06.733 --> 15:08.667
-Yeah.
-All right, man. All right.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.900
Come back here with me,
have a seat in my car.

15:10.933 --> 15:12.633
I'm not gonna put you
in handcuffs or anything.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.400
-Okay.
-But you're not free
to go, okay?

15:14.433 --> 15:16.933
Yeah... come on, we can't--
we can't get back over here.

15:16.967 --> 15:18.800
Can we put him in the back
of your car?

15:18.833 --> 15:21.200
-Sure.
-He's being cool and every--
he's not handcuffed

15:21.233 --> 15:24.167
or anything.
Hey, will you run him?

15:24.200 --> 15:26.300
She in there?
-Yeah.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.100
-Hey, you mind
steppin' outside for me, bud?

15:29.133 --> 15:31.767
-Anyway we could
get a verbal warning
or a certificate or something?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.367
-Huh? Uh, we'll deal with that
here in a second.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.633
Come over here to the front
of my car.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.667
What's your name?
-Marco.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.133
-Marco?
Front of the vehicle, okay?

15:37.167 --> 15:38.967
Keep-- Put your hands
on the bar.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.567
Do you have anything on you
you're not supposed to have,
anything like that, Marco?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.767
Okay, the reason
I'm kinda worried
is 'cause I pulled Freddie over.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.467
He's kinda nervous,
kinda acting kinda weird.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.200
And uh, he says he doesn't know
who's the vehicle is.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.400
Is the vehicle your vehicle?
-No.

15:50.433 --> 15:51.933
-Is that her vehicle
in the front?

15:51.967 --> 15:53.967
-No.
-Does anybody know
who's vehicle it is?

15:54.067 --> 15:56.067
-Mm, I'm not sure who's it is.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.533
-Okay, man, do you understand
how that can be kinda suspicious
to me?

15:58.567 --> 16:00.767
-Yeah, but man,
the taillight's out.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.267
Most of the time
you get a ticket for that...

16:02.300 --> 16:04.467
-I mean,
most of the time, okay.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.700
-Hey... go secure that guy
in the back of my car.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.500
I seen a baggie on the floor
board, I think he dropped
a baggie of dope.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.767
-All right.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.500
Do me a favor? Turn around
and face that way real quick?

16:12.533 --> 16:14.200
-What happened?
-Just turn around
and face that way.

16:14.233 --> 16:15.567
-Oh, no.
-Put your hands
behind your back.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.300
You're gonna be detained, okay?
-What are you doin'?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.300
Just hang tight.
Let me get you detained first.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.733
-What is that for?
-I'll tell you here
in just a second,

16:21.767 --> 16:23.133
all right, Marcos?

16:23.167 --> 16:25.367
-Just work with me
and be cool, and we'll go
from there, okay?

16:25.400 --> 16:28.600
-Will you give me
a chance here?
-Just hang tight, Marcos.

16:28.633 --> 16:31.333
-One time?
-(radio chatter)

16:31.367 --> 16:33.867
-All right, let's come over
here to this car--
-Will you put him in your car?

16:33.900 --> 16:36.367
-Walk this way. You ever
been stopped by us before?

16:36.400 --> 16:38.100
Ever been in trouble
with the law?

16:38.133 --> 16:40.067
-Uh, yeah, I have.
-All right, man.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.567
-(indistinct)
Yeah, he's cuffed
and everything.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.067
They're double-locked already.

16:43.067 --> 16:45.600
-Let it slide this time?
-Marcos, just work
with Officer Fenwick.

16:45.633 --> 16:47.133
-(radio chatter)

16:47.167 --> 16:50.333
-Yeah, after he got out,
and I was talking
to the front seat passenger,

16:50.367 --> 16:54.067
I saw a little baggie
in the side, off right there.
-Yeah, just...

16:54.100 --> 16:57.067
-We found quarter bags
like that when they got dope
on 'em, so...

16:57.067 --> 17:00.067
Based on me seein' that,
I think it's dope,
it's sittin' in plain view,

17:00.100 --> 17:01.767
and I'm talkin'
to the passengers, so...

17:01.800 --> 17:04.800
The back passenger
was also pretty apprehensive
when speaking with us.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.900
He's askin' a lot
of questions, very nervous,

17:06.933 --> 17:10.433
and we're gonna see
what this is right now.

17:10.467 --> 17:13.433
So we'll take this back
over here to the front
of my patrol unit.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.100
Take a look at it.

17:16.133 --> 17:20.367
Feels like it's, uh,
kinda hard, and uh,
crystal-like.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.767
It's uh...

17:21.800 --> 17:23.833
-Looks like
it's crystal meth.
-It looks like it's uh...

17:23.867 --> 17:26.500
crystal methamphetamine.

17:26.533 --> 17:29.700
Let's go ahead and test this
for uh, methamphetamines.

17:30.867 --> 17:35.933
Get a piece... just a small,
small one.

17:38.533 --> 17:40.933
-Positive.

17:40.967 --> 17:45.667
-I'll take a look at this.
-See, it turned orange
right there.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.833
-Looks like
that's a good hit.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.900
Orange hit's positive
for methamphetamines.

17:52.133 --> 17:55.133
-We found a small baggie
behind your seat, Freddie.

17:55.167 --> 17:58.067
Hang-- Hang tight,
let me explain myself.
-But he--

17:58.067 --> 18:01.067
-Given-- Given-- Like I said,
I saw you makin' all these
movements and stuff like that--

18:01.067 --> 18:02.700
-No, officer, I was gettin'
my phone...
-Okay, okay.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.167
Let me talk, Freddie.
Let me explain myself.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.800
I'm not accusing you
of saying or doing anything.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.867
-Man, he better own up
to that, man.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.867
-Okay. Like I said, man...
-That's not even right.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.267
-What do you think--
what do you think I found
on the back seat?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.867
-He had a baggie of...
ice, I think.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.867
-Baggie of ice?
What'd the baggie of ice
look like?

18:17.900 --> 18:19.500
-I don't know, he just said
he had some.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.367
-Who said he had some?
-Him.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.067
-What's his name?
-Marcus.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.567
-Marcus? Okay.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.067
-So you actually saw Marcos
throw that back there?

18:28.067 --> 18:30.200
-Well, I didn't see--
actually see him,
but I mean, he-- I seen him

18:30.233 --> 18:31.967
lean over the seat,
and he was-- you know,

18:32.067 --> 18:34.400
he was doin' somethin',
he'd get it in his pockets
and stuff, and that...

18:34.433 --> 18:36.267
-What pocket
was he gettin' into?
-Into his right pocket.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.733
-Front right pocket?
-Yeah. And I was askin' him,
what was he doin',

18:38.767 --> 18:40.067
and he said "Nothin',
nothin', nothin'."

18:40.100 --> 18:41.500
-Okay.
-I mean, it's pretty obvious.

18:41.533 --> 18:43.133
-All right.
Have a seat back here.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.433
And we'll-- we'll go
from there, okay?

18:48.333 --> 18:53.233
All right, here's the deal,
Marcos. Um... y'know,
based off everything I got,

18:53.267 --> 18:57.700
after my investigation,
with the cooperation of uh,
Freddie and Sarah,

18:57.733 --> 18:59.800
you're gonna be charged
with, uh, possession
of methamphetamine.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.367
-How? If it's not on me
and it wasn't mine?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.333
-And I got both of them
saying it was you.

19:03.367 --> 19:05.533
-Can you prove it?
-Huh?

19:05.567 --> 19:09.467
-Can you prove it's mine?
-I-- I got-- I got two
statements from them, man.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.400
I'm not making this stuff up.
I'm just tellin' you,
these are what your friends

19:12.433 --> 19:14.733
are tellin' me.
-How come you're not listenin'
to what I'm tellin' you?

19:14.767 --> 19:16.400
-Huh?
-How come you're not listening
to what I say?

19:16.433 --> 19:17.933
-I am, man. I've heard your side
of the story.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.733
That's why I allowed you
and read you your rights.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.567
But based off of what
I have in my investigation,

19:22.600 --> 19:25.133
that's what leads me
to believe that you
were in the possession--

19:25.167 --> 19:27.567
-Was it on me?
-No, but, they're both sayin'
it was you, bro.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.667
-Damn. That's messed up.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.100
-I know, man.
I guess you just
have to try to work

19:32.133 --> 19:33.933
with better friends
or do somethin', man.

19:33.967 --> 19:37.300
-Oh, man. Y'all can't
just say he said, she said
and just go off from that.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.900
-Well, that'll be on y'all
to fix that up
at a different time,

19:39.933 --> 19:41.767
but right now,
you're bein'...
-I'm not gonna get charges

19:41.800 --> 19:45.333
just based on something
that someone said.

19:45.367 --> 19:48.167
-Sounds to me like
there's some bridges
that have been burned, man.

19:50.700 --> 19:53.433
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:53.467 --> 19:55.400
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:55.433 --> 19:56.567
Cover is code three.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.567
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.267 --> 20:08.433
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:08.467 --> 20:12.200
-(theme music playing)
