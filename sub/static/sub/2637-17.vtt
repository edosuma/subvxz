That's what you did.

00:19.269 --> 00:23.564
I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.316
- Well, it's not.
- Why am I supposed to know that?

00:26.484 --> 00:29.987
As teacher, it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies...

00:30.155 --> 00:31.613
...from the subject matter.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.950
- I'm glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
- Why?

Why are you learning Chinese?

00:54.721 --> 00:57.848
I believe the Szechuan Palace

00:58.016 --> 01:01.185
...as tangerine chicken,
and I intend to confront them.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.898

about what they're passing off as chicken.

- Okay, feel better, bye.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.274
She doesn't wanna talk.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.776
Not surprising.

02:32.944 --> 02:37.406
Penny's emotional responses originate in the
primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.

in the recently developed neocortex.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.188
What else?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.982
It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship on his blog...

Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.

- Normal non-freaky smart.
- Yeah, no, sure.

with the cushion densities...

13:03.073 --> 13:07.118
...air-flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

13:07.286 --> 13:11.039
Why don't you pick at random, if you
don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.208
No, no, that's crazy.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.046
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

13:18.923 --> 13:19.964
Okay.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.467
Here's the thing.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.971
So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had a little crush on me...

13:27.139 --> 13:28.890
A little crush?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.475
Well, I suppose so.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.479
In the same way Menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.357
I don't really know who they are...

13:37.525 --> 13:40.902
- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
- Yeah, I don't care. Listen.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.737
The point is...

13:42.905 --> 13:45.657
...Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.285
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.081
Would you be open
to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

13:53.249 --> 13:57.710
No. What I'm saying is,
Leonard might be different in a good way.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.256
And obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

14:01.423 --> 14:05.593
Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.222
Oh, glare.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.765
But on the other hand...

14:10.933 --> 14:14.435
...if things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.354
I mean, he's not looking for a fling.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.483
He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for, like you would say, light-years.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.776
I would not say that.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.573
No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance, not time.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.783
Thank you for the clarification.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.584
Draft.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.337
You see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

14:41.505 --> 14:45.049
Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.384
Right. Thanks.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.013
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.723
Okay.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.018
I think this will be my seat.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.854
Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do...

14:58.022 --> 15:00.064
...with, you know,
what I'm talking about?

15:00.816 --> 15:02.650
Well, let's see.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.153
We might consider Schrödinger's cat.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.406
Schrödinger. Is that the woman in 2A?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.824
No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.494
She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican
hairless. Annoying little animal. Yip-yip-yip.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.163
Sheldon.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.665
Sorry, you diverted me.

15:17.833 --> 15:22.253
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrödinger,
in an attempt to explain...

15:22.421 --> 15:26.090
...the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
physics, he proposed an experiment.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.886
A cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison...

15:30.054 --> 15:31.971
...that will break open at a random time.

15:32.139 --> 15:35.934
Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released...

15:36.101 --> 15:41.606
...until the box is opened, the cat
can be thought of as both alive and dead.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.196
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.407
Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.161
You have to be psychic,
there's no such thing...

15:55.329 --> 15:56.871
Sheldon, what's the point?

15:57.039 --> 16:00.708
Just like Schrödinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard...

16:00.876 --> 16:03.544
...right now
can be thought of as both good and bad.

16:03.712 --> 16:07.674
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.386
Okay, so you're saying
I should go out with Leonard?

16:11.553 --> 16:13.554
No, no, no.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.142
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger...

16:20.688 --> 16:22.355
Two seats right there.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.693
[SPEAKING IN MANDARIN]

16:34.159 --> 16:36.077
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.621
I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon...

16:38.789 --> 16:42.917
...choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.836
No, it's about Penny.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.797
A mistake involving Penny.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.008
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.219
I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.721
Then don't.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.223
Other people would say, "Why not?"

16:57.391 --> 16:59.600
Other people might be interested.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.980
- I'm gonna talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

17:05.107 --> 17:09.569
Now that I'm actually about to go out
with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.529
Then your meal choice is appropriate.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.780
Starch absorbs fluid...

17:12.948 --> 17:16.576
...which reduces the amount
of vomit available for violent expulsion.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.619
- Right.
- You also made a grammatical mistake.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.205
You said "nauseous"
when you meant "nauseated."

17:23.459 --> 17:24.876
But go on.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.128
Sheldon, this date
is probably my one chance with Penny.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.630
What happens if I blow it?

17:30.466 --> 17:34.677
Well, if we accept your premise and also
accept the highly improbable assumption...

17:34.845 --> 17:37.430
...that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you...

17:37.598 --> 17:40.391
...we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it...

17:40.559 --> 17:43.811
...would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.397
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers...

17:46.565 --> 17:48.900
...from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.985
You're not helping.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.945
All right, what response on my part...

17:53.113 --> 17:55.406
...would bring this conversation
to a conclusion?

17:55.574 --> 17:58.159
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.744
Schrödinger's cat.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.955
Wow, that's brilliant.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.750

Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

18:45.874 --> 18:47.333
Maybe we should talk first.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.377
Oh.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.711
Okay.

18:52.214 --> 18:56.050
But before you say anything,
have you ever heard of Schrödinger's cat?

18:58.220 --> 19:02.140
Actually, I've heard
far too much about Schrödinger's cat.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.433
Good.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.317
All right, the cat's alive.
