TINA: Hey, I was watching that.

00:51.345 --> 00:53.530
Bad enough I'm being forced
to go to their concert.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.365
It's like I'm going
to the electric chair

00:55.366 --> 00:57.567
and you're making me watch
videos of the electric chair.

00:57.568 --> 00:59.068
Louise, you be nice.

00:59.069 --> 01:00.587
Your Aunt Gayle got you
those tickets

01:00.588 --> 01:01.855
and she's excited to take you.

01:01.889 --> 01:03.556
I'm super excited.

01:03.557 --> 01:05.391
I've been practicing
my concert scream all week.

01:05.391 --> 01:07.227
(weakly): Ah...

01:07.228 --> 01:09.529
Ah... Still ne...
might need some work.

01:09.530 --> 01:12.432
Why would you waste a scream
on a stupid boy band?

01:12.433 --> 01:14.100
Screams are for roller coasters

01:14.101 --> 01:16.469
or axe murderers
or Dad's morning breath.

01:16.470 --> 01:17.754
Hey, it's not that bad.

01:17.755 --> 01:19.122
(screams) Oh, whew!

01:19.156 --> 01:21.090
Brush your teeth.
I did.

01:21.091 --> 01:22.475
Well, then,
help me look for my keys.

01:22.476 --> 01:23.576
I've told you to stop
putting stuff in there

01:23.577 --> 01:24.584
if you ever want to see it again.

01:24.612 --> 01:26.112
You put my baby brother in there

01:26.113 --> 01:28.114
and that was the last
we saw of him!

01:28.115 --> 01:30.683
Javier Belcher, I love you!

01:30.718 --> 01:32.602
I'm serious.
We're gonna be late

01:32.603 --> 01:33.820
for Gene's table-setting
competition.

01:33.821 --> 01:35.288
Ugh.
Do I really have to?

01:35.289 --> 01:37.023
I-I'd rather go to
the boy band concert.

01:37.057 --> 01:40.326
Bob, one of our kids is actually
participating in something.

01:40.327 --> 01:42.362
We're going,
even if it's table-setting.

01:42.396 --> 01:44.247
It's table-scaping.

01:44.248 --> 01:46.983
And it's the most exciting
competition on four legs.

01:47.017 --> 01:49.152
It combines accurate
table-setting placement

01:49.153 --> 01:51.104
with creative themes and costumes.

01:51.105 --> 01:53.523
I'm sure it's much more exciting
than it sounds.

01:53.524 --> 01:55.258
It has to be. Right?

01:55.259 --> 01:56.910
Gene, how did you even end up going

01:56.911 --> 01:58.551
to the regionals
in table-setting, anyway?

01:59.680 --> 02:00.997
<i>It was the only non-athletic</i>

02:01.031 --> 02:02.432
<i>after-school activity,</i>

02:02.433 --> 02:03.833
<i>and I creamed the competition.</i>

02:03.868 --> 02:05.502
As you can see,

02:05.503 --> 02:08.170
my tablecloth is a trash bag.
Mm-hmm.

02:08.205 --> 02:11.174
Please enjoy this gar-beverage.
Amusing.

02:11.175 --> 02:12.709
And when the meal is over,

02:12.710 --> 02:15.278
you can deposit your dirty
silverware in the truck

02:15.279 --> 02:16.613
to head to the dump.

02:16.614 --> 02:17.847
Beep! Beep!

02:17.848 --> 02:19.649
(imitates whirring hydraulics)

02:19.683 --> 02:22.051
Our theme is twin dinner.
Twinner!

02:22.052 --> 02:23.319
Two knives.
Two forks.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.519
Two napkins.

02:24.538 --> 02:25.972
Two plates...
Congratulations, Gene.

02:25.973 --> 02:27.140
You're going to regionals.

02:27.174 --> 02:28.708
All right!

02:28.709 --> 02:29.742
Mmm.

02:29.743 --> 02:31.344
Gene, if you like
setting tables so much,

02:31.345 --> 02:33.112
why don't you set tables
at the restaurant?

02:33.113 --> 02:34.321
Or here?

02:34.348 --> 02:35.715
(chuckles) No, Dad.

02:35.716 --> 02:37.116
I don't set where I eat.

02:38.519 --> 02:39.659
Where's Aunt Gayle?

02:39.687 --> 02:41.120
It's my first concert.

02:41.121 --> 02:42.355
I want to hurry up
and start remembering

02:42.356 --> 02:43.663
this moment for
the rest of my life.

02:43.691 --> 02:44.958
Maybe Aunt Gayle realized

02:44.959 --> 02:46.292
that she's a 42-yeldaroman

02:46.293 --> 02:47.760
and she shouldn't be
into boy bands?

02:47.795 --> 02:48.945
(phone rings)

02:48.979 --> 02:50.246
Hello?

02:50.247 --> 02:52.715
(exhales) Hi, Aunt Gayle.
Are you outside?

02:52.716 --> 02:54.083
An emergency?

02:54.084 --> 02:55.351
Emergency?

02:55.352 --> 02:56.586
Okay, yeah...

02:56.587 --> 02:58.171
I-I understand.
Bye.

02:58.172 --> 03:00.206
Give me the bad news.
Give me the bad news!

03:00.207 --> 03:01.741
Aunt Gayle pepper-sprayed
one of her cats

03:01.742 --> 03:03.142
because she thought
he was an intruder

03:03.143 --> 03:04.911
trying to sexually assault her.

03:04.912 --> 03:07.931
She has to take him to the vet
and we have to miss the concert.

03:07.932 --> 03:09.399
Yeah!

03:09.433 --> 03:11.401
This is the best thing
Aunt Gayle's done

03:11.402 --> 03:14.237
since she pooped her pants at
the cell phone store last year.

03:14.271 --> 03:16.072
Ugh, my heart
just pooped its pants.

03:16.073 --> 03:17.340
(makes farting sound)

03:18.943 --> 03:21.344
Wow. Lots of people.

03:21.378 --> 03:22.545
I didn't realize that table-setting

03:22.546 --> 03:23.763
was such a big deal.
'Scaping!

03:23.764 --> 03:25.448
Check out those trophies.

03:25.449 --> 03:28.468
LINDA: Ooh, and judges
with buttons that say "judge."

03:28.502 --> 03:31.070
Well, got to get cracking
if I'm gonna win first place.

03:31.071 --> 03:33.339
You know, honey,
it's okay if you don't win.

03:33.340 --> 03:36.192
Yeah, Gene, I mean, win or lose,
we're just proud that...

03:36.193 --> 03:38.861
you're setting a table
at the competitive level.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.763
Ooh, mini croissants!

03:40.764 --> 03:43.566
No matter what I say,
stop me when I've had 16.

03:43.601 --> 03:46.386
(hums) So, now that we're not
going to the concert,

03:46.387 --> 03:47.620
what should we do first?

03:47.621 --> 03:50.189
(groans)

03:50.190 --> 03:51.991
All right, I'll give it a shot.

03:52.026 --> 03:54.961
(groaning) (Tina groaning)

03:54.962 --> 03:56.613
(groans) Is this it?

03:56.614 --> 03:57.780
Yeah, that's good.

03:57.781 --> 03:59.282
(both groaning)

03:59.283 --> 04:00.615
Okay! I hate this.

04:00.618 --> 04:02.151
Come on, Tina, cheer up.

04:02.152 --> 04:04.053
It's four lame boys who dance.

04:04.054 --> 04:05.922
There's so much more
out there in the world.

04:05.923 --> 04:07.156
No, there isn't!

04:07.157 --> 04:08.725
Ugh, it's no fun having you down

04:08.726 --> 04:10.627
if I'm not the one
who got you there.

04:10.628 --> 04:11.894
(sadly): I'm sorry.

04:11.895 --> 04:13.129
Fine. I'm not a monster.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.397
I'll help you.

04:14.398 --> 04:15.698
What do you mean?

04:15.733 --> 04:17.100
I mean I'll get you to the concert.

04:17.101 --> 04:19.435
- I'll get you there.
- How?

04:19.435 --> 04:21.321
Are you sure we can
bike all the way there

04:21.322 --> 04:22.905
by the time the concert starts?

04:22.906 --> 04:25.291
Not if we keep
chitchatting like this.

04:25.326 --> 04:26.409
Oh, here's the freeway.

04:26.443 --> 04:28.878
Once we merge, get in
the fast lane, okay?

04:28.912 --> 04:30.296
And we'll get there in no time.

04:30.331 --> 04:31.597
(moans) What?

04:31.598 --> 04:32.832
(moans)

04:32.833 --> 04:34.367
(tires squeal)

04:34.401 --> 04:35.442
(coughs)

04:35.469 --> 04:37.520
TINA: Zeke?
What are you doing here?

04:37.521 --> 04:39.288
Me and my cousin Leslie
are going to sell

04:39.289 --> 04:41.107
some bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs

04:41.108 --> 04:42.449
at the Boyz 4 Now concert.

04:42.476 --> 04:43.826
Boom. Whatcha letcha.

04:43.827 --> 04:47.063
Ha! Check it out.
One size fits all.

04:47.097 --> 04:49.032
Damn, this one says my
card's declined, too.

04:49.033 --> 04:50.299
Zeke, you have any money?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.901
Nah, my white ass is broke.

04:51.935 --> 04:53.469
Hey, I've got gas money.

04:53.470 --> 04:55.104
You got room for two
more in that buggy?

04:55.139 --> 04:57.440
You slip me a fiver,
I'll be your driver.

04:57.441 --> 04:58.675
Leslie loves rhymes.

04:58.676 --> 05:00.376
And pasta that comes in cans.

05:00.377 --> 05:03.212
If it ain't from a can,
it don't go in this man.

05:03.213 --> 05:04.213
(laughs)

05:05.471 --> 05:07.667
I've never ridden with
this many hot dogs before.

05:07.668 --> 05:09.168
A day of firsts.

05:09.169 --> 05:11.003
Watch out. You squish 'em,
you bought 'em.

05:11.004 --> 05:12.288
TINA: <i>Boyz 4 Now, here we come.</i>

05:12.289 --> 05:13.750
ZEKE: <i>Don't squish it!</i>

05:15.357 --> 05:17.358
TINA: <i>So who's your favorite</i>
Boy 4 Now?

05:17.359 --> 05:19.860
Griffin's the hot one.
And he's super extreme.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.362
His dog is a wolf.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.663
Stop.
And then there's Allen.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.765
He's cute but shy.
His fans are called

05:24.799 --> 05:26.584
Allen-coholics.
Ugh.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.619
My stepmom's an Allen-coholic.
And a shopaholic.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.837
Double trouble!

05:29.871 --> 05:31.121
This is Matt.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.423
He's moody and a little older.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.624
I think, like, 17.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.010
LOUISE: Maybe his mustache is 17,
but he's 90.

05:36.011 --> 05:37.261
And then there's Boo Boo.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.446
He's young
but crazy good at dancing.

05:39.481 --> 05:41.298
I used to be a real
Boo Boo Booster,

05:41.299 --> 05:42.850
but now I'm kind of into Griffin.

05:42.851 --> 05:44.184
Ugh, stop talking!

05:44.185 --> 05:46.136
(mumbling) Stop. Stop.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.639
- Okay, I'm gonna put my fist in your mouth.
- (muffled): Okay.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.114
Oh, Marilyn.
Tragic beauty.

05:57.115 --> 05:59.116
(gasps) I love your son's table.

05:59.117 --> 06:00.250
Hi.

06:00.285 --> 06:01.819
Aw. Thank you.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.687
Magic. Hmm.

06:03.722 --> 06:05.356
Uh, what's "hmm"?

06:05.390 --> 06:07.124
Your table's cute.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.827
But only one person can
take home the Golden Plate.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.329
And we sure didn't come
to take home the Silver Spoon.

06:12.364 --> 06:14.365
Yeah, well, we ne...
neither did we.

06:14.366 --> 06:15.633
- Right.
- Yeah.

06:15.634 --> 06:16.850
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

06:16.885 --> 06:18.852
Oh, please.
Come on, Oscar.

06:18.853 --> 06:20.471
You've still got
a crying Joe DiMaggio

06:20.472 --> 06:21.972
to carve out of butter.

06:21.973 --> 06:23.590
- Bye, guys. Good luck.
- Don't talk to them!

06:23.591 --> 06:25.225
Gene, get back to
work on your table.

06:25.226 --> 06:26.760
You've got to win.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.063
I thought you said it was okay
if I didn't win.

06:29.064 --> 06:30.564
Well, that was before
we met that idiot.

06:30.565 --> 06:31.832
Now, chop-chop.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.500
Ooh, Dad, you got the fever!

06:33.501 --> 06:34.902
'Scaping fever!

06:34.903 --> 06:36.570
Whoo!
Can't escape the 'scape!

06:36.571 --> 06:37.905
Let's do this!
Yeah!

06:39.774 --> 06:42.576
(screaming, squealing)

06:42.610 --> 06:46.213
Ugh, no wonder no one likes women.

06:46.214 --> 06:48.115
All right, see you after the show.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.350
Be careful.

06:49.384 --> 06:51.251
There's a lot of puberty in there.

06:51.252 --> 06:52.920
I can't believe I'm here.
It's really happening.

06:52.921 --> 06:54.254
I feel light-headed.

06:54.255 --> 06:55.923
Whoa! No fainting!

06:55.924 --> 06:57.925
I don't think I'm strong
enough to go in there alone.

06:57.926 --> 06:59.193
I need you to come with me.

06:59.194 --> 07:00.894
(sighs) Fine.

07:00.895 --> 07:02.930
I'll get you to your seat
so you don't get trampled,

07:02.931 --> 07:04.765
but then I am out of there.

07:06.267 --> 07:08.686
(screaming, squealing)

07:08.687 --> 07:10.704
What is wrong with all of you?

07:10.705 --> 07:12.072
They're just boys!

07:12.073 --> 07:13.357
Boys? Where?

07:13.358 --> 07:15.492
(retches) Oh, come on.

07:15.527 --> 07:16.760
WOMAN: <i>Hello, young man.</i>

07:16.795 --> 07:18.529
What can you tell me
about your table?

07:18.530 --> 07:19.813
Oh, well...

07:19.814 --> 07:22.449
Wait, what's that behind your ear?

07:22.450 --> 07:23.951
Is this your place card?

07:23.952 --> 07:26.020
Oh! Oh, my!

07:26.054 --> 07:27.955
Now, please, take your seat.

07:27.956 --> 07:30.357
Allow me to put
your napkin on your lap.

07:30.375 --> 07:31.625
Ah...?

07:31.659 --> 07:33.327
Very clever.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.662
Oh, I seem to have
forgotten my centerpiece.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.930
Or did I?

07:36.931 --> 07:38.499
Eh?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.251
And what menu would you serve
with this setting?

07:41.286 --> 07:43.454
For the entrée,
you'll pull a roasted rabbit

07:43.455 --> 07:45.289
out of your top hat plate.

07:45.290 --> 07:48.258
Served with
abracadab-braised potatoes

07:48.259 --> 07:50.928
and ice cream shazamwiches
for dessert!

07:50.929 --> 07:51.929
Oh!

07:51.930 --> 07:52.963
She's smiling.

07:52.964 --> 07:54.131
I think it's going well.

07:54.165 --> 07:56.133
He looks good.
He looks loose.

07:56.134 --> 07:58.502
I'm pleased to announce
our four finalists:

07:58.503 --> 08:00.738
Melissa Brown, Oscar Anthony...

08:00.772 --> 08:02.273
I did it! I did it!

08:02.307 --> 08:03.640
...Heather Smith

08:03.641 --> 08:05.058
and Gene Belcher.

08:05.076 --> 08:06.960
- Yay!
- Yay!

08:06.961 --> 08:08.545
Wait, why are there four winners?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.514
Finalists, please report
to your table

08:10.515 --> 08:13.283
and begin assembling
your second original display.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.518
Second display?

08:14.519 --> 08:16.086
If you thought
our first table was good,

08:16.087 --> 08:17.654
which you did...
No, we didn't.

08:17.655 --> 08:19.590
...just wait until
you see our second one.

08:19.591 --> 08:21.458
I don't want to give anything away,

08:21.459 --> 08:24.661
but we're about to take a
rocket ship out of this world.

08:24.696 --> 08:27.197
So it's space-themed?
I can't say.

08:27.198 --> 08:29.116
Well, it is.
You just basically said it.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.351
- I'll never tell.
- Plus, I didn't think your first table was good.

08:31.352 --> 08:33.953
I graciously disrespect
your answer.

08:33.988 --> 08:35.688
Well, wait till you see
what we got, okay?

08:35.722 --> 08:37.006
I'm busy then.
Well, you're gonna have

08:37.008 --> 08:38.107
to look at it if you're here.

08:38.109 --> 08:39.860
(chuckles) I'm double-parked.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.128
Okay, finalists.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.514
On your mark, get set, set.

08:43.548 --> 08:45.449
All right, Gene, what have you got?

08:45.450 --> 08:47.885
It better be bigger and more
impressive than outer space.

08:47.886 --> 08:49.653
Or Marilyn in space.
Marilyn in space.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.422
I didn't know there was
supposed to be a second display.

08:52.457 --> 08:53.524
- What?!
- Uh...

08:53.558 --> 08:54.658
Did you read the rules, Gene?

08:54.692 --> 08:56.477
No! There were 16 pages.

08:56.478 --> 08:59.363
I only got up to the part
that said no open-toed shoes.

08:59.397 --> 09:01.398
What are we gonna do?
We can't lose.

09:01.399 --> 09:04.401
We've come too far.
Come too far? Come too far?!

09:04.402 --> 09:07.421
We haven't come too far, Lin!
We're just getting started!

09:07.422 --> 09:10.090
- Okay, so what are we gonna do?!
- Why am I talking like this?!

09:10.091 --> 09:12.209
- I don't know! Why am I tal...
- I think I'm excited!

09:12.210 --> 09:14.578
- Oh, God!
- This is weird! We got to win it!

09:14.579 --> 09:16.063
- Let's win it!
- (gasps) What?

09:16.064 --> 09:18.982
I'm wearing open-toed shoes.
Ah, shoot.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.717

09:20.752 --> 09:24.204

09:24.205 --> 09:26.406
Okay, Teen, I think you're all set.

09:26.407 --> 09:28.408
Um, I'm gonna get out of here.

09:28.409 --> 09:30.410
So, I'll see you later,
okay, buddy?

09:30.411 --> 09:32.613

Next!

12:11.669 --> 12:13.069
Tell me more.
What about Boo Boo?

12:13.070 --> 12:14.337
Boo Boo's the youngest.

12:14.338 --> 12:15.922
And he's got a really great voice,

12:15.923 --> 12:17.963
but he hasn't hit puberty yet,
so that could change.

12:17.975 --> 12:20.059
What's he into? Sports?
I could get into sports.

12:20.060 --> 12:21.561

What?! No, Tina, that's...

12:26.851 --> 12:28.735
Okay, right, like, I like a boy.

12:28.736 --> 12:31.321
That's... Ugh!
Do you think he might like me?

12:31.322 --> 12:33.239
Oh, my God, what's happened to me?!

12:33.240 --> 12:35.441
Cut me open! I'm infected!
Pull it out!

12:35.442 --> 12:37.894
It's okay, Louise.
You're just having a crush.

Never! Boo Boo!

12:46.754 --> 12:48.504
Nothing. Everything.
I don't know.

12:48.505 --> 12:49.539
Do you like his hair?

12:49.540 --> 12:51.090
You mean those soft blond bangs

12:51.091 --> 12:53.176
you want to hide under
like an umbrella on a rainy day?

12:53.227 --> 12:54.794
No, not really.

12:54.795 --> 12:56.179
And his face?

12:56.213 --> 12:57.513
Ew, gross, it's so gorgeous!

12:57.514 --> 12:59.399
I just want to slap it.
I want to slap it.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.101
I just want to slap
his hideous, beautiful face.

13:02.135 --> 13:03.853
Um, you mean kiss?

13:03.854 --> 13:05.188
No, I mean slap.

13:05.189 --> 13:06.823
Whoa. You got it bad, girl.

13:06.857 --> 13:08.057
LINDA: <i>Okay, I read the rules.</i>

13:08.092 --> 13:09.325
It says here you can use anything

13:09.360 --> 13:11.611
you brought with you.
So brainstorm. Go.

13:11.645 --> 13:13.613
Hmm... hmm-hmm-hmm.
Oh, I got it!

13:13.614 --> 13:16.282
We could shave Dad,
glue his hair to the table,

13:16.283 --> 13:17.951
and the theme could be
"That's Nasty."

13:17.952 --> 13:19.385
Let's steal another kid's display.

13:19.386 --> 13:20.737
What?! Bob, no.

13:20.738 --> 13:22.722
Okay, not that.
We don't have to cheat.

13:22.723 --> 13:24.724
But we have to win,
by probably not cheating.

13:24.758 --> 13:26.426
Oh, ew, Bob, your breath.
Take a mint.

13:26.427 --> 13:28.394
You can smell it all
the way over there?

13:28.395 --> 13:30.563
I don't know what's wrong
with me. Maybe I'm dying.

13:30.564 --> 13:31.998
That's it! Mom's purse.
Dump it out!

13:31.999 --> 13:33.266
Yeah, Lin, there's got to be

13:33.267 --> 13:34.801
all sorts of stuff in there.

13:34.802 --> 13:36.552
- Let's take a look.
- All right, dump it.

13:36.604 --> 13:38.818
GENE: That's where all
my wadded tissues went.

13:38.822 --> 13:40.623
Start making piles of stuff

13:40.624 --> 13:42.558
Eh... okay, I got one.

13:42.593 --> 13:45.261
Lipstick, pepper spray,
tiny bag of carrots.

13:45.296 --> 13:46.345
What's the theme?

13:46.346 --> 13:47.947
Uh, "Woman of the Night."

13:47.982 --> 13:50.900
She gets dressed up, she kills
a john, she has a snack.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.869
Uh, let's keep making piles.

14:19.346 --> 14:20.563

have backstage passes.

14:20.597 --> 14:21.681
Uh, let's go do that.

14:21.682 --> 14:23.382
But we don't have passes.

14:34.295 --> 14:35.962

It only gets worse.

Don't get older.

14:46.340 --> 14:48.930
Hot dogs. No, no, wait.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.626
Oh, yep, yep, this one's hot.

14:50.627 --> 14:52.328

14:52.329 --> 14:53.663
Where's Leslie?

14:53.697 --> 14:55.415
He's using his shirt money to buy

14:55.416 --> 14:57.750
an endangered box turtle
from the tour bus driver.

14:57.751 --> 14:59.419
Tour bus?

14:59.420 --> 15:01.304
But whatever you do, don't
feed him after midnight.

15:01.305 --> 15:03.006
Just kidding. He doesn't
know what time it is.

15:03.007 --> 15:04.073
What is he, wearing a watch?

15:04.074 --> 15:05.308
Hey, cuz.

15:05.342 --> 15:07.176
Look who just joined the family.

15:07.177 --> 15:09.679
He lives in a shell
and he's cute as hell.

15:09.713 --> 15:11.080
Cool.

15:11.081 --> 15:13.316
Hey, bus driver, what other
endangered animals you got in there?

15:13.350 --> 15:14.917
Well, I got an African egg frog.

15:14.918 --> 15:16.285
I got a horseshoe bat.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.543
Got a skink and a skunk.
Got a bush baby...

15:18.555 --> 15:20.840
- How much you want for that bush baby?
- Not for sale.

15:20.841 --> 15:23.042
- Come on.
- But buy the skink, I'll throw in the skunk.

15:24.211 --> 15:26.329
I want Griffin to sign
the inside of my eyelids,

15:26.330 --> 15:28.447
so he's the last thing
I see before I go to bed.

15:28.448 --> 15:30.221
What are you going
to ask Boo Boo to sign?

15:30.250 --> 15:32.535
Oh, no, Tina. I don't want
Boo Boo's signature.

15:32.536 --> 15:34.537
I told you, I want to slap him.

15:34.538 --> 15:36.406
I don't know if he'll like that.

15:36.407 --> 15:38.191
That's why it has to be
a surprise attack.

15:38.192 --> 15:40.481
We need to find some place
to burst out of.

15:40.511 --> 15:42.862
In there?
Uh, great idea,

15:42.863 --> 15:45.264
but just in case we
aren't six inches tall,

15:45.265 --> 15:48.251
how about in... there?

15:48.252 --> 15:50.770
- Ah, smells horrible in here.
- Yeah.

15:50.771 --> 15:52.538
It would be terrible
if these smells got stuck

15:52.539 --> 15:54.140
to the inside
of my nostrils and I would

15:54.141 --> 15:56.359
have to smell this sweaty
sweatband forever.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.860
(sniffs)

15:57.861 --> 15:59.250
I think they're coming.

15:59.279 --> 16:00.346
I'll slap Boo Boo in the face,

16:00.381 --> 16:02.081
and we'll be on our way.

16:02.082 --> 16:03.516
Crush crushed.

16:03.550 --> 16:04.951
Whew. Great show, guys.

16:04.952 --> 16:06.419
Yeah. We caused a lot
of smiles tonight.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.870
Totally.

16:07.871 --> 16:09.655
Settle in guys.
We've got an overnighter.

16:11.708 --> 16:12.775
I think we're moving.

16:12.776 --> 16:13.776
Oh, my God.

16:13.777 --> 16:14.944
We're going on tour.

16:14.945 --> 16:17.306
Slapabama, here we come.

16:21.530 --> 16:22.997
Should we jump out now?

16:22.998 --> 16:24.699
What's the protocol
in this situation?

16:24.700 --> 16:26.668
Maybe you shouldn't
rush into this, Louise.

16:26.669 --> 16:28.303
We could just live in here forever.

16:28.304 --> 16:29.771
BUS DRIVER: All right, Boo Boo.

16:29.805 --> 16:31.372
We got to strap you
into your booster seat.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.806
No! I don't wanna!

16:32.807 --> 16:34.675
You know the rules:
When you hit 80 pounds,

16:34.676 --> 16:36.527
you can sit in a big boy seat.
No!

16:36.528 --> 16:38.846
Guys, why don't you sing the song?
(others sigh)

16:38.881 --> 16:40.882
♪ Gettin' into
your booster seat ♪

16:40.883 --> 16:44.118
♪ From your big boy head

16:44.153 --> 16:46.588
♪ Gettin' into your booster seat...

16:46.589 --> 16:47.722
I don't know.

16:47.723 --> 16:49.357
Is "booster seat" code for drugs?

16:49.391 --> 16:51.726
♪ From my big boy head

16:51.727 --> 16:52.739
(Boo Boo chuckles) Boo Boo!

16:52.740 --> 16:53.745
(all scream)

16:53.746 --> 16:55.380
Ah! It's a girl!

16:55.381 --> 16:57.415
A girl saw me in my booster seat!

16:57.416 --> 16:59.334
Don't look at me!

16:59.368 --> 17:00.394
(yelling)

17:00.419 --> 17:02.470
- Stop the bus, Jody.
- TINA: No, Jody,

17:02.504 --> 17:04.255
don't stop the bus.
Who said that?

17:04.256 --> 17:06.057
No one.
You were just thinking it.

17:06.058 --> 17:08.209
- We got another one in the hamper.
- Stopping the bus.

17:08.210 --> 17:10.404
Hi. I'm Tina, your new roadie.

17:10.429 --> 17:11.996
Do I have something on my face?

17:11.997 --> 17:14.157
Just kidding.
I know it's five sweatbands.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.952
We'll let you off
at this rest stop up ahead.

17:17.219 --> 17:18.953
Hey, use the phone.
Call your parents.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.688
They're probably worried about you.

17:20.723 --> 17:22.522
I know I'd be worried
about my daughter.

17:22.523 --> 17:23.625
If I had one.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.093
But I'm 17, so I don't.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.127
Wait.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.462
Before we go, Boo Boo,

17:27.463 --> 17:29.197
my sister wants to
ask you something.

17:29.231 --> 17:31.258
(mumbles)

17:31.283 --> 17:33.885
What?
(mumbles)

17:33.919 --> 17:36.387
What? It sounded like...
(mumbles)

17:36.422 --> 17:39.123
(mumbles) What? What?

17:39.124 --> 17:40.124
What are you saying?

17:40.125 --> 17:41.259
What? What?

17:41.260 --> 17:42.760
Get me out of this thing!

17:42.795 --> 17:44.796
I'm trying to talk to a fan.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.398
Give me just a little dignity.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.067
(sighs) Thank you.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.069
Now, what was that, little girl?

17:54.039 --> 17:55.540
(grunting)

17:57.142 --> 17:58.876
(groans)

18:01.113 --> 18:03.047
- Bold.
- Worth it.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.749
I think we nailed it.
Yeah.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.950
It's daring, it's different.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.485
Nobody else is doing this.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.153
I'll just put a little more

18:09.154 --> 18:11.956
of this strawberry jam
from Mom's purse and...

18:11.957 --> 18:13.091
- done.
- Ugh.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.026
Look at their table.
Nerd alert.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.137
- Am I right?
- BOB: Yeah.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.829
Earth to those guys: You lose.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.747
You guys, we didn't give up
like we usually do,

18:19.748 --> 18:21.149
and I think it really paid off.

18:21.150 --> 18:22.784
I'm proud of us.

18:22.785 --> 18:24.485
All right, here comes the
judge. Good luck, Gene.

18:24.486 --> 18:26.355
Go get 'em, Gene Bean. Yeah!

18:27.956 --> 18:28.990
Eh?

18:29.024 --> 18:30.358
Oh, good Lord.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.395
Welcome to my "Menstru-rant."

18:34.430 --> 18:36.247
I thought we decided
on "Period Piece."

18:36.281 --> 18:39.183
Hope you brought your appetite,
and your hot flashes.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.185
Okay, I think I've seen enough.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.555
As you'll see, beside the plate
is a sanitary napkin.

18:44.590 --> 18:47.208
May I place it on your lap
in case there's a big spill?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.343
No. I...
Please, let me.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.670
Get away.
It's got wings.

18:49.678 --> 18:51.279
- Show her the tampon straw.
- JUDGE: No.

18:51.313 --> 18:53.114
I don't want to see
the tampon straw.

18:53.148 --> 18:54.349
Someone's on the rag.

18:55.818 --> 18:57.785
Well, at least those
two got creamed, too.

18:57.820 --> 18:59.454
(crying): Oh, God...

18:59.455 --> 19:01.689
Dad, do I have to do this again?

19:01.690 --> 19:02.757
Yes.

19:02.791 --> 19:04.292
Them losing is like us winning.

19:04.293 --> 19:05.727
Yeah, and we got fourth place.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.628
I mean, I don't think
any of our kids

19:07.629 --> 19:08.963
have gotten fourth
place in anything.

19:08.964 --> 19:11.532
I'm number four!
I'm number four!

19:11.533 --> 19:14.001
Ooh, I got an idea for next year.

19:14.002 --> 19:15.787
- Baby Jessica stuck in a well.
- Yes!

19:15.788 --> 19:18.122
You have to look for
your dinner for two days

19:18.123 --> 19:20.291
as the nation watches.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.543
TINA: <i>Thanks for coming to get us,
Aunt Gayle.</i>

19:22.578 --> 19:24.011
It was the least I could do.

19:24.012 --> 19:26.214
The good news is my cat
is going to be fine.

19:26.215 --> 19:28.132
He just has to wear
goggles from now on

19:28.133 --> 19:29.300
in case it happens again.

19:29.301 --> 19:30.301
(meows)

19:30.302 --> 19:31.886
Tina, if that's what

19:31.887 --> 19:33.888
your life is like, God,
how are you even alive?

19:33.889 --> 19:35.306
What do you mean?

19:35.357 --> 19:37.392
You have a crush
on almost every boy you know.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.976
How do you do it?

19:38.977 --> 19:41.612
Feeling that way for three hours
was way too much for me.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.364
I'm no hero. I put my bra on

19:43.365 --> 19:45.032
one boob at a time
like everyone else.

19:45.067 --> 19:46.484
Well, the good news is

19:46.485 --> 19:48.569
that now that I got it
out of my system,

19:48.570 --> 19:49.904
I'm done having crushes forever.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.406
I hope for your sake you're right.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.458
But if not, you know where I live.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.909
You're a strong woman, Tina.

19:54.910 --> 19:55.945
I know.

20:00.249 --> 20:02.400
Good night, Tina.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.078
Night, Mom.

20:04.086 --> 20:05.620
Night, Louise.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.155
Did you guys have fun today?

20:07.189 --> 20:08.589
Pretty dull.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.624
Aw.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.843
(makes kissing sounds)

20:13.779 --> 20:15.756
Ugh. Disgusting.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.049
I hate you so freaking much,
