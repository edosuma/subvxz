Okay, how did this detective,

00:08.884 --> 00:10.845
how did this detective
gain proof

00:10.886 --> 00:14.974
that you had been in Luxembourg
City during the problematic...

00:15.015 --> 00:18.144
during that
highly problematic period?

00:18.185 --> 00:19.562
Proof?

00:19.603 --> 00:22.314
Due to a colossal...

00:25.317 --> 00:29.447
...a catastrophic breach
of departmental regulations.

00:32.199 --> 00:37.246
WOMAN: Describe in detail the
circumstances of this breach.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.507
Pop.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.800
What?

00:49.842 --> 00:51.135
Pint?

00:51.177 --> 00:52.511
So?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.180
You?

00:54.221 --> 00:56.599
Never seen you ever
with a pint, Pop, ever.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.809
I love it.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.186

a cold one

01:11.322 --> 01:16.118

this puppet young lady.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.883
Yeah.

-But...
-What?

01:32.593 --> 01:37.056

then, son, you must.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.058
Do you understand?

01:39.099 --> 01:43.103
Yeah, simple as a biscuit.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.170
I am.

02:08.212 --> 02:10.089

02:10.130 --> 02:12.258
Oh. I'm sorry.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.010
I've a rental car.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.346

02:17.388 --> 02:18.889

02:21.016 --> 02:22.476

03:00.055 --> 03:04.685

03:04.727 --> 03:09.064

Yeah.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.077
Yeah.

03:22.119 --> 03:27.291
Well, not for a mom
or someone to say,

03:27.333 --> 03:32.171
but from one guy
to another guy...

03:32.212 --> 03:35.716
kind of, yeah.

03:35.758 --> 03:41.096
It's how we call our children.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.223
Hold on.

03:47.478 --> 03:51.690
You'll break your father

Hit by a car?

04:12.670 --> 04:17.007
You're the next of kin for John?

04:17.049 --> 04:19.760
You're the next of kin?

04:19.802 --> 04:22.012
-For John?
-For John.

04:22.054 --> 04:25.683
-Yeah.
-May I speak with you a moment?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.485
He's with the doctor.

04:36.527 --> 04:39.405
I'm sorry, sir.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.075
He rode his bicycle into my car.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.245
-I'm sorry.
-TOM: Okay.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.540

He rode...

04:51.291 --> 04:55.254
(whispering): knowingly,
through his traffic stop,

04:55.295 --> 04:59.299
in order, I'm afraid,
to hurt himself.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.723

-Hey.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.768
She's having trouble sleeping.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.811
She wants you to sing to her.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.191
Okay.

08:46.193 --> 08:51.114
She said she and her mom
used to listen to your record

08:51.156 --> 08:53.784
at bedtime.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.161

09:00.540 --> 09:02.709
I'm not gonna lie to her.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.381
What do you mean?

09:07.422 --> 09:10.133
You'll overhear if you want to.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.053
I just think you should know
that I'm not gonna lie to her.

09:13.095 --> 09:16.932
What do you mean?

09:16.974 --> 09:20.727
I told her that
I'd never hurt her.

09:20.769 --> 09:25.315
So everything I ever say to her
after that is gonna be true.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.736
So, if you overhear, Alice...

09:29.778 --> 09:33.991
you're gonna hear the truth
about any of it.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.889
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.475
Alice said you couldn't sleep.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.269

10:02.311 --> 10:04.730
Yeah, me, too.

Songs help, sometimes.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.991
Alice and Bernice
will take me to see Chip.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.743
In Disneyland, tomorrow.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.412
-Who's Chip?
-A cup.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.539
-Cool.
-A brave cup.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.249
Cool.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.585
From Beauty and the Beast.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.046
Sounds like a cool day.

10:29.087 --> 10:32.299
-Do you want to know about Chip?
-Sure.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.176
What do you want to know?

10:34.217 --> 10:37.804
Well, why do you like him?

10:37.846 --> 10:39.473
Why do you like a cup?

10:39.514 --> 10:41.892
He wasn't always a cup.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.853
He was a boy before.
Then he became a cup.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.482
-A broken cup.
-Broken how?

10:48.523 --> 10:50.067
MYNA:
He's still a good cup.

10:50.108 --> 10:53.612
He's just broken
'cause he has some chips.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.364
Which is why he's called "Chip."

10:55.405 --> 10:59.368
Oh, okay. Cool.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.996
Where are you going tonight?

11:05.874 --> 11:08.502
I'm gonna climb a bunch
of electric fences.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.504
MYNA:
What is an electric fence?

11:10.545 --> 11:12.339
JOHN:
It's, like, invisible, um...

11:12.381 --> 11:17.135
like, a safety feature
of rods of electricity,

11:17.177 --> 11:20.847
that you can't really touch,
but that I have to touch.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.516
Oh, you know what you should do?

11:22.557 --> 11:24.142
What?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.812
Get a sexy girl to maneuver
around those rays

11:26.853 --> 11:30.482

11:30.524 --> 11:34.903

It's not the same as that.

11:34.945 --> 11:38.323
Electric things
are not that cool.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.617
They just hurt.

11:40.659 --> 11:44.538
But you can go through it.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.540
It just hurts.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.792
I've done it before.

11:48.834 --> 11:52.379
You don't have to go
all the way, anyway.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.006
Why not?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.634
Well, you just have
to go halfway.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.971
-And one more step.
-Why?

12:01.012 --> 12:04.683
If you can make it halfway
and one more step,

12:04.724 --> 12:09.271
it's longer to go back,
and shorter to just finish,

12:09.312 --> 12:10.856
so you just finish.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.275
And you think,
"I don't have to go all the way,

12:13.316 --> 12:16.945
I just have to go halfway,
and one more step."

12:16.987 --> 12:19.823
And then, you can do it.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.909
I'm excited to meet Chip.

12:22.951 --> 12:26.163
Before you meet Chip,
you need some sleep,

12:26.204 --> 12:29.374
so I'm gonna sing you a song.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.960
What song should I sing you?

12:32.002 --> 12:33.879
I know lots.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.215
Sing me a song about going
through electric fences.

12:37.257 --> 12:41.261
I don't really know
any of those.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.347
Make one up.
Can you do that?

12:44.389 --> 12:46.516
Yeah.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.103

"Different" how?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.164
Happy.

I can't.

19:56.946 --> 20:01.743
Because I'm not supposed to know
a detail of what they do.

20:01.784 --> 20:06.414
Not a detail, so we separate.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.918

Is he...

21:20.780 --> 21:23.241
inclined this way?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.159
Or did Tom raise him this way?

21:27.078 --> 21:32.000
Well, you shouldn't
be around here asking.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.171
