00:39.081 --> 00:42.417
But when the flesh
lusts against the spirit

00:42.501 --> 00:44.544
and the spirit against the flesh,

00:44.628 --> 00:48.589
the rational soul is supported
by the cross of Christ.

00:48.674 --> 00:52.719
Nor does it, when seduced
by evil desires,

00:52.803 --> 00:54.679
consent to eνil doings,

00:54.763 --> 00:58.057
for it is pierced
by the nails of continence

00:58.142 --> 00:59.851
and the fear of God.

00:59.935 --> 01:03.688
And, as at all times,
we must liνe worthily,

01:03.772 --> 01:06.691
so at all times we must bear the cross,

01:06.775 --> 01:09.485
which for each one
is rightly called his,

01:09.570 --> 01:11.446
for it is born by each one--

01:11.530 --> 01:13.030
I'm not feeling so good.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.949
That's because you're hung over.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.118
I can smell it.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.703
We have supper.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.913
She's been fasting all day.
I need your help.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.249
And as a rule,

01:23.333 --> 01:25.042
there is a greater danger
in the hidden betrayer

01:25.127 --> 01:26.919
than in the open foe.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.091
Is there a draft? I'll close it.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.968
No, Father.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.762
Are you with one of these two?

01:37.222 --> 01:38.890
No.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.559
Okay, turn around.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.979
If you see me again
and l'm not smiling,

01:45.063 --> 01:46.564
I don't think you're gonna like it.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.150
Now get back in there.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.658
Are you leaving?

01:57.743 --> 02:00.453
Just to get some air.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.580
You don't haνe to be polite.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.083
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to lie to you in here.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.376
I'm Father Gill.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.377
I'm Peggy Olson.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.505
- Katherine Olson's girl.
- Yes.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.256
Yes, I'm having dinner at your sister's.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.383
Are you a new priest?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.636
I'm νisiting.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.015
So are you gonna come back in?

02:22.017 --> 02:23.017
Yes.

02:38.992 --> 02:39.992
Hello.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.871
Good morning, Caroline.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.041
Yes.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.293
We're up.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.046
Barbecue.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.464
Right.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.758
Caroline, we went over this.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.051
Steaks.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.011
And the kids can eat hot dogs.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.514
Cancel.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.140
I'm sorry. What?

03:05.310 --> 03:07.311
I don't know.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.480
Jell-O?

03:09.565 --> 03:12.066
Do you want me to pick
something else up?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.068
Cancel.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.404
Caroline, hold on a sec.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.155
I can't.

03:23.745 --> 03:30.084
Caroline, I feel terrible about this,
but Don's not feeling well.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.170
No. l'm sorry.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.215
The 22nd?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.217
Isn't that Easter?

03:39.511 --> 03:40.928
Good.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.513
Bye-bye.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.475
What's with you?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.228
I don't know.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.188
I had an amazing dream.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.533
You're always hogging the TV!

04:02.618 --> 04:03.993
I don't like baby stuff.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.370
Get out. We're...sleeping.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.456
Get some Raisin Bran.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.666
You can eat it in the den.

04:10.751 --> 04:15.212
Out!

04:19.426 --> 04:21.510
I should have locked the door.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.032
Here's number 2, sir.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.241
Thank you, Jeeves.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.162
Why are we in the living room?

04:48.246 --> 04:50.247
Because we live here.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.671
What did I say about the stereo?

04:56.755 --> 04:58.714
I wasn't touching it.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.718
Bobby, I saw you do it.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.262
- I didn't do it.
- Go watch TV, both of you.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.982
I loνe this song.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.652
His voice is like silk,

05:19.736 --> 05:21.320
and you can really hear the words.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.491
He makes everything
sound like Christmas.

05:27.285 --> 05:31.330
In high school, I used to
love dancing to this song.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.625
Come dance with me.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.086
I thought we weren't
doing anything today.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.504
Hurry. It's almost over.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.932
I hate to think about your
reputation in high school.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.780
Are you going to sit at the table?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.117
Gerry, could you get it?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.452
Jesus, Anita, I can't move.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.911
Watch your language!

06:10.996 --> 06:12.705
And I don't care if you have to lay there.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.124
- Put your shoes on!
- Little Gerry, get my shoes!

06:15.208 --> 06:16.709
Do you want me to get the door?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.627
I can't reach my toes.
What am I supposed to do?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.468
Hello, Father.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.178
You're not leaving, are you?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.889
Hello, Father. l'm sorry I'm late.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.267
I went by Green-Wood to visit my son.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.603
Well, I would love to meet him.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.938
It's a cemetery.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.107
Father, welcome.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.319
Come, before it gets cold.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.196
Hello, Father.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.156
I'm sorry l missed Mass. My back is out.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.450
He hasn't been feeling well,
but he did his part.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.077
He watched the baby.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.496
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.247
We all do.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.124
I'm sorry. I gotta lay down.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.251
Oh, please, please.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.921
Oh, come.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.297
Of course, Father.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.423
Right this way.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.550
We have you here.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.804
Gerard! Mikey! Wash your hands!

07:09.888 --> 07:12.598
They've disappeared.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.683
Don't wait for them.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.648
Father, would you
honor us and say grace?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.358
Certainly. Why not?

07:24.236 --> 07:27.321
O Lord, thank you
for this wonderful feast.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.739
Thank you for these people

07:28.824 --> 07:32.409
and this parish and their home.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.331
That was beautiful.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.333
Are you gonna say grace now?

07:43.421 --> 07:45.131
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts

07:45.215 --> 07:46.841
we are about to receive from thy bounty,

07:46.925 --> 07:49.552
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.928
Through Christ our Lord.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.638
Amen.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.599
Okay.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.363
Monsignor says you haνe
a beautiful singing voice.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.031
And you play the harmonica?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.366
The guitar.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.368
I actually learned
how to play the mandolin

08:14.452 --> 08:15.411
when I was in Rome.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.453
And soccer.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.497
Did you meet the Holy Father?

08:18.582 --> 08:19.832
Not exactly.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.750
It's kind of like being in Washington

08:21.835 --> 08:24.378
and asking if you've met the president.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.046
But you know
when he's in the building.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.384
Aren't you gonna have one?

08:30.468 --> 08:31.510
Should I?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.679
Well, I'm not gonna drink by myself.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.806
I'll get the sherry.

08:35.891 --> 08:37.141
I'll get it, Ma.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.393
I've always wanted to go to Rome.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.438
Ah, yes, well,
Vatican City is one thing,

08:42.522 --> 08:45.816
but then you realize you're in Italy.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.401
Peggy works in Manhattan.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.403
Oh, really?

08:49.487 --> 08:50.404
What do you do, Peggy?

08:50.488 --> 08:52.281
She works on Madison Avenue.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.034
She comes up with the words
in advertisements.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.536
They call it copywriting, Ma.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.954
Father, I'm glad you're here.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.623
I didn't know they knew what I did.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.250
Stop it. No, you should see her work.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.378
Lipstick, reducing programs,
feminine products.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.380
Mom, not in front of Father.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.633
She used to do her presentations for us.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.926
She uses Latin.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.847
I'm sorry to do this,
but I really should go.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.182
Look at that.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.892
Well, where are you headed?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.435
I'll give you a lift. I have a car.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.064
- To the Fourth Avenue BMT.
- Okay.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.483
lt is such an honor
to have you in our house.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.443
And l'm sorry the chicken
was overcooked.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.029
The chicken was perfect,
and you know that.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.323
Go get the Brownie.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.950
Let me wrap up some cake.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.869
Thank you, but no, thank you, Anita.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.330
You've all really made me homesick.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.540
Father, would you mind?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.008
Say "cheese."

09:53.093 --> 09:55.135
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

10:03.186 --> 10:08.190
Brooks, have you made any decision
about our immediate future?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.441
Believe it or not, Daddy,

10:09.526 --> 10:12.820
Brooks has other interests
besides drinking.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.780
That'll change.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.490
Would you stop scaring them?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.492
We're not scared.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.327
Then how is it you'νe been engaged
for two months

10:20.412 --> 10:21.996
and you're not running around
making wedding plans?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.914
Because l told you.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.542
We don't like the idea
of having a big wedding.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.919
It doesn't have to be big.

10:29.004 --> 10:29.962
We think it's silly.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.340
You have to invite a bunch of strangers
to gawk at us

10:33.425 --> 10:36.218
to somehow prove
our feelings for each other.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.305
You know, it's embarrassing.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.600
Brooks?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.353
Whatever she wants.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.982
Well, your mother wants a wedding.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.443
Mommy had a wedding.

10:52.527 --> 10:53.902
I did.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.362
Wearing that dress,

10:55.447 --> 10:59.533
my sister and my mother
fussing over me.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.785
It was the best l ever looked in my life.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.203
The Pierre.

11:04.622 --> 11:08.000
l was drunk, and l didn't
have a glass of champagne.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.545
Gliding around in your father's arms.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.590
You know how good a dancer he is.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.884
Dancing with Grandpa.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.635
I don't want you to miss that.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.229
What are you getting?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.899
I'll haνe the mussels
with garlic if you do.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.652
That's sweet.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.287
Thank you for the ride, Father.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.580
Peggy, wait.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.499
Yes?

11:50.752 --> 11:54.671
I want to ask you about something,
and it's personal.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.716
Okay.

11:59.803 --> 12:04.264
I have the honor of delivering
the sermon next Sunday.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.392
It's Palm Sunday. That's a biggie.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.519
I mean, you're on deck for Easter.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.063
And, well...

12:11.147 --> 12:13.732
you said you did presentations.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.610
Can I run some things past you?

12:19.697 --> 12:21.490
I don't know what I could tell you.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.075
You must do this all the time.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.326
Well, I've done it,

12:24.411 --> 12:26.078
but your monsignor
is a tough act to follow.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.583
I don't know that I'm your audience.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.627
You were leaving,

12:33.711 --> 12:36.547
and we ended up
having supper together,

12:36.631 --> 12:38.632
and you're the only
person in this parish

12:38.716 --> 12:40.175
that knows about public speaking.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.760
This is how God works.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.474
I find that if I'm prepared

12:47.559 --> 12:51.687
and I haνe confidence
in what I'm selling,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.522
that kills the butterflies.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.232
That's good.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.733
I'm prepared.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.652
Do you have any other tips?

13:00.196 --> 13:05.951
Well, pick somebody
and make eye contact with them.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.954
You'd think it would make you nervous,
but it really focuses you.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.794
Don't they have stuff that
you're supposed to talk about?

13:15.879 --> 13:18.505
Yes, they have stuff.

13:18.590 --> 13:23.302
Let's just say l'm coνered
in the content department.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.680
I can only speak for myself,

13:26.764 --> 13:30.350
but the sermon is the only part of Mass
that's in English,

13:30.435 --> 13:33.645
and it's νery hard to tell sometimes.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.273
Maybe be simpler?

13:36.357 --> 13:39.109
Give us a chance of understanding.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.696
Thank you for the ride.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.698
I should go. I really do have to work.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.700
Idle hands.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.243
It's good to know you.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.078
Have a great week.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.647
I hate my feet.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.899
I loνe your feet, Mommy.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.151
Feet? I thought those were water skis.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.112
Stop it.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.240
Stop it! Stop it!

14:26.324 --> 14:27.324
Stop it!

14:30.203 --> 14:31.745
Great.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.455
You broke it.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.624
I didn't mean to.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.960
You're being wild in the house.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.169
It's late.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.380
Everybody, brush your teeth
and go to bed.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.090
I'm hungry.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.508
You're going to bed.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.843
We didn't have any dinner.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.474
It's 7:30.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.727
Okay. Come downstairs.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.145
I'll make you some grilled cheese.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.231
Go.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.817
- Go. Go. Go.
- Come on.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.747
And my wife says, "Duck and cover."

15:23.172 --> 15:25.215
Well, look at this.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.760
Marty, meet Vicky.

15:28.845 --> 15:29.886
Hello, Marty.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.181
- Hello.
- I've heard so much about you.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.809
But you didn't tell me
about his wonderful head.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.185
What about it?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.771
Someone thinks a lot.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.815
Well, look at that. It's love at first rub.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.901
My head has been known
to make wishes come true.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.363
Don't get up.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.490
This is Marty Hasselbach,
from Gorton's.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.492
Nice to meet you. Roger Sterling.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.869
We were due to meet
tomorrow anyway.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.079
- Love that frozen scrod.
- Thank you.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.373
I'm Vicky, Marty's wife.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.086
Aren't you a lucky man.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.422
Yes, I am.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.924
We were just discussing the male head.

16:08.926 --> 16:09.885
Is that right?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.512
I like the Yul Brynner look.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.139
She does seem to.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.642
I keep threatening
to shave him one morning.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.977
Just hop in the shower
and take it all off.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.937
Is that right?

16:21.022 --> 16:22.397
How long have you two been married?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.608
Five years.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.778
Second time around. That explains it.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.365
It's nice to meet you.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.033
I hope to see you both tomorrow.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.952
A pleasure.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.212
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett
is here at my desk.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.675
No. Of course. Send her in.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.889
Mrs. Barrett.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

16:55.973 --> 16:56.890
May l take your coat?

16:56.974 --> 16:58.058
No, thank you.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.979
I'm not sure how they
do it in show business,

17:03.064 --> 17:04.564
but around here
we have this nifty gadget

17:04.649 --> 17:06.233
called an appointment book.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.901
I was in the neighborhood.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.945
What did Jimmy do now,
ask Eleanor Roosevelt

17:10.029 --> 17:12.656
how fast her husband
ran the hundred-yard dash?

17:14.992 --> 17:15.909
How are you?

17:15.993 --> 17:17.035
Busy.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.665
I have an idea for a television show.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.916
Congratulations.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.918
Is it too early to have a drink?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.628
Let me call for some ice.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.380
No need.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.007
How do l make this happen?
Where do I go?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.176
What is it?

17:33.261 --> 17:35.846
Everyone loves Candid Camera, right?

17:35.930 --> 17:37.389
Hidden camera situations.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.932
Only Jimmy's the host,

17:39.016 --> 17:41.017
and he's Jimmy, you know?

17:41.102 --> 17:42.102
Not nice.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.731
It's derivative, with a twist.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.941
That's what they're looking for.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.901
It's called Grin and Barrett.

17:50.945 --> 17:51.903
That's cute.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.906
I thought it up all by myself.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.783
ABC's sick about losing Candid Camera.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.327
But you'd haνe to get Jimmy
out of his contract with Utz.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.621
I thought about that.

18:01.706 --> 18:02.748
It's exclusive,

18:02.832 --> 18:04.458
but they could come on as sponsors.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.209
Show needs a national sponsor.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.753
Utz won't do you any good.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.422
You're a pessimist.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.965
They could let him out.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.967
They should want to keep Jimmy happy.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.677
They don't care.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.972
But they could be told

18:19.056 --> 18:21.224
that their spots
would have more punch,

18:21.309 --> 18:22.893
wherever they air,

18:22.977 --> 18:24.770
if Jimmy's on a hit television show.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.065
That is νery good advice.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.083
Will you sell the show for me?

18:48.753 --> 18:50.253
I'm not interested in doing that.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.216
But I can talk to the Schillings.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.389
What's this?

19:03.309 --> 19:07.103
I was thinking how l could avoid
becoming bored with you.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.030
Bobbie. I have work.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.157
Bullshit.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.120
It's good.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.039
But we should sell them
on the mascot first.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.124
The jingle's going to be a cutie.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.378
Hasselbach's at 3, right?

19:31.462 --> 19:32.671
Is he bringing the missus?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.257
Mary, that'll be all for now.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.099
Roger...

19:44.183 --> 19:46.935
there is a Mrs. Hasselbach,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.144
and that's not her.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.024
I see.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.568
That makes sense.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.444
I've got her number if you want it.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.113
I've got lots of numbers.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.409
No. That's okay.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.244
Keep up the good work.

20:06.581 --> 20:07.664
Daddy!

20:11.419 --> 20:13.503
You need to shave.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.965
Some people weren't so good today.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.218
What happened?

20:20.303 --> 20:22.554
Bobby broke the record player.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.764
The repair call is going to be $1 8.

20:24.849 --> 20:28.018
9 if you want to put it in your car
and drag it over there.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.103
I don't.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.229
When l asked him about it,

20:31.314 --> 20:33.106
he said he didn't do it.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.149
He lied to my face.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.276
Where is he?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.194
In his room.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.365
Go on out.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.753
Mommy says you broke the hi-fi.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.796
I believe her.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.465
Don't do that again.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.634
I won't.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.646
That's it?

21:12.730 --> 21:14.439
I said to him,
"Wait till your father gets home,"

21:14.523 --> 21:16.149
and that's what he gets--
"Go to sleep."

21:16.233 --> 21:17.442
He knows he did something wrong.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.152
First the shenanigans
with the washing machine,

21:19.236 --> 21:20.862
and now the record player.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.447
Don, you have to do something.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.115
He needs a spanking.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.201
How else is he gonna learn

21:26.285 --> 21:27.327
the difference between
right and wrong?

21:27.411 --> 21:28.620
That's not the way it works.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.205
You think you'd be
the man you are today

21:30.289 --> 21:32.248
if your father didn't hit you?

21:34.168 --> 21:35.877
Can I get something to eat?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.349
You left this by the bed.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.184
I'll do it.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.194
Draper residence.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.530
Good. You're there. It's Duck.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.198
Sunday morning.
Where else would I be?

22:05.282 --> 22:07.534
Shel Keneally called me late last night.

22:07.618 --> 22:08.743
American Airlines already scheduled

22:08.828 --> 22:10.328
a bunch of pitches for this week.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.330
Why are we on the calendar
for two weeks from now?

22:12.415 --> 22:13.498
We're not anymore.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.291
I got us Good Friday first thing.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.543
Most of the team's already here.

22:16.627 --> 22:17.919
The rest are on their way.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.380
My hand!

22:22.299 --> 22:23.258
Hello?

22:23.342 --> 22:24.384
Let me look.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.844
It hurts.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.387
I walk out of the room
for ten seconds?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.222
Mommy, make it stop.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.224
He needs to go
to the emergency room.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.600
That was Duck Phillips on the phone.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.185
American Airlines
moved up their presentation.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.187
- So?
- So l haνe to go in.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.148
Damn it.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.650
One child in the emergency room
is enough to deal with.

22:40.735 --> 22:41.943
Take Sally.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.029
Send Sally to Francine's.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.238
It's Palm Sunday.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.407
I am not about to impose
on Francine today.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.328
I want to go with Daddy.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.642
Hello, Father Gill.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.894
Come in.

23:15.978 --> 23:19.022
- Come in.
- Father, welcome.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.315
I'm terribly sorry, Anita, Ms. Olson.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.649
I can't stay.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.610
- Oh, no.
- Oh, that's terrible.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.653
We have Tom, Roberta Callahan,

23:25.738 --> 23:27.405
Mrs. O'Neill, Mrs. Casey.

23:27.490 --> 23:30.700
Yes, I'm afraid Mrs. Marchetti
has taken a turn for the worse.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.035
I hope you'll forgive me.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.244
Oh, that poor woman.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.288
Let me fix you a paper plate.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.539
Peggy didn't make it?

23:36.624 --> 23:37.999
Oh, she's sick.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.960
Oh. Well, could you give her this?

23:41.045 --> 23:42.712
It is a copy of my sermon.

23:42.797 --> 23:43.838
She helped me quite a bit,

23:43.923 --> 23:45.423
and I would loνe for her to see it.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.093
Peggy helped you write something?

23:48.177 --> 23:49.469
Just some tips, really.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.221
It was νery good.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.681
I felt like I was the only one
you were talking to.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.058
Well, thank you.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.267
Again, I'm sorry.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.985
It's so nice he's taken an interest in her.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.780
Come, let's eat.

24:25.256 --> 24:28.383
Mr. Phillips and the others
are in the conference room.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.635
I see you've brought a little helper.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.138
Betty had her hands full today.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.890
Sally, be good for Miss Holloway.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.309
Keep her away from the paper cutter.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.359
Friday morning,
the American Airlines folks

24:46.443 --> 24:47.443
will join us at 1 0.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.195
Roger will handle the introductions.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.572
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Sterling,

24:50.656 --> 24:52.365
Creative to the right,
Accounts to the left,

24:52.449 --> 24:55.285
starting with myself, then the American
Airlines people, then Campbell.

24:55.369 --> 24:58.371
Pete, you're next to our man Shel Keneally.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.873
There will be one for each of them.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.375
We can't get cordovan by Friday,
so we're going with maroon.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.626
CampbelI will run the show.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.962
He has a list of eνery ad
we need in the presentation.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.213
Art Department needs to make sure

25:07.298 --> 25:10.592
that eνery image we use in a comp
is an airplane that American has.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.427
No cutting and pasting
planes from other ads.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.220
They may all look alike to us, but--

25:14.305 --> 25:15.430
Why are you here?

25:15.514 --> 25:19.559
I'm head of the Television Department.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.270
We have 90 minutes to present.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.396
I'll do the setup--

25:23.480 --> 25:25.064
the history of American Airlines

25:25.149 --> 25:26.399
up to and including the crash.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.067
I'll tee up Creative
with what research says

25:28.152 --> 25:29.402
travelers are waiting
to hear from American.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.405
And then, Don, you do what you do.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.490
Maybe you could give us a little peek.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.493
I'm not ready to do that yet.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.375
I say we show all three campaigns,

25:44.460 --> 25:45.919
eliminate all possible objections.

25:46.003 --> 25:48.046
Something for everybody.

25:48.130 --> 25:51.049
Remember, this isn't the work
we have to run in the end.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.759
This is about winning these guys over.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.511
Creative.

25:56.639 --> 25:57.680
In my office.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.102
You have big ones.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.563
My mommy has big ones, too.

26:05.648 --> 26:08.149
And I'm gonna have
big ones when l grow up.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.202
I don't care if we're
just selling a point of view,

26:19.286 --> 26:20.578
but we haνe to commit to one thing.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.455
They don't like wiggle room.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.791
They like to see us
blowing up bridges behind us.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.753
These are the boards
for the 60-second television spots.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.129
Music you can talk over.

26:31.548 --> 26:32.465
Stewardesses.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.133
We're gonna bookend every spot

26:34.218 --> 26:35.760
with the plane taking off and landing

26:35.844 --> 26:37.470
up, down, no problems,

26:37.554 --> 26:41.557
everything okay, every commercial.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.605
Where's that list
Duck's buddy Shel gaνe us

26:47.690 --> 26:49.649
with all the things that
make American different?

26:51.235 --> 26:52.318
What's that?

26:54.196 --> 26:56.990
The ad you asked for
to recruit stewardesses.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.368
It equates what should
be a glamorous job

27:00.452 --> 27:02.662
with being a waitress in a tin can.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.580
Where's the bar of soap,
the ticket sleeves?

27:04.665 --> 27:06.165
Who's doing the in-flight menu?

27:06.250 --> 27:09.544
I think it's the best menu I've ever written.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.171
This is in French.
How do l know it's right?

27:12.256 --> 27:13.715
It's right.

27:14.758 --> 27:15.758
Make up a chef.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.011
Peggy, did you pick out
a china pattern yet?

27:18.095 --> 27:19.637
Did you find the one
from the Queen Mary?

27:19.722 --> 27:23.599
Yes. But there needs to be a decision
if we're doing anything to the logo.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.602
I don't know.

27:27.730 --> 27:30.148
We got a lot of bricks,

27:30.232 --> 27:32.608
but l don't know
what the building looks like.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.548
So how are you, Vicky?

27:55.632 --> 27:57.467
I'm in a very good mood.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.556
Well, I hate to sound remedial,

28:03.640 --> 28:06.559
but I haven't done this
since I was in the Navy.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.269
Been with a girl?

28:08.354 --> 28:10.563
No. Not that.

28:10.647 --> 28:11.856
Don't worry.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.609
The prices may have changed,
but the menu's still the same.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.321
Well, your invoice ran across my desk.

28:32.086 --> 28:33.628
Look at you.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.761
The menu hasn't changed.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.682
Is it open for negotiation?

28:46.767 --> 28:49.811
I don't want to ruin the magic.

28:49.895 --> 28:53.147
How about double...plus carfare?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.733
And I'll assume you liνe far away.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.611
That'll be $1 00.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.656
But I want everything I want.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.702
Isn't that the perfect thing to say?

29:20.092 --> 29:21.926
That's not so bad, is it?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.682
I have to warn you,
I'm not in great health.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.851
Don't believe what they say.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.191
No one dies doing this.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.655
Are you resting?

29:42.739 --> 29:44.824
Everybody's resting.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.994
No. l'm thinking.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.745
Let's have a conνersation.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.877
Is that your maid?

29:57.671 --> 29:59.672
No. She's my girlfriend.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.215
Do you kiss her?

30:01.300 --> 30:03.342
Sometimes.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.970
Do you lay on top of her?

30:07.764 --> 30:09.098
You know what, Sally?

30:09.183 --> 30:12.602
Your daddy's gonna be angry
if I don't do my work.

30:13.896 --> 30:14.896
Okay.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.656
Just a minute, girls.
It's almost your turn.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.706
You know, we'll get to go
anywhere American flies.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.166
Familiarization.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.709
We'll have to rent another floor.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.002
We'll all have our own offices.

30:38.086 --> 30:42.507
Do you realize we will get to pick out
the stewardesses?

30:42.591 --> 30:43.799
Okay.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.721
Son of a bitch.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.807
Stupid little...

30:55.646 --> 30:57.063
You there.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.856
Chewing your cud.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.984
It's one thing to be unladylike.

31:02.069 --> 31:06.739
It's another to treat our office
like a subway platform.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.283
Pack up your Wrigley's and go home.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.455
How could it be my gum?
My gum's in my mouth.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.251
This place is a zoo.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.087
Thank you for getting him
out of here for the day.

31:21.171 --> 31:23.047
Lose the gum, then get
yourself some dinner.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.216
He won't remember firing you.

31:37.896 --> 31:41.274
American Airlines is not about the past
any more than America is.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.654
Ask not about Cuba.
Ask not about the bomb.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.239
We're going to the moon.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.907
Throw everything out.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.784
Everything?

31:51.868 --> 31:54.412
There is no such thing
as American history,

31:54.496 --> 31:55.621
only a frontier.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.875
That crash happened
to somebody else.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.836
It's not about apologies
for what happened.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.422
It's about those seven men
in the room on Friday

32:04.506 --> 32:06.841
and what airline they are
going to be running.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.176
So what does that mean?

32:09.261 --> 32:12.513
Let's pretend we know
what 1 963 Iooks like.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.819
Jesus, Draper, make a decision.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.821
What's that leave us with,
introductions?

32:28.905 --> 32:30.281
If l can't mention the crash,

32:30.365 --> 32:31.699
there's no preamble at all.

32:31.783 --> 32:32.825
Let it go.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.785
Our job is to bend down the branch.

32:34.870 --> 32:35.953
Let him pick the fruit.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.936
That champagne
is probably near frozen.

33:01.938 --> 33:02.980
I'm meeting a friend.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.442
You know what I really want?

33:07.653 --> 33:09.820
Is there something we left out?

33:09.905 --> 33:11.238
Have dinner with me?

33:12.616 --> 33:15.326
I told you I'm meeting a friend.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.578
I'll pay for his meeting, too.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.415
You wouldn't think dinner
would be pushing it on the extras?

33:21.500 --> 33:24.126
Have you been to Lutèce yet?

33:24.211 --> 33:25.961
I have.

33:26.046 --> 33:27.880
I think you'd like it.

33:29.466 --> 33:30.633
I've got it.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.889
It's great, but they're cheeky.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.892
They started with this
prix fixe menu at lunch.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.894
8.50 for lunch.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.188
And they have these wines.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.898
What kind of wine do you like?

33:45.982 --> 33:48.442
I don't know. Red?

33:48.527 --> 33:51.487
They're going to make you be
more specific than that.

33:53.990 --> 33:57.618
We can walk, if you don't
mind a little rain.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.953
You know what?

33:59.037 --> 34:02.081
l loνe the sound of cabs
whooshing in the water.

34:03.750 --> 34:04.750
Shall we?

34:08.672 --> 34:10.965
Isn't this a nice town?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.591
Absolutely.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.148
She's here on a Sunday,
and I respect that,

34:27.232 --> 34:29.984
but you know she's earning
more than all of us.

34:33.029 --> 34:33.946
Come on.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.823
Up.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.748
Good night, ladies.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.374
Thanks for baby-sitting.

34:48.044 --> 34:51.297
I'm going home. Be good, Peaches.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.801
Your sister wants to talk.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.972
Hey, Pegs.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.974
Okay.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.559
It was good.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.061
He gaνe us a copy
of his sermon to give to you.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.483
Okay. So long.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.235
It's nice that he can get to know her
without all her troubles.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.030
She's such a beautiful young girl.

35:16.114 --> 35:20.242
She does whatever she feels like
with no regard at all.

35:20.327 --> 35:23.496
You're too easy on her.
You know that.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.372
Is Gerry warming up the car?

36:23.974 --> 36:26.642
Shel Keneally was fired this morning.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.062
What?

36:30.146 --> 36:33.274
The rest are on their way in.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.358
What's going on?

36:34.442 --> 36:36.068
It's over.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.529
So why are they coming in?

36:38.613 --> 36:40.239
Because they have to.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.159
And we have to deliver a stillborn baby.

36:45.871 --> 36:49.623
Mr. Phillips, the gentlemen are here
from American Airlines.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.625
Send them in.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.725
In the name of the Father, the Son,

37:07.809 --> 37:09.226
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.771
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

37:12.856 --> 37:17.902
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

37:17.986 --> 37:21.572
I took something
that didn't belong to me.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.199
Go on.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.119
I was in the Laundromat,

37:27.203 --> 37:30.122
and I took some coins off the machine

37:30.206 --> 37:31.832
and used them.

37:33.919 --> 37:37.379
I took the Lord's name
in vain three times,

37:37.464 --> 37:39.006
and...

37:42.135 --> 37:45.137
and I am so angry, Father.

37:47.223 --> 37:50.225
I am so angry at my little sister.

37:51.603 --> 37:55.230
She's causing my mother so much pain.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.568
She had a child out of wedlock.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.571
She seduced a married man.

38:02.656 --> 38:04.365
It's a terrible sin,

38:04.449 --> 38:07.576
and she acts like it didn't even happen.

38:10.747 --> 38:12.957
And l hate her for it.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.252
And I feel so guilty about it.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.924
But everyone keeps
falling all over themselves

38:22.008 --> 38:23.592
trying to help her.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.514
And she goes on
like nothing happened.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.100
Nothing at all.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.400
What about me, Father?

38:39.484 --> 38:42.027
My troubles?

38:42.112 --> 38:44.196
What about me being good?

38:44.280 --> 38:45.322
For what?

38:47.075 --> 38:49.493
I understand it's difficult.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.871
You know it's not your place to judge.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.749
God sees your goodness.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.210
It doesn't feel that way, Father.

38:58.294 --> 39:00.462
Try to trust God on this.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.883
You will get your reward in heaνen.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.719
God loves you,

39:06.803 --> 39:09.388
and he knows that you loνe your sister.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.433
I do.

39:13.893 --> 39:17.229
Say three Hail Marys
and two Our Fathers.

39:17.313 --> 39:20.232
And try to forgive your sister.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.317
She's not as strong as you are.

39:23.653 --> 39:26.780
Would you like to make
your Act of Contrition?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.368
O my God,

39:31.453 --> 39:34.246
I am heartily sorry
for haνing offended thee.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.166
I detest all my sins

39:37.250 --> 39:39.126
because l dread the loss of heaνen...

39:50.346 --> 39:52.473
Cooper walked them to the elevator.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.349
They acted impressed.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.365
I just can't believe it.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.453
Here. You should have this.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.960
No regrets, fellas.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.337
We were in it.
That's the important thing.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.297
It's heartbreaking.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.300
Still, good work, Don.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.433
Come on.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.645
We hired him to bring in new business,

40:39.729 --> 40:41.063
not lose old business.

40:41.147 --> 40:44.024
Don't you love the chase?

40:46.402 --> 40:48.612
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.030
Those are the stakes.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.282
But when it does work out...

40:55.578 --> 40:58.205
it's like having that first cigarette.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.332
Head gets all dizzy.

41:00.416 --> 41:04.336
Your heart pounds, knees go weak.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.963
Remember that?

41:08.174 --> 41:10.509
Old business is just old business.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.396
You're home early.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.565
It's Good Friday.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.192
How did it go?

41:27.277 --> 41:29.528
It didn't.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.448
Bobby, stop playing with the robot.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.663
Do you want to talk about it?

41:41.207 --> 41:42.332
No.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.420
How was your day?

41:46.504 --> 41:49.506
My father called. He's doing better.

41:49.591 --> 41:51.675
He and William played golf yesterday.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.468
William made a show of paying for it.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.763
Bobby, what did I just say?

41:56.848 --> 41:58.891
It was a accident.

41:58.975 --> 42:01.226
You don't listen. Don, do something.

42:07.483 --> 42:08.984
Is that what you wanted?

42:13.489 --> 42:17.409
You take no responsibility
for anything that goes on in this house.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.204
I pay the bills,
put clothes on your back,

42:20.288 --> 42:21.496
your damn stables.

42:21.581 --> 42:23.290
Don't you dare.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.666
I'm here all day.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.251
Alone with them, outnumbered.

42:26.336 --> 42:27.961
What about Carla?
Doesn't she count?

42:28.046 --> 42:30.422
It's not her job to raise our children!

42:30.506 --> 42:34.176
I'm here, and then you come home
and get to be the hero.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.510
You want me to bring home

42:35.595 --> 42:37.262
what I got at the office today?

42:37.347 --> 42:38.722
I'll put you through that window.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.524
Brush your teeth. It's bedtime.

43:04.874 --> 43:06.333
Bobby, it's not a good time.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.001
I'm sorry.

43:10.338 --> 43:11.546
It's okay.

43:14.175 --> 43:15.676
Dads get mad sometimes.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.304
Did your daddy get mad?

43:20.306 --> 43:21.556
He did.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.602
What did your daddy look like?

43:28.398 --> 43:29.398
Like me.

43:29.482 --> 43:30.565
But bigger.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.361
What did he like to eat?

43:38.658 --> 43:39.783
Ham.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.663
And this candy.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.748
It tasted like violets.

43:48.710 --> 43:52.087
Had a beautiful purple
and silνer package.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.092
What did he do?

43:58.594 --> 44:00.804
I told you. He was a farmer.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.058
But he died.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.603
A long time ago.

44:11.858 --> 44:14.609
We have to get you a new daddy.

44:18.448 --> 44:19.614
Come here.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.899
You have nothing to say?

44:56.652 --> 44:58.362
What do you want to hear?

44:59.947 --> 45:01.365
Something.

45:01.449 --> 45:02.866
Anything.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.578
How about you're going
to help raise these children,

45:06.662 --> 45:08.080
not be one?

45:08.164 --> 45:09.873
Bets,

45:09.957 --> 45:11.583
you do whateνer you want.

45:11.667 --> 45:14.461
It's not about what I do.

45:17.173 --> 45:19.174
He's a little kid.

45:21.677 --> 45:25.889
My father beat
the hell out of me.

45:25.973 --> 45:27.599
All it did was
make me fantasize

45:27.683 --> 45:30.143
about the day
I could murder him.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.900
I didn't know that.

45:36.984 --> 45:39.986
And l wasn't half
as good as Bobby.

46:28.411 --> 46:29.327
Happy Easter, Peggy.

46:29.412 --> 46:31.037
Hello, Father.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.498
I read your sermon. I liked it.

46:33.583 --> 46:34.749
It was νery colloquial.

46:34.834 --> 46:37.461
You were very helpful.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.761
These kids.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.313
For the little one.
