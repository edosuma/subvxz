00:33.104 --> 00:36.073
He's to always wear
a sign that says "number 1."

00:36.141 --> 00:38.342
It signifies that he is
the one med student

00:38.410 --> 00:41.111
For which I have hope.
Thanks. It's a nightmare.

00:41.179 --> 00:44.048
All the best, number 1.

00:44.115 --> 00:46.450
You don't have to wear this.

00:46.518 --> 00:48.953
Look how--look how silly
it looks on me, yeah?

00:49.020 --> 00:50.955
I hate wearing this so much.

00:51.022 --> 00:53.958
(groans)
he said, "you put that on you,"
and he was yelling.

00:54.025 --> 00:55.960
And I was like,
"okay, don't get mad."

00:56.027 --> 00:58.963
But I don't want to wear it.
I don't.

00:59.030 --> 01:02.299
Guard that, number 1.

01:02.367 --> 01:03.434
No.

01:03.501 --> 01:05.936
You're dangerous, aren't you?
Yes, I am.

01:06.004 --> 01:08.572
I bet you listen
to rap music.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.876
<i>(lucy) there he is.</i>

01:12.944 --> 01:14.845
<i>No one has sex
with lucy bennett,</i>

01:14.913 --> 01:17.414
<i>Takes naked pictures of her
and gets away with it.</i>

01:17.482 --> 01:19.149
Cole.

01:19.217 --> 01:22.653
<i>I'm not sure
I like what you did.
Served!</i>

01:22.721 --> 01:26.156
I know I blew any chance of us
being together again,

01:26.224 --> 01:28.559
And that kills me.
And I'm sorry.

01:28.627 --> 01:32.029
I just... Need to think about
who I am for a second, you know?

01:32.097 --> 01:34.832
'sup, boo? What you doing?

01:34.899 --> 01:37.668
I'm making sure these machines
keep this vegetable alive.

01:37.736 --> 01:40.671
Man, I wish his family
would just let him die.

01:40.739 --> 01:42.673
Mm, cool, cool.

01:42.741 --> 01:46.810
So what are we gonna do
about... This?

01:46.878 --> 01:48.812
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:48.880 --> 01:53.851
I'm talking about this--this
electricity, this spark. Zzt!

01:53.918 --> 01:55.786
Go now.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.221
(sighs) okay.

01:57.289 --> 02:00.124
Here's a little secret
about old king cole.

02:00.191 --> 02:04.194
The only way to get rid of him
is to sleep with him...

02:04.262 --> 02:07.364
(whispers)
until he gets bored with you.

02:07.432 --> 02:09.967
Yeah, I'm gonna go get
a wire brush

02:10.035 --> 02:13.137
And scrub my skin
till I bleed.

02:13.204 --> 02:15.306
All right, class, first order
of business is simple.

02:15.373 --> 02:19.076
We're gonna take out our...
J.D., what are you doing?

02:19.144 --> 02:21.445
Just watching you teach.
You know, in this light,

02:21.513 --> 02:25.115
You look like denzel washington
in "the great debaters."

02:25.183 --> 02:27.518
Come on, man. I'm working here.
Now listen. If you--

02:27.585 --> 02:30.521
You know that's what I was
going for, right?
It's pretty obvious.

02:30.588 --> 02:32.523
All right, class,
you now have 30 seconds

02:32.590 --> 02:35.426
To list the adductor muscles
of the hip.

02:35.493 --> 02:38.696
Your group does not want
to be last. Ready? Go.

02:38.763 --> 02:41.932
<i>(j.D.) the pressure here can
make some students crack...
(man) aah!</i>

02:42.000 --> 02:45.803
Aah!
Amir, you can't just
be grabbing kidneys like that!

02:45.870 --> 02:47.338
Bring it back!

02:47.405 --> 02:50.341
<i>Others found ways
to blow off steam.</i>

02:51.910 --> 02:53.944
What? What are you doing?
No. Stop. Take it off.

02:54.012 --> 02:55.913
I can't. H-he'll know.
He's everywhere.

02:55.980 --> 02:59.083
And the worst part--
drew, I don't care.
I'm losing wood.

02:59.150 --> 03:02.553
<i>And dr. Cox made sure
that the pressure never let up.</i>

03:02.620 --> 03:05.122
Centerfold, your previous answer
was so wrong,

03:05.190 --> 03:07.124
It almost became right again.

03:07.192 --> 03:09.693
Now if you would, please help me
choose the subject

03:09.761 --> 03:12.396
For my impending criticism.
Would you like me to nail you

03:12.464 --> 03:14.398
For "a," you being
too attractive

03:14.466 --> 03:16.433
To ever be taken seriously
as a doctor,

03:16.501 --> 03:18.402
"b," your upsettingly small ears

03:18.470 --> 03:22.106
Or "c," that your stupidity is
probably contagious?
I guess
my contagious stupidity.

03:22.173 --> 03:24.641
Great call. Your ears.
Ah ha ha!

03:24.709 --> 03:26.577
Welcome, welcome, number one.

03:26.644 --> 03:29.046
Certainly,
with your human-size ears,

03:29.114 --> 03:31.081
You can tell us
what the three components

03:31.149 --> 03:33.417
Of the mucosa layer
of the stomach are.

03:33.485 --> 03:36.587
Epithelium, lamina propria,
muscularis mucosa.

03:36.654 --> 03:38.622
That was perfect.

03:38.690 --> 03:42.126
Okay, class, who hates
dr. Cox's favorite student?
(man) I do.

03:42.193 --> 03:44.194
Wo it's the first time
you assassins

03:44.262 --> 03:47.398
Have gotten one right all day.

03:47.465 --> 03:50.401
<i>There was one bright light
for these kids, though,</i>

03:50.468 --> 03:52.503
<i>And that was me, dr. D.</i>

03:52.570 --> 03:55.038
Hey, bro, the sun is,
like, super bright.

03:55.106 --> 03:56.407
Can you come down?

03:56.474 --> 03:59.476
I, like, told you that
the branches are a metaphor

03:59.544 --> 04:01.011
For the cardiovascular system,

04:01.079 --> 04:03.147
So no, I cannot come down.

04:03.214 --> 04:05.349
Hence, tree class dismissed.

04:05.417 --> 04:08.185
Great class, dr. D.

04:08.253 --> 04:10.921
Even better than the one you did
with interpretive dance.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.890
Thanks. I call it
"teacher-tainment."

04:12.957 --> 04:15.859
Would you be a doll and get
a message to dr. Turk a.S.A.P.?

04:15.927 --> 04:17.861
Tell him I'm stuck
in the tree again,

04:17.928 --> 04:20.764
But this time there appear
to be many bees.
(bees buzzing)

04:20.832 --> 04:23.467
Hurry, lucy!
I've got honey hair!

04:23.535 --> 04:26.270
Ugh. That tool
cole keeps texting me.

04:26.337 --> 04:29.773
"I have a little cole
for your slaw."
so romantic.
You should hit that.

04:29.841 --> 04:32.776
At least dr. Cox doesn't make
you send a picture of yourself

04:32.844 --> 04:36.413
Every ten minutes
wearing a "number 1" sign.
Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

04:36.481 --> 04:39.216
Talking.
No, this feels like sharing,
and it's gross.

04:39.284 --> 04:42.052
Drew, I need to be clear about
what it is I'm looking for,

04:42.120 --> 04:44.288
You know, with us.
Nothing.
Same here.

04:44.355 --> 04:47.825
Sorry about the sharing.
Oh, no, no.
It was both of us.

04:49.627 --> 04:53.030
Oh, now that's just outstanding.

04:53.097 --> 04:56.366
Dude, again?
Finally. Where have you been?

04:56.434 --> 04:58.969
I came as soon as I heard.

04:59.037 --> 05:02.306
I thought you said there were
bees. Where are the bees?
They're quiet now, but I think
they're plotting something big.

05:04.175 --> 05:06.844
(gun cocks)
let's get him out of there.

05:06.911 --> 05:09.780
Hell, yeah. Give me a chance
to use old megan fox. Mwah.

05:09.848 --> 05:11.815
That's just a tranq gun.
It's an elephant dose.

05:11.883 --> 05:14.918
But don't worry. We cut it
with some diet soda.
Can't we just shake
the tree again?

05:14.986 --> 05:16.553
Go shake.

05:16.621 --> 05:19.356
Come on, little white baby.
Jump into my arms.

05:20.592 --> 05:22.659
(grunts) you all right?

05:22.727 --> 05:26.163
It's like being held
by a big piece of caramel.

05:28.707 --> 05:31.709
<i>(lucy) you never want to end up
in dr. Cox's eye line,</i>

05:31.710 --> 05:34.579
<i>Because if he sees you,
he makes you do grunt work.
(man) you all right?</i>

05:34.580 --> 05:37.315
Oh, what the french?
Sorry.

05:37.316 --> 05:39.150
I was just hiding
from one of my teachers.

05:39.151 --> 05:41.319
It's a little game we play.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.022
Really?
No. You can win at games.

05:44.023 --> 05:46.691
Got bad news for you,
sweetheart. You lost.

05:51.330 --> 05:54.399
I need you to go ahead
and take mr. Evans' chart here

05:54.400 --> 05:56.901
And make four copies.
Drop one off at my office,

05:56.902 --> 05:59.337
One at my car,
one at the bar that I frequent

05:59.338 --> 06:02.306
And then go bury one in the quad
and draw me up a map,

06:02.307 --> 06:05.176
Just in case I want to go on
a treasure hunt later on.

06:05.177 --> 06:07.645
Hmm. 10 after.
Goodness gracious.
(cell phone alert chimes)

06:07.646 --> 06:10.348
Oh, darn it all.
Now if that ink runs,

06:10.349 --> 06:12.650
I'm gonna have to replace
the whole sign.

06:12.651 --> 06:14.685
Weird. Broken ribs
and a possible ruptureleen?

06:14.686 --> 06:18.689
Was mr. Evans in an accident?
Yes, he was in a train wreck
called his life.

06:18.690 --> 06:20.625
You see, alan evans is
a hard-core drunk,

06:20.626 --> 06:22.827
An alkie, a sauce monkey,
a hooch goblin,

06:22.828 --> 06:25.830
A man who unwinds
at the end of every single day

06:25.831 --> 06:27.632
By treating himself

06:27.633 --> 06:30.368
To a delightful garbage bag
full of vodka.
So what are we gonna do?

06:30.369 --> 06:32.336
We're going to get him
out of here,

06:32.337 --> 06:35.339
And then hopefully,
he's gonna die someplace else,

06:35.340 --> 06:37.341
Like in a yard
or somebody's shed.

06:42.548 --> 06:46.050
I love teaching.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.922
Mr. Shershow here is
in a massive coma.

06:50.923 --> 06:54.158
Even though he can't register
any outside stimulus,

06:54.159 --> 06:57.095
I still want someone to read him
all seven "h potter" books.

06:57.096 --> 06:59.564
Any volunteers?
Cole, thank you.

06:59.565 --> 07:03.167
Sorry. No can do. I got
a dinner rezzie with my moms.

07:03.168 --> 07:06.003
A rezzie? You also gonna get
your drun and eat some 'za?

07:06.004 --> 07:08.506
Nah, I wish.
My mom is lactose-intolly.

07:08.507 --> 07:10.675
For real, though,
she is the best.

07:10.676 --> 07:12.877
When we go out,
she helps me pick up girls.

07:12.878 --> 07:14.912
She's my wingmom.

07:14.913 --> 07:16.747
Horrifying.
Look, I don't know

07:16.748 --> 07:19.350
What orlando-based boy band
rejected you,

07:19.351 --> 07:21.919
But you'll do what I tell you.
Yeah, I don't think so.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.255
See,
that's me and my 'rents...

07:24.256 --> 07:26.958
(singsongy) at the hospital
groundbreaking.

07:26.959 --> 07:28.593
Wow.
They're
in the major donors club.

07:28.594 --> 07:31.662
I got to cut the ribbon
with some big old sizzies.

07:31.663 --> 07:33.631
Long story short...

07:33.632 --> 07:35.566
(chuckles)
I'm untouchable around here...

07:35.567 --> 07:37.401
To everyone except you.

07:40.305 --> 07:41.739
Yeah. That just happened.

07:41.740 --> 07:42.974
(whispers) okay.

07:42.975 --> 07:45.843
I know people like alan.
I grew up with them.

07:45.844 --> 07:48.112
My uncle frank is
always drunk.

07:48.113 --> 07:51.582
He fought the entire band
at my cousin's wedding.
Okay, look.

07:51.583 --> 07:54.085
Alan's an addict, so the first
thing you need to do

07:54.086 --> 07:57.355
Is make sure he's ready
for help.
I can't talk to him
about stuff that pernal.

07:57.356 --> 08:00.892
I get embarrassed too easily.
I've never seen myself nude.

08:00.893 --> 08:02.660
I mean, I've been nude,

08:02.661 --> 08:04.529
But I never looked down.

08:04.530 --> 08:06.664
Weird for a doctor,
but okay, fine.

08:06.665 --> 08:09.400
Look, lucy, you have to find
a way to connect with him.

08:09.401 --> 08:13.771
I like your perfume.
That's weird, because I've never
worn perfume in my entire life.

08:13.772 --> 08:16.307
Also, I've never seen myself
ked.

08:16.308 --> 08:19.577
You know, that was part
of an earlier conversation.

08:19.578 --> 08:21.746
Are you okay?

08:21.747 --> 08:24.315
I'm not great, alan.
Med school is tough.

08:24.316 --> 08:27.185
I don't sleep, and I haven't
eaten anything a week

08:27.186 --> 08:29.120
Except yogurt and wine.

08:29.121 --> 08:36.928
Maybe you should take a--
alan, I'm not done.

08:36.929 --> 08:39.530
And just beat him a little,
you know, send a message? What?

08:39.530 --> 08:42.033
Denise, you're scary. I mean,
sure, you seem cute at first,

08:42.034 --> 08:44.402
But then you eat after midnight
or get some water on you,

08:44.403 --> 08:46.837
And then boom,
you turn into this monster,

08:46.838 --> 08:50.908
And I gotta throw you
in a microwave and explode you.
What the hell are
you talking about?

08:50.909 --> 08:53.544
You know, you should get your
boyfriend to watch that movie,

08:53.545 --> 08:56.414
And then maybe he could
understand you better.
What boyfriend?

08:56.415 --> 08:58.382
Denise, everybody knows
drew's hitting you.
How?

08:58.383 --> 09:00.585
The guy's had sex
near the todd.

09:00.586 --> 09:03.688
What? What's going on?

09:03.689 --> 09:07.291
Someone's doing it right now,
in that supply closet.

09:07.292 --> 09:11.829
(whispers) really?

09:11.830 --> 09:13.998
Still...

09:13.999 --> 09:16.133
Damn it.

09:16.134 --> 09:19.103
How come you don't let him
take his pants off, though?

09:20.539 --> 09:23.307
Man, that was a great cry.

09:23.308 --> 09:25.876
I always feel fantastic
after those.

09:25.877 --> 09:28.813
Hello, world. Lucy's back.
Am I right?

09:28.814 --> 09:33.251
Well, you definitely gave me
something to work with.

09:33.252 --> 09:35.820
And I look chinese,
but that's really good.

09:35.821 --> 09:38.823
Thank you. I used
to teach high school art.

09:38.824 --> 09:40.992
<i>(lucy) oh, my god.
He's opening up.
Oh, yeah.</i>

09:40.993 --> 09:44.629
Yeah, I was married, too,
before everything fell apart.

09:44.630 --> 09:47.498
I tell you what, though--
I definitely don't want

09:47.499 --> 09:49.567
To live this way anymore.

09:49.568 --> 09:51.569
Maybe you don't have to.

09:53.138 --> 09:55.606
I thought you had dinner plans
with your wingmom.

09:55.607 --> 09:58.209
Yeah, she's at the bar, sizing
up the local talent for me.

09:58.210 --> 10:00.911
No! Yeah, I like
more booty than that.

10:00.912 --> 10:03.014
She should know that by now.

10:03.015 --> 10:05.316
I know you feel me.
Yeah, I do.

10:05.317 --> 10:07.652
Is a wingmom what I think it is?

10:13.191 --> 10:16.594
Sing to me, wingmom.
Sing me to my dreams.

10:16.595 --> 10:18.629
Hello, all.

10:18.630 --> 10:20.998
Hey.
(imitates drew) hello, all.
(scoffs)

10:20.999 --> 10:23.367
(normal voice) I hate that guy.
But you love that guy.

10:23.368 --> 10:25.169
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

10:25.170 --> 10:27.171
What?
I'm not surprised.
You're both dark weirdos.

10:27.172 --> 10:30.207
It's like if fonzie
and jo from "the facts of life"

10:30.208 --> 10:33.177
Fell in love with each other.
Oh, I'd watch the hell
out of that show.

10:33.178 --> 10:35.212
Who wouldn't?
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

10:35.213 --> 10:37.081
I like to be an island,
okay?

10:37.082 --> 10:39.884
People can visit the island,
but no one gets to stay.

10:39.885 --> 10:41.419
Safer that way.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.688
Do you realize how empty
that sounds?

10:43.689 --> 10:47.391
What kind of life is that?
You know, I'd watch a show about
fonzie and a gremlin, too.

10:47.392 --> 10:49.327
Mm, fonzie couldn't take care
of a gremlin.

10:49.328 --> 10:51.495
He's too busy being cool.
Oh.

10:51.496 --> 10:53.864
Can we stop talking
about this?
You know what you need?

10:53.865 --> 10:56.033
# a water taxi
to your island #

10:56.034 --> 10:59.503
# so he can get there,
and you can kiss him #

10:59.504 --> 11:02.306
# up on your island,
all chillin' with turtles #

11:02.307 --> 11:06.077
# 'cause you're so private,
and now falsetto #

11:06.078 --> 11:08.713
oh, yes, falsetto
* uh-oh, she's leavin' #

11:14.920 --> 11:18.189
Look, alan wants to change,
so I found him a rehab facility.

11:18.190 --> 11:22.393
I just need a doctor
to sign off. Are you in?

11:22.394 --> 11:25.429
<i>And that was the beginning
of a long line of "nos."</i>

11:25.430 --> 11:28.065
<i>I asked all the doctors
in the hospital,</i>

11:28.066 --> 11:30.334
<i>And they all shot me down.</i>

11:34.336 --> 11:36.637
Naive-five!

11:38.307 --> 11:40.408
Someone please wake me
from this nightmare,

11:40.409 --> 11:42.477
Because in my fever dream,

11:42.478 --> 11:45.446
I see a med student getting
involved with a patient

11:45.447 --> 11:48.416
Who I expressly told her
to ignore mere hours ago.

11:48.417 --> 11:51.986
I cannot tell you how much
I hate to reiterate something,

11:51.987 --> 11:54.555
Especially when I have
already iterated it.

11:54.556 --> 11:56.657
You're going to have
to excuse me now

11:56.658 --> 11:59.127
Because I must
gather my fury.

11:59.128 --> 12:02.597
<i>It's scary to put yourself
out there.</i>

12:02.598 --> 12:05.099
Hey.
Hey.

12:05.100 --> 12:09.103
Oh, I am having a crapfest
of a day today.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.540
You want to hang out later?
You know, maybe grab a beer?

12:12.541 --> 12:15.343
Grab a beer?
Yeah.

12:15.344 --> 12:17.678
Is that
some kind of euphemism?

12:17.679 --> 12:20.047
Nope. It just means
grab a beer.

12:20.048 --> 12:21.549
Maybe talk a little.

12:25.087 --> 12:26.454
I'm sorry, denise.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.456
I'm, uh...

12:28.457 --> 12:30.758
Just not looking for that.

12:30.759 --> 12:32.193
See you later.

12:34.930 --> 12:37.899
Dr. Cox, while you're
fury-gathering, let me just say

12:37.900 --> 12:39.634
That if alan goes to rehab--

12:39.635 --> 12:42.036
He will do nothing
except figure out

12:42.037 --> 12:44.605
How to steal enough
paper cup shooters of mouthwash

12:44.606 --> 12:46.574
To get
one last desperate buzz on.

12:46.575 --> 12:48.609
His job is to leave here
and die.

12:48.610 --> 12:52.747
<i>Your job is to listen to
every word I say at all times--</i>

12:52.748 --> 12:55.883
And here's the hard part--
actually do those things.

12:55.884 --> 12:58.786
So in the future,
when I tell you to do nothing,

12:58.787 --> 13:04.325
I mean nothing, and in case
that is still not clear...
Nothing

13:25.085 --> 13:27.052
I thought being a doctor
was about helping people.

13:27.053 --> 13:29.254
It is, lucy.
Well, that and showing up

13:29.255 --> 13:32.224
My third grade teacher who said
I'd never amount to anything.

13:32.225 --> 13:35.027
<i>Eat it, mrs. Nickerson.
(j.D.) and rest in peace.</i>

13:35.028 --> 13:37.296
All right, I didn't want
to play hardball,

13:37.297 --> 13:40.366
But if you don't try to change
dr. Cox's mind about alan,

13:40.367 --> 13:43.702
I will never call you "dr. D."
ever again.
Even in the quad?

13:43.703 --> 13:46.572
Especially in the quad.
I'll go talk to dr. Cox
right now.

13:48.775 --> 13:50.776
Dr. Cox said
he'll sign the paper

13:50.777 --> 13:53.812
If you can raise the money
to send alan to a rehab center.

13:53.813 --> 13:57.516
Dr. D., you rock.
And sometimes I roll.

13:57.517 --> 14:00.886
Aah! Ow!
You twclowns convinced me

14:00.887 --> 14:03.622
To put myself out there,
and drew shot me down.

14:03.623 --> 14:05.791
Why'd you have to go mess up
my little island?

14:05.792 --> 14:08.694
Why'd you push me
towards drew?
He just seems like a nice guy.

14:08.695 --> 14:10.596
Based on what?

14:10.597 --> 14:13.766
Want the rest of my nachos?
Oh, hell, yeah!

14:13.767 --> 14:16.201
You like him 'cause
he shared old bar food?

14:16.202 --> 14:23.575
Turk and I met
over a bloomin' onion.

14:23.576 --> 14:28.681
I will hurt you, little man.

14:32.752 --> 14:35.888
You all right, little lady?
I'm just trying to raise money
for a patient,

14:35.889 --> 14:38.724
But it's not going so great.
You know, back in the day

14:38.725 --> 14:40.926
When I did security
for bell biv devoe--

14:40.927 --> 14:42.928
Hey, boss--
shut up.

14:42.929 --> 14:45.898
Copy that.
Anyway, they did their charity
car wash a little differently.

14:54.174 --> 14:56.008
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're all real smart.

14:56.009 --> 14:59.211
Now it's time to get wet.

14:59.212 --> 15:01.780
Wow.
Where do I get in line?

15:01.781 --> 15:03.782
Where's your car?

15:03.783 --> 15:05.684
What car?
Full body wax-five.

15:05.685 --> 15:08.187
Buff away, ladies.

15:10.623 --> 15:13.692
You know, I don't mean to sound
too forward, but there is

15:13.693 --> 15:16.195
Someone at the hospital
who is really digging you.

15:16.196 --> 15:18.430
Are you hitting on me?
'cause I already went through

15:18.431 --> 15:21.633
My bald black dude phase.
Seriously, I did.
I'm talking about
you and denise.

15:21.634 --> 15:25.704
Why are you talking about
me and denise?
Because the other night
when we shared the nachos?

15:25.705 --> 15:28.140
Dude, we're na-bros.
Come on.

15:28.141 --> 15:30.943
And that's a special bond--
one which I... Cherish.

15:30.944 --> 15:33.178
I just think
you should go for yours.

15:33.179 --> 15:35.948
(falsetto voice)
¶ go for yours ¶
you don't know me.
I spent the last year

15:35.949 --> 15:37.850
In the askan wilderness,
living in a yurt.

15:37.851 --> 15:40.986
The only human contact I had
was an eskboy who sold me

15:40.987 --> 15:43.655
Salmon jerky and painkillers.
And do you know why?

15:43.656 --> 15:45.591
Because when I flunked
out of med school before,

15:45.592 --> 15:48.260
I consequently torched
every relationship

15:48.261 --> 15:51.497
That meant anything to me. I'm
not taking that chance again.
What's a yurt?

15:51.498 --> 15:56.401
You know, son, I was married
to my enid for 44 years.

15:56.402 --> 15:58.303
And now she's gone.

15:58.304 --> 16:00.038
And the only reason I teach is

16:00.039 --> 16:02.141
So I don't have to be alone
in my house.

16:02.142 --> 16:05.244
You can't wall yourself off
from other people.

16:05.245 --> 16:08.147
You won't make it.
That's some truth
being dropped there.

16:08.148 --> 16:10.048
Great.

16:10.049 --> 16:12.151
So how about you two clear out?

16:12.152 --> 16:14.419
Cindy here's three martinis in,

16:14.420 --> 16:17.790
And I'm about to land
that marlin.

16:19.058 --> 16:20.726
Oh, damn.

16:20.727 --> 16:23.862
She was go to go.

16:23.863 --> 16:25.898
Remember, alan,
you can do it.

16:25.899 --> 16:28.534
I can't thank you enough.

16:35.141 --> 16:38.210
<i>(lucy) I knew I'd just changed
alan's life,</i>

16:38.211 --> 16:40.546
<i>But I wasn't gonna make
a big deal out of it.</i>

16:40.547 --> 16:43.282
<i>(man) lifetime presents
antonio sabato jr.</i>

16:43.283 --> 16:44.783
<i>As alan the drunk.</i>

16:44.784 --> 16:47.953
<i>A man this broken...
I'm just really broken.</i>

16:47.954 --> 16:50.055
<i>Needs a woman this strong...</i>

16:50.056 --> 16:53.659
You can do this, alan.
(bottle shatters)

16:53.660 --> 16:57.196
<i>With a mentor
who cares so much.</i>

16:57.197 --> 17:00.365
God, I care so much.

17:00.366 --> 17:03.335
I guess this is good-bye.

17:03.336 --> 17:05.637
No, we can't.

17:05.637 --> 17:09.473
I know you're a doctor.
I'm a med student, damn it.

17:09.474 --> 17:12.444
Lucy.
Shh.

17:28.862 --> 17:30.963
<i>(lucy) antonio sabato jr.--</i>

17:30.964 --> 17:33.732
<i>My safely ethnic dreamboat.</i>

17:33.733 --> 17:35.601
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

17:35.602 --> 17:37.836
<i>I stayed proud of myself
for helping alan.</i>

17:37.837 --> 17:41.240
<i>And I wasn't naive. I knew
he had a long road ahead.</i>

17:41.241 --> 17:42.875
<i>But maybe, just maybe...</i>

17:42.876 --> 17:45.944
Having someone believe in him
was all he needed.

17:45.945 --> 17:48.280
Have I got something
to show you. (grunts)

17:50.483 --> 17:52.384
Honestly, I can't think
of anything

17:52.385 --> 17:54.586
That could make this moment
more delicious.

17:54.587 --> 17:56.955
Alan?
Who are you?

17:56.956 --> 17:58.590
More delicious.

17:58.591 --> 18:02.394
I love when movies end
the way you hope they will.
You saw this coming?

18:02.395 --> 18:04.029
Everyone saw this coming.

18:04.030 --> 18:07.566
Not dr. D.
Really? Would you like
to know the deal

18:07.567 --> 18:09.935
Your precious dr. D. Made
with me in my office?

18:09.936 --> 18:12.404
If I agree to do this,

18:12.405 --> 18:16.975
You have to promise
that I'll get to be there

18:16.976 --> 18:19.177
I'll do what I can.
Then I'm in.

18:19.178 --> 18:21.113
He even bet me
a triple c-note

18:21.114 --> 18:24.049
That alan here
wouldn't make it a week.
I don't believe you.

18:24.050 --> 18:26.084
Hey, big perr, I want
my winnings in all fives

18:26.085 --> 18:28.086
Or my own number 1 sign.
Your call.

18:39.565 --> 18:41.533
How could you do that
to me?

18:41.534 --> 18:44.469
I know you can't see it
right now,

18:44.470 --> 18:46.538
But this is good for you.

18:46.539 --> 18:50.142
Yeah, as good
as my mom's fish biscuits.

18:50.143 --> 18:52.010
They're bad.
Ah.

18:52.011 --> 18:53.946
Look, lucy,
at--at some point,

18:53.947 --> 18:57.616
Every doctor needs to learn
about lost causes like alan.

18:57.617 --> 19:00.786
I just thought I'd come along
for the ride with you.

19:00.787 --> 19:03.155
Why?
Because when it happened
to me,

19:03.156 --> 19:05.657
There was no one around
to talk to me about it after.

19:05.658 --> 19:08.760
If you're gonna survive
as a doctor,

19:08.761 --> 19:11.997
You have to stop trying to
change things you can't change.

19:11.998 --> 19:14.800
So I'm supposed to never try
and help anybody like alan?

19:14.801 --> 19:17.803
No. Because if you're gonna
survive as a person,

19:17.804 --> 19:21.506
You can never stop trying to
change things you can't change.

19:21.507 --> 19:23.075
My head hurts.

19:23.076 --> 19:25.844
(chuckles) get used to it.

19:25.845 --> 19:29.047
I just wanted alan
to end up okay.

19:29.048 --> 19:31.883
You're doing good.

19:34.787 --> 19:37.522
<i>I think what dr. Dorian
was saying--</i>

19:37.523 --> 19:39.791
<i>Although it's never that clear
with him--</i>

19:39.792 --> 19:42.728
<i>Is that you have to keep
putting yourself out there</i>

19:42.729 --> 19:45.497
<i>And just hope that you get
something back.</i>

19:45.498 --> 19:49.468
Hey, stick.
What's your last name?

19:49.469 --> 19:51.303
Mahoney.

19:51.304 --> 19:55.173
I like that. Soou still want
to grab that beer and talk?

19:55.174 --> 19:58.110
Not really.

19:58.111 --> 20:00.645
But I will.
Great.

20:00.646 --> 20:02.581
I got you something.

20:04.584 --> 20:07.719
Is that cole's mom? (laughs) yeah.
I introduced 'em.

20:07.720 --> 20:10.422
You're gonna hit that,
aren't you?

20:10.423 --> 20:12.591
Like a big rig with no brakes.

20:12.592 --> 20:14.526
Wow. That was disgusting.

20:14.527 --> 20:17.596
Yeah. Let's get out of here, huh?
Yeah. I could use a drink.

20:17.597 --> 20:20.532
I don't really drink anymore.
That's cool. You can drive.

20:20.533 --> 20:23.668
I don't really drive either.
You're weird. I like that.
