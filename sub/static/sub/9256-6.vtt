00:02.080 --> 00:03.760
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.960 --> 00:06.000
Hooker murders are up
for the East Side.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.760
Forget about making a name for
yourself as a great serial-killer hunter.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.160
- He had a knife.
- The john?

00:12.360 --> 00:16.560
I go to put the condom on, and
the asshole hit me. He tried to rape me.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.240
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.640
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.520
The street ain't seen blow this strong
since Grandmaster Flash.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.840
You're certain there were six bricks?

00:28.160 --> 00:30.720
Six or seven. Definitely more than four.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.479
Where's Mackey?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.800
- Where is it?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.240
Hey, treat yourself to a full
cavity search if you like.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.000
- You took my Ding Dongs, didn't you?
- Right.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.600
Stay away from me and stay away
from my desk.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.600
Oh, you've gotta be shitting me.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.320
Christ. How old is this one, 13?

01:01.480 --> 01:03.280
Oh, man.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.560
Hooker? Facedown like the other four?

01:08.840 --> 01:10.280
Looks that way.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.120
I warned you about this guy.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.720
Yes, you did.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.120
Couple saw a green car cruising
back and forth about an hour ago.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.200
- They get a make?
- Just said it was green.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.240
- What about the driver?
- Too dark.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.240
- Taillight was busted.
- Right or left?

01:23.520 --> 01:26.600
- They didn't say.
- Go back. Grill them. Every detail.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.840
This happened on our turf.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.280
You give me the resources,
I'll get this guy.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.440
What resources?

01:34.640 --> 01:37.040
Everybody you can spare
for as long as you can.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.800
- Personnel's stretched thin as it is.
- I need 48 hours.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.760
- I can't do it.
- A predator was standing right here...

01:44.920 --> 01:47.600
...less than two hours ago.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.440
How committed are we
to catching him?

01:52.560 --> 01:56.000
For the next 24 hours,
she's your one and only case.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.920
Medical examiner's initial report tells
us the victim is 12 to 14 years of age.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.120
A 12- to 14-year-old hooker.
Frank, you and your boys...

02:04.280 --> 02:07.200
...round up every pimp and pro
you can find. Bring them here.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.880
Neighbours saw a green car pass
the park before the body was found.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.840
The right rear taillight was broken.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.640
Check every gas station, car wash,
valet guy in the neighbourhood.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.760
June, put together a reward flier:
Photo of the girl...

02:19.920 --> 02:22.360
...mention the broken light on the car.
- Got it.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.080
She had some keys. Vic, your guys find
a locksmith and track the numbers.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.080
- Excuse me?
- Sit down with a locksmith.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.640
You want me, I'll be out on the street
finding the prick who did this.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.720
Either we get our unsub
in the next 24 hours...

02:37.920 --> 02:41.480
...or we probably don't get another
chance until he kills again.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.560
Let's go.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.240
Vic!

02:46.480 --> 02:48.560
Yes, Herr Wagenbach?

02:48.760 --> 02:51.800
You got a problem with me running
the show, take the night off.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.520
- I thought you wanted this case solved.
- I do.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.480
You just wanna be
the one who solves it.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.240
And when I do, I don't want it thrown
out of court because of your tactics.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.760
Get something straight.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.760
Somebody kills a girl
in my back yard, I get involved.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.120
- I'll crack this case with or without you.
- It'll have to be with.

03:08.280 --> 03:12.320
I run this investigation. You find
something, you report it immediately.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.440
I bring the guy in, you'll be
the first to know, Dutchboy.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074

03:27.600 --> 03:31.280
People see me as a joke around here.
They don't know the real me.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.400
- I'm not sure the squad's ready for that.
- I'm not a joke.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.760
- I know that.
- Well, now they'll know it too.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.520
I'm gonna get this guy.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.240
It's a little early to be
making promises, isn't it?

03:42.400 --> 03:45.280
One thing they respect is success.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.760
Well, I guess we better nail this guy,
then. What do we got?

03:50.080 --> 03:52.640
Body found at midnight...

03:52.840 --> 03:55.840
...green car seen
in the park at 11.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.640
Victim has no identification.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.040
Prostitute. Age 12 to 14.
Had a sweet tooth.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.920
Birth control pills.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.480
Don't make 12-year-olds
like they used to.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.960
I was wondering what was going on
with the Strike Team thing.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.519
The apartment turned up empty for
cocaine. We have no proof of his guilt.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.560
That doesn't mean
they didn't steal those drugs.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.040
I know.
But without hard evidence...

04:22.240 --> 04:26.200
I saw them pocket it. Get the car thief
to testify she found it in the truck.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.480
- It's not that easy.
- Why not?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.400
I'm not gonna put you
in a position to carry that weight.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.480
I thought you wanted Mackey
off the streets.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.960
More than you know.
Which is also why I won't let you do it.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.720
- Captain, I don't understand.
- Exactly. You don't understand.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.440
So take my advice and let this go.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.440
- Captain, I saw them pocket two...
- Julien.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.400
Let this go.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.040
How you doing?

04:55.280 --> 04:57.400
Been working my ass off.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.800
Might be time to take a vacation.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.640
Can't afford to.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.960
Had to drop my price.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.120
- Why?
- Would you pay top dollar for this?

05:13.080 --> 05:14.920
Guess it could be worse.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.240
Found her a few hours ago.
Know who she is?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.240
- She works kitty-corner from Tracy.
- Where?

05:20.400 --> 05:22.720
Across from the burrito joint,
next to that check-cashing place.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.760
Know who pimps her out?

05:25.840 --> 05:27.440
No.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.960
But Tracy would.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.440
Thanks.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.480
This guy has a thing
for working girls.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.040
- Make sure someone's watching you.
- I thought that's what you did.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.120
I don't wanna see you
get hurt again.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.320
I won't let it happen twice.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.640
Does anyone know who this girl is?

05:53.320 --> 05:54.760
Look at it.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.600
Who knows her?

05:57.080 --> 05:58.760
Hey, that's Sally.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.280
Sally who?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.920
Sally Struthers?

06:04.160 --> 06:07.360
- All in the Family.
- I know who Sally Struthers is.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.840
Maybe she saw one
of those "save the kids" ads.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.920
Whatever, that's the name she went by.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.400
Good news is, our timeline's
starting to come into focus.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.120
Her friend said Sally usually started
her shift around 10...

06:19.280 --> 06:21.200
...but didn't show last night.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.960
Another one said she saw her going
into a drugstore on Vermont at 7 p.m.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.000
You're a young girl on a Friday night,
what would you do between 7 and 10?

06:30.160 --> 06:33.400
Shop, eat, see a movie.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.800
Jim Wright, FBI. Someone called
the bureau asking for assistance?

06:36.960 --> 06:39.440
I did. Dutch Wagenbach.
You got here fast.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.680
- This is my partner, Claudette Wyms.
- Good to meet you.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.360
So...

06:44.720 --> 06:47.680
...we've got an unsub
killing hookers, huh?

06:47.880 --> 06:52.160
- Been there, done that.
- This girl was only 12, 13.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.280
You did the right thing calling us. Most
cops are afraid we're gonna come in...

06:56.440 --> 07:00.520
...step all over their toes.
- Not me. I can't wait to pick your brain.

07:00.680 --> 07:04.120
Well, let me be clear.
This is your case.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.760
I'm just here to help.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.440
Hey!

07:10.800 --> 07:14.560
What are you boys chewing? A little
grilled Snoopy, side of Woodstock?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.040
We're clean.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.280
- Think about trying a rib eye?
- What do you want?

07:20.480 --> 07:22.960
- You remember your friend Sally?
- Nope.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.880
Really. Never pimped her out?

07:25.040 --> 07:26.840
- Nope.
- You know absolutely nothing?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.720
- Less than nothing.
- Really?

07:28.920 --> 07:32.640
So that apartment on Western, where
you keep all that fenced electronics...

07:32.760 --> 07:34.560
...you don't remember that either?

07:34.760 --> 07:38.200
- Wanna make Robbery Division's day?
- Oh, yeah. Sounds sweet.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.840
Very sweet.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.000
I'll call in the warrant.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.360
Hey, lady, where's the phone?

07:44.520 --> 07:47.320
- It's over there.
- Yeah, okay.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.360
- You were pimping her out?
- She came to us. We did her a favour.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.400
- So you never took a cut?
- Twenty percent.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.120
Plus a few free pokes a week.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.200
Wipe those smiles off your faces,
shitheads.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.800
You don't score points with me
banging 12-year-olds.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.640
What kind of work did she do
before tricking for you?

08:11.960 --> 08:14.400
I heard she worked this sex club.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.160
- She was a kid.
- So?

08:17.320 --> 08:19.800
So, what kind of work
could she do for a sex club?

08:19.960 --> 08:23.720
- You'll have to ask them.
- Oh, don't worry. I will.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.040
I'm impressed you were able
to pick up on this guy.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.040
I've done a lot of research on
criminology, Behavioural Science Unit.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.159
Shows.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.960
Hey, Dutch.

08:35.159 --> 08:39.120
I got a gas-station attendant here who
says he might've seen your green car.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.159
Detective, I got a guy saw our flier.
Said he sold drugs to the victim earlier.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.400
Gotta love it when a case gets warm.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.400
So I'm working and see
a suspicious white guy...

08:49.560 --> 08:51.280
Suspicious how?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.320
Well, he was white.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.920
I go out to look at him and he turned
away, didn't want me to see his face.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.560
- Tell me about the car.
- It was green.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.000
Two-door? Four-door?
Ford? Chevy?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.400
You do work in a gas station, right?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.720
I just run the register.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.560
You sell Sally drugs tonight?

09:10.760 --> 09:14.200
- She had a thing for ecstasy.
- You're admitting to a crime?

09:14.520 --> 09:17.800
I'm a minor. My lawyer can argue
it was for personal use.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.640
Was Sally for personal use too?

09:21.840 --> 09:24.880
- She was a customer.
- Did you know she was a prostitute?

09:25.240 --> 09:27.520
How do you think she paid me?

09:29.640 --> 09:33.480
- I gave her five hits around 8:30.
- Five. She always buy that much?

09:33.680 --> 09:35.480
Said it got her through the night.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.040
So...

09:37.200 --> 09:39.280
...how much is this reward?
- Reward?

09:39.800 --> 09:43.920
For useful information. You know,
like the flier said. That's why I'm here.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.440
So, what's my reward?

09:46.080 --> 09:49.800
Dealing drugs to a minor,
statutory rape.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.960
- How does six months to a year sound?
- What?

09:53.280 --> 09:56.000
- Get a licence plate number?
- Better. I got evidence.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.360
- Did he pay with a credit card?
- No, man, cash.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.640
The dude paid with a 20 at the
teller, and he only pumped 17.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.560
He never came back for his change.
Who doesn't want $3 change back?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.160
- So you kept the 20?
- No.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.760
That was part of the deposit at the
end of my shift. I saved his change.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.120
- You saved $3 in change?
- Yeah, dust them for fingerprints.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.400
- But he never touched them.
- No, but it's his $3.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.680
It's gotta help somehow, right?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.600
- Captain, we've got a problem.
- What is it?

10:24.760 --> 10:27.360
The toilets in the women's
bathroom aren't working.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.240
- What do you mean, not working?
- They're clogged.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.200
Don't look at me.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.840
- So now we have no working toilets?
- Right.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.600
- Did you call Maintenance?
- They can't come till tomorrow.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.480
- Call a plumber, then.
- Who will pay?

10:39.640 --> 10:42.840
Use my credit card.
Just get someone down here.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.400
Hey, buddy.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.880
Imagine meeting you here.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.160
- Excuse me?
- You remember me. Vic.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.680
- Your best friend from Boston.
- Never been to Boston.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.480
- Come on!
- Hey!

11:00.640 --> 11:02.240
Come on.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.280
Ted, you remember. We went
to high school together.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.960
- Give me my wallet. I don't know you!
- Oh, right.

11:08.120 --> 11:11.440
Now you're gonna tell me you
weren't about to go into that sex club.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.400
- Sex club? That's a sex club?
- Yeah, Ted.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.160
Members only.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.960
And tonight I'm your guest.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.200
Thanks for taking me
on such short notice.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.880
Ted is one of our best clients.
We like to keep him happy.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.440
Sounds like you do a great job of that.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.160
Will you be watching or taking part
tonight, Vic?

11:32.320 --> 11:35.960
Watching. I like to test the waters
before I jump in.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.880
You'll be watching Sun-Lee tonight.

11:40.040 --> 11:43.320
- Excellent.
- We have tapes if you're interested.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.560
I'm sure I will be.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.440
I won't pull any punches.
She's critical.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.560
She? You mean the pipes?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.360
You eat well?
Get a physical once a year?

11:57.520 --> 12:00.360
- Flush out your pipes regularly?
- I see where you're going.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.040
Right. Maintaining a sewage
system is no different.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.400
- Can you get them working or not?
- I'll see what I can do.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.320
Why have you been making noises
about contacting IAD?

12:10.640 --> 12:13.360
- Who told you that?
- You think word wouldn't get out?

12:13.520 --> 12:16.360
- It was just a question.
- Why do you wanna talk to IAD?

12:16.520 --> 12:18.320
Because I saw something.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.840
- Saw what?
- You don't wanna know.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.200
Forget about the what, then.
Hey, who are you talking about?

12:24.360 --> 12:28.280
I'm not talking about anyone. The more
I say, the less people wanna listen.

12:28.440 --> 12:32.960
People around here prefer just to cover
things up and hope I'll just shut up.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.160
Hey, what about my wallet?

13:41.560 --> 13:45.320
I ever see you near here again, your
wife's getting a very unpleasant call.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.160
Screw.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.680
- Hello.
- Billy. It's Vic.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.760
Sorry to call you so late. I got probable
cause for a no-knock warrant.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.840
- What was that all about?
- I saw what I saw. I can't let it lie.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.400
Goddamn it, you don't know
what you're doing here.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.880
- I know right from wrong, captain.
- I told you to let this go.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.920
I may answer to you, but I also answer
to God. I won't be at peace with him...

14:10.080 --> 14:13.160
...or myself if I turn my back on this.
- You wanna do this?

14:13.320 --> 14:16.200
You really wanna do this?
Because here's what's gonna happen:

14:16.360 --> 14:18.760
Most cops here will treat you
like a traitor.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.240
You'll take more shit
than you've ever taken before.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.800
You're gonna be testifying
against Vic Mackey.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.560
And trust me, he doesn't care
if God is on your side.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.120
Are you ready for that kind of heat?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.280
I'll have to be.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.800
Warrant! Police! Get against the wall!
Hands up! Get against the wall!

14:37.000 --> 14:39.680
Get on your knees right now!
Get down!

14:43.800 --> 14:48.160
On your knees! Get in a line!
Come on, girls, what's wrong with you?

14:48.920 --> 14:50.840
Where are the tapes?

14:58.320 --> 15:00.400
"Cherrypopper Films."

15:00.680 --> 15:02.880
You really take the cake,
don't you, lady?

15:03.040 --> 15:04.520
Come on, back off!

15:05.000 --> 15:06.840
Ready? Let's go!

15:08.080 --> 15:09.760
Come on, now.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.880
Vic! Vic.

15:12.320 --> 15:16.200
- What do you wanna do with the girl?
- Keep her in the Clubhouse for now.

15:16.400 --> 15:19.840
- Where the hell's Shockley and Peters?
- Robbery-homicide call.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.240
What? They're supposed to be
going over witness statements.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.280
It's a robbery-homicide, Dutch.
It's only two men.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.440
Oh, for God's sake.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.200
Quick, get that box.

15:36.360 --> 15:41.200
- Oh, jeez. Get my files and Rolodex!
- Put what you can on top of your desks.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.080
- Come on, get me that other file.
- Which one? This one?

15:46.520 --> 15:48.920
You got a big problem
with these pipes.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.800
Just what I need.
Goddamn flood in my workspace.

15:55.960 --> 16:00.320
- I did up a quickie profile on our killer.
- What do you got?

16:01.280 --> 16:04.160
Our unsub's late 20s, early 30s.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.000
Sporadic employment.
Feels unappreciated, worthless.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.840
Why does he pose them facedown?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.600
Symbolises the domination
he yearns for.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.120
He's probably impotent, though,
at least with a live girl.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.080
Dutch, we got a hit off the flier.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.280
Tipster says he saw a guy
with Sally in a green vehicle.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.240
- We get the caller's address?
- Right here.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.360
Yes.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.040
You better get out there
and clean it anyway.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.800
Well, I got another
couple of buckets.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.920
These are closed off over here.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.640
Tom Ross.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.040
The flier said it was confidential.
How did you get my address?

16:56.200 --> 16:58.640
Tip line's routed through 911.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.680
If this guy's a killer,
I don't want him coming after me.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.319
Your name doesn't leave
this room, Tom.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.920
Just tell us what you saw.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.119
Okay. Basically, I was out last night...

17:09.280 --> 17:12.680
...driving and I was stopped
at a light behind this green car.

17:12.839 --> 17:15.800
There was a guy driving, and it
seemed he was having a struggle...

17:15.960 --> 17:19.240
...with a girl in the passenger seat.
- The girl from the flier?

17:19.640 --> 17:20.720
I think so.

17:20.880 --> 17:25.000
I was behind them, but it looked weird,
so I wrote the licence plate down.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.760
Did you see if one of his
taillights was broken?

17:28.319 --> 17:29.680
I think so.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.880
Yeah.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.800
Run this plate. Cross-reference it,
get me a DMV photo.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.800
- Computers are down.
- What?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.960
- They were unplugged due to flooding.
- Goddamn it.

17:41.120 --> 17:44.320
Then call Central. Have them run it.
Fax over a photo.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.160
The fax machine's unplugged too.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.160
Then send someone over to Central
to pick up the photo.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.480
- Who should I send?
- Just take care of this one thing for me!

17:52.640 --> 17:55.760
Each of my workers had documentation
saying they were 18.

17:55.920 --> 18:01.160
- From what? A cereal box?
- I said, I want to see my lawyer.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.240
- What do you got here?
- Busted an underage sex shop.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.720
- Looks like a cherrypopper raid too.
- Cherrypopper?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.960
Preteen girls losing their virginity.
The filmmaker's next on my list.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.480
- What's the connection to our hooker?
- She worked there a few months ago.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.560
How does that help me find out
what happened last night?

18:17.760 --> 18:20.720
- It doesn't.
- So you've been doing your own thing.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.120
Hey, don't chew up my ass just
because your case is coming up short.

18:24.280 --> 18:28.880
You couldn't help me by simply
tracking down the victim's keys?

18:29.080 --> 18:31.120
I was putting a teenage sex show
out of business.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.480
And I'm trying to catch a killer,
asshole.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.040
Jesus Christ.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.920
We gotta watch these,
find out who's behind them.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.320
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know. I can't stomach this shit.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.520
Yell if you find anything.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.040
Hi, Steve.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.320
I'm Detective Wagenbach.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.280
What's going on?
Why am I down here?

19:03.600 --> 19:07.240
Your name came up in
an investigation of ours.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.040
Investigation? Of what?

19:10.280 --> 19:13.720
- Drive a '97 green Saturn, Steve?
- Yeah.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.360
Is that a good car?

19:16.520 --> 19:20.320
- I guess, yeah.
- Reliable? No problems with it?

19:20.920 --> 19:24.360
- I had some work done on the brakes.
- What about the taillights?

19:24.720 --> 19:27.480
- Taillights?
- Any broken taillights on your car?

19:27.840 --> 19:29.520
No.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.160
You sure?

19:31.320 --> 19:32.880
I don't think so.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.640
Because we checked
your car out, Steve.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.520
You checked out my car?

19:38.360 --> 19:39.360
<i>Why?</i>

19:39.880 --> 19:42.640
You got a broken right taillight.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.600
Okay.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.440
Hey.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.040
What happen me now?

20:00.480 --> 20:01.680
Well...

20:02.040 --> 20:04.680
You get to play blackjack with Vic.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.960
Not in trouble?

20:07.920 --> 20:10.680
Only if you take me
for all my money.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.560
Who made you work for Mrs. Park?

20:19.760 --> 20:24.880
Mrs. Park help me. She pay ticket.
Ten thousand dollar.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.320
She's not helping you.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.480
She help me star in more movies.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.160
Nineteen.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.920
You understand that what you did...

20:39.200 --> 20:41.560
...that's not a real movie.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.120
It start, though.

20:47.560 --> 20:51.320
Fifteen. Vic is forced to hit.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.800
Ten. That's a bust.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
You win.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.640
Sun-Lee win?

20:59.320 --> 21:01.080
Yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.680
You popular in high school, Steve?

21:08.760 --> 21:10.280
I had friends.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.480
It's not really the same thing, is it?

21:13.720 --> 21:18.240
You can always find another dork to eat
lunch with. Doesn't make you popular.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.280
Guess not.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.240
The reason I'm curious about
your high-school years, Steve, is...

21:25.400 --> 21:27.240
...you've got a sealed juvie record.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.560
You're not supposed to know
about that.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.760
We know about it. We just don't know
exactly what your crime was.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.120
How about cluing me in?

21:36.280 --> 21:38.440
- No.
- A little embarrassing, is it?

21:38.600 --> 21:42.120
Hey, either tell me what I'm doing here
or I'm leaving.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.040
- I don't have to tell you anything.
- Fine. I'm going, then.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.360
You're not going anywhere.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.880
Oh, hey, sunshine. How you doing?

21:58.040 --> 22:00.000
This bathroom thing's
a real nightmare.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.720
Don't worry about it.
High tide's not for a few more hours.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.000
Listen, Vic.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.840
There's something you should...

22:09.000 --> 22:11.560
- Forget it.
- No, no, no, no, no. Too late.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.480
- Come on.
- I really shouldn't.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.520
- Oh, you're breaking my heart.
- I can get fired for telling you.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.720
What if we keep it between us,
sunshine?

22:25.720 --> 22:28.760
David just had me
put a call in to IAD.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.640
IAD? Goddamn it.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.920
I can't believe he'd do this to you.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.760
It's not me I'm worried about.
I didn't do anything.

22:38.920 --> 22:43.480
I just know that your guy's already not
fitting in. He makes a mistake like this.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.320
As his training officer, I just don't want
any of that mud sticking to you.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.960
- I'll talk to him.
- Don't be too hard.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.680
He's a good kid. He means well.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.600
He's just confused.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.280
I can't talk about it.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.920
- You're going to IAD about Vic?
- It's really none of your business.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.680
- You're my partner. It's my business.
- Can we just let this rest?

23:04.880 --> 23:07.280
Look, Vic is a great cop.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.120
You don't testify against a fellow
officer until you look him in the eye...

23:11.280 --> 23:14.680
...and hear their side of the story.
- I don't know what your deal is...

23:14.840 --> 23:18.360
...but it can't change what happened.
- You're wrong. Let Vic explain...

23:18.560 --> 23:21.080
You can't explain stealing evidence.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.640
That's right, Danny. He stole two bricks
of cocaine, and I saw him.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.560
And whether you realise it or not,
you helped him cover it up.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.920
Now stop asking me about this.

23:38.240 --> 23:42.720
File says you haven't held a steady job
in more than three months, Steve.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.320
- Economy stinks.
- You must be angry.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.800
Nobody likes to feel unappreciated.

23:48.960 --> 23:52.080
- Worthless.
- I don't feel that way.

23:53.280 --> 23:57.280
No, you're a powerful guy.
Where were you last night around 11?

23:57.720 --> 24:01.600
- At home, in bed.
- Anyone to corroborate that?

24:02.080 --> 24:03.960
That I was in bed?

24:04.120 --> 24:06.760
- I wish.
- Wish what? For a girl in your bed?

24:06.920 --> 24:10.000
- That you could actually get it up?
- What are you talking about?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.840
What's so private about
this sealed record of yours?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.640
- It's sealed.
- What are you hiding?

24:14.800 --> 24:19.920
You a peeping Tom?
Stalker? Like to kill cats? What?

24:22.520 --> 24:24.880
I broke into my high school.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.040
- I trashed the place.
- Sure. I can see that.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.320
You like to destroy things,
don't you, Steve?

24:34.440 --> 24:35.840
Hey, Dutch!

24:36.000 --> 24:39.280
We just found Sally in one of these
cherrypopper tapes. Come on.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.000
While your lawyer's on the way...

24:44.440 --> 24:47.400
...we're gonna have
a little screening party.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.720
We'll watch that tape
until one of two things happens:

24:51.320 --> 24:54.600
Either you're gonna tell me
everything you know about Sally...

24:54.760 --> 24:56.720
...or I'm gonna have to turn it off.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.040
But if I have to turn that tape off...

25:00.720 --> 25:03.640
...there are no more rules
in this room.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.600
Right there. Yeah.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.280
Turn it off.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.360
I got her from Kurt Schmidt.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.520
He makes the movies.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.560
And how do I find Kurt?

26:07.160 --> 26:09.280
You okay?

26:09.880 --> 26:11.720
That was Sally.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.720
She's a kid.

26:16.680 --> 26:18.360
She was.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.440
- The asshole who made her do that...
- Don't worry. He's mine.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.800
Good.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.120
Ramirez just called in.
14-year-old kid saw the flier.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.960
Says he's Sally's boyfriend.

26:35.240 --> 26:39.560
- Why would someone do that to her?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.600
You were Sally's boyfriend?

26:43.320 --> 26:47.080
- Yeah.
- When was the last time you saw her?

26:47.560 --> 26:50.200
Last night.
We met at this ice-cream place.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.480
What time was that?

26:52.760 --> 26:56.360
- She left right before 10.
- Are you sure?

26:56.520 --> 26:59.880
Yeah. That's when her curfew is.
She has to be home by 10.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.440
- Where did she live?
- I never saw her house.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.480
She said her parents were traditional,
didn't let her have boys over.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.080
And she was your girlfriend
for how long?

27:09.280 --> 27:13.000
A few months. But it only started
getting serious last week.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.760
Serious?

27:14.920 --> 27:18.120
Well, that's when she
finally kissed me.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.080
She was young.
She wanted to take it slow.

27:22.240 --> 27:26.440
Did you have any idea
what Sally did for a living?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.520
She was a freshman, right?

27:34.520 --> 27:36.840
Hi, Vic. Play cards?

27:37.240 --> 27:41.400
Later. Right now I need you to show me
the guy who made your movie.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.080
How come?

27:43.240 --> 27:45.520
To help me with my case.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.760
I helped you out, right?

27:47.920 --> 27:50.240
You think you could help me out too?

27:50.520 --> 27:52.440
- Yes.
- Good.

27:52.600 --> 27:57.200
- Vic mad at Sun-Lee?
- Oh, no. Not at you.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.800
You should be with your family,
being a kid.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.440
Which one is he?

28:05.040 --> 28:08.320
Him. That man put me in movie.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.160
I can't talk about it.

28:19.160 --> 28:23.800
Look, I just haven't been a good
listener or a good training officer.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.720
I was scared to believe you.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.360
- Believe him, then.
- No.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.800
I wanna believe the truth.

28:34.960 --> 28:39.000
If you just tell me what the truth is,
I promise I'll listen.

28:40.520 --> 28:44.760
So she's at the ice-cream store
here at 9:45.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.880
She heads to work at 10.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.480
Fastest way to her corner's here.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.200
Which means she was picked up
on Cassandra Street.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.720
- Yeah.
- Forget a full confession.

28:55.880 --> 28:59.400
All you have to do is get him to admit
he was on Cassandra at 10:00.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.240
You get him to say that...

29:01.440 --> 29:03.880
...with all the circumstantial
evidence, you got him.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.840
I'll get him to say it.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.360
Ding Dong?

29:10.200 --> 29:12.280
No, thanks.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.320
I think we're almost done here,
Steve.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.680
Hey!

29:21.280 --> 29:23.320
- Kurt Schmidt?
- Yeah.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.480
- You're under arrest.
- For what, man?

29:25.640 --> 29:27.480
Making movies.

29:27.640 --> 29:32.000
- Get off me, man. I'm an editor.
- Cherrypopper movies, you sick prick.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.080
You can't prove that.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.320
I got tapes and witnesses, asshole.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.520
Only question left is whether you...

29:38.680 --> 29:41.720
...took a header into the concrete
trying to resist arrest.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.360
- You got a girlfriend, Steve?
- No.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
I remember my 20s.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.200
Rough times.

29:49.360 --> 29:52.520
Too old for the college girls,
too young for the mature ones.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.840
- What do you mean?
- Not being able to get a date.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.600
Get laid.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.040
Pisses you off.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.200
Aren't I, like, entitled to a lawyer
or something?

30:03.360 --> 30:05.080
Entitled?

30:05.480 --> 30:07.240
You, entitled?

30:09.400 --> 30:13.800
What about Kitty Weir or Rosita
Pedraza? What about Mary Esposito?

30:13.960 --> 30:17.760
What about Sheryl Watkins?
What about Sally, Steve?

30:18.880 --> 30:20.920
What were they entitled to?

30:21.080 --> 30:23.800
- I don't wanna look at those.
- You don't like your work?

30:23.960 --> 30:28.320
Is that why they're facedown? So you
don't have to look after you kill them?

30:28.480 --> 30:31.840
- You think I killed those girls?
- I know you killed them, Steve.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.040
No way!

30:34.880 --> 30:36.480
Fine.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.440
Fine.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
You didn't kill them.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.720
But at least don't lie to me
about where you were last night.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.800
I'm not.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.320
We have a witness...

30:53.000 --> 30:58.120
...who saw you in your green car
on Cassandra Street...

30:58.400 --> 31:02.920
...with the broken taillight at 10:00.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.440
So don't lie to me.

31:06.720 --> 31:11.320
At least tell me the truth
about this one thing.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.920
Witness?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.160
You're not talking about Tom,
are you?

31:19.680 --> 31:22.520
- Tom?
- Yeah.

31:22.680 --> 31:26.880
Tom Ross. Is he the one
who says he saw me?

31:30.440 --> 31:33.160
Oh, Jesus, it's Tom, isn't it?

31:34.000 --> 31:37.080
- This one just raised the bar.
- Raised the bar?

31:37.240 --> 31:39.920
For practical jokes.
It's a prank, man.

31:40.360 --> 31:44.440
We always try to one-up each other and
he probably heard about the girls and...

31:44.640 --> 31:47.880
Dude, man, you scared the shit
out of me with that!

31:48.640 --> 31:50.240
<i>- A prank?
- Oh, shit.</i>

31:50.400 --> 31:52.520
Is Tom here right now?
Please tell me he's here.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.160
He's here.

31:54.320 --> 31:58.760
Great. Dude, you gotta do me a favour.
You gotta help me get him back.

31:58.880 --> 32:03.080
When you see him, you gotta act
like you're super pissed and tell him...

32:03.360 --> 32:07.000
...tell him he's under arrest
for something like...

32:07.200 --> 32:09.760
- Obstruction of justice?
- Perfect.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.960
- It was just a joke.
- And the taillight?

32:12.120 --> 32:14.160
I saw it on the flier, so I busted his.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.880
- You realise what you did?
- Have a sense of humour.

32:17.040 --> 32:20.360
A girl's killer's still out there
because you're a goddamn clown.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.920
Hey, hey. Easy. Easy.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.160
The guy who murdered Sally's still
out there, and I'm here...

32:25.320 --> 32:28.680
...with my dick in my hand because
this guy thought it'd be funny...

32:28.840 --> 32:32.400
...to rake his buddy over the coals.
- All right.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.440
Screw him.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.360
- You still got time.
- I just wasted seven hours. Gone.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.320
I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.960
Hey, Dutch.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.360
You got a job to do. Do it.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.800
Connie?

32:55.000 --> 32:58.160
Jesus Christ. What happened?

32:58.720 --> 33:01.480
He's the killer maybe, right?

33:10.160 --> 33:13.760
He's an insurance salesman from
Fresno. What did you do here?

33:13.960 --> 33:17.000
- He was acting strange.
- So you shot him?

33:17.200 --> 33:20.880
- I didn't want him to hurt me.
- How much have you been smoking?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.920
You gotta help me, Vic.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.960
Christ, Connie!

33:26.920 --> 33:30.200
- Can't you say you shot him?
- At least 10 cops can place me...

33:30.360 --> 33:34.200
...at the Barn when this went down.
- I thought that he was gonna kill me!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.360
Well, that story's not gonna cut it.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.800
I'll lose my son.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.680
Vic, please!

33:42.240 --> 33:44.280
Think of something!

33:47.920 --> 33:49.920
What is it?

33:50.480 --> 33:53.280
No. Clean yourself up.
I gotta call this in.

33:53.480 --> 33:56.480
You thought of something, Vic.
I know you did.

33:56.640 --> 34:01.400
- I'm sorry, Connie, my hands are tied.
- All I have is Brian.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.160
Don't let me lose him.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.600
You'll need a better story.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.400
Okay.

34:15.560 --> 34:18.600
All right. You had sex.
You asked him to pay.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.960
He said he didn't have to pay,
that he was gonna make you pay.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.719
He started hitting you.
He took out his gun.

34:24.880 --> 34:28.040
You fought him off,
you took it and shot him.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.199
Do you have that?

34:30.920 --> 34:33.480
I asked him to pay.

34:33.639 --> 34:38.080
He said he didn't have to
and he hit me. That's good.

34:38.719 --> 34:41.560
Your friends, they'll believe that?

34:42.560 --> 34:45.520
Only if you have the bruises
to prove it.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.760
Okay.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.920
- I can't, Connie.
- It's okay, Vic. Come on!

35:11.080 --> 35:12.440
- No.
- Do it!

35:12.600 --> 35:14.600
- No.
- Hit me!

35:14.800 --> 35:16.080
- Hit me!
- No!

35:16.240 --> 35:17.240
- Hit me!
- No!

35:17.400 --> 35:19.800
- Come on, Vic, hit me.
- No.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.080
Please.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.560
Vic, please.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.640
Please.

35:36.240 --> 35:38.000
Hit me.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.040
So where does that leave us?

35:54.200 --> 35:57.840
We know she disappeared on
Cassandra Street. So far, no witnesses.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.240
- Anything from the park?
- I did a full sweep. Nothing.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.840
- Well, maybe Forensics will...
- No.

36:04.280 --> 36:07.200
This guy didn't leave any forensics
on the first victims.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.160
He's only gonna get better,
not sloppier.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.360
- In that case, I'm calling the units off.
- What?

36:12.520 --> 36:16.240
A brawl broke out at Council Rock
High, 60 students from rival schools.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.760
- I need everyone I can get over there.
- You promised me 24 hours.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.680
I'm sorry, Dutch.
I just don't have the bodies.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.040
So a dead hooker gets 21 hours?

36:29.200 --> 36:32.000
What would she get
if she was the mayor's daughter?

36:32.320 --> 36:34.680
Claudette is gonna go back
into rotation.

36:34.840 --> 36:39.800
Now you show me some new evidence,
clues, a viable lead, and then we'll talk.

36:40.400 --> 36:44.680
You'll assign the same amount of men
to find a killer as to fixing our pipes?

36:44.880 --> 36:49.200
- Getting mad doesn't change anything.
- She deserves better.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.080
I know.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.800
You did all you could.
It's not over.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.360
I need an aspirin.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.200
Dutch, you're soaking yourself.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.280
You okay?

37:23.560 --> 37:27.520
- Sure.
- You think we can find time to study?

37:28.160 --> 37:29.760
- What?
- For the sergeant's exam.

37:29.920 --> 37:33.520
I feel like I'm, you know,
kind of falling behind.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.400
Sure.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.640
Why don't we do that right now.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.800
I'll just drop my serial-killer
thing to help you study.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.760
Because what you want always comes
first, right? Comes before me.

37:44.920 --> 37:49.400
Comes before everybody else here.
Even comes before a dead girl...

37:49.560 --> 37:52.520
...we're all supposed to just forget
about come tomorrow.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.000
So grab your books.

37:55.160 --> 37:59.120
Let's find a nice, quiet spot.
We'll study for that test right now.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.280
We had sex.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.560
And then I asked...
Told him to pay.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.600
He said he didn't have to.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.080
That's when he started hitting me.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.040
You did good.

38:27.640 --> 38:31.000
- I'm scared.
- You're halfway home.

38:31.960 --> 38:35.000
Just tell the detectives
the same thing.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.600
I'm gonna change, Vic.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.240
I'm gonna clean up.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.240
And be a mother to Brian.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.160
It's gonna be okay.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.960
Get clean...

38:59.120 --> 39:00.480
...change...

39:00.640 --> 39:02.680
...be a good mother.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.720
I'm gonna do it.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.680
Sun-Lee.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.160
I go now?

39:16.440 --> 39:19.600
I called INS.
I'm sending you back to Korea.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.120
- But you say you help Sun-Lee.
- I am. This is the best thing for you.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.480
- You don't know what like there.
- I know what it's like here.

39:26.640 --> 39:31.160
- Parents never take me back!
- If they won't, the authorities will.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.520
You'll be sent to a foster home, to
school. Someone will look after you.

39:35.720 --> 39:39.040
- Sun-Lee come back. I will.
- Maybe.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.840
And even if it only buys you
six months, I can live with that.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.240
I'm sorry.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.480
Watch your step here.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.040
Wait.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.840
Wait!

40:04.440 --> 40:06.120
Sorry.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.240
She looked like Sally.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.640
Almost was Sally.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.560
Hey, Dutch.

40:20.200 --> 40:24.080
- You showed me something today.
- What do you mean? I failed.

40:24.280 --> 40:28.320
No, no. No, you didn't. We took down
some bad guys doing some bad stuff.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.640
- You did that, not me.
- Hey, we both did it.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.720
We'll get your guy too.
Just won't be today.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.640
No, it won't.

40:38.360 --> 40:43.120
Serial cases are marathons,
not sprints.

40:43.640 --> 40:47.440
I remember working
the Green River Case in 1984.

40:48.640 --> 40:53.560
Forty-nine bodies.
Had 50 times your resources.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.680
1984.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.640
We made our first arrest last year.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.000
Doesn't hurt if you don't let it.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.840
Place should be clear by morning.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.320
Here's your bill.

41:17.680 --> 41:20.640
- Eight hundred dollars?
- Yeah. Cash only. I don't take credit.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.640
- I'll have to go to an ATM.
- No problema. I'll be here.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.720
Hey.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.720
What's up?

41:40.960 --> 41:42.920
Did you steal drugs
from those Armenians?

41:43.120 --> 41:46.680
- Oh, not you too.
- Hey, look, Vic.

41:46.960 --> 41:51.000
I owe you too much to ever repeat
your answer to anyone, but if...

41:51.200 --> 41:54.720
If I helped you get away with it,
I gotta know the truth.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.120
Did you steal drugs?

41:56.320 --> 41:59.760
You're asking this after what happened
the other night? The bust of the year...

41:59.920 --> 42:02.960
...and your partner's got
you as mixed up as he is.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.520
Just give me time to get things
sorted out in my head, okay?

42:07.640 --> 42:09.920
- Danny.
- Please.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.200
I just want some space.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.480
What I said to you...

42:30.040 --> 42:32.320
...was inexcusable.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.920
This case...

42:37.640 --> 42:40.040
...was very important to me.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.600
When I was a kid...

42:45.160 --> 42:46.800
You know what?

42:48.160 --> 42:51.800
At least I had a childhood.
I lived.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.640
It's pathetic to complain about
it now, and it's even more pathetic...

42:55.800 --> 42:58.640
...to use it as some kind of excuse.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.280
I don't have an excuse.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.000
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.480
Good night.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.240
Hey, Dutch?

43:16.280 --> 43:18.160
You hungry?

43:19.880 --> 43:22.080
Because I make a mean
grilled cheese.

44:24.720 --> 44:25.720
