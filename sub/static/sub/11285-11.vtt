WHAT'RE YOU DOING, MATT?

39:01.255 --> 39:02.838
WALK AWAY, GREG.
LET ME DO THIS.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.607
I CAN'T.

39:04.609 --> 39:07.510
NO ONE'S GONNA MISS HIM.
NO ONE'S GONNA MOURN HIM.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.912
<i> PARKER:</i>
<i> I KNOW...</i>

39:08.914 --> 39:10.613
HE PUTS GUNS IN THE HANDS
OF CHILDREN...

39:10.615 --> 39:11.948
AND SENDS THEM OUT TO KILL

39:11.950 --> 39:13.550
<i> OTHER CHILDREN,</i>
<i> WOMEN...</i>

39:13.552 --> 39:14.617
I KNOW THAT.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.753
AND WE PLAY BY THE RULES,

39:16.755 --> 39:18.888
WE FIGHT FAIR...
WHY?

39:18.890 --> 39:20.757
HUH, GREG?

39:20.758 --> 39:22.625
WHY DOES THIS MONSTER
DESERVE YOUR PROTECTION?

39:22.627 --> 39:25.095
DO I NEED TO ANSWER THAT?

39:25.097 --> 39:26.696
<i> WE'RE NOT HERE </i>
<i> TO PROTECT HIM, MATT.</i>

39:26.698 --> 39:28.932
WE'RE HERE TO PROTECT YOU.

39:31.103 --> 39:32.969
NO.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.071
WELL, I TRIED BEING
A GOOD COP...

39:35.073 --> 39:36.606
DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.675
PARKER:
DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

39:38.677 --> 39:40.410
EXCUSE ME?!

39:40.412 --> 39:42.512
THE KID UPSTAIRS SAYS OTHERWISE.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.948
DYLAN WAS SUPPOSED TO KILL YOU,
BUT HE DIDN'T.

39:44.950 --> 39:45.915
<i> BECAUSE WHEN IT CAME</i>
<i> DOWN TO IT,</i>

39:45.917 --> 39:47.684
HE KNOWS GOOD FROM BAD.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.053
AND YOU KNOW HOW?

39:50.055 --> 39:52.555
BECAUSE YOU TOOK THE TIME
TO GET TO KNOW HIM.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.491
YOU TOOK THE TIME
TO BE A PART OF HIS WORLD.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.992
YOU DID WHAT A GOOD COP DOES.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.894
YOU CARED...
YOU CARE.

39:59.631 --> 40:03.800
HE KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND THIS MURDERER.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.035
YOU GONNA PROVE HIM WRONG?

40:18.717 --> 40:21.651
<i> DON'T PROVE HIM WRONG,</i>
<i> COME ON...</i>

40:22.587 --> 40:23.653
<i> COME ON.</i>

40:24.623 --> 40:28.691

PARKER:
YOU KNOW, WHAT CLARK DID
WITH THE CELL PHONE...

41:36.528 --> 41:38.828
WE WOULDN'T HAVE COME
IN TIME.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.897
IT'S A PRETTY SMART MOVE.
IT'S PRETTY BRAVE.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.665
AND WHAT,
THAT MAKES UP FOR IT?

41:42.667 --> 41:44.701
NO. SOMETIMES DEAN
DRIVES ME CRAZY,

41:44.703 --> 41:46.069
WON'T LISTEN TO A WORD I SAY,

41:46.071 --> 41:47.070
AND OTHER TIMES
HE DOES SOMETHING

41:47.072 --> 41:48.238
THAT MAKES ME SO PROUD

41:48.240 --> 41:52.141
I THINK MY HEART'S GONNA...
JUST BURST.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.209
THING IS THAT,
MORE AND MORE,

41:57.082 --> 41:59.883
CLARK'S A GREAT KID.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.752
HE'S GOT A LOT OF YOU
IN THERE.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.092
(EXHALES)
WHAT DO WE DO?

42:12.130 --> 42:13.196
I KNOW.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.100
HOW BAD DO YOU THINK
THIS IS GONNA BE?

42:17.102 --> 42:19.068
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

42:22.974 --> 42:24.040
(BRACING GROAN)

42:25.877 --> 42:28.077
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANNA BE A COP,

42:28.079 --> 42:30.547
YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO FOLLOW THE RULES.

42:32.250 --> 42:34.851
YEAH, WE GET IT.

WANNA GRAB A PIZZA?

42:55.640 --> 42:56.706
UH, SURE.

42:58.043 --> 43:01.110
SEE, THAT'S THE OTHER THING
ABOUT BEING A COP -

43:01.112 --> 43:03.746
TEN PERCENT DISCOUNT
AT VANELLI'S.
