00:10.761 --> 00:12.434
<i>This isn't Fortitude.</i>

00:12.596 --> 00:13.722
You called London.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.857
You told him
I murdered Stoddart.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.565
<i>What is he asking her
about Billy Pettigrew now?</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:20.195
Pettigrew's
the reason he's here.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.527
<i>Ask me any question you want.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.033
<i>Whatever's happening
to us, Shirley was a victim.</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:27.945
<i>There's something else going
on-- something much worse.</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:29.283
<i>Why'd you release the teacher?</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:30.914
<i>He's obviously connected.</i>

00:31.073 --> 00:33.371
It's my turn to take the

Okay, Jules, that's
the pentobarbital stopped.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.492
Liam's going to wake up.

01:49.651 --> 01:53.576
He'll require pain management
for the frostbite damage, but...

01:53.739 --> 01:55.537
I can take him home?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.952
Medically, we've no objection.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.711
But the governor will make
that decision.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.625
What your little
boy did...

02:04.791 --> 02:07.795
God knows
what she'll decide.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.464
<i>A child...</i>

02:10.631 --> 02:12.474
murdered a stranger.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.513
A young woman attacked
her own mother.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.807
The worst thing is that
the killer's in your own home.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.271
Watching television with
you, eating with you,

02:22.434 --> 02:24.277
lying beside you
in bed at night.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.110
And could attack you
for no reason.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.447
We keep the lid
on Allerdyce.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.458
If nobody knows her condition,
then nobody knows

02:38.617 --> 02:41.837
that Liam and Shirley carried
out identical attacks.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.669
And we mustn't connect
them in public.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.458
They are connected--
they're the same.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.502
We cannot let fear take hold.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.056
I'll be back
in precisely two hours.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.735
And then we'll begin.

03:20.800 --> 03:30.800
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:51.356 --> 03:53.199
Ovaries.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.076
Penis.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.909
Male and female sex organs
developing in parallel.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.540
Do you think that the
spontaneous aborts are

04:00.699 --> 04:03.248
as a result of this
hermaphroditism.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.879
Which is a result of some
environmental factor.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.289
Maybe, though there is
another theory.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.083
Which is?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.924
The Sami reindeer herders have
accounts of similar mass events.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.339
There's whole herds
that abort and miscarry,

04:16.505 --> 04:19.350
there's whole generations
lost to hermaphroditism.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.353
And they say
it happens

04:22.512 --> 04:26.767
when a demon lives
amongst the herd.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.776
Mates with them.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.528
What do they
mean by "demon"?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.940
Well, there are other
incidences in...

04:34.566 --> 04:36.284
Hi.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.740
Hello.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.156
Come in.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.165
Hi.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.544
Was among the things we took
from the professor's study.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.544
Your name.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.579
It might be important.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.257
Hi, Nat.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.134
Hey.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.920
We should go
swimming soon.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.929
Now that fall's
here, I miss it.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.056
Yeah, me, too.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.724
You would be very welcome
to join the two of us.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.225
Yeah.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.522
Okay.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.237
Bye.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.994
It's from Charlie.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.780
He's authorized
research investigation

05:21.947 --> 05:24.075
on a protected specimen--
<i>Ursus maritimus.</i>

05:26.243 --> 05:28.291
He's left me a polar bear.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.550
A polar bear.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.969
Hey, lovely.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.049
Hello, son.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.009
If there's no sign
of necrotic debris...

06:23.758 --> 06:26.432
...I see no need
for further debridement.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.939
Frankly, his recovery
is just...

06:29.097 --> 06:30.599
it's remarkable.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.609
You're going to be okay.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.987
I'm going to take you home.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.365
He'll be
disorientated for a while.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.245
If he complains of pain
or if he's in distress...

06:43.403 --> 06:44.871
He won't be in any pain.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.125
We won't let that happen.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.286
Will we, son?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.642
Hello?

07:29.074 --> 07:30.826
Whoa.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.994
You think murderers knock?

07:36.373 --> 07:38.751
Sorry.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.510
What do you want?

07:40.669 --> 07:41.761
Some ammunition.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.887
What kind?

07:43.046 --> 07:45.344
Uh, hunting rifle.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.474
Caliber?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.055
Thirty-aught-six.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.720
Oh, old school.

07:49.886 --> 07:50.978
Yes, I'm...

07:51.137 --> 07:53.356
something of a classicist.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.150
Very limited options in
the thirty-aught-six. Mm.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.110
What are you planning to shoot?

08:01.272 --> 08:02.148
Bean

08:02.315 --> 08:04.067
I've got some 180 grain left.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.326
Mm.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.908
I'm partial to 165 grain.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.618
Nope.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.033
Don't stock it.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.792
Sold out?

08:12.951 --> 08:14.077
Long time ago.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.416
Who bought it?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.501
Maybe I can go beg a few rounds.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.008
Who bought it?

08:20.166 --> 08:22.464
You're asking me
who bought the ammunition?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.129
Yeah.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.423
On the off-chance.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.093
Where I come from, we don't talk
to policemen lightly.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.682
Northern Ireland.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.018
I'm from Fortitude.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.567
Right.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.281
<i>Under Norwegian law,
Liam will not be prosecuted.</i>

08:46.443 --> 08:49.822
<i>But... given the seriousness
of the offense,</i>

08:49.988 --> 08:51.240
the authorities
have ruled

08:51.406 --> 08:53.374
that psychological
assessment take place.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.787
We're the ones being
assessed, aren't we?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.081
<i>Jules and I?</i>

08:59.247 --> 09:01.466
<i>The whole family has
to be assessed together</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:04.423
<i>to determine what caused
Liam's behavior.</i>

09:06.212 --> 09:08.590
I'll need your passports.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.139
Frank.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.935
Frank, come here now.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.702
Okay.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.251
It's magnificent.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.669
Killed another bear.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.339
A full grown adult male.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.348
And ate it.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.938
Sorry, I didn't think
that would work. I was...

10:46.104 --> 10:47.731
Ah!
Fucker.

11:00.952 --> 11:04.081
<i>Taking a slice
from the frontal cortex.</i>

11:04.247 --> 11:09.219
<i>The gyral pattern
is normally formed.</i>

11:09.377 --> 11:13.177
<i>Normal corticomedullary
distinction.</i>

11:13.339 --> 11:18.812
<i>This sample will be
number two.</i>

11:18.970 --> 11:21.189
<i>There is no evidence
of discoloration</i>

11:21.347 --> 11:23.770
<i>or historical trauma.</i>

11:23.933 --> 11:26.607
<i>No generalized atrophy.</i>

11:49.626 --> 11:52.846
<i>I want to know what's
going to happen to Carrie</i>

11:53.004 --> 11:56.554
if they can't find her father.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.974
Well...

12:00.136 --> 12:02.138
she doesn't have any
other family in town,

12:02.305 --> 12:06.310
so I'm looking at other families
who might take her in.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.149
No.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.188
I'll look after her.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.902
You'd do that?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.362
She's ten.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.197
She needs to be in her house,

12:15.360 --> 12:16.953
she needs to sleep
in her own bed.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.705
She can't stay here alone,

12:19.864 --> 12:21.707
so I'll stay with her.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.119
I'll look after her.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.504
I think that would be good.

<i>Hi.</i>

15:09.909 --> 15:11.331
I-I brought
something for Liam.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.168
Did he come home?

15:19.127 --> 15:20.754
Hello.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.764
Your old mum here told me

15:23.923 --> 15:25.721
you liked the photographs
I take.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.808
I was going to bring you one,
but then I had a better idea.

15:29.971 --> 15:35.694
Now, this little fellow here
has great power.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.571
He's a tupilaq.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.982
Hey,

15:44.402 --> 15:46.655
Hey?

16:03.504 --> 16:05.381
Oh, my God.

16:17.185 --> 16:21.440
I think there's something very
bad going on in this place. I...

16:21.606 --> 16:25.110
I'm going to leave here,
and you should, too.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.323
Leave?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.784
Good-bye.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.827
Good-bye.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.460
Henry?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.502
I'll tell Liam about you.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.921
Thank you.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.520
Thank you.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.160
Oh. Hello, Governor.
No. No.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.946
Don't get up. Please.
Your food will get cold.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.958
You know,

17:15.117 --> 17:19.041
the day I arrived in the
taxi, the driver said,

17:19.204 --> 17:21.082
"You see all that snow
out there?

17:21.249 --> 17:24.594
"The icicles,
the reindeer?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.972
"Don't let that mislead you.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.428
This is not Christmas."

17:33.469 --> 17:34.971
Well.

17:35.137 --> 17:39.517
Maybe when all this is over,
you can come back?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.231
When the Glacier Hotel
is finished,

17:41.394 --> 17:44.898
you can spend a long,
quiet night up on the glacier.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.658
Maybe.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.779
May I?

17:51.946 --> 17:54.199
Of course.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.004
Oh.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.421
Sorry. I have to...

18:09.213 --> 18:11.466
<i>Professor Stoddart</i>

18:11.632 --> 18:13.805
hired me to look
at the effects of pollution

18:13.968 --> 18:16.221
and environmental toxins
in apex predators.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.771
Polar bears.
Yes.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.152
We're seeing
aberrant behavior,

18:23.311 --> 18:25.814
cannibalism,
psychotic behavior.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.608
W-What are you proposing?

18:28.774 --> 18:30.993
The tests
I carried out on the bear--

18:31.152 --> 18:33.325
I want to do the same
with Shirley Allerdyce.

18:33.487 --> 18:37.458
This bear attacked and devoured
another adult male bear.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.871
We don't see that happen.
It's psychotic.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.505
Now, Shirley Allerdyce...

18:42.663 --> 18:43.915
I know this sounds strange,

18:44.081 --> 18:45.799
but Shirley Allerdyce
was an apex predator.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.710
What?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.504
Well, scientifically-speaking,
we all are.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.422
We're at the top
of the food chain.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.387
And Shirley attacked and
attempted to kill her mother.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.302
Bio magnification.
The toxins

18:56.469 --> 18:57.891
accumulate
in the apex predators.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.477
Okay, a seal
absorbs a gram of mercury.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.688
So, the bear eats 100 seals.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.523
That's 100 grams of mercury

19:04.685 --> 19:06.312
accumulating
in the bear's liver.

19:06.479 --> 19:12.031
So, you want
to examine Shirley's brain?

19:12.193 --> 19:14.662
Because if we find
what we're looking for,

19:14.820 --> 19:17.744
then that means this
place is dangerous.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.284
The environment.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.703
It's not safe to live here

19:21.869 --> 19:24.543
for any animal.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.437
Carrie?

19:47.603 --> 19:49.776
You want to help?

19:54.318 --> 19:56.286
Cool.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.415
Fork,

19:59.573 --> 20:03.294
knife, spoon,

20:03.452 --> 20:04.829
dessert spoon.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.121
Now you.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.667
Fork on the left.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.087
Spoon, knife...

20:14.505 --> 20:17.054
What is it?

20:17.216 --> 20:20.140
Shirley stabbed her mom
with a fork.

20:21.512 --> 20:24.061
Why did she do that?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.902
We don't know why.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.070
Nobody knows.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.077
I saw Shirley
in the supermarket

20:37.236 --> 20:39.079
next to the fridge.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.081
She was...

20:41.240 --> 20:43.208
She was dead.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.586
And it frightened you?

20:45.745 --> 20:47.998
Yes.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.007
Okay, Carrie.

20:50.166 --> 20:54.797
Okay, I'm going to make sure
that you and me are safe, okay?

20:54.962 --> 20:56.760
I am going
to protect you.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.469
You understand?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.930
Okay.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.234
What has he done?

21:13.397 --> 21:15.820
I just want him
to come home.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.495
You're gonna tell
me what happened

22:01.654 --> 22:03.907
the night Stoddart
was murdered.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.247
You're gonna tell me how you
got my son into his house,

22:07.409 --> 22:11.164
and how you got my son's
fingernail inside a dead man.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.582
How can you think...?

22:12.748 --> 22:14.091
I never went near...

22:14.250 --> 22:17.174
Shirley Allerdyce
attacked her own mother.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.930
That was you. You messed
with that poor girl's mind,

22:20.089 --> 22:22.308
and her breakdown
was your doing.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.345
What Shirley and I had together
was consensual and...

22:25.511 --> 22:27.980
There's no point in
you talking to me...

22:28.138 --> 22:29.936
...completely mutual. ...unless you're
gonna tell me what it is I want to know.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.818
And it's not anybody's place
to tell me otherwise.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.945
I will not listen to bullshit.

22:38.023 --> 22:42.403
This comes off...

22:42.570 --> 22:45.915
when you're ready to
tell me the truth.

24:26.256 --> 24:29.260
We never found the arm.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.645
Yeah, there wasn't
much left of him,

24:31.804 --> 24:34.432
was there?
Hungry bear.

24:34.598 --> 24:38.819
You said he was screaming
when you shot him, right?

24:38.978 --> 24:43.324
Mm. There was enough
left of him for that.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.201
What is it you're looking for?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.907
Satisfying answers

24:51.073 --> 24:53.496
to outstanding questions.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.208
What questions?

24:58.747 --> 25:01.091
Well... it was

25:01.250 --> 25:04.629
minus 17 degrees with a
wind chill of a further

25:04.795 --> 25:08.425
ten degrees when Bill Pettigrew
walked out of town.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.433
And he was a
trained geologist

25:10.592 --> 25:13.266
with years of
field experience.

25:13.429 --> 25:16.308
I would like to
know how he walked

25:16.473 --> 25:19.101
seven miles in his shirtsleeves

25:19.268 --> 25:20.815
and didn't freeze to death.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.572
I'd like to know

25:23.731 --> 25:26.575
why he didn't
take his gun.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.702
And I'd like to know
why the floorboards

25:28.861 --> 25:31.740
in his room were changed.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.704
You'll have to accept that...

25:38.871 --> 25:42.125
there are some things
we'll never understand.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.840
You confessed to me

25:45.002 --> 25:47.630
that you shot him
while he was being torn apart.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.595
Yes.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.518
With what caliber rifle?

26:03.604 --> 26:06.073
All the police-issue
rifles are the same caliber.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.569
Yes.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.612

41:19.477 --> 41:20.694
What?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.822
By confirmation bias.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.780
What's-what's that?

41:25.942 --> 41:27.785
It's where you look for results
to suit your theory

41:27.944 --> 41:29.787
because your self-esteem
has become more important

41:29.946 --> 41:32.540
than a scientific truth.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.326
Okay, we won't know

41:34.492 --> 41:37.041
until we do the procedure
on the child.

41:37.203 --> 41:38.876
Thank you. Don't thank me.
It's the truth.

41:39.038 --> 41:40.164
I was being ironic.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.958
You mean sarcastic.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.968
All right. Enough.

41:46.129 --> 41:48.552
Everything I do
from now on

41:48.715 --> 41:52.060
is breakage and loss.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.562
Less of you left.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.895
Listen...

41:59.559 --> 42:01.106
Listen...

42:01.269 --> 42:03.613
You pulled
my son's fingernail...

42:03.771 --> 42:05.023
No.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.283
...to leave as evidence. Wait.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.069
Like this.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.327
Wait!

42:17.326 --> 42:19.954
<i>I will speak</i>

42:20.121 --> 42:22.249
to the boy's parents,
and if they give consent,

42:22.415 --> 42:23.632
you'll go ahead.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.045
No.

43:01.204 --> 43:02.706
Frank, if you do this,

43:02.872 --> 43:04.920
there's no way back.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.302
Help yourself
and tell me the truth.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.679
Frank.

43:09.837 --> 43:12.090
I'll give you something.
I'll tell the police.

43:14.675 --> 43:15.927
You have something
to tell?

43:18.763 --> 43:20.606
Yeah.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.608
Then tell me.

43:25.978 --> 43:27.480
Tell me!

43:30.733 --> 43:32.781
Frank.

43:38.533 --> 43:39.500
Tell me!

43:44.163 --> 43:46.586
No. Stop it. Tell me!

43:49.335 --> 43:50.382
Tell me!

43:50.545 --> 43:51.717
Stop it!

43:51.879 --> 43:54.052
Tell me! Stop it! Frank!

43:54.215 --> 43:55.637
Oh, my God.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.302
If we don't get the truth,

43:57.468 --> 43:58.890
they'll take Liam.

43:59.053 --> 44:01.556
Turn it off.

44:08.146 --> 44:10.274
Look at the state you've
got yourself into.

44:16.571 --> 44:20.041
Look at the pair of you.

44:20.199 --> 44:23.544
All this blood
and mess.

44:23.703 --> 44:27.424
All this pain.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.841
We don't want that, do we?

44:38.551 --> 44:40.804
This won't help Liam, will it?

44:40.970 --> 44:42.688
Hey.

44:42.847 --> 44:46.101
He needs you, Frank.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.816
He needs you to be strong.

44:48.978 --> 44:51.401
He needs

44:51.564 --> 44:53.692
to look up to his dad.

44:53.858 --> 44:58.079
And you are
a good dad.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.660
You're a
good man,

45:00.823 --> 45:02.825
Frank.

45:02.992 --> 45:04.619
You'd never hurt Liam,
would you?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.458
Never.

45:06.621 --> 45:09.625
Never hurt
anybody.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.823
Let's go home.

45:43.866 --> 45:46.164
That's it.

46:52.435 --> 46:54.608
Dogs found this glove
outside of town.

46:54.770 --> 46:56.613
Crusted with blood.

46:56.772 --> 46:58.024
Ronnie's?

46:58.190 --> 47:00.989
I need to be sure.

47:02.528 --> 47:05.748
Minus-20 last night.

47:05.906 --> 47:10.628
We're only looking
for a body now.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.712
I should tell her.

47:17.126 --> 47:20.721
Oh, no.

47:23.382 --> 47:24.975
Let me deal with it.

47:25.134 --> 47:26.727
Are you sure?
Yeah.

47:26.886 --> 47:29.639
I will.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.478
Okay.

47:45.404 --> 47:48.032
Pizza's
ready.

47:52.203 --> 47:54.456
Come on. It's just pizza.

47:54.622 --> 47:57.171
It's not gonna bite you.

48:17.144 --> 48:19.442

48:28.239 --> 48:30.537
How would something
like this spread?

48:30.699 --> 48:33.043
Uh, blood, saliva,
a sneeze, a cough.

48:33.202 --> 48:36.206
<i>Could a virus cause
this psychotic behavior?</i>

48:36.372 --> 48:37.715
