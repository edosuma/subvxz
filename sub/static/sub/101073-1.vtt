WEBVTT

01:57.682 --> 02:00.586
Open the door.

02:19.471 --> 02:21.407
They tell me
you won't have visitors.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.809
Not even your own father.

02:23.908 --> 02:24.977
Why did you ask for me?

02:26.377 --> 02:27.880
Could you get this to her?

02:36.587 --> 02:38.458
They're throwing
the book at her, you know.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.827
Her lawyer may
try to see you.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.595
Get your help.

02:53.672 --> 02:56.876
I'd sure like to know why
you girls are so goddamn mad.

03:20.499 --> 03:21.567
<i>...fire ricocheted</i>

03:21.600 --> 03:22.634
<i>across the parking lot.</i>

03:22.668 --> 03:24.603
<i>Store clerks recognized
the shooter</i>

03:24.636 --> 03:26.339
<i>as the kidnapped heiress,</i>

03:26.371 --> 03:27.906
<i>whose conversion
to a radical cause</i>

03:27.940 --> 03:29.975
<i>has captivated
the nation this year.</i>

03:30.007 --> 03:34.045
<i>We're coming to you now
live from East Los Angeles,</i>

03:34.079 --> 03:37.350
<i>where local and federal law
enforcement have surrounded</i>

03:37.382 --> 03:40.585
<i>what is thought to be
a safe house of the kidnappers</i>

03:40.619 --> 03:42.555
<i>who call themselves the "PAL."</i>

03:42.587 --> 03:44.924
<i>The People's Army
of Liberation.</i>

03:46.657 --> 03:48.327
That's Los Angeles?

03:49.061 --> 03:51.597
They broke
into <i>Match Game.</i>

03:51.630 --> 03:54.866
I mean, this is happening
right this minute.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.503
It's that Army
of People's Liberation,

03:57.536 --> 03:59.372
or whatever
they call themselves.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.573
Radicals.

04:00.606 --> 04:03.074
And that poor,
brainwashed girl.

04:03.108 --> 04:03.976
"Brainwashed"?

04:04.008 --> 04:07.512
Oh, Iris, read a newspaper
once in a while.

04:07.545 --> 04:11.550
They snatched her from
her own home at gunpoint.

04:12.116 --> 04:13.151
Next thing you know,

04:13.185 --> 04:17.154
they got her running around
with them robbing banks.

04:17.188 --> 04:20.959
Surely, you've heard them on
the radio? Their communiques.

04:20.992 --> 04:24.696
"Mom, Dad,
I'm joining the revolution!"

04:24.729 --> 04:26.532
<i>I'm alive.</i>

04:26.564 --> 04:28.800
God only knows
what they did to her.

04:30.135 --> 04:32.571
How do you know she doesn't
really agree with them?

04:32.604 --> 04:35.574
Do you know
who her grandfather is?

04:35.607 --> 04:36.842
Who her people are?

04:36.874 --> 04:39.644
A girl like that
doesn't really change.

04:40.578 --> 04:43.114
Not a girl from that family.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.018
<i>I'm hearing explosions.</i>

04:46.051 --> 04:49.422
<i>I'm hearing ammunition
in the house blowing up.</i>

04:49.455 --> 04:51.556
<i>What I presume
to be ammunition.</i>

04:51.590 --> 04:54.426
<i>The house is
engulfed in flames.</i>

05:01.032 --> 05:04.102
<i>No one is getting out
of there alive, I'm afraid.</i>

05:04.136 --> 05:08.073
<i>A tragic end
to this very dramatic story.</i>

05:08.105 --> 05:11.810
Oh, I'm going to need
a yellow croquet ball.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.946
And I won't pay
for a whole new set.

05:14.979 --> 05:16.782
I just want the one.

05:16.814 --> 05:19.617
You could go into
the city if you have to.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.987
I understand that
they have everything

05:22.020 --> 05:23.722
down in Chinatown there.

05:30.696 --> 05:32.131
<i>"Dear Michael,</i>

05:33.532 --> 05:34.901
<i>"I love you.</i>

05:36.034 --> 05:37.637
<i>"I miss you.</i>

05:39.571 --> 05:41.674
<i>"It's hard hiding.</i>

05:43.008 --> 05:45.645
<i>"Hiding who I am,
holding my tongue...</i>

05:51.650 --> 05:54.887
<i>"I don't know how much
longer I can stand it.</i>

05:54.919 --> 05:56.989
<i>"I never wanted
to be in this alone.</i>

05:57.922 --> 06:00.492
<i>"I need money or friends.</i>

06:00.525 --> 06:01.828
<i>"I don't have either.</i>

06:04.061 --> 06:05.465
<i>"Please write back."</i>

07:31.883 --> 07:33.185
Iris?

07:34.119 --> 07:35.854
Iris, is that you?

07:35.886 --> 07:37.756
I hope you got lemons.

07:39.191 --> 07:40.092
Ah.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.294
And I see you
picked up my pills. Good.

07:43.328 --> 07:45.664
What about my croquet ball?

07:45.696 --> 07:47.632
You were right,
they have them in Chinatown.

07:47.665 --> 07:49.035
I knew it.

07:49.835 --> 07:51.870
Oh, and, Iris,

07:51.902 --> 07:54.907
somebody came by
today looking for you.

07:56.741 --> 07:59.345
I hope you recall
our agreement

07:59.378 --> 08:00.880
about room and board.

08:01.179 --> 08:02.181
Of course.

08:02.213 --> 08:03.247
No male visitors.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.882
It must be a mistake.

08:04.915 --> 08:07.018
What do you mean a mistake?
How could it be a mistake?

08:07.051 --> 08:09.722
How many
Oriental girls are there

08:09.754 --> 08:12.124
living in Upstate
New York, do you think?

08:13.725 --> 08:15.094
What's the matter with you?

08:35.813 --> 08:37.183
Housekeeping.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.359
I'm not
wearing a wire.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.330
Might be happy
to see a friendly face.

08:52.364 --> 08:55.801
All my friends are in prison.
How'd you find me?

08:55.834 --> 08:58.203
Some of those friends
get letters from you.

08:58.235 --> 09:00.938
I figured you must
have a go-between.

09:00.971 --> 09:01.906
Sharon sold me out?

09:01.940 --> 09:03.876
All she did was
give me a post office box.

09:03.908 --> 09:04.942
And then only after I swore

09:04.975 --> 09:06.177
that I just wanted
to help you.

09:07.278 --> 09:10.015
- I don't need help.
- Why, because you have a plan?

09:15.787 --> 09:16.787
You saw this.

09:16.821 --> 09:19.924
- The safe house is burned.
- Everybody saw it.

09:19.957 --> 09:21.359
Those poor people.

09:24.028 --> 09:25.697
They were good
at getting attention,

09:25.730 --> 09:28.232
but does anyone really know
what they were fighting for?

09:28.266 --> 09:30.269
Couple of those people
weren't in the house.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.772
That girl is alive. Pauline?

09:33.805 --> 09:35.708
Her and a couple
of the others.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.442
I've got them stashed
in a safe house

09:37.475 --> 09:39.412
in the middle
of nowhere up north.

09:40.412 --> 09:42.715
Are you out of your mind?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.249
Those are the most-wanted
people in America.

09:44.282 --> 09:47.018
Exactly.
It's a sensational story.

09:47.051 --> 09:48.854
They're gonna write a book.

09:48.887 --> 09:50.856
And I'm gonna publish it.

09:50.888 --> 09:51.789
They need someone
to take care

09:51.824 --> 09:53.992
of the everyday things
while they write.

09:54.024 --> 09:55.860
So, you know...
Grocery shopping.

09:55.893 --> 09:57.262
Someone who knows how to hide.

09:57.295 --> 09:59.064
You came from them to me?

09:59.096 --> 10:01.100
Come on, you believe
in their principles

10:01.133 --> 10:03.301
even if their tactics
are a little far-out.

10:03.335 --> 10:04.168
They kidnapped her!

10:04.202 --> 10:07.138
Liberated her!
And she calls it that.

10:07.172 --> 10:09.975
Come on.
You're broke, you're alone.

10:10.441 --> 10:12.277
You can't go on like this.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.012
You're lucky it was
me who found you.

10:14.045 --> 10:15.080
You know,
as well as I do,

10:15.113 --> 10:16.215
if the Feds
kick down the door,

10:16.248 --> 10:18.816
they won't bother
to take you alive.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.952
Think of the deal
I could get right now

10:20.985 --> 10:22.754
with what you just told me.

10:22.787 --> 10:23.821
They'd drop all the charges.

10:23.854 --> 10:25.257
I know you'd never
sell anyone out.

10:26.925 --> 10:28.060
Six weeks.

10:29.027 --> 10:31.330
And then anything you want.

10:32.830 --> 10:35.167
Their book could do
what we always wanted.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.743
How much does it pay?

12:15.566 --> 12:17.302
President is going down.

12:18.168 --> 12:19.503
Everyone knows
he's a liar.

12:19.537 --> 12:22.173
Everyone knows
it was a disgraceful war.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.143
A lot of people
hated the war.

12:26.010 --> 12:28.246
They wrote letters,
they marched.

12:28.279 --> 12:30.648
Not everyone
did what I did.

12:30.681 --> 12:32.417
Get yourself
the right lawyers.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.486
The right lawyers
cost money.

12:36.186 --> 12:37.121
Get the book done.

12:37.154 --> 12:39.424
You'll have the best lawyers
money can buy.

13:50.260 --> 13:51.596
Pauline does that.

13:53.764 --> 13:55.234
Keeps her calm.

13:57.101 --> 13:58.502
I'm Jenny.

13:58.536 --> 14:00.406
How long have
you been underground?

14:00.705 --> 14:02.141
Couple years?

14:04.075 --> 14:05.411
I got a lot to learn.

14:07.545 --> 14:10.549
News is the manhunt's
still in California.

14:10.581 --> 14:12.984
You've been spotted in
Alberta, Tijuana,

14:13.018 --> 14:14.418
but nowhere east.

14:14.451 --> 14:15.586
Juan? Baby?

14:15.619 --> 14:18.157
This is Jenny.
Michael Fisher's girlfriend.

14:18.723 --> 14:20.192
Did Frazer
bring cigarettes?

14:32.470 --> 14:33.471
Hey.

14:36.574 --> 14:37.609
I'm Jenny.

14:40.577 --> 14:41.779
You make bombs.

14:41.812 --> 14:43.181
I used to.

14:47.418 --> 14:49.720
Juan says you bombed
an office building.

14:49.753 --> 14:51.489
It was a draft office.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.460
A government target.

14:59.330 --> 15:00.699
It was the middle
of the night.

15:14.479 --> 15:17.681
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with one gun?

15:17.715 --> 15:20.317
This isn't one of
your campus protests, man.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.153
You can't leave
us defenseless.

15:22.186 --> 15:24.422
They murdered our comrades.
This is a war.

15:24.455 --> 15:25.791
There's
a time to rise up,

15:25.824 --> 15:27.359
there's also
a time to lie low.

15:27.392 --> 15:29.294
Folks want
to get behind you.

15:29.326 --> 15:31.196
Your book is
gonna reach them.

15:31.229 --> 15:33.297
And fund your struggle
as a bonus.

15:34.398 --> 15:36.701
He's right.
We need to survive.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.443
- Thanks, man.
- Okay.

15:51.682 --> 15:54.652
I'll take the pickup and
leave the Beetle. It's clean.

15:57.522 --> 16:00.325
I thought maybe
they could dictate the book,

16:00.358 --> 16:02.393
you could,
uh, type it up.

16:15.273 --> 16:16.675
Just get them writing.

16:44.435 --> 16:45.436
You need to eat.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.504
I'm too tired.

16:46.537 --> 16:48.573
I can't sleep
with all the mice.

16:48.907 --> 16:49.775
Eat.

16:49.807 --> 16:51.775
Our brothers and sisters
all over the world

16:51.808 --> 16:54.712
survive on only
one bowl of rice a day.

16:54.745 --> 16:58.350
Yeah, not like the fat pigs
you grew up with,

16:58.383 --> 17:00.152
gorging themselves.

17:03.187 --> 17:04.555
Frazer brought newspapers.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.790
He thought
you might want to read

17:05.821 --> 17:07.391
how they reported
the fire.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.861
We watched it on TV.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.563
Our comrades burned alive

17:12.597 --> 17:14.733
while America sat
eating their TV dinners.

17:15.398 --> 17:16.868
Search and destroy.

17:18.403 --> 17:19.570
That wasn't just
something that happened.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.705
Let me tell you,
that's a fucking policy.

17:25.474 --> 17:28.311
Juan fought alongside
his black brothers in Vietnam.

17:28.346 --> 17:29.615
He saw things.

17:31.416 --> 17:32.850
You could write about that.

17:33.917 --> 17:36.221
About what?

17:36.253 --> 17:38.389
About the war,
how it changed your thinking.

17:43.561 --> 17:45.463
You could write about
how you grew up with so much

17:45.495 --> 17:47.365
and how little you need now.

17:48.498 --> 17:50.635
If you could change,
maybe anyone can.

17:51.502 --> 17:52.637
The newspapers
get it all wrong.

17:52.669 --> 17:55.474
They interviewed your parents
while your comrades burned.

17:56.873 --> 17:59.410
What did they die for?
What did they believe in?

18:18.663 --> 18:19.998
"You were the man
of my dreams..."

18:20.031 --> 18:21.265
It sounds like
a Hallmark card,

18:21.299 --> 18:22.200
"the man of my dreams..."

18:22.234 --> 18:23.901
No, it's romantic.
She falls in love and...

18:24.801 --> 18:26.404
"You were
the man of my dreams."

18:26.436 --> 18:27.673
Juan: Says who?

18:29.307 --> 18:32.678
"Evan, you were
the man of my dreams.

18:34.311 --> 18:37.515
"We both grew up
like birds in a golden cage.

18:38.515 --> 18:40.584
"Afraid that
if we ever escaped,

18:40.618 --> 18:42.686
"we might not survive.

18:42.719 --> 18:45.556
"Like you, I'd always
felt called upon

18:45.590 --> 18:48.592
"to fight the injustice,
the racism.

18:48.626 --> 18:51.296
"Did I feel
more called upon,

18:51.329 --> 18:52.797
"or less able
to answer that call

18:52.830 --> 18:54.899
"because of whose
daughter I was?

18:56.501 --> 18:58.704
"We had so much
to overcome.

19:00.405 --> 19:01.840
"But you changed.

19:03.573 --> 19:05.576
"And you showed me
I could change.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.980
"The poor man
is our brother.

19:09.013 --> 19:12.751
"We are not afraid to pull
your scraps from the trash."

19:26.964 --> 19:28.000
Where are you going?

19:29.333 --> 19:30.501
Hey.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.369
Hey!

19:32.403 --> 19:33.638
What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

19:33.670 --> 19:35.472
We gotta
deliver the eulogy.

19:35.505 --> 19:36.975
Deliver to who?

19:37.007 --> 19:37.808
To the radio station.

19:37.841 --> 19:39.843
We need to get
the word out there.

19:39.877 --> 19:42.313
- Where's the keys?
- Not radio, a book.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.682
I can type it out for you.

19:44.682 --> 19:45.650
A-ha!

19:45.683 --> 19:47.652
You can't drive into
town in broad daylight.

19:47.685 --> 19:49.454
You can't just
mail it, it's basic!

19:49.486 --> 19:50.621
Don't tell
him what to do.

19:50.655 --> 19:51.723
They won't arrest you.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.858
- They will kill you.
- Do you fear death?

19:53.890 --> 19:55.426
- 'Cause I don't.
- Where are you going?

19:55.459 --> 19:56.760
Our deaths will
be righteous.

19:56.793 --> 19:58.396
I'm coming with you.

19:58.428 --> 19:59.563
No,
you can't come with us.

19:59.597 --> 20:02.901
- Yes.
- God damn it, I'll go.

20:04.401 --> 20:05.703
I'll go.

20:09.373 --> 20:10.341
There's a woman
in the Midwest.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.478
She copies out my letters
and mails them on.

20:13.511 --> 20:15.513
If you're caught now,
it's the end of me, too.

20:19.850 --> 20:20.918
Okay.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.704
And get more wine!

20:53.517 --> 20:55.720
- You from Vietnam?
- No.

20:56.087 --> 20:57.955
Huh. Just asking.

20:59.956 --> 21:02.093
Where you from?
Never seen you around.

21:03.494 --> 21:05.397
New York.

21:05.429 --> 21:06.697
My brother went
to Vietnam.

21:07.697 --> 21:08.932
What happened to him?

21:08.965 --> 21:12.169
He was fast,
but the gooks were faster.

21:12.203 --> 21:13.705
You have
a nice day, now.

21:18.609 --> 21:19.811
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I've sent you something.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.979
When you get it,
wear dishwashing gloves.

21:23.214 --> 21:24.148
Mail it to a radio station.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.585
I think it's something
people need to hear.

22:07.625 --> 22:08.827
Shut up.

22:15.632 --> 22:17.168
You really
shouldn't be doing that.

22:18.569 --> 22:19.771
You want a turn?

22:20.605 --> 22:21.873
No.

22:23.573 --> 22:25.609
The Orientals have
exceptional aim.

22:25.642 --> 22:26.777
Great archers.

22:51.601 --> 22:53.170
Brace yourself,
princess.

23:04.014 --> 23:05.716
<i>They're saying
she didn't even recognize</i>

23:05.750 --> 23:06.917
<i>her own mother at first.</i>

23:09.320 --> 23:11.121
They're saying
she was brainwashed.

23:13.090 --> 23:15.193
Seems to me, the main sign
of being brainwashed

23:15.225 --> 23:16.293
is a sincerely-held belief

23:16.327 --> 23:18.063
that you have not
been brainwashed.

23:19.096 --> 23:20.832
Maybe she was afraid.

23:49.260 --> 23:53.898
<i>...prepare to veto
any bill that doesn't fit...</i>

23:53.930 --> 23:56.934
Ego reconstruction
tomorrow at dawn,

23:56.967 --> 23:59.236
then we'll do combat drills
up in the woods.

23:59.270 --> 24:01.272
We don't have enough people
for combat drills...

24:01.304 --> 24:02.974
We play each other,

24:03.006 --> 24:04.275
Yvonne gets you
as a handicap.

24:06.010 --> 24:07.111
Fuck you.

24:07.144 --> 24:08.146
What'd you say?

24:14.284 --> 24:16.653
Jenny could join.

24:16.686 --> 24:18.656
Jenny doesn't want
to do combat drills.

24:18.688 --> 24:19.990
She's a pacifist.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.892
You could
be a real leader.

24:22.959 --> 24:25.128
You've got the chops.
You've got the skin for it.

24:25.161 --> 24:27.264
My skin's got nothing
to do with it.

24:27.298 --> 24:30.368
It's a privilege. Gives you
a Third World perspective.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.803
I'm from California, Juan.

24:36.072 --> 24:37.207
You know what?

24:38.141 --> 24:39.643
You're too humble.

24:39.676 --> 24:41.913
Our leader, he was humble.

24:42.379 --> 24:43.915
He was also a hard-ass.

24:45.683 --> 24:49.153
I don't understand
a pacifist that makes bombs.

24:49.186 --> 24:50.855
No one was ever hurt.

24:52.322 --> 24:53.690
So you were lucky.

24:53.724 --> 24:56.127
It wasn't luck.
We were careful.

24:56.159 --> 24:58.830
Not careful enough.
Your boyfriend went to prison.

25:00.363 --> 25:02.399
She's just jealous.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.202
The princess
is a big step behind,

25:04.234 --> 25:06.937
and she likes to
pretend that she isn't.

25:09.340 --> 25:10.841
Isn't that right?

25:15.212 --> 25:17.849
I said, isn't
that right, princess?

25:20.083 --> 25:21.085
Yeah.

25:33.964 --> 25:36.900
Do you know how
filthy rich that girl was?

25:36.934 --> 25:38.903
Her consciousness
is our responsibility.

25:42.273 --> 25:43.375
What?

25:49.112 --> 25:50.180
Ugh.

25:54.984 --> 25:56.186
- Here, take care of it.
- No, no!

25:56.219 --> 25:58.689
- Juan...
- No, just let her do it.

25:58.723 --> 25:59.758
- Go ahead.
- Stop!

25:59.791 --> 26:01.859
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Stop! Please!

26:02.259 --> 26:03.361
I can't, I can't...

26:03.394 --> 26:04.729
- Go ahead.
- I can't, I can't!

26:04.762 --> 26:06.097
- Come on.
- Juan...

26:09.065 --> 26:11.402
She needs to get
her little, white hands dirty.

26:43.032 --> 26:45.169
I can hear them chewing.

26:46.837 --> 26:48.373
They made a hole.

26:57.247 --> 26:58.982
It's just mice.

27:00.484 --> 27:02.387
Hand me the tape.

27:33.117 --> 27:35.853
Tape it.

27:35.886 --> 27:37.455
Say please, princess.

27:37.487 --> 27:39.157
She's not
your fucking maid.

27:47.965 --> 27:49.234
Thank you.

27:57.975 --> 28:00.278
Hey! Not-from-'Nam.

28:00.311 --> 28:02.013
Got enough wine
to hold you this time?

28:03.080 --> 28:05.515
- What's your name anyway?
- Alice.

28:05.549 --> 28:06.551
Thomas!

28:07.851 --> 28:09.453
I didn't see that.

28:09.485 --> 28:10.955
Don't forget
to punch out.

28:10.987 --> 28:12.222
Already did,
Mr. M.

28:13.623 --> 28:15.325
I'm sorry about your brother.

28:15.892 --> 28:16.927
Why?

28:16.961 --> 28:18.529
He was killed
in a terrible war.

28:18.561 --> 28:20.098
A pointless war.

28:21.532 --> 28:23.234
Don't be mad, Alice,

28:23.266 --> 28:24.869
but I was
just shitting you.

28:24.901 --> 28:26.303
My brother ain't dead.

28:26.337 --> 28:27.405
He was drafted.

28:28.272 --> 28:30.107
Then he ran off
and never came back.

28:30.139 --> 28:32.877
So, it's like he's dead.

28:32.909 --> 28:35.345
My dad did the same thing.
Refused the draft.

28:35.378 --> 28:36.914
But in World War II,

28:36.946 --> 28:38.515
he was angry
that the government

28:38.549 --> 28:40.852
put the Japanese in camps.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.086
Who did?

28:42.119 --> 28:43.288
The government.

28:43.954 --> 28:45.289
After Pearl Harbor.

28:45.321 --> 28:47.090
They didn't teach us
that at school.

28:47.123 --> 28:49.092
How much do they teach
you about slavery?

28:49.126 --> 28:51.162
They didn't
teach us shit about that.

28:51.995 --> 28:53.297
What happened
to your dad?

28:54.298 --> 28:56.200
He went to prison
for a couple of years.

28:56.233 --> 28:59.204
If my dad caught my bro,
he'd wish he was in Vietnam.

29:01.405 --> 29:03.340
- Oh. Is this your old man?
- No.

29:03.373 --> 29:05.542
- What are you doing here?
- Who's this?

29:05.576 --> 29:07.612
Helping me
with groceries.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.414
Hey, man.
How you doin'?

29:10.414 --> 29:12.450
Good. What's
your name, brother?

29:13.449 --> 29:15.552
- Thomas.
- What are you doing, Thomas?

29:17.655 --> 29:19.290
Just saw Alice here and...

29:19.322 --> 29:21.425
It's a good thing I didn't
make my move, right?

29:24.227 --> 29:25.596
Hey, you want
a ride home?

29:43.147 --> 29:44.349
So, Thomas.

29:45.148 --> 29:46.984
You know me?

29:47.016 --> 29:48.452
You've seen me before, yeah?

29:51.155 --> 29:52.490
I don't think so.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.360
All white people
look alike to you?

29:58.494 --> 30:00.130
I don't think so.

30:01.231 --> 30:03.234
You work for
the Man, Thomas?

30:04.234 --> 30:06.037
- Sure.
- No, you see,

30:06.070 --> 30:08.106
you should
work for the People.

30:08.571 --> 30:09.640
Your people.

30:11.041 --> 30:13.210
My people don't
own a grocery store.

30:13.243 --> 30:14.712
Where's your house, Thomas?

30:14.744 --> 30:16.479
Tell you something.

30:16.513 --> 30:20.651
Alice here, she ain't
my old lady, so...

30:22.119 --> 30:24.120
So you still got a chance.

30:29.259 --> 30:31.595
She's my sister-in-arms.

30:31.628 --> 30:33.297
She's been helping me out.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.633
I had a feeling she was
helping out someone.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.269
She was doing some
extensive grocery shopping.

30:40.337 --> 30:42.205
Do you want to
help me out, too?

30:44.073 --> 30:46.377
Sounds serious.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.646
Is there a bank
out by your store?

30:48.678 --> 30:50.046
I guess so.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.581
Mr. Morton makes
the night deposit.

30:51.615 --> 30:54.152
- Mr. Morton's your boss?
- That's my house.

31:08.165 --> 31:09.667
I hope to see
you again, Alice.

31:12.602 --> 31:15.539
- Cigarette, Thomas? You sure?
- No, I'm good, man. Thanks.

31:35.591 --> 31:37.293
You know,
Jenny, the war is over,

31:37.327 --> 31:38.763
but there'll
be more wars.

31:38.795 --> 31:40.330
And with the draft gone,

31:40.363 --> 31:41.498
it'll just be poor kids

31:41.532 --> 31:44.301
like that kid back there
going off to fight.

31:44.333 --> 31:47.604
While the rich kids
stay home getting richer.

31:48.605 --> 31:50.474
Sometimes the only
way things change

31:50.506 --> 31:52.609
is if you force
them to change.

34:00.469 --> 34:01.805
What are you making?

34:02.606 --> 34:03.708
A mousetrap.

34:04.741 --> 34:06.777
I see why you were
good at making bombs.

34:06.810 --> 34:08.344
Cut it out, princess.

34:08.377 --> 34:09.446
It's a compliment.

34:09.478 --> 34:10.781
I said,
cut it out.

34:10.813 --> 34:12.183
Don't talk to her like that.

34:12.215 --> 34:14.951
Don't tell me
how to fucking talk.

34:14.985 --> 34:18.355
You can't just sit around
waiting to die or be caught.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.324
You have to start writing.

34:21.357 --> 34:22.725
Write the book,
get the money.

34:22.759 --> 34:25.196
It's the only way you're
gonna survive underground.

34:25.228 --> 34:26.864
Turn it up.
Turn it up!

34:26.897 --> 34:28.565
<i>...in a Los
Angeles safe house last month.</i>

34:28.598 --> 34:30.333
<i>The poor man
is our brother.</i>

34:30.366 --> 34:33.735
<i>We are not afraid to pull
your scraps from the trash.</i>

34:33.770 --> 34:35.873
<i>Another apparent
survivor of the shootout</i>

34:35.906 --> 34:37.308
<i>issued a violent threat.</i>

34:37.340 --> 34:38.576
<i>After slaughtering
our comrades</i>

34:38.609 --> 34:39.944
<i>in a battle of 100-to-1,</i>

34:39.976 --> 34:41.511
<i>we read that the chief</i>

34:41.545 --> 34:42.947
<i>picked our shotgun shells
from the rubble.</i>

34:42.980 --> 34:44.715
<i>Do you desire a souvenir, pig?</i>

34:44.748 --> 34:46.750
<i>We've got something
better for you.</i>

34:46.782 --> 34:49.353
<i>Vengeance for
our slain comrades.</i>

34:49.386 --> 34:52.322
<i>Blood for blood.
Bullet for bullet.</i>

34:52.355 --> 34:53.924
<i>The search
for the fugitives is...</i>

35:09.473 --> 35:10.507
<i>Hello?</i>

35:10.540 --> 35:11.976
I made a mistake.

35:20.549 --> 35:21.784
Hey.

35:21.817 --> 35:23.319
<i>Don't do this.</i>

35:23.353 --> 35:24.989
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please...

35:25.022 --> 35:27.891
<i>What are you... What are
you doing with those people?</i>

35:27.924 --> 35:30.728
<i>The FBI is talking
to everyone you used to know.</i>

35:30.761 --> 35:32.630
<i>Don't mail me
anything ever again.</i>

35:32.663 --> 35:34.298
<i>I'm not your
go-between anymore.</i>

35:34.331 --> 35:38.302
Please. You're my only link
to Michael. Please, Sharon.

35:38.335 --> 35:41.405
<i>Don't say my fucking name.
Don't ever call me again.</i>

35:45.308 --> 35:47.011
New ideas
in the air around me...

35:47.043 --> 35:48.645
New ideas, real ideas,

35:48.679 --> 35:50.681
and slowly
I began to understand...

35:50.714 --> 35:52.683
...the travesty
of my former life.

35:52.715 --> 35:55.286
I heard a voice
reading the stirring words

35:55.319 --> 35:56.552
of Karl Marx,

35:56.585 --> 35:58.821
Eldridge Cleaver,
George Jackson.

35:58.855 --> 36:02.559
I longed to see the face
of this kind and wise comrade.

36:02.592 --> 36:04.994
I begged him
to take off my blindfold...

36:05.027 --> 36:06.496
No blindfold.

36:06.929 --> 36:08.531
No blindfold?

36:08.565 --> 36:10.301
She falls in love with him
through the words.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.902
We have to know
why she can't see him.

36:11.935 --> 36:14.003
I don't care if she
fell in love with the words

36:14.036 --> 36:15.406
or with his big dick.

36:15.438 --> 36:16.473
No blindfold.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.642
You already said I
couldn't be in the closet.

36:18.674 --> 36:21.878
For the last fucking time,
it was a fucking pantry.

36:22.712 --> 36:23.680
Well,
how would I know?

36:23.714 --> 36:26.016
I had a blindfold on
the whole fucking time.

36:27.784 --> 36:28.786
You did?

36:30.953 --> 36:34.457
On the radio,
you said you let her exercise.

36:34.491 --> 36:35.559
Read the newspaper.
Eat with you.

36:35.592 --> 36:37.860
You said you were honoring
the Geneva Conventions.

36:37.893 --> 36:40.464
She had to be blindfolded
in the beginning

36:40.496 --> 36:41.364
so she couldn't ID us.

36:41.397 --> 36:43.566
That is standard.
It's for her protection.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.868
How long were
you in a closet?

36:44.900 --> 36:45.935
It wasn't a closet!

36:48.839 --> 36:51.607
I don't know what
I thought, but not...

36:51.641 --> 36:53.610
Sister, you can
see for yourself,

36:53.643 --> 36:55.646
Pauline is not
some helpless prisoner.

36:56.645 --> 36:57.814
I'm more committed
than you are.

36:57.848 --> 37:00.650
Hey, don't you dare
talk to Jenny that way.

37:00.683 --> 37:03.386
I would like
to see you do half

37:03.420 --> 37:04.922
of what Jenny has done.

37:05.855 --> 37:06.857
Are you kidding?

37:06.891 --> 37:08.792
The only reason why
you think she's so great,

37:08.824 --> 37:10.627
- is because of her skin.
- You watch your mouth.

37:10.659 --> 37:12.428
Why don't you shut
your fucking trap, princess?

37:12.462 --> 37:13.530
Don't tell me what to do.

37:20.469 --> 37:21.672
Just stay out of it.

38:27.603 --> 38:29.005
Maybe she was afraid.

38:36.011 --> 38:37.780
Oh, she says she was
scared the whole time.

38:37.813 --> 38:40.116
Afraid for her family.
Her sisters.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.518
Says they told her
they'd kill them

38:41.551 --> 38:43.487
if she even imagined
getting rescued.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.656
I meant, afraid of you.

38:47.757 --> 38:49.760
Don't you know
where all this leaves you?

38:56.065 --> 38:57.167
Good morning.

39:01.737 --> 39:03.040
One fucking gun.

39:03.839 --> 39:05.174
What do you do
with one gun?

39:05.208 --> 39:06.877
Anything you want.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.913
You just have to get in
and get out fast.

39:10.045 --> 39:13.750
Twenty hijackings every year,
you never hear about it.

39:13.782 --> 39:16.487
Government doesn't want
you to know how easy it is.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.955
They cover it up.

39:21.056 --> 39:23.159
If we go to Cuba,
we wouldn't have to hide.

39:23.192 --> 39:24.761
We could get a place.

39:24.793 --> 39:25.929
We could write our book.

39:29.965 --> 39:31.801
We could keep
the fight alive.

39:32.134 --> 39:33.803
We'd be alive.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.076
We've been so lucky
this whole time.

39:41.677 --> 39:43.480
How you rode
a desk over in 'Nam.

39:44.714 --> 39:46.282
How we weren't
at the safe house

39:46.315 --> 39:47.850
when the Feds came.

39:47.884 --> 39:49.686
We can't...

39:50.819 --> 39:51.821
Hide.

40:11.174 --> 40:12.710
Sure smells good.

40:13.610 --> 40:14.878
I'm Bob.

40:14.911 --> 40:17.080
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm the owner.

40:17.112 --> 40:20.250
Oh, I'm Jane.
Uh, good morning.

40:20.282 --> 40:21.719
Hi.

40:21.985 --> 40:23.053
Uh...

40:23.085 --> 40:24.788
I thought...

40:24.821 --> 40:28.692
You know, I'm sorry,
I'm pretty lousy with names...

40:28.725 --> 40:30.293
Deirdre was going to be here
with her kids all summer.

40:30.326 --> 40:33.796
Yeah, uh, she took
the kids to her mother...

40:33.830 --> 40:34.965
I thought
I might as well check-in

40:34.998 --> 40:36.199
and see if there's
anything anybody needed.

40:36.232 --> 40:37.833
- If everything's okay.
- No, we're fine.

40:37.866 --> 40:39.736
And I always,
like... I always...

40:41.605 --> 40:42.873
Hello.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.543
I always like
to have a number.

40:50.647 --> 40:51.815
Hey.

40:52.681 --> 40:53.850
Hey.

40:54.851 --> 40:57.921
Wow. Um... Hi, I'm Bob.
Good to meet ya.

40:57.953 --> 40:59.556
- You too.
- Yeah, how're you doin'?

41:02.359 --> 41:03.192
I was just driving upstate

41:03.226 --> 41:05.061
and I thought
I might as well check-in.

41:05.094 --> 41:07.263
My wife and I grew up
in these parts.

41:07.297 --> 41:09.199
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

41:14.069 --> 41:17.073
Well, what do
you say to, uh,

41:17.107 --> 41:18.842
taking a walk
down memory lane?

41:24.313 --> 41:25.147
Yeah, maybe
I'll go and see

41:25.181 --> 41:27.850
if the crick's
runnin' low this year.

41:27.884 --> 41:29.219
Yeah, I'll come
along with you.

41:29.252 --> 41:31.589
Haven't had much
of a chance to explore yet.

41:35.025 --> 41:39.330
You know, I think that, um,
Bob's looking to walk alone.

41:48.304 --> 41:51.407
You are not
paying rent on this place

41:51.440 --> 41:52.842
to have me bother you.

41:52.875 --> 41:55.845
So, you have
a wonderful summer.

41:56.746 --> 41:57.647
You too.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.183
Yeah, take care now.

42:23.739 --> 42:25.408
I'll call
Frazer from town.

42:27.377 --> 42:28.911
Making coffee.

42:28.944 --> 42:30.113
You want some?

42:32.982 --> 42:34.685
Didn't want to
lay our plan on you

42:34.717 --> 42:36.853
until we had it all formed

42:36.886 --> 42:39.223
and it was firm in my mind
how things would go.

42:39.989 --> 42:41.458
We need to carry on the fight,

42:41.491 --> 42:44.393
but we'll need money
to survive.

42:44.427 --> 42:46.930
You've been solid,
so you're in.

42:46.962 --> 42:48.431
- "In"?
- On the plan.

42:50.132 --> 42:52.034
We're going to hit
that kid's store.

42:52.067 --> 42:53.969
Rob his boss
on our way out of town.

42:54.002 --> 42:55.971
Yvonne, does this sound
like a smart idea to you?

42:56.005 --> 42:58.108
His boss makes
the deposit himself.

42:58.141 --> 43:00.310
We'll approach
right when he's closing. Easy.

43:00.342 --> 43:02.178
Are you out of your minds?

43:02.212 --> 43:03.179
We want to make
it up to you

43:03.212 --> 43:05.214
that you'll never get
your cut for the book.

43:05.248 --> 43:06.850
No.

43:06.882 --> 43:08.418
We know that's
why you're here.

43:09.518 --> 43:11.421
You've got to survive
just like we do.

43:12.422 --> 43:13.924
No.

43:15.491 --> 43:18.027
I will not commit
armed robbery, Juan.

43:19.061 --> 43:20.897
Give me
the car keys, Jenny.

43:25.467 --> 43:26.904
You can go.

43:29.038 --> 43:31.175
Or you can stay
and wait for Frazer.

43:32.308 --> 43:33.342
But this...

43:34.911 --> 43:36.113
This is over.

44:18.587 --> 44:20.322
Wait!

44:20.355 --> 44:22.158
- Just let me go, Pauline.
- Jenny!

44:23.458 --> 44:24.828
Wait!

44:24.860 --> 44:26.830
He's not gonna
let you just walk away.

44:26.862 --> 44:28.431
He thinks you're
going to rat us out.

44:29.232 --> 44:30.333
Princess!

44:32.868 --> 44:35.004
He will kill me
if you leave.

44:35.038 --> 44:37.072
Please, Jenny. Please!

44:37.105 --> 44:38.808
Princess, you better
get back in that house

44:38.842 --> 44:40.110
in three seconds.

44:41.511 --> 44:43.413
- One, two...
- Jenny's in.

44:45.081 --> 44:47.518
She'll do it.
She'll hot-wire the car.

44:48.851 --> 44:50.052
Oh, well.

44:51.186 --> 44:53.556
Now, back in the house,
both of you!

45:54.484 --> 45:56.286
Let's go, princess.

45:56.319 --> 45:58.054
You don't
need her, Juan.

45:59.188 --> 46:01.258
You better be here
when we get back.

46:31.487 --> 46:32.522
Let go!

46:35.357 --> 46:37.426
Grab her!
Stop, stop! Stop!

46:49.605 --> 46:51.108
Jesus...

46:51.507 --> 46:52.609
Get her in!

46:52.641 --> 46:54.110
Come on, come on.

46:59.315 --> 47:01.251
Don't leave me, please.

47:06.255 --> 47:08.391
Oh, God,
oh, God. Oh, God.

47:10.726 --> 47:11.962
What happened?

47:11.994 --> 47:13.196
Get in the car.
Let's go...

47:13.228 --> 47:15.464
What happened?

47:15.498 --> 47:17.967
Oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, God, oh, God. Oh, God.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.503
- She's good. She's good. She's good.
- What happened?

47:23.105 --> 47:24.941
- Whose blood is that?
- Go, go, go, go.

47:31.047 --> 47:32.482
Drive, Jenny. Now!

47:32.514 --> 47:34.951
- It's okay.
- Juan, whose blood is that?

47:36.152 --> 47:37.320
Is he dead? Is he dead?

47:37.353 --> 47:39.522
No, no, no.
He's gonna be fine.

47:39.554 --> 47:40.757
He's gonna be fine.

47:40.790 --> 47:42.292
Slow down, slow down.
Don't speed.

47:42.324 --> 47:44.460
Take us back.
Back to the farmhouse.

47:45.161 --> 47:46.463
Just take us back.

47:52.601 --> 47:54.436
Is he dead?

47:54.469 --> 47:57.506
He's okay. He's okay.
He's gonna be okay.

48:26.335 --> 48:27.603
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

48:38.246 --> 48:39.348
You're okay. He is okay.

48:39.382 --> 48:41.717
- He's dead.
- No, no, no. He's not.

48:43.485 --> 48:45.321
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

48:45.353 --> 48:47.122
Pauline,
get in the car.

48:47.156 --> 48:48.558
Get in the car.

48:48.590 --> 48:50.060
Get in the car!

48:50.092 --> 48:51.527
Get in the car.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.562
I can't.
I can't, I can't, I can't.

48:53.596 --> 48:54.598
Get...

49:13.616 --> 49:15.485
Hey!

49:15.518 --> 49:16.520
Hey!

49:17.786 --> 49:18.788
Stop!

49:19.188 --> 49:20.490
Jenny!

49:20.522 --> 49:21.624
Stop!

50:03.431 --> 50:04.868
Did Yvonne
shoot someone?

50:07.770 --> 50:10.739
That kid's boss,
is he dead?

50:17.179 --> 50:18.714
An innocent man...

51:01.357 --> 51:03.393
Wipe down the car.
Wait here for me.

51:47.636 --> 51:49.538
I've called the police.

51:50.873 --> 51:53.309
Well,
I'll be. Iris.

51:53.342 --> 51:55.545
Back to rob me,
are ya?

51:55.578 --> 51:58.380
I suppose you've got your
young man out in the bushes.

51:58.413 --> 51:59.982
I need to buy your car.

52:00.815 --> 52:03.418
I can offer you $200.

52:03.451 --> 52:06.855
It's quarter after 4:00
in the morning.

52:06.889 --> 52:09.759
And my car is worth
much more than that.

52:09.792 --> 52:12.661
You don't drive,
that's why you hired me.

52:12.694 --> 52:15.430
$400, that's
the least I can do.

52:15.464 --> 52:17.600
I bought that car brand-new.

52:17.632 --> 52:20.035
You owe me
three months' wages.

52:20.069 --> 52:23.438
A few weeks' notice
is the norm.

52:23.471 --> 52:25.674
250, and I'll
leave you my car.

52:25.708 --> 52:27.711
You know you need the money.

52:28.944 --> 52:30.580
I said wait!

52:32.480 --> 52:35.584
This is my
friend from New Jersey.

52:37.018 --> 52:38.554
My friend, Ann.

52:39.755 --> 52:41.357
Iris...

52:41.389 --> 52:43.792
I never took you
for an outlaw.

52:46.728 --> 52:49.564
$300. Cash.

52:49.598 --> 52:52.668
And I'll consider it
a favor to you.

54:20.054 --> 54:22.759
My parents will help us.

54:22.792 --> 54:25.895
I'll drive you to California,
but I don't want their help.

54:33.701 --> 54:36.004
Did you ever
send your father a sign?

54:39.141 --> 54:40.810
No.

54:40.842 --> 54:43.145
I haven't spoken
to him in years.

54:44.846 --> 54:47.015
Even before
I went underground,

54:47.049 --> 54:48.150
he thinks I made them write

54:48.183 --> 54:51.186
that we aren't loyal
to our country,

54:51.219 --> 54:52.654
to this country.

55:35.197 --> 55:38.935
Did Juan ever explain
ego reconstruction to you?

55:40.668 --> 55:42.672
It's a game or something.

55:46.741 --> 55:48.677
It's a trust exercise.

55:49.578 --> 55:51.047
The way
that it works is you...

55:53.147 --> 55:54.850
You say "time,"

55:54.884 --> 55:57.753
and then the other person
has one minute

55:57.786 --> 55:59.188
to say anything
they like.

56:01.790 --> 56:03.960
Like lifting up
a lid to your mind.

56:05.293 --> 56:07.230
A minute can
last a long time.

56:10.565 --> 56:12.801
Okay. You could
just say one thing.

56:14.770 --> 56:16.239
Okay. I'll go first.

56:21.243 --> 56:23.145
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

56:23.978 --> 56:25.080
Time.

56:25.114 --> 56:28.284
I wish you'd say one thing,
as long as it's true.

56:29.951 --> 56:30.953
That's it?

56:31.554 --> 56:32.689
Yes, it is.

56:33.621 --> 56:34.924
Okay, time.

56:39.228 --> 56:41.697
After I'd been
with the cadre for a while,

56:43.965 --> 56:45.835
our leader posed
the question,

56:45.868 --> 56:47.904
whether or not
I should join them.

56:49.705 --> 56:51.674
<i>Juan and Yvonne voted no.</i>

56:55.810 --> 56:58.280
Juan said that I would
never fight to the death,

56:59.714 --> 57:01.283
and Yvonne said
if I was ever caught,

57:01.317 --> 57:03.619
I would probably
rat them all out.

57:03.652 --> 57:05.755
<i>Mom. Dad.</i>

57:05.788 --> 57:07.223
<i>You should know
I'm being treated</i>

57:07.255 --> 57:10.225
<i>in accordance
with the Geneva Convention,</i>

57:10.259 --> 57:13.862
<i>because these people believe
I'm a prisoner of war.</i>

57:13.895 --> 57:16.131
<i>A war you might
not think you're fighting,</i>

57:16.165 --> 57:18.734
<i>Dad, but you are.</i>

57:18.766 --> 57:21.270
<i>I know you don't like
to think about it.</i>

57:21.302 --> 57:25.674
<i>The whole system depends
on you not thinking about it.</i>

57:25.708 --> 57:27.744
<i>I have been given a choice.</i>

57:29.777 --> 57:33.782
<i>The choice of being
set free in a safe area,</i>

57:34.850 --> 57:39.288
<i>or of joining forces
with the cadre to fight.</i>

57:39.321 --> 57:40.855
<i>But I've realized something.</i>

57:40.889 --> 57:42.058
That's right.

57:42.090 --> 57:43.993
<i>You can't be
given freedom.</i>

57:44.826 --> 57:46.295
<i>You have to fight for it.</i>

57:47.630 --> 57:51.734
<i>I have chosen
to stay and fight.</i>

57:51.766 --> 57:54.337
Our leader divided us up
into groups of three.

57:55.404 --> 57:58.007
He put me with
Juan and Yvonne.

57:58.040 --> 58:00.275
And then he sent us
out on this mission.

58:00.308 --> 58:04.046
Not a real mission,
it was like a supply run.

58:05.913 --> 58:08.216
But I think, really,
it was like a test.

58:13.822 --> 58:15.657
Juan said that
if I ever ran away,

58:15.690 --> 58:18.026
he'd go personally
to kill my sisters.

58:38.947 --> 58:40.016
What the hell
are you doing?

58:40.049 --> 58:42.251
Get off me!

58:44.018 --> 58:47.022
Get off him!
Get off him! Fucking pig!

58:50.324 --> 58:52.261
Get off!
Let him go!

58:53.962 --> 58:57.800
I need some backup here!
I need some backup now!

59:04.973 --> 59:06.141
Come on, baby.

59:12.413 --> 59:14.116
That's where we were
when the FBI was

59:14.148 --> 59:16.051
surrounding
the safe house.

59:20.221 --> 59:22.891
<i>All the police and the FBI...</i>

59:23.726 --> 59:25.795
<i>There were no negotiations.</i>

59:33.000 --> 59:35.437
And when the ammo in the
house started to blow...

59:37.873 --> 59:38.874
...they just let it burn.

59:47.782 --> 59:50.085
I wasn't inside
the safe house.

59:53.455 --> 59:55.324
But the police
thought I was.

59:57.993 --> 01:00:00.096
And they let them
all burn alive.

01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:22.985
Do you think
it's safe driving in this?

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.356
Maybe we should find a place
to stop for the night.

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:02.291
You lied to me.

01:01:04.226 --> 01:01:07.396
Back at the farmhouse.
You lied.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:11.499
Juan never
would have killed you.

01:01:11.532 --> 01:01:12.969
Or me.

01:01:17.005 --> 01:01:18.107
I could have
just walked away.

01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:20.176
Why didn't you
just let me go?

01:01:25.514 --> 01:01:27.183
You needed a ride.

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.186
You would have
said anything.

01:01:40.194 --> 01:01:41.997
Damn it.

01:01:42.563 --> 01:01:44.065
Shit.

01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:47.235
Damn it!

01:01:49.337 --> 01:01:50.406
Pauline!

01:01:52.373 --> 01:01:53.442
Pauline!

01:01:54.576 --> 01:01:56.411
- Hey!
- Pauline!

01:02:49.063 --> 01:02:50.199
Pauline!

01:02:51.065 --> 01:02:52.301
You have to hide!

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:55.036
You have to hide!
He radioed the state police!

01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:56.571
You have to hide! Go!

01:02:56.605 --> 01:02:58.974
- They're on their way!
- Now is your chance!

01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:00.676
I'll stay,
it's me they want!

01:03:00.708 --> 01:03:02.243
Just go, Jenny! Go!

01:03:02.277 --> 01:03:04.045
I'll never sell you
out, I promise!

01:03:04.078 --> 01:03:05.480
I'll never
sell you out!

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:11.620
Please, Jenny,
just go! It's over!

01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:39.348
You the girls who caused
all this trouble?

01:03:43.018 --> 01:03:44.186
Yes, sir.

01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:50.326
Heard you need a jump-start.

01:05:47.542 --> 01:05:48.476
I don't want you
to say anything

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:51.312
in response to what
I'm about to tell you.

01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:56.385
She's naming you
as an accessory

01:05:56.418 --> 01:05:58.153
to the murder
of a grocery-store owner

01:05:58.185 --> 01:05:59.687
in Monticello,
New York.

01:06:02.389 --> 01:06:03.658
I don't believe it.

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:06.360
Well, she's her
father's daughter.

01:06:06.393 --> 01:06:08.363
She's realized
the adventure is over.

01:06:10.799 --> 01:06:12.367
She's naming names.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.503
She's naming
everyone she ever met.

01:06:14.735 --> 01:06:15.737
Sandy.

01:06:16.871 --> 01:06:18.074
Tom.

01:06:19.306 --> 01:06:21.642
Some guy
named Rob Frazer.

01:06:21.676 --> 01:06:23.545
Your friends at the farmhouse,
we've got them in custody.

01:06:23.578 --> 01:06:24.780
They're saying
they don't know you,

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:25.815
never even heard of you.

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:30.552
It's funny who
your friends turn out to be.

01:06:33.755 --> 01:06:34.757
You're lying.

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:59.748
<i>♪ Well, I met him on a Sunday</i>

01:06:59.781 --> 01:07:05.353
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:07:05.386 --> 01:07:09.257
<i>♪ And I missed him on Monday</i>

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:14.862
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:18.900
<i>♪ Well, I found him on Tuesday</i>

01:07:18.933 --> 01:07:23.805
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:07:24.672 --> 01:07:28.676
<i>♪ And I dated him Wednesday</i>

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:34.316
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:07:34.348 --> 01:07:37.619
<i>♪ I said, "Bye bye, baby"... ♪</i>

01:07:38.386 --> 01:07:39.721
Pelicans!

01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:43.457
They're beautiful!

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:32.441
There were at least three
of 'em that I interacted with.

01:08:32.473 --> 01:08:33.808
There could have been more.

01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:36.777
And they were just
like hippies, you know.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:37.947
Kind of just hippies.

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:40.113
I don't know
when they left,

01:08:40.148 --> 01:08:41.883
but they paid through
the whole summer.

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:46.822
A house doesn't get wiped
clean like this by accident.

01:08:48.288 --> 01:08:49.991
I've got
a clear partial here.

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:53.629
Right index finger,
middle finger.

01:08:53.661 --> 01:08:55.496
Well, that's
a pretty old mattress.

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:56.430
It could have
been my wife,

01:08:56.464 --> 01:08:57.832
we were trying to
fix it up years ago.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.977
"June 12, 1974."

01:09:15.517 --> 01:09:17.620
Jesus! Would you
look at this?

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.388
Get that to the lab.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:23.459
Do a search on known radicals
on the East Coast.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.294
And Wisconsin.

01:09:25.326 --> 01:09:26.661
The Midwest.

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:28.264
I got
a whole handprint.

01:09:28.929 --> 01:09:30.531
Do the whole
damn country.

01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:56.891
What can I get you?

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.861
I'll take a whiskey.

01:10:00.895 --> 01:10:02.030
Rocks?

01:10:02.062 --> 01:10:04.565
Neat.
Little splash of water.

01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:26.922
Another one, Jimmy.

01:10:28.389 --> 01:10:29.557
Ladies.

01:10:30.991 --> 01:10:32.360
Next one's on me.

01:10:32.393 --> 01:10:33.994
This is our last one.

01:10:34.027 --> 01:10:35.129
Where you girls headed?

01:10:35.163 --> 01:10:36.498
- New York.
- Casper.

01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:38.499
I don't
care for Casper,

01:10:38.532 --> 01:10:40.535
guess I'm
a country boy at heart.

01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:42.036
Now, New York,

01:10:43.137 --> 01:10:44.672
you'd have to bind me and gag me

01:10:44.705 --> 01:10:46.607
and carry me
to get out there.

01:10:48.442 --> 01:10:49.945
I don't even know
how they live in there.

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:51.580
You?

01:10:51.612 --> 01:10:53.816
It's harder if you're
used to wide-open spaces.

01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:55.049
Yes.

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:57.986
We better get going.
Gotta get to Casper tonight.

01:10:58.018 --> 01:11:00.722
Come on, one game of pool
before you go. Let's do it.

01:11:02.156 --> 01:11:03.359
Okay.

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:10.398
Did you go through
Jackson on the interstate?

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.934
No.
We like the back roads.

01:11:12.967 --> 01:11:13.969
It's your break.

01:11:21.575 --> 01:11:23.578
You know what you're doing.

01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:25.848
You hit the white.
That's right.

01:11:31.585 --> 01:11:34.155
It's not bad,
for a girl.

01:11:43.731 --> 01:11:46.735
So what are you?
If you don't mind my asking.

01:11:47.201 --> 01:11:48.803
She's a person.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.610
Crow Indian. No...

01:11:57.178 --> 01:11:58.647
Eskimo.

01:11:58.679 --> 01:12:00.915
She's Californian.

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.551
How come you don't
ask me what I am?

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:03.519
Oh, I know what you are.

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:07.188
You're a girl called Trouble
with a capital T.

01:12:08.222 --> 01:12:09.757
Get us another drink.

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.125
Little splash of water.

01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:12.928
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.043
I don't want
to be an outlaw.

01:12:30.712 --> 01:12:32.614
Outlaws always die
at the end of the story.

01:12:32.646 --> 01:12:34.081
I want to be in a comedy.

01:12:34.115 --> 01:12:36.585
There's always a wedding
at the end of a comedy.

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.486
We have to go.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.022
Aw, don't leave.
It's a waste of whiskey.

01:12:48.896 --> 01:12:51.199
She wouldn't have been using
her own name, I don't think.

01:12:55.703 --> 01:12:56.871
Oh...

01:12:57.672 --> 01:12:59.942
They all look alike to me.

01:13:09.851 --> 01:13:11.687
Mind if I take
a look in there?

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:20.060
It's just an old thing

01:13:20.093 --> 01:13:21.963
I haven't driven in years.

01:13:28.236 --> 01:13:29.938
I know
that's your car.

01:13:30.972 --> 01:13:34.609
It was stolen last
summer in San Diego.

01:13:34.642 --> 01:13:37.713
I've got the police report
around here somewhere.

01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:43.017
And I know
who you gave it to.

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:45.020
I don't know
any of those people.

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.989
You wanna take
another look?

01:13:48.822 --> 01:13:50.057
Never seen her, man.

01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:01.803
Police.

01:14:01.835 --> 01:14:03.672
No!

01:14:03.704 --> 01:14:04.872
No.

01:14:23.156 --> 01:14:25.259
"I think of a monk.

01:14:25.293 --> 01:14:29.164
"A Buddhist monk I saw on the
news who set himself on fire.

01:14:29.196 --> 01:14:32.967
"In protest against the
horror of killing, of war.

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:34.936
"That sight shocked me

01:14:34.968 --> 01:14:37.172
"more than anything
else in my life."

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:41.009
It changed everything.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.722
"I thought I knew
what he was doing.

01:14:53.754 --> 01:14:55.257
"But maybe
I was wrong."

01:14:58.058 --> 01:14:59.093
What?

01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:01.029
You? Wrong?

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:06.167
I thought he
wanted to shock us.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.704
Make us see him.
But what if he meant something else?

01:15:09.736 --> 01:15:11.806
- It's better as a question.
- Police! Freeze!

01:15:12.306 --> 01:15:13.741
Hey, freeze! Freeze!

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.710
Freeze, God damn it,
or I'll blow her head off!

01:15:15.743 --> 01:15:17.111
I got 'em, I got 'em.

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:18.146
Stop!

01:15:18.879 --> 01:15:21.215
- Pauline!
- Jenny!

01:15:21.249 --> 01:15:22.651
Jenny! Don't!

01:15:35.362 --> 01:15:37.031
You think that's
how you change things?

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:39.368
You really think that's how
you change people's minds?

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.072
Why did you come here?

01:16:03.857 --> 01:16:05.127
That's my little girl.

01:16:06.026 --> 01:16:08.862
She keeps running away
from boarding school.

01:16:08.896 --> 01:16:11.366
Says she wants to come
out here and live with me.

01:16:11.398 --> 01:16:12.933
Hates her mom,
hates her stepdad,

01:16:12.967 --> 01:16:15.236
hates the whole
goddamn thing.

01:16:15.268 --> 01:16:17.705
She says this country's
built on Negro bodies

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:18.874
and dead Indians.

01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:22.210
Her whole life
growing up,

01:16:22.243 --> 01:16:24.044
you had the war,
the cities on fire,

01:16:24.078 --> 01:16:26.447
that pimp Manson on TV
right during dinner.

01:16:27.949 --> 01:16:29.718
Never had a president
who didn't lie

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:31.386
every time he opened
his goddamn mouth.

01:16:44.397 --> 01:16:45.400
Please.

01:16:49.035 --> 01:16:51.071
Don't help her lawyer
if he comes around.

01:16:51.105 --> 01:16:53.007
Defense will be she was
always just a prisoner.

01:16:53.039 --> 01:16:55.310
But I think you and I
both know that's not the case.

01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:04.953
It's her they want,
nobody cares about you.

01:17:04.986 --> 01:17:06.154
Frankly, I think
they'd go easy

01:17:06.187 --> 01:17:07.723
if you help them
put her away.

01:17:10.357 --> 01:17:11.359
Take my advice.

01:17:12.259 --> 01:17:13.261
Cut a deal.

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:16.732
Save yourself.

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:54.269
<i>Now, you and
the defendant were together</i>

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:55.969
for approximately
eight months,

01:17:56.003 --> 01:17:57.304
is that correct?

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.909
Yes.

01:18:00.941 --> 01:18:03.043
And you traveled
together across the country

01:18:03.076 --> 01:18:05.347
from New York
to California, correct?

01:18:06.313 --> 01:18:07.915
Yes.

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.852
Now, during
this time, in your opinion,

01:18:10.884 --> 01:18:13.087
was the defendant
malnourished?

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.324
She smoked a great deal
and rarely ate.

01:18:17.157 --> 01:18:18.794
Was she deprived of sleep?

01:18:20.393 --> 01:18:21.396
Yes.

01:18:22.129 --> 01:18:23.898
Was she frightened?

01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:24.965
Objection.

01:18:24.999 --> 01:18:27.535
I'll rephrase.
Do you think she was capable

01:18:27.567 --> 01:18:29.570
of freely
making decisions?

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.240
I think she made
one decision.

01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:34.275
I think she decided
not to die.

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:39.179
Would you say,
in general, in your opinion,

01:18:39.213 --> 01:18:42.450
that the defendant was
a captive during this time?

01:18:54.361 --> 01:18:55.362
I thought...

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:02.270
I thought she was
something else.

01:19:02.303 --> 01:19:06.107
But she was a captive.
She was always a captive.

01:19:15.115 --> 01:19:18.118
<i>She was
found guilty of her crimes.</i>

01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:21.489
<i>And I was, too, of mine.</i>

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:27.128
<i>She went to prison,
and so did I.</i>

01:19:29.597 --> 01:19:33.034
<i>Then she got out, and so did I.</i>

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.397
<i>Later, she got married
to one of her bodyguards.</i>

01:20:11.472 --> 01:20:12.574
<i>And me...</i>

01:20:17.578 --> 01:20:19.580
<i>I watched it on TV.</i>
