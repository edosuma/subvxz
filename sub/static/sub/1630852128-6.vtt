WEBVTT

00:12.595 --> 00:13.722
How do you feel?

00:13.805 --> 00:16.766
I don't know. Of course, like,
I think, after the last couple exercises,

00:16.850 --> 00:19.352
I'm coming into this with a lot of…
I don't wanna say pressure,

00:19.436 --> 00:22.897
but, like, I really wanna make sure
that I'm showcasing the best that I got.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.151
-It's… it's like, uh, two Daniels.
-That's true.

00:26.234 --> 00:29.696
When I see you work in the pastry round,
work the chocolate round, I'm like, "Man…"

00:29.779 --> 00:32.282
Once you click and get those two together,
you're gonna be…

00:32.365 --> 00:34.075
-Gonna be dangerous, dude.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.077
With the last pastry exercise,

00:36.619 --> 00:39.039
having been told in that exercise

00:39.122 --> 00:42.792
that what I created taste-,
flavor-, and texture-wise was good,

00:42.876 --> 00:45.670
I was so relieved, which shows progress.

00:45.754 --> 00:49.591
Which again, if I want to win,
I think as long as I continue that,

00:49.674 --> 00:53.094
there's still a high chance
that I could bring it home.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.805
Now we're really
gonna start to see who's…

00:55.889 --> 00:58.600
who's coming on,
who's, you know, staying the same,

00:58.683 --> 01:01.686
who's kinda sinking,
and, like, we gotta… we gotta impress.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.604
I know.

01:02.687 --> 01:03.938
A lot is on the line.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.066
I'm currently living on the couch.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.985
I could potentially get out
of the 400-square-foot apartment

01:09.069 --> 01:10.278
and potentially live on my own.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.030
My own bed is very exciting.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.449
So, fingers crossed,
and we'll see how it goes.

01:23.958 --> 01:24.959
Oh my God.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.253
-Oh boy.
-Oh my God.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.130
-Oh boy.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.470
-Oh my God.
-That's so pretty.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.430
Yeah. It's so cool.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.732
-It looks like glass. You can look in it.
-That's Isomalt.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.777
That really does almost look
like it's lit up.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.655
I love how much movement there is.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.490
Hey, guys.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.243
-Hello, Chef.
-How are you feeling?

01:58.326 --> 02:00.662
-Good, Chef.
-Amazing, fresh? Right? Right?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.123
So, what you have in front of you

02:03.206 --> 02:06.584
is slightly different
from what I usually present to you.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.672
-It's smaller. It's more pop.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.800
It is more suited
for maybe a kid's birthday?

02:13.883 --> 02:14.801
Huh?

02:14.884 --> 02:18.388
-It's really flying, which is the theme.
-Flying?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.265
-Flying.

02:20.348 --> 02:24.686
I'm gonna expect you
to create a playful small showpiece

02:24.769 --> 02:28.690
that could be suited
for kids' birthday celebration,

02:29.274 --> 02:31.943
and you're gonna have to work
within the theme of flight,

02:32.026 --> 02:34.237
using an unconventional tool.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.198
Something not from the pastry field.

02:37.282 --> 02:41.202
Whether it is the pottery wheel,
the wood lathe, or both of them.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.537
-Oh, great.
-Oh God.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.873
-Let me demo this little bad boy.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.959
First, you need to make
a very solid block of chocolate.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.378
I'm going to center this.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.213
You're gonna secure it. All right.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.214
You don't move.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.885
You're gonna have this,
which is your guide.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.637
I'm gonna put my tool straight on it,

02:59.721 --> 03:03.349
and I'm gonna use
this very flat and sturdy surface

03:03.433 --> 03:05.059
to be able to manipulate better.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.562
If you poke it, the tools will come off,

03:07.645 --> 03:10.899
so you want always
to keep a very strong grip.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.447
To think outside of the box,
sometimes we are limited in our tools,

03:17.530 --> 03:20.241
so I love digging into different fields

03:20.325 --> 03:24.621
and bringing some of those great tools
to my pastry academy.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.456
And you're gonna go slowly.

03:26.539 --> 03:30.376
So, layer after layer, you're going,
and you create your pattern.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.214
Using this machine
is a technique I've seen Chef do.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.675
He always posts it on social media,
you see his pieces done like this.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.677
He goes…
And perfect, amazing.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.596
He makes it look so easy.

03:41.679 --> 03:45.600
And that is why we're always in awe
when he puts something up in front of us.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.353
Don't be scared.
You're gonna have so much fun.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.567
I will be pairing you in teams of two.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.526
Oh…

03:55.610 --> 03:58.655
People from the hinge team
to the flower team.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.950
-Mellisa, you will be teamed with Tyricia.
-Okay.

04:02.533 --> 04:06.788
Mellisa and I haven't worked together.
We're both strong female personalities,

04:06.871 --> 04:08.331
and normally in life,

04:08.414 --> 04:11.459
those don't normally mesh together
too well.

04:11.542 --> 04:12.710
So I'm like, "Okay."

04:13.294 --> 04:16.047
Daniel, you will be teamed with Amanda.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.885
And, Thiago,
you will be teamed with Cedrick.

04:22.262 --> 04:26.391
I remember working with him day one.
He was very timid, very unsure of himself,

04:26.474 --> 04:29.060
and I've seen him change
throughout the exercises,

04:29.143 --> 04:31.062
so me and Cedrick are gonna crush it.

04:31.646 --> 04:35.358
Stephanie, Juan, you won't be involved
with the crafting of the showpiece.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.528
-Are you excited?
-Yes, Chef.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.364
It can be a plane,
it can be many different things.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.490
Anything that can fly.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.743
You are only going to have nine hours
to achieve the whole piece.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.453
-Oh God.
-Uh-oh.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.873
-All right, chefs, you may begin.
-Oh boy.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.377
I'll grab parchment paper,
and we can draw what we're gonna do.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.379
-Wanna talk about what we doing?
-Yeah.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.797
So, what were you thinking?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.049
I don't know, a spaceship,

05:00.133 --> 05:03.428
or maybe a rainbow with a pot of gold?

05:03.511 --> 05:04.345
Oh!

05:04.429 --> 05:06.431
But I have a nephew,
so I would rather do…

05:06.514 --> 05:08.850
-Yeah, spaceship.
-…a boy kind of thing.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.268
Do you have any ideas?

05:10.351 --> 05:12.353
-Um, I like the spaceship.
-Okay.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.981
-Want this sizing?
-How big would our blimp be?

05:15.064 --> 05:16.482
But he is the main star.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.737
That might be a little bit big,
compared to the base.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.197
We went with the blimp idea

05:23.281 --> 05:26.117
because that was,
uh, an easy shape, you know.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.161
that we could accomplish on the lathe.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.913
You need a base for the cloud
or go spheres?

05:30.997 --> 05:34.334
-I'm just gonna go spheres. Yep.
-And build upon it? Great.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.420
I get paired up with Daniel,
and I'm super excited,

05:37.503 --> 05:39.839
because Daniel is super talented,

05:39.922 --> 05:42.216
he's super creative, and he's super fast.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.344
Gonna start spreading
for the anchor and fins.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.514
Nine hours for a showpiece in…

05:48.598 --> 05:52.352
in this environment is daunting.
Chocolate needs time to set.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.978
It's gonna take a little bit to set up.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.856
You're gonna have a lot of shaving
to do on the big picture.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.692
It just needs to set,
and if I can get on there first?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.527
-Yeah.
-Because I set it first too.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.031
I wanna be first to get on the lathe,
so that we get it out of the way.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.366
Just to get ahead of everyone.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.743
-I think we're good now.
-I'm gonna start…

06:08.826 --> 06:11.954
-Clouds?
-Clouds, yeah. I'm gonna go grab those.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.414
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Chef.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.666
-Hello, Chef.
-What you plan on doing?

06:16.417 --> 06:19.962
Um, hot-air balloon was the one
of the flying objects we wanted to use,

06:20.046 --> 06:23.508
and then we thought a rainbow for kids.
Kids love rainbows and colors.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.844
-And it's pretty bold.
-Yeah. Good idea. Love the theme overall.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.722
This could end here, almost like a loop.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.475
-I think it'll be more visually pleasing.
-Mm-hmm. I like that.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.310
-The balloon here.
-Okay.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.604
You can--
Instead of having a straight rainbow,

06:36.687 --> 06:37.939
it can be slightly tilted.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.441
-Yeah.
-So the balloon is exactly in the middle.

06:40.525 --> 06:44.487
Okay. We're also paneling these
in a way where there's some ridges.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.157
So it's a thicker sturdier one,
then real thin laminates on the outside,

06:48.241 --> 06:50.284
kind of cutting in on the rainbow.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.286
And then it'll be easier to airbrush.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.832
You just gave me an idea.
You color the white chocolate,

06:55.915 --> 06:59.585
you do a red one,
an orange one, a yellow one.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.671
-Just panel and laminate on top.
-Adhere?

07:01.754 --> 07:05.049
And then you'll have
a sharp cut of all the colors.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.344
It has to be pretty perfect
to align too, right?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.139
If you want the best effect,
yes, but you will be straighter

07:11.222 --> 07:12.682
and cleaner than airbrush.

07:12.765 --> 07:13.891
Yeah, for sure.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.520
It's kinda my thing.
I love doing kids' birthday cakes

07:17.603 --> 07:18.604
and fun stuff like that.

07:18.729 --> 07:22.024
And I've been doing pretty good on these,
so I wanna keep that momentum going.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.444
You start melting white chocolate
while I do this.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.405
Yeah, I'm not great
at tempering white chocolate, so…

07:27.488 --> 07:30.158
Just start melting it,
and then, uh, I can temper it,

07:30.241 --> 07:31.909
and we can do that part together.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.955
When I talked to my son, you know,
I said, "Daddy might bring home $50,000."

07:36.038 --> 07:37.498
"What would you wanna do with it?"

07:37.582 --> 07:39.584
And first thing he says,
"I wanna open your bakery."

07:40.168 --> 07:42.879
You know, having this extra reward

07:42.962 --> 07:45.548
would go a long way
for making that dream a reality.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.474
Mellisa, Tyricia.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.975
-Yes, Chef?
-What're we doing?

07:56.058 --> 07:59.437
We both have nephews,
so we think to go more on the boy side

07:59.520 --> 08:01.314
of birthday party, so we're thinking…

08:01.397 --> 08:02.732
-The invaders.
-Yes.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.403
So we're gonna do,
like, a cool crater for the base,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.322
and then we're gonna do…

08:09.405 --> 08:12.408
It's gonna be the shape
of the moon, but it's not the moon.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.951
It's gonna be, like…

08:14.035 --> 08:15.995
-The Milky Way?
-Yes.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.706
And then we're gonna have
our little martian spaceship on the top.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.166
Oh, that's very thoughtful.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.211
-I think you will please the little kid.
-Thanks, Chef.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.545
It's interesting,

08:24.629 --> 08:28.925
because all the showpieces
that have gone and done well

08:29.008 --> 08:33.721
have been kinda my brainchild.
This one is 100% my brainchild.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.099
Chocolate is still crystallizing,
so we're doing the base right now.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.435
-Do you wanna start to clean the moons?
-Yep.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.520
For the dust.

08:41.312 --> 08:45.441
The design is great, the idea is flawless,

08:45.525 --> 08:47.610
and it just has to be clean.

08:47.693 --> 08:51.739
And it was a big concern for me
because I have seen her work previously,

08:51.822 --> 08:53.074
and it's not clean.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.159
-Mellisa, is that a moon?
-Hmm?

08:55.243 --> 08:58.704
-It's a banana. Looks like one.
-A banana? In outer space?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.873
She's gonna go over there
and hit you, Thiago.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.251
Because it's really gonna be a Milky Way.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.086
-Ah.
-Oh, nice.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.755
I have clever design, you know?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.133
Oh,
that's such a cute little croissant.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.053
One, two…

09:16.347 --> 09:17.265
three.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.101
Those cutouts
are gonna have to be so precise.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.311
Yeah,
they have to be pretty perfect.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.855
And so, we're doing each individual color

09:24.939 --> 09:27.149
and then stick 'em
next to each other, flush.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.944
-I don't like that.
-That's his suggestion.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.113
I don't like that suggestion,
I'll be honest.

09:32.196 --> 09:35.658
For me, that's not possible to do that,
and to have it clean.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.578
This is one of those times where,
do I listen and try it,

09:38.661 --> 09:41.247
or do I not listen and be called
stubborn again? I don't…

09:41.330 --> 09:42.999
So it's a tough way to choose.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.333
I can make the panels,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.961
but as far as putting on them
flushly and cleanly,

09:47.044 --> 09:49.422
I can tell you for a fact
I am not able to do that.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.883
Okay. Forget this. Let's airbrush it.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.385
We can't, like, waste time.

09:54.468 --> 09:57.430
I need Cedrick to be focused,
I need Cedrick to be on my team,

09:57.513 --> 10:00.850
and if it takes me not listening
to something Chef Amaury said,

10:00.933 --> 10:03.269
then that's what I have to do
to make the showpiece complete.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.354
Otherwise, we wouldn't have a showpiece.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.441
This guy's a block.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.277
You're gonna have to shave a lot
once you get it on there.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.821
And it's a blimp,
so it's not anything intricate.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.281
-Yeah.
-It's a blimp.

10:15.364 --> 10:19.327
I've always been very competitive.
Uh, even the smallest, like, challenges,

10:19.410 --> 10:23.581
I always get very aggressive. More so
because of the pressure I put on myself.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.335
I'm making a blimp, so no worries.
I'm not, like, going all out.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.921
-I mean, you don't…
-No, make whatever you're making…

10:31.005 --> 10:33.799
This is all about, I mean,
first time using it as far as I know, so…

10:33.883 --> 10:34.967
That's me too, so…

10:36.302 --> 10:38.679
Unlike every other facet
that you've seen me work on,

10:38.763 --> 10:41.641
when it comes to showpiece
laminating, um, painting,

10:41.724 --> 10:44.852
airbrushing, sculpting,
I don't have a lathe at home.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.480
This is just something I've never done,
and I was very excited.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.899
-You ready?
-I think so.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.946
-Whoo!

10:56.030 --> 10:56.947
Wait!

10:58.449 --> 11:00.660
Oh! Jesus, my anxiety.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.496
Get a good feeling about it.
Go gentle. Yeah.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.873
You are very well lined up here.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.417
That's why it's not moving so much.
It's just the tape.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.753
But here, that's where you're moving.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.673
Stop!

11:17.176 --> 11:18.010
Oh, great.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.889
-Should I cast one smaller?
-Yeah.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.350
-Do the smaller picture. It's less risky.
-Yes, Chef.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.352
This is such heavy piece, you know?

11:26.435 --> 11:29.313
-Chocolate full is much heavier than wood.
-Yes, Chef.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.901
The piece was too soft,
it popped off. Now that pushed us back.

11:33.984 --> 11:37.780
The fact that it just wasn't working,
that's when I started getting annoyed.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.076
I know it was a rough start,
but I think we're catching up.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.662
We're gonna make it happen.
Failure is not an option.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.499
-See how it looks. Yep.
-We can always go in and like…

11:48.582 --> 11:51.252
You could always trim
where we need, you know what I mean?

11:51.335 --> 11:54.255
-Tyricia, the spot is available.
-Oh. Okay, Chef.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.673
Ooh, your turn!

11:59.427 --> 12:00.886
Yeah!

12:00.970 --> 12:03.556
I'm gonna send you
all the good vibes from here.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.100
I don't know why she picked me
to use the machine.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.395
Is she setting me up
to really mess this piece up,

12:09.478 --> 12:11.021
or, like, what is happening?

12:11.105 --> 12:13.774
-Slime salsa!

12:13.858 --> 12:15.234
-Okay.
-Are you ready?

12:15.317 --> 12:19.113
-Do you want to wear the safety goggles?
-Yeah, I'll wear goggles just in case.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.659
-Keep your hands put nearby.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.454
So all of it is confidence.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.789
-Yeah.
-And you… and you keep steady.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.586
-That's what I want to hear.
-Okay, here we go.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.886
More gentle,
Tyricia, when you go in.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.431
-Are you having fun?
-Yes, Chef.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.563
-He said to angle it like this, right?
-Yeah.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.191
So it's all not, like,
the balloon's all the way up there.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.026
-Yeah, that makes sense.
-Yeah.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.696
Chef Amaury said for us
to change the rainbow shape, which I did.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.408
He told me to angle the rainbow,
which I did.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.662
He told me to change the location
of the hot-air balloon, which I did.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.665
So, three out of four things
I listened to.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.876
I mean, that's not somebody
who's stubborn.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.128
It's very good.
I like it's right…

13:16.796 --> 13:20.007
It's angled enough
to give me a good sensation yet stable.

13:20.090 --> 13:20.925
Stable.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.802
Wish you listened to me
for the color.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.805
You did the same job,
but all black. Now you have to spray it.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.098
-The way I was imagining…
-We were very confused.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.643
-It's… it's the same, but with color.
-Yeah. Okay.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.229
So this would've been red,
yellow, orange, huh?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.398
And then yellow, orange, red, blue.
Like a double rainbow, you know?

13:36.482 --> 13:40.236
And I would've seen the rainbow
here and here and here.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.279
-What's done is done.
-The double rainbow.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.240
-I totally misunderstood.
-Okay. Okay.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.659
-I think it must be on my goggles.
-Yes.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.869
-Because my vision is impaired.
-Yes.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.830
It is in… It's definitely on your goggles.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.833
I like it. I think
you did such a great job!

13:53.916 --> 13:55.459
-Thank you.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.587
Okay. That's kinda the shape
of the balloon.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.256
Very ball-like.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.842
-Well, I'm gonna shape it.
-Oh, heard.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.302
Know what I mean?
So this is just the, like, skeleton of it.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.602
I apologize.
I'm taking much longer than I thought.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.687
It's all right.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.232
The more we can get done on the base,
like, then we can focus on that.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.149
Mm-hmm.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.026
Soon as
you get the machine going…

14:21.110 --> 14:22.278
It's gonna get going.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.697
-You're actually perfectly centered.
-Okay.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.323
You ever watch <i>Dirty Dancing</i>?

14:26.907 --> 14:29.743
-Uh, I know what you're… I know it.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.245
I won't help you that much.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.332
Oh my God.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.212
Help. I need Patrick Swayze
over here.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.009
-Turn it on.
-Yes, Chef.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.600
-You're gonna be good. Enjoy.
-Thank you, Chef.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.106
Chef, does that sound bad?
Is it… Like, the sound?

14:59.189 --> 15:00.900
-It's okay for now.
-Okay.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.987
-I'm, like, stressing out, Chef.
-What's your heart rate?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.990
I'm not checking right now.
I'm gonna keep going at this for now.

15:09.116 --> 15:13.203
-Stay focused. Enjoy the ride.
-Try not to make a fricking mess.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.500
Oh!

15:18.584 --> 15:20.044
Oh, that…

15:21.462 --> 15:22.296
I'm so sorry.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.132
-You wanna fight, dude?
-Not right now.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.136
-It's fun, no?
-Yeah.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.430
-You did a good solid foundation.
-Fun.

15:31.513 --> 15:34.934
And at the end,
you're gonna use the warmth of your hand

15:35.017 --> 15:36.018
and go around.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.437
-Like in the movie you referenced.
-Yes, Chef.

15:38.520 --> 15:43.108
Chefs, you're exactly halfway.
In four and a half hours, this is over.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.277
Trouble.

15:53.077 --> 15:57.665
-What shape is he trying to get?
-I have no idea. Um, a blimp.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.832
Right, but…

15:58.916 --> 16:01.293
I don't know.
And they're gonna put it on there.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.006
I'm a mess today. Oh my God.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.303
-Stop it, stop it!

16:12.262 --> 16:14.765
-You have it.
-I'm gonna stop there.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.101
You have the rough shape.
That's all what matters.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.061
You're all right.

16:19.144 --> 16:23.440
I was not having it. I was losing passion
and losing steam on this piece.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.360
It's in your hair.
I know you're mad.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.445
Yes, I am. Very much.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.912
While I hold it,
you'll build up the modeling mass on it.

16:37.746 --> 16:42.459
I don't know what I'm comfortable with
'cause I've never sprayed a ball.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.254
-Thiago, I don't know what to do.
-You good?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.799
-I don't…
-Dude, I need you to handle this.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.301
If… if I'm distracted from this,
we won't have a rainbow.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.469
All right.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.430
Cedrick likes to be
in his comfort zone.

16:54.513 --> 16:58.058
He likes to do things that he knows
and he's comfortable with. Because…

16:58.142 --> 17:00.352
"I've never done this!
Chef Amaury!"

17:00.436 --> 17:01.729
Chef Amaury!

17:02.896 --> 17:04.189
You are needed!

17:05.315 --> 17:06.942
So instead of striping,

17:07.026 --> 17:10.029
because it's very difficult
on this shape to have perfect stripe…

17:10.112 --> 17:13.157
-Uh-huh.
-…you could do just square.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.575
-Four squares of color.
-Of blue?

17:15.409 --> 17:16.910
-You already have the blue.
-Okay.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.663
Like, I don't understand.
It's too many patterns.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.623
It was a lot. It was too much.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.375
-Cedrick?
-Yes.

17:23.459 --> 17:27.921
I used this as a sample.
It took me literally 30 seconds.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.633
So you'll have a checkered pattern
from the top and from the bottom.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.551
Do you get it now?

17:32.634 --> 17:34.553
I'm sorry, Chef.
My mind can't compute all that.

17:34.636 --> 17:38.098
-I'm gonna do something a bit simpler.
-All right. Up to you.

17:39.266 --> 17:43.228
I have things planned out in my head.
Going in and switching something,

17:43.312 --> 17:46.982
like, mid-creation, you know,
it… it sends my brain into overdrive.

17:47.775 --> 17:48.609
Ah!

17:49.485 --> 17:50.569
It done fell off.

17:50.652 --> 17:53.072
This is a very cosmic green.
What do you think?

17:53.155 --> 17:55.407
-It looks alien green.
-It does, right?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.201
-Without being cartoony? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.506
Tyricia, how you always
end up buffing everything?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.841
I'm good at it. That's why.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.220
It's really hard
to have a strategy in these.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.931
What I had learned on the birdhouse was

18:19.014 --> 18:23.102
that Thiago somehow got credit
for a lot of my work,

18:23.185 --> 18:24.895
and I don't want that to happen again

18:24.978 --> 18:28.482
because I need to make sure
that my scores are staying high.

18:29.024 --> 18:32.277
You know how many professionals
wish they can do something like this?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.904
-As shiny as this?
-No, Chef.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.782
You cannot get
shinier cocoa butter than this.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.162
I really don't want a repeat
of that story. Like, come on.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.997
Chefs, one hour to go.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.083
-One hour, Chef.
-Heard. Thank you.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.337
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
That darn clock. Uh, time's not a turtle.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.553
Okay. So, how are you doing your stripes?

18:57.636 --> 19:00.055
Why don't we just go for it
and try more? Wanna do…

19:00.139 --> 19:01.348
I'm sorry. I'm just…

19:02.224 --> 19:05.477
If you think you can get it done.
We've got a limited amount of time.

19:05.561 --> 19:11.275
What color the blimp was going to be
was a very last, if you will, like…

19:11.358 --> 19:13.694
It… We should've made
that decision earlier on.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.738
-I'm sorry. This is, like, frustrating me.
-Yeah.

19:17.447 --> 19:21.326
These are the last of these exercises.
The last few challenges of this course.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.788
I need to do well to really win.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.582
-Still not center.
-Left or right?

19:26.665 --> 19:29.251
You're way off.
You're to the left. See it?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.797
Chefs,
you have 30 minutes remaining.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.090
Thank you, Chef.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.925
Okay. Let's put it on, huh?

19:39.094 --> 19:41.054
-Don't let go, okay?
-Nope.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.806
Close your eyes, Tyricia.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.726
How are we sticking this on there?

19:45.809 --> 19:48.812
-We're gonna melt a little point in here.
-Heard.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.858
I think we just need to glue,
hold, freeze-spray, paint.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.860
-All right.
-And pray.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.322
-I think that's good.
-Yes. Spray it from the back side.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.202
Sorry.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.620
Quick look at the anchor?

20:04.703 --> 20:06.872
-Five minutes, chefs.
-Yes, Chef.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.585
Two minutes, chefs.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.128
-Yes, Chef.
-Thank you, Chef.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.464
-Could've been cleaner.
-Sorry. I failed you.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.798
No, you're good.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.218
And time is up, chefs.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.136
-Heard.
-Heard.

20:26.975 --> 20:30.312
Chefs, can you please bring
your creations forward?

20:39.988 --> 20:42.366
Daniel, Amanda,
can you please come forward?

20:44.243 --> 20:47.371
-Tell me what you've created today.
-So we've created a blimp.

20:47.454 --> 20:51.917
And we're titling it, "Above the clouds,
but still tied to the sky."

20:52.000 --> 20:52.960
Very deep.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.382
Tell me a little bit
of the difficulty of the craft.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.759
-I think it's obvious I had…

21:00.842 --> 21:02.970
-I had difficulties with the lathe today.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.348
And you challenged yourself
on something quite large, quite big.

21:06.431 --> 21:10.102
However, hope you had fun in the crafting
of it, and you've learned something.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.312
I'll buy one soon,
and my parents will kill me.

21:12.396 --> 21:16.316
This, I really like very much.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.112
I don't know if it's very kid-oriented,
but I like the dynamic.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.030
I like the story you're telling.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.283
-This is what's bothering me.
-Yeah.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.412
Remember,
we said bright, colorful?

21:28.495 --> 21:31.081
Also, what do you think you're missing?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.459
-Shine.
-Shiny element.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.628
It's all one texture.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.088
-You know better, Daniel.
-Mm-hmm.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.798
You know that, on the showpiece,

21:39.881 --> 21:41.800
what's beautiful,
what we can do with chocolate,

21:41.883 --> 21:44.094
it's playing with those contrasts
of texture.

21:44.177 --> 21:48.390
And maybe just the same color
but shiny would've been a different piece.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.018
However, it was a risky move.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.937
You're quite thin
with something quite heavy.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.690
And you forgot to mention
one thing about your piece.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.901
It has an interactive part,
which is the propeller at the end.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.611
-Can you demonstrate?
-Yes, Chef.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.031
-It spins! Aha!

22:05.782 --> 22:08.243
-That, for a kid, is priceless.
-Mmm.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.829
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you, Chef.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.918
The UFO team.

22:18.587 --> 22:21.715
-What are you telling me today?
-Well, we both have nephews.

22:21.798 --> 22:24.843
We wanted to go to space
with our alien spaceship.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.553
-Yes.
-A trip through the galaxy.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.263
-Uh-huh.
-I love this piece.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.557
-It's so clean.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.267
It's risky. It's fun.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.520
Whether it is the Milky Way,
the shadow of a moon,

22:35.604 --> 22:37.606
I don't know,
but I know it's out of space.

22:37.689 --> 22:41.526
One thing I want to point out,
and that's gonna be my only negative,

22:42.277 --> 22:45.322
the base, on the overall, is a bit dark.

22:45.405 --> 22:49.117
I am in the galaxy, I would've loved
to see a moon or something.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.869
So that I see light,

22:50.952 --> 22:54.623
I see the black shape,
and I see the little star of the piece.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.750
This is extremely clean,

22:56.833 --> 22:58.585
yet very difficult to achieve.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.462
The color combination,

23:00.545 --> 23:04.049
everything checks out on my list.
It's good, it's good, it's good.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.009
-Thank you, ladies.
-Thank you, Chef.

23:09.805 --> 23:13.433
Team Hot-Air Balloon.
Can you step forward, please?

23:15.185 --> 23:16.978
You guys did a very good job.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.232
I love those big clouds, you know?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.150
It's very bright and colorful.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.861
Very cartoony and yet elegant.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.447
You get the hot-air balloon shape perfect.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.741
Great position, great balance.

23:29.825 --> 23:33.078
I was frustrated because if you would've
tempered multiple chocolates,

23:33.161 --> 23:35.080
not only you show me
a different technique,

23:35.163 --> 23:36.623
and it would've been clean.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.793
I think you've done the best job
anyone could've done

23:39.876 --> 23:41.878
spraying these the way you did.

23:42.504 --> 23:46.508
But I really wish you would've went with,
like, shiny panels and lamination.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.551
Me too.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.387
I love the blue you got.

23:50.470 --> 23:53.890
I wish the pattern
would've been a little bit more, uh, fun.

23:53.974 --> 23:54.808
Yeah.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.726
The position,
it's like, it's dreamy.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.229
It's like taking off
and flying away to your dream.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.189
For a young kid, it's so fun.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.275
And it was really fun using the machine.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.569
-Yeah, you seemed to have fun.
-That was a blast.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.487
I mean, I was hoping
to reenact the movie scene,

24:07.571 --> 24:09.948
but you never came over,
so I just did it alone.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.368
-Well, next time. Thank you, guys.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.580
-Chef's like, "Whoa, boy."

24:18.373 --> 24:20.208
I just want to point something out.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.628
Making it small,
sometimes it's difficult to be clean.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.173
Because it's thinner, it's more precise.

24:26.256 --> 24:29.759
It's really the cleanest job I've seen
through the whole competition so far.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.222
All across the board,
it's a beautiful job.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.349
So, congratulations on that.

24:37.601 --> 24:41.605
As you know, we only have
two more challenges waiting for us.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.483
-Every win really counts.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.610
The winning team…

24:48.820 --> 24:49.946
Oh Lord.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.492
…is the little space guy.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.287
This one,
the cleanliness, the proportion,

24:57.370 --> 24:59.456
great use of the unconventional tools.

24:59.539 --> 25:00.957
This is an easy win for me.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.793
I'm excited.
I was happy. I was like, "Ah!"

25:03.877 --> 25:06.880
I mean, we won.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.425
So now, for the best student
for this exercise.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.594
The top student

25:13.345 --> 25:14.304
will be Tyricia.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.732
And it doesn't take away anything
from what you did, Mellisa,

25:25.815 --> 25:28.777
because your job is fantastic as well.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.404
-Thank you.
-I know you both worked so hard on it.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.908
I know Mellisa
probably pushed you, Tyricia.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.827
The student who came
and did a little rolling pin

25:37.911 --> 25:43.333
is capable of doing such a beautiful job.
You can be really proud of yourself.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.588
I'm the winner. I'm the winner. Um…

25:49.297 --> 25:51.341
Yeah. I'm the winner. It's crazy.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.807
Good job.
It was beautiful, you know that.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.058
-I told you.
-I know.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.853
I did the majority of the showpiece,
so I thought I had a good shot

26:03.937 --> 26:06.439
of winning that one,
to be really honest. Yeah.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.275
Don't take anything away from Tyricia.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.987
-I told her she owned that machine.
-Yeah.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.490
I feel for Mellisa, though. I know
how much of herself is in that piece.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.575
Yeah.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.582
-It was just a rough day, bro.
-I think you jinxed yourself, though.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.127
I'm not happy
with what I brought to the table today.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.379
We had a lot of struggles
on our side too.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.214
Cedrick was very flustered.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.926
We came up with the game plan.
Out the window in the first five minutes.

26:35.010 --> 26:35.844
Yeah.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.014
I thought we had it,
to be honest with you.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.933
I mean, it sucks, 'cause I know
how much work I did for this challenge,

26:42.017 --> 26:43.810
for this chocolate exercise.

26:43.893 --> 26:47.272
I carried our team
for the most part. It was my vision.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.858
I'm such a crybaby.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.485
Now, let's see if I can hold it back.

26:52.569 --> 26:53.737
We have one more,

26:53.820 --> 26:57.824
and I think everyone for these last two
are gonna give it their all.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.909
Like, literally gonna give it their all.
