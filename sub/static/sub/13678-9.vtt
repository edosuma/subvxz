00:02.295 --> 00:03.755
<i>The lights have
been flickering.</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:06.424
<i>Yeah.
The streetlights too.
Brownout's started.</i>

00:06.549 --> 00:07.842
Mr. Alderson,
you're under arrest.

00:07.926 --> 00:09.010
Grab the computers.

00:09.094 --> 00:11.221
<i>Get the hard drives.
All the USB drives.</i>

00:11.429 --> 00:13.640
I want you to lead
the D.C. op.

00:13.765 --> 00:15.809
<i>You can stay here
and crash on the couch.</i>

00:15.934 --> 00:17.018
Home would be better.

00:17.102 --> 00:18.812
<i>Have you spoken
to the administration?</i>

00:18.937 --> 00:19.979
We're not there yet.

00:20.105 --> 00:22.023
<i>There he is,
Terry Colby, the CTO.</i>

00:22.107 --> 00:23.983
You can't be
offering me a job there.

00:24.109 --> 00:25.610
You're
testifying against them.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.405
But, in business,
grudges aren't really a thing.

00:28.488 --> 00:29.948
You do work at E Corp.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.116
I never said that.

00:31.241 --> 00:32.909
Best-case scenario,
I lose my job

00:32.992 --> 00:34.661
and plea-bargain
down a jail sentence.

00:34.786 --> 00:36.162
I'm backed
into a corner.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.790
I wanted to be
Claudia Kincaid so bad.

00:38.915 --> 00:41.167
Ollie Parker told me
about the CD at Allsafe.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.169
Eventually, someone
will connect the dots,

00:43.294 --> 00:44.421
and it'll catch up to you.

00:44.504 --> 00:46.214
The Dark Army
are just hackers.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.007
I clipped one of
the shooters in the leg.

00:48.133 --> 00:49.634
<i>He turned the gun
on himself.</i>

00:49.759 --> 00:51.177
He erased his history.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.096
<i>Tyrell's
always surprising me
with little gifts.</i>

00:55.682 --> 00:58.309
I have a contact attempting
to trace the phone calls,

00:58.435 --> 00:59.477
but he needs more time.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.354
<i>Mobley and Trenton,
both are AWOL.</i>

01:02.647 --> 01:05.358
<i>In that dream I had,
when I was being drowned,</i>

01:05.608 --> 01:07.444
<i>it was when I
stopped fighting it.</i>

01:07.527 --> 01:09.237
<i>That's when I survived.</i>

01:09.320 --> 01:10.488
Hello, Ollie.

01:14.617 --> 01:17.662
<i>It's a gift.
I wanted to give it
to you before I forgot.</i>

01:18.663 --> 01:20.498
That's my last
advance copy.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.293
It's trending on
Amazon's Movers & Shakers.

01:23.376 --> 01:24.753
It's ahead
of Trump's latest.

01:24.836 --> 01:26.796
Can you believe
that cocksucker

01:26.880 --> 01:28.965
is actually running
this time?

01:29.340 --> 01:32.218
I mean, if I wanted,
the things I have on him

01:32.343 --> 01:33.678
could put me
on his ticket.

01:35.847 --> 01:38.516
Politics is for puppets.

01:39.893 --> 01:42.353
Besides,
if you did run for office,

01:42.479 --> 01:45.356
you'd no longer be
"The Last Honest Man."

01:47.025 --> 01:48.610
Thank you, Terry.

01:48.693 --> 01:52.363
Anyway, I need you
to see our friend,

01:52.489 --> 01:53.740
Winston Campbell,

01:53.865 --> 01:57.243
about this issue tonight.

01:58.036 --> 02:01.498
I understand he still
owes you some favors.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.917
He does.

02:04.209 --> 02:05.376
Um...

02:06.211 --> 02:09.964
But a UN vote allowing China
to annex the Congo?

02:10.048 --> 02:12.759
Winston has
the president's ear.

02:12.884 --> 02:16.346
I get it, but I got
to be honest, Phillip,

02:16.429 --> 02:17.847
it's a little out there.

02:17.931 --> 02:19.641
I know
from reading the <i>Times</i>

02:19.724 --> 02:23.061
that China's got the tip
of its dick in the Congo...

02:24.062 --> 02:25.897
And you want Winston

02:26.064 --> 02:27.565
to tell Obama
to look the other way

02:27.690 --> 02:29.234
while the chinks
fuck it dry. I mean...

02:30.026 --> 02:31.110
I don't know,

02:31.236 --> 02:33.905
to give them
national sovereignty
of another nation?

02:34.906 --> 02:36.449
It's a little out there,

02:36.574 --> 02:37.784
don't you think?

02:37.951 --> 02:40.203
Central Africa's
a shit show.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.247
After climate change,

02:42.413 --> 02:46.084
it'll be a bunch of soon-to-be
corpses raging a civil war.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.378
The Oval Office
could spin this

02:48.461 --> 02:51.047
as a humanitarian
intervention.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.466
Well, all due respect,
it's bullshit.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.845
If he tells the ambassador
to vote "yes" on this,

02:56.928 --> 02:58.805
Obama will be
forever known

02:58.930 --> 03:01.432
as the man who gifted
Africa to China.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.561
No.

03:05.395 --> 03:06.813
That's the fine point.

03:07.272 --> 03:11.818
Obama just needs to tell
his ambassador to abstain.

03:14.445 --> 03:17.282
I, uh...
I don't suppose

03:17.782 --> 03:20.660
you're gonna tell me
what all this has to do

03:20.785 --> 03:21.995
with your ambitions.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.665
Do this for me, Terry,

03:28.918 --> 03:31.462
and I promise I
won't forget your help.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.475
I mean,
the fucking Congo.

03:44.601 --> 03:46.311
You know,
the Congo.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.980
I mean, is there
a pocket of the world

03:49.105 --> 03:51.024
you don't have
your hand in?

03:51.149 --> 03:53.651
You're trading
countries like playing cards.

03:54.652 --> 03:57.030
Isn't that what
history is all about?

03:57.155 --> 04:00.575
Politically,
economically, geographically.

04:00.658 --> 04:04.746
Imaginary lines
being drawn and redrawn,

04:04.829 --> 04:06.998
over and over again?

04:09.626 --> 04:10.793
Yeah.

04:11.169 --> 04:15.048
Uh, Phillip,
I got to know.

04:17.508 --> 04:18.885
What do you do it for?

04:19.010 --> 04:21.137
I mean, all of it?

04:26.017 --> 04:27.352
Honestly?

04:28.561 --> 04:29.729
Yeah.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.198
In my life,
as I was making my way,

04:41.532 --> 04:43.701
I always asked
the question,

04:44.702 --> 04:48.039
am I the most
powerful person in the room?

04:50.667 --> 04:52.752
The answer
needed to be yes.

04:54.212 --> 04:58.049
To this day,
I still ask that question.

04:59.926 --> 05:02.053
And the answer
is still yes.

05:03.054 --> 05:05.556
In every room in
the entire world,

05:07.016 --> 05:09.394
the answer is yes.

05:12.772 --> 05:14.857
With the exception of one.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.236
Or two.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.740
And that drives me.

05:25.785 --> 05:27.912
I intend to leave a legacy,

05:29.747 --> 05:33.334
the standard of which
was set by God

05:33.418 --> 05:38.756
when he created the Earth
and man after his own image.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.597
Anything less is

05:48.599 --> 05:49.934
not worth mentioning.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.334
I'm still against this.

06:57.502 --> 06:58.544
The feds see us with him,

06:58.669 --> 07:01.089
no telling
what conclusion they'll draw.

07:01.172 --> 07:04.217
If you had done the job
you were tasked with,

07:04.342 --> 07:05.551
we wouldn't be here.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.234
He's coming.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.747
Hello, Ollie.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.389
<i>Why isn't she
saying anything?</i>

07:52.390 --> 07:54.892
<i>Is she trying to
get inside my head?</i>

08:02.233 --> 08:04.735
<i>I still feel like
she can hear us.</i>

08:05.236 --> 08:07.780
I feel
like she can see me.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.907
You're not
going anywhere.

08:11.951 --> 08:14.579
I know
you're working
with my husband.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.497
Tell me where he is.

08:17.999 --> 08:21.502
Sorry, I don't know.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.175
You're being honest
this time.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.095
But you're gonna
find him for me.

08:31.596 --> 08:33.514
No one's gonna find him.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.226
I don't think I'll
be able to do that.

08:39.103 --> 08:41.105
Now you're
back to lying.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.941
<i>Should I
tell her the truth?</i>

08:44.108 --> 08:46.652
<i>Should I tell her
that her husband's dead?</i>

08:47.862 --> 08:49.155
You do that,
you'll guarantee

08:49.280 --> 08:51.949
we don't walk
out of here alive.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.164
On my first date
with Tyrell,

08:59.457 --> 09:01.417
I saw this stunning redhead

09:01.500 --> 09:03.794
wearing a pair
of cubic zirconia earrings.

09:06.464 --> 09:07.673
I asked him

09:07.798 --> 09:09.967
what he would do to
get me those earrings.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.846
He told me he would do
whatever was necessary.

09:15.306 --> 09:18.142
I told him
I wanted him
to fuck that woman

09:19.227 --> 09:20.728
and bring me
her earrings.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.069
The next morning,
I woke up to a gift.

09:33.157 --> 09:36.410
These are
the cheapest things I own,

09:36.494 --> 09:37.662
yet they're my favorite.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.833
Tyrell would always
do what was necessary.

09:43.334 --> 09:46.671
And at the end of that,
I would receive a gift.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.340
That's why
I know he's alive.

09:50.675 --> 09:53.010
That's why
he's been calling me.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.432
That's why
he sent me this phone.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.022
Because he's doing
what's necessary.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.859
You talked to him?

10:13.239 --> 10:15.199
He called me last night.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.368
<i>That's impossible.</i>

10:18.286 --> 10:20.496
He wants to let me
know that he's okay.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.206
He has a plan.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.125
He told you that?

10:25.209 --> 10:26.377
No.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.924
We haven't spoken.
He's protecting me.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.885
That's what you do
for your partner.

10:39.432 --> 10:41.225
The calls come up
as unknown.

10:41.559 --> 10:42.643
I've tried to
have him tracked,

10:42.727 --> 10:45.396
but I've been unsuccessful.

10:46.981 --> 10:48.899
Is this something you might
be able to accomplish?

10:51.569 --> 10:54.071
This bitch is
blood simple, Elliot.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.199
She's the wife of the psycho
who strangled that woman,

10:57.283 --> 11:00.995
the same psycho who is
this close to doing
the same to you.

11:01.454 --> 11:03.622
If we're around
when she learns
that Tyrell is dead,

11:03.748 --> 11:05.249
you don't think
she'll have us killed?

11:06.292 --> 11:09.170
<i>He's right.
It's not worth it.</i>

11:14.342 --> 11:15.676
I'm sorry.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.472
Can't help you.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.464
Do you really
want to say no to me?

12:06.477 --> 12:07.812
I mean,
where did he come from?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.230
I found him
gasping on the couch.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.107
And you
brought him here?

12:11.190 --> 12:12.566
I wasn't gonna
fuckin' leave him there.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.985
He was saying your name.
I figured he was
one of your guys.

12:15.069 --> 12:17.822
Vincent. Vincent!

12:21.826 --> 12:22.993
Fuck.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.578
I mean,
what is wrong with him?

12:24.662 --> 12:25.996
The hell am I
supposed to know?

12:27.039 --> 12:28.916
Where are the others?
He was the only one there.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.127
I had to cab it
straight back here.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.336
Who the fuck is this guy?

12:34.004 --> 12:37.007
He was one of the D.C. guys
who did the Capitol Hill job.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.718
We got to get this
guy to a hospital.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.262
No hospitals.

12:42.847 --> 12:43.931
How do we know
he doesn't have

12:44.014 --> 12:46.183
a tracker on him
or a bug?

12:49.854 --> 12:51.063
Jesus.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.609
That looks like
internal bleeding.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.695
This guy's gonna die.

12:58.195 --> 13:01.031
All we got to do is
drop him off at an ER.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.787
He knows my face,

13:07.955 --> 13:09.248
my name.

13:09.457 --> 13:12.251
He's gonna wake up
to a drip of morphine.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.378
I can't risk him talking.

13:14.545 --> 13:15.880
And what?

13:16.547 --> 13:19.383
He knew what he was
getting himself into.

13:19.592 --> 13:21.510
If we don't get
him help right now,

13:21.594 --> 13:22.887
he's gonna die.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.390
How does that not
compute for you?

13:27.057 --> 13:29.727
Our focus is finding
Trenton and Mobley.

13:29.894 --> 13:32.771
Trenton and Mobley
might already be dead!

13:32.938 --> 13:35.900
Jesus, you're
completely fucking losing it!

13:36.901 --> 13:39.945
You wanna act like
you're on top of things,
but you're not.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.323
You're buried way underneath.

13:42.573 --> 13:45.701
You're not a leader.
You're not special.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.204
Yeah, your guys did the hack,
but you fumbled your way

13:48.287 --> 13:49.914
into this
ridiculous freak accident.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.749
That ain't leading!

13:51.916 --> 13:53.584
It's time
to drop the charade

13:53.667 --> 13:55.169
like this was all
part of the plan

13:55.252 --> 13:57.296
and wake the fuck up!

14:03.260 --> 14:06.514
There's no way that you can
justify letting him die.

14:25.491 --> 14:27.284
Where's Agent Yang?

14:28.452 --> 14:31.038
Excuse me?
Agent Yang?

14:31.121 --> 14:32.498
Back there.

14:35.793 --> 14:38.045
Yes, yeah, yeah, that's
correct. It's no court.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.047
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.715
Do we know the ETA on that?

14:41.799 --> 14:43.050
I'm sorry,
conference call.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.218
Can you
believe this house?

14:44.301 --> 14:46.136
Mm, Yup,
sure is real nice.

14:46.220 --> 14:49.098
We should seriously consider
pooling our money together.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.183
It's probably going to
be on the market soon.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.143
So what happened
here exactly?

14:53.227 --> 14:54.270
I was told that it had
something to do

14:54.353 --> 14:55.479
with the D.C. activists.

14:55.563 --> 14:56.647
Teabaggers, yeah.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.274
They were found two
days ago in Maryland.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.401
A car chase ensued.
Ended badly.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.736
One got away,
the rest were
apprehended.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.363
This is where they
were supposed to meet.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.282
Owner's an E Corp lawyer.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.741
Supposed to be on vacation.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.368
Starting to look more like
she's missing.

15:11.245 --> 15:14.707
I'm sorry, hon,
I'm still not entirely sure
why I was called here.

15:14.790 --> 15:15.874
Oh!

15:17.543 --> 15:19.378
That's from
someone three doors down.

15:19.461 --> 15:20.921
He was seen here.

15:21.005 --> 15:23.257
He and another
male were spotted
around 10:00 p.m.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.717
getting into a cab.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.137
The description
matches a person of interest
in your code name case.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.140
Wait, he was here tonight?

15:32.558 --> 15:34.101
Have you found the cab?

15:34.184 --> 15:36.312
If this is really the guy,
why did we burn the house?

15:36.395 --> 15:37.646
How come we didn't put
surveillance on him?

15:37.730 --> 15:38.814
What was
the thought process here?

15:38.897 --> 15:41.692
You know, Director Comey's
taking a more aggressive
strategy on everything

15:41.775 --> 15:45.613
ever since the shit hit
the fan over that video.

15:47.031 --> 15:48.282
Yeah.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.452
I can walk you through
the report if we need to.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.495
Check with Agent Burke, yes.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.926
<i>Is this the future
I was fighting for?</i>

16:12.056 --> 16:13.807
<i>The system is hung,</i>

16:16.352 --> 16:18.020
<i>frozen in limbo.</i>

16:21.357 --> 16:23.233
<i>Did we lose the fight?</i>

16:24.318 --> 16:26.278
<i>Maybe wars aren't
meant to be won.</i>

16:27.071 --> 16:29.657
<i>Maybe they're
meant to be continuous.</i>

16:29.782 --> 16:32.076
<i>Maybe Ray had it
right all along.</i>

16:33.494 --> 16:35.704
These people are certifiable.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.666
You
should be going home,

16:38.749 --> 16:41.126
not working with
these wack jobs.

16:41.794 --> 16:45.255
She's a grieving wife.
She wants to believe
he's alive.

16:49.218 --> 16:51.845
Who do you think's
making those calls?

16:52.096 --> 16:55.182
Her husband's
the most wanted man
in the country.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.102
A ton of people hate her
just by association.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.609
We need to stop
at Micro Center.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.986
We're only making one stop.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.155
Your apartment.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.366
The cops
confiscated everything.

17:12.491 --> 17:14.618
It'll be weeks
before I can get it back.

17:15.119 --> 17:18.872
If you want
this done tonight,
I need hardware.

17:41.395 --> 17:44.606
This is a composite
from Ollie Parker's testimony.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.777
This is a sketch
from a description

17:48.861 --> 17:50.446
a neighbor gave us
just now,

17:50.529 --> 17:51.864
at Susan Jacobs's house.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.575
These are from two
separate witnesses.

17:54.658 --> 17:55.993
This is the same guy.

17:59.705 --> 18:03.500
We have fresh
evidence on this guy.
He's not tainted.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.504
We're gonna put out a BOLO.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.340
If you do that,
the Dark Army
will kill him.

18:10.424 --> 18:11.592
Not this again.

18:11.675 --> 18:15.095
If this sketch
gets on the news,
he's as good as dead.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.306
I'm telling you,
they won't let
one of their own

18:17.389 --> 18:19.767
be known by law
enforcement like that.

18:19.850 --> 18:22.561
As it is now,
they might already know.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.774
We lost Sunil Markesh.
We can't let it happen
with this guy.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.776
Just give me...
Dom?

18:28.859 --> 18:31.487
We're going to
the media for this one.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.614
And we're using this.

18:37.409 --> 18:40.662
Look,
this whole, slow roll

18:40.746 --> 18:42.414
that you and the rest of us
have been working up,

18:42.498 --> 18:43.874
it didn't work.

18:43.999 --> 18:47.085
It's time to embrace
the Bureau's new direction.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.091
Yeah, it's Santiago.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.470
Well, tell him I
need him right away.

18:57.346 --> 18:58.514
Dom,

18:59.932 --> 19:03.018
I have Agent Thomas looking
into cab companies.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.896
He may have found a lead
to where this guy went.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.357
Hook up with him.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.113
<i>A cryptocurrency
regulated by Evil Corp.</i>

19:16.824 --> 19:19.368
<i>The hypocrisy
isn't surprising.</i>

19:20.369 --> 19:23.497
A special Evil Corp discount
if we use their new money.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.998
If you ever
needed a sign
that our work

19:25.082 --> 19:27.459
is not done yet,
this is it.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.851
Even if you
track the call to some
crank yanker down the street,

19:43.934 --> 19:45.310
when you give him the info,
you should...

19:45.394 --> 19:47.604
Place the call far away.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.773
Like another
country far.

19:59.741 --> 20:00.826
<i>The phone.</i>

20:01.285 --> 20:03.453
<i>It's the one Joanna gave me.</i>

20:09.376 --> 20:10.586
Hello?

20:24.516 --> 20:26.768
<i>Tell me
you heard that, too.</i>

20:26.852 --> 20:28.270
<i>It can't be him, can it?</i>

20:30.022 --> 20:32.524
<i>And why is
Mr. Robot suddenly gone?</i>

20:48.832 --> 20:50.542
Keep going.

20:52.711 --> 20:53.795
Elliot?

20:53.879 --> 20:55.797
What does he
have to do with
Stage Two?

20:58.050 --> 20:59.801
I was hoping
you could tell me.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.648
I could've just
dropped him off at the door.
You didn't have to...

21:12.731 --> 21:14.775
I couldn't just leave him.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.070
I needed to be here.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.700
You were right back there.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.663
I'm not special.

21:30.082 --> 21:31.458
It's Elliot.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.837
He's the one with the plan,

21:35.921 --> 21:38.340
the one they're
taking seriously.

21:51.228 --> 21:55.065
<i>You know,
I always thought it was crazy
we got away with this.</i>

21:57.109 --> 21:59.319
I thought there was
something special about me

21:59.403 --> 22:01.279
that made it happen.

22:02.114 --> 22:06.868
<i>But it wasn't me,
Mobley, Trenton, or Romero.</i>

22:07.369 --> 22:08.578
It was him.

22:10.622 --> 22:11.790
It's always been him.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.169
When I was five, our parents
took us to Coney Island.

22:17.921 --> 22:20.841
It was my dad's idea of
an Alderson family outing.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.134
What are you doing?

22:22.259 --> 22:23.468
Making a high-powered antenna.

22:23.635 --> 22:26.805
I need to piggyback
off someone else's Wi-Fi.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.933
I remember looking up
at this roller coaster

22:30.017 --> 22:32.894
thinking it was the highest
thing I had ever seen.

22:40.027 --> 22:43.280
Of course, I wasn't
tall enough to go on it,

22:43.530 --> 22:46.366
<i>so my dad went with Elliot,</i>

22:47.325 --> 22:49.536
and I had to
wait with my mom.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.331
<i>I don't remember exactly
what happened next,</i>

22:53.749 --> 22:56.001
but somehow I got lost.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.463
You know, most kids
get scared shitless

22:59.546 --> 23:01.298
when they're alone,
but I wasn't.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.383
I loved it.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.929
All of a sudden,
I felt

23:08.013 --> 23:10.515
someone grab me around
the waist and pick me up.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.644
It was this old woman.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.023
She was skinny and tall.

23:18.398 --> 23:22.194
She had this smeared,
almost pink lipstick.

23:24.279 --> 23:26.656
She held on to me tight.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.035
<i>I thought about screaming,
but I didn't.</i>

23:31.411 --> 23:32.662
I didn't want to.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.169
<i>And we
went to Nathan's,</i>

23:39.252 --> 23:42.422
<i>and she said
that I could have
whatever I wanted.</i>

23:43.548 --> 23:46.301
My parents never
asked me what I wanted.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.220
<i>Ever.</i>

23:48.595 --> 23:51.765
<i>It was the first time
I ever really felt special.</i>

23:52.516 --> 23:54.768
<i>We started
driving to her house,</i>

23:57.395 --> 23:58.814
and I definitely
remember thinking

23:58.897 --> 24:00.607
that something wasn't right,

24:01.066 --> 24:04.694
<i>but I just looked at
her and her lipstick
and let it happen.</i>

24:05.904 --> 24:09.783
And then we got to her house,
and she showed me my room,

24:09.866 --> 24:13.453
and it had one of those beds
with the curtains around it.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.415
And I did
feel like a princess.

24:18.208 --> 24:22.045
<i>I remember thinking
that this was my new home
and my new life,</i>

24:22.129 --> 24:24.965
and I didn't have to see
my parents ever again.

24:25.382 --> 24:28.844
<i>It was like a wish I had that
all of a sudden came true.</i>

24:28.927 --> 24:31.638
<i>And I went to
sleep just hoping</i>

24:31.721 --> 24:34.349
that this wasn't
all a dream,

24:34.432 --> 24:37.435
and I wasn't
just gonna wake up
in my old bed.

24:38.603 --> 24:42.274
And sure enough,
the next morning,
I was still there.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.901
<i>But then
the police barged in.</i>

24:45.902 --> 24:48.864
And when they took me
downstairs, there were
cops everywhere.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.578
I didn't even get to
see the woman again.

24:57.122 --> 25:02.919
And then they
put me in their car
and took me home.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.090
I still wonder

25:07.174 --> 25:09.301
what my life
would've been like
if I had stayed.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.889
<i>But if I had stayed,</i>

25:18.268 --> 25:20.395
then I wouldn't have Elliot.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.777
There are a lot of
guys working on this.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.613
None of them
could figure it out.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.657
What's that for?

25:32.741 --> 25:35.535
For impersonating
an NYPD officer.

25:35.619 --> 25:38.121
All cell carriers have
a law enforcement hotline.

25:38.205 --> 25:39.706
Instead of hacking
the carrier,

25:39.789 --> 25:41.374
if the situation's
urgent enough,

25:41.750 --> 25:44.127
you can just ask them to track
a blocked call for you.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.658
Is it done?

26:17.577 --> 26:18.662
Not yet.

26:18.828 --> 26:21.164
Need a few minutes
for the spoof fax
to go through.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.167
It needs to propagate
through their system.

26:25.168 --> 26:28.255
No one in the world uses
fax anymore except cops.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.802
Half of me
wants it to be him.

26:34.511 --> 26:36.263
Half of me doesn't.

26:39.474 --> 26:40.725
Before working
for the Wellicks,

26:40.809 --> 26:42.852
I had a list of clients,

26:42.936 --> 26:45.397
all of them eccentric
in one form or another.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.607
I worked for this one guy

26:47.691 --> 26:50.318
who used
to masturbate in the car.

26:50.860 --> 26:53.613
He used to have
me drop him off
at Carnegie Hall.

26:53.697 --> 26:56.574
He was a first
chair violinist.

26:57.701 --> 27:01.204
<i>God,
now he wants to have
a heart-to-heart.</i>

27:03.206 --> 27:05.542
<i>Focusing on you
helps drown him out...</i>

27:05.709 --> 27:08.586
One of those
Stradivarius violins
from the 1700s.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.089
<i>Like talking to someone
in a crowded restaurant.</i>

27:11.214 --> 27:12.299
Take it everywhere with him...

27:12.382 --> 27:15.552
<i>All the other
voices and noises
fade into the background.</i>

27:15.635 --> 27:18.513
<i>Somehow your brain is able
to decode the components</i>

27:18.596 --> 27:20.890
<i>of that complex
auditory space.</i>

27:22.934 --> 27:24.561
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

27:25.228 --> 27:27.605
<i>Good.
That gives us time to talk.</i>

27:29.566 --> 27:32.193
<i>Is Mr. Robot MIA
because he's afraid?</i>

27:33.570 --> 27:37.115
<i>Afraid of what I might find
when I'm done with this hack?</i>

27:37.782 --> 27:40.493
<i>Why did that phone
call freak him out?</i>

27:40.577 --> 27:43.330
<i>Could he have
lied about Tyrell?</i>

27:43.413 --> 27:45.206
<i>What's his move here?</i>

27:45.749 --> 27:48.209
<i>Do you remember
the last thing he wanted?</i>

27:48.293 --> 27:51.004
<i>He kept wanting to come
back home, remember?</i>

27:51.087 --> 27:54.007
<i>There must be
something here that he needs.</i>

27:54.549 --> 27:57.594
<i>He's been bringing it up
since we left prison.</i>

27:58.219 --> 27:59.763
<i>Can you help?</i>

28:01.014 --> 28:02.474
<i>Can you look?</i>

28:03.975 --> 28:05.769
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

28:20.367 --> 28:22.660
<i>And, now, they're
moving to the next step.</i>

28:22.744 --> 28:24.037
<i>Yes, the next step.</i>

28:24.120 --> 28:26.122
<i>You know what
the next step is?
Blackouts. Why?</i>

28:26.247 --> 28:27.957
<i>So they can take
away your power,</i>

28:28.041 --> 28:30.377
<i>and I am not talking
about your electricity.</i>

28:32.295 --> 28:34.547
<i>I'm talking
about your computers,
your access to the Internet,</i>

28:34.631 --> 28:36.633
<i>your television, your phone.</i>

28:36.841 --> 28:39.469
<i>What does that
all add up to?
Information.</i>

28:40.387 --> 28:41.638
Those wounds
aren't fresh.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.807
Do you have any idea
what happened to him?

28:44.307 --> 28:45.517
<i>It puts them in control.</i>
Uh, we...

28:45.642 --> 28:49.020
We went over to his place
and found him like that.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.397
Is he gonna be all right?

28:50.980 --> 28:52.357
He's on a respirator.

28:52.482 --> 28:55.068
They're gonna do a CT scan
and run some other tests.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.903
We should know more in about
an hour or so.

28:56.986 --> 28:58.780
Okay.
Thank you.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.913
Well, we got
an hour to kill.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.499
Hungry?

29:09.791 --> 29:11.167
Yeah.
Yeah.

29:14.337 --> 29:17.257
<i>Hi, this is Detective
Richard Hannigan, NYPD,</i>

29:17.382 --> 29:20.718
Eleventh precinct,
badge number 22350.

29:21.344 --> 29:24.639
I just faxed
over an exigent form
for a suicidal person.

29:24.722 --> 29:26.599
Can you confirm
that you received it?

29:27.308 --> 29:29.227
Yeah, I got a guy who
called his girlfriend's cell

29:29.310 --> 29:31.646
saying he's
gonna shoot himself.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.357
Yeah, all of them
came in blocked.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.986
Perfect, can you see
if it's one of yours?

29:39.237 --> 29:42.323
Can you ping that phone
for a current location?

29:47.495 --> 29:48.997
You've been a huge help.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.499
I'll call you
if there's something else.

30:12.395 --> 30:13.480
Got it.

30:19.777 --> 30:20.904
God damn it.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.659
Is that where
the phone is right now?

30:26.910 --> 30:28.578
Within 12 meters.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.089
Is it him?

30:50.266 --> 30:51.309
Clear.

30:51.434 --> 30:52.602
Clear!

31:04.447 --> 31:06.199
Trust me,

31:06.282 --> 31:08.117
he wouldn't be calling
from that house.

31:37.981 --> 31:41.276
<i>Has issued a BOLO on the man
pictured in this sketch.</i>

31:41.359 --> 31:44.821
<i>Given FBI cyber involvement,
we can only speculate
at this time</i>

31:44.904 --> 31:46.531
<i>that the man in this sketch</i>

31:46.656 --> 31:49.659
<i>may be wanted in relation
to the infamous
Five/Nine attack.</i>

32:07.677 --> 32:10.305
<i>I have money
stashed at a hackerspace
on Canal.</i>

32:10.388 --> 32:12.348
Okay, we make sure
Vincent's all right.

32:12.432 --> 32:14.309
We wipe your place down,
and then we bolt.

32:14.392 --> 32:15.602
We can target them
from afar

32:15.685 --> 32:17.604
for more intel
on Trenton and Mobley.

32:17.687 --> 32:20.773
Darlene, you know
we can't leave.

32:20.857 --> 32:22.775
They don't own us.

32:22.859 --> 32:24.152
We played by their rules,

32:24.235 --> 32:27.363
and those fuckers still hit
Trenton and Mobley.

32:31.367 --> 32:35.663
I am so sick
of always worrying
about switching cabs

32:35.747 --> 32:37.999
and phones and trains
and always looking behind...

32:38.082 --> 32:39.876
Just calm down, okay?

32:41.711 --> 32:43.129
He was waiting here?

32:43.212 --> 32:44.589
Yeah, they were...
They?

32:44.881 --> 32:46.299
Who was he with?
Male or female?

32:46.382 --> 32:48.551
Dom, we're reviewing
the security footage.

32:48.635 --> 32:49.761
Let her finish.

32:49.886 --> 32:51.012
A woman.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.056
His girlfriend, I think.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.599
They were waiting here.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.809
They were really concerned
about their friend.

32:56.893 --> 32:58.436
They waited
for about an hour,

32:58.561 --> 33:01.189
and then I told them we were
sending him up for some tests.

33:01.272 --> 33:02.982
And that's when
they left?

33:03.066 --> 33:05.360
I'm sorry, I wasn't
paying attention.

33:05.443 --> 33:08.112
If it helps, I told them
to come back in an hour.

33:08.237 --> 33:11.616
At this point,
they're definitely
not coming back here.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.285
He probably
saw the BOLO.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.245
He's freaking out.
Probably hiding.

33:16.913 --> 33:18.915
It might take some time,
but we'll get him.

33:46.526 --> 33:48.319
I got your messages.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.113
Sorry it took so long
to get here.

33:58.121 --> 33:59.956
What's wrong?

34:01.708 --> 34:03.835
Why did you
start fsociety?

34:19.809 --> 34:22.562
I didn't want
to involve you.

34:24.731 --> 34:28.067
An FBI agent
came to my place.

34:44.876 --> 34:48.045
Look, let's just sit
here and chill a minute.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.840
Right? We'll come up
with something.

34:50.923 --> 34:55.344
Sometimes
the best decision
is not making one.

34:59.682 --> 35:00.725
Fine.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.780
Why'd it take you so
long to call it in?
The TV's right there.

35:15.865 --> 35:16.949
It's okay.

35:17.033 --> 35:18.075
You didn't do anything wrong.

35:18.201 --> 35:19.952
I'm just trying
to figure something out.

35:21.412 --> 35:24.248
It's probably because
Janice turns it to the news

35:24.373 --> 35:26.083
when her shift starts.

35:31.798 --> 35:33.633
They didn't see it.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.761
The TV.
They're coming back.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.431
They probably
didn't go too far.

35:48.272 --> 35:49.941
I can fix this, okay?

35:50.149 --> 35:52.902
I will fix...
I'm gonna confess.

35:53.110 --> 35:56.906
I've already called my lawyer.
I'm on my way to meet her now.

35:58.741 --> 36:02.036
I can't keep pretending
like this is gonna go away.

36:03.538 --> 36:05.248
We can't beat them.

36:05.623 --> 36:07.416
Trust me, I've tried.

36:08.376 --> 36:11.587
No matter what we do,
we will always lose to them.

36:15.424 --> 36:18.636
I'm gonna tell 'em that
I planted the femtocell.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.893
I would never involve
any of you,

36:25.977 --> 36:27.895
so I'm just gonna
own up for what I did.

36:27.979 --> 36:31.607
But sooner or later, Elliot,
this will all catch up to you.

36:34.569 --> 36:35.945
Thank you.

36:36.279 --> 36:37.321
Ooh.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.575
What the fuck
are you doing?

36:40.658 --> 36:41.701
What?

36:41.784 --> 36:44.120
If you wanted some,
you should've
ordered your own.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.289
You know I'm not into
that family-style shit.

36:46.414 --> 36:47.707
Oh. Oops.

36:52.670 --> 36:54.589
You're such an asshole.

36:55.089 --> 36:57.258
<i>How am I
supposed to help
the ones I care about</i>

36:57.341 --> 37:01.137
<i>when every step I take
puts them in greater danger?</i>

37:01.429 --> 37:03.014
<i>This was my plan,</i>

37:03.431 --> 37:07.018
<i>and I hid in a cage
while everyone else
took all the risk.</i>

37:07.268 --> 37:08.686
I mean, fuck.

37:10.313 --> 37:12.690
We have to talk
to each other
on the subway.

37:13.608 --> 37:15.693
It's a long way
from getting high

37:15.818 --> 37:17.945
and watching
<i>Back to the Future II.</i>

37:23.284 --> 37:26.162
Yeah, we never did
get around to doing that.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.839
Excuse me,
have you seen
a young couple

37:36.964 --> 37:38.841
walk past recently coming
from that direction?

37:38.966 --> 37:40.134
No, I didn't see anyone.

37:40.217 --> 37:43.387
She's got dark hair,
he's wearing
a baseball hat.

37:47.016 --> 37:49.644
<i>Do you remember
when I found you
at the Queens Museum?</i>

37:49.977 --> 37:53.606
You were pacing
and screaming
at the staff,

37:53.689 --> 37:55.983
because they couldn't
see whoever you said
you were seeing.

37:58.152 --> 38:01.322
Was it your dad then too,
or was it someone else?

38:06.911 --> 38:09.163
I don't remember
that at all.

38:10.206 --> 38:13.376
Elliot, I don't know
if you started all of this
because of him.

38:13.501 --> 38:16.087
But whatever he is,
you can't work with him.

38:17.672 --> 38:20.716
Don't trick yourself
into thinking that.

38:27.556 --> 38:29.558
If I was gonna
eat around here,
where would I go?

38:29.684 --> 38:30.685
There's nothing
around here.

38:30.768 --> 38:32.395
You've got to go over,
like, five blocks.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.398
There's still a few
places open over there.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.758
You should probably
get off here.

39:21.819 --> 39:23.821
<i>I don't want
to leave her.</i>

40:51.534 --> 40:54.203
Send all units
to Watts and Sixth Ave.

41:55.598 --> 41:57.850
Get down! Down
on the ground!

41:59.768 --> 42:02.188
Green! Green! FBI!

42:02.438 --> 42:03.856
Don't shoot!
