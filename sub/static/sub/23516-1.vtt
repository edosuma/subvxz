WEBVTT

05:49.390 --> 05:52.268
I am pleased that, at the skilled hands

05:52.351 --> 05:55.313
of a brilliant design engineer
and his staff,

05:55.396 --> 06:00.610
preliminary designs for a German
Volkswagen have been completed,

06:00.693 --> 06:05.073
and the first models will finally be
tested by the middle of the year.

06:07.075 --> 06:12.288
<i>Then you will understand why I was</i>
<i>utterly determined to lay the groundwork</i>

06:12.371 --> 06:19.337
<i>for the invention of the German Volkswagen</i>
<i>and its ultimate conclusion,</i>

06:19.420 --> 06:24.008
<i>and by that, dear gentlemen,</i>
<i>I mean a successful conclusion!</i>

12:12.690 --> 12:17.069
Whenever there is war,
fewer remain in the end.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.865
There are always winners and losers.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.453
And I intend,

12:26.787 --> 12:31.667
along with our VW partners
around the world,

12:33.836 --> 12:35.504
to emerge victorious.

12:43.762 --> 12:46.974
Yeah, a little faster is more fun.

13:10.414 --> 13:14.919
I don't feel
I can't communicate with others.

13:15.002 --> 13:18.464
But there are individuals with whom
I don't want to communicate.

13:18.547 --> 13:22.176
And they complain
about my lack of communication.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.803
However, that's not unintentional.

17:40.309 --> 17:45.314
<i>Dr. Piëch and I have been working together</i>
<i>for almost 30 years.</i>

17:45.397 --> 17:50.069
And as you know, Dr. Piëch has always
regarded innovation as the top priority.

17:50.152 --> 17:56.033
So, we agreed that he would focus
on innovation and I would safeguard it.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.668
We wanted to have
the most satisfied customers.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.171
We wanted to have
the most satisfied employees.

18:09.254 --> 18:13.050
We wanted to achieve good results
in order to invest in the future.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.802
And we wanted to make the best cars.

18:14.885 --> 18:19.348
The upshot of which will be
that by 2018 we are going to be

18:19.431 --> 18:21.767
the preeminent car manufacturer
in the world.

31:32.015 --> 31:37.729
Technological leadership is not just
defined by horsepower and torque anymore.

31:38.938 --> 31:42.734
The joy of economical and emissions-free
driving, ladies and gentlemen,

31:43.318 --> 31:47.447
will be the currency in coming years.

43:12.631 --> 43:17.219
The irregularities found
in our diesel engines

43:17.303 --> 43:20.681
are the antithesis of everything
Volkswagen stands for.

43:21.140 --> 43:26.020
Even I, at this point,
don't have answers to all the questions.

43:26.103 --> 43:30.190
But we are working diligently
to find out exactly what happened.

43:41.201 --> 43:44.455
To our employees, I'd like to say,

43:44.913 --> 43:47.625
I know with how much dedication,

43:47.708 --> 43:52.004
honesty and integrity you pursue your work
day after day.

43:52.921 --> 43:58.594
I am well aware that much of it
has been thrown into question.

43:59.637 --> 44:03.557
But it would be wrong
to cast general suspicion

44:03.641 --> 44:07.561
on the hard and honest work
of 600,000 people

44:07.645 --> 44:09.355
because of the mistake made
by the few.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.618
You have my word,

44:22.701 --> 44:27.790
we will do all of this with the greatest
possible openness and transparency.

51:38.178 --> 51:41.348
<i>Do they poison the air more than allowed?</i>

52:23.890 --> 52:27.769
<i>We did the same test on the street</i>
<i>that we did in the lab.</i>
