it.
>> Then don't rent it and get

was overpriced at $4, let alone

07:17.337 --> 07:20.372

For that much money, i could
have bought an actual pony and

better at cooking.

>> Darwin: [ Muffled ] Yeah, i
chipped a tooth on one of his
cupcakes.

>> Mom: Chicken and fries.
>> Gumball: Hm...
Does this look a little

13:16.696 --> 13:19.330
underdone to you?
>> Darwin: I think there's
something wrong with my fries,

13:19.332 --> 13:20.999

>> Gumball: Can we just skip to
dessert?

We're both very sorry for what
we've done.

>> Mom: So you<i> don't</i> know what
you've done!
>> Both: No!

13:35.549 --> 13:38.817
>> Mom: Then how can you
apologize for something you
don't even know about?!

13:38.819 --> 13:42.353
>> Gumball: I don't know!
>> Anais: Look, dad overheard
what you said in the playground.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.857
>> Gumball: Ohhh! That!
>> Mom: And he's been hiding in
the shed ever since.

can't embarrass us in there.
>> Darwin: Incoming!

>> Gumball: Look, I'd happily
apologize to dad...

13:51.665 --> 13:54.666
If what we said wasn't the
truth!
>> Mom: Right. That's it.

13:54.668 --> 13:58.703
You clearly don't appreciate
your parents, so until you
apologize to your father, we

13:58.705 --> 14:02.407
won't be doing anything else for
you.
Let's see how long you last.

>> Anais: Oh. I'm sorry.

14:16.790 --> 14:20.458
But as mom pays the water bill
and you two are insensitive
brats, i think you'll need to

14:20.460 --> 14:23.027
shower somewhere else.
>> Gumball: [ Mockingly ] As mom
pays the water bill, i think you

14:23.029 --> 14:25.663
should shower somewhere else.
>> Anais: You can say what you
like, but you're not going to

Thank you, clearance aisle.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.691
>> Darwin: Well, you heard what
Larry said.
We got to eat this stuff before

14:53.693 --> 14:56.794
it goes past its expiration
date.
>> Gumball: Oh, young Darwin,

14:56.796 --> 14:59.297
you're so gullible.
Food doesn't have a sell-by
date.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.600
That's just what the
corporations want you to think
so you buy more oil and believe

15:02.602 --> 15:05.203
in moon landings, like the sheep
you are.
Take this banana.

15:05.205 --> 15:09.173
According to your "sell-by
date," it should go bad today,
but as you can see, it's

15:09.175 --> 15:12.911
absolutely fine.

ready now.

apologizing.

I should have known it was
something lame like that.

cake in a junkyard.
Go on. Tell me your plan, then.

that's not going to get it into
college.
