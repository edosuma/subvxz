00:56.056 --> 00:57.766
I'm the new CEO!

I'm the new CEO!

01:01.895 --> 01:04.731
[baby] Bonuses for everyone! Whoo-hoo!

01:04.981 --> 01:07.275
I'm the new CEO!

01:07.734 --> 01:10.195
I'm the new CEO...

01:10.278 --> 01:12.363
What are you people doing in my office?

01:12.447 --> 01:15.492
Frederic Estes kidnapped
Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.410
Yes!

01:18.536 --> 01:21.039
I mean, obviously,
I'm also worried about her safety,

01:21.122 --> 01:22.999
but don't you see the opportunity here?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.125
Not really.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.879
Leadership.
Every new CEO has to make a big splash,

01:27.962 --> 01:30.089
seize the loyalty of his team.

01:30.173 --> 01:33.301
What better way than a high-stakes
rescue operation?

01:33.384 --> 01:35.386
[laughs]

01:35.470 --> 01:36.679
What's this other one?

01:36.930 --> 01:37.847
Nothing. It's just--

01:37.931 --> 01:40.600
"To my baby brother." In your handwriting?

01:40.683 --> 01:43.478
A congratulations note.
Templeton, I'm blushing.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.063
Don't read it right now. It's for--

01:45.897 --> 01:50.276
-You're quitting?
-No!

01:50.360 --> 01:52.403
I told you, like, 20 minutes ago.

01:52.487 --> 01:56.908
I already forgot!

01:58.618 --> 02:01.079
-Why?
-It's all in the letter, okay?

02:01.162 --> 02:04.040
But forget that for now.
We have to rescue Turtleneck.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.709
After that,
you can read what I wrote and-- Hey!

02:06.876 --> 02:08.545
Resignation not accepted.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.839
But I double-checked my spelling
and everything.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.008
This is it, Templeton!
We're finally in charge.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.511
This is where the real fun starts.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.306
Did you know this company has a fleet
of fully-loaded baby assault vehicles?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.016
-I didn't.
-You do now!

02:22.517 --> 02:24.978
-Staci, put in a requisition.
-On it.

02:25.061 --> 02:29.274
-Jimbo, show me your war face.
-[shrieking]

02:29.357 --> 02:31.776
Let's rain down baby fury.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.363
-I'm still quitting after this.
-[chuckles] Sure you are.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.575
Now, how do we locate
a rotten syndicate of old people?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.326
-With an old person--
-No!

02:40.410 --> 02:42.245
[Templeton] Gigi!

02:42.537 --> 02:45.582
[grunts] Templeton,
I'm Baby Corp's new CEO!

02:45.665 --> 02:47.959
I can't go running for help
to our elderly enemies!

02:48.167 --> 02:49.878
Gigi's our grandma.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.838
And she'll know
where we can find Frederic.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.883
[sighs] Just get the info.
Don't tell me where it comes from.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.386
-It will be from Gigi! Oof!
-Ga-ga, goo-goo, cannot hear you.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.638
-[Gigi] Tim!
-She's been turned! Take her out!

03:00.763 --> 03:02.682
I'm so sorry!

03:02.765 --> 03:04.684
I didn't realize you were there!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.354
[giggling]

03:08.688 --> 03:12.191
-How did the baby--?
-Wait. You're leaving today?

03:12.275 --> 03:13.943
It's the End O' Summer.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.653
Heading back home
right after the festival.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.989
-But--
-[Boss coughing, mumbling]

03:18.907 --> 03:20.241
Speaking of talking,

03:20.325 --> 03:23.202
do you know where Frederic Estes is,
for no reason you should ask about?

03:23.286 --> 03:26.372
Well, sure. He's at the festival
like everyone else.

03:26.456 --> 03:30.376
He and his senior friends
even put together their own fun house.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.045
Ha! What a hoot!

03:32.462 --> 03:33.713
[door opens]

03:33.880 --> 03:35.632
That has to be where
they're holding Turtleneck.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.927
Your mom and dad are off rehearsing
for the big festival finale,

03:39.010 --> 03:40.929
so I thought the rest of us
could go together.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.513
-One last--
-Going ahead.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.057
You catch up! Love you! Bye!

03:45.183 --> 03:46.017
[bell dinging]

03:48.937 --> 03:51.022
[gasps] I need backup!

03:51.105 --> 03:52.148
Whoa! [thuds]

03:53.233 --> 03:57.111
There it is: One big fat mousetrap.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.989
-[grunts] What?
-You're killing me, man-baby.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.407
Don't look straight in the camera.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.451
Why is Hendershot filming us?

04:03.534 --> 04:06.621
Leadership, Templeton.
I clawed my way to the top.

04:06.704 --> 04:10.083
Now I show Baby Corp
what a real CEO looks like.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.835
[Hendershot] And... put some mustard
on it this time.

04:13.294 --> 04:18.633
Estes' fun house.
It's one big fat mousetrap.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.802
But Baby Corp is a tiger,

04:20.885 --> 04:24.013
and you can't catch a tiger
in a mousetrap.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.683
-Great line!
-Great CEO!

04:26.766 --> 04:29.352
He says I'm a tiger! [roars]

04:29.435 --> 04:30.687
Ow! Quit it!

04:30.895 --> 04:34.232
-Ready to have your baby minds blown?
-[baby] Yeah!

04:34.315 --> 04:38.278
-How come he gets to look at the camera?
-Because I'm the boss, baby.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.530
-[baby] Whoo-hoo!
-Roll in the heavy forces!

04:41.072 --> 04:42.073
[tires screeching]

04:43.992 --> 04:46.077
[giggles, sighs]

04:49.372 --> 04:50.206
[engine revs]

04:50.748 --> 04:54.085
Aw! How cute! They have baby rides!

04:54.752 --> 04:59.173
Go get them, Staci! Yee-haw!
I've never said "yee-haw" before.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.092
I love the new CEO me!

05:02.051 --> 05:03.469
[Staci cackles]

05:03.553 --> 05:07.682
Clear the geezers! Infantry, fire!

05:09.642 --> 05:11.019
[explosions]

05:11.436 --> 05:14.188
-It's half-off coupons!
-For what?

05:14.272 --> 05:16.024
It doesn't matter!

05:17.233 --> 05:18.067
Boom, baby.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.193
[cheering]

05:22.322 --> 05:23.156
This is great!

05:26.784 --> 05:29.454
[Boss] Baby steps.
And watch your diapered backsides.

05:29.537 --> 05:32.790
Never trust any place
that mixes old people and fun.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.459
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[gasps]

05:35.418 --> 05:36.419

05:37.211 --> 05:39.255
[screams] I'm an old fogey!

05:39.338 --> 05:41.632
What have they done to my baby face?

05:41.716 --> 05:43.342

-[camera shutters clicking]
-[screams]

05:46.763 --> 05:48.431
I'm gonna die one day,

05:48.514 --> 05:51.726

I've got to live!

05:51.851 --> 05:52.769
[cries]

05:52.935 --> 05:55.229
Shield your eyes
from the sagging decrepitude!

05:55.313 --> 05:56.439
Keep moving!

05:57.231 --> 05:58.733
Whoa! [gasps]

06:02.945 --> 06:06.741
You wanted to show everybody
what a great leader you are. Well...

06:07.241 --> 06:08.367
Good call, Templeton.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.828
CEO says you go first!

06:12.538 --> 06:14.957
[screaming, barking]

06:15.291 --> 06:17.043
I meant you should go.

06:17.126 --> 06:20.004
Then what's the point of being in charge?
Ugh, fine.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.464
Leadership pose!

06:21.547 --> 06:23.007
Oh, fart, poop, doodie!

06:23.174 --> 06:24.675
[all screaming]

06:24.759 --> 06:25.593
[both] No!

06:25.676 --> 06:27.804
It just sliced through my shoe,
you babies!

06:40.108 --> 06:41.651
[man's voice]  Get off my lawn!

06:41.734 --> 06:44.320
How is this a  fun  house? Ow!

06:44.403 --> 06:47.406
Get off my lawn! Get off my lawn!

06:47.490 --> 06:49.992
-Get off my lawn!
-Dodge like you're being audited!

06:50.076 --> 06:52.495
-[all gasp]
-Right behind you, boss!

06:52.745 --> 06:54.622
[screams, grunts]

06:55.456 --> 06:57.083
I made boom-boom.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.961
[man's voice]  Get off my lawn!
Get off my lawn!

-[baby screams]
-[both gasp]

07:01.129 --> 07:04.423
[Boss] Keep moving!
Your new CEO has everything under control!

07:05.049 --> 07:07.093
-Get off my lawn!
-Boss, we got two exits!

07:07.176 --> 07:10.388
Staci, Jimbo, peel right.
Templeton, Katja, we go left.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.390
Hendershot! How's my voice? Too yelly?

07:12.598 --> 07:15.685
You're focused on the ears
when you should be focused on the heart.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.978
-Get off my lawn!
-Incoming!

07:17.061 --> 07:19.564

07:25.945 --> 07:26.988
[laughs]

07:27.071 --> 07:32.326
Jim Dandy! Did I just bag two CEOs
for the price of one?

07:32.618 --> 07:34.495
And I know just the ransom.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.914
We're not paying you one Buffalo nickel.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.626
No, you're gonna shut down Baby Corp.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.421
-[all gasping]
-We're taking back the world's love.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.007
Old people are the new babies.

07:46.090 --> 07:50.887
[cooing, babbling]

07:51.053 --> 07:53.848
That's disgusting, and you need to fire
your marketing department.

07:53.931 --> 07:54.849
Googah Kai!

07:55.308 --> 07:56.684
Yah!

07:56.767 --> 07:58.269
-Googah Kai!
-Googah Kai!

07:58.352 --> 08:00.062
I don't know any baby karate!

08:00.146 --> 08:01.772
Then use what you do know!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.734
[yells, grunts]

08:05.860 --> 08:07.653
[screams, grunts]

08:09.864 --> 08:13.618

but I think we're winning!

08:13.701 --> 08:15.328
[both] Yay!

08:15.536 --> 08:18.498
Jimbo, Staci! Where are you?
It's the final fight!

08:18.581 --> 08:22.293
-Got stuck in a mirror maze, sir.
-I'll ask this baby for directions.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.377

08:23.461 --> 08:24.629
It was me again!

-Save me a shin kick.
-No promises. [gasps]

08:28.299 --> 08:29.675
Peekaboo!

08:41.062 --> 08:43.314
-Googah Kai!
-Whoa! [grunts]

08:44.690 --> 08:48.110
I just did what I know.
Still quitting, read the letter.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.447
Beebs, we rescued the CEO. We won!

08:51.531 --> 08:53.074
Gimme the hero shot!

08:53.658 --> 08:59.705
Welcome to the future, Baby Corp.
It tastes like mashed victory. Yee-haw!

[all] Yee-haw!

09:02.250 --> 09:03.334
[clapping]

09:03.417 --> 09:05.336
There you have it, Baby Corp,

09:05.419 --> 09:09.840
your new CEO,
a gigantic, ridiculous fool.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.384
Uh...

09:11.467 --> 09:13.302
-Wha--?
-[Estes grunts]

09:15.721 --> 09:18.933
Ma'am, you're working with the old people?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.561
Working with old people? No.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.272
[gasping]

09:28.442 --> 09:29.527
No.

09:30.695 --> 09:34.240
-[all scream]
-I am old people.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.241
[spits] Eh?

09:35.491 --> 09:38.286
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

09:38.369 --> 09:43.541
This whole time you've been
Turtleneck Superstar CE-Old Lady?

09:43.708 --> 09:47.044
And she's my old lady!

09:47.128 --> 09:48.963
Kissy, kissy!

[kissing, moaning]

09:53.801 --> 09:56.804
[all retching]

09:59.807 --> 10:04.395
We've been plotting this for years,
a simple two-part plan.

10:04.478 --> 10:10.192
One, distract from the outside,
care of my sweet snoogle-mint Frederic.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.402
[all screaming]

10:11.485 --> 10:15.906
Meanwhile, part two,
I sow chaos on the inside.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.327
If you solve the formula
for Stinkless Serum,

10:19.452 --> 10:22.788
you get the job of CEO.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.206
-[grunts]
-[teddy bear squeaks]

10:24.373 --> 10:25.750
[screaming]

10:26.042 --> 10:29.170
Bravo. You only made one mistake:

10:29.253 --> 10:32.089
I did crack the formula
for Stinkless Serum,

10:32.173 --> 10:35.760
a super weapon to change
the balance of love forever!

10:35.843 --> 10:38.554
[both laughing]

10:39.597 --> 10:42.892
Honestly, I expected more cowering.
Let me try it again.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.769
-Stinkless Serum!
-Wait.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.857
[sniffing] I recognize that one.
That's Tsunami Inferno,

10:49.940 --> 10:51.442
our biggest failure!

10:51.817 --> 10:53.444
It smells awful.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.446
No, it-- [screams]

10:55.529 --> 10:56.572
Yes, it does!

10:56.656 --> 10:59.200
Why would you lie about--
[gasps] Oh, no.

10:59.283 --> 11:02.328
You never wanted us to re-crack
Stinkless Serum.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.831
You were collecting
all the rotten, stinking failures.
