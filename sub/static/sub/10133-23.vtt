17:19.079 --> 17:20.623
But don't worry about

17:19.079 --> 17:20.623
Stephanie and Michelle

17:20.665 --> 17:22.625
because Kimmy's watching them.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.294
Yeah, this night just keeps

17:22.667 --> 17:25.294
getting better and better.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.716
Tanner? Gladstone?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.217
The sorority took a vote.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.511
We decided

17:31.258 --> 17:33.511
you've been humiliated enough.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.471
We're dropping the charges.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.850
Oh, thank you.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.850
Danny, we're free!

17:38.892 --> 17:40.560
Never ever hug me

17:38.892 --> 17:40.560
when I'm in prison.

Good job.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.508
We're back.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.431
Daddy's a girl!

18:20.224 --> 18:22.769
No, he's a woman.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.813
An ugly woman.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.902
I guess, you girls are wondering

18:28.357 --> 18:30.902
why we're wearing these clothes.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.863
Well, I can explain it all

18:30.944 --> 18:33.863
in just four words..

18:33.905 --> 18:37.742
...it's all Joey's fault!

18:37.784 --> 18:39.159
So is everything okay here?

18:39.201 --> 18:42.496
Kimmy taught me Patty Cake.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.499
She's really

18:42.538 --> 18:45.499
an excellent babysitter.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.963
Well, I'm very happy and

18:45.541 --> 18:49.963
incredibly shocked to hear that.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.380
Now you girls should go to bed.

18:51.422 --> 18:55.134
- Good night, Kimmy.

18:51.422 --> 18:55.134
- Good night, Steph.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.054
Come on, Michelle.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.391
I just hugged Kimmy Gibbler.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.478
Dad and Joey are in dresses.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.396
What a day!

19:09.816 --> 19:12.860
Kimmy, thank you

19:09.816 --> 19:12.860
for all your help.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.321
You did a good job tonight, so..

19:15.362 --> 19:17.490
...I'm gonna take a week

19:15.362 --> 19:17.490
off of your banishment.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.533
Wow! Thanks, Mr. T.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.578
I guess, a stretch in the big

19:19.575 --> 19:22.578
house really mellows a guy out.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.795
You guys haven't said a word

19:30.837 --> 19:32.964
to each other

19:30.837 --> 19:32.964
since I sprung you.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.425
I am sick of Joey

19:33.006 --> 19:36.425
and his dumb ideas!

19:36.467 --> 19:38.886
Dad, now you said,

19:36.467 --> 19:38.886
"it doesn't matter

19:38.928 --> 19:40.429
"who thinks up

19:38.928 --> 19:40.429
the dumb idea

19:40.471 --> 19:42.306
if the other person

19:40.471 --> 19:42.306
goes along with it."

19:42.348 --> 19:44.308
Yeah, but I didn't wanna go

19:42.348 --> 19:44.308
along with this.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.061
But you did.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.061
And do you know why you did?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.438
- Because you made me.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.438
- No.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.900
Because you need

19:49.480 --> 19:52.900
some fun in your life.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.029
One day we're gonna look back

19:52.942 --> 19:56.029
at this and laugh our heads off.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.571
I doubt it.

19:57.613 --> 20:01.034
Uh, dad, you might wanna

19:57.613 --> 20:01.034
take a look in the mirror.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.958
You know, if we, uh,

20:07.247 --> 20:08.958
teased our hair

20:09.000 --> 20:11.502
and kinda contoured our cheek

20:09.000 --> 20:11.502
bones a little bit, we'd be--

20:11.544 --> 20:14.338
We'd still be the ugliest women

20:11.544 --> 20:14.338
in the world!

20:17.299 --> 20:18.467
When you guys laugh like that

20:18.509 --> 20:21.220
it sounds just like

20:18.509 --> 20:21.220
me and Kimmy.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.722
Well, I guess, in a way

20:22.763 --> 20:25.558
Joey is sort of

20:22.763 --> 20:25.558
my Kimmy Gibbler.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.936
Thanks a lot, Danny.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.023
No, no. I mean,

20:28.978 --> 20:32.023
you make my life crazier.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.067
Heck, Joey,

20:32.065 --> 20:34.067
if it wasn't for you

20:34.108 --> 20:37.945
I'd be wearing pants

20:34.108 --> 20:37.945
right now.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.907
So, uh, bosom buddies?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.287
Nah, Joey, we're out of prison,

20:44.368 --> 20:47.287
give me a hug.

20:56.296 --> 20:59.508
Thank<i> God,</i>

20:56.296 --> 20:59.508
I'm back in the city.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.843
Jess, where have you been?

21:00.885 --> 21:02.511
I've been lost in the woods

21:02.553 --> 21:04.513
where there are no street signs

21:02.553 --> 21:04.513
because there are no streets

21:04.555 --> 21:06.974
because no one in their

21:04.555 --> 21:06.974
right mind goes in the woods!

21:08.726 --> 21:12.021
Man, what happened to you?

21:12.063 --> 21:14.440
Mother Nature kicked my butt.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.986
[sighs]

21:21.488 --> 21:25.451
Whoa! what, did you run

21:21.488 --> 21:25.451
into a pudding truck?

21:25.492 --> 21:26.869
I'm glad you're having

21:25.492 --> 21:26.869
fun with this.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.330
No, it just so happens

21:26.911 --> 21:30.330
I jumped into a swamp.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.958
I saw in a "Yogi Bear" cartoon

21:31.999 --> 21:34.543
that if a horde of angry bees

21:31.999 --> 21:34.543
are chasing you

21:34.585 --> 21:36.462
they won't follow you

21:34.585 --> 21:36.462
into a swamp.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.173
FYI, Yogi was wrong.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.676
Jess, were you attacked

21:40.674 --> 21:42.676
by a wild animal?

21:42.718 --> 21:45.179
No, I got thrown off

21:42.718 --> 21:45.179
my motorcycle.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.681
It was spooked by a snake.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.935
Or a snake-like twig.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.313
Look, why don't you go,

21:50.977 --> 21:54.313
get upstairs take a bath--

21:54.354 --> 21:56.065
- Danny?

21:54.354 --> 21:56.065
- Yeah?

21:58.525 --> 22:00.736
Is that a pearl earring

21:58.525 --> 22:00.736
you're wearing?

22:05.491 --> 22:09.703
Is there anything you'd

22:05.491 --> 22:09.703
Alike to talk to me about?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.497
You don't wanna know.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.417
I'm gonna go wash up.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.796
I've had a strange day.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.133
Although, yours might have

22:18.838 --> 22:22.133
been a little stranger.
