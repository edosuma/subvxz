01:35.022 --> 01:36.565
Where did you get the shoes from?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.849
What is that on your head?

01:40.266 --> 01:42.519
Ah really... It's a cloth shoe

01:43.603 --> 01:46.606
Is this just a cloth shoe in your eyes?

01:46.898 --> 01:49.776
Ah right! Being classy is perseverance

01:50.026 --> 01:51.819

You have still not come to your senses right?

02:21.516 --> 02:22.642
Sorry, teacher

02:23.434 --> 02:25.019
The inner me in my body

02:25.436 --> 02:27.563
that wishes to hide the fact but can't

02:28.022 --> 02:30.400
The inner me that wants to take control of me

02:32.485 --> 02:35.552
Regarding one having class...
Don't forget

02:36.447 --> 02:38.074
Letting go of everything

02:38.741 --> 02:40.618
is also a method

02:41.035 --> 02:41.661
Myself

02:42.036 --> 02:45.707
Can someone with nothing controls his fashion?

02:49.293 --> 02:50.712

There's an end to everything

03:58.488 --> 04:01.491
Same goes to the clouds, trees and even people
There will be a day

04:01.491 --> 04:02.450
when everything disappears on earth

04:03.409 --> 04:05.495
Anyway everything has an end

04:05.912 --> 04:08.206
and I'm just waiting for that end to come

04:09.004 --> 04:12.021
My life is a failure, really.

04:32.104 --> 04:34.106
Your hyung is playing a game on the internet

04:34.106 --> 04:35.983
And you walked out of range

04:36.275 --> 04:37.610
I lost because of you

04:38.027 --> 04:38.819
How are you going to make up for it?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.404
Sorry

04:40.947 --> 04:45.284
Woo Ki-myung

04:47.062 --> 04:48.108
Screaming early in the morning...

04:52.083 --> 04:54.126
Forget it
Your hyung have not eaten breakfast today

04:54.168 --> 04:55.214
Quickly go get some food for me

04:55.067 --> 04:56.026
Ah, Okay.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.590
Damn you, where are you going?

Hurry up!

05:33.666 --> 05:36.127
Is that blood on your nose?

05:36.252 --> 05:37.128
I thought you don't take breakfast?

05:37.211 --> 05:38.170
What's wrong with you today?

05:43.509 --> 05:48.306
Ah I'm late.

05:54.027 --> 05:55.862
Where did you go early in the morning?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.191
Come in front

06:04.113 --> 06:05.740
Who is he? He's from our class?

06:06.157 --> 06:07.366
Don't you know he is from our class?

06:07.045 --> 06:08.046
He is a legendary errand boy

06:08.617 --> 06:09.160
Ah

06:17.071 --> 06:19.990
Straighten your hands!

06:22.256 --> 06:23.090
Everybody listen up

06:23.257 --> 06:26.385
Woo Ki-myung will be transferring to Seoul

06:27.011 --> 06:28.262
because there are some problems at home

06:28.345 --> 06:29.513
That's for everyone to know

06:30.139 --> 06:32.933
What's wrong? You have to face them

06:38.939 --> 06:42.151
-What is he doing?
-Why is he walking towards them?

06:43.486 --> 06:48.908
-Oh...
-He's crazy

06:49.045 --> 06:50.046
Bye

07:14.085 --> 07:16.629
Aigoo, be careful of the steps

07:17.853 --> 07:18.479

Kwak Eun-jin

07:30.658 --> 07:31.116
Why?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.202
I have something on my face?

07:35.037 --> 07:35.996
You look ugly

07:37.832 --> 07:41.836
You really..
You can't be saying that to a girl

07:42.086 --> 07:43.157
That's not it
I'm saying that!

07:43.963 --> 07:45.297
Ah our binnie?

07:45.923 --> 07:47.132

Yes, hello

07:51.428 --> 07:52.596
I heard that you got first place in school

07:55.808 --> 07:58.875
No wonder
Smart children born out nicely

08:00.813 --> 08:01.397
What's your name?

08:02.189 --> 08:03.357
I'm Kwak Eun-jin

08:05.442 --> 08:07.736
We will be cooking Samgyeopsal for dinner later

08:08.279 --> 08:09.321
you can join us too

08:09.053 --> 08:10.262
It's okay, I have to go for lessons

08:11.156 --> 08:11.532
Tuition?

08:12.074 --> 08:13.993
Ah right, Ki-myung

08:14.451 --> 08:17.413
You should go for some lessons before the school starts

08:18.581 --> 08:20.165
Tuition or whatever

08:20.165 --> 08:21.083
I have no interest in them

08:21.292 --> 08:22.293
Study hard!

08:22.585 --> 08:23.586
Yes, thank you

08:24.336 --> 08:26.255
Hey, in any case you are in Seoul class

08:26.088 --> 08:26.964

Alright

08:34.722 --> 08:34.797
What is it?

08:35.722 --> 08:38.100
Your mom told me to take a proof shot

08:50.007 --> 08:50.758
I'm going

08:57.328 --> 09:06.837
Wow, she's so pretty!

09:28.067 --> 09:33.155

09:39.036 --> 09:39.703
Hi

Won-ho

10:08.774 --> 10:11.568
-Why are you so late?
-Oppa is waiting for you

10:14.154 --> 10:14.696
Are you hungry?

10:17.241 --> 10:18.534
Let's go eat something delicious

10:19.493 --> 10:20.327
You must have waited long

10:20.536 --> 10:21.078
No

10:21.286 --> 10:21.870
Hey

10:24.623 --> 10:25.457
**

10:26.458 --> 10:27.084
No

10:27.793 --> 10:28.252
Then

10:28.877 --> 10:29.545
Do you know Hye-jin?

10:34.174 --> 10:35.220
Then why are you acting like this?

10:38.929 --> 10:41.098
You make people uncomfortable by staring at them

10:42.975 --> 10:44.518
Yes or no?

10:45.031 --> 10:45.907
Bastard

10:47.604 --> 10:49.356
Yes or no?

10:52.025 --> 10:54.444
Doo-chi ah! Stop it

10:55.153 --> 10:56.989
Sorry about it.

11:04.079 --> 11:05.247
Saw that convenience store there?

11:06.206 --> 11:07.749
Go buy some bread to eat

11:09.376 --> 11:12.337
It's an apology so don't be angry or anything

11:14.673 --> 11:15.340
Accept it

11:20.637 --> 11:25.851
Ah, so you want me to personally buy it for you?

11:34.359 --> 11:36.612
No, I'll buy it myself

11:37.404 --> 11:38.405
Since you are going

11:38.905 --> 11:40.866
Please help me get one too when you are back

11:46.955 --> 11:48.457
Who is that kid?

12:05.932 --> 12:06.978
Son

12:07.476 --> 12:08.310
Mom, knock the door!

12:08.477 --> 12:08.552
How is your tuition

12:09.478 --> 12:10.187
Is it good? How is the class?

12:10.312 --> 12:11.104
Just like that

12:12.397 --> 12:14.464
Is this nice?

12:15.942 --> 12:18.028
You only wear uniform in class

12:18.987 --> 12:19.613
Eyy

12:23.007 --> 12:23.675
Mom

12:26.161 --> 12:29.498
Could you buy me a padding jacket?

12:29.915 --> 12:30.290
Padding jacket?

12:32.459 --> 12:32.751
This

12:39.633 --> 12:42.094
It cost $400 even after 60% discount!

12:42.386 --> 12:44.471
I see, so I guess we cant'?

12:46.056 --> 12:48.225
You think we can't?

12:48.433 --> 12:50.394
This is the first time my son is
asking me to buy some things

12:50.685 --> 12:51.311
This is basic

12:51.052 --> 12:53.054
If you want to buy
we must buy the best

12:54.272 --> 12:56.817
Really? Are you serious!?
Are you okay?

12:57.192 --> 12:58.235
But you must promise me

12:59.319 --> 13:02.361
Never give up and fight till the end

13:03.049 --> 13:04.258
Can you do it?

13:13.542 --> 13:14.876
Ah so hot!

13:15.794 --> 13:16.920
Is it spring already?

13:17.796 --> 13:18.755
Must I wear a short sleeve T-shirt?

13:20.549 --> 13:21.216
What the?

13:42.988 --> 13:43.780
Aigoo

13:52.455 --> 13:53.957
Pong~

13:56.167 --> 13:59.963
You got Won-ho all furious
a few days ago right?

14:01.047 --> 14:02.674
You kid...

14:04.926 --> 14:06.052
What are you doing
with your hands in the pocket

14:06.219 --> 14:07.554
What are you going to do?

14:09.389 --> 14:10.390
Ah you scared me!

14:10.849 --> 14:12.100
Make sure to return me my wallet

14:16.271 --> 14:19.190
It's your honour to meet me.

14:19.009 --> 14:20.176
This is your first time here right?

14:21.902 --> 14:23.278
You look like it

14:24.446 --> 14:25.530
But hey

14:25.572 --> 14:27.449
What is it?
What is it again?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.035
Do I really look like an idiot?

14:31.703 --> 14:32.454
Ah

14:34.331 --> 14:35.790
You sure know yourself

14:35.999 --> 14:37.417
*Some alien language*

14:37.709 --> 14:40.462
People like you shouldn't even have
the chance to talk to me

14:40.795 --> 14:42.380
Because you are ugly

14:43.256 --> 14:45.300
Because you are ugly so there's nothing
to be afraid of you

14:51.973 --> 14:53.069
Wait a minute
Why do you dare to wear "munclear" jacket?

14:56.478 --> 14:57.312
How much did you buy this?

14:57.812 --> 14:58.605
$400

14:58.647 --> 15:00.065
$400

15:01.399 --> 15:02.567
When and how did you get this?

15:02.651 --> 15:03.610
There's a sale yesterday

15:03.777 --> 15:05.403
Ah you stupid

15:05.612 --> 15:07.989
How can branded goods have discount

15:08.031 --> 15:10.450
No, it says the jacket is a limited edition

15:10.007 --> 15:12.802
"No, it says the jacket is a limited edition"

15:13.062 --> 15:14.188
Aigoo, let me take a look

15:16.456 --> 15:19.834
I told you! "muncler"

15:19.959 --> 15:22.420
Aigoo! I knew this would happen

15:22.629 --> 15:24.650
Can't help it, you look like an idiot

15:26.299 --> 15:28.677
Look! M u

15:30.345 --> 15:33.139
u!? Ah!

15:33.723 --> 15:36.810
Wait awhile, let me check

15:37.031 --> 15:39.123
Did you purchase it from bokhaksaeng web?

15:41.147 --> 15:41.689
.com?

15:43.983 --> 15:46.945
Aish

15:47.032 --> 15:48.053
How many rounds did we walked?

15:48.571 --> 15:51.366
Is this Africa or something?
Vietnam?

15:52.784 --> 15:53.910
Here it is!

15:54.285 --> 15:56.579
Ah, bokhaksaeng.com

I know you are inside!
Quickly come out!

16:07.132 --> 16:09.008
Open the door before I break the door

16:09.005 --> 16:10.340
You bastards! Ya!

16:11.719 --> 16:14.514
I'm calling the cops!
You can't run anymore!

16:18.017 --> 16:19.644

16:24.524 --> 16:26.025
Hurry up open the door!

16:33.199 --> 16:34.245
If a lock is locked outside

16:34.701 --> 16:36.536
Of course there's no one inside

16:37.495 --> 16:38.830
Please come in, my customer

16:38.083 --> 16:41.086
Kim Nam-jung - CEO of bokhaksaeng.com

17:00.643 --> 17:02.478
So you bought the jacket online

17:02.052 --> 17:03.178
and found out it is fake after you wore it?

17:04.396 --> 17:05.468
There's a limit even for fake goods

17:06.191 --> 17:07.567
You make everyone seems like an idiot

17:10.653 --> 17:12.696
Where is this from? It's good

17:12.078 --> 17:15.457

17:16.534 --> 17:17.452
Please follow me

17:27.587 --> 17:28.546
Saw it?

17:28.796 --> 17:30.465
It's an imitation

17:30.506 --> 17:31.507
Wasn't it written here?

17:35.261 --> 17:35.887
Where is it?

17:36.888 --> 17:37.639
Are you sick?

17:37.931 --> 17:38.932
Why are you so impatient?

17:39.098 --> 17:40.119
Look at A section

17:40.391 --> 17:41.142
A section

17:41.309 --> 17:42.355
Where is it exactly?

17:44.854 --> 17:45.980
You are kidding me

17:46.023 --> 17:47.442
Who in the world can see this?

17:47.069 --> 17:48.362
You kid, are you saying vulgarities now?

17:48.983 --> 17:51.194
Then you should have just written it clearly

17:51.277 --> 17:53.613
Is there a difference?

17:53.863 --> 17:55.239
This is lawfully legal

17:55.281 --> 17:57.033
You guys did not see it carefully
before you start complaining

17:57.002 --> 17:57.836
Am I right or wrong?

17:58.534 --> 18:00.828
No, in the first place
The news said imitation product was illegal

18:00.087 --> 18:03.104
Woah woah
My body needs some exercising

18:04.004 --> 18:06.381
(Vulgar)

18:06.793 --> 18:08.336
Can't you see this?

18:12.423 --> 18:13.716
You are cheating and there's no denying

18:16.969 --> 18:19.138
And you written monclear as the brand

18:19.222 --> 18:19.227
monclear?

18:19.889 --> 18:21.766
We have just seen the words
and they are totally different

18:21.974 --> 18:23.226
Is munclear

18:23.976 --> 18:24.072
Please refund me

18:27.939 --> 18:30.817
I'm really unlucky this time

18:33.528 --> 18:34.599
**

18:36.447 --> 18:37.031
Kids

18:38.116 --> 18:39.187
Wearing such expensive jackets

18:40.076 --> 18:41.703
and you feel successful?

18:41.994 --> 18:42.370
Yes

18:57.009 --> 18:58.052
Have you eaten?

18:58.261 --> 18:59.429
I've just eaten

19:01.639 --> 19:02.181
Follow me

19:05.518 --> 19:06.811
What's that kid doing!
Where are you going?

19:16.988 --> 19:17.989
Have you dyed your hair?

19:35.131 --> 19:36.883
Long time no see

19:43.181 --> 19:44.182
Good luck with your business

19:45.224 --> 19:45.850
Gave it to me

19:52.815 --> 19:53.774
Take it out

20:00.615 --> 20:07.246
Oppa!

20:28.351 --> 20:30.895
Kids...
Things like fashion

20:31.052 --> 20:32.220
If you follow others

20:32.688 --> 20:33.709
You will lose your personality

20:34.044 --> 20:36.380
Even if you are dying of hunger tomorrow

20:36.817 --> 20:37.693
**

20:37.735 --> 20:41.364
**

20:41.364 --> 20:42.865
This is call real fashion

20:43.532 --> 20:45.076
In that time of point

20:45.117 --> 20:51.540
You will feel the aura emitting from you

20:52.667 --> 20:54.001
Do you know what it's called?

20:56.003 --> 20:57.838
This is call class

20:58.589 --> 21:00.681
Wearing such expensive clothes

21:01.759 --> 21:04.136
With cheap jeans from the shops

21:04.178 --> 21:06.222
Can also make people feel your presence

21:06.639 --> 21:07.765
Do not be minded by the brands

21:07.765 --> 21:09.308
Follow your mind

21:09.392 --> 21:10.685
Is what makes you classy

21:11.143 --> 21:12.311
Class is what makes someone
that can't afford anything

21:12.353 --> 21:15.356
Win someone that can afford everything
Do you understand?

21:15.481 --> 21:17.733
You kids that have no class and money

21:22.655 --> 21:26.242
Do not talk about getting a refund
or whatever in the future

21:26.534 --> 21:27.118
Understand?

21:29.829 --> 21:30.871
That...

21:31.747 --> 21:34.208
Aish.. You (vulgar)...

21:34.291 --> 21:36.043
Are you hiring?

21:36.919 --> 21:37.503
What?

21:37.628 --> 21:40.006
Packing boxes or whatever
odd jobs is okay

21:40.256 --> 21:41.424
Anything is alright

21:42.299 --> 21:43.467
Me too! Director!

21:43.801 --> 21:45.344
Why am I your director?

21:46.554 --> 21:47.625
Boss

21:50.683 --> 21:55.187
Please accept me too

22:01.485 --> 22:04.029
This book Fashion Formula

22:04.196 --> 22:05.614
Is a teaching material used in Fashion School

22:05.074 --> 22:06.450
Year 1978

22:08.325 --> 22:09.410
Do you know who drew this?

22:09.702 --> 22:11.954
*Beep* (Some name) right?

22:13.873 --> 22:15.624
This kid is a failure

22:15.666 --> 22:16.687
Ki-myung, do you know?

22:18.627 --> 22:19.698
Is it Kim hongdo?
Ssireum (Korea traditional wrestling)

22:20.379 --> 22:21.672
Right.
You are normal

22:21.797 --> 22:24.216
So who do you think have the
most class in this picture?

22:25.009 --> 22:26.093
The wrestler in the middle

22:26.761 --> 22:27.803
What about you?

22:28.637 --> 22:30.264
The.. the wrestler

22:30.347 --> 22:31.056
This is how you feel?

22:31.014 --> 22:31.681
No

22:31.932 --> 22:32.600
Look carefully

22:32.767 --> 22:32.772
Here

22:33.476 --> 22:35.522
The person with most class

22:36.061 --> 22:38.647
Is him

22:38.814 --> 22:39.857
The person that covered his face
with a fan?

22:40.858 --> 22:43.819
Okay, dividing the painting into
section like this

22:44.069 --> 22:45.946
and this

22:46.197 --> 22:49.158
Which section of the drawing
has the most people gathered at?

22:50.117 --> 22:50.993
The top left side

22:51.327 --> 22:51.744
Correct

22:52.453 --> 22:53.412
This "class" we are saying

22:53.454 --> 22:54.747
Will automatically attract people
without them knowing

22:55.206 --> 22:57.875
That is why most people are gathered there

22:58.083 --> 22:58.667
Ah

22:58.959 --> 23:00.753
Then, this person

23:01.212 --> 23:03.130
Look carefully here

23:03.038 --> 23:04.123
Looking at this

23:04.757 --> 23:06.342
Ssireum is very interesting

23:06.592 --> 23:08.219
This person has two identities

23:08.219 --> 23:09.595
He originally has to be seated on the opposite

23:10.679 --> 23:13.933
So he planned carefully to sit at the top left

23:14.141 --> 23:17.158
to be able to display his stunning physical line

23:17.478 --> 23:19.146
What does the stunning physical line means?

23:19.188 --> 23:20.481
Good question

23:20.814 --> 23:25.152
Physical line means the line whereby your
clothes wrapped on your body

23:25.319 --> 23:27.947
The physical line for the clothes differ

23:28.239 --> 23:31.533
How you made use of your physical line
to show your classiness

23:32.076 --> 23:34.954
Is what the current popular
fashion brands are doing

23:37.706 --> 23:38.332
Now, next

23:39.333 --> 23:42.211
In these group of people that
display their classy aura

23:44.088 --> 23:45.339
Do you feel anything weird?

23:45.798 --> 23:46.465
What is it?

23:46.882 --> 23:48.968
The classy aura he is showing

23:49.468 --> 23:50.636
His eyes

23:50.719 --> 23:52.388
What is he trying to mean?

23:53.305 --> 23:55.683
He is facing that girl

23:55.724 --> 23:57.601
Three seconds earlier and
giving her eye signal

24:03.816 --> 24:06.527
The most important thing in fashion is

24:08.779 --> 24:12.491
Physical line, Physical line, Physical line

24:13.033 --> 24:14.118
Ah

24:16.745 --> 24:18.622
Your leg, open it wider

24:25.462 --> 24:32.636
Tighten your muscles! Start!

24:33.679 --> 24:35.097
Do it here

24:39.476 --> 24:40.853
Fighting! One!

24:42.813 --> 24:44.648
Straighten! Straighten!

24:52.099 --> 24:54.268
One Two Three! That's right

24:55.159 --> 24:56.326
Point your finger out

24:56.952 --> 24:58.328
Yes that's it.

25:16.972 --> 25:18.223
OK!

25:18.974 --> 25:21.477
The new school semester is starting soon

25:21.081 --> 25:23.667
Please proceed to the assembly hall

25:24.396 --> 25:25.355
I'm so nervous! It's the big day today!

25:25.439 --> 25:27.816
There are many students that mistaken this
for a fashion show but

25:28.108 --> 25:29.401
Ah... it is a fashion show

25:29.401 --> 25:30.068
**

25:30.235 --> 25:31.403
Don't worry

25:31.612 --> 25:33.113
I've been waiting for this day

25:33.405 --> 25:33.947
Our name

25:34.364 --> 25:35.949
Kian High prince (Not sure about this)

25:36.002 --> 25:37.545
Kian High prince my ass

25:37.951 --> 25:39.453
Go away. You pig look alike

25:39.745 --> 25:42.790
-Oh, the door...
-What is happening?

25:44.583 --> 25:45.667
-Gas?

25:45.959 --> 25:47.005
It's been a long time we have something exciting

25:53.801 --> 25:55.219
Ah! What is this!

25:55.026 --> 25:56.778
My eyes are burning.
What is this... My eyes!

25:57.054 --> 25:57.805
Gagwomen?

25:58.305 --> 26:02.434
Is she Kwak Eun-jin?
Did she do this on purpose?

26:02.768 --> 26:03.894
Please come to your senses!

26:07.189 --> 26:08.774
What is this? She's red like fire

26:11.276 --> 26:16.490
K..K..Kim Hae-na?
Is Kim Hae-na!

26:16.049 --> 26:17.300
She's looking at me now

26:17.908 --> 26:20.536
What is this feeling coming
out of my perfect body?

26:20.577 --> 26:21.370
Definitely because of money

26:21.578 --> 26:24.206
Cha-lang(Bouncing effect)

26:24.289 --> 26:26.500
It's going to explode like her chest.

26:26.833 --> 26:28.418
(Sound effect)

26:29.044 --> 26:33.173
Kim Hae-na!
Get away bastard!

26:33.465 --> 26:47.688
-Get away
-She's beautiful

26:48.105 --> 26:49.314
Flirtatious

26:49.606 --> 26:50.691
Ya, are you ready?

26:51.149 --> 26:55.445
Ah, I'm starting to feel the cold

26:56.697 --> 26:57.906
Oppa that was rumored

26:57.948 --> 27:00.993
To be cool all the time

27:00.993 --> 27:03.014
He rejected every phone calls from broadcasting companies

27:05.914 --> 27:06.873
So handsome!

27:10.046 --> 27:12.924
So cold

27:18.593 --> 27:18.689
What is this light?

27:20.637 --> 27:23.432
It's Kim Won-ho and Park Hye-jin
-Ah so hot!

27:23.515 --> 27:24.536
I have to stand the brightness of two suns

27:24.808 --> 27:27.352
I have only one eye!

27:27.436 --> 27:28.270
There's two.

27:28.895 --> 27:30.897
They are definitely the brightest star

27:31.231 --> 27:32.252
You wore sunglasses right?

27:32.899 --> 27:35.193
Give me your sunglasses!
Hurry!

27:37.279 --> 27:40.157
He's handsome

27:40.407 --> 27:41.950
I'm unable to go near
because they are too hot

27:47.205 --> 27:47.748
What's happening?

27:55.589 --> 27:55.594
Woo Ki-myung?

27:57.257 --> 27:59.051
Look at his bangs

27:59.134 --> 28:01.762
Did he become blind just for fashion?

28:01.803 --> 28:02.929
(**)

28:03.513 --> 28:04.514
How many inches is that?

28:04.089 --> 28:08.176
5? 4? No 3.5

28:09.269 --> 28:11.646
Fashion King is here!
Get on the throne!

28:12.773 --> 28:14.649
(**)

28:36.588 --> 28:39.630
He snatched Hye-jin from Won-ho?
Because of his fashion?

28:48.085 --> 28:49.503
Excuse me!

28:50.031 --> 28:50.949
Who is he?

28:51.978 --> 28:54.272
Aigoo! Are you crazy? You kid

28:55.106 --> 28:56.358
Hurry up and go queue

28:56.983 --> 28:57.734
I'm sorry

29:05.826 --> 29:09.120
Excuse me! Excuse me!

29:09.538 --> 29:13.542
-Interesting..
-Interesting..

29:21.007 --> 29:22.676
Good

29:22.717 --> 29:23.510
Facial expression

29:28.557 --> 29:29.015
Turn your head

29:30.392 --> 29:31.643
Have you prepared well?

29:32.018 --> 29:33.436
Didn't you said you were attending
the fashion competition?

29:33.728 --> 29:34.749
Of course, everything went successfully

29:35.397 --> 29:38.316
But, there are something that
I don't like

29:38.441 --> 29:40.110
What don't your like about it?

29:40.277 --> 29:43.154
I'm unhappy with the guy that
transferred to the school

29:43.363 --> 29:45.115
Who? Your girlfriend?

29:47.242 --> 29:50.870
There's someone like that
A person with many secrets

29:52.789 --> 29:57.827
In my heart, he's an enemy

30:01.047 --> 30:02.591
Please speak your heart

30:05.135 --> 30:06.386
Are you pissed?

30:06.553 --> 30:08.972
(**)

30:12.559 --> 30:14.185
Let's go back to business

30:16.021 --> 30:18.565
-When are you leaving?
-Ah, so annoying

30:19.649 --> 30:21.276
I will tell my Dad personally

30:21.526 --> 30:24.404
He stayed in the hospital there's too much
commotion outside. You should know better.

30:24.404 --> 30:26.425
That's why I said I will talk to him when I see him

30:27.073 --> 30:28.366
Please inform him I would like to meet him

30:30.201 --> 30:32.162
Can I say something?

30:33.496 --> 30:35.999
Do you want to get approval from your dad?

30:35.999 --> 30:39.377
Then, do what your Dad wants you to do

30:39.753 --> 30:41.004
Stop doing things like this

30:44.007 --> 30:46.009
-Ah!
-Ya!

30:46.843 --> 30:48.261
Get up

30:50.638 --> 30:53.391
Are you crazy?

30:53.516 --> 30:56.227
It's all because of you that
makes Won-ho disgrace

30:58.938 --> 31:01.649
Ah, did not know he was like that

31:03.401 --> 31:05.737
Won-ho is the boss in the school

31:05.779 --> 31:09.074
I don't know. Not sure if he fights well but
he is good in every other things

31:09.699 --> 31:10.795
He has a studious and rich face

31:12.118 --> 31:16.373
Ever since his dad gave him
money and nothing else, he became like this

31:16.079 --> 31:20.416
Good job!

31:21.711 --> 31:23.630
Crawl under my leg

31:24.422 --> 31:25.493
Yah! Are you finding trouble?

31:26.174 --> 31:28.551
You are dead if you go confront them now

31:29.177 --> 31:31.012
Are you afraid, Chang-joo?

31:32.806 --> 31:33.431
What?

31:34.682 --> 31:36.309
I'm not a tiny bit afraid

31:36.081 --> 31:37.332
Hey

31:44.015 --> 31:44.891
Huh?

31:45.527 --> 31:46.694
Please stop

31:50.573 --> 31:51.658
Ya...

31:55.012 --> 32:01.476
Do you think coming out like that is cool?

32:01.918 --> 32:02.752
Is this it?

32:02.752 --> 32:04.003
That's not it

32:04.462 --> 32:06.673
But what you are doing is not cool either

32:07.048 --> 32:09.551
Stop talking down to me, (Vulgar)

32:14.305 --> 32:19.227
Ki-myung, saw that?
This shirt cost a few million won

32:19.394 --> 32:25.149
If just ignoring this can do the trick, don't
you think it is a bit nonsensical? Why don't you pay for him?

32:25.817 --> 32:26.888
It's not very expensive to you right?

32:28.403 --> 32:31.322
It's not. So what?

32:31.364 --> 32:34.576
So please stop all this

32:40.582 --> 32:42.000
You said to stop

32:42.792 --> 32:44.335
what do you mean?

32:44.711 --> 32:47.380
Who are you to interfere with my belongings

32:48.464 --> 32:51.342
Then, hit me

32:51.759 --> 32:54.846
Woah, cool

33:03.062 --> 33:04.731
Alright

33:11.446 --> 33:12.739
That's it

33:37.043 --> 33:40.421
Ya, can you be serious?

33:41.809 --> 33:44.354
Don't you know about the current situation now?

33:45.188 --> 33:46.234

That's why I asked you here

34:47.041 --> 34:48.960

You are the only guy I invited

35:26.455 --> 35:28.082
Why do you keep following me?

35:28.249 --> 35:29.345
When did I follow you?
I'm also going home

35:30.251 --> 35:33.296
That's why I'm saying, we are staying
in the same building. Why walk behind me?

35:34.213 --> 35:35.381
Let's go together

35:41.929 --> 35:45.641
Woo Ki-myung. What are you planning this weekend?

35:45.683 --> 35:49.520
Weekend?

35:49.562 --> 35:52.579
If there are nothing going on, do you want to go to
the School Street (Shopping street outside of school) with me?

35:52.094 --> 35:53.387
Ah, stop talking about school.

35:55.276 --> 35:57.570
No, its not the school.
It is the School Street

36:01.574 --> 36:06.913
Ah Eun-jin, what gifts do you expect from a guy
if a guy were to get you one?

Thank you

38:13.456 --> 38:14.748
Beautiful

38:22.173 --> 38:23.465
Nothing

38:24.175 --> 38:25.050
Huh?

38:25.551 --> 38:26.622
This life is screwed

39:24.068 --> 39:26.779
Oh, Won-ho ah

39:36.058 --> 39:37.017
Park Hye-jin

39:39.124 --> 39:40.876
What are you doing here at night?

39:44.672 --> 39:47.633
Is that from Ki-myung?

39:48.968 --> 39:51.887
Yes, why?

39:52.763 --> 39:54.431
I can't?

39:54.473 --> 39:58.811
Hye-jin ah, no one dares to
snatch anything I owns from me.

39:59.561 --> 40:04.358
(**)

40:04.525 --> 40:08.320
Stop saying things like that.
Am I an object you own?

40:15.244 --> 40:16.745
Happy birthday

40:27.798 --> 40:29.341
(Some hwatu card game terminology)

40:32.072 --> 40:33.143
Why are you back so late?

40:35.389 --> 40:36.460
Ya, didn't you said my mom was sick?

40:37.391 --> 40:40.436
Yes, she was really sick.
Look! She's coughing

40:42.187 --> 40:45.065
Ah, my threat is killing me!

40:45.482 --> 40:47.443
Inflammation

40:48.777 --> 40:51.905
Aunt, that's wrong

40:52.003 --> 40:52.099
You saw it?

40:53.073 --> 40:54.491
I saw it

40:56.869 --> 40:58.370
Let me off please

40:58.579 --> 40:59.872
Aigoo, that's my card

41:02.374 --> 41:03.375
Eun-jin ah

41:05.043 --> 41:06.295
Accept this

41:07.045 --> 41:09.131
I bought for a friend a birthday gift and
I bought you one too.

41:09.381 --> 41:10.507
Whose birthday is it?

41:11.216 --> 41:12.342
Ah..

41:13.302 --> 41:15.179
Anyway, I have a share and that's enough

41:18.265 --> 41:19.433
Daebak

41:19.516 --> 41:20.537
Do you like it?

41:21.031 --> 41:23.074
Did you buy this for me to study?

41:23.729 --> 41:25.147
Didn't you like to study?

41:25.189 --> 41:27.483
Are you crazy? Who loves to study?

41:27.566 --> 41:28.984
It's because I have to study that's why I studied

41:29.735 --> 41:31.737
I thought you wanted to enter to Seoul University
that's why you studied so hard

41:31.778 --> 41:33.947
I know, I will enter it. You don't have to worry.

41:34.198 --> 41:35.407
Give it to me if you don't like it

41:35.449 --> 41:36.450
No

41:36.007 --> 41:38.343
Don't be shock when I used it completely

41:43.373 --> 41:44.541
Ya Woo Ki-myung

41:45.005 --> 41:46.048
What?

41:47.377 --> 41:48.962
Do I really look ugly?

41:50.297 --> 41:51.173
No

41:51.256 --> 41:53.467
Whatever. (Something about her image is ruined already?)

41:58.263 --> 41:59.932
Ah really...

42:19.618 --> 42:21.787
Both are mine

42:22.579 --> 42:26.208
Kian High school sports festival is the most
fashionable sports festival right?

42:26.208 --> 42:27.501
Yes yes.

42:27.542 --> 42:34.174
It's not whether you came in first in sports.
It's about the fashion that they wear.

42:34.174 --> 42:36.718
Who will be winner of fashion
Makes people excited

42:36.843 --> 42:39.888
Now lets take a look at this team and see
if they can win

42:40.222 --> 42:41.268
(**)

42:41.765 --> 42:45.519
Ya, shouldnt such normal people go look after kids?

42:45.936 --> 42:47.957
I'm not sure if shes the kid or the kid's mother

42:48.313 --> 42:49.731
She's the kid's mother

42:51.108 --> 42:53.652
He coolly sneak the ball pass those people

42:54.277 --> 42:56.154

Everyone fell down

43:12.796 --> 43:14.965

He is starting soon

43:35.485 --> 43:36.611
Warming up

43:37.279 --> 43:38.488
I wish to beat you into a pulp

43:38.989 --> 43:40.035
(Some taunting)

43:40.049 --> 43:42.635
What is wrong with Chang-joo vietnam style one-piece dress

43:43.326 --> 43:45.328
Chang-joo ah, where is Ki-myung?

43:45.037 --> 43:46.372
He should be in the next relay

44:08.518 --> 44:10.610

45:05.325 --> 45:07.869

What is going on?

45:08.537 --> 45:12.415
Woo Ki-myung
Showcasing his bird-like fashion

45:12.916 --> 45:15.669
Our Won-ho being too simple is not right

45:15.669 --> 45:16.336

45:27.043 --> 45:28.114
He is definitely representing mens fashion

45:29.391 --> 45:31.726
Can he beat Ki-myung?

45:32.269 --> 45:35.605
Is this reality or a fashion walk?

45:35.647 --> 45:39.192
What are they doing? Are they turning this into
a fashion runway?

45:39.401 --> 45:43.154

45:46.157 --> 45:47.228

Is he not feeling well there?

46:01.798 --> 46:07.857

Why are you here?

51:05.059 --> 51:06.602
I wanted to buy some clothes

51:08.563 --> 51:10.231
This place looks okay

51:15.403 --> 51:18.531
But, its fake

51:18.823 --> 51:20.366
There's nothing important with brands

51:20.825 --> 51:22.368
As long as its fashionable when you wear it.

51:23.327 --> 51:24.348
Fashionable...

51:38.217 --> 51:45.099
Anyway, you guys shouldn't be too arrogant
You will get into trouble

51:46.684 --> 51:47.685
Ah

52:00.531 --> 52:04.118
Ya, why did he come here to find trouble?

52:06.537 --> 52:08.581
He's really a psycho

52:13.627 --> 52:15.338

53:05.513 --> 53:08.349
Hyung, how can you say this!
What do you think we are?

53:08.039 --> 53:10.584
Ah, which idiot did this?

53:11.519 --> 53:14.772
What imitation did I sell?
When did I sell imitation stuff?

53:16.069 --> 53:17.738
And now I'm being handcuffed

53:18.567 --> 53:22.071

54:02.528 --> 54:06.156

you should fight with me.

55:07.176 --> 55:08.218
Doo-chi ah

55:19.313 --> 55:24.326
I've warned you. You will die if you are too arrogant.

55:49.093 --> 55:50.719
Does this make sense?

55:52.763 --> 55:55.557
Just because no one saw the incident,
they just close this case

55:59.269 --> 56:01.397
It's done by Kim Won-ho that crazy guy

56:03.774 --> 56:05.651
Hyung, wake up

56:06.568 --> 56:09.071
Wake up and find that kid.

56:09.863 --> 56:11.115
It's not like this.

56:11.782 --> 56:14.701
Although everything can be solved with money
but it's not for cases like this

56:16.245 --> 56:17.316
Kim Won-ho this dog

56:19.748 --> 56:20.819
I won't rest like this

56:22.709 --> 56:24.253
Ya, Chang-joo ah!

56:49.194 --> 56:54.283
A cat pleads by closing its ear

56:55.033 --> 56:56.994
A dog pleads by showing its tummy

56:58.203 --> 57:00.038
Do you know how a human pleads?

57:02.916 --> 57:04.793
Just bend your head

57:08.038 --> 57:09.540
Yes, that's the way

57:10.966 --> 57:12.012
Good job

57:29.318 --> 57:30.736
Why did you like this?

57:31.028 --> 57:32.029
What?

57:32.112 --> 57:36.450
-I'm asking you why are you like this?
-I've not started with you yet

57:37.242 --> 57:41.496
Then, let's start

58:08.148 --> 58:10.525
It's Woo Ki-myung.
It's that pervert.

58:10.609 --> 58:12.027
Ya! Who filmed this?

58:12.069 --> 58:13.487
Ya! It's dirtying my eyes

58:17.366 --> 58:20.702
Ya! He's really eating it!

58:24.581 --> 58:25.749
Quick run!

58:35.258 --> 58:36.802
He's a total idiot

58:38.022 --> 58:39.273
I'm disappointed

58:42.182 --> 58:43.600
Are you satisfied?

58:55.821 --> 58:57.322
Idiot

59:01.493 --> 59:02.564
Your name is not Woo Ki-myung

59:04.371 --> 59:07.624
I heard you are called ** (A word play of his name)

59:14.673 --> 59:17.300
Idiot

59:19.678 --> 59:23.181
Damn you! Arrogant.

59:27.352 --> 59:28.478
Stupid

59:33.065 --> 59:34.817
Ki-myung ah, are you alright?

59:43.091 --> 59:45.010
What is this?
They are a couple?

59:46.163 --> 59:47.234

59:48.331 --> 59:50.709

59:51.042 --> 59:53.378
Ready, action

59:53.628 --> 59:59.259
Woo Ki-myung, stop finding me from now on.
You make me uncomfortable

59:59.301 --> 01:00:00.427
You mean woman!

01:00:01.553 --> 01:00:03.555
Do you think it is fun playing with
someone feelings?

01:00:04.848 --> 01:00:06.141
Hey hey...

01:00:07.726 --> 01:00:12.439
Kwak Eun-jin, you guys are together

01:00:12.564 --> 01:00:14.357
You are great

01:00:17.011 --> 01:00:19.055
It's also a talent to be able to born to look like that

01:00:19.905 --> 01:00:21.781
Both of them make me want to puke

01:00:22.365 --> 01:00:23.283
Hey

01:00:24.326 --> 01:00:26.372
I suggest you to study hard to get into the University

01:00:26.786 --> 01:00:28.455
Before I kill you

01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:32.918
Do you think you are watching a show?

01:01:06.826 --> 01:01:06.922
Are you okay?

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:10.617
Yes

01:01:12.332 --> 01:01:13.124
What about you?

01:01:16.503 --> 01:01:17.462
What to do?

01:01:18.254 --> 01:01:20.548
You can't even hold a pen now

01:01:22.258 --> 01:01:24.970
Do you study with your hand?
It's with your head

01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:32.185
Don't be troubled by this incident, Woo Ki-myung

01:01:32.477 --> 01:01:36.565
Be like a man and go to school

01:01:37.357 --> 01:01:38.566
You have to protect yourself

01:01:39.067 --> 01:01:39.651
No?

01:01:40.986 --> 01:01:42.904
Thank you, Kwak Eun-jin

01:01:52.033 --> 01:01:56.121
Let me heal you

01:02:05.802 --> 01:02:08.179
Ah, there's something that makes me want to cry

01:02:09.639 --> 01:02:11.182
Am I really ugly?

01:02:11.085 --> 01:02:12.461
That was sudden

01:02:14.394 --> 01:02:15.478
No, you are not ugly

01:02:15.478 --> 01:02:17.545
Wrong! You could not answer immediately

01:02:20.233 --> 01:02:23.236
No. I said you're not ugly

01:02:37.459 --> 01:02:38.418
Woo Ki-myung

01:02:44.009 --> 01:02:46.303
You have gotten your new uniform,
why aren't you going to school?

01:02:51.431 --> 01:02:52.849
You ran away right?

01:02:53.933 --> 01:02:55.236
It's Busan.

01:02:55.237 --> 01:02:58.022
You ran away and others will dig your past

01:02:58.001 --> 01:02:59.003
Are you going to transfer school again?

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.368
Are you going to transfer school all the way to University?

01:03:03.036 --> 01:03:04.037
Are you a celebrity?

01:03:04.378 --> 01:03:05.821
You think you are filming Running Man?

01:03:06.821 --> 01:03:08.406
You idiot

01:03:10.533 --> 01:03:10.629

There's no secret concept

01:04:32.058 --> 01:04:34.835
I only hope to gain recognition from someone
through fashion program

01:04:36.035 --> 01:04:38.200
To be able to stand proudly in front of that person

01:04:38.438 --> 01:04:46.965
-Who is that person you are saying?
-It's a secret. I'll tell you next time.

01:04:47.257 --> 01:04:55.341
-One last question, what is fashion to Won-ho?
-Erm, one's character

01:04:56.097 --> 01:04:58.558

Are you tired?

01:05:19.662 --> 01:05:20.955
Should we move house?

01:05:34.761 --> 01:05:38.473
Mom, I'm not running anymore

01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:42.185
I have things that I want to do

01:05:56.657 --> 01:05:57.408
Hyung

01:06:17.178 --> 01:06:19.055
I've been to the police station so many times

01:06:19.764 --> 01:06:21.265
I've gained nothing

01:06:21.474 --> 01:06:23.267
It's useless. It's a joke

01:06:24.143 --> 01:06:26.687
But what can I do? That's the truth

01:06:26.687 --> 01:06:30.358
We are born to be unable to win those
that are born to be rich

01:06:32.036 --> 01:06:35.998
Hyung, didn't you do that too?

01:06:37.823 --> 01:06:39.915

01:07:21.534 --> 01:07:25.121
Muscles are train using different parts of the body

01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:27.248

01:14:46.603 --> 01:14:48.230
are all about you

01:14:48.023 --> 01:14:48.098
Oh is it?

01:14:50.148 --> 01:14:54.653
Ki-myung ah, (**)

01:14:55.278 --> 01:14:57.364
No matter what, my heart

01:14:58.281 --> 01:15:00.283
Feels looks like I want you to be mine

01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:30.188
Where in the world did this kid go?

01:15:40.866 --> 01:15:42.993
Diamonds are girl's best friend

01:15:43.076 --> 01:15:45.370
Then boy's best friend is

01:15:45.453 --> 01:15:46.872
Suit?

01:15:47.539 --> 01:15:49.666
Today fashion mission is

01:15:49.749 --> 01:15:50.625
What is it?

01:15:51.543 --> 01:15:54.212
-It's Gabbana, you idiot.
-Don't you know about this?

01:15:54.588 --> 01:15:56.006
Gabbana?

01:15:56.715 --> 01:15:58.091
Ah, suit

01:15:58.133 --> 01:16:00.302
Suit must be the last mission

01:16:01.052 --> 01:16:02.971
I'm too slow to not think about it

01:16:03.763 --> 01:16:05.807
Ki-myung shouldn't have any problem, right?

01:16:05.891 --> 01:16:07.309
Here we have 20 contestant gathered together

01:16:07.309 --> 01:16:10.061
What to do? They are all shaking
because they are nervous

01:16:10.103 --> 01:16:13.170
I will introduce them one by one

01:16:14.316 --> 01:16:15.817
Lets do it together

01:16:15.984 --> 01:16:17.319
Just listen

01:16:17.569 --> 01:16:20.780
Then, suit mission start!

01:16:20.989 --> 01:16:23.074
In this suit mission,

01:16:23.366 --> 01:16:27.621
The contestant will have to enter 5 rooms
and chose a 5 suit

01:16:27.954 --> 01:16:29.497
They have to take note

01:16:29.748 --> 01:16:33.835
In each room, there is a lousy item hidden in it

01:16:34.044 --> 01:16:36.588
Everyone has to complete it in 1 minute

01:16:36.588 --> 01:16:39.466
That's right! Oh, I'm so nervous

01:16:43.011 --> 01:16:44.387
The first contestant

01:16:44.429 --> 01:16:46.723
That shoe

01:16:46.931 --> 01:16:47.807
Right

01:16:52.812 --> 01:16:56.274
He is borrowing the concept of a monk robe, right?

01:16:56.316 --> 01:16:57.817
Pass! All pass!

01:16:58.193 --> 01:16:59.986
Hyuk-soo

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:06.284
-He swiftly chose this checkered shirt.
-Right

01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:10.246
-He combined the pattern together
-Right

01:17:10.246 --> 01:17:11.267
He is too ambitious

01:17:11.498 --> 01:17:13.249
Next, Bobby

01:17:13.875 --> 01:17:15.251
(**)

01:17:17.921 --> 01:17:19.464
He's a student from Brazil

01:17:20.173 --> 01:17:22.175
His has African hair

01:17:22.425 --> 01:17:24.844
Oh, what is going on?

01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:28.586
What is this?

01:17:30.767 --> 01:17:32.685
He posed like he's taking a dump

01:17:32.727 --> 01:17:34.979
It makes the scene uncomfortable

01:17:35.772 --> 01:17:38.900
The strongest competitor, Kim Won-ho

01:17:38.983 --> 01:17:41.027
(**)

01:17:42.153 --> 01:17:47.117
He took all the best fashion item on his hands

01:17:47.283 --> 01:17:49.035
Oh his eyes.

01:17:49.077 --> 01:17:51.371
(**)

01:17:51.413 --> 01:17:52.455
Let's take a look again

01:17:55.542 --> 01:17:58.420
So much sense.
He has so much sense.

01:17:58.503 --> 01:18:00.755
Sure enough

01:18:01.631 --> 01:18:04.342
-Kim Won-ho confidence face
-Pass

01:18:04.467 --> 01:18:07.345
Pass, definitely he's a pass

01:18:07.387 --> 01:18:09.139
Woo Ki-myung

01:18:09.347 --> 01:18:11.891
He's a bit panicking

01:18:12.183 --> 01:18:14.686
Hey, come here

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:22.777
Don't take that, choose carefully

01:18:23.736 --> 01:18:24.362
Follow what I say

01:18:24.404 --> 01:18:27.282
You have to choose one with shoulder padding
and nice buttons

01:18:27.323 --> 01:18:28.199
What?

01:18:28.283 --> 01:18:29.951
Choose one with sponge padding

01:18:29.993 --> 01:18:31.161
What sponge padding?

01:18:31.369 --> 01:18:32.036
Your mouth is like a sponge

01:18:32.012 --> 01:18:33.108
Hurry hurry! Just take the red one

01:18:34.205 --> 01:18:35.748
The red one, hurry

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:39.294
He's onto the next room

01:18:41.004 --> 01:18:43.548
Ya, the zippers for the pants are important

01:18:45.049 --> 01:18:46.120
No, not that. Take the others

01:18:47.177 --> 01:18:48.928
Back abit

01:18:50.068 --> 01:18:52.279
Turn to your back

01:18:56.394 --> 01:18:58.521
You idiot, why do you take the red pants

01:18:58.605 --> 01:19:00.626
-Don't I have to match the top and bottom?
-Get the others

01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:03.568
Time is running out

01:19:03.985 --> 01:19:05.320
Quickly take the blue one

01:19:07.488 --> 01:19:10.533
Aish, if you don't know, just take the blue one

01:19:14.787 --> 01:19:16.164
Hyung, what to do?

01:19:17.165 --> 01:19:21.836
Ki-myung ah, we are dead!
See you in our next lives

01:19:29.719 --> 01:19:32.305
Ah, that is the bad item!

01:19:34.057 --> 01:19:39.070
Ah, why did I take this. I'm so dead

01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:42.523
He's still changing

01:19:42.565 --> 01:19:43.611
There's still one more

01:19:44.108 --> 01:19:46.069
He's coming out. Woo Ki-myung

01:19:46.903 --> 01:19:49.197
A totally new fashion style

01:19:49.364 --> 01:19:53.910
It's unique way to wear it

01:19:53.952 --> 01:19:56.496
Woo Ki-myung! Woo Ki-myung!

01:19:56.746 --> 01:20:01.000
He really showcase new fashion style by those shirts

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.001
He is good

01:20:02.043 --> 01:20:06.106
Pass pass pass! All pass!

01:20:07.173 --> 01:20:11.386
He succeeded! He succeeded!
This is great

01:20:35.785 --> 01:20:37.537
Hyung, why aren't you coming?

01:20:44.085 --> 01:20:45.211
Hyung, oh looks like he's here

01:20:45.253 --> 01:20:46.504
I'm putting the phone down

01:20:58.516 --> 01:21:00.059
How have you been?

01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:05.189
Do I look ugly?

01:21:05.982 --> 01:21:07.053
No, you look beautiful

01:21:07.692 --> 01:21:08.818
Ding dong deng (Correct)

01:21:08.901 --> 01:21:11.946
When a girl ask you this, this is how you should
should reply without hesitating

01:21:18.786 --> 01:21:23.583
We are celebrating Ki-myung win and
Eun-jin getting into a University

01:21:24.167 --> 01:21:28.588
-Come on baby
-Thank you

01:21:33.676 --> 01:21:37.221
Eun-jin, why did you became so pretty?

01:21:37.221 --> 01:21:38.292
Chang-joo, why are you stuttering
all of a sudden?

01:21:39.557 --> 01:21:42.476
Did I? Chang-joo, do you remember me?

01:21:44.854 --> 01:21:47.940
Here here here..
Finally, the lowly us

01:21:48.691 --> 01:21:50.067
Except Eun-jin

01:21:52.236 --> 01:21:53.282
Knock knock knock

01:21:59.744 --> 01:22:01.370
He is Kim Nam-jung

01:22:01.412 --> 01:22:02.788
Woo Ki-myung shi

01:22:03.998 --> 01:22:06.751
To all contestant that entered
the finals, congratulations!

01:22:06.792 --> 01:22:08.711
Have you received your gifts?

01:22:09.045 --> 01:22:11.547
This gift is your final mission

01:22:12.006 --> 01:22:16.010
(Something about using the dress for a date)
I'm anticipating it

01:22:22.141 --> 01:22:24.727
Hyung, what do we do?

01:22:25.144 --> 01:22:29.273
Erm, date..

01:22:30.983 --> 01:22:32.985
I have never been in a relationship

01:22:39.492 --> 01:22:40.868
Chang-joo

01:22:46.248 --> 01:22:49.251
Woo Ki-myung got into the Top 4

01:22:49.502 --> 01:22:51.523
Will Woo Ki-myung be put down by him?

01:22:59.929 --> 01:23:02.515
Didn't I said I will do everything myself
and that you don't interfere?

01:23:03.683 --> 01:23:05.351
Dad, I...

01:23:05.351 --> 01:23:06.936
I told you not to call me that

01:23:07.812 --> 01:23:10.829
Then Mr Kim Jong-won, regardless of who you are

01:23:11.315 --> 01:23:13.317
I want to do what I want

01:23:13.317 --> 01:23:14.338
Don't you get it?

01:23:16.028 --> 01:23:20.366
You have got to where you are
because of my son and wife assistance.

01:23:21.075 --> 01:23:26.247
Quit the competition now.

01:23:26.247 --> 01:23:27.293
Quit the competition now?

01:23:32.294 --> 01:23:34.630
I will continue the competition till the end

01:23:34.714 --> 01:23:37.341
To me, my Dad does not exist any more

01:23:37.383 --> 01:23:41.929
When the competition ends,
I will tell you what I know

01:23:56.193 --> 01:23:58.738
How is it?

01:24:00.865 --> 01:24:02.032
(**)

01:24:19.049 --> 01:24:23.387
It's a joke right? Where do I find a girl that
fits such expensive dress

01:24:25.089 --> 01:24:27.758
(**)

01:24:30.269 --> 01:24:31.896
What's wrong with the dress

01:24:37.318 --> 01:24:38.652
It's beautiful

01:24:42.239 --> 01:24:46.744
The dress is just a dress.
You must have chemistry with the girl instead

01:24:47.912 --> 01:24:49.933
Have some sense, you idiot.

01:24:58.464 --> 01:25:03.636
-What?
-(**Hug me or grab my hand)

01:25:15.689 --> 01:25:17.756
How is it? Do you feel anything?

01:25:38.754 --> 01:25:40.798
The Top 4 for Fashion King 3

01:25:40.839 --> 01:25:44.301
New mission start!

01:25:46.762 --> 01:25:47.833
Fabien contestant

01:25:48.764 --> 01:25:54.353
The apron Fabien wore matches well with
the dress

01:25:54.478 --> 01:25:55.312
Italian famous food is foie gras

01:25:55.354 --> 01:25:57.523
-Or is it carviar?
-He is opening it!

01:25:57.523 --> 01:25:59.275
France famous food is...

01:25:59.566 --> 01:26:01.735
Oh? Cheonggukjang (Fermented soybean paste)

01:26:02.319 --> 01:26:03.862
Fabien out!

01:26:06.281 --> 01:26:10.244
Oh they are in the forest.
Such good choice

01:26:10.285 --> 01:26:13.080
I decided to keep my heart to myself

01:26:13.497 --> 01:26:15.249
(**)

01:26:16.125 --> 01:26:17.876
Let's go up together (for healing)

01:26:23.465 --> 01:26:27.177
Wearing high heels is not healing but killing

01:26:27.261 --> 01:26:29.138
Get out!

01:26:30.931 --> 01:26:37.604
Won-ho style matches well with her dress

01:26:37.771 --> 01:26:39.982
They look like a great couple

01:26:41.692 --> 01:26:44.361
Diamond! Diamond!

01:26:44.445 --> 01:26:45.654
Kim Won-ho I love you!

01:26:45.654 --> 01:26:48.115
Please hold on...

01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:51.827
She looks very blissful

01:26:51.869 --> 01:26:52.965
With a smile on her face

01:26:54.163 --> 01:26:56.707
(**Something about everyone will smile
with a diamond beside them)

01:26:56.707 --> 01:26:59.001
Limousine

01:26:59.626 --> 01:27:03.255
As expected after the wedding,
there will be a Limousine

01:27:04.465 --> 01:27:05.758
What is this?

01:27:12.055 --> 01:27:13.849
Hello Hye-jin, it's me

01:27:13.891 --> 01:27:17.227
-Ki-myung fashion!
-Hye-jin face!

01:27:17.352 --> 01:27:19.646
I don't know what to say

01:27:19.073 --> 01:27:20.950
Is he originally so handsome?

01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:23.692
Didn't you do it?

01:27:25.778 --> 01:27:30.324
I have been treasuring the days
since I met you

01:27:30.949 --> 01:27:33.911
It's as if I learnt what love is

01:27:34.286 --> 01:27:36.955
Don't forget the happy days that we had together

01:27:36.997 --> 01:27:42.503
Let's be happy in future
I love you

01:27:45.756 --> 01:27:48.550
He took his jacket off for her

01:27:48.592 --> 01:27:49.551
He has sense!

01:27:49.593 --> 01:27:51.678
(**)

01:27:51.072 --> 01:27:52.907
Oh, he put on a hat.

01:27:54.306 --> 01:27:55.974
The scissors..

01:27:57.768 --> 01:28:01.230
The dress became mini one-piece dress.
Such sense!

01:28:02.814 --> 01:28:05.400
Who is the Top 2

01:28:05.484 --> 01:28:07.986
That manages to attract Hye-jin heart?

01:28:23.794 --> 01:28:25.712
We have come so far

01:28:27.673 --> 01:28:28.769
You are amazing, Woo Ki-myung

01:28:32.511 --> 01:28:33.929
Do you hate me that much?

01:28:34.096 --> 01:28:37.975
I should ask you this instead.
What do you want?

01:28:40.031 --> 01:28:43.326
This is what I want to do

01:28:43.772 --> 01:28:45.864
Is that so?
Then I will be straight-forward

01:28:47.943 --> 01:28:50.237
How much money do you want?
I will give it to you

01:28:52.572 --> 01:28:54.366
And you quit the finals

01:28:58.912 --> 01:29:00.539
That means I will have to lose

01:29:02.291 --> 01:29:07.337
Won-ho ah, are you bribing(?) me?

01:29:07.379 --> 01:29:10.048
Bribing? Of course not

01:29:10.924 --> 01:29:15.178
I'm just letting you know.
Don't make me the bad guy

01:29:15.637 --> 01:29:19.599
Everyone around you will get in trouble

01:29:22.894 --> 01:29:28.903
-Ki-myung, Won-ho.
-Sorry I am late

01:29:30.235 --> 01:29:32.571
You guys are great

01:29:33.003 --> 01:29:34.879
The program rating has hit the roof!

01:29:36.575 --> 01:29:37.909
The final mission is

01:29:37.993 --> 01:29:40.495
The only precious thing in my life

01:29:40.537 --> 01:29:42.831
Mission exchange

01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:45.667
Mission exchange, fighting!

01:29:46.334 --> 01:29:49.588
Ki-myung, let's meet in the finals.
Fighting!

01:29:49.921 --> 01:29:52.007
Very good! Very good!

01:30:46.353 --> 01:30:49.022
Thank you

01:30:49.094 --> 01:30:50.512
Fill it up, quick

01:30:51.691 --> 01:30:52.567
All of this?

01:30:54.152 --> 01:30:55.946
It only cost 10000 won

01:31:00.007 --> 01:31:02.385
-Why?
-No, It looks weird

01:31:10.071 --> 01:31:11.948
Aigoo, my son ate really well

01:31:14.005 --> 01:31:15.674
Why are you so happy?

01:31:16.007 --> 01:31:19.469
I have a present for you

01:31:19.469 --> 01:31:20.345
What is it?

01:31:20.554 --> 01:31:23.056
The thing I really want you to have

01:31:23.056 --> 01:31:24.057
What is it?

01:31:24.307 --> 01:31:25.353
Just wait awhile

01:31:28.077 --> 01:31:30.329
Come, have some fruits

01:31:49.249 --> 01:31:52.544
Take off your shirt

01:32:16.818 --> 01:32:19.362
You are my son and I
don't know anything

01:32:20.078 --> 01:32:21.747
All I can say is "don't give up"

01:32:23.616 --> 01:32:26.288
"Give it your best" these kind of words

01:32:26.288 --> 01:32:30.540
But I did not know you are suffering like this.
Our Ki-myung is so poor thing

01:32:37.756 --> 01:32:40.467
Ki-myung ah, let's stop here

01:32:41.009 --> 01:32:42.802
It's enough

01:32:44.679 --> 01:32:45.930
Mom, you think this is scary?

01:32:48.391 --> 01:32:55.190
-I'm not a tiny bit afraid
-Mom is afraid! I'm afraid you get injured! So let's stop here

01:32:55.019 --> 01:32:58.111
It's because of incidents like these
that makes us move house frequently.

01:32:59.611 --> 01:33:02.739
How can I see my son hurt?

01:33:03.073 --> 01:33:04.741
I beg you

01:33:05.742 --> 01:33:07.763
I've been hiding all my life

01:33:09.454 --> 01:33:11.247
Where can I run to?

01:33:11.956 --> 01:33:15.752
Tomorrow, will be the day I reborn

01:33:16.169 --> 01:33:18.088
It's the most proper day of my life

01:33:20.006 --> 01:33:21.424
Please believe me

01:33:22.258 --> 01:33:29.182
No, don't go! I beg you
I don't like my child to be hurt

01:33:29.182 --> 01:33:30.850
I can't!

01:34:17.063 --> 01:34:18.314
Woah, Woo Ki-myung

01:34:20.942 --> 01:34:21.943
You are awake?

01:34:24.153 --> 01:34:25.905
Do you remember this?

01:34:26.322 --> 01:34:27.156
What is it?

01:34:30.785 --> 01:34:32.036
We look so nerd right?

01:34:33.037 --> 01:34:34.038
Right

01:34:35.248 --> 01:34:37.083
We look alike

01:34:37.959 --> 01:34:39.085
What is it?

01:34:39.836 --> 01:34:42.797
The day you shifted into the same block as me

01:34:43.756 --> 01:34:46.134
I can't believe there is someone
that look like me in this world

01:34:46.134 --> 01:34:47.205
I'm so happy

01:34:48.511 --> 01:34:51.306
But I'm not sure why I feel weird

01:34:51.306 --> 01:34:53.308
Feels weird

01:34:53.558 --> 01:34:55.560
(**)

01:34:56.978 --> 01:34:59.522
But this is how the real Ki-myung looks like

01:35:00.648 --> 01:35:01.774
You look good

01:35:05.111 --> 01:35:07.195
-Eun-jin ah
-Huh?

01:35:08.656 --> 01:35:09.824
Honestly...

01:35:16.706 --> 01:35:22.003
I really am thankful to

01:35:23.063 --> 01:35:25.565
Nam-jung, Chang-joo and you

01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:02.418
Where is Ki-myung?

01:36:05.671 --> 01:36:07.423
Come, let me take a look

01:36:08.049 --> 01:36:10.093
Make up, OK!

01:36:11.344 --> 01:36:12.261
Where is Ki-myung?

01:36:13.221 --> 01:36:14.680
He's not here yet

01:36:15.139 --> 01:36:17.475
What is he doing?
Why aren't you calling him?!

01:36:17.475 --> 01:36:18.184
Quick!

01:37:18.327 --> 01:37:19.373
That bad woman

01:37:24.834 --> 01:37:26.127
You bad guy

01:37:27.503 --> 01:37:30.298
-Me? Why?
-Don't you like money?

01:37:31.257 --> 01:37:32.884
She's just being realistic

01:37:33.551 --> 01:37:35.344
That's why we have to earn a lot of money

01:37:36.637 --> 01:37:38.139
Work hard kid

01:37:49.817 --> 01:37:54.238
-We have waited too long
-Song PD, what is happening?

01:37:54.238 --> 01:37:55.281
Just wait a little while more

01:37:55.099 --> 01:38:00.813
-How is it?
-He just would not pick up the phone

01:38:01.704 --> 01:38:02.997
-Shouldn't you contact beforehand?
-Call him again!

01:38:06.167 --> 01:38:07.238
What's wrong? He's not coming?

01:38:07.877 --> 01:38:09.420
What to do?

01:38:09.879 --> 01:38:10.755
-Hello everyone
-Won-ho ah

01:38:14.467 --> 01:38:16.761
You get on stage first

01:38:16.761 --> 01:38:18.387
Let's do this first

01:38:21.724 --> 01:38:22.892
Style No. 1

01:38:22.892 --> 01:38:24.393
Fashion King audience

01:38:24.602 --> 01:38:26.103
You have waited long

01:38:26.354 --> 01:38:30.066
The finals are finally here

01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:55.052
-For the start, we will present to you Kim Won-ho
-Kim Won-ho has gotten the mission from Woo Ki-myung, school uniform

01:38:55.097 --> 01:38:59.097
-Aunt, why isn't he coming?
-Is Ki-myung there? He did not pick up my call
-For the start, we will present to you Kim Won-ho
-Kim Won-ho has gotten the mission from Woo Ki-myung, school uniform

01:38:59.097 --> 01:39:01.892
-Aunt, why isn't he coming?
-Is Ki-myung there? He did not pick up my call

01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:04.279
Eun-jin ah, Ki-myung he...

01:39:04.379 --> 01:39:09.814
How does an ordinary school uniform look
in Won-ho hands, let's take a look

01:39:11.482 --> 01:39:13.574
Finally, the lights are dimming

01:39:14.402 --> 01:39:17.863
-Top 2 is coming out
-Right

01:39:18.823 --> 01:39:26.789
Kim Won-ho being welcomed by the
loud applause of the audience

01:39:26.789 --> 01:39:28.791
-The other entrance is empty
-Shouldn't Ki-myung be standing there?

01:39:29.875 --> 01:39:36.674
-Woo Ki-myung is not here
-What is happening

01:39:36.674 --> 01:39:40.970
-If he's not here, it means he is giving up
-Did he give up?

01:39:54.775 --> 01:39:56.443
He's walking down the stairs

01:39:57.361 --> 01:40:01.740
It's great!

01:40:01.074 --> 01:40:03.577
-As expected, that pose
-The outfit that is being modified using a school uniform

01:40:10.666 --> 01:40:17.133
-Woo Ki-myung gave him the school uniform right?
-With his additional modification to it

01:40:17.133 --> 01:40:21.302
He is not picking up the phone

01:40:39.236 --> 01:40:41.113
What is that?

01:40:43.157 --> 01:40:48.329
-No one can win that. That is really the focus.
-That's right

01:40:48.329 --> 01:40:52.333
He even gave such nice fan service to the fans

01:41:00.633 --> 01:41:02.426
Yes, alright

01:41:07.598 --> 01:41:15.940
It really looks good, the style

01:41:15.094 --> 01:41:17.888
-Ya, isn't that Woo Ki-myung? He looks injured
-We have to inform the PD quick!

01:41:31.058 --> 01:41:33.477
Ki-myung ah, what happened?

01:41:34.124 --> 01:41:35.751
What happened, Ki-myung ah?

01:41:39.421 --> 01:41:40.506
Don't cry

01:41:41.965 --> 01:41:48.024
-Let's go to the hospital first. You can't be like this
-Eun-jin ah, it's okay

01:41:48.555 --> 01:41:50.474
Why didn't you tell me

01:41:52.142 --> 01:41:54.269
Why are you so stupid?

01:41:54.395 --> 01:41:55.688
It's okay

01:41:56.023 --> 01:41:57.191
You stupid

01:42:08.659 --> 01:42:13.205
-Song PD, Ki-myung is here but his condition is really bad
-Huh?

01:42:14.079 --> 01:42:16.498
Now please direct the camera to the backstage
Quickly!

01:42:17.543 --> 01:42:22.798
Great, this is becoming a drama

01:42:22.798 --> 01:42:25.884
Navy style uniform. Woo Ki-myung gave you
school uniform mission right?

01:42:26.343 --> 01:42:32.641
Why is this unique to Kim Won-ho?

01:42:32.641 --> 01:42:34.893
Does it have any special meaning?

01:42:40.399 --> 01:42:42.693
It was worn by my late father

01:42:42.943 --> 01:42:44.528
My father is a navy officer

01:42:45.112 --> 01:42:48.323
I want to show my dad how grown up

01:42:48.657 --> 01:42:50.951
I was on the stage

01:42:53.871 --> 01:42:57.458
I believe my dad in the heaven is watching this

01:42:58.208 --> 01:42:59.460
If I win

01:43:00.794 --> 01:43:02.421
I will loudly...

01:43:03.672 --> 01:43:04.743
I want loudly say his name out

01:43:12.764 --> 01:43:13.765
Woo Ki-myung

01:43:14.391 --> 01:43:16.268
Sorry, please make way

01:43:17.269 --> 01:43:20.230
Ki-myung ah, you...

01:43:20.023 --> 01:43:20.691
Mom...

01:43:23.734 --> 01:43:27.070
Ki-myung ah, what is wrong?

01:43:28.003 --> 01:43:29.171
What happened to you?

01:43:29.198 --> 01:43:31.200
Who did this? Who is it?

01:43:31.992 --> 01:43:33.619
What did mom said?

01:43:33.994 --> 01:43:42.170
-That is why mom want you to stop everything
-Mom, I'm alright

01:43:42.017 --> 01:43:44.063
-Let's go to the hospital
-No mom

01:43:45.589 --> 01:43:46.632
I'm not going to the hospital

01:43:58.769 --> 01:43:59.686
Sorry

01:44:01.098 --> 01:44:02.144
I wanted to protect this

01:44:05.108 --> 01:44:06.735
I tried to protect it

01:44:06.086 --> 01:44:09.131
Woo Ki-myung, are you crazy?

01:44:11.615 --> 01:44:13.636
How can you join the competition
when you are like this?

01:44:15.285 --> 01:44:16.703
Help me, Chang-joo...

01:44:21.583 --> 01:44:23.627
The camera is filming now

01:44:24.461 --> 01:44:26.713
Aren't you going to wear it?

01:44:27.339 --> 01:44:27.756
-Do you want to see everyone bored to death?
-Do it

01:44:29.216 --> 01:44:30.300
There's no more time

01:44:30.003 --> 01:44:32.005
I said do it!

01:44:34.179 --> 01:44:37.307
Woo Ki-myung, I told you before

01:44:38.976 --> 01:44:43.772
Classiness is a weapon no one can win it

01:44:45.148 --> 01:44:49.194
The current moment is an example

01:44:49.861 --> 01:44:51.238
(**Something like asking Ki-myung to enjoy the moment)

01:44:57.327 --> 01:44:58.912
Eun-jin ah, give me your necklace

01:45:33.864 --> 01:45:34.573
Go on

01:45:52.424 --> 01:45:55.677
-Woo Ki-myung is waiting to enter now
-What did you say? I thought he wasn't coming?

01:45:55.677 --> 01:45:58.180
Won-ho, please stand in the middle of the stage

01:46:03.768 --> 01:46:05.860
Up next, is fashion king

01:46:07.063 --> 01:46:09.941
Woo Ki-myung will be showcasing his fashion show

01:46:12.011 --> 01:46:16.474
Woo Ki-myung will be walking below the stage

01:47:02.744 --> 01:47:05.830
Hello Won-ho

01:47:14.214 --> 01:47:17.676
I've not spend your money yet

01:47:18.051 --> 01:47:19.052
Thanks to you

01:47:24.266 --> 01:47:26.059
Isn't there a convenience store in front?

01:47:26.309 --> 01:47:27.978
Go buy a bread there

01:47:29.396 --> 01:47:30.563
Although I'm sorry

01:47:31.815 --> 01:47:33.984
Please buy one for me too when you are back

01:47:46.079 --> 01:47:49.040
Kim Won-ho, please return to your place

01:48:03.722 --> 01:48:04.681
Useless guy

01:48:29.914 --> 01:48:37.672
-Even though something unpredictable happened, he did not give up
-Please give him an applause

01:48:54.481 --> 01:48:55.690
You are cool, Woo Ki-myung

01:49:27.889 --> 01:49:32.894
Now, we will proceed with the next
fashion king, Woo Ki-myung

01:49:35.188 --> 01:49:37.899
Woo Ki-myung, please come up to the stage

01:49:39.984 --> 01:49:42.445
Ki-myung ah, go put on a good show

01:49:43.196 --> 01:49:43.821
Go!

01:49:46.491 --> 01:49:51.037
While Woo Ki-myung is coming up the stage,
we will be chosing the final winner

01:50:10.039 --> 01:50:13.042
Ki-myung ah! Bang bang

01:50:14.227 --> 01:50:15.812
There are nothing in the world
that last forever

01:50:16.521 --> 01:50:17.592
Clouds.. trees...

01:50:18.094 --> 01:50:20.179
and even human will disappear one day

01:50:23.987 --> 01:50:24.988
That's why I

01:50:25.613 --> 01:50:27.699
Will never give up this moment

01:50:28.658 --> 01:50:31.494
Because I am currently alive

01:50:34.008 --> 01:50:36.052
I am not the old Woo Ki-myung anymore

01:50:36.291 --> 01:50:39.210
-The final winner of Fashion King is-

01:50:39.585 --> 01:50:42.630
I am Woo Ki-myung
