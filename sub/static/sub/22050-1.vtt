WEBVTT

00:55.000 --> 00:56.780
I spotted them on Friday.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.560
This is good shit. Fuck!

00:59.560 --> 01:03.100
Both her and Emilie are so hot.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.500
No..

01:06.780 --> 01:08.600
She isn't doable.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.120
Huh?!

01:10.120 --> 01:11.780
What do you think?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.380
I think that she's doable.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.120
Yeah?
-Emilie as well.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.360
Emilie is even better.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.520
What's up with you guys, lowering you standards.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.080
What's up with you?

01:23.140 --> 01:27.620
What are you talking about standards?
You should be much less picky, considering how ugly you are.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.680
Is there not a single hot girl? Not one?

01:35.540 --> 01:38.900
I could've gotten with all the first years.
-There is one!

01:39.020 --> 01:40.860
Listen to me. One!

01:41.860 --> 01:45.240
Short, dark hair. Don't know
what she's called. But she's hot.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.920
She's pretty. I saw her.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.120
The one resembling Natalie Portman?
-Yes, yes, yes. That one.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.740
I don't think you have a chance.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.560
Not in this life, maybe the next one.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.980
I do have a chance!

02:00.020 --> 02:09.680
Last guy she was with was a 20-year-old model.
He was tall and dark. You are neither.

02:09.740 --> 02:11.380
Why should I care about that?

02:11.380 --> 02:14.780
Because then you know where her standards lie.

02:16.020 --> 02:22.260
When a girl dates a 20-year-old model,
she won't date another guy like that.

02:22.260 --> 02:23.540
I have a chance.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.080
You have to take the stash.
-No!

02:29.080 --> 02:33.700
I'm too stressed when I have it.
Take it yourself.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.860
I can't have it with me.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.460
Then I'll take it. Jesus Christ!

02:42.460 --> 02:43.780
It isn't yours!

02:43.860 --> 02:47.540
Just let him take it.
-I don't even know him!

02:48.420 --> 02:51.480
Don't know me? What are you talking about?
-It's 1000 kroner!

02:51.480 --> 02:54.360
You know.. What the fuck?
You're sitting here smoking it with him.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.980
Of course you know him!

02:55.980 --> 02:59.780
He's in, I'm in, he's in..

02:59.780 --> 03:04.900
Him.. I don't know what he's doing.
Just let him take it. I'm really certain.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.140
Thanks.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.740
What would you do without me?

03:12.080 --> 03:14.880
What's going on? Shut the door.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.940
I need to pee.
-Then shut the door right now.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.220
Hello?!

03:23.220 --> 03:26.000
Don't just leave.
I was stuck there with that nerd.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.320
I had to pee.

03:28.580 --> 03:32.080
Your girl.
-It's so boring here.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.720
Hello.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.940
Remember when we were at Sana's place and took some pills?

03:47.240 --> 03:49.560
She was so out of it.
-They weren't blue.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.140
I think they're the same.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.720
Do you know who you look like?

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Yes.

04:00.260 --> 04:03.220
The little boy in Stranger Things.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.220
You know! The little boy
who's actually a girl. Eleven.

04:13.140 --> 04:14.780
So damn rude.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.860
No!

04:16.040 --> 04:20.160
She's sweet.
If you're into 13-year-old boys.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.020
Huh? What?
-I'm only kidding!

04:29.120 --> 04:33.280
Seriously. I'm only kidding. I'm sorry.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.360
My name's Isak. What's yours?
-Emma.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.360
Emma? You're really beautiful.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.800
We're leaving.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.060
Do you know how this works?

04:47.060 --> 04:48.400
Let me see.

04:51.700 --> 04:54.300
Zyrtec? Those are allergy pills.

04:54.300 --> 04:57.160
They'll make you tired.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.280
Do you want something that works?
-Do you have that?

05:01.880 --> 05:03.060
Maybe.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.440
I'm leaving.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.600
Uh yeah. We'll check if there's some food around here.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.300
Really nice, Isak.

05:41.960 --> 05:45.780
Hey...
-Hey, what?

06:04.660 --> 06:06.460
Emma, Yousef is here.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.420
Have you seen Eva?
-No.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.060
Hi.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.540
Where are you going?
-Home.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.400
You're going home? Over the fence?
-Yeah.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.020
All the others have gone through the gate over there.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.280
Do you have some ID on you?
With your name etc.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.220
Bank card? Driver's license?

07:59.560 --> 08:01.980
No.
-Nothing?

08:02.300 --> 08:05.780
What's your name?
-Adrian Eksett.

08:05.780 --> 08:09.760
Adrian. How old are you?
Wait a minute.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.000
Yes? Answer.

08:53.180 --> 08:59.700
<i>[Text from his mom with a Bible verse.]</i>

09:02.340 --> 09:05.320
<i>[Do you still have our stash? Call me when you wake up. Police found
some stuff at Eva's place. She's really mad and thinks it's mine.]</i>

09:19.640 --> 09:30.720
<i>[Pick up your phone then. Sorry I had to hide it at Eva's.
But it's not possible that they found that because I hid it really well.]</i>

09:30.800 --> 09:35.820
<i>[Promise I'll fix it. Call me.]</i>

09:36.300 --> 09:40.320
Isak! Hey, he's awake.
With morning wood straight up.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.820
Look! Devil's cave is what I call it.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.360
Want to say hi?
Hi, good morning!

09:47.680 --> 09:48.860
Did you sleep well?

09:49.300 --> 09:50.180
Say hi.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.080
Hi.
-Say hi then!

09:52.080 --> 09:53.180
Hi!

09:53.880 --> 09:55.480
He's a bit crabby and tired.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.000
Hi Isak!
-Hi. Hi, Noora.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.200
Piss off, Eskild!
-Relax!

10:03.360 --> 10:08.000
What are you guys doing today?
-Relax, I think.

10:09.420 --> 10:11.720
Yeah. Relax.
So nice.

10:12.020 --> 10:17.900
I'm going to sell my Warhammer collection
on the flea market. No, I'm kidding.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.680
I'm going to the supermarket to buy fish cakes. Kidding.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.900
I'm going to fill up a big can with
Fun Light and watch a movie. With Linn.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.880
Ah, so nice.
-Yeah.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.180
We'll snuggle up together.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.760
What are you going to do?

10:39.000 --> 10:45.600
I don't know. I'll just find something.

10:46.660 --> 10:47.960
Something like what?

10:47.960 --> 10:53.940
William's working, so I just have to…
I don't have that many friends yet.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.260
What I think, Noora..
You are in London. Best city in the world.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.360
I know! I'm having a lot fun!

11:05.760 --> 11:10.400
I'll have lots of fun today.
Or I'll go to a museum.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.580
You're going to a museum?
-Yeah!

11:13.780 --> 11:20.660
Don't go to a museum, Noora. Do something fun!
Don't go to a museum and be boring. Do something fun.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.900
Go to a club. Get some drinks.
-Yeah, relax.

11:28.940 --> 11:31.800
I'm having lots of fun.
-Yeah..

11:33.220 --> 11:36.940
I want you to be doing well, Noora.
-Yeah, really well!

11:39.420 --> 11:42.880
So what's it like living with Isak?
Is it all right?

11:43.940 --> 11:47.200
He doesn't pay rent, you know?
-I will pay.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.940
And he smells like farts. Guy farts.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.100
While you smell good.
You smell like delicious lavender.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.620
Love you.

11:59.980 --> 12:05.960
… I hooked up with a girl of who I legitimately thought had a cat tongue.

12:05.960 --> 12:10.220
I'm not sure if it was a tongue, or a fake tongue.

12:10.220 --> 12:12.040
Fake tongue?!

12:12.900 --> 12:16.920
Like making out with a cat.
-Have you kissed a cat?

12:16.960 --> 12:20.180
No, but it was really small and thin.
-Cat size?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.840
I didn't see her tongue, but...

12:24.840 --> 12:29.500
You know that party at Johanna's?

12:30.240 --> 12:32.380
I hooked up with a chick there.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.580
The blonde one?
-Yeah, the blonde one.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.340
She didn't have a clitoris.

12:38.060 --> 12:41.220
What?!
-Yeah, I swear. She didn't have it.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.140
How do you know?
-I saw it.

12:47.740 --> 12:52.240
<i>[Dad: Hi Isak. Do you want to have dinner with
me on Wednesday night? Hug from dad/]</i>

12:52.280 --> 12:57.440
I saw it! I know where the clitoris is.
And I saw it when I went down on her.

12:57.440 --> 12:57.880
<i>[I need money for my rent. 4000 kroner]</i>

12:57.880 --> 12:59.360
Are you joking?
<i>[I need money for my rent. 4000 kroner]</i>

12:59.360 --> 12:59.480
<i>[I need money for my rent. 4000 kroner]</i>

12:59.600 --> 13:01.400
No..
-You went down on her?

13:01.400 --> 13:03.400
Yeah.
-You go down on chicks?

13:03.820 --> 13:06.160
Why are you so surprised? You don't?

13:06.640 --> 13:09.620
Eh, no!
-Why not?

13:10.300 --> 13:14.560
I don't know. Should we go down on chicks?

13:15.520 --> 13:16.560
Why the fuck..

13:17.160 --> 13:22.260
Because they love it. Why do you ask?
-Do you also go down on chicks?

13:22.460 --> 13:23.280
Isak?

13:23.440 --> 13:24.520
Hi!

13:25.960 --> 13:29.300
Do you guys perhaps want to join the theatre this year?

13:31.960 --> 13:33.140
Don't really know.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.860
We are group leaders of the “kose” group. <i>(can't translate kose to English. The word describes a good vibe/feeling/atmosphere)</i>

13:35.860 --> 13:37.600
We want to have you guys!

13:38.240 --> 13:40.480
<i>Kose</i> group? What does a <i>kose</i> group do?

13:40.480 --> 13:44.680
We make sure there's a good atmosphere.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.960
We spread love, bake bread, we cook.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.540
We have a group meeting next Friday.
Maybe you guys want to come?

13:53.320 --> 13:54.940
Friday..?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.940
No. I don't really know. It's Friday, you know.

14:03.660 --> 14:08.480
But you're second years.
You're neither third years nor first years.

14:08.940 --> 14:14.700
You guys should make yourselves known
socially to avoid becoming completely anonymous.

14:15.140 --> 14:18.780
Do you guys want that?
To walk around being a nobody?

14:22.880 --> 14:23.620
Eva!

14:25.340 --> 14:29.040
Did you see my messages?
I forgot my sweater at your place.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.920
Yeah, I saw. I'll look for it.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.860
No, but I have to come get it
at your place because I know what it looks like.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.660
Can't you just describe it?

14:41.900 --> 14:43.240
Yes. I can.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.360
It's black…

14:51.700 --> 14:56.500
Okay… A black sweater. Got it.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.180
Let us know if you want to join!

15:03.380 --> 15:05.300
Yeah, we'll do that.

15:06.540 --> 15:07.440
Bye.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.080
A sweater?!

15:14.800 --> 15:16.000
What's up?

15:19.480 --> 15:23.700
I had to hide the shit at Eva's place.
-Are you kidding?

15:26.140 --> 15:28.660
I'll fix it.
-That's 1000 kroner.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.660
Mahdi, I'll fix it.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.200
Was it not good?

15:40.820 --> 15:42.040
<i>(bread pun)</i>

15:43.380 --> 15:46.300
Ask first. Cat guy.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.680
<i>(continuation of the bread pun)</i>

16:11.300 --> 16:13.840
Hi.
-Hi.

16:19.760 --> 16:25.280
I have your drugs.
-What?

16:26.460 --> 16:28.880
The stuff you left at Eva's place.

16:30.060 --> 16:31.180
I have it.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.240
You have it?

16:37.480 --> 16:42.560
If there's one thing I don't like,
it's when someone fucks over their friends.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.660
What do you mean?

16:46.220 --> 16:49.880
Eva could've been in a
lot of trouble if they had found it.

16:52.180 --> 16:54.900
Could have.. but they didn't find it.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.620
They didn't find it because I took it.

17:00.560 --> 17:07.380
Okay, I'm sorry for leaving it there.
Thanks for taking it, but it's not even mine.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.980
I should get something in
return for rescuing it from the police.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.440
Do you think this is a fucking
Narcos episode or something?

17:16.360 --> 17:17.680
Can't you just give it to me?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.160
I want 10% of your drugs.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.900
Do you use it then?

17:25.260 --> 17:28.120
No, but it's great to have.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.620
I also want you and your
friends to join the <i>kose </i>group.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.700
<i>Kose</i> group. That's the best theatre group of them all!

17:45.980 --> 17:46.980
Okay.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.520
Whatever. We can join the <i>kose</i> group.

17:51.620 --> 17:54.020
So then you'll give it to me?
-Yes.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.620
So just give it to me now.

17:57.340 --> 18:02.440
Do you think I'm dumb? You get it
when I see you and your friends at the group meeting.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.540
Sana and Isak can work together.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.120
Huh?! No, I'm not sitting here.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.900
Can't you work with Isak? It'll be fine.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.040
Guys and girls can work together.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.020
We do that in Norway.

18:32.860 --> 18:34.940
Hi! Welcome!

18:41.060 --> 18:44.880
<i>[Where the fuck are you guys? I can't be
bothered to sit here by myself, it's your shit.]</i>

18:44.880 --> 18:44.960
Chris!
<i>[Where the fuck are you guys? I can't be
bothered to sit here by myself, it's your shit.]</i>

18:44.960 --> 18:45.720
Chris!

18:54.620 --> 18:57.140
Can Kasper join the meeting?

18:57.840 --> 19:01.340
Kasper doesn't go to this school though.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.680
Yes. That'll be fine.
Right Vilde?

19:11.000 --> 19:15.060
It's quite unhealthy that
they're together every single second.

19:15.140 --> 19:17.640
Hello.
-Hi!

19:18.040 --> 19:20.560
So nice that you wanted to come.

19:21.040 --> 19:25.780
Yeah just find a seat,
then we can start.

19:25.840 --> 19:30.040
Some bread? I baked it myself.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.240
Cool. Looking forward to it.

19:36.700 --> 19:44.000
<i>[Sorry man, I have to help my mom
with something. I'll come as soon as I'm done.]</i>

19:44.020 --> 19:47.040
<i>[Fuck was that today]</i>

19:47.240 --> 19:49.240
Hello.
-Hello.

19:49.240 --> 19:53.260
<i>Kose</i> group, yay!
-Yay...

19:53.900 --> 20:00.360
We looked at the group list during break.
Where are the awesome people of this school?

20:02.780 --> 20:05.320
<i>Kose</i> group, of course.

20:08.740 --> 20:09.580
Cool.

20:09.660 --> 20:12.680
Hi and feel welcome.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.700
We are overjoyed that you
guys are here today.

20:17.700 --> 20:21.240
You guys can introduce yourselves.
This here is...

20:21.300 --> 20:23.620
Eva.
-Sana.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.720
Vilde!
-Vilde.

20:26.900 --> 20:30.780
So I thought I'd explain
what kind of vision we have.

20:30.880 --> 20:39.980
We have our group meeting 3 weeks before
the others because we are an important aspect of the theatre.

20:40.020 --> 20:42.620
More than for example PR or costumes.

20:43.980 --> 20:50.140
We thought it's best to have
a good system throughout the entire theatre event.

20:50.180 --> 20:53.920
That's why we'll divide you into groups.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.720
Or duos, so that you'll be in pairs.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.080
Then it's not a group, but a duo.

21:01.360 --> 21:09.020
You guys will divide the days between yourselves.
That's what we'll be doing.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.620
So that... I'm a bit nervous!

21:13.940 --> 21:20.160
So that you will pair up and
someone will cook every day.

21:20.460 --> 21:29.860
It's really important in the <i>kose</i> group that
you spread a lot of good vibes, and love.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.860
Spreading love is not something
that comes naturally to everyone.

21:34.020 --> 21:39.780
So I thought we could all do a love exercise.
If everyone can get up...

21:44.460 --> 21:48.700
If everyone can stand in a circle here,
then we'll grab each other's hands.

23:02.660 --> 23:04.400
Do you also need tissues?

23:25.640 --> 23:26.800
Come outside.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.200
You know the group leader?

24:06.540 --> 24:07.640
Vilde?

24:08.920 --> 24:13.040
With the love game?
-What was that?

24:16.420 --> 24:19.780
I had to bail. I can't be bothered
with that stuff. What happened?

24:20.520 --> 24:27.920
She got us to go and feel each in a dark room.
If you walked into a dick, you had to suck it.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.820
No?
-No!

24:56.800 --> 25:00.080
What class are you in?
-3STB

25:02.180 --> 25:03.880
You didn't go here before?

25:05.140 --> 25:06.560
No, Bakka (Elvebakken).

25:07.880 --> 25:10.320
You transferred in your final year?

25:10.320 --> 25:11.220
Hey you.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.460
Hey.
-Hi.

25:14.540 --> 25:18.460
We're setting up the cooking system.
We should be in pairs.

25:18.720 --> 25:25.000
I don't know that many people.
Well I know Maria, but she's going with Lea.

25:25.380 --> 25:29.800
So that's why I was wondering
if you want to be in a group with me.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.260
I thought we were in a group together.

25:35.780 --> 25:40.360
Yeah, I had in a way already
agreed to be in a group with...

25:42.020 --> 25:44.200
With...
-Even.

25:44.580 --> 25:45.620
Emma.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.760
I'm sure we can be with three.

25:51.680 --> 25:55.400
I think she said we should
be in pairs, but I don't care.

25:55.740 --> 25:59.860
It seemed like Vilde was
really clear on wanting pairs.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.220
Can't you just ask?

26:04.260 --> 26:07.400
Yeah, okay. Then we'll do that.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.760
Yes, we'll do that.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.340
Can I have a drag?

26:23.260 --> 26:24.120
Thanks.
