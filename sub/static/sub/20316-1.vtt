other than being born.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.920
-So, yeah, it's pretty big.
-[director] Are you a Christian?

01:38.960 --> 01:43.240
I'm not technically christened,
but I'm a very spiritual person.

01:43.280 --> 01:46.040
And I think I have
Christian morals.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.640
Like, I love Christmas,
for example.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.400
I love everything about
Christmas - getting presents,
eating loads of food,

01:52.440 --> 01:55.600
so I think I do believe
in God in that way, yeah.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.320
Miche! Do you know
where my Avirex is?

01:59.360 --> 02:02.000
You've... Miche, there's
glitter all over it.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.680
Oh, sorry. I've been
doing T-shirt designs.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.880
It's hectic,
it gets everywhere.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.560
They should have more
christening emoticons,
shouldn't they?

02:09.600 --> 02:12.640
What I've done is like a baby's
head with some water splashes

02:12.680 --> 02:14.640
and then a church.
Like, what else?

02:14.680 --> 02:17.360
I dunno. Just, like,
smiley face or...

02:17.400 --> 02:20.000
-A gun?
-Why a gun?

-Love that.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.640
See ya later.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.240
Basically, yeah, when
you get christianed,

02:26.280 --> 02:28.480
-you need a godfather.
-Godfather.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.440
So it's a very important
decision I have to make.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.720
And it's going to be someone
who's very close to me...

02:33.760 --> 02:36.040
-Yeah.
-..and someone who's loyal.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.600
It's out of Decoy and Beats.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.280
But...

02:40.320 --> 02:43.160
I thought it was
going to be me.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.080
Well, we'll see.
Whoever's the most
deserving out of them two.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.360

in the running.
-Yeah, but...

to the finals.

[director] And what
are you doing here?

03:07.600 --> 03:10.280
So these are designs for
Angel's christening T-shirt.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.920
It's so everyone can have a
sort of memento from the day.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.560
-Oh?
-I did GCSE Art.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.240
So, yeah, just using
the skills and techniques
I picked up from then.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.360
This is just a sketch.
It'll look a lot better when
a professional's done it.

-All right, yeah.
Thanks so much for this.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.000
I was going to go Snappy
Snaps, but Grindah said
you could do it cheaper.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.600
Yeah, I've actually got
my own printing machine here.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.720
-Pretty?
-Printing machine, so...

03:56.760 --> 03:59.680

Oh, right, yeah.
Printing machine, yeah, course.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.760
I got it off Uncle
Bobby. Yeah, he told me
that it's like a 3D printer,

04:06.800 --> 04:09.360
but 2D, so you actually
save on energy.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.640
-It's so big!
-That's what they
all bloody say.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.760
Yeah, when it comes to fashion,
I'm always one step ahead.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.240
Sometimes, people look at me
strangely and wonder
what I'm wearing.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.120
These are actually
women's boots.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.680
I like the heel on them,
I like the texture of them.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.440
They're very silky smooth,
easy clean.

04:24.480 --> 04:28.160

04:28.200 --> 04:30.240

at the mosque.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.280
Okay, so I've sketched out
a sort of family portrait.

04:33.320 --> 04:37.720
Obviously, this is rough,
so the final product will need
to be sort of more classy,

04:37.760 --> 04:41.440
but with that sort
of essence of heaven.
Like, does that sound okay?

04:41.480 --> 04:46.480
Yeah, definitely. Listen,
I can handle anything. I'm
a self-made guy, you know.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.120

in '93 with nothing but
£5 and my brother's passport.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.240

06:03.520 --> 06:05.920
then I'm there, either way.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.600
[director] Why do you care
about them so much?

06:09.640 --> 06:13.600
That's a bit of a weird
question, to be honest, like...

I'm just there, innit.
They're like...family.

and Angel's dance routine,
obviously in the early stages,

06:22.200 --> 06:25.480

06:38.440 --> 06:40.960
Decoy, stand back a bit.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.120
Right, so I've toned down
the dance routine.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.480
We don't need
a dance routine.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.920
Yeah. No, sure. Absolutely,
yeah. We can see how
it goes on the day.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.520

way, aren't we, Ange?

and keep it simple?
-Lasso, lasso.

Miche, stop going over
the top with everything.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.920
Do you remember the gun
fingers I taught you?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.400
Don't confuse her,
she's got to remember
the christening routine.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.720
No, she doesn't!
Angel, don't do a routine!

07:14.440 --> 07:17.240
Right, so I've
sorted the T-shirts.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.920
Uh, what else, what else?
Ooh! Do you want to see
her christening dress?

07:20.960 --> 07:24.440
-Angel, are you looking forward
to getting christianed?
-Yes.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.080
You know you're going to have
a new godfather tomorrow, yeah?

07:27.120 --> 07:30.800
Which means you will always
have a guardian to protect you

07:30.840 --> 07:34.120
throughout your tiny life.
Yeah?

07:34.160 --> 07:37.560
Ideally, though, I suppose
he needs to be somebody

07:37.600 --> 07:40.880
that has experience of actually
being a legal guardian.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.920
Innit? She agreed.
Angel agreed with me!

07:44.960 --> 07:47.080
Isn't that a bit much?

07:47.120 --> 07:49.800
No, cos this way she could
re-use it later on in life.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.520
I got a couple of sizes
bigger so maybe within the
next 18 months to two years,

07:54.560 --> 07:57.360
she could use it
as a bridesmaid's dress.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.400
No, cos we don't know anyone
that's getting married and...
Let's just change the subject.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.520
Oh! This brings me back.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.360
Hit me, Angel. Hit me.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.640
Hit me!

08:13.680 --> 08:16.200
Hit me. Angel, hit me!

08:16.240 --> 08:21.640

08:30.320 --> 08:32.760
He can be a right old laugh,

their level, mentally.

-Right, now you're both dead.
-I'm not!

Decoy, but I think that's
cos she sees more of him.</i>

-She's very spontaneous.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.000
Sometimes she'll just head
out for a couple of months

09:24.040 --> 09:28.160
and she'll come back with,
you know, my credit card.
Hopefully, this time, Aldona!

09:30.080 --> 09:33.560
You know, she's like a
bloody sexy, slutty Frisbee.

You know, I throw
her away sometimes.
She'll always come back, mate.

Banter, banter.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.960
No, please come back, Aldona.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.720
So do you know who the
godfather's going to be, then?

09:46.760 --> 09:49.200
I feel like it has
to be Beats, surely?

09:49.240 --> 09:52.840
Cos, you know, I think
he'd be really good,
like caring and thoughtful.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.920
Well, you still got Decoy
in the running.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.480
I just think it feels
a bit weird Decoy
being the godfather.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.160
-Why would it be weird?
-Oh, I dunno.

10:02.200 --> 10:06.720
Oh, Miche, come on!

the 21st century, all right?

-Skin colour does not matter.
-Oh, my God! No,
I'm not saying that.

-You may.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.720
Killed it.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.240
-Smashed it.
-Oh, my God. Chapatti...

10:38.280 --> 10:41.880
I think I hate them.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.320
This is ruined!
[she sobs]

10:45.360 --> 10:47.640
What the fuck's
she going on about? Miche!

10:47.680 --> 10:50.240
-Tell him to fuck off!
-It glitters.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.480
-Fucking hell, mate. Jesus!
-Classy.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.520
I'm not having her crying
all through my godfather
announcement, all right?

10:56.560 --> 10:59.120
Right, we need
to think of something.

10:59.160 --> 11:03.080
Here's what we're going to do.
You bosh out some T-shirts,
something simple.

11:03.120 --> 11:07.520
-Just like a picture
of Angel and the date.
-Okay, cool.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.680
-So what are you going to do?
-What do you mean?

11:10.720 --> 11:14.920
No, I thought
you were going to say,
"And I'll do this and that".

11:14.960 --> 11:18.280
Mate, I've got a very important,
life-changing decision

11:18.320 --> 11:21.040
to make, yeah,
about my daughter,
who's getting christianed.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.640
I ain't got time to be fucking
around with you and that. Sweet.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.440
Cool.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.360
Delegations.
You know what I mean?

11:28.400 --> 11:31.960
For fuck's sake,
how do you do this? Miche!

11:33.920 --> 11:35.120
Miche!

11:35.160 --> 11:37.760
[she sobs]
Go away!

11:37.800 --> 11:41.000
I need help with my tie.
I can't clip it on.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.360
[director]
Are you big into your religion?

11:43.400 --> 11:46.160
No, we're not really
religious sort of people.

11:46.200 --> 11:50.000
I'd say, personally, if I was
to choose one I related to,

11:50.040 --> 11:53.240
-I'd probably be Rasta.
-Would they do christenings?

11:53.280 --> 11:57.040
Yeah. They do their own sort
of tip, where they all go into,

11:57.080 --> 12:01.200
like, a mountain in Jamaica and
just all sit in a massive tent,

12:01.240 --> 12:03.600
-relaxing and blazing
all night.
-Yeah.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.760
-That's nice.
-Thank you.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.760
I thought the pink looks
quite nice, doesn't it,
with the brown of the cross?

12:22.920 --> 12:25.880
Ah, Miche gets proper
weird around churches.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.160
She starts banging on
about marriage constantly.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.000
I don't see why she'd want
me and her to be related.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.880
If anything, I think that
would put me off wanting
to do anything with her.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.000
It's basically incest, innit?

12:40.040 --> 12:43.560
So do you do any sort of
loyalty discounts here then?

12:43.600 --> 12:47.200
-You mean for other events?
-Yeah, like weddings or...

12:47.240 --> 12:51.440
Well, weddings are a slightly
different case because,
for a wedding,

12:51.480 --> 12:53.800
you have to be a member
of the congregation.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.840
See the mic situation? Is it
wireless based or is it...?

12:57.880 --> 13:00.720
-We don't have mics, sorry.
-No mics?

13:00.760 --> 13:03.400
-No worries, I've got my own.
-All right, okay.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.800
Just so you know,
your friend is down there.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.360
-He's been here all night.
-Oh, for fuck's sake. Steves!

13:09.400 --> 13:13.200
-Steves! Wake up, you mess!
-I got your text message.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.360
Did I miss the cremation?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.760
Nah, you got a good
20 minutes left.

13:17.800 --> 13:22.200
-Sorry, can I help you?
-Ah! You have got a mic.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.960
Well, it's for... We use this
for, sort of, big services.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.360
This is going to be a big
service. How do you...?

13:29.400 --> 13:31.880
Pop that in there for me,
please, mate. Go on.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.640
-Well...
-Come on. No, out the way.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.200
Woah! We're gonna have
to get this removed.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.000
-[Steves] Is there anything
I can be sick into?
-Yeah, there's loads of stuff.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.360
Here you go.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.120
-Cheers, man.
-It's all right, mate.
We'll wash it.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.520
That's not going to be enough.
Is there a bigger one?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.640
<i>[Steves] Nah, I wouldn't say
I got a drug problem.</i>

13:49.680 --> 13:52.240
<i>I've got the opposite of
a drug problem, to be honest.</i>

13:52.280 --> 13:55.720
I've got no problem
with drugs whatsoever.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.200
I'll try anything.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.800
-We gather in the front.
-Yeah, yeah. You've got
everyone sitting there.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.240
I'll probably pop you
off to the side there.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.840
-I'm by the font, normally.
-Yeah? No, that's good.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.520
Good, good, good,
good, good.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.160
There it is.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.640
You're going to get
christianed in there.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.640
That's where you're
going to meet God!

14:17.680 --> 14:22.480
Not if you don't make it down
the stairs in them heels, Carol!

14:22.520 --> 14:26.480
Just wiggle in. Come here.
Let me look at you, darling.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.680
Ah, that's nice.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.240
Here she is! Look at
the princess! Ah!

14:31.280 --> 14:34.400
Your shirt's untucked.
Is he looking?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.680
Come on.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.720
-Grindah, you see that?
-What?

14:39.760 --> 14:43.520
-Just tucked Craig's shirt in...
-You have to go in, mate.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.520
-You've got a bit of glitter
on your cheek.
-What?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.720
-Bit of glitter. Bit of glitter.
-Is it gone?

14:48.760 --> 14:50.360
Yeah.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.560
Miche? Have you
got any pants on?

14:52.600 --> 14:56.320
-What? Yeah!
I've got a thong on.
-Just looking.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.080
-Hello.
-Hello.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.240
-Mum, this is the vicar.
-Hello, darling.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.480
-And this is Angel.
-Nice to meet you.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.960
-Lovely to meet you.
-Just say hello to the vicar.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.160
-I'll come and speak to you.
-All right.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.160
Hello. Welcome, welcome.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.320
-Don't you look lovely?
-Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

15:17.360 --> 15:19.560
Like a little angel.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.920
I've just come
straight from the rave?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.000
Do you still feel fucked?

15:31.040 --> 15:33.400
Mic's not working. Come on.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.400
Try it. Try it.
It's not working.

15:36.440 --> 15:40.520
I had face paint all over
my face when I got here.

15:40.560 --> 15:44.680
Lucky there was that little sink
on the way in to wash your face.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.440
Mate, that's holy water.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.640
What happens if you get
it on your face?

15:51.680 --> 15:54.440
Makes you religious
or something.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.120
I didn't mean to be religious.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.440
Hope they've got them ready,
to be honest, mate, cos...

16:14.480 --> 16:19.160
I haven't got time, mate. I've
been up all night, you know.
I'm not in the mood, mate.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.480
All right, geezer. I'm here
to pick up my T-shirts.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.040
-I've got a receipt for you.
-Yeah, mate.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.120
Nice bit of kit you've got
there, actually, mate.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.960
-Is it a smooth mechanism
on that, yeah?
-Yeah, it's okay.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.680
Do you make some decent
profit off that?

16:34.720 --> 16:37.400
What kind of money you making,
net profit, kind of margins?

16:37.440 --> 16:39.640
-I'm not sure.
-Cash flow?

16:39.680 --> 16:43.000
-That's £225, please.
-225 quid!

16:43.040 --> 16:46.360
-I'm sorry for your loss,
by the way.
-Huh?

16:46.400 --> 16:50.560
No, it's fine, mate.
It's no problem.
It's very reasonable anyway.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.600
You've got to lose some
to gain some, you know?

16:53.640 --> 16:55.320
Do your pout.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.120
-Perfect! Stunning.
-Nice.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.720
-Miche, Miche.
-What?

17:01.760 --> 17:04.400
-What's he want?
-I don't know.
Can you watch my bag?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.520
Yeah, course I can.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.680
Come on, come on.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.599
Easy!

17:10.640 --> 17:14.480
How you doing, Selecta?
You all right, yeah?

17:14.520 --> 17:17.160
Angel. Angel.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.400
Angel.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.280
Angel.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.640
Angel.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.880
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah!

17:26.920 --> 17:29.680
-You got him to re-do
the T-shirts!
-Yeah.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.000
-That's so romantic!
-It's not romantic,
it's just normal.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.360
That shows how committed
you are to me.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.080
Not really, you just
needed them done, so don't...

17:37.120 --> 17:39.360
Ta-dah!

17:39.400 --> 17:42.120
Oh, my God.
They are stunning!

17:42.160 --> 17:46.320
-Oh, thank you so much!
-No worries. No worries.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.760
Craigy boy! Have a look.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.520
One for you, mate.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.240
It looks like she's died!

17:56.080 --> 17:59.960
Oh, man, that T-shirt!
Like she was, you know...

18:00.000 --> 18:04.040
We were at a wake or something.
It was really funny.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.400
Hoh!

18:06.440 --> 18:09.200
-Stevie...T-shirt.
-Sorry.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.280
Jesus' eyes were watching me.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.880
No, Miche, it ain't going
to go over. No, I can tell.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.440
Put it on, Beats, mate.
Put it on, mate. Come on!

18:19.480 --> 18:22.280
Take your top off.
Take your top off. Yeah.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.520
-All right, shall we go up?
-Angel.

18:33.560 --> 18:37.680
Will you take pictures?
You can take some pictures.
Just go up there.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.840
-Just go like that.
-Thank you.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.720
Angel, do you wish
to be baptised?

18:44.760 --> 18:47.280
Say yes, Angel, yeah?

18:47.320 --> 18:49.680
-Yes.
-Yes? Well done.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.360
-Let us pray.
-Hands together, everybody!

18:52.400 --> 18:54.480
Or not, is it? Nah.

18:54.520 --> 18:59.240
Here, we are washed by the
Holy Spirit and made clean.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.840
Here, we are
clothed with Christ,

19:01.880 --> 19:05.280
dying to sin that we may
live His risen life.

19:05.320 --> 19:09.920
-Decoy. Shall I
take Angel for a bit?
-If you want, mate.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.720
Yeah. Come on.
Come to Uncle Beats.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.160
-You got her?
-Yeah, come on.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.760
You give to your
faithful people new life
in the water of baptism.

19:19.800 --> 19:24.200
Angel. Just stand closer
to me than Uncle Decoy, yeah?

19:24.240 --> 19:27.280
..May serve you in faith
and love and grow...

19:27.320 --> 19:30.600
Is that your family over there?
It's a bit weird, innit?

19:30.640 --> 19:34.120
"Ooh, I'm Decoy.
I bring my family with me.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.080
I want to be godfather."

19:36.120 --> 19:37.720
-..Amen.
-Pathetic.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.000
And now we come
to the responses.

19:41.040 --> 19:45.000
Do you reject the devil and
all rebellion against God?

19:45.040 --> 19:47.200
-Everyone? Yes!
-I reject them.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.560
The responses are on the sheet.
"I reject them".

19:49.600 --> 19:53.080
-I reject them.
-Do you renounce the deceit
and corruption of evil?

19:53.120 --> 19:55.200
-Yeah, I do.
-I renounce them.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.280
Do you turn to Christ
as saviour?

19:58.320 --> 20:00.040
-Yeah.
-I turn to Christ.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.920
Do you submit to Christ,
our Lord?

20:02.960 --> 20:05.440
I submit to Christ, our Lord.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.240
Christ claims you for his own.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.320
Receive the sign of his cross.

20:13.360 --> 20:17.400
[Grindah laughs] It's like,
I was thinking, the power
of Christ compels you!

20:17.440 --> 20:20.120
-Yes, all right, thank you.
-That's from <i> Exorcist,</i> innit?

20:20.160 --> 20:22.880
About the girl's mum noshing
people off to hell! I love that!

20:22.920 --> 20:25.200
If the father would like
to step forward, please.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.400
No worries, mate.
I'll take over from here.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.040
-Pass me the mic, please, mate.
-Yeah, sure.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.000
Angel, if you just stand there.
Right!

20:33.040 --> 20:34.800
Welcome, people.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.280
As you all know, I've
had the important decision

20:38.320 --> 20:40.640
of who will be the godfather.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.800
-Very important.
-Exactly.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.920
It's, uh... it's something
I took very seriously.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.760
I even watched this
film called <i> The Godfather</i>
to help me work out

20:49.800 --> 20:51.600
what it is they actually do.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.760
I didn't end up watching
it all, cos it is quite long.

20:54.800 --> 20:59.080
But the point is,
I learnt that it is more
than just some little name

20:59.120 --> 21:02.480
given to you by some silly
little John in a church. Yeah?

21:02.520 --> 21:06.480
It's about loyalty.
It's about respect.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.960
It's about being the
head of a crime family.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.880
Which is something we know a
little bit about, isn't it?

21:12.920 --> 21:18.160
So, for that reason,
I feel there is no one better
for the role of godfather...

21:18.200 --> 21:20.360
than...

21:20.400 --> 21:22.960
Me! MC Grindah!

21:24.720 --> 21:28.680
I now declare myself godfather!

21:28.720 --> 21:32.480
[applause]

21:32.520 --> 21:34.440
Good, good.

21:36.480 --> 21:40.040
Should have had, maybe,
little drinks for this bit.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.160
Like a toast.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.960
Anyway, good.
Back to you, mate.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.440
The best man won in the end
of the day, innit?

21:49.480 --> 21:52.600
-Good job, mate.
-Yeah, same to you, mate.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.520
..And come to the inheritance
of the saints in glory, amen.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.800
You're christianed!

21:57.840 --> 22:00.640
-[applause]
-Thanks. Thank you, everybody.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.640
-Amen!
-Amen!

22:02.680 --> 22:05.320
Come on then, let's go.
Let's go and eat buffet.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.200
Thank you, everybody.
Great ceremony, innit?

22:08.240 --> 22:10.800
Yeah, it was really
good, man. Craig!

22:10.840 --> 22:13.240
Come on, come with Mum.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.440
Went well.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.840
[director]
What about Angel, is she happy?

22:18.880 --> 22:22.400
Ah, very much so.
She didn't have a clue
about it and, to be honest,

22:22.440 --> 22:25.920
if she had some next John
always there, she'd be
like, "Who's that?"

22:25.960 --> 22:30.240
She's got Daddy there,
do you know what I mean,
aka The Godfather, like.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.320
Steves! It's time to go.

22:35.360 --> 22:39.080
-What you doing?
-Just...just talking to Jesus.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.440
What you saying to him?

22:41.480 --> 22:43.800
Just apologising, cos...

22:43.840 --> 22:46.280
I'm a bit worried that
he's put a curse on me.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.320
You're just on
a come-down, man.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.640
We'll go back to Grindah's
and we'll sort all this out.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.960
Bye, Jesus.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.720
Going to church is definitely
one of the most...

22:56.760 --> 22:59.320
like, intense things you can
do on a come-down, really.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.480
Oh, wait a second.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.720
<i>But I just try and avoid
comedowns as much as possible.</i>

23:05.760 --> 23:07.680
<i>[director]
How do you avoid them?</i>

23:07.720 --> 23:10.400
Just do more drugs, basically.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.320
[music plays]

23:15.360 --> 23:18.440
Go on, give it a go, Craig.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.880
Probably got
Little Mix on there.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.280
Listen to me, Miche.
I just think...

23:27.320 --> 23:30.480
Decoy would be a better
choice, that's all.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.800
It doesn't really matter.
All that matters is that
Angel's going to go heaven.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.680
-He's the perfect man.
-Whatever, Mum.
Nobody's perfect.

23:37.720 --> 23:41.200
If he ain't, he'll fucking
do till Mr Perfect turns up.
Cheers, darling.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.560
-I would smash him
into next week.
-Mum!

23:43.600 --> 23:45.840
I would! I don't care!

23:45.880 --> 23:48.640
He'd wake up, "Ooh, what day is
it?" "It's next week, darling."

23:48.680 --> 23:50.320
Oh!

23:55.480 --> 23:58.440
Beats! Decoy!
Ready for you, mate!

23:58.480 --> 24:02.080
I got to go do this
Jah ceremony to help
Steves with his come-down.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.120
-Yeah. Sweet.
-Take a seat there.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.120
Yeah!

24:07.160 --> 24:09.560
-Miche! Miche!
-Huh?

24:09.600 --> 24:12.120
How about Angel?
I have got it all ready.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.240
-Nah, do her when she's older.
-Sure?

24:14.280 --> 24:17.560
Cos we have hotboxed her room
out, so we are good to go.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.360
Yeah, that's fine.
She's busy doing her karaoke.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.800
-Last chance!
-No, it's fine.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.200
All right, sweet!

24:25.240 --> 24:27.800
[director] Do you think
that Grindah and Miche
are good parents?

24:27.840 --> 24:33.400
Well, you know,
I don't judge other people.
But, no, probably not.

24:33.440 --> 24:38.320
<i>Miche is lovely
and I reckon she's doing
her best, but, you know,</i>

24:38.360 --> 24:41.520
<i>with an absolute
twat in the house...</i>

24:41.560 --> 24:44.480
How can...how can
he be a good father?

24:44.520 --> 24:47.480
[clapping and cheering]

24:47.520 --> 24:49.840
Who wants cake?
Do you want cake?

24:49.880 --> 24:52.600
-Yeah, I'll have some.
-Happy christening!

24:52.640 --> 24:55.200
What sort of portion
control do you...?

24:55.240 --> 24:57.800
Steves, this is for you,
mate, all right?

24:57.840 --> 25:00.240
We'll get you back,
keep toking it.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.880
♪ If it wasn't for the girl
you're holding tight ♪

25:02.920 --> 25:06.840
♪ If it wasn't for the girl
you're holding tonight ♪

25:06.880 --> 25:09.400
I watched this
documentary once,

25:09.440 --> 25:12.440
where they all just
go into a hill in Jamaica

25:12.480 --> 25:16.720
in a fucking big tent
and just chill and blaze.

25:16.760 --> 25:21.680
And that's how you cleanse
yourself with the
power of Jah Rastafari.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.240
[director]
What is Rastafarianism?

25:24.280 --> 25:28.520
Uh, you're so white!
Rastafarianism is a movement

25:28.560 --> 25:31.520
that started in Jamaica...

25:31.560 --> 25:34.720
with a geezer
called Bob Marley

25:34.760 --> 25:39.840
and he just blazed a lot,
made some of the best
music in the world.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.560
Boom, there you go.
The Rastas was born.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.440
Oh, I can feel it now.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.120
I can feel the
curse being lifted.

25:49.160 --> 25:52.160
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-Go on, then!

25:52.200 --> 25:54.520
-Go on, Ange!
-Oh, yeah!

25:56.440 --> 25:59.400
Oh, I love it! I love it!

25:59.440 --> 26:01.320
Whoo!

26:01.360 --> 26:03.080
Aaah!

26:11.960 --> 26:14.680
Easy. Just exorcised
Steves' come-down.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.160
Jesus has been defeated!

26:25.360 --> 26:28.040
That's it. Spin her, spin her!

26:29.560 --> 26:32.280
Now you spin me!

26:32.320 --> 26:35.040
Spin Mummy, Ange. Spin Mummy.

26:40.440 --> 26:44.600
<i>Yeah, I made the right decision
with the whole godfather thing.
At the end of the day...</i>

26:44.640 --> 26:47.200
you don't send a boy in
to do a man's job, do ya?

26:47.240 --> 26:50.520
Yeah, but you know
I'd always be there
for you anyway, so...

26:50.560 --> 26:54.520
[Grindah] I checked it out and
there's not actually that much
to it. It's just good to get her
done.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.880
-Yeah, set her up
for life and that.
-Exactly.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.400
Cos if she does end up going
down a darker path or whatever,

27:01.440 --> 27:04.520
like, becoming a brass or
a murderer or whatever,

27:04.560 --> 27:07.160
then I know she'll
always go to heaven.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.480
