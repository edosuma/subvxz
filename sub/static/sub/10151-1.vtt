00:40.142 --> 00:41.343
Don't.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.012
There's no place for
you in the human world.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.214
I beg to differ, sister.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.118
There is.

01:42.971 --> 01:44.439
Gina,
darling, listen to me.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.940
I'm not talk to you as an agent.

01:45.941 --> 01:47.676
I'm talking to you as a friend.

01:36.842 --> 01:41.770
<b>SHE WOLF RISING
Subrip: Pix</b>

01:48.876 --> 01:50.009
It's not the right
project for you.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.277
It's not what you do best.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.114
And you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.849
Just give me the goddamn
scorsese audition

01:55.850 --> 01:57.284
and I'll show you.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.586
You don't
have to show me anything.

01:58.587 --> 02:00.222
I know you're a good actress.

02:00.223 --> 02:01.554
The best in your field.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.923
Yeah well, maybe
I'm better to move on

02:02.924 --> 02:05.559
to a bigger and
better field.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.860
Darling, I believe you

02:06.861 --> 02:08.262
and I believe in you,

02:08.263 --> 02:10.264
but there's no way I can
get you into that audition.

02:10.265 --> 02:12.466
Why? Because I'm a
fucking scream queen?

02:12.467 --> 02:14.202
What do
you want me to say, Gina?

02:14.203 --> 02:16.436
I want you to say
that you'll do your job

02:16.437 --> 02:18.138
and get me the audition.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.507
Excuse me.

02:19.508 --> 02:20.909
Do you even have a
photo of yourself

02:20.910 --> 02:23.078
that doesn't have you
dripping in blood?

02:24.079 --> 02:26.114
I have a perfect shot.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.014
God help me.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.849
Okay, put your picture
in an envelope.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.018
Shit.

02:31.019 --> 02:32.252
Tape
it to your door.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.054
If Pete doesn't see
it when he drives by,

02:33.055 --> 02:34.354
you know he won't stop.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.689
Shit.

02:36.258 --> 02:37.390
Sorry darling,

02:37.391 --> 02:39.092
you know he's a pain in the ass.

02:39.093 --> 02:41.061
No, it's 'cause I
just cut my finger

02:41.062 --> 02:42.664
'cause you got me aggravated!

02:42.665 --> 02:45.166
B-blood alive.

02:45.167 --> 02:46.634
Shut the hell up.

02:47.902 --> 02:49.069
You know.

02:49.804 --> 02:52.240
Just need a new goddamn agent.

02:52.507 --> 02:54.009
Stupid bullshit.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.944
New agent is what I have to do.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.747
Then I'll get good parts.

03:04.019 --> 03:06.487
Shit. Fuck. Fuck.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.822
God damn it.

03:15.597 --> 03:16.531
Fuck.

03:26.341 --> 03:28.576
Say hello to your boss for me.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.342
It's like I told ya,

04:02.343 --> 04:05.513
you can run but you cannot hide.

04:06.114 --> 04:08.116
Rufus gon' cut you

04:08.616 --> 04:10.618
side to side.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.492
No!

04:21.362 --> 04:23.298
What the fuck'd you do that for?

04:26.634 --> 04:27.601
Fuck!

04:29.004 --> 04:29.871
Hahaha.

04:29.872 --> 04:30.938
No!

04:31.740 --> 04:33.007
Fuck you!

04:38.747 --> 04:40.014
You dumb twat.

04:41.283 --> 04:44.485
What the fuck'd you have
to go and do that for?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.056
Anyway, it's okay.

04:49.057 --> 04:50.358
It's okay.

04:50.992 --> 04:54.527
No, it's alright,
everything gon' be,

04:54.528 --> 04:56.331
everything gon' be just fine.

04:56.898 --> 04:58.300
I can still carve you up.

05:01.903 --> 05:05.539
Why Rufus, you are one
sick, mother fuckin' puppy,

05:05.540 --> 05:06.708
you know that?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.610
Thank you, Professor.

05:09.110 --> 05:10.778
Hahahaha.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.014
Shit!

05:16.084 --> 05:17.651
Shit!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.387
Shit!

05:20.689 --> 05:22.357
What the fuck are you?

05:24.526 --> 05:25.860
You're a fuckin' zombie!

05:26.427 --> 05:28.027
You're a fuckin' cunt!

05:28.028 --> 05:30.964
I know you! You're a
fuckin' zombie, right?

05:31.432 --> 05:33.167
I'm part of
Amy, Professor.

05:33.168 --> 05:34.201
Hahaha, fuck!

05:36.737 --> 05:37.906
Shit!

05:41.875 --> 05:45.611
Dude, that was so
totally fucking awesome.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.749
I mean, that fucking rocks.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.316
What'd you think of her?

05:49.317 --> 05:51.252
Do you really need to
ask me that question?

05:52.353 --> 05:55.388
If she was vomiting and
had explosive diarrhea,

05:55.389 --> 05:56.823
I still wouldn't
kick her outta bed.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.491
I would climb up into her ass.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.727
I would build a summer home

05:59.728 --> 06:01.261
and I would vacation
there on the weekends.

06:01.262 --> 06:03.996
How the hell did you get
your hands on this DVD?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.232
The movie's not even out yet.

06:05.233 --> 06:06.400
I know, right?

06:06.401 --> 06:08.103
Tell me, you fuck!

06:08.670 --> 06:10.205
Trust me, I wish I could.

06:10.206 --> 06:11.438
But...

06:11.439 --> 06:12.941
Do you need me to
punch you in the dick?

06:12.942 --> 06:14.140
Is that what you need?

06:14.141 --> 06:16.744
Alright, you ever
had one of those things

06:16.745 --> 06:17.878
where you're not really
sure if you're dreaming

06:17.879 --> 06:18.913
or if it's real?

06:19.913 --> 06:20.949
Mmhmm.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.217
You're gonna think I'm nuts.

06:23.218 --> 06:24.717
Dude, I've known you
since kindergarten.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.186
There's no doubt in
my mind that you're

06:26.187 --> 06:28.321
a big ol' fuckin' bag of crazy.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.490
Tell me!

06:32.394 --> 06:33.828
You know you want to.

06:33.829 --> 06:35.061
Alright, I'll tell you

06:35.062 --> 06:37.031
but you gotta promise
not to tell anybody.

06:39.901 --> 06:42.537
Alright, so I was in the
magazine store, right?

06:42.538 --> 06:44.470
And I was tryin'
to distract myself,

06:44.471 --> 06:45.806
get my mind off Allison.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.010
Then, I saw it.

06:51.646 --> 06:52.646
Saw what?

06:53.415 --> 06:55.150
The latest issue
of Dude On Dude?

06:55.617 --> 06:57.018
You're a dick. No.

06:57.019 --> 06:58.518
The latest issue
of Scream Sirens

06:58.519 --> 07:01.287
with none other than

07:01.288 --> 07:03.390
Gina Skylar on the cover.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.159
Dude, I have that issue.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.660
I love that issue.

07:07.661 --> 07:11.398
Like, that issue could be
the ultimate homo test.

07:11.399 --> 07:13.400
If you don't catch wood
lookin' at that picture,

07:13.401 --> 07:15.103
bing, you're a frickin' homo.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.471
Did you read the
article on the inside?

07:17.906 --> 07:20.341
No. What for? I
looked at the picture.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.978
The magazine was
just the overture.

07:26.581 --> 07:27.715
Continue.

07:28.016 --> 07:29.816
As I read the
article, I realized

07:29.817 --> 07:31.885
that there was a lot more
to this princess of darkness

07:31.886 --> 07:33.221
than meets the eye.

07:33.588 --> 07:35.590
True, her curvacious
body was the cause

07:35.591 --> 07:38.025
for the petrified
forest in my pants,

07:38.026 --> 07:39.160
but her eyes?

07:39.894 --> 07:41.527
Her eyes as beautiful
as they were

07:41.528 --> 07:43.598
seemed to be crying
out for me to help.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.367
I clung to every word as
I read her intimate story.

07:47.769 --> 07:50.538
My heart's rhythm changed.
My breathing changed.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.342
Suddenly, the world
seemed different.

07:56.444 --> 07:59.213
I felt lighter and more
alive than ever before.

08:03.117 --> 08:04.853
Something was happening to me.

08:05.487 --> 08:08.156
It was frightening and
exhilarating at the same time.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.925
I wanted and thirsted for more.

08:12.427 --> 08:14.628
I eternally ached for
this euphoric sensation

08:14.629 --> 08:15.929
my entire life.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.031
And now the doors have opened

08:18.365 --> 08:20.400
letting in a
fantasmagoric feeling

08:20.401 --> 08:22.403
that I surrender to completely.

08:48.596 --> 08:49.964
Thank you.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.337
Do you want me to sign that?

08:59.307 --> 09:00.774
That would be awesome.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.276
Awesome.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.678
Do you have a pen?

09:05.279 --> 09:08.649
Hold on.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.085
Hey, can I borrow a pen?

09:12.086 --> 09:13.353
No.

09:13.354 --> 09:14.720
What do you think this
is, a charity center?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.024
If you want a pen,
you gotta buy it.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.925
If you're gonna write
in that magazine,

09:17.926 --> 09:19.360
you gotta buy that shit too.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.729
This ain't a fuckin' library.

09:22.764 --> 09:23.531
Thank you.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.432
What's your name?

09:25.600 --> 09:26.367
Jake.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.368
Turn around, Jake.

09:32.373 --> 09:33.241
What?

09:43.216 --> 09:44.018
There you go.

09:44.019 --> 09:45.186
Thank you.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.788
Maybe I'll see
you around, Jake.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.192
Hey asshole, this
isn't enough money.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.596
You still owe me 30 cents.

09:58.966 --> 09:59.933
Dipshit.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.639
No fucking way.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.975
Way.

10:07.508 --> 10:10.278
I never went home that night
because I lost the magazine.

10:10.912 --> 10:13.247
The magazine in which
Gina Skylar wrote,

10:13.248 --> 10:14.781
"I'm sure we'll meet again."

10:15.515 --> 10:18.218
Those words vibrated
up and down my spine.

10:20.355 --> 10:22.389
I kept thinking about
her and wondering

10:23.658 --> 10:25.460
would I ever see her again?

10:30.565 --> 10:32.133
How are you, young man?

10:33.500 --> 10:34.668
You're Jake, right?

10:34.969 --> 10:36.402
This was unbelievable.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.805
Robert Lonzo, the
biggest producer

10:38.806 --> 10:40.507
of horror films in the world

10:40.508 --> 10:42.377
was calling my name.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.380
He's the man responsible
for discovering Gina Skylar.

10:47.381 --> 10:48.215
Yeah, I am.

10:48.216 --> 10:49.517
Come here!

10:49.616 --> 10:52.486
I hear you're a
gentleman and a real fan.

10:53.388 --> 10:54.588
I guess.

10:54.589 --> 10:56.457
Don't guess, ya either
are or you're not.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.224
No, I am, sir.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.825
Good! Would ya like to get in?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.293
It's been a long time since I've

11:01.294 --> 11:03.096
spoken to a real fan.

11:03.798 --> 11:05.931
Don't worry. I'm not queer.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.201
Besides, Gina's in here too.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.239
Sure!

11:15.610 --> 11:17.911
I listened to Mr. Lonzo
as he told his war stories

11:17.912 --> 11:19.881
of how he had to fight
to get the credibility

11:19.882 --> 11:22.416
and recognition his
movies deserved.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.084
Under ordinary circumstances,

11:24.085 --> 11:26.887
I would have been riveted
in every syllable.

11:26.888 --> 11:29.790
But just knowing that
Gina was a glance away

11:29.791 --> 11:31.526
was more than I could handle.

11:33.061 --> 11:34.795
She's even more
beautiful in person

11:34.796 --> 11:36.230
than she is on the screen.

11:37.465 --> 11:39.166
Hey kid, how would
you like to help me

11:39.167 --> 11:40.901
cast my next movie?

11:40.902 --> 11:42.235
Excuse me?

11:42.470 --> 11:43.737
You heard me.

11:43.738 --> 11:46.607
I want you to help me
cast my next movie.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.808
I guess.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.343
What would I have to do?

11:50.344 --> 11:52.980
Just tell me if you
think the girls have

11:54.514 --> 11:55.649
talent.

11:57.618 --> 11:59.153
It's gonna be super fun.

11:59.787 --> 12:00.855
Jake.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.806
Never in my
wildest imagination

12:20.807 --> 12:23.778
could I have anticipated what
was about to happen to me.

12:31.686 --> 12:33.120
I can't take it anymore.

12:33.955 --> 12:36.023
Why doesn't shit like
this happen to me?

12:36.591 --> 12:37.524
Why?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.293
Why?

12:41.528 --> 12:42.896
Why don't you just go home?

12:42.897 --> 12:44.232
I'll catch up with you tomorrow.

12:44.432 --> 12:46.398
No! I'm stayin'!

12:46.399 --> 12:47.834
You're telling me
the whole story!

12:47.835 --> 12:49.437
Woah.

12:51.172 --> 12:52.005
Look,

12:53.039 --> 12:55.275
it's pathetic, I know.

12:56.244 --> 12:57.745
I got no life.

12:58.546 --> 12:59.647
I got no job.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.783
I got no girlfriend.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.052
I hadn't washed my underwear
in like three weeks.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.822
I need to hear every
single detail of this story

13:09.823 --> 13:13.160
and if you leave out one
mother fuckin' thing,

13:14.028 --> 13:15.329
I'll kill you.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.130
Lonzo told me
there were two things

13:18.131 --> 13:19.699
he looks for in talent.

13:20.134 --> 13:21.735
I think he meant three.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.877
Looking back, I kinda
feel like a pervert.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.585
I watched Lonzo as he
took detailed notes

13:38.586 --> 13:40.388
of each girl that went by.

13:40.855 --> 13:42.088
Some of them would dance close

13:42.089 --> 13:44.292
and I could see him hide
his little note pad.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.993
He was a consummate
professional.

13:47.427 --> 13:51.064
I, on the other hand, was
his complete opposite.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.066
I couldn't concentrate
on any of the strippers.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.703
I had only one girl in my mind.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.310
I just had to get outta there.

14:03.311 --> 14:05.311
My brain was on
overload and I felt

14:05.312 --> 14:07.314
I couldn't trust
any of my senses.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.683
I found solitude
in the men's room.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.586
Don't turn around.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.254
Listen to me very carefully.

14:15.056 --> 14:16.123
Okay?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.659
Lonzo's in trouble.

14:20.794 --> 14:21.528
But, I,

14:23.230 --> 14:24.465
Don't talk, baby.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.533
Just listen.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.836
Lonzo's in trouble
and I need your help.

14:31.706 --> 14:33.574
It's gonna be very dangerous,

14:34.908 --> 14:37.912
but if my gut is telling me
the right thing about you,

14:39.113 --> 14:41.549
I know that you're the
right one for the job.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.120
Can you handle it, Jake?

14:48.121 --> 14:49.389
Will you help me?

14:50.091 --> 14:51.523
I desperately
searched for the words

14:51.524 --> 14:54.261
to let her know that I
would do anything for her.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.831
But all that came out
was, "Okie dokie."

14:59.299 --> 15:00.668
Okie dokie.

15:02.570 --> 15:05.604
Really, really love a
man that has no command

15:05.605 --> 15:07.475
for the English language.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.346
So,

15:15.816 --> 15:17.851
here's my home address.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.821
My personal number

15:22.456 --> 15:24.425
is in your back pocket.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.027
You call me later

15:27.028 --> 15:29.230
and I'll tell you
what we're doing next.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.668
Don't be nervous.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.349
That's better.

15:49.750 --> 15:50.884
See ya later?

15:59.659 --> 16:02.796
Do you have any idea
how good that tongue felt?

16:02.797 --> 16:04.731
No, I'd like to try.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.802
Worked for George Michael.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.249
Goddamn
bitch. Well, I warned her.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.618
Shit.

16:26.354 --> 16:28.189
I don't wanna do all this
fuckin' work for her.

16:28.956 --> 16:29.889
Damn it.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.659
Ya know what, this'll show her.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.661
That's it. This is it.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.897
This is the final place.
This is where she belongs.

16:38.832 --> 16:39.932
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.034
Yeah, I told her.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.736
I warned her.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.673
God, I can't believe this.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.778
I can't believe I'm doing
all this damn work for her.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.749
Should just throw her body
down the fuckin' hill.

16:56.017 --> 16:58.686
Yeah, well no, no, this
is a better place for her.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.456
Yeah, I showed her.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.469
You always were a cold bitch.

17:38.726 --> 17:39.794
Shit!

17:41.494 --> 17:43.563
Where the fuck is my wallet?

17:48.102 --> 17:49.070
Shit.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.338
This is not happening.

17:53.074 --> 17:55.676
This is not fucking happening!

18:14.428 --> 18:15.463
Where to?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.530
Just up the road a bit.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.634
I don't know.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.735
I'd be grateful.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.507
Alright, get in.

18:33.047 --> 18:37.151
So, do you have any gum?

18:44.424 --> 18:45.625
Can I have it?

19:27.535 --> 19:29.436
Where the hell
did you get this?

19:29.970 --> 19:31.237
You tell me where
you fuckin' got this

19:31.238 --> 19:33.173
or you're fuckin' gonna die.

19:33.740 --> 19:34.942
You gave it to me.

19:35.509 --> 19:36.876
You're dead meat, missy.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.282
And what's
wrong with dead meat?

20:17.817 --> 20:18.618
Hello?

20:21.422 --> 20:22.456
Gina?

20:37.971 --> 20:39.306
Hey,

20:39.940 --> 20:40.774
it's Jake.

20:40.775 --> 20:43.509
Did you just call me or?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.113
Were you just at my apartment?

20:46.880 --> 20:48.682
Did you give
me your phone number?

20:49.383 --> 20:50.718
I don't think so.

20:51.085 --> 20:53.120
Did you tell
me where you live?

20:53.721 --> 20:54.954
No.

20:55.055 --> 20:57.157
I don't even
know your last name.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.759
It's Bubar. Jake Bubar.

20:59.893 --> 21:02.663
Well, Mr. Jake Bubar,

21:02.930 --> 21:04.597
I'll see ya at 10:30.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.298
Do you need my phone number?

21:06.299 --> 21:08.433
I have caller ID.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.604
Well, do you
need my address?

21:12.038 --> 21:13.073
Hello?

21:15.776 --> 21:18.810
That is truly fucking weird.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.079
I thought so too.

21:21.048 --> 21:23.181
My heart raced as I
walked down the hallway

21:23.182 --> 21:24.484
to Gina's apartment.

21:24.785 --> 21:26.519
I couldn't wait
to see her again.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.654
Could I be bold enough to think

21:28.655 --> 21:30.624
that we might have
a future together?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.526
Stop it! I'm way
ahead of myself.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.895
One step at a time.

21:38.932 --> 21:39.799
Hi.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.433
You must be Jake.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.368
Yeah.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.204
Gina's told us all about you.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.105
Is she in there?

21:46.472 --> 21:49.108
Don't be silly.
It's just me and Lace.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.020
Okay.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.024
Hey Jake.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.060
Come sit down.

22:08.228 --> 22:09.263
Holy snikies.

22:09.930 --> 22:11.465
She said sit down.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.868
Jake.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.138
This is gonna take a while.

22:27.381 --> 22:28.482
Baseball,
baseball, baseball,

22:28.483 --> 22:29.615
baseball, baseball.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.120
Baseball,
baseball, baseball, baseball,

22:34.121 --> 22:36.023
baseball, baseball,
baseball, baseball.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.028
I hate you.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.197
I hate you so much.

22:44.064 --> 22:45.365
Do you want me to continue?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.234
I'm so fucking deprived.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.038
Couldn't possibly
get any worse for me.

22:51.571 --> 22:52.739
Well.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.741
Just finish the fucking story.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.852
Having fun, Jake?

23:06.386 --> 23:07.653
What's this all about?

23:08.355 --> 23:09.521
They think
you're a hot shot

23:09.522 --> 23:11.624
Hollywood producer
looking for talent.

23:11.625 --> 23:12.992
Why do they think that?

23:13.527 --> 23:15.129
'Cause I told them.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.597
Hurry up, meet me at the
Chinese restaurant downtown.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.267
Fine. Bye.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.973
Girls, I have to go.

23:30.711 --> 23:32.179
You were great.

23:32.546 --> 23:35.547
I'll have my people get
in touch with your people

23:35.548 --> 23:37.417
and then they can all

23:38.285 --> 23:39.553
touch each other.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.488
Okay.

23:47.928 --> 23:48.796
Hey!

23:49.462 --> 23:50.364
Hey.

23:50.365 --> 23:51.565
How are ya? Are ya hungry?

23:52.732 --> 23:54.233
No. Just coffee.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.970
Hey Bets. Can I get
coffee for my friend here?

23:57.971 --> 23:59.172
You know we
don't serve coffee.

23:59.173 --> 24:00.239
Only green tea, hun.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.240
That'd be fine.

24:02.409 --> 24:03.576
Green tea ice cream?

24:04.044 --> 24:04.978
The usual?

24:05.445 --> 24:06.177
Absolutely.

24:06.212 --> 24:06.978
Anything for you?

24:07.013 --> 24:07.880
No, that's it. Thanks.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.552
You okay?

24:11.984 --> 24:13.186
What's up with your friends?

24:13.987 --> 24:15.088
What friends?

24:15.388 --> 24:16.489
Lace and Gwen?

24:16.490 --> 24:18.491
Yeah, those aren't my friends.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.759
Then why did
you send me there?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.361
I needed to get
Lace outta the place

24:22.362 --> 24:24.998
so I can deal with a little
detective work, ya know?

24:26.967 --> 24:28.502
So, you used me.

24:29.102 --> 24:30.269
No! No.

24:32.605 --> 24:33.940
My head's just been crazy.

24:33.941 --> 24:35.342
I've been all over the place.

24:37.344 --> 24:38.644
I didn't meant to use you.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.648
I'm sorry.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.318
You said Lonzo is in
some kind of trouble.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.788
What sort of trouble?

24:48.521 --> 24:49.622
Somebody stole the footage to

24:49.623 --> 24:51.124
Vampire Psychos Suck.

24:51.525 --> 24:52.426
Your new movie?

24:52.427 --> 24:53.558
His new movie.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.361
I was just lucky
enough to be in it.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.965
Unfortunately, it's gone
and it's my best work.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.567
Better than Blood Poison?

25:01.701 --> 25:04.605
I can't wait to see it.

25:05.571 --> 25:06.672
Well, doesn't he
have some kind of

25:06.673 --> 25:07.774
movie insurance?

25:08.075 --> 25:10.110
This is a low-budget
world, Jake.

25:10.111 --> 25:12.377
We're not a big
company. No money.

25:12.378 --> 25:13.946
No insurance.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.549
Well, why doesn't
he just reshoot?

25:17.317 --> 25:18.784
Because he broke
the cardinal rule

25:18.785 --> 25:21.153
of independent film making
and he used his own money.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.489
Now he's flat broke.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.358
Thanks.

25:26.393 --> 25:27.193
Anything for you?

25:27.194 --> 25:28.394
I'm okay. Thank you.

25:29.563 --> 25:32.230
This is his best movie yet.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.600
It's movie gold. It's his
ticket to the big league.

25:35.903 --> 25:37.904
Well, Lonzo's lucky
to have a friend like you.

25:38.171 --> 25:41.039
Me? I was workin' at
K-Mart when he discovered me.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.476
He came in to buy an
axe for body choppers.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.178
Your first movie?

25:45.979 --> 25:46.813
Yeah.

25:47.748 --> 25:49.082
I didn't believe him.

25:49.950 --> 25:53.685
Anyway, 48 months
later, 33 films later,

25:53.686 --> 25:56.322
eight box covers, four
chiller conventions,

25:56.323 --> 25:58.926
I've got a gazillion
members to my website.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.395
Number one scream queen
and I owe it all to him.

26:04.431 --> 26:06.066
Will you help me
find the footage?

26:10.237 --> 26:11.504
Gina, I don't know.

26:11.505 --> 26:13.707
I'm sorry. I know it's
a lot to ask. Forget it.

26:14.775 --> 26:16.009
I'm sorry. I just.

26:17.678 --> 26:19.146
You're a sweet guy.

26:20.180 --> 26:22.082
I shouldn't mix you up
in things like this.

26:25.152 --> 26:26.653
Forget I said anything.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.090
You have a little.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.925
What?

26:32.991 --> 26:33.961
-On your.
Shit.

26:35.295 --> 26:36.730
I just got my nails done.

26:37.096 --> 26:37.931
Would you?

26:38.464 --> 26:40.933
Sure.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.103
You can use your finger.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.937
That way it doesn't set in.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.526
I'll do it.

27:07.461 --> 27:08.760
Whatever you want.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.596
Whatever you need, just ask.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.033
I knew I could count on you.

27:39.526 --> 27:40.693
This is great.

27:41.761 --> 27:44.798
I absolutely
love this place.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.231
It looks really familiar.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.433
Yeah? Maniac Warehouse
one, two, three,

27:48.434 --> 27:49.403
and the prequel?

27:49.404 --> 27:50.635
Of course!

27:50.636 --> 27:52.904
This is where all the
dead bodies were stored.

27:52.905 --> 27:53.839
You got it.

27:54.374 --> 27:56.242
This is great.

27:56.777 --> 27:57.977
All that shit,

27:57.978 --> 27:59.111
there's still body
parts in all of those.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.947
But, why are we here?

28:01.480 --> 28:02.981
I got the keys, ya know,

28:02.982 --> 28:05.383
so we could shoot stuff
here when we needed to,

28:05.384 --> 28:07.118
and I thought you would like it.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.387
You're a fan, right?

28:08.721 --> 28:09.522
Yeah!

28:09.523 --> 28:10.856
Yeah? Do you like it?

28:15.761 --> 28:16.929
What was that for?

28:16.930 --> 28:18.699
'Cause you're
cute and I like you.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.835
Well, that's great to hear.

28:23.670 --> 28:24.571
Woah.

28:25.005 --> 28:26.473
We have work to do, Jake.

28:26.940 --> 28:28.473
Can't always just be about play.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.142
We're detectives
now and we're almost

28:30.143 --> 28:32.179
on the verge of figuring
this whole thing out.

28:32.846 --> 28:34.314
Of course.

28:34.980 --> 28:35.816
Sure you're right.

28:35.817 --> 28:37.116
Probably.

28:37.384 --> 28:40.886
But once all this
detective work is finished,

28:41.922 --> 28:43.323
then

28:43.990 --> 28:45.125
Then?

28:45.459 --> 28:47.060
You can have
anything you want.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.331
Are you okay?

28:53.333 --> 28:54.267
Wait,

28:55.035 --> 28:56.636
I think I just came in my pants.

28:56.637 --> 28:57.870
Get the hell of my

28:57.871 --> 28:58.837
-cushion now!
Nah, come on, dude.

28:58.838 --> 28:59.740
So.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.244
Shit, nobody's supposed
to be here. Come here.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.688
We're not supposed to be here.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.471
It's Lonzo.

29:32.838 --> 29:34.140
He doesn't look good.

29:38.545 --> 29:40.147
Quiet on the set!

29:40.547 --> 29:44.183
Roll sound and action!

29:44.750 --> 29:45.585
What's he doing?

29:45.620 --> 29:46.519
Shut up.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.288
Cut!

29:49.422 --> 29:50.723
Let's do it again.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.125
Get more blood in there!

29:53.794 --> 29:55.829
I want more blood in there!

29:56.163 --> 29:59.365
Make it flow like the piss
at port authorities bathroom.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.167
Shit.

30:01.768 --> 30:03.702
Do it now!

30:07.673 --> 30:08.875
That's a wrap.

30:10.777 --> 30:13.646
That's a wrap.

30:25.424 --> 30:29.428
The calla lilies
are in bloom again.

30:30.462 --> 30:31.564
What's he doing?

30:31.565 --> 30:33.700
Shut up.

30:34.401 --> 30:36.669
As God as my witness,

30:36.670 --> 30:39.805
if I have to lie,
cheat, beg, or steal,

30:39.806 --> 30:42.106
I'll never be hungry again!

30:42.107 --> 30:43.209
As God as my witness!

30:43.210 --> 30:44.044
I think he's lost it.

30:44.045 --> 30:45.478
No, he hasn't lost it.

30:46.346 --> 30:49.149
A lot of people don't know
that he's a film historian.

30:50.049 --> 30:53.986
His love for art,
film, boundless.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.122
He once told me that he
gets all his strength

30:57.123 --> 30:59.058
through great moments in cinema.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.960
Then, when he hits rock bottom,

31:01.961 --> 31:04.297
he recites lines
from classic movies.

31:06.365 --> 31:10.436
Tonight, as the clouds
are dancing around the moon,

31:10.703 --> 31:13.038
I'll be dancing around you!

31:13.373 --> 31:15.307
You and the moon.

31:15.842 --> 31:18.645
You wear a necktie
so I know it's you.

31:19.546 --> 31:20.947
I wish I had some popcorn.

31:20.948 --> 31:22.314
Shit's not funny.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.417
He's in pain.

31:25.951 --> 31:28.954
Yo, Mick! What about my prime?

31:29.623 --> 31:31.057
You help me, Polack!

31:31.290 --> 31:33.225
I don't believe you have
the nerve in your body.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.394
Lonzo.

31:36.363 --> 31:39.431
I knelt before
the bed of death.

31:39.432 --> 31:41.768
No, no, no, no. No.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.603
I knew that there
was but one thing

31:44.604 --> 31:46.605
that could bring you back to me.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.141
The scroll of Thor.

31:49.142 --> 31:50.375
No, don't do that.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.344
What is it?

31:51.611 --> 31:53.079
I'm a scream queen, you idiot.

31:53.846 --> 31:54.780
So?

31:54.881 --> 31:57.383
And so I dare the God's anger

31:57.384 --> 31:58.784
and stole it.

31:58.785 --> 32:00.553
I'm a true scream queen.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.522
I hear lines recited
from famous hor,

32:04.190 --> 32:05.057
horror films.

32:05.058 --> 32:07.026
They broke in on me

32:07.027 --> 32:11.131
and found me doing
an unholy thing.

32:11.698 --> 32:12.532
God.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.402
Tie my hands up.

32:15.437 --> 32:16.169
What?

32:16.170 --> 32:17.336
Tie my hands up!

32:17.470 --> 32:19.405
They're
coming for you, Barbara.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.806
Look! There's one of them now!

32:21.807 --> 32:22.975
Shit!

32:23.143 --> 32:24.877
Take my pants off
and tie up my legs.

32:25.979 --> 32:26.913
Shit.

32:28.181 --> 32:29.649
Hurry!

32:30.349 --> 32:35.020
The spider spinning the
web for the unworthy fly.

32:35.689 --> 32:37.423
Tighter. Tie
it fuckin' tighter.

32:39.259 --> 32:40.826
Now put something in my mouth.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.764
I am gonna learn
every frickin' word

32:45.765 --> 32:47.233
to Halloween two.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.034
Put something in my mouth.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.236
What?

32:50.470 --> 32:52.070
Put your goddamn
shirt in my mouth!

32:52.071 --> 32:53.906
Take it off and put it
in my fuckin' mouth.

32:54.307 --> 32:55.741
Now! Hurry up!

32:58.178 --> 33:01.915
The blood is the
life, Mr. Renfield.

33:02.515 --> 33:03.283
Okay?

33:05.652 --> 33:08.453
Even the man
who's pure at heart

33:08.454 --> 33:10.956
and says his prayers at night

33:13.559 --> 33:17.663
can become a wolf when
the woofbane blooms.

33:17.963 --> 33:21.600
The Autumn moon is
pure and bright.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.573
'Tis a lovely day
for an exorcism!

33:41.755 --> 33:43.223
I'll be right back, okay?

33:46.726 --> 33:47.694
Gina,

33:48.560 --> 33:49.695
I'll be right back.

33:51.964 --> 33:52.898
Mr. Lonzo.

33:54.099 --> 33:54.933
Fuck!

34:00.105 --> 34:01.839
This is gettin'
better every minute.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.609
What the fuck happened next?

34:04.144 --> 34:05.377
Mr. Lonzo, are you alright?

34:06.146 --> 34:10.250
Auntie Em, there's
no place like home.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.684
You're gonna be
alright, Mr. Lonzo.

34:17.757 --> 34:18.525
Gina?

34:19.692 --> 34:20.659
Gina?

34:32.704 --> 34:33.739
Mr. Lonzo?

34:36.809 --> 34:38.911
Okay, okay.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.282
This is one of
those reality shows.

34:43.483 --> 34:45.585
I just need to figure out where
all the camera's are hidden.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.820
Okay, I get it!

34:47.987 --> 34:50.623
I get it. You can tell me
where the camera's are now.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.560
Okay, this is a little creepy.

34:55.795 --> 34:57.396
Just listen to your inner voice.

34:57.797 --> 34:59.499
What would your inner
voice tell you to do?

35:04.871 --> 35:06.206
Get the fuck out.

35:18.251 --> 35:19.219
Gina?

35:25.492 --> 35:26.526
Gina?

35:30.295 --> 35:31.196
Gina?

35:35.335 --> 35:37.302
And where are you from?

35:38.471 --> 35:39.705
I resemble that remark.

35:39.706 --> 35:41.307
But, never you mind, you swine.

35:41.308 --> 35:43.274
I'd horsewhip you
if I had a horse.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.942
Now, down to business.

35:44.943 --> 35:48.046
Say the secret word and the
girl of your dreams will appear.

35:48.047 --> 35:49.247
What?

35:49.248 --> 35:51.216
Wrong word but,
don't worry, be happy.

35:51.217 --> 35:54.085
We have a constellation
prize for you.

35:54.086 --> 35:56.555
The girl of your nightmares!

35:56.556 --> 35:58.422
And here she is

35:58.423 --> 35:59.957
fresh from the crypt,

35:59.958 --> 36:01.959
fully loaded with
chewed up maggots

36:01.960 --> 36:03.595
and rotting flesh,

36:03.596 --> 36:06.365
dadadadadadaaaa!

36:07.867 --> 36:10.803
It's Lillian!

36:13.106 --> 36:14.805
Lillian, Lillian.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.241
Have you screwed Lillian?

36:17.242 --> 36:21.213
Lillian, the creepy lady?

36:26.418 --> 36:30.988
Well, I can see that the
two of you want to be alone.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.024
No, don't!

36:32.025 --> 36:33.425
I'll be on my way.

36:33.927 --> 36:34.894
No, don't!

36:35.862 --> 36:37.630
Let's get nasty.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.371
Woah.

36:45.672 --> 36:47.539
I need to watch a Disney movie.

36:56.048 --> 36:56.983
Who is it?

37:00.052 --> 37:00.853
Hey.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.655
Are you okay?

37:04.389 --> 37:06.558
What happened to you? I
was worried about you.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.060
You know how happy I am

37:09.061 --> 37:10.596
that you've been
helping me with this?

37:13.199 --> 37:14.400
You're amazing.

37:17.704 --> 37:19.906
But I have to do the
rest of this on my own.

37:20.340 --> 37:21.774
Are you crazy?

37:22.842 --> 37:24.942
Listen, I promised you
that I was gonna help you.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.245
And I'm not backing down until

37:26.246 --> 37:28.314
we recover that missing footage.

37:28.981 --> 37:30.516
I appreciate that.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.719
But

37:36.456 --> 37:37.724
I'm a scream queen.

37:39.559 --> 37:41.961
It doesn't matter
to me what you are.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.264
I care about you.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.003
You pussy whooped bastard.

37:51.670 --> 37:52.771
What would you have done?

37:53.005 --> 37:53.772
Well I,

37:54.641 --> 37:56.541
alright, go on.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.346
I'll be careful. I promise.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.648
Now let's come up with a plan.

38:03.983 --> 38:06.085
I just don't want
anything to happen to you.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.855
If someone's following
you or trying to stop you,

38:09.856 --> 38:11.057
then you're definitely
not the right person

38:11.058 --> 38:13.025
to be handling
this investigation.

38:14.226 --> 38:16.295
You sound so official.

38:18.097 --> 38:19.265
Just give me a hit list

38:19.266 --> 38:21.134
of all your potential
suspects, okay?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.334
I'll do what I did with
Gwen and her friend.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.803
I'll follow them and
then, at the right moment,

38:24.804 --> 38:25.972
I'll question them.

38:26.873 --> 38:28.607
Yeah, that
actually could work.

38:28.608 --> 38:30.109
I mean, you could say that
you're doing an interview

38:30.110 --> 38:32.777
for like Sirens of Cinema or
Fango or something like that.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.712
And if I tell them that
I've already interviewed you,

38:34.713 --> 38:36.080
that'll give me
instant credibility

38:36.081 --> 38:38.116
and maybe they'll
loosen up a little bit.

38:38.918 --> 38:40.153
My hero.

38:47.527 --> 38:48.760
I think we should wait.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.163
Til all this is done.

38:51.197 --> 38:52.532
Ya know, til we,

38:53.398 --> 38:54.866
go to the next level.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.036
Whatever you say, boss.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.576
Wait. Wait a minute.

39:05.478 --> 39:06.679
I just realized something.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.848
Gina Skylar was standing here

39:09.849 --> 39:11.084
in this apartment.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.085
Yeah. So?

39:13.286 --> 39:14.052
So?

39:17.155 --> 39:18.824
I think I can, I can,

39:20.092 --> 39:21.493
she sat on this
couch, didn't she?

39:22.061 --> 39:23.829
I think I can taste
her in my mouth.

39:24.097 --> 39:25.763
I can, she's actually
in my mouth right now.

39:25.764 --> 39:26.531
Dude.

39:26.532 --> 39:27.698
It's delicious.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.333
Dude, you really
gotta get a girlfriend.

39:28.334 --> 39:29.501
Eat me.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.870
Gina kept
referring to herself

39:31.871 --> 39:34.773
as a true scream queen, which
would get her very distressed.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.509
So, I searched the
libraries and internet

39:37.510 --> 39:39.645
and the only item I found
that made any reference

39:39.646 --> 39:43.114
was a screenplay titled,
"The True Scream Queen".

39:43.115 --> 39:45.517
A script that was
optioned by Robert Lonzo,

39:45.518 --> 39:47.019
but never made.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.422
Now this was getting weird.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.624
I was able to get some
info about the writer,

39:52.625 --> 39:54.058
Kiara Lupanel.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.660
She had a bestselling
novel published

39:55.661 --> 39:59.264
when she was 16 and had
written seven movies for Lonzo.

39:59.766 --> 40:02.668
This was way freaky, but
I knew I had to see her.

40:03.302 --> 40:05.270
I called her using the
guise of being a writer

40:05.271 --> 40:07.940
doing an article about her
and she agreed to see me.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.040
But once I arrived at her home,

40:10.041 --> 40:12.676
well let's just say I
wasn't exactly prepared

40:12.677 --> 40:14.346
for what was waiting for me.

41:48.940 --> 41:49.608
Kiara.

41:49.609 --> 41:50.742
Mr. Bubar?

41:50.943 --> 41:51.876
Yes.

41:51.911 --> 41:52.845
It's a true pleasure to meet

41:52.846 --> 41:54.645
another artist of the pen.

41:54.646 --> 41:55.946
You flatter me.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.314
I'm not even close to
being in your league.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.850
I won't hold it against you

41:58.851 --> 42:01.019
as long as you
don't disappoint me.

42:03.456 --> 42:05.358
You're much younger
than I thought you'd be.

42:06.324 --> 42:07.692
And more beautiful.

42:10.429 --> 42:11.697
She sleeps.

42:13.833 --> 42:14.666
Rem?

42:15.534 --> 42:16.701
Leave us for now.

42:35.788 --> 42:36.923
Nice dress.

42:37.088 --> 42:38.622
I absolutely adore dressing up

42:38.623 --> 42:40.625
as the characters I write about.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.261
Should we move
away from the chair?

42:43.262 --> 42:44.864
I don't wanna wake her.

42:45.297 --> 42:46.998
She sleeps like the death.

42:47.465 --> 42:48.966
Is she part vampire?

42:48.967 --> 42:51.303
Don't make jokes
about my Mother.

42:51.737 --> 42:53.239
She can get quite angry.

42:54.340 --> 42:56.175
You may begin your
interview now.

42:56.976 --> 42:59.278
Alright, why does
a writing prodigy

42:59.279 --> 43:01.346
put her novels on hold to write,

43:01.347 --> 43:04.750
forgive me, B horror
films for Robert Lonzo?

43:05.184 --> 43:07.286
Is that really what
you want to ask me?

43:08.487 --> 43:10.755
Then, I shall indulge you.

43:11.389 --> 43:13.992
I live through the
characters I write about.

43:14.594 --> 43:17.296
Their hopes, fears,
passions are all mine.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.865
A few years ago, you
wrote a screenplay.

43:21.300 --> 43:22.735
The True Scream Queen.

43:23.001 --> 43:25.803
Robert Lonzo optioned it but
the movie was never made.

43:25.804 --> 43:28.239
Someone's been
doing their homework.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.977
He produced seven of your
scripts, but not that one.

43:31.978 --> 43:35.047
And why is this of
such great importance to you?

43:35.547 --> 43:37.582
I have a friend and she says

43:37.583 --> 43:39.184
she's a true scream queen.

43:39.452 --> 43:42.053
A young, aspiring
actress looking to

43:42.054 --> 43:44.490
break into movies through
the horror corridor.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.091
No, nothing like that.

43:46.092 --> 43:47.660
Gina's a superstar.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.729
Gina? Gina Skylar?

43:50.730 --> 43:52.731
Yeah. Do you know her?

43:53.431 --> 43:56.100
That movie will never be
made. Mother forbids it.

43:56.101 --> 43:57.469
Please tell me more.

43:57.869 --> 44:00.538
I have to know what is
a true scream queen?

44:00.539 --> 44:02.741
Something you
need to be far away from.

44:02.742 --> 44:03.676
Please.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.244
I think I'm in love with her.

44:08.146 --> 44:11.384
Are you familiar with the
story of Romulus and Remus?

44:12.784 --> 44:14.719
Didn't they
nurse from some wolf?

44:15.621 --> 44:18.156
Not some wolf, Mr. Bubar.

44:18.157 --> 44:20.026
The she-wolf, Lupa.

44:20.525 --> 44:22.094
The true mother of Rome.

44:22.527 --> 44:24.995
She nursed the twins and
saved them from peril.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.464
When the boys grew up, the
wolf would take human form

44:27.465 --> 44:29.267
and protect and guide them.

44:29.268 --> 44:31.569
Without her, there
would be no Rome,

44:31.570 --> 44:33.572
no Caesar, no glory!

44:34.172 --> 44:36.307
How does that relate
to a true scream queen?

44:36.708 --> 44:38.543
Their lineage is connected.

44:39.478 --> 44:41.680
They share similar
traits because they're

44:41.681 --> 44:43.449
from the same source.

44:44.016 --> 44:46.084
The she-wolf is
motivated to protect

44:46.085 --> 44:47.753
and nurture the helpless.

44:48.119 --> 44:51.355
When she rises up and
changes from wolf to human,

44:51.356 --> 44:54.625
she has a rational side
and a kind, gentle heart

44:54.626 --> 44:56.795
that cares and loves.

44:57.295 --> 45:00.131
Contrary, the scream
queens transmutation

45:00.132 --> 45:01.966
from human to wolf,

45:01.967 --> 45:06.270
or better yet demon,
loses all reason, purpose,

45:06.271 --> 45:07.538
and compassion.

45:07.539 --> 45:09.441
Even if that is true,
she would never hurt me.

45:09.442 --> 45:10.841
We have feelings
for one another.

45:10.842 --> 45:12.576
She might have
feelings for you,

45:12.577 --> 45:14.913
but the beast does not.

45:14.914 --> 45:17.383
Why are you saying beast?
She's absolutely beautiful.

45:17.384 --> 45:19.951
The belladonna
plant is beautiful.

45:19.952 --> 45:23.422
It's also the deadliest plant
in the Northern hemisphere.

45:23.956 --> 45:25.556
Say that it is true.

45:25.557 --> 45:28.026
What could make her
change? A full moon?

45:28.027 --> 45:30.595
This is not a horror
movie, Mr. Bubar.

45:30.596 --> 45:31.996
It's reality.

45:32.565 --> 45:33.864
I don't understand.

45:33.865 --> 45:36.068
Every she-wolf
has their trigger.

45:36.635 --> 45:37.970
It's ingrained at a young age

45:37.971 --> 45:40.705
and when that trigger is
pulled, no one is safe.

45:40.706 --> 45:41.606
So, you're telling me that,

45:41.607 --> 45:43.641
Be cautious, Mr. Bubar.

45:44.510 --> 45:45.544
Rem?

45:48.614 --> 45:50.316
Show Mr. Bubar out.

46:17.275 --> 46:20.278
I cannot believe he's in
love with her. It's not fair!

46:21.847 --> 46:23.249
Bellisima.

46:25.217 --> 46:27.384
Why does Gina get to walk
in the world of gardens

46:27.385 --> 46:28.920
that I write about?

46:30.021 --> 46:32.090
Do you think
I love her more than you?

46:40.699 --> 46:42.701
Will Gina ever come home?

46:46.505 --> 46:48.073
I don't know.

47:03.688 --> 47:05.391
I must get back to work.

47:48.367 --> 47:49.634
Say the secret
word and the girl

47:49.635 --> 47:51.270
of your dreams will appear.

48:53.565 --> 48:55.400
Let's get nasty.

49:16.956 --> 49:19.057
The heart becomes
salvage, Mr. Bubar.

49:20.659 --> 49:22.695
The heart becomes
salvage.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.613
I spent
the next two days

49:43.614 --> 49:45.416
interviewing Lonzo's crew.

49:46.085 --> 49:48.420
I was astonished at
how happy they all were

49:49.054 --> 49:50.388
given the fact that most of them

49:50.389 --> 49:52.691
lived just above
the poverty level.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.530
Just a creepy old car,
Jake. No big deal. Right?

50:02.400 --> 50:04.068
What a creepy old car.

50:07.639 --> 50:08.807
Harry?

50:09.307 --> 50:10.208
Yeah?

50:11.143 --> 50:12.043
I'm Jake.

50:12.044 --> 50:13.378
Have a seat, Jake.

50:18.483 --> 50:19.485
Would you like some?

50:20.885 --> 50:22.720
I'm good.

50:22.721 --> 50:24.389
I've already eaten
lunch, but thank you.

50:26.925 --> 50:28.727
Ya know, at first,

50:29.128 --> 50:30.729
I didn't like sardines.

50:31.063 --> 50:33.163
I didn't even like
the name sardines,

50:33.164 --> 50:34.867
especially the way they smelled.

50:37.735 --> 50:40.204
I'm sorry. Takes a
while to get used to.

50:40.672 --> 50:43.140
But when you do,
they're like a woman.

50:43.141 --> 50:44.643
You can't get enough.

50:44.943 --> 50:47.312
And you always want more,
you know what I'm sayin'?

50:49.148 --> 50:51.784
I actually just have
a couple questions.

50:52.317 --> 50:54.151
On the last day
of Lonzo's shoot,

50:54.152 --> 50:56.754
you were the one to put
away the equipment, right?

50:57.655 --> 50:59.357
Yeah, I was there but,

50:59.358 --> 51:01.225
Mr. Lonzo told me
to leave early.

51:01.226 --> 51:03.528
So you weren't
the last one to leave?

51:03.996 --> 51:05.130
No.

51:06.197 --> 51:08.598
Ya know, after
one of our shoots,

51:08.599 --> 51:11.804
Mr. Lonzo gave me
two whole cases.

51:12.336 --> 51:13.437
He couldn't pay us

51:13.438 --> 51:15.172
'cause the distributors
check bounced.

51:15.173 --> 51:17.409
And he wanted to make sure
we got enough protein.

51:18.210 --> 51:19.377
You know how much
protein there is

51:19.378 --> 51:21.246
in one can of sardines?

51:21.579 --> 51:22.780
No.

51:23.081 --> 51:25.784
More than three
whole steaks. Yes sir.

51:27.385 --> 51:31.156
I love that guy. He cares so
much about the little people.

51:31.757 --> 51:32.958
You sure you don't want any?

51:33.291 --> 51:34.625
I, I'm okay.

51:34.626 --> 51:35.993
I'm okay, thanks.

51:35.994 --> 51:38.363
Put hair on your chest.
Lead in your pencil.

51:38.364 --> 51:42.732
Actually, I think
that's all I need but,

51:42.733 --> 51:43.968
it was great meeting you.

51:43.969 --> 51:45.535
Thank you so much
for meeting with me.

51:45.536 --> 51:46.471
Take care.

51:46.472 --> 51:47.439
You too.

51:50.708 --> 51:51.609
Yeah.

52:20.606 --> 52:22.341
Miss Bell?

52:24.208 --> 52:25.676
Call me Flame.

52:27.012 --> 52:28.212
Hi, I'm Jake.

52:28.213 --> 52:30.082
I know. The guy
from the magazine?

52:30.083 --> 52:31.281
That's right.

52:31.282 --> 52:32.183
I hope you don't
mind if I continue

52:32.184 --> 52:33.651
my workout while we talk.

52:33.652 --> 52:35.586
Otherwise, I'll
never get it done.

52:36.221 --> 52:37.655
No, of course.

52:38.489 --> 52:41.024
I hope these questions
aren't gonna be too personal.

52:41.025 --> 52:42.727
I got interviewed once by a guy

52:42.728 --> 52:44.562
pretending to be
from a magazine.

52:44.563 --> 52:46.898
He turned out to
be some pervert.

52:47.331 --> 52:48.500
What happened?

52:48.699 --> 52:50.201
I dropped a bar
bell on his crotch.

52:51.402 --> 52:52.336
Last I heard, he
became a candidate

52:52.337 --> 52:53.905
for a sex change operation.

52:55.806 --> 52:59.644
Don't worry. You have
nothing to be afraid of.

53:00.512 --> 53:03.382
Besides, you're kinda cute.

53:04.215 --> 53:05.583
Do you have a girlfriend?

53:05.784 --> 53:07.619
What?

53:08.719 --> 53:09.820
Rawr.

53:11.389 --> 53:14.792
It's okay. I can handle it.

53:18.297 --> 53:19.798
Hey, can you do me a favor?

53:19.799 --> 53:21.199
Sure, if I can.

53:21.666 --> 53:24.100
I wanna make sure I'm
doing really good push ups.

53:24.101 --> 53:26.671
So, can you just put your hand

53:26.672 --> 53:29.374
on the floor and make sure my
chest touches it each time?

53:29.942 --> 53:31.341
The floor?

53:31.342 --> 53:34.245
No, silly, your hand.

53:40.485 --> 53:42.752
What did I do in
my life to deserve

53:42.753 --> 53:45.288
to be subjected to these
thoughts and images

53:45.289 --> 53:47.159
that torture my young soul?

53:48.159 --> 53:50.393
Even Buddha got to touch
more tit than this.

53:50.394 --> 53:53.230
I just see these films
as a stepping stone

53:53.231 --> 53:55.132
to my final career plateau.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.802
Well, what
is that plateau?

53:59.036 --> 54:00.871
Playboy magazine, of course.

54:04.509 --> 54:07.444
Can you be completely
honest with me?

54:07.445 --> 54:08.614
Sure.

54:08.914 --> 54:10.382
Tell me what you
think of these.

54:13.217 --> 54:15.920
I mean, do you think
they're Playboy material?

54:16.320 --> 54:19.324
I can do this. I can do this.

54:20.259 --> 54:21.559
I can do this.

54:21.927 --> 54:23.127
I mean, they're
really n..., they look...

54:23.128 --> 54:24.096
Do you want to feel them?

54:30.802 --> 54:33.704
Actually, I just
had one question.

54:34.172 --> 54:35.840
Don't bother. They're real.

54:37.909 --> 54:39.576
That's not what
I was gonna ask but,

54:39.577 --> 54:40.578
good for you.

54:40.579 --> 54:41.780
Thank you.

54:42.813 --> 54:45.250
Why weren't you at
Lonzo's last wrap party?

54:47.152 --> 54:48.619
That's a weird question.

54:50.054 --> 54:51.289
I'll tell you

54:51.722 --> 54:53.659
but then I'm gonna
have to kill you.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.359
What?

54:55.827 --> 54:58.297
I'm only kidding.

54:59.331 --> 55:00.363
It's okay.

55:00.364 --> 55:01.832
So anyway.

55:01.967 --> 55:04.535
I've had to make a wee wee
for like an hour and a half

55:04.536 --> 55:06.270
and I'm not leaving this room

55:06.271 --> 55:10.509
until I hear every single
detail of that story.

55:11.242 --> 55:14.078
If I gotta piss in
my pants, so be it.

55:14.079 --> 55:14.980
Okay.

55:14.981 --> 55:16.212
I'll tell you everything.

55:16.213 --> 55:18.181
But I swear to God, if
you pee on my floor,

55:18.182 --> 55:19.885
I'm never talking to you again.

55:20.117 --> 55:21.052
Okay.

55:21.820 --> 55:23.255
You got any more chips?

55:24.422 --> 55:26.857
I was down to the
last person on Gina's list.

55:26.858 --> 55:28.960
An old timer named
Charlie Graves.

55:30.329 --> 55:31.697
Mr. Graves?

55:31.896 --> 55:32.596
Youngblood.

55:32.597 --> 55:33.265
Hi.

55:33.266 --> 55:34.266
Have a seat.

55:34.267 --> 55:35.367
Thank you.

55:38.670 --> 55:40.605
Here, take a look at that.

55:43.608 --> 55:44.774
Is that you?

55:44.775 --> 55:46.243
I was a handsome
devil, wasn't I?

55:47.346 --> 55:51.516
Mr. Graves, is that Thomas
Edison in the picture with you?

55:54.152 --> 55:56.319
Exactly how long have
you been in the business?

55:56.320 --> 55:57.456
Not long enough.

55:58.289 --> 55:59.391
I still have a few

56:00.025 --> 56:01.827
purty movies left in me but,

56:03.027 --> 56:04.862
I don't know if I'm gonna last.

56:06.630 --> 56:08.299
Until I get some.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.034
Unless what?

56:11.135 --> 56:13.938
I get some young!

56:21.980 --> 56:25.483
Yeah, funny.

56:26.083 --> 56:27.652
I didn't scare you
too much, did I?

56:28.286 --> 56:31.056
No. Not at all.

56:31.456 --> 56:34.459
It's alright, kid. We're
all scared of something.

56:35.427 --> 56:36.628
Fear.

56:37.161 --> 56:39.263
It lets you know you're
alive and makes your

56:39.264 --> 56:41.633
heart race and your blood pump.

56:42.266 --> 56:44.368
It's the next best thing to sex.

56:44.369 --> 56:47.672
Why do you think so many people
watch scary movies?

56:48.507 --> 56:50.642
I guess I never
thought of it that way.

56:51.376 --> 56:53.412
When you've been around
as long as I've been,

56:53.911 --> 56:57.448
you see things a whole new way.

56:58.516 --> 57:01.619
One's vision and take
on things become clear.

57:07.125 --> 57:10.796
-Can I ask you one last question?
-Go right ahead, young blood.

57:11.862 --> 57:14.432
Is there such a thing
as a true scream queen?

57:14.900 --> 57:16.168
Where did you hear that?

57:16.668 --> 57:18.470
Who told you about that?

57:20.938 --> 57:21.940
Where did you hear that?

57:22.407 --> 57:23.542
I just heard some people.

57:23.543 --> 57:25.509
Now, that's some bullshit.

57:28.346 --> 57:29.747
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57:29.748 --> 57:31.349
I'll answer your question.

57:32.483 --> 57:33.951
It's a myth.

57:36.487 --> 57:37.422
But I thought.

57:37.423 --> 57:38.990
But that's all I got to say.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.293
It's a myth.

57:45.730 --> 57:47.865
Well, thank you very
much for meeting with me.

57:48.666 --> 57:50.268
I appreciate you
taking the time.

57:52.804 --> 57:54.004
It was nice meeting you.

57:54.005 --> 57:56.141
And remember one
thing, young blood.

57:57.275 --> 57:59.744
Charlie Graves doesn't lie.

58:04.916 --> 58:06.084
It's a myth.

58:09.353 --> 58:10.588
It's a myth.

01:00:37.702 --> 01:00:38.835
My God.

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:39.637
That was the
best fun of my day.

01:00:39.638 --> 01:00:40.703
It was awesome!

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:43.974
My God.

01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:48.746
I have, I have the best
time when I'm with you.

01:00:49.014 --> 01:00:49.948
Me too.

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:51.582
With yourself?

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:52.951
No, with you.

01:00:53.952 --> 01:00:56.488
Dumb actress. Can't
do stuff like that.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.232
It's Lonzo.

01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:10.702
Hey.

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:15.606
No, please don't say
that. It's not over.

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:17.741
That's a wrap.

01:01:18.677 --> 01:01:19.977
Lonzo, please, just trust me.

01:01:19.978 --> 01:01:21.246
We'll get it figured out.

01:01:22.514 --> 01:01:23.381
Yes, we will.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:28.920
Hello?

01:01:37.896 --> 01:01:39.330
I'm so sorry.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.400
What?

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:45.135
I let you down.

01:01:46.771 --> 01:01:48.406
You didn't let me down.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.875
You're crazy.

01:01:51.543 --> 01:01:53.576
You're the only person that
I've ever known in my life

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.746
that would risk their
own safety for me.

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.248
That's pretty awesome.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.740
I'm sorry.

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:24.674
I shouldn't have done that.

01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:25.809
Yeah, you shouldn't have.

01:02:26.478 --> 01:02:28.680
I love this art work.

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:32.282
Yeah.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.952
It's always about good box art.

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:37.154
Not when you're in them.

01:02:39.657 --> 01:02:41.860
You really are a fan?

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:46.697
Hey.

01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:50.399
Who's Tony Boca and why
haven't we checked him out?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.568
Tony

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:53.569
produced a bunch
of Lonzo's movies

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:55.439
back in the day and

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.672
kinda got bored with
it all, I think.

01:02:56.673 --> 01:02:59.409
He retired and he
owns car washes now.

01:02:59.978 --> 01:03:02.146
Well, we have to follow
up with every suspect.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.913
Not that guy.

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:05.415
No way. Forget about it.

01:03:05.416 --> 01:03:08.086
He grew up with Lonzo.
They were best friends.

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:09.887
He would never hurt him.

01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:11.722
Well, who else is left?

01:03:13.724 --> 01:03:14.992
Doesn't hurt, right?

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:20.798
His place is like two
miles down the road.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:47.659
Lonzo!

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.060
That was his car.

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:53.530
Lonzo! Lonzo.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:56.166
Lonzo!

01:03:56.601 --> 01:03:57.868
Lonzo.

01:03:57.869 --> 01:03:59.537
Little late for a car
wash, don't ya think?

01:03:59.871 --> 01:04:01.773
Why would you do this to
him? He was your friend.

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.006
He cut me off
for no good reason.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.576
No. You retired.

01:04:05.577 --> 01:04:07.444
No, no.
He got rid of me.

01:04:07.445 --> 01:04:08.680
This business
is full of rejection.

01:04:08.681 --> 01:04:10.446
You, of all people,
should know that.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:12.549
I can't believe you're
talkin' to me like that.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:13.651
Why don't
you just let him go,

01:04:13.652 --> 01:04:15.785
you dumb fucking grease monkey?

01:04:15.786 --> 01:04:17.087
That a nice thing to be saying

01:04:17.088 --> 01:04:18.389
to a guy with a gun?

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.124
Watch it. Put that back.

01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:23.292
Real tough guy now
when you have a gun?

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:26.763
I don't need a gun for
a two bit scream queen.

01:04:26.764 --> 01:04:28.131
Two bit.

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:31.536
I'm number one scream
queen, ya fucking jerk off.

01:04:33.438 --> 01:04:34.605
I'm gonna feel a
lot better knowing

01:04:34.606 --> 01:04:37.040
I killed a number
one scream queen

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:38.743
rather than a number two.

01:04:38.744 --> 01:04:40.911
Just do it, you dickless fuck.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:44.014
Myth or no myth, please work.

01:04:44.849 --> 01:04:46.616
Jake!

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:48.118
Now that you have become

01:04:48.119 --> 01:04:50.021
what you have become,

01:04:50.621 --> 01:04:53.390
it is best that you go
back to your country.

01:04:54.659 --> 01:04:57.261
And leave Transylvania forever!

01:04:57.262 --> 01:04:59.430
Who the fuck are
you supposed to be?

01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:01.031
I am Dracula.

01:05:05.003 --> 01:05:06.303
Ahaha.

01:05:06.304 --> 01:05:07.870
Put your hands down.

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:10.607
Get down on the floor. I'm
gonna cut her heart out.

01:05:10.608 --> 01:05:14.243
Listen to them, the
children of the night.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.345
What the?

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:16.779
What music they make.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.416
Are you kidding me?

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:24.989
As the spider spins the
web for the unworthy fly.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:15.132
Gina? Gina? Is
that really you?

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.635
Gina. Gina, what
are you doing?

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.342
Now we can fuck!

01:07:28.112 --> 01:07:29.113
Okay.

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:35.318
I can't.

01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:39.323
I can't!

01:07:50.001 --> 01:07:51.035
No.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.874
You had me going there.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.842
That was good. I
was with you there.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.445
You're good.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.448
You're good.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:04.980
I swear it's all true.

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:06.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:09.219
Hey listen, thanks
for the food, man.

01:08:10.221 --> 01:08:11.855
You should write
that bullshit down.

01:08:11.856 --> 01:08:14.559
I mean, I didn't believe
you but, pretty good story.

01:08:14.926 --> 01:08:16.426
Might make a good
movie or something.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.395
Call ya tomorrow.
We'll get some beers.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.331
Keep it gay.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.474
What'd you forget?

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:33.143
Gina?

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.692
It's over.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:50.394
It's over!

01:08:51.028 --> 01:08:53.731
Hey, that was a
damn good movie.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.867
It's a crossover
film for sure!

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:57.434
I thought it sucked.

01:08:57.702 --> 01:08:59.569
An overnight success
that took 15 years.

01:08:59.571 --> 01:09:00.737
Am I right, Eddie?

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.471
I thought it sucked.

01:09:06.944 --> 01:09:08.178
I really love the part
where the whipped cream

01:09:08.179 --> 01:09:09.246
got cleaned off.

01:09:09.247 --> 01:09:10.412
You would.

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:11.848
Hey, what are
you trying to say?

01:09:11.849 --> 01:09:12.948
You got a problem with that?

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.251
Go eat a sardine.

01:09:14.252 --> 01:09:16.519
Fabulous idea.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.720
I smell like fish
'cause I love sardines.

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.090
What's your excuse?

01:09:20.091 --> 01:09:21.291
Asshole.

01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:23.193
Hey Ed, what's taking
Rufus and Lillian

01:09:23.194 --> 01:09:25.763
so long to get back
with the champagne?

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.296
Probably having sex.

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:30.268
That's disgusting.

01:09:30.635 --> 01:09:31.968
Not when I do it, baby.

01:09:31.969 --> 01:09:33.502
Asshole.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.037
Guys, take it easy. This is
supposed to be a celebration.

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.774
Fabulous idea.

01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:39.676
Hey Ed.

01:10:10.173 --> 01:10:11.309
Everybody!

01:10:13.077 --> 01:10:15.913
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

01:10:30.461 --> 01:10:32.762
Eddie, what are you
doing? Are you crazy?

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:39.202
No. I'm just a
psychopathic producer.

01:10:40.371 --> 01:10:42.405
What's goin' on? Are
you feelin' alright?

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:46.076
I'm feeling fine.

01:10:46.344 --> 01:10:47.612
Okay.

01:10:47.712 --> 01:10:51.081
And by the way, Julia,
you sucked in the movie.

01:10:51.082 --> 01:10:54.117
You couldn't act your
way out of a paper bag.

01:10:54.118 --> 01:10:55.385
Alright.

01:10:55.386 --> 01:10:57.221
Quit kidding, Eddie.
We're all friends here.

01:10:57.688 --> 01:10:59.023
Friends.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.224
Good point.

01:11:02.193 --> 01:11:03.360
Leo,

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.430
please come here and
help out a friend.

01:11:06.631 --> 01:11:07.565
Yeah, okay.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:16.806
Anything else, Eddie?

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:19.408
You really like the
movie, didn't you?

01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:20.810
Yeah! I loved it.

01:11:21.412 --> 01:11:22.879
That's great.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.617
That's really, really great!

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:34.824
I guess that's a cut.

01:11:35.826 --> 01:11:37.427
That's not funny, Eddie.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:40.296
This is all bullshit.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:42.898
Now, wake up that jerk off
and let's have a party.

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:43.967
Fine.

01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:48.072
You're right. He is a jerk off.

01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:50.507
Why don't you wake him up?

01:11:51.509 --> 01:11:52.576
I will.

01:11:59.984 --> 01:12:01.318
Hey, moron!

01:12:01.319 --> 01:12:02.887
Get the hell off the floor.

01:12:06.957 --> 01:12:09.393
Hey. This'll wake him up.

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:19.969
He must be wearing a cup.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.378
Having a little trouble?

01:12:35.219 --> 01:12:38.922
You can never find a
PA when you need one.

01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:42.827
My God, he really is dead!

01:13:15.993 --> 01:13:17.695
Did I really
suck in the movie?

01:13:17.696 --> 01:13:19.829
Are you kidding?
You're amazing.

01:13:28.506 --> 01:13:29.840
Go, go, go.

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:35.812
Come on, come
on, come on! Hurry!

01:13:35.813 --> 01:13:38.181
Here, hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:39.916
Hurry!

01:13:41.519 --> 01:13:42.652
My God.

01:13:42.653 --> 01:13:45.554
What the hell happened to Eddie?

01:13:45.555 --> 01:13:47.322
Eddie's completely lost it.

01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:48.259
No shit.

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.692
Listen, he's just got a knife.

01:13:49.693 --> 01:13:50.894
There's a bunch of us. Why
don't we just jump him?

01:13:50.895 --> 01:13:51.695
Yeah, okay.

01:13:51.696 --> 01:13:52.762
We need a plan.

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:53.923
Eddie?

01:15:15.145 --> 01:15:17.948
Julia? Julia?

01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:20.351
Julia!

01:15:35.533 --> 01:15:38.903
Shit.

01:15:45.509 --> 01:15:46.609
Julia.

01:15:48.045 --> 01:15:51.081
Tim. I thought you left me.

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:54.684
You alright?

01:15:56.086 --> 01:15:57.555
Come on. I wouldn't leave you.

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:00.456
Are you okay?

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:01.858
Are you okay?

01:16:03.493 --> 01:16:04.961
Listen, Eddie's still out there.

01:16:04.962 --> 01:16:06.931
So we have to wait it out here.

01:16:06.932 --> 01:16:08.331
No.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.537
Come on, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

01:16:14.238 --> 01:16:15.837
He's never
done this before.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:16.774
Stop.

01:16:16.775 --> 01:16:18.206
I love you.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:19.777
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, alright?

01:16:54.478 --> 01:16:55.813
Would you like a sardine?

01:16:57.948 --> 01:16:58.983
Yeah.

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:01.818
Thanks.

01:17:07.858 --> 01:17:08.858
Tired?

01:17:08.859 --> 01:17:10.194
Yeah, a little bit.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.930
Killing people is
harder than it looks.

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:38.689
How 'bout a snort of this?

01:17:45.695 --> 01:17:48.764
Hahahahaha. The
hair of the dog.

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:50.500
Just what I needed.

01:17:58.509 --> 01:17:59.643
Would you like a napkin?

01:17:59.943 --> 01:18:01.145
Yeah, you got one?

01:18:03.881 --> 01:18:05.783
I thought I did.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.422
Julia.

01:18:18.429 --> 01:18:20.831
Julia?

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:23.433
Julia! Julia!

01:18:23.434 --> 01:18:24.068
Tim!

01:18:24.069 --> 01:18:26.970
Julia!

01:18:27.237 --> 01:18:28.204
Look!

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.248
Douchebag.

01:18:43.087 --> 01:18:43.987
Come on.

01:18:44.688 --> 01:18:45.889
Come on, come on.

01:18:48.158 --> 01:18:49.224
Can't go that fast.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.193
Wait, wait.

01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:52.796
Shit!

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:07.176
Tim!

01:20:12.109 --> 01:20:14.111
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.279
Shit.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.880
Ring around the rosie.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:20.983
Pocket full of spinners!

01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:23.051
Going so soon?

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:26.489
Why, my little party's
just beginning!

01:20:27.591 --> 01:20:28.759
Come on. Come on!

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:40.903
Top of the world,
Ma! Top of the world!

01:20:58.822 --> 01:20:59.989
You okay?

01:21:02.326 --> 01:21:04.694
It's great to
have an audience.

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:08.564
I'm ready for my
closeup, Mr. DeMille.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.540
Hey guys. You like it?

01:21:17.541 --> 01:21:19.676
I got it at K-Mart.

01:21:29.519 --> 01:21:31.922
Come out, come
out, wherever you.

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:36.960
They're coming for you, Barbara.

01:21:39.462 --> 01:21:43.766
Look! There's one of them now!

01:21:45.735 --> 01:21:47.270
Tim, get up! Tim!

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:48.837
Tim, get up.

01:21:48.838 --> 01:21:50.273
Get up!

01:21:50.274 --> 01:21:52.209
Fuck, he's coming.
Come on, get up!

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:55.011
Get up!

01:21:58.881 --> 01:21:59.949
Go! Julia, go!

01:22:01.385 --> 01:22:03.685
There comes a time
in every man's life

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.787
when he must take
the bull by the horns

01:22:05.788 --> 01:22:08.056
and face the situation.

01:22:08.057 --> 01:22:10.193
I can't. Just
go get the police.

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:18.634
Fuckin' sick bastard.

01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:23.707
Fuckin' sick bastard!

01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:30.079
Come on baby. Come on, baby!

01:22:30.413 --> 01:22:32.648
Chainsaw, don't fail me now!

01:22:38.622 --> 01:22:40.589
By placing my hands so,

01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:43.193
I can crush your
head like a walnut.

01:22:47.029 --> 01:22:48.398
Let him go, Eddie.

01:22:51.335 --> 01:22:52.802
I said let him go!

01:22:53.904 --> 01:22:55.339
He's gone, Julia.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:57.773
He believes he's Lonzo, the
character from the movie.

01:22:58.007 --> 01:23:00.777
His mind is just a bunch
of celluloid clips!

01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:03.746
How is that even possible?

01:23:03.747 --> 01:23:06.615
He believes it with
every fiber of his being.

01:23:08.551 --> 01:23:10.286
Well, I can believe too.

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:12.154
You mean?

01:23:13.724 --> 01:23:18.028
I said I can believe too.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.497
Fools!

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:23.532
Do you think you can
kill me with your

01:23:23.533 --> 01:23:25.867
crucifixes and your wolfs bane?

01:23:25.868 --> 01:23:29.238
I have centuries behind me!

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:31.875
Yeah. Do it.

01:23:32.676 --> 01:23:35.810
Your blood now flows
through our veins.

01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:38.881
Kill the brain and
you kill the ghoul.

01:23:39.783 --> 01:23:41.218
Yeah. Do it.

01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:43.051
Keep going.

01:23:43.052 --> 01:23:44.987
Ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies.

01:23:44.988 --> 01:23:46.121
Keep going!

01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:48.524
Crazy, am I? We'll
see who's crazy.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.630
It's alive! It's
alive! It's alive!

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:56.699
Leave it alone,
Fritz. Leave it alone.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:00.804
Do it.

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:04.306
And then was
acknowledged the presence

01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:09.279
of the red death.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.393
Mother of mercy.

01:24:24.394 --> 01:24:26.596
Is this the end of Draco?

01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:55.791
Holy shit.

01:24:58.161 --> 01:24:59.628
You are a true scream queen.

01:25:04.734 --> 01:25:05.836
God, I love you.

01:25:13.743 --> 01:25:14.711
Julia?

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:18.981
Julia, it's me.

01:25:20.417 --> 01:25:22.352
Julia? Snap out of it.

01:25:22.853 --> 01:25:24.753
Julia? Julia!

01:25:45.408 --> 01:25:47.475
Gina darling.

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:50.345
I'm truly sorry about
the Scorsese project but,

01:25:50.346 --> 01:25:52.281
you do understand.

01:25:52.282 --> 01:25:54.049
It's the nature of the business.

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:57.286
I do and it's alright.

01:25:57.287 --> 01:25:58.754
Don't worry about it.

01:25:58.755 --> 01:25:59.956
Gina, wait.

01:26:01.158 --> 01:26:03.026
Forget that I'm your
agent for a moment.

01:26:03.027 --> 01:26:05.361
I forgot that weeks ago.

01:26:05.362 --> 01:26:07.929
Hahahaha, you say that now.

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:10.532
But, since your last
picture was released,

01:26:10.533 --> 01:26:12.468
my phone rings off the hook

01:26:12.469 --> 01:26:13.969
morning, noon, and night.

01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:15.970
They're begging for you, Gina.

01:26:15.971 --> 01:26:17.739
Not just these little
independent producers

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.241
from all these little
shitty pictures.

01:26:19.242 --> 01:26:21.510
I mean Hollywood.
I mean big budget.

01:26:21.511 --> 01:26:23.812
I mean major
producers, major stars,

01:26:23.813 --> 01:26:25.547
and you in all the lead roles.

01:26:25.548 --> 01:26:26.515
Money.

01:26:26.516 --> 01:26:28.717
Don't you understand?

01:26:29.452 --> 01:26:31.252
You can write your
ticket anywhere.

01:26:31.253 --> 01:26:33.455
Don't you understand?

01:26:33.456 --> 01:26:36.592
I don't wanna do
horror films anymore!

01:26:36.993 --> 01:26:38.662
God damn it, Tess.

01:26:39.095 --> 01:26:42.096
I don't believe
that for one second.

01:26:42.097 --> 01:26:43.265
You don't believe it.

01:26:44.067 --> 01:26:45.800
What was the line
in that one movie?

01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:47.236
It suits you perfectly.

01:26:47.237 --> 01:26:48.171
No, don't do it. Don't
even think about doing it.

01:26:48.172 --> 01:26:49.539
No, I think I know what it is.

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.572
What was that line?

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:51.773
Tess, don't!

01:26:51.774 --> 01:26:53.408
It was made for
you. I love that line.

01:26:53.409 --> 01:26:54.778
Got it!

01:26:55.278 --> 01:26:57.011
No, do not say it.

01:26:57.012 --> 01:26:59.916
You are a true scream queen.
