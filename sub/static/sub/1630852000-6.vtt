<b><i>Take it in, breathe it out</i></b>

00:15.220 --> 00:19.220
<b><i>A little drum that's beating loud</i></b>

00:21.640 --> 00:26.100
<b><i>In my chest, I hear the sound</i></b>

01:56.800 --> 01:58.970
<b>Of a penthouse apartment? Unlikely.</b>

01:59.300 --> 02:00.850
<b><i>Unlikely?</i></b>

02:01.160 --> 02:04.640
<b><i>Like one of Wallace's skin jobs
going on a murder spree?</i></b>

02:04.640 --> 02:06.990
<b><i>You wanna bet my life
on how unlikely that is?</i></b>

02:06.990 --> 02:09.720
<b>Get to the bedroom.
Lock the door.</b>

02:09.720 --> 02:10.890
<b>I'm on my way.</b>

02:11.430 --> 02:12.710

<b>Marlowe.</b>

05:16.330 --> 05:18.200
<b>You look like hell, Joseph.</b>

05:19.330 --> 05:21.190
<b>Been through hell, Marlowe.</b>

05:23.000 --> 05:24.750
<b>Yeah, I bet you have.</b>

05:24.750 --> 05:27.210
<b>What have you got yourself mixed up in now?</b>

05:33.400 --> 05:34.560
<b>We're clearing out.</b>

05:34.990 --> 05:36.680
<b>Not gonna find anything here.</b>

05:40.030 --> 05:42.180
<b>Good seeing you again.</b>

05:48.540 --> 05:49.730
<b>Shit.</b>

06:00.620 --> 06:03.340
<b><i>Meet me in my condo. Now.</i></b>

06:03.780 --> 06:05.290
<b>Uh, why?</b>

06:05.290 --> 06:08.580
<b><i>Because the skin job might be after my wife.</i></b>

06:08.580 --> 06:09.770
<b><i>Don't ask me why.</i></b>

07:25.660 --> 07:28.050
<b>Where are those useless...</b>

07:38.410 --> 07:39.300
<b>No.</b>

07:43.210 --> 07:43.770
<b>You.</b>

08:08.890 --> 08:10.100
<b>Wait!</b>

08:10.390 --> 08:11.840
<b>Don't hurt me.</b>

08:11.840 --> 08:13.060
<b>Please.</b>

08:25.910 --> 08:28.750
<b>The doll hunt wasn't my husband's idea!</b>

08:29.760 --> 08:32.330
<b>And I only went along to make him happy.</b>

08:32.770 --> 08:34.710
<b>I wasn't part of it.</b>

08:34.710 --> 08:36.890
<b>I don't even like hunting!</b>

08:36.890 --> 08:38.680
<b>I was only there as a spectator.</b>

08:39.820 --> 08:40.520
<b>Please.</b>

08:41.070 --> 08:43.380
<b>I'm a good person.</b>

08:43.380 --> 08:45.510
<b>I would never hurt anyone.</b>

08:49.680 --> 08:51.020
<b>I was there.</b>

08:52.130 --> 08:54.290
<b>I remember what you did.</b>

08:59.070 --> 09:00.010
<b>Do you?</b>

09:01.710 --> 09:03.790
<b>Replicant memories...</b>

09:04.670 --> 09:06.920
<b>are mostly fake in the first place.</b>

09:08.110 --> 09:10.740
<b>What makes you think this "Doll Hunt"</b>

09:10.740 --> 09:13.280
<b>is any more true than the rest of your past?</b>

09:14.000 --> 09:15.860
<b>How do you even know it happened?</b>

09:21.990 --> 09:24.600
<b>Who came up with the idea?</b>

09:24.600 --> 09:25.980
<b>Was it your husband?</b>

09:26.250 --> 09:26.870
<b>No.</b>

09:27.540 --> 09:29.480
<b>We were just guests.</b>

09:29.970 --> 09:33.120
<b>I--I don't know whose idea it was.</b>

09:34.380 --> 09:36.260
<b>Who invited you?</b>

09:43.470 --> 09:44.980
<b>A friend of my husband's.</b>

09:47.940 --> 09:49.150
<b>Name.</b>

09:51.980 --> 09:53.570
<b>So you can kill him?</b>

10:01.580 --> 10:03.790
<b>I only saw a small group.</b>

10:04.580 --> 10:07.270
<b>If there were others, I 
don't know about them.</b>

10:07.270 --> 10:08.170
<b>I swear.</b>

10:08.170 --> 10:10.250
<b>I want names. Now.</b>

10:17.220 --> 10:21.050
<b>Besides us, Senator Bannister.</b>

10:21.520 --> 10:23.520
<b>There was a journalist. Hooper.</b>

10:24.360 --> 10:26.650
<b>And my husband's friend, Dr. M.</b>

10:33.980 --> 10:35.990
<b>Where can I find Dr. M?</b>

10:38.780 --> 10:40.160
<b>I don't know.</b>

10:41.660 --> 10:43.080
<b>Don't lie to me!</b>

10:43.080 --> 10:44.990
<b>I'm not, I swear.</b>

10:46.040 --> 10:48.160
<b>My husband didn't tell me.</b>

10:53.920 --> 10:57.460
<b>Call him.
Tell him to come home.</b>

10:58.420 --> 10:59.590
<b>I can't.</b>

10:59.590 --> 11:02.030
<b>He's on duty. Unreachable.</b>

11:04.890 --> 11:06.780
<b>Lying's not gonna help.</b>

11:16.970 --> 11:17.870
<b>Sherman.</b>

11:19.390 --> 11:20.370
<b>York.</b>

11:24.050 --> 11:26.060
<b>Marlowe, you copy?</b>

11:26.650 --> 11:27.720
<b>Marlowe?</b>

11:28.450 --> 11:29.590
<b>You copy?</b>

11:31.830 --> 11:32.910
<b>Damn it.</b>

11:42.040 --> 11:44.890
<b>Home? But why?</b>

11:44.890 --> 11:46.820
<b>I'm no threat to you,</b>

11:46.820 --> 11:48.580
<b>so, please, put the gun down.</b>

11:49.440 --> 11:51.350
<b>I want answers.</b>

11:52.200 --> 11:54.320
<b>Whose idea was the Doll Hunt?</b>

11:54.780 --> 11:56.850
<b>I told you, I don't know!</b>

11:59.830 --> 12:00.990
<b>You're lying.</b>

12:10.120 --> 12:13.530
<b>Since my wife is still alive,</b>

12:13.530 --> 12:16.410
<b>should I assume you want something from me?</b>

12:17.760 --> 12:19.330
<b>I want your secrets.</b>

12:19.960 --> 12:21.660
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

12:22.130 --> 12:24.350
<b>Whose idea was the Doll Hunt?</b>

12:25.050 --> 12:27.680
<b>Don't know.
I never asked.</b>

12:29.680 --> 12:31.850
<b>You were invited to be part
of a mass murder,</b>

12:31.850 --> 12:33.490
<b>and you didn't have any questions?</b>

12:34.000 --> 12:36.270
<b>Murder? I'm a cop.</b>

12:36.270 --> 12:38.010
<b>I see murder every day.</b>

12:38.010 --> 12:41.320
<b>This was a rare opportunity.</b>

12:44.400 --> 12:45.860
<b>Opportunity?</b>

12:45.860 --> 12:47.170
<b>To hunt.</b>

12:48.240 --> 12:51.130
<b>My wife's family were 
hunters for generations,</b>

12:51.130 --> 12:53.430
<b>before the animals went extinct.</b>

12:53.430 --> 12:56.760
<b>Artificial ones are too 
expensive to shoot for sport.</b>

12:57.310 --> 12:59.420
<b>So you shoot people instead?</b>

12:59.420 --> 13:01.890
<b>Replicants, not people.</b>

13:02.370 --> 13:04.930
<b>Why should blade runners have all the fun?</b>

13:06.040 --> 13:07.400
<b>Blade runners?</b>

13:08.230 --> 13:11.920
<b>It's not even legal for 
things like you to exist.</b>

13:14.840 --> 13:16.320
<b>They were innocent.</b>

13:16.750 --> 13:19.450
<b>They couldn't even fight 
back, and you killed them.</b>

13:19.450 --> 13:21.210
<b>You made me a killer.</b>

13:21.880 --> 13:24.320
<b>All because you wanted to have fun?</b>

13:27.040 --> 13:28.790
<b>Hey, hey, there.</b>

13:28.790 --> 13:30.270
<b>Easy now.</b>

13:38.540 --> 13:43.130
<b>I just want to find a way for all of us 
to walk out of this alive.</b>

13:45.660 --> 13:47.960
<b>That's not what I want.</b>

13:48.330 --> 13:51.420
<b>What do you want? To kill us all?</b>

13:51.420 --> 13:56.360
<b>Everything that happened at the 
Doll Hunt and since, that's in the past.</b>

13:57.090 --> 13:59.980
<b>You need to start thinking about your future.</b>

14:01.990 --> 14:05.390
<b>You could have killed those 
officers, but you didn't.</b>

14:05.390 --> 14:08.440
<b>I think you made that choice for a reason.</b>

14:08.910 --> 14:11.530
<b>I don't think you wanna hurt anyone.</b>

14:11.530 --> 14:14.780
<b>It goes against everything 
you were built to be.</b>

14:14.780 --> 14:17.870
<b>Sure, you've gotten yourself 
into some serious trouble,</b>

14:17.870 --> 14:22.720
<b>but if you put that gun down, 
maybe I can help you.</b>

14:24.680 --> 14:25.800
<b>Why?</b>

14:26.540 --> 14:28.350
<b>I told you.</b>

14:28.350 --> 14:31.670
<b>I don't want anybody else to get hurt!</b>

14:37.240 --> 14:38.290
<b>Chief.</b>

14:54.920 --> 14:55.740
<b>Behind you!</b>

15:01.490 --> 15:03.330
<b>I don't believe it.</b>

15:23.580 --> 15:27.080
<b>You weren't supposed to be able to hurt us.</b>

15:32.200 --> 15:33.980
<b>A stupid doll...</b>

15:36.020 --> 15:39.290
<b>Who doesn't even have real feelings.</b>

15:48.600 --> 15:49.630
<b>Freeze!</b>

15:56.610 --> 15:58.090
<b>Black Lotus.</b>

15:59.520 --> 16:02.100
<b>Put the sword down.</b>

16:09.620 --> 16:12.560
<b>I'm done being hunted like an animal.</b>

16:15.750 --> 16:19.070
<b>You don't wanna be hunted, 
maybe you shouldn't be killing people.</b>

16:24.410 --> 16:26.320
<b>I'm not the one who started this.</b>

16:27.540 --> 16:29.450
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

16:45.230 --> 16:47.220
<b>Police! Drop your weapon!</b>

16:48.300 --> 16:51.010
<b>I'm a blade runner. She's mine.</b>

19:13.480 --> 19:15.180
<b>Don't!</b>

20:15.420 --> 20:17.560
<b><i>A stupid doll...</i></b>

20:19.490 --> 20:22.800
<b><i>Who doesn't even have real feelings.</i></b>

20:25.890 --> 20:28.080
<b>She said I don't have feelings.</b>

20:28.740 --> 20:30.420
<b>Not real ones.</b>

20:32.860 --> 20:34.320
<b>That my love...</b>

20:36.620 --> 20:39.190
<b>and my grief are just illusions.</b>

20:40.210 --> 20:41.850
<b>But if that's true...</b>

20:44.440 --> 20:46.690
<b>shouldn't revenge hurt less?</b>

21:14.420 --> 21:16.240
<b><i>Feeling like a dull knife</i></b>

21:16.240 --> 21:17.740
<b><i>Running from a past life</i></b>

21:17.740 --> 21:19.260
<b><i>Lookin' for you</i></b>

21:19.790 --> 21:22.770
<b><i>Hiding in plain sight</i></b>

21:22.770 --> 21:24.840
<b><i>Don't know if you are</i></b>

21:24.840 --> 21:27.040

<b><i>Cause evеry time you try to run away</i></b>

21:47.170 --> 21:49.940

21:49.940 --> 21:50.690
<b><i>Oh, no</i></b>

21:50.690 --> 21:53.980
