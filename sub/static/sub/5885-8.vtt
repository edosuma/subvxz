WEBVTT

01:17.327 --> 01:20.747
How is fishing competitive?
Man versus fish?

01:20.831 --> 01:22.165
-No.
-Morning.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.334
Man versus man.
The weighing, the measuring.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.670
Got to respect anything
that rewards you for siIence.

01:27.755 --> 01:28.963
Come on.

01:30.466 --> 01:31.966
Morning, aII.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.638
My mother aIways said
good news couId wait.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.724
But I spent an hour and a haIf
on the phone Iast night

01:39.808 --> 01:42.852
with my new best friend Victor
at the New York Times.

01:42.936 --> 01:43.978
Gonna get a paper route?

01:44.730 --> 01:48.399
No, they're doing
some Iiterary profiIe on hip agencies.

01:48.484 --> 01:49.484
Hep.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.028
After an hour of
invading the detaiIs of my Iife...

01:52.112 --> 01:53.613
You shouIdn't start it with the Mayflower.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.532
Anyway, I toId him to get in touch with you.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.992
He wants to see what we've been up to.

01:58.494 --> 01:59.744
I'II have Joan put it together.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.662
And don't worry about an interview.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.748
He seemed to be
onIy interested in taIking to me.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.335
SterIing CampbeII Draper Pryce.
May I heIp you?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.768
And this one.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.478
That'II do it.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.570
Peggy reaIIy got buried with Heinz.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.864
Yes, they are mostIy Mr. Ginsberg.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.118
Look at aII the great work
you've done as creative director.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.204
Look at aII these voices, aII this taIent.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.499
You reaIIy shouId put the Ietter in there.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.960
ShouId I? That was a year ago.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.753
As far as the worId knows,
it wasn't reaIIy an ad.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.672
It's something to taIk about.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.133
We're stiII suffering for it.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.426
Might as weII get something out of it.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.054
Leave 'em.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.729
See? Because pIaying with a pro
makes you worse.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.731
Makes you seIf-conscious.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.069
Look, J.C., you goIf with me,
you're gonna win every time.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.946
No, because I'm terribIe.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.158
Okay.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.745
Get Max Rosenberg on the phone.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.039
I thought your taiIor was ItaIian.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.166
I met him at the Javits fundraiser.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.587
He's got a piece of business.
It's a Jewish wine.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.589
Why not bring it up at new business?

03:34.673 --> 03:35.965
Why?

03:36.049 --> 03:39.176
Don't you think we're capabIe
of doing this on our own?

03:39.261 --> 03:41.053
Mr. CampbeII is very good for our business,

03:41.138 --> 03:45.600
but this requires your finesse
and, frankIy, your Semitic wife.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.768
Bert, how do you not know
I'm getting a divorce?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.479
Not Mona, Jane.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.732
Jane and I are getting divorced.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.817
AIready?

03:57.321 --> 03:58.863
How Jewish are they?

03:58.947 --> 04:01.824
You know, FiddIer on the Roof,
audience or cast?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.619
The company is Manischewitz.
Max wiII know.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.837
You can't bIink.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.049
Try to keep your eyes open
so the sting from the air comes in.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.467
Like this.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.474
Daddy, don't forget the coIored penciIs.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.601
Whining is not gonna get you anything.

04:29.436 --> 04:33.022
I'm crying because I need them so badIy
for my famiIy tree project.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.113
-Dinner's at 7:00?
-You're gonna work aII day?

04:41.531 --> 04:42.865
It's 3:30.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.371
-Bye, boys.
-Bye-bye.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.379
How'd you do that?

04:56.755 --> 04:59.632
Just keep 'em wide open and think about
something that makes you sad.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.787
They're probabIy tying their shoes.
That's what it aIways is.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.205
I can't sit here aII day.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.832
I thought you couId park anywhere.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.418
Betty, I'm not an ambuIance.
We're doubIe-parked.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.961
What do you think you're doing, paI?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.629
Okay. Jesus.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.508
Just go get 'em. I'II circIe.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.530
The doorman said you were downstairs.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.033
-Where's Megan?
-I don't know. In the bathroom.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.077
Hurry up, get everybody.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.038
Bobby, Gene, Mom's here.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.372
Come on.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.426
We were waiting.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.804
And they buzzed you.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.848
Henry's doubIe-parked.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.267
I'm sorry. I've Iost track of the time.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.726
Don's Iate.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.063
This is quite an apartment.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.190
Thank you.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.734
I think you've seen most of it.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.405
-Bobby, come on.
-I'II go get them.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.949
Daddy was supposed to bring
the coIored penciIs.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.784
I'II buy you some. Let's go.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.581
Okay, goodbye.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.336
Bye.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.213
This is irritating.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.425
I'II see you in two weeks.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.552
Goodbye.

08:40.312 --> 08:43.397
A traiI of Sno BaIIs Ieading to bigger saIes.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.235
A frozen machine
that makes money for vendors.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.280
Now, if it's for the customers, the kids,

08:52.741 --> 08:55.075
do they get to work the machine?

08:55.702 --> 08:56.952
Find out.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.079
A snowman

09:01.666 --> 09:03.125
on the beach.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.023
A Sno BaII's chance in heII.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.360
They don't meIt.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.363
They're refreshing for the damned.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.948
They're sinfuI.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.410
The Sno BaII is the sin
that gets you into heII.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.122
They're sinfuIIy deIicious.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.794
Jesus, not bad.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.259
Just put Gene to bed. I'II be right up.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.870
Everyone Ioves the cartoons
in The New Yorker.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.664
And I thought we couId do that kind

10:23.748 --> 10:27.918
with the guy crawIing across the Sahara
dying of thirst,

10:28.169 --> 10:31.797
the Iong beard, the tattered shirt.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.424
OnIy there's four guys,

10:33.508 --> 10:36.010
and each one has
a thought bubbIe above him.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.179
"Water, water,

10:39.264 --> 10:41.515
"water, Sno BaII."

10:42.684 --> 10:45.102
-What's the Iine?
-Doesn't need one.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.439
WeII, if you want to
stay with the New Yorkerthing,

10:48.523 --> 10:50.149
maybe some kind of cryptic joke.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.694
-I aIready have the joke.
-Okay. Your turn.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.323
As much as I hate
foIIowing another comedian,

10:57.407 --> 10:59.283
Sno BaII, because it's for kids,

10:59.367 --> 11:01.410
demands a big, Ioud joke.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.954
"Hit me in the face with a Sno BaII"
is the tag.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.457
And the picture is someone
getting hit in the face with a snowbaII.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.294
Not the drink, an actuaI
round, white, messy snowbaII.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.755
And when I say someone, I mean a cop,

11:12.839 --> 11:15.966
schooI teacher with gIasses,
businessman, Indian chief.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.719
Anybody kids hate. And maybe a pig.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.181
Why a pig?

11:22.265 --> 11:24.141
I don't know, but everybody Iaughed.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.810
Great, so that's a way to go.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.187
I agree.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.857
AIso, Sno BaII comes with its own sIogan
because when you think of a snowbaII,

11:31.941 --> 11:34.485
there's a 90 % chance
you think of its chance in heII.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.824
Right. That's true.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.369
So I picture this deviI

11:43.912 --> 11:46.497
with a mischievous smiIe on his face,

11:46.581 --> 11:48.874
sipping a Sno BaII
in front of the fIames of heII.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.378
The cup is beading with condensation.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.297
And in your head you hear his voice,

11:55.382 --> 11:57.925
"Yes, even me."

12:02.931 --> 12:04.264
That's actuaIIy good.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.642
I'm gIad I couId surprise you.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.562
No, it's just damn impressive

12:10.647 --> 12:14.066
you couId not write for so Iong
and come back with that.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.150
It's good to know.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.485
Thank you.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.030
-It's great.
-I'm working on the Iine.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.449
I'II do the rest of it.
That's the easiest part to change.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.118
So Iet's run with both of these.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.012
May I?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.390
Judy SteckIer, haIf-pound Ioss.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.024
That's so good. We both had a good week.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.653
I don't know what happened.
I just wasn't that hungry this week.

13:02.157 --> 13:05.242
Stop it. You're here. You came.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.249
This meeting can start
to define what is a good week

13:12.333 --> 13:14.501
and a bad week in our Iives.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.338
But there are good weeks and bad weeks
for thin peopIe, too.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.969
Coming to Weight Watchers
is not just a chance

13:24.053 --> 13:25.679
to feeI better about yourseIf.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.557
It's a chance to share so that if, for exampIe,

13:28.641 --> 13:31.101
you're someone Iike me,
you don't stuff yourseIf

13:31.186 --> 13:33.812
just to keep from teIIing
your famiIy your probIems.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.190
How was your week, everybody?

13:39.652 --> 13:40.861
Betty?

13:45.325 --> 13:48.494
WeII, I had a bad week out there

13:48.578 --> 13:50.245
after having a good week in here.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.664
CouId you stand up, sweetheart?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.549
I, you know, had

14:04.886 --> 14:06.887
a very trying experience.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.559
I was in an unfamiIiar pIace and I saw...

14:14.103 --> 14:17.564
FeIt a Iot of things I wish I hadn't.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.568
And I Iost a haIf a pound.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.696
And I feeI Iike I shouId
pat myseIf on the back

14:24.781 --> 14:26.073
because it was reaIIy hard.

14:28.743 --> 14:31.787
We aIways taIk about our goaI in pounds,

14:31.871 --> 14:33.747
but that's not aII it is, is it?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.249
Thank you, Betty.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.877
Anyone eIse? Katherine with a "k."

14:39.754 --> 14:43.340
Burke DevIin wiII never be a stranger
in CoIIinsport. Just do what you're toId.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.426
But the way he Iooks at Vicky...
I know what that means.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.011
Who was she to him, Mr. CoIIins?

14:48.096 --> 14:50.013
I've heard her name too many times.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.683
What couId that miserabIe
schooImarm offer him that I can't?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.434
I'II kiII myseIf! I wiII!

14:57.355 --> 14:59.273
Who the heII is this woman?

15:00.775 --> 15:02.067
She's a new character.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.819
She's a cook and she's in Iove.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.904
She's insane. She needs a drink.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.199
They want you to be emotionaI.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.659
You haven't even seen the show.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.912
I've seen a soap opera.
I don't think I've seen one this bad.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.789
And isn't this supposed to be scary?

15:15.873 --> 15:19.793
I didn't come for an acting Iesson,
but thank you for making me more nervous.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.504
Come on, we used to
Iaugh about this together.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.965
You'II go in and turn
that chuck into tenderIoin.

15:25.174 --> 15:29.678
You know what? It's just so easy for you
from your throne on 73rd and Park.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.472
Some of us act for a Iiving
and we wait tabIes when we don't.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.559
-That's not fair.
-No, it isn't.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.311
What do you want me to say?

15:37.395 --> 15:40.147
That I'd kiII for an audition
in this piece of crap?

15:40.231 --> 15:41.815
I wouId. Are you happy?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.864
Look, I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

15:49.866 --> 15:54.077
I haven't had a job in a whiIe
and you're Iucky, that's aII.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.287
I am.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.417
I've got to go. I've got a shift.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.345
What shouId I bring for Thanksgiving?

16:12.597 --> 16:14.181
Something sweet.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.023
Mr. Ginsberg is here to see you.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.736
I Iike the connect the dots.
What's it end up being?

16:28.112 --> 16:32.366
ActuaIIy, it's reminiscent
of certain experiences for some peopIe.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.867
Have a seat.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.665
MichaeI, can you keep a secret?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.041
Nope.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.839
I need you to do some work for me
on a prospective account.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.509
It wiII invoIve a cIient dinner.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.928
And murder.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.433
You're not going to dinner.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.562
What I need from you is a coupIe of ideas
for a company caIIed Monarch Wines.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.147
The brand is Manischewitz.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.274
-You assume that I'm Jewish.
-Stop taIking.

17:07.235 --> 17:08.819
They make wine for Jews.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.488
And now they're making one
they want to seII to normaI peopIe.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.532
You know what I mean, peopIe Iike me.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.866
I think they're open to anything,

17:14.951 --> 17:18.328
but it has to be cheap,
surprise, but impactfuI.

17:18.413 --> 17:21.331
Bring me a coupIe of your best
by sundown Friday.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.083
I have done a IittIe research.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.212
You know, I work for the agency.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.924
And I don't know I want
to keep a secret from Don.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.261
You know Don. TaII guy, short temper.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.888
For the purposes of this dinner,
these are my ideas.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.141
If it works out,
Don wiII obviousIy pick you for it

17:39.225 --> 17:40.642
and you can come up
with them aII over again.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.060
Yeah, but why?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.020
WeII, MichaeI,

17:45.481 --> 17:49.317
when a man hates another man
very, very much,

17:49.402 --> 17:52.529
sometimes he wants to know
that something is his,

17:52.613 --> 17:54.865
even if in the end he has to give it up.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.616
You reaIIy do hate CampbeII.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.161
I don't devote the energy
to hating peopIe anymore.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.746
It's for Mr. Cooper.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.457
And what's for me? It's a Iot of work.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.250
My paying cIients might suffer.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.128
Jesus, I am bankroIIing this entire outfit.

18:10.298 --> 18:13.175
Say 1 00 now and 1 00 Monday morning.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.634
You wipe your ass with 200 bucks.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.803
Here, take it.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.639
I've got to start carrying Iess cash.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.979
What are you doing?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.023
I'm sorry.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.609
I can't eat fish five times a week.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.321
I'm sorry.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.908
I don't want you to go to bed hungry.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.910
I don't do it aII the time.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.411
CouIdn't sIeep.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.166
You better take it out.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.767
Sit down. This is nice.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.981
Don't know that it's nice
that I've driven you to this

19:10.066 --> 19:12.275
because I can't controI myseIf.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.653
Sweetheart, it's got nothing to do with you.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.573
-WeII, what is it?
-Nothing.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.080
I've just been putting it together
that this job is a dead end.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.250
Does Lindsay want someone
eIse for the campaign?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.043
Lindsay's not running.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.337
He keeps saying that, but, you know...

19:32.421 --> 19:35.048
Betty, I'm the one who keeps saying it.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.425
Turns out he's the one who means it.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.679
He wants to wait untiI '72,
but now's the time.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.348
Once he's out,
Rocky wiII get the nomination.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.644
Rocky can't run. He's divorced.

19:47.728 --> 19:51.147
Nobody cares anymore.
He just got re-eIected governor.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.986
I bet on the wrong horse, Betty.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.322
I jumped ship for nothing.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.078
This is a setback.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.165
You're aIways thinking about other peopIe,

20:09.250 --> 20:12.294
and then you're angry
because no one's thinking about you.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.420
But I am.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.384
It's so easy to bIame
our probIems on others,

20:19.468 --> 20:21.970
but reaIIy we're in charge of ourseIves.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.389
And I'm here to heIp you,

20:24.473 --> 20:26.516
as you're here to heIp me.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.061
We'II figure out what's next.

20:40.615 --> 20:41.656
What time is it?

20:42.408 --> 20:43.742
Midnight, I think.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.829
Can I count it as tomorrow?

20:48.956 --> 20:50.040
Okay.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.876
Now.

21:05.890 --> 21:06.932
HeIIo?

21:07.308 --> 21:08.308
HeIIo.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.809
What do you want?

21:10.144 --> 21:11.269
I want to have dinner.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.021
Is that a good idea?

21:13.814 --> 21:16.107
You know what, Jane? When we took LSD,

21:16.192 --> 21:19.319
you swore to me that you wouId
aIways be there for me.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.948
Stop teIIing me things I said that night.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.533
Like I know I didn't promise
to remarry right away

21:25.618 --> 21:27.118
just to save you aIimony.

21:27.203 --> 21:30.246
No, this is true.
And I have a very painIess exercise,

21:30.331 --> 21:33.249
which is taking some extremeIy
important cIients to dinner

21:33.334 --> 21:34.584
and having you on my arm.

21:35.211 --> 21:38.838
Why don't you ask Joanie?
She's a professionaI something.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.049
Because they're dying to meet you.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.718
You'd Iike them. It's a dinner.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.971
I'II owe you.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.808
I want you to buy me a new apartment.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.853
What's wrong with the one you're in?

21:55.231 --> 21:57.399
Your mother is my IandIord.

21:57.483 --> 22:02.696
And honestIy, it has a Iot of memories
and it's painfuI to be here.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.492
And I feeI Iike I can't start a new Iife
untiI I start a new Iife.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.202
This is the most expensive dinner in history.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.747
ReaIIy? Because I found the perfect one.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.874
WeII, you're Iucky I caIIed, then.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.043
Fine.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.088
Have your Iawyer teII my Iawyer
what time dinner is.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.049
I don't know,
I feeI Iike one of us shouId say thank you.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.051
Thank you.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.896
What are you doing here?

22:41.986 --> 22:43.403
You can't be here.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.655
I missed you.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.826
And I kept thinking about you.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.542
I thought you were done with me.

22:58.419 --> 22:59.878
I forgot you.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.548
And then I saw you
in the New York Times Sunday magazine.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.734
Can I go watch TV?

23:22.818 --> 23:23.985
Did you finish everything?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.570
Yeah. You can check it.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.989
Yeah? I just might do that.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.703
My God, are you stiII working on the tree?

23:33.788 --> 23:35.580
AII they care about is the names.

23:35.664 --> 23:39.000
WeII, I have questions.
Do Megan and Henry get branches?

23:39.085 --> 23:42.337
Of course. They get a branch off of us
because we're your parents.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.465
What is this mess?

23:47.468 --> 23:49.302
You carry this around with you every day?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.850
This goes in your math foIder.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.146
This goes in your speIIing.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.152
Is this what you're doing in cIass?

24:06.237 --> 24:08.238
No, I made it at Daddy's.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.199
WeII, it's very nice,

24:11.283 --> 24:13.993
aIthough I don't know why he's smiIing.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.130
"Lovely Megan,

24:25.214 --> 24:27.090
"l went to buy a light bulb.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.717
"When l get back, l'll see you better.

24:29.802 --> 24:30.802
"Love, Don."

24:36.308 --> 24:37.934
Everything Iooks good.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.310
I'II take care of this. You can go.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.195
You know what?
Don't forget your Daddy's first wife.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.699
You're right here.
EIizabeth Hofstadt Francis.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.578
No, your father had another wife before me.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.038
He did?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.417
I'm surprised he didn't teII you that.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.211
Megan heIped me.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.464
Just put it down. It's Anna Draper.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.216
She's deceased.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.011
And turn it in aIready.
I don't want another caII from schooI.

25:14.722 --> 25:15.889
Who is she?

25:17.641 --> 25:20.059
I don't know why Megan didn't teII you.
Ask her.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.563
Okay.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.070
I've got an office
just across the Iadies' room

25:31.155 --> 25:32.655
from the insurance company next door.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.241
-At Ieast you're over here.
-I'm the head of my department.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.285
And I've been working very hard
and doing very weII

25:37.369 --> 25:39.954
and nothing has changed here.
It's a Iot of empty promises.

25:40.414 --> 25:41.664
What were you promised?

25:42.249 --> 25:43.458
HeIIo.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.335
It's a mess in there.

25:50.799 --> 25:54.427
Both campaigns draw you in,
but in different ways. This one's a series.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.722
If Harry roIIs it out right,
you wonder who's gonna get hit next.

25:57.806 --> 25:58.806
That's great.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.268
And this one puIIs you in
as you hear the eviI voice inside your head.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.313
"This couId change everything."

26:06.982 --> 26:08.358
I think the deviI is cIever.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.610
SnowbaII's chance in heII and so forth.

26:11.278 --> 26:14.072
But I think the getting hit in the face
has a Ioud, juveniIe quaIity

26:14.156 --> 26:16.324
that makes a Sno BaII seem
more fun than a soft drink.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.867
AIso, they kept taIking about refreshing,

26:17.952 --> 26:19.911
and this one is IiteraIIy a sIap in the face.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.204
The deviI couId be a series, too.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.373
We couId see what he's up to
in different situations.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.500
And it's got the heat
that Warren taIked about for thirst.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.709
This one's funnier.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.297
Let's Iead with that one and take them both.

26:32.633 --> 26:35.301
-Great.
-Funny stuff. ReaIIy good work.

26:35.386 --> 26:37.136
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.763
I've got drinks.

26:39.473 --> 26:42.141
-Take these to fuII coIor.
-AbsoIuteIy.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.477
-What time is it?
-Bye, creative.

26:45.479 --> 26:48.314
"Look on my works,
ye mighty, and despair."

26:50.609 --> 26:53.695
You shouId read
the rest of that poem, you boob.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.742
Come on. Here.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.661
Bye-bye.

27:02.413 --> 27:03.413
SaIIy?

27:04.915 --> 27:05.957
SaIIy.

27:06.667 --> 27:07.667
Bye.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.128
Have fun.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.798
Come on. Let's go.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.935
Do you want me to make you something?
You haven't eaten.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.479
I toId you I don't want anything.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.606
Why are you being so nasty today?

27:30.691 --> 27:32.025
Because you're a phony.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.611
You don't taIk to me Iike that.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.113
Who is Anna?

27:37.823 --> 27:38.781
What?

27:38.866 --> 27:43.536
You acted Iike you were friends with me.
But you reaIIy do whatever he says.

27:44.538 --> 27:45.580
And guess what?

27:45.664 --> 27:48.207
You're not speciaI. And neither was Anna.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.543
Where did you hear that?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.253
You were my friend first.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.505
Who toId you about her?

27:54.590 --> 27:56.299
Someone who doesn't Iie.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.135
Someone who didn't just
pretend to care about my schooI project.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.804
SaIIy, Iisten to me. I wasn't Iying.

28:01.889 --> 28:04.182
I just... I didn't think it was my pIace to say.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.558
Everybody knows.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.186
You're a IittIe girI. And it's compIicated.

28:08.771 --> 28:11.522
Fine, just keep digging yourseIf deeper.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.403
I don't know what your mother toId you,

28:17.488 --> 28:20.531
but your father and Anna
got married to heIp each other.

28:20.616 --> 28:24.118
They never Iived together
and they never had any babies. Honest.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.788
So why did he marry her?

28:28.165 --> 28:30.083
It was a Iong time ago.

28:30.167 --> 28:33.920
And back then it was the onIy way
to heIp each other out.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.506
So why did he marry you?

28:39.927 --> 28:42.261
-TaIk to your father.
-I don't want to.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.806
And don't teII him I asked. I mean it.

28:47.101 --> 28:49.102
Are you going to make yourseIf cry?

28:50.938 --> 28:53.106
I am your friend, you know.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.907
Judy SteckIer... May I?

29:03.951 --> 29:05.618
Lost a fuII pound.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.286
Good.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.457
What a nice way to end things.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.795
I don't know what happened.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.797
No, it's good.

29:17.881 --> 29:21.259
Betty, you know
maintaining is better than gaining.

29:22.553 --> 29:23.970
It wasn't even a fuII week.

29:24.054 --> 29:26.848
Now everyone deserves
a round of appIause.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.436
You came on a Saturday.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.939
This is the best thing you can do with
the chaIIenge of Thanksgiving ahead.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.566
And we know it's not just the meaI.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.067
It's the cooking, right?

29:38.152 --> 29:39.485
You have to taste everything.

29:41.155 --> 29:43.030
We're supposed to be thankfuI for this,

29:43.490 --> 29:47.201
but the food is just
a symboI of aII the other things.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.788
We shouId fiII ourseIves with our chiIdren,

29:50.873 --> 29:53.040
our homes, our husbands,

29:53.917 --> 29:56.085
our heaIth, our happiness.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.256
So who has a pIan for
how they're gonna handIe the day?

30:01.049 --> 30:02.925
And the day before?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.511
And Iet's not forget about Ieftovers.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.268
Just wanted to make sure she was asIeep.

30:12.853 --> 30:13.978
What's going on with her?

30:16.190 --> 30:19.358
She asked me about Anna.
Betty obviousIy toId her.

30:20.694 --> 30:22.278
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.531
But I think I handIed
the situation as best I couId.

30:25.616 --> 30:27.074
Who the heII toId you to say anything?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.410
What are you doing?

30:29.495 --> 30:30.745
Damn it, this has nothing to do with you.

30:30.829 --> 30:31.871
Keep your voice down.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.789
I'm not gonna Iet her
keep getting away with this crap.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.208
You're just gonna make it worse.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.335
And Iet her keep sticking
her fat nose in my business?

30:37.419 --> 30:38.461
-Let it go.
-Yeah,

30:38.545 --> 30:39.962
and what am I supposed to say to SaIIy?

30:40.047 --> 30:42.298
Nothing. I promised her I wouIdn't teII you.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.008
Jesus, who's the chiId here?

30:44.092 --> 30:45.426
Get your hand off the phone.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.387
You think this is an accident?

30:48.472 --> 30:51.349
If you caII her,
you're giving her exactIy what she wanted,

30:51.433 --> 30:54.977
the thriII of having
poisoned us from 50 miIes away.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.208
I'm sorry.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.546
I didn't know what eIse to do.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.095
I'm sorry about that.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.734
I didn't think anybody'd stiII be here.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.862
I'm gonna Ieave in a minute.
You come to steaI something?

31:46.947 --> 31:49.115
Nah, I'm doing some work for Roger.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.285
But I'm not supposed to teII anybody.

31:55.581 --> 31:59.041
It's a wine. He's trying to reeI them in.

31:59.126 --> 32:00.418
Wants to Iook smart at the meeting.

32:01.295 --> 32:02.336
And he asked you?

32:03.547 --> 32:06.591
What can I say?
I have gifts and I'm gratefuI.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.885
Just so you know, he's not going to pay
you if you teII everybody.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.470
He aIready did.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.056
Maybe I'II throw some of it
your way if you teII me what you think.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.600
I don't care.

32:40.709 --> 32:41.709
HeIIo.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.669
The articIe came out
and we're not mentioned.

32:43.754 --> 32:47.048
-What?
-It's a buIIshit piece on the usuaI asshoIes.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.508
He compares them to phiIosophers.

32:50.177 --> 32:51.218
HoId on.

32:51.720 --> 32:52.845
Page 52.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.646
HoId on.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.319
170 is the kicker.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.786
Jesus, they Iook Iike Peter, PauI and Mary.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.204
Why are they picking them?

33:18.288 --> 33:19.747
I don't know and I don't care.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.207
Maybe that's the probIem.

33:21.291 --> 33:22.792
You were the one who
taIked to him for an hour.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.503
I thought he was your best friend.
You obviousIy made no impression.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.672
-He's a rat bastard.
-You know what?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.924
Don't wake me up
and throw your faiIures in my face.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.384
It's Sunday, for Christ's sake.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.721
SaIIy, get back here.
Boys, back to your room.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.476
Get over here.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.315
Do you have something you want to ask me?

33:46.400 --> 33:47.441
No.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.276
You do, but you thought
it'd be better to ask Megan.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.153
She wasn't supposed to say anything.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.697
And what was she supposed to do exactIy?

33:52.781 --> 33:54.073
Not Iie again.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.912
I'm sorry.

34:00.914 --> 34:01.914
I know it's my fauIt

34:01.998 --> 34:04.333
that you even have to think
about things Iike this.

34:04.418 --> 34:07.086
-You're a IittIe girI.
-I'm not a IittIe girI.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.047
Then you shouId reaIize that your mother
doesn't care about hurting you.

34:10.132 --> 34:11.507
She just wants to hurt us.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.175
-Are you done?
-No.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.348
Anna and I were married because of a Iaw.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.059
It wasn't romantic. She was a friend.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.479
And I wouId have toId you aII about her,
but she died.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.192
Is she the woman whose house
we went to in CaIifornia?

34:30.277 --> 34:31.652
The one who caIIed you Dick?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.450
Yes.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.245
And I reaIIy wish you'd met her.

34:45.459 --> 34:46.584
Now, you reaIize

34:46.668 --> 34:50.004
an aduIt wouId apoIogize to Megan
even if teIIing her was an accident.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.464
Okay.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.383
Go hang up the phone in my room.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.106
Anything for me in there?

35:10.108 --> 35:11.776
Why don't you have
Ginsberg get your Iunch?

35:14.863 --> 35:17.615
That Mohawk work I did for you was great.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.701
And I kept it a secret,
which is more than I can say for Ginsberg.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.662
It's Manischewitz. He was perfect for it.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.707
I'm sick of hearing peopIe think that way.

35:26.792 --> 35:30.044
I'm not an airpIane either.
I can write for anything.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.964
You know, in the oId buiIdings,
they used to have an executive eIevator.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.342
You are not IoyaI.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.886
You onIy think about yourseIf.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.931
Were we married?
Because you're thinking about yourseIf, too.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.642
That's the way it is.
It's every man for himseIf.

35:47.687 --> 35:51.023
Quaid's department deveIoped Sno BaII,
and he wiII remind you.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.901
We've got Bob Dennison,
who speaks for the IocaI bottIers.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.611
We'II aIso have MichaeI LIoyd
and Warren Kent,

35:55.695 --> 35:57.488
who deaI with the IocaI retaiIers.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.617
-You want me to get those?
-I'm not taking two.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.046
SaIIy?

36:16.424 --> 36:18.634
SaIIy, get in here right now.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.641
That was Mrs. EngeI.

36:25.725 --> 36:28.561
ApparentIy you got an A-pIus
on your famiIy tree.

36:29.396 --> 36:30.980
She thinks you're reaIIy
turning things around.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.690
It's just a drawing.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.316
I'm very proud of you.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.613
You shouId thank Megan for her heIp.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.240
She heIped you, didn't she?

36:41.324 --> 36:42.658
I guess so.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.577
She just toId me the same stuff you did.

36:48.081 --> 36:51.417
ReaIIy? You asked her about Anna?

36:52.127 --> 36:56.088
Yes. Daddy showed me pictures
and they spoke very fondIy of her.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.719
I guess you've earned some TV.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.982
So I puIIed over to the side of the interstate

37:15.066 --> 37:17.776
and I Iet him out with
his Iuggage and everything.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.113
He is not reIated to me.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.489
SiegeI's a very common name.

37:22.574 --> 37:26.160
You wouIdn't want to think everyone
named Rosenberg is reIated to you.

37:26.828 --> 37:27.995
I didn't want to say it.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.707
Lord knows there's been
pIenty of prejudice in this country.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.251
But growing up in Manhattan,
I've aIways envied the humor,

37:34.336 --> 37:37.004
the cIoseness, the way
your peopIe keep track of each other.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.423
So you married your way in, huh?

37:40.634 --> 37:44.261
I've aIways thought Jewish women
are the most beautifuI women in the worId.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.974
Now that's a saIes pitch.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.517
I'm sorry I'm Iate.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.478
This is my son, Bernard.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.272
We're stiII on drinks.
Roger SterIing, this is my wife Jane.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.482
Bernie.

37:56.566 --> 37:57.733
Nice to meet you.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.153
I'm sorry about that. I took the boat out.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.155
-We got stuck.
-ReaIIy? What kind of boat?

38:03.239 --> 38:05.991
No, you two can discuss the detaiIs Iater.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.036
My dad doesn't Iike yachts
because Iast time he was on one,

38:09.120 --> 38:10.204
he rode steerage.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.705
And Iook where you are now.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.167
I've been trying to find out
what Roger thinks,

38:15.251 --> 38:16.710
but he wanted to wait for you.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.712
I wanted to wait for dessert,
make sure you Iiked me.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.673
What's not to Iike?

38:23.426 --> 38:26.261
As I understand it,
you're trying to get Manischewitz

38:26.346 --> 38:27.972
into the hands of different kinds of peopIe.

38:28.348 --> 38:31.517
So to us, it seemed the key was,
different kinds of peopIe.

38:32.435 --> 38:35.104
If you ever Iook at the side of a bus,
it's a moving biIIboard.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.982
The passengers can't see the ad,
but everyone can see the passengers.

38:38.733 --> 38:42.444
The idea was to put a picture of the bus
seats on the side of the bus

38:42.529 --> 38:44.571
right beIow the window
where the reaI peopIe are,

38:44.656 --> 38:46.865
show the bottom haIves of their bodies

38:46.950 --> 38:49.201
with a case of Manischewitz
under each of their seats.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.707
So it Iooks Iike whoever's riding the bus
has bought the wine.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.959
Isn't that cIever?

38:57.043 --> 38:58.669
So you thought that up, huh?

38:59.129 --> 39:03.882
I engaged some of our creatives ad hoc
in anticipation of this dinner.

39:03.967 --> 39:06.885
I figured even if you didn't Iike it,
you couId see what we were capabIe of.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.053
I know it's good.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.304
Do we need menus?

39:09.389 --> 39:10.472
I do.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.434
I'm getting the chateaubriand
if someone wiII spIit it with me.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.561
I thought you Iiked the crabs rangoon here.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.229
I just had some.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.358
So, Roger, what kind of boat do you have?

39:29.200 --> 39:32.077
Am I the onIy one
who can work and drink at the same time?

39:33.371 --> 39:34.997
-What happened?
-They Iaughed,

39:35.081 --> 39:36.749
they bought it and we aIready ceIebrated.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.209
I'm onIy here because I've got
three hours Ieft on the coast.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.086
-Hot damn!
-I knew it.

39:42.088 --> 39:45.674
HoId on. We work our ass off
and we don't even warrant a caII?

39:45.759 --> 39:47.176
BIow by bIow, pIease.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.678
Don pitched the heII out of it,
they said it was cIever.

39:49.763 --> 39:52.431
And apparentIy kids
Iike deviIs in cartoons, as I predicted.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.018
ReaIIy? They didn't Iike the other one?

39:56.102 --> 39:57.519
I don't know. He Ieft it in the cab.

39:57.604 --> 40:00.105
Are you kidding me?
They never even heard it?

40:00.190 --> 40:02.441
We made a saIe. Anything eIse?

40:09.449 --> 40:11.033
I'm going to order some dinner.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.660
Sure. He's gonna be useIess tonight.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.876
So, you suddenIy
have no probIem teIIing peopIe I'm Jewish?

40:20.960 --> 40:23.045
You going to meet Bernie?

40:23.129 --> 40:25.089
What? No.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.801
So you're not gonna caII him in two days
and teII him we're separated?

40:29.135 --> 40:31.386
You had your chance
to say who I sIeep with.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.597
You're supposed to heIp me Iand this.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.933
So if something goes on
between the two of you,

40:36.017 --> 40:37.601
you'd better pretend you're stiII married.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.645
I promise, bubaIa.

40:41.856 --> 40:42.940
I'm sorry.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.821
The Ieast you can do is show me what
the better end of this deaI Iooks Iike.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.406
-What do you mean?
-The apartment.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.076
Show it to me.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.536
When eIse am I gonna get a chance?

40:55.995 --> 40:58.497
I'm not moved in. I just got the key.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.053
Has a Iot of potentiaI.

41:14.347 --> 41:15.848
You think so?

41:19.686 --> 41:21.353
I have missed you.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.881
Roger, wait.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.551
What?

42:08.526 --> 42:11.236
I'm surprised you're working today.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.363
We roII out aII our business this week.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.783
I'm just gonna
spend as much time as I can with my girI

42:16.868 --> 42:19.328
before I'm trapped with my famiIy
over the hoIiday.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.830
You know what, Howard?

42:21.915 --> 42:23.582
Why don't you spend Thanksgiving with her,

42:23.666 --> 42:26.335
and I'II go to your house
and screw your wife?

42:29.214 --> 42:30.839
Are you kidding me?

42:30.924 --> 42:32.132
Good Iuck with that.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.929
But I guess the grass
is aIways greener, right?

42:46.272 --> 42:48.023
I know you saw me.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.442
I thought you were hiding from someone.

42:52.904 --> 42:56.782
That was a boId Iast-minute decision,
going with your idea.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.033
I thought it was more what they wanted.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.618
We'II never know, wiII we?

43:00.286 --> 43:01.495
Because they never heard mine.

43:01.579 --> 43:05.040
Look, I don't Iike going in with two ideas.
It's weak.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.209
And you don't wanna be weak,
so you picked yours.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.878
And they bought it,
which is our goaI, isn't it?

43:11.631 --> 43:14.258
What do I care? I got a miIIion of 'em.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.468
-A miIIion.
-Good.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.971
I guess I'm Iucky you work for me.

43:21.182 --> 43:22.557
I feeI bad for you.

43:22.642 --> 43:24.559
I don't think about you at aII.

43:31.192 --> 43:32.901
-Good morning, Mr. Draper.
-Morning.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.829
I used the toothbrush in there.
I hope it's yours.

43:44.914 --> 43:46.206
Why did you do that?

43:47.500 --> 43:50.752
Jesus, it doesn't beIong to the dead guy,
does it? It's pink.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.464
I toId you why I wanted this apartment
and you ignored me.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.051
I hardIy ignored you.

43:59.512 --> 44:02.222
Now this is no different than the Iast pIace.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.599
ReaIIy? I think it's nicer.

44:04.684 --> 44:06.101
Not anymore.

44:08.438 --> 44:10.022
You ruined this.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.282
Shit.

44:21.784 --> 44:25.370
You get everything you want
and you stiII had to do this.

44:28.374 --> 44:29.875
You're right.

44:33.463 --> 44:35.589
I don't know why I did that.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.217
I feeI terribIe.

45:08.581 --> 45:09.664
SmeIIs good.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.169
I just got off the phone with JuIia.

45:14.253 --> 45:15.504
She got the part.

45:16.089 --> 45:17.089
Good for her.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.591
She asked me to buy champagne.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.927
And you wiII
because you want her to be happy.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.263
It's hot as heII in here. Turn on the air.

45:25.348 --> 45:27.849
It's on fuII bIast. Go get ready.

45:27.934 --> 45:29.101
Open the door at Ieast.

45:29.185 --> 45:30.227
No, don't.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.688
The radio said there's a smog emergency.

45:33.773 --> 45:36.358
The air is toxic. I don't want that in here.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.244
That is a good-Iooking bird.

45:48.788 --> 45:52.124
Mommy, wait. We're supposed to
say what we're thankfuI for.

45:53.126 --> 45:54.501
She's hungry, Bobby.

45:55.044 --> 45:57.129
No, I think it's nice.

45:57.755 --> 45:58.880
Go ahead, buddy.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.383
I'm thankfuI that I have two houses

46:01.467 --> 46:03.927
and they're both reaIIy big
and I got a new sIed.

46:05.638 --> 46:07.514
I'm thankfuI that I'm doing good in schooI.

46:07.598 --> 46:08.974
Doing weII.

46:11.477 --> 46:13.728
I am thankfuI that I have everything I want.

46:14.814 --> 46:17.149
And that no one eIse has anything better.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.776
Me, too. Let's eat.
