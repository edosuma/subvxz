<i>Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...</i>

00:03.416 --> 00:04.950
- (David): The Author!
- (Mary Margaret): We know him, Emma.

00:04.980 --> 00:06.589
Because of him, we were put on the path

00:06.619 --> 00:08.557
to causing Maleficent to lose her child.

00:08.587 --> 00:10.405
- (Maleficent): She's alive.
- (Gold): In this world.

00:10.435 --> 00:12.461
- (Zelena): Hello, sis.
- (Regina): Zelena.

00:12.491 --> 00:13.927
Where's Robin? What have you
done with him?

00:13.957 --> 00:15.130
One phone call from me,

00:15.160 --> 00:17.311
and your beloved dies at
the hands of your sister.

00:17.341 --> 00:20.302
- What do you want from me?
- You are gonna write new happy endings.

00:20.332 --> 00:22.104
You have made me a monster,

00:22.134 --> 00:25.348
but I won't let you do the same to Emma.

00:27.042 --> 00:30.574

(Sighs deeply)

01:15.455 --> 01:18.091
(Growling continues)

01:18.121 --> 01:19.754
- (British accent) Heel.
- (Growling stops)

01:19.789 --> 01:21.199
- (Whines)
- That's far enough.

01:21.254 --> 01:23.559
Now be a good girl and come back home.

01:23.589 --> 01:24.894
I won't.

01:25.328 --> 01:27.089
You can't make me.

01:30.622 --> 01:32.472
As a matter of fact, I can.

01:32.830 --> 01:33.995
(Snaps fingers)

01:34.025 --> 01:36.472
(Growling resumes)

01:36.506 --> 01:39.140
(Breathing shakily)

01:39.974 --> 01:42.517
And now that your father's
gone, we're going to make

01:42.548 --> 01:46.180
a few changes around the house, Cruella.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.197
(Door creaks)

02:07.586 --> 02:10.053
This is where you'll be
sleeping from now on.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.890
So you're just going to drop me off here?

02:12.924 --> 02:15.011
Like one of your dogs?

02:15.041 --> 02:17.261
This room must be your world now,

02:17.295 --> 02:20.398
until someday, you learn to do as I say.

02:23.167 --> 02:26.203
_

02:32.175 --> 02:34.912
(Tires squeal)

02:34.942 --> 02:36.131
Uhh!

02:36.161 --> 02:38.403
(Engine idling)

02:38.433 --> 02:40.067
(Exhales sharply)

02:40.885 --> 02:42.383
(Turns off engine)

02:43.897 --> 02:45.805
We need to talk.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.495
Good thing I had my brakes
serviced, darling.

02:47.525 --> 02:49.463
I do hate getting blood on the car.

02:49.493 --> 02:51.098
There's still time for that.

02:51.128 --> 02:53.339
Tell me about Lily.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.338
- Sorry. Who?
- My daughter Lily.

02:57.597 --> 03:00.269
You told me she didn't survive
the trip to this world.

03:00.467 --> 03:02.030
You lied.

03:02.526 --> 03:05.595
Perhaps I did. Um, but there's
an explanation, of course.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.171
You see, um...

03:07.698 --> 03:08.949
(Sighs)

03:08.979 --> 03:10.868
I'm a really terrible person,

03:10.898 --> 03:13.966
and I left her in the woods to die.

03:14.151 --> 03:15.891
You did what?

03:15.921 --> 03:17.190
Oh, don't be so flabbergasted.

03:17.220 --> 03:19.275
You know I'm not mother material.

03:19.305 --> 03:21.978
Ursula and I took that
dragon egg she was in.

03:22.008 --> 03:24.792
Oh, the magic helped us
stay young, you know.

03:24.822 --> 03:26.249
Wonderful thing.

03:26.279 --> 03:28.547
- But the little brat...
- My daughter.

03:28.752 --> 03:31.212
- Yes. Well...
- (Clicks tongue)

03:31.510 --> 03:33.035
You should know

03:33.065 --> 03:37.238
your death is going to last for days.

03:39.105 --> 03:41.547
(Whoosh)

03:43.626 --> 03:49.083
(Growls and roars)

03:49.117 --> 03:52.287
(Growls)

03:53.716 --> 03:55.855
(Blows air)

03:55.890 --> 03:58.387
<i>(Roars)</i>

03:58.551 --> 04:00.528
Oh, I was so hoping you'd do that.

04:00.562 --> 04:03.531
People always underestimate
a girl in diamonds and furs,

04:03.565 --> 04:04.903
don't they?

04:04.933 --> 04:06.593
I mean, no one guessed
what I was really after.

04:06.623 --> 04:09.290
Not Gold. Certainly not you.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.588
(Low growling)

04:10.622 --> 04:12.389
But now that The Author is here,

04:12.424 --> 04:14.992
today is the day that I get mine.

04:15.027 --> 04:16.442
(Growls)

04:16.471 --> 04:20.765
Now be a good girl, lie
down, and take a nap.

04:21.183 --> 04:25.084

04:43.971 --> 04:46.139
(Emma): You have to remember
something else about The Author,

04:46.173 --> 04:48.190
some way to find him. Now think.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.762
- (Door closes)
- We told you everything we know.

04:49.792 --> 04:52.199
Are we sure about that? Because
secrets just keep coming out.

04:52.229 --> 04:54.838
Okay. You're clearly still upset.

04:54.868 --> 04:56.773
Yes, I am still upset.

04:56.803 --> 04:59.609
You were the ones who taught
me there is always a right way.

04:59.639 --> 05:00.579
A heroic way.

05:00.615 --> 05:02.929
And what you did to Maleficent's child...

05:02.959 --> 05:04.259
It was our only option

05:04.294 --> 05:06.950
to make sure you grew up... good.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.147
I'm sorry, but if it were me,
no matter what,

05:08.181 --> 05:10.229
I would not harm a defenseless person.

05:10.259 --> 05:11.383
And that right there...

05:11.417 --> 05:14.019
That goodness is exactly
why we did what we did.

05:14.049 --> 05:16.429
- It was worth it.
- (Door opens)

05:17.587 --> 05:18.906
Regina, where have you been?

05:18.963 --> 05:21.231
- (Sighs)
- In the middle of a very bad day.

05:21.261 --> 05:22.698
I'll tell you the whole story later,

05:22.728 --> 05:24.567
after I rescue Robin Hood.

05:24.597 --> 05:26.198
Robin Hood? What the hell
are you talking about?

05:26.232 --> 05:28.887
I called that number you gave me,

05:28.917 --> 05:31.986
but Marian answered the
phone, and I discovered...

05:32.462 --> 05:34.984
She's not really Marian at all.

05:35.273 --> 05:36.777
So who is she?

05:38.678 --> 05:40.211
Zelena.

05:40.663 --> 05:41.967
The wicked witch?

05:41.997 --> 05:45.432
I don't know how it's
possible, but my sister

05:45.467 --> 05:48.430
has been masquerading
as her this entire time.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.704
And she's in league with Gold.

05:50.739 --> 05:52.706
Robin's in danger, so I'm going
to New York to find him

05:52.741 --> 05:53.746
and stop her.

05:53.776 --> 05:55.964
And what about Gold?
If they're working together,

05:55.994 --> 05:58.950
he's not just gonna let you
waltz off and spoil his plans.

05:58.980 --> 06:00.831
I wouldn't worry about Gold.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.367
I know exactly how to handle him.

06:08.620 --> 06:09.714
Oh! (Chuckles)

06:09.744 --> 06:12.109
Regina, I didn't, uh,
didn't hear you come in.

06:12.143 --> 06:15.145
Your ex-husband has done
quite a number on me, Belle.

06:15.917 --> 06:16.813
Oh.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.371
- I'm, uh...
- (Clears throat)

06:18.401 --> 06:21.856
- Sorry to hear that.
- And now he wants me to work with him.

06:21.886 --> 06:24.161
Uh, well, I'm sure
that would be a mistake.

06:24.191 --> 06:26.089
I know it is.

06:27.892 --> 06:29.092
How can I help?

06:30.337 --> 06:32.340
I'm glad you asked.

06:32.370 --> 06:34.997
(Door creaks)

06:35.602 --> 06:37.503
Well, this is certainly homey.

06:37.533 --> 06:39.101
Antlers are a nice touch.

06:39.136 --> 06:40.302
(Door closes)

06:40.636 --> 06:42.610
Makes me feel like Hemingway.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.119
Or maybe Thoreau.

06:44.149 --> 06:45.362
Name's Isaac, by the way.

06:45.392 --> 06:48.027
Do you always talk this much?

06:48.836 --> 06:50.930
Only when I'm nervous.

06:50.964 --> 06:53.290
- (Inhales deeply)
- And you still have my quill.

06:53.320 --> 06:57.336
Yeah. Well, for now, let's call it...

06:57.370 --> 06:58.838
My quill.

07:01.276 --> 07:02.908
You know, it's worthless without its ink.

07:02.943 --> 07:04.364
Oh, I'm aware,

07:04.394 --> 07:06.693
and I plan to obtain some very soon.

07:06.723 --> 07:08.551
Yeah. And just how are you gonna do that?

07:08.581 --> 07:09.636
Simple.

07:09.666 --> 07:11.866
Now you're here,

07:11.901 --> 07:14.202
I'm gonna turn the savior dark.

07:14.717 --> 07:16.155
What will that accomplish?

07:16.185 --> 07:18.261
Once her heart has been blackened,

07:18.291 --> 07:20.759
everything I need shall fall into place.

07:22.394 --> 07:24.488
You'll see soon enough,

07:24.518 --> 07:26.864
when my associates return.

07:27.187 --> 07:31.285
Your associates seem
to have a taste for fur.

07:31.315 --> 07:32.442
(Sniffs)

07:32.472 --> 07:34.605
And perfume.

07:34.851 --> 07:37.608
Can't wait to meet them.

07:37.638 --> 07:40.388
Surely you must know
them from your stories.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.680
Know of them, sure,

07:42.714 --> 07:44.515
- but an author rarely gets...
- Be quiet.

07:45.670 --> 07:48.710
Don't say another word.

07:49.621 --> 07:51.872
- Something's just come up.
- (Sighs)

07:51.902 --> 07:53.311
You stay here till I return.

07:53.341 --> 07:56.393
Until you return? But who's
gonna... <i>(Whoosh)</i>

07:57.910 --> 07:59.012
Protect me?

07:59.047 --> 08:00.380
(Belle): Rumplestiltskin.

08:00.415 --> 08:02.365
- Rumple...
- Hello, Belle.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.819
Hello.

08:07.773 --> 08:10.004
This is a curious place to meet.

08:11.943 --> 08:14.419
Do you, uh, do you remember
what you told me here

08:14.449 --> 08:16.401
the night of our vows?

08:16.431 --> 08:19.316
How I chased all the darkness out of you?

08:19.350 --> 08:21.251
- Belle, look, I'm sorry for everything.
- No.

08:22.687 --> 08:25.488
No apologies today.

08:25.673 --> 08:29.375
For once in my life,
I just want the truth.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.367
Why are you here, Rumple?

08:31.397 --> 08:36.147
- Are you... are you trying to win me back?
- It's a bit more complicated than that.

08:39.296 --> 08:40.754
(Whoosh, squish)

08:40.784 --> 08:42.868
- (Grunts)
- (Heartbeat thumping)

08:42.898 --> 08:44.564
Rumple. (Gasps)

08:44.594 --> 08:47.797
It seems that centuries of dark deeds

08:47.827 --> 08:49.828
do take their toll.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.065
And all that's left of it...

08:54.398 --> 08:57.068
Is this.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.841
And pretty soon,

08:58.871 --> 09:00.879
that will be gone, too.

09:00.909 --> 09:03.976
Well... Will you die?

09:04.010 --> 09:05.711
In a manner of speaking, yes.

09:05.745 --> 09:09.380
I will lose any ability to love.

09:09.704 --> 09:12.864
And that goodness that you
once saw inside of me...

09:12.894 --> 09:15.153
Well, that'll be gone forever.

09:16.272 --> 09:21.008
There's only one man who
can reverse this process,

09:21.043 --> 09:23.056
and that's The Author.

09:23.548 --> 09:26.336
That's why I'm here in storybrooke.

09:29.179 --> 09:30.685
(Whoosh, squish)

09:30.719 --> 09:32.146
(Inhales sharply)

09:32.176 --> 09:34.824
(Gold whispers): I don't expect
you to understand, of course.

09:34.854 --> 09:36.320
But I...

09:36.354 --> 09:38.522
I-I do understand.

09:40.358 --> 09:41.558
You do?

09:41.592 --> 09:43.907
Sometimes I worry...

09:44.762 --> 09:49.080
(Voice breaks): I worry I threw
out the chipped teacup too soon.

10:03.314 --> 10:06.516
You know what the problem is, though?

10:06.988 --> 10:12.241
Will is just such a better
kisser than you are.

10:15.286 --> 10:16.359
W-what?

10:16.389 --> 10:18.615
You're pathetic.

10:18.645 --> 10:20.851
Watching you come groveling back to me,

10:20.881 --> 10:23.216
it's like a dog begging for scraps.

10:23.246 --> 10:25.865
Why are you saying that?

10:26.553 --> 10:28.925
This isn't like you, Belle.

10:28.955 --> 10:31.123
But it is so like me.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.931
(Heartbeat thumping)

10:34.961 --> 10:36.858
Regina.

10:38.781 --> 10:42.083
Now forget all this and run along home.

10:49.292 --> 10:52.220
You have no idea

10:52.424 --> 10:54.876
just how much I'm gonna
make you suffer for this.

10:54.906 --> 10:58.477
Oh, you're not gonna do a thing,

10:58.507 --> 11:00.234
unless you wanna see what happens

11:00.268 --> 11:02.837
when I take this heart and squeeze.

11:02.867 --> 11:05.807
(Whispering): Come on.

11:05.841 --> 11:08.142
We both know you don't have it in you.

11:08.177 --> 11:10.211
Don't I?

11:11.914 --> 11:14.153
- (Squish)
- All right, all right.

11:14.183 --> 11:16.004
<i>(Heartbeat continues</i>
<i>thumping)</i>

11:16.034 --> 11:18.151
I believe you.

11:18.181 --> 11:19.750
Good.

11:20.442 --> 11:23.411
So I'm headed to New York now.

11:23.441 --> 11:28.245
And if you breathe one
word of this to Zelena,

11:28.280 --> 11:31.491
you won't be the only
one who loses a heart.

11:41.064 --> 11:42.609
Don't bother studying the greats, darling.

11:42.639 --> 11:44.700
You'll never be one of them.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.042
Hello, Isaac.

11:49.072 --> 11:51.540
Never thought you'd
see me again, did you?

11:51.574 --> 11:52.908
I was certainly hoping not to.

11:52.942 --> 11:54.209
Then why don't you make this easy

11:54.244 --> 11:56.483
and give me back what you took?

11:57.201 --> 11:59.608
Can't do it. Sorry.

11:59.889 --> 12:01.821
- (Books thud)
- (Grunts)

12:01.851 --> 12:02.953
With one whistle,

12:02.983 --> 12:06.922
I can send a hundred
snarling dogs after you.

12:06.956 --> 12:08.542
You could,

12:08.572 --> 12:10.892
but you and I both know that
even with all your magic,

12:10.927 --> 12:13.428
you don't have enough power to hurt me.

12:14.053 --> 12:15.757
(Huffs)

12:17.366 --> 12:19.233
I do hate it when you're right, darling.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.605
Though I do like this
new shade of confidence.

12:24.639 --> 12:27.708
It's so... (whispers) masculine.

12:28.944 --> 12:32.140
Are you sure you can't help a girl out?

12:32.403 --> 12:34.048
For old time's sake?

12:36.551 --> 12:38.156
Not a chance.

12:41.226 --> 12:42.989
Well, then you will pay for what you did

12:43.019 --> 12:45.025
when you made me what I am.

12:45.059 --> 12:48.863
You know, idle threats
don't make for good drama.

12:49.578 --> 12:53.567
But I do see one interesting
story developing here.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.573
Really? And what's that?

12:55.603 --> 12:57.705
Rumplestiltskin.

12:57.918 --> 12:59.907
Has no idea that we know each other.

13:00.096 --> 13:01.675
Which means that...

13:01.710 --> 13:05.316
(Gasps) You lied to him.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.268
So from one old friend to another,

13:08.298 --> 13:11.055
you should probably be
gone before he gets back.

13:11.085 --> 13:14.688
Oh, you always did know how to
infuriate a girl, didn't you?

13:15.138 --> 13:18.525
Well, enjoy the upper hand
while it's still on your wrist,

13:19.063 --> 13:20.393

Plug that back in. You simply
have to hear this song.

13:48.838 --> 13:51.945
You stole it, didn't you?
Last time I let you out?

13:51.975 --> 13:54.710
Well, that's because
I'm bored out of my mind!

13:54.744 --> 13:58.117
I-I've read every book

To be honest, I'm looking for

a sprinkle of magic, you know?

you wouldn't ask those
questions so callously.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.264
Then why work with Cruella,
if she wants me dead?

23:16.294 --> 23:18.937
A person obsessed with vengeance

23:18.972 --> 23:21.907
is easy to manipulate.

23:21.941 --> 23:24.276
She thought I believed her happy ending

23:24.311 --> 23:27.089
was reconciling with her mother.

23:27.119 --> 23:30.246
But I knew she was
after something else...

23:30.276 --> 23:32.283
Your death.

23:32.318 --> 23:34.473
Now I wanna know why.

23:34.503 --> 23:37.438
I wanna precisely what
you wrote about her,

23:37.473 --> 23:40.308
the exact words.

23:40.342 --> 23:42.877
You wanna know?

23:43.212 --> 23:45.056
Here.

23:45.086 --> 23:47.486
Read it for yourself.

23:47.933 --> 23:49.417
(Paper rustles)

23:49.451 --> 23:52.220
I'm better on the page, anyway.

23:59.094 --> 24:01.012
(Chuckles)

24:03.365 --> 24:05.565
♪♪

24:11.339 --> 24:13.340
(Song stops)

24:13.374 --> 24:14.975
(Man speaks indistinctly)

24:17.029 --> 24:20.430
(Cruella): I wish, I wish
this would never end.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.139
Well, thank you.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.005
This was a night I shan't forget.

24:30.764 --> 24:33.831
I-I-I can make it
even more memorable.

24:33.861 --> 24:37.063
There's something I wanna show you.

24:38.327 --> 24:40.066
(Latches open)

24:45.906 --> 24:47.349
A pen?

24:47.379 --> 24:48.908
It's more than that.

24:48.943 --> 24:51.609
It's the most important
thing I have. It's...

24:51.639 --> 24:53.217
Special.

24:54.638 --> 24:57.599
See, there's something
about me I haven't told you.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.462
Well, whatever it is, don't worry.

24:59.492 --> 25:01.754
I mean, I've told you all my secrets.

25:01.788 --> 25:04.023
(Whispers) You can tell me anything.

25:05.659 --> 25:07.125
Okay.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.028
The truth is, I don't
go across the country

25:09.062 --> 25:12.218
collecting stories for the paper.
The places I go...

25:12.248 --> 25:13.616
Well...

25:13.650 --> 25:15.384
They're a lot farther apart.

25:16.002 --> 25:18.274
I-I travel across realms.

25:18.304 --> 25:20.072
Realms of storytelling.

25:20.656 --> 25:21.961
What?

25:21.991 --> 25:25.841
This place right here is one of them.
It... it exists out of time.

25:26.562 --> 25:28.463
Tell me, what year is it?

25:29.309 --> 25:30.565
Oh. Um...

25:30.599 --> 25:33.068
Oh, who bothers with such trivial things?

25:33.102 --> 25:35.703
(Whispers) Exactly. We're not in a time.

25:35.738 --> 25:37.406
We're in a realm of story.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.074
There are many... some beautiful,

25:40.108 --> 25:43.993
some horrific, and
some just plain magical.

25:44.023 --> 25:45.795
I think you've had too much gin.

25:45.825 --> 25:49.312
I know how it sounds, but that's
not even the craziest part.

25:49.342 --> 25:52.754
This pen and ink are
enchanted with magic.

25:52.788 --> 25:55.089
They're so powerful, I can do more

25:55.123 --> 25:57.896
than just write people's stories.

25:59.461 --> 26:01.862
(Whispers) I can change them.

26:01.896 --> 26:04.527
Are you really serious?

26:04.949 --> 26:07.016
I can prove it.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.208
(Quill scratching paper)

26:09.238 --> 26:11.112
(Whoosh)

26:13.246 --> 26:16.027
- Look.
- (Whoosh)

26:17.812 --> 26:20.080
(Gasps) That's impossible.

26:20.114 --> 26:21.874
That's some kind of trick.

26:21.904 --> 26:23.466
Is it?

26:23.496 --> 26:25.752
How about a pair of
diamond earrings to match?

26:25.782 --> 26:28.195
- (Quill scratching paper)
- (Whoosh)

26:28.439 --> 26:30.156
(Whoosh)

26:31.225 --> 26:33.093
That pen and ink really are magic.

26:33.127 --> 26:35.095
Careful. They have to be used together.

26:35.129 --> 26:39.099
There's no telling what would
happen if that ink spilled.

26:39.884 --> 26:42.017
And you can write anything?

26:42.047 --> 26:43.603
(Whispers) Yes.

26:43.637 --> 26:45.070
Don't you see?

26:45.105 --> 26:47.306
I can use it to whisk us away

26:47.340 --> 26:51.110
to someplace where your mother
and her dogs can never find us.

26:51.144 --> 26:52.816
We can be together.

26:52.846 --> 26:55.068
Oh. If only it were that simple.

26:55.098 --> 26:56.269
It can be.

26:56.299 --> 26:57.448
What if I gave you magic,

26:57.478 --> 27:00.302
so no matter where you
were, you'd be safe?

27:01.304 --> 27:02.726
You'd do that for me?

27:02.756 --> 27:04.139
(Whispers) Watch me.

27:04.174 --> 27:05.924
(Dips quill)

27:10.046 --> 27:11.275
(Whoosh)

27:11.305 --> 27:15.208
_

27:16.530 --> 27:18.286
- (Whoosh)
- Oh.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.055
(Chuckles) I think I...

27:20.089 --> 27:23.370
- I think I can feel it working.
- Let's leave now.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.865
We can get in my car and just drive.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.790
We won't stop until we're far, far away.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.799
No. I have to face my mother first.

27:30.833 --> 27:33.434
She needs to know that she
no longer has power over me.

27:33.468 --> 27:35.090
- I can take you.
- No. I...

27:35.120 --> 27:37.532
I'm afraid it's something
I have to do alone.

27:37.562 --> 27:40.162
And because of you, I can.

27:41.321 --> 27:43.111
Meet you at the hotel?

27:43.145 --> 27:48.232
And promise me you won't run off
with any other lucky girl.

27:48.766 --> 27:50.454
(Whispers) I promise.

27:50.484 --> 27:53.207
Here. Take my car to be sure.

27:53.237 --> 27:55.193
It's yours now.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.478
(Whispers) Until then.

28:20.048 --> 28:21.848
(David): I recognize that trailhead marker.

28:21.882 --> 28:23.560
Cruella is holding Henry

28:23.590 --> 28:25.665
a couple of miles South
of the toll bridge.

28:25.695 --> 28:27.754
- (Hook): So what now?
- Time to get our hands dirty

28:27.788 --> 28:29.187
and do whatever it takes to get him back.

28:29.221 --> 28:31.022
You're not actually
considering Cruella's demand

28:31.057 --> 28:33.391
- to kill The Author?
- Of course not.

28:33.426 --> 28:34.827
Even if we could find him,

28:34.861 --> 28:36.895
it wouldn't be half the
fun of killing Cruella.

28:36.930 --> 28:38.875
Let's see how she likes
being made into outerwear.

28:38.905 --> 28:40.866
- Regina!
- What?

28:40.900 --> 28:42.934
It's Emma's heart we're
trying to protect, not mine.

28:42.964 --> 28:44.870
If we go in guns blazing,
we risk hurting Henry.

28:44.904 --> 28:46.237
We have to find another way.

28:46.272 --> 28:47.672
I've headed many rescue missions.

28:47.706 --> 28:49.479
It would be helpful to
know the terrain more.

28:49.509 --> 28:52.010
And where The Author is. If
he's enemies with Cruella,

28:52.044 --> 28:53.777
maybe he knows the
best way to defeat her.

28:53.807 --> 28:55.180
Oh, we may be able to help with that.

28:55.214 --> 28:57.786
We went back to the convent
and found a flask that we gave him.

28:57.816 --> 28:59.678
He dropped it when he escaped.

28:59.708 --> 29:01.147
A locator spell might work on it.

29:01.177 --> 29:03.020
Sounds like a perfect job for you two.

29:03.054 --> 29:04.855
I'll take Regina and
Hook, and we'll scope out

29:04.885 --> 29:06.791
the area where Cruella's
holed up with Henry.

29:06.825 --> 29:10.127
Emma, I know you're still angry,

29:10.161 --> 29:13.301
- but avoiding us is not going to help.
- I'm not avoiding you.

29:13.670 --> 29:16.416
With Henry's life on the line,
I need to be around people I trust,

29:16.446 --> 29:19.002
and right now, that's not you.

29:21.306 --> 29:23.312
(Door opens)

29:25.303 --> 29:27.325
(Regina): You're acting
like a petulant child.

29:27.355 --> 29:30.308
Your parents did a bad thing.
They apologized. Now get over it.

29:30.338 --> 29:31.925
Forgive me if I don't
take advice from the woman

29:31.960 --> 29:35.532
who held a grudge for half her life
because a 10-year-old spilled a secret.

29:35.562 --> 29:39.003
Swan, if you won't listen to Regina,
perhaps you'll listen to me.

29:39.033 --> 29:40.733
You were able to forgive both of us

29:40.767 --> 29:42.869
all because you found it in
your heart to see past it.

29:42.903 --> 29:45.465
The difference is that
you never held yourself

29:45.495 --> 29:48.295
as some paragon of virtue.

29:48.592 --> 29:49.942
Neither of you did.

29:49.977 --> 29:53.379
You were honest about who you were.

29:53.413 --> 29:56.248
My parents weren't. They
said they were heroes.

29:56.282 --> 30:00.280
(Sighs) Even heroes make mistakes, luv.

30:00.310 --> 30:03.222
You know, not long ago, your
mother gave me some advice.

30:03.256 --> 30:06.125
(Inhales deeply) She said

30:06.159 --> 30:09.361
I needed to believe I could
still earn forgiveness,

30:09.396 --> 30:11.990
that I had a chance at grace.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.696
I didn't realize it then, but...

30:13.726 --> 30:16.015
she was talking about herself.

30:17.453 --> 30:20.637
Emma, she's been trying to make up
for what she did for a long time.

30:20.667 --> 30:22.874
If you two understand them
so well, you forgive them.

30:22.909 --> 30:25.076
I...Can't.

30:25.110 --> 30:26.654
More important things
to worry about right now,

30:26.684 --> 30:28.839
like saving Henry.

30:34.636 --> 30:37.687
Blasted birds. I'll show you
what angry looks like.

30:37.717 --> 30:39.272
(Scoffs)

30:46.965 --> 30:48.471
(Scoffs)

30:52.104 --> 30:54.031
(Growls and barks)

30:54.701 --> 30:57.174
(Sighs) Pongo, sic!

30:57.208 --> 30:58.475
(Growls)

30:58.960 --> 31:01.812
(Barking)

31:01.846 --> 31:03.113
Ugh.

31:05.505 --> 31:07.217
(Knock on door)

31:09.692 --> 31:11.662
Cruella!

31:12.017 --> 31:13.433
You.

31:13.463 --> 31:15.730
(Dogs growling)

31:15.760 --> 31:18.128
Where is she? Where is my daughter?

31:18.162 --> 31:20.163
I don't have to tell you anything.

31:20.198 --> 31:22.265
- (Grunts)
- (Snarls)

31:22.295 --> 31:23.600
(Barks)

31:23.630 --> 31:25.602
The dogs can smell her on you.

31:25.636 --> 31:27.837
Where's she gone? Why were you with her?!

31:27.871 --> 31:29.672
I was following your advice,

31:29.707 --> 31:32.407
living life instead of
just writing about it.

31:32.437 --> 31:34.343
And now, thanks to Cruella,

31:34.377 --> 31:36.212
I won't ever be going back.

31:36.246 --> 31:38.314
- (Whispers) You foolish boy.
- (Growls)

31:38.565 --> 31:40.165
Stay.

31:41.207 --> 31:43.185
You should've gotten far away from her

31:43.220 --> 31:45.309
when you had the chance.

31:46.689 --> 31:48.290
Why?

31:48.325 --> 31:50.648
So your secret would remain buried?

31:50.678 --> 31:54.563
Yes, Cruella told me the truth
about her father and the others,

31:54.598 --> 31:56.398
that you murdered them.

31:56.656 --> 31:59.235
She really did a number
on you, didn't she?

31:59.269 --> 32:01.803
You'd think a newspaper
man would know a tall tale

32:01.838 --> 32:03.204
when he heard one,

32:03.239 --> 32:05.598
because I didn't kill anyone.

32:05.865 --> 32:09.778
Don't you understand? It was Cruella.

32:13.549 --> 32:18.687
You expect me to believe that
that angel I danced with tonight

32:18.721 --> 32:20.755
is a killer? (Scoffs)

32:20.789 --> 32:23.039
I didn't want to believe it either.

32:26.012 --> 32:29.694
She was always a troubled little girl.

32:30.006 --> 32:34.269
Her father and I had hopes
she'd grow out of it.

32:34.303 --> 32:36.737
Until one night, he was
having his tea in the parlor

32:36.772 --> 32:39.506
when I heard a thump.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.441
I raced in to find him dead on the floor

32:41.476 --> 32:43.442
from a heart attack.

32:43.472 --> 32:45.512
Cruella, the poor dear, was there,

32:45.547 --> 32:48.153
paralyzed with shock.

32:48.183 --> 32:52.068
After the doctor left, my
first thoughts went to her,

32:52.098 --> 32:54.437
what effect seeing her father die

32:54.467 --> 32:56.857
would have on an already disturbed mind.

32:56.891 --> 32:59.258
So I went up to try and comfort her.

32:59.288 --> 33:01.899
I expected to find her
crying, but she wasn't.

33:01.929 --> 33:06.651
Instead, I-I saw a hint
of a smile on her face.

33:06.873 --> 33:09.069
I thought I was imagining things,

33:09.103 --> 33:12.397
but then I saw the trumpet
flowers on the bedside table.

33:12.997 --> 33:14.996
Her favorite flowers.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.348
The ones you ripped out
because you hated the smell.

33:17.378 --> 33:20.259
I ripped them out because
they were poisonous.

33:20.592 --> 33:22.649
She poisoned him.

33:22.684 --> 33:24.250
(Exhales)

33:25.169 --> 33:26.717
You're lying.

33:26.747 --> 33:28.085
If what you're saying is true,

33:28.115 --> 33:29.549
you would've gone to the authorities.

33:29.579 --> 33:31.724
How could I?

33:31.758 --> 33:35.697
She was my daughter, and I blamed myself.

33:35.942 --> 33:39.554
I thought if I kept her close
that I could somehow fix her.

33:39.584 --> 33:42.601
But there's no fixing her.

33:42.970 --> 33:46.238
She poisoned the next
two husbands as well.

33:47.495 --> 33:49.406
(Whispers) Get out of here...

33:49.436 --> 33:51.292
(Normal voice) Before
I call the police.

33:51.322 --> 33:53.912
You don't have to believe me.

33:54.197 --> 33:57.165
Just stay away from Cruella.

33:57.528 --> 33:59.101
She takes the things you care about

33:59.135 --> 34:01.385
and she destroys them.

34:07.343 --> 34:09.181
(Door slams)

34:10.446 --> 34:12.179
(Sighs)

34:12.431 --> 34:14.143
(Sighs)

34:15.083 --> 34:18.617
(Sighs) It's just a bucket
of fiction, that's all.

34:26.967 --> 34:28.766
(Latches open)

34:31.940 --> 34:34.190
- (Slams shut)
- (Exhales sharply)

34:38.540 --> 34:39.806
Cruella?

34:39.841 --> 34:42.926
(Dogs growling)

34:44.446 --> 34:46.013
(Footsteps approach)

34:46.420 --> 34:48.882
(Dogs snarl)

34:48.916 --> 34:52.074
Hello, mother. I've been waiting for you.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.733
Dogs!

34:54.089 --> 34:56.094
(Barking)

34:57.959 --> 34:59.392
(Laughs)

34:59.426 --> 35:01.261
Oh, that's not going to work anymore.

35:13.975 --> 35:15.508
(Breathing heavily)

35:15.538 --> 35:17.577
What did you do to them?

35:17.611 --> 35:20.846
I simply taught them a new command...

35:20.881 --> 35:22.114
Kill.

35:22.149 --> 35:23.515
- (Dogs snarling)
- (Gasps)

35:23.550 --> 35:28.223
- (Snarling continues)

35:31.323 --> 35:33.357
(Continues barking)

35:33.392 --> 35:35.395
- Help me! Help!
- (Barking echoes)

35:35.425 --> 35:37.079
It's Henry. Quick, it's
coming from over there.

35:37.109 --> 35:38.302
No, it's this way.

35:38.332 --> 35:39.964
Has Cannon fire damaged your hearing?

35:39.999 --> 35:41.276
It clearly came from over there.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.854
(Henry): No! No! Help me, please!

35:43.884 --> 35:45.743
Split up. Go!

35:46.533 --> 35:47.933

35:47.963 --> 35:49.400

No.

36:06.274 --> 36:08.052
Magic.

36:08.626 --> 36:09.960

36:12.671 --> 36:14.497
(Henry): Help me!

36:15.205 --> 36:16.938
(Continues barking)

36:18.001 --> 36:19.502
Please, somebody...

36:19.537 --> 36:21.515
(Rocks scatter)

36:22.557 --> 36:24.646
(Barking continues)

36:26.699 --> 36:28.882
- Pongo...
- (Growling)

36:29.149 --> 36:30.831
(Panting)

36:31.098 --> 36:33.415
Who says you can't teach
an old dog new tricks?

36:33.450 --> 36:35.184
You shouldn't have run.

36:35.219 --> 36:36.485

36:36.519 --> 36:37.936
Henry!

36:37.966 --> 36:39.355
Mom!

36:39.389 --> 36:41.257
- (Grunts)
- Let him go!

36:41.291 --> 36:42.458
I'm afraid not.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.228
Come any closer, and he dies.

36:53.908 --> 36:55.396

37:12.065 --> 37:14.799

37:24.176 --> 37:27.589
Well, thanks to you, she's dead, darling.

37:27.619 --> 37:30.391
Oh, you should've seen
the look on her face

37:30.421 --> 37:33.291
when her beloved dogs turned on her.

37:33.646 --> 37:35.862
It's a memory I shall truly cherish.

No.

37:39.396 --> 37:40.692
No.

Oh, you needn't fear the dogs anymore.
