I've hidden the knives.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.086
Hello, Mother.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.806
You're looking well.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.803

13:48.080 --> 13:50.811

for a woman your age.

Women my age either recover

13:53.880 --> 13:55.041
or die.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.921
I'm sorry.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.521
If it helps.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.601
It doesn't.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.965

I am the only one you can trust.

I could accomplish this.

from centenarians.

but they keep us both siloed.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.129

16:08.560 --> 16:10.050

This is hers.

This weird book,
but it's got a med chart

16:19.520 --> 16:22.285
and a kid's diary in the back,
and they reference naked DNA.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.046
They're manipulating tumours.

but with gene therapy.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.045
For Wilms tumour.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.727
Yes, a Wilms tumour is caused by a gene
associated with organ development,

16:32.800 --> 16:35.565
and it normally shuts off in infancy.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.291

have 90% of the same genes as humans?

16:54.360 --> 16:55.486

-Mmm-hmm.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.722
Yeah, that's kind of why
I went to see her.

that you've got with all of us.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.806
At the beginning of the 20th century,
the movement goes dormant.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.451
Until the late 1950s,
when the name Neolution

18:04.840 --> 18:07.605
is revived by obscure
academic circles at Cambridge.

18:07.680 --> 18:11.207

for the first time.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.250
Exactly. Coady was a visiting scholar
in the early 1970s.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.369
So, we need crossovers.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.603

39:24.160 --> 39:25.286
It's a specific gene.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.926
Everything I know is on here.

39:29.040 --> 39:32.249
Siobhan, your Deep Throat,
the one that led us to Coady.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.201
Can we count on them again?

39:34.720 --> 39:36.802
I'm not sure we should have
in the first place.

39:37.560 --> 39:38.561
But Why?

39:39.360 --> 39:42.170
Because however they are planning
to exploit Kira, it's happening soon.

39:45.720 --> 39:46.721
(THUDDING)

39:48.920 --> 39:49.921
Hey!

39:50.640 --> 39:51.801
Let me out!

39:53.880 --> 39:54.961
Please!

39:55.880 --> 39:57.086
I'm not letting you out.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.441
Cosi ma ca n rot.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.005
Think of my niece, please!

40:00.120 --> 40:01.929
-(KNOCKING)
-It's them.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.081
<i>IRA: You're not a murderer.</i>

40:03.160 --> 40:04.844
No, I'm everything but.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.361
You've been hiding someone from me.

40:07.720 --> 40:08.721
Oh, jeez.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.365
I'm weirdly into smart guys lately.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.760
(BOTH SCREAMING)

40:12.000 --> 40:14.241
She's been poisoned by Big Cosmetics.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.850
What about...
What about that is confusing?
