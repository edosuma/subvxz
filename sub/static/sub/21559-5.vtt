27:27.667 --> 27:29.300

27:29.335 --> 27:30.668
Yeah, most of these crimes tend to be

27:30.703 --> 27:32.136
committed by underprivileged boys...

27:32.172 --> 27:34.005
Well, no, let's not stereotype.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.475
In my experience, there's been
older, over privileged women

27:37.510 --> 27:40.011
that are just as incorrigible.

27:40.046 --> 27:43.181

higher degree of recidivism

27:43.216 --> 27:45.149
when it comes to the
particular type of crime...

27:45.185 --> 27:47.218
Well, some people just
don't learn their lessons.

they just keep messing around.

28:15.248 --> 28:18.516

alternative to vandalism.
