WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:01.375
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

00:01.375 --> 00:03.417
Due to a recent
bicycle accident,

00:03.417 --> 00:05.751
co-primary Chelsea
will be coming aboard

00:05.751 --> 00:07.417
with her jaw wired shut.

00:07.417 --> 00:11.918
I don't think I could handle
having my mouth wired shut.

00:11.918 --> 00:13.584
I'm gonna put a
little pressure on Jess,

00:13.584 --> 00:16.501
and I'd love to put her
on service and you on laundry.

00:16.501 --> 00:18.292
Where's she at?

00:18.292 --> 00:19.501
-Should I just make my own?
-Yeah.

00:19.501 --> 00:20.626
Oh, my God.

00:20.626 --> 00:22.626
And I don't ever want a
guest making their own drink.

00:22.626 --> 00:24.292
I know.

00:24.292 --> 00:35.501
I think that I'm definitely
reaching my breaking point.

00:35.501 --> 00:37.501
I don't... I... I mean...

00:37.501 --> 00:38.334
I like you, but...

00:38.334 --> 00:46.959
you said it in
the bathroom to me.

00:46.959 --> 00:47.959
I mean, seriously?

00:47.959 --> 00:49.083
Look at this.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.501
I want everything scrubbed.

00:50.501 --> 00:51.667
Okay.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.250
Eddie needs to get control
of his deck team yesterday,

00:54.250 --> 00:56.209
or I'm gonna start handing
out plane tickets.

00:56.209 --> 00:57.667
This is bullsh--.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.542
This is your final wake-up call.

00:59.542 --> 01:01.459
I wanna see
people being proactive,

01:01.459 --> 01:04.083
or people are gonna
lose their job.

01:04.083 --> 01:20.000
There are no more
second chances.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.584
Look how cracked my
hands are getting.

01:21.584 --> 01:23.834
I just don't want
the first hand-job I give

01:23.834 --> 01:25.501
to be like sandpaper.

01:25.501 --> 01:27.292
[chuckles]

01:27.292 --> 01:30.959
[sighs]

01:30.959 --> 01:33.501
-Buongiorno.
-Buongiorno.

01:33.501 --> 01:38.918
Mwah.

01:38.918 --> 01:41.000
I'm kinda feeling
a little defeated.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.209
My body's aching,
I'm realizing, you know,

01:43.209 --> 01:45.417
that I'm just, like,
totally overwhelmed.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.292
Like, anxiety's at 10,
I'm not enjoying myself.

01:48.292 --> 01:50.751
I feel like Martha Stewart
in prison.

01:50.751 --> 01:53.876
It's just
not working for me.

01:53.876 --> 01:55.459
I'm gonna take this guy away.

01:55.459 --> 01:57.459
-Quick like bunnies.
-Quick like bunny.

01:57.459 --> 02:00.417
I'll start rinsing. And you
can just bring the stuff over.

02:00.417 --> 02:02.125
So, if you're gonna do
the welcome towels,

02:02.125 --> 02:04.292
I can set you on sky lounge...
good morning.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.751
-Good morning.
-How are you doing?

02:05.751 --> 02:08.250
Good, can you and
I have a chat, privately?

02:08.250 --> 02:11.751
Sure, let's go down
to main salon.

02:11.751 --> 02:13.375
Sh--.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.876
Good morning, how'd you sleep?

02:16.876 --> 02:19.209
-I slept okay.
-That's good.

02:19.209 --> 02:22.417
I really, really wholeheartedly
wanted to do this.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.167
Yeah.

02:24.167 --> 02:25.584
But my body is
just shutting down.

02:25.584 --> 02:28.459
I could not anticipate
how taxing this would be

02:28.459 --> 02:32.709
on my system, and my body
is just not letting me do it.

02:32.709 --> 02:38.250
I'm really sorry, and I hate
to put you guys in a bad place.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.292
I have to go.
I need to leave.

02:40.292 --> 02:43.417
Obviously, I wanted to
fulfill my end of the bargain.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.501
I'm leaving them
pretty high and dry.

02:45.501 --> 02:46.375
I get it.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.250
But at the end of the day,
I come first.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.042
All right.
You have one hour to pack.

02:51.042 --> 02:52.542
Thank you.

02:52.542 --> 02:56.209
Go figure.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.959
You look nice and rested.

02:57.959 --> 03:02.042
Oh, you ----ing bitch.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.459
Bravo, Jess...

03:03.459 --> 03:05.334
leaving us three hours
before a charter

03:05.334 --> 03:07.083
when I could have called
someone in yesterday?

03:07.083 --> 03:09.250
Captain Lee, Heather.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.876
I'm ----ing pissed.

03:10.876 --> 03:12.459
Do you have a moment
in the bridge?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.000
Heather, meet me in
the bridge in five.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.042
Copy that, Captain Lee.

03:20.042 --> 03:22.292
You wanna sit for a minute?

03:22.292 --> 03:25.417
Because it's the last minute
we'll have for a while.

03:25.417 --> 03:28.501
Jess just pulled me aside
and said, "I'm gonna leave."

03:28.501 --> 03:30.417
Oh, my God.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.876
Captain Lee doesn't
even know yet.

03:32.876 --> 03:34.584
Am I shocked?

03:34.584 --> 03:35.584
-No.
-I am.

03:35.584 --> 03:39.375
As much as previously
I was for getting rid,

03:39.375 --> 03:42.375
right now I'm feeling
the reality of the situation.

03:42.375 --> 03:44.375
We have a full charter arriving,

03:44.375 --> 03:48.000
and we have two stews
to do the role of three.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.209
We're not in a good place.

03:49.209 --> 03:50.250
This is really worrying.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.292
-We've got this.
-Okay?

03:52.292 --> 03:54.792
Okay.

03:54.792 --> 03:57.125
As soon as she walked up in
her sweatpants, I knew it.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.959
Ah, yeah.

03:58.959 --> 04:12.209
Are you ----ing kidding me?

04:12.209 --> 04:13.834
Safe travels
and stay in touch, okay?

04:13.834 --> 04:16.876
Thank you.

04:16.876 --> 04:18.959
I've got it.

04:18.959 --> 04:23.709
I'm already putting these people
in a predicament by leaving.

04:23.709 --> 04:25.083
There's only a few hours

04:25.083 --> 04:26.584
before they're picking
up another charter.

04:26.584 --> 04:28.250
Sorry, Heather.

04:28.250 --> 04:31.584
So, I don't wanna make this
any bigger than it needs to be.

04:31.584 --> 04:34.042
I just kinda wanna, like,
get my stuff, get out,

04:34.042 --> 04:37.959
and let these people
go about their day.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.751
As soon as we're done
cleaning up there,

04:39.751 --> 04:41.125
put the jet-skis in the water,
put the rescue tender back out.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.334
Is the rescue tender
up there, still?

04:42.334 --> 04:44.918
Yeah.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.626
Sorry, not sorry.

04:46.626 --> 04:52.292
Don't let the passerelle hit
you on your ass on the way out.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.751
All right, stop for a second.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.000
Oh, I'm just gonna luff up.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.083
Good, paying attention...

04:57.083 --> 04:58.584
I love that.

04:58.584 --> 04:59.584
Good morning.

04:59.584 --> 05:00.709
How you doing, kiddo?

05:00.709 --> 05:02.626
-Should I let you take over?
-Yeah, let me take over.

05:02.626 --> 05:05.959
I just woke up to Jessica
coming out in her pajamas,

05:05.959 --> 05:07.417
asking to chat.

05:07.417 --> 05:08.417
Ah.

05:08.417 --> 05:10.834
She's already walked her
sweet ass off the yacht.

05:10.834 --> 05:13.334
She didn't even
gimme 10 seconds.

05:13.334 --> 05:14.667
Okay.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.334
I don't think I've ever
had a crew member

05:16.334 --> 05:18.209
leave without saying something,

05:18.209 --> 05:20.584
like bye, [bleep] you,
go to hell.

05:20.584 --> 05:24.709
I did expect more out of Jess
than just the silent departure.

05:24.709 --> 05:27.751
This is as ----ed up as
a Georgia road lizard.

05:27.751 --> 05:29.209
Let me get Eddie in here.

05:29.209 --> 05:30.918
Eddie, I need you
in the wheelhouse.

05:30.918 --> 05:33.501
Heck, maybe we'll actually
get that $3,000 tip this time.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.501
Yes, sir.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.501
Okay.
I got some bad news.

05:36.501 --> 05:39.584
Okay. What's happening?

05:39.584 --> 05:42.918
So, our third stew just
took a hike down the dock.

05:42.918 --> 05:43.918
She was just,
like, "I'm done."

05:43.918 --> 05:45.250
Yeah.

05:45.250 --> 05:48.209
That means somebody
from your crew

05:48.209 --> 05:50.000
are gonna have to do
some heads and beds.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.292
Can't I just, like, take my
stripes off and just put some,

05:52.292 --> 05:54.584
like, single-stripe
stew stripes on?

05:54.584 --> 05:57.667
[laughing]

05:57.667 --> 05:58.918
It's all gonna be okay.

05:58.918 --> 05:59.918
You have two seconds?

05:59.918 --> 06:01.125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.292
So, um, Jess just
walked up to me

06:03.292 --> 06:06.292
and told me that she could
never have anticipated

06:06.292 --> 06:08.459
how taxing this season
would be on her body.

06:08.459 --> 06:11.083
-Yeah?
-So, she's gonna depart.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.834
She actually just
left the yacht.

06:12.834 --> 06:14.250
Did she say "bye" to you?

06:14.250 --> 06:16.042
-No.
-Okay.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.209
She's a nice person, but if
you don't wanna be somewhere,

06:18.209 --> 06:19.334
you don't wanna be somewhere.

06:19.334 --> 06:21.292
-Yeah.
-That's how it is.

06:21.292 --> 06:23.542
She doesn't wanna say goodbye
to anybody, I'm fine with that.

06:23.542 --> 06:26.042
I like to say
[bleep] you before I leave.

06:26.042 --> 06:28.083
A vive la France
theme party with

06:28.083 --> 06:29.375
an elaborate, 10-course dinner.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.709
I don't play that game.
I'm out.

06:31.709 --> 06:33.501
I'll start packing now.

06:33.501 --> 06:34.918
Go [bleep] yourself.

06:34.918 --> 06:36.751
You know what, if
you're gonna bail, bail.

06:36.751 --> 06:39.083
Thanks, Rachel.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.626
This is some ----ed up sh--.

06:40.626 --> 06:42.792
Guys, bridge deck
aft for a meeting.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.918
-Copy.
-Okay.

06:44.918 --> 06:46.250
Little bit of bad news.

06:46.250 --> 06:50.751
Jess just quit
and walked off the boat.

06:50.751 --> 06:53.959
It's unfortunate,
she didn't even say goodbye.

06:53.959 --> 06:57.459
But it is what it is,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.459
and we got a job to do,
so we're gonna get it done.

06:59.459 --> 07:01.584
Yeah, it sucks she
didn't say goodbye or

07:01.584 --> 07:03.709
anything like that
and just tipped out.

07:03.709 --> 07:06.626
I wish she would have, you know,
at least waved, acknowledged.

07:06.626 --> 07:10.792
I absolutely thought
we had a connection, still do.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.292
It's unfortunate.

07:12.292 --> 07:13.667
We're gonna have more
work because of that.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.334
You know, they are gonna
need some help down below

07:15.334 --> 07:17.292
doing heads and beds,
definitely in the galley.

07:17.292 --> 07:18.292
I need that
from all you guys.

07:18.292 --> 07:19.501
-Copy that.
-Okay.

07:19.501 --> 07:21.334
Yeah, let's do it.

07:21.334 --> 07:24.042
Noon, but we're gonna be
leaving the dock at 10:00 a.m.

07:24.042 --> 07:25.209
Yeah, same thing.

07:25.209 --> 07:26.209
I think it'll be
a good charter.

07:26.209 --> 07:28.000
We'll get it done.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.250
What the [bleep].
I'm mad as hell.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.125
I mean, it's gonna suck
to have a man down, but...

07:32.125 --> 07:33.417
She was, like, one of
my best friends here.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.250
We got a lot more
work to do now.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.042
I thought she was gonna
thug it out, though, honestly.

07:37.042 --> 07:40.250
Jess leaving is
the worst timing ever.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.751
I feel like I'm having
other issues

07:41.751 --> 07:46.250
outside of work that's
affecting my work.

07:46.250 --> 07:49.709
And Eddie is just,
like, that shouldn't matter.

07:49.709 --> 07:50.959
I'm just over it.

07:50.959 --> 07:52.501
Like, absolutely over it.

07:52.501 --> 07:55.667
Why does it have
to be my roommate?

07:55.667 --> 07:57.167
Oh, this is gross.

07:57.167 --> 08:01.000
All crew, all crew,
provisions is here.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.709
Guys, there's a storm
that's about to roll through.

08:02.709 --> 08:03.792
It's about to pour.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.250
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, babe.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.834
Swedish hard cider.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.626
-Hello.
-Morning.

08:08.626 --> 08:14.751
Good morning, Rayna,
I didn't see you yet.

08:14.751 --> 08:18.876
Perfecto.

08:18.876 --> 08:20.083
Did you smell my basil?

08:20.083 --> 08:22.542
Oh, wow.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.334
Little bit.

08:24.334 --> 08:26.959
This is ----ing nice!

08:26.959 --> 08:28.792
Welcome to the Caribbean!

08:28.792 --> 08:34.459
Oh, blown off.

08:34.459 --> 08:37.542
I can't do anything
about the weather.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.918
That just kinda
sums up the morning.

08:39.918 --> 08:44.334
-It's so windy.
-I know.

08:44.334 --> 08:48.125
Hey-ya.

08:48.125 --> 08:53.083
Bring it down.
Keep coming.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.792
We're in a really good spot.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.292
I'm in, like, battle mode.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.417
I'm ready to ----ing
screw this bitch, you know?

08:58.417 --> 09:02.167
I'm 100 percent
with you right there.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.751
Passerelle is on board.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.417
So, we're gonna try
and get outta here.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.083
It looks like it's easing
up a little bit.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.501
Deck crew, get into position.

09:08.501 --> 09:10.417
Eddie, get ready to hop over

09:10.417 --> 09:12.709
and grab the tender
and the skis.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.083
Copy that, Cap.

09:14.083 --> 09:15.209
All right, let's
get outta here.

09:15.209 --> 09:17.709
Oh, get the [bleep] outta here.

09:17.709 --> 09:20.000
Stern 20 feet off.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.792
Port side 30 feet off.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.292
Stern clear of markers.

09:23.292 --> 09:28.626
Let's get the fenders in.

09:28.626 --> 09:31.125
That's all fenders in.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.459
What the [bleep]?

09:32.459 --> 09:33.959
-How are you feeling?
-I feel good.

09:33.959 --> 09:35.000
You're still
vacuuming downstairs.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.584
I've still got two cabins to do.

09:36.584 --> 09:37.876
Should I just do that,
and then I'll come and find you?

09:37.876 --> 09:39.209
Thank you, Fraser.

09:39.209 --> 09:41.000
On my mark,
I want two and a half shots.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.042
Copy that, Captain.

09:42.042 --> 09:50.417
And drop.

09:50.417 --> 09:51.876
Cap, that's
two and a half shots.

09:51.876 --> 09:54.209
Okay.
Lock it in, Jake.

09:54.209 --> 09:55.584
We ready for the slide?

09:55.584 --> 09:58.417
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:58.417 --> 10:01.250
I need a cigarette.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.876
All right, you can bring
her down two, please.

10:03.876 --> 10:06.000
If you wanna keep on doing
yours, I'll take this.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.751
You do the white one,
and I'll do this, yeah.

10:07.751 --> 10:08.959
Gotta keep running.

10:08.959 --> 10:13.250
Crew search,
interior, third stew.

10:13.250 --> 10:16.918
Where the [bleep]
are these ----ing trash bags?

10:16.918 --> 10:18.292
Ooh!

10:18.292 --> 10:19.542
-Oh, is that your head?
-Yeah, it's my head.

10:19.542 --> 10:20.542
Oh, my bad.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.667
-Ah!
-Ah!

10:22.667 --> 10:24.209
-Is that good?
-Yes.

10:24.209 --> 10:25.584
Ah!

10:25.584 --> 10:26.584
[bleep] yeah!

10:26.584 --> 10:27.834
That is literally perfect.

10:27.834 --> 10:31.167
Attention all crew, we have
20 minutes till guest arrival.

10:31.167 --> 10:35.542
-Let's go get changed.
-Thank you for my shirt.

10:35.542 --> 10:37.709
It'll be a good charter,
it'll be a good charter,

10:37.709 --> 10:41.834
it'll be a good charter.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.042
Look at this water.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.626
We made it, ladies and gent.

10:45.626 --> 10:47.292
I need all crew to the aft deck.

10:47.292 --> 10:48.334
Thank you.

10:48.334 --> 10:49.918
Get your asses back here.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.792
We've got people arriving.

10:51.792 --> 10:52.834
Copy, copy!

10:52.834 --> 10:54.125
We just need an extra tray.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.584
I should never be
the first one here.

10:55.584 --> 10:56.501
Come on.

10:56.501 --> 10:58.042
Heading to our next
home away from home.

10:58.042 --> 11:00.167
-You okay?
-Yeah.

11:00.167 --> 11:01.584
-Well, hey, there!
-Hey!

11:01.584 --> 11:03.751
You guys don't like
that hurry-up sh--, do ya?

11:03.751 --> 11:05.042
There we are, nice job.

11:05.042 --> 11:06.876
Oh, my God.

11:06.876 --> 11:08.584
-Hi there.
-Hi, how you doing?

11:08.584 --> 11:09.334
-Good.
-Hello!

11:09.334 --> 11:11.250
-Mm!
-Captain Lee.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.751
Chelsea, nice to meet you.

11:12.751 --> 11:13.751
Welcome on board.

11:13.751 --> 11:15.375
We're so screwed.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.000
We have eight guests coming on
with a list of things to do.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.042
Did I mention the lady
with her jaw wired shut?

11:23.042 --> 11:24.209
Yeah, I'll get you one
as soon as possible.

11:24.209 --> 11:26.959
I have to ask...
is that a broom?

11:26.959 --> 11:29.959
Yeah, her name
is Sally, she's magic.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.167
Okay.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.751
And on top of that,
first charter

11:32.751 --> 11:35.209
I've ever had a witch on.

11:35.209 --> 11:37.250
I'm just hoping that
Sally and Rachel

11:37.250 --> 11:40.876
can brew me up a new stew.

11:40.876 --> 11:42.209
Coming up...

11:42.209 --> 11:45.417
Eggs for breakfast.

11:45.417 --> 11:49.417
Whatever we're eating,
liquefy it.

11:49.417 --> 11:49.417
Like, what the [bleep]?

11:49.417 --> 11:57.375
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

11:57.375 --> 11:59.834
Heather is gonna
show you around on the yacht,

11:59.834 --> 12:01.667
and we'll get the party going.

12:01.667 --> 12:02.667
-Hey!
-Thanks.

12:02.667 --> 12:03.667
Cheers.

12:03.667 --> 12:08.417
Well, let's take a tour.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.417
Okay.

12:10.417 --> 12:11.626
Oh, yeah.

12:11.626 --> 12:13.375
Straw.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.918
I'm gonna speak with her
before lunch service.

12:14.918 --> 12:16.292
Okay.

12:16.292 --> 12:17.626
I'm gonna be making
her purees and soups.

12:17.626 --> 12:18.792
Works for me.

12:18.792 --> 12:20.042
Okay.

12:20.042 --> 12:25.250
We'll come on up this way.

12:25.250 --> 12:31.209
I have two selections for you.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.042
Exactly.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.626
Amazing.

12:33.626 --> 12:37.000
I don't know how anyone
could get their jaw wired shut

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
and then go on
a girls' trip.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.250
This should be very...

12:40.250 --> 12:44.501
[imitates jaw wired shut]
interesting.

12:44.501 --> 12:45.584
Where's everybody else?

12:45.584 --> 12:46.667
Finishing uncovering.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.292
Ah.

12:48.292 --> 12:50.459
Guests are coming on board,
and you're still uncovering?

12:50.459 --> 12:52.792
And you're not even
down a person.

12:52.792 --> 12:54.584
You can't start out
a charter that way.

12:54.584 --> 12:56.626
Then it's catch-up for
the rest of the charter,

12:56.626 --> 12:58.626
and it only gets
progressively worse.

12:58.626 --> 13:02.667
So, my patience level is
almost transparent right now.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.375
All right, crow's nest.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.709
We'll come on up this way.

13:06.709 --> 13:08.584
So, this is bridge deck aft.

13:08.584 --> 13:10.584
This is where you'll be
enjoying a lot of your meals,

13:10.584 --> 13:12.918
if you choose.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.584
Oh!

13:14.584 --> 13:17.459
For obvious reasons,
this level's called the sundeck.

13:17.459 --> 13:21.709
Oh... oh, God, my skirt's gonna
be flying up, I apologize.

13:21.709 --> 13:24.918
-Let's give you space.
-I have underwear on.

13:24.918 --> 13:27.918
And if you follow me up one
more flight of stairs...

13:27.918 --> 13:30.334
Oh, nice!

13:30.334 --> 13:32.501
Whew.

13:32.501 --> 13:34.792
Mark that one down,
finishing uncovering your...

13:34.792 --> 13:35.792
Well, they didn't see it.

13:35.792 --> 13:36.918
Got it before they got up there.

13:36.918 --> 13:38.792
Not good.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.125
The master stateroom.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.125
-Oh, my God.
-Wow!

13:41.125 --> 13:42.792
It's so pretty!

13:42.792 --> 13:46.667
I feel like if I have too many
cocktails, I might get lost.

13:46.667 --> 13:47.667
We uncovered?

13:47.667 --> 13:49.000
-Yeah.
-Yes.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Okay, let Wes know to
get in his blues.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.417
-Wes.
-Yeah?

13:51.417 --> 13:52.626
We're gonna go get
changed into blues.

13:52.626 --> 13:53.626
-Copy.
-Double-time it.

13:53.626 --> 14:02.667
-Yep.
-Double-time.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.626
----ing hungry as sh--.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.000
Lunch soon, maybe in, like,
an hour and a half or so.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.083
What are you thinking?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.501
Of course.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.167
I feel like we're all gonna
get, like, killer calves

14:14.167 --> 14:16.334
and thighs at the end of this.

14:16.334 --> 14:17.292
Hi.

14:17.292 --> 14:19.792
Hi, I'm so sorry go
hear about your injury.

14:19.792 --> 14:25.459
So, for breakfast...

14:25.459 --> 14:28.375
Mm-hmm.

14:28.375 --> 14:29.918
Mm-hmm.

14:29.918 --> 14:32.042
We've tried, like, whatever
we're eating, to liquefy it...

14:32.042 --> 14:33.250
Right.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.542
And see how it goes,
so she can enjoy

14:34.542 --> 14:36.000
-the same stuff we're having...
-Right.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
but just do the transition.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.459
-Yeah.
-Okay.

14:38.459 --> 14:41.292
I've had a guest had a
jaw wired shut before.

14:41.292 --> 14:42.959
They have to
eat constantly

14:42.959 --> 14:45.959
because the fact that they're
not ingesting solid foods.

14:45.959 --> 14:47.375
It's a lot.

14:47.375 --> 14:48.834
I'm, like...
I'm so bummed about your food...

14:48.834 --> 14:50.125
-That's okay.
-but I'm...

14:50.125 --> 14:51.667
I get to taste it liquidly,
you know?

14:51.667 --> 14:53.334
But now I'm finding out that
she really actually

14:53.334 --> 14:56.292
wants every single
course that all the guests have

14:56.292 --> 14:58.959
blended in liquidized form.

14:58.959 --> 15:03.292
[laughs]
Like, what the [bleep]?

15:03.292 --> 15:09.125
-Yeah.
-It's our pleasure.

15:09.125 --> 15:13.292
Come on, girl.

15:13.292 --> 15:15.542
If you can stand in the rain
and in the wind,

15:15.542 --> 15:18.000
in Oregon, then you
can definitely do that.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.334
Is she here to clean?

15:19.334 --> 15:20.918
Maybe she's the new stew,
who knows.

15:20.918 --> 15:23.501
She definitely seems like
she's, like, clairvoyant,

15:23.501 --> 15:26.250
so maybe she just got the
memo before any of us did.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.292
I'm oddly turned on,
in a weird way.

15:27.292 --> 15:28.876
It gets ya going, huh?

15:28.876 --> 15:31.709
Like, oh, yeah, you gonna
spank me with your magic broom?

15:31.709 --> 15:33.375
Is that what you like, yeah?

15:33.375 --> 15:34.334
Oh, Sally.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.334
----ing weirdo, dude.

15:36.334 --> 15:38.000
You play this whole nice
guy act, but in reality,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.125
you're just a plain old
freak, aren't you?

15:41.125 --> 15:42.834
There's a little
hole in the glass.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.626
I think there's a
slow leak in it.

15:44.626 --> 15:45.626
Oh, gosh.

15:45.626 --> 15:46.626
I might have a little leak, too.

15:46.626 --> 15:47.626
Have you got one too?

15:47.626 --> 15:48.834
Right, leaks all around.

15:48.834 --> 15:53.918
-Thank you.
-Glad to help.

15:53.918 --> 15:55.000
Just for those leaks.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
No worries.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
-Cheers, girls.
-Cheers!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.417
We made it.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.000
I'm gonna quickly
run down and change.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.918
I just wanted to let you know,
then we'll swap out.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.125
-You look beautiful.
-Huh?

16:04.125 --> 16:05.667
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

16:05.667 --> 16:09.626
All right, you go.

16:09.626 --> 16:14.000
[cackles]

16:14.000 --> 16:15.501
Eddie, Eddie, Lee.

16:15.501 --> 16:17.876
We should probably pop
that snubber on, please.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.042
Copy that.

16:19.042 --> 16:21.334
Can I do it?
I'm great at it.

16:21.334 --> 16:22.834
You can do it, and I'll watch.

16:22.834 --> 16:25.209
Yeah, cool.
I like that.

16:25.209 --> 16:28.209
I'm gonna set up all
the cheese out here.

16:28.209 --> 16:30.667
Hey, deck crew,
when someone has a chance,

16:30.667 --> 16:32.417
would they help me move
one of the chairs

16:32.417 --> 16:34.584
out of the way so we
can set for lunch?

16:34.584 --> 16:36.042
Rayna's on the way.

16:36.042 --> 16:37.918
Copy, thank you.

16:37.918 --> 16:44.083
Ugh!

16:44.083 --> 16:45.334
I don't know why you
guys have been putting

16:45.334 --> 16:46.459
that chair at the head
of the table...

16:46.459 --> 16:49.959
Just behind your bar, usually.

16:49.959 --> 16:51.375
Yeah, thank you.

16:51.375 --> 16:54.042
We're short-handed,
so I appreciate it.

16:54.042 --> 16:55.709
This is perfect, thank you.

16:55.709 --> 16:58.834
Hummus and some fresh pita,
but the pita's not gluten-free.

16:58.834 --> 17:10.959
-Okay.
-So, just note that.

17:10.959 --> 17:12.876
[chattering]

17:12.876 --> 17:14.250
I'm scared, I'm scared!

17:14.250 --> 17:15.751
Don't be a ----ing pussy.

17:15.751 --> 17:16.751
Come on...

17:16.751 --> 17:18.000
Oh!

17:18.000 --> 17:19.751
Come on, do it again!

17:19.751 --> 17:21.000
Give it to me, Cheffy!

17:21.000 --> 17:24.417
Oh!

17:24.417 --> 17:26.667
No.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.209
Should have known.

17:28.209 --> 17:30.417
I'm sweating like a
bulldog right now.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.667
Chef Rachel, I'm sitting
the guests at the table.

17:32.667 --> 17:33.542
Copy.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.042
Could I offer you
a papadam or a naan?

17:36.042 --> 17:38.584
Oh, please, thank you.

17:38.584 --> 17:40.334
That's really tasty.

17:40.334 --> 17:41.959
Oh, what are the little
sauces with it?

17:41.959 --> 17:43.626
It's really good,
it's like a mint pesto.

17:43.626 --> 17:44.959
It's so good.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.125
-It's really good, yeah.
-It's really...

17:46.125 --> 17:47.459
Michael, you wanna
try the coconut?

17:47.459 --> 17:53.667
It's very good.

17:53.667 --> 17:54.626
Yeah.

17:54.626 --> 17:57.459
Do you wanna go take
a break and come back?

17:57.459 --> 18:09.417
Aw!

18:09.417 --> 18:16.918
Coming up...

18:16.918 --> 18:16.918
----ing amateur hour.

18:16.918 --> 18:26.792
Heather is gonna
show you around on the yacht,

18:26.792 --> 18:29.375
Yeah.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.876
Do you wanna go take
a break and come back?

18:31.876 --> 18:38.918
Aw!

18:38.918 --> 18:40.083
Since we left this
morning, right?

18:40.083 --> 18:46.626
-Fraser?
-Yes.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.083
Yeah.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.209
Thank you so much.

18:51.209 --> 18:52.918
-Heather?
-Yes.

18:52.918 --> 18:54.292
Primary urgently needs food.

18:54.292 --> 18:55.959
She says she really
needs to eat now.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.709
Everyone's freaking out at
the table, so can we get...

18:57.709 --> 18:59.042
I don't know
if something's coming up.

18:59.042 --> 19:00.626
She's like, literally now.

19:00.626 --> 19:02.375
We've gotta get
Chelsea some food first, y'all.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.334
We've all eaten,
our darling hasn't.

19:05.334 --> 19:07.542
The reason we're here,
she hasn't, because of her jaw.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.542
So, we're trying to get
her some food right now.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.959
Primary needs to eat right now,
right this second.

19:11.959 --> 19:12.959
She wants hers in her glass.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.125
She has not...

19:14.125 --> 19:17.626
That's what I'm doing right now.

19:17.626 --> 19:25.375
Oh, I bet.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.125
It's on its way now.
It's on its way.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.542
Okay, yeah.
Her first, always.

19:28.542 --> 19:32.083
-Of course, of course.
-Yeah, thank you.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.167
What's going on?

19:34.167 --> 19:35.709
I need to eat.

19:35.709 --> 19:37.876
I'm gonna go with this first,
and then go from there.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.375
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:39.375 --> 19:40.542
She just looked at me and
said, "Her first, always."

19:40.542 --> 19:42.125
-So, primary always.
-Okay.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.834
Always serve her soup first.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.000
-Yeah.
-Got it.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.876
-That's ready to go.
-Beautiful.

19:47.876 --> 19:48.876
And then I'll plate them now.

19:48.876 --> 19:50.375
Cool.

19:50.375 --> 19:51.667
Just tell her that it takes
a little while for me

19:51.667 --> 19:52.959
to keep straining it
and straining it.

19:52.959 --> 20:00.250
Okay.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.709
-Ooh!
-Yay!

20:01.709 --> 20:02.959
-Thank you.
-Mami!

20:02.959 --> 20:04.209
Our sincerest apologies.

20:04.209 --> 20:05.292
She was just straining
it a bunch.

20:05.292 --> 20:06.626
No worries, thank you so much.

20:06.626 --> 20:07.959
[sighs]

20:07.959 --> 20:09.000
How are you guys doing?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
-Lovely.
-Good.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.959
-Amazing.
-Perfect.

20:11.959 --> 20:12.959
How is it?

20:12.959 --> 20:15.000
Is it savory?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.292
For your first course,
chilled butternut squash soup

20:17.292 --> 20:18.501
with dukkah spice.

20:18.501 --> 20:20.542
-Yum!
-That's delicious.

20:20.542 --> 20:21.876
So, delicious.

20:21.876 --> 20:24.042
-You okay?
-Yep, you okay?

20:24.042 --> 20:26.501
-I'm ----ing swell.
-Swell.

20:26.501 --> 20:28.375
As first officer,
I've got someone down,

20:28.375 --> 20:29.667
it's my responsibility
more than ever

20:29.667 --> 20:31.751
to kinda get in there
and help out.

20:31.751 --> 20:33.125
I wash dishes all the time.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.375
I don't have a dishwasher
in my apartment.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.459
Could I get a glass of OJ?

20:36.459 --> 20:37.417
Copy that.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.751
I knew you weren't just
another pretty face.

20:39.751 --> 20:43.042
I don't actually work here,
I'm just a model.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.459
Hair model?

20:44.459 --> 20:46.209
My first job was a
dishwasher at a yacht club,

20:46.209 --> 20:47.542
scrubbing pots and pans.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.292
-Beautiful, thank you.
-You're welcome.

20:49.292 --> 20:52.417
Worked on dinner cruise boats,
cleaned up vomit and poop.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.918
[gags]

20:53.918 --> 20:56.042
Good times.

20:56.042 --> 20:57.501
-Did you enjoy that?
-I did, thank you.

20:57.501 --> 21:00.876
-Beautiful.
-Thank you.

21:00.876 --> 21:05.751
This is taking a few minutes.

21:05.751 --> 21:07.292
Would you mind blending this?

21:07.292 --> 21:09.626
This is gonna be interesting,
to be honest with you.

21:09.626 --> 21:16.334
It's important to keep
hydrated, my friends.

21:16.334 --> 21:18.292
Like, we could just roll
right into dinner right now.

21:18.292 --> 21:23.751
-I know, truly.
-Yeah.

21:23.751 --> 21:25.125
It's really a hard process.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.375
I have to add liquid
to emulsify it,

21:27.375 --> 21:29.000
but at the same time, too,

21:29.000 --> 21:30.709
I can't lose the integrity
of the flavor.

21:30.709 --> 21:33.250
It's not just a hey,
I'm gonna toss your sh--

21:33.250 --> 21:36.000
in a blender and ----ing
serve it to you with a straw.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.167
There's more.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.667
-Yay!
-Thank you.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.167
Wow, oh, my gosh.

21:40.167 --> 21:41.626
Round of applause for Rachel!

21:41.626 --> 21:42.626
Woo!

21:42.626 --> 21:43.626
Thank you, everyone.

21:43.626 --> 21:45.292
This looks beautiful.

21:45.292 --> 21:46.959
It's gonna take me just a
little bit to get used to, like,

21:46.959 --> 21:48.209
doing this with the courses,
but I'm actually really excited.

21:48.209 --> 21:49.417
There's lobster in there.

21:49.417 --> 21:50.125
Awesome.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.834
You've got a lobster smoothie.

21:51.834 --> 21:53.626
-Enjoy.
-This is fabulous.

21:53.626 --> 21:56.167
-Yeah, it is.
-Good, Chels?

21:56.167 --> 21:57.501
Yeah, it's just like
what we're eating.

21:57.501 --> 22:00.501
That's good.

22:00.501 --> 22:01.542
So delish.

22:01.542 --> 22:02.459
Yeah.

22:02.459 --> 22:05.751
I could do with a little break.

22:05.751 --> 22:07.709
Or just a cigarette.

22:07.709 --> 22:09.584
Yeah, man, this sucks.

22:09.584 --> 22:16.125
I wish Jess stayed.

22:16.125 --> 22:17.250
You guys are annoying
as [bleep].

22:17.250 --> 22:19.751
I hope she's a lesbian.

22:19.751 --> 22:21.542
Not for me, just so you guys

22:21.542 --> 22:23.834
don't even have anything
to be excited about.

22:23.834 --> 22:25.250
Oof.

22:25.250 --> 22:27.000
I think I'm heading
towards a food coma.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.501
Really delicious.

22:28.501 --> 22:30.042
Can I get you ladies anything
else at the moment?

22:30.042 --> 22:31.042
I think we're gonna
probably try and...

22:31.042 --> 22:32.501
Jump in and...

22:32.501 --> 22:33.834
Go down the slide and
get into a jet-ski, and...

22:33.834 --> 22:35.167
Oh, heck, yeah.

22:35.167 --> 22:36.501
I'm gonna go put
my bathing suit on.

22:36.501 --> 22:37.834
Guests are about
to start getting ready

22:37.834 --> 22:38.834
to do some water sports.

22:38.834 --> 22:39.918
Copy that.

22:39.918 --> 22:41.250
You wanna go on a jet-ski, baby?

22:41.250 --> 22:43.292
Who's driving, you driving?

22:43.292 --> 22:44.626
That's what I'm talking about!

22:44.626 --> 22:45.959
Have fun, girls!

22:45.959 --> 22:47.918
Ah!

22:47.918 --> 22:49.375
I love it.

22:49.375 --> 22:52.501
Ah!

22:52.501 --> 22:53.501
Ah!

22:53.501 --> 22:56.125
Yeah!

22:56.125 --> 23:00.459
Woohoo!

23:00.459 --> 23:07.042
[laughing]

23:07.042 --> 23:10.501
What the [bleep]?

23:10.501 --> 23:13.000
Oh, my God.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.334
What'd you do?
Something gone missing?

23:18.334 --> 23:23.709
----ing amateur hour.

23:23.709 --> 23:26.959
Something gone missing?

23:26.959 --> 23:28.792
Rayna's on the swim platform.

23:28.792 --> 23:32.000
She should be taking a
mental inventory all the time,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.334
make sure we're not having
a $25,000 piece of equipment

23:34.334 --> 23:36.501
just go floating off
into the sunset.

23:36.501 --> 23:38.709
Bush league sh--.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.042
How was that clipped on?

23:40.042 --> 23:41.167
-How it normally is.
-No, it wasn't.

23:41.167 --> 23:44.459
I don't know.

23:44.459 --> 23:47.375
I keep waiting to see
the white wizard walking down

23:47.375 --> 23:52.042
the passerelle with his
blue sunglasses on, just...

23:52.042 --> 23:54.167
[sighs]

23:54.167 --> 23:55.417
What happened there?

23:55.417 --> 23:56.792
-Down clip.
-I'm assuming so.

23:56.792 --> 23:58.834
God, don't let him come out.

23:58.834 --> 24:00.834
Turned out to be a pretty day.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.209
Thanks for the eyes.

24:02.209 --> 24:03.834
-Make sure it's clipped on...
-No, it...

24:03.834 --> 24:05.000
And keep your eyes out for it.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.542
Eye on it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:06.542 --> 24:07.792
Because I should not be the
one to have noticed that.

24:07.792 --> 24:08.792
Yeah, very true.

24:08.792 --> 24:10.083
All right, are you ready?

24:10.083 --> 24:11.667
We have three parties
to throw tonight.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.584
We're gonna pack for
the beach party,

24:13.584 --> 24:15.167
and then I need to start
setting for the pink party,

24:15.167 --> 24:16.375
and then I've gotta set
for dinner,

24:16.375 --> 24:17.709
and then we gotta
set the beach.

24:17.709 --> 24:21.918
Why do we let them decide
what they do?

24:21.918 --> 24:28.501
[shouting]

24:28.501 --> 24:29.667
-Oh, my God.
-Who's going to the beach?

24:29.667 --> 24:31.209
-Me and Jake.
-Then pack up.

24:31.209 --> 24:36.250
-Is that ice?
-Yeah.

24:36.250 --> 24:37.417
-I'm ready.
-Go for it.

24:37.417 --> 24:39.459
-Gracias.
-Get it, get it, get it.

24:39.459 --> 24:41.167
Wes is, like,
cheering inside.

24:41.167 --> 24:42.751
He's like,
"Thank God, it's my boat."

24:42.751 --> 24:46.209
Going crazy, I get the boat
to myself. [bleep] yeah!

24:46.209 --> 24:49.000
Never been this happy.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.667
We'll just leave
it all here for now.

24:51.667 --> 24:55.125
Yikes.

24:55.125 --> 24:59.292
...and it's gonna be a
massive rave, basically.

24:59.292 --> 25:00.709
I'm a little bit jealous,

25:00.709 --> 25:02.292
because that is
my favorite kind of party.

25:02.292 --> 25:06.125
Music, hot girls,
get absolutely wankered.

25:06.125 --> 25:08.667
----ing hell, I wish
I could do that.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.042
Thanks, Eddie.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.709
You have, like,
the s'mores here,

25:11.709 --> 25:12.876
or drinks here.

25:12.876 --> 25:14.167
And Jake here.

25:14.167 --> 25:20.042
Sick.

25:20.042 --> 25:21.501
Wes, Wes, Eddie.

25:21.501 --> 25:22.709
Hey, Eddie, I'm ready for you.

25:22.709 --> 25:26.042
Go ahead.

25:26.042 --> 25:28.209
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Rachel.

25:28.209 --> 25:29.501
Yeah, go for Eddie.

25:29.501 --> 25:31.125
Hey, Eddie, I was gonna
ask you a question

25:31.125 --> 25:33.042
about the oyster-shucking.

25:33.042 --> 25:34.375
I'll be on my way.

25:34.375 --> 25:35.876
It's gonna be, like,
a full circle,

25:35.876 --> 25:37.375
do you think, or just a half?

25:37.375 --> 25:40.709
-Half.
-I think so too.

25:40.709 --> 25:43.834
Goddamn it, you son of a bitch.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.250
Hey!

25:45.250 --> 25:48.083
So, I know that it's not
a great night to do it.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.501
I need to shuck oysters today.

25:49.501 --> 25:50.542
Okay.

25:50.542 --> 25:52.876
For dinner at 7:00 on
the table, automatically.

25:52.876 --> 25:54.876
You know, I grew up
on the East Coast.

25:54.876 --> 25:55.918
Baltimore, we love our oysters.

25:55.918 --> 25:57.792
Oh!

25:57.792 --> 25:59.000
Hello, girls.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.459
Shucking oysters are dangerous.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.751
Really easy to put a knife
through your hand.

26:02.751 --> 26:04.209
Ow.

26:04.209 --> 26:07.250
And I've definitely shed
some blood on oysters

26:07.250 --> 26:08.417
[bleep] yeah.

26:08.417 --> 26:09.417
That was a tough one.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.083
Imagine Cap just looking at us?

26:11.083 --> 26:12.626
He probably is.

26:12.626 --> 26:14.250
So, what you've gotta do
is you've just gotta

26:14.250 --> 26:15.834
walk around, you've just
gotta do some pointing.

26:15.834 --> 26:17.125
Like, like that.

26:17.125 --> 26:19.334
Like, pretend your working,
oh, yeah.

26:19.334 --> 26:22.167
Yeah, you know he's
looking through the binoculars,

26:22.167 --> 26:23.751
-like oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
-I know.

26:23.751 --> 26:27.083
There we go.

26:27.083 --> 26:30.000
This is cute as [bleep].

26:30.000 --> 26:31.250
Come on!

26:31.250 --> 26:35.042
Can you [bleep] off, please?

26:35.042 --> 26:38.542
One and one-half,
one and one-half.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.584
Blimey.

26:40.584 --> 26:48.626
[sighing]

26:48.626 --> 26:50.834
I feel like I'm blowing
up a condom.

26:50.834 --> 26:55.083
What's going on?

26:55.083 --> 26:57.209
Yeah, of course.

26:57.209 --> 26:58.667
No, you're good.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.000
No, I've got...
I've got all the time in the...

27:00.000 --> 27:01.751
-Okay.
-Hi!

27:01.751 --> 27:03.584
Yeah.

27:03.584 --> 27:05.167
Of course, it'd be a pleasure.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.751
That'd be great.

27:06.751 --> 27:09.167
I've got this pink party,
I've got silent disco,

27:09.167 --> 27:18.959
I've got a bonfire, I've got
a lady with her jaw wired shut.

27:18.959 --> 27:20.626
It's honestly...

27:20.626 --> 27:22.167
that's why we're here,
because we love to do that.

27:22.167 --> 27:24.167
Let me stop the world,
make you your latte,

27:24.167 --> 27:26.959
and get right back to it.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.125
Marvelous.

27:28.125 --> 27:30.083
Rachel, she's ready to stand.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.626
-You think so?
-I think so.

27:31.626 --> 27:32.834
You wanna be in the sun?

27:32.834 --> 27:34.209
Like, what's up with you, girl?

27:34.209 --> 27:36.959
She can do it.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.334
She's doing her best.

27:39.334 --> 27:42.417
For the master, and lattes
I have to make right now,

27:42.417 --> 27:44.751
while I'm blowing up
balloons for the sky lounge.

27:44.751 --> 27:45.751
So, call me if you need me.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.083
Loving it.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.292
Let me know if you
need any help, okay?

27:48.292 --> 27:49.751
I just finished up with the...

27:49.751 --> 27:51.250
Yeah, blowing up some
balloons in the sky lounge

27:51.250 --> 27:53.334
-would be awesome.
-Perfect, gimme...

27:53.334 --> 27:55.709
Very nice shirt.

27:55.709 --> 27:59.209
I applaud you, Michael.

27:59.209 --> 28:01.709
All right, balloons!

28:01.709 --> 28:05.959
Some of them blow up
really weird.

28:05.959 --> 28:06.959
Like what?

28:06.959 --> 28:08.334
A condom.

28:08.334 --> 28:09.918
Oh, not the titty one,
just all the pink ones.

28:09.918 --> 28:11.167
Oh, it's a titty one? Oh.
I'm looking at this...

28:11.167 --> 28:12.792
You're looking like, what?

28:12.792 --> 28:17.042
It... it's... it's brown,
two circular shapes, yeah.

28:17.042 --> 28:20.459
So, that's the oat milk one.

28:20.459 --> 28:23.000
Enjoy, of course,
pleasure's all mine.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.501
Oh, this breeze is nice.

28:24.501 --> 28:25.918
Oh [bleep].

28:25.918 --> 28:27.250
Oh, scheisse!

28:27.250 --> 28:28.375
-No!
-Grab it!

28:28.375 --> 28:30.417
Wait, we could use Sally
to get it down.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.417
Yeah, where's Sally?

28:31.417 --> 28:32.584
Here, Sally can help.

28:32.584 --> 28:33.417
Brush her down.

28:33.417 --> 28:34.876
Oh, yeah, you got it.

28:34.876 --> 28:36.167
You got it, you're almost
there, sisterella.

28:36.167 --> 28:37.709
Yay!

28:37.709 --> 28:39.501
Woo!

28:39.501 --> 28:41.334
See how powerful Sally is?

28:41.334 --> 28:42.876
Eddie, Eddie, Jake,
we're done here.

28:42.876 --> 28:43.876
I'll come and pick you up soon.

28:43.876 --> 28:44.876
Die!

28:44.876 --> 28:47.375
-Bug?
-Spider.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.375
[helium voice]
That's just really fun.

28:49.375 --> 28:51.209
[helium voice]
If you can't have a cocktail,

28:51.209 --> 28:54.834
you might as well have a
puff of helium!

28:54.834 --> 29:00.000
[laughing]

29:00.000 --> 29:01.876
Well, that's not right.

29:01.876 --> 29:04.292
Wes! Wes!

29:04.292 --> 29:05.334
Wes, Wes, Eddie.

29:05.334 --> 29:06.709
Yeah, Eddie, go ahead.

29:06.709 --> 29:07.918
Can you come to the
swim platform, please?

29:07.918 --> 29:12.417
Copy that.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.209
Oh, he's towing the jet-ski.

29:14.209 --> 29:16.209
Don't tell let me
it got loose again.

29:16.209 --> 29:19.751
How?

29:19.751 --> 29:22.751
Wes, pull that ski in and get it
the [bleep] outta the way.

29:22.751 --> 29:23.584
Okay.

29:23.584 --> 29:25.501
Look like a bunch of
----ing idiots.

29:25.501 --> 29:27.501
This doesn't happen
two times in one day.

29:27.501 --> 29:28.751
I don't know what's going on,

29:28.751 --> 29:31.334
but I'm starting to feel
that maybe

29:31.334 --> 29:33.334
having a Wiccan on board
has something to do with it.

29:33.334 --> 29:35.626
We could be cursed.

29:35.626 --> 29:37.709
How'd it unclip?
Just randomly unclipped?

29:37.709 --> 29:39.542
It back-clipped itself.
I watched it.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.792
Like, I'm like, that line's
kinda leaning off weird,

29:41.792 --> 29:43.209
and there was just, like, clip.

29:43.209 --> 29:44.876
I guess I shouldn't have
talked sh-- on Sally,

29:44.876 --> 29:47.501
because I feel like Sally now
is coming back for vengeance.

29:47.501 --> 29:50.876
That's why everything
is going wrong.

29:50.876 --> 29:55.042
Woo!

29:55.042 --> 29:57.584
Gimme that line over here.

29:57.584 --> 29:59.542
Eddie said he watched
it unclip itself.

29:59.542 --> 30:02.375
It doesn't, unless it's
not clipped to begin with.

30:02.375 --> 30:04.375
It back-clipped on itself.

30:04.375 --> 30:05.751
I watched it come unclipped.

30:05.751 --> 30:07.626
Thirty-five years,
I've never seen it.

30:07.626 --> 30:10.667
Eddie can try and tell me all
he wants about back-clipping,

30:10.667 --> 30:12.667
but I think
it's somebody's inattention

30:12.667 --> 30:14.959
to detail that
caused the issue.

30:14.959 --> 30:16.292
That's pretty lame.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.626
I watched it fall off.

30:17.626 --> 30:23.792
That's bullsh--.

30:23.792 --> 30:26.792
Coming up...

30:26.792 --> 30:28.083
Okay, let me go take
that right back down.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.167
Thank you.

30:29.167 --> 30:40.751
[bleep] my life.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.501
It back-clipped on itself.

30:42.501 --> 30:43.709
-No.
-I watched it fall off.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.083
That's bullsh--.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.375
Talk to a hundred
----ing captains

30:48.375 --> 30:50.000
and ask them how many
----ing jet-skis

30:50.000 --> 30:51.501
they've lost to back-clipping.

30:51.501 --> 30:56.000
It's an excuse for
sloppy seamanship, period.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.375
Hi, Captain, how are you?

30:57.375 --> 30:58.667
How you doing, sweetie?

30:58.667 --> 31:00.626
-Sh--ty.
-Sh--ty?

31:00.626 --> 31:02.083
-Sh--ty.

31:02.083 --> 31:05.417
We look like a bunch
of ----ing idiots.

31:05.417 --> 31:07.209
When you're done back there,
Eddie,

31:07.209 --> 31:08.209
come on up to the bridge.

31:08.209 --> 31:10.584
Copy that, Cap.

31:10.584 --> 31:12.876
Goddamn it.

31:12.876 --> 31:15.292
Here you go.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.751
So, get this sh--.

31:16.751 --> 31:18.918
-Coming to pick you guys up...
-Yeah.

31:18.918 --> 31:22.125
And ----ing I watch
as a jet-ski unclips

31:22.125 --> 31:23.125
and ----ing
starts floating off.

31:23.125 --> 31:24.375
Yeah.

31:24.375 --> 31:25.375
There's something wrong
with that clip,

31:25.375 --> 31:26.459
and I clipped it exactly--

31:26.459 --> 31:27.876
No, it wasn't that...

31:27.876 --> 31:29.209
it wasn't that clip,
it was a different clip.

31:29.209 --> 31:30.459
-Oh, wow.
-It was the one that...

31:30.459 --> 31:31.292
Oh.

31:31.292 --> 31:32.250
Hi, ladies.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.501
Can I get you anything?

31:33.501 --> 31:35.501
Sure.

31:35.501 --> 31:36.209
Beautiful.

31:36.209 --> 31:37.834
Can I get a pillow
over here?

31:37.834 --> 31:39.083
How about a big pillow?

31:39.083 --> 31:42.459
â™ª Doo, do do do do do

31:42.459 --> 31:43.918
So, start getting
the toys in, guys.

31:43.918 --> 31:45.417
-Yep.
-Yes, sir.

31:45.417 --> 31:46.459
When I get back from
the principal's office...

31:46.459 --> 31:47.667
-Copy.
-We'll talk.

31:47.667 --> 31:53.626
Sorry.

31:53.626 --> 31:55.125
Did you hook them up?

31:55.125 --> 31:56.626
-No.
-I didn't think so.

31:56.626 --> 31:58.250
I did watch them
unclick, unclipped.

31:58.250 --> 32:02.083
Explain to me how
this happens again.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.417
So, with this,

32:04.417 --> 32:09.417
if it comes back
on itself and tightens.

32:09.417 --> 32:12.959
Give this to me again.

32:12.959 --> 32:14.417
And that's metal-on-metal.

32:14.417 --> 32:17.083
Captain Lee just
doesn't seem to wanna

32:17.083 --> 32:18.542
listen to my point of view.

32:18.542 --> 32:20.584
You know, I did major
in adventure education.

32:20.584 --> 32:25.751
Also, I'm the ----ing
first officer.

32:25.751 --> 32:27.292
As far as I'm concerned,

32:27.292 --> 32:29.334
I'm chalking it up
to human error.

32:29.334 --> 32:31.709
-Okay, Cap.
-Okay.

32:31.709 --> 32:33.709
Deck crew, deck crew,
I'm gonna get the davit set up

32:33.709 --> 32:36.042
to haul some jet-skis.

32:36.042 --> 32:38.000
See if they can get 'em up
here without losing them.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.083
Yep.

32:41.083 --> 32:42.083
All right, here we go.

32:42.083 --> 32:43.918
Flipping it, huh?

32:43.918 --> 32:46.083
Oh, my God, it's so pink!

32:46.083 --> 32:47.375
We'll just lift it.

32:47.375 --> 32:52.959
Oh, yeah, because that's
the smarter way.

32:52.959 --> 32:54.709
Don't let the sun on my face.

32:54.709 --> 32:57.501
Don't let the sun
go down on you?

32:57.501 --> 32:59.501
That'll do just marvelously.

32:59.501 --> 33:02.167
Hey, Fraser, do you just
wanna grab a quick bite to eat

33:02.167 --> 33:03.542
and change into your black?

33:03.542 --> 33:04.918
Copy.

33:04.918 --> 33:06.125
-Did I snore?
-Nope.

33:06.125 --> 33:07.501
Let's get into our blacks.

33:07.501 --> 33:08.834
Yeah, and there's
dinner downstairs, too.

33:08.834 --> 33:12.918
-Thank you, darling.
-Perfect, thank you.

33:12.918 --> 33:16.375
I'm Black as [bleep] bro.

33:16.375 --> 33:18.167
Get showered and blacks.

33:18.167 --> 33:19.209
-Do you want...
-Oh, blacks.

33:19.209 --> 33:22.417
-Yeah.
-Um... [sniffs]

33:22.417 --> 33:23.250
Oh!

33:23.250 --> 33:24.584
Oh, my glasses.

33:24.584 --> 33:27.250
That absolutely has to
be part of the outfit.

33:27.250 --> 33:30.834
-So pretty.
-So are you.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.209
Hey, mate.

33:32.209 --> 33:34.751
Today has been
the longest day of my life.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.125
There are times I can
see it on your face.

33:36.125 --> 33:38.667
And now I've got pink party.

33:38.667 --> 33:43.209
-No, dinner...
-Pink party, then disco.

33:43.209 --> 33:45.042
-No. Yeah.
-No.

33:45.042 --> 33:47.334
We've got beach...

33:47.334 --> 33:50.125
This day has not stopped.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.292
My legs hurt.

33:51.292 --> 33:53.250
Like, I can't feel my feet.

33:53.250 --> 33:55.626
I am losing my mind.

33:55.626 --> 34:00.751
But you know, we're going
to do what we do best,

34:00.751 --> 34:05.459
and we're going to make
magic happen, somehow.

34:05.459 --> 34:11.501
You know what,
I give up, I don't know.

34:11.501 --> 34:14.083
Another day,
another ass-reaming.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.334
It's not fun, dude.

34:16.334 --> 34:18.667
Back-clips happen;
not that often.

34:18.667 --> 34:21.250
Twice in a day?

34:21.250 --> 34:22.334
That's ----ing weird.

34:22.334 --> 34:24.000
I go to bat for
you guys, but

34:24.000 --> 34:30.584
don't put my ----ing head
on the Goddamn chopping block.

34:30.584 --> 34:32.250
I don't know how I just
pulled this party out of my ass,

34:32.250 --> 34:34.375
but everything's pink,
the table is set.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.083
Now I need to start
packing for the beach.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.417
All of your help.

34:37.417 --> 34:38.667
What time do you wanna go
to the beach?

34:38.667 --> 34:41.083
Let me just eat food...
brain power...

34:41.083 --> 35:13.959
and I will get back to you.

35:13.959 --> 35:49.751
I know, I get your point,

35:49.751 --> 35:52.501
You mother----er.

35:52.501 --> 35:53.918
Gor-geous.

35:53.918 --> 35:55.083
This is adorable.

35:55.083 --> 36:00.751
Oh, my gosh,
I love that dress.

36:00.751 --> 36:02.125
Hi, beauty!

36:02.125 --> 36:03.584
Good evening.

36:03.584 --> 36:05.918
Look at her, Miss Pink.
Beautiful.

36:05.918 --> 36:07.918
It's a pink party!

36:07.918 --> 36:09.417
Eddie, tonight before
dinner, I just need somebody

36:09.417 --> 36:11.000
to help me stage the platters.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.459
-Copy that.
-Copy, Rachel.

36:12.459 --> 36:14.292
-Rachel...
-Hey, sweetie-pie.

36:14.292 --> 36:15.334
-I love you.
-Yay!

36:15.334 --> 36:17.626
-Yay, hi.
-Give me a hug.

36:17.626 --> 36:19.375
So, let's lay the
sea glasses down,

36:19.375 --> 36:21.459
and we're gonna put all
the oysters on it in a minute,

36:21.459 --> 36:23.375
-and then dry ice.
-Perfect.

36:23.375 --> 36:24.876
I'm very excited to
be in the galley.

36:24.876 --> 36:26.542
For Thanksgiving,
I'm in charge of the turkey.

36:26.542 --> 36:29.375
I love cooking.
It's a huge stress-reliever.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.792
Let's make sure
that the lights come on.

36:31.792 --> 36:34.209
It's sad, but the only time
that I'm happy

36:34.209 --> 36:36.209
is at night in the galley.

36:36.209 --> 36:37.375
So, it's great.

36:37.375 --> 36:40.751
-Ah!
-[bleep]

36:40.751 --> 36:44.209
Oh, bad varnish job.

36:44.209 --> 36:45.584
Would anyone else
like a pink straw?

36:45.584 --> 36:48.209
-Anyone want a pink straw?
-Yeah, sure!

36:48.209 --> 36:52.000
Thank you.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.501
-Cheers.
-Happy birthday!

36:55.501 --> 36:59.918
Mwah!

36:59.918 --> 37:02.417
Every time we're going
into service for this group

37:02.417 --> 37:05.709
it's an arduous process.

37:05.709 --> 37:09.250
I have to blend her stuff up for
her to suck it down a straw.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.667
And that's some stupid sh--.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.959
So, for the first course,
cucumber gazpacho.

37:13.959 --> 37:15.626
Go ahead and start
filling them up.

37:15.626 --> 37:17.125
I'm gonna start
plating the platters

37:17.125 --> 37:18.292
with the seafood right now.

37:18.292 --> 37:20.292
If the guests are happy,
makes me happy,

37:20.292 --> 37:26.292
makes everybody
a happy chappie.

37:26.292 --> 37:28.584
So, this is a
cucumber gazpacho...

37:28.584 --> 37:29.459
Ooh, nice.

37:29.459 --> 37:33.834
-Made with coriander and mint.
-Enjoy!

37:33.834 --> 37:36.083
-Really good.
-Yum!

37:36.083 --> 37:40.751
Delish.

37:40.751 --> 37:42.417
Okay, let me go take
that right back down.

37:42.417 --> 37:44.083
-Thank you.
-My apologies.

37:44.083 --> 37:46.626
Go ahead and grab that platter
of oysters over there, Rayna.

37:46.626 --> 37:47.417
Awesome.

37:47.417 --> 37:49.083
She needs it to
be strained more.

37:49.083 --> 37:49.083
[bleep] my life.

37:49.083 --> 37:57.292
It back-clipped on itself.

37:57.292 --> 37:59.125
Then we're gonna
go ahead

37:59.125 --> 38:01.167
and juice some lemons
and the oranges.

38:01.167 --> 38:03.751
Oh, my God.

38:03.751 --> 38:07.501
She needs it
to be strained more.

38:07.501 --> 38:10.083
This can eat a ----ing dick.

38:10.083 --> 38:11.250
Ugh!

38:11.250 --> 38:14.584
Mm, delish.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.000
Okay.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.250
Fraser, can I get you to
the galley for service?

38:18.250 --> 38:22.501
Copy.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.042
She gave it a strain again.

38:24.042 --> 38:28.501
-Thank you.
-My apologies.

38:28.501 --> 38:30.042
-It's better.
-It's strained?

38:30.042 --> 38:31.334
Good.

38:31.334 --> 38:33.125
-Ready?
-Yeah.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.375
All-in-all, pretty good.

38:34.375 --> 38:37.209
-Wow.
-Wow.

38:37.209 --> 38:38.459
Look at the smoke.

38:38.459 --> 38:40.125
You have oysters on
the half-shell

38:40.125 --> 38:42.834
with a mignonette, and then
you have stone crab claw.

38:42.834 --> 38:45.834
Thank you.

38:45.834 --> 38:48.000
-I can't do it.
-Try it on the other angle.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.167
Ah!

38:49.167 --> 38:50.334
-Oh, yeah.
-You got it! You got it!

38:50.334 --> 38:51.667
-This is so good.
-Very good.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.292
-It's very good.
-Mm-hmm, delish.

38:53.292 --> 38:56.959
Jesus, look at the
size of this thing.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.375
That's an attention-getter.

38:58.375 --> 38:59.459
Eddie, Eddie, Fraser.

38:59.459 --> 39:00.709
Yeah, go ahead, Eddie.

39:00.709 --> 39:01.876
Do you have any crew
that could

39:01.876 --> 39:03.375
lend a spare hand in
housekeeping?

39:03.375 --> 39:04.501
Oh, my God, I'll do it.

39:04.501 --> 39:06.209
Yeah, coming.

39:06.209 --> 39:08.042
Have a good night, Cap, I'll
see you in the morning, okay?

39:08.042 --> 39:12.626
-Mm.
-So good.

39:12.626 --> 39:15.000
I know.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.501
Oh, ----ing awesome.

39:16.501 --> 39:17.834
When you pick up all the towels
that have been used...

39:17.834 --> 39:18.834
Yes.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.459
if you see any plates
or any cups or anything,

39:20.459 --> 39:21.626
could they just go to
the galley pantry?

39:21.626 --> 39:26.417
-Yeah.
-Thanks, guys.

39:26.417 --> 39:29.459
You're gonna get food right now.

39:29.459 --> 39:30.751
No, I'm not.
I'm just saying...

39:30.751 --> 39:31.959
You're gonna get food
right now.

39:31.959 --> 39:33.083
Yeah, liquid.

39:33.083 --> 39:39.626
Sorry, I'm in, like, focus mode.

39:39.626 --> 39:40.918
Go ahead, turn the juicer on.

39:40.918 --> 39:42.417
We'll put that one through.

39:42.417 --> 39:46.334
Heather, can we get some liquid
food for Chelsea ASAP?

39:46.334 --> 39:47.667
-Of course.
-Like, right away?

39:47.667 --> 39:49.667
-Yeah, of course.
-So, take these off...

39:49.667 --> 39:51.667
Rache, they just stopped
me and said

39:51.667 --> 39:53.459
we need to get Chelsea
food, like, right now.

39:53.459 --> 40:07.709
I could grab her
chicken right now.

40:07.709 --> 40:09.083
----ing nightmare.

40:09.083 --> 40:22.709
Oh, why tonight?
Why?

40:22.709 --> 40:24.334
-A hundred percent.
-Yeah, 100 percent.

40:24.334 --> 40:28.209
Oh, I cannot believe
that happened.

40:28.209 --> 40:34.959
Absolutely.

40:34.959 --> 40:36.125
Do we?

40:36.125 --> 40:41.918
I'm not sure about that.

40:41.918 --> 40:54.292
Take your time.

40:54.292 --> 40:56.459
Yeah, but you know what,

40:56.459 --> 41:09.042
unfortunately, that's not
where we're at right now.

41:09.042 --> 41:11.292
Later this season
on "Below Deck"...

41:11.292 --> 41:12.751
All systems go.

41:12.751 --> 41:13.751
Hey!

41:13.751 --> 41:15.167
Please keep all legs and
arms inside the vehicle

41:15.167 --> 41:16.626
unless you're Jake and Fraser.

41:16.626 --> 41:18.792
Then go ahead and
proceed to [bleep].

41:18.792 --> 41:20.667
It's just always good to
have a good old finger-bang

41:20.667 --> 41:24.167
before putting it in,
you know?

41:24.167 --> 41:28.459
Are they having a
threesome in Rayna's room?

41:28.459 --> 41:30.292
I think you
guys deserve a day off.

41:30.292 --> 41:32.250
Praise Jesus!

41:32.250 --> 41:33.375
Ha ha ha!

41:33.375 --> 41:36.959
Cheers, everybody.

41:36.959 --> 41:39.459
It's Jake's dick o'clock.

41:39.459 --> 41:42.459
The love triangle is weird.

41:42.459 --> 41:45.250
Can we have a baby,
all four of us together?

41:45.250 --> 41:50.584
That would be the
most ----ed up baby.

41:50.584 --> 41:51.626
Mm-hmm.

41:51.626 --> 41:53.000
The power of Christ compels you!

41:53.000 --> 41:54.709
The power of Christ compels you!

41:54.709 --> 41:57.667
We do have a new stew
that'll be joining us.

41:57.667 --> 41:59.584
You gotta train her, you gotta
get her familiar with the boat,

41:59.584 --> 42:03.167
all while we're in
the middle of service?

42:03.167 --> 42:04.459
Son of a bitch!

42:04.459 --> 42:06.125
I don't think that
was the best idea.

42:06.125 --> 42:07.792
-It's not.
-Well, what do you want?

42:07.792 --> 42:09.000
You want no help at all?

42:09.000 --> 42:12.083
It was her and nobody else.

42:12.083 --> 42:14.751
I do firmly believe
that the deck crew

42:14.751 --> 42:17.083
is spending way too much
time doing nothing.

42:17.083 --> 42:19.751
Get it in there, boy.

42:19.751 --> 42:20.918
Hello.

42:20.918 --> 42:25.459
Hm, this is interesting.

42:25.459 --> 42:29.125
Today? Right now? No.

42:29.125 --> 42:30.542
Was somebody gonna
----ing tell me?

42:30.542 --> 42:35.542
Obviously, Rayna's
upset about it.

42:35.542 --> 42:37.542
From the bottom of my
heart, I'm so sorry.

42:37.542 --> 42:40.584
I should have never said it.

42:40.584 --> 42:41.918
Woo!

42:41.918 --> 42:44.209
I've heard this whole experience

42:44.209 --> 42:47.292
is like doing anal for
the first time.

42:47.292 --> 42:49.751
Jesus, that burns!

42:49.751 --> 42:53.834
You're trying to smile,
but all you feel is pain.

42:53.834 --> 42:57.959
What the [bleep] is that
mother----ing thing?

42:57.959 --> 43:01.959
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
