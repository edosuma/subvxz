[Grace]  Ow!

00:48.339 --> 00:50.884
-Come on, you can do it!
-I'm doing it!

00:51.801 --> 00:52.635
Ow.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.222
I did it. I did it. I did it.

00:56.306 --> 01:00.310
Congratulations, Grace.
You walked the length of the couch.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.646
Next time would you keep your hands
out of my underpants?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.315
I mean, what were you doing back there?

01:05.397 --> 01:09.110
That is not the attitude
that's gonna get you to the fireplace.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.114
Well, what's the attitude
that'll keep you away from my ass?

01:13.198 --> 01:15.909
Oh, you are in fine form today.

01:15.992 --> 01:19.704
But you can't get me down.
I've got a whole day planned with Jacob.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.998
Also, I am high.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.333
Well, what's the big plan?

01:23.416 --> 01:26.252
Are you gonna eat too much kale
and pass out at a laser show?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.254
No, it's not Christmas.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.007
We're gonna go see the baby,
get some dinner,

01:31.090 --> 01:34.093
and then cuddle up
and watch several episodes of  Longmire.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.720
For somebody that hates guns,

01:35.804 --> 01:38.973
you sure do like to see guys
blow each other off their horses.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.266
Are we talking  Longmire?

01:40.725 --> 01:42.685
-Sure as shootin'.
-Hey.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.146
You know you have water damage
on your kitchen ceiling.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.106
-How long has it been like that?
-I don't know.

01:47.190 --> 01:51.236
Maybe since I got hooked
on that Diet Coke/Mentos geyser trick?

01:51.319 --> 01:54.072
I told you to take that act outside.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.616
Then I have to deal with wind factor,
bird strike.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.077
-Too many variables.
-Give me my pain pills.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.705
Are you gonna be okay without me today?

02:02.789 --> 02:06.334
I'm gonna be just fine.
Nick is stopping by in a bit.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.920
Oh, in your condition,
you cannot have sex.

02:10.003 --> 02:12.715
Only hand stuff, okay?

02:12.799 --> 02:15.510
Repeat after me: Only hand stuff.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.222
In a desperate attempt
to change the subject...

02:19.305 --> 02:20.682
this is a good one.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.767
I read it in our book club.

02:22.851 --> 02:26.688
-Since when are you in a book club?
-Since Winnie invited me to join hers.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.065
Winnie's the only friend
I made in Santa Fe.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.859
She's an extra on  Longmire.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.652
It shoots in Santa Fe.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.363
-Shouldn't you guys be gone by now?
-Right. Right.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.366
Listen, I want you to promise me
you're gonna get up and walk around.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.742
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.663
To tempt you, I've hidden little airplane
vodka bottles all around the house.

02:43.746 --> 02:47.500
Oh. Well, then I guess
I should get started.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.626
[Frankie] Aah!

02:49.335 --> 02:51.379
Yeah, you better get started.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.339
To the baby.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.134

03:25.830 --> 03:27.373
Now you won't even look at me?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.711
Thank you. I just want a chance...

03:31.794 --> 03:32.754
[disposal whirring]

03:32.837 --> 03:33.880
...to explain!

03:33.963 --> 03:37.258
What I said to Frankie
was after a long day

03:37.342 --> 03:39.260
and I had too much to drink and--

03:39.344 --> 03:43.348
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Every time we do, it just gets worse.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.225
But we have to talk about it.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.227
No, actually, we do not.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.396
You said what you said.
You can't un-say it.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.566
And I can't un-hear it.
We just have to live with it.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.487
I suppose I better call Joan-Margaret
and tell her not to come over.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.072
You will do no such thing.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.951
We haven't seen her in forever
and I'm very much looking forward to it.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.664
So... we're just going to smile
and pretend everything's okay?

04:07.747 --> 04:08.748
Yes.

04:08.831 --> 04:13.086
It kept my marriage together for 40 years,
it can keep us together for one lunch.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.464
And I will work on not doing that
while she's here.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.682
Are you accepting visitors?

04:26.307 --> 04:28.518
Are you tall, dark, and handsome?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.186
Two out of three ain't bad.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.563
Oh, thank you.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.149
God, I feel like I've won
the Kentucky Derby.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.655
We'll have you up and running
at Churchill Downs in no time.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.032
But till then, Kooky called to tell me

04:43.116 --> 04:45.660
we should take a little stroll
around the room.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.245
And to stop calling her Kooky.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.664
Come on, it'll be very Jane Austen.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.375
You know, I just walked
to the kitchen and back.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.336
Really? Is there something else
I can do for you?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.338
Actually, I am hungry.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.965
I'd love an omelet.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.050
Perfect. I'll have my chef come over.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.137
He will make you an omelet
that will blow your bra off.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.016
This is how you do it, isn't it?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.268
Nah, I got lots of ways to get bras off.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.854
No, I meant the way
you always get someone

05:12.937 --> 05:14.647
to take care of everything for you.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.066
Do you not understand what being rich is?

05:17.984 --> 05:19.652
Yeah. I'm just saying, you know,

05:19.736 --> 05:24.032
it might be nice if every once in a while,
you did something yourself.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.200
Well, all right, let's get that bra off.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.244
Frankie said only hand stuff.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.705
I know, she told me that, too.
That's why she called me.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.081
Still hungry.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.418
Fine. I'll make an omelet.
I've eaten a million of 'em.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.462
I can reverse-engineer it.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.464
Maybe just scrambled eggs.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.341
You'll be missing out
on my great omelet, but okay.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.304
[baby crying]

05:50.892 --> 05:52.226
Hi, Mom! Hi, Jacob!

05:52.310 --> 05:55.813
-Hi, Jacob! Hi, Frankie!
-Hey, guys.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.942
Oh, who's crying? Who's crying?

06:05.073 --> 06:08.242
So, um... how's everything going?

06:08.826 --> 06:11.120
Great! A little tense.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.415
My left eye's doing this thing.
But good. Good.

06:14.499 --> 06:18.002
Quick question, when was the last time
you've gotten any sleep?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.587
When was the last time we saw you?

06:19.670 --> 06:23.091
When we brought this little
piece of perfection into the world.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.634
-Day before that then.
-Yeah.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.303
Uh-oh. That's my girl.

06:27.386 --> 06:28.805
[crying stops]

06:28.888 --> 06:30.098
How did you do that?

06:30.181 --> 06:33.851
I've got the touch.
For babies and nunchucks.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.938
Jacob, this is our little goddess.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.314
[Jacob] Hey, you.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.316
She's beautiful.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.694
She doesn't have a name yet,
but there's no rush.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.988
She'll tell us what it is.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.824
Maybe it's Frankie.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.035
Now, how do we know
that she's actually asleep?

06:51.536 --> 06:53.538
Well, her eyes are closed.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.039
And she's sleeping.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.667
-Is this a trick question?
-What if she's faking it?

06:57.750 --> 07:00.044
Why would a newborn baby
fake being asleep?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.296
So she can hear
what we're saying about her.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.924
-Does anyone else smell cotton candy?
-Yes! That's what that is!

07:05.007 --> 07:07.093
These guys are unraveling.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.721
[sighs] All new parents unravel.
Don't you remember?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.223
-Oh, my God!
-What?!

07:12.723 --> 07:15.017
My finger just went into her skull!

07:15.101 --> 07:17.437
That was just the fontanel. It's fine.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.439
See? They need me.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.941
Can we just stay a bit longer?

07:22.024 --> 07:24.569
-Well, I was hoping we might--
-Come on, it'll be fun.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.195
My fontanel never closed.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.240
See? Fun!

07:30.825 --> 07:33.870
And then you add the onions
and the peppers and let it simmer.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.164
Thanks so much for helping me with this.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.208
And for lending me the pot
and all the ingredients.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.128
I want to make tonight
really special for Nadia.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.214
Look at you.
You light up whenever you say her name.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.466
I'm really proud of her.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.801
She aced her makeup effects final.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.889
Her teacher said he'd never met a student
that picked up varicose veins so quickly.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.184
Oh, you guys are gonna do it
so hard tonight.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.185
No!

07:57.727 --> 07:59.479
Why do you think I'm making chili?

07:59.562 --> 08:02.064
That's the most unromantic food
I could think of.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.774
You're still waiting?

08:03.858 --> 08:06.486
It's only a couple more weeks
till her first birthday.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.737
Then ding, ding, ding.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.907
You realize how gross that sounds?

08:13.117 --> 08:15.745
Her first AA birthday. God.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.706
No, the "ding, ding, ding" part.
What is that?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.336
Have you noticed that water damage
on the kitchen ceiling?

08:23.419 --> 08:26.255
-What's it with men and water damage?
-We're against it.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.551
Breakfast for lunch is served.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.471
Salmonella for lunch is served.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.058
Did you cook these?

08:38.142 --> 08:40.686
Well, I didn't want to dry 'em out.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.609
Mm.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.152
Yummy.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.242
Oh, come on, they can't be that bad.

08:58.746 --> 08:59.789
Mm.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.543
Hmm.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.837
-[Grace chortles]
-Tangy.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.589
[laughing]

09:08.673 --> 09:11.300
-You can spit them out. Here.
-I'd like to.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.516
-[Jacob] Oh...
-Et voilà.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.560
That's a damn good swaddle.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.812
I learned how to do a tight roll

09:22.895 --> 09:25.773
selling vegan burritos
at Grateful Dead concerts.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.401
Hey.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.320
[Frankie] Oh, the poor things.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.407
-There really is a lid for every pot.
-[chuckles]

09:35.032 --> 09:38.411
Hey, you want to go check out
Balboa Gardens before dinner?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.079
Oh, we can't leave yet.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.999
-Why not?
-Well, look at them.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.252
They haven't slept in four days.
They need a break.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.463
-What about us?
-We can be together here.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.008
I saw some Bagel Bites in the freezer.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.844
And we all know...

09:54.927 --> 09:58.306
that Bagel Bites are the prelude
to a rockin' good time.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.850
Well, I guess I can't argue with that.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.727
Oh, we could watch  Longmire.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.104
I know Bud's Netflix password.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.939
It's "I'm Bud," same as mine.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.984
I've been dying to, now that we know
who killed Lucian's wife.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.527
-What?
-What?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.903
We don't know that.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.780
Oh, yeah, right.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.823
I mean...

10:16.490 --> 10:18.451
we have our theories. [chuckles]

10:18.534 --> 10:22.246
Jacob, did you watch  Longmire
without me?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.373
I, um...

10:24.457 --> 10:26.083
might have seen a little.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.168
What?!

10:30.546 --> 10:31.422
[whispers] What?

10:31.505 --> 10:33.090
We only saw a few episodes.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.342
Who's "we"?

10:34.425 --> 10:38.054
Winnie. She wanted me to see the scene
where she's an extra buying potato chips,

10:38.137 --> 10:40.222
and we got sucked in.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.059
Understandable, it's  Longmire.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.771
But how could you watch our show
with another woman?

10:46.854 --> 10:48.272
It didn't mean anything.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.940
And she was terrible.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.110
I mean, really ate up the scenery
along with her potato chips.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.155
Where'd you and Winnie
watch our show?

10:56.947 --> 10:57.907
On the couch.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.660
She sat in my couch groove?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.578
I'd rather have you in your couch groove,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.497
but you keep canceling trips
to come see me.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.374
Because I was having a baby!

11:06.457 --> 11:07.833
[sighs]

11:07.917 --> 11:08.959
Fine.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.213
I'm sorry. I'll watch it again with you.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.841
What's the point? I already know
someone's buying potato chips.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.134
Frankie...

11:17.218 --> 11:19.387
You know, Grace asked me
to watch  Longmire  with her.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.388
No, she didn't.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.224
No, she didn't.
But if she had, I would've said no.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.101
Like you should've said no to Winnie.

11:25.184 --> 11:29.188
I should've done a lot of things,
like maybe not coming here.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.818
Where are you going?

11:33.901 --> 11:35.319
To Winnie's house?

11:35.403 --> 11:36.821
It's a thousand miles away.

11:36.904 --> 11:41.117
Oh, look who knows exactly
how many miles away Winnie's house is!

11:42.868 --> 11:43.828
I'll see you later.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.344
Compliments to the chef.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.346
I'll relay them to Toucan Sam.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.640
-[chuckles] Oh!
-[cell phone alarm rings]

12:05.182 --> 12:07.184
Time for you to go anywhere else.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.563
-Go, go! I've gotta change my bandage.
-Great, I can help.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.982
No, no, no! No, no, no, no.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.485
I need you to be
as far away from this as possible.

12:16.902 --> 12:17.737
Why?

12:18.320 --> 12:19.405
"Why"?

12:20.156 --> 12:23.909
You don't strike me
as a change-the-bandage kind of guy.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.163
-Hey, you didn't think I was an egg guy.
-You're not an egg guy.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.582
Because I'm too busy changing bandages.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.501
Come on. It's not a big deal.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.503
All right.

12:36.505 --> 12:37.381
Okay.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.102
I don't know what you're so worried about.
This doesn't look so bad.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.854
Oh, Jes--

12:54.023 --> 12:55.107
[chuckles]

12:56.233 --> 12:59.653
Joan-Margaret, I can't get over
how happy you look.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.781
Oh, I don't just look happy. I am happy.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.451
I am the happiest I have ever been.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.453
No more being told what to do.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.747
No more working for the boss-man.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.208
You know, we were your boss-men.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.002
Well, you know what I mean. I'm free.

13:15.085 --> 13:18.923
And I don't give a S-H-I-T anymore.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.384
I'm finally doing
all the shit I never did before.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.346
-[chuckles]
-I don't finish books I don't like.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.265
I eat fried food. I smoke.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.475
You don't smoke.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.144
I just started. It's fantastic!

13:32.228 --> 13:33.771
-Do you want one?
-Yes.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.731
-No, thanks.
-I mean no.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.567
Well, listen to me
just going on about myself.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
How are you boys enjoying retirement?

13:40.694 --> 13:42.696
It's great. I'm starring in  The Music Man.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.282
And I'm heavily involved
in local activism.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.536
I don't know if you've heard,
but I won a Tappy for my last show.

13:48.911 --> 13:49.912
I did hear that.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.913
You did?

13:51.497 --> 13:52.498
No.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.209
-Oh...
-And I started knitting P-hats.

13:55.292 --> 13:59.088
You can use the word "pussy" with me, Sol.
I'm cool.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.258
We've just been very busy.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.428
-And happy. Really happy. [chuckles]
-[Sol] Mm.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.849
Busy busy and happy happy.

14:12.059 --> 14:12.977
And...

14:13.519 --> 14:15.145
very, very busy.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.314
Cut the crap, boys.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.442
Let's talk about what's really going on.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.280
Can we smoke on the patio?

14:24.905 --> 14:27.449
-We don't really--
-Well, try and stop me.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.497
Did I pass out?

14:34.206 --> 14:35.207
[all] Yep.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.253
Grace, you didn't see what I saw.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.256
It's way worse
when you look at it straight on.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.427
-Back me up here, Mallory.
-We don't know each other that well.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.637
-I thought you were the nice one.
-[Bri] She is.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.348
But luckily,
the not-nice one does CrossFit

14:51.432 --> 14:53.893
and was able to pick you up
and put you on that couch.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.853
What? I do CrossFit.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.232
I say I do CrossFit-- Aah! Jesus-ah!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.984
See? It's not just me.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.861
Well, at least I remained upright.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.905
We are gonna get you up and walking.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.865
I don't think I can walk right now.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.367
I think she was referring to me,
Dr. Kildare.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.995
Oh, I'm sure you don't even know
who Dr. Kildare is.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.122
She's testing me. She's always testing me.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.834
-I'm not testing you. And you failed.
-I didn't fail anything.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.338
Just because I may or may not have fainted
does not mean I can't take care of you.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.549
You know what? I'm gonna text
my physical therapist

15:25.633 --> 15:27.509
to help you move around.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.802
Your guy makes house calls?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.472
Oh, he's got guys that make house calls
for everything.

15:32.139 --> 15:35.392
That's how he takes care of people,
he just calls one of his guys.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.437
Huh.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.190
What? What?

15:41.899 --> 15:44.818
The air must be really thin up there
on her high horse.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.112
-It's probably affecting her memory.
-[Mal] Mm.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.948
What are you talking about?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.533
When we were young and we'd get sick,

15:51.617 --> 15:54.036
you'd always "call in a guy"
to deal with us

15:54.119 --> 15:55.746
so that you didn't have to.

15:55.829 --> 15:56.956
Who?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.624
-Daddy!
-Dad!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.167
It's not that I couldn't.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.087
It's that I didn't want to.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.090
Yeah, you weren't exactly the kind of mom
we could give our gum to.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.051
-She made us swallow it.
-What am I, some kind of garbage can?

16:09.134 --> 16:12.596
It's like we're the same person.
I was a shitty parent, too.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.975
This is yet one more thing
we have in common.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.893
I was not a shitty parent!

16:18.602 --> 16:21.146
If I were, my daughters wouldn't have
dropped by to check on me.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.565
And you'd still be on the floor.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.694
Well, actually,
Frankie asked us to come over.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.987
There's a mom.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.034
Agh.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.414
[Bud] What are you doing over there?

16:38.497 --> 16:40.666
I'm on Winnie's Facebook page.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.210
Is there an I-Hate-Winnie button
on this thing?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.588
Who's Winnie?

16:47.297 --> 16:51.135
Just some background actress
angling for a leading part.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.386
Where's Jacob?

16:53.053 --> 16:54.388
He left.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.807
-Is everything okay?
-You'll have to ask Winnie.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.768
No, I'll ask Winnie.
I'm the one asking questions here.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.813
Mom, what's going on? Are you worried
about Jacob and this woman?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.815
I don't know what I'm worried about!

17:04.897 --> 17:08.277
I don't know what's going on
because I'm not in Santa Fe.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.280
I'm here. And now he's here, and I'm here.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.406
-I gotta get out of here.
-You can't go!

17:13.490 --> 17:16.242
Yeah, what if I put my finger
in her head again?

17:16.326 --> 17:19.121
What if she's allergic to peanuts
but she can't tell us?

17:19.204 --> 17:22.958
-We clearly don't know what we're doing.
-Here's a secret: nobody does.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.045
Except for whoever raised Regis Philbin.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.172
But I don't want to fuck it up.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.509
You will, but you're good people.

17:32.593 --> 17:36.096
No matter how much you fuck up,
Faith is gonna be okay.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.770
-Did she just name our baby "Faith"?
-[door opens, closes]

17:43.062 --> 17:44.313
I think she did.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.607
I think I like it.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.984
I think I like it, too.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.905
Hi, Faith.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.491
We're gonna fuck you up.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.159
[chuckles]

18:04.333 --> 18:05.167
Ouch.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.545
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.339
Oh, it looks so nice!

18:10.422 --> 18:12.091
You look nice!

18:12.633 --> 18:13.967
Thanks. Um...

18:14.051 --> 18:15.761
I have sparkling cider.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.471
Fancy!

18:17.888 --> 18:19.556
[Nadia] Oh-- Oh! Um...

18:20.641 --> 18:22.434
-I'm in the way.
-No.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.437
-I'm gonna...
-Okay.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.150
[Coyote exhales heavily]

18:35.447 --> 18:37.241
Is that a new cologne?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.079
-Beans.
-Beans.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.380
-There.
-There.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.422
Yeah.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.049
Salsa.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.223
-You need help with anything?
-No, no. I'm almost done.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.016
I've got it all under control.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.854
[grunts] Oh!

19:07.187 --> 19:10.941
Damn it! Another tomato disaster.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.783
Smells in here.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.494
Maybe I should wait outside.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.871
-That's a good idea.
-Okay.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.706
Yeah. Um...

19:33.922 --> 19:35.799
[door opens and closes]

19:35.883 --> 19:36.842
[sighs]

19:38.719 --> 19:41.847
Boys, "soul mate" is just a word.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.349
It's actually two words.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
Words, words.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.645
It's like when you two obsessed
over every little word

19:48.729 --> 19:52.983
in those legal documents I typed up.
I mean, who cares?

19:53.066 --> 19:55.652
I'm sorry, but these words do matter.

19:55.736 --> 19:59.198
Yes, but you just kept going
'round and 'round in circles about it.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.995
Did you ever wonder
why I had those liens on my house?

20:05.078 --> 20:09.333
I'd imagined it had to do
with your menagerie of exotic reptiles.

20:09.416 --> 20:13.253
The truth is,
I had a bit of a gambling problem.

20:13.337 --> 20:17.007
-You did?
-Didn't realize it till I went to therapy.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.052
It wasn't the liens on your house
that made you realize it?

20:20.135 --> 20:23.597
No, Mr. Smarty-Pants.
That's why I needed therapy.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.516
I was stuck in a loop but I didn't see it.

20:26.975 --> 20:31.438
Just like you boys. And I needed somebody
to help me sort it all out.

20:31.521 --> 20:34.650
So you don't have
a gambling problem anymore?

20:34.733 --> 20:35.984
Oh, I do, Sol.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.070
But it's much more manageable.

20:38.153 --> 20:42.991
Thanks to my headshrinker, I only take
the shuttle to the casino once a week.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.745
By the way, do you two play the ponies?
Who do you like?

20:46.828 --> 20:48.914
I would like to go to therapy.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.457
Try getting this one into it.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.126
Our problems are exactly that,
our problems.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.628
And we'll figure them out ourselves.

20:54.711 --> 20:58.173
If you could figure them out yourselves,
you wouldn't be in this pickle.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.633
She's got you there.

20:59.716 --> 21:03.428
You boys used to refuse
to file divorce papers to clients

21:03.512 --> 21:05.389
who hadn't tried
marriage counseling first.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.391
-Nobody's talking divorce.
-Not talking divorce!

21:07.474 --> 21:09.476
All I'm saying is you used to love it

21:09.559 --> 21:11.561
when the couples came back
from counseling

21:11.645 --> 21:14.940
and said they were
giving their marriage another try.

21:17.651 --> 21:21.863
So, do you want to be the couple that
goes to therapy and gets things better,

21:23.699 --> 21:25.492
or the couple that's stuck in a loop?

21:30.580 --> 21:31.498
[coughs]

21:31.873 --> 21:34.001
[Nadia] Thank you so much for this.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.252
It was, um...

21:36.670 --> 21:38.505
So awkward.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.007
So awkward!

21:40.674 --> 21:41.758
Yeah.

21:41.842 --> 21:46.054
Listen, I really appreciate that you've
been so sweet about waiting to...

21:46.638 --> 21:48.265
I just like being around you.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.059
Thank you. Me, too.

21:54.146 --> 21:54.980
Good night.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.583
-I should go.
-Yep.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.501
-Yeah.
-Purse.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.135
-Or I could stay. Okay.
-Yes. Please.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.348
[objects clattering]

22:34.227 --> 22:35.437
[moans]

22:35.812 --> 22:38.648
Let's do this in the back of my car.
There's more room.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.025
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:40.108 --> 22:40.942
Car keys.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.031
-[clanging]
-[Coyote] Ow.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.662
[metal clanking]

22:52.746 --> 22:53.955
What are you doing?

22:54.039 --> 22:57.292
I am putting together this contraption
for your shower.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.586
Oh, God, no. You don't have to do that.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.506
Grace, this isn't completely impossible,
like scrambled eggs.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.133
-There are directions. I can read. See?
-[Grace chuckles]

23:05.592 --> 23:09.930
This piece, obviously, goes right here.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.266
Obviously, this piece does not go here.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.436
We should let Frankie do it.
She's gonna bedazzle it anyway.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.397
I built a billion-dollar company.
I can build a chair.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.357
[yells]

23:22.484 --> 23:24.069
Ah. Oh, fuck!

23:24.152 --> 23:25.445
-Ooh.
-[Grace laughs]

23:25.529 --> 23:28.031
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Are you okay?

23:28.115 --> 23:30.075
-Are you okay?
-No! It hurt like hell.

23:30.158 --> 23:31.368
[sighs]

23:32.869 --> 23:33.870
Jesus...

23:34.830 --> 23:37.707
I suck at this
taking-care-of-people thing.

23:37.791 --> 23:41.128
Yeah, well,
I'm not exactly a pro at it, either.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.463
Maybe that's why
all my marriages imploded.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.925
Wasn't it because you're
a bit of an egomaniac?

23:47.008 --> 23:50.053
Yeah, that probably
had something to do with it.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.557
You know, you might be a disaster
when it comes to taking care of people,

23:53.640 --> 23:56.101
but there is one test you passed
with flying colors.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.185
-I did?
-Mm.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.187
You tried.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.941
And you kept trying,
even when you should have given up.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.651
It was very sweet.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.071
You know what I'd like to do
for you right now?

24:08.572 --> 24:09.990
No. What?

24:11.158 --> 24:13.994
Go to the hospital
and make sure I didn't break my foot.

24:14.077 --> 24:15.078
[chuckles]

24:23.295 --> 24:24.963
What are you doing?

24:25.046 --> 24:26.882
Putting together Grace's chair.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.885
I wasn't sure you'd be here.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.096
Of course I'm here. Where else would I be?

24:33.180 --> 24:36.099
You said you were going to Winnie's house.

24:36.183 --> 24:39.728
No, you said
I was going to Winnie's house.

24:40.103 --> 24:43.607
True. And now that
I've had some time to reflect,

24:43.690 --> 24:46.443
and given myself a good Del-Talking to,

24:46.526 --> 24:49.821
I see that I may have
overreacted a little bit.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.406
Frankie, you don't have to--

24:51.489 --> 24:55.911
No, no, I had no right
to jump to those conclusions.

24:55.994 --> 24:59.456
I trust you and I'm just being jealous.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.750
I appreciate that...

25:02.751 --> 25:03.668
but...

25:04.669 --> 25:07.047
there is... something.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.256
Oh, God.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.008
No, it's not what you think.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.054
But I have been spending
a lot of time with Winnie,

25:14.137 --> 25:17.599
and I've been enjoying it,
but I feel really bad about it.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.477
Well, you don't have to feel bad
about having friends.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.897
No, but it's starting to feel
like it could be a lot more.

25:23.980 --> 25:28.610
All the time I'd be spending with you,
I've been spending with her.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.404
So you want to be with Winnie?

25:31.488 --> 25:35.116
No, I want to be with you.
But you're not there.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.703
Well, there are solutions, Jacob.
This is the 20th century.

25:38.787 --> 25:39.955
Twenty-first century.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.623
Even better.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.668
I can't do this anymore.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.379
Okay, you know what?

25:48.463 --> 25:50.799
I'll put together Grace's thing and, uh...

25:50.924 --> 25:52.842
I have to bedazzle it anyway.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.302
-I meant--
-I know what you meant!

25:54.386 --> 25:57.097
-I don't want to hear it.
-Frankie...

25:58.932 --> 25:59.975
I'm lonely.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.562
-And I miss you.
-Oh...

26:05.272 --> 26:07.941
But I can't put my life on hold
when you're not there,

26:08.024 --> 26:10.360
which is most of the time.

26:10.777 --> 26:13.738
Let's just go to Santa Fe right now.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.909
We'll swing by Del Taco, get my phone,
and then straight to Santa Fe.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.245
But you hate Santa Fe.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.539
But I don't want to break up.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.460
And it sounds like
that's what we're doing.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.546
I think it is.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.341
I think long distance beat us.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.849
[crying]

26:40.932 --> 26:43.560
[Al Green's "How Can You Mend
a Broken Heart?" playing]

26:45.937 --> 26:48.940
Oh, my God!
Where's Jacob? I've got to thank him.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.900
Oh, you can't. He left.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.237
But I thought he wasn't going
until tomorrow night.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.447
He wasn't.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.240
[Grace] Oh...

26:57.324 --> 26:58.199
Ah.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.618
Frankie, what happened?

27:05.081 --> 27:06.041
