05:28.840 --> 05:30.432
Jesus!

05:30.880 --> 05:32.836
"To the city of San Francisco.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.311
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

05:36.560 --> 05:39.472
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.712
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

05:42.960 --> 05:45.838
...at personal column,
<i>San Francisco Chronicle...</i>

05:46.080 --> 05:47.832
...and I will set up meeting.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.638
If I do not hear from you...

05:50.200 --> 05:53.351
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a..."

05:56.320 --> 05:57.150
"Scorpio."

06:00.360 --> 06:01.873
What goes on in their minds?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.314
Kooks.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.314
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

06:07.560 --> 06:10.870
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

06:11.800 --> 06:15.793
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.796
Instead, we pay a police department.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.071
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.997
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.275
Send Inspector Callahan in.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.669
Callahan?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.111
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.429
All right.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.795
Let's have it.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.157
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

06:46.360 --> 06:47.952
For the past 3/4 hour...

06:48.200 --> 06:50.998
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.953
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.517
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

07:10.360 --> 07:12.271
There's a madman loose.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.637
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.673
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.356
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

07:25.600 --> 07:26.749
...rifle nuts, peepers...

07:27.000 --> 07:28.513
Mr. Mayor?

07:28.920 --> 07:31.673
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

07:31.880 --> 07:35.350
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

07:35.560 --> 07:37.073
...and in the black area.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.515
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.079
We're sure it's a 30-06.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.073
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

07:44.440 --> 07:45.873
We're running a computer check...

07:46.120 --> 07:49.795
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

07:50.040 --> 07:51.519
...October 23 and November 21.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.715
Why?

07:53.520 --> 07:54.669
Natives of Scorpio.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.754
Thank you, inspector.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.190
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.079
How about you?

08:05.480 --> 08:06.469
Nobody.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.477
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?

08:08.680 --> 08:09.908
Nobody.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.951
All right. Give the message
to the <i>Chronicle.</i>

08:16.440 --> 08:19.352
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.477
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

08:21.840 --> 08:23.398
You'll play this creep's game?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.358
It'll give us breathing space.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.557
It might get somebody killed.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.238
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

08:30.480 --> 08:33.995
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.919
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.913
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.875
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.033
That's my policy.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.431
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

08:55.680 --> 08:59.798
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.593
Intent?

09:01.840 --> 09:03.432
How did you establish that?

09:05.080 --> 09:09.835
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

09:10.080 --> 09:13.390
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.876
I think he's got a point.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.392
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.076
Usual.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.196
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

10:19.400 --> 10:20.879
What difference does it make?

10:21.760 --> 10:23.034
Not much.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.833
Hey, Jaffe...

10:28.200 --> 10:30.668
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.868
Tan Ford?

10:37.800 --> 10:38.789
Yeah, tan Ford.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.752
Engine running?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.679
I don't know.
How can I tell?

10:44.160 --> 10:47.311
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

10:47.840 --> 10:49.478
Look at that pollution.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.277
Do me a favor, will you?

10:57.160 --> 10:59.196
Call this telephone number.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.109
Police Department?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.999
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

11:04.240 --> 11:07.437
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

11:09.320 --> 11:10.116
Got it.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.477
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

11:13.880 --> 11:16.394
In progress.
Yes, sir.

11:20.320 --> 11:25.189
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.239
Shit!

11:42.680 --> 11:43.635
Halt!

13:05.240 --> 13:06.912
I know what you're thinking.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.358
Did he fire six shots or only five?

13:10.920 --> 13:14.549
To tell the truth, in the excitement
I kind of lost track myself.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.917
This is a.44 Magnum, the most
powerful handgun in the world...

13:18.160 --> 13:20.355
...and would blow
your head clean off...

13:20.600 --> 13:24.673
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

13:24.920 --> 13:26.478
Well, do you, punk?

13:47.640 --> 13:49.471
I got to know.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.634
Son of a bitch!

14:12.440 --> 14:14.795
It looks like we can save that leg.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.871
I've got a couple under my knee.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.792
Ever consider
another line of work?

14:19.520 --> 14:21.351
I really appreciate this, Steve.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.949
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.752
Nothing fancy, now.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.436
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.558
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.918
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.636
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

14:41.520 --> 14:42.873
Sorry, Harry.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.709
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.079
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.709
For $29.50, let it hurt.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.394
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.035
- Good morning, inspector.
- Maria.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.035
You wanted to see me, lieutenant?

16:27.760 --> 16:30.115
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

16:30.360 --> 16:32.157
Whenever you do.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.313
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
Checking the search patterns.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.711
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.076
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.312
- He was?
- He said to say, "Well done!"

16:45.560 --> 16:47.471
I can't tell you how moved I am.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.676
I pass along a compliment...

16:49.920 --> 16:53.629
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.757
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.118
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.193
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

17:03.440 --> 17:04.873
I'm putting somebody
with you.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.273
- What are you talking about?
- You need a partner.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.912
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

17:17.400 --> 17:20.597
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.359
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.636
I have no time to break in newcomers.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.952
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

17:29.480 --> 17:33.234
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

17:33.440 --> 17:34.714
...and Fanduchi's dead.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.154
So?

17:37.520 --> 17:40.751
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.149
What about De Georgio?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.628
No way!

17:43.880 --> 17:45.950
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.156
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.149
I got it.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.030
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

18:00.600 --> 18:01.919
You from around here?

18:02.160 --> 18:04.196
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.750
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.798
Just what I need is a college boy.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.794
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.156
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.790
Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.149
I intend to.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.476
Inspector Callahan.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.269
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.748
I'll remember that.

18:31.120 --> 18:34.749
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.749
You're a sweet man, Harry.

18:42.440 --> 18:45.034
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.351
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

18:47.600 --> 18:49.318
That's one thing about our Harry.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.754
Doesn't play favorites.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.357
Harry hates everybody: Limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.069
You name it.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.108
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

19:01.920 --> 19:03.717
Especially spics.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.479
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

21:51.680 --> 21:53.557
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

22:16.880 --> 22:17.995
<i>You, on the roof!</i>

22:18.720 --> 22:19.948
<i>You, there!</i>

22:20.160 --> 22:21.832
<i>Yes, you.</i>
<i>Stop what you're doing.</i>

22:22.080 --> 22:24.719
<i>Turn around</i>
<i>and put your hands in the air.</i>

22:42.040 --> 22:44.429
<i>I don 't know</i>
<i>how the helicopter boys lost him!</i>

22:44.800 --> 22:47.553
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

22:47.800 --> 22:51.429
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.238
That's possible.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.518
<i>- Attention, all units.</i>
- Turn that thing up louder.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.276
<i>Prowler last seen</i>
<i>in the vicinity of Washington Square.</i>

23:08.520 --> 23:09.589
<i>He is an adult male.</i>

23:09.840 --> 23:13.355
<i>Caucasian. Repeat,</i>
<i>adult male Caucasian.</i>

23:13.600 --> 23:15.795
<i>When last seen,</i>
<i>he was wearing tan chinos...</i>

23:16.000 --> 23:19.709
<i>... pale blue shirt, brown coat</i>
<i>or sweater, dark gloves.</i>

23:19.960 --> 23:21.234
<i>He had a tan suitcase...</i>

23:21.480 --> 23:25.553
<i>... which probably contains a</i>
<i>30-06 rifle. He's wanted...</i>

23:25.800 --> 23:29.076
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

23:29.640 --> 23:31.119
I know what you mean.

23:34.440 --> 23:35.953
- There!
- What?

23:36.160 --> 23:37.798
Tan suitcase.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.355
- Where?
- I lost him.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.879
There he goes, over there.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.394
Does that bag look tan?

23:45.600 --> 23:47.795
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.672
Go to Filbert and hang a left.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.433
Look out for these people!

23:51.680 --> 23:54.672
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

23:58.520 --> 24:01.876
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.191
I saw him.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.998
- There he is.
- I see him.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.438
<i>Car 2, the license number...</i>

24:11.680 --> 24:14.399
<i>... at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,</i>
<i>Colorado plates.</i>

24:19.600 --> 24:23.275
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go here.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.313
<i>Car 2, what's the model</i>
<i>of that Chevrolet?</i>

24:29.160 --> 24:31.799
<i>Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.</i>

24:32.440 --> 24:33.589
<i>10-4.</i>

24:45.120 --> 24:48.192
<i>You can cancel that 10-25.</i>
<i>Three cars here.</i>

25:10.240 --> 25:11.878
Anybody home?

25:35.880 --> 25:38.030
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

25:53.640 --> 25:57.633
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

26:02.920 --> 26:04.399
You getting an eyeful?

26:04.640 --> 26:06.756
You goddamn pie hawker!

26:07.000 --> 26:09.275
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

26:17.600 --> 26:19.511
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.070
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

26:26.280 --> 26:28.874
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.152
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

26:32.360 --> 26:34.237
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

26:34.440 --> 26:35.839
Beat it. Get out of here.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.392
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.437
I just had another thought.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.079
Yeah? About what?

26:48.320 --> 26:50.675
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.872
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

27:01.480 --> 27:04.313
<i>Inspector 71.</i>
<i>Please respond to your call.</i>

27:05.320 --> 27:07.595
<i>Inspector 71.</i>
<i>Do you read me?</i>

27:08.120 --> 27:11.556
- This is Inspector 71.
<i>- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.</i>

27:11.800 --> 27:14.360
<i>California Hall</i>
<i>at Polk and Turk streets.</i>

27:14.600 --> 27:16.318
10-4. We're on our way.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.748
It's some idiot.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.997
Where? I don't see him.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.839
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.275
<i>I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.</i>

27:48.520 --> 27:51.637
<i>In 600 block of Baker.</i>
<i>On a Chevrolet.</i>

27:51.880 --> 27:56.476
<i>California license D-dog,</i>
<i>C- Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.</i>

28:04.520 --> 28:08.593
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

28:21.560 --> 28:25.712
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here...

28:25.960 --> 28:28.633
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.911
Don't you try to get me!

29:41.160 --> 29:44.630
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.756
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

29:49.000 --> 29:53.790
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

29:54.520 --> 29:55.953
Won't you try to grab me?

29:57.320 --> 30:01.836
A friend of mine was up about 20
floors with a jumper a few years ago.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.190
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.429
Mashed all over.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.719
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which...

30:09.920 --> 30:13.117
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.797
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

30:17.480 --> 30:21.109
It's a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.396
Even if they find
your driver's license!

30:23.640 --> 30:24.959
All that blood!

30:28.320 --> 30:30.595
I think I'm going to puke!

30:30.880 --> 30:34.350
Don't do that, son. All those people
down there looking up.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.393
The fire chief looking up.
With his face...

30:38.040 --> 30:39.189
You bastard!

31:24.320 --> 31:26.629
Get the stretcher up here.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.080
Now you know why I'm called
Dirty Harry.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.635
Every dirty job that comes along.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.879
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

31:59.600 --> 32:01.272
This is Inspector 71.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.877
<i>Got something for you. Corner of</i>
<i>Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.</i>

32:08.240 --> 32:09.150
What about him?

32:09.440 --> 32:12.034
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.837
Anybody know who the boy is?

32:16.080 --> 32:18.116
His name was Charlie Russell.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.913
I'm his mother.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.512
He's only 10 years old.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.360
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

32:39.600 --> 32:41.670
You'd better go check on the mother.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.749
What do you have?

32:55.800 --> 32:57.916
<i>That 30-06 shell casing.</i>

32:58.160 --> 32:59.878
<i>He was up here all right.</i>

33:04.360 --> 33:05.873
Welcome to Homicide.

33:24.440 --> 33:28.433
The man who designed blue serge
uniforms for police departments...

33:28.840 --> 33:30.831
...has to sell these for a living!

33:35.280 --> 33:37.430
.458 Magnum?

33:39.360 --> 33:42.238
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.954
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.237
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.038
What have you got, lieutenant?

33:52.280 --> 33:56.478
The blue flags represent the units that
will be on duty by dark tonight.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.870
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.793
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.953
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.634
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.472
We're saving that for him.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.194
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

34:13.440 --> 34:17.353
It's a building that overlooks the
roof where they spotted him yesterday.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.518
Something bothering you?

34:20.320 --> 34:23.471
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.672
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.956
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

34:30.159 --> 34:33.550
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.511
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.435
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.069
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.550
Scorpio strikes again.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.071
They like that feeling.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.755
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.911
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.196
And they're having a novena tonight.

34:58.440 --> 34:59.953
Go on.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.358
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.158
The Russell boy was black.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.995
He may just figure
he owes himself a <i>padre.</i>

35:23.720 --> 35:25.551
Inspector 71.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.075
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.149
How about the priest?

35:53.360 --> 35:56.557
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.633
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.269
Who?

36:04.040 --> 36:05.109
Never guess.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.632
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

37:36.040 --> 37:39.396
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.315
Son of a bitch took the bait!

37:56.440 --> 37:59.432
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.556
Now!

39:19.800 --> 39:21.631
- You all right?
- I think so.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.713
Call an ambulance.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.877
Collins never knew what hit him.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.198
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.595
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.876
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

41:16.760 --> 41:19.149
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

41:20.760 --> 41:21.875
Ann Mary Deacon.

41:22.120 --> 41:25.590
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

41:25.840 --> 41:30.277
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.238
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive."

41:32.480 --> 41:35.756
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.712
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

41:39.960 --> 41:43.509
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.479
One man with yellow bag.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.439
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.033
9 p.m.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.356
She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. Tomorrow.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.114
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

41:55.320 --> 41:58.995
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

41:59.200 --> 42:01.714
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio."

42:04.160 --> 42:05.115
Anything else?

42:06.800 --> 42:09.030
The mother identified the bra...

42:09.280 --> 42:10.838
...the hank of hair...

42:11.200 --> 42:12.315
...and that.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.118
The dentist identified that.

42:16.040 --> 42:18.349
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.429
You know she's dead.

42:21.680 --> 42:25.878
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

42:27.040 --> 42:30.430
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.793
He's using up a lot of favors.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.393
He wants to pay.

42:38.040 --> 42:39.519
No tricks.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.237
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

42:49.360 --> 42:50.236
You got it.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.438
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- All right.

42:53.680 --> 42:56.194
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.112
No cover?
Not even one man?

43:00.360 --> 43:01.713
Sure that's how to do it?

43:01.920 --> 43:04.753
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

43:06.720 --> 43:10.872
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.793
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.598
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

43:18.520 --> 43:20.590
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.590
Testing 1, 2, 3...

43:33.840 --> 43:37.071
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.159
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow."

43:40.360 --> 43:41.918
Okay, that's better.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.953
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

43:45.160 --> 43:46.513
...forget it.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.836
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?

43:49.080 --> 43:51.150
Bring it back in one piece.

43:55.160 --> 43:56.832
$200,000.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.991
Count it and sign for it.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.357
Did you count it out?

44:05.760 --> 44:07.512
Did you count it, chief?

44:09.160 --> 44:11.355
It's not my responsibility.

44:13.440 --> 44:16.796
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.590
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

44:25.600 --> 44:29.388
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.915
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

44:32.200 --> 44:35.158
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

44:43.840 --> 44:46.035
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

44:46.280 --> 44:49.431
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

44:52.200 --> 44:54.953
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

45:05.200 --> 45:08.875
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

46:10.840 --> 46:14.435
<i>- You got a yellow suitcase?</i>
- Yeah, I got it right with me.

46:17.640 --> 46:19.790
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- Callahan.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.554
<i>- What are you?</i>
- Police officer.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.393
Hello?

46:35.680 --> 46:37.591
<i>All right, police officer...</i>

46:37.840 --> 46:39.592
<i>... this is how we play.</i>

46:40.720 --> 46:43.837
<i>I bounce you all over town</i>
<i>to make sure you're alone.</i>

46:44.360 --> 46:47.318
<i>If I even think you're being followed,</i>
<i>the girl dies.</i>

46:47.560 --> 46:51.519
<i>If you talk to anyone, even if it's</i>
<i>a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...</i>

46:51.840 --> 46:53.193
<i>... the girl dies.</i>

46:53.440 --> 46:56.398
- Is the girl okay?
<i>- Just shut up and listen.</i>

46:56.680 --> 46:57.908
<i>No car.</i>

46:58.400 --> 47:01.915
<i>I give you some time</i>
<i>to go from phone booth to phone booth.</i>

47:02.120 --> 47:05.590
<i>I ring 4 times.</i>
<i>You don 't answer by the fourth ring...</i>

47:05.840 --> 47:07.751
<i>... that's the end of the game.</i>

47:08.240 --> 47:09.719
<i>The girl dies.</i>

47:09.960 --> 47:11.757
<i>What time you got?</i>

47:12.720 --> 47:15.871
- 9:30. Now listen...
<i>- You listen.</i>

47:16.560 --> 47:18.073
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

47:18.680 --> 47:22.150
<i>Not all the time,</i>
<i>but you'll never know when or where.</i>

47:23.200 --> 47:27.398
<i>Now get to Forest Hills Station</i>
<i>as fast as you can. Understand?</i>

47:33.000 --> 47:35.833
- Yeah.
<i>- I hope you're not stupid.</i>

48:15.600 --> 48:16.999
<i>Downstairs.</i>
<i>Take the "K" car.</i>

48:17.240 --> 48:20.835
<i>Get off at Church and 20th.</i>
<i>Hurry up, or you'll blow it.</i>

50:21.480 --> 50:23.277
<i>You sound like you had a good rest.</i>

50:23.520 --> 50:27.149
<i>You'll need it. I'm going to give you</i>
<i>a nice little run this time.</i>

50:27.360 --> 50:30.636
<i>You better make it,</i>
<i>because if you don 't, dead girl!</i>

50:30.880 --> 50:33.952
<i>Public phone,</i>
<i>hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.</i>

50:36.080 --> 50:39.072
<i>Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.</i>

51:11.400 --> 51:13.152
What's in the bag, man?

51:14.280 --> 51:17.431
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

51:17.680 --> 51:18.999
Just give us the wallet.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.272
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

51:51.000 --> 51:52.877
Don't answer that!

52:01.640 --> 52:05.918
<i>- Who picked it up?</i>
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.

52:10.400 --> 52:12.197
<i>Chico, he hung up.</i>

52:14.600 --> 52:16.795
<i>- You know Mt. Davidson Park?</i>
- Yeah.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.234
<i>Go to the cross.</i>

52:55.760 --> 52:57.955
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.876
<i>I'm going up.</i>

53:14.680 --> 53:16.636
I see a couple of people.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.632
Just a couple of kids necking.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.189
Boys or girls?

53:42.000 --> 53:44.116
I'm Callahan.

53:46.240 --> 53:47.992
My friends call me Alice.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.959
And I will take a dare.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.953
When was the last time
you were busted?

53:54.440 --> 53:57.398
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

53:57.880 --> 53:59.199
Well, do it at home.

55:00.240 --> 55:01.275
Freeze!

55:02.280 --> 55:04.032
Just like a statue.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.393
That's right.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.913
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

55:10.160 --> 55:12.720
I'll kill you and the girl both.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.679
Understand?

55:16.160 --> 55:17.275
Yeah.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.035
Drop the bag.

55:23.520 --> 55:24.794
Left hand.

55:25.320 --> 55:26.878
Let's see the gun.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.355
My!

55:33.800 --> 55:35.392
That's a big one.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.717
Left hand. Throw it.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.154
Easy.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.634
Raise your hands.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.552
Come on, get them up.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.389
Now turn.

55:53.640 --> 55:55.358
Face the cross.

55:57.840 --> 55:58.909
Come on.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.833
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

56:22.880 --> 56:26.873
You lift that hand once more and I
won't let you know where the girl is!

56:27.200 --> 56:29.031
Do we understand each other?

56:29.960 --> 56:31.234
Do we understand each other?

56:32.520 --> 56:34.511
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.318
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

56:36.560 --> 56:38.630
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

56:39.720 --> 56:42.075
Do we understand each other?

56:42.840 --> 56:47.277
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

56:47.520 --> 56:48.669
Listen to me carefully.

56:49.720 --> 56:51.358
I've changed my mind.

56:51.920 --> 56:53.512
I'm going to let her die.

56:55.400 --> 56:57.550
I just wanted you to know that.

57:01.760 --> 57:06.151
<i>You understand? I just wanted to make</i>
<i>sure you knew that before I killed you.</i>

57:15.160 --> 57:16.639
Goodbye, Callahan!

57:25.680 --> 57:27.398
Chico, don't kill him!

59:17.720 --> 59:20.951
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, chief.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.470
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.274
He's right here.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.033
He's got two cracked ribs.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.953
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

59:30.200 --> 59:33.237
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

59:33.480 --> 59:34.674
I'm sending him home.

59:34.920 --> 59:36.194
Right, chief.

59:37.280 --> 59:38.952
He says beat it! That's an order.

59:41.040 --> 59:44.430
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

59:44.680 --> 59:48.150
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

59:48.400 --> 59:50.470
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

59:50.720 --> 59:53.234
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

59:53.480 --> 59:55.118
What am I going to tell him?

59:57.560 --> 59:59.790
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.472
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.240
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.790
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.354
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.151
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.876
- Put him on.
- What is it?

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.514
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.078
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.352
Long blond hair...

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.433
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.189
Pale complexion.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.876
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.598
They usually give a phony name.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.911
But I've seen him someplace.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.399
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.551
I'm trying to think!

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.119
It was...

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.518
I believe he works around here.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.678
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.512
Yes, just a moment.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.999
She'll be dead in an hour!

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.196
I'm trying to remember!

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.311
I've got who he is.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.193
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.394
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.200
- Live where?
- There.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.558
Kezar Stadium.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.436
Illegal entry. No warrant.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.432
Looks like we climb.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.193
Too much linguine.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.958
I'll find another way.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.989
Stop!

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.192
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.635
You need any help?

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.999
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.790
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.390
Let me have a doctor!

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.074
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.113
The girl, where is she?

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.475
You tried to kill me!

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.713
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.075
I want a lawyer.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.111
I said, where's the girl?

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.477
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.830
I have the right to a lawyer!

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.159
Don't! Please!

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.834
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.550
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.634
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.992
- It's Inspector Callahan.
<i>- Have him come in, please.</i>

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.116
Won't you come this way?

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.796
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.837
I'll be done in a minute.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.879
Have a seat.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.475
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.231
A very unusual piece of police work.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.148
Really amazing.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.554
I had some luck.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.429
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.879
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.908
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.234
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.758
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.872
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.953
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.390
You should be.
I've got news for you.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.194
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.913
What are you talking about?

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.275
He's free!

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.399
You're letting him go?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.358
We have to.
We can't try him.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.794
And why is that?

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.918
Because I'm not wasting
1/2 million tax dollars...

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.310
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.194
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.193
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.789
Zero.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.789
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.918
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.073
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.588
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.955
It's the law.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.079
Then the law is crazy!

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.918
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.796
He holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.075
Your Honor?

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.950
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.199
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.231
...is inadmissible in court.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.268
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.631
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.798
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.155
But I didn't know that!

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.350
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.633
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.756
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.194
...physical evidence...

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.630
...would have to be excluded.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.271
There must be something
you can get him on!

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.358
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.759
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.709
Now, the suspect's rights...

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.678
...were violated...

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.990
...under the 4th and 5th...

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.913
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.594
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.798
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.519
The district attorney's office!

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.118
If you'll let us.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.633
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.632
He won't be out there long.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.950
What is that supposed to mean?

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.278
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.074
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.793
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.593
How do you know?

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.512
Because he likes it.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.672
You sure you weren't tailed?

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.349
Yeah.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.190
You really want $200 worth.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.071
Every penny of it.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.199
Might as well be comfortable.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.438
Go on, sit.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.273
Relax.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.317
Take it easy.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.910
It's going to be all right.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.710
You sure you want the rest of it?

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.112
Every penny's worth!

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.910
You black son of a bitch!

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:12.075
This one's on the house.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.593
That's got to be him.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.039
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.111
I swear it. As God is my judge.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.396
Why are they harassing you?

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.551
They tried to frame me with the murder.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.553
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.793
I'm innocent until proven guilty
and look at what they did to me.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.117
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.513
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.676
Did you see who did this to you?

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.035
Can you identify him?

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.711
<i>His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.</i>
<i>Works Homicide. Callahan.</i>

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.072
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.153
Since then he's given
a statement to <i>The Chronicle.</i>

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.791
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.438
What about it, Harry?

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.709
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.632
Have you been following him?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.556
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.110
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.438
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.760
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.594
I don't want any more surveillance!

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.192
Neither does he.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.115
What does that mean?

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.398
Good night, sir.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.792
Go ahead. Try them.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.756
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.560
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.080
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.678
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.712
Doing a lot of thinking
about it and...

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.791
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.391
...what for? You know?

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.438
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.270
See you tomorrow. Same time?

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.839
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.715
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.393
No class.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.236
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.277
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.355
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.556
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.234
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.710
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:25.509
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.954
And I think...

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.435
...what if it's the last time
I see him?

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.072
Am I the only one?

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.237
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.589
No.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.750
You mean she got used to it?

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.958
No, she never did, really.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.428
What, then?

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.599
She's dead.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.992
Please, forgive me.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.712
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.359
No reason for it, really.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.350
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.672
I want you to tell Chico...

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.636
...that I understand him quitting.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.917
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.557
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.473
I really don't.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.390
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.631
What the hell happened to you?

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.757
My wife's brother.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.069
I hit her...

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.912
...so he hit me.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.593
Several times.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.479
$5.69.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.358
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.955
14 times the last 3 years.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.078
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.788
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.555
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.149
Please, I scare easy.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.874
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.995
Goodbye.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.958
See you tomorrow.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.074
Everybody out who gets out here?

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.913
School bus inspector.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.634
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.398
I'm authorizing it, so go.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.398
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:32.758
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.230
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.279
Let's have some fun now.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.993
Who knows a song?

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.118
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.312
Come on, sing for us.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.194
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.788
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:44.999
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.753
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.158
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.517
Tell them the man is dangerous.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.389
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.073
"To the City of San Francisco.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.714
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.476
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:12.795
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.508
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.035
...exactly what I say. Scorpio."

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.871
Better have somebody standing by!

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.951
I don't think it's a false alarm.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.310
<i>There's a call for you on line 2.</i>

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.875
<i>I think it's the one</i>
<i>you've been waiting for.</i>

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.993
- It's the Mayor.
<i>- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.</i>

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.549
I got the bus and...

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.156
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.152
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.873
Just tell him.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.719
Not my fault, he had a gun...

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:52.796
Just your name!

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.079
<i>This is Marcella Platt.</i>

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.314
<i>You can check if you want.</i>
<i>But I don 't see any point.</i>

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.039
<i>I'm not bullshitting.</i>

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:07.232
<i>It's simple. I got the kids.</i>
<i>You start screwing around...</i>

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:08.953
<i>... the kids start dying.</i>

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.630
- The plane ready?
<i>- It's being fueled, and ready to go.</i>

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.513
<i>The money will be there</i>
<i>by the time you get there.</i>

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.757
<i>Listen carefully.</i>
<i>I will drive along nice and easy.</i>

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.877
<i>Just me and a busload of kids.</i>

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.272
<i>I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake</i>
<i>on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.</i>

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.272
<i>I don 't want any police cars...</i>

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.595
<i>... helicopters, whatever.</i>

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.873
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.798
Where are you going?

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.437
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.317
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.073
I give you my word of honor.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.191
Marcella Platt. It checks.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.390
Willing to take the money to him?

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.753
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.913
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.353
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.152
And that's a direct order!

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.351
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.992
Where are we going?

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.509
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.551
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.274
I want to go home to my mother.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.635
Go home to your what?

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.158
Now, sing! Sing again!

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.878
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.636
Are you sick?
What is it?

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.908
Sing or your mothers will die!

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.754
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.631
Get in the right-hand lane.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.155
Not right to treat children that way.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.755
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.991
And get in the right-hand lane!

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.636
I want my mother.

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.232
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.475
Make a right there.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:49.397
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.837
Not this one.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.759
I want my mother.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:55.989
Shut up!

01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.473
Just get to the right!

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.313
Jesus!

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.548
What the hell is he doing up there?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.958
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.793
Drop the gun, creep!

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.511
I'll blow his brains out.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.478
Drop the fucking gun!

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.638
I know what you're thinking.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.196
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:51.317
To tell you the truth, I forgot
myself, in all this excitement.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.875
But being this is a.44 Magnum, the
most powerful handgun in the world...

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.674
...and will blow your head
clean off...

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.791
...you've got to ask yourself:

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.758
"Do I feel lucky?"

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.550
Well, do you, punk?
