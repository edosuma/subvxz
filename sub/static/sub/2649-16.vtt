WEBVTT

00:04.089 --> 00:06.884
Ooh! Individual frittatas.
What a treat.

00:07.009 --> 00:08.969
You're a lucky man, Phil.
I'm always saying, I'm-

00:09.094 --> 00:10.554
Phil. Sorry.

00:10.637 --> 00:12.139
You left the milk
out again.

00:12.222 --> 00:14.183
Mmm. I may have to take
one of these little guys home.

00:14.266 --> 00:15.976
Claire, did you ever find
that Tupperware I lent you?

00:16.059 --> 00:19.730
Sweetie, for the hundredth time,
I gave it back to you. Remember?

00:19.813 --> 00:23.567
I remember you telling me a hundred
times, yet my pea soup is in Baggies.

00:23.692 --> 00:26.153
Did you check your car,
in the, um- Trunk.

00:26.236 --> 00:27.946
Because that's where
you found that thing...

00:28.030 --> 00:29.781
that you thought that you
gave me long time ago.

00:29.907 --> 00:31.533
The-The-
Pizza cutter.

00:31.617 --> 00:33.869
- Good. Give me another one.
- Yes, I was wrong that time.

00:33.952 --> 00:36.371
It's a piece of plastic.
You're ruining brunch.

00:36.455 --> 00:38.582
Don't sweat it, Cam.
I forget things all the time.

00:38.665 --> 00:40.709
Like I can never
remember the name...

00:40.792 --> 00:42.669
of that weather guy
that I liked.

00:42.753 --> 00:45.047
Uh, Thunder-something.
Stormy-

00:45.130 --> 00:47.090
Flash Storm? Ah!
Whatever the hell it is.

00:47.216 --> 00:49.509
I don't know.
Just eat your eggs, Jay.

00:49.593 --> 00:51.303
Yeah. Just eat
your eggs, Jay.

00:51.386 --> 00:53.722
Ay! Qué linda!

00:53.805 --> 00:56.141
Grandpa got told!

00:56.225 --> 00:59.645
Look at them.
They all think Lily's so great.

00:59.728 --> 01:00.938
The novelty will wear off.

01:01.021 --> 01:02.689
We used to be
the cute ones.

01:02.773 --> 01:04.399
Now she gets
all the attention.

01:04.483 --> 01:06.401
We need to take her down.

01:06.485 --> 01:07.986
I should remember
his name, too,

01:08.070 --> 01:10.447
because your mom and I
got in a big fight over him.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.824
She was using the convertible,
and I told her,

01:12.908 --> 01:15.661
"Put the top up because it's
supposed to rain tonight...

01:15.744 --> 01:17.704
according to"-

01:17.788 --> 01:20.749
P-P-P- Partly McCloudy-
whatever the hell his name is.

01:20.832 --> 01:23.126
Anyway, she didn't.
Ruined the car.

01:23.210 --> 01:26.088
Well, not to be the one that
always comes to Mom's defense-

01:26.171 --> 01:27.965
What? It was 20 years ago.

01:28.048 --> 01:29.758
What, you think
he's gonna ground you?

01:29.841 --> 01:31.593
- It was you?
- Yes.

01:31.677 --> 01:34.763
Yes, I left the top down,
and I let Mom take the fall.

01:34.846 --> 01:36.932
- And then they got divorced.
- Twelve years later.

01:37.015 --> 01:38.725
- I'm just saying.
- Oh! You're ruining brunch.

01:38.809 --> 01:42.062
Relax. It was years ago. There's a
statute of limitation on this stuff.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.855
In that case, I should
probably let you know...

01:43.939 --> 01:46.608
I let the top down to let out
the cigarette smoke.

01:48.819 --> 01:50.487
Not mine. Not mine.
My bad friend- Eleanor.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.197
"Eleanor" being
her boyfriend, Allan.

01:52.322 --> 01:55.033
Statute of limitations.  Relax.
it's okay.

01:55.117 --> 01:58.704
Remember when I told you that I couldn't
get to your figure skating semifinal...

01:58.787 --> 02:00.414
- because I was stuck at work?
- Yeah.

02:00.497 --> 02:02.207
Well, by "stuck,"
I meant drunk.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.001
And by "work,"
I meant the golf course.

02:04.084 --> 02:05.585
Jay!

02:05.669 --> 02:07.879
- Oh, Dad.
- Oh, no. I got one. I got one.

02:07.963 --> 02:09.631
Remember that time we
went golfing together,

02:09.756 --> 02:11.466
and you got a hole in one? Yeah?

02:11.550 --> 02:13.135
You never got
a hole in one.

02:13.218 --> 02:15.304
I got bored,
and I kicked it in the hole.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.724
This is fun.
Here's a corker.

02:18.807 --> 02:21.351
They didn't used to label babies
as carefully in hospitals.

02:21.435 --> 02:23.103
- So for two days-
- Not now, Phil!

02:23.186 --> 02:24.938
What do you mean,
you kicked the ball in the hole?

02:25.063 --> 02:28.567
What, was it on the edge? Yeah. It was on
the edge of that, uh- that sandy thing.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.986
Gee, it's sure gonna be fun
to face my friends today.

02:31.111 --> 02:33.947
You don't have to tell them.
They call me Ace, Mitch.

02:34.031 --> 02:36.616
I haven't paid for lemonade
down there in 20 years.

02:36.742 --> 02:38.785
You're mad at me?  Mmm.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.289
Great, Daddy.
You ruined brunch.

02:42.414 --> 02:44.291
Ay! Qué linda!

02:44.374 --> 02:45.917
You did.

02:46.001 --> 02:47.836
This ends today.

02:47.919 --> 02:49.671
Is that what
you're calling them?

02:50.589 --> 02:52.507
# Hey, hey #

02:52.591 --> 02:54.426
# Hey, hey #

02:54.509 --> 02:56.595
# Hey, hey #

02:56.678 --> 02:58.513
# Hey, hey #

02:58.597 --> 02:59.765
# Hey ##

03:02.267 --> 03:04.019
A little help here.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.562
You can't expect me to focus...

03:05.645 --> 03:07.189
when Miranda Cornell lives
right down your street.

03:07.272 --> 03:08.982
She's like a dream
wrapped in a wish...

03:09.066 --> 03:10.776
poured into jeggings.

03:10.859 --> 03:13.862
Yeah, yeah. That's nice and all,
but we got a trap to set.

03:13.945 --> 03:15.530
Are you sure
this is going to work?

03:15.614 --> 03:18.283
Trust me. We'll use
these cookies as bait.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.035
Lily's crazy for them.

03:20.118 --> 03:21.620
Asian metabolism.

03:21.703 --> 03:23.705
When she grabs one with
her grubby little hands,

03:23.789 --> 03:25.415
off goes the trap.

03:25.499 --> 03:28.794
Boom- big puddle of milk.
She'll get in so much trouble.

03:28.877 --> 03:30.587
My mom hates messes.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.547
I'm familiar with Claire.

03:32.631 --> 03:35.550
Lock ... and loaded.

03:36.468 --> 03:39.429
Mmm! These cookies
are so good...

03:39.513 --> 03:42.099
and so easy to reach.

03:42.182 --> 03:43.725
Lily!

03:50.524 --> 03:53.235
Oh!

03:56.238 --> 03:58.448
Oh, my God! Cam!

03:58.532 --> 04:00.200
What happened?
Are you okay?

04:00.283 --> 04:03.912
That milk fell, and
I must have slipped in it.

04:03.995 --> 04:06.331
Did I leave that out again?
I'm so sorry!

04:06.415 --> 04:07.999
Oh, my back.
Oh, my back.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.836
Can I give you a Swedish
massage, accent optional?

04:10.919 --> 04:13.171
Oh. Oh, no. I just
need to lie down.

04:13.255 --> 04:15.298
Come on. Let's get you
over to the sofa.

04:15.382 --> 04:17.591
Oh! Do you think it
would be offensive...

04:17.676 --> 04:19.428
if I ask our daughter
to walk on my back?

04:19.511 --> 04:22.597
I'd say so. I just offered
to give you a massage.

04:22.681 --> 04:25.392
Oh, no! You broke Beatrice.

04:25.475 --> 04:27.853
Now she can't
feed the dolphins.

04:27.978 --> 04:30.522
What is she talking about? Oh.
it's a My Sweet Companion doll.

04:30.605 --> 04:32.441
They all have these
elaborate backstories.

04:32.524 --> 04:34.776
Beatrice works with
blind dolphins and models.

04:34.860 --> 04:37.362
There are blind models?

04:37.446 --> 04:41.032
That's so sad. They cannot see
how pretty they are.

04:43.243 --> 04:45.787
Okay. Hold on. Give me some. Give me some.
Give me some.

04:45.912 --> 04:47.414
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh!

04:47.497 --> 04:49.624
Let me buy Lily
a new doll.

04:49.749 --> 04:51.960
It's my fault Cam fell.
No, no need.

04:52.043 --> 04:55.505
The My Sweet Companion store actually
has a hospital with an on-call doctor.

04:55.589 --> 04:57.799
I can go. I'm taking the
girls to the mall anyway.

04:57.883 --> 05:00.302
Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. And don't worry.
She has medical insurance.

05:00.385 --> 05:02.429
And I think we've met our
deductible for the year.

05:02.554 --> 05:04.473
- So you should be good.
- Yeah.

05:04.556 --> 05:06.183
Do you know what a doll
is in my village?

05:06.266 --> 05:08.059
An apple on a fork.

05:10.729 --> 05:14.441
I never really got dolls.
Does that make me weird?

05:14.566 --> 05:16.276
it's on the list.
You're not weird.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.403
You just kind of skipped
the "little girl" stage.

05:18.487 --> 05:21.239
And jumped to the "I dare you
to ring her doorbell" stage.

05:21.323 --> 05:23.783
The only stage you're ever going
to jump on has a pole on it.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.619
Hey, at least I have
the body- Oh, please!

05:25.702 --> 05:30.499
Okay, okay! We're gonna have to settle
this dispute in court- the food court.

05:30.582 --> 05:33.168
The Honorable Judge
Cinnabon presiding.

05:33.251 --> 05:36.546
The food court? That place smells like
the inside of Luke's bicycle helmet.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.673
I like the food court. Me too.

05:38.757 --> 05:40.675
Don't worry, girls. We're not
gonna deprive ourselves...

05:40.759 --> 05:42.260
just 'cause
Haley's aversion-

05:44.846 --> 05:47.474
Oh. Oh. Haley's aversion.

05:47.557 --> 05:50.769
I thought you said-
Never mind.

05:58.777 --> 06:02.781
Okay. So after you have turned on the
monitor and selected your input,

06:02.864 --> 06:04.991
you can change the channel
with this guy.

06:05.116 --> 06:07.661
But if you need to change
the volume- You know what?

06:07.744 --> 06:09.454
I think I'm fine. Why
don't you just go ahead?

06:09.538 --> 06:11.039
I know this sounds
really confusing,

06:11.122 --> 06:12.916
but there's actually a very
simple way to remember it.

06:12.999 --> 06:15.835
# Input one is the cable box #

06:15.961 --> 06:18.505
# Cable box, cable box- ##
I think I'm just gonna take a nap.

06:18.630 --> 06:22.676
Okay. I'm goin' to yoga.
That sounds like so much fun.

06:22.759 --> 06:25.262
- You should go with her, Gloria. -We
should definitely do that sometime.

06:25.387 --> 06:27.597
I would love it. Bye.

06:27.681 --> 06:30.475
Do you see how she gives me
the cold shoulders?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.686
I don't even know why I try.

06:32.769 --> 06:35.355
Oh, well, that's just Claire.
You know? She's a Pritchett.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.732
You gotta break
through those walls.

06:37.816 --> 06:40.610
- The sooner, the better.
- You really think so?

06:40.694 --> 06:43.655
Yeah. Why don't you go? Now.
Forge that friendship.

06:43.738 --> 06:46.616
Okay, I go. I have
my gym bag in the car.

06:46.741 --> 06:48.577
Feel better!
Okay. Thank you.

06:48.702 --> 06:52.539
I'm just gonna lie here, some ice on my back.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.883
I knew for a fact Claire
never returned my Tupperware.

07:03.967 --> 07:06.011
I just needed a few minutes
alone to find it.

07:06.094 --> 07:09.681
And when I did, I'd never have to
hear them snicker again.

07:09.764 --> 07:12.225
"Oh, silly Cam."
Or "forgetful Cam."

07:12.309 --> 07:15.604
Because revenge is a dish
best sewed cold.

07:15.687 --> 07:18.023
And even better two days later
out of a 24-ounce,

07:18.106 --> 07:21.026
microwave-friendly,
burp-sealed Pak-N-Stor.

07:32.037 --> 07:34.289
Oh, hey. I thought you were
going to the pharmacy.

07:34.414 --> 07:36.082
I forgot my phone.
Oh.

07:36.166 --> 07:39.085
Oh! I think I'm just upset about
this stupid thing with my dad.

07:39.169 --> 07:40.629
Sweetie, I'd love
to hear about it...

07:40.712 --> 07:42.547
when you come back with my
heating pad from the pharmacy.

07:42.631 --> 07:44.090
Because I hurt my back,
remember?

07:44.174 --> 07:46.760
I mean,
did he overreact or what?

07:46.843 --> 07:48.303
It's just a game, right?

07:48.386 --> 07:50.555
Well, unless there's
something more to it.

07:51.473 --> 07:53.016
Maybe you should
go talk to him.

07:53.141 --> 07:55.143
Yeah.
Huh?

07:55.226 --> 07:56.728
I should've just
kept my mouth shut.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.396
I mean, it was
such a great day.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.900
After he thought he got that hole
in one, he took us out to dinner.

08:02.025 --> 08:04.235
He bought me my first beer.
Well, there you go.

08:04.319 --> 08:07.364
He's probably hurt because you marred
a very special father-son experience.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.199
- You think?
- You marred it.

08:09.282 --> 08:10.950
But you can fix it.

08:11.034 --> 08:13.119
He's down at the club
right now.

08:13.203 --> 08:16.039
Go, Mitchell!
Un-mar that memory!

08:16.122 --> 08:17.874
You know what?
I'm gonna do it.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.167
Ow.
Sorry.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.710
Don't worry.
I'll be back soon.

08:20.794 --> 08:23.088
Okay. I'll miss you.
Call first.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.889
What were you thinking,
saying that in front of him?

08:32.972 --> 08:34.432
I'm sorry.
It slipped out.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.351
Besides, I figured he knew.
Mom knows.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.395
Only because she
dragged it out of Dylan.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.356
And she promised not to tell
dad until I left for college,

08:41.438 --> 08:44.693
which means he might
have never found out.

08:44.776 --> 08:47.696
Stop panicking. We don't even know
for sure he heard what I said.

08:47.779 --> 08:49.531
Okay. Beatrice
is with the nurse.

08:49.614 --> 08:51.366
They'll call us.
Shouldn't be too long.

08:51.449 --> 08:54.828
We can just wait until she's
married- Until she's... ready.

08:54.911 --> 08:56.871
Which, apparently,
everyone is these days.

08:56.955 --> 08:58.915
Funny, I used to think it'd be years
until everyone was ready,

08:58.998 --> 09:00.917
but I guess I was wrong-
wrong and naive.

09:04.921 --> 09:06.840
Surprise!
Oh! Gloria!

09:06.923 --> 09:08.383
My God.

09:08.466 --> 09:09.801
I came to do yoga
with you.

09:09.884 --> 09:11.386
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

09:11.469 --> 09:13.138
A y, that's why
I say "Surprise!"

09:13.221 --> 09:14.931
Yeah. This is awful,

09:15.014 --> 09:17.517
because I was just thinking
I might have to bail on yoga.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.394
I have the worst headache
all of a sudden.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.229
But yoga is good
for that, Claire.

09:21.312 --> 09:23.356
For the meditation,
for the-

09:23.440 --> 09:25.150
Yeah, yeah.
it's just right now,

09:25.233 --> 09:27.986
I wanna go lie down
in a dark room and breathe.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.154
That sounds like yoga.

09:29.237 --> 09:31.865
L- I realize that. Yes.

09:31.990 --> 09:34.242
But still, I-l should go.
Come on.

09:34.325 --> 09:36.411
I'm not gonna
do the class by myself.

09:36.494 --> 09:38.413
Okay, so let's go
and get massages.

09:38.496 --> 09:40.248
Or there's
a nail salon there.

09:40.331 --> 09:42.375
I would love to do that some other time.
I really would.

09:42.459 --> 09:44.794
But right now, I need to
get home and lie down.

09:44.878 --> 09:46.504
- You understand, right?
- Of course.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.715
Okay.
You go!

09:50.383 --> 09:52.552
And lie.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.765
You're better! Oh!
Barely. Barely, yeah.

09:56.848 --> 10:00.477
- I was just getting something cold for my back.
- Gravy?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.812
Well, if it can save your mom's
turkey, it can save anything.

10:02.896 --> 10:04.606
I thought you were going
to see your friend Miranda.

10:04.689 --> 10:06.441
This one chickened out.

10:06.524 --> 10:08.276
For someone who says
he likes girls so much,

10:08.359 --> 10:09.736
he sure is afraid of them.

10:09.861 --> 10:12.572
It's a dance, Luke.
Chicken dance.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.950
Well, since you're back,
what if I give you 20 bucks...

10:16.034 --> 10:19.662
and YOU guys...
go wash my car?

10:21.122 --> 10:23.750
Is that 20 bucks for each
of us or both of us?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.126
Both.

10:25.210 --> 10:26.961
That's what I thought.

10:35.011 --> 10:38.056
Uh-oh, check it out. Ace is
drooling over his plaque again.

10:38.139 --> 10:41.100
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
smell you idiots come in.

10:41.184 --> 10:44.729
Listen, I've been thinking, maybe
it's time we retire the name "Ace."

10:44.813 --> 10:46.981
You mean the name you had
printed on your golf cap?

10:47.065 --> 10:48.775
- And his robe.
- You know, guys, about that-

10:48.858 --> 10:52.445
Remember how mad he got when I yanked
that cap off his head and put it on?

10:52.529 --> 10:54.155
"You got to earn that!"

10:54.239 --> 10:56.991
I'm just glad one of those cheap
hair plugs didn't get caught in it.

10:57.075 --> 10:58.993
For the millionth time,
they're not plugs.

10:59.077 --> 11:00.954
So what, your hair just
came back when you turned 50?

11:01.079 --> 11:03.456
Unlike your wife.
Hey, that was a blessing.

11:03.540 --> 11:05.583
Otherwise, I wouldn't be taking
out Natalie Hobbs tonight.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.418
Taking her out
or doing her taxes?

11:07.502 --> 11:11.840
I'm trying to find a way to come clean about
the hole in one, when it occurs to me-

11:11.923 --> 11:13.383
Why?

11:13.466 --> 11:15.510
One idiot lies
about his sex life.

11:15.593 --> 11:19.347
The other dumbbell has a Ferrari
"in the shop" for years.

11:19.430 --> 11:22.684
And moron number three
is a Hollywood stunt car driver...

11:22.767 --> 11:26.229
who gets sick when he rides
backwards in the golf cart.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.857
So, you ladies ready
to tee off or what?

11:28.940 --> 11:30.441
Just gotta
settle up our tab.

11:30.525 --> 11:32.694
- I took care of it.
- You said you were going to the restroom.

11:32.777 --> 11:34.821
Ah! Can't trust a word
out of this guy's mouth.

11:34.904 --> 11:36.573
Twenty years we've been
falling for this.

11:36.656 --> 11:39.701
I-I'm sorry to interrupt, but
my dad never lied to you guys.

11:39.826 --> 11:41.703
Mitchell. No, he didn't
even know until today...

11:41.828 --> 11:43.371
that he never made the hole in one.
Okay.

11:43.454 --> 11:46.541
But the fact that he couldn't live
with himself when he found out...

11:46.624 --> 11:48.501
and he raced down here
to confess to you,

11:48.585 --> 11:51.254
that just shows
the kind of man he is.

11:51.337 --> 11:54.048
He is a "hole in one"
kind of man.

11:54.132 --> 11:56.009
You never
got a hole in one?

11:56.092 --> 11:57.802
I didn't tell them.

11:59.012 --> 12:02.140
So this is the gang.
Introduce me.

12:04.601 --> 12:07.687
Ah! Score!

12:07.770 --> 12:09.898
It's not like me and Miranda
are perfectly suited.

12:09.981 --> 12:12.275
For one thing, she likes bad boys.
That's just not me.

12:12.358 --> 12:14.611
I'm gonna turn on some music.

12:14.736 --> 12:17.405
I'm sorry. I can't unlearn
how to treat a lady.

12:17.488 --> 12:19.324
But where does that leave me-
waiting till I'm 40,

12:19.407 --> 12:21.993
when she looks me up on Facebook
after her failed first marriage?

12:22.076 --> 12:24.412
Okay.

12:24.537 --> 12:27.540
What are you doing? I'm sick of
hearing you whine about Miranda!

12:27.665 --> 12:29.876
It's time to make her notice you!
But we can't!

12:29.959 --> 12:32.086
We got a full tank of gas, and
she's right down the block.

12:32.211 --> 12:33.922
Now buckle up.
Are you crazy?

12:34.005 --> 12:35.006
You tell me.

12:35.089 --> 12:40.595
Whoo! Whoo!

12:40.678 --> 12:44.849
Whoo! Whoo!

12:49.437 --> 12:51.356
Lily, what is this?

12:51.439 --> 12:54.776
Wouldn't you rather have a
chemistry set or some flash cards?

12:54.859 --> 12:57.111
She's pretty.

12:57.195 --> 12:58.613
No. No, she's dirty.

12:58.696 --> 13:00.865
Look. Look at the dirt.

13:00.949 --> 13:02.659
Let me wipe her off.

13:02.742 --> 13:05.328
Fix that.

13:05.411 --> 13:07.664
Her braid's coming loose.
Come here.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.751
Fix that right up.

13:11.834 --> 13:16.339
So I've completed the examination.
She did really well.

13:16.422 --> 13:17.548
What's the prognosis?

13:17.632 --> 13:19.717
We can fix
most of her arm,

13:19.801 --> 13:23.513
but she'll never regain full
mobility in her shoulder joint,

13:23.596 --> 13:25.807
because they don't make
that part anymore.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.308
Well, that's pretty good,
right?

13:27.392 --> 13:29.852
I mean, she'll look exactly the same.
No one will know.

13:29.936 --> 13:31.396
I'll know.

13:31.479 --> 13:32.981
Uh-

13:33.064 --> 13:34.983
I'm just saying
I liked her the way she was.

13:35.066 --> 13:36.985
She was such
a sweet little doll.

13:37.068 --> 13:40.029
I'm sorry, Doc. I'm having
trouble adjusting to all this.

13:40.113 --> 13:42.490
Uh, Dad, she's still
a sweet little doll.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.784
No, she's broken.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.786
No, she's just
changed a little.

13:46.911 --> 13:50.456
It happens. Dolls grow up.
Well, actually-

13:50.540 --> 13:52.250
Uh, could you-
Yeah. Sure.

13:52.333 --> 13:55.753
I actually have to go give a
little girl some pretty bad news.

13:59.382 --> 14:00.967
So, Haley.

14:03.678 --> 14:05.388
The thing is-

14:05.471 --> 14:08.099
Fact- Haley's almost 18.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.768
Fact- I am the cool dad.

14:12.478 --> 14:15.231
Haley, I understand
that sex is a part of life.

14:15.314 --> 14:18.026
I can't say that I'm thrilled to hear
this, but I'm sure you're being safe,

14:18.109 --> 14:20.987
and I hope that you'll feel free
to talk to me about this anytime.

14:24.449 --> 14:28.244
We should- We should probably get
Beatrice, like, a cast or something.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.996
We can all sign it.

14:30.121 --> 14:32.665
Yeah?
Uh, yeah. Sure.

14:32.749 --> 14:35.460
Fact- I blew it.

14:37.086 --> 14:38.546
This repair's probably
gonna take a little while.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.965
Why don't you run up to the
food court and grab us a table?

14:41.090 --> 14:43.801
I'll get Alex and Lily.
Okay.

14:45.845 --> 14:47.805
Do you want the counter
or a booth?

14:49.724 --> 14:51.476
Whatever seems right to you.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.022
I trust you.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.319
I have a cool dad.

15:06.199 --> 15:09.202
Okay. Your turn.
Uh-uh! No way!

15:09.285 --> 15:11.788
Do you want to get
her attention or not?

15:13.456 --> 15:15.833
# Yeah #

15:15.917 --> 15:17.251
# Ah! Ah! #

15:18.294 --> 15:19.837
# Uh! #

15:19.921 --> 15:22.548
# Yeah
Uh! Uh! Uh! #

15:22.632 --> 15:24.592
# Yeah #

15:24.675 --> 15:28.679
# Uh let's- let's ride
Gotta hit the street #

15:28.763 --> 15:30.348
That was amazing!

15:30.431 --> 15:32.391
Did you see the look
on Miranda's face?

15:32.475 --> 15:34.936
No. But you did good,
Thelma.

15:35.019 --> 15:37.438
Please stop calling me that.
I hate that movie.

15:37.522 --> 15:39.565
What movie?

15:39.690 --> 15:42.610
Uh-oh! Dead end.
You gotta make a U-ey.

15:42.693 --> 15:45.238
I don't know
how to do that.

15:52.495 --> 15:54.956
# Ride, gotta hit the street
We pack the heat ##

15:55.039 --> 15:56.791
She pretended
to have a headache, Cam.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.668
She doesn't want
to spend time with me.

15:58.751 --> 16:00.711
Maybe she just wanted
to be alone.

16:00.795 --> 16:02.296
Why?

16:02.380 --> 16:05.383
Because some people really
value their privacy,

16:05.466 --> 16:07.093
and you have
to respect that.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.972
I have to go.

16:11.055 --> 16:13.057
Hola, Claire!

16:13.141 --> 16:15.268
Gloria, you've gotta
stop doing that!

16:15.351 --> 16:18.229
Were you going back to the
yoga class without me?

16:18.312 --> 16:20.314
No, that is not
why I came back.

16:20.398 --> 16:21.941
I don't understand you.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.734
Why you don't want
to spend time with me?

16:23.818 --> 16:25.778
Everybody wants
to spend time with me.

16:25.862 --> 16:28.948
Even the lady that did my nails
wants to take me to Pilates.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.992
I didn't come back here
to do yoga.

16:31.075 --> 16:33.202
I don't do yoga.
it's a cover, okay?

16:33.286 --> 16:36.497
Look. I know that,
from the outside,

16:36.581 --> 16:38.499
it seems like I have
everything together.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.835
No, not really.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.920
My point is that my life
can be very stressful.

16:43.004 --> 16:45.923
And I have found a way
to cope with that stress.

16:46.007 --> 16:48.843
And it's my little secret,
and I'm not proud of it.

16:48.968 --> 16:51.345
Hey, Claire. See you inside.
Hey.

16:51.429 --> 16:53.181
Is that what you do?

16:53.264 --> 16:55.683
No. No!

16:55.766 --> 16:58.519
Okay. You're coming
with me. Come in.

16:58.603 --> 17:01.314
But listen to me, Gloria.

17:01.397 --> 17:03.316
It has to stay between us.

17:03.399 --> 17:06.402
This is my sacred space.

17:10.239 --> 17:13.534
It's just
such a great release.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.703
- Thank you for not judging me.
- Why would I?

17:15.786 --> 17:17.454
If anything, it makes me
like you more.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.165
Mmm. So, how often
do you come here?

17:19.248 --> 17:21.459
Not that often. No.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.002
Hey. Maybe a little often.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.171
That's so sad.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.964
I live with four teenagers.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.425
You live with two adults.
You have no idea- No,no,no.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.177
It's so sad that you
come here so often...

17:31.302 --> 17:33.554
and that's the best
that you can shoot. Oh!

17:35.306 --> 17:36.766
And that's
with pretty nails.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.268
But improper stance. I- Okay.
Practice more.

17:39.352 --> 17:41.520
Here you go, Ace.

17:41.604 --> 17:43.564
I mean- What is
your real name?

17:43.648 --> 17:45.149
Jay.

17:46.609 --> 17:49.654
Dad, I- I told you,
forget about it.

17:49.737 --> 17:51.239
All right. Look.

17:51.322 --> 17:54.784
I just want you to know I
get why you're upset, okay?

17:54.867 --> 17:57.203
That day you got the hole in
one, it meant a lot to you.

17:57.286 --> 18:01.082
And... l- I marred it.

18:01.165 --> 18:03.251
But it meant a lot
to me too.

18:03.334 --> 18:04.794
We had a steak dinner,

18:04.877 --> 18:07.713
you gave me my first beer,
and,uh,

18:07.797 --> 18:10.299
it was one of the greatest days
we ever spent together.

18:10.383 --> 18:13.928
And it wasn't about some meaningless
hole in one. It was about us.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.514
No. It was about
a hole in one.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.432
Yes. Yes.
A-A little bit, maybe.

18:18.516 --> 18:21.060
But mostly, it was
about how we bonded.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.522
I thought I hit a ball
straight from a tee...

18:24.605 --> 18:27.692
really, really far
into a tiny hole.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.986
Okay.

18:30.069 --> 18:32.029
God, when will I learn?

18:35.449 --> 18:36.742
And it wasn't
your first beer anyway.

18:36.826 --> 18:39.078
Yes, it was, Dad, but I wouldn't
expect you to remember.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.290
It was your 14th birthday.

18:42.373 --> 18:43.958
You asked me
for a sip of mine.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.918
Your mom yelled at you
in front of all your friends,

18:46.002 --> 18:48.087
said you were
just a baby.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.172
You ran outside in tears,

18:50.256 --> 18:53.467
which, unfortunately,
supported your mom's argument.

18:53.551 --> 18:56.637
Anyway, I came out
with a couple of beers.

18:56.721 --> 19:00.224
We drank 'em on the porch, watching
the storm clouds coming in.

19:03.227 --> 19:06.188
I had completely forgotten
about that.

19:06.272 --> 19:08.357
You know, you're- you're unbelievable.
Just when I peg you as-

19:08.441 --> 19:09.900
Storm Stevens!
That's it!

19:09.984 --> 19:12.611
Give me something. I'm
gonna write it right here.

19:12.737 --> 19:15.364
Before I forget. "Storm
Stevens." Stevens.

19:17.158 --> 19:18.659
What were we just talking
about, just now?

19:18.743 --> 19:20.661
Oh.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.288
No?
Mm-mmm.

19:22.371 --> 19:25.124
Come on, Lily.
Let's see if Beatrice is ready.

19:30.588 --> 19:32.631
Hey, Dad.

19:32.715 --> 19:34.425
I know I'm way
too old for this,

19:34.508 --> 19:36.510
but do you think
I could get this doll?

19:36.594 --> 19:39.013
Her name's Genevieve, and she's
developing a vaccine for-

19:39.096 --> 19:42.308
Yes, you can get the doll. You can
get as many dolls as you want.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.602
It's $200.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.146
Or one is fine.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.441
I know you're here.

19:52.860 --> 19:56.113
Hello.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.993
I have a bad
feeling about this.

20:01.077 --> 20:02.536
What if one of your
neighbors saw us?

20:02.620 --> 20:04.288
Maybe we should
just confess.

20:04.372 --> 20:06.957
We will... in 20 years.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.793
Huh?
You heard Grandpa.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.586
There's a statute
of limitations,

20:10.669 --> 20:13.756
which is a good thing, because
we still need to take Lily down.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.549
Nah, let her be
the cute one.

20:15.633 --> 20:18.677
We don't need that anymore.
We're bad boys now.

20:18.761 --> 20:22.723
Yeah. I like that.
Bad boys.

20:22.848 --> 20:24.558
Your mom!

20:30.856 --> 20:32.525
Oh, my God.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.151
Cam!

20:34.235 --> 20:36.278
Um, this had a lid.

20:41.534 --> 20:43.369
I'll see you guys later.
I'm going to Abby's.

20:43.494 --> 20:47.331
Bye, honey. Have fun. Have fun, you.
With Abby.

20:47.456 --> 20:50.167
We've confirmed
Abby's a real person and a female?

20:50.251 --> 20:52.586
Yes, sweetie. We met her.

20:52.670 --> 20:55.297
Honey, we can't treat
Haley differently...

20:55.381 --> 20:57.675
just because we both know
what we know about her.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.261
I know. I just need time.

21:02.471 --> 21:04.181
So Dylan told you?

21:04.265 --> 21:06.559
Why didn't he tell me? He and
I used to share everything.

21:06.642 --> 21:08.894
You're upset
about a lot of things.

21:08.978 --> 21:12.231
Okay, I won't obsess over it.

21:12.356 --> 21:15.067
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Hmm?

21:15.192 --> 21:18.737
How long have you known?
Three months.

21:18.821 --> 21:22.408
So this giant thing
happened to our firstborn,

21:22.491 --> 21:25.453
and you kept me in the dark
about it for three whole months?

21:25.536 --> 21:28.205
I'm sorry. I just wasn't sure
how you'd- Okay.

21:28.289 --> 21:29.748
Thank you.
