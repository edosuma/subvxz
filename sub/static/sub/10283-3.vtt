WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:06.407
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.407 --> 00:07.641
Officer on deck!

00:09.277 --> 00:10.478
Me. I'm the chief.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.080
Yeah, Chief Pain-In-The-Ass.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.414
Welcome to County, Inez.
Thank you.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.183
I don't need anything from you.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.550
I never have.
Don't come back anymore.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.353
But I couldn't leave
without seeing you.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.457
I need to think
things out by myself.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.692
Where are you going now?

00:24.692 --> 00:25.793
I'm going to look
at an apartment

00:25.793 --> 00:27.428
before work.
So what? That,

00:27.428 --> 00:28.562
That's it?
We don't talk about this?

00:28.562 --> 00:29.597
Sam's moving out.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.433
Oh.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.135
Why?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.604
I got a feeling it's our
communication problem.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.447 --> 00:48.549
MAN:
What did you say
your name was again?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.451
I didn't.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.586
( horse whinnies )

00:52.586 --> 00:55.389
MAN:
No. I guess you didn't
at that, did you?

01:05.465 --> 01:07.268
Ay, Dios mio.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.236
Morning, Zoila.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.770
I think you at work.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.805
First Thursday
of the month

01:11.805 --> 01:13.474
is when Samantha
told me to come.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.808
I'm running a little bit late.

01:14.808 --> 01:15.843
You don't have
to clean up today.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.311
But Samantha say...

01:17.311 --> 01:20.481
Samantha doesn't
live here anymore.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.217
Um, I'll, uh... I'll,

01:23.217 --> 01:25.253
I'll have her call you.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.623
All these was at the lobby.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.292
Mm-hmm.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.160
The dishes...

01:32.160 --> 01:33.827
Hmm?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.529
You're going to get cucarachas.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.167
Currently, patient
throughput is 8.7...

01:39.167 --> 01:40.501
Pow! Pow!

01:40.501 --> 01:42.170
Now the problem is...

01:42.170 --> 01:44.405
Dr. Weaver, can we...
Not a good
time, Morris.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.307
If they need to be admitted
to the hospital,

01:46.307 --> 01:47.508
that goes up to over 19 hours.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.809
Certainly room
for improvement.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.544
That's where
Caduceus Systematics

01:50.544 --> 01:51.912
come into the picture.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.181
Houston, we have a problem!

01:53.181 --> 01:54.182
Okay, one moment.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.316
Why don't you, um... here.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.885
Take a look at these.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.387
Hey!

01:59.387 --> 02:00.621
Keep it down, Doctor.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.922
I've got grant
officers with me.

02:01.922 --> 02:02.790
Grant officers? Ka-ching.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.558
All right.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.660
They're considering funding
a pilot study here at County.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.362
Kudos to you. Now,

02:08.362 --> 02:10.231
what do we do about
this new nurse czar,

02:10.231 --> 02:11.565
Eve something or other?

02:11.565 --> 02:13.234
Peyton.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.535
She came in to meet with the
Emergency Services Committee

02:14.535 --> 02:16.204
and we all loved her.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.672
Is it her job to slow the
floor down to a crawl?

02:18.672 --> 02:20.441
I thought that
was your job.
My point being.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.709
All the nurses,
they're all in there

02:21.709 --> 02:23.411
just yakking away.
They're entitled

02:23.411 --> 02:24.912
to a staff
meeting, Morris.
Not unless I say so.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.216
We say so.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.519
Not unless Dr. Weaver says so.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.853
Exactly. Who's the
attending on today?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.588
Supposed to be Susan.
Yeah, well,

02:34.588 --> 02:36.224
that's not
going to happen.
So, it's true?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.359
She's leaving
for a tenure position?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.594
WEAVER:
Not yet. She's just,
uh, interviewing.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.862
Isn't Kovac coming in?

02:41.862 --> 02:42.730
He's running
a little late.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.897
So, what else is new?

02:43.897 --> 02:44.832
Uh, Dr. Weaver?

02:44.832 --> 02:46.434
Hold down the fort.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.302
When's the last time
anybody even saw a nurse?

02:48.302 --> 02:51.339
Oh... Malik did an EKG
for me six minutes ago.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.606
Just let them
have their powwow.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.908
No. Chief say
powwow over.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.610
( chuckles )

02:56.610 --> 02:58.412
Guess he hasn't met the
new nurse manager yet.

02:58.412 --> 03:02.350
Uh, as part of the, um, upcoming
JCAHO site visit,

03:02.350 --> 03:03.817
any individual practitioners...

03:03.817 --> 03:05.253
I need you
to step out.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.420
can and will
be asked...
What?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.655
specific questions
by the surveyor.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.290
So, I need you
to become very familiar

03:09.290 --> 03:10.724
with this booklet
here, okay...
Shut up.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.360
I need a nurse, okay?

03:12.360 --> 03:13.494
I'm sorry.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.696
Dr... Morris, is it?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.367
Yeah, I, uh...

03:19.367 --> 03:21.335
have a patient
with an abscessed tooth.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.903
Needs I.V. penicillin.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.838
You need one of us
to administer

03:24.838 --> 03:26.474
I.V. antibiotics for you?

03:26.474 --> 03:28.342
That's what nurses do.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.943
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.613
I wasn't aware of any literature
on the benefits of I.V.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.415
antibiotics in dental
infections.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.716
Literature?

03:35.716 --> 03:36.817
And as far

03:36.817 --> 03:37.951
as I know, oral antibiotics

03:37.951 --> 03:39.520
are still the standard of care.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.354
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.689
Oh, good.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.291
Then maybe you
can educate the nurses

03:43.291 --> 03:46.026
about inferior
alveolar dental blocks.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.295
What?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.662
WEAVER:
Doing a study

03:48.662 --> 03:51.399
to track patients
is the best way to determine

03:51.399 --> 03:52.833
how to improve...

03:52.833 --> 03:54.868
Uh... Hey. Tony,

03:54.868 --> 03:57.338
can you give my friends here
a tour of the rig?

03:57.338 --> 03:58.572
Sure thing, Dr. Weaver.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.508
Your shift started

04:00.508 --> 04:01.575
40 minutes ago.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.876
Morning, Kerry.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.011
There's no attending
on the floor.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.513
Well, we seem
to have a shortage.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.914
Then don't make
me come looking

04:06.914 --> 04:08.516
for you.
Can we talk about
this later please?

04:08.516 --> 04:09.850
Okay. No, I need
to know that...

04:09.850 --> 04:12.686
( man screaming in agony )

04:14.955 --> 04:16.524
Sir! Stop where you are, sir!

04:16.524 --> 04:17.825
( screaming )

04:19.327 --> 04:21.362
I need a gurney here!

04:21.362 --> 04:24.332
( gasping and screaming )

05:15.449 --> 05:16.684
So, did you straighten
those nurses out, Chief?

05:16.684 --> 05:17.685
Uh, they are autonomous
professionals.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.986
If they want to have a meeting,

05:18.986 --> 05:19.987
we're in no position
to question that.

05:19.987 --> 05:20.821
She spanked you raw, huh?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.923
It was all a blur.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.992
Can't find a femoral pulse
through the eschar.
Ayudame! Ayudame!

05:24.992 --> 05:26.527
He's got a carotid
of two plus.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.828
Need a hand
with that?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.397
We got this, but can
you check on my guests?

05:29.397 --> 05:30.998
They looked a little
freaked. Hey!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.400
Sam, we need a nurse here.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.034
Inez, you go, too.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.705
Unidentified burn victim-- no
history, walked himself in.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.641
Do you want me to start
an I.V. or check the B.P.?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.142
Yeah, fine.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.144
WEAVER:
Access, vitals, fluids.
Let's go!

05:44.144 --> 05:45.513
( gasping )

05:47.147 --> 05:48.416
What's up with the camera?

05:48.416 --> 05:49.750
Sending Michael a care package.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.018
To Iraq?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.786
Figured I'd include
photos of everyone.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.155
Is there anything
you want to send?

05:55.155 --> 05:56.023
Sure.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.558
Like what?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.159
Well, something you
think he'd miss.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.528
Something he can't
get there.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.595
Exactamundo.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.763
Oh, a movie, huh?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.097
It's not a bad idea.
Yeah.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.667
Let me put it
this way: it ain't Disney.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.502
I know you're not
sending him porn.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.003
Just a little
three-way, nothing dirty.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.071
Oh, I like the way
you think, Frank.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.073
I'm not mailing this.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.609
He'll get in trouble
and I'll get arrested.
No, no.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.745
I buried it inside some nature
snoozefest about snow leopards.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.447
That'll get it past

06:19.447 --> 06:21.615
those Army hounds.
This cannot be
a good idea.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.883
Listen, dear,
I've been to war.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.518
I know how horny
a guy can get.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.186
Yeah, thanks...
Frank. That'll do.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.656
KJ, I need you to make
a run for me, man.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.157
Again? I just
got back

06:30.157 --> 06:31.492
from getting her
that camera.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.026
Hey, hey, hey.
No slouching, right?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.928
Like a shark.
Now, take this $20.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.164
What I want
you to do is...
The generous Dr. Pratt.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.567
Catch me in a minute--

06:39.567 --> 06:41.068
and help restock that cart.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.536
What are you doing here?

06:42.536 --> 06:43.704
Aren't we still
getting together later?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.138
Yeah, but I had
a case upstairs,

06:45.138 --> 06:46.039
so I thought I'd stop by.

06:46.039 --> 06:46.974
Oh. What case?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.008
11-year-old Latin queen

06:48.008 --> 06:49.477
recovering from a stab wound.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.178
The knife missed her
heart by an inch.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.180
Wow. How's
she doing?
Tells me she made one mistake.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.782
She should have
stabbed the bitch first.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.884
Aren't they so
cute at that age?

06:56.884 --> 06:59.887
You got anything for me?

06:59.887 --> 07:01.522
I always got
something for you.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.556
I meant work.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.557
Ah.
Mmm.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.092
No GSWs yet,

07:05.092 --> 07:06.560
but the day is
still young.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.861
I saw Charlie Pratt
at Ceasefire.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.797
He said he stopped
by here last week.

07:09.797 --> 07:10.898
How'd it go?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.600
Quick.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.001
It was quick.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.237
I mean, we really have
nothing to talk about.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.539
Okay. Um... so,

07:18.539 --> 07:19.573
I'll see you
for lunch then?

07:19.573 --> 07:20.741
Definitely.
All right.

07:25.078 --> 07:25.846
( patient coughing )

07:25.846 --> 07:26.947
Lungs are wet!

07:26.947 --> 07:28.549
He's very tachy.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.084
I need that line, please.
I'm working on it.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.686
Tranquilo, señor.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.187
Como se llama?
( shrieks )

07:34.187 --> 07:35.222
Ayudeme!
Ayudeme!

07:35.222 --> 07:36.557
INEZ:
Que paso?

07:36.557 --> 07:37.691
No se.
Morphine and fluids.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.959
We need access, Sam.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.761
I know,
I know.
No I.D. and

07:40.761 --> 07:42.162
he doesn't know
what happened.
Worry about I.D.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.531
after you've got
him on a monitor.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.565
I was getting...
And start a foley

07:44.565 --> 07:46.033
to document renal function.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.601
Got it!

07:47.601 --> 07:49.136
18 gauge in the left antecube.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.705
A liter wide open!

07:51.705 --> 07:54.575
Feet and perineum
are clear of burns.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.743
Sam, what are you doing?

07:55.743 --> 07:56.710
I'm gonna hang saline.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.879
I can see that. Why?

07:58.879 --> 08:01.782
Because, uh, fluid requirements
are 4 cc's per kilo.

08:01.782 --> 08:02.783
Good, so
you're familiar

08:02.783 --> 08:04.151
with the Parkland formula?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.853
( coughing )
Yeah.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.220
Well then, you must know
that lactated ringers

08:07.220 --> 08:08.656
is the preferred crystalloid.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.857
Excuse me?

08:09.857 --> 08:12.225
Oh, uh, Dr. Ko-vak,
I'm Eve Peyton.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.594
Our new nurse manager.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.828
It's "Kovach."

08:15.963 --> 08:17.865
Sats are down to 78.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.066
This is a bad time to start

08:19.066 --> 08:20.768
pimping the
nursing staff.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.736
The worst times are usually
the best times to learn.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.737
Didn't Yoda say that?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.606
Suction.
Suction.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.974
All right.
You've got this.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.610
Eve, why don't you,
uh, come with me

08:29.610 --> 08:31.579
and I'll introduce you
to the bean-counters.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.580
All right.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.683
Did you call that woman?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.150
Yes. Your daughter's
on her way.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.619
Oh, hey, hey.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.220
You might want to
check in on Penny.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.621
Penny Nicholson?

08:41.621 --> 08:43.591
If at first you
don't succeed...

08:46.727 --> 08:47.728
Believe that would
be my kidney?

08:47.728 --> 08:48.729
Hi, Penny.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.030
Hi. Nice
to see you again.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.264
I'm Dr.
Rasgotra,
Mr...?

08:51.264 --> 08:52.132
Trimbody.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.233
It's my stage name.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.702
How apt.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.103
Do elementary school
health shows.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.905
"The Respiratory Rumba,"

08:57.905 --> 09:00.140
"Hi-Gene, Good-bye B.O.,"
"The Heart Is a Lonely Beater."

09:00.140 --> 09:01.942
We get it.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.143
Discomfort after a fall.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.645
Slipped on a
puddle of Jell-O

09:04.645 --> 09:06.079
in the cafetorium
right in the middle

09:06.079 --> 09:08.649
of my musical number on
the reproductive system,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.083
"Ova Here, Ova There."

09:10.083 --> 09:11.819
Breath sounds are equal.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.286
Check for splenic tenderness.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.988
All right.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.857
( moans )

09:16.857 --> 09:17.825
Take a deep
breath, sir.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.631
She was about to feel
my liver, wasn't she?

09:23.631 --> 09:24.765
I mean, come on,

09:24.765 --> 09:25.866
you're not in the fifth grade.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.768
My spleen is right here.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.836
There's no need
to get excited.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.771
Should I draw you a picture?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.106
Oh, look! I already have.
Miss Nicholson is
a medical student...

09:33.106 --> 09:35.743
The entire human anatomy!
Actually, sir,
it's not!

09:36.844 --> 09:39.780
You have no genitalia.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.655
Ready?

09:47.655 --> 09:48.722
Hmm?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.858
You blocked it.

09:50.858 --> 09:51.859
What's that for?

09:51.859 --> 09:52.559
Michael's
care package.

09:52.559 --> 09:53.927
I'm getting photos of everyone,

09:53.927 --> 09:56.029
plus anything people
want to send him.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.931
Frank's giving him porn.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.767
Ah. The gift
that keeps on giving.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.070
What are you going to send?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.873
Well, I made
this mix CD,

10:05.873 --> 10:09.142
but I don't know.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.078
"Weekend in New England,"

10:11.078 --> 10:12.680
"Mandy."

10:12.680 --> 10:14.081
Michael's got a weak
spot for Barry Manilow.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.049
Very weak.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.886
I could send him a menu from
Gibson's or a Cubs program,

10:18.886 --> 10:20.854
or I've got some pressed
flowers I could...

10:23.791 --> 10:25.225
You'll figure it out.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.661
Yeah. Here, sign
this for him.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.866
The lighting in here is brutal.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.101
MAN:
That's all you got from him?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.003
No family, no address?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.404
The guy was in pain, okay?

10:37.404 --> 10:39.873
Well, I'll go up with
you in case he wakes up.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.048
Uh, maintain the PEEP around ten

10:48.048 --> 10:51.985
and tell the unit they'll need
central monitoring on this guy.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.453
You didn't even
get a name?

10:53.453 --> 10:55.188
He really wasn't up
for an interview.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.967
Nice way to start the day, huh?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.435
Yeah.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.904
How's the new place?

11:10.904 --> 11:13.073
Uh, it's okay.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.775
You know, we're
getting used to it.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.943
Oh, here.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.811
Some of it's
a few days old.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.947
Oh, thank you.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.783
Are you gonna take Alex to that
soccer game on Saturday?

11:25.753 --> 11:26.854
Oh, if you still
want me to...

11:26.854 --> 11:28.055
Yeah. No, I think that...

11:28.055 --> 11:30.057
No, I mean I
wasn't sure that...

11:30.057 --> 11:33.226
No, I think, I
mean... you should.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.128
That could be good
for everybody.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.964
Well... okay.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.471
I was thinking...

11:49.442 --> 11:51.779
I've been thinking...

11:51.779 --> 11:53.146
we let things get away from us,

11:53.146 --> 11:54.782
but we don't have to...

11:54.782 --> 11:56.984
we don't have to
leave it like that.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.085
Luka...

11:58.085 --> 11:59.987
No. A lot
happened fast.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.056
Huh? Too fast.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.993
Maybe we should
just take our time,

12:05.993 --> 12:08.095
make sure we know
what we're doing.

12:10.463 --> 12:15.002
I don't want this to be
one more thing I messed up.

12:17.204 --> 12:20.007
We're pretending, Luka.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.810
I... don't want
to pretend anymore.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.545
Sam, do you have that...

12:25.545 --> 12:26.279
Uh, your piggyback.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.915
Yes. Right here.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.468
( groans )
I'm fine!

12:48.468 --> 12:50.137
Let me out of here!

12:50.137 --> 12:51.471
All right.
Sit down and relax, okay?

12:51.471 --> 12:52.906
How old are you?

12:52.906 --> 12:54.007
Sixteen.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.142
Pretty stupid.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.844
I got a 2,200
on my SATs.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.145
You work
for the county.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.580
Who's stupid?
( laughs )

13:00.580 --> 13:04.284
Two liters of saline,
send off a B.A.L.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.054
and don't light a match
around our little genius here.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.926
( laughs )

13:12.926 --> 13:14.995
That's why they call me
the "Whiz Kid."

13:14.995 --> 13:16.563
( laughs )
Oh, yeah!

13:16.563 --> 13:17.330
Okay.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.431
Go with God.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.034
Oh, yeah! Look at that.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.402
Oh, yeah.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.305
This is an 18 french foley
catheter, Erik.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.941
What's it for?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.144
I'll need you
to remove your pants.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.013
Labs are back on your U.T.I.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.447
Thanks.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.083
Uh, how's
your burn guy?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.184
In I.C.U.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.151
Any leads?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.120
Cops are looking into it.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.589
And he just walked
in here like that?

13:42.589 --> 13:45.492
High tolerance for pain,
I guess.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.996
Okay, well...

13:48.996 --> 13:50.931
uh, let me know
if you hear anything.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.033
Robbie Beckwith, 11,
blunt face and head.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.267
He was on one of those
motorized scooters,

13:54.267 --> 13:55.435
hit some lady
on skates.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.469
They're unloading her
right now.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.905
I'll get that one.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.439
Robbie, can you squeeze
my hand, please?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.041
Okay, Pratt should take this.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.910
He's altered
and he had no helmet. CT?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.311
Chuny, where's Pratt?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.313
With a new onset seizure in Two.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.248
Guess it's you and me.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.918
Yeah.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.119
Trauma panel,

14:12.119 --> 14:13.386
C-spine, chest and pelvis.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.487
Head and facial CT?

14:14.487 --> 14:15.455
After the plain films.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.489
Yankauer, please.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.025
My mom. I want my mom...

14:18.025 --> 14:19.326
They called her.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.061
She's on her way.
You lost a couple

14:21.061 --> 14:22.395
of teeth, Robbie.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.596
Wear a helmet
from now on, okay?

14:23.596 --> 14:24.464
I promise.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.333
Need anything here?

14:26.333 --> 14:28.335
No, we're probably
just going to tube him
and get him to CT.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.237
I'll call for a vent.
We may not need it.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.371
You're not going
to tube him?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.340
I don't know yet.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.475
Uh, well, I've got three nurses
here for the traumas.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.944
I can float in a fourth,

14:36.944 --> 14:38.578
if you want.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.147
( gurgling )

14:44.184 --> 14:45.418
There's a lot

14:45.418 --> 14:46.419
of bleeding
from the nasopharynx.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.620
Uh-huh.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.157
I can't visualize
the source.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.458
He's getting wheezy.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.594
Okay. He's going
to need help breathing.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.429
That's all
I was saying.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.631
I'm going in with Abby on
a diffuse abdominal pain.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.168
Why don't you show her how
to secure the airway?

15:01.168 --> 15:02.302
Really?

15:02.302 --> 15:03.636
Yeah.
I'll be next door.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.473
Seven O E.T.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.008
Sux...

15:08.008 --> 15:10.143
is on board.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.211
Pulse ox 99
on two liters.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.112
Pupils equal and reactive.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.380
What happened?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.347
We were rollerblading
by the lake.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.049
My first time.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.985
She got dizzy and rammed
into some kid on a scooter.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.219
No breakfast.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.353
I tried to catch her,
but I...

15:20.353 --> 15:21.554
Why are you wearing
those in here?

15:21.554 --> 15:24.324
We left our shoes
at the rental place.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.525
Good breath sounds
bilaterally.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.028
Have you ever had any seizures?

15:28.028 --> 15:28.996
Any heart problems?

15:28.996 --> 15:30.030
No, I'm healthy.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.198
You on any medications?

15:31.198 --> 15:33.000
Nothing.
Just multivitamins.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.667
Hemocue's low-- 6.9.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.003
You ever been anemic before?

15:36.003 --> 15:37.004
No.

15:37.004 --> 15:37.670
Luka?
Hmm?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.472
Is that a burn?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.175
ABBY:
It's probably from
the scooter's tailpipe.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.410
Okay, belly CT,

15:43.410 --> 15:45.145
ultrasound,
two units of O-neg.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.313
Call surgery and hold an O.R.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.414
What's happening?

15:47.414 --> 15:48.615
She's losing blood somewhere.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.582
But I'm not even cut.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.251
No, it's internal.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.719
You guys good in here?
You mean like hemorrhaging?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.287
ABBY:
He needs that lac
looked at.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.655
Yes, he does.
Come with me.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.557
I'll be back soon,
Stephanie.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.259
Hey, how do you like
those things?

15:59.259 --> 16:02.029
They... they hurt
your knees at all?

16:02.029 --> 16:03.363
Ooh, that Morris guy--
what's he do?

16:03.363 --> 16:05.532
He's chief resident.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.400
No, seriously.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.072
Damn it.
There's a ton of blood.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.506
The cords are swollen.
What if you can't
get through?

16:13.506 --> 16:14.507
Then we move on
to Plan B.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.508
What's Plan B?

16:15.508 --> 16:16.743
Sam, set up the fiberoptic.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.545
How long will the
paralytics last?

16:18.545 --> 16:20.447
Look it up in the P.D.R.,
you'll remember it better.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.649
I got the scope,
but the light source,
got to find one.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.318
KOVAC:
Morrison's is clear,
no free fluid.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.519
Fiberoptic light source
in here?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.121
Uh, I saw it in Exam Three.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.756
How's it going
in there?

16:29.756 --> 16:31.124
It's going.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.492
First unit
of O-neg is up.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.461
No hemothorax.
Is that good?

16:34.461 --> 16:37.730
Yes, it is good, but it still
doesn't explain the blood loss.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.066
I'm here.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.567
Blunt abdomen,
severe anemia.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.135
FAST is negative.
B.P.?

16:42.135 --> 16:43.603
Uh, hasn't dropped yet.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.106
She's tachy, but maintaining
systolic of 110.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.107
Any pain there?

16:47.107 --> 16:48.475
Not really.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.077
Extra red top,
please. You.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.144
Here you go.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.579
Microscope?

16:52.579 --> 16:54.181
Obviously, there is an occult
bleeding source.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.182
Well, Dr. Kovac,

16:55.182 --> 16:56.283
normally this might be the part

16:56.283 --> 16:57.517
where we'd argue over whether

16:57.517 --> 16:59.419
you were hasty
in calling me down.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.521
I'd question the accuracy and
thoroughness of your assessment

17:01.521 --> 17:03.656
and we'd play mind games
in a futile attempt

17:03.656 --> 17:04.557
to one-up each other.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.492
But you know what?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.228
I'm just not
in the mood today.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.730
Why? I don't know.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.565
Lack of sleep,
stress.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.602
Maybe you people
have just worn me out.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.170
And yet, even then...

17:17.170 --> 17:20.339
Dr. Lockhart, what do you see?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.584
Microcytic
hypochromic anemia.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.153
And is that
an acute condition?

17:33.153 --> 17:35.122
No.
No, it is not.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.456
It is a chronic condition,

17:36.456 --> 17:38.291
the differential
of which includes...

17:38.291 --> 17:39.692
Iron deficiency,
thalassemia,

17:39.692 --> 17:41.628
sideroblastosis,
lead poisoning.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.430
Are any of those surgical?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.468
Anybody?

17:48.468 --> 17:49.469
New nurse?

17:51.771 --> 17:54.707
Next time, please consider
the innate skills and abilities

17:54.707 --> 17:56.343
that I suspect led us
all to be doctors.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.744
Dust them off

17:57.744 --> 18:00.680
and put them to use
before you summon me.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.450
Good luck, dear.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.322
Was it something you said?

18:11.891 --> 18:13.360
Light source is on high.
Sats are 92.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.761
All right, here we go.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.864
This is Mrs. Beckwith,
Robbie's mom.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.332
I've explained
the situation.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.733
Is he in a coma?

18:20.733 --> 18:21.768
No, ma'am.
He's just sedated.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.703
Oh, I told him to be careful

18:23.703 --> 18:24.837
on that thing, to wear a helmet.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.373
Turn up the suction.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.840
Has Dr. Kovac been in here?

18:29.642 --> 18:30.710
He left to work on that lady.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.248
Sam, crichoid pressure.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.249
Got it.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.652
Is he coming back?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.288
I'll go update him.
Here, Penny.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.258
You're sure you've
never been anemic?

18:45.258 --> 18:46.326
Positive.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.660
Ever had an ulcer?

18:47.660 --> 18:48.928
Luka.
What is it?

18:48.928 --> 18:50.363
You might want
to look in on this.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.531
Not right now.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.865
P.V.C.'s
on the monitor.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.301
KOVAC:
Okay, is the first unit in?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.568
PRATT:
No, I.V.'s
infiltrated.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.237
She's only got 50 c.c.'s.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.938
She needs some blood.
Is there anything
from your

18:58.938 --> 19:00.640
medical history that
we need to know about?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.442
Anything else you
can think of?

19:02.442 --> 19:03.943
Nothing important.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.646
I mean, I tested positive
for BRCA-one last year,

19:06.646 --> 19:07.714
but I'm tumor-free.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.616
BRCA-one?

19:09.616 --> 19:12.419
It's a genetic mutation that
indicates an increased risk

19:12.419 --> 19:13.553
of breast and ovarian cancer.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.356
Try an 85% chance, but I know
I don't have cancer yet.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.657
Man, I cannot
get an I.V.!

19:17.657 --> 19:18.791
Neither can I.

19:18.791 --> 19:19.926
Okay, set me up
for a central line.

19:19.926 --> 19:20.960
Betadine and
sterile gloves.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.729
Sats are in
the low 80's.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.231
Did Dr. Kovac say how long?

19:24.231 --> 19:25.332
Damn it!

19:25.332 --> 19:26.599
Actually,
he didn't say much.

19:26.599 --> 19:27.734
Let's get those sats up.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.968
Is he not
breathing right?

19:28.968 --> 19:30.637
Maybe you
should crike him?
Too young.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.406
It's not indicated
in children under 12.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.707
Line is primed
and ready.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.575
Dr. Kovac...
Guidewire.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.876
Cordis introducer.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.445
Dr. Pratt needs a more
experienced physician

19:38.445 --> 19:39.679
to help him
get the fiberoptic.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.981
Okay, wire is passing,
100 of lidocaine.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.450
Pratt is very experienced
with the airways.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.285
He'll get it.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.886
Stephanie, is there
anything unusual you
might have ingested?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.321
He needs you in there.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.556
Multifocal P.V.C.'s.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.990
This woman is
decompensating.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.825
And that child is hypoxic.

19:52.825 --> 19:53.726
Run of four.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.894
Because to fix it,

19:54.894 --> 19:56.263
we have to know
what it is.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.730
I didn't take anything.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.666
There should be an attending
in there.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.234
I'll be in as
soon as I can.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.703
Okay, then.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.272
Where's your difficult
airway box?

20:05.272 --> 20:06.673
It's over there.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.808
Do you work with
pottery or-or
stained glass?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.410
Those have heavy
metals in them.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.579
Excuse me, Miss Peyton...
I have a Ph.D.,

20:12.579 --> 20:15.815
so if you'd like
to get formal,
call me "Doctor."

20:15.815 --> 20:17.450
Open the crash cart.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.253
Stephanie, what is it?

20:20.253 --> 20:22.422
I've been going
to Mexico

20:22.422 --> 20:23.823
for treatments.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.258
To prevent cancer?

20:25.258 --> 20:27.794
A three-day juice fast

20:27.794 --> 20:29.429
with herbal enemas,

20:29.429 --> 20:32.799
and some natural medicine
to boost my immune system.

20:32.799 --> 20:33.966
Lead poisoning.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.034
Send a level.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.036
Okay, B.A.L.
35 milligram

20:37.036 --> 20:39.272
I.M. for chelation.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.773
Why didn't you say
something sooner?

20:40.773 --> 20:41.874
I was scared. I didn't know

20:41.874 --> 20:43.476
what it would do to my coverage.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.645
What's going on?

20:45.645 --> 20:46.813
Laryngeal mask airway.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.415
Tip of the cuff
on the palate

20:48.415 --> 20:50.450
and guide with your
index finger

20:50.450 --> 20:54.521
until you feel the
resistance of the
hypopharynx.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.456
And inflate.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.524
And bag.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.359
You might want
to educate

20:59.359 --> 21:01.060
your residents
about the L.M.A.
as a rescue device

21:01.060 --> 21:03.396
in "can't intubate, can't
ventilate" patients.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.798
TAGGART:
Sats are coming up.
It's working.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.367
Thank you.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.468
Thank you.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.370
Take it from here,
Doctor.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.339
I'm going to go
find a bedpan that
needs emptying.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.984
I didn't even know we
had LMAs on the floor.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.987
Been on order since July,
arrived last Friday.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.489
As part of my orientation,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.558
I went through the supply lists,
item by item.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.427
Oh, sounds like something
Weaver would make you do.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.729
Actually,
I did it on my own.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.466
Is there some sort of history
between you and Dr. Kovac?

21:39.466 --> 21:42.735
Uh, nothing to worry about.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.737
It's a nurse-doctor issue.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.439
If I don't worry
about it, who will?

21:46.439 --> 21:48.107
Uh...

21:48.107 --> 21:49.008
it's a personal thing.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.109
Won't come up again.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.644
Sam, is our kid up in CT?

21:51.644 --> 21:53.780
Uh, yeah, he's
with his mom.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.715
Hey, and since when
do we have LMAs?

21:55.715 --> 21:58.084
Since last Friday,
from what I'm told.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.652
I hope I didn't blow it.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.853
Kovac shouldn't have
left you.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.389
Yeah, but I told
him I had it.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.556
Hey, Dr. Pratt.
Got it.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.457
We all set up?

22:04.457 --> 22:05.458
Let's go find Neela.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.759
If I wasn't a feminist,

22:06.759 --> 22:08.461
I'd call that new
manager a bitch.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.597
She's all up in my stuff,
writing everything down.

22:10.597 --> 22:11.864
Are we getting
evaluated, Sam?

22:11.864 --> 22:13.866
I guess so.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.902
Beware the
Blood Countess.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.937
RASGOTRA:
A pizza?

22:17.937 --> 22:21.641
You want to send a pizza
to Iraq?

22:21.641 --> 22:23.476
It's a deep dish.
Mikey loves it.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.944
I understand that.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.446
Look, we got the dry ice,

22:26.446 --> 22:27.980
we got the waterproof shroud,
so...

22:27.980 --> 22:29.482
It's going to be a week
in transit.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.750
It will?

22:30.750 --> 22:32.084
I... I could look
into flash-freezing.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.520
It's all good.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.954
Just, you know,
take the picture.

22:34.954 --> 22:35.955
Come on.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.924
All right. All right.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.759
Say "cheese."

22:39.759 --> 22:41.994
Cheddar.
Cheddar.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.430
So, should I...

22:43.430 --> 22:45.064
No, don't worry
about it.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.433
I'll take care
of everything.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.736
I got this.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.975
What's the matter
with you, man?

22:55.975 --> 22:57.444
This thing won't
make it to Baghdad.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.445
What were you thinking?

22:58.445 --> 23:00.947
Hey. CT's on the line.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.450
Your, uh, scooter boy's
heart rate dropped.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.884
( whispers ):
Watch it.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.054
Is Stephanie okay?

23:08.054 --> 23:09.922
They said that I still
can't talk to her yet.

23:09.922 --> 23:14.461
How, uh... how deep
into this thing are you?

23:14.461 --> 23:15.495
What?

23:15.495 --> 23:17.664
Oh, um...

23:17.664 --> 23:18.998
we only met a few nights ago

23:18.998 --> 23:21.468
at a, uh, J speed-date.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.602
But we really
hit it off.

23:22.602 --> 23:23.703
J what?

23:23.703 --> 23:25.805
Oh, it's for Jewish singles.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.173
You go around
to each table,

23:27.173 --> 23:29.509
chatting for a few minutes
with each person.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.611
See who responds to whom.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.913
Oh.

23:33.913 --> 23:38.084
* Baruch Atah Adonai Elohaynu,
Melech Ha Olam... *

23:38.084 --> 23:40.687
Are you... Jewish?

23:40.687 --> 23:42.121
No, no, no, no.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.857
I had a crush on
a Semitic girl once.

23:44.857 --> 23:48.194
That's a, um... that's a holy
prayer that you just said.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.729
Yeah, yeah.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.230
I spent a lot of time
at synagogue,

23:51.230 --> 23:53.500
guess you could say
stalking her.

23:53.500 --> 23:57.136
Those rabbis, man--
they hit hard.

23:59.138 --> 24:02.775
I think I...
I really like her.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.776
Ow!
Sorry about that.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.811
( groans ):
Ah!

24:04.811 --> 24:06.746
Oy.
( groans ):
Ah!

24:07.714 --> 24:09.115
Diffuse brain edema.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.050
Facial CT shows a
LeFort Two fracture.
Okay.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.251
What does that mean?

24:12.251 --> 24:14.086
He's going to need
surgeries to fix

24:14.086 --> 24:16.155
the bones
in his face.
I'll put him
back on monitors.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.590
And set up
for a formal trake.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.125
What's that-- trake?

24:19.125 --> 24:21.027
We need to put
a surgical airway
in his neck.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.530
All right,
we're going to need
12 of decadron I.V. push

24:23.530 --> 24:25.164
and 60 of mannitol.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.999
KOVAC:
Number eight sterile gloves.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.801
PRATT:
Betadine and steri-drape.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.069
KOVAC:
One per cent with epi.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.872
CT report.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.240
KOVAC:
Okay.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.575
Norma, you need anything?

24:35.575 --> 24:37.043
Ten blade to Dr. Pratt.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.612
Um, my husband...
we're separated.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.547
Uh, did anybody...

24:40.547 --> 24:41.748
Yes, he's been called.

24:41.748 --> 24:46.185
Do you, uh...
do you have a washroom?

24:46.185 --> 24:47.987
Uh, Chuny, I'll get that.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.188
Why don't you show Mrs. Beckwith
where that is, okay?

24:49.188 --> 24:50.089
Vertical incision?
Okay.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.691
Come with me, ma'am.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.560
I'll bring you back
when they're done, okay?

24:53.560 --> 24:56.062
Three centimeters from
the cricoid cartilage
to sternal notch.

24:56.062 --> 24:59.065
I'm glad you found time
to supervise your resident.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.100
Cauterize here
for the hemostasis.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.069
There's no excuse
for what happened earlier.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.203
I was with another patient.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.304
That woman was
less critical.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.305
Not by my assessment.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.874
Then your assessment was wrong.

25:07.874 --> 25:08.808
Ready to divide
the thyroid isthmus.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.176
Two kellys.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.045
A kid with severe head trauma
takes priority.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.747
You shouldn't need a nurse
to tell you that.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.583
And you shouldn't need a doctor
to explain to you

25:16.583 --> 25:18.918
that it's not always clear
who the most critical is.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.687
Then I suggest next time
you call in a second attending

25:20.687 --> 25:22.655
or you get
a more senior resident.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.923
Hey, I'm an R4, all right?
I thought I had it.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.592
Perhaps you and I
need to have a talk

25:25.592 --> 25:27.193
in private
about which nurses

25:27.193 --> 25:28.795
you're willing to work with
and which ones you're not.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.997
That way, this
won't have to
happen again.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.604
Number six shiley.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.074
RASGOTRA:
It's hard to come up
with the right thing.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.076
Are people sending Michael
loser presents?

25:44.076 --> 25:45.978
Well, Pratt thinks
he can send him a pizza.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.046
And Chuny got him these.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.048
But I meant from me.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.249
Well, what's
your current plan?

25:50.249 --> 25:52.619
Well, I wrote him
a poem.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.655
Are you sure
you want me to...

25:55.655 --> 25:56.989
Hmm.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.090
Scented.

26:05.632 --> 26:08.067
It rhymes.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.168
Is it too high school?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.269
Yeah, it's kind of
cheesy.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.170
I'm an idiot.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.639
No, you're not.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.708
Look... you're
his girlfriend, right?

26:15.708 --> 26:17.109
Well, I... I guess.
Yeah.

26:17.109 --> 26:21.180
Well, Neela, a man at war
has certain needs.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.982
You're beginning
to sound like Frank.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.250
I get that a lot.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.118
Meet me in the family room
in ten minutes.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.121
Dr. Kovac...

26:29.121 --> 26:30.389
I'm tired of
fighting with you.

26:30.389 --> 26:31.758
Give it a rest today.
Look, if there's

26:31.758 --> 26:33.292
an issue between
you and that nurse...

26:33.292 --> 26:34.861
It's my job to assess
where I'm needed.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.062
I understand that.
Yeah, and as

26:36.062 --> 26:37.730
for me and Sam,
we're a couple.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.966
I mean, it's...
it's not a problem.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.001
All right, then.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.704
Look, normally, I try
to resolve internal issues

26:44.704 --> 26:47.907
as... as calmly,
as civilly as possible.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.842
And you probably
don't understand that

26:49.842 --> 26:52.411
because in this case...
well, I didn't.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.948
Look, from now on,
I'm just going to
focus my attention

26:55.948 --> 27:00.219
on determining how the nurses
should be utilized.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.821
That sounds good.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.195
Nice.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.863
Don't be so serious.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.431
Try to relax
a little bit.

27:12.431 --> 27:13.432
Have some fun.

27:13.432 --> 27:14.801
This feels too weird.

27:14.801 --> 27:15.935
It's okay, it'll be fine.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.036
Come on.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.808
( chuckles )

27:21.808 --> 27:24.043
Oh, grab those lollipops.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.978
You're kidding, right?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.914
No. Come on.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.021
This guy's asking
for you again.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.890
Secret of my success, Chuny--
always leave them wanting more.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.759
Done. Done.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.093
Dead.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.295
And... done.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.032
LOCKHART:
Smile.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.734
( shutter clicks )

27:47.734 --> 27:48.968
Nice.

27:48.968 --> 27:49.969
Ready?

27:49.969 --> 27:51.103
( shutter clicks )

27:51.103 --> 27:52.371
Great.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.773
( laughs )

27:53.773 --> 27:55.207
Okay. Smile.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.009
( shutter clicks )

27:57.009 --> 27:58.010
That's nice.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.812
( shutter clicks )

27:59.812 --> 28:01.180
Do my legs look okay?

28:01.180 --> 28:03.816
Yes. You have the gams
of a patriot.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.952
Now make love to the camera.

28:07.119 --> 28:07.954
That's great.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.922
Excellent.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.859
Smile.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.293
( camera shutter clicks )

28:14.293 --> 28:15.795
Perfect.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.263
( groans )

28:17.263 --> 28:19.131
Hi.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.367
Thank you.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.401
Where's your roller-date?

28:22.401 --> 28:24.070
Lou?

28:24.070 --> 28:27.039
He said he'd come back
with pizza and Snickers.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.440
Seems like a sweet guy.

28:29.909 --> 28:34.080
So, your lead levels
came back critical.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.048
Is that from
my treatments?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.084
It's probably from the
herbs you were taking.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.952
You're going to need
a series of injections,

28:39.952 --> 28:42.254
but the anemia
should resolve.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.824
Um, more importantly

28:44.824 --> 28:48.160
is, uh, what you're
doing about the BRCA.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.162
What I'm doing?

28:50.162 --> 28:52.832
Yeah. Can you hold onto
this for a minute?

28:54.133 --> 28:56.869
If you like, I could
get an oncologist

28:56.869 --> 28:58.871
to come down here
and talk to you.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.406
No. I don't want that.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.843
You okay?

29:03.843 --> 29:08.314
I saw an oncologist
when I first found out.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.149
And, um...

29:10.149 --> 29:12.919
what made you
get tested?

29:12.919 --> 29:16.022
My doctor recommended it,
on account of my mother.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.357
Is she positive, too?

29:18.357 --> 29:21.327
She beat cancer once
when I was little,

29:21.327 --> 29:24.263
but it came back
to get her.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.833
I watched her getting smaller
and smaller all winter.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.168
And then, as soon as the
leaves began to go green,

29:29.168 --> 29:31.137
she passed away.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.139
It was right before
my senior prom.

29:33.139 --> 29:36.042
She was 44 years old.

29:36.042 --> 29:39.078
I'm sorry.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.081
Did the oncologist
you spoke with

29:42.081 --> 29:44.851
mention anything about
prophylactic surgery?

29:44.851 --> 29:46.052
You mean having
my breasts removed?

29:46.052 --> 29:47.319
And an oophorectomy.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.121
I'd never do that.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.258
That's why
I tried Mexico.

29:52.258 --> 29:55.061
I want to... I want
to fall in love.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.529
I want to have
a child, a family...

29:57.529 --> 29:59.966
while there's still time.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.901
Well, then, you might
want to consider

30:01.901 --> 30:03.870
just the mastectomies
and wait for the ovarian...

30:03.870 --> 30:05.271
"Just the mastectomies"?

30:05.271 --> 30:08.174
Would a man even want
to look at me then?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.977
There have been
a lot of advances

30:10.977 --> 30:12.144
in reconstructive surgery

30:12.144 --> 30:13.946
and you need
to protect yourself.

30:16.248 --> 30:20.486
Can you promise me that giving
up my breasts would protect me?

30:20.486 --> 30:24.156
It would decrease your chance
of getting cancer by 90%.

30:24.156 --> 30:27.393
And I would lose months
of my life to recovery

30:27.393 --> 30:28.995
with no guarantees.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.563
And the clock
is ticking, you know.

30:31.563 --> 30:35.267
I'm not getting
any younger.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.904
Tell me which poison to pick...

30:39.371 --> 30:43.142
...the cancer risk
or the surgery.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.313
Well, I can't.

30:47.313 --> 30:51.283
But maybe an oncologist could.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.189
Mr. Beckwith?

30:57.189 --> 30:58.290
Are you Doctor, uh...

30:58.290 --> 30:59.658
Kovac. Yeah.
Please, come with me.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.427
Where... where is he?
Can I see him now?

31:01.427 --> 31:03.963
Uh, I'd like to talk to you
about his condition first.

31:03.963 --> 31:04.964
Is my wife here?

31:04.964 --> 31:06.232
She's in with Robbie now.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.566
Oh, is he awake?
I want to see him.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.201
You will, soon.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.970
I told her not to
get him that thing.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.538
She's always making me
out to be the bad guy,

31:12.538 --> 31:14.106
spoiling that kid rotten.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.608
Why don't we go inside
so I can explain to you

31:16.608 --> 31:18.677
where we are at
with Robbie now.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.347
I'm not going in there.
I know why you
take people in there.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.682
Sir, please...
No, my boy is not dead!

31:23.682 --> 31:26.118
Robbie!

31:26.118 --> 31:26.552
Mr. Beckwith.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.254
Robbie!

31:28.254 --> 31:29.421
Where is he?
Sir, please.

31:29.421 --> 31:30.522
Sir, can you just
calm down?

31:30.522 --> 31:31.523
Where is he?
Sir...

31:31.523 --> 31:33.125
Robbie! Robbie!

31:33.125 --> 31:34.493
Robbie!

31:34.493 --> 31:35.962
KOVAC:
Mr. Beckwith!

31:46.338 --> 31:48.107
There's a swelling in his brain.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.508
We hope it's going
to go down soon.

31:52.411 --> 31:57.616
We had to put an emergency
airway in his neck.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.989
What did you...?

32:02.989 --> 32:06.292
What did you do?
What did you do?

32:09.295 --> 32:10.429
( sobbing softly ):
I'm sorry, Jack.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.031
I'm sorry.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.603
( screaming )
No! No!

32:20.206 --> 32:21.273
Security!

32:21.273 --> 32:24.243
( yelling )

32:24.243 --> 32:25.377
Stop it!

32:27.346 --> 32:28.347
Stop it!

32:28.347 --> 32:32.351
( yelling )

32:32.351 --> 32:33.485
Oh, God!

32:36.188 --> 32:37.689
( grunting )
Stop!

32:39.225 --> 32:42.394
NORMA:
Jack...

32:42.394 --> 32:43.729
( sobbing )

32:48.234 --> 32:49.201
Stop.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.088
I didn't want that floor
to be without an attending.

33:09.088 --> 33:12.058
It's all right.
My shift starts in
35 minutes, anyway.

33:12.058 --> 33:12.791
Your shift?
Yep.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.393
Until we get new faculty,

33:14.393 --> 33:17.363
it's just you, me
and the moonlighters.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.331
Hey, Doc. Wife doesn't
want to press charges.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.100
How about you?

33:21.100 --> 33:25.171
No. When she leaves the room,
let him go inside, see his son.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.073
Hey, uh, the burn victim
who went up to ICU,
how's he doing?

33:27.073 --> 33:29.175
He's hanging in there,
last I checked.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.577
The guy's such a
mess, he can't even
tell us his name.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.279
How you doing?

33:33.279 --> 33:36.082
That floor came out
of nowhere.

33:36.082 --> 33:38.284
Hey, I signed
out to Morris.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.385
He's our mini-
chief, right?

33:39.385 --> 33:40.619
Just go.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.222
Neela, you el-train-bound?
In a minute.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.656
All right.
I'll walk out with you.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.094
What are you doing?

33:48.094 --> 33:49.228
Found it in sutures.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.097
It was wrapped in
a death kit shroud.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.198
It's kind of soggy.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.665
Frank, that was
for Gallant.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.334
Oh. Hey, try
Lou Malnati's.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.602
They overnight.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.204
So, uh, Neela...

33:58.204 --> 34:00.172
I feel you should know
that I minored in photography.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.740
So, if there's anything
you ever need a hand with...

34:01.740 --> 34:03.109
Shut up, Morris.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.476
What's he talking about?
Nothing.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.811
Okay, different tack:

34:05.811 --> 34:07.679
As chief resident,
I think I need to know

34:07.679 --> 34:10.149
what you and Abby were doing
in that room on company time.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.817
And by "know,"
I mean see.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.219
You know what, Morris?

34:14.219 --> 34:16.188
Just because you're so cute.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.525
( chuckles )

34:19.525 --> 34:21.527
Sebaceous cyst abscess.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.395
On somebody's ass.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.563
Oh, it's my fat guy
in Curtain Two.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.400
Weighing in at
an easy 400 pounds.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.168
Sheesh!
Looks like it's
leaking, Morris.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.803
You might want
to check that out.

34:31.803 --> 34:34.273
( groans )

34:36.408 --> 34:38.244
I won't have to sleep up here,
will I?

34:38.244 --> 34:40.346
No. We have a bed for you
on the third floor.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.217
We both know what
they're going to say.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.556
The safest thing would be for me
to have the double mastectomy.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.558
Well, I know it's a sacrifice,
but it's not as though

34:52.558 --> 34:55.594
you'd have to live without
breasts forever.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.464
It won't be the same.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.367
It won't feel like my body.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.868
Well, the things
you want

35:02.868 --> 35:06.272
you can't have
if you get cancer.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.840
So, if you were me, you'd do it.

35:14.180 --> 35:18.384
Well, sometimes, we want life
to stay the same,

35:18.384 --> 35:20.252
but it doesn't-- it changes.

35:20.252 --> 35:24.556
And if I were you, I hope I
would be brave enough to change.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.394
Hi, Abby.
Is this Miss Lowenstein?

35:28.394 --> 35:29.661
Yes, it is.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.364
Dr. Geary can
see you now.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.200
I'll check on you tomorrow.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.801
Thanks.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.378
Someone picking you up?

36:19.378 --> 36:23.315
Erica's dropping off Alex.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.585
Heard you had a little
throw-down with a patient.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.420
Uh, not a patient.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.588
The scooter kid's father.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.491
Oh, Robbie.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.260
He's having some purposeful
movements.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.627
Yeah.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.364
More than I can say
for myself today.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.303
I shouldn't have left him.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.939
It was the wrong thing
for the wrong reason.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.476
We'll figure it out.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.411
Yeah.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.480
Let's start again tomorrow, huh?

36:59.651 --> 37:04.356
Tell Alex I'll be seeing him
for that soccer game tomorrow.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.792
He's going to be
real happy.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.967
Hey.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.536
So, you off?

37:17.536 --> 37:18.437
No, coffee.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.471
I got six more hours.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.006
Hey, walk with me.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.542
Okay.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.010
Something wrong?

37:25.010 --> 37:28.580
You're sleeping with him.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.848
I was.

37:29.848 --> 37:30.982
It's over.

37:30.982 --> 37:34.019
It's never over, hon.
Trust me.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.425
So I don't think
it's appropriate

37:39.425 --> 37:40.959
for the two of you
to work together.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.728
What?
And since I
can't control

37:42.728 --> 37:44.696
physician shifts,
I guess I got to rejigger yours.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.398
Rejigger?

37:46.398 --> 37:47.666
I took a look at
the schedule, and...

37:47.666 --> 37:49.067
Whoa, come on.
Wait a minute.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.602
It seems to work out
if you work

37:50.602 --> 37:52.070
Tuesday and Friday nights

37:52.070 --> 37:54.340
and pick up a third shift
Saturday or Sunday.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.907
That's two less
than I'm already doing,

37:55.907 --> 37:57.876
which I can't afford
and I'll never see my kid.

37:57.876 --> 37:58.910
I'm doing you a favor.

37:58.910 --> 37:59.945
It doesn't sound like it.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.347
Well, I could do
what any other

38:01.347 --> 38:02.881
manager would do.
How do you feel

38:02.881 --> 38:05.417
about I.C.U. or Recovery?
Geriatrics always

38:05.417 --> 38:07.085
has openings.
You're threatening
to transfer me?

38:07.085 --> 38:09.455
I am giving you a choice.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.989
Well, I'm an E.R. nurse.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.591
Right.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.561
So be here Friday, 8:00 p.m.,
ready to work.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.868
Hey.
Don't you have work?

38:22.868 --> 38:24.736
Nope. 48 hours off.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.672
Oh, lucky you.
Yeah.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.006
Thanks.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.376
Oh, there's more
in the fridge.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.378
Well, who's the
other one for?

38:32.378 --> 38:33.912
Having a sleep-over.

38:42.488 --> 38:45.391
Hi. I ordered a Caesar salad
and a root beer.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.459
It should be right out.
Thanks.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.802
Hey, sailor.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.137
New in town?

38:59.137 --> 39:00.706
Have a seat.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.409
No, I have to get going.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.615
I took our BRCA lady
up to oncology.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.483
Yeah?

39:11.483 --> 39:13.419
It was sad.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.120
She was telling me

39:15.120 --> 39:19.525
how she's at this
point in her life

39:19.525 --> 39:23.629
where she's worried that
some of things she wants

39:23.629 --> 39:26.598
she's never going to have.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.733
She could never

39:27.733 --> 39:30.802
imagine
feeling that way...

39:30.802 --> 39:32.804
Sad.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.950
You must miss it.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.921
Drinking.

39:49.921 --> 39:52.057
Wow.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.059
You'd be a terrible sponsor.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.696
Yeah, I could never give up.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.465
I'd miss it too much.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.602
Well, you might
want to think

40:03.602 --> 40:05.971
about suspending it
for the evening.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.773
Mm. Need a ride home?

40:07.773 --> 40:09.708
No, but I think you do.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.909
I do?
Mm-hmm.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.945
You're not driving like this.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.982
I'm not?
No.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.432
( rhythmic thumping )

40:38.203 --> 40:42.474
Ray!
I can't concentrate!

40:42.474 --> 40:44.042
( thumping stops )

40:52.150 --> 40:54.686
( thumping resumes )

41:06.164 --> 41:08.033
Help yourself to something.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.868
Wow.

41:09.868 --> 41:13.104
Didn't take you
long to embrace
the bachelor lifestyle.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.172
No.

41:14.172 --> 41:17.175
It's like riding a horse.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.210
Or living in a barn.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.547
Can't get him
out of my head.

41:21.547 --> 41:22.648
Who?

41:25.150 --> 41:27.118
That guy.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.056
What a mess.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.562
All melted flesh.

41:36.562 --> 41:40.732
But even so, enough will
to keep walking.

41:40.732 --> 41:45.170
Body ruined, but still,
desperate to live.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.242
And he's alive.

41:51.242 --> 41:55.080
( TV starts )

41:55.080 --> 41:57.048
Yeah, I wonder, if I...

41:59.685 --> 42:02.921
If I were hurt like that...

42:05.323 --> 42:07.626
If you'd keep on walking?

42:07.626 --> 42:11.897
If...
if anyone would know who I was.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.901
I would.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.172
Probably.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.216
You know, you might want
to think about

42:31.216 --> 42:34.152
getting a housekeeper.

42:34.152 --> 42:36.087
'Cause it's really
disgusting in here.

42:36.087 --> 42:40.091
In a charming sort
of way, of course.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.060
You want a coffee?

42:46.632 --> 42:51.169
Probably don't want a coffee,
but I got you black coffee.

42:51.169 --> 42:52.804
MAN ( on TV ):
I want everybody

42:52.804 --> 42:55.140
to have plenty of those.

43:09.888 --> 43:13.191
( indistinct voices over TV )

43:16.662 --> 43:18.730
MAN:
He'll be here any damn minute.

43:18.730 --> 43:21.266
I think Sam's right.
We ought to.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.267
Yeah.

43:22.267 --> 43:24.235
What about after?

43:25.336 --> 43:27.205
What about after we do it?

43:27.205 --> 43:28.139
Hmm?

43:28.139 --> 43:29.741
What do we do then?

43:31.309 --> 43:34.112
Then you live with it.
