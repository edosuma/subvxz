WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.040
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.960
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!

00:15.960 --> 00:19.000
# She's Mrs Brown

00:19.000 --> 00:22.320
# That's Mrs Brown

00:22.320 --> 00:25.000
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

00:25.600 --> 00:28.240
It's going to be a very
fancy wedding, Dermot.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.760
I know. I wish they'd picked
somewhere else. It's too fancy.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.800
Here, Auntie Mary
and Tommy the sprinter's coming.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.520
We'd better make sure this
place has a disabled entrance.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.720
He has only one leg.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.440
It's the Ritz Crown Hotel, Mammy.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.680
It has everything.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.200
Annie Gibney is coming.
She's an alcoholic.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.720
We'd better make sure it
has a disabled exit as well.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.280
Your Uncle Gonzo rang.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.040
He wanted to know what
"morning wear" was.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.400
I told him
just to come in his pyjamas.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.920
That's what I mean, too fancy.
A seven course meal, Mammy.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.720
It'll be nice, Dermot.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.680
Mammy, there are people dying
of starvation in the world.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.400
Fine, what's their names?
I'll put them on the list.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.040
Just forget it. Mrs Nicholson needs
to know how many are coming

01:16.040 --> 01:18.080
from our side by the end of the day.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.720
Well, with Cathy and Mick...

01:19.720 --> 01:23.000
Mick's not coming. He has to work.
He can get off for a wedding.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.880
He's not coming. End of discussion.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.120
Well, with Cathy dumped,
that means... 43.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.840
Oh, are you bringing a
girl to the wedding, Rory?

01:31.840 --> 01:34.680
Well, I was going to
invite Dino from work.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.560
Oh, lovely! You'll probably
both be bringing girls.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.360
I'll put it down as 46!

01:40.360 --> 01:42.680
Well. Mammy... Not now, Rory.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.440
Right, Mammy, will you ring Maria's
mother and let her know today?
I will.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.240
That way, I can go to the stag party
with me head clear.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.000
And we can go to
the hen party with our head clear.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.240
How are you, Winnie?

01:54.240 --> 01:56.640
Cup of tea, love? Ah, no, love.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.360
I'm heading down to
hospital to visit Jacko.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.080
And I'm bringing him home this week.
Again?

02:02.080 --> 02:05.680
Well, Dermot, are you all set
for the big day? More or less.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.240
Fancy hotel and all, eh?

02:08.240 --> 02:11.000
Your father would be very
proud of you. Lord rest him.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.880
Yeah, whatever.

02:12.880 --> 02:17.840
I'll never forget what my father
said to me the first time I went
to prison. What did he say?

02:17.840 --> 02:20.480
Hello, son.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.760
Come on, you. Let's pick up the
suits. I have to get to work.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.760
Hang on, Dermot,
I'll take a lift with you.

02:26.760 --> 02:30.240
Mammy? Yes, love? If you get a
chance, can I have a chat with you?

02:30.240 --> 02:31.760
You can have a chat now if you like.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.960
No. Later, just you and me.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.640
All right, love. See you later.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.840
Mammy, you should give
the hen party a miss.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.440
It's going to be all,
you know, young people.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.320
Cathy, you're only as young as
you feel, and me and Winnie

02:47.320 --> 02:49.520
feel like two
cocker spaniels in heat.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.760
Woof, woof!

02:53.400 --> 02:56.440
OK, you are not invited.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.640
You're too old for hen
parties, so you're not invited.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.440
Are you happy now
you got me to say it?

03:02.440 --> 03:05.720
It's a hen party for young people.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.560
It's embarrassing watching old
women pretending to be teenagers!

03:09.560 --> 03:11.240
You leave Winnie alone!

03:11.240 --> 03:13.840
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

03:13.840 --> 03:16.160
There's Grandad banging down again.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.280
Is there anybody down there?

03:18.280 --> 03:19.840
Mammy?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.360
No!

03:22.360 --> 03:26.320
Who's that, then?
Polly the fuckin' parrot.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.760
Now, go to sleep.
Me hot water bottle is leaking.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.120
What did he say?
His hot water bottle is leaking.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.600
He doesn't have a hot
water bottle, Mammy!

03:39.240 --> 03:41.360
Cathy, go up and see
what he wants, will you?

03:41.360 --> 03:43.200
I'll get our clean sheets.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.880
Never mind clean sheets,
get a fookin' lifeboat.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.360
That's the first time, you know.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.480
First time I've been told that
I'm too old for something.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.680
The cheek of her!

03:55.680 --> 03:58.320
I think it's all right to
pretend to be a teenager,

03:58.320 --> 04:00.000
or anything else you want to be.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.240
He's grand. Not yet, Winnie. Jesus!

04:05.480 --> 04:09.800
I mean, after all, God knows
you're an adult for long enough.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.880
I think you should stay as young
as you can for as long as you can.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.160
OK, Winnie.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.600
He's grand. Cathy sorted him out.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.480
We're going to that hen party.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.760
Agnes, you heard what Cathy said.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.400
We're not invited.
Cathy is not the boss of us.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.120
Now, listen,
we have to find out where it is,

04:34.120 --> 04:36.560
and we're going to crash it.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.960
I'll show them how to party!

04:57.440 --> 04:59.680
I thought they were extinct.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.080
We're home, Mammy.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.920
Hello, Cathy. Hello, Betty.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.120
Well, you two have been busy.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.120
I'm exhausted, but it was worth it.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.440
I got me dress for the wedding. Oh,
give us a look at it. Where's Maria?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.800
At home at her mother's.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.880
We just came from there.
We had tea on the patio. Patio?

05:19.880 --> 05:21.080
Excuse me!

05:21.080 --> 05:24.680
Rory and Dino were there, going
over the hairstyles for the big day.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.760
That's nice. Da-da!

05:27.520 --> 05:31.600
Is Ann Summers selling
off their old stock?

05:31.600 --> 05:34.160
No, Mammy, it's me dress for
the wedding! What do you think?

05:34.160 --> 05:35.880
It's very feckin'...

05:35.880 --> 05:38.560
what's the word I'm looking for?

05:38.560 --> 05:41.280
Classy. Red!

05:41.280 --> 05:42.880
It's supposed to be red.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.520
Is it supposed to be slapper red?

05:45.520 --> 05:47.800
Ah, Mammy! Let me look at it again.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.160
I didn't really see it.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.120
Turn around.
Not you, the feckin' dress!

05:56.080 --> 06:00.120
I suppose it will be fine.
I better put it away upstairs.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.480
Do, Cathy, and hide it.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.480
I'm telling you, if word
gets out that that's here,

06:05.480 --> 06:08.160
we'll be broken into.
By the fashion police.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.200
I'll see you tomorrow night, Betty -
for the hen party!

06:11.200 --> 06:14.800
Right, Cathy. Are you looking
forward to the hen party, Betty?

06:14.800 --> 06:17.720
Aye, it should be great craic.
It should be great craic!

06:17.720 --> 06:20.200
I haven't been to that place
in years. What do you call it?

06:20.200 --> 06:21.720
The hairdresser's?

06:23.280 --> 06:27.520
Very funny! Cathy says
you're barred from the hen
party, so you may give up.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.040
Nobody's going to
tell you where it is.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.640
Fine, but if you're really her
friend, you won't let her

06:32.640 --> 06:35.480
go to the wedding in that feckin'
dress! Why not? It's lovely.

06:35.480 --> 06:40.440
Lovely? She puts that on, you're
only waiting for her to go
"ten dollar, me love you long time!"

06:43.200 --> 06:48.520
No, she won't.
You're just out of touch
with fashion. I know fashion, love.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.440
I love that coat on you, and I
have done for the last five years.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.560
Every time I see it, I think "I must
put the black bags out tonight".

06:56.920 --> 06:59.760
Good luck! Hiya, boys.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.880
Hiya, Betty. Here's the groom!

07:01.880 --> 07:03.720
Hello, son.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.600
Don't even feckin' think about it.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.680
Cathy and Betty were just down in
Maria's house.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.560
Tea on the patio.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.480
They said it's a nice house.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.440
When you walk into the hall,

07:17.440 --> 07:20.960
on the ceiling there's a
big...what do ya call it?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.960
A night vision camera?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.840
Crystal chandelier!

07:24.840 --> 07:28.400
And to get to the patio,
you go through the dining room.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.000
Past the motion sensors.
Exactly! How do you know?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.920
It must be a big house. Big enough.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.960
And they have two toilets.
One upstairs and one downstairs.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.200
Two toilets? For what?

07:42.200 --> 07:44.440
What do they do, get up
in the morning and go

07:44.440 --> 07:46.040
"Oh, where will I shit today?"

07:49.640 --> 07:51.760
They only have the one arse.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.120
Mind you, a toilet downstairs, eh?

07:56.120 --> 07:59.000
I'd say it'd be feckin' handy.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.520
Here you go, love. Thanks, Ma.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.080
What's this?
A wedding present from Buster.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.600
Oh, nice.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.080
A VDV player? How can you
afford things like that, Buster?

08:14.080 --> 08:18.120
I know a fella who does them cheap.
Why does he cut the plug off?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.720
Right, well, I'm off.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.240
I'll see you tomorrow
for the stag party. See you, Buster.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.360
Oh!

08:28.200 --> 08:29.320
The cheek of him!

08:29.320 --> 08:33.440
Dermot, just cos she has a big
house, doesn't make it a home. True.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.160
And I'd say that's her, you know.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.840
Big house, no home.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.880
Yeah, fur coat, no knickers!

08:39.880 --> 08:43.080
She's like
a prostitute on her night off. What?

08:43.080 --> 08:46.400
All dressed up and no-one to blow!

08:51.440 --> 08:53.440
Is that funny, Dermot?

08:53.440 --> 08:56.000
Yeah, Ma. I don't feckin' get it.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.280
I read that in one
of your magazines.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.040
Dermot, what's a blow job?

09:04.040 --> 09:06.080
20 quid, Ma.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.880
I thought 20 quid was a score?

09:13.400 --> 09:16.560
They change the feckin'
language every day now.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.200
Dermot, where are yous having the
stag party? In Foley's, I suppose?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.640
No. We're not going near Foley's.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.600
Mark said Betty is meeting Cathy and
Barbara there for the hen party,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.160
and we don't want to bump into them.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.960
The hen party is in Foley's!

09:43.200 --> 09:45.120
That's perfect! Perfect!

09:46.200 --> 09:50.640
How long does it take you to fit it,
Mr O'Connor? Usually,
we're in and out in a day. A day?

09:50.640 --> 09:53.280
Could you do it tomorrow?
Oh, no. I'm far too busy.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.120
I'll make it worth your while.
I'll give you an extra blow job.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.840
Where do you want it fitted?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.360
Here! Here!

10:04.840 --> 10:07.960
Oh, wait, there's
a chip gone out of this.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.400
Somebody must have shit
a brick. Are you sure?

10:11.400 --> 10:14.960
I'm positive! But look,
you won't be able to, like...

10:14.960 --> 10:18.640
You worry about the fittin'.
I'll worry about the shittin'!

10:22.000 --> 10:25.080
I'll see you tomorrrow,
Mr O'Connell. And if there's
anybody that'll

10:25.080 --> 10:26.840
help you fit it, bring them along.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.320
There's a blow job in
it for them as well.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.880
Thanks, Barbara!
Aye, cheers, Barbara!

10:39.200 --> 10:40.800
Ah, for Christ's sake!

10:45.240 --> 10:47.640
You all set for the party, girls?

10:47.640 --> 10:51.720
For God's sake, Mrs McGoogan, you
were told that yous weren't invited!

10:51.720 --> 10:54.520
Well, we're here now,
so live with it.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.960
Jesus, I don't know half the
people here. Where's Maria?

10:58.960 --> 11:00.920
Winnie, this is not the hen party.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.280
The hen party is in a nightclub.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.880
So what's all this, then?

11:04.880 --> 11:07.640
It's the funeral
party for Mr Murphy.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.040
Oh, good God, no!

11:10.040 --> 11:12.160
# Sex bomb, sex bomb

11:12.160 --> 11:13.920
# You're my sex bomb

11:13.920 --> 11:15.360
# You can really do it

11:15.360 --> 11:16.960
# when I want to come along

11:16.960 --> 11:18.600
# Sex bomb, sex bomb

11:18.600 --> 11:19.880
# you're my sex bomb

11:19.880 --> 11:22.800
# You can really turn me on

11:23.760 --> 11:26.000
# You can really turn me on! #

11:27.080 --> 11:30.600
Agnes,
this is Paddy Murphy's funeral!

11:32.200 --> 11:35.000
Lovely man. I always liked him.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.560
Winnie, come on!

11:43.800 --> 11:47.280
No, no. No, that's an awful feckin'
smell. Smell, smell!

11:47.280 --> 11:50.120
It's gas, missus! You have a leak.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.400
It's only slight, but I'd have
it checked out all the same.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.000
Here, give yer man a shout.
He'll sort you out.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.560
I will, Mr O'Connell.
Thanks very much for coming over.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.080
No problem. Oh, hold on.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.800
I nearly forgot. Your blow job!

12:02.800 --> 12:05.920
Ah, no. No, thanks. Good luck!

12:05.920 --> 12:07.320
Suit yourself.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.960
Mammy?

12:11.960 --> 12:15.200
Yes, love? Would now be a good
time to have a chat with you?

12:15.200 --> 12:19.120
Well, go up and get dressed,
and I'll talk to you
before you go to work.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.760
Ah, now, here's Venus and Serena.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.640
Morning, Mammy. Good morning, son.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.920
Morning, Mammy.
Don't "good morning, Mammy" me,

12:26.920 --> 12:29.560
Buster Brady. The carry on
of you in this house last night.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.280
How dare you bring a woman
back to this house? A woman?

12:32.280 --> 12:34.240
I got a chick last night. A chick?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.440
She was in my class in school!

12:39.640 --> 12:42.680
I nearly died when I came
down and saw her sitting there.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.360
"Hello, Agnes."

12:44.360 --> 12:46.280
"Hello, teacher".

12:50.440 --> 12:52.520
Do you want breakfast?

12:52.520 --> 12:54.040
Just a cup of tea, Mammy.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.720
Are you in there? Yes!

13:02.720 --> 13:05.320
Mammy, you need to know.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.880
I'm gay.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.800
I love Dino, and I
want the world to know.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.880
Are you upset?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.840
RETCHING

13:17.200 --> 13:22.240
Oh, Mammy, I knew you'd take
it hard, but please try
to think of my happiness.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.680
RETCHING

13:25.800 --> 13:27.440
Oh, Mammy!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.560
How can I be happy?

13:29.560 --> 13:30.960
Please try to think of me!

13:30.960 --> 13:34.720
Well, you can get off the feckin'
floor for starters! Aaaagh! Aaaah!

13:38.760 --> 13:41.120
What is wrong with you?

13:41.120 --> 13:43.840
Mammy,
I need to come out of the closet!

13:43.840 --> 13:48.000
You'll have to wait until
Buster's finished to go in first!

13:48.000 --> 13:49.600
Rory!

13:49.600 --> 13:51.120
Rory, are you all right?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.480
What's wrong with him?
Diarrhoea, I think.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.800
Look at the head on you.
You had some to drink last night.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.000
Look who's talking!
You were as bad yourself.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I was, wasn't I!

14:06.000 --> 14:10.720
Here, I left me dick in the taxi.
Oh, no!

14:10.720 --> 14:15.360
There's a taxi going round Dublin
somewhere now with two pricks in it!

14:17.280 --> 14:19.880
Are you ringing her to cancel?

14:19.880 --> 14:25.800
What? You invited Mrs Nicholson
here to dinner on Friday night.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.040
Sweet lovin' St. Jude!

14:28.040 --> 14:33.680
What's wrong with Mammy? She only
invited your future mother-in-law to
dinner here Friday night. No way!

14:33.680 --> 14:36.080
Way! What am I going to
give her to eat, Dermot?

14:36.080 --> 14:39.480
You know better her than anyone.
What does she like to eat? I dunno.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.280
You can see her face, can't you?

14:41.280 --> 14:44.120
When I go
"I feel like chicken tonight".

14:46.120 --> 14:49.280
And her expecting something
fancy like tadpole's arseholes.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.960
Oh, what am I going to do?
I'll cook!

14:55.960 --> 14:58.360
Rory. I love you dearly son,

14:58.360 --> 15:02.480
but you're the only man I
know who can burn boiled eggs!

15:02.480 --> 15:04.960
Mammy, I'll get
Dino from work to help me.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.760
Dino from Wash and Blow? Dino was
a chef before he was a stylist.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.400
A chef! He's a Cordon Bleu!

15:10.400 --> 15:12.720
I couldn't give a shite what
colour he is,

15:12.720 --> 15:15.600
as long as he can
feckin' cook. We're getting a chef. 

15:15.600 --> 15:18.600
we're getting a feckin' chef!

15:18.600 --> 15:20.920
The last time I had a chef
in this house he put...

15:23.680 --> 15:25.360
It's none of your feckin' business!

15:35.240 --> 15:36.880
Mammy, go easy on the drink!

15:38.400 --> 15:42.760
I'm waiting for an hour for her
to ask me where the toilet is so
I can show off me new toilet.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.240
She's too posh to piss!

15:50.080 --> 15:54.320
All right Hillary? Well, actually.
I think I can smell gas.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.000
No. that's just him.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.480
How's your drink, Hillary?

15:59.480 --> 16:03.600
It tastes like cider. It is. Bulmers.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.320
I asked for champagne?
Well, you can fuck off!

16:10.720 --> 16:14.480
I'll just check with the lads
how the starters are coming.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.600
Do you need to go anywhere?

16:17.600 --> 16:20.960
Oh, no. no. thank you. I'm fine.

16:25.160 --> 16:29.320
Almost ready, Mrs B! Has she
asked to use the toilet yet? No.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.240
I do wish you wouldn't stare at me.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.400
I'll use it, Mrs B. What, Dino?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.480
The toilet. I'll use it.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.160
Ah, no, Dino I need her to get...

16:50.760 --> 16:52.640
You're right. it's a great idea.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.240
All you need to do is
ask me where it is!

16:58.160 --> 17:01.440
Just give me a second then come in.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.840
Nearly ready. The boys are just
finishing the Horses Doovers.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.760
Excuse me, Mrs Brown. Yes, Dino?

17:17.760 --> 17:21.080
Where is the toilet?
Oh. the toilet? Well,

17:21.080 --> 17:23.880
you could take your
pick of the two.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.080
The one upstairs or the on...

17:29.240 --> 17:31.320
the on sweety over there.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.760
Oh, that's handy.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.360
Yes, it is handy. Yes, it is.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.760
I'll use that one.
Whichever you like! Two.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.720
Psst!

17:42.720 --> 17:45.800
Excuse me a second.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.440
What? Mrs Brown, I'm too big!

17:50.440 --> 17:54.120
Oh, If I had a pound
for every man that said that.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.760
Watch me. Just watch.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.240
Mammy! What's wrong?

18:38.320 --> 18:40.720
Dino is wearing suspenders!

18:40.720 --> 18:42.560
Oh, Rory.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.520
I think he's a trans-testicle.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.480
Mammy, there's something I have to
tell you.

18:48.480 --> 18:52.120
Not now love. Just serve the meal.
But, Mammy... I'm in shock, love!

18:52.120 --> 18:53.680
Just serve the feckin' meal!

18:59.040 --> 19:01.760
I hope you flushed that!

19:01.760 --> 19:03.920
We're ready now.
if you'd like to shit up.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.720
Thank you, love. Oh,
this looks interesting. What is it?

19:14.720 --> 19:16.520
It's called soup.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.680
Oh, wait. wait. It's cold.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.720
Mine is cold.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.320
Hers is fuckin' cold!

19:26.320 --> 19:29.200
It's cold, Rory!

19:29.200 --> 19:32.280
Mammy. it's gazpacho.
It's supposed to be cold.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.400
Oh, don't be feckin' ridiculous.
Cold soup?!

19:36.400 --> 19:39.040
Take it back and tell Dino
to heat it up.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.280
Don't mind. Just take it back
and heat it up. Heat it up, Rory.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.160
I so sorry.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.080
I say, Agnes. Um.
what's for main course?

19:53.080 --> 19:54.240
Salmon.

19:55.200 --> 19:59.200
Oh, my favourite. Oh, good,
cos we're getting a whole tin each.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.880
I say Hillary.

20:06.880 --> 20:11.760
Hillary, I believe your
house was broken into? Yes, it was.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.360
Oh, how furking awful.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.120
Did the bisterds get anything?

20:15.120 --> 20:20.840
Sorry? The bisterds what
done the broking inning,

20:20.840 --> 20:23.760
did they get anything?

20:23.760 --> 20:25.800
Yes. yes. They got the forking DVD.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.440
DVD?

20:33.320 --> 20:37.720
The forking DVD?.
Ours is a Phillips.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.760
They're probably all the same you
know. they're probably all German.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.080
They just
put a different name on them.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.960
You can do anything with words,
that's what my husband used to say.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.160
He was great with words.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.680
If the children
were listening he'd spell them.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.120
You know, he'd say,

20:58.120 --> 21:01.360
"Agnes do you want to go
up S. T. I. A. R. S... "

21:01.360 --> 21:03.240
Ah! How nice!

21:03.240 --> 21:06.200
"..for a fuck?"

21:13.040 --> 21:15.600
It's hard...

21:15.600 --> 21:22.000
It's hard to think that there
were five people living har.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.160
Har?!

21:24.160 --> 21:26.040
What's fuckin' har?

21:28.240 --> 21:30.680
Well. yes. Heeyer in the house.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.600
Heeyer in the hayse?!

21:33.600 --> 21:35.600
HERE in the HOUSE!

21:39.000 --> 21:41.160
How do your teeth
not fuckin' fly out?

21:43.640 --> 21:46.560
No, Hillary.
You'd never take this five heeyer...

21:47.520 --> 21:49.720
And you wouldn' know why yee be.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.160
They could be anywah.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.680
Even in fuckin' cupboards.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.960
Excuse me a moment, please.

22:11.320 --> 22:14.080
Rory, I can't take this any more!
Mammy, what's wrong?

22:14.080 --> 22:16.240
Grandad is in the
cupboard havin' a shit!

22:18.320 --> 22:20.760
Rory, we need a plan.

22:20.760 --> 22:25.400
You get Grandad out of the cupboard
and put him into the toilet.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.200
I'll stop her from looking. Right.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.360
Dino. Yes? You stay fuckin' here.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.360
You can fuck off!

22:39.560 --> 22:41.280
Is everything all right?

22:41.280 --> 22:44.720
Yes, everything is beautiful, yes.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.560
Do you like to sing?

22:46.560 --> 22:48.800
To sing?!
# Oh, when the saints

22:48.800 --> 22:50.000
# Go marching in. #

22:50.000 --> 22:51.040
SING! SING!

22:51.040 --> 22:53.040
# Oh, when the saints
go marching in. #

22:53.040 --> 22:54.880
Rory, the fag. Get the fag.

22:54.880 --> 22:55.960
# I want to be. #

22:55.960 --> 22:58.000
You called, Mrs Brown?

22:58.000 --> 23:01.920
# Oh, when the saints go marching in

23:01.920 --> 23:03.360
# Oh, when the saints

23:03.360 --> 23:04.560
# Go marching in. #

23:04.560 --> 23:07.920
Hey, hey, hey!
We're finished all right.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.440
DOORBELL RINGS
Just drink. Rory, get the door.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.960
Have a drink!

23:13.960 --> 23:16.480
No. no. actually I've... Oh!
Have a fucking drink.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.120
Mrs Brown.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.000
Father Quinn!
Mrs Murphy is dreadfully upset about

23:24.000 --> 23:27.160
your cabaret performance
at her husband's funeral!

23:27.160 --> 23:29.640
Cabaret at a funeral?!

23:29.640 --> 23:30.800
No, it was a mistake.

23:30.800 --> 23:35.280
It was a hen party. We were having a
hen party. A hen party at a funeral!

23:35.280 --> 23:38.000
No, no. It was a mistake!
Oh, it was a mistake? Yes.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.400
The long boots
and the fishnet stockings?

23:40.400 --> 23:45.520
Fishnet stockings at a funeral?!
Will you shut the fuck up!

23:45.520 --> 23:49.320
Mrs Brown!
Mrs Murphy, it was a mistake!

23:49.320 --> 23:53.960
Look, if your husband had lived
another day, there'd be no problem.

23:53.960 --> 23:57.640
Mrs Brown, Rory has something
important he needs to tell you.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.160
Dino, I'm sure it's important. Not
now. She is very upset, Mrs Brown.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.000
Well, I just apologised Father.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.920
What do you want?
The burning at the stake?

24:04.920 --> 24:07.720
Mrs Brown, it really is important.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.120
Do I have your attention? Yes!

24:13.120 --> 24:14.680
I am in the middle of a crisis.

24:14.680 --> 24:18.040
I'm sure what you want to talk
about is important, but not NOW!

24:20.600 --> 24:22.680
Look Father, I never
meant to upset her.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.120
Well, I'm sure
you'll think of some way

24:25.120 --> 24:29.040
to make things up to Mrs Murphy.
I will, Father. Right.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.320
Mrs Brown...

24:32.320 --> 24:35.200
More drink, Hillary?

24:35.200 --> 24:36.240
Have a drink!

24:36.240 --> 24:39.920
Mammy, how could you?
He slipped, Rory. Dino come back!

24:39.920 --> 24:41.520
He slipped. You're a witness.

24:41.520 --> 24:45.920
He feckin' slipped! Rory.
Rory Brown get back!
He's gone out in that feckin' apron.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.480
People will think he's a sissy!

24:49.480 --> 24:52.320
That's all I need.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.240
Here's Maria.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.120
Hello. Hi, Mum. Get me out of here!

24:57.120 --> 24:59.760
This is a mad house!

25:00.800 --> 25:04.240
Maria, darling, why
wouldn't you listen to me?

25:04.240 --> 25:07.080
You cannot make a silk purse out of
a sow's ear.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.120
Come, Maria, we are going home.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.000
Maria!

25:12.560 --> 25:16.320
Mother, I am marrying Dermot Brown.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.040
I will be Maria Brown.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.200
I AM home!

25:20.200 --> 25:22.480
But these people are riff-raff!

25:23.320 --> 25:26.760
Oh, Mother! Maria.

25:26.760 --> 25:31.160
Riff raff? The reason why you
wouldn't recognise this, missus,

25:31.160 --> 25:33.160
is because this is a family.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.400
Something you would
know nothin' about.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.840
And that girl is your
daughter, she's not some
dog in a bloody dog show!

25:46.280 --> 25:51.920
Good girl, Betty. You took the
words right outta me feckin' mouth.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.240
And as for you, you
50 pence pole dancer.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.480
Is that the very best you can do? No.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.640
I feel sorry for the fuckin' pole.

26:02.480 --> 26:06.320
I'll have you know we are the most
respectable family on this street.

26:23.520 --> 26:30.200
Grandad's gone! I'm up here!

26:34.520 --> 26:38.440
Yes. Yes, I know.
Grandad? Oh, he's grand.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.040
Just a small headache.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.360
I just wanted to say
thanks, Betty, for last night.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.600
I was very proud of you.

26:48.600 --> 26:52.600
All right, love. Bye.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.040
That was Betty.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.040
So, Jacko didn't come home?

26:59.040 --> 27:02.240
No. He's got a broken collar bone
and his hip is out.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.200
More feckin' surgery. 
You must feel awful.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.880
I blame the hospital, Agnes.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.000
It was them that insisted I
push him in a wheelchair.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
I don't think they meant
you to use the escalator.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.640
Now I'll have to go to Dermot
and Maria's wedding on me own.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.720
No, you won't. you'll be with me.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.640
See you later, Agnes.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.680
What a week.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.040
Jacko in a heap at the
bottom of the escalator.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.520
Mrs Murphy upset by my little

27:33.520 --> 27:35.800
kiss-o-gram at her husband's funeral

27:37.360 --> 27:39.880
and Grandad shit a nuclear bomb.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.520
Isn't life a feckin' rollercoaster?

27:45.520 --> 27:47.960
Goodnight!

27:47.960 --> 27:49.720
# Say hello

27:52.200 --> 27:55.160
# To the queen of Dublin Town

27:55.160 --> 27:56.720
# As the best

27:56.720 --> 28:00.240
# mum of all she wears the crown

28:00.520 --> 28:04.480
# Mother Hen watching all her chicks

28:04.480 --> 28:07.680
# Sassy old lady full of tricks

28:07.680 --> 28:13.600
# It's a safe bet she'd never
let life get her down

28:13.600 --> 28:16.840
# She' Mrs Brown

28:16.840 --> 28:18.920
# That's Mrs Brown

28:18.920 --> 28:20.520
# Oh, Mrs Brown.
