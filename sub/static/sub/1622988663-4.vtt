WEBVTT

00:02.381 --> 00:03.342
Prudence, you have
gotta come outside!

00:03.422 --> 00:04.282
I've just seen
the biggest rock!

00:04.382 --> 00:05.804
- Oh!
- Oh, Zeke.

00:05.904 --> 00:07.765
Prudence, I'm so sorry.
I thought you were decent.

00:07.865 --> 00:10.607
Oh, it's okay.
They're just ankles.

00:10.707 --> 00:12.328
Wanna help me cool them off?

00:12.428 --> 00:14.290
Prudence,
you're a married woman.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.251
Come on, Zekey.

00:16.351 --> 00:17.733
Use that big Bible

00:17.833 --> 00:20.054
to cool off
my hot little ankles.

00:20.154 --> 00:23.457
[saxophone music plays]

00:23.557 --> 00:25.558
Like, um...

00:26.399 --> 00:27.980
Like this?

00:28.080 --> 00:29.661
Mmm, yeah, that's good.

00:29.761 --> 00:31.303
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

00:31.403 --> 00:33.824
- More.
- Your ankles are so bony.

00:33.924 --> 00:35.906
- [sighs]
- The bone really juts out.

00:36.006 --> 00:37.427
Faster.

00:37.527 --> 00:39.709
More. Oh, Zeke!

00:39.809 --> 00:41.630
- [man's voice] Zeke. Zeke.
- Zeke! Zeke!

00:41.730 --> 00:44.552
- Zeke. Wake up, man.
- [thunder rumbles]

00:44.652 --> 00:45.994
You were thrashing
around in your sleep.

00:46.094 --> 00:46.914
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:47.014 --> 00:49.236
I wasn't saying anything,
was I?

00:49.336 --> 00:50.637
Nope.

00:50.737 --> 00:53.239
Except you did say,
"I'm horny for ankles."

00:53.339 --> 00:54.600
That could mean
almost anything.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.701
- No, it can't.
- No, it can't.

00:57.222 --> 01:00.064
[theme song plays]

01:27.204 --> 01:28.825
[oxen mooing]

01:28.925 --> 01:30.667
Oh, I hate this leg
of the trip.

01:30.767 --> 01:31.988
Why did Thomas Jefferson

01:32.088 --> 01:33.989
have to buy
this shit piece of land?

01:34.089 --> 01:35.831
Please don't get started
on Thomas Jefferson again.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.392
- Well, he was a crook.
- Oh, here we go.

01:37.492 --> 01:38.673
Ah, they're all crooks.

01:38.773 --> 01:39.954
But the Whig party
on the other hand,

01:40.054 --> 01:41.795
now they're the party
of the people.

01:41.895 --> 01:43.356
I don't think
we should talk politics.

01:43.456 --> 01:45.358
A million and eleven,

01:45.458 --> 01:46.519
a million and twelve...

01:46.619 --> 01:47.519
a million, thirteen...

01:47.619 --> 01:49.761
a million, sign.

01:49.861 --> 01:50.842
Sign!

01:50.942 --> 01:52.243
- Hey, look!
- ZEKE: Whoa, whoa!

01:52.343 --> 01:53.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa.

01:53.784 --> 01:55.005
Hey, look, it's a sign.

01:55.105 --> 01:56.366
Yeah!
Branchwater.

01:56.466 --> 02:00.009
Oh, that is the nastiest
saloon town I've ever been to.

02:00.109 --> 02:02.130
And this is coming from
a guy who spent New Year's

02:02.230 --> 02:03.571
at the Alabama Ass Factory.

02:03.671 --> 02:05.853
- Ooh.
- Sounds wild. Let's go!

02:05.953 --> 02:06.894
No, no, guys,
if we're trying

02:06.994 --> 02:08.295
to get to Oregon
before winter,

02:08.395 --> 02:09.656
we do not have time
for a detour.

02:09.756 --> 02:11.457
- [all groan]
- Come on, Zeke.

02:11.557 --> 02:13.539
These people need a break.
I need a break.

02:13.639 --> 02:15.540
It'll be good for morale.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.982
- I don't know.
- Please?

02:18.082 --> 02:19.823
Come on, please, please,
please, please, please?

02:19.923 --> 02:20.824
Please, please,
please, please.

02:20.924 --> 02:23.546
[saxophone music resumes]

02:23.646 --> 02:26.308
Oh--yes. Okay, one.
One night. That's it.

02:26.408 --> 02:28.990
Hey folks!
We're going to Branchwater!

02:29.090 --> 02:31.792
[all cheering]

02:31.892 --> 02:33.233
Yes!

02:33.333 --> 02:34.394
[cheering continues]

02:34.494 --> 02:36.636
Hyah!

02:36.736 --> 02:38.317
Well, well, well.

02:38.417 --> 02:40.839
You see that, Angela?

02:40.939 --> 02:43.781
Looks like we're heading
to Branchwater.

02:44.782 --> 02:47.044
Oh, Angela!
Did you fart again?

02:47.144 --> 02:49.646
I told you to stop
eating dairy!

02:49.746 --> 02:51.447
BENNY: All right,
folks, we made it!

02:51.547 --> 02:53.008
It's party time!

02:53.108 --> 02:55.170
I'm getting so drunk,
I'm gonna piss myself.

02:55.270 --> 02:56.611
Me too, honey.

02:56.711 --> 02:57.972
Are you coming in?

02:58.072 --> 02:59.613
No, I'm just gonna
wait by the wagon

02:59.713 --> 03:02.415
and protect my soul
from eternal damnation.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.896
But you have fun.
Come on!

03:03.996 --> 03:05.978
I just want to party
with my best friend.

03:06.078 --> 03:08.860
And ooh! Wait.
Do I hear God?

03:08.960 --> 03:11.422
"Zeke, I command thee
to have fun

03:11.522 --> 03:12.743
for once in your life."

03:12.843 --> 03:14.424
No, that's deeply
sacrilegious, Pru.

03:14.524 --> 03:17.106
"And buy Prudence shots.
Lots and lots of shots."

03:17.206 --> 03:18.547
As I said, no thanks.

03:18.647 --> 03:20.689
A place like this is
no place for a reverend.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.751
[sighs] All right, fine.

03:23.851 --> 03:26.113
You know, you should try
to loosen up.

03:26.213 --> 03:28.234
Just once. I don't know.
You might like it.

03:28.334 --> 03:31.597
The Bible is what I like.

03:31.697 --> 03:33.679
"These are the names
of the sons of Abraham,

03:33.779 --> 03:36.481
"according to their families,
after their places,

03:36.581 --> 03:37.802
by their names."

03:37.902 --> 03:39.403
- [ox grunts]
- Fun.

03:39.503 --> 03:40.283
Fun, fun, fun.

03:40.383 --> 03:42.485
All right, folks.

03:42.585 --> 03:43.886
I say we hit the bar first,

03:43.986 --> 03:45.447
and then we check out
the brothel.

03:45.547 --> 03:47.209
Oh, I am so sorry.
Unfortunately,

03:47.309 --> 03:49.730
we are at capacity
right now.
Capacity?

03:49.830 --> 03:50.931
They used to pack this place

03:51.031 --> 03:51.972
tighter than
a sardine barrel.

03:52.072 --> 03:53.653
Oh, you're one of
the old-timers.

03:53.753 --> 03:54.854
Yeah, the Oregon Trail

03:54.954 --> 03:56.776
brought in a ton
of new customers,

03:56.876 --> 03:58.737
so management made
a few changes

03:58.837 --> 04:00.539
to appeal to
a wider clientele.

04:00.639 --> 04:01.819
But if you want to wait
by the gift shop,

04:01.919 --> 04:04.061
I'll let you know as soon as
some space opens up.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.782
Gift shop?

04:05.882 --> 04:07.984
Key chains?
T-shirts?

04:08.084 --> 04:10.946
"The Original
Devil's Taint Cookbook"?

04:11.046 --> 04:12.748
What the hell happened
to this place?

04:12.848 --> 04:14.149
It totally sold out.

04:14.249 --> 04:16.230
Hairy bastard!

04:16.330 --> 04:19.192
Is that what passes as
a saloon brawl these days?

04:19.292 --> 04:20.633
Pretty weak.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.315
Looks like some space
just opened up.

04:22.415 --> 04:25.037
- Enjoy.
- Let's go.

04:25.137 --> 04:28.239
"And though shalt know
that I am the Lord."

04:28.339 --> 04:30.641
Whoo! Evenin', my lad!

04:30.741 --> 04:32.963
What's a handsome
young fella like you

04:33.063 --> 04:34.964
doing here all alone
instead of out on the town?

04:35.064 --> 04:36.886
Oh, well, no,
it's not really my scene.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.367
I'm--I'm--I'm a reverend.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.328
Then we both do
the Lord's work.

04:40.428 --> 04:42.130
I peddle miracle cures.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.491
I'm a snake oil salesman.
Snake oil?

04:44.591 --> 04:46.733
Um...no offense, but,

04:46.833 --> 04:48.814
isn't that just
a bunch of hokum?
Not at all.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.817
Snake oil is
a potent aphrodisiac.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.339
Might come in handy
with that young missus

04:54.439 --> 04:55.580
I saw you with earlier?

04:55.680 --> 04:56.820
Oh, that lady's
not my missus.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.181
We're just friends.

04:58.281 --> 05:01.064
My mistake. Snake oil
is not merely an aphrodisiac,

05:01.164 --> 05:02.825
it's also quite good
with hair loss.

05:02.925 --> 05:04.426
Oh. I don't have
that issue.

05:04.526 --> 05:05.787
Well, what do you got?
Back pain?

05:05.887 --> 05:06.748
- No.
- Tennis elbow?

05:06.848 --> 05:07.829
- No.
- The pox.

05:07.929 --> 05:08.949
- No, not yet.
- Burgundy stool.

05:09.049 --> 05:10.511
- No.
- Uh, anxiety?

05:10.611 --> 05:11.832
Oh, my friend
did just tell me

05:11.932 --> 05:13.933
I could stand to
loosen up a bit.

05:14.494 --> 05:16.835
That's what snake oil
is for!

05:16.935 --> 05:18.557
But don't take
my word for it.

05:18.657 --> 05:21.279
Here.
Try one of my samples.

05:21.379 --> 05:22.520
See for yourself.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.621
Thank you.

05:27.463 --> 05:29.085
Oh. Oh, that's good.

05:29.185 --> 05:30.726
Yeah. Oh, it's got
an aftertaste.

05:30.826 --> 05:31.967
Yeah, kinda snakey.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.408
Now you only need
a little bit.

05:33.508 --> 05:35.890
Just one or two drops
ought to do it.
[gulping] Mmm!

05:35.990 --> 05:37.971
Hey, man. Don't tell me
how to live my life.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.073
Shit, this stuff's great.

05:41.033 --> 05:42.575
Are you gonna be
all right here?
Oh, yes.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.817
I'll just amuse myself by
looking at the pretty bottles.

05:45.917 --> 05:47.098
All right, I'm gonna go
find the poker table,

05:47.198 --> 05:48.459
throw some cash around
with the big boys.

05:48.559 --> 05:49.660
Wish me luck.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.181
[sighs]

05:51.281 --> 05:53.282
Hey, barkeep. Whiskey.

05:55.324 --> 05:56.705
[shrill laughter]

05:56.805 --> 05:58.667
And so that is why

05:58.767 --> 06:00.588
I raised the prices
on the Tijuana Coochie Twist.

06:00.688 --> 06:02.870
Finally, girl.
That move is worth it.

06:02.970 --> 06:05.111
- [laughter]
- Um, excuse me.

06:05.211 --> 06:07.713
Are you ladies
women of the night?

06:07.813 --> 06:09.154
[all gasp]

06:09.254 --> 06:10.595
It's the 1840s.

06:10.695 --> 06:12.117
The preferred term
is whores.

06:12.217 --> 06:15.879
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean
to offend you...whores.

06:15.979 --> 06:17.881
I just think what you do
is so amazing.

06:17.981 --> 06:19.602
It's always sounded
so exotic.

06:19.702 --> 06:20.583
Well, would you want
to give it a try?

06:20.663 --> 06:22.404
[scoffs] What? No!

06:22.504 --> 06:24.045
Me? Come--really?

06:24.145 --> 06:26.047
Come on, let's just get you
into a dress.

06:26.147 --> 06:28.209
We have one exactly
your size.

06:28.309 --> 06:30.090
One of the girls was just
stabbed to death in it.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.272
Oh. Just my luck.
[laughter]

06:35.714 --> 06:37.255
[clears throat]
Excuse me, boys.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.216
You mind if I join?

06:38.316 --> 06:39.937
This ain't no game
for a gentleman.

06:40.037 --> 06:41.699
I may be a gentleman,

06:41.799 --> 06:44.261
but, uh...whew.

06:44.361 --> 06:45.622
My friends here...

06:45.722 --> 06:47.763
well, they play real dirty.

06:49.204 --> 06:51.206
Take a seat.

06:53.527 --> 06:55.529
Interesting.

06:57.690 --> 06:58.791
All in.

06:58.891 --> 07:00.272
Full house.

07:00.372 --> 07:02.374
Shit!

07:03.495 --> 07:04.996
[clears throat] That's...

07:05.096 --> 07:07.158
Okay.
Let me just, um...

07:07.258 --> 07:09.319
Okay.

07:09.419 --> 07:11.321
Now I'm focused.

07:11.421 --> 07:12.361
I'm sorry, madam,

07:12.461 --> 07:14.643
this prostitution menu
is ridiculous.

07:14.743 --> 07:16.284
There's too many choices.

07:16.384 --> 07:17.765
I remember when
all you could order

07:17.865 --> 07:19.207
was a 2-buck
pump and dump.

07:19.307 --> 07:21.308
And that was
all you needed.

07:22.549 --> 07:24.550
Benny the Teen.

07:26.752 --> 07:28.854
Choose your last words
carefully,

07:28.954 --> 07:32.036
because this time,
there'll be no escape.

07:33.877 --> 07:35.819
Whoopsie!
I'll take that.

07:35.919 --> 07:37.780
This is a no-shooting
establishment after 6:00.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.181
You can grab your gun
from the valet

07:39.281 --> 07:41.103
on your way out.
Thank you so much!

07:41.203 --> 07:41.943
Cute hat.

07:42.043 --> 07:43.705
I'm sorry, what the hell?

07:43.805 --> 07:46.307
I know!
This place sucks now.

07:46.407 --> 07:48.408
What the [bleep]?

07:51.050 --> 07:54.073
Almost done! And...

07:54.173 --> 07:55.634
Voila.

07:55.734 --> 07:58.476
Oh, my God.
I look like a whore.

07:58.576 --> 07:59.797
And I love it!

07:59.897 --> 08:01.638
Girl, you're like
a young Betsy Ross,

08:01.738 --> 08:04.600
but like, a whore.
[laughs]

08:04.700 --> 08:06.242
Ha, ha!

08:06.342 --> 08:08.964
Howdy, folks.
Somebody order a party?

08:09.064 --> 08:12.286
- Reverend Brown?
- Farmer John! Looking sexy!

08:12.386 --> 08:14.688
Granny McGill,
we are doing shots later

08:14.788 --> 08:16.789
and you're not
getting out of it.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.571
Zeke, is that you?

08:18.671 --> 08:21.773
- [gasps]
- WHORES: Your first client!

08:21.873 --> 08:23.975
Whoa, Prude!
Is that you?

08:24.075 --> 08:25.336
What do you think?
Just a little something

08:25.436 --> 08:27.818
I picked up from
a dead whore's closet.

08:27.918 --> 08:28.838
Thought you were waiting
in the wagon.

08:28.918 --> 08:30.820
Hmm, well, yes, I was.
But then,

08:30.920 --> 08:32.821
I had a little bit
of this snake oil,

08:32.921 --> 08:34.503
and now I'm feeling good.

08:34.603 --> 08:37.105
Reverend Brown gettin' down
with snake oil?

08:37.205 --> 08:38.346
- What would Jesus think?
- Bleagh!

08:38.446 --> 08:40.307
Who cares what he thinks?
Aah! [laughs]

08:40.407 --> 08:41.788
I've lived my whole life
with all those rules

08:41.888 --> 08:43.629
and restrictions.
I've been such a dork, right?

08:43.729 --> 08:44.790
- I mean, yeah, a little.
- Yeah!

08:44.890 --> 08:45.991
I just want to scream it
out to the world--

08:46.091 --> 08:48.313
Reverend Ezekiel Brown
is a big fat dork!

08:48.413 --> 08:49.754
Oh, my God! Stop.

08:49.854 --> 08:51.796
But don't. I love it.
You hearing that music?

08:51.896 --> 08:53.036
Is it coming from the piano
or is it coming

08:53.136 --> 08:54.217
straight from my heart?
Do you want to dance?

08:54.297 --> 08:56.759
No, Prudence,
I don't want to dance.

08:56.859 --> 08:58.440
- I need to dance.
- [giggles]

08:58.540 --> 09:00.762
I mean, what the hell
happened to this place?

09:00.862 --> 09:02.644
Used to be you could come in
any night of the week

09:02.744 --> 09:04.525
and you'd find
Three-Fingered Joe

09:04.625 --> 09:06.206
strangling anyone who
looked at him sideways.

09:06.306 --> 09:07.848
- Oh, Dirty Dick Bob.
- Right?

09:07.948 --> 09:08.848
Sticking his you-know-what

09:08.948 --> 09:10.249
into whatever hole
he could find.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.091
Kids these days
are buying cowboy hats

09:12.191 --> 09:13.732
with bullet holes
already in them.

09:13.832 --> 09:15.053
- You're kidding!
- No!

09:15.153 --> 09:17.094
Sorry for that long wait.
Now what can I get you?

09:17.194 --> 09:19.016
I'll have a steak,
bloody.

09:19.116 --> 09:20.737
- Make that two.
- Ooh, sorry.

09:20.837 --> 09:22.338
We actually stopped
carrying steak.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.460
- No steak?
- We do have shishito peppers,

09:24.560 --> 09:26.982
that are lightly drizzled
with Ortega cheese,

09:27.082 --> 09:29.143
that are just
absolutely mmm!

09:29.243 --> 09:30.865
All right, that's it.
I've had enough!

09:30.965 --> 09:32.066
[pounds table, objects clatter]

09:32.166 --> 09:33.867
That's what's wrong
with this country today!

09:33.967 --> 09:36.069
You make everything
clean and nice

09:36.169 --> 09:37.910
and pretty for everyone,
but then you lose

09:38.010 --> 09:40.192
what makes it cool
and authentic and real!

09:40.292 --> 09:42.193
I want the grit!
I want the soul!

09:42.293 --> 09:44.795
Yeah!
Most of all,
I want my goddamn steak!

09:44.895 --> 09:46.276
Do you want to speak
to the manager?

09:46.376 --> 09:48.598
Yes, I'd like to speak
to the manager, thank you.

09:48.698 --> 09:50.039
Ho ho, that was great!

09:50.139 --> 09:51.440
Was the fist slam too much?

09:51.540 --> 09:53.562
No, it was perfect.

09:53.662 --> 09:55.203
Ow.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.805
Well, it has not been
my night. [chuckles]

09:57.905 --> 09:59.326
I almost had you
on that last hand.

09:59.426 --> 10:01.427
Just... [clears throat]
Okay.

10:02.788 --> 10:03.889
Hoo! Finally.

10:03.989 --> 10:06.471
Okay, looks like my ship
has come in.

10:08.713 --> 10:10.374
- I'll raise.
- Sorry, pardner,

10:10.474 --> 10:11.775
but you got nothing left
to raise with.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.937
I have more money,
in my wagon.

10:15.037 --> 10:16.339
Well, I'm good for it.
I swear.

10:16.439 --> 10:19.581
I'll take the gentleman's
word for it. Let's see.

10:19.681 --> 10:21.783
Four aces.

10:21.883 --> 10:23.744
Read 'em and weep,
you filthy bastards!

10:23.844 --> 10:25.225
Not so fast.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.266
Five aces.

10:26.366 --> 10:28.428
What? How is that
even possible?

10:28.528 --> 10:29.348
Hold on.

10:29.448 --> 10:32.150
- Twelve aces.
- MAN: Dang it!

10:32.250 --> 10:35.553
I do not understand
the rules of this game.

10:35.653 --> 10:37.955
Gentlemen, you wanted to speak
with the manager?

10:38.055 --> 10:39.356
You're damn right
we want to--

10:39.456 --> 10:41.998
- Dirty Dick Bob?
- Benny the Teen?

10:42.098 --> 10:43.679
Bounty hunter with no name?

10:43.779 --> 10:45.040
How the hell are you guys?

10:45.140 --> 10:47.081
We were just talking
about you!

10:47.181 --> 10:49.003
- What?
- How'd they let a nasty pervert

10:49.103 --> 10:51.845
like Dirty Dick Bob
run a slick joint like this?

10:51.945 --> 10:54.087
Actually, it's
Dirty Dick Robert now.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.728
I run the front of the house,

10:55.828 --> 10:56.849
and my wife
handles the books.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.530
- You have a wife?
- I sure do.

10:58.630 --> 11:01.092
I can't believe it!
You used to stick your dick

11:01.192 --> 11:02.333
into anything that moved!

11:02.433 --> 11:03.454
And plenty of stuff
that didn't!

11:03.554 --> 11:06.016
Yes, I did fornicate
with objects,

11:06.116 --> 11:08.057
but you can't stay young
forever.

11:08.157 --> 11:09.778
Eventually
you gotta grow up

11:09.878 --> 11:11.540
and start having a real life.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.662
But enough about me.
What have you guys been up to?

11:14.762 --> 11:16.223
Oh, you know,
mostly the same stuff.

11:16.323 --> 11:17.424
You know,
chasing this guy.

11:17.524 --> 11:19.706
Yeah, the same.
Being chased by him.

11:19.806 --> 11:23.549
Wow, so you guys are still
doing that whole thing.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.950
Well, cool. Very cool.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.072
[stammers]
I'd love to stay and chat,

11:28.172 --> 11:29.873
but I should get back to work.

11:29.973 --> 11:32.115
Sure, but maybe we could
all hang out sometime.

11:32.215 --> 11:34.277
Maybe. It--it's difficult
with the kids and all.

11:34.377 --> 11:36.798
Hostess, more
shishito peppers over here!

11:36.898 --> 11:38.840
On the house!
[laughs]

11:38.940 --> 11:40.281
Huh.

11:40.381 --> 11:41.682
Yeah.

11:44.824 --> 11:46.286
Touch it!
It's electric, right?

11:46.386 --> 11:47.687
Why can't it be
like this forever?

11:47.787 --> 11:50.168
I don't want to go to stupid
Oregon and be a boring wife.

11:50.268 --> 11:52.250
Shh! Shh!
Shush your mouth right now.

11:52.350 --> 11:54.131
I'm shushing.
Nothing has to change
after this trip.

11:54.231 --> 11:56.773
It's your life, and you can do
whatever you want to do,

11:56.873 --> 11:58.134
and be whoever
you want to be.

11:58.234 --> 12:00.416
You're right.
Thanks, Zeke.

12:00.516 --> 12:01.417
I have an idea.

12:01.517 --> 12:02.818
Why don't we do
some more snake oil?

12:02.918 --> 12:04.139
Are you sure you need
any more?

12:04.239 --> 12:05.500
We're already having fun.
But think about it--

12:05.600 --> 12:07.181
if we're having fun now,
things will be extra fun

12:07.281 --> 12:08.822
with more snake oil!
That's just basic math.

12:08.922 --> 12:10.984
Still a pass for me.
Thanks, though.
Oh, all right, Mom.

12:11.084 --> 12:13.426
More yum-yums
for Freaky Zekey.

12:13.526 --> 12:14.226
Whoa, easy, champ.

12:14.326 --> 12:16.148
Okay, Zeke, no.
Come on.

12:16.248 --> 12:18.189
You need to take it down,
like, so many notches.

12:18.289 --> 12:19.450
You're acting out of control.
Out of control? No.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.992
I am in control for
the first time in my life.

12:22.092 --> 12:24.274
There are no consequences
to my actions. I'm free!

12:24.374 --> 12:25.675
[slowed-down evil laughter]

12:25.775 --> 12:27.316
You're next, Ezekiel.

12:27.416 --> 12:29.458
Ahh! The devil has come
for my soul!

I just meant

12:33.981 --> 12:35.983

- Zeke.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.284
Maybe my girlfriend's right.

12:38.384 --> 12:41.026
Maybe I do come on too strong.

12:46.190 --> 12:47.491
Can you believe
Dirty Dick Bob sold out?

12:47.591 --> 12:50.013
What a loser, huh?
I don't know, Benny.

12:50.113 --> 12:52.115
What if we're the losers?

12:53.235 --> 12:55.577
What are you talking about?
We're the only real ones left.

12:55.677 --> 12:56.978
- Remember?
- Are we?

12:57.078 --> 12:58.219
Look at us.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.700
We're doing the same thing

12:59.800 --> 13:00.941
we were doing
since we were kids.

13:01.041 --> 13:05.144
We don't have families
or houses or real jobs.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.106
It's kinda pathetic,
isn't it?

13:07.206 --> 13:08.907
Let me ask you something--
do you love it?

13:09.007 --> 13:10.949
- Oh, stop it.
- Do you love it?

13:11.049 --> 13:12.350
Of course I love it.

13:12.450 --> 13:16.713
But there comes a time
when you have to move on.

13:16.813 --> 13:18.975
Leave childish things
behind.

13:20.816 --> 13:22.817

to see me like this.

for your cheap tricks.

my entire fortune.

- You did what?
- Yeah, don't tell the missus.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.093
Anyway, I gotta get
out of here quick

17:14.310 --> 17:16.612
I know. Look, Pru,
I'm so sorry.

17:16.712 --> 17:18.693
I tried to bury these feelings
for a long time.

17:18.793 --> 17:21.736
I'm sorry, this is
a lot to take in.

17:21.836 --> 17:23.837
I'm gonna go.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.538
Girl troubles, huh?

17:25.638 --> 17:27.300
You know the best cure
for that?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.902
- Snake oil.
- You just told me it was fake.

17:30.002 --> 17:32.143
Shit.

Well, I guess
this is goodbye.

17:39.369 --> 17:41.310
Yeah, you know,
this feels kinda weird.

17:41.410 --> 17:42.951
Guess I thought
we'd be doing this forever.

17:43.051 --> 17:45.673
You're a free man, right?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.075
You finally got away from me,
fair and square.

You take care,

Hey.

My fingers are feeling
a little sticky.

18:03.226 --> 18:05.288
I'm thinking I might
steal this horse.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.790
Okay, don't do that.
You know that's a felony.

18:09.431 --> 18:11.733
Oops.
Did I do that?

18:11.833 --> 18:14.655
All right, you'd
better stop that, Benjamin.

18:14.755 --> 18:16.756
