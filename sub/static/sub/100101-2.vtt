00:03.137 --> 00:04.503
Good morning, everyone.

00:04.555 --> 00:06.605
Good morning.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.452
The Senate Intelligence
Committee will begin

00:08.476 --> 00:10.442
its investigation into
the McCord campaign

00:10.511 --> 00:12.194
this afternoon
with a closed hearing

00:12.279 --> 00:13.896
with counselor to the president

00:13.981 --> 00:16.114
and former campaign manager
Michael Barnow.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.117
While President McCord
is wholly confident that

00:18.185 --> 00:20.119
the Senate Intelligence
Committee will find

00:20.187 --> 00:22.020
no evidence
whatsoever to support

00:22.073 --> 00:25.290
Senator Hanson's claims
that the McCord campaign

00:25.359 --> 00:27.054
cooperated with Iran's
interference in the election,

00:27.078 --> 00:29.194
she respects and supports
Congress' right

00:29.246 --> 00:31.296
to oversee the executive branch,

00:31.365 --> 00:34.166
and pledges full cooperation.

00:34.218 --> 00:36.468
President McCord's historic
education, science,

00:36.537 --> 00:39.338
and infrastructure bill passed
with bipartisan support

00:39.390 --> 00:41.473
in Congress last week,
and is moving forward.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.942
Finally, following
a long-standing

00:42.977 --> 00:44.176
White House tradition,

00:44.245 --> 00:46.378
President McCord will
throw out the first pitch

00:46.447 --> 00:48.847
for the New York Mets' opening
game at Citi Field this week.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.143
I'm told Syndergaard
better watch his back.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.652
I'll take questions.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.554
Daisy. Daisy.
Steve, go ahead.

00:55.606 --> 00:57.740
This morning saw
three major demonstrations

00:57.825 --> 00:59.891
protesting the severe hike
in gas prices

00:59.944 --> 01:02.277
brought on by the new gas tax
in the infrastructure bill.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.613
How does President McCord
respond to the criticism

01:04.697 --> 01:08.167
that this tax unfairly burdens
lower-income Americans?

01:08.235 --> 01:10.097
The president is very aware
that Americans are

01:10.121 --> 01:11.431
feeling it at the pump
this week.

01:11.455 --> 01:14.406
As tough as it is,
it's important to keep in mind

01:14.458 --> 01:16.125
that this is
a short-term hardship

01:16.210 --> 01:18.460
that will lead to
long-term gains.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.466
It's also true that
the recent oil refinery fire

01:20.548 --> 01:21.797
outside Philadelphia

01:21.882 --> 01:23.715
caused a spike in fuel prices

01:23.768 --> 01:26.268
- in many eastern states.
- Daisy. Daisy.

01:26.353 --> 01:29.104
Keira.
This morning's poll
in the <i> Washington Chronicle</i>

01:29.190 --> 01:31.756
show's President McCord's
lowest approval rating

01:31.809 --> 01:33.425
since she took office.

01:33.477 --> 01:35.760
Is the president concerned
that the controversial

01:35.813 --> 01:37.762
gas tax is responsible
for the drop?

01:37.815 --> 01:39.097
Well, the ESI bill is

01:39.150 --> 01:41.150
the most sweeping legislation
since the New Deal.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.679
And it's gonna take
months and years

01:42.703 --> 01:45.287
before its effects will reach
every community.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.072
A poll is just
one moment in time.

01:47.124 --> 01:49.044
But the point the protesters
are making is that

01:49.109 --> 01:51.126
a uniform fuel tax
puts a greater burden

01:51.212 --> 01:53.045
on lower-income Americans,

01:53.113 --> 01:55.192
and it should be replaced by
a tax commensurate with income.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.116
Again, the minimal fuel tax
is being temporarily inflated

01:58.169 --> 02:00.586
due to the recent
oil refinery accident.

02:00.638 --> 02:04.173
So-so you're saying
the protesters are overreacting?
Of course not, Frank.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.174
When do you expect
the prices to go down?

02:05.259 --> 02:07.426
I don't have
projections on that.

02:07.478 --> 02:08.738
Why is the president
throwing out

02:08.762 --> 02:09.872
the first pitch for the Mets?

02:09.896 --> 02:11.408
Does she have a special
connection to the team?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.826
Well, as president
of the United States,

02:12.850 --> 02:14.244
she supports every
great American team.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.652
And also, the Mets worked
with her schedule.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.570
Thanks, everyone, that's all.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.908
I can admit when I'm wrong.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.577
Are we taking this
healthy thing too far?

02:25.646 --> 02:26.995
I wouldn't call it wrong.

02:27.081 --> 02:30.415
It's just a lot of chewing.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.619
You know, you could get
your chief of staff

02:33.671 --> 02:36.038
to bring us some
of those dumplings.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.874
The fried ones
from Imperial Palace.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.154
Sneak it right by the kitchen.
Chef Cindy will never know.

02:41.178 --> 02:43.762
It's almost like we both
worked in intelligence.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.516
Oh, it's just growing pains.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.667
Madam President?

02:48.719 --> 02:49.668
Good morning.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.853
Oh, you're just in time for

02:50.938 --> 02:53.004
ancient grains and, uh,

02:53.057 --> 02:54.690
marinated tofu.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.526
Yeah, I'm cutting back.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.144
Russia briefing.
Right.

02:59.196 --> 03:00.979
Yeah. Wait a minute.

03:01.031 --> 03:02.447
Where did I leave that binder?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.956
Bedside table.
You really should find

03:03.984 --> 03:06.118
some lighter bedtime
reading, babe.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.237
No. Actually, it was great.

03:08.322 --> 03:11.156
State is killing it
on this deal with Russia.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.624
You're killing it
as well, ma'am.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.710
He has to be nice to me now.
It's weird, right?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.194
Well, he is right.

03:16.247 --> 03:18.363
ESI was a huge victory.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.466
Yeah. Not for everyone.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.586
Honeymoon's over.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.805
At least 40% of the country's
gonna hate you

03:26.873 --> 03:30.875
at any given time, you might
as well get used to it.

03:30.928 --> 03:34.763
I was thinking about responding
to the protests.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.765
You know, explain
the long-term benefits

03:36.850 --> 03:39.101
of the bill.
It already passed.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.403
People hear a president
talking about taxes,

03:41.488 --> 03:42.738
that's all they hear.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.824
Yeah, well, that's all
they're talking about as is.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.370
I mean, we're losing
the message.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.728
Well, then, let Daisy
face the firing squad.

03:49.780 --> 03:50.895
That's her job.

03:50.948 --> 03:54.116
Elizabeth is the one
that talked the Russians into

03:54.201 --> 03:55.211
de-alerting their
nukes, Russell.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.429
Why not let her get out there?

03:56.453 --> 03:59.738
Because she's not
a diplomat anymore.

03:59.790 --> 04:01.173
She's a leader.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.509
Leaders don't negotiate
with protesters, it looks...

04:04.578 --> 04:06.678
Responsive?
Weak.

04:08.966 --> 04:09.966
You ready?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.967
By all means,
let's go hold hands

04:12.052 --> 04:13.719
with a bunch of protesters

04:13.771 --> 04:17.723
who don't know how to open
a savings account.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.725
I need the briefing materials
for the meeting

04:19.777 --> 04:22.110
with the secretary of commerce.

04:22.196 --> 04:25.397
And cancel my lunch
with Senator Baker.

04:25.449 --> 04:27.316
Reschedule it for
after the Russian signing.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.411
Where are we with the head count

04:28.435 --> 04:30.369
on the signing ceremony?

04:32.289 --> 04:34.823
Sorry. Yes, they're
waiting for you.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.792
Did you hear anything
I just said?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.877
Mr. Barnow asked me
to wear these. He says

04:38.945 --> 04:42.297
all assistants are leakier
than his grandfather's dinghy.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.298
But I assure you,
I would never offer

04:43.384 --> 04:45.450
confidential information
to any...

04:45.502 --> 04:47.836
I'm confused.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.722
Did we cooperate
with the Iran hack or not?

04:50.791 --> 04:51.757
Good morning.
We did not.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.925
Then why the hell do I have

04:53.978 --> 04:55.978
22 pages of strategy

04:56.063 --> 04:58.480
for a Senate Intelligence
Committee hearing about nothing?

04:58.565 --> 05:00.399
Obviously, this is pure theater.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.434
But with Mike's unusual
position at State

05:02.486 --> 05:03.496
and some of his relationships,

05:03.520 --> 05:05.048
we wanted to think
through every angle.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.855
Is there anything
to worry about?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.451
Is it ever pretty when
some puffed-up senator

05:08.475 --> 05:10.420
wants to play Jimmy Stewart and
shine a light on the operatives

05:10.444 --> 05:11.921
who actually make
this country run?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.496
I never crossed any lines,
and I definitely didn't

05:14.581 --> 05:16.176
help Iran hack into somebody's
divorce records,

05:16.200 --> 05:18.011
if for no other reason than
I wouldn't want anyone

05:18.035 --> 05:19.035
to hack into mine.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.985
That's actually not
a bad argument.

05:21.038 --> 05:22.371
Well, keep it minimal in there.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.156
You want political theater?
Let's bore 'em to death.

05:25.209 --> 05:27.737
The president made it clear
she wants full cooperation.
This is Washington.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.572
I can fully cooperate
without giving them anything.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.797
Why is POTUS weighing in
on this?

05:31.849 --> 05:33.076
I'm White House counsel,
Russell.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.050
She reached out to reiterate
her wishes.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.519
I thought I made it clear
she's out of the loop.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.170
One leaked comment
about strategy,

05:39.223 --> 05:41.890
the press will turn it
into a full-blown coverup.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.142
I haven't read her in
on anything substantive.

05:44.194 --> 05:47.229
She did, however, say that
if questioning gets into

05:47.314 --> 05:49.376
Mike's time as chief of staff,
she wants us to answer.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.117
Sure. Why would we bother
claiming executive privilege?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.820
This is why I don't
want her in the loop.

05:54.872 --> 05:55.987
Don't shoot the messenger.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.123
Guys, we all serve
at the pleasure.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.992
That doesn't mean we
help her commit suicide.

06:01.045 --> 06:03.045
Answer, but keep it minimal.
Yeah.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.331
And for God's sake,
stop reading her in!

06:09.470 --> 06:10.385
That <i> is</i> her.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.003
Yeah, that is her.

06:12.056 --> 06:13.588
Hey.
Hi. Hey.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.840
Uh...
Oh, I'm sor...

06:14.892 --> 06:16.558
Griffin. Sorry.
Hey. Stevie.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.043
Sorry. I'm never sure if
I should introduce myself or...

06:19.096 --> 06:22.731
Yeah, sure. I mean, I have
the same problem all the time.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.267
Not really.
Uh, thanks for meeting me.
Of course.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.852
I mean, thank you.

06:26.904 --> 06:29.738
Um, Blake had very nice
things to say about you, so...
Really?

06:29.823 --> 06:31.907
That's... Gosh, that's funny.
I always thought that

06:31.992 --> 06:33.253
he found me to be
a horrible roommate.

06:33.277 --> 06:34.225
No.

06:34.278 --> 06:36.244
But I was a reliable baritone

06:36.330 --> 06:38.062
in the a cappella group, so...
I see.

06:38.115 --> 06:41.065
That must have made up
for my poor dish washing skills.

06:41.118 --> 06:44.086
Boy, you're even
prettier in person.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.548
Oh...
Sorry. Oh, my God,
that's a weird thing to say.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.207
No. No, no.
It's totally fine.

06:49.259 --> 06:50.208
Um...
Forgive me.

06:50.260 --> 06:53.578
No, it's...

06:53.630 --> 06:55.514
I'm actually not really, like,

06:55.582 --> 06:58.249
used to being out in public.

06:58.302 --> 07:01.353
I usually just eat lunch
alone at my desk and...

07:01.421 --> 07:02.615
Sure, sure.
Oh, you have that...

07:02.639 --> 07:03.833
That's so cool, you're with the

07:03.857 --> 07:06.424
Human Amnesty Association.
Yeah.

07:06.477 --> 07:08.727
They must be really
grateful for the attention.

07:08.779 --> 07:12.430
I... hope I'm bringing
more to it

07:12.483 --> 07:15.367
than just attention, but
they probably are, yes.
I'm sorry.

07:19.123 --> 07:20.989
Do you solemnly swear
to give this committee

07:21.074 --> 07:22.635
the truth, the full truth,
and nothing but the truth

07:22.659 --> 07:23.608
so help you God?

07:23.660 --> 07:24.943
I do.

07:24.995 --> 07:27.278
Mr. Barnow,
would you describe

07:27.331 --> 07:28.808
your position
at the State Department?

07:28.832 --> 07:32.167
I served as Secretary's
unofficial advisor

07:32.252 --> 07:33.451
and legal counsel.

07:33.504 --> 07:35.554
This was a highly unusual
position, was it not?

07:35.622 --> 07:38.974
It was unusual for me
in that I wasn't paid.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.620
Ah, so you were rewarded
for your time

07:40.644 --> 07:43.345
with a senior White House
position?

07:43.430 --> 07:45.347
Mr. Barnow was clearly
a trusted advisor.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.776
I think the Committee
would agree

07:46.800 --> 07:49.801
that's pretty standard criterion
for a staff position.

07:49.853 --> 07:50.853
Very well.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.104
During your time as an unpaid,

07:52.138 --> 07:54.523
unofficial advisor
at the State Department,

07:54.608 --> 07:56.808
were you privy
to any negotiations

07:56.860 --> 07:58.743
for the United States'
agreement with Iran?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.078
I never reviewed any documents

08:00.146 --> 08:02.531
or spoke to any officials
regarding that agreement.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.843
When the secretary
traveled to Tehran

08:03.867 --> 08:05.584
for a secret meeting
with Zahed Javani,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.202
were you aware of the trip?

08:07.287 --> 08:10.922
I was not.
In your time as Candidate
McCord's campaign manager,

08:10.991 --> 08:12.340
were you ever approached
by anyone

08:12.426 --> 08:14.543
who offered damaging information

08:14.628 --> 08:17.546
about any of her
political opponents?
Like every campaign,

08:17.631 --> 08:20.298
we contracted with a firm
for oppositional research,

08:20.350 --> 08:23.218
but we saw no need to seek
or accept any information

08:23.303 --> 08:24.831
outside of that which we were
already paying for.

08:24.855 --> 08:27.672
Did this research include
information about

08:27.724 --> 08:30.025
Senator Miller's
extramarital affair,

or his illegitimate children?

08:32.895 --> 08:34.145
No, it did not.

08:34.198 --> 08:35.730
You had no knowledge whatsoever

08:35.816 --> 08:37.515
of those allegations

08:37.568 --> 08:38.995
before they were reported
in the press?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.035
I was notified the day
before it was published.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.405
Really? Because
in your written testimony,

08:43.490 --> 08:45.907
you stated you had
no knowledge of it prior

08:45.993 --> 08:47.358
to its being published.

08:47.411 --> 08:51.329
Mr. Barnow was contacted
for comment the day before.

08:51.381 --> 08:53.915
This is clearly what he meant
by having learned of the story

08:54.001 --> 08:55.001
through the press.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.288
Madam President,
are you concerned

09:05.312 --> 09:07.378
about the investigation
of your campaign manager?

09:07.431 --> 09:09.731
What are your goals for your
upcoming visit to Lebanon?

09:09.816 --> 09:11.433
Will you consider eliminating

09:11.518 --> 09:12.958
the gas tax
in light of the protests?

09:14.988 --> 09:19.574
Listen, one of my primary
initiatives in the ESI bill

09:19.660 --> 09:21.743
was to wean us away
from foreign oil

09:21.828 --> 09:24.613
and to foster the growth
of renewable energy.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.415
Now, I know that
a lot of Americans

09:27.501 --> 09:29.084
are feeling this right now.

09:29.169 --> 09:33.421
I remember when Henry and I
both had long commutes,

09:33.507 --> 09:37.259
and a spike in oil prices meant
we had a lot less

09:37.344 --> 09:39.628
at the end of every month.
How did you get through it?

09:39.713 --> 09:42.931
I mean, one of the things
that we did,

09:43.016 --> 09:45.884
we checked the air pressure
in our tires regularly.

09:45.936 --> 09:48.970
And believe it or not,
that little bit of maintenance

09:49.056 --> 09:52.774
gave us a few extra miles
on every tank, so...

09:52.859 --> 09:54.442
The point is,

09:54.528 --> 09:58.363
if we are going to address
climate change head on,

09:58.431 --> 10:02.233
then we need to come together
and make these sacrifices now,

10:02.286 --> 10:03.952
while there's still time left.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.320
Thank you.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.300
Madam President, when
you throw out the first pitch

10:07.324 --> 10:08.968
at Citi Field, will you
throw it from the stands

10:08.992 --> 10:10.075
or the mound?

10:10.127 --> 10:12.661
Did you ask my predecessor
that question?

10:12.746 --> 10:15.997
I'm gonna do what
every president

10:16.083 --> 10:17.582
since Ronald Reagan has done.

10:17.634 --> 10:19.784

60 feet, six inches.

"overprepared."

we could do about it.

And somehow, rather than think
about our dying campaign,

13:50.183 --> 13:52.249

knew everything about my family.

17:29.301 --> 17:31.235
And it... it got weird.
I don't know.

17:34.440 --> 17:37.140
Well, I guess it still
freaks me out.

I'd be Eloise.

17:43.532 --> 17:44.893
I'd move in, slide down
the bannisters, try to get

17:44.917 --> 17:46.650
the Secret Service
to dance with me.

17:46.702 --> 17:49.319
Try to get a good table
at that sushi spot

17:49.372 --> 17:50.704
that I can never get into.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.423
Hmm.
I get it. It's not you.

17:52.491 --> 17:54.491
You... You work at
a human rights organization,

17:54.543 --> 17:55.492
you're very serious
and committed.

17:55.544 --> 17:56.710
Excuse me.

17:56.796 --> 17:58.690
It's not like I never have fun.
How would I know?

17:58.714 --> 18:00.998
You haven't posted on Instagram
since the campaign.

18:01.050 --> 18:04.718
What? So if I don't post, that
means that I'm not having fun?

18:04.804 --> 18:06.331
That's what the youth of America
is saying.

18:06.355 --> 18:10.173
Blake...
See? Fun can be had while
working for the government.

18:10.226 --> 18:11.642
Very busy. Very busy.

18:15.231 --> 18:18.232
Resuming the testimony
of Michael Barnow.

18:18.317 --> 18:20.734
Right. So we had to miss
the campaign event in Portland,

18:20.820 --> 18:23.620
but thanks to the bird's
blessedly swift expiration,

18:23.689 --> 18:26.240
we were now making
excellent time to Bangor.

18:26.325 --> 18:28.220
Where you expected to receive
the endorsement of State Senator

18:28.244 --> 18:30.794
Cyrus Woodhouse
of Maine, correct?
Exactly.

18:30.863 --> 18:32.863
He was hosting
a summer fair at a

18:32.915 --> 18:34.415
community center
bearing his name.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.199
And with
Senator Woodhouse's endorsement,

18:36.252 --> 18:38.802
you felt reasonably confident
of winning Maine's

18:38.871 --> 18:41.839
second congressional district.
Netting us another
electoral vote.

18:41.907 --> 18:44.186
Which you desperately needed.
Not sure that's how I
would've put it at the time,

18:44.210 --> 18:45.709
but yes.

18:45.761 --> 18:46.894
It's go time, people!

18:46.979 --> 18:49.346
I'll get you some coffee.

18:49.398 --> 18:52.316
Hey, Bess? Senator Woodhouse
is right outside.

18:52.384 --> 18:53.462
I need you to work that old man

18:53.486 --> 18:55.163
like Daddy Warbucks
on Christmas. You with me?

18:55.187 --> 18:56.187
You got this?
Yeah.

18:56.238 --> 18:57.654
Grab your gla... glasses.
Coffee?

18:57.723 --> 18:58.772
Glasses.
Coffee.

18:58.858 --> 18:59.968
Glasses... Glasses on.
Okay.

18:59.992 --> 19:02.109
Glasses on.
Here we go.
This way.

19:02.194 --> 19:03.394
I'm going. Okay.
Walk this way.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.667
Senator Woodhouse,
second congressional district.

19:10.736 --> 19:13.620
Senator Woodhouse,
so nice to meet you, sir.
Thank you.

19:13.706 --> 19:14.738
It's not a good day.

19:14.790 --> 19:16.924
Senator, uh, Mike Barnow.

19:17.009 --> 19:18.320
I'm Secretary McCord's
campaign manager.

19:18.344 --> 19:19.259
We spoke on the phone.

19:19.345 --> 19:20.711
Oh, yes.

19:20.763 --> 19:22.429
Senator, I-I wanted

19:22.515 --> 19:25.299
to tell you how grateful I am
for this endorsement.

19:25.384 --> 19:28.469
I know that we can
do great things

19:28.554 --> 19:30.637
for the second congressional
district of Maine.

19:30.723 --> 19:32.439
Well, we'll have
to see about that.

19:32.525 --> 19:35.425
Not sure I can endorse
a Communist.
Senator...

19:35.478 --> 19:38.278
Listen, I love my
granddaughter to pieces.

19:38.364 --> 19:39.396
But she's a radical.

19:39.448 --> 19:41.899
And frankly, a bit
of a loose woman.

19:41.951 --> 19:44.318
If we could have a moment.

19:44.403 --> 19:45.464
These people
wanted to say "hi."

19:45.488 --> 19:47.099
Gosh, I haven't been
called that in years.

19:47.123 --> 19:49.101
Call the hotel in Augusta,
tell them we're gonna be early.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.941
Yeah.
No. No.

19:50.993 --> 19:52.521
We are not leaving.
We can stay.
Yes.

19:52.545 --> 19:54.444
The Pepperidge Farm guy
is sundowning.

19:54.497 --> 19:55.779
We're not staying.
Okay.

19:55.831 --> 19:57.414
So we don't get the endorsement.

19:57.466 --> 19:58.927
That's why we're here.
I mean, we're here.

19:58.951 --> 20:00.667
I-I got a great speech.

20:00.753 --> 20:02.002
It's... Everybody's w...

20:02.088 --> 20:03.003
There's a quilting bee.
Bess!

20:03.089 --> 20:04.089
Oh, my gosh...

20:04.123 --> 20:05.956
I think I feel worse
for the granddaughter.

20:06.008 --> 20:08.642
She's loose.
She doesn't care.

20:08.727 --> 20:11.895
The-the secretary wasn't
in charge of passports directly,

20:11.964 --> 20:13.463
but I will share your concerns.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.965
Will you excuse me
for one second?

20:15.017 --> 20:16.500
We are pulling the plug

20:16.569 --> 20:17.879
if this thing doesn't
get started in ten.

20:17.903 --> 20:19.820
Where's the senator?
I was about to ask you.

20:19.905 --> 20:22.406
Okay. Aw, will you yank her
out of the quilting circle?

20:22.474 --> 20:24.336
I have to hit the little
campaign manager's room,

20:24.360 --> 20:25.476
and then we're out.

20:28.197 --> 20:31.615
All I want is bad pay-per-view
and a minibar.

20:42.878 --> 20:44.545
That's not good.

20:49.518 --> 20:51.552
Senator?

20:51.637 --> 20:54.138
You need a hand in there?

21:12.825 --> 21:14.905
We're not getting that
endorsement, are we, Senator?

21:18.747 --> 21:20.347
S deceased,

21:20.399 --> 21:22.316
how did you proceed?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.117
The way any
campaign manager would.

21:24.186 --> 21:25.869
Determine the scope
of the crisis,

21:25.955 --> 21:27.988
secure the perimeters,
minimize the fallout.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.791
What "fallout," exactly,
were you concerned about?

21:30.859 --> 21:32.125
I had a candidate

21:32.194 --> 21:33.710
who was extremely
sleep-deprived,

21:33.796 --> 21:36.997
in denial/despair
about her sinking poll numbers,

21:37.049 --> 21:38.966
and feeling beaten up
by a hostile press.

21:39.034 --> 21:41.418
If we had to miss an event
to bury a dead bird,

21:41.503 --> 21:43.470
what was a dead senator
gonna do to us?

21:43.538 --> 21:45.005
We've got to get her on the bus.

21:45.057 --> 21:46.868
We've already missed the thing
in Portland, um,

21:46.892 --> 21:49.092
and we-we obviously
lost the endorsement.

21:49.178 --> 21:50.822
If we miss this town hall
in Burlington...

21:50.846 --> 21:52.229
Okay, okay.
What-what's the plan?

21:52.314 --> 21:54.348
Oh...

21:54.400 --> 21:56.440
You go get her, go get her.
I'll take care of this.

21:56.518 --> 21:57.901
Okay.
Go, go.

22:18.924 --> 22:20.924
♪ ♪

22:31.303 --> 22:35.522
Now, see, I've never even tried
to make a-a lattice crust.

22:35.590 --> 22:37.452
Hi... Hi. I have to steal
her for one second.

22:37.476 --> 22:39.109
Oh. Bye.

22:39.194 --> 22:41.594
Are we starting soon?
I can't feel my feet.

22:41.647 --> 22:43.596
Yes, um, slight change of plans.

22:43.649 --> 22:45.615
Um, there's a-a power
outage in Burlington...

22:45.701 --> 22:47.818
Oh.
so we have to go
there immediately,

22:47.903 --> 22:49.931
so they can have a tech check
first thing tomorrow morning.

22:49.955 --> 22:51.655
"Tech check."
"Tech check" rhymes.

22:51.740 --> 22:52.934
Yes, yes, yes.
You need sleep.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.157
Thanks so much!

22:54.243 --> 22:57.294
It was great to see you,
everybody. Don't forget to vote!

22:57.379 --> 22:59.046
Everybody on the bus.
Go, go, go,

22:59.114 --> 23:01.715
go, go, go.
We're going to hell.

23:01.783 --> 23:04.551
No, we're going
to the White House.

23:07.056 --> 23:10.590
Can you explain why,
in your haste,

23:10.642 --> 23:13.260
you took the time to call 911
from a pay phone?

23:13.312 --> 23:15.262
I'm sorry, what relevance
could that possibly...

23:15.314 --> 23:16.963
My son Zach has
a severe peanut allergy,

23:17.015 --> 23:18.131
and among other things

23:18.183 --> 23:20.484
we were told to always
call 911 from a landline

23:20.569 --> 23:23.770
so the dispatcher can trace
your call to a precise location

23:23.822 --> 23:25.583
and get the response team
there even faster.

23:25.607 --> 23:27.858
So you were just
following protocols,

23:27.943 --> 23:29.025
as you understood them.

23:29.111 --> 23:30.310
Absolutely.

23:30.362 --> 23:32.362
Can we hear the audio, please?

23:34.450 --> 23:36.533
911. What's your emergency?

23:36.618 --> 23:38.618
Yes, I would like
to report a death, a dead body.

23:38.670 --> 23:41.037
He is in the bathroom
at the Cyrus,

23:41.123 --> 23:43.990
uh, Woodhouse Community Center
on River Road.

23:44.042 --> 23:45.342
Yeah, on Cyrus Woodhouse.

23:45.427 --> 23:47.267
Yes, that's also the name
of the dead person.

23:47.296 --> 23:48.929
Can you tell me
exactly what happened,

23:48.997 --> 23:50.180
and who am I speaking to?

23:50.265 --> 23:51.381
I-I don't know! He was,

23:51.467 --> 23:53.194
he was very old,
and he's in the men's room,

23:53.218 --> 23:55.298
and I have to go, and no,
I cannot give you my name.

23:58.307 --> 23:59.606
You know, not every situation

23:59.674 --> 24:02.275
is actually in the
campaign manager's handbook.

24:09.985 --> 24:11.735
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:11.820 --> 24:13.537
please welcome to Citi Field

24:13.622 --> 24:16.823
the President
of the United States,

24:16.875 --> 24:19.159
Elizabeth McCord.

24:28.203 --> 24:30.504
Oh!

24:30.556 --> 24:33.723
Oh, my God!

24:36.061 --> 24:37.877
Come on, man.

24:37.930 --> 24:39.062
I didn't, I didn't...

24:39.148 --> 24:42.849
Mr. Met. No, no, no. I...

24:42.901 --> 24:45.569
Oh. Oh. Oh, my God.

24:55.330 --> 24:56.997
No, I didn't...

25:09.211 --> 25:12.345
Whoa, arm's looking good.

25:12.414 --> 25:13.880
(groans0

25:13.932 --> 25:17.417
Yeah, it's still not
the full distance yet. I...

25:17.469 --> 25:19.636
Well, what is it?

25:19.721 --> 25:24.274
The gas tax protests
or pitch anxiety?

25:24.359 --> 25:26.943
I had a nightmare

25:27.029 --> 25:29.896
that I beaned Mr. Met

25:29.948 --> 25:32.432
with my pitch. Yeah.

25:32.484 --> 25:34.067
I don't know,
it was probably a symbol

25:34.119 --> 25:37.270
for how I'm clobbering America

25:37.322 --> 25:39.122
with my gas tax.

25:39.208 --> 25:40.290
Well, I have something

25:40.375 --> 25:41.541
to take your mind off it.

25:41.610 --> 25:44.344
Guess who called me
yesterday.
Ali?

25:44.413 --> 25:48.048
No. I only hear from her when
I'm lurking on her Instagram.

25:48.116 --> 25:49.799
No, Dmitri Petrov.

25:49.885 --> 25:53.336
Is he allowed to call you?

25:53.422 --> 25:54.765
Well, you're
about to grant amnesty

25:54.789 --> 25:57.924
to U.S. and Russian intelligence
officers, so I'd say yes.

25:57.976 --> 25:59.175
What did he want?

25:59.261 --> 26:03.480
To thank us for the deal,
and to ask permission

26:03.565 --> 26:06.233
to contact Stevie.

26:06.301 --> 26:09.986
That's, like,
weirdly patriarchal

26:10.072 --> 26:11.655
and romantic at the same time.

26:11.740 --> 26:13.784
Uh, considering he was never
supposed to be dating her

26:13.808 --> 26:15.659
in the first place,
I appreciate the gesture.

26:15.744 --> 26:17.077
Well, what did you say?

26:17.145 --> 26:18.778
It was up to him.

26:20.699 --> 26:24.034
I mean, I kind of love that
he's still thinking about her,

26:24.119 --> 26:26.953
you know?
And I happen to believe

26:27.005 --> 26:30.257
that she's still hung up on him.

26:30.325 --> 26:31.958
Think we should give her
a heads-up?

26:32.010 --> 26:33.877
And risk watching her
spiral again

26:33.962 --> 26:35.211
if he doesn't follow through?

26:35.297 --> 26:37.430
No, thank you, sir.
True.

26:37.499 --> 26:40.850
I say we just stay out of it.

26:40.936 --> 26:45.055
You know? Let it play out
the way it's gonna play out.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.974
God, I love it
when it's not up to me.

26:50.512 --> 26:52.228
Okay.

26:52.314 --> 26:53.813
I love you.

26:53.865 --> 26:55.031
Come on.
I love you, too.

27:05.838 --> 27:07.571
I want to thank

27:07.623 --> 27:10.758
Secretary Thompson and
Foreign Minister Avdonin

27:10.843 --> 27:12.793
for this historic agreement

27:12.878 --> 27:15.045
between our nations.

27:15.097 --> 27:17.715
When two great powers come
together to share intelligence

27:17.767 --> 27:20.517
and unite against
common enemies,

27:20.586 --> 27:23.387
the whole world benefits,
so thank you.

27:25.274 --> 27:27.057
Thanks, everyone.
That's all for today.

27:27.109 --> 27:29.643
Konstantin, it's nice to be
working with you again.

27:29.729 --> 27:34.031
Congratulations on
the promotion, Madam President.

27:34.099 --> 27:37.818
Secretary Thompson,
you hit it out of the ballpark.

27:37.903 --> 27:40.654
You threw the pitch,
Madam President.

27:40.740 --> 27:43.323
Your boss is
a great diplomat, Nina.

27:43.409 --> 27:44.541
She learned from the best.

27:44.610 --> 27:45.959
Ma'am?
Yes?

27:46.045 --> 27:47.828
It's, uh, time to take you
to the stadium.

27:47.913 --> 27:50.664
Oh, boy.

27:50.750 --> 27:54.334
Does the President of Russia
also have to play sports?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.804
No, he chooses to,

27:56.889 --> 28:00.007
and somehow, he always wins.

28:00.092 --> 28:02.059
Get those to the
staff secretary.

28:02.127 --> 28:03.321
Make sure NSC has a copy.

28:03.345 --> 28:04.478
Of course, Mr. Jackson.

28:04.563 --> 28:06.563
What happened to the other kid,
uh, Trevor, was it?

28:06.632 --> 28:07.931
Travis.
Travis.

28:07.983 --> 28:10.634
I needed an upgrade.

28:10.686 --> 28:12.969
Senator Gates is waiting
in your office,

28:13.022 --> 28:14.466
I pushed the Transportation
Secretary to 3:00,

28:14.490 --> 28:16.940
and your wife asked
if you're free for lunch.

28:16.992 --> 28:19.326
You didn't answer, did you?

28:19.412 --> 28:23.163
I mentioned that you and
the Senator had plans, but...

28:23.249 --> 28:26.333
And then she asked you where,
and you told her,

28:26.419 --> 28:29.002
didn't you?
Damn it.

28:29.088 --> 28:30.088
Do you not understand

28:30.155 --> 28:31.872
when you're being worked
for information?

28:31.957 --> 28:34.208
I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

28:34.293 --> 28:35.926
You're damn right it won't.

28:50.192 --> 28:52.860
<i>I do not understand</i>

28:52.945 --> 28:55.779
why they are still attacking you
over the air pressure thing.

28:55.848 --> 28:59.032
I mean, it does save gas.

28:59.118 --> 29:01.618
Oh, my God.
If that's a meme about me,

29:01.687 --> 29:03.320
I don't want to see it.

29:03.372 --> 29:04.705
Mom, no.

29:04.790 --> 29:06.540
It's, uh, actually
it's from this guy

29:06.625 --> 29:08.459
that-that Blake set me up with.

29:08.527 --> 29:10.627
Um, we had a really
awkward lunch,

29:10.696 --> 29:13.247
and then... Here.
He hasn't given up.

29:13.332 --> 29:15.632
Isn't that good?

29:15.701 --> 29:17.918
Well, he's got strong GIF game,
I'll give him that.

29:18.003 --> 29:19.670
Yes. Yes, he does.

29:19.722 --> 29:21.755
It's always nice
when they fight for you.

29:21.841 --> 29:25.142
Yeah, it is.

29:32.351 --> 29:34.151
Ah.

29:34.219 --> 29:36.520
Ah, Kevlar, so flattering,

29:36.572 --> 29:39.222
and it breathes, too.

29:39.275 --> 29:41.358
There are a few protesters
in the stands.

29:41.410 --> 29:44.111
Can't they leave
the politics out of baseball?

29:44.196 --> 29:46.864
They're just exercising
their first amendment rights.

29:46.916 --> 29:48.282
Okay. Remember H.W.

29:48.367 --> 29:50.117
No thinking,
just hit the mound and fire.

29:50.202 --> 29:52.402
Yup. Right over
home base.

29:52.454 --> 29:53.837
HENRY and STEVIE:
Home plate.

29:53.906 --> 29:55.005
Plate.

29:55.073 --> 29:57.257
We're ready for you,
Madam President.

30:01.931 --> 30:03.413
Home plate. Home plate.
You got it.

30:08.804 --> 30:10.521
Please welcome to Citi Field,

30:10.589 --> 30:12.272
the President
of the United States,

30:12.358 --> 30:14.107
Elizabeth McCord.

30:14.193 --> 30:17.194
I want to, I want to
back off on the gas tax.

30:17.262 --> 30:19.780
Mom...
There are other ways
to fund the bill.

30:19.865 --> 30:22.432
After all the political
capital you spent

30:22.484 --> 30:24.034
getting the bill
through Congress,

30:24.102 --> 30:26.737
backing off now could be
a major embarrassment.

30:26.789 --> 30:29.072
We're already embarrassed.

30:29.124 --> 30:30.707
Look at them.

30:30.776 --> 30:32.709
Why aren't we listening?

30:32.778 --> 30:35.111
Can we discuss this when
there isn't a stadium crowd

30:35.164 --> 30:37.247
waiting for you?

30:38.634 --> 30:40.834
I can't... I have to go
watch this on my phone.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.053
Sorry.
Okay, honey.

30:43.121 --> 30:46.473
Welcome, Madam President.

30:56.569 --> 30:58.769
Our ceremonial catcher

30:58.821 --> 31:00.904
is Luis Guillorme.

31:18.257 --> 31:20.791
Madam President,
it's your pitch.

31:34.106 --> 31:37.975
Great job, Madam President.

31:42.281 --> 31:44.364
You told the catcher
to move forward.

31:44.450 --> 31:46.016
It's my job to
make her look good.

31:46.068 --> 31:47.901
No, Russell, it's your
job to help her execute

31:47.987 --> 31:49.736
her policies effectively.

31:49.822 --> 31:52.322
You know I respect
the hell out of you, Henry,

31:52.374 --> 31:54.291
but don't tell me
what my job is.

31:54.359 --> 31:55.525
Let me ask you something.

31:55.594 --> 31:58.462
If Conrad wanted
to make a policy change,

31:58.530 --> 31:59.863
would you openly contradict him?

31:59.915 --> 32:01.810
I've got eight years' experience
in the White House...

32:01.834 --> 32:03.028
No, just answer
the question, Russell,

32:03.052 --> 32:05.802
because I see a chief of staff
second-guessing

32:05.871 --> 32:08.204
and micromanaging the
elected leader of this country.

32:08.257 --> 32:10.257
'Cause this isn't like
any other presidency.

32:10.342 --> 32:13.727
Anything that came at Conrad
comes at her twice as hard.

32:13.812 --> 32:16.074
All right? You don't want to
know the threat reports I get,

32:16.098 --> 32:18.214
or what this Congress
is capable of doing to her,

32:18.267 --> 32:20.050
and you won't have to

32:20.102 --> 32:22.185
'cause I'm the one
thinking five steps ahead

32:22.237 --> 32:24.071
to protect her
from the worst of it.

32:24.156 --> 32:27.074
I get that you're trying
to protect her,

32:27.159 --> 32:29.192
I do,

32:29.244 --> 32:32.228
but I think that you and I
and everybody out there

32:32.281 --> 32:33.947
is just gonna have to
take a breath

32:34.033 --> 32:36.950
and find out what it looks like
to have a woman president

32:37.036 --> 32:39.453
by having one,
by letting it happen

32:39.538 --> 32:42.756
and not looking
for the pitfalls.

32:42.841 --> 32:44.708
The country elected her,

32:44.760 --> 32:46.910
and now it's time
to let her lead.

32:46.962 --> 32:51.581
And now, here they are:
Your New York Mets!

32:57.889 --> 32:59.356
Oh, gosh, thanks.

32:59.408 --> 33:01.008
You really don't
have to do this anymore.

33:01.059 --> 33:04.077
I thought you needed it
after your egg white frittata.

33:04.163 --> 33:06.780
With cashew cheese.

33:06.865 --> 33:10.116
Nuts and cheese,
really two different things.
Yes, ma'am.

33:10.202 --> 33:11.785
Congratulations
on the pitch, ma'am.

33:11.870 --> 33:13.932
You'll be happy to know
the Internet loves you again.

33:13.956 --> 33:18.124
A little high and wide, but I
guess I didn't embarrass myself.

33:18.210 --> 33:19.292
Good morning.

33:19.378 --> 33:21.378
Good morning.
It was a solid throw

33:21.430 --> 33:24.747
and full distance
from the mound. Impressive.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.184
He's so nice to me.
It's hard to get used to.

33:27.252 --> 33:30.253
Um...

33:30.305 --> 33:33.356
Daisy, I want to release
a statement this morning

33:33.425 --> 33:37.260
announcing that I'll be looking
into ways to delay or roll back

33:37.312 --> 33:39.262
the gas tax, and then I'm gonna

33:39.314 --> 33:42.315
need an updated list
of proposals

33:42.401 --> 33:46.203
for new revenue streams
to make up the deficit.

33:46.271 --> 33:47.621
Yes?

33:47.706 --> 33:52.325
With respect, Madam President,
giving in to protesters

33:52.411 --> 33:56.746
risks turning your biggest
legislative win into a defeat.

33:56.798 --> 33:58.081
I hear that,

33:58.133 --> 34:01.418
but I don't see how responding
to the objections

34:01.470 --> 34:03.286
of the people
I was elected to serve

34:03.338 --> 34:05.839
makes me weak.

34:05.924 --> 34:07.290
I know we're all

34:07.342 --> 34:09.125
panicked about
the approval rating,

34:09.177 --> 34:12.929
but if throwing a ball
makes people love me again,

34:12.981 --> 34:15.148
then how much
could it really matter?

34:15.234 --> 34:17.467
Well, Conrad didn't
like it, either,

34:17.518 --> 34:20.186
but your approval rating
is how you get things done.

34:20.272 --> 34:22.192
Right now Hanson and his minions
are realizing

34:22.241 --> 34:23.635
they're gonna
have to put off murder

34:23.659 --> 34:24.940
until next week.

34:24.993 --> 34:27.409
It's crude and it's fear-based,

34:27.478 --> 34:29.612
but it works.

34:29.665 --> 34:31.998
Okay. Well, uh...

34:32.083 --> 34:35.085
You might be right
about this one,

34:35.152 --> 34:37.337
but I do want to get to work
on that statement,

34:37.422 --> 34:39.121
please.

34:39.174 --> 34:41.174
- Thank you.
- Thanks, ma'am.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.179
You okay, Russell?

34:48.350 --> 34:50.350
I will be.

34:53.138 --> 34:55.221
Hi. Devon.

34:55.306 --> 34:58.174
Nina Cummings from State.

34:58.226 --> 35:00.321
I called about getting
the docs signed by Mr. Jackson?

35:00.345 --> 35:02.529
Uh, he's in, if you want
to get them signed now.

35:02.614 --> 35:03.697
I'm heading out.

35:03.782 --> 35:06.015
Oh. Well, it can wait
until you get back.

35:06.068 --> 35:08.068
I'm not coming back.

35:08.153 --> 35:10.737
Not that I mind.

35:10.822 --> 35:12.822
Oh.

35:20.749 --> 35:24.918
Unless you're the
president or my wife, go away.

35:29.308 --> 35:30.807
Oh. Excuse me.

35:30.875 --> 35:32.875
Um, State needs your signature.

35:32.928 --> 35:35.228
I'd leave them with
your assistant, but

35:35.314 --> 35:37.564
he left, so...

35:37.649 --> 35:39.716
Fine.

35:39.768 --> 35:42.352
It's better if I do
everything myself anyway.

35:46.692 --> 35:49.242
You know, um,
Devon out there worked

35:49.328 --> 35:51.194
for a Supreme Court justice.

35:51.246 --> 35:52.895
Well, then he should
have figured out

35:52.948 --> 35:54.897
how to answer a phone.

35:54.950 --> 35:57.617
Yeah. Mm.

35:57.703 --> 36:00.236
For a...
legendary gatekeeper,

36:00.288 --> 36:02.288
it's kind of surprising
how little value

36:02.374 --> 36:04.374
you have of your own.

36:05.844 --> 36:08.378
I know it's-it's hard to
replace somebody like Adele,

36:08.430 --> 36:11.214
but if you just give
people a little bit

36:11.266 --> 36:13.299
of time and training,
instead of throwing them all

36:13.385 --> 36:15.418
on the scrap heap at
the first misstep...

36:15.470 --> 36:17.053
You finished?

36:18.106 --> 36:19.922
I'm sorry.

36:19.975 --> 36:22.642
No one else will say it
because they're scared of you.

36:22.728 --> 36:24.644
Not a problem for you, is it?

36:24.730 --> 36:27.263
Ambassador Harriman taught me
not to take crap from anybody.

36:27.315 --> 36:28.598
Fine.

36:28.650 --> 36:30.650
You're hired.

36:32.287 --> 36:34.237
What?

36:34.289 --> 36:36.823
If Harriman liked you,
you're good enough for me.

36:36.908 --> 36:38.742
I'll call the secretary.

36:38.794 --> 36:40.160
Um...

36:40.245 --> 36:42.078
Wow! I mean, I was
really hoping

36:42.130 --> 36:44.130
that it was a tiny
shirt for a gerbil.

36:44.216 --> 36:45.749
Yeah, I mean,
well, there's no need

36:45.801 --> 36:49.252
to patent a tiny shirt,
but a unique item like

36:49.304 --> 36:50.953
the wearable
gerbil display shirt...

36:51.006 --> 36:53.122
It requires the protection
of a U.S. patent.

36:53.175 --> 36:55.141
I see.
What can I say?

36:55.227 --> 36:57.010
Your job is way
more fun than mine.

36:57.095 --> 36:59.629
I don't know. I think your job
is a little more important.

36:59.681 --> 37:00.963
There you go.
Oh, thank you.

37:01.016 --> 37:02.210
That has to
be important.
Well, I guess...

37:02.234 --> 37:03.378
It's important to the person

37:03.402 --> 37:04.818
who invented it.

37:04.903 --> 37:07.437
With this?

37:07.489 --> 37:08.883
What are you...
what are you doing?

37:08.907 --> 37:10.473
I'm just giving this lady
a better shot.

37:14.529 --> 37:16.145
Here, why don't we, uh...?

37:16.198 --> 37:17.530
Let's take our own photo.

37:17.616 --> 37:18.948
An "ussie" if you will.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.917
Oh. Wait.
Should I wear the hat? No?

37:20.985 --> 37:22.252
That's totally up to you.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.003
Tough call. All right,
I'm gonna do it.

37:24.089 --> 37:25.321
Okay.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.424
Oh, yeah, worth it.

37:32.764 --> 37:34.097
Welcome, passengers.

37:34.165 --> 37:36.244
We're just about to begin
boarding for this afternoon's

37:36.268 --> 37:39.018
flight to Dulles
International Airport.

37:43.191 --> 37:45.475
Mr. Barnow, you were saying
you saw your efforts

37:45.527 --> 37:47.393
to cover up the death
of Senator Woodhouse

37:47.479 --> 37:48.945
as part of your duties

37:49.013 --> 37:51.815
as Elizabeth McCord's
campaign manager.

37:51.867 --> 37:53.733
Senator...
I thought that

37:53.819 --> 37:55.663
the death of Senator Woodhouse
was a situation

37:55.687 --> 37:57.704
I needed to manage,
because up to that point,

37:57.789 --> 37:59.267
I was operating
under the assumption

37:59.291 --> 38:01.524
that nothing could be worse
for the McCord campaign

38:01.576 --> 38:05.078
than for this
incredibly powerful, effective

38:05.163 --> 38:08.164
Secretary of State to be seen
as a weak, vulnerable woman.

38:08.216 --> 38:10.834
Then we got to Burlington.

38:10.886 --> 38:14.554
Yeah, I want gender pay equity,
but I want more.

38:14.639 --> 38:17.257
I want a living wage

38:17.342 --> 38:19.175
for every working American.

38:19.227 --> 38:22.929
You know, my father-in-law
raised four kids

38:23.014 --> 38:24.931
on a steelworker's salary.

38:25.016 --> 38:26.883
That just wouldn't be possible
today.

38:26.935 --> 38:28.735
But we will get there,

38:28.820 --> 38:31.154
because every American
deserves that.

38:31.222 --> 38:33.323
Thank you for asking.

38:36.328 --> 38:39.228
Thank you.

38:39.281 --> 38:40.613
Hi, Secretary McCord.

38:40.699 --> 38:42.198
Ginny Matthews.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.416
Hi.

38:43.502 --> 38:45.752
Um...

38:45.837 --> 38:47.921
when I was 16, I got pregnant

38:48.006 --> 38:49.923
and dropped out of high school.

38:50.008 --> 38:52.208
Fortunately,
my mom made me get my GED,

38:52.260 --> 38:54.093
and then I went on
to nursing school

38:54.179 --> 38:55.879
with the help of a few loans.

38:55.931 --> 38:58.414
Um... at the hospital
where I worked,

38:58.466 --> 39:02.218
I saw pain medication
prescribed every day,

39:02.270 --> 39:05.755
and I saw...
what it did to people, so,

39:05.824 --> 39:09.809
a few years ago, when my husband
Howard had to have surgery,

39:09.895 --> 39:11.811
I told him,

39:11.897 --> 39:13.897
"Don't take that stuff."

39:13.949 --> 39:16.983
But he needed help
with the pain, and...

39:17.068 --> 39:19.202
that's what they gave him.

39:23.208 --> 39:25.708
Three years ago, I...

39:27.295 --> 39:30.947
found him...
dead from an overdose.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.799
Um...

39:32.884 --> 39:37.136
Without his salary, I couldn't
keep up with the mortgage, and

39:37.222 --> 39:39.138
last year, I lost my house.

39:39.224 --> 39:42.625
Now I stay with my daughter, but
she can barely afford groceries,

39:42.677 --> 39:45.178
much less medication
for her son's asthma.

39:45.263 --> 39:49.015
I'm not looking for a handout,

39:49.100 --> 39:52.151
and I'll admit
when I screw up, but

39:52.237 --> 39:55.238
I got to tell you,
I'm asking myself, you know...

39:58.276 --> 40:00.076
is this h...

40:00.144 --> 40:02.495
is this how...
how it's supposed to be?

40:12.290 --> 40:14.791
No.

40:14.843 --> 40:17.543
That's not how
it's supposed to be.

40:30.141 --> 40:32.442
<i>We all know what happened next.</i>

40:32.510 --> 40:35.061
<i>By morning, most of the country
had seen that video,</i>

40:35.146 --> 40:37.563
<i>and her polls shot up
six points.</i>

40:37.649 --> 40:40.617
Vulnerability wasn't her
weakness, it was her superpower.

40:40.685 --> 40:42.986
It was in that moment
that I realized

40:43.038 --> 40:44.787
the old playbook meant nothing
anymore.

40:44.856 --> 40:47.573
It's also the moment I might
have believed in politics again.

40:47.659 --> 40:48.908
For, like, a day.

40:52.881 --> 40:54.530
I have the coroner's report

40:54.582 --> 40:56.249
from the Chief
Medical Examiner's office

40:56.334 --> 40:57.417
in Bangor, Maine.

40:57.502 --> 40:58.835
It lists the cause of death

40:58.887 --> 41:02.371
for Senator Woodhouse
as anoxia due to asphyxiation.

41:02.424 --> 41:04.007
Interestingly, the report

41:04.059 --> 41:07.209
declines to rule out foul play.

41:07.262 --> 41:08.845
Can I see that report, please?

41:08.897 --> 41:12.565
I'm sorry. What on
earth are you trying to imply?

41:12.651 --> 41:14.045
Not implying anything,
Mr. Barnow.

41:14.069 --> 41:16.069
I'm laying out the facts
from your own testimony.

41:16.154 --> 41:17.403
You stated

41:17.489 --> 41:19.216
that the loss of Senator
Woodhouse's endorsement

41:19.240 --> 41:21.669
would have been a grave public
embarrassment to the candidate,

41:21.693 --> 41:23.076
one you said multiple times

41:23.161 --> 41:25.061
was your "number one priority"
to avoid.

41:25.113 --> 41:26.507
Seriously?
Senator, that is
an outrageous

41:26.531 --> 41:27.725
accusation founded
on wild speculation.

41:27.749 --> 41:29.832
Are you accusing me of
murder? Are you insane?

41:30.869 --> 41:32.702
Why don't we call
a quick recess?

41:36.758 --> 41:39.092
Are you redecorating?

41:39.177 --> 41:41.678
We cleared things out
for pitching practice.

41:41.746 --> 41:43.412
We're gonna put it
all back tomorrow.

41:43.465 --> 41:44.931
Really?

41:45.016 --> 41:47.266
I was kind of hoping
for a driving range.

41:47.352 --> 41:49.585
Well, here's to a bump
in the approval rating.

41:49.637 --> 41:52.772
All I had to do was publicly
admit I made a mistake.

41:52.857 --> 41:54.223
I wouldn't say

41:54.275 --> 41:55.725
the gas tax was a mistake.

41:55.777 --> 41:57.259
That pitch didn't hurt, either.

41:57.312 --> 41:59.278
Did I hear Scotch?

41:59.364 --> 42:00.930
There are dumplings, too.

42:00.982 --> 42:02.982
Best dorm party ever.

42:04.703 --> 42:07.286
So... how were
the hearings?

42:08.406 --> 42:11.407
I can ask now that it's over.

42:11.459 --> 42:14.077
Anything but.

42:15.413 --> 42:16.629
Forget the Iran hack.

42:16.715 --> 42:18.075
They are looking
into everything.

42:19.501 --> 42:21.217
And if they can't find it,

42:21.285 --> 42:22.719
they will find it anyway.

42:24.422 --> 42:26.339
So,

42:26.424 --> 42:29.008
it's war.
