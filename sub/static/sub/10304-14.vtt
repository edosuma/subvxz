02:21.440 --> 02:23.590
God, l love the girl
in this commercial.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.549
She almost makes me want to try
those feminine hygiene products.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.835
Why don't you start
with a masculine hygiene product.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.077
Like soap.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.550
l just love the way she cartwheels
up and down the beach in that bikini.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.756
Now, that's bouncing.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.710
l mean, that's-- That's acting.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.554
Do you notice anything else
about her?

02:49.960 --> 02:52.599
Nope. Well, yeah, the product works.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.391
She's not cranky.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.353
But why should she be?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.272
Her agent is out getting her jobs...

03:01.480 --> 03:05.109
...while my agent is sitting here,
lusting after girls in commercials.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.749
Hey, l'm doing research, babe.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.597
Then won't you be needing
your blow-up assistant?

03:12.880 --> 03:15.075
Look, Bud.
You start getting me better parts...

03:15.320 --> 03:18.357
...or l'm going to find somebody else
who can, okay?

03:19.280 --> 03:21.316
You can't threaten me.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.950
What do you think?
You think you're my only client?

03:25.280 --> 03:27.271
Perhaps now isn't the best time
to mention...

03:27.520 --> 03:30.478
...I've left him
for the William Morris agency.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.635
Al, even though it only happens
once every 1 0 years...

03:46.880 --> 03:48.836
...why do you insist
on dragging me along...

03:49.080 --> 03:51.389
...when you buy new underwear?

03:52.000 --> 03:55.197
Well, you're the one that's got to
look at them when you wash them.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.799
l don't look at them
and l don't wash them.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.596
l just dry them.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.958
Well, l thought you liked shopping.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.397
Well, l do. But for me.

04:09.640 --> 04:12.200
And you promised
we'd be home in time for Oprah.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.069
Oh, and look. We missed
the opening shot of the audience.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.199
Well, you better hurry, Peg. You're
a box and a half of bonbons behind.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.830
You know how we can avoid
all these problems?

04:24.160 --> 04:26.958
Heartfelt handshake,
we go our separate ways?

04:28.240 --> 04:30.549
No. A satellite dish.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.950
Fine, satellite dish,
go our separate ways.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.078
Al, don't you get it?
lf we had a satellite dish...

04:39.320 --> 04:43.074
...then l could watch Oprah
on East Coast or West Coast time...

04:43.320 --> 04:47.199
...and l wouldn't be a slave
to this Central Time schedule.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.675
So you can fit Oprah
into your busy schedule...

04:50.920 --> 04:53.957
...of loaf, nibble, snore...

04:55.720 --> 04:58.712
...watch, castrate husband...

04:59.640 --> 05:02.279
...loaf, loaf, snore.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.519
l knew you'd see it my way.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.593
Peg, we got over 200 stations
on this cable thing now...

05:08.840 --> 05:10.512
...and all you do all day
is watch TV.

05:10.760 --> 05:14.912
lf we had had the satellite dish,
you'd watch TV all day and all night.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.395
Let's do it, Peg.

05:36.240 --> 05:39.312
You know, Ariel, when l saw you
doing cartwheels in that bikini...

05:39.560 --> 05:40.788
...l said to myself:

05:41.040 --> 05:44.635
'' Now, there is a girl
with an enormous pair of talents...

05:45.360 --> 05:48.352
...that could use--
Could use better representation.''

05:48.600 --> 05:49.828
Do you really think so?

05:50.480 --> 05:53.790
Oh, my God. They talk.

05:56.680 --> 06:01.310
l mean, yeah. That's--
That's why l brought you over here.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.393
See, l think it's time you signed
with a successful agent...

06:04.640 --> 06:06.631
...who'll send your career
to the next level.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.279
lt's tempting...

06:08.520 --> 06:09.999
...but if you're so successful...

06:10.240 --> 06:12.913
...why is your office
in your parents' house?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.749
l cut down on overhead.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.632
See, that way, l can plough all my
profits back to where they should go:

06:22.880 --> 06:24.757
Gifts for you.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.278
Bud, you seem so honest
and sincere.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.715
What do you say
we set up a trial arrangement...

06:30.960 --> 06:35.033
...see how things go,
and seal the deal with some sex?

06:38.120 --> 06:39.394
See--

06:39.640 --> 06:42.108
See, what l had in mind....

06:44.800 --> 06:46.028
What?

06:46.280 --> 06:47.838
Now, are you sure you're good?

06:48.040 --> 06:50.713
Oh, baby, you're gonna know
in about two minutes.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.596
Bud, you are the worst agent
in the entire world...

07:05.840 --> 07:08.354
...and the state of Chicago.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.634
-Kelly?
-How could you send me out...

07:13.840 --> 07:16.274
...on a Depend commercial?

07:21.080 --> 07:23.878
You told me that it was for lingerie.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.988
lt is.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.037
lt's lingerie that...

07:29.280 --> 07:31.157
...absorbs accidents.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.999
Bud, you are fired.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.151
l'm going to find myself a real agent.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.395
l wonder who represents Pocahontas.
She's in everything.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.835
So where were we?

07:49.040 --> 07:51.713
You were about to go
to the refrigerator to get some ice.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.079
lce?

07:54.320 --> 07:57.392
-What for?
-Your black eye.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.628
You just-- You just ruined the
best two minutes of your life.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.358
Boy, is he a train to nowhere.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.838
Peggy...

08:14.560 --> 08:16.596
...l can't believe...

08:18.920 --> 08:23.118
...you convinced Al
to spend $7 00 on a satellite dish...

08:23.360 --> 08:27.399
...when he won't even shell out
3 bucks for deodorant.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.998
Well, in Al's defence...

08:30.240 --> 08:34.916
...unlike deodorant, there's actually
a shot he might use the satellite.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.958
Oh, Marcie, look at this.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.755
Look at all the Oprah specials
you can get on satellite.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.070
The Making of Oprah.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.914
Baking With Oprah.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.670
The Pre-Oprah Show-prah.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.477
Hey, Peg.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.872
Peg.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.398
l was on my way to the store,
l said:

09:02.640 --> 09:06.235
''What am l going to spend $7 00 for
on a thing l can get for $23.95...

09:06.480 --> 09:08.710
...at Crazy Achmed's?''

09:10.800 --> 09:14.793
And Achmed throws in
all the roasted goat you can eat.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.078
No dinner for me tonight, Peg.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.069
Yeah, like you were going to get some.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.515
Back at you, Peg.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.395
Are you sure that's the same quality
satellite as everyone else is selling?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.836
That's why they call him crazy.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.358
Well, that, and because
he also sells plutonium.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.436
Actually, l don't care
where you bought it...

09:39.680 --> 09:42.831
...as long as the installer
hooks it up in time for...

09:43.040 --> 09:47.716
...Andrew Lloyd Webber's
Phantom of the Oprah.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.555
That's the other great news, Peg.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.510
Achmed convinced you that even
a shoe salesman can install it?

09:58.320 --> 10:01.995
He didn't have to.
lt says that right here on the box.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.111
Well, l'm going to go set up
the ladder.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.870
l'm going to set up the funeral.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.795
What are you two laughing about?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.555
You don't think we can get it up?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.796
Scoff all you want, Peg.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.919
But in five minutes,
when l install this dish...

10:37.160 --> 10:40.869
...then you'll be nagging out of
the other side of that couch, Peg.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.636
Five minutes, Peg.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.838
Jefferson, here we go.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.149
Come on. Come on.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.314
This is going to be so much fun.
l feel like a kid at Christmas.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.194
Yeah, well, get ready
to open your present.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.589
Five...

10:56.840 --> 10:58.068
...four...

10:58.320 --> 11:01.312
-...three--
-Watch it, Jefferson!

11:07.720 --> 11:09.119
A little early.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.438
-Five minutes, Peg.
-Al, l'm slipping!

11:24.400 --> 11:26.755
Well, we did it. We did it.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.990
You actually installed the dish?

11:33.240 --> 11:35.834
No, we actually opened the box.

11:41.960 --> 11:46.317
Yeah, we showed those five heavy
staples not to mess with real men.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.714
What's Dumber doing?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.717
He's up there laying the pieces out.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.992
ls that such a good idea
on a pitched roof?

11:59.600 --> 12:02.433
Marcie, l'm sure Al knows
what he's doing.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.877
Hey, Al!
ls everything okay up there?

12:06.120 --> 12:07.872
-Never better. Watch it.
-See what l--

12:14.240 --> 12:15.992
Jefferson?

12:16.560 --> 12:21.031
Jefferson, l heard a shattering sound.
Did the dish break?

12:21.920 --> 12:24.912
No. That was my skull!

12:25.240 --> 12:29.472
Good. Walk it off
and Frisbee the dish back up here.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.516
Sorry, Al.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.957
Mr. D'Arcy, l need some advice.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.838
Kelly fired me as her agent.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.753
lf l don't get her back,
l'll have to go and get a real job.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.639
This is an emergency.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.878
l'm slipping, Jefferson.
Help me, buddy.

13:06.120 --> 13:09.669
Look, Bud, today's agent succeeds
by ripping off what's hot.

13:09.920 --> 13:14.311
So you got to create your own project
and hire Kelly to star in it.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.474
Help me. Help me.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.118
Create my own project.
Now, that's a good idea.

13:23.360 --> 13:27.433
But what kind of--?
What kind of projects?

13:27.680 --> 13:32.515
Jefferson. Jefferson.
l can't feel your hands.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.190
Well, let me think. Something--
Something sexy, something sleazy.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.670
Something l would buy.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.438
Hey, hey, hey. l got it, l got it.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.952
A workout video full of gorgeous babes
jumping up and down.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.713
A workout video? That's perfect.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.793
l'll have Kelly do an exercise video.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.788
Yeah, that would work.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.390
Jefferson. Jefferson.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.592
l'm hanging by my chin here!

14:03.400 --> 14:06.710
All right. l'm gonna go to the bank
right now and get a loan.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.313
Thanks so much, Mr. D'Arcy.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.916
Hey, if l'm one thing,
l'm always there for my friends.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.197
What are Shemp and Curly doing now?

15:16.520 --> 15:19.398
They're measuring the roof.

15:20.160 --> 15:24.995
Okay, Al, l've got the end of the tape.
Now, how far to the edge?

15:25.240 --> 15:26.912
Four feet.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.513
Five feet.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.718
Six feet!

15:40.320 --> 15:41.548
Five and a half feet.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.233
Where are you, Al?

15:45.480 --> 15:48.074
l'm right here, Jefferson.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.593
Five more minutes, Al?

15:56.920 --> 15:59.480
At the outside, Peg.

16:00.680 --> 16:04.195
Well, listen. We're about to put up
the electrical wiring.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.672
So whatever you do, do not watch
the TV. Don't turn it on, Peg.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.752
Okay, Al.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.549
l can't believe it. Every single bank
in Chicago turned me down.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.599
So my faxes got through.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.071
The guy on TV looks just like Dad.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.428
Except this guy's on fire.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.558
Oh, that's cool.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.836
And now a word from our sponsor.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.753
I'm Vito Capone. No relation.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.319
If you're a worthless bum...

16:48.560 --> 16:50.676
... who's been turned down
by every bank...

16:50.920 --> 16:55.072
... then catch the bus or have your
mommy drive you down to Moneyland.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.118
We turn down no one.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.548
So come on by.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.759
We're conveniently located
in the trunk of my car.

17:04.280 --> 17:08.671
So call 1-800-HORSEHEAD.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.477
Horsehead.

17:19.520 --> 17:23.433
Well, Bud, like so many women
have told you before...

17:23.680 --> 17:26.114
...l have found somebody better.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.797
l'm signing with a new agent.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.349
He represents the Bay City Rollers...

17:31.600 --> 17:33.352
...Milli Vanilli...

17:33.600 --> 17:36.478
...the entire Buttafuoco family.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.153
Except Joey.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.231
Oh, that's too bad, Kel.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.233
Just when l needed someone
to be in my new workout video...

17:45.440 --> 17:47.670
...that l'm producing and directing.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.480
Who, oh, who
will l ever get to star in it?

17:51.200 --> 17:53.873
Me, me, me!

17:54.120 --> 17:57.749
Oh, but dash it all,
l don't represent you anymore.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.436
l could re-sign.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.195
Kel, you have made
an excellent decision.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.919
As your agent, l'll work hard...

18:10.160 --> 18:13.994
...because opportunities like this
just don't drop out of the sky.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.433
Hi, Mr. Bundy.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.352
Hey, babes.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.673
ls it...?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.559
ls it cool in here or is it me?

18:46.080 --> 18:47.513
lt's me.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.591
lt's definitely you.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.074
What are these people doing?

18:56.960 --> 18:59.349
Kelly, they're background
dancercisers.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.799
Thanks for the gift.

19:03.040 --> 19:07.079
No one's ever given me panties
filled with potpourri before.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.832
Where did you find them?

19:12.080 --> 19:15.789
-ln the lingerie department at--
-Oh, not the panties, you idiot.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.710
-The girls.
-They found me.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.997
When word got out there was a
Bud Bundy-Moneyland co-production...

19:22.240 --> 19:23.275
...they just came running.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.636
Yeah, but l'm still the star, right?

19:26.880 --> 19:28.711
Would your agent lie to you?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.070
Hello, Mr. Director.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.788
l'm ready for my video.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.108
What is he talking about?

19:38.360 --> 19:40.396
You did an excellent job...

19:40.640 --> 19:43.438
...casting women who will
look longingly at my buttocks...

19:43.680 --> 19:46.990
...as l stretch and bend.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.757
Excuse us, uno pimento.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.149
Okay, who's the lrish guy, huh?

20:05.040 --> 20:06.439
You mean Raphael?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.033
He's another background dancer.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.113
Kelly, l just got him
so he could appeal to the women.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.952
Really?

20:14.160 --> 20:16.469
Would your director lie to you?

20:16.720 --> 20:19.632
Excuse me. Mr. Scorsese?

20:22.160 --> 20:26.153
Just call me by my nickname,
Bud Bundy. Everybody calls me that.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.358
Who is the natural blond?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.316
l don't see one.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.549
That one.

20:34.960 --> 20:40.318
The one who is rudely avoiding
the temptation to stare at me.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.359
Her? That's--

20:42.600 --> 20:46.593
That's Kelly. She's a dancer.
She's nothing. She's garbage.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.276
l just got her
so she could appeal to the men.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.834
Just as long as everyone knows
that Raphael is the star.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.353
Would your producer lie to you?

21:00.680 --> 21:02.716
Bud.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.876
-Mr. Capone.
-Hey.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.519
Welcome.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.557
Nice.

21:08.800 --> 21:13.476
And this is my sister, Kelly,
the collateral we spoke of.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.231
-And that, there, is Rafael.
-You did a good job, Bud.

21:18.480 --> 21:22.268
-This video will make us a lot of money.
-Yeah, you think so?

21:22.520 --> 21:25.512
Would a guy who holds your
life in his hands lie to you?

21:26.880 --> 21:30.589
-Good point.
-So l can expect my video at 5:00?

21:31.120 --> 21:34.635
-l'd stake my life on it.
-Oh, so you read the contract.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.796
What do you mean
that you're the star?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.917
Bud told me that l was the star.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.038
That's funny.
Bud told me you were garbage.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.430
Raphael is the only star.

21:45.760 --> 21:49.230
Well, if l am not the star,
then l am walking.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.310
Oh, yeah? Well, either if Raphael
is not the star, he is walking.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.516
Do not try and stop him.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.358
Don't worry. They'll come around.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.318
You know how temperamental
actors are.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.630
lt may be a week.
May be-- May be a month.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.074
You have until 5.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.679
You got a great sense of humour,
Mr. Capone.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.710
Yes, l do, Bud. Unfortunately...

22:19.960 --> 22:22.520
...Gino, who l'm leaving here
to see you're on time...

22:22.760 --> 22:25.991
...has no sense of humour whatsoever.
Yo, Gino!
