30:30.411 --> 30:32.993
How can you be so determined
seeing us as the enemy...

30:33.164 --> 30:34.995
...instead of working with us?

30:35.500 --> 30:40.039
Okay, let me save you.
You'll never get out.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.082
I know, but it's worth it.

30:42.257 --> 30:47.422
To destroy the single greatest threat
to democracy.

30:48.304 --> 30:53.424
No civilian in this country
should be more powerful than the law.

I guess you'll get your answer.

-Two, one...
-I am man and steel.

I know how much you love the water.

31:45.945 --> 31:48.527
But I couldn't be happier
to have my feet on ground.

31:48.698 --> 31:54.034
Well, just as well. Let's be honest,
undenrvater, you look like a clown ﬁsh.

31:56.539 --> 31:59.872
I guess I should thank you
for uncovering those holding cells.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.126
Part of me wishes
I could have kept on believing...

32:05.131 --> 32:07.622
...in everything I was raised
to believe in.

32:11.512 --> 32:15.630
Don't let an overzealous war hawk
shake your faith in people, Clark.

32:15.850 --> 32:19.342
Your endless optimism is the one thing
I actually like about you.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.058
Did you learn that vocabulary
from Mera?

32:23.733 --> 32:26.896
Seriously, though,
you made a good point.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.983
Digging in our heels and being as extreme
as Slade makes us no better than them.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.742
I'm sorry they got
what they wanted out of the VRA.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.531
How's that?

32:37.705 --> 32:41.163
We didn't exactly rush to sign up,
but we got scared.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.041
We stopped communicating,
we stopped trusting each other.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.413
There's no way we can beat this
if we splinter.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.503
I may not trust the commandos
in Washington...

32:51.803 --> 32:53.043
...but I trust you, Clark.

32:54.514 --> 32:55.754
So we'll do it your way.

32:56.474 --> 33:00.433
Lead by example, not by resistance.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.680
I think you have another battle
brewing on the home front, though.

33:10.363 --> 33:13.730
I thought if I told Lois my secret,
everything would fall into place.

33:15.743 --> 33:18.405
I guess I've kept her on the outside.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.449
The away games don't matter
unless you win the ones at home too...

33:23.626 --> 33:26.993
...which you deﬁnitely can't do
if you refuse to have a co-captain.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.290
What I'm saying is...

33:32.468 --> 33:36.586
...if anyone can handle you
and what you do, it's Lois.

33:37.598 --> 33:41.090
But you can't bring her on the team
and keep her benched.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.761
The question is, can you handle that?

33:52.989 --> 33:55.856
You do carry a lot of baggage.

33:56.617 --> 34:00.360
Seriously, don't make me take
my hair dryer out and shrivel you.

34:01.622 --> 34:06.116
Perhaps I was too hasty
in myjudgment of you, Lois Lane.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.003
You think? Because we didn't just
get off on the wrong ﬁn.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.084
I stand by what I said before.

34:12.258 --> 34:18.128
You're not like us, not like Clark,
but you are what he needs.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.975
You treat Clark not as your superior,
but as an equal.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.635
And insist that he do the same.

34:30.818 --> 34:31.933
Thanks.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.063
You'll make a good partner
for him, Lois.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.363
In your own way.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.196
If he lets me.

34:41.370 --> 34:44.954
It took months and more than
just a few water blasts to the head...

34:45.124 --> 34:49.037
...for Orin to let me stand with him,
not just beside him.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.578
Give Clark time.

I hate to break up the party.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.806

35:03.976 --> 35:06.433
I thought Orin was exaggerating, Clark.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.390
Everything he said about you is true.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.143
Even when the tide is turning...

35:11.317 --> 35:15.651
...you work hard to bring change
by delivering justice, not bombs...

35:17.073 --> 35:20.361
...as a patriot to the country,
not just the cause.

35:49.814 --> 35:54.228
In case I forgot to mention it, I'm really glad
I only booked a one-way to Miami.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.610
Your arms are a lot better
than some seat in coach.

35:57.780 --> 36:01.113
You shouldn't have had to ﬂy
all the way to Florida just to ﬁnd me.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.195
Don't sweat it.

36:03.369 --> 36:05.985
Those mileage points needed
to be used up anyway.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.654
You were right to be upset.

I've been running around
acting like it's just me...

36:11.169 --> 36:12.249
...instead of us.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.131
The truth is, I rely on you
more than anyone else.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.839
I trust you to know parts of me
that I don't even trust myself.

36:25.057 --> 36:29.016
That's why you're the only person I told
about the darkness I've tried to ﬁght...

36:29.896 --> 36:31.261
...and failed.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.645
I know.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.393
It's just when you look
at AC and Mera...

36:35.568 --> 36:38.731
...how they work together,
how alike they are...

36:39.030 --> 36:41.487
...it kind of makes you wonder...

36:41.699 --> 36:43.940
...if we'll ever be like that.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.322
-I mean, you gotta admit, I'm--
-Everything that I'm not?

36:49.415 --> 36:51.030
Lois, that's why it works.

36:51.417 --> 36:54.409
Two pieces may ﬁt,
but if they're not from the same puzzle...

36:54.587 --> 36:56.373
...it might end up like a Picasso.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.378
But does that matter?

36:59.800 --> 37:01.631
Depends.

37:02.511 --> 37:05.548
When you went off
to go and save the world...

37:06.724 --> 37:09.716
...I remember
what my mom looked like...

37:09.894 --> 37:12.806
...every time my dad
left on deployment.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.601
And it was the hardest thing
she ever had to do, but she—

37:17.652 --> 37:21.986
She remained stoic
until that door closed.

37:23.699 --> 37:27.942
Because she knew that was how she helped
my dad do what he had to do.

37:29.372 --> 37:34.537
Because they were in it together,
no matter what.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.126
And so am I.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.045
But I'm not the only one.

37:45.388 --> 37:50.928
You didn't tell anyone
about the darkness because...

37:51.894 --> 37:56.684
...you think you're supposed
to be invincible, right?

What's going on?

39:13.768 --> 39:15.053

We all know
what the government was up to...

39:19.982 --> 39:22.143
...but those prisons were part
of a much bigger threat.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.441
Hate crimes are up.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.228
People like Slade
are getting more control.

39:27.406 --> 39:31.866
And Godfrey's anti-vigilante message,
it's reaching more ears than ever before...

39:32.036 --> 39:34.197
...and I don't think it's a coincidence.

39:34.372 --> 39:38.741
Sadly, Clark, there's no mystery
to human fear and hatred.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.542
This time, there might be.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.498
There's something
behind the darkness.

39:43.672 --> 39:47.085
Something that hero haters like Slade
don't know is affecting them.

39:47.259 --> 39:50.387
When I sent the Kandorians away
through the portal, in space...

39:50.554 --> 39:53.045
...I opened a door for something
to come to Earth.

39:53.224 --> 39:57.342
Are you telling me that out of all
the intergalactic bad boys we've faced...

39:57.520 --> 39:59.476
...this one's actually worse?

39:59.647 --> 40:02.514
This is much worse.
We can't even see it to ﬁght it.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.897
This thing is like an evil
that's spreading over the Earth.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.107
It preys upon the dark side
that we have.

40:09.281 --> 40:12.944
It feeds on our doubts, our fears,
and our distrust.

40:14.203 --> 40:17.695
I'd say from where I'm standing,
it's already on the winning side.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.663
I think it even infected Slade.

40:22.128 --> 40:26.497
Just before the facility exploded,
I saw something on Slade's skull:

40:26.799 --> 40:27.959
the omega symbol.

40:28.342 --> 40:31.300
It was like it was branded there,
almost like the mark--

40:31.470 --> 40:33.335
Of the beast in Revelations.

40:34.348 --> 40:37.055
Which would explain
why he veered so far off his orders.

40:37.226 --> 40:40.810
You don't think Slade's the only pledge
to the Alpha Omega Die fraternity.

40:41.397 --> 40:44.139
I think the omega's a sign
of corruption.

40:44.316 --> 40:46.898
A mark that the darkness
has fully taken over someone.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.816
Didn't Kara say that a person
had to be open to the darkness?

40:50.990 --> 40:53.402
That it can't infect anyone
of pure heart?

40:53.576 --> 40:56.443
And which one of us
doesn't have that weakness?

40:56.620 --> 40:59.453
A hidden hatred or fear
that this thing couldn't prey upon?

40:59.874 --> 41:02.661
So basically,
this thing doesn't have to do anything.

41:02.835 --> 41:05.121
It just waits
for everybody's weaknesses...

41:05.296 --> 41:07.662
...and then we destroy ourselves.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.043
If we can't stop it...

41:10.217 --> 41:13.630
...the darkness will infect every person
on this planet.
