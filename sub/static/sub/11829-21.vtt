00:02.435 --> 00:05.300
???

00:05.335 --> 00:06.500
If I get the job,

00:06.535 --> 00:08.800
the first paycheck I get is
going straight to the attorney.

00:08.835 --> 00:11.000
Gonna take you down to Boykewich's Butchers

00:11.035 --> 00:12.400
and let you get your hands dirty.

00:12.435 --> 00:14.700
And just so you know,
I'm gonna offer a job to Ricky.

00:14.735 --> 00:16.900
It would be good if you
two could work together.

00:16.935 --> 00:18.400
You mugged me, took the money,

00:18.435 --> 00:20.500
and then you hit me in the head with a box.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.800
I don't believe it.

00:21.835 --> 00:23.800
The loan went through. The house e ine.

00:23.835 --> 00:26.500
The only person I should worry
about getting on my side is you.

00:26.535 --> 00:28.200
I want Amy to keep the baby.

00:28.235 --> 00:31.400
Do you really think I
don't care about my baby?

00:31.435 --> 00:33.900
You care enough to take care
of the baby before he's born,

00:33.935 --> 00:35.900
but not enough to take
care of him after that?

00:35.935 --> 00:37.300
How much you going to pay me?

00:37.335 --> 00:39.100
Let's go grab dinner and talk.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.700
Here's what the church can offer.

00:40.735 --> 00:41.900
A job in the daycare center.

00:41.935 --> 00:44.700
You could teach little kids music
they'd pay you for that.

00:44.735 --> 00:46.600
And we can babysit for you.

00:46.635 --> 00:49.100
Adrian volunteered to throw
the baby shower at her house.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.300
Right. I know that you want to keep it.

00:51.335 --> 00:53.900
I think that you could do it,
but it's not gonna be easy.

00:53.935 --> 00:55.500
I know that I can be a good mom

00:55.535 --> 00:57.900
because I' the best mom
in the whole world.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.600
- Hello?
- Hi, Adrian. It's Grace.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.000
Why didn't you call me???

01:11.035 --> 01:13.200
- Are you expecting a call?
- No.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.200
Your brother still hasn't called you?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.100
- No.
- Oh.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.000
- He'll call.
- Yeah, I know, he will.

01:19.035 --> 01:19.800
He'll call.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.000
I don't need your pity.

01:21.035 --> 01:22.200
I'm not pitying you.

01:22.235 --> 01:24.700
???need any help with the shower.

01:24.735 --> 01:25.500
No.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.600
When is that?

01:26.800 --> 01:28.100
Adrian, it's tomorrow.

01:28.135 --> 01:31.300
Ugh. Yeah, okay. I'll--
I'll get some chips and dip.

01:31.335 --> 01:32.300
I got a present already.

01:32.335 --> 01:35.500
Chips and dip?
What about petit fours?

01:35.535 --> 01:37.400
Individual quichAB? Punch?

01:37.435 --> 01:39.700
As in "I'll punch you if
you make another suggestion"?

01:39.735 --> 01:40.800
We don't need all that stuff.

01:40.835 --> 01:43.000
Okay, well, what games do you have plan?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
Games?

01:44.235 --> 01:45.800
Have you ever been to a baby shower?

01:45.835 --> 01:47.500
I'm in the 10th grade.

01:47.535 --> 01:49.600
Pardon me if I'm new at this.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.500
Do you want a quinceañera? I can help.

01:51.535 --> 01:52.800
Is that spicy?

01:52.835 --> 01:54.000
???

01:54.500 --> 01:57.000
Grace, it's just a bunch of girls coming over.

01:57.035 --> 01:58.600
Okay, I'll bring the refreshments.

01:58.635 --> 02:00.400
Fine. Who's coming?

02:00.500 --> 02:02.200
You didn't send out the invitations?

02:02.235 --> 02:04.400
Uh, you gave me invitations.

02:04.435 --> 02:06.100
You didn't tell me who to send them to.

02:06.135 --> 02:08.800
Ay dios mio, girl.
I'm coming over there.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.500
Yeah, whatever.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.200
You can come over here to yell at me,

02:12.235 --> 02:13.700
but you can't come over here to visit?

02:13.735 --> 02:16.700
I told my mother that maybe
I didn't get invited the shower

02:16.735 --> 02:19.200
because I hadn't been a good
friend to you all this time.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.400
- So now can I come?
- Of course.

02:22.435 --> 02:24.700
- Me?
- If you want. I guess.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.500
You guess?

02:26.535 --> 02:28.400
I'll call Adrian.
I'm sure it was an oversight.

02:28.435 --> 02:29.200
Really?

02:29.235 --> 02:31.700
Didn't have anything to do
with what we said about Ben?

02:31.735 --> 02:32.500
Madison.

02:32.535 --> 02:34.500
We don't think he's pretentious.

02:34.535 --> 02:36.100
We don't care if he has a driver.

02:36.135 --> 02:38.000
Right. He-- He's a great guy.

02:38.035 --> 02:40.500
Yeah, and we don't care
that he's taken you away from us,

02:40.535 --> 02:42.700
or that you love him more than you do us.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.900
We don't feel like you've
tossed us away at all.

02:44.935 --> 02:47.700
Madison, I didn't know you
felt that way about Ben.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.200
Until now.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.400
My point is that we don't.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.900
I'm not the one who called her a harlot. Twice.

02:56.935 --> 02:58.500
That was Henry,
and I think he just said that

02:58.535 --> 03:00.900
because he's sexually
frustrated and irritable.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.600
All I ever said was
that she bamboozled you

03:03.635 --> 03:06.300
and she doesn't even know I said that.

03:07.900 --> 03:08.900
Unless you told her.

03:08.935 --> 03:10.100
I didn't tell her anything.

03:10.135 --> 03:11.700
I don't know why you didn't get an invite.

03:11.735 --> 03:12.900
Maybe you should call Adrian.

03:12.935 --> 03:15.700
Why? Adrian doesn't decide who
gets invited and who doesn't.

03:15.735 --> 03:16.900
Amy decides who gets invited,

03:16.935 --> 03:19.200
and clearly she decided not to invite me.

03:19.235 --> 03:21.100
You want me to call Amy
and get you an invitation?

03:21.135 --> 03:23.300
No, they probably just forgot to call me.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.000
I'll go anyway.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.400
Oh.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.400
Hey, by the way, are any mothers
invited to the shower tomorrow?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.800
Yeah. Amy.

03:36.900 --> 03:40.000
No, I mean, any grandmothers? Aunts?

03:40.100 --> 03:41.200
I hope not.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.000
I can't believe they didn't invite me.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.900
It's probably because of your
father and Adrian's mother.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.400
What about Grace's mom?

03:49.600 --> 03:50.700
Look, I don't know what you're thinking,

03:50.735 --> 03:53.300
but I think it's just
for Amy and her friends.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.400
- Okay.
- Okay?

03:55.600 --> 03:56.600
Okay.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.000
Hi, can I have the number
for Dr. and Mrs. Bowman?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.200
George?

04:14.300 --> 04:15.700
No. Anne.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Oh. Hi, Anne.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.500
What a nice surprise.

04:19.535 --> 04:21.700
And it wouldn't be a surprise
if George were calling?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.700
You're a nice surprise.
He would be a bad surprise.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.300
I'm just gonna come right
out and ask you this--

04:28.335 --> 04:29.900
He only came here once,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.700
and it was to try to get Marshall and
me to help him get rid of Ricky's father.

04:32.735 --> 04:35.300
That's not what I was gonna ask,
but that's interesting.

04:35.335 --> 04:37.800
Are there any mothers invited
to Amy's shower tomorrow?

04:37.835 --> 04:38.800
Let me ask Grace.

04:38.835 --> 04:40.500
Grace, it's-- It's Anne, Amy's mom.

04:40.535 --> 04:42.200
Is she invited to the baby shower?

04:42.235 --> 04:44.600
- Mm-hm.
- Oh. Am I invited?

04:44.635 --> 04:46.000
Is Adrian's mom coming?

04:46.035 --> 04:46.900
Oh, yeah, is she?

04:46.935 --> 04:48.400
She's working, but you're invited.

04:48.435 --> 04:51.000
Everyone's invited. Adrian
didn't get invites out in time.

04:51.035 --> 04:53.300
Oh. We're invited.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.200
Great.

04:54.235 --> 04:56.700
- So I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.100
Thirsty?

05:24.200 --> 05:25.300
Good morning.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.200
Good morning.

05:26.235 --> 05:27.900
For you and for me.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.700
- Oh, George, don't tell me...
- It's true, Anne.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.400
- You're moving?
- I am.

05:32.435 --> 05:35.800
Oh, George, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

05:35.835 --> 05:36.900
So you're going to miss me, huh?

05:36.935 --> 05:38.200
Oh, I will, I promise.

05:38.235 --> 05:40.100
Do you have any other boxes?
Want me to help you?

05:40.135 --> 05:41.300
I have plenty of boxes

05:41.335 --> 05:42.800
and I have a truck coming later.

05:42.835 --> 05:44.500
Today? You're moving out today?

05:44.535 --> 05:45.100
I am.

05:45.135 --> 05:46.500
- Do the girls know?
- Yep.

05:46.535 --> 05:47.900
Oh, so once again...

05:47.935 --> 05:49.300
You're last to know.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.300
Well, I don't care.

05:50.335 --> 05:52.200
The good news makes up for the timing.

05:52.235 --> 05:54.100
- I'll be around.
- Call first.

05:54.135 --> 05:55.200
You too.

05:55.235 --> 05:56.400
Why didn't you tell me?

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
I didn't know I was gonna
get the keys until yesterday.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.900
Oh, where are you going?

06:00.400 --> 06:01.600
I'll let you know.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.800
I don't care. The point is you're going.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.700
Yes!

06:08.600 --> 06:10.200
Oh. He told you.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.300
He did.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.000
Good. So now you know.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.400
- So where's he moving?
- That I don't know.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.400
I bet it's that house that's
next to Taco Taco Taco.

06:18.435 --> 06:20.500
I just noticed that it
went from sale to lease.

06:20.535 --> 06:21.700
He loves that house.

06:21.735 --> 06:24.100
He loves the idea of being able
to walk across the driveway

06:24.135 --> 06:26.100
to go get a burrito any time, day or night.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.700
If that house had been for
sale when we bought this,

06:28.735 --> 06:29.900
we'd be living there now.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
- Uh-huh.
- So anyway,

06:31.035 --> 06:33.700
need a drive to get Amy a
present or did you get one?

06:33.735 --> 06:35.300
Wait, what are we talking about?

06:35.335 --> 06:36.400
The baby shower?

06:36.435 --> 06:39.400
Oh. That. Yeah, I wasn't invited.

06:39.435 --> 06:40.600
Oh, you're going.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.200
- Why?
- Why?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.900
Because you're Amy's sister.

06:43.935 --> 06:46.200
You're gonna be Aunt Ashley,
and don't forget,

06:46.235 --> 06:48.300
you were the one who
begged her to keep the baby.

06:48.335 --> 06:51.000
So now you get over there and
support her decision to keep the baby,

06:51.035 --> 06:53.700
and you do that by writing
down every gift she gets,

06:53.735 --> 06:54.700
writing down who gave it to her,

06:54.735 --> 06:57.100
and their address so she
can send a thank-you note.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.500
And please pretend to like everyone there.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.200
Okay, and that will fulfill my obligation
as aunt for the child's lifetime?

07:04.500 --> 07:05.800
That's just the beginning.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.700
Hey.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.600
You gonna be okay with him moving?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.000
I know you're gonna miss him.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.200
Maybe.

07:36.235 --> 07:37.500
You know, before he goes,

07:37.535 --> 07:39.800
you might want to ask him for
some money for Amy's present.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.800
Dad, I'm eight-and-a-half months pregnant.

07:52.835 --> 07:55.200
I'm a little irritable.
Tell me what you're saying.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.600
All right, all right. I just
don't want your mother to overhear.

07:58.700 --> 08:02.400
I was saying, if you want,
you can come and live with me.

08:02.435 --> 08:04.000
You and the baby. I mean,
there's plenty of room.

08:04.035 --> 08:05.800
I'm gonna build a nursery either way.

08:05.835 --> 08:07.500
I think we'll be fine here.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.400
And I think I'm gonna need help from Mom.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.500
All right.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.400
You need comic relief,
you know where to find me.

08:12.435 --> 08:14.500
Yeah, and Mom should
know where to find you too.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.200
I'll tell her when I want to tell her,

08:16.235 --> 08:17.500
when she needs to know.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.300
Why do we keep hiding things from Mom?

08:19.335 --> 08:22.100
It's fun and she reacts badly to everything,

08:22.135 --> 08:25.100
and it's practice for the other things I
gotta keep from her when I move out of here.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.400
Hey.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.700
Uh, what do you want for your shower gift?

08:28.735 --> 08:30.400
That should be pretty easy, Ashley.

08:30.435 --> 08:32.100
I don't have anything for the baby.

08:32.135 --> 08:33.700
I have one pair of overalls.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.200
Okay. So no overalls, then.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.600
What about a pony? You want a pony?

08:37.635 --> 08:39.600
- I got a big yard.
- I want a pony.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.500
I wanted to get you a pony,
but your mother hates ponies.

08:41.534 --> 08:44.600
???
motorcycles, cigars, hot tubs.

08:44.635 --> 08:46.600
All the stuff that's
gonna be at the new house.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.100
Maybe we are invited.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.000
Maybe Adrian just forgot to call us too.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.100
She forgot to call Alice. Alice is going.

08:57.135 --> 08:57.900
Maybe we're gonna get the call.

08:57.935 --> 08:59.500
I don't think we're getting the call.

08:59.535 --> 09:01.500
I don't think guys are
invited to these things.

09:01.535 --> 09:04.900
That's old school, man.
Guys-- Guys go to baby showers.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.200
Oh. Wait.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
Maybe Ricky's invited,

09:07.535 --> 09:09.400
and it would be awkward
if you're invited too.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.300
But awkward or not,

09:10.335 --> 09:12.000
if Ricky's gonna be there,
you have to be there.

09:12.035 --> 09:14.700
I don't think Ricky's invited either,

09:14.735 --> 09:18.400
but even if he is, well, it's not my baby.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.900
It's your Amy.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.400
What are we gonna do? Nothing?

09:34.500 --> 09:35.400
Hey, it's me.

09:35.435 --> 09:36.900
I can be there in a half an hour.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.200
Oh, can you?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.400
I'm not looking for that.

09:39.435 --> 09:40.600
I'm looking for that.

09:40.635 --> 09:44.100
I'm calling to see if you have anyone
who should be invited to Amy's shower.

09:44.200 --> 09:49.000
Your mom, aunt, stepsister, foster sisters.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.100
Anyone you know who would come?

09:51.135 --> 09:52.100
When is it?

09:52.200 --> 09:53.200
This afternoon.

09:53.235 --> 09:55.400
Yeah, well, thanks for
letting my family know.

09:55.435 --> 09:57.000
I didn't let anyone's family know.

09:57.035 --> 09:59.000
- Do you know anyone or not?
- Not.

09:59.035 --> 10:01.300
Oh, come on, we're trying
to get swag for your son.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.400
I'm working, I'll buy him what he needs.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.000
Babies need a lot of stuff. A lot.

10:06.035 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, yeah, I know. Thanks for calling.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.400
Ricky.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.400
You left your clothes in the dryer. Again.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.400
I took them out so the rest
of us can do our laundry done.

10:18.435 --> 10:19.500
Sorry. Thanks.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.200
I was vacuuming,
I didn't hear the buzzer.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.200
You know what I heard at work yesterday?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.700
Uh, that Amy's keeping the baby.

10:27.735 --> 10:28.500
Yeah.

10:28.535 --> 10:30.700
I heard that at work instead of from you.

10:30.735 --> 10:31.800
That's why I'm working.

10:31.835 --> 10:34.000
She's keeping the baby
and I'm gonna help out.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.900
Well, I guess you better start
baby-proofing this room down here.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.400
You know, it's the only area in the
whole house that's not baby-proofed.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.500
The baby's not gonna be here.
The baby's gonna be with Amy.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.600
Oh, really. Every day for
the rest of his life?

10:47.635 --> 10:48.900
He's never gonna be here?

10:48.935 --> 10:50.300
I don't think so. No.

10:50.335 --> 10:53.200
I don't think anyone's gonna be
comfortable with me babysitting.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.000
Are you comfortable babysitting?

10:56.035 --> 10:58.600
Are you going to be
comfortable being with your son?

10:58.635 --> 11:00.200
What? I'm gonna touch my own kid?

11:00.235 --> 11:01.600
Just because I was abused,

11:01.635 --> 11:05.000
doesn't mean I would ever,
ever do anything to my son.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.400
I know that.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.200
I just wanna make sure that you know that.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.100
I know it, but it doesn't matter.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.100
I think Ben's gonna be
more like the father.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.800
Think again.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.200
I doubt Ben knows how to do laundry.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.000
I doubt Ben knows

11:21.035 --> 11:24.800
how to make a meal out of whatever
is left in the refrigerator.

11:24.835 --> 11:27.700
I doubt if Ben knows to check
that the doors are locked

11:27.735 --> 11:29.700
before everybody goes to bed at night.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.900
I doubt if Ben can even drive,

11:32.700 --> 11:36.500
or find an all-night pharmacy
when someone is sick.

11:37.300 --> 11:42.600
I doubt if Ben can even take
care of anyone, even himself.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.500
But you have been taking care
of yourself for a long time.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.800
I mean, you even help me with
all these kids in and out of here.

11:50.900 --> 11:54.200
I wish that you didn't have
to take care of your son

11:54.235 --> 11:56.900
and be in high school at the same time,

11:56.935 --> 12:00.900
???

12:02.300 --> 12:03.400
you are.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.700
The girls are having a
baby shower for Amy today.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.800
Oh, and I wasn't invited, of course.

12:10.835 --> 12:12.200
Well, do you wanna go?

12:12.300 --> 12:14.000
Nah, I don't think so.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.400
But you know what?

12:17.600 --> 12:19.500
I'm gonna buy you something.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.900
You're the father.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.900
You're gonna be needing things too.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.100
Is it over yet?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.800
You just gotta get into it.

12:41.835 --> 12:43.900
Yeah, Adrian, it's gonna be a great party.

12:43.935 --> 12:45.600
Hey, I hope you don't mind,
I invited Shawna.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.900
What'd she say? She say yes?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.300
I had to talk her into it.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.700
And how'd you do that, Jack?

12:50.735 --> 12:52.100
How'd you talk her into it?

12:52.135 --> 12:54.100
It doesn't matter.
We're happy to have her.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.700
How'd you make out with the phone list?

12:56.800 --> 12:59.600
I haven't called anyone except for Ricky.

12:59.635 --> 13:01.700
You didn't call anyone
after I left last night?

13:01.735 --> 13:03.900
I'll call them. Jeez.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.100
I'm excited to meet Shawna.

13:07.135 --> 13:08.300
What time you dropping her off?

13:08.335 --> 13:09.300
Dropping her off?

13:09.335 --> 13:11.600
No guys are coming. It's a baby shower.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.200
- So?
- So it's for girls. Only.

13:14.235 --> 13:16.500
I wish I would have know that
before I rented a helium tank

13:16.535 --> 13:18.100
and blew up these balloons for you.

13:18.135 --> 13:20.200
Oh, come on, we're friends.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.900
You don't mind blowing up
a few balloons for me, do you?

13:23.600 --> 13:25.700
You're not flirting with me, are you?

13:26.300 --> 13:28.800
Do you want me to be flirting with you?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Depends on whether or not
you're still in love with Ricky.

13:31.035 --> 13:32.800
Ricky is about to become a father.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.300
I think we have to settle for just being friends.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.700
Sometimes when you're friends with the person

13:37.735 --> 13:40.400
it lasts longer than when you're
in a relationship with them.

13:40.700 --> 13:45.000
I don't now, or never wanted
to be just friends with you.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.400
So how serious are you about Shawna?

13:50.435 --> 13:52.500
I'm serious about her. Yeah.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.900
Grace, Shawna and I--

13:54.300 --> 13:55.500
None of my business.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.300
If it's just a girls' party,

13:57.335 --> 13:59.300
I don't think I'll come
with Shawna after all.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.200
Okay.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.500
Well, uh, if you don't need anything else...

14:02.600 --> 14:05.200
No. I think we've got
everything we need.

14:08.700 --> 14:09.800
All right, look.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.800
I know I shouldn't ask,
but I'm gonna anyway:

14:12.835 --> 14:16.700
Did you really need balloons
or did you just want to see me?

14:16.800 --> 14:19.700
No, we-- We really needed balloons.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.000
Balloons are fun.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.800
And I-- I wanted to see you.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.700
Hi, this is Adrian from school.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.400
The majorette?

14:47.700 --> 14:48.900
Yeah, that one.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.300
I'm giving Amy a baby shower today,
do you want to come?

14:52.900 --> 14:54.900
She's the pregnant girl in the band.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.100
Yeah, all right, whatever.

14:57.135 --> 14:58.400
Hey, this is Adrian.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.800
I need you to do me a favor.

14:59.835 --> 15:02.400
I need you to come to
Amy's baby shower today.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.500
So? I've slept with other
girls' boyfriends, so what?

15:05.700 --> 15:07.100
Hi, it's Adrian.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.000
Look, I'm having a party this
afternoon, you want to come?

15:11.700 --> 15:13.500
No, it's not that kind of party.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.200
I need some help with the phone calls.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.200
Hey-- Did you say something?

15:29.300 --> 15:30.500
Yeah, I said--

15:31.000 --> 15:32.500
Why do you look like that?

15:32.800 --> 15:33.500
Like what?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.600
I know that look.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.200
What look?

15:37.235 --> 15:39.300
The flushed-in-the-face,
messed-up hair look.

15:39.335 --> 15:40.700
Oh, no, that's, um--

15:40.735 --> 15:42.800
That's just because we
were blowing up balloons.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.700
Where are the balloons?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.300
I thought we tied them--

15:50.000 --> 15:51.900
We meant-- We meant to tie them.

15:51.935 --> 15:54.700
Well, you must have had your
hands full with something else.

15:54.735 --> 15:56.600
Yeah, they must have blown away.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.100
- I can't believe it.
- What a shame.

15:59.135 --> 16:01.500
After Jack came over
to help us and everything,

16:01.535 --> 16:03.200
He worked so hard on that.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.200
Yeah.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.700
Okay, you're gonna have to call some people.

16:05.735 --> 16:07.100
People don't like me. No one's coming.

16:07.135 --> 16:08.800
Okay. Give me the phone list.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.100
Hey, Marilyn?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.200
Hey, it's Grace Bowman. How are you?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.200
How's the new puppy?

16:21.300 --> 16:23.600
Oh, I can't wait to see him.
I bet he's so cute.

16:23.635 --> 16:25.100
You have to bring him over.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.600
You know, my brother loves dogs,

16:26.635 --> 16:29.300
and we were thinking a sasquatch
is the perfect breed for him.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.200
Hey, listen, I know this
is totally last-minute,

16:31.235 --> 16:33.200
and it's kind of a spontaneous event,

16:33.235 --> 16:36.000
but Adrian and I are throwing
a baby shower for Amy--

16:36.400 --> 16:37.100
Uh-huh.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.100
Uh-huh.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.000
Uh-huh.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.200
Aw, okay. Thank you.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.400
And I can't wait to see the puppy. Bye.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.400
She has an orthodontist appointment.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.200
But I am sure there are plenty of girls

16:50.235 --> 16:52.300
who don't have orthodontist
appointments who would love to come.

16:52.335 --> 16:55.200
So I'll make the calls,
I'll get girls over here.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.700
It's gonna be a beautiful afternoon.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.400
He'll call.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.800
Your brother?

17:01.900 --> 17:02.700
He'll call.

17:02.735 --> 17:04.200
I don't care about him.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.000
It was a stupid idea to go out
with him in the first place,

17:07.099 --> 17:08.599
and I hate all that romance stuff.

17:08.635 --> 17:11.200
I mean, the flowers and the
teddy bears and everything?

17:12.400 --> 17:13.800
It was all jusCFe.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.099
He's cheating.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.599
Jack doesn't want me to
go to the baby shower.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.400
He's totally cheating on me.

17:27.435 --> 17:29.700
Let's not mix business with pleasure.

17:29.735 --> 17:30.700
He's not cheating on me,

17:30.735 --> 17:32.600
I don't want to know about cheating on you.

17:32.635 --> 17:33.500
Yes, you do.

17:33.535 --> 17:34.400
I'm your sister.

17:34.435 --> 17:36.300
And you don't like guys who cheat on me.

17:36.335 --> 17:39.300
Aw, Shawna. They always
end up cheating on you.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.100
That's just guys. Guys cheat.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.300
And what do we do???

17:43.335 --> 17:46.000
No. Nope. You're not going there again.

17:46.035 --> 17:50.500
I am going to kick that 16-year-old Romeo
to the curb and run over him.

17:50.535 --> 17:52.100
You have no proof.

17:52.135 --> 17:54.200
I know when a guy's cheating on me.

17:54.235 --> 17:56.200
Just like you know when
a guy's in love with you?

18:06.900 --> 18:08.900
Yes, I'm free tonight.
You wanna go out?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.700
- I need your help.
- Anytime.

18:10.735 --> 18:12.500
I need guests for Amy's shower.

18:12.535 --> 18:15.100
It's today at 3 at Adrian's. Girls only.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.000
I'm on it.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.100
Hi, we haven't been formally introduced yet.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.600
I'm Joe Hampton

18:26.635 --> 18:29.600
and I can tell you anything you
want to know about anyone here

18:29.635 --> 18:32.900
at Grant High School in
exchange for a very small favor.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.500
I can't tell her. You tell
her. She can tell me no.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.800
No, she can't, Ash.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.100
And she's gonna get upset,

18:41.135 --> 18:42.400
and then she's gonna be fine with it,

18:42.700 --> 18:45.000
just like she was when I toldr I want
She told you she wanted a divorce.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.600
????

18:46.635 --> 18:48.400
You didn't tell her you wanted one.

18:48.435 --> 18:50.000
Yeah, that was the story
when I was in the garage.

18:50.035 --> 18:52.200
Now that we're moving,
I asked for the divorce.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.000
The man has to take the blame.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.300
- Because?
- Because that's what a man does.

18:57.335 --> 18:59.600
He accepts that everything
is his fault. I accept that.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.800
But it's not your fault.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.800
What about Adrian's mom?

19:03.400 --> 19:06.300
CF, yeah.
So it is your fault.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.500
That's what I'm saying.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.500
I love you, Ash,
and we're all gonna be fine.

19:10.535 --> 19:11.900
Everything's gonna be fine.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.400
Just tell her.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.300
Early. I hate early.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.800
I couldn't call you.
Ruben talked to my dad.

19:26.835 --> 19:28.200
They took my cell phone.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.900
He knows you've called a hundred times,

19:29.935 --> 19:31.600
??Td he said if I didn't break this off,

19:31.635 --> 19:33.900
he and my dad would send me
to military school this summer.

19:33.935 --> 19:36.100
He really, really doesn't want me to see you.

19:36.135 --> 19:37.700
So you're here because...?

19:37.735 --> 19:39.700
Obviously, I don't want to
go to military school,

19:39.735 --> 19:40.900
I'd have to cut my hair,

19:41.300 --> 19:42.000
but...

19:43.100 --> 19:44.000
I miss you.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.900
I like what you've done with the place.

19:50.935 --> 19:53.300
I'm giving Amy a baby shower.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
The pregnant girl.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.800
Yeah, I know. Your boyfriend's one-night stand.

19:57.835 --> 19:59.100
He's not my boyfriend.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.300
Should I open that?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.200
I don't know.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.700
The timing doesn't seem right.
I think I'll just--

20:10.400 --> 20:11.800
We only have a half-hour.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.900
- I'll come back.
- No, no.

20:14.700 --> 20:15.600
This'll be fun.

20:16.100 --> 20:16.800
I don't know, Adrian.

20:16.835 --> 20:19.100
I'd like to have more than a half an hour.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.100
I mean, after all, this is your first time.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.600
Didn't you reclaim your virginity?

20:24.635 --> 20:27.000
Oh, no. I never really made that commitment.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.500
We can wait till later.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.200
You risked military school to come over here.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.400
I am not gonna let you go off to
war without something to remember me by.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.400
Hey, Jack, come on in.

20:42.435 --> 20:43.700
Hey, bro. What up, dog?

20:43.735 --> 20:45.400
You don't have to do that, man.

20:45.435 --> 20:47.600
In fact, don't do that.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.200
Question:

20:49.700 --> 20:51.300
You're not cheating on my sister, are you?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.600
What? No, why would you
think I'm cheating on Shawna?

20:53.635 --> 20:55.700
No, I wa???
No. Shawna's thinking that.

20:55.735 --> 20:56.500
Why?

20:56.535 --> 20:58.300
That girl has a nose for cheating.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.700
She got it through experience.

20:59.735 --> 21:02.500
She could start her own business:
Cheaters, Incorporated.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.200
She's a cheat savant.

21:04.235 --> 21:05.500
All right, well, I'm not cheating on her.

21:05.535 --> 21:06.700
I'm a liar savant.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.900
And you, my mentor and friend,

21:09.500 --> 21:10.400
are lying.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.700
I am not.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.100
And where's Shawna? We need to talk.

21:13.135 --> 21:15.400
She's on her way to the
baby shower to meet the slut.

21:16.000 --> 21:16.800
Which one?

21:16.835 --> 21:17.800
The one that you've been with.

21:17.835 --> 21:20.000
She went to the shower alone?
Why would she do that?

21:20.035 --> 21:21.100
She doesn't know anybody.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
Weren't you listening?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.100
Said she's going to meet the slut.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.500
She doesn't need you for that.

21:25.535 --> 21:28.500
I't cheating, and she's not going there to,

21:28.535 --> 21:30.400
you know, cause a scene
or something, is she?

21:30.435 --> 21:32.500
No, Shawna's got class.

21:32.535 --> 21:34.200
The scene is gonna be when she finds you.

21:34.235 --> 21:37.200
This-- This isn't one
of your pranks, is it?

21:37.235 --> 21:38.100
Uh-uh.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.300
Now, tell me the truth,

21:41.400 --> 21:42.400
are you cheating on my sister?

21:42.435 --> 21:43.100
No.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.200
You thinking about cheating on my sister?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.700
I'm sorry you guys can't go to the shower.

21:50.735 --> 21:51.900
Yeah, me too.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.200
If you see Ashley, tell her I said hello.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.900
I think I'll be seeing Ashley.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.000
But she's been seeing someone, you know.

21:58.035 --> 21:58.700
Still.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.300
I could love that girl.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.500
But don't tell her that,

22:03.535 --> 22:05.900
just-- Just tell her I said hello.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.100
I'll tell her.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.800
I love you.

22:11.835 --> 22:13.000
Oh, so we'll, uh, drop you off

22:13.035 --> 22:15.200
and then we'll pick you up
after the shower's over.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.300
And, uh, then I have a little gift for you.

22:18.335 --> 22:19.600
No, Ben.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.500
Ben, you are a gift.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.100
I can't believe how you've stayed
with me through this whole thing.

22:26.135 --> 22:27.300
You're so sweet.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.800
Uh, we'd better get going, Amy.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.900
Amy? Ben?

22:57.600 --> 22:58.600
Benjamin!

22:59.800 --> 23:01.100
Did you hear something?

23:02.100 --> 23:04.400
- No.
- What's with you two?

23:04.700 --> 23:06.600
I'm sorry, Mr. Boykewich.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.600
I'm just so happy today.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.200
Yeah, me too.

23:11.300 --> 23:15.700
Uh, I'm gonna go to the restroom downstairs.

23:19.900 --> 23:21.300
Oh. He's kicking.

23:21.900 --> 23:22.900
A lot.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
How much longer?

23:24.300 --> 23:26.200
- Three weeks.
- Can't wait.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.300
I can.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.500
Bye.

23:32.700 --> 23:35.000
You know, sexual activity can induce labor.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.300
So be careful. That's all I'm saying.

23:37.335 --> 23:38.500
She's got three weeks.

23:38.535 --> 23:40.400
That counts as sexual activity?

23:41.100 --> 23:42.600
Henry, you have a father, right?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.100
Discuss that stuff with him.

23:44.135 --> 23:46.300
Oh, I don't think he knows
anything about this stuff.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.900
What, you think a stork dropped you off?

24:03.900 --> 24:05.100
I got the ice!

24:07.400 --> 24:09.100
Your manager let me use
the machine by the pool.

24:09.135 --> 24:10.500
He's so nice.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.600
And so are your neighbors,
the Ortiz family.

24:12.635 --> 24:14.300
Mrs. Ortiz said she's gonna drop by

24:14.335 --> 24:17.400
and bring a little something,
some homemade salsa.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.600
She makes her own salsa
and she makes her own chips.

24:19.635 --> 24:20.900
I had to invite her.

24:21.100 --> 24:23.000
- You have to hide.
- Where?

24:23.035 --> 24:25.500
there. Just stay there, and
lock the door when I get out.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.000
I'll be right there, Grace!

24:31.000 --> 24:32.400
- Oh.
- Yeah.

24:32.900 --> 24:33.600
Oh.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.900
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:35.935 --> 24:37.800
- Are you...?
- Max.

24:37.835 --> 24:39.000
You must be Grace.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.200
I am so happy you finally called her.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.500
Yeah, I am too.

24:43.535 --> 24:44.900
Or you were about to be.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.600
Did I just hear someone at the door?

24:48.635 --> 24:49.500
Do you want me to get it?

24:49.535 --> 24:51.700
Yeah, if you don't mind.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.100
I think maybe I should get dressed.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.200
Well, it was so nice to finally meet you.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.900
He is cute.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.200
No, no, no, no, no. Don't leave.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.800
This shower will be over in a half-hour.

25:04.835 --> 25:07.100
I have to or Ruben's gonna get suspicious.

25:07.135 --> 25:08.300
Said I was going to the car wash.

25:08.335 --> 25:11.000
No, please, don't leave.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.500
Are you the slut that
had oral sex with Jack

25:17.535 --> 25:19.000
and broke him up with his girlfriend?

25:19.300 --> 25:20.700
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

25:20.735 --> 25:24.300
Um, this is the slut's condo,
but I'just answering the door.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
But she's not really a slut.

25:25.635 --> 25:27.100
She just has that reputation.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.600
Adrian's really such a nice girl.

25:28.635 --> 25:29.600
You're gonna love her.

25:30.600 --> 25:34.100
Adrian, Shawna's here.
Jack's new girlfriend.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.100
Oh, excuse me one second.

25:41.135 --> 25:43.400
So you must be the girlfriend.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.200
- The ex-girlfriend.
- Yeah.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.200
Hi, Alice! Come on in.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.100
Meet Shawna, Jack's new girlfriend.

25:53.500 --> 25:56.000
Another one? Is everyone
here one of Jack's girlfriends?

25:56.500 --> 25:57.900
Hi. Alice.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.400
Hi, Alice. Shawna.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.500
I don't think Jack's ever mentioned you.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.000
He's never mentioned you either.

26:03.035 --> 26:06.400
But Jack, like me, uses
discretion in his relationships.

26:06.435 --> 26:09.300
We don't broadcast our
every move over the Internet.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.500
You don't have to.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.300
I know when a man is cheating on me,

26:12.335 --> 26:14.000
and I know who he's cheating with.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.900
And it's not you.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.200
Would either of you two like some quiche?

26:19.235 --> 26:21.300
Quiche? There's quiche?

26:21.335 --> 26:22.600
Yeah, hi, come on in.

26:22.635 --> 26:24.600
If we had gotten our invitation in advance,

26:24.635 --> 26:27.200
we would have volunteered
to make full-size quiches.

26:27.235 --> 26:29.200
??The little ones are finger food.

26:30.300 --> 26:34.000
Uh, you two already know Alice.
But this is Shawna, Jack's girlfriend.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.200
Come in, come in, sit down,
make yourselves at home.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.900
- I'll take that for you.
- Oh, thank you.

26:45.300 --> 26:46.400
Adrian!

26:49.800 --> 26:51.200
Hi. I'm Grace Bowman.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.900
Oh, the Christian girl.

26:52.935 --> 26:53.800
Hi.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.900
Where's Adrian? I wanna meet Adrian.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.500
And Amy. And Ben. And Ricky.
Are the guys coming?

27:00.535 --> 27:02.000
No, it's just us girls.

27:02.035 --> 27:02.700
Oh.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.800
I'm sorry, and you are?

27:03.835 --> 27:06.200
Oh, yeah, right. I forgot.

27:06.235 --> 27:07.700
I'm Marc's wife, Virginia.

27:07.735 --> 27:08.900
Marc's wife?

27:08.935 --> 27:11.500
- Marc Molina.
- Mr. Molina's wife?

27:11.535 --> 27:12.400
Yeah.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.100
What do you have to eat?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.000
Oh, come in, sit down.

27:17.035 --> 27:18.600
- I'll get you a little bit of everything.
- Okay.

27:18.635 --> 27:20.800
I didn't know Mr. Molina was expecting.

27:21.500 --> 27:25.000
???

27:25.035 --> 27:27.400
????

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
That's my mother.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.800
She had a little accident in the parking lot.

27:31.835 --> 27:34.000
Thank heavens she dropped me off in front.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.000
And you shouldn't know
that Mr. Molina's expecting,

27:37.035 --> 27:41.300
because counselors should not discuss
personal business with students.

27:41.335 --> 27:44.500
And students shouldn't invite
counselors' wives to baby showers.

27:44.535 --> 27:46.200
Oh, that was probably Adrian.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.000
No, someone named Joe.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.400
Oh. Joe.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.800
Well, I'm so happy you came. Come in.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.500
I want to hit that lady.

27:57.535 --> 28:00.500
It's okay, Tammy. It was
upsetting, but it's just a car.

28:00.535 --> 28:02.000
Thankfully, no one got hurt.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.100
I can't believe she did that.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.900
You know, maybe Adrian knows who it is.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.200
We should get her license number.

28:07.235 --> 28:08.900
No, I think we better leave well enough alone.

28:08.935 --> 28:10.900
She looked nuts.
I don't like to criticize,

28:10.935 --> 28:12.300
but something was wrong with that woman.

28:12.335 --> 28:13.600
I don't want her to know who I am.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.500
- Are you okay?
- No.

28:16.535 --> 28:19.700
I told her I didn't want
to come to this shower.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.800
Yeah. Me neither.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.700
I have a really bad feeling about this.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
What up, G?

29:16.735 --> 29:17.600
Please.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.900
Didn't I tell you I'm
not a drop-in kind of guy?

29:20.100 --> 29:21.600
I don't know what type of meeting this is,

29:21.635 --> 29:23.100
but I'm gonna go wait in the truck.

29:23.135 --> 29:24.200
What are you talking about?

29:24.235 --> 29:25.000
Goodbye.

29:25.700 --> 29:26.600
What's in the pillowcase?

29:26.635 --> 29:27.500
Nothing.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.500
Come on. What's in there?

29:28.535 --> 29:29.300
What do you want?

29:29.335 --> 29:31.100
- I wanna know what's in there.
- I don't.

29:31.135 --> 29:33.300
It's none of your business.
It's my house. It's my room.

29:33.335 --> 29:35.200
- It's my pillowcase.
- Goodbye.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.400
Hey, if you tell anyone...

29:46.435 --> 29:48.500
- I won't. I--
- I will.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.900
I'm practicing diapering.
I've done it before,

29:50.935 --> 29:52.700
but it's been a while
since there was a baby here.

29:52.735 --> 29:55.200
I've never done it.
Let me try it. Here.

29:55.235 --> 29:57.100
You open the gift. Duncan, you time me.

29:57.700 --> 29:58.500
Okay.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.800
Am I in a basement with
two guys playing with dolls?

30:06.100 --> 30:07.900
Get this over there. Ah!

30:08.500 --> 30:09.400
Shoot.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.500
Hello, little mama.
Is the party for you?

30:21.535 --> 30:23.300
Yeah, I'm Amy. You have to help me.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.600
I think the baby is coming.

30:24.635 --> 30:26.000
Can you get my mom, please?

30:26.800 --> 30:27.700
Hurry.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.800
Hola, Mrs. Ortiz.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Everyone, this is Mrs. Ortiz.

30:55.035 --> 30:56.900
Is there a Mrs. Amy's mother?

30:56.935 --> 30:57.800
That's me.

30:57.835 --> 31:00.000
Everything's fine. You come with me.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.900
I have a surprise.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.500
Everyone, the surprise is
homemade chips and salsa.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.400
Doesn't that sound like fun?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Adrian!

31:22.000 --> 31:23.900
Amy, are you okay?

31:26.400 --> 31:27.800
I think this is it, Mom.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.300
I'm having the baby.

31:30.335 --> 31:32.700
Oh, I don't know, Amy.
You still got a few weeks left.

31:32.735 --> 31:35.100
And there's a lot of false
labor pains towards the end.

31:35.135 --> 31:37.300
Well, false or not, now
we have an excuse to leave.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.400
Mom, are you gonna take me to the hospital?

31:41.435 --> 31:43.700
Ashley, call your father.
Have him meet us there.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.800
Come on. Come on.

31:52.300 --> 31:53.800
- Did you tell her?
- I didn't get a chance.

31:53.835 --> 31:54.700
I think Amy's in labor.

31:54.735 --> 31:56.100
Just meet us at the hospital.

31:56.135 --> 31:58.400
Are you sure? I'm
paying these guys by the hour.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.700
- Dad.
- No kidding?

31:59.735 --> 32:00.800
You're on the way to the hospital?

32:00.835 --> 32:01.600
Yeah.

32:02.700 --> 32:04.300
????

32:16.700 --> 32:19.600
Okay, I'm gonna go in the next room,

32:20.200 --> 32:22.000
and I'm gonna turn the music on,

32:22.400 --> 32:24.700
and then you'll dance your way in,

32:24.735 --> 32:27.100
and I'll tell them that you're
the stripper for the party.

32:27.200 --> 32:31.500
Okay, one, I don't think they
have strippers at baby showers,

32:31.535 --> 32:33.900
and two, I'm not that good of a dancer,

32:33.935 --> 32:36.600
and three, I want your friends to like me.

32:36.635 --> 32:39.200
Walk around with your shirt
off and they'll like you.

32:54.800 --> 32:55.600
Adrian!

33:08.200 --> 33:09.500
What is going on?

33:09.535 --> 33:12.400
I was having a baby shower for Amy, but--

33:12.900 --> 33:13.800
Where is everyone?

33:13.835 --> 33:15.200
Well, I hope it was worth it.

33:15.235 --> 33:18.300
I hope one afternoon was
worth eight weeks of boot camp,

33:18.335 --> 33:19.700
getting up at 4 a.m.,

33:19.735 --> 33:21.900
running till you vomit,
and shaving your head.

33:21.935 --> 33:22.900
It was.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.600
I think I'm in love,
to tell you the truth.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.400
- In love?
- Yeah, Adrian.

33:29.435 --> 33:30.700
I'm falling in love with you.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.900
And I want him to know that.

33:33.100 --> 33:33.900
Really?

33:34.300 --> 33:37.100
I'm not comfortable with him knowing that.

33:37.135 --> 33:39.500
Why do you keep complicating my life?

33:40.100 --> 33:41.800
I don't know. I don't mean to.

33:41.835 --> 33:43.900
Yeah, you do. I think you do.

33:43.935 --> 33:46.000
I don't hear you saying
you're falling in love with him.

33:46.800 --> 33:49.000
Did you ever think I was
looking after your best interest

33:49.035 --> 33:51.100
when I discouraged you from
going out with Adrian?

33:51.200 --> 33:52.400
What do you mean by that?

33:52.435 --> 33:54.400
It means you've got
a lot of growing up to do.

33:54.435 --> 33:55.800
You're not ready to fall in love.

33:55.835 --> 33:57.500
You don't really know what love is.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.600
Could that be because my daddy
wasn't around when I was growing up?

34:02.200 --> 34:04.900
Or could that be because you
don't know what love really is?

34:06.000 --> 34:09.300
Tell him, or better yet, tell your wife.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.400
He's been seeing my mom.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.400
All those out-of-town seminars,

34:15.500 --> 34:16.500
those are a lie.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.300
You can thank me later for
getting you out of boot camp.

34:19.335 --> 34:21.100
You know, they take girls too.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.300
I really didn't wanna know.

34:31.900 --> 34:34.800
And did you wanna tell me
you love me too, before I go?

34:39.100 --> 34:40.000
I didn't think so.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.699
You know, I think if I had
tried a couple more times,

34:52.300 --> 34:53.400
I could've beat him.

34:54.699 --> 34:57.200
I don't-- I don't get the time-trial aspect.

34:57.235 --> 34:59.900
I don't know why you have to
hurry up and put the diaper on.

34:59.935 --> 35:02.400
I think the thing is cleanliness,

35:02.500 --> 35:04.700
comfort and safety.

35:05.200 --> 35:08.800
I mean, not that I wanna be
talking about this kind of stuff

35:08.835 --> 35:11.400
while I'm eating or before I'm 30.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.400
So you think I'm cheating on you?

35:30.100 --> 35:31.100
Yeah.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.200
With Grace.

35:33.700 --> 35:35.300
We kissed. That's it.

35:35.335 --> 35:37.500
You see, I went over there to
help out with the baby shower.

35:37.535 --> 35:40.700
She wanted me to bring over one of
those helium tanks to blow up balloons.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.800
I didn't see any balloons.

35:42.835 --> 35:45.500
We were outside and we
weren't paying attention.

35:45.535 --> 35:46.700
They kind of floated away.

35:46.735 --> 35:48.500
But there were balloons.
I'm not lying about that.

35:48.535 --> 35:50.100
What are you lying about?

35:50.135 --> 35:51.100
Nothing, really.

35:51.135 --> 35:53.900
I like you and I like being with you.

35:54.200 --> 35:57.500
I just-- I don't really get the feeling
you wanna be with me for a lifetime.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.900
I thought I did.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.500
- And then?
- I met your friends.

36:01.535 --> 36:02.600
What's wrong with my friends?

36:02.635 --> 36:03.900
They're all...

36:03.935 --> 36:07.500
teenagers, and I'm not a teenager,

36:07.535 --> 36:11.200
and you should be able to be a teenager,

36:11.235 --> 36:13.200
and I don't wanna take that from you,

36:13.600 --> 36:16.000
and I don't wanna be a teenager again myself.

36:16.035 --> 36:17.700
- Really?
- Really.

36:17.735 --> 36:21.800
I like being 20 and I'm about to be 21.

36:21.835 --> 36:23.800
And if there's five years
difference between us,

36:23.835 --> 36:26.400
I could actually get arrested
for sleeping with you.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.400
Yeah, but I wanted to sleep with you, so...

36:30.300 --> 36:32.900
You said "wanted." Past tense.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.200
Did I?

36:35.900 --> 36:36.600
You did.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.400
This where you tell me we can be friends?

36:38.435 --> 36:40.600
Because I don't get that.

36:40.900 --> 36:41.700
Okay.

36:41.735 --> 36:44.200
Then I will just be Duncan's sister,

36:44.235 --> 36:47.600
and you can still be Duncan's mentor.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.600
Please. Because he really likes you.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.700
And so do I.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.200
I really like you too, Shawna.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So I guess I'll, uh...

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
I'll see you around?

37:05.200 --> 37:06.400
- Okay.
- All right.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.500
All right, I'll see you next Monday?

37:15.535 --> 37:16.600
- Okay.
- All right.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.100
Oh, my big sister's growing up.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.600
Seriously, you did a great job.

37:32.635 --> 37:34.900
It's hard to be a hostess
at someone else's house.

37:34.935 --> 37:35.800
It wasn't too bad, was it?

37:35.835 --> 37:36.400
No.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.200
I can always say the first
time I threw a baby shower,

37:38.235 --> 37:39.300
the baby came the same day.

37:39.335 --> 37:40.500
Exactly.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.600
- How did it go?
- It was nice.

37:43.635 --> 37:46.800
Tammy called me and she said it was terrible.

37:46.835 --> 37:48.500
Oh, it was a lovely shower.

37:48.535 --> 37:49.400
And Tom, guess what?

37:49.435 --> 37:51.700
Amy's on her way to the
hospital to have the baby.

37:51.735 --> 37:53.100
Ouch.

37:54.100 --> 37:57.500
I mean, oh, the miracle of life.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.400
Hey, Mom, um,

38:01.000 --> 38:02.900
there's something I wanted to tell you.

38:03.300 --> 38:04.600
You sound serious.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.300
I hope this isn't about
those birth control pills.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Oh, I hope they get a room ready soon.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.500
It's okay.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.900
Why don't you and Ashley go take a walk?

38:22.300 --> 38:23.600
Oh, I don't-- I don't know, Mom.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.700
I think I'd rather wait for the
pain medication and then take a walk.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.900
Well, Amy, after you take the pain medication,

38:28.935 --> 38:30.500
you won't be able to walk.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.800
Oh. Yeah. I forgot.

38:33.835 --> 38:37.400
Good thing we scheduled that marathon
birthing seminar for next weekend.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.400
Good plan.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.200
Ashley, can you...?

38:44.900 --> 38:45.700
Thanks.

38:51.900 --> 38:52.900
Are you okay?

38:54.500 --> 38:55.200
No.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.700
What if that big baby can't get
through that little girl of ours?

39:05.200 --> 39:06.400
She'll be okay.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.100
The doctor said she'll be okay.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.600
How does the doctor know she'll be okay?

39:11.200 --> 39:12.600
Because she's a doctor.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.200
I can't believe that Amy's having a baby.

39:18.300 --> 39:19.900
I still don't want to believe it.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.500
Yeah, me neither. But it's true.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.800
What are you and Ashley not telling me?

39:27.835 --> 39:29.800
Some other time. This isn't the right time.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.300
I wanna know.

39:31.700 --> 39:32.800
You'll just get upset.

39:32.835 --> 39:34.700
My 15-year-old daughter is having a baby,

39:34.735 --> 39:36.100
and I'm not that upset.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.400
I think I'm doing okay, don't you?

39:38.800 --> 39:41.500
Yeah, you are doing okay.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.000
You're a strong woman, Anne.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.500
A lot stronger than I ever realized.

39:46.700 --> 39:47.500
Thank you.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.100
Ashley's moving in with me.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.200
Are you scared?

39:55.400 --> 39:56.300
Yeah.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.100
But I can't wait.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.300
I can't wait to see him.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.200
Yeah, me too.

40:04.700 --> 40:07.200
You're gonna help me with him,
aren't you, Ashley?

40:07.900 --> 40:08.900
Of course I am.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.200
You're not just moving in with Dad

40:11.235 --> 40:13.200
so I can have your room for a nursery?

40:13.900 --> 40:15.700
You're gonna use my room as a nursery?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.200
I'm kidding.

40:20.300 --> 40:21.700
Lot of changes this year.

40:22.300 --> 40:23.000
Yeah.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.700
Ashley, ??nt you to be in the
room with me when he comes.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.900
Um, Amy,

40:32.100 --> 40:34.200
there are things you can't really un-see.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.100
You're kidding again, right?

40:37.900 --> 40:39.000
Right.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.900
I don't mind staying with you

40:40.935 --> 40:43.300
as long as I don't have to see anything.

40:43.700 --> 40:44.900
I feel the same way.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.600
Hi, Amy.

40:58.600 --> 40:59.800
We were waiting for you.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.300
Thank you.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.700
You can't be in the room.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.200
I will be wherever you want me to be.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.800
Did you call Ricky?

41:15.400 --> 41:18.100
No, uh, someone will probably call him.

41:18.135 --> 41:20.900
Adrian's probably already called him. Or Grace.

41:20.935 --> 41:22.100
Shouldn't you call him?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.100
Let's try to do the right thing,

41:25.200 --> 41:27.700
you and me, for the baby.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.200
Hi, Ricky. It's me, Amy.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.600
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm at the hospital.

41:40.635 --> 41:42.100
I didn't know if someone had called you.

41:42.135 --> 41:44.600
No. Why are you at the hospital?
Is everything okay?

41:44.800 --> 41:45.900
Everything's fine.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.100
The baby's coming.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.200
- Oh, my God. Now?
- Yeah.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.600
I thought maybe you'd wanna be here.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.300
You did?

41:56.400 --> 41:58.800
I mean, I didn't know if you
wanted me to be there or not.

41:58.835 --> 42:00.200
We never really talked about it.

42:00.235 --> 42:02.900
Well, I think you should be here.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.800
He's your son.
