[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

37:29.915 --> 37:31.781
-OKAY IF I INTERRUPT?
-YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.483
-OF COURSE.
-SO EVERYBODY'S FLOWN IN?

37:33.485 --> 37:35.251
I'VE GOT
ALL THE BEAUTIES IN HERE.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.120
Dr. Amos:
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.789
I JUST WANTED
TO GO OVER WHAT WE FOUND.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.759
SO, WE DID WHAT'S CALLED
A VENTRICULOGRAM

37:42.761 --> 37:43.993
WHERE WE PUT
A WHOLE BUNCH OF CONTRAST

37:43.995 --> 37:46.262
AND LOOK
AT HIS HEART FUNCTION.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.599
THIS WHOLE WALL IS NOT WORKING,
AND THIS ONE'S NOT WORKING.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.634
IT'S CALLED
A STRESS-INDUCED HEART FAILURE,

37:51.636 --> 37:55.038
WHERE A MAJOR, STRESSFUL EVENT
OR MORE STRESS THAN USUAL

37:55.040 --> 37:57.006
CAN CAUSE HEART FAILURE.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.513
AND THE WAY WE GET TROPONIN
IN THE BLOOD IS

38:03.515 --> 38:06.516
THE CELLS DIE AND RELEASE
THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BLOOD.

38:06.518 --> 38:11.621
SO, A LITTLE HEART ATTACK
WOULD BE A TROPONIN OF 0.5 OR 1.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.324
HIS WAS 80.

38:14.326 --> 38:17.827
YEAH, A BIG,
BIG BUMP IN TROPONIN.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.229
SO, YOU HAD
A LOT OF HEART DAMAGE.

38:19.231 --> 38:21.030
IT COULD HAVE KILLED YOU.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.399
YOU HAD THE WIDOW-MAKER.

38:23.401 --> 38:25.935
-YOU THINK SO?
-MM-HMM.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.837
WITH A TROPONIN OF 80 --
-THAT CAN'T -- WELL --

38:27.839 --> 38:29.639
IT WAS
A HIT TO THE HEART.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.175
THIS WAS A BIG ONE.
THIS COULD HAVE KILLED YOU.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.611
YOU'RE LUCKY.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.649
HE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF CLOT-BUSTERS CALLED LYTICS

38:39.651 --> 38:41.151
WHEN HE WAS
IN DUTCH HARBOR.

38:41.153 --> 38:44.020
LUCKILY,
THOSE CLOT-BUSTERS WORKED

38:44.022 --> 38:46.856
AND OPENED THAT VESSEL,
SO THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.292
THE NATURAL PROGRESSION
OF HEART FAILURE IS

38:49.294 --> 38:50.860
IT GETS WORSE
OVER THE TIME.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.696
AND 50% OF PEOPLE CAN BE DEAD
AT FIVE YEARS

38:53.698 --> 38:55.298
IF YOU DO NOTHING.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.067
SO WHATEVER DAMAGE
ISN'T GONNA REGENERATE?

38:58.069 --> 38:59.702
NO, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
GONNA NEED A CARDIOLOGIST

38:59.704 --> 39:02.038

-[BLEEP]

39:02.040 --> 39:04.073

TO PREVENT ANOTHER ONE,

39:04.075 --> 39:05.775
'CAUSE A SECOND HIT,
OBVIOUSLY,

39:05.777 --> 39:07.443
THEN YOU GET WORSE
AND WORSE HEART FAILURE

39:07.445 --> 39:09.479
GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND.
-WHAT THE --

39:09.481 --> 39:11.181
WHY THE HELL
AM I GETTING HEART ATTACKS?

39:11.183 --> 39:13.383
WELL, SMOKING,
WHICH YOU DO,

39:13.385 --> 39:15.552
SO WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT,
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

39:15.554 --> 39:19.889
AND I DON'T LOSE MY JOB.
NOBODY CAN TAKE MY SPOT, RIGHT?

39:19.891 --> 39:21.991
I CAN GO FISHING.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.561
WELL, LIFESTYLE CHANGES

39:24.563 --> 39:26.963
DEFINITELY MAKE A DIFFERENCE,
YOU KNOW?

39:26.965 --> 39:28.665
IT'S YOUR BIGGEST
RISK FACTOR.

39:34.372 --> 39:38.174
WELL, YOU HAD ME FEELING GOOD
FOR A MINUTE THERE.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.276
IF YOU DO THE THINGS
WE RECOMMEND,

39:40.278 --> 39:41.811
YOU WILL HAVE
A NORMAL LIFE SPAN.

39:41.813 --> 39:45.548
IF NOT,
IT WILL NOT BE PRETTY.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.586
SO, 72 HOURS FROM NOW IS
WHEN I'D LET YOU GO.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.421
WE'RE JUST WATCHING,
MAKING SURE,

39:51.423 --> 39:52.589
AND THAT WAY
WE CAN JUMP ON YOU

39:52.591 --> 39:55.558

IF YOUR HEART STOPS.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.994
-IT COULD STILL STOP?
-WELL, YEAH,

39:57.996 --> 40:01.564
'CAUSE IT'S IRRITATED
FROM THAT HEART ATTACK.

IT'S OUT OF HOSPITAL ARREST.

TO GET UP TO THE LINE

AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE DID.

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:49.177
THERE'S A LOT OF RESENTMENT
ON WHO I AM,

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:52.880
BEING A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN
AND A DAD IN ZACK'S MIND.

IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
WHAT HE RESENTS IN ME,

01:00:56.219 --> 01:01:00.021
I'M WORKING ON TURNING HIM
INTO THE SAME GUY.

MAYBE ZACK THINKS THAT BY HIM
TAKING OVER THE CAPTAIN'S CHAIR,

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.593
HE'S GONNA END UP LIKE ME.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.895

LIKE THE OUTCOME OF ME.

A SUPER TOUGH DAY.

TO TAKE THE WHOLE THING.

THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY OF ZACK
FOLLOWING IN MY FOOTSTEPS,

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:34.389
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK ZACK
WHICH WAY HE'S GONNA WALK.

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:41.329
HE'S EITHER GONNA WALK UP
THE STAIRS OR WALK OFF THE BOAT.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:44.232
