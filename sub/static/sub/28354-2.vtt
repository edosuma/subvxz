WEBVTT

00:03.143 --> 00:05.349
All my life, I've been a people person.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.804
I get along with everybody.

00:09.953 --> 00:11.870
Get off me, man! Get off me!

00:12.410 --> 00:13.799
Kitchen's our side of the prison.

00:13.803 --> 00:16.202
- You don't belong here, boy.
- I ain't never been a boy, man.

00:16.215 --> 00:18.745
I was born with a grown-man
dick, you understand?

00:18.755 --> 00:21.158
Looked like a baby arm holding an apple.

00:23.955 --> 00:25.754
Leave him alone!

00:26.526 --> 00:29.216
I suggest you step off
before you get dealt with.

00:29.241 --> 00:31.154
Come on, Billy. He don't
belong on our side.

00:31.179 --> 00:32.209
Tray's good.

00:32.234 --> 00:34.503
He's the one I told you made
those "Poppin' Off Tarts."

00:34.528 --> 00:35.542
For your birthday?

00:35.567 --> 00:37.339
Yeah, the ones with the sprinkles.

00:37.364 --> 00:39.788
Aw, hell, man. Those
were the shit. My bad.

00:39.813 --> 00:41.773
Whatever, man. You
tried to kill me, man.

00:41.774 --> 00:43.621
We're good. For now.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.113
B, good looking.

00:50.114 --> 00:51.513
They gonna put me on the set, man.

00:51.514 --> 00:54.113
- Somebody gotta hold me down.
- Nah, Tray.

00:54.114 --> 00:57.583
That ain't you. I got a better idea.

00:57.584 --> 00:58.665
Come on.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.029
Yo, Cookie.

01:03.594 --> 01:06.463
This here's the dishwasher
I told you about... Tray.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.293
I thought he could help you out.

01:08.808 --> 01:10.133
Nah, I don't need no help.

01:10.134 --> 01:11.533
Wait a minute, Cookie.

01:11.534 --> 01:14.035
Before you say no, why don't
you give me your leftover

01:14.060 --> 01:17.661
- ingredients and watch the magic.
- Okay.

01:24.093 --> 01:27.583
Okay, all I need is the salt from this.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.684
Put some SPAM in here.
Who doesn't love SPAM?

01:31.819 --> 01:34.823
Once I separate the spoiled
part of this potato salad,

01:34.824 --> 01:36.823
the paprika is all I need.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.224
My version of hot wings.

01:39.234 --> 01:40.506
I call them "Ghetto Burners"

01:40.531 --> 01:42.812
'cause they're made with the
pepper spray from the guards.

01:45.974 --> 01:47.077
Good, huh?

01:47.102 --> 01:50.212
I just got an erection for
the first time in years.

01:50.982 --> 01:52.304
How did you figure this out?

01:52.314 --> 01:55.306
Just like how the slaves took
parts of the hogs and bitter roots

01:55.491 --> 01:57.043
and they invented soul food.

01:57.265 --> 01:59.404
I just did what I could
do with what I had.

01:59.429 --> 02:00.758
So, what do you think, Cookie?

02:00.783 --> 02:01.983
You gonna let me train under you?

02:01.984 --> 02:03.314
Otherwise, the Brotherhood...

02:03.633 --> 02:04.923
they're gonna cut me from hole to hole

02:04.924 --> 02:06.752
and have me looking like a black piñata.

02:06.777 --> 02:11.023
Billy, let the Brotherhood know
that Tray works with me.

02:11.188 --> 02:12.388
He's neutral.

02:12.413 --> 02:14.644
Thank you, Cookie. Thank you so much.

02:14.669 --> 02:17.338
And you can pay me back with
some of those special recipes.

02:17.363 --> 02:20.407
Like I said, I get along with everybody.

02:27.546 --> 02:30.278
Listen, nobody likes to remind you

02:30.303 --> 02:32.085
that you ain't shit more than me.

02:32.593 --> 02:35.662
In fact, you ain't shit.

02:36.084 --> 02:40.423
But look, gentlemen, you're not
supposed to be down on yourself.

02:41.489 --> 02:43.198
This is why I try to motivate you.

02:43.223 --> 02:45.956
Y-You think I don't understand
how hard it is to get back

02:45.981 --> 02:47.706
out there in the
workplace and start over?

02:48.046 --> 02:52.446
- I do, because I've done it.
- Mullins, the struggle is real.

02:52.774 --> 02:55.231
I don't care how many
résumé classes you give us.

02:55.256 --> 02:56.621
Or interview classes.

02:56.646 --> 02:57.977
Or "redding" classes.

02:58.002 --> 03:00.534
- Reading class.
- Reading classes, Big Country.

03:00.773 --> 03:03.103
Look, if you live here, you work.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.113
That's the agreement that you
all signed up when you got here,

03:06.114 --> 03:08.198
so if you don't want to
work, live somewhere else.

03:08.466 --> 03:10.397
You're not hearing me, Mullins.

03:10.634 --> 03:12.173
I'm not saying I don't want to work.

03:12.198 --> 03:14.727
I'm just saying maybe I'd be
better off doing it for myself.

03:14.752 --> 03:17.891
As what, a Biz Markie impersonator?

03:17.916 --> 03:19.246
Come on, man, as a chef.

03:19.271 --> 03:20.965
Everybody here know what I'm good at.

03:21.272 --> 03:24.302
I been cooking for y'all ever
since I've been here, okay?

03:24.327 --> 03:25.615
I just want to create someplace

03:25.640 --> 03:27.556
where people be happy with my food,

03:27.581 --> 03:28.980
with something that I made.

03:29.341 --> 03:31.027
But you wouldn't know about that,

03:31.052 --> 03:32.775
'cause you don't know
about dreams, Mullins.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.171
I wouldn't know about dreams?

03:34.196 --> 03:36.309
You guys... see, y'all
think that this halfway house

03:36.334 --> 03:37.934
is the end for me, but it's not.

03:37.959 --> 03:39.089
It's only the beginning.

03:39.258 --> 03:41.037
Don't tell me 'bout some dreams.

03:41.062 --> 03:43.729
Matter of fact, here.
Y'all fill out these forms.

03:43.754 --> 03:48.223
I need y'all to go out and
get five job inquiries on there

03:48.224 --> 03:50.480
a day, with real names and real places,

03:50.505 --> 03:52.871
- 'cause I'm gonna check them.
- Uh, well, I'm gonna need a new one.

03:52.895 --> 03:54.877
I filled this out with
names of Wu-Tang Clan.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.431
Are you serious, Big Country?

03:56.764 --> 03:58.494
You misspelled "RZA"?

03:59.286 --> 04:00.502
It's three letters.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.300
- Thank you.
- There you go.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.279
Mom finally lets you walk us to
school, and we're gonna be late.

04:05.304 --> 04:08.674
Yeah, I just need one more signature
to get Mullins off my back.

04:09.584 --> 04:11.843
Wait, so you're not really
interested in any of these jobs?

04:11.844 --> 04:14.338
Well, that's the problem,
Amira. They're just jobs.

04:14.363 --> 04:16.512
I want to focus my energy
on something bigger,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.853
like opening my own restaurant!

04:19.853 --> 04:24.323
You know, 90% of the restaurants
go under in the first year.

04:24.324 --> 04:25.652
There, see, there you go.

04:25.677 --> 04:27.800
Why you gotta do the whole
Darth Vader thing with me?

04:27.825 --> 04:28.919
You know what I mean?

04:28.944 --> 04:32.249
I knew a dude on death row that was
more positive than you, Shahzad.

04:32.274 --> 04:33.492
Didn't you ever have stuff in life

04:33.516 --> 04:34.975
that you wanted to do one day?

04:35.134 --> 04:37.334
It was getting a
perfect-attendance award,

04:37.344 --> 04:39.204
but you're ruining that
by making us late now.

04:39.214 --> 04:43.213
Mnh-mnh! 'Cause we
here! Look! Relax, okay?

04:43.214 --> 04:44.952
I'll see you guys later. I love you.

04:46.618 --> 04:47.688
Come on.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.753
Y'all too cool to say "I
love you" to your father?

04:50.154 --> 04:52.023
We haven't known you that long.

04:53.354 --> 04:56.954
You guys have a good
time, okay? See you later.

05:01.691 --> 05:03.057
One more signature.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.563
You're an ex-felon?

05:05.564 --> 05:07.286
Yep, not Rothman material.

05:07.311 --> 05:08.973
I just need you to
sign this sheet right...

05:08.974 --> 05:14.513
Actually, we are part of a community
re-entry employment program.

05:14.514 --> 05:18.507
Uh, we receive incentives for
offering entry-level positions

05:18.532 --> 05:22.286
and training, so if you could
just fill out this application...

05:22.784 --> 05:24.053
Entry-level?

05:24.054 --> 05:25.724
You know, uh, janitorial,

05:25.749 --> 05:27.431
groundskeeping, that kind of thing.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.424
Let me just level up with you, man.

05:30.449 --> 05:32.179
I wanna be a chef.

05:32.204 --> 05:35.077
You know, so if you just do
me a solid, sign this sheet,

05:35.102 --> 05:36.909
you know, just to say I tried.

05:37.204 --> 05:40.333
Okay, well, let me come
clean with you, as well.

05:40.334 --> 05:44.543
We're a bit behind in our
quota for the re-entry program

05:44.544 --> 05:48.897
to qualify for the incentives,
so if you could do me a solid

05:48.922 --> 05:51.213
and just fill out the application...

05:51.214 --> 05:54.953
just so we both can say that we tried?

05:54.954 --> 05:56.214
Same time?

05:56.601 --> 05:57.730
Same time.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:08.234 --> 06:11.963
Okay, so, what's the difference
between a secant and a chord?

06:11.964 --> 06:14.973
- Girl, I don't know!
- Don't worry. It's easy.

06:14.974 --> 06:18.219
Okay, so a chord terminates on
the circumference of a circle,

06:18.244 --> 06:21.313
- and a secant...
- Oh, goes on indefinitely!

06:21.314 --> 06:24.713
- There you go, Sheila, hey!
- Hey!

06:24.714 --> 06:27.183
Ooh, turn it up. That's my part.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.833
♪ Aye, I need to fill up the tank ♪

06:28.858 --> 06:30.187
♪ No, I need to fill up the safe ♪

06:30.188 --> 06:31.987
♪ I need to let all these hoes know ♪

06:31.988 --> 06:33.857
♪ That none of they niggas is safe ♪

06:33.858 --> 06:36.172
- Hey!
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:36.197 --> 06:38.164
Hey! We don't use that word.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.191
Dad, be cool.

06:40.216 --> 06:42.616
No, my house, my rules.

06:43.082 --> 06:44.741
I'll call you back, Sheila.

06:44.766 --> 06:47.606
- Thanks for ruining homework.
- Sorry.

06:48.060 --> 06:49.241
It's my job.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.350
See? I tried.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.105
Five signatures, still nothing.

06:54.130 --> 06:55.239
Nothing.

06:55.264 --> 06:56.878
The Rothman School called.

06:56.888 --> 06:59.217
You got a job working
in their cafeteria.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.387
Wait a minute.

07:01.026 --> 07:02.695
I got a job in the cafeteria?

07:03.558 --> 07:05.827
I'm a chef!

07:05.828 --> 07:07.058
No, I saw how much you're getting paid.

07:07.082 --> 07:08.720
Trust me. You're a cook.

07:08.745 --> 07:10.744
Yeah, you just watch.

07:16.308 --> 07:19.007
Yeah, this is what I call a drum solo.

07:19.908 --> 07:22.324
Hey, Sheila. You ready
for the geometry test?

07:22.349 --> 07:24.245
You know it, girl! Okay, bye, Mom.

07:24.270 --> 07:25.340
That's Sheila?

07:25.365 --> 07:27.820
You let a white girl use
the N-word around you?

07:27.845 --> 07:30.717
It was in a song. It
wasn't in a bad way.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.648
Any way is the bad way.

07:32.658 --> 07:34.633
White people buy more
hip-hop than us, okay?

07:34.658 --> 07:35.999
Every artist knows that.

07:36.024 --> 07:38.387
So they must be okay with
them saying the N-word, too.

07:38.388 --> 07:40.924
No, I'm not talking about
rappers being okay with it.

07:40.949 --> 07:41.988
You shouldn't be.

07:42.013 --> 07:44.727
Listen, I feel like our
generation is kind of

07:44.728 --> 07:46.067
taking the word back, you know?

07:46.092 --> 07:47.622
Defusing its negativity.

07:47.647 --> 07:49.273
Only black people can
take that word back,

07:49.297 --> 07:52.507
not little white girls named
Sheila who play field hockey.

07:53.033 --> 07:55.183
Lacrosse. Don't stereotype.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.377
Just like the only black girl in
class shouldn't be on C.P. time.

07:58.705 --> 08:00.863
- Bye!
- I'm not okay with that term either. Bye.

08:00.888 --> 08:02.633
- Bye, bye.
- Bye.

08:03.354 --> 08:04.483
Have a good day.

08:12.207 --> 08:13.482
- Hi.
- Oh.

08:13.507 --> 08:15.803
You're Sheila's mom,
right? Josh Birkeland.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.957
Sheila and my daughter,
Amira, they're friends.

08:17.982 --> 08:19.346
Oh, yeah, hi, hi.

08:19.371 --> 08:20.910
Yeah, Sheila talks
about Amira all the time.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.798
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, as well.

08:22.823 --> 08:25.998
This is gonna seem like it's
sort of out of nowhere, but, uh,

08:26.023 --> 08:27.907
something happened while
the girls were studying,

08:27.908 --> 08:29.578
and I thought you'd want to know, so...

08:29.603 --> 08:31.777
Uh-oh, if it's that Sheila's
dumb as a brick, don't worry.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.434
I already know. Thank God she's pretty.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.216
That wasn't it.

08:35.241 --> 08:38.840
Um, no, uh, Sheila used the N-word.

08:39.732 --> 08:40.787
Oh, no.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.748
They were singing along
to some hip-hop music,

08:42.773 --> 08:43.886
and I overheard her say it.

08:43.912 --> 08:45.181
- I was like...
- Oh.

08:45.206 --> 08:46.805
Oh, well, it was in the song.

08:46.830 --> 08:50.839
Yes. Yes, it was, but
it's still... the N-word.

08:50.951 --> 08:52.280
Did Amira say it?

08:52.305 --> 08:53.448
That doesn't matter.

08:53.473 --> 08:55.072
I'm... I'm just saying, you know,

08:55.538 --> 08:56.948
in situations like this,

08:56.973 --> 09:01.042
you have to admit, it's a little
bit... confusing, you know?

09:01.219 --> 09:03.434
Okay, you know what? Let me, uh,

09:03.459 --> 09:07.393
let me make things a little
less confusing for you, okay?

09:07.418 --> 09:09.947
Uh, I'm married to a black
woman with two black kids,

09:09.948 --> 09:12.373
and I'm not comfortable
with your white daughter

09:12.968 --> 09:15.943
- using the N-word around my black daughter.
- Oh.

09:15.968 --> 09:17.957
I'm not comfortable with Amira using it.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.688
There is too much history
behind what that word means.

09:20.698 --> 09:22.777
I-I, uh, I'll talk to Sheila.

09:23.193 --> 09:24.223
Thank you.

09:27.898 --> 09:29.473
We're Jewish, by the way.

09:37.301 --> 09:39.840
- Thank you.
- Yo, what up, Tray?

09:40.048 --> 09:42.517
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, young Jedi.

09:42.518 --> 09:43.747
Just serving lunch.

09:44.248 --> 09:46.742
Honestly, I thought I'd
be serving my dishes.

09:46.767 --> 09:47.805
Quinoa? What is that?

09:47.830 --> 09:49.329
That's Indian for "cream of wheat."

09:51.658 --> 09:53.717
Here. Try some of this.

09:53.975 --> 09:56.174
Wrap your mouth around
that. Tell me what you think.

09:56.780 --> 10:00.620
What is this? This is so good! Oh, yeah!

10:00.645 --> 10:02.867
That's my "C-Block Macaroni and Cheese"

10:02.868 --> 10:04.394
made with four different cheeses.

10:04.419 --> 10:06.937
You got Cheetos in there,
you got cheese puffs,

10:06.938 --> 10:08.673
Cheez Whiz, and most importantly,

10:08.698 --> 10:10.007
you got government cheese.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.408
- It is baked into that.
- Wow.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.753
Yeah, see that look right there?

10:14.778 --> 10:16.707
That's why your father
does what he does.

10:16.789 --> 10:18.789
'Cause I want to bring
people joy with my food.

10:18.814 --> 10:20.746
Do you think I can have
this for my lunch instead?

10:20.770 --> 10:22.029
If you think that was good,

10:22.054 --> 10:24.053
I'm-a lay some more treats on you.

10:24.463 --> 10:26.062
Travel with that, beloved.

10:26.087 --> 10:28.826
Does this have sugar in it?
That's against school policy.

10:28.898 --> 10:31.167
Guaranteed to make your foot go numb.

10:31.168 --> 10:33.367
You gonna be on insulin for life.

10:33.368 --> 10:35.767
I wish the other kids
could taste your cooking.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.459
I'm-a lay some more treats
on you later, so remember,

10:38.484 --> 10:39.975
tell a friend to tell a friend.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.399
- Gotcha.
- Okay.

10:41.424 --> 10:42.523
Hey, Shahzad.

10:43.764 --> 10:44.863
I love you.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.057
Oh, come on, man.

10:53.488 --> 10:55.489
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

10:55.514 --> 10:58.417
That's great, yes.

10:58.442 --> 11:00.081
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

11:00.628 --> 11:02.914
You would've been so
proud of me just now.

11:02.939 --> 11:04.104
Oh, yeah? What happened?

11:04.129 --> 11:09.037
Well, yesterday, I overheard
Sheila use the N-word.

11:09.038 --> 11:11.260
Sheila better not have
called my baby girl a nigger.

11:11.285 --> 11:14.299
No, no. They... they were
singing along to a hip-hop song.

11:14.324 --> 11:16.379
- Oh.
- I talked to Sheila's mom,

11:16.404 --> 11:17.863
and she agreed to talk to Sheila.

11:18.238 --> 11:19.638
Okay, great, thank you.

11:19.663 --> 11:21.380
- Good.
- Mwah.

11:21.754 --> 11:22.912
Yeah.

11:23.375 --> 11:25.998
So, when you talk to
Sheila or Sheila's mom,

11:26.023 --> 11:27.324
there's no need to bring it up.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.364
- I wasn't going to.
- I know.

11:30.389 --> 11:31.428
I just, uh,

11:32.728 --> 11:34.653
I think I already said
everything you would've wanted

11:34.677 --> 11:35.918
to say anyway, so...

11:35.943 --> 11:37.342
Got that.

11:37.367 --> 11:40.166
But why is it okay for you
to say something, but not me?

11:40.191 --> 11:44.260
I'm saying there's no... there's
no need for you to overreact.

11:44.285 --> 11:45.548
You talked to her mom because

11:45.573 --> 11:47.713
she said a word that was in a rap song.

11:47.738 --> 11:49.571
- That's overreacting.
- Really?

11:49.596 --> 11:51.120
Yeah, I don't know why
you're lecturing me.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.390
I'm not, it's just...
you know how you are

11:53.415 --> 11:55.645
about, you know, certain things.

11:58.273 --> 11:59.733
How am I?

11:59.958 --> 12:02.057
Certain things, they make you...

12:03.375 --> 12:04.565
go off.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.011
Oh, is that why you
talked to Sheila's mom?

12:06.035 --> 12:08.002
Because you thought I
would "go off" on her?

12:08.387 --> 12:10.073
Well, yeah, kind of, yes.

12:10.098 --> 12:12.505
First of all, I know
how to talk to people.

12:12.844 --> 12:15.483
Second, why are you all of a
sudden so concerned about me?

12:16.038 --> 12:18.907
Because you scare white
people when you get mad.

12:20.093 --> 12:21.147
Wow.

12:25.822 --> 12:27.246
I didn't mean it like that.

12:28.178 --> 12:30.117
- Shay.
- I don't want to scare you.

12:42.868 --> 12:46.892
Shay, I'm... I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.559
It should not have come out that way,

12:48.584 --> 12:50.053
but if I'm being honest,

12:50.078 --> 12:53.147
you have a history of
scaring white people.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.401
Why's she doing me like
this? I'm rich, bitch!

12:56.426 --> 12:57.825
Look at me. Look at this dress.

12:57.850 --> 13:00.119
This dress $700. You see these shoes?

13:00.144 --> 13:03.344
Don't tell me to be quiet,
okay? I got a library card.

13:03.369 --> 13:04.855
So do my man. As a matter of fact,

13:04.880 --> 13:07.793
we done donated a gag of money
to this little raggedy library.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.617
This is where I live, okay?!

13:09.642 --> 13:11.511
I've been living here
for quite some time!

13:11.536 --> 13:13.700
Josh, tell him. This is my property,

13:13.725 --> 13:16.160
that we live here as husband and wife!

13:16.185 --> 13:17.544
Tell him!

13:18.620 --> 13:22.254
Wha... What? Those
were actual incidents.

13:22.288 --> 13:23.985
Usually when you ask me for evidence

13:24.010 --> 13:26.083
to back up my arguments, I can't.

13:26.108 --> 13:28.814
So you think all of those
things happened for no reason?

13:29.448 --> 13:30.703
May I see your ID?

13:30.728 --> 13:32.322
Sure, but why'd you ask for my ID?

13:32.347 --> 13:34.667
You didn't ask for that young
lady's ID that was just here.

13:34.718 --> 13:37.617
- I was just doing my job, ma'am.
- But do you know her?

13:43.258 --> 13:45.437
Ladies, could you please keep it down?

13:45.462 --> 13:47.516
- This is a library.
- Shh!

13:47.912 --> 13:49.311
What, really?

13:51.017 --> 13:53.017
Security, really?

13:53.538 --> 13:54.791
Aw, my keys.

13:54.816 --> 13:57.745
Dark complexion... excuse
me. Is this your car?

13:57.868 --> 14:00.937
Yes. Can you help me get my keys?

14:00.938 --> 14:02.938
Okay, yeah, she's
getting a little agitated.

14:02.948 --> 14:05.229
Call the police. Maybe they can
get my keys out of here.

14:05.254 --> 14:09.723
See? I have plenty of
reasons to go off every time.

14:10.094 --> 14:12.433
I'm sorry. You're right.

14:12.688 --> 14:13.769
Thank you.

14:13.794 --> 14:15.904
- It's just...
- It's just what?

14:16.622 --> 14:18.307
I still think there may be

14:18.332 --> 14:20.803
a better way to handle
certain situations.

14:20.828 --> 14:22.827
For me? Or for other people?

14:23.028 --> 14:25.473
Can't really control
other people's behavior,

14:25.768 --> 14:28.505
but you do catch more flies with honey.

14:28.908 --> 14:30.568
Well, go fuck yourself, honey.

14:32.598 --> 14:33.927
Cop it and go.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.944
I'll have the off-the-menu item, please.

14:38.413 --> 14:39.643
Roll with wisdom.

14:41.118 --> 14:42.847
I'll have the illegal stuff, please.

14:42.848 --> 14:44.517
- Illegal?
- Yeah, the illegal.

14:44.518 --> 14:45.917
Oh, I-I don't know
what you talking about.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.917
I only have what's on this menu, man.

14:47.918 --> 14:49.718
The block is hot right now, man.

14:49.728 --> 14:51.857
I like it hot. That's fine, Mr. Barker.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.657
Come on. The fuzz is on my back, man.

14:54.658 --> 14:56.927
- What?
- I got to lay low, man.

14:56.928 --> 14:58.928
Not right now. All eyes are on me.

14:59.538 --> 15:02.438
Come back later. Get!

15:06.214 --> 15:08.577
- Aah!
- Hey, Mr. Barker.

15:08.602 --> 15:10.332
Timmy, you scared the shit out of me!

15:10.548 --> 15:13.072
You told me to come back later.
Can I please have the goods now?

15:13.651 --> 15:15.850
I don't know, Timmy. I'm
looking in your eyes, man.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.323
You're just jonesing too hard.

15:17.348 --> 15:18.817
I'll pay you. I'll pay... I'll pay you.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.348
Timmy, I don't do this for the money.

15:20.358 --> 15:22.982
- I just love to cook.
- Please! I need this.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.357
Get yourself together, Timmy.

15:27.358 --> 15:30.594
- Busted, Mr. Barker.
- Aw, hell, nah!

15:31.046 --> 15:32.133
What is this?

15:32.158 --> 15:35.673
Chocolate M&M and Cocoa
Puff muffin, that's it.

15:35.698 --> 15:38.837
No, this is diabetes
on a plate, Mr. Barker.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.882
Follow me to my office.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.216
You're free to leave, Timothy.

15:44.076 --> 15:46.987
- Sorry you got fired, cuzzo.
- Thanks. You know what?

15:47.012 --> 15:48.951
I miss feeding the kids already, man.

15:49.118 --> 15:50.876
I just want a job with a purpose.

15:50.901 --> 15:53.742
What it sounds like is that
you need to work for you.

15:54.058 --> 15:55.717
Start your own restaurant, cuzzo.

15:55.718 --> 15:57.718
Man, you know my money
ain't long like that, Bobby.

15:57.728 --> 15:59.931
- I told you that.
- All right, all right, all right, so, look, listen.

15:59.955 --> 16:02.854
What if the restaurant had wheels?

16:05.798 --> 16:09.078
Yes. Yes! Do not tell Mullins.

16:09.103 --> 16:10.432
But I'm actually about to use

16:10.457 --> 16:11.997
something I learned
in one of his classes.

16:12.021 --> 16:14.183
I know where you going. Prop comedy.

16:14.208 --> 16:16.517
- You know something? The way you think...
- Yeah.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.971
...it's gotta be a disorder.

16:19.382 --> 16:20.629
Mullins is good.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.150
Did you see what he
did with the cucumber?

16:26.788 --> 16:29.356
- That's the one.
- Whoo-hoo!

16:30.270 --> 16:31.302
Look, I'm sorry, Tray.

16:31.327 --> 16:34.326
You don't qualify for the loan,
because you have no credit.

16:34.858 --> 16:36.458
Zero, zilch.

16:36.468 --> 16:38.527
I'm-a be straight with
you, man. I was locked up.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.267
I never had a credit card before.

16:40.268 --> 16:41.537
I'm just trying to get my life together.

16:41.538 --> 16:43.607
That's why I got to hit you with this.

16:43.632 --> 16:44.961
Bam.

16:45.413 --> 16:46.612
Business plan.

16:48.603 --> 16:50.612
Yeah, it's... interesting.

16:50.637 --> 16:51.773
Um...

16:51.798 --> 16:54.453
but, look, even if you qualify
for a loan for the truck,

16:54.478 --> 16:58.018
you're still looking at another
$50,000 for equipment and the permit.

16:58.043 --> 16:59.589
- Say what?
- Damn.

16:59.614 --> 17:01.214
All right, all right, I got this, cuzzo.

17:01.958 --> 17:03.140
Run my credit.

17:03.165 --> 17:05.463
Sure, yeah, um, what's the Social?

17:05.488 --> 17:07.227
All right, here we go.

17:07.228 --> 17:09.346
Here we go. One of these.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.194
All right... uh, oh, here a good one.

17:13.220 --> 17:15.017
This one's got a white last name.

17:16.650 --> 17:18.492
Okay, all right, you want the Jewish.

17:18.518 --> 17:20.049
Smickleson. Huh?

17:22.367 --> 17:24.032
Daniels, party of two?

17:25.983 --> 17:27.047
Hi.

17:27.048 --> 17:30.717
I wanted to apologize
again, about last night.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.717
So you thought inviting me
to my favorite restaurant

17:32.718 --> 17:34.392
would get you out of the doghouse?

17:34.417 --> 17:35.733
Yeah, I was hoping.

17:37.336 --> 17:38.368
You know what?

17:38.798 --> 17:42.861
If I'm being honest, I do
lose my temper sometimes.

17:43.928 --> 17:45.352
But you have to understand,

17:45.377 --> 17:47.551
there are plenty of times when I don't.

17:47.938 --> 17:49.733
It's not easy being a black woman.

17:49.758 --> 17:51.973
I can be mad about the same stuff that

17:51.998 --> 17:53.666
a white chick would be upset about,

17:53.691 --> 17:57.230
and people would consider
me to be angry or a bitch.

17:57.255 --> 17:59.924
I mean, I get it. I do. I really get it.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.039
No, you don't. And it's okay.

18:02.301 --> 18:03.673
If I had one black homegirl,

18:03.698 --> 18:06.097
I could be having this same
conversation with her right now,

18:06.122 --> 18:08.516
and she would understand
exactly where I'm coming from.

18:09.228 --> 18:10.317
But I just got you,

18:10.342 --> 18:13.643
and I need you to not worry
about what other people think

18:13.668 --> 18:16.137
and have my back whether
I'm right or wrong,

18:16.828 --> 18:18.197
because you're my husband.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.498
Now, come on. Let's eat.

18:25.108 --> 18:26.651
Right this way, please.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.208
Wait, didn't they come in after me?

18:33.233 --> 18:34.432
They sure did.

18:34.457 --> 18:37.256
I'm sorry, but I think
we were here before them.

18:37.518 --> 18:39.787
- I'm sorry, what is your name?
- It's Josh Birkeland.

18:40.388 --> 18:42.630
- They were before you.
- No, they weren't.

18:42.939 --> 18:46.630
I-I watched them come in after my wife.

18:46.747 --> 18:48.765
Okay, so this is unacceptable.

18:48.790 --> 18:50.103
This is unacceptable.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.261
You know what? We're leaving.

18:52.286 --> 18:53.286
- Honey?
- We are?

18:53.294 --> 18:55.170
Yeah, we're gonna leave.
We are gonna leave.

18:55.195 --> 18:57.964
This sucks! We come here a lot!

18:59.096 --> 19:00.192
Can I have a match?

19:01.387 --> 19:02.446
Thanks.

19:03.481 --> 19:04.486
Sorry!

19:06.549 --> 19:07.601
All right.

19:07.626 --> 19:10.825
Hey, how's that for not caring
what other people think, huh?

19:11.748 --> 19:13.427
- Was it a little too much?
- Yeah.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.651
I really wanted to eat there.

19:14.676 --> 19:17.422
Yes, me too. Sorry.

19:28.908 --> 19:32.592
- Yo, Tray, you gonna get up?
- What's the point?

19:33.378 --> 19:35.211
What happens to a dream deferred?

19:35.708 --> 19:38.068
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?

19:38.848 --> 19:41.957
Or does it fester like a sore, and run?

19:42.448 --> 19:43.743
Langston Hughes.

19:44.286 --> 19:45.298
Who?

19:45.940 --> 19:47.743
Barker, get in here.

19:55.837 --> 19:56.867
Sit down.

19:58.684 --> 19:59.743
Really?

20:00.598 --> 20:03.032
You lost your job in less than a week?

20:03.338 --> 20:05.167
I'll take the next job I can get.

20:05.559 --> 20:08.787
Well, may not be necessary.

20:11.008 --> 20:14.646
I found your business plan
in the trash can, and, uh...

20:14.671 --> 20:17.710
not bad.

20:19.088 --> 20:20.287
Come on. Follow me.

20:21.626 --> 20:22.795
Come on, dick licker.

20:23.888 --> 20:27.687
Oh, my God! You're
giving me a food truck?!

20:28.158 --> 20:30.097
I'm giving you a chance.

20:30.698 --> 20:32.767
Plus, I'm helping a friend
just clean out his salvage yard.

20:32.768 --> 20:34.191
You know, the truck was in an accident,

20:34.215 --> 20:35.239
and somebody may have died in there.

20:35.263 --> 20:36.358
I don't know, but... but, you know,

20:36.382 --> 20:38.937
he says he hears weird noises
coming from it at nighttime, but...

20:38.961 --> 20:40.826
anyway, it's yours.

20:40.851 --> 20:42.991
Mullins, you know my food is good, man.

20:43.016 --> 20:45.447
This is a moneymaker
waiting to happen, man.

20:45.448 --> 20:47.142
I'm a business owner!

20:47.167 --> 20:49.097
This is the proudest day of my life!

20:49.122 --> 20:50.257
You realize you're saying that

20:50.281 --> 20:52.550
standing in the back of a
halfway house in your drawers?

20:52.575 --> 20:55.122
Oh, come here, Mullins,
man. Give me some!
