00:00.275 --> 00:02.844
Previously on AMC's "The Son"...

00:03.879 --> 00:06.653
He'll need surgery in Austin.

00:06.656 --> 00:08.890
He led them to this doorstep.

00:08.893 --> 00:10.768
The sediciosos held me at gunpoint.

00:10.771 --> 00:12.638
Of course that's what you say now.

00:13.954 --> 00:15.731
I want you to apologize to Ramon.

00:15.734 --> 00:16.866
Now.

00:16.869 --> 00:19.904
His head is screwed on
backwards these days.

00:19.907 --> 00:21.806
Your daddy does not define you.

00:21.809 --> 00:24.110
You said we were just gonna scare him.

00:24.113 --> 00:26.179
Charles... I forgive you.

00:26.182 --> 00:27.320
Bring him up.

00:27.323 --> 00:30.103
No! No!

00:30.381 --> 00:33.575
The doctors say he's about six
weeks from being back on his feet.

00:33.578 --> 00:35.346
Oh, I've been thinking
about him all day.

00:35.349 --> 00:36.543
H-How's he doing?

00:36.578 --> 00:40.080
We've finally got him settled.

00:40.115 --> 00:44.184
Thank God, they let us
move him back to the house.

00:44.219 --> 00:46.219
He's doing better already.

00:48.791 --> 00:50.624
When are you and the kids coming up?

00:53.395 --> 00:54.761
Pete?

00:54.797 --> 00:56.196
I-I can't leave right now, Sal.

00:56.231 --> 00:57.566
Half our cattle are running loose,

00:57.568 --> 00:58.965
the house looks like a war zone.

00:59.001 --> 01:00.467
We got repairmen in
and out of here all day.

01:00.469 --> 01:02.803
Your son nearly died in the hospital!

01:04.772 --> 01:06.039
Don't do this.

01:06.075 --> 01:08.275
You haven't bothered to come see him.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.910
All the nurses just
assumed I was a widow

01:09.945 --> 01:11.244
'cause my husband wasn't there.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.315
If you got something to
tell me, try saying it plain.

01:16.418 --> 01:18.752
I want my kids here with me.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.654
Is that plain enough for you?

01:22.024 --> 01:23.990
These calls cost us a fortune.

01:24.026 --> 01:25.525
Goodbye.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.070
Any idea what this is about?

01:37.106 --> 01:38.839
No.

01:38.874 --> 01:40.774
Morning, fellas.

01:43.093 --> 01:44.759
Teo, what's going on?

01:50.552 --> 01:53.487
Mr. Pete, uh...

01:53.522 --> 01:56.089
I'm very sorry...

01:56.125 --> 01:58.959
but we're here to give notice.

02:00.796 --> 02:01.995
Notice?

02:04.133 --> 02:05.198
All of y'all?

02:05.234 --> 02:06.533
Si.

02:08.570 --> 02:11.204
Teo, you've been with
us, what, 20 years?

02:11.240 --> 02:13.974
Jorge, Tomas, you were
both born on this ranch.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.643
It's... It's too dangerous for us here.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.612
We've been through a rough stretch,

02:18.647 --> 02:20.781
no denyin' that, but we're
takin' precautions now.

02:20.816 --> 02:22.149
Things are gonna get better.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.483
Better?

02:23.519 --> 02:29.156
Mr. Pete, Ramon was hanged last night.

02:33.896 --> 02:36.463
We... We were sure you'd heard.

02:36.498 --> 02:37.531
No.

02:39.268 --> 02:40.467
No.

02:40.502 --> 02:42.702
Who done it?

02:42.738 --> 02:43.804
You know?

02:43.839 --> 02:45.839
The Law & Order League.

02:58.020 --> 03:00.086
Where were you last night?

03:15.537 --> 03:17.437
We should pay for the funeral.

03:17.473 --> 03:20.373
We'll do more than that.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.909
Ramon grew up here.

03:22.945 --> 03:25.045
We're gonna make sure
Luisa's taken care of

03:25.080 --> 03:27.447
and those kids get educated.

03:29.284 --> 03:31.618
You realize Niles is a
monster we helped create?

03:31.653 --> 03:33.053
You mean me.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.521
I'm not pointing fingers.

03:34.556 --> 03:36.590
I'm just sayin' we
can't let this pass by

03:36.625 --> 03:38.091
without taking some kinda action.

03:38.126 --> 03:42.128
I promise you, Niles Gilbert's
gonna suffer for this.

03:42.164 --> 03:43.597
But now is not the time.

03:43.632 --> 03:45.398
So when?

03:45.434 --> 03:48.101
Accounts will be balanced.

03:48.136 --> 03:49.236
You have my word.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.544
What do we do about Charles?

03:57.579 --> 03:59.546
Talk to the sheriff?

03:59.581 --> 04:02.048
Nobody knows he was there.

04:02.084 --> 04:03.884
Let's just leave it at that.

04:03.919 --> 04:06.419
Niles knows. All those
other jackasses know.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.022
Safe to say, they ain't talking.

04:11.293 --> 04:16.129
I think it's best to get
Charles out of town for a spell,

04:16.164 --> 04:18.331
let this thing settle down.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.437
I don't want to go to Austin.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.740
You wanna see your mama
and Jonas, don't you?

04:26.775 --> 04:28.575
Uncle Phineas?

04:28.610 --> 04:31.311
Why are we in such a rush?

04:31.346 --> 04:33.346
What aren't you telling me?

04:33.382 --> 04:35.148
Jeannie, please get in the truck.

04:35.183 --> 04:37.350
Not until somebody
tells me what's going on!

04:37.386 --> 04:38.184
Bug.

04:39.521 --> 04:41.296
Can't we wait for Granddaddy?

04:41.299 --> 04:43.029
Jeannie Anne McCullough, you
get in the truck right now,

04:43.031 --> 04:44.964
or I'll take a strip off your hide.

04:46.076 --> 04:47.141
Get.

04:59.408 --> 05:02.142
What the hell did you do?

05:47.366 --> 05:51.530

05:54.396 --> 05:58.233
_

07:52.601 --> 07:54.835
Didn't work.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.670
Cut your arms wrong.

08:03.779 --> 08:05.934
Will you show me how
to do it the right way?

08:07.550 --> 08:09.516
Don't think so. No.

08:09.552 --> 08:11.885
Please.

08:11.921 --> 08:13.387
Ingrid, you have to try.

08:13.422 --> 08:14.922
That's what we all have to do.

08:17.059 --> 08:20.394
It's easy for a boy to say that.

08:20.429 --> 08:22.596
For me, there's no future.

08:22.631 --> 08:25.365
Only thing I am good for is abuse.

08:26.702 --> 08:31.205
Whatever torture and humiliation
they can come up with.

08:34.977 --> 08:37.376
Then one day, I'll be pregnant.

08:42.818 --> 08:46.120
I promise to look after you.

08:46.155 --> 08:48.622
I reckon I can do a better job of that.

08:48.657 --> 08:51.325
You want to help me, Eli?

08:52.928 --> 08:54.428
Kill me.

08:54.463 --> 08:57.131
Right now. Please?

08:57.166 --> 08:59.168
Please, Eli?

08:59.171 --> 09:01.338
You're the reason I'm here.

09:02.539 --> 09:04.072
You owe me.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.708
Be a man and use your knife.

09:07.743 --> 09:08.809
Stop it!

09:11.413 --> 09:14.548
What are you afraid of?!

09:14.583 --> 09:16.962
That you'd have to pay my owners back?

09:17.001 --> 09:19.319
That you'd have to give
them a couple of horses?

09:19.321 --> 09:20.988
I don't have any horses.

09:41.811 --> 09:45.012
Captives get ransomed back
to the whites all the time.

09:45.047 --> 09:47.781
Especially girls.

09:47.817 --> 09:49.116
Won't matter.

09:51.053 --> 09:53.520
I'm not a virgin anymore.

09:55.791 --> 09:57.558
No one will want me.

09:59.995 --> 10:02.696
No one will marry me.

10:03.866 --> 10:05.365
I'll marry you.

10:09.171 --> 10:12.139
I mean, if n... If
nobody else wants you.

10:16.979 --> 10:19.513
You're crazy.

10:19.548 --> 10:21.515
Probably.

10:38.945 --> 10:41.054
_

10:41.117 --> 10:42.669
Maria, what are you doing?!

10:42.705 --> 10:44.638
Ramon's wife shouldn't
have to walk through town

10:44.673 --> 10:46.506
and see these flyers everywhere.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.141
Maria!

10:48.177 --> 10:49.710
This is... This is disgusting.

10:49.745 --> 10:52.613
Come on!

11:00.923 --> 11:02.055
Maria.

11:02.088 --> 11:03.339
_

11:03.413 --> 11:04.664
_

11:16.078 --> 11:19.280
Well, good morning, Widow García.

11:19.308 --> 11:20.707
You are starting your day

11:20.743 --> 11:23.043
with some destruction
of property, I see.

11:24.079 --> 11:27.114
You hanged a man, and now
you're throwing a party.

11:27.149 --> 11:30.350
Well, that's a...

11:30.394 --> 11:33.461
that's quite a serious accusation.

11:33.489 --> 11:34.955
The way I heard it,

11:34.990 --> 11:40.694
Ramon Sanchez ran afoul
of his sedicioso compadres.

11:40.729 --> 11:42.062
It is common knowledge

11:42.097 --> 11:44.398
that Mexicans are a violent race,

11:44.433 --> 11:47.100
descended from conquistadors.

11:52.241 --> 11:54.041
Tell me...

11:54.076 --> 11:57.878
How many Indians did
your ancestors butcher

11:57.913 --> 12:00.814
in order to acquire
that fine ranch of yours?

12:00.849 --> 12:01.949
That's tellin' her, Niles.

12:01.984 --> 12:03.917
Let the lady answer.

12:06.355 --> 12:08.322
I don't know.

12:08.357 --> 12:10.891
Probably as many as yours did.

12:10.926 --> 12:13.460
The difference being
that you've risen higher

12:13.495 --> 12:16.029
on the backs of the oppressed than I.

12:19.101 --> 12:23.270
And now you stand here before me

12:23.305 --> 12:27.774
and you malign my reputation
in front of my friends.

12:29.979 --> 12:32.612
If that is the character of a high-born,

12:32.648 --> 12:37.484
you can't blame the common
man for restoring the balance.

12:49.631 --> 12:50.931
You can keep those.

12:53.302 --> 12:54.267
Lord!

12:54.303 --> 12:56.646
We got boxes more.

13:15.097 --> 13:17.672
_

13:23.212 --> 13:25.045
What you got there?

13:26.515 --> 13:29.783
Just a gift for our young invalid.

13:32.688 --> 13:33.920
That's sweet.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.124
What happened?

13:39.361 --> 13:41.595
Pete and I aren't doing well.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.102
Tell you what.

13:49.138 --> 13:50.904
Get yourself dressed.

13:50.939 --> 13:52.918
After I give this to Jonas,
I'm taking you out to dinner.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.174
You can tell me everything.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.209
I don't know if I feel like going out.

13:56.245 --> 13:58.612
I'm not giving you a choice.

13:58.647 --> 14:00.414
Go on, now.

14:00.449 --> 14:02.916
Make yourself look pretty.

14:02.951 --> 14:04.751
Do not disappoint me.

14:10.993 --> 14:13.427
Hey! Hey!

14:13.462 --> 14:14.861
Hey!

14:14.897 --> 14:16.063
Ow!

14:16.098 --> 14:17.631
Why were you talking to Dirty Hair?

14:17.666 --> 14:19.599
- I was trying to make her feel better!
- Why?

14:19.635 --> 14:21.735
I'm trying to keep her
from killing herself.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.947
Ow! Stop doin' that!

14:23.950 --> 14:25.739
You're stupid!

14:25.774 --> 14:28.259
S-She's your slave. Don't
you want her to stay alive?

14:28.262 --> 14:30.711
She's my father's slave.

14:30.746 --> 14:33.313
_

14:33.348 --> 14:34.815
He's trying to meet my bride price

14:34.850 --> 14:37.217
so my father will let him marry me.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.351
Oh.

14:40.456 --> 14:43.223
It's better for us if she dies.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.525
Better for you, better for me.

14:54.940 --> 14:58.004
_

14:58.040 --> 14:59.606
A strong stallion.

14:59.641 --> 15:02.409
Make a good gift to
Prairie Flower's father.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.444
Good for them.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.836
Wohonuu Makwiyetu says
he'll collect 10 more

15:06.851 --> 15:09.249
and give those to her father, too.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.785
Does that make you angry?

15:11.802 --> 15:13.674
Not really.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.376
Stop lying.

15:15.411 --> 15:16.944
You want to kill him.

15:16.979 --> 15:19.747
You want Prairie Flower for yourself.

15:19.782 --> 15:23.117
And she wants you... I think.

15:24.553 --> 15:26.120
You can't fool me, Tiehteti.

15:26.155 --> 15:29.523
I'm smarter than you. Remember that.

15:29.558 --> 15:31.959
So what do I do?

15:31.994 --> 15:33.961
Her father's a kind man.

15:33.996 --> 15:36.296
He wants his daughter to be happy.

15:36.332 --> 15:37.865
I don't think he'll force her to marry

15:37.900 --> 15:40.200
if there's another warrior she loves.

15:40.236 --> 15:42.036
But I'm not a warrior.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.570
Well, now, you can become one.

15:43.606 --> 15:45.773
Take scalps, collect horses.

15:45.808 --> 15:49.610
Let the people know in your
heart, you're a Comanche.

15:49.645 --> 15:51.645
And stop talking to Dirty Hair.

15:53.682 --> 15:55.482
Her father has many wives.

15:55.518 --> 15:57.217
They're always hungry.

15:57.253 --> 15:59.486
You should take him some meat.

16:02.258 --> 16:04.425
Come on. I'll help you.

16:17.873 --> 16:20.409
_

16:20.880 --> 16:25.510
_

16:41.156 --> 16:42.722
Eli?

16:46.302 --> 16:48.068
Are you hungry?

16:50.072 --> 16:51.905
You look hungry.

16:53.742 --> 16:55.142
Here.

16:55.177 --> 16:58.178
It's from the buck you killed.

16:58.214 --> 16:59.913
You ain't my slave.

17:07.323 --> 17:09.556
You belong to Prairie Flower.

17:09.592 --> 17:12.326
You ain't got no business
giving away her food.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.435
Go!

17:17.486 --> 17:19.486
Stay away from me.

17:35.851 --> 17:38.986
Hurt you to say that?

17:39.021 --> 17:40.454
What does it matter?

17:42.591 --> 17:44.892
I know why you said it.

17:44.927 --> 17:46.693
That's why it matters.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.634
My father appreciated the deer.

17:56.705 --> 17:58.972
I'll come to your tipi tonight.

19:27.396 --> 19:30.564
Securing the future of our household.

19:47.173 --> 19:50.508
I have never eaten like that.

19:50.543 --> 19:53.911
Do you buy every dinner
date oysters and champagne

19:53.946 --> 19:55.479

19:55.515 --> 19:57.181

19:57.216 --> 19:58.182

20:00.419 --> 20:03.454

for the fine evening.

20:04.957 --> 20:06.357
Oh.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.162
Well, no. I just...

20:11.197 --> 20:13.564
Do we have to go back already?

20:13.599 --> 20:16.934
Oh, let's get a drink somewhere.

20:18.938 --> 20:21.405
Ah, one drink. There's a
good spot around the corner.

20:25.811 --> 20:29.280

20:29.315 --> 20:31.715

You refuse to dress like a widow.

Hey!

Jonas!

- Hey.

28:03.298 --> 28:05.098
Hi, Daddy.

28:05.134 --> 28:07.701
This is such a nice surprise.

28:07.736 --> 28:10.637
Mama's gonna be so sad she
wasn't here to greet ya.

28:10.672 --> 28:11.771
Where is she?

28:11.807 --> 28:13.707
Out with Uncle Phineas.

28:13.742 --> 28:16.143
Don't worry... Valentina's here.

28:16.178 --> 28:18.515
Well, let's send her home.

28:18.547 --> 28:21.114
You should be getting
to bed, don't you think?

28:21.150 --> 28:23.617
Jeannie, go find her, please.

28:23.652 --> 28:25.752
Yes, sir.

28:27.356 --> 28:30.557
Charles, hang back a minute.

28:30.592 --> 28:33.960
I thought... we were going to bed.

28:33.996 --> 28:36.263
You and I should have a word first.

28:39.034 --> 28:41.935
I don't know what I
can say to you, Charles.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.103
I'm sorry.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.671
"Sorry" don't help Ramon.

28:44.706 --> 28:47.274
Didn't you learn anything at the river?

28:47.309 --> 28:50.323
When the ranch got shot up?
You know how bad things are.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.146
You know better than getting
caught up with Niles Gilbert.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.115
I didn't know what was
gonna happen to Ramon.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.349
I really didn't.

28:56.385 --> 28:57.751
Then you weren't using your head.

28:57.786 --> 28:59.519
I couldn't stop it.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.435
I understand.

29:18.473 --> 29:20.407
I've been there, too.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.315
Hi.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.016
What a nice surprise.

29:30.052 --> 29:31.484
How long you staying?

29:31.520 --> 29:32.986
Were y'all at a party?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.388
Honey, what's wrong?

29:44.044 --> 29:45.611
So, that's it?

29:45.647 --> 29:48.014
He gets off scot-free?

29:48.049 --> 29:49.949
What did you want me to do?

29:49.984 --> 29:52.185
I don't know... Something.

29:52.220 --> 29:54.654
Make him go to church
and do charitable works...

29:54.689 --> 29:56.322
Some kind of penance.

29:58.226 --> 29:59.525
You don't agree?

29:59.561 --> 30:01.827
Sal, he's in agony... I promise you.

30:01.863 --> 30:03.930
Good. He should be.

30:06.434 --> 30:08.968
Don't look at me like that.

30:09.003 --> 30:13.306
He's surrounded by men who
think there's glory in violence.

30:13.341 --> 30:16.209
It's teaching him the wrong things.

30:30.258 --> 30:32.258
That's a gift for your daddy.

30:38.866 --> 30:41.534
I was thinking for his
40th, but I haven't decided.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.408
He can't even look at me.

30:51.212 --> 30:54.213
If that's the case, it's only
because he's seeing himself.

30:57.652 --> 30:58.718
What does that mean?

31:02.290 --> 31:06.125
After Everett and your grandma died,

31:06.160 --> 31:10.196
the Colonel kept your
daddy and me close.

31:10.231 --> 31:13.699
Just took us along
for everything he did.

31:13.735 --> 31:18.437
And we had a few real bad
years with cattle thieves.

31:18.473 --> 31:21.274
And the, uh, Colonel
took it real personal.

31:22.977 --> 31:27.613
Decided to rid the county
of all of its bad apples.

31:27.649 --> 31:31.017
And, of course, we were
there... at his side.

31:32.820 --> 31:34.654
When we caught someone,

31:34.689 --> 31:36.656
we strung a noose around their neck,

31:36.691 --> 31:38.891
sat 'em on a horse.

31:38.926 --> 31:42.061
Your daddy and I would slap
the horse on its backside.

31:44.299 --> 31:46.065
The guy would drop.

31:47.702 --> 31:49.669
Just hang there.

31:52.340 --> 31:57.910
I remember this one
time, tree limb broke...

31:57.945 --> 32:01.047
and the rustler just got dragged
by his neck through the brush.

32:04.285 --> 32:06.385
Your daddy ended up shooting the fella.

32:11.025 --> 32:13.025
He was 12 by then.

32:16.831 --> 32:20.766
I think something's
changed in you, Pete.

32:20.802 --> 32:23.803
And it's something you don't understand.

32:27.542 --> 32:30.843
And you won't let me near
enough to understand it, either.

32:33.381 --> 32:35.232
We can't live like this.

32:40.521 --> 32:42.021
I know.

32:44.992 --> 32:47.493
Look me in the eye, at least.

33:02.910 --> 33:04.410
Sal.

33:07.749 --> 33:09.415
It's fine.

33:12.053 --> 33:13.919
I'm fine.

33:24.932 --> 33:28.901
I never wanted any of this to happen.

33:28.936 --> 33:31.604
I thought everything bad I
went through when we were kids,

33:31.639 --> 33:33.038
all of it was gonna stop with me.

33:33.074 --> 33:36.942
I was... I was gonna
be the end of the line.

33:42.717 --> 33:44.083
I know it's killing you.

33:47.221 --> 33:50.156
But there's nothing I can do, is there?

33:54.228 --> 33:57.396
You're so sad that nobody can reach you.

34:01.936 --> 34:05.571
Are you happy here... In the city?

34:09.310 --> 34:10.810
Yeah.

34:14.282 --> 34:16.782
Then you and the kids should stay.

34:24.759 --> 34:27.659
You know...

34:27.695 --> 34:28.994
when we got married,

34:29.030 --> 34:31.197
I thought that we would
live here in Austin.

34:37.271 --> 34:39.103
We were 18.

34:44.545 --> 34:46.178
I didn't know you.

35:04.532 --> 35:06.365
Daddy?

35:47.708 --> 35:49.475
Where you going?

35:49.510 --> 35:51.143
Ranch.

35:51.178 --> 35:52.578
You all right to drive?

35:52.613 --> 35:54.413
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:54.448 --> 35:57.883
Why don't you spend the
night? Leave in the morning.

35:57.919 --> 36:00.553
I'd rather leave when it's
cool, clear my head a bit.

36:00.588 --> 36:02.755
Mm.

36:06.861 --> 36:08.193
I'll go with you, then.

36:08.229 --> 36:09.795
No.

36:11.032 --> 36:13.098
They need you here.

36:37.077 --> 36:38.210
Daddy?

36:41.148 --> 36:42.247
Hello?

36:53.060 --> 36:55.560
Mr. Pete?

36:55.596 --> 36:57.662
Are you all right?

36:57.698 --> 36:59.604
Go home, Inez.

36:59.642 --> 37:01.342
Tell the staff they got the day off.

37:07.650 --> 37:10.184
I wanna be alone. I'll see you tomorrow.

37:10.219 --> 37:11.752
Si, senor.

38:08.926 --> 38:11.126

38:13.477 --> 38:15.410
_

38:15.567 --> 38:19.448
_

38:19.510 --> 38:22.133
_

38:23.635 --> 38:25.136
_

38:25.769 --> 38:27.687
_

38:27.805 --> 38:31.620
_

38:32.685 --> 38:34.520
_

38:35.396 --> 38:38.274
_

38:40.318 --> 38:43.141
_

38:44.047 --> 38:47.450
_

38:47.550 --> 38:48.515
No.

38:50.152 --> 38:52.553
I'll fight you right
now, you piece of shit.

39:12.408 --> 39:14.208
Damn. Look at 'em all.

39:22.235 --> 39:24.158
_

40:03.759 --> 40:04.832
Hi.

40:04.871 --> 40:06.760
Hi.

40:06.796 --> 40:09.463
Did I wake you?

40:09.498 --> 40:11.398
No.

40:11.434 --> 40:13.734
Sorry. Uh, come in.

40:23.679 --> 40:25.345
What's going on?

40:27.329 --> 40:29.563
I came to say goodbye.

40:31.153 --> 40:32.519
Goodbye?

40:36.425 --> 40:38.209
My husband didn't die.

40:41.163 --> 40:42.963
Uh...

40:42.998 --> 40:45.432
It's a lie I told everyone. Just...

40:47.536 --> 40:49.670
But I don't want to lie to you.

40:52.141 --> 40:53.874
You're not a widow.

40:57.146 --> 40:59.313
My mother thinks I'm doomed...

40:59.348 --> 41:01.448
That I don't have a future.

41:03.319 --> 41:05.018
I don't know.

41:05.054 --> 41:07.054
She's probably right.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.633
No.

41:21.203 --> 41:22.836
That's...
