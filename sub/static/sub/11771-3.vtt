I'M TALKING.

00:34.333 --> 00:35.433

00:35.467 --> 00:36.733
SORRY, I WAS JUST
LISTENING TO MUSIC.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.067
YOU KNOW WHAT,

00:38.100 --> 00:39.933
YOU BETTER GET YOURSELF
A NEW GIRLFRIEND, ALRIGHT ?

00:39.967 --> 00:42.200
'CAUSE THIS ISN'T GONNA
LAST THAT MUCH LONGER.

00:42.233 --> 00:44.567
YEAH, WELL, WHOSE FAULT
IS IT THAT I DON'T HAVE

00:44.600 --> 00:46.000
A GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE,
LARRY ?

00:46.033 --> 00:47.800
HEY, I DID YOU A FAVOR,
THE PROBLEM IS

00:47.833 --> 00:49.967
IT'S HARD TO EVEN FIX YOU UP,
YOU'RE SO PARTICULAR.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.033
I WOULD LIKE TO BE WITH
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, YES.

00:52.067 --> 00:53.233
WHAT GUY WOULDN'T ?

00:53.267 --> 00:54.833
NOT ONLY DOES SHE HAVE
TO BE GOOD-LOOKING...

00:54.867 --> 00:56.967
BUT SHE'S GOING OUT
WITH A BLIND MAN.

00:57.000 --> 00:57.967
SO ?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.667
SHE HAS TO WAIT ON
HAND AND FOOT.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.067
SO ?

01:01.067 --> 01:04.567
WHAT MATTERS TO WOMEN IS
WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE OF A FELLA.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.533
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING INSIDE OF YOU, OKAY ?

01:07.567 --> 01:08.867
LET ME JUST
MAKE THAT CLEAR.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.767
YOU ARE THE MOST SUPERFICIAL MAN
I'VE EVER MET,

01:11.800 --> 01:13.900
BLIND OR SIGHTED, OKAY ?

01:13.933 --> 01:16.467
BE THAT AS IT MAY
IT'S JUST NOT THAT FAIR

01:16.500 --> 01:18.867
THAT PEOPLE GET TO
SEE HER AND I DON'T.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.100
SO YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S NOT FAIR THAT

01:20.133 --> 01:21.900
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT
SHE LOOKS LIKE EXCEPT YOU.

01:21.933 --> 01:23.900
RIGHT,
IT'S NOT FAIR.

01:23.933 --> 01:25.100
DID YOU GET
THE CORNERS ?

01:25.133 --> 01:26.500
ALRIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO ?

01:26.533 --> 01:28.133
I'M GONNA KEEP
MY EYES AND EARS OPEN.

01:28.167 --> 01:29.733

I CAN FIX YOU UP WITH.

HEALTHY THINGS.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.400
YOGURT, YOGA.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.533
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.233
HEY, I THOUGHT OF
SOME MORE YOS'.

03:06.267 --> 03:07.867

03:33.400 --> 03:34.900
GET IN THE FUCKING
FRONT SEAT, ALRIGHT ?

03:34.933 --> 03:36.400
YOU'RE NOT DRIVING ME AROUND
LIKE I'M A CHAUFFEUR.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.467
WE'RE TWO MINUTES
FROM THE REHEARSAL HALL.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.700
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PERSON
ASKS ANOTHER PERSON

03:40.733 --> 03:41.867
TO DRIVE THEM
AROUND LIKE THIS ?

03:41.900 --> 03:43.367
THIS IS THE KIND OF
MENTALITY IS WHAT'S...

03:43.400 --> 03:45.300
WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS
SO INSECURE THAT THEY HAVE

03:45.333 --> 03:46.800
TO MAKE SOMEBODY MOVE
INTO THE FRONT SEAT

03:46.833 --> 03:48.733
SO THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE
DRIVING SOMEBODY AROUND ?

03:48.767 --> 03:50.533
NO, THE KIND OF PERSON
THAT'S SO INSECURE THAT NEEDS

03:50.567 --> 03:52.167
TO BE DRIVEN AROUND
IN THE BACKSEAT,

03:52.200 --> 03:54.667
SUBLIMINALLY, THAT YOU
NEED ME TO DRIVE YOU AROUND ?

03:54.700 --> 03:57.067
WHY DO I HAVE TO LEAVE MY SEAT,
GO INTO THE FRONT SEAT ?

03:57.067 --> 03:59.133
BECAUSE I ASKED YOU TO SIT
IN THE FRONT SEAT OF MY CAR

03:59.167 --> 04:01.800
AND IT'S MY CAR
AND IF IT'S MY CAR,
I MAKE THE RULES, OKAY ?

04:01.833 --> 04:03.100
OH, YOU'RE
MAKING THE RULES ?

04:03.133 --> 04:04.533
WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY
BEEN THERE ALREADY.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.633
YES, VERY GOOD.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.133
OH, YOU CAN'T DRIVE WITH
SOMEBODY IN THE BACKSEAT.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.633
YOU'RE SUCH A BABY.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.067
YOU'RE A
GROWN MAN BABY.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.100

04:13.133 --> 04:14.700

MY LITTLE BABY SEAT FOR MY--

04:21.967 --> 04:24.567

04:24.600 --> 04:26.200

04:26.233 --> 04:28.767

04:28.800 --> 04:30.867
HERE WE GO,

04:30.900 --> 04:32.567
HEY, TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

NO, YOU KNOW WHAT
MAKES YOU A BABY ?

04:39.567 --> 04:40.500
WHAT ?

04:40.533 --> 04:41.633
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
A BIG STUPID BABY.

04:41.667 --> 04:42.867
OH, I'M A STUPID.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.433
LOOK AT THIS THING
YOU'RE WALKING AROUND WITH.

04:44.467 --> 04:45.600
A BIG SACK

05:23.100 --> 05:24.967

06:13.833 --> 06:16.467
COME ON, STEWART,
HOW'D YOU DO THE TRICK ?

06:16.500 --> 06:19.633
NO, MAGICIANS DON'T TELL PEOPLE
HOW THEY DO THEIR TRICKS.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.400
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE
NOT REALLY A MAGICIAN.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.833
OH, YEAH, I AM.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.600
WHAT, 'CAUSE YOU DO ONE TRICK,
THAT MAKES YOU A MAGICIAN ?

06:24.633 --> 06:26.067
DIDN'T I TRICK YOU ?

06:26.067 --> 06:30.667
WERE YOU A MAGICIAN BEFORE
YOU KNEW HOW TO DO THAT TRICK ?

06:30.700 --> 06:31.833
MMM, NOT REALLY.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.100
WELL, THAT'S, WHO TAUGHT
YOU HOW TO DO THE TRICK ?

06:34.133 --> 06:35.100
A MAGICIAN.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.833
OKAY, SO YOU
WEREN'T A MAGICIAN.

06:36.867 --> 06:39.500
A MAGICIAN TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO DO THE TRICK.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.167
MM-HMM.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.067
RIGHT ?YEAH.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.967
OKAY, SO I'M NOT
A MAGICIAN.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.300
NOW YOU'RE A MAGICIAN,
SO YOU TEACH ME HOW TO DO IT.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.733
I CAN'T, JUST 'CAUSE
YOU SAID, I AM A MAGICIAN.

06:47.767 --> 06:48.833
I CAN'T TEACH YOU.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.567
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT TRICK
BEFORE THE MAGICIAN

06:51.600 --> 06:52.533
TAUGHT IT TO YOU,
RIGHT ?

06:52.567 --> 06:53.433
YEAH.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.167
SO WHY DID
THE MAGICIAN TELL YOU ?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.067
HE CAN TELL THAT
I'M A MAGICIAN.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.333
WELL, YOU CAN TELL
THAT I'M A MAGICIAN.

06:58.367 --> 07:01.267
BUT I'M A MAGICIAN,
JUST NATURALLY A MAGICIAN.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.233
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

07:02.267 --> 07:03.800
I'M SAYING,
I'M NATURALLY A MAGICIAN.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.700
BUT YOU DON'T
KNOW ANY TRICKS.

07:05.733 --> 07:06.967
AND YOU'RE JUST NOT.

07:07.067 --> 07:09.067
I MEAN, SEE, BECAUSE
I'M A MAGICIAN,

07:09.067 --> 07:10.500
IF YOU WERE
NATURALLY A MAGICIAN,

07:10.533 --> 07:12.167
I'D FEEL THAT YOU WERE
NATURALLY A MAGICIAN.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.333
ARE YOU GONNA
TELL ME THIS TRICK ?

07:13.367 --> 07:15.633
NO.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.100
MAGICIANS DON'T
REVEAL THEIR SECRETS.

07:17.133 --> 07:19.067
FINE, I GOT TO GO.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.133
YOU GUYS ARE
A LOT ALIKE.

IT'S A HALLOWEEN PARTY.

07:38.367 --> 07:39.867
I'M NOT GONNA
WEAR A COSTUME.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.567

I ALWAYS HAVE
THE ENERGY, YEAH.

07:54.567 --> 07:55.667
CAN OF HURRAH.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.067
CAN OF HURRAH.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.300
SO I'M THINKING ABOUT,
JENNA JAMESON, YOU KNOW ?

08:00.333 --> 08:01.333
WHO'S SHE ?

08:01.367 --> 08:03.167
A PORN STAR,
WAY HOT.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.733
AND, UM, ALL OF
A SUDDEN, SHE POPS OUT.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.600
YOU KNOW WHO POPS IN, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

08:07.633 --> 08:08.833
CHERYL.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.567
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ?

08:10.600 --> 08:11.867
MY WIFE ?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.167
CHERYL, YEAH.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.633
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU USED...

08:19.667 --> 08:22.133
YEAH, SHE WAS THERE
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

08:22.167 --> 08:25.433
BOOM, SHE WAS THERE,
YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHO POPS IN.

08:25.467 --> 08:26.367
SHE POPS IN.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.267
SHE POPS IN ?

08:27.300 --> 08:28.367
WELL, WHY DIDN'T
YOU POP HER OUT ?

08:28.400 --> 08:30.533
I TRIED POPPING HER OUT,
SHE WOULDN'T POP OUT.

08:30.567 --> 08:32.067
WHAT, SHE INSISTED
ON STAYING ?

08:32.067 --> 08:33.200
NOT EXACTLY.

08:33.233 --> 08:34.733
I WANT TO BE HERE
WITH YOU, JEFF ?

08:34.767 --> 08:36.067
I COULDN'T POP HER OUT,
I'M NOT IN CONTROL OF IT.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.667
BESIDES, MY BENCH
IS KIND OF THIN.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.867
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A LOT GOING ON THERE.

08:38.900 --> 08:39.867
OH, YOUR BENCH
IS THIN ?

08:39.900 --> 08:41.233
WHAT, IS SHE
ON YOUR TEAM NOW ?

08:41.267 --> 08:43.333
NO, SHE'S NOT ON MY TEAM,
SHE POPPED IN.

08:43.367 --> 08:45.400
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
USING MY WIFE FOR ?

08:45.433 --> 08:46.600
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE FLATTERED.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.067
FLATTERED ?
I'M FUCKING NAUSEOUS.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.400
WHAT, NAUSEOUS,
WHY'D YOU BE NAUSEOUS ?

08:49.433 --> 08:50.633
IT'S... UGH.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.900
YOU, MY WIFE, I JUST
DON'T LIKE THE WHOLE IDEA.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.067
IT DIDN'T
REALLY HAPPEN.

08:55.100 --> 08:59.467
I KNOW, BUT IT FEELS,
BUT YOU USED, IN YOUR MIND.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.267
OKAY.

09:01.300 --> 09:01.933
ALRIGHT.

09:01.967 --> 09:02.667
DO ME A FAVOR,
OKAY ?

09:02.700 --> 09:04.333
WHAT ?

09:04.367 --> 09:07.467
I DON'T WANT YOU USING
MY WIFE ANYMORE FOR THAT, OKAY ?

09:07.500 --> 09:09.800
I'LL NEVER INTENTIONALLY
USE YOUR WIFE FOR THAT.

09:09.833 --> 09:10.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"INTENTIONALLY" ?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.200
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
WHO POPS IN.

09:12.233 --> 09:13.733
YEAH, OKAY.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.367
NEXT TIME SHE POPS IN,

09:15.400 --> 09:17.200
PICK YOUR PANTS UP
AND GET OUT OF THE ROOM.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.100
HELLO.

09:23.133 --> 09:24.367
HOW YOU DOING ?

09:24.400 --> 09:25.633
VERY WELL,
THANK YOU.

09:25.667 --> 09:26.867
GOOD, HOW'S THE ADOPTION
COMING, GOOD ?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.667
UH, YES.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.267
IT'S GOING VERY WELL,
THANK YOU.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.767
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.833
WAIT TILL YOU GET THE KID, IT'S
GONNA CHANGE YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

09:33.867 --> 09:36.800
"GET THE KID" ?

09:36.833 --> 09:40.933
MEL WILL BE WITH YOU
IN JUST A SECOND,

09:40.967 --> 09:42.067
YOU CAN GO ON BACK.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.500
OKAY.

09:43.533 --> 09:46.933
HOW YOU DOING ?

09:50.400 --> 09:53.133
YOU'RE CARRYING ON
LIKE IT'S A FUNERAL.

09:53.167 --> 09:54.833
BUT THAT'S WHAT
IT IS, TO ME.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.433
IT'S A DECISION.

09:56.467 --> 09:56.933
HEY.

09:56.967 --> 09:57.767
HEY.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.133
LARRY, JEFF,
COME IN, COME IN.

09:59.167 --> 10:00.567
CLOSE THE DOOR, PLEASE.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.833
DO YOU HAVE
ANY COMPLAINTS ?

10:02.867 --> 10:04.567
I MEAN, HOW'S IT
GOING FOR YOU ?

10:04.600 --> 10:08.900
I'VE GOT ONE TINY THING,
JUST ONE SMALL ISSUE.

10:08.933 --> 10:12.233
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE TOILET
PAPER IN THE REHEARSAL HALL.

10:12.267 --> 10:13.767
YOU'RE GONNA
GET THE SOFTEST,

10:13.800 --> 10:16.200
MOST BEAUTIFUL TOILET PAPER,
YOU'LL BE SO HAPPY

10:16.233 --> 10:18.667
YOU'LL BE HANGING AROUND
THE TOILET EVERYDAY.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.667
YOU'LL GET ME
THE SOFTER ROLLS ?

10:19.700 --> 10:20.133
YOU GOT IT !

10:20.167 --> 10:21.467
ALRIGHT.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.167
MEL, CAN WE GET TO WHY YOU
ASKED LARRY TO COME HERE ?

10:23.200 --> 10:25.500
OH, YEAH, WE HAVE
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

10:25.533 --> 10:26.400
YEAH, RIGHT.

10:26.433 --> 10:30.200
BEN STILLER
IS GONE.

10:30.233 --> 10:32.633
HE IS HISTORY,
HE HAS LEFT US.

10:32.667 --> 10:37.867
HE CAME TO ME AND SAID,
IT'S EITHER ME OR LARRY DAVID.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.300
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

10:39.333 --> 10:43.267
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WENT RIGHT
LARRY DAVID, STILLER OUT.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.833
HE COMPLAINED ABOUT SOME THINGS,
I DON'T KNOW, MINOR STUFF.

10:45.867 --> 10:46.967
YOU'RE KIDDING.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.867
NO, WE'RE NOT KIDDING,
BEN STILLER QUIT.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.600
YOU WOULDN'T SIT
IN THE FRONT OF A CAR.

10:50.633 --> 10:52.800
YOU COULDN'T MOVE INTO
THE FRONT OF THE CAR ?

10:52.833 --> 10:54.500
I MEAN, I HAVE
TO MOVE UP TO,

10:54.533 --> 10:56.367
WE WERE TWO MINUTES AWAY
FROM WHERE WE WERE GOING.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.267
THEY WERE TWO MINUTES AWAY
FROM WHERE THEY WERE GOING.

10:58.300 --> 11:01.633
AT BEN STILLER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,
YOU DIDN'T BRING A PRESENT.

11:01.667 --> 11:02.833
HE SAID, NO GIFTS.

11:02.867 --> 11:05.833
THEY ALWAYS SAY NO GIFT,
BUT EVERYBODY BRINGS A GIFT.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.933
SO, YOU'RE AT THE SHOW,
YOU WON'T SHAKE HIS HAND.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.433
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A SMALL PHOBIA

11:10.467 --> 11:13.067
ABOUT SHAKING PEOPLE'S HANDS
WHO HAVE SNOT ON IT, THAT'S ALL.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.900
IT'S A SMALL THING,
IT'S A TEENY LITTLE PHOBIA.

11:14.933 --> 11:17.067
AND AT THE BIRTHDAY PARTY,
EVERYBODY SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.633
I DON'T LIKE
THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG.

11:18.667 --> 11:19.600
I DON'T SING
THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.133
HE NEVER SINGS
THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.467
I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER,
I HATE THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.867
IT'S A TRITE,
CLICHé SONG.

11:24.900 --> 11:25.967
I HATE IT.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.567
DID YOU HEAR THIS THING
WITH THE SHISH KABOB ?

11:27.600 --> 11:28.633
OKAY, YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT ?

11:28.667 --> 11:29.867
THAT'S PAINFUL.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.400
HE'S STROKING,
SHOWING A STROKE...

11:31.433 --> 11:32.533
OH, IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.567
RIGHT INTO
THE KID'S EYE.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.567
BY THE WAY,
CAN I SAY SOMETHING ?

11:35.600 --> 11:36.267
PLEASE.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.333
MEL ?

11:37.367 --> 11:39.267
BLESSING
IN DISGUISE.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.700
OKAY, HE'S A WONDERFUL ACTOR,
HE'S A FANTASTIC ACTOR.

11:41.733 --> 11:44.467
I DON'T THINK HE BELONGS
IN MUSICAL COMEDY, FRANKLY.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.400
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT,
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

11:46.433 --> 11:47.767
EVERYTHING WILL
WORK OUT BEAUTIFULLY.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.067
ALRIGHT.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.733
SO, UH, SO YOU'LL WORK ON
THE TOILET PAPER THING ?

11:51.767 --> 11:52.767
DONE, DONE.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.967
PINK, PINK, BLUE, SOFT,
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

11:55.067 --> 11:55.933
YOU GOT IT,
I LOVE IT.

11:55.967 --> 11:57.267
BLUE, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT BLUE.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.567
LISTEN, YOU KNOW, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT BEN STILLER.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.833
IN MY MIND, I'VE GOT A COUPLE
OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND,

12:04.867 --> 12:06.533
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO
YOU THINK OF, UH,

12:06.567 --> 12:08.067
DO YOU KNOW
DAVID SCHWIMMER ?

12:08.100 --> 12:09.333
SURE, YEAH
THE GUY FROM FRIENDS ?

12:09.367 --> 12:10.533
YEAH.

12:10.567 --> 12:11.533
NOW THINK ABOUT THAT GUY,
THINK ABOUT THAT.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.433
HE CAN MOVE WELL,
SINGS WELL.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.567
AND WE'D SAVE A LITTLE MONEY
ON THE MARQUEE.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.233
LARRY DAVID SCHWIMMER,
GET IT ?

12:18.267 --> 12:19.767
OKAY, BAD JOKE.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.133
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
I LIKE THAT.

12:21.167 --> 12:22.933

THE GOOD WORK.

12:26.700 --> 12:30.433
MEL, YOU'RE MAKING
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.833
I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS GUY.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.267
HE'S MENTALLY
CHALLENGED.

12:34.300 --> 12:37.833
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS MIDDLE-AGED BALD GUY

12:37.867 --> 12:39.100
THAT IS THRILLING !

12:47.933 --> 12:48.700

PUTTING IT IN MY POCKET, OKAY.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.233
NOTHING'S COMING OFF THIS.

13:15.833 --> 13:19.500
( car horn honking )

13:22.167 --> 13:23.600
YOUR FOOT'S WET
AND YOU'RE ON...

13:23.633 --> 13:24.533
OH, SORRY.

13:24.567 --> 13:26.233
YOU'RE ON THE SEAT.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.967
COULD YOU CLOSE THE DOOR 'CAUSE
YOU'RE SPRAYING IT OVER INSIDE.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.767
IT LOOKS PRETTY
CLEAN IN HERE.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.267
AH, IT'S DUSTY.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.667
YOU'RE MAKING A MESS.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.067
YOU'RE MAKING IT
A BIGGER MESS THAN IT WAS.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.500
I THINK
IT'S OKAY NOW.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.733
NO, IT AIN'T LOOKING
LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.067
I GUESS I'LL
GET GOING NOW.

13:52.067 --> 13:55.633
NO, NO, JUST GIVE ME, LIKE,

14:18.133 --> 14:20.167
YOU LEFT NO GAS

14:20.200 --> 14:22.700
HOW DO YOU DRIVE
AROUND LIKE THAT ?

14:22.733 --> 14:24.733
I DON'T KNOW.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.500
AND I'M NOWHERE
NEAR A GAS STATION.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.767
I GOT TO PEE SO BAD.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.067

YOUR CAR WASHED.

14:38.167 --> 14:40.933

14:40.967 --> 14:43.700
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
SO BAD, I'M DYING.

14:43.733 --> 14:45.867

HI, SIR.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.733

15:32.800 --> 15:34.900

15:34.933 --> 15:36.333
WHY WOULD I LET

15:36.367 --> 15:38.067

25:32.567 --> 25:34.067
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.600
I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.700
LARRY HAS JUST SORT OF
PRAISED YOU TO THE SKIES.

25:37.733 --> 25:39.233

27:17.467 --> 27:19.967
YOU BENT IT SO
YOU COULD PEEK AT IT.

27:20.067 --> 27:22.067
YOU HAD TO LOOK AT IT
FROM BEHIND.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.333
HOW'D YOU KNOW ?

27:23.367 --> 27:25.467

27:55.500 --> 27:57.733
LARRY DAVID ?

28:07.800 --> 28:10.800
