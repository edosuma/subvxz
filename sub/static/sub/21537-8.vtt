- YOU'RE GONNA GET ME
$700,000 MORE PER UNIT

00:11.778 --> 00:12.946
BECAUSE OF THESE UPGRADES?

00:12.979 --> 00:14.781
- THAT'S CORRECT.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.550
- AT THIS PRICE,
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

00:17.584 --> 00:18.685
IT'S TOO HIGH.

00:18.718 --> 00:20.453
- I'M GONNA SAY,
"YES, LET'S DO IT,"

00:20.487 --> 00:23.423

THAT I AM NOT HAPPY.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.159

- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.221
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.556
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

00:56.589 --> 00:57.991
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

00:58.024 --> 01:00.393
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:21.114 --> 01:25.352
HE'S GONNA BE SO PISSED.

01:25.385 --> 01:29.356
MY LISTING AT ONE BEACON COURT
HAS BECOME A NIGHTMARE.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.424
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.659
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
- YEAH, COME ON IN.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.260
THIS LISTING
CAME FROM MARK,

01:34.294 --> 01:36.796
AND MARK HAS
A SPECIAL HATE FOR ME

01:36.830 --> 01:39.399
BECAUSE I PLEDGED HIM
IN OUR FRATERNITY IN COLLEGE.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.935
- BEFORE I SIGN ANYTHING,
LET'S DO THREE THINGS.

01:41.968 --> 01:44.204
- SO MARK PUT ME THROUGH
A BUNCH OF SHENANIGANS

01:44.237 --> 01:45.372
TO GET THE LISTING.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.873
THIS IS REALLY TO SELL
THIS APARTMENT?

01:46.906 --> 01:48.241
- I MEAN, YOU WANT ME
TO SIGN THIS PAPER, RIGHT?

01:48.274 --> 01:49.242
- YEAH.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.845
AND AFTER
WORKING MY ASS OFF,

01:51.878 --> 01:55.315
SERGEI, THE RUSSIAN BROKER,
USED MY DEAL...

01:55.348 --> 01:57.317
7 MILLION, ALL CASH.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.353
- TO LEVERAGE A BETTER DEAL
TWO FLOORS UP...

02:04.724 --> 02:06.726
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME,
NOT ON THIS APARTMENT.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.631
THEN HAD THE AUDACITY
TO PULL OUT

02:11.664 --> 02:13.066
RIGHT BEFORE GOING
TO CONTRACT.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.902
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A REAL ESTATE BROKER.

GO TO VOICE MAIL.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.616
HEY, MARK.
IT'S RYAN.

02:29.649 --> 02:34.754
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE BROKER FOR OUR BUYER.

02:34.788 --> 02:38.291
UM, AND APPARENTLY,
THEY WERE OFFERING

02:38.324 --> 02:40.727

UNBEKNOWNST TO ME,

02:40.760 --> 02:44.698
ON ANOTHER APARTMENT
ON A HIGHER FLOOR.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.500
AND THEY USED
OUR OFFER

02:47.534 --> 02:51.404
TO GET
A BETTER DEAL UPSTAIRS.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.107

I--

03:08.421 --> 03:11.057
I UNDERSTAND, AND I UNDERSTAND
YOUR FRUSTRATION.

03:11.057 --> 03:14.961

I'M OBSESSED WITH TEA.

03:43.256 --> 03:46.226
YOU KNOW, I DRINK
TEN GREEN TEA MATCHA EVERY DAY.

03:46.259 --> 03:47.594
- THAT'S BAD FOR YOU.
[laughs]

03:47.627 --> 03:48.728
- ANYWAY, IT MAKES ME GO,

03:48.762 --> 03:50.797
AND IT MAKES ME DO

04:03.343 --> 04:06.246
- NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:06.279 --> 04:08.615
- [slurps]
[sighs]

04:08.648 --> 04:10.550
- THIS IS VERY FINE LEAF.
- BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA LAST ME.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.252
THAT'LL ONLY LAST--THAT'S
GONNA LAST ME, LIKE, ONE DAY.

04:12.285 --> 04:14.821
- THIS MAKES 30 CUPS.
- LET'S BUY A FEW, FIVE.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.605
HI, EDMUND.
HOW ARE YOU?

04:32.639 --> 04:34.541
EDMUND LI
IS A CURRENT CLIENT OF MINE.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.743
A DEVELOPER
OF 111 MERCER.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.713
I CONVINCED HIM TO LET ME
PICK HIS FINISHES.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.247
AND THEN, I PROMISED HIM
IN RETURN

04:41.281 --> 04:44.751
THAT I WOULD GET HIM $700,000
MORE PER UNIT

04:44.784 --> 04:45.852
THAN OTHER BROKERS.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.220
I MEAN, THESE
ARE RECORD NUMBERS,

04:47.253 --> 04:50.090
AND TO GET RECORD NUMBERS,
I HAVE TO WORK HARDER

04:50.090 --> 04:51.324
THAN I'VE EVER
WORKED BEFORE.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.360
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.097
WELL, I HAD
AN OPEN HOUSE,

04:57.097 --> 04:59.332
SORT OF A PREVIEW FOR
ALL THE BROKERS THAT I LIKE.

04:59.366 --> 05:03.570
AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY
RESPONDING WELL TO THE FINISHES.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.775
WELL, UM, I--
I FEEL IT.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.044
I FEEL AN OFFER COMING.
I C--I CAN SENSE IT.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.046
TRUST ME.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.516
I UNDERS--
I--EDMUND.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.818
- WE HAVE TO CLOSE.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.922
- OKAY.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.428
LOUD AND CLEAR.
I GOT IT.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.529
THANK YOU.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.830
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
I'M GONNA USE

05:30.864 --> 05:32.565
ALL THE MATCHA
I CAN BUY.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.634
- 68.85.
- OOH, OKAY.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.836
I UNDERSTAND
EDMUND'S URGENCY HERE.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.738
A NEW DEVELOPMENT,
YOU ALWAYS WANNA SELL

05:38.772 --> 05:40.106
THE FIRST UNIT QUICKLY.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.142
MY STRATEGY HERE
IS TO CALL EVERY BROKER

05:42.175 --> 05:45.078
THAT PREVIEWED THE SPACE
AND CALL THEM IN

05:45.111 --> 05:47.414
FOR A REAL SHOWING
WITH A REAL BUYER.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.650
BYE, DOROTHY.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.653
[upbeat techno]

05:53.687 --> 06:00.927
* *

06:01.027 --> 06:02.495
- MOST OF THE APARTMENTS
IN THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT

06:02.529 --> 06:04.864
ARE STRAIGHT-UP HIGH-RISES
WITH ALL THE AMENITIES,

06:04.898 --> 06:07.033
FROM GYM, POOLS, LOUNGES.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.036
NOW, 54 PINE STREET'S COMPLETELY
THE OPPOSITE OF ALL THAT.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.039
IT'S A--IT'S A VERY SIMPLE
FIVE-STORY BUILDING

06:13.039 --> 06:15.408
THAT HAVE NO DOORMAN,
NO GYM, NO POOLS,

06:15.442 --> 06:17.043
NO AMENITIES WHATSOEVER.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.312
SO IT'S A VERY TOUGH PLACE
TO SELL.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.449
THIS IS PRICED A LITTLE BIT
ABOVE $800 A FOOT.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.484
- [sighs]

06:27.220 --> 06:30.657
- THEY ALL THINK THIS APARTMENT
IS PRICED TOO HIGH.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.792
IT'S ALWAYS A STRESSFUL TASK
TO SIT IN FRONT OF AN OWNER

06:32.826 --> 06:34.894
AND TELL THEM THAT YOU HAVE
TO DROP YOUR PRICE.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.596
AND MARI
IS VERY TOUGH.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.832
AT THIS PRICE,
AT 1,350,000,

06:38.865 --> 06:40.133
IT'S NOT GOING
TO WORK.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.167
- I'M GONNA SAY YES,

06:41.201 --> 06:44.537
BUT UNDERSTAND
THAT I AM NOT HAPPY.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.873
- AND SINCE LOWERING THE PRICE
TO 1,299,000,

06:46.906 --> 06:49.075
I HAVE BEEN GETTING
SHOWING REQUESTS LEFT AND RIGHT.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.643
I CAN BARELY EVEN
HANDLE THEM.

06:50.677 --> 06:54.080
SOMETIMES,
EVEN A $50,000 DROP

06:54.114 --> 06:58.551
CAN TURN A VERY STALE APARTMENT
INTO A HOT COMMODITY TODAY.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.053
- THERE HE IS.
- HI, LUIS, HOW ARE YOU?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.255
- LUIS, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- BENOIT, NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.323
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
- BENOIT.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.158
- OH, BENOIT.
PLEASE, WELCOME.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.226
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE YOU? LUIS.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.293
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- PLEASURE.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.828
- KATIE, HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY, LUIS.

07:08.862 --> 07:09.929
GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WELL.
- PLEASURE.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.332
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
LUIS, NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.335
SO THIS IS 54 PINE STREET,
APARTMENT NUMBER 4.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.237
IT'S 1,638 SQUARE FEET.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.672
IT'S TWO BEDROOM,
TWO BATHROOM.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.407
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
LIVING IN THE WEST VILLAGE

07:20.440 --> 07:22.042
FOR THE PRICE
OF THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.210
EVERYTHING IS VERY ORIGINAL.
YOU HAVE THE EXPOSED BRICK.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.046
YOU HAVE THE VAULTED CEILINGS,
12 FEET.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.914
THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS LAYOUT
IN PARTICULAR

07:27.947 --> 07:29.683
IS THAT THE LIVING ROOM
IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE,

07:29.716 --> 07:31.217
BUT WAY SEPARATE
FROM THE BEDROOM.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.452
SO IT'S VERY QUIET.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.121
THIS IS
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.756
- BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT?
- DEFINITELY FOR A MASTER, HUH?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.259
- YES.
THIS IS THE MASTER BATHROOM.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.061
ONLY ONE PERSON
HAS LIVED IN HERE,

07:41.094 --> 07:42.462
AND THE OWNERS
ARE EXTREMELY CLEAN.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.897
I MEAN, THEY'RE PUERTO RICAN.
I'M PUERTO RICAN.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.465
I'M VERY CLEAN.
- PUERTO RICANS ARE CLEANER?

07:45.498 --> 07:47.934
- YES.
[chuckles]

07:47.967 --> 07:49.069
- YOU LEARN SOMETHING
EVERY DAY.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.070
[chuckles]

07:50.070 --> 07:52.205
- I NOTICE
THE UNUSUAL SMELL.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.340
DO YOU...

07:53.373 --> 07:55.141
- SMELL?
IT SMELLS LIKE HOME.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.744
- IT SMELLS LIKE HOME.
- YES, IT SMELLS LIKE HOME.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.013
AND IT CAN BE YOURS
IF YOU MAKE A MOVE TONIGHT.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.247
[chuckles]

08:01.281 --> 08:03.283
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GUYS.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, LUIS.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.417
- LIKEWISE.
- TAKE CARE.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.186
<i>- CIAO, CIAO.</i>

08:06.219 --> 08:09.923
[sniffs]
WHAT THE [bleep]?

08:12.525 --> 08:15.528
I LIKE THIS SMELL.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.303
- AW, BABE.
[sighs]

08:23.336 --> 08:25.405
WE HAVE TO ASSIGN
THE ROOMS.

08:25.438 --> 08:26.639
WE HAVE
TO DO THAT TONIGHT.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.675
I MEAN, WHO KNEW
PLANNING A WEDDING

08:28.708 --> 08:30.443
WOULD BE
SO EXHAUSTING?

08:30.477 --> 08:32.479
- ARE WE GONNA DO
A TRADITIONAL WEDDING CAKE?

08:32.512 --> 08:34.914
- IT HAS TO HAVE TWO GUYS
ON TOP.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.183
- TWO GUYS, OKAY.
WELL, UH--

08:37.217 --> 08:38.418
- YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE,
LIKE--PLBBT.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.387
- I WOULDN'T EXPECT
ANYTHING ELSE.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.122
- IN ADDITION TO ALL THE WORK
I HAVE FOR EDMUND

08:42.155 --> 08:44.657
AT 111 MERCER,
I'M SPENDING EVERY FREE MOMENT

08:44.691 --> 08:47.060
WITH DEREK,
PLANNING OUR WEDDING.

08:47.093 --> 08:51.531
AND, UM,
THIS THING ABOUT,

08:51.564 --> 08:53.199
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
GETTING MARRIED

08:53.233 --> 08:54.968
AND WE'RE JUST
GONNA SHARE EVERYTHING,

08:55.068 --> 08:58.338
AND, I GUESS,
UH, OUR FINANCES TOO?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.573
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

09:00.607 --> 09:03.510
BECAUSE WHENEVER I TALK
TO MY FRIENDS,

09:03.543 --> 09:07.714
IT'S, LIKE, "FREDRIK,
YOU HAVE TO GET A PRENUP."

09:07.747 --> 09:09.049
- YEAH, I KNOW
A PRENUP.

09:09.082 --> 09:12.652
IT'S FOR COUPLES
THAT DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.221
IT'S THE LAST THING
I EVEN THOUGHT OF.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.389
- WELL, I MEAN--

09:16.423 --> 09:19.159
- I MEAN, HAVE YOU GIVEN IT
MUCH THOUGHT?

09:19.192 --> 09:20.694
- WELL, NO.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.263
BUT, I MEAN, I--OTHER PEOPLE
SEEM TO BE THINKING FOR ME.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.597
SO...

09:24.631 --> 09:26.399
- WELL, I JUST THINK
IT'S A VERY CYNICAL THING.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.134
TO ME, IT JUST TAINTS
THE WHOLE IDEA

09:28.168 --> 09:29.302
OF US GETTING MARRIED.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.737
IT'S JUST, LIKE,
YOU'RE GOING INTO IT

09:30.770 --> 09:32.305
WITHOUT TRUSTING
EACH OTHER.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.040
- I KNOW, AND I UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM,

09:34.040 --> 09:35.742
AND I'M TRYING TO SEE
BOTH SIDES.

09:35.775 --> 09:36.843
- IT JUST MAKES ME
REALLY ANGRY

09:36.876 --> 09:38.144
THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.681
- BUT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE THIS COMPANY IN SWEDEN.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.850
- I MEAN, WHAT'S--WHAT--
WHAT ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF?

09:43.883 --> 09:46.252
WHAT ARE THEY
WARNING YOU AGAINST?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.354
THAT I WOULD TAKE HALF?

09:47.387 --> 09:48.922
- I THINK YOU ARE ENTITLED
TO HALF.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.690
YOU WILL BE.
THE DAY WE GET MARRIED--

09:50.724 --> 09:52.359
- THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE
TO TRUST IN ME

09:52.392 --> 09:55.195
THAT I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE
FROM YOU OTHER THAN YOU,

09:55.228 --> 09:57.897
AND I MEAN THAT.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.400
- I HAVEN'T CONTACTED A LAWYER.
I HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF IT.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.903
BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,

10:03.937 --> 10:06.006
THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU MIND
SIGNING THE PAPERS?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.541
- THERE IS SOME DOUBT
IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.609
THAT'S THE ISSUE
I HAVE

10:09.642 --> 10:11.644
ABOUT SIGNING A PIECE
OF BLOODY PAPER.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.513
THIS IS NOT
A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

10:13.546 --> 10:17.017
YOU'RE GOING INTO.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.418
- MARRIAGE
IS A CONTRACT.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.353
- MARRIAGE IS A CELEBRATION
OF LOVE AND COMMITMENT,

10:20.387 --> 10:21.621
SO YOU GET A PIECE OF PAPER
TO SAY--

10:21.654 --> 10:22.956
- BABE, I KNOW THAT.
- A PRENUP IS ACTUALLY SAYING--

10:22.989 --> 10:25.091
- AND--AND I WANNA CELEBRATE,
AND I WANNA BE HAPPY,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.793
AND I WANNA BE IN LOVE
AND ALL THOSE THINGS.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.230
BUT--LIKE, IT HAPPENS TO BE
ALSO A CONTRACT.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.365
- I-I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT
AND I'M NOT GONNA SIGN IT.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.934
IF YOU WANT A PRENUP,
THEN I'M NOT GONNA GET MARRIED.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.202
- THAT'S A--I THINK
THAT'S THE WORST THING

10:36.236 --> 10:38.238
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.974
YOU DON'T WANNA
GET MARRIED NOW?

10:42.208 --> 10:44.444
- MY BUYER'S PREPARED
TO WALK AWAY RIGHT NOW.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.945
- YOUR BUYER
IS NOT EVEN HERE.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.347
- HE'S PREPARED
TO WALK AWAY.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.348
I'M PREPARED
TO WALK AWAY.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.716
- [groans]

10:57.357 --> 11:00.727
- I THINK THAT'S THE WORST THING
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.295
YOU DON'T WANNA
GET MARRIED NOW?

11:02.328 --> 11:03.329
- MAYBE I'M OVERREACTING.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.831
BUT WHAT I'D RATHER DO
IS, SAY,

11:04.864 --> 11:07.334
LET'S HAVE A CEREMONY
WHERE WE "GET MARRIED,"

11:07.367 --> 11:08.968
AND THEN WE DON'T SIGN
THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

11:09.069 --> 11:10.804
'CAUSE THEN, THAT WAY,
YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA TAKE HALF

11:10.837 --> 11:12.072
OF ANYTHING THAT YOU OWN.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.306
IF THAT'S HOW CYNICAL
WE'RE GONNA BE.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.809
- NO, THAT'S BULL[bleep],
BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY,

11:15.842 --> 11:19.079
AS TWO MEN, BEING ABLE,
AT LEAST IN THIS STATE,

11:19.112 --> 11:20.180
RECOGNIZED TO DO THAT,

11:20.213 --> 11:21.881
WE NEED
THAT FREAKIN' CONTRACT.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.085
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.287
- LOOK, I THINK
GETTING A PRENUP,

11:27.320 --> 11:29.756
IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY

11:29.789 --> 11:32.826
MY PARENTS NEVER DID
WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.294
I MEAN, LIKE, FOR YOU,
YOU COME STRAIGHT

11:34.327 --> 11:36.696
FROM THAT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
WHERE IT'S ALL CONTRACTS.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.098
EVERYONE'S SCREWING EVERYONE.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.332
EVERYONE'S FIGHTING,
YOU KNOW,

11:39.366 --> 11:40.700
DOING ALL THESE
TERRIBLE THINGS.

11:40.734 --> 11:45.238
BUT IT'S NOT--NOT THE WAY
I'M GONNA DO THINGS.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.477
[sighs]

11:50.510 --> 11:52.012
- ONE OF THE MANY REASONS
WHY I LOVE DEREK

11:52.112 --> 11:53.246
AND WHY WE FIT
SO WELL TOGETHER

11:53.279 --> 11:56.449
IS THAT HE IS SO FAR
FROM REAL ESTATE.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.884
MOST DAYS,
ALL I THINK ABOUT

11:57.917 --> 11:59.819
IS COMMISSIONS,
DEALS, CONTRACTS.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.355
AND THAT'S NOT HOW
I WANT TO APPROACH MY MARRIAGE.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.058
YOU KNOW,
YOU MEET SOMEBODY...

12:05.091 --> 12:06.393
AND YOU FALL
IN LOVE.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.596
AND YOU DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

12:09.629 --> 12:12.866
BUT MY LOVE FOR YOU
AND YOUR LOVE FOR ME

12:12.899 --> 12:15.201
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ANY STUPID PRENUP.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.337
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE TRUST,

12:17.370 --> 12:21.708
THEN NONE OF IT MATTERS.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.909
- I AGREE.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.110
- BUT THIS IS GOOD

12:24.144 --> 12:26.746
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GET
HALF OF YOURS TOO,

12:26.780 --> 12:28.648
HALF OF ALL THOSE
PAINTINGS.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.918
[both chuckle]

12:31.951 --> 12:36.790
- MORE.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.894
I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.299
[line trilling]

12:46.332 --> 12:48.268
-<i>HOLA.</i>
- UM, HEY.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.870
PEDRO, IT'S RYAN SERHANT
FROM NEST SEEKERS.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.541
BEACON COURT, YOU CAME
TO MY BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE,

12:54.574 --> 12:55.608
THE INTERNATIONAL ONE.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.244
DO YOU HAVE ANYONE?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.149
UH, UM--
OKAY, OKAY.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.251
I WAS ON--I-I-
I WILL SHOOT YOU AN EMAIL.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.252
I'LL SHOOT YOU
AN EMAIL.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.288
NOW THAT SERGEI
HAS TOTALLY SCREWED ME,

13:08.321 --> 13:11.891
ALL OF MY FOCUS, LITERALLY,
IS ON SELLING BEACON COURT.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.127
HEY.
UH,<i>HOLA,</i>MARCOS.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.128
THIS IS RYAN SERHANT
FROM NEST SEEKERS.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.196
HOW ARE YOU?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.630
BECAUSE IF I DON'T SELL
THIS APARTMENT,

13:17.664 --> 13:20.533
NOT ONLY WILL I BE SUBJECTED
TO MARK'S TORTURE,

13:20.567 --> 13:21.568
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

13:21.601 --> 13:23.803
I WILL LOSE THE RESPECT
OF HIS CLIENT,

13:23.837 --> 13:26.106
WHO'S A HUGE INTERNATIONAL
PROPERTY INVESTOR.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.674
- I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME.

13:27.707 --> 13:31.244
BUT YOU REMEMBER YOU CAME
TO MY INTERNATIONAL OPEN HOUSE,

13:31.277 --> 13:34.914
UH,<i>FESTIVIDAD,</i>UM...

13:41.121 --> 13:42.188

13:42.222 --> 13:45.225
- HAS ANYONE EVER
SCREWED YOU OVER BEFORE?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.093
- NO.

13:47.093 --> 13:50.363
- NO?

13:50.397 --> 13:51.998
I WORK
IN THE WRONG BUSINESS.

13:52.098 --> 13:55.235
[line trilling]
- [chuckles]

13:55.268 --> 13:56.870
- MICHELLE.
<i>HOLA.</i>

13:56.903 --> 13:58.238
UH,<i>ES RYAN.</i>

13:58.271 --> 14:00.674
- THIS IS MICHELLE.
SHE HAS A BUYER FROM VENEZUELA.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.675
- GOT IT.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.143
I REMEMBER YOU SAYING

14:03.176 --> 14:06.646
THAT YOU HAD A CLIENT
WHO WAS INTERESTED.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.315
HAVE YOU FOUND HIM
ANYTHING YET?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.459
MICHELLE IS A BROKER
WITH ELEGANT PROPERTY.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.195
SHE WORKS WITH A LOT
OF SPANISH-SPEAKING CLIENTS.

14:22.228 --> 14:26.433
AND WHOOP-DEE-[bleep]ING-DOO,
SHE'S GOT SOMEBODY.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.073
OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
I LOVE SKYPE.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.841
HE THINKS THE APARTMENT
IS TOO EXPENSIVE.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.076
DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT THE PRICE.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.210
WE'LL--WE'LL--
WE'LL NEGOTIATE.

14:37.243 --> 14:38.211

14:39.546 --> 14:43.083
I AM GOING TO DO

SO HELP ME GOD.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.920

ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.363

18:31.378 --> 18:33.713
- I KNOW, IT WAS VERY NICE
OF YOU AND VERY KIND.

18:33.747 --> 18:36.182
HOWEVER, WE DID SEE SO--
SOME OTHER PROPERTIES

18:36.216 --> 18:37.183
THAT WERE IN THE--
THE HIGH THREES.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.184
- KAREN.
- LET ME JUST FINISH.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.419
THE HIGH THREES.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.321
- I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ABOUT OTHER PROPERTIES

18:41.354 --> 18:42.689
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GIVE ME
ONE GOOD EXAMPLE.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.790
GIVE ME ONE ADDRESS.

18:43.823 --> 18:47.460
- THERE'S A LISTING
OFF OF HUDSON.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.630
- WHY DON'T YOU BUY
THAT ONE?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.065
- HE WANTS TO BE
MORE CENTRAL.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.967
HE REALLY LIKES--
HE DOES LIKE THE ICONIC VIEWS--

18:54.067 --> 18:55.869
- OH--OH, OH, OH,
HE WANTS TO BE AT MERCER

18:55.902 --> 18:57.070
BETWEEN PRINCE
AND SPRING.

18:57.070 --> 19:01.374
- RIGHT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE, THOUGH.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.575
- I THINK
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.245
I THINK HE SENT YOU HERE
TO DO A DEAL

19:05.278 --> 19:06.413
AND YOU'RE TRYING
FOR FOUR.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.480
- RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE AT FOUR.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.516
- OKAY, OFFER REJECTED.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.684
HOW'S THAT?
- FINE.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.686
- 'CAUSE I'M AUTHORIZED
BY MY CLIENT,

19:12.719 --> 19:14.788
THE DEVELOPER,
TO TAKE NOTHING BELOW ASK.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.256
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT ME
TO PERCENT

19:16.289 --> 19:17.390
ANYTHING LESS
THAN THAT.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.026
LIKE, YOU NEED
TO CONVINCE HIM

19:20.060 --> 19:21.661
THAT 4.4 IS ACTUALLY
A GOOD PRICE.

19:21.695 --> 19:22.929
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:23.029 --> 19:24.564
YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME
IN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,

19:24.597 --> 19:26.266
WHEN IT'S 6.4.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.702
- AND MY BUYER'S PREPARED
TO WALK AWAY RIGHT NOW.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.770
- YOUR BUYER
IS NOT EVEN HERE.

19:30.804 --> 19:32.205
- HE'S PREPARED
TO WALK AWAY.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.473
I'M PREPARED
TO WALK AWAY.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.642
- WHAT, YOU--
YOU'RE NOT WALKING AWAY.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.943
I JUST GOT YOU
LOBSTER AND CHAMPAGNE.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.812
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT WAS LOVELY.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.513
THIS IS THE OLDEST TRICK
IN THE BOOK.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.649
NO ONE EVER WALKS OUT.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.050
- HAVE A GREAT AFTERNOON.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.454
- IT'S A SILLY TRICK
THAT ONLY SILLY BROKERS USE.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.456
- I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA CELEBRATE.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.424
- LET ME KNOW.
THANKS.

19:51.458 --> 19:56.062
- SERIOUSLY?

19:56.096 --> 19:58.098
[groans]

19:59.599 --> 20:00.867

20:00.900 --> 20:02.802
OR WE CAN SEE
IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE.

20:02.836 --> 20:04.337
BUT IT IS MY JOB
TO TELL YOU

20:20.687 --> 20:22.522

THAT REPRESENTS A SELLER,

20:22.555 --> 20:24.224
THERE IS NO BETTER POSITION
TO BE IN

20:24.257 --> 20:25.458
THAN THE ONE THAT I AM IN
RIGHT NOW.

20:25.492 --> 20:28.628
YESTERDAY, AFTER RECEIVING
A FULL ASKING OFFER,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.730
I RECEIVED ANOTHER ONE

20:30.764 --> 20:33.867
SO I HAVE TWO OFFERS
AT FULL ASKING PRICE,

20:33.900 --> 20:35.468
AND IT FEELS AMAZING.

20:35.502 --> 20:36.936
NOW, I GET
TO PRESENT THEM TOMORROW,

20:36.970 --> 20:39.706
AND HOPEFULLY,
I CAN PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.474
- THE SEXIEST PUERTO RICAN
I EVER MET.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.443
MWAH. HOW ARE YOU?
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.378
- THANK YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.615
- I WANT TO SAY IT'S LIKEWISE,
BUT WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.816
- OH, COME ON.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.351
YOU CAN'T BE THAT NEGATIVE
ALL THE TIME.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.352
LET ME GET YOU
A DRINK.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.087
- SURE, I'LL HAVE ONE.
- OKAY.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.522
HOW ARE YOU, MAN?

20:55.555 --> 20:57.157
"SUCK MY COCKTAILS."
I LIKE THAT.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.491
- I'LL HAVE
A GIN AND TONIC.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.628
- I'LL HAVE A VODKA WITH
A SMALL SPLASH OF ORANGE JUICE.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.900
- SO WHY--WHY DID YOU DRAG ME
OVER HERE?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.569
- WELL, I ACTUALLY
COME WITH GREAT NEWS.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.838
- I HOPE SO.
- I AM SO GOOD.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.708
NOT ONLY DID I BROUGHT YOU
YOUR FULL ASKING OFFER,

21:14.741 --> 21:18.211
BUT I BROUGHT TWO

21:18.244 --> 21:20.914
BOOM.
- [laughs]

21:20.947 --> 21:23.850
- NOW, AM I A CHAMPION,
OR AM I A [bleep]ING CHAMPION?

21:23.883 --> 21:25.819
- YOU PULLED THROUGH.
I'M PROUD.

21:25.852 --> 21:26.986
- [sighs]
- SO CHEERS.

FULL ASKING OFFERS ON THE TABLE

21:34.361 --> 21:37.230
THAT YOU CAN SIGN RIGHT AWAY,
GET THINGS OVER WITH,

OR WE CAN TRY
TO ROLL THE DICE

21:39.099 --> 21:41.234
AND SEE IF WE
CAN GET SOME MORE.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.436
WHAT I SUGGEST
IS THAT WE TRY

21:43.470 --> 21:44.971
TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE
FROM THEM

21:45.005 --> 21:47.574
JUST BECAUSE BOTH QUALIFY.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.209
BUT IT IS MY JOB
TO TELL YOU

21:49.242 --> 21:51.478
THAT BY TRYING
TO GET SOME MORE,

21:51.511 --> 21:53.213
THIS IS A GAMBLE.

21:53.246 --> 21:55.281
BUYERS IN THIS MARKET
ARE EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.983
MOST OF THEM DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO A BIDDING WAR.

21:57.017 --> 21:58.585
SINCE THIS IS
YOUR APARTMENT,

21:58.618 --> 22:00.487
I WANNA LET YOU DECIDE
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.456
- MORE.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.292

22:06.326 --> 22:08.728
OKAY.
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.130
I'LL TRY
TO GET YOU MORE.

22:10.163 --> 22:13.566
- DON'T TRY.
JUST GET ME MORE.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.635
- OKAY.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.370
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK

AT FULL ASKING PRICE

22:22.876 --> 22:24.978
ON A VERY, EXTREMELY
UNIQUE PROPERTY.

22:25.078 --> 22:26.813
SO IF THEY REALLY,
REALLY WANT IT,

22:26.846 --> 22:29.315
THEY HAVE TO COME UP
IN PRICE.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.550
HELLO, NEIL.
THIS IS LUIS ORTIZ.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.951
HOW ARE YOU?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.288

22:35.321 --> 22:37.590
I KNOW YOU HAVE AN OFFER
AT FULL ASKING PRICE.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.259
BUT I ALSO HAVE
ANOTHER ONE,

22:39.292 --> 22:42.362
EQUALLY QUALIFIED,
ALSO AT FULL ASKING.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.364
SO IF YOUR BUYERS
WANT THIS APARTMENT,

22:44.397 --> 22:47.400
THEY GOTTA COME UP
AT LEAST 30 GRAND.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.507
I AM NOT TRYING
TO PULL ANYTHING.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.508
LISTEN, THIS IS THE WAY
REAL ESTATE WORKS,

22:55.542 --> 22:56.676
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

22:56.710 --> 22:59.112
BRING HIM UP 30 GRAND,
AND I WILL MAKE A DEAL.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.147
THAT'S A PROMISE.

23:04.351 --> 23:06.152
LISTEN, CALL YOUR BUYERS
AND CALL ME BACK.

23:06.186 --> 23:07.787
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED
TO YOUR BUYERS.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.823
I JUST
CAN'T ACCEPT--

23:13.059 --> 23:17.831
[dial tone]

23:17.864 --> 23:20.066
HELLO?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.617
- SELLING THE FIRST UNIT
AT MERCER

23:37.650 --> 23:39.486
HAS BEEN
A REAL BIG PROBLEM.

23:39.519 --> 23:43.189
KAREN CAN'T CONVINCE THEM
THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT PRICE,

23:43.223 --> 23:46.159
SO I GUESS
I HAVE TO DO IT FOR HER.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.461
- WHAT IS GOING ON?
[bicycle bell rings]

23:48.495 --> 23:49.996
- HOW DO I BRAKE--BRAKE?
OOH.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.699
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

23:52.732 --> 23:54.100
- I KNOW WE HAVEN'T AGREED...
- RIGHT.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.404
- ON PRICE, SO I THOUGHT
WE'D GO ON A TOUR.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.272
- AND I'M EXPECTED
TO CLIMB ON BOARD WITH YOU?

23:59.305 --> 24:00.674
WE'RE GONNA LOOK
AT SOME BUILDINGS.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.076
WATCH OUT.
EVERYBODY PEDAL.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.445
KAREN IS MOSTLY
AN UPTOWN BROKER.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.280
I'M NOT SO SURE
SHE'S THAT FAMILIAR

24:07.313 --> 24:08.815
WITH OLD SOHO BUILDINGS.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.618
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE TODAY
THAT SHE'S VERY FAMILIAR,

24:11.651 --> 24:14.821
EVEN IF IT MEANS DRAGGING HER
INTO EVERY BUILDING.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.356
[screams]
[bleep].

24:16.389 --> 24:20.794
- THIS IS
A VERY SHAKY BIKE.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.295
- OKAY, WE'RE
ON A HUNT HERE.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.064
CAST-IRON FACADE.
HISTORIC SOHO.

24:24.064 --> 24:25.098
AAH!

24:25.131 --> 24:27.500
THE CLIENTS ARE LOOKING
FOR A PIED-A-TERRE

24:27.534 --> 24:30.136
IN NEW YORK CITY,
SOHO AND HISTORIC.

24:30.170 --> 24:33.740
THIS BLOCK ON GREENE STREET
IS, LIKE,<i>THE</i>CAST-IRON BLOCK.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.410
LANDMARK-PROTECTED FOREVER.
TAKE A PICTURE.

24:37.444 --> 24:39.145
SEND IT TO L.A.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:39.179 --> 24:41.448
- BUT TO GET THEM UP
TO 4.4 FULL ASK,

24:41.481 --> 24:43.316
I NEED TO PROVE
THAT 111 MERCER

24:43.350 --> 24:44.584
IS RENOVATED
TO PERFECTION.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.720
HERE IT IS.
NOW, WE'RE JUST GONNA GO INSIDE.

24:46.753 --> 24:49.089
IT'S UNIQUE, AND THERE
ARE NO OTHER BUILDINGS

24:49.089 --> 24:50.557
IN SOHO
WITH THESE FINISHES.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.325
THE FACADES
ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL.

24:52.359 --> 24:54.627
BUT WHAT
YOU NEVER GET

24:54.661 --> 24:58.098
IS THE BEAUTIFUL INTERIORS
LIKE 111 MERCER.

24:58.098 --> 24:59.899
SO LET'S LOOK AT ONE
OF THESE OLDER BUILDINGS.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.701
- SHOW ME
WHAT YOU GOT.

25:01.735 --> 25:05.438
WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE?

25:05.472 --> 25:08.441
- SO, A TYPICAL LOFT.

25:08.475 --> 25:11.044
TYPICAL OLD SOHO LOFT.

25:11.044 --> 25:12.112
- LET'S LOOK AT THE BATHROOM.
- LET'S CONTINUE TO LOOK.

25:12.145 --> 25:14.247
- 'CAUSE YOU REMEMBER
THE $10,000 TUB,

25:14.280 --> 25:16.916
THE WATERWORKS,
BRICK, ROMAN MIRRORS?

25:16.950 --> 25:20.754
- OKAY.
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

25:20.787 --> 25:22.322
- KAREN NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
I COULD'VE GONE

25:22.355 --> 25:24.157
WITH THE LOWER PRICES
AND THE BAD FINISHES...

25:24.190 --> 25:25.392
LIKE THIS.

25:25.425 --> 25:27.560
BUT I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS
OF MEDIOCRITY.

25:27.594 --> 25:30.663
111 MERCER IS A BEAUTIFUL
CAST-IRON FACADE

25:30.697 --> 25:32.932
WITH VERY HIGH LEVEL
OF FINISHES.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.235
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,
AND I'M TOP-DOLLAR.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.504
THIS IS WHAT A SOHO LOFT
LOOKS LIKE.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.972
THIS IS THE INTERIOR
YOU GET.

25:39.072 --> 25:40.407
- IT'S NOT LUXURY.
- TAKE A PICTURE.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.708
SEND IT TO L.A.
- ALL RIGHT.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.710
- I'M REALLY HOPING
THIS IS THE TIPPING POINT

25:43.743 --> 25:46.413
THAT GETS THEM FROM 4 MILLION
TO 4.4 MILLION.

25:46.446 --> 25:49.549
4.4 SYMBOLIZES
PERFECTION, RIGHT?

25:49.582 --> 25:52.719
IF NOT...
I'M BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.588
OH, MAYBE I'LL USE THESE
FOR MY NEXT PROJECT.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.323
NOT.

26:02.529 --> 26:05.031
[line trilling]

26:05.031 --> 26:06.032
- [sighs]

26:06.032 --> 26:07.567
SOMETIMES, CREATING
A BIDDING WAR

26:07.600 --> 26:09.269
IS A STRAIGHT-UP GAMBLE.

26:09.302 --> 26:10.704
AND RIGHT NOW,
I'VE ALREADY ALMOST

26:10.737 --> 26:12.405
LOST ONE BUYER
BECAUSE OF THAT.

26:12.439 --> 26:15.041
SO THIS MAY BE MY ONLY CHANCE
TO SELL THIS PLACE.

26:15.075 --> 26:18.611
[line trilling]

26:18.645 --> 26:19.879

HAS BEEN FORWARDED

26:19.913 --> 26:22.382

26:31.191 --> 26:33.093
I AM SITTING WITH THE SELLER
RIGHT NOW,

26:33.126 --> 26:36.830
AND WE JUST GOT
ANOTHER OFFER,

26:36.863 --> 26:39.199
AND WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO
IN ORDER TO CLOSE THIS DEAL

26:39.232 --> 26:41.568
IS FOR YOU TO COME UP.

SO CALL ME, TEXT ME,

CAN GET A DEAL DONE.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.309
THANK YOU, ANDREW.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.244
AT THIS POINT,
I'M JUST HOPING THAT THIS GUY

26:51.277 --> 26:52.812
CAN COME BACK TO ME
WITH SOMETHING GOOD

26:52.846 --> 26:57.350
BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY PUSH
ANYBODY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT...

26:57.384 --> 26:58.818
- SO HOW DID IT GO?

26:58.852 --> 27:01.021
- AND I THINK THIS TIME,
I PUSHED THIS BUYER

27:01.054 --> 27:02.689
TO A PLACE
THEY DIDN'T WANNA BE PUSHED.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.290
I REACHED OUT
TO THE FIRST BROKER,

27:04.324 --> 27:06.893
AND, UM,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA COME UP.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.428
THEIR OFFER
WAS THEIR BEST AND FINAL,

27:08.461 --> 27:10.530
AND THAT IS
PRETTY MUCH IT.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.265
AND I REACHED OUT
TO THE OTHER BROKER,

27:12.298 --> 27:13.700
AND I HAVEN'T
HEARD ANYTHING BACK YET,

27:13.733 --> 27:14.768
BUT THERE IS
STILL A CHANCE

27:14.801 --> 27:16.202
THAT THEY CAN COME UP
A LITTLE BIT.

27:16.236 --> 27:18.204
SO NOW,
WE JUST WAIT AND SEE.

27:18.238 --> 27:19.572
IN THE MEANTIME,
WHILE WE WAIT,

27:19.606 --> 27:20.874
LET'S GET
ANOTHER DRINK, PLEASE,

27:20.907 --> 27:21.941
'CAUSE IT FEELS LIKE
YOU NEED ONE

27:22.042 --> 27:24.044
AND I DEFINITELY
NEED ONE MYSELF.

27:24.044 --> 27:25.412
HERE YOU GO.

27:25.445 --> 27:27.313
FOR PASSION.

27:27.347 --> 27:29.182

27:45.298 --> 27:49.302
[cell phone chimes]
- HOLD ON, I JUST GOT AN EMAIL.

27:52.339 --> 27:55.542
FROM THE BROKER.

27:55.575 --> 27:57.677
HE SAYS, "DEAR LUIS,
WE HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED

28:06.086 --> 28:07.654
THAT IS AMAZING.
WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.123
OKAY, 1,325.
- LET'S DO IT. LET'S DO IT.

28:10.156 --> 28:13.660
IN THE END, I WAS ABLE
TO GET ONLY $25,000

LESS THAN MY ORIGINAL

28:15.428 --> 28:17.630

HOW IT'S DONE, FOLKS.

ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT A DEAL.

MICHELLE'S POTENTIAL BUYER

28:45.125 --> 28:46.826
IS A BUSINESSMAN
FROM VENEZUELA.

28:46.860 --> 28:51.064
ALL RIGHT, SO VENEZUELA
IS IN SOUTH AMERICA.

28:51.097 --> 28:54.167
SOUTH AMERICA, NOT EUROPE.
GOOD TO KNOW.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.635
SO I'M GONNA GET HER
IN THERE.

28:55.669 --> 28:57.404
AND WE'RE GONNA SKYPE
WITH THIS GUY.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.908
THAT'S GOOD
TO KNOW.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.109
- AND BECAUSE SHE'S SPANISH,

29:03.143 --> 29:06.513
I'M GONNA THROW IN
A LITTLE SPANISH FLARE.

29:06.546 --> 29:09.549
GOOD.

OH.

- INTERESTING LOOK.

29:19.559 --> 29:20.593
- DO I LOOK VENEZUELAN
TO YOU?

29:20.627 --> 29:21.795
- NOT REALLY, NO.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.863
- WELL, ANYWAY,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

HAS 2,800 KILOMETERS OF--
OF COASTLINE?

29:51.858 --> 29:52.859
- HE SAYS
"REALLY GOOD,"

29:52.892 --> 29:54.094
BUT HE WANTS TO SEE
THE APARTMENT.

29:54.127 --> 29:55.362
HE DOESN'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THAT.

29:55.395 --> 29:57.397
OKAY.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.368
HE WANTS TO SEE THE VIEW.
- THE VIEW?

30:01.401 --> 30:02.869
- ALL RIGHT.
[clears throat]

30:02.902 --> 30:04.070

[laughs]

30:06.606 --> 30:07.574
WHICH WAY
DOES THIS FACE?

30:07.607 --> 30:08.975
- THIS IS EAST

30:09.009 --> 30:11.411
THIS IS EAST,
"LA EAST-A."

30:11.444 --> 30:14.447
CAN YOU ASK HIM IF--IF THIS
IS BETTER THAN VENEZUELA?

30:20.020 --> 30:21.187
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

30:21.221 --> 30:23.623
- HE SAYS TO TAKE OFF
YOUR RED HANDKERCHIEF,

30:23.656 --> 30:24.824
THAT IT LOOKS
REALLY UGLY.

30:24.858 --> 30:27.594
[laughs]
OKAY, UM...

30:27.627 --> 30:29.062
- IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT MICHELLE'S CLIENT

30:29.095 --> 30:30.463
HASN'T REALLY TAKEN TO ME

30:30.497 --> 30:34.167
AS WELL AS ALMOST
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES.

30:37.037 --> 30:39.305
SO I'M JUST GONNA KINDA
STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT

30:39.339 --> 30:43.009
AND LET HER
DO HER THING.

30:48.815 --> 30:50.050
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.384
- LET'S JUST PUT IT
OVER HERE

30:51.418 --> 30:53.086
'CAUSE I THINK HE'S
GETTING A LITTLE UPSET

30:53.119 --> 30:55.188
EVERY TIME HE SEES YOU
WITH YOUR RED SCARF.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.390
- THIS IS ONE MOMENT

30:57.424 --> 30:58.692
I WISH
I HAD PAID ATTENTION

30:58.725 --> 31:02.762
IN THOSE SEVEN YEARS
OF SPANISH CLASSES.

I HOPE MY DAD
NEVER KNOWS THIS.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.534
OH, WAIT.

31:14.574 --> 31:17.577
- OKAY.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.816

31:22.849 --> 31:24.384
- YOU HANG UP
THE PHONE?

31:24.417 --> 31:25.585
- YES.
- SO WHAT'D HE SAY?

31:25.618 --> 31:29.556
- HE'S WILLING TO OFFER
6.9 MILLION, CASH.

31:29.589 --> 31:33.660
- AND THAT'S IT?
- THAT'S HIS FINAL OFFER.

31:33.693 --> 31:34.728
[sighs]

31:34.761 --> 31:36.830
THE FIRST OFFER
WAS 7 MILLION,

31:36.863 --> 31:40.834
BUT SERGEI HAD THE AUDACITY
TO PULL OUT

31:40.867 --> 31:43.136
BECAUSE HE GOT A BETTER DEAL
ON THE SAME APARTMENT

31:43.169 --> 31:44.671
TWO FLOORS UP.

31:44.704 --> 31:47.007
IT'S, LIKE,
$600,000 BELOW.

31:47.107 --> 31:49.542
- HE'S NOT WILLING
TO NEGOTIATE ON THAT.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.844
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOW VERY EVIDENT

31:50.877 --> 31:52.912
THAT MARK'S CLIENT
IS ASKING TOO MUCH.

31:52.946 --> 31:54.147
THAT'S A FACT.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.815
AND IF I CAN'T CONVINCE HIM
TO TAKE THIS,

31:55.849 --> 31:57.517
THEN THE WHOLE DEAL
IS GONNA FALL APART.

31:57.550 --> 31:58.518
LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

31:58.551 --> 31:59.819
- ALL RIGHT.
LET ME KNOW.

- OKAY.
- I'LL WAIT HERE.

32:02.222 --> 32:03.923

32:22.175 --> 32:23.910
I AM NOT LOSING
ANOTHER ONE.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.745
IF MARK WANTS TO SELL
THIS THING

32:25.779 --> 32:27.414
AND GET US BOTH
OUT OF HOT WATER,

32:27.447 --> 32:29.082
I HAVE TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HIM

32:29.082 --> 32:30.750
AND GET HIM DOWN
ON PRICE

32:30.784 --> 32:33.453
SO THAT WE CAN SELL
THIS THING TODAY.

32:33.486 --> 32:35.488

AFTER 2 1/2 YEARS,

37:02.255 --> 37:05.091
I GOT VERY EMOTIONAL BECAUSE
SEEING MY PARENTS SMILING

37:05.125 --> 37:06.559
REMINDS ME
THAT ALL MY HARD WORK

37:06.593 --> 37:08.895
IS SO WORTH IT,

37:08.928 --> 37:11.731
AND I WANT
TO MAKE THEM PROUD.

37:11.765 --> 37:13.266
OKAY, SO I'LL SAY
SOME WORDS.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.267
YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:14.300 --> 37:16.302
UH, WE HAVE A--
A BIG FAMILY.

37:16.336 --> 37:18.071
WE HAVE, LIKE,
78 PEOPLE.

37:18.104 --> 37:21.041
BUT IN THE END,
THIS IS THE REAL FAMILY.

37:21.041 --> 37:22.142
- YES.

37:22.175 --> 37:25.745

I'M SPEECHLESS

37:54.674 --> 37:57.177
both: THE BEACHES.
[chuckling]

37:57.210 --> 37:58.378

- AWESOME.

38:36.449 --> 38:37.684
- I'M NOT GONNA GIVE IT
TO YOU, THOUGH.

38:37.717 --> 38:39.152
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I WANT YOU TO DO.

38:39.185 --> 38:41.054
JUST COME OUTSIDE.

38:45.959 --> 38:46.926

38:46.960 --> 38:48.962

38:50.130 --> 38:51.731
JUST SIT. JUST SIT.
OKAY, OKAY.

38:51.765 --> 38:54.501

38:55.635 --> 38:56.936
YOU KNOW,
SHE NEEDS ATTENTION,

38:56.970 --> 38:58.605
IT'S JUST TOUGH
'CAUSE I'M JUST NEVER HOME.

38:58.638 --> 39:00.106
AND SO WHEN I LEAVE HER
AT HOME,

39:00.140 --> 39:01.408
I THINK SHE MISSES ME.

39:01.441 --> 39:05.578
- MY WIFE'S ALWAYS WANTED
ONE OF THOSE.

39:05.612 --> 39:08.682
ALWAYS WANTED
A LITTLE PIG.

39:08.715 --> 39:10.116
- YOUR WIFE HAS ALWAYS
WANTED A PIG?

39:10.150 --> 39:11.584
- YEAH.
IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

39:11.618 --> 39:13.787
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PETS.
THAT'D BE A NICE ONE TO HAVE.

39:13.820 --> 39:15.755
I'LL TAKE HER ANY TIME
YOU DON'T WANT HER.

39:15.789 --> 39:17.290

SHE WOULD LOVE IT
BACK THERE.

39:58.131 --> 40:00.467
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A WEEK
SINCE I FOUND A NEW BUYER

40:00.500 --> 40:02.769
FOR ONE BEACON COURT,
AND MARK STILL

40:02.802 --> 40:04.004
HASN'T SIGNED
THE AGREEMENT,

40:04.037 --> 40:06.973
SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

40:07.007 --> 40:10.977
[line trilling]

40:13.680 --> 40:15.115
- YOUR CALL
HAS BEEN FORWARDED

DOING A LITTLE SHOPPING.

40:22.088 --> 40:26.192
I WANTED TO HAND-DELIVER
THE SIGNED AGREEMENT.

40:26.226 --> 40:27.994
- AWESOME.

40:28.028 --> 40:29.796
- BUT I'M NOT GONNA GIVE IT
TO YOU, THOUGH.

40:29.829 --> 40:31.131
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I WANT YOU TO DO.

40:31.164 --> 40:33.500
JUST COME OUTSIDE.
- WHAT?

40:33.533 --> 40:34.601
[groans]

40:34.634 --> 40:36.036
HAVEN'T I BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY?

40:36.069 --> 40:38.505
WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY
WANT FROM ME THIS TIME?

40:38.538 --> 40:39.939
- COME OUTSIDE.

40:39.973 --> 40:41.841
I'LL PLACE THIS HERE
SO YOU CAN--YOU CAN SEE IT.

40:41.875 --> 40:43.643
BUT YOU CAN'T
TOUCH IT YET.

40:43.677 --> 40:45.145
I MEAN, YOU--YOU THREW
A LITTLE LOOPHOLE

40:45.178 --> 40:46.846
EARLIER IN THE PROCESS

40:46.880 --> 40:48.381
WHEN YOU--YOU TOLD ME
YOU SOLD IT,

40:48.415 --> 40:50.283
THEN, YOU DIDN'T--YOU KNOW,
THEN IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH.

40:50.316 --> 40:51.451
- RIGHT.

40:51.484 --> 40:53.486
- SO, UH, LET'S DO
SOME MORE WALL SITS.

40:53.520 --> 40:54.888
- I DON'T WANNA DO
WALL SITS, MAN.

40:54.921 --> 40:56.489
- YOU KNOW,
DO YOU WANT THIS OR NOT?

40:56.523 --> 40:58.591
I MEAN, YOU PUT ME
THROUGH A LOT,

40:58.625 --> 40:59.826
MORE THAN I EXPECTED.

40:59.859 --> 41:01.327
SO GET BACK
IN YOUR WALL SIT POSITION

41:01.361 --> 41:02.362
AND JUST HOLD
A LITTLE FLOUR.

41:02.395 --> 41:03.797

YOU'RE GONNA HOLD THIS.

41:13.673 --> 41:14.674

I THINK FLOUR'S FALLING OUT.

41:14.708 --> 41:15.942

41:15.975 --> 41:17.977

THE [bleep]ING PLAN.

41:36.262 --> 41:38.298
NOW YOU GOT IT ON ME.

41:47.874 --> 41:49.576
I'M GONNA SEND THIS
TO THE LAWYERS.

41:49.609 --> 41:53.113
THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE
FOR EVERYTHING,

41:53.113 --> 41:55.915
AND IT'S CALLED COLLEGE,

41:55.949 --> 41:58.184
NOT MY OFFICE.

41:58.218 --> 42:02.322
100%, MARK,
YOU AND I ARE EVEN NOW.

FOR BEACON COURT.

42:04.791 --> 42:06.493
PLEASE DO NOT
LOSE IT.

42:06.526 --> 42:07.527
I WORKED VERY HARD
FOR IT.

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

42:10.597 --> 42:13.066
- JUST A L--JUST A LITTLE
ACCIDENT ON THE SIDEWALK.

42:13.099 --> 42:16.736
- JUST A LITTLE ACCIDENT?
- YUP.

42:16.770 --> 42:18.371
- DO YOU NEED
A SWIFFER?

42:18.405 --> 42:20.140
- NO, NO. I'M GOOD.
- ARE YOU SURE?

42:20.173 --> 42:22.542

LOOKING AT AN APARTMENT HAS
TO BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE.

42:32.819 --> 42:34.688
SO I'M MAKING A MOVIE
TO SEE AN APARTMENT

42:34.721 --> 42:35.755
IN A MUCH DIFFERENT WAY.

42:35.789 --> 42:36.890
NO!

42:36.923 --> 42:38.858
I RAN OUT OF MEMORY.

42:38.892 --> 42:39.893

- I AM PROBABLY
THE LEAST LIKELY PERSON

42:53.306 --> 42:54.908
FREDRIK WOULD WANT
