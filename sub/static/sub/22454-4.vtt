'Don't screw this up.
No screw-ups. Got to impress! '

00:31.307 --> 00:36.097
So Mr Corrigan, we've examined your
loan application and I have one question.

00:37.147 --> 00:40.025
Are you a pathetic, worthless punk?

00:40.067 --> 00:41.705
Er, well, no.

00:41.747 --> 00:46.537
Right. Because I'm going to turn you
down as if you were a hippy parasite.

00:46.587 --> 00:49.579
'Oh, yes. Yeah, I like it. '

00:49.627 --> 00:52.016
Then I'll make you feel like
a turkey fucker.

00:52.067 --> 00:56.822
Why? Because I'm the big man
and you're a shit heel, right?

00:56.867 --> 01:00.098
'Brilliant. That is just so spot on. '

01:00.147 --> 01:05.346
Or... I could treat Mr Corrigan
like a valued and respected customer

01:05.387 --> 01:07.378
and we'd both end up winners.

01:07.427 --> 01:11.420
- Isn't that right, Mr Corrigan?
- Right. Absolutely!

01:11.467 --> 01:14.982
- Dead right.
- 'Alan Johnson, I'm in love.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.583
'I'm in love with you, Johnson. '

01:18.627 --> 01:21.266
'There are two basic energies
in the world.

01:21.307 --> 01:23.457
'Stress and relaxation. '

01:23.507 --> 01:25.498
Super Hans...

01:26.627 --> 01:28.618
- What are we doing?
- We...

01:28.667 --> 01:32.182
are looking through
the other end of the telescope.

01:33.307 --> 01:35.377
I don't feel very well.

01:35.427 --> 01:38.624
- Did something bad happen?
- Everything's OK.

01:38.667 --> 01:42.501
There's two basic energies in the world -
stress and relaxation.

01:42.547 --> 01:46.540
- Did I break through?
- You passed out after the love beans.

01:46.587 --> 01:49.101
I thought the table was being ironic.

01:50.147 --> 01:52.581
But what was the bad thing?

01:53.627 --> 01:55.618
'Floss is boss. Floss is boss. '

01:55.667 --> 01:59.137
- Floss is boss!
- 'No, not that.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.905
'Something worse. '

02:00.947 --> 02:04.906
- What happened?
- That will probably become clear later.

02:04.947 --> 02:07.222
Like the French Revolution.

02:07.267 --> 02:10.225
- I think we need to tidy up.
- Absolutely not.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.782
That is the one thing I stand against.
A thousand times, no.

02:16.347 --> 02:18.736
Hi! Come in, come in.

02:18.787 --> 02:20.618
- Hi, guys.
- Hiya, Soph.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.976
- How's it going?
- Oh, good, thanks.

02:23.027 --> 02:25.177
'Ask her to go to the bar. Ask her! '

02:25.227 --> 02:28.742
We're just watching a bit of Morse.
Care to join us?

02:28.787 --> 02:30.982
I don't think right now. Er, Mark...

02:31.987 --> 02:34.660
- I just wanted to say about the lift.
- 8:15 sharp?

02:34.707 --> 02:37.619
Yeah. I forgot about Debbie's wheelchair.

02:37.667 --> 02:40.500
- Yeah?
- I think it'll take quite a bit of room.

02:40.547 --> 02:44.779
- Right, well, that...
- Dave's helping her so I said to him...

02:44.827 --> 02:46.943
I mean, I could... help.

02:46.987 --> 02:51.663
Yeah... Yeah, sure.
It's just Dave's been, you know...

02:51.707 --> 02:54.460
Oh, yeah. Totally. Absolutely.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.419
'Dave's the saint.
Nothing must unseat Dave. '

02:57.467 --> 03:01.983
I'm really sorry. I'm sure you'll be able
to get another lift or a train.

03:02.027 --> 03:04.416
- Honestly, it's fine.
- Sorry.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.822
Thanks. Well, see ya.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.061
Bye.

03:08.107 --> 03:10.496
- Night.
- OK, night.

03:15.227 --> 03:17.297
'Yes, I know what you're thinking.

03:17.347 --> 03:20.896
'I'm shit, you're great.
I'm the worm, you're the king.

03:20.947 --> 03:22.983
'Eat your nuts and go fuck yourself. '

03:27.107 --> 03:32.306
'Oh, I feel like loam, a piece
of loam. Jesus, what am I talking about?

03:32.347 --> 03:36.977
'I wish Mark was here. No more drugs.
I don't need drugs.

03:37.027 --> 03:40.303
'I mean, what great music
was ever made on drugs?

03:40.347 --> 03:45.546
'Bowie, obviously. The Floyd, the
Prodge, Aphex - the list is endless really.

03:45.587 --> 03:50.536
'But they could have done it twice as fast
with half the mess if they just...

03:50.587 --> 03:53.624
'Ah, was that the bad thing?

03:59.067 --> 04:01.137
'Not that. Something wronger.

04:01.187 --> 04:04.862
'Mark'll be so pleased when he sees this.
He's just so...

04:04.907 --> 04:07.627
'Maybe I could open
my bank statements.

04:07.662 --> 04:10.266
'Maybe you can be boring and cool. '

04:10.307 --> 04:13.663
'I only asked about the bus.
I'm not a freak.

04:13.707 --> 04:18.541
'Checking into the hotel, it's all,
"And can we get you fresh whatever?"

04:18.587 --> 04:23.297
'Once you're leaving, it's, "Well, one of
you is liable for the cashews. " Sophie...

04:24.387 --> 04:25.376
'Jeff?!

04:25.427 --> 04:28.225
'That fucking... Oh!

04:28.267 --> 04:30.064
'What's the story there?!

04:30.107 --> 04:34.817
'This is the worst thing to happen
to anyone ever. Oh, my fucking life.

04:34.867 --> 04:38.382
- 'It's Alan Johnson. '
- Mark! It is Mark, isn't it?

04:38.427 --> 04:41.305
- Yes, it is. It's Mark.
- So?

04:41.347 --> 04:44.066
- Do you want a lift or what?
- I would love a lift.

04:44.107 --> 04:48.066
'Shit! This is the best thing
to happen to anyone ever. '

04:48.107 --> 04:51.702
?... moonlight
Dancing in the moon...?

04:52.587 --> 04:55.545
'Look at me.
Friends with a big black businessman

04:55.587 --> 04:58.624
'like it's the most natural thing
in the world.

04:58.667 --> 05:04.537
'Lf he got accused of a crime he hadn't
committed, I could come to his aid and... '

05:04.587 --> 05:07.101
- Jez?
- Hey, you're back! This is great.

05:07.147 --> 05:08.944
- You're really back.
- Er, yes.

05:08.987 --> 05:13.424
The El Dude Brothers are back in town.
Aaaggh! Aaaggh!

05:13.467 --> 05:15.458
Uhhhh. Uhhhh.

05:15.507 --> 05:20.535
Come on in. Sit down. Tell me all about
your trip. I want to hear everything -

05:20.587 --> 05:22.942
all the gory details.

05:22.987 --> 05:26.104
Did you bring back any little tiny soaps?

05:26.147 --> 05:29.423
- Jez, are you all right?
- Course I am. Now you're back.

05:29.467 --> 05:34.336
Right. That's very nice and everything,
Jez, but I should open some wine.

05:34.387 --> 05:38.175
- Rather a good friend is coming over.
- Wine?

05:38.227 --> 05:39.945
Friend?

05:39.987 --> 05:43.297
But you haven't got a friend.
Who's your friend?

05:43.347 --> 05:45.577
Phoney Tony, I call him.

05:45.627 --> 05:48.425
This government is all spin,
it's smoke and mirrors.

05:48.467 --> 05:51.027
I totally agree. I couldn't agree more.

05:51.067 --> 05:54.662
- The way he licks Bush's arse.
- Pathetic!

05:54.707 --> 05:58.416
They're spending more on schools
but where's the evidence?

05:58.467 --> 06:03.222
What schools? Where? Where the heck
are they? Can you see them?

06:03.267 --> 06:08.136
'This is good. Yeah, three guys
sitting around, shooting the shit.

06:08.187 --> 06:13.136
'Politics doesn't have to be boring.
A lot of Moby's stuff is political, I think. '

06:13.187 --> 06:16.577
Yeah, it's all lies, isn't it?

06:16.627 --> 06:21.747
Don't tell me that Blair wears a suit
when he's at home watching Big Brother.

06:21.787 --> 06:25.860
- 'God. Not in front of Johnson. '
- How do you mean exactly?

06:25.907 --> 06:27.898
They should be more honest.

06:27.947 --> 06:30.381
At least, Tony Adams from the IRA,

06:30.427 --> 06:34.022
he's like, "Yeah, I shoot people.
I like shooting people. "

06:34.067 --> 06:35.898
If they were more honest,

06:35.947 --> 06:40.179
maybe people wouldn't switch
straight over when the news comes on.

06:40.227 --> 06:42.263
You turn over when the news comes on?

06:42.307 --> 06:44.741
No, no. No, sometimes...

06:45.667 --> 06:48.261
maybe for a treat, but generally, it's
great.

06:48.307 --> 06:52.459
Who do you support?
I mean, Mark likes Israel, I'm Palestine.

06:52.507 --> 06:55.738
Makes it more interesting
when you pick a...

06:55.787 --> 06:57.505
No?

06:57.547 --> 07:00.983
So I'll show you
what I've done so far on the book.

07:01.027 --> 07:04.497
- The book?
- Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs.

07:04.547 --> 07:07.823
It's only chapter one,
but it gives a flavour...

07:07.867 --> 07:10.142
'Oh, my God. The bad thing.

07:10.187 --> 07:12.178
'That's the bad thing! '

07:13.307 --> 07:15.025
Make a tsunami!

07:16.107 --> 07:17.825
Can I have a look?

07:18.867 --> 07:20.585
It doesn't seem to...

07:20.627 --> 07:22.538
Oh! Oh, dear.

07:22.587 --> 07:25.226
Look what you've... Oh, is it all right?

07:25.267 --> 07:29.146
- Well, no, but it wasn't working when...
- Oh, yes, it was.

07:29.187 --> 07:34.705
It was working fine and then you spilt
your drink on it. That's what happened.

07:34.747 --> 07:37.466
That's what I saw.

07:37.507 --> 07:41.102
'Me and Johnson.
We only met a fortnight ago.

07:41.147 --> 07:45.857
'Everything's happening so fast. '
That sounds... That sounds just...

07:45.907 --> 07:48.944
- amazing.
- Excellent. Second.

07:51.027 --> 07:54.815
Yeah, but the relocation thing,
moving out on Jeremy,

07:54.867 --> 07:57.939
- it feels a bit weird, Dad.
- 'Shit! '

07:57.987 --> 08:00.660
- Sorry?
- It feels weird, daddio.

08:00.707 --> 08:03.175
- 'Good save. '
- Why, daddio? Third.

08:03.227 --> 08:09.018
Well, nowadays, email and so forth,
do I really need to move to Cardiff?

08:09.067 --> 08:12.980
Let me tell you a story.
It's about two mountain climbers.

08:13.027 --> 08:19.626
One's climbing. The other one is injured,
weak, clinging to the first guy's leg.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.818
- Uh-huh. Interesting.
- The first guy has a choice.

08:22.867 --> 08:26.303
Let his pal cling on
and they're both yak food or...

08:26.347 --> 08:29.066
shake him off and make it to the top -

08:29.107 --> 08:30.859
solo.

08:31.907 --> 08:35.582
'I've got to tell him.
How am I going to tell him?

08:35.626 --> 08:38.346
'Oh, this is horrible. He might crumble.

08:38.386 --> 08:40.981
'He's weak. Remember the Johnson. '

08:41.027 --> 08:43.177
- Hey, Jez!
- Hey.

08:43.227 --> 08:47.220
So, what do you make of this place?
You choose what you want.

08:47.267 --> 08:52.546
'This could be good. Just like
the old days. Don't slag off Johnson yet. '

08:52.587 --> 08:56.660
Johnson told me about it. According to
Johnson, wasabi sauce is...

08:56.707 --> 08:58.857
Oh, Johnson says, Johnson says!

08:58.907 --> 09:02.456
If you love Johnson that much,
why don't you marry him?

09:02.507 --> 09:05.067
Where did this come from
all of a sudden?

09:05.107 --> 09:09.225
Why don't you actually screw him,
since you clearly want to so much?

09:09.267 --> 09:11.178
Jeremy!

09:11.227 --> 09:15.743
I've got nothing against being gay
but I'm not and neither is Johnson.

09:15.787 --> 09:18.585
He's black,
which I expect you've noticed.

09:18.627 --> 09:21.744
So just because he's black,
I have to like him.

09:21.787 --> 09:26.656
Do I? That's political correctness
gone mad. Look, Mark, I'm sorry...

09:26.707 --> 09:32.145
'Jesus, I'm just the sort of person
who'd be gay and repressive to himself. '

09:32.187 --> 09:34.382
The thing is, well...

09:35.427 --> 09:40.785
There's no easy way to put this
but... Johnson's invited me in with him.

09:40.827 --> 09:43.705
He wants me to get into bed,
team up with him.

09:43.747 --> 09:47.786
- It would mean relocating to Cardiff.
- You're kidding?

09:47.827 --> 09:51.786
Look, I really feel
I need to go for this, Jez.

09:51.827 --> 09:54.295
Look, it's not as if it's the end... for us.

09:54.347 --> 09:58.738
We're still the El Dude Brothers.
We always will be. It's just...

09:58.787 --> 10:00.937
I'm leaving.

10:00.987 --> 10:03.865
I can't spend my life with you
at base camp.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.898
OK, OK...

10:05.947 --> 10:08.302
That's fine. I'm fine with that.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.656
Good.

10:11.707 --> 10:15.256
'If I keep smiling,
maybe he won't leave. '

10:17.387 --> 10:19.264
This is a pretty cool place, isn't it?

10:19.307 --> 10:21.298
Chopsticks.

10:22.347 --> 10:25.066
Hmm, these are a bit long for me
actually.

10:26.347 --> 10:29.464
'He's cracked.
I hope he doesn't do anything drastic. '

10:29.507 --> 10:33.580
That's better.
So tell me all about the wasabi sauce.

10:33.627 --> 10:35.663
'If he hangs himself,

10:35.707 --> 10:39.905
'I could put an orange in his mouth
and say it was a fatal wanking accident. '

10:41.347 --> 10:44.464
I'm so glad
you came here for a follow-up, man.

10:44.507 --> 10:49.183
You totally blew apart Barbara's
whole stone-age business paradigm.

10:49.227 --> 10:51.218
Like taking candy from a baby.

10:51.267 --> 10:54.384
'Maybe I do fancy him.
He's handsome.

10:54.427 --> 11:00.423
'Not in a gay way. It's just obvious.
He's a good-looking guy - a guy's guy.

11:00.467 --> 11:02.537
- 'But would I...? '
- Hey, Mark.

11:02.587 --> 11:04.145
Sophie!

11:04.187 --> 11:07.259
Sophie, Sophie, Sophie!
You know Alan, of course.

11:07.307 --> 11:10.583
Yeah, quite a seminar.
Barbara went home crying.

11:10.627 --> 11:13.539
I'm just a doctor.
I didn't make the needles sharp.

11:13.587 --> 11:16.101
It's not a wig, Alan.
That's actually her hair.

11:16.147 --> 11:19.617
You've got to admit,
she was asking a lot of questions.

11:19.667 --> 11:23.740
- Thought you big kahunas should know.
- Yeah, whatever.

11:23.787 --> 11:26.176
See you.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.661
Jesus, some people!

11:28.707 --> 11:32.985
You point them to a lift
and they're like, "No, I'll take the stairs. "

11:33.027 --> 11:37.179
'I do want to be with him
but could I think about kissing?

11:37.227 --> 11:39.138
'Well, I'm thinking about it.

11:39.187 --> 11:42.259
'No, I'm just thinking
about thinking about it. '

11:42.307 --> 11:44.696
Yeah, she's very...

11:44.747 --> 11:49.741
Yeah... I could have a little thing
going there with Sophie actually.

11:49.787 --> 11:52.859
- Well, my advice is keep it little.
- Yeah?

11:52.907 --> 11:57.617
Women? Does a balance sheet ever cry
and say it needs time to think?

11:57.667 --> 12:01.899
Business doesn't say it loves you
then runs off with a buddy.

12:01.947 --> 12:05.462
Take a look at her, mate.
Take a good, hard look at her.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.067
What do you see?
What do you see in her,

12:08.107 --> 12:11.861
compared to, say,
a supermodel like Giselle?

12:11.907 --> 12:13.898
She's...

12:13.947 --> 12:16.256
I think she's... very pretty.

12:16.307 --> 12:18.377
Come on, look at her arse.

12:19.347 --> 12:24.102
Is that the best arse you're ever
going to get? Do you stick on that arse?

12:24.147 --> 12:27.105
She's got a fat arse.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.297
- Say it.
- Well, she's...

12:29.347 --> 12:31.497
Maybe it is a bit...

12:31.547 --> 12:33.538
nice, but in a sense...

12:33.587 --> 12:36.465
If we're gonna do this,
it's just you and me.

12:36.507 --> 12:39.544
No stress-buster mini-breaks, no women.

12:39.587 --> 12:43.466
Just us, a pile of Chinese food
and some fuck-off spreadsheets.

12:43.507 --> 12:46.704
'Oh, yes, take me, Johnson.
I'm yours! '

12:50.187 --> 12:52.655
Yeah, Jeremy and Super Hans.

12:52.707 --> 12:55.665
This is perfect
because I'm being evicted soon.

12:55.707 --> 12:59.302
We are gonna have parties in this place
that go beyond fun

12:59.347 --> 13:01.986
and actually get really, really nasty.

13:02.027 --> 13:04.063
When's the Iron Duke moving out?

13:04.107 --> 13:06.701
Erm, I dunno. Maybe a few weeks.

13:07.947 --> 13:12.543
- Nothing's really decided yet.
- As a fuck-off present, let's spike him.

13:12.587 --> 13:15.624
Yeah... or maybe get him
a nice watch or...

13:15.667 --> 13:18.135
He'll be like,
"Can't make the meeting, boss.

13:18.187 --> 13:22.624
"I've gotta fax my soul off to God
for an upgrade. "

13:22.667 --> 13:26.057
'It could be all right.
Mark can make us a cleaning rota.

13:26.107 --> 13:29.144
'We'll just stick religiously to the rota. '

13:31.187 --> 13:34.702
'There's probably much less
to worry about with gay sex.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.977
'You know where you are with a cock.

13:37.027 --> 13:40.258
'Still, even if I am gay, Johnson isn't.

13:40.307 --> 13:43.822
'It'll be hard enough
turning me gay, let alone... '

13:43.867 --> 13:46.335
- Hiya, Mark.
- 'OK, listen to the Johnson. '

13:46.387 --> 13:48.617
- Huh.
- 'Yes, take that. '

13:48.667 --> 13:50.464
- How are you?
- Oh, you know...

13:50.507 --> 13:52.702
'Stay strong, brother. '

13:52.747 --> 13:57.263
I've been meaning to say, about
the other day, back from the hotel...

13:57.307 --> 14:00.982
- Didn't phase me, sweetheart.
- 'That's a bit too much. '

14:01.027 --> 14:04.224
Yeah. Because, in the end,
Dave had to go early.

14:04.267 --> 14:07.896
Then I knocked on your door
and Jess said you'd gone.

14:07.947 --> 14:11.542
So that's what happened,
in case you were wondering.

14:11.587 --> 14:15.421
- Whatever.
- 'That's all very possible. '

14:16.627 --> 14:20.097
- Are you OK? You weren't pissed off?
- 'Don't weaken. '

14:20.147 --> 14:22.422
- No, no. Why?
- You seem a bit...

14:22.467 --> 14:26.779
I dunno. I hope everything's still,
with us, yeah, all right.

14:26.827 --> 14:31.537
'This is ridiculous. She's beautiful.
I'm not gay. Forget Johnson. Go for it! '

14:33.187 --> 14:34.620
Oh, Mark!

14:34.667 --> 14:36.658
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

14:36.707 --> 14:38.425
No, it's fine...

14:38.467 --> 14:40.583
Just... nothing. A bump.

14:40.627 --> 14:45.382
'It's staring you in the face, Mark.
There's only one other sex to try. '

14:45.427 --> 14:48.260
'Good old, unfriendly Mr Patel.

14:48.307 --> 14:53.176
'Never says a word, whether
you're buying cornflakes, fabric softener

14:53.227 --> 14:55.218
'or gay porn.

14:56.827 --> 14:59.546
'So here we go. Watch without prejudice.

14:59.587 --> 15:03.705
'I'm just testing the water.
I'm a sexual scientist.

15:04.747 --> 15:06.738
'So, OK, I'm keeping in trim.

15:07.427 --> 15:09.657
'This is fine. Typical evening in.

15:09.707 --> 15:14.258
'Johnson's doing the spreadsheet.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

15:14.307 --> 15:16.775
'The Romans liked it
and they got a lot done.

15:16.827 --> 15:19.102
'How's it going, Johnson? Ha-ha!

15:19.147 --> 15:21.138
'So quick?!

15:21.187 --> 15:23.496
'Yeah, some good kissing.

15:23.547 --> 15:27.301
'Maybe I'm bi-curious.
What if that actually was Johnson?

15:27.347 --> 15:29.338
'Would that make me hotter?

15:29.387 --> 15:34.017
'What if he had Sophie's face
or Sophie's body with Johnson's face?

15:34.067 --> 15:37.503
'Mum, Dad, I'm bi-curious.
Yeah, right, the bum.

15:37.547 --> 15:40.425
'Nothing wrong with a bum...

15:41.467 --> 15:45.824
'Ah, that's a little too rich for me.
I just don't know! '

15:51.227 --> 15:56.745
Do you think he really wondered, Sting,
if the Russians loved their children too?

15:56.787 --> 15:59.585
No, it's a rhetorical question.

15:59.627 --> 16:03.097
Like Can You Feel The Force?
Or Do They Know It's Christmas?

16:03.147 --> 16:06.901
I'm not so sure.
He really seems to be sincerely hoping

16:06.947 --> 16:12.465
that the Russians love their children too,
which I think is a little bit patronising.

16:12.507 --> 16:17.820
I really need to pick up my laptop from
the IT guy before Johnson gets here.

16:18.867 --> 16:20.983
I could... drive you.

16:21.027 --> 16:23.746
- What?
- Well, he gave you the keys.

16:23.787 --> 16:26.176
No, he forgot the keys after the pub.

16:26.227 --> 16:30.539
Then he called to put me in charge
of the keys until he reclaims the keys.

16:30.587 --> 16:36.901
It's probably an initiative test. Will you...
walk like some kind of stupid duck

16:36.947 --> 16:38.778
or will you drive like...

16:38.827 --> 16:40.545
Clarkson?

16:40.587 --> 16:42.703
What if something happened?

16:42.747 --> 16:47.502
Oh, right, suddenly I'm going to drive off
the non-existent quayside.

16:47.547 --> 16:50.903
I'm insured on my mum's insurance
to drive any car.

16:50.947 --> 16:55.338
It's freezing out there.
Johnson won't mind, if he's a real mate.

16:55.387 --> 16:58.936
- You're insured on any car?
- Yes!

16:58.987 --> 17:00.500
'Probably. '

17:03.067 --> 17:07.982
'Who's the Johnson now, huh?
Who's the Johnson now, Johnson? '

17:08.027 --> 17:10.301
Shall we... open her up a bit?

17:10.347 --> 17:13.703
No, absolutely not!
We're almost at the office now.

17:13.747 --> 17:17.580
If it feels good, do it.
Isn't that Johnson's philosophy?

17:17.627 --> 17:19.458
No.

17:19.507 --> 17:21.577
They love it really.

17:21.627 --> 17:26.257
God, Jeremy, no! That was Mica from...
I hope they didn't recognise me.

17:26.307 --> 17:32.576
What do you two do in the car then?
Sit and talk about the VAT on cigarillos?

17:32.627 --> 17:36.302
Of course not!
Sometimes he lets me do the gears.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.419
Hey, I've got an idea...

17:40.947 --> 17:43.256
This doesn't feel right.

17:43.307 --> 17:45.662
- This is so right.
- But I can't drive.

17:45.707 --> 17:49.586
Yes, you can. All you have to do
is believe. Driving is bullshit.

17:52.107 --> 17:53.301
Oh

17:53.347 --> 17:54.541
my

17:54.587 --> 17:55.656
God.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.540
Just very slowly
take your foot off the clutch

17:58.587 --> 18:01.055
and just tickle the accelerator, OK?

18:01.107 --> 18:03.098
OK.

18:03.147 --> 18:04.865
OK...

18:04.907 --> 18:06.784
OK.

18:06.827 --> 18:09.295
Look at me go! I'm driving!

18:09.347 --> 18:11.065
Look at me driving, Jez!

18:11.107 --> 18:14.622
- You're driving. Very slowly in first gear.
- Yeah.

18:14.667 --> 18:20.617
Yeah, come on. I'm driving. I'm Johnson.
Driving is bullshit! I'm Johnson!

18:20.667 --> 18:22.737
That's right. It's easy.

18:22.787 --> 18:26.143
Now, just give it a bit more juice
and hang a right.

18:26.187 --> 18:28.303
Right is bollocks. I'm going rogue.

18:28.347 --> 18:30.815
- Hey, isn't that Sophie?
- Jesus.

18:30.867 --> 18:34.223
Yeah, h-how do I...
How do I do stopping?

18:34.267 --> 18:36.098
The pedal. No, the middle one!

18:41.027 --> 18:45.145
- Blimey, Mark, when did you...?
- What? This old banger?

18:45.187 --> 18:47.940
It's not, is it? It's a brand-new Beamer.

18:47.987 --> 18:52.265
And you'd probably like a spin,
but we're just tooling around town.

18:52.307 --> 18:54.025
It's a guy thing.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.786
- Right.
- You sure you're all right to...?

18:56.827 --> 18:58.260
It's cool, Jez.

18:58.307 --> 19:00.537
See you around, Soph.

19:03.747 --> 19:05.339
Oh, Jesus...

19:08.267 --> 19:09.985
Wow.

19:10.027 --> 19:12.302
Alan Johnson's Beamer.

19:14.347 --> 19:16.338
Alan... Johnson's...

19:16.947 --> 19:18.824
Beamer.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.858
Do you think he's going to mind?

19:20.907 --> 19:22.977
I think it's possible he might mind.

19:23.027 --> 19:25.541
If Mark can't drive, why did he...?

19:32.707 --> 19:35.824
- You've got to help me out here.
- Sure, mate. Sure.

19:35.867 --> 19:39.177
I'll tell Super Hans
that you'll be staying now.

19:39.227 --> 19:41.502
Look, Jez, you've got to take the rap.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.981
I mean, you don't have to, but...

19:44.027 --> 19:45.824
I have a future

19:45.867 --> 19:48.335
whereas you... not don't,

19:48.387 --> 19:52.141
- just, it's different...
- 'He's grasping at straws.

19:52.187 --> 19:54.542
'It's all over for him and Johnson.

19:54.587 --> 19:58.899
'Might as well get some brownie points
by acting "the big friend".'

19:58.947 --> 20:02.462
Sure, mate.
If you really, really want me to... mate,

20:02.507 --> 20:04.498
I'll do it. I'II...

20:04.547 --> 20:06.503
face the firing squad.

20:06.547 --> 20:09.698
- True mates.
- True mates.

20:09.747 --> 20:12.864
- Ehhh...
- Uhhh...

20:14.707 --> 20:16.937
Johnson is here! Johnson is here!

20:16.987 --> 20:19.376
You're such a good guy.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.499
'We'll be in Cardiff
within the fortnight.

20:23.547 --> 20:25.458
'Relax, Mark.

20:25.507 --> 20:30.217
- 'Business before pleasure. '
- Mark, I'm a little concerned.

20:30.267 --> 20:33.896
- My 5 Series isn't where I left it.
- Alan, come in.

20:39.267 --> 20:41.576
Something terrible has happened.

20:41.627 --> 20:46.940
- What's happened to my car?
- Yes, there's a bit of a problem there...

20:46.987 --> 20:51.219
You see, I borrowed the keys,
drove it around for a bit of a laugh

20:51.267 --> 20:56.136
- and then I crashed it.
- He says "borrowed", but I had no...

20:56.187 --> 20:59.623
- Blimey.
- Yes, "blimey".

20:59.667 --> 21:02.784
Hey-ho.
So, you got the Newport projections?

21:02.827 --> 21:04.897
What? Hold on. Aren't you...?

21:04.947 --> 21:07.780
The car. You trusted...
You gave the keys to...

21:07.827 --> 21:11.263
What? I'm insured out of my arse, mate.
I'm covered.

21:11.307 --> 21:13.616
So, sushi or cappuccino? I'm easy.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.737
'Shit, he doesn't care.

21:15.787 --> 21:20.417
'Mark's in the clear. It's going to be
me and Super Hans - forever. '

21:20.467 --> 21:22.298
No, don't go, because...

21:22.347 --> 21:26.898
Sorry, Mark. I just can't take
any more lies. He smashed up your car.

21:26.947 --> 21:30.417
He did it because he hates you, really.

21:30.467 --> 21:33.106
You really are a bitter loser, aren't you,

21:33.147 --> 21:36.856
Mr No Logo,
Mr Work A Day For World Peace?

21:36.907 --> 21:39.546
- Mark, shall we split?
- But you two...

21:39.587 --> 21:42.624
This is never gonna work!
You don't know him.

21:42.667 --> 21:45.056
You don't know how he likes his toast.

21:45.107 --> 21:49.146
In a business class seat
of a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York.

21:49.187 --> 21:54.056
Wrong! He likes one brown with Marmite
and one white with lime marmalade.

21:54.107 --> 21:57.895
- I'm so outta here.
- No, don't go. You can't because...

21:57.947 --> 22:01.701
The truth is he doesn't love you
for your business plan.

22:01.747 --> 22:03.738
He loves you for your...

22:05.707 --> 22:08.699
- He loves you for you.
- Jeremy, for God's sake!

22:08.747 --> 22:13.502
Mark's gay, Johnson. I can handle that.
I'm fine with that. Are you?

22:13.547 --> 22:15.538
Look... I'm a businessman.

22:15.587 --> 22:19.296
That's what I am. That's what I do.

22:19.347 --> 22:21.542
I don't want... this.

22:21.587 --> 22:24.055
I didn't come here for this.
Mark, you don't...

22:24.107 --> 22:26.462
- love me do you?
- Love you?!

22:26.507 --> 22:28.498
Of course not!

22:28.547 --> 22:30.265
No...

22:31.027 --> 22:34.781
Yes... yes, maybe a bit.
I do possibly somewhat.

22:34.827 --> 22:38.137
But... Alan, it's not how it seems.

22:38.667 --> 22:41.306
I'm 850/0 sure I'm straight.

22:41.347 --> 22:47.297
It's just... I do have feelings for you
and, in principle, I'm not against...

22:47.347 --> 22:49.065
more...

22:49.107 --> 22:52.702
I don't think I'll know
until it's right in front of me,

22:52.747 --> 22:55.944
whether I'll be able
to go through with it, OK?

22:55.987 --> 22:58.581
You love me, not the business?

22:58.627 --> 23:00.538
I just don't know any more!

23:05.147 --> 23:06.978
I think it's best if you go now.

23:07.027 --> 23:08.506
Yeah.

23:09.987 --> 23:13.536
'My name's Andrew. I'm 25 years old.
I'm a chef. '

23:13.587 --> 23:16.499
'Not this. I don't want this.
Not now.

23:16.547 --> 23:20.142
'I'm not gay.
Possibly bi, but basically uncurious. '

23:20.187 --> 23:24.066
'I love beauty, hate arrogance
and I love sucking cock. '

23:26.107 --> 23:28.575
The bad thing...

23:28.627 --> 23:31.221
That... was the bad thing.

23:38.507 --> 23:40.737
Right, my turn now.

23:42.787 --> 23:44.584
? Don't know why

23:44.627 --> 23:47.539
? You're so blue

23:48.507 --> 23:52.102
? The sun's gonna shine
on everything you do

23:52.147 --> 23:55.105
? And the sky

23:55.147 --> 23:58.298
? Is so blue

23:59.147 --> 24:02.537
? The sun's gonna shine
on everything you do?
