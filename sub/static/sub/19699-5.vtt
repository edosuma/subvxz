WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.828
My name is H.G. Wells.

00:02.872 --> 00:05.831
My friend John
is Jack the Ripper.

00:05.875 --> 00:08.095
He's escaped from 1893
in my time machine,

00:08.138 --> 00:09.966
and I am the only one
who can catch him.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.664
Henry Ayers --
mother, Pauline.

00:12.708 --> 00:13.709
Father...

00:13.752 --> 00:14.753
John Stevenson.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.190
Henry!

00:16.233 --> 00:18.888
John's gone back to Paris
to save his son's life.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.021
I've developed
an enhancement drug

00:21.064 --> 00:22.544
from his own
genetic makeup.

00:22.587 --> 00:23.980
900 pounds means he has --

00:24.024 --> 00:25.416
He has the strength
of six men.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.070
Dr. Meyers,
what can you tell me?

00:27.114 --> 00:29.072
Your father
was a brilliant scientist,

00:29.116 --> 00:30.856
but he didn't do
the original research.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.467
Gah!

00:32.510 --> 00:35.687
There was no name on the files
other than "Utopia."

00:35.731 --> 00:37.776
There's still time
to stop it all if Vanessa --

00:37.820 --> 00:41.650
But her family destroyed ours.
Don't forget that.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.434
Henry! Henry!

00:44.566 --> 00:46.437
H.G., wake up!
Help him!

00:46.481 --> 00:48.396
Why would I?Help me get him
to the time machine.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.441
I am not going back.
Please.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.623
You really
should let me get up.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.973
No, you need to rest.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.628
What I need is a kiss.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.417
Come in.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.248
You look much better.
How are you feeling?

01:14.291 --> 01:16.859
Sore, but alive,
thanks to you, Jane,

01:16.902 --> 01:19.122
and...John, it seems.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.906
The man
is full of surprises.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.344
But I have
another one for you.

01:23.387 --> 01:26.434
Project Utopia --
So you know what it is?

01:26.477 --> 01:29.654
No, but I went to visit
an old colleague of my father's,

01:29.698 --> 01:31.700
and he said that
this was all the research

01:31.743 --> 01:33.832
my father used to build
Anders Enterprises,

01:33.876 --> 01:35.312
except it wasn't his.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.446
He stole it
from another scientist.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.448
-Who was the other scientist?
-I don't know.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.624
His name isn't in
any of the files,

01:42.667 --> 01:44.147
but look
whose name is.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.149
John Stevenson?

01:46.193 --> 01:48.325
Project Utopia's about John?
How is that possible?

01:48.369 --> 01:50.675
There's bloodwork
and a genome code of some sort.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.721
This file is dated 1980.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.244
John has never been
to 1980.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.593
Not yet, anyway.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.421
Maybe the project
hasn't even happened yet.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.815
Either way, there are
people in this time period

01:59.858 --> 02:01.338
who know about it.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.166
I found my father's colleague
dead after we spoke.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.602
Oh, God.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.169
They ruled it
heart failure.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.997
The timing
is suspicious.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.697
How do we find out
who created Utopia?

02:12.741 --> 02:14.525
What it means?

02:14.569 --> 02:17.137
Why don't we start
with John?

02:17.180 --> 02:18.790
Perhaps he can tell us
something.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.140
Mm.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.144
We have John
locked in the spare room.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.581
And we've removed
anything sharp or dangerous.

02:26.624 --> 02:29.801
He's been cuffed
and chained to the wall.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.238
So don't go beyond
the chair,

02:31.281 --> 02:32.891
and you'll stay
out of his reach.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.893
If you need us, holler.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.130
See you're alive
and well.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.523
Yes.

02:55.566 --> 02:56.654
Thank you.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.744
No, thank you...

02:59.788 --> 03:03.922
for rewarding my good behavior
so handsomely.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.229
There's something urgent
that I must discuss with you.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.579
Take these chains off
first.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.408
One act of decency
cannot undo your sins.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.671
I saved your life!

03:17.066 --> 03:18.850
You want my help?

03:18.894 --> 03:20.722
Go to hell.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.203
To await your arrival,
no doubt.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.597
Why did you save
my life, John?

03:27.946 --> 03:30.122
Why not let me die?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.081
'Cause we were friends
once.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.606
We still are.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.434
But you can't get past
the disappointment

03:37.478 --> 03:39.262
of your failed ideology
to accept that.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.133
I'm well aware
of my disappointment, John.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.657
I'm staring at it.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.398
You're also staring at the man
who saved your life.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.095
Obviously.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.619
Because you need me alive as
your ticket to the time machine.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.231
Or is it something else?

03:52.841 --> 03:54.930
This isn't
one of our chess matches.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.585
There's no need to sacrifice
my rook for your knight.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.369
Mm.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.415
I always did
fall for that move.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.808
Because you have
a perception problem.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.420
To you, everything
is left and right,

04:06.463 --> 04:09.988
good or bad,
black or white.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.296
This world isn't so rigid.

04:14.384 --> 04:17.474
It's a nasty, messy place.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.651
And to survive,

04:20.695 --> 04:22.784
you must be willing
to soil your hands,

04:22.827 --> 04:25.221
take advantage
when need be.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.877
What about when someone
takes advantage of you?

04:34.056 --> 04:35.840
I'm not sure I follow.

04:35.884 --> 04:39.017
We have discovered that someone
is conducting medical research

04:39.061 --> 04:41.150
based on your DNA,
and we don't know who,

04:41.193 --> 04:42.586
but it's part
of a Project Utopia.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.109
Have you heard
that name before?

04:44.153 --> 04:46.460
Utopia? Sounds like
something you would make up.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.636
I can assure you,
it isn't.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.334
John, there are people out there
who know about us.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.989
Wait --
come to think of it,

04:54.032 --> 04:56.948
I did encounter someone
with a medical interest in me,

04:56.992 --> 04:59.168
oh, a few days ago.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.736
You know what else
they want?

05:01.779 --> 05:03.607
Your time machine.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.435
Do hope
it's in a safe place.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.132
Who is it, John?
Tell me.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.181
You know I can't do that.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.705
It appears we have a bit
of a stalemate, old friend.

05:14.749 --> 05:18.405
You want information,
I want my freedom.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.799
Who shall bend first,
I wonder?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.846
The people behind this --

05:24.889 --> 05:27.283
they're very dangerous,
perhaps more dangerous than you.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.373
I'm fully aware
of how dangerous they are.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.506
But I assure you,

05:32.549 --> 05:36.510
there is no one here
more dangerous than me.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.611
You feel okay?

05:50.654 --> 05:52.047
It's burning some.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.180
It's just
the restriction enzymes

05:55.224 --> 05:56.617
as they enter
the bloodstream.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.923
That's what's modifying
your genetic code.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.403
The pain will subside.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.408
You guys sit tight.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.068
How's Wells?

06:13.111 --> 06:14.548
He's fine.
He bumped his head.

06:14.591 --> 06:15.679
And where's John?

06:15.723 --> 06:17.072
Vanessa has him locked up.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.422
Not exactly sure where,
but he's in the house.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.425
I could have told you
all of this over the phone.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.384
So why did you summon me?

06:24.427 --> 06:26.429
Because we need to move
right away.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.649
You mean today?

06:28.692 --> 06:31.434
Everything we want
is under one roof --

06:31.478 --> 06:33.131
Wells, John,
and the time machine.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.742
We can get everything
all at once.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.787
-Yes, but --
-Okay, wait, I'm sorry.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.963
Is this putting a wrinkle
in your schedule?

06:39.007 --> 06:40.443
John knows me.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.619
Vanessa and Wells
know about Project Utopia.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.448
It's only a matter of time
before they all start talking.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.407
So you need to stop
dragging your feet.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.411
We're ready.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.155
Okay.

06:57.199 --> 07:00.071
Today's the day.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.073
What do I have to do?

07:05.686 --> 07:07.470
Did John
tell you anything?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.341
Very little.
He claims to know more,

07:09.385 --> 07:11.300
but refuses to say
unless we free him.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.476
He may be telling the truth,
I don't know.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.173
I'm gonna bring this
to my team,

07:15.217 --> 07:17.175
see if my scientists can make
heads or tails of it.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.481
I'm not sure that's wise.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.222
Well, I'm willing
to take the risk.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.920
We need answers more than I need
to spare my father's name.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.924
Your father didn't just steal
the research, Vanessa.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.667
He killed for it.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.975
Your father murdered
Robert Holland

07:34.018 --> 07:35.324
in order to obtain it.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.762
My father did what?

07:38.806 --> 07:43.158
When Jane and I went
to your parents' home in 1980...

07:43.201 --> 07:45.552
we saw your father
kill Robert Holland.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.948
Your father didn't have
the money to pay Robert

07:50.992 --> 07:53.995
what he wanted for the stolen
research, and there was a fight.

07:54.038 --> 07:56.084
He killed him
and covered it up.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.957
And saved his company.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.394
And I know we should have told
you sooner, but you --

08:02.438 --> 08:04.309
you held your father
in such high regard,

08:04.353 --> 08:06.529
and I didn't want to destroy him
in your eyes.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.401
I'm so sorry.

08:09.445 --> 08:12.796
This is why it's imperative we
find who created Project Utopia.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.060
So sorry to interrupt,

08:16.104 --> 08:18.541
but I was looking through
all the patients' names

08:18.585 --> 08:21.370
on the test files, and it turns
out they're all deceased.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.241
But then I found
a woman's signature,

08:23.285 --> 08:25.635
a nurse who worked
on the project, Phyllis Johnson.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.115
-She's still alive?
-Yes.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.247
She's retired, 68,
lives in Harrison, New York,

08:29.291 --> 08:30.814
just about an hour
from here.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.686
I think I know someone
I can ask about the files,

08:32.729 --> 08:34.426
someone not connected
to my company.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.254
Jane and I will speak
to Miss Johnson.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.039
We will get
to the bottom of this.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.659
Thank you.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.895
This is it.

09:07.938 --> 09:11.420
It's rather eerie,
wouldn't you say?

09:11.463 --> 09:14.031
At least they don't have to
decorate for Halloween.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.685
Ah, yes,
All Hallows' Eve.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.469
Do people
still bob for apples?

09:17.513 --> 09:19.515
Not if we can help it.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.276
Can I help you?

09:41.319 --> 09:43.974
Hello, uh, I'm Jane Walker,
and this is George Wells.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.672
We're here to see
Ms. Johnson.

09:45.715 --> 09:48.109
Hi, I'm Sam. I wasn't aware
she was expecting guests.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.894
She's not. We just have a few
questions for Miss Johnson

09:50.938 --> 09:53.157
regarding work she did
on a research project

09:53.201 --> 09:54.202
a few years ago.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.986
It's for academia's sake.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.640
I see.
Oh, she loves to talk,

09:57.684 --> 09:59.642
but I'm not sure
she'll be much help.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.383
Advanced dementia.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.080
Some days you can't
reach her at all.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.561
We'd still love to try.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.825
Okay.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.533
So, she doesn't get
too many visitors,

10:21.577 --> 10:24.362
and, like I said before,
she gets confused very easily,

10:24.406 --> 10:26.887
so don't overwhelm
her with too many questions.

10:26.930 --> 10:30.238
She gets agitated.
It's the meds.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.898
It's the only way to keep her
from wandering off.

10:41.423 --> 10:44.034
Ms. Johnson.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.384
You have visitors.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.567
Hello.

10:55.611 --> 10:58.048
Hello, Ms. Johnson.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.876
I'll be in the next room.

11:15.718 --> 11:16.719
Hello?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.329
Dr. Monroe, it's Sam.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.244
Ms. Johnson just received
two guests --

11:20.288 --> 11:22.594
a woman named Jane
and a man named George.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.773
Sam, I'm gonna need you
to do something for me.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.776
Anything, Dr. Monroe.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.393
I worked on
many research projects

11:38.436 --> 11:40.395
for many different
physicians.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.877
Miss Johnson, would you mind
taking a look at this document?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.143
Is that your signature
there?

11:50.840 --> 11:54.365
Yes.
It's my signature.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.280
Do you remember working

11:56.324 --> 11:59.327
on this particular
research project?

11:59.370 --> 12:01.024
I'm retired now.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.548
Yes,
we -- we realize that.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.814
Did you work on a project
called Utopia?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.818
H.G. Wells.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.385
You know me?

12:16.910 --> 12:19.477
H.G. Wells.

12:19.521 --> 12:23.351
I've read every one
of his books.

12:24.831 --> 12:30.662
Wells wrote of Utopia
in "The Time Machine."

12:32.403 --> 12:37.452
But my favorite book
is this one --

12:37.495 --> 12:41.064
"The Island of Doctor Moreau."

12:42.326 --> 12:44.633
Why is that your favorite book,
Ms. Johnson?

12:44.676 --> 12:46.983
Because it's about me.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.508
How is it about you?

12:51.466 --> 12:53.816
The dangers of science.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.340
You're talking
about your research.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.822
Do you remember which doctor
you worked for?

12:59.866 --> 13:02.390
I can't say.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.966
Ms. Johnson,
are you okay?

13:13.009 --> 13:15.795
Yes, thank you.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.622
I-I need a minute.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.151
I got a call from Sam.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.544
Wells showed up at
Phyllis Johnson's house today.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.068
What, how'd he find her?

13:28.111 --> 13:30.026
Is she lucid enough
to talk?

13:30.070 --> 13:32.159
She's gotten better
recently.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.945
Tell me you're not experimenting
on an old lady.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.296
Sam will bring Wells
to us.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.606
We need to move...now.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.391
Brooke, thank you so much
for coming

13:47.435 --> 13:49.611
and agreeing to look
at the medical file.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.221
It's my pleasure, Vanessa,
really.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.397
I wish I could explain
all of this to you.

13:53.441 --> 13:56.270
Griffin said that discretion
is very important.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.708
Well, I've got
some phone calls to make.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.102
I'll leave you ladies to it.
-Thank you, sweetie.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.581
Yeah.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.533
Yeah?

14:42.577 --> 14:44.927
No, I'd love a sit-down
with Heller.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.537
Does he have time
this week?

14:46.581 --> 14:48.322
He's essential
to get on our side.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.019
I'll just be a second.
Do you mind?

14:50.063 --> 14:52.239
-I'll just drop my stuff.
-Thanks.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.938
No, of course.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.853
Right.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.638
No, I agree.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.336
Right.

15:04.164 --> 15:07.341
Absolutely,
the 3rd is perfect.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.473
Talk to you soon.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.084
Sorry about that, Martin.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.955
I came in looking for Wells
and got a phone call.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.304
H.G. had to run out.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.263
He asked me to come in
and do some work.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.395
Really?

15:18.439 --> 15:19.875
Anything special?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.224
That's confidential.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.009
I signed a non-disclosure
with Ms. Anders.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.795
Let me get out of your way.

15:36.152 --> 15:39.460
I was the phlebologist.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.984
I would collect
all the samples.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.160
Right, but who
were you working for?

15:44.204 --> 15:45.988
When?

15:46.032 --> 15:48.425
I-I-I'm sorry.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.992
What were
we talking about?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.776
You were talking
about Utopia.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.127
Do you remember
which doctor you worked for?

15:54.170 --> 15:58.958
Oh, I don't know
if I can talk about that.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.569
Can I?

16:02.831 --> 16:05.965
Oh, I get so confused
these days.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.228
Please, Miss Johnson,
think.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.883
Who created Project Utopia?

16:11.927 --> 16:14.190
He died a long time ago.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.018
But who was he?

16:16.062 --> 16:19.630
Well, I can't tell you,
Mr. Wells.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.284
Why not?

16:21.328 --> 16:25.985
Because one should never know
the future before it happens.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.251
What does that mean?

16:33.644 --> 16:35.559
We just want a name.

16:37.779 --> 16:41.043
Well, I suppose
it doesn't matter now.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.829
Monroe --
his name was Dr. Monroe.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.310
Monroe.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.138
As in Griffin Monroe?

16:49.182 --> 16:51.488
Yes, that's his son.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.751
And his daughter is a doctor,
Brooke Monroe?

16:53.795 --> 16:57.755
She's my doctor, yes.

16:57.799 --> 17:00.584
She's so good to me.

17:00.628 --> 17:05.024
She comes by every week
to give me my medication.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.766
Brooke and Griffin's father
created Project Utopia.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.768
The research Vanessa's father
killed for.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.949
Ms. Johnson, are okay?

17:17.993 --> 17:20.691
I'll get Sam.
You call Vanessa, you warn her.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.044
Sam?

17:35.271 --> 17:37.534
Excuse me, sir.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.153
Hello?

17:54.116 --> 17:55.248
Ugh!

18:04.083 --> 18:05.867
Where are you going?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.564
I need to leave now.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.175
You can't change
the future.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.002
I understand that.

18:11.046 --> 18:11.916
Do you?

18:11.960 --> 18:13.004
Ahh!

18:21.187 --> 18:22.884
Please, Ms. Johnson.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.103
Ah!

18:24.146 --> 18:25.713
Ah!

18:25.756 --> 18:26.801
Ugh!

18:29.369 --> 18:31.371
It was, um...

18:31.414 --> 18:32.981
I'm sorry, it's the pills.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.386
H.G.!

18:52.087 --> 18:53.044
Oh!

18:53.088 --> 18:54.437
Are you okay?

18:54.481 --> 18:56.222
Oh, my head.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.835
The man's a beast.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.186
--We have to warn Vanessa.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.622
Right.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.192
She's not picking up.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.151
Keep trying to call her.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.116
And you don't know
who John Stevenson was?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.639
Not a clue.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.556
Thank you.
I'm having trouble making sense

19:26.600 --> 19:28.689
of some of the DNA encoding
in the file.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.213
Do you have any idea
what the research is about?

19:31.257 --> 19:34.303
It's very complicated, and some
of it might be encrypted.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.609
Is there any other work
that came with it?

19:35.652 --> 19:38.264
No.
That's all I have.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.093
I'm gonna have to study it
a bit more.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.095
Is there somewhere
I can set up my laptop?

19:44.139 --> 19:45.749
Yeah.
How about the dining room?

19:45.793 --> 19:47.534
It's this way.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.305
Hey, Carl.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.089
How's it going?
-Hey.

20:21.132 --> 20:23.961
What's on your hand?

20:25.920 --> 20:26.877
Oof!

21:14.142 --> 21:15.970
The numbers seem to be
an equation

21:16.013 --> 21:18.277
for removing trace elements
from DNA sequences, but --

21:18.320 --> 21:19.756
How's it going?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.018
Can I help?

21:21.062 --> 21:22.846
It's over your head,
big brother.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.457
Mine, too.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.199
If I only I knew the methodology
behind the experiment.

21:28.243 --> 21:31.986
Um, perhaps there's
something else in the files

21:32.029 --> 21:33.640
or the laptop
that could help.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.816
Oh, I thought there was
no more research.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.296
I'm sorry, Brooke.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.950
I'm just not able to share
that information.

21:39.994 --> 21:43.040
Sweetheart, if this really is
as important as you say it is.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.477
No, Vanessa,
if there's something

21:44.520 --> 21:46.653
I'm not supposed to know,
I completely understand.

21:49.003 --> 21:51.875
Vanessa,
Brooke is my sister.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.443
You can trust her.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.319
There's more in the office.
I'll go get it.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.627
H.G., Jane,
is everything all right?

22:04.671 --> 22:07.369
Uh, Vanessa, may I speak
to you in private?

22:07.413 --> 22:08.849
It's important.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.330
I'm sorry.
I'll be just a minute.

22:18.598 --> 22:19.860
I thought Sam had them.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.557
Obviously
something went wrong.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.952
Did you download the override
program into the time machine?

22:24.995 --> 22:26.170
Where are you going?

22:26.214 --> 22:28.347
To get what I came for.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.261
What about the rest
of Cedric's files?

22:30.305 --> 22:31.567
It's all evidence.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.569
You get the files.
They figured us out.

22:33.613 --> 22:34.962
We have to move now.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.534
Robert Holland stole research
from Dr. Monroe?

22:41.577 --> 22:43.057
Dr. Monroe
died years ago.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.320
And now Brooke is continuing
her father's research.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.281
Why are they doing this?

22:50.325 --> 22:54.285
Griffin and I have been together
for over two years.

22:55.461 --> 22:58.289
This would mean
that it's all been a lie.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.859
No, there has to be
another explanation.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.296
Vanessa, wait.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.353
Where are they?

23:18.397 --> 23:19.746
The time machine --
we have to stop them.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.530
Vanessa, I'm so sorry.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.271
It's okay.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.665
Go.
Go check the time machine.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.536
Vanessa, wait.
They are very dangerous.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.321
No, go. I'll get Doug.
Go find them.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.548
Checked the basement,
no sign of Stevenson.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.029
He's here somewhere.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.597
Search the first floor
and meet me upstairs.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.383
Alex?
Cut the power.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.912
Doug?

23:58.524 --> 24:00.090
He has a pulse.

24:01.657 --> 24:02.832
What is that?

24:02.876 --> 24:05.574
A tranquilizer dart.
We have to go.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.492
Mm!

24:13.974 --> 24:16.455
H.G.?

24:18.108 --> 24:21.024
Where are you?

24:41.871 --> 24:43.351
Agh!

24:43.394 --> 24:45.222
Ah!

24:50.663 --> 24:52.229
Move.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.770
Shh.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.033
What is that?

26:00.820 --> 26:02.735
Emergency generator.

26:02.778 --> 26:05.085
What's going on
out there?

26:05.128 --> 26:06.956
They want
the time machine.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.088
Who does?

26:08.131 --> 26:09.568
Griffin
and his sister Brooke.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.700
Oh, Brooke Monroe --
she wants more than that.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.314
This one's locked
and steel-plated.

26:17.358 --> 26:18.620
He must be in there.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.324
They know we're here.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.154
Jane.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.634
Give me the keys.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.896
You know I can't do that.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.650
They will not hesitate
to kill you.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.130
Neither would you.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.178
Get under the bed.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.484
What?

26:56.527 --> 26:57.659
You heard me --
get under the bed.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.535
Jane.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.102
You have to trust me
now, Jane.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.859
Hello, John.

27:23.903 --> 27:27.036
Oh, hello again, Brooke.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.559
So nice to see you.

27:28.603 --> 27:31.258
It's good to see you,
as well.

27:31.301 --> 27:35.305
What are two here for?
Project Utopia?

27:35.349 --> 27:37.177
So you know about that.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.135
Well, I know
that you tied me up

27:39.179 --> 27:42.051
and took my blood, my DNA,
and God knows what else.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.662
We don't have time for this.
Nick.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.798
See you brought
your friend.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.861
So, where to next?

28:08.904 --> 28:11.690
Anywhere but here,
surely.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.345
Let's go.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.177
Ah.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.717
So what do you have lined up
for me this time around?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.763
Some more leather straps
and chains?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.373
You'll see.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.072
Good,
we're all together.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.856
Hello, Mr. Wells.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.946
Now, if you'll just follow me
to the time machine.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.382
I think not.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.647
Then I'll have to
kill you.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.127
I think not.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.477
You've gone through a lot
of trouble not to kill us.

29:00.521 --> 29:01.740
He makes a good point.

29:01.783 --> 29:05.134
All right, enough.
Let's go.

29:05.178 --> 29:08.747
And here we are, H.G.,
another stalemate.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.967
Unless you want to move
your rook.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.493
Ah!

29:16.537 --> 29:17.973
Oof!

29:18.017 --> 29:19.279
Ugh!

29:21.585 --> 29:22.978
Alex, the time machine.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.223
Aahhh.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.535
Aahhh!

30:17.119 --> 30:21.254
Well, suppose we're even now.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.175
He's alive.

30:29.218 --> 30:31.307
Brooke is going to try to take
the time machine.

30:31.351 --> 30:32.831
Well, we can't let her
do that.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.223
You'll help me stop her?

30:34.267 --> 30:36.095
I'll do more than that.

30:36.138 --> 30:39.054
John.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.404
He's waking up.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.406
That's impossible.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.408
Go. Stop Brooke.

30:45.452 --> 30:47.367
John, I can't allow you
to kill this man.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.760
You're really concerned
for him?

30:49.804 --> 30:51.110
You must be joking.

30:51.153 --> 30:53.329
Meet me in the ballroom.

30:53.373 --> 30:54.591
Wait.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.071
How do I know
I can trust you?

30:56.115 --> 30:58.508
You don't.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.165
Doug?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.431
Doug?

31:08.475 --> 31:09.780
Anyone?

31:17.005 --> 31:18.702
Vanessa.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.752
This has just gotten
out of control.

31:26.145 --> 31:28.364
I didn't want things
to go this far.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.497
You're looking
for the files.

31:30.540 --> 31:33.369
My father's life
was stolen from him.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.936
He died in disgrace.

31:34.980 --> 31:38.157
Project Utopia was his.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.462
How can you blame me

31:39.506 --> 31:40.899
for something my father did
30 years ago?

31:40.942 --> 31:43.423
Sweetheart,
I am not blaming you.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.556
But it's time
to make things right.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.385
Now, where are the files?

31:49.429 --> 31:51.561
I give them to you,
then what?

31:51.605 --> 31:53.389
When Brooke gets
the time machine,

31:53.433 --> 31:55.478
H.G. Wells,
and John Stevenson, I'm done.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.306
Then you and I
can go back to our lives.

31:57.350 --> 31:58.699
You're insane.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.266
I'm not giving you
anything,

32:00.309 --> 32:02.572
and you're not taking
the time machine.

32:06.185 --> 32:08.665
I really do love you,
Vanessa.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.319
Griffin.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.104
That's why
this is so hard to do.

32:12.147 --> 32:14.106
Ah!

32:14.149 --> 32:16.238
Shh, shh.
Vanessa, come on.

32:18.371 --> 32:19.807
Ah!

32:20.982 --> 32:21.940
I'm sorry.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.071
Go to hell.

32:24.638 --> 32:27.336
Griffin!
Griffin! Open the door!

32:33.386 --> 32:35.779
They must have changed
the passcode.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.705
Door's been reinforced.

32:48.749 --> 32:49.880
Can you blow it open?

32:49.924 --> 32:51.491
Yes, ma'am.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.310
Damn it.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.269
Go get her.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.199
Smart move.

33:47.242 --> 33:49.766
You had someone take the time
machine to another location.

33:49.810 --> 33:53.379
Your father, Dr. Monroe,
he created Project Utopia.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.642
What was his research
about?

33:55.685 --> 33:57.557
His dreams
were similar to yours.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.082
He wanted to improve upon the
weaknesses of the human race.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.997
Except your methods
are immoral.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.086
You obviously have a narrow way
of seeing things.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.567
Your men, their strength
is enhanced. How?

34:07.610 --> 34:09.264
Is that what
this research is about?

34:09.308 --> 34:11.049
It's much bigger than that.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.616
The woman you met today,
Phyllis,

34:13.660 --> 34:15.749
she's alive
because of the drug therapy

34:15.792 --> 34:17.446
my father created years ago.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.100
And I'm continuing it.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.841
What has it got to do
with me and John?

34:20.884 --> 34:22.147
How about this?

34:22.190 --> 34:24.627
I'll tell you everything
you want to know

34:24.671 --> 34:27.108
if you tell me
where the time machine is.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.632
It's somewhere
you'll never find it.

34:29.676 --> 34:31.678
Hmm.

34:31.721 --> 34:35.116
Well, then, you may as well have
just killed Jane yourself.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.118
Where is she?

34:37.162 --> 34:39.251
I'm sure my men
have found her by now.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.826
Oof! Where's Jane?

34:49.870 --> 34:52.655
I haven't the slightest.
I was a bit indisposed.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.440
Jane's in danger.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.233
Jane.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.366
Oh.

35:21.336 --> 35:23.730
Don't be alarmed --
John is with us.

35:23.773 --> 35:25.340
But you're fine,
you're all right?

35:25.384 --> 35:26.820
You haven't been harmed?
-Fine.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.517
What about
the time machine?

35:28.561 --> 35:30.867
Martin took it to the secure
location I discussed with him.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.304
It's safe.
Everything's fine.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.617
John killed Nick.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.143
Don't worry.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.232
This isn't over.

35:55.849 --> 35:58.373
What are you going to do
with him?

35:58.417 --> 36:00.332
Best we don't
discuss that, sir.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.166
Is there something you wish
to say to me, Jane?

36:08.209 --> 36:11.299
You didn't have to kill
that man.

36:11.343 --> 36:13.606
I assure you,
I most certainly did.

36:13.649 --> 36:16.391
And I wouldn't have been
able to kill the bastard

36:16.435 --> 36:17.784
without Wells' help.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.878
Although despicable,

36:24.921 --> 36:27.402
John's actions did most likely
save our lives.

36:27.446 --> 36:31.276
Oh, things aren't so black and
white after all, are they, H.G.?

36:32.451 --> 36:34.192
We searched
the entire house.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.585
I found Vanessa's phone,
but she isn't here.

36:36.629 --> 36:37.804
Perhaps
she fled to safety?

36:37.847 --> 36:39.501
She would never
have left you,

36:39.545 --> 36:41.982
and she would have checked in
with me by now.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.985
Clever, clever girl.

36:48.815 --> 36:51.644
Why did you take Vanessa?
That was never part of the plan.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.950
I had to improvise.
Wells moved the time machine.

36:53.994 --> 36:56.170
I can't override it
if I don't know where it is.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.258
Where is she?

36:57.302 --> 36:59.042
Why?
You want to se her?

36:59.086 --> 37:00.653
I doubt
she wants to see you.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.656
If you've hurt her...

37:03.699 --> 37:06.441
We lost our best chance
of getting the time machine,

37:06.485 --> 37:08.791
and Vanessa is all
you're worried about?

37:10.315 --> 37:11.490
Let me talk to her.

37:11.533 --> 37:12.969
Maybe I can convince her
to help us.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.755
Oh, God, you couldn't
be more delusional.

37:15.798 --> 37:18.801
She knows everything now.

37:18.845 --> 37:21.239
Your little romance
is over.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.677
You swore we could do this

37:24.720 --> 37:26.244
without Vanessa knowing
I was involved.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.159
You really believed that?

37:29.203 --> 37:32.162
You really thought that we could
just take the time machine

37:32.206 --> 37:34.556
and she would go back
to stuffing envelopes

37:34.600 --> 37:36.471
for your big Senate
campaign?

37:36.515 --> 37:40.040
You were going to torpedo
my life from the very start.

37:40.083 --> 37:42.042
Your life was a fantasy.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.522
And yours isn't?

37:43.565 --> 37:46.002
Down here with
your Frankenstein experiments?

37:46.046 --> 37:47.439
Those are
Daddy's experiments.

37:48.701 --> 37:52.182
All these years I have
put up with this obsession,

37:52.226 --> 37:56.056
but I am done sacrificing
everything for a dead man.

37:56.099 --> 37:57.449
Alex.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.539
Show my brother out.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.724
So you'll turn
against me, too?

38:11.767 --> 38:14.901
What would Daddy
think about that?

38:17.382 --> 38:20.080
Don't be melodramatic.

38:20.123 --> 38:22.212
Go home and get some rest.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.998
Tomorrow's a big day.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.015
Vanessa's in grave danger.

38:43.103 --> 38:44.583
Griffin is
a deceitful charlatan.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.454
He and his sister
are capable of anything.

38:46.498 --> 38:47.847
You're right
about that.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.459
I suspect they'll want to
exchange her

38:51.503 --> 38:54.244
for the time machine.
-And for the both of us.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.246
I've been in Brooke's clutches
before.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.727
Not an entirely
pleasurable experience,

38:58.771 --> 39:00.860
started off well, but...

39:00.903 --> 39:04.080
Mysterious doctor,
strange human experiments --

39:04.124 --> 39:06.082
I think it's all what
you based your novel on.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.607
Except for Vanessa
getting kidnapped --

39:08.650 --> 39:10.304
that really isn't in here.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.827
Yes, we're also
not on an island.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.873
Sure we are.
Manhattan is an island.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.092
May I see that please?

39:16.136 --> 39:17.746
No, we discussed this.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.792
You won't write it the same way
if you read it now.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.271
But there could be
clues inside.

39:21.315 --> 39:22.403
That's why
I'm reading it.

39:24.057 --> 39:25.841
Vanessa's phone.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.716
It's Brooke.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.761
Hello?

39:32.805 --> 39:35.285
H.G. Wells.

39:35.329 --> 39:38.201
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk more earlier.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.769
When and where do you want to
make the exchange?

39:40.813 --> 39:43.381
Well,
see how easy this is.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.645
I'll call you back
with more details.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.828
You are not
gonna do this.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.960
She might kill
Vanessa anyway.

39:58.004 --> 40:00.006
She's right about that.

40:00.049 --> 40:03.488
Brooke Monroe is not bound by
the same moral code as you.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.273
Fortunately, neither am I.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.623
So you're going to
continue to help us.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.105
First time, H.G.,

40:12.148 --> 40:15.369
it appears our goals
are aligned.
