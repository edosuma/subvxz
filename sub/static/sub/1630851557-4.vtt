WEBVTT

00:31.532 --> 00:34.493
So, who is this guy again?

00:34.576 --> 00:38.664
Who? This guy? Again?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.958
This is a megastar.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.209
He looks kinda lame.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.836
You're kind of lame.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.964
Hugo, when this guy came to Las Colinas,

00:47.047 --> 00:48.966
he was the biggest star in Mexico.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.345
I couldn't believe that I,
a poor kid from the streets of Acapulco,

00:54.012 --> 00:56.223
was going to meet Rodolfo.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.350
Nobody meets Rodolfo!

01:00.602 --> 01:02.187
I am serious.

01:02.813 --> 01:07.192
You are all to follow a strict protocol
around our very special guest.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.735
No bra signing.

01:08.819 --> 01:09.987
I'm looking at you, Lupe.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.613
His loss.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.326
I am the only one
who will deal with Rodolfo directly.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.245
Unless I tell you otherwise.

01:18.328 --> 01:23.500
He comes to the resort every year
for relaxation, peace and privacy.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.294
And that is exactly what he will get.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.422
That's not all he'll get
if you know what I'm saying.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.631
Back to work.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.551
But even the fact
that I wouldn't meet Rodolfo

01:33.135 --> 01:34.219
couldn't ruin my good mood

01:34.303 --> 01:37.264
because I was finally getting somewhere
with Julia.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.474
How cool is it
that Rodolfo is coming to our resort?

01:39.558 --> 01:41.268
I am so excited.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.145
I mean, he's Colombia's biggest star.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.772
When I was younger,
I had such a crush on him.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.316
I mean, of course now I--

01:47.816 --> 01:49.818
No, I still have a crush on him.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.070
My mom loves Rodolfo too.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.157
Whenever his name comes up,
it's like she turns into schoolgirl.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.660
I think his music reminds her
of when she was younger and dating my dad.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.162
Oh, that's so sweet.

02:01.705 --> 02:05.417
[Older Máximo] See, ever since
I stood up for her at the magazine dinner,

02:06.502 --> 02:08.211
Julia seemed to like me a little bit more

02:09.463 --> 02:10.714
and Chad a little bit less.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.798
-Hey, honey.
-Ya!

02:11.882 --> 02:12.883
Whoa.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.428
[in Spanish] Look at them, they don't even
look like they belong together.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.597
How can they think they're in love?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.850
[Memo in English] They might not be
in love, but they're still together.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.810
Just like my parents.

02:25.521 --> 02:28.357
[in English] What do you think
they're saying to each other right now?

02:29.149 --> 02:32.069
"I am so angry with you right now,
I could punch you."

02:32.152 --> 02:34.821
"You wouldn't dare punch a face
this handsome, would you?"

02:35.322 --> 02:38.116
-Okay, Chad's not that handsome.
-"I sure am, babe."

02:38.200 --> 02:42.287
"And super blonde.
Plus, did I mention how rich I am?"

02:42.371 --> 02:43.747
I don't like this game anymore.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.334
But I do like that.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.754
This is your moment, Máximo.
Go tell her how you feel.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.005
I could do that.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.801
Or what if I show her
what a good friend I am

02:55.884 --> 02:59.304
by listening to her talk
all about her problems with Chad?

02:59.805 --> 03:02.474
Then eventually, over time,

03:02.558 --> 03:05.394
she'll realize that I'm the only one
who really understands her.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.271
Yeah, you're right.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.439
Why make it simple? [chuckles]

03:13.569 --> 03:14.736
Hey.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.905
Is everything okay?

03:17.406 --> 03:19.908
-You seem down.
-I don't know, it's just a lot happening.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.244
I was already annoyed at Chad,

03:22.327 --> 03:24.121
and he just canceled our plans
for tomorrow.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.124
[in Spanish] He says he's going to take
his mom to get highlights, but...

03:27.749 --> 03:29.418
You and I know they both get them done.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.087
Well, I know for me,

03:32.171 --> 03:34.840
talking things out
always helps clear my head.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.967
Do you wanna chat tomorrow
on our lunch break?

03:37.593 --> 03:40.470
Just you, me, your feelings,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.431
maybe a chocolate ice cream cone.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.893
[in English] That'd be nice.
Ice cream sounds delicious.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.395
Oh, okay.
I guess I'll get one for you too then.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.771
[both chuckle]

03:55.903 --> 03:58.447
[in Spanish] You! Home late again
from that horrible resort.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.948
God missed you at Mass.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.075
[in Spanish] And I missed you too.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.786
Without you there,
Mom spent the whole time

04:04.870 --> 04:06.622
pointing out boys from good families
I should date.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.749
Keep your eye on that Heliodoro Pérez.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.627
Once he grows into those ears,
he's going to be very handsome.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.464
[in Spanish] Sorry I missed Mass,
but we're very busy at the resort.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.382
We have a big, important guest
arriving tomorrow.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.386
Oh, and is this person
more important than God?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.138
Of course not.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.598
It's only...

04:25.224 --> 04:25.933
Rodolfo.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.142
Rodolfo?

04:28.477 --> 04:29.937
THE Rodolfo?

04:30.020 --> 04:31.104
-[wheezes]
-[claps]

04:31.188 --> 04:33.315
In that case, God will understand!

04:33.690 --> 04:34.566
It's Rodolfo!

04:34.858 --> 04:36.777
Mom, are you blushing?

04:36.860 --> 04:37.194
No.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.947
Am I? Of course not.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.699
I don't know,
I just suddenly feel very warm.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.161
I'm just saying he's a very handsome man.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.746
[in Spanish] Who is a handsome man?

04:47.829 --> 04:48.372
[Nora] Nobody!

04:55.295 --> 04:57.798
Wow. I suddenly feel very warm.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.051
I need a glass of water.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.345
[footsteps departing]

05:03.428 --> 05:05.597
I can't believe
you set up Mom and Esteban!

05:06.056 --> 05:07.182
They're going out to lunch.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.559
I can't think of a worse couple.

05:08.976 --> 05:09.768
I can.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.813
Heliodoro Pérez... and me.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.694
[in English] That's when I decided,

05:18.777 --> 05:21.697
"That's it. I'm not going to
watch telenovelas anymore."

05:23.448 --> 05:24.908
You don't have to look so concerned.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.536
You know I always say that,
but I keep watching.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.080
[in Spanish] Hey, what's up, guys?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.374
I'm from Espectacular Magazine!

05:32.875 --> 05:34.585
What time is your special guest arriving?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.670
We don't know when Rodolfo's getting here.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.255
Ah, so Rodolfo is coming!

05:38.338 --> 05:39.548
What? No! Stop it!

05:39.715 --> 05:40.841
[in Spanish]
We're not telling you anything.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.259
[man speaks Spanish]

05:42.342 --> 05:45.179
-[Pedro Marin's "Aire" playing]
-[fans screaming, clamors]

05:45.804 --> 05:46.889
[man] Rodolfo!

05:47.764 --> 05:49.433
[camera shutters clicking]

05:51.518 --> 05:53.645
[in English] This is perfect.

05:53.729 --> 05:56.607
Every one of my sisters
asked me to get a poster signed for them.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.985
If I get Rodolfo's autograph
before he's actually in the building,

06:00.485 --> 06:03.155
I technically won't have done
anything wrong! [chuckles]

06:03.780 --> 06:05.699
[clamoring continues]

06:15.042 --> 06:17.753
Rodolfo! Can you sign these posters?
They're for my--

06:19.046 --> 06:21.924
Oh, please. Please. No autographs.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.634
[grunts]

06:23.717 --> 06:27.429
[Older Máximo] You see,
Don Pablo was always one step ahead.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.557
The limo was just a distraction

06:30.641 --> 06:33.227
so Rodolfo could arrive in peace.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.229
Gracias.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.565
-[woman] Rodolfo. [squeals]
-[Don Pablo] Rodolfo.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.234
[Rodolfo in Spanish]
Don Pablo, my old friend!

06:42.110 --> 06:43.070
[Don Pablo speaks Spanish]

06:43.153 --> 06:44.071
[Rodolfo speaks Spanish]

06:52.996 --> 06:54.915
[Older Máximo]
With Chad away for the day,

06:54.998 --> 06:57.543
I was excited to have some alone time
with Julia.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.171
But suddenly, I had a bigger problem.

07:01.255 --> 07:06.218
A richer, handsomer,
sexier, famouser problem.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.974
See all those video cameras?

07:12.474 --> 07:13.892
They're for Rodolfo's villa.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.395
He likes to record himself and his…

07:17.563 --> 07:19.398
activities with ladies.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.149
If you know what I mean.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.612
You like fashion,
but haven't been to Milan?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.073
[in Spanish] I wish!
I haven't even been to Mexico City.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.283
[Rodolfo] That's a tragedy.

07:29.908 --> 07:30.993
You must go.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.662
You would fit in exquisitely.

07:34.997 --> 07:35.998
Because you are gorgeous.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.040
Thank you.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.251
[man] Your massage is ready.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.502
I'll walk with you to the spa,

07:40.586 --> 07:42.963
then I need to talk about
your European tour schedule.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.257
[in English] It's always work, work, work
with this one, huh?

07:45.757 --> 07:47.134
Do you wanna walk with us?

07:47.217 --> 07:47.759
Me?

07:48.010 --> 07:48.552
[in Spanish] Yes.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.304
I would love to keep talking with you.

07:50.596 --> 07:51.138
Yes, of course.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.014
Wonderful.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.390
[chuckles]

07:54.057 --> 07:56.310
[Rodolfo speaks Spanish]

07:56.393 --> 07:57.394
[both chuckle]

07:57.477 --> 08:01.315
[Julia speaks Spanish]

08:09.072 --> 08:10.240
[exhales]

08:13.535 --> 08:17.539
Ugh, these glasses make me
look like an old woman.

08:17.623 --> 08:18.665
No they don't.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.210
They make you look like
a very pretty woman…

08:22.085 --> 08:23.545
who can't see very well.

08:23.629 --> 08:24.838
Mmm.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.799
You are going to make a wonderful wife
for Heliodoro Pérez.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.179
Your children will have hearts
as big as their ears.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.514
-[knocks on door]
-[gasps]

08:33.972 --> 08:34.640
Wait for me.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.645
[speaks Spanish]

08:45.150 --> 08:45.817
Hello, Sara.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.903
I brought you a plant
because I couldn't find any flowers.

08:48.820 --> 08:49.571
Nora...

08:50.197 --> 08:52.282
You look prettier than I even imagined.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.243
I mean, I'm not saying
that you aren't pretty in real life,

08:54.326 --> 08:55.577
but when I imagine you...

08:56.495 --> 08:57.412
that, uh... shall we go?

08:58.121 --> 08:58.497
Excuse me.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.713
Oh Mom, can I go to a concert
with Gabriela while you're out?

09:06.922 --> 09:07.422
No!

09:08.006 --> 09:09.883
That Gabriela is a bad influence.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.469
I saw her in the courtyard with
a pack of cigarettes and a skateboard.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.471
Nice girls ride bicycles.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.390
You will stay home tonight while I'm out.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.015
But, Mom--

09:17.099 --> 09:19.309
I said stay home.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.854
And Gabriela is not to set foot
through this door, understand?

09:22.563 --> 09:23.522
Don't worry.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.107
She won't.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.486
Why are you here and not at the concert?

09:29.570 --> 09:30.779
You should have gone without me.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.323
The tickets were all sold out. But look...

09:35.075 --> 09:35.951
I brought your stuff back.

09:36.034 --> 09:36.910
Thanks.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.705
Sorry my mom thought they were yours,

09:39.788 --> 09:40.747
but you really saved me.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.748
It's okay.

09:42.124 --> 09:42.666
Plus...

09:43.208 --> 09:44.668
now your mom must think I'm cool.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.701
Looks like she's having a good time, no?
Chad better watch out.

10:19.745 --> 10:23.040
How can anyone compete
with Rodolfo's seductive ways?

10:25.042 --> 10:26.210
Oh, wow.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.587
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm a close second.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.297
But he's the master.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.258
Mmm. Ooh.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.220
[Máximo in English]
Don Pablo, I hate to be that guy,

10:36.303 --> 10:38.096
but you said no talking to Rodolfo.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.474
What's going on in there?
He's clearly very annoyed.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.104
The guest gets what the guest wants.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.359
I hope those are not
for people at the pool.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.069
No, they're for me…

10:52.611 --> 10:53.862
and you?

10:53.946 --> 10:56.532
Throw them out, clean your hands,
and come with me.

10:56.615 --> 10:57.991
I have an important assignment for you.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.826
[singing continues]

11:19.137 --> 11:21.890
Stand here
at the entrance to Rodolfo's villa.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.810
No one goes in or out
without my permission.

11:25.561 --> 11:26.812
Do not leave your post.

11:27.729 --> 11:31.149
So my important assignment
is to stand here?

11:31.233 --> 11:33.902
Yes. I had to move some security around.

11:34.403 --> 11:36.780
A fan tried to climb a tree
to get to Rodolfo

11:36.864 --> 11:38.282
and fell into the resort.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.408
Oh, no. Were they hurt?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.492
Not yet.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.089
[Esteban sighs]

11:55.090 --> 11:56.091
[blows]

12:14.526 --> 12:17.779
Are you sure you don't want to
take your jacket off?

12:18.280 --> 12:20.699
No, no, I am actually a bit chilly.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.247
Do you know what you're going to order?

12:33.462 --> 12:35.130
Oh, I'm actually not that hungry.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.187
So, what do you think of
the current popular cinema?

12:51.355 --> 12:53.106
Oh...
I don't really go to the movies very much.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.118
So, what do you think of
the current popular sports teams?

13:08.622 --> 13:11.583
And now my mom wants me
to go out with Heliodoro Pérez!

13:12.543 --> 13:13.752
Can you believe that?

13:13.836 --> 13:14.419
Well...

13:14.670 --> 13:17.256
at least he'd be a good listener?

13:18.882 --> 13:22.010
Seriously,
who'd want to go out with Heliodoro Pérez?

13:22.094 --> 13:23.720
Or any boys for that matter.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.141
Can I tell you a secret?

13:30.978 --> 13:33.605
I actually did get tickets
for the show tonight. But...

13:34.273 --> 13:36.233
I thought it would be more fun
to just spend time with you instead.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.200
Thanks to Don Pablo's busy work,

13:45.284 --> 13:47.578
the one day I had a chance with Julia,

13:48.161 --> 13:50.497
I was stuck
as far away from her as possible.

13:50.581 --> 13:51.582
Hello, sir.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.709
Don Pablo has you standing out here?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.044
If any crazy fans show up,

13:56.128 --> 13:58.046
I'm gonna sweat on them
until they go away.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.923
Well, I know Rodolfo appreciates it.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.550
He has special plans.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.469
And I know he won't wanna be disturbed.
[clicks tongue]

14:06.680 --> 14:10.684
[Older Máximo] He wasn't talking about
Rodolfo and Julia, was he?

14:12.102 --> 14:14.396
No, there was no way.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.731
[Rodolfo chuckles]

14:19.776 --> 14:22.321
-[Julia whispers, chuckles]
-[chuckles]

14:34.708 --> 14:37.002
Hugo, I'll admit it.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.545
I was spiraling.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.297
My mind was racing.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.965
My heart was pounding.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.509
All I could think about

14:44.176 --> 14:46.220
was that the woman I was crazy about

14:46.303 --> 14:49.181
was entering the den
of a seductive megastar

14:49.264 --> 14:52.935
who was known for recklessly
spreading his seed across the globe.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.186
Gross.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.980
[Older Máximo]
I had to do something to stop them.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.441
But I couldn't just barge in.

15:01.276 --> 15:01.944
[in Spanish] Memo!

15:02.236 --> 15:03.695
Rodolfo needs more clean towels!

15:03.779 --> 15:04.446
Fast!

15:04.530 --> 15:05.822
[panting]

15:06.406 --> 15:08.408
[in Spanish]
These are bedsheets. And they're dirty!

15:08.492 --> 15:09.076
Close enough!

15:10.661 --> 15:11.787
You cannot take those.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.372
Lupe, please, they're for Rodolfo--

15:14.873 --> 15:15.999
Take these instead.

15:16.208 --> 15:20.838
I sprayed them with my own perfume so
Rodolfo will recognize my womanly essence.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.259
Also, I knitted him socks.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.428
And I baked him some cookies.

15:28.971 --> 15:32.391
And if you can slip my nephew's demo tape
in between them...

15:33.475 --> 15:34.268
Hurry.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.409
[in English] Housekeeping!

16:07.926 --> 16:09.303
[clatters]

16:10.304 --> 16:11.513
[shutter clicking]

16:11.597 --> 16:13.015
-[man] Oh, my God.
-[Rodolfo] No, no, no! Hey!

16:13.098 --> 16:15.184
[speaks Spanish]

16:28.447 --> 16:30.616
[people speak indistinctly]

16:31.241 --> 16:32.242
[Hugo] Stop.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.077
That didn't happen. [chuckles]

16:34.161 --> 16:36.622
Well, I might be getting this confused

16:36.705 --> 16:39.374
with an action movie
I saw around the same time.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.710
But this is how I remember it.

16:45.839 --> 16:46.882
[gunshots]

16:54.264 --> 16:56.183
-[gunshots continue]
-[woman screams]

16:56.975 --> 16:58.769
-[yelps, grunts]
-[people screaming]

17:00.020 --> 17:01.730
I owe you my life.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.482
Okay, come on.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.609
[scoffs] Okay. The point is, I lost him.

17:07.611 --> 17:08.612
Just like that,

17:08.694 --> 17:10.614
the paparazzo was gone.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.200
Rodolfo's entire world…

17:13.700 --> 17:15.827
was about to come crashing down

17:16.328 --> 17:20.540
and it was all because
of my blind jealousy.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.542
[in English] How did this happen?

17:22.626 --> 17:23.836
It's all my fault.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.964
I left the gate for a few minutes,
and that's when the man got in.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.384
I'm sorry.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.804
I understand if you want to fire me.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.430
-Hmm.
-[door opens]

17:37.099 --> 17:39.434
-Wait. How did you--
-Rodolfo told me what happened,

17:39.518 --> 17:41.061
so I called some friends.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.146
[in Spanish] I have many friends.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.606
Sit.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.905
Ignacio Porras...

17:52.406 --> 17:54.449
from Espectacular Magazine!

17:55.617 --> 17:58.537
Any relation to Lorena Porras, by chance?

17:59.079 --> 17:59.788
[in Spanish] She's my cousin.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.290
Interesting.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.168
And how is Dona Isabel?
Does she still live on Allende Street?

18:04.710 --> 18:06.461
How do you know where my mother lives?

18:09.298 --> 18:10.507
Look Nacho...

18:11.300 --> 18:13.635
I wonder if we could help each other out.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.181
You have some photos
of one of our guests...

18:17.848 --> 18:19.850
And I have this video tape of you...

18:20.267 --> 18:22.186
trespassing.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.814
Which would get you three years in prison.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.193
Trespassing
doesn't get you three years in prison.

18:29.943 --> 18:30.903
Yes, it does.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.865
When you have a close friendship
with the chief of police.

18:35.949 --> 18:36.867
Three years.

18:38.410 --> 18:39.161
What do you say?

18:40.704 --> 18:41.705
Can we help each other out?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.926
You made the correct decision.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.386
But let me tell you something.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.764
I only give one warning.

18:59.014 --> 19:03.352
The next time you put
one of our guests at risk…

19:06.772 --> 19:08.524
I won't be so understanding.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.537
So... did I tell you the story
about the gumball machine when I got--

19:21.620 --> 19:22.329
Two gumballs.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.456
Yes, you told me about that.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.501
It was exciting.

19:28.710 --> 19:29.670
I can imagine.

19:33.215 --> 19:33.715
Young man!

19:34.091 --> 19:35.467
Could you please bring us our check?

19:36.009 --> 19:36.552
Me?

19:36.635 --> 19:37.219
Yes.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.263
I don't work here.

19:39.596 --> 19:40.722
Oh, I'm sorry...

19:43.600 --> 19:44.893
I thought he was our waiter.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.897
Don't worry.
He did kind of look like our waiter.

19:48.981 --> 19:50.315
Aside from him being bigger.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.359
Almost bald.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.403
And the mustache.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.738
Which our server didn't have
because she was a woman.

19:57.614 --> 19:58.115
But--

19:58.198 --> 20:00.200
Look, the truth, Esteban, is that…

20:01.118 --> 20:02.119
I can barely see anything.

20:02.369 --> 20:02.786
What?

20:02.870 --> 20:04.955
I don't see well.
I should have worn my glasses.

20:05.414 --> 20:06.540
Why didn't you?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.584
Well, because...

20:10.335 --> 20:14.882
I'm still not used to them.
They're too big, I feel ridiculous.

20:15.424 --> 20:18.302
And I didn't want to look bad
on my first date...

20:19.219 --> 20:19.845
in...

20:21.221 --> 20:22.973
such a long time.

20:26.310 --> 20:30.731
I wear glasses. Don't be embarrassed.
There is no way you could ever look bad.

20:31.899 --> 20:33.358
You always look so beautiful.

20:34.318 --> 20:35.569
Glasses or not.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.575
You want to hear something
truly embarrassing?

20:51.335 --> 20:54.171
I was rushing to meet you
and I spilled coffee on myself.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.382
I didn't want to be late,
but didn't have another good dress shirt.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.219
So I thought,
if I just keep my coat zipped up,

21:00.302 --> 21:02.387
maybe you wouldn't find out...

21:03.096 --> 21:04.181
What a dummy I am!

21:09.895 --> 21:10.979
Excuse me.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.191
I kept thinking,

21:14.274 --> 21:16.693
oh my God, this man is melting!

21:16.777 --> 21:17.653
Why is that?

21:18.570 --> 21:20.030
Oh, so you noticed.

21:20.113 --> 21:23.158
Of course I noticed!
My eyes are bad, but I'm not blind.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.954
Now that we're being honest…

21:27.746 --> 21:28.914
How ridiculous!

21:30.249 --> 21:33.001
Good, you're still here.
I thought you might have left for the day.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.881
-No. I'm just waiting for Don Pablo.
-I'd better give you this before he sees.

21:39.383 --> 21:40.592
It's for your mom.

21:40.676 --> 21:42.177
Rodolfo gave it to me.

21:42.261 --> 21:43.387
It's signed.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.596
This is amazing.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.058
Wait.
Is that why you went to Rodolfo's villa?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.853
Yes. When I saw you at the pool,

21:50.936 --> 21:53.480
I remembered
I was supposed to hang out with you.

21:53.564 --> 21:54.982
So I told Rodolfo how bad I felt,

21:55.065 --> 21:58.110
so he offered to give me a signed cassette
to make it up to you.

21:59.862 --> 22:01.196
What's so funny?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.532
I went bursting in there to save you.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.076
To save me from what?

22:06.159 --> 22:09.913
I see you going in there with him,
so, you know, I had to do something.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.751
I'm confused.
Why did you think I needed saving?

22:14.835 --> 22:17.462
I just heard rumors about Rodolfo.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.423
-I thought that--
-You thought that

22:19.506 --> 22:22.217
he was going to take advantage
of some naive young girl?

22:22.301 --> 22:24.052
Is that what you actually think of me?

22:24.136 --> 22:27.639
A damsel in distress who can't be trusted
with her own choices?

22:28.140 --> 22:30.642
I appreciate your concern, Máximo,

22:30.726 --> 22:33.478
but I know how to take care of myself, so…

22:33.562 --> 22:34.771
Yes, of course you do.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.107
But I know
that you and Chad were fighting--

22:37.191 --> 22:39.818
My relationship with Chad
is my own business. All right?

22:40.402 --> 22:41.904
Yes, he drives me crazy,

22:41.987 --> 22:44.990
but he's honest and he's sweet.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.451
And he knows that I have the right
to make my own decisions.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.412
Hey. I got back early.

22:51.622 --> 22:53.415
Just wanted to see you
before you went home.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.292
How's your day been?

22:55.375 --> 22:57.085
It was great until it wasn't.

22:58.504 --> 22:59.505
How about now?

23:00.422 --> 23:01.757
How did you know I was hungry?

23:03.884 --> 23:04.885
Just know.

23:08.889 --> 23:12.768
So wait, are you still mad at me?
Got it, totally still mad at me.

23:12.851 --> 23:14.353
I'm still mad at me too.

23:20.234 --> 23:24.279
Máximo,
let's go give Rodolfo the good news.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.616
I should have known
I'd be safe in your hands,

23:27.699 --> 23:29.409
good old friend.

23:32.621 --> 23:34.039
Never doubt Don Pablo.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.541
He's always one step ahead.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.209
I know that now.

23:39.336 --> 23:40.337
Thank you.

23:40.838 --> 23:44.758
Do you see now why discretion is
so important here at the resort?

23:45.384 --> 23:46.385
I do.

23:46.885 --> 23:49.054
I thought Rodolfo was some womanizer,

23:49.680 --> 23:51.849
but the truth is so much more scandalous.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.017
Is it?

23:55.686 --> 23:59.147
Here at Las Colinas, we do not judge.

23:59.231 --> 24:04.444
And yes, sometimes things happen here
that would bother others.

24:04.778 --> 24:05.904
On the other hand...

24:06.822 --> 24:10.158
Rodolfo and David have been together
for nearly twenty years.

24:11.076 --> 24:14.955
And this is the only place
besides their home

24:15.038 --> 24:16.790
where they can truly be together.

24:16.999 --> 24:17.708
So...

24:18.333 --> 24:21.503
is Las Colinas bad,
and the rest of the world good?

24:23.005 --> 24:24.089
Maybe.

24:25.048 --> 24:28.719
Or maybe it's more complicated than that.

24:29.261 --> 24:30.804
That's actually kind of sad.

24:30.888 --> 24:31.930
Yeah.

24:32.014 --> 24:35.309
I never knew how hard it was
to be a gay person in the olden days.

24:36.226 --> 24:39.771
It wasn't the olden days. It was the '80s.

24:41.023 --> 24:42.816
But right. Me neither.

24:44.193 --> 24:46.945
We didn't even speak of such things
when I was your age.

24:47.779 --> 24:48.780
Look at this.

24:56.330 --> 24:57.998
Although the world didn't know it,

24:58.749 --> 25:02.169
Rodolfo really was
singing to his true love in that video,

25:03.420 --> 25:04.546
the only way he could.

25:12.179 --> 25:14.681
I thought love was simple and obvious.

25:15.641 --> 25:18.393
It had to make sense to me
in order to be right.

25:22.272 --> 25:24.399
That was the first time I realized

25:26.026 --> 25:29.488
love doesn't give a crap
about what I think.

25:32.115 --> 25:35.661
Love isn't about how it looks to people
on the outside.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.790
It's about how it feels to the people
who are in love,

25:39.873 --> 25:41.834
and that's all that matters.

25:44.503 --> 25:48.632
Of course, I still had
a lot more to learn about love,

25:49.508 --> 25:50.926
about morality,

25:51.009 --> 25:52.427
about everything.

25:54.137 --> 25:57.724
But now, at least,
my eyes were beginning to open.
