WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.209
Man:
PREVIOUSLY, ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.309 --> 00:10.644
Paul:
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR FATHER WAS IN MIAMI?

00:10.744 --> 00:11.845
WHY WAS IT A SECRET?

00:11.945 --> 00:13.547
IT'S NOT A FUCKING SECRET.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.583
SO HE STILL
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT
YOUR ATTEMPTED SUICIDE?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.985
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
THAT I TOOK THOSE PILLS.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.620
ARE YOU ANGRY AT HIM
FOR SOMETHING?

00:19.720 --> 00:21.589
SHUT THE FUCK UP
ABOUT HIM!

00:24.958 --> 00:27.195
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER
SOMETHING, SOPHIE.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.263
THERE ARE OTHER PLACES
WHERE YOU CAN FEEL SAFE,

00:29.363 --> 00:31.165
AND HERE IN THIS ROOM

00:31.265 --> 00:33.734
IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.376
OH.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.812
HOLD UP, PAUL.
I JUST GOTTA FINISH THIS.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.284
TAKE YOUR TIME.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.686
I'LL JUST GOOGLE MYSELF.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.688
( chuckles )

00:54.788 --> 00:56.357
IT'S MY DAD.
HE'S IN BOSTON.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.259
I MIGHT GO VISIT HIM
NEXT WEEK.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.527
MMM.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.363
OH MY GOD,
THE MOST AMAZING THING
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.198
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME, BUT...

01:04.298 --> 01:06.667
- I DON'T CARE.
- WELL, WHY WOULDN'T
I BELIEVE YOU?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.202
BECAUSE...

01:08.302 --> 01:10.504
YOU THINK THAT
MY DAD AND ME BEING
CONNECTED IS BULLSHIT.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.406
I NEVER SAID IT
WAS BULLSHIT.
I SAID I--

01:12.506 --> 01:14.275
I MIGHT
BE SURPRISED, BUT--

01:14.375 --> 01:16.544
FREE YOUR MIND, PAUL.
THE REST WILL FOLLOW.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.746
MMM.

01:18.846 --> 01:19.880
HMM.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.316
( theme music playing )

01:40.501 --> 01:42.703
OH MY GOD,
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.338
I HAD THIS DREAM

01:44.438 --> 01:46.374
THAT MY FATHER
WAS IN DANGER.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.642
I WOKE UP FEELING
A LITTLE FREAKED, YOU KNOW?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.411
SO I CALLED HIM.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.147
HE'S STAYING IN A HOTEL
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.649
TURNS OUT, LAST NIGHT,

01:55.749 --> 01:59.353
SOMEBODY BROKE
INTO HIS ROOM AND STOLE
HIS FAVORITE CAMERA.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.523
HMM.

02:04.057 --> 02:08.329
SO GUESS
YOU MUST BE FEELING
PRETTY SILLY NOW, HUH?

02:12.166 --> 02:13.901
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU HAVE
ALL THESE DOUBTS

02:14.001 --> 02:15.803
ABOUT MY FATHER
AND OUR TELEPATHY.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.638
YOU BASICALLY
HATE THE MAN.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.039
I HATE YOUR FATHER?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.642
LAST WEEK YOU WERE
INSINUATING--

02:21.742 --> 02:23.977
FORGET IT.
THE POINT IS,
WE'RE CONNECTED.

02:24.077 --> 02:27.515
IT'S BEEN PROVEN
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.289
YOU SAID THAT--
THAT YOU MIGHT
GO TO BOSTON.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.825
DON'T YOU HAVE
THE OLYMPIC TRIALS
COMING UP?

02:37.925 --> 02:40.428
THOSE ARE
AFTER I GET BACK.

02:40.528 --> 02:44.298
SO IT'S OKAY TO MISS
TRAINING THIS CLOSE
TO A COMPETITION, IS IT?

02:44.398 --> 02:47.835
OH, I'M SORRY, CY.
I WAS LOOKING
FOR MY SHRINK.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.470
( chuckles )

02:51.038 --> 02:53.574
- HMM.
- LOOK, IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.577
IT'S JUST MORE IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO SPEND QUALITY
TIME WITH HIM.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.112
- IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.
- WELL, MAYBE HE COULD
COME HERE?

02:59.213 --> 03:02.550
THAT WAY YOU COULD
SEE HIM AND YOU COULD
STILL CONTINUE TO TRAIN.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.685
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

03:04.785 --> 03:07.221
DID YOU, LIKE,
BET ON ME TO WIN
A MEDAL OR SOMETHING?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.557
( chuckles )

03:09.657 --> 03:12.159
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR FATHER?

03:12.260 --> 03:15.095
ABOUT...
SIX MONTHS AGO.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.497
HE WAS IN TOWN
FOR A WEEKEND.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.332
AND HOW WAS THAT?
WAS IT FUN?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.169
IT WAS FINE.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.472
WE WENT TO
THIS FANCY RESTAURANT.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.939
HIS GIRLFRIEND
CAME WITH US.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.876
AND MY DAD
STARTED FLIRTING
WITH THE WAITRESS.

03:28.976 --> 03:32.613
HIS GIRLFRIEND
STARTED TO CRY.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.148
SO WE HAD TO LEAVE,
WHICH KIND OF SUCKED, BUT...

03:35.249 --> 03:38.018
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT WAS FINE.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.220
WAS IT THE SAME GIRL
FROM BOSTON?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.189
I THINK SO.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.991
WHO CAN KEEP UP?

03:47.928 --> 03:50.130
HOW DID YOU
GET ON WITH HER?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.565
FINE.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.367
SHE'S PEACHY.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.336
MMM.
WHAT'S HER NAME AGAIN?

03:55.436 --> 04:00.073
DARREN, TARYN, KAREN--
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.909
CLEO.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.345
I THINK
IT'S STILL CLEO.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.647
I'M LIKE THE LITTLE SISTER
SHE NEVER HAD.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.248
( chuckles )

04:11.319 --> 04:13.621
I WISH HE'D LEAVE HER
IN BOSTON.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.626
WE HAVEN'T TAKEN
A TRIP TOGETHER--
JUST MY DAD AND ME--

04:18.726 --> 04:21.895
- SINCE MY 13TH BIRTHDAY.
- WHERE DID YOU GO THEN?

04:21.995 --> 04:24.064
WE WENT TO PARIS.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.733
HE TOOK ME
TO EVERYTHING

04:25.833 --> 04:29.470
FROM THE EIFFEL TOWER
TO MONET'S GARDEN--
THE WORKS.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.072
AT THIS SIDEWALK CAFE
I HAD THIS CUP OF CHOCOLATE.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.974
YOU HAD TO EAT IT
WITH A SPOON.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.877
TWO WORDS-- AWE-SOME.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.012
( chuckles )

04:39.112 --> 04:41.214
WE STAYED IN
THIS HUGE APARTMENT.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.750
IT WAS LIKE A LOFT.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.219
BELONGED TO SOME WOMAN--
I MET HER FOR, LIKE,
FIVE SECONDS

04:46.320 --> 04:48.489
JUST AS I WAS LEAVING
TO FLY BACK HOME.

04:48.589 --> 04:52.360
SHE WAS GOING
INTO THE APARTMENT
AS I WAS GOING OUT.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.028
THE ELEVATOR REEKED
OF HER PERFUME.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.864
MADE ME WANT
TO THROW UP.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.200
I DID, LITERALLY.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.804
RIGHT ON THE STREET
IN FRONT OF THE CAB.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.139
NOBODY SAW IT.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.175
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
THE CABBIE SAW,

05:08.275 --> 05:11.812
BUT MY DAD DIDN'T.
HE STAYED UPSTAIRS.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.348
SO YOU TOOK A CAB
TO THE AIRPORT
BY YOURSELF?

05:14.448 --> 05:17.518
UH, YEAH,
I WAS 13, PAUL.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.454
HMM.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.025
SO YOU WANT
TO TELL ME MORE ABOUT
THAT DREAM THAT YOU HAD?

05:29.096 --> 05:31.365
NOT REALLY.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.834
IT'S JUST
A STUPID DREAM.

05:33.934 --> 05:37.805
BUT I FELT THAT
HE WAS IN DANGER--
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.408
I CAN FEEL HIM.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.042
WE'RE LINKED.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.877
"RADAR LOVE."

05:50.951 --> 05:53.421
IT WAS
A TERRIBLE DREAM.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.322
MORE LIKE
A NIGHTMARE.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.290
DO YOU GET THOSE?

05:57.391 --> 05:59.026
SOMETIMES.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.497
WHAT HAPPENS
IN YOURS?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.701
WELL...

06:07.801 --> 06:11.204
THERE'S ONE I'VE--
I'VE HAD...

06:11.304 --> 06:15.743
CONSISTENTLY SINCE
I WAS A KID.

06:15.843 --> 06:19.447
I'M SITTING IN THIS
ROCKING CHAIR AND I'M
ROCKING BACK AND FORWARD,

06:19.547 --> 06:21.715
AND EVERY TIME
I GO TO GET OFF,
I CAN'T GET OFF,

06:21.815 --> 06:24.317
AND THE CHAIR KEEPS
ROCKING BACK AND FORWARD.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.220
AND MY-- MY MOTHER
IS CALLING ME

06:27.320 --> 06:28.756
FROM UPSTAIRS,

06:28.856 --> 06:31.291
AND I-- I'M TRYING TO
GET OUT OF THE CHAIR,

06:31.391 --> 06:35.128
BUT I--
I JUST CAN'T LET GO.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.164
( sighs )

06:39.800 --> 06:42.269
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT MEANS?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.738
I THINK
IT MEANS THAT...

06:44.838 --> 06:48.709
UH, MAYBE THAT
I AM SCARED THAT I'M GONNA
DISAPPOINT MY MOTHER,

06:48.809 --> 06:51.078
THAT I'M NOT GONNA
BE THERE FOR HER.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.981
DID YOU DISAPPOINT HER...

06:54.081 --> 06:56.149
IN REAL LIFE?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.786
NO, I...

06:59.920 --> 07:01.555
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.495
ANYWAY, BACK TO
YOUR DREAM.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.167
OKAY, SO...

07:14.267 --> 07:17.638
I WAS WAITING
FOR MY FATHER
IN A HOTEL ROOM...

07:17.738 --> 07:20.373
WHEN A MAN KNOCKED
ON THE DOOR.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.576
I LET HIM IN.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.578
HE ASKED ME WHERE
MY FATHER WAS,

07:24.678 --> 07:27.815
AND I TOLD HIM
HE WAS ON HIS WAY.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.850
JUST AS I SAID IT--
I WAS SO STUPID--

07:29.950 --> 07:32.886
I REALIZED
THAT THIS GUY WAS
A SERIAL KILLER.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.957
SO HE SAT DOWN
TO WAIT WITH ME,

07:37.057 --> 07:40.594
AND I KNEW THAT
THE MOMENT MY FATHER
WALKED INTO THAT ROOM,

07:40.694 --> 07:43.030
THIS GUY WAS
GOING TO KILL HIM.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.099
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO STOP IT.
IT WAS AWFUL.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.537
WHAT DID THE MAN
LOOK LIKE?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.506
I DON'T REMEMBER.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.509
HAD YOU BEEN IN
THIS HOTEL ROOM BEFORE?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.080
NO.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.917
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?
CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.454
IT WAS DARK--

08:07.555 --> 08:11.559
DARK WOOD,
DARK FURNITURE.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.894
SORT OF LIKE A CAVE
OR A TUNNEL.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.464
YEAH, LIKE A TUNNEL,
BUT IT WASN'T SCARY.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.833
YOU COULD SEE LIGHT
AT BOTH ENDS,

08:19.933 --> 08:24.371
LIKE WHERE THE TUNNEL
STARTED AND WHERE IT ENDED.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.473
I REMEMBER LOOKING
BACK AND FORTH,

08:26.574 --> 08:30.177
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH WAY WAS THE ENTRANCE
AND WHICH WAS THE EXIT.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.514
ANYTHING ELSE YOU
REMEMBER ABOUT IT?

08:39.653 --> 08:43.824
THE MAN WAS WEARING
SHOES LIKE YOURS.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.294
NOT THOSE SHOES.
THE BLACK ONES THAT
YOU USUALLY WEAR.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.262
LIKE MY OTHER ONES?

08:49.362 --> 08:53.233
NOT LIKE YOUR OTHER SHOES,
THEY WERE YOUR SHOES.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.204
SO THIS SERIAL KILLER
WAS WEARING MY-- MY SHOES?

08:59.039 --> 09:01.474
IT WAS YOU...

09:01.575 --> 09:03.476
IN THE HOTEL ROOM.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.246
YOU WERE WAITING
TO KILL MY FATHER.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.452
DID I TELL YOU WHY
I WAS GONNA KILL HIM?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.022
DID YOUR FATHER
EVER SHOW UP?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.924
NO.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.128
WE JUST SAT THERE.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.231
WE MADE SMALL TALK.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.601
AND THE WHOLE TIME
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET OUT OF THERE...

09:27.701 --> 09:29.870
TO CALL SOMEBODY
OR SOMETHING.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.574
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT
THIS SMALL TALK WAS ABOUT?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.376
I DON'T--

09:36.476 --> 09:39.747
I'M NOT SURE.
SOMETHING ABOUT...

09:41.048 --> 09:43.583
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE,
DOESN'T IT?

09:44.718 --> 09:47.420
YOU'RE ALWAYS INSINUATING
SHIT ABOUT HIM--

09:47.520 --> 09:50.157
THAT HE'S
THE MYSTERY MAN,

09:50.257 --> 09:51.959
THAT THERE'S
SOME BIG SECRET,

09:52.059 --> 09:54.762
THAT HE'S THE PERSON
WHO REALLY FUCKED ME UP.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.964
BUT THE JOKE'S ON YOU,
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

09:57.064 --> 10:00.801
MY FATHER
DIDN'T CROSS THE LINE
OR BREAK ANY RULES

10:00.901 --> 10:03.603
OR ANY OF THAT CRAP
YOU LOVE TO THROW AROUND.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.973
YOU'RE SO WRONG
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:09.176 --> 10:13.313
MY FATHER HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

10:13.413 --> 10:17.317
HIS WORK AND ME ARE
THE ONLY IMPORTANT THINGS
IN HIS LIFE.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.894
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT HIS PHOTOGRAPHS?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.664
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL...

10:30.764 --> 10:32.800
IF YOU LOOK AT THEM
WITH AN OPEN MIND,

10:32.900 --> 10:34.534
WHICH OF COURSE
YOU CAN'T.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.204
HE LOVES
THE HUMAN FORM.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.407
HE BELIEVES THE BODY
CAN BE THE PERFECT...

10:40.507 --> 10:42.575
EXPRESSION...

10:42.676 --> 10:45.713
OF EVERY HUMAN EMOTION
AND EXPERIENCE.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.917
IS THAT HOW HE SPEAKS
ABOUT HIS WORK?

10:50.017 --> 10:51.651
WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING, PAUL?

10:51.752 --> 10:55.222
THAT I CAN'T FORM AN OPINION
OF MY OWN FATHER'S WORK?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.025
YOU THINK
I'M QUOTING HIM?

10:58.125 --> 11:02.395
YOU KNOW, HE SAYS A LOT
OF SHRINKS ARE FAILED
ARTISTS OR WRITERS.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.499
MAYBE YOU'RE
JEALOUS OF HIM.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.535
HE TRAVELS
AROUND THE WORLD,

11:08.635 --> 11:10.470
HE WORKS WITH MODELS.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.440
MEANWHILE, YOU'RE
TRAPPED IN YOUR CELL
WITH FUCK-UPS LIKE ME.

11:13.540 --> 11:18.812
OH, I'D TAKE A FUCK-UP
LIKE YOU ANY DAY OVER ONE
OF THOSE SUPERMODELS.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.448
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.
SHUT UP.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.884
YES, I WOULD.
IT'S TRUE.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.454
SO, HOW WAS THAT
FOR YOU

11:27.554 --> 11:31.258
YOUR FATHER BEING CONSTANTLY
SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

11:31.358 --> 11:32.960
WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

11:33.060 --> 11:36.764
HE'S AN ARTIST.
IT WAS HIS JOB.

11:36.864 --> 11:40.167
BESIDES, NUDITY WAS
TOTALLY NORMAL IN MY HOUSE.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.969
I GOT USED TO IT.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.670
NUDITY?

11:43.771 --> 11:45.806
NUDE MODELS.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.975
THE FEMALE FORM.

11:48.075 --> 11:51.211
IT'S LIKE
DRAWING CLASS 101, PAUL.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.248
AN ARTIST MUST WORK
FROM THE PUREST INSPIRATION.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.716
HIS STUDIO WAS AT HOME

11:56.817 --> 12:00.487
SO THERE WERE
A LOT OF MODELS
WALKING AROUND NAKED.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.056
IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.
WE WERE COOL.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.225
SO THIS WAS
NORMAL FOR YOU,

12:05.325 --> 12:09.462
TO BE EXPOSED TO ADULTS
BEING NAKED, YEAH?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.031
"EXPOSED."

12:11.131 --> 12:13.400
"OOH, NUDITY.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.268
HOW SCARY.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.871
BREASTS-- TERRIFYING!"

12:21.174 --> 12:23.343
SO WERE YOU EVER NAKED
AROUND THE HOUSE?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.312
OF COURSE NOT.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.717
LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.986
YOU THINK THAT'S
MY BIG SECRET?

12:33.086 --> 12:36.623
I SAW MY FATHER NAKED
AND NOW I'M SCARRED FOR LIFE?

12:36.723 --> 12:39.026
ISN'T THAT KIND
OF A CLICHE?

12:39.126 --> 12:42.963
SO YOUR FATHER WAS NAKED
AND-- AND YOUR MOTHER AS WELL?

12:44.697 --> 12:46.066
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.435
MY MOTHER ALWAYS
WORE HER CLOTHES,

12:48.535 --> 12:50.303
EVEN IN THE SHOWER.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.039
( chuckles )

12:52.139 --> 12:56.209
BUT SHE WAS PERFECTLY
COMFORTABLE WITH THE--
THE MODELS?

12:56.309 --> 12:58.946
SHE WAS CLUELESS
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.214
SORRY, I'M HAVING
A DIFFICULT TIME
FOLLOWING THIS.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.417
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THAT PEOPLE WERE NAKED
ALL THE TIME?

13:04.517 --> 13:08.221
OKAY, NOT ALL THE TIME--

13:08.321 --> 13:10.090
A LOT OF THE TIME.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.493
DURING THE DAY,
WHILE MY MOTHER WAS AT WORK.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.799
SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT
YOUR FATHER WAS, UM...

13:19.900 --> 13:22.035
HIDING IT FROM HER?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.037
I'D SAY SHE WAS
A FUCKING IDIOT

13:24.137 --> 13:27.040
WHO COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.944
THEY WERE HAVING SEX.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.313
WHO-- WHO WAS
HAVING SEX, SOPHIE?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.350
MY DAD...

13:37.450 --> 13:40.287
WITH THE MODEL DU JOUR.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.022
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.292
I SAW THEM.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.429
I CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL
EARLY ONE DAY.

13:49.529 --> 13:53.867
THE MOM WHO DROVE
CARPOOL THAT DAY HAD
TO PICK US UP EARLY.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.869
I WALKED INTO
MY PARENTS' BEDROOM

13:55.969 --> 13:58.638
AND MY FATHER WAS
THERE WITH A MODEL.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.573
DOES YOUR FATHER KNOW
THAT YOU SAW?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.442
OH, YEAH.
HE GOT UP.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.845
HE CAME OVER TO ME
AND JUST LOOKED AT ME.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.581
I SAID SOMETHING LIKE,

14:08.681 --> 14:11.651
"I THOUGHT THE MODELS
ONLY CAME AT FIXED TIMES."

14:11.751 --> 14:13.987
AND WHAT DID HE SAY?

14:15.822 --> 14:17.857
I DON'T REMEMBER.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.193
SOMETHING LIKE,
"YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE AT SCHOOL."

14:20.293 --> 14:22.462
AND THEN
HE SHUT THE DOOR...

14:22.562 --> 14:24.031
AND LOCKED IT.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.666
I REMEMBER THE SOUND
OF THE LATCH SLIDING.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.168
HOW OLD WERE YOU?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.904
I DON'T KNOW.
SEVEN AND A HALF?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.974
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO DRAMATIC?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.742
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.111
MY FATHER IS AN ARTIST.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.148
THEY DON'T LIVE
LIKE OTHER PEOPLE DO.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.216
THEY HAVE TO
BE IN TOUCH WITH--

14:43.316 --> 14:46.653
THEY HAVE TO CRAP
ON CONVENTIONAL THINGS
IN ORDER TO CREATE.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.521
DID YOU TALK TO
YOUR MOTHER ABOUT THIS?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.090
NO.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.360
DID YOUR FATHER
TELL YOU NOT TO?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.862
NO.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.165
BUT YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM THE DOOR KNOWING THAT...

14:58.265 --> 15:01.168
YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO SAY ANYTHING,
THAT YOU HAD A SECRET.

15:03.971 --> 15:07.707
MAYBE THAT'S WHEN THE IDEA
OF TELEPATHY BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR DAD BEGAN?

15:07.807 --> 15:11.611
THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
WITHOUT WORDS.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.916
THAT'S YOUR BIG THEORY?

15:17.017 --> 15:20.820
AFTER ALL
YOUR INSINUATIONS?
PRETTY LAME.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.889
- YOU KEEP ACCUSING ME--
- YOU KEEP SUGGESTING

15:22.990 --> 15:25.325
THAT SOMEBODY CROSSED
THE LINE WITH ME,

15:25.425 --> 15:27.727
THAT I DON'T HAVE
THE ABILITY TO SAY "NO."

15:27.827 --> 15:30.097
YOU'RE SAYING THAT...

15:30.830 --> 15:32.299
WHAT?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.467
...THAT I'VE BEEN
SEXUALLY ABUSED.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.836
YOU THINK
THAT'S THE SECRET
I'M LOOKING FOR?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.338
WELL, AREN'T YOU?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.107
NO, I'M NOT.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.543
NO, RIGHT.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.984
DO YOU THINK SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO YOU?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.619
ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.988
I TOLD YOU
NOTHING HAPPENED.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.990
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KEEPS IMPLYING--

15:57.090 --> 15:59.792
I DON'T THINK YOU WERE
SEXUALLY ABUSED, SOPHIE.

15:59.892 --> 16:03.396
GOOD. THEN WE CAN
FINALLY STOP TALKING
ABOUT THAT.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.101
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
TELL YOUR MOTHER
WHAT YOU SAW?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.237
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

16:10.337 --> 16:14.241
SO THIS SECRET HAS
BEEN THERE BETWEEN YOU
AND SHE ALL THESE YEARS?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.543
SO WHAT? I BARELY SPEAK
TO THE WOMAN ANYWAY.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.412
AND YOU DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY CONNECTION
BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS?

16:19.512 --> 16:21.914
I DON'T SPEAK TO HER
BECAUSE SHE'S PATHETIC.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.616
SHE'S A MORON.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.653
SHE COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER FACE.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.259
SOMETIMES I THINK
SHE'S STILL WAITING FOR HIM,

16:32.359 --> 16:34.927
LIKE SANTA CLAUS
OR SOMETHING.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.964
SHE WOULD NEVER ADMIT IT,
BUT IT'S SO OBVIOUS,
IT'S PATHETIC.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.500
BUT IF YOU TOLD HER WHAT
YOU SAW, SHE MIGHT NOT BE
WAITING FOR HIM ANY LONGER.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.870
IT'S NOT MY JOB
TO MAKE HER FACE REALITY!

16:43.970 --> 16:47.440
I'M THE CHILD.
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE SMARTER THAN ME.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.809
YOU KNOW,
SHE SITS THERE,
DAY AFTER DAY,

16:49.909 --> 16:53.746
WAITING FOR HIM
TO COME TO HIS SENSES.
I WANT TO SCREAM AT HER,

16:53.846 --> 16:55.815
"HE DOESN'T GIVE
A FUCK ABOUT YOU!

16:55.915 --> 16:59.219
YOU'RE STUPID.
YOU'RE USELESS.
JUST GET THE FUCK UP

16:59.319 --> 17:01.421
OFF YOUR CLUELESS ASS
AND GET A LIFE!"

17:01.521 --> 17:03.556
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER
ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.058
IT'S NOT MY FUCKING JOB!

17:05.158 --> 17:07.560
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.563
MAYBE YOU WERE AFRAID
THAT THEY'D SEPARATE
AND IT WOULD BE YOUR FAULT,

17:10.663 --> 17:14.067
JUST LIKE YOU THOUGHT
THAT YOU'D RUINED CY
AND DARLENE'S MARRIAGE,

17:14.167 --> 17:15.702
REMEMBER THAT?

17:15.802 --> 17:20.307
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL YOUR MOTHER
AFTER THEY DIVORCED?

17:20.407 --> 17:23.176
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
RUB HER FACE IN IT?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.145
SO YOU'RE ANGRY BECAUSE
SHE COULDN'T SEE THAT?

17:25.245 --> 17:28.148
YES!
FUCK YES!

17:28.248 --> 17:30.383
SOPHIE, IN ALL THE WEEKS
THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THERAPY,

17:30.483 --> 17:33.052
YOU'VE NEVER
ONCE ALLOWED YOURSELF
TO BE ANGRY AT YOUR FATHER.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.156
IT'S NEVER EVEN BEEN
A POSSIBILITY FOR YOU.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.691
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

17:40.493 --> 17:43.263
SEE, I THINK THAT
YOUR FATHER MADE YOU
HIS ACCOMPLICE.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.032
HE BURDENED YOU
WITH THIS SECRET

17:46.133 --> 17:48.601
WAY TOO HEAVY
FOR ANY CHILD TO CARRY,

17:48.701 --> 17:52.239
AND HE DROVE THIS WEDGE
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOTHER
WITH THIS SECRET.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.307
MAYBE YOU'RE AFRAID
TO GET ANGRY AT HIM

17:54.407 --> 17:57.177
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,
YOU'D LOSE HIM FOR GOOD.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.146
AND MAYBE YOU NEVER
TOLD YOUR MOTHER

17:59.246 --> 18:01.047
BECAUSE PART
OF YOU STILL HOPES

18:01.148 --> 18:03.850
THAT THEY'RE GONNA
GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.556
I KNOW THAT'S NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.

18:09.656 --> 18:10.890
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.460
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BE AN IDIOT
TO BELIEVE THAT.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.995
I KNOW PLENTY
OF GROWNUPS

18:16.095 --> 18:17.997
WHOSE PARENTS HAVE
SEPARATED 20, 30 YEARS,

18:18.097 --> 18:21.834
WHO HAVE EVEN DIED--
AND THEY STILL HOPE
IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS

18:21.934 --> 18:25.838
THAT THEIR MOTHER
AND FATHER STILL SHARE
A BED IN HEAVEN.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.411
HE WOULDN'T BE
A GOOD HUSBAND
IF HE CAME BACK.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.580
HE'D JUST
LEAVE HER AGAIN.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.948
AND YOU.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.450
WHAT?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.553
HE LEFT YOU TOO,
DIDN'T HE?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.121
NO.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.857
HE JUST MOVED OUT.
HE'S STILL MY DAD.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.259
OF COURSE
HE'S STILL YOUR DAD,

18:46.359 --> 18:49.095
BUT HE DID LITERALLY
LEAVE YOU, DIDN'T HE?

18:49.196 --> 18:50.930
HE MOVED AWAY.
HE'S NOT AROUND.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.200
HE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE DEAD OR ALIVE.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.535
HE WAS WORKING.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.504
WHY CAN'T YOU LET YOURSELF
BE ANGRY AT HIM, SOPHIE?

18:57.604 --> 18:59.572
WHY SHOULD I BE
ANGRY AT HIM?

18:59.672 --> 19:02.141
SHE'S THE ONE WHO--

19:02.242 --> 19:04.277
WHO PISSES ME OFF.

19:04.377 --> 19:08.248
- WHY?
- BECAUSE SHE'S PATHETIC
AND ANNOYING AND...

19:08.348 --> 19:10.450
AND SHE'S ALWAYS AROUND.

19:14.954 --> 19:18.291
I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU MIGHT BE ANGRY
AT HER TOO, THOUGH.

19:18.391 --> 19:22.529
'CAUSE YOU FEEL THAT MAYBE
SHE DIDN'T PROTECT YOU FROM
WHAT WAS GOING ON AT HOME.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.733
BUT SHE'S ALSO A ROCK.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.869
SHE'S INCREDIBLY PATIENT.
SHE'S PERSISTENT.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.172
SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.809
SHE'S REALLY SOMETHING
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.612
ISN'T SHE?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.076
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.012
WHAT'S THAT?

20:13.112 --> 20:16.616
I'M NOT REALLY
THAT INTERESTED
IN GYMNASTICS ANYMORE.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.917
WHAT?

20:20.219 --> 20:23.956
- WHY NOT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.959
USED TO BE
EVERYTHING TO ME,

20:27.059 --> 20:29.629
AND NOW IT'S NOT.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.964
AND WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS, SOPHIE?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.334
NO, YOU TELL ME, PAUL.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.539
OKAY.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.276
I THINK THAT WHEN
YOU WERE GROWING UP,

20:43.376 --> 20:46.513
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH
BOUNDARIES AT HOME.

20:46.613 --> 20:51.217
BOUNDARIES TO
PROTECT A CHILD FROM--
WHAT WERE YOU, SIX, SEVEN?

20:51.318 --> 20:55.555
--FROM THINGS THAT
COULD IMPACT YOUR...

20:56.923 --> 20:59.225
YOUR VIEW OF SEX,

20:59.326 --> 21:00.527
YOUR BODY,

21:00.627 --> 21:02.595
YOUR ATTITUDES
TOWARD MEN.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.197
I THINK IT WAS ALSO
AN ENVIRONMENT

21:05.298 --> 21:08.835
WHERE YOU WERE
EXPECTED TO BE COMPLICIT
IN THE LIES OF GROWNUPS.

21:08.935 --> 21:13.205
AND I THINK YOU WANTED
TO ESCAPE, SO SPORTS BECAME
THE PERFECT OUTLET FOR YOU.

21:13.306 --> 21:18.110
A PLACE WITH RULES AND ORDER,
WHERE DISCIPLINE PROTECTED YOU

21:18.210 --> 21:20.780
AND-- AND GUIDED YOU.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.152
I THINK THAT GYMNASTICS
WAS ALWAYS A PLACE

21:26.252 --> 21:28.220
THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO RUN AWAY TO,

21:28.321 --> 21:30.823
TO BE IN CONTROL.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.928
MAYBE--

21:36.028 --> 21:41.067
MAYBE YOU DON'T
NEED TO RUN AWAY
TO THAT WORLD ANYMORE.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.146
SHIT.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.215
WHAT?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.918
I'LL NEVER MAKE
THE OLYMPIC TEAM NOW,

21:59.018 --> 22:02.489
NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE.

22:02.589 --> 22:06.859
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S NECESSARILY TRUE.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.230
I'M GONNA SUCK AT IT.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.632
( chuckles )

22:12.732 --> 22:14.634
HAVE YOU EVER
FAILED BEFORE?

22:14.734 --> 22:18.070
- NEVER, BUT...
- WHAT?

22:21.240 --> 22:24.644
...THE TIMES,
THEY ARE A'CHANGIN'.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.916
IT'S FROM A BOB DYLAN SONG.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.919
MY GIFT TO YOU.

22:33.820 --> 22:34.987
THANK YOU.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.458
YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.660
HE'S AN OLD GEEZER...
LIKE YOU.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.864
MMM, THANKS.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.413
OUR TIME IS UP.

23:51.397 --> 23:54.601
SO I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK THEN.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.803
OKAY?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.554
( acoustic guitar music
playing )
