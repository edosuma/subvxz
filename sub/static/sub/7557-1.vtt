18:00.400 --> 18:01.481
I'm sorry, ma'am.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.601
What happened?

18:02.680 --> 18:03.727
Don't touch me!

18:03.800 --> 18:05.006
You don't even deserve

18:05.080 --> 18:07.162
to look at my child's body
laying right on this ground!

18:07.240 --> 18:08.241
None of you.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.610
You gonna get your day, Lysistrata.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.650
You and your damn boyfriend.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.327
You got what's coming for you.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.210
I want you to look at her,
look at her right there.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.881
That's a seven... A little baby!

18:26.080 --> 18:27.241
A baby.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.127
A baby.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.765
I can't take this anymore.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.641
Your daughter is in heaven.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.971
It could be you, next time. Will you
be standin' around lookin' then?

19:11.320 --> 19:12.810
This "Nuthin" ' has no where to go.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.241
Welcome to my home.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.483
Come on in. Come on.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.360
HELEN: Why don't you move in
with that boy of yours?

19:29.640 --> 19:31.085
Machine Gun Kelly?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.401
Wouldn't be safe.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.131
I suppose he'll be gunnin'
for who set that fire.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.364
Y'all make my tired ass tired.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.809
There are children here in Englewood!
Does that mean anything to you?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.283
Runnin' up the street.
Shootin' and killin'.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.130
Do you care at all?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.162
- Maybe I should leave.
- No. Sit.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.201
Sta)'-

19:55.880 --> 19:57.882
You're gonna deal with this today.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.883
- You don't have any family?
- No, ma'am.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.561
I'm an orphan.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.161
My moma put me up for
adoption at birth.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.721
I grew up moving from
one Group Home to another.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.769
Lord, help you, child.

20:25.360 --> 20:26.566
Where's your flatscreen?

20:27.800 --> 20:29.290
Malcom X once said,

20:29.360 --> 20:31.761
"The best way to hide something
from negros,"

20:32.240 --> 20:33.605
"is to put it in a book."

20:34.840 --> 20:37.081
Well, I can dig it, Miss Helen.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.011
You sure got mad books.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.406
Books are my life.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.401
My life are books.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.409
- You always lived here?
- No.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.765
I lived in Cabrini Green
back when it was clean,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.445
before they knocked it down.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.644
Oh, lot of black folk
got gentrified across town.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.450
- Who's this?
- My daughter.

20:56.920 --> 20:57.921
Pam.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.001
Let me guess.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.525
- Ten?
- That's right.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.844
HELEN: Fifth grade, class picture.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.721
[GUNSHOT]
Girl, come away from that window!

21:07.640 --> 21:08.641
Chi-Raq.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.246
Chi-Raq.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.240
I hate that name.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.521
It's not who we are.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.571
Chicago has always been
a straight-up gangster town.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.446
- We are not Chi-Raqs.
- What do you call all these shootings?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.650
Crime, doing time.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.484
It's not just about Chicago.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.604
What about Bodymore Murderland?

21:32.920 --> 21:33.921
Killadelphia.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.924
City of brotherly murder.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.889
Bucktown. Brooklyn, New York.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.766
So many people getting shot,
hospitals goin' broke!

21:41.160 --> 21:43.766
I mean, you got to get on the E-way,
people dying enroute.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.604
They can't even file a lawsuit.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.684
I mean, there ain't no trauma centers
here on the Southside.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.240
There was a time in summer
when it got hot,

21:51.400 --> 21:54.688
your child could go outside and play
and not get shot.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.962
- Well, I don't remember that time.
- It existed.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.964
I'm sorry, Miss Helen,
but it's a war zone here.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.811
The US spends money
on the Iraqi people,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.163
to train them, govern them,
helped them build an economy.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.691
Billions and billions in dollars.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.525
The Afghan people too.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.969
They don't do economic development
like that here on Southside.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.970
See, Americans like war.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.085
They like guns.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.721
Fun and games.

22:19.800 --> 22:20.801
Fun and games?

22:20.920 --> 22:23.002
Ask the parents at Sandy Hook.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.925
When they murdered white babies
and things don't change.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.971
Saving black life is way out of range.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.166
I keep thinking of that mother
that lost her child.

22:32.360 --> 22:33.361
You should.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.244
This boy, you with?

22:37.480 --> 22:38.641
- Chi-Raq?
- What?

22:38.760 --> 22:39.807
That's what they call him.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.050
Wait a minute now. Hold on.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.570
They call him Chi-Raq?

22:44.960 --> 22:46.007
Yes, ma'am.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.642
Lord, have mercy.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.120
Well, he's a rapper.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.245
I mean, he's gonna be big time famous.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.646
You really never heard of him?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.849
I heard he was the leader
in this gang mess, girl.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.566
Oh, Miss Helen,
they don't say "gang" anymore.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.201
They say organization.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.890
What is his real name?

23:05.040 --> 23:06.371
His government name?

23:07.360 --> 23:08.361
Nah.

23:10.840 --> 23:11.841
Demetrius.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.446
Demetrius DuPree.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.808
Demetrius DuPree.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.041
His father?

23:20.600 --> 23:23.001
All Chi's told me
is that he died in prison.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.248
He's got a good heart
deep down inside.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.281
I love him.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.762
- I can change Chi.
- Darling.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.890
People change
when they decide to change.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.770
You make it sound so easy.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.850
All you can do
is create an environment for change.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.730
Like an alcoholic,
you take away his booze.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.326
You just try taking away their guns.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.801
All right.
Well, what else do they love?

23:59.640 --> 24:02.928
- Getting turned up, making money.
- What else?

24:08.160 --> 24:09.810
[CHUCKLING] Yeah, Well.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.041
Pick up your phone.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.850

that helped bring an end

24:29.480 --> 24:32.802

in 2003.

- Burn, baby, burn.

- And I lost my little brother.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.721

Many a sister and brother.

Now, I'd like to see
Cyclops and Chi put down that mess

29:35.400 --> 29:38.244
between the Trojan and the Greeks,
but that day looks bleak.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.125
What if we could devise a method
to end the bloodshed?

29:41.360 --> 29:43.203
Yo count on me. You need money?

29:43.280 --> 29:46.443
I'll pawn all the gold around my neck,

up the middle, to give you half.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.682
I'm down for the cause but how?

29:53.040 --> 29:55.725
We force our men to negotiate peace

29:56.000 --> 29:58.731
by exercising cocksure self control

29:58.800 --> 30:01.770
and total abstinence
from knockin' the boots.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.491
I never did like you Trojan
chicken heads any-goddamn-way so...

30:09.560 --> 30:11.608

- You got to get out of here.

- Yeah, out of here.

- Shoot 'em up.
- Bang, bang.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.331

30:26.720 --> 30:29.530
Just a minute ago, you were ready
to split yourself up the middle.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.008
Go ahead so that
you Spartans can get out of here.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.288
I just saw a mother weepin'
in the streets.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.488
Her baby's blood spilt.

30:43.840 --> 30:46.286
Man, you really think
somethin' like that could bring peace?

30:46.400 --> 30:49.449
Y'all know the power we have over them
withholding with just a day.

30:51.160 --> 30:54.084
A week? Imagine a month.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.890
A year.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.966
They are gonna bring the peace.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.243
Suppose, suppose
that the men just dump us.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.687
If we all hold out,
who can they go to?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.120
The thots!

31:06.360 --> 31:07.600
Dem hoes o'er there.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.842
Well, we will enlist them too.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.327
We want our men alive,
we want our babies to thrive,

31:12.680 --> 31:14.170
we gonna have to organize.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.681
Repeat after me.

31:20.160 --> 31:26.008
I will deny all rights of access
or entrance...

31:27.440 --> 31:30.967
I will deny all rights

Come on, say it.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.608
Girl, can't cheat us.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.968
I can't do this. No.

32:02.040 --> 32:06.250
If he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

32:06.920 --> 32:11.721
if he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

32:12.040 --> 32:17.251
I will refuse his strokin',
not give up that nappy pouch.

32:18.240 --> 32:24.407
I will refuse his stroke,
not give up that nappy pouch.

32:24.520 --> 32:27.922
- No peace...
- No pussy.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.291
The red wine has been drunk,
the plan has now struck.

32:35.960 --> 32:39.851
Dolmedes must tell you fellas,
y'all about to get punked.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.763
Lysistrata had them all
take a solemn oath,

32:44.360 --> 32:47.967
"Stop the murder madness,
or there would be no more pokes.”."

32:48.640 --> 32:51.086
Some even thought the shit was hoax.

32:51.520 --> 32:55.081
How could dem females give up
long dick and da down stroke?

32:55.520 --> 32:57.602
This must be some bullshit.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.405
Ain't no fucking way.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.609
But y'all about to find out

33:02.280 --> 33:03.805

33:04.600 --> 33:07.968
No more punane, nookiepie,
beehive or honeybun.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.370
No coochie, no nappy dugout.
That's right.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.001
You get none.

33:13.760 --> 33:14.921
Say what?

33:15.960 --> 33:18.080
CHI-RAQ: To be so smart,
y'know you're tweakin' right?

33:18.120 --> 33:21.283
You Lame as Hell, playin' games for
real wit' dis whack-ass panty strike.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.885
And that's the shit we don't like.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.121
You want to choose to be ruled,

33:24.200 --> 33:26.168
bitches gonna be tight
when you make they lose their dudes.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.009
I dunno who you think
you're tryin' to change.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.050
I'm Trojan through and through,
that's stronger than any damn screw.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.360
It' even bigger than you.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.523
All you care about
is this tired gangster game.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.411
Well, it's lame.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.249
You think you'll die with fame?

33:39.400 --> 33:42.882
Negro, two days later
no one will even remember your name.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.568
Your machismo's really masochism.
That's why we cuttin' off da jism!

33:46.720 --> 33:48.882
As long as you love the life
more than a wife,

33:49.040 --> 33:50.121
we strike.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.806
Why you so frigid?

33:54.200 --> 33:56.009
Baby, let me thaw you out
with this ice-pick.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.204
Know you can't resist
the chocolate lick.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.047
Chill out.

34:00.280 --> 34:03.329
This next move is the best move
and it's gonna be smooth...

34:04.560 --> 34:06.562
Fine. Remember that

34:08.600 --> 34:10.489

34:10.560 --> 34:12.483
But the Line Broke!
Them Bitches Choked!

34:12.560 --> 34:14.641
And Lysistrata
and her "Former" "Friends"

34:14.920 --> 34:16.888
got replaced by some tighter pokes.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.527
Bye.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.360
- Be...
- Safe.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.089
What's happenin'
with the jump off bacchos?

34:38.159 --> 34:39.810
We got the cheese, where's the nachos?

34:39.880 --> 34:41.643
Why you got the club on lock, yo?

34:41.719 --> 34:43.688
- It's rough up in here.
- It's saturday night.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.563
- We gettin' tight?
- Not tonight.

34:45.639 --> 34:48.643
Ain't No partyin'.
No dancin'. No gettin' down!

34:48.719 --> 34:50.882
- Why?
- Ain't a broad to be had!

34:51.000 --> 34:53.924
Just a bunch of hardheads goin' stag.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.363
What the hell?

35:11.200 --> 35:12.884
I'll be god-damned.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.330
What the hell?

35:20.080 --> 35:20.580
Shit...

35:33.400 --> 35:36.210
All right, peep this,
I got 30 girls strippin' for me

35:36.320 --> 35:39.642
another five on loan. And none of em',

35:39.720 --> 35:41.688
is answering the god damn phone.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.886
That shit is wack!

35:42.960 --> 35:46.521
Yeah man, at this time of night
the champagne room be full of life!

35:46.800 --> 35:51.010
Young boys puttin' dollar bills in
the drawers of all my pretty thrills!

35:51.600 --> 35:54.729
Cyclops, we have
been struck by a plague

35:54.840 --> 35:58.322
that will put that Biblical pestilence
shit to shame!

35:58.440 --> 36:01.011
And this famine affects
only the lower regions, where all you

36:01.120 --> 36:03.202
young Trojans
do most of your thinkin'!

36:03.320 --> 36:05.000
I mean, this is the male side
of the aisle,

36:05.040 --> 36:06.724
if you can't squeeze it,

36:06.840 --> 36:10.561
you at least wanna tease it.

36:14.720 --> 36:20.045
But these ho's have literally
shut down the penis power grid!

36:20.160 --> 36:21.889
So my questions to y'all...

36:22.440 --> 36:25.284
ls what you muthafuckas done did?

36:26.120 --> 36:27.770
The situation's out of control,

36:27.840 --> 36:30.161
'cause I'm in front
of an empty stripper pole.

36:30.240 --> 36:34.006

so you know, your pole is gold.

36:41.640 --> 36:44.291
Yeah, we got you, Morris.
Don't worry about this, I got this.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.602
Got it between my crosshairs.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.250
What you need is another eye.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.649
There's not even
half an ass to look at.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.520
One of these days you're gonna get
tired of them one-eyed jokes.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.250
Sorry man, I'm a little uptight,

36:58.400 --> 37:00.129
'cause there ain't no pussy
in the club tonight!

37:00.200 --> 37:02.646
- Where's yours on standby?
- I can't sell standby.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.487
I need some active duty,
first class vagina!

37:06.560 --> 37:08.961
You need active duty booty.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.608
Damn, that shit just come to me,
I don't know how.

37:18.080 --> 37:21.562
You know what, man. I would like
to have somebody on that pole tonight.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.445
Beast. Pole, baby.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.960
It's not that kinda club, young man.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.646
What kind of insubordination
is this shit?

37:29.720 --> 37:31.688
- No. We got it, Boss.
- You need all you can get!

37:31.760 --> 37:33.524
Relax. I got this.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.080
- Do it, son. Yeah, do that shit.
- Spin!

37:39.960 --> 37:41.530
Hey Big Thelma, where you goin'?

37:41.600 --> 37:44.809
To The US Virgin Islands,
a place my girls ain't never seen.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.086
Where you girls be at?

37:46.240 --> 37:49.369
My bitches told me to go,
say they're honorin' the strike,

37:49.440 --> 37:50.680
said they don't care who likes.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.529
- A ho strike?
- Shit yeah.

40:56.800 --> 41:01.681
An important life in our community.

41:04.640 --> 41:10.807
A life that ends life.

41:14.080 --> 41:18.369
The life of a gun.

41:28.440 --> 41:32.365
This gun began its professional career

41:32.440 --> 41:36.365
when it was purchased
by "Tiny Tony" from Chicago.

41:36.840 --> 41:38.842
At an Indiana Gun Show,

41:40.120 --> 41:42.646
using a fake Indiana ID.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.767
And bypassed all of our
strict gun laws.

41:51.240 --> 41:54.847
Chicago gangs buy the guns

41:56.240 --> 41:57.480
for big money.

42:01.920 --> 42:06.005
For their work
in the Underground Economy.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.611
WOMAN: Tell the truth!

42:09.920 --> 42:12.400
The Underground Economy exists

42:12.600 --> 42:16.605
because banks and lending institutions

42:16.720 --> 42:18.961
rarely loan money to poor people.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.166
Is that right?

42:23.480 --> 42:26.768

however admire the thug life.

of suburban Chicago!

42:34.000 --> 42:36.844
Kenilworth, Wilmette, Highland Park.

42:36.920 --> 42:41.164
No, this gun wouldn't
be caught dead there!

42:41.280 --> 42:46.446
This gun is the principal player
in a reality TV urban murder show,

42:46.520 --> 42:50.081
that can be seen every night
at five and ten.

42:50.160 --> 42:53.926
Every channel! On any news show
you want to watch!

42:55.240 --> 42:56.844
And that's when this gun...

43:00.360 --> 43:03.250
Met our child Patti.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.206
Patti.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.970
Patti is gone

43:15.480 --> 43:20.202
because our politicians
are in the pocket

43:20.320 --> 43:23.881
of the National Rifle Association.

43:24.240 --> 43:30.168
And have become their mouthpieces
or silent co-conspirators.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.129
[APPLAUSE]

43:32.520 --> 43:34.284
Patti is gone

43:35.280 --> 43:39.001
because of an economy
that has abandoned the poor.

43:39.880 --> 43:43.168
Downtown they say unemployment
is at 5.7%...

43:44.600 --> 43:45.647
How's that sound?

43:46.120 --> 43:49.488
Right here in Auburn-Gresham,
unemployment is 21%.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.883
And that doesn't even count people
who have given up hope

43:53.040 --> 43:54.963
and stopped looking for work.

43:55.520 --> 43:59.525
The per capita income is $12,000.

43:59.800 --> 44:03.327
42% of us live below the poverty line.

44:03.880 --> 44:06.645
30% don't have a high school diploma.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.690
- What America are they living in?
- Yes!

44:11.160 --> 44:13.970
We go from third rate schools,

to first class, high tech prison!

44:29.080 --> 44:30.764
Our Patti is gone

44:32.520 --> 44:36.206
because gang members
are more concerned

44:36.480 --> 44:38.881
with popping pills
and popping bottles.

44:38.960 --> 44:41.611
More concerned with what's on YouTube!

44:42.560 --> 44:44.801
More concerned with ego!

44:44.960 --> 44:49.249
Street cred and greed
than a human life.

44:52.080 --> 44:56.768
Patti is gone because guns have become
a part of America's wardrobe,

44:58.160 --> 45:01.926
where it's easier to get a gun
than a computer.

45:05.840 --> 45:09.003
Sirens and gunshots

45:10.520 --> 45:12.124
are our soundtrack.

45:15.760 --> 45:20.402
Yellow police tape, teddy bears,
T-shirts, balloons,

45:20.480 --> 45:23.882
these are the national memorials
of our neighborhoods.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.250
And it doesn't look good.

MAN: Take your time.

45:39.280 --> 45:43.285
[APPLAUSE]

45:43.920 --> 45:45.081
It didn't look good.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.090
When the sky turned dark.

45:51.400 --> 45:53.129
And the sun refused to shine.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.168
And the earth began to quake.

45:57.680 --> 46:01.810
And they laid Jesus' lifeless body
at the arms of Mother Mary!

46:03.760 --> 46:06.286
And I don't need to go back
to Biblical times.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.567
It didn't look good
in a Birmingham church

46:08.760 --> 46:11.570
when four little girls
were blown apart by hate!

46:11.680 --> 46:12.727
It didn't look good,

46:12.800 --> 46:15.485
when Medgar was laying
bleeding to death in his driveway.

46:15.600 --> 46:19.241
It didn't look good, when Malcolm
was shot down on the Audubon stage.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.687
And didn't look good,
when Martin Luther King

46:21.760 --> 46:26.402
stood on the balcony of
the Lorraine Motel outside Room 306,

witness has come forward?

and the conscience to speak up

a target is not the shooter.

a target is the community

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.848
Why the fuck y'all
got me on full blast?

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.649
Why y'all trying' to put me on
front street?

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.926
This is my Pam,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.729
she's ten years old

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.086
I don't wanna hear that shit...

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.889
Chi, please!

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.049
One summer day,

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.371
back when we lived in
The Cabrini Green Projects,

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:53.890
Pam was outside...

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:57.649
jumping double dutch
when they started shooting.

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.286
She was shot through her left eye

01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:04.329
by a stray bullet.

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:07.327
This was over twenty years ago

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:10.808
and children dying from stray bullets

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:14.169
wasn't a common occurrence like it is
today.

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:20.010
Days later a young man
came to my apartment.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.680
He begged my forgiveness,

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.843
then he confessed to the police.

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.929
Back then,

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:33.408
it was a violation of the gang code

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.967
to murder children.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.091
He knew...

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:44.165
He knew

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:47.088
that if he didn't confess
to me and the police

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:48.525
that the gangs

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.850
would end his life.

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.243
And that man was your father.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:58.841
Jamel.

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.449
Never knew him.

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.722
Only heard stories.

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:20.561
He got killed in prison
when I was just a shorty.

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.847
He tried to be a good man.

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.771
You can be a good man.

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.003
Be a good man.

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:43.609
Be a good man...

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:48.969
Be a good man...

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.891
Be a good man...

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.411
Be a good man...

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.043
Be a good man...

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.280
I did dirt.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.731
You have something you want to say?

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.644
[SOBBING]

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.486
I killed your Baby Patti.

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.610
It was an accident.

01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:57.166
No!

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.843
[SCREAMING]

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:27.364
Pray for me. Please...

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.841
What y'all looking at?

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:33.446
Time for you to do the same.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.607
Take the blame. Take the claim.

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:38.762
Take it on the chin
and confess your sin.

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.246
Be a man and quit trying to suppress
this pain you in.

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:44.807
Hell of a mess this gang you in.

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:46.960
Sleepless nights!

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.207
Too weak to fight,
couldn't reach us to teach us right.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:53.161
Our crying mothers,
our dying brothers.

01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:55.085
D and D,
that's what they want us to be,

01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:56.241
Deaf and dumb.

01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:59.326
But you see, the only ones we
protecting is the gun.

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:02.331
So run, nigga, run,
I let it run outta me.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.962
Cause I'm finally free from all these
demons.

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:08.051
Finally I'm leaving!
Finally I'm breathing!

01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.408
So bring the truth! Bring the truth!

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:14.050
Bring the truth, brother! Bring it!

01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:27.450
He'll be all right.
Chi-Raq can take care of himself.

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:30.084
That's Demetrius.

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.044
That's not Chi-Raq.

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:33.971
[BELL TOLLS]

01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:37.482

[BELL TOLLS]

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:54.569
As Stevie Wonder sings.

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.521
"All In Love ls Fair."

01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.891
I ain't too sure about that
but for now,

01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:02.730
I'll say yeah!

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:07.010
Lysistrata formed an army more
powerful than the Roman Empire.

01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:09.449
Burned through the city,

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.409
just like that Chicago fire.

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.169
So remember,
Queen Prophet, Lysistrata.

01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.404
And the lessons that she taught you.

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:23.446
The only real security is love, y'all.

01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:31.605
Let's all together make Chi-Raq

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.123
back into Chicago,

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:37.127
City of the Broad Shoulders.

01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:42.481
Peace, two fingers.
