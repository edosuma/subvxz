Wait. We're actually...
we're good with-- we're good with half.

10:25.958 --> 10:26.959

-Sterling, Blair.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.011
Wow.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.305
Y'all track skips around here a lot?

10:39.388 --> 10:42.516
[clears throat] Yeah. Yeah,
here and there. Yeah, sometimes--

10:42.600 --> 10:44.143
sometimes here
and other times, there.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.144
What about you?

10:45.478 --> 10:46.395
I'm new to Atlanta,

10:46.479 --> 10:48.731
but I've been bounty huntin'
just shy of ten year.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.608
Oh, yeah, we're bounty hunters, too.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.234
That I gathered.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.278
And also, she got laid today.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.281
Oh, nice.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.700
Like, full repetitive penetration.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.243
Congratulations.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.412
-[both] Eww.
-Jesus.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.665
But yeah, she did
and I'm really proud of her.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.832
Oh, my God. Thank you.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.398
that my amazing daddy

12:13.482 --> 12:15.609
let me and my squad

12:15.693 --> 12:20.322
use his helicopter
to hop up to our lake house

12:20.406 --> 12:22.867
for a discipleship weekend.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.369
We had such a productive time

12:25.453 --> 12:30.166
in quiet worship and, of course,
doing acts of service.

12:30.249 --> 12:35.296
We knitted sweaters for the sick,
dirty babies with tiny heads in Brazil.

12:35.379 --> 12:39.633
Sweaters filled
with Christ's infinite love.

12:51.729 --> 12:55.608
My spirit is so heavy
for those pequito niños.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.526
Hmm.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.278
That's a great slide show, April.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.280
Yes, friends.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.240
Okay, but we do need to move on.

13:04.074 --> 13:07.203
Listen, everybody,
we had some excellent submissions

13:07.286 --> 13:09.205
for this year's Fellowship student leader.

through Christ."

13:19.715 --> 13:22.009
Yes. Oh, yes, we will do that.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.469
Okay, but like I was saying, guys,

13:23.552 --> 13:25.930
we had a lot of great candidates,

13:26.347 --> 13:28.933
but this year, I choose the individual

13:29.099 --> 13:34.480
who earnestly represents
Jesus' path on this Earth, right?

13:35.064 --> 13:37.191
I mean, this young woman

13:37.525 --> 13:40.861
makes Christ proud every single day.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.322
So when you guys are struggling, right?

13:43.405 --> 13:46.784
And you're struggling
on your path with the Lord,

13:46.867 --> 13:50.037
I want you to look to her
for guidance, okay?

13:50.579 --> 13:54.583
This year's
Fellowship student leader is...

I wasn't expecting this.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.021
What an honor. Um...

14:16.105 --> 14:20.442
I'm really looking forward
to this responsibility

14:20.526 --> 14:24.613
of helping guide you guys
on your faith journeys.

Oh, um...

14:28.284 --> 14:29.159
I...

14:29.743 --> 14:33.497

feeling God's presence in my life

14:33.581 --> 14:35.457
more so than ever before,

14:35.541 --> 14:39.044

to working with you this year.

We are going to have so much fun!

15:27.885 --> 15:31.513
And I just know you'll bring something
extra special to this position, huh?

15:31.597 --> 15:32.765
Thanks, Ellen. It's an honor.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.849
Oh, I know it is.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.018
Okay. Well, we got the lock-in coming up.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.103
So, I'll need your full attention on that.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.272
And then why don't we just
plan to meet sometime soon

15:40.356 --> 15:42.107
and discuss next week's
devotional reading.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.192
-Okay.
-It's always good

to start the year off with abstinence.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.572

is that right?

15:55.162 --> 15:59.959
Yeah. I heard that he saw Nine Inch Nails
20 times on the Downward Spiral tour.

Wow.

I love you girls.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.426
Text me if you need me.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.763
I can't be Fellowship leader.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.474
What, why? It's, like, your whole thing.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.143
I can't lead a Christian Community
if I've... you know?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.354
Had sex with your long-term boyfriend?

16:20.437 --> 16:22.356
-Who cares?
-Everyone cares.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.442
But what I mean is,
do you think you did anything wrong?

16:26.318 --> 16:28.320
Not any more wrong than it was wrong

16:28.404 --> 16:30.364
that I lied about farting in the car
this morning.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.532
A sin's a sin. You know?

16:31.615 --> 16:34.243
If you repent, then you're forgiven
in the eyes of the Lord, so...

16:34.785 --> 16:36.578
Right, so what's the issue?

16:37.746 --> 16:38.747
I feel like a liar.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.000
If Ellen knew I was sexually active,

16:41.083 --> 16:42.668
then forget student leader,

16:42.751 --> 16:44.628
she'd kick me out
of Fellowship altogether.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.799
So, you're either an honest slut
or a lying slut?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.510
-Yeah.
-Hey, at least with Fellowship,

16:51.593 --> 16:53.929
you have something impressive
to put on your college apps.

17:25.919 --> 17:26.962
but I'm glad it wasn't

and Luke at all?

She's gonna tell
the whole fricking school.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.819
She can't prove anything.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.903
Does she have to?

18:33.320 --> 18:36.281

You want to look your best.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.478
Oh, great point, Mom.

to a successful career in sports.

back in high school.

Did I mention that I killed it today
in lax practice, like a total badass?

-Language. Bad.
-But--

19:40.470 --> 19:42.347
That is fantastic, Blair. What'd you do?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.433
Did you give those attackers
the old "Wesley check"?

-Yes, sir. You know it.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.028
Okay, just texted Bowser
that we're on our way.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.865
Honestly, Blair, is there not another way
we could get the money?

20:00.616 --> 20:03.535
Is prostitution legal
in the state of Georgia

20:03.619 --> 20:05.245
if the prostitute is super into it?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.330
I'm serious.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.081
Okay, we're going to pick up the 2,500,

20:08.165 --> 20:10.500
get Dad's truck fixed before the weekend,

20:10.584 --> 20:12.127
and then never think about this again.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.379

21:04.596 --> 21:05.889
Okay, we're not on a ship.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.141
Just let her be happy, Bowser.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.142
Just let her be happy.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.561
Is this your "job" job?
I thought you were a bounty-hunter.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.480
Can I have a vanilla
with extra gummy bears?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.650
Wait. You.
Don't knock my side-hustle, kid.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.360
Trust me. You never know.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.529
And yes, you can have extra gummy bears,

21:20.612 --> 21:21.822
that'll be an extra 75 cents.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.031
Do you sing if I tip?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.616
No, I will not sing.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.910
[Blair] You're no fun.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.331
-What is--?
-Hey! What you waitin' on?

21:32.207 --> 21:33.041
Come on.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.217
You, uh... got the cash?

21:42.426 --> 21:43.260
Yup.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.056
Turn around, please.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.266
Thank you.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.351
All right.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.359
-[ringtone on cell phone]
-Oh, shit.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.030
Yeah. Go for Bowser.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.991
No. No. No. No. Yolanda.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.951
Don't give it to that bitch-ass, Terrance.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.286
I'll find him.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.247
I know.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.333
The Men's Parlor. I know.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.126
Because I'll find--

22:16.501 --> 22:18.295
You heard what I said, didn't you?

22:18.378 --> 22:19.338
[whispering] Shit.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.798
Hey. Put that back.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.133
What are you doing? Here you go.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.095
Count it, Sterling. [clears throat]

22:28.096 --> 22:29.598
Yep, 2,500.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.558
-That's great. Thank you. It's good.
-All right.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.851
Good doing business with you.

22:32.934 --> 22:33.935
[grunts]

22:35.228 --> 22:38.231
-As the old saying goes, "Bye."
-Uh...

22:39.524 --> 22:40.525
Hey, Bowser.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.526
Yeah.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.652
Uh...

22:42.736 --> 22:44.946
You look... manly.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.948
Oily... Uh...

22:47.032 --> 22:48.617
Vehicular-ly inclined.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.745
Anyway, do you know
how much it might cost us

22:51.828 --> 22:53.455
to get that fixed? Roughly?

22:54.247 --> 22:55.624
Oily, huh? Yeah.

22:56.333 --> 23:00.212
Well, as a man who's crashed many cars,

23:01.004 --> 23:04.591
I'd say you'd probably run yourself
about 5K worth of damage here.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.302
Yeah.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.013
Um... Do you have any more jobs?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.765
Ah, jeez, if I had any more jobs,

23:12.432 --> 23:14.142
if I had more jobs-- Look...

23:15.227 --> 23:17.062
I like you girls. I do.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.189
You're fast as hell.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.400
You run like a deer. It was amazing.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.652
And you, you're a freakishly good shot.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.153
But I've got rent to pay.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.281
I can't split my rewards
on folks I can nab on my own, see?

23:28.365 --> 23:30.409
Hey, we get it.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.537
Yeah, well,
getting it is half the battle, ah?

23:34.079 --> 23:35.372
So, what do you want to do now?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.957
Go to the Men's Parlor?

23:37.040 --> 23:40.585
That secret club of which
we know the exact location?

23:41.294 --> 23:43.463
Hey, uh, what's the address over there?

23:43.547 --> 23:45.132
The address alone
won't get you very far.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.092
-And why is that?
-You need us to get in it.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.635
It-- um-- It's in this country club

23:48.718 --> 23:51.721
and they only cater to
this specific clientele, it's--

23:52.305 --> 23:53.306
-White people.
-Blair.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.266
What? It's true!

23:54.433 --> 23:56.560
I don't think
it's written in stone, but...

23:57.477 --> 23:59.229
actually, it--it might be.

23:59.813 --> 24:03.692
So, unfortunately these places
have some outdated policies that don't--

24:03.775 --> 24:07.320
Okay. Enough with the Black history,
Reverend Al Sharpton. I get it.

24:07.571 --> 24:08.447
They're racist.

24:08.905 --> 24:09.865
-Right.
-Yes.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.326
Yeah, so you can have the address for,

24:13.660 --> 24:15.454
I don't know, say... a hundred,

24:16.329 --> 24:20.500
or you could have personal whitey escorts

24:21.501 --> 24:23.170
-for three thou--
-Five.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.213
Five thousand dollars.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.591
If you deliver me John Stevens,

24:28.300 --> 24:29.634
y'all will get paid.

24:31.595 --> 24:32.929
John Stevens, dude.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.640
It can't be April's dad. There's gotta
be a bajillion John Stevenses.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.809
Bajillion John Stevenses
that belong to Men's Parlor?

24:38.185 --> 24:40.854
April's dad is the creep
on our eighth grade trip to Jekyll Island

24:40.937 --> 24:43.023
that said I was developing nicely.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.107
Oh, barf. Yes.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.318
I'd love to arrest him
and watch April squirm.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.779
Are you wearing my Savage X Fenty
bralette again?

24:49.863 --> 24:52.032
I hate you. You'll stink it up
with your smelly boobs.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.158
Now's not the time.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.453
Cool. We know John Stevens.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.371
Say again.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.540
Oh, yeah, we brought him in before.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.667
What did the old boy do this time?

25:04.878 --> 25:06.379
Solicitation and battery.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.340
Real pillar of his community.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.133
Skipped bail last week, even.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.011
Having a meeting tonight
at The Men's Parlor at 6:00.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.764
My bail bondsman. My bail bondswoman...

25:15.847 --> 25:18.350
My bail bondsperson got a tip.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.101
Dope.

25:20.810 --> 25:21.686
Let's ride.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.524
-Dope. Let's ride.
-Hey! My car.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.199
[tires screech]

25:39.037 --> 25:40.622
Well, this is some Django shit.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.874
Hey, Trevor. Hey, Miles.

25:42.958 --> 25:43.875
Hey, Miss Wesley.

25:45.043 --> 25:45.919
Miss Wesley.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.255
Hey, Miles.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.633
Oh, uh,
you guys going to be parking today?

25:51.716 --> 25:52.968
No. He's just dropping us off.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.057
Park down by the service entrance,

25:59.140 --> 26:01.059
download Fruit Ninja.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.228
We'll be back with your guy.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.855
What the hell is a "fruit ninja"?

26:08.233 --> 26:09.985
I'm really hoping you have a plan.

26:10.068 --> 26:15.240
Not so much a plan as like a general
idea...ish...ment.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.408
Care to enlighten me?

26:16.491 --> 26:17.492
Okay, how about...

26:18.493 --> 26:20.996
we walk into The Men's Parlor
like a couple of Lara Crofts.

26:21.454 --> 26:24.958
And then we slip some of my melatonin
into Mr. Stevens' drink,

26:25.041 --> 26:26.751
like James Bond and then we grab him--

26:26.835 --> 26:28.753
Or we can clock him in the head
with this pistol?

26:28.837 --> 26:29.754
You brought a pistol?

26:29.838 --> 26:30.880
[woman] Hello, girls...

26:30.964 --> 26:33.592
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Jenson.
Y'all are looking sharp.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.509
Thank you.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.261
I love that nail color, Mrs. Jenson.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.430
It's like skin color, but prettier.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.724
Y'all are too dang sweet.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.809
Tell your mother and daddy we said hello.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.061
Yes, ma'am, and see you Sunday morning
bright and early.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.229
Oh, you will.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.858
Aren't they precious?
I wish Frank would date one of them.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.068
I wasn't going to meet up
with a bounty hunter unarmed.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.278
That's just common sense.

26:53.361 --> 26:54.404
Stranger danger.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.170
[scoffs]
He's not here. It's past six o'clock--

27:10.253 --> 27:11.921
Hey. What are you two doing in here?

27:12.339 --> 27:13.548
Come on, get over here.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.841
-[Blair scoffs]
-[Miles] Quick.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.472
Are you two crazy?

27:20.889 --> 27:22.682
That's The "Men's" Parlour.

27:23.391 --> 27:24.476
Neither of you are mens.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.894
Uh... [scoffs]

27:25.977 --> 27:27.604
Y-- Yeah, obviously.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.858
But, I don't see a Women's Parlour here.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.569
So, we're here in protest. Okay?

27:35.111 --> 27:37.489
♪ Show me what
a Women's Parlour looks like ♪

27:37.614 --> 27:40.075

-♪ Show me what a Women's-- ♪
-[interrupting]

27:42.619 --> 27:44.954
Uh-- Uh-- We're looking for John Stevens.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.207
We heard he had a meeting.
Know where we can find him?

27:47.290 --> 27:49.501
If I told you, I would lose my job.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.295
You know how weird this place is
about secrets and traditions.

27:57.467 --> 27:58.301
Hey, Miles.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.137
Hey.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.223
Miles, we, uh...

28:03.807 --> 28:04.683
really...

28:07.185 --> 28:09.521
need your help...

28:14.776 --> 28:15.777
here. So...

28:16.236 --> 28:17.070
Uh...

28:18.988 --> 28:20.573
All right, he's in the humidor.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.826
It's where a group of guys
called The Bourbon Club meet.

28:22.909 --> 28:23.743
Great. Where is it?

28:24.744 --> 28:26.746
-It's around that corner, but--
-Okay. Thanks, Miles.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.206
Okay, we'll see you later.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.006
Did you see that?
I, like, totally seduced him.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.967
[whispering] Focus! I think it's this.

28:39.050 --> 28:39.884
Oh.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.061
There's nothing here.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.020
Well...

28:52.147 --> 28:53.356
thanks for nothing, Miles.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.358
What are y'all in the mood for?

28:55.442 --> 28:58.611
We got top shelf or...
hell, we can all slum it with Beam.

28:58.695 --> 28:59.738

28:59.821 --> 29:02.532
[man] Find that single barrel
we like so much from Pigeon Forge. Mm.

29:02.615 --> 29:05.201
Anyway, now y'all gonna have to
believe me when I tell y'all...

29:05.660 --> 29:07.996
-that was Gerald.
-[man] And now you're tellin' fibs.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.749
[man 3] No, he's not.
Girl was there, and the cops were coming

29:10.832 --> 29:13.585
and John happened to be
at the motel bar.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.546
[chuckles]
Gerald asked him to take the fall.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.881
Gerald's got rage issues.

29:17.964 --> 29:21.176
Saying you're the one who beat up a whore
is a damn big sacrifice.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.636
He's been my business partner
for 18 years.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.971
Wife's in hospice care.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.182
Ovarian cancer's got her any day now.

29:27.974 --> 29:30.435
I couldn't let Gerald
ruin himself in her eyes,

29:30.518 --> 29:33.229
so when she passes, he'll confess.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.982
And until then, I'm hidin' out.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.066

[man 1] Dadgum, you're a good man, John.

[man 2] A lot better than I'd have done,
that's for damn sure.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.363
[man 1] Yeah, we know.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.907

29:43.990 --> 29:45.241

-[men chuckle]

29:45.784 --> 29:47.786

protecting his fuckboy partner.

We can't bring him in.

Dude, we need the money.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.968

Goddamn it, I thought you said
you knew what you were doin'.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.785
We thought that you said
that you knew what you were doing.

30:28.868 --> 30:32.330
Yeah, Bowser, so you must of...
had some misinformation.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.755
It was really good.
Did you have a good day?

31:22.839 --> 31:24.007
I had such a good day.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.758
-Okay, yeah... See ya.
-Do you--?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.094
-Okay.
-See ya. Uh, I go-- I got golf.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.513
You totally just boned.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.432
[sighs] We made love.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.601
You mean you boned, but slower?

31:35.643 --> 31:37.020
That must have been so intense.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.354
It was kind of awesome.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.814
Oh, my God. When he's--

31:39.898 --> 31:41.190
Hi, Sterling.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.692
-Hi, April.
-Hi, Blair.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.485
[whimpers]

31:44.569 --> 31:45.486
If my--

31:45.570 --> 31:47.071
If I didn't know my fate at this school

31:47.155 --> 31:49.449
rested in her cold little
condom-wrapper-grabbing hands,

31:49.532 --> 31:51.242
I'd feel bad for April about her dad.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.037
I hate her dumb bitch face but... yeah.

31:55.288 --> 31:58.207
If his business partner doesn't confess,
does he have to go to jail for him?

31:58.291 --> 32:00.668
She'd have one more thing to pray about,
that's for sure.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.921
[cell phone dings]

32:03.004 --> 32:04.631
Shit. Shit. Shit.

32:04.714 --> 32:05.924
Check your phone. Shit!

32:06.925 --> 32:07.967
[exhales deeply]

32:09.093 --> 32:11.304
-[groans]
-[cell phone bleeps]

32:14.098 --> 32:16.392
You don't have to sign who it's from.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.729
[cell phone bleeps]

32:21.981 --> 32:25.944
Disappointment is beyond
what your father and I feel right now.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.904
-We trusted you girls--
-The Volt is so small.

32:27.987 --> 32:30.073
Oh, you do not interrupt me
when I'm talking to you--!

32:30.156 --> 32:31.532
You do not interrupt your mother.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.284
Took your father's truck
without permission.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.369
You treated it like trash

32:34.452 --> 32:36.871
and what's more, you didn't even tell us
about crashing it.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.791
You were dishonest
and you were irresponsible.

32:43.711 --> 32:44.671
That's right.

32:47.006 --> 32:47.840
[clears throat]

32:47.924 --> 32:51.636
We've decided that you two
will have to pay for the repairs.

32:52.428 --> 32:55.473
That's right, you'll have to get jobs.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.350
[man] And if you can't handle that,

32:57.433 --> 32:59.936
then we will fix the truck
with the money we spend

33:00.019 --> 33:01.562
sending you to Willingham.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.647
Oh, that's good.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.440
See if y'all can handle public school.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.442
[woman]
Is that what y'all want? Public school?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.528
Where the principal wears blue jeans,

33:08.611 --> 33:10.113
and the classrooms are just

33:10.196 --> 33:12.657
one long bench and a chalkboard on wheels.

33:12.949 --> 33:13.908
-No, ma'am.
-Maybe.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.035
Young lady, don't you get smart with me.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.707
Now, are we understood?

33:22.208 --> 33:23.167
[both] Yes, ma'am.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.044
[woman]
Well, what are you waiting for? Go.

33:25.128 --> 33:25.962
Go!

33:28.214 --> 33:29.882
-[sighs] I'm just...
-Mm.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.885
[sighs] If we leave right now,
we can still make our court.

33:32.969 --> 33:33.803
Ooh.

33:33.886 --> 33:37.098
-[rock music playing]
-That's good good good good good good.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.018
-That's good.
-[knocking]

33:40.101 --> 33:41.269
-Go away!
-Hey.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.186
Or come in.

33:42.770 --> 33:43.604
Hey.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.067
Mm-mm.

33:50.903 --> 33:51.988
We need work, Bowser.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.990
And I need a big house with a white
picket fence

33:54.073 --> 33:56.367
and Tawny Kitaen in the back,
cooking me up some pancakes.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.910
-That's what I need.
-We're serious.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.412
-Yeah.
-Oh, I can tell.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.039
Well, I gave you a chance

34:01.289 --> 34:02.582
and you didn't catch the skip,

34:02.915 --> 34:04.542
so it doesn't sound promising to me.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.793
You can use us.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.712
We have a lot of power in the community.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.883
Like, the rich people community.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.342
[chuckling] Yeah, okay, then.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.677
Find me John Stevens.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.932
You know, solicitation of a prostitute
and battery,

34:20.016 --> 34:23.436
that just doesn't sound like John Stevens.
Are you sure that the charges are right?

34:23.519 --> 34:25.855
I would hate to put him away
if he didn't really do it.

34:25.938 --> 34:26.939
Hold it right there.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.942
A bounty hunter catches a guy
and collects the bounty.

34:30.026 --> 34:32.153
-Whether he did it--
-Or she...

34:34.530 --> 34:38.367
Whether he or she did it
is no concern of mine.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.578
And if you're real bounty hunters,

34:40.870 --> 34:42.330
it shouldn't be any of yours, either.

34:44.957 --> 34:47.001
-He knows we're not bounty hunters.
-Maybe he doesn't,

34:47.085 --> 34:48.127
so just chill.

34:48.211 --> 34:49.879
Okay. Yeah, I can do that.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.465
Just soooo chill.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.759
-Just super chill.
-Chill.

34:54.842 --> 34:55.885
So chill.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.682
[sniffs]
I know you're not really bounty hunters.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.809
-Aw, shit.
-Aw, shoot.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.020
I mean, "Come again, dog?"

35:06.896 --> 35:08.064
I ran your plates, kid.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.901
You're the teenage daughters
of Anderson and Deborah Wesley

35:11.984 --> 35:13.820
of 495 Albemarle Circle.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.781
Before that you were at
716 Margaret Mitchell.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.909
By the way, your mama
has six unpaid parking tickets.

35:20.201 --> 35:23.287
You post on TikTok 4.2 times a week.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.833
-Should I go on?
-TikTok is an art.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.417
How do you know all of that?

35:28.501 --> 35:30.044
Because I'm good at my job,

35:30.753 --> 35:32.880
which is why I was going
to let you get away with this

35:32.964 --> 35:34.924
until you deliver me John Stevens.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.717
He's a big payday,

35:37.426 --> 35:38.970
but obviously that's beyond your scope.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.681
But you said yourself
we're good at this stuff.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.432
Did I really say that?

35:44.183 --> 35:45.434
-Yes.
-I don't--

35:45.518 --> 35:48.938
Okay, but it just doesn't
make sense for me, girls.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.732
It'd be like I was babysitting.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.776
[chuckles]
And who wants to see me with a baby?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.444
Do you understand? Hell, come on.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.322
Feel free to come by here
any time to say hi.

35:58.406 --> 35:59.532
Because y'all crack me up.

35:59.615 --> 36:00.867
[mocking chuckle]

36:01.367 --> 36:02.952
[clears throat]

36:03.828 --> 36:05.913
Don't arrest John Stevens.
We have inside information.

36:05.997 --> 36:06.998
-He's innocent.
-Yeah.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.876
Inside information, hm?

36:10.501 --> 36:11.419
All right, let's see.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.379
Take a look at that.

36:14.046 --> 36:16.382
Security footage
from the night of the arrest.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.010
[Sterling] Oh, my gosh, it's totally him.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.641
This is bonkerballs.

36:25.725 --> 36:28.644
Mr. Stevens did it,
that little lying piece of shit.

36:28.728 --> 36:31.105
-He beat up that poor woman.
-We should have known.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.691
He just happened to be at the bar?
Motels don't have bars.

36:33.774 --> 36:34.609
Oh, yeah.

36:35.401 --> 36:37.403
God, you're so smart.
It's kind of annoying.

36:37.486 --> 36:38.404
Oh.

36:39.238 --> 36:40.615
Okay, we need to find him.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.742
Hey, text Miles and see
if he's at The Men's Parlour.

36:42.825 --> 36:43.743
Good idea.

36:47.914 --> 36:48.873
[cell phone bleeps]

36:51.959 --> 36:53.127
[cell phone bleeps]

36:53.211 --> 36:54.212
He said he can't tell me.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.297
-Tell him you'll go on a date with him.
-[groans]

36:59.467 --> 37:00.468
[cell phone bleeps]

37:03.137 --> 37:04.013
[cell phone bleeps]

37:04.096 --> 37:05.097
He's not there.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.182
[cell phone bleeps]

37:06.265 --> 37:07.099
Please!

37:07.433 --> 37:09.060
There's no way he's hiding out at home.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.395
How the hell are we gonna find out
where he went?

37:13.105 --> 37:14.190
I might have an idea.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.031
You might have an idea
or actually have an idea.

37:22.114 --> 37:24.242
No, I have an idea. Let me have my cool,
ominous moment.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.159
Okay, sorry.

37:27.161 --> 37:28.162
It's just not cool.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.580
[scoffs]

37:30.873 --> 37:32.708
Hey, April, we need to talk to you.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.127
The pressures of Fellowship
too much already?

37:35.753 --> 37:36.796
I wish I could help.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.381
Oh, bless your heart.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.883
Uh, no, we met with your daddy this week,

37:40.967 --> 37:44.387
and he so graciously offered to sponsor
our field trip to the soup kitchen.

37:44.470 --> 37:45.638
What a sweet man.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.890
Yeah, the problem is
that funding is due tomorrow

37:47.974 --> 37:50.142
and we can't seem to find him.
Do you know where he is?

37:50.226 --> 37:51.727
You met with him earlier this week?

37:51.811 --> 37:53.521
Yeah, Monday. Lovely office.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.855
Gorgeous interior design.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.150
That's funny, because he took
his helicopter to Hilton Head

37:58.234 --> 38:00.111
for a golf retreat ten days ago.

38:00.194 --> 38:01.904
-Ooh.
-Okay... what?

38:02.738 --> 38:03.656
I'll explain later.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.908
Oh. Sorry, did I say this past Monday?

38:05.992 --> 38:07.994
I meant the Monday before that.
I'm-- [chuckles]

38:08.077 --> 38:09.245
-It's been a long day...
-Yeah.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.831
...and yeah, my brain's like
melted into a puddle, and, yeah.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.128
I don't know what you little tramps
think you're up to,

38:17.670 --> 38:18.879
but I know you're lying.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.924
You do not want to mess with me, honey.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.553
Just need the money to continue
to spread Christ's love.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.431
-No need to get worked up about it.
-Stay away from my family.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.560
Have a blessed night.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.103
Oh, you too, sweetie.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.273
Read the room, Hannah B.
For the love of God, read the room.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.357
Hey, Sterl?

38:40.526 --> 38:43.904
I wonder what Ellen would say
if she knew

38:43.988 --> 38:48.200
that while I was home making
care packages for homeless teens,

38:48.451 --> 38:54.540
her star Fellowship leader was
spreading her legs for Luke Creswell

38:54.832 --> 38:55.958
in the senior lot.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.043
Gosh.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.795
What would the whole school... say?

39:04.717 --> 39:05.551
Hoarder.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.474
It was fun while it lasted, Sterl, huh?

39:12.099 --> 39:13.851
Our little life of badassery?

39:15.394 --> 39:16.854
Just would have been nice if it ended

39:16.937 --> 39:19.106
after we got the money
to pay back Mom and Dad.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.068
Maybe we can get jobs at that
other Yogurtopia on Peachtree.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.111
Might not suck so hard
if we get the same shift.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.864
"Hashtag
April helps sick kids through Christ."

39:26.947 --> 39:27.782
What?

39:28.449 --> 39:30.451
That's the hashtag of April's
discipleship weekend.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.828
Where she took that
stupid helicopter to her lake house.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.205
Oh, shit. Yeah.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.916
I bet he is hiding out there.

39:36.999 --> 39:38.209
But how do we find the address?

39:38.292 --> 39:40.461
Well, if April geo-tagged the photos,
then--

39:41.128 --> 39:42.671
[groans] Except she blocked me.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.673
And her dad's account is private.

39:46.926 --> 39:47.927
Unless...

39:51.097 --> 39:53.057
-[camera click sound]
-Ooh.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.225
Take one of me like this.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.311
Sterling take-- Sterling.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.108
Ster-- Sterling! What are you doing?

40:03.692 --> 40:06.362
Fake account, sexy profile pics,

40:06.445 --> 40:08.781
send a follow request and...

40:08.864 --> 40:10.116
Oh.

40:11.450 --> 40:12.368
And now we wait.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.285
Yeah.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.371
Okay.

40:16.705 --> 40:21.043
Top five... hottest guys at Willingham.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.421
Besides Luke and Jennings?

40:23.504 --> 40:25.673
[scoffs] Yeah. Of-- Of course...

40:25.756 --> 40:26.966
-Um...
-Okay.

40:27.049 --> 40:28.426
The first one's easy, obviously.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.010
-Owen Caruthers.
-Yeah. Chase Holten.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.137
-What? No!
-Eww.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.390
Owen's, like, spooky hot.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.642
Chase is, like, boring and hot.

40:36.725 --> 40:38.436
I like his hair-swoopy thing

40:38.519 --> 40:40.396
and he looks like he'd
be a really good cuddler.

40:40.980 --> 40:41.814
[mock gagging]

40:41.897 --> 40:44.316
Owen looks like he's going
to die of some old-timey disease.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.110
Yeah, I love that.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.570
-[cell phone chimes]
-Hey.

40:47.653 --> 40:48.779
Oh, dang, that was fast.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.739
[chuckles] Clearly a boob man.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.117
Okay, we have the address. Let's go!

40:53.200 --> 40:54.285
Wait wait wait wait....

40:54.368 --> 40:55.494
What about Fellowship?

40:56.162 --> 40:58.456
What about April
ruining your Christian reputation?

40:58.539 --> 41:00.249
He beat up a prostitute.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.210
Letting John Stevens walk around
free of judgment?

41:04.170 --> 41:06.380
That just wouldn't
be the Christian thing to do.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.632
Okay!

41:08.966 --> 41:10.259
Christ for the win!

41:12.803 --> 41:14.305
Badassery reinstated.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.978
[tires screech]

41:25.816 --> 41:27.485
[tires screech]

41:34.116 --> 41:34.950
It's coming up.

41:37.536 --> 41:38.704
He's not in the den.

41:38.787 --> 41:39.705
Go.

41:57.765 --> 41:58.641
Dude...

41:58.974 --> 41:59.808
Look. Look.

42:00.726 --> 42:01.894
[Sterling] That must be him.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.188
We're straight-up detectives.

42:05.064 --> 42:05.898
It's so baller.

42:05.981 --> 42:06.899
I feel baller.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.235
Adventure kind of makes me horny.

42:09.318 --> 42:10.694
Everything makes you horny.

42:10.945 --> 42:11.779
Come on.

42:14.698 --> 42:16.492
-[Blair and Sterling grunt]
-Dear Lord!

42:18.202 --> 42:19.036
Sterling?

42:19.411 --> 42:21.121
I want to say, Jessica?

42:21.205 --> 42:22.873
[chuckling]
What are you ladies doing here?

42:22.957 --> 42:24.875
You know, you're lucky
I didn't use my gun.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.253
That's okay. We'll use ours.

42:27.336 --> 42:28.295
[grunts]

42:28.379 --> 42:29.213
Prostitute beater!

42:31.507 --> 42:32.675
The hell are you doing?

42:33.092 --> 42:35.469
-I'll have you arrested. What the hell?
-[gun cocks]

42:35.553 --> 42:37.638
Actually, Mr. Stevens,
it's kind of the opposite.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.515
We're having you arrested.

42:39.598 --> 42:40.975
-We'll have you arrested.
-What?

42:41.058 --> 42:42.726
Remember when you thought
it would be cool

42:42.810 --> 42:45.145
to cheat on your wife with a prostitute
and then beat her up?

42:45.604 --> 42:47.356
Turns out, not so cool.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.400
-Yeah, not so cool.
-You little cunts.

42:49.483 --> 42:50.943
-[girls gasp]
-"Little C-words?"

42:51.360 --> 42:53.612
Mr. Stevens,
you crossed a line. That's nasty.

42:53.696 --> 42:54.989
Guess what else is nasty?

42:55.864 --> 42:57.324
I've peed in your pool.

42:58.617 --> 42:59.493
A bunch.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.662
How dare you? Get out of my way!

43:01.745 --> 43:02.788
[grunts]

43:02.871 --> 43:04.081
Oh, nice move, goalie.

43:04.164 --> 43:06.667
[Blair]
Yeah. Gave him the old "Wesley check".

43:06.750 --> 43:09.420
By the way, my name is Blair, bitch.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.966
[rock music playing]

43:14.049 --> 43:15.384
-Can you "drink" me?
-Yep.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.681
God, I'm still absolutely starving.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.600
-I've literally never been hungrier.
-[groans]

43:22.683 --> 43:23.767
Oh, y'all gonna be sorry.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.102
Hey, Mr. Stevens?

43:25.561 --> 43:27.062
Could you shut the fuck up?

43:29.732 --> 43:31.942
...and we asked about the help wanted
poster.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.986
And he, like, hired us on the spot.

43:34.069 --> 43:36.447
Another great thing
is the hours are flexible

43:36.530 --> 43:37.740
and they're open late.

43:37.823 --> 43:40.284
So, instead of going to parties,
you can go to work.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.660
[chuckling]

43:41.744 --> 43:42.620
That sounds fair.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.664
So tell me, what's the pay?

43:45.748 --> 43:47.499
-Oh.
-Oh. I think it's like, um...

43:47.916 --> 43:49.043
like a hundred...

43:49.126 --> 43:50.252
Fifty?

43:50.336 --> 43:51.962
A hundred fifty dollars an hour?

43:52.254 --> 43:54.214
-[Sterling] Oh, no--
-[Blair] Dollars? No.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.633
-Like, dimes an hour.
-Yeah.

43:55.716 --> 43:56.717
Obviously.

43:57.259 --> 43:58.844
-That's fifteen bucks an hour.
-Yeah.

43:58.927 --> 44:00.846
[Blair] Right? Because when in, um--

44:00.929 --> 44:03.390
Hi, Mr. Bowser! Meet our parents.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.475
Ah.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.517
Hey.

44:06.393 --> 44:07.728
-Hi!
-[Bowser] All right.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.439
Yeah, all right.

44:10.981 --> 44:13.692
Gotta get this... [mumbling]

44:14.234 --> 44:15.944
Oh, hey, you know, hey. The kids...

44:16.028 --> 44:17.696
Uh, they're good.

44:18.238 --> 44:19.698
Uh, good job. Yeah.

44:20.574 --> 44:22.326
-They're all right.
-[Bowser] Yes, all right.

44:22.951 --> 44:26.205
[chuckling] All right.
Well, we will see y'all at home.

44:26.288 --> 44:27.706
-Yeah.
-Be safe.

44:27.790 --> 44:31.502
Blair, honey, don't you think
maybe you should tie your hair back?

44:31.585 --> 44:33.045
You know, being around all this food.

44:33.128 --> 44:34.505
Yeah. Yes, Mama.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.882
Okay. Oh, nice to meet you.

44:37.257 --> 44:38.634
Uh... toodle-oo, then.

44:38.717 --> 44:39.635
Take care, Miss Cathy.

44:40.219 --> 44:41.053
-Love you!
-Bye!

44:41.136 --> 44:42.596
-[Debbie] Love y'all.
-Drive safe.

44:44.264 --> 44:45.182
[Sterling sighs]

44:48.102 --> 44:49.186
Sterling, who am I?

44:52.648 --> 44:53.816
Well, hey, who am I?

44:55.025 --> 44:57.569
No, her hand's... Her hand's here.

44:59.613 --> 45:00.698
Ah, Jesus.

45:01.657 --> 45:03.283
What's happening? Did y'all pay for that?

45:03.367 --> 45:05.285
You can just take it
out of our fifty percent.

45:05.869 --> 45:09.832
Okay, girls, you need to understand that
there's a seniority in this business,

45:10.165 --> 45:12.126
and I've been doing it
much longer than you have,

45:12.209 --> 45:15.337
so that has earned me
a certain level of status, see?

45:16.088 --> 45:17.840
So I'll give you 2K

45:18.382 --> 45:21.468
and the name of my guy who'll
fix your truck up for you cheap.

45:21.927 --> 45:22.761
Um...

45:23.679 --> 45:26.306
Well, what if we don't accept that?

45:26.849 --> 45:28.183
Oh, this is you playing hardball?

45:28.267 --> 45:29.518
-Sure.
-[chuckles] Okay.

45:29.601 --> 45:31.145
Seeing as how you're underage

45:31.228 --> 45:33.313
and can't secure a license to bounty hunt,

45:34.022 --> 45:35.482
if you want to keep working with me,

45:36.608 --> 45:39.945
I don't think you have any options
but to accept my terms.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.323
So, you want to keep working with us?

45:44.158 --> 45:45.242
[snickers]

45:46.326 --> 45:48.829
I suppose I could, uh, see your potential

45:48.912 --> 45:50.914
to broaden my access around these parts.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.917
[knocking]

45:54.001 --> 45:54.918
Oh, Jesus.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.004
[woman]
Yelp says you don't close until eleven.

45:58.338 --> 46:00.174
-So does your voicemail.
-Goddamn it.

46:01.008 --> 46:02.301
Visors on, let's go.

46:02.384 --> 46:04.344
[rock music]

46:04.428 --> 46:05.304
Hey.

46:08.807 --> 46:09.641
Come on.

46:12.686 --> 46:14.813
And put that hair in a bun or somethin'.
Fix it up.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.732
[Blair] You sound like my mom.
