00:01.330 --> 00:03.491
Previously on Elementary...
WATSON: Emil Kurtz.

00:03.530 --> 00:05.794
Do I know you?

00:05.830 --> 00:07.639
We have a friend in common:
Morland Holmes.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.206
Oh, uh, nice to meet you.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.629
Morland asked me to find
a mole in his office.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.230
In other words,
he asked me to find you.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.474
KURTZ:
That's everything I could find

00:15.510 --> 00:17.171
on all our _
recent dealings In Russna.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.541
I think he's on to me.
Emil...

00:18.580 --> 00:21.469
No. We're done.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.589
Because if I keep helping you,

00:22.620 --> 00:24.087
we are both gonna get caught.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.588
Marcus Bell, Major Case.

00:26.620 --> 00:27.757
What have we got?

00:27.790 --> 00:29.553
Robbery gone bad, sounds like.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.148
First victim...

00:31.190 --> 00:32.794
Emil Kurtz.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.091
BELL: The cook who
survived is outside,

00:38.130 --> 00:40.064
giving his full statement.

00:40.100 --> 00:44.332
He described the shooter as
a white male, sunglasses,

00:44.370 --> 00:46.429
and a hoodie pulled tight
around his face.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.835
Said he grabbed a female
customer near the door,

00:48.880 --> 00:50.404
held her at gunpoint,

00:50.450 --> 00:52.247
and demanded the money
in the register.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.209
Any idea why it turned
into a bloodbath?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.750
Cashier refuse or

01:00.790 --> 01:02.621
go for a weapon?

01:02.660 --> 01:04.651
Someone try
to be a hero?

01:04.690 --> 01:06.453
BELL: Cook said there
was a lot of yelling,

01:06.500 --> 01:07.558
he didn't make out.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.658
Plus, he didn't see much,

01:08.700 --> 01:09.667
'cause he was ducked behind

01:09.700 --> 01:10.667
the counter the whole time.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.167
But as far as he could tell,

01:12.200 --> 01:14.566
everyone was trying
to cooperate.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.737
Something must have
spooked the guy,

01:15.770 --> 01:17.408
and he just opened fire.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.270
Cashier's name _was
Istvan Drakoullas.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.470
Victim over there is Emil Kurtz.

01:23.510 --> 01:25.205
Female hostage
was shot there.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.740
Her name was Angela Lee.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.247
She died en route to St. Bede's.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.884
And Angela's sister, Jordan Lee,

01:29.920 --> 01:31.182
caught a bullet in the arm.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.551
She's also at St. Bede's,

01:32.590 --> 01:34.387
but she's in stable condition.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.183
Now, the owner of this place
lives out in Commack.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.857
He's on his way here.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.694
Did the cook know the order
the victims were shot in?

01:41.730 --> 01:43.459
Whether it seemed
like the shooter

01:45.430 --> 01:47.591
Did he talk to any of the
customers before it all started?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.609
I'll go find out.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.299
Gonna make me ask,
aren't you?

02:12.330 --> 02:14.594
Your fixation on the male
customer, Emil Kurtz.

02:14.630 --> 02:16.723
I mean, to the best
of my knowledge,

02:16.770 --> 02:18.465
his relevance to the crime
could only be described

02:18.500 --> 02:20.161
as "victim from_
barstool number srx."

02:20.200 --> 02:22.600
But to you, clearly,
his presence means more.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.868
You think he was
the intended target.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.574
You've been acting
secretively, for weeks now.

02:27.610 --> 02:29.544
Sudden social engagements
with unnamed friends.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.172
Last minute calls
to take your mother

02:31.210 --> 02:33.474
to a doctor's appointment,
which you did not do.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.646
I've respected your privacy
up to this point.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.614
I thought perhaps
you had a new lover

02:36.650 --> 02:37.878
that you didn't want
to talk about yet.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.683
Whatever it was,
I trusted that you would

02:39.720 --> 02:41.756
discuss it with me in time,
but now, now you're

02:41.790 --> 02:43.189
withholding evidence that
pertains to three homicides.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.857
I was going to tell you
when we got home, okay?

02:44.890 --> 02:46.619
I just didn't want to get
into it in front of Marcus.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.196
At least not
until we're sure.

02:48.230 --> 02:49.424
Sure of what?

02:50.830 --> 02:52.889
You're right.
I knew Emil Kurtz.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.192
He's the person
I've been meeting with.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.868
He worked for your father.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.605
And if what I suspect is true,

02:59.640 --> 03:01.733
this is not the scene
of a triple murder.

03:01.780 --> 03:05.272
This is the scene of a _double
murder and an assassmatlon.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.647
*

03:16.460 --> 03:17.757
WATSON:
Sherlock.

03:17.790 --> 03:18.825
How could you
have been so reckless?

03:18.860 --> 03:20.350
Were you under the impression

03:20.400 --> 03:21.719
you were dealing
with a nice man?
No. I...

03:21.760 --> 03:23.864
Perhaps I under-played
the danger.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.720
Perhaps my consistently
referring to my father

03:25.770 --> 03:27.567
as the devil incarnate
wasn't clear.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.864
He has armies on his payroll.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.605
He has mercenaries
on speed dIal.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.733
There are countries that you
learned the name of as a child,

03:33.780 --> 03:35.532
that no longer exist
because of him.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.400
Would you just
let me speak?
So you can explain to me

03:37.450 --> 03:38.747
why you recruited an informant

03:38.780 --> 03:40.771
inside his office
without telling me?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.708
Only to leave him there
at his peril?!

03:42.750 --> 03:44.889
Yes! Yes! And it is because

03:44.920 --> 03:46.581
Morland is so dangerous
that I did.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.611
Ever since we found out

03:48.660 --> 03:50.287
that someone tried
to kill your father,

03:50.330 --> 03:51.558
you said that we
could get caught

03:51.590 --> 03:52.898
in the crossfire of a war.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.420
And since he's
had Krasnov's name,

03:54.460 --> 03:55.927
he's been keeping us
out of the loop.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.791
One of us had to find out
what he was up to.

03:57.830 --> 04:00.435
And your rationale for
acting behind my back?

04:00.470 --> 04:02.904
Because maybe your judgment

04:02.940 --> 04:04.635
when it comes to your father,
isn't the best.

04:04.670 --> 04:08.970
You know that I trust you.

04:09.010 --> 04:10.978
Just not when
it comes to Morland.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.841
Yes, I took matters
into my own hands,

04:12.880 --> 04:14.768
but I did not kill
those people in the diner.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.311
The question is whether he did.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.853
The first thing we need to
do is find the shooter.

04:19.890 --> 04:21.357
Marcus said there
was another wrtness.

04:21.390 --> 04:23.654
The sister
of the woman who died.

04:23.690 --> 04:25.351
We should talk to her.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.893
You do it.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.989
Given our suspicions,
I think it's time

04:30.030 --> 04:33.363
that Captain Gregson
learned about Morland Holmes.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.697
And he should hear it from me.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.833
Although, first,

04:36.870 --> 04:40.601
I would like to look
my father in the eye.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.648
MORLAND:
Sherlock.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.874
We can finish later.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.382
Something wrong?

04:54.420 --> 04:57.025
Unfortunately, I'm here
to deliver some sad news.

04:58.630 --> 04:59.824
There was a restaurant robbery

04:59.860 --> 05:02.727
on the Upper East Side,
a few hours ago.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.624
Gunfire broke out.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.991
A number of people were killed.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.769
An employee of yours
was among them.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.903
Emil Kurtz.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.977
Dear Lord.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.604
How dreadful.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.544
Has his wife been informed?

05:19.580 --> 05:20.911
She's not here in New York.

05:20.950 --> 05:23.441
They're from Boston, I think.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.845
I'll have Elizabeth
give you the information.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.620
(sighs) Is there anything
else I can do?

05:29.660 --> 05:32.049
Actually, there is.

05:32.090 --> 05:34.524
I'd like to review
Mr. Kurtz's work.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.721
Take a look at his office,
his computer, his files,

05:36.770 --> 05:38.692
phone records, obviously.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.460
You said it was a robbery.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.934
I assumed that Emil
was a bystander.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.370
Do you suspect otherwise?

05:46.410 --> 05:48.537
Not yet, but one cannot ignore
the nature of your work.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.105
And given the history of attacks
against you and your business,

05:51.150 --> 05:53.812
best to leave no stone unturned.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.518
I'm going to say no, for now.

05:59.560 --> 06:03.052
Emil was involved in sensitive
prOJects, still ongomg.

06:03.090 --> 06:05.456
And, obviously,
I trust you to be discreet,

06:05.490 --> 06:08.493
but, uh, I have to consider
what my clients will say.

06:08.530 --> 06:11.090
If your investigation reveals

06:11.130 --> 06:14.668
that Emil was a target,
I will reconsider.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.929
I hope you understand.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.400
Of course.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.939
And you needn't worry, Father.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.811
I'll be taking the lead
on this case.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.114
I will find
whoever's responsible,

06:32.150 --> 06:34.118
and I will see to it
that they pay.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.962
JORDAN:
I guess he was in his 40s.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.092
It was hard to tell.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.095
NURSE:
Here you go.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.960
Thank you.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.432
JORDAN: The hood
and the sunglasses,

06:51.470 --> 06:52.801
you could barely
see his face.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.900
It happened so fast.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.811
Uh, he was kind of tall,
I think.

06:59.850 --> 07:03.479
Do you remember if he
had any facial hair?

07:03.520 --> 07:06.683
He had gray and brown stubble.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.085
WATSON:
The EMT said that

07:08.120 --> 07:09.826
Angela didn't die
from the gunshot wound.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.589
They said it was anaphylaxis.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.928
Her airway shut from a
severe allergic reaction.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.019
They gave her epinephrine
and tried to intubate,

07:16.060 --> 07:17.960
but they couldn't save her.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.230
Yeah. It happened just
after the guy ran off.

07:20.270 --> 07:22.534
We were waiting for help.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.231
Angie said she couldn't breathe,

07:24.270 --> 07:27.637
and... she was wheezing.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.477
I thought she was
going into shock,

07:29.510 --> 07:32.104
so I tried to keep her calm
until the ambulance came.

07:32.150 --> 07:35.938
But then her eyes started
to swell shut, and, um,

07:35.980 --> 07:38.744
her, uh, her skin broke out.

07:38.790 --> 07:42.248
She was unconscious before
the ambulance even got there.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.555
Strange as it may sound,

07:45.590 --> 07:47.729
if she was allergic to something
on the shooter's clothes,

07:47.760 --> 07:49.489
it might help us catch him.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.191
Was she having any symptoms
before he grabbed her?

07:51.230 --> 07:53.835
Is it possible it was
something in the food?

07:53.870 --> 07:55.599
No. She didn't have
any food allergies.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.904
No one in my family does.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.931
Had she ever had this
kind of reaction before?

08:01.610 --> 08:04.499
Once. We were teenagers.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.871
Our family went to go see
a talk show get filmed.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.273
We had front row seats
and one of the guests

08:08.320 --> 08:09.810
was an animal trainer.

08:09.850 --> 08:12.182
He brought out
a bunch of animals.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.984
Angie had
the same reaction then.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.658
We had to take her to the ER.

08:16.690 --> 08:19.818
You ever find out
which animal caused it?

08:19.860 --> 08:21.725
Yeah, the doctor's ran tests.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.296
They said the only one
she was allergic to

08:23.330 --> 08:24.820
was the mountain lion.

08:27.870 --> 08:29.667
GREGSON:
You know, that's the first time

08:29.710 --> 08:34.033
you even mentioned your father,
more than just in passing.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.900
My dad brokers in global misery

08:35.940 --> 08:38.079
isn't the sort of thing
that usually comes up.

08:38.110 --> 08:40.169
Well, it's just, uh...

08:40.220 --> 08:43.041
This is a lot
to take in at once.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.741
Do you really think he
might have arranged

08:45.790 --> 08:49.851
a triple murder just to get rid
of a spy in his office?

08:49.890 --> 08:51.585
He never heard
of just firing the guy?

08:51.630 --> 08:52.995
I know it sounds extreme,

08:53.030 --> 08:55.828
but my father
is a man of extremes.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.691
You okay?

08:57.730 --> 09:00.039
Why wouldn't I be?

09:00.070 --> 09:03.904
You just told me you suspect
your own dad of murder.

09:03.940 --> 09:06.261
"Are you okay?" seems like
a reasonable question.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.868
I think perhaps you're imagining

09:07.910 --> 09:10.003
a different sort
of father-son relationship.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.075
Or a father-son relationship.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.044
But thank you.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.108
I'm not just asking
for your sake.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.289
I have to think
about the case.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.084
I should tell you, right now,
to keep your distance,

09:22.120 --> 09:24.827
let us do our jobs.

09:24.860 --> 09:27.158
But you and I both know
that wouldn't stop you.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.567
So, instead,
I'm gonna trust you.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.705
Let me guess:

09:38.740 --> 09:40.879
You saw a mouse.

09:40.910 --> 09:43.879
Are you familiar
with the term umwelt?

09:43.910 --> 09:46.105
No, but I have a feeling
I'm about to me.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.913
German origin.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.884
Refers to one's
subjective experience,

09:49.920 --> 09:52.047
as dictated by our biology.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.284
If there were a mouse,

09:53.320 --> 09:55.185
to it, you and I
would be giants.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.859
To a giraffe, we are small.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.926
And what animal are you trying

09:59.960 --> 10:00.858
to see the world as
from up there?

10:00.900 --> 10:03.289
Surveillance device.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.732
Pretty sure I got 'em all.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.658
Just having a last look around.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.109
Emil Kurtz lived
in this apartment.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.007
It was a company perk,
provided by your father.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.372
Mm-hmm. I found drywall dust

10:17.410 --> 10:19.878
on the floor,
beneath the spots

10:19.920 --> 10:21.171
where these were hidden.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.085
The floors were very
recently polished.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.748
I'd say they were planted
somewhere in the last few days.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.815
That would support our notion

10:27.860 --> 10:31.023
that my father identified Emil
Kurtz as the mole and in turn,

10:31.060 --> 10:31.981
our theory of motive.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.156
Hm.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.350
And your lion hunt?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.265
Marcus and I called
the zoos around the city.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.097
None of them have a mountain
km on exhibit right now.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.231
Could be our shooter
had one as a pet.

10:42.270 --> 10:45.433
Yes, but that would be illegal.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.971
And a triple murderer would
never risk a violation

10:47.010 --> 10:48.375
from the Health Department.
The point is,

10:48.410 --> 10:49.946
the lion wouldn't be registered,

10:49.980 --> 10:51.140
so there would be no way
to search for it.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.875
There is, however, a way to
search for dead mountain lions.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.673
Taxidermists.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.086
There are only three in the city
that deal with large mammals.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.111
Marcus is checking
them out right now.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.151
So do you think this is what

11:02.190 --> 11:04.385
your father was doing in the
brownstone the other night?

11:04.430 --> 11:05.886
Planting cameras to spy on us?

11:05.930 --> 11:07.158
I checked.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.849
There were none.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.835
I was wrong to lay
into you so harshly,

11:12.870 --> 11:13.837
when you told me about Kurtz.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.861
You're right.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.458
None of this is your fault.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.738
It's his.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.807
I mentioned

11:21.840 --> 11:23.307
umwelt

11:23.350 --> 11:25.705
because _I've been
contemplating my own.

11:25.750 --> 11:29.880
Biology dictates reality.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.889
I am the son of Morland Holmes.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.854
Make of that what you will.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.851
(phone rings)

11:40.960 --> 11:42.188
It's Marcus.

11:42.230 --> 11:44.892
Hey. Sherlock's here, too.

11:44.930 --> 11:47.398
BELL: Looking at taxidermists
was a good idea.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.761
We just picked one up at Staten
Island who fits the description

11:49.810 --> 11:52.233
of the_ shooter and he‘s been
working on a mountain lion.

11:52.270 --> 11:55.137
We're bringing him
into the station now.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.738
BELL:
We don't see any point

11:56.780 --> 11:58.441
beating around
the bush, Mr. Tetch,

11:58.480 --> 12:00.243
so here's where we're at.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.408
Your hands tested positive
for gunshot residue.

12:03.450 --> 12:06.317
So did the hoodie we found in
the Dumpster behind your shop.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.352
The hoodie also had blood
spatter on it that...

12:08.390 --> 12:10.028
let's be honest,

12:10.060 --> 12:11.948
we all know it's going
to come back a match

12:11.990 --> 12:13.821
for the people you shot
at the diner today.

12:13.860 --> 12:17.159
So... we're not looking
for some kind of confession

12:17.200 --> 12:19.168
or a way to prove
we got the right guy.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.498
We know we got
the right guy.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.167
GREGSON:
That being said,

12:23.210 --> 12:25.405
some of our colleagues
have a theory

12:25.440 --> 12:28.273
that you were hired
to shoot up that diner,

12:28.310 --> 12:30.346
and that the person
that hired you

12:30.380 --> 12:32.439
had a certain victim in mind.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.914
Now if our _
colleagues are right,

12:34.950 --> 12:37.089
you'll do yourself
a favor by speaking up.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.179
We'd relay your
cooperation to the DA--

12:39.220 --> 12:40.949
Save your breath.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.514
I'll take the deal.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.027
I'll tell you about the guy.

12:44.060 --> 12:46.221
I'm going to prison.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.058
He's still out there.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.022
I'm not even going to get
to keep the money he gave me,

12:51.070 --> 12:52.298
so screw him.

12:52.330 --> 12:55.163
Okay.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.304
I only knew him as "Mr. King."

12:57.340 --> 13:00.036
I had a sense it was fake
when he said it,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.377
but that's all I got.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.071
How'd you meet him?

13:03.110 --> 13:04.407
He came into _
the showroom a few times.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.374
He bought a couple
of birds I'd stuffed.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.819
We would talk.

13:08.850 --> 13:11.239
What did Mr. King look like?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.439
White.

13:12.490 --> 13:15.118
Plain. In his 40s.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.582
Someone who worked
for your father?

13:16.620 --> 13:18.178
After this,
we'll go talk

13:18.230 --> 13:20.289
to the middle-aged
white man he employs.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.093
Oh, no, wait.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.927
There are
several hundred.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.165
_ I could tell he was _
working his way up to something,

13:26.200 --> 13:29.033
and eventually he asked me

13:29.070 --> 13:31.106
if I was looking for
better-paying work.

13:31.140 --> 13:33.973
He gave me 50 grand

13:34.010 --> 13:35.307
and the gun to do it.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.001
And instructions.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.610
Where, when...

13:39.650 --> 13:42.448
and a photo of the person
I was supposed to kill.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.016
He said he'd make sure
they were there.

13:46.090 --> 13:47.409
This the guy you
were hired to kill?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.859
Yes.

13:48.890 --> 13:50.289
That's Emil Kurtz.

13:52.530 --> 13:54.088
Maybe I should be clearer.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.519
Kurtz was today.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.619
I'm still talking
about the first time.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.639
Wait a second.

14:01.670 --> 14:04.332
Are you saying the guy
that paid you to kill Kurtz

14:04.370 --> 14:06.361
also paid you
to kill someone else?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.275
A few weeks ago.

14:08.310 --> 14:11.507
I told you I was going
to help you catch this guy.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.518
It's not like I'm going
to go away any longer

14:13.550 --> 14:14.949
for four bodies than three.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.615
You guys want to hear
about the first one or not?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.311
GREGSON:
Yeah, we want to hear
about that one, too.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.669
GREGSON: This is Joan Watson,
Sherlock Holmes.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.338
Assistant District Attorney
Eric Madison.

14:33.370 --> 14:36.589
The other murder
that Arthur Tetch confessed to,

14:36.640 --> 14:39.359
Patricia Naylor,
turns out that she consulted

14:39.410 --> 14:42.208
for the D.A.'s Office
as a forensic psychiatrist.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.504
We know. We've been
looking into her, too.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.506
Uh, Dr. Naylor
was shot to death

14:46.550 --> 14:48.677
in her Greenwich home
three weeks ago.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.542
The details appear to match
what Mr. Tetch described.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.080
Detectives up there
thought she walked in

14:54.120 --> 14:55.678
on a burglary in progress.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.221
You're telling me it was
some kind of assassination.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.625
Tetch gave up

14:58.660 --> 15:00.525
where he dumped the
weapons from both crimes.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.050
Ballistics were matches,

15:02.100 --> 15:04.068
so, looks like
he's telling the truth.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.920
Dr. Naylor did psych
evals for your office.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.494
Is that correct?

15:07.540 --> 15:08.632
She interviewed defendants
to determine

15:08.670 --> 15:10.638
competency to stand trial.

15:10.670 --> 15:13.070
And she would testify as an
expert witness to help juries

15:13.110 --> 15:15.635
understand the legal burden
of an insanity defense.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.001
If someone is, say,
a cannibal serial killer,

15:18.050 --> 15:19.608
that's not enough
to call them crazy.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.618
As long as you know that eating
and killing your victims

15:21.650 --> 15:24.118
is wrong, you're considered sane
in the eyes of the law.

15:24.150 --> 15:26.243
That's what the law says.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.609
In the work that
Dr. Naylor did for you,

15:27.660 --> 15:29.287
did the name Morland Holmes
ever come up?

15:29.320 --> 15:31.459
Holmes? Related to you?

15:31.490 --> 15:34.050
That's what the law says.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.352
Well, the name's not familiar,
but Dr. Naylor consulted

15:36.400 --> 15:38.960
on dozens of cases
over more than a decade.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.638
I wouldn't know everyone
she dealt with.

15:40.670 --> 15:43.138
Someone should look over
those cases. I can do that.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.331
Dr. Naylor taught psychiatry
at SUNY Downstate.

15:45.370 --> 15:46.632
Her office is
also worth a visit.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.137
Hmm. All right.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.977
We appreciate you coming by.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.204
If we have any more questions,
we'll let you know.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.308
Anything I can do to help.

15:54.150 --> 15:56.448
Before you head out,
my office a minute?

16:02.760 --> 16:05.627
I keep going over everything
Tetch told us last night,

16:05.660 --> 16:09.323
and I keep coming back
to the same question.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.090
Who hires a killer this way?

16:12.130 --> 16:15.099
Some guy walks into the
shop of a total stranger.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.608
No history that says that
that stranger is up for murder,

16:17.640 --> 16:20.632
and offers him 50 grand a pop
for rubbing people out?

16:20.680 --> 16:24.207
Obviously there would have been
some indication that Tetch

16:24.250 --> 16:26.047
was open to such a proposal.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.243
We can ask Mr. King
when we find him.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.212
That why you
asked me in here?

16:32.450 --> 16:34.213
I wanted to check
In one more time.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.750
Given what we know

16:35.790 --> 16:38.623
about who Dr. Naylor was,
and what she did,

16:38.660 --> 16:40.548
and given the way
Tetch was hired,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.295
you still think
this is all going

16:42.330 --> 16:44.628
to lead back
to your father?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.537
We both heard Tetch confirm
that Emil Kurtz was the target.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.390
That gives my father motive.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.805
We might not see
all the strings yet,

16:50.840 --> 16:54.298
but he is a puppet master
of the highest order.

16:54.340 --> 16:56.433
One more time before what?

16:56.480 --> 16:57.572
You said you wanted
to check in one more time bef...

16:57.610 --> 16:59.373
Before I pay him a visit.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.269
You want me to join you?

17:02.320 --> 17:04.413
No. Just me.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.888
I want to see him for myself.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.625
MORLAND:
Captain Gregson.

17:14.660 --> 17:18.198
What an unexpected honor
to finally meet you.

17:18.230 --> 17:19.367
Oh, well, thanks
for seeing me.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.469
Oh, nonsense.

17:21.670 --> 17:22.830
Tea?

17:22.870 --> 17:25.236
No, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

17:25.270 --> 17:26.339
Please.

17:26.370 --> 17:27.576
Thanks.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.703
I assume you're here about

17:31.750 --> 17:35.277
the death of my associate,
Emil Kurtz.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.539
One of my staff saw on the news
that you'd arrested a suspect.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.410
The guy's name is Arthur Tetch.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.484
Did you ever hear of him?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.624
No, I don't think so.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.652
Mm. Turns out
he was hired to do it.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.851
Hired?

17:48.900 --> 17:50.390
To rob a luncheonette?

17:50.430 --> 17:53.866
Hired to kill Emil Kurtz
specifically.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.494
All the other
people he shot

17:56.540 --> 17:58.531
were just window dressing.

18:00.310 --> 18:01.868
Does it surprise
you to hear that?

18:01.910 --> 18:04.242
It does.

18:05.480 --> 18:09.814
Emil was, uh... a good man.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.841
Tetch claims it
wasn't his first hit.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.357
That a couple weeks ago,

18:13.390 --> 18:14.789
he was paid to
kill someone else--

18:14.820 --> 18:18.449
a psychiatrist
named Patricia Naylor.

18:18.490 --> 18:21.653
You ever heard of her?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.122
Why would I?

18:23.170 --> 18:26.469
Is it my imagination,
Captain,

18:26.500 --> 18:30.334
or are you asking me questions
as if I were a suspect?

18:30.370 --> 18:34.170
They're just questions.

18:34.210 --> 18:37.646
Tetch said that the guy who
hired him was named King.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.170
Does that ring any bells?

18:39.210 --> 18:41.371
I know many kings.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.581
Quite a few princes, too.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.544
This guy's last name was King.

18:46.590 --> 18:50.856
Captain, let's cut to the chase.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.688
I'm aware that my son
thinks I'm a monster,

18:53.730 --> 18:57.496
and I assume he's convinced you
of some outlandish things,

18:57.530 --> 19:00.693
but I hope that won't color the
course of your investigation.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.232
I got a pretty good head
on my shoulders...

19:04.270 --> 19:09.776
but in my experience,
Sherlock is a pretty smart guy.

19:09.810 --> 19:14.315
He also has a knack for
self-destruction.

19:14.350 --> 19:19.447
Those close to him must always
take care not to follow suit.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.327
Thanks for
taking the time.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.693
Oh, isn't this the part where
you tell me not to leave town?

19:34.940 --> 19:36.737
Listen, I'm just a cop.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.306
You... you're... (sighs)

19:38.340 --> 19:40.934
you got all this.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.541
I know I couldn't keep you
in town even if I wanted to.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.377
But you're right about Sherlock.

19:46.410 --> 19:48.469
He_ has some
strong opinions about you.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.909
About what you are.

19:50.950 --> 19:53.350
And if he's right,

19:53.390 --> 19:55.688
I got to wonder
if he and Joan are safe.

19:59.860 --> 20:02.328
If anything happens to them,

20:02.360 --> 20:06.524
the next time you see me,
I won't be a cop.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.000
BELL:
Is it me,

20:13.040 --> 20:15.235
or did Dr. Naylor testify
for the prosecution

20:15.280 --> 20:17.407
in every one of these cases?

20:17.450 --> 20:20.010
Never met a defendant
who wasn't sane?

20:20.050 --> 20:21.472
Uh, I think she'd

20:21.520 --> 20:22.976
sometimes decline to testify.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.578
Maybe those were the times

20:24.620 --> 20:25.689
she didn't see eye-to-eye
with the DA?

20:25.720 --> 20:28.518
BELL: There's a follow-up
on this one.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.927
Says the defendant
hanged himself in prison.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.723
Maybe a family member
who thought he belonged

20:33.760 --> 20:36.854
in a mental health facility,
took it out on Dr. Naylor.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.868
What are the chances that
the same family member

20:38.900 --> 20:41.767
wanted Emil Kurtz dead?

20:41.800 --> 20:44.337
Dr. Naylor ever mention
the name Morland Holmes?

20:44.370 --> 20:45.735
Sorry, no.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.739
Calendars and contacts.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.338
Are there any more that
we could see elsewhere?

20:50.380 --> 20:54.009
You'd have to ask
her secretary-- Margaret.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.938
She's not here.

20:55.980 --> 20:58.642
The school only gave her two
weeks after Dr. Naylor died.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.011
And where do you go, now?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.709
Do you get assigned
another teacher?

21:02.760 --> 21:04.978
I stay here,
help with continuity

21:05.030 --> 21:07.590
when they choose
a new supervisor.

21:07.630 --> 21:08.995
Our grant is funded
through the end of next year.

21:09.030 --> 21:10.918
HOLMES:
Your grant.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.292
You introduced yourself as
Dr. Naylor's research assistant.

21:14.340 --> 21:17.309
What exactly is the
research you're doing here?

21:20.340 --> 21:21.534
HOLMES: Dead cockroach.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.639
What are you doing?

21:23.680 --> 21:25.898
I'm testing the validity
of Dr. Naylor's work.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.747
Innovations in criminology

21:27.780 --> 21:29.475
are always interesting to me.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.511
The late doctor was either
a genius or a fool,

21:31.550 --> 21:32.983
and I'm curious
to know which one.

21:33.020 --> 21:36.012
Moldy crabapple,
found on the street.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.620
Drain hair.

21:39.660 --> 21:40.957
Ooh, you also better have

21:41.000 --> 21:43.628
a gallon of bleach
in that box.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.969
Soiled sock found beneath
a bench in a holding cell.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.331
I'd like to know

21:48.370 --> 21:49.394
which of these items

21:49.440 --> 21:50.702
you'd be willing to eat.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.628
(grunts)
If you had to.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.103
In fact,
I'd like you to rank them

21:54.140 --> 21:55.437
in the order in which you'd be
willing to eat them.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.107
Listen to your gut.

21:57.140 --> 22:00.303
My gut is telling me very loudly
not to play this game.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.584
(sighs)

22:06.620 --> 22:08.986
I guess I could cut the mold

22:09.020 --> 22:11.386
off the crabapple,
wash it really well,

22:11.430 --> 22:12.829
and technically...

22:12.860 --> 22:15.420
the cockroach is edible,
if I cook it...

22:15.460 --> 22:17.098
I mean, do I seriously
have to keep going on?

22:17.130 --> 22:18.597
No.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.097
Your willingness to
choose even two items

22:20.130 --> 22:21.939
suggests that the late
doctor was onto something.

22:21.970 --> 22:23.858
Explain that.

22:23.910 --> 22:24.899
Imagine you're a judge.

22:24.940 --> 22:26.066
You're having to sentence

22:26.110 --> 22:27.998
a child pornographer on one day,

22:28.040 --> 22:29.769
and a man who imprisoned women
in his basement the next.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.903
Both defendants
turn your stomach.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.872
But does giving one
more prison time

22:33.920 --> 22:36.445
imply that the other
deserves less?

22:36.480 --> 22:37.845
Enter DANTE,

22:37.890 --> 22:42.418
the Depravity and Atrocity
Numeration Test.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.428
It's an online survey,

22:44.460 --> 22:47.793
which asks its subjects
to score a series of statements,

22:47.830 --> 22:50.663
from a scale of "strongly agree"

22:50.700 --> 22:52.622
through to "strongly disagree."

22:52.670 --> 22:54.661
"Killing to protect a loved one
is understandable,

22:54.700 --> 22:56.691
even if the act is
premeditated."

22:56.740 --> 22:58.765
"Taking pleasure in torture

22:58.810 --> 23:00.869
is even worse than murder."

23:00.910 --> 23:02.468
I think taking this test
would be torture.

23:02.510 --> 23:03.704
It is a little macabre.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.172
People take it voluntarily?

23:05.210 --> 23:07.041
So far, they have done
by the thousands,

23:07.080 --> 23:08.945
_and in a dozen
different countries.

23:08.980 --> 23:12.040
My question is whether the
results held any actual meaning.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.512
Despite your revulsion,

23:13.560 --> 23:15.448
and, I assume,

23:15.490 --> 23:17.014
lack of experience eating
items such as these,

23:17.060 --> 23:19.051
you were able to place them
in an intelligent order.

23:19.090 --> 23:21.024
Now, Dr. Naylor reasoned

23:21.060 --> 23:23.096
that, via the wisdom
of the masses,

23:23.130 --> 23:25.098
the same could be done
for heinous crimes.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.530
She hoped that her data
would be used by the courts

23:27.570 --> 23:29.595
to create standardized
sentencmg guidelines.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.709
Do you think this had something
to do with why she was murdered?

23:33.740 --> 23:36.709
The study did earn Dr. Naylor
her share of detractors.

23:36.740 --> 23:40.676
Wealth and race presently play
a far greater role in sentencing

23:40.720 --> 23:42.017
than anyone would care to admit.

23:42.050 --> 23:43.813
Now, any attempt
to change that,

23:43.850 --> 23:46.717
represents a seismic upsetting
of the applecart,

23:46.750 --> 23:49.184
and it's easy to imagine any
number of father's cronies

23:49.220 --> 23:52.451
liking the applecart
just the way it is.

23:52.490 --> 23:53.627
(doorbell ringing)

23:53.660 --> 23:55.093
Are you expecting anyone?

23:55.130 --> 23:56.620
No.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.061
Um...

24:00.100 --> 24:02.136
you f...
you forgot your drain hair!

24:04.610 --> 24:05.929
You and your colleagues believe

24:05.970 --> 24:08.734
that I am guilty
of Emil's murder.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.873
You asked for access
to his work.

24:10.910 --> 24:11.979
I've decided to give it to you.

24:12.010 --> 24:14.149
Thank you, gentlemen.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.818
Please wait outside.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.515
What is all this?

24:18.550 --> 24:20.689
Emil's computer,
phone records,

24:20.720 --> 24:24.520
uh, copies of every contract
he's been working on.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.028
Every e-mail
for the last three months.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.153
Going back long
before I asked you

24:29.200 --> 24:30.861
to uncover a mole.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.562
And long before
you obviously uncovered Emil.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.261
You admit you knew about him.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.029
Eventually, yes.

24:37.070 --> 24:40.676
I confirmed his
treachery last week.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.074
I didn't surmise yours
until this morning.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.613
You had to had
known about Emil.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.572
You had to have
told your Captain.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.087
Otherwise, why would he think

24:51.120 --> 24:54.715
that I was responsible
for multiple murders?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.887
HOLMES:
Kurtz told Watson you'd moved
him on to another project.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.650
To restrict his_ access to
senSItive information, I assume.

24:59.690 --> 25:01.055
It was.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.864
So I could feed him
misinformation;

25:03.900 --> 25:06.266
information that would
expose its reCIpients

25:06.300 --> 25:08.234
and give me an advantage.

25:08.270 --> 25:10.966
You're suggesting you were
involved in a long game,

25:11.010 --> 25:13.228
one that required you to keep
Emil Kurtz alive.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.101
You think that's going
to prove your innocence?

25:15.140 --> 25:18.041
No.

25:18.080 --> 25:22.619
I think..._ this will
prove my innocence.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.288
I learned _
from your captain

25:24.320 --> 25:26.288
that Emil's death
was a paid hit.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.810
Now, unlike you,

25:27.860 --> 25:30.784
I know that
I did not order it.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.559
And so I began to go back

25:32.590 --> 25:34.694
through his files myself,
to see who may have.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.823
When I first started
looking into it,

25:36.860 --> 25:39.863
Emil was feeding information
about an oil deal to someone.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.789
They were exchanging e-mails
with encoded messages.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.331
If this e-mail is real,
it came from the same server.

25:45.370 --> 25:46.860
Oh, more than that.

25:46.910 --> 25:49.834
It came just hours
before Emil died.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.804
Read the decrypted version,
you'll see.

25:52.850 --> 25:57.742
Emil was instructed to go to
that luncheonette yesterday.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.849
We'll have to authenticate it.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.289
But if this is real,

26:01.320 --> 26:03.151
if it says
what you say it does...

26:03.190 --> 26:06.023
Then I didn't send Emil Kurtz
to his death.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.828
The people
he was spying for did.

26:24.110 --> 26:26.670
MORLAND:
What? No police?

26:26.710 --> 26:30.316
No paddy wagon outside?

26:30.350 --> 26:33.285
Would cautious optimism
be in order?

26:33.320 --> 26:34.958
You may recall,

26:34.990 --> 26:37.686
I have contacts inside
a hacker collective.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.153
They were able to authenticate
the e-mail that you brought us,

26:40.190 --> 26:42.192
and confirm that it was sent
from the same account

26:42.230 --> 26:43.993
Watson flagged weeks ago.

26:44.030 --> 26:47.363
They were not able to identify
the owner of that account,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.334
but since I doubt even a man
as Machiavellian as you

26:49.370 --> 26:51.008
would have lured Kurtz
into spying on him

26:51.040 --> 26:53.065
only to kill him later,

26:53.110 --> 26:55.032
it would appear
to support your innocence.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.173
You seem displeased.

26:57.210 --> 26:59.770
With myself.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.244
I often say detection
should be an exact science.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.142
Otherwise, one tends to twist
facts to suit theories,

27:07.190 --> 27:08.657
instead of theories
to suit facts.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.829
That sounded like an apology.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.893
(quiet laugh)

27:13.930 --> 27:16.728
You like to see me as a villain.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.796
You did not
commit these murders.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.320
Your general nature's
not in dispute.

27:21.970 --> 27:24.734
Anyway, thanks to you,

27:24.770 --> 27:26.806
we now know more
than we did a day ago

27:26.840 --> 27:29.229
about whoever was behind
Emil Kurtz's murder.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.976
And by extension,
Dr. Naylor's.

27:32.010 --> 27:34.444
It was the same individual
Kurtz was feeding information to

27:34.480 --> 27:36.141
during your Colombian oil deal.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.910
Given the timing
of his murder,

27:38.950 --> 27:41.316
they may have become aware
that he was compromised,

27:41.360 --> 27:43.248
and decided to tie up
a loose end.

27:43.290 --> 27:47.283
And now you want to know to whom
did I lose the oil deal?

27:49.260 --> 27:51.364
Come.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.335
This is a matter better
discussed behind closed doors.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.831
Watson mentioned
she found you

28:01.210 --> 28:03.007
Unannounced.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.474
I've been meaning
to apologize.

28:05.510 --> 28:08.217
It was clear that
my presence startled her.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.343
Said you were rather cryptic

28:10.380 --> 28:11.916
about your reasons
for being there.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.247
Nothing untoward.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.212
I was simply looking for an item

28:15.260 --> 28:17.888
that I had lost track of.

28:17.930 --> 28:22.253
Years ago, I had brought an
antique ring over from London.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.360
It was intended as a gift
for the Countess of Morcar.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.220
I may be visiting
the countess shortly,

28:27.270 --> 28:28.794
so I remembered the ring.

28:30.370 --> 28:31.803
You haven't seen it, have you?

28:33.470 --> 28:34.402
Ah.

28:37.240 --> 28:40.915
The follow-up after
the Colombian oil deal.

28:40.950 --> 28:44.078
Lyndon Rove.

28:44.120 --> 28:48.056
CEO at, that time,
of RNJ Petrochemical.

28:48.090 --> 28:50.388
The company
that won the contract.

28:50.420 --> 28:52.820
So this is your
opposition research on him?

28:52.860 --> 28:54.122
Your intelligence

28:54.160 --> 28:56.526
on where his bodies
are buried?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.926
He's a sex tourist.

28:58.970 --> 29:02.394
There are corners of this Earth
where a man of means

29:02.440 --> 29:05.261
can satisfy
any appetites he has;

29:05.310 --> 29:08.871
appetites that a decent man
would find vile.

29:08.910 --> 29:11.208
So I take it you acted
on this intelligence?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.274
Threatened to expose him?

29:12.310 --> 29:14.449
I used it to pressure Rove

29:14.480 --> 29:17.074
into revealing
the identity of the spy.

29:17.120 --> 29:21.159
He swore that no one at RNJ
knew who the mole was.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.112
He admitted receiving the files,

29:23.160 --> 29:26.482
but insisted that they had come
to his people anonymously,

29:26.530 --> 29:28.998
and that they had
merely acted upon them.

29:29.030 --> 29:30.224
You believed him?

29:30.260 --> 29:32.228
Not at first,

29:32.270 --> 29:35.433
but eventually I gave him
an ultimatum,

29:35.470 --> 29:39.861
promising to disclose
his deviancy to RNJ's board.

29:39.910 --> 29:43.437
He resigned his position before
I could make good on my threat.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.345
Unlikely he would have
thrown himself on his sword,

29:45.380 --> 29:47.541
if he could have
given up Kurtz instead.

29:47.580 --> 29:50.572
So who else profited
when RNJ won the deal?

29:50.620 --> 29:53.043
Quite a few people.

29:53.090 --> 29:55.558
And, thus far,
my attempts to identify

29:55.590 --> 29:58.150
who employed Emil
have failed.

29:58.190 --> 30:00.249
Perhaps...

30:00.290 --> 30:02.895
we'd get greater results
working together.

30:06.470 --> 30:07.892
Hey, I got your text.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.191
You said there was something up

30:09.240 --> 30:10.537
with the shooter Arthur Tetch?

30:10.570 --> 30:13.232
Yeah. CCS was going
through Tetch's computer

30:13.270 --> 30:16.068
looking for anything that might
identify the guy who hired him.

30:16.110 --> 30:17.532
No luck with that.

30:17.580 --> 30:19.901
But they found
something else instead.

30:19.950 --> 30:22.316
Now, Tetch told us he'd
never heard of Dr. Naylor,

30:22.350 --> 30:26.218
or Emil Kurtz before his buddy
Mr. King hired him to kill them.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.582
Thing is, CCS found this.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.929
So, at least some of
what Arthur Tetch

30:30.960 --> 30:32.279
has been telling us
has been a lie.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.397
What am I looking at?

30:37.430 --> 30:39.068
Your Internet
browser history

30:39.100 --> 30:41.933
from about six months ago.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.631
Free country, right?

30:43.670 --> 30:45.228
You know, I actually didn't
produce any of this stuff.

30:45.270 --> 30:46.498
I just watched it.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.303
No, no. We don't care
about the porn.

30:48.340 --> 30:49.568
The only thing
we care about

30:49.610 --> 30:51.077
is the one
that's highlighted.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.408
WATSON: You told us
you never heard

30:53.450 --> 30:56.339
of Dr. Naylor until someone
hired you to kill her.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.608
But six months ago,
you took her online survey.

30:57.650 --> 30:59.015
That can't be a coincidence.

30:59.050 --> 31:00.586
You were looking
into her, right?

31:00.620 --> 31:02.349
BELL:
If you were,

31:02.390 --> 31:04.153
that would suggest you were
in touch with the people

31:04.190 --> 31:05.487
that wanted her
and Kurtz dead

31:05.530 --> 31:07.452
for a lot longer
than you told us.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.219
Your deal with
the DA's Office

31:09.260 --> 31:11.023
is based on your
full cooperation.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.628
We tell them you've been
holding back on us,

31:12.670 --> 31:14.399
the deal's out the window.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.568
I actually have no clue
what you're talking about.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.932
What online survey?

31:19.970 --> 31:22.109
Her project to rate
the severity of crimes.

31:22.140 --> 31:24.540
Whether people think that incest
is as bad as murder,

31:24.580 --> 31:26.468
or kidnapping
is worse than torture.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.375
Yeah. I-I remember that.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.512
Uh, the name is made up
of initials.

31:29.550 --> 31:30.915
Something like Dumbo.

31:30.950 --> 31:32.588
DANTE.

31:32.620 --> 31:35.487
Right.
I take online surveys.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.227
What do you call them,
clickbait?

31:38.260 --> 31:41.195
"What Game of Thrones
character are you?"

31:41.230 --> 31:42.629
I always get Joffrey.

31:42.660 --> 31:46.596
So you took
the DANTE survey for fun?

31:46.630 --> 31:47.597
Sure.

31:47.630 --> 31:48.961
It was interesting.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.467
A little long.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.900
Dr. Naylor had
something to do with it?

31:58.310 --> 32:01.245
(disco music blasting)

32:01.280 --> 32:03.942
* Turn the beat around...

32:03.990 --> 32:05.343
Sherlock!

32:05.390 --> 32:06.618
Oh, good timing.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.584
Just finishing
the last questions.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.315
(turning volume down)
Then you can
review my answers,

32:10.360 --> 32:12.282
and see if you agree
on a new theory.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.491
WATSON: You're taking
Dr. Naylor's survey?

32:14.530 --> 32:15.622
Why would you do
that to yourself?

32:15.660 --> 32:18.094
And why are you
listening to disco?

32:18.130 --> 32:20.018
I'm taking the test because
you said Arthur Tetch took it.

32:20.070 --> 32:21.560
I'm listening to upbeat music
because taking the test

32:21.600 --> 32:22.669
is analogous to
eating drain hair.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.133
I came across this song

32:24.170 --> 32:25.535
and the lyrics
seem fitting

32:25.570 --> 32:28.209
for reasons that
Will become clear.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.502
I take it you
learned something

32:29.540 --> 32:30.734
when you went
to see your father.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.202
As part of our efforts
to determine

32:32.250 --> 32:33.501
who profited from the
Colombian oil deal,

32:33.550 --> 32:34.676
_ we reviewed
finanCIal records

32:34.720 --> 32:36.210
from the day that
it was announced.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.514
As it turns out,
a great deal of money

32:38.550 --> 32:41.485
was made in
Colombian oil that day...

32:41.520 --> 32:43.283
fueled by a coinciding event.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.185
I remember this.

32:45.230 --> 32:48.051
There was a bomb scare at
an OPEC meeting in Geneva.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.499
Suicide bomber tried to get
into the conference room.

32:49.530 --> 32:50.724
This happened on the same day?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.318
The bomber was killed
at the scene.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.496
No one else was harmed.

32:53.530 --> 32:54.690
But the incident
sent representatives

32:54.740 --> 32:57.629
from 13 of the world's
oil-exporting nations

32:57.670 --> 32:59.331
into temporary lockdown.

32:59.370 --> 33:01.429
And, for that one day,

33:01.480 --> 33:03.038
_ it also sent
Oil-related investments,

33:03.080 --> 33:06.709
in countries not part
of OPEC, through the roof.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.469
Colombia: Not part of OPEC.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.512
So you think someone
orchestrated the attack.

33:12.550 --> 33:13.778
Morland's rival bidder?

33:13.820 --> 33:16.357
It appears that they
were pawns as well.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.187
I believe that
a third party

33:18.230 --> 33:20.585
_ harnessed the _oldest
investment strategy in the book:

33:20.630 --> 33:22.222
Buy low; sell high.

33:22.260 --> 33:23.727
Step one, buy low:

33:23.760 --> 33:25.796
Invest in a company which
is poised to lose

33:25.830 --> 33:28.037
a valuable oil contract.

33:28.070 --> 33:31.039
Step two, with the help of
a mole inside Father's ranks,

33:31.070 --> 33:33.459
manipulate events so that
said company wins the bid.

33:33.510 --> 33:34.636
Step three:
Create a bomb scare,

33:34.680 --> 33:36.534
skyrocketing
Colombian oil futures,

33:36.580 --> 33:38.207
and the winning company's
stock with them.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.138
Sell high. I get that.
But what does this have to do

33:40.180 --> 33:42.045
with disco,
and the DANTE survey?

33:42.080 --> 33:43.047
If you're let me finish.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.388
If I'm right,

33:44.420 --> 33:46.581
whoever controlled
Emil Kurtz and his killer,

33:46.620 --> 33:48.656
also controlled
the Geneva bomber.

33:48.690 --> 33:51.158
I reached out to
a friend at Interpol,

33:51.190 --> 33:54.091
and I did what our own CCS did
with regards to Arthur Tetch.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.496
I requested the bomber's
Internet search history,

33:56.530 --> 33:59.829
hoping that it might lead
to his employer.

33:59.870 --> 34:01.360
So the bomber
took the survey, too.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.765
Okay, now I'm lost.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.233
Obviously, this is
not a coincidence,

34:04.270 --> 34:05.498
even though Tetch
thought it was.

34:05.540 --> 34:06.700
What do you think is going on?

34:06.740 --> 34:09.129
Dr. Naylor created the survey

34:09.180 --> 34:11.478
to collect our common responses
to heinous crimes.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.171
But it occurred to me,

34:13.210 --> 34:14.677
if one were to invert
the arrangement of data,

34:14.720 --> 34:16.415
turn it upside down,

34:16.450 --> 34:19.146
one could instead identify
outlier respondents--

34:19.190 --> 34:20.782
people who don't share
polite society's judgments

34:20.820 --> 34:22.549
about torture and murder.

34:22.590 --> 34:25.081
People who lack empathy.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.529
Both Tetch and the
bomber took the test,

34:26.560 --> 34:28.152
and seeing their results,

34:28.200 --> 34:30.589
someone hired them
to be killers.

34:30.630 --> 34:32.166
Someone is using
the DANTE survey

34:32.200 --> 34:34.691
to identify
and recruit psychopaths.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.571
(scraping)

34:51.250 --> 34:53.343
(rustling)

35:10.670 --> 35:13.537
WATSON: Hey, Marcus called
a little while ago.

35:13.570 --> 35:17.279
He and a team
are executing the search.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.801
_ He'll let us know
if there's any news.

35:19.850 --> 35:21.272
Where did that come from?

35:23.880 --> 35:26.883
When you found my father
here the other night...

35:26.920 --> 35:29.855
he was looking for this
in our basement.

35:29.890 --> 35:32.620
He stored it there,
some years ago.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.925
He failed to find it
because I found it,

35:35.960 --> 35:38.895
shortly after I moved in.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.803
It's beautiful.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.502
I didn't realize your father
used our house for storage.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.644
Yes, he has, on occasion.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.945
When he wants to keep something
out of sight and mind.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.470
Me, for example.

35:59.450 --> 36:02.556
This ring belonged to my mother.

36:04.760 --> 36:09.595
Always struck me as odd that
he ever held onto it at all.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.962
I never had him pegged
as the sentimental type.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.595
As it turns out, he isn't.

That's the nice thing about
jewelry, gemstones.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.845
They're a very compact way of
smuggling money across a border,

36:25.880 --> 36:27.575
without leaving a paper trail.

36:27.610 --> 36:30.272
If, for instance,
one is dispensing bribes.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.678
You think he was going
to give it to someone

36:33.720 --> 36:36.314
who was going to help him
find Ruslan Krasnov.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.557
Or whoever hired Krasnov.

36:39.590 --> 36:44.368
He wishes to avenge the death of
his great love, Sabine Raoult.

36:46.970 --> 36:48.858
It's understandable
him choosing not to tell me

36:48.900 --> 36:50.663
that he wanted
Mother's ring for that.

36:53.340 --> 36:54.671
He did, however,

36:54.710 --> 36:57.702
recently find it fitting
to tell me...

36:57.740 --> 36:59.605
that she was an opiate addict.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.648
What do you mean?

37:04.920 --> 37:07.548
Well, she hid it from me.

37:07.590 --> 37:10.411
And then he hid it from me.

37:13.890 --> 37:15.619
That's pretty huge.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.597
Are you all right?

37:20.900 --> 37:24.859
Biology dictates reality.

37:24.910 --> 37:29.734
On the one hand, it helps me
blame myself less for what I am.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.499
The first and oft-repeated
step of the program

37:32.550 --> 37:34.370
is admitting
one's powerlessness.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.308
I'm not responsible
for her drug use,

37:36.350 --> 37:37.817
nor for any of the proclivities

37:37.850 --> 37:39.715
I may have inherited from her.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.310
On the other hand,

37:42.360 --> 37:45.727
I really am no fan of abdicating
personal responsibility.

37:47.890 --> 37:52.361
Hence the repetition
of the step.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.858
Are you going to give
your father the ring?

37:58.940 --> 38:00.999
So that he can give it
to some corrupt official

38:01.040 --> 38:03.577
who may have some
specious information to sell?

38:06.510 --> 38:08.341
Eh...

38:08.380 --> 38:10.416
I think he can find
some other means.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.786
He usually does.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.708
(cell phone chimes twice)

38:24.100 --> 38:26.796
Thanks for coming down,
Dr. Warren.

38:26.830 --> 38:28.934
We were hoping you could
answer a handful of questions

38:28.970 --> 38:30.961
that have come up about
Dr. Naylor and her work.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.605
It could be a big help
to the investigation.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.471
Sure. IfI can.

38:35.510 --> 38:37.978
They're all written down,
so if you don't mind,

38:38.010 --> 38:39.079
maybe we could just
go through them together.

38:39.110 --> 38:40.509
That sound all right?

38:40.550 --> 38:42.347
Yeah.

38:45.650 --> 38:47.743
I don't understand.

38:47.790 --> 38:48.984
This is the DANTE survey.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.419
Yeah, we were wondering,

38:50.460 --> 38:51.825
have you ever taken
the test yourself?

38:51.860 --> 38:54.988
Dr. Naylor never allowed it.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.952
She didn't think anyone
on the team should take it.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.992
She felt our responses would be
biased, and throw off the data.

39:00.030 --> 39:01.588
HOLMES:
A reasonable concern.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.360
Nonetheless, I'll be interested
to know your responses.

39:05.410 --> 39:06.809
To know what you thought
was worse:

39:06.840 --> 39:08.535
Murder for money?

39:08.580 --> 39:10.502
Deliberately sending someone
into harm's way?

39:10.540 --> 39:12.440
Eliciting others
to participate?

39:12.480 --> 39:14.710
Your answers will be
particularly worthy of study,

39:14.750 --> 39:17.719
because you've committed so many
of the crimes on the list.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.718
WATSON: This morning, you
and your team were told

39:19.750 --> 39:22.389
the computer lab was closed,
due to a maintenance issue.

39:22.420 --> 39:24.627
The truth is, police were
examining your computer.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.855
They confirmed that
someone has been isolating

39:26.890 --> 39:29.120
psychopathic responses
to the survey,

39:29.160 --> 39:32.061
and then sharing the IP
addresses of those respondents.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.637
BELL:
We know it was you.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.467
You tried to hide it,

39:36.500 --> 39:38.036
changing up the log-in names
and passwords you used,

39:38.070 --> 39:40.630
but when we compared the times
of the messages you sent

39:40.670 --> 39:42.706
with the schedules
of all the other lab assistants,

39:42.740 --> 39:45.049
you were the only one
who was free every time.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.709
That got us a warrant
to pull your bank records.

39:48.750 --> 39:49.876
You received a payment

39:49.920 --> 39:51.581
every time you sent a new lead.

39:51.620 --> 39:54.612
We counted six payments
for six psychopaths.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.082
HOLMES:
We also found a recent

39:56.120 --> 39:57.985
message you sent,
in which you informed

39:58.020 --> 40:00.454
your mysterious benefactor
that you thought Dr. Naylor

40:00.490 --> 40:02.993
was growing suspicious
of your activities.

40:03.030 --> 40:06.761
That message directly
preceded Dr. Naylor's murder.

40:09.070 --> 40:11.061
(suppressed crying)

40:13.040 --> 40:14.132
(voice trembling):
I'm sorry.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.775
Then help us.

40:16.810 --> 40:18.573
You'll be helping yourself, too.

40:18.610 --> 40:21.647
Two of the six psychopaths
we already know about.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.477
The other four we're
working on identifying

40:23.520 --> 40:25.943
off their IP addresses.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.584
What we need from you
is the name of the person

40:28.620 --> 40:30.611
you are sending information to.

40:30.660 --> 40:34.118
The person that wanted to hire
these people to commit crimes.

40:34.160 --> 40:38.859
Right now, all we have is
an anonymous e-mail account.

40:38.900 --> 40:41.630
What can you
tell us about it?

40:44.640 --> 40:47.029
About nine months ago,

40:47.070 --> 40:48.970
a man approached me
outside of the school.

40:49.010 --> 40:52.878
He showed me an ID.
that looked real,

40:52.910 --> 40:55.014
and said he worked for
the CIA... (crying quietly)

40:58.120 --> 40:59.883
He told me what they wanted,

40:59.920 --> 41:01.808
and said I would be
helping recruit people

41:01.860 --> 41:04.010
to do special missions.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.528
By the time I connected
what I was doing

41:06.560 --> 41:08.494
with what I saw on the news,

41:08.530 --> 41:09.792
I was in too deep,

41:09.830 --> 41:11.559
and scared to stop.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.625
And you liked the money.

41:13.670 --> 41:15.888
BELL:
Any chance the name

41:15.940 --> 41:18.090
of this CIA agent was Mr. King?

41:18.140 --> 41:21.871
No. It wasn't King.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.104
It was Agent Babbage.

41:24.650 --> 41:25.674
Babbage.

41:25.710 --> 41:28.076
Yeah.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.975
Why?

41:30.020 --> 41:32.181
Excuse me. A moment?

41:43.930 --> 41:44.794
What was that all about?

41:44.830 --> 41:46.559
Are you all right?

41:46.600 --> 41:48.192
In here.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.861
I don't know why
I didn't see it sooner.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.104
See what?

41:54.140 --> 41:55.107
The hiring of psychopaths.

41:55.140 --> 41:56.209
The machinations.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.730
The manipulation
of world events.

41:57.780 --> 41:58.974
The name King,
that's common enough,

41:59.010 --> 42:00.045
but Babbage,
that gave it away.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.809
Joshua King,
Charles Babbage,

42:01.850 --> 42:04.842
they're both Lucasian Chairs
of Mathematics at Cambridge.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.289
I don't see
how that matters.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.754
'Cause it's a pattern
I've seen before.

42:08.790 --> 42:10.212
It's a gag she used
to name her operatives

42:10.260 --> 42:11.818
for her own amusement.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.021
She used for her amusement?

42:14.060 --> 42:16.221
We've dealt with this
organization before, Watson.

42:16.260 --> 42:17.989
It was run by Moriarty.
