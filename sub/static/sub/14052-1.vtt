WEBVTT

00:24.000 --> 00:25.720
Here we go, gang!

00:25.760 --> 00:27.600
A little Kir Royale.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.120
-Lovely! -Well, here we are!

00:37.720 --> 00:39.080
Hello, everyone! Erm...

00:39.120 --> 00:40.880
ROGER: Oh, here he is!

00:40.920 --> 00:44.480
Sorry, the, erm, well, the door was open,

00:40.920 --> 00:44.480
so I just, so I let myself in.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.080
Well, this is fun!

00:53.360 --> 00:55.280
But it's possible.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
Right?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.160
He could be having a...

01:00.200 --> 01:03.000
You know, a good time.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.000
At a party?

01:05.040 --> 01:08.520
Mmm. Ah! Right then, Rich. What are you drinking?

01:11.960 --> 01:13.720
Any chance of a cup of tea or...

01:15.000 --> 01:16.360
I'll get you one.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.440
Thank you.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.680
Put a sparkler in it, Sasha.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.280
FIDEL: <i> But it's a reunion!</i>

01:21.920 --> 01:23.000
So?

01:23.040 --> 01:24.840
-So it's his old college friends.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.960
And they'll be talking about the good old days, you know?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.040
When they were young and crazy and, and, and...

01:31.080 --> 01:34.640
DWAYNE: <i> And what?</i> FIDEL: <i> And the stuff they did</i>

01:31.080 --> 01:34.640
<i>and the fun they had.</i>

01:43.840 --> 01:45.280
I really can't believe you're here.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.880
Sorry, could you excuse me, just for a moment?

01:57.080 --> 01:59.960
DWAYNE: <i> We could go up there</i> <i>and rescue him.</i>

01:57.080 --> 01:59.960
CAMILLE: <i> How?</i>

02:00.000 --> 02:03.360
Drive up there and say there's an emergency.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.440
Tell him that we found his sense of humour.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.400
SASHA: <i> I know, everyone!</i>

02:12.600 --> 02:15.240
Richard? Let's all play charades!

02:15.280 --> 02:17.080
-Yeah! -I'll get a paper and pen.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.160
Actually, I've, erm, I've got a bit of a headache

02:17.120 --> 02:21.160
coming on.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.280
I think I'm going to just stop out here.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.360
Oh, come on, RP! Don't be such a bore!

02:25.400 --> 02:27.120
Come on, man. You can't sit

02:25.400 --> 02:27.120
outside all day.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.240
Dinner

02:39.880 --> 02:41.480
Erm, consume?

02:41.520 --> 02:42.840
SASHA: Mud?

02:42.880 --> 02:43.880
Some brown...

02:43.920 --> 02:45.440
Hill  Scoff?

02:45.480 --> 02:47.240
Look, you're never going to get it.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.160
Angie's brain isn't wired the same as ours, is it,

02:47.280 --> 02:49.160
me old duck?

02:50.200 --> 02:51.480
-Look!

02:51.520 --> 02:52.720
-ROGER: Cutting... -I'm...

02:52.760 --> 02:54.440
Er, er, mound

02:54.480 --> 02:56.080
Jamie's right. Ange, Ange, what is it?

02:56.120 --> 02:58.000
It's a pie!

02:59.680 --> 03:01.720
That bit was the lid of the pie, the pie lid,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.720
the pastry pie lid!

03:01.760 --> 03:03.400
Which film is pie?

03:03.440 --> 03:05.800
<i>-Life of Pi.</i> I got it 10 minutes ago.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.800
-Oh!

03:05.840 --> 03:08.360
Then why didn't you say something?

03:08.400 --> 03:11.120
And miss you swinging your arms around

03:08.400 --> 03:11.120
like a demented windmill?

03:11.160 --> 03:12.880
That was far more amusing.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.600
Thank you, Ange, but that is quite enough

03:12.920 --> 03:16.600
charades for me.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.680
Got a good mind to join old misery guts

03:16.640 --> 03:19.680
on the veranda there.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.200
He's been out there for an hour.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.680
He never liked party games.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.720
But still, it's not much of a reunion, is it?

03:24.760 --> 03:27.280
Even for RP, sitting on your own,

03:24.760 --> 03:27.280
reading a damn book!

03:28.520 --> 03:30.720
Come on! Who wants a cocktail?

03:30.760 --> 03:33.160
Ooh, I don't think I should. They're so strong.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.840
For Christ's sake, Ange! Lighten up!

03:34.880 --> 03:38.120
Come on, Ange! We owe it to our younger selves

03:34.880 --> 03:38.120
to get totally wrecked.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.120
What about Richard? He's missing all the fun.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.800
Nothing new there, then.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.080
Look, we've, we've taken him out

03:41.840 --> 03:45.080
some food and some drink.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.440
He'll be fine.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.160
-Do your worst, barman! -Certainly shall.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.480
Roger's making more cocktails. Would you like one?

03:50.520 --> 03:52.120
Mmm!

03:52.160 --> 03:53.960
Where's the ice pick? It was here a second ago.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
Richard?

04:59.760 --> 05:02.920
No, we still don't know when the body

04:59.760 --> 05:02.920
will be released.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.920
No, no, no, no. Of course not.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.920
And we will.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.320
I promise. Okay, bye.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.720
His parents

05:20.440 --> 05:22.400
Nothing from the door-to-door.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.560
And no one could have approached by car

05:22.440 --> 05:24.560
because I checked the traffic

05:24.600 --> 05:27.920
CCTV camera at the bottom of the hill,

05:24.600 --> 05:27.920
which leads up to the house.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.400
We've got the chief's cab going up there at 4:50 p.m.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.920
and then coming back down empty 10 minutes later.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.000
The next car to go up there was ours.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.720
What about you guys?

05:36.760 --> 05:39.120
I'm going through the chief's current caseload.

05:36.760 --> 05:39.120
Nothing so far.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.720
And I'm still trying to see who's just been

05:39.160 --> 05:41.720
released from prison.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.800
Prison We're wasting our time!

05:44.840 --> 05:46.640
-I'm telling you.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.720
There's no way the killer was an intruder from outside.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.120
Come on! We've all seen that villa.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.240
The whole place is perched on

05:52.160 --> 05:54.240
the edge of a cliff.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.480
The only way out onto that veranda is

05:54.280 --> 05:57.480
from inside the house.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.760
Okay! So we're back where we started again.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.760
-Yes! -The four people

05:59.800 --> 06:02.760
already at the house.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.840
University friends he hadn't seen in 25 years.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.400
Makes no sense.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.280
Good morning, team.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.880
So, I imagine it's difficult to think straight

06:14.280 --> 06:18.880
in the circumstances.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.600
A little, sir. Yes.

06:22.640 --> 06:27.080
It, erm, it occurred to me that you may need

06:22.640 --> 06:27.080
a little help.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.720
Any extra officers you can get over here...

06:33.320 --> 06:35.880
How about just one to begin with?

06:45.280 --> 06:46.840
Your new inspector.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.920
London speaks very highly of him.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.040
-Hello! -Hello!

07:13.920 --> 07:16.200
Morning. Commissioner.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.160
Morning.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.440
Well, at least I think it's morning. Are we in front

07:20.200 --> 07:23.440
or behind here?

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
Er, anyway, sorry if I'm late.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.520
Or early.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.320
-Thank you. -Team, may I introduce

07:30.360 --> 07:32.920
Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman.

07:38.840 --> 07:42.320
Dwayne, Fidel. Help the inspector

07:38.840 --> 07:42.320
in with his luggage.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.600
-Yes, sir. -Thank you.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.680
This is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.440
It's a real pleasure to meet you,

07:55.480 --> 07:57.960
although I'm sorry it's not in better circumstances.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.800
This must be a terrible time for you all.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.400
Yes, it is.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.560
Sergeant Fidel Best and Officer Dwayne Myers.

08:05.600 --> 08:09.720
Sergeant Bordey, perhaps you will bring

08:05.600 --> 08:09.720
the inspector up to speed?

08:09.760 --> 08:10.800
Sir, it...

08:14.160 --> 08:16.360
Yes, sir.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.760
Inspector, if there's anything

08:16.400 --> 08:19.760
you need...

08:19.800 --> 08:21.000
Thank you, sir.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.240
Sir.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.280
Commissioner.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.440
Right. Er, this is me, is it?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.600
Erm... Erm...

08:44.120 --> 08:45.960
Erm, actually...

08:50.320 --> 08:51.520
This'll be great.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.680
Yes. Lovely. So where are

09:16.320 --> 09:18.120
these friends now?

09:18.160 --> 09:21.120
We moved them to a local hotel so we could preserve

09:18.160 --> 09:21.120
the crime scene.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.200
Excellent.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.120
Okay. So we have Angela Birkett.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.200
She's a lawyer currently living in Bristol. Unmarried.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.760
Then we have husband and wife James and Sasha Moore.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.080
He's a financial advisor,

09:31.120 --> 09:32.880
and she ran her own computer software company.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.680
"Ran", past tense?

09:34.720 --> 09:37.000
Yes. She sold the company seven years ago

09:34.720 --> 09:37.000
for a small fortune.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.960
And finally, we have Roger Sadler.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.840
Here alone, but married with three children.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.840
He's an estate agent.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.600
They all arrived on the island five days ago.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.800
-Yes, sir.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.440
And you found the body where?

09:58.440 --> 09:59.560
Hot, isn't it?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.760
Could you bear to talk me through it?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.040
Erm...

10:06.080 --> 10:08.000
The other guests were inside that room,

10:06.080 --> 10:08.000
playing games,

10:08.040 --> 10:09.640
according to their statements.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.200
Inspector Poole come out at 5:20 p.m. with a book,

10:09.680 --> 10:14.200
he sat here.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.960
<i></i> <i>-Yes, sir.</i>

10:17.960 --> 10:18.960
Right.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.640
About an hour later, Angela Birkett

10:20.840 --> 10:23.640
came outside to ask

10:23.680 --> 10:25.480
if he wanted a cocktail.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.320
<i>It was then that</i> <i>she found him,</i>

10:25.520 --> 10:28.320
<i>with an ice pick in his chest.</i>

10:28.360 --> 10:30.480
Okay. Forensics?

10:30.520 --> 10:33.440
The only prints we've managed to lift from the murder weapon

10:30.520 --> 10:33.440
all belong to the witnesses.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.600
-Yes, sir.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.400
They all used the ice pick at one time or another.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.520
Anything else?

10:39.560 --> 10:41.240
Yes, sir.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.600
We have an empty tea cup and an empty bowl with

10:41.280 --> 10:44.600
remnants of potato chips

10:44.640 --> 10:47.200
he was eating on the table.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.840
<i>And the book was on the floor,</i> <i>which is a bit of a puzzle.</i>

10:49.880 --> 10:50.920
How so?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.880
It was in French.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.440
-CAMILLE: No.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.440
Mmm.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.600
Right.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.440
HUMPHREY: You said they were playing games?

11:21.480 --> 11:23.480
Erm, yes. Charades.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.280
Cocktails there.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.960
Cocktails.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.120
So, Inspector Poole was pretty much in full view

11:27.000 --> 11:31.120
the whole time

11:31.160 --> 11:34.160
he was out there.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.080
And we're sure there's no other way out

11:34.200 --> 11:37.080
onto the veranda?

11:37.120 --> 11:38.920
Nope. You've got to come through the house.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.680
Ah. So in effect, any intruder would

11:38.960 --> 11:42.680
have had to pass

11:42.720 --> 11:45.480
the other guests as they played charades.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.120
Hmm.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
-DWAYNE: I did.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.440
Firstly to Sasha Moore, the lady in the blue...

12:04.000 --> 12:05.520
Where him gone?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Right?

12:17.160 --> 12:18.800
Yeah, I was just...

12:18.840 --> 12:20.000
Carry on.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.000
Okay, right. Erm...

12:24.040 --> 12:26.080
I, er...

12:26.120 --> 12:29.040
I'd like background checks on those, er, old friends.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.280
Financial checks?

12:31.320 --> 12:33.120
Yes.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.920
Good, excellent. Er, you can fill me in later.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.320
Right. I think it's time we spoke to Richard's

12:36.960 --> 12:40.320
old chums, don't you?

12:51.880 --> 12:52.920
Thank you.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.800
Oh, dear.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
Er...

13:06.640 --> 13:09.560
Am I seeing things or did he fall out of the window?

13:09.600 --> 13:10.920
Erm, yes.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.560
Yes, he did.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.280
The hotel is just around the headland.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.320
Right.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.640
Gosh, that takes some beating!

13:31.680 --> 13:32.720
What does?

13:33.520 --> 13:35.280
You're so beautiful.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.880
Sorry, it is so beautiful. Not you, you're not.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.880
God, no! It is.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.520
Beautiful. The sea and everything,

13:39.920 --> 13:43.520
palm trees,

13:43.560 --> 13:47.480
sand, the whole Caribbean vibe.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.480
Am I talking too much?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.720
-Yes. -Sorry. I do that a lot.

13:51.160 --> 13:55.080
It's the silence, you see. I always think it's my fault.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.680
Sally, my wife, says I have a pathological need to fill it.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.720
She's right, of course. She always is.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.880
She generally just puts a finger to my lips

14:00.760 --> 14:02.880
or says, "Shut up",

14:02.920 --> 14:05.480
you know, so feel free to... Either.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.240
-No.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.640
I'm not here to take his place,

14:14.360 --> 14:17.640
you know, Camille.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.440
I'm not here to be him.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.880
I don't expect anything, any consideration.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.880
I'm just here.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.800
And while I'm here, I promise I will do everything

14:27.800 --> 14:30.800
I can to find out

14:30.840 --> 14:32.160
what happened to your friend.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.560
Because that's what he was, not just your colleague.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.440
I'm sorry for your loss. I truly am.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.120
But the thing is,

14:41.720 --> 14:45.440
I have a feeling I may need some help,

14:41.720 --> 14:45.440
and a great deal of it.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.800
You can decide if you like me

14:45.480 --> 14:47.800
afterwards.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.960
And if I don't?

14:50.000 --> 14:53.520
Ah. Good point. Don't really have an answer for that.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.160
There's a whole list of things I'm not very good at.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.920
But I am a good detective.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.960
And right now, more than anything,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.400
I want to catch the person who murdered your friend.

15:12.440 --> 15:16.600
So maybe, just for now, it's enough that we both want

15:12.440 --> 15:16.600
the same thing.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.800
You're wet.

15:21.840 --> 15:22.880
Yes, I am.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.600
It will dry as we walk.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.920
Hello. Good morning.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.640
I'm sorry to put you through this again,

15:42.680 --> 15:45.720
but I'm DI Goodman. DS Bordey

15:42.680 --> 15:45.720
you already know.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.280
We just want to ask you a few more questions.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.560
Erm, when can we all go back to the villa?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.000
And you are?

15:51.040 --> 15:53.280
I'm James Moore. And this is

15:51.040 --> 15:53.280
my wife, Sasha.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.400
Er, the villa is, er, still a crime scene,

15:53.320 --> 15:56.400
I'm afraid.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.200
We're moving as quickly as we can.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.520
I don't want to go back there.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Angela?

16:02.040 --> 16:03.320
Roger Sadler.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.360
Look, erm, we've given our statements.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.720
I'm not sure what else we can tell you.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.760
I take it you're not suggesting

16:07.760 --> 16:10.760
we're involved in any way?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.720
We haven't ruled out anything yet.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.760
Come on! We haven't seen the man for 25 years.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.720
I mean, I know he wasn't everyone's cup of tea,

16:17.760 --> 16:19.840
but why would any of us want him dead?

16:19.880 --> 16:21.440
We didn't even know he was on the island.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.040
But I thought this was a reunion.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.200
Yes, it is. Erm, well, we always said

16:25.240 --> 16:28.280
we'd do a little something for our 25th anniversary.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.880
So why wasn't DI Poole invited?

16:30.920 --> 16:35.200
Well, none of us have really kept in contact with Richard

16:30.920 --> 16:35.200
since university, really.

16:35.240 --> 16:39.120
ROGER: <i> Until, that is,</i> <i>we were in your local market</i>

16:35.240 --> 16:39.120
<i>the other day,</i>

16:39.160 --> 16:41.840
<i>and there he was.</i> <i>Richard bloody Poole!</i>

16:39.160 --> 16:41.840
<i>I mean...</i>

16:46.600 --> 16:48.200
What are you all doing here?

16:49.120 --> 16:50.680
What an amazing coincidence.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.440
Yes! Wasn't it?

16:52.480 --> 16:55.200
Erm, then could I ask, er...

16:58.520 --> 17:00.920
-I, I did.

17:03.240 --> 17:06.360
And, erm, out of all the possible

17:03.240 --> 17:06.360
holiday destinations

17:06.400 --> 17:09.840
in the world, why on earth did you choose Saint

17:09.880 --> 17:14.040
Someone mentioned it to me when I was trying

17:09.880 --> 17:14.040
to set up the reunion.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.440
Was it you, James? You'd been here

17:14.080 --> 17:17.440
on a golf trip?

17:17.480 --> 17:20.200
Me? No. God, no. No, I'd, I'd never heard of this place.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.520
Oh, it must have been you, then, Sasha.

17:21.560 --> 17:25.480
Didn't you say you had your cosmetic surgery here?

17:25.520 --> 17:28.160
No, that was Saint Lucia, darling.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.480
And please don't give up a girl's secrets.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.240
Do you know what? I must've read about it, then,

17:31.280 --> 17:32.840
in a holiday supplement or something.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.680
Anyway, it stuck in my mind for some reason, so...

17:38.080 --> 17:41.440
So you bumped into Richard, invited him to your villa?

17:41.480 --> 17:44.480
I mean, it was a reunion we were having and, well,

17:41.480 --> 17:44.480
we didn't know he was here,

17:44.520 --> 17:47.280
but once we did, well... Well, how could we not?

17:47.320 --> 17:49.000
Indeed.

17:49.040 --> 17:53.120
So how come he ended up sitting alone on the veranda?

17:53.160 --> 17:57.920
It's no mystery. We wanted to play charades and he didn't.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.440
-Got a bit of a headache. -Oh, come on, RP,

17:57.960 --> 18:01.440
don't be such a bore!

18:01.480 --> 18:04.440
HUMPHREY: <i> And then over</i> <i>the next hour,</i>

18:01.480 --> 18:04.440
<i>I understand that, erm,</i>

18:04.480 --> 18:07.040
<i>some of you went out</i> <i>to the veranda to see him.</i>

18:07.080 --> 18:09.480
ANGELA: <i> I went to check</i> <i>that he was all right.</i>

18:13.520 --> 18:16.360
<i>And he asked me</i> <i>for another cup of tea.</i>

18:16.400 --> 18:19.000
SASHA: <i> And then I think I took</i> <i>him out a bowl of crisps.</i>

18:19.040 --> 18:20.160
JAMES: <i> Then I took</i> <i>the tea out.</i>

18:20.200 --> 18:22.920
I'll just take the old boy this.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.080
HUMPHREY: <i> How long</i> <i>were you outside for?</i>

18:24.120 --> 18:26.240
Half a minute. Just delivered

18:24.120 --> 18:26.240
the tea, really.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.840
-Er, yes.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.560
I asked if he wanted to come and join the game.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.360
He, er, he said he'd rather not and, erm...

18:32.400 --> 18:34.000
And then I went back inside.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.320
I think I was probably the last one out there.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.960
<i>Yeah, I was doing</i> <i>the barbecue.</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
<i>I went out a couple of times</i> <i>to see if the coals were hot.</i>

18:40.040 --> 18:41.160
HUMPHREY: <i>Did you talk to Richard?</i>

18:41.200 --> 18:42.920
<i>No, no, I wasn't</i> <i>anywhere near him.</i>

18:42.960 --> 18:45.760
I was by the barbecue the whole, whole time.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.840
You know, the truth is, the rest of us were always

18:45.800 --> 18:49.840
in that main room.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.240
There must have been an intruder.

18:53.280 --> 18:58.560
Someone must have got into that area unnoticed, somehow.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.680
Despite the fact that you weren't expecting

19:02.960 --> 19:05.680
to meet him here,

19:05.720 --> 19:08.880
once you had, I take it you all got along okay?

19:08.920 --> 19:11.200
-Of course we did. -ROGER: Yes, yes.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.920
Okay. I think that's all for now.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.760
Thanks for your time.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.640
Oh, just one more thing.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.160
That book he was reading, where did that come from?

19:26.200 --> 19:28.920
He brought that with him. He showed it to you,

19:26.200 --> 19:28.920
didn't he, Sasha?

19:28.960 --> 19:32.160
Yes, that's right. Yeah. He, erm...

19:32.200 --> 19:36.120
He said he picked it up from a bookshop along the way.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.520
Strange thing to do, don't you think?

19:38.560 --> 19:41.080
-Well, not for Richard.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.320
Thank you.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.560
So the question is, what are the odds of booking

19:55.720 --> 19:59.560
a holiday 4,000 miles away,

19:59.600 --> 20:02.840
and a reunion, no less, and when you arrive,

20:02.880 --> 20:06.080
you discover someone you all happened to go

20:02.880 --> 20:06.080
to university with?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.240
Where are my notes?

20:08.280 --> 20:09.760
Ah! Thank you.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.880
So the point is,

20:13.920 --> 20:17.560
if any one of them knew Richard was

20:13.920 --> 20:17.560
in Saint-Marie,

20:17.600 --> 20:20.880
then it suggests that his murder was premeditated.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.160
They wouldn't have sent him if he didn't know

20:25.600 --> 20:28.160
what he was doing.

20:28.200 --> 20:31.400
Fidel, we're talking about a man who fell out

20:28.200 --> 20:31.400
of a window!

20:31.440 --> 20:32.840
Yes, but...

20:33.960 --> 20:36.200
Yes, that is true.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.200
Well, look. You weren't too keen on Inspector Poole

20:36.240 --> 20:39.200
when he came out either.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.880
We should just give him a chance.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.880
That's all I'm saying.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.200
Well, he's no chief, not in my book.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.080
Dwayne, no one is going to take the inspector's place.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.560
Not for me. And if he was here,

20:46.120 --> 20:48.560
I know what he'd say.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
Me too. "Turn up the air con."

20:51.480 --> 20:52.800
No.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.280
He'd tell us to be as professional as we can

20:55.320 --> 20:57.360
and to help the new inspector because that's why we're here.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.840
-We're police officers. -Mmm-hmm.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.200
-We can grieve in our own time.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.200
-Mmm-hmm.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.440
And the new guy's just as...

21:06.480 --> 21:08.680
I think we have to rule out an intruder.

21:08.720 --> 21:11.440
If someone had managed to reach the villa unseen

21:11.480 --> 21:15.400
and they also somehow managed to commit murder in plain view

21:11.480 --> 21:15.400
of four witnesses

21:15.440 --> 21:17.200
and then escape, I don't believe it.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.400
Agreed.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.840
So, we're left with four friends.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.640
Then if you haven't set eyes on someone for 25 years,

21:24.680 --> 21:26.280
how could you ever have a motive to kill them?

21:26.320 --> 21:28.160
Maybe they was all in it together.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.640
Possibly.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.640
But then I find the notion of four old university friends

21:32.680 --> 21:37.240
conspiring to travel all this way to murder someone

21:32.680 --> 21:37.240
after all this time,

21:37.280 --> 21:40.160
is just as unlikely as our ghostly intruder.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.320
Fox, goose and a bag of beans.

21:46.360 --> 21:51.600
-The puzzle!

21:46.360 --> 21:51.600
Fox, goose and a bag of beans.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.600
Once upon a time, a farmer went to

21:51.640 --> 21:54.600
a market and he bought a fox,

21:54.640 --> 21:56.400
a goose and a bag of beans.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.040
But to get them home, he had to cross

21:56.440 --> 21:59.040
a river by boat.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.080
But the boat was so small it would only carry him

22:02.120 --> 22:03.400
and one of the things he bought.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.360
If he took the beans, the fox would eat the goose.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.760
If he took the fox, the goose would eat the beans.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.200
So how did he get them all across the river?

22:12.720 --> 22:14.480
Yes. Now, in our version,

22:14.520 --> 22:17.880
Angela Birkett went out first to ask him

22:14.520 --> 22:17.880
if he needed anything.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.400
He asked for a cup of tea.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.760
Then Sasha took him out a bowl of crisps.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.440
So assuming that Sasha would have noticed

22:21.800 --> 22:25.440
him being dead,

22:25.480 --> 22:28.080
we therefore have to accept that Angela didn't kill him.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.520
Then the crisp bowl being empty

22:30.560 --> 22:34.440
clearly suggests that he was alive to eat them

22:30.560 --> 22:34.440
after Sasha had left.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.160
So we must assume that she didn't kill him either.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.960
Next out was her husband, James,

22:37.200 --> 22:40.960
who took him the cup of tea,

22:41.000 --> 22:45.080
which was also drunk, so that means James

22:41.000 --> 22:45.080
didn't kill him either.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.520
Unless Richard didn't drink the tea and the killer

22:45.120 --> 22:48.520
threw it away.

22:48.560 --> 22:52.040
No. Forensics showed traces of Richard's saliva

22:48.560 --> 22:52.040
in the cup.

22:52.080 --> 22:57.880
So he drank the tea after James left, leaving only

22:52.080 --> 22:57.880
Roger as a possible suspect.

22:57.920 --> 23:02.160
And yet, he's the only one of them who never went

22:57.920 --> 23:02.160
near Richard at any time.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.360
-Or so he says. -True.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.640
And then there's the damn book.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.080
Yes! Take the goose.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.480
-You take the goose because the fox won't eat the beans!

23:11.120 --> 23:14.480
-Yes.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.160
But then if he takes the fox out next,

23:14.520 --> 23:17.160
the goose will eat the beans.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.520
No, that's not right.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.680
If he takes the fox out next, it will eat the goose

23:20.720 --> 23:23.560
when he goes back for the beans. If he

23:20.720 --> 23:23.560
takes out the beans next,

23:23.600 --> 23:25.760
the goose will eat them when he goes back for the fox.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.840
The bottom line is none of them

23:30.120 --> 23:32.840
had a motive.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.400
It makes no sense.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.560
Ah.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.720
Oh, erm, it was a long flight.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.000
I could really use a change of clothes.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.560
Does anyone know where I'm staying?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.080
Ah!

24:00.120 --> 24:02.360
We treated it as a secondary crime scene,

24:02.400 --> 24:05.400
so everything of Richard has been taken away.

24:05.440 --> 24:09.840
You know, I really wouldn't mind booking into

24:05.440 --> 24:09.840
a B&amp;B or something.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.080
It must be quite tough, having someone else stay here.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.560
A little, yes,

24:14.600 --> 24:17.720
but if you stay on Saint-Marie, this

24:14.600 --> 24:17.720
will be your home, so...

24:17.760 --> 24:18.800
Yes.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.480
Will your wife be coming?

24:21.520 --> 24:22.800
Sally?

24:22.840 --> 24:24.760
In a week or so, I think.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.480
Er, yes. She's had to hang on.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.840
We're renting out our house in the UK,

24:26.520 --> 24:29.840
so she's dealing with that.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.880
Yes, at a bit of a loss without her, really.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.960
You must be.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.040
Er, there's an immersion heater for hot water.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.280
The switch is just beside it.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.640
Anything else, just ask.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.000
Quick shower and a change. Half an hour?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.360
I'll be outside.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.760
Oh.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.360
-Yes. Much better.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.240
There was a lizard in the bathroom.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.720
Harry. He comes with the house.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.680
Ah! Sitting tenant.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.640
He likes bugs smashed up with fruit.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.120
I'll do my best.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.480
This French novel Richard was supposedly reading,

25:40.080 --> 25:44.480
do you know it?

25:44.520 --> 25:48.000
Yes. <i> Le Rouge et le Noir.</i> We studied it at school.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.560
<i>Le Rouge et le Noir.</i>

25:49.600 --> 25:53.800
It's the story of, erm, of a carpenter's son,

25:49.600 --> 25:53.800
Julien Sorel.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.120
He rises up through French society in the 19th century.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.920
It's a satire.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.760
Can you think of any reason why that would be

25:58.960 --> 26:01.760
of interest to Richard?

26:01.800 --> 26:03.040
No.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.320
And even if it was, he couldn't read French,

26:05.360 --> 26:07.720
so the book would have been useless to him.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.120
Then why take it to a party?

26:09.160 --> 26:10.960
<i>-Bonjour.</i> -Oh, hello.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.200
<i>La poste pour monsieur Poole.</i>

26:12.240 --> 26:14.040
No, don't worry. I'll, I'll take it.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.920
It doesn't say who it's from.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.440
It's from the UK.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.600
Yeah. I wonder who sent it.

26:31.520 --> 26:35.440
Oh, sir? I've had a preliminary report

26:31.520 --> 26:35.440
back from the pathologist.

26:35.480 --> 26:39.560
-Oh, right. -Yes. It confirms what

26:35.480 --> 26:39.560
we already suspected.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.320
The ice pick entered the body through the third

26:39.600 --> 26:42.320
and fourth ribs.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.800
It punctured the right ventricle of the heart.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.360
Death would have been pretty instant.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.680
And the, er, background checks.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.680
You said you'd done them?

26:54.720 --> 27:00.720
That's right. We have. Now, Angela Birkett

26:54.720 --> 27:00.720
has her own law practice.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.440
She appears to be doing very well out of it.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.760
Roger Sadler is an estate agent based in Kent.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.800
He seems to be the least well-off.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.760
Now, Mr and Mrs Moore are worth a bomb.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.520
She sold her software company business in 2007

27:10.800 --> 27:15.520
for 18 million!

27:15.560 --> 27:17.360
The Moores moved to Spain seven years ago

27:17.400 --> 27:20.080
after Mrs Moore was involved in a road traffic accident.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.440
Really

27:21.480 --> 27:23.840
Sasha Moore was fine, but her sister, Helen Reed,

27:23.880 --> 27:26.120
was driving and she was killed.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.120
CAMILLE: This is interesting.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.440
HUMPHREY: What is?

27:35.480 --> 27:37.920
It looks like his university album.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.560
Look, there's Sasha.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.040
The gang.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.040
HUMPHREY: Richard and Sasha again.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.800
There's James.

27:49.840 --> 27:53.440
And there's Richard. Angela Birkett

27:49.840 --> 27:53.440
is behind him, look.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.560
Hmm.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.880
It's... I can't see Roger Sadler.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.480
Yes, it's their graduation photo.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.480
But why is it all here?

27:59.520 --> 28:01.440
Maybe he wanted to show his friends.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.560
Who sent it?

28:02.600 --> 28:05.640
Erm, his mother.

28:05.680 --> 28:10.400
"Dearest Richard, hope what you're looking for

28:05.680 --> 28:10.400
is here. Love, Mum."

28:10.440 --> 28:13.680
"Hope what you're looking for is here."

28:10.440 --> 28:13.680
What was he looking for?

28:13.720 --> 28:15.320
Looks like his diary.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.640
Ah, well, that could tell us something important.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.200
CAMILLE: I should read it.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.160
FIDEL: Sir, I've got something.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.600
There is a series of deleted e-mails to and from the UK

28:22.200 --> 28:26.600
from Angela Birkett.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.360
It looks like she's inviting him to their reunion, look.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.120
"Perhaps, if you don't want to come to the UK,

28:31.160 --> 28:33.320
"maybe I can persuade the others to come

28:31.160 --> 28:33.320
to Saint-Marie."

28:33.360 --> 28:37.000
So there was no coincidence. She knew he was

28:33.360 --> 28:37.000
here all along.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.280
She lied to us.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.280
ANGELA: Because I loved him.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.840
He was never interested in me,

28:45.880 --> 28:48.440
no matter how much of a fool I made of myself.

28:48.480 --> 28:52.760
With respect, doesn't explain why you lied to me.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.080
The others didn't know that Richard was here.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.280
It was bad enough at university.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.840
They were always teasing me, saying I was obsessed.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.560
They called me "Richard's little bunny boiler".

29:03.600 --> 29:07.040
If they knew I'd brought them all out here just because...

29:09.240 --> 29:12.920
Well, it wouldn't have been a proper reunion,

29:09.240 --> 29:12.920
not without Richard!

29:12.960 --> 29:17.040
Erm, could you excuse me, just for a moment?

29:17.080 --> 29:19.760
HUMPHREY: <i> You're saying</i> <i>you were never</i>

29:17.080 --> 29:19.760
<i>in a relationship with him?</i>

29:19.800 --> 29:22.320
ANGELA: <i> He only ever</i> <i>had eyes for Sasha.</i>

29:22.360 --> 29:23.920
Sasha Moore?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.880
He helped her with her dissertation.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.120
You know, they were...

29:28.160 --> 29:29.760
They were rarely apart.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.880
Must have been quite some reunion when she saw him.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.760
Actually...

29:34.920 --> 29:38.520
<i>I thought she was rather</i> <i>cool with him.</i>

29:38.560 --> 29:41.360
<i>I suppose it was probably</i> <i>for James' benefit.</i>

29:43.640 --> 29:47.360
James used to get a little bit jealous now and again,

29:47.400 --> 29:50.320
but I think that's why he kept sniping at him. You know,

29:47.400 --> 29:50.320
he was arguing with him.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.480
Oh?

29:51.520 --> 29:53.360
The day we bumped into Richard, we,

29:53.400 --> 29:55.160
we all went to this place for lunch.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.080
<i>I couldn't hear what</i> <i>they were saying.</i>

29:57.120 --> 29:59.600
<i>James said it was because</i> <i>Richard insisted</i>

29:57.120 --> 29:59.600
<i>on leaving a tip,</i>

29:59.640 --> 30:01.600
<i>even though</i> <i>the service was rubbish.</i>

30:01.640 --> 30:03.200
<i>But I...</i>

30:03.240 --> 30:06.720
<i>I just feel it was bound to be</i>

30:03.240 --> 30:06.720
<i>something about Sasha.</i>

30:13.560 --> 30:15.720
I'm sorry I lied.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.240
I didn't mean any harm.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.960
I really did love Richard.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.800
I couldn't have done anything to harm him. I really...

30:31.280 --> 30:32.680
I couldn't.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.200
You okay?

30:58.040 --> 30:59.800
It's so sad, you know,

30:59.840 --> 31:04.920
reading about someone's dreams,

30:59.840 --> 31:04.920
how they see their future,

31:04.960 --> 31:07.280
knowing that most of it will never happen.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.840
I miss him.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.800
I know.

31:20.480 --> 31:24.120
Ah! Dwayne said I'd find you here.

31:24.160 --> 31:29.560
Yes. This is my mother, Catherine. <i> Maman,</i>

31:24.160 --> 31:29.560
this is our new inspector.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.200
Humphrey. <i> Enchante.</i>

31:31.240 --> 31:32.760
Welcome to Saint-Marie.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.840
Thank you.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.560
And this is my mother's bar.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.760
-Oh!

31:38.600 --> 31:39.720
Tea?

31:39.760 --> 31:42.480
Tea? Heavens, no! It must be 100 degrees.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.360
Erm, I would like, please... Surprise me.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.320
Hmm.

31:49.360 --> 31:50.960
-Of course.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.120
Thank you.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.520
Is there, er, anything in Richard's diary

31:55.400 --> 31:58.520
that might help us?

31:58.560 --> 32:01.960
Well, it seems that Richard was in love with Sasha Reed.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.720
They were just friends, right? That's what

32:02.000 --> 32:04.720
Angela Birkett said.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.280
Yes, they were. But it's clear Richard wanted more than that.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.520
And she also has a boyfriend.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.960
James Moore.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.880
Who hates their friendship.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.840
But Sasha always sticks up for Richard.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.000
And makes James hate him even more, I'd imagine.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.960
Sasha's sister, Helen, was a year below them.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.800
When Richard left, she told him he wasn't

32:22.000 --> 32:25.800
being fair with Sasha.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.920
He realised it was true and he decided he'd

32:25.840 --> 32:28.920
never see her again.

32:28.960 --> 32:33.120
Ah, Catherine! Thank you. Er, what is it?

32:33.160 --> 32:35.800
A rum made on the island. The locals swear by it.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.440
Mmm, excellent! Erm...

32:37.480 --> 32:39.760
No, your first drink is on me. Enjoy.

32:39.800 --> 32:40.880
Thank you.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.440
Well, bottoms up!

32:46.480 --> 32:47.520
No, you should...

32:48.800 --> 32:49.800
Camille.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.200
Sir.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.320
Yes, Fidel?

32:55.560 --> 32:58.560
So I spoke to the staff at the Palm Court,

32:55.560 --> 32:58.560
and there was a waitress

32:58.600 --> 33:00.760
who said she saw the argument between James and Richard.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.400
Go on.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.680
Well, the way the waitress put it, erm,

33:06.720 --> 33:09.760
James was being very aggressive and she heard

33:06.720 --> 33:09.760
the name "Sasha".

33:16.680 --> 33:19.880
I think we need to speak to James Moore again, don't you?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.880
People really drink that?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.640
-Well, I do. -Right.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.840
HUMPHREY: Hello.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.640
Oh, for heaven's sake! How many times do we

33:43.880 --> 33:46.640
have to do all this?

33:46.680 --> 33:49.600
Only as long as it takes for you to tell us the truth.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.720
We have a witness who overheard the argument

33:49.640 --> 33:51.720
you had with Richard

33:51.760 --> 33:54.400
at the lunch and it wasn't about the tip, was it?

33:56.600 --> 33:58.240
Yeah, and while you're thinking about that,

33:58.280 --> 34:01.640
you can tell us about the relationship you had

33:58.280 --> 34:01.640
with him at university.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.160
Look, what is all this, eh?

34:04.200 --> 34:06.200
You resented the time he spent with Sasha.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.040
How the hell do you know that?

34:09.080 --> 34:11.240
Are you saying it isn't true?

34:11.280 --> 34:12.600
You know, he was like a fly.

34:12.640 --> 34:14.560
He was always buzzing around her.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.400
She wasn't remotely interested in him, of course,

34:16.440 --> 34:18.440
but the damn fool was infatuated with her.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.760
And it never went any further?

34:20.800 --> 34:23.560
Like I said, she wasn't interested in him.

34:23.600 --> 34:28.320
Then why, even after 20, 25 years,

34:23.600 --> 34:28.320
were you still jealous of him?

34:28.360 --> 34:31.760
That's what the argument was about, wasn't it? Sasha.

34:31.800 --> 34:35.680
I didn't take kindly to the way he was looking at my wife

34:31.800 --> 34:35.680
and I told him as much.

34:35.720 --> 34:38.320
-It's a start.

34:38.360 --> 34:42.800
All right. I admit it. I get twitchy when men look at

34:38.360 --> 34:42.800
Sasha. And when we all met up,

34:42.840 --> 34:44.840
I thought Richard was being over-familiar with her.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.800
It was like being back at university and I...

34:47.840 --> 34:48.840
I just snapped.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.040
You just leave Sasha alone!

34:56.720 --> 34:58.080
You seem to be an intelligent man, Inspector.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.720
Do you seriously believe that I would murder a policeman

35:03.760 --> 35:06.240
because of the way he was looking at my wife?

35:23.800 --> 35:25.960
-I don't trust him. -Nor do I.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.280
Doesn't mean he's our killer.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.000
Yes, then who is?

35:30.320 --> 35:32.800
-I saw you talking to James. -Yes.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.160
He's a good man.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.560
He just gets angry sometimes.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.720
And jealous?

35:42.600 --> 35:44.440
Okay. Richard and I...

35:48.000 --> 35:49.360
Richard was...

35:50.480 --> 35:53.080
Funny. You know, eccentric.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.240
He was one of my best friends.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.680
But I never felt the way he did.

36:03.160 --> 36:07.000
You know, it's funny. It's only now that he's gone

36:09.520 --> 36:12.520
that I realise how much I've been missing him.

36:15.720 --> 36:16.800
Anyway.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.920
I just wanted to tell you about James.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.680
Crisps.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.720
Cup of tea, cup of tea, tea.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.520
<i>Hi, you're through to Sally.</i> <i>I'm not here right now,</i>

36:51.560 --> 36:53.240
<i>but please leave a message</i> <i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

36:54.360 --> 36:57.880
Hello, my darling. Here safe.

36:57.920 --> 37:01.640
At least I've hit the ground running, so there's

36:57.920 --> 37:01.640
no time for jet lag yet.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.520
People are nice and, er, it is very beautiful.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.600
Love you.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Bye-bye.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.120
Okay, well, thank you very much for that.

37:15.880 --> 37:19.120
That was the dean's secretary at the university

37:15.880 --> 37:19.120
they all attended.

37:19.160 --> 37:23.360
It bugged me as to why Roger Sadler is not

37:19.160 --> 37:23.360
in the graduation photograph,

37:23.400 --> 37:25.280
-so she pulled his file for me.

37:25.320 --> 37:30.040
Simple. He never graduated. Roger was thrown

37:25.320 --> 37:30.040
out of university.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.360
What for?

37:31.400 --> 37:35.240
Cheating in his exams. And it gets better.

37:35.280 --> 37:38.320
He was reported to the dean by Richard Poole.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.360
You looking for me?

37:58.960 --> 38:00.960
Yes, we are.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.440
We understand that you were thrown out of university

38:01.000 --> 38:03.440
for cheating on your exams.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.240
It's a matter of public record.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.240
Why bring it up now?

38:10.280 --> 38:11.720
You didn't think to tell us?

38:12.720 --> 38:14.440
I hardly see how it's relevant.

38:14.480 --> 38:18.080
It's relevant because it was Richard who reported you,

38:14.480 --> 38:18.080
wasn't it?

38:19.040 --> 38:20.280
Is that true?

38:20.320 --> 38:21.920
You really expect us to believe you didn't know?

38:21.960 --> 38:24.400
Well, I didn't. Well, it was...

38:24.440 --> 38:27.320
It was 25 years ago. I honestly had no idea.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.080
Now, if you don't mind...

38:33.120 --> 38:34.560
You're lying!

38:36.400 --> 38:38.440
I beg your pardon?

38:38.480 --> 38:40.440
We've got Richard's diary.

38:40.480 --> 38:44.160
He's written about how you cheated,

38:40.480 --> 38:44.160
how he confronted you

38:44.200 --> 38:46.240
and you begged him not to tell, didn't you?

38:49.160 --> 38:51.240
I can arrest you and you can read it for yourself

38:51.280 --> 38:53.080
at the police station if you prefer.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.480
Yes, all right, all right.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.680
Richard wouldn't listen.

39:00.720 --> 39:04.200
I, I pleaded with him not to, but he went

39:00.720 --> 39:04.200
to the dean anyway.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.960
And in that very moment, my life was ruined.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.120
When I was booted out of Cambridge, I felt my life

39:07.000 --> 39:10.120
had come to an end

39:10.160 --> 39:13.880
and maybe I'd have happily killed him then.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.600
But that was a quarter of a century ago.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.040
I've moved on since then.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.280
Look, if you really think I'm the killer, then arrest me.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.360
But first you're gonna have to prove to me how I'm

39:20.320 --> 39:23.360
supposed to have done it.

39:23.400 --> 39:27.480
I've got three witnesses who say I never went near him

39:23.400 --> 39:27.480
in his bloody chair all night.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.800
-No.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.080
<i>Rouge et le Noir...</i>

39:48.120 --> 39:50.640
Doesn't speak French...

40:03.840 --> 40:05.560
It's getting late. You should get some sleep.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.640
We're so close. We have to be!

40:14.520 --> 40:16.640
And yet, why did he have to die?

40:23.120 --> 40:25.800
-Well, good night, sir. -Yes. Good night, Camille.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.120
<i>Hi, you're through to Sally.</i> <i>I'm not here right now,</i>

40:36.160 --> 40:38.200
<i>but please leave a message</i> <i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

40:43.320 --> 40:46.040
Okay, everyone. We are missing

40:43.320 --> 40:46.040
something.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.800
Means.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.640
All four of them had access to the murder weapon.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.320
HUMPHREY: Doesn't help. Opportunity.

40:52.360 --> 40:55.240
Erm, they all went out onto the veranda at one point

40:52.360 --> 40:55.240
or another.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.080
Doesn't help either,

40:57.120 --> 40:59.280
but at least neither means nor opportunity rules

40:57.120 --> 40:59.280
any of them out.

40:59.320 --> 41:02.240
Which brings us back to the one thing we keep

40:59.320 --> 41:02.240
coming back to. Motive.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.920
Yes, but do we really believe someone waited

41:02.280 --> 41:04.920
all that time to kill him?

41:04.960 --> 41:06.800
-We don't believe there was an intruder either.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.800
-No.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.760
Then something must have happened

41:08.800 --> 41:11.600
after they arrived in Saint-Marie, something

41:08.800 --> 41:11.600
that provided a motive.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.320
You know what really confuses me?

41:13.360 --> 41:16.400
Why kill him at the villa

41:16.440 --> 41:21.000
The man lives in a shack on a beach, miles from anyone.

41:16.440 --> 41:21.000
Why not kill him there?

41:21.040 --> 41:23.120
You're right! He was murdered at a party.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.400
It's as though the killer felt they had no choice,

41:25.440 --> 41:27.400
that Richard Poole had to die that evening. Why?

41:27.440 --> 41:29.280
Perhaps he was about to expose one of them.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.280
Yes! That's it, that's it! A ticking clock.

41:34.920 --> 41:39.240
He knew something, didn't he? Or, at the very least,

41:34.920 --> 41:39.240
suspected it.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.040
That's why he sent home for these things.

41:42.080 --> 41:46.840
He believed that something in here would confirm

41:42.080 --> 41:46.840
what he discovered.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.400
But what?

41:50.280 --> 41:51.520
Come on!

41:56.440 --> 41:58.760
Right. There's a flight into Paris leaving at 3:00

41:58.800 --> 42:01.560
and a connecting flight into London. They've got

41:58.800 --> 42:01.560
seats if we want them.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.840
What about the police?

42:02.880 --> 42:04.320
Well, we've answered all their bloody questions.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.160
They can't stop us from going home.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.160
Come on.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.640
Ange? Come on.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.600
DWAYNE: That's very interesting.

42:24.080 --> 42:26.840
I've just spoken to a clerk at Angela Birkett's

42:24.080 --> 42:26.840
law practice.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.240
Took a little bit of the old Dwayne love dust,

42:29.280 --> 42:32.280
but she told me that Angela hasn't been in

42:29.280 --> 42:32.280
any kind of relationship

42:32.320 --> 42:33.960
since she started there eight years ago.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.440
What is the "Dwayne love dust"?

42:35.480 --> 42:36.760
Don't ask!

42:36.800 --> 42:38.120
The police report from the traffic accident

42:38.160 --> 42:40.120
that Sasha Moore was involved in, sir.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.360
Seems like a lorry had a puncture,

42:40.160 --> 42:42.360
swerved into two lanes.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.200
Her sister was driving, but there was nothing

42:42.400 --> 42:44.200
she could do.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.800
Helen was killed instantly.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.680
Okay. Thanks, Fidel.

42:47.720 --> 42:50.600
And only Roger Sadler and Angela Birkett

42:47.720 --> 42:50.600
had social network sites.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.200
-Bit about the reunion, but...

42:50.640 --> 42:52.200
-Okay!

42:53.640 --> 42:55.400
Enough of the information overload.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.680
Let's keep it simple. The mementos.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.480
Why did he need the stuff he sent for?

43:03.560 --> 43:05.800
And the book. Come on!

43:05.840 --> 43:07.240
Why take a book to a party?

43:07.280 --> 43:08.760
What was he up to?

43:08.800 --> 43:10.320
It's like he's testing us.

43:10.360 --> 43:14.120
Yes, well, you know, that would be

43:10.360 --> 43:14.120
the chief all over, sir.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.160
And the book was on the floor, which is a bit of a puzzle.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.720
<i>-It was in French.</i> -Testing!

43:18.760 --> 43:21.240
CAMILLE: It looks like things from his time at university.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.280
ROGER: <i> Haven't seen</i> <i>the man for 25 years!</i>

43:23.320 --> 43:26.160
He helped her with her dissertation.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.920
But no, of course. Of course! Testing us.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.600
Honore Police Station.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.680
DWAYNE: That was the hotel, the reunion party's

43:52.760 --> 43:55.680
checking out.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.520
What? We need to stop them!

43:57.560 --> 43:59.160
Yes! Stop them.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.200
Fidel.

44:02.360 --> 44:03.480
Look at this.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.600
What am I looking at?

44:06.640 --> 44:09.720
Name at the top. Got the who, just

44:06.640 --> 44:09.720
need the how.

44:14.240 --> 44:16.520
-There's no Jeep. -Camille took it.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.080
What do we do, then?

44:19.760 --> 44:21.160
Oh, no.

44:37.560 --> 44:38.600
Splendid!

44:44.680 --> 44:45.680
Lovely.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.240
Splendid.

44:55.600 --> 44:56.800
Got it.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.400
What are they all doing here?

45:15.440 --> 45:18.120
This is the part where you expose the killer.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.400
In front of everyone?

45:20.440 --> 45:23.120
It's how Richard did it.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.720
-Yes.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.360
Look, can someone tell us what the bloody hell is going on

45:28.400 --> 45:30.040
because we all have a plane to catch.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.240
We've answered all your questions.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.880
Er, no, you've answered some of them.

45:33.920 --> 45:35.200
Some I haven't asked yet.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.040
Sorry.

45:40.080 --> 45:45.360
You know, bizarrely, I'm the only one who never

45:40.080 --> 45:45.360
met Richard Poole.

45:45.400 --> 45:50.040
But during this case, I feel as though I've got to know him

45:45.400 --> 45:50.040
a little.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.560
Mostly by the effect he had on those around him.

45:54.040 --> 45:57.120
But it seems we all forgot one very crucial thing.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.640
He was a detective.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.720
A good one.

46:02.760 --> 46:06.120
Now, I think he made a discovery, had a theory

46:02.760 --> 46:06.120
about what he discovered,

46:06.160 --> 46:09.400
and then sent home for evidence to

46:06.160 --> 46:09.400
corroborate that theory.

46:09.440 --> 46:14.200
And in doing so, he has, in essence,

46:09.440 --> 46:14.200
solved his own murder.

46:14.240 --> 46:18.240
You know, the biggest problem we had was

46:14.240 --> 46:18.240
establishing a motive.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.560
Why kill someone you haven't seen for 25 years?

46:21.600 --> 46:26.160
It simply can't be any of us, we were in sight of each other

46:21.600 --> 46:26.160
the whole time!

46:26.200 --> 46:29.080
Apart from Roger when he went out

46:26.200 --> 46:29.080
to light the barbecue.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.520
Now, now hold on a second, I didn't bloody kill anyone,

46:32.560 --> 46:35.400
-I didn't go anywhere near him.

46:32.560 --> 46:35.400
-No, you didn't.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.520
-I said you

46:35.440 --> 46:38.520
didn't kill Richard Poole.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.960
Oh. Right, good.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.880
Thank you.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.120
I can't bear this! I've told you all I know,

46:49.160 --> 46:51.680
I wouldn't have hurt Richard, you all know that!

46:51.720 --> 46:53.640
I loved him.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.440
And I believe you.

46:58.880 --> 47:00.120
And then there were two.

47:02.480 --> 47:06.440
You see, it was a little like the goose, the fox

47:02.480 --> 47:06.440
and the beans,

47:07.720 --> 47:10.960
working out who did what, when,

47:11.000 --> 47:12.720
and in what order.

47:12.760 --> 47:15.400
First, Angela checked he was all right.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.320
Why don't you come in, Richard? It'll be fun.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.440
CAMILLE: <i> She asked him if he</i> <i>wanted another cup of tea.</i>

47:19.480 --> 47:21.920
<i>But when she left him,</i> <i>we believe he was still alive.</i>

47:21.960 --> 47:25.880
HUMPHREY: Then a little later, you took him

47:21.960 --> 47:25.880
out his bowl of crisps.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.680
Remind me.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.880
Who was it who suggested playing charades that night?

47:30.920 --> 47:33.160
It was you, wasn't it, Sash?

47:33.200 --> 47:34.840
It might have been. Why?

47:34.880 --> 47:38.280
Why? Because it was well known Richard hated playing games,

47:38.320 --> 47:41.360
so how better for his killer to isolate him from the group?

47:41.400 --> 47:44.400
Yes, you needed him to be on his own away from

47:41.400 --> 47:44.400
the others, didn't you?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.760
So that you could murder him.

47:48.760 --> 47:49.840
No.

47:50.960 --> 47:53.160
-No! -That can't be right.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.840
Richard was still alive when Sasha came back inside.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.440
He drank the tea, he ate the food.

47:58.480 --> 48:01.000
Not quite, because Sasha

47:58.480 --> 48:01.000
had an accomplice.

48:03.800 --> 48:04.800
James. What?

48:08.280 --> 48:10.520
Angela.

48:10.560 --> 48:13.320
When Richard asked you for another cup of tea,

48:13.360 --> 48:16.840
did you take the old cup back into the house?

48:19.960 --> 48:23.160
<i>When you took him</i> <i>out his crisps.</i>

48:23.200 --> 48:26.760
<i>And you didn't take him out</i> <i>a new cup of tea, did you?</i>

48:26.800 --> 48:28.040
<i>You took him out the old one.</i>

48:28.080 --> 48:30.400
I'll just take His Lordship this.

48:30.440 --> 48:34.680
HUMPHREY: <i> All done</i> <i>to establish an alibi</i>

48:30.440 --> 48:34.680
<i>for your wife.</i>

48:34.720 --> 48:37.280
You see the "how" was reasonably easy,

48:37.320 --> 48:39.720
once we knew that one of you committed the murder,

48:39.760 --> 48:44.160
but it was the "why", the "why" that was

48:39.760 --> 48:44.160
the most elusive.

48:44.200 --> 48:49.200
Why would anyone kill an old friend they

48:44.200 --> 48:49.200
hadn't seen for 25 years?

48:49.240 --> 48:52.480
In fact, by this logic, Sasha was our

48:49.240 --> 48:52.480
least likely suspect.

48:52.520 --> 48:54.920
After all, she and Richard were best mates in college.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.760
But that's how...

48:56.800 --> 49:01.440
That's how I knew it had to be you who wielded the ice pick.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.600
Richard Poole wasn't killed by an old friend as

49:01.480 --> 49:04.600
we've been thinking all along.

49:06.280 --> 49:08.360
He was killed by a relative stranger.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.440
What are you talking about?

49:12.480 --> 49:15.480
Because you're not Sasha Moore.

49:15.520 --> 49:19.360
You're Helen Reed, her sister.

49:19.400 --> 49:23.320
Only one year separated two sisters,

49:19.400 --> 49:23.320
Sasha and Helen Reed.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.440
Both attended the same university.

49:25.480 --> 49:28.360
In the police file from the road traffic accident

49:25.480 --> 49:28.360
you were both involved in,

49:28.400 --> 49:31.480
there's a police report showing an earlier

49:28.400 --> 49:31.480
conviction for shoplifting.

49:31.520 --> 49:34.840
Which was around the time Sasha founded her

49:31.520 --> 49:34.840
computer software company.

49:34.880 --> 49:37.560
Unlike her, you were unemployed,

49:34.880 --> 49:37.560
you had no money.

49:37.600 --> 49:40.000
And even years later, after your much more

49:37.600 --> 49:40.000
successful sister

49:40.040 --> 49:44.080
sold her company for a small fortune,

49:40.040 --> 49:44.080
you were still struggling.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.880
What happened after that car accident?

49:48.920 --> 49:51.800
Two sisters, both injured, one fatally.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.520
Was there some confusion about who was who?

49:55.560 --> 49:58.120
Did someone ask you if you were Sasha?

49:58.160 --> 50:00.960
Was the opportunity just too good to miss?

50:06.920 --> 50:10.480
Had the affair with her sister already started?

50:10.520 --> 50:13.960
Or did it begin once she got control of

50:10.520 --> 50:13.960
your dead wife's fortune?

50:17.040 --> 50:19.520
This is the real Sasha.

50:19.560 --> 50:24.000
Full of life and joy, about to marry her

50:19.560 --> 50:24.000
college sweetheart James.

50:26.040 --> 50:29.400
And this is you. You already looked

50:26.040 --> 50:29.400
a bit like your sister,

50:29.440 --> 50:32.080
but helped on with a touch of cosmetic surgery.

50:32.120 --> 50:35.160
Didn't you say you had your cosmetic surgery here?

50:35.200 --> 50:37.240
No, that was Saint Lucia, darling.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.680
None of you had seen each other for years,

50:39.720 --> 50:42.880
so when Angie called up and asked you

50:39.720 --> 50:42.880
to attend the reunion,

50:42.920 --> 50:44.880
you thought you'd be able to get away with it.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.080
Until you bumped into Richard.

50:46.120 --> 50:47.720
What are you all doing here?

50:47.760 --> 50:49.800
HUMPHREY: <i> Yes. Richard.</i> <i>Not only a detective,</i>

50:49.840 --> 50:52.480
<i>but someone who knew the real</i> <i>Sasha better than all of you.</i>

50:53.760 --> 50:55.480
I think he was on to you from the start.

50:55.520 --> 50:58.080
It's no wonder you were cold with him,

50:58.120 --> 51:00.240
you hardly knew him at all.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.200
And when you lost your temper with him,

51:02.240 --> 51:04.040
you were not being jealous,

51:04.080 --> 51:06.600
you were simply trying to prevent him

51:04.080 --> 51:06.600
from speaking to Sasha.

51:06.640 --> 51:10.120
HUMPHREY: In the end, there are two pieces

51:06.640 --> 51:10.120
of damning evidence.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.440
This is the book Richard brought with him that night.

51:12.480 --> 51:14.000
-You said you hadn't read it. -I haven't read it.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.640
Which is rather the point.

51:19.080 --> 51:23.040
This is a photograph taken from the box

51:19.080 --> 51:23.040
Richard sent home for.

51:23.080 --> 51:26.800
I believe it's a photograph celebrating

51:23.080 --> 51:26.800
Sasha's dissertation.

51:26.840 --> 51:31.320
It's very hard to see with the naked eye,

51:26.840 --> 51:31.320
but if you look closely,

51:31.360 --> 51:35.440
you can see a copy of the finished dissertation

51:31.360 --> 51:35.440
in front of Sasha.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.840
<i>Le Rouge et le Noir.</i>

51:41.560 --> 51:44.480
Which is why Richard was holding a book

51:41.560 --> 51:44.480
we know he couldn't read.

51:44.520 --> 51:47.480
He brought it with him that night as a final test

51:47.520 --> 51:50.200
to confirm his suspicion that you were not

51:47.520 --> 51:50.200
the Sasha he knew.

51:51.560 --> 51:53.480
Found it in the market.

51:54.720 --> 51:55.720
Do you know it?

51:56.400 --> 51:58.200
No, I don't know it.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.880
HUMPHREY: <i> When you realised</i> <i>Richard Poole was on to you...</i>

52:05.920 --> 52:07.320
He knows.

52:07.360 --> 52:09.480
<i>...you decided to kill him.</i>

52:10.240 --> 52:11.600
<i>Trust me, he knows.</i>

52:12.640 --> 52:14.040
<i>I'll do it.</i>

52:15.400 --> 52:18.000
All of which,

52:18.040 --> 52:21.000
I suppose, may be regarded as circumstantial,

52:22.800 --> 52:23.920
until we see this.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.960
Helen Reed's shoplifting conviction.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.400
The prints on this

52:31.440 --> 52:33.920
match the exclusion prints you gave us after the murder,

52:33.960 --> 52:36.840
leading me to make only one conclusion,

52:36.880 --> 52:40.440
which is why Richard had to die and he had

52:36.880 --> 52:40.440
to die that evening.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.200
<i>You had to</i> <i>protect your secret.</i>

52:53.680 --> 52:54.920
Richard?

52:58.880 --> 53:00.560
Sorry about that.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.920
-ANGELA: Brilliant!

53:36.640 --> 53:38.280
<i>Madame.</i>

53:40.800 --> 53:41.840
Nice one.

53:43.120 --> 53:44.600
Thanks.

54:04.040 --> 54:07.880
He'd still be alive, wouldn't he,

54:04.040 --> 54:07.880
if I hadn't brought her here?

54:24.960 --> 54:27.800
-Well done, sir. -Well done to all of

54:24.960 --> 54:27.800
us, Fidel.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.040
I'm sure the inspector would've been proud of you.

54:30.080 --> 54:32.440
Yes, I'm sure he would have.

54:32.480 --> 54:34.960
-There is just one thing still bothering me.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.520
-The fox, the goose and the bag of beans.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.520
-Ah! Well, you see,

54:37.560 --> 54:40.600
you take the goose over first and then go back

54:37.560 --> 54:40.600
for the beans...

54:40.640 --> 54:43.720
Yes, but then won't the goose eat the beans when you go back

54:40.640 --> 54:43.720
for the fox?

54:43.760 --> 54:45.520
No.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.080
And here's the clever bit.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.560
When you go back for the fox, you take the beans with you.

54:49.600 --> 54:51.520
I'm sorry, you take the goose with you. I think...

54:56.280 --> 54:59.600
Well, I'd better start writing up my report.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.680
Ah, erm...

55:01.720 --> 55:04.560
Where are all my bits of paper and stuff?

55:05.520 --> 55:06.680
Erm...

55:08.120 --> 55:10.320
I put them on your desk, sir.

55:11.680 --> 55:12.720
Oh.

55:16.720 --> 55:19.880
-Good night. -Yes, er, yes,

55:16.720 --> 55:19.880
good night, Camille.

55:55.040 --> 55:57.400
Only the chief could have solved his own murder.

55:57.440 --> 56:01.480
Just so you know, his body has been released,

55:57.440 --> 56:01.480
they'll fly him home tomorrow.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.840
He was a good man.

56:05.880 --> 56:10.400
Well, if he's going home, I say we have a remembrance

56:05.880 --> 56:10.400
service right here tonight.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.320
I'm going to remember him till I fall over.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.040
Taxi!

56:21.840 --> 56:23.040
DWAYNE: To the chief!

56:31.200 --> 56:33.480
Where are you going? It's the commissioner's round!

56:33.520 --> 56:34.720
I'll be back.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.160
Sir!

56:38.440 --> 56:42.360
We were having a drink. Come and join us.

56:42.400 --> 56:45.360
That's really sweet of you, but, er, I shouldn't.

56:45.400 --> 56:46.840
Why not?

56:46.880 --> 56:51.080
Well, you all need to spend a bit of time

56:51.120 --> 56:52.920
to say goodbye to Richard in your own way.

56:54.760 --> 56:57.200
It'd be a bit awkward if I was there.

56:57.240 --> 56:59.240
I need to unpack.

57:00.760 --> 57:02.080
If I can find a taxi.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.200
Okay.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.240
I'll see you tomorrow.

57:09.240 --> 57:10.240
Bye, Camille.

57:36.760 --> 57:38.920
SALLY: <i> Hello, Humph, it's me.</i>

57:38.960 --> 57:42.160
<i>God, I usually hate these</i> <i>things, but now I'm rather</i>

57:38.960 --> 57:42.160
<i>pleased you're not there.</i>

57:42.200 --> 57:44.200
<i>Look, the thing is,</i> <i>Humph, I...</i>

57:44.240 --> 57:45.240
<i>Well...</i>

57:46.240 --> 57:47.800
<i>I'm not coming.</i>

57:47.840 --> 57:49.960
<i>I never was.</i> <i>And I know I should have had</i>

57:50.000 --> 57:52.120
<i>this conversation</i> <i>before you left,</i>

57:52.160 --> 57:55.400
<i>but I'm a terrible coward</i> <i>and this just seemed...</i>

57:57.000 --> 57:58.280
<i>Look, the thing is,</i>

57:58.320 --> 58:02.240
<i>I don't love you any more,</i> <i>not really.</i>

58:02.280 --> 58:04.960
<i>So there, I've said it.</i>

58:05.000 --> 58:06.840
<i>And I'm so sorry, I truly am!</i>

58:06.880 --> 58:08.280
<i>And this, this may well</i> <i>turn out to be</i>

58:08.320 --> 58:12.480
<i>the biggest mistake of</i> <i>my life, but it's how I feel.</i>

58:12.520 --> 58:14.480
<i>You'll be okay,</i> <i>won't you, Humph?</i>

58:15.200 --> 58:16.200
Action!

58:18.120 --> 58:21.200
The day she's satisfied is the day she dies.

58:23.080 --> 58:25.120
Right. Thea! Call an ambulance!

58:25.160 --> 58:29.000
A stand-in is killed after only a few weeks

58:25.160 --> 58:29.000
on a film set.

58:29.040 --> 58:31.520
It's my fault she was out here.

58:31.560 --> 58:33.520
This is not the not the act of a writer.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.000
-Your wife, she arrives tomorrow.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.000
-Yes, of course.
