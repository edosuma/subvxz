WEBVTT

01:03.731 --> 01:06.315
What are you doing? l'll make breakfast.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.196
Don, you're gonna be late.

01:15.534 --> 01:16.534
Damn it.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.375
-Bonjour, Marie.
-Would you like an omelet?

01:25.169 --> 01:26.252
l'd better not.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.962
You can't eat an egg?

01:28.464 --> 01:29.505
Do l have to call the dentist?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.924
lt'll go away. lt always does.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.969
Go easy on the mouthwash.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.346
Have fun.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.810
Why bother him?

01:43.145 --> 01:44.520
With what?

01:48.358 --> 01:50.735
"We're sorry that there's been
no response to your reel.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.615
"We would encourage you to try our
advanced film workshop for a low..."

01:55.991 --> 01:57.241
What is it?

01:58.494 --> 02:00.661
l paid for a screen test.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.498
They were supposed to send it to agents.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.292
And they weren't interested?

02:06.376 --> 02:09.420
How could they have
sent it to anybody but me in a week?

02:09.505 --> 02:11.172
They're selling classes.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.675
lt's a great thing
to take advantage of hopeless people.

02:15.886 --> 02:16.886
Hopeless?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.607
Beth, l don't know
if you remember Pete Campbell.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.610
Of course. We almost had dinner.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.825
How was the second honeymoon?
Did you create another beneficiary?

02:40.244 --> 02:41.577
So where are you off to?

02:43.372 --> 02:45.206
She's gonna stay
with her sister for a little bit.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.791
And where is that?

02:47.543 --> 02:50.586
You know what, honey?
l'm going to the smoker.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.798
-We'll have to stand.
-You don't have to come.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.010
Don't take it personally.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.972
She's in a mood.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.977
Excuse me. Can l just get by here, please?

03:06.645 --> 03:08.062
-Go right ahead.
-Thank you.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.824
Morning.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.036
-38? Where are you going?
-l made a mistake.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.789
Okay.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.835
Because l heard that
the parachute company upstairs

03:30.919 --> 03:32.962
got a big government contract
and moved to Washington

03:33.046 --> 03:34.797
to be closer to the cemetery or something.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.592
For once, mind your own business, Harry.

03:38.635 --> 03:42.889
All l'm saying is if we're getting more space,
l'll take anything without a column in it.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.766
We offered you another office
and you turned it down.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.352
You didn't want his office either.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.229
So is it true or not?

03:55.027 --> 03:57.403
l need a window, Joan. l'm getting scurvy.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.785
Adam?

04:12.294 --> 04:16.130
Topaz. Always less expensive. Never cheap.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.969
-l hate it.
-No, you don't.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.638
So we're aiming for cheap girls?

04:23.972 --> 04:26.098
-Girl's not cheap.
-So we're cheap.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.309
Art, come on.
We agreed on a value approach.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.645
-l hate the word "cheap."
-And so do l!

04:30.729 --> 04:32.813
That's why l put the word
"never" in front of it.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.649
You say the word, you put it on their mind.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.070
l hate to quote you directly,

04:39.154 --> 04:42.323
but didn't you say that with Topaz,
a girl could be sexy for pocket change?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.533
l thought it was gonna be
"Two for one, twice the fun."

04:44.618 --> 04:46.118
That really sounds cheap.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.828
Perhaps Don can answer this.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.247
Gentlemen, how are you?

04:51.375 --> 04:53.334
Art and Marvin object to the word "cheap."

04:55.504 --> 04:57.672
You're aware the word
does not refer to Topaz.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.384
Clearly it states the exact opposite.
And it's very funny.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.636
We're supposed to be part of a fantasy,

05:03.720 --> 05:06.013
and l don't think cheap
is part of any girl's fantasy.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.890
Why don't you get a girl's opinion?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.809
l used to take that as a given here.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.186
And l'm not talking about
black coffee out there.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.691
-We're happy to copy test it for you.
-What's that gonna cost?

05:16.775 --> 05:18.818
They're not charging us.
They should've done it already.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.778
-Let me walk you out.
-See you soon.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.952
Why the hell didn't you get any research?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.829
Because we never had
to do it for them before.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.623
The client didn't like it and we did.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.291
ln the end, isn't that
how we know it's good?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.585
-Then this is a success.
-l consider it a success.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.255
You didn't have to go a single day
without telling me l'm an idiot.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.551
l'll tell you what,
l'm so bored of this dynamic.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.639
l have your sister-in-law.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.727
-Hello, Judy.
-No, it's me.

05:54.563 --> 05:55.604
Beth.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.190
-l know who it is.
-l have to see you.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.817
Jesus, l'm at work.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.072
Clara, could you go to the lobby
and get me a pack of Life Savers?

06:05.532 --> 06:06.907
What's wrong with the machine?

06:07.617 --> 06:09.285
l want them fresh.

06:09.619 --> 06:13.247
So you ran into me on the train
and suddenly remember who l was?

06:13.749 --> 06:17.668
Meet me where you wanted to meet before,
the Hotel Pennsylvania.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.546
l'll be there at noon
under the name Mrs. Campbell.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.424
l hope you like waiting. That's what l did.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.093
This may be our last chance.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.018
Why is this so hard?

06:34.936 --> 06:38.647
lt has to be 1 25 words
and 1 5 of them have to be "Ajax."

06:38.940 --> 06:41.776
Fellas, can l have Miss Olson
to myself for a minute?

06:45.447 --> 06:46.781
Do you smoke?

06:46.865 --> 06:47.907
Not really.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.116
Well, get started.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.744
Smoke it, name it, sell it.

06:51.995 --> 06:52.995
What is it?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.790
Philip Morris' top secret ladies' cigarette.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.042
Leo Burnett thinks it's too small,
and now it's in review.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.211
So it's yourjob to make sure they're sorry.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.171
-Great.
-Evan!

07:03.423 --> 07:06.550
Flip through the research at your leisure
and then get your little ones on it.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.928
Did they tell you anything l should know?

07:10.222 --> 07:11.680
Does your boyfriend light your cigarettes?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.641
-l don't smoke.
-Yes, you do.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.894
lt's gotta make noise.
Maybe she lights it herself.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.481
So is that what it is,
or is it something like that?

07:21.024 --> 07:23.984
You're a woman and you smoke.
What do you want?

07:27.489 --> 07:31.075
All of last year's third
and fourth quarters' work has posted

07:31.159 --> 07:34.912
with sizeable checks from Vicks,
Sugarberry and Heinz in the bank.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.082
And with Mohawk returning
to its prestrike billings,

07:38.166 --> 07:42.211
revenues are up 34% from last year,
making this our best quarter.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.672
lt's March. lt's our only quarter.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.133
Not this year. Ever.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.176
And with Jaguar due to run

07:49.261 --> 07:51.887
and Butler shooting
and running within the month,

07:52.013 --> 07:55.182
projections for next quarter
are equally bright.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.059
Have you found me an office?

07:57.352 --> 08:00.354
Unfortunately, l was unable
to go upstairs this morning.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.605
Harry Crane.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.941
But l am meeting
with the building manager at lunch.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.860
Get more than we need.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.570
Any objections?

08:16.121 --> 08:19.623
l'm sorry, but l feel
someone has to voice the negatives.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.794
Perhaps after one quarter, we should be
careful not to overextend ourselves.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.045
Can we just vote?

08:25.297 --> 08:27.798
Or we could table
this discussion until June.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.134
-All in favor of tabling the vote?
-Aye.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.470
Tabling does not require a vote.
lt only needs to be seconded.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.182
-What is this, parliament?
-ls this meeting over yet?

08:36.266 --> 08:37.349
No, it's not.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.935
Don, l give you my proxy.
l have things to do.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.109
We can do that?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.291
Thank God.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.834
Stop it.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.713
-l knew you'd show.
-Because l'm pathetic?

09:09.758 --> 09:12.301
lf you're so angry, why did you come?

09:13.303 --> 09:14.929
You know l had to.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.351
Come sit with me.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.277
l'm not going to my sister's.

09:31.780 --> 09:35.950
l... Well, Howard checked me
into the hospital this morning.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.285
For what? What's wrong?

09:39.120 --> 09:43.916
lt's hard to explain, but l've been very blue

09:45.001 --> 09:49.463
and the doctors seem to think
the only thing to do is electroshock.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.716
Shock treatment? You're not crazy.

09:53.802 --> 09:58.931
Look, Peter, l wanted to see you
because it's going to be different after.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.891
lt always is.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.936
You've done it before?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.646
Yes.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.984
And it creates this sort of gray cloud.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.444
The last time, l lost months and...

10:12.946 --> 10:15.864
This is wonderful. You're wonderful.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.953
l don't want to forget and l'm afraid l will.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.918
l told them l was going
to my niece's birthday party.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.587
l have to be back by 5:00
so l'll be ready for tomorrow.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.174
What makes you think l would do this?
You are crazy.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.012
Please.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.849
Please give me this.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.031
Oh, God.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.454
Why does everybody want redheads?

11:03.538 --> 11:07.041
Anybody can become a redhead.
l mean, even Julia's working.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.834
Working?

11:08.918 --> 11:12.546
She did three days on Dark Shadows
and then they fired her and cut her out.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.341
Shit. l keep telling her how good she was.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.306
This is why you're not working.
You won't answer the phone.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.020
Hello?

11:28.396 --> 11:29.855
l can hear you.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.568
Heavy breathing?

11:34.652 --> 11:36.570
l thought it was a wrong number,
but they keep calling

11:36.654 --> 11:38.405
and they never say they're sorry.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.700
l wish you would have told me
we had company.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.327
l wouldn't have come out like this.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.120
Hello. Nice to meet you.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.790
-Mother, this is Emily from class.
-Pleasure.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.501
Megan, did you get me an appointment
for a wash and set?

11:50.585 --> 11:51.794
Yes, Mama.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.546
-How long are you in town for?
-Only a week.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.759
l wanted to spend Easter with my daughter.
My husband is an atheist.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.552
What are your plans for today?

12:01.054 --> 12:04.431
-We are looking at the casting notices.
-Bonne chance.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.478
She's so elegant and encouraging.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.271
l guess so.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.775
Listen.

12:17.695 --> 12:22.533
l hope you know that if l could ever help you
in any way, l would want you to ask.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.451
Okay.

12:25.036 --> 12:29.790
My agent put me up for this part.
lt's really cute.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.251
lt's based on Beauty and the Beast

12:33.294 --> 12:35.796
and, well, it's a commercial
for Barnett shoes.

12:36.631 --> 12:37.673
And?

12:37.757 --> 12:41.135
Don's the Draper
in Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, isn't he?

12:41.636 --> 12:44.430
-Do you mean Butler shoes?
-Yes, that's it.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.850
Look, l really don't want
to make you uncomfortable.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.811
l am completely prepared for no. l just...

12:51.938 --> 12:53.355
lt' a European type.

12:54.315 --> 12:59.486
l'm sorry, but Don doesn't do that.
That's not the way it works.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.321
lt's really up to the client.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.532
All l want is an audition.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.326
l'd ask you who l have to sleep with,
but l don't think you'd like it.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.999
Okay. l'll see what l can do.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.211
l am your eternal slave.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.089
But if it doesn't work out,

13:19.174 --> 13:21.008
you're gonna have to act
like you never asked.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.384
Now find me a job.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.353
l should go.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.899
Howard's coming by after work.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.234
lt was terrible.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.196
l couldn't find the party,
then l couldn't get a cab.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.448
For four hours?

13:54.584 --> 13:59.046
Don't tell me you're not happy right now.
Don't tell me you don't feel better.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.810
Howard can't make you do this.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.024
He wants to control you. He's a monster.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.653
You just hate him
because he voted for Goldwater.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.905
This is not a joke.

14:25.448 --> 14:29.701
Let's go to Los Angeles. l've been there.
lt's filled with sunshine.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.745
l can't.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.040
Why?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.087
lt's so dark, Peter,

14:41.172 --> 14:42.548
that l just

14:43.174 --> 14:48.136
get to this place
and l suddenly feel this door open

14:49.055 --> 14:51.265
and l wanna walk through it.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.518
That's for weak people,

14:55.436 --> 14:57.563
people who can't solve a problem.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.483
You want to solve a problem? Zip me up.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.289
And then you'll leave.

15:16.708 --> 15:20.085
-And what if you forget you love me?
-Peter.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.964
l don't know you and you don't know me.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.176
We just happen to have the same problem.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.096
l know, but we're only sad
because we're apart.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.851
Then l was wrong.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.313
l really should go.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.647
Why?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.067
Because it works.

15:44.736 --> 15:45.944
Really?

15:54.370 --> 15:56.038
Five more minutes.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.632
-Hello.
-How are you feeling?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.508
-Better.
-Good.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.093
Just in case, l made soup.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.429
l'll change for dinner.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.891
We'll be right out.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.066
Are you really feeling better?
l didn't get a kiss.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.984
l swear l'm better.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.871
Emily was telling me that Butler shoes
is shooting a new commercial.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.998
"Beauty and the Beast."

16:43.086 --> 16:45.712
Well, she said they're looking
for a European girl.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.547
And l was thinking,

16:47.924 --> 16:52.010
well, l'd be mad at myself if l didn't ask,

16:53.221 --> 16:54.805
and, well, l wouldn't ask

16:54.889 --> 16:58.183
if l didn't think l'd be right for it,
but l really am.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.936
What?

17:06.984 --> 17:09.695
All l want you to do is put my name in a pile.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.822
l know they're gonna wanna see
what l look like on film

17:11.906 --> 17:13.865
and l happen to have it.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.536
You wanna be in a commercial?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.413
l wanna work.

17:19.831 --> 17:22.165
lt's in town, so l'd be home for dinner.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.585
-l thought you hated advertising.
-l never said that.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.715
Well, you certainly don't think it's art.
And you're an artist, aren't you?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.467
Are you mad at me?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.136
l'm just surprised.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.972
lt's not theater, it's not Broadway,
it's not film.

17:37.432 --> 17:41.351
A national commercial?
All my friends would kill for it.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.438
-You'd get in the union, you'd get exposure.
-You'd get money.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.273
That's why they want it. You don't need that.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.944
Do you know how hard this was
for me to even ask you?

17:51.571 --> 17:55.073
Do you know how hard it would be to ask
Charles Butler Jr. to hire my wife?

17:55.616 --> 17:58.368
l just want an audition. l'll be Megan Calvet.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.414
Ken, Stan and Ginsberg are gonna be there.
They know who you are.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.627
-l'm gonna call the dentist.
-No. l'm better.

18:09.964 --> 18:13.008
Listen, just forget l brought any of this up.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.260
lt's just...

18:16.304 --> 18:18.972
lt's been so hard, you know.

18:23.936 --> 18:28.023
l do. Look, you don't want it this way.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.234
You wanna be somebody's discovery,
not somebody's wife.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.323
You're right. l know you're right.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.287
-Aren't you gonna get it?
-No. They've been hanging up all day.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.085
Hello?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.254
Who is this?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.673
-Hello, is Marie there?
-Emile?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.384
Marie, s'il vous plait.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.345
lt's your father. l think he's drunk.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.517
Hello?

19:03.726 --> 19:04.851
Daddy's on the phone.

19:08.189 --> 19:10.357
-AIIô, Emile.
-She's got it.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.860
Marie, it's Roger.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.704
Marie, it's Roger Sterling.
l've used up all the French l know.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.340
What is Regina?

19:41.597 --> 19:42.931
Thank you.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.852
Megan, you know l would if l could.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.563
Of course.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.566
l'm gonna take a bath before dinner.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.838
How did you know l was here?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.549
Because Don was complaining
you were drinking all his liquor.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.635
So you wanted to see me?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.429
You could have arranged a dinner
for the four of us.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.598
Really? You'd do that?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.850
No, because l'm not that kind of woman.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.019
No, no, of course you're not.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.770
lt's just, well, l enjoy your company

20:30.855 --> 20:33.732
and l thought if you were willing
to broach impropriety ever so slightly,

20:33.816 --> 20:35.859
l could have dinner
brought to my apartment.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.652
The kid from room service can chaperone.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.697
Room service? ls it a hotel?

20:41.282 --> 20:44.034
The Stanhope.
And you can just ask for me in the lobby.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.327
lt's very discreet.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.370
They just send the girls right up?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.581
Look, l called you.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.459
ln fact, l had hung up on your daughter
about a dozen times today.

20:52.543 --> 20:56.463
l'm not asking for anything more
than a little conversation, l swear.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.050
l'll try to get away

21:00.134 --> 21:03.094
on the condition
that you lower your expectations.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.263
Below conversation?

21:43.094 --> 21:45.095
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.347
How are you feeling?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.474
-Could you get me some ice?
-Right away.

21:49.558 --> 21:53.144
Mrs. Harris wants to see you.
She's been waiting in there quite a while.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.400
Morning.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.652
What can l do for you?

22:02.029 --> 22:05.323
l want to reopen the conversation
about more space.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.033
You're not gonna put anybody
in here, are you?

22:07.368 --> 22:08.368
No.

22:09.161 --> 22:13.498
lt's just l've been trying so hard
to be so responsible and careful

22:13.582 --> 22:16.292
and l don't even know why,

22:16.377 --> 22:19.587
because every day l open the mail
and there's more money.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.715
That's the idea, isn't it?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.134
l got this this morning.

22:28.014 --> 22:31.558
The death benefit
from the company insurance policy.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.561
lt's $1 75,000.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.604
So what's your question?

22:38.983 --> 22:40.775
Why would he do that?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.863
You'll never get an answer.
You can't think about that.

22:45.573 --> 22:49.909
But l do. And then l can't stop it.
What could l have done?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.245
Nothing.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.290
lt's not true.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.918
Why didn't l give him what he wanted?

22:59.712 --> 23:00.879
What did he want?

23:07.720 --> 23:10.096
And now there's this, this profit.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.224
How much did he put in for collateral
after Lucky Strike left?

23:13.768 --> 23:14.851
$50,000.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.394
We should pay that back.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.397
-Shouldn't we have a vote?
-No.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.066
Cut a check to his wife.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.612
Are you under the weather?

23:26.155 --> 23:27.447
l have a hot tooth.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.992
l know a dentist.
He's in the steeple of the Chrysler Building.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.286
Even if he can't help you,
you still get to see the view.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.579
lt'll go away.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.667
l have your ice.

23:40.294 --> 23:41.544
l'll take that.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.422
Put that on your face, not in a drink.

23:56.227 --> 24:00.438
l don't feel well.
Just go to The Cloisters without me.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.536
No, Mother.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.663
l'm sad.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.665
l know.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.169
What do l do?

24:34.807 --> 24:39.102
Why are you always so nice to strangers?
You don't ever care what l wanna do.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.025
You're supposed to be encouraging.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.405
Not every little girl
gets to do what they want.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.324
The world could not support
that many ballerinas.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.702
ls that what you tell yourself?

25:13.971 --> 25:16.389
l'm sorry to drop by like this.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.727
lf l sound distracted, it's only because
l'm waiting for a bed to be delivered.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.146
My mother is coming to stay.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.356
That should be helpful.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.775
-May l?
-Of course.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.697
l'd offer you something,
but l have nothing in the house.

25:36.911 --> 25:39.370
First, let me offer my apologies.

25:39.622 --> 25:42.040
But with the funeral abroad

25:42.124 --> 25:45.210
and you declining our offer
to have a memorial,

25:45.294 --> 25:48.004
l really haven't been sure
how to express our condolences.

25:48.589 --> 25:52.550
lt may be the difference in our cultures,
but we're not ones to wallow.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.763
Well, l'm not sure if you're aware,

25:57.681 --> 26:01.643
but last year the partners
were required to put up collateral.

26:02.186 --> 26:05.021
And although the firm
has six years to repay,

26:05.105 --> 26:09.067
it was unanimous that we try
and help you through this difficult time.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.585
Again, l'm very sorry for your loss.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.880
Yes, l hope you feel better.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.341
l think it'll make a difference.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.509
How much is it?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.135
$50,000.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.973
You had no right to fill
a man like that with ambition.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.979
l found this in his wallet.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.816
Who is this?

26:52.403 --> 26:54.946
-l don't know.
-Don't just consider the office.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.031
Think of all the brothels you frequent.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.702
-l should go.
-Yes, perhaps you should.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.751
l'm truly sorry for your loss.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.753
lt's probably difficult for you to believe,

27:10.838 --> 27:14.924
but it was even more than $50,000
that already belonged to him,

27:15.009 --> 27:16.384
so don't leave here thinking

27:16.468 --> 27:19.095
that you've done anything for anyone
but yourself.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.700
Hello.

27:43.704 --> 27:44.871
Say hi to Daddy.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.167
The table's set in there.
l wanted to leave these out for you.

27:51.462 --> 27:52.545
What is this?

27:53.047 --> 27:54.630
They're the plans for the pool.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.883
They can start in May right after the rain.

27:57.301 --> 27:58.676
That's you.

28:00.054 --> 28:03.222
-l don't know, Trudy. lt's awfully permanent.
-l know.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.391
lt'll add tremendous value to the property.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.685
And Lord knows you're so much better
when you get some sun.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.563
Tammy could drown.

28:10.647 --> 28:11.981
What is wrong with you?

28:12.483 --> 28:13.733
l'm sorry.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.069
This doom and gloom, l'm tired of it.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.797
Not one thing you said was true.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.884
No dinner, no chaperone, no conversation.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.095
Stop being demure.
You're already on the bed.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.186
l hoped that you would call.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.064
And l hoped that you would come.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.316
And not just for obvious reasons.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.277
l don't believe you.

28:59.613 --> 29:04.325
You know, one of my partners,
he ended it all.

29:07.204 --> 29:11.499
You'd have to be so sure you were going
someplace better, wouldn't you?

29:11.583 --> 29:14.544
But l think maybe that place is here.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.297
Why are you saying this?

29:19.466 --> 29:20.842
Would you take LSD with me?

29:22.052 --> 29:23.052
What?

29:23.137 --> 29:26.973
l love that you're so calm,
but you're adventurous.

29:27.933 --> 29:32.937
And honestly, l need to take it again
to really appreciate here

29:33.480 --> 29:35.398
and l don't wanna do it alone.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.734
And l think if you were there,
then it'd be okay.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.614
Roger, please don't ask me for anything.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.325
Please don't ask me to take care of you.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.920
ls there anything else l can do?

30:10.058 --> 30:12.727
There you are, right where you are.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.191
l missed you.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.906
Jesus. Come on.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.366
Let's get you to bed.

30:29.203 --> 30:31.871
-Where's your mother?
-She abandoned me.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.505
You can't even kiss me?

30:40.714 --> 30:45.051
Just go to the dentist,
because l need you right now.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.094
-Megan.
-Please.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.765
lt's the only thing l'm good for.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.017
What the hell happened today?

30:53.519 --> 30:57.855
This is what you want, isn't it?
For me to be waiting for you.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.733
That's why you won't give me a chance.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.027
That's not true.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.488
l know, l know.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.783
Because it's either that or l'm terrible.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.411
But how the hell would you know?

31:12.913 --> 31:14.664
You're really drunk.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.794
Sleep it off.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.597
Where were you?

31:32.099 --> 31:33.474
l have friends in New York.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.269
How could you leave her like that,
drunk out of her mind?

31:36.353 --> 31:39.146
She's married to you. That's yourjob.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.607
She left my house a happy girl.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.818
And you show up and she's miserable.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.571
l know it's hard to watch,

31:46.655 --> 31:49.365
but this is what happens
when you have the artistic temperament

31:49.449 --> 31:51.325
but you are not an artist.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.536
Take my advice,

31:53.620 --> 31:57.498
nurse her through this defeat
and you shall have the life you desire.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.129
l have postcards to write.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.488
You almost had a nasty abscess.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.283
You should have had it extracted days ago.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.660
l kept thinking it would go away.

32:34.745 --> 32:37.538
Yeah? You're lucky you didn't lose yourjaw.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.794
Just breathe through your nose.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.811
You're in bad shape, Dick.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.649
What are you doing here?

33:05.233 --> 33:07.360
l lost my job when l died.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.490
l'm gonna do you a favor and take it out.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.661
But it's not your tooth that's rotten.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.579
Don't go.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.750
Don't leave me.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.087
Don't worry.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.047
l'll hang around.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.799
Get it?

33:36.807 --> 33:41.519
You're gonna be sore,
so just take it easy for the rest of the day.

33:42.270 --> 33:47.066
Fill that prescription l gave you
and don't smoke for 24 hours.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.576
Mrs. Dawes?

33:58.912 --> 34:01.831
Beth, your brother's here to see you.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.210
Yes, of course. Come in.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.259
You know, you're right.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.761
You really do have the same eyes.

34:16.430 --> 34:18.013
l'm so glad you came.

34:21.518 --> 34:22.768
How are you feeling?

34:23.562 --> 34:25.604
l don't have a brother.

34:26.106 --> 34:27.606
lt was the only way l could get in.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.443
But what are you doing here?

34:31.069 --> 34:33.946
Well, l was worried about you.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.033
That's right.

34:43.582 --> 34:44.915
l'm sorry.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.752
l'm in the wrong room.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.879
But you can still visit.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.757
But l'm here to visit my friend.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.009
Please.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.261
Please, keep me company.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.648
What's wrong with your friend?

35:12.861 --> 35:13.986
He...

35:21.328 --> 35:22.870
He got involved

35:24.873 --> 35:26.665
with another man's wife.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.587
And that put him in the hospital?

35:33.089 --> 35:36.467
From the complications.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.680
Why did he do it?

35:44.392 --> 35:48.562
Well, all the regular reasons, l guess.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.357
He needed to let off some steam,

35:51.441 --> 35:54.610
he needed adventure,
he needed to feel handsome again.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.863
He needed to feel that he knew something,

35:58.490 --> 36:00.074
that all this aging was worth something

36:00.158 --> 36:02.827
because he knew things
young people didn't know yet.

36:04.704 --> 36:08.332
He probably thought it would be like
having a few tall drinks

36:08.416 --> 36:10.167
and feeling very, very good.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.920
And then he'd go back to his life and say,

36:15.131 --> 36:16.841
"That was nice."

36:18.593 --> 36:20.386
But then he got sick?

36:22.764 --> 36:24.557
When it went away,

36:26.184 --> 36:27.560
he was heartbroken.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.692
And then he realized everything
he already had was not right either

36:35.694 --> 36:38.571
and that was why it had happened at all.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.701
And that his life with his family was some

36:45.745 --> 36:48.664
temporary bandage on a permanent wound.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.171
Don't worry.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.466
They'll fix him up here.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.052
They're very good.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.601
He'll be fine.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.115
Well, it was nice to meet you.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.452
Good luck with your friend.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.813
Oh, my goodness.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.943
How are you?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.321
-Are you waiting for somebody?
-Nope.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.205
What are you doing here?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.499
-Did you lose yourjob?
-No.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.209
Did you?

38:15.293 --> 38:16.794
You look good.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.421
How's Megan?

38:19.506 --> 38:20.881
She's good.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.218
You're kind of new at that job
to be avoiding the office.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.679
Just knocking out the cobwebs.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.223
Someone told me this works.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.310
So it's going well?

38:34.104 --> 38:35.187
Yeah.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.189
ls that okay?

38:38.942 --> 38:40.901
That's what happens
when you help someone,

38:40.986 --> 38:42.987
they succeed and move on.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.408
Don't you want them to?

38:47.951 --> 38:49.284
l'm proud of you.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.205
l just didn't know it would be without me.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.916
Well, put me on your call list.

38:56.710 --> 38:57.876
What are you working on?

38:58.086 --> 39:00.212
We're trying to get that women's cigarette
you were after.

39:01.381 --> 39:02.715
God, l miss that easy money.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.093
lt's easy to have. lt's not easy to win.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.554
You'll beat it.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.684
Well, l'm going to Virginia
to tour the factory.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.811
l'm going on a plane.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.897
-Richmond's nice.
-lt's not Paris.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.483
And l'm going with Frank Gleason.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.197
-Will you give my love to Megan?
-Sure.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.367
We should all get together.

39:30.869 --> 39:31.910
Yes.

39:39.586 --> 39:40.753
Howdy, partner!

39:42.505 --> 39:44.798
What do you say we get off in Harrison,

39:44.883 --> 39:47.342
get back on the train
and go get into some trouble?

39:47.927 --> 39:49.636
-What?
-l'm on my own.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.765
You can say you fell asleep. You did.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.143
You are the most disgusting person
l have ever seen.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.436
Come on!

39:58.438 --> 40:00.689
How could you do that to that woman?

40:00.774 --> 40:04.193
You just couldn't wait to get her
in the hospital and erase her brain.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.363
lt's you?

40:09.282 --> 40:12.034
She always spreads her legs
for the first chump she can find.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.330
What you doing?

40:16.414 --> 40:17.539
Break it up!

40:20.251 --> 40:23.087
-Knock it off!
-Gentlemen, calm down!

40:23.963 --> 40:25.464
You okay, buddy?

40:25.548 --> 40:27.633
You, Max Schmeling, you go that way.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.134
-He started it.
-Out!

40:29.511 --> 40:32.096
-My things are in the bar.
-That's not a surprise.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.974
You're a real prick, you know that?

40:37.435 --> 40:39.061
Listen, buddy, you're gonna
give it a couple of minutes,

40:39.145 --> 40:40.521
you're gonna go down there and apologize.

40:40.605 --> 40:41.980
To him?

40:42.065 --> 40:43.107
Never.

40:43.233 --> 40:45.484
You gotta ride the train every day
and he's a fellow commuter.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.777
And l don't like fighting on my train.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.028
lt's your train.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.324
Are you paying to ride on it?
We're paying you to ride on it.

40:52.408 --> 40:55.285
You work for us, so why don't you
go down there and apologize to him?

40:55.370 --> 40:58.497
-l'm about to throw you off.
-Go ahead, you fat piece of crap.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.166
l am an officer of the New Haven line.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.336
Well, l'm president
of the Howdy Doody circus army.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.880
-That's it, come on. You're coming...
-Get your hands off me!

41:11.511 --> 41:13.137
You can't do that!

41:13.930 --> 41:16.181
Get off the train. Harrison!

41:16.516 --> 41:18.517
Next stop, Harrison.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.524
What on earth happened?
Were you in another car accident?

41:25.650 --> 41:27.734
The car's fine. There's not a scratch on it.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.320
l'm not worried about the car.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.489
My goodness, look at you.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.534
l fell asleep and ran into a ditch.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.119
Come with me.

41:43.293 --> 41:44.751
l can't live like this.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.130
Knowing you're out there working so hard

41:48.214 --> 41:50.716
and then wondering if you're going to
come home and in what condition.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.218
l'll come home.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.598
l think you were right.

41:58.474 --> 41:59.725
And first thing tomorrow morning,

41:59.809 --> 42:02.394
we're going to find you
an apartment in the city.

43:41.286 --> 43:44.496
l think this is where the staircase goes.

43:49.002 --> 43:51.628
l'm going to have
the same view as you, Don.

43:52.714 --> 43:54.339
Congratulations.

44:03.391 --> 44:05.642
There she is. There's our Beauty.

44:06.019 --> 44:07.894
Nice to see you again.

44:08.521 --> 44:09.938
You look perfect.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.483
-When do we start?
-When they're ready.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.032
l can't believe this is happening.

44:20.825 --> 44:22.200
Miss Calvet, would you step in, please?

44:24.620 --> 44:26.371
You know l love you.

44:31.753 --> 44:33.045
Rehearsal in five.

45:12.085 --> 45:14.086
Give me an Old Fashioned.

46:12.812 --> 46:14.938
Excuse me, do you have a light?

46:22.655 --> 46:23.989
Thank you.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.909
l'm sorry, but my friend down there,

46:30.621 --> 46:32.372
she was wondering.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.500
Are you alone?
