<i>Public relations.</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:22.840
<i>The professional maintenance</i>
<i>of a favourable public image.</i>

00:22.880 --> 00:25.840
It's a top restaurant
with two Michelin stars

00:25.880 --> 00:28.040
and there's footage
of rats in the kitchen.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.400
I'm saying we need a hell
of a way to manage this.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.000
<i>Issues management.</i>

00:32.040 --> 00:35.880
<i>The process of responding</i>

Yes?

00:40.080 --> 00:42.440
<i>About to be required</i>
<i>with my family.</i>

00:42.440 --> 00:43.520
Come.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.280
I'm putting out a press release
for rat kitchen.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.120
Meanwhile, I'm definitely
cancelling my lunch booking.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.200
That's funny.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.640
You still able to fly, yes?

00:52.680 --> 00:55.960
Uh, about a week
before bub grounds me.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.040
They tell me this is your
sister.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.320
All this from a little painting
in a little school

01:04.360 --> 01:05.760
in the middle of nowhere.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.400
Yeah, a pretty public statement.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.040
I mean,
I shouldn't be surprised.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.120
But when it's your own family
going viral...

01:11.160 --> 01:12.800
Observation Earth want to talk.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.920
They think Ruby
has Thunberg potential.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.280
Get out of town.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.880
I was hoping you might like to.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.360
I want you to go to Australia,
assess the prospect,

01:20.400 --> 01:21.800
they want to broker a deal.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.200
Observation Earth's
not my client.

01:25.280 --> 01:29.640
Justin will take the lead.
You... finesse your family.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.720
My family is un-finesse-able.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.240
Come on.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.000
Are you sure I'm needed?

01:40.040 --> 01:41.840
I wouldn't have asked
if you weren't.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.360
Just introduce Justin to them,
them to the family,

01:44.400 --> 01:46.920
then come straight back.
I cannot spare you, OK?

01:49.960 --> 01:51.040
OK.

01:53.960 --> 01:58.760
I haven't been home in years.
Can I have a few extra days.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.920
It's work, actually.
It's not a reunion.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.360
You're such a sentimentalist.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.880
Yeah, soft as steel.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.560
OK. Three days. Enjoy.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.160
Fine.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.960
Right.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.600
<i>Going home.</i>

02:17.680 --> 02:21.320
<i>Eight years here</i>
<i>and I still say 'home'.</i>

02:32.320 --> 02:35.560
<i>The thing about video calls,</i>
<i>theyâ€™re from the shoulders up.</i>

02:35.600 --> 02:39.160
<i>You get to show the world</i>
<i>only what you want it to see.</i>

02:39.160 --> 02:41.680
<i>Smoke and mirrors.</i>

02:51.080 --> 02:53.560
What? Ah! Ah!

02:53.600 --> 02:54.920
Rachel's coming.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.080
What... when? When do you get
here? How long can you stay?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.440
Five days at most.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.360
It'll depend on how
long it takes

03:01.400 --> 03:03.200
Observation Earth
to sign Ruby.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.320
Sign?

03:04.360 --> 03:05.840
She's gone viral.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.000
I know, it's crazy, but poo as
protest -

03:08.040 --> 03:09.640
it's a new spin.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.600
Greedy old white men,
poor white bears. Classic.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.120
Observation Earth?
Well, they can't be serious.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.960
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.720
Well, it's a flash in the pan,
isn't it?

03:20.760 --> 03:22.480
It's all over social
media.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.200
If they sign Rubes as a youth
ambassador, that would be huge.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.720
That's ridiculous!

03:28.760 --> 03:30.440
I'll understand if you say no.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.080
Sweetheart, I'm gonna say
anything

03:32.120 --> 03:33.240
to get you on that plane.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.400
OK.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.600
Um, I can't talk long. Can you
put Dad on before I go?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.240
Uh...he's not here.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.640
I'm in the city and Dad's in
Buradeena.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.480
Oh, you don't have to make a
special trip.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.560
- That works well, then.
- Exactly.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.840
There's so much to catch up on.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.320
There is.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.400
Oh, I can't wait to see you!

03:54.440 --> 03:57.520
- I love you!
- Love you too.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.560
Mwah!

04:10.040 --> 04:11.240
Oh, Jules, I don't know.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.200
Neither do I.
Trust me.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.640
There's a lot of haters gunning
for that Greta kid.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.720
Do we want something
like that for Rubes?

04:17.760 --> 04:20.320
Yeah, but if we put the
kybosh on it straight away,

04:20.360 --> 04:21.360
Rachel won't come.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.560
And you never know - she might
make sense of it.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.560
Ruby an international
ambassador?

04:27.600 --> 04:31.240
Maybe...you're right.
Anything to get Rach home.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.360
- Ruby know?
- No, better Rachel explains.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.160
So, she gets in Sunday morning.
What time will you drive down?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.720
Well, she's never seen
Buradeena.

04:38.760 --> 04:39.920
Why doesn't she come here?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.760
Well, because she's only got
a few days

04:41.800 --> 04:43.080
and she'll have work to do.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.560
Jules, someone could drive her.
Or she could fly up.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.560
- Are we really gonna do this?
- Do what?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.120
Well, she hasn't been back in
years

04:51.160 --> 04:53.160
and you're being stubborn
for the sake of it!

04:53.200 --> 04:55.320
I want her to see our home.
If she can't make it,

04:55.360 --> 04:56.880
of course
I'll come down there.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.440
It's not like I'd miss
seeing her.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.240
Good. Fine.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.520
This is the arrangement.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.120
This is how it works.
I'm here. You're there.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.000
I just want her to understand
what I love about this place.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.640
OK. We'll dial you in, then.
Sunday lunch.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.240
So the golden child returns.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.480
I thought you thought
that was you.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.920
Yeah, it is. Always was.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.920
Rachel just hasn't
figured that out yet.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.240
Ta-da!

05:22.240 --> 05:24.320
OK, that needs work.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
There's too much head.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.800
Don't even go there.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.000
Keep it up.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.360
- Uh...
- Or there.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.000
You got a smutty mind.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.440
Ah! Hey. Did you get
the meme I sent ya?

05:35.480 --> 05:39.280
Which one? You're gonna use up
all my data at this rate.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.280
Memes? What are you, 12?

05:42.320 --> 05:44.680
It was a psychology joke!
It was funny.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.360
Debatable.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.080
So what's the deal?

05:51.600 --> 05:52.880
We have a laugh.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.040
Oh! They were so bloody serious
at the old job.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.360
Paid more, though.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.520
Thank you for saving my arse.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.840
No worries.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.040
You, me, Sydney.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.400
So it seems.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.560
Try to sound enthusiastic.
Come on.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.160
Long story. It's complicated.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.600
OK. I'll see you
in the lounge.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.920
Since you're meeting the family

06:17.960 --> 06:22.280
and in case it becomes an issue,
I haven't told them.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.040
About...the baby.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.120
I thought it would be easier
with the final result to show.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.920
You know your family.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.720
My mother at least.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.160
- That bad?
- That good.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.120
She kills with kindness.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.640
I'll get you up
to speed on the flight.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.360
There'll be no over-share.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.280
Whatever is required
to do the job.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.240
<i>My main job is to turn</i>
<i>this into a positive.</i>

06:50.280 --> 06:51.800
<i>And to get on that plane.</i>

06:55.960 --> 06:58.880
We should see if Rachel
wants to do the bridge climb.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.920
Or do I just get tickets and
surprise her?

07:01.960 --> 07:03.760
She's not a tourist.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.920
She said once
she's never done it.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.160
Do you think it's too much

07:08.200 --> 07:10.200
if I organise lunch,
just the three of us?

07:10.240 --> 07:14.400
And, um, maybe
a her-and-me spa date.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.400
Whatever makes you happy.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.160
It's good to see you happy.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.120
It'll be nice to really get to
know her.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.760
Book it all in. Enjoy
your IVF downtime.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.680
Every conversation, IVF
said or hovering as a subtext.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.280
I'm sure he doesn't
mean to do it.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.840
He thinks that staying positive

07:35.880 --> 07:37.520
is going to get us
over the line.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.600
I mean, women get pregnant every
day.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.360
Nothing to do with
their attitude.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.120
Their bodies
work - mine doesn't.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.560
So if this really is
the end of the line...

07:45.600 --> 07:48.840
Only one of my eggs fertilised
last time. One out of eight.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.240
Well, you're gonna have to
say how you're feeling.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.040
It's not an issue until we can
afford another cycle.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.600
That makes evasion easy.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.800
Your brother-in-law.

08:00.840 --> 08:01.920
What's he done?

08:01.960 --> 08:04.640
It's like he's decided
I'm his new best friend,

08:04.680 --> 08:06.880
which I didn't get any say in.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.200
He spamming me
with lame jokes all day.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.800
You think he's hitting on you?

08:11.840 --> 08:13.120
I can't get a read yet.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.520
He might just be happy
to be out of his old job.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.360
Do you want me to tell
him to give it a rest?

08:17.400 --> 08:18.600
Oh, I can handle it.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.720
Thanks. 'Cause that
would've been awkward.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.320
- Oh, yeah.
- Again?

08:22.360 --> 08:23.640
Again.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.040
'Trying' is right.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.040
- Welcome to the Anderson.
- Thank you.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.200
We'll look after your
bags.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.320
So I'll contact the client.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.280
Good luck with your family.

08:51.320 --> 08:56.000
About that -
would you mind coming?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.480
You can see Ruby in
situ before we do the meeting.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.320
Would it help with your reveal?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.640
It'll control the questions.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.240
You can say no.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.760
Like you said, meet Ruby.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.360
- If I'm being unfair...
- I'd say no.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.120
Ah! She'll be here in a minute.
Can you set the table please?

09:17.160 --> 09:19.520
I'm the whole reason she's
coming.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.160
Why am I the one doing
the work?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.280
How do you know that?

09:23.320 --> 09:24.520
Don't look at us.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.760
Have you seen the size
of this place?

09:26.840 --> 09:29.520
It's not like anyone can
have a private conversation.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.360
Yes, well, nothing's been
decided yet.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.760
We're just going to talk about

09:32.840 --> 09:34.360
what Observation Earth
has in mind

09:34.400 --> 09:35.880
and then we'll take it from
there.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.120
But any attitude from you

09:37.160 --> 09:39.480
and your father and I won't be
agreeing to anything.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.040
So set the table, please.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.640
Thank you.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.640
A taxi!

09:44.720 --> 09:48.080
Oh, get your father on the line.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.240
I'm here.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.640
Oh! She's here!

09:57.200 --> 09:59.520
Hey, family. I'm home.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.720
So good to see you.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.200
Ow!

10:03.240 --> 10:06.000
Oh, my god.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.440
Surprise.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.880
- Dave?
- I can see.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.600
- Is she?
- Yep.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.760
Why didn't you tell us?

10:13.760 --> 10:16.400
How did it even happen? You said
you weren't seeing anyone.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.520
This is Justin.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.840
- Justin.
- Justin?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.200
- Hi.
- Justin.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.080
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.760
Just Justin.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.320
Justin Gavin. Nothing to do
with anything else.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.880
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.200
- Here to handle the account.
- Good to meet you all.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.320
So...

10:41.360 --> 10:42.760
..who is the father?

10:42.760 --> 10:45.480
<i>Issues management,</i>
<i>starting now.</i>

10:45.520 --> 10:47.840
OK, this is to keep you
going.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.080
We've got things to talk
about.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.040
- He's here for me.
- Later.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.840
Rachel not saying
anything is off.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.400
And that comment is exactly why
you're in here.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.720
And you're not thinking it?

10:57.760 --> 10:59.880
First things first - stay.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.080
Totally off.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.560
Dad is in the house.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.400
I wasn't going to keep
it a secret forever.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.960
Well, that's comforting.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.680
It's good to see New York hasn't
made you any less out-there.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.960
This pretty much resets
the bar, though.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.240
It was unexpected.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.680
I'm still having trouble
figuring it out myself.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.840
Ah... sorry, Justin,

11:25.880 --> 11:28.640
that you've been dragged
into this family flurry.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.960
- I'm fine.
- No, we should finish it later.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.600
- Probably best.
- Mm.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.840
Lunch is almost ready.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.360
Thanks, Cass.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.080
I'll help.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.800
I keep meaning
to ask you...

11:45.840 --> 11:47.400
Rach must bring up thoughts.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.240
I'm fine, babe.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.040
You're not. I get it.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.000
I'll let you go, Rachel.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.480
We can talk tomorrow to decide
when you're coming up.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.120
As soon as we've
finalised the deal.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.880
I really want you
to see our place,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.320
if you're up to it, that is.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.120
I'll only be able
to stay a night.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.960
You fly to Taree.
I'll pick you up.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.360
You're welcome too, Justin.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
Oh, no leave for me
but thanks for the offer.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.280
As long as I make
my New York flight back.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.040
OK. Talk tomorrow.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.200
What's the deal with you guys -
Mum here, you there.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.720
You guys
splitting up?

12:22.800 --> 12:25.520
No.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.840
I cannot believe
you said nothing.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.760
Oh! I think you've won
that competition.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.800
Your dad and I
are not separating.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.560
We're together,
but for the moment

12:38.600 --> 12:41.080
we're choosing to live
in different locations.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.640
Well, long distance never works.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.200
Look what happened
to me and Jake.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.480
Oh, Dad and I have got a lot
more runs on the board

12:46.520 --> 12:47.880
than you and Jake had.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.320
So...

12:51.920 --> 12:54.240
The father?

12:55.160 --> 12:58.040
It was two people
getting messy at a function.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.440
- Oh.
- He's married.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.560
Right.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.760
That's the look I've been trying
to avoid.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.960
What? Oh... Mild disapproval?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.120
It's hardly a reason for
keeping us in the dark.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.320
You can't be that ashamed.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.040
Can we just leave it until the
Ruby business is out of the way?

13:14.080 --> 13:15.680
Oh, so that's why
you brought Justin -

13:15.720 --> 13:17.120
so we couldn't talk about this?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.240
He's here to meet the family.
I'm here for work.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.320
Like I said, when that's done.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.840
Food's ready.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.640
Can we talk about
Observation Earth?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.120
I thought you weren't going to
tell her.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.520
Carbo says we need to move fast
on something like this.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.280
Carbo knows as well?

13:33.320 --> 13:35.400
I've set up a meeting for
tomorrow afternoon.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.920
Yes! Whoo!

13:37.760 --> 13:38.840
Just us.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.800
You are opening Pandora's box.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.840
Boston College, that's pretty
fancy, isn't it?

13:47.880 --> 13:50.280
Sounds like it should be fancy.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.720
It's a decent school. Yeah.

13:52.760 --> 13:57.160
So you're on Rachel's team in
New York or... How does that work?

13:57.200 --> 14:00.200
Well, your sister handles some
pretty impressive clients.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.200
I'm always hoping to get to work
with her.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.880
Justin was snapped up
by the company

14:03.920 --> 14:05.160
even before he graduated.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.240
I told you there'd be an
interrogation.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.520
I'm just being polite.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.520
Sounds like you're really
on the fast track.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.600
My dad works in a bar.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.040
I've just started there.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.200
I did bar gigs
all through college.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.760
OK, let's huddle up for a pic.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.240
It's not often I get all my kids

14:27.280 --> 14:30.240
in the same room at
the same time, so...

14:30.960 --> 14:32.680
You too, Justin.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.680
Mum! It's a family
snap.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.240
And let me take it.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.680
Oh, that's very nice of
you.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.680
Everyone smile.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.560
Cheesy.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.200
<i>A happy family pic,</i>

14:51.240 --> 14:53.680
<i>with a glaring lack</i>
<i>of transparency.</i>

15:06.880 --> 15:09.560
<i>Now more than 70 years old.</i>

15:09.600 --> 15:11.640
<i>And you gotta say that the</i>
<i>defense this year</i>

15:11.680 --> 15:13.040
<i>has been quite outstanding.</i>

15:13.080 --> 15:15.600
<i>The communication,</i>
<i>the offensive tackling,</i>

15:15.640 --> 15:16.960
<i>but also the kick chase.</i>

15:17.000 --> 15:18.480
Yoo-hoo!

15:18.520 --> 15:19.800
Hello?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.520
Congratulations, Grandpa.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.440
Paddo's got a big mouth.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.040
Paddo couldn't help it.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.360
Thought you might need it.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.840
Won't say no. Thanks.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.960
Paddo tells me that Rachel's
got a bloke with her.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.240
Yeah, not the father.
No word on that score.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.560
Mmm. So you going down there?

15:38.600 --> 15:40.280
What would that change?

15:40.320 --> 15:44.240
Well, you don't think Julie
might need the backup?

15:44.280 --> 15:46.600
She's got it. I'm right here.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.360
She says we need to be there
for the kids.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.880
But Rachel can't even
be bothered

15:52.920 --> 15:54.360
to tell us that she's pregnant!

15:54.400 --> 15:56.200
And Nathan throws in a good job

15:56.240 --> 15:58.480
for bar work
without even a word.

15:58.520 --> 16:02.200
The kids are happy
making their own decisions.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.880
So, are you happy?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.120
Y'know, you here and Julie
there?

16:10.160 --> 16:12.600
I'm making it work so far.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.480
This is going to make me a bit
too happy.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.120
- Not a bad drop.
- Cheers.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.280
Yeah, of course I'm
not happy about Julie

16:25.320 --> 16:29.600
but I'm happy in Buradeena.
It's home.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.520
Hey, there's a show on telly I
was gonna watch.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.880
Oh, yeah.
Don't let me keep you.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.600
Well, just if you want to take a
look - it's a new crime thing.

16:37.640 --> 16:41.040
- Got good reviews.
- It's only early. Why not?

16:41.080 --> 16:42.760
Got the bottle to finish.
Cheers.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.280
Cheers.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.760
I'll pick you up at
two.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.360
Well, as long as you can manage
Ruby's expectations.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.040
She's already starting to strut.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.440
Leave it to big sis.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.800
Oh, and um, don't forget to
call your dad.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.480
Why don't you come too?

17:03.520 --> 17:06.760
Uh, no, we're just
settling into this.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.800
Your father is best left as is.

17:08.840 --> 17:11.000
Sorry for
the warts and all night.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.720
You should meet my family.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.640
Plus I need to know you
to sell you.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.080
Well, I feel like we're
in good hands.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.560
I tell you what,
I'll get Ben and Nathan

17:19.560 --> 17:21.400
to organise a boys' night out.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.880
- Mum!

17:22.920 --> 17:24.720
- Oh! Some real
Aussie nightlife.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.560
Seeing Ruby's gene pool
in action? I look forward to it.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.040
I'm so happy to see you.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.920
And I'm here for you.
You know that. In any way.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.040
I do.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.080
Bye.

17:53.080 --> 17:56.760
See what I mean? You do not need
to go out with my brothers.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.320
- Might be fun.
- Doubt it.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.240
They're nice.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.920
They're mine.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.480
Guess the bridge climb
is off then?

18:57.520 --> 18:59.800
- Mmm. - It would make
one hell of a birth story.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.800
- You got an alternative?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.280
I'll see.
We shouldn't monopolise her.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.440
You were psyched about us
hanging out with her.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.560
I don't think
we should tire her out.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.800
I really need this run.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.240
So no one had any idea?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.520
Huge surprise.

19:17.560 --> 19:21.400
Ben thinks I'm upset because
she's pregnant. Typical.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.720
So why are you, then?

19:26.880 --> 19:29.560
He's gonna project the baby bump
onto me

19:29.640 --> 19:31.240
and it's going to
be 10 times worse.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.320
This is turning into a thing.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.480
- I guess.
- You need to sort it.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.240
- In here.
- When I have to.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.880
I mean, this has been
our entire focus

19:43.920 --> 19:45.760
and now I'm
the one jumping ship.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.160
Oh.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.640
Oh, not Nathan again.

19:49.680 --> 19:55.240
Come on.
That's the best one yet, right?

19:55.280 --> 19:57.800
Nathan, you're spamming
her.

19:57.800 --> 20:01.320
Just read the signs, she's not
into it. Get some boundaries.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.440
So as you know, the idea is we
will have youth ambassadors

20:16.480 --> 20:17.480
throughout the world.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.240
The earth is your inheritance

20:19.280 --> 20:21.080
and currently,
it's being spent for you.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.640
Obviously, that's where Ruby's
artwork fits right in.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.760
And I've got a million
ideas for new paintings.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.080
Well, too few people
pick up after their dog

20:28.080 --> 20:30.520
so she won't be running out of
materials anytime soon.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.400
Too few pick up
after themselves

20:32.440 --> 20:34.200
so she won't be
running out of dilemmas.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.920
Ah! There is a punchline
in that.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.160
There is. You're fully on board
though, Mrs. Rafter?

20:39.200 --> 20:42.320
- Well, I...
- Mum and Dad are so on board.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.320
Ah, obviously we're very mindful
of Ruby's age.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.320
So, I'd say that we're
proceeding cautiously.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.080
But we also know
that it's something

20:50.080 --> 20:51.560
she's very passionate about.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.560
And having a family member
as a point person

20:53.560 --> 20:54.640
is a huge plus, Rachel.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.480
Justin takes point. I'm here to
get you out the gates.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.480
Of course.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.440
You're in extremely
good hands with him.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.640
With us.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.160
- Great.
- Awesome.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.440
I call that a 10.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.400
Well, they seem
fairly committed.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.080
All done bar the
signing.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.720
- Carbo!
- Hey!

21:11.760 --> 21:12.880
Where were you?

21:12.920 --> 21:15.520
Ah, I couldn't get up.
Hey, Rach. Whoa!

21:15.560 --> 21:16.800
Love the new look.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.640
- Hey. Carbo.
- Justin.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.480
- You would've seen my stuff.
- I have.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.080
So, ah, we signed the deal?
Be good to stream it.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.320
I've got over a million
followers and counting.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.440
I gave my name
to the security guard over there

21:27.480 --> 21:29.680
but he must've got in touch with
some assistant.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.320
I'll sort this. You guys go
ahead.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.240
Yeah, come on, we'll wait
outside.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.240
- Carbo should've come up.
- Later, Rubes.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.560
Come on, darling.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.720
- Carbo.
- Yeah.

21:38.760 --> 21:42.240
I gave word not
to let you upstairs.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.640
How come?

21:43.680 --> 21:46.240
We're still in the middle of
negotiations.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.320
And if you barge in there,

21:47.400 --> 21:49.480
you could blow the whole
thing out of the water.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.320
Yeah, but I wanted to show them
our merch. Look - fridge magnet.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.400
'Oh Poo!' Good name, eh?

21:53.440 --> 21:55.080
One word, Carbo. 'Landfill.'

21:55.080 --> 21:56.280
Do you really think

21:56.320 --> 21:58.720
that's the brand strategy
Observation Earth are going for?

21:58.760 --> 22:01.160
They wouldn't even know about
her if it wasn't for me.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.120
Nothing like this is going
anywhere near the campaign.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.160
It's good to see you, though.
How's Retta and Theo?

22:14.200 --> 22:15.960
Fine.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.680
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.240
- Where's the American accent?
- Left it in Manhattan.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.520
Ah.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.280
I know you mean well, Carbo.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.240
- Carbo coming?
- No, he's not a part of this.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.160
- He should be.
- He's not.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.280
Ah well... you know what?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.320
Why don't we get you a treat on
the way home?

22:36.360 --> 22:37.640
That's a great idea.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.040
- I'll call you.
- I'll write it up for Max.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.920
Now, I know
you've probably got everything,

23:02.960 --> 23:05.080
but Grandma reserves
the right to contribute.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.600
- It's organic cotton.
- It's adorable.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.240
I actually haven't bought
anything, yet.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.440
What? You know it's not staying
in there forever.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.720
Mmm. The doctor did mention
something about that.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.400
I'm not having kids when I get
older.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.160
It's irresponsible
to overpopulate the planet.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.280
Well, take it from me,
the first bottle of champagne

23:24.320 --> 23:26.960
might seem like a good idea,
but the second one never is.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.640
We shouldn't be over consuming
anything

23:32.680 --> 23:34.480
in a world of finite resources.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.040
Pretty sure that's not what you
meant.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.680
Mmm.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.160
Oh.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.600
It's very cute.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.080
Seriously. Put it away.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.920
Cassie doesn't need it.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.840
- She seems fine.
- You bring stuff up.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.280
I don't mean to.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.720
Hard not to.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.880
I'm going to pick up Justin.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.760
Is this really necessary?

24:01.800 --> 24:02.840
Just being nice.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.240
Where are you taking him?

24:04.280 --> 24:05.320
The Boat Club.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.680
Oh, Ben!

24:06.720 --> 24:09.160
If it's good enough for us,
it's good enough for him.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.320
Best seafood platter
in Australia.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.800
Ben's just being overprotective.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.040
Can't blame him.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.680
The IVF put a huge strain on
both of them.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.760
Yeah, I'm sure.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.600
I just need to put my foot in it
with Nathan

24:24.640 --> 24:26.240
and I'll have
the sibling trifecta.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.160
- Oh, you're doing fine.
- Am I?

24:29.200 --> 24:30.920
Under the circumstances.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.320
Of course you see life
differently to us.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.720
I'm still me.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.880
Filtered through
years of New York.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.520
Sounds like a judgment.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.960
No. You wanted the world,
you went out and got it.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.040
And no one is more proud
of you than I am.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.440
- You are?
- Of course.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.640
Proud and puzzled.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.120
Back at you.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.680
Your dad and I will make it
through this.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.520
You know what?
Neither conversation for now.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.880
We will have them.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.760
We will.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.120
How about we go and see your
grandad after dinner.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.600
I'd love that.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.600
There you go.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.600
What does that involve?

25:18.640 --> 25:20.400
You can't just pull that
out!

25:22.240 --> 25:25.120
So dejected and dispirited,
ladies.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.360
Listen to you
and your big words.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.960
Ay, my parents spent
a lot of money on my education.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.160
Just making sure they
get their money's worth.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.440
So, is this a side hustle?

25:33.480 --> 25:36.920
I waitress on the weekends,
extra cash for the deposit.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.920
Right! Property investor?

25:38.960 --> 25:40.560
Good luck with that.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.840
What's your main gig
during the week?

25:42.880 --> 25:45.760
This! This is the main hustle.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.960
Not side.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.400
Good for you.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.080
So, tell us more about
your fun-employment.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.880
You should've seen the
shutters come down.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.760
Not happening.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.880
Tell me about it!

25:59.920 --> 26:01.200
Yeah, and it's same as Anna.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.840
- Anna?
- Yeah!

26:02.880 --> 26:04.880
- Then Cassie has a go at me.
- Cassie?

26:04.920 --> 26:06.440
Yeah! She was like,
'Boundaries!'

26:06.480 --> 26:07.560
'Boundaries!' she says.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.840
It was like... It's a couple of
memes. Bloody hell.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.280
Rach had a go at me!

26:11.320 --> 26:12.880
Nothing wrong with scoring likes
on the socials,

26:12.920 --> 26:15.920
but my one million followers
and blue tick? Not good enough.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.720
What do you know?
The whizz kid's arrived.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.520
I'm not sure if he's on
Rachel's side.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.760
What do you reckon?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.640
- Player.
- Player?

26:29.680 --> 26:31.840
- You think?
- I know.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.240
Ooh.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.840
I know his type.

26:41.240 --> 26:42.520
Hey!

26:42.560 --> 26:45.640
- Look who's here.
- Hey, Grandad!

26:45.680 --> 26:48.720
So good to see you.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.920
What are you doing here?

26:50.960 --> 26:52.040
What's she doing here?

26:52.080 --> 26:53.240
Dad, it's Rachel.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.400
I know who it is.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.000
I told you she was coming.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.520
Too little, too late.

26:57.560 --> 26:58.920
She's here for work, Dad.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.640
- Oh, that'd be right.
- Not just work.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.040
It wouldn't be for us.
You couldn't even turn up

27:03.080 --> 27:06.120
to your mum and dad's own
anniversary, Miss Hoity-Toity.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.360
Dad!

27:07.400 --> 27:10.760
I mean, we got here.
Where were you?

27:10.800 --> 27:13.240
I called in, remember?

27:13.280 --> 27:15.480
I remember well enough.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.760
Haven't lost my marbles yet.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.480
Whatever you might
hear around here.

27:18.520 --> 27:21.400
And you couldn't even be
bothered to dress up.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.320
I mean, 35 years married

27:23.360 --> 27:25.800
and you're sitting there
in your bloody pajamas.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.040
Dad, it was night there.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.960
It was night here too
but we made an effort.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.240
Rachel woke up especially.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.680
You always cut
her too much slack.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.200
'Julie spoils her,'
your mother always said that.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.480
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

27:37.520 --> 27:40.400
New York.
You're hardly ever home.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.520
Ungrateful, that's
what I call it.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.640
Dad, that's not fair.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.920
It's fair enough to me.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.480
- Can't you be happy that she's...
- It's OK, Mum.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.200
Guess what, Grandad?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.880
I'm having a baby.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.800
Look. See?

28:07.560 --> 28:11.400
It's your first
great-granddaughter.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.880
A girl?

28:15.920 --> 28:17.440
Yeah.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.120
Your mum never said.
You never said.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.280
It's nicer as a
surprise, isn't it?

28:25.320 --> 28:26.680
I reckon.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.720
A really, really good surprise.

28:30.760 --> 28:34.000
A lovely one.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.120
Our little Rachel.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.360
You're gonna have your own
little girl, love.

28:43.400 --> 28:47.040
- A new little Rafter.
- Ah.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.600
I call that bonza.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.720
I call that bloody bonza,
Grandad.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.120
I should've warned you.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.560
You weren't to know.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.000
I was hoping for the best.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.560
Never really sure
what to expect.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.560
You handled it well.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.360
How do you handle it?

29:19.320 --> 29:22.840
How do you stand him
not being the dad you knew?

29:22.880 --> 29:25.680
You don't have a choice
when someone you love changes.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.640
That wasn't directed at you.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.280
But it's applicable.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.720
Well, it would help if
I knew more.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.280
When you're ready...

29:38.920 --> 29:41.200
Time for that talk.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.920
It wasn't one night, Mum.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.720
It was an affair.

29:56.760 --> 30:00.000
He said he was
going to leave his wife.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.800
And instead he gave me a check
and the name of a good doctor

30:02.840 --> 30:04.640
when I told him.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.800
And a sudden turn
of the cold shoulder.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.600
I ripped up the check
and considered the doctor.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.840
Couldn't face another abortion.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.240
I wanted another woman's
husband.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.240
And I just... I didn't need your
disapproval.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.920
I would've kept my distance.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.320
- Mum...
- I would've been excited.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.920
- Of course I would've been.
- I didn't need your excitement.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.240
Once the baby is born,
when I'm so full of serotonin

30:40.280 --> 30:42.200
that I can't help but be
excited, then sure.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.680
Well, I try not to interfere.

30:43.720 --> 30:47.080
Yeah, but you do, Mum.
It's who you are.

30:47.120 --> 30:51.520
Like now. Did you ask Nathan
and Ben if they need you here?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.200
But here you are.
And Dad's back there.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.920
It's more than just that.

30:55.960 --> 30:59.280
I know, but that's
how it's playing out.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.600
You can't help it.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.320
Your default position is mother.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.520
I didn't need you
defaulting with me.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.600
- I see.
- That was cruel.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.360
No.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.560
When the baby's born,
I can't wait to show Granny.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.640
- Of course I can't.
- Of course.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.840
You need to hear
your dad's side of things.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.520
I do.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.080
And we both need a cuppa.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.600
Is he coming back with those
drinks anytime soon?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.600
I think he's got other things on
his mind.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.800
They're just talking.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.880
Oh! She is all over
him.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.960
He's young, he single.
They're alright.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.840
There's no boundaries there.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.520
You reckon he's
sucking up to Rach?

31:51.560 --> 31:53.640
- Yeah, of course he is.
- As if you'd know.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.080
I know his type.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.880
All over us, smooth as silk,
cred points with the boss...

31:58.920 --> 32:00.880
I don't think she's his boss.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.240
You know what I mean.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.960
Sucking his way up the ladder.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.040
- Mate.
- Oh, no.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.400
- It's funny.
- You barely even talked to him.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.720
Yeah because he's
been chatting up Anna.

32:12.760 --> 32:13.640
Ah-ha.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.400
I thought he was
coming out with us. Mmm.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.160
I think he needs a hand
with those drinks.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.920
Better idea.
We're gonna go home.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.440
- No!
- Yes.

32:23.480 --> 32:26.160
- No!
- Yes. Yes.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.120
Oh! Go get 'em, Natho.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.920
Hey!
Ooh.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.440
Bucket list, big time.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.280
I definitely want to
get there one day.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.720
Look me up if you do.

32:37.760 --> 32:41.160
A woman of principle.
That's what I like to see!

32:41.200 --> 32:43.600
Oh, Nathan,
I was just bringing these over.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.240
'Boundaries' she says.
Gotta respect the boundaries.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.640
I guess that changes when
they're young and hot, huh?

32:49.680 --> 32:52.000
Just... goes out
the window.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.800
Boundaries!
Can't even spell it.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.360
- OK, we're out of here.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.840
Oh, if he's got something to
say, don't hold back.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.720
Honestly, ignore him.
I'm just gonna put him in a cab.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.200
I got this.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.840
If you were egging him on,
you both need a good kick.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.800
For the record, I wasn't.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.560
And Nathan needs his face
slapped.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.160
You're a bloody player.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.000
If that's what you think.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.280
That's exactly what a player
would say. I know you.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.640
You see, I used to be you.

33:22.680 --> 33:26.160
The whole world, it was there
for the taking...

33:27.200 --> 33:29.920
Enjoy it on the way down.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.560
Oh! And what was that bullshit

33:33.600 --> 33:35.440
about rocking up
to our place, huh?

33:35.480 --> 33:38.200
What, are you looking
for a promotion?

33:54.360 --> 33:55.880
Thanks for the heads up.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.120
Edward's in
with us for the night.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.400
Here we go.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.200
Ooh. Ooh!
There you go, sweetheart.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.720
- Got the bucket.
- Love you, Mum.

34:06.760 --> 34:10.040
Every night
in every town in Australia.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.000
It's an Aussie male ritual.

34:12.040 --> 34:15.360
I did want to meet the
family.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.840
<i>When we find</i>
<i>ourselves in damage control,</i>

34:23.880 --> 34:26.080
<i>it's tempting to just</i>
<i>paper over the cracks.</i>

34:26.120 --> 34:29.440
<i>But first step's</i>
<i>making it right.</i>

34:29.480 --> 34:33.400
Oh. Mum said you were
heading up to see Dad.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.280
Yeah, maybe talk
some sense into him.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.320
Yeah, good luck.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.800
We're sort of leaving them to
it. I get both sides.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.840
Sad there are sides.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.640
- Anyway...
- Yeah.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.880
Sorry about last night.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.600
I didn't realise Nathan was
hammered until it was too late.

34:49.640 --> 34:53.160
Well, if we're handing out
apologies, accept mine.

34:53.160 --> 34:57.040
I should've thought what barging
in like this would do to Cassie.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.360
No worries.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.800
How much is IVF? I want
to take care of it for you.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.000
Someone in this family has to
have a functioning relationship

35:06.040 --> 35:08.000
and given me and
Nathan and Mum and Dad,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.680
you and Cassie are about it.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.160
No pressure.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.480
I mean, it can be a gift.
It can be a loan.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.000
However you wanna do it.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.640
And I know you're gonna
hate taking my money...

35:17.640 --> 35:20.080
No, I won't because this
is what Cassie wants

35:20.120 --> 35:23.160
and I don't have
any way to give it to her.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.600
Exhibit A â€“ why Ben is the one
that wins at relationships.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.280
Thank you. Ah!

35:30.920 --> 35:33.640
Wait till I call her.
She'll be so stoked.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.640
So you'll be OK with having
them both?

35:35.640 --> 35:38.840
Sure. Things are good between
you and Rach, though?

35:38.880 --> 35:41.680
Uh...she'll tell you. They
should be there by tonight.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.400
Can't wait.
As long as you're fine.

35:44.440 --> 35:47.440
As can be expected. Bye.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.160
Bye.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.360
Not that I'm trying to say sorry
or anything...

36:11.400 --> 36:13.440
Well, you should
get drunk more often

36:13.480 --> 36:14.480
if this is how it ends.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.000
No. I really, really
shouldn't.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.760
I just called your dad.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.000
I bet he was impressed.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.920
Rachel's heading up there today.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.440
I think you should too.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.800
- I can't.
- Yes you can.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.800
I can't pull Edward out of
school.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.160
It's his first week back

36:29.200 --> 36:31.360
and there's a
bring your family zoo excursion.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.800
Well, I can take him.
I love the zoo.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.480
And Edward loves
being here with us.

36:40.960 --> 36:44.440
I really think you need the
change to process everything.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.280
You're no good
to anyone like this.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.440
My life's falling apart, Mum.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.080
I know.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.480
I think a job serving booze
is probably a bad idea.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.000
Yeah.

37:08.040 --> 37:11.040
And having to face Anna,

37:11.080 --> 37:14.160
probably not going to
do wonders for me either.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.600
Uh-uh.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.440
So Buradeena it is.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.920
Rachel's not gonna wanna

37:21.960 --> 37:23.800
spend five hours
in the car with me.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.160
Well, it'll give you plenty
of time to apologise

37:26.160 --> 37:28.280
for vomiting all over
her work colleague.

37:41.680 --> 37:47.320
Ah. Can we get this out of the
way? I am so, so sorry.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.840
- Justin's not you.
- I know!

37:50.840 --> 37:52.920
What am I?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.920
We have five hours
to discuss that.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.760
What am I? What's Mum?

37:57.800 --> 37:59.880
Won't be short of conversation.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.200
You said it, baby.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.560
Your brother-in-law
is a complete and utter Wally.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.640
Rachel's giving us
the money for more IVF.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.120
As many rounds as it takes.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.600
There's no avoiding
the big conversation now.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.080
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.640
You know what
happened with Justin?

38:49.640 --> 38:51.160
I got jealous.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.480
Seriously, he was the me
I used to be.

38:54.520 --> 38:59.120
- Where did that guy go?
- Where did I go?

38:59.160 --> 39:01.640
Suburban girl who thought
a corner office in Sydney

39:01.680 --> 39:03.280
was the summit of achievement.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.520
How did I let him slip away?

39:10.680 --> 39:13.560
Nathan, you know what I think
about when I lie awake at night?

39:13.600 --> 39:15.120
Mm. Not sure I want to know.

39:18.560 --> 39:22.280
When I'm stressing about, 'How
the hell am I gonna do this?'

39:22.320 --> 39:24.680
and 'Have I made
a huge mistake?'

39:24.760 --> 39:27.320
I think, 'Look at Nathan.'

39:27.360 --> 39:30.480
'Look at what an awesome job
he's done with Edward.'

39:30.520 --> 39:32.840
And you've mostly
done that by yourself.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.440
He's a great kid.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.520
I know a lot of things haven't
turned out the way you wanted.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.040
But there's Edward.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.800
I just hope I can do as good
a job as you're doing.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.520
That feels like way more praise
than I deserve.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.160
I know everything else
is crappy and stressful.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.440
Aren't we a pair of screw-ups?

40:01.480 --> 40:03.480
Just a couple of dags.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.120
<i>I could hear</i>
<i>my boss on my shoulder.</i>

40:06.160 --> 40:07.640
<i>'See? Transparency pays.</i>

40:09.160 --> 40:10.840
<i>'Now you're on the way</i>

40:10.880 --> 40:14.560
<i>'to the new narrative</i>
<i>that everyone can own.'</i>

40:25.560 --> 40:27.480
Dad!

40:27.520 --> 40:29.000
Hey!

40:33.640 --> 40:35.080
Hey, Dad.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.760
I get why you love
it.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.160
Not your speed?

40:49.200 --> 40:52.160
I'm more Mum than you.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.880
What's gonna happen?

40:58.920 --> 41:00.640
With us?

41:00.640 --> 41:03.800
Search me.

41:09.080 --> 41:14.280
Your mum's ruled the roost.
Always has.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.320
Not that I minded.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.080
I've been happy
going along with it.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.280
This time, I'm not.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.400
This...is me.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.000
I can't move for some
pie-in-the-sky

41:33.040 --> 41:35.960
moment of self-realisation
she may never find.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.040
If she doesn't,
we'd both be lost.

41:40.080 --> 41:47.040
And end up a bitter old couple
sniping our way to the grave.

41:47.080 --> 41:50.160
- Dad...
- It could happen.

41:52.840 --> 41:57.960
I'd rather let her go
and keep some form of love

41:58.000 --> 42:00.960
than trip along with her
and risk losing it.

42:03.960 --> 42:06.040
I've never heard you talk like
that.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.160
A fella doesn't wear his heart
on his sleeve.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.600
I guess a fella doesn't.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.320
I love a fella.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.320
A fella loves you.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.920
And if you can't solve it?

42:34.800 --> 42:37.000
Divorce.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.080
It's possible.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.080
I hope I never have to
say that to your mum.

42:49.960 --> 42:53.680
<i>This is so not</i>
<i>the new narrative I had in mind.</i>

42:53.760 --> 42:55.920
<i>As to how to fix it?</i>

42:55.960 --> 42:58.320
<i>I'm at a total loss.</i>
