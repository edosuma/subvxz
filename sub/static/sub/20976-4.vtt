WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:08.367
>> The implants
were not dropping.

00:08.367 --> 00:11.600
>> Sarah went in to have
her breasts made smaller,

00:11.600 --> 00:14.200
and the plastic surgeon
gave her implants.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.567
You bought a ticket
to the complication lottery,

00:16.567 --> 00:20.700
and you won the mega prize.
You have a silicone granuloma,

00:20.700 --> 00:24.200
which is a foreign body response
to ruptured silicone.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.300
>> Definitely a scary thing
and something

00:27.300 --> 00:30.734
that I did not think about.
>> I have had three

00:30.734 --> 00:33.300
rhinoplasties since we've met.
>> We just saw you less

00:33.300 --> 00:36.300
than a year ago.
Three revision surgeries

00:36.300 --> 00:39.000
in one year?
That's crazy.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.600
>> The chance you're gonna lose
your entire nasal tip

00:43.600 --> 00:49.100
is extraordinarily high.
Do not do anything.

00:49.100 --> 00:54.533
>> ♪ I want to be sexy ♪
♪ I want to be hot ♪

00:54.533 --> 01:02.000
♪ Fix me, make me beautiful ♪
♪ I want to be perfect ♪

01:02.000 --> 01:05.233
>> I'm Rodrigo Alvarez.
I'm 32 years old.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.633
I live in London,
as well as Spain.

01:07.633 --> 01:09.734
You might remember me
from last year.

01:09.734 --> 01:11.767
>> For me to do
your nose properly,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.767
I would have to take
a piece of rib,

01:13.767 --> 01:16.633
a big scar right on the chest.
>> Scarring my eight pack.

01:16.633 --> 01:19.000
>> Well, a little bit higher.
>> Never.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.533
No, no, no, you don't touch it.
I paid a lot of money for this.

01:22.533 --> 01:25.767
As you can probably tell,
I have changed a little bit.

01:25.767 --> 01:29.500
Well, slightly upgraded.
I have had my nose done

01:29.500 --> 01:33.100
three times,
did a brow lift, an eye lift,

01:33.100 --> 01:36.367
my jaw reconstructed again,
silicone chin implants,

01:36.367 --> 01:40.000
my ears pinned back,
my chest silicone implants

01:40.000 --> 01:43.266
replaced.
I have had 42 plastic surgeries,

01:43.266 --> 01:47.166
and I have spent 305,000
English pounds,

01:47.166 --> 01:51.133
the equivalent of $450,000.

01:56.667 --> 02:00.166
I got a visa, jumped on a plane
with my two girlfriends,

02:00.166 --> 02:02.700
and then we went
to Tehran, Iran.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.400
Seven days after surgery,
when the doctor removed the cast

02:06.400 --> 02:08.533
from my nose,
I looked at myself

02:08.533 --> 02:11.133
in the mirror,
and then I started crying,

02:11.133 --> 02:14.433
crying of happiness
because that was the man

02:14.433 --> 02:18.567
that I was meant to be.
I was in a very good place,

02:18.567 --> 02:24.166
but unfortunately
that didn't last for too long.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.600
First I started to see a dent
on the left side.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.667
My nose started to get tighter
and harder to breathe.

02:31.667 --> 02:35.567
I live a very busy lifestyle,
still living the life,

02:35.567 --> 02:38.533
being the party boy.
Nothing has changed,

02:38.533 --> 02:42.433
apart of the fact
that now I am actually botched,

02:42.433 --> 02:46.433
so why not coming to Los Angeles
and see Dr. Nassif again?

02:46.433 --> 02:50.567
That will be my seventh
and last rhinoplasty,

02:50.567 --> 02:52.467
and that will be it.

02:54.433 --> 02:57.100
>> My name is Sarah.
I'm 33, and my breasts look

02:57.100 --> 03:01.367
like two fallen soufflés.
Growing up in Tyler, Texas,

03:01.367 --> 03:04.500
I was literally born and raised,
you know, playing in the dirt

03:04.500 --> 03:07.433
and the woods
and just real tomboyish.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.633
In junior high,
I started developing breasts.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.567
They were really heavy,
really annoying,

03:12.567 --> 03:16.333
and I hated bras.
My passion has always been

03:16.333 --> 03:19.166
for cooking,
and so I opened up

03:19.166 --> 03:22.100
a restaurant: Bud Jones Bayou.
I would be on my feet

03:22.100 --> 03:25.767
12, 13, 14 hours a day.
Because of my breasts,

03:25.767 --> 03:28.367
my back would usually kill me
by the end of the day,

03:28.367 --> 03:32.100
so I found a doctor in Tyler.
I didn't want them to be as big.

03:32.100 --> 03:35.500
I just wanted them to be perky.
He gave me one option

03:35.500 --> 03:38.467
that he really thought
would be a good option for me,

03:38.467 --> 03:41.633
which was a Benelli Lift.
No scars

03:41.633 --> 03:44.533
from what you understand,
just a scar around your areola

03:44.533 --> 03:47.133
so it sounded great.
I knew nothing

03:47.133 --> 03:50.066
about breast surgery
or any kind of surgery,

03:50.066 --> 03:52.600
so I really kind of put my trust
in the doctor

03:52.600 --> 03:56.467
and went with what he had said.
Whenever I got home,

03:56.467 --> 03:58.734
I did notice that my breasts
were even bigger

03:58.734 --> 04:02.133
than what they were before
I even went into surgery.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.200
None of my breast tissue
was ever removed.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.500
I still have all of my natural
breast tissue,

04:06.500 --> 04:09.100
and then on top
of my breast tissue,

04:09.100 --> 04:12.533
I have these huge
saline implants.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.400
It was worse
than what I started with.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.700
The implants were not dropping.
It was almost like

04:17.700 --> 04:21.166
they were getting higher,
so I went to another doctor

04:21.166 --> 04:22.433
in Tyler.
That doctor

04:22.433 --> 04:25.633
didn't even want to touch it.
He said there was way too much

04:25.633 --> 04:30.100
risk involved, and I went
to ten different doctors.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.300
All the doctors have all told me
that there's nothing

04:32.300 --> 04:34.767
they can do for me,
and that's when I knew

04:34.767 --> 04:38.633
there was a major problem.
>> Hey, babe.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.567
>> You want to help me?
>> I guess.

04:40.567 --> 04:43.400
>> I am testing out a recipe
for the restaurant.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.667
>> What is it?
>> Seafood pot pie.

04:45.667 --> 04:49.133
My neck is killing me.
Because the implant

04:49.133 --> 04:52.266
on my left side
was going into my arm,

04:52.266 --> 04:54.700
it constantly
has a shooting pain,

04:54.700 --> 04:57.300
and on top of it,
it likes to go numb.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.000
Come grab this pan.
No, this one that's fixing

04:59.000 --> 05:00.734
to fall out of my hand.
>> Oh. I got it, I got it.

05:00.734 --> 05:05.000
>> Thank you.
And so I drop everything.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.533
I've been thinking about
going to see

05:06.533 --> 05:09.300
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif.
>> Why does it have to be

05:09.300 --> 05:12.033
all the way in California?
I understand that we've talked

05:12.033 --> 05:14.200
to a lot of doctors in Texas,
but we haven't talked

05:14.200 --> 05:16.533
to every single one of them.
>> Just see what they say

05:16.533 --> 05:18.133
and then we'll just kind of
go from there.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.533
>> If that's what
you want to do.

05:19.533 --> 05:22.433
You know, you're the boss.
>> After seeing all the doctors

05:22.433 --> 05:24.533
and everyone telling me
that it's too risky,

05:24.533 --> 05:26.667
that's why I want
to go see Dr. Dubrow.

05:26.667 --> 05:31.467
I know that he likes taking on
cases that are the risky cases,

05:31.467 --> 05:34.066
and I think that he could
probably be able to help me.

05:34.066 --> 05:35.333
How do you think it'll do
at the restaurant?

05:35.333 --> 05:39.233
>> I'll eat it.
>> Hey, you got your own pie.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.166
This one's mine.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.767
>> I knew I wanted
to become a doctor

05:45.767 --> 05:48.433
at the age of about eight.
>> I actually thought

05:48.433 --> 05:50.433
I might want to be
a dentist initially.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.333
>> Really?
>> Yeah. So what happened was,

05:52.333 --> 05:54.734
I volunteered
in a dentist's office,

05:54.734 --> 05:58.600
and I was bored out of my mind.
One of the nurses said,

05:58.600 --> 06:00.467
"You should go over
to the emergency room

06:00.467 --> 06:02.433
and volunteer there."
I went over

06:02.433 --> 06:03.700
to the emergency room,
and instantly,

06:03.700 --> 06:06.333
I loved the smell.
I loved the vibe.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.066
You meet a patient,
you make a decision,

06:09.066 --> 06:11.200
and then you act
on that decision.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.233
>> Do I think
Terry would be a good dentist?

06:13.233 --> 06:16.233
Absolutely, because
while Terry's at home,

06:16.233 --> 06:21.100
he probably spends a lot more
time flossing his teeth rather

06:21.100 --> 06:23.500
than playing with breasts.
>> Our next patient,

06:23.500 --> 06:28.233
whose name is Sarah,
had some bad decisions made.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.767
She had breast
augmentation surgery

06:29.767 --> 06:32.600
with some kind of a lift.
>> Oh.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.767
Is that just stretched
>> No, these are very

06:34.767 --> 06:36.667
significantly
scarred-up breasts.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.467
Look where the implants
are located.

06:38.467 --> 06:40.066
Yeah, this is
a really difficult case.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.233
Why don't we bring her in
and see what she wants

06:42.233 --> 06:45.000
and figure out
if it's worth the risk.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.400
>> Will you please
send in Sarah?

06:48.400 --> 06:51.066
Sarah, hi. Dr. Nassif.
>> Sarah Willis.

06:51.066 --> 06:52.333
Nice to meet you.
>> Terry Dubrow.

06:52.333 --> 06:53.633
Pleasure to meet you.
>> Nice to meet you.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.767
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif
are absolutely

06:55.767 --> 06:58.400
my last hope on this.
Everyone else has told me

06:58.400 --> 07:00.700
they cannot
or will not touch it,

07:00.700 --> 07:05.233
so they kind of are all I have.
>> How long have you guys

07:05.233 --> 07:06.533
been together?
>> We've been together

07:06.533 --> 07:08.667
going on our third year.
>> Third year, okay.

07:08.667 --> 07:12.133
>> What were you, like, 18, 19?
>> Really?

07:12.133 --> 07:17.300
>> Chad is 34, and I am 33,
so he is actually older.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.500
He just can't grow facial hair.
>> We want to hear

07:19.500 --> 07:22.233
what's going on with you.
>> Well, a few years ago, I went

07:22.233 --> 07:25.133
and got plastic surgery done
for my breasts.

07:25.133 --> 07:27.500
The doctor that I went to,
I looked him up.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.100
I did everything
I was supposed to.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.000
You know, he told me that
we needed to do a Benelli Lift,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.633
and he really wanted to do
implants with it.

07:34.633 --> 07:38.133
>> Sarah went in to have
her breasts made smaller,

07:38.133 --> 07:40.600
and the plastic surgeon
gave her implants.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.433
It really speaks to the fact
that breast implant surgery

07:44.433 --> 07:46.533
is a business
to a lot of doctors,

07:46.533 --> 07:49.433
and a breast augmentation
is a lot easier to do

07:49.433 --> 07:52.467
than a breast reduction.
>> He said that the next surgery

07:52.467 --> 07:54.533
to fix this
we could do in his office.

07:54.533 --> 07:58.667
He told me to wait a year.
I go back, and he acted like

07:58.667 --> 08:01.300
he just didn't know
what I was talking about.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.033
It was a slap in the face.
>> I feel for Sarah because she

08:04.033 --> 08:06.533
followed the doctor's orders,
she waited a complete year,

08:06.533 --> 08:08.000
and then when she saw
the doctor,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.433
the doctor blew her off,
basically says,

08:09.433 --> 08:11.400
"I can't help you."
We would never do that

08:11.400 --> 08:13.033
to a patient,
and for some reason,

08:13.033 --> 08:15.333
if we can't operate on them,
at least we're gonna be nice

08:15.333 --> 08:17.567
and explain why.
>> What are your goals?

08:17.567 --> 08:21.300
>> My left arm, I lose...
like, it goes numb

08:21.300 --> 08:24.467
and falls asleep on me,
and then I get a sharp pain

08:24.467 --> 08:26.367
that goes through my arm.
>> Right.

08:26.367 --> 08:30.300
You have the most severe form
of capsular contracture.

08:30.300 --> 08:33.100
This is a scary case.
I'm gonna just be

08:33.100 --> 08:35.433
right up front with you.
>> My immediate thought is,

08:35.433 --> 08:38.500
"There's nothing he can do."
I think that we're on the same

08:38.500 --> 08:40.467
dog-and-pony show
we've been on

08:40.467 --> 08:42.033
with the rest of the doctors.
>> Well, let's go

08:42.033 --> 08:44.200
in the exam room
and do a careful exam

08:44.200 --> 08:46.133
and see what's going on.

08:48.433 --> 08:52.100
You have droopiness.
You have severe scarring.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.700
>> If the doctors decide
that they can't fix my breasts,

08:54.700 --> 08:58.033
I would probably just cry.
>> They were buttock implants,

08:58.033 --> 08:59.600
right?
>> I don't know

08:59.600 --> 09:08.400
what is in there at all.
>> This one almost has a mass.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.667
>> ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪
>> I want to see

09:12.667 --> 09:16.734
your breast situation.
So the first thing I notice

09:16.734 --> 09:18.400
when you look
at your breast situation is,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.333
your breast implants
are up here, okay.

09:21.333 --> 09:24.100
There's nothing
but scar tissue holding it up.

09:24.100 --> 09:27.133
That makes the inside
just filled with scar,

09:27.133 --> 09:29.667
with very poor blood supply.
>> If the doctors decide

09:29.667 --> 09:32.767
that they can't fix my breasts,
I would probably just cry

09:32.767 --> 09:36.233
'cause there's no other doctors.
Everyone else has told me

09:36.233 --> 09:38.500
they cannot
or will not touch it,

09:38.500 --> 09:42.433
so it would break my heart.
>> You have droopiness.

09:42.433 --> 09:46.100
You have severe scarring.
You still have these dilated,

09:46.100 --> 09:48.500
enlarged areolas.
Sarah's breasts

09:48.500 --> 09:52.633
are completely disfigured.
She's both botched in the inside

09:52.633 --> 09:56.233
and the outside, and this is
a very difficult problem.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.633
You bought a ticket
to the complication lottery,

09:58.633 --> 10:03.133
and you won the mega prize.
This is hard surgery,

10:03.133 --> 10:06.633
as hard as it comes.
Having said that,

10:06.633 --> 10:09.266
this is what we live for.
>> Knowing that Dr. Dubrow

10:09.266 --> 10:12.133
is gonna fix me
makes me feel so great.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.433
Now I've won the lottery.
This is winning

10:14.433 --> 10:17.533
the good lottery,
not his lottery.

10:17.533 --> 10:21.367
>> I like to make lifts
high and tight, okay.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.533
You're not gonna be tight.
The tighter you are,

10:23.533 --> 10:26.066
the greater the chance
it's gonna fall apart,

10:26.066 --> 10:29.667
and so it'll be nice
but not too tight.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.433
All right, you guys.
>> Thank you so much.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.533
>> My pleasure.
>> I am really hoping

10:34.533 --> 10:38.266
that after the surgery,
I'll be able to cook

10:38.266 --> 10:40.700
without dropping everything
and not having

10:40.700 --> 10:44.533
my back killing me all the time.
I'm just super excited

10:44.533 --> 10:47.533
to have that little piece
that you take for granted

10:47.533 --> 10:51.033
so much back in my life.
Yay.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.767
I was so worried.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.300
>> My name is Elena.
I'm 42 years old,

10:57.300 --> 11:00.700
and I live in New Jersey.
My implants are a big pain

11:00.700 --> 11:04.734
in my ass, literally.
I'm a Puerto Rican girl,

11:04.734 --> 11:07.567
and in the Hispanic culture,
having a big booty

11:07.567 --> 11:11.300
is a basic thing.
It's just like rice and beans.

11:11.300 --> 11:14.066
It's just the way it is,
but I never developed.

11:14.066 --> 11:17.233
I didn't have the butt.
I didn't really have anything.

11:17.233 --> 11:20.333
At the age of 32,
I joined the United States Army.

11:20.333 --> 11:23.700
I met a battle buddy,
a female soldier,

11:23.700 --> 11:28.066
who had a fantastic ass,
absolutely fantastic,

11:28.066 --> 11:30.433
and she told me that she had
butt implants.

11:30.433 --> 11:33.333
After I finished my contract
with the military,

11:33.333 --> 11:35.633
I went back home
and became an EMT.

11:35.633 --> 11:39.033
About a year and a half
into working for EMS, I decided

11:39.033 --> 11:42.166
that it was time for me to go
and get my butt implants.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.700
This doctor was located
in Mexico, and there were

11:44.700 --> 11:48.467
absolutely no red flags.
This place was immaculate.

11:48.467 --> 11:52.600
It was absolutely beautiful--
marble floor, chandeliers.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.400
After my surgery,
my ass was absolutely fantastic,

11:56.400 --> 11:59.767
but at month seven,
I started noticing a change

11:59.767 --> 12:04.600
in my butt implants.
They dropped immensely,

12:04.600 --> 12:07.233
so I contacted the doctor,
and there was really

12:07.233 --> 12:08.767
nothing I could do,
other than going back

12:08.767 --> 12:12.333
and having him take them out,
but I didn't really want

12:12.333 --> 12:17.133
to go back to him.
I realized that he really

12:17.133 --> 12:19.767
just did not have the surgical
expertise to fix it,

12:19.767 --> 12:22.600
so I decided to leave them in,
and I thought, "How much further

12:22.600 --> 12:25.333
can they stretch?"
A lot.

12:25.333 --> 12:28.400
It is just an absolute mess,
and having to sit

12:28.400 --> 12:32.266
on these implants
for two years

12:32.266 --> 12:35.133
driving an ambulance
for 12 hours a day,

12:35.133 --> 12:38.000
I was really suffering.
I had to leave my job,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.367
which is why I ended up
becoming a dominatrix.

12:41.367 --> 12:43.100
One of the things
that I appreciate most

12:43.100 --> 12:46.367
about being a dominatrix
is that I don't have to conform

12:46.367 --> 12:48.767
to regular, everyday society
in wearing certain

12:48.767 --> 12:51.767
types of clothing to go to work.
Emotionally, it made me

12:51.767 --> 12:55.400
feel comfortable
that I was acceptable and wanted

12:55.400 --> 12:58.233
just for the way that I looked.
Thank goodness I don't have eyes

12:58.233 --> 13:01.133
in the back of my head
because I am not happy at all.

13:01.133 --> 13:12.400
I'm a big girl,
and I need to have a booty.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.734
>> How many pills
are you gonna take?

13:13.734 --> 13:16.433
>> Just a little bit
of pills here.

13:16.433 --> 13:19.333
>> One
>> That actually increases

13:19.333 --> 13:22.266
blood supply to the brain
and the heart,

13:22.266 --> 13:26.166
but it also increases
blood flow to the penis.

13:26.166 --> 13:30.033
It probably adds 10%
of firmness.

13:30.033 --> 13:32.533
>> So you're walking around
with 10% of a woody

13:32.533 --> 13:34.433
all day long?
>> No.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.667
>> Paul is just
inches away from me,

13:36.667 --> 13:39.567
and knowing that he has
a little firmness down there,

13:39.567 --> 13:42.567
that's something I really
could live without knowing.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.000
So our next patient
is named Elena,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.567
and she had buttock
augmentation surgery

13:47.567 --> 13:50.567
that hasn't gone exactly the way
she wanted it to.

13:50.567 --> 13:52.600
She had it done
in a foreign country,

13:52.600 --> 13:55.066
and let me show you
what's going on with it.

13:55.066 --> 13:59.033
You can see that she's got
significant displacement

13:59.033 --> 14:00.567
of the implant
and what looks like

14:00.567 --> 14:03.066
an encapsulation almost.
We just need to being her in

14:03.066 --> 14:05.333
and see what she looks like.
>> Will you please

14:05.333 --> 14:08.166
send in Elena?
>> There she is.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.700
>> Hi. How are you?
>> Dr. Nassif.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.200
Nice to meet you, Elena.
>> I'm Elena. How are you?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.734
>> Hi, Elena. Terry Dubrow.
>> Hi, nice to meet you.

14:13.734 --> 14:15.233
>> Please have a seat.
>> Thank you.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.734
I do know that there's something
very wrong.

14:17.734 --> 14:20.033
I'm really hoping
that the doctors

14:20.033 --> 14:22.100
tell me that they can
take out these implants

14:22.100 --> 14:25.333
and come up with some kind
of way where I can still have

14:25.333 --> 14:28.166
the kind of ass that I want.
That would be fantastic.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.567
>> We know that you had
your surgery done

14:30.567 --> 14:32.400
outside of the United States.
Correct?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.734
>> Yes, in Tijuana.
>> In Tijuana, okay.

14:34.734 --> 14:37.767
Why Tijuana?
What was the story with that?

14:37.767 --> 14:40.100
>> I was in the military,
and I had a battle buddy

14:40.100 --> 14:43.200
that had butt implants,
and she looked

14:43.200 --> 14:45.100
absolutely fantastic.
>> And she had it done

14:45.100 --> 14:46.467
in Tijuana.
>> She had it done in Tijuana

14:46.467 --> 14:49.200
by this particular doctor
and so did her friend.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.467
>> In what branch
of the military?

14:50.467 --> 14:52.200
>> The army.
>> What were you doing?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.600
>> I was a weapons mechanic,
45 Bravo.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.233
>> You take them apart,
clean them,

14:56.233 --> 14:57.600
and put them back together?
>> Take them apart,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.500
clean them, replace worn parts.
>> How did you get

15:00.500 --> 15:03.200
into that field of the military?
>> I wanted to do something

15:03.200 --> 15:06.100
that kind of meant something,
especially after 9/11.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.633
>> Okay, that's very cool.
>> So I joined the military.

15:08.633 --> 15:10.400
>> I have a lot of respect
for Elena.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.667
She joined the army after 9/11,
and that takes a lot of guts.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.500
>> So now I'm a dominatrix.
>> Oh.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.133
>> A dominatrix, okay.
>> I'm lucky in the fact that

15:19.133 --> 15:22.667
I can kind of manipulate my body
in some of the costumes I wear.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.233
If I had to wear
regular clothes,

15:24.233 --> 15:26.500
it would really just be
very annoying.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.567
>> Not only is she
a weapons mechanic,

15:28.567 --> 15:32.100
but she's also a dominatrix.
She is a tough cookie.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.400
>> Everything was great
when I first got them.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.567
>> They were buttock implants,
right?

15:36.567 --> 15:39.000
They weren't breast implants?
>> That's a very good question.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.667
These were jelly implants.
>> So when you say jelly,

15:41.667 --> 15:45.133
you mean breast implants.
Most buttock implants

15:45.133 --> 15:48.000
are supposed to be
made out of a solid material.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.233
This is not my first
buttock rodeo,

15:50.233 --> 15:53.400
and I wouldn't be surprised
if she in fact does

15:53.400 --> 15:56.734
have gel breast implants.
>> For me to even go anywhere

15:56.734 --> 15:59.400
or, like, go to the gym or do
anything that requires, like,

15:59.400 --> 16:01.467
physical activity,
I am so petrified.

16:01.467 --> 16:04.600
Like, in my mind,
I just imagine these implants

16:04.600 --> 16:08.533
pulling on my skin unless I wear
some kind of crazy shape

16:08.533 --> 16:10.000
where it'll frigging
hold them into place.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.266
>> Oh, really?
>> Yeah.

16:11.266 --> 16:13.400
>> So, Elena,
you have an interesting,

16:13.400 --> 16:17.166
potentially complicated problem.
Let's go in there, take a look,

16:17.166 --> 16:20.734
and figure out what you might
consider doing. Okay?

16:20.734 --> 16:23.667
>> Okay.
>> All right, let's go.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.166
>> I have no idea
what is in my ass at this point.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.433
I don't know if it's a breast
implant, a butt implant.

16:28.433 --> 16:30.567
I don't know
what is in there at all.

16:30.567 --> 16:35.133
>> Okay, so they're down here.
You have incisions,

16:35.133 --> 16:37.633
one on each side
of your buttock cheek.

16:37.633 --> 16:41.066
That's really sort of a very
unconventional way of doing it,

16:41.066 --> 16:44.567
and this one almost has a mass.
It's almost like you have

16:44.567 --> 16:47.734
a silicone granuloma,
which is a foreign body response

16:47.734 --> 16:51.700
to ruptured silicone.
>> Definitely a scary thing

16:51.700 --> 16:54.367
and something
that I did not think about.

16:54.367 --> 16:59.100
>> We have problems galore here.
>> I just want to be

16:59.100 --> 17:03.066
anatomically correct at least.
>> Okay. We're gonna help you.

17:03.066 --> 17:07.300
We are gonna stand tall for you.
You stood tall for us.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.200
You served your country.
It's time

17:09.200 --> 17:12.734
your country served you,
and if that's in the form of us,

17:12.734 --> 17:14.300
I'm all in.
>> Thank you.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.567
>> You know what I mean?
>> Yes.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.767
>> This is someone
who has served her country

17:17.767 --> 17:23.066
to protect us and keep us safe.
I think I can take a little risk

17:23.066 --> 17:27.467
for someone like Elena who's
taken a lot of risk for us.

17:27.467 --> 17:28.767
>> Thank you so much.
>> It was nice meeting you.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.734
>> Thank you so much.
>> I'm gonna take him out

17:30.734 --> 17:33.600
and whip him a little bit.
>> You should. Thank you.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.533
>> Sure.

17:37.367 --> 17:41.233
>> You look so different.
>> I had a brow lift,

17:41.233 --> 17:43.600
an eye lift.
Then I had

17:43.600 --> 17:47.333
my chest implants replaced.
As you can see, it look bigger.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.500
>> I'm definitely shocked
to see the way

17:49.500 --> 17:52.734
that Rodrigo looks now.
>> This is Sarah

17:52.734 --> 17:54.767
without implants.
>> As long as you think

17:54.767 --> 17:56.533
that that's a good size.
>> That's why

17:56.533 --> 17:58.066
I brought you in here.
>> It's a lot of pressure,

17:58.066 --> 18:01.133
especially since I've never made
anybody else's decision

18:01.133 --> 18:03.066
for them.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.467
>> ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

18:19.266 --> 18:21.367
>> It feels great
to be back in L.A.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.233
I'm very excited to see
my friend Karly.

18:24.233 --> 18:27.633
She's gonna be very surprised
to see the new me.

18:27.633 --> 18:29.233
Hello.
>> Good morning.

18:29.233 --> 18:33.000
>> I had a lot of work done,
and I think that's

18:33.000 --> 18:36.100
she's gonna be a little bit
like, "Wow, you changed."

18:36.100 --> 18:39.767
Hello, hello, hello.
>> Hello, Rodrigo.

18:39.767 --> 18:45.133
Oh, I've missed you.
How are you? Look at you.

18:45.133 --> 18:48.166
>> It's wonderful to see you.
Look at you. Yeah.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.166
>> Wow, you look--
>> Look at your hair.

18:50.166 --> 18:53.000
It's beautiful.
>> You look so different.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.533
I'm definitely shocked to see
the way that Rodrigo looks now.

18:56.533 --> 19:00.166
Hi whole face overall
just looks like he's had

19:00.166 --> 19:04.000
some more procedures done.
>> As you can tell,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.266
I have had more work done.
>> Well, you look amazing.

19:08.266 --> 19:12.133
>> I had a brow lift,
an eye lift.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.333
Then I had my chest implants
replaced.

19:14.333 --> 19:19.533
As you can see, it look bigger.
From 140 milliliters,

19:19.533 --> 19:24.066
now I have 240.
>> Ooh, sexy.

19:24.066 --> 19:26.367
>> Yeah, I love them.
>> I didn't want to make you

19:26.367 --> 19:28.033
uncomfortable,
but I have to ask.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.567
Like, what happened
with your nose?

19:30.567 --> 19:46.700
>> I got a bacterial infection.
>> Oh, my goodness.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.734
So I'm hoping that Dr. Nassif
will be able to say, "Yes,

19:49.734 --> 19:53.300
I'm able to fix your nose,"
and hopefully by next week,

19:53.300 --> 19:55.567
I'm gonna be able
to breathe again.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.734
>> And that'll be it.
>> And that will be it.

19:57.734 --> 20:00.500
>> Beautiful.
>> Thanks to plastic surgery.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.433
>> Thanks to plastic surgery.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.333
>> I'm checking in for surgery
with Dr. Dubrow.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.767
>> Okay, can I just
have you sign in?

20:12.767 --> 20:15.467
>> I'm so nervous I can't write.
What is wrong with me?

20:15.467 --> 20:18.400
My anxiety is at about
a ten right now.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.533
Now I've worked myself up, like,
to where I'm just more--like,

20:21.533 --> 20:23.600
I want them to be right,
and I want them to be perfect.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.767
I'm so excited
to be able to move on with it.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.633
It's just kind of been
a weight on my shoulders.

20:27.633 --> 20:30.266
I mean, literally I don't
remember what it's like

20:30.266 --> 20:33.066
to have breasts
that do not hurt constantly,

20:33.066 --> 20:34.533
and I don't even remember
what it's like to have

20:34.533 --> 20:37.233
normal-looking breasts.
>> So one of the options

20:37.233 --> 20:40.367
is to take these out,
say good-bye to breast implants

20:40.367 --> 20:44.367
for a while, if not forever,
and use your own breast tissue

20:44.367 --> 20:47.467
and try to give you
the best breast shape possible.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.500
>> Mm-hmm.
>> And if I like it,

20:49.500 --> 20:52.500
I'll leave the implants out.
If I don't like it,

20:52.500 --> 20:55.233
I'll put a pair in.
>> I trust your opinion.

20:55.233 --> 20:56.500
I mean, I don't--
>> You want to leave

20:56.500 --> 20:58.567
it up to me?
>> Whatever you think

20:58.567 --> 21:01.000
looks good.
>> Today with Sarah's surgery,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.533
there are two options,
and Sarah wants me

21:03.533 --> 21:06.166
to pick the best option.
Sarah's been through so much,

21:06.166 --> 21:08.500
and if I can save her
from having more breast implant

21:08.500 --> 21:11.433
surgery in the future,
that would be ideal.

21:11.433 --> 21:14.667
However, this is one of those
cases that I have no idea

21:14.667 --> 21:16.367
what I'm gonna do
till I get in there

21:16.367 --> 21:19.266
and I start the operation.
Sarah's surgery today

21:19.266 --> 21:22.100
is one of uncertainty.
We'll begin by making incisions

21:22.100 --> 21:25.000
below her areolas
and removing her old implants.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I will then do a lift and use
her natural breast tissue

21:28.000 --> 21:29.700
to hopefully give her
perky breasts which

21:29.700 --> 21:33.266
no longer cause her pain.
My goal is to do this naturally,

21:33.266 --> 21:36.467
without implants,
to avoid future complications.

21:36.467 --> 21:38.467
Okay, so the first thing
we're gonna do

21:38.467 --> 21:41.133
is make an incision
underneath the areola

21:41.133 --> 21:43.600
and see what the pocket
looks like.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.567
You know, it's funny.
There's not that much

21:45.567 --> 21:47.166
scar tissue.
It's almost like it was

21:47.166 --> 21:49.667
just done poorly.
I think what happened was,

21:49.667 --> 21:52.700
the surgeon
made that classic mistake

21:52.700 --> 21:56.133
where you put the implants
in first,

21:56.133 --> 22:00.000
and then you lift around it,
rather than do a lift first,

22:00.000 --> 22:03.600
and based on how tight
the lift is, you do implants.

22:03.600 --> 22:08.166
Big mistake.
You flunked plastic surgery 101.

22:08.166 --> 22:11.033
First of all, how many CCs
does she have in here?

22:11.033 --> 22:14.300
These are 350s, right?
They're not even very big.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.300
>> Mm-mm.
>> I mean, does she really

22:16.300 --> 22:18.500
need implants?
Look at all this breast tissue

22:18.500 --> 22:20.567
she has.
>> Yeah, she has tons.

22:20.567 --> 22:23.300
>> Sarah has so much
breast tissue.

22:23.300 --> 22:27.100
There really is no good reason
to take on the risk

22:27.100 --> 22:29.567
of breast implants.
This is no implant

22:29.567 --> 22:31.500
and just a lift.
It's nice, isn't it?

22:31.500 --> 22:35.600
>> Yeah.
>> I should not have allowed her

22:35.600 --> 22:38.066
to allow me
to make the decision.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.467
Gosh.
You know what we should do?

22:40.467 --> 22:42.100
I think we should
bring her fiancée in.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.066
Let's get his input,
see what he thinks.

22:44.066 --> 22:46.367
While Sarah wanted me
to make the final decision

22:46.367 --> 22:49.433
as to exactly what do to,
I'm gonna bring her fiancée

22:49.433 --> 22:51.500
Chad in because
he really knows her

22:51.500 --> 22:54.734
better than I do.
Hey, Chad, how are you?

22:54.734 --> 22:57.266
>> Hey, Dubrow.
>> So what do you think

22:57.266 --> 23:00.133
of this size?
>> Looks good to me.

23:00.133 --> 23:01.533
>> Okay, let me just
tell you something.

23:01.533 --> 23:06.233
This is Sarah without implants.
>> Really?

23:06.233 --> 23:08.100
>> You know what that means,
no implants?

23:08.100 --> 23:12.200
No implant-related
complications, ever.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.600
>> As long as you think
that that's a good size.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.233
>> Well, that's why
I brought you in here.

23:16.233 --> 23:18.066
>> It's surreal,
and it's a lot of pressure,

23:18.066 --> 23:20.500
especially since I've never
made anybody else's

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
decision for them.
Now I'm making her decision

23:22.500 --> 23:26.633
for her without even being able
to have a consult with her.

23:26.633 --> 23:28.533
I hope I am making
the right decision.

23:28.533 --> 23:31.467
>> If I put implants in her,
and she rapidly encapsulates

23:31.467 --> 23:33.667
and go to this,
you're back to square one

23:33.667 --> 23:36.433
or potentially even worse.
>> Sew her up.

23:36.433 --> 23:38.000
>> What?
>> Sew her up.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.533
>> You're the man.
All right, go relax.

23:39.533 --> 23:41.500
We're gonna sew her up.
>> I don't know if I made

23:41.500 --> 23:44.133
the right decision or not.
She wanted nice, perky boobs.

23:44.133 --> 23:45.433
If she doesn't
get that out of this,

23:45.433 --> 23:50.100
now it falls on me.
That's not really that cool.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.633
>> All right, the question is,
what will Sarah say

23:52.633 --> 23:56.000
when we're done.
Will she demand implants?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.734
Only time will tell.

23:58.767 --> 24:00.667
>> Is that a pec implant?
What is that?

24:00.667 --> 24:02.367
>> I don't know
what the heck this thing is.

24:02.367 --> 24:05.633
I must think outside the box
in order to give her

24:05.633 --> 24:08.400
an acceptable result.
>> Ever since I have had

24:08.400 --> 24:10.767
three rhinoplasties
since we've met.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.700
>> We just saw you
less than a year ago.

24:12.700 --> 24:16.300
Three revision surgeries
in one year?

24:16.300 --> 24:18.233
That's crazy.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.567
>> ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

24:26.700 --> 24:28.600
>> Hi. How are you?
>> Hi, Elena.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.700
>> I need to check in
with Dr. Dubrow.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.433
>> Okay, go ahead and sign in,
and we'll get you

24:32.433 --> 24:33.700
taken right back.
>> Okay, thank you.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.266
>> You're welcome.
>> I'm really happy

24:35.266 --> 24:38.300
that my implants
will be removed today

24:38.300 --> 24:40.667
and that Dr. Dubrow
will do everything that he can

24:40.667 --> 24:43.433
to make the situation
a healthy one for me.

24:43.433 --> 24:44.700
>> Hello.
>> How are you?

24:44.700 --> 24:47.000
>> How are you?
>> Very good.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.066
>> So do me a favor,
stand up for a sec

24:51.066 --> 24:53.133
and let's go over
what's going on with your butt.

24:53.133 --> 24:55.133
Although I'm eager
to help Elena,

24:55.133 --> 24:58.433
the last thing you really want
to do is mess up on a dominatrix

24:58.433 --> 25:01.200
and have her come after you
with her whips and chains.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.333
So this tattoo situation.
>> Yes.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.600
>> You don't care
what I do with it.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.033
>> I don't care
what you do with it.

25:07.033 --> 25:08.467
>> Okay, so that's
a total non issue.

25:08.467 --> 25:09.767
>> Yeah.
No, not an issue at all.

25:09.767 --> 25:12.567
>> What we're going to do
is try to lift up her buttock

25:12.567 --> 25:16.166
to relieve her of the laxity,
but I have to do something

25:16.166 --> 25:18.200
extraordinary
to try to give her

25:18.200 --> 25:20.600
some additional projection
since I'm not using

25:20.600 --> 25:23.300
implants anymore, so this
is a challenging procedure.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.033
For Elena's surgery, we're going
to start by making incisions

25:26.033 --> 25:28.300
through her previous scars
and removing the implants

25:28.300 --> 25:30.600
from her buttock.
If there's an implant rupture,

25:30.600 --> 25:33.300
we will flush out the inside
of her pockets, eliminating

25:33.300 --> 25:36.633
any free-floating silicone.
Finally, we'll make an incision

25:36.633 --> 25:39.200
across her lower back
and perform a lift,

25:39.200 --> 25:41.500
fixing the droopiness
and giving her the projection

25:41.500 --> 25:43.600
that she wanted
in the first place.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.367
All right, so we're gonna start
by making an incision

25:45.367 --> 25:50.000
in the left buttock incision.
Oh, wow, look at this.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.467
>> Well, there it is.
>> They're just immediately

25:53.467 --> 25:56.233
below the surface.
It's pretty clear

25:56.233 --> 25:59.133
that the implants
were placed above the muscle.

25:59.133 --> 26:01.266
That's the last place
you want to see them

26:01.266 --> 26:04.400
because it will have direct
stretching effects on the skin.

26:04.400 --> 26:08.333
And here it is.
>> Is that a pec implant?

26:08.333 --> 26:09.767
What is that?
>> I don't know

26:09.767 --> 26:11.333
what the heck this thing is.
>> Squishy butt implant.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.767
>> Squishy butt implant.
Right, so that leaves her

26:13.767 --> 26:17.000
with a very flat,
non-projecting buttock.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.767
So if we do a buttock lift--
Now that I've taken

26:21.767 --> 26:24.233
the implant out,
that is not going to be

26:24.233 --> 26:28.100
an adequate result.
I must think outside the box

26:28.100 --> 26:30.133
in order to give her
an acceptable result.

26:30.133 --> 26:33.233
I wonder if I can use
this flab, this fat,

26:33.233 --> 26:37.533
and rotate it down into here
to give her some volume.

26:37.533 --> 26:39.533
Let's see if we can get
a little creative today.

26:39.533 --> 26:42.633
To rotate the fat
from her love handles

26:42.633 --> 26:46.233
and flip it into
the old pockets,

26:46.233 --> 26:50.133
this is creative, it's unusual,
but it may work.

26:50.133 --> 26:53.266
To elevate a chunk
of her own fat,

26:53.266 --> 26:56.033
keep the blood supply
to her back intact,

26:56.033 --> 26:59.233
and rotate it in
to the implant pocket,

26:59.233 --> 27:03.567
it's basically a buttock implant
using her own tissue.

27:03.567 --> 27:06.166
As long as the blood supply
to these fat flaps

27:06.166 --> 27:09.000
remain intact,
they should stay alive

27:09.000 --> 27:11.200
and give her good
buttock projection.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.266
Here's hoping this works.
Okay, this looks good.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.433
So this is a novel approach
to a difficult problem.

27:17.433 --> 27:20.033
Let's stitch this up and get her
in a recovery room, okay?

27:20.033 --> 27:21.767
>> Yeah.

27:23.133 --> 27:25.266
>> So who do we have next?
>> So we have a patient

27:25.266 --> 27:28.567
that we've seen before,
from England, across the pond.

27:28.567 --> 27:30.700
Remember Rodrigo?
>> Yes.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.400
>> He wanted me
to make his nose smaller,

27:32.400 --> 27:34.567
and I said, "Well, I can't.
I'll help with your breathing.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.300
Let's put some rib in."
And he freaked out.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.600
>> Right, right, right.
>> So apparently

27:38.600 --> 27:42.533
he's had surgery,
and I do have some photos.

27:42.533 --> 27:46.633
Oh, his nose is smaller.
>> Way smaller.

27:46.633 --> 27:51.166
>> both: Oh.
>> Rodrigo's skin,

27:51.166 --> 27:54.600
it's destroyed.
>> Guess who's back.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.166
>> Rodrigo.
>> Hello, hello, hello.

27:57.166 --> 27:59.300
>> How are you?
>> I am well.

27:59.300 --> 28:13.200
It's wonderful to see you again.
>> How are you, my man?

28:13.200 --> 28:15.767
>> What we remember is,
you wanted to have more of

28:15.767 --> 28:19.066
a styled, a little bit slimmer,
sleeker nose,

28:19.066 --> 28:21.734
and you had a problem breathing,
and I said

28:21.734 --> 28:25.166
I couldn't make it smaller
but I can fix your airway,

28:25.166 --> 28:27.367
and I needed a piece of rib,
and I remember you had

28:27.367 --> 28:30.066
some sculpted,
beautiful abs, and you said,

28:30.066 --> 28:32.066
"No, no, no scarring."
>> Ever since,

28:32.066 --> 28:35.200
I have had three rhinoplasties
since we've met.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.066
>> Wait a minute.
We just saw you

28:37.066 --> 28:40.133
less than a year ago.
Three revision surgeries

28:40.133 --> 28:42.767
in one year?
That's crazy.

28:42.767 --> 28:45.500
I can't believe
he even still has a nose.

28:45.500 --> 28:49.066
It takes one to two years
just for your nose

28:49.066 --> 28:53.233
to heal after one surgery.
>> I found out that Iran

28:53.233 --> 28:56.233
is the country number one
for rhinoplasty.

28:56.233 --> 28:59.500
The doctor, in order
to perform this surgery,

28:59.500 --> 29:02.767
he used cartilage
from a bank donor.

29:02.767 --> 29:06.200
>> Cadaver bone.
>> both: Cadaver cartilage.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.567
>> Cadaver cartilage is
sometimes used

29:08.567 --> 29:11.266
for the nose when you don't have
good cartilage

29:11.266 --> 29:13.633
from the actual individual.
The problem

29:13.633 --> 29:17.233
with cadaver cartilage
is that it's not specifically

29:17.233 --> 29:21.133
for that individual,
and the chance of it reabsorbing

29:21.133 --> 29:23.533
or being attacked
by the patient's own

29:23.533 --> 29:27.166
immune system is elevated.
>> After a month,

29:27.166 --> 29:31.400
my nose started to become
smaller and smaller and shrink.

29:31.400 --> 29:35.100
I went to see a doctor in Spain.
The doctor said,

29:35.100 --> 29:39.133
"Well, you have a bacteria."
>> Most likely,

29:39.133 --> 29:42.133
the type of bacteria
that I see that eats cartilage

29:42.133 --> 29:45.233
away in the nose would be called
MRSA, methicillin-resistant

29:45.233 --> 29:48.233
Staph aureus,
and that is most likely

29:48.233 --> 29:50.567
what you had.
MRSA can enter the bloodstream.

29:50.567 --> 29:55.000
We call it sepsis, which
is bacteria inside the blood

29:55.000 --> 29:57.400
and pretty much shut
every system down

29:57.400 --> 30:00.033
in your body and kill you.
>> The fact that you've had

30:00.033 --> 30:04.033
so much surgery in the past
that you've basically disrupted

30:04.033 --> 30:06.266
so much of the blood supply
and then put a piece

30:06.266 --> 30:09.033
of dead tissue in that,
that that caused

30:09.033 --> 30:13.533
the whole thing to die.
>> Well, let's go

30:13.533 --> 30:15.700
examine your nose.
>> Let's do that, Doctor.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.633
Thank you very much.

30:19.433 --> 30:23.066
>> If you try to insult
your skin one more time now

30:23.066 --> 30:24.600
while it's healing...
>> Yes?

30:24.600 --> 30:34.600
>> This will turn black
and then die and then fall off.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.533
>> ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

30:38.066 --> 30:42.033
>> Okay, I'm gonna do--hey,
can I have that speculum?

30:42.033 --> 30:44.734
>> Here you go.
>> There's no way

30:44.734 --> 30:47.066
that's gonna fit in his nose.
Put your head back for me,

30:47.066 --> 30:51.734
all the way.
Nope, I can't see in there,

30:51.734 --> 30:54.600
and nope, I can't see in there.
There we go.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.300
His nostrils are so small,
and after what he's gone through

30:57.300 --> 30:59.100
with the MRSA,
this is probably

30:59.100 --> 31:03.200
one of the worst results
and complications that I've seen

31:03.200 --> 31:06.033
in my entire career.
All right,

31:06.033 --> 31:07.633
so let's talk about your nose.
>> Yes.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.367
I feel like crying right now,
but I'm trying to--

31:10.367 --> 31:13.200
>> I need you to be strong.
>> I'm holding back not to cry.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.200
>> Listen, the thing is--
>> 'Cause that makes you very,

31:15.200 --> 31:17.633
extremely worried.
That's why I'm here.

31:17.633 --> 31:21.600
>> The issue is what we call
the soft tissue envelope.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.667
That's the skin.
>> Right.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.734
>> So by you having
three surgeries

31:25.734 --> 31:30.000
in a period of 12 to 15 months,
destroyed your tissue.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.066
The skin's no good.
>> My nose was perfect

31:33.066 --> 31:38.400
after this last rhinoplasty,
and my friends, they never had

31:38.400 --> 31:41.767
any problem at all,
and I was the unlucky one,

31:41.767 --> 31:45.467
so I keep asking myself now,
"Why me?"

31:45.467 --> 31:48.400
>> Your nose on the inside,
you have no airway,

31:48.400 --> 31:51.667
and it's short,
so this is all scarred together,

31:51.667 --> 31:54.600
and now, since you've just
had surgery three months ago,

31:54.600 --> 31:58.166
it's gonna scar down more.
It's in a healing phase.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.633
If you try to insult your skin
one more time now

32:01.633 --> 32:03.400
while it's healing...
>> Yes?

32:03.400 --> 32:05.700
>> There's a high possibility
that if you let one

32:05.700 --> 32:08.000
of these doctors
touch your nose now,

32:08.000 --> 32:13.500
this will turn black
and then die and then fall off.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.767
Our goal is to educate patients
and protect them.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.133
The smartest thing
that Rodrigo can do now

32:18.133 --> 32:20.166
is listen to us.
>> Wow, doctors,

32:20.166 --> 32:23.533
this is much more complicated
than what I actually thought.

32:23.533 --> 32:25.367
>> I have a little bit more
news for you.

32:25.367 --> 32:30.266
So besides using rib,
the skin here from your tip

32:30.266 --> 32:34.300
down to here is contracted,
so we have to replace the skin.

32:34.300 --> 32:38.066
The simplest way
is to take this tissue here

32:38.066 --> 32:41.333
and lift it up
and reconstruct this area,

32:41.333 --> 32:44.700
and you'll have this piece
of tissue attached to here,

32:44.700 --> 32:46.300
'cause that's where
all the blood supply is,

32:46.300 --> 32:48.266
for about six to eight weeks.

32:58.266 --> 33:03.533
>> If you have any hope
of keeping your nose--

33:03.533 --> 33:07.266
we're as serious
as a heart attack, Rodrigo.

33:07.266 --> 33:11.000
You touch your nose now,
the chance you're gonna lose

33:11.000 --> 33:16.300
your entire nasal tip
and possibly more of your nose

33:16.300 --> 33:23.300
is extraordinarily high.
So do not do anything

33:23.300 --> 33:25.500
for a year.
Nothing.

33:25.500 --> 33:30.033
Chances are that his nose
will die and fall off.

33:30.033 --> 33:32.600
If he doesn't listen to us,
it's game over.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.734
>> Listen, Rodrigo, we like you.
We want to help you,

33:35.734 --> 33:39.567
and we will help you,
but you have to wait a year.

33:39.567 --> 33:42.300
>> I will wait a year
to see you again.

33:42.300 --> 33:45.200
>> Yes.
>> And--

33:45.200 --> 33:46.734
>> No more surgery.
>> It's a little bit

33:46.734 --> 33:50.367
frustrated going back to England
knowing that I wasn't able

33:50.367 --> 33:54.233
to get a solution today,
but I just need to find a way

33:54.233 --> 33:59.100
to live with it now
until I'm ready to go

33:59.100 --> 34:03.066
through another operation
to fix the current issue.

34:03.066 --> 34:10.266
What have I done to myself,
honestly?

34:10.266 --> 34:12.100
>> Hi.
>> Good morning.

34:12.100 --> 34:14.533
>> I'm here for my day one
post-op checkup

34:14.533 --> 34:16.633
with Dr. Dubrow.
>> Go ahead and sign in.

34:16.633 --> 34:18.333
>> I'm feeling really
good today.

34:18.333 --> 34:21.500
I'm a little sore but not like
I got ran over by a truck,

34:21.500 --> 34:24.133
so it's actually--
I'm feeling pretty good.

34:24.133 --> 34:29.133
>> I didn't sleep very well
because if all this goes down,

34:29.133 --> 34:32.200
and you don't like it,
I'm to blame.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.467
>> No, you're not.
>> I'm very, very, very nervous.

34:35.467 --> 34:37.467
I'm hoping I made
the right decision.

34:37.467 --> 34:39.066
>> Hi, Sarah.
I'm gonna take you back.

34:39.066 --> 34:41.100
>> All right.
>> If I didn't make

34:41.100 --> 34:43.266
the right decision,
the only thing I can think of is

34:43.266 --> 34:46.433
that I need to build
a bigger doghouse.

34:46.433 --> 34:48.533
>> Did you guys talk about
what we did?

34:48.533 --> 34:51.633
Because at the end of the day,
it was such an important

34:51.633 --> 34:54.367
decision, and who knows you
better than your fiancée,

34:54.367 --> 34:57.100
so I wanted him there,
and I think it was a good idea.

34:57.100 --> 34:59.233
>> It was.
I trust both their opinions,

34:59.233 --> 35:01.000
and I think they made
the right choice.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.767
My health does come first,
and I do not want

35:04.767 --> 35:07.500
to do another surgery again.
>> Your immunology

35:07.500 --> 35:10.166
doesn't like breast implants,
and there's a small subset

35:10.166 --> 35:15.767
of girls who react very rapidly,
so who are you to disagree

35:15.767 --> 35:19.266
with your own body?
I mean, if you list the things

35:19.266 --> 35:21.633
that were going on with you,
your issues, right,

35:21.633 --> 35:24.700
you had pain,
you had scarring, right.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.333
There was one up here,
one down here.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.667
It was sort of
a mix of everything, right.

35:28.667 --> 35:30.567
So we got rid of all
the scarring,

35:30.567 --> 35:33.734
we took those implants out
that were up in your neck,

35:33.734 --> 35:36.700
and the pain should be
completely gone now.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.567
Sarah no longer has breast
implants and therefore

35:39.567 --> 35:44.133
will no longer have breast pain.
That's the ideal situation, both

35:44.133 --> 35:48.033
from a cosmetic point of view
and functional point of view.

35:48.033 --> 35:51.000
She's good now. Let's do this.
>> Okay.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.433
>> Yeah, this is awesome.
You're good.

35:53.433 --> 35:57.567
Yeah, you got big breasts.
>> Mm-hmm. They're big. I mean--

35:57.567 --> 35:59.567
>> They're big.
>> They're big. Wow.

35:59.567 --> 36:02.433
I can actually see
the top of my breast.

36:02.433 --> 36:06.300
Just even looking down
is amazing to me.

36:06.300 --> 36:09.033
They're not, you know,
up in my collarbone anymore.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.033
>> We'll keep an eye on things.
There's no chance the nipple

36:11.033 --> 36:13.166
can die, so we're good.
>> Yay.

36:13.166 --> 36:14.433
>> All right.
>> Thank you so much.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.300
>> Hey, thank you, my man.
>> I'll get to work

36:16.300 --> 36:18.200
on that doghouse.

36:22.066 --> 36:23.633
>> Look at the buttock
projection we gave her.

36:23.633 --> 36:25.734
Check this out.
>> That is incredible.

36:25.734 --> 36:34.600
I have to give props to Terry.
Elena's butt looks magnificent.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.533
>> ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

36:38.433 --> 36:40.066
>> Hello.
How are you?

36:40.066 --> 36:41.567
>> Nice to see you.
>> Nice to see you.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.467
>> How are you?
>> Nice to see you.

36:43.467 --> 36:47.200
>> So how do you feel?
>> I feel pretty good.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.066
>> So she had those implants
that were done in Tijuana.

36:50.066 --> 36:51.467
I've never really seen
implants like that.

36:51.467 --> 36:52.734
They're not available
in this country.

36:52.734 --> 36:55.233
They're not really
buttock implants, per se.

36:55.233 --> 36:58.500
So I took them out with the idea
of doing a buttock lift.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.367
When I pulled her buttock up,
there was just no projection.

37:01.367 --> 37:03.100
It was just completely flat.
>> It was flat.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.533
>> Yeah. So you know we all have
those love handles

37:05.533 --> 37:09.333
of fat on both sides,
okay, so I flipped up

37:09.333 --> 37:12.333
the love handle on the right.
I flipped up the love handle

37:12.333 --> 37:14.767
on the left,
and I flipped it down

37:14.767 --> 37:18.467
into the implant pocket,
leaving the inner-central

37:18.467 --> 37:20.600
portions intact
for blood supply.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.066
>> So now my love handle
is in my ass.

37:23.066 --> 37:24.734
I never thought that could
even be a possibility,

37:24.734 --> 37:33.367
to use your own living tissue
to create a butt implant.

37:33.367 --> 37:35.000
>> Look at the buttock
projection we gave her.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.033
Check this out. Remember,
it was completely flat.

37:37.033 --> 37:39.767
Look at this.
>> That is incredible.

37:39.767 --> 37:44.667
I have to give props to Terry.
Elena's butt looks magnificent.

37:44.667 --> 37:48.533
That's why Terry is the second
best surgeon in the world.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.533
Me, of course, number one.
>> Can you see how I narrowed

37:50.533 --> 37:53.133
your waist here?
>> My waist looks great.

37:53.133 --> 37:57.100
I love it. I do, I love it.
Seeing what he did to my waist

37:57.100 --> 38:00.266
was absolutely amazing.
He gave me curves,

38:00.266 --> 38:02.300
and he gave me the butt.
I couldn't even imagine that it

38:02.300 --> 38:05.100
was gonna look the way it does.
>> That's gonna look fantastic.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.133
>> It is.
>> Once it heals,

38:07.133 --> 38:09.367
there's no implant
that can go bad,

38:09.367 --> 38:12.200
nothing funky going on.
I've done these kind

38:12.200 --> 38:15.333
of procedures before
on other parts of the body

38:15.333 --> 38:19.266
but never in the buttock area.
This could be really helpful

38:19.266 --> 38:21.667
when we're faced with these
types of problems in the future

38:21.667 --> 38:25.567
because buttock augmentation is
just getting bigger and bigger.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.567
Keep healing. You're doing well.
>> Thank you so much.

38:27.567 --> 38:29.500
I appreciate it.

38:37.567 --> 38:39.166
Today's my first day
back to work.

38:39.166 --> 38:41.000
I'm gonna see my friends
who haven't seen me

38:41.000 --> 38:43.400
for quite a while,
ever since I did my surgery,

38:43.400 --> 38:46.000
and I think
they're gonna be impressed.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.734
There's no way I would've been
able to get into this outfit

38:48.734 --> 38:52.200
before surgery
without having to go through all

38:52.200 --> 38:56.700
different kinds of crazy things
and hoops of fire to put it on.

38:56.700 --> 38:59.233
>> I can't wait to see her.
>> She will always look amazing,

38:59.233 --> 39:01.567
but hopefully now
she'll be more happy.

39:01.567 --> 39:04.500
>> Yes. Elena was
in so much pain before.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.100
She was not
a happy person at all.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.567
>> What do you think
she's gonna be wearing tonight?

39:09.567 --> 39:11.567
>> Whatever she's wearing,
she's gonna be

39:11.567 --> 39:13.033
showing off her new butt.
>> Of course.

39:13.033 --> 39:15.367
>> She's gonna be amazing.
Elena.

39:15.367 --> 39:19.333
>> Oh, my God.
>> Look at her.

39:19.333 --> 39:21.300
>> Oh, my God.
>> She looks amazing.

39:21.300 --> 39:25.633
>> Look at that butt.
Her butt looks so tight.

39:25.633 --> 39:31.033
It's perfect, perfectly
shaped up, healthy, look nice.

39:31.033 --> 39:34.333
>> He made my waist tiny
and gave me some booty.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.734
>> Can you believe it?
>> And no implants.

39:35.734 --> 39:39.400
I have no implants.
This is all me.

39:39.400 --> 39:42.667
Before my surgery, my implants
were a huge pain in the ass.

39:42.667 --> 39:45.000
I was miserable
because I didn't feel sexy,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.100
and in my profession,
that's a huge problem.

39:47.100 --> 39:50.000
But now the droopiness is gone,
and you can't see

39:50.000 --> 39:52.500
the incision scars at all.
I even have a slimmer waist,

39:52.500 --> 39:56.400
which means even sexier outfits.
My ass is fantastic,

39:56.400 --> 39:59.200
and Dr. Dubrow really
whipped it into shape.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.467
>> You look amazing, strong,
beautiful, sexy.

40:02.467 --> 40:03.734
Oh, my God.
>> Look at her.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.233
I'm so happy for you.
>> Thank you so much.

40:05.233 --> 40:07.100
>> Now you're gonna take
all the clients,

40:07.100 --> 40:11.500
so you're gonna need this.
>> I think I will need this.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.433
>> Oh!

40:19.233 --> 40:21.667
>> I have never worn a dress
like this in front of Chad,

40:21.667 --> 40:24.233
so I can't wait to see
how he's gonna react to it.

40:24.233 --> 40:30.633
What do you think?
>> Wow.

40:30.633 --> 40:32.533
>> ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

40:41.266 --> 40:44.000
>> I'm excited for Chad
to finally take me out for once,

40:44.000 --> 40:47.233
not having to cook
and wash the dishes and clean.

40:47.233 --> 40:49.533
You know, I cook for everybody
all week long,

40:49.533 --> 40:52.100
and I'm just super excited
about not having

40:52.100 --> 40:54.367
to do it tonight.
>> Here you go.

40:54.367 --> 40:55.667
How are you doing today?
>> Pretty good.

40:55.667 --> 40:58.600
>> Wonderful.
The Moscato

40:58.600 --> 41:01.066
and your cran and Coke.
>> Thank you, sir.

41:01.066 --> 41:02.266
Enjoy.
>> Thank you.

41:02.266 --> 41:05.000
I can't wait to see Sarah
and see how she looks.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.033
We rarely get to go out.
I think in the 2 1/2 years

41:08.033 --> 41:10.533
we've been together,
maybe one or two other times

41:10.533 --> 41:12.300
where we've actually
gotten dressed up.

41:12.300 --> 41:15.166
One was the night
that I proposed to her.

41:15.166 --> 41:17.533
>> I have never worn a dress
like this in front of Chad,

41:17.533 --> 41:20.433
so I can't wait to see
how he's gonna react to it.

41:20.433 --> 41:23.266
I finally feel amazing
in my own skin.

41:23.266 --> 41:29.000
It feels so good where I'm at
right now with myself.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.300
Before my surgery,
I had so much pain, and so today

41:32.300 --> 41:35.333
with not living like that
and seeing what it was like,

41:35.333 --> 41:38.567
it's, like, incredible--
to just live without pain

41:38.567 --> 41:41.600
anymore is awesome.
What do you think?

41:41.600 --> 41:45.033
>> Wow. You look amazing.
>> I look incredible?

41:45.033 --> 41:46.734
>> Wow. Hey, baby.
>> I feel great.

41:46.734 --> 41:49.700
>> You look beautiful.
>> Thank you.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.567
The look on Chad's face
is priceless, and I can tell

41:52.567 --> 41:56.033
that he is just as excited
and as happy as I am.

41:56.033 --> 41:58.700
Your eyes are
only focused on one area.

41:58.700 --> 42:00.600
>> Sarah looks
absolutely stunning.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.433
I just want to grab Sarah
and run out the door

42:02.433 --> 42:03.734
and just say forget
the date night,

42:03.734 --> 42:06.467
and let's go back to the house.
It is like night and day.

42:06.467 --> 42:08.467
>> It feels good not to hurt,
and so when you're used to

42:08.467 --> 42:12.066
hurting all the time, like,
now I don't have to worry

42:12.066 --> 42:13.767
about that anymore.
I don't have

42:13.767 --> 42:15.467
to have surgery again.
I don't have

42:15.467 --> 42:18.033
to have them checked out.
There's no risk involved.

42:18.033 --> 42:21.133
It's just my breast,
my own natural breast,

42:21.133 --> 42:23.333
and I'm just so thankful
for that.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.266
I can't imagine going back
to the way I was before.

42:26.266 --> 42:28.467
>> So you won't ever
get breast implants again?

42:28.467 --> 42:31.100
>> I would never get
breast implants again.

42:31.100 --> 42:33.633
I'm so glad that y'all
made that decision.

42:33.633 --> 42:35.667
Before my surgery,
my breasts looked like

42:35.667 --> 42:39.333
two fallen soufflés.
My implants were up to my neck,

42:39.333 --> 42:41.367
and not only was I
in a lot of pain,

42:41.367 --> 42:44.367
but my mobility was limited.
After my surgery

42:44.367 --> 42:47.133
with no implants,
my breasts are au naturel,

42:47.133 --> 42:49.200
and they're like
two perky pears.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.233
My breasts are exactly
where they should've been

42:51.233 --> 42:53.767
in the first place.
I really want to thank you

42:53.767 --> 42:57.100
for doing all this with me.
I mean, it's incredible that

42:57.100 --> 42:59.600
you went through all of this,
and I just want to thank you,

42:59.600 --> 43:02.367
and I love you so much.
>> You're welcome. Cheers.

43:02.367 --> 43:04.233
>> Yes.
>> The journey's almost over.

43:04.233 --> 43:07.233
>> Mm-hmm.
I love you.

43:07.233 --> 43:12.000
>> I love you too.
I can't stop looking.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.300
>> I was born with a cleft lip,
and I've had a lot more issues

43:15.300 --> 43:19.266
with it after the rhinoplasty.
>> Hold on. The whole septum

43:19.266 --> 43:22.266
just destabilized.
>> I love plastic surgery.

43:22.266 --> 43:25.233
Plastic surgery
makes people happy.

43:25.233 --> 43:28.100
>> And we are hot.
>> Yeah, and we know it.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.667
>> I'm a partial paraplegic.
>> How many breast surgeries

43:30.667 --> 43:32.367
have you had?
>> Nine breast surgeries

43:32.367 --> 43:36.000
in three years.
>> Wow. Why?

43:36.000 --> 43:38.233
