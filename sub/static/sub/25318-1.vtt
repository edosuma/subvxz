48:07.101 --> 48:08.537
That's enough.

48:08.581 --> 48:10.583
You can't know it's enough

48:10.626 --> 48:11.714
till you know
what's more than enough.

48:23.030 --> 48:25.728
Check the gauge!

48:29.297 --> 48:30.603
I-I don't know.

48:30.646 --> 48:32.213
It's-it's over 200 pounds.

48:32.257 --> 48:34.476
Given the weight of the rocket,
that's enough thrust

48:34.520 --> 48:36.087
to reach the ionosphere,

48:36.130 --> 48:38.437
if it were pointed
in the right direction.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.917
[laughs]

48:46.097 --> 48:50.057
Perhaps I have, uh,
underestimated you.

49:55.035 --> 49:56.994

50:01.302 --> 50:03.609
[grunting]

50:07.352 --> 50:09.571
What the hell
are you doing?!

50:09.615 --> 50:12.009
[laughing]

50:14.054 --> 50:15.795
You trying
to get yourself killed?

50:15.838 --> 50:17.971
[laughing]

50:18.015 --> 50:20.191
Come on.

50:20.234 --> 50:22.193

[vehicle approaching]

50:42.256 --> 50:44.650
Susan?

50:44.693 --> 50:47.218
Susan!

50:47.261 --> 50:49.916
Susan, where the
devil are you?[door shuts]

50:49.959 --> 50:52.484
We did it.

50:52.527 --> 50:54.660
We proved it
could be done.

50:54.703 --> 50:56.923
No matter what
Caltech decides.

50:56.966 --> 50:58.490
We got to celebrate.
Come on.

50:58.533 --> 50:59.752
What do we have to drink?

50:59.795 --> 51:02.320
Someone left something
on our door.

51:02.363 --> 51:04.539
What?

51:13.505 --> 51:15.507
What could it
possibly mean?
