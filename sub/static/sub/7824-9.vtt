11:25.330 --> 11:27.300
are Roger Myers

11:27.370 --> 11:30.640
- Chairman of the Board of
Itchy & Scratchy International.
- Thank you.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.370
Krusty the Klown,
whose delightful program

11:32.440 --> 11:35.240
brings us the antics
of Itchy and Scratchy every
afternoon at 4...

11:35.310 --> 11:37.380
Hi, Kent! Hyuk, hyuk!

11:37.440 --> 11:39.440
...and joining us live
via satellite from Vienna--

11:39.510 --> 11:42.450
the home of Sigmund Freud, the
world's most famous psychiatrist

11:42.510 --> 11:45.310
to give us an insight
into the human mind,

11:45.380 --> 11:47.610
Dr. Marvin Monroe.
Hiya.

11:47.690 --> 11:51.260
Now, first, let's see what all
the excitement is about.
Here's an example

11:51.320 --> 11:52.480
of the work
currently being turned out

11:52.560 --> 11:54.730
at I. & S. Studios.

11:54.790 --> 11:57.960
( <i>playing "Funeral March
of a Marionette" )</i>

12:00.530 --> 12:02.500
( <i>screaming )</i>

12:02.570 --> 12:03.970
( chuckling quietly )

12:04.040 --> 12:05.370
Hilarious.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.580
Now what in the world is wrong
with that, Mrs. Simpson?

12:07.640 --> 12:08.580
Marvin:
<i>There's nothing
wrong with it.</i>

12:08.640 --> 12:10.880
Excuse me,
he was addressing me.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.600
I know. There's nothing
wrong with it.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.950
Excuse me, there is!
I think that it's a bad
influence on children.

12:16.010 --> 12:17.410
Oh give me a break!

12:17.480 --> 12:20.410
I think that is a bunch
of baloney, and here's why.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.260
In preparing for this debate,
I did a little research,

12:23.320 --> 12:25.060
and I discovered
a startling thing.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.620
There was violence in the past

12:26.690 --> 12:29.060
long before
cartoons were invented.

12:29.130 --> 12:30.930
I see. Fascinating.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.200
Yeah, and there was something
called the Crusades,
for instance.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.390
Tremendous violence,
many people killed!

12:35.470 --> 12:37.040
The darned thing went on
for 30 years.

12:37.100 --> 12:39.170
And this was before
cartoons were invented?

12:39.240 --> 12:40.610
That's right, Kent.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.080
So much
for <i>your viewpoint.
Hmmph.</i>

12:43.140 --> 12:46.410
Dr. Marvin Monroe in Vienna,
would you care to comment
on all this?

12:46.480 --> 12:49.350
Well Kent, to me, the hijinks
of a few comic characters

12:49.410 --> 12:51.440
absolutely pale in comparison

12:51.520 --> 12:53.450
with the crippling
emotional problems

12:53.520 --> 12:55.460
a psychiatrist runs into
every day.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.330
I'm referring
to women who love too much

12:58.390 --> 13:01.330
fear of winning, sex-aholism,
stuff like that.

13:01.390 --> 13:03.320
So you have
no professional objection

13:03.400 --> 13:05.130
to Itchy and Scratchy?

13:05.200 --> 13:08.270
No, not at all. In fact, one of
my guilty little pleasures

13:08.330 --> 13:12.000
is to snuggle up with
a big bucket of buttered popcorn

13:12.070 --> 13:15.280
dim the lights,
turn on Itchy and Scratchy
and laugh myself silly.

13:15.340 --> 13:17.180
What the hell
is wrong with that?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.250
Not a thing.

13:18.310 --> 13:20.210
Now, for
another opinion...

13:20.280 --> 13:20.920
Hyuk! Hyuk!

13:20.980 --> 13:22.520
Hi, kids!

13:22.580 --> 13:24.990
( chuckling ) Krusty, please.
We're giving you an opportunity

13:25.050 --> 13:27.220
to participate
in a serious discussion here.

13:27.290 --> 13:29.290
Oh, I'm sorry, Kent.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.380
It's just when the camera
gets on me...

13:32.460 --> 13:33.760
Hey hey!
Hyuk! Hyuk!

13:33.830 --> 13:36.160
- Krusty!
- ( squeaks toy ) Oh.

13:36.230 --> 13:38.600
Well, it looks like we're
not going to settle this
tonight.

13:38.660 --> 13:40.960
Mrs. Simpson, in the nine
seconds we have left,

13:41.030 --> 13:43.230
can you summarize
your position for us?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.310
Yes. I'd like to ask all the
parents in Springfield

13:45.370 --> 13:48.380
who are concerned about this
to write in

13:48.440 --> 13:51.550
and let the cartoon makers
know how you feel. Thank you.

13:51.610 --> 13:53.410
I don't believe this.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.280
"I will never watch your show,
buy any of your products

13:57.350 --> 14:00.220
or brake if I see you
crossing the street."

14:00.290 --> 14:02.160
Wow! That's cold.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.030
Myers:
<i>"Dear sleaze merchant..."</i>

14:07.090 --> 14:09.530
<i>Oh, come on, that hurts.</i>

14:09.590 --> 14:13.390
<i>Gentlemen, the screwballs
have spoken.</i>

14:17.700 --> 14:21.670
( <i>humming )</i>

14:21.740 --> 14:23.480
( <i>phone ringing )</i>

14:23.540 --> 14:24.480
Hello?

14:24.540 --> 14:25.540
Is this Marge Simpson?

14:25.610 --> 14:27.250
<i>Yes.</i>

14:27.310 --> 14:30.580
The Marge Simpson who fixed it
so cartoons can't be
violent anymore?

14:30.650 --> 14:31.790
<i>Yes.</i>

14:31.850 --> 14:33.520
This is Myers.
I'm here with the writers.

14:33.590 --> 14:36.520
Listen, you're so smart,
how do we end this picture?

14:36.590 --> 14:38.690
Hmm, well, what's the
problem you're having?

14:38.760 --> 14:42.060
Okay, here it is. Itchy just
stole Scratchy's ice cream cone.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.600
Make it a pie.
Pies are easier to draw.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.830
Okay, a pie!

14:45.900 --> 14:48.940
- <i>Anyway, Scratchy is
understandably upset,
- Um-hum.</i>

14:49.000 --> 14:52.610
so we figured he could
grab Itchy and toss him
in a bucket of acid.

14:52.670 --> 14:53.470
Oh, dear!

14:53.540 --> 14:55.410
But then we remembered

14:55.470 --> 14:57.670
that this might be
interpreted as violence

14:57.740 --> 15:00.500
which is morally wrong now,
thanks to you.

15:00.580 --> 15:01.780
So what's your big idea?

15:01.850 --> 15:03.650
<i>How do we end this?</i>

15:03.720 --> 15:05.220
Let's see, um...

15:05.280 --> 15:09.780
Oh, couldn't Itchy
share his pie with Scratchy?

15:09.850 --> 15:12.720
Then they would both have pie.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.760
It's different,
I'll give you that.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.730
<i>Announcer:

15:20.800 --> 15:24.510
<i>It's a jigsaw.
It's a power drill.
It's a wood-turning lathe.</i>

15:24.570 --> 15:26.470
<i>It's an asphalt spreader.</i>

15:26.540 --> 15:28.480
<i>It's 67 tools in one.</i>

15:28.540 --> 15:30.040

15:30.110 --> 15:30.740

15:30.810 --> 15:32.280
$1,000.

15:36.610 --> 15:37.840
It's time for Krusty.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.550
You mean we can watch
cartoons again, Mom?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.360
Yes, dear, all you want.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.920
All right!
All right!

15:43.990 --> 15:45.830
Turn it up.

Lemonade?

16:11.280 --> 16:12.380
Please.

16:12.450 --> 16:14.660
I made it
just for you.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.760
You are my best friend.

16:18.390 --> 16:21.630
Itchy and Scratchy seem
to have lost their edge.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.390
I think it conveys
a very nice message of sharing.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.460
I think it sucks.

16:26.530 --> 16:27.570
( Psycho <i>Theme )</i>

16:27.630 --> 16:28.440

16:28.500 --> 16:29.870
Oh, thank you, Maggie.

16:29.930 --> 16:31.830
This really
hits the spot.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.300
Doesn't it, though?

16:33.370 --> 16:35.580
You make really good
lemonade, Scratchy.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.210
Oh, thank you, Itchy.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.920
Wasn't that funny,
boys and girls?

16:41.980 --> 16:42.920
Well?!

16:42.980 --> 16:44.790
Wasn't it?

16:44.850 --> 16:47.720
Aren't you going to watch
the rest of your cute cartoons?

16:47.790 --> 16:49.360
Nah, come on, Lise.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.730
Maybe there's something else
to do on this planet.

16:57.630 --> 17:03.400
...But the third bowl
of porridge was just right.

17:06.670 --> 17:14.109

Sixth "Pastoral" Symphony )</i>

17:31.730 --> 17:32.830

18:09.470 --> 18:11.870
Hi, kids!

18:11.940 --> 18:14.540
Hyuk! Hyuk! Hyuk!

18:14.610 --> 18:17.440
Uh... is this Saturday?

18:17.510 --> 18:19.780
So, what did
you kids do today?

18:19.840 --> 18:21.470
Me and the guys went fishing.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.580
I almost caught
a catfish this big!

18:23.650 --> 18:24.720
Oh.

18:24.780 --> 18:26.280
And Janey and I went
bird-watching.

18:26.350 --> 18:27.690
We saw a grackle.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.460
That's nice, dear.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.030
C'mon, Lise. Let's go finish
our soap box racers.

18:32.090 --> 18:34.230
Okay.
May we please be excused?

18:34.290 --> 18:34.760
Sure.

18:34.830 --> 18:36.630
Wow!

18:36.690 --> 18:38.990
What great kids.

18:39.060 --> 18:41.090
This is a golden age, Marge

18:41.170 --> 18:43.670
and the parents of Springfield
owe it all to you.

18:43.740 --> 18:47.980
I didn't really expect things
to change this much.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.550
I always knew you'd change
the world for the better.

18:51.610 --> 18:54.550
This will be the art event
of the century.

18:54.610 --> 18:57.640
The greatest masterpiece
of Italian renaissance.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.620
Michelangelo's <i>David</i>

18:59.680 --> 19:01.980
on a coast-to-coast tour
of the United States.

19:02.050 --> 19:04.450
Sir, which cities
will be included
in your itinerary?

19:04.520 --> 19:05.630
New York...

19:05.690 --> 19:07.560
Springfield...

19:07.630 --> 19:10.360
and if we have time,
Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles.

19:10.430 --> 19:12.570

19:12.630 --> 19:14.200

19:15.700 --> 19:17.640

19:17.700 --> 19:19.510
What in the world?

19:19.570 --> 19:21.540
( pounding intensifies )

19:22.610 --> 19:23.680
Get dressed, Marge.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.810
You've got to lead
our protest

19:25.880 --> 19:27.850
against this abomination.

19:27.910 --> 19:30.140
But that's Michelangelo's <i>David.</i>

19:30.210 --> 19:31.910
It's a masterpiece.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.710
It's filth.
It graphically portrays
parts of the human body

19:34.790 --> 19:37.520
which, practical as
they may be, are evil.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.860
But I like that statue.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.750
I told you she was soft
on full frontal nudity.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.460
Come on, girls.

19:48.470 --> 19:49.370
What is this all about?

19:49.430 --> 19:50.830
What do you people want?

19:50.900 --> 19:54.070
We want you to get your big
Italian butt out of here.

20:02.680 --> 20:03.720
That's our topic tonight on
Smartline

20:03.780 --> 20:04.990
Now, Mrs. Simpson,

20:05.050 --> 20:06.890
Why are you
against this statue?

20:06.950 --> 20:08.120
I'm not.

20:08.190 --> 20:10.460
I think everyone in Springfield
should see it.

20:10.520 --> 20:13.330
Wait a minute.
Aren't you Marge Simpson,
the wacko?

20:13.390 --> 20:14.590
( <i>growling )</i>

20:14.660 --> 20:16.260
Yes and no.

20:16.330 --> 20:17.660
How can you be

20:17.730 --> 20:19.900
for one form
of freedom of expression--

20:19.960 --> 20:22.760
like our naked friend over
there-- and be against another

20:22.830 --> 20:24.830
form like Itchy and Scratchy?

20:24.900 --> 20:26.630
Good question.

20:26.700 --> 20:29.400
Well, I guess I can't,
which is a shame

20:29.470 --> 20:32.000
because I really hate
those cartoons.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.980
Oh yeah? What do you say
to all those Marge Simpson
wannabees out there

20:36.050 --> 20:38.450
who wish to suppress
David's doodle?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.420
Um, I don't know.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.790
I guess one person
<i>can make a difference</i>

20:42.850 --> 20:45.380
but most of the time,
they probably shouldn't.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.930
Well, I guess that
settles that.

20:47.990 --> 20:51.460
I'd like to alert our affiliates
that we will be ending our show
early tonight.

20:51.530 --> 20:52.970
Join us tomorrow, when our topic
will be

"Religion: which
is the one true faith?"

Oh.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.710
What's wrong, Marge?

21:37.780 --> 21:41.210
Ah, Homie.
Here the kids had a chance
to see a great work of art

21:41.280 --> 21:42.920
and instead, they're home

21:42.980 --> 21:46.290
watching a cat and mouse
disembowel each other.

21:46.350 --> 21:48.060
Hey, don't worry, Marge.

Pretty soon,
every boy and girl
in Springfield Elementary School

come and see this thing.

They're forcing them!
