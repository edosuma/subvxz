00:49.046 --> 00:51.458
You found what you were
looking for, Mr. Faber?

00:51.481 --> 00:52.755
Thank you for pointing me

00:52.783 --> 00:56.060
in the right direction, Miss Messing.

01:00.123 --> 01:03.036
Anna, what the devil are you doing here?

01:03.060 --> 01:04.061
Hello, William.

01:04.093 --> 01:05.801
What if the Black Hand finds you?

01:05.829 --> 01:07.968
I'm investigating the disappearance

01:07.998 --> 01:09.204
of Lucille Messing.

01:09.232 --> 01:12.441
You should talk to her
fiancé, Geoffrey Coville.

01:12.469 --> 01:15.211
He was so superior.

01:15.238 --> 01:19.118
You enjoy wallowing in filth, don't you?

01:19.142 --> 01:21.554
I don't know much about her,
but the man she took off with,

01:21.578 --> 01:23.251
name of Carling.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.056
I would suggest that there
is more to your librarian

01:26.083 --> 01:27.118
than meets the eye.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.994
Both notes were written in the same hand.

01:30.020 --> 01:33.467
Perhaps someone was
directing Lucille to the book.

01:33.490 --> 01:36.562
Devil... Drum.

01:36.593 --> 01:38.163
If contraception we're not illegal,

01:38.195 --> 01:40.835
families could make those
decisions for themselves.

01:40.864 --> 01:43.071
You mean women could.

01:43.100 --> 01:44.807
I suppose I do.

01:44.835 --> 01:47.645
Your wife is a very spirited woman.

01:47.671 --> 01:49.344
Yes, Julia is wonderful

01:49.372 --> 01:53.013
and not shy about expressing her opinions.

01:53.043 --> 01:55.080
William, what if the
Black Hand has found me

01:55.112 --> 01:58.093
and killed Lucille by mistake?

01:58.115 --> 02:00.459
Hello, Miss Fulford.

02:16.533 --> 02:17.841
Please.

02:19.636 --> 02:21.138
Please, no.

02:34.484 --> 02:35.656
William.

02:35.685 --> 02:37.631
Are you all right?

02:37.654 --> 02:40.999
William, is everything...

02:41.024 --> 02:42.662
Yes, I'm-

02:42.692 --> 02:45.832
I'm just glad you're all right.

02:45.862 --> 02:48.741
The shot was clean and effective.

02:48.765 --> 02:51.439
Doctor, if I may.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.086
I'm sorry, sir.

03:05.115 --> 03:06.685
I've never...

03:08.785 --> 03:12.392
If you could please
return this to the armory.

03:12.422 --> 03:14.595
I thought the library was empty.

03:14.624 --> 03:17.935
He just came out of nowhere.

03:17.961 --> 03:20.168
First strangulation and now a gun.

03:20.197 --> 03:23.610
Our library killer was becoming bolder.

03:25.368 --> 03:28.042
This isn't the man that threatened me.

03:28.071 --> 03:29.243
Just a moment, Doctor.

03:29.272 --> 03:31.684
This isn't the man I spotted in the tavern.

03:31.708 --> 03:33.244
Are you quite sure?

03:33.276 --> 03:36.120
I swear.

03:36.146 --> 03:39.093
That means there were at
least two of them watching you.

03:39.115 --> 03:42.961
Anna, you are no longer safe in this city.

03:49.826 --> 03:52.432
This is a brilliant invention.

03:52.462 --> 03:54.806
Well, it used to be a series of likenesses,

03:54.831 --> 03:57.744
but this seems somewhat more efficient.

04:09.012 --> 04:11.219
William, this is him.

04:11.248 --> 04:13.228
This is the man that I
saw in The Devil's Drum,

04:13.250 --> 04:15.252
the same one that I
talked to in the library.

04:22.459 --> 04:25.269
I thought it was the colic,
but he's not getting better.

04:25.295 --> 04:28.833
Let's see what's bothering
you, young Arthur.

04:31.201 --> 04:33.272
How are you feeling, Mrs. Blackwood?

04:33.303 --> 04:34.281
You look tired.

04:34.304 --> 04:36.477
To tell you the truth, Doctor,

04:36.506 --> 04:40.454
I think I'm with child again.

04:40.477 --> 04:41.785
Mrs. Blackwood.

04:41.811 --> 04:42.949
I thought it couldn't happen

04:42.979 --> 04:44.356
while an infant's still suckling.

04:49.886 --> 04:52.662
Unfortunately, breastfeeding

04:52.689 --> 04:56.865
is not a completely reliable
form of contraception.

04:56.893 --> 04:58.668
Tell that to my husband.

04:58.695 --> 05:00.436
I wish I could.

05:00.463 --> 05:02.773
Doctor, I'm worn to the bone.

05:02.799 --> 05:05.006
How much can a body take?

05:06.803 --> 05:10.478
Mrs. Blackwood, you're strong.

05:14.978 --> 05:17.788
Constable Crabtree, hello.

05:17.814 --> 05:19.293
Dr. Grace.

05:19.316 --> 05:22.297
I'm afraid Detective Murdoch
has gone home for the day.

05:22.319 --> 05:24.230
Then I will leave this report with you.

05:24.254 --> 05:26.393
Excellent.

05:26.423 --> 05:30.064
As you may have heard,
we are to play Station 5

05:30.093 --> 05:32.505
in a game of baseball this Saturday.

05:32.529 --> 05:37.808
Uh, if you're not busy, maybe
you'd like to come by and watch

05:37.834 --> 05:40.542
or cheer us on, as it were.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.140
It's sure to be a good match-up,

05:42.172 --> 05:43.708
and they've made me pitcher.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.185
The pitcher?

05:45.208 --> 05:46.812
That's quite the responsibility.

05:46.843 --> 05:48.379
Inspector Brackenreid seems to think

05:48.411 --> 05:49.890
I'm something of a natural talent.

05:49.913 --> 05:52.223
Well, perhaps I will come along

05:52.248 --> 05:54.694
and see this talent for myself.

06:15.538 --> 06:17.950
Mr. Sato.

06:17.974 --> 06:20.511
Detective.

06:20.543 --> 06:24.355
Have you changed your mind
about engaging my services?

06:24.381 --> 06:26.122
Thank you, no.

06:26.149 --> 06:33.226
But I wondered if perhaps you had ever seen

06:33.256 --> 06:35.031
this man before.

06:35.058 --> 06:36.401
A hot gin, please.

06:36.426 --> 06:38.770
Are you awaiting an escort?

06:38.795 --> 06:39.899
I'll find one.

06:39.929 --> 06:43.069
I don't know him.

06:43.099 --> 06:46.706
I see.

06:46.736 --> 06:48.113
Thank you.

06:53.977 --> 06:56.457
Perhaps you'd care to join me, sir.

06:57.947 --> 07:00.120
I'd be delighted, madam.

07:03.686 --> 07:05.597
And for you, sir?

07:05.622 --> 07:09.297
I'll have a spruce beer.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.464
A spruce beer?

07:12.495 --> 07:13.473
Uh, yes.

07:13.496 --> 07:17.137
Something I developed a taste
for growing up in Nova Scotia.

07:17.167 --> 07:18.908
Oh, I'm pleased to have the company

07:18.935 --> 07:20.437
of such a worldly gentleman.

07:20.470 --> 07:22.848
It would appear we may be well-matched.

07:22.872 --> 07:26.183
Not many unaccompanied ladies
frequent this establishment.

07:26.209 --> 07:27.279
Hmm.

07:27.310 --> 07:28.288
What brings you here?

07:28.311 --> 07:30.518
A friend is something of a regular.

07:30.547 --> 07:33.153
He tells me he's met
interesting people here.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.254
I see he's not mistaken.

07:35.285 --> 07:38.789
It's a bit of a rough neighborhood.

07:38.822 --> 07:40.267
That doesn't worry you?

07:40.290 --> 07:43.965
Not in the company of courteous gentlemen.

07:43.993 --> 07:46.439
Do you find my conduct improper?

07:46.463 --> 07:47.806
Not at all.

07:47.831 --> 07:51.836
Unfortunately, I have to
leave for a prior engagement.

07:51.868 --> 07:53.779
May I have the honor of escorting you?

07:53.803 --> 07:55.111
Thank you, no.

07:55.138 --> 07:57.345
I don't have far to go.

07:57.373 --> 08:01.719
Perhaps we will see each other again.

08:01.744 --> 08:03.223
Until then.

08:18.661 --> 08:20.162
Same red ink, and it's
the same handwriting.

08:20.163 --> 08:21.642
Same red ink, and it's the same handwriting

08:21.664 --> 08:24.338
as the note Lucille
Messing gave to Mr. Carling.

08:25.001 --> 08:26.639
Whatever Lucille was up to,

08:26.669 --> 08:28.706
another woman has taken her place.

08:28.738 --> 08:32.150
Or maybe they were working together.

08:32.174 --> 08:33.677
But at what?

08:33.710 --> 08:35.712
Clearly, the young woman reveled

08:35.745 --> 08:38.419
in creating a spectacle at the tavern.

08:38.448 --> 08:42.054
With no shyness or
concern for her behavior.

08:42.085 --> 08:45.726
Perhaps they were a couple of
amateur dolly mops after all.

08:45.755 --> 08:49.225
But then, why the notes?

08:49.259 --> 08:50.863
Hmm.

08:50.894 --> 08:52.737
So are you going to be following up

08:52.762 --> 08:55.208
on your mystery woman's invitation?

08:55.231 --> 08:58.110
As part of my investigation.

08:58.134 --> 09:03.243
And exactly how far will this
investigation of yours go?

09:03.273 --> 09:04.377
Miss Fulford,

09:04.407 --> 09:08.082
I believe you are
exhibiting signs of jealousy.

09:08.111 --> 09:10.887
Well, where will I be when you're visiting

09:10.914 --> 09:14.123
these strange women in hotel
rooms at this late hour?

09:14.150 --> 09:16.721
You'll be sleeping right here in the cells.

09:16.753 --> 09:18.528
Oh, lovely.

09:18.555 --> 09:23.197
A constable will be keeping
watch until I return.

09:23.226 --> 09:24.637
So is this my life now, is it?

09:24.661 --> 09:25.696
I'm not a criminal,

09:25.728 --> 09:27.435
but I'm gonna have to live like one.

09:27.463 --> 09:28.806
No, no.

09:28.831 --> 09:30.242
You don't have to.

09:31.935 --> 09:34.745
You just have to trust me.

09:43.580 --> 09:47.050
As I was saying, I'm in need
of a new desk sergeant, Jackson.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.994
You might want to consider working here.

09:49.018 --> 09:50.429
It's a good bunch of lads.

09:50.453 --> 09:52.729
I'm doing fine with Inspector O'Kelly, sir.

09:52.755 --> 09:54.325
But not on a desk sergeant's wage.

09:55.658 --> 09:57.160
Come in. Come in. Sit down.

09:57.193 --> 09:58.171
Thank you, sir.

09:58.194 --> 09:59.229
Fancy a drink?

09:59.262 --> 10:01.333
I wouldn't say no.

10:07.470 --> 10:09.472
Thank you, sir.

10:16.312 --> 10:18.417
That's a fine drop of scotch, Inspector.

10:18.448 --> 10:20.249
- It goes down easy.
- Like a where's drawers.

10:21.784 --> 10:24.822
We watch the salty language
here at Station 4, Slugger.

10:24.854 --> 10:27.528
Then I'll be staying
with the boys in Number 5.

10:33.162 --> 10:37.201
I keep telling you, it's money
down the drain on old Pop Smith.

10:37.233 --> 10:39.213
He's over-the-hill
and far beyond.

10:39.235 --> 10:41.374
You're just scared of having
your pants beaten off you

10:41.404 --> 10:42.382
in front of your missus.

10:42.405 --> 10:43.543
Leave my missus out of this.

10:43.573 --> 10:45.814
Yeah?

10:45.842 --> 10:49.016
I hear you leave her
out of a lot of things.

10:49.045 --> 10:50.149
What's that mean?

10:50.179 --> 10:51.658
Oh, it's all right, Jackson.

10:51.681 --> 10:53.126
I won't tell a soul.

10:53.149 --> 10:55.527
We can't all bat a thousand, now, can we?

10:55.551 --> 10:58.225
If you get my meaning, right, Slugger?

10:58.254 --> 10:59.631
You lumbering pile of...

11:04.661 --> 11:06.902
Assault a fellow officer, would you?

11:10.833 --> 11:12.574
You're under arrest, Jackson.

11:16.105 --> 11:19.177
You won't be seeing any homeruns
from behind bars, sunshine.

11:34.724 --> 11:37.034
Undress me.

12:01.117 --> 12:02.926
Hello?

12:07.090 --> 12:09.001
Hello?

12:13.963 --> 12:15.306
Miss?

12:24.741 --> 12:26.186
Miss?

12:27.944 --> 12:29.753
Oh, no.

12:33.816 --> 12:35.762
Any thoughts, Dr. Grace?

12:35.785 --> 12:40.131
Similar ligature marks as
we found on Lucille Messing.

12:40.156 --> 12:42.136
No apparent sign of a struggle,

12:42.158 --> 12:43.762
also like Miss Messing.

12:43.793 --> 12:47.240
Yes.

12:47.263 --> 12:50.039
Nothing to identify the victim with.

12:52.502 --> 12:53.810
Wait.

12:53.836 --> 12:56.248
Her shawl is missing.

12:56.272 --> 12:57.342
Shawl?

12:57.373 --> 12:59.353
Yes, when I saw her several hours ago,

12:59.375 --> 13:02.447
she was wearing a shawl, a silk shawl.

13:02.478 --> 13:04.651
I'm finished here, Detective.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.661
The attendants may take her to the morgue.

13:07.683 --> 13:09.993
Thank you for coming
out at such a late hour.

13:11.788 --> 13:13.597
It's horrible.

13:13.623 --> 13:15.796
To think you were just talking to her

13:15.825 --> 13:17.805
just a few hours before...

13:17.827 --> 13:20.330
Yes.

13:20.363 --> 13:25.676
Don't you ever want to just
leave all this ugliness behind?

13:25.701 --> 13:29.205
I do, but I've made my life here, Anna.

13:29.238 --> 13:31.775
But aren't you curious about the world,

13:31.808 --> 13:33.116
about what's out there?

13:33.142 --> 13:36.055
Well, of course, but...

13:36.078 --> 13:38.820
We're on the cusp of
a new century, William.

13:38.848 --> 13:41.727
Where do you want to be when
the clock strikes midnight?

13:41.751 --> 13:45.665
Easter Island, the Roman ruins of Pompeii?

13:45.688 --> 13:48.669
The Tibetan Steppe, maybe?

13:48.691 --> 13:51.001
I don't think they have clocks in Tibet.

13:51.027 --> 13:53.598
Well, we could take one with us.

13:56.666 --> 13:57.644
What do you mean?

13:57.667 --> 14:00.079
Then we could run away,

14:00.102 --> 14:01.911
travel the Silk Road.

14:04.507 --> 14:08.216
As tempting as your dreams sound,

14:08.244 --> 14:10.918
our first priority must be the Black Hand.

14:10.947 --> 14:12.483
Well, all the more reason

14:12.515 --> 14:14.552
to consider what I'm talking about.

14:14.584 --> 14:18.361
At the moment, lam considering sleep.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.697
So should you.

14:28.030 --> 14:29.031
Strangulation occurred

14:29.065 --> 14:32.012
shortly before you discovered
the body, Detective.

14:32.034 --> 14:33.843
As you speculated.

14:33.870 --> 14:36.851
- I found this in one part of the wound:

14:36.873 --> 14:39.217
Silk.

14:39.242 --> 14:40.846
The missing shawl.

14:40.877 --> 14:43.585
Could she have been strangled
by her own silk shawl?

14:43.613 --> 14:46.560
I would need to match
the shawl to this sample.

14:46.582 --> 14:49.392
All of her clothes were made of fine silk,

14:49.418 --> 14:54.026
some of them quite exotically detailed.

14:54.056 --> 14:57.333
She also wore this.

14:59.729 --> 15:03.575
A winged man, ancient Persian motif.

15:03.599 --> 15:04.703
It's most unusual.

15:04.734 --> 15:06.042
There's more.

15:06.068 --> 15:10.073
She was bound sometime prior to her death.

15:11.741 --> 15:15.211
But the marks are quite superficial.

15:15.244 --> 15:16.951
She doesn't appear to have struggled.

15:16.979 --> 15:19.619
I see.

15:19.649 --> 15:22.493
Take a look at this, Detective.

15:28.758 --> 15:29.930
It's recent.

15:29.959 --> 15:33.099
Similar to the mark on
Lucille Messings neck.

15:37.967 --> 15:39.344
'Sir?

15:39.368 --> 15:41.939
I looked into that room
at The Devil's Drum.

15:41.971 --> 15:44.975
It seems it was rented by
a Mr. R. Stori by the month.

15:45.007 --> 15:46.452
By the month, eh?

15:46.475 --> 15:47.977
Sir, I find no trace of such a person.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.182
I suspect it's an alias.

15:49.211 --> 15:51.851
Hmm, look into that, would you, George?

15:51.881 --> 15:53.189
Has Mr. Carling come in yet?

15:53.215 --> 15:54.694
Sir, he's in the interview room.

15:54.717 --> 15:56.060
Thank you.

15:58.387 --> 16:00.526
What were you doing last night?

16:00.556 --> 16:02.263
I was with my loving wife.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.293
That is a barefaced lie.

16:04.327 --> 16:07.501
I saw you myself last
night near The Devil's Drum,

16:07.530 --> 16:08.702
where, moments later,

16:08.731 --> 16:11.541
that young woman was found
dead in the same establishment,

16:11.567 --> 16:14.673
and there was no loving
wife anywhere to be seen.

16:15.638 --> 16:17.379
Room four.

16:17.406 --> 16:19.113
She told me her name was Doris.

16:19.141 --> 16:20.347
She'll vouch for me.

16:21.544 --> 16:23.490
Do you recognize this woman?

16:23.512 --> 16:25.014
I saw her at The Devil's Drum,

16:25.047 --> 16:27.027
but she was very much alive.

16:27.049 --> 16:28.323
When was this?

16:28.351 --> 16:29.557
A week ago.

16:29.585 --> 16:32.657
I walked by her table, but
she took no notice of me.

16:32.688 --> 16:34.497
You were hoping she would?

16:34.523 --> 16:37.663
I would not have refused the young lady.

16:37.693 --> 16:40.970
Mr. Carling, I can now
connect you to two young women

16:40.997 --> 16:42.340
who have both been murdered.

16:42.365 --> 16:44.641
Your cavalier attitude isn't doing anything

16:44.667 --> 16:46.374
to persuade me of your innocence.

16:46.402 --> 16:49.246
I followed Lucille Messing to a hotel room,

16:49.271 --> 16:51.342
where she instructed me to undress her.

16:51.374 --> 16:54.253
I followed her to the library,
where she denied knowing me,

16:54.276 --> 16:55.687
but I didn't kill her.

16:55.711 --> 16:58.749
As for your latest victim,
I have no idea who she is.

16:58.781 --> 16:59.987
May I go now?

17:00.016 --> 17:01.689
Yes.

17:01.717 --> 17:04.755
But you remain under suspicion.

17:04.787 --> 17:06.925
Mr. Carling.

17:06.955 --> 17:10.869
What were you looking
for at The Devil's Drum?

17:12.127 --> 17:15.405
The unpredictable, Detective.

17:23.939 --> 17:25.849
Excuse me.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.583
Have you seen this woman before?

17:28.611 --> 17:30.716
Looking for a different girl now?

17:30.746 --> 17:32.623
Ah, Jake.

17:32.648 --> 17:36.221
You may recall I pay
very well for information.

17:36.252 --> 17:38.630
Have you seen this woman before?

17:38.654 --> 17:40.827
I wish I could say I did.

17:43.826 --> 17:45.430
Actually, Jake,

17:45.461 --> 17:48.908
I might need your
assistance on another matter.

17:55.304 --> 17:57.648
"Relations not for procreation"?

17:57.673 --> 18:00.813
I don't want this sinful rubbish.

18:05.614 --> 18:08.458
What in the bloody blazes
are you doing with this filth?

18:08.484 --> 18:09.724
Looking after myself for once.

18:09.752 --> 18:11.288
Know your place, woman. Get home.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.129
- When I'm good and
ready. - When I tell you-

18:13.155 --> 18:15.294
- You'll not raise
your hand to this woman.

18:15.324 --> 18:18.464
You, you keep your
perverted ideas to yourself.

18:22.832 --> 18:24.641
Another attempt to assault your wife,

18:24.667 --> 18:26.305
and I will call the constable.

18:29.805 --> 18:31.512
You'll regret this.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.645
Mark my words.

18:36.846 --> 18:38.086
You're absolutely right.

18:38.114 --> 18:39.195
Detective Murdoch has to be

18:39.215 --> 18:41.855
one of the most accomplished
detectives in the modern world.

18:41.884 --> 18:44.125
- His talents would be in demand anywhere:

18:44.153 --> 18:47.498
London, San Francisco, Paris, Rome.

18:47.523 --> 18:49.764
He certainly has an aptitude for languages.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.328
Yes, that he does.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.466
So what or who keeps him in Toronto?

18:54.497 --> 18:58.343
Well, Detective Murdoch is
not the peripatetic type.

18:58.367 --> 19:00.847
I think he finds comfort
being in one place.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.544
I think he thinks of this as being his home

19:03.572 --> 19:06.280
and all of us being something of a family.

19:06.308 --> 19:09.881
Well, maybe a change would do him good.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.392
I recognize this woman.

19:16.418 --> 19:17.488
You do?

19:17.520 --> 19:20.501
Yes, she used to come
into the library regularly.

19:20.523 --> 19:23.060
She used to like books on Persia.

19:24.860 --> 19:28.273
Her name was, uh, Minnie Duggan.

19:50.186 --> 19:51.790
George.

20:05.401 --> 20:07.347
Though I never knew her name.

20:07.369 --> 20:09.781
Miss Messing, you say?

20:11.707 --> 20:15.382
Stanley Faber, our ornithologist.

20:20.082 --> 20:24.497
George, escort Mr. Faber to
the station house, please.

20:33.662 --> 20:37.200
"Slowly he undid each tiny pearl button.

20:37.233 --> 20:41.079
"His hands fumbled at the
sheer delight of the task.

20:41.103 --> 20:44.482
"As my robe fell open to reveal my bodice,

20:44.506 --> 20:47.919
his hand brushed against
the swell of my bosom."

20:47.943 --> 20:50.253
They're silly stories.

20:50.279 --> 20:52.657
What's the harm in reading such nonsense?

20:52.681 --> 20:56.390
Mr. Faber, these stories
are connected to not one

20:56.418 --> 20:58.227
but two murders.

20:58.254 --> 21:01.167
Ll don't know anything about murder.

21:01.190 --> 21:02.897
I don't even know who the other woman is.

21:02.925 --> 21:05.303
But you knew the
whereabouts of the booklets.

21:05.327 --> 21:06.806
How is that?

21:06.829 --> 21:09.571
I'm not the only man
who-who knew about them.

21:09.598 --> 21:10.633
I ask you again, sir:

21:10.666 --> 21:12.942
How did you know where
to find the booklets?

21:14.703 --> 21:16.512
Mr. Faber, do I need to remind you again

21:16.538 --> 21:18.677
of the seriousness of this crime?

21:21.543 --> 21:23.454
It-it was the girl.

21:23.479 --> 21:24.719
What girl?

21:27.650 --> 21:31.097
The dead librarian.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.862
She-she told me where to look.

21:33.889 --> 21:36.495
Lucille Messing.

21:36.525 --> 21:39.005
Yes.

21:39.028 --> 21:40.701
Miss Messing.

21:44.233 --> 21:46.543
One of the booklets is a firsthand account

21:46.568 --> 21:49.674
of Leonard Carling's
encounter with Lucille Messing.

21:49.705 --> 21:51.548
Yes, right down to the
removal of the last garment,

21:51.573 --> 21:52.551
I might add.

21:52.574 --> 21:53.609
Thank you, Crabtree.

21:53.642 --> 21:55.519
And you, put that down. It's evidence.

21:55.544 --> 21:56.648
If I may.

21:56.679 --> 21:57.657
Yes, Anna.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.287
The words used, the
details in the description,

22:01.317 --> 22:03.661
I believe this is
written in a female voice.

22:03.686 --> 22:05.962
Anna is of the opinion
that Lucille Messing,

22:05.988 --> 22:07.228
and now possibly Minnie,

22:07.256 --> 22:09.463
we're willing participants.

22:09.491 --> 22:10.970
Really?

22:10.993 --> 22:14.907
Whoever devised this scheme
sent the girls instructions.

22:14.930 --> 22:17.376
After their assignations were completed,

22:17.399 --> 22:20.869
perhaps they recounted their
adventures to the mastermind.

22:20.903 --> 22:22.246
Who then printed and published

22:22.271 --> 22:23.682
the titillating literature.

22:23.706 --> 22:25.515
But then the shenanigans
went off the rails,

22:25.541 --> 22:26.747
and the women ended up dead.

22:26.775 --> 22:28.516
Lucille Messing, by all accounts,

22:28.544 --> 22:30.080
was a very timid girl-

22:30.112 --> 22:31.921
not an obvious candidate.

22:31.947 --> 22:34.757
How did he know which
women would be willing?

22:34.783 --> 22:37.059
Women send out signals.

22:37.086 --> 22:40.761
Men who know how to
read them will find them.

22:40.789 --> 22:42.530
How do they read the signals?

22:42.558 --> 22:46.233
I wonder if a man could
learn to read the signals.

22:50.933 --> 22:52.913
The man you're looking for, Mr. Falcone,

22:52.935 --> 22:55.677
he's inside.

22:55.704 --> 22:57.411
Always sits in the back.

22:57.439 --> 22:58.440
Important sort.

22:58.474 --> 23:00.181
Type of man I'd like to be in with.

23:00.209 --> 23:02.052
What's your business with him?

23:02.077 --> 23:04.079
That's no matter to you.

23:04.113 --> 23:05.456
Thank you, Jake.

23:05.481 --> 23:08.951
Oh, and I trust our dealings
will stay between the two of us.

23:08.984 --> 23:11.658
Oh, you can count on my word, Mr. Murdoch.

23:15.557 --> 23:19.095
Miss Fulford has not
wronged your organization.

23:19.128 --> 23:20.732
It was her fiancée©.

23:20.763 --> 23:24.870
Nevertheless, I have a
reputation to maintain.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.379
Maintaining this reputation

23:26.402 --> 23:29.440
has already cost you one man, Mr. Falcone.

23:30.939 --> 23:33.579
This Miss Fulford means something to you.

23:33.609 --> 23:36.249
That's no business of yours.

23:36.278 --> 23:39.384
I see.

23:39.415 --> 23:42.055
We will leave her alone.

23:42.084 --> 23:43.290
But?

23:43.318 --> 23:46.265
One day, when the time is right,

23:46.288 --> 23:49.167
you can return the favor.

23:49.191 --> 23:52.172
What do you say?

23:52.194 --> 23:56.472
As long as Miss Fulford
lives, you have my word.

23:56.498 --> 23:58.774
I will return the favor.

23:58.801 --> 24:00.644
Then we have a deal.

24:20.322 --> 24:22.427
Is it really over?

24:22.458 --> 24:24.131
It is.

24:24.159 --> 24:27.504
I feel a lightness in my
step I haven't felt in months.

24:27.529 --> 24:28.701
I can't quite believe it.

24:28.730 --> 24:29.765
I'm free.

24:29.798 --> 24:31.675
Well, you are. Enjoy it.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.442
I can't thank you enough, William.

24:34.470 --> 24:35.870
So now that I'm back at the library,

24:35.871 --> 24:38.545
surely there's a way I can help
you with your investigation.

24:38.574 --> 24:41.180
Yes. Yes, you can.

24:43.712 --> 24:46.556
Try winning the game with your
ringer sitting in my jail cell,

24:46.582 --> 24:47.652
O'Kelly.

24:47.683 --> 24:48.787
' MY ringer?

24:51.019 --> 24:52.464
What's so funny?

24:52.488 --> 24:54.468
Oh, knock yourself out, Brackenreid.

24:54.490 --> 24:57.699
You can keep him locked
up as long as you like.

24:57.726 --> 24:58.830
What do you mean?

24:58.861 --> 25:00.841
You think Slugger Jackson is my ringer?

25:00.863 --> 25:03.343
That lad couldn't hit a
baseball to save his life.

25:03.365 --> 25:05.140
I saw his homerun with my own eyes.

25:05.167 --> 25:06.475
It sailed out of the park.

25:06.502 --> 25:08.504
It was a fluke, Brackenreid.

25:08.537 --> 25:09.572
A fluke.

25:09.605 --> 25:12.313
So if he's not your ringer, who is?

25:12.341 --> 25:14.651
You didn't see my pitcher.

25:20.549 --> 25:22.187
Put that down, George.

25:22.217 --> 25:24.390
Sir, it's important police work.

25:24.419 --> 25:26.660
Have you found the printer of
Miss Rose Petal's booklets yet?

25:26.688 --> 25:27.666
Uh, no, sir.

25:27.689 --> 25:29.191
I still have to compare the watermarks

25:29.224 --> 25:31.226
to some of the various
samples I've collected.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.570
Sir, I think you should listen to this.

25:33.595 --> 25:35.006
"My breath quickened.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.737
"'I would never hurt you, my beauty, '

25:36.765 --> 25:39.939
"he whispered softly as
his nimble brown fingers

25:39.968 --> 25:44.610
tied the soft silk ropes around my wrists."

25:44.640 --> 25:45.880
Silk ropes.

25:45.908 --> 25:48.013
Yes, sir.

25:48.043 --> 25:51.855
"The sultan gave a soft sigh of excitement.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.191
"The door to his tent
fell closed behind him.

25:55.217 --> 25:59.393
I felt of jolt of excitement
as he tied the final knot."

26:01.823 --> 26:03.461
What do you think?

26:03.492 --> 26:06.132
Silk ropes, no struggle:

26:06.161 --> 26:10.303
The story matches the evidence
on Minnie Duggan's body.

26:10.332 --> 26:12.437
Well observed, Constable.

26:12.467 --> 26:15.277
You obviously read the
booklets very carefully.

26:25.614 --> 26:25.955
I thought this matter was settled, Julia.

26:25.981 --> 26:28.291
I didn't intend for
this to be public, Darcy.

26:28.317 --> 26:29.955
We had an agreement that you'd stop this.

26:29.985 --> 26:33.057
Now you're threatening
my career and your own

26:33.088 --> 26:34.761
with this cavalier disregard for the law.

26:34.790 --> 26:36.963
I'm not breaking the law, Darcy.

26:36.992 --> 26:39.768
Section 207 of the
criminal code clearly states

26:39.795 --> 26:42.571
that there's a public good
defense, which I can justify-

26:42.598 --> 26:44.976
- Don't quote legalities at me, Julia.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.980
You're the talk of the hospital.

26:47.002 --> 26:48.242
My promotion's now in jeopardy.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.977
Did you even consider that at all?

26:50.005 --> 26:54.112
Someone has to challenge this law.

26:54.142 --> 26:55.416
But why you?

26:55.444 --> 26:57.685
I can't give a useless iron tincture

26:57.713 --> 27:00.853
to another woman worn out
by continual childbearing.

27:00.882 --> 27:01.917
It's that important to you?

27:01.950 --> 27:03.020
' Yes!

27:03.051 --> 27:05.122
More important than a
promise to your husband?

27:09.391 --> 27:11.928
Yes, officer, initially Lucille Messing

27:11.960 --> 27:13.166
and then Miss Minnie Duggan.

27:13.195 --> 27:15.607
Andrew Trevor.

27:15.631 --> 27:18.441
Do you have any idea what
could've happened to her?

27:18.467 --> 27:19.468
They're both-

27:19.501 --> 27:20.502
Mr. Trevor, can I help you?

27:20.535 --> 27:21.673
Oh, Detective Murdoch,

27:21.703 --> 27:22.943
thank the Lord you're here.

27:22.971 --> 27:24.973
I was just explaining to the constable

27:25.007 --> 27:28.011
that another of my
choir members is missing.

27:28.043 --> 27:29.351
Another one?

27:29.378 --> 27:30.686
Are you quite sure?

27:30.712 --> 27:32.123
Quite sure.

27:32.147 --> 27:34.559
First Miss Messing, and now this?

27:34.583 --> 27:36.187
I now fear that my choir

27:36.218 --> 27:38.858
had some connection to
these dreadful events.

27:38.887 --> 27:40.560
Who's your missing choir member?

27:40.589 --> 27:41.624
Miss Duggan.

27:41.657 --> 27:44.866
Minnie Duggan.

27:44.893 --> 27:48.033
Mr. Trevor, when is
your next choir practice?

27:49.598 --> 27:53.239
All right, everyone, from the beginning.

28:21.730 --> 28:23.539
I Prensa Mm, praise 'mm I.

28:34.209 --> 28:37.190
Minnie Duggan's missing silk shawl,

28:37.212 --> 28:38.623
found in your coat pocket.

28:38.647 --> 28:40.957
I have no idea how that got there.

28:40.982 --> 28:43.019
Why didn't you tell me
you sang in the choir

28:43.051 --> 28:44.894
with your fiancée, Lucille?

28:44.920 --> 28:46.866
I didn't think it was relevant.

28:46.888 --> 28:48.265
No?

28:48.290 --> 28:50.600
When was the last time
you saw Minnie Duggan?

28:50.625 --> 28:52.935
At choir practice last Monday.

28:52.961 --> 28:56.465
She was very consoling about Lucille.

28:56.498 --> 28:58.444
Oh, that's when you realized.

28:58.467 --> 29:00.708
Minnie suspected you
had killed your fiancée.

29:00.736 --> 29:02.716
How dare you suggest such a thing?

29:02.738 --> 29:04.479
You discovered your fiancée, Lucille,

29:04.506 --> 29:07.646
had been living a double
life, so you killed her.

29:07.676 --> 29:10.384
And when Minnie Duggan
discovered what you had done,

29:10.412 --> 29:11.482
you had to kill her as well.

29:11.513 --> 29:15.393
I did not kill Lucille, and
I didn't kill Minnie Duggan.

29:15.417 --> 29:18.591
Geoffrey Coville, you are
under arrest for murder.

29:22.491 --> 29:24.835
The shawl isn't the murder weapon.

29:24.860 --> 29:28.273
The weave of the silk is too coarse.

29:28.296 --> 29:29.331
I see.

29:29.364 --> 29:31.037
I'm sorry, Detective.

29:32.134 --> 29:33.374
Thank you.

29:39.775 --> 29:41.584
Coville knew both women

29:41.610 --> 29:43.749
and had the silk shawl in his possession.

29:43.779 --> 29:45.349
But you don't have the
evidence to hold him?

29:45.380 --> 29:46.518
No.

29:46.548 --> 29:49.791
Sirs, madam, in tracing the watermark,

29:49.818 --> 29:52.128
I found the printer for
Miss Rose Petal's books,

29:52.154 --> 29:53.292
a Mr. Ramston.

29:53.321 --> 29:54.356
And the customer?

29:54.389 --> 29:56.995
A Mr. R. Stori, an alias you may remember

29:57.025 --> 29:59.437
from the room rental at The Devil's Drum.

29:59.461 --> 30:02.169
All payments were in cash
delivered anonymously.

30:02.197 --> 30:03.301
So no further leads.

30:03.331 --> 30:04.708
Well, not exactly, sir.

30:04.733 --> 30:09.148
In talking with the printer
about his previous clients,

30:09.171 --> 30:12.277
I discovered something of coincidence.

30:12.307 --> 30:17.154
He also produces sheet
music for Mr. Trevor.

30:17.179 --> 30:19.887
Trevor the choirmaster?

30:19.915 --> 30:21.724
Very good, George.

30:35.697 --> 30:38.610
Murdoch, look at this.

30:40.402 --> 30:44.407
Oh, have a look at this, sir.

30:44.439 --> 30:48.080
What the devil is going on here?

30:48.109 --> 30:50.453
I demand an explanation, Detective Murdoch.

30:52.013 --> 30:54.926
Explanations are indeed
in order, Mr. Trevor.

30:54.950 --> 30:57.624
Now, if you would kindly
accompany us to the station.

30:59.688 --> 31:02.692
So you got the job,
despite your spirited wife?

31:04.025 --> 31:05.834
Yes, there was no one more surprised than I

31:05.861 --> 31:07.898
when Lamonte announced I
was the new administrator.

31:07.929 --> 31:09.602
It's such good news, Darcy.

31:09.631 --> 31:10.769
When do you start?

31:10.799 --> 31:11.777
Today.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.007
Beginning with the installation of a plaque

31:14.035 --> 31:15.912
to Lamonte's father in the front lobby.

31:15.937 --> 31:17.177
Oh.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.851
And after the foofaraw, what then?

31:19.875 --> 31:20.945
I don't know.

31:20.976 --> 31:23.286
I'll just be getting my feet wet.

31:24.579 --> 31:27.458
I'd very much like you to
endorse the women's clinic.

31:27.482 --> 31:30.190
Julia, there will be no official support

31:30.218 --> 31:31.697
for the advocacy of contraception.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.427
That was made very plain to me.

31:35.891 --> 31:37.370
I see.

31:37.392 --> 31:39.303
Maybe in time.

31:39.327 --> 31:40.931
Of course.

31:44.633 --> 31:46.237
I'll be busy tomorrow.

31:46.268 --> 31:48.874
There's a fundraising
garden party at the Lamontes.

31:48.904 --> 31:51.145
Oh.

31:51.172 --> 31:53.311
Well, I'll admire the flowers.

31:53.341 --> 31:55.821
I'm sure Mrs. Lamonte's roses are splendid.

31:55.844 --> 31:58.381
I don't expect you to come, Julia.

31:58.413 --> 32:01.155
Darcy, I'm more than happy to.

32:01.182 --> 32:04.186
It's just an obligatory
attendance on my part.

32:07.923 --> 32:09.231
What a shame.

32:09.257 --> 32:11.430
I was planning to distribute prophylactics

32:11.459 --> 32:12.494
to the gentlemen present.

32:12.527 --> 32:13.972
Julia, that's not what I was saying.

32:13.995 --> 32:15.906
There's no need to explain.

32:15.931 --> 32:19.003
I'm perfectly happy with
the arrangement, Darcy.

32:19.868 --> 32:21.779
I think it's best for both of us.

32:23.605 --> 32:25.312
I couldn't agree more.

32:42.857 --> 32:44.598
Inspector, carry on.

32:44.626 --> 32:45.832
I need a moment.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.339
This way.

32:49.197 --> 32:51.609
Detective Murdoch.

32:51.633 --> 32:53.544
' Yes?

32:53.568 --> 32:55.673
A colleague of mine, a Mr. Leone,

32:55.704 --> 32:57.775
is going to be taken into custody.

32:57.806 --> 33:00.719
I need to meet you this
Saturday to discuss some options.

33:00.742 --> 33:02.016
That's not possible.

33:02.043 --> 33:04.614
I'm playing in a police
baseball game on Saturday.

33:04.646 --> 33:06.319
My absence will be noted.

33:06.348 --> 33:08.385
Perhaps I'll stroll by.

33:08.416 --> 33:10.327
We can have our conversation afterwards.

33:10.352 --> 33:12.696
It would be amusing to watch

33:12.721 --> 33:15.497
policemen running around
like little children.

33:28.203 --> 33:29.580
My office, George?

33:29.604 --> 33:32.141
I'm in your office, sir.

33:32.173 --> 33:33.151
Why, yes, I know.

33:33.174 --> 33:34.847
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I
had to use your table.

33:34.876 --> 33:36.321
I've cut together some photographs.

33:36.344 --> 33:39.382
I'm trying to analyze this newfangled throw

33:39.414 --> 33:41.860
that the pitcher at
Station 5 has developed.

33:41.883 --> 33:44.329
The ball drops, George, fooling the batter.

33:44.352 --> 33:45.353
Yes, but how?

33:45.387 --> 33:47.264
I believe they call it a "spit ball."

33:47.288 --> 33:49.359
The application of moisture

33:49.391 --> 33:51.234
changes the weight on one side of the ball.

33:52.761 --> 33:54.281
Well, if I'm to play the sport, George,

33:54.295 --> 33:55.899
I took some time to learn about it.

33:55.930 --> 33:57.170
Oh.

33:57.198 --> 34:00.839
You see, as the ball reaches velocity here,

34:00.869 --> 34:04.612
it then drops here.

34:06.374 --> 34:08.047
Excuse me.

34:13.248 --> 34:16.956
That was quite an elaborate
game you devised, Mr. Trevor,

34:16.985 --> 34:19.625
including planting
Minnie Duggan's silk scarf

34:19.654 --> 34:21.759
in Geoffrey Coville's coat.

34:21.790 --> 34:24.235
I don't know what you're
talking about, Detective.

34:24.259 --> 34:26.933
You knew that two of your choir members,

34:26.960 --> 34:28.940
Lucille Messing and Minnie Duggan,

34:28.963 --> 34:30.772
were very impressionable young women,

34:30.799 --> 34:34.110
and you lured them into
your world of perversion.

34:34.135 --> 34:37.081
They confided in you the
stories of their encounters,

34:37.105 --> 34:38.743
and you printed and published them

34:38.773 --> 34:40.775
for yours and other men's amusement.

34:42.243 --> 34:44.917
But when you realized the police
were on to what you were doing,

34:44.946 --> 34:46.983
you had to kill Minnie
Duggan to silence her.

34:47.014 --> 34:49.188
I did no such thing.

34:51.286 --> 34:53.926
You recognize this tie, Mr. Trevor?

34:53.955 --> 34:57.129
. I ma)'-

34:57.158 --> 35:00.332
- This was the tie used
to strangle Minnie Duggan.

35:00.361 --> 35:02.068
Impossible.

35:02.097 --> 35:04.976
Well, the tie matches fibers
found on Minnie Duggan's body.

35:06.167 --> 35:08.977
That tie is readily available
at the Eaton's department store.

35:09.003 --> 35:11.244
There must be a hundred
men walking the streets

35:11.272 --> 35:12.808
wearing the identical one.

35:12.841 --> 35:15.913
There very well may be a
hundred ties, Mr. Trevor,

35:15.944 --> 35:18.857
but there is only one tie pin,

35:18.880 --> 35:25.161
one that matches the wounds
on your victim's necks.

35:25.186 --> 35:27.325
Yours, M r. Trevor.

35:28.289 --> 35:30.997
These young women trusted you,
and you took advantage of them.

35:31.025 --> 35:32.504
No.

35:32.527 --> 35:34.165
Lucille took little persuasion

35:34.195 --> 35:35.970
to venture out and try something new.

35:35.997 --> 35:37.704
She was a romantic,

35:37.732 --> 35:40.645
fascinated by the pain and
beauty of love and obsession.

35:40.668 --> 35:42.375
You no doubt saw her tattoo.

35:44.038 --> 35:45.108
Your idea?

35:45.140 --> 35:46.551
Not at all.

35:46.574 --> 35:48.019
She wanted it.

35:48.042 --> 35:49.453
Lucille Messing wasn't enough.

35:49.477 --> 35:52.048
You then courted Minnie Duggan.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.959
Neither woman was coerced, Detective.

35:54.983 --> 35:59.056
I read the accounts of
Minnie Duggan's encounters.

35:59.087 --> 36:01.260
You preyed on her desire for adventure.

36:01.890 --> 36:04.871
At first, it was small things:

36:04.893 --> 36:07.169
Drinking in public, smoking a cigarette.

36:08.329 --> 36:10.570
And Miss Messing?

36:10.598 --> 36:14.341
When Lucille suggested the tattoo,

36:14.369 --> 36:15.814
I knew I had her.

36:15.837 --> 36:19.011
But you were the master of the game,

36:19.040 --> 36:21.520
a game that escalated from tattoos

36:21.543 --> 36:23.580
to propositioning strangers,

36:23.611 --> 36:25.318
and then escalated again to murder.

36:25.346 --> 36:27.883
That's not what happened.

36:27.916 --> 36:30.396
I didn't kill for pleasure.

36:30.418 --> 36:32.022
The idea repulses me.

36:32.053 --> 36:34.397
Then why did you kill Lucille Messing?

36:35.757 --> 36:37.794
Lucille was the first woman I approached.

36:38.393 --> 36:40.566
When you devised the idea for the books.

36:40.595 --> 36:43.235
Yes, she was a willing accomplice.

36:43.264 --> 36:44.334
She even told other men

36:44.365 --> 36:46.345
where to find the books in the library.

36:46.367 --> 36:48.574
That's when I made my mistake.

36:48.603 --> 36:50.241
Mistake?

36:50.271 --> 36:52.217
I invited Minnie to join.

36:52.240 --> 36:55.244
When Lucille found out, she was angry.

36:55.276 --> 36:57.847
Our special relationship
had been sullied in her eyes.

36:57.879 --> 36:58.857
She felt betrayed.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.553
She threatened to expose me.

37:00.582 --> 37:04.860
So you killed her to protect yourself?

37:04.886 --> 37:06.263
And you also killed Minnie Duggan

37:06.287 --> 37:07.698
for the same reason.

37:07.722 --> 37:09.599
What kind of man are you?

37:09.624 --> 37:11.900
I had no choice, Detective.

37:15.296 --> 37:16.741
I had no choice.

37:20.235 --> 37:21.873
So when Lucille talked of betrayal,

37:21.903 --> 37:23.644
it wasn't of her fiancée©,

37:23.671 --> 37:25.878
but of sharing Trevor's
games with Minnie Duggan.

37:25.907 --> 37:28.114
Yes.

37:28.142 --> 37:30.315
Do you think she was in love with Trevor?

37:30.345 --> 37:32.450
No, I don't think so.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.154
Trevor thought he had power over her,

37:35.183 --> 37:38.426
but Miss Messing felt like
she was very much in control

37:38.453 --> 37:40.330
and didn't want to share that with anyone.

37:40.355 --> 37:44.599
To think Lucille buried
that welter of emotion

37:44.626 --> 37:47.835
behind such a timid exterior...

37:50.832 --> 37:52.243
Anna.

37:52.267 --> 37:54.213
' Yes?

37:58.206 --> 38:00.186
What do you want to say, William?

38:04.145 --> 38:04.211
Hello, Emily.

38:04.212 --> 38:05.282
Hello, Emily.

38:05.313 --> 38:07.452
- Good to see you, Julia.
- Hello.

38:07.482 --> 38:09.587
Come on, Crabtree!

38:10.618 --> 38:12.427
William in knickerbockers.

38:12.453 --> 38:14.797
Maybe he's coming out of his shell.

38:14.822 --> 38:17.666
Well, look at our pitcher.

38:17.692 --> 38:20.673
Constable Crabtree is
looking positively striking.

38:20.695 --> 38:22.538
Indeed he is.

38:22.563 --> 38:23.974
All right, George, all right.

38:23.998 --> 38:26.706
- Chucks it like a tart.
- Right in the middle.

38:31.539 --> 38:33.041
Oh!

38:33.074 --> 38:34.052
That's it.

38:39.914 --> 38:42.485
Strike!

38:42.517 --> 38:45.020
That was good, eh?

38:48.589 --> 38:49.897
Oh!

38:49.924 --> 38:51.198
Time.

38:51.225 --> 38:53.136
Trust the science, George.

38:53.161 --> 38:55.141
Remember the drop of the ball.

38:55.163 --> 38:58.167
Hit six inches below where you
think the ball is going to be.

38:58.199 --> 39:00.577
Imagine the ball to be in a different place

39:00.601 --> 39:01.909
than it actually is,

39:01.936 --> 39:04.246
and then swing where it isn't.

39:04.272 --> 39:05.376
Exactly.

39:05.406 --> 39:06.817
Away you go-

39:10.945 --> 39:12.390
- Come on, George.
- Crabtree.

39:21.456 --> 39:22.434
Oh, good shot, Crabtree!

39:22.457 --> 39:23.834
Very well done, George!

39:23.858 --> 39:25.235
Ho, ho, ho!

39:25.259 --> 39:26.567
Well done, George!

39:26.594 --> 39:28.039
Very good!

39:28.062 --> 39:29.871
What the bloody hell
just happened, Murdoch?

39:29.897 --> 39:31.057
Well, sir, the ball appears

39:31.065 --> 39:32.567
to be coming straight at the batter,

39:32.600 --> 39:33.840
but the physics would suggest-

39:33.868 --> 39:34.846
I don't care how.

39:34.869 --> 39:36.177
Just makes sure it happens again.

39:36.204 --> 39:40.209
Right. Gentlemen, gentlemen, huddle up.

39:40.241 --> 39:41.720
All right, Henry, have an eye.

39:56.057 --> 39:58.037
That's in!

40:00.661 --> 40:01.696
' Yes!

40:18.079 --> 40:19.581
Oh.

40:19.614 --> 40:21.616
- It's all me!
- Watch it, sir!

40:21.649 --> 40:23.720
Oh, well done, gentlemen!

40:23.751 --> 40:25.992
Well done!

40:26.020 --> 40:28.626
Crabtree, you're up first.

40:34.095 --> 40:35.096
Come on, Higgins!

40:35.129 --> 40:36.574
Bring me home, buddy.

40:36.597 --> 40:37.905
Bring me home!

40:42.370 --> 40:44.816
Excellent hit, sir!

40:47.475 --> 40:48.510
Well done.

41:00.354 --> 41:01.697
Come on, sir.

41:33.888 --> 41:35.697
And it's out!

41:35.723 --> 41:38.727
Here, here, sir!

41:38.759 --> 41:39.829
Let's go! Let's go!

41:46.434 --> 41:48.744
Jolly good, sir!

42:00.882 --> 42:03.362
Whoo!

42:10.958 --> 42:11.993
To the untrained eye,

42:12.026 --> 42:14.905
the ball looks like it's
coming in a certain height,

42:14.929 --> 42:16.169
but actually it's way down...

42:16.197 --> 42:18.108
Such a perfect summer's day.

42:18.132 --> 42:19.770
You think so?

42:19.800 --> 42:21.336
Oh, come on, William.

42:21.369 --> 42:22.848
You won the ball game.

42:22.870 --> 42:24.508
The sun's shining.

42:24.539 --> 42:25.950
You and I are together.

42:25.973 --> 42:27.043
What would you change?

42:27.074 --> 42:28.280
It's perfect.

42:28.309 --> 42:31.882
Well, I suppose you're right.

42:34.148 --> 42:35.752
Let's stroll back.

42:43.224 --> 42:47.598
Anna!

42:47.628 --> 42:48.606
No!

42:48.629 --> 42:52.202
Help!

42:52.233 --> 42:53.576
George!

42:53.601 --> 42:55.308
I see him, sir!

43:03.177 --> 43:05.157
Anna!

43:06.847 --> 43:08.155
Julia!

43:08.182 --> 43:09.627
Julia, help me!

43:15.489 --> 43:16.797
- William.
- No!

43:16.824 --> 43:17.894
I'm so sorry.

43:17.925 --> 43:19.336
" No!"

43:25.533 --> 43:27.604
You!

43:27.635 --> 43:29.080
You murdering coward!

43:29.103 --> 43:30.104
This wasn't us.

43:30.137 --> 43:31.115
You hired the boy!

43:31.138 --> 43:32.617
We had nothing to do with this.

43:56.731 --> 43:59.712
We couldn't charge the bastard.

43:59.734 --> 44:02.271
There was nothing to connect
him to Miss Fulford's murder.

44:02.303 --> 44:03.714
What about the boy?

44:03.738 --> 44:05.217
He got away.

44:05.239 --> 44:08.311
I'm sorry, Murdoch.

44:08.342 --> 44:09.878
Thank you, sir.

44:09.910 --> 44:13.517
Falcone said something
curious before he left.

44:13.547 --> 44:16.118
"Tell Murdoch the debt has been paid."

44:16.150 --> 44:18.061
What was he talking about?

44:18.085 --> 44:20.895
I wouldn't know, sir.

44:32.033 --> 44:34.104
She's ready.

44:51.686 --> 44:53.893
We must hurry.

44:53.921 --> 44:56.197
Thank you for your help, Julia.

45:02.396 --> 45:03.875
We're all set, Miss Fulford.

45:03.898 --> 45:05.741
So you're my traveling companion, Jake?

45:05.766 --> 45:07.905
I'll take her out as far
as Kingston, but then-

45:07.935 --> 45:09.209
Then I'm on my own.

45:14.442 --> 45:16.786
Thank you, William.

45:23.484 --> 45:26.226
For midnight on the Tibetan Steppe.

45:27.054 --> 45:29.625
Well, I hope it keeps good time.

45:29.657 --> 45:31.432
That it does.

45:35.996 --> 45:38.738
Thank you for my freedom.

46:14.168 --> 46:16.512
"I never thought it could happen to me.

46:16.537 --> 46:20.883
"Just last Sunday I was in
the park to feed the ducks..."

46:25.679 --> 46:28.182
Swans.

46:32.286 --> 46:34.823
"Swans.

46:40.361 --> 46:43.205
"When a young lady approached me.

46:43.230 --> 46:47.508
"I found her most beguiling,

46:47.535 --> 46:52.245
and she was indeed entranced with me."
