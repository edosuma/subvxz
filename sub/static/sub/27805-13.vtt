Whew. I don't know
what's happening to me.

00:04.086 --> 00:06.798
I have never been happier,
but the closer the wedding gets,

00:06.840 --> 00:09.189
the more I feel the urge
to burst into tears.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.207
I don't even get why you
guys want to get married.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.473
I mean, look at Dad.
He's been married four times.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.850
Once just 'cause
he wanted new silverware.

00:17.916 --> 00:19.038
My point is,

00:19.073 --> 00:22.105
you want to ruin a relationship,
get married.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.108
Yeah, I maybe wouldn't lead
with that in your toast.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.944
[knock on door]

00:31.198 --> 00:33.158
[voice breaking]: Hey, Dad.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.244
See, it's happening again.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.039
- What's with her?
- Marriage.

00:40.235 --> 00:42.209
Clem. Shannon.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.293
Guy who's getting me a beer.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.255
Hey, he acknowledged me!

00:48.255 --> 00:49.049
What's up, Dad?

00:49.091 --> 00:52.552
First of all, how flexible is
this start time for the wedding?

00:52.594 --> 00:54.930
'Cause I found some Yankee tickets...

00:54.972 --> 00:56.765
In the pocket of a dead
guy at a crime scene?

00:56.807 --> 00:58.100
Nailed it, sweetheart.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.770
You have to be on time, Dad.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.271
You're walking me down the aisle.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.690
For once in your life,
do the right thing

01:04.730 --> 01:07.609
and sell that murder
victim's tickets on StubHub.

01:09.186 --> 01:10.988
Okay, okay.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.197
Of course. I'll be there.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.118
Anyway, I got something
I want to give you.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.622
A camcorder from 1980.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.293
You shouldn't have.
And it is strange that you did.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.213
No, it's what's on the VHS tape inside.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.133
The camcorder's just to hook up
to your TV so you can watch it.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.551
So, what's on the tape?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.720
Well, you remember when you were ten

01:34.761 --> 01:36.555
and your mom died?

01:37.252 --> 01:39.307
Yes.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.852
Well, she knew
it was coming for a while,

01:41.893 --> 01:44.730
and, uh, she made
this tape for you, Clem.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.566
She asked me to give it to you
shortly before your wedding.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.443
Seriously?

01:49.484 --> 01:50.902
I can't believe this.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.988
Should I watch it now?

01:53.071 --> 01:55.532
Up to you.
But I will need this camcorder back.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.868
I'm watching Caddyshack this weekend.

01:58.994 --> 02:02.205
I can't believe I'm
gonna get to see my mom.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.331
Wow.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.495
You know, I got to say, Freddy, I mean,

02:04.567 --> 02:06.739
- for you to keep something like this...
- Dibs on leather chair.

02:06.819 --> 02:08.919
Yeah. [grunts]

02:08.961 --> 02:11.047
All right. Here we go.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.300
Hi, Clemmy.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.135
If you're watching this,

02:15.177 --> 02:16.928
you are about to be married.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.847
And your dad hasn't lost this tape.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.266
Both of which are
things to be celebrated.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.772
Uh, nothing would make me happier

02:26.813 --> 02:29.316
than to be able to be
there with you today.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.360
To get to know the person
that you've chosen.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.863
To see my beautiful
little girl all grown-up.

everything about marriage,

you one piece of advice,

crazy thing?

Hell yes, it does.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.833

why I love that woman.
