(wind blowing)

03:29.944 --> 03:33.011
(electricity humming)

03:35.583 --> 03:37.616
- Witness this army

03:37.618 --> 03:40.219
of such mass and charge

03:40.221 --> 03:44.089
led by a delicate
and tender prince,

03:44.091 --> 03:47.759
whose spirit with
divine ambition puffed

03:47.761 --> 03:51.230
makes mouths at the
invisible event,

03:51.232 --> 03:54.700
exposing what is
mortal and unsure

03:54.702 --> 03:58.904
to all that fortune,
death, and danger dare,

04:00.140 --> 04:02.074
even for an egg shell.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.380
(gentle instrumental music)

04:08.382 --> 04:09.915
- Stand ho.
Who's there?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.017
- Friends to this ground
and liegemen to the Dane.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.018
- Give you good night.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.186
- Who hath relieved you?

04:14.188 --> 04:15.354
- Bernardo hath my place.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.288
Give you good night.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.362
- Holla, Bernardo.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.429
- Say, what, and
is Horatio there?

04:24.431 --> 04:26.031
- A piece of him.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.132
- Welcome, Horatio.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.400
Welcome, good Marcellus.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.336
- What, has this thing
appeared again tonight?

04:31.338 --> 04:32.571
- [Bernardo] I
have seen nothing.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.206
- Horatio says 'tis
but our fantasy

04:34.208 --> 04:36.174
and will not let
belief take hold of him

04:36.176 --> 04:38.410
touching this dreaded
sight twice seen of us.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.145
Therefore I have entreated
him along with us

04:40.147 --> 04:41.813
to watch the minutes
of this night,

04:41.815 --> 04:44.016
that if again this
apparition comes,

04:44.018 --> 04:46.952
he may approve our
eyes and speak to it.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.086
(bell ringing)

04:48.088 --> 04:49.154
- 'Twill not appear.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.991
- Sit down a while
and let us once again

04:52.993 --> 04:57.029
assail your ears that are so
fortified against our story

04:57.031 --> 04:59.431
what we have two nights seen.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.100
- Peace, break thee off.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.702
Look where it comes again.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.070
(wailing)

05:05.072 --> 05:07.105
in the same figure of
the king what's dead.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.142
- I'll cross it
though it blast me.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.378
Stay, illusion.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.380
(bell ringing)

05:15.382 --> 05:20.052
If thou hast any sound or
use of voice, speak to me.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.057
If there be any good
thing to be done

05:25.059 --> 05:27.893
that may to thee do
ease and grace to me,

05:31.865 --> 05:32.764
speak to me.

05:32.765 --> 05:33.664
If thou art privy to
thy country's fate

05:33.667 --> 05:36.668
which happily
foreknowing may avoid.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.437
(shrieking)

05:38.439 --> 05:39.237
- 'Tis here.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.039
- 'Tis here.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.741
- 'Tis gone.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.610
(alarm ringing)

05:45.612 --> 05:48.080
(mumbling)

05:59.460 --> 06:01.960
- Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death,

06:01.962 --> 06:03.228
the memory be green

06:04.698 --> 06:08.367
and that it us befitted to
bear our hearts in grief

06:08.369 --> 06:09.634
and our whole kingdom

06:09.636 --> 06:12.170
to be contracted
in one brow of woe,

06:13.307 --> 06:15.674
yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature

06:15.676 --> 06:18.877
that we with wisest
sorrow think on him

06:18.879 --> 06:22.247
together with
remembrance of ourselves.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.151
(birds chirping)

06:26.153 --> 06:30.789
Therefore, our sometime
sister, now our queen,

06:30.791 --> 06:32.991
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state,

06:32.993 --> 06:37.496
have we as 'twere
with a defeated joy,

06:37.498 --> 06:40.332
with an auspicious
and a dropping eye,

06:40.334 --> 06:44.269
with mirth in funeral and
with dirge in marriage,

06:44.271 --> 06:48.240
in equal scale weighing delight
and dole, taken to wife,

06:50.477 --> 06:53.912
nor have we herein barred
your better wisdoms,

06:53.914 --> 06:57.616
which have freely gone
with this affair along.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.384
For all, our thanks,

07:00.320 --> 07:01.486
so much for him,

07:01.488 --> 07:04.156
(wood knocking)

07:05.359 --> 07:07.592
(door creaking)

07:07.594 --> 07:09.027
and now Laertes.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.630
What's the news with you?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.099
You told us of some suit.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.333
What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,

07:15.335 --> 07:18.303
that shall not be my
offer, not thy asking?

07:18.305 --> 07:21.306
- My dread lord, your leave
and favor to return to France,

07:22.242 --> 07:23.575
from whence though
willingly I came

07:23.577 --> 07:25.377
to show my duty in
your coronation,

07:25.379 --> 07:28.713
yet now I must confess
that duty done.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.183
My thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France

07:31.185 --> 07:34.052
and bow them to your
gracious leave and pardon.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.987
- [Claudius] Have you
your father's leave?

07:35.989 --> 07:36.955
What says Polonius?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.024
- Hath, my lord, rung from me

07:39.026 --> 07:42.561
my slow leave by
labors and petition,

07:42.563 --> 07:46.665
and at last, upon his will,
I sealed my hard consent.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.436
I do beseech you
give him leave to go.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.370
(metal clattering)

07:52.372 --> 07:54.372
- Take thy fair hour, Laertes.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.642
Time be thine, and thy best
graces spend it at thy will,

08:00.447 --> 08:04.216
but now, my cousin
Hamlet and my son--

08:04.218 --> 08:06.351
- [Hamlet] A little more
than kin and less than kind.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.387
- [Claudius] How is it the
clouds still hang on you?

08:09.389 --> 08:10.989
- Not so, my lord.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.557
I am too much in the sun.

08:14.561 --> 08:15.427
- Good Hamlet,

08:15.428 --> 08:16.294
do not forever with
thy veiled lids

08:16.296 --> 08:19.397
seek for thy noble
father in the dust.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.099
Thou knowest 'tis common.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.602
All that lives must die,

08:23.604 --> 08:25.971
passing through
nature to eternity.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.239
- Aye, madam.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.373
It is common.

08:28.375 --> 08:32.277
- If it be, why seems it
so particular with thee?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.345
- Seems, madam?

08:34.381 --> 08:36.280
Nay, it is.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.416
I know not seems.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.052
'Tis not alone my inky
cloak, good mother,

08:41.054 --> 08:43.321
nor customary suits
of solemn black,

08:43.323 --> 08:45.590
nor windy suspiration
of forced breath,

08:45.592 --> 08:48.326
no, nor the fruitful
river in the eye,

08:48.328 --> 08:50.228
nor the dejected
havior of the visage,

08:50.230 --> 08:52.430
together with all forms, moods,

08:52.432 --> 08:54.966
shapes of grief, that
can denote me truly.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.270
These indeed seem,
for they are actions

08:58.272 --> 08:59.304
that a man might play,

08:59.306 --> 09:02.340
but I have that within
which passes show,

09:02.342 --> 09:07.412
these but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.882
(gentle instrumental music)

09:10.884 --> 09:11.950
- 'Tis sweet

09:13.520 --> 09:15.453
and commendable in
your nature, Hamlet,

09:15.455 --> 09:17.756
to give these mourning
duties to your father,

09:19.359 --> 09:21.826
but you must know your
father lost a father.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.131
That father lost, lost
his, and the survivor bound

09:26.133 --> 09:30.235
in filial obligation for some
term to do obsequious sorrow,

09:32.239 --> 09:36.541
but to persevere in
obstinate condolement

09:36.543 --> 09:39.778
is a course of
impious stubbornness.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.414
'Tis a fault to heaven,

09:43.517 --> 09:46.051
a fault against the
dead, a fault to nature,

09:46.053 --> 09:47.852
to reason most absurd,

09:47.854 --> 09:50.956
whose common theme
is death of fathers,

09:50.958 --> 09:52.257
and who still hath cried

09:52.259 --> 09:54.492
from the first corpse
till he that died today,

09:54.494 --> 09:56.294
"This must be so."

09:56.296 --> 09:57.996
(wind blowing)

09:57.998 --> 10:01.933
We pray you, throw to
earth this unprevailing woe

10:01.935 --> 10:04.202
and think of us as of a father,

10:06.807 --> 10:09.207
for your intent in going
back to school in Wittenberg,

10:09.209 --> 10:12.377
it is most retrograde
to our desire,

10:12.379 --> 10:13.912
and we beseech you, bend you,

10:13.914 --> 10:17.816
to remain here in the cheer
and comfort of our eye,

10:17.818 --> 10:21.620
our chiefest courtier,
cousin, and our son.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.491
- Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.595
I pray thee, stay with us.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.565
Go not to Wittenberg.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.437
- I shall in all my
best obey you, madam.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.240
(birds chirping)

10:43.644 --> 10:46.511
(wood creaking)

10:51.351 --> 10:54.986
(gentle instrumental music)

10:59.393 --> 11:02.227
(door creaking)

11:05.532 --> 11:09.534
Oh, that this too, too
sullied flesh would melt,

11:11.204 --> 11:15.306
thaw, and resolve
itself into a dew,

11:17.978 --> 11:19.744
or that the everlasting
had not fixed

11:19.746 --> 11:21.579
his canon against
self-slaughter.

11:21.581 --> 11:22.447
Oh, God.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.850
God.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.554
How weary, stale,
flat, and unprofitable

11:29.556 --> 11:31.656
seem to me all the
uses of this world.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.526
Fie on it.

11:35.962 --> 11:36.828
Fie.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.332
'Tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.005
All things rank and gross
in nature possess it merely,

11:47.007 --> 11:48.573
that it should come to this,

11:48.575 --> 11:51.443
but two months dead, nay,
not so much, not two,

11:51.445 --> 11:54.312
so excellent a king
that was to this

11:54.314 --> 11:56.114
Hyperion to a satyr,

11:56.116 --> 11:57.716
so loving to my mother

11:57.718 --> 11:59.284
that he might not
between the winds

11:59.286 --> 12:01.286
of heaven visit her
face too roughly.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.954
Heaven and Earth,
must I remember?

12:04.991 --> 12:06.324
Why, she would hang on him

12:06.326 --> 12:08.526
as if increase of
appetite had grown

12:08.528 --> 12:10.962
by what it fed on, and
yet within a month,

12:14.134 --> 12:15.100
let me not think on it.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.168
Frailty, thy name is woman.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.506
A little month, or ere
those shoes were old

12:21.508 --> 12:23.641
with which you followed
my poor father's body,

12:23.643 --> 12:25.310
like Niobe, all tears,

12:25.312 --> 12:28.279
why she, even she,

12:29.649 --> 12:32.283
oh God, a beast that
wants discourse of reason

12:32.285 --> 12:34.619
would have mourned longer,
married with my uncle,

12:34.621 --> 12:36.121
my father's brother,

12:36.123 --> 12:38.923
but no more like my
father than I to Hercules.

12:38.925 --> 12:39.991
Within a month,

12:41.128 --> 12:43.695
ere yet the salt of
most unrighteous tears

12:43.697 --> 12:46.097
have left the flushing
in her galled eyes,

12:46.099 --> 12:47.098
she married.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.333
(cutlery rattling)

12:48.335 --> 12:50.435
- You don't want
veggies (mumbling)?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.736
- [Hamlet Voiceover]
Oh most wicked speed,

12:51.738 --> 12:54.939
to post with such dexterity
to incestuous sheets.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.942
(mumbling)

12:57.944 --> 13:01.513
It is not, nor it
cannot come, to good,

13:02.682 --> 13:05.350
but break, my heart, for
I must hold my tongue.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.919
- [Man] Cheers.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.687
Cheers, cheers.

13:09.689 --> 13:10.789
(mumbling)

13:10.791 --> 13:13.391
(cutlery rattling)

13:13.393 --> 13:15.727
(wind blowing)

13:15.729 --> 13:18.563
(machine running)

13:28.708 --> 13:29.774
(water flowing)

13:29.776 --> 13:32.443
(bird cawing)

13:33.780 --> 13:35.814
(laughing)

13:35.816 --> 13:38.349
- Hail to your lordship.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.018
- I'm glad to see you well.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.490
Horatio?

13:45.492 --> 13:46.291
(laughing)

13:46.293 --> 13:47.692
Or I do forget myself?

13:47.694 --> 13:49.127
- The same, my lord,

13:49.129 --> 13:51.496
(laughing)

13:52.632 --> 13:54.532
and your poor servant ever.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.601
- Sir, my good friend, I'll
change that name with you,

13:56.603 --> 13:58.736
and what make you from
Wittenberg, Horatio?

13:58.738 --> 13:59.571
Marcellus.

13:59.573 --> 14:00.505
- [Marcellus] My good lord.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.207
- I am very glad to
see you, but what,

14:02.209 --> 14:03.341
in faith, make you
from Wittenberg?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.776
- A truant disposition,
good my lord.

14:04.778 --> 14:07.378
- [Hamlet] I would not
hear your enemy say so,

14:07.380 --> 14:08.646
but what is your
affair in Elsinore?

14:08.648 --> 14:10.748
We'll teach you to drink
deep ere you depart.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.117
- My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.786
- I prithee, do not
mock me, fellow student.

14:14.788 --> 14:17.155
I think it was to see
my mother's wedding.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.657
- [Horatio] Indeed, my
lord, it followed hard upon.

14:20.594 --> 14:21.759
- Thrift.

14:21.761 --> 14:22.660
Thrift, Horatio.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.229
The funeral baked meats

14:24.231 --> 14:26.431
did coldly furnish forth
the marriage tables.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.599
My father,

14:27.601 --> 14:29.801
(bird cawing)

14:29.803 --> 14:31.469
methinks I see my father.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.339
- Where, my lord?

14:34.341 --> 14:35.773
- In the mind's eye, Horatio.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.809
- [Horatio] My lord, I
think I saw him yesternight.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.978
- Saw who?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.513
- [Horatio] My lord,
the king, your father.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.217
- The king, my father?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.986
- Season your admiration
a while with an attent ear

14:47.988 --> 14:50.955
till I may deliver
this marvel to you.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.557
Two nights together
had these gentlemen,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.492
Marcellus and Bernardo,
upon their watch

14:54.494 --> 14:56.561
in the dead waste and
middle of the night,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.463
been thus encountered.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.631
A figure like your father

14:59.633 --> 15:01.900
appears before them
and with solemn march

15:01.902 --> 15:04.869
goes slow and stately by them,

15:04.871 --> 15:06.838
and I with them the third
night kept the watch,

15:06.840 --> 15:09.040
where, as they had
delivered both in time,

15:09.042 --> 15:11.910
form of the thing, each
word made true and good.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.578
The apparition comes.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.213
I knew your father.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.248
These hands are not more like.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.716
- [Hamlet] But where was this?

15:18.718 --> 15:20.485
- [Marcellus] My lord, upon
the platform where we watched.

15:20.487 --> 15:24.656
- Did you not speak to it?
- My lord, I did, but
answer made it none.

15:24.658 --> 15:25.924
- I would I had been there.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.892
- [Horatio] It would
have much amazed you.

15:27.894 --> 15:28.826
- I will watch tonight.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.295
Perchance 'twill walk again.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.631
If it assume my noble
father's person,

15:33.633 --> 15:34.999
I'll speak to it,

15:35.001 --> 15:36.935
though hell itself should
gape and bid me hold my peace,

15:36.937 --> 15:38.503
so fare you well.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.972
Upon the platform 'twixt 11:00
and 12:00, I'll visit you.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.674
- Our duty to your honor.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.075
- Your loves, as mine to you.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.610
Farewell.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.111
(gentle instrumental music)

15:47.113 --> 15:48.913
- Do not sleep,
but let me hear from you.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.782
- Do you doubt that?

15:52.852 --> 15:53.718
- For Hamlet

15:56.122 --> 15:57.989
and the trifling of his favor.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.160
Hold it a fashion
and a toy in blood,

16:02.162 --> 16:04.429
a violet in the youth
of primy nature,

16:05.865 --> 16:07.865
sweet, not lasting,

16:07.867 --> 16:09.634
forward, not permanent,

16:10.870 --> 16:13.738
the perfume and suppliance
of a minute, no more.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.306
- No more but so?

16:17.744 --> 16:18.843
- Think it no more.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.748
His greatness weighed,
his will is not his own.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.784
Then weigh what loss
your honor may sustain

16:26.786 --> 16:29.387
if with too credent
ear you list his songs

16:29.389 --> 16:31.789
or lose your heart,

16:33.059 --> 16:35.660
or your chaste treasure open
to his unmastered importunity.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.928
Fear it, Ophelia.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.262
Fear it, my dear sister,

16:39.766 --> 16:41.733
and keep you in the
rear of your affection,

16:41.735 --> 16:46.804
out of the shot and
danger of desire.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.407
(gentle instrumental music)

16:49.409 --> 16:51.142
- I shall the effect
of this good lesson

16:51.144 --> 16:52.877
keep as watchman to my heart,

16:54.781 --> 16:55.747
but good my brother, do not,

16:55.749 --> 16:57.882
as some ungracious pastors do,

16:57.884 --> 17:00.218
teach me the steep and
thorny way to heaven whiles,

17:00.220 --> 17:02.887
like a puffed and
reckless libertine,

17:02.889 --> 17:05.890
himself the primrose
path of dalliance treads.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.290
- Fear me not.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.893
(wood thudding)

17:08.895 --> 17:09.861
- Yet here, Laertes?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.999
There.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.467
My blessing with thee,

17:17.936 --> 17:22.839
and these few precepts in thy
memory look thou character.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.816
Give thy thoughts no tongue,

17:33.253 --> 17:35.853
nor any unproportioned
thought his act.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.657
Be thou familiar, but
by no means vulgar.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.660
Those friends thou hast
and their adoption tried,

17:42.662 --> 17:45.463
grapple them unto thy
soul with hoops of steel,

17:45.465 --> 17:48.332
but do not dull thy
palm with entertainment

17:48.334 --> 17:50.868
of each new hatched,
unfledged courage.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.206
Beware of entrance to a
quarrel, but being in,

17:56.276 --> 17:58.643
bear it that the opposed
may beware of thee.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.948
Costly thy habit as
thy purse can buy,

18:03.950 --> 18:05.850
but not expressed in fancy,

18:05.852 --> 18:07.985
rich, not gaudy,

18:07.987 --> 18:10.388
for the apparel oft
proclaims the man,

18:10.390 --> 18:13.091
and they in France of
the best rank and station

18:13.093 --> 18:15.626
are the most select and
generous, chief in that.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.663
This above all.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.367
To thine own self be true,

18:31.377 --> 18:35.980
and it must follow,
as the night, the day.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.552
Thou canst not then
be false to any man.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.834
Farewell.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.872
(gentle instrumental music)

19:00.874 --> 19:02.874
My blessing season this in thee.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.942
- Most humbly do I
take my leave, my lord.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.952
Farewell, Ophelia.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.088
Remember well what
I've said to you.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.356
- 'Tis in my memory locked,

19:18.358 --> 19:20.358
and you yourself shall
keep the key of it.

19:21.961 --> 19:22.960
- Farewell.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.968
(cloth thudding)

19:30.970 --> 19:32.703
(metal slamming)

19:32.705 --> 19:35.840
(car engine running)

19:43.650 --> 19:45.483
(bird cawing)

19:45.485 --> 19:48.019
(wind blowing)

19:50.957 --> 19:55.026
(dramatic instrumental music)

20:03.703 --> 20:06.437
(metal rattling)

20:08.007 --> 20:09.707
- The air bites shrewdly.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.275
It is very cold.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.278
- It is a nipping
and an eager air.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.782
- What hour now?

20:18.585 --> 20:20.184
- I think it lacks of 12:00?

20:20.186 --> 20:21.219
- No, it is struck.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.821
- Indeed?

20:23.823 --> 20:25.356
I heard it not.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.992
(bell ringing)

20:27.994 --> 20:29.393
Look, my lord.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.261
It comes.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.370
- Angels and ministers
of grace, defend us.

20:39.372 --> 20:43.241
(dramatic instrumental music)

20:45.912 --> 20:49.647
Be thou a spirit of
health or goblin damned,

20:52.151 --> 20:55.653
bring with thee airs from
heaven or blasts from hell,

20:55.655 --> 20:58.055
(wind blowing)

20:58.057 --> 21:01.926
be thy intents
wicked or charitable,

21:04.330 --> 21:06.364
thou comest in such
a questionable shape

21:06.366 --> 21:08.099
that I will speak to thee.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.101
I'll call thee Hamlet,

21:12.171 --> 21:13.004
King,

21:15.141 --> 21:16.107
Father.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.777
Royal Dane, oh, answer me.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.678
Say, why is this?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.580
Wherefore, what should we do?

21:22.582 --> 21:23.614
It will not speak.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.283
Then I will follow it.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.550
- Do not, my lord.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.885
- Why? What should be the fear?

21:27.887 --> 21:30.021
- What if it tempt you
toward the flood, my lord,

21:30.023 --> 21:31.289
or to the dreadful
summit of a cliff

21:31.291 --> 21:33.090
and there assume some
other horrible form

21:33.092 --> 21:34.358
which might deprive
your sovereignty

21:34.360 --> 21:36.360
of reason and draw
you into madness?

21:36.362 --> 21:37.228
Think on it.

21:39.899 --> 21:40.698
- Go on.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.033
I'll follow thee.

21:42.035 --> 21:43.634
- You shall not go, my lord.
- Hold off your hands.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.170
- [Horatio] Be ruled,
my lord, do not--
- Unhand me.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.938
By heaven, I'll make a
ghost of him that lets me.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.309
I say away.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.777
Go on.

21:52.779 --> 21:53.744
I'll follow thee.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.115
- [Horatio] He waxes
desperate with imagination.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.083
- [Marcellus] Let's follow.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.718
'Tis not fit thus to obey him.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.086
- [Horatio] Have after.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.722
- [Marcellus] Something is
rotten in the state of Denmark.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.057
(bell ringing)

22:06.059 --> 22:08.092
- [Horatio] Heaven
will direct it.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.060
(grass crunching)

22:09.062 --> 22:10.695
- Wither wilt thou lead me?

22:10.697 --> 22:11.929
Speak.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.030
I'll go no further.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.832
- [Ghost] Mark me.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.233
- I will.

22:16.235 --> 22:18.069
- [Ghost] My hour's almost
come when I to sulfurous

22:18.071 --> 22:20.938
and tormenting flames
must render up myself.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.139
- Speak.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.474
I am bound to hear.

22:23.476 --> 22:26.243
- [Ghost] So art thou to
revenge, when thou shalt hear.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.112
- [Hamlet] What?

22:28.114 --> 22:31.082
- [Ghost] I am thy
father's spirit,

22:31.084 --> 22:34.352
doomed for a certain
term to walk the night,

22:34.354 --> 22:36.721
and for the day confined
to fast in fires

22:36.723 --> 22:38.456
till the foul crimes
done in my days

22:38.458 --> 22:41.525
of nature are burnt
and purged away.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.328
List.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.097
List.

22:46.099 --> 22:46.964
Oh, list.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.736
If thou didst ever
thy dear father love--

22:51.738 --> 22:53.170
- God.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.840
- [Ghost] Revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.141
- Murder?

22:57.143 --> 22:58.509
- [Ghost] Murder most
foul, as in the best it is,

22:58.511 --> 23:01.879
but this most foul,
strange, and unnatural.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.547
- [Hamlet] Haste me
to know it that I,

23:03.549 --> 23:05.549
with wings as swift
as meditation or the
thoughts of love,

23:05.551 --> 23:07.118
may sweep to my revenge.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.586
- [Ghost] Now Hamlet, hear.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.255
'Tis given out that
sleeping in my orchard,

23:11.257 --> 23:12.790
a serpent stung me,

23:12.792 --> 23:16.127
so the whole ear of Denmark
is by a forged process

23:16.129 --> 23:19.063
of my death rankly abused,

23:19.065 --> 23:20.398
but know, thou noble youth,

23:20.400 --> 23:24.568
the serpent that did
sting thy father's life

23:24.570 --> 23:26.170
now wears his crown.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.939
- [Hamlet] Oh my
prophetic soul, my uncle.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.542
- [Ghost] But soft.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.979
Methinks I scent
the morning air.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.046
Brief let me be.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.816
Sleeping within my orchard,

23:38.818 --> 23:40.918
my custom always
of the afternoon,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.353
upon my secure hour,

23:42.355 --> 23:46.157
thy uncle stole, with juice
of cursed hebona in a vial,

23:46.159 --> 23:47.792
and in the porches of mine ears

23:47.794 --> 23:51.195
did pour the leprous distilment.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.831
Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's hand

23:53.833 --> 23:57.601
of life, of crown, of
queen at once dispatched.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.371
No reckoning made,
but sent to my account

24:00.373 --> 24:02.907
with all my
imperfections on my head.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.875
Oh, horrible.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.378
Oh, horrible.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.313
(bell ringing)

24:09.315 --> 24:10.481
Most horrible.

24:12.251 --> 24:15.519
If thou hast nature
in thee, bear it not.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.321
Let not the royal bed of Denmark

24:17.323 --> 24:20.591
be a couch for luxury
and damned incest.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.326
Adieu.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.495
Adieu.

24:26.399 --> 24:27.798
Adieu.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.567
(wind blowing)

24:29.569 --> 24:30.634
Remember me.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.037
(bird chirping)

24:33.039 --> 24:34.238
- [Marcellus] Lord Hamlet.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.340
(water flowing)

24:36.342 --> 24:37.208
- Hamlet.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.313
Lord Hamlet.

24:43.749 --> 24:46.050
- [Marcellus] My lord.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.985
- [Horatio] My lord.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.553
Heavens secure him.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.657
- [Marcellus] How
doth my noble lord?

24:53.659 --> 24:55.025
- What news, my lord?

24:55.027 --> 24:56.093
- Wonderful.

24:57.463 --> 24:59.296
- Well, good my lord, tell it.
- No, you will reveal it.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.397
- [Horatio] Not I,
my lord, by heaven.

25:00.399 --> 25:01.799
- [Marcellus] Nor I, my lord.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.567
- But you'll be secret?

25:03.569 --> 25:05.169
- Aye, by heaven, my lord.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.670
- There's never a villain
dwelling in all Denmark,

25:06.672 --> 25:07.972
but he's an arrant knave.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.273
- There needs no ghost, my lord,

25:09.275 --> 25:10.674
come from the grave
to tell us this.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.309
- Why, right.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.711
You are in the right,

25:13.713 --> 25:15.980
and so I hold it fit that
we shake hands and part,

25:15.982 --> 25:18.082
you as your business and
desire shall point you,

25:18.084 --> 25:19.783
for every man hath
business and desire,

25:19.785 --> 25:22.319
such as it is, and
for my own poor part,

25:23.322 --> 25:24.855
I will go pray.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.024
- These are but wild and
whirling words, my lord.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.659
- [Hamlet] I'm sorry they
offend you, heartily.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.593
Yes, faith, heartily.

25:29.595 --> 25:30.861
- There's no offense, my lord.

25:30.863 --> 25:34.331
- Yes, by Saint Patrick,
but there is, Horatio,

25:34.333 --> 25:35.699
and much offense too,

25:35.701 --> 25:39.670
(gentle instrumental music)

25:39.672 --> 25:42.339
and now, good friends,
as you are friends,

25:43.843 --> 25:47.011
scholars, and soldiers,
give me one poor request.

25:47.013 --> 25:47.912
- What is it, my lord?

25:47.914 --> 25:48.779
We will.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.750
- Never make known what
you have seen tonight.

25:52.752 --> 25:53.717
- My lord, we will not.

25:53.719 --> 25:54.919
- Nay, but swear it.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.489
- [Horatio] Oh, day and night,

25:58.491 --> 26:00.357
but this is wondrous strange.

26:00.359 --> 26:04.194
- And therefore, as a
stranger give it welcome.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.131
There are more things
in heaven and earth,

26:07.133 --> 26:10.167
Horatio, than are dreamt
of in your philosophy.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.837
(gentle instrumental music)

26:21.314 --> 26:22.980
(wind blowing)

26:22.982 --> 26:26.183
(car engine running)

26:35.328 --> 26:39.263
(gentle instrumental music)

26:39.265 --> 26:42.132
(grass crunching)

26:42.969 --> 26:45.636
(wood thudding)

26:52.612 --> 26:54.878
(panting)

26:58.117 --> 26:58.916
- How now, Ophelia?

26:58.918 --> 27:00.150
What's the matter?

27:00.152 --> 27:02.486
- Alas, my lord, I have
been so affrighted.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.688
- With what, in the name of God?

27:04.690 --> 27:06.590
- As I was sewing in my
chamber, Lord Hamlet,

27:06.592 --> 27:08.359
with his doublet all unbraced,

27:08.361 --> 27:10.494
pale as his shirt, his
knees knocking each other,

27:10.496 --> 27:12.529
and with a look so
piteous in purport

27:12.531 --> 27:13.731
as if he had been
loosed out of hell

27:13.733 --> 27:17.401
to speak of horrors,
he comes before me.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.003
- Mad for thy love?

27:19.005 --> 27:22.239
- My lord, I do not know,
but truly I do fear it.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.107
- What said he?

27:24.644 --> 27:27.411
- [Ophelia] He took me by
the wrist and held me hard.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.179
Then goes he to the
length of all his arm,

27:29.181 --> 27:32.016
and with his other hand
thus o'er his brow,

27:32.018 --> 27:36.020
he falls to such perusal of
my face as he would draw it.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.221
Long stayed he so.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.758
At last, a little
shaking of mine arm,

27:40.760 --> 27:44.361
and thrice his head
thus waving up and down,

27:44.363 --> 27:48.165
he raised a sigh so
piteous and profound

27:48.167 --> 27:49.933
as it did seem to
shatter all his bulk

27:49.935 --> 27:50.868
and end his being.

27:51.637 --> 27:55.506
(gentle instrumental music)

27:56.442 --> 27:57.875
- Come, go with me.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.210
I will go seek the King.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.615
This is the very ecstasy of love

28:04.617 --> 28:06.550
whose violent property
fordoes itself

28:06.552 --> 28:08.952
and leads the will to
desperate undertakings

28:08.954 --> 28:10.487
as oft as any
passions under heaven

28:10.489 --> 28:12.489
that does afflict our natures.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.557
I'm sorry.

28:18.064 --> 28:21.432
What, have you given him
any hard words of late?

28:21.434 --> 28:23.467
- No, my lord, but
as you did command

28:23.469 --> 28:24.468
I did repel his letters

28:24.470 --> 28:26.070
and denied his access to me.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.505
- That hath made him mad.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.477
Come.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.845
Go we to the King.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.413
This must be known,

28:36.415 --> 28:38.816
which being kept close might
move more grief to hide

28:38.818 --> 28:40.317
than hate to utter love.

28:43.522 --> 28:44.588
Come.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.093
(birds cawing)

28:50.463 --> 28:54.131
(gentle instrumental music)

28:55.534 --> 28:58.535
(metal thudding)

29:05.311 --> 29:07.478
- Welcome, dear Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern.

29:09.715 --> 29:12.015
Moreover that we much
did long to see you,

29:12.017 --> 29:15.052
the need we have to use you
did provoke our hasty sending.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.086
(liquid pouring)

29:16.088 --> 29:17.421
Something, have you heard,

29:17.423 --> 29:19.890
of Hamlet's
transformation, so call it?

29:19.892 --> 29:22.159
Sith nor the exterior
nor the inward man

29:22.161 --> 29:24.228
resembles that it was.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.130
What it should be, more
than his father's death,

29:26.132 --> 29:27.631
that thus has put him so much

29:27.633 --> 29:28.932
from the understanding
of himself,

29:28.934 --> 29:29.967
I cannot dream of.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.470
I entreat you both that,

29:33.472 --> 29:35.906
being of so young days
brought up with him,

29:35.908 --> 29:38.475
and sith so neighbored
to his youth and havior,

29:38.477 --> 29:40.577
that you vouchsafe
your rest here

29:40.579 --> 29:42.546
in our court some little time,

29:42.548 --> 29:43.514
so by your companies

29:43.516 --> 29:44.882
to draw him on to pleasures

29:44.884 --> 29:47.684
and to gather so much as
from occasion you may glean

29:47.686 --> 29:49.987
whether aught to us
unknown afflicts him thus

29:49.989 --> 29:51.755
that opened lies
within our remedy.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.690
- Good gentlemen, he
hath much talked of you,

29:53.692 --> 29:56.527
and sure I am two men
there is not living

29:56.529 --> 29:58.328
to whom he more adheres.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.663
- Both your Majesties might,

29:59.665 --> 30:01.732
by the sovereign
power you have of us,

30:01.734 --> 30:03.066
put your dread pleasures

30:03.068 --> 30:05.369
more into command
than to entreaty.

30:05.371 --> 30:08.672
- But we both obey and
here give up ourselves

30:08.674 --> 30:11.074
in the full bent to
lay our service freely

30:11.076 --> 30:13.610
at your feet to be commanded.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.813
- Thanks, Rosencrantz
and gentle Guildenstern.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.615
- Thanks, Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz,

30:18.617 --> 30:20.350
and I beseech you instantly

30:20.352 --> 30:22.686
to visit my too
much changed son.

30:24.890 --> 30:27.558
(whispering)

30:27.560 --> 30:29.193
- He tells me, my dear Gertrude,

30:29.195 --> 30:30.727
he hath found the
head and source

30:30.729 --> 30:33.030
of all your son's distemper.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.566
- I doubt it is no
other than the main,

30:35.568 --> 30:38.135
his father's death and
our o'er hasty marriage.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.603
- Well,

30:39.605 --> 30:41.205
(cutlery rattling)

30:41.207 --> 30:42.272
we shall sift him.

30:47.446 --> 30:52.516
- My liege and
madam, to expostulate

30:54.787 --> 30:59.823
what majesty should
be, what duty is,

31:00.993 --> 31:04.595
why day is day, night,
night, and time is time

31:04.597 --> 31:09.066
were nothing but to waste
night, day, and time.

31:11.237 --> 31:16.206
Therefore, since brevity
is the soul of wit

31:17.643 --> 31:20.777
and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes,

31:20.779 --> 31:22.246
I will be brief.

31:23.148 --> 31:26.750
Your noble son is mad.

31:27.686 --> 31:32.189
Mad call I it, for to
define true madness,

31:32.191 --> 31:35.492
what is it but to be
nothing else but mad?

31:36.662 --> 31:37.794
But let that go.

31:37.796 --> 31:38.896
- More matter with less art.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.998
- Madam, I swear I
use no art at all.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.065
That he's mad, 'tis true.

31:42.067 --> 31:42.866
'Tis true.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.434
'Tis pity,

31:44.436 --> 31:47.304
and pity 'tis 'tis
true, a foolish figure,

31:47.306 --> 31:49.539
but farewell it, for
I will use no art.

31:52.878 --> 31:53.844
I have a daughter,

31:54.647 --> 31:57.314
have while she is mine,

31:57.316 --> 31:59.116
who in her duty and
obedience, mark,

31:59.118 --> 32:01.885
hath given me this.

32:01.887 --> 32:06.657
Now gather and surmise.

32:09.695 --> 32:13.263
"To the celestial
and my soul's idol,

32:13.265 --> 32:16.867
"the most beautified Ophelia,"
that's an ill phrase,

32:19.638 --> 32:20.604
a vile phrase.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.506
Beautified is a vile phrase,

32:22.508 --> 32:23.674
but you shall hear.

32:24.677 --> 32:26.810
"In her excellent white bosom--"

32:26.812 --> 32:28.912
- Came this from Hamlet to her?

32:28.914 --> 32:30.147
- Good madam, stay awhile.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.682
I will be faithful.

32:34.820 --> 32:38.322
"Doubt thou the stars are fire.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.824
"Doubt that the sun doth move.

32:42.094 --> 32:46.730
"Doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.973
"Oh dear Ophelia, I am
ill at these numbers.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.375
"I have not art to
reckon my groans,

32:58.377 --> 33:01.778
"but that I love thee best,

33:02.748 --> 33:05.916
"oh, most best,

33:05.918 --> 33:07.718
"believe it.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.552
"Adieu.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.722
"Thine evermore, most dear lady,

33:11.724 --> 33:16.059
"whilst this machine
is to him, Hamlet."

33:18.497 --> 33:20.931
- [Claudius] But how hath
she received his love?

33:20.933 --> 33:22.366
- What do you think of me?

33:23.369 --> 33:25.902
- As of a man faithful
and honorable.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.137
- I would fain prove so.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.339
- Do you think 'tis this?

33:29.341 --> 33:33.176
- Take this from this,
if this be otherwise.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.512
If circumstances lead me,

33:35.514 --> 33:36.780
I will find where truth is hid,

33:36.782 --> 33:39.016
though it were hid
indeed within the center.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.517
- How may we try it further?

33:40.519 --> 33:41.785
- You know sometimes he walks

33:41.787 --> 33:43.820
four hours together
here in the lobby?

33:43.822 --> 33:45.489
- So he does indeed.

33:45.491 --> 33:48.825
- At such a time, I'll
loose my daughter to him.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.895
Be you and I behind
an arras then,

33:51.897 --> 33:52.829
mark the encounter.

33:52.831 --> 33:53.930
If he love her not

33:53.932 --> 33:56.566
and be not from his
reason fallen thereon,

33:56.568 --> 33:58.035
let me be no
assistant for a state,

33:58.037 --> 33:59.870
but keep a farm and carters.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.440
- We will try it.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.976
(metal clattering)

34:05.978 --> 34:07.611
(bird cawing)

34:07.613 --> 34:10.614
(gravel crunching)

34:13.585 --> 34:16.353
(rope whirring)

34:16.355 --> 34:18.922
(wind blowing)

34:23.862 --> 34:25.594
- [Polonius] How does
my good Lord Hamlet?

34:25.597 --> 34:26.830
- Well, God a mercy.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.667
- What do you read, my lord?

34:30.668 --> 34:31.668
- Words.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.072
Words.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.208
Words.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.945
- What is the matter, my lord?

34:41.947 --> 34:43.013
- Between who?

34:43.014 --> 34:45.482
- I mean the matter
that you read, my lord.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.851
- Slanders, sir,
for yourself, sir,

34:47.853 --> 34:49.252
shall grow old as I am,

34:49.254 --> 34:52.456
if like a crab, you
could go backward.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.891
- Will you walk out
of the air, my lord?

34:54.893 --> 34:56.393
- Into my grave?

34:56.395 --> 34:58.095
- Indeed, that's out of the air.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.231
My lord, I will take
my leave of you.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.165
- You cannot, sir,

35:02.167 --> 35:03.700
take from me anything

35:03.702 --> 35:06.837
that I'll more willingly
part withal, except my life,

35:06.839 --> 35:09.106
except my life, except my life.

35:09.108 --> 35:10.474
- Fare you well, my lord.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.243
- [Hamlet] Tedious old fools.

35:14.012 --> 35:17.013
(gravel crunching)

35:17.015 --> 35:19.182
- You go to seek
the Lord Hamlet?

35:19.184 --> 35:20.383
There he is.

35:20.385 --> 35:22.919
(birds cawing)

35:22.921 --> 35:24.855
- My honored lord.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.389
- My most dear lord.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.191
- My excellent good friends.

35:28.193 --> 35:30.827
How dost thou,
Guildenstern, huh?

35:30.829 --> 35:32.395
Rosencrantz.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.131
Good lads, how do you both?

35:34.133 --> 35:36.466
- As the indifferent
children of the earth.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.035
- Happy in that we
are not overhappy.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.538
On Fortune's cap, we
are not the very button.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.039
- Nor the soles of her shoe?

35:43.041 --> 35:44.241
- Neither, my lord.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.809
- Then you live about her waist

35:45.811 --> 35:47.677
or in the middle of her favors?

35:47.679 --> 35:50.480
- Faith, her privates, we.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.749
- In the secret parts
of Fortune, huh?

35:52.751 --> 35:53.683
(laughing)

35:53.685 --> 35:56.953
Most true, she is a strumpet.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.421
What news?

35:58.423 --> 36:01.324
- None, my lord, but that
the world's grown honest.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.026
- Then is doomsday near,

36:03.028 --> 36:04.060
but your news is not true.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.729
Let me question
more in particular.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.098
What have you, my good friends,

36:08.100 --> 36:10.066
deserved at the hands of Fortune

36:10.068 --> 36:12.435
that she sends you
to prison hither?

36:12.437 --> 36:13.803
- Prison, my lord?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.739
- Denmark's a prison.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.073
- Then is the world one.

36:17.075 --> 36:18.642
- A goodly one, in which
there are many confines,

36:18.644 --> 36:19.643
wards, and dungeons,

36:19.645 --> 36:21.711
Denmark being one of the worst.

36:21.713 --> 36:22.846
- We think not so, my lord.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.181
- Why then 'tis none to you,

36:24.183 --> 36:25.715
for there's nothing
either good or bad,

36:25.717 --> 36:28.051
but thinking makes it so.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.086
To me, it is a prison.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.189
- Why, then, your
ambition makes it one.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.558
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.194
- Oh God, I could be
bounded in a nutshell

36:37.196 --> 36:39.563
and count myself king
of infinite space

36:39.565 --> 36:41.765
were it not that
I have bad dreams.

36:41.767 --> 36:44.801
- Which dreams
indeed are ambition,

36:44.803 --> 36:47.003
for the very substance
of the ambitious

36:47.005 --> 36:49.639
is merely the shadow of a dream.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.375
- A dream itself
is but a shadow.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.078
- Truly, and I hold
ambition of so airy

36:55.080 --> 37:00.150
and light a quality that it
is but a shadow's shadow.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.754
- Then are our beggars bodies

37:04.756 --> 37:07.090
and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes

37:07.092 --> 37:10.560
the beggars' shadows? (laughing)

37:10.562 --> 37:11.494
Shall we to the court?

37:11.496 --> 37:13.029
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.599
- [Both] We will wait upon you.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.133
(gentle instrumental music)

37:17.135 --> 37:18.335
- No such matter.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.003
I will not sort you with
the rest of my servants,

37:20.005 --> 37:21.905
for to speak to you
like an honest man,

37:21.907 --> 37:23.974
I am most dreadfully attended,

37:23.976 --> 37:26.643
but in the beaten
way of friendship,

37:26.645 --> 37:28.078
what make you at Elsinore?

37:30.048 --> 37:32.415
- To visit you, my
lord, no other occasion.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.718
- Beggar that I am, I
am even poor in thanks,

37:34.720 --> 37:37.153
but I thank you, and
sure, dear friends,

37:37.155 --> 37:39.556
my thanks are too
dear a halfpenny.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.091
Were you not sent for?

37:41.927 --> 37:43.260
Is it your own inclining?

37:43.262 --> 37:45.428
Is it a free visitation?

37:45.430 --> 37:46.730
Come, come, deal justly with me.

37:46.732 --> 37:47.530
Come, come.

37:47.532 --> 37:48.431
Nay, speak.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.166
- What should we say, my lord?

37:50.168 --> 37:52.269
- Anything but to the purpose.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.570
You were sent for,

37:53.572 --> 37:55.538
and there is a kind of
confession in your looks

37:55.540 --> 37:58.241
which your modesties have
not craft enough to color.

37:58.243 --> 38:01.177
I know the good King and
Queen have sent for you.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.146
- To what end, my lord?

38:03.148 --> 38:05.548
- That you must teach me,

38:05.550 --> 38:07.484
but let me conjure
you by the rights

38:07.486 --> 38:10.353
of our fellowship, by the
consonancy of our youth,

38:10.355 --> 38:13.189
by the obligation of
our ever preserved love,

38:13.191 --> 38:14.224
and by what more dear

38:14.226 --> 38:16.393
a better proposer can
charge you withal.

38:16.395 --> 38:19.195
Be even and direct with me

38:19.197 --> 38:21.598
whether you were sent for or no.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.799
- What say you?

38:22.801 --> 38:24.567
- Nay, then, I
have an eye of you.

38:24.569 --> 38:26.870
If you love me, hold not off.

38:26.872 --> 38:28.872
- My lord, we were sent for.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.710
- I will tell you why.

38:35.113 --> 38:38.048
So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery,

38:38.050 --> 38:40.850
and your secrecy to the King
and Queen molt no feather.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.487
I have of late,

38:45.590 --> 38:48.191
but wherefore I know
not, lost all my mirth,

38:49.995 --> 38:52.429
forgone all custom of exercise,

38:52.431 --> 38:55.231
and indeed it goes so
heavily with my disposition

38:55.233 --> 38:57.100
that this goodly
frame, the Earth,

38:59.071 --> 39:00.704
seems to me a
sterile promontory.

39:02.240 --> 39:06.676
This most excellent
canopy, the air, look you.

39:07.612 --> 39:10.747
This brave
o'erhanging firmament,

39:12.250 --> 39:15.652
this majestical roof,
fretted with golden fire,

39:15.654 --> 39:18.254
why it appears no
other thing to me

39:18.256 --> 39:21.725
but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapors.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.561
(gentle instrumental music)

39:24.563 --> 39:26.229
What a piece of work is a man.

39:27.499 --> 39:32.102
How noble in reason, how
infinite in faculties.

39:32.104 --> 39:33.636
In form and moving,

39:33.638 --> 39:36.272
how express and admirable.

39:36.274 --> 39:39.142
In action, how like an angel.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.910
In apprehension, how like a god,

39:40.912 --> 39:44.748
the beauty of the world,
the paragon of animals,

39:48.120 --> 39:48.985
and yet,

39:52.557 --> 39:57.460
to me, what is this
quintessence of dust?

40:00.799 --> 40:01.865
Man delights not me.

40:03.301 --> 40:05.468
(laughing)

40:07.773 --> 40:09.205
No, nor woman neither,

40:09.207 --> 40:12.108
though by your smiling
you seem to say so.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.677
- My lord, there were no
such stuff in my thoughts.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.578
- Why did you laugh then

40:15.580 --> 40:17.213
when I said man delights not me?

40:19.551 --> 40:22.318
- To think, my lord, if
you delight not in man,

40:22.320 --> 40:23.987
what lenten entertainment

40:23.989 --> 40:26.156
the players shall
receive from you.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.524
We coted them on the way,

40:27.526 --> 40:29.626
and hither are they coming
to offer you service.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.995
(wood rattling)

40:31.997 --> 40:33.696
- He that plays the
king shall be welcome.

40:33.698 --> 40:35.298
What players are they?

40:35.300 --> 40:37.333
- Even those you were wont
to take such delight in,

40:37.335 --> 40:39.669
the tragedians of the city.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.207
- [Hamlet] This blood,
there is something in
this more than natural,

40:44.209 --> 40:46.276
if philosophy could find it out.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.779
You are welcome,

40:49.781 --> 40:53.249
but my uncle father and
aunt mother are deceived.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.918
- In what, my dear lord?

40:54.920 --> 40:57.387
- I am but mad north, northwest.

40:57.389 --> 40:58.822
When the wind is southerly,

40:59.825 --> 41:01.524
I know a hawk from a handsaw.

41:03.628 --> 41:07.263
(gentle instrumental music)

41:20.345 --> 41:21.344
(metal rattling)

41:21.346 --> 41:22.345
(liquid sloshing)

41:22.347 --> 41:23.947
Oh, my old friend,

41:23.949 --> 41:25.148
we'll have a speech straight.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.416
Come, give us a taste
of your quality.

41:26.418 --> 41:27.851
Come, a passionate speech.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.219
- What speech, my good lord?

41:29.221 --> 41:31.421
- I heard thee speak
me a speech once,

41:31.423 --> 41:32.355
but it was never acted,

41:32.357 --> 41:34.390
or if it was, not above once,

41:34.392 --> 41:37.427
for the play, I remember,
pleased not the million.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.462
'Twas caviary to the
general, but it was,

41:39.464 --> 41:41.798
as I received it, and
others whose judgments

41:41.800 --> 41:43.867
in such matters cried
at the top of mine,

41:43.869 --> 41:45.034
an excellent play.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.370
One speech in it
I chiefly loved.

41:47.372 --> 41:49.105
'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido,

41:49.107 --> 41:50.273
and thereabout of it especially

41:50.275 --> 41:52.408
when he speaks of
Priam's slaughter.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.644
If it live in your memory,
begin at this line.

41:56.314 --> 41:57.447
Oh, let me see.

41:57.449 --> 41:58.281
Let me see.

41:59.417 --> 42:02.318
The rugged Pyrrhus, like
the Hyrcanian beast,

42:03.722 --> 42:04.554
'tis not so.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.924
It begins with Pyrrhus.

42:07.926 --> 42:11.294
The hellish Pyrrhus, old
grandsire Priam seeks,

42:12.097 --> 42:12.896
so proceed you.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.735
- Anon he finds him,

42:20.305 --> 42:22.539
striking too short at Greeks.

42:22.541 --> 42:25.341
His antique sword,
rebellious to his arm,

42:25.343 --> 42:27.911
lies where it falls,
repugnant to command.

42:28.914 --> 42:31.447
Unequal matched,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives,

42:31.449 --> 42:33.116
in rage strikes wide,

42:33.118 --> 42:34.350
but with the whiff and wind

42:34.352 --> 42:37.153
of his fell sword the
unnerved father falls.

42:38.356 --> 42:42.458
Then senseless Ilium,
seeming to feel his blow,

42:42.460 --> 42:45.028
from flaming top
stoops to his base,

42:45.030 --> 42:47.964
and with a hideous crash
takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear,

42:47.966 --> 42:49.332
for lo, his sword,

42:49.334 --> 42:51.634
which was declining on the
milky head of reverend Priam,

42:51.636 --> 42:53.336
seemed in the air to stick.

42:54.539 --> 42:57.941
Anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region,

42:57.943 --> 43:00.276
so after Pyrrhus' pause,

43:00.278 --> 43:02.745
aroused vengeance
sets him new a-work,

43:02.747 --> 43:04.781
and never did the
Cyclops' hammers fall

43:04.783 --> 43:07.350
on Mars's armor, forged
for proof eterne,

43:07.352 --> 43:09.319
with less remorse than
Pyrrhus' bleeding sword

43:09.321 --> 43:11.454
now falls on Priam.

43:11.456 --> 43:14.157
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune.

43:14.159 --> 43:17.126
All you gods in general
synod take away her power.

43:17.128 --> 43:19.395
Break all the spokes and
fellies from her wheel,

43:19.397 --> 43:20.697
and bowl the round
nave down the hill

43:20.699 --> 43:24.734
of heaven as low
as to the fiends.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.402
- [Polonius] This is too long.

43:28.306 --> 43:31.007
- It shall to the
barber's with your beard.

43:31.009 --> 43:32.208
Prithee say on.

43:32.210 --> 43:33.977
He's for a jig or a tale
of bawdry, or he sleeps.

43:33.979 --> 43:34.777
Say on.

43:34.779 --> 43:35.845
Come to Hecuba.

43:37.082 --> 43:41.951
- But who, ah, woe, had
seen the mobled queen.

43:41.953 --> 43:42.752
- The mobled queen?

43:42.754 --> 43:43.620
- That's good.

43:46.825 --> 43:49.225
Mobled queen is good.

43:50.428 --> 43:52.228
- Run barefoot up and down,

43:52.230 --> 43:54.297
threatening the flames
with bisson rheum,

43:54.299 --> 43:55.398
a clout upon that head

43:55.400 --> 43:57.567
where late the diadem
stood, and for a robe,

43:57.569 --> 44:00.203
about her lank and
all o'erteemed loins,

44:00.205 --> 44:03.039
a blanket, in the alarm
of fear caught up.

44:04.209 --> 44:06.409
Who this had seen, with
tongue in venom steeped,

44:06.411 --> 44:09.545
against Fortune's state would
treason have pronounced,

44:09.547 --> 44:12.315
but if the gods themselves
did see her then,

44:12.317 --> 44:15.018
when she saw Pyrrhus
make malicious sport

44:15.020 --> 44:17.620
in mincing with his sword
her husband's limbs,

44:17.622 --> 44:20.256
the instant burst of
clamor that she made,

44:20.258 --> 44:23.559
unless things mortal
move them not at all,

44:23.561 --> 44:26.162
would have made milch
the burning eyes

44:26.164 --> 44:29.065
of heaven and
passion in the gods.

44:32.937 --> 44:35.138
(crying)

44:35.140 --> 44:36.572
(gentle instrumental music)

44:36.574 --> 44:38.107
- Prithee, no more.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.443
- 'Tis well.

44:40.445 --> 44:43.279
I'll have thee speak out
the rest of this soon.

44:43.281 --> 44:45.615
Good my lord, will you see
the players well bestowed?

44:48.286 --> 44:50.486
Dost thou hear me, old friend?

44:50.488 --> 44:52.388
Can you play The
Murder of Gonzago?

44:52.390 --> 44:54.023
- Aye, my lord.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.858
- We'll have it tomorrow night.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.493
You could, for a
need, study a speech

44:57.495 --> 44:58.861
of some dozen or 16 lines,

44:58.863 --> 45:00.596
which I would set
down and insert in it,

45:00.598 --> 45:01.397
could you not?

45:01.399 --> 45:02.498
- Aye, my lord.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.633
- Very well.

45:03.635 --> 45:05.768
Follow that lord, and
look you mock him not.

45:05.770 --> 45:08.438
(wood thudding)

45:16.014 --> 45:17.046
Now I am alone.

45:21.086 --> 45:24.287
Oh, what a rogue and
peasant slave am I.

45:27.625 --> 45:30.727
Is not this monstrous
that this player here,

45:30.729 --> 45:34.530
but in a fiction, in
a dream of passion,

45:34.532 --> 45:36.632
could force his soul
so to his own conceit

45:36.634 --> 45:39.135
that from her working
all his visage wanned.

45:40.472 --> 45:43.239
Tears in his eyes,
distraction in his aspect,

45:43.241 --> 45:46.209
a broken voice, and his
whole function suiting

45:46.211 --> 45:49.879
with forms to his conceit,
and all for nothing,

45:49.881 --> 45:51.447
for Hecuba.

45:51.449 --> 45:52.482
What's Hecuba to him,

45:52.484 --> 45:54.717
or he to Hecuba that
he should weep for her?

45:54.719 --> 45:56.886
What would he do
had he the motive

45:56.888 --> 45:59.455
and the cue for
passion that I have?

45:59.457 --> 46:01.657
He would drown the
stage with tears

46:01.659 --> 46:05.328
and cleave the general
ear with horrid speech,

46:05.330 --> 46:07.563
make mad the guilty
and appall the free,

46:07.565 --> 46:10.566
confound the ignorant
and amaze indeed

46:10.568 --> 46:13.569
the very faculties
of eyes and ears,

46:13.571 --> 46:18.574
yet I, a dull and
muddy mettled rascal,

46:19.477 --> 46:21.577
peak like John a dreams,

46:21.579 --> 46:24.247
unpregnant of my cause
and can say nothing.

46:28.253 --> 46:29.318
Am I a coward?

46:31.723 --> 46:32.922
Who calls me villain,

46:35.293 --> 46:37.193
breaks my pate across,

46:38.296 --> 46:41.164
plucks off my beard and
blows it in my face,

46:41.166 --> 46:43.166
tweaks me by the nose,

46:43.168 --> 46:46.068
gives me the lie of the throat
as deep as to the lungs?

46:46.070 --> 46:47.770
Who does me this, huh?

46:52.610 --> 46:54.243
Zounds, I should take it,

46:55.513 --> 46:57.747
for it cannot be but
I am pigeon livered

46:57.749 --> 46:59.615
and lack gall to make
oppression bitter,

46:59.617 --> 47:01.584
or ere this I should have fatted

47:01.586 --> 47:04.554
all the region kites
with this slave's offal.

47:04.556 --> 47:07.023
Bloody, bawdy villain,

47:07.025 --> 47:10.426
remorseless,
treacherous, lecherous,

47:10.428 --> 47:12.995
kindless villain, oh vengeance.

47:13.832 --> 47:14.764
(cutlery rattling)

47:14.766 --> 47:16.032
(gentle instrumental music)

47:16.034 --> 47:18.601
I have heard that
guilty creatures

47:18.603 --> 47:20.102
sitting at a play have,

47:20.104 --> 47:22.104
by the very cunning
of the scene,

47:22.106 --> 47:25.007
been struck so to the
soul that presently

47:25.009 --> 47:27.076
they have proclaimed
their malefactions.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.645
I'll have these
players play something

47:29.647 --> 47:32.648
like the murder of my
father before mine uncle.

47:32.650 --> 47:33.649
I'll observe his looks.

47:33.651 --> 47:35.384
I'll tent him to the quick.

47:35.386 --> 47:38.521
If he do blench,
I know my course.

47:38.523 --> 47:39.755
The play's the thing

47:39.757 --> 47:42.225
wherein I'll catch the
conscience of the King.

47:43.561 --> 47:44.594
(lighter clicking)

47:44.596 --> 47:47.263
(bird cawing)

47:53.605 --> 47:56.472
(wood creaking)

48:01.412 --> 48:02.578
(gravel crunching)

48:02.580 --> 48:03.446
- Ophelia,

48:04.949 --> 48:06.549
walk you here.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.018
Gracious, so please you,
we will bestow ourselves.

48:10.955 --> 48:13.623
Read on this book that
show of such an exercise

48:13.625 --> 48:14.790
may color your loneliness.

48:14.792 --> 48:16.559
(wood rattling)

48:16.561 --> 48:18.227
I hear him coming.

48:18.229 --> 48:19.295
Let's withdraw, my lord.

48:19.297 --> 48:21.964
(frog croaking)

48:23.501 --> 48:24.400
(wood thudding)

48:24.402 --> 48:27.069
(wood rattling)

48:30.642 --> 48:33.643
(rocks scraping)

48:38.049 --> 48:38.915
- To be

48:42.720 --> 48:43.920
or not to be,

48:46.324 --> 48:47.490
that is the question.

48:49.661 --> 48:52.795
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

48:52.797 --> 48:57.066
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

48:58.736 --> 49:02.605
or to take arms against
a sea of troubles

49:02.607 --> 49:05.675
and, by opposing, end them.

49:05.677 --> 49:09.011
(gentle instrumental music)

49:09.013 --> 49:09.879
To die,

49:12.650 --> 49:15.217
to sleep no more,

49:17.221 --> 49:19.588
and by a sleep to say
we end the heartache

49:20.658 --> 49:23.726
and the thousand natural shocks

49:23.728 --> 49:24.927
that flesh is heir to,

49:26.864 --> 49:28.431
'tis a consummation

49:31.669 --> 49:33.970
devoutly to be wished.

49:33.972 --> 49:35.404
To die, to sleep,

49:39.577 --> 49:40.977
to sleep, perchance to dream,

49:42.880 --> 49:43.879
(sticks cracking)

49:43.881 --> 49:45.481
aye, there's the rub,

49:45.483 --> 49:47.383
for in that sleep of death,

49:48.319 --> 49:49.585
what dreams may come

49:49.587 --> 49:51.620
when we have shuffled
off this mortal coil

49:52.924 --> 49:55.291
must give us pause.

49:55.293 --> 49:59.862
There's the respect that makes
calamity of so long life,

49:59.864 --> 50:02.865
for who would bear the
whips and scorns of time,

50:04.302 --> 50:06.869
th'oppressor's wrong, the
proud man's contumely,

50:06.871 --> 50:09.805
the pangs of despised love,

50:11.809 --> 50:12.742
the law's delay,

50:13.678 --> 50:14.810
th'insolence of office,

50:16.214 --> 50:18.080
and the spurns
that patient merit

50:19.150 --> 50:20.716
of the unworthy
takes when he himself

50:20.718 --> 50:23.853
might his quietus
make with bare bodkin?

50:26.357 --> 50:27.556
Who would fardels bear

50:28.926 --> 50:33.996
to grunt and sweat
under a weary life,

50:35.166 --> 50:37.700
but that the dread of
something after death?

50:39.037 --> 50:41.003
The undiscovered country,

50:41.005 --> 50:42.905
from whose bourn no
traveler returns,

50:44.642 --> 50:47.510
puzzles the will and
makes us rather bear

50:47.512 --> 50:48.611
those ills we have

50:49.847 --> 50:52.615
than fly to those
we know not of.

50:53.751 --> 50:56.519
Thus conscience does
make cowards of us all,

50:56.521 --> 51:00.656
and thus the native
hue of resolution

51:00.658 --> 51:02.858
is sicklied o'er with
the pale cast of thought

51:03.961 --> 51:05.761
and enterprises of
great pitch and moment.

51:05.763 --> 51:06.996
With this regard their currents

51:06.998 --> 51:09.732
turn awry and lose
the name of action.

51:12.470 --> 51:13.269
(match striking)

51:13.271 --> 51:14.470
(humming)

51:14.472 --> 51:16.472
(birds cawing)

51:16.474 --> 51:18.874
Soft you now, fair Ophelia.

51:21.746 --> 51:22.545
Nymph.

51:22.547 --> 51:24.814
(gasping)

51:27.852 --> 51:31.020
In thy orisons be all
my sins remembered.

51:31.022 --> 51:31.854
- Good my lord,

51:34.792 --> 51:36.859
how does your honor
for this many a day?

51:39.831 --> 51:41.864
- I humbly thank you, well.

51:44.802 --> 51:46.435
- My lord, I have
remembrances of yours

51:46.437 --> 51:48.304
I have longed long to redeliver.

51:48.306 --> 51:49.772
I pray you now receive them.

51:50.908 --> 51:53.676
(wind blowing)

51:56.013 --> 51:57.446
(metal thudding)

51:57.448 --> 52:00.182
(paper rustling)

52:03.888 --> 52:06.655
- [Hamlet] No, not I.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.190
I never gave you aught.

52:10.328 --> 52:12.795
- My honored lord, you
know right well you did,

52:13.998 --> 52:15.498
and with them words
of so sweet breath

52:15.500 --> 52:17.600
composed as made the
things more rich.

52:19.704 --> 52:21.103
Their perfume lost,
take these again,

52:21.105 --> 52:22.338
for to the noble mind

52:22.340 --> 52:24.807
rich gifts wax poor when
givers prove unkind.

52:24.809 --> 52:25.608
There, my lord.

52:25.610 --> 52:27.877
(laughing)

52:30.348 --> 52:32.148
- Are you honest?

52:32.150 --> 52:32.948
- [Ophelia] My lord?

52:32.950 --> 52:34.150
- Are you fair?

52:34.152 --> 52:35.217
- [Ophelia] What
means, your lordship?

52:35.219 --> 52:37.753
- That if you be
honest and fair,

52:37.755 --> 52:40.356
your honesty should admit
no discourse to your beauty.

52:40.358 --> 52:41.657
- [Ophelia] Could
beauty, my lord,

52:41.659 --> 52:43.259
have better commerce
than with honesty?

52:43.261 --> 52:45.928
- Aye, truly, for
the power of beauty

52:45.930 --> 52:47.630
will sooner transform honesty

52:47.632 --> 52:50.666
from what it is to a bawd
than the force of honesty

52:50.668 --> 52:53.302
can translate beauty
into his likeness.

52:53.304 --> 52:55.104
This was sometime a paradox,

52:55.106 --> 52:56.939
but now the time gives it proof.

52:59.043 --> 53:00.342
I did love you once.

53:03.514 --> 53:04.380
- Aye, my lord.

53:05.583 --> 53:06.949
You made me believe so.

53:09.987 --> 53:12.154
- [Hamlet] You should
not have believed me,

53:12.156 --> 53:14.723
for our virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock,

53:14.725 --> 53:16.058
but we shall relish of it.

53:18.529 --> 53:19.528
I loved you not.

53:23.334 --> 53:24.867
- I was the more deceived.

53:30.007 --> 53:31.140
- Get thee to a nunnery.

53:33.144 --> 53:35.244
Why wouldst thou be
a breeder of sinners?

53:36.013 --> 53:37.913
I am myself indifferent honest,

53:37.915 --> 53:39.582
but yet I could accuse
me of such things

53:39.584 --> 53:41.717
that it were better my
mother had not borne me.

53:41.719 --> 53:42.985
I am very proud,

53:42.987 --> 53:45.988
revengeful, ambitious,

53:46.924 --> 53:47.957
with more offenses at my beck

53:47.959 --> 53:49.792
than I have thoughts
to put them in,

53:49.794 --> 53:51.327
imagination to give them shape,

53:51.329 --> 53:52.895
or time to act them in.

53:56.100 --> 53:57.533
What should such fellows as I do

53:57.535 --> 53:59.235
crawling between
earth and heaven?

54:01.138 --> 54:02.905
We are arrant knaves all.

54:05.042 --> 54:08.010
Go thy ways to a nunnery.

54:09.213 --> 54:12.081
(wood creaking)

54:13.251 --> 54:14.283
Where's your father?

54:18.723 --> 54:21.056
- He is at home, my lord.

54:21.058 --> 54:23.359
(gentle instrumental music)

54:23.361 --> 54:26.028
(wood rattling)

54:33.938 --> 54:36.005
- Let the doors be shut upon him

54:37.608 --> 54:39.041
that he may play
the fool nowhere

54:39.043 --> 54:40.409
but in his own house.

54:47.018 --> 54:48.250
Farewell.

54:48.252 --> 54:52.087
- [Ophelia] Oh help
him, you sweet heavens.

54:52.089 --> 54:54.757
(whimpering)

54:54.759 --> 54:56.025
- If thou dost marry,

54:56.027 --> 54:57.626
I'll give thee this
plague for thy dowry.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.161
Be thou as chaste as ice,

54:59.163 --> 55:01.730
as pure as snow, thou
shalt not escape calumny.

55:03.067 --> 55:04.166
Get thee to a nunnery, farewell,

55:04.168 --> 55:08.037
or if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool,

55:08.039 --> 55:10.072
for wise men know well enough

55:10.074 --> 55:12.308
what monsters you make of them.

55:12.310 --> 55:14.910
To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too,

55:14.912 --> 55:16.111
farewell.

55:16.113 --> 55:17.646
- Oh heavenly
powers, restore him.

55:17.648 --> 55:19.381
- I have heard of your
paintings too, well enough.

55:19.383 --> 55:20.783
God hath given you one face,

55:20.785 --> 55:22.251
and you make yourselves another.

55:22.253 --> 55:25.054
You jig and amble, and you lisp.

55:25.056 --> 55:27.122
You nickname God's creatures

55:27.124 --> 55:29.658
and make your wantonness
your ignorance.

55:30.795 --> 55:31.794
Go to.

55:31.796 --> 55:32.795
I'll no more on it.

55:32.797 --> 55:34.530
It hath made me mad.

55:34.532 --> 55:36.699
(crying)

55:39.403 --> 55:42.104
I say we will have
no more marriage.

55:44.108 --> 55:46.241
Those that are married already,

55:46.243 --> 55:47.076
all but one shall live.

55:47.078 --> 55:49.445
The rest shall keep as they are.

55:49.447 --> 55:50.813
To a nunnery, go.

55:54.151 --> 55:56.285
- Oh, woe is me,

55:57.888 --> 56:00.122
to have seen what I have seen,

56:00.124 --> 56:02.491
to see what I see.

56:02.493 --> 56:06.161
(gentle instrumental music)

56:07.498 --> 56:09.631
(crying)

56:13.137 --> 56:16.038
(match striking)

56:19.110 --> 56:21.910
(fire crackling)

56:23.080 --> 56:24.947
- [Claudius] He shall
with speed to England

56:24.949 --> 56:27.182
for the demand of our
neglected tribute.

56:27.184 --> 56:28.984
Haply the seas and
countries different,

56:28.986 --> 56:31.253
with variable
objects shall expel

56:31.255 --> 56:33.288
this something settled
matter in his heart.

56:33.290 --> 56:35.124
- It shall do well,

56:35.126 --> 56:38.293
but yet do I believe the
origin and commencement

56:38.295 --> 56:40.729
of his grief sprung
from neglected love.

56:42.133 --> 56:43.132
How now, Ophelia?

56:45.169 --> 56:46.668
You need not tell us
what Lord Hamlet said.

56:46.670 --> 56:47.536
We heard it all.

56:51.776 --> 56:53.876
My lord, do as you please,

56:53.878 --> 56:56.678
but if you hold it fit,

56:56.680 --> 57:00.549
after the play, let his queen
mother all alone entreat him.

57:00.551 --> 57:01.884
Let her be round with him,

57:01.886 --> 57:03.685
and I'll be placed,
so please you,

57:03.687 --> 57:05.320
in the ear of all
their conference.

57:05.322 --> 57:07.956
If she find him not,
to England send him,

57:07.958 --> 57:10.559
or confine him where your
wisdom best shall think.

57:10.561 --> 57:12.528
(birds cawing)

57:12.530 --> 57:13.395
- It shall be so.

57:14.799 --> 57:17.299
Madness in great ones
must not unwatched go.

57:20.204 --> 57:23.272
(pencil scratching)

57:27.144 --> 57:29.912
(water dripping)

57:38.456 --> 57:40.322
(gentle instrumental music)

57:40.324 --> 57:43.258
(water dripping)

58:22.666 --> 58:24.233
(screaming)

58:24.235 --> 58:26.201
(water running)

58:26.203 --> 58:28.871
(bird chirping)

58:41.519 --> 58:44.086
- Speak the speech, I pray you,

58:44.088 --> 58:47.723
as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue,

58:47.725 --> 58:50.626
but if you mouth it, as
many of our players do,

58:50.628 --> 58:53.695
I had as lief the town
crier spoke my lines,

58:53.697 --> 58:56.798
nor do not saw the air too
much with your hand thus,

58:56.800 --> 58:58.400
but use all gently,

58:58.402 --> 59:01.503
for in the very torrent,
tempest, and as I may say,

59:01.505 --> 59:03.539
whirlwind of your passion,

59:03.541 --> 59:06.141
you must acquire and
beget a temperance

59:06.143 --> 59:08.310
that may give it smoothness.

59:08.312 --> 59:09.645
Oh, it offends me
to the soul to hear

59:09.647 --> 59:12.347
a robustious,
periwig pated fellow

59:12.349 --> 59:15.417
tear a passion to
tatters, to very rags,

59:15.419 --> 59:17.419
to split the ears
of the groundlings,

59:17.421 --> 59:19.454
who for the most
part are capable

59:19.456 --> 59:22.257
of nothing but inexplicable
dumb shows and noise.

59:22.259 --> 59:23.458
It out Herods Herod.

59:23.460 --> 59:25.460
Pray you, avoid it.

59:25.462 --> 59:26.929
- I warrant your honor.

59:28.365 --> 59:30.365
- Be not too tame neither,

59:30.367 --> 59:34.303
but let your own
discretion be your tutor.

59:34.305 --> 59:37.306
Suit the action to the word,
the word to the action,

59:37.308 --> 59:39.074
with this special observance

59:39.076 --> 59:42.311
that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature.

59:42.313 --> 59:44.913
For anything so overdone

59:44.915 --> 59:47.749
is from the purpose
of playing, whose end,

59:47.751 --> 59:51.720
both at the first and
now was and is to hold,

59:51.722 --> 59:55.424
as it were, the
mirror up to nature.

59:57.561 --> 59:59.061
Oh, there be players
that I have seen play

59:59.063 --> 01:00:01.496
and heard others
praise, and that highly,

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:03.732
not to speak it profanely,

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:06.335
that neither having the accent
of Christians nor the gait

01:00:06.337 --> 01:00:08.370
of Christian, pagan, nor man,

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:10.172
have so strutted and bellowed

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.340
that I have thought some

01:00:11.342 --> 01:00:12.941
of nature's journeymen
had made men,

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.376
and not made them well,

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:16.812
they imitated humanity
so abominably.

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:22.284
- I hope we have reformed that
indifferently with us, sir.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.986
- Oh, reform it altogether.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.054
Go, make you ready.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:35.197
(wood knocking)

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:36.498
How now, my lord.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.599
Will the King hear
this piece of work?

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:40.969
- And the Queen too,
and that presently.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.841
- [Hamlet] Bid the
players make haste.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.377
Will you two help
to hasten them?

01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:49.778
- Aye, my lord.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.547
(wind blowing)

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:55.183
- [Hamlet] What ho, Horatio.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.421
- Here, sweet lord,
at your service.

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:01.923
- Horatio, thou art
even as just a man

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:03.959
as e'er my conversation
coped withal.

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:04.926
- My dear lord, I--

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:06.428
- Nay, do not think I flatter.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.530
There is a play tonight
before the King.

01:01:08.532 --> 01:01:10.565
One scene of it comes
near the circumstance

01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:13.168
which I have told thee
of my father's death.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.971
I prithee, when thou
seest that act afoot,

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:19.675
even with the very comment of
thy soul, observe my uncle.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:24.146
If his occulted guilt do not
itself unkennel in one speech,

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:26.348
it is a damned ghost
that we have seen,

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:30.752
and my imaginations are as
foul as Vulcan's stithy.

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:32.020
Give him heedful note,

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.622
for I mine eyes will
rivet to his face,

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:36.358
and after, we will
both our judgments join

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.759
in censure of his seeming.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.862
- Well, my lord,
if he steal aught

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.365
the whilst this play is
playing and escape detecting,

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.399
I will pay the theft.

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:45.600
- They are coming to the play.

01:01:45.602 --> 01:01:46.401
I must be idle.

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:47.669
Get you a place.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:50.872
- [Claudius] How fares
our cousin Hamlet?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.375
- Excellent in faith,
of the chameleon's dish.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:56.011
I eat the air, promise crammed.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:57.813
You cannot feed capons so.

01:01:57.815 --> 01:02:00.515
- I have nothing with
this answer, Hamlet.

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:01.783
These words are not mine.

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:05.187
- No, nor mine now.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.823
My lord, you played once
in the university, you say?

01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:12.294
- That did I, my lord, and
was accounted a good actor.

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:13.261
- What did you enact?

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:15.464
- I did enact Julius Caesar.

01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:16.598
I was killed at the Capitol.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.066
Brutus killed me.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.135
- It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:20.936
(wood thudding)

01:02:20.938 --> 01:02:22.604
Be the players ready?

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:23.472
- Aye, my lord.

01:02:23.474 --> 01:02:25.507
They stay upon your patience.

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:26.875
(gentle instrumental music)

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:28.844
- The instances that
second marriage move

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:32.547
are base respects of
thrift, but none of love.

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:35.083
(gentle instrumental music)

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.586
A second time I
kill my husband dead

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:41.123
when second husband
kisses me in bed.

01:02:43.227 --> 01:02:45.927
- [Man] I do believe you
think what now you speak.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.263
- Come hither, my dear
Hamlet, sit by me.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.132
- No good mother, here's
metal more attractive.

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:51.566
- [Man] Do determine oft--

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:53.568
- Oh, do you mark that?

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:57.706
- [Man] Purpose is but
the slave to memory,

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:02.444
a violent birth
but for validity.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:06.782
Now the fruit unripe
sticks on the tree

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:09.618
but fall unshaken
when they mellow be.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:13.855
Most necessary 'tis
that we forget--

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.157
- Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.591
- [Man] Ourselves is debt.

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:18.059
- No, my lord.

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:19.327
- [Man] What to
ourselves in passion we--

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:21.129
- I mean my head upon your lap.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.165
- [Ophelia] Aye, my lord.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.699
- Do you think I
meant country matters?

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:25.834
- I think--

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.937
- [Man] Where joy most
revels, grief doth--

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:29.738
- Nothing--

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.939
- [Man] Grief joys--

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:31.873
- My lord.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:33.475
- [Man] On slender accident--

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:36.578
- That's a fair thought to
lie between maids' legs.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.946
- What is, my lord?

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.181
- Nothing.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.716
- You are merry, my lord.

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:42.517
- Who, I?

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:43.585
- Aye, my lord.

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:46.922
- What should a man
do but be merry?

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.557
For look you how
cheerfully my mother looks,

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:50.559
and my father died
within two hours.

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:52.627
- Nay, 'tis twice
two months, my lord.

01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:54.963
(wind blowing)

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:57.299
- [Man] Our thoughts are ours--

01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:58.600
- So long?

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:03.672
- [Man] Their ends
none of our own.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:06.441
- Is this a prologue
or the posy of a ring?

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:07.242
- 'Tis brief, my lord.

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:08.410
- As woman's love.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.581
- [Man] So think thou wilt
no second husband wed,

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:17.419
but die thy thoughts when
thy first lord is dead.

01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:22.991
- Nor earth to me give
food, nor heaven light.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:28.730
Sport and repose lock
from me day and night.

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:33.034
To desperation turn
my trust and hope,

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.938
and anchor's cheer in
prison be my scope.

01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:42.010
Each opposite that
blanks the face of joy

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:45.814
meet what I would have
well and it destroy,

01:04:45.816 --> 01:04:49.417
so here and hence pursue
me lasting strife.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.055
If once a widow, ever I be wife.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.790
(gentle instrumental music)

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:56.691
- [Man] 'Tis--

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:57.726
- Madam, how like you this play?

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:02.731
- The lady doth protest
too much, methinks.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.200
- [Man] My spirits grow dull,

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:08.236
and fain I would beguile
the tedious day with sleep

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.571
- [Claudius] What do
you call the play?

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.807
- [Woman] Sleep rock thy
brain, and never come--

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:13.808
- The Mousetrap.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:14.776
- [Woman] Between us twain.

01:05:14.778 --> 01:05:15.877
- Marry, how?

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.213
Tropically.

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:20.649
This play is the image of
a murder done in Vienna.

01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:23.084
Gonzago is the duke's
name, his wife Baptista.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:24.419
You shall see anon.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.988
'Tis a knavish piece of
work, but what of that?

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.857
Your Majesty and we
that have free souls,

01:05:28.859 --> 01:05:29.925
it touches us not.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:34.095
This is one Lucianus,
nephew to the king.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.032
He poisons him in the
garden for his estate.

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:38.533
His name's Gonzago.

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:39.801
You shall see anon
how the murderer

01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:41.569
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:45.206
- You are as good
as chorus, my lord.

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:46.808
- I could interpret
between you and your love,

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.410
if I could see the
puppets dallying.

01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:49.711
- You are keen, my lord.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:51.012
You are keen.

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:53.782
- It would cost you a groaning
to take off mine edge.

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:57.519
Begin murderer.

01:05:57.521 --> 01:06:00.055
Come, the croaking raven
doth bellow for revenge.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:01.756
(gentle instrumental music)

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:03.925
- [Lucianus] Thoughts black,

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:05.727
hands apt,

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:08.763
drugs fit, and time agreeing,

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:12.734
confederate season,
else no creature seeing.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:19.240
Thou mixture rank, of
midnight weeds collected,

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:23.378
with Hecate's ban thrice
blasted, thrice infected.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:27.749
Thy natural magic
and dire property

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:31.353
on wholesome life
usurp immediately.

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:33.855
(groaning)

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:35.090
- [Ophelia] The King rises.

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.891
- [Gertrude] How fares my lord?

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:38.259
(yelling)

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:39.527
- Give o'er the play.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:41.329
- Give me some light.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.264
Away.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:45.734
- [Polonius] Lights, lights.

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:47.002
(clapping)

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:48.370
Lights, lights.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:50.672
(metal thudding)

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:54.576
- For thou dost
know, oh Damon dear,

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:59.514
this realm dismantled
was of Jove himself,

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:04.586
and now reigns here
a very, very peacock.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:06.721
(wind blowing)

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:08.490
- You might have rhymed.

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:09.791
- Good Horatio,

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.026
I'll take the ghost's
word for 1,000 pound.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:11.826
Didst perceive?

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:13.128
- Very well, my lord.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.396
- Upon the talk
of the poisoning?

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:15.830
- [Horatio] I did
very well note him.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:18.133
- [Guildenstern] Good my lord,
vouchsafe me a word with you.

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:20.402
- Sir, a whole history.

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:21.836
- The King, sir.

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:23.605
- [Hamlet] Aye sir, what of him?

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:25.774
- [Guildenstern] Is
in his retirement
marvelous distempered.

01:07:25.776 --> 01:07:27.242
- [Hamlet] With drink, sir?

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.109
- No.

01:07:28.979 --> 01:07:30.779
My lord, your mother,

01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:32.781
with much great
affliction of spirit,

01:07:32.783 --> 01:07:34.015
hath sent me to you.

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:35.050
- You are welcome.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.384
- Nay, my good lord,

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.986
this courtesy is not
of the right breed.

01:07:37.988 --> 01:07:40.221
If it shall please you to
make me a wholesome answer,

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.823
I will do your
mother's commandment.

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:43.191
If not, your pardon,

01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:45.560
and my return shall be
the end of my business.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:46.995
- Sir, I cannot.

01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:49.664
- [Rosencrantz] What, my lord?

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.266
- Make you a wholesome answer.

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.868
My wit's diseased,

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:56.571
but, sir, such answer as I
can make you shall command,

01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:00.141
or rather, as you
say, my mother.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:01.876
Therefore no more
but to the matter.

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:02.844
My mother, you say?

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:04.245
- She desires to speak with you

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.847
in her closet ere you go to bed.

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:08.249
- We shall obey were
she 10 times our mother.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.018
Have you any further
trade with us?

01:08:12.022 --> 01:08:14.422
- My lord, you once did love me.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:17.192
- And do still, by these
pickers and stealers.

01:08:17.194 --> 01:08:18.493
- Good my lord,

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.261
what is the cause
of your distemper?

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.430
You do surely bar the
door upon your own liberty

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.432
if you deny your
griefs to your friend.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:29.970
- Will you play upon this pipe?

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:31.005
- My lord, I cannot.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.073
- [Hamlet] I pray you.

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:33.875
- Believe me, I cannot.

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:35.243
- [Hamlet] I do beseech you.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:37.779
- I know no touch
of it, my lord.

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:39.180
- It is as easy as lying.

01:08:39.182 --> 01:08:41.816
Govern these ventages with
your fingers and thumb.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:42.884
Give it breath with your mouth,

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:45.019
and it will discourse
most eloquent music.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.488
Look you, these are the stops.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.491
- I have not the skill.

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:52.327
- Why look you now, how
unworthy a thing you make of me.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.595
You would play upon me.

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:56.231
You would seem to know my stops.

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:58.066
You would pluck out the
heart of my mystery.

01:08:58.068 --> 01:09:00.935
'Sblood! Do you
think I am easier

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:03.404
to be played on than a pipe?

01:09:03.406 --> 01:09:04.671
Call me what
instrument you will.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:05.540
Though you can fret me,

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:06.741
(coughing)

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:09.109
you cannot play upon me.

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:10.245
(gasping)

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:14.115
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:21.589
(metal thudding)

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.044
Now could I drink hot blood

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.947
and do such bitter business

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.950
as the day would
quake to look on.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:55.023
Soft, now to my mother.

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:59.994
I will speak daggers
to her, but use none.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:03.131
- I like him not,

01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:06.301
nor stands it safe with us
to let his madness range.

01:10:06.303 --> 01:10:07.468
Therefore prepare you.

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:09.938
I your commission will
forthwith dispatch,

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.807
and he to England
shall along with you.

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:13.841
- We will haste us.

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:21.015
- My lord, he's going
to his mother's closet.

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:25.486
Behind the arras I'll convey
myself to hear the process.

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:26.788
Fare you well, my liege.

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:29.324
I'll call upon you
ere you go to bed

01:10:29.326 --> 01:10:31.693
and tell you what I know.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.698
(wind blowing)

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:43.271
- Oh, my offense is rank.

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:47.008
It smells to heaven,

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:51.379
hath the primal
eldest curse upon it,

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:54.048
a brother's murder.

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:56.985
Pray can I not,

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.188
for I am still possessed
of those effects

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:01.623
for which I did the murder,

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:06.394
my crown, mine own
ambition, and my queen.

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:11.032
May one be pardoned
and retain the offense?

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.569
In the corrupted
currents of this world,

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:17.138
offense's gilded hand
may shove by justice

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.041
and oft 'tis seen the
wicked prize itself

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:23.411
buys out the law, but
'tis not so above.

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:27.048
There is no shuffling.

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:30.652
There the action lies
in his true nature,

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:32.186
and we ourselves compelled,

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:34.989
even to the teeth and
forehead of our faults,

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.090
to give in evidence.

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:39.027
What then?

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.163
What rests?

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:46.200
Try what repentance can.

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:47.835
What can it not?

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:51.306
Yet what can it when
one cannot repent?

01:11:55.178 --> 01:11:58.379
Help, angels.

01:12:00.884 --> 01:12:01.849
Make assay.

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:10.091
(beads clattering)

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:11.426
Bow, stubborn knees.

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:15.063
(gentle instrumental music)

01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:19.767
All may be well.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:24.672
- Now might I do it pat.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.112
Now he is a-praying,

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.684
and now I'll do it,

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.087
(mumbling)

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:49.630
and so he goes to heaven,

01:12:51.101 --> 01:12:52.900
and so am I revenged.

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:55.169
(gasping)

01:12:56.106 --> 01:12:58.106
That would be scanned.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:02.777
A villain kills my
father, and for that,

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:07.849
I, his sole son, do this
same villain send to heaven.

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:12.053
No.

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:17.658
- [Claudius Voiceover]
My words fly up.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.360
My thoughts remain below.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:24.999
Words without thoughts
never to heaven go.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.436
- [Hamlet] Mother.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.372
Mother?

01:13:31.374 --> 01:13:32.740
- [Gertrude] Withdraw,
I hear him coming.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:35.676
- Mother.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:40.415
(metal clattering)

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.750
Now mother, what's the matter?

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:47.755
- Hamlet, thou hast thy
father much offended.

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:52.894
- Mother, you have my
father much offended.

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:55.930
- Come, come, you answer
with an idle tongue.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:58.299
- Go, go, you question
with a wicked tongue.

01:13:58.301 --> 01:13:59.267
- How now, Hamlet?

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:02.603
- What's the matter now?

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:05.807
- Have you forgot me?

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:09.310
- No, by the rood, not so.

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:12.213
You're the Queen, your
husband's brother's wife,

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:14.649
and would it were not
so, you are my mother.

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:18.186
- Nay, then I'll set those
to you that can speak.

01:14:18.188 --> 01:14:19.420
- Come, come and sit you down.

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:20.922
You shall not budge.

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:23.057
You go not till I
set you up a glass

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.226
where you may see the
inmost part of you.

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:26.627
- What wilt thou do?

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.863
Thou wilt not murder me?

01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:30.031
Help, ho--

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:31.365
- [Polonius] What ho, help--

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:32.333
- [Gertrude] Help--

01:14:32.335 --> 01:14:33.334
- How now, a rat?

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:34.135
- [Polonius] Help.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.404
(screaming)

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:39.207
(metal thudding)

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:41.542
(groaning)

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.681
- Oh me, what hast thou done?

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:47.482
- Nay, I know not.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:48.349
Is it the King?

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:52.353
- Oh, what a rash and
bloody deed is this.

01:14:52.355 --> 01:14:53.221
- A bloody deed,

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:55.389
almost as bad, good mother,

01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:57.959
as kill a king and
marry with his brother.

01:14:57.961 --> 01:14:59.393
- As kill a king?

01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:01.062
- Aye, lady, it was my word.

01:15:02.465 --> 01:15:03.798
Leave wringing of your hands.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.268
Peace, sit you down, and
let me wring your heart.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:10.404
Look you upon this
picture and on this,

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:12.406
(gentle instrumental music)

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:14.675
the counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:16.978
See what a grace was
seated on this brow,

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.615
Hyperion's curls, the
front of Jove himself,

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:23.384
an eye like Mars' to
threaten and command,

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:25.686
a station like
the herald Mercury

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.855
new lighted on a
heaven kissing hill,

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.491
a combination and a form indeed

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:32.927
where every god did
seem to set his seal

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:35.329
to give the world
assurance of a man.

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:38.332
This was your husband.

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:40.334
Look you now what follows.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:43.137
Here is your husband.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:45.339
Could you on this
fair mountain leave

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:47.341
to feed and batten
on this moor, huh?

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:49.410
Have you eyes?

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:51.546
You cannot call it
love, for at your age,

01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:53.414
the heyday in the blood is tame.

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:56.117
It's humble and waits
upon the judgment,

01:15:56.119 --> 01:15:59.620
and what judgment would
step from this to this?

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:01.355
Oh, shame, where is thy blush?

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:02.957
- Oh, Hamlet, speak no more.

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:05.660
Thou turnest mine eyes
into my very soul,

01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:08.529
and there I see such
black and grained spots

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:09.931
as will not leave their tinct.

01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:11.766
- Nay, but to live
in the rank sweat

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:15.036
of an enseamed bed,
stewed in corruption,

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:17.638
honeying and making
love over the nasty sty.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.839
- Oh, speak no more.

01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:21.742
These words like daggers
enter in my ears.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.244
No more, sweet Hamlet.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:24.946
- A murderer and a villain,

01:16:24.948 --> 01:16:27.715
a slave that is not
20th part the tithe

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:30.251
of your precedent
lord, a vice of kings,

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.087
a cutpurse of
empire and the rule,

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.957
that from a shelf the
precious diadem stole

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:36.924
and put it in his pocket--

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.092
- No more.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.260
- A king of shreds and patches.

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:40.394
(yelling)

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:41.662
(panting)

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:42.997
(bell ringing)

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:46.934
(gentle instrumental music)

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:47.802
Save me,

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:54.575
and hover o'er me with your
wings, you heavenly guards.

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.245
What would your gracious figure?

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:01.248
- Alas.

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:03.684
He's mad.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:12.360
- How is it with you, lady?

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:16.597
- Alas,

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.201
how is it with you?

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:23.671
Oh, gentle son.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:29.443
Upon the heat and
flame of thy distemper

01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:31.846
sprinkle cool patience.

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:34.415
Whereon do you look?

01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:38.919
- [Hamlet] Do you
see nothing there?

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:41.122
- Nothing at all,

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:42.990
yet all that is I see.

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:46.560
- Nor did you nothing hear?

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:48.029
- No, nothing but ourselves.

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:52.566
- Why, look you there.

01:17:52.568 --> 01:17:53.934
Look, how it steals away,

01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:55.803
my father in his
habit as he lived.

01:18:01.411 --> 01:18:04.478
It is not madness
that I have uttered.

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:12.420
Mother, for love of grace,

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:16.357
lay not a flattering
unction to your soul

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.560
that not your trespass,
but my madness speaks.

01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:20.928
Confess yourself to heaven.

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:22.897
- Oh, Hamlet.

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:29.637
Thou hast cleft
my heart in twain.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:33.741
- I must be cruel
only to be kind.

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:38.145
This bad begins, and
worse remains behind.

01:18:41.184 --> 01:18:42.550
One word more, good lady.

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:46.187
- What shall I do?

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:52.493
- Not this, by no means,
that I bid you do.

01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:54.695
Let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed,

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:58.065
pinch wanton on your
cheek, call you his mouse,

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:01.268
and let him, for a
pair of reechy kisses

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:04.305
or paddling in your neck
with his damned fingers,

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:06.307
make you to ravel
all this matter out

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:10.745
that I essentially
am not in madness,

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:12.713
but mad in craft.

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:20.521
- Be thou assured, if
words be made of breath,

01:19:21.524 --> 01:19:23.624
and breath of life,

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:28.162
I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:43.144
- I must to England.

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:48.582
You know that.

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:55.256
This man shall set me packing.

01:19:58.528 --> 01:20:00.628
I'll lug the guts into
the neighbor room.

01:20:02.865 --> 01:20:05.533
Mother, good night indeed.

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:09.103
This counselor is
now most still,

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:11.138
most secret, and most grave,

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.708
that was in life a
foolish prating knave.

01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:16.877
Come, sir, to draw
toward an end with you.

01:20:16.879 --> 01:20:20.548
(gentle instrumental music)

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:24.618
Good night, mother.

01:20:29.559 --> 01:20:32.092
- [Claudius] Where is your son?

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.632
Where has he gone?

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:40.634
- To draw apart the
body he hath killed.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:47.308
(gasping)

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:53.113
- Oh Gertrude, come away.

01:20:53.115 --> 01:20:54.782
The sun no sooner shall
the mountains touch

01:20:54.784 --> 01:20:56.517
but we will ship him hence.

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:01.989
(gentle instrumental music)

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.894
(cloth scraping)

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.832
(body thudding)

01:21:13.469 --> 01:21:14.301
- Safely stowed.

01:21:15.972 --> 01:21:17.238
- [Rosencrantz] Hamlet.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.807
- [Guildenstern] Hamlet.

01:21:19.809 --> 01:21:20.608
Hamlet.

01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:22.576
- But soft, what noise?

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:23.611
Who calls on Hamlet?

01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:24.411
- [Rosencrantz] My lord.

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:26.146
- Oh, here they come.

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:31.852
- What have you done, my
lord, with the dead body?

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:36.023
- [Hamlet] Compounded it
with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:38.025
- My lord, you must tell
us where the body is.

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:39.426
- Do not believe it.

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:41.095
- Believe what, my lord?

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:44.398
- That I can keep your
counsel and not mine own.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.434
Besides, to be
demanded of a sponge,

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:50.905
what replication should be
made by the son of a king?

01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:53.841
- Take you me for
a sponge, my lord?

01:21:53.843 --> 01:21:56.443
- Aye sir, that soaks up
the King's countenance,

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.178
his rewards, his authorities--

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.214
- I understand you not, my lord.

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:01.448
- I am glad of it.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.918
A knavish speech sleeps
in a foolish ear.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.252
- My lord, you must tell us

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.821
where the body is and
go with us to the King.

01:22:07.823 --> 01:22:10.658
- The body is with the King,

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.027
but the King is
not with the body.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:14.528
The King is a thing--

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.597
- A thing, my lord?

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:19.533
- Of nothing.

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:23.671
Bring me to him.

01:22:25.675 --> 01:22:26.473
(yelling)

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:27.574
Hide fox, and all after.

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:29.710
(wood thudding)

01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:31.979
(panting)

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:49.763
(rock thudding)

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:53.434
(gentle instrumental music)

01:22:55.838 --> 01:22:56.904
- How now?

01:22:56.906 --> 01:22:58.238
What hath befallen?

01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.873
- Where the dead
body is bestowed,

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.842
my lord, we cannot get from him.

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:05.746
(match striking)

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:17.324
- [Claudius] Now Hamlet,
where is Polonius?

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:21.228
- At supper.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:24.932
- [Claudius] At supper where?

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:28.969
- Not where he eats,
but where he's eaten.

01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:33.307
A certain convocation of
politic worms are eating at him.

01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:35.609
- Where is Polonius?

01:23:39.815 --> 01:23:40.681
- In heaven?

01:23:41.884 --> 01:23:43.150
Send thither to see.

01:23:43.152 --> 01:23:44.618
If your messenger
find him not there,

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.387
seek him in the
other place yourself.

01:23:46.389 --> 01:23:47.421
- Hamlet.

01:23:48.924 --> 01:23:51.925
This deed, for thine
especial safety,

01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:53.794
which we do tender as
dearly as we grieve

01:23:53.796 --> 01:23:55.829
for that which thou hast done,

01:23:55.831 --> 01:23:58.832
must send thee hence
with fiery quickness.

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:02.536
Therefore prepare yourself--

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:03.670
- [Both] For England.

01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:06.306
- Aye, Hamlet.

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:09.777
- Good.

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:13.647
(gentle instrumental music)

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:16.850
Farewell, dear mother.

01:24:20.956 --> 01:24:21.922
- Thy loving father, Hamlet.

01:24:21.924 --> 01:24:23.857
- My mother.

01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:25.659
Father and mother
is man and wife.

01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:28.829
Man and wife is one
flesh, and so, my mother.

01:24:29.799 --> 01:24:31.598
Come, for England.

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:44.178
I do not know why
yet I live to say

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.679
this thing's to do,

01:24:46.449 --> 01:24:49.883
Sith I have cause, and will,

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:53.153
and strength, and
means to do it.

01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:57.191
Oh, from this time forth,

01:24:57.193 --> 01:25:00.961
my thoughts be bloody
or be nothing worth.

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:06.166
(cutlery rattling)

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:15.843
(sipping)

01:25:18.214 --> 01:25:20.414
(jet engine running)

01:25:20.416 --> 01:25:24.518
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.187
(water flowing)

01:25:40.703 --> 01:25:42.870
(mumbling)

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:25.612
(humming)

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:30.851
(wind blowing)

01:26:37.092 --> 01:26:41.261
- Where is the beauteous
majesty of Denmark?

01:26:41.263 --> 01:26:42.930
- [Gertrude] How now, Ophelia?

01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:49.102
¶ How should I your
true love know ¶

01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:51.605
¶ From another one ¶

01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:54.508
¶ By his cockle hat and staff ¶

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:56.710
¶ And his sandal shoon ¶

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:59.012
- [Gertrude] Alas, sweet
lady, what imports this song--

01:26:59.014 --> 01:27:01.715
- Say you, nay, pray you mark.

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:05.118
¶ He is dead and gone, lady ¶

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.387
¶ He is dead and gone ¶

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:10.090
¶ At his head a
grass green turf ¶

01:27:10.092 --> 01:27:11.925
¶ At his heels a stone ¶

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:13.093
- Nay, but Ophelia--

01:27:13.095 --> 01:27:14.361
- Pray you, mark.

01:27:14.363 --> 01:27:16.296
¶ White his shroud as
the mountain snow ¶

01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:17.564
(screaming)

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:21.802
¶ Larded all with
sweet flowers ¶

01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:23.203
(gasping)

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:25.372
¶ To the grave ¶

01:27:25.374 --> 01:27:27.608
- [Gertrude] Alas,
look here, my lord.

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:29.109
(singing)

01:27:29.111 --> 01:27:31.612
¶ True love showers ¶

01:27:31.614 --> 01:27:34.047
- [Claudius] How do
you, pretty lady?

01:27:35.017 --> 01:27:38.685
(gentle instrumental music)

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.993
- Well, God 'ild you.

01:27:45.995 --> 01:27:48.595
They say the owl was
a baker's daughter.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:52.366
Lord, we know what we are
but not what we may be.

01:27:52.368 --> 01:27:53.867
- Conceit upon her father.

01:27:53.869 --> 01:27:57.070
- Pray, let's have
no words of this,

01:27:57.072 --> 01:28:00.140
but when they ask you what
it means, say you this.

01:28:00.142 --> 01:28:03.076
¶ Tomorrow is Saint
Valentine's day ¶

01:28:03.078 --> 01:28:05.145
¶ And all the morning bedtime ¶

01:28:05.147 --> 01:28:07.547
¶ And I a maid at your window ¶

01:28:07.549 --> 01:28:10.250
¶ To be your Valentine ¶

01:28:10.252 --> 01:28:12.753
¶ Then up he rose and
donned his clothes ¶

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:14.755
¶ And dupped the chamber door ¶

01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:16.923
(singing)

01:28:19.361 --> 01:28:21.662
(sighing)

01:28:21.664 --> 01:28:24.531
(insects buzzing)

01:28:32.274 --> 01:28:34.107
I hope all will be well.

01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:36.510
(gentle instrumental music)

01:28:36.512 --> 01:28:37.778
We must be patient,

01:28:39.248 --> 01:28:41.014
but I cannot choose
but weep to think

01:28:41.016 --> 01:28:43.684
they would lay him
in the cold ground.

01:28:43.686 --> 01:28:46.253
(mumbling)

01:28:46.255 --> 01:28:47.921
- How long hath she been thus?

01:29:00.235 --> 01:29:01.101
- Come.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.539
Come, my coach.

01:29:15.718 --> 01:29:17.284
Good night, ladies.

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:24.224
- Follow her close,

01:29:24.226 --> 01:29:26.126
and give her good
watch, I pray you.

01:29:30.165 --> 01:29:35.235
- [Ophelia] Good night.

01:29:38.173 --> 01:29:40.974
(cloth scraping)

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:45.946
(body thudding)

01:29:45.948 --> 01:29:49.616
(gentle instrumental music)

01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:01.328
- Oh thou vile king,

01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:03.063
(screaming)

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:04.264
give me my father.

01:30:04.266 --> 01:30:05.665
- Calmly, good Laertes.

01:30:05.667 --> 01:30:08.602
- That drop of blood that's
calm proclaims me bastard,

01:30:08.604 --> 01:30:09.870
cries cuckold to my father,

01:30:09.872 --> 01:30:11.171
brands the harlot even here

01:30:11.173 --> 01:30:14.307
between the chaste unsmirched
brow of my true mother.

01:30:14.309 --> 01:30:16.009
- What is the cause, Laertes,

01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:19.112
that thy rebellion
looks so giant like?

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:20.781
There's such divinity
doth hedge a king

01:30:20.783 --> 01:30:23.350
that treason can but
peep at what it would,

01:30:23.352 --> 01:30:25.118
acts little of his will.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.687
Tell me, Laertes, why
thou art thus incensed.

01:30:27.689 --> 01:30:29.556
Let him go, Gertrude.

01:30:29.558 --> 01:30:30.424
Speak, man.

01:30:31.293 --> 01:30:33.193
- Where is my father?

01:30:33.195 --> 01:30:34.194
- Dead.

01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:35.128
- But not by him.

01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:36.096
- Let him demand his fill.

01:30:37.232 --> 01:30:38.965
- How came he dead?

01:30:38.967 --> 01:30:40.801
I'll not be juggled with.

01:30:40.803 --> 01:30:42.235
Let come what comes,

01:30:42.237 --> 01:30:44.671
only I'll be revenged most
thoroughly for my father.

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:48.508
- Who shall stay you?

01:30:49.745 --> 01:30:51.611
That I am guiltless
of your father's death

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:53.814
and am most sensibly
in grief for it,

01:30:53.816 --> 01:30:55.449
it shall as level
to your judgment

01:30:55.451 --> 01:30:57.951
appear as day does to your eye.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:00.253
(whimpering)

01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:02.255
- How now?

01:31:02.257 --> 01:31:04.825
(singing)

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:07.394
(wind blowing)

01:31:12.434 --> 01:31:15.535
¶ They bore him bare ¶

01:31:16.672 --> 01:31:19.139
(whistling)

01:31:27.349 --> 01:31:32.419
¶ They bore him
barefaced on the bier ¶

01:31:34.223 --> 01:31:37.424
¶ Hey non nonny ¶

01:31:37.426 --> 01:31:39.960
¶ Hey nonny ¶

01:31:41.396 --> 01:31:43.663
- Oh heat, dry up my brains.

01:31:45.267 --> 01:31:49.402
¶ And on his grave
rained many a tear ¶

01:31:49.404 --> 01:31:50.270
- Oh, rose of May.

01:31:55.277 --> 01:31:57.811
¶ Fare you well, my dove ¶

01:31:57.813 --> 01:31:59.279
- Sweet Ophelia.

01:31:59.281 --> 01:32:02.115
¶ Fare you well, my dove ¶

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:04.251
¶ My dove ¶

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.955
(gentle instrumental music)

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:12.993
And you must sing

01:32:12.995 --> 01:32:14.694
¶ A-Down, a-down ¶

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:16.396
¶ Call him a-down ¶

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:18.198
¶ You a-down, a-down ¶

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.699
¶ Call him a-down ¶

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:22.269
Oh, how the wheel becomes it.

01:32:23.539 --> 01:32:26.306
It is the false steward that
stole his master's daughter.

01:32:28.677 --> 01:32:29.743
(grunting)

01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:30.610
There's rosemary.

01:32:31.547 --> 01:32:32.512
That's for remembrance.

01:32:32.514 --> 01:32:34.414
Pray you, love, remember,

01:32:36.318 --> 01:32:38.151
and there is pansies.

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:39.719
That's for thoughts.

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:42.489
There's fennel and columbines.

01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:45.225
(wind blowing)

01:32:46.495 --> 01:32:47.594
There's rue for you

01:32:49.498 --> 01:32:50.530
and some for me,

01:32:51.633 --> 01:32:54.034
and we may call it herb
of grace on Sundays.

01:32:55.137 --> 01:32:57.571
You must wear your
rue with a difference.

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:02.909
There's a daisy.

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.079
I would give you violets,

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:09.316
but they withered all
when my father died.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.154
They say he made a good end.

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:22.963
¶ For bonny sweet
Robin is all my joy ¶

01:33:22.965 --> 01:33:25.732
¶ All my joy ¶

01:33:25.734 --> 01:33:28.568
¶ All my joy ¶

01:33:28.570 --> 01:33:31.304
¶ All my joy ¶

01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:33.506
¶ All my joy ¶

01:33:33.508 --> 01:33:36.176
¶ All my joy ¶

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.014
(birds cawing)

01:33:41.016 --> 01:33:43.617
(wind blowing)

01:33:53.528 --> 01:33:55.362
(gentle instrumental music)

01:33:55.364 --> 01:33:57.831
(bird cawing)

01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:04.204
- "Ere we were two
days old at sea,

01:34:04.206 --> 01:34:07.240
"a pirate of very warlike
appointment gave us chase.

01:34:07.242 --> 01:34:08.575
"Finding ourselves
too slow of sail,

01:34:08.577 --> 01:34:10.744
"we put on a compelled valor,

01:34:10.746 --> 01:34:12.512
"and in the grapple
I boarded them.

01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:14.514
"On the instant, they
got clear of our ship,

01:34:14.516 --> 01:34:16.850
"so I alone became
their prisoner.

01:34:16.852 --> 01:34:19.786
"They have dealt with me
like thieves of mercy,

01:34:19.788 --> 01:34:22.355
"but they knew what they did.

01:34:22.357 --> 01:34:24.858
"I am to do a good
turn for them.

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:27.527
"Let the King have the
letters I have sent,

01:34:27.529 --> 01:34:29.229
"and repair thou
to me with as much

01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:31.398
"speed as thou
wouldst fly death.

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.968
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
hold their course for England.

01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:37.871
"Of them I have
much to tell thee.

01:34:37.873 --> 01:34:38.938
"Farewell."

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.674
(fire crackling)

01:34:40.676 --> 01:34:44.277
- [Hamlet] He that thou
knowest thine, Hamlet.

01:34:45.547 --> 01:34:48.548
- The Queen his mother
lives almost by his looks,

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:50.450
and for myself, my
virtue or my plague,

01:34:50.452 --> 01:34:52.052
be it either which,

01:34:52.054 --> 01:34:54.988
she is so conjunctive
to my life and soul

01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:56.956
that as the star moves
not but in his sphere,

01:34:56.958 --> 01:34:58.525
I could not but by her.

01:34:59.695 --> 01:35:02.195
- And so have I a
noble father lost,

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:04.464
a sister driven into
desperate terms,

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:06.433
whose worth, if praises
may go back again,

01:35:06.435 --> 01:35:08.068
stood challenger on mount of all

01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:09.569
the age for her perfections,

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.172
but my revenge will come.

01:35:12.174 --> 01:35:14.174
- I loved your father,

01:35:14.176 --> 01:35:15.842
and we love ourself,

01:35:15.844 --> 01:35:18.578
and that, I hope, will
teach you to imagine.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:19.879
How now?

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:20.814
What news?

01:35:20.816 --> 01:35:23.216
- Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.

01:35:23.218 --> 01:35:25.518
These to your Majesty,
this to the Queen.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.352
- From Hamlet?

01:35:27.122 --> 01:35:28.421
Who brought them?

01:35:28.423 --> 01:35:29.589
- [Horatio] Sailors,
my lord, they say.

01:35:29.591 --> 01:35:30.490
I saw them not.

01:35:30.492 --> 01:35:31.991
They were given me by Claudio.

01:35:31.993 --> 01:35:34.494
He received them of
him that brought them.

01:35:34.496 --> 01:35:36.029
- Laertes, you shall hear them.

01:35:36.031 --> 01:35:37.297
Leave us.

01:35:37.299 --> 01:35:39.899
(wind blowing)

01:35:42.471 --> 01:35:44.337
"High and mighty,

01:35:44.339 --> 01:35:47.607
"you shall know I am set
naked on your kingdom.

01:35:49.044 --> 01:35:52.345
"Tomorrow shall I beg leave
to see your kingly eyes,

01:35:52.347 --> 01:35:55.548
"when I shall, first
asking your pardon,

01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:58.518
"thereunto recount the
occasion of my sudden

01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.953
"and more strange return.

01:35:59.955 --> 01:36:00.820
"Hamlet."

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.289
What should this mean?

01:36:04.426 --> 01:36:05.492
All the rest come back,

01:36:05.494 --> 01:36:07.527
or is it some abuse
and no such thing?

01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:09.496
Naked,

01:36:10.632 --> 01:36:12.799
and in a postscript
here he says, "Alone."

01:36:14.503 --> 01:36:15.435
Can you advise me?

01:36:21.042 --> 01:36:23.476
- I am lost in it, my
lord, but let him come.

01:36:23.478 --> 01:36:25.245
It warms the very
sickness in my heart

01:36:25.247 --> 01:36:26.579
that I shall live and tell him

01:36:26.581 --> 01:36:29.015
to his teeth, thus didst thou.

01:36:30.185 --> 01:36:32.685
- If it be so, Laertes,
will you be ruled by me?

01:36:32.687 --> 01:36:35.421
- Aye, my lord, so you will
not overrule me to a peace.

01:36:36.525 --> 01:36:39.859
- What would you
undertake to show yourself

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:43.329
indeed your father's
son more than in words?

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:46.533
- To cut his throat
in the church.

01:36:46.535 --> 01:36:48.668
(gentle instrumental music)

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:50.103
- Keep close within
your chamber.

01:36:50.105 --> 01:36:52.205
Hamlet, returned, shall
know you are come home.

01:36:52.207 --> 01:36:54.274
We'll put on those shall
praise your excellence

01:36:54.276 --> 01:36:55.508
and set a double varnish

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:57.677
on the fame and
wager on your heads.

01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:59.579
He, being remiss, most generous,

01:36:59.581 --> 01:37:02.415
and free from all contriving,
will not peruse the foils,

01:37:02.417 --> 01:37:04.617
so that with ease, or
with a little shuffling,

01:37:04.619 --> 01:37:06.386
you may choose a sword unbated,

01:37:06.388 --> 01:37:09.389
and in a pass of practice
requite him for your father.

01:37:10.225 --> 01:37:11.090
- I will do it,

01:37:12.694 --> 01:37:14.561
and for that purpose
I'll anoint my sword.

01:37:14.563 --> 01:37:16.763
I bought an unction
of a mountebank.

01:37:16.765 --> 01:37:18.565
I'll touch my point
with this contagion,

01:37:18.567 --> 01:37:21.701
that if I gall him
slightly it may be death.

01:37:21.703 --> 01:37:24.370
- When in your motion
you are hot and dry,

01:37:24.372 --> 01:37:26.706
as make your bouts more
violent to that end,

01:37:26.708 --> 01:37:28.908
and that he calls for drink,

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.543
I'll have prepared him
a chalice for the nonce,

01:37:30.545 --> 01:37:31.911
whereon but sipping,

01:37:31.913 --> 01:37:34.247
if he by chance escape
your venom stuck,

01:37:34.249 --> 01:37:35.949
our purpose may hold there.

01:37:35.951 --> 01:37:39.819
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:37:44.526 --> 01:37:46.659
- One woe doth tread
upon another's heel,

01:37:48.630 --> 01:37:50.530
so fast they follow.

01:37:51.566 --> 01:37:54.100
(birds cawing)

01:37:56.338 --> 01:37:58.104
Your sister's drowned, Laertes.

01:37:59.674 --> 01:38:00.540
- Drowned?

01:38:01.776 --> 01:38:03.276
Oh.

01:38:03.278 --> 01:38:04.110
Where?

01:38:05.447 --> 01:38:09.182
- There is a willow
grows askant the brook

01:38:09.184 --> 01:38:12.752
that shows his hoar leaves
in the glassy stream.

01:38:12.754 --> 01:38:15.755
There, fantastic
garlands did she make

01:38:17.158 --> 01:38:19.726
of crowflowers, nettles,

01:38:21.696 --> 01:38:23.730
daisies, and long purples.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.666
That liberal shepherds
give a grosser name,

01:38:26.668 --> 01:38:30.703
but our cold maids do dead
men's fingers call them.

01:38:32.474 --> 01:38:35.975
There on the pendant bough,

01:38:35.977 --> 01:38:38.711
her coronet weeds
clamoring to hang,

01:38:38.713 --> 01:38:41.648
an envious sliver broke.

01:38:44.185 --> 01:38:46.986
When down her weedy
trophies and herself

01:38:46.988 --> 01:38:48.621
fell in the weeping brook,

01:38:48.623 --> 01:38:50.990
her clothes spread wide

01:38:53.228 --> 01:38:56.496
and mermaid like awhile
they bore her up,

01:38:57.732 --> 01:39:01.267
which time she chanted
snatches of old lauds,

01:39:02.404 --> 01:39:04.203
as one incapable of
her own distress,

01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:08.741
but long it could not be

01:39:08.743 --> 01:39:12.211
till that her garments,
heavy with their drink,

01:39:13.415 --> 01:39:16.015
pulled the poor wretch
from her melodious lay

01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:19.852
to muddy death.

01:39:19.854 --> 01:39:23.723
(gentle instrumental music)

01:39:28.363 --> 01:39:30.229
- [Claudius] How much I
had to do to calm his rage.

01:39:30.231 --> 01:39:32.098
Now I fear this will
give it start again.

01:39:33.935 --> 01:39:37.437
(grass crunching)

01:39:37.439 --> 01:39:39.706
(sighing)

01:39:42.944 --> 01:39:46.179
(water flowing)

01:39:46.181 --> 01:39:48.982
(birds chirping)

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.760
(wind blowing)

01:40:00.762 --> 01:40:04.430
(gentle instrumental music)

01:40:05.767 --> 01:40:07.300
- Sir, in my heart
there was a kind

01:40:07.302 --> 01:40:09.769
of fighting that would
not let me sleep.

01:40:09.771 --> 01:40:12.472
There's a divinity
that shapes our ends,

01:40:12.474 --> 01:40:13.940
rough hew them how we will.

01:40:13.942 --> 01:40:15.775
- [Horatio] That
is most certain.

01:40:15.777 --> 01:40:18.611
- Up from my cabin, my
sea gown scarfed about me,

01:40:18.613 --> 01:40:20.913
in the dark groped
I to find out them.

01:40:20.915 --> 01:40:22.882
Had my desire,
fingered their packet,

01:40:22.884 --> 01:40:25.118
and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again,

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.086
making so bold, my fears
forgetting manners,

01:40:27.088 --> 01:40:28.888
to unfold their
grand commission,

01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:33.493
where I found, Horatio,
a royal knavery,

01:40:33.495 --> 01:40:34.627
an exact command,

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:36.429
larded with many
several sorts of reasons

01:40:36.431 --> 01:40:39.198
importing Denmark's
health and England's too,

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.902
with such bugs and
goblins in my life

01:40:42.904 --> 01:40:45.638
that on the supervise,
no leisure bated,

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:48.574
no, not to stay the
grinding of the ax,

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:50.443
my head should be struck off.

01:40:50.445 --> 01:40:51.244
(birds chirping)

01:40:51.246 --> 01:40:52.045
- Is it possible?

01:40:52.047 --> 01:40:53.179
- Here's the commission.

01:40:53.181 --> 01:40:54.647
Read it at more leisure,

01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:56.849
but wilt thou hear
now how I did proceed?

01:40:56.851 --> 01:40:58.117
- I beseech you.

01:40:58.119 --> 01:41:01.654
- I sat me down, devised
a new commission.

01:41:01.656 --> 01:41:03.356
Wilt thou know the
effect of what I wrote?

01:41:03.358 --> 01:41:04.524
- Aye, good my lord.

01:41:04.526 --> 01:41:07.860
- An earnest conjuration
from the King,

01:41:07.862 --> 01:41:10.797
as England was his
faithful tributary,

01:41:10.799 --> 01:41:12.932
that on the view and
knowing of these contents,

01:41:12.934 --> 01:41:14.600
without debatement
further, more or less,

01:41:14.602 --> 01:41:16.836
he should those bearers
put to sudden death,

01:41:16.838 --> 01:41:18.871
not shriving time allowed.

01:41:18.873 --> 01:41:20.740
Now, the next day
was our sea fight,

01:41:20.742 --> 01:41:22.742
and what to this was sequent
thou knowest already.

01:41:22.744 --> 01:41:25.378
- So Guildenstern and
Rosencrantz go to it?

01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:27.847
- Why, man, they did make
love to this employment.

01:41:27.849 --> 01:41:29.649
They are not near my conscience.

01:41:31.386 --> 01:41:33.820
(grass crunching)

01:41:33.822 --> 01:41:36.422
(birds cawing)

01:41:41.563 --> 01:41:43.463
Whose grave is this, sirrah?

01:41:44.833 --> 01:41:46.099
- Mine, sir.

01:41:46.101 --> 01:41:48.968
- I think it be thine
indeed, for thou liest in it.

01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:51.904
- You lie out on it, sir,
and therefore 'tis not yours.

01:41:53.675 --> 01:41:58.744
For my part, sir, I do not
lie in it, yet it is mine.

01:42:00.014 --> 01:42:03.182
- Thou dost lie in it to be
in it and say it is thine.

01:42:03.184 --> 01:42:05.918
'Tis for the dead,
not for the quick.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.819
Therefore thou liest.

01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:08.354
- 'Tis a quick lie, sir.

01:42:09.524 --> 01:42:11.057
'Twill away again
from me to you.

01:42:12.494 --> 01:42:14.193
- What man dost thou dig it for?

01:42:15.196 --> 01:42:16.095
- [Gravedigger] For no man, sir.

01:42:16.097 --> 01:42:17.230
- What woman then?

01:42:17.232 --> 01:42:18.798
- For none, neither.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.933
- Who is to be buried in it?

01:42:20.935 --> 01:42:23.903
- One that was a woman, but
rest her soul, she's dead.

01:42:25.507 --> 01:42:26.873
- How absolute the knave is.

01:42:29.544 --> 01:42:31.377
How long hast thou
been grave maker?

01:42:33.715 --> 01:42:37.750
- I came to it that very day

01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:42.021
that young Hamlet was born,

01:42:43.158 --> 01:42:45.258
he that is mad and
sent to England.

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:47.160
- Aye, marry.

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.531
Why was he sent in to England?

01:42:51.533 --> 01:42:52.965
- Why, because he was mad.

01:42:54.068 --> 01:42:56.269
He shall recover his wits there.

01:42:56.271 --> 01:42:58.771
If he do not, 'tis no
great matter there.

01:42:58.773 --> 01:43:00.072
- Why?

01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:01.307
- 'Twill not be
seen in him there.

01:43:01.309 --> 01:43:03.042
There the men are as mad as he.

01:43:03.044 --> 01:43:04.343
- How came he mad?

01:43:05.547 --> 01:43:06.913
- [Gravedigger] Very
strangely, they say.

01:43:06.915 --> 01:43:08.714
- How strangely?

01:43:08.716 --> 01:43:09.949
- Faith, even with
losing his wits.

01:43:09.951 --> 01:43:10.950
- Upon what ground?

01:43:10.952 --> 01:43:12.752
- Why, here in Denmark.

01:43:16.658 --> 01:43:17.523
Here.

01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:24.096
A skull hath lien
you in the earth

01:43:24.098 --> 01:43:25.965
some three and 20 years.

01:43:25.967 --> 01:43:26.999
- Whose was it?

01:43:27.001 --> 01:43:29.535
- A whoreson mad
fellow's it was.

01:43:31.472 --> 01:43:32.872
Whose do you think it was?

01:43:34.275 --> 01:43:36.175
- Nay, I know not.

01:43:36.177 --> 01:43:41.013
- This same skull,
sir, was, sir,

01:43:43.318 --> 01:43:44.183
Yorick's skull.

01:43:46.621 --> 01:43:47.687
The King's jester?

01:43:47.689 --> 01:43:48.487
- This?

01:43:48.489 --> 01:43:49.355
- Even that.

01:43:50.225 --> 01:43:51.057
- Let me see.

01:43:56.164 --> 01:43:57.029
Alas.

01:44:01.236 --> 01:44:02.101
Poor Yorick.

01:44:03.705 --> 01:44:05.037
I knew him, Horatio,

01:44:06.608 --> 01:44:10.309
a fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

01:44:12.213 --> 01:44:14.380
He hath bore me on
his back 1,000 times,

01:44:14.382 --> 01:44:19.252
and now how abhorred in
my imagination it is.

01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:23.623
My gorge rises at it.

01:44:28.029 --> 01:44:30.062
Where be your gibes now,

01:44:30.999 --> 01:44:32.531
your gambols,

01:44:32.533 --> 01:44:35.034
your songs, your
flashes of merriment

01:44:35.036 --> 01:44:37.470
that were wont to set
the table on a roar?

01:44:38.806 --> 01:44:40.873
Not one now to mock
your own grinning?

01:44:42.277 --> 01:44:43.743
Quite chapfallen?

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:48.281
(birds cawing)

01:44:51.419 --> 01:44:53.819
Prithee, Horatio,
tell me one thing.

01:44:53.821 --> 01:44:55.254
- What's that, my lord?

01:44:55.256 --> 01:44:56.622
- Dost thou think
Alexander looked

01:44:56.624 --> 01:44:58.157
of this fashion in the earth?

01:44:58.159 --> 01:44:59.358
- Even so.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.226
- And smelt so?

01:45:01.362 --> 01:45:02.161
(coughing)

01:45:02.163 --> 01:45:03.062
- Even so, my lord.

01:45:03.064 --> 01:45:04.463
(gentle instrumental music)

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:05.931
- But soft, but soft awhile.

01:45:09.570 --> 01:45:12.438
(grass crunching)

01:45:16.044 --> 01:45:18.477
Here comes the King, the Queen.

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:19.779
Who is this they follow?

01:45:31.025 --> 01:45:32.992
- Lay her in the earth.

01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:35.227
(mumbling)

01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:37.063
- What, the fair Ophelia?

01:45:37.065 --> 01:45:39.665
- [Laertes] May violets spring.

01:45:44.739 --> 01:45:46.605
- Sweets to the sweet.

01:45:47.642 --> 01:45:48.507
Farewell.

01:45:51.946 --> 01:45:54.480
I hoped thou shouldst have
been my Hamlet's wife.

01:45:54.482 --> 01:45:57.016
I thought thy bride
bed to have decked,

01:45:57.018 --> 01:45:59.719
sweet maid, and not
have strewed thy grave.

01:45:59.721 --> 01:46:02.555
- Oh treble woe,
fall 10 times treble

01:46:02.557 --> 01:46:05.691
on that cursed head
whose wicked deed

01:46:05.693 --> 01:46:08.928
thy most ingenious
sense deprived thee of.

01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:10.830
Hold off the earth awhile

01:46:10.832 --> 01:46:13.532
till I have once more
held her in mine arms.

01:46:17.772 --> 01:46:19.105
(crying)

01:46:19.107 --> 01:46:20.973
- What is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis,

01:46:20.975 --> 01:46:24.877
whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars

01:46:24.879 --> 01:46:28.647
and makes them stand like
wonder wounded hearers?

01:46:28.649 --> 01:46:31.150
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.

01:46:33.254 --> 01:46:34.453
- The devil take thy soul.

01:46:34.455 --> 01:46:35.654
- Thou prayest not well.

01:46:35.656 --> 01:46:37.690
I prithee take thy
fingers from my throat.

01:46:37.692 --> 01:46:38.924
(mumbling)

01:46:38.926 --> 01:46:40.526
- Hamlet.
- [Horatio] Good
my lord, be quiet.

01:46:40.528 --> 01:46:42.128
- I loved Ophelia.

01:46:42.130 --> 01:46:44.397
40,000 brothers could not
with all their quantity

01:46:44.399 --> 01:46:46.132
of love make up my sum.

01:46:46.134 --> 01:46:47.733
What wilt thou do for her?

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:49.268
- Oh, for the love
of God, forbear him.

01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:50.569
- Show me what thou will do.

01:46:50.571 --> 01:46:53.172
Would weep, would
fight, would fast,

01:46:53.174 --> 01:46:55.574
would tear thyself,
would drink up esill,

01:46:55.576 --> 01:46:57.276
eat a crocodile?

01:46:57.278 --> 01:46:58.544
I'll rant as well as thou.

01:46:58.546 --> 01:46:59.812
- This is mere madness.

01:46:59.814 --> 01:47:01.914
- What is the reason
that you use me thus?

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:03.182
I loved you ever,

01:47:04.152 --> 01:47:06.352
(birds cawing)

01:47:06.354 --> 01:47:08.154
but it is no matter.

01:47:08.156 --> 01:47:09.989
Let Hercules himself
do what he may.

01:47:09.991 --> 01:47:13.192
The cat will mew, and
dog will have his day.

01:47:13.194 --> 01:47:16.996
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:47:21.702 --> 01:47:24.069
- Why, what a king is this?

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.441
- Does it not, think
thee, stand me now upon.

01:47:28.443 --> 01:47:31.210
He that hath killed my
king and whored my mother,

01:47:31.212 --> 01:47:33.446
popped in between the
election and my hopes,

01:47:33.448 --> 01:47:36.515
thrown out his angle
for my proper life,

01:47:36.517 --> 01:47:37.850
and with such cosenage,

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.221
is it not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm,

01:47:42.223 --> 01:47:44.323
and is not to be damned to let

01:47:44.325 --> 01:47:46.892
this canker of our nature
come in further evil?

01:47:48.262 --> 01:47:49.862
- It must shortly be
known to him from England

01:47:49.864 --> 01:47:51.931
what is the issue of
the business there.

01:47:51.933 --> 01:47:52.932
- It will be short.

01:47:54.569 --> 01:47:57.203
The interim is mine,

01:47:57.205 --> 01:47:59.405
and a man's life no
more than to say one,

01:47:59.407 --> 01:48:02.208
(wind blowing)

01:48:03.244 --> 01:48:05.277
but I am very
sorry, good Horatio,

01:48:05.279 --> 01:48:07.813
that to Laertes I forgot myself,

01:48:07.815 --> 01:48:09.849
but sure, the
bravery of his grief

01:48:09.851 --> 01:48:12.251
did put me into a
towering passion.

01:48:12.253 --> 01:48:13.385
(wood knocking)

01:48:13.387 --> 01:48:14.220
- Peace.

01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:16.555
Who comes here?

01:48:16.557 --> 01:48:18.657
- [Osric] Your Lordship is
right welcome back to Denmark.

01:48:18.659 --> 01:48:20.059
- I humbly thank you, sir.

01:48:20.061 --> 01:48:21.260
Dost know this water fly?

01:48:21.262 --> 01:48:22.862
- No, my good lord.

01:48:22.864 --> 01:48:24.597
- Sweet lord, if your
lordship were at leisure,

01:48:24.599 --> 01:48:27.466
I should impart a thing
to you from his Majesty.

01:48:27.468 --> 01:48:30.769
- I will receive it, sir,
with all diligence of spirit.

01:48:30.771 --> 01:48:32.972
- Sir, here is newly
come to court Laertes,

01:48:32.974 --> 01:48:34.240
believe me, an
absolute gentleman,

01:48:34.242 --> 01:48:35.774
full of most
excellent differences,

01:48:35.776 --> 01:48:38.477
of very soft society
and great showing.

01:48:38.479 --> 01:48:41.814
- Why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rarer breath?

01:48:41.816 --> 01:48:43.215
- Sir?

01:48:43.217 --> 01:48:44.850
- What imports the
nomination of this gentleman?

01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:45.784
- Of Laertes?

01:48:45.786 --> 01:48:46.719
- Of him, sir.

01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:48.654
- I know you are not ignorant--

01:48:48.656 --> 01:48:50.222
- I would you did, sir,

01:48:50.224 --> 01:48:53.792
yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much approve me.

01:48:53.794 --> 01:48:55.394
Well, sir?

01:48:55.396 --> 01:48:57.897
- You are not ignorant of
what excellence Laertes is--

01:48:57.899 --> 01:48:59.198
- I dare not confess that,

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:01.400
lest I should compare
with him in excellence,

01:49:01.402 --> 01:49:05.137
but to know a man well
were to know himself.

01:49:05.139 --> 01:49:07.139
- I mean, sir, for his weapon.

01:49:07.141 --> 01:49:08.007
- What's his weapon?

01:49:08.009 --> 01:49:09.308
- Rapier and dagger.

01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:12.077
- That's two of his
weapons, but well--

01:49:12.079 --> 01:49:13.512
- The King, sir, hath laid, sir,

01:49:13.514 --> 01:49:16.148
that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him,

01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:17.650
he shall not exceed
you three hits.

01:49:17.652 --> 01:49:19.251
He hath laid on 12 for nine,

01:49:19.253 --> 01:49:20.452
and it would come
to immediate trial

01:49:20.454 --> 01:49:22.755
if your lordship would
vouchsafe the answer.

01:49:23.925 --> 01:49:26.759
- Sir, I will walk
here in the hall.

01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:28.427
If it please his Majesty,

01:49:28.429 --> 01:49:30.829
it is the breathing
time of day with me.

01:49:30.831 --> 01:49:32.498
Let the foils be brought.

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.667
The gentleman willing, and
the King hold his purpose,

01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:36.468
I will win for him, and I can.

01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:38.337
If not, I will gain nothing

01:49:38.339 --> 01:49:40.639
but my shame and the odd hits.

01:49:41.676 --> 01:49:44.543
- Shall I deliver you even so?

01:49:44.545 --> 01:49:48.314
- To this effect, after what
flourish your nature will.

01:49:55.690 --> 01:50:00.759
- (mumbling) I commend
my duty to your Lordship.

01:50:03.097 --> 01:50:03.996
- Yours.

01:50:03.998 --> 01:50:04.863
- Hm?

01:50:08.135 --> 01:50:11.804
(gentle instrumental music)

01:50:13.808 --> 01:50:14.940
- You will lose, my lord.

01:50:14.942 --> 01:50:16.442
- I do not think so.

01:50:17.311 --> 01:50:18.744
Since he went into France,

01:50:18.746 --> 01:50:21.580
I have been in
continual practice.

01:50:21.582 --> 01:50:22.881
I shall win at the odds,

01:50:26.354 --> 01:50:27.419
but thou wouldst not think

01:50:27.421 --> 01:50:29.188
how ill all's here
about my heart,

01:50:31.692 --> 01:50:32.691
but it is no matter.

01:50:32.693 --> 01:50:33.592
- Nay, good my lord--

01:50:33.594 --> 01:50:34.827
- It is but foolery,

01:50:34.829 --> 01:50:36.128
but it is such a
kind of gain giving

01:50:36.130 --> 01:50:37.496
as would perhaps
trouble a woman.

01:50:37.498 --> 01:50:40.232
- If your mind dislike
anything, obey it.

01:50:40.234 --> 01:50:41.433
I will forestall
their repair hither

01:50:41.435 --> 01:50:42.534
and say you are not fit.

01:50:42.536 --> 01:50:43.402
- Not a whit.

01:50:44.538 --> 01:50:46.005
We defy augury.

01:50:49.176 --> 01:50:51.977
There is a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

01:50:54.548 --> 01:50:57.750
If it be now, 'tis not to come.

01:50:57.752 --> 01:50:59.518
If it be not to
come, it will be now.

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.621
If it be not now,
yet it will come.

01:51:03.457 --> 01:51:04.690
The readiness is all.

01:51:06.827 --> 01:51:08.727
Since no man of aught
he leaves knows,

01:51:09.797 --> 01:51:11.330
what is it to leave betimes?

01:51:15.469 --> 01:51:16.235
Let be.

01:51:17.438 --> 01:51:21.306
(gentle instrumental music)

01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:29.581
- [Claudius] Come, Hamlet.

01:51:29.583 --> 01:51:32.251
Come and take this hand from me.

01:51:34.789 --> 01:51:37.456
(heart beating)

01:51:47.668 --> 01:51:50.436
(gravel crunching)

01:51:50.438 --> 01:51:52.471
- Give me your pardon, sir.
I have done you wrong,

01:51:52.473 --> 01:51:54.506
but pardon't, as
you are a gentleman.

01:51:55.876 --> 01:51:56.809
This presence knows,

01:51:56.811 --> 01:51:58.410
and you must needs have heard,

01:51:58.412 --> 01:52:00.579
how I am punished with
a sore distraction.

01:52:01.515 --> 01:52:04.016
Sir, in this audience,
let my disclaiming

01:52:04.018 --> 01:52:06.251
from a purposed
evil free me so far

01:52:06.253 --> 01:52:07.686
in your most generous thoughts

01:52:07.688 --> 01:52:09.621
that I have shot my
arrow o'er the house

01:52:09.623 --> 01:52:11.523
and hurt my brother.

01:52:11.525 --> 01:52:13.492
- I am satisfied in nature,

01:52:13.494 --> 01:52:14.927
whose motive in this case

01:52:14.929 --> 01:52:16.895
should stir me
most to my revenge,

01:52:16.897 --> 01:52:20.466
but in my terms of
honor I stand aloof

01:52:20.468 --> 01:52:21.934
and will no reconcilement

01:52:21.936 --> 01:52:23.936
till by some elder
masters of known honor

01:52:23.938 --> 01:52:25.604
I have a voice and precedent

01:52:25.606 --> 01:52:27.539
of peace to keep
my name ungored.

01:52:28.542 --> 01:52:29.608
- [Hamlet] I embrace it freely,

01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:31.477
and will this brother's
wager frankly play.

01:52:31.479 --> 01:52:32.911
Give us the foils.

01:52:32.913 --> 01:52:33.712
Come on.

01:52:33.714 --> 01:52:34.646
- Come, one for me.

01:52:34.648 --> 01:52:36.515
- I'll be your foil, Laertes.

01:52:36.517 --> 01:52:38.217
In mine ignorance,
your skill shall,

01:52:38.219 --> 01:52:41.687
like a star in the darkest
night, stick fiery off indeed.

01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:43.455
- [Laertes] You mock me, sir?

01:52:43.457 --> 01:52:45.491
- No, by this hand.

01:52:45.493 --> 01:52:46.959
- You know the wager?

01:52:46.961 --> 01:52:48.293
- [Hamlet] Very well, my lord.

01:52:48.295 --> 01:52:50.696
Your Grace has laid the
odds of the weaker self.

01:52:50.698 --> 01:52:52.164
- I do not fear it.

01:52:52.166 --> 01:52:53.499
I have seen you both,

01:52:53.501 --> 01:52:55.501
but since he is better,
we have therefore odds.

01:52:56.737 --> 01:52:58.604
Now the King drinks to Hamlet.

01:53:01.642 --> 01:53:02.574
Come, begin,

01:53:04.678 --> 01:53:07.679
and you, the judges,
bear a wary eye.

01:53:07.681 --> 01:53:10.616
(metal clacking)

01:53:13.654 --> 01:53:14.520
- Come on, sir.

01:53:15.523 --> 01:53:17.256
- Come, my lord.

01:53:17.258 --> 01:53:19.691
(metal clacking)

01:53:19.693 --> 01:53:20.926
- [Hamlet] One.

01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:21.860
- [Laertes] No.

01:53:21.862 --> 01:53:22.761
- [Hamlet] Judgment.

01:53:22.763 --> 01:53:24.296
- A hit, a very palpable hit.

01:53:24.298 --> 01:53:25.097
(clapping)

01:53:25.099 --> 01:53:26.064
- Well, again.

01:53:26.066 --> 01:53:27.699
- Stay.

01:53:27.701 --> 01:53:31.336
Hamlet, this pearl is thine.

01:53:33.407 --> 01:53:34.540
Here's to thy health.

01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:37.476
Give him the cup.

01:53:37.478 --> 01:53:39.678
- I'll play this bout first.
Set it by awhile.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.546
Come.

01:53:41.916 --> 01:53:43.148
- [Horatio] Halt.

01:53:43.150 --> 01:53:45.551
(metal clattering)

01:53:45.553 --> 01:53:46.885
(grunting)

01:53:46.887 --> 01:53:48.353
- [Hamlet] Another hit.

01:53:48.355 --> 01:53:49.521
- A touch.

01:53:49.523 --> 01:53:51.590
A touch, I do confess it.

01:53:51.592 --> 01:53:52.724
- [Claudius] Our son shall win.

01:53:52.726 --> 01:53:54.026
- He's fat and scant of breath.

01:53:54.028 --> 01:53:55.794
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin.

01:53:55.796 --> 01:53:57.162
Rub thy brow.

01:53:57.164 --> 01:53:58.297
(gentle instrumental music)

01:53:58.299 --> 01:54:01.066
(birds chirping)

01:54:02.236 --> 01:54:05.437
The Queen carouses to
thy fortune, Hamlet.

01:54:05.439 --> 01:54:07.139
- [Hamlet] Good madam.

01:54:07.141 --> 01:54:08.006
- Gertrude.

01:54:10.177 --> 01:54:11.043
Do not drink.

01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:14.012
- I will, my lord.

01:54:14.014 --> 01:54:15.747
I pray you pardon me.

01:54:15.749 --> 01:54:19.585
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:54:21.222 --> 01:54:23.355
- I dare not drink
yet madam, by and by.

01:54:23.357 --> 01:54:26.058
- Come, let me wipe thy face.

01:54:31.599 --> 01:54:33.832
- My lord, I'll hit him now.
- [Claudius] I do not think it.

01:54:33.834 --> 01:54:35.534
- Come for a third, Laertes.

01:54:35.536 --> 01:54:36.635
You do but dally.

01:54:36.637 --> 01:54:38.537
I pray you pass with
your best violence.

01:54:38.539 --> 01:54:40.339
I am afeard you
make a wanton of me.

01:54:40.341 --> 01:54:41.540
- Say you so?

01:54:41.542 --> 01:54:45.410
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:54:50.417 --> 01:54:51.416
(metal clattering)

01:54:51.418 --> 01:54:53.619
(grunting)

01:54:59.093 --> 01:55:00.626
- [Horatio] Nothing neither way.

01:55:05.799 --> 01:55:06.798
- Have at you now.

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:08.066
(yelling)

01:55:08.068 --> 01:55:10.335
(gasping)

01:55:11.572 --> 01:55:13.672
(grunting)

01:55:13.674 --> 01:55:14.473
- [Claudius] Part them.

01:55:14.475 --> 01:55:15.374
They are incensed.

01:55:16.777 --> 01:55:18.176
- Nay, come again.

01:55:20.614 --> 01:55:21.680
- Look to the Queen there, ho.

01:55:21.682 --> 01:55:23.815
- [Horatio] They
bleed on both sides.

01:55:23.817 --> 01:55:25.050
How is it, my lord?

01:55:25.052 --> 01:55:26.652
- I am justly slain
with mine own treachery.

01:55:26.654 --> 01:55:28.186
- [Hamlet] How does the Queen?

01:55:28.188 --> 01:55:31.023
- She swoons to see them bleed.

01:55:31.025 --> 01:55:33.492
(vomiting)

01:55:34.395 --> 01:55:36.061
- No, no, the drink,

01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:38.497
the drink.

01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:41.400
Oh my dear Hamlet, the drink.

01:55:41.402 --> 01:55:44.002
The drink, I am poisoned.

01:55:44.004 --> 01:55:45.203
- Oh, villainy.

01:55:45.205 --> 01:55:46.471
Oh, treachery.

01:55:47.508 --> 01:55:50.275
- Hamlet, thou art slain.

01:55:50.277 --> 01:55:53.478
No medicine in the
world can do thee good.

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.948
The King, the King's to blame.

01:55:57.051 --> 01:56:00.018
(gravel crunching)

01:56:02.122 --> 01:56:02.988
- Here.

01:56:04.325 --> 01:56:05.624
(birds cawing)

01:56:05.626 --> 01:56:06.892
Thou incestuous,

01:56:08.562 --> 01:56:09.428
murderous,

01:56:11.865 --> 01:56:12.731
damned

01:56:13.934 --> 01:56:15.367
Dane.

01:56:15.369 --> 01:56:17.703
(groaning)

01:56:20.741 --> 01:56:22.274
(yelling)

01:56:22.276 --> 01:56:24.309
Drink of this potion.

01:56:24.311 --> 01:56:26.912
(birds cawing)

01:56:28.782 --> 01:56:30.248
Is thy union here?

01:56:34.788 --> 01:56:35.721
Follow my mother.

01:56:38.092 --> 01:56:41.760
(gentle instrumental music)

01:56:45.499 --> 01:56:47.599
- Exchange forgiveness
with me, noble Hamlet.

01:56:50.004 --> 01:56:52.771
Mine and my father's
death come not upon thee,

01:56:52.773 --> 01:56:55.507
nor thine on me.

01:56:55.509 --> 01:56:58.176
(metal clattering)

01:56:58.178 --> 01:57:00.846
- Heaven make thee free of it.

01:57:03.517 --> 01:57:04.850
I follow thee.

01:57:35.749 --> 01:57:38.016
(groaning)

01:57:39.453 --> 01:57:41.053
I am dead, Horatio.

01:57:43.791 --> 01:57:47.826
(laughing) I could tell you,

01:57:50.397 --> 01:57:51.663
but let it be.

01:57:53.367 --> 01:57:54.199
Horatio.

01:57:57.404 --> 01:57:58.270
I am dead.

01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:00.806
Thou livest.

01:58:02.943 --> 01:58:05.877
Report me and my cause
aright to the unsatisfied.

01:58:05.879 --> 01:58:07.479
- Never believe it.

01:58:07.481 --> 01:58:08.847
Here's yet some liquor left.

01:58:08.849 --> 01:58:09.881
- Art a man, give me the cup.

01:58:09.883 --> 01:58:11.249
Let go, by heaven.

01:58:11.985 --> 01:58:14.486
(wind blowing)

01:58:14.488 --> 01:58:16.088
(gentle instrumental music)

01:58:16.090 --> 01:58:17.422
(panting)

01:58:17.424 --> 01:58:20.892
If thou didst ever
hold me in thy heart,

01:58:21.962 --> 01:58:24.563
absent thee from
felicity awhile,

01:58:28.635 --> 01:58:29.634
and in this

01:58:31.572 --> 01:58:32.871
harsh world draw thy breath

01:58:32.873 --> 01:58:34.873
in pain to tell my story.

01:58:35.809 --> 01:58:38.577
(birds chirping)

01:58:39.413 --> 01:58:41.179
The rest is silence.

01:58:49.823 --> 01:58:51.056
(crying)

01:58:51.525 --> 01:58:52.257
O

01:58:53.393 --> 01:58:55.861
(gentle instrumental music)

01:59:00.701 --> 01:59:01.967
Oh.

01:59:05.305 --> 01:59:06.538
Oh.

01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:11.176
Oh.

01:59:24.658 --> 01:59:27.425
(metal rattling)

02:00:08.902 --> 02:00:09.701
(metal thudding)

02:00:09.703 --> 02:00:11.002
(car engine running)

02:00:11.004 --> 02:00:13.972
- [Horatio] Now
cracks a noble heart.

02:00:16.343 --> 02:00:18.376
Good night, sweet prince,

02:00:20.013 --> 02:00:23.148
and flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest.

02:00:32.926 --> 02:00:35.694
(birds chirping)

02:00:45.339 --> 02:00:48.073
(wind blowing)

02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:25.277
(bell ringing)
