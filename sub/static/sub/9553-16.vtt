Oh, look how dark it is!

01:34.510 --> 01:36.350
Oh, Mom, please,
can't I order this one?

01:36.350 --> 01:40.100
Joanie, you're a little young
for Midnight Passion.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.470
Mmm, but Mom,

01:42.470 --> 01:44.970
this will make me older
a lot faster.

01:46.770 --> 01:49.530
Marion, Fonzie left his bike
in the driveway again.

01:49.530 --> 01:52.030
There are a whole bunch of cars
parked in front of the house.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.030
I had to park my--
hi, ladies.

01:55.030 --> 01:57.030
Well, Howard!

01:57.030 --> 01:58.820
What are you doing
home so early?

01:58.820 --> 02:00.570
It's 5:30, Marion.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.070
Oh, my goodness, it is!

02:02.570 --> 02:04.570
Oh, please, you don't have
to hurry off on my account.

02:04.570 --> 02:06.330
(softly):
Get rid of them,
will you, Marion?

02:07.630 --> 02:10.130
The time just seemed
to have slipped away.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.000
Oh, do you all
have to rush off so quickly?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.670
MARION:
Good-bye ladies.

02:15.670 --> 02:17.970
Marion, do you realize
I've got to make a speech

02:17.970 --> 02:18.970
at the lodge
meeting tonight?

02:19.470 --> 02:20.470
I forgot.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.340
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I got so involved...

02:22.340 --> 02:25.150
But why on the night
of the lodge meeting?

02:25.150 --> 02:26.560
I'll start your dinner.
(groans)

02:27.010 --> 02:30.070
PlastoWare sales,
rummage garage sales...

02:30.570 --> 02:32.020
I am tired of coming
home and finding

02:32.570 --> 02:35.020
strange people
in my house!

02:36.910 --> 02:39.110
My friends
aren't strange.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.030
Marion?

02:44.030 --> 02:45.370
What?

02:45.370 --> 02:47.780
Who's the Creature
from the Black Lagoon?

02:49.620 --> 02:51.120
Oh, your mud pack
looks good.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.120
That'll tighten
up your face.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.590
The girls have left.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.120
You can catch a ride
if you'll hurry.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.630
Don't say a word.

02:58.630 --> 02:59.960
I'm tired of finding

02:59.960 --> 03:01.260
these people in my house!

03:01.260 --> 03:02.770
Last week, I came home,

03:02.770 --> 03:04.770
this fat lady grabs me
by the throat,

03:04.770 --> 03:07.050
throws me on the couch
and sits on me.

03:08.810 --> 03:12.310
She was a policewoman
teaching us self defense.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.310
Oh, who cares?

03:14.310 --> 03:15.780
When I come home,
I'm, I'm tired.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.200
I want peace and quiet.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.530
I know.
You come in,

03:18.530 --> 03:19.950
read the paper
and grumble for an hour.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.370
Well, I get cranky
from working all day.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.370
Well, I can get
cranky, too.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.370
Hi, I'm home.

03:25.370 --> 03:27.320
Who cares?

03:31.880 --> 03:33.880
Will you tell me what's
happening to you, Marion?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.380
Let's not fight in front
of the C-H-I-L-D-R...

03:36.880 --> 03:37.750
They can spell.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.140
They're fighting, Richie.

03:40.140 --> 03:41.140
(arguing continues)
I know.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.640
Whenever Mom starts spelling,

03:42.640 --> 03:44.640
they're either having a fight
or they're getting frisky.

03:46.510 --> 03:49.400
Oh, Howard, I don't
know what's happening.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.900
I'm just...
I'm so frustrated.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.400
Richard is a senior,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.350
and Joanie is
starting high school.

03:55.350 --> 03:57.400
I just don't have
enough to do.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.410
Well, that's good,
because then you'll have time

03:59.410 --> 04:01.410
to do what you're supposed
to do: take care of me.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.910
I've been doing
that for 21 years,

04:03.910 --> 04:06.330
and really, it's not
much of a challenge.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.620
I was thinking that
maybe I should get a job.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.620
Oh, did you hear?
Did you hear?

04:14.620 --> 04:16.370
We heard.
We heard.

04:16.370 --> 04:18.680
Oh, here we go again.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.180
You've got a job, Marion.

04:20.180 --> 04:20.959
You give piano lessons.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.800
I teach beginners.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.800
I never studied
music seriously.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.800
As soon as they learn
"Chopsticks,"

04:26.800 --> 04:28.220
they go to somebody else.
Oh, now listen,

04:28.220 --> 04:30.640
we have been over this job
business a million times

04:30.640 --> 04:33.020
and we decided
that it's out of the question.

04:33.020 --> 04:34.390
You decided!

04:34.390 --> 04:35.390
Same thing.

04:35.890 --> 04:37.390
It's out of the question.

04:37.390 --> 04:39.810
You get a job, and people
think I need the money.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.700
No. I'm going up
and wash up.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.700
Hi, Dad.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.200
Joanie,
when Richie gets home,

04:45.200 --> 04:47.700
tell him to get Fonzie's bike
out of the driveway.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.210
(laughs)

04:49.210 --> 04:50.710
I'll tell him.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.210
Hey, quit kidding around.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.210
This is pretty serious.

04:55.210 --> 04:56.080
He seems kind of upset.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Dad, your hat collapsed.

05:05.340 --> 05:07.090
What's the matter with you?

05:07.090 --> 05:08.930
Don't you say "hello"
anymore when you come home?

05:08.930 --> 05:10.230
Hi, Dad.

05:12.650 --> 05:15.150
Marion...
Howard, don't start.

05:15.150 --> 05:16.650
Now, I know we've
discussed this before,

05:16.650 --> 05:19.650
and I know you disapprove,
but I really feel

05:19.650 --> 05:21.150
that I should get a job.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.110
Don't bother applying
at a hat shop.

05:27.110 --> 05:30.530
Howard, why is your fez limp?

05:33.750 --> 05:36.200
I found it in a basket
of clean laundry.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.750
Oh, that's why it collapsed.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.760
It must have gotten
mixed up in the wash.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.260
Of all the harebrained,
irresponsible...

05:41.260 --> 05:42.210
Harebrained?!

05:42.210 --> 05:44.090
I've got to be at
a meeting in half an hour,

05:44.090 --> 05:46.600
and I don't have any dinner,
and I've got a limp fez!

05:48.100 --> 05:49.600
"Marion do this,
Marion do that."

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
You want your dinner?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.940
I'll get your dinner.
You've got it.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.850
I'll get your dinner.
I've done it a thousand times.

05:54.850 --> 05:57.360
I can do it with
my eyes closed.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.360
Here is your salad,

06:00.360 --> 06:03.360
your vegetable,
your meat!

06:03.360 --> 06:04.860
Live it up!

06:12.570 --> 06:14.410
All right, a little more
to the left.

06:14.410 --> 06:15.410
A little more to the left.

06:15.910 --> 06:17.410
Oh, no, now, slide it
to the right.

06:17.410 --> 06:18.910
Slide it to the right.

06:18.910 --> 06:20.910
Oh, have you got talent.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.640
(knocking)
Arthur?

06:25.640 --> 06:27.640
Oh, it's chilly.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.590
Would you mind if I
just warmed up a little bit?

06:30.590 --> 06:32.090
Hey, be my guest.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.340
My place is your place,
especially since you own it.

06:34.340 --> 06:37.150
(laughs, cries)

06:37.150 --> 06:38.060
Oh, hey.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.520
Hey, Mrs. C.,

06:39.520 --> 06:41.020
cool the waterworks.

06:41.020 --> 06:43.020
I mean, you locked yourself
out again, it's all right,

06:43.020 --> 06:45.520
but you don't got
to cry about that.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.990
Howard's mad, no
dinner, limp fez...

06:51.030 --> 06:55.530
He thinks I'm a slave.

06:55.530 --> 06:58.000
Oh, Mrs. C., huh?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.200
That's terrible.

07:00.200 --> 07:00.950
(sniffs)

07:01.500 --> 07:02.510
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

07:03.010 --> 07:05.370
Oh, I'm leaving, I-I
thought you were alone.

07:05.370 --> 07:07.710
This is, uh, Lorraine.
Hi.

07:07.710 --> 07:09.680
Oh, hello.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.680
I usually don't cry
in front of people

07:12.180 --> 07:13.180
until I know them.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.140
Oh...

07:16.140 --> 07:18.140
Don't you dare apologize.

07:18.140 --> 07:19.640
It's all right, and I want
to tell you something.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.140
You know I like Mr. C.,
but he don't have the right

07:22.140 --> 07:23.980
to think that
you're his slave.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.650
That's beautiful.

07:25.650 --> 07:26.480
Thanks a lot, right here.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.480
I'm a little tense
right here.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.900
I'm thinking
of getting a job.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.370
That's a wonderful idea.

07:32.370 --> 07:33.870
There are a lot of opportunities
out there for you.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.120
You went to college.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.410
Well, that was 20 years ago.

07:37.410 --> 07:39.380
I majored in archaeology.

07:39.910 --> 07:41.830
Milwaukee doesn't have
a lot of ruins.

07:41.830 --> 07:44.050
Yeah, a little higher
on the shoulders.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.380
I look in the want ads.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.880
They don't care about college.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.750
All they care about is
can you type.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.640
There are a lot of jobs
out there for you.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.640
You think so?

07:51.640 --> 07:53.470
I know so.
Really?

07:53.470 --> 07:55.810
Who knows more
about women than the Fonz?

07:55.810 --> 07:57.810
Nobody.
Aaayyh.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.230
You're right.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.230
There are a lot of jobs
other than typing.

08:02.230 --> 08:05.230
Could Amelia Earhart type?

08:05.230 --> 08:06.240
Or Margaret Truman?

08:06.240 --> 08:07.740
Or Betty Crocker?

08:07.740 --> 08:09.520
Or Gypsy Rose Lee?

08:09.520 --> 08:12.190
Mrs. C...

08:12.190 --> 08:15.080
Well, you know
what I mean.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.580
Oh, you've given me
new hope, Arthur.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.580
Hey, that's what
I'm here for.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.040
Thank you, Arthur.
All right.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.340
You know, I didn't want
to pop her bubble,

08:30.340 --> 08:32.710
but Betty Crocker
was a heck of a typist.

08:37.770 --> 08:39.270
I can't figure out
what happened.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.270
Rich, I'm going crazy.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.770
Look, just tell Brenda

08:41.770 --> 08:43.270
to tell her sister
to go out with me again.

08:43.270 --> 08:44.770
I don't think
she wants to, Malph.

08:44.770 --> 08:45.780
I don't understand.

08:45.780 --> 08:47.190
So we ran out of gas.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.400
But right in front
of the Cloud Nine Motel?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.200
(laughs)

08:51.200 --> 08:53.200
Obvious, Malph,
very obvious.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.200
Yeah, maybe you're right.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.650
Richie,
I got to talk to you.

08:55.650 --> 08:57.650
Not now.
Look at this table.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.660
Yeah, let's get our
waitress over here.
Richie!

09:00.040 --> 09:01.570
Waitress, waitress,
come on, we're starving here.

09:01.960 --> 09:02.990
Yeah, let's get
our waitress, please.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.460
(boys clamoring)

09:05.460 --> 09:07.250
Hi, kids,
you want to order?

09:11.500 --> 09:13.470
Mom!

09:19.840 --> 09:21.340
Brenda has to go,
I'll see you later.

09:21.340 --> 09:22.350
I mean, I'm staying.

09:22.350 --> 09:23.850
She has to go,
but I'm staying...

09:23.850 --> 09:25.350
Will you just
order me something?

09:25.350 --> 09:26.850
Okay, okay.
Yeah.

09:27.350 --> 09:29.350
Let's see, let me
order something here.

09:29.350 --> 09:31.850
Marion, you know,
you're doing just great!

09:31.850 --> 09:33.360
But could you do it
a little faster?

09:33.360 --> 09:34.860
The food's stacking up
on the counter.

09:34.860 --> 09:36.360
Oh, certainly.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
I'll-I'll be right back
to get your order.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.360
Oh, it's so busy here.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.360
I just love it!

09:43.370 --> 09:44.870
I have to talk
to my mother.

09:44.870 --> 09:46.870
I'll see you
tomorrow in class.

09:46.870 --> 09:48.870
Oh, Brenda, Mom's
looking at you.

09:48.870 --> 09:50.870
Cave in a little bit.

09:56.380 --> 09:57.380
Has anybody else
spotted Mom?

09:57.380 --> 09:59.380
Everybody!
(sighs)

09:59.380 --> 10:01.380
Hardware business
that bad?

10:01.380 --> 10:02.800
No, business
has been great.

10:03.190 --> 10:04.770
Kids are always
the last to know.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.270
Okay, Rich,
come on, give.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.770
Now, how come your
Mom's a waitress?

10:07.770 --> 10:08.690
Folks have a fight?

10:09.060 --> 10:09.940
You told them?

10:10.190 --> 10:11.280
A fight? Really?

10:11.280 --> 10:12.140
Did they throw things?

10:12.450 --> 10:14.530
No, it was just
a little argument.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.870
All parents have arguments.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.200
Yeah, well, this must
have been a doozy.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.700
Your mother went
out and got a job.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.700
Howie wouldn't spring
for the alimony.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.160
Boy, is Howie a cheapo.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.630
All right, all right--
cut it out.

10:26.630 --> 10:28.130
I'm going to settle
this once and for all.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.500
Mom?

10:29.880 --> 10:30.460
Yes, dear?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.470
I mean, uh,
waitress, miss...

10:33.470 --> 10:34.970
Oh, are you
ready to order?

10:34.970 --> 10:36.470
We'll order in a minute.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.510
Mom, does Dad know
you're doing this?

10:39.760 --> 10:42.340
Well, I thought I would wear
my uniform home tonight

10:42.340 --> 10:43.730
and see if he notices.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.650
He'll notice.

10:45.650 --> 10:47.650
Look, I know
you want to work,

10:48.150 --> 10:48.980
but what are
you doing here?

10:49.270 --> 10:51.350
I was turned down 40 times.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.770
This is the only job I was
qualified for.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.660
I'll tell you
all about it later.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.160
We're so busy.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.160
Would you like to order?

10:59.160 --> 11:00.160
Now, some milk?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.660
Oh, no, no, no,
we'll take the usual.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.610
Uh, cheeseburgers,
large order of fries,

11:04.610 --> 11:06.170
chocolate malts,
right, Rich?

11:06.170 --> 11:08.170
Oh, Richard, Joanie,

11:08.170 --> 11:10.170
Tonight I'm fixing steak
and potatoes,

11:10.170 --> 11:13.170
and your favorite dessert:
a big bowl of raisins.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.090
A big bowl of raisins?
A big bowl of raisins?

11:19.960 --> 11:21.960
All right, all right, so I
like raisins for dessert.

11:22.470 --> 11:23.430
Do you have to tell
the whole world?

11:24.930 --> 11:27.390
All this eating
in between meals...
Mom.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.810
Uh, I think we'd better
sit over there, Rich.

11:29.810 --> 11:31.690
It's a little crowded here.
Yeah.

11:31.970 --> 11:35.390
And, Richard, dear,
I'm surprised at you.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.730
Coming right before dinner
and filling up on garbage.

11:38.730 --> 11:41.230
Garbage?

11:41.230 --> 11:42.650
Just a figure of speech.

11:42.990 --> 11:46.070
That's a word we don't use
in the restaurant business.

11:46.070 --> 11:47.570
You're supposed
to sell the food,

11:47.570 --> 11:48.910
not talk them out of it.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.740
And, Al, this menu
is a disgrace.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.250
There's nothing
wrong with the menu.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.250
It's got a little grease
spot on it, ketchup,

11:55.250 --> 11:56.250
but the kids can
still read it.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.750
No, the selections
of fried foods

11:58.750 --> 12:00.250
and these greasy things.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.250
Do you know
what this does

12:01.250 --> 12:02.720
to Joanie's complexion?

12:03.760 --> 12:06.260
I think I'll disappear.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.230
Al, if you just
provided a balanced diet

12:08.560 --> 12:11.150
for these children...
Marion, you're...

12:11.150 --> 12:13.400
doing just fine.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.770

Now" playing on jukebox)

12:18.350 --> 12:21.360
♪ Who's sorry now? ♪

12:25.360 --> 12:27.280
Hey, Cunningham,
you ever meet Lorraine?

12:27.610 --> 12:28.610
I don't have time
right now, Fonz.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.330
Whoa!
RICHIE:
Oh.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.120
Sorry. It's very
nice meeting you.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.120
I got a
real problem.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.620
Yeah?
What is it?

12:34.620 --> 12:36.620
My mom is working
as a waitress.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.120
Hey, that's fabulous.
Where?

12:38.120 --> 12:39.630
Here at Arnold's.

12:39.630 --> 12:41.130
Isn't that great?

12:41.130 --> 12:42.630
Here at Arnold's.

12:42.630 --> 12:44.630
All this
and tips, too.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.140
You know, it's not
so cool, Fonz.
Huh?

12:49.140 --> 12:51.050
It's really going
to cramp my style.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.470
What style?

12:55.720 --> 12:57.810
Arthur, Lorraine.

12:57.810 --> 13:01.810
Mrs. C., you look wonderful
in that outfit.

13:01.810 --> 13:04.280
Would you like to order?

13:04.650 --> 13:06.070
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.700
He likes vegetables and milk.

13:08.870 --> 13:11.290
What would you
like, Lorraine?

13:13.880 --> 13:16.380
I'll have a large cheeseburger
with everything on it

13:16.380 --> 13:17.830
and a chocolate malt.

13:18.210 --> 13:19.170
Arthur?

13:19.500 --> 13:20.580
Yeah, I'll have the same

13:20.580 --> 13:21.920
with a side order of relish.

13:22.170 --> 13:23.250
Oh, me.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.750
Arthur, that's not good for you.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.670
You're getting
those little ringies under

13:28.010 --> 13:29.590
your eyes again.

13:30.090 --> 13:31.480
What are you talking about?

13:31.730 --> 13:32.680
You know, bags.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.060
Mrs. C.

13:34.430 --> 13:36.430
That's what you get,
dating three girls last night.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.320
You're all worn out.

13:42.270 --> 13:44.160
Uh, Mrs. C...

13:44.410 --> 13:45.990
Uh, three dates?

13:45.990 --> 13:48.360
Fonzie, I thought
we were going steady this week.

13:48.690 --> 13:49.780
Hey, Lorraine, we are.

13:49.780 --> 13:51.280
What are you talking about?

13:51.280 --> 13:52.200
You're my heart.

13:52.530 --> 13:54.620
Oh, if he says you are,
you are.

13:54.620 --> 13:57.120
Uh, two of those girls
were mechanics.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.040
I don't know
what the other one was.

13:59.420 --> 14:02.460
I thought I was
something special, Fonzie.

14:02.790 --> 14:04.380
Lorraine,
you're special.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.880
I'll see you
in the parking lot, right?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.380
Hey, you're so cute.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.380
You know,
you're great, Mrs. C.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.890
Listen up! There's a meeting
in my office right now!

14:13.300 --> 14:15.390
RICHIE:
Al, you better come, too.

14:15.390 --> 14:17.140
AL:
Is something wrong
with the pipes?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.530
Will I need my plunger?
POTSIE:
There's just one thing.

14:19.530 --> 14:21.440
I don't care if she is
your mother. I'm not tipping.

14:21.780 --> 14:23.360
That's terrible!
That's terrible.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.360
How is she going to support
two kids if nobody tips?

14:25.870 --> 14:29.370
Ralph, for the last
time, my parents are
not splitting up.

14:29.370 --> 14:30.870
I don't believe you.
I know they are.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.740
How can you say that
when you're not even

14:33.070 --> 14:34.120
living in
the house?

14:34.120 --> 14:35.410
All right, hold it!
Put a lid on it.

14:35.660 --> 14:38.240
Now, listen,
we got a little problem here.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.250
I'm sure that we can
all solve it.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.750
Yeah.
I think...

14:42.750 --> 14:45.630
that if you want
to solve this problem, I...

14:45.920 --> 14:49.000
I've always wondered
what it looked like in here.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.510
It's a lot bigger
than I thought.

14:52.510 --> 14:55.260
I think I'll just wait outside.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.560
She goes
everywhere.

14:59.060 --> 15:02.070
Yeah. Hey, Al, why did you
hire Richie's mom?

15:02.070 --> 15:03.570
She answered my ad,

15:03.570 --> 15:05.070
and I figured
she needed the money.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.570
All right, all right,
everybody listen to this.

15:07.570 --> 15:09.580
My parents have plenty
of money.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.580
Well, then, it has
to be divorce.

15:11.580 --> 15:14.080
(all talking)

15:14.080 --> 15:15.950
Hold it!!

15:16.250 --> 15:20.340
Now, look, it is very cool
that Mrs. C. wants a job.

15:20.340 --> 15:24.340
It is just not very cool
that she is working here.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.130
Now one of us has got
to ask her to leave.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.850
AL:
Oh, I can't
do that.

15:31.850 --> 15:33.630
She wouldn't
like me.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.380
I'm not good
at firing people.

15:35.380 --> 15:36.890
I'm good at hiring people,

15:36.890 --> 15:39.390
but you can't be good
at everything.

15:39.770 --> 15:41.860
I guess it's up to you,
Cunningham.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.860
Oh, you got
to be kidding.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.360
She's my mother.

15:46.860 --> 15:48.860
Fonz, look, it's
your idea. You do it.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.370
I'm sorry. I like Mrs. C.
much too much.

15:51.370 --> 15:52.370
I can't.

15:52.370 --> 15:54.870
And I don't
like my mother?

15:54.870 --> 15:56.740
How am I going
to fire my mother?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.120
No big deal.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.990
My father fired me
three times.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.290
I can't fire her, Fonz.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.830
She's going
to get upset,

16:02.830 --> 16:04.830
she's going to cry,
and carry on, and I...

16:04.830 --> 16:07.830
All right, Richie, Richie,
you don't have to fire her.

16:07.830 --> 16:09.840
Just make it so
that she wants to quit.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.800
Yeah, there
you go, Rich.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.810
It's simple.

16:12.810 --> 16:14.310
Meeting
is over.

16:14.310 --> 16:16.810
It's not simple.
I can't do it, guys. You...

16:16.810 --> 16:18.230
What?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.180
"You've been in there
a long time, Richard.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.680
"Is everything
all right?

16:23.680 --> 16:24.650
Love, Mom."

16:27.350 --> 16:29.940
I got to do this!

16:29.940 --> 16:30.910

16:39.920 --> 16:42.790
That must be a huge restroom.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.010
(clears throat)

16:50.010 --> 16:52.510
Hey, Mom, you
must be exhausted.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.010
Why don't you sit down
and take a little break?

16:54.010 --> 16:56.020
Oh, well, it has
really been a busy day.

16:56.020 --> 16:57.520
Oh, you think
this is busy?

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
Oh, this is nothing.

16:59.020 --> 17:01.020
You should see this place
after a football game.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.020
It's absolutely packed,
everybody's screaming,

17:03.020 --> 17:04.520
pounding on the
tables for service.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.030
"Give me a hot dog."

17:07.030 --> 17:08.530
"Give me a hamburger."

17:08.530 --> 17:10.030
Oh, will you
look at that?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.030
Somebody took the
top off the sugar

17:11.030 --> 17:12.530
just to drive
you crazy.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.980
It's terrible, and it's even
worse if we win the game.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.540
Oh, it sounds like such fun.
Fun?

17:17.740 --> 17:18.700
Just like when I was a kid.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.040
Mom...

17:20.040 --> 17:21.540
We used to do
the most awful...

17:22.040 --> 17:24.040
Mom, you know,
there are better jobs.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.050
I know, but I like this job.

17:26.050 --> 17:29.550
It's so much fun, and I get to
see you and Joanie so much more,

17:29.550 --> 17:31.000
to share in your lives.

17:31.330 --> 17:32.920
Oh, right.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.890
Well, excuse me.

17:34.890 --> 17:36.890
We'll share some
more in a minute.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.930
Fonz, we're in
deep trouble.

17:39.930 --> 17:41.430
It's not working.

17:41.430 --> 17:42.810
What do you mean,
it's not working?

17:43.150 --> 17:44.730
She says she
likes it here.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.570
She likes to
share my life.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.980
All right, all right,
you got to let her know

17:48.980 --> 17:50.490
that her being here
makes you uncomfortable.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.320
You know, kind of
cramps your style?

17:52.520 --> 17:53.940
Oh, I can't say
that to my mother.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.240
You're an honor student.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.740
You'll find other words. Go.

17:56.740 --> 17:58.240
All right.
Okay, Fonz.
Yeah.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.750
MARION:
Well, no, I'm sorry.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.250
I'm just not going
to order it for you.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.750
It's for your own good.

18:05.750 --> 18:06.750
Uh, excuse me.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.750
Mom, I have to share
something with you.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.260
Well, I haven't
got all day.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.260
I am a working girl,
you know.

18:12.760 --> 18:13.630
Yeah, right.
You know, Mom,

18:13.880 --> 18:15.460
uh, different generations
have a different way

18:15.460 --> 18:16.460
of-of communicating.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.960
So true.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.970
And, uh... and-and
when a member

18:19.970 --> 18:22.970
of, say, uh, the younger
generation wants to communicate

18:22.970 --> 18:24.970
with a member of
the opposite sex,

18:24.970 --> 18:27.470
well, it's a little
difficult if a
member of, uh,

18:27.470 --> 18:30.980
say, your generation, is
there at the same time.

18:31.390 --> 18:35.480
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm cramping your style?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.820
Yeah, I suppose you
could say it that way.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.070
Well, that's silly.

18:42.070 --> 18:43.620
Just do whatever
you normally do.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.070
Well, I'm
trying to, Mom.

18:45.070 --> 18:48.130
Arnold's is kind of
a hangout.

18:48.130 --> 18:49.630
That's true.

18:49.630 --> 18:51.130
Everybody comes here
after school, and...
Such fun.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.130
And there's girls here.
Well, that's true.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.130
Mom?
Yes, dear?

18:55.130 --> 18:56.000
You're fired.

18:56.340 --> 18:58.920
Richard, I don't
have time to joke.

18:58.920 --> 18:59.890
I am very busy.

19:00.260 --> 19:02.340
I'm not joking now, Mom.

19:02.340 --> 19:05.840
Al is the only one
who can fire me.

19:06.350 --> 19:08.350
Well, I was elected,

19:08.350 --> 19:11.180
because Al is no good
at firing.

19:21.030 --> 19:23.950
You're not...
You're not real upset, are you?

19:24.250 --> 19:25.830
Well, of course not.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.830
It's no big thing.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.330
Excuse me, dear.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.840
I'll just, uh,
finish my shift.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.290
I don't like
to leave things undone.

19:36.930 --> 19:38.840
Hey, Al?

19:39.040 --> 19:41.430
Now, you see how
simple that was?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.770
(Marion sobbing)

19:43.770 --> 19:45.770
(dishes clattering)

19:47.550 --> 19:50.440
Now it gets complicated.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.200
♪ La-la, la-la, la, la, la ♪

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200
♪ La, la, la. ♪

19:58.530 --> 20:01.620
Ah. No more business.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.120
You can take
off any time now.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.410
I'll pay you for the
full eight-hour shift.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.710
I said I'd work
until closing time.

20:08.710 --> 20:11.080
It's not closing time,
so get back in the kitchen.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.830
Nobody listens to me.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.750
I didn't do it.

20:35.980 --> 20:37.990
(sighs)

20:38.990 --> 20:41.490
The grill closes
in five minutes,

20:41.490 --> 20:43.990
so if you want to
order, you better hurry.

20:43.990 --> 20:45.990
I didn't come here to eat.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.500
Well, I'm on duty, so
if you want to dance,

20:48.500 --> 20:49.950
you'll have to
dance by yourself.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.420
Why are you doing this,
Marion?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.420
Because kids use
a lot of napkins.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.930
Look, I know
we had a fight yesterday,

21:00.930 --> 21:03.430
but I never thought
it would end up like this.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.930
I mean, we have lots of fights,
but we always make up.

21:06.930 --> 21:08.430
Well, this fight
was different.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.940
It was because
I was bored,

21:09.940 --> 21:11.940
and I just had to do
something, Howard.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.940
But why this?
Why here?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.440
I have no other choice.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.940
I went to an employment agency,

21:17.940 --> 21:19.950
and do you know
what they offered me?

21:19.950 --> 21:21.450
Walking a dog,

21:21.450 --> 21:23.950
sample lady
in a supermarket,

21:23.950 --> 21:24.950
or this.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.450
I can't type, Howard.

21:26.450 --> 21:27.950
I've always told
you, Marion,

21:27.950 --> 21:29.740
it's a rough world.

21:29.740 --> 21:32.540
Today I was fired by my own son.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.040
HOWARD:
He told me.

21:34.040 --> 21:37.050
Well, guess I'll go back
to cooking and cleaning.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.330
I'm a failure as a person.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.130
Oh, come on, now.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.000
You've never been a failure.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.920
You've been a wonderful mother
and a beautiful wife,

21:48.920 --> 21:52.310
and I was a fool not to listen
to you and try and help.

21:52.310 --> 21:55.180
Thank you, Howard.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.680
But it doesn't matter.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.180
I've just failed at the
only job I could get.

21:59.180 --> 22:01.520
Well, you never wanted
to be a waitress anyhow.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.360
No, I want to
teach music.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.770
Well, what's to stop you

22:05.770 --> 22:07.160
from getting
your teaching certificate?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.330
Well, I'd have to
go back to school.

22:09.330 --> 22:10.610
What's wrong with that?

22:10.610 --> 22:12.530
But, Howard,

22:13.030 --> 22:15.330
then I wouldn't have time
to take care of you.

22:15.330 --> 22:18.120
Oh.

22:18.120 --> 22:22.120
Well, I can see
it's important to you now.

22:23.130 --> 22:26.380
You think you might find
the time to make some pot roast?

22:26.380 --> 22:27.510
Every Sunday.

22:27.510 --> 22:29.770
With the little teeny potatoes?

22:29.770 --> 22:32.600
Yes. Yes.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.110
And you know
something, Howard?
Mm.

22:38.110 --> 22:40.560
I'm going to figure out a way
to straighten your leopard fez.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.870
Come on, let's go home.

22:47.870 --> 22:48.870
Oh, I can't.

22:48.870 --> 22:51.370
I've still got three minutes
before quitting time.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.370
Well, okay, let's dance.

22:54.370 --> 22:56.380
I hope I can
find a slow one.

22:56.380 --> 22:57.880
It's late.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.380
Oh, Howard, this is on me.

22:59.380 --> 23:00.380
Oh.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.880
My tips.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.880
Thank you, Marion.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.880
Honey, this is a slug.

23:07.390 --> 23:09.890
Which one of the
kids gave you this?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.890
All of them.

23:47.590 --> 23:50.100
I'm all registered,
I start in two weeks.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.050
Ah.

23:51.050 --> 23:54.020
Howard, what are you doing
home this time of day?

23:54.020 --> 23:57.020
Well, is there anything wrong
with a man coming home

23:57.020 --> 24:01.020
to his beautiful wife
for lunch or whatever, hmm?

24:03.390 --> 24:06.390
Howard, are you
getting frisky?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.900
Hi, Mom.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.400
Joanie and I thought
we'd come home for lunch

24:11.400 --> 24:13.900
so we could spend
a little more time with you.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.400
How nice.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.410
Dad, what are
you doing here?

24:17.410 --> 24:20.410
I live here.

24:20.410 --> 24:22.410
Hi, Dad.

24:22.410 --> 24:26.410
Hey, we can all
have lunch together.

24:26.410 --> 24:27.920
Yeah, that's
a great idea.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.420
Joanie help me
fix lunch, okay?

24:29.890 --> 24:31.920
Come on.
Let's go.

24:32.890 --> 24:34.840
I guess this is no time

24:35.340 --> 24:37.590
to get F-R-I-S-K-Y.

24:37.590 --> 24:39.900
They're spelling
again, Richie.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.900
Yeah, but this time
it's not a fight.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.400
Here, let's get
out of here.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.900
Okay.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.240
Mom, Dad, Joanie and I are going
back to school. See you.

24:52.110 --> 24:53.070
