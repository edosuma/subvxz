have a mega slope here.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.476
But if you grade it properly,

straighten it out.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.548

18:01.580 --> 18:03.148

18:03.182 --> 18:05.250

52:22.474 --> 52:24.110
I know a lot more than you do,

52:24.143 --> 52:28.347
and his bottom line is 9.5.

52:28.380 --> 52:31.184
- So $9.5 million
best and final?

52:31.217 --> 52:33.853
- $9.5 million best and final.

52:33.887 --> 52:35.688
- Great. I'm gonna text him,

52:35.722 --> 52:38.909
'cause he knows that
we're negotiating right now.

52:38.910 --> 52:40.226
9.5.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.226
You know what, Hilary?

52:41.260 --> 52:43.697
You really made me
feel like I broke the rules

52:43.730 --> 52:45.632
by telling me there was
no room to negotiate.

52:45.664 --> 52:50.336
- Well, that's right, but the
best generals never ask, right?

52:50.369 --> 52:51.338
- They don't ask for permission.

52:51.371 --> 52:52.338
They beg for forgiveness.

52:52.371 --> 52:53.405
- That is correct.

52:53.440 --> 52:55.742
- It's a really good deal
on price for the house.

52:55.775 --> 52:57.242
[phone chimes]
- Okay. We got a text back.

52:57.277 --> 52:58.744
- Give me the good news.

52:58.777 --> 53:01.380
- So just so you know I
didn't write best and final.

53:01.414 --> 53:02.648
- Yes.

53:02.681 --> 53:04.184
- I wrote 9.5,

53:04.217 --> 53:07.454
and they have come up,
best and final, to 9.450.

53:07.487 --> 53:11.590
- 50,000.
- If we do not take this 9.450,

53:11.623 --> 53:14.260
we have made
the biggest mistake.

53:14.293 --> 53:15.762
- All right. I'm texting Kevin.

53:15.795 --> 53:17.764
This ultimately
will be his decision.

53:17.797 --> 53:19.733
- We are really getting
down to the line though.

53:19.766 --> 53:21.467
- I like it.

53:21.501 --> 53:25.371
- And you're really saying
that this is best and final,

53:25.405 --> 53:27.574
no questions asked, boom?

53:27.606 --> 53:29.108
- This is their best and final.

53:29.141 --> 53:30.777
And if we don't take
this, they're walking.

53:30.809 --> 53:32.778
We go on the
market. We go stale.

53:32.811 --> 53:35.280
You end up taking the eights
for it, in six months' time,

53:35.315 --> 53:36.615
whether it's with
us or another agent.

53:36.648 --> 53:38.784
- I 100% agree with
what Dave's saying.

53:38.818 --> 53:40.786
- I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

53:40.820 --> 53:43.289
It's 50 grand. It's
up to Kevin so--

53:43.322 --> 53:45.157
- Okay. I'll shut up.

53:45.190 --> 53:49.295
- Good.
- Thank you.

53:49.329 --> 53:50.797
Can you call him?

53:50.829 --> 53:53.766
- I texted him. I
don't need to call him.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.668
- Okay.

53:55.702 --> 53:58.405
[phone chimes]

53:58.438 --> 53:59.371
- Okay.

53:59.405 --> 54:01.608
Would you like to
know what the text says?

54:01.641 --> 54:03.710
- Please.

54:03.742 --> 54:05.711
- Against my advice,
you have a deal.

54:05.744 --> 54:07.246
- Oh, my God.

54:07.280 --> 54:09.382
Against my advice.
Against your advice.

54:09.416 --> 54:11.518
- That is wonderful
news, Hilary.

54:11.550 --> 54:14.320
Good job, everybody.
Thank you. Thank you.

54:14.353 --> 54:16.489
- That wasn't so bad, was it?
- It was a lot of fun.

54:16.523 --> 54:17.423
- Thank you, sweetheart.

54:17.456 --> 54:19.826
- Thank you. We're
out. God, I love her.

54:19.858 --> 54:21.393
- Well done, Jim.
- Well done.

54:21.427 --> 54:23.295
- That was a good one.
That was a good one.

54:23.329 --> 54:24.831
- That's a ----ing deal.

54:24.864 --> 54:27.199
<i>- Next time, on "Million
Dollar Listing LA"...</i>

54:27.233 --> 54:29.869
- Well, well, well.
Don't you look cute?

54:29.902 --> 54:31.538
- Is this your fedora?

54:31.570 --> 54:33.273
- I think it's a Suzanne
Somers fedora.

54:33.306 --> 54:36.309
- Oh, God. Look
how pretty this is.

54:36.342 --> 54:39.278
- This is what you want to see.
- Oh, I love this.

54:39.311 --> 54:40.847
When was the last
time you used this thing?

54:40.880 --> 54:42.849
- A couple weeks ago.

54:42.882 --> 54:44.851
- I mean you have so much
room and so many acres.

54:44.884 --> 54:47.554
You can just do
whatever you want.

54:47.586 --> 54:50.456
- No offers, right?
- You gave me 60 days.

54:50.489 --> 54:51.724
- Yeah, but I'm
trying to get to Europe

54:51.757 --> 54:53.726
and get this place sold.
What's the problem?

54:53.760 --> 54:55.594
- I have another 30 days, right?

54:55.628 --> 54:59.431
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

54:59.465 --> 55:00.867
<i>- We're ready to hit the market.</i>

55:00.900 --> 55:02.348
After what we've been
through in our lives,

55:02.349 --> 55:03.503
I'm ready to do it.

55:03.536 --> 55:05.271
I'm ready to sell, but
you need to deliver.

55:05.304 --> 55:08.340
- Full disclosure.
The client is my sister.

55:08.375 --> 55:09.641
- Keeping it in
the family, Trace?

55:09.675 --> 55:10.710
- Well, you know.

55:10.744 --> 55:12.378
- Michael, I love the house,

55:12.411 --> 55:14.447
and I think I've got a
great offer. 24 million.

55:14.481 --> 55:17.884
- I can't pick up the phone
and call her with that offer.

55:17.916 --> 55:21.588
I won't even present to
my client, sister or not.
