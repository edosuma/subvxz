CODY:

00:04.542 --> 00:07.375
Okay, that's Orion.

00:07.417 --> 00:09.750
I just need three more

00:07.417 --> 00:09.750
constellations,

00:09.792 --> 00:11.333
and astronomy homework is done.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.959
Ooh, ooh, there's the Mirtonian

00:11.375 --> 00:13.959
star cluster.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.542
HEATWAVE:

00:14.000 --> 00:15.542
Check your optics.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.458
Everyone knows the Mirtonian's

00:15.583 --> 00:18.458
way over there.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.667
Uh, guys? I don't think Earth

00:18.500 --> 00:21.667
has a "Mirtonian" constellation.

00:21.709 --> 00:25.667
Maybe you call it by a different

00:21.709 --> 00:25.667
name. Like the Big Dumper.

00:25.709 --> 00:27.417
It's Dipper, Boulder.

00:27.458 --> 00:31.041
What is the proper term

00:27.458 --> 00:31.041
for that?

00:32.542 --> 00:35.500
CODY:

00:32.542 --> 00:35.500
Whoa. No way.

00:36.667 --> 00:39.166
Do you know what this is?

00:39.208 --> 00:41.709
Proof the Maine Ridge Monster

00:39.208 --> 00:41.709
is real.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.041
And that will satisfy

00:41.750 --> 00:44.041
your homework assignment?

00:44.083 --> 00:46.125
What's a Maine Ridge Monster?

00:46.166 --> 00:48.083
It's New England's version

00:46.166 --> 00:48.083
of Sasquatch.

00:48.125 --> 00:49.500
You know, Bigfoot.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.834
Yeah,

00:49.542 --> 00:51.834
that doesn't really help.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.166
I'll explain later.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.000
Right now,

00:53.208 --> 00:55.000
we have to warn the island

00:55.041 --> 00:56.250
that thing's on the loose.

00:56.291 --> 00:57.750
BOULDER:

00:56.291 --> 00:57.750
But why?

00:57.792 --> 00:59.709
The creature hasn't done

00:57.792 --> 00:59.709
anything wrong.

00:59.750 --> 01:03.333
Boulder, it's a monster.

00:59.750 --> 01:03.333
They're just...bad.

01:03.375 --> 01:06.166
That's all I need to know.

How can a tiny animal

make such a huge stink?

It's incredible.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.875
That's not how it smells.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.917
According to the Lad Pioneer

02:16.959 --> 02:18.625

skunk odor removal requires

02:24.083 --> 02:25.834
Yeah, we'd better get home.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.291

02:25.875 --> 02:28.291
what we saw.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.625
At a hoax.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.583
Someone's pulling your leg,

02:36.667 --> 02:38.583
Cody.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.000
The Maine Ridge Monster,

02:40.041 --> 02:42.208
it's all just sci-fi

02:40.041 --> 02:42.208
conspiracy stuff.

02:42.250 --> 02:45.667
That's what we used to think

02:42.250 --> 02:45.667
about aliens too.

02:45.709 --> 02:49.166
Wait, wait, wait. Guys, guys,

02:45.709 --> 02:49.166
this is a real photo.

02:49.208 --> 02:53.250
Of Mr. Talbot, the lifeguard.

02:49.208 --> 02:53.250
Have you seen that guy?

02:53.291 --> 02:55.375
It's like he's wearing

02:53.291 --> 02:55.375
a permanent back-sweater.

02:55.417 --> 02:59.834
I know what I saw.

02:55.417 --> 02:59.834
You believe me, don't you, Dad?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.917
I believe you believe, son.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.667
But I don't think this photo

03:01.959 --> 03:04.667
will convince anyone

03:04.709 --> 03:07.417
the Monster is more than a good

03:04.709 --> 03:07.417
campfire story.

03:07.458 --> 03:10.000
Now, everyone better get to bed.

03:10.041 --> 03:12.542
We have a busy day at the lunch

03:10.041 --> 03:12.542
fundraiser tomorrow.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.417
At least I can guarantee you

03:12.583 --> 03:16.417
a monster of a sandwich.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.875
Right.

03:27.792 --> 03:31.583
Dad, since when is a sandwich

03:27.792 --> 03:31.583
sale a Rescue Team mission?

03:31.625 --> 03:35.709
Since the mayor decided our

03:31.625 --> 03:35.709
presence brings more customers.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.542

04:01.333 --> 04:03.333
Hey, Mr. Prescott.

04:03.375 --> 04:07.041
Can't you see I am making

04:03.375 --> 04:07.041
scintillating news here?

04:07.083 --> 04:09.417
Yeah. That's why I knew

04:07.083 --> 04:09.417
you'd want to see this.

04:09.458 --> 04:14.208
See what? A blurry picture

04:09.458 --> 04:14.208
of Mr. Talbot?

04:14.250 --> 04:17.917
No. It's the Maine Ridge

04:14.250 --> 04:17.917
Monster. I saw him last night.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.583
Yeah, sure you did. Look, kid,

04:17.959 --> 04:21.583
I've got real stories to cover.

04:21.625 --> 04:25.709

You got it, Dad. One perfectly

04:30.166 --> 04:33.875
cooked burger coming up.

04:33.917 --> 04:37.875
Watch as the hamburger flies

04:37.917 --> 04:40.625

Mm-mm. Good science

04:43.291 --> 04:46.750
is delicious.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.875
Ready to launch

04:46.792 --> 04:48.875
more lunch, Dad.

04:48.917 --> 04:52.291
Why settle for an ordinary,

04:48.917 --> 04:52.291
boring burger,

04:52.333 --> 04:56.458
when you can have a Magic-Meat

04:52.333 --> 04:56.458
burger instead.

04:56.500 --> 05:00.583
Wait. Mr. Mayor,

04:56.500 --> 05:00.583
that's too big of a serving.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.083
Nonsense.

05:03.125 --> 05:07.291
You can never have too much

How about these Burnses, folks?

05:55.250 --> 05:56.834

Uh, thanks?

06:07.166 --> 06:09.709
...here's a case

06:07.166 --> 06:09.709
of my Magic-Meat.

06:09.750 --> 06:12.125
It's real hero food.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.792
And after the fundraiser,

06:13.834 --> 06:17.083
it'll be available at

06:13.834 --> 06:17.083
a grocery store near you.

06:17.125 --> 06:20.917
Go on, son,

06:17.125 --> 06:20.917
try some for the camera.

06:20.959 --> 06:23.625
I'd better

06:20.959 --> 06:23.625
share this with my family.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.542
Mr. Huxley?

06:23.667 --> 06:26.542
What about my Monster photo?

06:26.583 --> 06:28.458
( man clears throat )

06:30.166 --> 06:33.208
Oh, hi, Mr. Talbot.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.417
Tonight, we're getting Monster

06:39.667 --> 06:42.417
proof everyone will believe.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.625
Excellent. An evidence-gathering

06:42.458 --> 06:45.625
expedition.

06:45.667 --> 06:49.125
Hopefully more. I have a score

06:45.667 --> 06:49.125
to settle with that beast.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.083
He's the reason I got skunked.

06:51.125 --> 06:54.208
Maybe we should try

06:51.125 --> 06:54.208
communicating with the creature.

06:54.250 --> 06:57.750
Those teeth and claws did not

06:54.250 --> 06:57.750
look friendly, Boulder.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.917
Um, Graham?

07:02.959 --> 07:04.834
Can I ask you a question?

07:04.875 --> 07:07.083
Sure. Yeah,

07:04.875 --> 07:07.083
I could use a break.

07:07.125 --> 07:11.875
If something looks scary,

07:07.125 --> 07:11.875
does that mean it is scary?

07:11.917 --> 07:15.875
Well, the best way to find out

07:11.917 --> 07:15.875
is to learn more about it.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.709
A lot of times,

07:15.917 --> 07:17.709
people are just afraid

07:17.750 --> 07:19.417
of what they don't understand.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.333
For instance,

07:19.458 --> 07:21.333
I'm a little scared

07:21.375 --> 07:24.125
of my quantum mechanics homework

07:21.375 --> 07:24.125
right now.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.000
I think I can help you

07:24.166 --> 07:26.000
with that.

07:26.041 --> 07:30.375
Soon as I get back from a little

07:26.041 --> 07:30.375
research trip. Thanks, Graham.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.500
Always here for you, buddy.

07:36.125 --> 07:37.667
( owl hoots )

07:39.208 --> 07:42.333
Come on, Monster, show yourself.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.834
Unless you don't want to,

07:42.375 --> 07:43.834
Ridgey.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.709
"Ridgey?"

07:45.750 --> 07:49.458
I thought if I gave him a name,

07:45.750 --> 07:49.458
he'd seem less, well, monstrous.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.041
How many creature features

07:49.500 --> 07:52.041
have you seen?

07:52.083 --> 07:54.250
Naming a monster just gives you

07:52.083 --> 07:54.250
something to yell

07:54.291 --> 07:56.000
when it grabs you.

07:56.041 --> 08:00.166
Maybe Ridgey is different. Cody,

07:56.041 --> 08:00.166
can you tell us more about him?

08:00.208 --> 08:03.166
Well, the Maine Ridge Monster

08:00.208 --> 08:03.166
was first seen

08:03.208 --> 08:05.083
on the mainland in the 1800s.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.875
According to reports,

08:05.125 --> 08:07.875
it's 8' tall.

08:07.917 --> 08:10.250
Or, uh, 18.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.875
And a white patch on its chest.

08:11.917 --> 08:13.583
Or, uh, no patch.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.417
Tsk-tsk. Witness accounts

08:13.625 --> 08:16.417
are so unreliable.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.208
Is that why Chief

08:16.458 --> 08:18.208
is reluctant to believe

08:18.250 --> 08:19.750
in the creature's existence?

08:19.792 --> 08:23.333
Well, that and there's never

08:19.792 --> 08:23.333
been any actual,

08:23.375 --> 08:25.250
physical proof

08:23.375 --> 08:25.250
that Ridgey is real.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.291
Until now.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.083
( creature howling )

08:30.125 --> 08:32.166
Let's go meet Ridgey.

08:32.208 --> 08:33.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

08:33.792 --> 08:36.291
( growls )

08:37.542 --> 08:40.709
Noble. I knew he was real.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.125
I don't understand...

08:42.166 --> 08:44.542
Why would Ridgey attack

08:42.166 --> 08:44.542
an old building?

08:44.583 --> 08:48.542
Because monsters are... bad.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.041
He's going inside the cannery.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.709
( roaring and growling )

09:01.542 --> 09:04.834
Breaking, entering,

09:01.542 --> 09:04.834
destruction of property.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.333
( machine beeping )

09:07.375 --> 09:09.667
And utter disdain

09:07.375 --> 09:09.667
of safety codes.

09:09.709 --> 09:13.542
I'm afraid I side with Blades,

09:09.709 --> 09:13.542
Boulder. Ridgey is bad.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.875
Or maybe he's looking

09:16.750 --> 09:19.875
for something.

09:19.917 --> 09:21.792
( roars )

09:24.291 --> 09:26.792
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:28.709 --> 09:30.000
( roars )

09:31.291 --> 09:33.041
( camera clicks )

09:41.792 --> 09:43.750
( gasps )

09:43.792 --> 09:45.709
( roars )

09:45.750 --> 09:48.208
Stop. Don't hurt him.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.750
( growls )

10:00.208 --> 10:02.250
I'm going after that thing.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.250
Heatwave, wait.

10:02.291 --> 10:05.709
The whole building's

10:02.291 --> 10:05.709
about to collapse.

10:05.750 --> 10:09.583
Rescue Bots,

10:05.750 --> 10:09.583
power up and energize.

10:09.625 --> 10:11.959
(  triumphant theme playing  )

10:21.083 --> 10:22.458
( grunts )

10:23.834 --> 10:25.417
( grunting )

10:27.083 --> 10:30.667
Power up and energize.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.458
Nice work, guys.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.000
No way Dad can say

10:39.500 --> 10:42.000
that wasn't real.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.583
When he sees these photos,

10:42.041 --> 10:44.583
he'll--

10:44.625 --> 10:47.125
Aww. My proof.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.291
Perhaps we have other evidence.

10:51.667 --> 10:55.417
Wet monster hair. This must have

10:51.667 --> 10:55.417
come off Ridgey.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.667
Ugh. It smells worse

10:55.458 --> 10:58.667
than Heatwave.

10:58.709 --> 11:00.250
Well, it does.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.792
It still seems strange.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.792
Why would Ridgey come here?

11:03.834 --> 11:06.792
Who knows? Monsters aren't

11:03.834 --> 11:06.792
exactly predictable.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.333
(  mysterious theme playing  )

11:11.250 --> 11:13.166
BURNS:

11:11.250 --> 11:13.166
That's quite a story, Cody.

11:13.208 --> 11:16.083
But I can't say I approve

11:13.208 --> 11:16.083
of your late-night escapade.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.417
Graham, we'll need to examine

11:16.125 --> 11:18.417
the old cannery

11:18.458 --> 11:20.417
to make sure

11:18.458 --> 11:20.417
the structure's stable.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.583
Mm. Mm-hm.

11:22.625 --> 11:26.000
You guys! I'm holding actual

11:22.625 --> 11:26.000
monster fur here.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.709
DANI:

11:26.041 --> 11:27.709
I don't think so, Cody.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.417
This hair isn't even organic.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.417
It's fake.

11:30.458 --> 11:32.291
Kinda like someone's story.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.083
Well, doesn't the cannery damage

11:34.125 --> 11:36.000
prove we saw

11:34.125 --> 11:36.000
the Maine Ridge Monster?

11:36.041 --> 11:37.542
You saw something, son.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.542
But it could be anything

11:37.583 --> 11:39.542
from a bear

11:39.583 --> 11:41.041
to a human in a costume.

11:43.792 --> 11:46.125
You believe we saw Ridgey,

11:43.792 --> 11:46.125
right?

11:47.792 --> 11:51.709
Well, whatever that thing was,

11:47.792 --> 11:51.709
it knew how to fight.

11:51.750 --> 11:55.542
It is true that most legendary

11:51.750 --> 11:55.542
creatures prove to be imaginary.

11:55.583 --> 11:58.208
The Loch Ness Monster, the Yeti,

11:55.583 --> 11:58.208
Prince Charming.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.417
There is no hard evidence

11:58.250 --> 12:00.417
they exist.

12:00.458 --> 12:04.291
Well, of course they do.

12:00.458 --> 12:04.291
I've seen all of them in movies.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.875
You've seen special effects,

12:04.333 --> 12:06.875
Blades.

12:06.917 --> 12:10.333
Those "creatures" are CGI.

12:06.917 --> 12:10.333
Just made with computers.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.333
But...

12:10.375 --> 12:12.333
We just don't have enough data

12:12.375 --> 12:14.041
to make

12:12.375 --> 12:14.041
an informed analysis yet.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.041
Right, Graham?

12:16.083 --> 12:19.291
Huh? Mm, yeah. Mm.

12:19.333 --> 12:20.625
( sniffs )

12:20.667 --> 12:24.500
Oh, bro, how can you

12:20.667 --> 12:24.500
eat that stuff?

12:24.542 --> 12:27.000
I was up late doing homework,

12:27.041 --> 12:28.583
and there was nothing else

12:27.041 --> 12:28.583
to eat.

12:28.625 --> 12:31.625
The taste grows on you. Even

12:28.625 --> 12:31.625
the aftertaste grows on you.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.125
Yeah,

12:31.667 --> 12:34.125
but what's growing on it?

12:34.166 --> 12:36.291
( communication device buzzing )

12:37.625 --> 12:39.542
Chief. I've been robbed.

12:39.583 --> 12:43.166
Last night, someone broke

12:39.583 --> 12:43.166
into my personal storehouse

12:43.208 --> 12:46.583
and stole every last can

12:43.208 --> 12:46.583
of my Magic-Meat.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.250
Heh. Hope you've got

12:48.125 --> 12:50.250
an alibi, Graham.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.625
No way anyone else

12:50.291 --> 12:52.625
would eat that stuff.

12:52.667 --> 12:53.917
( belch )

12:53.959 --> 12:57.583
Oh, hey, uh, excuse me.

12:57.625 --> 13:00.250
(  upbeat theme playing  )

13:05.125 --> 13:07.125
Well, this place is cleaned out.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.875
There aren't even

13:07.166 --> 13:08.875
any dust bunnies.

13:08.917 --> 13:12.291
I want that thief caught

13:08.917 --> 13:12.291
and put in stocks, Chief.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.291
We don't really use stocks

13:12.333 --> 13:15.291
anymore, Mr. Mayor.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.333
Dad, look!

13:24.500 --> 13:27.417
My Magic-Meat.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.625
Aw, this can is empty.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.792
CODY:

13:30.667 --> 13:32.792
There's a whole trail of 'em.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.125
Looks like our thief

13:32.834 --> 13:35.125
had to eat and run.

13:35.166 --> 13:38.792
Back to your Bots, team.

13:35.166 --> 13:38.792
We have a lead.

13:38.834 --> 13:42.375
The stocks, Chief.

13:38.834 --> 13:42.375
The stocks!

13:44.250 --> 13:46.750
(  action theme playing  )

13:57.917 --> 14:01.375
This is where the trail

13:57.917 --> 14:01.375
of cans ends?

14:01.417 --> 14:02.375
At home?

14:02.417 --> 14:04.166
I suppose it's possible

14:02.417 --> 14:04.166
the thief

14:04.208 --> 14:06.625
just ran out

14:04.208 --> 14:06.625
of Magic-Meat here.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.208
But I don't like coincidences.

14:08.250 --> 14:09.542
DANI:

14:08.250 --> 14:09.542
Yeah. For all we know,

14:09.583 --> 14:11.333
the robber could be inside

14:09.583 --> 14:11.333
right now.

14:11.375 --> 14:13.041
Let's see

14:11.375 --> 14:13.041
if the security cameras

14:13.083 --> 14:14.542
caught anything last night.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.709
( beeping )

14:16.750 --> 14:18.917
What was that?

14:18.959 --> 14:21.458
( grunts )

14:23.709 --> 14:25.166
Buddy?

14:23.709 --> 14:25.166
Son?

14:25.208 --> 14:26.667
Graham?

14:25.208 --> 14:26.667
Bro?

14:26.709 --> 14:28.083
( grunting )

14:28.125 --> 14:29.333
( screams )

14:29.375 --> 14:31.291
( growling )

14:38.500 --> 14:41.000
( howling )

14:44.375 --> 14:46.875
Cody, get back!

14:49.792 --> 14:52.375
( howling )

14:52.417 --> 14:56.500
If that was CGI,

14:52.417 --> 14:56.500
it was very well done.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.291
How could this happen?

14:58.333 --> 15:01.208
We have to go after him. If

14:58.333 --> 15:01.208
anyone else finds him first...

15:01.250 --> 15:02.875
Team, start a search now.

15:02.917 --> 15:04.917
Dani, Blades,

15:02.917 --> 15:04.917
get an aerial view.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.208
Don't worry, Chief.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.208
We'll track it down.

15:08.250 --> 15:11.875
It? Heatwave, that's Graham

15:08.250 --> 15:11.875
you're talking about.

15:11.917 --> 15:14.834
Graham or not, we have to stop

15:11.917 --> 15:14.834
that thing before it--

15:14.875 --> 15:19.083
He hurts someone. Or worse.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.125
Where are we going, Dad?

15:27.166 --> 15:29.834
Obviously, to file for Graham's

15:27.166 --> 15:29.834
animal license.

15:32.166 --> 15:35.834
BURNS:

15:32.166 --> 15:35.834
No. We're getting some answers.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.291
This is Huxley Prescott,

15:38.333 --> 15:41.625
back with more

15:38.333 --> 15:41.625
of Monster-Watch 24/7.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.583
Frightened Griffin Rock citizens

15:41.667 --> 15:44.583
are reporting sightings

15:44.625 --> 15:48.250
of the Maine Ridge Monster

15:44.625 --> 15:48.250
from every side of the island.

15:48.291 --> 15:51.375
Oh, sure, now Huxley

15:48.291 --> 15:51.375
believes in monsters.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.208
Fortunately, our bravest

15:51.417 --> 15:54.208
are preparing a trap

15:54.250 --> 15:57.333
for the craven creature.

15:57.375 --> 16:00.041
We have to find Graham

15:57.375 --> 16:00.041
before they do.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.458
Frightened people

16:00.083 --> 16:02.458
do dangerous things.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.208
Doc, have you ever seen

16:02.500 --> 16:05.208
this logo before?

16:05.250 --> 16:08.542
Graham was eating from this can

16:05.250 --> 16:08.542
before he...changed.

16:08.583 --> 16:11.792
FoFoo. But where on earth

16:08.583 --> 16:11.792
did he get it?

16:11.834 --> 16:14.667
Uh, Dad? What's FoFoo?

16:14.709 --> 16:18.667
Forever Food. So called, because

16:14.709 --> 16:18.667
it had no expiration date.

16:18.709 --> 16:20.083
It was a failed product,

16:20.125 --> 16:22.625
shelved back when I was

16:20.125 --> 16:22.625
a junior scientist.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.709
It seems FoFoo research

16:22.667 --> 16:25.709
was discontinued

16:25.750 --> 16:28.750
when scientists found that

16:25.750 --> 16:28.750
in the absence of U.V. rays--

16:28.792 --> 16:33.083
sunlight-- the meat caused

16:28.792 --> 16:33.083
unusual behavior.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.792
Unusual?

16:33.125 --> 16:35.792
What does that mean?

16:35.834 --> 16:39.291
It's science-speak for "we have

16:35.834 --> 16:39.291
no idea what just happened,

16:39.333 --> 16:41.125
but it's pretty horrible."

16:41.166 --> 16:45.125
Like, "FoFoo turned my brother

16:41.166 --> 16:45.125
into a monster" kinda horrible?

16:45.166 --> 16:47.208
That sounds about right.

16:47.250 --> 16:51.291
Apparently a stockpile of unused

16:47.250 --> 16:51.291
FoFoo was sealed in Bunker 16.

16:51.333 --> 16:54.417
Sixteen? That backs right up

16:51.333 --> 16:54.417
against the Mayor's mansion.

16:54.458 --> 16:55.667
( gasps )

16:55.709 --> 16:57.041
He must have found

16:55.709 --> 16:57.041
the old FoFoo

16:57.083 --> 17:00.041
and re-sold it

16:57.083 --> 17:00.041
as Magic-Meat. Gross.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.000
But very enterprising of him.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.875
This product sells itself.

17:04.917 --> 17:07.834
Eating FoFoo

17:04.917 --> 17:07.834
makes a person crave more.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.917
That's why Ridgey

17:07.875 --> 17:09.917
was at the cannery.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.583
Once he ate the Mayor's stash,

17:11.625 --> 17:14.542
he was looking for more cans

17:11.625 --> 17:14.542
of FoFoo.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.250
Now the only place

17:14.583 --> 17:16.250
to find some...

17:16.291 --> 17:17.709
Don't say it.

17:17.750 --> 17:21.000
...is on the Best Left

17:17.750 --> 17:21.000
Forgotten shelves.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.625
Just once, couldn't something

17:21.041 --> 17:24.625
in the B.L.F. stay forgotten?

17:24.667 --> 17:27.208
I'm afraid Griffin Rock

17:24.667 --> 17:27.208
is quite thorough

17:27.250 --> 17:29.750
when cataloging

17:27.250 --> 17:29.750
its scientific failures.

17:29.792 --> 17:32.625
All units, rendezvous at

17:29.792 --> 17:32.625
the Hall of Inspiration.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.834
On our way.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.834
We're en route.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.375
Be there as soon as I can.

17:36.417 --> 17:38.458
But I have to make

17:36.417 --> 17:38.458
a stop first.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.125
( siren wailing )

17:41.166 --> 17:42.792
CODY:

17:41.166 --> 17:42.792
There's still one thing

17:41.166 --> 17:42.792
I don't get.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.625
We saw the monster

17:42.834 --> 17:44.625
the night before

17:44.667 --> 17:46.250
the mayor gave Graham

17:44.667 --> 17:46.250
that Magic-Meat.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.792
Dad. I've spotted Graham.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.792
You were right.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.709
He's heading toward

17:48.834 --> 17:50.709
the Hall from the south.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.917
Negatory.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.917
We're tracking Graham now.

17:52.959 --> 17:54.375
He's coming from the north.

17:54.417 --> 17:56.500
BOTH ( in unison ):

17:54.417 --> 17:56.500
Two monsters.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.834
The mayor was eating a ton

17:56.542 --> 17:58.834
of his own Magic-Meat

17:58.875 --> 18:01.542
at the Sandwich Sale.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.542
And the fake fur I found...

18:01.583 --> 18:03.417
The mayor's toupee.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.709
Mayor Luskey

18:03.458 --> 18:05.709
is the other monster.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.709
(  ominous theme playing  )

18:13.417 --> 18:16.125
( growling )

18:22.792 --> 18:24.125
( monster roaring )

18:26.375 --> 18:28.959
Rescue Bots,

18:26.375 --> 18:28.959
roll to the rescue.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.500
( both growling )

18:38.959 --> 18:42.500
Chief, you have to restrain

18:38.959 --> 18:42.500
those monsters.

18:42.542 --> 18:45.375
They are nearing some highly

18:42.542 --> 18:45.375
explosive material.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.041
We so have to find

18:45.417 --> 18:47.041
a better place

18:47.083 --> 18:49.125
to keep that nitroglycerin.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.000
( growling )

18:51.041 --> 18:52.834
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:52.875 --> 18:56.333
Out of my way, Boulder. Doc said

18:52.875 --> 18:56.333
to take the monsters down.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.667
No. They're not monsters.

18:58.709 --> 19:01.208
One's the mayor

18:58.709 --> 19:01.208
and one's Graham.

19:01.250 --> 19:04.125
It's time

19:01.250 --> 19:04.125
we tried things my way.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.125
I'm going

19:04.166 --> 19:06.125
to talk to my partner.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.583
( growling )

19:06.166 --> 19:08.583
BOULDER: Graham. Graham!

19:08.625 --> 19:10.709
( snarling )

19:10.750 --> 19:12.333
Hey, buddy,

19:12.375 --> 19:15.375
you asked me to help you

19:12.375 --> 19:15.375
with your homework, remember?

19:15.417 --> 19:17.542
( growls )

19:17.583 --> 19:19.375
You didn't understand it.

19:19.417 --> 19:22.417
And now, you don't understand

19:19.417 --> 19:22.417
what's happened to you.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.417
( growls )

19:25.458 --> 19:28.375
You're scared. And I can help

19:25.458 --> 19:28.375
you with that too.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.333
( panting )

19:30.375 --> 19:33.291
That's good. But first you have

19:30.375 --> 19:33.291
to step away from that crate.

19:33.333 --> 19:36.208
It's full of explosives.

19:40.542 --> 19:43.083
( growling )

19:43.125 --> 19:45.625
Stay back!

19:43.125 --> 19:45.625
You'll frighten them.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.750
( growling )

19:54.709 --> 19:56.834
( gasps )

20:01.834 --> 20:03.083
( growling )

20:03.125 --> 20:04.875
Come along quietly,

20:03.125 --> 20:04.875
Your Honor.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.125
( roaring )

20:06.166 --> 20:08.959
Or loudly.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.959
But please, no snapping.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.709
You really are always there

20:10.625 --> 20:12.709
for me, buddy.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.667
( grunts )

20:16.792 --> 20:18.709
I guess I'm glad

20:16.792 --> 20:18.709
I don't remember

20:18.750 --> 20:20.083
much of being a monster.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.834
But what if

20:20.125 --> 20:21.834
I change back again?

20:21.875 --> 20:23.709
GREENE:

20:21.875 --> 20:23.709
Oh, you will.

20:23.750 --> 20:27.083
As long as there's FoFoo in

20:23.750 --> 20:27.083
your system when the moon rises.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.959
Don't worry.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.959
Dad's got a cure.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.625
But if you ask me, it's worse

20:30.000 --> 20:33.625
than being a were-creature.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.750
We need to counteract

20:33.667 --> 20:35.750
the synthetic food

20:35.792 --> 20:37.000
with fresh greens.

20:37.041 --> 20:40.834
Raw broccoli, spinach,

20:37.041 --> 20:40.834
and kale.

20:40.875 --> 20:43.208
One tiny request.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.250
Salt?

20:44.291 --> 20:46.875
No. A hat.

20:48.542 --> 20:52.750
Uh, sorry I nearly

20:48.542 --> 20:52.750
trounced you, Graham.

20:52.792 --> 20:54.250
No offense.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.542
It's okay.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.041
I looked like a monster.

20:57.083 --> 21:00.000
Yeah, and I smell like a skunk.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.917
Doesn't mean I am one.

21:01.959 --> 21:04.333
I wonder if any other

21:01.959 --> 21:04.333
late-movie creep-a-zoids exist.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.792
Because if a

21:04.375 --> 21:06.792
zombie-mutant-potato attacks,

21:06.834 --> 21:08.792
I am so out of here.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.208
All right,

21:08.834 --> 21:10.208
that's it.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.917
Lights out at 8 p.m.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.917
and no TV.

21:12.959 --> 21:14.750
W-What about soaps?

21:14.792 --> 21:17.166
Musical comedy? Infomercials?

21:17.208 --> 21:19.792
I know you're out there

21:17.208 --> 21:19.792
somewhere, Ridgey.

21:19.834 --> 21:23.500
And someday,

21:19.834 --> 21:23.500
I'm gonna find you.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.834
( creature howling )

21:29.959 --> 21:32.458
(  dramatic theme playing  )
