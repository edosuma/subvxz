QUESTIONS AND NON-ANSWERS, BEST

00:56.400 --> 00:57.567
SUMMED UP BY THIS EXCHANGE.

00:57.633 --> 00:59.300
>> YOU KNOW, MOST OF US HAVE

00:59.367 --> 01:00.934
MULTIPLE NOTEBOOKS AND NOTES

01:01.000 --> 01:02.066
AND BOOKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:02.133 --> 01:03.600

01:03.667 --> 01:04.599
CAN YOU HOLD UP WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

01:04.667 --> 01:05.200
REFERRING TO IN ANSWERING OUR

01:05.266 --> 01:08.533
QUESTIONS?

01:08.600 --> 01:10.633
IS THERE ANYTHING ON IT?

01:10.700 --> 01:12.100
>> THE LETTERHEAD THAT SAYS

01:12.166 --> 01:14.467
"UNITED STATES SENATE."

01:14.533 --> 01:18.600
>> THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.000
>> John: EXCEPT, NO, IT ISN'T.

01:21.066 --> 01:21.867
IT'S REALLY NOT IMPRESSIVE AT

01:21.934 --> 01:22.367
ALL.

01:22.433 --> 01:23.100
PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S EMBLEMATIC

01:23.166 --> 01:23.934
OF THE FACT SHE DODGED ALMOST

01:24.000 --> 01:24.700
EVERYTHING SHE WAS ASKED,

01:24.767 --> 01:25.567
AND PARTLY BECAUSE THIS WHOLE

01:25.633 --> 01:26.467
HEARING WAS PRE-ORDAINED

01:26.533 --> 01:27.800
BY THE REPUBLICANS.

01:27.867 --> 01:29.867
THAT PAD COULD'VE CONTAINED

01:29.934 --> 01:31.233
A DRAWING OF A MUSCULAR,

01:31.300 --> 01:34.100
ANATOMICALLY-CORRECT GARFIELD,

01:34.166 --> 01:34.867
AND THEY'D STILL HAVE ALL SAID,

01:34.934 --> 01:37.433
"THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.166
IT'S A YES FROM ME."

01:38.233 --> 01:38.834
BUT ALTHOUGH BARRETT WAS

01:38.900 --> 01:39.967
EVASIVE, THERE WERE STILL

01:40.033 --> 01:40.667
TELLING MOMENTS, LIKE HER

01:40.734 --> 01:41.600
REFUSING TO SAY SHE ACCEPTS

01:41.667 --> 01:42.600
CLIMATE CHANGE AS A SCIENTIFIC

01:42.667 --> 01:44.100
FACT, ARGUING THAT ROE V. WADE

01:44.166 --> 01:45.400
IS NOT A "SUPER-PRECEDENT,"

01:45.467 --> 01:46.633
AND REFERRING TO GAY PEOPLE AS

01:46.700 --> 01:48.166
HAVING A "SEXUAL PREFERENCE,"

01:48.233 --> 01:50.967
RATHER THAN ORIENTATION.

01:51.033 --> 01:54.233
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS,

01:54.300 --> 01:54.934
BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY NOT A

01:55.000 --> 01:55.667
PREFERENCE.

01:55.734 --> 01:56.367
NO ONE JUST CHOOSES TO BE

01:56.433 --> 01:57.100
ATTRACTED TO THE SAME SEX,

01:57.166 --> 01:58.066
OR A DIFFERENT SEX,

01:58.133 --> 01:59.633
OR TO ADAM DRIVER.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.100
WE ALL SIMPLY ARE.

02:02.166 --> 02:03.467
DISLOCATE MY ANKLES,

02:03.533 --> 02:05.233
YOU RUSTY CELLO.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.033
TIE MY FINGERS IN A SQUARE KNOT,

02:07.100 --> 02:08.433
YOU EMOTIONALLY-UNAVAILABLE

02:08.500 --> 02:10.100
WATER TOWER.

02:10.166 --> 02:11.467
AND THE SUPREME COURT HEARINGS

02:11.533 --> 02:12.467
WEREN'T THE ONLY

02:12.533 --> 02:14.066
QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSIONS

02:14.133 --> 02:15.033
THIS WEEK.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.400
TRUMP AND BIDEN HELD DUELING

02:16.467 --> 02:17.133
TOWN HALLS ON THURSDAY.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.400
ORIGINALLY, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

02:18.467 --> 02:19.600
BE A DEBATE BETWEEN THE TWO,

02:19.667 --> 02:21.734
BUT AFTER TRUMP PULLED OUT,

02:21.800 --> 02:23.367
NBC REWARDED HIM WITH AN HOUR

02:23.433 --> 02:24.400
OF TV ALL TO HIMSELF, SOMETHING

02:24.467 --> 02:26.333
WHICH IS, IF NOTHING ELSE,

02:26.400 --> 02:28.266
VERY MUCH ON-BRAND FOR THEM.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.333
AND TRUMP'S HIGH POINT OF

02:29.400 --> 02:30.867
THE NIGHT WAS PROBABLY THIS.

02:30.934 --> 02:31.700
>> I HAVE TO SAY, YOU HAVE

02:31.767 --> 02:33.166
A GREAT SMILE.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.266
>> THANK YOU.

02:34.333 --> 02:37.033
THANK YOU.

02:37.100 --> 02:37.800
>> HE DOES.

02:37.867 --> 02:38.633
YOU'RE SO HANDSOME

02:38.700 --> 02:40.033
WHEN YOU SMILE.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.900
>> John: IS HE?

02:43.967 --> 02:46.834
IS HE REALLY?

02:46.900 --> 02:47.734
I'M NOT QUITE SO SURE ABOUT

02:47.800 --> 02:48.166
THAT.

02:48.233 --> 02:49.367
UNLESS BY "HANDSOME,"

02:49.433 --> 02:50.100
YOU MEAN "LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE

02:50.166 --> 02:50.967
DROPPED THEIR DENTURES IN A

02:51.033 --> 02:51.834
JACK-O-LANTERN ON

02:51.900 --> 02:52.967
NOVEMBER 14TH," IN WHICH CASE,

02:53.033 --> 02:55.767
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.033
THE MAN'S GOT A SMILE THAT CAN

02:57.100 --> 02:58.166
LIGHT UP A CROSS.

02:58.233 --> 02:59.100
ALTHOUGH AS HIGH POINTS WENT,

02:59.166 --> 03:00.266
THAT WAS BASICALLY IT FOR

03:00.333 --> 03:01.066
THE PRESIDENT.

03:01.133 --> 03:02.100
EVEN THAT MOMENT TURNED FAST.

03:02.166 --> 03:02.734
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED

03:02.800 --> 03:04.567
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS.

03:04.633 --> 03:05.166
>> YOU'RE SO HANDSOME WHEN YOU

03:05.233 --> 03:08.300
SMILE.

03:08.367 --> 03:11.433
AS THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS TO

03:11.500 --> 03:12.834
THE UNITED STATES WHO FLED

03:12.900 --> 03:16.400
EASTERN EUROPE DUE TO RELIGIOUS

03:16.467 --> 03:19.200
PERSECUTION, THE UNITED STATES

03:19.266 --> 03:20.667
IMMIGRATION POLICIES ARE VERY

03:20.734 --> 03:23.133
PERSONAL FOR ME.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.400
IF YOU ARE ELECTED TO A SECOND

03:25.467 --> 03:30.266
TERM, DO YOU EXPECT TO PURSUE

03:30.333 --> 03:31.333
YOUR PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO CUT

03:31.400 --> 03:33.066
THE DACA PROGRAM?

03:33.133 --> 03:34.834
>> John: WOW.

03:34.900 --> 03:37.100
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE

03:37.166 --> 03:38.000
THE PERFECT WAY TO ASK TRUMP

03:38.066 --> 03:39.433
A QUESTION.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.000
"YOU HAVE A LOVELY SMILE.

03:41.066 --> 03:42.000
ANYWAY, YOU'D HAVE DOOMED

03:42.066 --> 03:42.467
MY ANCESTORS TO DIE

03:42.533 --> 03:43.367
IN THE HOLOCAUST.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.500
WHY?"

03:45.567 --> 03:47.100
TRUMP'S TOWN HALL, LIKE HIS

03:47.166 --> 03:49.667
ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, WAS EXTREMELY

03:49.734 --> 03:50.500
LIGHT ON POLICY DETAILS.

03:50.567 --> 03:52.100
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK

03:52.166 --> 03:53.166
IN SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT A SECOND

03:53.233 --> 03:55.934
TRUMP TERM WOULD MEAN.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.333
HE'S MADE VERY FEW CONCRETE

03:57.400 --> 03:58.834
PROMISES, OTHER THAN, "I WILL

03:58.900 --> 04:00.767
NOT LEAVE, I WILL NOT DIE,"

04:00.834 --> 04:01.467
AND, "I WILL GIVE YOU COVID

04:01.533 --> 04:02.800
PERSONALLY."

04:02.867 --> 04:04.433
BUT TONIGHT, I'D LIKE TO TALK

04:04.500 --> 04:05.166
ABOUT SOMETHING INCREDIBLY

04:05.233 --> 04:06.300
IMPORTANT THAT HINGES

04:06.367 --> 04:08.200
ON THIS ELECTION.

04:08.266 --> 04:10.567
BECAUSE OUR MAIN STORY CONCERNS

04:10.633 --> 04:12.500
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,

04:12.567 --> 04:13.600
OR W.H.O.

04:13.667 --> 04:14.433
YOU MAY ALREADY BE AWARE OF IT

04:14.500 --> 04:15.300
IN ITS ROLE AS ONE OF THE

04:15.367 --> 04:16.233
PRESIDENT'S FAVORITE PUNCHING

04:16.300 --> 04:17.632
BAGS.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.899
>> THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

04:19.966 --> 04:21.166
SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF

04:21.233 --> 04:22.567
THEMSELVES.

04:22.633 --> 04:23.600
>> I'M NOT HAPPY WITH

04:23.667 --> 04:24.400
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

04:24.467 --> 04:26.667
>> THEY'RE A PUPPET OF CHINA.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.266
THEY'RE CHINA-CENTRIC,

04:28.333 --> 04:29.800
TO PUT IT NICER.

04:29.867 --> 04:30.367
>> THEY'RE LITERALLY A PIPE

04:30.433 --> 04:31.300
ORGAN FOR CHINA.

04:31.367 --> 04:33.467
THAT'S THE WAY I VIEW IT.

04:33.533 --> 04:34.734
>> John: OKAY, THE W.H.O. IS

04:34.800 --> 04:36.200
NOT LITERALLY A PIPE ORGAN FOR

04:36.266 --> 04:38.500
CHINA, BECAUSE THE ONLY THING

04:38.567 --> 04:40.133
THAT IS LITERALLY A PIPE ORGAN

04:40.200 --> 04:42.000
FOR CHINA IS A PIPE ORGAN.

04:42.066 --> 04:43.033
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE WORD

04:43.100 --> 04:45.133
"LITERALLY" MEANS.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.567
OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

04:46.633 --> 04:48.633
TRUMP HAS CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO

04:48.700 --> 04:50.333
DEFLECT BLAME FOR HIS HANDLING

04:50.400 --> 04:52.100
OF THE CORONAVIRUS ONTO THE

04:52.166 --> 04:53.133
W.H.O., CHINA, AND THE CLOSE

04:53.200 --> 04:54.266
RELATIONSHIP HE CLAIMS

04:54.333 --> 04:55.700
THE TWO HAVE.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.033
AND AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY,

04:57.100 --> 04:57.934
HE TURNED THAT CRITICISM INTO

04:58.000 --> 05:00.433
REAL ACTION.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.867
>> IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC,

05:01.934 --> 05:02.734
DONALD TRUMP IS FORMALLY PULLING

05:02.800 --> 05:03.900
OUT OF THE WORLD HEALTH

05:03.967 --> 05:05.333
ORGANIZATION.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.333
>> WE WILL BE TODAY TERMINATING

05:08.400 --> 05:09.133
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD

05:09.200 --> 05:11.000
HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND

05:11.066 --> 05:13.100
REDIRECTING THOSE FUNDS TO OTHER

05:13.166 --> 05:14.533
WORLDWIDE AND DESERVING URGENT

05:14.600 --> 05:21.533
GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.400
>> John: NOW, THAT IS VERY BAD

05:22.467 --> 05:23.400
NEWS, BUT DO SPARE A THOUGHT

05:23.467 --> 05:24.500
FOR MELANIA, WHO MUST'VE HEARD

05:24.567 --> 05:25.800
THE SENTENCE, "WE WILL BE TODAY

05:25.867 --> 05:26.433
TERMINATING OUR RELATIONSHIP,"

05:26.500 --> 05:27.300
AND, FOR THE BRIEFEST OF

05:27.367 --> 05:30.066
MOMENTS, FELT HOPE.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.700
EXCEPT, I'M TOTALLY KIDDING,

05:31.767 --> 05:33.467
SPARE NO THOUGHTS FOR HER --

05:33.533 --> 05:34.500
SHE'S NOT A BABY.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.367
SHE'S TOTALLY COMPLICIT,

05:35.433 --> 05:35.967
AND NEVER FORGET THAT SHE ONCE

05:36.033 --> 05:36.567
SAID, "WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT

05:36.633 --> 05:37.800
CHRISTMAS STUFF AND

05:37.867 --> 05:38.567
DECORATIONS?," AN ATTITUDE

05:38.633 --> 05:39.800
FULLY PRESENT IN HER HOLIDAY

05:39.867 --> 05:40.533
THEME, BEST DESCRIBED AS,

05:40.600 --> 05:41.333
"WHAT IF TREES GOT PERIODS

05:41.400 --> 05:43.433
AND HATED YOU?"

05:43.500 --> 05:44.934
THE POINT IS, IN THE MIDST OF

05:45.000 --> 05:46.467
EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING THROUGH

05:46.533 --> 05:48.233
RIGHT NOW, TRUMP HAS DECIDED TO

05:48.300 --> 05:50.100
WITHDRAW THE UNITED STATES FROM

05:50.166 --> 05:51.233
THE W.H.O.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.100
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "SURELY,

05:52.166 --> 05:53.734
HE CAN'T DO THAT, RIGHT?"

05:53.800 --> 06:00.900
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE W.H.O.'S

06:00.967 --> 06:02.533
CONSTITUTION DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY

06:02.600 --> 06:03.066
PROVISIONS FOR MEMBERS TO

06:03.133 --> 06:03.900
WITHDRAW.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.700
THE BAD NEWS IS, THERE IS

06:05.767 --> 06:06.600
EXACTLY ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT

06:06.667 --> 06:08.900
RULE AND IF THE UNITED STATES,

06:08.967 --> 06:10.200
WHICH PASSED A RESOLUTION

06:10.266 --> 06:11.800
DECADES AGO SPECIFYING WE

06:11.867 --> 06:12.834
ACTUALLY CAN WITHDRAW AFTER

06:12.900 --> 06:13.500
GIVING ONE YEAR'S NOTICE.

06:13.567 --> 06:14.433
AND THAT'S A PRETTY WEIRD PERK

06:14.500 --> 06:15.367
FOR AMERICA ALONE TO HAVE.

06:15.433 --> 06:16.734
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT WE

06:16.800 --> 06:17.767
DEMANDED TO BE THE ONLY COUNTRY

06:17.834 --> 06:18.900
ALLOWED TO WAX THE PUBES OF

06:18.967 --> 06:20.233
EVERY SQUIRREL.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.300
WHY WOULD WE WANT THE RIGHT TO

06:21.367 --> 06:22.834
DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

06:22.900 --> 06:24.033
AND MORE TO THE POINT,

06:24.100 --> 06:25.533
WHY WOULD WE EVER CONSIDER

06:25.600 --> 06:31.367
ACTUALLY DOING IT?

06:31.433 --> 06:32.467
AND THE THING IS, TRUMP IS NOT

06:32.533 --> 06:33.333
BLUFFING.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.467
HE'S ALREADY SUBMITTED A NOTICE

06:34.533 --> 06:35.367
OF WITHDRAWAL TO THE U.N.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.000
TO TAKE EFFECT NEXT JULY,

06:37.066 --> 06:38.333
SO THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.700
AND GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOW ON

06:39.767 --> 06:41.033
TRACK TO LEAVE THE W.H.O. IN

06:41.100 --> 06:42.500
LESS THAN A YEAR, TONIGHT, LET'S

06:42.567 --> 06:44.367
TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY

06:44.433 --> 06:47.567
MEANS -- HOW IMPORTANT THE

06:47.633 --> 06:48.700
W.H.O.'S WORK IS, HOW VALID

06:48.767 --> 06:50.200
CRITICISMS OF IT ARE, AND WHAT

06:50.266 --> 06:51.100
WE MIGHT BE PUTTING AT STAKE.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.333
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT

06:52.400 --> 06:54.066
THE W.H.O. DOES.

06:54.133 --> 06:57.133
IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1948 AND HAS

06:57.200 --> 06:58.767
SINCE GROWN TO 194 MEMBER STATES

06:58.834 --> 07:00.100
-- THAT'S NEARLY EVERY COUNTRY

07:00.166 --> 07:02.033
ON EARTH.

07:02.100 --> 07:03.500
AND VERY BROADLY, IT COORDINATES

07:03.567 --> 07:05.900
GLOBAL RESPONSES TO A WIDE RANGE

07:05.967 --> 07:07.133
OF HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING

07:07.200 --> 07:08.600
ALERTING THE WORLD TO THREATS,

07:08.667 --> 07:09.834
FIGHTING DISEASES, DEVELOPING

07:09.900 --> 07:11.066
POLICY, AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO

07:11.133 --> 07:13.400
CARE.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.834
ONE OF THE BIGGEST POWERS IT HAS

07:14.900 --> 07:17.266
IS THE ABILITY TO DECLARE

07:17.333 --> 07:18.767
A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF

07:18.834 --> 07:19.967
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN AND ISSUE

07:20.033 --> 07:21.266
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW COUNTRIES

07:21.333 --> 07:22.367
SHOULD RESPOND.

07:22.433 --> 07:23.934
BUT -- AND THIS IS REALLY

07:24.000 --> 07:26.300
IMPORTANT -- IT HAS ABSOLUTELY

07:26.367 --> 07:27.500
NO POWER ON ITS OWN TO ENFORCE

07:27.567 --> 07:29.734
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.033
IT CAN ONLY ACT WITHIN A COUNTRY

07:31.100 --> 07:32.266
TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNTRY

07:32.333 --> 07:33.934
ALLOWS IT TO.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.700
AND YET, DESPITE THOSE

07:35.767 --> 07:37.100
SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS,

07:37.166 --> 07:38.900
IT'S MANAGED TO DO SOME

07:38.967 --> 07:40.133
INCREDIBLE THINGS IN THE PAST,

07:40.200 --> 07:41.400
WITH PERHAPS ITS MOST NOTABLE

07:41.467 --> 07:42.700
SUCCESS BEING THIS.

07:42.767 --> 07:46.667
>> TODAY, A SUBSTANTIAL

07:46.734 --> 07:47.600
MILESTONE IN HUMAN HISTORY.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.266
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

07:49.333 --> 07:50.166
SAYS SMALLPOX HAS NOW BEEN WIPED

07:50.233 --> 07:51.900
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND

07:51.967 --> 07:53.734
WILL NEVER RETURN.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.533
IT SAYS IT'LL NEVER RETURN

07:55.600 --> 07:57.200
BECAUSE SMALLPOX CAN ONLY BE

07:57.266 --> 07:58.767
CAUGHT FROM ANOTHER PERSON,

07:58.834 --> 07:59.934
AND IF NO OTHER PERSON HAS IT,

08:00.000 --> 08:00.533
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO CATCH

08:00.600 --> 08:01.467
IT.

08:01.533 --> 08:03.700
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.600
THE W.H.O. COMPLETELY ERADICATED

08:05.667 --> 08:06.834
SMALLPOX, WHICH KILLED

08:06.900 --> 08:07.867
300 MILLION PEOPLE

08:07.934 --> 08:10.333
IN THE 20TH CENTURY ALONE.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.567
IN THE SPACE OF A DECADE,

08:12.633 --> 08:15.100
IT TOOK SMALLPOX FROM 10 MILLION

08:15.166 --> 08:16.900
CASES AND 2 MILLION DEATHS A

08:16.967 --> 08:18.233
YEAR ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.033
AND IT'S AMAZING THAT SOMETHING

08:20.100 --> 08:21.567
CAN GO FROM BEING THAT

08:21.633 --> 08:22.533
WIDESPREAD TO COMPLETELY

08:22.600 --> 08:24.667
DISAPPEARING WITHIN A FEW YEARS.

08:24.734 --> 08:26.033
SMALLPOX IS BASICALLY THE

08:26.100 --> 08:26.867
CIRCUIT CITY OF INFECTIOUS

08:26.934 --> 08:29.133
DISEASES.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.867
AND IT'S EQUALLY AS MISSED.

08:30.934 --> 08:32.533
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE W.H.O. DID

08:32.600 --> 08:34.000
THIS WITH A MAGIC WAND; IT TOOK

08:34.066 --> 08:35.265
A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK.

08:35.332 --> 08:36.633
NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE TO

08:36.700 --> 08:38.299
ARRANGE A COLLABORATION BETWEEN

08:38.366 --> 08:40.633
AMERICA AND THE U.S.S.R., AT THE

08:40.700 --> 08:42.000
HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR, ONE OF

08:42.066 --> 08:43.332
THE LAST BIG COUNTRIES WHERE

08:43.400 --> 08:44.767
SMALLPOX HAD TO BE TACKLED WAS

08:44.834 --> 08:46.333
INDIA, AND JUST LISTEN TO ONE OF

08:46.400 --> 08:47.533
THE DOCTORS INVOLVED IN THE

08:47.600 --> 08:49.066
EFFORT EXPLAIN WHAT IT TOOK.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.400
>> TO ERADICATE SMALLPOX,

08:51.467 --> 08:53.500
IT MEANT THAT WE WOULD HAVE

08:53.567 --> 08:54.867
TO VISIT EVERY SINGLE HOUSE IN

08:54.934 --> 08:56.367
INDIA.

08:56.433 --> 08:59.800
AND ULTIMATELY, WE DID.

08:59.867 --> 09:02.633
WE VISITED 120 MILLION HOUSES

09:02.700 --> 09:04.867
IN INDIA EVERY MONTH FOR ABOUT

09:04.934 --> 09:07.533
20 MONTHS.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.767
WE DID MORE THAN A BILLION HOUSE

09:08.834 --> 09:09.233
CALLS.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.233
>> John: THINK ABOUT THAT!

09:11.300 --> 09:15.133
THEY VISITED A BILLION HOUSES!

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
THAT'S REMARKABLE.

09:16.266 --> 09:17.533
IT'S ONLY A FEW MORE HOUSES

09:17.600 --> 09:18.100
THAN CHRISHELL VISITED ON

09:18.166 --> 09:19.200
"SELLING SUNSET."

09:19.266 --> 09:20.533
AND THAT'S WHY SHE'S THE BEST.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.800
YOU POUND THE PAVEMENT.

09:21.867 --> 09:22.767
YOU GET THE LISTINGS AND YOU GET

09:22.834 --> 09:23.700
THE RESULTS.

09:23.767 --> 09:24.667
I DON'T KNOW WHERE CHRISHELL

09:24.734 --> 09:25.567
HUSTLES MORE,

09:25.633 --> 09:26.367
ON THE STREETS OF L.A. OR ON

09:26.433 --> 09:27.000
THE "DANCING WITH THE STARS"

09:27.066 --> 09:28.533
DANCE FLOOR.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.300
#TeamChrishell.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.533
BUT THE W.H.O.'S WORK ISN'T

09:32.600 --> 09:34.000
ALWAYS AS LOFTY AS DOOR-TO-DOOR

09:34.066 --> 09:35.533
DISEASE DESTRUCTION.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.667
SOME OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT WORK

09:36.734 --> 09:37.800
INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF

09:37.867 --> 09:39.633
THE SEASONAL FLU VACCINE.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.834
TWICE A YEAR, IT CONVENES

09:41.900 --> 09:42.934
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL OVER

09:43.000 --> 09:44.400
THE WORLD TO DETERMINE WHAT

09:44.467 --> 09:45.467
STRAINS OF THE FLU VIRUS SHOULD

09:45.533 --> 09:47.667
GO INTO THE ANNUAL FLU SHOT.

09:47.734 --> 09:49.200
WHICH MIGHT SOUND TEDIOUS --

09:49.266 --> 09:50.200
BECAUSE IT IS -- BUT IT'S ALSO

09:50.266 --> 09:52.166
KIND OF IMPORTANT.

09:52.233 --> 09:53.300
THAT, BY THE WAY, WAS THE

09:53.367 --> 09:55.834
ORIGINAL TITLE FOR THIS SHOW.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.367
THE W.H.O. IS ALSO CURRENTLY

09:57.433 --> 09:58.967
TRACKING AND RESPONDING TO

09:59.033 --> 10:00.233
DOZENS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE

10:00.300 --> 10:01.400
OUTBREAKS AROUND THE WORLD,

10:01.467 --> 10:02.834
INCLUDING MONKEYPOX,

10:02.900 --> 10:05.367
YELLOW FEVER, AND AN ONGOING

10:05.433 --> 10:05.734
EBOLA OUTBREAK.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.600
AND WHEN, LET'S SAY,

10:06.667 --> 10:08.266
HYPOTHETICALLY, A PANDEMIC

10:08.333 --> 10:10.567
BREAKS OUT, THE ORGANIZATION

10:10.633 --> 10:12.834
CAN PROVIDE A CRITICAL ROLE

10:12.900 --> 10:14.200
AS A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF

10:14.266 --> 10:15.333
INFORMATION, CONDUCTING

10:15.400 --> 10:16.767
INVESTIGATIONS, AND RELEASING

10:16.834 --> 10:19.800
INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC.

10:19.867 --> 10:20.700
AND IT DOES ALL OF THIS

10:20.767 --> 10:22.033
ON A CURRENT BUDGET OF

10:22.100 --> 10:23.934
$2.4 BILLION A YEAR.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.300
WHICH MIGHT SOUND LIKE A LOT,

10:25.367 --> 10:26.600
BUT IT'S AROUND THE SAME AMOUNT

10:26.667 --> 10:28.300
IT COSTS TO RUN A SINGLE

10:28.367 --> 10:29.266
U.S. HOSPITAL.

10:29.333 --> 10:30.700
WHICH IS WILD.

10:30.767 --> 10:32.767
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT THE

10:32.834 --> 10:34.033
U.S. NAVY RUNS ON THE SAME

10:34.100 --> 10:34.934
BUDGET AS TYPHOON LAGOON AT

10:35.000 --> 10:36.200
DISNEY WORLD.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.500
I'M NOT SURE IF TYPHOON LAGOON'S

10:38.567 --> 10:39.500
BUDGET IS WAY TOO HIGH, OR THE

10:39.567 --> 10:41.066
NAVY'S IS WAY TOO LOW, BUT

10:41.133 --> 10:42.433
SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY OFF

10:42.500 --> 10:44.834
THERE.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.734
SO AT ITS BEST, THE W.H.O. DOES

10:46.800 --> 10:48.233
VITALLY IMPORTANT WORK FOR

10:48.300 --> 10:50.200
SHOCKINGLY LITTLE MONEY.

10:50.266 --> 10:51.033
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S

10:51.100 --> 10:53.066
PERFECT.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.567
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CRITICISMS

10:54.633 --> 10:56.100
OF HOW IT'S BEHAVED IN THE PAST,

10:56.166 --> 10:57.734
AMONG THEM THAT DURING THE EBOLA

10:57.800 --> 10:59.133
OUTBREAK IN 2014, THEY ACTED TOO

10:59.200 --> 11:00.533
SLOWLY TO DECLARE A PUBLIC

11:00.600 --> 11:02.100
HEALTH EMERGENCY, WHICH HAD

11:02.166 --> 11:05.200
MAJOR CONSEQUENCES.

11:05.266 --> 11:06.834
BUT THE TRUTH IS, FOR TRUMP,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.100
PAST PERFORMANCE ISN'T REALLY

11:08.166 --> 11:09.533
THE ISSUE HERE.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.533
FOR HIM, THERE ARE TWO

11:10.600 --> 11:11.533
INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEMS

11:11.600 --> 11:12.867
WITH THE W.H.O.

11:12.934 --> 11:14.200
THE FIRST IS HOW MUCH OF ITS

11:14.266 --> 11:16.633
BUDGET THE U.S. PAYS.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.433
>> WE PAY $400 TO $500 MILLION

11:18.500 --> 11:22.000
A YEAR.

11:22.066 --> 11:23.300
CHINA'S PAYING $38, $39,

11:23.367 --> 11:25.033
AND $40 MILLION A YEAR.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.166
AND IT'S LIKE THEY CONTROL THIS

11:26.233 --> 11:28.533
GROUP.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.800
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY BAD

11:29.867 --> 11:30.300
GOING ON.

11:30.367 --> 11:31.600
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:31.667 --> 11:32.934
I'VE GOTTEN VERY MUCH INVOLVED.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.467
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG

11:34.533 --> 11:35.900
PERIOD OF TIME, AND WE DON'T

11:35.967 --> 11:38.533
WANT TO BE THE SUCKERS ANYMORE.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.567
>> John: NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY

11:39.633 --> 11:40.467
ALREADY ASSUMING IT'S MORE

11:40.533 --> 11:41.400
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.734
AND IT IS.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.033
THE PROBLEM IS, TRUMP IS

11:44.100 --> 11:45.367
INCAPABLE OF ACKNOWLEDGING

11:45.433 --> 11:46.567
NUANCE.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.000
IN HIS WORLD, YOU'RE EITHER

11:48.066 --> 11:48.667
FUCKING SOMEONE, OR YOU'RE

11:48.734 --> 11:49.967
GETTING FUCKED.

11:50.033 --> 11:51.100
AND THAT'S NOT A GREAT

11:51.166 --> 11:52.333
PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO

11:52.400 --> 11:54.467
COOPERATING ON GLOBAL HEALTH.

11:54.533 --> 11:56.066
IT'S NOT EVEN A GREAT

11:56.133 --> 11:57.934
PERSPECTIVE AT AN ORGY.

11:58.000 --> 11:58.800
SURE, THERE'S A LOT OF BOTH

11:58.867 --> 12:00.166
GOING ON, BUT THOSE CAN'T BE

12:00.233 --> 12:01.934
THE ONLY OPTIONS.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.934
SOMEONE'S GOTTA MAKE SURE

12:03.000 --> 12:04.600
EVERYONE'S STAYING HYDRATED,

12:04.667 --> 12:06.100
SOMEONE'S GOTTA BE AVAILABLE

12:06.166 --> 12:06.734
TO TIP THE PIZZA DELIVERY

12:06.800 --> 12:08.000
PERSON, SOMEONE'S GOT TO

12:08.066 --> 12:08.800
DISINFECT THE COFFEE TABLE

12:08.867 --> 12:10.467
AFTERWARDS.

12:10.533 --> 12:12.333
IT CAN'T ALL BE JUST FUCKING AND

12:12.400 --> 12:13.934
GETTING FUCKED, OR THERE'S GOING

12:14.000 --> 12:14.567
TO BE CHAOS.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.934
THAT'S BASIC ORGY MANAGEMENT.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.500
NOW WHAT IS TRUE IN TRUMP'S

12:21.567 --> 12:22.533
ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE'S A BIG

12:22.600 --> 12:23.333
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT

12:23.400 --> 12:24.233
THE U.S. AND CHINA GIVE TO

12:24.300 --> 12:27.000
THE W.H.O.

12:27.066 --> 12:28.500
IN 2019, THE U.S. PAID JUST OVER

12:28.567 --> 12:30.967
$446 MILLION.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.834
AND CHINA, THE SECOND LARGEST

12:32.900 --> 12:33.967
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, PAID

12:34.033 --> 12:37.967
JUST $43 MILLION.

12:38.033 --> 12:40.500
THAT IS A STRIKING DISPARITY.

12:40.567 --> 12:41.600
BUT IT'S ROOTED IN HOW

12:41.667 --> 12:42.900
THE W.H.O. IS FUNDED.

12:42.967 --> 12:46.367
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, ONLY AROUND

12:46.433 --> 12:47.800
17% OF ITS FUNDING COMES THROUGH

12:47.867 --> 12:49.200
ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS,

12:49.266 --> 12:50.166
WHICH ARE BASICALLY MEMBERSHIP

12:50.233 --> 12:51.266
DUES BASED ON THE SIZE OF EACH

12:51.333 --> 12:52.266
COUNTRY'S ECONOMY AND

12:52.333 --> 12:53.934
POPULATION.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.767
ALMOST ALL OF THE REST COMES

12:54.834 --> 12:56.266
THROUGH VOLUNTARY

12:56.333 --> 12:57.734
CONTRIBUTIONS.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.734
THAT'S WHERE A COUNTRY DONATES

12:59.800 --> 13:01.567
MONEY, BUT IN DOING SO, CAN

13:01.633 --> 13:02.600
EARMARK EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT

13:02.667 --> 13:04.266
IT USED FOR.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.867
AND MOST OF WHAT THE U.S. PAYS

13:05.934 --> 13:07.400
EACH YEAR IS VOLUNTARY

13:07.467 --> 13:09.300
CONTRIBUTIONS, WHEREAS CHINA

13:09.367 --> 13:12.333
CHOOSES TO PAY ALMOST NOTHING.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.633
AND YOU COULD ARGUE THIS IS A

13:13.700 --> 13:16.900
DUMB WAY TO FUND AN

13:16.967 --> 13:18.000
ORGANIZATION; IT'S ESSENTIALLY

13:18.066 --> 13:18.934
THE GLOBAL HEALTH EQUIVALENT OF

13:19.000 --> 13:20.033
UNDERFUNDING A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND

13:20.100 --> 13:21.133
EXPECTING IT TO HOLD A BAKE SALE

13:21.200 --> 13:22.967
TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE.

13:23.033 --> 13:24.233
BUT THE THING IS, THIS WHOLE

13:24.300 --> 13:26.300
MESS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY

13:26.367 --> 13:28.033
AMERICA'S FAULT.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.000
BACK IN THE 1980s,

13:30.066 --> 13:32.200
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION PUSHED

13:32.266 --> 13:33.767
A ZERO-GROWTH POLICY FOR

13:33.834 --> 13:35.200
THE W.H.O.'S BUDGET, WHICH

13:35.266 --> 13:36.533
EVENTUALLY FROZE STATES'

13:36.600 --> 13:37.834
ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS AT

13:37.900 --> 13:40.000
1990s LEVELS.

13:40.066 --> 13:42.033
SO WITH THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS

13:42.100 --> 13:43.433
UNABLE TO GO UP, THE W.H.O. HAS

13:43.500 --> 13:44.934
NATURALLY NEEDED MORE AND MORE

13:45.000 --> 13:46.033
VOLUNTARY DONATIONS

13:46.100 --> 13:51.333
AS THE YEARS HAVE GONE BY.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.066
AND I WOULD SAY THAT WAS THE

13:53.133 --> 13:54.133
WORST DECISION OF THE REAGAN

13:54.200 --> 13:54.834
WHITE HOUSE, WERE IT NOT FOR

13:54.900 --> 13:55.734
IRAN-CONTRA, THE WAR ON DRUGS,

13:55.800 --> 13:56.800
TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, AND

13:56.867 --> 13:57.967
FAILING TO PUBLICLY SAY

13:58.033 --> 13:59.300
THE WORD "AIDS" FOR FOUR YEARS.

13:59.367 --> 14:00.767
I'M NOT SAYING EVERYTHING IS

14:00.834 --> 14:01.800
REAGAN'S FAULT, ALL I'M SAYING

14:01.867 --> 14:03.467
IS, IF I FOUND OUT TOMORROW THAT

14:03.533 --> 14:05.233
MURDER HORNETS ARE ONLY HERE

14:05.300 --> 14:06.867
BECAUSE HE STARTED BREEDING THEM

14:06.934 --> 14:10.367
IN 1988, I CAN'T SAY I'D BE

14:10.433 --> 14:12.266
ENTIRELY SURPRISED.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.600
THE POINT IS, THAT IS WHY WE PAY

14:15.667 --> 14:16.900
SO MUCH RELATIVE TO CHINA.

14:16.967 --> 14:18.100
IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE CHOOSE

14:18.166 --> 14:20.967
TO BECAUSE THE W.H.O. IS

14:21.033 --> 14:22.100
UNDERFUNDED BECAUSE OF

14:22.166 --> 14:23.066
SOMETHING WE DID.

14:23.133 --> 14:25.033
SO WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S SECOND BIG

14:25.100 --> 14:26.533
COMPLAINT, THAT THE W.H.O. IS A

14:26.600 --> 14:27.734
LITERAL PIPE ORGAN FOR CHINA?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.834
WHICH, AGAIN, IT LITERALLY

14:28.900 --> 14:32.033
ISN'T.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.066
THAT IS AN IDEA THAT HE AND HIS

14:33.133 --> 14:34.133
SUPPORTERS HAVE HAMMERED HARD.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.033
>> THE WORLD HEALTH

14:36.100 --> 14:37.800
ORGANIZATION'S SUBSERVIENCE TO

14:37.867 --> 14:38.400
THEIR MASTERS IN BEIJING HAS

14:38.467 --> 14:39.333
ONLY BECOME MORE OBVIOUSLY MORE

14:39.400 --> 14:40.433
NAKED.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.633
>> ALLOWING THE WORLD HEALTH

14:42.700 --> 14:44.266
ORGANIZATION TO INVESTIGATE

14:44.333 --> 14:45.734
CHINA IS LIKE HAVING EL CHAPO

14:45.800 --> 14:46.467
INVESTIGATE THE MEXICAN DRUG

14:46.533 --> 14:48.633
CARTELS.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.233
>> I MEAN, CHINA LIED, THE WORLD

14:50.300 --> 14:52.400
HEALTH ORGANIZATION COMPLIED,

14:52.467 --> 14:53.500
AND AS A RESULT, MANY AMERICANS

14:53.567 --> 14:56.834
DIED.

14:56.900 --> 15:00.867
>> John: OKAY, NOW I KNOW THAT

15:00.934 --> 15:01.667
RHYME SOUNDED COMPELLING,

15:01.734 --> 15:02.367
BUT IT'S

15:02.433 --> 15:03.300
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: NOT

15:03.367 --> 15:04.333
EVERYTHING THAT RHYMES IS TRUE.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.000
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

15:05.066 --> 15:06.133
"IN 1981 JAMES COMER WAS UP TO

15:06.200 --> 15:06.900
NO GOOD, HE STOOD ON A BOAT AND

15:06.967 --> 15:08.133
PUSHED AS HARD AS HE COULD, AND

15:08.200 --> 15:08.734
THAT'S HOW JAMES COMER KILLED

15:08.800 --> 15:10.000
NATALIE WOOD."

15:10.066 --> 15:14.433
THAT'S A FANTASTIC RHYME,

15:14.500 --> 15:15.767
NO QUESTIONS THERE.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.600
BUT I DO HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT IT

15:17.667 --> 15:18.867
MIGHT BE UNTRUE.

15:18.934 --> 15:20.367
WHAT THEY'RE ARGUING THERE IS,

15:20.433 --> 15:20.900
THE W.H.O. MISHANDLED THE

15:20.967 --> 15:21.734
PANDEMIC BECAUSE THEY'RE

15:21.800 --> 15:23.567
DEFERENTIAL TO CHINA.

15:23.633 --> 15:24.500
AND WHILE THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO

15:24.567 --> 15:26.000
EACH HALF OF THAT STATEMENT,

15:26.066 --> 15:28.834
THEY'RE NOT TRUE TOGETHER.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.900
AND LET'S START WITH THE

15:30.967 --> 15:32.767
ALLEGATION THE W.H.O. IS

15:32.834 --> 15:33.500
DEFERENTIAL TO CHINA.

15:33.567 --> 15:34.200
THAT CAN BE TRUE.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.100
FOR INSTANCE, ITS MEMBER STATES

15:35.166 --> 15:36.367
HAVE CONSISTENTLY ACQUIESCED TO

15:36.433 --> 15:38.367
CHINA'S INSISTENCE THAT TAIWAN

15:38.433 --> 15:39.533
NOT BE ALLOWED TO JOIN THE

15:39.600 --> 15:40.800
ORGANIZATION AS A SEPARATE

15:40.867 --> 15:42.433
ENTITY.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.633
AND W.H.O. LEADERSHIP PRAISED

15:44.700 --> 15:46.000
CHINA EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC,

15:46.066 --> 15:47.467
CITING ITS "BOLD APPROACH TO

15:47.533 --> 15:49.467
CONTAIN THE RAPID SPREAD"

15:49.533 --> 15:52.433
OF THE CORONAVIRUS, WHICH

15:52.500 --> 15:54.633
DOES NOT DATE WELL.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.767
ALTHOUGH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO

15:55.834 --> 15:57.333
REMEMBER, THE W.H.O. NEEDS

15:57.400 --> 15:58.567
TO BE EXCEEDINGLY DIPLOMATIC

15:58.633 --> 16:00.633
WITH ITS MEMBER COUNTRIES TO

16:00.700 --> 16:02.200
GAIN THE ACCESS IT NEEDS FOR

16:02.266 --> 16:02.900
ON-THE-GROUND INVESTIGATIONS

16:02.967 --> 16:07.266
AS AN OUTBREAK EMERGES.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.300
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

16:08.367 --> 16:09.500
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS ALONE IN

16:09.567 --> 16:10.400
PRAISING CHINA'S CORONAVIRUS

16:10.467 --> 16:11.266
RESPONSE.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.166
BACK IN FEBRUARY, TRUMP WAS

16:12.233 --> 16:13.834
WORKING OUT A TRADE DEAL WITH

16:13.900 --> 16:14.500
CHINA, AND HE SAID THIS.

16:14.567 --> 16:15.233
>> CHINA IS WORKING VERY, VERY

16:15.300 --> 16:16.233
HARD.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.867
I HAVE SPOKEN TO PRESIDENT XI,

16:17.934 --> 16:20.567
AND THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD.

16:20.633 --> 16:22.600
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM,

16:22.667 --> 16:23.600
I THINK HE'LL BE IN PRETTY GOOD

16:23.667 --> 16:26.333
SHAPE.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.734
THEY'VE HAD A ROUGH PATCH, AND I

16:29.800 --> 16:31.333
THINK RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE IT --

16:31.400 --> 16:32.100
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GETTING IT

16:32.166 --> 16:38.934
UNDER CONTROL MORE AND MORE.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.133
>> John: OH OH, AND THAT WAS

16:41.200 --> 16:42.667
BY NO MEANS A ONE OFF.

16:42.734 --> 16:43.867
TRUMP PRAISED CHINA'S RESPONSE

16:43.934 --> 16:44.734
SO MANY TIMES POLITICO MADE IT

16:44.800 --> 16:45.400
INTO AN ACTUAL LISTICLE AND

16:45.467 --> 16:46.533
THAT'S A SERIOUS UNIT OF

16:46.600 --> 16:47.100
MEASUREMENT.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.066
TRUMP'S JOINING THE RANKS OF

16:48.133 --> 16:49.066
"15 HEDGEHOGS WITH THINGS THAT

16:49.133 --> 16:50.133
LOOK LIKE HEDGEHOGS," OR

16:50.200 --> 16:51.367
"TOP 10 ACTORS WHO DIED IN

16:51.433 --> 16:53.333
FIRES," OR "16 PEOPLE WHO WERE

16:53.400 --> 16:55.300
LITERAL CHILDREN IN 2010 BUT

16:55.367 --> 16:56.567
FULL GROWN ADULTS NOW," WHICH I

16:56.633 --> 16:57.367
ASSUME WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE

16:57.433 --> 16:58.767
WHO JUST EMERGED FROM A COMA

16:58.834 --> 17:01.066
AND FORGOT HOW TIME WORKS,

17:01.133 --> 17:02.367
INCIDENTALLY MAKING THEM

17:02.433 --> 17:03.600
ELIGIBLE FOR "TIME" MAGAZINE'S

17:03.667 --> 17:04.266
VERY REAL LISTICLE,

17:04.333 --> 17:07.567
"TOP 10 COMAS."

17:07.633 --> 17:08.666
NOW, AS FOR THE QUESTION OF

17:08.733 --> 17:09.834
WHETHER THE W.H.O. MADE MISTAKES

17:09.900 --> 17:11.599
EARLY ON, IT DEFINITELY DID.

17:11.666 --> 17:12.633
IT ARGUABLY TOOK TOO LONG TO

17:12.700 --> 17:15.133
ADVISE UNIVERSAL MASK WEARING

17:15.200 --> 17:17.233
AND TO CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGE

17:17.300 --> 17:18.200
THE THREAT OF INDOOR AIRBORNE

17:18.266 --> 17:21.700
TRANSMISSION.

17:21.767 --> 17:22.599
BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL

17:22.666 --> 17:24.433
THAT THIS WAS DONE TO APPEASE

17:24.500 --> 17:26.867
CHINA, SO MUCH AS, IN THE EARLY

17:26.934 --> 17:28.667
STAGES OF A PANDEMIC, EVEN

17:28.734 --> 17:29.967
EXPERTS TEND TO -- TO USE A

17:30.033 --> 17:31.000
TECHNICAL TERM -- NOT KNOW WHAT

17:31.066 --> 17:33.767
THE FUCK IS GOING ON.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.967
BUT LET'S SAY, FOR THE SAKE OF

17:36.033 --> 17:37.600
ARGUMENT, THAT YOU AGREE WITH

17:37.667 --> 17:39.100
THE PRESIDENT THAT WE SIMPLY PAY

17:39.166 --> 17:42.633
TOO MUCH TO THE W.H.O., AND THAT

17:42.700 --> 17:43.266
CHINA IS CALLING ALL THE SHOTS

17:43.333 --> 17:45.734
THERE.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.600
THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES, WHAT

17:46.667 --> 17:47.200
THEN?

17:47.266 --> 17:48.033
AND IF YOU LISTEN TO

17:48.100 --> 17:49.000
MIKE POMPEO, WHICH YOU

17:49.066 --> 17:51.567
ABSOLUTELY NEVER SHOULD,

17:51.633 --> 17:52.600
HE WOULD ARGUE THE U.S. CAN JUST

17:52.667 --> 17:53.367
GO IT ALONE.

17:53.433 --> 17:54.834
>> IF THERE IS A FUNCTION THAT

17:54.900 --> 17:57.200
ONLY THE W.H.O. CAN DO, AND WE

17:57.266 --> 17:58.367
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

17:58.433 --> 18:00.300
AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY OR

18:00.367 --> 18:01.400
BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD HUMANITARIAN

18:01.467 --> 18:02.967
PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD,

18:03.033 --> 18:03.967
I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL FIND A WAY

18:04.033 --> 18:07.667
TO DELIVER THAT OUTCOME.

18:07.734 --> 18:08.333
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS JUST

18:08.400 --> 18:09.233
RIDICULOUS.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.333
THE U.S. CANNOT DO WHAT THE

18:10.400 --> 18:10.900
W.H.O. DOES, FOR MANY, MANY

18:10.967 --> 18:12.633
REASONS.

18:12.700 --> 18:13.967
FOR A START, IF WE TRY AND GO

18:14.033 --> 18:15.700
INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR A

18:15.767 --> 18:16.800
PUBLIC HEALTH MISSION, CHANCES

18:16.867 --> 18:17.600
ARE WE'RE GOING TO GET GREETED

18:17.667 --> 18:18.567
FAR LESS WARMLY.

18:18.633 --> 18:19.967
BECAUSE THE W.H.O. HAS NEVER,

18:20.033 --> 18:21.133
Y'KNOW, INVADED A NATION OR

18:21.200 --> 18:23.233
FUNDED A COUP.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.767
AS ONE FORMER U.S.

18:24.834 --> 18:25.900
REPRESENTATIVE TO THE

18:25.967 --> 18:27.300
ORGANIZATION HAS SAID, "PEOPLE

18:27.367 --> 18:28.767
COMING INTO COUNTRIES IN W.H.O.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.300
SHIRTS TO WORK ON POLIO OR AIDS

18:30.367 --> 18:31.300
ARE LESS THREATENING."

18:31.367 --> 18:33.100
ADDING, "NO ONE IS LOOKING FOR

18:33.166 --> 18:34.934
U.S.-BASED ALTERNATIVES TO

18:35.000 --> 18:37.166
W.H.O."

18:37.233 --> 18:38.700
WHICH, OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT --

18:38.767 --> 18:39.700
ESPECIALLY HAVING SEEN THE WAY

18:39.767 --> 18:40.467
THAT WE'VE HANDLED THE

18:40.533 --> 18:43.367
CORONAVIRUS.

18:43.433 --> 18:44.967
NOBODY WANTS A U.S.-BASED

18:45.033 --> 18:46.266
ALTERNATIVE HERE FOR THE SAME

18:46.333 --> 18:47.367
REASON NOBODY'S LOOKING FOR A

18:47.433 --> 18:48.500
JOE EXOTIC-BASED ALTERNATIVE TO

18:48.567 --> 18:49.433
"JEOPARDY."

18:49.500 --> 18:50.800
I'M NOT SAYING HE DOESN'T THINK

18:50.867 --> 18:52.633
HE CAN DO IT.

18:52.700 --> 18:53.934
BUT EVERYONE LIKES THE WAY IT

18:54.000 --> 18:55.066
WORKS NOW, AND HIS ALTERNATIVE

18:55.133 --> 18:57.100
MIGHT BE ACTIVELY DANGEROUS.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.533
ALSO, WHEN IT COMES TO GLOBAL

18:59.600 --> 19:00.900
HEALTH, THE U.S. HAS A CHECKERED

19:00.967 --> 19:02.633
PAST.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.066
BEFORE THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN,

19:04.133 --> 19:05.467
ONE OF THE WAYS THE U.S.

19:05.533 --> 19:07.300
VERIFIED HE WAS IN ABBOTABAD WAS

19:07.367 --> 19:08.600
BY STAGING A FAKE VACCINATION

19:08.667 --> 19:10.967
CAMPAIGN IN THAT TOWN AS A RUSE

19:11.033 --> 19:12.734
TO GATHER DNA SAMPLES FROM THE

19:12.800 --> 19:14.700
PEOPLE LIVING AT HIS COMPOUND,

19:14.767 --> 19:16.467
SOMETHING WHICH NOT ONLY PUT

19:16.533 --> 19:18.066
HEALTH WORKERS IN THE REGION AT

19:18.133 --> 19:19.300
RISK, BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO A

19:19.367 --> 19:20.800
MAJOR SETBACK IN THE EFFORT TO

19:20.867 --> 19:22.233
VACCINATE PEOPLE IN PAKISTAN

19:22.300 --> 19:25.166
AGAINST POLIO.

19:25.233 --> 19:26.467
AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO

19:26.533 --> 19:28.633
MAKE FRIENDS BY SUDDENLY WALKING

19:28.700 --> 19:30.467
AWAY FROM THE W.H.O. AND CUTTING

19:30.533 --> 19:32.166
OFF ITS FUNDING, ESPECIALLY IN

19:32.233 --> 19:34.533
THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.967
AS ONE OFFICIAL PUTS IT,

19:36.033 --> 19:37.400
THE U.S. DECISION TO LEAVE IS

19:37.467 --> 19:38.233
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET YOUR

19:38.300 --> 19:40.300
HEAD AROUND.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.433
>> AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS

19:41.500 --> 19:43.133
LIKE A BAD DREAM.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.300
AND FOR STAFF INSIDE THE

19:44.367 --> 19:45.300
ORGANIZATION, THEY FEEL

19:45.367 --> 19:46.834
DUMBFOUNDED.

19:46.900 --> 19:47.600
COULD SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME

19:47.667 --> 19:49.400
WHY?

19:49.467 --> 19:52.100
REALLY, WHY?

19:52.166 --> 19:53.133
WHY TAKE THE FIRE ENGINES AWAY

19:53.200 --> 19:53.767
IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHTING A

19:53.834 --> 19:55.066
FIRE?

19:55.133 --> 19:57.567
>> John: EXACTLY!

19:57.633 --> 19:58.567
IT'S TAKING THE FIRE ENGINES

19:58.633 --> 20:00.066
AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHTING

20:00.133 --> 20:01.700
THE FIRE, OR GETTING RID OF

20:01.767 --> 20:03.467
THE LIFEBOATS WHILE THE BOAT IS

20:03.533 --> 20:05.266
SINKING, OR CHOOSING TO EDIT

20:05.333 --> 20:06.900
KEVIN SPACEY INTO A MOVIE JUST

20:06.967 --> 20:08.367
WEEKS BEFORE ITS RELEASE DATE --

20:08.433 --> 20:10.166
IT'S THE WORST POSSIBLE DECISION

20:10.233 --> 20:12.200
AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME.

20:12.266 --> 20:14.700
AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE HERE,

20:14.767 --> 20:16.834
BECAUSE THE W.H.O. IS RIGHT

20:16.900 --> 20:18.533
ON THE EDGE OF DOING TO POLIO

20:18.600 --> 20:19.967
WHAT IT DID TO SMALLPOX AND

20:20.033 --> 20:22.500
ELIMINATING IT.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.200
JUST TWO MONTHS AGO, IT WAS

20:24.266 --> 20:25.867
FINALLY WIPED OUT IN AFRICA,

20:25.934 --> 20:27.333
AND WE ARE NOW 99% OF THE

20:27.400 --> 20:29.266
WAY TO GLOBAL ERADICATION,

20:29.333 --> 20:30.233
WITH A CURRENT GOAL FOR IT

20:30.300 --> 20:33.367
TO HAPPEN IN 2023.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.367
UNFORTUNATELY, THE U.S. IS

20:35.433 --> 20:36.900
THE SECOND LARGEST FUNDER OF

20:36.967 --> 20:38.066
THE GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION

20:38.133 --> 20:39.767
INITIATIVE, AND THAT MONEY

20:39.834 --> 20:40.934
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING IS LIKELY

20:41.000 --> 20:42.533
TO SET EVERYTHING BACK.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.600
AND WHILE IT ALMOST FEELS

20:44.667 --> 20:46.433
INAPPROPRIATE FOR POLIO NOT TO

20:46.500 --> 20:47.667
MAKE A COMEBACK DURING THIS

20:47.734 --> 20:49.600
FUCKING NIGHTMARE OF A YEAR,

20:49.667 --> 20:50.567
WE SHOULD STILL PROBABLY TRY TO

20:50.633 --> 20:53.834
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.667
AND LOOK, IT IS FINE IF THE U.S.

20:55.734 --> 20:56.867
HAS PROBLEMS WITH THE W.H.O.

20:56.934 --> 20:58.900
IT HAS PROBLEMS.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.000
BUT THE SOLUTION CLEARLY ISN'T

21:00.066 --> 21:01.967
TO WALK AWAY.

21:02.033 --> 21:03.333
IT'S TO TRY AND FIX THEM.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.033
BUT THE ONLY WAY FOR THE U.S. TO

21:05.100 --> 21:06.000
HAVE A SAY IN HOW THAT HAPPENS

21:06.066 --> 21:07.867
IS TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.333
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO JUST GIVE

21:09.400 --> 21:10.533
THAT UP.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.834
AND THE THING IS,

21:11.900 --> 21:12.734
THIS IS YET ANOTHER

21:12.800 --> 21:14.000
DEPRESSING EXAMPLE OF TRUMP

21:14.066 --> 21:15.033
SEEING SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES

21:15.100 --> 21:16.800
SHARED SACRIFICE, TRADE-OFFS,

21:16.867 --> 21:18.367
AND COMPLEXITY, AND DECIDING TO

21:18.433 --> 21:20.266
JUST BLOW IT UP, BECAUSE HE

21:20.333 --> 21:21.367
EITHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IT,

21:21.433 --> 21:23.367
DOESN'T CARE, OR BOTH.

21:23.433 --> 21:24.734
WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH

21:24.800 --> 21:26.266
THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT AND

21:26.333 --> 21:27.300
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

21:27.367 --> 21:28.734
AND NOW HE'S DOING IT WITH

21:28.800 --> 21:30.567
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.800
AND THIS IS INCREDIBLY

21:32.867 --> 21:33.066
DANGEROUS.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.433
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, WE'RE

21:34.500 --> 21:36.567
CURRENTLY ON TRACK TO LEAVE THE

21:36.633 --> 21:38.734
W.H.O. ON JULY 6th OF NEXT YEAR

21:38.800 --> 21:40.133
IF, THAT IS, TRUMP IS

21:40.200 --> 21:42.734
RE-ELECTED.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.233
AND THIS MEANS OUR MEMBERSHIP

21:44.300 --> 21:45.600
IN THE W.H.O. IS YET ANOTHER

21:45.667 --> 21:46.800
IMPORTANT THING ON THE BALLOT

21:46.867 --> 21:47.767
THIS YEAR.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.400
AND EVEN THOUGH TRUMP LIKES

21:49.467 --> 21:50.433
TO PRETEND WE CAN INSULATE

21:50.500 --> 21:51.867
OURSELVES FROM THE REST OF

21:51.934 --> 21:52.934
THE WORLD, IF THE CORONAVIRUS

21:53.000 --> 21:54.333
HAS SHOWN US ANYTHING,

21:54.400 --> 21:56.400
IT'S THAT DISEASES DON'T

21:56.467 --> 21:57.467
RECOGNIZE BORDERS, AND WE'RE

21:57.533 --> 21:58.667
ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR

21:58.734 --> 22:01.233
WORST-PREPARED COUNTRY.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.133
AND PULLING OUT OF THE W.H.O. AT

22:03.200 --> 22:06.100
ANY TIME, BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE

22:06.166 --> 22:07.533
MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT'S

22:07.600 --> 22:09.100
KILLED OVER 200,000 AMERICANS

23:12.233 --> 23:13.533
YOU MAY REMEMBER, A FEW MONTHS

23:13.600 --> 23:14.300
AGO, WE INSULTED THE UNASSUMING

23:14.367 --> 23:14.900
CITY OF DANBURY FOR NO CLEAR

23:14.967 --> 23:15.800
REASON.

23:15.867 --> 23:17.500
AND THE CITIZENS THERE

23:17.567 --> 23:18.367
RESPONDED, WITH MULTIPLE

23:18.433 --> 23:20.066
DANBURIANS INSULTING ME IN

23:22.066 --> 23:23.100
DECLARING THAT HE'D NAME THEIR

23:23.166 --> 23:25.600
SEWAGE PLANT "THE JOHN OLIVER

23:25.667 --> 23:26.800

23:26.867 --> 23:27.934
IT'S FULL OF SHIT JUST LIKE ME.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.533
ALL OF WHICH WAS EXCELLENT.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.433
DISAPPOINTINGLY, THE MAYOR THEN

23:31.500 --> 23:32.066
CLAIMED HIS THREAT WAS JUST

23:32.133 --> 23:32.900
A JOKE.

23:32.967 --> 23:34.767
SO TO TRY TO FORCE HIS HAND,

23:34.834 --> 23:36.266
WE OFFERED TO DONATE $55,000 TO

23:36.333 --> 23:37.433

>> THE COMMUNITY SPIRIT THIS

23:58.600 --> 23:59.533
FEUD HAS GENERATED IS

23:59.600 --> 24:00.767
PRICELESS.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.200
>> A VOTE GOT PUSHED TO THURSDAY

24:02.266 --> 24:02.834

24:02.900 --> 24:04.266
ARE THERE.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.500
OPERATE.

24:17.567 --> 24:18.433

24:20.400 --> 24:21.433

24:21.500 --> 24:22.567
FROM TO THE TOWN'S SEEMING

24:22.633 --> 24:23.367
ENTHUSIASM, TO THE FACT THAT

24:23.433 --> 24:24.433
THE MAYOR SEEMS TO THINK

24:24.500 --> 24:25.867
WATCHING WATER FILTRATION IS

24:25.934 --> 24:27.500
A MUST-SEE THRILL RIDE.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.667
NO ONE ENJOYS SITTING IN

24:28.734 --> 24:29.734
BLEACHERS WATCHING RAW SEWAGE

24:29.800 --> 24:30.633
MOVE AROUND.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.800
JUST ASK ANY FAN OF

24:31.867 --> 24:33.367
THE NEW YORK GIANTS.

24:33.433 --> 24:34.967
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH FEW SEASONS.

24:35.033 --> 24:36.800
BUT THE FACT IS, THINGS HAVE

24:36.867 --> 24:37.800
ESCALATED HERE.

24:37.867 --> 24:38.867
LOCAL BUSINESSES STARTED

24:38.934 --> 24:39.834
A FUNDRAISER SUPPORTING THE

24:39.900 --> 24:42.066
EFFORT, AND HAVE SO FAR RAISED

24:42.133 --> 24:43.734
$45,000 FOR AREA FOOD BANKS.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.100
DANBURY'S LOCAL HOCKEY TEAM HAS

24:45.166 --> 24:46.333
BEEN SELLING SPECIAL HAT TRICKS

24:46.400 --> 24:48.100
T-SHIRTS BENEFITING ALS

24:48.166 --> 24:48.934
CONNECTICUT WITH THE NAME OF

24:49.000 --> 24:50.200
THE CHARACTER I PLAYED IN 2008'S

24:50.266 --> 24:51.333
"THE LOVE GURU."

24:51.400 --> 24:52.667
AND MAYOR MARK IS EVEN OFFERING

24:52.734 --> 24:54.233
TO GIVE PERSONAL TOURS OF THE

24:54.300 --> 24:55.600
SEWER PLANT FOR $500 APIECE --

24:55.667 --> 24:57.233
AGAIN, ALL FOR CHARITY.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.133
IT'S ALL BEEN GOING VERY WELL.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.600
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THERE,

25:00.667 --> 25:02.333
THE VOTE WAS POSTPONED UNTIL

25:02.400 --> 25:03.800
LAST THURSDAY, WHICH IS HOW I

25:03.867 --> 25:05.200
FOUND MYSELF AT HOME, WATCHING

25:05.266 --> 25:06.333
DANBURY CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS ON

25:06.400 --> 25:07.533
ZOOM WITH BATED BREATH.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.667
AND I WILL SAY, SOME MEMBERS

25:08.734 --> 25:10.400
EXPRESSED CONCERNS.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.400
>> WHILE I APPRECIATE THE HUMOR

25:12.467 --> 25:14.900
DURING A TIME WHEN WE COULD ALL

25:14.967 --> 25:16.600
USE A LAUGH, I'D HAVE TO SAY

25:16.667 --> 25:18.133
THAT I PERSONALLY DON'T FIND

25:18.200 --> 25:19.800
ANYTHING FUNNY ABOUT INSULTING

25:19.867 --> 25:21.400
OUR COMMUNITY, AND LEAST OF ALL,

25:21.467 --> 25:22.767
ABOUT THREATENING VIOLENCE

25:22.834 --> 25:23.600
TOWARDS CHILDREN.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.200
I'M JUST GONNA BE VOTING NO.

25:25.266 --> 25:25.834
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.066
THAT'S FAIR.

25:27.133 --> 25:28.600
I DID INVITE ALL DANBURIANS

25:28.667 --> 25:29.967
TO COME GET A THRASHING FROM ME,

25:30.033 --> 25:30.800
CHILDREN INCLUDED.

25:30.867 --> 25:32.066
ALTHOUGH IN MY DEFENSE, I'M

25:32.133 --> 25:33.233
CLEARLY NO THREAT TO ANYBODY.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.367
I HAVE THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF

25:34.433 --> 25:35.934
AL DENTE SPAGHETTI.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.900
IF I WAS WAS A BOXER, MY WEIGHT

25:36.967 --> 25:38.300
CLASS WOULD BE "NOT DETECTED,"

25:38.367 --> 25:38.967
AND MY ENTRANCE MUSIC WOULD BE

25:39.033 --> 25:41.066
NORMA JEAN'S "PLEASE DON'T

25:41.133 --> 25:41.333
HURT ME."

25:41.400 --> 25:43.400
I AM FRAGILE.

25:43.467 --> 25:44.767
AND THAT MAN WAS NOT THE ONLY

25:44.834 --> 25:46.000
ONE WITH QUALMS.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.900
>> I'M REALLY PROUD OF OUR

25:47.967 --> 25:48.934
WASTE TREATMENT PLANT.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.066
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID

25:51.133 --> 25:52.934
YEARS AGO WHEN I GOT ON THE

25:53.000 --> 25:53.900
COUNCIL, ALONG WITH

25:53.967 --> 25:54.700
COUNCILMAN CHIANESE,

25:54.767 --> 25:56.166
IS ORGANIZE A TOUR,

25:56.233 --> 25:58.400
AND WE TOOK A TOUR OF THE PLANT.

25:58.467 --> 25:59.400
AND I WAS AGOG.

25:59.467 --> 26:00.867
I THOUGHT IT WAS, LIKE, THIS

26:00.934 --> 26:02.000
AMAZING MACHINE THAT TURNS,

26:02.066 --> 26:03.000
YOU KNOW, STUFF YOU DON'T REALLY

26:03.066 --> 26:05.567
WANT ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE

26:05.633 --> 26:06.300
INTO SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

26:06.367 --> 26:08.400
DRINK OR ALMOST DRINK.

26:08.467 --> 26:11.767
SO I, YOU KNOW, WHEN I HEARD WE

26:11.834 --> 26:13.767
WERE NAMING THAT MACHINE THAT'S

26:13.834 --> 26:14.633
INTEGRAL TO THE COMMUNITY AFTER

26:14.700 --> 26:17.667
THIS GUY, I -- NO WAY.

26:17.734 --> 26:18.333
>> John: GOD, I LOVE

26:18.400 --> 26:20.000
CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.433
TALK ABOUT THE TIME THEY WERE

STRUCK SPEECHLESS BY

26:23.300 --> 26:24.333
THE SHEER BEAUTY OF

MUNICIPAL WASTE FILTRATION?

26:26.633 --> 26:28.500
ALTHOUGH HE DOES GLOSS PRETTY

26:28.567 --> 26:29.300
QUICKLY OVER THE DIFFERENCE

26:29.367 --> 26:30.033
BETWEEN "WATER YOU CAN DRINK"

26:30.100 --> 26:31.000
AND "WATER YOU CAN ALMOST

26:31.066 --> 26:32.033
DRINK."

26:32.100 --> 26:32.767
YOU CAN ALMOST DRINK A LOT OF

26:32.834 --> 26:33.667
THINGS!

26:33.734 --> 26:34.834
MERCURY, ANTIFREEZE,

26:34.900 --> 26:36.133
MOUNTAIN DEW.

26:36.200 --> 26:36.934
"ALMOST" CAN DO A LOT OF

26:37.000 --> 26:39.033
HEAVY LIFTING.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.300
ALTHOUGH, I AM HAPPY TO SAY

26:40.367 --> 26:41.800
THAT MAN EVENTUALLY VOTED YES,

26:41.867 --> 26:42.767
ALTHOUGH IN DOING SO, SAID HE

26:42.834 --> 26:44.200
HOPED I'D "COME TO TERMS WITH

26:44.266 --> 26:45.467
THE STATEMENTS I MADE

26:45.533 --> 26:46.934
TOWARDS DANBURY."

26:47.000 --> 26:48.400
WHICH I ABSOLUTELY HAVE, AND I

26:48.467 --> 26:50.667
REGRET NOTHING.

26:50.734 --> 26:54.400
BUT LOOK, THE MEETING CULMINATED

26:54.467 --> 26:55.333
IN A NAIL-BITING ROLL-CALL VOTE,

26:55.400 --> 26:56.567
AFTER WHICH, THE RESULTS CAME

26:56.633 --> 26:57.100
IN.

26:57.166 --> 26:58.200
>> WE HAVE 18 YESES,

26:58.266 --> 26:59.567
ONE ABSTENTION, AND ONE NAY.

26:59.633 --> 27:02.467
CONGRATULATIONS, MR. OLIVER!

27:02.533 --> 27:03.667
YOU NOW HAVE A POOP PLANT NAMED

27:03.734 --> 27:04.166
AFTER YOU.

27:04.233 --> 27:05.333
>> WHOO!

27:05.400 --> 27:07.867
>> John: YES!

27:07.934 --> 27:09.300
THAT IS AMAZING.

27:09.367 --> 27:10.467
AND HONESTLY, I DO BELIEVE THAT

27:10.533 --> 27:13.567
I WAS THEIR BEST OPTION.

27:13.633 --> 27:14.300
WHO ELSE WERE THEY GONNA NAME IT

27:14.367 --> 27:15.133
AFTER?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.033
NEIL CAVUTO?

27:16.100 --> 27:17.633
YEAH, HE'S TECHNICALLY FROM

27:17.700 --> 27:17.867
DANBURY.

27:17.934 --> 27:18.400
BUT HE ALREADY HAS A SHIT

27:18.467 --> 27:19.367
FACTORY NAMED AFTER HIM, AND

27:19.433 --> 27:20.500
IT'S CALLED "YOUR WORLD WITH

27:20.567 --> 27:21.166
NEIL CAVUTO."

27:21.233 --> 27:21.934
SO THE RESOLUTION PASSED,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.233
ALTHOUGH THE MAYOR DID HAVE ONE

27:23.300 --> 27:24.166
CONDITION: THAT THEY WOULD MAKE

27:24.233 --> 27:25.533
IT OFFICIAL "ONLY IF THE

WHICH, HONESTLY, IS A PRETTY BIG
