WEBVTT

00:05.639 --> 00:07.306
that consumed your thoughts?

00:11.445 --> 00:14.480
Made everything and everyone
else just disappear?

00:18.486 --> 00:21.153
How can you settle for
anything less after that?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.732
I don't understand
what you're saying.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.605
What the hell is
the matter with you?

00:43.077 --> 00:43.936
Hey!

00:48.449 --> 00:50.282
You gotta hold still,
I'm trying to help you.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.717
Get away!

00:51.719 --> 00:53.786
Look, I did not know she was
gonna bet there all right.

00:53.788 --> 00:54.620
No.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.355
I swear to God.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.157
Oh, Vincent, did you really
write that scene for me?

00:58.159 --> 01:00.459
You're just fucking
exaggerating now!

01:00.461 --> 01:02.194
She cannot even act.

01:02.196 --> 01:02.761
Why are you doing this?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.234
You think you're
so talented, eh?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.235
That's what you think.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.404
All your movies are shit, okay?

01:14.457 --> 01:16.507
No one wants to work with
you except that stupid slut.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.411
Come here.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.248
See what you get?

01:22.249 --> 01:23.415
You're fucking
crazy, you know that?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.550
Yeah and you love it!

01:24.552 --> 01:25.451
Fucking crazy.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.395
Annalisa.

01:42.169 --> 01:42.868
Annalisa.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.645
Annalisa?

01:58.185 --> 02:00.686
Dear
Vincent, I'm sorry,

02:00.688 --> 02:02.554
but I cannot live
like this anymore.

02:03.524 --> 02:07.459
We are killing each other and
the beautiful love we share.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.031
We need some time apart.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.532
I'm flying back home to
stay with my Mom for now.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.167
I'll call you when I arrive.

02:16.437 --> 02:20.572
I'm sorry, but I didn't
know what else to do.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.707
Love, Annalisa.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.333
I wanted to make
a film about love.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.935
I wanted to make a film about...

04:32.539 --> 04:34.539
My vision for this film.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.078
Goddammit.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.846
I wanted to explore
a time in my life.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.018
I wanted to make
a film about love.

04:48.055 --> 04:51.623
I wanted to make a film about...

04:53.327 --> 04:54.593
I wanted to make a
film about the fucking

04:54.595 --> 04:56.061
garbage truck going away.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.528
That's what I wanted
to make a film about.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.564
What are you trying to do?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.468
I wanted to make a film that...

05:06.473 --> 05:07.539
Okay.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.841
I wanted to make a film.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.443
What did I want?

05:27.961 --> 05:30.696
I wanted to know if it was real.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.536
I wanted to know
if you were real.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.109
Oh God.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.880
Do not tell me I am still
in love with this woman, I--

05:54.355 --> 05:55.554
Nico.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.422
Are you ready?

05:57.424 --> 05:59.658
Uh, not really.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.561
You wear the suit
I bought you, right?

06:02.563 --> 06:03.729
No.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.164
Oh, come on, man.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.598
This is the biggest
cinema in Malta!

06:07.801 --> 06:09.901
Isn't it the only
cinema in Malta?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.770
Yes, but it's big.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.572
Oh, and we have
that meeting with

06:13.574 --> 06:14.906
those producers
later on as well.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.675
Yeah, I know.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.744
Hey, my
friend, be focused.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.546
This is the most important
day of your career, eh?

06:21.548 --> 06:22.547
Of our careers.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.584
Oh, Vincenzo!

06:25.586 --> 06:28.387
Look, I just don't know if I
can do this Q&A thing, man.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.621
Heh?

06:29.623 --> 06:30.956
Of course you can.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.625
Well, I mean, you have to.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.661
Just imagine that no
one else is in the room.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.463
Yeah, that's gotta work.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.565
You make the joke?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.601
Yes, Nico, that was a joke.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.969
Not funny.

06:43.971 --> 06:44.803
Look, I.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.905
Jesus Christ!

06:46.907 --> 06:48.673
Don't you ever knock?

06:48.675 --> 06:49.508
What for?

06:49.510 --> 06:50.709
I've got the key.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.612
Nico, I gotta go.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.546
Wear the suit!

06:56.884 --> 06:58.750
Look, I'm a little
busy here, Joe.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.854
Yeah, you know what,
just help yourself.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.490
Why you drink that wine?

07:06.593 --> 07:07.459
Why?

07:07.461 --> 07:08.627
Because I like it.

07:08.629 --> 07:12.197
I know plenty of
better wines than that.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.766
Well, it's what I used
to drink when I was here.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.967
How can you taste the future

07:15.969 --> 07:18.103
if you keep drinking the past?

07:22.876 --> 07:23.675
You have a date?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.477
A date?

07:25.479 --> 07:27.679
No, no, definitely not a date.

07:27.681 --> 07:31.149
Well, it should be, you
bloody never leave it here.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.585
Don't worry, I know some
girls for you, mate.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.220
Oh, I'm sure you do.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.622
Hey, some owe me favours.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.774
All right?

07:38.775 --> 07:39.925
I can ask if they're
transferable.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.594
You know what, I'm good.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.029
Thank you though.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.565
Ha, that's what you think!

07:48.602 --> 07:50.602
Look, is there something
I can help you with?

07:50.604 --> 07:53.538
Now that you mention it,
there is a little something.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.140
Look, no, serious.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.777
All right, my cousin
is getting married.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.246
Again, all right.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.482
The first one didn't work out.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.816
She wasn't nice to him.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.085
She couldn't even bloody cook.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.489
One time I went over for lunch,
it was a fucking disaster.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.658
I had to call the
ambulance, fire brigade,

08:13.660 --> 08:16.194
police department.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.729
It was a bloody
kershuffle, it was madness.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.932
Burnt the house
down with the food.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.534
Burnt it, gone.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.606
Anyway, I was thinking because
I think from time to time.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.207
I like to think in my life.

08:29.209 --> 08:33.645
Sometimes a man has to take
time and just think, okay?

08:33.647 --> 08:37.649
So this is what I was
thinking because I know you.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.952
And you make the video, okay.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.556
That, and they don't have
much money now because--

08:44.558 --> 08:48.593
Okay, look, the thing is, so,
Joe, I don't shoot weddings.

08:48.595 --> 08:49.939
I'm really sorry.

08:49.940 --> 08:51.284
You're gonna have
to find someone else

08:51.285 --> 08:52.629
for that one though,
pal, all right?

08:53.634 --> 08:54.833
You have the camera?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.538
Yes, Joe, I have a camera.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.306
Okay.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.073
Take it, point it,
press the button.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.946
Even a bloody donkey can do it.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.616
I'm trying to make
you a favour, mate.

09:11.618 --> 09:15.587
Get your name out there
in Malta, all right?

09:19.326 --> 09:21.593
If I say yes right
now will you leave?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.629
But for free you shoot it.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.032
I would love to
shoot it for free.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.000
Ah, that's it, mate.
Okay.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.285
That's a deal.
That's it, good stuff.

09:30.286 --> 09:31.569
That's the lock
in contract, mate.

09:31.572 --> 09:32.649
All right.

09:32.650 --> 09:33.727
- Well, talk to you later.
- That's it.

09:33.728 --> 09:34.805
Signed, sealed, and delivered!

09:34.808 --> 09:36.608
Done, talk to you later, buddy.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.678
Before I forget,
there's one more thing.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.314
The rent.

09:43.317 --> 09:44.450
What about the rent?

09:44.451 --> 09:45.584
I already paid you in full.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.587
I know you paid it.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.589
Now I need some more.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.596
Okay.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.229
Okay.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.064
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.983
I'll be back.

10:00.984 --> 10:02.901
I'll be back, I'll
collect it soon.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.111
Okay?

10:04.112 --> 10:05.320
Looking forward to
seeing you again.

10:05.321 --> 10:06.529
Okay, I'll pop in again, eh?

10:06.530 --> 10:07.738
'Cause I like to pop in.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.907
I don't like to
make appointments.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.125
That's what you do.

10:10.126 --> 10:11.342
I don't make appointments!

10:11.345 --> 10:12.177
- Live in the moment, buddy.
- Everything's a bloody

10:12.179 --> 10:13.979
appointment these days.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.715
Bloody mate, just come
over, talk like a human.

10:16.717 --> 10:21.119
Okay, bye.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.209
Vincent.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.213
Vincent!

10:52.419 --> 10:54.853
You started smoking again.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.389
What are you doing here?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.325
European premiere, right?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.260
I couldn't miss this.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.662
What, did you walk out?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.367
I just needed a minute.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.669
Nervous?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.774
I can't believe you're here.

11:16.410 --> 11:21.212
I'm here.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.714
Eh, Vincenzo!

11:24.851 --> 11:26.284
Who's that?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.287
I have to go.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.456
Can we grab a coffee
or something after?

11:33.326 --> 11:34.659
There's gonna be a Q&A.

11:34.660 --> 11:35.993
I don't really think
I'm gonna have time.

11:35.996 --> 11:36.895
Please.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.107
Just be cool, man.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.019
Cool.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.167
I loved it.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.418
I've only got like half an hour.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.086
We can go to our old bar.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.758
You lost weight.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.859
Stress.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.495
You haven't changed.

12:43.497 --> 12:47.365
Starting to get older,
wrinkles and everything.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.266
You look good.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.036
Wow, your first movie.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.072
I knew you would do it.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.507
Yeah, well.

12:55.509 --> 12:57.475
We'll see what the
audience has to say

12:57.477 --> 12:59.144
after the Q&A, right?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.111
Who cares what they say?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.146
You made your first movie.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.548
I'm very proud of you.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.382
Proud.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.450
Of course.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.486
How was the premiere
in New York?

13:09.322 --> 13:10.421
It was good.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.357
Mostly positive reviews.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.959
A few negatives ones.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.560
Try not to pay as much
attention to those.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.462
Any publicity's good publicity.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.331
I guess so.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.067
Story looked familiar.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.305
Yeah, well, write what you know.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.973
Isn't that what they taught us?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.109
And you know this story?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.177
This is, uh.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.278
Crazy, I know.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.181
What's it
been, like six years?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.081
Five.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.551
Five years, uh huh.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.055
Is that you, is that really you?

13:45.091 --> 13:46.608
I have so many questions.

13:46.609 --> 13:48.126
I don't even know if I
want the answers anymore.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.027
I do.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.129
Tell me everything.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.363
Are you married?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.832
Kids?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.200
Still in New York?

13:55.202 --> 13:56.334
How is your Dad?

13:56.335 --> 13:57.467
All right, just one at a time.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.504
Are you married?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.905
No.

14:00.907 --> 14:01.940
Kids?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.474
No, how about you?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.343
Sorry, excuse me.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.579
Excuse me.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.954
So anyone working
here today or what?

14:15.956 --> 14:16.988
We are in Europe.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.490
That's true, this would
not happen in the States.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.492
Relax, it's not
such a bad thing.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.532
I miss your Dad, you know.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.868
He's so funny, I
really love him.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.037
Yeah.

14:33.039 --> 14:33.938
What's wrong?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.243
He died.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.078
What?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.114
Oh my God.

14:44.150 --> 14:44.983
How?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.517
When?

14:46.519 --> 14:47.552
It was like over a year ago now.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.987
And you didn't tell me?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.355
What happened?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.923
It was pancreatic cancer.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.460
They found it by
accident, actually.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.494
It was...

14:56.496 --> 14:58.263
Not good.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.533
I'm sorry.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.402
The doctors, couldn't
they do anything?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.570
It was too aggressive.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.539
They caught it too late.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.507
You know, he hated going to
doctors and stuff like that.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.678
I'm so sorry.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.579
Oh my God.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.416
I think about him often.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.418
Yeah.
I really do.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.120
He was such a lovely man.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.256
I mean, he was a crazy
son of a bitch though.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.291
You know that.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.425
Vincent.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.459
It's true like...

15:28.461 --> 15:31.362
Why is it that when
somebody dies everybody

15:31.364 --> 15:32.430
makes them out to
be saints, you know?

15:32.432 --> 15:33.965
It's bullshit.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.667
Just because someone's
dead we can't

15:35.669 --> 15:39.170
remember them for who they
really were, good and bad?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.571
He was fucking crazy.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.674
You know, he had the
fuse of a matchstick.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.044
He also had a heart of gold.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.612
I love him, I mean,
he was my Dad.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.448
There was a lot of
tough love there,

15:50.450 --> 15:54.552
but he would do anything for
the people that he cared about.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.453
That's true.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.690
He definitely marched to
the beat of his own drum.

15:58.692 --> 16:01.492
Didn't care what anybody
else thought about him.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.694
Everyone has to
go, he used to say.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.362
Don't act like you won't.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.196
Good advice.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.097
Yeah.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.600
Yeah, didn't really sink
in until he died though.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.338
I think it actually gave me
the strength to make a movie.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.407
Really?

16:15.408 --> 16:17.475
Yeah, I was terrified for
a long time, you know.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.094
What if people
don't like my work?

16:19.095 --> 16:20.712
What if I'm not as good
as I thought I was?

16:20.714 --> 16:23.448
What if my ambition
far exceeds my talent?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.515
Just all that stuff.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.554
I think it takes
real loss to realise

16:29.556 --> 16:32.156
that you don't have
anything to lose, you know?

16:34.561 --> 16:35.626
You miss him.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.562
Yeah.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.584
So anyway.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.602
What are you doing with
yourself these days?

16:44.604 --> 16:45.536
I'm in fashion.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.272
Big surprise.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.173
Hey!

16:50.043 --> 16:51.192
I'm just saying.

16:51.193 --> 16:52.342
We couldn't go passed a
single shop in New York

16:52.345 --> 16:54.078
without you dragging
me in there.

16:54.714 --> 16:59.183
You know, there was one time
I edited an entire short film

16:59.185 --> 17:01.486
on my laptop while I
was waiting for you.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.320
Bullshit.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.204
It's true.

17:04.205 --> 17:06.089
It was the mise-en-scene,
the one-shot film.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.343
We used to watch them in class.

17:08.344 --> 17:10.595
It was like the openings of
Orson Welles, Touch of Evil.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.230
P.T. Anderson, Boogie Nights.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.965
You remember all that?

17:14.967 --> 17:17.701
If it was one-shot then
what was there to edit?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.438
The titles and stuff, I mean.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.472
I don't know, I'm just saying.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.473
You spent a lot
of times in shops.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.111
Come on.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.779
Carrying all that
equipment, camera lights.

17:27.781 --> 17:30.048
And all the editing, too crazy.

17:30.050 --> 17:30.681
I like fashion.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.582
It's easy for me.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.752
That's 'cause you're
doing what you love.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.354
You know, if you're
doing what you love,

17:36.356 --> 17:38.222
there's no other
way to live, right?

17:38.224 --> 17:40.525
So you still love filmmaking?

17:40.527 --> 17:41.626
Mm.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.544
I don't know.

17:42.545 --> 17:43.461
I'll tell you after the Q&A.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.663
Come on, stop stressing.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.434
I'm just saying, film
school was never for you.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.369
Every time I looked at
you, you were drawing shoes

17:51.371 --> 17:52.603
or something like that.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.706
Don't tell me your making shoes?

17:55.708 --> 17:56.674
Designing.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.076
Designing shoes.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.644
For like the biggest
Italian labels.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.745
Oh, no shit?

18:00.747 --> 18:01.646
I'm serious!

18:03.416 --> 18:04.438
Wow.

18:04.439 --> 18:05.461
All that time waiting
around actually

18:05.462 --> 18:06.484
amounted to something, huh?

18:06.486 --> 18:08.419
Hm, very funny.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.555
I might not be telling
stories like you,

18:10.557 --> 18:13.124
but when I see women wearing
shoes that I designed,

18:13.126 --> 18:15.093
and they look strong,
confident, and sexy,

18:15.095 --> 18:16.094
it makes me happy.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.630
Happy is good.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.299
Yeah, happy is good.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.636
You never told me if
you had a man or not.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.122
It's complicated.

18:28.123 --> 18:29.739
I don't really wanna
talk about it right now.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.381
I'm sorry, Vincent.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.718
For what?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.254
You know, for everything.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.389
That's a long time ago,
just forget about it.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.291
I just...

18:48.394 --> 18:49.227
I didn't know.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.698
Yep.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.768
Yeah, look, I'm just
around the corner.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.404
Okay.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.875
I gotta go.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.543
We just sat down.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.411
We didn't even have a drink.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.479
I came all this way.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.418
For what?

19:13.419 --> 19:14.452
I didn't ask you to come here.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.486
I still don't really know
what you're doing here.

19:17.457 --> 19:21.626
Look, um, it was nice
seeing you and everything.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.495
I'm glad you're
doing well, I just...

19:25.532 --> 19:26.664
Good luck, all right?

19:27.767 --> 19:28.666
I gotta go.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.203
Vincent!

19:32.205 --> 19:33.471
Vincent!

19:33.473 --> 19:34.472
What do you want?

19:34.474 --> 19:35.640
I just want to talk.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.842
Now you wanna talk?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.343
I told you I was sorry.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.913
'Cause that makes
everything all better.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.264
Vincent.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.614
Look, it has been five years.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.917
It's been five fucking years.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.818
I tried getting in touch
with you a bunch of times,

19:47.820 --> 19:48.995
but you never replied.

19:48.996 --> 19:50.171
You tried getting
in touch with me

19:50.172 --> 19:51.347
when things were on the
rocks with your boyfriend.

19:51.348 --> 19:52.523
You don't know what
you're talking about.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.558
You know what, I
don't care anymore.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.592
If you didn't care, we wouldn't

19:54.594 --> 19:56.444
be having this conversation.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.295
Well, we're not having the
fucking conversation, Annalisa.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.010
Love for Paradise.
For his debut movie.

How'd you know I'd be here?

22:19.505 --> 22:21.672
I micro-chipped you
when we were dating.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.642
Wouldn't surprise me.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.880
Can I have one?

22:29.882 --> 22:30.781
Yeah.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.585
What are you listening to?

22:34.587 --> 22:36.787
It's my buddy back in New York.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.556
We worked on a few
songs together.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.624
You make music now too?

Confused.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.871
We could've talked about it.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.707
I had to get away.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.642
Away from what, me?

23:31.644 --> 23:33.411
From everything.

23:34.981 --> 23:35.880
You left me.

23:37.984 --> 23:38.883
You left us.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.171
I know.

23:43.172 --> 23:43.788
Do you know how it made me feel

23:43.790 --> 23:45.790
when I came back and
you weren't there?

23:47.660 --> 23:49.059
You fucked it all up.

23:49.061 --> 23:49.960
Just me?

23:49.962 --> 23:52.797
Our relationship
didn't have problems?

23:53.833 --> 23:56.200
You wouldn't even do
anything with me anymore.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.768
Always working on your movies.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.537
Shooting, editing.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.038
Watching movies for research.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.840
Everything was research.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.910
I couldn't even say a word when
we watched a movie together.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.613
You loved your movies
more than you loved me.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.049
Is that what you think?

24:12.051 --> 24:13.984
We had problems, okay?

24:13.986 --> 24:15.486
Every relationship has problems.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.621
You don't just leave,
you work 'em out.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.491
Maybe I couldn't
work them out then.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.159
Maybe you just didn't want to.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.794
I'm here now.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.696
Yeah.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.999
Yeah, now you're here,
five years later.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.573
There would be times
that I'd be walking

24:35.575 --> 24:37.475
through the park
in East Village.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.477
Thompson Square Park.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.478
Tompkins.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.779
That's what I said.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.648
No, it's Tompkins, not Thompson.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.685
Thompson, Tompkins,
what's the difference?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.254
It's a different name.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.856
Oh God.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.824
Some things don't change, eh?

24:53.826 --> 24:56.594
You know I didn't grow up
speaking English like you.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.628
Okay.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.262
Sometimes I get it mixed up.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.597
What's the problem?

24:59.599 --> 25:01.098
I don't have a problem.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.668
One letter, Thompson, Tompkins.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.036
It's a completely
different name.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.205
Okay, you try and
speak Spanish, eh?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.357
Then we see.

25:09.358 --> 25:10.508
I correct you every
fucking second!

25:10.510 --> 25:12.643
And Annalisa's back.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.944
Thompson, Tompkins!

25:13.946 --> 25:16.080
Can I just finish
what I was saying?

25:16.082 --> 25:16.981
No!

25:17.884 --> 25:18.749
Go.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.136
Look.

25:22.137 --> 25:23.587
There was times that I'd be
walking back from the park.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.558
And I would just like freeze.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.378
You know, I literally
couldn't move.

25:30.379 --> 25:32.530
I would just see memories
of us everywhere.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.964
And it paralysed me.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.668
There was this one time I
was coming home from a shoot

25:38.738 --> 25:40.972
carrying all my
equipment and everything

25:40.973 --> 25:43.207
and this guy comes up to me
and I think he's gonna help me,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.175
but then he runs
off with my tripod.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.244
The tripod I bought for you.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.548
I'm trying to tell you how it

25:50.550 --> 25:52.816
made me feel when
you abandoned me,

25:52.818 --> 25:54.919
and all you can think
about is a stolen gift.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.020
So it was the one?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.472
Yeah.

25:58.473 --> 25:59.722
Do you know how much
I paid for that?

26:04.597 --> 26:07.064
Why didn't you return my calls?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.666
I know, I handled it all wrong.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.734
That's a fucking understatement.

26:10.736 --> 26:11.635
I'm sorry.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.808
Look, I have to go.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.578
For what?

26:20.580 --> 26:22.212
I have a dinner meeting.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.747
With who?

26:23.749 --> 26:25.182
What's it matter?

26:25.184 --> 26:26.717
I'm just curious.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.253
With a producer, all right?

26:29.254 --> 26:30.620
He set up a meeting
about a co-production.

26:30.623 --> 26:32.356
Another film in Malta.

26:32.358 --> 26:33.257
Maybe.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.660
How much time do you have?

26:38.664 --> 26:40.481
I don't know, like a few hours.

26:40.482 --> 26:42.299
Does it take you that
long to get ready?

26:42.301 --> 26:44.034
Look who's talking.

26:48.007 --> 26:48.856
Okay.

26:48.857 --> 26:49.706
Why, what'd you have in mind?

26:49.709 --> 26:51.642
Remember that
vacation we had here?

26:52.912 --> 26:54.078
Yes, I remember it.

26:54.079 --> 26:55.245
I just made a movie about it.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.114
Do you want to have
some fun or not?

27:01.654 --> 27:02.820
Oh yeah.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.005
Are you just saying that

27:04.006 --> 27:05.189
or do you really want
to have some fun?

27:05.191 --> 27:06.090
No, trust me, I really
wanna have some fun.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.071
It was there.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.340
The Azure Window
was right there.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.408
You're right.

30:11.410 --> 30:12.843
You wouldn't even know now.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.979
It's sad.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.381
The Maltese people
lost something

30:17.383 --> 30:19.016
that was truly a part of them.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.634
And now it's what?

30:20.635 --> 30:22.251
It's just a bunch of rocks
at the bottom of the sea.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.855
I think it depends how you
look at it, like everything.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.257
The fact is it went back
to where it came from.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.393
What?

30:29.395 --> 30:32.095
Millions of years ago,
that formation was made

30:32.097 --> 30:34.431
through giant seas
and everything.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.467
Now its collapsed by the
same nature that created it.

30:37.469 --> 30:41.205
You say things are ours,
but what is really ours?

30:41.207 --> 30:42.472
What do we really own?

30:42.474 --> 30:45.275
Our thoughts and experiences.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.377
That's it.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.546
Anything can be taken
from us at any time.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.449
The sooner we accept that,
the sooner we can cope

30:52.451 --> 30:55.118
with whatever life throws at us.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.236
What does that mean though?

30:56.237 --> 30:57.353
You live your life
detached from everything

30:57.356 --> 30:58.856
for fear of
eventually losing it?

30:58.858 --> 31:00.357
I mean, what's the
point of getting close

31:00.359 --> 31:02.359
to anything or anyone
for that matter?

31:02.361 --> 31:04.261
No, it's the opposite.

31:04.263 --> 31:07.497
You can't live your life in
fear of disappointment and loss.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.167
But that's the thing, we
never really lose anything.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.170
We have to nurture and
care for people and things

31:13.172 --> 31:15.072
we have when we have them.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.573
But we have to be
okay with accepting

31:16.575 --> 31:18.408
when these things
are taken from us.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.445
That's life, we can't stop it.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.614
But we can control
our reactions.

31:25.284 --> 31:26.516
Like this Azure Window.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.585
It was amazing, a wonder,

31:29.889 --> 31:33.323
but it was formed by nature,
or whatever you believe.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.524
And taken back by the same.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.494
We have to be okay with that.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.430
Be thankful for what we
have when we have it.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.499
Concern ourselves with
what we can control

31:42.501 --> 31:43.634
not things we can't.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.169
Be okay with letting go.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.474
Just like you let go of me?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.220
Such a drama queen!

32:03.222 --> 32:06.623
When I moved back to Europe,
I felt a lot more comfortable.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.458
- Mm.
- Just culturally, you know.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.293
Oh, careful.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.560
- Fuck!
- You okay?

32:10.562 --> 32:12.195
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

32:12.197 --> 32:13.430
Sorry, sorry, I'm fine.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.399
I was just saying the
cultural differences.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.500
- Yeah.
- Like everyone runs

32:16.502 --> 32:17.935
on expensive cigarettes here.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.320
I'm good with that.

32:19.321 --> 32:20.704
In New York, no one smokes.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.506
They are gym crazy,
health crazy.

32:22.508 --> 32:23.674
Vitamins for everything.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.542
Stuff for this,
something for that.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.945
They're obsessed about
health and calories,

32:27.947 --> 32:29.079
but they seem more unhealthy

32:29.081 --> 32:31.014
in their own way than Europeans.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.316
You sit there with
a plate of paella

32:32.318 --> 32:34.117
and they look at you funny.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.320
You used to cook paella
very day for us in New York.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.387
What the hell are
you talking about?

32:37.389 --> 32:38.422
I will always eat paella, okay?

32:38.424 --> 32:40.023
I'm Spanish.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.359
I'm just saying it's
weird for Americans.

32:42.361 --> 32:45.062
Here in Europe, there is not
this big thing about health.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.330
It's like cigarettes
don't give you cancer

32:46.332 --> 32:47.397
over here or something.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.066
No, no, no.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.601
Cigarettes are giving everyone
cancer everywhere, trust me.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.603
That's why you
started smoking again?

32:55.240 --> 32:56.440
I fell off the wagon
for a little bit.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.274
I'll get back on.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.542
You mean on the wagon.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.610
No, it's off the wagon.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.612
No, the wagon is bad.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.281
No, wagon is good.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.750
But on the wagon
is like the trap.

33:06.752 --> 33:07.651
You fall in the trap.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.687
No, the trap is off not on.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.255
That doesn't make sense.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.491
Is it a little strange.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.727
I think they should change it.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.428
Would you like to
be the ambassador

33:18.430 --> 33:20.397
for the international
change on the wagon?

33:20.399 --> 33:21.565
Off the wagon.

33:21.567 --> 33:22.599
Ah, there you go.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.475
Nico.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.144
Okay.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.248
Look, I'll be there, okay?

33:39.551 --> 33:40.450
I'll be there.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.453
Yeah, okay.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.622
Bye.

33:47.092 --> 33:47.791
We have to go?

33:49.728 --> 33:50.627
Soon.

33:50.629 --> 33:54.331
I'm just saying it's
normal to smoke here.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.432
Whenever I smoked in New York,

33:55.434 --> 33:57.134
I felt people were
watching me saying

33:57.136 --> 33:58.535
look at Eurotrash smoking.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.471
Eurotrash.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.506
Isn't that what you guys say?

34:02.508 --> 34:03.640
Oh, us guys.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.409
Yeah, Americans.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.612
Okay, now you're generalising,
bordering on prejudice.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.581
What, I'm not allowed
to express my own views?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.485
You know, sometimes I think
you get too sensitive.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.319
Oh, is that right?

34:16.321 --> 34:17.871
Yeah.

34:17.871 --> 34:19.422
What's the problem with my
experience living in America

34:19.425 --> 34:21.757
I've encountered people
who talk this way?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.793
I was just saying if
you think that everybody

34:23.795 --> 34:26.496
talks that way, that
would be prejudice.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.348
No.

34:28.349 --> 34:30.199
Actually prejudice is
a preconceived opinion

34:30.202 --> 34:33.536
that is not based on reason
or actual experience.

34:33.539 --> 34:34.438
Wow, wow.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.539
Did you memorise that?

34:35.541 --> 34:37.507
Yeah, I was curious.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.310
Hmm, curious about
being prejudice?

34:40.312 --> 34:41.545
How can we not be comfortable

34:41.547 --> 34:44.347
in forming views
based on experience?

34:44.349 --> 34:45.748
We must be able to
express ourselves

34:45.751 --> 34:47.734
and live in a free world.

34:47.735 --> 34:49.717
I agree, I'm just saying
it's very dangerous territory

34:49.721 --> 34:52.089
you're getting into.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.458
Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.561
So what if, for example,
I live next to the sea.

34:57.563 --> 34:58.879
Mm-hmm.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.196
And in my life I know people

35:00.199 --> 35:03.600
who have been eaten by sharks,
the same brand of sharks.

35:04.670 --> 35:05.702
The same brand?

35:05.704 --> 35:07.471
Yeah, the particular shark.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.173
Species maybe.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.275
Ugh, species, brand, come on!

35:12.277 --> 35:15.712
So I say that these
sharks are killers.

35:15.714 --> 35:19.149
Is this prejudice to all the
others sharks in the sea?

35:20.385 --> 35:23.787
You could say that this
particular species of shark

35:23.789 --> 35:27.224
have killed humans under
certain conditions.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.692
Oh my god!

35:28.694 --> 35:29.726
Serious?

35:29.728 --> 35:32.129
Come on, this is ridiculous!

35:32.898 --> 35:36.800
We have to be open
and comfortable to

35:36.802 --> 35:39.369
I'm not saying that
generalising and forming views

35:39.371 --> 35:42.706
without reason, but there has
to be some level of openness.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.575
Freedom of speech
and all that stuff.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.477
Everything people
before us fought for

35:47.479 --> 35:50.347
is slowly getting buried
by sensitive politicians

35:50.349 --> 35:52.249
who don't want to
get on the wrong side

35:52.251 --> 35:54.851
of a particular group for
fear of being prejudice.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.522
You know, there's this great
philosopher named Epictetus.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.374
I really love reading him.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.225
He talks about calling
things by their right name.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.627
I really like his take on it.

36:03.629 --> 36:04.528
Right name?

36:04.530 --> 36:06.063
Yeah.

36:06.064 --> 36:07.597
So calling things
for what they are

36:07.599 --> 36:09.733
without adding your
own judgement to them.

36:09.735 --> 36:13.737
For example, if you see a
guy who drinks a lotta beer

36:13.739 --> 36:16.089
you wouldn't call
him an alcoholic.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.440
You'd just say he's a guy who
drinks a lot of beer, right?

36:18.443 --> 36:21.545
So unless you have a comprehensive
understanding of his life,

36:21.547 --> 36:23.413
how do you know if
he's an alcoholic?

36:23.415 --> 36:26.550
It's about not getting misguided
by the appearance of things

36:26.552 --> 36:30.520
and creating this
distorted view, right?

36:30.522 --> 36:33.456
You stick to the facts,
you use the right name.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.493
Jesus.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.595
These rocks are slippery.

36:38.597 --> 36:39.429
Oh, sorry, sorry.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.630
Not all of them.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.898
Ah ha.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.567
Ah ha, very good.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.436
You know, I didn't even
ask about your Mom.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.737
How is she?

36:47.739 --> 36:49.706
You know, she used to
ask about you everyday.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.509
Yeah, she's the best.

36:52.511 --> 36:53.944
- And her cooking, man.
- Amazing.

36:53.946 --> 36:54.844
My God.

36:56.215 --> 36:57.714
She used to ask about
me, what does that mean?

36:57.716 --> 36:58.615
She forgot?

36:59.551 --> 37:01.585
Not by choice.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.686
Alzheimer's.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.522
What?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.524
I thought you had to be
really old to get that.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.826
Earlier onset is
what they call it.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.562
It's pretty common actually.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.297
How bad is she?

37:14.299 --> 37:16.516
Bad.

37:16.517 --> 37:18.734
Especially this last year,
I had to put her in a home.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.803
Shit.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.439
Your Mom was always
like Wonder Woman,

37:22.441 --> 37:23.673
doing a million things at once.

37:23.675 --> 37:24.941
There's no stoppin' her.

37:25.944 --> 37:26.843
That's so sad.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.646
You know, sometimes
I feel like I'm lucky

37:29.648 --> 37:31.648
to have this last
bit of time with her.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.883
Like it's a warning
or something.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.619
I'm getting the chance to
know that she won't be here

37:35.621 --> 37:37.154
much longer and I
can make the most

37:37.155 --> 37:38.688
of the time we
have left together.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.858
But it's such an awful disease.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.460
She's not even her anymore.

37:44.396 --> 37:47.497
I visit all the time and
when I leave I feel so sad.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.332
Unbalanced.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.768
It really weighs on me
to see her like this.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.640
I don't want to be left with
these last memories of her.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.708
Does she still remember you?

37:58.710 --> 37:59.609
I think so.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.512
Maybe, I can't
tell you for sure,

38:02.514 --> 38:04.381
but she does feel
comfortable when I'm around

38:04.383 --> 38:05.015
so that's good.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.900
Yeah.

38:06.901 --> 38:08.784
So how is it, she just
forgets a lot of things.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.238
No, that's what I thought

38:11.239 --> 38:12.722
that she would just
keep forgetting things,

38:12.724 --> 38:15.358
but it got worse and worse.

38:16.061 --> 38:19.562
It's a neurological disorder
so it kills your brain cells.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.665
So, yes, it's starting
with her forgetting things,

38:21.667 --> 38:23.566
- but everyone forgets things.
- Yeah.

38:23.568 --> 38:25.335
So we never really
put it down to more

38:25.337 --> 38:28.438
than just her doing too
many things and forgetting.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.640
But then it got worse and worse.

38:31.543 --> 38:36.446
Like she would drive and
forget where she was.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.748
Forget how to get home.

38:41.386 --> 38:44.654
This last time she
called me and was stuck

38:44.656 --> 38:48.591
in the middle of the road
in rush hour, freaking out.

38:48.593 --> 38:49.893
She didn't even know
how she got there.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.695
Oh shit.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.430
I was worried about
her for months.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.798
She was crying so much.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.767
I took her to see a
professor in Barcelona

38:57.769 --> 39:00.537
and they did a bunch
of tests and stuff.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.339
They diagnosed her
soon after that.

39:03.508 --> 39:06.476
So it's not like with
The Notebook then.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.712
Flashbacks of memories.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.847
It's no love story, trust me.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.582
It's sad.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.984
I'm literally watching
her age backwards.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.587
When you're born,
you know nothing.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.490
And they even have
to hold your head up.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.624
But you learn, adapt.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.594
Everything you
could do right now,

39:24.596 --> 39:26.696
at one point you
couldn't do that, right?

39:27.599 --> 39:30.567
You develop skills
to communicate and

39:30.569 --> 39:31.601
and find yourself.

39:31.603 --> 39:37.507
She's literally going
backwards, losing her identity.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.542
She's growing up
to be an infant.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.711
It's sad, it's so sad.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.580
She's in her own world.

39:43.582 --> 39:48.485
Mumbles all day with memories
in her scattered mind.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.853
No comprehension of the world.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.624
I'm really sorry, Annalisa.

39:54.626 --> 39:55.725
It's life, right?

39:55.727 --> 39:57.694
It's life and it's real.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.630
I just have to accept it.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.031
And I accept it.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.534
Like I was saying
before, she's going back

40:04.536 --> 40:06.603
from where she came
and that's life.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.040
I just don't want her
to lose her dignity.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.443
She always looked
after herself so much.

40:13.445 --> 40:14.544
Took pride in herself.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.647
Always so stylish,
dressed so well.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.718
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.019
You remember what
my Dad said about

40:23.021 --> 40:24.554
no one getting out alive?

40:28.493 --> 40:29.659
It's true.

40:29.661 --> 40:30.560
I mean...

40:31.830 --> 40:34.497
I think everyone
wastes a lot of time.

40:34.499 --> 40:36.166
Everyone takes time for granted.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.669
We can spend days,
weeks, months...

40:39.671 --> 40:41.104
People spend a lifetime
getting caught up

40:41.106 --> 40:42.872
in things that are
so meaningless.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.576
I mean, old grudges against
family and loved one.

40:46.578 --> 40:50.713
But that's the thing, those
bonds, those relationships,

40:52.551 --> 40:53.650
they're special.

40:54.820 --> 40:55.819
And they're finite.

40:58.457 --> 41:01.624
Just knowing that we're
only going to be able

41:01.626 --> 41:03.092
to really connect
with just a few people

41:03.094 --> 41:04.894
throughout the
course of our lives.

41:06.665 --> 41:10.500
You know, we really
just have to cherish

41:10.502 --> 41:12.535
and hold on, protect, that love.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.539
Against anything the
world can throw at us.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.076
Life's too short.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.657
Why'd you do that?

41:34.659 --> 41:35.758
Do you want me to stop?

41:38.530 --> 41:40.830
This is gonna complicate things.

41:40.832 --> 41:41.731
Definitely.

It freaks me out,
but I can't help it.

44:43.748 --> 44:45.782
We're all going to
die anyway, right?

44:46.451 --> 44:47.817
Just like you're Dad said.

44:47.819 --> 44:49.318
When you're dead, you are dead.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.320
You're not going to know,
you're not going to care.

44:51.322 --> 44:52.689
You are dead.

44:55.226 --> 44:56.426
I guess.

44:56.428 --> 45:00.196
Don't fear death, fear
the fear of death.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.698
Just like you're fearing now.

45:04.551 --> 45:06.134
You know, for someone who
didn't grow up speaking English

45:06.137 --> 45:08.037
you really have
a way with words.

45:08.039 --> 45:09.072
I taught myself.

45:09.074 --> 45:09.906
Really?

45:09.908 --> 45:11.157
Yeah.

45:11.158 --> 45:12.407
We have English in school,
but it was just basic.

45:12.410 --> 45:14.410
The teacher was hopeless.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.079
When I decided I was
going to New York,

45:16.081 --> 45:19.348
I just went crazy learning
everything I could.

45:19.350 --> 45:21.584
- Yeah.
- I'd carry a notebook

45:21.585 --> 45:23.819
everywhere, listening to English
lessons on my headphones.

45:24.456 --> 45:26.823
My friends who stayed in
Barcelona thought I was nuts,

45:26.825 --> 45:30.259
but they were happy staying
there so they didn't care.

45:30.261 --> 45:32.395
I just knew I wanted to get out.

45:32.397 --> 45:33.896
See what's on the other side.

45:35.066 --> 45:37.333
Where better than the
city that never sleeps?

45:37.335 --> 45:39.368
So basically you just
watched way too much

45:39.370 --> 45:41.871
Sex and the City and you
decided to see it for yourself.

45:41.873 --> 45:42.805
Pretty much.

45:42.807 --> 45:44.240
Okay.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.476
I thought my English
was actually pretty good

45:46.478 --> 45:47.944
till I got too New York.

45:47.946 --> 45:49.846
Oh my God, I was so embarrassed.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.380
I didn't understand anything!

45:51.382 --> 45:53.116
I always knew what
you were saying.

45:53.118 --> 45:55.017
But I didn't understand
what you were saying.

45:55.019 --> 45:56.419
That's not true.

45:56.421 --> 45:58.020
Okay, maybe half of the time.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.490
So what, so the other
half of the time

46:00.492 --> 46:02.358
you just pretended to
know what I was saying?

46:02.360 --> 46:03.192
Not bad, huh?

46:03.194 --> 46:04.360
Are you serious?
Yeah.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.830
That's unbelievable.

46:11.536 --> 46:12.468
That death thing, man.

46:12.470 --> 46:14.370
Ugh, again.

46:14.372 --> 46:15.972
All right, here me out, look.

46:17.142 --> 46:21.444
Every day is one day
closer to the day.

46:21.446 --> 46:25.782
From the moment we're born,
we're put on the path to death.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.218
My Dad had the best
attitude about all of this,

46:29.220 --> 46:31.521
but it just scares
the shit out of me.

46:31.523 --> 46:32.889
And I try not to think about it.

46:32.891 --> 46:35.458
I tell myself not
to think about it,

46:35.460 --> 46:36.859
but I still think about it.

46:38.396 --> 46:40.563
There are so many things that
I'm never gonna be able to do

46:40.565 --> 46:42.532
because I'm already too old.

46:42.534 --> 46:44.267
I think we can do
anything at any age.

46:44.269 --> 46:46.836
That's not true.

46:46.837 --> 46:49.404
Okay, what is it that you
will never be able to do?

46:50.441 --> 46:52.175
Become a world-class gymnast.

46:52.177 --> 46:53.075
Gymnast?

46:53.077 --> 46:54.277
Yes.

46:54.279 --> 46:55.578
I didn't even know
you liked that.

46:55.580 --> 46:58.080
I don't like it, but
that's not the point.

46:58.082 --> 46:59.449
It is exactly--

46:59.450 --> 47:00.817
I couldn't do it even
if I wanted to do it.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.185
It's exactly the point.

47:02.187 --> 47:05.488
What in your life right
now do you want to do?

47:05.490 --> 47:06.923
What do you want to be?

47:06.925 --> 47:08.024
A filmmaker.

47:08.026 --> 47:09.258
What are you doing?

47:09.260 --> 47:11.127
Making films.

47:11.128 --> 47:12.995
Okay, so don't worry
about being a gymnast.

47:12.997 --> 47:15.598
Concentrate in putting
all your time and energy

47:15.600 --> 47:18.601
on films into being the best
you can be at what you love.

47:18.603 --> 47:19.836
- No.
- Don't worry about

47:19.838 --> 47:21.070
being too old to
become a gymnast.

47:21.072 --> 47:22.839
I was just saying
gymnast though.

47:22.841 --> 47:24.841
It could have been anything.

47:24.843 --> 47:27.043
Vincent, I know you.

47:27.045 --> 47:29.045
If you really wanted
to be a gymnast,

47:29.047 --> 47:32.081
a race car driver,
whatever, you would be.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.316
I really know you.

47:33.318 --> 47:36.385
When you love something,
you become obsessed.

47:36.387 --> 47:39.188
Nothing else matters,
just like making films.

47:40.024 --> 47:41.257
Nothing will stop you.

47:41.259 --> 47:43.259
No one will stop you.

47:43.261 --> 47:44.427
Be happy knowing that.

47:45.496 --> 47:46.562
I guess.

47:48.433 --> 47:49.966
But I still think
about death though.

47:49.968 --> 47:51.418
Oh my God.

47:51.419 --> 47:52.869
You know, with all this
thinking and talking

47:52.871 --> 47:55.204
you're probably going
to attract it even more.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.439
What, like law of attraction?

47:56.441 --> 47:57.406
Yeah, you don't
believe it's true?

47:57.408 --> 47:58.507
No, no, no, I do.

47:58.509 --> 47:59.876
I believe it's true.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.944
We definitely become
what we think,

48:01.946 --> 48:03.279
what's on our mind.

48:03.281 --> 48:05.448
As a matter of fact, I take
relief in that, you know

48:05.450 --> 48:09.352
I take relief in knowing that
I can shape my own future.

48:09.354 --> 48:11.220
I have so many friends,
they have different beliefs

48:11.222 --> 48:12.622
about this kind of thing and...

48:13.892 --> 48:15.558
The thing is, none of
it is tangible enough

48:15.560 --> 48:17.393
to set your life to.

48:17.395 --> 48:20.263
Law of attraction, I know it
works because I tested it.

48:20.265 --> 48:22.531
I do it, I do it
every single day.

48:22.533 --> 48:27.503
I am always visualising the
way I want my life to be.

48:27.505 --> 48:29.538
You know what, take this
film for example, all right.

48:29.540 --> 48:30.907
My first feature film.

48:30.909 --> 48:32.208
That's my dream.

48:32.210 --> 48:34.243
And I'd already directed
it a thousand times

48:34.245 --> 48:35.978
before I got on set.

48:35.980 --> 48:37.546
And now that I've
created this life

48:37.548 --> 48:40.016
I can't wait to do
it all over again.

48:40.018 --> 48:41.050
That's great.

48:41.052 --> 48:42.618
Yeah, and it's not even.

48:42.620 --> 48:44.654
It works for little things too.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.689
I started to figure this out
when I was just a little kid.

48:46.691 --> 48:48.491
Little Vincent, oh, cute.

48:48.493 --> 48:50.226
It is cute, yeah.

48:50.228 --> 48:52.629
No, listen, listen.

48:52.630 --> 48:55.031
My Dad set up this basketball
ring for me in the driveway

48:55.033 --> 48:58.067
and a lot of the times
when I was playing

48:58.069 --> 48:59.368
the ball would
bounce over the fence

48:59.370 --> 49:01.037
into the neighbor's yard,

49:01.039 --> 49:03.039
but my neighbour had
this real scary dog.

49:03.041 --> 49:05.141
So anytime the ball bounced over

49:05.143 --> 49:07.576
I would have to wait for
the neighbour to get home

49:07.578 --> 49:10.346
and then toss the ball
back over, but, of course,

49:10.348 --> 49:11.681
by then it's too late to play.

49:11.683 --> 49:15.384
So I came up with
a little something.

49:15.386 --> 49:18.988
I did this thing where every
time it looked like the ball

49:18.990 --> 49:21.657
was about to bounce
over, I just like,

49:21.659 --> 49:24.527
I concentrated and
I imagined that ball

49:24.529 --> 49:27.730
hitting the fence and
coming back towards me.

49:27.732 --> 49:30.399
And I'm telling
you that it worked.

49:30.401 --> 49:31.684
I swear to God it worked.

49:31.685 --> 49:32.968
Now I didn't tell
anybody about this.

49:32.971 --> 49:36.038
It was highly confidential,
it was my secret.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.040
'Cause people would
probably think I was crazy,

49:38.042 --> 49:40.743
but I knew it worked
so it didn't matter.

49:40.745 --> 49:43.145
You stopped the ball from going

49:43.147 --> 49:44.547
over the fence with your mind?

49:44.549 --> 49:45.448
Yes.

49:46.651 --> 49:47.984
Most of the time.

49:47.986 --> 49:49.418
Sometime the shot
was so horrible

49:49.420 --> 49:51.687
that no law of anything
would have saved it.

49:51.689 --> 49:55.624
Can you do anything else--

49:55.626 --> 49:56.726
Hi, Nico.

49:58.563 --> 49:59.729
Look, why don't you just
tell me where you'll be

49:59.731 --> 50:01.731
and I'll meet you guys there?

50:01.733 --> 50:03.432
All right.

50:03.434 --> 50:04.600
Yeah, bye.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.371
You have to go?

50:08.373 --> 50:09.739
I've got a little more time.

50:11.476 --> 50:12.508
So any other tricks?

50:16.481 --> 50:19.281
I can have you naked
without even touching you.

50:19.283 --> 50:20.716
- Oh really.
- Yeah.

50:20.718 --> 50:21.617
Do it.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.453
You sure?

50:24.455 --> 50:26.389
I dare you.

50:30.528 --> 50:31.427
Okay.

50:33.564 --> 50:35.264
You asked for it though.

50:46.677 --> 50:49.678
That's even better

52:32.283 --> 52:34.483
No, you were good,
but now you are.

52:36.521 --> 52:37.586
Very good?

52:40.424 --> 52:42.191
I was going to say amazing.

52:44.462 --> 52:45.628
Still have yours?

52:47.331 --> 52:49.465
Yeah, it's my battle scar.

52:49.467 --> 52:52.434
Battle scar, that's
how you think of us?

52:52.436 --> 52:53.602
Parts of us.

52:54.939 --> 52:55.838
Maybe.

53:00.511 --> 53:03.412
How many times have we listened
to that song in New York?

53:03.414 --> 53:05.581
I think we wore out the mp3.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.418
We were in a rush
to get to class.

53:09.420 --> 53:11.353
Who's fault was that?

53:11.355 --> 53:13.756
What, it stimulates creativity.

53:13.758 --> 53:15.257
I was trying to help you.

53:15.259 --> 53:16.625
I didn't hear you complaining.

53:20.298 --> 53:23.832
You used to step out of
that shower every morning

53:23.834 --> 53:25.801
dripping wet.

53:26.671 --> 53:29.805
Your curves backlit by
the smoggy morning glow

53:29.807 --> 53:31.774
of the New York city skyline.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.542
Such an imagination.

53:34.712 --> 53:35.945
And you'd be singing.

53:38.349 --> 53:41.917
Something always
brings me back to you.

53:45.856 --> 53:47.489
Were we crazy or what?

53:47.491 --> 53:50.326
That's like the golden
rule of tattoos,

53:50.328 --> 53:51.794
is not get your partner's name.

53:51.796 --> 53:52.761
It's not a name.

53:54.932 --> 53:55.831
It's true.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.501
It was our bond, our moment.

54:00.605 --> 54:01.503
Our time.

54:04.508 --> 54:05.441
What about now?

54:07.912 --> 54:08.811
Now.

54:16.954 --> 54:18.554
Now it's our time again.

54:21.792 --> 54:24.526
I never wanted anybody
else, you know.

54:25.363 --> 54:26.528
After that performance,
I think you've

54:26.530 --> 54:27.763
had a lot of practise.

54:29.333 --> 54:30.032
So what?

54:31.702 --> 54:34.603
I've never been connected to
anyone like I am with you.

54:36.540 --> 54:37.873
I was sleeping with other girls,

54:37.875 --> 54:39.808
but I'd be thinking about you.

54:39.810 --> 54:41.677
That's a little weird.

54:41.679 --> 54:42.578
I...

54:44.315 --> 54:45.347
Even your smell,

54:45.349 --> 54:46.448
- it's hard to explain.
- I smell?

54:46.450 --> 54:48.350
It's a good smell.

54:48.352 --> 54:50.719
It's pheromones, it's science.

54:50.721 --> 54:53.522
Body odours are connected
with sexual attraction.

54:55.793 --> 54:58.027
And I just never had
that with anyone else.

54:59.864 --> 55:02.798
It's like, just to
hold you and breathe

55:02.800 --> 55:07.303
makes me feel home and away
all in the same breath.

55:09.073 --> 55:11.340
Like there's no where
else I'd rather be

55:12.043 --> 55:15.577
in this world than right
there with you in that moment.

55:15.579 --> 55:16.478
That's sweet.

55:24.088 --> 55:25.854
I'm not letting you go again.

55:27.024 --> 55:30.492
I don't care what we have
to do to make it work.

55:30.494 --> 55:31.593
We'll do it.

55:33.597 --> 55:35.631
This, this right
here, this is special.

55:37.368 --> 55:39.668
This is a gift, this
is our second chance,

55:41.539 --> 55:42.805
and if you don't see that--

55:42.807 --> 55:43.706
I do.

55:44.775 --> 55:46.008
I do, Vincent.

55:57.588 --> 55:58.687
I love you.

56:23.614 --> 56:25.047
Did you
find something?

56:28.552 --> 56:30.386
I didn't know you
still had this.

56:31.389 --> 56:32.654
Going through my stuff?

56:32.656 --> 56:33.856
It was just sitting here.

56:34.825 --> 56:36.392
You still carry it.

56:36.394 --> 56:37.426
I still use it.

56:38.496 --> 56:41.130
You filled it five years ago.

56:41.132 --> 56:42.498
I find room.

56:44.402 --> 56:45.434
I couldn't help notice.

56:45.436 --> 56:48.570
That note I wrote for you.

56:48.572 --> 56:50.539
You wrote a lot of stuff.

56:51.575 --> 56:54.977
Passing notes in class
and stuff, it was cute.

56:54.979 --> 56:56.645
Remember we tried to
hide it from them?

56:56.647 --> 56:58.647
Like that was never
going to work.

56:58.649 --> 57:01.617
We couldn't keep our
eyes off each other.

57:01.619 --> 57:02.718
I know.

57:04.455 --> 57:06.555
Remember that
first day in class?

57:06.557 --> 57:09.091
We all had to get up,
introduce ourselves.

57:09.093 --> 57:12.127
My God, I was so nervous.

57:12.129 --> 57:14.096
Especially about my English.

57:14.098 --> 57:17.099
You were at the back of the room

57:17.101 --> 57:19.568
with all of the other Europeans.

57:19.570 --> 57:24.640
And I heard this voice,
this sexy, exotic voice

57:26.510 --> 57:30.112
and turned around, and that
was the first time I saw you.

57:32.883 --> 57:33.982
First time?

57:35.786 --> 57:38.520
I noticed you from the moment
you walked in the school.

57:38.522 --> 57:39.755
How come you didn't notice me?

57:39.757 --> 57:42.057
I was focused, okay.

57:42.059 --> 57:43.659
I was a man on a mission.

57:43.661 --> 57:44.626
For what?

57:44.628 --> 57:46.061
To make movies.

57:46.931 --> 57:49.798
I didn't know I was about
to be struck by lightning.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.166
I was lightning?

57:51.168 --> 57:52.501
And thunder.

57:52.503 --> 57:53.202
Wow.

57:55.105 --> 58:00.008
You stood up and you said,
I'm Annalisa from Barcelona.

58:01.645 --> 58:02.644
I was done.

58:03.714 --> 58:05.831
I don't know what
you said after that

58:05.832 --> 58:07.949
because the whole room,
I couldn't hear anything.

58:07.952 --> 58:13.021
It was like in Raging
Bull when Jake LaMotta's

58:13.023 --> 58:15.491
about to get drilled
by Sugar Ray Robinson.

58:15.493 --> 58:16.825
Just silence.

58:18.629 --> 58:20.062
The calm before the storm.

58:21.665 --> 58:22.831
It was a storm.

58:23.767 --> 58:24.800
It still is.

58:30.508 --> 58:32.040
Are you sure you
don't wanna come?

58:32.042 --> 58:33.809
They want to see you and not me.

58:34.745 --> 58:35.644
Are you sure?

58:39.850 --> 58:41.617
Go.

58:41.619 --> 58:42.718
Okay.

58:42.720 --> 58:43.619
Okay.

58:46.690 --> 58:47.990
I miss you already.

58:58.168 --> 58:59.601
Hey.

59:36.774 --> 59:38.040
Where'd you go?

59:38.042 --> 59:39.675
To buy cigarettes.

59:39.677 --> 59:42.244
What happened to your meeting?

59:43.814 --> 59:44.980
Your meeting?

59:46.317 --> 59:48.584
I met with them, I just.

59:50.154 --> 59:53.322
I figured they could sort
out the rest of the details.

59:53.324 --> 59:55.223
I want to be with you.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:06.962
Come back to bed.

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:12.868
I need to talk to you.

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.037
We can talk about
it in the morning.

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:16.872
Just come back to bed.

01:01:16.874 --> 01:01:18.674
I really need to talk to you.

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:25.781
Now?

01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:30.986
Okay.

01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:38.994
I don't know how to say this so.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.398
Um.

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:45.400
Look, it's okay.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.402
I already know.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:49.938
Know what?

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:54.409
I know what happened.

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:58.447
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:01:58.449 --> 01:01:59.481
We're together again now.

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:01.483
We'll have another one.

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:04.052
What?

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.221
Well, we talked about
what we would do

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:09.024
if this situation happened,
but we were younger then.

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:10.726
I mean, it's different now.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:13.462
You know, I'm making money.

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:16.298
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.333
Hey, it's okay.

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:20.335
You don't know what
you're talking about?

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.505
I found it when I moved out.

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:24.806
Found what?

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:28.376
The pregnancy test.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:29.511
The pregnancy test.

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.012
Oh my God.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.349
It's okay.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:35.751
No, it's not.

01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:38.386
Okay.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:39.821
Come here, just talk to me.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.359
All we did was fight.

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:46.428
We had so many problems.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.396
You were always busy.

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:50.132
What are you talking about?

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.369
I didn't know who
the father was.

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:56.938
I was confused.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.773
I couldn't tell you.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:58.540
What if it wasn't yours?

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.212
You fucking cheated on me?

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:09.251
Who is he?

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:10.085
Vincent.

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:11.086
Who is he?

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.823
My husband, my now husband.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.897
This gets better.

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:22.798
Vincent.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:28.270
Vincent.

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.239
Where's he from?

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.110
Barcelona, I knew him already.

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:36.545
He was on vacation in New York.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.415
And what the fuck
was today about then?

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:46.121
This wasn't easy, okay?

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:47.322
To come and see you.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.158
I told myself that
I would come clean,

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.861
tell you everything
face to face.

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:54.996
But it was just like
all those years ago.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:57.599
I was about to
write you a letter.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:00.869
And you don't deserve it.

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:03.104
I was with you lying
in bed and I couldn't.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:06.441
You couldn't what?

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.577
You couldn't fucking
run out on me again?

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:16.251
All this time.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:19.421
All the pain.

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:26.428
All the years I spent
wondering what you were doing

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.715
and who you were with.

01:04:29.716 --> 01:04:32.000
If you were still listening
to the same songs that I was.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.538
It didn't stop, Annalisa.

01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:42.310
There were fragments of
you in every single thing

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:43.211
that I did.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.953
Do you know how
much I've struggled?

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:54.189
Do you know how much I've
had to work on myself

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:55.624
to get to where I am right now?

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:00.295
And you think what, you can
just come back into my life

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:03.164
and just press continue?

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:05.133
Okay, listen to me.

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:06.601
What else is there to say?

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:10.438
You cheated on me with
him and now you're cheating

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.273
on him with me.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:14.693
That is fucked up.

01:05:14.694 --> 01:05:16.010
When I got on that plane
in New York that night

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:19.381
I cried the entire way home.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:20.615
He called me, we made up.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:23.451
I was just so angry with you,

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:26.621
so angry about the things
we couldn't get right.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:30.392
That drove us apart,
drove each other crazy.

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:33.361
All the jealousy, it
could have been his too.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:40.068
She looks more and
more like you ever day.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.973
Her name is Audrey.

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:45.707
She's beautiful.

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.684
You look like you've
seen a bloody ghost!

01:05:55.686 --> 01:05:57.085
Who are you?

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:58.485
Who am I, who are bloody you?

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:02.290
Hey, Vincent, you got the rent?

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:04.993
We talked about it.

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:08.697
The rent.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:19.541
Vincent.

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:22.711
I come back later.

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:11.326
I know how hard this must
be for you right now.

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:17.165
Vincent.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:23.671
Do you have a picture of her?

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.452
She looks just like me.

01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:39.554
I know.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:43.591
I'm a dad.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:45.560
You are a dad.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.640
What's she like?

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:02.243
Amazing.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.079
Bright.

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.347
Funny.

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:10.635
She's a miracle.

01:08:10.636 --> 01:08:11.618
How could you keep this from me?

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:14.489
I'm sorry.

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:17.826
You know, it's hard
for me to believe now,

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:20.627
but at the time I wasn't
going to have a baby.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.430
He wanted to and
I started feeling

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.499
more comfortable about it.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:27.801
I didn't know if I was going
to have another chance.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:30.305
The longer I waited the
more maternal I felt.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.541
It's the best
decision I ever made.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.509
She's my world.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:36.611
But he's not.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:40.582
I don't know how much longer
I can keep the truth from her.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:42.484
It's not fair,
they need to know.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.888
If you tell her now
you're gonna damage her.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.490
She has to find out eventually.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:49.491
What's the difference?

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:52.292
The difference is that you
should have been honest

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.560
in the first place.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:56.031
I didn't know.

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:58.500
I didn't know for sure,
but there's no doubt now.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.437
Does he know about me?

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:03.337
No.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:06.174
What about New York?

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.211
I told him I was kind
of dating someone,

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.613
but it was complicated.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.448
Yeah.

01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:17.886
Everything in your
life is complicated.

01:09:17.888 --> 01:09:19.587
What do you want me to say?

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.558
You make things
complicated, Annalisa.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:29.296
You pack your bags and leave
after four years together.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:31.765
Four years travelling
around the world

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.569
trying to be together,
building our lives together.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.538
I come back home after
another stupid argument

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:40.308
and you're gone.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.327
And not only have you gone,

01:09:42.328 --> 01:09:44.345
but you've shut me out
of your life completely.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.247
No explanation, no
parting words, no nothing.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.783
And then you come
back five years later

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:52.787
when I am just starting
to get my shit together.

01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:57.625
And you tell me that I have
a five-year-old daughter

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:00.361
living with you and your
husband in Barcelona?

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.232
What the fuck?

01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:06.968
It's the truth.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:08.969
Oh, and that's supposed
to make things all better?

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:11.472
I came here because I wanted
to tell you the truth,

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:12.440
I needed to tell you the truth.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.475
You deserve to know.

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:15.843
Oh, I deserve to know now.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:17.512
Not five fucking years ago?

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:23.418
Well, maybe you just can't live
with the guilt anymore, huh?

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:26.254
You're relationship
is on the outs

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:28.923
and the man you used to love
or apparently used to love,

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.427
the father of your
illegitimate child

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:34.495
can actually look after
her now financially.

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:39.267
So you say maybe I can
just go play happy family.

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:42.670
Maybe I can just walk
back into his life,

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:45.607
daughter and all, five
years after I deserted him.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:46.574
Like it's that easy.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.243
That's not why I came.

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:49.844
Why then?

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:50.678
Why now?

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.913
I told you why.

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.448
Oh, that's right.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:56.017
And it took you five years
to figure that out, huh?

01:10:57.787 --> 01:10:59.821
You know laying all
this shit on me now

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:01.422
after everything
that just happened,

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:04.025
turning back the clocks,
reliving who we used to be,

01:11:04.027 --> 01:11:05.493
what we used to be together.

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:13.568
I even told you
that I loved you.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.639
And you did it to me again.

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:21.276
You screwed me over again.

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:25.980
I'm so stupid.

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:29.484
I'm so fucking stupid.

01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:32.453
No, you're not.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.721
You're beautiful.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:34.922
You're a beautiful man.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.526
So this is why you left me.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.430
I love you, Vincent.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:44.299
I've always loved you.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:46.501
I've never stopped loving you.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.436
Not a day hasn't gone by I
haven't thought about you.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:50.905
About us, about what we had.

01:11:51.741 --> 01:11:53.741
How I would have done
things different.

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.045
How many times I
would write letters

01:11:57.047 --> 01:11:59.080
explaining everything
I told you today.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:02.984
But you never sent them.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.923
You love playing the
victim, don't you?

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:12.760
Excuse me?

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.494
Yes, it was you with
the broken heart.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.564
It was you that
got screwed over.

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:19.701
But our relationship had
problems and it needed fixing.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.070
By fucking another guy?

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:23.938
And you never
fucked that actress?

01:12:25.475 --> 01:12:26.541
No.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:28.743
I was in love with you!

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:29.777
You want the truth?

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:30.845
What, is there more shit that

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.347
you've been lying to me about?

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:35.083
The truth is I'm the same
woman I've always been.

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.485
I'm not what you want me to be,

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:39.554
not what you dream
me to be, just me.

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:40.655
Me.

01:12:41.624 --> 01:12:42.857
You said you suffered
all these years

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:45.693
and I'm sorry for
that, I truly am.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.729
The thought of
your pain kills me.

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:49.564
But you need to know you
have been hurting yourself

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:50.965
for far too long.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:52.734
You need to open your eyes.

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:54.135
See things for what
they really are

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:55.837
not for what you
want them to be.

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:58.673
You can't control
other people's actions,

01:12:58.675 --> 01:13:00.108
you can only control yours.

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:04.512
I'm not the perfect girl
you want me to be, okay?

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:08.549
I get emotional,
irrational, jealous.

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.552
I screw up like anyone
else, but I'm learning.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:12.787
It's called life.

01:13:14.991 --> 01:13:16.057
Well, you didn't need
to fuck another guy

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:17.925
to know that it was wrong.

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:19.660
Life doesn't come with
a manual, Vincent.

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:20.928
Sometimes you screw up.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:24.799
But look on the flip side.

01:13:25.635 --> 01:13:28.069
You just made your
dreams come true.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.488
You made your first movie.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.906
What ever happens, you did
it, and it's from the heart.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.475
It's true and honest.

01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:37.545
It comes from a time and place
that means something to you

01:13:37.547 --> 01:13:39.113
and people are
going to feel that.

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:42.850
It's come out of your
experience with us.

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:44.585
You have a beautiful
five-year-old daughter

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.020
waiting for you.

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.454
And the woman you said
you never stopped loving

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:49.824
is here now, in this
moment, waiting for you,

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:51.926
asking for a lifetime or more.

01:13:58.067 --> 01:13:59.567
You are complicated.

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:00.601
I'm a woman!

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:05.206
I can't turn back time,
Vincent, but I can give you now.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:08.142
Now?

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:09.043
Yes, now.

01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:12.613
And what is now?

01:14:14.551 --> 01:14:16.951
Whatever we want it to be.
