00:18.651 --> 00:21.779
[Man] We've exhausted all medical
and scientifc evidence.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.621
By that I mean nothing
we can fnd... no disease,
no hint of disease. Only symptoms.

00:25.692 --> 00:30.129
The brute fact is he's experiencing
so much activity in his temporal lobe...

00:30.196 --> 00:32.664
that it is effectively
destroying his brain.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.496
Enough!

00:35.568 --> 00:37.593
There's only so much bluntness
a mother can take.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.969
- Sorry. I just...
- All you do is sedate him.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.305
You're turning him...

00:45.311 --> 00:47.404
into a zombie.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.946
I know you can hear me, Fox.

00:57.023 --> 01:00.823
- Can you give me a sign?
- [Thinking] I can hear you, Mom.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.987
Fox?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.293
[Thinking]
Mom, I can hear you.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.959
I'm here.

01:08.034 --> 01:10.366
[Thinking]
I love you, my darling boy.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.371
Mom, where you going?

01:12.439 --> 01:15.670
Mom? Mom?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.568
Come back, Mom!

01:19.646 --> 01:22.206
Mom!

01:22.282 --> 01:24.648
[Screaming]
Mom!

01:26.252 --> 01:28.982
Mom!

01:43.436 --> 01:46.894
[Man Thinking] When in disgrace
with fortune in men's eyes.

01:46.973 --> 01:50.067
Ah, but your mommy
will still love you.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.703
All a mother wants is to...

01:52.779 --> 01:55.839
shield her boy
from pain and danger.

01:55.915 --> 02:00.284
Safe in the world
as he was once in the womb.

02:00.353 --> 02:03.516
But maybe we think a father
demands more than mere survival.

02:03.590 --> 02:07.390
Maybe we're afraid a father demands
worldly adulation.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.793
Success, heroism.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.699
I know you can hear me.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.704
I can always hear you.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.234
Even when my mind is jammed
with a thousand voices,

02:24.310 --> 02:27.677
I can hear you like a snake
hissing underneath.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.910
How the hell
did you get in here?

02:30.984 --> 02:34.420
How does anything I do
surprise you now?

02:34.487 --> 02:37.422
Aren't you expecting me
to sprout vampire fangs?

02:38.525 --> 02:40.755
You've come to kill me.

02:42.228 --> 02:45.493
It'd be better than living
like a zombie, wouldn't it?

02:51.237 --> 02:53.171
[Gasps]

02:59.546 --> 03:01.776
I'm giving you a choice.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.475
[Panting]

03:05.552 --> 03:08.749
- What choice?
- Life or death.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.517
Your account is squared
with me, with God,

03:13.593 --> 03:15.993
with the I.R.S.,
with the F.B.I.

03:16.062 --> 03:18.030
Rise out of your bed
and come with me.

03:18.097 --> 03:21.828
I'm dying, you idiot.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.369
If I could get up,
I'd kick your ass.

03:24.437 --> 03:28.430
Don't be so dramatic.
Only part of you is dying...

03:28.508 --> 03:32.000
the part that played
the hero.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.603
You suffered enough...

03:34.681 --> 03:37.673
for the X-Files,
for your partner,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.684
for the world.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.744
You're not Christ.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.347
You're not Prince Hamlet.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.360
You're not even Ralph Nader.

03:48.428 --> 03:52.387
You can walk out of this hospital
and the world will forget you.

03:52.465 --> 03:55.025
Arise.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.375
What... What the hell
are you doing to me?

04:05.445 --> 04:08.573
I'm showing you how to take
the road not taken.

04:09.649 --> 04:11.583
Take my hand.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.348
- Why should I take your hand?
- You can't read my mind?

04:19.325 --> 04:22.419
No. I can't.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.589
- All the voices are gone.
- Take my hand, Fox.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.271
You have to take
the frst step.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.074
Take my hand.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.449
I'm your father.

05:37.402 --> 05:39.632
[Door Opening]

05:45.010 --> 05:48.571
Sleep is a luxury, Agent Scully.
A self-indulgence we have no time for.

05:48.647 --> 05:51.616
- Nor does Agent Mulder.
- How did you get in here?

05:53.952 --> 05:55.886
Getting in is easy.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.286
It's what you do once
you're inside that's key.

05:58.356 --> 06:02.690
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You are the only one
with access to Mulder.

06:02.761 --> 06:06.356
- I need you to use it wisely.
- Like you?

06:06.431 --> 06:10.094
Almost killing him by shooting
him full of phenytoin for
a few moments of lucidity?

06:10.168 --> 06:13.660
It's what Agent Mulder wanted.
He knows what's wrong.

06:13.738 --> 06:17.572
What he wants now is to prove it.
It's why he asked for me, not you.

06:17.642 --> 06:20.202
I don't believe that.

06:20.278 --> 06:24.977
Two years ago your partner was infected
with a virus he claimed was alien.

06:25.050 --> 06:30.215
A virus reactivated in him by exposure
to a source of energy, also alien.

06:30.288 --> 06:34.987
Agent Mulder is living proof of what
he tried so long to substantiate...

06:35.060 --> 06:37.756
the existence of alien life.

06:37.829 --> 06:41.788
But whatever it is,
it's killing him.

06:41.867 --> 06:44.062
And we have to get it
out of him.

06:46.438 --> 06:48.497
You destroy this
and I'll destroy you.

06:49.574 --> 06:52.008
[Phone Ringing]

07:00.385 --> 07:03.513
[Ringing Continues]

07:03.588 --> 07:06.955
- Scully.
- [Skinner] Agent Scully,
you need to go to the hospital.

07:07.025 --> 07:10.825
- What happened?
- Mulder's gone. He's disappeared.

07:13.565 --> 07:18.298
There were guards posted here.
A man who's gravely ill doesn't
just get up and disappear.

07:18.370 --> 07:21.168
- I know, I know.
- How did this happen?

07:21.239 --> 07:24.675
- His mother checked him out.
- His mother?

07:24.743 --> 07:28.008
- That's what they're saying.
- Has anybody spoken with her?

07:28.079 --> 07:33.346
I'm leaving that up to you.
It's better I not be involved
any further in this case.

07:33.418 --> 07:38.287
Sir, this isn't just a case. This is
Agent Mulder we're speaking about.

07:38.356 --> 07:41.052
And I'm trying
to help him...

07:41.126 --> 07:43.788
by staying out of this
from now on.

07:43.862 --> 07:45.796
Sir?

07:47.599 --> 07:50.659
I'm in a compromised position.

07:50.735 --> 07:54.865
The less I know about Agent Mulder's
whereabouts and yours,

07:54.940 --> 07:57.067
the better.

08:16.094 --> 08:19.063
[Cigarette Smoking Man's Voice]
The child is father to the man.

08:19.130 --> 08:22.190
You've been asleep
quite a while.

08:22.267 --> 08:26.499
I suspect it'll be sometime before
your sleep patterns return to normal.

08:31.343 --> 08:33.777
Would you like an explanation?

08:33.845 --> 08:35.779
I'm not sure.

08:35.847 --> 08:40.375
While you were lying unconscious
in the hospital this afternoon,
my doctors worked on you.

08:40.452 --> 08:44.912
- Why?
- At some point I realized that...

08:44.990 --> 08:47.891
if the Syndicate didn't kill you,
the F.B.I. Would.

08:47.959 --> 08:52.623
If the F.B.I. Didn't kill you,
your own misguided heroism would.

08:53.732 --> 08:56.394
There's really
no way out for you.

08:56.468 --> 09:00.404
There's no way for you
to cheat death except by disappearing.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.541
A man can't just disappear.

09:04.609 --> 09:08.204
Oh, we've made
entire cultures disappear.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.080
Like me now, you'll become
a man without a name.

09:13.985 --> 09:17.148
But even while you miss
your former identity,

09:17.222 --> 09:20.817
you'll learn to love
life's simpler pleasures.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.122
Well, that'll be kind of tough
with these on.

09:23.194 --> 09:25.754
When you no longer wanna run,
those will come off.

09:26.931 --> 09:29.058
How do you feel?

09:29.134 --> 09:31.659
I feel better than I did.

09:34.773 --> 09:37.435
I gotta tell Scully.
I gotta tell her.

09:37.509 --> 09:41.240
If you do have contact with her,
you'll put her in danger.

09:41.313 --> 09:44.805
You're entering a kind of...

09:44.883 --> 09:48.182
witness protection program
for want of a better term.

09:57.162 --> 10:01.496
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

10:01.566 --> 10:03.966
Well, maybe now you do.

10:28.393 --> 10:31.294
[Clattering]

10:48.546 --> 10:50.810
Don't move.

10:50.882 --> 10:54.249
- Who's there?
- [Man] I don't mean to frighten you.

10:54.319 --> 10:57.015
Albert Hosteen.

10:59.791 --> 11:03.352
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

11:03.428 --> 11:07.421
- I'm sorry to surprise you.
- Surprise?

11:09.167 --> 11:11.795
That you're standing here...

11:11.870 --> 11:14.839
Last time I saw you
was in New Mexico.

11:14.906 --> 11:18.364
They'd taken you from the hospital.
Your doctors feared the worst.

11:18.443 --> 11:22.402
- I was hoping to see your partner.
- He's missing.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.380
You must save him.

11:24.449 --> 11:27.009
He's very ill.

11:27.085 --> 11:29.519
You must find him
before something happens.

11:29.587 --> 11:31.714
Not only for his sake,

11:31.790 --> 11:34.190
for the sake of us all.

11:49.873 --> 11:52.171
- Where are we?
- Home.

11:55.345 --> 11:57.438
This is your new life.

12:00.984 --> 12:02.884
I don't understand.

12:10.226 --> 12:13.059
You can drive away
right now.

12:13.129 --> 12:17.429
Drive back to Scully and your X-Files
and imminent death.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.593
I wouldn't be surprised
if you did.

12:19.669 --> 12:22.661
But I think you should
take a look around.

12:22.739 --> 12:27.073
I mean, why leave something
behind until you... until you
know what it is you're leaving?

12:38.888 --> 12:41.880
[Man] Mulder was taken out of
the hospital just before 2;00 a.m.

12:41.958 --> 12:45.587
His mother's signature
is on the hospital documents.
It's her handwriting.

12:45.662 --> 12:49.098
She checked him out A.M. A...
against medical advice.

12:50.467 --> 12:52.867
It's all legitimate
until you go to surveillance.

12:52.936 --> 12:55.632
This is a camera in the hall
outside Mulder's room.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.308
Here's inside his room.

12:59.376 --> 13:02.038
And two other cameras
on the ward.

13:02.112 --> 13:05.104
We're guestimating there were
at least three others involved.

13:05.181 --> 13:07.308
Check this out.

13:09.519 --> 13:11.987
Where's Waldo?

13:16.292 --> 13:19.159
She's talking to someone.

13:19.229 --> 13:21.390
Yeah.

13:25.502 --> 13:27.493
I know who that is.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.800
[Knocking]

13:31.641 --> 13:33.666
Hello?

13:38.081 --> 13:40.015
Anybody home?

14:03.907 --> 14:05.932
[Deep Throat]
They can change your name,

14:06.009 --> 14:09.945
but they can't change
the things you love.

14:11.347 --> 14:13.281
It can't be.

14:15.185 --> 14:17.949
- You're dead.
- [Chuckles] No.

14:18.021 --> 14:20.785
No, just really relaxed.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.620
Scully...
saw you get shot...

14:25.695 --> 14:28.858
on the bridge six years ago.

14:28.932 --> 14:31.765
I was sure you were... dead.

14:35.738 --> 14:38.707
One, uh, well-placed bullet.

14:40.844 --> 14:45.577
A punctuation mark on a man's life and
you get to start a whole new chapter.

14:46.783 --> 14:48.717
I'm fine, son,

14:48.785 --> 14:52.152
aside from a little tennis elbow.

15:03.066 --> 15:06.126
I felt responsible
for your death.

15:06.202 --> 15:09.569
You can let that go.
Clearly I'm alive.

15:09.639 --> 15:12.802
I thought that you died
for my quest.

15:12.876 --> 15:16.676
Yes, along with Scully's sister and
the man you thought was your father...

15:16.746 --> 15:21.274
and Duane Barry and-and
even Scully's mysterious illness...

15:21.351 --> 15:24.252
and on and on and on.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.550
You can let go
of all that guilt.

15:26.623 --> 15:29.956
I'm here to tell you that
you're not the hub of the universe...

15:30.026 --> 15:32.517
the cause of life and death.

15:32.595 --> 15:35.496
We, you and I,

15:35.565 --> 15:39.626
are merely puppets in a master plan...
no more, no less.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.004
You've suffered enough.

15:43.072 --> 15:46.667
Now you should enjoy
your life.

15:46.743 --> 15:49.177
Let me show you something.

15:51.614 --> 15:55.072
That's my wife and daughters.

15:55.151 --> 15:57.881
We live just down the street.

15:57.954 --> 16:01.481
I hope you visit us
for dinner.

16:24.447 --> 16:28.474
Oh. Oh, hey, buddy.
That's okay.

16:28.551 --> 16:31.714
You can build it again.
Just start again.

16:31.788 --> 16:33.722
Okay?

16:40.797 --> 16:42.924
[Door Opens]

16:44.601 --> 16:46.865
Who's there?

16:48.738 --> 16:52.572
- Who are you?
- Hundreds of little joys...

16:52.642 --> 16:55.440
to open a door and have
a woman beckon you in.

16:55.511 --> 16:59.413
To have her make a fire
and lay the table for you.

16:59.482 --> 17:02.042
And when it's late,

17:02.118 --> 17:04.712
to feel her take you
into her arms.

17:20.002 --> 17:21.936
[Handcuffs Bang Floor]

17:36.952 --> 17:39.853
[Over Answering Machine] This is Tina
Mulder. I'm not in to take your call.

17:39.922 --> 17:41.947
- Please leave your message.
- [Machine Beeps]

17:42.024 --> 17:44.822
This is Dana Scully.

17:44.893 --> 17:50.263
Thank you. As before, you can reach
me at your son's office at the F.B.I.

17:50.332 --> 17:52.596
Thank you.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.267
[Sighs]

18:51.260 --> 18:54.423
- [Ringing]
- Skinner.

18:54.496 --> 18:56.396
Sir, did you send me
this book?

18:56.465 --> 18:58.490
- Excuse me?
- This book?

18:58.567 --> 19:02.094
It explains everything
that I found in Africa,

19:02.170 --> 19:04.730
using the same symbols
that I found on the ship.

19:04.806 --> 19:07.502
Agent Scully, I asked you
not to involve me in this.

19:07.576 --> 19:11.774
It's all here, sir.
A foretelling of mass extinction.

19:11.847 --> 19:16.011
A myth about a man who can save us
from it. That's why they took Mulder.

19:16.084 --> 19:19.383
They think that his illness
is a gift...

19:19.454 --> 19:21.445
a protection against
a coming plague.

19:30.098 --> 19:33.090
I'm sorry, Agent Scully. The assistant
director has given me express orders...

19:33.168 --> 19:35.762
- not to let you in.
- [Moaning]

It's all perfect.
What the hell am I doing here?

- You just need some coffee.
- No, I'm... I'm serious.

20:45.941 --> 20:49.274
I have commitments to the X-Files,
to Scully, to my sister.

20:50.946 --> 20:54.040
You think you know
what that means... commitment.

20:54.116 --> 20:56.607
- It's all just childish, Fox.
- Childish?

20:56.685 --> 20:59.711
Yes. You've been a child...

20:59.788 --> 21:01.949
with only the responsibility
of a child,

21:02.023 --> 21:04.116
to your own dreams
and fantasies.

But you won't know the true joy
of responsibility until you
plant your feet in the world...

21:11.867 --> 21:14.267
and become a father.

21:18.838 --> 21:20.772
Wow.

into domestic bliss even after
I was dropped here by a man...

- By whom?

- The National Institute of Health.

Mulder, I was so determined
to find a cure to save you...

40:15.569 --> 40:18.732
that I could deny
what it was that I saw.

40:18.806 --> 40:21.673
And now I don't even know.
I don't know...

40:21.742 --> 40:24.302
I don't know what the truth is,
I don't know who to listen to,

40:24.378 --> 40:27.404
I don't know
who to trust.

40:32.853 --> 40:35.515
Diana Fowley was found
murdered this morning.

40:39.359 --> 40:41.554
I never trusted her.

40:42.863 --> 40:46.424
But she helped save your life
just as much as I did.

40:50.104 --> 40:52.299
She gave me that book.

40:54.141 --> 40:56.234
It was her key
that led me to you.

40:57.544 --> 41:01.947
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

41:02.015 --> 41:04.040
I know she was your friend.

41:09.890 --> 41:13.121
Scully, I was like you once.
I didn't know who to trust and l...

41:13.193 --> 41:16.526
I chose another path,

41:16.597 --> 41:20.863
another life, another fate
where I found my sister.

41:22.703 --> 41:27.197
And even though my world
was unrecognizable and upside down,

41:28.442 --> 41:31.934
there was one thing
that remained the same.

41:34.014 --> 41:36.949
You were my friend...

41:37.017 --> 41:39.144
and you told me the truth.

41:42.289 --> 41:47.124
Even when the world was falling apart,
you were my constant,

41:47.194 --> 41:49.162
my touchstone.

41:51.832 --> 41:54.130
And you are mine.

42:42.416 --> 42:44.509
Ah!

43:39.638 --> 43:41.572
[Child]
I made this!
