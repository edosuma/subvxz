Carl Lipbaum died last week in summer

I heard he swallowed his vomit
during a test.

However it happened, he was
a good caddy and a good kid.

15:29.256 --> 15:31.174

You hated him.

That means the caddy scholarship
is available again...

15:36.722 --> 15:39.515

should go see Judge Smails.

15:39.683 --> 15:40.933

15:51.570 --> 15:54.822
...what kind of grades do I need
for this caddy scholarship deal?

15:54.990 --> 15:57.450

I think they're lenient.

So call the hospital...

16:00.496 --> 16:03.706
