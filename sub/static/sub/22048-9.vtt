00:03.020 --> 00:05.800
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.780
It was just a hook up.

00:07.780 --> 00:10.860
You just follow what
everyone else thinks is exciting.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.920
Chris hooked up with
someone at the party. I saw it.

00:16.020 --> 00:17.640
You saw it?
-On the staircase.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.380
Staircase?!

00:18.380 --> 00:25.860
I got an unpleasant phone call from the Rad girls
saying that as long as Eva is on our bus, we're all blacklisted.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.480
I don't understand why you're
attacking Eva, when they're the enemy.

00:29.640 --> 00:35.960
Jonas and Ingrid were a couple. So Eva only has
herself to blame for the situation she is in now.

01:13.020 --> 01:15.100
<i>[PS: On the back there's
a greeting in period blood.]</i>

01:48.720 --> 01:49.480
Hi.

01:50.780 --> 01:51.520
Hi.

02:02.380 --> 02:03.440
You were right.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.260
The Rad girls are after the entire bus.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.860
Whatever. I'm not on the bus anymore.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.340
Why not?

02:17.240 --> 02:20.620
Why bother being on a
blacklisted bus where everyone hates me?

02:22.840 --> 02:26.660
There is no one who hates you, Vilde.
-Sana made it pretty clear.

02:32.260 --> 02:35.380
Anyway, I'm back with Pepsi Max.

02:43.620 --> 02:44.460
Vilde!

02:49.380 --> 02:56.900
I just want you to know I'm not
the type of person who steals other people's boyfriends.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.380
What kind of person are you then?

03:27.420 --> 03:35.160
When I think of Foss, I see
a dude jamming on his guitar.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.200
When I think of the entrance,
I see those majestic stairs.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.600
I strongly recommend this school.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.280
<i>[Hi! I would like to change high school in the middle
of the school year.]</i>

04:39.860 --> 04:46.620
<i>[Immediately. From Nissen to some place else.
Preferably Foss. Or Elvebakken.]</i>

04:57.020 --> 04:59.460
Hi.
-Hi.

05:00.540 --> 05:02.140
You weren't at school today.

05:03.000 --> 05:03.940
No.

05:07.820 --> 05:13.440
It's really unfair
that you get this much hate.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.840
I have decided to change schools.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.040
Why?

05:22.360 --> 05:24.220
Because everything is fucked at Nissen.

05:25.980 --> 05:28.180
And that's why you're changing schools?

05:29.460 --> 05:30.140
Yes.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.420
Okay...

05:35.620 --> 05:37.140
Okay what?

05:39.300 --> 05:41.420
It's just not typical of you.

05:43.560 --> 05:49.060
What is that supposed to mean?
-I didn't know you were someone who would just give up.

05:50.940 --> 05:56.280
What is this bullshit about what kind of person
I am? Maybe I am someone who gives up!

05:56.460 --> 05:59.960
I don't know! Why would
you know what kind of person I am?

06:00.240 --> 06:06.200
Everyone is like: "What kind of person are you?
You have to know who you are!" What a fucking cliche.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.440
Yeah, ok.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.320
Just chill.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.840
I didn't mean it like that.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.520
Sorry.

06:16.920 --> 06:17.700
No...

06:23.640 --> 06:28.000
It's actually not that complicated, Eva.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.800
It's just what people do.

06:34.700 --> 06:41.640
If you want to change schools because
things are a little fucked up, you are someone who gives up easily.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.940
I'm not five years old. You thought
reverse psychology would work on me?

06:50.840 --> 06:52.880
I don't know. Does it?

06:56.940 --> 06:58.840
You've got to fight back girl

07:53.100 --> 07:53.960
Yes?

07:58.080 --> 08:02.220
Are you Maria?
Bus boss from Rad?

08:03.060 --> 08:03.940
Yes.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.100
I am Eva.

08:09.020 --> 08:09.680
Okay.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.680
I am that Eva.

08:16.900 --> 08:17.760
Okay.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.280
I just want to say that I got your letter.

08:25.680 --> 08:32.100
I know I fucked up, but I think it's unfair
to blacklist the entire bus. My friends didn't do anything.

08:32.300 --> 08:36.100
It was me. Take me, not them.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.660
Okay, Eva...

08:41.040 --> 08:44.900
You can say hi to your friends
and tell them we won't "take" them.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.820
We have more important stuff
to do than blacklisting first years.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.820
So, what's up with the letter then?

08:55.820 --> 08:58.520
We haven't given you a letter.
Someone's fucking with you.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.820
So you guys aren't mad
that I hooked up with Chris?

09:05.140 --> 09:07.740
Eva, we don't give
a shit who you've hooked up with.

09:09.820 --> 09:13.680
Even Iben's boyfriend?

09:14.300 --> 09:17.580
Even Iben's boyfriend. Eva, listen.

09:18.460 --> 09:24.680
I'm sure that in your head, this hook up is the
most important and dramatic thing you've done in your life

09:24.840 --> 09:29.540
But for us who have been here
for a while, it's only a little comma.

09:29.540 --> 09:33.000
So I suggest you accept that, okay?

09:33.440 --> 09:34.420
Okay.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.600
And relax.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.720
You shouldn't care. Youre in
the first year. You'll hook up a lot.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.060
But don't sleep around. There's a difference.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.700
When we were in our first year,
we had a chlamydia epidemic.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.340
Did you find out who started it?
-It was William.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.480
It wasn't William.

09:58.940 --> 10:00.540
Chris had it too, right?

10:01.580 --> 10:03.920
It was one of the guys for sure.

10:07.100 --> 10:21.500
<i>[Inaudible.]</i>

10:26.020 --> 10:29.800
I see what you did wrong.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.220
You did it completely wrong, Sana.
-The answer key is wrong.

10:34.780 --> 10:39.640
The answer key isn't wrong, Sana.
-It is! Because it doesn't have the same as me.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.000
Hi!

10:43.940 --> 10:44.620
Hi.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.680
I talked to the Rad girls.

10:52.580 --> 10:57.760
They aren't after us.
-Now I can finally breathe again!

10:58.520 --> 11:05.880
It's Vilde who cares about that stuff and
is peeing her pants about some blacklist.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.560
She isn't on our bus anymore.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.360
Huh?!

11:15.880 --> 11:21.880
She said she didn't want to be
on a bus where everyone hates her.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.220
Something's wrong.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.380
At the bus meeting, she was mean.
And Vilde isn't a mean person.

11:36.840 --> 11:37.780
What?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.860
It seems like you just defended Vilde?

11:42.780 --> 11:45.100
I'm just saying something's wrong.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.920
We are her friends.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.060
You guys should pay more attention to her.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.960
Okay...

12:01.220 --> 12:02.240
You guys...

12:04.900 --> 12:11.300
I feel like I owe you an explanation.
About what Vilde said about me and Ingrid.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.600
But I don't have one.

12:16.780 --> 12:19.920
I know I should've done things differently.

12:20.780 --> 12:23.920
Save that speech for Ingrid.
-Fuck Ingrid!

12:24.060 --> 12:28.460
You don't owe her shit. She was sucking up
to Iben and hooked up with Chris herself.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.760
I'm sure it was her
who sent the period letter.

12:34.060 --> 12:37.320
What are you saying now?
-You don't think it was her? I think so.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.420
Has Ingrid hooked up with Chris?

12:41.420 --> 12:45.700
Yes, I saw it at the Halloween party.
I saw her and Chris making out on the stairs.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.260
Are you kidding me?
-No, I saw it!

12:49.040 --> 12:50.980
And you're telling me this now?!

12:51.420 --> 12:53.640
What? I've told it before.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.380
I thought I told it before.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.020
We have to talk.

13:21.980 --> 13:27.540
Unless you want me to tell
Iben that you hooked up with Chris.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.880
I know you don't want
to listen to me, but you have to.

13:37.120 --> 13:41.180
Whether you want to or not,
we'll be going to the same school for the next three years.

13:41.540 --> 13:52.320
You can't keep trying to block me out,
throwing shit, or sending me threat letters.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.080
Just hear me out, okay?

14:05.300 --> 14:10.060
I moved here from Bergen in the 7th grade...

14:13.320 --> 14:16.320
No one wanted to hang out with me
because I talk so weird.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.860
You were the only
one who took care of me.

14:25.780 --> 14:29.500
I remember how proud and lucky...

14:31.180 --> 14:37.320
I couldn't believe the most popular girls
in our class wanted to be friends with me.

14:44.020 --> 14:47.840
I always really looked up to you.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.740
You're the best
friend I've ever had.

14:59.980 --> 15:04.960
Just the thought of me destroying that...

15:06.200 --> 15:08.140
... makes me feel sick.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.900
More than sick.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.800
It made me stop
liking myself as a person.

15:25.800 --> 15:31.420
But I can't continue having
regrets for the rest of my life.

15:35.780 --> 15:42.300
It wasn't going well between you and Jonas.
You talked about breaking up with him every day.

15:43.980 --> 15:47.040
I know that's not an excuse, but...

15:50.340 --> 15:51.960
I loved him.

15:55.280 --> 16:00.420
I wish I could do it
all over again, completely different.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.500
But I can't.

16:08.800 --> 16:13.480
I'm just going to have
to accept it and move on.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.240
I'm saying this for the last time.

16:19.740 --> 16:20.720
Okay?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.040
I'm sorry.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.780
I'm sorry that I lied
and went behind your back.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.220
I'm sorry that I ruined our friendship.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.580
You didn't deserve it.

16:57.320 --> 17:02.260
I'm not trying to say you should like me.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.460
Or that we should be friends again.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.700
I just...

17:09.980 --> 17:13.680
I can't bear any more threat letters, okay?

17:17.720 --> 17:18.660
Okay.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.900
No more shit.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.540
But I didn't send a threat letter.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.520
And I barely knew Iben when I hooked
up with Chris at the Halloween party.

17:38.340 --> 17:39.780
Fucking hell!

17:42.520 --> 17:44.080
Seriously?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.260
You have serious issues.

17:46.560 --> 17:51.440
What's wrong with you?
You can't just jump on people. Pull yourself together.

17:51.500 --> 17:59.420
You're with the school's largest douche. Your way
of coping with it is to jump people and send threat letters?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.300
I have a better suggestion for you...

18:03.060 --> 18:07.020
Break up with your fucking
boyfriend. He's a fucking asshole.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.160
I didn't mean it like that.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.380
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.280
I know it's true, so...

18:32.940 --> 18:34.360
I just...

18:36.500 --> 18:41.360
I think you deserve better.
Everyone deserves better than that.

18:45.180 --> 18:46.220
I love him.

18:51.140 --> 18:53.000
Maybe he'll change.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.620
It was good that he told you.

19:06.180 --> 19:06.960
What?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.120
That he had cheated.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.700
He didn't tell me

19:14.420 --> 19:16.480
He didn't?
-No.

19:20.420 --> 19:24.900
Some people told me that's
how you knew about it.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.960
That your boyfriend told you.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.300
My boyfriend?! It was
your boyfriend who tipped me off.

19:34.820 --> 19:36.220
My boyfriend?

19:36.820 --> 19:37.580
Yes.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.400
But my boyfriend didn't even know.

19:42.960 --> 19:48.420
He must've done.
It was him who sent the tip.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.520
That's how I found out about it.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.380
Huh?

19:53.740 --> 19:58.020
The little blonde one. The one
you're always with. Isn't he your boyfriend?

19:58.200 --> 20:01.100
Isak Yaki? Isak?
Isn't that what he's called?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.860
Did Isak send the tip?

20:11.620 --> 20:13.220
I thought you knew.
