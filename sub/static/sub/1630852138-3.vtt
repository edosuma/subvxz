00:29.200 --> 00:30.040
Grandma?

00:31.040 --> 00:33.160
When you and Granddad met,

00:33.240 --> 00:35.520
how did you know
you were meant for each other?

00:37.680 --> 00:41.600
I think we just knew.
We grew up together, you see.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.120
It's a small island, so…

00:45.280 --> 00:48.640
I think it was just meant to be
that we ended up together.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.240
When did you last go to Copenhagen?

00:56.120 --> 00:58.400
Not since I started a family.

01:01.880 --> 01:07.360
Don't you ever wonder what it would
be like to live there instead of here?

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
In Copenhagen?

01:14.120 --> 01:15.120
Never.

01:16.480 --> 01:21.120
The city is huge, noisy, and dirty.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.800
It's full of people.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.680
Not at all my cup of tea.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.200
My life is here.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.160
Our lives are here.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.440
And we've got a responsibility.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.920
We take care of all this…

01:38.280 --> 01:39.480
beauty.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.960
Nobody else can do that.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.360
Just you and I.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.240
We can dream all we want
of Copenhagen and the rest of the world.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.920
But we don't go there.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.720
And we don't see people from there.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.360
Do we?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.160
They took Anders.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.720
-Careful or it'll get out.
-If you're gonna be like that, just go.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.440
Jose. It's sitting over there.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.000
Do you feel better?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.120
I have some food for you.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.000
Aren't you hungry?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.160
That's disgusting!

03:57.240 --> 03:58.280
What is?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.000
I think it already ate.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.080
Is that a…

04:06.640 --> 04:07.880
Yup, that's a cat.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.320
You need to stay away from it.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.000
It didn't do that.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.080
Did the cat eat itself, then?

04:23.720 --> 04:25.200
I don't know. Perhaps.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.160
Jose, it's a predator.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.920
You'd never hurt me, would you?

04:37.640 --> 04:40.240
We're buddies. You and I.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.160
You must be hungry.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.080
I have bacon for you.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.960
Hey, are you okay?

04:53.800 --> 04:54.640
Come on.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.920
Let me help you.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.640
You're still a bit poorly.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.320
There you go…

05:12.120 --> 05:13.160
Don't worry.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.480
It'll be okay.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.560
There you go.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.000
We have to give you a name.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.800
We've always loved the island, Karen.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.160
We live here respecting nature,
making the sacrifices.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.120
But so did Anders,
and look what happened to him.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.560
He's the first person
to be attacked in 15 years.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.520
And he'll be the last.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.840
We think we know what caused the attack.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.040
We'll act straight away.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.480
We'll restore balance.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.400
I'm looking out for you.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.080
You're my responsibility.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.160
And I promise you, John and Lisbeth,

06:29.880 --> 06:31.120
that I will fix this.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.560
This is Årmandsø.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.800
Our local community
is more important than anything else.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.440
-Yes.
-Agree.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.520
Agree.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.440
We commune unbreakably with nature.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.880
Let's honor the connection.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.480
Let's honor the great sacrifice
Anders made.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.680
How many do you think there are?
Behind that fence?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.320
I don't know.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.400
I think they're locked in there.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.320
By whom?

08:31.040 --> 08:32.960
The islanders.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.040
That would be a shitty thing to do.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.040
They can't keep them captured
behind some fence.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.520
They're free like us.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.280
Maybe it's not to keep them there,
but more to protect everyone else.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.160
Against that one?

08:51.160 --> 08:52.880
Seriously. Get a grip.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.600
What is it?

08:59.520 --> 09:00.640
Still hungry?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.120
I don't have any more food.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.880
Kee-Ko. That's your name now.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.840
Kee-Ko.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.600
I'll look after you, Kee-Ko.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.760
I'll get some more food.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.200
I'll be right back.

09:38.120 --> 09:38.960
Mom?

09:39.040 --> 09:42.080
-Is this the last of the bacon?
-I think so.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.280
Whose is this, then?

09:47.760 --> 09:50.080
-Do you want to know what it is?
-Sure.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.200
Forget it.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.640
-You'll have to wait.
-Not fair!

09:52.720 --> 09:54.440
Did you sleep last night?

09:55.400 --> 09:57.360
-Yes.
-Didn't you hear Dad?

09:57.960 --> 10:00.560
He snored all night. It drove me mad.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.960
Don't you want to sit?

10:02.480 --> 10:03.360
Sure.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.360
Why don't we collect pine cones
in the forest today?

10:10.440 --> 10:12.040
-But…
-Just the girls. You and me.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.680
I was going to ask
if I could stay and read my book again.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.680
Sure. We can do that too. So…

10:19.760 --> 10:24.440
So we'll just read,
and we can light the fire and drink tea.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.360
-A day at home. Sure!
-I mean…

10:27.440 --> 10:28.680
If it's okay,

10:29.360 --> 10:32.560
I was wondering if I…
could be home alone?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.160
Of course, honey.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.960
Hi. Nice to see you.
Would you like to come in?

10:53.040 --> 10:55.320
No, thanks.
I wanted to invite you for coffee.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.240
Coffee? Today?

10:57.320 --> 11:00.280
Yes, it'd be nice to see the whole family.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.400
I know Liv would like that very much too.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.360
This is Josefine.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.400
Hi.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.480
Hi.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.040
Well, lovely then.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.000
We'll all be there.
Say, in half an hour or so?

11:15.080 --> 11:17.160
Sure, whatever suits you guys.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.080
That's a deal.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.320
We'll see you soon.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.120
Bye-bye.

11:21.880 --> 11:22.800
But, Mom…

11:22.880 --> 11:25.520
-Does that sound good to you, honey?
-Yeah.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.720
-Mom!
-Will Liv be there?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.480
Yes, Liv will be there.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.960
-Mads?
-Could you give me five minutes?

11:31.040 --> 11:34.000
-Sure, but we're invited for coffee.
-Mom.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.040
-Mom!
-What?

11:36.520 --> 11:39.760
-You said I could stay here.
-It's just for a couple of hours.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.400
It's two hours of your life.
You'll manage.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.960
-Two hours? Seriously?
-Yes, seriously.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.880
You can read when we get back.
We're doing this together.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.640
Do they have bears here?

12:04.720 --> 12:06.920
-Just keep driving.
-Did you see those traps?

12:07.440 --> 12:08.880
I saw them.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.480
Remember what we agreed.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.480
They'll soon be gone.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.560
Glad to see you found it.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.800
-Yes.
-Hi.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.720
-Thanks for the invitation.
-Hi.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.640
Yes.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.880
That looks delicious.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.640
Thank you for inviting us.

12:56.720 --> 13:00.840
Well, we don't get a lot of visitors
to the island, so do dig in.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.080
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.720
That was one of the reasons
we came to the island.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.720
We wanted time to just be alone.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.600
And what…
What have you heard about Årmandsø?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.360
We didn't hear much…

13:15.000 --> 13:16.800
Mads' colleague saw the house for rent.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.080
We saw photos. It looked beautiful.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.920
So we figured it would be
a nice place to spend Christmas.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.760
When you work long hours,
it's easy to feel disconnected.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.760
We wanted to be together.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.200
Christmas always gets
so hectic and chaotic,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.000
so this is just what we need.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.160
What are you doing on Christmas Eve?

13:42.400 --> 13:45.520
Maybe they don't celebrate Christmas.
That's okay too.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.480
A lot of people don't.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.080
We absolutely do.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.040
But Christmas can be a lot of things.

13:56.640 --> 14:01.520
For us, it's a time to think and reflect.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.520
To be grateful.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.440
You could take a leaf out of their book.
Did you hear that? Did you?

14:06.920 --> 14:10.280
Christmas is a time
to be with family and to reflect.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.520
Peaceful, you know?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.080
It's not about expensive gifts
from your parents.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.440
That's a good cake. How did you make it?

14:16.520 --> 14:19.600
It's just apples.
And butter, flour, and sugar.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.040
All produced locally.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.040
On the island.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.960
Well, then…

14:42.360 --> 14:45.880
I work long hours.
I don't have a 37-hour week.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.600
Why is there a fence around the forest?

14:49.880 --> 14:51.800
It's there because…

14:52.400 --> 14:57.360
we once lived in harmony with nature
until some people came, who…

14:58.120 --> 15:00.880
Who believed
that it's better to exploit nature.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.160
So they…

15:03.280 --> 15:05.440
They opened a lumber mill in the forest

15:06.440 --> 15:08.440
and cut it down tree by tree.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.760
Some of us fought against it, but it was…

15:14.240 --> 15:15.720
Well, it was good business.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.600
People liked the money.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.320
So my daughter,
that's Liv's mom, and also her dad…

15:22.240 --> 15:23.320
They worked there.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.200
Most people on the island did, and then…

15:28.520 --> 15:30.680
Well, then they closed the mill.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.680
There was an accident.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.720
A…

15:40.240 --> 15:41.440
A terrible accident.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.400
Some chemicals got into the ground
from the lumber mill afterwards,

15:47.480 --> 15:50.640
so that's why we put up the fence.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.440
So people don't go in there.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.440
You need to stay away.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.680
Completely away.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.040
That's just typical.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.920
As soon as we smell money,
we don't give a shit about nature.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.160
-It's a crying shame.
-May I use the bathroom?

16:09.320 --> 16:11.120
It's the first door on the left.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.880
-More cake?
-Yes, please.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.360
<i>Karen, come in. It's Møller.</i>

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
<i>I'm at the house.</i>

17:21.520 --> 17:22.720
<i>Over.</i>

17:29.640 --> 17:31.360
<i>Karen, are you there? Over.</i>

17:33.000 --> 17:34.200
Karen for Møller.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.360
<i>I've searched the barn. It's not there.</i>

17:37.440 --> 17:39.480
Keep searching until you find it.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.280
Hurry up. I don't know
how long I can keep them here.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.200
<i>Copy</i>.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.760
Excuse me. How do I get to Skovvangen?

18:01.840 --> 18:04.160
-Go to the water and follow the coast.
-Thanks.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.800
That's what interested us. Nature.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.600
It's the opposite
of what we're used to, right?

18:19.680 --> 18:21.320
Would you go look for her?

18:21.920 --> 18:23.120
Sure.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.920
I'll help you.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.200
It's time for us to go.
Thank you so much for coffee and cake.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.040
-It was all delicious.
-Jose…

18:37.800 --> 18:38.760
Jose.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.520
Typical.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.320
We need to talk.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.560
You have to get away from here.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.040
But you invited us.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.040
Not from here. From the island.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.920
Go as soon as you can. You can't be here.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.640
Liv, what's going on?

19:06.760 --> 19:08.320
We know you have one of them.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.480
A baby.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.280
Møller's on his way to remove it.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.440
What kind of creature is it?

19:20.640 --> 19:21.760
It's a forest elf.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.040
No, they're real-life, actual elves.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.400
Not like the fairy-tale ones.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.960
-Shut up. You're pulling my leg.
-They've always been here.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.080
Hiding.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.680
Isolated. That's why we built the fence.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.120
We only go there to feed them.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.080
Liv…

19:40.160 --> 19:42.200
They killed one of us.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.960
He went in and didn't come out.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.320
Those little guys?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.200
They grow bigger.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.520
Jose.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.440
Kee-Ko?

20:12.080 --> 20:13.120
Are you here?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.600
They're looking for you.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.200
Are you there?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.320
What's wrong with you?

20:44.160 --> 20:46.200
Don't be afraid. It's only me.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.280
What are you doing? Stop!

20:53.760 --> 20:54.960
No! Don't!

20:55.640 --> 20:56.640
Don't hurt it!

20:57.680 --> 20:58.720
Møller, stop!

20:59.640 --> 21:00.880
It didn't do anything!

21:03.920 --> 21:04.760
Stop!

21:05.680 --> 21:06.800
What are you doing?

21:07.320 --> 21:09.160
-Move out of the way!
-Let it go!

21:09.240 --> 21:11.040
I said stop! Leave it alone!

21:16.600 --> 21:17.760
You don't get it.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.360
You're welcome to stay until she's back.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.920
She probably ran to the house,
but thanks again.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.120
You're welcome any time.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.160
I'm bringing the baby!

22:51.360 --> 22:52.840
We didn't take it!

22:54.280 --> 22:55.400
The visitors did!

22:58.600 --> 23:01.680
It's back now,
and you took Anders, so we're even!

23:04.240 --> 23:05.440
Okay?

25:05.400 --> 25:07.720
