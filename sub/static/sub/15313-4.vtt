02:06.951 --> 02:09.282
- A good idea, Roy.
- Do we like it?

02:09.353 --> 02:10.616
I think we do!

02:12.389 --> 02:13.754
Fantastic!

02:13.824 --> 02:15.986
Roy!

02:18.698 --> 02:20.460
- Yeah, very funny.
- Very funny!

02:21.867 --> 02:23.926
Seeing it were my idea,
I keep the nag, right?

02:24.002 --> 02:27.564
Nag? This is a destrier warhorse
of the finest pedigree.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.699
Of course, my friend. You deserve it!

02:32.011 --> 02:33.239
Much?

02:33.312 --> 02:35.645
Much, do not be so easily wounded.

02:36.850 --> 02:38.510
You have it, if you're gonna cry.

02:38.584 --> 02:41.314
I am not crying!

03:00.241 --> 03:02.367
What is it?

03:02.442 --> 03:05.174
I mean, I know what it is, but...

03:05.247 --> 03:06.214
It's a boy.

03:07.316 --> 03:09.216
We could have trampled him.

03:09.285 --> 03:11.344
Where 's its mother?

03:11.419 --> 03:14.389
- This baby is cold. Mother' s long gone.
- Can't you stop it crying?

03:14.455 --> 03:16.787
- Yeah. Here you are.
- Shh...

03:19.328 --> 03:20.488
Whoa!

03:20.561 --> 03:22.655
What? That's how you shut them up.

03:22.731 --> 03:25.462
- Leave it. Let's go.
- You can't just leave a baby.

03:25.535 --> 03:28.129
What do you want to do?
We're outlaws, not wet nurses.

03:29.205 --> 03:31.832
Hey, how d'you do that?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.866
He likes me.

03:34.945 --> 03:39.007
He's lucky to be alive.
There 's hoofprints everywhere.

03:41.052 --> 03:42.349
Shh...

03:43.387 --> 03:44.547
No noise, no movement.

03:53.364 --> 03:54.662
What is it?

03:54.733 --> 03:57.395
These hoofprints. They're marked.

03:58.570 --> 04:01.801
Gisborne is not the fool he looks like.

04:01.873 --> 04:02.840
He'll track us.

04:02.908 --> 04:05.877
That's clever. You've got to admit.

04:08.747 --> 04:10.374
You didn't think of that, did you?

04:12.385 --> 04:15.980
Shouldn't we be moving on?
They could be coming already.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.115
They could be here already.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.998
- Master, what do we do?
- What can we do?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.795
We do not believe in harming man nor beast.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.103
What?

04:35.175 --> 04:36.938
Vermin, on the other hand...

04:50.792 --> 04:54.023
Do you mind?
I was just getting the baby to sleep.

05:18.321 --> 05:19.755
Robin!

05:30.935 --> 05:31.902
Roy!

05:58.698 --> 06:00.632
They got Roy.

06:02.735 --> 06:06.297
The horses were marked. They tracked us.

06:07.308 --> 06:09.003
It's a baby.

06:15.316 --> 06:17.443
John, I'm so sorry.

06:18.953 --> 06:20.921
We go to Nottingham.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.726
Good news from the village of Clun.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.621
No new outbreaks for a fortnight.

06:29.697 --> 06:32.030
The pestilence, whatever it was, is gone.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.863
Then we can lift the quarantine.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.232
Feed the survivors.

06:36.204 --> 06:38.434
The people of Clun, they are a grubby people.

06:38.507 --> 06:39.907
The great unwashed.

06:39.976 --> 06:42.604
Low on taxes, high on moaning.

06:42.678 --> 06:43.770
The quarantine remains.

06:43.846 --> 06:45.677
They must be fed. They will die!

06:45.748 --> 06:47.079
Marian...

06:47.150 --> 06:50.210
Ah! Sweet. My dear,
you have to understand.

06:50.286 --> 06:53.153
These are incapable people.
They do not look after themselves.

06:53.222 --> 06:56.158
We must not, we cannot... nanny them.

06:56.226 --> 07:00.856
But how can they look after themselves
if we will not allow them to leave their village?

07:02.232 --> 07:05.565
I agree. This is a conundrum.

07:08.572 --> 07:10.369
Another conundrum is this.

07:12.477 --> 07:15.344
Whom do I tax...

07:15.413 --> 07:18.178
to pay for the food...
for the hopeless of Clun?

07:18.249 --> 07:20.717
Hm? Do I rob from Peter to pay for Paul?

07:23.421 --> 07:26.515
Simpler to keep the quarantine in place

07:26.591 --> 07:31.223
and then after one or two weeks,
we say that the village has been...

07:31.298 --> 07:32.525
cleansed.

07:33.532 --> 07:35.523
I may house my garrison there.

07:35.601 --> 07:38.729
You cannot let healthy people die!
It is barbaric!

07:38.804 --> 07:41.137
- If it became known...
- Interesting, hm?

07:41.208 --> 07:43.403
This fire in your belly.

07:44.677 --> 07:46.374
Is this reason talking?

07:46.447 --> 07:48.539
Or is it frustration?

07:48.615 --> 07:52.107
Frustration at being...
How old now and still a maiden?

07:58.292 --> 08:00.759
Excuse me. I have other business.

08:09.103 --> 08:11.572
My name is Royston White.

08:12.407 --> 08:15.342
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard.

08:17.646 --> 08:20.080
My name is Royston White.

08:20.148 --> 08:22.447
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard.

08:25.455 --> 08:30.916
It would be wise, would it not, to break his jaw
after he has talked, rather than before?

08:32.260 --> 08:33.889
Who is he?

08:36.164 --> 08:38.498
One of his associates.

08:38.568 --> 08:41.128
Raided my stables.

08:41.203 --> 08:44.936
Unfortunately for them,
I had my horses shod with an identifying mark,

08:45.009 --> 08:47.739
which enabled me to track them down.

08:48.545 --> 08:49.671
Talk.

08:51.049 --> 08:53.847
My name is Royston White.

08:53.918 --> 08:57.183
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard.

08:57.255 --> 09:00.053
- I'll say no more.
- You've said enough.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.719
You must have had a very difficult day.

09:02.794 --> 09:04.762
What?

09:04.829 --> 09:06.420
Let our friend rest.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.125
What's happening here?

09:10.770 --> 09:13.568
Shh. Shh-shh-shh.

09:27.054 --> 09:30.319
He'll not talk, I can assure you,
unless he is beaten.

09:31.792 --> 09:34.761
First find out if he has any relatives
in Nottingham.

09:47.709 --> 09:49.700
You are back quickly.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.473
Did... Did he cry?

10:11.834 --> 10:14.235
- What's your name?
- Annie.

10:16.673 --> 10:18.641
Why d'you smile at him, Annie?

10:19.809 --> 10:20.936
He has another side.

10:22.246 --> 10:25.010
- A side he cannot show.
- You're wrong.

10:26.683 --> 10:28.617
Be careful.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.654
If I had position, I would be his wife.

10:33.358 --> 10:35.121
He tell you that, did he?

10:36.527 --> 10:38.359
I am the mother of his child.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.233
Well, you look what he did to me.

10:45.669 --> 10:48.469
Don't let him anywhere near your child.

10:50.008 --> 10:53.034
Shut up! He is a good man.

10:54.213 --> 10:57.649
He has found a good home for my baby,
the Abbey of Kirklees.

10:57.716 --> 10:59.775
That is not cheap.

10:59.851 --> 11:01.876
That will cost money.

11:05.426 --> 11:08.224
What do you want to do with it?
We're outlaws, not wet nurses!

11:20.408 --> 11:23.605
Central courtyard, portcullis. All heavily manned.

11:23.678 --> 11:27.512
- The east wall, where the builders are working?
- Teeming.

11:27.582 --> 11:29.812
- How about the south wall?
- Too high.

11:29.884 --> 11:33.342
Even if we do get in, I've heard the new door
to the dungeon's two-foot thick.

11:33.421 --> 11:38.256
I heard about the door too.
But I also heard that Robert of York put it in.

11:38.894 --> 11:39.861
And?

11:39.929 --> 11:43.057
Well, Robert of York
can't make a hinge to save his life.

11:43.132 --> 11:46.863
The lock side will be strong as an ox
but the hinge side will be weak.

11:46.936 --> 11:49.962
Especially with the weight of two foot of timber.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.014
- What's your baby called?
- None of your business.

12:07.257 --> 12:09.021
Seth.

12:10.094 --> 12:12.461
He's a few weeks old, got a velvet shawl?

12:13.264 --> 12:14.959
Yes. How...?

12:16.033 --> 12:17.728
Did you meet him on the way to the Abbey?

12:19.070 --> 12:20.264
Sort of.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.013
Sheriff wants to see you.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.688
What is the point of us all dying?

12:37.022 --> 12:40.686
"For every man there is a purpose
which he sets up in his life.

12:41.426 --> 12:44.225
"Let yours be the doing of all good deeds."

12:47.768 --> 12:48.735
That's us, lads.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.670
Is that the Bible?

12:51.739 --> 12:53.569
- It's the Qu'ran.
- What's that?

12:53.640 --> 12:56.575
It's the Turk Bible. He read it in the Holy Land.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.307
Why?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.776
I wanted to know what it was
that we were fighting.

13:12.961 --> 13:14.588
Ah!

13:15.898 --> 13:19.594
"Royston White,
I fight for King and Country."

13:19.668 --> 13:23.105
Hm? Blah-di-blah-di-blah.

13:23.172 --> 13:26.436
Now look, I'll be blunt.
I have a favor to ask.

13:27.776 --> 13:32.977
I would be very grateful if you would, um,
use this on our mutual friend Robin Hood.

13:34.451 --> 13:36.316
I'd sooner kill my own mother.

13:38.355 --> 13:41.324
Yes, what an amazing coincidence.

13:43.859 --> 13:47.125
You see, when people say things like
"I'd sooner kill me own mother"

13:47.197 --> 13:49.291
they don't usually have that statement tested.

13:52.604 --> 13:55.630
- Mother...
- Oh! Royston!

13:56.907 --> 13:58.535
I thought you were dead...

13:58.610 --> 14:02.205
- Mother...
- I thought you were dead...

14:02.280 --> 14:04.146
I was going to come back.

14:06.151 --> 14:09.143
I was going to come back
when things were better.

14:09.221 --> 14:10.654
But they never got better.

14:12.458 --> 14:15.586
Oh, yes, I like this. This is good, hm?

14:16.595 --> 14:18.085
The horns of dilemma.

14:18.163 --> 14:20.027
Kill Robin, or kill Mother.

14:20.099 --> 14:23.194
- So which is it to be?
- I'll not do it.

14:24.671 --> 14:26.434
No!

14:26.506 --> 14:30.442
You... You do not understand
what dilemma means.

14:30.510 --> 14:34.138
It means you have to do one or the other.

14:34.214 --> 14:36.079
You have to decide.

14:36.149 --> 14:38.176
And if you don't, let's just say...

14:38.252 --> 14:41.415
I'll decide for you. Hm?

14:42.923 --> 14:44.857
So...

14:46.494 --> 14:47.791
Shall we say...

14:48.529 --> 14:50.793
sunrise tomorrow? Hm?

14:50.865 --> 14:53.596
I don't know about you,
but I work best to a deadline.

14:53.669 --> 14:57.161
Of course, when people say "deadline"

14:57.239 --> 15:03.041
they don't usually mean
that somebody will be dead at the end of it!

15:14.391 --> 15:18.656
So, you've made an heroic escape,
I think, don't you?

15:20.129 --> 15:23.189
And my men, well,
they're determined to catch you.

15:23.266 --> 15:26.167
And don't forget your little badge of honor.

15:26.235 --> 15:27.636
Well, go on then, run!

15:36.914 --> 15:40.715
- What are you doing with the baby?
- Well, we can't leave him.

15:41.586 --> 15:46.524
He can't come with either. Are you gonna give
him a little dagger? A little bow and quiver?

15:46.592 --> 15:48.388
Look! There 's Roy!

15:55.500 --> 15:56.467
Roy!

16:14.788 --> 16:18.417
It is good to have you back, sir

16:18.492 --> 16:19.687
Good to be back.

16:19.761 --> 16:22.127
- How are you? You all right?
- Yeah, good, good.

16:22.196 --> 16:24.686
- Roy!
- John.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.597
- Hey, how did you escape?
- Oh, you know, um...

16:28.668 --> 16:31.728
I showed the Sheriff some of me moves!

16:31.806 --> 16:33.434
Ireckon he was impressed.

16:33.508 --> 16:35.601
Reckon he were gonna ask me to join his side.

16:36.812 --> 16:41.476
I would have said "No, thanks, mate,
I don't do red wine from Burgundy.

16:41.550 --> 16:44.542
"I'm an October Ale man, me."

16:44.619 --> 16:49.819
- So, how many did you take down?
- Oh, a few... Erm, yeah, quite a few.

16:49.893 --> 16:52.725
- What hundred? Two?
- Well, not that many. Come off it.

16:57.734 --> 17:00.328
"Moves." What does that mean?

17:05.742 --> 17:08.176
Stop! Stop! He's gonna kill us!

17:09.346 --> 17:11.040
- You what?
- Who?

17:11.115 --> 17:12.707
Him!

17:12.782 --> 17:14.272
Much?

17:15.586 --> 17:17.486
The horse. It's the same trick.

17:17.555 --> 17:19.420
They've tracked us.

17:20.491 --> 17:21.583
He's led them right to us.

17:25.931 --> 17:27.865
We're done for.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.735
Much!

17:37.242 --> 17:40.701
Well, it was possible.
You've got to admit that.

17:42.548 --> 17:46.040
Robin, I need to tell you...

17:47.386 --> 17:48.910
Something happened at the castle.

17:48.988 --> 17:50.114
Go on.

17:53.526 --> 17:55.325
I...

17:55.396 --> 17:57.124
I've something that...

17:59.132 --> 18:00.156
What is it?

18:02.603 --> 18:04.537
I know the baby's name.

18:05.473 --> 18:07.565
- OK.
- It's Seth.

18:07.641 --> 18:09.371
He's called Seth.

18:09.444 --> 18:13.175
I met the father in the castle dungeon.
Just for stealing bread.

18:13.848 --> 18:15.816
It looks like the mother.

18:15.884 --> 18:19.752
The thought of raising the child on her own,
she must have panicked and brought it here.

18:19.821 --> 18:22.813
This Sheriff. He's destroying lives.

18:22.891 --> 18:28.057
The mother lives out in Knighton. You and I, we
go and give her some money to keep the child.

18:28.130 --> 18:29.961
Are we moving on?

18:30.032 --> 18:31.660
No. Erm...

18:32.736 --> 18:34.704
Meet at sunset at the long stone.

18:35.605 --> 18:37.835
- Where are you going?
- Knighton.

18:37.907 --> 18:39.876
To take the baby home.

18:39.942 --> 18:42.411
Roy knows where he lives.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.242
- Well, shall I come?
- Er, no!

18:46.316 --> 18:48.751
More than two, we attract attention.

18:49.954 --> 18:52.080
Ah, good.

18:52.155 --> 18:54.920
I'll stay here, sort things out.

18:56.126 --> 18:59.756
I thought we could have rabbit,
you know, for supper.

19:08.974 --> 19:11.339
- Lady Marian!
- Good day.

19:11.409 --> 19:14.573
- What can I do for you?
- I need five minutes in the village.

19:14.646 --> 19:16.374
- Ah. That I cannot do.
- Please...

19:16.447 --> 19:17.973
- I cannot.
- Please...

19:18.051 --> 19:21.111
- No!
- Step aside, I have business in the village.

19:21.187 --> 19:23.416
There is a quarantine, you know that. Pestilence.

19:23.488 --> 19:26.083
The pestilence is long gone, you know that.

19:26.159 --> 19:29.151
- And if you don't you are a fool.
- Sheriff's orders.

19:29.228 --> 19:32.891
I am the daughter of the old Sheriff
and I am ordering you to step aside.

19:33.399 --> 19:35.129
The people in here are starving.

19:42.543 --> 19:45.341
If the Sheriff knew your game,
he'd have your guts for garters.

19:45.412 --> 19:47.937
The pestilence is gone. These people need food.

19:48.015 --> 19:51.042
Oh! Nice pie.

19:52.020 --> 19:54.045
How about a nice kiss to go with it?

19:54.122 --> 19:56.215
Don't you touch me!

19:56.291 --> 19:58.919
Everybody still, if you please.

20:11.807 --> 20:13.434
Having a little trouble?

20:13.509 --> 20:15.773
Nothing I cannot resolve myself, thank you.

20:16.645 --> 20:18.613
Sword.

20:19.715 --> 20:21.842
The village has been starved.

20:21.918 --> 20:25.513
The disease has gone but the Sheriff
has not lifted the quarantine.

20:25.589 --> 20:28.319
He wants the village for accommodation.

20:29.192 --> 20:30.922
Roy, tie them.

20:37.367 --> 20:39.461
And what was your plan?

20:39.537 --> 20:41.528
To sweet-talk the guards?

20:41.606 --> 20:43.904
Bad idea.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.503
Oh, and you have a better one?

20:52.917 --> 20:55.318
Look! It's bread.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.014
Quick, everyone!

20:57.090 --> 20:59.717
Run, run! Come on! Quickly, quickly!

21:03.229 --> 21:06.096
Bless you, Robin Hood!
Bless you, Robin Hood!

21:10.636 --> 21:12.264
That is a waste of arrows.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.034
No...

21:15.108 --> 21:16.576
You could simply throw the food.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.736
We could...

21:19.813 --> 21:21.940
but where would be the fun in that?

21:26.853 --> 21:28.287
- Aaargh!
- Robin!

21:29.224 --> 21:31.624
Get up! Come on, let's get out of here.

21:40.602 --> 21:42.125
Robin, let me help you.

21:44.271 --> 21:47.207
No! Feeding the poor
is foolish but understandable.

21:48.076 --> 21:50.807
Helping me is a hanging offence.
Give me the baby.

21:51.881 --> 21:55.578
- This is no sport for a woman.
- More than it is for a child? Is he yours?

21:55.651 --> 21:57.881
Robin!

21:57.954 --> 21:59.444
- Split up.
- But...

21:59.522 --> 22:00.648
No buts.

23:01.454 --> 23:02.978
Where did you get that dagger?

23:05.559 --> 23:08.154
And announce yourself next time,
I could have killed you.

23:11.632 --> 23:13.623
Did we lose them?

23:13.701 --> 23:15.259
We are alone.

23:15.904 --> 23:17.700
I said split up.

23:18.372 --> 23:20.272
You disobeyed me.

23:20.842 --> 23:22.331
I'm glad you did.

23:24.781 --> 23:26.840
It will soon be dark.

23:26.916 --> 23:32.649
Our mission to reunite mother and child
should maybe wait a day. What do you think?

23:32.721 --> 23:34.518
It cannot wait.

23:34.590 --> 23:35.750
What d'you mean?

23:36.825 --> 23:38.759
- Robin, I'm sorry...
- Robin?

23:43.499 --> 23:45.467
Don't just stand there.

24:08.659 --> 24:10.628
Do you know me?

24:12.430 --> 24:13.863
- Lady Marian.
- No.

24:13.932 --> 24:16.197
You have not seen me, understand?

24:17.503 --> 24:19.403
- As you wish.
- Can you help me?

24:24.843 --> 24:26.778
This needle is thick and blunt.

24:26.846 --> 24:28.313
Are you prepared?

24:28.381 --> 24:29.814
It's the way you sell it.

24:29.882 --> 24:31.874
You'll need to take off your shirt.

24:44.264 --> 24:45.788
Saracen attack on the King.

24:47.502 --> 24:49.663
Caught us unawares.

24:49.737 --> 24:51.500
To this day, I do not know how.

24:51.572 --> 24:53.062
Is this why you returned?

24:54.242 --> 24:57.302
The stitching became infected.
I took a fever.

24:57.378 --> 25:02.042
And when I awoke, the King had gone south
and left orders for me to return to fully recover.

25:02.116 --> 25:04.347
So you return and take instantly
to the woods?

25:06.388 --> 25:07.878
Ah!

25:07.956 --> 25:11.517
It must be clean or you will take another fever.

25:13.796 --> 25:16.594
So... you never told me.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.562
When I was in the Holy Land,
you must have had suitors?

25:21.304 --> 25:23.636
- Ah!
- I must have.

25:25.409 --> 25:28.605
- Well, it is surprising you are not married.
- It is.

25:28.678 --> 25:32.375
And yet, when one considers that
marriage requires a man, perhaps not.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.281
A word of advice.

25:35.352 --> 25:38.948
Your charms, such as they are,
ceased working on me at least five years ago.

25:39.023 --> 25:40.616
- A challenge.
- A statement.

25:40.691 --> 25:41.681
- Ow!
- That hurt?

25:41.759 --> 25:42.953
- Yes!
- Good.

25:45.229 --> 25:46.595
Just tying off.

25:53.740 --> 25:55.172
Kiss it better?

25:55.775 --> 25:57.606
Ah!

25:57.677 --> 25:59.337
Done.

26:06.118 --> 26:07.746
Are you spying?

26:07.820 --> 26:09.789
Up to no good?

26:13.861 --> 26:16.420
Sorry! I heard crying.

26:16.496 --> 26:19.864
This is the milk
and cheese for the mother.

26:20.466 --> 26:22.434
This is not our child.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.035
Master

26:29.443 --> 26:31.708
- Master
- Stay here.

26:36.918 --> 26:39.887
Your horse returned without you.

27:07.384 --> 27:09.851
- Can you take the baby?
- Me?

27:09.920 --> 27:13.048
- Its mother lives in Knighton.
- What, because I am a woman?

27:14.157 --> 27:16.285
Because I have to go. My men are here.

27:17.695 --> 27:18.992
The call of the wild.

27:21.232 --> 27:25.601
Marian... why is it that everything
you say to me sounds like a criticism?

27:25.670 --> 27:27.262
I do not know.

27:27.338 --> 27:30.034
I suppose these are the lives we have chosen.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.404
Always different directions.

27:31.476 --> 27:36.312
- And yours is the better direction?
- I work within the system. It is the only way.

27:36.381 --> 27:38.349
Not at night.

27:38.417 --> 27:41.046
You dress up as... Who is it?

27:41.119 --> 27:44.520
- The Nightwatchman.
- I do not taunt the Sheriff.

27:44.590 --> 27:46.956
I do not publicly flout his decisions.

27:47.025 --> 27:49.153
OK, so today, at Clun?

27:49.229 --> 27:51.595
That was different. It was an emergency.

27:53.233 --> 27:54.325
And you were wonderful.

27:56.102 --> 27:57.763
You were bold and...

27:58.638 --> 28:00.936
I wish there were more emergencies...

28:02.141 --> 28:04.838
- Is it all a big joke to you?
- Is it all so serious to you?

28:04.912 --> 28:07.142
Forgive me for being careful.

28:07.215 --> 28:10.115
But so far nobody has had their
tongue cut out because of me!

28:12.152 --> 28:13.119
Take your baby.

28:29.305 --> 28:31.238
A storm 's coming from the east.

28:31.307 --> 28:33.240
A forest is no place to have a bairn.

28:33.309 --> 28:36.335
- You stay here tonight.
- Thank you.

28:36.412 --> 28:39.108
- No, no, no, we can't.
- Why?

28:39.181 --> 28:41.115
We've got to get the baby back to its mother.

28:41.183 --> 28:42.708
Do it tomorrow.

28:42.785 --> 28:44.309
Yes, exactly.

28:44.388 --> 28:46.218
Now, get inside, all of you.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.881
I want you gone before dawn.

29:05.175 --> 29:09.010
Rumors abound. The pestilence is over.

29:09.079 --> 29:10.810
It is over.

29:10.883 --> 29:15.182
No, no, my dear,
that was between you and me...

29:15.253 --> 29:19.246
and the Council of Nobles.
You see, now we have a problem.

29:19.324 --> 29:22.123
Either I say you were wrong,
you made a mistake

29:22.194 --> 29:24.525
and leave the quarantine in place...

29:24.597 --> 29:25.962
I was not wrong.

29:26.031 --> 29:29.467
Or I say you were right,

29:29.535 --> 29:31.197
lift the quarantine,

29:31.271 --> 29:33.637
let the layabouts live,

29:33.707 --> 29:36.573
and then look for somewhere else
to house my garrison.

29:36.643 --> 29:38.439
Then say I was right.

29:40.213 --> 29:42.340
No, you see, there 's always a catch.

29:43.884 --> 29:46.785
In politics there 's always a deal.

29:46.854 --> 29:51.484
If I were to say that you were right,
then I would lose face.

29:54.729 --> 29:57.129
Well, that can't happen, hm?

29:57.198 --> 29:58.460
We must have authority.

30:01.403 --> 30:03.394
So, I'll have to punish you.

30:04.940 --> 30:06.532
For your outspokenness.

30:07.776 --> 30:09.175
Punish me?

30:14.916 --> 30:19.877
I do not listen to suggestions
that you were consorting with Robin Hood.

30:21.257 --> 30:23.725
That would be unforgivable.

30:28.297 --> 30:30.857
What punishment?

30:30.934 --> 30:33.368
Oh, don't worry, nothing personal.
Just politics.

30:34.805 --> 30:36.830
It would have to hurt, though.

30:38.208 --> 30:39.334
What punishment?

30:54.126 --> 30:55.456
Marian!

31:00.565 --> 31:02.533
Long and flowing.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.862
Sweet.

31:13.612 --> 31:18.743
We cannot have
challenges to our authority.

31:20.586 --> 31:22.556
The law...

31:22.622 --> 31:24.852
applies to everybody.

31:27.961 --> 31:29.121
Even the privileged.

31:43.211 --> 31:45.271
Ahh.

31:45.347 --> 31:47.474
Wasted beauty.

31:48.484 --> 31:49.882
Humiliation.

31:49.951 --> 31:53.353
Sometimes so much better than execution.

32:28.058 --> 32:29.890
Roy? What are you doing?

32:29.961 --> 32:31.622
Sorry.

32:33.899 --> 32:35.264
Master

32:35.333 --> 32:37.028
Get up, wake up!

32:37.102 --> 32:40.037
What are you doing? We came to rescue you!

32:40.105 --> 32:43.302
Every man here
was willing to risk his life for you!

32:43.375 --> 32:46.573
I've got to kill him! I've got to kill him!

32:46.646 --> 32:50.082
In war, a rescued man owes his life
to his rescuers.

32:50.149 --> 32:52.811
He gives his life like that
for the men who saved him.

32:52.885 --> 32:54.409
What is going on?

32:54.487 --> 32:56.580
This one tried to kill Robin.

32:56.656 --> 32:58.749
What?

33:07.367 --> 33:09.335
You were like my son.

33:20.181 --> 33:21.774
Kill me.

33:22.617 --> 33:25.849
I will... kill... you!

33:30.091 --> 33:31.490
- John, leave it!
- I'll kill him.

33:31.559 --> 33:33.720
- John, that's enough.
- Kill him!

33:35.731 --> 33:38.700
Listen to me. Listen to me!

33:38.767 --> 33:40.234
That's enough.

33:41.337 --> 33:43.898
Enough. I need to think.

33:43.974 --> 33:45.440
Stop. Now.

34:08.466 --> 34:10.696
What have I ever done to you
to make you want to kill me?

34:13.405 --> 34:16.635
My mother. They've got me mother.

34:20.411 --> 34:22.208
And they will kill her...

34:23.315 --> 34:24.679
unless you kill me first?

34:24.750 --> 34:26.945
She'll hang at dawn.

34:31.658 --> 34:33.649
I hate the Sheriff.

34:43.637 --> 34:45.297
And the story about the child's mother?

34:46.739 --> 34:48.571
That was a lie too?

34:48.641 --> 34:50.234
Gisborne is the father.

34:50.311 --> 34:51.744
Gisborne?

34:52.946 --> 34:54.744
The mother' s a kitchen girl.

34:56.216 --> 35:00.278
She thinks Gisborne's going to take the child
to Kirklees Abbey, to be raised there.

35:00.355 --> 35:01.982
I hate Gisborne too.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.753
That doesn't mean that this one
can go around killing my master.

35:07.996 --> 35:10.897
- Come on.
- What?

35:12.367 --> 35:15.234
We have two mothers
to rescue before sunrise.

36:32.585 --> 36:34.553
- Annie?
- Yeah.

36:35.991 --> 36:37.651
I think this belongs to you.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.244
Mother?

37:28.313 --> 37:33.080
- Mother?
- Mary! Mary!

37:33.718 --> 37:35.844
- Mary?
- Mother

37:39.457 --> 37:40.481
Mary? Mary?

37:40.558 --> 37:44.791
- Mary? Mary?
- Where is she? What have you done wi' 'er?

37:44.864 --> 37:48.527
Gisborne. What do you think?
Does that look like the first light of day?

37:50.503 --> 37:53.438
- Mm-hm.
- Mm. Well, I kept my side of the bargain.

37:53.506 --> 37:55.872
You didn't keep yours.

37:55.941 --> 38:00.606
So, bring them to see "Mary, Mary"...

38:00.680 --> 38:01.704
swing.

38:16.931 --> 38:18.899
Mother

38:18.966 --> 38:20.365
Erm... No hood, I think.

38:22.370 --> 38:23.962
You'll rot in hell for this.

38:24.038 --> 38:25.630
Really? Just for this?

38:29.110 --> 38:31.807
"Mary, Mary's boy's contrary"

38:31.880 --> 38:33.575
"Time to see her swing."

38:34.516 --> 38:37.452
Murderers! I will kill you!

38:37.519 --> 38:40.147
- Annie...
- Do not move!

38:40.222 --> 38:44.158
You left him in the woods.
You said he would be safe!

38:44.726 --> 38:46.354
You left him to die.

38:46.429 --> 38:48.989
Our son! Our baby!

38:49.065 --> 38:50.363
Gisborne!

39:20.465 --> 39:22.262
Robin!

39:25.270 --> 39:26.966
To the horses!

39:28.908 --> 39:31.102
Come on, then!

39:36.248 --> 39:37.409
Locksley!

39:39.186 --> 39:41.380
Why so much haste, my friend?

39:42.355 --> 39:45.483
Sorry to ruin your day,
but if you leave he gets it.

39:46.592 --> 39:49.493
This is our old friend the dilemma calling.

39:50.731 --> 39:53.564
Master, you cannot give yourself
up every five minutes.

39:53.634 --> 39:56.069
- Robin, no.
- Robin, yes!

39:56.137 --> 39:57.467
Let him go.

39:57.537 --> 39:59.870
Or we all die here today.

39:59.941 --> 40:03.637
Oh, come along, Robin, we both of us know
we've had this conversation many times,

40:03.710 --> 40:07.442
and we also know that you're
not the killing kind. But me...

40:07.514 --> 40:12.180
Raaghh! Run!
For my mother For the baby!

40:13.322 --> 40:14.584
No, Roy!

40:18.093 --> 40:22.029
My name is Royston White.
I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard!

40:25.334 --> 40:28.792
He does this for you. Come.

40:28.872 --> 40:31.102
...King Richard!

40:35.045 --> 40:36.103
Robin, come on...

41:20.127 --> 41:22.152
Him...

41:22.229 --> 41:23.889
I liked.

41:55.598 --> 41:56.996
Your hair...

41:57.065 --> 41:58.499
It was a nuisance to wash.

42:10.447 --> 42:11.471
Thank you, my Lady.

42:11.548 --> 42:14.711
Lady Glasson is a good mistress,
you will be well looked after.

42:14.785 --> 42:16.012
And Seth too.

42:17.788 --> 42:18.755
And you too.

42:18.822 --> 42:20.414
Thank you.

42:20.891 --> 42:24.453
- From me but especially from...
- Go.

42:24.529 --> 42:25.655
You have a long journey.

42:27.498 --> 42:29.466
One thing.

42:30.133 --> 42:32.068
We, um...

42:36.507 --> 42:38.304
- Open it later.
- Thank you.

42:48.419 --> 42:51.513
I am going... this way.

42:52.691 --> 42:54.660
I'm going...

42:56.596 --> 42:58.563
Always different directions.

43:10.043 --> 43:11.909
I have to say,
I'm not gonna miss that baby.

43:13.247 --> 43:14.339
Me neither.

43:17.017 --> 43:19.110
Peace.

43:19.186 --> 43:21.017
Sleep.
