if you wanted to.

03:25.389 --> 03:26.890
Well, I don't.

03:26.892 --> 03:29.225
I would come out
and say so if I did,

03:29.227 --> 03:31.194
and I suggest
that you man up

03:31.196 --> 03:33.229

that's what you want,

03:50.449 --> 03:52.916
Then go.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.395
Let's get started.

04:05.397 --> 04:07.530
Memphis division
is reporting 3 abductions

04:07.532 --> 04:09.566
in the last 48 hours.

04:09.568 --> 04:12.502
Michael Smith, age 59,
Trevor Burkett, age 23,

04:12.504 --> 04:14.971
and the latest victim,
Christy White, age 21.

04:14.973 --> 04:17.474
They were all taken
from parking lots late at night.

04:17.476 --> 04:19.242
Trevor and Michael's cars
were left abandoned.

04:19.244 --> 04:20.844
The third victim, Christy White,
went to a supermarket

04:20.846 --> 04:22.345
with her friend Debbie
Martin last night.

04:22.347 --> 04:23.513
The unsub
attacked Debbie first

04:23.515 --> 04:25.148
but ultimately
left her behind.

04:25.150 --> 04:27.851
Debbie was released from the hospital
this morning with a concussion,

04:27.853 --> 04:29.552
and what we know
from the police report

04:29.554 --> 04:31.321
is that the unsub
wears a pig mask,

04:31.323 --> 04:34.524
and he's using a taser
to incapacitate his victims.

04:34.526 --> 04:36.826
So does this unsub just
lie in wait in parking lots

04:36.828 --> 04:38.528
for victims of opportunity?

04:38.530 --> 04:40.964
It's pretty bold, then,
attacking two girls at once.

04:40.966 --> 04:43.666
Maybe he's on a timetable
and couldn't wait for a lone victim.

04:43.668 --> 04:45.702
Well, if he is, the distance he's
traveled doesn't help.

04:45.704 --> 04:47.537
It was over 60 miles
between each crime scene.

04:47.539 --> 04:49.772
These 3 were taken from
all over west Tennessee.

04:49.774 --> 04:53.343
Well, it's possible he knew them
and they were all specific targets.

04:53.345 --> 04:54.544
Why the pig mask?

04:54.546 --> 04:56.546
I mean, obviously he's
shielding his identity,

04:56.548 --> 04:58.348
but is there some other
meaning here?

04:58.350 --> 04:59.916
You know, the symbolism
really runs the gamut.

04:59.918 --> 05:01.818
Pigs can stand for anything
from greed and laziness

05:01.820 --> 05:03.820
to celebration and good luck,
not to mention

05:03.822 --> 05:05.288
the derogatory nickname
for cops.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.457
Well, the other question
is, what's he doing with the victims?

05:07.459 --> 05:08.825
No bodies were discovered.

05:08.827 --> 05:10.994
Well, he's either got
a secluded disposal site

05:10.996 --> 05:12.662
or he's got
a longer-term plan.

05:12.664 --> 05:14.697
These victims
could still be alive.

05:14.699 --> 05:16.199

Trevor Burkett
is a senior at Mecklenburg State,

06:50.436 --> 06:52.970
and Christy White
is a sophomore at Ripley University.

06:52.972 --> 06:55.306
And both students
are roughly the same age,

06:55.308 --> 06:57.608
but Michael Smith
is a retiree in his late 50s.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.243
Which one of these
is not like the other?

06:59.245 --> 07:01.779
The unsub seems not to have
an age or a gender preference.

07:01.781 --> 07:05.249
So he probably wasn't
driven by any sort of sexual desire.

07:05.251 --> 07:06.751
He could be holding
them all together,

07:06.753 --> 07:08.552
which may mean they're
surrogates of some kind.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.354
That would also explain why
he left Debbie Martin behind.

07:10.356 --> 07:13.391
She was African American and
the rest of his victims were Caucasian.

07:13.393 --> 07:15.092
Maybe she didn't fit
his parameters.

07:15.094 --> 07:17.929
Well, Michael Smith was
the first victim abducted.

07:17.931 --> 07:20.298
Do you think it was
logistical or intentional?

07:20.300 --> 07:22.934
Either way, the first
victim is usually the most significant

07:22.936 --> 07:24.435
and Michael's
the odd man out.

07:24.437 --> 07:26.637
I'll have Garcia dig deeper
into his history.

go talk to Debbie Martin.

set up at the field office.

tell us what you remember

was the pig mask

08:07.714 --> 08:09.380

08:48.688 --> 08:51.822
Unsub had plenty of time
to take Debbie Martin, too,

08:51.824 --> 08:53.357
but he just left her there.

08:53.359 --> 08:56.327
So they're not surrogates.
Christy White was his specific target.

08:56.329 --> 08:58.556
Which means he probably
stalked Christy

08:58.581 --> 08:59.698
and was expecting her to be alone.

08:59.699 --> 09:02.233
Debbie was a hiccup
in his plan, so he adjusted.

09:02.235 --> 09:04.568
The unsub went to great lengths
to stage the abductions

09:04.570 --> 09:07.038
in rapid succession, as if
they were orchestrated.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.374

09:19.585 --> 09:22.253
He claims he was home alone
the night Smith disappeared,

09:22.255 --> 09:24.755
but not a soul
can corroborate it.

09:24.757 --> 09:26.390

with Mike?

09:37.904 --> 09:40.237

instead of talking to me?

to talk to him.

that night?

about our missing
college boy Trevor Burkett.

about that?

11:14.467 --> 11:17.301
they're weirdly, strangely,
a lot into pigs.

11:17.303 --> 11:18.770

to do with one of their

They had a pig party every year.
Everyone wore a pig mask.

11:22.575 --> 11:24.108
Oink to the oink-oink.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.876
What's the second thing,
Garcia?

11:25.878 --> 11:27.478
This is where your bacon
gets extra-crispy.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.214
A little over a year ago,
a pledge named James Linwood

11:30.216 --> 11:31.682
took a leap off a roof.

11:31.684 --> 11:33.651
Let me guess.
He was drunk and/or on drugs.

11:33.653 --> 11:36.053
Ah. I see you've been
to a frat party before.

11:36.055 --> 11:37.855
Yeah, according
to tox reports, he was.

11:37.857 --> 11:40.491
I believe the technical
term is "hammered."

11:40.493 --> 11:42.293
It was during
one of these pig parties,

11:42.295 --> 11:46.330
where the pledges are hazed
and then forced to imbibe like crazy.

11:46.332 --> 11:48.032
Did the kid survive?

11:48.034 --> 11:49.833
Negative. He sustained
a fatal brain injury,

11:49.835 --> 11:51.101
and after his death,

11:51.103 --> 11:53.504
Beta Sigma Delta lost their chapter
and was shut down.

11:53.506 --> 11:55.072
No one was charged
or prosecuted, though.

11:55.074 --> 11:57.374
I'm sending all of this
to your tablets now.

11:57.376 --> 11:58.676
If the abductions
have anything to do

11:58.678 --> 11:59.843
with what happened
that night,

11:59.845 --> 12:01.245
this could be
about revenge.

12:01.247 --> 12:03.480
And the unsub could be
working off some sort of hit list.

12:03.482 --> 12:04.882
Thanks, Garcia.

12:07.452 --> 12:11.222
I can't believe we're here!
A dream come true!

12:11.224 --> 12:14.858

13:42.478 --> 13:44.045

13:44.047 --> 13:46.448
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:49.418 --> 13:54.122
[Raspy labored breathing]

13:54.124 --> 13:56.858
All right, thank you.

14:00.963 --> 14:04.933
According to his doctor,
Trevor was badly tortured.

14:04.935 --> 14:07.669
Looks like he was forced
to drink hydrochloric acid,

14:07.671 --> 14:10.305
and he was sodomized
with a blunt penetrating object.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.773
Wow.

14:11.775 --> 14:15.143
Well, we're obviously
dealing with a sadist.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.711
But why leave Trevor alive?

14:16.713 --> 14:18.146
It doesn't match
the typical M.O.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.081
Yeah, if anything,
he would have inflicted more pain

14:20.083 --> 14:21.583
and tortured his victim
to death.

14:21.585 --> 14:23.118
That's true.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.589
So the unsub wanted Trevor
to experience mental anguish.

14:27.591 --> 14:31.292
So he disfigured him
with the acid, but only to his face.

14:31.294 --> 14:33.261
So appearance
is important to him.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.896
And the acid could be
a form of poisoning.

14:34.898 --> 14:37.298
And let's not forget
a taser was used.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.704
The unsub didn't have
the physical strength

14:40.026 --> 14:41.726
to control his victims.

14:41.771 --> 14:43.872
Ok, wait a minute.
When you add up poison,

14:43.874 --> 14:46.608
cleanliness, and the use of a taser
to overwhelm the victims,

14:46.610 --> 14:47.942
we can't rule out
the possibility

14:47.944 --> 14:49.410
that our unsub
just might be female.

14:49.412 --> 14:52.180
We need to give
the profile.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.482
This unknown subject
is an injustice collector

14:54.484 --> 14:56.417
who's delivering
transferred vengeance.

14:56.419 --> 14:58.586
We believe this unsub
may also be a woman

14:58.588 --> 15:00.989
and that she's on a mission to punish
those she's deemed responsible

15:00.991 --> 15:02.490
for the death
of James linwood.

15:02.492 --> 15:05.493
The pig mask they wear
is the same one worn by pledges

15:05.495 --> 15:07.495
of the Beta Sigma Delta
fraternity,

15:07.497 --> 15:09.097
as a reminder
of that fatal night.

15:09.099 --> 15:10.698
We believe the victims
are being tortured as payback

15:10.700 --> 15:12.600
for their role
in Linwood's death.

15:12.602 --> 15:14.969
One of the abductees,
Trevor Burkett,

15:14.971 --> 15:17.405
escaped or was released
after being forced to drink

15:17.407 --> 15:18.673
hydrochloric acid.

15:18.675 --> 15:21.142
We believe the acid symbolizes
the excessive alcohol

15:21.144 --> 15:23.611
the loved one was forced
to drink the night he died.

15:23.613 --> 15:25.647
Scarring these victims
will ensure that the world

15:25.649 --> 15:27.081
never forgets
what they've done.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.817
The unsub is exhibiting
a level of sexual assault and torture

15:29.819 --> 15:32.520
which is normally atypical
for female offenders,

15:32.522 --> 15:33.645
but it is seen when

15:33.670 --> 15:35.871
there's been years and years
of built-up rage and anger.

15:44.033 --> 15:46.568
Reid: Like Los Angeles
cop killer Christopher Dorner,

15:46.570 --> 15:47.933
injustice collectors

15:47.958 --> 15:49.958
believe they've been dealt
a lifetime of unfairness

15:50.507 --> 15:53.341
and believe that nobody treats them
with the respect they deserve.

15:53.343 --> 15:56.344
Morgan: But in reality, they're
simply masking insecurities and fears

15:56.346 --> 15:57.912
by solely placed
the blame on others.

15:57.914 --> 15:59.514
This means the unsub's
next target

15:59.516 --> 16:01.816
will probably be
another fraternity member

16:01.818 --> 16:04.586
or someone who attended
the party where Linwood was killed.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.721
It could also be someone
from the university

16:06.723 --> 16:09.224
whom the unsub perceives
as having played a role in his death.

16:09.226 --> 16:11.693
So we need you to warn students,
faculty, and staff at Mecklenburg State

16:11.695 --> 16:13.228
they need to stay aware
and alert.

16:13.230 --> 16:14.429
Even the loosest affiliation

16:14.431 --> 16:16.831
could be magnified
in the unsub's psyche.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.333
At this point
we have to believe

16:18.335 --> 16:20.368
that Christy White
and Michael Smith are still alive

16:20.370 --> 16:21.869
but are undergoing
severe torture.

16:21.871 --> 16:23.571
So time is
of the essence.

the ventilator is shut off,

16:44.594 --> 16:47.095
after oxygen has been
cut off from the brain.

16:47.097 --> 16:49.831
Will she feel anything?

16:50.899 --> 16:53.768
Some people have said
patients make rattling sounds

16:53.770 --> 16:55.870
when they're disconnected.

16:55.872 --> 16:58.072

just the equipment.

Me and Trevor
were roommates,

but to be honest,
I barely saw him

17:48.892 --> 17:52.327
after we moved out of
the Beta Sigma Delta house.

Do you recognize this girl?
Her name's Christy White.

17:54.964 --> 17:57.732

I was really wasted.

aren't aware of.

to cross-check on things,

24:42.277 --> 24:44.143
so I did just that
with Christy White's

24:44.145 --> 24:46.245
texts, emails,
and social media,

24:46.247 --> 24:48.648
of which there are literally
thousands of messages,

24:48.650 --> 24:51.317
and I found you a 19-year-old
Lauryn-Anne Harrison,

24:51.319 --> 24:54.420
Lauryn-hyphen-Anne
being her full first name,

24:54.422 --> 24:56.322
which is why she didn't
show up in my initial search.

24:56.324 --> 24:57.757
And what's her deal?

24:57.759 --> 24:59.725
Her deal is that she took
an English lit class with Christy.

24:59.727 --> 25:02.061
They've been in touch
sporadically, but their last exchange

25:02.063 --> 25:03.930
was the night
James Linwood died.

25:03.932 --> 25:05.364
Why did they
stop talking?

25:05.366 --> 25:08.100
Uh...

25:08.102 --> 25:10.670
Maybe it's because
Lauryn's been in a coma

25:10.672 --> 25:13.072
and hooked up to a ventilator
for a little over a year.

25:13.074 --> 25:14.240
What happened?

25:14.242 --> 25:15.941
Heart attack and brain damage

25:16.043 --> 25:18.477
due to severe hypothermia
and alcohol poisoning.

25:18.479 --> 25:19.912
And where is she now,
Garcia?

25:19.914 --> 25:22.848
Right now she is
hopefully in heaven,

25:22.850 --> 25:25.885
because her sister
like just signed the paperwork

25:25.887 --> 25:27.787
to have her taken off
life support.

25:27.789 --> 25:30.156
Wait, her sister?
What about her parents?

25:30.158 --> 25:32.291
Parent. Susan, single mom,

25:32.293 --> 25:34.527
died of ovarian cancer
7 years ago.

25:34.529 --> 25:36.729
Sheila, her sister,
was 18 at the time,

25:36.731 --> 25:39.165
so she retained custody
of Lauryn.

25:39.167 --> 25:41.200
Oh, bless their hearts.

25:41.202 --> 25:43.769
The medical bills
from the mom and Lauryn

25:43.771 --> 25:45.171
totally bankrupted them.

25:45.173 --> 25:46.639
We need to find Sheila.

25:46.641 --> 25:48.307
Work and home address
just sent.

25:48.952 --> 25:50.652
So this isn't about
what happened to James Linwood.

25:50.654 --> 25:53.288
This about revenge for whatever
happened to Lauryn on that night.

25:53.290 --> 25:55.730
Morgan, you and JJ take the
home address, we'll take the work.

25:56.893 --> 25:58.693
FBI!

26:04.133 --> 26:07.202
JJ: Clear.

26:07.204 --> 26:08.770
It's clear.

26:12.074 --> 26:13.708
Was she moving out?

26:13.710 --> 26:15.210
If her sister's medical bills
bankrupted her,

26:15.212 --> 26:17.145
maybe she's being forced to.

26:19.915 --> 26:21.883
February 16th.

26:21.885 --> 26:24.185
That was the day
of the pig party.

26:24.187 --> 26:26.821
Looks like it's turned
into an obsession.

26:26.823 --> 26:28.323
Or some kind
of investigation.

26:28.325 --> 26:31.359
So she lost her mom,
a few years later she goes bankrupt,

26:31.361 --> 26:33.394
and then she loses
her sister.

26:33.396 --> 26:34.996
Talk about stressors.

26:34.998 --> 26:37.298
Especially since James'
death was the only thing

26:37.300 --> 26:39.067
that made the headlines
from that night.

26:39.069 --> 26:40.535
No one said a thing
about Lauryn.

26:40.537 --> 26:43.705
Maybe no one
actually knows exactly

26:43.707 --> 26:45.173
what happened to her.

26:45.175 --> 26:48.943
Well, she wants answers,
and she thinks the victims have them.

26:52.381 --> 26:54.249
We were drunk.

26:54.251 --> 26:56.384
I can't remember everything.

26:56.386 --> 26:58.353
No?

26:58.355 --> 27:01.389
I'm sorry.

27:03.592 --> 27:05.093
Don't, please.

27:05.095 --> 27:06.728
[Christy whimpering]

27:06.730 --> 27:09.764
Don't, please!

27:09.766 --> 27:11.199
No!

27:11.201 --> 27:13.034
[Screams, moans]

27:13.036 --> 27:17.438
Did that jog your memory,
Mr. Quarterback?

27:18.507 --> 27:22.076
All right, thanks, Hotch.
I'll keep you posted.

27:22.078 --> 27:24.979
Sheila Harrison quit her job
two days ago.

27:24.981 --> 27:26.214
That's strange,

27:26.216 --> 27:28.483
given her dire financial
situation.

27:28.485 --> 27:31.753
Moving out, quitting her job.
She could be close to her end game.

27:31.755 --> 27:33.288
Which is what?

27:35.925 --> 27:38.560
This right here is Dr. Calder,
Mike Smith's friend.

27:38.562 --> 27:39.861
Wait. St. Luke's?

27:39.863 --> 27:43.364
There's a stack of old
medical bills from there.

27:43.366 --> 27:45.072
So Dr. Calder worked
at the same hospital

27:45.097 --> 27:46.769
where Lauryn was treated.

27:46.770 --> 27:48.937
Eyebrows, angel, I love you.
What do you need?

27:48.939 --> 27:51.706
Hey, mama, I need all you
got on a Dr. Edward Calder.

27:51.708 --> 27:54.709
Well, he's been an E.R. doc
at St. Luke's

27:54.711 --> 27:55.810
for the past 15 years.

27:55.812 --> 27:57.212
All right, Garcia,
what was the date

27:57.213 --> 27:59.213
that Lauryn-Anne first
checked into St. Luke's?

27:59.215 --> 28:01.583
February 17, 2013.

28:01.585 --> 28:02.984
The day after
the party.

28:02.986 --> 28:05.119
Was Dr. Calder on duty?
Why, yes, he was.

28:05.121 --> 28:07.088
All right, can you pull up
her chart from that day?

28:07.090 --> 28:09.557
JJ, can I pull up--
is the pope a Catholic?

28:09.559 --> 28:12.694
Uh, minor cuts and bruises,
hypothermia, alcohol poisoning.

28:12.696 --> 28:13.861
We know all this.

28:13.863 --> 28:15.496
Oh, this we do not know.

28:15.498 --> 28:16.931
What?

28:16.933 --> 28:19.467
Apparently she had
some pretty rough sex

28:19.469 --> 28:20.935
that night
with multiple partners.

28:20.937 --> 28:22.937
3, to be exact.

28:22.939 --> 28:24.205
And no raincoats.

28:24.207 --> 28:26.608
They found DNA. Eew!

28:26.610 --> 28:27.942
Maybe she was raped.

28:27.944 --> 28:31.079
Uh-uh. It says in the report
that is was consensual sex.

28:31.081 --> 28:33.715
We're gonna need to talk
to Dr. Calder again.

28:33.717 --> 28:34.882
Thanks, Boo.

28:36.986 --> 28:39.387
Sorry for the wait.

28:39.389 --> 28:41.589
How dare you?

28:41.591 --> 28:44.659
You send the police
to my job.

28:44.661 --> 28:46.894
Well, we wanted
to be sure.

28:46.896 --> 28:48.129
What's this about?

28:48.131 --> 28:50.231
Lauryn-Anne Harrison.

28:50.233 --> 28:51.866
Who's that?

28:51.868 --> 28:54.068
Well, this is your
signature, isn't it?

28:55.037 --> 28:56.571
Yes, it is,
but it's an E.R.

28:56.573 --> 28:58.673
I get lots of cases.

28:58.675 --> 28:59.974
Yeah, but
the funny thing is,

28:59.976 --> 29:03.611
you actually wrote
two reports on her that night.

29:03.613 --> 29:06.314
And I have the original
right here.

29:06.316 --> 29:09.183
You wrote this one 3 hours
before the one you actually filed.

29:09.185 --> 29:10.597
In the earlier report,

29:10.622 --> 29:12.880
you said there was possible
evidence of sexual assault.

29:13.857 --> 29:16.958
But a few hours later,
you changed your mind. Why?

29:16.960 --> 29:20.171
It's a medical opinion.
I'm allowed to change it.

29:20.172 --> 29:21.041
But in the later report,

29:21.066 --> 29:23.131
you neglected to mention
the bruises on her neck.

29:23.366 --> 29:26.367
That's not an opinion.

29:26.369 --> 29:28.469
Look, here's how
it's gonna go, Doc.

29:28.471 --> 29:30.972
You're gonna tell us
everything you know

29:30.974 --> 29:32.974
about what happened
that night.

29:32.976 --> 29:35.677
And if the information
that you give us leads to an arrest,

29:35.679 --> 29:37.512
we might consider
not charging you

29:37.514 --> 29:39.480
with obstruction
of justice.

29:46.555 --> 29:48.823
I only know names,

29:48.825 --> 29:50.625
not details.

29:50.627 --> 29:53.561
Trevor Burkett,
Christopher Stafford,

29:53.563 --> 29:56.064
um...Adam Richmond.

29:56.066 --> 29:57.832
Adam was a football player,

29:57.834 --> 30:01.035
quarterback, team captain.

30:01.037 --> 30:02.637
Mike pressured me
to change the report

30:02.639 --> 30:06.207
so he wouldn't get
kicked off the team.

30:14.116 --> 30:16.684
Know why you're here,
Christopher?

30:16.686 --> 30:20.088
Cops told me I was
under arrest for rape.

30:20.090 --> 30:21.422
[Clears throat]

30:21.424 --> 30:24.292
Lauryn-Anne Harrison.

30:24.294 --> 30:26.694
You recognize her?

30:28.697 --> 30:30.064
[Quietly] Yeah.

30:30.066 --> 30:32.266
Now, we may actually
have enough to convict you

30:32.268 --> 30:33.968
for rape and homicide.

30:33.970 --> 30:35.303
What?

30:35.305 --> 30:36.537
She died today.

30:36.539 --> 30:39.207
From injuries she sustained
the night of the party.

30:39.209 --> 30:40.708
No.

30:40.710 --> 30:42.110
Your friend Trevor
went missing,

30:42.112 --> 30:43.978
and when we found him,

30:43.980 --> 30:46.447
this is what he looked like.
Oh, my God.

30:46.449 --> 30:48.649
The only way to help
yourself, Christopher,

30:48.651 --> 30:51.753
is to tell us exactly
what happened that night.

30:51.755 --> 30:53.020
Right now.

30:57.493 --> 31:00.428
It wasn't my idea.
I swear.

31:00.430 --> 31:04.766
[Screaming]

31:12.207 --> 31:15.042
They took turns.

31:15.044 --> 31:16.844
And what about you?

31:16.846 --> 31:18.279
They made me.

31:18.281 --> 31:19.747
Made you. Did they hold
a gun to your head?

31:19.749 --> 31:22.550
[Sighs]

31:22.552 --> 31:24.852
And then what happened?

31:34.062 --> 31:36.864
When it was over,
Adam forced her

31:36.866 --> 31:38.432
to drink a whole bottle
of vodka.

31:38.434 --> 31:39.667
Drink.

31:39.669 --> 31:41.235
JJ: Why?

31:41.237 --> 31:45.173
To make sure she was
blackout drunk...

31:45.175 --> 31:47.408
No, all of it.
All of it.

31:47.410 --> 31:51.412
And wouldn't remember
anything that happened.

31:57.085 --> 31:59.287
And then what did you do?

32:00.355 --> 32:02.757
We waited for her
to pass out.

32:04.026 --> 32:06.227
And then we got
her address off her phone

32:06.229 --> 32:07.795
and drove her home.

32:07.797 --> 32:10.231
Don't you say it like you did
her a favor and gave her a lift,

32:10.233 --> 32:12.133
you son of a bitch.

32:12.135 --> 32:14.735
I'm so sorry.

32:14.737 --> 32:17.238
You're sorry?

32:17.240 --> 32:19.907
Well, I am, too,
and here we are.

32:19.909 --> 32:23.311
Sorry doesn't change
a damn thing.

32:27.716 --> 32:29.750
You know, she called me
that night

32:29.752 --> 32:32.220
from the driveway.

32:32.222 --> 32:33.855
When I listened
to the message,

32:33.857 --> 32:36.991
she was so drunk,
I could barely understand a word.

32:36.993 --> 32:39.927
She just kept apologizing.

32:40.762 --> 32:42.263
She said your names.

32:42.265 --> 32:43.297
[Christy crying]

32:43.299 --> 32:47.168
So I know you killed her.

32:50.405 --> 32:53.341
And you covered it up.

32:56.378 --> 32:58.012
According to these
financial records,

32:58.014 --> 32:59.201
it looks like Michael Smith

32:59.226 --> 33:01.216
is more than a Mecklenburg
State booster,

33:01.217 --> 33:03.384
he's also kind of shady.

33:03.386 --> 33:04.585
How so?

33:04.587 --> 33:06.187
We'll, he's got a business
account that makes

33:06.189 --> 33:08.856
automatic monthly transfers
to a sporting goods company

33:08.858 --> 33:10.491
called Star-Gear,
and that particular company

33:10.493 --> 33:12.994
supplies the Mecklenburg State
football team with all their equipment.

33:12.996 --> 33:15.596
He also purchased several
cars for the players,

33:15.598 --> 33:18.833
in addition to paying off
their DUI fines and attorney fees.

33:18.835 --> 33:21.135
That explains why he wanted
to rape charges to go away.

33:21.137 --> 33:23.271
Adam Richmond had to be the reason
Smith got involved in the first place.

33:23.273 --> 33:25.539
Calder, the E.R. doc,
knew that Lauryn had been raped,

33:25.541 --> 33:27.341
so he called Michael Smith
and they covered it up.

33:27.343 --> 33:29.510
But how in the world
did Sheila know

33:29.512 --> 33:31.078
who to go after
in the first place?

33:31.080 --> 33:32.647
Her sister must have
told her somehow.

33:32.649 --> 33:33.915
But how?
She was in a coma.

33:33.917 --> 33:35.583
I'll have Garcia go through
the phone records again.

33:35.585 --> 33:36.884
Maybe we missed something.

33:36.886 --> 33:38.252
And since her sister's
dead now,

33:38.254 --> 33:39.921
she may begin to unravel.

33:39.923 --> 33:41.889
Adam Richmond was just
reported missing.

33:41.891 --> 33:43.691
He was supposed to meet
his football coach

33:43.693 --> 33:45.459
and now he's nowhere
to be found.

33:48.297 --> 33:51.032
At first I wanted you
to suffer.

33:51.034 --> 33:54.068
But there's not much point
in that now, is there?

33:54.070 --> 33:55.670
[Grunting]

33:55.672 --> 33:58.839
[Muffled cries]

34:06.249 --> 34:08.813
Sheila probably took her victims
back to where it all started.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.388
Well, isn't the old Beta Sigma Delta
house fully occupied?

34:11.389 --> 34:13.556
Yes. And I just confirmed
that the basement

34:13.558 --> 34:15.091
was converted to a yoga
studio last month.

34:15.092 --> 34:17.326
Symbolism is important
to Sheila, though.

34:17.328 --> 34:18.860
She must be
on or near campus.

34:18.862 --> 34:20.396
She'd want to get as close
as she could to the crime scene.

34:20.398 --> 34:21.731
And she'd need a place
where she could drive in

34:21.733 --> 34:23.199
and unload her victims
but remain unseen.

34:23.201 --> 34:25.835
Garcia, are there any vacant buildings
within a 5-mile radius

34:25.837 --> 34:27.069
of the fraternity house?

34:27.071 --> 34:29.405
Checking now. I've got
a condemned house on Walnut

34:29.407 --> 34:32.574
that's scheduled to be razed
for the new chemistry building,

34:32.577 --> 34:34.076
and there's a dormitory
on the East Hill

34:34.078 --> 34:35.143
that's currently
under renovation.

34:35.146 --> 34:36.746
I'm sending you
both addresses now.

34:36.748 --> 34:39.248
All right, Morgan, you, Dave, and
JJ go to the condemned house.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.016
The rest of us
will take the dorm.

34:42.418 --> 34:44.620
[Breathing hard]

34:44.621 --> 34:46.755
Your turn.

34:46.757 --> 34:50.359
They're all pigs,
but I didn't do anything.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.460
You took her there.

34:52.463 --> 34:54.897
How was I supposed to know
what was gonna happen?

34:54.899 --> 34:56.966
Why did you leave
without her?

34:56.967 --> 34:58.467
She was having
a good time.

34:58.469 --> 35:00.870
I thought she met
someone that she liked.

35:24.061 --> 35:25.328
Rossi.

35:28.765 --> 35:32.101
The truth is, you decided
to save your own skin.

35:32.103 --> 35:34.503
You took off when the cops
showed up, right?

35:34.505 --> 35:36.639
I tried to find her,
but I couldn't.

35:36.641 --> 35:39.875
Well, you must have heard
later that she was in the hospital.

35:39.877 --> 35:42.778
But you never called

35:42.780 --> 35:44.914
or came to visit.

35:44.916 --> 35:47.250
We only had one class
together.

35:47.252 --> 35:50.319
It's not like
we were best friends.

35:50.321 --> 35:52.855
No.

35:52.857 --> 35:55.858
No. No, no!

35:55.860 --> 35:57.560
Morgan:
Sheila Harrison, FBI!

35:57.562 --> 35:59.762
Drop that weapon.
Help me!

35:59.764 --> 36:01.697
You come any closer,
I'll put this right in her neck.

36:01.699 --> 36:03.633
Sheila, we know
what happened to Lauryn.

36:03.635 --> 36:06.002
We promise you that
we will get justice for her.

36:06.004 --> 36:08.604
Where were you when I tried to tell
the cops what they did to my sister?

36:08.606 --> 36:11.607
I know you want retribution,
but this is a mistake.

36:11.609 --> 36:13.376
The mistake
is how they raped her,

36:13.378 --> 36:15.978
and then they threw her outside
like a bag of trash.

36:15.980 --> 36:19.282
You blame yourself
for letting Lauryn go to that party.

36:22.586 --> 36:25.921
She was my responsibility.

36:26.723 --> 36:30.593
When I got home,
there she was...

36:30.595 --> 36:31.560
Lauryn!

36:31.562 --> 36:33.963
Half dead, laying
on the front lawn.

36:33.965 --> 36:36.632
You are not responsible
for what happened,

36:36.634 --> 36:39.802
but you can help us put away
the people who are.

36:42.439 --> 36:44.774
Sheila...

36:46.643 --> 36:49.478
Let her go.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.199
[Christy whimpering]

38:11.862 --> 38:13.429
Mm.

38:14.865 --> 38:17.867
Everything all right?

38:17.869 --> 38:19.201
Yeah.

38:19.203 --> 38:23.005
I notice you've been
a little distracted lately.

38:23.007 --> 38:25.107
Person, place, or thing?

38:28.645 --> 38:30.613
Person.

38:30.615 --> 38:32.281
Oh.

38:32.283 --> 38:34.750
Is it S.D.U. time already?

38:34.752 --> 38:35.918
S.D.--

38:35.920 --> 38:37.420
excuse me?

38:37.422 --> 38:38.554
S.D.U.

38:38.556 --> 38:41.157
She doesn't understand.

38:41.159 --> 38:43.626
Yo, she doesn't
understand our schedule.

38:43.628 --> 38:47.096
Yo, baby girl, she doesn't
understand how hard our job is.

38:47.098 --> 38:48.397
I do not sound like that.

38:48.399 --> 38:52.001
Anyway, S.D.U. usually hits
around the 5- or 6-month mark.

38:52.003 --> 38:53.803
That's where you break up
with a girlfriend,

38:53.805 --> 38:56.038
or more likely, you force her
to break up with you

38:56.040 --> 38:57.406
so you're not the bad guy.

38:57.408 --> 38:59.542
Damn, you don't pull
any punches, do you?

38:59.544 --> 39:01.210
Look, it's really
quite simple.

39:01.212 --> 39:03.879
You either want
a relationship or you don't.

39:03.881 --> 39:06.215
And if you don't,
accept the fact

39:06.217 --> 39:09.418
that you might be alone
forever.

39:11.888 --> 39:14.123
How do you and will
do it?

39:14.125 --> 39:16.659
It's hard.

39:16.661 --> 39:19.528
It takes a lot of effort.

39:19.530 --> 39:22.531
But work is what
makes it work.

39:22.533 --> 39:26.535
I guess this is the part
where you tell me it's worth it.

39:26.537 --> 39:31.173
Look, we're not the only ones
with demanding jobs, Derek.

39:31.175 --> 39:33.709
So you need to ask yourself,

39:33.711 --> 39:36.712
what are you really
afraid of?

39:40.150 --> 39:41.550
You know, I think
I liked you better

39:41.552 --> 39:43.719
when you were
the press liaison.

39:43.721 --> 39:46.055
No, you didn't.

39:52.662 --> 39:55.097
[Distant siren]

40:04.508 --> 40:06.709
Hey.

40:06.711 --> 40:08.244
Hi.

40:08.246 --> 40:11.680
Listen, um...

40:11.682 --> 40:14.316
About the other day...

40:14.318 --> 40:17.019
Look, Derek, um, I don't want
to pressure you into any--

40:17.021 --> 40:19.755
Look, Savannah, I...

40:19.757 --> 40:25.427
I will do whatever
it takes to be with you.

40:27.831 --> 40:31.767
I am in love with you.

40:43.813 --> 40:45.548
I love you, too.

40:45.550 --> 40:46.815
[Sighs]

40:46.817 --> 40:49.418
Ohh...

40:55.425 --> 40:58.761
Ok, so your folks--

40:58.763 --> 41:00.763
are they here yet?

41:00.765 --> 41:04.133
I am actually on my way
to pick them up at the airport.

41:04.135 --> 41:05.134
I'll drive.

41:05.136 --> 41:07.503
Mm...No way.

41:07.505 --> 41:10.005
What? What do you mean?

41:10.941 --> 41:12.775
I've seen your driving.

41:12.777 --> 41:14.777
I'm driving.

41:14.779 --> 41:16.745
Oh, so this is how
it's gonna be?

41:16.747 --> 41:20.282
Yep. Get used to it.
