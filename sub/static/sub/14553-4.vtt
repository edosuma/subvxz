WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:04.402
I feel bad, you know.

00:04.515 --> 00:05.870
I'm like that way
as a father, too.

00:05.983 --> 00:07.879
Like, I have two kids
and I have a responsibility

00:07.992 --> 00:10.982
to stay in shape so I can take
care of 'em, but I don't.

00:11.095 --> 00:14.654
Like, I'm always in
a 48-hour window of diarrhea,

00:14.767 --> 00:16.590
either that I had it

00:16.703 --> 00:18.694
or I'll be having it...

00:18.807 --> 00:22.533
within 48 hours of
any given moment.

00:22.646 --> 00:26.737
There's always
two diarrheas running up...

00:26.850 --> 00:28.404
along the slide of my life

00:28.517 --> 00:31.040
and I'm in somewhere.

00:31.153 --> 00:34.544
And depending on how--
where in that window I am

00:34.657 --> 00:36.812
dictates how much of a radius
from my home

00:36.925 --> 00:38.459
I'm willing to venture.

00:41.132 --> 00:44.224
Otherwise, I'm having
diarrhea in a public restroom

00:44.337 --> 00:46.153
with my kids standing there
watching me,

00:46.266 --> 00:47.266
'cause they're little.

00:47.379 --> 00:49.074
I can't leave 'em
out in a place.

00:53.646 --> 00:58.338
"Daddy, I don't want you
to have diarrhea !"

00:58.451 --> 01:00.072
Sorry, honey,
you want to go to the aquarium,

01:00.185 --> 01:02.620
this is what happens.

01:04.422 --> 01:05.643
I told you,
let's go to the deli

01:05.756 --> 01:07.178
and buy a "Daily News"
and go home,

01:07.291 --> 01:10.981
but you wanted to get all
fancy and go to the aquarium,

01:11.094 --> 01:14.532
so you gotta watch Daddy shit
water out of his asshole.

01:23.144 --> 01:24.633
Hello, Sunshine Deli.

01:24.746 --> 01:26.904
Hi, can I order some
food for delivery?

01:27.017 --> 01:28.372
Okay, what you want?

01:28.485 --> 01:30.474
Uh, can I get some milk, pase?

01:30.587 --> 01:31.709
2%?

01:31.822 --> 01:33.079
No, whole milk.

01:33.192 --> 01:35.081
Yeah, oh-- 2%.

01:35.194 --> 01:36.349
And OJ.

01:36.462 --> 01:37.584
Pulp?
What?

01:37.697 --> 01:38.552
Pulp?

01:38.665 --> 01:39.720
Sorry?

01:39.833 --> 01:41.089
<i>Pulp?</i>

01:41.202 --> 01:43.024
I... I still don't know.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.192
Pulp?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.827
It's just a noise, I'm sorry.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.830
I just-- Can you please--
<i>Pulp?</i>

01:47.950 --> 01:49.483
Is there a word--
Do you have a synonym?

01:49.780 --> 01:51.905
Pulp. You want OJ with pulp
or without pulp?

01:52.025 --> 01:53.025
Oh.

01:53.145 --> 01:54.538
Yeah, no pulp.

01:54.651 --> 01:55.851
One second.

01:58.222 --> 01:58.976
Nah.

01:59.089 --> 02:00.644
Sorry, we don't have.

02:00.757 --> 02:01.879
All right, forget it.

02:01.992 --> 02:03.413
Forget everything or just OJ?

02:03.526 --> 02:04.981
No, just the OJ.

02:05.094 --> 02:06.216
What else you want?

02:06.329 --> 02:07.884
Cream cheese.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.829
The kind with
the pink thing in the--

02:09.942 --> 02:10.942
Yes, I know what kind.

02:11.055 --> 02:12.354
Everybody gets.

02:12.467 --> 02:13.956
Also, do you have apples?

02:14.069 --> 02:15.190
Yes.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.659
And bananas.

02:16.772 --> 02:18.828
How many bananas?

02:18.941 --> 02:19.962
Just a bunch.

02:20.075 --> 02:21.197
How many?

02:21.310 --> 02:22.799
Can you just bring some?

02:22.912 --> 02:24.633
Bananas are loose, my friend.

02:24.746 --> 02:25.768
How many you want?

02:25.881 --> 02:27.036
I don't know, six.

02:27.149 --> 02:28.403
60 bananas.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.238
No, six.
60.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.807
Why are you
hearing extra letters?

02:31.920 --> 02:34.677
Who-- Why would I want--
Who wants 60 bananas?

02:34.790 --> 02:36.612
You want 60 bananas.

02:36.725 --> 02:38.648
No, I don't want 60 bananas.

02:38.761 --> 02:40.451
I...

02:40.564 --> 02:42.787
Just hold on a second, please.

02:42.900 --> 02:43.933
Hello?

02:46.003 --> 02:47.871
Hello, who is this?

02:51.008 --> 02:52.597
Hi, Carleen.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.199
What's the matter?

02:54.312 --> 02:56.468
I just...

02:56.581 --> 02:57.870
I-- I can't--

02:57.983 --> 03:00.874
Okay, just-- Dude, what--
Tell me what happened.

03:00.987 --> 03:03.944
Oh, Louie, I am so sorry

03:04.057 --> 03:06.580
I wasn't a better
big sister to you.

03:06.693 --> 03:08.650
<i>You needed...</i>

03:08.763 --> 03:11.686
someone just to look after you.

03:11.799 --> 03:14.323
It's okay, Carly, just--

03:14.436 --> 03:16.492
You know, maybe go to bed.

03:16.605 --> 03:18.828
It's not fair.

03:18.941 --> 03:20.263
I should have
looked out for you.

03:20.376 --> 03:22.044
You were just little.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.101
I gotta go.

03:25.214 --> 03:26.937
Do you remember,
there was that--

03:27.050 --> 03:30.641
that kid that lived on
the street, Michael?

03:30.754 --> 03:31.909
Michael?

03:32.022 --> 03:33.177
Yeah.

03:33.290 --> 03:36.548
He was really nice to me.

03:36.661 --> 03:39.184
You know, he was just
a really nice guy.

03:39.297 --> 03:43.055
I don't remember him
saying one mean thing.

03:43.168 --> 03:44.523
Do you remember him?

03:44.636 --> 03:46.337
Yes, I remember him.

03:52.445 --> 03:54.734
I-- I gotta go.

03:54.847 --> 03:55.869
Louie.

03:55.982 --> 03:57.904
Please, drink
a big glass of water

03:58.017 --> 03:59.506
and you'll feel better, okay?

03:59.619 --> 04:00.574
Bye.

04:00.687 --> 04:01.687
Louie?

04:06.293 --> 04:08.394
Do not answer.

04:10.497 --> 04:11.798
Just don't answer the phone.

04:22.177 --> 04:23.410
Sunshine Deli.

05:35.950 --> 05:38.873
I don't know who made the rules

05:38.986 --> 05:42.577
for how you're supposed to act
when you meet people.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.945
I don't know why it is
every time I meet somebody,

05:45.058 --> 05:46.847
they turn out to be crazy.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.460
Like, I was in New York
last week and this--

05:54.500 --> 05:57.457
Is anybody listening
to my voice right now?

05:57.570 --> 06:00.661
Is anybody actually paying
attention?

06:00.774 --> 06:02.296
Come on, folks.

06:02.409 --> 06:04.298
Just give me a chance.

06:04.411 --> 06:06.433
I-- I understand
why you're here.

06:06.546 --> 06:08.302
You lost money at the tables

06:08.415 --> 06:10.237
and now they get you
free tickets to this

06:10.350 --> 06:11.572
so that you
wouldn't kill yourself.

06:11.685 --> 06:14.008
Sir, please don't go
gamble more, don't!

06:14.121 --> 06:15.910
Don't do it!

06:16.023 --> 06:17.511
Don't do--
Don't go to the--

06:17.624 --> 06:19.047
Don't play blackjack!

06:19.160 --> 06:20.448
Can we close that door
to the casino?

06:20.561 --> 06:21.816
Is there any way--

06:21.929 --> 06:24.032
Please, can we close that door
to the casino?

06:26.402 --> 06:28.158
Folks, why are you giving
your mon*** to Donald Trump?

06:28.271 --> 06:29.559
Why would you do that?

06:29.672 --> 06:31.327
He's a billionaire
and you--

06:31.440 --> 06:34.164
Come on, you work
hard for your money.

06:34.277 --> 06:37.200
And he has billions of dollars
and you're giving him--

06:37.313 --> 06:38.968
You came here on a shitty bus

06:39.081 --> 06:41.137
to give Donald Trump your 75Â¢.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.438
You give him your money

06:42.551 --> 06:44.707
and all you get is
tickets to this show

06:44.820 --> 06:46.976
and I'm not even funny,
so how is that--

06:47.089 --> 06:49.512
Oh, oh, thank you.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.881
Yeah, thank you.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.851
Now you're united as a people
in hatred of me.

06:54.964 --> 06:57.019
That's nice.

06:57.132 --> 06:58.654
Well, ( bleep ) you people.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.321
How does that sound,
how does that grab you?

07:00.434 --> 07:02.023
No, come on, I'm sorry.

07:02.136 --> 07:03.157
I'm sorry.

07:03.270 --> 07:04.270
I'm really sorry.

07:06.306 --> 07:07.861
It says right here:

07:07.974 --> 07:10.930
"You will not disparage
the casino,

07:11.043 --> 07:13.232
"you will not
make jokes about gambling,

07:13.345 --> 07:15.835
"disparaging gambling,

07:15.948 --> 07:18.837
"you will not disparage
Donald Trump,

07:18.950 --> 07:22.775
"you will not act in a rude
manner toward the audience,

07:22.888 --> 07:24.510
"you will not
use the F-word,

07:24.623 --> 07:26.846
"the N-word or the D-word.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.415
You will not leave the stage--"
Wait, wait, wait, what's-- what's the--

07:29.528 --> 07:30.995
What's the D-word?

07:33.599 --> 07:35.521
I don't know, but you've
used the F-word

07:35.634 --> 07:36.756
and you did all
these other things.

07:36.869 --> 07:38.591
Yeah, but you guys
don't police the room.

07:38.704 --> 07:39.859
You don't do anything
to control it.

07:39.972 --> 07:41.827
People come walking in,
they're talking,

07:41.940 --> 07:43.896
they walk out
in the middle of the show.

07:44.009 --> 07:45.431
You don't even close the door
to the casino.

07:45.544 --> 07:47.300
We can't close the door, see.

07:47.413 --> 07:49.669
We only make money
when they're on the floor.

07:49.782 --> 07:51.871
Every minute they're in your
show, we're not making money.

07:51.984 --> 07:53.940
Well, then why am I even here?

07:54.053 --> 07:57.077
Gives the people
something to do.

07:57.190 --> 07:58.345
You know, you guys have
a nice theater here.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.979
Why don't you
put me in the theater?

08:00.092 --> 08:01.748
I would do great in there.
You don't draw a crowd here.

08:01.861 --> 08:04.284
I do, I draw!

08:04.397 --> 08:06.887
I was just in Chicago,
I sold out 1,200 seats.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.188
Well, that's Chicago.

08:08.301 --> 08:10.357
They got all those people.

08:10.470 --> 08:13.093
You're a comic's-comic type.

08:13.206 --> 08:14.994
They come out for you.

08:15.107 --> 08:17.509
Here, that's not worth a thing.

08:18.544 --> 08:20.299
Look...

08:20.412 --> 08:22.168
you're a nice guy.

08:22.281 --> 08:24.670
I'm not into being punitive.

08:24.783 --> 08:26.238
But I need you to promise me

08:26.351 --> 08:28.339
that you won't break
any of these rules,

08:28.452 --> 08:31.508
or I'm gonna have to fire you.

08:31.621 --> 08:33.310
Well, you know what,
you better fire me.

08:33.423 --> 08:34.478
'Cause I can't
get through the weekend

08:34.591 --> 08:37.415
if I can't say how much
I hate it.

08:37.528 --> 08:39.150
All right.

08:39.263 --> 08:40.485
I'll put in your release.

08:40.598 --> 08:41.752
Keep the room tonight,
you go home tomorrow.

08:41.865 --> 08:44.155
All right, thank you.

08:44.268 --> 08:46.424
I don't know why

08:46.537 --> 08:48.359
you just don't want to
keep your mouth shut

08:48.472 --> 08:49.639
and keep the money.

08:52.209 --> 08:53.710
I don't know, either.

09:41.541 --> 09:42.863
... do a nude picture
and she wouldn't do it,

09:42.976 --> 09:46.128
and she should do it
because women's breasts drop.

09:46.241 --> 09:48.699
Women's bodies drop,
goddamn it.

09:49.219 --> 09:50.052
It's-- it's so unfair.

09:50.165 --> 09:52.254
Oh, oh, wait, just you wait.

09:52.367 --> 09:54.602
Without a brassiere, this is how
I go to the bathroom at night.

09:58.707 --> 10:01.097
Without a brassiere, I could
nurse China from the bedroom.

10:01.210 --> 10:03.166
You have no idea.

10:03.279 --> 10:04.634
Everything-- My ass--

10:04.747 --> 10:06.903
I thought a stagehand
pinched me, he stepped on it.

10:07.016 --> 10:08.839
Everything...

10:08.952 --> 10:11.075
And vaginas drop.

10:11.188 --> 10:12.777
Vaginas drop, yes.

10:12.890 --> 10:14.178
Yes, I had no idea.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.579
I woke up
six years ago, I said,

10:15.692 --> 10:17.648
"Why am I wearing
a bunny slipper ?"

10:17.761 --> 10:18.761
And...

10:23.033 --> 10:25.667
And why is it gray?

10:27.970 --> 10:29.858
Vagin--
And no one tells you.

10:29.971 --> 10:31.493
If my mother had said to me,

10:31.606 --> 10:33.028
"Joan, your vagina's
gonna drop,"

10:33.141 --> 10:34.596
I would have said, "Great."

10:34.709 --> 10:36.532
If she'd have said,
"Joan, when you get older,

10:36.645 --> 10:37.766
"your vagina's gonna drop,

10:37.879 --> 10:39.134
"but this is a good thing,

10:39.247 --> 10:40.936
"because you can still have sex
in the bedroom

10:41.049 --> 10:42.204
and watch TV
in the living room,"

10:42.317 --> 10:43.451
I would have gone, "Okay."

10:45.087 --> 10:47.510
Well, men's bodies drop,
too, so ha-ha-ha.

10:47.623 --> 10:49.212
You put a man over 50--
I'm gonna show you.

10:49.325 --> 10:50.346
Who's over 50 here?

10:50.459 --> 10:51.481
I'm gonna show you.

10:51.594 --> 10:53.917
I am gonna show you.

10:54.030 --> 10:56.386
Their balls-- You sit a man
over 50 on the toilet,

10:56.499 --> 10:58.454
it looks like he's
making a cup of tea.

10:58.567 --> 10:59.867
And-- Yes!

11:12.414 --> 11:13.735
Will you sign this for me?
Absolutely.

11:13.848 --> 11:15.403
Thanks so much.

11:15.836 --> 11:17.625
You're very funny.
Thank you.

11:17.738 --> 11:19.494
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

11:19.607 --> 11:20.828
Thank you very, very much.

11:21.308 --> 11:22.997
Okay.

11:23.110 --> 11:23.671
Hi.
Hello.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.699
Can I get a picture?
Abso-- Sure, of course.

11:25.812 --> 11:26.812
Do you want to be in it?

11:26.925 --> 11:28.474
Do you want to take it for us?

11:28.587 --> 11:30.076
Here, come on in, be in it,
be in it.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.243
That's the whole point.

11:31.356 --> 11:32.445
Here we go.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.080
Smile.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.281
Good.

11:35.394 --> 11:37.049
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.880
Pleasure, thank you,
no problem.

11:38.993 --> 11:40.058
Do you have any Purell?

11:40.171 --> 11:41.171
Yes, ma'am.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.684
Hey, Joan.
Hi.

11:42.797 --> 11:44.886
Hi, my name's Louie,
I'm a comic.

11:44.999 --> 11:47.288
Yeah, I know, I know, I've
seen you, you're very funny.

11:47.401 --> 11:48.656
Oh, thanks.
I saw you on cable.

11:48.769 --> 11:49.824
Thank you.

11:49.937 --> 11:51.293
Well, I saw--
I'm playing the lounge here

11:51.406 --> 11:53.495
and I saw your show
and I'm-- I just--

11:53.608 --> 11:55.331
It's-- You were
so good tonight and--

11:55.444 --> 11:56.599
Thank you.

11:56.712 --> 11:58.501
It's nice hearing that
from young comics.

11:58.614 --> 12:00.303
And even somebody your age.
I just want you to know, I think you're great.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.205
- I just have-- always have
thought you were great. - Thank you.

12:02.318 --> 12:03.640
Good, so...

12:03.753 --> 12:05.008
It was nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

12:05.121 --> 12:06.404
Okay.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.517
You want to hang out?

12:07.630 --> 12:09.681
You want to talk, gossip?

12:09.794 --> 12:10.848
Got any good gossip?

12:10.961 --> 12:12.784
Shop?
I would love that.

12:12.897 --> 12:14.352
Good, all right.
That would be great.

12:14.465 --> 12:16.854
You know what, meet me upstairs
in my suite, if you would.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.656
'Cause I don't like to
drink in front of everybody.

12:18.769 --> 12:19.824
Sure.
Okay?

12:19.937 --> 12:20.758
Come have a drink
and we'll talk.

12:20.871 --> 12:21.903
Okay, thanks.
Great.

12:22.016 --> 12:23.016
Great.

12:23.129 --> 12:24.362
What's...
her room number?

12:24.475 --> 12:25.576
Gonna be in room 3-A.
Okay.

12:31.916 --> 12:33.818
Coming, coming.

12:37.322 --> 12:38.877
Good, you found it.
Hi.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.746
Hi, nice to see you.

12:40.859 --> 12:42.548
Go on in.
Okay.

12:42.661 --> 12:44.083
Wow.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.684
Yeah, it's nice, huh?
Yeah.

12:45.797 --> 12:47.419
Cher had this place,
she slept here.

12:47.532 --> 12:49.388
Madonna, Bette Midler.

12:49.501 --> 12:51.657
And believe me, I know, 'cause
they don't change the sheets.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.125
Sit down.

12:53.238 --> 12:54.426
Okay.

12:54.539 --> 12:55.661
Would you like
something to drink?

12:55.774 --> 12:56.862
Yeah, whatever you're having.

12:56.975 --> 12:58.030
Okay.

12:58.143 --> 12:59.198
I'm always-- I always have
a little vodka,

12:59.311 --> 13:00.099
if you don't mind.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.400
Sure.

13:01.513 --> 13:02.680
Tell me when.

13:04.249 --> 13:06.873
That's-- Right there's good.
Good.

13:06.986 --> 13:07.986
And...

13:10.288 --> 13:12.411
Okay.

13:12.524 --> 13:13.925
And...

13:17.243 --> 13:18.332
To comedy.

13:18.445 --> 13:19.599
Thank you very much.

13:19.712 --> 13:21.168
So...

13:21.281 --> 13:22.903
you're in the lounge.

13:23.016 --> 13:24.505
I was.

13:24.618 --> 13:26.040
You were fired?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.242
I quit.

13:28.355 --> 13:29.510
What do you mean you quit?

13:29.623 --> 13:31.913
Nobody quits.
I quit.

13:32.026 --> 13:34.048
Are you crazy?

13:34.161 --> 13:36.184
Are you a trust-fund baby
that you quit?

13:36.297 --> 13:38.452
No, it's just
that they got upset

13:38.565 --> 13:40.321
'cause I was saying stuff
about the casino

13:40.434 --> 13:41.889
and I was making
fun of Trump and...

13:42.002 --> 13:44.324
You're in a Trump hotel.

13:44.437 --> 13:46.393
You don't make fun of
the owner of the hotel.

13:46.506 --> 13:47.928
Are you crazy?

13:48.041 --> 13:49.663
He's not gonna hire a comedian
that's gonna say,

13:49.776 --> 13:51.631
"Donald Trump."

13:51.744 --> 13:53.200
I know, but I-- I--

13:53.313 --> 13:55.970
Y'know, this is not
an easy business.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.040
I mean, you want to
try my life sometimes?

13:59.153 --> 14:01.542
I work in Arizona,
how about that?

14:01.655 --> 14:03.979
An Indian casinos,
you think that's easy?

14:04.092 --> 14:05.347
You tell a joke,
they don't like it,

14:05.460 --> 14:07.550
instead of a tomato,
they throw a tomahawk?

14:07.663 --> 14:08.984
What do you expect?

14:09.097 --> 14:10.119
I mean, you got a job.

14:10.232 --> 14:12.188
How lucky are you,
for goodness sakes?

14:12.301 --> 14:13.322
Yeah, but come on.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.890
You're in the nice
theater here.

14:15.003 --> 14:16.459
They got me in
the shitty lounge.

14:16.572 --> 14:20.162
I was in the shitty lounge,
sweetie puss, two years ago.

14:20.275 --> 14:22.263
For all I know, I'll be
back in the shitty lounge

14:22.376 --> 14:23.565
two years from now

14:23.678 --> 14:24.943
and you'll be in the main room.

14:25.056 --> 14:26.056
Things change.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.802
That's the business.

14:27.915 --> 14:29.270
Look at the perks
you're getting.

14:29.383 --> 14:31.372
You've got a job.

14:31.485 --> 14:33.574
You got a card
for the free food

14:33.687 --> 14:35.810
in the employee cafeteria.

14:35.923 --> 14:37.846
I mean, stop bitching
and go buy yourself

14:37.959 --> 14:40.182
a pocketbook that's
lined in plastic

14:40.295 --> 14:42.085
and throw food in
when they're not looking.

14:42.198 --> 14:43.553
Yeah, great.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.488
You know what's
wrong with you guys?

14:45.601 --> 14:47.691
You don't know when
you're lucky.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.561
Appreciate where you are,
for God's sakes.

14:50.674 --> 14:53.064
It goes up, it goes down.

14:53.177 --> 14:55.800
I thought I had
the lock on old.

14:55.913 --> 14:57.234
Lock on old.

14:57.347 --> 14:58.602
And then guess what?

14:58.715 --> 15:00.905
Back from the dead,
Betty White.

15:01.018 --> 15:03.975
Dusted off her old dumb tits
and trotted 'em out.

15:04.088 --> 15:05.610
It could happen to you.

15:05.723 --> 15:06.911
You think you're doing so well

15:07.024 --> 15:08.045
insulting what's-his-name,

15:08.158 --> 15:10.614
"Dane Clark" guy, that asshole?

15:10.727 --> 15:13.483
He can come out
and take a job from you.

15:13.596 --> 15:15.312
Know when you're lucky.

15:15.425 --> 15:16.425
Yeah, I know.

15:16.538 --> 15:17.822
I mean, I know all that.

15:17.935 --> 15:20.191
It's just that sometimes
I get sick of the bullshit.

15:20.304 --> 15:22.094
Sick of the bullshit?

15:22.207 --> 15:24.363
What is your problem?

15:24.476 --> 15:26.332
I am a million years old.

15:26.445 --> 15:27.700
Do you know
what I've been through?

15:27.813 --> 15:29.635
I've been in this business for
a million and two years

15:29.748 --> 15:31.270
and I'm a woman.

15:31.383 --> 15:32.438
I'm a woman!

15:32.551 --> 15:34.006
It's not easy to--

15:34.119 --> 15:36.242
Do you know how many
blow jobs I had to give

15:36.355 --> 15:37.876
to get where I am now?

15:37.989 --> 15:39.778
Come on, give me-- give me
a number, give me a number.

15:39.891 --> 15:42.581
How many blow jobs did it
take for Joan Rivers

15:42.694 --> 15:44.683
to end up in a suite
with lots of flowers?

15:44.796 --> 15:47.119
I don't want to guess that.
Guess, come on.

15:47.232 --> 15:49.288
To go from clubs to
Carson and Carson to Fox

15:49.401 --> 15:51.990
and my own show on daytime,
an Emmy,

15:52.103 --> 15:53.859
and then the red carpet.

15:53.972 --> 15:55.794
Give me a number, give me a--
I don't want to guess.

15:55.907 --> 15:58.063
And then with Melissa, now I
have my own show with Melissa.

15:58.176 --> 16:00.165
Give me a number--
guess, guess, come on.

16:00.278 --> 16:01.766
Give me a number, guess, guess,
guess, guess, guess.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.213
I want to hear a number.

16:04.649 --> 16:06.738
40?

16:06.851 --> 16:09.640
Excuse me?

16:09.753 --> 16:11.609
Around 40?

16:11.722 --> 16:12.810
What the...

16:12.923 --> 16:14.178
How ( bleep ) dare you?

16:14.291 --> 16:16.147
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I have never--

16:16.260 --> 16:17.548
What are you talking about ?!

16:17.661 --> 16:18.983
I'm sorry!
I haven't given any!

16:19.096 --> 16:20.551
None!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

16:20.664 --> 16:21.452
None-- Oh, don't you be sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

16:21.565 --> 16:22.687
I don't do blow jobs!

16:22.800 --> 16:23.487
I got here on--

16:23.600 --> 16:25.022
Smell my breath!

16:25.135 --> 16:27.358
I don't do blow jobs!
Okay, I'm sorry!

16:27.471 --> 16:29.126
That's not what gets you
places in this business,

16:29.239 --> 16:31.529
for God's sakes.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.297
God ! I thought you were
saying it was a lot.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.664
I'm sorry.

16:34.777 --> 16:37.300
Don't talk to me anymore for
a second, for God's sake.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.768
I'm sorry.

16:38.881 --> 16:39.702
Listen.

16:39.815 --> 16:40.870
I'm a mother.

16:40.983 --> 16:42.738
Are you a mother?

16:42.851 --> 16:44.040
No, I'm not a mother.

16:44.153 --> 16:45.708
Yeah, well, I thought you were,
the way you whine

16:45.821 --> 16:47.543
like an old bitch
with fat twins.

16:47.656 --> 16:48.945
That's what you whine like.

16:49.058 --> 16:50.112
My God.

16:50.225 --> 16:51.681
You listen to me.

16:51.794 --> 16:53.550
I have done it all.

16:53.663 --> 16:54.851
I've done it all.

16:54.964 --> 16:57.253
And the only
thing I've learned,

16:57.366 --> 16:59.122
the only thing I've learned is,

16:59.235 --> 17:00.990
you don't quit.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.525
You don't quit.

17:02.638 --> 17:03.960
You have a job,
for God's sakes.

17:04.073 --> 17:06.174
You don't quit a job.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.833
You're right.
Of course I'm right.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.468
Listen, you'll be fine.

17:11.581 --> 17:13.270
You'll be absolutely fine.

17:13.383 --> 17:15.639
Tomorrow morning,
you just go downstairs

17:15.752 --> 17:17.541
and you go tell Sam--

17:17.654 --> 17:19.576
it is still Sam, right?

17:19.689 --> 17:21.911
I don't--
I don't remember his name.

17:22.024 --> 17:23.646
What do you mean you don't
remember his name?

17:23.759 --> 17:26.349
You work for the guy,
you gotta know the guy's name.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.752
How can you work for someone
and not know their name?

17:29.865 --> 17:31.821
You think you only
meet these people once?

17:31.934 --> 17:34.824
You gotta learn their names,
for God's sakes.

17:34.937 --> 17:36.493
You learn their
names on the way up

17:36.606 --> 17:37.794
so when you need their help
on the way down,

17:37.907 --> 17:39.072
you have the name.

17:39.185 --> 17:40.186
His name is Sam.

17:40.299 --> 17:41.532
I think his name is Sam.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.702
His name is Sam
and he is a person.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.638
Tomorrow morning,
you go down there

17:46.751 --> 17:50.476
and you say, "Sam, I'm sorry,
I was wrong."

17:50.589 --> 17:52.277
That's important.

17:52.390 --> 17:54.780
"I want my job back."

17:54.893 --> 17:56.949
Okay, all right.

17:57.062 --> 17:59.185
Listen.

17:59.298 --> 18:00.887
I wish I could
tell you it gets better,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.691
but... it doesn't
get better.

18:04.804 --> 18:07.260
You get better.

18:07.373 --> 18:08.895
Think it's been easy?

18:09.008 --> 18:10.964
I've gone up, I've gone down,

18:11.077 --> 18:14.501
I've been bankrupt,
I've been broke.

18:14.614 --> 18:20.075
But you do it,
and you do it because...

18:20.188 --> 18:24.012
because we love it more
than anything else.

18:24.125 --> 18:26.048
That's why you're doing it.

18:26.161 --> 18:28.417
If you want a real job, honey,

18:28.530 --> 18:30.719
there are a million
things you can do,

18:30.832 --> 18:34.423
but what we do is not a job.

18:34.536 --> 18:37.159
Sounds so stupid.

18:37.272 --> 18:40.729
What we do...

18:40.842 --> 18:44.032
is a calling, my dear.

18:44.145 --> 18:47.168
We make people happy.

18:47.281 --> 18:48.748
It's a calling.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.309
What-- What the--
What are you doing--

18:55.422 --> 18:56.910
Are you craz--
Are you craz--

18:57.023 --> 18:59.046
Get away from me, you stupid ass!
I'm sorry!

18:59.159 --> 19:00.615
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Sorry?

19:00.728 --> 19:02.159
Sorry-- I'm older
than your grandmother!

19:02.272 --> 19:03.273
What, are you crazy?

19:03.386 --> 19:05.320
I got--
I just got carried away.

19:05.433 --> 19:06.788
God almighty!

19:06.901 --> 19:08.490
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.

19:08.603 --> 19:10.793
It's all right, it's okay,
it's all right, fine.

19:10.906 --> 19:11.940
Okay.

19:14.143 --> 19:15.443
It's all right, it's accepted.

19:25.052 --> 19:26.206
What the hell.

19:26.319 --> 19:27.386
Come on.

19:29.322 --> 19:31.144
But don't you dare tell anybody.
No, no.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.080
I mean, it's for your sake,
not for mine.

19:33.193 --> 19:35.282
Nobody likes necrophiliacs, okay?
All right.

19:35.395 --> 19:37.518
And if you meet Melissa,
nothing.

19:37.631 --> 19:39.187
She still thinks I'm a virgin.

19:39.300 --> 19:42.657
I swear, she thinks she popped
out of me one Easter.

19:42.770 --> 19:45.628
Oh, and...
no staying over.

19:45.741 --> 19:47.663
That's fine.

19:47.776 --> 19:48.808
Fine?

19:48.921 --> 19:49.922
No, I just mean I--

19:50.035 --> 19:51.346
Yeah, fine, whatever.
Okay.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.114
Hey, Sam!
