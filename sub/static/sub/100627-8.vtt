00:25.750 --> 00:26.750
How do I look?

00:31.833 --> 00:33.000
Powerful.

00:34.416 --> 00:35.250
Beautiful.

00:39.333 --> 00:40.250
Martín...

00:40.875 --> 00:44.458
for years,
you've been going around in circles...

00:46.041 --> 00:47.291
feeling this way.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.625
I think it's time you moved on.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.666
We can move on to wine, if you like.

00:56.583 --> 00:58.250
-Shall we have a glass?
-No.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.333
I'm not drinking that with you.

01:01.791 --> 01:04.000
I'm going to dinner. With Tatiana.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.625
-Right.
-You'll think about me,

01:07.916 --> 01:08.750
but...

01:09.958 --> 01:11.375
I won't think about you.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.083
You don't have to spell it out for me.
It's clear.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.416
Oh, please. Do you think I don't love you?

01:22.500 --> 01:25.000
I also feel that what we have between us

01:25.083 --> 01:27.500
is extraordinary, unique, wonderful.

01:28.916 --> 01:31.166
I know about love.
I've been married 5 times.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.041
-OK.
-What I've never told you is that...

01:35.166 --> 01:38.000
I've never felt anything
with any of those women

01:38.500 --> 01:41.041
remotely similar to what I have with you.

01:42.208 --> 01:43.375
Not even close.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.125
You and I are soul mates.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.791
But only 99%.

01:52.083 --> 01:55.833
As you know, I really like women.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.833
And you like me too much.

02:02.875 --> 02:06.250
And what's 1% against 99%?

02:08.708 --> 02:13.541
-Unless you're not brave enough to try it.
-That 1% is a tiny mitochondrion...

02:15.333 --> 02:16.916
but it defines my desire.

02:17.916 --> 02:19.041
Mitochondrion.

02:25.791 --> 02:27.208
Where's your desire?

02:33.333 --> 02:34.166
Here?

02:38.333 --> 02:39.291
Where is it?

02:41.583 --> 02:43.541
Don't worry. Relax.

02:44.958 --> 02:45.958
Don't be afraid.

02:55.541 --> 02:57.750
You're a coward, huh?

02:59.166 --> 03:00.125
Where is it?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.166
Look...

03:31.416 --> 03:35.208
I'd give anything to feel that, but...

03:41.375 --> 03:42.666
it's impossible.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.208
It's impossible.

03:54.125 --> 03:55.500
I love you, Martín.

03:56.458 --> 03:59.416
But my brother is right.
We must part ways.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.250
And we have to scrap the plan.

04:04.125 --> 04:07.041
Your son-of-a-bitch brother
told you I loved you

04:07.125 --> 04:08.500
to break up this house.

04:08.583 --> 04:12.500
You're going to go and make photocopies
in the Royal Mint, right?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.791
I suggested melting gold together.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.458
You're hooked on something
that will never exist!

04:24.833 --> 04:26.833
I have to leave you. It's...

04:27.750 --> 04:28.625
for love.

04:31.916 --> 04:33.208
For brotherhood.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.875
For the commitment I have to you.

04:39.708 --> 04:40.916
Leave...

04:41.791 --> 04:43.125
and heal the wound.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.666
Sometimes distance
is the only way to find peace.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.458
Farewell, my friend.

04:52.291 --> 04:56.833
I'm sure that one way or another,
time will bring us back together.

05:21.541 --> 05:24.333
<i>As Alicia Sierra</i>
<i>walked towards the slaughterhouse...</i>

05:26.208 --> 05:28.791
<i>she wore an enigmatic smile</i>
<i>that no one noticed.</i>

05:31.250 --> 05:35.125
<i>It was not the smile</i>
<i>of someone about to throw in the towel.</i>

05:39.500 --> 05:40.791
Please, over here.

05:40.875 --> 05:44.833
Is it true you sent for the daughter
of Ágata Jiménez, Nairobi,

05:44.916 --> 05:47.875
so she'd go to the window
and you could shoot her?

05:47.958 --> 05:50.916
<i>-Did she die from that shot?</i>
-<i>That is untrue.</i>

05:53.791 --> 05:55.583
It was a boy, not a girl.

05:56.166 --> 05:57.291
Nine years old.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.333
And yes, I sent for him.

05:59.416 --> 06:02.791
<i>With the knowledge of my superiors,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

06:02.875 --> 06:05.541
-What are you doing?
<i>-We shot her in the chest.</i>

06:06.250 --> 06:09.000
I didn't allow a doctor to go in
to operate.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.041
Antoñanzas, turn the volume up!

06:11.416 --> 06:13.833
<i>Her friends saved her. All for nothing.</i>

06:14.500 --> 06:18.083
<i>She was killed</i>
<i>by the Bank of Spain's head of security,</i>

06:18.166 --> 06:21.041
Gandía,
with the backing of Colonel Tamayo.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.666
-Fucking bitch.
-<i>It needs to be said.</i>

06:24.541 --> 06:25.875
More questions.

06:25.958 --> 06:28.291
<i>Is it true that this Osman--</i>

06:28.375 --> 06:30.291
I don't know if you know him--

06:30.375 --> 06:31.833
buried Cortés alive?

06:31.916 --> 06:34.291
Yes, we buried him alive.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.583
<i>In Timimoun...</i>

06:35.666 --> 06:37.791
<i>Tamayo's world was falling apart.</i>

06:37.875 --> 06:40.375
<i>Of course I know Osman.</i>
<i>He's a professional.</i>

06:41.666 --> 06:43.958
<i>Capable of burying a man alive...</i>

06:44.041 --> 06:46.875
<i>and leaving him shaking like a leaf</i>
<i>without him dying.</i>

06:47.416 --> 06:51.625
<i>His public image was crumbling,</i>
<i>and the worst was yet to come.</i>

06:52.000 --> 06:55.291
<i>Inside the bank,</i>
<i>his big gamble was unconscious.</i>

06:55.375 --> 06:56.208
Palermo.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.750
-<i>How is he?</i>
-We're operating.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.791
<i>On a stretcher and badly wounded.</i>

07:04.000 --> 07:05.875
Save his life.

07:07.541 --> 07:09.458
Didn't you drug him?

07:09.791 --> 07:12.416
Drugs? We drugged him.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.708
Inhaled, to be precise.

07:13.791 --> 07:17.458
<i>We hung him up, threw cold water on him,</i>
<i>and he shat himself.</i>

07:17.541 --> 07:21.166
Everything the boy said
is absolutely and totally true.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.500
And there are plenty of things
that he forgot to say.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.541
Was the government aware of this?

07:27.583 --> 07:28.416
Aware?

07:30.291 --> 07:32.333
The government gave the orders.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.416
I didn't wake up one day and say,
"I'll interrogate the boy hard."

07:37.500 --> 07:39.375
No! I had everyone's backing.

07:39.458 --> 07:43.625
The CNI, police commanders,
and the Ministry of the Interior.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.583
Absolutely everyone knew about it.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.416
And now you know. Thank you very much.

07:51.625 --> 07:54.416
<i>Alicia Sierra,</i>
<i>negotiator at the Bank of Spain,</i>

07:54.500 --> 07:57.041
<i>reveals all, and nobody is spared.</i>

07:57.125 --> 08:00.375
<i>She admits to torture</i>
<i>but holds the government responsible.</i>

08:00.875 --> 08:05.250
<i>The government gave the orders,</i>
<i>and she says, "Everyone knew."</i>

08:05.333 --> 08:08.041
We have to bury that bitch.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.625
<i>While all of Spain was glued to the TV,</i>

09:35.708 --> 09:38.666
<i>in a former Chinese restaurant</i>
<i>in Madrid,</i>

09:38.750 --> 09:40.666
<i>Benjamín and his men...</i>

09:41.625 --> 09:43.458
<i>were raising hell.</i>

09:45.916 --> 09:46.750
Marseille.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.833
Arriving at extraction point.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.250
Received.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.666
One, two, three.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.833
<i>How many meters?</i>

10:19.375 --> 10:20.500
Four meters.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.666
I need you to work faster.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.166
Lisbon will be guarded by 26 officers,
split between seven vehicles.

10:37.458 --> 10:38.416
Three behind...

10:39.333 --> 10:40.750
and three in front.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.666
In the middle, the van she'll be in.

10:45.083 --> 10:48.708
<i>They'll go to the National Court first</i>
<i>and then to the prison.</i>

10:48.791 --> 10:51.750
What's the most vulnerable point?

10:51.833 --> 10:54.625
On the road. From point A to B.

10:54.708 --> 10:57.333
-No.
-In the courtroom?

10:57.916 --> 10:58.750
No.

10:58.833 --> 11:01.583
-Are we going to tunnel into the prison?
-No.

11:01.666 --> 11:05.416
But there is a place that is vulnerable.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.083
We've all seen it.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.916
<i>On TV.</i>

11:10.125 --> 11:14.875
<i>When the National Court's entrance is</i>
<i>full of journalists, what do the cops do?</i>

11:15.166 --> 11:17.750
<i>They take the prisoner...</i>

11:19.291 --> 11:20.791
through the parking garage.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.666
<i>Only the van goes in.</i>

11:29.458 --> 11:33.666
In 30 seconds, that armored convoy
goes from having 26 officers...

11:34.291 --> 11:37.166
<i>to six. And from seven vehicles...</i>

11:40.916 --> 11:41.833
to one.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.416
POLICE

11:47.500 --> 11:51.208
And a parking garage is not a bunker
or a high-security prison.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.166
-It's...
-A parking garage.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.458
Exactly.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.166
<i>From the National Court parking garage</i>

12:07.250 --> 12:09.958
to the basement of our restaurant,

12:10.291 --> 12:11.791
there are exactly...

12:12.541 --> 12:16.041
11 meters and 68 centimeters of sandstone.

12:16.625 --> 12:19.166
Sandstone. You are Asturian miners.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.833
-The best.
-What's that to you?

12:20.916 --> 12:22.458
Nothing. Pick, shovel, grinder.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.875
<i>Minimum noise, maximum efficiency.</i>

12:30.958 --> 12:33.333
<i>Ten hours, Benjamín, to have it ready.</i>

12:33.416 --> 12:36.500
-And the extraction?
-Silent industrial machinery.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.291
<i>We'll take the rubble to the kitchen.</i>

12:44.000 --> 12:46.791
<i>It'll be a clean and quick operation.</i>

12:56.416 --> 12:57.500
<i>Benjamín?</i>

12:58.875 --> 12:59.875
Five meters.

13:03.125 --> 13:03.958
Palermo.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.250
I'm listening, Professor.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.041
<i>How is he?</i>

13:13.125 --> 13:14.541
He's conscious.

13:14.958 --> 13:16.791
<i>General physical condition?</i>

13:18.791 --> 13:23.291
He can't move one arm.<i> </i>He's lost blood.
He can hardly breathe.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.583
<i>He's a total wreck.</i>

13:24.791 --> 13:26.083
But will he recover?

13:26.166 --> 13:28.875
If I were his mother,
I'd be lighting candles.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.708
I'm telling you that he'll recover.

13:31.791 --> 13:33.833
I'll make sure of it personally.

13:33.916 --> 13:36.833
<i>Even if I have to be with him</i>
<i>for six months.</i>

13:37.541 --> 13:39.125
But I'll make you better.

13:41.041 --> 13:45.333
I'll feed you soup.
I'll make you strong again.

13:45.416 --> 13:49.333
And when you're as strong as an ox,
do you know what will happen?

13:50.791 --> 13:52.125
I'll kill you.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.458
I'll beat you to death.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.541
Why the fuck are we saving
this motherfucker's life?

13:59.625 --> 14:02.416
-<i>Can he speak?</i>
<i>-</i>So far, he's not saying much.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.125
My name is Stockholm. Do you remember me?

14:06.958 --> 14:09.916
Let go of me, fucking bitch, scumbag.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.833
Let go.

14:15.708 --> 14:17.625
Professor, he can talk.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.416
He killed Nairobi.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
What the fuck are we doing?

14:21.583 --> 14:24.500
<i>-We have to kill him!</i>
-That'll depend on him, Rio.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.000
If he wants to live, he'll live.

14:28.791 --> 14:30.041
If he wants to die...

14:31.166 --> 14:32.000
<i>he'll die.</i>

14:33.416 --> 14:34.791
It depends on him?

14:36.541 --> 14:37.958
You can't say that.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.833
<i>You have no clue</i>
<i>how we're feeling in here.</i>

14:40.916 --> 14:43.833
You don't know what it's like
to look him in the eyes.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.875
-Tokyo...
<i>-Don't talk to me like you're my dad.</i>

14:47.416 --> 14:49.208
Do you know how I feel?

14:50.875 --> 14:53.208
Do you know how Helsinki feels?

14:54.250 --> 14:57.708
Helsinki... is stitching him up.

14:58.625 --> 15:02.958
<i>He's treating him.</i>
<i>Do you know who he treated before? No.</i>

15:03.041 --> 15:05.291
You don't know. Of course you don't.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.833
You don't know anything.
You're hiding like a rat.

15:08.916 --> 15:11.833
That's how you keep giving orders
after Nairobi's death,

15:11.916 --> 15:16.708
without shedding a tear.
You feel nothing!

15:16.791 --> 15:18.416
Enough!

15:18.500 --> 15:19.958
You feel nothing!

15:20.041 --> 15:21.000
Stop.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.208
-Nothing!
-Stop!

15:26.791 --> 15:28.833
Do you want to feed him soup too?

15:30.458 --> 15:32.000
Tokyo, I would take him

15:32.416 --> 15:35.208
and I'd stick a burning iron through him.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.750
I'd take him down to the foundry,

15:38.166 --> 15:41.166
and I'd put his head in the furnace
to finish him off.

15:42.958 --> 15:47.125
You think I'm not hurting over Nairobi?
That the Professor isn't too?

15:47.208 --> 15:48.541
Doesn't seem like it.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.416
<i>He's a prisoner.</i>

15:51.500 --> 15:53.791
And we don't kill prisoners.

15:53.875 --> 15:57.166
As much as it pains us,
we don't kill prisoners.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.000
Nor do we kill in cold blood.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.875
But he did!

16:00.958 --> 16:05.583
He killed Nairobi! She was sick.
She was unarmed. She'd surrendered!

16:06.750 --> 16:08.916
We had a truce, for fuck's sake!

16:10.166 --> 16:13.500
Now it's about saving our lives, Rio,
like we saved yours.

16:13.583 --> 16:17.375
<i>That involves collateral damage,</i>
<i>like swallowing the pain.</i>

16:17.791 --> 16:20.416
<i>We've run out of time.</i>
<i>They broke the truce.</i>

16:20.500 --> 16:22.750
<i>We have to turn this situation around.</i>

16:23.958 --> 16:24.833
Helsinki.

16:25.333 --> 16:26.291
Helsinki!

16:27.541 --> 16:28.416
Helsinki, no!

16:30.083 --> 16:33.083
-No!
-Why did you kill her,

16:33.166 --> 16:35.125
you son of a bitch?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.041
Why'd you kill her?

16:52.250 --> 16:53.250
Palermo.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.750
Helsinki, look at me.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.208
Look me in the eyes.

16:56.666 --> 16:57.625
Helsinki!

17:05.166 --> 17:06.875
Come on, brother.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.208
Rio, Denver.

17:15.583 --> 17:16.500
Get to work.

17:17.000 --> 17:17.833
Now.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.541
<i>Palermo?</i>

17:22.333 --> 17:23.666
He's alive, sir.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.708
Son of a bitch.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.166
Are you having one?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.833
You're having an anxiety thing.

17:52.916 --> 17:55.000
It was very tense up there.

17:56.666 --> 17:58.041
It'll pass in a minute.

18:35.125 --> 18:39.125
I already know I'm fucked, Commissioner.
You don't need to remind me.

18:42.041 --> 18:45.208
-What I want to know is what happened.
-Call them.

18:45.291 --> 18:49.125
I've been a negotiator for 15 years.
I know when a deal's been accepted.

18:49.208 --> 18:52.000
Call them.
You'll be with them in 24 hours.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.458
We won't come after you.

18:53.541 --> 18:57.000
She was against the ropes.
She was going to sell the Professor out.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.500
<i>I'd worn her down.</i>
<i>I'd almost defeated her.</i>

18:59.583 --> 19:00.791
<i>Then something happened.</i>

19:03.250 --> 19:05.916
But what can happen
when someone is incommunicado?

19:11.208 --> 19:12.916
Maybe she wasn't incommunicado.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.333
Antoñanzas, stay and watch Murillo.

19:15.583 --> 19:16.916
Don't let anyone in.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.750
<i>Antoñanzas?</i>

19:35.500 --> 19:37.041
What do you think...

19:38.083 --> 19:38.916
Commissioner?

19:39.666 --> 19:41.541
Should we go after Antoñanzas?

19:42.958 --> 19:45.000
Smart creature.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.875
It's really like a vacation.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.958
I'll come back for you, Commissioner.

20:01.708 --> 20:06.333
<i>Court proceedings have been initiated</i>
<i>against Alicia Sierra</i>

20:06.416 --> 20:08.416
<i>and a warrant issued for her arrest.</i>

20:08.500 --> 20:11.208
<i>The police negotiator</i>
<i>could be the first arrest</i>

20:11.291 --> 20:13.958
<i>in the Bank of Spain heist,</i>
<i>absurd as it sounds.</i>

20:14.041 --> 20:16.750
<i>She's accused of false imprisonment</i>
<i>and torture</i>

20:16.833 --> 20:20.666
<i>following the press conference</i>
<i>from the Ministry of the Interior.</i>

20:20.750 --> 20:24.958
<i>The minister, the director of the CNI,</i>
<i>and police commanders</i>

20:25.041 --> 20:29.166
<i>are preparing libel and slander lawsuits</i>
<i>against the inspector.</i>

20:29.250 --> 20:32.291
<i>Confirmed.</i>
<i>Interior requests her immediate arrest.</i>

20:35.916 --> 20:37.166
Go after her!

20:50.375 --> 20:51.458
I'm sorry.

20:56.791 --> 20:59.583
I'm directly responsible
for all this shit.

21:01.708 --> 21:05.000
I didn't calculate the pain
it'd cause you. I'm sorry.

21:05.666 --> 21:07.916
What do you know about pain, Palermo?

21:13.833 --> 21:15.416
Pain is a loan shark.

21:19.625 --> 21:22.791
It leaves you with a debt
that you can never pay back.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.708
I can take pain.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.541
A lot of pain.

21:29.166 --> 21:34.250
Oh, yeah?
What about the pain you're feeling now?

21:36.041 --> 21:37.625
It's different, right?

21:38.166 --> 21:39.958
I saw it in your eyes.

21:42.416 --> 21:45.208
It was like seeing myself in the mirror.

21:46.916 --> 21:48.750
<i>You have no idea...</i>

21:50.541 --> 21:51.875
<i>where you'll fall.</i>

21:53.625 --> 21:55.375
Get out of there now.

21:59.875 --> 22:04.000
Otherwise, you run the risk of...
becoming a piece of shit like me.

22:04.375 --> 22:09.416
This horrible monster I've turned into.
A guy who destroys everything he touches.

22:11.208 --> 22:13.750
Someone who's wanted to die
for many years.

22:17.625 --> 22:20.708
And you can't get out of there.
You never get out.

22:22.041 --> 22:22.958
Look, brother.

22:24.791 --> 22:27.041
All that "boom, boom, ciao" crap...

22:27.125 --> 22:29.333
I treated you like shit.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.375
I didn't dare. I couldn't.
I didn't know how.

22:33.333 --> 22:36.333
But let me say, I'm by your side.
I won't let you fall.

22:36.416 --> 22:37.583
I know.

22:38.541 --> 22:40.458
I've known from the start.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.208
I know who you are.

22:46.291 --> 22:48.458
My name is Martín Berrote.

22:50.541 --> 22:55.416
I was born in Buenos Aires,
but I live in Palermo, Sicily.

22:55.500 --> 22:59.666
I'm going to get you out of here alive.
Even if I have to die doing it.

23:00.916 --> 23:02.750
My name is Mirko Dragic.

23:03.625 --> 23:05.000
I'm from Belgrade.

23:05.375 --> 23:08.125
I lost Oslo in the Mint.

23:08.583 --> 23:09.916
I lost Nairobi.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.416
And I'm not losing anyone else.

23:14.333 --> 23:17.250
You included, Martín Berrote.

23:29.791 --> 23:31.583
NATIONAL COURT
09:34 HOURS

23:31.666 --> 23:34.500
<i>Lisbon will start testifying</i>
<i>at the National Court.</i>

23:34.583 --> 23:38.750
<i>She'll give reliable, specific details,</i>
<i>earning the judge's trust.</i>

23:38.833 --> 23:41.916
<i>And she'll do it meticulously</i>
<i>because all of this...</i>

23:43.000 --> 23:44.958
is part of the Paris Plan.

23:45.666 --> 23:47.250
What is the Paris Plan?

23:50.708 --> 23:53.375
A rescue plan
in case either of us is caught.

23:58.375 --> 23:59.625
But why Paris?

24:03.666 --> 24:06.916
Because Paris is the city of freedom.

24:11.875 --> 24:13.291
And of love.

24:15.125 --> 24:18.500
Who hasn't strolled around Paris in love?
Right, boys?

24:20.208 --> 24:22.458
What will Lisbon tell the judge?

24:22.541 --> 24:25.333
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

24:25.416 --> 24:27.916
And in fact, she'll start with love.

24:28.625 --> 24:32.875
How did you reunite with Sergio Marquina?
Did you arrange it?

24:33.875 --> 24:36.041
I met him a year after we escaped,

24:36.125 --> 24:37.916
<i>in Palawan in the Philippines.</i>

24:38.333 --> 24:42.541
He left me a puzzle with coordinates.
He might not look it, but he's romantic.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.666
She'll tell them everything.

24:44.833 --> 24:48.416
Everything: where we lived,
how often we relocated.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.916
After an hour and a half,
she'll tell them the plan.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.083
What do you mean?

24:53.166 --> 24:54.875
-She can't do that.
-She can.

24:54.958 --> 24:58.291
Truth is the basis of trust,
and that's a fact.

24:58.375 --> 25:01.625
The plan's to steal 90 tons of gold
from the national reserve.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.958
We're melting it.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.250
-They're melting it in there?
-Of course.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.791
By now, they'll have done around 50 tons.

25:09.875 --> 25:13.041
We're using industrial furnaces
made by Hormund.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.125
Hormund.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.833
German. They're the best.

25:16.875 --> 25:20.125
-Benjamín, how are we doing?
<i>-</i>Seven and a half meters!

25:20.208 --> 25:21.333
Faster.

25:21.416 --> 25:22.625
Faster!

25:23.958 --> 25:25.958
We'll give them all the details.

25:26.041 --> 25:29.708
They reach 2,300ºC,
and gold melts at 1,064ºC.

25:30.291 --> 25:34.083
We'll overwhelm them
with technical details, so their brains...

25:34.166 --> 25:36.291
have to keep processing information.

25:36.375 --> 25:41.166
We knew that the vault floods
at a rate of 7,500 liters a minute.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.125
Very detailed information.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.666
And we'll do that to...

25:45.333 --> 25:47.291
-tire them out.
-That's right.

25:47.375 --> 25:49.583
The challenge
was the interconnection tube.

25:49.666 --> 25:51.500
Can I have some paper and a pen?

25:51.583 --> 25:53.541
I'm going to tire you out.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.833
-Meters?
-Nine meters!

25:59.916 --> 26:00.750
Faster.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.541
<i>The vault door...</i>

26:02.625 --> 26:03.875
14 tons of steel...

26:03.958 --> 26:06.833
We had to cut a circle in it
in just minutes...

26:06.916 --> 26:08.166
The bathyscaphe floods...

26:08.250 --> 26:11.250
The diver enters...
We weld the tube...

26:11.333 --> 26:15.083
...to equalize the pressure...
...it comes out the other side.

26:15.166 --> 26:16.541
A bit like this.

26:21.583 --> 26:23.583
Have some dinner brought in.

26:27.416 --> 26:30.500
<i>They say that pregnant women</i>
<i>have a sharper sense of smell.</i>

26:31.375 --> 26:34.333
<i>It was perhaps the only thing</i>
<i>the Professor hadn't foreseen.</i>

26:35.125 --> 26:37.750
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>someone had picked up his scent</i>

26:37.833 --> 26:39.208
<i>without him sensing it.</i>

26:42.958 --> 26:46.333
<i>Antoñanzas's wife</i>
<i>had not yet seen the news.</i>

26:47.541 --> 26:49.875
-Marisa?
-<i>Sierra took less than 3 minutes</i>

26:49.958 --> 26:51.958
<i>to get the information she needed.</i>

26:52.041 --> 26:55.083
-I'm a colleague of Benito's.
-I know who you are.

26:56.083 --> 27:00.333
Let me see, where do I begin?
Benito has been acting...

27:00.958 --> 27:04.750
-weird lately, nervous...
<i>-Antoñanzas had seemed anxious at home.</i>

27:04.833 --> 27:07.500
<i>So much so,</i>
<i>he'd been swimming late at night</i>

27:07.583 --> 27:09.625
<i>with two friends in the pool.</i>

27:10.416 --> 27:13.125
<i>And it seemed like he was drunk.</i>

27:16.666 --> 27:19.875
<i>Colonel, Sierra isn't at home.</i>
<i>She must have fled.</i>

27:19.958 --> 27:21.958
Fucking bitch.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.625
All units, an arrest warrant's been issued
for Alicia Sierra.

27:28.166 --> 27:31.500
I can't give you the footage
even if you are an officer.

27:31.666 --> 27:36.125
I need permission from a judge
or the residents' association president.

27:36.208 --> 27:39.000
Oh wait, someone's calling me.

27:40.083 --> 27:43.000
It's the residents' association president.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.291
How are you, President?

27:49.125 --> 27:50.500
OK, thank you.

27:52.625 --> 27:53.458
He says yes.

27:54.708 --> 27:58.000
Give me the tapes of the entrance,

27:58.083 --> 28:01.583
the pool, the parking lot, the street...
All of them.

28:17.375 --> 28:18.750
Listen, Amanda.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.791
What you did before...

28:22.041 --> 28:24.875
Making unfounded accusations against me--

28:24.958 --> 28:27.791
-I don't want to hear it. Leave me alone.
-Look--

28:27.875 --> 28:32.166
Didn't you hear her? Leave her alone.
Don't make me kick you out of here.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.416
What are you doing?

28:33.500 --> 28:35.833
Everyone quiet, now!

28:40.333 --> 28:43.375
You're despicable. You make me cringe.

28:43.458 --> 28:45.958
You're calling me despicable? You?

28:46.041 --> 28:47.125
A banker.

28:47.208 --> 28:50.291
A puppet of the system and of capitalism.

28:50.375 --> 28:53.250
<i>You're</i> giving <i>me</i> lessons in ethics?

28:53.333 --> 28:56.666
A man who didn't have the balls
to defend his workers

28:56.750 --> 28:58.708
-and face the terrorists.
-Enough!

29:00.583 --> 29:01.416
On the ground!

29:01.500 --> 29:03.791
Hands behind your head!

29:03.875 --> 29:05.500
Come on. All right!

29:05.583 --> 29:06.833
You, over there!

29:06.916 --> 29:09.083
-Arturo!
-Everyone on their feet.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.916
I'll get you out, I promise.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.791
All of you! That's the difference
between you and me, Governor.

29:14.875 --> 29:18.416
I came to save all these people,
to be a hero.

29:18.500 --> 29:22.291
While you piss your pants
at the slightest thing.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.458
-Governor.
-Arturo.

29:25.333 --> 29:26.375
She's got a gun.

29:26.458 --> 29:31.541
You're going to put that G36 on the floor
in the next three seconds.

29:31.625 --> 29:33.375
If you don't, you're dead.

29:35.750 --> 29:38.541
Who are you?
If you don't mind me asking.

29:38.625 --> 29:41.625
Manila. Undercover agent for the gang.

29:41.708 --> 29:42.625
Well, look...

29:43.541 --> 29:45.833
Manila, I don't buy a word of it.

29:45.916 --> 29:49.000
And that gun is one of the fake ones
they give us.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.166
You don't fool me.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.958
You have two seconds.
Put the gun down,

29:54.041 --> 29:56.583
and pray it's not true you raped Amanda.

29:56.666 --> 29:59.708
You're pissing me off.
I'm losing my patience.

29:59.791 --> 30:01.000
-One.
-So--

30:06.500 --> 30:08.583
I didn't rape her.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.541
I just gave her some anxiety meds.

30:11.625 --> 30:12.958
I'm bleeding out.

30:13.541 --> 30:14.625
I'm dying.

30:14.708 --> 30:17.041
You're not. There's an exit wound.

30:17.125 --> 30:20.041
There are no arteries
or anything important there.

30:20.541 --> 30:24.666
Arturo, you're under arrest,
accused of rape.

30:25.041 --> 30:25.916
And...

30:27.916 --> 30:33.750
may I remind you
that you offered me pills too, scumbag.

30:36.166 --> 30:39.041
<i>That night in the bank, no one slept.</i>

30:39.500 --> 30:41.125
<i>But the worst news</i>

30:41.791 --> 30:45.291
<i>was that, outside,</i>
<i>our biggest enemy was wasting no time.</i>

30:47.625 --> 30:51.958
<i>Sierra saw Antoñanzas fall.</i>
<i>She saw him hit the springboard.</i>

30:54.458 --> 30:57.375
<i>Seconds later,</i>
<i>the Professor and Marseille appeared.</i>

30:59.333 --> 31:01.833
<i>It was 3:11 in the morning.</i>

31:09.625 --> 31:13.250
<i>Minutes later, she had the license plate.</i>

31:18.583 --> 31:20.666
What's up, cutie?

31:21.291 --> 31:24.291
<i>-Fuck, Alicia, don't give me shit.</i>
<i>-</i>Take it easy.

31:24.375 --> 31:27.458
I have a license plate
from April 7 at 3:00 a.m.

31:27.541 --> 31:30.791
It left a street off the M-30.
I need to know where it went.

31:30.875 --> 31:33.416
<i>You're a wanted woman.</i>
<i>I'm taking a risk.</i>

31:33.500 --> 31:36.208
How many times
have I taken risks for you, Raúl?

31:37.083 --> 31:40.583
Should I remind you of the last time?
Don't fuck with me.

31:47.875 --> 31:48.708
Meters?

31:48.791 --> 31:50.166
Nine and a half!

31:50.500 --> 31:52.291
Lisbon's mission...

31:53.000 --> 31:56.083
is to buy us the time we need.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.125
You see...

31:58.166 --> 32:00.708
people can concentrate
for about 50 minutes.

32:00.791 --> 32:03.708
However important that information is,

32:03.791 --> 32:06.375
there's a point
when you can't take any more.

32:07.208 --> 32:10.250
They'll have no choice
but to continue the next day.

32:10.333 --> 32:13.041
Do you know anything
about underwater welding?

32:13.125 --> 32:16.000
Or about how to use
a thermic lance underwater?

32:16.083 --> 32:18.375
In water, you cut metal with fire.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.000
Fire? Underwater?

32:20.083 --> 32:22.416
-How are we doing?
-Ten meters!

32:22.916 --> 32:24.333
Faster.

32:24.416 --> 32:25.708
Faster!

32:25.791 --> 32:28.708
Fire underwater
to get to the state secrets,

32:28.791 --> 32:30.083
key to the negotiation.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.958
But it didn't work.
We had to use the dolphin.

32:33.041 --> 32:34.541
A dolphin?

32:34.625 --> 32:36.083
Ten and a half.

32:37.583 --> 32:41.625
Flipper is the name we gave
the governor of the Bank of Spain.

32:41.708 --> 32:44.916
It was the fastest way
to get the secrets and negotiate.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.916
That's an act of coercion.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.083
-I know.
-And disclosure of secrets.

32:49.666 --> 32:51.833
We sent the secrets to an external server.

32:51.916 --> 32:55.625
Lend me the pencil,
and I can outline how the IT system works.

32:56.958 --> 32:58.875
It's almost one in the morning.

32:58.958 --> 33:01.666
Maybe we should take a break.

33:01.750 --> 33:05.416
If the prosecution
and the defense agree...

33:09.000 --> 33:10.333
<i>She'll go back to prison.</i>

33:12.041 --> 33:13.750
And we'll keep chipping away...

33:14.708 --> 33:17.000
and chipping away.

33:17.875 --> 33:22.541
And between 4:00 and 4:30 in the morning,
we'll have drilled through

33:22.625 --> 33:25.791
the 11 meters and 68 centimeters
of our tunnel.

33:25.875 --> 33:30.000
And at last...
we'll access the parking garage.

33:32.125 --> 33:34.666
-Questions?
-How do we get into the garage

33:34.750 --> 33:36.583
without being seen?

33:36.833 --> 33:38.625
Good!

33:38.708 --> 33:40.333
Very good question.

33:40.416 --> 33:42.791
In two stages. First: Pakistan.

33:42.875 --> 33:43.916
-Pakistan.
-Yes.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.833
And you'll give the order.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.541
The mole is out for a walk.

33:58.875 --> 33:59.875
Shakir.

34:00.416 --> 34:02.500
-Shakir, now.
-Perfect, Professor.

34:02.583 --> 34:07.166
From Pakistan, they'll change the signal
of the internal CCTV.

34:07.250 --> 34:11.291
<i>And from then on,</i>
<i>the guards will see a recording.</i>

34:14.291 --> 34:16.916
Stage two: Marseille.

34:17.791 --> 34:20.541
Marseille will be
at that critical point on a night out,

34:20.625 --> 34:23.791
when all the bars in Madrid
have closed, but...

34:24.583 --> 34:28.458
you want to keep dancing
with your new hookup,

34:28.541 --> 34:29.833
Sheila.

34:31.125 --> 34:31.958
Marseille.

34:32.750 --> 34:33.750
Speaking.

34:34.541 --> 34:36.250
-Benjamín?
-Speaking.

34:36.333 --> 34:40.250
And that will drown out the noise
of the angle grinders.

34:40.833 --> 34:41.833
Stopwatches.

34:46.291 --> 34:48.125
Three, two...

34:48.208 --> 34:49.250
<i>one...</i>

34:50.250 --> 34:51.083
now.

34:53.375 --> 34:54.750
Now.

35:18.625 --> 35:21.250
Good evening. Is there a problem?

35:21.333 --> 35:23.208
What the hell are you doing?

35:23.291 --> 35:25.791
Having a party. All the bars are closed.

35:25.875 --> 35:29.666
So we're having a little party
here in the car.

35:30.416 --> 35:32.708
<i>Marseille, hang on.</i>

35:32.791 --> 35:34.083
Hang on, Marseille.

35:35.708 --> 35:36.791
One minute!

35:38.625 --> 35:42.000
What sort of party is it
with alcohol-free beer?

35:42.583 --> 35:44.833
Well, I want to make love tonight.

35:44.916 --> 35:46.791
And with alcohol...

35:47.375 --> 35:48.791
And without alcohol...

35:50.541 --> 35:51.750
Turn off the music.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.208
Benjamín!

35:55.291 --> 35:56.375
Thirty seconds!

35:57.000 --> 35:58.833
Don't turn it off, Marseille.

35:58.916 --> 36:00.750
-What?
-Turn off the music.

36:03.541 --> 36:04.958
<i>Twenty seconds!</i>

36:05.375 --> 36:08.875
-Turn off the damn music.
-Hold on, Marseille.

36:11.333 --> 36:13.083
-Get out of the car.
-<i>Hold on.</i>

36:13.166 --> 36:14.416
<i>Ten seconds!</i>

36:15.500 --> 36:17.333
-Get out.
-Five seconds!

36:22.958 --> 36:24.750
<i>The burrow is open.</i>

36:25.208 --> 36:26.250
We're in.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.916
OK.

36:30.875 --> 36:31.916
Get out of here.

36:55.916 --> 36:57.208
We're in.

36:57.916 --> 36:58.750
Benjamín.

37:00.041 --> 37:00.875
<i>Stage three.</i>

37:01.375 --> 37:02.416
Roger that.

37:12.333 --> 37:13.166
Hello.

37:13.625 --> 37:14.875
<i>M-607.</i>

37:14.958 --> 37:19.000
<i>The last CCTV sighting was</i>
<i>at kilometer 29, the Colmenar Viejo exit.</i>

37:32.500 --> 37:38.416
Eight in the morning on the second day...
the last stage begins.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.958
<i>That's when Lisbon will leave</i>
<i>Soto del Real prison,</i>

37:42.041 --> 37:45.291
<i>guarded by the same convoy</i>
<i>as the day before.</i>

37:50.250 --> 37:51.875
She's just left the prison.

37:52.583 --> 37:53.500
<i>Get ready.</i>

37:54.625 --> 37:57.208
Tokyo, get Gandía ready.

37:57.291 --> 38:00.416
<i>At 8:35, she'll arrive</i>
<i>at the National Court.</i>

38:00.500 --> 38:03.208
<i>The entrance</i>
<i>will still be full of journalists.</i>

38:03.291 --> 38:05.583
They'll repeat the same procedure.

38:06.708 --> 38:09.250
<i>They'll go into the parking garage.</i>

38:10.375 --> 38:12.208
<i>But there's one difference...</i>

38:13.000 --> 38:15.208
you will already be there.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.916
But nobody will be able to see you.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.416
Because overnight...

38:21.208 --> 38:23.208
you'll have built a false wall.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.875
Jeez, Louise!

38:24.958 --> 38:27.916
<i>You'll have three hours to build that wall</i>

38:28.000 --> 38:32.333
<i>before the first National Court employees</i>
<i>arrive at 7:00 a.m.</i>

38:34.625 --> 38:35.750
That wall

38:35.833 --> 38:39.666
<i>will be just small enough</i>
<i>that no one will notice it,</i>

38:40.583 --> 38:43.250
<i>but big enough for you to hide behind.</i>

38:55.250 --> 38:56.125
Perfect.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.083
And then comes
the David Copperfield moment.

39:07.833 --> 39:11.208
How to extract someone

39:11.291 --> 39:15.958
<i>from a van guarded by six other vehicles</i>
<i>and surrounded by civil guards</i>

39:16.500 --> 39:20.583
without anyone realizing.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.166
How to do it so that life goes on...

39:25.500 --> 39:27.500
as if nothing had happened.

39:30.541 --> 39:34.000
For that, we need to move
the next piece on the board.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.208
And it's an essential piece.

39:47.583 --> 39:51.416
The time has come...
for you to decide your fate:

39:52.416 --> 39:54.541
life or death.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.583
We've reconnected your equipment.

39:57.708 --> 40:00.875
You'll call the tent,
you'll speak to Tamayo,

40:00.958 --> 40:03.458
and you'll say you killed Nairobi.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.625
Fucking son of a bitch.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.208
And killed me too.

40:13.083 --> 40:15.708
That we haven't found the panic room yet,

40:15.875 --> 40:17.583
but that we're about to.

40:17.750 --> 40:20.833
That you're going out
and that you've got a radio.

40:21.458 --> 40:22.333
What's up?

40:24.291 --> 40:27.375
Am I turning you on
like when I rammed the shrapnel into you?

40:30.083 --> 40:31.000
Get to it.

40:44.708 --> 40:45.750
<i>Command center.</i>

40:48.833 --> 40:50.291
It's César Gandía.

40:51.291 --> 40:54.500
Head of security
for the governor of the Bank of Spain.

40:56.375 --> 41:00.125
It's a ruse. They caught me!
They're trying to set you up!

41:00.625 --> 41:01.458
<i>Gandía...</i>

41:02.875 --> 41:04.000
it's the Professor.

41:04.916 --> 41:06.916
<i>We fully expected you to do this,</i>

41:07.000 --> 41:10.458
<i>but that was your one chance</i>
<i>to get it wrong.</i>

41:10.666 --> 41:12.666
<i>The next call will be to Tamayo.</i>

41:12.750 --> 41:15.541
<i>-Do it again...</i>
-Think of your son, Juanito.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.541
<i>...and Tokyo will kill you.</i>

41:19.041 --> 41:20.333
You hear me, Tokyo?

41:20.875 --> 41:23.500
-Loud and clear.
-<i>Listen to me, Tokyo.</i>

41:24.333 --> 41:28.750
You'll hang up... and you'll kill him.

41:30.125 --> 41:32.250
<i>I want you to understand one thing.</i>

41:32.333 --> 41:35.750
<i>You can't win now.</i>
<i>You've already lost. Do you understand?</i>

41:35.833 --> 41:39.208
The heroic thing to do
is to see your wife and son again.

41:40.333 --> 41:41.958
<i>If not, they'll lose you.</i>

41:43.375 --> 41:44.583
They'll lose you.

41:45.583 --> 41:47.083
<i>Do you hear me, Tokyo?</i>

41:48.500 --> 41:49.666
Get to it.

42:04.750 --> 42:05.583
Suárez.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.291
Martínez!

42:09.958 --> 42:10.791
Colonel!

42:10.875 --> 42:11.916
It's Gandía.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.458
Gandía, I'm here.

42:14.541 --> 42:17.041
Colonel, I'm in the panic room.

42:17.916 --> 42:19.833
They're about to find it.

42:19.916 --> 42:22.083
I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.750
<i>I'm launching another attack.</i>

42:24.833 --> 42:27.333
I'll take a radio. This is the frequency.

42:29.083 --> 42:32.625
-I want all units on alert.
-Alpha and Beta units, get ready.

42:32.708 --> 42:35.916
<i>-Everyone ready and on alert.</i>
<i>-</i>Go.

42:38.625 --> 42:40.291
Four, six, two,

42:40.375 --> 42:43.083
point, six, six, two.

42:47.375 --> 42:48.625
Come with us.

42:50.916 --> 42:53.875
If we don't get Lisbon
when she arrives, what do we do?

42:53.958 --> 42:55.583
Wait in the wall for 10 hours?

42:55.666 --> 42:59.833
This time, it'll take her
less than 20 minutes to come back.

43:01.291 --> 43:04.791
<i>They'll insist, of course,</i>
<i>but she'll be within her rights.</i>

43:07.916 --> 43:09.916
I've decided not to testify.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.541
Mrs. Murillo, yesterday
you seriously incriminated yourself.

43:13.750 --> 43:15.916
I advise you not to backtrack.

43:16.333 --> 43:18.791
You could get penal benefits.

43:18.875 --> 43:22.458
The judge will be forced
to send her to prison.

43:22.541 --> 43:26.916
The same guards who took her in
will take her back to the parking garage.

43:27.541 --> 43:31.208
But no one will be watching,
because the security control room

43:31.291 --> 43:34.000
<i>will be seeing the recording</i>
<i>from the night before.</i>

43:37.666 --> 43:39.791
<i>The first time Lisbon arrived.</i>

43:39.875 --> 43:41.166
<i>And then,</i>

43:41.250 --> 43:43.041
they'll cross paths with...

43:44.041 --> 43:46.916
a judge... a prosecutor...

43:49.750 --> 43:50.958
a police officer...

43:51.291 --> 43:53.291
and two lawyers.

43:55.916 --> 43:58.375
Well, maybe you should be the prisoner.

44:01.250 --> 44:02.250
Benjamín.

44:03.083 --> 44:05.125
-Everyone ready?
-Ready.

44:09.208 --> 44:10.416
Now.

44:20.833 --> 44:22.666
-<i>Benjamín.</i>
-I see her.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.208
Twenty-five meters.

44:35.833 --> 44:37.083
Ten meters.

44:41.583 --> 44:43.208
The signal will be...

44:45.833 --> 44:46.833
"Good morning."

44:46.916 --> 44:47.916
Three meters.

44:49.958 --> 44:51.000
Good morning.

45:06.708 --> 45:09.333
-Good morning, Ms. Lisbon.
-Hello.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.416
Let's go.

45:11.666 --> 45:14.583
We won't make it easy for them:
within 45 seconds,

45:14.666 --> 45:17.625
they'll have explosives
strapped to their chests.

45:17.708 --> 45:22.583
<i>Within 55, two cameras and two microphones</i>
<i>will be watching them</i> <i>so that...</i>

45:25.333 --> 45:27.416
if they change the route...

45:27.500 --> 45:28.416
Boom.

45:29.041 --> 45:31.708
If they attempt to raise the alarm...

45:32.291 --> 45:33.250
Boom.

45:33.333 --> 45:36.500
If you don't drive the prisoner
back to the prison...

45:36.583 --> 45:37.500
Boom.

45:39.375 --> 45:42.166
Are we taking the prisoner or not?

45:42.250 --> 45:45.000
We'll give them another Lisbon.

45:59.125 --> 45:59.958
Officers...

46:01.791 --> 46:04.583
everything OK? You're taking a long time.

46:07.041 --> 46:08.916
Yes, everything's fine.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.750
-We're coming up now.
-<i>OK, understood.</i>

46:13.875 --> 46:17.625
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the great magic trick begins.</i>

46:17.708 --> 46:20.166
<i>The climax</i>
<i>of the David Copperfield show.</i>

46:20.250 --> 46:22.666
-Who is this Copperfield?
-The magician.

46:22.750 --> 46:26.208
-Wasn't that Harry Potter?
-It'll seem like nothing's changed.

46:32.666 --> 46:34.041
But it won't be.

46:38.500 --> 46:42.458
<i>Because we'll have someone crawling</i>
<i>through the tunnel at top speed.</i>

47:01.208 --> 47:02.041
Come on.

47:08.041 --> 47:09.000
Come on.

48:17.291 --> 48:18.166
Let's go.

48:24.541 --> 48:25.375
Tokyo...

48:26.291 --> 48:27.791
<i>Lisbon is on the way.</i>

48:27.875 --> 48:30.250
<i>Begin the countdown... now.</i>

48:32.083 --> 48:33.041
Run!

48:34.916 --> 48:36.916
Colonel, they're shooting!

48:37.958 --> 48:38.916
Gandía!

48:39.000 --> 48:41.166
-<i>Gandía, answer me.</i>
-Gandía here.

48:41.291 --> 48:42.583
Gandía here!

48:42.666 --> 48:45.875
-They're closing in on me.
-They're closing in on me.

48:45.958 --> 48:48.083
-I'm caught in the cross fire.
-Good.

48:49.708 --> 48:50.541
Up you go.

48:53.041 --> 48:56.125
-Where are you? Can we give cover fire?
-Negative.

48:56.208 --> 48:57.541
<i>Negative, Colonel.</i>

48:57.625 --> 49:00.458
-I'm going to the roof.
-I'm going to the roof.

49:00.541 --> 49:03.333
-I request evacuation.
-<i>I request evacuation!</i>

49:03.416 --> 49:05.750
Suárez, send a helicopter, now.

49:05.833 --> 49:07.875
-Come on!
-Delta 1, prepare for takeoff.

49:07.958 --> 49:10.000
Rescue operation at the Bank of Spain,
now!

49:11.875 --> 49:13.208
Hold on, Gandía.

49:13.291 --> 49:15.166
I have an M16 and 3 magazines.

49:15.250 --> 49:17.625
<i>I don't know how long I can hold out.</i>

49:18.791 --> 49:19.958
Fire. Now.

49:29.250 --> 49:32.958
-They started a fire.
-They're starting a fire. I can't see!

49:33.041 --> 49:34.833
Colonel.

49:34.916 --> 49:36.083
<i>Smoke on the roof.</i>

49:36.166 --> 49:38.333
Hold on. The helicopter's coming.

49:53.666 --> 49:54.625
Lisbon.

49:54.708 --> 49:56.500
-Marseille.
-Marseille.

49:57.125 --> 49:58.625
We have Lisbon.

49:59.291 --> 50:00.333
Switch to blanks.

50:12.333 --> 50:13.958
Let's go!

50:27.083 --> 50:29.750
<i>Where will you get a military helicopter?</i>

50:30.750 --> 50:34.791
The same place we got the vehicles
for the heist: the black market.

50:34.875 --> 50:37.875
Not only that,
we'll intercept their communications

50:37.958 --> 50:43.166
so that when they contact the helicopter,
it'll be us who answer.

50:44.416 --> 50:46.166
<i>Where's the helicopter?</i>

50:46.250 --> 50:47.500
Delta, position.

50:48.083 --> 50:48.916
Time?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.750
Two minutes, fifty seconds.

50:50.833 --> 50:54.500
-Two minutes, 50 seconds.
-Go to the roof. We'll cover you.

50:54.583 --> 50:57.416
I can't.
There's plastic explosive on the door.

50:57.500 --> 51:00.750
-For fuck's sake! Bomb disposal!
-Bomb disposal!

51:02.458 --> 51:05.333
-Describe the device.
-Blue wire to the primer.

51:05.416 --> 51:08.666
There's a movement sensor
and a blue wire to the primer.

51:14.166 --> 51:16.291
Cut it. It's a simple device.

51:16.375 --> 51:17.333
-You sure?
-Yes.

51:17.416 --> 51:18.625
-No!
-Cut it.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.041
No. Colonel!

51:22.958 --> 51:26.041
-Wire cut.
-Wire cut!

51:26.125 --> 51:27.375
Denver, now.

51:28.375 --> 51:30.375
I'm in black. Don't shoot.

51:30.458 --> 51:31.666
-Door.
-Exiting now.

51:31.750 --> 51:34.500
I'm wearing black and a ski mask.
Hold fire.

51:36.625 --> 51:38.250
Our man's in black. Cover him.

51:38.333 --> 51:40.958
<i>-Be ready for possible cross fire.</i>
-<i>Copy.</i>

51:45.250 --> 51:46.875
<i>Switch to blanks.</i>

51:46.958 --> 51:47.958
Go!

51:48.458 --> 51:50.166
Let's go!

51:53.833 --> 51:55.708
They're on the roof. They're firing!

51:59.666 --> 52:01.583
Cover fire!

52:01.666 --> 52:03.458
<i>There's smoke. I don't have a shot.</i>

52:05.791 --> 52:07.416
-<i>Tokyo, now.</i>
-Palermo?

52:09.458 --> 52:10.750
Open.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.333
-<i>Searching for target.</i>
-<i>No visual.</i>

52:30.833 --> 52:32.166
<i>I've got them. I see them!</i>

52:33.250 --> 52:34.666
<i>Target in sight.</i>

52:37.291 --> 52:38.500
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

52:39.291 --> 52:40.750
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

52:41.416 --> 52:43.875
-<i>They're shooting at us!</i>
-Motherfuckers.

52:43.958 --> 52:45.250
<i>We're exposed.</i>

52:45.333 --> 52:47.333
-They're exposed!
-<i>Take cover!</i>

52:47.416 --> 52:49.166
<i>We're retreating to cover.</i>

52:49.250 --> 52:53.083
Delta, begin approach maneuver.
Rescue protocol.

52:53.416 --> 52:55.416
I want a quick, clean extraction.

53:04.541 --> 53:05.416
Marseille.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.916
-Arriving.
-Helicopter in position.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.875
-Get it down there!
-Go ahead.

53:21.541 --> 53:24.041
-Permission to descend, sir!
-Proceed.

53:32.666 --> 53:34.458
Back in the helicopter, now!

53:44.250 --> 53:45.208
Lisbon!

53:45.291 --> 53:47.916
-Denver!
<i>-</i>Welcome to the Bank of Spain!

53:56.750 --> 54:00.375
Package delivered, Professor.
I'll be out in two minutes.

54:02.875 --> 54:04.750
Where's the helicopter going?

54:05.833 --> 54:09.041
Delta 1, what's going on?
Return to your position!

54:09.125 --> 54:10.708
-Delta 1, come in!
-Fuck!

54:19.541 --> 54:22.875
There's a problem with the helicopter.
We're gonna tackle them.

54:26.916 --> 54:29.083
Where'd that agent come from?
What balls.

54:39.708 --> 54:41.541
They're retreating.

54:49.375 --> 54:50.416
Are you OK?

54:54.833 --> 54:55.666
Yes?

54:56.333 --> 54:57.541
What?

54:58.750 --> 55:02.083
A call from Soto del Real.
The convoy that transferred Murillo.

55:02.166 --> 55:05.791
I have a woman here who was kidnapped
as she left the hairdressers.

55:05.875 --> 55:09.416
What do I care?
This is the command center for the heist!

55:09.500 --> 55:10.750
Here, asshole.

55:11.458 --> 55:13.083
Gandía, hold on!

55:13.166 --> 55:15.791
Stay on the stairs
till the helicopter returns.

55:15.875 --> 55:17.833
Where's the fucking helicopter?

55:20.875 --> 55:21.708
Colonel...

55:22.500 --> 55:23.541
-What?
-Colonel.

55:26.250 --> 55:29.250
The situation seems to be... a trick.

55:45.791 --> 55:48.166
-Yes!
-Come on!

55:51.708 --> 55:53.083
Yes!

55:56.291 --> 55:57.666
Fuck yeah!

55:57.750 --> 55:59.125
-Yes!
-Professor.

55:59.208 --> 56:00.666
<i>Lisbon is with us.</i>

56:00.750 --> 56:03.916
<i>I repeat, Lisbon is with us!</i>

56:19.625 --> 56:20.833
Fuck yeah!

56:22.291 --> 56:23.458
<i>Listen to me.</i>

56:27.166 --> 56:28.250
This war...

56:30.500 --> 56:31.708
We're going to win.

56:34.375 --> 56:35.333
For Nairobi.

56:36.583 --> 56:37.458
For Nairobi.

56:39.625 --> 56:40.500
For Nairobi.

56:42.750 --> 56:43.625
For Nairobi.

56:43.708 --> 56:44.875
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

56:45.833 --> 56:47.208
<i>For Nairobi.</i>

56:48.208 --> 56:49.250
For Nairobi.

56:51.583 --> 56:53.458
For Nairobi!

56:54.083 --> 56:56.000
For Nairobi!

56:56.083 --> 56:57.875
For Nairobi!

56:57.958 --> 56:59.791
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

56:59.875 --> 57:02.958
For Nairobi!

57:03.041 --> 57:05.708
For Nairobi!

57:05.791 --> 57:08.500
For Nairobi!

57:13.125 --> 57:15.333
<i>For Nairobi!</i>

57:19.500 --> 57:20.416
Don't move.

57:51.833 --> 57:53.583
Checkmate, son of a bitch.
