01:03.100 --> 01:07.267
(warbling growl)
(gurgling)

01:32.300 --> 01:33.300
Hey, mate.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.467
(thudding)

02:01.833 --> 02:03.300
We'll go in a minute.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.867
(intense music)

02:05.867 --> 02:06.700
Jesus!

02:07.567 --> 02:09.833
(gurgling)

02:22.633 --> 02:25.533
(flesh squelching)

02:26.533 --> 02:28.767
(growling)

02:37.133 --> 02:39.567
[Female] Come with me.

02:39.567 --> 02:42.067
(eerie music)

05:01.467 --> 05:04.967
(camera shutter clicking)

05:30.733 --> 05:31.567
Enough.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.000
What's he doing?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.100
It's just his way, shh.

06:37.767 --> 06:41.167
(death metal rock music)

07:23.000 --> 07:24.467
Fuck's sake, go on baby.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.667
There's so many men out there.

07:26.667 --> 07:30.100
Yeah, but they're all
fucking ugly or desperate.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.700
Well, (mumbles).

07:32.700 --> 07:35.500
Yeah, that's why I dumped him.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.000
No, no, I found my dog prince.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.767
I didn't know
Sutton was coming.

07:40.767 --> 07:43.067
Yeah, well he is.

07:43.067 --> 07:44.500
All over my tits.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.667
(laughing)

07:52.000 --> 07:56.167
(heavy metal music
drowns out lyrics)

08:15.600 --> 08:16.433
Ooh wow.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.033
You have to give
your body to him.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.333
Remember to take precaution.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.900
Don't worry, I'm on the pill.

08:43.067 --> 08:46.067
(suspenseful music)

10:17.467 --> 10:20.367
(glass shattering)

10:45.200 --> 10:47.000
(gasping)

10:47.000 --> 10:51.167
(growling)
(intense music)

11:04.533 --> 11:06.867
(screaming)

11:26.433 --> 11:29.433
(breathing heavily)

11:34.567 --> 11:38.733
(sinister laughing)
(eerie music)

12:37.933 --> 12:40.933
(suspenseful music)

12:54.100 --> 12:56.367
(gurgling)

13:03.400 --> 13:06.167
(dramatic music)

13:26.233 --> 13:27.600
Thanks.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.867
We must look after
you, mustn't we?

13:29.867 --> 13:31.100
What did you say?

13:31.100 --> 13:33.933
Now that you're one of us.

13:33.933 --> 13:35.267
Good day to you.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
(suspenseful music)

13:59.300 --> 14:02.100
Mommy says that you're going
to have my little brother.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.700
Can I come and see him?

14:03.700 --> 14:04.833
Natalie, what are you doing?

14:04.833 --> 14:07.433
I told you not to tell anybody.

14:07.433 --> 14:09.367
What have I told you about
talking to strangers?

14:09.367 --> 14:10.200
Do I have to...

14:10.200 --> 14:12.367
(gasping)

14:14.033 --> 14:17.867
(upbeat bass and drum music)

15:15.233 --> 15:16.633
(screaming)

15:16.633 --> 15:17.633
Trust him.

15:18.833 --> 15:19.667
Ah!

15:19.667 --> 15:21.167
(doorbell ringing)

15:21.167 --> 15:24.067
All right, all
right, I'm coming.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.400
Fucking hell.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.867
Are you all right?

15:36.867 --> 15:38.300
Do you want a cup of tea?

15:38.300 --> 15:39.400
No.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.233
Fuck.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.800
I need a cigarette.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.867
God Mel, you look horrible.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.633
What's going on?

16:11.700 --> 16:14.500
That fucker spiked me, Nick.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.467
I've been fucking
chipping out all day.

16:16.467 --> 16:20.233
Really fucking weird shit,
really fucking horrible.

16:20.233 --> 16:21.567
What happened?

16:23.667 --> 16:26.400
I don't know,
I can't remember.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.500
Ew, I feel fucking awful.

16:39.267 --> 16:42.767
What the fuck was
in those pills?

16:42.767 --> 16:46.000
I've been seeing like really
horrible faces all day.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.633
Really contorted,
demonic fucking faces.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.200
Calm, what do you mean faces?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.933
And where the fuck did he go?

16:53.933 --> 16:57.467
He just fucks me and
used me, he left to go,

16:57.467 --> 17:00.000
and so I was running through
the streets everywhere.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.200
All these people were
looking, everyone's fucking

17:02.200 --> 17:03.133
looking at me...

17:03.133 --> 17:04.067
Hey, hey, hey it's okay now.

17:04.067 --> 17:06.067
Take it easy, it's over.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.233
It's finished.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.967
I should have listened to you.

17:12.967 --> 17:14.800
He did something to me.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.067
You're fine, all right?

17:17.067 --> 17:19.467
Too much booze, too many
drugs and you just picked up

17:19.467 --> 17:21.800
a fucking idiot, it happens.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.267
I'm so stupid.

17:24.267 --> 17:26.166
Quit blaming yourself.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.000
You did nothing wrong.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.533
I should have listened to you.

17:31.533 --> 17:34.633
We should have
listened to each other.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.367
I'll drink to that.

17:42.933 --> 17:45.200
Look, I really don't
want to go home tonight.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.833
That's cool, you can
crash here if you want.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.100
We can get with some sleep.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.067
Where you going?

17:59.433 --> 18:00.533
Are you taking the pits?

18:00.533 --> 18:03.133
No, these are sleeping pills.

18:03.133 --> 18:04.700
You're gonna sleep like a baby.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.133
And wake up fine.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.600
(sinister whispering)

18:29.833 --> 18:32.067
(growling)

18:59.567 --> 19:00.400
Uh.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.533
(dramatic music)

19:20.233 --> 19:21.067
Nikki?

19:22.333 --> 19:23.167
Nikki!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.600
[Nikki] Shit Mel, what is it?

19:32.700 --> 19:34.533
Nikki wake up.

19:34.533 --> 19:35.367
Wake up.

19:38.433 --> 19:39.267
What?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.133
Touch me.

19:46.367 --> 19:47.200
Touch me.

19:48.667 --> 19:49.500
Here.

19:52.967 --> 19:53.800
Press.

19:55.367 --> 19:57.033
Can you feel that?

19:57.033 --> 19:59.433
What am I supposed to feel?

20:01.267 --> 20:03.167
You can feel it here.

20:05.767 --> 20:06.600
Press.

20:13.100 --> 20:13.933
Lower.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.300
Harder, press harder.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.400
What is it?

20:22.400 --> 20:23.667
Is it a lump?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.867
I don't know.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.500
Oh God.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.933
It's a bump.

20:29.933 --> 20:31.767
Oh Nikki, no.

20:31.767 --> 20:32.800
I don't want to know.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.533
Call an ambulance or something.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.900
He's put something
inside me, feel it!

20:36.900 --> 20:38.900
It's okay, just relax.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.933
It's just a bruise.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.333
Oh.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.333
(screaming)

21:10.333 --> 21:14.500
(scissors squelching)
(screaming)

21:50.500 --> 21:53.167
(baby babbling)

22:03.700 --> 22:07.867
(screaming)
(gurgling)

22:23.667 --> 22:25.367
[Man] Right.

22:25.367 --> 22:27.467
So you talked to everybody
across the street?

22:27.467 --> 22:28.333
[Female] I did.

22:28.333 --> 22:31.000
(mumbles)

22:31.000 --> 22:32.567
What about the other fact?

22:32.567 --> 22:34.367
(mumbles)

22:34.367 --> 22:36.800
(chattering)

22:38.833 --> 22:41.167
Fucking (mumbles) at all.

22:41.167 --> 22:44.167
Not much (mumbles).

22:46.733 --> 22:50.900
Glorious bloody technical
evidence all I fucking need.

22:52.133 --> 22:56.600
It's a fucking disgrace,
we are getting no where.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.267
A word, my office.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.400
You don't need to say it, sir.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.800
Four murders in one
week and no solid leads,

23:13.800 --> 23:16.633
it's a piss poor
showing, I know.

23:16.633 --> 23:19.167
But that new computer
system's a little off wank.

23:19.167 --> 23:22.700
With all due respect, for
every piece of crap we type in

23:22.700 --> 23:24.767
we get a load more
bullocks back.

23:24.767 --> 23:27.467
That's not what I wanted
to talk about, Pete.

23:27.467 --> 23:30.833
I've had a worrying call
from Joan, the photographer.

23:30.833 --> 23:34.100
Something about you
touching the dead bodies.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.000
Yes, sir.

23:36.067 --> 23:37.800
Just something I have to do.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.633
Okay.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.733
Any particular reason?

23:42.867 --> 23:44.667
To make sure they
really are dead.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.767
How long has this
been going on, Pete?

23:46.767 --> 23:49.033
'Bout seven years.

23:49.033 --> 23:50.700
Ever since the girl.

23:51.567 --> 23:52.833
Abigail Watson.

23:54.333 --> 23:58.100
Abigail Watson, wasn't
she one of Kemper's?

23:58.100 --> 23:59.700
His fourth victim.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.833
She was only 10 years old.

24:04.267 --> 24:08.167
That bastard raped and abused
her repeatedly for two days.

24:08.167 --> 24:09.867
I remember, Pete.

24:09.867 --> 24:11.633
You were the first to find her.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.800
He broken her pelvic bone.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.633
With his fist.

24:15.633 --> 24:18.800
Severe trauma led to a
state of advanced catalepsy.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.067
Her body functions shut down.

24:21.067 --> 24:22.400
No sign of life.

24:23.333 --> 24:24.767
I know what happened.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.233
It was all a terrible mistake.

24:26.233 --> 24:28.067
I was with her the longest.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.200
If I'd touched her
I would have known.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.133
She woke up in a fridge.

24:33.133 --> 24:34.733
Yes, but no one
could have known...

24:34.733 --> 24:38.067
She woke up in a
fridge in the morgue.

24:39.967 --> 24:42.500
They think she was awake
for at least 10 hours

24:42.500 --> 24:44.667
before she froze to death.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.667
No one heard her screams.

24:50.233 --> 24:52.700
When they eventually
pulled her out,

24:52.700 --> 24:55.867
they found she'd broken
every bone in her hands.

24:55.867 --> 24:59.800
From pounding endlessly
against the metal walls.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.700
No one should have
to suffer like that.

25:07.200 --> 25:10.033
Except maybe
bastards like Kemper.

25:11.033 --> 25:13.967
(thunder rumbling)

25:19.367 --> 25:22.133
(dramatic music)

26:04.867 --> 26:07.800
(flesh squelching)

26:27.600 --> 26:30.600
(suspenseful music)

28:22.233 --> 28:25.400
(sinister whispering)

28:31.233 --> 28:34.400
[Man] They must
be destroyed onsite.

28:35.567 --> 28:38.067
(eerie music)

29:28.567 --> 29:30.533
[Emma] What if he's in?

29:30.533 --> 29:32.267
If he's in, then
we say we're lost.

29:32.267 --> 29:35.200
I'll get directions, you
go in and use the toilet.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.033
Except you don't use the toilet.

29:37.033 --> 29:38.000
I look for money.

29:38.000 --> 29:38.833
Right.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.700
The money is where
you said it is, right?

29:56.700 --> 29:59.000
Yeah, my sister told me.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.400
He gives her a tip
from it when she does

30:00.400 --> 30:02.067
his meals on wheels.

30:07.533 --> 30:09.300
Looks like no one's in.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.867
Let's do it then.

30:29.533 --> 30:31.000
[Emma] What are you doing?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.400
About the only useful
thing my dad ever taught me.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.233
You watchin' the road?

30:50.200 --> 30:51.800
Ooh, Christ, relax.

30:53.267 --> 30:54.900
(mumbles)

30:54.900 --> 30:56.200
Shh, whisper!

30:56.200 --> 30:58.133
[Sophie] Where's
the fucking light?

30:58.133 --> 30:59.400
[Emma] Oh I can't find it.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.600
[Sophie] Got to
be here somewhere.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.833
[Emma] Shh, (mumbles)
people behind them.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.433
[Sophie] (mumbles) face at
the top of the stairs just

31:06.433 --> 31:08.000
waiting to jump out at us.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.333
(mumbles)

31:10.333 --> 31:11.167
Come on.

31:19.367 --> 31:21.700
I can't see a fucking thing.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
(mumbles)

31:26.000 --> 31:30.167
The old (mumbles) probably
hasn't paid is lucky bill.

31:46.567 --> 31:47.400
Come on.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.033
Oh!

31:54.467 --> 31:56.800
[Emma] Sophie, what is it?

31:58.133 --> 32:01.000
Fucking death
trap is what it is.

32:02.133 --> 32:03.033
Go on then.

32:10.033 --> 32:10.867
Boo!

32:12.033 --> 32:13.167
[Emma] What the
fuck you doing?

32:13.167 --> 32:14.700
Your face.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.333
You won't have a fucking
face if you do that again.

32:17.333 --> 32:20.500
Shush, the
neighbours might hear.

32:20.500 --> 32:23.667
Fuck you (mumbles).

32:26.300 --> 32:28.800
Jesus, what a fucking stank.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.933
Could be anywhere.

32:31.933 --> 32:34.900
We could be here all night.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.233
Get busy then.

32:57.733 --> 32:58.533
Not here.

33:23.267 --> 33:26.167
Jesus, his clothes
fucking stink.

33:28.233 --> 33:30.900
The whole room fucking stinks.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.000
Oh my God, Emma.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.500
Look what I found.

33:49.767 --> 33:51.400
What is it?

33:51.400 --> 33:53.467
(growling)

33:53.467 --> 33:55.233
(laughing)

33:55.233 --> 33:56.867
Oh my God, there his teeth.

33:56.867 --> 33:58.567
Kiss kiss, darling.

34:00.467 --> 34:02.133
[Emma] You're sick.

34:02.133 --> 34:03.200
(knocking)

34:03.200 --> 34:04.033
Shit.

34:06.433 --> 34:08.933
(eerie music)

34:14.233 --> 34:15.300
Let's just find the
money and get the fuck

34:15.300 --> 34:16.266
out of here, okay?

34:16.266 --> 34:18.266
You check under the bed.

34:45.033 --> 34:47.367
Sophie, look what I found.

34:49.867 --> 34:51.467
Money.

34:51.467 --> 34:53.800
(screaming)

34:55.067 --> 34:57.333
Give my fucking tin back!

34:58.233 --> 35:01.433
Give my tin (yelling).

35:04.600 --> 35:05.800
Give my tin back!

35:05.800 --> 35:09.967
(thumping)
(screaming)

35:22.067 --> 35:23.300
[Emma] Oh no.

35:24.467 --> 35:26.400
Where the fuck
did he come from?

35:26.400 --> 35:28.133
Jesus fucking Christ.

35:29.633 --> 35:32.233
Why the fuck didn't he wake up?

35:33.333 --> 35:35.533
Oh my God, Sophie.

35:35.533 --> 35:36.367
Look.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.333
Hearing aids, he's deaf.

35:41.267 --> 35:42.100
He's dead.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.133
I don't know.

35:43.133 --> 35:45.467
Just touch him or something.

35:53.233 --> 35:54.700
Nothing.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.767
Oh fuck, what a mess.

35:56.767 --> 35:59.767
What the fuck, (mumbles)

35:59.767 --> 36:00.967
so many fucking times.

36:00.967 --> 36:02.033
I had to he was
fucking attacking you.

36:02.033 --> 36:03.933
He's a deaf old man, Sophie.

36:03.933 --> 36:05.800
Didn't have to fucking kill him.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.200
Shut up, give me the money.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.167
Oh.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.700
There's got to be
a few grand here.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.800
This is a lot of money.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.667
No, it's a fuck
of a lot of money.

36:22.667 --> 36:25.000
(screaming)

36:26.733 --> 36:28.900
Where is me fucking tin?

36:29.800 --> 36:33.933
(yelling)
(screaming)

36:40.300 --> 36:43.200
(knife squelching)

37:00.300 --> 37:02.367
Are you all right?

37:02.367 --> 37:04.200
No, I'm fucking not.

37:26.633 --> 37:28.900
(thumping)

37:56.200 --> 37:58.733
(sombre music)

38:13.867 --> 38:16.633
(water sloshing)

38:18.933 --> 38:20.700
What about our clothes?

38:20.700 --> 38:22.367
Well we'll have
to get some of his.

38:22.367 --> 38:24.633
We've got to trash
everything we were wearing.

38:24.633 --> 38:25.633
No evidence.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.167
What's gonna happen, Soph?

38:28.167 --> 38:30.200
Nothing that we don't want to.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.033
If someone finds out.

38:32.033 --> 38:33.833
No one's gonna find out.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.833
What if people start
asking questions.

38:35.833 --> 38:38.800
Who the fuck's gonna ask
anything about anything?

38:38.800 --> 38:41.467
Police, I don't know, someone.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.333
You haven't told
anyone have you?

38:45.333 --> 38:46.167
No.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.400
You sure?

38:52.967 --> 38:55.100
My sister knows.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.467
You told your sister?

38:57.467 --> 38:59.333
She pretty much guessed,
anyway, when I started asking

38:59.333 --> 39:01.600
all those questions.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.433
She'll be all right
Sophie, I'll tell her,

39:03.433 --> 39:04.867
I'll explain he attacked us.

39:04.867 --> 39:06.533
It wasn't our fault.

39:08.567 --> 39:12.433
So did you tell
her I was in on it?

39:12.433 --> 39:14.100
No, of course not.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.800
I promise I didn't
tell her, Soph.

39:31.800 --> 39:35.367
Soph, it will be all
right, won't it, Soph?

39:40.567 --> 39:44.433
There's some okay
clothes over there.

39:44.433 --> 39:46.133
Look, Soph, you're my
sister and a (mumbles)

39:46.133 --> 39:47.600
if that's what
you're worried about.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.167
Shut up and just get dressed.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.100
I'm gonna need a belt.

40:08.100 --> 40:08.933
These are massive...

40:08.933 --> 40:11.167
(thumping)

41:26.767 --> 41:29.100
(screaming)

41:36.433 --> 41:39.000
(bell chiming)

41:46.467 --> 41:48.967
(eerie music)

42:58.933 --> 43:01.267
(screaming)

43:01.267 --> 43:03.767
What's your problem, Misses?

44:15.833 --> 44:16.667
Cheers.

44:25.867 --> 44:27.100
Geez, Sophie.

44:29.967 --> 44:31.400
Where's my share?

44:32.400 --> 44:34.867
(glass shattering)

44:34.867 --> 44:36.267
Where's my share?

44:37.967 --> 44:39.400
Where's my share?

44:45.533 --> 44:46.500
(screaming)

44:46.500 --> 44:48.667
(mumbles)

44:55.833 --> 44:59.933
(screaming)
(glass shattering)

45:15.267 --> 45:20.067
For fuck's sake, somebody
give me some good news.

45:20.067 --> 45:20.900
Well?

45:27.800 --> 45:30.300
We've got a positive
ID on all four bodies.

45:30.300 --> 45:31.300
Wonderful.

45:38.833 --> 45:40.200
Corbin.

45:40.200 --> 45:43.100
Now where have I
heard that before?

45:44.867 --> 45:45.700
Judge Corbin.

45:45.700 --> 45:47.167
Who's that?

45:47.167 --> 45:48.833
The Judge in the Kemper trial.

45:48.833 --> 45:51.167
You think they're related?

45:53.267 --> 45:54.933
Stone, oh fuck me.

45:58.433 --> 46:02.600
Chief prosecutor in the
Kemper trial was called Stone.

46:04.167 --> 46:05.233
Philip Stone.

46:08.433 --> 46:11.433
(suspenseful music)

46:33.000 --> 46:37.167
(growling)
(sinister laughing)

46:55.533 --> 46:58.133
(phone ringing)

47:09.767 --> 47:11.933
(mumbles)

47:24.633 --> 47:27.133
(eerie music)

47:35.333 --> 47:38.000
(phone ringing)

47:45.100 --> 47:48.033
(thunder rumbling)

47:51.133 --> 47:53.333
What the fuck is going on?

47:53.333 --> 47:56.600
I think you should
come and see this.

48:15.967 --> 48:18.233
(growling)

48:31.500 --> 48:33.500
[Kemper] Nick Holland.

48:37.133 --> 48:39.400
(growling)

48:49.300 --> 48:53.467
(cat shrieking)
(growling)

49:02.500 --> 49:04.667
(mumbles)

49:07.000 --> 49:09.933
(knife squelching)

49:53.967 --> 49:55.367
Sit down, Pete.

49:59.567 --> 50:02.400
We've got the lab report.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.333
You're not gonna like it.

50:04.333 --> 50:08.000
The fingerprint on the
medallion is Kemper's.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.300
You're having a fucking
laugh, aren't you sir?

50:10.300 --> 50:11.933
I wish I was, Pete.

50:11.933 --> 50:13.967
But the labs are 100% sure.

50:13.967 --> 50:15.667
It's Kemper's.

50:15.667 --> 50:16.600
Bullocks.

50:17.767 --> 50:19.333
I've spoken to Dr.
Ross at the hospital.

50:19.333 --> 50:22.400
Dr. Ross, she's
a stupid cunt, sir.

50:22.400 --> 50:23.367
Don't listen to her.

50:23.367 --> 50:24.600
All right, Pete.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.233
I won't listen to her.

50:26.233 --> 50:28.300
I'll listen to you.

50:28.300 --> 50:30.400
Now tell me about Kemper.

50:32.133 --> 50:35.267
They say he can
control people's minds.

50:35.267 --> 50:36.200
Bullocks.

50:37.733 --> 50:41.400
They say that to keep
him in their hospital.

50:42.567 --> 50:46.467
A mad serial killer's
good for funding.

50:46.467 --> 50:48.300
But Kemper is not mad.

50:49.333 --> 50:51.567
Kemper was a
professional hypnotist.

50:51.567 --> 50:54.133
A travelling stage act.

50:54.133 --> 50:55.967
A clever bastard.

50:55.967 --> 50:58.333
Remember, don't
look in his eyes.

50:58.333 --> 51:00.167
[Pete] He chose his
young victims from

51:00.167 --> 51:02.333
among his audiences.

51:02.333 --> 51:04.533
Hypnotising them on stage,

51:05.900 --> 51:08.633
in front of
unsuspecting parents.

51:10.867 --> 51:14.067
The kids had performed
their funny turn,

51:14.067 --> 51:17.600
then go back to their
seats, unaware of the hidden

51:17.600 --> 51:21.767
phrases that Kemper
had subliminally
planted in their minds.

51:23.133 --> 51:25.367
All he had to do was
telephone the child,

51:25.367 --> 51:29.767
say the trigger word, and
the child would come to him.

51:29.767 --> 51:32.800
Kemper's reign for
abduction and terror lasted

51:32.800 --> 51:33.967
over 25 years.

51:37.233 --> 51:39.733
For every rape and murder he
was eventually charged with,

51:39.733 --> 51:42.233
there must be countless more.

51:42.233 --> 51:46.067
He used the children in
sick depraved rituals.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.667
(mumbles)

51:51.033 --> 51:54.467
Trying to emulate his father,
infamous '30s satanist

51:54.467 --> 51:58.200
Anthony Crawling, but whereas
his father's dabblings

51:58.200 --> 52:02.700
in the (mumbles) brought him
fame, fortune and success.

52:02.700 --> 52:05.833
Kemper's activities
got him nothing.

52:05.833 --> 52:08.467
Not the power he craved.

52:08.467 --> 52:12.200
Just an ever increasing
pile of bodies.

52:12.200 --> 52:14.667
Kemper turned to cannibalism.

52:14.667 --> 52:16.067
To get rid of the evidence.

52:16.067 --> 52:19.733
Search every inch
of this stinking cell.

52:19.733 --> 52:21.667
But his appetite for
murder overtook his appetite

52:21.667 --> 52:23.000
for human flesh.

52:24.800 --> 52:29.700
And a neighbour reported the
foul smell of uneaten remains.

52:29.700 --> 52:31.867
Let me talk to Kemper, sir.

52:31.867 --> 52:34.700
I'll get you some
fucking answers.

52:35.733 --> 52:38.500
(dramatic music)

53:20.533 --> 53:23.000
* La la la la la.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.800
Where'd you get that from?

53:25.800 --> 53:27.367
(mumbles)

53:27.367 --> 53:28.200
Yeah?

53:28.200 --> 53:29.600
Is it good stuff?

53:31.900 --> 53:33.733
[Natalie] Here we go, baby.

53:33.733 --> 53:36.333
(upbeat music)

53:49.233 --> 53:50.333
Is that good?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.267
Give me some more of that.

54:00.700 --> 54:02.467
(car horn honking)

54:02.467 --> 54:03.700
Fucking wanker.

54:07.933 --> 54:12.100
(mumbles) got
any spare change?

54:20.533 --> 54:22.067
Hey!

54:22.067 --> 54:23.233
Fucking trash!

54:35.000 --> 54:36.433
[Natalie] Nick!

54:39.667 --> 54:41.533
[Nick] Jesus fucking!

54:41.533 --> 54:43.033
[Natalie] Jesus!

54:44.800 --> 54:46.000
Fucking Christ!

54:46.000 --> 54:48.667
You've gotta
have a look, Nick.

55:04.933 --> 55:06.267
Not a scratch.

55:09.867 --> 55:12.467
(upbeat music)

55:42.800 --> 55:45.467
(sensual music)

57:59.033 --> 57:59.867
I can't.

58:03.500 --> 58:05.667
It doesn't matter to me.

58:07.833 --> 58:09.167
It does to me.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
(suspenseful music)

58:42.467 --> 58:45.067
I didn't say it
wasn't possible, Nick.

58:45.067 --> 58:46.400
Just unfeasible.

58:47.433 --> 58:49.600
What is it you want, Doc?

58:49.600 --> 58:50.900
A hundred grand?

58:50.900 --> 58:52.167
Two?

58:52.167 --> 58:54.900
Yes, I would need
a lot of money, but,

58:54.900 --> 58:58.067
you tell me, where
do I get a leg from?

58:59.800 --> 59:01.167
Maybe you know a shop
where they sell them,

59:01.167 --> 59:02.833
I'm afraid I do not.

59:04.300 --> 59:08.267
But if you had a leg, it
would be possible, right?

59:09.500 --> 59:12.133
Well, if you got a leg.

59:12.133 --> 59:13.867
It would be possible.

59:25.833 --> 59:26.667
Thomas.

59:28.100 --> 59:30.367
It's Nick, yeah, that Nick.

59:31.933 --> 59:33.200
I know, a year.

59:34.667 --> 59:37.067
Two years, my how time flies.

59:38.833 --> 59:41.700
No, no, yeah that's okay.

59:41.700 --> 59:44.367
Listen, you still live alone?

59:44.367 --> 59:45.600
Yup, no reason.

59:49.100 --> 59:50.600
Yeah.

59:50.600 --> 59:54.567
Just something you might be
able to help me out with.

59:54.567 --> 59:55.400
Yeah.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.667
(mumbles)

59:58.667 --> 01:00:01.867
Okay, I'll pop around tomorrow.

01:00:01.867 --> 01:00:04.700
Okay, all right,
see you tomorrow.

01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:09.700
Which is your favourite?

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.467
The one I lost
in the accident.

01:00:22.567 --> 01:00:25.567
(heavy metal music)

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.533
(elevator buzzing)

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.267
(upbeat music drowns out lyrics)

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.267
(knocking)

01:02:02.267 --> 01:02:06.367
(upbeat music drowns out lyrics)

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:15.167
Thomas?

01:02:15.167 --> 01:02:16.100
How's Trix?

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.767
What do you want, Nick?

01:02:18.767 --> 01:02:21.000
That's no way to greet
no mate, now is it?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.900
I don't hang out with
the old crowd anymore.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.367
That's good, because I've
got a little job that I

01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:28.300
don't want the old
crowd to know about.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.733
Know what I mean?

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.067
It's a nice little earner.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.467
Come on in.

01:02:41.567 --> 01:02:43.400
[Nick] (mumbles) Thomas.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.667
Yeah.

01:02:44.667 --> 01:02:46.500
So what's this job then?

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.267
So impatient.

01:02:48.267 --> 01:02:50.067
Don't I get a cup of tea?

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:51.533
No, what's this job?

01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:53.167
What is it, a robbery?

01:02:53.167 --> 01:02:54.567
Of sorts.

01:02:54.567 --> 01:02:56.967
Yeah, so where
do I come in then?

01:02:56.967 --> 01:02:59.867
You've got
something that I want.

01:02:59.867 --> 01:03:00.933
Yeah, what?

01:03:02.467 --> 01:03:04.467
You're standing on it.

01:03:07.933 --> 01:03:10.267
Not the fucking rug, Thomas.

01:03:12.267 --> 01:03:13.100
Your leg.

01:03:14.633 --> 01:03:17.100
What do you mean, my leg?

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.900
Exactly what I said.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.800
Now Nick, don't
fuck about, mate.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.567
I want your fucking leg.

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:24.400
[Thomas] Nick, no...

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400
(gun shot blasting)

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.400
(suspenseful music)

01:03:45.133 --> 01:03:46.633
All right, then.

01:03:49.133 --> 01:03:52.033
(flesh squelching)

01:05:15.967 --> 01:05:17.900
Good evening, Nick.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.367
Do you have an appointment?

01:05:20.367 --> 01:05:21.200
No.

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:23.567
Better than that.

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:40.033
(moaning)

01:05:44.967 --> 01:05:47.200
What the fuck's going on?

01:05:49.033 --> 01:05:50.133
Who's she?

01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:53.400
It's okay (mumbles).

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
(screaming)

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.533
Surprise!

01:05:57.533 --> 01:05:59.500
Oh my God, Nick.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.300
What have you done?

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.200
Is it real?

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.367
Ah!

01:06:03.367 --> 01:06:05.733
Nat, calm down now.

01:06:05.733 --> 01:06:07.200
It's not what you think.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.333
You remember the doctor
I told you about?

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.100
Oh Christ, Nick, please.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.400
It's what we've always wanted.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.233
I'm a whole man again.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.600
Who's leg is it?

01:06:19.967 --> 01:06:20.967
It's mine.

01:06:22.133 --> 01:06:24.700
(upbeat music)

01:06:38.633 --> 01:06:41.300
(intense music)

01:06:42.867 --> 01:06:45.200
(screaming)

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.500
(suspenseful music)

01:07:49.067 --> 01:07:49.900
Natalie!

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.300
Nat!

01:07:56.367 --> 01:07:57.333
Natalie, no.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.133
No, no.

01:08:00.533 --> 01:08:01.367
Oh no, no!

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.967
(yelling)

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:10.933
Nat!

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.033
Shh.

01:08:14.367 --> 01:08:15.200
Okay.

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:22.800
Okay.

01:08:30.133 --> 01:08:32.733
(upbeat music)

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.533
* Gonna kiss you
like a sledge hammer

01:08:48.533 --> 01:08:50.933
* Love you like a rollercoaster

01:08:50.933 --> 01:08:53.767
* Warm you like a flame thrower

01:08:53.767 --> 01:08:56.933
* I'll take you far
I'm gonna drill you

01:08:56.933 --> 01:08:58.500
* Like an egg souffle

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.733
* Touch you like a close shave

01:09:00.733 --> 01:09:03.700
* So welcome to my strange day

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.300
* When I will take you far

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:11.167
* I'm gonna give you
my heartbreaking love

01:09:11.167 --> 01:09:15.332
* I'm gonna give you
my heartbreaking love

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:20.367
* I'm gonna give you
my heartbreaking love

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.966
* Tease you like a (mumbles)

01:09:27.966 --> 01:09:30.667
* Stroke you like a sidewinder

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:31.500
* Hug you...

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.667
(moaning)

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.033
Well done, oh baby.

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.600
Oh!

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.700
Not now, Nat.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.000
I want it to be perfect.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.667
Well in that case.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:50.600
You better start running, boy.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.367
Hey, come back.

01:09:52.367 --> 01:09:54.100
Bring that back.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:54.933
Natalie.

01:09:58.033 --> 01:10:01.967
* Breaking love, breaking love.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:05.633
Come on baby, take it.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.867
Your carriage awaits, my love.

01:10:22.867 --> 01:10:24.533
Why thank you sir.

01:10:34.733 --> 01:10:37.833
(lively piano music)

01:10:55.467 --> 01:10:57.667
(upbeat music)

01:10:57.667 --> 01:10:59.133
Where we going?

01:10:59.133 --> 01:11:01.300
How does the honeymoon
suite at the Ritz sound?

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.133
Perfect.

01:11:04.767 --> 01:11:06.333
Get the coke.

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:08.333
In the back, in the bag.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.767
In the back, fucking hell.

01:11:15.533 --> 01:11:16.800
What was that?

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.133
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

01:11:27.133 --> 01:11:27.967
Ow.

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:30.967
Ow!

01:11:30.967 --> 01:11:31.800
Ah!

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:44.500
(tyres screeching)
(yelling)

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:17.767
Fuck, Nat.

01:12:26.433 --> 01:12:28.767
(screaming)

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.100
(mumbles) receiving 6055.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.300
(mumbles)

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.300
Personal injury, Chester Road.

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.567
Young female.

01:12:55.567 --> 01:12:57.200
Ambulance required.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.533
(radio voices mumbling)

01:13:15.567 --> 01:13:16.633
Excuse me sir, do you...

01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:19.000
(flesh squelching)

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.233
(yelling)

01:13:21.233 --> 01:13:23.067
It won't die.

01:13:23.067 --> 01:13:23.967
Oh Jesus!

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:27.600
(gurgling)

01:13:36.733 --> 01:13:38.567
Receiving 6055.

01:13:38.567 --> 01:13:42.400
(mumbles) to receiving, 6055.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.000
Chester Road.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.400
[Man] That's exactly
where we're going.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.367
Extra assistance required.

01:13:52.367 --> 01:13:55.067
(radio voices mumbling)

01:13:55.067 --> 01:13:56.300
Move along sir,
there's nothing to see.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:58.433
(yelling)

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.833
(gurgling)

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.100
Over there, lift the toilet.

01:14:50.567 --> 01:14:53.900
(police sirens howling)

01:14:58.133 --> 01:15:01.200
What the fuck have I
done to deserve this?

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.867
Inspector Neilson?

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.833
Neilson here.

01:15:11.833 --> 01:15:13.967
[Richard] Hey, listen,
I've just heard from Branson.

01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:16.067
They found a list
in Kemper's cell.

01:15:16.067 --> 01:15:18.000
It confirms it, you were right.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.467
Yeah, I know we just
pulled Nick Holland's body

01:15:21.467 --> 01:15:23.067
out of his Porsche.

01:15:23.067 --> 01:15:26.600
Son of Joseph, the foreman
of the jury on campus trial.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.600
He's on the list.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.100
Who else is on the list?

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.100
[Richard] There's just
one more name, Pete.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.067
Yours.

01:15:32.067 --> 01:15:32.900
Mine?

01:15:36.633 --> 01:15:37.467
My God.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.000
My son.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.400
Richard, I,

01:15:44.533 --> 01:15:45.733
I've got to warn him.

01:15:45.733 --> 01:15:47.233
[Richard] We've
found his house, Pete.

01:15:47.233 --> 01:15:49.667
The line's dead, when was the
last time you spoke to him?

01:15:49.667 --> 01:15:51.333
What do you mean
the line's dead?

01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:53.033
[Richard] I'm
gonna put out an APB.

01:15:53.033 --> 01:15:56.300
When was the last
time you spoke to him?

01:15:57.433 --> 01:15:59.500
Two and half weeks ago.

01:16:02.467 --> 01:16:03.733
He was at work.

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:13.267
(gentle music)

01:16:42.933 --> 01:16:45.367
(chattering)

01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:57.933
[Penny] Guess who?

01:16:57.933 --> 01:16:59.933
Um, Michelle Pfeiffer?

01:17:02.133 --> 01:17:03.733
Wishful thinking.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.300
So, are we still on for tonight?

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.633
Certainly are.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.233
Uh-oh, trouble.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.633
Richard.

01:17:14.633 --> 01:17:15.800
Busy as usual?

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.633
Richard was just giving
me some advice, Mr. Pringle.

01:17:19.633 --> 01:17:21.967
Oh I'm sure he was, Penny.

01:17:23.367 --> 01:17:25.667
This is your third
and final warning.

01:17:25.667 --> 01:17:28.067
We've been monitoring your work.

01:17:28.067 --> 01:17:30.133
I'm compiling a report.

01:17:30.133 --> 01:17:32.233
We know you've been
accessing some rather

01:17:32.233 --> 01:17:34.733
disturbing material.

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:36.467
[Richard] Yes, it's
all in the report.

01:17:36.467 --> 01:17:37.733
[Mr. Pringle] And yet
you have not informed

01:17:37.733 --> 01:17:40.467
our operators of the dangers.

01:17:40.467 --> 01:17:42.700
Yes, yes, Mr. Pringle I
appreciate your concern.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.767
Appreciate this Richard.

01:17:44.767 --> 01:17:47.167
Seven days, one week.

01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:49.500
Your report, my desk, on it.

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:53.200
Final warning, understand?

01:17:58.933 --> 01:18:01.933
Stupid fucking
jordy wet ass cunt.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.500
Oh my God.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.800
Sorry, Penny, you
shouldn't have seen that.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.100
You spend all day
watching that stuff?

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.367
It's just a job,
you get used to it.

01:18:14.367 --> 01:18:15.833
I don't let it affect me.

01:18:15.833 --> 01:18:17.133
Glad to hear it.

01:18:17.133 --> 01:18:19.400
That was horrible.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.400
So, where are you
taking me tonight?

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:25.767
Richard?

01:18:27.967 --> 01:18:29.300
Richard?

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.667
Sorry, Pen, I was miles away.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:34.167
So where are we going then?

01:18:34.167 --> 01:18:36.833
Well I thought maybe an Indian

01:18:38.667 --> 01:18:40.400
and back to (mumbles)
for some coffee.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.833
Coffee at mine, sounds divine.

01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:43.667
Ciao.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.600
(suspenseful music)

01:19:34.633 --> 01:19:36.300
Yes, I fucking do.

01:19:46.733 --> 01:19:47.567
Fuck.

01:19:56.967 --> 01:19:59.300
(screaming)

01:20:32.567 --> 01:20:36.233
So, tell me about the
terrible sites you've seen.

01:20:36.233 --> 01:20:38.067
I don't know about all that.

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:41.300
I've got an incredibly
morbid imagination.

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:43.000
Have you now?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.367
You kept that quiet.

01:20:44.367 --> 01:20:46.300
You dark little maiden.

01:20:48.633 --> 01:20:50.133
So?

01:20:50.133 --> 01:20:50.967
What?

01:20:50.967 --> 01:20:52.233
Are you gonna tell me?

01:20:52.233 --> 01:20:54.100
Or am I gonna have
to read the report?

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.000
Hm, well,

01:20:56.933 --> 01:21:00.933
I could tell you or I
could do better than that.

01:21:01.767 --> 01:21:03.200
I could show you.

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:05.667
Hm.

01:21:12.533 --> 01:21:13.700
(laughing)

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.600
Did you see his face?

01:21:17.667 --> 01:21:19.100
That was classic.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.800
This place is great.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.700
Yeah, it's all right.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.467
So what you wanna do now?

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:31.300
I could think of a few things.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.100
(mumbles)

01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.133
Champagne.

01:21:42.133 --> 01:21:43.700
Champagne?

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.000
Okay.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.733
And, you go upstairs
and then I'll come up

01:21:48.733 --> 01:21:50.667
and meet you up there.

01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:51.667
Go about it.

01:21:53.067 --> 01:21:53.900
Champagne.

01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.000
Champagne.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.800
I need champagne.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.600
Well maybe pa-magne.

01:21:59.100 --> 01:21:59.933
Up here?

01:21:59.933 --> 01:22:00.767
Yeah.

01:22:02.033 --> 01:22:03.367
Watch your step.

01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:08.500
I'll never get upstairs.

01:22:13.033 --> 01:22:14.300
It's dark up here.

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.033
It's all right, it's
just there, keep going.

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:19.033
On the left.

01:22:22.333 --> 01:22:23.167
Yeah.

01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:25.667
In there.

01:22:27.267 --> 01:22:28.100
Good.

01:22:44.967 --> 01:22:46.700
Well the last thing
she said was that she was

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.267
going to a restaurant with him.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.967
But that was three days ago.

01:23:16.433 --> 01:23:19.433
(door bell ringing)

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.167
Penny!

01:23:27.033 --> 01:23:29.167
Penny, love you all right?

01:23:29.167 --> 01:23:30.467
Penny, it's Mary from work.

01:23:30.467 --> 01:23:33.200
We're all very
worried about you.

01:23:38.367 --> 01:23:42.567
(gasping) Oh my God,
Penny, what happened?

01:23:42.567 --> 01:23:44.100
What's he been
saying about me?

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.100
Nothing, nobody's been
saying anything about you.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:47.500
Look, Penny, let me in.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.767
Tell them I'm never
going back, ever.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.667
(sinister whispering)

01:24:49.067 --> 01:24:51.800
(dramatic music)

01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:23.800
Please don't do this to me.

01:25:30.533 --> 01:25:31.367
Oh fuck.

01:25:34.767 --> 01:25:37.767
(suspenseful music)

01:25:47.567 --> 01:25:50.900
(police sirens howling)

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:13.600
Richard?

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.067
A word.

01:26:15.067 --> 01:26:17.900
Mary from (mumbles) cam
to see me this morning.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.100
Uh-huh.

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:20.767
She saw Penny
Marshall last night.

01:26:20.767 --> 01:26:22.667
She said the girl's
in an awful state.

01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:24.767
Refusing to come back to work.

01:26:24.767 --> 01:26:25.600
And?

01:26:26.767 --> 01:26:29.267
What the hell's that
got to do with me?

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:31.600
I don't know, you tell me.

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:35.533
Richard.

01:27:35.533 --> 01:27:37.167
Yeah, I can hear you,
Pringle, what is it?

01:27:37.167 --> 01:27:39.833
This extra screen, not
really conducive with our

01:27:39.833 --> 01:27:42.933
company's policy of open
working environment.

01:27:42.933 --> 01:27:46.167
This company policy
is a load of ass.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.233
[Mr. Pringle] Richard.

01:27:48.233 --> 01:27:50.967
I strongly advice you
move this partition.

01:27:50.967 --> 01:27:53.667
Or I'll be forced to
take extreme measures.

01:27:53.667 --> 01:27:54.967
Fuck your extreme measures.

01:27:54.967 --> 01:27:57.600
Fuck your company, and fuck you.

01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:16.333
There she is.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:18.067
There she fucking is.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.800
Yeah.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.633
Splendid.

01:28:55.567 --> 01:28:56.733
What the fuck!

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:00.633
You are so fired.

01:29:00.633 --> 01:29:02.600
Get your things
and get out and go.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.200
You'll be paid till
the end of the month.

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.200
Reasons for your dismissal
will be available

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.567
on written request.

01:29:07.567 --> 01:29:08.733
Written request?

01:29:08.733 --> 01:29:10.800
Shove it up your ass!

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.133
Don't be ridiculous Richard.

01:29:12.133 --> 01:29:14.400
(thudding)

01:29:20.467 --> 01:29:21.300
Fuck!

01:29:47.767 --> 01:29:49.333
Fucking changed it.

01:29:52.833 --> 01:29:55.767
(glass shattering)

01:30:18.267 --> 01:30:21.433
(sinister whispering)

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.233
Thank you.

01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:12.967
Thank you, thank you.

01:31:24.567 --> 01:31:26.033
I did nothing wrong!

01:31:26.033 --> 01:31:29.100
For fuck's sake,
please let me out.

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.333
(laughing)

01:31:35.067 --> 01:31:35.900
Please!

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:37.933
Let me out.

01:32:28.533 --> 01:32:30.500
Oh, thank God.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.300
Listen, you gotta get
me out of here please.

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:34.133
Ah!

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.867
Fuck, fuck.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:38.833
Ah!

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.833
Ah!

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.433
(thudding)

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.533
(laughing)

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.200
Wha, wha, what the fuck?

01:33:47.733 --> 01:33:48.967
Fuck, fuck off!

01:33:50.467 --> 01:33:51.300
You fuck!

01:33:53.867 --> 01:33:55.267
Fuck you!

01:33:55.267 --> 01:33:56.100
Fuck you!

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.233
You fucking denied me!

01:34:01.433 --> 01:34:03.600
(sobbing)

01:34:13.233 --> 01:34:14.233
You deny me!

01:34:17.267 --> 01:34:18.667
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:34:25.167 --> 01:34:26.067
Bailiffs.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.233
(growling)

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.600
(eerie music)

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.767
(moaning)

01:36:30.767 --> 01:36:33.233
Somebody somewhere
knows where you are.

01:36:33.233 --> 01:36:34.067
Sorry?

01:36:57.733 --> 01:36:58.900
Speak to me.

01:36:59.767 --> 01:37:02.333
(upbeat music)

01:37:47.933 --> 01:37:48.867
[Man] Come on, mate.

01:37:48.867 --> 01:37:50.100
Your time's up.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:53.767
I should have been out
of here 10 minutes ago.

01:38:19.267 --> 01:38:22.167
Black coffee, five sugars.

01:38:22.167 --> 01:38:24.767
(gentle music)

01:38:54.067 --> 01:38:54.833
Hey!

01:38:57.767 --> 01:39:00.767
(suspenseful music)

01:40:14.267 --> 01:40:16.500
(growling)

01:40:35.533 --> 01:40:38.700
(sinister whispering)

01:41:19.067 --> 01:41:21.567
(dog barking)

01:41:28.933 --> 01:41:31.200
(growling)

01:41:36.067 --> 01:41:39.233
(sinister whispering)

01:41:42.667 --> 01:41:45.433
(dramatic music)

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.867
(knocking)

01:42:34.267 --> 01:42:35.833
What do you want?

01:42:43.267 --> 01:42:46.000
I want to know
about the sick room.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.767
Oh you mean that
internet thing?

01:42:48.767 --> 01:42:50.433
You know about it.

01:42:52.067 --> 01:42:54.067
Can't say I do.

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.533
But I know of a guy.

01:42:55.533 --> 01:42:58.200
Big area on my roof, outside.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.800
Loads of cables, there's
fucking boxes, you know,

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.933
I mean, all in the
spare room at the back.

01:43:04.933 --> 01:43:09.667
But they said it was a
prime location, they did.

01:43:09.667 --> 01:43:10.900
Who are they?

01:43:13.267 --> 01:43:14.867
Can't say I know.

01:43:15.867 --> 01:43:18.500
Some (mumbles).

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.967
If I offered you good money.

01:43:20.967 --> 01:43:22.867
But there was (mumbles).

01:43:22.867 --> 01:43:26.133
Because they said this
was the best spot to be in

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:27.967
for all the equipment.

01:43:28.967 --> 01:43:30.967
This equipment, where is it?

01:43:30.967 --> 01:43:32.400
I want to see it.

01:43:35.033 --> 01:43:37.533
You work for the government?

01:43:40.267 --> 01:43:41.933
What do you think?

01:43:41.933 --> 01:43:46.100
This day in the government,
nothing would surprise me.

01:43:47.467 --> 01:43:50.467
Why don't you
show me, little man?

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:57.600
Follow me.

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:11.667
Straight through this door here.

01:44:11.667 --> 01:44:13.900
Right to the far end,
straight through that door

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:14.833
down there.

01:44:22.333 --> 01:44:25.067
There's a door at the back,
and in there is a light switch.

01:44:25.067 --> 01:44:27.633
Go straight in there,
and you'll find it.

01:44:27.633 --> 01:44:29.133
Where abouts, straight on?

01:44:29.133 --> 01:44:31.333
Yes, straight there.

01:44:31.333 --> 01:44:33.867
You'll be all right, careful.

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:36.067
Straight through there.

01:44:36.067 --> 01:44:38.133
You'll find the light
switch down there.

01:44:38.133 --> 01:44:39.467
Watch your head.

01:44:41.033 --> 01:44:44.700
I'm having a cup of
tea, would you like one?

01:44:50.733 --> 01:44:53.400
Where'd you say the light was?

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.167
Fuck!

01:45:04.167 --> 01:45:05.100
No, no, no!

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:08.100
Fuck let me out!

01:45:09.433 --> 01:45:10.967
Fuck no!

01:45:10.967 --> 01:45:11.867
Let me out!

01:45:20.533 --> 01:45:23.233
No, you made a fuckin' mistake.

01:45:23.233 --> 01:45:25.800
(yelling)

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.100
Ah!

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.000
Fuck, no, fuck!

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:29.833
Ah!

01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:33.233
(screaming)

01:45:55.133 --> 01:45:56.800
Yes, I understand.

01:45:59.667 --> 01:46:00.500
Yes.

01:46:09.333 --> 01:46:10.667
I'll inform him.

01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:21.867
They've identified a body
found in Bromley yesterday.

01:46:24.633 --> 01:46:26.533
Your son is dead.

01:46:26.533 --> 01:46:28.767
(laughing)

01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:44.200
What the hell's he doing here?

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.600
Cell's a little bit
untidy at the moment.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.367
There's no where
else to put him.

01:46:58.867 --> 01:47:01.767
(metal screeching)

01:47:03.367 --> 01:47:06.367
(suspenseful music)

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.933
(doorbell ringing)

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:21.433
Hello?

01:48:26.233 --> 01:48:27.067
Hello?

01:48:31.933 --> 01:48:32.767
Hello?

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:48.333
Hello?

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.433
(bones cracking)

01:49:36.767 --> 01:49:40.033
What do you think
you're doing, Pete?

01:49:43.267 --> 01:49:47.433
What I should have done years
ago when I had the chance.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:54.500
I'm gonna kill him.

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:59.033
I can't let you do that, Pete.

01:49:59.033 --> 01:49:59.867
I know.

01:50:03.633 --> 01:50:04.633
I won't ask.

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:08.567
(thudding)

01:50:10.533 --> 01:50:11.867
Sleep well, now.

01:50:13.267 --> 01:50:15.833
(upbeat music)

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.367
(mumbles)

01:50:27.933 --> 01:50:30.233
[Man] (mumbles) It's
pushing me to the edge.

01:50:30.233 --> 01:50:34.000
And I don't know if it's
Lucifer himself or what.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
But he selected a lot (mumbles).

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.033
It's damaging their brains.

01:50:39.033 --> 01:50:41.633
(upbeat music)

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:10.500
[Dr. Ross] I don't think
you understand, Inspector.

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.367
Kemper is not in a secure zone.

01:51:13.367 --> 01:51:14.900
And until the patient
returns to his room,

01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:19.100
I cannot authorise any
interviews whatsoever.

01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:22.600
[Pete] I don't think
you understand, Dr. Ross.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:27.167
Your patient is involved
in a murdering query.

01:51:27.167 --> 01:51:30.400
I'm aware of that,
Inspector, but rules are rules.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.667
You'll have to wait until
Kemper's returned to his room.

01:51:33.667 --> 01:51:36.167
You're just buying
time, aren't you?

01:51:36.167 --> 01:51:39.500
Roper's spoken to
you, hasn't he?

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.767
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:51:41.767 --> 01:51:44.133
I don't like
being messed about.

01:51:44.133 --> 01:51:45.333
I'm not messing...

01:51:45.333 --> 01:51:47.900
Shooting you
means nothing to me.

01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:51.833
Understand?

01:51:53.767 --> 01:51:55.633
I think so, yes, yes.

01:51:57.867 --> 01:52:00.333
Keep your arms by your side.

01:52:00.333 --> 01:52:03.000
Walk slowly, and take me to him.

01:52:05.167 --> 01:52:06.000
Now!

01:52:07.233 --> 01:52:10.000
(dramatic music)

01:52:37.067 --> 01:52:39.833
Brian, this is
Inspector Neilson.

01:52:39.833 --> 01:52:42.100
He's here to interview Kemper.

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.733
Open the door.

01:52:43.733 --> 01:52:45.667
If you're sure, Dr. Ross.

01:52:45.667 --> 01:52:46.600
I'm sure.

01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:15.533
Neilson?

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:20.000
So nice of you to
make it, Inspector.

01:53:22.533 --> 01:53:25.433
That's Detective Inspector.

01:53:25.433 --> 01:53:27.767
Your arrest got me promoted.

01:53:28.767 --> 01:53:30.700
Well good for you.

01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:31.767
Get the spare key!

01:53:31.767 --> 01:53:33.500
Get security, now go!

01:53:35.333 --> 01:53:36.233
Sit down.

01:53:38.533 --> 01:53:42.300
I take it you know about
your boy (laughing)...

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.200
(gun shot blasting)

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.800
I said, sit down.

01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:52.100
A gun, I underestimated
you, Inspector.

01:53:53.667 --> 01:53:55.700
But it won't be
enough to save you.

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.767
You're talking crap, Kemper.

01:53:58.767 --> 01:54:00.767
Haven't they taught
you anything?

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:02.567
I teach them, Inspector.

01:54:02.567 --> 01:54:04.033
Like I'm going to teach you.

01:54:04.033 --> 01:54:07.500
You and all those
other sceptics!

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.600
Teach me how to
scream like a baby!

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:10.933
(gun shot blasting)

01:54:10.933 --> 01:54:11.767
Ah!

01:54:13.933 --> 01:54:16.467
You never believed in my powers.

01:54:16.467 --> 01:54:18.700
And my father's powers.

01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:21.300
You never believed in evil.

01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:23.500
Only the evil I can destroy.

01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:26.500
(gun shot blasting)

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:33.800
That's where you're
wrong, Inspector.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.467
You can't kill evil.

01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.600
Watch me.

01:54:40.933 --> 01:54:43.933
(gun shot blasting)

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.100
Let me go you bastard,
he's not dead!

01:54:51.033 --> 01:54:51.967
You shot him.

01:54:51.967 --> 01:54:53.600
Let me finish him!

01:54:55.267 --> 01:54:57.867
Take that madman out of here.

01:55:00.033 --> 01:55:02.433
Don't just stand there Brian.

01:55:02.433 --> 01:55:06.600
(intense music)
(knife squelching)

01:56:04.833 --> 01:56:07.000
(moaning)

01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.300
My father would have
been proud of you, my son.

01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:14.433
His power lives on in you.

01:56:14.433 --> 01:56:15.933
Shh.

01:56:15.933 --> 01:56:20.333
Rest now, father, for our
journey has just begun.

01:56:20.333 --> 01:56:23.167
(gun shot blasting)

01:56:23.167 --> 01:56:24.000
No!

01:56:26.633 --> 01:56:28.800
(sobbing)

01:56:33.167 --> 01:56:36.567
Not so fucking
powerful now, is he, eh?

01:56:37.533 --> 01:56:39.867
Not so fucking evil now, eh?

01:56:40.967 --> 01:56:43.033
What do you say?

01:56:43.033 --> 01:56:43.867
Oh no!

01:56:46.067 --> 01:56:48.233
Come on, big man.

01:56:48.233 --> 01:56:50.833
Hypnotise me why don't you?

01:56:50.833 --> 01:56:52.800
Put a spell on me.

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:55.933
Show me your powers, come on!

01:56:55.933 --> 01:56:56.833
I dare you!

01:56:58.267 --> 01:57:01.133
Evil will destroy you,
Inspector, when you least

01:57:01.133 --> 01:57:04.300
expect it, and then
you will believe...

01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:07.300
(gun shot blasting)

01:57:13.667 --> 01:57:14.633
Jesus!

01:57:14.633 --> 01:57:15.633
Don't shoot!

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:17.833
It's over.

01:57:19.333 --> 01:57:20.733
Put the gun down.

01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:24.033
He's dead.

01:57:25.067 --> 01:57:26.467
Everybody's dead.

01:57:28.267 --> 01:57:29.933
Not till I'm sure.

01:58:11.233 --> 01:58:12.233
It's over.

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:15.500
(yelling)

01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:17.333
Evil has just begun!

01:58:20.067 --> 01:58:22.333
(gurgling)

01:58:29.067 --> 01:58:32.200
(gun shots blasting)

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.367
(yelling)

01:58:43.867 --> 01:58:46.467
(upbeat music)

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:05.133
[Man] (mumbles) in this life.

01:59:05.133 --> 01:59:07.967
I know it's pushing
me to the edge.

01:59:07.967 --> 01:59:10.633
And I don't know if
it's Lucifer himself

01:59:10.633 --> 01:59:14.900
or what, but he's
collected (mumbles).

01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:16.633
And he's damaging their brains.

01:59:16.633 --> 01:59:19.200
(upbeat music)
