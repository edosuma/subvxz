Means he didn't have his hands down.

-Yeah, I found blood on the roof.

We know who killed her.

There's gotta be a connection.

16:50.041 --> 16:53.958
-You still wanna do this?
-Yes. Yes, of course. I do, I wanna go.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.416
We're talking one week,

16:56.250 --> 16:58.958
do a little tikkun olam.

16:59.041 --> 17:01.083
-[chuckles]
-Make Rabbi Rachel happy.

17:01.166 --> 17:04.166
I know, I know. I'm totally into it.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.458
Should I buy the plane tickets or what?

17:07.250 --> 17:08.250
I, um...

17:09.500 --> 17:11.666
Do I have to decide this right now?

17:15.250 --> 17:16.125
Nope.

17:16.916 --> 17:22.500
I have to get to the county recorder's
office before it closes.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.458
Sorry.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500

[door opens]

17:32.125 --> 17:33.208
[door closes]

17:35.833 --> 17:39.541
I'm sorry. I don't have any record
of that student's attendance.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.041
[woman] Look, I'm sorry,

17:44.125 --> 17:47.250
but if her name's not here,
I wouldn't know where else to look.

17:56.833 --> 17:57.750
[woman] I'm sorry.

17:58.541 --> 18:02.916
I've been teaching here 15 years,
I've never met any Danielle Wexler.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.541
Okay, let's start
the jump combination, guys.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.791
Five, six... Five, six, seven, eight.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.666
Now tell me about Danielle Azulai.

18:30.458 --> 18:33.041
-What is there to tell?
-Just tell me what you know.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.958
A dancer at Batsheva, we had an affair...

18:38.833 --> 18:41.208
She died in a hit-and-run.
That's all I got.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.666
How did you meet?

18:44.916 --> 18:48.375
At this thing, a fundraising thing
for her dance company.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.583
How?

18:51.291 --> 18:52.916
A friend introduced us.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.708
Was this your only affair?

19:03.125 --> 19:04.750
Were there other dancers?

19:05.875 --> 19:07.375
-Yeah.
-How many?

19:08.666 --> 19:09.666
Dancers?

19:12.291 --> 19:13.166
Five.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.666
Pssh!

19:16.166 --> 19:17.166
You're good.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.416
Does your wife know about
all these, uh, affairs?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.166
Yeah.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.166
Wow. So your wife can sleep
with other men?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.208
Tit for tat, huh?

19:45.666 --> 19:46.583
So...

19:49.125 --> 19:50.541
was there anything...

19:52.041 --> 19:56.208
unusual with the affair with Danielle?

19:59.541 --> 20:00.708
She had a husband.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.166
The entire length of the affair?

20:03.916 --> 20:04.791
No.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.666
Did it bother you she got married?

20:17.625 --> 20:19.000
Why did it bother you?

20:27.250 --> 20:28.583
'Cause I was in love.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.666
Sorry, I'm not seeing that name
in our system.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.208
Think about it for a minute, man.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.666
-Did she ever mention her high school?
-No.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.625
-Any of her New York friends ever visit?
-No.

20:56.583 --> 20:57.958
Do you know if she's...?

20:58.041 --> 20:59.625
I don't know and I never asked.

20:59.708 --> 21:02.666
It was none of my business.
Even if I asked her, she wouldn't tell me.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.333
Wait a sec.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
[suspenseful music playing]

21:46.916 --> 21:48.958
[Ron] Who the fuck is Sophie Dreyer?

22:07.333 --> 22:09.166
That's a different name
than you gave me earlier, right?

22:09.250 --> 22:12.250
-Yes.
-But this is your wife too?

22:12.875 --> 22:13.750
Yes.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.208
[typing]

22:16.916 --> 22:17.916
You see her?

22:20.166 --> 22:23.833
Look, man, I'm not supposed
to just give stuff out on students.

22:23.916 --> 22:27.541
And you're definitely not supposed
to just take that off the wall...

22:27.625 --> 22:29.583
I'm asking you for the last time.

22:29.666 --> 22:31.625
Give me that address.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.458
[suspenseful music playing]

22:40.375 --> 22:44.250
Man, I know this is hard, but this all
could just be a huge misunderstanding.

22:44.791 --> 22:47.041
We'll ask a few questions,
you'll feel better,

22:47.125 --> 22:49.458
but you should probably
get home after that.

22:49.541 --> 22:52.250
Ella is waiting for you.
You gotta mourn your loss.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.250
Who cares? So she hid some stuff from you.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.708
-It's not that simple.
-With you, it's never that simple!

22:58.791 --> 23:02.416
Sometimes the truth just ends up
causing more pain.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.708
You never liked her.

23:03.791 --> 23:05.500
She was just too hot for you, man.

23:06.916 --> 23:09.000
What can I say? Out of your league.

23:10.666 --> 23:11.875
There. Stop here.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.250
That's Danielle's house?

23:16.791 --> 23:19.166
It's Sophie's. With her parents.

23:39.208 --> 23:40.416
Nobody's here, man.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.916
Check there. I'll check the back.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.625
-Anything?
-Nope.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.000
-I thought you just wanted to talk.
-Yeah.

24:12.916 --> 24:15.250
I see there's some stuff
you don't forget, huh?

24:56.208 --> 24:57.166
Segev.

24:59.083 --> 24:59.916
What?

25:19.750 --> 25:21.583
I never seen her that small.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.333
She didn't want you to see her.

I don't care
if it's a text from the hospital.

I don't want you to get into an accident!

27:51.375 --> 27:55.125
First, he's not my fishing store buddy.
He's an artist who hand-makes my flies.

[woman] Turn off your phone when driving.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.250
[man] Give me your bag.

If you wanna back-seat drive,
sit in the back seat.

both our lives to text jokes

28:04.041 --> 28:06.208
to your friend while going 60!

28:06.291 --> 28:09.833
I wasn't using my phone
while we were driving. I was stopped.

28:10.541 --> 28:12.166
That's when I was using my phone.

sit in the back.

You suck at fishing.

Have we tried this red?

-Get out of my house.

Hello. My wife and I came home,
and we found men broke into my house.

I don't know if they took anything,
but they're running away.

Yes! They're in a green van.
They're heading west!

Have you lost it? You're crazy? He saw us!

It's not like you owe me anything, right?

-Didn't you say we'd burn it?
-No need.

31:34.666 --> 31:37.916
Segev, are you crazy? That cop had
a dash cam. He got us on tape.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.875
Burning the car will just draw
more attention.

31:40.958 --> 31:43.208
We leave it, it will get stripped
for parts. It'll be gone.

31:43.291 --> 31:44.875
Oh, so now your head fucking works?

31:44.958 --> 31:47.250
You couldn't think about that
before they sent the fucking police?

31:47.333 --> 31:50.333
-What's the plan, huh?
-I never asked you to crash that cop car.

31:50.416 --> 31:54.833
No. You just asked me to find Isaac.
I found the guy, but it's not good enough.

31:54.916 --> 31:57.708
So we found the guys he hired,
fucked them up in front of the whole city,

31:57.791 --> 31:58.791
still not good for you!

31:58.875 --> 32:01.083
You turned us into murderers in America!

And you're still not done, huh?

32:03.416 --> 32:06.000
All this is on me?
You're a murderer because of me?

32:06.083 --> 32:06.916
Huh?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.625
In Mexico, we killed people
without knowing their names.

32:09.708 --> 32:11.666
At least here, it's not for a paycheck.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.791
We're friends, huh? My man, huh?

32:15.875 --> 32:18.708
You begged me to come to Mexico,
and I didn't want it.

32:18.791 --> 32:20.083
But I still did it for you!

32:20.666 --> 32:23.458
You got nightmares?
You don't sleep at night? Good.

32:25.166 --> 32:28.291
That's what you get for dragging me
into the fucking nightmare in Mexico.

You're fucking nothing.

and I think we need to speak.

Whoever this Wexler person is, they seem
to have pretty serious resources,

34:28.833 --> 34:33.333
and I don't know what that means entirely
except finding them could piss them off.

34:33.416 --> 34:35.291
So we need to tread carefully.

34:36.333 --> 34:40.083
Call me back ASAP, Segev.

Gotta get to my apartment,
get a few things,

35:25.375 --> 35:27.833
and get out of there, man.
It's too dangerous.

What are you gonna do?

into all of this mess, huh?

every day until she died.

like crazies. Segev, people got killed!

38:36.666 --> 38:38.958
Sophie got married and didn't tell me?

38:39.041 --> 38:40.958
I mean, shit.

38:41.041 --> 38:44.208
It's only been, what,
nine months since she was here.

38:44.291 --> 38:46.083
-Is she here with you?
-No.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.791
I'm alone this time.
But I wanna show you something.

38:50.416 --> 38:53.083
Our pictures from our wedding.
Just a minute.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.583
Oh, she looks glorious.

38:58.583 --> 39:00.250
You couldn't wear a tie?

39:01.583 --> 39:02.583
It was hot.

39:03.791 --> 39:06.583
Well, hold on, we'll get you in.

39:06.666 --> 39:09.458
-I got a spare somewhere.
-Thank you.

39:09.541 --> 39:14.916
Don't usually like illegal subletting,
but Sophie is different.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.541
By the way,
this box came for her last week.

39:17.625 --> 39:20.708
Now, I usually forward her mail
to her parents

39:20.791 --> 39:24.375
'cause she told me to hold on
to all boxes here for her.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.500
-Thank you, Gloria. Thanks a lot.
-Mm-hm.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.916
Good night. Thank you.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.750
[pensive music playing]

41:41.041 --> 41:41.875
[Naomi] Hello?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.333
Naomi.

41:43.416 --> 41:44.666
I know it's late.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.666
No, it's fine. I wanted to talk.

41:46.750 --> 41:51.125
So about the Wexler thing,
it's definitely a fake name.

41:51.208 --> 41:53.333
There's a couple
of Martin Wexlers in New York,

41:53.416 --> 41:56.375
but none with a daughter named Danielle
or a wife named Marcia.

41:57.125 --> 42:00.291
And none of the state IDs matched
the photos of him you sent me.

42:00.375 --> 42:02.125
That does not surprise me.

42:02.208 --> 42:05.875
Yeah, I also got in touch
with the owner of the brownstone.

42:05.958 --> 42:09.083
He remembered the people
that rented for Danielle's memorial.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.625
Said it was a weird one.

42:12.125 --> 42:16.208
The renter asked that the owner's
personal belongings be removed,

42:16.291 --> 42:18.666
even from the non-rented area.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.791
Paid a quadruple rate for it.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.750
The owner helped me track the payment,

42:25.833 --> 42:28.791
but we dead-ended
at some LLC in the Seychelles.

42:29.833 --> 42:30.833
LLC?

42:30.916 --> 42:32.041
They have money.

42:35.166 --> 42:40.291
They're sophisticated. I doubt we'll be
able to track them unless they want us to.

42:44.291 --> 42:45.833
Don't take this the wrong way,

42:45.916 --> 42:47.791
but if your wife knew this person,

42:47.875 --> 42:50.375
it's time
we start investigating your wife.

43:02.583 --> 43:04.208
Let's talk about it tomorrow, okay?

43:05.375 --> 43:07.375
[ominous music playing]

43:28.125 --> 43:30.958
[Tamir] I understand your anger,
but what can we do?

43:32.958 --> 43:34.750
This is the life we chose.

43:37.041 --> 43:39.458
Besides, we're nearly done here.

43:43.375 --> 43:46.083
I believe everything you told me so far
has been true.

43:52.708 --> 43:56.791
I do appreciate your cooperation here,
and I promise I'll pass it along.

44:01.666 --> 44:06.208
I don't know what they're gonna do
with it. I'm not the one who decides.

44:08.625 --> 44:10.166
If you ask me, I think

44:10.250 --> 44:12.250
they'll be impressed with your service.

44:12.625 --> 44:14.708
You've done a lot for your country.

44:20.083 --> 44:21.708
One last question.

44:28.541 --> 44:29.666
You spent...

44:30.416 --> 44:34.166
half of your life
working in intelligence...

44:35.958 --> 44:37.500
How could you not know that...

44:38.916 --> 44:41.291
Danielle Azulai was CIA?
