00:31.184 --> 00:33.000
Hey, Ochoa.

00:33.001 --> 00:34.598
_

00:37.655 --> 00:39.385
_

00:39.793 --> 00:41.194
Texas State Troopers!

00:41.195 --> 00:42.162
Drop your weapons!

00:42.163 --> 00:44.563
Drop 'em!

01:04.818 --> 01:06.283
Banks!

01:06.284 --> 01:07.950
How bad you hit, Banks?

01:17.994 --> 01:20.697
I know you and your son
have been through a lot

01:20.698 --> 01:23.033
these past few months, Mrs. Banks.

01:23.034 --> 01:25.706
Your husband's death
was a terrible tragedy,

01:25.707 --> 01:26.870
and I know that you want

01:26.871 --> 01:28.972
to see the man responsible face justice.

01:28.973 --> 01:30.540
As do I.

01:30.541 --> 01:33.706
Carlos Ochoa has been
apprehended in Mexico,

01:33.707 --> 01:35.708
and they are willing to extradite him.

01:35.709 --> 01:37.042
But they haven't.

01:37.043 --> 01:38.177
As you know,

01:38.178 --> 01:40.813
the sticking point has been
Mexico's standing policy

01:40.814 --> 01:42.515
against extraditing any of its citizens

01:42.516 --> 01:44.083
to a country with the death penalty.

01:44.084 --> 01:47.120
But he's a member of a drug cartel

01:47.121 --> 01:48.121
and a murderer.

01:48.122 --> 01:49.422
What do they care?

01:49.423 --> 01:50.690
He's still a citizen.

01:50.691 --> 01:53.059
And they object to
another country meting out

01:53.060 --> 01:54.260
that kind of justice.

01:54.261 --> 01:57.597
However, if I can get your blessing

01:57.598 --> 01:59.298
to take the death penalty off the table,

01:59.299 --> 02:01.367
I can bring Ochoa Stateside

02:01.368 --> 02:02.835
and have him stand trial.

02:02.836 --> 02:04.937
He could spend the rest
of his life behind bars.

02:04.938 --> 02:06.772
And you're sure?

02:06.773 --> 02:08.940
That he'll get life?

02:10.508 --> 02:13.478
I'm sure that he will get a fair trial.

02:14.580 --> 02:16.582
I can't guarantee the outcome.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.919
But I can assure you that the U.S. attorney

02:19.920 --> 02:22.588
is going to seek the maximum penalty.

02:22.589 --> 02:24.255
He should die.

02:24.924 --> 02:27.226
Sam.

02:27.227 --> 02:30.362
A life behind bars means
he will never be able

02:30.363 --> 02:32.398
to hurt another person ever.

02:32.399 --> 02:34.733
It means another family
won't have to go through

02:34.734 --> 02:37.135
what we're going through because of him.

02:40.673 --> 02:42.007
Okay.

02:42.008 --> 02:44.677
If that's the only way,

02:44.678 --> 02:45.844
then okay.

02:45.845 --> 02:47.313
Mom, this man should have to pa...

02:47.314 --> 02:49.682
No, if he stays in Mexico,
we don't know what'll happen.

02:49.683 --> 02:51.817
They could let him go.

02:51.818 --> 02:54.486
She's saying this is the best thing, and...

02:54.487 --> 02:56.487
we have to trust her.

03:02.427 --> 03:04.295
Thank you.

03:16.975 --> 03:18.310
Time to go.

03:18.311 --> 03:19.945
Ugh, already?

03:19.946 --> 03:21.346
Don't want to miss your plane.

03:21.347 --> 03:23.849
Oh, the plane's not gonna
leave without me, Blake.

03:23.850 --> 03:26.985
You know, I had my heart
set on the train, actually,

03:26.986 --> 03:30.288
but Fred vetoed that
with extreme prejudice.

03:30.289 --> 03:33.058
Why do I get the impression
you're trying to get rid of me?

03:33.059 --> 03:34.750
Because I'm trying to get rid of you.

03:34.751 --> 03:36.361
This is your 25th wedding anniversary.

03:36.362 --> 03:38.497
It's a momentous occasion.

03:38.498 --> 03:41.266
And I promised Dr. McCord I'd
get you out of here on time.

03:41.267 --> 03:42.330
You did?

03:42.331 --> 03:44.057
Well, he warned me that
you always dragged your feet

03:44.058 --> 03:45.036
before taking a vacation.

03:45.037 --> 03:47.038
Even before you were Secretary of State.

03:47.039 --> 03:49.241
And he's expecting Herculean
resistance to this one.

03:49.242 --> 03:51.242
You and Henry talk behind my back?

03:51.243 --> 03:52.577
Frequently.

03:52.578 --> 03:54.211
Let's go.

03:57.882 --> 03:59.217
Okay.

03:59.218 --> 04:00.351
This is it.

04:00.352 --> 04:02.220
I am leaving the building.

04:02.221 --> 04:04.656
So, uh...

04:04.657 --> 04:07.692
Deputy Secretary Cushing
is on call if you need him.

04:07.693 --> 04:10.094
I saw him the other day in the hallway,

04:10.095 --> 04:11.095
and he snubbed me.

04:11.096 --> 04:12.263
Well, maybe he didn't recognize you.

04:12.264 --> 04:13.364
He was acting secretary

04:13.365 --> 04:14.899
for two months after Marsh passed.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.334
We saw each other every day.

04:16.334 --> 04:17.601
He's probably still bitter

04:17.603 --> 04:19.237
because he had to vacate the big chair.

04:19.238 --> 04:20.404
I think he actually believed

04:20.406 --> 04:22.440
he was going to be appointed secretary.

04:22.441 --> 04:23.841
Nope, I think it was personal.

04:23.842 --> 04:25.143
But you think everything is personal.

04:25.144 --> 04:26.310
That does not mean I'm wrong.

04:26.311 --> 04:28.379
Nadine, let's finalize this extradition.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.981
Will you get me an appointment next week

04:29.982 --> 04:31.482
with the, uh, Mexican ambassador?

04:31.483 --> 04:32.650
That's Rafael Lopez.

04:32.651 --> 04:33.684
Oh, thank you, Blake.

04:33.685 --> 04:35.805
I state the obvious because I care.

04:38.156 --> 04:41.225
All right, so I will see you all next week.

04:41.226 --> 04:42.393
And if something comes up...

04:42.394 --> 04:43.893
Nothing will come up.

04:45.129 --> 04:47.064
- But...
- Please leave.

04:47.065 --> 04:48.733
Now.

04:48.734 --> 04:49.967
Leaving.

04:49.968 --> 04:51.702
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

04:51.703 --> 04:52.703
Klaus is clean?

04:52.704 --> 04:54.038
I'm not saying that.

04:54.039 --> 04:55.773
You're my handler. Be straight with me.

04:55.774 --> 04:58.442
The bug you planted came up empty.

04:58.443 --> 05:01.112
Nothing incriminating, just
a lot of PBS and Mozart.

05:01.113 --> 05:03.214
What about his connection to
the Butcher of the Euphrates

05:03.215 --> 05:04.982
and the missing canisters of sarin gas?

05:04.983 --> 05:07.118
That doesn't go away just
because he's smart enough

05:07.119 --> 05:08.652
not to talk shop in his house.

05:08.653 --> 05:10.654
I agree, but to keep the op active,

05:10.655 --> 05:11.956
we need more to go on.

05:11.957 --> 05:13.958
Look, I saw the same Intel that you did.

05:13.959 --> 05:15.926
I am very uncomfortable letting this go.

05:15.927 --> 05:17.761
We don't have a choice.

05:17.762 --> 05:19.597
My bosses have moved on.

05:19.598 --> 05:22.933
Even if Klaus is a threat,
he's not an immediate one.

05:22.934 --> 05:25.970
They have bigger fish to fry.

05:25.971 --> 05:27.605
It's not my call, Henry.

05:27.606 --> 05:30.607
I answer to a chain of command.
I have to trust their judgment.

05:30.608 --> 05:32.476
Klaus is going to Tel Aviv for six months.

05:32.477 --> 05:34.812
They're handing the whole
thing over to Mossad.

05:34.813 --> 05:37.147
This completes your assignment.

05:37.148 --> 05:38.682
Thank you for your service.

05:38.683 --> 05:42.084
We do appreciate your dedication
and everything you risked.

05:43.053 --> 05:44.754
Take care.

05:49.881 --> 05:51.995
I'm heading out to lunch
with Governor Lockwood.

05:51.996 --> 05:53.330
Back in an hour or so.

05:53.331 --> 05:55.365
I didn't realize you and
the governor were so close.

05:55.366 --> 05:56.633
I worked on his first campaign

05:56.634 --> 05:58.201
when he ran for mayor of Galveston

05:58.202 --> 05:59.903
back when I was in college.

06:01.406 --> 06:02.873
A secret Texan.

06:02.874 --> 06:04.074
Born in Connecticut,

06:04.075 --> 06:06.209
but we moved to Dallas when I was a kid.

06:06.210 --> 06:07.744
I fly both flags.

06:07.745 --> 06:09.746
Like a true politician.

06:09.747 --> 06:11.047
What's the lunch about?

06:11.048 --> 06:13.750
He's in town lobbying
Congress for federal funds

06:13.751 --> 06:15.352
to police the U.S./Mexico border,

06:15.353 --> 06:17.554
and, I'm sure, fishing for information

06:17.555 --> 06:18.588
about the extradition.

06:18.589 --> 06:21.224
Opportunity for a little hand-holding.

06:21.225 --> 06:23.526
Well, I thought I'd do
a little multitasking.

06:23.527 --> 06:24.928
Did the trooper's widow sign off?

06:24.929 --> 06:25.895
She did.

06:25.896 --> 06:27.063
Can I tell him that?

06:27.064 --> 06:28.164
You may.

06:28.165 --> 06:29.733
Oh, but be careful with Lockwood.

06:29.734 --> 06:31.101
He's wily.

06:31.102 --> 06:32.369
I know.

06:32.370 --> 06:34.770
I gave him some of his wiliest ideas.

06:39.476 --> 06:42.846
I hate to admit it, but
this steak is pretty good.

06:44.815 --> 06:47.684
One thing I miss most about
Dallas is Denson's downtown.

06:47.685 --> 06:49.552
- Oh...
- Oh.

06:49.553 --> 06:51.754
I feel for you, I do.

06:51.755 --> 06:53.723
Mmm.

06:53.724 --> 06:56.192
I got to say,

06:56.193 --> 06:58.461
you did a job shaving off your accent.

06:58.462 --> 07:00.630
Tell me, is it really gone?

07:00.631 --> 07:03.499
Or do you keep it in your
pocket for when you need it?

07:03.500 --> 07:05.868
Only comes out when I'm
drinking or talking to my mama.

07:05.869 --> 07:08.204
And there are definitely
some crossover moments.

07:09.573 --> 07:11.606
Mmm.

07:13.209 --> 07:15.845
So how'd it go this morning with Congress?

07:15.846 --> 07:17.914
Double-talk.

07:17.915 --> 07:21.317
Turned into triple-talk,
turned into a lot of hot air.

07:21.318 --> 07:22.618
Sorry to hear that.

07:22.619 --> 07:24.320
It's not like I don't have reason

07:24.321 --> 07:25.988
to ask for those funds.

07:25.989 --> 07:28.724
Texas state trooper murdered
right down there on the border.

07:28.725 --> 07:33.228
Now, what further proof do
they need that it's necessary?

07:36.999 --> 07:40.369
So what's the update on the, uh,

07:40.370 --> 07:42.837
extradition of Carlos Ochoa?

07:44.006 --> 07:46.142
Good news, actually.

07:46.143 --> 07:48.310
The secretary received
the family's blessing

07:48.311 --> 07:49.979
to take the death penalty off the table.

07:49.980 --> 07:51.580
We should be able to finalize everything

07:51.581 --> 07:52.848
with Mexico next week.

07:52.849 --> 07:55.217
Well, why is Mexico dictating terms?

07:55.218 --> 07:56.385
Huh?

07:57.654 --> 07:59.688
How does the secretary
agree to such a thing?

07:59.689 --> 08:01.390
Without even consulting me?

08:01.391 --> 08:03.993
If the secretary didn't take
the death penalty off the table,

08:03.994 --> 08:05.294
the extradition would have stalled.

08:05.295 --> 08:07.630
The longer Ochoa stays in Mexico,

08:07.631 --> 08:09.898
the greater the chance he could slip away.

08:09.899 --> 08:12.067
The secretary was thinking
about Trooper Banks' family.

08:12.068 --> 08:14.236
She didn't want to drag
this thing out any longer.

08:14.237 --> 08:16.572
Second-tier justice is still justice.

08:16.573 --> 08:18.574
The family deserves that.

08:18.575 --> 08:21.510
Oh, Jay, you're right.

08:21.511 --> 08:23.512
They shouldn't wait any longer

08:23.513 --> 08:26.915
to see that bastard pay the piper.

08:28.585 --> 08:30.586
Damn.

08:30.587 --> 08:34.188
If you don't have the better
makings of a politician.

08:34.190 --> 08:36.191
I run too hot.

08:36.192 --> 08:37.659
I always have.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.028
Your constituents appreciate your passion.

08:40.029 --> 08:42.464
I do have that going for me.

08:45.334 --> 08:48.070
Just so we're clear

08:48.071 --> 08:49.137
on the rules...

08:49.138 --> 08:51.073
Yes, Mom... no boys, no parties.

08:51.074 --> 08:52.507
- We went over this.
- Yeah, we did,

08:52.508 --> 08:54.509
and then what happened
last time? There was a boy.

08:54.510 --> 08:55.610
Lesson learned.

08:55.611 --> 08:57.279
- Okay.
- No company of any gender.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.980
Think they got it, honey.

08:58.981 --> 09:00.782
Okay, hey, Jason, you've got to finish

09:00.783 --> 09:02.484
your Italian government paper.

09:02.485 --> 09:05.086
And it should not be about how Italy is run

09:05.087 --> 09:06.554
by a Masonic shadow government.

09:06.555 --> 09:08.223
Uh, it is, but...

09:08.224 --> 09:09.858
Okay, okay, okay, I just, oh...

09:09.859 --> 09:11.226
Okay, great. Bye.

09:11.227 --> 09:13.228
Listen, we're gonna be in
New York, so we're nearby.

09:13.229 --> 09:14.896
If something happens, you just call,

09:14.897 --> 09:16.498
and then we just... we'll be right here.

09:16.499 --> 09:17.899
That's weird. Why not go to, like,

09:17.900 --> 09:19.434
Europe or Jamaica or something?

09:19.435 --> 09:20.668
Go big or go home.

09:20.669 --> 09:21.736
It's romantic, doofus.

09:21.737 --> 09:22.804
They went to New York

09:22.805 --> 09:24.139
on their first anniversary.

09:24.140 --> 09:26.741
We are gonna retrace our steps
and stay at the same hotel,

09:26.742 --> 09:28.510
and we're gonna eat at the same restaurant.

09:28.511 --> 09:29.744
The Rue Dix-Sept.

09:29.745 --> 09:32.280
Best cassoulet this side of Paris.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.115
- Where we could be by now
- Yes, I know.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.917
- If we would just go.
- I know, I know.

09:35.918 --> 09:37.318
Oh, hey, listen... Blake is gonna stop by

09:37.319 --> 09:38.386
and check in on you guys.

09:38.387 --> 09:39.754
Why?

09:39.755 --> 09:41.222
- Don't ask that.
- Because Stevie's gonna be

09:41.223 --> 09:43.024
with her college friends in
Wilmington for the weekend

09:43.025 --> 09:43.958
and somebody has to check...

09:43.959 --> 09:45.126
- Okay, Mom, everything...
- Why?!

09:45.127 --> 09:47.528
Because it makes me feel better.

09:47.529 --> 09:49.664
I love you, I do.

09:49.665 --> 09:51.666
Mom, everything is gonna be fine.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.668
Listen, be sure you run the dishwasher.

09:53.669 --> 09:55.103
Otherwise, it starts to smell.

09:55.104 --> 09:56.437
- Bye!
- And, Jason...

09:56.438 --> 09:58.239
just because I'm not riding you about it

09:58.240 --> 09:59.907
doesn't mean that there isn't any garbage.

09:59.908 --> 10:01.209
Be sure and take that out.

10:01.210 --> 10:03.410
And let's not...

10:05.079 --> 10:06.547
Steven.

10:06.548 --> 10:07.748
Hi, Nadine.

10:07.749 --> 10:09.016
Good to see you.

10:09.017 --> 10:10.384
I just wanted to come down

10:10.385 --> 10:11.719
and, uh, check in.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.655
Well, as you can see, it's
a quiet Friday afternoon.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.557
Madam Secretary get away okay?

10:16.558 --> 10:19.727
Yes, uh, Blake actually
finally forced her out the door.

10:20.729 --> 10:21.996
Deputy Secretary Cushing.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.097
Jay, how's it going?

10:23.098 --> 10:24.165
Fine, thanks.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.232
How was your lunch

10:25.233 --> 10:26.634
with Governor Lockwood?

10:26.635 --> 10:29.904
Well, actually, he was unhappy
about not being consulted

10:29.905 --> 10:31.605
regarding the extradition of Ochoa.

10:31.606 --> 10:33.774
I calmed him down, but
it might be a good idea

10:33.775 --> 10:35.342
for Deputy Cushing to give him a call

10:35.343 --> 10:36.710
and make sure he's not making waves.

10:36.711 --> 10:37.878
Not a problem.

10:37.879 --> 10:39.880
Too late.

10:39.881 --> 10:42.216
After the murder of a Texas state trooper,

10:42.217 --> 10:45.119
Congress still refuses to approve funds

10:45.120 --> 10:46.654
for border security with Mexico.

10:46.655 --> 10:49.490
The cartel killer
responsible for the murder

10:49.491 --> 10:52.292
will be extradited to the United States

10:52.293 --> 10:54.228
to stand trial, but I have just learned

10:54.229 --> 10:56.563
that the Justice Department has agreed

10:56.564 --> 10:58.599
to take the death penalty off the table.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.902
Since when does a foreign country

11:01.903 --> 11:03.904
dictate terms to the United States?

11:03.905 --> 11:08.141
As of today, I am deploying the
National Guard to the border.

11:08.142 --> 11:11.011
This is a state issue

11:11.012 --> 11:13.814
as well as a federal one.

11:13.815 --> 11:17.117
A Texas citizen,

11:17.118 --> 11:18.418
Roger Banks...

11:18.419 --> 11:19.820
Secretary of State McCord's office.

11:19.821 --> 11:20.887
...was murdered.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.824
And we will take care of our own.

11:23.825 --> 11:26.492
It's Ambassador Lopez.

11:28.795 --> 11:30.296
What?

11:47.280 --> 11:48.281
It's nobody.

11:48.282 --> 11:50.349
Let's go.

11:51.017 --> 11:52.352
What was that about?

11:52.353 --> 11:54.187
They were expecting somebody famous.

11:54.188 --> 11:55.889
Beyoncé was here last week.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.756
Tough crowd.

12:02.730 --> 12:04.798
Hey, I've got an idea.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.266
Why don't we set some ground rules

12:06.267 --> 12:07.867
for our little stroll down memory lane?

12:07.868 --> 12:09.002
Such as?

12:09.003 --> 12:10.203
We go off the grid.

12:10.204 --> 12:13.273
- No phones, no computers,
- Oh...

12:13.274 --> 12:16.676
no TV, just anything
with an âonâ button.

12:16.677 --> 12:18.244
Look, I know you're nervous

12:18.245 --> 12:20.213
'cause it's your first
time away from the office,

12:20.214 --> 12:21.614
but you've got a great staff.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.783
They wouldn't be working for
you if they weren't great.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.386
So they will find you if
something big comes up.

12:26.387 --> 12:27.887
Okay.

12:27.888 --> 12:29.522
Off the grid, swear.

12:29.523 --> 12:30.556
Off.

12:30.557 --> 12:32.525
Off.

12:32.526 --> 12:34.861
Is Texas a part of the
United States or not?

12:34.862 --> 12:36.396
Mr. Ambassador, this is Governor Lockwood

12:36.397 --> 12:37.663
pulling a political stunt.

12:37.664 --> 12:39.198
I'm sure we can find a solution...

12:39.199 --> 12:41.501
The solution is to remove the
National Guard from the border.

12:41.502 --> 12:43.236
This stunt not only
affects illegal immigration

12:43.237 --> 12:44.504
and drug smuggling;

12:44.505 --> 12:46.239
it also affects legitimate
commercial traffic.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.540
Which will come to a standstill

12:47.541 --> 12:51.043
and cost my country
millions in lost revenue.

12:51.044 --> 12:52.478
Who am I meeting with again?

12:52.479 --> 12:54.647
Deputy Secretary Steven Cushing.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.382
The Secretary of State is too busy.

12:56.383 --> 12:57.783
Oh, she's unavailable.

12:57.784 --> 12:59.585
I'd bet she'd be available

12:59.586 --> 13:01.320
if I call off the extradition of Ochoa.

13:01.321 --> 13:04.857
Mr. Ambassador, let's not do anything rash.

13:04.858 --> 13:08.459
You mean like sending the
National Guard to the border?

13:12.765 --> 13:13.732
Okay, I'm going long.

13:13.733 --> 13:14.767
Really put some muscle into it.

13:14.768 --> 13:16.068
If I break anything, it's your fault.

13:16.069 --> 13:18.070
Uh, I'm gonna catch it unless
you throw it like a girl.

13:18.071 --> 13:20.139
Start moving, big talk.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.341
Hey, guys, it's me.

13:22.342 --> 13:23.242
Oh, h-hey, oh!

13:23.243 --> 13:25.243
Aahh!

13:26.845 --> 13:30.049
Oh, look, champagne and strawberry

13:30.050 --> 13:31.550
and crĂ¨me fraĂŽche.

13:33.086 --> 13:35.054
You are good.

13:35.055 --> 13:36.755
Do you remember what a splurge this was?

13:36.756 --> 13:40.259
Oh, gosh, uh, a hundred bucks
for a bottle of champagne?

13:40.260 --> 13:42.294
I practically had to
breathe into a paper bag.

13:42.295 --> 13:43.395
Remember?

13:43.396 --> 13:46.431
I hardly had enough money to get us home.

13:46.432 --> 13:48.467
This weekend is already perfect.

13:48.468 --> 13:49.401
Scoot.

13:49.402 --> 13:51.570
Well, it's not exactly perfect.

13:51.571 --> 13:54.206
I talked to the concierge.
Neil Patrick Harris is sick.

13:54.207 --> 13:55.541
And his understudy is some kid

13:55.542 --> 13:57.576
from one of those singing
competition things.

13:57.577 --> 13:58.910
- Oh.
- But the good news is...

13:58.911 --> 14:00.712
I got us tickets to a Beckett play.

14:00.713 --> 14:02.748
And, apparently, it is
a raucous masterpiece.

14:02.749 --> 14:05.017
Well, I'm up for a raucous masterpiece.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.151
But how'd you get tickets so late?

14:08.286 --> 14:10.355
Might have had to drop your name.

14:10.356 --> 14:12.357
Oh, well, I hope that that doesn't mean

14:12.358 --> 14:14.292
that some elderly couple
in Peoria got bumped,

14:14.293 --> 14:15.001
No.

14:15.002 --> 14:17.028
Because, I'm telling you,
Daisy's always warning me

14:17.029 --> 14:19.965
that the PR nightmares, they
start with the little things.

14:19.966 --> 14:21.299
Look, I already had to compromise

14:21.300 --> 14:23.068
and get us this huge room.

14:23.069 --> 14:25.270
And I wasn't gonna
compromise on anything else.

14:25.271 --> 14:27.272
You know, Fred had security concerns

14:27.273 --> 14:28.573
about our anniversary room.

14:28.574 --> 14:30.008
This one's better.

14:30.009 --> 14:31.710
But it's not the same room.

14:31.711 --> 14:35.046
Yeah, but on the upside, we get to live.

14:35.047 --> 14:36.448
Why are you being the sentimental one?

14:36.449 --> 14:38.316
I'm always the sentimental one.

14:38.317 --> 14:40.318
Oh, that's right, you are.

14:40.319 --> 14:41.486
Okay, come on.

14:41.487 --> 14:43.321
Champagne on the roof deck.

14:43.322 --> 14:44.322
- All right.
- Sound good?

14:44.323 --> 14:45.323
Perfect.

14:45.324 --> 14:46.357
Let's go.

14:46.358 --> 14:47.425
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

14:47.426 --> 14:48.526
Come on, come on, come on.

14:48.527 --> 14:50.767
Okay, I'm coming up.

15:10.049 --> 15:12.015
Aquí! Aquí!

15:26.571 --> 15:27.840
How does he not know that?

15:27.841 --> 15:30.685
Is a bird crapping on your head good luck?

15:30.686 --> 15:32.953
- I never heard of that.
- Everybody knows that that is good luck.

15:32.954 --> 15:34.655
- Bird crap?
- It's like rain on your wedding day.

15:34.656 --> 15:36.423
Oh, come on, we got to go.

15:36.424 --> 15:37.792
- Our curtain's in half an hour.
- Wait, wait.

15:37.793 --> 15:39.059
- No, don't do it.
- Let me just check...

15:39.060 --> 15:39.994
Don't. Come on.

15:39.995 --> 15:41.061
- Ugh.
- Hold on.

15:41.062 --> 15:42.229
It's-it's Blake.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.465
Okay.

15:44.466 --> 15:46.133
Hello?

15:46.134 --> 15:48.802
Hi. Uh, so sorry for calling.

15:48.803 --> 15:50.204
Everything's fine.

15:50.205 --> 15:52.473
Uh, Jason just had a little accident.

15:52.474 --> 15:54.074
Wait-wait, how little?

15:54.075 --> 15:56.176
He hurt his ankle. We're icing it,

15:56.177 --> 15:58.012
but it just keeps swelling,
uh, so I-I just think

15:58.013 --> 15:59.279
we should go to the emergency room.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.682
Wait... you think maybe it's broken?

16:01.683 --> 16:03.150
Uh, I don't know.

16:03.151 --> 16:05.152
Let me talk to him.

16:05.153 --> 16:06.386
Jason hurt his ankle.

16:06.387 --> 16:07.554
- I...
- How bad?

16:07.555 --> 16:08.722
I... we don't know yet.

16:08.723 --> 16:09.723
We don't know yet.

16:09.724 --> 16:10.757
- It's your mom.
- Hey, Mom.

16:10.758 --> 16:12.292
Hi, honey. Are you okay?

16:12.293 --> 16:13.994
Uh, yeah. Don't come home.

16:13.995 --> 16:15.963
You kind of forgot to
tell her it was your fault.

16:15.964 --> 16:18.232
- No, I don't... I don't think it's broken.
- It wasn't my fault.

16:18.233 --> 16:20.367
- I mean, I can move it and stuff.
- Okay.

16:20.368 --> 16:21.401
Okay, Blake's the only one

16:21.402 --> 16:22.803
who wants to go to the emergency room.

16:22.804 --> 16:24.638
Well, I think it's a good idea.

16:24.639 --> 16:25.605
Fine.

16:25.606 --> 16:27.007
I'll go if it makes you happy,

16:27.008 --> 16:28.308
but I don't need my mommy.

16:28.309 --> 16:29.409
Thank you for clarifying that.

16:29.410 --> 16:31.530
Can I talk to Blake again, please?

16:32.546 --> 16:33.880
Yeah.

16:33.881 --> 16:35.816
Listen, I think that you should take him,

16:35.817 --> 16:37.651
and just call us if it's anything more

16:37.652 --> 16:39.085
than a little sprain, okay?

16:39.086 --> 16:40.053
Will do.

16:40.054 --> 16:41.920
All right, thanks.

16:43.557 --> 16:45.659
So, Jason swears it's not broken,

16:45.660 --> 16:47.794
and he really doesn't want us to come home.

16:47.795 --> 16:49.296
Then he's fine.

16:49.297 --> 16:51.531
You know what, maybe we
should just call Stevie

16:51.532 --> 16:53.266
and have her go and check on him.

16:53.267 --> 16:55.635
I don't think we should ruin her weekend.

16:55.636 --> 16:56.770
We talked about this.

16:56.771 --> 16:58.204
Her spending time with her college friends

16:58.205 --> 17:00.273
- might encourage her to go back to school.
- Yeah.

17:00.274 --> 17:01.508
I don't want to jeopardize that.

17:01.509 --> 17:04.810
You think maybe we
could revisit that logic?

17:04.811 --> 17:06.079
What logic?

17:06.079 --> 17:09.883
That she deserves a fun
weekend with her college friends

17:09.884 --> 17:12.185
so that she might be reminded

17:12.185 --> 17:15.221
that it's a good idea to go
back and finish her education.

17:15.222 --> 17:16.723
We both agreed that might help.

17:16.723 --> 17:18.790
But why are we tip-toeing around it?

17:18.791 --> 17:22.729
Why don't we just demand
that she take responsibility

17:22.730 --> 17:24.196
and finish what she started?

17:24.198 --> 17:26.866
Because that will send her
in the opposite direction.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.635
We... Do you really
want to re-litigate this?

17:28.636 --> 17:29.902
I'm just saying...

17:29.903 --> 17:33.406
we're giving her an awfully wide berth

17:33.407 --> 17:36.142
to work out her issues.

17:36.143 --> 17:37.810
Don't you think maybe it's time

17:37.811 --> 17:39.545
that you worked out this thing with Stevie?

17:39.546 --> 17:41.748
I'm not the one with the thing.

17:41.749 --> 17:43.383
I have no thing.

17:43.384 --> 17:44.383
I don't feel...

17:44.384 --> 17:45.685
She finds it really difficult

17:45.686 --> 17:46.986
to approach you.

17:46.987 --> 17:48.387
Especially after what you told her.

17:48.388 --> 17:51.357
- Right, that I'm a torturer.
- Not my words.

17:51.358 --> 17:53.726
I explained that it was
a complicated situation,

17:53.727 --> 17:55.161
and I owned my part in it.

17:55.162 --> 17:56.662
Maybe you can help her process it.

17:56.663 --> 17:58.264
Oh, so now you're on her side?

17:58.265 --> 17:59.465
Uh...

17:59.466 --> 18:00.466
There's no s...

18:00.467 --> 18:01.534
It's not a competition.

18:01.535 --> 18:03.869
Well, then, why do I feel like it is?

18:03.870 --> 18:05.137
I don't know.

18:05.138 --> 18:07.573
Maybe this is just not
the time to talk about it.

18:07.574 --> 18:09.575
Okay.

18:09.576 --> 18:11.077
You're right.

18:11.078 --> 18:12.578
We'll pencil in a better time.

18:12.579 --> 18:13.946
- 'Cause that happens.
- Oh, come...

18:13.947 --> 18:15.047
Okay... baby...

18:15.048 --> 18:16.782
Look, look, look, look, look.

18:16.783 --> 18:17.950
You're upset about Jason.

18:17.951 --> 18:19.318
- Yes.
- Yes.

18:19.319 --> 18:21.086
And-and you're worried
about being away from home.

18:21.087 --> 18:22.555
And maybe you feel a little guilty.

18:22.556 --> 18:23.622
- I...
- I-I get it.

18:23.623 --> 18:26.592
I just don't want to fight.

18:26.593 --> 18:28.427
I want this weekend to be great.

18:28.428 --> 18:31.063
I know, it's-it's not
the right time to fight.

18:31.064 --> 18:32.531
- Okay. Come on.
- Not the time.

18:32.532 --> 18:34.166
Let's go see a raucous masterpiece.

18:34.167 --> 18:36.602
- We can fight later. Okay.
- Yeah.

18:36.603 --> 18:40.606
Ambassador Lopez claims
Ochoa is now missing,

18:40.607 --> 18:43.642
that he's been broken out of jail.

18:43.643 --> 18:44.843
- The cartels?
- Ah...

18:44.844 --> 18:46.345
Or is that just political double-talk

18:46.346 --> 18:48.113
for the extradition is off?

18:48.114 --> 18:50.015
Wait.

18:50.016 --> 18:52.751
âBlake is at the emergency
room with Jason McCord

18:52.752 --> 18:54.386
who has injured his ankleâ...

18:54.387 --> 18:55.687
Wh-Which hospital?

18:55.688 --> 18:57.222
MedStar Georgetown University.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.458
My God, if the media gets a hold of this,

18:59.459 --> 19:00.525
they'll have a field day.

19:00.526 --> 19:01.793
âSecretary of State's kid injured

19:01.794 --> 19:03.195
while she parties in New York.â

19:03.196 --> 19:05.564
Yeah, you better get down there.

19:05.565 --> 19:06.965
I think Blake's a little rattled.

19:06.966 --> 19:08.367
His message has a typo.

19:08.368 --> 19:09.568
I liked it.

19:09.569 --> 19:11.636
I mean, I have no idea what it means,

19:11.637 --> 19:12.738
but I liked it.

19:12.739 --> 19:14.573
People living in trash cans.

19:14.574 --> 19:16.675
That is a metaphor for something.

19:16.676 --> 19:18.143
The banality of life.

19:18.144 --> 19:19.277
Right.

19:19.278 --> 19:21.580
Which wouldn't seem like it's funny,

19:21.581 --> 19:22.748
but it was.

19:22.749 --> 19:24.116
âNothing funnier than unhappiness.â

19:24.117 --> 19:25.317
Beckett believed that.

19:25.318 --> 19:27.686
Well, he must have been
a real kick to live with.

19:27.687 --> 19:29.421
This-this is not

19:29.422 --> 19:32.356
the quaint French bistro I remember.

19:33.658 --> 19:36.228
It's a little more extreme
than it seemed on the Web site.

19:36.229 --> 19:37.596
Yeah.

19:37.597 --> 19:39.197
Deputy Cushing agrees...

19:39.198 --> 19:42.167
we need more information before
we can make any decisions.

19:42.168 --> 19:44.569
Well, Ambassador Lopez
was telling the truth...

19:44.570 --> 19:46.805
Ochoa was busted out of jail.

19:46.806 --> 19:48.673
- But the cartel isn't responsible.
- Who is?

19:48.674 --> 19:50.108
Texas.

19:50.109 --> 19:51.743
Friend of mine sent this link

19:51.744 --> 19:54.612
posted by some Texas militia.

19:54.613 --> 19:57.649
We, the citizens of the Republic of Texas,

19:57.650 --> 20:01.019
have taken Carlos Ochoa into custody

20:01.020 --> 20:03.655
so that he can face justice in Texas

20:03.656 --> 20:07.292
for the murder of State Trooper Roger...

20:07.293 --> 20:09.560
Looks like the governor's
oratory got someone fired up.

20:09.561 --> 20:10.862
So much for extradition.

20:10.863 --> 20:13.663
The U.S. just violated
Mexico's sovereignty.

20:16.668 --> 20:18.736
Okay, look, I know that I should drop it,

20:18.737 --> 20:19.771
but I can't drop it.

20:19.772 --> 20:21.672
I just think that if we clear the air

20:21.673 --> 20:22.840
with the stuff about Stevie,

20:22.841 --> 20:24.242
then-then we can have a nice dinner...

20:24.243 --> 20:26.644
- I so don't think we should do that.
- But the thing is...

20:26.645 --> 20:28.579
you treat her like she has
these delicate sensibilities.

20:28.580 --> 20:29.714
- I-I treat her?
- Yes.

20:29.715 --> 20:31.382
- Is this about how I...?
- And meanwhile,

20:31.383 --> 20:33.851
she's justified in passing
full judgment on my life?

20:33.852 --> 20:36.187
What 20-year-old girl isn't
judgmental about their mother?

20:36.188 --> 20:36.937
Just tell me.

20:36.938 --> 20:39.090
Okay, fine, so I should just
follow around behind her,

20:39.091 --> 20:41.425
take her temperature,
make sure that she's okay

20:41.426 --> 20:43.561
with the complex adult
decisions that I had to make?

20:43.562 --> 20:44.762
No, no.

20:44.763 --> 20:45.830
Well, then what?

20:45.831 --> 20:47.898
Henry?

20:47.899 --> 20:49.100
Klaus.

20:49.101 --> 20:51.001
What are you doing here?

20:51.002 --> 20:54.071
I was speaking at a symposium
at NYU which went long,

20:54.072 --> 20:55.339
as they always do,

20:55.340 --> 20:57.007
and, uh, missed my flight.

20:57.008 --> 20:58.776
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

20:58.777 --> 21:01.445
This place was recommended
to me by a colleague.

21:01.446 --> 21:02.513
Do you know it?

21:02.514 --> 21:04.548
Well, we used to know it, um, oh, uh...

21:04.549 --> 21:05.783
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

21:05.784 --> 21:08.052
Klaus Von Muhlberg, this
is my wife, Elizabeth.

21:08.053 --> 21:09.386
- Hi. How do you do?
- Enchanté.

21:09.387 --> 21:11.722
Klaus manages, uh, an
historical conservancy.

21:11.723 --> 21:12.550
Oh.

21:12.551 --> 21:13.958
Please, that makes me sound too important.

21:13.959 --> 21:16.961
I'm only an overworked,
underpaid college professor

21:16.962 --> 21:18.462
like your brilliant husband.

21:18.463 --> 21:20.331
Klaus recently took a position at GW.

21:20.332 --> 21:21.298
Oh, well, that's great.

21:21.299 --> 21:22.633
Uh, your table's ready, ma'am.

21:22.634 --> 21:24.702
It was good to see you, Klaus.

21:24.703 --> 21:25.969
Are... are you alone?

21:25.970 --> 21:27.471
I am, and being Friday night

21:27.472 --> 21:29.173
with no reservation makes it very tough

21:29.174 --> 21:31.141
to get a table for one, I'm afraid.

21:31.142 --> 21:33.444
Well, you should join us.

21:33.445 --> 21:35.446
Oh, I cannot intrude.

21:35.447 --> 21:36.980
Really, it-it's no intrusion.

21:36.981 --> 21:38.015
It's fine.

21:38.016 --> 21:39.249
Then I-I accept.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.218
I'll just settle up at the bar.

21:41.219 --> 21:44.321
Uh, Fred, Mr. Von Muhlberg
will be joining us for dinner.

21:44.322 --> 21:45.589
Yes, ma'am.

21:45.590 --> 21:46.823
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:46.824 --> 21:48.792
Why did you do that?

21:48.793 --> 21:50.127
I was being nice.

21:50.128 --> 21:51.861
If you don't mind, sir.

21:53.196 --> 21:54.965
This was supposed to be a romantic dinner.

21:54.966 --> 21:56.633
Oh, Henry, it's not a romantic dinner.

21:56.634 --> 21:59.369
And we're fighting, and it's
not even the same restaurant...

21:59.370 --> 22:00.771
I don't believe this.

22:00.772 --> 22:04.207
Honestly, I was doing it for you.

22:04.208 --> 22:07.878
You are acting so weird.

22:14.384 --> 22:16.752
Thank you.

22:23.419 --> 22:25.021
So, this charity event

22:25.022 --> 22:26.823
was a great success.

22:26.824 --> 22:28.624
Muslims, Sikhs, Jews and Christians

22:28.625 --> 22:30.626
coming together for a common cause.

22:30.627 --> 22:33.428
I felt like the great peacemaker.

22:34.964 --> 22:37.567
A passionate debate

22:37.568 --> 22:39.535
did eventually erupt.

22:39.536 --> 22:42.338
But not over religious beliefs, no, no.

22:42.339 --> 22:44.240
But over soccer.

22:45.842 --> 22:48.510
Excuse me. I'll be back in one minute.

23:01.424 --> 23:03.158
Hello?

23:03.159 --> 23:04.527
I'm with Klaus.

23:04.528 --> 23:05.561
Henry?

23:05.562 --> 23:06.996
What is he doing in New York?

23:06.997 --> 23:08.130
What happened to Tel Aviv?

23:08.131 --> 23:09.798
Where exactly are you?

23:09.799 --> 23:12.468
I'm celebrating my anniversary
with my wife in New York.

23:12.469 --> 23:14.436
We ran into him at a French restaurant.

23:14.437 --> 23:17.773
There's no way in hell I believe
he just randomly wandered in.

23:17.774 --> 23:20.142
He claims he was at a symposium at NYU.

23:20.143 --> 23:21.477
What is he really doing here?

23:21.478 --> 23:22.911
I have no idea.

23:22.912 --> 23:24.847
Is it possible that Klaus is playing us?

23:24.848 --> 23:27.449
That this is somehow about
getting close to my wife?

23:27.450 --> 23:28.750
He's got a briefcase.

23:28.751 --> 23:30.215
Elizabeth's security team checked it,

23:30.216 --> 23:31.653
but it was the family and friends search.

23:31.654 --> 23:32.888
They could've missed something.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.623
Klaus is a money launderer and a smuggler.

23:34.624 --> 23:35.724
He's not an assassin.

23:35.725 --> 23:36.725
He could have a weapon.

23:36.726 --> 23:37.859
Maybe a vial of sarin.

23:37.860 --> 23:39.094
He would've known he'd be searched.

23:39.095 --> 23:40.662
He would find some way to conceal it.

23:40.663 --> 23:42.097
Try not to blow your cover, Henry.

23:42.098 --> 23:43.565
Let me make some phone calls.

23:43.566 --> 23:45.033
Check his travel record.

23:45.034 --> 23:46.368
And this symposium.

23:46.369 --> 23:48.070
Make sure it was real and that he attended.

23:48.071 --> 23:49.638
- See if he missed a flight.
- All right.

23:49.639 --> 23:51.206
I've got to get back to the table.

23:51.207 --> 23:52.441
Text me.

23:52.442 --> 23:53.809
The vigilantes

23:53.810 --> 23:55.310
delivered Ochoa to Lockwood.

23:55.311 --> 23:57.345
He refuses to give him back to Mexico.

23:57.346 --> 24:01.049
Now, I'm satisfied he wasn't in
on the kidnapping, but he sure

24:01.050 --> 24:03.785
as hell is milking this
thing for all it's worth.

24:03.786 --> 24:06.922
And meanwhile, Russell
Jackson called from China.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.657
The president is in the middle

24:08.658 --> 24:10.392
of negotiations over North Korea.

24:10.393 --> 24:11.726
But regardless,

24:11.727 --> 24:14.829
Jackson wants the State
Department to handle this.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.831
He doesn't want the president
lowering himself to deal

24:16.832 --> 24:18.733
with a self-serving hustler like Lockwood.

24:18.734 --> 24:22.570
Um, perhaps we might call the secretary?

24:22.571 --> 24:24.272
Hold on, hold on.

24:24.273 --> 24:27.041
I'm on my way to a meeting
with the attorney general

24:27.042 --> 24:28.376
and DOJ.

24:28.377 --> 24:31.346
I'm sure that we can work all
this out in a timely manner.

24:31.347 --> 24:34.514
No reason to call the secretary.

24:41.089 --> 24:43.858
What we need here are some
back-channel negotiations.

24:43.859 --> 24:45.660
I think we need
front-channel negotiations.

24:45.661 --> 24:47.562
You should go to Texas and meet

24:47.563 --> 24:49.362
with your former boss.

24:51.165 --> 24:52.300
Should we order some dessert?

24:52.301 --> 24:55.036
I hope they still have
that strawberry savarin.

24:55.037 --> 24:56.804
And they do!

24:56.805 --> 24:59.340
I'm sorry. I've been texting with Alison

24:59.341 --> 25:00.641
to see how Jason is doing.

25:00.642 --> 25:01.876
Everything okay?

25:01.877 --> 25:03.643
Fine.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.017
Do you know how Henry and I first met?

25:10.018 --> 25:12.053
No. I don't.

25:12.054 --> 25:13.387
It was, um,

25:13.388 --> 25:15.756
a couple of years ago at
a conference in, uh...?

25:15.757 --> 25:16.791
- Cairo.
- Yeah.

25:16.792 --> 25:19.560
I told him about a religious

25:19.561 --> 25:22.330
pilgrimage I took to
Mount Kailash in Tibet,

25:22.331 --> 25:23.631
where I trekked up

25:23.632 --> 25:26.167
a 32-mile path

25:26.168 --> 25:27.601
that's supposed to erase

25:27.602 --> 25:29.570
the sins of a lifetime.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.639
Yes, Henry did that same pilgrimage.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.541
Didn't you? Right after the Marine Corps?

25:33.542 --> 25:35.443
And I knew then that we were kindred souls,

25:35.444 --> 25:38.145
meant to run into each other.

25:38.146 --> 25:40.014
I would love to take

25:40.015 --> 25:41.682
my son Adrien there one day.

25:41.683 --> 25:43.250
Oh, how old is he?

25:43.251 --> 25:44.351
14.

25:44.352 --> 25:46.320
He is the light of my life.

25:46.321 --> 25:48.521
He's the future.

25:49.823 --> 25:52.626
I know that he will leave a greater mark

25:52.627 --> 25:54.827
than I have.

25:56.330 --> 25:57.798
So, for our children?

25:57.799 --> 26:00.267
We make the necessary sacrifices, huh?

26:00.268 --> 26:02.436
Without fear or regret,

26:02.437 --> 26:05.272
we do what must be done.

26:05.273 --> 26:06.473
Henry?

26:06.474 --> 26:07.941
- Is there a problem, Dr. McCord?
- Yes.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.809
Move!

26:11.245 --> 26:13.279
Coming out!

26:30.867 --> 26:32.935
Are you okay?

26:33.803 --> 26:34.859
Is he the religious scholar

26:34.860 --> 26:36.594
that you were spying on for the NSA?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.399
Yes. Yes.

26:39.665 --> 26:40.952
You told me it was done.

26:40.953 --> 26:42.754
It went on a little longer than I admitted.

26:42.755 --> 26:44.221
- But it's over now.
- Hmm.

26:44.222 --> 26:46.223
Why should I believe you?

26:46.224 --> 26:47.725
After what happened in there,

26:47.726 --> 26:49.693
I think it's pretty safe to
say that my cover's blown.

26:49.694 --> 26:51.061
But you lied to me.

26:51.062 --> 26:52.496
Under penalty of law.

26:52.497 --> 26:54.498
And for your own safety. You know that.

26:54.499 --> 26:56.633
I have to be able to trust you, Henry.

26:56.634 --> 26:58.769
It wasn't a boys' night
out in there, Elizabeth.

26:58.770 --> 27:00.237
- I was nose to nose with terrorists.
- Yes, I get that.

27:00.238 --> 27:01.371
All right, then what
the hell is your point?

27:01.372 --> 27:03.973
Stop... yelling at me.

27:07.878 --> 27:09.446
The NSA canceled my op

27:09.447 --> 27:11.448
right before we came to New York.

27:11.449 --> 27:15.218
But then when Klaus
just showed up like that,

27:15.219 --> 27:17.888
it... I just... it didn't feel right,

27:17.889 --> 27:20.590
and I wasn't willing to take any risks.

27:20.591 --> 27:22.591
You did the right thing.

27:23.226 --> 27:24.828
Mr. Von Muhlberg's been searched.

27:24.829 --> 27:26.096
He's clean.

27:26.097 --> 27:27.397
We had to let him go.

27:27.398 --> 27:28.999
He says he was reaching for his briefcase

27:29.000 --> 27:31.701
to show you a picture of his son.

27:31.702 --> 27:33.103
I'm sorry, Fred.

27:33.104 --> 27:35.003
It's a long story.

27:38.842 --> 27:41.578
This is why the intelligence community

27:41.579 --> 27:43.446
shouldn't keep secrets from me.

27:43.447 --> 27:45.215
I agree.

27:45.216 --> 27:48.450
Not that we're doing a very good job of it.

27:54.457 --> 27:56.326
All right.

27:56.327 --> 27:58.128
Told you it was only a sprain.

27:58.129 --> 28:00.363
Well, better safe than sorry. Come here.

28:00.364 --> 28:02.232
- Smile, klutz.
- Know what? No pictures.

28:02.233 --> 28:04.200
- Okay, calm down.
- No, I won't.

28:04.201 --> 28:06.469
It's a miracle you got
in and out of the hospital

28:06.470 --> 28:07.737
without the paparazzi swarming you.

28:07.738 --> 28:09.405
They stake out the emergency rooms

28:09.406 --> 28:10.607
sniffing for a story.

28:10.608 --> 28:12.542
It wasn't a story. It was an accident.

28:12.543 --> 28:14.143
Um, you broke the Secretary of State's kid

28:14.144 --> 28:15.245
while she was out of town.

28:15.246 --> 28:16.972
- That's a story.
- Okay.

28:16.973 --> 28:18.948
- This was not my fault.
- It was totally your fault.

28:18.949 --> 28:19.949
You're so in denial.

28:19.950 --> 28:21.651
Look, you're the adult.

28:21.652 --> 28:22.986
You're in charge.

28:22.987 --> 28:25.321
Even if it's not your
fault, it's your fault.

28:25.322 --> 28:26.990
Okay, you must be joking.

28:26.991 --> 28:29.891
This was not my fault, okay?

28:30.860 --> 28:32.295
Oh, my God. This was my fault.

28:32.296 --> 28:33.796
I broke the Secretary of State's child.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.031
Don't spin out.

28:35.032 --> 28:36.199
It's over. I mean, I think

28:36.200 --> 28:37.300
we got away with it PR-wise.

28:37.301 --> 28:38.434
Still, I broke the child.

28:38.435 --> 28:39.836
And I'm gonna have to
account to her for that.

28:39.837 --> 28:41.070
Keep it together.

28:41.071 --> 28:43.806
The weekend is young.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.808
Yeah. No, yes, yes. Keep moving forward.

28:45.809 --> 28:46.976
Hey, you!

28:46.977 --> 28:49.478
Perfect time for you
to do your Italy report.

28:49.479 --> 28:50.813
Whoa, whoa! Are you kidding?

28:50.814 --> 28:53.574
I have the best excuse
ever for not doing it.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.153
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

28:57.154 --> 28:59.422
Governor Lockwood is bravely holding court

28:59.423 --> 29:01.524
outside Carrington J. McVesper Unit Prison,

29:01.525 --> 29:03.559
where that cop killer Ochoa

29:03.560 --> 29:05.961
is finally facing justice.

29:05.962 --> 29:07.596
Texas style.

29:07.597 --> 29:09.298
Support the governor by getting in your car

29:09.299 --> 29:10.299
and driving over there

29:10.300 --> 29:11.767
right now.

29:11.768 --> 29:13.903
And if those Fed bastards don't like it,

29:13.904 --> 29:15.838
well, I got a message for them.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.906
In the immortal words of
another great Texas governor,

29:17.907 --> 29:19.740
âBring...â

29:21.477 --> 29:25.280
- Governor.
- Ah!

29:25.281 --> 29:27.583
I thought DC would send
someone down eventually.

29:27.584 --> 29:29.551
Hoping it would be you.

29:29.552 --> 29:31.820
Don't you think it's time to put an end

29:31.821 --> 29:33.856
to this, return Ochoa to Mexico?

29:33.857 --> 29:36.058
Return him?

29:36.059 --> 29:38.160
Ochoa is gonna stand trial.

29:38.161 --> 29:39.394
Yes, he will.

29:39.395 --> 29:40.963
When he's extradited
through proper channels.

29:40.964 --> 29:42.431
Not by kidnapping.

29:42.432 --> 29:45.234
Oh, it's just like the old saying goes.

29:45.235 --> 29:47.636
Uh, âThe means...

29:47.637 --> 29:50.505
the means justify the ends.â

29:50.506 --> 29:53.241
I know your approval
ratings are through the roof,

29:53.242 --> 29:54.810
people saying you're doing the right thing,

29:54.811 --> 29:56.612
but do you really believe that?

29:56.613 --> 29:58.280
Honestly, it looks as
if you had foreknowledge

29:58.281 --> 29:59.748
of what this militia was planning,

29:59.749 --> 30:01.583
which makes you the opposite of a hero.

30:01.584 --> 30:02.751
It makes you culpable.

30:02.752 --> 30:04.886
Who are you to talk to me like that?

30:04.887 --> 30:07.522
I gave you your first job in politics.

30:07.523 --> 30:10.892
If it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't be where you are today.

30:10.893 --> 30:13.528
You know, you had best watch yourself.

30:13.529 --> 30:15.964
You may just have to answer to me one day.

30:26.474 --> 30:29.576
They're here for Ochoa.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.185
Governor Lockwood, a
warrant for the release

30:37.186 --> 30:39.553
of Carlos Ochoa.

30:44.414 --> 30:47.377
You can take your warrant and go home.

30:49.330 --> 30:51.432
Wow. A real live

30:51.433 --> 30:52.834
Mexican standoff.

30:52.835 --> 30:54.102
The FBI are at a loss.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.770
If the governor won't honor their warrant,

30:55.771 --> 30:56.938
what recourse do they have?

30:56.939 --> 30:59.007
Beyond a Supreme Court case that'll go on

30:59.008 --> 31:01.075
for years or a gun fight.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.177
This is exactly what Lockwood wanted.

31:03.178 --> 31:05.613
The FBI and the federal government

31:05.614 --> 31:09.283
bullying local law enforcement on the news.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.519
I guess it can't get much worse than this.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.621
Oh, well, I spoke

31:13.622 --> 31:16.023
with Ambassador Lopez this morning.

31:16.024 --> 31:18.593
Mexico is threatening to
stop policing its borders.

31:18.594 --> 31:19.994
And not just at Texas.

31:19.995 --> 31:21.896
The entire border.

31:21.897 --> 31:23.197
You can't be serious.

31:23.198 --> 31:24.966
His exact words were:

31:24.967 --> 31:27.435
âYou think it's hard to
handle a flood of immigrants,

31:27.436 --> 31:29.804
let's see how you handle a tidal wave.â

31:29.805 --> 31:31.405
And where's Deputy Cushing?

31:31.406 --> 31:32.807
He's trying to talk to the DOJ

31:32.808 --> 31:35.343
and attorney general to try
to figure out the next move.

31:35.344 --> 31:36.944
Nadine, Cushing had his shot.

31:36.945 --> 31:38.279
The White House is refusing to deal

31:38.280 --> 31:40.581
with a rogue governor,
no one's backing down.

31:40.582 --> 31:43.316
It's... it's time to call the secretary.

31:46.420 --> 31:49.457
I haven't been gone 24 hours.

31:49.458 --> 31:52.359
Civil war with Texas?

31:52.360 --> 31:53.827
Really?

32:05.752 --> 32:07.287
I could go to Texas with you.

32:07.288 --> 32:10.323
I don't know how long it's gonna take

32:10.324 --> 32:12.158
or what's gonna happen.

32:12.159 --> 32:14.494
But I know it's not gonna be

32:14.495 --> 32:17.297
relaxing or romantic.

32:17.298 --> 32:20.100
I think maybe it's just
best to put this occasion

32:20.101 --> 32:21.101
out of its misery.

32:21.102 --> 32:22.702
I'm sorry about this weekend.

32:22.703 --> 32:24.738
I-I'll make it up to you.

32:24.739 --> 32:26.506
We'll make it up to each other.

32:26.507 --> 32:28.675
I don't know when, I don't know how,

32:28.676 --> 32:30.710
but we will.

32:30.711 --> 32:33.112
I'll see you back at home, okay?

32:33.113 --> 32:35.514
Okay. Bye.

32:57.937 --> 33:01.906
This is the oldest police
precinct in the city.

33:02.608 --> 33:05.812
I thought it would be a good place to meet

33:05.813 --> 33:07.813
to assuage any fears

33:07.814 --> 33:10.116
you might have.

33:10.117 --> 33:12.617
What did you want to talk about?

33:13.252 --> 33:15.353
I know you planted the bug.

33:16.422 --> 33:17.790
Which means that you're working

33:17.791 --> 33:19.759
for one of the intelligence agencies.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.861
Which one is not important.

33:21.862 --> 33:24.530
Of course...

33:24.531 --> 33:27.700
running into you last
night was not a coincidence.

33:27.701 --> 33:32.637
But I had no intention of
hurting you, or your wife.

33:35.975 --> 33:37.708
I want protection.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.248
I'm in too deep

33:43.249 --> 33:45.117
with certain people whose views

33:45.118 --> 33:47.086
have become much too radical

33:47.087 --> 33:49.020
for my peace of mind.

33:50.389 --> 33:52.057
And the truth is I've been trying

33:52.058 --> 33:54.818
to distance myself from them of late.

33:55.527 --> 33:58.364
But if these people find out
that an intelligence agency

33:58.365 --> 34:00.999
caught on to me...

34:01.000 --> 34:04.303
they might be inclined to seek out leverage

34:04.304 --> 34:06.771
to keep me in check.

34:08.407 --> 34:09.840
Your son.

34:11.143 --> 34:14.012
All I want is, uh, protection...

34:14.013 --> 34:16.782
for Adrien.

34:16.783 --> 34:18.784
I was hoping you could help me,

34:18.784 --> 34:21.585
you and your wife.

34:22.521 --> 34:24.222
I don't want to go to the CIA

34:24.223 --> 34:27.159
and end up in a pit...

34:27.159 --> 34:29.920
at some black site in Poland.

34:30.128 --> 34:32.263
Can you help me, Henry?

34:39.938 --> 34:41.940
Did I miss anything on the way here,

34:41.940 --> 34:44.242
like Texas seceding?

34:44.243 --> 34:45.476
No, ma'am.

34:45.478 --> 34:47.045
Well, that's good news.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.880
I heard you spoke to Ambassador Lopez.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.382
I did.

34:50.382 --> 34:53.652
I spent the entire first
half of my flight apologizing

34:53.652 --> 34:55.020
on behalf of the United States

34:55.021 --> 34:56.788
for violating Mexican sovereignty.

34:56.789 --> 35:01.092
I had to agree to bilateral
talks on proposed subsidies

35:01.093 --> 35:02.527
to improve border infrastructure

35:02.528 --> 35:03.895
to process commercial traffic.

35:03.896 --> 35:07.931
So what's the lowdown on Governor Lockwood?

35:09.300 --> 35:11.169
Politics for most people is about finesse,

35:11.170 --> 35:13.037
but for Lockwood, it's about shock and awe.

35:13.038 --> 35:15.907
Pick a fight, see who's left standing.

35:15.908 --> 35:17.242
And after talking to him,

35:17.243 --> 35:19.777
I'm positive this whole
thing is just one big show.

35:19.778 --> 35:20.979
What does that mean?

35:20.980 --> 35:22.780
Lockwood is grandstanding

35:22.781 --> 35:24.782
for a presidential run in the future.

35:24.783 --> 35:28.353
Well, that is certainly an
ace to have up my sleeve.

35:28.354 --> 35:30.488
Huh.

35:30.489 --> 35:32.924
Do you have a game plan, Madam Secretary?

35:32.925 --> 35:35.493
Eh... not entirely.

35:35.494 --> 35:36.761
How long is the drive?

35:36.762 --> 35:39.296
It's 20 minutes with traffic.

35:40.331 --> 35:42.999
That ought to be enough.

36:08.527 --> 36:09.760
Madam Secretary...

36:09.761 --> 36:11.929
I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure.

36:11.930 --> 36:13.130
Well, I'm sorry we're not meeting

36:13.131 --> 36:15.499
under more favorable circumstances.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.002
Well, favorable circumstances

36:18.003 --> 36:20.337
really depend on one's perspective.

36:22.207 --> 36:24.508
Can we, uh, find someplace...

36:24.509 --> 36:26.843
a little bit more private, to talk?

36:28.112 --> 36:29.780
I'm comfortable right here.

36:29.781 --> 36:31.248
Okay.

36:31.249 --> 36:33.884
My office received a warrant
for your arrest this morning,

36:33.885 --> 36:35.419
from the Mexican government,

36:35.420 --> 36:37.721
for the illegal confinement
of a Mexican citizen,

36:37.722 --> 36:40.222
and they want to start
the extradition process.

36:41.592 --> 36:43.060
Well, well, well.

36:43.061 --> 36:44.728
I didn't think they had it in 'em.

36:44.729 --> 36:46.730
Oh, well, they didn't.

36:46.731 --> 36:48.165
It was my suggestion.

36:48.166 --> 36:51.168
Be a hell of a run for the presidency

36:51.169 --> 36:54.438
with an arrest warrant
hanging over your head.

36:54.439 --> 36:55.606
Jay's a good soldier.

36:55.607 --> 36:57.941
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:57.942 --> 36:59.476
Looks like I'm just gonna have to

36:59.477 --> 37:02.679
wipe Cancun off my vacation list.

37:02.680 --> 37:05.749
Well, if you're convicted in absentia,

37:05.750 --> 37:08.251
that would mean that any
country that you visited

37:08.252 --> 37:10.020
that had an extradition treaty with Mexico

37:10.021 --> 37:12.489
could arrest you and ship you off.

37:12.490 --> 37:15.859
If you actually became president,

37:15.860 --> 37:17.627
that would create...

37:17.628 --> 37:19.995
quite a problem.

37:21.898 --> 37:23.732
I'm listening.

37:24.701 --> 37:28.672
I've finalized the extradition
of Carlos Ochoa with Mexico.

37:28.673 --> 37:30.874
Now you're gonna hand him over to the FBI

37:30.875 --> 37:32.742
without any further delay.

37:32.743 --> 37:33.877
And you're also gonna recall

37:33.878 --> 37:37.781
the National Guard from the border.

37:37.782 --> 37:39.282
If you don't comply,

37:39.283 --> 37:41.685
I'll recommend to the attorney general

37:41.686 --> 37:45.522
to prepare formal charges as to
the federal laws you've broken:

37:45.523 --> 37:48.858
abuse of official capacity,

37:48.859 --> 37:50.760
unlawful restraint,

37:50.761 --> 37:53.396
interference with public duty,

37:53.397 --> 37:55.297
conspiracy...

37:59.269 --> 38:00.637
Tell the state troopers

38:00.638 --> 38:03.104
to release Mr. Ochoa to the FBI.

38:03.740 --> 38:06.409
Great.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.111
Have a nice day.

38:22.558 --> 38:24.760
He claims to know the location

38:24.761 --> 38:26.629
of the cache of missing sarin gas,

38:26.630 --> 38:27.964
but he'll only talk to you.

38:27.965 --> 38:30.633
So Klaus is, in fact,
not clean, as you claimed.

38:30.634 --> 38:32.435
Like I told you before,

38:32.436 --> 38:34.303
we were looking for any recent activity,

38:34.304 --> 38:35.571
but there was none.

38:35.572 --> 38:37.607
Anyway, after Klaus found the bug,

38:37.608 --> 38:38.641
he made sure to scrub anything

38:38.642 --> 38:39.809
that could've been incriminating.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.477
And his son Adrien is safe?

38:41.478 --> 38:43.678
We can't touch him.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.483
If we snap him up, the
people Klaus is working for

38:47.484 --> 38:49.518
will know it's us, and he's burned.

38:49.519 --> 38:50.953
And...?

38:50.954 --> 38:53.355
Now that we've flipped him,
we're sending him back out.

38:53.356 --> 38:54.557
When he brings us

38:54.558 --> 38:56.859
enough information, his
reward will be protection

38:56.860 --> 38:57.960
for his son.

38:57.961 --> 39:00.062
So you're using Adrien as leverage.

39:00.063 --> 39:02.364
That's exactly why he came
to us in the first place,

39:02.365 --> 39:03.999
- so that wouldn't happen.
- Be careful how much sympathy

39:04.000 --> 39:05.734
you give the man; he
does work for terrorists.

39:05.735 --> 39:06.902
Klaus deserves whatever he gets,

39:06.903 --> 39:09.238
but his son should not
be a pawn in all this.

39:09.239 --> 39:11.206
If Klaus cared about his son at all,

39:11.207 --> 39:13.774
he never would've gotten
involved with Abu Khinjar.

39:15.077 --> 39:17.378
Well?

39:19.314 --> 39:20.582
You have some work to do...

39:20.583 --> 39:22.583
before they'll protect Adrien.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.654
I must do penance;

39:25.655 --> 39:28.824
trek across Mount Kailash once again,

39:28.825 --> 39:33.194
to erase the sins of a lifetime.

39:34.897 --> 39:36.064
When you've delivered,

39:36.065 --> 39:38.100
I will make sure that your son is safe.

39:38.101 --> 39:40.102
Trust me.

39:40.103 --> 39:43.772
I know people in very high places.

39:51.379 --> 39:54.416
My life's over...

39:54.417 --> 39:56.785
but it would be very comforting to know

39:56.786 --> 39:59.987
that Adrien's is not.

40:04.860 --> 40:08.029
The sarin gas is in a warehouse...

40:08.030 --> 40:11.431
in El Oued, Algeria.

40:22.911 --> 40:25.647
...Ochoa is finally in the United States

40:25.648 --> 40:29.384
and the federal government swoops in

40:29.385 --> 40:31.652
to reap the sweat of my labor.

40:32.921 --> 40:34.389
Death penalty's off the table,

40:34.390 --> 40:37.125
which I've been forced to accept,

40:37.126 --> 40:39.360
but that Ochoa's to be tried

40:39.361 --> 40:41.062
in a New York court

40:41.063 --> 40:42.764
- instead of a Texas one...
- Hi.

40:42.765 --> 40:44.299
Morning.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.067
...that's an outrage.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.169
It's an outrage.

40:49.938 --> 40:52.640
Madam Secretary...

40:52.641 --> 40:54.976
it's my fault that Jason hurt his ankle

40:54.977 --> 40:56.344
and didn't finish his paper.

40:56.345 --> 40:58.479
Hmm.

40:58.480 --> 41:01.916
Well, Jason was playing
football in the house,

41:01.917 --> 41:04.485
which he is strictly forbidden to do,

41:04.486 --> 41:06.587
so I'll give you a pass on that one.

41:06.588 --> 41:08.523
And he did finish his paper.

41:08.524 --> 41:10.124
He did?

41:10.125 --> 41:11.926
Yeah.

41:11.927 --> 41:14.194
Kids are unpredictable that way.

41:15.129 --> 41:18.032
Well... I appreciate your
generosity, Madam Secretary,

41:18.033 --> 41:20.368
but there is no other way
to look at this situation

41:20.369 --> 41:22.402
other than that I failed you.

41:23.003 --> 41:24.571
Fine.

41:25.673 --> 41:26.841
Fine?

41:26.842 --> 41:28.075
Yeah.

41:28.076 --> 41:30.845
I mean, if that's the
way you want to see it.

41:30.846 --> 41:32.512
Failure builds character.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.982
That's not how I want to see it.

41:36.585 --> 41:38.185
Look, if it's any consolation,

41:38.186 --> 41:40.955
my anniversary trip was
a crushing disappointment,

41:40.956 --> 41:44.658
even without family injuries and civil war.

41:45.927 --> 41:48.395
Tell you what... why don't we just...

41:48.396 --> 41:51.465
chalk up the entire weekend

41:51.466 --> 41:54.001
to a universal fiasco.

41:54.002 --> 41:55.901
That happens.

41:58.405 --> 42:00.074
I will shift my perspective accordingly.

42:00.075 --> 42:01.809
Thanks, Blake.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.576
Yeah.

42:06.013 --> 42:08.547
Hello?

42:09.149 --> 42:10.484
Hey.

42:10.485 --> 42:11.985
Is everybody already asleep?

42:11.986 --> 42:14.186
Well, not everybody.

42:15.489 --> 42:17.257
Sorry I missed dinner.

42:17.258 --> 42:19.192
I just had a bunch of loose ends

42:19.193 --> 42:20.761
I had to tie up at work.

42:20.762 --> 42:21.895
Look, I've been thinking about

42:21.896 --> 42:23.330
how everything went so wrong this weekend.

42:23.331 --> 42:25.232
Oh, God, me, too.

42:25.233 --> 42:26.400
And I am sorry,

42:26.401 --> 42:27.734
it's my fault.

42:27.735 --> 42:30.737
I was completely wracked
with guilt about leaving,

42:30.738 --> 42:31.905
we'd just been away,

42:31.906 --> 42:33.740
and then this whole
ongoing thing with Stevie...

42:33.741 --> 42:35.041
Okay, look, it's my fault, too.

42:35.042 --> 42:36.643
- The nostalgia... ugh!
- No...

42:36.644 --> 42:38.745
And the-the pressure to
make everything perfect...

42:38.746 --> 42:40.814
trying to get back to our old lives.

42:40.815 --> 42:44.184
It just forces us to confront
how different everything is.

42:44.185 --> 42:45.385
We gotta stop doing that.

42:45.386 --> 42:47.621
- Yeah.
- We just need to move into the unknown,

42:47.622 --> 42:49.389
and trust that whatever
happens, we'll handle it.

42:49.390 --> 42:50.323
Live in the moment.

42:50.324 --> 42:51.391
- Yes.
- Yeah.

42:51.392 --> 42:52.759
Not try and orchestrate them.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.394
Yeah, I think so. For a while.

42:54.395 --> 42:57.963
I'm sure that's not as
depressing as it sounds.

42:59.065 --> 43:00.300
I ordered Chinese.

43:00.301 --> 43:02.102
Oh, God, I'm starving.

43:02.103 --> 43:03.203
The good greasy kind?

43:03.204 --> 43:04.304
Oh, oh, yeah.

43:04.305 --> 43:07.065
Oh, and I got out the old Scrabble board.

43:07.774 --> 43:09.042
Well, now, see, now, this...

43:09.043 --> 43:12.312
Chinese food, greasy, Scrabble board...

43:12.313 --> 43:13.880
Nostalgic.

43:13.881 --> 43:14.848
No. Course not.

43:14.849 --> 43:17.935
- It's timeless.
- Thank God. Okay.

43:19.019 --> 43:20.186
Thank you.

43:20.187 --> 43:22.707
- See? Fork... okay...
- Stupid French restaurant.
