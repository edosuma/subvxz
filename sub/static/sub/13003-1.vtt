00:51.690 --> 00:53.660
<i>Let's welcome
our favorite alumnus,</i>

00:53.730 --> 00:56.760
<i>and the next senator
from the state of New York,</i>

00:56.830 --> 00:59.700
<i>David Norris!</i>

01:00.040 --> 01:03.130
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

01:03.210 --> 01:04.870
<i>Well, hi, there.</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:06.530
<i>My name is David Norris,</i>

01:06.610 --> 01:09.770
<i>and I'd like to be the next senator
from the great state of New York.</i>

01:11.710 --> 01:13.310
Look at you.
What's your name?

01:13.380 --> 01:14.820
I'm going to go through
Yonkers, door to door

01:14.880 --> 01:16.910
and take the city that way.
We love you.

01:17.050 --> 01:18.680
<i>The recent endorsement
by the fire fighter's union</i>

01:18.750 --> 01:20.150
<i>is another boost to Norris</i>

01:20.220 --> 01:21.920
<i>who already had
a six-point lead</i>

01:21.990 --> 01:23.480
<i>over his opponent,
Roger Linfield.</i>

01:23.560 --> 01:27.430
Whenever I see you on
C- Span, and you stand,

01:27.500 --> 01:29.900
I always think you're
about to go, "Chug!"

01:30.600 --> 01:32.460
Congressman, you certainly
started your career off,

01:32.530 --> 01:35.770
<i>eight years ago, with a bang
or should I say, a bust.</i>

01:54.390 --> 01:56.190
<i>For the last eight years,</i>

01:56.260 --> 02:00.820
<i>David Norris has represented
Brooklyn, New York City and America.</i>

02:00.900 --> 02:03.060
This is my campaign
chairman, Charlie Traynor.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.190
These are voters.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.030
Latest polls have
you up 10 points.

02:06.170 --> 02:07.970
<i>We're 10 points up?</i>

02:08.070 --> 02:09.900
<i>This is not going to be
easy getting there.</i>

02:09.970 --> 02:11.400
<i>I have some
real opposition,</i>

02:11.470 --> 02:12.740
<i>and what they're
saying about me</i>

02:12.810 --> 02:14.800
<i>is that I'm too young
to hold this office.</i>

02:14.910 --> 02:16.400
Win big, but run
like you're 20 down.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.600
Okay, you got it.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.700
Thank you, Gary.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.540
<i>But that's okay because
these are the same people</i>

02:20.620 --> 02:22.740
<i>who say that young
people don't vote,</i>

02:22.820 --> 02:25.120
<i>young people don't
care about politics,</i>

02:25.190 --> 02:26.680
<i>but I'm here to tell you,</i>

02:26.760 --> 02:29.720
<i>your future is about
your choices, not theirs.</i>

02:29.790 --> 02:32.060
<i>So, today I'd like
to put them on notice</i>

02:32.130 --> 02:34.930
<i>because come November,
I want them to know</i>

02:35.030 --> 02:36.960
<i>that it was young
people like you,</i>

02:37.030 --> 02:39.020
<i>who kicked their asses.</i>

02:42.940 --> 02:44.800
David! David!

02:50.650 --> 02:51.840
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:53.380 --> 02:54.370
Charlie.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.640
What's wrong?

03:15.840 --> 03:16.830
Yeah?

03:16.910 --> 03:18.300
<i>Any ideas?</i>

03:19.710 --> 03:21.140
I'm working on it.

03:21.210 --> 03:22.940
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

03:23.010 --> 03:24.210
Yeah.

03:51.070 --> 03:52.130
<i>David Norris,</i>

03:52.210 --> 03:54.730
<i>until recently, he was
way ahead in the polls.</i>

03:54.810 --> 03:57.330
<i>Mary Matalin and
James Carville are here.</i>

03:57.410 --> 03:59.880
<i>Mary, this is a surprise.</i>

03:59.950 --> 04:01.940
<i>It is a surprise.
Such political promise.</i>

04:02.020 --> 04:04.610
<i>This compelling story, he grew up
in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn.</i>

04:04.690 --> 04:06.680
<i>He overcame the loss
of his entire family,</i>

04:06.760 --> 04:08.550
<i>his mom and his brother
when he was 10,</i>

04:08.620 --> 04:11.110
<i>his father before he got to
high school, he got over that.</i>

04:11.190 --> 04:12.390
<i>He had such promise.</i>

04:12.460 --> 04:15.090
<i>And he was the
youngest person</i>

04:15.160 --> 04:17.100
<i>ever elected to the
House of Representatives.</i>

04:17.170 --> 04:19.899
<i>Yeah, he was elected
when he was actually 24,</i>

04:19.970 --> 04:23.030
<i>but he gets in a bar room fight
the night that he's elected.</i>

04:23.100 --> 04:24.500
<i>I like this, all right.</i>

04:24.570 --> 04:26.940
<i>Then you have this photo
coming out of the New York Post.</i>

04:27.010 --> 04:29.140
<i>I think the accretion
of this stuff</i>

04:29.210 --> 04:31.610
<i>was just too much
for the voters.</i>

04:31.710 --> 04:34.680
<i>It reeked of some
level of immaturity here,</i>

04:34.750 --> 04:35.940
<i>of impulsiveness.</i>

04:36.050 --> 04:39.210
<i>People want maturity,
they want adults in Congress.</i>

04:51.570 --> 04:53.500
Big night
for us, gentlemen.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.690
Everybody ready?

04:59.140 --> 05:00.840
You look exhausted.

05:00.910 --> 05:03.400
You should take a vacation
when all this is finished.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.640
You've earned it.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.310
I'm not sure the
kind of tired I am

05:06.380 --> 05:08.110
can be fixed by a vacation.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.810
Everybody needs
a vacation,

05:10.890 --> 05:12.480
even us.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.550
All right, let's get
him back on track.

05:15.620 --> 05:17.150
<i>Mary, over
the past couple of weeks</i>

05:17.230 --> 05:19.850
<i>since the photo came out,
they thought people...</i>

05:19.930 --> 05:21.660
Why are you still
watching CNN?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.960
<i>That it wasn't such a big
deal, but clearly it was.</i>

05:24.630 --> 05:26.660
They called this way
too early. Come on.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.770
Put on your pretty
little tie and let's go.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.410
Suffolk County numbers,

05:34.610 --> 05:38.070
Linfield, 415,120.
Norris...

05:39.610 --> 05:42.050
370,233.

05:43.450 --> 05:44.920
Wow.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.690
I really thought
we'd win Suffolk.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.060
Kings County
just came in, too.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.760
Well...

05:55.360 --> 05:57.350
I didn't win Brooklyn.

05:58.030 --> 05:59.690
It's going to
be a blow out.

05:59.770 --> 06:02.100
NBC has us up next.

06:05.810 --> 06:07.040
I'm going to go
work on my speech.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.230
David...

06:08.310 --> 06:10.370
David. Hey!

06:11.910 --> 06:14.910
I'm sorry I wasted
your time, Charlie.

06:18.350 --> 06:22.260
<i>NBC news is now calling the
election for Roger Linfield.</i>

06:22.320 --> 06:24.810
<i>After a shockingly poor
showing at both Suffolk County,</i>

06:24.890 --> 06:26.590
<i>and his home county, Kings,</i>

06:26.660 --> 06:30.930
<i>it now appears David Norris
will lose this election badly.</i>

06:39.310 --> 06:40.900
Hello?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.110
Hello?

06:43.380 --> 06:44.370
I grew
up in Red Hook,

06:44.450 --> 06:45.810
and I don't want
to surprise anybody,

06:45.880 --> 06:47.870
but I got into a few
fistfights along the way.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.180
It's not whether or not
you get knocked down,

06:49.250 --> 06:50.770
it's what you do
when you get back up.

06:50.850 --> 06:52.620
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
here tonight to tell you

06:52.690 --> 06:54.780
I will get back up.

06:56.730 --> 06:57.890
But tonight is
not about me.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.190
It is about
coming together

06:59.260 --> 07:01.560
and welcoming
the newest senator

07:01.630 --> 07:03.690
for the great
state of New York,

07:06.300 --> 07:08.100
Roger Linfield.

07:09.370 --> 07:11.170
Shit!

07:11.240 --> 07:13.230
Shit, shit, shit.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.070
Hello?

07:26.890 --> 07:28.860
It's the men's.
Yep.

07:32.130 --> 07:34.360
Sorry about that.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

07:34.430 --> 07:37.190
I just didn't know
what to do.

07:37.270 --> 07:38.630
I heard you come in
and say, "Hello,"

07:38.700 --> 07:40.360
and I probably should
have said, "Hi,"

07:40.440 --> 07:42.060
but then I thought
that would be weird

07:42.240 --> 07:44.070
because it's the men's.

07:44.140 --> 07:47.370
Then you started
talking to yourself

07:47.440 --> 07:48.970
and it was obviously
very personal.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.980
So I was stuck
in no man's land,

07:51.350 --> 07:53.940
and then it all got to be
too much, so I came out.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.280
What are you doing in here?

07:57.850 --> 07:59.680
Just...

07:59.750 --> 08:01.720
I'm hiding from security.

08:02.420 --> 08:03.450
Why?

08:03.830 --> 08:06.160
I crashed
a wedding upstairs.

08:06.330 --> 08:07.890
People still do that?

08:09.200 --> 08:11.100
It was a dare.

08:11.270 --> 08:13.960
Who dared you
to crash a wedding?

08:15.900 --> 08:17.100
Me.

08:17.170 --> 08:18.160
Oh.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.480
I crashed a wedding once.
Did you?

08:22.540 --> 08:23.940
Yeah, in high school.

08:24.010 --> 08:25.380
Oh.

08:25.810 --> 08:27.710
But I got caught.
I spent the night in jail.

08:28.780 --> 08:31.340
I think that happened more
than once from what I heard.

08:31.990 --> 08:34.390
You're that guy running
for Senate, aren't you?

08:34.460 --> 08:36.250
Yeah, I am that guy.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.720
And judging from your
speech, you're not winning?

08:38.789 --> 08:40.230
No.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.419
Oh. That's too bad,
the other guy is such a tool.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.890
He is a tool.

08:44.970 --> 08:47.800
I wish I could have made that
clearer in the campaign ads.

08:47.940 --> 08:49.730
Personally, I think
mooning your friends

08:49.800 --> 08:52.300
at a college reunion
is no big deal.

08:52.410 --> 08:54.430
<i>The Post did not have
to run the photo.</i>

08:54.510 --> 08:56.640
At least
not a full page.

08:56.710 --> 08:57.870
God, no.

09:00.350 --> 09:03.040
It was my favorite moment
of your whole campaign.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.020
Really? I could have
used you on my team

09:05.090 --> 09:06.450
a couple of months ago.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.610
I could help poll test

09:07.690 --> 09:10.420
every word that comes out of
your mouth before you say it.

09:10.490 --> 09:11.820
Oh, you like politicians?

09:11.890 --> 09:13.990
I like it when they do
stuff I can relate to.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.190
Like pull their
pants down?

09:15.260 --> 09:16.290
I love that.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.700
See, that kind of candidate wouldn't
even get elected to the student council.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.740
My guy would know
how to tie his own tie.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.860
It's a clip-on.

09:23.940 --> 09:25.630
Oh, I wish.

09:25.710 --> 09:28.140
That would have been my other
favorite moment of your campaign.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.370
Do you still
have a chance?

09:32.450 --> 09:34.240
Is it over?

09:34.320 --> 09:36.010
He crushed me.

09:37.020 --> 09:38.540
Sorry.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.650
Well, losing has
its advantages.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.250
Like what?

09:42.360 --> 09:45.380
For one thing, as a politician,
you're never really alone

09:45.460 --> 09:48.660
unless you're asleep,
or in the bathroom usually.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.390
That gets old.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.160
Really?

09:53.270 --> 09:55.760
Yeah, I guess I'm mostly
just looking forward

09:55.840 --> 09:58.270
to having some
time by myself.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.210
I don't buy it.
I think you love it.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.610
Do I know you?

10:16.620 --> 10:18.490
I guess I could have
been more convincing.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.620
Okay.

10:19.690 --> 10:23.130
You don't have to worry about being
convincing till the next election.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.190
Are you a registered
New York voter?

10:25.270 --> 10:27.890
Do I sound like I am?

10:43.650 --> 10:45.350
Holy shit.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.180
David.

10:50.060 --> 10:52.150
Oh. Wow, sorry, guys.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.260
Sorry.
I got to go.

10:57.030 --> 10:58.500
Sorry.

11:00.470 --> 11:01.530
Wow.
Hang on.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.690
You going to give your speech?
Hang on.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.630
Hey!

11:05.240 --> 11:06.300
Hey.

11:08.510 --> 11:09.570
Ma'am.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.240
I got to go.

11:11.910 --> 11:12.900
Ma'am?

11:12.980 --> 11:14.310
That is so much better.

11:14.420 --> 11:15.710
She's on the move.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.480
Southwest staircase.

11:18.550 --> 11:21.150
Excuse me? Ma'am.

11:21.220 --> 11:23.050
What was that?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.160
I don't know.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.020
Are you ready?

11:27.100 --> 11:28.620
Yeah, yeah.

11:29.030 --> 11:31.460
All right, go do
the speech. Come on.

11:31.530 --> 11:34.430
<i>Congressman David Norris.</i>

11:38.070 --> 11:40.270
<i>I grew up not far away
from here, in Red Hook.</i>

11:40.340 --> 11:42.430
Brooklyn!
I love you, David!

11:42.510 --> 11:44.170
I love you more!

11:44.250 --> 11:45.640
<i>I love you both.</i>

11:46.950 --> 11:49.610
<i>But we had a rule
in my neighborhood.</i>

11:49.750 --> 11:52.310
<i>When you got in a fight,</i>

11:53.320 --> 11:56.450
<i>it wasn't whether or not
you got knocked down,</i>

11:56.520 --> 12:00.430
<i>it's what you do
when you get back up.</i>

12:04.270 --> 12:06.100
<i>And I came here
to tell you tonight,</i>

12:06.170 --> 12:09.000
<i>that I will get back up.</i>

12:25.720 --> 12:27.120
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

12:27.790 --> 12:30.420
<i>We didn't have that saying
in my neighborhood.</i>

12:31.130 --> 12:33.650
<i>It's just one
of those phrases</i>

12:35.130 --> 12:37.360
<i>that had some traction
with the focus group</i>

12:37.430 --> 12:40.400
<i>and so we kept using it,
but it's not true.</i>

12:40.470 --> 12:43.340
<i>In 1998, I did a
cover story for GQ.</i>

12:43.400 --> 12:46.500
<i>The title was
"Youngest Congressman Ever. "</i>

12:46.570 --> 12:48.410
<i>And since then,
every story has tried</i>

12:48.510 --> 12:51.380
<i>to explain how
I got here so fast.</i>

12:53.080 --> 12:57.580
<i>And the word that people
kept using was "authentic. "</i>

13:00.190 --> 13:03.210
<i>But here's the problem.</i>

13:05.390 --> 13:07.660
<i>This isn't even my tie.</i>

13:08.500 --> 13:10.520
<i>Go get Jim for me.
This tie was selected for me</i>

13:10.600 --> 13:14.690
<i>by a group of specialists
in Tenafly, New Jersey</i>

13:14.770 --> 13:18.710
<i>who chose it over
56 other ties we tested.</i>

13:18.940 --> 13:23.140
<i>In fact, our data suggests
that I have to stick to</i>

13:23.340 --> 13:27.080
<i>either a tie that is red
or a tie that is blue.</i>

13:27.180 --> 13:30.810
<i>A yellow tie made it look as if
I was taking my situation lightly,</i>

13:30.890 --> 13:33.450
<i>and I may in fact, pull my
pants down again at any moment.</i>

13:35.260 --> 13:38.560
<i>A silver tie meant that
I'd forgotten my roots.</i>

13:39.830 --> 13:41.760
<i>My shoes...</i>

13:41.830 --> 13:43.730
<i>You know, shiny shoes,</i>

13:43.800 --> 13:48.740
<i>we associate with high-priced
lawyers and bankers.</i>

13:49.240 --> 13:50.700
<i>If you want to get
a working man's vote,</i>

13:50.770 --> 13:52.400
<i>you need to scuff up
your shoes a little bit.</i>

13:52.540 --> 13:53.910
<i>But you can't scuff
them up so much</i>

13:53.980 --> 13:55.570
<i>that you alienate the
lawyers and the bankers</i>

13:55.640 --> 13:58.810
<i>because you need them to pay for
the specialists back in Tenafly.</i>

13:59.550 --> 14:02.020
<i>So, what is the proper
scuffing amount?</i>

14:02.080 --> 14:06.210
<i>Do you know we actually paid
a consultant $7,300...</i>

14:06.350 --> 14:07.980
<i>Was it $7,300, Charlie?</i>

14:08.060 --> 14:09.850
Nice. What an asshole.

14:09.920 --> 14:15.620
<i>$7,300, for a consultant to tell us that
this is the perfect amount of scuffing.</i>

14:52.530 --> 14:55.330
He has to spill his coffee
on his shirt by 7:05.

14:56.870 --> 14:58.130
7:05 at the latest.

14:58.210 --> 15:00.900
I'll get him as soon
as he enters the park.

15:02.310 --> 15:05.800
Can't imagine being on this
guy as long as you have.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.890
<i>...for energy
efficient technologies.</i>

15:22.960 --> 15:24.990
<i>RSR Venture Capital
announced yesterday</i>

15:25.070 --> 15:28.470
<i>that former Congressman David
Norris, would become a senior partner.</i>

15:28.540 --> 15:31.660
<i>Norris led an unsuccessful
bid for Senate last month.</i>

15:31.740 --> 15:35.330
<i>But his concession speech was
considered, by many, to be electrifying</i>

15:35.410 --> 15:39.350
<i>and has made him the obvious front
runner in the 2010 Senate race.</i>

15:39.410 --> 15:42.140
<i>Investment banker
Charles Traynor founded RSR,</i>

15:42.220 --> 15:45.210
<i>one of the country's most
successful venture capital firms.</i>

15:45.450 --> 15:47.440
<i>Traynor is a childhood
friend of Norris'</i>

15:47.520 --> 15:49.650
<i>and was the Chairman of
his Senate campaign. Hey!</i>

15:49.720 --> 15:51.890
<i>Hey. Tom Frankel from The Journal
is calling you in five minutes.</i>

15:51.960 --> 15:53.150
I just gave him this number.

15:53.290 --> 15:56.590
Give him 3-2-2-7. I'm not
used to this phone yet.

15:56.730 --> 15:58.960
<i>No, I can't. He's going to
ask you about joining the firm.</i>

15:59.030 --> 16:01.470
<i>All business calls have to be
done on a company Blackberry.</i>

16:01.540 --> 16:03.630
<i>Really?
Sarbanes-Oxley,</i>

16:03.700 --> 16:06.830
you voted for it, pal. In
fact, you co-sponsored that one.

16:06.910 --> 16:08.770
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

16:08.980 --> 16:10.440
Hey, I just
saw you on TV.

16:10.510 --> 16:11.570
<i>Really?
Yeah.</i>

16:11.680 --> 16:12.700
What did they say?

16:12.780 --> 16:13.770
You're bald.

16:13.850 --> 16:15.580
Nice.

16:15.650 --> 16:18.120
<i>Yeah, it was weird, too,
because it was a financial show.</i>

16:18.220 --> 16:21.660
But they were really captivated
by your receding hairline.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.490
<i>I got to go,
you jack-off.</i>

16:23.560 --> 16:24.620
Bye.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.690
Congressman.

16:31.770 --> 16:34.760
I have to tell you, I really
admire what you did last month.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.060
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

16:36.140 --> 16:37.830
I wish there were more
politicians like you.

16:37.910 --> 16:39.630
Thank you.
I'm retired now.

16:39.710 --> 16:40.870
I had to go
get a real job.

16:40.940 --> 16:42.840
You'll do well.
Thank you.

17:13.910 --> 17:15.170
Hey!

17:16.980 --> 17:18.470
You got a guy
running for the bus.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.140
There is another M6
right behind me.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.440
Hey!

17:25.020 --> 17:26.849
No way.

17:36.830 --> 17:37.890
Sorry.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.900
Oh, my God.

17:44.110 --> 17:45.230
Have we met?

17:45.310 --> 17:47.070
You look vaguely familiar.

17:47.510 --> 17:49.440
Waldorf men's room.
You got it.

17:49.510 --> 17:51.710
Were you just staring
at my legs while I slept?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.810
I was defenseless
against the small dress.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.140
It's a skirt.

17:56.220 --> 17:58.010
It's a belt.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.490
What is it with you
and the argyle?

18:03.590 --> 18:06.060
What is the deal with you
and the boring shades of blue?

18:06.130 --> 18:07.190
My clothes match.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.790
Did your team pick
that out for you?

18:08.860 --> 18:10.190
No team. Team is gone.

18:10.260 --> 18:11.930
Wow.
I did it all by myself.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.540
I saw your speech.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.700
Yeah, the speech.

18:17.770 --> 18:19.930
Something must
have got into me.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.300
Wow, that is something.

18:24.150 --> 18:26.380
Really augments
the moment.

18:26.450 --> 18:27.470
Nice ring, asshole.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.020
Hello? Hello?

18:30.180 --> 18:31.240
It doesn't even work.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.580
Could that ringer
get louder

18:32.650 --> 18:33.750
or do you have
that maxed out?

18:33.850 --> 18:34.880
It's a new phone.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.120
Are you going
to run again?

18:40.190 --> 18:42.750
Don't know. I'm
starting a new job today.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.030
You have to run again.
You can't do that.

18:45.100 --> 18:48.070
The country will end up being
run by tools like Linfield.

18:48.140 --> 18:49.160
It kind of is.

18:58.410 --> 18:59.470
Oh, shit.

19:01.620 --> 19:03.480
Sorry. I don't
know what just happened.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.020
Are you okay?

19:14.090 --> 19:16.060
I'm fine. Can you
hand me that?

19:16.130 --> 19:18.220
You sure you okay?
Yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.130
I'll pay for the dry
cleaning. No, it's really fine.

19:24.210 --> 19:25.640
Please don't. Wow.

19:25.710 --> 19:28.040
Seven bucks will
probably cover it.

19:28.110 --> 19:30.010
You keep that,
you might need it.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.170
You know what? Here.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.410
You write your number down

19:32.480 --> 19:34.710
then I can call you and
come pick up your skirt.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.610
Oh, my goodness, me.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.120
That is very smooth.

19:45.030 --> 19:46.190
Oh, shit.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.200
Why don't you let me spill some
on you and then we'll be even?

19:50.260 --> 19:52.100
That's a terrible idea.
I think it's a great idea.

19:52.170 --> 19:53.260
Just one bit because
that's not fair.

19:53.330 --> 19:55.730
You actually are crazy.
No, now it all makes sense.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.500
Okay, hang on. Oh, jeez.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.900
He's not here.
I know, I'm sorry.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.630
Who was that?
I don't know. Who cares?

20:03.710 --> 20:05.740
It'll be on the... Can you just... No.

20:05.810 --> 20:08.680
Okay, now we're in the
third grade. This is great.

20:12.450 --> 20:14.940
It's a sturdy little
fucker, isn't it?

20:15.020 --> 20:18.820
I'm sorry. I don't know what
happened, it just happened.

20:19.630 --> 20:20.750
Okay.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.820
Okay, that was a new phone.
Let's wipe it off.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.830
I'm Elise, by the way.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.130
I'll remember that.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.940
That's my number.
Terrific, thank you.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.840
I'll call you.

20:39.710 --> 20:40.870
The morning
after the election,

20:40.950 --> 20:42.380
I woke up thinking
about you.

20:58.830 --> 20:59.700
Hey, man, what's up?

20:59.770 --> 21:01.460
<i>You're not going to believe
who I just ran into.</i>

21:01.570 --> 21:02.590
Who?

21:02.670 --> 21:03.760
The girl from
election night.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.670
<i>The one you kissed?
She kissed me.</i>

21:05.740 --> 21:06.900
<i>You still sticking
with that story?</i>

21:06.970 --> 21:08.500
<i>It's the truth.
Whatever, dude.</i>

21:08.580 --> 21:10.340
They're ready for you
in the main conference room.

21:10.410 --> 21:12.280
<i>What are the odds?
It's amazing.</i>

21:12.350 --> 21:15.440
That's great, man, just don't take
her advice on speeches anymore.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.350
First time worked,
it's not going to work again.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.940
You're just jealous because
it's the best speech I ever gave

21:20.020 --> 21:21.110
and you didn't write it.

21:21.190 --> 21:24.390
Just so you know, I think I'm coming
down against your solar panel thing.

21:24.460 --> 21:25.790
<i>Why?</i>

21:25.860 --> 21:27.450
I just don't think
the research is there

21:27.530 --> 21:29.550
and the price point is too
high on these things.

21:29.630 --> 21:30.790
<i>Of course,
it's too high.</i>

21:30.860 --> 21:33.420
<i>But if our company doesn't get
involved with stuff like this, who will?</i>

21:33.500 --> 21:34.800
Convince me in the meeting.

21:34.870 --> 21:37.000
I will. See you, buddy.

21:53.220 --> 21:54.740
Hey, Janet.

22:01.260 --> 22:02.850
Hey, Susan.

22:14.110 --> 22:17.640
We just got approval for a
recalibration on the Lasalle case.

22:17.710 --> 22:19.010
Two minutes.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.040
Hey!

22:25.020 --> 22:26.250
What the hell
are you doing?

22:28.160 --> 22:29.210
Grab him.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.330
9-1-1, Janet! 9-1-1! Oh.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.010
You can't get away, David.

23:03.220 --> 23:05.280
David, I really wish
you'd just listen to me.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.130
All right,
I'll handle it.

23:24.110 --> 23:25.670
David,

23:25.750 --> 23:28.110
you really are making this
harder than it has to be.

23:36.360 --> 23:39.050
All right, take it
easy, guys. Take it easy.

23:39.530 --> 23:41.120
Take it easy.

23:42.060 --> 23:43.090
It's okay, David.

23:51.370 --> 23:53.170
No. No, sir.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.830
It's being taken care of.

23:57.380 --> 24:00.370
Yes, sir. It's being
taken care of.

24:00.850 --> 24:02.910
Yes, sir. No, sir.

24:03.380 --> 24:06.510
No, sir. Yes, sir.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.250
I understand.
I'll take care of it.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.720
What a goddamn mess.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.820
Donaldson?
Yes.

24:14.190 --> 24:15.920
McCRADY: What do
you want to do?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.630
We have to reset him.
Call for a briefcase.

24:19.270 --> 24:21.760
McCRADY: You kidding? It's going to
take a signed order from the Chairman.

24:21.840 --> 24:22.890
Get legal on it.

24:22.970 --> 24:24.670
Legal just arrived.

24:25.810 --> 24:28.100
There's no way the
Chairman approves a reset.

24:28.180 --> 24:31.010
This is your fault. There is
no way you get a briefcase.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.100
Hey.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.480
What are my options?
Hey.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.840
Just bullshit him.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.350
Bullshit this guy?

24:36.420 --> 24:39.210
Hey! What's going on here?

24:39.290 --> 24:40.450
Look at this.

24:40.550 --> 24:43.080
Questions will burn in him
till the day he dies.

24:44.020 --> 24:47.150
He won't stop searching
for answers. He won't quit.

24:47.290 --> 24:49.130
We have to watch him

24:49.260 --> 24:51.730
forever, make sure
he doesn't talk.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.960
Endless ripple effects.

24:54.030 --> 24:56.830
You remember the Torres
case 40 years ago?

24:57.070 --> 25:00.060
It's not that bad, is it?

25:01.240 --> 25:03.970
In the end, they just
leveled with him.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.240
Completely?

25:05.310 --> 25:07.250
Looking at that, I don't
see you have a choice.

25:07.310 --> 25:09.250
Who the hell
are you guys?

25:11.250 --> 25:12.280
We

25:14.320 --> 25:17.150
are the people who make sure
things happen according to plan.

25:17.860 --> 25:19.350
My name is Richardson.

25:19.430 --> 25:20.420
Oh.

25:35.980 --> 25:38.310
You really think I
couldn't see that coming?

25:38.380 --> 25:39.970
I can read your mind.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.040
Yeah, really.

25:42.550 --> 25:43.680
Pick a color.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.940
Blue.

25:45.020 --> 25:46.180
Pick a number. Seventeen.

25:46.990 --> 25:49.550
Now, why are you still
thinking about running?

25:52.890 --> 25:55.330
I don't really know
what's going on here.

25:55.560 --> 25:56.820
You've just seen
behind a curtain

25:56.930 --> 25:58.990
that you weren't supposed
to know existed.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.300
Must be jarring.

26:01.370 --> 26:02.840
It's not your fault.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.330
Your path through
the world this morning

26:04.400 --> 26:05.930
was supposed
to have been adjusted.

26:06.610 --> 26:07.870
You were supposed
to spill your coffee

26:07.940 --> 26:09.910
as you entered
the park this morning.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.540
You would have gone
upstairs to change,

26:11.610 --> 26:13.010
you would have
missed the bus,

26:13.080 --> 26:15.310
and you would have
arrived at work

26:15.380 --> 26:17.320
10 minutes later
than you did,

26:17.380 --> 26:19.050
and we would
have been gone.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.980
I was supposed
to spill my coffee?

26:21.050 --> 26:23.250
We call that
an adjustment.

26:23.390 --> 26:25.380
See, sometimes, when
people spill their coffee

26:25.460 --> 26:26.720
or their Internet goes out

26:26.790 --> 26:29.420
or they misplaced their keys,
they think it's chance.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.330
And sometimes it is.

26:31.470 --> 26:33.590
Sometimes it's us...

26:33.670 --> 26:35.970
...nudging people
back on plan.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.270
Sometimes when
nudging isn't enough,

26:39.340 --> 26:42.330
management authorizes
a recalibration.

26:42.410 --> 26:45.140
We deploy our
Intervention Team

26:45.210 --> 26:47.410
and they change
your mind for you,

26:47.480 --> 26:49.950
like we did with
your friend Charlie.

26:52.290 --> 26:53.620
He's fine, by the way.

26:53.690 --> 26:55.210
You don't need
to worry about him.

26:55.290 --> 26:56.690
Now...

26:57.690 --> 27:00.850
There is something I need you to
understand if I'm going to let you go.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.720
Okay.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.490
Very few humans have seen
what you've seen today,

27:04.560 --> 27:05.960
and we're determined
to keep it that way.

27:06.030 --> 27:09.490
So, if you ever
reveal our existence,

27:10.240 --> 27:12.070
we'll erase your brain.

27:12.170 --> 27:14.640
The Intervention
Team will reset you.

27:14.940 --> 27:17.140
Your emotions,
your memories,

27:17.210 --> 27:19.940
your entire personality
will be expunged.

27:20.110 --> 27:22.210
Your friends and family will
think you've gone crazy.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.080
You won't think anything.

27:31.690 --> 27:33.460
You understand?

27:35.360 --> 27:37.990
Not one word about us.

27:39.070 --> 27:40.400
Okay.

27:40.470 --> 27:44.130
Oh, one more thing, you bumped into
a woman this morning on the bus.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.260
Elise?

27:45.770 --> 27:48.100
What does that have
to do with anything?

27:48.210 --> 27:50.230
You were never supposed
to see her again.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.300
What does that matter?

27:54.410 --> 27:56.180
Because it matters.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.580
McCRADY: It's in his wallet.
Hey, hey. God! Hey!

28:01.090 --> 28:03.490
What's with you guys?
Jesus!

28:06.590 --> 28:09.590
Oh, come on. No! No!

28:10.060 --> 28:11.790
What the hell?

28:13.030 --> 28:14.520
Really?

28:15.740 --> 28:17.760
What the hell?

28:18.810 --> 28:20.430
Okay.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.240
Okay.
Take him back.

28:24.310 --> 28:25.370
Enjoy the rest
of your day.

28:25.450 --> 28:27.880
I can walk.
I'm capable of walking.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.360
Dude, what are you
doing on my floor?

28:42.460 --> 28:45.230
You know, I called you like 10
times, you could have picked up.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.200
Christine, I found him.
He's in my office.

28:51.270 --> 28:52.600
What the hell
are you doing?

28:54.710 --> 28:57.470
Round up the guys, we're
going to do the meeting now.

28:58.710 --> 28:59.910
You have a headache?

29:00.450 --> 29:01.740
What is wrong with you?

29:05.250 --> 29:08.190
Hey, we're in the big
conference room on 17. Let's go.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.760
Morning, Congressman.

29:20.170 --> 29:21.460
You sure you're okay?

29:21.540 --> 29:23.200
Yeah, you?

29:23.270 --> 29:24.360
I'm great, why?

29:24.470 --> 29:26.100
You don't have
a headache or anything?

29:26.170 --> 29:28.000
No, I feel fantastic, man.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.600
Is it me or this
an odd conversation?

29:30.980 --> 29:32.410
On David's
solar panel deal,

29:32.480 --> 29:33.810
our tech guy has
serious doubts

29:33.950 --> 29:35.940
about the efficiency
ratings they're claiming.

29:36.020 --> 29:38.250
They'd need a 20-fold improvement
over anything anyone else

29:38.320 --> 29:41.810
has been able to manufacture at that
price point to really be a game-changer.

29:42.420 --> 29:45.120
You're opposed to this anyway,
Charlie. And with these financials...

29:45.190 --> 29:47.290
Whoa, whoa.
I know it's a risk,

29:47.360 --> 29:51.420
but if our company doesn't take a chance
on something like this, then who will?

29:51.570 --> 29:55.520
I mean, I'm willing to take a fire on
something that could change the world.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.800
Not to mention,
be incredibly lucrative.

30:05.380 --> 30:06.540
David?

30:09.550 --> 30:13.820
Yeah, I mean, it's why
I took the job here.

30:15.390 --> 30:16.720
All right.

30:16.790 --> 30:18.620
Let's do it.

30:22.230 --> 30:24.560
Come into my office
for a second.

30:29.570 --> 30:31.200
Something is wrong.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.730
A couple of hours ago you miraculously
reunite with the girl of your dreams.

30:34.810 --> 30:37.640
Explain to me why you don't have
an ear-to-ear grin right now.

30:44.620 --> 30:46.590
I lost her number.

30:46.650 --> 30:47.750
What?

30:49.490 --> 30:51.720
The woman on the bus.

30:51.790 --> 30:56.790
I lost her phone number and all
I had was her first name, so,

30:58.630 --> 31:00.730
I'm never going
to see her again.

31:03.340 --> 31:04.670
I'm sorry.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.330
Wow, I'm really sorry.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.050
Your entire world
is turned upside down

31:55.120 --> 31:57.350
and you're thinking
about a woman.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.980
Even if you could
remember the number,

32:01.060 --> 32:02.590
you'll never get through.

32:02.660 --> 32:04.890
Lost cell phone,
changed numbers,

32:04.970 --> 32:07.230
whatever creates
the fewest ripples.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.490
My name is Harry,
by the way.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.960
The fewest ripples?

32:15.640 --> 32:18.610
You freeze people.
You froze my friend.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.580
We need special
authorization to...

32:20.650 --> 32:22.210
Poke around in
people's brains.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.340
You make them think
whatever you want...

32:23.420 --> 32:24.640
Be quiet, David.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.780
Can I get you something?

32:25.850 --> 32:27.790
Just some water, please.

32:27.850 --> 32:29.910
Your friend will be fine.

32:29.990 --> 32:34.320
Recalibrations make tiny
changes in the way people reason.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.030
It doesn't work on
emotion or personality.

32:37.530 --> 32:38.720
That's too intrusive.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.160
You said authorization.
Authorization from who?

32:41.230 --> 32:42.500
The Chairman.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.590
The Chairman?

32:44.970 --> 32:47.030
That's just
a name we use.

32:47.670 --> 32:49.870
You use many other names.

32:53.480 --> 32:54.670
We can't talk here.

32:56.650 --> 33:00.420
Meet me on the 4:00 p. m. boat
and I'll answer what I can.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.920
If you reveal us, even
if it's unintentional...

33:04.990 --> 33:06.750
I know. You'll bump
me on the head.

33:06.830 --> 33:10.790
Richardson has automatic
authority to reset you.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.760
You mean lobotomize me?

33:13.830 --> 33:15.800
Try not to forget it.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.630
Be on the 4:00 p. m. boat.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.620
Ask your questions,
I'll tell you what I can.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.520
What were they
doing to Charlie?

33:40.590 --> 33:43.460
Just changing the way
he weighs investment risks

33:43.530 --> 33:47.660
which will subtly shift the direction
of his company in the way upstairs wants.

33:47.870 --> 33:49.960
So, Richardson could
read my mind?

33:50.040 --> 33:51.900
Richardson was trying
to scare you.

33:51.970 --> 33:54.600
No, he knew the number I
was thinking of, the color.

33:54.670 --> 33:56.470
Because he set it up
as a choice.

33:56.540 --> 33:58.670
"Choose a color,
choose a number. ' '

33:58.780 --> 34:01.750
We can't read your mind
or hear your thoughts.

34:02.150 --> 34:05.450
When you make a decision,
your mind weighs options.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.850
We can perceive them.

34:06.990 --> 34:09.580
We know when you're going to
go off the plan or not because

34:09.659 --> 34:11.210
if we're close enough,

34:11.290 --> 34:13.230
we can sense when
it's going to happen.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.389
We're just here
to keep you on plan.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.330
That's all we're
authorized to do.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.659
Are you allowed to be
telling me this stuff?

34:19.730 --> 34:21.600
Are they following me now?

34:21.699 --> 34:23.730
We have to monitor
the entire world.

34:24.469 --> 34:27.770
We don't have the manpower to
follow everyone all the time.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.780
And there is
something about water.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.710
It blocks our ability
to read your decision tree.

34:33.850 --> 34:35.840
Are you an angel?

34:36.780 --> 34:38.080
We've been called that.

34:38.590 --> 34:40.449
We're more like
case officers

34:40.590 --> 34:43.280
who live a lot longer
than humans.

34:43.489 --> 34:44.960
Why are you helping me?

34:45.090 --> 34:46.650
I have my reasons.

34:48.190 --> 34:49.920
And why won't they
let me be with Elise?

34:50.500 --> 34:54.020
All I know is the amount
of resources they've used

34:54.100 --> 34:57.730
keeping you from her is
pretty damn important to them.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.030
You're going to look
for her, aren't you?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.910
You won't find her.

35:04.980 --> 35:07.110
They'll make sure of it.

35:07.780 --> 35:10.180
<i>Even if they weren't
trying to stop you,</i>

35:10.250 --> 35:13.340
<i>there are nine million
people in this city.</i>

35:13.420 --> 35:15.450
<i>You'll never find her.</i>

35:16.660 --> 35:18.560
<i>Forget about her.</i>

35:18.630 --> 35:20.620
<i>Move on with your life.</i>

36:40.940 --> 36:42.930
Stop!
Stop the bus!

36:57.190 --> 36:59.220
Elise? Elise, hi.

36:59.290 --> 37:01.020
David.

37:01.090 --> 37:05.050
You know, I rode the M6 to
work every day for three years

37:05.130 --> 37:07.730
hoping that I'd
bump into you.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.170
Listen, is there a place
we could go and talk?

37:13.070 --> 37:15.670
Don't you have to get
to work or something?

37:15.740 --> 37:16.870
I just got sick.

37:16.940 --> 37:18.740
"I haven't seen you in three
years, you make me sick. ' '

37:18.810 --> 37:20.680
That's not an ideal come-on,
just so you know.

37:20.810 --> 37:21.940
What are you looking for?

37:22.020 --> 37:23.880
I felt like someone
was watching us.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.580
Hey, Charlie, I'm going
to have to skip breakfast,

37:26.650 --> 37:29.590
and I probably have to postpone the
speech, too. I just bumped into Elise.

37:29.660 --> 37:31.150
You just hung up
on your friend.

37:31.220 --> 37:32.620
We've known each other
since we were kids.

37:32.690 --> 37:33.990
What speech?
It doesn't matter.

37:34.060 --> 37:35.990
You want to take a walk?
No.

37:36.060 --> 37:37.120
We have a lot
to catch up on.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.530
I don't think you should
cancel your speech.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.570
What if I don't like you
at the end of our walk?

37:40.700 --> 37:42.070
I'll take my chances.

37:42.140 --> 37:43.690
Seriously, my number
hasn't changed,

37:43.770 --> 37:45.760
just call me like
you didn't last time.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.570
Look, if you take a walk
with me, I'll explain why.

37:49.340 --> 37:52.900
It's been years. How do you know
I don't have a nice boyfriend?

37:52.980 --> 37:54.880
Do you have
a nice boyfriend?

37:54.950 --> 37:56.280
Would it matter if I did?

37:56.350 --> 37:57.340
Yeah.

37:57.420 --> 37:59.390
So you don't have any
real conviction then?

37:59.450 --> 38:00.750
Okay, it wouldn't
matter at all.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.880
So, you don't mind
being a home-wrecker?

38:02.960 --> 38:04.050
Congressman!

38:04.120 --> 38:06.520
How are you doing, man? I'm
from Red Hook. You're the best.

38:06.590 --> 38:08.560
Thank you.
Good to see you.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.030
If you were married,
then it would bother me.

38:12.270 --> 38:15.200
But now you're just saying
what you think I want to hear.

38:15.770 --> 38:17.200
I'm single.

38:17.270 --> 38:20.210
Now let's hear your bullshit
excuse for not calling me.

38:20.270 --> 38:21.300
I didn't have your number.

38:21.370 --> 38:22.970
I gave it you on the bus.
Handed it to you.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.980
I was mugged.
It was taken from me.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.240
No, come on.

38:26.310 --> 38:28.610
My wallet was taken.
Come on.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.580
Why else would I fawn
all over you on a bus

38:30.650 --> 38:32.020
three years ago and
then never call you?

38:32.090 --> 38:35.020
Because, I don't know! You have a
girlfriend and you felt terrible.

38:35.090 --> 38:38.820
Listen, I swear to you that
I did not have your number.

38:38.890 --> 38:39.950
All right.

38:40.030 --> 38:42.590
No, on my
parents' graves.

38:42.660 --> 38:43.650
That's heavy.

38:43.730 --> 38:45.130
That's too heavy,
I know, but it's true.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.790
I didn't have your number.

38:46.870 --> 38:48.730
And I didn't even have
a last name to go by.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.830
If you google just "Elise,"

38:50.900 --> 38:54.130
you get 757,000 hits.
You did not.

38:54.210 --> 38:55.670
And none of them are you.

39:06.990 --> 39:08.450
We have a problem.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.780
What?

39:10.060 --> 39:11.350
David Norris is off plan.

39:12.090 --> 39:15.190
Son of a bitch.
How did he find her?

39:15.260 --> 39:18.030
Chance. Just spotted
her on the street.

39:18.100 --> 39:20.290
We never should have let him
meet her in the first place.

39:20.370 --> 39:22.600
We followed protocol
to the letter.

39:22.670 --> 39:25.300
Guy rides the same bus
every day for three years.

39:25.370 --> 39:26.860
Who does that?

39:29.880 --> 39:32.440
Three years later, I'm
still cleaning up your mess.

39:39.850 --> 39:42.720
Let's cut the power
at her dance studio.

39:43.620 --> 39:44.720
I'm a dancer.

39:44.790 --> 39:45.820
Oh.

39:45.890 --> 39:47.520
Not like that,
you pervert.

39:47.590 --> 39:49.250
I'm in a contemporary
ballet company.

39:49.330 --> 39:50.990
I think you have
the wrong idea about me.

39:51.060 --> 39:53.620
No, I think that was the first thing
that crossed your mind, actually.

39:53.770 --> 39:56.200
I think you should invite me
to one of your performances.

39:56.270 --> 39:58.070
The company is
called Cedar Lake,

39:58.140 --> 40:01.300
and there is actually a show
tomorrow night, if you want.

40:01.370 --> 40:03.400
Is that an invitation?
No, it's information.

40:03.540 --> 40:05.240
We're covering the girl's
artistic director

40:05.340 --> 40:07.280
and we're still working
on Charlie Traynor.

40:07.350 --> 40:09.180
This whole thing will
be over in an hour.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.380
Hi, how are you?
Paul, right?

40:11.480 --> 40:12.640
How did
you remember that?

40:12.720 --> 40:14.120
I'm a politician,
I'm good with names.

40:14.190 --> 40:16.350
Her decision tree is
diverging from our models.

40:16.420 --> 40:17.410
It's just
the two of you?

40:17.490 --> 40:18.680
Yes.

40:18.890 --> 40:20.260
Thirty-six hours
without contact,

40:20.330 --> 40:21.590
she'll never speak
to him again.

40:21.660 --> 40:22.720
Look at her file.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.060
It's the last thing in the
world she'll put up with.

40:25.130 --> 40:28.260
No, something's wrong. I'm
already seeing inflection points.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.700
You okay?

40:32.770 --> 40:34.030
Yeah.

40:36.980 --> 40:40.140
We're in motion on changing
the location of her rehearsal.

40:41.650 --> 40:43.270
You have to be born
with the right body

40:43.350 --> 40:46.320
like very flexible hips
and shoulders and long neck.

40:46.390 --> 40:47.410
And you weren't?

40:47.490 --> 40:49.150
No, I was.
I was lucky.

40:49.290 --> 40:52.750
But after 15 years of that
precision and the training...

40:52.830 --> 40:54.020
How is everything
over here?

40:54.090 --> 40:55.420
It's great. Thank you.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.220
It's good,
thank you.

40:59.370 --> 41:02.330
So, I wanted to try
something else just on my own,

41:02.400 --> 41:05.100
open-ended and
human, I guess.

41:05.170 --> 41:06.900
What do you mean?

41:07.970 --> 41:09.100
Look.

41:11.210 --> 41:12.700
What's this?

41:12.780 --> 41:14.210
If they kiss.

41:14.410 --> 41:17.010
A kiss?
That's all it takes?

41:17.080 --> 41:18.210
A real kiss.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.910
If that happens, every
possible adjustment

41:19.990 --> 41:21.080
strong enough
to break them up

41:21.150 --> 41:23.710
will cause ripples
over your limit.

41:24.920 --> 41:26.410
I think that everything
you go through in life

41:26.490 --> 41:28.520
should come out in
the way that you dance.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.490
I haven't found that to be
the case with my dancing.

41:32.470 --> 41:33.660
It's a shame.

41:34.070 --> 41:36.690
David,
hate to interrupt.

41:36.770 --> 41:38.700
Hi. Hi, nice to see you again, Elise.

41:38.810 --> 41:39.900
How did you find me?

41:39.970 --> 41:41.130
Does it matter?

41:42.040 --> 41:43.030
Nice work.

41:43.110 --> 41:45.410
There's a crowd of people waiting
for your announcement speech

41:45.480 --> 41:46.780
at the Brooklyn Bridge
right now.

41:46.850 --> 41:48.910
You're announcing today?
You can't skip this for me.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.540
I know. I told you I'm not
going to let you out of my sight.

41:51.620 --> 41:53.520
David, what the hell?
Do you want to come?

41:53.590 --> 41:54.750
Do you want to watch?

41:54.820 --> 41:57.310
No. I can't, I have
to go and rehearse.

41:57.420 --> 41:59.250
Actually, I just heard that
they're moving my rehearsal

41:59.330 --> 42:00.990
to Pier 17, right
next to the bridge.

42:01.060 --> 42:04.030
Why don't we just postpone it?
We'll do the speech another time.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.500
No, David, come on,
you can't do that.

42:05.570 --> 42:06.590
Thank you.

42:06.670 --> 42:07.930
You have to go.
Check.

42:08.870 --> 42:10.460
David, she's
rehearsing so close.

42:10.540 --> 42:12.230
It'll take you three minutes
to get there after the speech.

42:12.310 --> 42:13.500
All right.

42:13.570 --> 42:15.270
Just come over
when you're done.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.110
Keep the change.
Thank you.

42:18.180 --> 42:21.310
Have Charlie's aide
call him now.

42:23.050 --> 42:24.280
Are you sure
you don't want a ride?

42:24.350 --> 42:26.080
No, I have to go
home and change.

42:26.150 --> 42:28.810
You're so late.
Your friend is about to cry.

42:28.890 --> 42:30.250
I'm wrangling him
right now.

42:31.190 --> 42:32.250
Yeah, I know.

42:33.230 --> 42:34.850
Shifting her rehearsal
to Pier 17

42:34.930 --> 42:36.120
was a genius move.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.330
We're not out of
the woods yet.

42:38.870 --> 42:40.030
Come over when
you're done.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.590
David.
Okay.

42:44.670 --> 42:47.100
Sorry, the TV crew is there.
We got to go, man.

42:53.150 --> 42:54.540
We're okay.

42:56.750 --> 42:57.910
Look, whatever happens,

42:57.980 --> 43:00.150
I'm not going to let anything
come between us again.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.880
Okay.

43:04.060 --> 43:05.610
I'll see you soon.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.360
Hey, how you doing?

43:16.170 --> 43:18.300
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

43:18.370 --> 43:19.960
How are you?

43:21.940 --> 43:23.670
Thanks a lot.
Good to see you, too.

43:26.750 --> 43:28.210
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:31.750 --> 43:34.780
<i>I have to say, it's good
to be back in Brooklyn.</i>

43:37.020 --> 43:38.750
<i>There's been a lot
of speculation</i>

43:38.820 --> 43:40.310
<i>as to whether or not...
McCRADY: It's done.</i>

43:40.390 --> 43:42.830
<i>...I would run for a Senate seat
here in the state of New York.</i>

43:42.960 --> 43:45.520
<i>I came here today to put
an end to that speculation</i>

43:45.600 --> 43:47.500
<i>and to tell you,
unequivocally,</i>

43:47.570 --> 43:51.660
<i>I will seek the Senate seat
for the great state of New York.</i>

43:55.040 --> 43:57.700
David! David!

44:08.520 --> 44:09.950
Shit.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.830
Don't forget, I added
the bankers' group

44:13.890 --> 44:15.420
<i>after The Daily Show
tomorrow.</i>

44:17.300 --> 44:18.700
Are you listening to me?

44:21.030 --> 44:22.060
David?

44:26.740 --> 44:29.000
I cannot get a break
on this case.

44:33.710 --> 44:36.940
Okay. I got
to get to Pier 17.

44:37.020 --> 44:39.110
Do the interview and you
can do whatever you want.

44:39.190 --> 44:41.090
Just handle the interviews for
me. I'll talk to those guys...

44:41.150 --> 44:42.450
This has got to go
on the nightly news.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.990
I got to see Elise
right now.

44:44.060 --> 44:45.110
Every time we get close,

44:45.190 --> 44:47.160
you do something
to mess this up.

44:48.290 --> 44:49.780
This is different.

45:13.150 --> 45:14.180
<i>City, please?</i>

45:14.250 --> 45:15.350
Manhattan.

45:15.420 --> 45:16.750
<i>What listing?</i>

45:16.820 --> 45:18.690
Cedar Lake.
It's a dance company.

45:20.490 --> 45:21.760
<i>Connecting.</i>

45:34.570 --> 45:37.100
He's going to ask the parking
attendant to use the hard line.

45:37.180 --> 45:38.700
I already killed it.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.180
Excuse me,
can I use your phone?

45:40.250 --> 45:41.800
I have an emergency.

45:48.390 --> 45:49.720
McCRADY: Restaurant
across the street.

45:49.790 --> 45:50.950
Mmm-hmm.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.420
I took out everything
for three blocks.

45:53.490 --> 45:55.220
This guy is
a pain in the ass.

45:55.290 --> 45:58.160
Come on,
let's go talk to him.

46:01.070 --> 46:03.040
There is a whole world
of women out there.

46:03.100 --> 46:04.970
I thought we established
this one was off limits.

46:05.640 --> 46:08.200
It's been a while,
I must have forgotten.

46:08.270 --> 46:10.240
Doesn't change the fact.

46:11.640 --> 46:12.910
You put us
together three times.

46:13.350 --> 46:15.370
That wasn't us,
that was just chance.

46:16.780 --> 46:18.040
Why do you want
to keep us apart?

46:18.120 --> 46:19.380
Because the plan says so.

46:19.450 --> 46:20.980
Then you misread the plan.

46:21.050 --> 46:23.350
There is no misreading the plan
when it comes to you and Elise.

46:23.420 --> 46:24.550
Then the plan is wrong.

46:24.620 --> 46:25.990
Do you know who wrote it?
I don't care.

46:26.060 --> 46:29.360
You should. You should
really show a little respect.

46:33.370 --> 46:34.700
If I'm not supposed
to be with her,

46:34.770 --> 46:36.030
how come I feel like this?

46:36.170 --> 46:38.260
It doesn't matter
how you feel.

46:38.340 --> 46:40.860
What matters is what
is in black and white.

46:46.910 --> 46:49.880
You don't know why I'm not
supposed to be with her, do you?

46:51.480 --> 46:54.280
That's why you can't
tell me. You don't know.

46:56.160 --> 46:57.750
Who is this guy?

46:59.020 --> 47:00.360
Uh-oh.

47:00.430 --> 47:02.190
Excuse me, everyone.

47:02.260 --> 47:05.530
Sorry to disturb your lunch.
It's an emergency.

47:05.600 --> 47:09.800
Has anyone here ever seen a performance
at the Cedar Lake Ballet Company?

47:10.770 --> 47:12.630
The Cedar Lake
Ballet Company?

47:12.710 --> 47:13.690
Yeah, I have.

47:13.810 --> 47:14.930
Where is it?

47:15.010 --> 47:16.600
Son of a bitch.

47:25.820 --> 47:27.880
Hey, taxi. Hey!

47:32.790 --> 47:34.380
Taxi! Hey!

47:41.270 --> 47:42.670
Taxi!

47:44.840 --> 47:46.670
Maybe you should
try the subway.

47:46.740 --> 47:49.640
Don't all these taxies you're
diverting have plans, too?

47:49.710 --> 47:53.370
How long you going to keep that
up? Twenty minutes? An hour?

47:53.450 --> 47:56.180
Wow, the ripples must
just be endless.

47:56.250 --> 47:59.240
I don't care what you put
in my way, I'm not giving up.

48:03.720 --> 48:05.710
Hey! Hey! Hey!

48:09.430 --> 48:10.590
Taxi!

48:10.660 --> 48:12.060
Hey!

48:18.540 --> 48:19.900
You all right?

48:23.110 --> 48:24.130
You okay?

48:24.210 --> 48:25.340
What happened?

48:25.410 --> 48:27.440
You got hit.
Are you okay?

48:27.510 --> 48:28.910
I think so.
Don't move.

48:32.420 --> 48:33.940
You all right?

48:35.490 --> 48:38.120
Hello, I just
witnessed an accident

48:38.190 --> 48:40.520
on the corner of
Water and Dover Street.

48:40.590 --> 48:42.690
Unfortunately, you're the
only witness, Congressman.

48:42.760 --> 48:43.960
But we did this
three times already.

48:44.030 --> 48:45.500
I just need
a few more details.

48:46.570 --> 48:47.790
Oh, I see.

48:47.870 --> 48:49.860
You're not even a cop, are
you? You're one of them.

48:49.940 --> 48:51.770
Calm down.
Okay.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.270
Someone could
have been killed.

48:53.340 --> 48:54.830
Sir, if you would
just calm down.

48:54.910 --> 48:56.240
Hey, Sergeant.

48:56.410 --> 48:58.810
Hi. Sorry, excuse me, I know
you need a statement from me,

48:58.910 --> 49:00.810
but do I need to stay here
or can I do it over the phone?

49:00.880 --> 49:02.680
No, sir, we know how
to get in touch with you.

49:02.750 --> 49:05.550
Okay. Now, is this man
under your command?

49:07.350 --> 49:08.380
Never mind. Thank you.

49:19.500 --> 49:21.020
Hey, hey, hey!

49:22.600 --> 49:23.970
You want to make
a quick 100 bucks?

49:24.040 --> 49:26.560
You're going to have to break
a couple of traffic laws.

49:26.640 --> 49:30.080
All right, 26th and 10th. It's a
ballet company called Cedar Lake.

49:35.310 --> 49:36.580
Go through that.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.340
Look out!

49:38.420 --> 49:39.780
Watch it.

49:40.820 --> 49:43.380
This is going to keep
happening, just go through.

49:47.060 --> 49:48.190
Son of a bitch!

49:49.900 --> 49:51.990
Set a traffic jam on
Broadway. Too many ripples.

49:52.060 --> 49:53.330
He's getting out of range.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.890
I don't know what to do with
this. You're reaching your limit.

49:57.370 --> 49:58.430
Hey!

49:59.470 --> 50:00.670
Excuse me.

50:05.510 --> 50:07.840
Two down. Two down.

50:09.320 --> 50:11.040
Oh, shit!

50:11.120 --> 50:12.480
Next one.

50:12.550 --> 50:14.310
I hate downtown.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.000
Sorry.

50:27.730 --> 50:29.390
I've got
inflection points.

50:29.470 --> 50:32.270
All he needs to do is see her dance
and you're at your ripple limit.

50:32.340 --> 50:34.430
What? All right,
block the door.

50:34.510 --> 50:35.630
He's already
through it.

50:35.710 --> 50:36.940
Not that one,
the next one.

50:37.010 --> 50:38.170
Excuse me.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.010
David Norris,
I'm here to see Elise.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.880
I'm blocking them all.

50:43.350 --> 50:44.710
Hat! Hat!

50:44.780 --> 50:46.910
Is she here?
Yeah, she's in the studio.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.490
McCRADY: It's too late.
He's already seen her.

50:55.830 --> 50:57.760
You hit your ripple limit.

50:58.660 --> 51:00.130
Celebrate now.

51:00.670 --> 51:02.460
They're just going
to kick it upstairs.

51:02.530 --> 51:04.000
It's Donaldson.

51:09.780 --> 51:12.010
He has no idea
what he's up against.

51:57.160 --> 51:59.180
Let's take a walk.

52:05.060 --> 52:07.790
The intense chemistry
between them,

52:07.870 --> 52:09.770
the constant
inflection points,

52:09.840 --> 52:12.360
and the kicker, you
pulling them apart twice

52:12.440 --> 52:15.070
only to have chance
put them back together.

52:15.940 --> 52:17.770
Yeah, all that
seemed a little much.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.570
So, I asked Burdensky to do
some research this morning.

52:21.650 --> 52:24.670
Have you been
in here before?

52:24.820 --> 52:26.410
No, of course not.

52:26.490 --> 52:28.650
It seems like David
Norris and Elise Sellas

52:28.720 --> 52:29.740
were meant to be together

52:29.820 --> 52:32.660
because they were
meant to be together.

52:33.530 --> 52:34.860
Wait, what?

52:34.990 --> 52:36.290
In the '70s
when he was born,

52:36.360 --> 52:37.730
they were meant
to be together,

52:37.800 --> 52:40.160
same thing
in the '80s, '90s.

52:40.230 --> 52:42.790
Wasn't till 2005
that the plan changed

52:42.870 --> 52:46.000
and she was supposed
to stay with Adrian.

52:51.980 --> 52:55.110
<i>The problem here is there are
remnants from all those old plans</i>

52:55.180 --> 52:57.650
<i>that keep pushing
them together.</i>

52:57.720 --> 53:00.910
<i>They still feel like they belong with
each other even though they don't,</i>

53:01.020 --> 53:03.720
<i>and we're about to tear
them apart again.</i>

53:17.740 --> 53:20.030
You spend
your whole career

53:20.110 --> 53:23.270
hoping, someday,
you'll get a red-letter case.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.340
Something you can really
make a name for yourself with.

53:27.610 --> 53:29.380
Finally you get one,

53:29.780 --> 53:31.250
and it's booby-trapped.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.010
What?

53:33.090 --> 53:35.820
I'm saying,
it wasn't your fault.

53:36.990 --> 53:38.550
They were meant
to be together.

53:39.020 --> 53:40.080
What?

53:40.160 --> 53:42.680
Were. In an earlier
version of the plan.

53:42.760 --> 53:45.030
Actually, a dozen
earlier versions.

53:46.830 --> 53:49.490
I always wondered
how we had such bad luck

53:49.570 --> 53:54.160
that she was on that particular
bus on that particular day.

53:54.640 --> 53:56.800
How could a plan
just change like that?

53:56.940 --> 53:58.880
I don't know.

53:58.940 --> 54:01.640
It's above my pay grade.

54:02.010 --> 54:03.540
So, we're going
operational.

54:03.620 --> 54:05.110
This is exciting.
It's been a while.

54:05.250 --> 54:08.580
We're not
going operational.

54:09.760 --> 54:13.190
No one ever made it to my
job by taking stupid risks.

54:13.690 --> 54:15.020
So, what are
we going to do?

54:15.090 --> 54:16.920
We're going to kick
this case upstairs

54:17.000 --> 54:20.020
to someone with the latitude
to clean up this mess

54:20.100 --> 54:21.690
without breaking
into a sweat.

54:21.770 --> 54:23.860
We're going to bring
this to Thompson.

54:23.940 --> 54:25.160
Thompson?

54:25.900 --> 54:28.000
When he was in the field,
his nickname was...

54:28.070 --> 54:29.700
"The Hammer," yes.

54:29.780 --> 54:33.040
He'll crush this little
romance with a flick of his hand

54:33.180 --> 54:34.770
<i>and force them
back on plan again.</i>

54:34.850 --> 54:36.810
I want to go to a club.

54:36.950 --> 54:39.010
Oh! Why ruin
a really nice day?

54:39.080 --> 54:40.810
Come on.
No, I don't dance.

54:40.890 --> 54:43.860
Everyone can dance.
You just feel the music.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.620
Well, I've been told that
I have trouble feeling.

54:46.690 --> 54:48.160
Who told you that?

54:48.230 --> 54:50.160
A long list of women.

54:50.230 --> 54:51.420
That's gross.

54:51.500 --> 54:52.720
You know what?

54:52.970 --> 54:55.300
Let's race to
that lamppost.

54:55.370 --> 54:57.800
You win,
I dance for you.

54:58.270 --> 55:01.330
I win,
you dance for me.

55:01.410 --> 55:02.960
On the pole?

55:03.040 --> 55:04.340
If you like, yeah.

55:04.410 --> 55:06.170
This is serious.
What are the rules?

55:06.240 --> 55:07.610
There are no rules.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.910
Oh! You bastard!
Oh, my gosh!

55:12.780 --> 55:14.380
You challenged me
in those shoes?

55:14.450 --> 55:15.980
Okay, fine. I can't.

55:16.050 --> 55:18.650
You're right. These are the wrong
shoes. I'm going to twist an ankle.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.750
You said, "No rules. ' '
I avoided them.

55:20.890 --> 55:21.980
Ow!

55:24.060 --> 55:26.220
You said you
had trouble feeling.

55:27.870 --> 55:29.060
Great.

55:35.670 --> 55:36.770
Hey, David.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.280
You're even
cuter in person.

55:38.340 --> 55:39.870
Hey,
it's David Norris.

55:39.980 --> 55:42.780
How you doing?
How are you?

55:42.850 --> 55:44.510
How are we
feeling about this tie?

55:44.620 --> 55:45.740
Hey, David Norris!

55:45.820 --> 55:47.150
Hey, how you doing?

55:47.220 --> 55:48.780
Maybe I should go home
and get my tux.

55:48.850 --> 55:51.320
Definitely don't
do that. It's good.

55:51.390 --> 55:54.790
I should never have come back here
again without my backup dancers.

55:58.860 --> 55:59.960
I voted for you.

56:00.030 --> 56:01.190
How are you?

56:10.740 --> 56:13.610
Norris,
you're a rock star!

56:19.850 --> 56:21.610
Did you grow up over here?

56:21.690 --> 56:25.320
Yeah, three blocks over
that way. Pioneer Street.

56:25.390 --> 56:26.580
My whole childhood.

56:26.660 --> 56:28.720
What were you
like as a kid?

56:29.390 --> 56:32.160
I've spent about half my
time in the principal's office

56:32.230 --> 56:33.390
up until the sixth grade.

56:33.470 --> 56:34.450
Wow.

56:34.530 --> 56:37.500
Yeah, that was when my
mother and my brother died

56:37.640 --> 56:39.040
within a month
of each other.

56:39.100 --> 56:40.090
I'm sorry.

56:40.170 --> 56:42.000
No, it's fine.

56:42.340 --> 56:43.330
You know how I always
tell that story

56:43.410 --> 56:46.040
about how I got inspired
to go into politics

56:46.110 --> 56:48.240
because my dad took me
to the Senate Gallery

56:48.310 --> 56:50.870
and we sat together
and that's true.

56:51.350 --> 56:53.280
But what I leave out is

56:53.350 --> 56:55.380
he did that right
after they died.

56:55.690 --> 56:58.620
And I was bottoming out.

56:59.990 --> 57:02.650
So, he wanted to get me out
of here for a little while

57:02.730 --> 57:05.530
and he planned
this road trip to DC,

57:05.600 --> 57:07.720
and I think it's because
JFK was his idol.

57:09.100 --> 57:11.000
And we went and
sat in the gallery.

57:11.070 --> 57:15.370
I remember watching
him watch them,

57:15.440 --> 57:18.410
and I knew that that's
what I wanted to do.

57:20.350 --> 57:22.870
I wish they were here
to see all this.

57:26.550 --> 57:28.020
I was...

57:31.990 --> 57:34.620
Didn't expect
to tell you any of that.

58:49.670 --> 58:51.300
David?

58:52.900 --> 58:54.430
David?

59:01.150 --> 59:03.380
<i>Hello?
It's Adrian.</i>

59:04.750 --> 59:06.740
Hey.

59:07.950 --> 59:10.320
What are you doing?
Why are you calling?

59:11.190 --> 59:12.680
Hi.

59:13.460 --> 59:15.020
No, I was...

59:15.930 --> 59:17.490
Because I was sleeping.

59:19.460 --> 59:20.950
No.

59:21.030 --> 59:22.590
No, it's not.

59:22.670 --> 59:24.660
Why are you calling?

59:27.540 --> 59:29.630
Okay, well,
I got to go.

59:29.710 --> 59:32.700
No, I got to go. Okay.

59:35.650 --> 59:36.810
I'm so sorry.

59:36.880 --> 59:38.010
It's all right.
Everything okay?

59:38.080 --> 59:39.240
Yeah.

59:40.190 --> 59:42.020
Oh, my God. That was so weird.

59:42.090 --> 59:44.720
I woke up and
you weren't here.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.820
And then the phone rang
and it was my ex

59:47.890 --> 59:50.360
which is just so strange.

59:50.630 --> 59:52.530
Sorry, I guess we hadn't
gotten to any of that stuff yet.

59:52.600 --> 59:53.660
Right.

59:53.730 --> 59:56.360
You know, we broke up a while ago,

59:56.470 --> 59:59.900
and it's over and then he
calls four times in one morning.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.610
He called you four
times this morning?

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.800
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:09.900
How long have you guys
been broken up?

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.210
Um...

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.010
Three months.

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:16.150
It's like he knew
I was with someone else.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:21.150
Was it serious?

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:23.060
We were engaged.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.520
So, not really
that serious?

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.930
Right.

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.560
Well, what happened?

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.670
Do you want to know this?

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.860
Yeah.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.940
He was a great guy.

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:43.740
Brilliant choreographer
and dancer,

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.110
and we had the same
group of friends.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.280
We had known each
other a long time.

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:55.690
Well, he sounds great.
Why didn't you marry him?

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:03.120
Because of you.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.730
I'm not some
hopeless romantic.

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:10.070
I've never allowed myself
to be that way.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.510
But once I felt,

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.310
even for a moment,
what I felt with you.

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:23.610
You ruined me. I didn't
want to settle for less.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.590
I know the feeling.

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.180
It scares the
shit out of me.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:31.290
I'm not going
to hurt you.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.260
You don't need to say that.

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:36.390
I'm not going
to hurt you.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.800
This is the first time

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.930
in 25 years that I don't
feel like I'm by myself.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:49.210
That's a lot of
responsibility for me.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.220
I don't know if I'm quite
comfortable with that.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.310
Well, too late.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.190
You know, I'm supposed to go
to an interview right now.

01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:10.700
What if I told you I wasn't ready
to let you out of my sight quite yet?

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.970
Sounds good.
You want to go?

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.970
Yeah.
All right.

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:17.870
<i>Are you handsome</i>

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.640
<i>or is it that Washington
is so populated by</i>

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.280
<i>I don't want to say,
hideous abnormalities...</i>

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.950
This is getting
a little weird.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.520
David Norris,
everybody.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.790
Excuse me, ma'am.
Yes?

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.920
Congressman Norris asked me
to give you a message.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.160
He was just called
into a meeting.

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:43.560
He says it's urgent.
Okay.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.230
He said he'll call you
as soon as he's out

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.630
and he'll see you
at the show tonight.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.800
Okay, thank you.
Thanks.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.750
This way, Congressman.

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.130
Hello?

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:22.930
Frustrating, isn't it?

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.040
My name is Thompson.

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:30.210
Whatever happened
to free will?

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.980
We actually tried
free will before.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:35.610
After taking you from
hunting and gathering

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.180
to the height
of the Roman Empire,

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:41.950
we stepped back to see how
you would do on your own.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.260
You gave us the Dark Ages
for five centuries

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:50.060
until finally we decided
we should come back in.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.900
The Chairman thought that maybe
we just needed to do a better job

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:55.940
with teaching you
how to ride a bike

01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:58.040
before taking the
training wheels off again.

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.110
So, we gave you
the Renaissance,

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.650
the Enlightenment,
scientific revolution.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.370
For 600 years
we taught you

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.710
to control your
impulses with reason.

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:12.390
Then in 1910,
we stepped back again.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:17.160
Within 50 years, you had
brought us World War I,

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.200
the Depression,
Fascism, the Holocaust,

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:23.530
and capped it off by
bringing the entire planet

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.970
to the brink of destruction

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.830
in the Cuban missile crisis.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:29.700
At that point a decision was
taken to step back in again

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:33.870
before you did something
that even we couldn't fix.

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.040
You don't have
free will, David.

01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:41.550
You have the appearance
of free will.

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:44.050
You expect me
to believe that?

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.350
I make decisions
every day.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.790
You have free will over
which toothpaste you use

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.790
or which beverage
to order at lunch.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.060
But humanity just
isn't mature enough

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:54.990
to control the
important things.

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.330
So, you handle
the important things?

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.770
The last time I checked, the
world is a pretty screwed-up place.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.200
It's still here.

01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:04.870
If we had left things in
your hands, it wouldn't be.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.770
Tell me why
I can't be with Elise?

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:09.380
Because the last
guy didn't know.

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:13.140
Meeting Elise at the Waldorf
three years ago wasn't chance.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.650
That was us.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.620
We knew she would inspire
you to give that speech.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.950
That speech that brought you
back from the edge of oblivion

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:24.860
and overnight made you the
frontrunner in this coming election.

01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:26.920
What are you saying? You
want me to win the election?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.260
This one and
four more after it.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.490
And I'm not just talking
about elections for Senate.

01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:38.580
You can matter, David.
Really matter.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.040
What your father wanted when he
took you to the Senate Gallery

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:44.050
when you were 10.

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:46.240
What your brother wanted
when he made you promise

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.080
the day before he overdosed

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:50.210
that you wouldn't
be like him.

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:54.950
Why do you think you have that
yearning to be in front of people?

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.560
That terrible emptiness
when you're not.

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:01.060
Don't do that.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:03.660
David, you can
change the world,

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:07.070
but that doesn't happen
if you stay with her.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.370
Why do you people
care who I love?

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.410
It's not about her,
it's about you.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.210
What being with her
does to you.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.710
What it does to me?

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.980
I'm better when
I'm with her!

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:19.780
Even you said it.
The speech.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.010
In small doses,
Elise was the cure.

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:24.750
But in large doses,

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.150
she rubs off on you.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:27.210
Stop.

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:31.250
David, the president
can't be a loose cannon.

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:32.760
Stop talking.
It's not working.

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:36.770
Why do you refuse to accept what
should be completely obvious by now?

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:39.060
You've seen
what we can do.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.900
You can't doubt we are
who we say we are.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.810
Look, it's not about who
you are, it's about who I am.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.750
Can't outrun
your fate, David.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:56.220
I just disagree with you
about what my fate is.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.150
I know what I feel for her
and it's not going to change.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.090
All I have are
the choices that I make.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.300
And I choose her

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.920
come what may.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.070
It's 6:20.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.630
If you leave now,
you can make Elise's show.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:35.069
She's a beautiful dancer.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.609
I thought I made
myself clear.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.020
There is one more piece to
this I haven't mentioned.

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:46.260
I guess I just didn't
have the heart.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.000
If you stay with her,

01:08:52.069 --> 01:08:55.100
it not only kills your
dreams, it kills hers.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:58.609
What?

01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:03.310
Elise is about to become one of the
most famous dancers in the country

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.109
and eventually one of the
world's greatest choreographers.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.090
If she stays with you,

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:12.149
she ends up teaching
dance to six-year-olds.

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.930
When you look back
at all this, David,

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:31.800
just remember

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.580
we tried
to reason with you.

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:49.420
I always hear
people saying,

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:54.520
"You can't blame yourself for
what happens to other people,"

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:57.960
but in this case,
really, you can.

01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:08.670
This is what
you do, David.

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:11.210
This is what you did
getting into a bar fight

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.140
the night you
first got elected.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.700
<i>What you did to get that embarrassing
photo in The New York Post.</i>

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:20.880
We give you opportunities
other people would kill for

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:23.610
and you squander
them with impulse.

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:27.220
It doesn't take
a genius to see Elise

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:30.850
isn't exactly
helping you with this.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.360
<i>It's a sprain, David,</i>

01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:35.920
<i>but if you stay with her,</i>

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.630
you'll take away the only
thing she ever cared about.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.930
It's up to you.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.430
It's just a sprain.

01:12:02.465 --> 01:12:02.950
Yeah.

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:05.960
The doctor said it's going to
be better in a month or less.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.660
That's totally unexpected.

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.560
I'm so relieved.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.500
Great. Great.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.930
You're such
a great dancer,

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:21.240
and you'll heal up and
just get better and better.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.250
I'm going to go make
a couple phone calls.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.520
Okay.

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:39.250
Okay.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.730
I'm so happy for you.

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:17.530
It's done.
Thompson finished it.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.430
I know.

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:23.840
You can't let it
get to you

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:26.340
like it did
with his family.

01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:28.850
This is the job.

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.520
<i>You ever wonder</i>

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.460
<i>if it's right?</i>

01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:44.720
I mean,

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.490
if it's always right?

01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:51.560
<i>Not like I used to.</i>

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:54.830
Look, Chairman has the plan.

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:56.670
We only see part of it.

01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:25.170
<i>I was talking to some friends of ours
over in Monroe County this morning,</i>

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.300
<i>and I said something
to them that I think</i>

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:30.400
<i>a lot of you may have heard me
say before but it bears repeating.</i>

01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:34.480
<i>David Norris, who has spent the last two
days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes area</i>

01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:38.140
<i>received some welcome news yesterday
when the latest New York Times poll</i>

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.620
<i>gave him a 16-point
lead over his opponent</i>

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.950
<i>less than a month
before election day.</i>

01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:45.450
<i>Since his announcement
11 months ago,</i>

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.750
<i>Norris has had
a significant lead...</i>

01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:50.390
Hi. Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:52.500
Yeah, thank you.
I need it. Thank you.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.760
Who should I make it out to?
My nephew, Miles.

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:56.270
There you go.
Thank you so much.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.300
Thank you.
My pleasure. Pleasure.

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:02.860
Can we get
a picture with you?

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.430
Sure, come on.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.640
Thank you.
Thanks.

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.740
Hey.

01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:14.810
I want to show you this, because
you would find out eventually.

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:16.650
I want to be here
when you do.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.520
She's getting married to
that guy she was engaged to.

01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:28.930
You okay?

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.320
I think I'm going to...

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:33.140
Take a day off.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.800
Hell, take a couple.
We're 16 points up.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.640
Yeah, even I can't
blow a lead that big.

01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:49.840
Congressman,
good to see you again.

01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:51.980
Your friend
just left you this.

01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:53.570
He said you would
be stopping by.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.900
Why would you
want to see me?

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:21.440
Thompson was
lying when he said

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:24.310
you couldn't be with Elise because
she brings out your reckless side.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.750
Then why? Why do
they care so much?

01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:31.050
Because she's enough, David.

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:32.950
If you have her,

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.120
you won't need to fill
that void inside of you

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.750
with applause and votes

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:40.230
and dreams of one day
making it to the White House.

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:44.160
That's important, but it's not
the only thing that matters.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.700
Why are you so
different from them?

01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:58.740
Your dad

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.450
was a very smart man.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.850
He could have been a
lot more. Wanted to be.

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:11.390
Your brother, too.

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:14.130
But the plan
didn't call for it.

01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:16.720
What about my mother?

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.170
That wasn't me.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.600
That wasn't us at all.

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:22.770
It was just chance?

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.870
I'm sorry.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.080
You know,
Thompson is not lying.

01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:38.510
They're already talking about me
being a presidential candidate.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.720
I'm phoning in my speeches
and I'm 16 points up.

01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:43.660
The public loves you.

01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:46.790
Before I met Elise,
that's all I cared about.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:50.860
I don't even notice it now.

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:58.670
I can't stop
thinking about her.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.080
Do you know where
she's getting married?

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.190
In front of a judge
tomorrow morning.

01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:15.350
Is she happy?

01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:20.750
Thompson won't let you
anywhere near her.

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:23.320
Not tonight,
not tomorrow, not ever.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.100
Harry.

01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:27.230
Is she happy?

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.900
I got to try
and get her back.

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:37.240
Will you help me? Will you
just help me get to her?

01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:39.480
They'll sense you
coming a mile away.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.440
What if I could move
as fast as you?

01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:46.180
Teach me about the doors.

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:49.680
The rain will stop
in the next hour,

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.520
and that's the only thing keeping
them from seeing us right now.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.290
If we're going to do this,
we'll need all night to do it

01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:58.100
and a place surrounded
by water to do it in.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.860
Always turn the
doorknob clockwise.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.200
What happens if I turn it the other way?

01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:07.040
You don't want to do that.
That's only for us.

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:09.980
Put your hand
on my shoulder

01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:12.380
and don't let go until
we cross the threshold.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.010
Are these ever locked?

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.680
Not when you're wearing one of our hats.

01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:22.150
Keep moving, David.

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:29.560
Is this...

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.300
It's the Museum
of Modern Art.

01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:32.530
Yeah.

01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:45.140
Close the door.

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:55.380
This is the city's main pumping
station for downtown Manhattan.

01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:58.450
We're 10 blocks
from the courthouse.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.230
Wait here.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:27.050
Hi, is the floor open?

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.220
You okay, sweetie?

01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:30.280
Yeah, I just...

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.490
I just feel like
being on the floor.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.570
Lower Manhattan is layer
upon layer of substrate.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.580
That's what we call the doors
that have been added over time.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:52.050
Makes it a lot more complex to
navigate downtown than it is uptown

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.510
and a lot slower.

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:58.610
Your destination, 60 Centre
Street, Courtroom 300.

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:04.990
There are thousands
of different ways

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.330
<i>to get to the courthouse
using the doors.</i>

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.760
I want you to learn how
to stay in the substrate

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:12.320
so Thompson won't be able
to get a fix on you.

01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:15.500
<i>Okay. Just south of
the diner, it's a red door.</i>

01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:18.040
I come out on Broadway,
right by Leonard Street.

01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:19.940
That's good.
Keep going.

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.410
From Leonard,
half a block down.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.110
Okay, suppose
Thompson's there?

01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.580
Okay, I go east
to Lafayette.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.410
No, it's Crosby
Street there.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.490
Eight doors? I'm zigzagging
all over the place.

01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:31.680
That will take me
too long.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.150
But every time you
go through a door,

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.950
their plan books will lose
track of you, so it's safer.

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:39.450
<i>Look, I need you to understand
this has never been done before.</i>

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:43.000
So, the minute you go through that
first door, all hell will break loose.

01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:45.930
<i>Assume everyone with
a hat on is a threat.</i>

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.400
I don't care if
it's a Yankee cap,

01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:49.270
a bowler, or
even a yarmulke.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.140
Assume everyone in a hat
is working with Thompson.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.970
Even you guys can't get through the
doors without your hats on, right?

01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:56.170
Right.

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:58.650
<i>It's one of the ways the
Chairman limits our power.</i>

01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.910
<i>Water is another way.</i>

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.470
And you said before, what if Thompson's
in front of me on Crosby Street?

01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:03.610
Right.

01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:05.590
Why don't I just knock
the hat off his head

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:08.020
and then run by him before
he has time to pick it up?

01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:10.530
That's good, improvisation.
We have trouble with that.

01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:13.620
The fastest way is actually if
I go right for the blue door.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.700
<i>Yeah, but then you're
exposed the entire way there.</i>

01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:17.960
That's a lot more dangerous
than leapfrogging through doors.

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.060
But if I make it, I'll take
them completely by surprise.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.160
If you make it.

01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:29.170
<i>Come on, we have
a lot more to get through.</i>

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:31.150
Whatever it takes.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.410
Your father used
to say that.

01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:46.390
I guess you're not supposed
to identify with your subjects.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:47.990
You're not supposed
to feel guilt.

01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:51.860
We're not built to lead with
our emotions like you are,

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.390
but that doesn't mean
we don't have them.

01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.610
Some more than others.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.690
You're lucky,
it started raining again.

01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:25.740
We need to get going.
The wedding is in 10 minutes.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.070
We have time. Being early
is just as bad as being late.

01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:33.670
Is your fiancÃ©e here?

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.440
She's on her way in.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:38.510
Courtroom 300.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.510
You okay?
Yeah.

01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:51.020
This is it.
Okay.

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.120
I'm going to go
for the blue door.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.360
Of course.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.300
Here is your way through
it. Don't lose it.

01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:04.600
Thanks, Harry.

01:25:04.670 --> 01:25:06.370
Good luck.

01:25:11.850 --> 01:25:13.480
Okay.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.600
It looks like Mr. Norris is using
the rain to make a run for it.

01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:37.040
Call the proctor
at the wedding.

01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:41.580
What's wrong? Nothing.
I'm just nervous, I guess.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.610
I just need a minute
in the bathroom, okay?

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.370
Sir, he's got a hat.
He's in the substrate.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.170
He just went into
the substrate.

01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:29.560
Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.

01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:31.560
It's an emergency. Sorry.

01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:34.430
Docket number 22,
please come forward.

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:35.970
We're next. Will you go check on her?

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:37.360
Yeah.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.930
You're David Norris!
Yeah, I got to go.

01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:51.340
Nothing in the hat.

01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:52.510
Go ahead.

01:27:08.230 --> 01:27:09.860
She's not even
in there.

01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:13.500
Where is she?
Where is she?

01:27:15.370 --> 01:27:16.930
Elise.

01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:20.430
You're not
marrying that guy.

01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:24.340
I'm so sorry,

01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:27.610
and I don't know what you must
think of me, but you can't marry him.

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.910
You don't love him.
I've been terrible, I know.

01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:31.980
I'm getting married.
No, you can't.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.320
Don't touch me!
What are you doing?

01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:37.020
Do you know that no one has
ever hurt me as much as you did?

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:38.820
I'm so sorry that I left
you the way that I did.

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.560
David, you know what? You
left me in a fucking hospital.

01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:42.720
What are you doing?

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.890
I know it seems terrible
but there was a reason.

01:27:44.970 --> 01:27:46.600
You don't know
anything about me

01:27:46.670 --> 01:27:47.860
and what makes me happy.

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.700
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.900
Oh, my God.

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.880
Don't worry about him,
he's with them.

01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:56.810
Just listen to me.
Oh, my God, what did you do?

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.740
Forget about him.
What are you doing?

01:27:59.450 --> 01:28:02.820
Look at me, I know
that you love me.

01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:09.820
Okay, this says
that you love me

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.430
and that I love you and that
we're not supposed to be together.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:13.660
Because of this book.

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:15.460
But I know that I'm
supposed to be with you

01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:16.730
because of the way I feel.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.600
I love you and I don't
care what happens.

01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:21.690
I want to spend the rest of my life with
you even if it's only a little while.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.310
He just revealed us.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.000
Call the Intervention Team.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.510
<i>Tell them it's
a square-one reset.</i>

01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:38.520
Mr. Thompson has deployed
the Intervention Team.

01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:40.890
He's requesting an emergency
Reset Authorization.

01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:42.420
I'll carry it in.

01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:52.430
Why are they chasing you?

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.570
They're going to reset me.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.130
What are you
talking about?

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:00.770
I never lied to you.

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.370
Down here.

01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:04.870
He's down here.

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.850
I love you, Elise.

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:10.720
I'm going to show
you something.

01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:12.850
You deserve to know.

01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:14.680
What's going on?

01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:26.630
We got to keep moving.
There is another door here.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.830
Got them.
Sixth Avenue.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.660
Contain this.

01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:05.070
Oh, my God.
What's happening to me?

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.300
All you need to know,
we're being chased.

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:10.700
I need you to trust me.

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:12.910
Okay.
Okay, come on.

01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:25.690
Door, door, door!

01:30:28.730 --> 01:30:29.720
Find another door!

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.140
What the hell is going on?

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.900
What the hell is
going on, David?

01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:39.030
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:40.340
How did we
just do that?

01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:41.880
I'm so sorry.

01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:44.350
These doors belong to the
people who are chasing us.

01:30:44.410 --> 01:30:46.440
Who are they? I don't
know what to call them,

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.110
but they want to take
you away from me.

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.910
Why do they
care about us?

01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:51.540
They hurt your ankle,
Elise.

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:53.420
Everything you've worked
for your entire life,

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:55.360
it doesn't happen
if you stay with me.

01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:57.050
That's why I left you
in the hospital.

01:30:57.130 --> 01:30:58.620
I don't understand.

01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:01.760
I don't understand.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.200
This can't be wrong.

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:08.200
This can't be wrong.

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.110
Why do they
think it's wrong?

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.510
The book... Their book.

01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:17.080
But what if I can
find who wrote it?

01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:27.150
Okay, I can go
through this door alone.

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.660
You'll never see me or the
people chasing us again.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.620
Or you could come with me, and I
don't know what's on the other side,

01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:38.660
but I know you
would be next to me,

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.700
and that's all I've wanted
since the minute I met you.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.210
I'm coming with you.

01:31:58.190 --> 01:31:59.710
Okay.

01:32:02.630 --> 01:32:03.650
Take the other one.

01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:06.190
Turn it to the left.

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:07.750
To the left.

01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:18.170
Oh, my God.

01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:39.560
Hey!
You can't be in here.

01:32:39.630 --> 01:32:41.100
Stop, sir!

01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:43.100
Hold them up!

01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:46.360
Come on.

01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.070
Stop them!

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:18.260
Harry Mitchell, they want
you in the Chairman's office.

01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:19.860
Immediately.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.180
Come on.

01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:55.860
Hey! Hey!

01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.070
How did you get in here?

01:34:16.330 --> 01:34:17.380
Search the room!

01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.170
Shit!

01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:38.370
Go back.

01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:04.670
No.

01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:06.970
Oh, my God.

01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:15.770
I love you.
I love you.

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.160
Did you really think you
could reach the Chairman?

01:36:04.930 --> 01:36:06.700
And change your
fate if you did?

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.930
Or write your own?

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.210
It doesn't work like that
and I told you why.

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:17.470
I've got a message for you.

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.390
I understand.

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.290
Even Thompson has a boss.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:42.060
Harry?

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.070
You're the Chairman?

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.540
No.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.800
You've met him
though, or her.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.370
Everybody has.

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.680
The Chairman comes in a
different form to everyone

01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:58.280
so people rarely realize
when it happens.

01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:04.760
Is this some
sort of test?

01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:06.990
In a way, it's all a test,

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.300
for everybody, even the members
of the Adjustment Bureau.

01:37:12.670 --> 01:37:15.300
David, you risked
everything for Elise.

01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:18.810
And Elise, when you came through
that door at the Statue of Liberty,

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.400
you risked everything, too.

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.930
But you inspired me.

01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:25.840
It seems like you
inspired the Chairman, too.

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:30.450
Is that about us?

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.950
Yes.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.950
What does it say?

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:37.250
It says that this situation
between the two of you

01:37:37.330 --> 01:37:39.920
is a serious deviation
from the plan.

01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:45.490
So, the Chairman
rewrote it.

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:54.840
Okay.

01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:57.710
Now what?

01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:59.110
Now...

01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.410
You can take the stairs.

01:38:18.230 --> 01:38:20.700
<i>Most people live life
on the path we set for them.</i>

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.500
<i>Too afraid
to explore any other.</i>

01:38:25.210 --> 01:38:27.770
<i>But once in a while,
people like you come along</i>
