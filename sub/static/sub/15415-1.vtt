WEBVTT

02:43.288 --> 02:44.414
Halt!

02:49.294 --> 02:51.092
Welcome, gentlemen.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.307
Jean Saval.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.165
Prison, Devil's Island.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.001
Ten years without possibility of parole

03:04.101 --> 03:07.671
for the theft of that famous painting,
The Winter, El Greco.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.115
Known as the master of disguise.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.510
Terence Scanlon.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.596
Dartmoor Prison, England.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.015
Member of the illegal
Irish Republican Army.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.685
Demolitions expert, serving
the 18th year of a 25-year sentence

03:21.785 --> 03:24.605
for revolutionary activities
against the Crown.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.608
It seems you don't like
the English, Scanlon.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.631
There's little to like.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.863
Well, now you're working for us,
you'll come to love us.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.465
Simon Fell.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.243
Imprisoned at Leavenworth,
United States of America.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.812
Ten to 20 years, two years served.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.390
Forgery.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.481
John Durrell.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.316
Alcatraz.

03:49.688 --> 03:54.885
Nationality unknown, origin unknown,
believed to be a paid assassin.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.330
Awaiting execution
for the slaying of his mistress.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.912
Roberto Rocca.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.226
El Ramle Prison, Lebanon.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.730
Organizer of international
criminal activities, 20 years.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.173
Degrees...

04:10.000 --> 04:13.153
Degrees in psychology,
classic Greek literature,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.176
structural engineering.

04:15.547 --> 04:20.243
Strange that a man would choose to throw
away his education planning crimes.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.687
I found it a challenging career.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.729
All right, dismissed. Wait for us outside.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.531
Find a seat. Sit down.

04:39.863 --> 04:44.376
Now, I want to make it quite clear that you
men were not my choice for this mission.

04:44.743 --> 04:49.106
However, Intelligence seems
to feel that your peculiar talents

04:49.206 --> 04:51.174
could be of some value.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.027
But don't for a moment imagine
that serving under me

04:54.127 --> 04:57.280
will be any easier than the prisons
you've come from.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.741
You've all been offered pardons
to undertake this mission.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.993
In one case, you've been offered life.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.579
Now, you've given your word to cooperate.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.289
I expect you to keep it.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.563
Just how much cooperation do you expect?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.441
Can you give us the facts?

05:14.314 --> 05:19.136
All I can tell you at the moment is that
we shall be going to occupied Europe.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.096
And what we do there
will be very dangerous

05:21.196 --> 05:24.325
but of the utmost importance
to the outcome of the war.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.476
Is that all we get to know?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.353
You'll only know what you need to know.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.707
We'll probably all be doing
something magnificent!

05:32.374 --> 05:34.217
You're probably going to commit suicide.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.847
Now, keep your heads down!
We're using live ammunition!

05:50.976 --> 05:52.319
Let him have some, too.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.183
Is this damn trip necessary?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.001
Is this damn trip necessary?

06:09.786 --> 06:11.959
Was that damn trip necessary?

06:12.998 --> 06:15.922
I didn't volunteer
for any suicide mission.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.973
I may take a walk out of here and not stop
until I reach neutral territory.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.202
It's a long walk.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.703
What's so hard about it?

06:26.803 --> 06:31.650
If I'm picked up, I'll forge some papers
of a limey soldier and play a straggler.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.795
You want to try, I'll go with you.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.272
You're on.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.029
Anybody else?

06:41.818 --> 06:44.387
The barbarians, they haven't
got a bit of Irish whiskey.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.722
I'll go with you, lad.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.324
What about you?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.060
I don't like lost causes.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.355
Lost causes! That's what the British told
the Irish the day of the Easter Rebellion.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.731
Hush! Come on!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.233
What about your word?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.630
Our word?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.510
Our word's no good!

07:19.189 --> 07:21.191
Don't wake him up, lads.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.596
Look at this dainty little thing.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.856
There he is, Sleeping Beauty.
Let me give him a shot...

07:28.865 --> 07:31.118
Scanlon! Give the kid a break.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.242
Saval, what are you doing?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.605
Studying his expression.
It's the key to the whole thing.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.901
Hey! Hey, look what I found in here, lads.
Another uniform and some stationery!

07:40.001 --> 07:41.201
- That's good.
- Anything else?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.679
Nothing else.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.282
Bring the stationery, Scanlon.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.993
Hold this, will you? There you go, me boy.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.411
Go to sleep!

07:49.511 --> 07:51.079
I need something
with this guy's signature on it.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.123
- See if you can open that drawer.
- See if I can open the drawer?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.457
Why, you've got the guts of Kelsey.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.586
With this little thing,
it's like having your own key.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.212
Here's his ID.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.174
Well, what's this? Christmas?
Well, what do you... Oh, Scotch.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.403
Well, I'll have to drink it
with me eyes closed.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.416
Here you are.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.486
I beg your pardon, sir.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.196
There's no destination
indicated on this release.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.115
How long have you been in this department?

08:27.215 --> 08:30.076
- Three years, sir.
- It seems you've forgotten a cardinal rule.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.453
"Only know what you need to know."

08:32.554 --> 08:35.273
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.627
We were just going down for a bite, sir.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.193
Pretty clumsy, and rather childish.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.236
Now, you've had your fun,
but if this happens in action,

09:05.336 --> 09:06.758
God help you!

09:12.135 --> 09:15.981
The invasion of Italy is scheduled
to start in a few days.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.543
But to ensure success, we've got to
have a second front in the Balkans

09:20.643 --> 09:22.087
to split the German defenses.

09:22.187 --> 09:26.675
You mean we're to be the second front?
We're to take on the entire Nazi army?

09:26.775 --> 09:28.009
I hope not.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.930
Now, the Partisans in the Balkans
are ready to strike,

09:32.030 --> 09:33.515
and we're going to work with them.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.810
And if we succeed,
we'll create such hell in the Balkans

09:36.910 --> 09:40.897
that we'll draw every panzer division
away between Trieste and Rome.

09:40.997 --> 09:45.218
Yes, but the Germans
still have the Italians with them.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.887
At the moment, yes.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.572
But there's one man

09:49.672 --> 09:54.428
who can swing the entire Italian
occupation forces over to the Partisans.

09:55.178 --> 09:58.373
Our job is to persuade him to do so.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.066
Who is this man?

10:01.518 --> 10:06.277
Well, we're not there yet,
but as of now, you're part of the invasion.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.276
Thousands of lives are in your hands.

10:10.318 --> 10:14.597
Maybe this is your chance to pay society
back for all the trouble you've caused it.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.074
Right?

10:39.097 --> 10:40.874
Damn bad luck about this fog.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.042
Maybe not.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.961
No German patrol boats would suspect
anybody out on a night like this.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.108
Yeah?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.734
Beautiful staterooms, huh?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.862
Listen, Rocca.

10:54.362 --> 10:58.475
That escape try in Cairo may have been
for laughs, but this time I'm not kidding.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.795
- Italy's just out there.
- More than 40 miles.

11:04.789 --> 11:08.193
Look, there's a dory tied
to the back of this tub.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.569
You speak the language.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.114
Now, all we've got to do is get lost
in the hills until the invasion rolls by,

11:13.214 --> 11:15.933
then we come down and join our buddies.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.995
There is nobody waiting for me in Italy.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.498
You don't have to stay there.
We'll take off.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.646
There is nobody anyplace.

11:24.642 --> 11:28.363
Besides, I find this adventure
very amusing, don't you?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.715
You are crazy Italian.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.738
Okay, I'll go it alone.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.338
Hey, wait a minute. Listen. Listen!

11:54.214 --> 11:55.532
There's something out there.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.179
Cut the engine!

13:15.253 --> 13:17.238
One of your men escaped.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.464
What?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.356
Take it easy, buster.

14:31.746 --> 14:35.626
I don't know what you're saying,
but whatever it is, the answer is no.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.716
Well, apparently, I miscalculated again.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.427
I never thought Fell would try it
once we were underway.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.678
Now, listen.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.680
When the German craft comes alongside,

15:05.780 --> 15:08.099
the skipper will try and stall
as long as possible,

15:08.199 --> 15:10.199
and we'll slip overboard
and take them from behind.

15:10.201 --> 15:14.001
Oh, no, no, no. Not me.
I didn't sign up for any street fighting.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.295
You're not on a street.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.743
Durrell!

17:40.768 --> 17:42.645
Scanlon, come with me.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.489
Come on, fellows, hurry it up!
Hurry it up!

18:09.589 --> 18:11.717
All right. Bring him up. Gently.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.481
He's dead.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.323
You...

18:47.793 --> 18:49.070
Now, come on,
let's launch this small boat.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.250
We've gotta sink this ship.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.865
No. We are safer right here.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.158
- Scanlon?
- Yeah?

18:54.258 --> 18:57.119
Can you place charges in such a way

18:57.219 --> 19:00.039
that the back of the boat
will blow up on cue?

19:00.139 --> 19:02.458
I can make it dance a jig right on time.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.607
As we approach the beach, we'll blow up.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.652
We'll leave in time and swim ashore.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.717
Well, I hate to admit it,
but it's a damn good plan.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.570
- All right, Scanlon, get cracking.
- Right!

19:38.969 --> 19:41.813
- There are the shore lights.
- You're right.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.927
- Petar?
- Up there!

20:37.027 --> 20:38.779
Right. Come on!

20:45.119 --> 20:47.622
My throat's too small for my heart.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.559
Petar!

21:12.646 --> 21:13.863
Petar!

21:15.858 --> 21:17.551
- Well, we finally made it, huh?
- Yes.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.638
I am Marko, liaison
to the Partisan Army in this district.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.766
- Food and rest after your long journey.
- Thank you.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.518
Yeah. Food for everybody else.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.729
You wouldn't by chance have
a little liquid around, would you?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.957
- Yes, I would.
- You have!

21:33.167 --> 21:34.669
Look at this!

21:35.878 --> 21:37.050
Good.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.724
It is right that we should enjoy
what moments we can.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.453
By nightfall, we shall be
in the German stronghold,

21:44.553 --> 21:46.288
the fortress city of Dubrovnik.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.415
Now, listen.

21:47.515 --> 21:51.335
In that fortress is the man
we've come here to liberate.

21:51.435 --> 21:55.631
General Quadri, commander,
Italian occupation forces.

21:55.731 --> 21:59.719
You mean to tell me we're risking our necks
to get some clown out of his own barracks?

21:59.819 --> 22:02.221
No, he's there as a prisoner of the Nazis.

22:02.321 --> 22:06.058
Now, they suspect that he's been
in touch with Allied agents,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.358
but he's too well loved by his men
to publicly denounce,

22:08.452 --> 22:11.105
so they use him as a puppet
to keep the Italians in line.

22:11.205 --> 22:14.233
They guard him day and night
to make sure he doesn't act on his own.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.428
How certain are you
that he will act on his own?

22:18.212 --> 22:20.948
Well, he's an Italian,
but he's not a Fascist.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.826
And only he commands
the absolute loyalty of his men.

22:23.926 --> 22:28.122
Now, if we can free him before the invasion,
he'll bring them all over to our side.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.395
When do we enter Dubrovnik?

22:31.016 --> 22:32.768
We start right now.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.628
We'll travel in pairs.

22:34.728 --> 22:38.132
- You speak our language?
- Well, enough to get by.

22:38.232 --> 22:41.532
- You two go together.
- No, I'll go in with Fell.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.305
Do you speak Serbian?

22:44.405 --> 22:46.140
What? Oh, I don't think so,

22:46.240 --> 22:49.494
but I'm getting along wonderful
with this one here.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.917
She'll take you in there.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.418
Mila?

23:42.963 --> 23:45.783
Back there, what did you say
to the girl Mila?

23:45.883 --> 23:49.411
I asked her if she would be afraid to be
with the one with the dead eyes.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.139
- Why?
- Well, she's seen so much death.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.293
Her husband was shot down before her
with a child kicking in her belly.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.796
She recognizes Durrell as an executioner.

23:58.896 --> 24:03.242
Yes. Never have I seen death
walking about, looking like a man.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.620
Dubrovnik.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.957
From here, it looks as it always has.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.207
Now we come to free it.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.544
And who will free it from us?

24:18.207 --> 24:19.959
And who will free us

24:20.668 --> 24:22.215
from ourselves?

24:28.509 --> 24:30.887
- Let's do the job.
- Yes.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.220
I speak English.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.572
Oh?

24:51.115 --> 24:54.540
It's a nice thing to do,
to try to help us.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.813
We're all just trying to help ourselves.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.790
And not each other?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.759
Does anyone know how?

25:27.609 --> 25:29.111
You like him?

25:31.238 --> 25:32.990
What does it matter?

27:02.996 --> 27:05.816
We should do a turn on the stage, lads.
We had all the guards laughing.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.152
Go into the kitchen, lass,
and get to the cooking.

27:08.252 --> 27:11.256
Marko, Rocca, come here.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.741
Rocca, this is
for your particular attention.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.951
Now, these maps show
the construction of the fortress

27:16.051 --> 27:17.995
with the changes made
after the Nazi occupation.

27:18.095 --> 27:22.771
Now, of the few possible means of entry,
Intelligence has chosen this one.

27:23.517 --> 27:24.793
This one?

27:24.893 --> 27:28.630
It's an underground river, once used
as a natural sewage system.

27:28.730 --> 27:32.780
It still runs under the city,
but it's no longer in use.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.345
I trust to British Intelligence,

27:35.445 --> 27:40.667
but in the final analysis,
I trust only to myself.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.038
We will see.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.798
How about some grapes?

28:47.809 --> 28:50.813
Their headquarters
are just behind the square.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.022
The river mouth
is below that guard of men.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.960
They've increased the guards
in the past two weeks.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.940
They know the invasion is imminent,
but not the place of it.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.905
Our task has been made
even more difficult.

29:55.585 --> 29:56.778
Recent?

29:56.878 --> 30:01.179
No, the Germans don't bother
anymore marking graves.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.460
Do many people come to visit here?

30:11.560 --> 30:13.921
Oh, I think not,
but it's easy to make certain.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.423
Yes, sir. And the caretaker?

30:16.523 --> 30:18.592
An old man who only speaks to the dead.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.569
But he won't betray us.

30:21.403 --> 30:24.139
Where is the nearest German garrison?

30:24.239 --> 30:27.664
Oh, about 300 meters from here,
behind these walls.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.167
We'll need the tools brought here.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.650
Have to be done all by hand.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.527
Can't risk explosives, unless...

30:37.627 --> 30:38.628
What?

30:38.879 --> 30:40.301
Well, we'll see.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.684
Let's get inside of this one.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.495
I beg your pardon.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.762
We begin digging here.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.309
Good.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.087
How much longer for my shift?

31:37.187 --> 31:38.463
Fifteen minutes.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.942
If the boys at Monte-Carlo
could only see me now.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.804
Do you realize I'm risking a great career?

31:45.904 --> 31:48.140
A broken finger,
an infected nail, and bang!

31:48.240 --> 31:49.558
A couple of more weeks of this, lad,

31:49.658 --> 31:52.502
and I'll be taking out a card
in the Mole Union.

32:19.646 --> 32:22.841
What's the matter down there, huh?
What is it?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.885
I just met one of the more recent burials.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.888
Recent burials?
What are you talking about?

32:27.988 --> 32:30.207
I'm not going back down there.

32:43.003 --> 32:47.474
Rocca, this tunneling is going too slowly.
We've only got three days left.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.951
We'll be inside in time.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.789
Well, the margin's too close.
This mission is not going to fail, hear me?

32:53.889 --> 32:56.291
- We'll tunnel around the clock.
- The curfew.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.628
If any of us are
discovered out after dark...

32:59.728 --> 33:03.528
- Yeah, well, I'll take that risk.
- You'll take it without me.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.074
You'll do what I tell you.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.617
I will work.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.244
And Svetlana.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.132
How much longer?

33:45.232 --> 33:46.633
No more.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.782
Yes, I will do my share.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.905
I said no more.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.673
How gentle you can sometimes be.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.254
Go home and nurse your child.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.860
Go on.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.727
I can reproduce this stuff in my sleep.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.124
Good boy.

35:22.996 --> 35:24.998
They've picked up Petar.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.859
- When?
- I saw them in the street,

35:27.959 --> 35:29.653
just after I left the cemetery.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.196
Can he be trusted?

35:31.296 --> 35:32.531
He can be trusted.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.617
But if he is tortured, who knows?

35:35.717 --> 35:38.954
We'll have to suspend the operation
until we're sure.

35:39.054 --> 35:43.358
And if Petar talks,
it will have to be abandoned.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.477
Abandoned?

35:46.478 --> 35:47.855
Abandoned?

35:48.521 --> 35:52.133
This mission will be abandoned
only when all six of us are dead!

35:52.233 --> 35:53.610
Like hell.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.346
I'm not dying to prove you've got guts.

35:56.446 --> 35:57.472
What's driving you, Mace?

35:57.572 --> 35:59.808
This is no mission with you,
it's a personal crusade!

35:59.908 --> 36:02.268
Now, you listen to me.
My brother didn't give up his life...

36:02.285 --> 36:04.354
- Your brother?
- So some yellow little...

36:04.454 --> 36:06.422
What about your brother?

36:11.086 --> 36:12.884
Well, I'll tell you.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.201
I was in command
of Balkan Intelligence in 1942.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.145
My brother was an officer
under my command.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.833
He was captured
and placed in Dubrovnik Fortress.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.651
What blame to you?

36:27.268 --> 36:29.337
There was certain information
I wanted from inside.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.173
He managed to find a way
to get it out to me.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.650
I ask again.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.952
What fault was yours?

36:36.569 --> 36:39.368
I waited too long before getting him out.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.225
So we're expected to buy
your honor, your vengeance

36:42.325 --> 36:44.769
and your military reputation?

36:44.869 --> 36:47.122
Why did they bust you, Major?

36:49.499 --> 36:51.001
Yes, it's true.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.845
They relieved me of my command.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.631
I couldn't...

36:57.465 --> 36:59.684
Couldn't carry on for a while.

37:19.362 --> 37:22.332
It's as much our mission as yours now.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.362
I agree that it's urgent.

37:35.462 --> 37:38.557
Petar may want to be loyal,
but not be able to.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.493
Can your people create a diversion for us?

37:41.593 --> 37:43.203
Blow up a gun or a guard post,

37:43.303 --> 37:46.706
anything to cover the sound
of an explosion within the tomb?

37:46.806 --> 37:50.026
- It will be done.
- We must get to the tomb at once.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.088
Scanlon might be able
to open an entrance to the drain

37:53.188 --> 37:54.964
without attracting attention.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.258
Someone must take explosives to him.

37:57.358 --> 38:00.595
It's almost curfew.
We can't risk the streets.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.699
I'll go, with the baby.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.872
If I am stopped,
I'll say he was taken ill.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.579
Isn't there another way?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.274
Not with speed.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.903
The rest of us can go across the roofs,
but it's gonna take some time.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.029
All right.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.723
By the time we get there,
Scanlon can have set the charges.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.353
All right, my friends, let's go. Hustle.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.646
He talked!

38:51.746 --> 38:55.024
If we're captured,
we'll need someone on the outside.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.276
We'll be waiting.

38:56.376 --> 38:59.095
When you break out, we'll be watching.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.497
I'm sorry, lads, but the smell
of this place is beginning to get to me.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.190
Get used to it.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.811
It's the smell of eternity.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.336
Oh, lad, you don't say much,

39:15.436 --> 39:18.631
but when you say something,
the things you say aren't very funny.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.983
Be quiet.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.558
Quiet.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.699
- Mila...
- Don't speak.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.806
Get going! Go on!

43:39.200 --> 43:40.452
Come on!

43:55.216 --> 43:58.516
- The entire garrison is after us.
- I can hear them!

44:09.147 --> 44:10.694
What happened?

44:10.982 --> 44:13.301
It's a bad thing that's happened, Rocca.

44:13.401 --> 44:14.573
Durrell

44:15.153 --> 44:16.746
killed the baby.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.580
Why?

44:19.198 --> 44:21.601
Oh, I'll tell you why.
Because he likes it.

44:21.701 --> 44:22.769
I think we can do without him!

44:22.869 --> 44:23.936
- Wait a minute.
- Hold it!

44:24.036 --> 44:25.438
It was an accident.
Do you understand that?

44:25.538 --> 44:28.024
She told me all about it.
The baby started to cry.

44:28.124 --> 44:31.845
He couldn't help it. It was an accident.
Do you understand?

45:22.845 --> 45:23.971
Mila.

45:25.473 --> 45:26.645
Mila.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.310
You must leave now.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.279
Take your child to the caretaker.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.486
See to its body.

45:54.502 --> 45:55.674
We...

45:57.672 --> 46:00.800
We will pray for its gentle soul, and you.

46:21.529 --> 46:22.781
Scanlon.

46:23.948 --> 46:26.497
Can you blast through to the prison?

46:26.951 --> 46:30.706
I can, but there's always
a possibility of it collapsing.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.753
What are the chances?

46:33.874 --> 46:35.296
Fifty-fifty.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.973
- All right, let's do it.
- Right.

46:59.066 --> 47:02.912
I speak to you in
your common language, I believe.

47:03.738 --> 47:07.459
There is a battery of mortars
trained on your hiding place.

47:08.409 --> 47:12.021
You may surrender
and be regarded as prisoners of war

47:12.121 --> 47:14.440
under the Geneva Convention,

47:14.540 --> 47:17.419
or I shall simply reduce you to dust.

47:18.419 --> 47:20.842
Thirty seconds for your decision.

47:25.509 --> 47:28.621
Are you crazy?
Let's blast our way out of here.

47:28.721 --> 47:29.938
Wait!

47:30.890 --> 47:33.834
Not one of us would get through that door.

47:33.934 --> 47:37.171
Now, please,
if you are prepared to surrender;

47:37.271 --> 47:40.650
step into the doorwvay,
one by one, without weapons.

47:42.318 --> 47:45.538
Our purpose was to get inside the prison.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.808
It seems we'll accomplish
at least that much.

47:48.908 --> 47:52.144
If we step out into that light,
they're gonna pick us off.

47:52.244 --> 47:54.167
What about that, Rocca?

47:56.290 --> 47:57.587
Come on.

48:16.185 --> 48:20.361
I think two intelligent men,
fighting on opposite sides,

48:20.981 --> 48:23.530
can trust each other for a moment.

48:24.276 --> 48:25.949
I don't think so.

48:27.822 --> 48:30.433
This is one of the consequences of war.

48:30.533 --> 48:35.414
We become enemies by general decree
from one day to another.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.750
Can't we forget the general decree?

48:39.166 --> 48:40.213
No.

48:40.668 --> 48:44.238
These uniforms make our decisions.

48:44.338 --> 48:46.215
We are both prisoners.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.853
All right, then.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.939
We'll take it slowly.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.792
Name, rank and serial number.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.086
My name is of no importance.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.733
I have no rank.

49:01.689 --> 49:03.924
The last number identified with me

49:04.024 --> 49:09.281
was 61235.

49:10.281 --> 49:12.955
- Why are you here?
- For two reasons.

49:13.409 --> 49:15.958
But I can't tell you either of them.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.962
Your wine is excellent.

49:22.626 --> 49:27.948
If you persist in this stubborn attitude,
I must resort to stronger measures.

49:28.048 --> 49:30.301
I believe you. I believe you.

49:32.428 --> 49:34.726
I do not make myself clear.

49:36.557 --> 49:41.462
There are men in my command adept
at keeping a man in hell for an eternity.

49:41.562 --> 49:44.298
They seem to have misjudged
Petar Marasovic.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.549
What do you mean?

49:45.649 --> 49:49.825
He must've kicked off before you got
all the information you wanted.

50:02.374 --> 50:03.967
Petar Marasovic.

50:16.889 --> 50:19.108
See? His death certificate.

51:28.377 --> 51:31.071
They will be in shortly.
Now, what have we?

51:31.171 --> 51:34.366
If I had the right ingredients,
I could blow this hellhole sky-high.

51:34.466 --> 51:37.119
I can forge his signature,
and with a little equipment, his seal.

51:37.219 --> 51:38.787
- Good.
- He's a couple of inches too short,

51:38.887 --> 51:40.581
but the glasses help. I can play the part.

51:40.681 --> 51:44.857
You fellows should feel at home here.
I'm a little out of my depth.

52:05.748 --> 52:08.376
Perhaps you'll enjoy sleeping in that.

52:09.918 --> 52:13.113
Tomorrow, we will begin
a new kind of questioning.

52:13.213 --> 52:18.553
In a little while, some or all of you
will be tempted to take your lives.

52:30.856 --> 52:34.952
I expect the Kommandant has talent
in the art of breaking men.

52:36.904 --> 52:38.097
We can't talk too soon,

52:38.197 --> 52:42.202
but there is no reason
to take all that he has to offer.

52:43.494 --> 52:45.371
We need a cover story.

52:46.121 --> 52:48.590
We'll tell him
we are an intelligence group

52:48.749 --> 52:52.253
preparing the way
for the invasion of the Balkans.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.766
Tomorrow, the pressure will begin.

53:22.741 --> 53:26.245
Now, which one shall we entertain first?

53:29.415 --> 53:31.133
The little fellow?

53:34.169 --> 53:35.671
The vain one?

53:38.382 --> 53:39.975
This quiet man?

53:45.139 --> 53:47.437
We mustn't forget the thinker.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.218
Never mind.

53:58.318 --> 54:00.537
Everyone will get his chance.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.666
It's a promise.

54:27.639 --> 54:31.439
Through the ages,
man has shown his greatest genius

54:32.352 --> 54:35.401
in the art of inflicting pain
upon his fellows.

54:37.357 --> 54:39.234
I have nothing to say.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.699
Let us talk as reasonable men.

54:47.910 --> 54:52.290
I recognize in you the bearing
and the discipline of a British officer.

54:55.250 --> 54:56.627
Very well.

54:57.044 --> 55:01.925
My name is Major Richard Mace
of His Majesty's Services, number 343602.

55:03.217 --> 55:04.514
A start.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.520
A start, Major.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.116
Please sit down, Major.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.698
Cigarette?

55:26.782 --> 55:28.034
Please.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.690
How's the caviar situation?

55:34.790 --> 55:36.383
It's improving.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.882
It's raw puke.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.595
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful?

55:45.217 --> 55:48.141
This little baby's gonna be
our rubber stamp.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.289
So you have come
to the grave of your brother.

56:13.453 --> 56:14.545
Yes.

56:15.789 --> 56:17.791
I'll show you his grave.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.962
The sea surrounds it.

56:50.949 --> 56:54.795
I recall your brother to be
an extremely stubborn Englishman.

56:55.662 --> 56:58.565
He never spoke one word
from the moment he entered this place

56:58.665 --> 57:00.793
till the moment he left it.

57:01.376 --> 57:03.799
I think I can do better with you.

57:06.632 --> 57:10.118
Well, what do you know?
Trickiest thing I ever saw.

57:10.218 --> 57:12.454
The fellow that built this place
really used his head.

57:12.554 --> 57:14.498
He figured one day he might
get himself caught in here,

57:14.598 --> 57:16.291
because you can get out from the inside.

57:16.391 --> 57:20.153
All I need is a simple little tool,
which I haven't got.

57:43.001 --> 57:44.753
A start, gentlemen.

57:45.045 --> 57:48.720
I'll let Captain Mace persuade you
to be more cooperative.

57:49.549 --> 57:50.846
Good day.

57:59.226 --> 58:02.070
- Easy with him, lads.
- Here we go. Come on.

58:08.026 --> 58:09.494
Here you are.

58:12.614 --> 58:13.724
Thank you.

58:13.824 --> 58:15.076
My God.

58:17.035 --> 58:19.504
Why didn't you use the cover story?

58:19.913 --> 58:20.914
Why?

58:21.498 --> 58:23.275
I didn't tell him anything.

58:23.375 --> 58:25.423
I just told him who I was.

58:26.336 --> 58:29.931
I wanted the Kommandant to know
why he was going to die.

58:35.095 --> 58:36.642
I've found him.

58:37.055 --> 58:38.352
Quadri.

58:38.932 --> 58:41.752
I was coming out of the Kommandant's
office, and there he was.

58:41.852 --> 58:43.024
Where?

58:43.895 --> 58:48.150
The corridor leading past
the infirmary to the seawall.

58:49.067 --> 58:51.616
And that's where they bury the dead.

58:54.197 --> 58:57.292
They would take a dead man
from the infirmary

58:58.118 --> 59:00.041
to the wall by the sea?

59:00.454 --> 59:01.751
Probably.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.298
We'll create a special body.

59:08.045 --> 59:10.924
Yeah, if we don't end up
corpses ourselves.

59:14.426 --> 59:17.805
It's clear that Captain Mace
is not a persuasive man.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.766
An informer hasn't come forward.

59:21.808 --> 59:24.903
I think it is time
for further experimentation.

59:26.646 --> 59:28.489
Now, who shall it be?

59:31.735 --> 59:33.453
No. No. Not today.

59:34.529 --> 59:39.080
You may prove useful after you have
an opportunity to see how others fare.

59:42.496 --> 59:43.839
I think...

59:47.375 --> 59:48.422
Yes.

59:49.419 --> 59:50.420
Becker!

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:01.665
How much can he take?

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.834
Seaman's such a little fellow.
I was getting to like him.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:06.962
Don't like anything so much
you can't see it die.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.862
Don't advise me, killer.
You destroy anything.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.424
You can't feel a human pain.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:11.867
Don't feel.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.511
It's you making that sound!

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:15.762
Stop it.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.079
Stop it!

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.791
Rocca, what the hell's with the...

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:24.796
We have to have precise timing,
or we fail.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:29.885
I'm snapping my fingers once a second.
It's becoming automatic.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:35.891
You begin by saying, "101, 102, 103."

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.394
You must make it automatic, too.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.143
It'll be your watch.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:47.319
And we must all be synchronized
to move on the exact second.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:50.902
Create a one-second tick
in your whole body.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:54.409
Because remember, a snap of the fingers

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.616
may save your life.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:04.416
I like to explain my techniques.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:11.590
Major Mace revealed little,
but then he had practically no persuasion.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:18.263
The Irisher told me a believable story
after he had his knuckles rapped.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:24.206
The next man will have more
to look forward to,

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:27.276
until I am sure I have the truth.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:30.274
So, you.

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:45.335
I'm sorry.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.378
That's all right.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.191
They didn't mess with my writing hand.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.734
Where's that seal?

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:55.028
You didn't have to take so much.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.863
You did all right up there.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.991
Besides, we feed it to those guys on a silver
platter and they're gonna smell a rat.

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:03.140
They dressed Scanlon's injuries.
Why not yours?

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:08.062
They've learned that men can sometimes
stand up to great physical pain,

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:14.381
then crack under a subtle doubt
or fear in the mind.

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.779
The fear of infection.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:21.034
Almost finished. Pretty damn good.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.000
Good job, Fell.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:30.647
If I only had something to make a lock pick
out of, we'd be out of here straightaway.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.733
Here. Here's an official piece of paper
I got off the Kommandant's office

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:37.508
while they were getting some water
to try to bring me to.

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.401
You.

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:28.430
Well.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:30.432
What have they done now?

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.184
Nothing.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:35.232
When do we all get executed?

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:38.649
- All of us except you, I mean!
- I said stop it!

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:42.677
I told you, the torture was subtle.

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:46.156
Now he's planting the seed
of disunity among us.

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:55.670
Thank them. You were almost dead.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.961
Oh, come on. Relax!

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.822
There's plenty of time for dying later.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:06.017
The time is closer than you think.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.684
Tomorrow, we will be free

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:12.600
or dead.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.235
Now, listen.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:24.445
We start the exodus
with men in three points.

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:33.416
I'm happy to see that one of you
has decided to be sensible.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:37.315
Well, among my associates
I'm known as a lover, not a fighter.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:42.592
Of course, I'll want corroboration
of what you tell me from your comrades.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:44.718
Companions.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:51.079
All the same, you may have
to stay another day or two with them.

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:55.975
And it would be best for them to think
that you were today's subject.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.317
Don't you mean victim?

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.441
A direct man.

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:04.951
I like that.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.160
Now, tell me.

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.501
Well, now, let me see, from the beginning.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:16.542
It all started in Cairo about a month ago.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.552
Guard! Guard!

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:13.179
Can you hear me?
There's a man hurt in here!

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.782
For God's sake, open up, will you?

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.243
There's a man hurt in here!

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:57.908
The whole plan was directed toward
an invasion through the Balkans.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.258
Your companion, the silent one,

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.185
has attempted suicide.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:23.390
He slashed his wrists,
deep, but not deep enough.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:48.501
Our mission was to set up security lines,

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.901
alert the Partisans,
chart minefields and defenses.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:56.384
This is essentially
what your companions have told me.

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:59.178
I want to know
why you were tunneling the fortress.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:00.805
What did you want here?

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:02.473
Well, this is the center
of your operations.

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.667
We were going to tap
into your lines, of course.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.807
That is not enough.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:31.603
There is more to the truth than that.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.196
Yes.

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:38.114
The simple truth is, you'll never know it.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.661
You're about to die.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.723
General Quadri! General Quadri!

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:52.625
We have no time to explain.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:56.337
We are Allies sent
to take you to the Partisans.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:57.964
What is it you want of me?

01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:02.152
Silence, and instant obedience
to our instructions.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.556
This is some sort of a trick.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.933
If you've come to kill me, shoot.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.910
I will not go with you.

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:16.173
I'm sorry, General Quadri.
We have no time to convince you.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.130
Halt!

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.628
Halt!

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:52.448
I'm hit!

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:53.549
I'm hit.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.318
Get going. Go on!

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:15.910
- Fell! Come on.
- I can't make it. Go on! Go!

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.029
Durrell!

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:08.711
This way!

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:17.725
- Company, halt!
- Company, halt!

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:29.569
All right, let's go.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:55.675
We are up here!

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:58.182
Here they are!

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:01.761
Go on, grab a rope.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:25.185
- I'm all right. Come on.
- No. You'll bleed to death.

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.126
That's fine. Fine.

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:34.194
All right, let's go. Let's go.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:44.779
Come on.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.115
Come on!

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:04.110
Durrell, what do you think you're doing?

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.808
Get up the hill.

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:16.809
Now, stay right there, me buckos,

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:19.978
and don't move out
of your little rock hut.

01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:23.127
This'll be a visit you won't forget.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:47.280
Scanlon's got a present for you
It'll be a big surprise

01:24:02.246 --> 01:24:04.294
Now, don't you dare move.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.610
And what it is I've got for you
Will open up your eyes

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.738
And what it is I've got for you
No store will ever sell

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:13.699
Now, just be steady, there.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.994
That's 'cause what it is I've got for you

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:19.973
Will blow you all to...

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:25.270
I've had it. I can't go any further.

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:26.605
Don't give up.

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:29.483
We'll cross the river
and come out downstream. Come on.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:31.585
No. You cross the river.

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:34.321
I've got a way of making them follow me.

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:37.265
I'm gonna give them a run for their money.

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:42.767
It's up to you, now, Rocca.
You're in command.

01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:44.564
Get going.

01:25:51.355 --> 01:25:52.607
Let's go.

01:25:56.526 --> 01:25:57.823
Rocca?

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:39.693
Come on.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.757
Where are the others?

01:28:58.542 --> 01:28:59.634
Dead.

01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:25.447
This man is not General Quadri.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:43.170
My men are dying because of you, impostor.

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:49.471
Durrell!

01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:54.772
Get him inside.

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:19.731
They couldn't trust the General,
but they needed him to control the troops,

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:22.050
so they killed him

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:25.045
and substituted a double.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.761
For a moment, he fooled me.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.264
He looks almost exactly like him.

01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:45.194
So,

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:50.571
we kill ourselves for an imposter.

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.657
Rocca, why did you stop me?

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:00.372
To save our beloved General Quadri.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.208
Why let this stop us?

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:04.609
Why?

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.194
We'll use him.

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:08.547
We'll complete Mace's mission.

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:11.341
Clean your face.

01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:14.306
We want you to look good.

01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:19.499
We're going back to the Fortress.

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:20.917
We'll take him.

01:31:21.017 --> 01:31:25.022
The great impostor is not yet out of work.

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:26.944
I will not help you.

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:28.567
You know that!

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:33.163
You will lead your troops into battle
against the Germans,

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:36.249
or my friend here will kill you,

01:31:36.616 --> 01:31:39.911
very slowly and very painfully.

01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:35.554
- Quadri! Quadri!
- Quadri! Quadri!

01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:50.256
You see how they love me?

01:32:50.356 --> 01:32:51.716
Kill me now

01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:53.659
and see what happens.

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:01.994
I shall lead my men into battle
with the Germans.

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:03.995
If you kill me for it,

01:33:05.038 --> 01:33:06.898
my men will kill you.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:11.486
And you will die in vain, because
they will fight on for their dead general,

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.680
on the side of the Germans.

01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:19.053
- Quadri! Quadri! Quadri!
- Quadri! Quadri! Quadri!

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:25.609
Not if they thought
he were killed by a German.
