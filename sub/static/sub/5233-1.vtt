24:32.621 --> 24:35.576

It might jeopardize the deal,

24:35.676 --> 24:38.708
so listen up.

24:49.455 --> 24:53.657
I pay you for options, all right?
So give me one!

24:56.062 --> 24:58.564

the goddamn deal, all right?

24:58.664 --> 25:01.434

if they find out about this.

27:03.189 --> 27:07.827

This is not only about me.

27:14.533 --> 27:18.002

if you sell the company to the Chinese?

27:20.472 --> 27:23.276
Let me ask you a question.

27:23.876 --> 27:28.546
What will the law think when they find
two different bullets in the same body?

27:41.360 --> 27:46.630
They might think whoever shot this man
didn't do it accidentally.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.902
'Cause you sure can't shoot
a man accidentally twice.

27:53.472 --> 27:54.702
What did you do?

27:55.458 --> 27:57.291
Huh?

27:58.110 --> 28:00.580
I mean, you can't frame me for this.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.748
I mean, there'll be an investigation.
You know that.

28:02.848 --> 28:07.286
Nobody cares about this man.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.889
But you bring this body back

28:09.989 --> 28:12.191
and they put it on me,

28:12.291 --> 28:14.258
they can put it on you.

28:15.661 --> 28:19.571
50-50, Ben. Do you like those odds?

28:26.738 --> 28:30.507
Let's, uh... look at this another way.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.780
Suppose that I put a call
in that university.

28:34.880 --> 28:39.018
You know, grease the wheels
and I get you admitted.

28:39.418 --> 28:43.489
I could provide a full ride
all four years.

28:43.589 --> 28:46.371

- Just stop. Come on, you're insane.

28:46.471 --> 28:49.061
Let's just say you major in finance.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.631
So maybe I got a position
waiting for you.

28:51.731 --> 28:56.368

28:56.468 --> 28:58.613

29:04.309 --> 29:08.180

to relocate to Beijing.

even imagine right now,

29:14.987 --> 29:19.789

lodged in old Charlie.

29:34.039 --> 29:35.773
