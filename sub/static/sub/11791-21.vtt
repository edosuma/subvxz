DRESS, OK? A "D" WILL DO.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.287
DIDN'T THIS ALL START BECAUSE

10:30.290 --> 10:31.359
SHE HAD BACK PAIN? I MEAN, NOW

10:31.360 --> 10:32.850
WE'RE KILLING TWO BIG-TITTED

10:32.860 --> 10:35.158
BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.354
WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME ON,

10:36.360 --> 10:37.292
HANG AROUND. THIS IS HISTORY

10:37.300 --> 10:40.463
RIGHT HERE.

10:40.470 --> 10:45.134
THIS...MY LAST SURGERY.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.233
NO MORE LIPO ON CHUNKY DIVORCEES

10:47.240 --> 10:51.108
OR RHINOPLASTIES ON SELF-HATING

10:51.110 --> 10:53.840
JEWESSES. IAM FREE, BABY.

10:53.850 --> 10:55.772
I'M TAKING LIZZY AND THE KID TO

ITALY. WE'RE GONNA EAT LIKE

10:56.850 --> 10:57.885
PIGS. I MEAN, WHO CARES IF I GET

10:57.890 --> 11:00.757
FAT, RIGHT? HA HA.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.228
WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT?

11:03.230 --> 11:04.254
LISTEN, I'VE HAD TO ACCEPT THIS

11:04.260 --> 11:05.284
AND YOU WILL, TOO, ALL RIGHT?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.450
WHICH IS WHY, I'M GONNA START

11:06.460 --> 11:08.291
INTERVIEWING REPLACEMENTS.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.289
>> WHO SAYS I WANNA HIRE SOMEONE

11:09.300 --> 11:10.096
NEW?

11:10.100 --> 11:11.260
>> OH, YOU THINK YOU CAN KEEP

11:11.270 --> 11:12.464

11:12.470 --> 11:14.335

11:14.340 --> 11:16.331
HOURS A WEEK. I OWN HALF OF

11:16.340 --> 11:18.160
THAT, WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN

11:18.170 --> 11:20.070
I'M DEAD, THAT MONEY GOES TO

11:20.080 --> 11:21.934
LIZZY AND THE KID. I DON'T WANT

11:21.940 --> 11:23.077
THEM TO MISS OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE

11:23.080 --> 11:26.140
SO DEPRESSED YOU CAN'T GET REAL.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.184
>> THEY'LL BE TAKEN CARE OF.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.112
YOU KNOW THAT. EVEN IF I HAVE TO

11:35.120 --> 11:36.951
PAY THEM OUT OF MY OWN POCKET.

11:36.960 --> 11:37.984
I JUST THINK IT'S A LITTLE

11:37.990 --> 11:38.957
MORBID TO START INTERVIEWING

11:38.960 --> 11:39.824
PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE STILL

11:39.830 --> 11:40.922
SEEMINGLY HEALTHY.

11:40.930 --> 11:41.897

11:41.900 --> 11:42.924
BEST I CAN TO KEEP IT TOGETHER

11:42.930 --> 11:44.795
ABOUT ALL OF THIS. IT'S NOT EASY

11:44.800 --> 11:45.789
KNOWING THAT YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS

11:45.800 --> 11:49.099
GONNA GO ON WITHOUT YOU.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.237
I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT THE GUY

11:50.240 --> 11:51.537
STANDING OPPOSITE YOU IN THE

11:51.540 --> 11:53.201
SCRUB ROOM EVERY DAY IS THERE

11:53.210 --> 11:56.270

12:10.130 --> 12:11.324
CAN YOU, UH, CAN YOU CALL ME

12:11.330 --> 12:17.189
WHEN SHE'S COMING OUT?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.269
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET HIM GO,

12:18.270 --> 12:20.932
SEAN. THAT MAN IS DYING AND NOT

12:20.940 --> 12:22.237
IN A METAPHYSICAL "WE'RE ALL

12:22.240 --> 12:24.128
DYING" KIND OF WAY. HE'S GOING

12:24.140 --> 12:27.303
TO BE A GHOST BEFORE HALLOWEEN.

12:27.310 --> 12:28.334
LIFE IS CHANGING. YOU CAN EITHER

RIDE THE WAVE OR GET SMASHED TO

12:30.550 --> 12:32.506
SMITHEREENS ON THE ROCKS.

12:32.510 --> 12:33.818
>> IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.348
I'M SORRY. I KNOW I GET A LITTLE

14:16.350 --> 14:17.510
CARRIED AWAY. MY MOTHER WAS IN

14:17.520 --> 14:19.613
THE BUSINESS. I GREW UP AROUND

14:19.620 --> 14:24.956
THIS STUFF.

THEN TOUCH THE SKY

18:35.840 --> 18:37.899
TOO LATE

TO KEEP THE WORLD

18:39.510 --> 18:40.545
FROM DYING

18:40.550 --> 18:43.747
IT'S NOT TOO LATE

18:43.750 --> 18:47.186
TO SPARE THE LOVE YOU HAVE

19:29.930 --> 19:31.921
TO BLOW OFF STEAM.

19:31.930 --> 19:32.965
OF COURSE HE GOT THE DANCES

19:32.970 --> 19:35.939
FOR FREE. THIS DOESN'T MAKE

19:35.940 --> 19:37.305
ANY SENSE ANYMORE.

PARTY. I MEAN, HE'S NOT JUST

19:41.410 --> 19:44.800
GETTING MARRIED. HE'S LEAVING.

19:44.810 --> 19:47.540
THE 20 YEARS WORKING TOGETHER.

19:47.550 --> 19:48.539
I SUDDENLY DON'T HAVE A PARTNER

19:48.550 --> 19:53.886
ANYMORE.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.585
>> YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND, SEAN.

19:55.590 --> 19:56.682
I KNOW I CAN NEVER REPLACE

19:56.690 --> 19:58.851
CHRISTIAN. BUT IF YOU GIVE ME

19:58.860 --> 20:00.555
A CHANCE, I KNOW WE COULD MAKE

20:00.560 --> 20:02.027
A GOOD TEAM.

20:02.030 --> 20:08.765
>> IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

20:08.770 --> 20:09.668
>> WELL HEY, NOW THAT YOU

20:09.670 --> 20:10.864
MENTION IT, I REALLY CAN'T SEE

20:10.870 --> 20:12.633
CELEBRATING IN THIS DUMP ANYWAY.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.902
IT'S GROTESQUE.

20:13.910 --> 20:15.537
>> GIRLS AREN'T SO BAD.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.837
>> THE GIRLS ARE TOP SHELF.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.875
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

20:17.880 --> 20:18.801
UPHOLSTERY ON THAT COUCH,

20:18.810 --> 20:19.845
IT'S ALL FRAYED, THERE'S FOOD

20:19.850 --> 20:21.579
STAINS ON THE CARPET. AND I

20:21.580 --> 20:22.979
DON'T EVEN WANNA KNOW WHAT YOU

20:22.980 --> 20:24.880
CAN SEE IF YOU SHINE A BLACK

20:24.890 --> 20:26.380
LIGHT ON THE CHAIRS IN THE VIP

20:26.390 --> 20:28.051
ROOM. ARE YOU HUNGRY? 'CAUSE I

20:28.060 --> 20:29.413
KNOW A GREAT PLACE TO GRAB

20:29.420 --> 20:30.887
A BITE. IT'S NOT TOO FAR FROM

20:30.890 --> 20:32.687
HERE, AND IT'S REALLY TASTEFULLY

20:32.690 --> 20:34.897
DECORATED.

20:34.900 --> 20:39.792
>> SURE.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.893
>> YOU'RE SUCH A LUCKY DUCKLING,

20:41.900 --> 20:44.664
MIJA, TO HAVE A HANDSOME PRINCE

20:44.670 --> 20:45.864
WITH THE POWER TO TURN YOU

20:45.870 --> 20:46.962
INTO A SWAN.

20:46.970 --> 20:48.676
>> OW. THAT HURTS.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.874
>> THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE

20:49.880 --> 20:51.404
TENDER, OK? NO FONDLING FOR

20:51.410 --> 20:53.844
A WEEK. DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL

20:53.850 --> 20:55.408
LEARN TO LOVE IT DOGGIE STYLE.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.341
>> CHRISTIAN, MY MOTHER IS

20:56.350 --> 20:57.681
STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.079
>> AY, THAT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.079
NOTHING BETWEEN A MAN AND

21:01.090 --> 21:05.083
A WOMAN IS EVER WRONG.

21:05.090 --> 21:06.022
>> THERE WE GO. PERFECT

21:06.030 --> 21:08.828
TEARDROPS.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.632
>> THEY'RE MORE LIKE WATER

21:17.640 --> 21:19.528
BALLOONS.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.428
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO WHAT WE

21:21.440 --> 21:22.372
DECIDED?

21:22.380 --> 21:23.369
>> LOOK, I TOOK THEM DOWN SO YOU

21:23.380 --> 21:24.347
DON'T NEED BACK SURGERY AS YOU

21:24.350 --> 21:26.102
GET OLDER, PERIOD.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.372
AS FAR AS GETTING RID OF THE TWO

21:27.380 --> 21:28.017
MOST BEAUTIFUL ASSETS YOU

21:28.020 --> 21:29.078
HAVE, I MADE AN EXECUTIVE

21:29.080 --> 21:30.479
DECISION. ONE THAT WE COULD BOTH

21:30.490 --> 21:32.879
BENEFIT FROM.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.387
>> HUH. YOU'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED

21:39.390 --> 21:41.722
YET AND YOU'RE LYING TO HER.

21:41.730 --> 21:42.719
THAT WAS A BAD DECISION

21:42.730 --> 21:44.459
FOR YOU TO MAKE. MY DAUGHTER IS

21:44.470 --> 21:45.869
IN CHARGE OF HER OWN BODY.

21:45.870 --> 21:46.768
>> MOM.

21:46.770 --> 21:47.930
>> YOU'RE IN CHARGE--

21:47.940 --> 21:52.138
>> AH! PLEASE STOP. PLEASE.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.404
CHRISTIAN, I AM IN CHARGE OF

21:54.410 --> 21:56.833
MY OWN BODY.

22:05.720 --> 22:06.812
>> THEN WHY DON'T YOU ORDER YOUR

22:06.820 --> 22:08.151
BODY TO PUT THIS ON INSTEAD OF

22:08.160 --> 22:11.527
THAT MOTH-RIDDEN RELIC?

22:11.530 --> 22:16.149
>> OH, MY GOD.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.661
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.592
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS GORGEOUS.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.033
SORRY, MOM. OH, MY GOD, IT'S

22:21.040 --> 22:22.166
GORGEOUS.

22:22.170 --> 22:25.037
>> IT'S NOT YOU.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.166
BUT YOU WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW

22:26.170 --> 22:28.536
HOW RICH AND GLAMOROUS YOU ARE?

22:28.540 --> 22:29.700
OR DO YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR

22:29.710 --> 22:32.440
SACRED VOWS IN THE SAME BLESSED

22:32.450 --> 22:34.008
TRADITION PASSED ON FROM MOTHER

22:34.020 --> 22:36.614
TO DAUGHTER FOR GENERATIONS?

22:42.420 --> 22:45.480
>> * SOMETHING IN YOUR EYES

22:45.490 --> 22:47.151
WAS SO INVITING... *

22:47.160 --> 22:49.196
>> MA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

22:49.200 --> 22:50.098
>> I'M GONNA PHONE YOUR

22:50.100 --> 22:51.067
GRANDMOTHER AND TELL HER THE

22:51.070 --> 22:54.597
NEWS. DIOS MIO. ME VA A MATAR.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.828
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME. AND WHEN

22:55.840 --> 22:58.900
SHE DOES, ENJOY YOUR WEDDING.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.499
>> MAYBE WILBER'S WIFE COULD--

23:04.510 --> 23:05.545
>> ONE MORE WORD AND I'LL CHANGE

23:05.550 --> 23:08.747
MY WILL.

23:08.750 --> 23:12.049
>> * STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT

23:12.050 --> 23:14.553
EXCHANGING GLANCES

23:14.560 --> 23:17.529
WONDERING IN THE NIGHT

23:17.530 --> 23:19.521
WHAT WERE THE CHANCES... *

23:19.530 --> 23:21.452
>> HERE'S THE KEY. DR. TROY

23:21.460 --> 23:22.688
SAID TO MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.065
> > THAN KS.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.560
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.821
>> * ...BEFORE THE NIGHT

23:26.830 --> 23:30.539
WAS THROUGH

23:30.540 --> 23:33.668
SOMETHING IN YOUR EYES

23:33.680 --> 23:35.978
WAS SO INVITING

23:35.980 --> 23:39.108
SOMETHING IN YOUR SMILE

23:39.110 --> 23:41.578
WAS SO EXCITING

23:41.580 --> 23:42.649
SOMETHING IN MY HEART

23:42.650 --> 23:44.914
TOLD ME I MUST HAVE YOU

23:52.530 --> 23:55.624
STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT

23:55.630 --> 23:57.257
TWO LONELY PEOPLE

23:57.260 --> 24:00.696
WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT

24:00.700 --> 24:02.588
UP TO THE MOMENT

24:02.600 --> 24:06.036
WHEN WE SAID OUR FIRST HELLO

24:06.040 --> 24:08.508
LITTLE DID WE KNOW

24:08.510 --> 24:11.877
LOVE WAS JUST A GLANCE AWAY

24:11.880 --> 24:16.010
A WARM, EMBRACING DANCE AWAY

24:16.020 --> 24:19.012
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT

24:19.020 --> 24:21.250
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

24:21.260 --> 24:24.559
LOVERS AT FIRST SIGHT

24:24.560 --> 24:26.778
IN LOVE FOREVER

24:26.790 --> 24:29.793
IT TURNED OUT SO RIGHT

24:29.800 --> 24:32.894
FOR STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT *

24:54.790 --> 24:56.109
>> * LOVE WAS JUST

24:56.120 --> 24:58.259
A GLANCE AWAY

24:58.260 --> 25:04.699
A WARM, EMBRACING DANCE AWAY

25:04.700 --> 25:07.737
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT

25:07.740 --> 25:10.038
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

25:10.040 --> 25:13.305
LOVERS AT FIRST SIGHT

25:13.310 --> 25:15.631
IN LOVE FOREVER

25:15.640 --> 25:18.939
IT TURNED OUT SO RIGHT

25:18.950 --> 25:21.214
FOR STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT

25:26.820 --> 25:29.584
DOOBY DOOBY DOO *

25:29.590 --> 25:30.659
>> I JUST WISH YOU WOULDN'T

25:30.660 --> 25:31.649
HAND OVER YOUR OFFICE TO HIM

25:31.660 --> 25:32.786
SO SOON.

25:32.790 --> 25:33.757
>> I'M NOT GONNA BE USING IT

25:33.760 --> 25:35.648
NOW. AND HE REALLY LOVES

25:35.660 --> 25:38.663
MY DECOR. HA.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.195
>> * DOOBY DOOBY DO... *

25:41.200 --> 25:44.260
>> AH!

25:44.270 --> 25:47.239
JEEZ.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.781
>> THAT WAS AWKWARD, HUH?

26:00.790 --> 26:01.609
>> WELL WHAT THE HELL WERE

26:01.620 --> 26:02.712
YOU DOING?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.721
>> WERE YOU MASTURBATING?

26:03.730 --> 26:04.924
>> PROBABLY LOOKED THAT WAY.

26:04.930 --> 26:05.828
>> LIKE YOU WERE SCREWING AN

26:05.830 --> 26:07.354
INVISIBLE WOMAN ON MY COUCH.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.850
>> IT WAS NO INVISIBLE WOMAN.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.919
>> YOU WERE SCREWING THE COUCH?

26:10.930 --> 26:12.363
>> GENTLEMEN, I'M COMPLETELY

26:12.370 --> 26:16.261
EMBARRASSED. SO LET ME APOLOGIZE

26:16.270 --> 26:19.307
AND EXPLAIN. I STRUGGLE WITH

26:19.310 --> 26:21.005
OBJECT UM SEXUALITY.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.170
>> WHAT'S THAT, COUCH-BANGING

26:22.180 --> 26:22.999
IN ENGLISH?

26:23.010 --> 26:23.942
>> O.S. IS NOT A WIDELY KNOWN

26:23.950 --> 26:25.406
CONDITION. IT'S BARELY

26:25.410 --> 26:30.040
UNDERSTOOD. BUT IT IS REAL.

26:30.050 --> 26:31.688
THOSE OF US WHO IDENTIFY

26:31.690 --> 26:34.181
OURSELVES WITH O.S. ARE FULLY

26:34.190 --> 26:36.385
CAPABLE OF FORMING A STRONG

26:36.390 --> 26:38.858
RELATIONSHIP WITH...PHYSICAL

26:38.860 --> 26:40.418
OBJECTS. IT STEMS FROM A BELIEF

26:40.430 --> 26:44.662
IN ANIMISM.

26:44.670 --> 26:47.798
>> WAIT A SECOND. SO YOU BELIEVE

26:47.800 --> 26:50.064
THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS CAN BE

26:50.070 --> 26:51.264
SENTIENT BEINGS?

26:51.270 --> 26:53.738
>> LIKE US, THEY HAVE FEELINGS.

26:53.740 --> 26:56.937
THEY CAN COMMUNICATE,

26:56.940 --> 26:58.009
EVEN EXPRESS LOVE.

26:58.010 --> 26:58.840
>> SO ALL THIS CRAP ABOUT

26:58.850 --> 26:59.976
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE INTERVIEW,

26:59.980 --> 27:01.140
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SCREWING

27:01.150 --> 27:02.048
ONE OF THE FLOOR MODELS

27:02.050 --> 27:03.074
AT POTTERY BARN.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.012
>> I DO HAVE NORMAL

27:04.020 --> 27:05.317
RELATIONSHIPS WITH WOMEN.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.050
THEY'RE JUST NOT AS SATISFYING.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.357
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF GENDER

27:09.360 --> 27:10.725
ASSIGNMENTS WITH CARS, BOATS,

27:10.730 --> 27:11.424
BUILDINGS--

27:11.430 --> 27:12.454
>> THE DIFFERENCE IS I'VE NEVER

27:12.460 --> 27:14.428
STUCK MY DICK IN A TAILPIPE.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.455
>> I TRY TO FIGHT THE URGE.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.427
I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT

27:17.430 --> 27:19.728
I COULD BE CAPABLE OF FINDING

27:20.700 --> 27:24.466
FURNITURE SO ATTRACTIVE.

27:24.470 --> 27:25.300
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING

27:25.310 --> 27:27.460
IRRESISTIBLE TO ME ABOUT A

27:27.470 --> 27:32.373
REALLY WELL-BUILT PIECE.

27:32.380 --> 27:33.916
MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN

27:33.920 --> 27:35.717
ATTRACT ED TO PERFECTION IN ALL

27:35.720 --> 27:39.212
OF ITS FORMS. AS PLASTIC

27:39.220 --> 27:40.756
SURGEONS YOU CAN RELATE,

27:40.760 --> 27:43.388
CAN'T YOU?

27:43.390 --> 27:46.780
>> GET OUT.

27:46.790 --> 27:52.490
GET OUT!

27:52.500 --> 27:53.489
NEXT TIME I'LL DO A BACKGROUND

27:53.500 --> 27:56.833
CHECK.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.229
>> YEAH.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.348
>> YOU'RE RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.395
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.219
>> YOU'RE VERY GOOD,

28:24.230 --> 28:26.869
DR. MCNAMARA, BUT I THINK IT'S

28:26.870 --> 28:28.269
GOING TO TAKE SOMETIME TO GET

28:28.270 --> 28:30.397
USED TO THESE.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.469
>> THEY'LL LOSE SOME VOLUME ONCE

28:31.470 --> 28:32.539
THE SWELLING GOES DOWN.

28:32.540 --> 28:35.771
>> NO. I LIKE THIS SIZE.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.772
IT'S JUST THAT I'M A SHY PERSON.

28:38.780 --> 28:41.317
I'M NOT USED TO BEING SO OUT

28:41.320 --> 28:42.412
THERE.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.218
>> THERE'S MY BABY.

28:45.220 --> 28:47.085
DID I TELL YOU, TITO?

28:47.090 --> 28:48.785
REINCARNATED AS GINA

28:48.790 --> 28:50.781
LOLLOBRIGIDA, AND SHE'S NOT EVEN

28:50.790 --> 28:52.382
ALL HEALED UP YET.

28:52.390 --> 28:54.028
>> HELLO, ALLEGRA.

28:54.030 --> 28:56.055
>> WHAT IS HE DOING HERE, MANNY?

28:56.060 --> 28:57.357
>> OH, HE INSISTED ON BEING HERE

28:57.360 --> 28:59.521
FOR YOUR RECOVERY.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.259
WHAT A GUY, RIGHT?

29:01.270 --> 29:02.897
SORRY, DR. MCNAMARA, THIS IS

29:02.900 --> 29:05.107
TITO.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.862
>> OUR BUTCHER FROM COCONUT

29:06.870 --> 29:08.804
GROVE.

29:14.550 --> 29:17.075
>> MY BEST BRISKET.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.411
I KNOW HOW YOU LOVE IT.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.409
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE LOOK ON

29:19.420 --> 29:22.014
THE X-RAY GUY'S FACE AT THE

29:22.020 --> 29:23.089
AIRPORT.

29:23.090 --> 29:24.250
>> I'M SORRY, MR. CALDARELLO,

29:24.260 --> 29:26.080
BUT WE ONLY ALLOW FAMILY IN

29:26.090 --> 29:27.284
RECOVERY.

29:27.290 --> 29:29.190
>> BUT TITO IS FAMILY. AT LEAST

29:29.200 --> 29:31.498
HE WILL BE AFTER I DIE AND

29:31.500 --> 29:34.094
HE MARRIES ALLEGRA.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.398
>> HIM?

29:36.400 --> 29:37.332
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND A

29:37.340 --> 29:39.205
BETTER CANDIDATE. THAT BUTCHER

29:39.210 --> 29:41.132
SHOP IS A CASH COW.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.529
HE'S A WIDOWER, AND HIS LITTLE

29:43.540 --> 29:45.246
GIRL CONNIE IS PREGNANT WITH

29:45.250 --> 29:48.048
TWINS. I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANT

29:48.050 --> 29:48.948
GRANDBABIES.

29:48.950 --> 29:49.974
>> YOU CAN'T HANDPICK YOUR

29:49.980 --> 29:51.083
WIFE'S SECOND HUSBAND.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.318
>> WE NEVER AGREED TO THIS,

29:52.320 --> 29:53.446
MAN NY.

29:53.450 --> 29:55.179
>> I'M JUST HELPING MOVE THE

29:55.190 --> 29:58.921
PROCESS ALONG. I KNOW MY WIFE

29:58.930 --> 30:00.921
BETTER THAN SHE KNOWS HERSELF.
