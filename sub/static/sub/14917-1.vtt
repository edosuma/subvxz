00:00.070 --> 00:01.930
Previously on "brothers & sisters".

00:02.040 --> 00:04.490
-I now pronounce them.
-married.

00:04.590 --> 00:06.800
You owe a substantial amount of money.

00:06.890 --> 00:08.950
A merger is our only offer.

00:09.050 --> 00:09.940
Who would run the company?

00:10.040 --> 00:11.610
Sarah and I would be copresidents.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.230
Holly will assume the
role of chairman and C.E.O.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.329
-Let's adopt.
-Oh,robert.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.930
Rebecca is not your biological sister.

00:18.930 --> 00:22.310
What if it was all
just a way to meet you?

00:22.440 --> 00:25.480
The only reason dad left you any money was
that he thought that rebecca was his daughter.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.870
-Are you joking? -Explain
his passwords then--

00:27.880 --> 00:30.960
the initials of all his
children,the last one was "R.

00:31.060 --> 00:33.130
" There was another "r,"
but it was never rebecca.

00:33.230 --> 00:36.430
It was a boy,and his name was ryan.

00:36.510 --> 00:39.030
Mom,we have something
we need to tell you.

00:39.670 --> 00:43.890
"dear birth mother,"my
name is sarah walker.

00:43.970 --> 00:49.390
"If you're reading this,"you must be hoping
to find someone "to adopt your unborn baby.

00:49.480 --> 00:55.030
"There is no one I know who would be a
better mother "than my little sister kitty.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.910
"First let me tell you a
little about our family.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.020
"Justin,the baby of the
family,"is a war veteran.

01:03.100 --> 01:07.080
"Kevin is a lawyer who
married his partner scotty.

01:07.190 --> 01:11.710
"And tommy,the oldest of the
boys,he's married to julia.

01:11.770 --> 01:16.150
"He runs our family business,which
now includes a winery.

01:16.230 --> 01:21.470
"As crazy as it sounds,"they
are each other's best friends.

01:21.630 --> 01:24.690
"And what holds this big brood together?

01:24.760 --> 01:27.670
"Our mother nora.

01:27.750 --> 01:31.070
"A better role model "I
could not wish for any mother.

01:31.150 --> 01:34.750
"A better grandmother "I
could not wish for your baby.

01:34.830 --> 01:39.110
"A better friend I could
not wish for the world.

01:39.230 --> 01:44.060
"And when she brings us all
together,"it is family at its best.

01:44.110 --> 01:50.070
"A walker dinner is a sight to
behold. "The love just radiates.

01:50.140 --> 01:56.450
"And any new baby would be welcome "into
this joyous scene with open arms and hearts.

01:56.530 --> 02:04.380
"But no heart is bigger,no arms more
open "than my wonderful sister kitty.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.780
"Imagine a fountain "that
overflows with unconditional love.

02:08.860 --> 02:12.590
"Imagine a magical glue
that holds people together.

02:12.660 --> 02:15.490
"Imagine a pied piper from pasadena.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.440
"Children are drawn to
her wherever she goes.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.740
"That's our kitty.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.220
"What gives this remarkable
woman her strength?

02:25.300 --> 02:31.710
"We do-- her brothers,her
sister,her mother,her family.

02:31.770 --> 02:33.280
"  blah,blah,blah,blah,blah,blah.

02:33.390 --> 02:35.660
It goes on like that for six pages.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.940
I mean,some poor woman could spend her entire
last trimester slogging through this thing.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.940
I don't think she wrote it. I
think she got it off the internet

02:41.980 --> 02:44.140
at schmaltz-fest.Com.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.580
More likely she sat down one night,

02:45.670 --> 02:49.200
cracked open a bottle of merlot and just
kept writing until she lost consciousness.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.020
Maybe she hired somebody to write it.

02:51.110 --> 02:53.390
I mean,you gotta admit,this
is laying it on pretty thick.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.460
Honey,we're asking someone
to give us their child.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.210
It's hardly a time for humility.

02:57.290 --> 02:58.920
We should be glad she finished it.

02:58.980 --> 03:00.870
Yeah,I guess you're right.

03:00.950 --> 03:03.400
There's no point in obsessing over it.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.380
Exactly.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.420
look how long it is.

03:06.540 --> 03:09.410
well,is it a crime to go on about
how much you love your sister?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.370
Well,she goes on about everybody.

03:11.460 --> 03:12.110
What'd she say about me?

03:12.210 --> 03:13.850
Nothing compared to
what she says about mom.

03:14.030 --> 03:15.780
Get--oh,here. Get
a load of this.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.260
"A better grandmother I
could not wish for your baby.

03:18.360 --> 03:22.100
A better friend I could
not wish for the world.

03:22.180 --> 03:23.290
" Okay,the world.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.430
All right. Maybe it's
a little over the top.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.780
But what do you want her to do,be honest?
She's trying to put us all in the best light.

03:28.810 --> 03:29.950
justin?

03:31.030 --> 03:31.630
hi.

03:31.730 --> 03:32.840
What are you doing here?

03:32.960 --> 03:35.180
-Does she need a reason?
-No.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.410
Actually,I was just,uh,I was gonna
ask you if I could borrow the,

03:38.470 --> 03:40.600
-uh,the lamp in the attic?
-The floorlamp?

03:40.670 --> 03:42.100
-Yeah.
-Absolutely. Take it.

03:42.100 --> 03:42.960
Awesome. Thank you.

03:43.010 --> 03:44.190
How's--how's
your place?

03:44.270 --> 03:46.220
Uh,you know,right now
it's so empty it echoes.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.650
But,hey,at least with the lamp,now
I'll be able to see what I don't have.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.210
do you even have any sheets and towels?

03:51.310 --> 03:52.510
Oh,nora,it's okay. Really.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.910
No,no,go up to the
closet. Take some linens.

03:54.940 --> 03:56.870
I have more sets than
I know what to do with.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.060
Really?

03:58.100 --> 03:59.610
Cool. Thanks.

03:59.690 --> 04:00.560
uh,okay.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.380
Oh,she better not take
the ones with e robots.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.170
Those are my--
you remember those.

04:04.230 --> 04:06.170
Yeah,well,I gotta go,mom.
I'll catch you later.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.120
Well,don't forget your letter.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.440
I'm tellin' ya,there's a
ghostwriter in here somewhere.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.290
don't be silly.

04:14.010 --> 04:15.960
When you see her,you
might wanna thank her.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.420
Well,if she ever stops
rescheduling our plans,maybe I will.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.829
All right.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.220
Fine.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.000
Oh,god. You didn't tell
her you wrote it,did you?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.950
Of course not. Have
you even read it yet?

04:26.990 --> 04:30.310
Well,I tried. I fell
asleep on page four.

04:30.350 --> 04:31.150
Oh,for god sake'S.

04:31.250 --> 04:34.990
Would you please read it so at least you
can be familiar with what it is you said?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.310
I should have just told her
the truth--I'm insanely busy,

04:36.400 --> 04:39.980
the kids are driving me
crazy,not to mention holly.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.300
No,no,no. You can't tell her the truth.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.920
She's so stressed out by all of
this,and it'll just hurt her feelings.

04:46.030 --> 04:48.600
Sarah,just don't act
guilty. It'll all blow over.

04:48.630 --> 04:51.450
Mother,you should know that the
cover-up is always worse than the crime.

04:51.530 --> 04:53.760
Didn't you learn anything from dad?

04:53.920 --> 04:56.640
God,sarah. You don't
have to slam things.

04:56.650 --> 04:59.980
If you would stop dredging up the
past,then your father wouldn't be an issue.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.510
Mom,I'm not dredging up anything,

05:01.630 --> 05:03.540
and I'm trying to get the
air conditioning to come on,

05:03.660 --> 05:09.920
and excuse me if I'm a little curious about the fact
that I have a half brother lurking out there somewhere.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.690
I told you I don't want to
talk about this ryan person.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.470
Read the letter. We never
had this conversation.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.570
Okay,mata hari.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.000
we're being summoned,sarah.

05:20.090 --> 05:21.830
-By the almighty?
-Yeah.

05:23.550 --> 05:25.940
We're gonna condense
the packaging department.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.120
Walker landing has a
more efficient system,so--

05:28.120 --> 05:31.190
w-wait a minute.Are you telling me that you're
getting rid of entire department in this company?

05:31.280 --> 05:34.960
Saul,you have to stop looking at this
as if there's two different companies.

05:35.060 --> 05:38.000
We are in this precarious
situation because of the merger,

05:38.100 --> 05:40.800
and we are stuck with
these difficult decisions.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.110
-Sarah,what's--what's
wrong? -Nothing.

05:43.270 --> 05:45.550
It's just nice and
cool in here,that's all.

05:45.650 --> 05:47.200
I replaced the air conditioner.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.970
Oh,I thought we were
trying to save money.

05:49.070 --> 05:50.820
With a more energy efficient one.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.550
Look,sarah,nobody's happy about this,

05:52.650 --> 05:55.410
but we have a $20-million
loan hanging over our heads.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.310
Cuts are gonna have to
be made across the board.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.010
Why do I get the feeling
I'm about to be fired?

05:59.100 --> 06:01.050
You're not,but other
people will have to be.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.210
-Oh,that leaves me,then.
-No,not you,sarah.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.470
No,we are looking at the legal team.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.530
The legal team? You mean kevin?

06:07.580 --> 06:13.600
-No,I mean his law firm,which has been charging ojai foods an exorbitant amount of money.
-Come on. They're competitive.

06:13.670 --> 06:15.050
Holly,just a minute. You're not serious?

06:15.050 --> 06:16.790
You know what kevin has
done for this company?

06:16.890 --> 06:18.930
You can't just throw him
overboard for just a few bucks.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.420
No,no,saul,I'm not
talking about a few bucks.

06:21.540 --> 06:24.300
Now I have found a law firm that
is so much more cost-effective--

06:24.390 --> 06:26.150
are you really gonna go
along with her on this?

06:26.240 --> 06:28.350
-Do you think I want to fire my own brother?
-I don't know.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.400
Well,I don't,and if things turn
around,we can bring him back.

06:31.420 --> 06:32.130
-Yes.
-That's nice.

06:32.150 --> 06:34.630
Kevin's gonna be so happy to hear that.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.880
Are you gonna tell him?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.400
We got our earnings report today.

06:42.910 --> 06:46.170
-Did you know that you were our number one associate this month?
-No,I didn'T.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.890
All that extra work you put on the
ojai merger put you over the top.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.720
Now we were very impressed
at the partners' meeting.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.810
We're keeping our eye on you.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.030
-Thank you.
-One more thing.

06:57.980 --> 07:02.680
Cynthia and I are not using the
house in laguna beach this weekend,so.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.280
you're welcome to it.

07:07.810 --> 07:09.500
I. I don't know what to say.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.010
Feel free to invite your family.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.580
It's sort of a,uh,well,

07:13.630 --> 07:16.640
a token of our firm's appreciation.

07:18.010 --> 07:21.370
Thank you s-so much.
That's so generous.

07:21.450 --> 07:24.610
But,uh,there's-- there's
actually a lot of them.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.860
It sleeps 12.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.040
So he just gave you the keys?

07:29.140 --> 07:30.310
U know who else got these keys?

07:30.420 --> 07:32.030
Alice rogers,and she's a partner now.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.980
Yeah,and you know who else?
Joe jensen--partner now.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.480
Congratulations.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.580
-Are you gonna invite your whole family?
-What,are you crazy?

07:38.640 --> 07:40.120
-I thought it slept 12.
-Yeah,it does.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.000
But this weekend,it's gonna sleep two.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.090
I've got doug manning to see you.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.490
Bring him in.

07:45.570 --> 07:46.820
-Did you hear that?
-Do you have to go?

07:46.840 --> 07:48.610
Yeah,I do. Call you back. Bye.

07:50.550 --> 07:52.880
Mr. Manning,I am so
glad you could come by.

07:52.980 --> 07:55.840
No problem. M-my office is
just a couple of blocks away.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.260
Take a seat.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.360
I'm sure you don't remember.

07:59.470 --> 08:02.810
We did actually meet several years
ago at a conference in chicago.

08:02.910 --> 08:08.270
You were speaking with my father about a lady
you both worked with who died in a car accident.

08:08.430 --> 08:10.100
Connie lafferty.

08:10.180 --> 08:12.970
Right,because this is A.

08:13.090 --> 08:15.810
this is a picture you gave my father.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.270
Did connie have a son named ryan?

08:20.390 --> 08:21.910
Is this his picture?

08:22.000 --> 08:22.750
What's this about?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.700
I'd like to get in touch with him.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.800
I didn't keep track of connie's
family after she died. Sorry.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.309
Mr. Manning,please.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.470
I just need to get in touch with him.

08:38.919 --> 08:43.080
I heard her husband moved the
family to bakersfield after she died.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.940
Thank you.

09:02.110 --> 09:03.790
ÑÑóÑ I asked you both not to do this.

09:03.890 --> 09:06.830
Yeah,and we haven't done anything yet,which
is why we wanted to talk to you first.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.530
But we really think
the family should know.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.190
Know,know what? We don't know anything.

09:11.890 --> 09:14.070
Kevin's tracked down a phone number.

09:14.170 --> 09:15.540
This isn't hypothetical.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.050
-He's out there.
-Yeah.

09:17.650 --> 09:18.350
Where?

09:18.470 --> 09:21.280
-Bakersfield.
-Bakersfield?

09:21.300 --> 09:22.910
I know this is hard for you mom,

09:23.010 --> 09:26.130
but do we really want to wait
until there's a knock at the door?

09:26.210 --> 09:29.100
You know,I-I am not going
to be sucked into this.

09:29.180 --> 09:33.100
Things are crazy enough in this family right
now without you wanting to bring another walker--

09:33.200 --> 09:34.670
it's
not--

09:35.800 --> 09:37.200
-***
-hi.

09:37.240 --> 09:37.940
Oh,hi.

09:38.050 --> 09:39.100
What are you doing here?

09:39.190 --> 09:41.890
Oh,I'm,um,meeting sarah for lunch.

09:41.990 --> 09:45.170
-Bring another walker where?
-Bring another walker where?

09:45.250 --> 09:47.440
I don't know,sweetheart.

09:48.770 --> 09:50.340
well,then what are you talking about?

09:50.420 --> 09:51.870
We were just talking about,,

09:51.980 --> 09:53.800
uh,bringing another walker to laguna.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.350
Oh,oh,who--
who's in laguna?

09:56.470 --> 09:59.690
Uh,m-my boss has given me the keys to
his place in laguna for the weekend.

09:59.780 --> 10:03.670
Oh,well,that's nice. But why did you
come all the way over here to say that?

10:03.710 --> 10:06.230
Because we're all invited.

10:06.510 --> 10:09.270
wh--I mean,we're talking
about that as a possibility.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.640
-A possibility.
-I would love to go to laguna.

10:16.590 --> 10:17.960
Oh,I see.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.800
Robert and I are the only
ones who aren't invited,right?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.190
Oh,no,no. Everyone's invited,right,mom?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.640
Paige and coop are gonna be thrilled.

10:24.740 --> 10:28.140
oh,I don't know,mom. You know,kevin and
scotty probably want the place to themselves.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.720
-They only just got married.
-well.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.810
and they're practically newlyweds.

10:30.930 --> 10:34.220
But wait a minute. Didn't you just
drive all the way over here to invite us?

10:34.310 --> 10:35.520
Yeah.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.230
Isn't it exciting?

10:37.350 --> 10:39.520
Your brother is on the
fast track to make partner.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.570
I am so proud of you.

10:40.670 --> 10:43.410
Yeah,and speaking of which,I--
wow,I have to get back to the office.

10:43.490 --> 10:46.620
So I'll-- I'll tell scotty the
good news. Everyone's coming?

10:46.670 --> 10:47.830
-yeah.
-Yeah.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.880
Great.

10:49.460 --> 10:50.430
-Enjoy lunch.
-Bye.

10:50.510 --> 10:52.030
call tommy from the car.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.470
Oh,god,no,not tommy.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.150
well,what's wrong with tommy?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.610
-I don't even know how
to tell you this. -Sarah--

10:58.690 --> 11:00.680
no,mom,what you don't
know,what nobody knows,

11:00.800 --> 11:04.620
especially kevin,is that tommy
and holly have decided to fire him.

11:04.740 --> 11:06.090
They're gonna fire kevin?

11:06.190 --> 11:07.920
And there is nothing I can do about it.

11:08.000 --> 11:08.840
Well,just say no.

11:08.940 --> 11:11.490
Oh,I work for holly harper now,mom.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.460
Remember? You were there
when we did the deal.

11:13.490 --> 11:15.830
This is outrageous. She can't do that.

11:15.890 --> 11:17.650
Well,good luck stopping her.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.720
You don't still want
to have lunch,do you?

11:20.840 --> 11:23.400
-Yes,I still want to do lunch.
-Okay.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.000
Fine.

11:29.850 --> 11:32.150
Well,I see I no longer
have a parking spot.

11:32.180 --> 11:34.040
God,you scared me.

11:34.130 --> 11:36.240
I'm sorry. Or maybe not.

11:36.310 --> 11:37.860
What are you doing here?

11:38.180 --> 11:40.130
Oh,yes.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.590
I forgot how quickly news
spreads in your family.

11:43.710 --> 11:46.090
Well,did you think I was
just not gonna say anything?

11:46.180 --> 11:49.240
No,but I would've appreciated a call.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.960
-I'm feeling ambushed.
-Join the club.

11:51.980 --> 11:55.410
Nora,saving a business
requires sacrifice.

11:55.530 --> 12:00.470
-Now you asked me to step in-- to keep
ojai in the family,not to fire my son.

12:00.570 --> 12:02.360
We're only acting responsibly.

12:02.460 --> 12:06.420
Well,I wonder if you would be acting
this responsibly if it were about rebecca.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.780
You know,if this involved rebecca,I hope
that I would do exactly the same thing.

12:10.890 --> 12:15.270
Well,that certainly explains why
she isn't talking to you anymore.

12:15.390 --> 12:18.450
You know,I am trying
to be patient right now.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.540
But you are making it very hard.

12:20.660 --> 12:21.400
I'm making that hard?

12:21.510 --> 12:24.920
You know,nora,this is
really tommy's call.

12:25.020 --> 12:27.150
I thought you were the C.E.O.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.690
Fine.

12:28.780 --> 12:32.720
Then as the C.E.O.,Let me
make this perfectly clear.

12:32.800 --> 12:37.670
This is a business decision,which is very
fitting since ojai foods is a business.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.820
This is no longer william's company.

12:39.920 --> 12:43.450
So you don't have the right to
barge in here and make demands.

12:43.540 --> 12:45.720
If you have something
that you need to say,

12:45.820 --> 12:47.610
then pick up the
phone,make an appointment,

12:47.690 --> 12:51.250
park in the visitor's parking lot and
hike on up here just like everybody else.

12:51.330 --> 12:58.020
Now I know this is hard for someone like
you to stomach,but the family circus is over.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.120
I swear,holly thinks
she's running U.S. Steel.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.260
She keeps coming up with these
ridiculous organizational charts,

13:07.330 --> 13:12.450
and every day,my square gets
smaller and smaller and smaller.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.350
Do me a favor.

13:13.430 --> 13:17.640
Just tell me what it's like to have a great job
and a gorgeous husband and a ranch in santa barbara.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.600
Don't leave any details out.

13:19.700 --> 13:23.280
Okay,if you promise to tell me what
it's like to have two beautiful kids.

13:23.380 --> 13:24.710
Oh,gosh. I wouldn't know.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.920
My angels have recently morphed
into these little monsters.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.800
I swear. I'm very close to just driving a little
woon stake through both their little hearts.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.170
well,so much for unconditional love.

13:37.940 --> 13:39.890
You don't remember?

13:40.140 --> 13:44.470
First I gush it out on
everyone like--like a fountain,

13:44.580 --> 13:48.900
and then I use it to
glue people together.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.470
Too maudlin?

13:51.740 --> 13:54.950
Well,it--you know,it just
didn't sound like you.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.050
I think I got a little carried away.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.020
I'm sorry it took me so
long. Are you mad at me?

14:00.350 --> 14:02.960
Oh,god! And the other thing--
we're cost cutti at work,

14:02.960 --> 14:06.970
but holly installs a brand-new air
conditioning unit in her office.

14:07.060 --> 14:10.330
Now it is sucking the life
out of everybody else'S.

14:10.430 --> 14:13.430
Rebecca,give me. all your 7s.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.320
Ooh,go fish.

14:15.430 --> 14:16.810
Oh,crap.

14:16.910 --> 14:18.230
Paige,what did you say?

14:18.310 --> 14:20.330
Mom says it all the time.

14:20.590 --> 14:21.790
I don't want to play anymore.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.710
No,that's not fair. I'm winning.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.450
That's so not fair.
You're just a sore loser.

14:25.450 --> 14:26.130
You're the loser.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.930
Okay,okay,I think that it's time to
go upstairs and get your homework done.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.160
Oh,crap. Oh,crap. Oh,crap.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.830
What's going on in here?

14:33.920 --> 14:34.640
Cooper said "crap.

14:34.760 --> 14:38.880
" Yeah,I heard him,and I also heard rebecca tell
you guys to go upstairs and do your homework.

14:38.960 --> 14:39.800
I don't have any homework.

14:39.890 --> 14:47.280
Paige,do you realize that your uncle justin invented the
"I don't have any homework" dodge. before you were born?

14:47.290 --> 14:51.130
So why don't we march our cute little butts
upstairs and do some homework,all right?

14:51.230 --> 14:52.210
homework!

14:52.310 --> 14:53.040
Homework!

14:53.160 --> 14:53.850
Homework!

14:53.940 --> 14:54.810
Homerk!

14:54.930 --> 14:55.810
Homework!

14:55.930 --> 14:56.720
Homework!

14:56.830 --> 14:57.660
Homework!

14:57.770 --> 14:59.110
Home--
hey.

15:00.810 --> 15:02.550
We really need to get better this.

15:02.650 --> 15:05.200
-What,this?
-No,the hiding it part.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.360
We don't have to hide anything.
We're not doing anything wrong.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.190
Look,I just--I don't want to announce anything yet ada
malo. Because,you know,we're not even sure what we are--

15:11.230 --> 15:13.280
you want to spend the whole
weekend in laguna pretending?

15:13.380 --> 15:17.570
Unless you want your family watching us
the whole time to see what's going on.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.100
Mm,okay.

15:22.070 --> 15:24.450
uncle justin?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.100
Oh,crap.

15:33.110 --> 15:35.760
Okay,so I go to make a pitcher
of martinis,and I look in the bar,

15:35.860 --> 15:40.470
and i find about 20 "up" glasses,and
all of them are baccarat crystal.

15:40.550 --> 15:41.280
They're gorgeous.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.300
Yeah,well,put 'em all back. 'Cause this
is my family,so they can use paper cups.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.840
-Where were you?
-Bathroom number five.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.430
My goal for the weekend
is to pee in all eight.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.030
Well,then you better drink up.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.500
-Why is this pink? -It's
pomegranate-- full of antioxidants.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.820
No,no,no,no. I like my family oxidized.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.900
And you know what gets
pomegranate juice stains out?

15:59.020 --> 16:00.360
Absolutely nothing,okay?

16:00.470 --> 16:03.880
Clear liquids from now
on--g,vodka and consomm? Cheers.

16:06.350 --> 16:08.770
okay,time to move everything
my family could ruin.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.710
Like our romantic vacation for two?

16:10.830 --> 16:13.080
Look,I am so sorry,okay?
I just panicked.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.890
No,it's okay. I'd freak out,too,if I had
random new siblings springing up all the time.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.400
Please remember you're
not supposed to know,okay?

16:18.520 --> 16:21.170
Mom's head would explode. And
don't ask kitty about the adoption.

16:21.230 --> 16:25.280
She's really stressed out about it,and please
don't mention to sarah me making partner.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.340
I don't think we should rub her nose in it
now that her career is circling the drain.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.780
Wow,this fish is really heavy.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.730
Yeah,that fish is a whale,and
it cost more than your car.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.610
Really?

16:36.090 --> 16:37.760
Now I hate my car.

16:37.870 --> 16:39.020
You know what? I'm glad we're hosting.

16:39.110 --> 16:42.520
It's the least we can do after
everything your family's done for us.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.300
You're so much nicer than I am.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.420
You know what? When I make partner,I'm
gonna buy you two whales-- moby and dick.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.620
-you had a head start.
-That's not fair.

16:51.630 --> 16:52.750
Cooper. Coop.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.300
hey,kids. You ready to have fun?

16:55.310 --> 16:56.200
Hey,can we go outside?

16:56.300 --> 16:57.450
Of course. Check out the pool.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.230
-be careful!
-oh,I got an eye on 'em.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.250
Everyone's right behind me. It was
like a motorcade coming down here.

17:02.270 --> 17:04.210
-This place is obscene.
-Right?

17:04.230 --> 17:06.859
I'm so sorry you got roped
into having the whole family.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.589
You know what? I've decided
this is gonna be great.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.160
I mean,come on. Look at this place.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.190
You're right.

17:11.609 --> 17:12.650
You.

17:12.810 --> 17:15.700
let's enjoy ourselves.
You gonna give me the tour?

17:15.990 --> 17:17.410
It's okay. You can leave 'em there.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.410
With a good wind behind
it,this place could take off.

17:20.530 --> 17:23.020
-Mommy,can I have some soda?
-No,absolutely not.

17:23.069 --> 17:24.369
You're jacked up enough as it is.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.190
You can have grape juice with water.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.830
-Uh,how about just water?
-I hate water.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.770
Hey,you guys,we're here.

17:30.780 --> 17:31.980
How are you?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.510
Well,I didn't expect to see you here.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.880
Why not? We were invited.

17:39.910 --> 17:41.560
Well,it should be interesting.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.850
When are you gonna tell him?

17:44.230 --> 17:47.210
Hey,kev,this-- this
place is incredible,man.

17:47.310 --> 17:50.950
The life of a partner,and since
ojai's a big reason I may become one,

17:51.050 --> 17:52.480
you get the master bedroom.

17:52.580 --> 17:54.530
Come on. You know,you
don't have to do that.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.070
Yo,this place freakin' rocks.

17:57.170 --> 17:57.860
Jeez.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.160
You guys carpool?

17:59.290 --> 18:00.730
Us? No,no. I-I drove alone.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.370
Oh,I came with mom.

18:01.390 --> 18:03.450
I can't believe it. Tommy's here.

18:03.490 --> 18:05.890
Just keep smiling. Let's not
ruin the weekend before it starts.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.540
Don't worry. I'm gonna talk to him.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.950
He just has to learn to
stand up to that woman.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.890
-Hi,everyone!
-Hi,mom.

18:11.910 --> 18:15.190
Oh,my gosh! Look at this. It's amazing.

18:15.740 --> 18:16.880
-Uncle justin.
-Yeah.

18:16.920 --> 18:17.920
Can you get coop a soda?

18:18.040 --> 18:19.360
Uh,is it okay with your mom?

18:19.490 --> 18:24.640
Of course not,but you don't want anybody
to find out about you and rebecca,do you?

18:24.650 --> 18:26.880
this is blackmail.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.980
You promise to keep your mouth shut?

18:33.860 --> 18:36.020
All right,here,you little monster.

18:36.030 --> 18:37.610
It's diet.

18:38.140 --> 18:39.280
So?

18:39.400 --> 18:40.530
-uncle justin.
-Yeah?

18:40.600 --> 18:42.300
-These don't work.
-All right,let me see 'em.

18:42.310 --> 18:45.950
The screen went dark,and it just
said "video 6. " Can you fix it?

18:45.970 --> 18:48.000
Uh,yeah,yeah. You know what?
I'll,uh,I'll fix it later.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.830
No,I want to watch "hannah montana" now.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.350
fine. I'll see what I can do.

18:53.380 --> 18:56.020
I can't believe kevin gave us this room.

18:56.140 --> 19:00.240
I'm gonna spend the entire weekend going back
and forth between the pool and the hot tub.

19:00.330 --> 19:01.680
Yeah.

19:02.170 --> 19:03.870
Tommy,what is it?

19:03.990 --> 19:06.920
It's too beautiful of a day
for you to be in a bad mood.

19:07.010 --> 19:07.720
What? Nothing.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.280
Look,I just-- I have some work
stuff on my mind,all right?

19:10.380 --> 19:15.110
I know,but can't you just
forgeabout the business for a minute?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.110
Sorry to interrupt.

19:22.450 --> 19:24.140
I-I left elizabeth with scotty.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.930
I-I think she's
getting a little hungry.

19:26.010 --> 19:29.330
Oh,okay. Uh,I'll get her. Thanks.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.060
Look at that view.

19:33.150 --> 19:35.650
Yeah,smooth move,mom. Let me guess.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.000
You talked to sarah.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.620
Tommy,I know how hard
you're trying with ojai.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.420
I don't blame you for any of this,

19:41.500 --> 19:45.020
but you can't fire kevin just
because holly wants you to.

19:45.090 --> 19:46.070
You have to learn to push back with her.

19:46.150 --> 19:49.550
Mom-- if you and sarah stand
together,there's nothing she can do.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.620
You don't understand.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.070
This was my idea.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.320
-Your idea?
-Yeah.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.200
Holly just agreed with me.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.150
If you look at the
books,we can't afford him.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.080
I am doing this to save the company,mom.

20:05.180 --> 20:06.330
You can'T. You can'T.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.560
You see how proud he
is out there. You can'T.

20:08.610 --> 20:10.180
Do you think I want to do this?

20:10.270 --> 20:13.600
Tommy,he's your brother.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.350
I know.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:27.570 --> 20:28.910
Here you are.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.910
I'm thinking of heading down the
hills to the beach. You want to come?

20:30.920 --> 20:34.080
What,and leave my family
unchaperoned? I don't think so.

20:34.090 --> 20:38.840
You know,kitty and sarah have already started
throwing back your pomegranate martinis.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.190
-You love it.
-Love what?

20:41.190 --> 20:43.500
All of them being here,hosted by you,

20:43.600 --> 20:48.200
Mr. "I've got the keys to a fabulous beach
house, soon-to-be partner of a major L.A.Law firm.

20:48.210 --> 20:49.500
" You forgot just married.

20:49.620 --> 20:50.770
Oh,right. That little detail.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.270
You know what? I think I do.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.620
I think I love being lord of the manner.

20:55.740 --> 20:59.940
Mm,that's 'cause you like being the center of
attention,like everybody else in your family.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.130
Yeah. Actually,it's amazing none
of us went into show business.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.000
Well,you've been working
like a crazy person.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.510
You deserve to be the
center of attention.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.770
don't go to the beach just yet.

21:11.910 --> 21:13.860
Why? What do you have in mind?

21:15.710 --> 21:18.280
Kevin,your family's here.
What if they spill something?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.390
I've already taken care of that.

21:21.330 --> 21:24.880
-Kevin's making me drink outside.
-me,too.

21:25.910 --> 21:31.000
Oh,god. You know,it's really
actually quite beautiful out here.

21:32.430 --> 21:36.400
You know,sarah,I know I've
been really weird about it,but.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.640
-your letter meant a lot to me.
-Oh,don't worry about it.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.220
No,really. You said some.

21:41.540 --> 21:44.200
very nice things,and. and I.

21:44.350 --> 21:47.350
I loved that story about
me in the third grade.

21:48.550 --> 21:49.180
that one.

21:49.260 --> 21:54.330
Yeah,the one where I used to give the cookies to the little
girl because her mother only gave her apples for dessert.

21:54.370 --> 21:55.810
yeaH. I just.

21:55.950 --> 21:58.580
I thought it epitomized you.

22:01.290 --> 22:02.580
saraH.

22:03.860 --> 22:07.570
That story was never in the
letter. It never even happened.

22:07.630 --> 22:10.710
God. I should've known. You would
never give your cookies away to anyone.

22:10.710 --> 22:11.910
It's not funny.

22:11.990 --> 22:14.000
Oh,god. Why didn't I
finish reading that letter?

22:14.090 --> 22:15.060
You didn't even read it?

22:15.160 --> 22:16.890
No,I did,most of it.

22:17.010 --> 22:18.740
God,I almost even wrote it.

22:18.820 --> 22:21.630
I ran out of timE. I was talking to mom.

22:22.470 --> 22:24.760
Oh,of course,mom. Mom wrote it.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.720
She offered to help.

22:25.860 --> 22:28.260
You didn't have to say yes.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.170
I mean,come on,sarah,what's
going on with you?

22:30.290 --> 22:31.610
You had,like,a month to write it.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.060
Sorry,kitty. I'm just--
I'm at the end of my rope.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.810
I have never been this stressed.

22:35.940 --> 22:39.370
I'm about to do the biggest thing I've ever
done in my life,and I asked you to help me.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.030
God,what are you even worried about?

22:41.190 --> 22:43.490
You're married to a senator.
You are gonna get a baby.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.590
You know what? You always do this.

22:44.650 --> 22:48.450
You always,always make the
assumption that my life is so easy.

22:48.550 --> 22:50.920
You know,I think it's because
you're so obsessed with your own life

22:51.020 --> 22:53.960
that the only thing that you can
see in mine is what you don't have.

22:54.060 --> 22:55.250
That is not fair.

22:55.370 --> 22:56.760
You don't even know
what's been going on.

22:56.870 --> 22:59.570
-Then why don't you tell me?
-I can'T.

22:59.980 --> 23:02.660
oh,god. I shouldn'T.

23:03.120 --> 23:07.500
Okay,it's about dad. Kevin
found out some things.

23:08.330 --> 23:09.100
You remember the photo?

23:09.220 --> 23:10.680
-Oh,god,please,not again.
-I know you think I'm crazy.

23:10.710 --> 23:11.840
-I'm not.
-It's true.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.620
-No,seriously-- dad
had another child.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.620
Mom doesn't want anyone to know.
Otherwise,we would've told you.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.960
Speak to kevin.

23:19.220 --> 23:21.150
We have a phone number.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.020
His name is ryan lafferty.

23:25.940 --> 23:27.530
Oh,god.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.420
Oh,my god. Paige,cooper,are you okay?

23:33.370 --> 23:35.670
I left you alone for five
minutes. What happened?

23:35.750 --> 23:36.980
I wanted to get the whale.

23:37.090 --> 23:39.280
Oh,this is bad. This
is-- this is really bad.

23:39.340 --> 23:40.930
Oh,my god. What happened?

23:46.210 --> 23:47.800
Oh,my god.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.640
Oh,my god.

23:51.090 --> 23:51.920
The whale.

23:52.020 --> 23:54.300
Look at the whale. I'm a dead man.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.990
I'm a dead man. Who did this?

23:58.680 --> 24:00.600
Who did this?

24:00.920 --> 24:03.720
I did,kevin.
I'm--I'm sorry.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.210
You know,when I was a kid,I
made a ton of model airplanes.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.080
So this is gonna be as good as new.

24:10.200 --> 24:10.880
Thanks.

24:10.980 --> 24:13.070
Maybe when you're done.
You could repair my career.

24:13.140 --> 24:15.370
It'll be all right,honey. We're
gonna get this all cleaned up.

24:15.400 --> 24:18.570
Mom,please,don't even
try. I'm inconsolable.

24:18.570 --> 24:21.680
Tommy,don't let the kids come in
here. They'll step on the glass.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.350
It's okay,mom. They're
with scotty and julia.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.660
You know,I still don't understand
what you were doing in here,justin.

24:25.780 --> 24:27.940
I'm sorry,okay. Jeez,drop it,kevin.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.800
Kitty,we could use some help over here.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.700
-I'm not even talking to you.
-What did I do?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.410
Oh,don't play dumb,mother.

24:33.530 --> 24:36.830
You wrote sarah's
letter of recommendation.

24:36.950 --> 24:39.190
-You told her?
-She figured it out,mom.

24:39.230 --> 24:40.620
-You were right.
-Yeah.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.800
Yeah,apparently there are certain
members of this family who are--

24:43.890 --> 24:47.770
are keeping all kinds of secrets.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.930
-Sarah.
-what exactly did you tell her?

24:50.970 --> 24:52.230
Does this concern
me and-- justin.

24:52.330 --> 24:54.890
Yes,yes,justin,this concerns all of us.

24:54.990 --> 24:59.570
I've just been informed that dad
does have another child out there.

24:59.650 --> 25:03.230
Oh,you know what? If this is another one
of sarah's crazy ideas,I'm not listening.

25:03.290 --> 25:05.550
I'm not crazy. Kevin,can
you please tell them?

25:05.610 --> 25:06.390
No.

25:06.480 --> 25:10.160
A couple of days ago,I met
up with an old friend of dad's

25:10.250 --> 25:13.370
the photo we found is
of a boy named ryan.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.720
Dad was very close to his mother.

25:14.830 --> 25:17.080
-Well,that's hardly concrete evidence.
-I know.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.330
We could call him.

25:19.450 --> 25:21.480
-Kevin has his number.
-You have his number?

25:21.510 --> 25:23.070
No one is calling anyone.

25:23.170 --> 25:26.030
-Mom,the cat is out of the bag.
-Put it back in.

25:26.050 --> 25:27.130
Mom,are--are
you okay?

25:27.230 --> 25:28.980
I'm fine,I'm fine,I'm fine.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.050
Believe me,nothing your father has
done will surprise me ever again.

25:32.170 --> 25:34.540
I just don't think there's
any value in pursuing this.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.390
well,I'm sorry,but I disagree.

25:36.490 --> 25:39.090
What do you think will happen
if we actually find this guy?

25:39.170 --> 25:40.740
I mean,we got lucky with rebecca.

25:40.820 --> 25:42.410
We don't know anything about him.

25:42.490 --> 25:46.070
yeah,I agree. Even with rebecca,it
was a little touchy in the beginning.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.330
-Tommy.
-I'm right here,you know?

25:47.350 --> 25:49.480
Can't just sweep this
back under the rug.

25:49.570 --> 25:51.750
It's just better if
everything is out in the open.

25:51.830 --> 25:53.440
Yeah. Rebecca and i have started dating.

25:53.450 --> 25:55.680
-Justin.
-Justin,not now,sweetheart.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.740
Yeah,we kind of assumed that anyway.

25:56.820 --> 25:58.060
I didn't assume anything.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.830
You know what? While we're telling the
truth,I didn't break this damn whale,okay?

26:00.830 --> 26:02.490
-Cooper did.
-Who cares?

26:02.490 --> 26:03.380
I care.

26:03.510 --> 26:07.560
Okay,justin and rebecca,doesn't it
feel better now that everybody knows?

26:07.670 --> 26:09.030
Sarah,thiis different.

26:09.130 --> 26:11.810
-How?
-Ryan is a very loaded situation.

26:11.810 --> 26:15.750
We can't just go cold-calling potential
family members because we're curious.

26:15.850 --> 26:18.310
I'm not curious,mom.
This is about the truth.

26:18.390 --> 26:21.670
We owe this ryan the truth.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.730
Why are you so worried
about what we owe him?

26:23.820 --> 26:27.060
yeah,really. Look,sarah,ojai's
having enough trouble right now.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.680
We don't need another person
trying to make a claim to--

26:29.780 --> 26:31.610
a claim?Oh,my god. I'm going for a walk.

26:31.610 --> 26:32.480
Wait. Rebecca,wait. I'll come with you.

26:32.490 --> 26:33.040
No,stay here.

26:33.130 --> 26:33.870
-You're unbelievable.
-what?

26:34.110 --> 26:35.780
Not everything is about money,tommy.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.730
No,no,of course not,sarah,because
it's all about you.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.920
Why don't you try being
a sister to me first

26:41.020 --> 26:43.190
before you start dragging
somebody else into the mix?

26:43.300 --> 26:46.260
-I have done--
stop,stop,stop.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.630
You see? This is why I
didn't want everyone to know.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.660
Look what's happening. We're
just talking about the guy.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.640
-Mom,our problems started way before ryan came along.
-Right.

26:53.670 --> 26:56.050
I mean,tommy's plans have
nothing to do with ryan.

26:56.170 --> 26:57.710
-Sarah,don'T.
-No,I'm done.

26:57.740 --> 27:00.470
-I am done. Keeping the family secrets.
-sarah,do not say anything.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.350
Sarah. sarah.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.870
I'm sorry. He's letting you go,kevin.

27:03.890 --> 27:04.430
-oh,sarah.
-what?

27:04.490 --> 27:07.160
Holly and tommy have decided
that you're expendable.

27:07.370 --> 27:08.980
-oh,sarah!
-what?

27:09.530 --> 27:12.140
-We're making cuts at ojai.
-yeah.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.050
Restructuring.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.500
Oh,my god.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.700
If you knew how important
that account was.

27:22.890 --> 27:24.500
kevin.

27:24.700 --> 27:27.010
-you know,mom,forget about the mess.
-kevin.

27:29.640 --> 27:33.130
Sarah,you are like a dog with a bone.

27:33.530 --> 27:35.160
You guys make politics look tame.

27:35.230 --> 27:37.450
Yeah,you know what? Let's go.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.450
Look,I wanted you to hear it from me.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.750
Yeah,that would've been nice.

28:08.990 --> 28:12.860
Ojai is having a cash
problem,obviously,and.

28:12.950 --> 28:14.680
-and now that's my problem.
-You mean I'm your problem.

28:14.720 --> 28:16.870
No,it's the business.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.100
Dad did whatever he had
to do to make it a success.

28:21.190 --> 28:22.920
Now I didn't always
understand his choices--

28:23.010 --> 28:24.320
yeah,you're right.He was an enigma.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.190
You're not listening to me.

28:26.290 --> 28:30.760
He knew that without a healthy,profitable
company,none of us would feel secure.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.200
Now I'm sorry. I know
this feels cd and ruthless.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.770
But I'm doing this
for the right reasons.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.760
I'm doing this for the family.

28:38.920 --> 28:45.160
Tommy,did it ever occur to you that dad
wanted me to be a part of this business,

28:45.290 --> 28:48.110
that he did that for a reason?

28:48.230 --> 28:53.100
You can go on about him all you want,but
this is not what he would've wanted.

28:54.670 --> 28:56.460
Kevin.

28:56.660 --> 29:00.130
you're my brother,and I love
you,but this has to be done.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.920
And I'm sorry,really. I'm--I'm
not trying to hurt you.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.230
Tommy.

29:05.430 --> 29:07.950
if you want to draw a
line in the sand,please do,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.030
and put me on one side
and stand on the other.

29:11.110 --> 29:16.170
But if you do,there is absolutely
no going back from that.

29:16.210 --> 29:17.700
Kevin--
no.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.020
Kev--
no.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.750
C--
what?

29:24.210 --> 29:26.100
Justin,I asked you not to say anythinG.

29:26.250 --> 29:27.800
I know my family,okay?

29:27.960 --> 29:30.350
And I knew it'd go over a lot
better if they were distracted--

29:30.450 --> 29:32.190
go over better?

29:33.830 --> 29:35.090
Becca,why are you so upset?

29:35.210 --> 29:39.300
Because,justin,now that
they know,everything changes.

29:39.380 --> 29:42.620
I mean,have you ever honestly thought about
what's gonna happen to me if we break up?

29:42.710 --> 29:45.210
You'll be fine,and I-I will be the
ex-girlfriend that everyone wishes

29:45.320 --> 29:47.320
would just be polite
and--and disappear.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.980
Look,that is so not true. Okay?

29:49.240 --> 29:51.010
Everybody in that house loves you.

29:51.110 --> 29:54.160
No,they are completely wrapped up in
how to deal with my replacement. What?

29:54.250 --> 29:59.130
And honestly,it's not like there's enough room
at the table for ex-girlfriends and ex-sisters.

29:59.370 --> 30:00.220
Rebecca,where are you going?

30:00.380 --> 30:02.270
I just--you know
what? I gotta go home.

30:02.310 --> 30:04.600
I don't want to be here anymore.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.460
oh,uh,is kitty still up?

30:19.260 --> 30:22.380
You know,she's had a pretty tough day.

30:22.540 --> 30:24.330
I think maybe you ought
to talk to her tomorrow.

30:24.420 --> 30:26.660
She's that furious?

30:26.760 --> 30:28.830
She's that hurt.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.860
Right. I really want to fix this up.

30:33.950 --> 30:36.790
I mean,she's my sister.
I love her,obviously.

30:36.790 --> 30:41.440
Nobody can slide the knife between the
ribs quite like the people who love us.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.870
Yeah.

30:44.250 --> 30:47.450
You're not gonna let me
off the hook here,are you?

30:47.530 --> 30:50.070
Is that what you came for?

30:50.840 --> 30:54.310
Look,come by tomorrow. I'm
sure she'll be more receptive.

30:56.610 --> 30:58.800
-Good night.
-Night.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.710
Yo,can you pass the sports section,kev?

31:05.740 --> 31:08.740
-Scotty,the frittata is wonderful.
-Oh,thank you.

31:10.530 --> 31:12.010
take your time.

31:12.220 --> 31:13.800
-It's white bean and rosemary?
-Yes,yeah.

31:13.860 --> 31:15.290
-It's really lovely.
-Thank you.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.160
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.780
good morning.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.090
Okay.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.190
Um,is kitty up yet?

31:26.290 --> 31:28.840
-They left early this morning.
-Oh,damn.

31:29.510 --> 31:30.930
I guess I'll have to talk to her later.

31:31.030 --> 31:32.970
Mom,I think we're just
gonna pack up and--

31:33.090 --> 31:34.260
hey,you know what?Can
I bum a ride with you?

31:34.320 --> 31:36.120
-Sure. Where's rebecca?
-She left last night.

31:36.180 --> 31:37.770
Yeah,tommy and julia
left last night,too.

31:37.890 --> 31:40.120
We're like rats
deserting a sinking ship.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.000
Hey,sarah,can I get
you any,um,breakfast?

31:42.050 --> 31:44.240
No,thanks,scotty. I
just lost my appetite.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.560
Sarah,scotty made a delicious frittata.

31:46.660 --> 31:49.400
At least you can sit
down and have a few bites.

31:49.610 --> 31:51.790
-Okay,mother. I shall stay for breakfast.
-Good.

31:52.470 --> 31:53.690
Great.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.400
Okay,kevin. I am so
sorry about the shelf.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.250
-Of course I will pay for anything that broke.
-Don't worry about it.

32:05.330 --> 32:10.180
And before I do any more damage, I'd just like to
say that I've been thinking a lot about everything,

32:10.210 --> 32:14.910
and I realize that perhaps I am not the best
person to decide about what we do about ryan.

32:15.010 --> 32:16.380
-Well,that's big of you.
-Oh,give me a break.

32:16.420 --> 32:19.340
I'm done with trying to
convince anybody to do anything.

32:19.440 --> 32:23.100
You're the head of this family.
I think you should decide.

32:23.130 --> 32:26.540
It would've been nice if you'd
come to that conclusion yesterday.

32:30.110 --> 32:31.960
yeah.

32:45.860 --> 32:48.520
-You need some help?
-Nah.

32:48.720 --> 32:52.250
It's my first apartment. I
should probably do it by myself.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.420
rebecca,look,about last night.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

33:01.450 --> 33:05.530
I mean,god,you've lost so much in this last
month, I mean,your mom and--and david,and.

33:07.670 --> 33:11.040
I should've been more sensitive
to what you were feeling.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.610
I'm just scared.

33:18.550 --> 33:21.740
if I lose you and your
family,what do I have left?

33:22.320 --> 33:26.030
Look,you-- you're not the
only one who's scared,though.

33:27.650 --> 33:29.990
Rebecca,you're my best
friend in this world.

33:30.090 --> 33:32.910
Do you think I want to risk losing that?

33:33.470 --> 33:35.620
Justin.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.560
the thing is,I think we have to.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.040
Risk it,I mean.

33:42.180 --> 33:46.220
Maybe we should stop wasting time
worrying about how it might end.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.520
because maybe.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.710
you know,maybe. maybe it won't end.

33:53.900 --> 33:56.000
Can we start over.

33:56.990 --> 33:59.680
without all the pressure?

34:03.630 --> 34:07.390
there's a roller right behind
you. We could start with that.

34:10.870 --> 34:12.570
okay.

34:19.300 --> 34:23.239
so is this a bad time to tell you that
this is the worst color on the planet?

34:23.360 --> 34:25.170
-Justin!
-What?

34:35.489 --> 34:38.400
well,that was a quick trip.
I don't even have any laundry.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.699
I think your family's got enough
dirty laundry for all of us.

34:42.739 --> 34:45.639
-is that her?
-She's worse than my mother when she wants to talk.

34:45.690 --> 34:47.750
You're gonna have to
talk to her eventually.

34:48.290 --> 34:50.550
-Why?
-Because she's not gonna stop until you do,and.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.120
you love her.

34:54.040 --> 34:54.810
Oh,okay.

34:55.710 --> 34:56.429
Too late.

34:56.540 --> 34:58.630
Look,she was sorry when she
came to talk to you last night.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.640
-Oh,robert,I know. You keep on telling me that.
-I don't understand.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.240
Out of all of the horrible things
I've seen your family do to each other,

35:03.350 --> 35:05.670
-what about this is so terrible?
-It's notust about the letter.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.860
Sarah has a completely
unrealistic view of my life.

35:08.960 --> 35:09.880
She always has.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.810
She thinks that everything comes so
easily to me,and that is not how it is.

35:13.930 --> 35:15.200
I have struggled in my career.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.290
It took me forever
to meet you--

35:17.390 --> 35:21.010
ah,but it was worth the wait,wasn't it?

35:21.090 --> 35:22.140
Robert,I'm serious.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.430
How can I rely on sarah to help me if she
doesn't even know that I have any problems?

35:25.520 --> 35:27.030
She probably doesn'T.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.600
I mean,you put on a very brave face.

35:28.690 --> 35:30.600
Well,so what? She's my sister.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.050
She's supposed to
know me better--

35:32.130 --> 35:34.310
and by the way,who are you defending? Because
it doesn't sound like you're defending me.

35:34.400 --> 35:39.260
I'm not defending anyone. I'm just saying that if you think
this is part of a larger problem,you should say something.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.580
Okay,but when do you get to the point
where you stop expecting somebody to change?

35:45.520 --> 35:48.760
Do you really think
you and sarah are there?

35:50.750 --> 35:53.470
I don't know.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.130
How much damage was there?

35:56.220 --> 36:01.310
Uh,some--some pottery,a ceramic
bowl and two glass vases.

36:01.420 --> 36:04.430
They were la marina vases.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.900
I didn't know that.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.790
Anything else?

36:07.990 --> 36:10.650
-A whale.
-The whale?

36:11.870 --> 36:13.380
Yeah.

36:15.450 --> 36:18.320
There is one other thing.

36:18.870 --> 36:21.790
-We lost ojai as a client.
-How?

36:22.460 --> 36:24.780
My--my brother
fired us.

36:24.930 --> 36:28.040
They're in a financial bind.
They're trying to save money.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.350
You had a hell of a weekend,didn't you?

36:30.470 --> 36:32.620
Yes,sir,I did.

36:34.790 --> 36:36.580
Well.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.240
-you better get back to work.
-Yes,sir.

36:39.690 --> 36:40.670
The.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.390
keys.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.090
Your brother tommy's on the line.

37:03.190 --> 37:05.670
He's called about four times now.

37:05.790 --> 37:06.920
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

37:07.000 --> 37:07.790
-Are you sure?
-Yep.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.240
Okay. No problem.

37:23.910 --> 37:25.390
Nora?

37:26.230 --> 37:28.830
Don't worry. I parked
in the visitor's lot.

37:28.890 --> 37:32.490
Yes,but you didn't make an
appointment,so I-if you'll excuse me.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.760
No,I won't excuse you.

37:34.890 --> 37:36.820
I've been excusing you
for months and months,

37:36.900 --> 37:38.490
giving you the benefit
of the doubt,when really,

37:38.610 --> 37:40.180
I should've known
that nothing--

37:40.300 --> 37:45.150
nothing you have done since you first met william
has been in the best interest of my family or me.

37:45.250 --> 37:50.450
Nora,you live in a dream world where no one
gets hurt and everyone gets what they want.

37:50.540 --> 37:53.900
Well,I do expect when I make a
deal with someone,they stick to it.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.860
Oh,well,then maybe you
should've read the fine print,

37:56.960 --> 37:58.820
because I don't owe you anything.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.050
You promised you would not
micromanage this company,

38:01.140 --> 38:03.120
that you would let
sarah and tommy run it.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.940
Instead,you have put yourself
in a position to hurt kevin.

38:06.020 --> 38:08.160
I told you,talk to tommy about that.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.460
And you've poisoned tommy.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.820
You have never stopped relishing
in trying to humiliate me.

38:13.940 --> 38:18.100
Well,right now,you're doing a pretty
good job of embarrassing yourself.

38:19.730 --> 38:23.190
I wasn't really sure I was
gonna tell you this,but.

38:23.310 --> 38:24.970
I realize,my whole
family knows about it.

38:25.050 --> 38:28.820
It's really only a matter
of time until you find out,

38:28.930 --> 38:31.340
and I want to be here when you do.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.320
Find out about what?

38:34.440 --> 38:41.160
Oh,holly,it must feel so good sitting here and
looking around at what was once william's world.

38:41.250 --> 38:43.990
But you don't know the half of it.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.310
He had another lover.

38:47.420 --> 38:50.310
And they had a child together.

38:50.950 --> 38:54.450
a boy. ryan.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.180
I don't believe you.

38:58.380 --> 39:01.060
Yes,you do.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.520
-hi.
-Sarah.

39:14.580 --> 39:17.840
I know you have a party. When I saw all the
cars,I almost turned around and went home,

39:17.860 --> 39:20.390
but I wanted you to get this in time.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.170
Here.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.610
That's really sweet of you.

39:25.760 --> 39:29.440
But I've already sent all
the materials to the agency.

39:31.170 --> 39:33.280
Well,then give me the
address. I'll overnight iT.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.470
Honestly,you have to
include this in your packet.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.990
After I wrote it,I wanted
to give you my kids.

39:39.090 --> 39:42.030
They're really strict
about deadlines and.

39:42.230 --> 39:43.980
I don't want to ask for
any special treatment.

39:44.100 --> 39:47.240
Listen,kitty,I want to fix this.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.950
I want you to know how sorry I am,

39:50.110 --> 39:53.870
how much you mean to
me,before another day goes by.

39:54.370 --> 39:56.600
Sarah,I already know that.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.250
I mean,you're my sister.

39:58.390 --> 39:59.810
We love each other unconditionally,

39:59.920 --> 40:05.010
just like mom's overflowing
fountain and her magical glue,

40:06.330 --> 40:08.420
but that's not the problem between us.

40:08.510 --> 40:10.200
kitty.

40:10.310 --> 40:13.150
Then what is the problem?

40:13.400 --> 40:17.200
-Can we talk about this tomorrow?
-No,tell me now.

40:18.470 --> 40:20.340
It's trust.

40:21.270 --> 40:24.000
The problem between us is trust.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.460
kit--
sweetie,who is it?

40:25.630 --> 40:27.460
Oh--
go,go. Go.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.680
"dear birth mother,"I'm sarah walker.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.450
"Kitty walker mccallister is my sister.

40:47.210 --> 40:50.880
"There is nobody who would
make a better mother than kitty,

40:50.980 --> 40:57.020
"not just because of who she is but
because of who she wants threst of us to be.

40:57.860 --> 41:00.980
"  "she has so much hope
for the people she loves,

41:01.090 --> 41:05.270
"even when the road we're
on turns steep and uncertain.

41:05.370 --> 41:08.870
"No one I know understands
family more than she does--

41:08.960 --> 41:10.360
"that we're here to help each other,

41:10.410 --> 41:15.360
"and that part of that "means we
must be patient with our differences.

41:15.920 --> 41:21.440
"She also knows that it's only by giving
"that we gain the things that truly matter.

41:22.380 --> 41:23.400
"It's funny.

41:23.520 --> 41:27.660
"I'm her big sister,but
often,I forget that.

41:27.780 --> 41:33.620
"Because the truth is that most
of the time,I look up to her.

41:36.300 --> 41:37.970
" Sometimes is everything okay?

41:40.170 --> 41:42.410
yeah.It will be.

41:44.010 --> 41:46.670
I hope it will be.
