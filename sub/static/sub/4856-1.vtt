(Narrator)
Long ago, and far away,

00:12.897 --> 00:14.899
in a village high on a mountaintop,

00:15.149 --> 00:17.651
something amazing was occurring.

00:17.818 --> 00:21.906
At the very same moment, two
identical baby girls were born.

00:24.450 --> 00:29.455
One, a baby Princess.
The King and Queen were overjoyed.

00:30.623 --> 00:34.376
Princess Anneliese would
have only the finest.

00:37.087 --> 00:39.506
The second baby girl was named Erika.

00:39.757 --> 00:43.886
Her parents loved her every bit as much
as the King and Queen loved the Princess.

00:44.511 --> 00:47.640
But they worried.
They were so poor.

00:47.723 --> 00:50.851
How would they be
able to care for their little daughter?

00:53.687 --> 00:55.356
Many years passed.

00:55.898 --> 00:57.858
The Princess learned her royal duties,

00:58.484 --> 01:03.280
while Erika worked long and hard as a
seamstress for the spiteful Madame Carp.

01:05.032 --> 01:08.869
With lives so different, it
wasn't surprising that the Princess

01:08.911 --> 01:10.996
and the Pauper never met.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.375
But fate decreed they would.

01:35.979 --> 01:38.481
It all started at the Royal Mine.

01:40.316 --> 01:44.070
When the miners informed the
Queen the gold had run out.

01:44.904 --> 01:47.156
The widowed Queen was shocked.

01:47.448 --> 01:52.036
The Kingdom was no bankrupt. How was
she going to take care of her people?

01:52.704 --> 01:56.291
If only she could call on
her trusted advisor Preminger,

01:56.499 --> 01:59.002
But he was away on a long journey.

01:59.294 --> 02:02.672
She needed to do something quickly
to save the Kingdom.

02:02.672 --> 02:04.132
But what?

02:05.091 --> 02:07.260
And then it struck her.

02:07.302 --> 02:11.306
Nearby lived a rich young
King who was seeking a wife.
(End Narration)

02:18.313 --> 02:25.737
Oh. We're late, late, late. We have 20
maximum 22 minutes for your royal fitting.

02:25.862 --> 02:30.867
Then it's move, move, move. Your
speech at the Historical Society.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.704
After that we have the
rush. And I mean rush

02:34.913 --> 02:37.624
to the Horicortural Society Tea.

02:38.374 --> 02:42.962
And then there's your math lessons, your
geography lessons, your science...

02:43.004 --> 02:47.550
(Singing)
All my life I've always wanted
to have one day just for me.

02:47.759 --> 02:51.679
Nothing to do and for
once nowhere I need to be.

02:51.763 --> 02:55.767
With no lessons, Lords, or lunches,
Or 'to do' list in the way,

02:56.226 --> 03:02.899
No one to say when to eat
or read or leave or stay

03:03.149 --> 03:07.946
That would be the day

03:11.115 --> 03:15.286
All my life I've always wanted
To have one day for myself

03:15.537 --> 03:19.707
Not waking up with a pile
of work on every shelf.

03:19.958 --> 03:24.128
With no hems in need of pressing,
and no sleeves in disarray,

03:24.254 --> 03:31.219
No wedding gown with a
thousand stitches to crochet

03:31.427 --> 03:36.057
And no debt to pay.

03:36.599 --> 03:37.809
Madame Carp!

03:37.934 --> 03:40.979
What do you think I'm running here?
A cabaret?

03:41.604 --> 03:43.690
I would've said a debtor's prison.

03:43.690 --> 03:48.695
Keep laughing. You'll be working
for me for another 37 years.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.865
But I've already paid
off more than half.

03:51.906 --> 03:53.741
But there's interest isn't there?

03:53.825 --> 03:56.995
Your parents should've thought of
that before they borrowed so much.

03:56.995 --> 04:00.999
- They did it to feed me!
- Their mistake.

04:02.125 --> 04:06.129
- What would it be like to be...
- What would it be like to be...

04:06.504 --> 04:10.508
- Free.
- Free.

04:10.592 --> 04:14.596
Free to try crazy things

04:14.846 --> 04:18.850
Free from endless IOU's

04:19.224 --> 04:23.187
- Free to find
- Free to see

04:23.228 --> 04:28.442
And marry whom I choose.

04:30.444 --> 04:32.446
(Speaking)
I'm so sorry, my darling,

04:32.487 --> 04:35.908
but as you know, it is vital
you marry King Dominick.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.744
It is the only way to
take care of our people.

04:38.785 --> 04:41.455
I know. It's my duty.

04:41.496 --> 04:43.248
Oh, and look!

04:43.332 --> 04:46.919
Another engagement gift.

04:47.044 --> 04:51.048
(Singing)
You would think that I'm so lucky
that I have so many things

04:51.340 --> 04:55.344
I'm realizing that every
present comes with strings.

04:55.802 --> 04:59.806
Though I know I have so little,
my determination's strong.

05:00.390 --> 05:06.813
People will gather around
the world to hear my song.

05:07.231 --> 05:11.235
Can I come along?

05:11.944 --> 05:14.279
- Now I fear I'll never be

05:14.363 --> 05:16.573
- Soon I will forever be

05:16.657 --> 05:20.661
- Free!
- Free!

05:20.994 --> 05:29.127
If I close my eyes I'd feel
myself fly up a thousand miles away

05:29.711 --> 05:33.507
I could take flight
but would it be right?

05:33.549 --> 05:39.513
My conscious tells me stay.

05:40.430 --> 05:42.516
- I'll remain forever royal

05:42.558 --> 05:44.977
- I'll repay my parent's debt

05:45.018 --> 05:48.856
Duty means doing the things
your heart they well regret

05:48.897 --> 05:51.149
But I'll never stop believing

05:51.191 --> 05:53.527
She can never stop my schemes

05:53.569 --> 05:57.948
There's more to living than gloves
and gowns and threads and seams

05:58.115 --> 06:00.450
In my dreams

06:00.534 --> 06:05.706
I'll be free!
(Song Ends)

06:48.832 --> 06:52.836
Ok, what idiot put this in here?

06:53.921 --> 06:55.505
Oh, that would be me.

06:55.505 --> 06:59.509
Let us review, shall we?
We are stealing gold!

06:59.760 --> 07:01.762
- Is this shiny?
- No.

07:01.803 --> 07:04.348
- Valuable?
- No.

07:04.389 --> 07:07.517
- Gonna make the boss happy?
- No.

07:07.517 --> 07:11.521
Focus, Nick.
That's what you need. That and

07:11.604 --> 07:13.606
a break.

07:15.149 --> 07:16.317
Shh!

07:31.624 --> 07:33.042
Why, hello.

07:35.086 --> 07:39.090
Master Preminger, you're
back... here... early.

07:39.090 --> 07:41.926
Hope you had a nice journey.

07:46.389 --> 07:50.393
Here you are, sir. The last of
the gold from the Royal Mine.

07:50.643 --> 07:54.647
- There's nothing left.
- Yeah, 'cos it's all yours!

07:55.606 --> 08:00.027
Yes, it is, very much mine.

08:01.112 --> 08:03.531
Finally!

08:04.115 --> 08:07.451
(Singing)
I've been bowing, I've been scraping,
I've been lying like a rug

08:07.535 --> 08:11.289
And for 10 long years I've
had to pay my dues.

08:11.289 --> 08:14.709
But today I am escaping,
for the last hole has been dug

08:14.709 --> 08:18.170
It was waiting there,
so how could I refuse?

08:18.212 --> 08:21.757
I'm returning home a hero
who's discovered mighty wealth

08:21.841 --> 08:25.303
and what better husband
could a Princess choose?

08:25.303 --> 08:29.182
I'm the suitor who will suit her, bring
the Kingdom back to health,

08:29.223 --> 08:32.768
and I'll wear the crown,
for how could I refuse?

08:32.852 --> 08:36.355
Raise every glass
and rouse every cheer!

08:36.438 --> 08:40.025
Praise that the reign
of Preminger is here!

08:40.025 --> 08:43.486
Master in charge of all that I see

08:43.529 --> 08:46.657
All hail me!

08:46.741 --> 08:49.952
And by marrying the Princess
I get all that I desire,

08:50.036 --> 08:53.748
Like a moat, an ermine
coat and palace views

08:53.789 --> 08:57.376
Even though she treats me coldly,
it's a sign of inner fire

08:57.460 --> 09:01.464
For inside she's thinking,
"How can I refuse?"

09:01.214 --> 09:05.218
(Speaking)
Right, except for
this one little problem, Boss.

09:05.218 --> 09:07.887
- That's Prince Boss to you!
- Right, and

09:07.929 --> 09:10.973
The Queen decided to marry her off
to the King of Dulcenia next week.

09:11.224 --> 09:12.308
What?!

09:12.517 --> 09:16.521
Making a decision without me?
Who does she think she is?

09:16.646 --> 09:17.772
Uh, the Queen?

09:17.813 --> 09:21.192
- You simpering simpleton!
- Well, she is the Queen!

09:21.234 --> 09:24.487
She's got a crown, a scepter, and
sits in her great big fancy chair...

09:24.695 --> 09:26.656
- and those...
- Silencio!

09:26.739 --> 09:28.741
(Singing)
No! I won't let go!

09:28.991 --> 09:33.829
This peasant's son won't turn and run
because the reckless royal chose another beau!

09:36.999 --> 09:39.585
Ahh!

09:39.669 --> 09:42.672
It's... a...

09:42.713 --> 09:44.799
Temporary setback!

09:44.840 --> 09:47.385
It's a momentary loss

09:47.426 --> 09:51.388
But conveniently my ego doesn't bruise

09:51.847 --> 09:55.851
And the moment that I get back
I will show them who's the boss

09:56.268 --> 09:59.980
You can bet your bullion
there'll be no "I do"'s

10:00.021 --> 10:03.692
Yes, suppose the girl goes missing
So the king says "au revoir"

10:03.692 --> 10:06.862
Then I find her, bring her back,
and make the news

10:06.903 --> 10:10.282
Then the Queen will be so grateful
That she'll pledge the heir to moi

10:10.323 --> 10:13.410
And I'll  humbly tell her
"How can I refuse?"

10:13.410 --> 10:16.121
When our ceremony's over
I'll arise and take the throne

10:16.121 --> 10:18.707
And that nitwit
Anneliese can kiss my shoe

10:18.707 --> 10:21.167
For the Kingdom and the castle
will be mine and mine alone

10:21.209 --> 10:24.296
If the crown should fit
then how can I refuse?

10:24.296 --> 10:26.423
So... get..

10:26.423 --> 10:30.051
ready with the roses and
stand by with the champagne

10:30.135 --> 10:33.013
When you've got a brilliant
plan you never lose

10:33.013 --> 10:36.057
Yes before the chapter closes
I'll be as big as Charlemagne

10:36.141 --> 10:37.184
It's a thankless job... but

10:37.225 --> 10:39.352
How can I refuse?

10:39.436 --> 10:47.402
How can I refuse?
(Song Ends)

11:15.388 --> 11:19.392
Enjoy it now, sister, 'cos it
ain't gonna be yours much longer.

11:19.643 --> 11:23.480
Oh, please, having
delusions again, Midas?

11:23.522 --> 11:26.691
Let's just say the throne's gonna
belong to my master, Preminger.

11:26.733 --> 11:30.737
and anything belonging to him
ergo and ipso facto, belongs to me.

11:48.380 --> 11:51.675
- You lose a tooth, Midas?
- My tooth?

11:51.675 --> 11:54.886
No, no, not my tooth!

11:59.599 --> 12:03.603
Ah you better hope you
got 9 lives, Serafina!

12:04.104 --> 12:06.898
'Cos you're gonna need 'em all!

12:14.823 --> 12:19.202
I am Ambassador Bismark, here
by invitation of the Queen.

12:21.580 --> 12:25.584
King Dominick, you are
quite sure about this?

12:25.709 --> 12:27.711
I am.

12:37.511 --> 12:39.138
Come in!

12:40.014 --> 12:42.558
Julian, perfect timing.

12:42.892 --> 12:47.730
I classified this as iron pyrite.
Pretty, but not considered valuable.

12:47.897 --> 12:51.901
- Commonly known as "fools gold".
- Well done, your Highness.

12:52.443 --> 12:55.738
Your Highness? Why the sudden formality?

12:55.779 --> 12:59.658
- It's just me.
- The Queen sent me.

12:59.742 --> 13:03.746
Apparently the Ambassador has
arrived with a gift for you.

13:03.913 --> 13:07.917
The Ambassador?
He's here already?

13:09.710 --> 13:12.504
On behalf of King Dominick...

13:12.796 --> 13:16.008
I present this engagement gift to you.

13:18.385 --> 13:22.598
Oh! Thank you, Ambassador! Princess
Anneliese will be quite pleased.

13:23.516 --> 13:28.687
May I enquire, Your Excellency, if
you've set a date for the wedding?

13:29.355 --> 13:31.273
Will a week from today do?

13:31.315 --> 13:33.108
Ah! Next week?

13:35.528 --> 13:39.532
A most wise and thoughtful
decision, Your Majesty.

13:39.615 --> 13:40.407
Excellent.

13:40.616 --> 13:47.831
I will... er, send for King Dominick,
so that he may meet his new bride.

14:01.512 --> 14:05.516
So happy.
Free to do whatever they want.

14:07.309 --> 14:09.603
What do you think King
Dominick will be like?

14:10.020 --> 14:11.981
Oh I'm sure he'll be... suitable.

14:12.398 --> 14:17.403
Oh, I know it's the right thing to marry
him, but sometimes I wish... well...

14:18.279 --> 14:22.157
Apparently he's a lover of music.
He plays 3 different instruments.

14:22.199 --> 14:25.411
The dulcimer, the
trumpet, and the piano.

14:28.414 --> 14:33.210
Anneliese...
you're going to need your cape.

14:34.211 --> 14:36.797
I am?
Why?

14:41.719 --> 14:45.723
There's nothing like some fresh
air and a change of scenery.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.226
I wish it were that simple.

14:51.937 --> 14:53.939
Come on, Serafina.

15:03.324 --> 15:06.493
Ah, it feels so good to be
outside the castle walls.

15:06.535 --> 15:08.787
Nobody knows who I am.

15:09.205 --> 15:11.624
So, which one was your house?

15:11.707 --> 15:14.501
More of a room, really.
We couldn't afford a house.

15:14.543 --> 15:17.087
- Oh, I didn't mean...
- I know.

15:17.338 --> 15:21.133
Third floor on the left.
Did all my studies there.

15:29.224 --> 15:32.060
A perfect example of 'rosa centifolia'.

15:32.101 --> 15:36.105
My favorite!
But, you knew that.

15:41.236 --> 15:43.821
Mmm, that smells delicous.

15:46.616 --> 15:49.619
I'll be right back.

16:00.630 --> 16:06.010
(Singing)
Like a bird that
flies in the morning light

16:06.302 --> 16:11.891
Or a butterfly in the spring

16:12.559 --> 16:18.523
When your spirit rides
on the wings of hope

16:18.857 --> 16:24.237
You'll find your wings

16:25.530 --> 16:28.324
(Spoken)
Let's go listen, Serafina.

16:36.833 --> 16:42.422
(Singing)
For you're
always free to begin again

16:42.505 --> 16:48.344
And you're always free to believe

16:48.595 --> 16:54.601
May you find your place
and your heart become...

16:54.934 --> 16:55.935
G'day.

16:56.144 --> 16:57.937
Madame Carp!

17:00.607 --> 17:02.650
Wait, I earned that!

17:02.692 --> 17:08.906
And you owe me. Did you really think
you could make a living as a singer?

17:09.031 --> 17:13.036
Get back to work, girl,
or there'll be trouble.

17:20.126 --> 17:23.128
- What a beautiful song.
- Thanks.

17:23.213 --> 17:26.799
My Mom taught it... to... me.

17:30.428 --> 17:31.429
Whoa.

17:35.391 --> 17:38.144
We could be sisters.

17:38.394 --> 17:40.146
- What's your name?
- What's your name?

17:40.522 --> 17:44.192
- You first.
- Please, call me Anneliese.

17:44.234 --> 17:48.029
Anneliese? You have the
same name as the Princess.

17:48.238 --> 17:52.200
- Well...
- Oh.

17:52.909 --> 17:55.662
I'm Erika, Your Highness.

17:55.745 --> 17:58.873
Aren't you supposed to
be inside the castle?

17:58.998 --> 18:03.795
I'm savoring a first and last taste of
freedom before getting married next week...

18:03.920 --> 18:06.464
to a total stranger.

18:06.631 --> 18:08.966
At least you're not an indentured servant.

18:09.842 --> 18:12.386
Indentured servant?

18:13.095 --> 18:17.099
(Singing)
If I'd like to have my breakfast hot
Madame Carp will make me pay

18:17.099 --> 18:21.311
And I have to fetch the eggs myself
And the barn's a mile away

18:21.395 --> 18:25.399
It's cold and wet and still I get
An omlette on my plate

18:25.607 --> 18:30.445
But in my head I'm back in bed
Snuggled up and sleeping late.

18:30.612 --> 18:32.948
(Spoken)
- Really?
- Really, but it's alright.

18:33.282 --> 18:35.450
I mean, I'm used to it.
And you?

18:35.492 --> 18:38.287
- Well...
- Well?

18:38.412 --> 18:42.416
(Singing)
If I want some eggs I ring the bell
And the maid comes running in.

18:42.708 --> 18:46.712
And she serves them on a silver tray
And she brings a cookie tin.

18:47.004 --> 18:51.008
And while I eat, she rubs my feet
And strolling minstrels play

18:51.133 --> 18:55.929
But I'd rather be in my library
reading science books all day.

18:58.849 --> 19:01.018
- I'm just like you
- You are?

19:01.018 --> 19:02.895
You're just like me

19:02.895 --> 19:06.899
There's somewhere else we'd rather be.

19:07.316 --> 19:12.070
Somewhere that's ours
Somewhere that dreams come true

19:12.154 --> 19:15.657
Yes, I am a girl like you.

19:15.741 --> 19:19.745
You'd never think that it was so

19:19.912 --> 19:23.916
But now I've met you and I know

19:24.166 --> 19:29.338
It's plain as day, sure as the sky is blue

19:29.046 --> 19:33.050
That I am a girl like you.

19:35.344 --> 19:37.721
(Spoken)
So! You're a singer?

19:37.804 --> 19:40.557
No, I work at Madame
Carp's penitentiary.

19:40.682 --> 19:44.686
- Uh, I mean Dress Emporium.
- I love Madame Carp's Dresses!

19:45.395 --> 19:47.814
I made the one you're wearing.

19:47.940 --> 19:51.193
You made this? It's my favorite.

19:51.235 --> 19:55.239
- The design looks so complicated!
- Oh, but it isn't, really...

19:58.659 --> 20:02.663
(Singing)
First I choose a fabric from the rack
And I pin the pattern down

20:02.704 --> 20:06.708
And I stitch it in the front and back
And it turns into a gown.

20:07.292 --> 20:11.088
I wear the gown, without my crown
And dance around my room.

20:11.088 --> 20:15.717
(Both)
And imagine life without the
strife of an unfamiliar groom.

20:16.885 --> 20:20.055
(Spoken)
But I'd never let my Mother know.
I wouldn't want to disappoint her.

20:20.222 --> 20:22.516
I completely understand.

20:23.767 --> 20:25.477
(Singing)
- I'm just like you
- I think that's true

20:25.686 --> 20:27.563
- You're just like me
- Yes, I can see

20:27.604 --> 20:31.608
(Both)
We take responsibility.

20:31.900 --> 20:36.321
We carry through/ We carry through
Do what we need to do

20:36.488 --> 20:40.409
(Both)
Yes, I am a girl like you

20:40.409 --> 20:44.413
I'm just like you/I'm just like you
You're just like me/You're just like me

20:44.621 --> 20:48.625
(Both)
It's something anyone can see

20:48.709 --> 20:50.752
- A heart that beats
- A heart that beats

20:50.836 --> 20:53.462
(Both)
A voice that speaks the truth

20:53.504 --> 20:57.508
(Both)
Yes, I am a girl like you.

21:00.887 --> 21:04.056
It's amazing!
Except for our hair.

21:04.015 --> 21:06.809
We could be twins!

21:09.896 --> 21:12.106
What about this birthmark?

21:16.110 --> 21:18.863
Hm, no, I guess not.

21:19.238 --> 21:21.199
Here, Your Highness.

21:27.079 --> 21:30.082
It's... uncanny.

21:36.047 --> 21:38.216
Serafina!

21:38.299 --> 21:40.510
Wolfie!

22:20.508 --> 22:25.304
- Look who's a long way from the Palace!
- Don't get any ideas, Midas.

22:25.388 --> 22:29.392
- I don't get these nails filed for nothing.
- I'll take my chances.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.815
I'm warning you, leave her alone!

22:35.940 --> 22:39.318
Heh! Or you'll do what?
Spit a hairball at me?

22:55.501 --> 22:57.879
Quite a big bark you have there, Rover!

22:58.212 --> 23:01.799
Uh, it's uh, Wolfie.
Not Rover.

23:03.009 --> 23:05.761
Well, thank you Wolfie,
not Rover.

23:06.929 --> 23:09.724
My name's Serafina.

23:10.141 --> 23:12.894
Uh, I haven't seen
you around here before.

23:13.019 --> 23:16.189
I don't think we run in
the same circles, but...

23:16.314 --> 23:19.066
perhaps we can change that.

23:20.193 --> 23:22.403
- There you are.
- There you are.

23:22.612 --> 23:24.864
Did I just hear your cat bark?

23:24.906 --> 23:28.117
He has a style all his own.

23:31.329 --> 23:34.957
I'm sorry, Your Highness,
we should be getting back.

23:35.082 --> 23:38.085
One day you must sing
for us at the Palace.

23:38.211 --> 23:39.836
Really?

23:40.003 --> 23:42.088
I'll send someone for you.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.299
I'll be at Madame Carp's.

23:44.508 --> 23:48.136
Goodbye, Erika!
I won't forget.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.597
Goodbye!

23:51.681 --> 23:54.267
Come on, Wolfie.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.728
Wolfie?

23:58.396 --> 24:00.774
Cat got your tongue?

24:01.233 --> 24:03.193
Come on, boy.

24:31.513 --> 24:35.517
I may be dainty, but I'm still a feline!

24:57.414 --> 24:59.666
We did it!
Let's go.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.585
Come here, Nick.

25:03.837 --> 25:09.676
Our job is to capture the Princess...
not her cat!

25:09.843 --> 25:11.094
Right.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.639
What'd we get the cat for?

25:14.723 --> 25:17.851
Allow me to demonstrate, dimwit.

25:29.196 --> 25:30.864
Serafina?

25:33.074 --> 25:34.951
Serafina, where are you?

25:38.788 --> 25:42.542
Serafina, come here
girl, come here kitty!

25:46.129 --> 25:48.006
Serafina?

26:12.197 --> 26:15.116
Well! That certainly wasn't called for.

26:15.200 --> 26:20.413
- Ooo, are you okay?
- No, I am not okay!

26:20.705 --> 26:27.169
My Mistress is inside with two hooligans,
and I've got dirt... dirt on my bum!

26:28.671 --> 26:29.922
Who are you?

26:30.881 --> 26:32.550
Herve.

26:33.676 --> 26:37.012
Nice to meet you, Herve.
I'm Serafina.

26:37.847 --> 26:40.140
I command you to unlock this door!

26:40.182 --> 26:44.562
- Yes, Your Highness!
- (mimicking) Yes, Your Highness!

26:44.603 --> 26:47.273
We're in charge here!

26:47.606 --> 26:50.526
Right.
I knew that!

26:53.529 --> 26:58.742
I can't believe they won't let me in there.
My Princess needs me.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.121
I'm sure the boss will let her out.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.956
What boss?

27:04.999 --> 27:06.876
That boss!

27:20.598 --> 27:24.602
Signed, sealed, and
delivered Master Preminger!

27:25.019 --> 27:28.063
Does she know I'm behind this?

27:28.147 --> 27:30.733
- No idea.
- Good!

27:30.774 --> 27:34.737
Keep her here until the wedding
to King Dominick is cancelled.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.782
Then we'll see who the Princess marries!

27:42.786 --> 27:46.540
Oh, he is nasty!
Just like his dog.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.629
Think you could get me up to the roof?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.342
I do not know. It is pretty high up.

27:56.467 --> 27:59.845
You can do this!
Trust me, Herve.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.097
Just count to 3.

28:03.390 --> 28:07.394
1, 2, 3...

28:09.939 --> 28:12.233
Thank you, Herve.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.574
A girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do!

28:25.871 --> 28:28.165
Serafina?

28:28.415 --> 28:31.961
I am simply not going to look at myself.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.425
Anneliese.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.761
Anneliese, Darling?

28:41.762 --> 28:43.848
Are you here?

28:48.811 --> 28:52.147
Where could she be?
She wasn't at breakfast.

28:52.523 --> 28:55.651
Is that something on
her desk, Your Majesty?

29:01.574 --> 29:03.868
Oh, a letter to me.

29:05.327 --> 29:10.332
It says she's run away, so she
won't have to marry King Dominick!

29:12.333 --> 29:15.879
Well this is dreadful!

29:16.296 --> 29:19.048
We have to find her.
She could be hurt!

29:19.507 --> 29:24.721
Well I'll send out search parties at once, Your
Majesty. I'm sure she couldn't have gotten far.

29:27.098 --> 29:30.643
Preminger, what would I do without you?

29:32.770 --> 29:36.774
This is an outrage!
The most grievous insult!

29:37.108 --> 29:39.819
I am sure we'll find her.

29:39.944 --> 29:46.618
I insist we cancel the wedding if the
Princess does not return by the end of the day!

29:46.868 --> 29:49.662
It doesn't add up.
Why would she run away?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.957
Why don't you see for yourself.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.463
Lilac?

29:58.755 --> 30:02.300
- Where did you find this?
- On the Princess's desk.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.762
Perhaps I can help you look for her.

30:05.762 --> 30:10.558
Why don't you stick to
your books, schoolboy.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.269
Wouldn't that be fun?

30:16.439 --> 30:20.693
Lilac? She never scented
her stationary with lilac.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.446
It was always rose.

30:31.287 --> 30:37.335
Welcome, sir. Are you looking
for a gown for a special lady?

30:37.669 --> 30:43.508
I can assure you, you will find only
the finest at Madame Carp's.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.762
If I may, I would like to speak to
one of your seamstresses, Miss Erika.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.766
I don't believe it!
The Princess sent for me!

30:51.766 --> 30:54.894
- Oh, actually...
- I'm going to sing at the Castle... me!

30:54.894 --> 30:57.313
- I came because...
- But, I'm not ready.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.524
- I-I have to rehearse.
- If I could just...

30:59.607 --> 31:03.611
I better change my dress. Ho-ho, what
am I talking about? I only have one dress!

31:04.487 --> 31:07.115
Wait, isn't that why you're here?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.075
I'm sorry, but no.

31:10.493 --> 31:14.164
The Princess is missing and I
need you to help me find her.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.749
Me?
Well what can I do?

31:16.833 --> 31:19.127
Pretend to be
Princess Anneliese.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.298
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen.

31:23.298 --> 31:29.345
I suspect Preminger, the Queen's Advisor, has
taken the Princess off somewhere so the
Royal Wedding will be cancelled.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.930
That's awful.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.808
If you pretend to be the
Princess, just for a short while,

31:33.892 --> 31:37.020
I can trick Preminger into
revealing where he's hiding her.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.189
Pretend to be royalty?

31:39.230 --> 31:42.025
I could get thrown in prison, or worse!

31:42.108 --> 31:44.194
As can I but...

31:46.029 --> 31:48.531
She's in real trouble, isn't she?

31:52.202 --> 31:54.495
A girl like me...

31:55.205 --> 31:56.872
Count me in.

32:29.279 --> 32:31.782
Would you look at the size of this place!

32:37.496 --> 32:41.667
- The likeness is remarkable.
- Except for my hair.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.961
I've thought of that.

32:49.174 --> 32:51.051
Wolfie!

32:56.390 --> 32:58.058
Nice!

32:59.476 --> 33:01.770
Blond in a box.

33:15.784 --> 33:19.788
Um, Julian, we're missing
one teeny tiny detail.

33:22.207 --> 33:24.751
I don't know a thing
about being a Princess.

33:24.710 --> 33:26.587
Leave that to me.

33:27.880 --> 33:32.467
It's all here in the Princess's
Book of Etiquette. Let's begin.

33:33.385 --> 33:39.391
No nagging, bragging, sweating, fretting,
slipping, tripping, slurping, burping,
twittering or frittering allowed.

33:40.142 --> 33:43.896
Stay present, stay pleasant, stay proud.

33:44.605 --> 33:48.483
(Singing)
To be a Princess
is to know which spoon to use

33:48.483 --> 33:51.945
To be a Princess
is to own a thousand pairs of shoes.

33:52.029 --> 33:56.033
To maintain a regal gait
leave the parsley on your plate

33:56.200 --> 34:00.204
And be charming but detached
and yet amused.

34:01.205 --> 34:05.209
To be a Princess
is to never be confused.

34:09.505 --> 34:13.509
Do a plié and never fall
don't ever stray from protocol

34:13.634 --> 34:17.638
All through the day
there's just one way you must behave

34:17.763 --> 34:21.683
Do keep a grip and never crack
stiff upper lip and arch the back

34:21.934 --> 34:26.730
Bend from above
and always wear your gloves, and wave.

34:27.731 --> 34:29.608
Shoulders back and
tummy in and

34:29.650 --> 34:31.485
Pinky out and
lift the chin and

34:31.527 --> 34:35.906
Slowly turn the head from side to side.
- I see now.

34:36.114 --> 34:39.868
Breathing gently, stepping lightly
Smile brightly, nod politely

34:39.993 --> 34:43.955
Never show a thing you feel inside.

34:43.996 --> 34:46.415
Glide.

34:46.581 --> 34:50.585
To be a Princess
is to always look your best.

34:50.710 --> 34:54.549
To be a Princess
is to never get to rest.

34:54.590 --> 34:56.509
Sit for a portrait, never squirm.

34:56.551 --> 34:58.678
Sleep on a mattress extra firm.

34:58.719 --> 35:02.682
Speak and be clever
never at a loss for words.

35:03.015 --> 35:04.976
Curtsy to every Count and Lord.

35:05.017 --> 35:07.144
Learn how to play the harpsichord.

35:07.186 --> 35:11.107
Sing lullabies and always
harmonize in thirds.

35:11.148 --> 35:14.694
(Both)
Thirds, thirds.

35:14.694 --> 35:17.864
And... she has beautiful eyes

35:17.905 --> 35:21.576
Your spirits rise when
she walks in the room.

35:21.617 --> 35:22.702
(Spoken)
I see.

35:22.702 --> 35:26.289
Doors close and the chemistry grows.

35:26.289 --> 35:31.502
She's like a rose
that's forever in bloom.

35:33.713 --> 35:35.882
- Do a plié and don't
- Ever ever ever fall

35:35.882 --> 35:38.009
- Never show dismay
- And be there when people call

35:38.009 --> 35:42.013
Be prepared whatever royal life will bring

35:42.013 --> 35:44.182
- Do keep a grip and don't...
- Ever ever ever crack

35:44.182 --> 35:46.350
- Take a dainty sip
- Never ever turn your back

35:46.434 --> 35:50.438
There's a time and place
and way for everything

35:51.898 --> 35:55.902
To be a princess
Is to never make your bed

35:55.902 --> 36:06.537
To be a princess
Is to always use your head
(Song Ends)

36:16.297 --> 36:18.591
It is official, then.

36:18.674 --> 36:24.931
Due to the disappearance of the Princess,
the wedding to King Dominick is cancelled.

36:28.976 --> 36:30.853
Your Highness, wait!

36:30.895 --> 36:34.857
May I present, Princess Anneliese.

36:37.527 --> 36:39.612
Darling?

37:02.093 --> 37:06.097
Anneliese?
Oh-hoh, you're back!

37:06.889 --> 37:09.183
Where have you been?

37:10.184 --> 37:14.188
I am sorry. I should not have run away.

37:16.399 --> 37:19.318
Promise me you'll never do it again.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.906
I still think we should cancel the wedding.

37:26.909 --> 37:31.705
Yes, yes, but an agreement is an
agreement. The wedding is back on!

37:32.205 --> 37:36.168
King Dominick is...
is, is due tomorrow!

37:36.376 --> 37:38.044
Wonderful.

37:38.587 --> 37:40.005
Uh, tomorrow?

37:40.005 --> 37:44.009
And then, only a few short
days before the wedding.

37:46.344 --> 37:48.972
Has anyone seen my spectacles?

37:49.139 --> 37:53.143
If you'll excuse me,
I must be off to see to the...

37:53.310 --> 37:55.812
ack!... arrangements.

38:02.569 --> 38:05.488
Who let this mangey beast in here?

38:07.908 --> 38:09.784
Everything alright, Preminger?

38:10.202 --> 38:12.287
It soon will be.

38:20.212 --> 38:22.297
What have you got there, boy?

38:27.135 --> 38:29.137
From a silver fir tree.

38:29.513 --> 38:32.432
What's Preminger doing
in the Western Forest?

38:33.683 --> 38:37.729
Julian, wait! I want to hear all
about how you found Anneliese!

38:38.730 --> 38:42.734
Ah... ah... of course, Your Majesty.

38:45.987 --> 38:52.035
- Hey! I happen to know you've got
a 5 of hearts.
- What do you mean you know?

38:52.160 --> 38:55.956
- I saw it!
- You mean you cheated!

38:56.039 --> 38:57.707
Yeah.

38:57.791 --> 38:59.209
I mean, no!

38:59.334 --> 39:01.628
Help, help!

39:01.795 --> 39:04.089
Please, help me!

39:04.172 --> 39:06.258
- Yes, Your Highness?
- What is it?

39:06.466 --> 39:07.926
Hurry!

39:13.306 --> 39:14.432
Ghost!

39:14.516 --> 39:16.184
Get it!
Quick!

39:16.476 --> 39:17.727
You're older, you get it!

39:17.769 --> 39:20.272
You're closer, you get it!

39:22.190 --> 39:23.859
It's got me!

39:25.402 --> 39:27.070
Help!

39:27.195 --> 39:30.115
- No, please!
- Well done, Serafina.

39:34.703 --> 39:36.163
Go, go!

39:58.518 --> 40:01.855
Let me in... you idiots!

40:02.898 --> 40:06.151
Your Bossness,
everything is fine.

40:06.193 --> 40:10.197
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
Just fine! See you soon.

40:15.326 --> 40:17.203
How did she escape?

40:17.244 --> 40:20.581
- Who?
- Who? The Princess!

40:20.831 --> 40:23.125
You moron!
Idiot!

40:24.543 --> 40:26.212
The Princess is here.

40:26.587 --> 40:28.464
Sleeping!

40:28.881 --> 40:31.592
Aren't you sleeping, Princess?!

40:31.675 --> 40:36.472
(High Pitched Voice)
Yes. I'm sleeping.

40:36.805 --> 40:40.059
Now, boss, you don't want
to wake her up, do you?

40:40.309 --> 40:42.186
She's a Royal...

40:42.311 --> 40:45.856
She's a Royal, all right,
a royal pain in the behind!

40:48.359 --> 40:50.861
Who interrupts my slipper?

40:51.487 --> 40:53.739
Slumber, you bonehead!

40:53.781 --> 40:56.575
Slumber, right!
(In normal voice): I knew that.

40:56.617 --> 40:58.494
Get out of that bed!

41:00.704 --> 41:03.958
I can figure out how the
Princess escaped you two.

41:03.999 --> 41:07.837
But why didn't she tell the
Queen she'd been captured?

41:10.297 --> 41:16.554
Hmm, something's odd. I must
solve this Princess puzzle if I'm to be King.

41:18.097 --> 41:20.391
King?
Preminger?

41:27.189 --> 41:30.734
- Looking for something, Julian?
- How can you be King?

41:33.821 --> 41:36.740
You're the tutor. You're
supposed to have all the answers.

41:48.878 --> 41:50.880
Come here, Serafina.

41:53.924 --> 41:57.928
- Who goes there?
- Princess Anneliese!

41:58.429 --> 42:00.764
If you're the Princess, I'm the King.

42:00.848 --> 42:04.185
- But, I am the Princess.
- Really?

42:04.393 --> 42:07.938
Then how come I just saw the
Princess eating dinner with the Queen?

42:09.023 --> 42:11.108
What Princess?

42:11.192 --> 42:16.197
- Now move along before I lost my temper.
- You are speaking to Princess Anneliese!

42:16.447 --> 42:18.824
- Let me through!
- I said move along!

42:18.908 --> 42:20.159
Now!

42:46.769 --> 42:48.646
We'll find help in here.

42:55.069 --> 42:58.989
- What are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon!

42:59.239 --> 43:03.243
Not another word!
You're coming with me!

43:10.583 --> 43:18.508
Not done yet? If you weren't such a... lazy
cow... those dresses would be finished by now.

43:18.675 --> 43:21.177
How dare you speak to her that way!

43:21.302 --> 43:25.306
How dare I?
H-h-how dare I?!

43:25.682 --> 43:28.601
Just who do you think you are?

43:29.686 --> 43:31.980
Princess Anneliese!

43:34.190 --> 43:35.650
That's a hoot!

43:35.775 --> 43:39.779
You've got to change a lot more
than your hair to look like the Princess.

43:40.196 --> 43:43.741
Why me and the Princess are
close, personal friends.

43:43.783 --> 43:45.160
Oh really?

43:45.160 --> 43:48.705
Now, shut up and get back to work!

43:48.913 --> 43:54.752
I'm warning you, if you're going to treat
your seamstresses this way, we'll take
our Royal business elsewhere.

43:54.878 --> 43:57.130
You're warning me?

43:57.255 --> 44:04.762
We'll see your attitude change by morning. You're
not coming out until every dress is finished... Erika!

44:05.513 --> 44:07.182
Erika?

44:11.686 --> 44:14.606
- Locked in again!
- Erika?

44:15.273 --> 44:17.358
That is you, isn't it?

44:27.452 --> 44:30.371
"Made exclusively by Madame Carp".

44:30.246 --> 44:32.749
If Wolfie can slip and in and out,

44:32.832 --> 44:35.835
I'm sure your pretty little
Serafina can do it too.

44:36.669 --> 44:38.838
It's up to you now, Serafina.

44:38.922 --> 44:43.092
Take this to the Castle. When somebody
reads the label, it'll lead them here.

45:16.668 --> 45:19.504
This is going to be a long night.

45:32.851 --> 45:36.813
I thought I was dreaming, but I'm not.

45:43.403 --> 45:47.322
Shh! Wolfie, we've gotta, you
know, act like we live here!

45:47.364 --> 45:48.824
We can't give ourselves away.

45:50.117 --> 45:53.036
Be a Princess!
Be a Princess!

45:54.830 --> 45:56.498
Come in.

45:58.208 --> 46:03.839
Did I hear a dog, Your Majesty?
Should I call the Royal Dogcatcher?

46:03.881 --> 46:06.383
Ah, no, no.
Dog?

46:06.884 --> 46:08.969
Everything is fine.

46:11.180 --> 46:15.767
- Your breakfast, Your Highness.
- Really? In bed?

46:16.226 --> 46:17.686
As always.

46:17.728 --> 46:21.273
Oh yes. Of course.
Thank you.

46:22.566 --> 46:25.903
Look at all this food!
Want some?

46:26.028 --> 46:30.616
- Oh I-I couldn't, Your Highness!
- But there's enough to feed an army!

46:30.949 --> 46:35.746
- Come on, take some.
- I, uh, thank you, um, m'lady.

46:36.079 --> 46:40.083
I'll draw your bath. Would you like
bubbles, mineral salts, or lavender oil?

46:40.792 --> 46:42.252
Everything!

46:46.673 --> 46:51.053
You're going to just tell her that
you disguised yourself as a page?

46:52.012 --> 46:55.557
Are you sure that's wise, King Dominick?

46:55.641 --> 46:58.936
No, I'm not sure. But
I have to be honest.

46:59.269 --> 47:03.857
I think she'll understand. I didn't want
to marry a stranger any more than she did.

47:12.074 --> 47:15.953
(Sighing)
I may never come out.

47:15.994 --> 47:19.248
What's wrong, Wolfie?
Are you sick?

47:19.289 --> 47:22.125
Something in your throat?

47:22.167 --> 47:24.086
Wait a minute.

47:24.086 --> 47:27.297
Are you trying to meow?

47:29.091 --> 47:31.426
Oh oh, huh.

47:31.677 --> 47:36.515
(Singing)
I can see it when you're feeling low
You can't hide that from me

47:37.140 --> 47:41.520
You're no status quo calico
So why keep trying to be?

47:41.728 --> 47:45.941
'Cause you're more than that
You're a doggish cat

47:45.983 --> 47:50.612
I wish you could see the you I see

47:51.613 --> 47:52.698
(Spoken)
No.

47:52.698 --> 47:57.119
(Singing)
I say, if you bark celebrate it

47:57.411 --> 48:00.038
Make your mark
Serenade it

48:00.122 --> 48:04.501
Noah's ark
Shoulda had a cat like you

48:04.710 --> 48:07.880
And if what you are
Is a strange you

48:07.880 --> 48:10.716
Doesn't mean
You should change you

48:10.716 --> 48:14.720
Only means
You should change your point of view

48:14.720 --> 48:15.888
(Spoken)
Princess Anneliese?

48:16.013 --> 48:20.434
Hey, feline
You fetch just fine

48:20.601 --> 48:25.814
To thine ownself be true

48:26.481 --> 48:30.902
Your bow wow's
The cat's meow

48:31.444 --> 48:36.824
It's how I know you're you

48:37.033 --> 48:40.077
You don't need the bows or tiara

48:40.036 --> 48:42.830
Bid your woes sayonara

48:42.830 --> 48:47.210
Trust your nose
'Cause it knows the way to go

48:47.376 --> 48:50.546
When you
Chase your tail You're enchanting

48:50.630 --> 48:53.132
Spirits sail
When you're panting

48:53.216 --> 48:58.596
When you wail
You're a rover, Romeo

48:58.596 --> 49:03.226
There is not
One hair of you

49:03.351 --> 49:08.731
That I would rearrange

49:09.357 --> 49:13.945
I love you the way you are

49:13.986 --> 49:19.784
And that will never change

49:19.992 --> 49:25.832
That will never

49:26.833 --> 49:30.628
change.
(Song Ends)

49:30.878 --> 49:32.755
That's my boy!

49:41.389 --> 49:43.683
There, this one's finished!

49:44.976 --> 49:46.435
Uh, sort of...

49:46.602 --> 49:49.856
Please, Your Highness,
you don't have to do this!

49:50.189 --> 49:53.109
I can't let you do it all by yourself.

50:04.579 --> 50:08.583
How am I going to do this?
Everyone will know I'm a fake.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.253
They'll throw me in the
dungeon in two seconds flat!

50:12.461 --> 50:16.465
Oh Julian, where are you?
Why aren't you here?

50:18.426 --> 50:21.345
Your most beautiful, Highness.

50:25.808 --> 50:27.685
What's this stupid cat doing here?

50:27.685 --> 50:31.689
- He belongs to me.
- Oh! He's yours, is he?

50:31.772 --> 50:34.484
Well, a thousand apologies, My Lady.

50:35.485 --> 50:38.613
Such a canine... feline.

50:39.197 --> 50:40.865
What happened to the other one?

50:40.948 --> 50:45.119
- Uh... she's around here somewhere.
- I see.

50:46.496 --> 50:49.832
So rare... that you're apart.

50:50.333 --> 50:54.337
The Queen has sent me to
escort you to meet the King.

50:54.754 --> 50:55.796
Uhh...

50:57.715 --> 50:58.841
Thank you.

51:04.847 --> 51:07.225
I appreciate your
understanding, Your Majesty.

51:07.391 --> 51:13.231
Likewise, King Dominick. I apologize for my
daughter's little delay in the wedding plans.

51:13.272 --> 51:15.775
But it's all sorted out now.

51:16.650 --> 51:20.570
May I announce, Princess Anneliese.

51:21.071 --> 51:27.118
Oh hello, Darling. Come, come.
I want to introduce you to King Dominick.

51:29.496 --> 51:31.790
He has something he wants to tell you.

51:32.707 --> 51:35.418
Where are my spectacles?

51:36.461 --> 51:38.547
I'm honored.

51:38.547 --> 51:40.215
Uhh...

51:43.468 --> 51:45.345
The honor's mine, King Dominick.

51:45.387 --> 51:48.098
Please, just call me Dominick.

51:48.306 --> 51:51.434
Oh, call me Eri...
I mean Anneliese.

51:51.810 --> 51:53.687
Princess Anneliese.

51:54.896 --> 51:56.356
That's my name.

52:02.696 --> 52:05.407
I hope his bark is bigger than his bite.

52:08.285 --> 52:10.162
He likes you.

52:10.996 --> 52:14.332
I'm sure you're wondering why
I disguised myself as a page.

52:15.083 --> 52:18.336
I wanted to meet you
without all this-this ceremony.

52:18.503 --> 52:20.589
To get to know the real you.

52:22.007 --> 52:23.466
Uh, the real me...

52:23.508 --> 52:27.596
King Dominick, would you do us
the honor of playing the piano?

52:27.762 --> 52:31.766
- I know you love music.
- You do?

52:32.184 --> 52:36.188
I will, if the Princess
agrees to sing with me.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.773
Sing with you.

52:38.899 --> 52:44.529
- Uh, no, no, I couldn't.
- Something tells me you have
a wonderful voice.

52:57.042 --> 52:59.002
Sing, darling.

53:03.381 --> 53:07.594
(Singing)
Once a lass met a lad

53:07.677 --> 53:11.681
You're a gentle one, said she

53:12.098 --> 53:16.102
In my heart I'd be glad

53:16.311 --> 53:20.315
If you loved me for me

53:20.690 --> 53:24.694
You say your love is true

53:24.986 --> 53:28.990
And I hope that it will be

53:29.282 --> 53:33.245
(Dominick)
I'd be sure, if I knew

53:33.286 --> 53:38.708
That you loved me for me

53:39.876 --> 53:43.880
(Erika)
Could I be the one you're seeking?

53:44.256 --> 53:48.176
Will I be the one you choose?

53:48.301 --> 53:52.264
Can you tell my heart is speaking?

53:52.305 --> 53:56.309
My eyes will give you clues

53:56.685 --> 54:00.564
(Dominick)
What you see may be deceiving

54:00.605 --> 54:04.608
Truth lies underneath the skin

54:04.900 --> 54:08.737
(Erika)
Hope will blossum by believing

54:08.821 --> 54:14.785
(Both)
The heart that lies within

54:15.286 --> 54:18.747
(Dominick)
I'll be yours

54:18.831 --> 54:26.797
Together we shall always be as one

54:27.006 --> 54:32.636
If you love me for me

54:33.596 --> 54:37.183
(Singing at the same time)
- Who can say where we'll go?
- I'll be yours

54:37.183 --> 54:41.395
- Together we shall always
- Who can promise what will be?

54:41.479 --> 54:44.690
- Be as one
- But I'll stay by your side

54:44.732 --> 54:48.736
If you love me for me.

54:48.777 --> 54:57.119
If you love me for me.
(Song Ends)

54:59.955 --> 55:01.832
Breath-taking.

55:03.792 --> 55:06.712
The prettiest sunset I've ever seen.

55:09.965 --> 55:12.468
There's something about you...

55:13.219 --> 55:16.055
Your eyes... no pretenses.

55:16.305 --> 55:20.893
I like that. Until
tomorrow, Your Highness.

55:33.447 --> 55:35.825
"Honest"?
"No pretenses"?

55:36.200 --> 55:39.537
Oh, Wolfie, Julian and the
Princess are still missing.

55:40.371 --> 55:42.665
And I think I'm falling
in love with the King.

55:52.174 --> 55:55.094
Why, it's our missing little feline.

55:56.637 --> 55:58.931
But with an attitude, oh yes!

55:59.682 --> 56:02.601
I never liked cats.

56:03.811 --> 56:07.565
Hm. The Princess's ring.
How odd.

56:10.401 --> 56:13.737
Madame Carp's Dress Shop?

56:14.572 --> 56:17.283
Maybe the answer to our mystery.

56:48.646 --> 56:50.523
Thank you, Herve.

56:51.024 --> 56:52.692
My Princess!

57:04.704 --> 57:06.873
Preminger, you found my ring!

57:08.583 --> 57:10.251
You good girl!

57:10.919 --> 57:13.004
Princess...

57:14.422 --> 57:16.299
Serafina, what's gotten into you?

57:16.299 --> 57:20.053
Come quickly, Princess. You can tell
me everything on the way to the castle.

57:20.178 --> 57:23.723
- But first let me...
- No, no. No time, Your Highness.

57:29.813 --> 57:31.272
Princess?

57:42.575 --> 57:44.369
What are we doing here?

57:44.369 --> 57:46.871
Taking a little side trip, Princess.

57:47.664 --> 57:49.123
You were behind this!

57:49.165 --> 57:52.418
Very clever planting
a double to fool even me.

57:52.460 --> 57:54.879
But not quite clever enough.

57:55.088 --> 57:56.631
Checkmate!

57:56.673 --> 57:58.258
I win.

57:59.300 --> 58:00.760
Serafina!

58:10.478 --> 58:13.731
Nice to see you again, Your Highness.
Watch your step.

58:14.399 --> 58:17.694
I don't understand, Preminger.
Why would you do this?

58:17.819 --> 58:19.696
To be King.

58:20.613 --> 58:25.535
- And how would you get to be King?
- Still underestimating me?

58:25.577 --> 58:27.662
Isn't that just like a Royal.

58:28.454 --> 58:31.457
- He was going to marry you.
- What?!

58:31.666 --> 58:34.377
Now, he's got a new bride in mind.

58:34.919 --> 58:38.423
Your Mother is a very handsome woman.

58:48.433 --> 58:49.893
Julian!

58:50.059 --> 58:51.519
Anneliese!

58:51.895 --> 58:56.900
How sad they'll be when they discover
you died in a tragic accident.

58:56.941 --> 58:59.319
They'll never give up
looking for the Princess!

58:59.360 --> 59:01.613
Oh I think they will.

59:01.779 --> 59:04.616
When I show them this!

59:07.494 --> 59:09.787
Oh that's funny.

59:20.965 --> 59:23.468
- No good.
- We have to stop him.

59:30.642 --> 59:32.727
Put a little muscle behind it!

59:46.740 --> 59:48.408
What's that?

59:57.167 --> 59:58.627
Move it!

01:00:08.512 --> 01:00:12.516
Everything seems to be in
order. Thank you, Ambassador.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.436
The Kingdoms will be officially
joined after the wedding tomorrow.

01:00:16.478 --> 01:00:20.482
- Are you ready, Darling?
- Ready...

01:00:20.566 --> 01:00:22.025
Well...

01:00:23.277 --> 01:00:25.362
For my bride to be.

01:00:30.576 --> 01:00:31.577
Whoa!

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:40.919
Grab her! She's an imposter!

01:00:43.714 --> 01:00:46.800
Preminger, what are you doing?

01:00:47.676 --> 01:00:51.013
- Get your hands off me!
- Release the Princess!

01:00:51.096 --> 01:00:53.807
She's a fake!
A common pauper!

01:00:54.475 --> 01:00:57.603
Are you telling me I
don't know my own daughter?

01:00:57.686 --> 01:01:01.607
I only just discovered the
truth myself, Your Majesty.

01:01:01.648 --> 01:01:04.860
Have you not wondered why we
haven't seen Julian lately?

01:01:05.027 --> 01:01:08.697
He's conspiring with this-this imposter!

01:01:08.697 --> 01:01:12.034
Together they took the Princess
and hid her in the Royal Mine so-

01:01:12.075 --> 01:01:14.786
so she could take her place,

01:01:15.037 --> 01:01:18.123
marry King Dominick
and take over the Kingdom!

01:01:18.165 --> 01:01:22.044
And what proof do you have
of this ridiculous story?

01:01:22.127 --> 01:01:26.798
Once I discovered this treachery,
I tried to rescue the Princess

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.717
but it was too late.

01:01:28.884 --> 01:01:32.221
They sabatoged the Mine, collapsing it.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.684
I'm afraid this is all my
workers found in the rubble.

01:01:37.726 --> 01:01:39.186
No!

01:01:41.939 --> 01:01:43.607
It cannot be!

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:47.027
Check her shoulder!
There's no royal birthmark.

01:01:47.152 --> 01:01:48.821
I assure you.

01:01:55.786 --> 01:01:57.204
It's true.

01:02:11.426 --> 01:02:14.763
- I don't believe it.
- I can explain.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:16.974
Throw her in the dungeon!

01:02:16.974 --> 01:02:18.267
No, wait!

01:02:18.892 --> 01:02:24.522
I-I'm not the Princess, but I
never hurt her or anybody else!

01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:27.483
Unbelieveable!

01:02:27.483 --> 01:02:29.944
It's an outrage!

01:02:30.111 --> 01:02:34.490
I-I just wanted to save
the Princess! From him!

01:02:34.824 --> 01:02:37.118
The dungeon!

01:02:46.127 --> 01:02:50.131
My daughter...
My poor daughter...

01:02:53.134 --> 01:02:56.053
What do they take us for?
Fools?

01:02:56.429 --> 01:02:59.974
Trying to marry you
off to a mere pauper!?

01:03:00.516 --> 01:03:03.978
- It doesn't make sense.
- I should say not.

01:03:04.103 --> 01:03:08.107
The sooner we leave,
the happier I'll be.

01:03:16.199 --> 01:03:19.494
(Erika singing)
Do a plié and never fall

01:03:19.494 --> 01:03:22.955
Don't ever stray from protocol

01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:29.003
All through the day
There's just one way
You must behave

01:03:30.004 --> 01:03:33.174
Do keep a grip and never crack

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.636
Stiff upper lip...

01:03:36.677 --> 01:03:44.310
Stiff upper lip...

01:03:51.359 --> 01:03:56.989
- Ah! Just who I wanted to see.
- Preminger, what is it?

01:03:57.532 --> 01:04:01.536
So many problems.
I'm here to help.

01:04:01.577 --> 01:04:03.830
- You can't bring my daughter back.
- Too true.

01:04:04.163 --> 01:04:09.168
But I can provide the answer
to saving your Kingdom.

01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:15.967
A little business venture of mine was very
successful. You could say I "struck gold".

01:04:16.843 --> 01:04:20.012
I'm as wealthy as King Dominick.

01:04:20.388 --> 01:04:24.392
(Singing)
Well your good luck has departed
and your people soon will starve

01:04:24.392 --> 01:04:27.603
Au revoir to your foie
gras and cheese fondues.

01:04:27.895 --> 01:04:32.108
But because I'm so good-hearted
half my fortune I will carve

01:04:32.191 --> 01:04:35.820
I feel your pain, so how could I refuse?

01:04:35.903 --> 01:04:40.116
But to give me some incentive,
there's just one thing I require

01:04:40.199 --> 01:04:44.036
And it's something
that you never even use

01:04:44.203 --> 01:04:48.166
And it's nothing that inventive
just the one thing I desire

01:04:48.207 --> 01:04:51.627
This simple crown,
yes, how could I refuse?

01:04:51.878 --> 01:04:55.506
Oh, don't let your spirits
falter I've a ring box in my hand

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:59.218
And I booked a band so
grab your dancing shoes

01:04:59.302 --> 01:05:03.514
And come with me to the altar
see the Kingdom as you plan

01:05:03.598 --> 01:05:07.184
Yes, marry me for how can you refuse?

01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:15.817
How can you refuse?
(Song Ends)

01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:42.928
Are you Wolfie?
Serafina's friend?

01:05:43.261 --> 01:05:45.806
- I like to think so.
- She needs help.

01:05:46.264 --> 01:05:49.100
- and so does the Princess.
- What?

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:54.689
Show me, quick!

01:06:02.155 --> 01:06:03.615
Sorry, Serafina!

01:06:14.084 --> 01:06:17.420
It's hopeless. I'm sorry, Anneliese.

01:06:18.046 --> 01:06:20.340
Do you know why I didn't
want to marry the King?

01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:25.637
- You weren't ready to get married.
- No, I was in love with somebody else.

01:06:26.263 --> 01:06:30.267
My best friend. The man
who's taught me so much.

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:35.397
But I'm not a King. I
can't give you what he can.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.357
I think you're like this.

01:06:39.484 --> 01:06:40.944
A rock?

01:06:41.778 --> 01:06:46.032
Unassuming on the outside,
and a treasure within.

01:06:51.371 --> 01:06:54.916
We'll get out of here
somehow. I promise.

01:06:58.086 --> 01:07:02.883
- Don't tell me she's in there.
- Alright, I will not tell you.

01:07:08.346 --> 01:07:11.850
Ooo, I'm getting...
Ooo yeah, I'm getting...

01:07:11.892 --> 01:07:15.228
- Uh, dizzy?
- No. A scent.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.274
There's another way in.

01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:31.953
Look at you...

01:07:32.037 --> 01:07:33.705
looking at me.

01:07:34.915 --> 01:07:36.166
Lovely.

01:07:57.186 --> 01:08:00.022
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Down here!

01:08:10.449 --> 01:08:14.745
- Whaddya make of that?
- Oh, uh, you are an excellent digger.

01:08:15.454 --> 01:08:17.997
Thank you, but I meant look!

01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:21.292
I'll bet I can get to Serafina
and the Princess this way.

01:08:54.868 --> 01:08:57.496
You are going down there?

01:08:58.913 --> 01:09:02.417
A cat always lands on his
feet, even one that barks!

01:09:11.051 --> 01:09:12.928
Erika's cat?

01:09:14.388 --> 01:09:16.140
An old mine shaft.

01:09:16.515 --> 01:09:19.225
Hello? Anybody up there?

01:09:24.148 --> 01:09:25.399
Water...

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:27.734
Here, help me!

01:09:39.955 --> 01:09:41.624
Beautiful.

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:04.622
No, let me go!

01:11:05.373 --> 01:11:09.002
Thought you could escape, did you?
I'll lock her up.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:11.713
- I'm to take her to the castle.
- But...

01:11:11.713 --> 01:11:13.590
The Queen's orders.

01:11:14.299 --> 01:11:15.884
Oh, well, right then.

01:11:29.147 --> 01:11:33.151
- Looking good, Sir Nick.
- Feeling good, Sir Nack.

01:11:40.158 --> 01:11:44.913
Smile, my Dear.
You're about to become my Queen.

01:11:44.954 --> 01:11:49.125
Only to save my people. Your
fortune will help them all.

01:11:56.633 --> 01:11:59.969
This way.
Hey!

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:04.432
- I guess I deserved that.
- Dominick?

01:12:04.557 --> 01:12:06.059
I need to explain...

01:12:06.059 --> 01:12:10.063
I don't believe you're the
person Preminger says you are.

01:12:11.064 --> 01:12:14.651
You do love disguises, don't you?

01:12:14.692 --> 01:12:16.277
Come, we need to hurry!

01:12:18.822 --> 01:12:22.826
Do you, Preminger, take
this woman to be your bride?

01:12:22.992 --> 01:12:26.955
Yes. How could I refuse?

01:12:27.288 --> 01:12:31.292
And do you, My Queen, take
this man to be your husband?

01:12:33.253 --> 01:12:34.295
I...

01:12:37.257 --> 01:12:39.134
I... uh I..

01:12:44.556 --> 01:12:46.432
- I d...
- Wait! Wait!

01:12:48.143 --> 01:12:50.145
Stop the wedding, Mother!

01:12:50.562 --> 01:12:54.440
- Anneliese?
- But, she's dead, Your Highness!

01:12:54.482 --> 01:12:56.484
The imposter must have escaped.

01:12:56.484 --> 01:12:57.944
No, Preminger.

01:13:01.698 --> 01:13:03.575
It is you!

01:13:06.536 --> 01:13:08.329
My Darling.

01:13:08.454 --> 01:13:10.331
It's the Princess! She's back!

01:13:14.419 --> 01:13:17.547
It's the Princess!
She's alive!

01:13:18.882 --> 01:13:20.758
But where were you?

01:13:21.718 --> 01:13:24.428
- I thought...
- What he wanted you to think!

01:13:26.388 --> 01:13:28.807
Guards! Take him!

01:13:30.893 --> 01:13:31.935
Hai!

01:13:33.061 --> 01:13:36.106
- He can't get away!
- He won't get away!

01:13:47.201 --> 01:13:49.077
Nice to see you again.

01:13:52.206 --> 01:13:53.999
Going somewhere?

01:13:56.126 --> 01:13:58.212
Not so fast, puffy!

01:13:58.837 --> 01:14:00.506
Now who has nowhere to go?

01:14:01.215 --> 01:14:04.134
Yeah, nowhere to go...
but through you!

01:14:11.225 --> 01:14:12.810
My tooth!

01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:16.396
Oh my beautiful tooth!

01:14:20.484 --> 01:14:22.069
Fater, you old nag!

01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:30.494
I've seen snails faster!

01:14:34.081 --> 01:14:35.332
What are you doing?

01:14:38.377 --> 01:14:39.419
Turn around!

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.840
Stop, you stupid beast!

01:14:43.382 --> 01:14:45.634
I said stop!

01:14:54.393 --> 01:14:59.189
- I like your style, Herve.
- So do I.

01:15:10.117 --> 01:15:14.496
Preminger played me for a fool.
I'm sorry, my Darling Anneliese.

01:15:15.164 --> 01:15:17.749
When I think what might have happened...

01:15:18.292 --> 01:15:22.296
But it didn't. Thanks to
Erika and the man I love...

01:15:22.713 --> 01:15:25.424
- Julian.
- Julian?

01:15:25.632 --> 01:15:29.428
He's kind, intelligent,
and my best friend.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:33.056
Mother, it's Julian I want to marry.

01:15:34.057 --> 01:15:39.480
I want you to be happy. But it is our
duty to take care of our people first.

01:15:40.105 --> 01:15:44.902
I can do that. I found something
very interesting in the mine.

01:15:49.198 --> 01:15:52.743
- I can't convince you to stay?
- Dominick, I...

01:15:54.036 --> 01:15:59.333
All my life I've dreamed of being free.
Now my debt's been paid.

01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:03.337
- Thanks to Anneliese.
- Where will you go?

01:16:03.587 --> 01:16:04.713
Everywhere.

01:16:04.755 --> 01:16:07.799
I want to sing, see the world!

01:16:08.216 --> 01:16:11.969
Then, I hope you'll take this with you.

01:16:14.597 --> 01:16:16.265
I couldn't.

01:16:19.685 --> 01:16:21.354
It was meant for you.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.069
- No promises?
- I'll take my chances.

01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:45.545
(Narrator) Princess Anneliese
was right about the Mine.

01:16:45.586 --> 01:16:49.590
She discovered it was
filled with geodes.

01:16:49.882 --> 01:16:53.886
Under her direction, the beautiful
crystals created a new industry.

01:16:55.263 --> 01:16:59.267
The Kingdom was saved.

01:17:00.101 --> 01:17:04.105
As for Madame Carp, without the word
from the Castle, she went out of business.

01:17:10.111 --> 01:17:14.115
After months of traveling, Erika
realized there was one place

01:17:14.282 --> 01:17:18.286
she wanted to stay
more than anywhere else.

01:17:19.162 --> 01:17:22.331
Sometimes being free
means choosing not to go,

01:17:22.415 --> 01:17:25.209
but to stay.

01:17:25.835 --> 01:17:34.427
(Erika Singing)
And you're always free to begin again

01:17:31.424 --> 01:17:35.428
And you're always free to believe

01:17:37.472 --> 01:17:43.478
When you find the place
That your heart belongs

01:17:43.769 --> 01:17:49.775
You'll never leave

01:17:50.443 --> 01:17:53.237
(Anneliese Singing)
You and I will always be

01:17:53.321 --> 01:17:56.199
Celebrating life together

01:17:56.199 --> 01:18:01.621
I know I have found a friend forever more

01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:05.041
Love is like a melody

01:18:05.082 --> 01:18:08.127
One that I will always treasure

01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:13.591
Courage is the key that opens every door

01:18:13.633 --> 01:18:19.222
(Erika and Anneliese together)
Though you may not know
Where your gifts may lead

01:18:19.388 --> 01:18:25.228
And it may not show at the start

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.692
When you live your dreams
You'll find destiny

01:18:31.943 --> 01:18:43.120
Is written in your heart

01:18:44.372 --> 01:18:48.584
(Narrator)
And, of course, Wolfie and Serafina
lived happily ever after.

01:18:49.168 --> 01:18:53.381
Along with their many,
many, many kittens.

01:18:56.842 --> 01:19:02.222
(Choir)
Though you may not know
Where your gifts may lead

01:19:02.681 --> 01:19:07.936
And it may not show at the start

01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:14.609
When you live your dream
You'll find destiny

01:19:14.985 --> 01:19:26.872
Is written in your heart.
(Song Ends)

01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:38.925
Standing cat is ready.
Serafina stunt test: take one.

01:19:39.009 --> 01:19:40.677
And... action!

01:19:43.722 --> 01:19:44.973
Oh, Dear.

01:19:44.973 --> 01:19:46.641
Quiet on the set please.

01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:48.059
And... action!

01:19:51.271 --> 01:19:54.816
Uh, I'm quite sure
this is a good idea.

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:57.110
Take 37.

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:58.987
And... action!

01:20:01.406 --> 01:20:03.700
<i>Ok, let's bring in Serafina.</i>

01:20:04.826 --> 01:20:06.828
Uh, can you get my agent
on the phone?

01:20:09.498 --> 01:20:11.583
My, you're attractive.

01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:16.171
(Singing)
You're no status quo calico
so why keep trying to be

01:20:16.254 --> 01:20:20.425
'cos you're more than that
you're a dogish --

01:20:20.425 --> 01:20:21.426
(Splash!)
Ruff!

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:23.178
- Wolfie!
- Cut!

01:20:23.178 --> 01:20:25.055
Ok, can I get a hair dryer
over here?

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.974
Aren't you pleasant to the eye

01:20:28.016 --> 01:20:30.101
you, reflection you!

01:20:30.685 --> 01:20:32.270
Mine cart, take one.

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:34.439
And... action!

01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:37.150
Cut!

01:20:37.567 --> 01:20:40.153
<i>Uh Nick, um, you're supposed
to jump into the cart.</i>

01:20:40.695 --> 01:20:43.240
Right. I knew that!

01:20:43.281 --> 01:20:47.661
Is that really me?
In there? Looking at me?

01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:50.038
Lucky me!

01:20:54.584 --> 01:20:56.044
Breath taking!

01:20:56.711 --> 01:20:58.171
(Sighing)
(Cell phone ringing)

01:20:58.255 --> 01:21:01.383
(Gasping)
Sorry!

01:21:01.383 --> 01:21:02.384
(Laughing)

01:21:03.385 --> 01:21:05.137
How romantic, right?

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:07.889
Very handsome, very fit!

01:21:08.557 --> 01:21:11.059
Very irresistible!

01:21:13.103 --> 01:21:15.647
- Do a plié and don't
- Ever ever ever fool

01:21:15.689 --> 01:21:32.330
- Never show dismay
- (Laughing)
