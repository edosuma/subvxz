<i>December 7, 1941...</i>

02:06.607 --> 02:10.192
President Roosevelt called it

02:10.193 --> 02:13.696
"a date which will
live in infamy."

02:14.781 --> 02:18.033
On that peaceful Sunday morning
over 70 years ago,

02:18.035 --> 02:22.738
American forces withstood
an unprovoked attack

02:22.740 --> 02:25.508
and our nation
was thrust headlong

02:25.510 --> 02:28.544
into the largest global
conflict in human history.

02:28.546 --> 02:31.680
And though the guns
have fallen silent,

02:31.682 --> 02:35.017
we still gather
at this very spot

02:35.019 --> 02:38.137
where the attack took place
to honor the survivors...

02:40.557 --> 02:42.358
and the fallen--

02:42.360 --> 02:45.361
members of our
greatest generation--

02:45.363 --> 02:48.096
and resolve to take care of them

02:48.098 --> 02:50.649
as they took care of us.

02:52.536 --> 02:54.036
You must know...

02:54.038 --> 02:56.438
that we will never, ever forget

02:56.440 --> 02:59.742
the sacrifices you made
for your country.

03:04.414 --> 03:06.665
(blowing note

03:20.981 --> 03:23.849
I gotta tell you, Pearl Harbor
Day, it always gets to me.

03:23.851 --> 03:25.184
Every year.

03:25.186 --> 03:27.102
Every single one of these
veterans here today,

03:27.104 --> 03:29.989
they are the definition
of the word "hero."

03:29.991 --> 03:31.857
They experienced
all the horrors of war,

03:31.859 --> 03:34.243
and then they come home,
they drop their duffel bags off,

03:34.245 --> 03:36.579
and they go back to work
supporting their families

03:36.581 --> 03:38.197
the next day like
nothing ever happened.

03:38.199 --> 03:40.082
They certainly
set the bar high.

03:40.084 --> 03:41.450
Amazing.

03:49.543 --> 03:50.926
Hey!

03:57.517 --> 03:58.851
What the hell are you doing?

03:58.853 --> 04:03.022

04:53.074 --> 04:55.991
Tried to shoot one of the
veterans at the Memorial today.

04:57.393 --> 04:59.244
Mr. Toriyama, where'd
you get this gun?

04:59.246 --> 05:01.563
It was my service weapon.

05:01.565 --> 05:03.749
And you can call me David.

05:04.868 --> 05:06.669
You're a veteran, David?

05:06.671 --> 05:08.253
Korean War.

05:16.046 --> 05:17.596
Did these come with this?

05:19.132 --> 05:21.383
You realize if you
pulled the trigger,

05:21.385 --> 05:22.551
this thing would
have malfunctioned,

05:22.553 --> 05:24.252
probably blown up
in your face.

05:24.254 --> 05:26.055
Then maybe you
shouldn't have stopped me.

05:27.691 --> 05:30.643
You said your name is McGarrett?

05:30.645 --> 05:32.961
Hasn't changed since the
last time you asked me.

05:32.963 --> 05:34.096
Have we met before?

05:34.098 --> 05:36.315
No, I don't think so.

05:36.317 --> 05:39.118
I know you from somewhere.

05:41.705 --> 05:43.288
Sir.

05:43.290 --> 05:45.374
Sir, you said Ezra Clark
killed you father.

05:45.376 --> 05:46.659
How do you know that?

05:46.661 --> 05:48.077
I was there.

05:48.079 --> 05:51.046
That man is a murderer
and a thief.

05:51.048 --> 05:52.481
He dishonored my family

05:52.483 --> 05:54.717
and he dishonors
the United States military.

05:54.719 --> 05:56.552
Okay, you know what?
Take it easy.

05:56.554 --> 05:57.803
All right?

05:57.805 --> 05:59.638
They're some serious charges.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.890
Ezra Clark
is a decorated soldier.

06:03.510 --> 06:05.678
Now, if he killed your father,
why wasn't he prosecuted?

06:05.680 --> 06:10.182
Son, if you know
anything about World War II,

06:10.184 --> 06:13.602
you'd know that a Japanese
accusing a white soldier

06:13.604 --> 06:17.639
of a crime-- any crime--
would never be taken seriously.

06:20.326 --> 06:22.077
Okay, what about after the war?

06:22.079 --> 06:23.445
I tried.

06:23.447 --> 06:25.948
But the police said
there wasn't enough evidence

06:25.950 --> 06:27.916
to open an investigation.

06:27.918 --> 06:30.786
Okay, when did this
alleged crime take place?

06:30.788 --> 06:33.205
May 24, 1943.

06:33.207 --> 06:35.791
Approximately 3:15
in the afternoon.

06:38.511 --> 06:41.296
Why would Ezra Clark
kill your father?

06:41.298 --> 06:42.765
Our <i>katana.</i>

06:42.767 --> 06:46.435
Ezra Clark
shot my father for it.

06:48.171 --> 06:49.388
A samurai sword.

06:49.390 --> 06:50.856
That's right.

06:50.858 --> 06:53.776
And it belonged
to my family for centuries,

06:53.778 --> 06:56.678
passed down from generation
to generation.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.680
If what you're
telling us is true,

06:58.682 --> 07:00.699
why are you going
after Clark now?

07:00.701 --> 07:05.320
My wife passed away
20 years ago.

07:05.322 --> 07:10.909
And in August, my only child
died in a car accident.

07:10.911 --> 07:13.662
I couldn't dishonor them
while they were alive,

07:13.664 --> 07:17.499
but now, finding justice
is all I have left.

07:28.211 --> 07:30.712
Excuse me, David.

07:36.152 --> 07:39.154
So, uh, what do you think?
You believe him?

07:39.156 --> 07:40.522
Why would he lie?

07:40.524 --> 07:43.058
I don't know. Um...

07:43.060 --> 07:45.327
it was a long time ago,
what he's talking about, right?

07:45.329 --> 07:46.945
This guy served his country.

07:46.947 --> 07:49.281
All right? We owe it to him
to find the truth.

07:49.283 --> 07:50.449
If that is the truth,

07:50.451 --> 07:52.785
it's been buried
for about 70 years.

07:52.787 --> 07:54.169
Last time I checked,

07:54.171 --> 07:56.839
there's no statute
of limitations for murder.

08:07.740 --> 08:13.211
<i>Our life on the island</i>
<i>was beautiful before the war.</i>

08:15.332 --> 08:20.336
<i>I was ten,</i>
<i>and my brother Kenji was 17.</i>

08:20.338 --> 08:22.504
<i>He was a great student,</i>

08:22.506 --> 08:25.891
<i>terrific athlete and my hero.</i>

08:25.893 --> 08:27.810
Hey, who do you like best,

08:27.812 --> 08:30.479
Joe DiMaggio or Hank Greenberg?

08:30.481 --> 08:32.347
Are you kidding me?
It's like asking me

08:32.350 --> 08:33.631
what's better,
chocolate or strawberry.

08:33.634 --> 08:36.150
You know, they're both great, right?
Yeah.

08:36.153 --> 08:38.070
Hello, boys!
Mrs. Kennedy!

08:38.072 --> 08:42.274
<i>We lived in a house on Damon</i>
<i>Street in the Manoa Valley.</i>

08:42.275 --> 08:43.609
Leave that outside.

08:43.611 --> 08:48.464
<i>Everybody knew us,</i>
<i>and we knew them.</i>

08:48.466 --> 08:49.415
Kenji, you're looking
really sharp out there.

08:49.417 --> 08:50.666
A lot better than
last year.

08:50.668 --> 08:52.484
Thanks, Dad.

08:52.486 --> 08:56.038
<i>My father James taught</i>
<i>history at Punahou School,</i>

08:56.040 --> 08:57.823
<i>a 100-year-old institution.</i>

08:57.825 --> 08:59.758
<i>It's where</i>
<i>President Obama went.</i>

08:59.760 --> 09:04.513
<i>My mother Martha</i>
<i>was very civic-minded:</i>

09:04.515 --> 09:08.183
<i>active in the PTA</i>
<i>and community theater.</i>

09:08.185 --> 09:09.385
She also worked for her father,

09:09.387 --> 09:12.054
<i>who was a Hawaiian</i>
<i>territorial senator.</i>

09:12.056 --> 09:14.139
All right, let's get
down to business.

09:14.141 --> 09:16.842
Topic of the day:

09:16.844 --> 09:18.510
If you could invent one thing

09:18.512 --> 09:21.897
to make your everyday life
easier, what would it be?

09:21.899 --> 09:25.067
Oh, I got this. That's easy.

09:25.069 --> 09:27.703
Kenji would want a machine
that makes girlfriends.

09:28.689 --> 09:30.239
Well, David's
gonna build a robot

09:30.241 --> 09:32.708
that cleans his room
and takes out the trash.

09:32.710 --> 09:33.859
You boys.

09:33.861 --> 09:35.544
That's a good one, too.

09:35.546 --> 09:37.629
David, eat your vegetables.

09:37.631 --> 09:39.548
They're not so bad.

09:39.550 --> 09:41.834
Listen to you mother;
she's always right.

09:44.637 --> 09:48.206
Our neighborhood
was a special place.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.759
A big melting pot.

09:50.761 --> 09:55.881
There was never any trouble;
all of us got along great.

09:59.102 --> 10:01.070
But then everything changed

10:01.072 --> 10:03.272
on December 7th.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.005
<i>In the weeks that followed,</i>

10:20.007 --> 10:26.045
the military began arresting
prominent Japanese:

10:26.047 --> 10:30.049
teachers, bankers, lawyers,

10:30.051 --> 10:34.103
Buddhist priests,
newspaper editors,

10:34.105 --> 10:37.356
and our community leaders.

10:38.691 --> 10:42.478
I'll never forget the day
they came for my family.

10:46.399 --> 10:49.985
President Lincoln's speech in
Springfield was like a prophecy.

10:49.987 --> 10:53.322
He warned of the tragic
consequences of a civil war.

10:53.324 --> 10:57.943
He said, "A house divided
against itself cannot stand."

10:57.945 --> 10:59.461
Are you James Toriyama?

10:59.463 --> 11:01.446
Y-Yes.

11:01.448 --> 11:02.581
You're under arrest.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.833
Under arrest?
What's the meaning of this?

11:04.835 --> 11:07.119
What... On what charges?
What's going on here?

11:07.121 --> 11:09.171
Why am I being arrested?!

11:15.895 --> 11:18.647
Who are you?
What do you want?

11:18.649 --> 11:19.798
You're being detained

11:19.800 --> 11:21.401
by order of the
United States Government.

11:21.402 --> 11:23.018
On what charge?

11:23.020 --> 11:25.154
Mind your manners, Jap.

11:25.156 --> 11:27.072
Now you got two minutes
to get your things together.

11:27.074 --> 11:28.640
Only take what you can carry.

11:28.642 --> 11:29.708
You can't do this.

11:29.710 --> 11:31.443
We're American citizens!
We have ri--

11:31.445 --> 11:32.444
No! No...

11:32.446 --> 11:34.196
Now you got one minute.

11:36.116 --> 11:37.583
Hurry, boys.

11:37.585 --> 11:39.418
Do what he says.

11:44.657 --> 11:46.375
What about our house

11:46.377 --> 11:47.759
and the rest of our things?

11:47.761 --> 11:49.011
Anything that
you can't carry

11:49.013 --> 11:51.329
is now property of the
United States Government.

11:51.331 --> 11:52.931
And if I were you,

11:52.933 --> 11:55.934
I'd get going.

12:30.803 --> 12:32.921
Come on, lady... let's go!

12:32.923 --> 12:34.640
That's right, keep walking!

12:34.642 --> 12:36.091
Over here!
Get in line1

12:36.093 --> 12:37.226
Take a seat!

12:37.228 --> 12:38.510
You, move over!

12:38.512 --> 12:40.729
That's right,
there's room for everybody.

12:40.731 --> 12:43.015
James! James!

12:43.017 --> 12:43.982
Martha?

12:43.984 --> 12:44.850
James!

12:44.852 --> 12:46.235
Martha...

12:46.237 --> 12:48.187
Martha!
Over here!

12:48.189 --> 12:50.105
Martha!

12:55.912 --> 12:58.030
Get in line!

12:58.032 --> 12:59.397
Are you all right?

12:59.399 --> 13:00.832
I'm okay.

13:02.869 --> 13:03.669
It's okay, son.

13:03.671 --> 13:05.370
We're together now.

13:05.372 --> 13:06.588
Move it. Let's go.

13:06.590 --> 13:09.074
Let's go.
Let's do what he says.

13:12.512 --> 13:14.412
<i>I was only ten,</i>

13:14.414 --> 13:17.099
<i>but I'll never</i>
<i>forget that humiliation.</i>

13:19.435 --> 13:22.054
<i>Paraded like P.O.W.'s</i>

13:22.056 --> 13:26.058
<i>in front of friends and</i>
<i>neighbors we had grown up with.</i>

13:26.060 --> 13:29.111
<i>And we were as American</i>
<i>as they were.</i>

13:36.536 --> 13:40.906
They kept us in jail
for a while...

13:40.908 --> 13:43.575
until we were relocated

13:43.577 --> 13:49.081
to a camp outside a gulch
in Waipahu.

13:50.333 --> 13:54.503
Its name was Honouliuli
Internment Camp,

13:54.505 --> 13:57.923
but we called it "Hell Valley"

13:57.925 --> 14:00.976
<i>because it was so damn hot.</i>

14:02.512 --> 14:05.397
<i>And it wasn't a camp at all.</i>

14:05.399 --> 14:07.299
<i>It was more like a prison.</i>

14:07.301 --> 14:09.634
Guard towers and searchlights.

14:09.636 --> 14:11.486
<i>There was barbed wire.</i>

14:11.488 --> 14:15.807
<i>Armed soldiers patrolled</i>
<i>the perimeters</i>

14:15.809 --> 14:19.695
<i>and would shoot anyone</i>
<i>trying to escape.</i>

14:19.697 --> 14:24.032
<i>We just couldn't get over</i>
<i>the shock of being imprisoned.</i>

14:27.804 --> 14:30.956
<i>Everybody lost their homes</i>
<i>and businesses.</i>

14:30.958 --> 14:33.809
Boys, why don't you take
those two over there?

14:36.262 --> 14:37.929
Take that one.

14:41.601 --> 14:43.885
We were looked upon as traitors

14:43.887 --> 14:45.437
in our own country.

14:45.439 --> 14:47.189
But let me tell you something:

14:47.191 --> 14:51.443
during the entire war, there was
not one single incident

14:51.445 --> 14:54.896
of treason ever committed
by Japanese-Americans!

14:54.898 --> 14:55.947
Not a one!

15:00.119 --> 15:02.287
<i>So, apparently, David Toriyama</i>

15:02.289 --> 15:03.655
is who he says he is.

15:03.657 --> 15:06.524
He's a widower,
no surviving family,

15:06.526 --> 15:07.609
taught for 25 years

15:07.611 --> 15:09.294
in the public
school system.

15:09.296 --> 15:10.295
And yes,

15:10.297 --> 15:11.529
when he was a kid,

15:11.531 --> 15:13.498
he was an internee
at Honouliuli.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.967
Service record?

15:15.969 --> 15:17.636
Well, it's pretty
impressive, actually.

15:17.638 --> 15:19.671
He served in Korea
and was personally cited

15:19.673 --> 15:22.641
by Douglas MacArthur for bravery
at the battle of Inchon.

15:26.429 --> 15:29.547
Okay. Um...

15:29.549 --> 15:30.599
what about his father?

15:30.601 --> 15:32.717
Anything on him--
James Toriyama?

15:32.719 --> 15:34.436
Well, here's where
the information conflicts

15:34.438 --> 15:35.854
with what David told us.

15:35.856 --> 15:39.191
Now, camp operations
was under the jurisdiction

15:39.193 --> 15:40.742
of the Army Provost
Marshal General,

15:40.744 --> 15:42.727
but the official
camp history is in

15:42.729 --> 15:44.830
the National Archives.
I was able to access it,

15:44.832 --> 15:47.199
and I found only one reference
to a James Toriyama.

15:48.951 --> 15:53.088
He was killed by a fellow
internee in May of 1943.

15:59.595 --> 16:01.763
David, as it turns out,

16:01.765 --> 16:05.634
your father was killed during
a fight with another internee.

16:05.636 --> 16:07.519
Where did you learn that?

16:07.521 --> 16:09.304
From the official record.

16:10.474 --> 16:12.924
That might be
the official record,

16:12.926 --> 16:14.259
but it's not the truth.

16:14.261 --> 16:16.278
So you're saying
there was a cover-up?

16:16.280 --> 16:18.363
What have I been
telling you?

16:18.365 --> 16:21.900
My father was murdered by a GI

16:21.902 --> 16:25.670
and it was buried
because he was Japanese!

16:30.710 --> 16:32.077
Yeah, Danny.

16:32.079 --> 16:34.713
I got a hit on Ezra Clark.

16:34.715 --> 16:36.381
Pulled up juvenile record.

16:36.383 --> 16:37.716
Apparently, this guy had

16:37.718 --> 16:39.784
a permanent spot
on Santa's naughty list.

16:39.786 --> 16:41.052
All right, give me
the highlights.

16:41.054 --> 16:42.921
Okay. He was considered
a troubled youth

16:42.923 --> 16:44.756
with years of repeat offenses

16:44.758 --> 16:46.458
and a tendency
toward violent behavior.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.310
Last case he caught,
he got into a beef,

16:48.312 --> 16:49.811
broke a bottle
over a kid's face,

16:49.813 --> 16:52.797
cut him up pretty good.
Judge labeled him high risk.

16:52.799 --> 16:55.350
Gave him two choices:
the army or jail.

16:55.352 --> 16:58.153
Looks like he might get
the chance to experience both.

16:58.155 --> 17:01.440
Leave! Before I call the cops!

17:03.359 --> 17:05.694
Uh, sir, we <i>are</i> the cops.

17:05.695 --> 17:08.696
I never heard
of Five-O.

17:08.699 --> 17:10.582
Okay, uh,
how about here--

17:10.584 --> 17:12.501
I'll show you
my badge again.

17:12.502 --> 17:13.702
Son, are you implying

17:13.704 --> 17:15.036
I can't see or read?

17:15.038 --> 17:16.154
No, of course not.

17:16.156 --> 17:17.539
I'm sorry.
I just figured

17:17.540 --> 17:19.007
you'd remember us
from this morning.

17:19.009 --> 17:20.925
Well, I don't!

17:20.928 --> 17:24.679
Mr. Clark, we just want
to get some answers, that's all.

17:24.681 --> 17:27.898
Ma'am, no offense,
but I don't care for the police,

17:27.901 --> 17:29.501
so unless you're here
for some other reason,

17:29.503 --> 17:32.304
I suggest you get the hell
out of my house!

17:32.306 --> 17:33.355
Yeah, we will

17:33.357 --> 17:35.106
as soon as we're done
talking to you.

17:35.108 --> 17:38.393
You were a guard
at the Honouliuli camp.

17:38.395 --> 17:41.062
You remember a family--
the Toriyama family--

17:41.064 --> 17:42.898
specifically, a James Toriyama?

17:42.900 --> 17:46.318
James Tori... what? Seriously?

17:46.320 --> 17:48.353
I can't remember
what I had for breakfast,

17:48.355 --> 17:50.855
let alone some Jap
from 70 years ago.

17:50.857 --> 17:53.458
Yeah, 'cause they all
look alike, right?

17:53.460 --> 17:56.628
That's what we called
the enemy back then.

17:56.630 --> 17:59.548
There's nothing
between the lines!

17:59.550 --> 18:01.833
Okay, well, when you say it,
it sounds personal.

18:01.835 --> 18:03.218
I'm just saying.

18:03.220 --> 18:04.302
Listen to me.

18:04.304 --> 18:07.005
We were at war.

18:07.007 --> 18:09.174
Those people were our enemies!

18:09.176 --> 18:12.844
What were "those people""
to you before the war?

18:12.846 --> 18:13.979
Get out!

18:13.981 --> 18:14.980
One more question:

18:14.982 --> 18:17.148
Did you kill
James Toriyama?

18:17.150 --> 18:18.266
That's why you're here?

18:18.268 --> 18:19.684
To accuse me of murder?

18:19.686 --> 18:20.902
Answer the question.

18:20.904 --> 18:23.822
Did you kill James Toriyama
and steal his <i>katana?</i>

18:23.824 --> 18:27.943
No. Now get out
before I lose my temper!

18:27.945 --> 18:29.611
Dad?

18:29.613 --> 18:32.247
Are you all right?

18:33.732 --> 18:35.567
What's going on?

18:35.569 --> 18:40.038
It's okay, honey.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.424
My daughter Linda.

18:42.426 --> 18:46.261
Kinda takes the wind right out
of your sails, doesn't it?

18:46.263 --> 18:48.296
If I hated
the Japanese so much,

18:48.298 --> 18:51.016
why would I have
married one?

19:03.622 --> 19:05.523
Mr. Toriyama?

19:06.658 --> 19:07.725
Can I help you?

19:07.727 --> 19:08.893
Uh, just came in

19:08.895 --> 19:10.328
to see if you
needed anything.

19:10.330 --> 19:11.596
You okay?

19:11.598 --> 19:14.799
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

19:14.801 --> 19:18.669
If I may, sir, I'd like
to shake your hand.

19:21.006 --> 19:23.341
You do know I was going

19:23.343 --> 19:26.677
to murder a man today.

19:26.679 --> 19:29.147
You were a soldier.

19:29.149 --> 19:30.598
You know guns.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.652
I think you know your
weapon wasn't going to fire.

19:35.737 --> 19:38.856
I think you went to Pearl Harbor
today to make a point,

19:38.858 --> 19:41.025
not kill a man.

19:45.164 --> 19:46.531
What's your name, son?

19:46.533 --> 19:48.032
Chin Ho Kelly.

19:48.034 --> 19:49.033
Korean?

19:49.035 --> 19:50.234
It's in the mix.

19:50.236 --> 19:51.836
A little Japanese
as well.

19:51.838 --> 19:54.038
In fact, I had
an uncle who spent

19:54.040 --> 19:56.040
some time at the
Sand Island camp.

19:59.411 --> 20:01.745
You have a family, son?

20:01.747 --> 20:03.381
Not yet.

20:03.383 --> 20:05.216
When you do...

20:06.435 --> 20:09.187
...make sure you
tell your children

20:09.189 --> 20:10.771
what happened us.

20:10.773 --> 20:13.307
They must never forget.

20:18.930 --> 20:21.199
If you need anything at all,
just let me know.

20:21.201 --> 20:26.320
Excuse me.
Thank you.

20:28.241 --> 20:29.824
Ezra Clark give you anything?

20:29.826 --> 20:30.791
Besides attitude?

20:30.793 --> 20:32.076
Not much.

20:32.078 --> 20:33.411
Well, the medications
he's taking

20:33.413 --> 20:36.130
is for treatment
of Alzheimer's and dementia.

20:36.132 --> 20:38.466
My Aunt Lois
is on the same pill regimen,

20:38.468 --> 20:40.618
so it's possible,
depending on what stage he's in,

20:40.620 --> 20:42.803
he might not even really
remember whether or not

20:42.805 --> 20:43.954
he killed David's father.

20:43.956 --> 20:46.674
It's also possible
he has selective memory.

20:46.676 --> 20:48.226
Some of those guards
at those camps

20:48.228 --> 20:49.510
weren't exactly known
for their humanity.

20:49.512 --> 20:51.062
In fact, there were
plenty of cases

20:51.064 --> 20:52.630
where internees were
actually killed by them,

20:52.632 --> 20:54.515
allegedly for resisting orders.

20:54.517 --> 20:56.467
Hey, what are we
gonna do about

20:56.469 --> 20:57.968
Mr. Toriyama?
We can't keep him here.

21:17.422 --> 21:21.175
I still don't understand.

21:21.177 --> 21:23.494
How come I'm not under arrest?

21:23.496 --> 21:24.995
Who says you're not?

21:24.997 --> 21:26.830
I'm placing you under
house arrest, all right?

21:26.832 --> 21:29.517
You're to stay here
until we get to the bottom of it.

21:29.519 --> 21:33.437
You're going
to investigate my case?

21:34.973 --> 21:37.525
Yes, I am. That's my job.

21:37.527 --> 21:41.228
But there's one thing
I need from you:

21:41.230 --> 21:43.781
Soldier to soldier...

21:43.783 --> 21:46.233
I need your word that
you're telling me the truth.

21:46.235 --> 21:48.235
I am.

21:48.237 --> 21:49.320
Okay.

21:49.322 --> 21:51.572
That's good enough for me.

21:51.574 --> 21:52.623
Thank you.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.024
No, don't thank me yet.

21:54.026 --> 21:56.360
You got a picture
of that stolen <i>katana?</i>

22:00.716 --> 22:02.550
That's my mother.

22:06.338 --> 22:09.807
Ah, and here's my father.

22:11.210 --> 22:12.510
Who's this soldier?

22:12.512 --> 22:15.313
That's my brother Kenji.

22:15.315 --> 22:18.482
He didn't want to
stay in the camp

22:18.484 --> 22:20.318
so he enlisted.

22:20.320 --> 22:25.573
Many of the Nisei
his age did the same.

22:25.575 --> 22:28.409
He was in a unit
that was composed

22:28.411 --> 22:31.612
mostly of Japanese-Americans--

22:31.614 --> 22:34.582
the 442nd Regimental
Combat Team.

22:34.584 --> 22:37.084
Yeah, the 442nd Purple
Heart Battalion.

22:37.086 --> 22:40.421
They were the most
decorated infantry unit

22:40.423 --> 22:42.423
in the, in the history
of the United States Army.

22:42.425 --> 22:43.574
Their motto was "Go For Broke."

22:43.576 --> 22:46.544
Good to know
you weren't sleeping

22:46.546 --> 22:49.046
in your Annapolis class
during that lesson.

22:50.633 --> 22:53.551
What happened to Kenji?

22:53.553 --> 22:55.919
Uh...

22:55.921 --> 22:58.305
Killed in action.

22:58.307 --> 23:00.808
Italy.

23:03.311 --> 23:05.146
Not a day goes by

23:05.148 --> 23:07.398
that I don't miss my brother.

23:10.318 --> 23:13.937
Ah, here's the sword.

23:16.408 --> 23:17.775
Beautiful.

23:17.777 --> 23:19.043
Yes.

23:19.828 --> 23:21.779
Brilliant piece
of craftsmanship

23:21.781 --> 23:23.714
from the Koto Era.

23:23.716 --> 23:25.449
Up until that time,

23:25.451 --> 23:29.303
<i>katana</i> were regarded
as evil and ugly.

23:29.305 --> 23:32.923
But swords like this
were considered

23:32.925 --> 23:34.975
deeply spiritual,

23:34.977 --> 23:37.845
pure and benevolent.

23:39.514 --> 23:43.517
There's, um... there's
an inscription in it.

23:43.519 --> 23:45.019
Ah.

23:45.021 --> 23:47.571
"Heaven favors the strong

23:47.573 --> 23:49.740
and the just."

23:53.028 --> 23:55.112
Mr. Toriyama, I'd like to borrow
this photograph, please.

23:55.114 --> 23:57.865
I'd like to run it
through a crime database

23:57.867 --> 23:59.250
of stolen artifacts,

23:59.252 --> 24:02.620
see if your sword has popped up
anywhere in the last 70 years.

24:02.622 --> 24:04.038
Yes, of course.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.257
Thanks.

24:25.193 --> 24:26.310
Steve?

24:26.312 --> 24:29.313
That's my grandfather.

24:29.315 --> 24:31.482
This man right here
is my grandfather.

24:31.484 --> 24:32.683
What is he doing
in your family album?

24:32.685 --> 24:33.851
I don't know.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.402
What's his name?

24:35.404 --> 24:38.021
He-he looks like
he was in the Navy.

24:38.023 --> 24:39.573
His name was Steven McGarrett.
He was an ensign.

24:39.575 --> 24:40.908
And he served on the <i>Arizona.</i>

24:40.910 --> 24:43.661
And he died in the attack
on Pearl Harbor.

24:43.663 --> 24:47.581
I'm sorry.

25:01.596 --> 25:03.264
Well, I'd like to state,
for the record,

25:03.266 --> 25:04.715
that I am confused.

25:04.717 --> 25:06.817
We got an old guy
with a gun

25:06.819 --> 25:09.219
who made a premeditated decision
to kill somebody.

25:09.221 --> 25:10.721
And we don't lock him up,

25:10.723 --> 25:12.556
instead we, uh,
we run errands for him.

25:12.558 --> 25:13.524
is isn't a street crime.

25:13.526 --> 25:15.025
And it's not about money.

25:15.027 --> 25:16.193
This case is about honor.

25:16.195 --> 25:18.078
His method, it was wrong.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.229
I don't condone it.

25:19.231 --> 25:21.031
But we owe it to him to,

25:21.033 --> 25:22.867
at the very least,
investigate.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.085
Okay, I see what's happening.
You know what you're becoming, right?

25:25.087 --> 25:26.704
Bet you're gonna
tell me, aren't you?

25:26.706 --> 25:27.671
A big softie.

25:27.673 --> 25:29.623
I was right.

25:29.625 --> 25:31.592
With a bleeding heart,
which somehow you now have.

25:31.594 --> 25:33.177
I mean, I don't know, maybe...

25:33.179 --> 25:36.413
maybe you're becoming
a human being, Steve.

25:48.777 --> 25:51.228
Welcome.

25:51.230 --> 25:54.532
So, this is where the Army
stores all its old MP records.

25:54.534 --> 25:56.116
How old is "old"?

25:56.118 --> 25:58.235
Well, the military's
been in Hawaii

25:58.237 --> 25:59.670
since the McKinley Era--

25:59.672 --> 26:01.872
that's what? 120 years.

26:01.874 --> 26:03.824
Oh, that's good.
We can go find King Tut.

26:07.430 --> 26:09.713
Please, after you.

26:15.754 --> 26:17.621
Hey.
Huh?

26:17.623 --> 26:19.122
Come on.

26:19.124 --> 26:22.893
Uh, you know, uh, how I feel
about cramped spaces like this.

26:22.895 --> 26:23.928
I'll hold your hand, come on.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.396
Hey, claustrophobia is not

26:25.398 --> 26:26.897
something you make
fun of, Steve, okay?

26:26.899 --> 26:27.932
We'll hold a telethon.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.233
Come on.

26:29.235 --> 26:30.234
You're a jerk, you know that?

26:30.236 --> 26:31.518
Let's go.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.270
What is that sound?

26:33.272 --> 26:34.521
Is that rain?

26:34.523 --> 26:37.491
It's rats.
You could've lied.

26:37.493 --> 26:39.243
Looks like these are
all tagged by year.

26:39.245 --> 26:41.812
Looking for 1943.

26:41.814 --> 26:44.031
Yeah, I'm in the '60s here.

26:46.751 --> 26:48.202
'57.

26:49.537 --> 26:51.121
Right here.

26:51.123 --> 26:53.207
'43-- I got it.

26:53.209 --> 26:54.842
Let's see what we got.

27:02.050 --> 27:03.300
Nice little rat condo?

27:03.302 --> 27:07.004
Yeah. All right, January.

27:07.006 --> 27:09.974
February... come on.

27:09.976 --> 27:13.060
And May, here we go.

27:14.362 --> 27:16.981
Uh, they're MP daily reports,

27:16.983 --> 27:18.532
duty logs...

27:18.534 --> 27:20.534
What is that?

27:20.536 --> 27:21.986
It's an S.I.R.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.186
What's an S.I.R.?

27:23.188 --> 27:24.855
A "Serious Incident Report."

27:24.857 --> 27:26.657
The writing's
pretty faded.

27:26.659 --> 27:28.709
Yeah, but look right
there-- it says May 24.

27:28.711 --> 27:31.078
That's the time the old man
said the murder took place.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.329
All right, pack all this up.

27:32.331 --> 27:33.998
Get everything back to the lab.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.032
Everything?

27:35.034 --> 27:36.216
Everything.

27:37.836 --> 27:39.169
<i>Here it is.</i>

27:39.171 --> 27:42.205
"Type of criminal activity--

27:42.207 --> 27:43.557
"murder by shooting.

27:43.559 --> 27:45.592
"Victim's name--

27:45.594 --> 27:47.061
James Toriyama."

27:49.380 --> 27:52.733
This looks like the,
uh, witness report.

27:52.735 --> 27:54.601
Th's interesting.

27:54.603 --> 27:58.656
Uh, Ezra Clark is a witness,
not, uh, an offender.

27:58.658 --> 27:59.857
All right, page three.

27:59.859 --> 28:02.409
Where's the rest of it?
That's all there is.

28:02.411 --> 28:03.744
What do you mean
that's all there is?

28:03.746 --> 28:05.562
There's no description
of the actual events.

28:05.564 --> 28:07.614
Maybe it ended up,
uh, rat kibble.

28:07.616 --> 28:09.333
I don't think so.

28:09.335 --> 28:11.201
You see this jagged tear mark?

28:11.203 --> 28:14.004
It's longer than the others
and discolored along the edges.

28:14.006 --> 28:15.706
I think it was torn off.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.343
All right, go back
to, uh, page one.

28:19.345 --> 28:20.878
Let's see if we can work out
who wrote this.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.212
There.

28:22.214 --> 28:24.081
"George, George P.""

28:24.083 --> 28:25.466
Is that a P?
It's "George P."

28:25.468 --> 28:27.468
It's good, all we got
to do is find George P.

28:27.470 --> 28:29.386
if he's alive, and maybe
he can tell us what happened.

28:29.388 --> 28:30.721
And if that page is
just missing

28:30.723 --> 28:32.056
or it was actually
torn out deliberately.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.107
If that's the case,

28:33.109 --> 28:35.142
David Toriyama was right.

28:35.144 --> 28:37.311
This was a cover-up.

29:17.868 --> 29:19.302
Yeah, Danny.

29:19.304 --> 29:20.937
Ho, what are you doing?
Where are you?

29:20.939 --> 29:21.938
I'm at the house.

29:21.940 --> 29:22.939
I'm just going through some

29:22.941 --> 29:23.873
of my grandfather's stuff.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.591
Seeing if I can find
a connection

29:25.593 --> 29:27.310
to David Toriyama.

29:27.312 --> 29:28.460
And?

29:28.462 --> 29:30.763
Nothing yet. What about you?

29:30.765 --> 29:32.298
I reached out
to the Pentagon

29:32.300 --> 29:34.100
and all the veterans
organizations.

29:34.102 --> 29:35.852
As far as I can tell,
there was no one

29:35.854 --> 29:38.354
in the Honouliuli MP unit
with the name George P.

29:38.356 --> 29:40.039
Yeah, and I had
Catherine ask David.

29:40.041 --> 29:41.774
He said he never heard
of the guy either.

29:41.776 --> 29:43.326
The name had to come
from somewhere.

29:43.328 --> 29:45.161
Hey, you get any hits
on the sword

29:45.163 --> 29:46.496
from the stolen
artifacts database?

29:46.498 --> 29:48.331
Nothing.

29:48.333 --> 29:51.167
Okay, so that means it could
still be with the person

29:51.169 --> 29:52.752
who stole it and then
killed James Toriyama.

29:52.754 --> 29:55.338
Right now, Ezra Clark.

29:55.340 --> 29:56.589
Yeah, that's what David thinks.

29:56.591 --> 29:58.791
Except, after 70 years,
memories fade,

29:58.793 --> 30:01.427
and David might not be
remembering all the details.

30:01.429 --> 30:03.513
You know what we need to do?

30:03.515 --> 30:05.715
We need to jar his memory.

30:58.718 --> 31:01.404
The main guard tower was here.

31:03.273 --> 31:06.776
An American soldier sat up there

31:06.778 --> 31:10.396
behind a 30-caliber
machine gun.

31:10.398 --> 31:13.732
Someone was watching
our every move.

31:31.351 --> 31:34.420
This is where my mother
had her garden.

31:34.422 --> 31:37.940
The ground was so sandy.

31:37.942 --> 31:41.944
She could only grow
root vegetables--

31:41.946 --> 31:44.563
parsnips, carrots,

31:44.565 --> 31:46.699
radishes.

31:59.946 --> 32:02.965
And this is where she collapsed

32:02.967 --> 32:04.917
when we got the news

32:04.919 --> 32:07.920
that Kenji had been killed
in Italy.

32:10.007 --> 32:12.174
Listen.

32:13.877 --> 32:16.228
Can you hear her cry?

32:18.482 --> 32:20.650
I still can.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.618
Here.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.788
Right here.

32:42.790 --> 32:46.042
This is the place.

32:46.044 --> 32:48.210
This is where we lived.

32:54.434 --> 32:56.135
<i>David!</i>

32:59.606 --> 33:01.774
Nice throw, son.

33:12.018 --> 33:13.486
David, stay here.

33:13.488 --> 33:15.654
I'll be right back.

33:44.067 --> 33:46.235
<i>Are you sure, David?</i>

33:46.237 --> 33:49.021
<i>That Ezra Clark</i>
<i>pulled that trigger?</i>

33:49.023 --> 33:51.741
I've thought about that face

33:51.743 --> 33:55.444
every day for the last 70 years.

33:57.497 --> 34:00.282
So David was here,

34:00.284 --> 34:02.067
25 yards away
from the tents.

34:02.069 --> 34:03.953
And according to
Ezra Clark's statement,

34:03.955 --> 34:06.756
he was posted here,
just 10 yards away.

34:06.758 --> 34:08.007
Well, David said

34:08.009 --> 34:10.176
he responded to the sound
of a gunshot, right?

34:10.178 --> 34:11.793
He goes in, he finds
his father on the floor

34:11.795 --> 34:13.763
bleeding from
a head wound.

34:13.764 --> 34:14.746
All right, well,
Ezra had the means,

34:14.748 --> 34:16.215
he had the opportunity.

34:16.217 --> 34:17.632
Wait a second, though.

34:17.635 --> 34:19.552
If Ezra stole the sword,
why would he stick around?

34:19.554 --> 34:22.054
And no one, not even David,
said that he had it on him.

34:22.056 --> 34:24.139
Well, maybe he stashed it
and came back and got it later.

34:24.141 --> 34:26.025
Or maybe Ezra
didn't kill James.

34:26.027 --> 34:27.893
Maybe he was responding
to the same gunshot

34:27.895 --> 34:29.145
that David heard.

34:29.147 --> 34:31.197
He went in, got blood on himself
trying to revive him.

34:34.068 --> 34:35.650
Charlie,
what do you got?

34:35.652 --> 34:37.937
I used a forensic laser
on the incident report

34:37.938 --> 34:40.790
to bring up the
missing signature.

34:40.792 --> 34:43.324
The first name
is definitely "George"

34:43.327 --> 34:46.277
but the last name
did not start with "P,"

34:46.280 --> 34:48.414
as we originally thought.

34:48.416 --> 34:49.547
It's an "R."

34:49.550 --> 34:51.750
The diagonal stroke was missing.

34:51.752 --> 34:53.636
Guy you're looking for

34:53.638 --> 34:56.054
is an ex-cop named George Rigby.

34:56.056 --> 34:58.841
Yeah, Dad passed away in '92.

34:58.843 --> 35:01.844
He was with HPD for 30 years.

35:01.846 --> 35:04.346
Moved up the ladder
from beat cop to administration.

35:04.348 --> 35:05.797
What about
World War II?

35:05.799 --> 35:07.817
Well, he was
with homicide.

35:07.819 --> 35:09.735
Even though Hawaii
was under martial law,

35:09.737 --> 35:11.303
they still needed cops,

35:11.305 --> 35:13.489
and Dad was just too old
to be drafted.

35:14.807 --> 35:17.142
Let me help you with that.
Yeah.

35:18.862 --> 35:20.362
Dad always wanted
to be a writer.

35:20.364 --> 35:22.581
That's why he kept
all his case work.

35:22.583 --> 35:24.750
He never got around
to that novel.

35:24.752 --> 35:26.919
If what you're
looking for exists,

35:26.921 --> 35:29.121
it's in here.

35:32.659 --> 35:33.759
I gotta tell you, man,

35:33.761 --> 35:34.960
this guy Rigby
didn't miss a trick.

35:34.962 --> 35:36.145
I mean, he's got notes of

35:36.147 --> 35:39.548
every single crime scene
he was ever on...

35:39.550 --> 35:41.133
the witness
descriptions...

35:41.135 --> 35:42.668
I mean, the details
are incredible.

35:42.670 --> 35:43.853
Hold on, hold on...

35:43.855 --> 35:45.271
What?
This is it.

35:45.273 --> 35:48.557
All right, Ezra Clark's
witness statement.

35:48.559 --> 35:50.526
"I heard a gunshot
and responded.

35:50.528 --> 35:52.611
"Saw a guy run out
the back of the tent.

35:52.613 --> 35:54.029
"He wasn't one of
the camp guards,

35:54.031 --> 35:55.447
but I had seen him
hanging around before."

35:55.449 --> 35:57.015
Well, does he identify the guy?

35:57.017 --> 35:58.617
No, not here.

35:58.619 --> 35:59.785
All right,
keep flipping pages.

35:59.787 --> 36:01.070
I'm telling you,
if Rigby was half the cop

36:01.072 --> 36:02.020
that he seems to be,

36:02.022 --> 36:03.522
he had to run
down that lead.

36:04.791 --> 36:05.857
Got it.

36:05.859 --> 36:08.494
Rigby I.D.'d the guy
as Joseph Archer.

36:08.496 --> 36:10.862
He was the kid brother
of Albert Archer,

36:10.864 --> 36:12.431
who was the head guard
at the camp.

36:12.433 --> 36:13.532
All right.

36:13.534 --> 36:14.533
That explains the missing page.

36:14.535 --> 36:16.969
Joseph commits a murder,

36:16.971 --> 36:19.638
and then Albert rips out
the page of the incident report

36:19.640 --> 36:21.006
to protect his little brother.

36:21.008 --> 36:23.225
Chin, was Joseph a GI?

36:23.227 --> 36:24.310
No, but I'm guessing he must've

36:24.312 --> 36:25.561
paid his brother
a visit at the camp,

36:25.563 --> 36:28.731
and then used his access
to rip off some internees.

36:28.733 --> 36:30.232
What else you got on Archer?

36:30.234 --> 36:32.735
Well, he was in and out
of trouble his whole life.

36:32.737 --> 36:35.905
Mostly petty stuff, uh...
property and auto theft.

36:35.907 --> 36:39.525
Uh, then in 1952,
he graduated to the big time

36:39.527 --> 36:40.693
and was arrested for murder.

36:40.695 --> 36:42.912
He died in Halawa

36:42.914 --> 36:44.396
serving out a life sentence.

36:44.398 --> 36:46.732
We need to run down
that homicide report.

36:46.734 --> 36:47.950
I'm way ahead of you.

36:47.952 --> 36:49.952
The murder weapon was a .38,

36:49.954 --> 36:51.236
and it's still in HPD custody.

36:51.238 --> 36:53.255
All right, they
never did an autopsy

36:53.257 --> 36:54.840
on David's father,

36:54.842 --> 36:57.259
so the bullet could still
be inside his body.

36:57.261 --> 36:59.878
Chin, where was
James Toriyama buried?

37:01.298 --> 37:03.182
There's a little cemetery
near the camp.

37:03.184 --> 37:05.935
Ah, it's no more than
a potter's field.

37:05.937 --> 37:07.937
If we could find that bullet

37:07.939 --> 37:10.606
and match it to that gun,
we've got our killer.

38:21.055 --> 38:23.273
Firing one!

38:38.205 --> 38:40.156
It's a match.

38:43.043 --> 38:44.460
How you doing?
Five-O.

38:44.462 --> 38:46.296
You Thomas Archer?
Yes.

38:46.298 --> 38:47.830
Grandson of
Joseph Archer?

38:47.832 --> 38:49.082
That's right.

38:49.084 --> 38:50.667
Uh, what can I do for you?

38:50.669 --> 38:52.519
You ever seen this?

38:52.521 --> 38:54.554
Sure.

38:54.556 --> 38:55.722
That's my grandpa's sword.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.090
Do you know where it is?

39:11.572 --> 39:13.740
May I?

39:13.742 --> 39:15.391
Is there
something wrong?

39:26.337 --> 39:29.622
Do you have any idea how your
grandfather got this sword?

39:39.533 --> 39:41.584
Where...?

39:41.586 --> 39:43.803
How...?

39:43.805 --> 39:45.388
Mr. Toriyama,

39:45.390 --> 39:48.090
Ezra Clark did not
kill your father.

39:48.092 --> 39:49.592
The man who
pulled the trigger

39:49.594 --> 39:51.561
was named
Joseph Archer.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.029
He was a career
criminal who died

39:53.031 --> 39:55.698
while serving a life sentence
in the penitentiary.

39:57.451 --> 40:00.102
On behalf of the United
States Government,

40:00.104 --> 40:02.622
we'd like to return
this property to you,

40:02.624 --> 40:04.073
its rightful owner...

40:04.992 --> 40:06.942
...and extend our most
humble apologies.

40:20.924 --> 40:22.625
David...

40:22.627 --> 40:24.811
one more thing.

40:38.942 --> 40:40.526
Excuse me.

40:58.328 --> 41:00.513
Sir...

41:01.498 --> 41:04.550
I believe I owe
you an apology.

41:23.037 --> 41:24.787
Thank you.

42:09.149 --> 42:13.252
I remembered why
your grandfather's picture

42:13.254 --> 42:15.538
was in our family photo album.

42:16.340 --> 42:18.591
There was this
young serviceman

42:18.593 --> 42:22.345
who used to come
to our house for tutoring.

42:22.347 --> 42:25.965
He and his wife were about
to have another child

42:25.967 --> 42:28.083
and he wanted better for them,

42:28.085 --> 42:30.303
so he asked my father

42:30.305 --> 42:34.307
to help him prepare for
an officer aptitude test.

42:35.359 --> 42:38.928
For three months,
he would come over after dinner,

42:38.930 --> 42:42.148
and... when he had spare time,

42:42.150 --> 42:44.367
he'd play catch with me.

42:46.937 --> 42:49.856
That man was your grandfather...

42:49.858 --> 42:52.291
Steven McGarrett.

42:54.277 --> 42:56.913
And the last
time I saw him

42:56.915 --> 43:01.300
was December 6, 1941.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.505
The night he gave me this.

43:13.764 --> 43:16.065
It was a gift for...

43:16.067 --> 43:18.901
my father's help.

43:38.372 --> 43:40.590
You have his heart.

43:42.009 --> 43:43.926
That's how I remembered.
