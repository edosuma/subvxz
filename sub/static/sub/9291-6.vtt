00:16.120 --> 00:20.200
- For God's sake, pull yourself together.
- You didn't have to kill her.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.840
Yes, I did. Because you didn't
have the courage to kill her yourself.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.200
Courage? To poison a girl
who did no harm to you at all?

00:27.280 --> 00:31.160
This is my husband Navi.
This is Debbie's mother.

00:31.240 --> 00:35.040
- Is she here?
- " We haven't seen her since yesterday.

00:35.520 --> 00:39.080
Get in the car. Follow her.
Make sure she doesn't go to the police.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.200
- " You're out of here.
- " Chloe.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.320
Don't worry. Driscoll doesn't know
you were helping me.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.240
She doesn't?

00:46.320 --> 00:49.040
I'm the one that got you into this.
I'm not gonna sell you out.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.760
Tell me what I need to know.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.720
Richard, your father
was kidnapped by terrorists.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.440
Our analysis shows that you're hiding
something that might help us find him.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.480
There are people on the outside
looking for us. You cannot give up.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.400
I have to do something while I still can.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.120
This trial is gonna be a spectacle,
broadcast all over the world.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.080
Designed to humiliate
and degrade this country.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.640
There's a gas pipe.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.720
- You've checked out the briefcase?
- It's fine.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.560
I was afraid it might be damaged
in the train crash.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.280
The case is very strong.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.720
Get them out! Now!

01:30.360 --> 01:32.720
Hurry! Open the door, now!

01:33.760 --> 01:35.160
I know you.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.840
She recognised me.
She has to be killed.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.880
- Erin, I'm on site.
- Jack, stand down.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.080
What are you talking about?

01:43.160 --> 01:46.600
The president wants to take out
the building with a missile strike.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.720
- With the secretary and his daughter inside?
- "Yes."

01:49.800 --> 01:54.800
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to clear the area.
Jack, don't go in there alone.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.560
Jack, clear the area!
The building is going to be destroyed.

02:07.600 --> 02:12.600
James Heller, you have been
brought before this court of law

02:12.680 --> 02:15.560
to stand trial as a war criminal.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.920
We will prove to the people of the world
that these crimes against humanity

02:20.000 --> 02:24.440
are the direct result of the policies
initiated by you in your capacity.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.880
Since the true extent of your evil legacy
is immeasurable,

02:34.960 --> 02:40.800
we have done our best to document the acts
witnessed directly by the chosen followers.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.280
Under your orders,
the death squads of America

02:44.360 --> 02:48.320
continue their imperialist crusade
against the true believers.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.840
How long till we're ready
to launch the missile?

02:50.920 --> 02:53.880
Command and control
is locking on target now.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.640
Mr President?
Erin Driscoll on line three.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.480
Mr President, I'm calling to ask you
to abort the missile strike.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.200
- Based on what?
- We are attempting a rescue operation.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.840
I was told the marine strike force
was ten to 20 minutes away.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.520
They are, sir. Jack Bauer went in by himself.

03:25.400 --> 03:30.560
A terrorist group is moments from executing
the secretary of defense in front of the world.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.640
- I cannot allow that to happen.
- I understand, sir.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.320
But if Jack can effect a rescue before that?

03:36.400 --> 03:40.520
In that case, I'll abort the missile strike,
but he's running out of time.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.000
How long does he have, sir?

03:44.840 --> 03:46.480
Seven minutes.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.360
Try and make a sound
and I'll blow your head off.

03:55.480 --> 04:01.640
This is a map of the complex. Where are
they holding the secretary of defense?

04:01.720 --> 04:06.760
I'm either gonna kill you now or you're gonna
tell me where they're staging the trial.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.360
Point. Now. Where's the secretary?

04:23.160 --> 04:25.240
There is no place in this world

04:25.320 --> 04:29.640
where your evil has not scoured
the sacred land of the true word.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.960
Your imperialist legacy
has devoured the lives of the innocent.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.920
- " Jack?"
- Yeah?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.400
- "Keeler won't call off the missile strike."
- How much time do I have?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.600
Less than six minutes.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.520
Did you get a thermal read
on how many hostiles?

04:45.600 --> 04:48.600
We estimate 16. Jack...

04:48.680 --> 04:51.280
I'm not turning back, Erin.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.520
Understood.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.800
Good luck.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.240
... the injustices he has committed.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.800
Obedience is a master
who engages the world...

05:15.880 --> 05:18.320
" Stop this. Please.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.720
Just stop this, please.
You've got to stop this.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.040
My father hasn't done anything to hurt you.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.720
He's an innocent man. Please.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.040
- "Your ignorant followers obey..."
- He's innocent.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.400
- Please.
- "... while the true believers wait patiently."

05:38.480 --> 05:40.960
Please, listen to me.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.840
Please. No, no, wait. Please.
You've got to stop it. Listen!

05:46.800 --> 05:49.160
Audrey? Behind you.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.400
Oh, my God. Jack.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.600
- Are you all right? Did they hurt you?
- I'm OK. You've got to stop them.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.040
- I will.
- Get my father first.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.080
Go.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.280
Take this.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.920
Press the button on the handle.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.760
You use that if you have to.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.560
I'll be back for you. I promise.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.000
" Jack.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.040
Finally, we hold you responsible
for blasphemy.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.160
For desecrating holy lands and shrines.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.600
And for spilling the blood of our brothers.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.960
James Heller, your guilt on these charges
is not a matter of dispute.

07:01.040 --> 07:07.200
I have here a full confession
which you have signed.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.840
So now it is time for your sentence to be read

07:10.920 --> 07:14.640
and for the execution of that sentence
to be carried out.

07:15.160 --> 07:20.760
James Heller, before the eyes of God,
I sentence you to death.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.960
Carried out immediately.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.080
- Call off the missile.
- Abort. Please confirm.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.000
He's doing it.

08:03.280 --> 08:08.320
- There's one in the pipe. We gotta get Audrey.
- Down the hall.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.760
- It's been aborted.
- Where are the marines?

08:10.840 --> 08:13.480
They haven't crossed the perimeter.
I'll get an ETA.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.640
We're clear.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.440
She was here. We gotta go. Move, move!

09:07.920 --> 09:11.280
Take the two shooters at your 11 o'clock.
You ready?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.840
- Ready!
- Go!

09:19.560 --> 09:21.920
Gimme a clip.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.040
Jack!

09:33.120 --> 09:36.080
It went off my vest.
It's all right. Keep firing.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.440
I'm out!

09:57.240 --> 09:59.440
I'm out too.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.600
It's the marines. Stay down.

11:03.720 --> 11:08.640
Mr Secretary, stay down.
Just stay down until this area's secure.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.560
Jack!

11:10.640 --> 11:13.440
- Stand down!
- Step back or I'll kill her.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.880
- Put your gun down now.
- Step back! I'll kill her!

11:16.960 --> 11:19.920
I will kill her!

11:20.000 --> 11:22.400
Do it! Do it!

11:22.480 --> 11:25.920
OK. Just relax. Audrey, stay calm.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.280
Just relax.

11:30.360 --> 11:34.360
This is over. You are surrounded.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.920
You're right. But first you'll watch her die.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.600
Yes, sir.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.760
- The president sends his gratitude.
- I'm just glad you both are all right.

12:40.840 --> 12:44.600
It's a while since you been in the field.
You haven't skipped a beat.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.080
- Audrey and I owe you our lives.
- Thank you, sir.

12:48.160 --> 12:53.000
I've arranged transportation back to CTU.
I'd like you and Audrey to be debriefed there.

12:53.080 --> 12:58.000
As long as we don't lose time finding out who
these terrorists are and where they're from.

12:58.080 --> 13:02.920
I'll set up a live feed with the office
in Washington. You won't miss a step.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.760
- Those soldiers are waiting to take us to CTU.
- Thanks.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
How is she?

13:10.080 --> 13:14.040
A doctor needs to check out
these contusions and she's dehydrated.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.320
- Thank you. We should go.
- Where?

13:17.400 --> 13:20.560
I'm taking you and your father back to CTU.

13:20.640 --> 13:23.280
When I was inside,
I recognised one of the men.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.440
- Who?
- I don't know.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.760
I can't place him,
but I know that I saw him before today.

13:28.840 --> 13:33.200
They're gonna correlate a photo file
of the casualties. Then you can make your ID.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.600
Excuse me. Bauer.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.160
Agent Bauer, this is CTU.
I've got Paul Raines on the line.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.520
He'd like to speak with his wife.
Is she with you?

13:43.520 --> 13:45.760
Hold on one second.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.520
It's Paul. He wants to speak with you.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.160
" Paul.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.880
- Audrey. Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.560
- "Thank God."
- Where are you?

14:00.640 --> 14:04.640
As soon as I heard about you and your father
I got on a plane.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.520
- You're in LA?
- "Yeah, I'm at CTU."

14:09.040 --> 14:11.440
- Audrey?
- "Yeah?"

14:12.920 --> 14:15.760
See you soon.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.840
I'll see you soon.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.480
We need to go.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.560
You all right?

14:25.640 --> 14:27.560
Mm-hm.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.640
OK.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.760
- Make sure Edgar gets this.
- Got it.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.800
Find anything?

14:47.880 --> 14:52.440
I'm trying to connect to the feed from the site.
Division's using up our bandwidth.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.440
Tell them to multiplex.
We need to go through the debris.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.280
Now Heller's safe,
we're no longer in first position.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.120
Ms Driscoll?

15:00.200 --> 15:03.360
- I took care of it.
- What's that?

15:03.440 --> 15:07.080
A list of pass codes for the FBI fibre.
You can use their feed.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.440
- How did you get that?
- I used to consult there. Still have friends.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.960
I saw the load on the routing table
and knew we'd run into a traffic jam.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.760
Good. Install it.

15:18.760 --> 15:23.080
Start cataloguing whatever's there.
Anything that flags, promote it up to me.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.840
Yeah.

15:29.800 --> 15:35.080
You know, if you let me, Curtis,
I could help you a whole lot more.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.920
I don't even know
why you have a problem with me.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.360
Cos I'm ambitious?
OK, I'm ambitious. Aren't you?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.280
I don't sleep with people
to get ahead in my career.

15:44.360 --> 15:49.080
Neither do I. I slept with you
because I was attracted to you.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.360
I still am.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.800
Deal with it.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.120
The White House has confirmed
that the interrupted video transmission

16:05.200 --> 16:09.600
was caused by a raid mounted by the marines
and the Counter Terrorist Unit

16:09.680 --> 16:14.600
who rescued secretary of defense
James Heller moments ago.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.400
- Of course I'm watching.
- " Things look good."

16:17.480 --> 16:20.640
God willing our good fortune
will continue for the rest of the day.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.720
What are you talking about?

16:22.800 --> 16:26.040
It's over, they found Omar.
The government stopped the trial.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.880
- Yes, I know.
- Then how can you say this is good fortune?

16:29.960 --> 16:34.040
Everything is ruined. You made me
kill someone I cared about over nothing.

16:34.120 --> 16:38.720
No, not for nothing, Behrooz.
The trial was only our first step.

16:39.680 --> 16:44.760
- I don't understand.
- There were certain things we kept from you.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.040
- What things?
- Please. I'm busy.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.560
You forced me to kill my girlfriend.
You owe me an explanation.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.760
I don't owe you anything.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.960
See who it is. See who it is.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.319
It's Tariq.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.520
Why is he here?

17:18.319 --> 17:20.440
Tariq.

17:24.079 --> 17:28.280
- Behrooz, you remember Tariq?
- Of course he does.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.520
I just spoke with Marwan.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.720
- He assured me everything is on schedule.
- Why are you here?

17:36.800 --> 17:40.640
Your mother told Marwan
you took care of the American girl?

17:40.720 --> 17:44.000
- Yeah.
- Then you need help getting rid of the body.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.080
I don't need help. I can do it myself.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.120
I'm sure you can,
but we can't afford any more mistakes.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.800
Show Tariq where the body is.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.880
Go.

18:14.520 --> 18:19.160
" OK, Agent Manning, this is the last
of the bodies. You should see them now.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.200
All right. Got it. What's next?

18:22.880 --> 18:27.480
Here's some of the terrorist gear
we collected out of the warehouse.

18:31.760 --> 18:35.640
- Wait a second. Stop. Go back.
- You need me to retransmit?

18:35.720 --> 18:38.840
No. In front of you,
gimme a shot of that briefcase.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.520
- This?
- Yeah, can you open it?

18:46.000 --> 18:50.640
- It's empty.
- Are there any identifying marks on it?

18:51.560 --> 18:55.960
- Some kind of logo engraved near the lock.
- Let me see. Zoom in.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.560
- Make sure that's on the next transport.
- "Will do."

19:04.640 --> 19:06.720
Sarah, I need a corporate logo search.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.360
I may have a link between the crash
and the abduction. I'll send it now.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.000
We'll pick this up later.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.960
The man I recognised at the warehouse?
I want to make that ID.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.120
As soon as you've been checked out
I'll get the photos.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.120
- Excuse me, Ms Raines. This way, please.
- It's all right, go ahead.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.200
" I need you to handle this.
I need to trust you'll take care of it.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.880
OK. Good. Excuse us.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.920
I need your station. Have Driscoll
send me a pass code for the outside feed.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.160
- OK.
- Thanks.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.400
Does he know?

19:51.040 --> 19:54.080
About you and Jack.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.640
- How long have you known?
- Not until today.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.440
I'm surprised I hadn't figured it out till now.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.960
It's not what you think. Paul and I were over
before I started seeing Jack.

20:06.040 --> 20:11.440
Paul doesn't think it's over. Last time I spoke
with him, he thought he had a second chance.

20:11.520 --> 20:15.960
That's more about fixing his wounded pride
than fixing this relationship.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.520
So, he doesn't know about it?

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
Not yet.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.440
I'll take care of it.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.840
Ms Raines? Right through here.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.840
Yeah. No, not till I get back.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.400
You have a thread connecting the bombing
to the abduction?

20:55.480 --> 20:59.760
Yeah. About an hour ago.
NTSB reported that a passenger was killed.

20:59.840 --> 21:04.720
But not as the result of the crash.
He was shot at close range.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.920
- Who is he?
- Still trying to find out.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.120
He had no ID and his face and prints
don't show up on any database.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.160
But whoever killed him stole something
he had chained to his wrists.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.560
I think it may have been this.

21:18.480 --> 21:22.160
A witness on the train saw
a man with a briefcase handcuffed to him.

21:22.240 --> 21:26.640
Take a look at the damage.
Could've been sustained during the crash.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.440
We recovered this
where Heller was being held.

21:29.520 --> 21:35.880
What are you telling me, the train bombing
was a cover for the theft of this briefcase?

21:35.960 --> 21:38.840
- What was in it?
- It was empty.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.720
But we traced the corporate logo
on the briefcase

21:41.800 --> 21:45.520
- to McLennen-Forster.
- The defence contractor?

21:45.600 --> 21:47.760
- Yeah.
- Have you contacted them?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.560
Just got off the phone to their CEO.
He stonewalled.

21:50.640 --> 21:55.640
Said before he disclosed anything we'd need
clearance from the Department of Defense.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.360
The secretary should be able to get us
whatever clearances we need.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.680
- Let's get a printout of all this.
- Yeah.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.960
Our top story, only moments ago
a second broadcast

22:07.040 --> 22:10.440
showing secretary of defense James Heller
was put on the Internet.

22:10.520 --> 22:14.680
This image was captured from that broadcast.
The transmission then ceased.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.920
At this time we have
no confirmed report on why...

22:18.000 --> 22:20.360
The girl's mother went home.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.720
Even if she calls the police it will be too late.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.320
I heard the news in the car.
Everything was accomplished?

22:30.400 --> 22:35.040
Yes. The trial was cut short,
but it served its purpose.

22:35.880 --> 22:41.280
When they search the warehouse,
will they figure out what we're doing?

22:41.360 --> 22:45.440
Doesn't matter.
It's too late for them to stop it.

22:48.560 --> 22:53.360
If everything is working on schedule,
why do you look so troubled?

22:59.880 --> 23:02.440
Where's Behrooz?

23:03.480 --> 23:06.280
He went to bury the girl.

23:06.360 --> 23:09.520
- But his car is still in the driveway.
- He didn't take it.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.680
I don't understand.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.200
He went with Tariq.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.400
Tariq was here?

23:32.480 --> 23:36.160
" My God, he's going to kill my son.

23:40.960 --> 23:44.680
My God.
He's going to kill our son.

23:45.480 --> 23:46.720
Yes.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.800
I told Marwan
that Behrooz took care of the girl.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.600
Marwan must not have been satisfied.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.040
He must have decided
that Behrooz was a liability.

23:56.120 --> 23:59.440
How could you let this happen?
How could you let them kill our son?

23:59.520 --> 24:05.240
- What could I do? What could I do?
- He's our son! Our flesh and blood.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.120
- Dina, listen to me.
- How could you let them kill our son?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.640
Behrooz stopped being our son
a long time ago.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.320
- How can you say that?
- Because it's true.

24:14.400 --> 24:18.360
Living here has changed him.
He's been like a stranger to us.

24:18.440 --> 24:23.560
He proved it to me today,
that he no longer believes in our cause.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.680
Maybe he never did.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.440
Behrooz. Behrooz. Oh, my God.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.840
Secretary Heller would like
to say a few words to you.

25:09.680 --> 25:16.160
I'm incredibly privileged to have the finest
people in the world behind me - all of you.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.960
It's gonna take a lot more
than a few words to express my feelings,

25:21.040 --> 25:25.440
but for now,
from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.840
- Curtis Manning, head of tactical.
- Curtis.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.080
An honour, sir.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.680
Please, sit down.

25:39.760 --> 25:43.240
Erin, my daughter and I owe you our lives.

25:43.320 --> 25:47.840
Sounds like you had to make some
tough calls, but you made the right ones.

25:47.920 --> 25:53.800
I'll see to it that you get full recognition
for a job exceptionally well done.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.160
Thank you, sir.

26:00.640 --> 26:05.440
Now, before we start the debriefing,
I'd like to visit with my son. Where is he?

26:05.520 --> 26:09.680
- We're actually holding Richard here, sir.
- Why's that?

26:09.760 --> 26:12.440
When we brought Richard in,
we gave him a polygraph.

26:12.520 --> 26:16.440
It indicated that he was possibly
withholding information from us.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.200
About my kidnapping?

26:19.280 --> 26:25.000
We have wildly different political views,
but I can't believe that he was involved.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.720
We don't think he had knowing participation.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.160
We believe he shared knowledge
of your whereabouts with someone

26:31.240 --> 26:35.240
and he refuses to divulge that information
or their identity.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.440
And what are you doing about that?

26:37.520 --> 26:41.640
We discussed a number of options.
You have to understand the circumstances.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.760
Stop BS-ing me. What did you do to him?

26:43.840 --> 26:47.120
A technique that's noninvasive -
sensory disorientation.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.040
You subjected my son to SDT?

26:50.720 --> 26:53.480
Yes, but it was stopped
the moment you were rescued.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.240
- Jack, did you know about this?
- No, sir.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.200
- I want to see my son now.
- Of course. Curtis.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.720
Erin, I realise you've been
under pressure these past few hours,

27:04.800 --> 27:07.400
but you'd better have cause for this.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.320
Jack?

27:14.440 --> 27:19.040
I appreciate you not involving the secretary
in our differences on this operation.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.120
We both did what we thought was right.

27:21.200 --> 27:25.440
I'd like to put the past behind us, Jack.
I could use your help.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.520
What do you need?

27:27.600 --> 27:32.880
I'd like you to function in Ronnie's position
as head of field ops until we avert this crisis.

27:32.960 --> 27:37.480
- Whatever I can do to help.
- Let me make one thing clear.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.040
Ronnie was under my command
and you will be too.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.360
Understood.

27:44.440 --> 27:47.400
The photos from the warehouse,
are they ready for Audrey?

27:47.480 --> 27:51.560
I believe so. I'll have Edgar
port them to a work station.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.640
OK. Thank you.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.240
Dad.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.440
They said you were OK. Audrey too.
Thank God.

28:15.320 --> 28:21.120
I said some awful things before. I was afraid
I'd never get a chance to apologise.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.160
I said some pretty harsh things myself.

28:24.240 --> 28:29.200
But no matter what was said, you're still
my son and I will always love you.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.680
Me too, Dad.

28:38.360 --> 28:42.320
They said they were using
some interrogation techniques.

28:42.400 --> 28:46.360
They were totally out of line.
I'm gonna sue them blind.

28:46.440 --> 28:50.800
I think it'll be a little more effective
if you let me deal with it.

28:50.880 --> 28:55.880
I promise you,
if they were out of line, heads will roll.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.000
What do you mean, "if'?

28:59.280 --> 29:03.560
Why did they think you were
holding something back from them?

29:03.640 --> 29:06.520
I don't know.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.960
If you know something
that would shed some light...

29:10.040 --> 29:13.160
You don't think I'd tell them
if I thought it was relevant?

29:13.240 --> 29:17.600
- So there is something?
- Now you're giving me the third degree?

29:17.680 --> 29:22.000
Son, do you have any idea
what your sisterjust went through?

29:22.080 --> 29:27.560
If you know anything that would help us
find the people behind this, tell me now.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.640
Dad.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.080
I'm glad you're alive, I really am.

29:33.160 --> 29:38.320
But I am not going to tell these people things
about my private life they don't need to know.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.120
That you don't "think" they need to know.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.680
Richard, these people
were trying to save our lives.

29:45.760 --> 29:49.600
These people can't be trusted!
What they did to me is proof.

29:56.240 --> 29:59.720
Agent Manning,
could you come in here, please?

30:05.560 --> 30:11.840
Agent Manning, I am authorising you
to do whatever you feel is necessary

30:11.920 --> 30:16.080
- to get this information out of my son.
- Dad.

30:16.160 --> 30:20.880
I love you, son,
but I have a duty to my country.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.720
You can't be serious.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.240
Dad!

30:49.600 --> 30:52.480
Bring the shovels from the back.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.040
Come on. Help me.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.680
They said it was OK to come in.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.680
Hi, Paul.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.080
My God, I was so worried.

32:08.080 --> 32:12.400
- Are you hurt?
- Just cuts and scrapes. Nothing serious.

32:12.480 --> 32:16.360
- Sure?
- Yeah, really. I'm OK, Paul.

32:16.440 --> 32:18.640
They've OKed me for my debriefing.

32:30.720 --> 32:35.280
On the flight over,
I couldn't stop thinking about us.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.880
How, when we separated, we said

32:37.960 --> 32:44.720
that we'd both take time
to figure out what we wanted. Now I know.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.440
- Paul...
- I want us to be together again.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.720
I'm ready to work at it.

32:50.800 --> 32:54.360
I'll make our marriage the first priority.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.680
Just give us a chance.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.360
I'm sorry, Paul.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.840
That's not what I want.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.440
Audrey.

33:12.520 --> 33:17.040
I am a fool for bringing this up. You can't
make decisions when you're in this state.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.240
Paul.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.680
I'm seeing someone.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.880
Well, how long's this been going on?

33:36.960 --> 33:39.320
Six months.

33:40.320 --> 33:44.160
- Do you love him, or...
- Yes.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.800
Audrey?

33:48.240 --> 33:50.680
I'm sorry, excuse me.
I'll come back later.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.640
No, um...

33:52.720 --> 33:55.000
Paul, this is Jack Bauer.

33:57.120 --> 34:01.680
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the one that saved Audrey's life.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.000
Thank you.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.480
You're welcome.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.239
- Those photos are ready for you to look at.
- OK.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.239
- Paul, we'll talk later?
- Yeah.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.199
You all right?

34:39.560 --> 34:41.159
Yeah.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.440
You ready to go?

34:43.520 --> 34:45.520
Not yet.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.920
Now I am.

35:35.440 --> 35:38.360
No. No.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.640
You're certain you saw this guy before?

35:40.720 --> 35:43.720
Positive, and I could tell
that he recognised me.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.720
No. No.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.400
- That's all of them.
- He must've gotten out before the rescue.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.680
We should go through them again
to be sure.

35:54.760 --> 36:00.720
I will, but there are only two men here that
aren't Middle Eastern and neither were him.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.520
What?

36:06.600 --> 36:09.240
- I remember where I saw him before.
- Where?

36:09.320 --> 36:13.200
There was a Heritage Foundation dinner
about two months ago at the Hyatt.

36:13.280 --> 36:18.120
- Do you remember his name?
- No, but maybe I can get the guest list.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.560
Driscoll wants you in a conference call
that starts in a minute.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.600
OK. Get hold of the Hyatt hotel
security department.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.960
Access their archival surveillance.
Audrey'll give you a date.

36:28.040 --> 36:31.440
Set a parameter, keep Driscoll informed.
Be right back.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.520
It's hot.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.600
Argh!

37:26.200 --> 37:28.520
You brought me here to kill me. Why?

37:33.920 --> 37:38.200
Why are you doing this?
I did everything they told me to do.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.400
- You know why.
- I took care of the girl. Marwan knows.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.120
It's not Marwan who wants you dead.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.720
Then who wants me dead?

37:46.800 --> 37:48.800
Who?

37:52.880 --> 37:55.000
Who wants me dead?

37:55.800 --> 37:58.000
I want to know! Tell me!

37:59.000 --> 38:01.520
Your father.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.960
No! No!

38:06.040 --> 38:09.600
It's not true! No! No!

38:30.560 --> 38:32.680
Dad!

38:32.760 --> 38:35.000
Please!

38:35.080 --> 38:37.640
No!

38:44.640 --> 38:47.640
Mr Reiss, I'm Erin Driscoll,
director of CTU, Los Angeles.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.720
My colleagues Curtis Manning
and Sarah Gavin are present.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.320
Also Jack Bauer,
advisor to Secretary Heller.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.760
I hope you understand McLennen-Forster
couldn't give you details about that case

38:57.840 --> 39:00.120
until we received permission from DOD.

39:00.200 --> 39:04.360
Understood, Mr Reiss. May we begin?
What was your courier transporting?

39:04.440 --> 39:08.760
It's a device we developed under the NRC's
emergency management programme.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.240
It's a Dobson-type override.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.480
What exactly does this override do?

39:13.560 --> 39:18.000
It can remotely take control
of a nuclear power facility.

39:18.080 --> 39:21.080
Under what circumstances
would the override be used?

39:21.160 --> 39:23.920
The government wants
to control a plant's nuclear pile

39:24.000 --> 39:26.640
in case of a disaster
necessitating evacuation.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.880
A person with this program,
could they do the opposite?

39:29.960 --> 39:32.120
Create a disaster at a plant, a melt down?

39:32.200 --> 39:35.360
Theoretically, but possession
of the override isn't enough.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.840
- "There are safeguards."
- What safeguards?

39:37.920 --> 39:41.920
Anyone using the override
would have to hack into the reactor's firewall.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.840
That would take massive computer power,
which NRC could see coming a mile away.

39:46.920 --> 39:49.240
Is it possible NRC could miss this

39:49.320 --> 39:52.240
- due to heavy traffic on the Internet?
- "I don't follow."

39:52.320 --> 39:54.840
Less than an hour ago millions of computers

39:54.920 --> 39:58.000
were streaming the trial
of the secretary of defense.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.760
Is it possible that this trial
was just some kind of a Trojan Horse

40:01.840 --> 40:05.880
to disguise a massive attack
on a nuclear power plant's firewalls?

40:05.960 --> 40:08.080
It might be possible.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.480
How many nuclear plants
in this country would be vulnerable?

40:11.560 --> 40:14.560
- "All of them."
- How many is that?

40:15.080 --> 40:18.760
At this time the United States
has 104 nuclear power plants online.

40:18.840 --> 40:23.840
Assume they've used this override to take
over the plants. Get me NRC and find Heller.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.200
Thank you.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.760
- Set up a briefing.
- " Get me NRC. Pipe it through here.

40:28.840 --> 40:32.160
" I want all personnel
in the conference area.

40:32.240 --> 40:36.400
Edgar, can you monitor
my allocation tables for a few minutes?

40:36.480 --> 40:38.360
Sure.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.480
- " Yes?"
- It's me.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.560
- "You're on a secure line?"
- Yes.

41:03.640 --> 41:06.280
I'd have checked in sooner.
This was my first chance.

41:06.360 --> 41:08.640
All right. Go on.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.760
They found out about the override.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.560
