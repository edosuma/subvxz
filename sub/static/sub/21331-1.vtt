That the war
was too much for him.

01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:06.928
Then the man who cared for him
stopped speaking too.

01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:11.683

before he stopped speaking...

01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:15.770
that the virus
that almost wiped us out...

survivor still carries...

01:20:19.649 --> 01:20:21.818

01:20:27.324 --> 01:20:30.368
it would destroy humanity

Some of the men
questioned my judgment.

01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:12.679
I was asking them to do
what I had done.

01:22:12.846 --> 01:22:15.140

Of course, they refused.

01:22:25.483 --> 01:22:27.152

One of those cowards fled
to my superiors up North.

01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:40.999

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:43.960
this plague could be
dealt with medically.

01:22:44.586 --> 01:22:48.423

01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:54.471

so that he could return,
and deliver a message.

If they wanted to
relieve me of my command...

01:23:10.779 --> 01:23:13.615

meet me here...

01:23:13.782 --> 01:23:15.742
