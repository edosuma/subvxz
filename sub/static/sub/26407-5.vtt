WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:07.485
GIRL: THIS IS SO STUPID.
WHAT ARE WE, 12?

00:07.529 --> 00:09.574
SECOND GIRL: OK, WE'RE
JUST HAVING FUN.
IT'S ALL THIS IS.

00:09.618 --> 00:13.100
HUNTING FOR A GHOST
IN THE WOODS IS NOT
MY IDEA OF FUN.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.623
IT'S NOT FUN,
IT'S REAL.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.929
AND WE'RE GONNA
SEE HIM IF IT
TAKES ALL NIGHT.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.583
ALL NIGHT?

00:18.627 --> 00:21.282
ALL NIGHT? ARE YOU--
WE LEFT A PERFECTLY
GOOD PARTY FOR THIS.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.414
AND I'M NOT FREEZING
MY ASS OFF OUT HERE
ALL NIGHT.

00:25.851 --> 00:28.419
WELL, FINE, I'LL STAY
OUT HERE BY MYSELF.

00:28.463 --> 00:31.205
TALL MAN, TALL MAN,

00:31.248 --> 00:33.555
LONG-HAIRED TALL MAN.

00:33.598 --> 00:37.515
NEVER GONNA CATCH ME.
NEVER GONNA CATCH ME.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.430
NEVER GONNA CATCH ME.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.432
OK. ARE WE GONNA
DO THIS OR NOT?

00:41.476 --> 00:44.174
YEAH.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.306
HEY, ALLY.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.742
WHAT?

00:46.785 --> 00:49.179
WAIT UP.

01:13.551 --> 01:16.337
IS THE FIRE OUT?

01:16.380 --> 01:17.816
IT'S OUT.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.905
DID YOU CHECK?

01:27.478 --> 01:29.698
YOU WERE RIGHT.
I'M ON FIRE.

01:29.741 --> 01:30.699
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.614
PUT ME OUT, BRENT.
PUT ME OUT.

01:32.657 --> 01:33.571
AHH.

01:37.445 --> 01:41.449
HE HAS THEM.
HE HAS THEM.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.886
HE HAS MY FRIENDS.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.148
WOMAN: WHO

01:45.192 --> 01:48.673
THE TALL MAN.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.635
BREAKFAST IS SERVED.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.245
THANK YOU, BABE.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.464
SAY "THANK YOU,"
BOYS.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.943
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.075
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.990
ANY SPECIAL REQUESTS
WHILE I'M UP?

02:01.033 --> 02:03.123
MAY I HAVE SOME KETCHUP
WITH MY EGGS?

02:03.166 --> 02:05.560
CAN I HAVE LIME JUICE?

02:05.603 --> 02:08.563
LIME JUICE?

02:08.606 --> 02:10.478
WHAT

02:11.783 --> 02:12.828
I'LL GO GET SOME.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.483
WILL: LIME JUICE
IS GOOD, RIGHT?

02:15.526 --> 02:18.486
HOW'S THE BACON?

02:18.529 --> 02:22.316
OOP. OOP.
WE GOT A SPILL.

02:22.359 --> 02:25.754
UH-OH. HENRY.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.279
OUR NEXT CASE,

02:29.323 --> 02:31.847
WHERE WE'RE HEADED TO.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.197
EAST ALLEGHENY.
YOUR HOMETOWN, HUH?

02:34.241 --> 02:37.069
I SWORE I WOULD
GET OUT OF THERE

02:37.113 --> 02:39.376
AND NEVER GO BACK.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.204
I HAVE TO GO.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.727
RIGHT?

02:42.771 --> 02:45.121
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO ANYTHING, DARLING.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.689
BUT THIS CASE, TWO GIRLS
MISSING IN THE WOODS,

02:47.732 --> 02:49.691
IT'S GONNA BOTHER YOU
IF YOU DON'T GO.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.606
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHERE?

02:51.649 --> 02:53.129
WHERE?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.523
IN A PARK,
DEAD MAN'S CONSERVATORY.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.699
IS THAT IMPORTANT?

02:57.742 --> 02:59.614
YEAH.

02:59.657 --> 03:02.182
I THINK I KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.662
JJ: LAST NIGHT
3 TEENAGE GIRLS

03:04.706 --> 03:06.577
WENT SEARCHING FOR
THE TALL MAN.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.014
IT'S A REGIONAL GHOST STORY.

03:09.058 --> 03:12.017
ACCORDING TO THE SURVIVOR
RECOVERED THIS MORNING,

03:12.061 --> 03:14.977
THEY FOUND HIM.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.240
ALVEZ: SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE WENT THROUGH HELL.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.328
SHE SAY WHAT HAPPENED?

03:18.372 --> 03:19.590
THAT WOULD BE
ALLY MACREADY.

03:19.634 --> 03:20.852
AND ACCORDING TO HER,

03:20.896 --> 03:23.942
THE TALL MAN HELD THEM
AND CUT THEM REPEATEDLY.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.293
THAT IS CONSISTENT
WITH THE LEGEND.

03:26.336 --> 03:30.122
SO THE TALL MAN IS YOUR CLASSIC
DON'T-GO-INTO-THE-WOODS DARE.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.994
SURVIVE THE NIGHT,
YOU SURVIVE HIM.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.735
HE CATCHES YOU,
HE CUTS YOU

03:33.778 --> 03:35.606
UNTIL YOU REVEAL
YOUR DEEPEST SECRETS.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.478
LET'S GO BACK TO
THE VICTIMS FOR A SECOND.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.306
DID THEY SNEAK OUT
OR DID THEIR PARENTS KNOW?

03:39.349 --> 03:41.003
THEY TOLD THEIR PARENTS
THAT THEY WERE GOING
TO A PARTY,

03:41.046 --> 03:42.526
AND THEY ACTUALLY DID.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.701
OK, SO THEN OFF
THE BAT WE HAVE

03:43.745 --> 03:45.312
TWO THEORIES
ABOUT THE UNSUB.

03:45.355 --> 03:46.835
ONE IS THAT HE KNEW
THEY WERE PLANNING THIS.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.793
WHICH PUTS HIM IN
THE GIRLS' INNER CIRCLE.

03:48.837 --> 03:52.101
EXACTLY. OR TWO,
HE WAITED IN THE WOODS
OPPORTUNISTICALLY.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.712
BUT THAT STRATEGY
ONLY WORKS IF HE PLAYS
THE ODDS RIGHT.

03:54.756 --> 03:57.106
SO HOW FAR REACHING
IS THIS GHOST STORY?

03:57.149 --> 03:58.281
MAYBE I CAN
ANSWER THAT.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.761
THE STORY JJ
GREW UP WITH,

03:59.804 --> 04:03.634
IT'S GONNA VIRAL,
AND THE PHOTOSHOP
WORK IS ON FLEEK.

04:03.678 --> 04:07.508
TALL MAN IS A STORY.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE
GIRLS IS REAL.

04:07.551 --> 04:10.467
THE FIRST 24 HOURS ARE CRUCIAL
IN AN ABDUCTION CASE,

04:10.511 --> 04:13.165
AND WE ARE NOT DOWN TO 18.
LET'S MOVE.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.263
GIRL: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:23.306 --> 04:24.568
NOTHING.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.048
DON'T SAY "NOTHING."
MY NECKLACE IS MISSING.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.441
YOU STOLE IT AGAIN,
DIDN'T YOU?

04:27.484 --> 04:29.094
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO SAY STAY OUT OF MY ROOM?

04:40.018 --> 04:41.890
WHY DO YOU EVEN LIKE
THIS SO MUCH?

04:45.894 --> 04:48.679
BECAUSE IT'S YOURS.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.469
THEN I WANT YOU
TO HAVE IT.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.514
REALLY?

04:57.558 --> 04:58.646
YEAH.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.735
ARE YOU SURE?

05:00.778 --> 05:02.693
I'M SURE.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.351
BECAUSE NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

05:08.395 --> 05:10.048
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, JJ.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.617
PRENTISS: JJ?

05:15.750 --> 05:16.925
WHEELS UP.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.275
WHEELS UP.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.893
GOOD MORNING, ALLY.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.330
MY NAME IS BRENDA,
AND I'M YOUR NURSE

05:30.373 --> 05:31.853
FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.637
THE POLICE HAVE ASKED
THAT I SCRAPE

05:33.681 --> 05:35.552
UNDER YOUR FINGERNAILS
FOR EVIDENCE.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.467
THIS WON'T HURT AT ALL.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.816
YOU'LL BARELY EVEN NOTICE

05:38.860 --> 05:40.514
THAT I'M DOING ANYTHING.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.819
ARE YOU OK WITH THAT?

05:47.521 --> 05:48.826
GIRL: HE'S COMING.
ALLY HIDE.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.611
SECOND GIRL:
SOMEONE IS COMING!

05:50.654 --> 05:52.700
NO.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.148
NO! NO, NO, NO.

06:16.419 --> 06:17.768
AAH!

06:18.900 --> 06:21.032
AAH!

06:21.076 --> 06:22.207
AAH!

06:22.251 --> 06:23.426
GET AWAY FROM ME!

06:23.470 --> 06:25.515
GET AWAY FROM ME!

06:52.324 --> 06:55.676
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.248
JJ: "THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION ANYONE CAN ASK IS

07:03.292 --> 07:05.120
WHAT MYTH AM I LIVING?"

07:05.163 --> 07:08.732
CARL JUNG.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.779
I'D LIKE TO DIRECT
YOUR ATTENTION TO TWO ODDITIES.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.608
ODDITY NUMBER ONE IS
ALLY MACREADY'S MEDICAL EXAM.

07:14.651 --> 07:15.609
GIVE US THE HEADLINE.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.045
DESPITE OUTWARD
APPEARANCES,

07:17.088 --> 07:19.656
ALLY HAD A SUM TOTAL
OF ZERO WOUNDS ON HER.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.832
SO WHOSE BLOOD IS
ON YOUR CLOTHES, YOU ASK?

07:21.876 --> 07:23.747
DNA REPORT IS NOT
BACK YET,

07:23.791 --> 07:26.010
BUT TYPING AND MATCHING
POINTS TO THE OTHER GIRLS.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.099
SHE COULD HAVE
ESCAPED BEFORE THE
UNSUB GOT TO HER.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.101
HOLDING 3 GIRLS
TAKES A LOT OF
CONTROL.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.233
WHAT'S ODDITY
NUMBER TWO?

07:31.276 --> 07:32.800
THAT WOULD BE
A TEXT EXCHANGE

07:32.843 --> 07:35.367
BETWEEN BETHANY
AND CHELSEA.

07:35.411 --> 07:38.327
BETHANY SAYS TO CHELSEA,
"WHAT IF WE DO IT IN
THE WOODS TONIGHT?"

07:38.370 --> 07:42.113
TO WHICH CHELSEA RESPONDS,
"WE'D HAVE TO DO IT FAST.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.072
ALLY CAN'T SEE US COMING."

07:44.115 --> 07:46.161
VAGUELY THREATENING.
ALTHOUGH ALLY DIDN'T SAY

07:46.204 --> 07:47.641
ANYTHING LIKE THAT
IN HER INTERVIEW.

07:47.684 --> 07:50.513
TWO OF THE GIRLS HAD
SOME AGENDA BESIDES
THE TALL MAN.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.124
WE NEED TO SEE IF IT
PLAYED A PART IN
THEIR DISAPPEARANCE.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.691
CHELSEA'S DAD, TOM,

07:54.735 --> 07:56.258
HE DATED MY SISTER
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

07:56.301 --> 07:57.302
SO I CAN TALK
TO HIM.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.608
PRENTISS: GOOD. DO THAT.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.392
WE WILL DIVIDE AND CONQUER
WHEN WE LAND.

08:00.436 --> 08:04.396
WE WILL INVESTIGATE THIS
AS IF BETHANY AND CHELSEA
ARE STILL ALIVE,

08:04.440 --> 08:06.921
AND WE WILL NOT SLEEP
UNTIL WE FIND THEM.

08:19.629 --> 08:22.240
ARE YOU WITH HIM?

08:22.284 --> 08:23.894
THE TALL MAN?

08:23.938 --> 08:28.159
NO, ALLY, WE TOLD YOU.
WE'RE WITH THE FBI.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.858
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND
BETHANY AND CHELSEA.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.208
AND YOU CAN HELP US
BY LETTING US KNOW

08:33.251 --> 08:35.776
WHAT YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

08:35.819 --> 08:39.519
START IN THE WOODS.
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?

08:39.562 --> 08:41.085
ALLY: TALL MAN, TALL MAN.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.348
CHANTING.

08:43.392 --> 08:47.178
TALL MAN, TALL MAN,
LONG-HAIRED TALL MAN.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.223
NEVER GONNA CATCH ME.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.137
CHELSEA: HEY, ALLY.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.225
WHAT?

08:50.268 --> 08:52.270
WAIT UP.

08:52.314 --> 08:55.317
WE, UH, WE NEED
TO TALK.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.101
ABOUT WHAT?

08:57.145 --> 09:00.017
ABOUT YOU.

09:01.323 --> 09:04.935
I DON'T...I DON'T
FEEL SO GOOD.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.634
WHAT--WHAT'S
HAPPENING?

09:22.953 --> 09:26.304
ALLY: AND THEN HE
PUT US TO SLEEP,

09:26.348 --> 09:28.306
BECAUSE HE CAN DO THAT.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.700
AND WHEN WE WOKE UP,

09:30.744 --> 09:32.746
WE WERE IN HIS DOMAIN.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.836
NO! NO! NO!

09:38.403 --> 09:40.667
WHERE IS IT? TELL ME.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.321
ALLY, RUN!

09:43.365 --> 09:44.801
AAH!

09:46.194 --> 09:48.196
WHAT DID HE MEAN,
"WHERE IS IT?"

09:48.239 --> 09:50.415
WHERE'S CHELSEA'S
DEEPEST, DARKEST SECRET.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.026
THAT'S WHAT HE
ALWAYS WANTS,

09:52.069 --> 09:53.375
OUR SECRETS.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.769
DID HE ASK YOU
FOR YOUR SECRETS?

09:55.812 --> 09:58.598
NO.

09:58.641 --> 10:02.297
HE JUST--HE PUT ME
BACK TO SLEEP.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.734
AND WHEN I WOKE UP,
I WAS IN THE WOODS.

10:04.778 --> 10:08.390
ARE YOU SURE YOU TWO
AREN'T HIS MINIONS?

10:08.433 --> 10:11.045
WE PROMISE.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.655
BUT HOW COME YOU
THINK WE ARE?

10:14.657 --> 10:16.485
BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE HIM.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.402
YOU DON'T HAVE FACES.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.150
ALLY HAS SCHIZOPHRENIA?

10:29.193 --> 10:30.281
EARLY ONSET.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.500
AND WE CONFIRMED IT
WITH HER PARENTS.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.807
IT'S RARE IN TEENS,
BUT IT CAN HAPPEN.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.244
THE TELLTALE SYMPTOM
WAS HER FACE BLINDNESS.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.507
SCHIZOPHRENICS HAVE EXTREME
VISUAL PROCESSING PROBLEMS,

10:38.550 --> 10:40.378
MOST OBVIOUSLY IN
MEETING NEW PEOPLE

10:40.422 --> 10:41.945
OR EXPERIENCING
NEW ENVIRONMENTS.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.947
ALVEZ: HER PARENTS
WERE TRYING TO KEEP HER
OFF MEDICATION.

10:43.991 --> 10:46.036
THAT'S WHY THE COPS
AND GARCIA DIDN'T FLAG IT.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.342
BESIDES THE PARENTS,
WHO ELSE KNEW?

10:47.385 --> 10:49.300
JUST BETHANY
AND CHELSEA. WHY?

10:49.344 --> 10:50.475
LOT OF HOLES
IN HER STORY.

10:50.519 --> 10:51.999
WELL, WE NOTICED
THAT, TOO.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.392
SHE WASN'T BOUND,
BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.611
SHE COULD HAVE
ESCAPED,

10:55.655 --> 10:58.048
INSTEAD SHE MAGICALLY
WOKE UP IN THE FOREST.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.441
COVERED IN HER
FRIENDS' BLOOD.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.269
MOST SCHIZOPHRENICS
ARE NOT VIOLENT,

11:01.312 --> 11:03.401
BUT THEY CAN BE PUSHED
TO VIOLENCE IF THEY'RE
THREATENED.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.621
MAYBE SHE DID THIS,
BUT IN HER MIND,

11:05.665 --> 11:06.970
IT WAS THE TALL MAN.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.580
AND THAT BRINGS US
BACK TO BETHANY

11:08.624 --> 11:10.844
AND CHELSEA'S TEXTS
ABOUT ALLY,

11:10.887 --> 11:13.542
AND IF THEIR AGENDA
WAS UPSETTING ENOUGH
TO INDUCE A BREAK.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.196
JJ'S WITH CHELSEA'S
DAD NOW.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.764
MAYBE SHE CAN FIND OUT
WHAT THEY NEEDED
TO TALK ABOUT.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.027
MY DAUGHTER AND HER
BEST FRIEND ARE MISSING

11:20.070 --> 11:22.029
AND YOU'RE ASKING
ABOUT THEIR TEXTS?

11:22.072 --> 11:24.292
GOD, JJ, IS THAT REALLY
WHAT'S IMPORTANT?

11:27.469 --> 11:28.775
I'M SORRY.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.646
IT'S OK.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.344
IT'S THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.303
AND THEN
ROSLYN JAREAU'S

11:35.346 --> 11:38.654
LITTLE SISTER SHOWS UP
TO ASK ME ABOUT IT.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.963
I USUALLY DON'T SEE
PEOPLE ON THEIR BEST DAY.

11:43.006 --> 11:46.575
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
TO LOOK INTO EVERY LEAD.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.925
OK?

11:48.969 --> 11:51.493
SO THESE TEXTS BETWEEN
BETHANY AND CHELSEA

11:51.536 --> 11:53.103
DIDN'T SOUND TOO FRIENDLY.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.323
ALLY'S GETTING WORSE--

11:55.366 --> 11:57.891
SINGING, TALKING
TO HERSELF.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.762
SO LAST NIGHT THEY
WERE GOING TO TRY

11:59.806 --> 12:01.895
TO TALK ALLY INTO
GETTING SOME HELP.

12:01.938 --> 12:06.160
WHY IN THE WOODS?
I MEAN, THERE ARE AT LEAST
A HUNDRED BETTER PLACES

12:06.203 --> 12:07.378
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.511
I DON'T KNOW.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.382
I REALLY DON'T.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.388
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:20.478 --> 12:21.958
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:23.220 --> 12:26.006
I MEAN, I REMEMBER
YOUR SISTER'S FUNERAL

12:26.049 --> 12:27.921
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.316
I COULD BARELY
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

12:33.317 --> 12:37.582
BUT YOU--YOU LIVE
IN THIS WORLD NOW.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.806
I DO.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.462
I GUESS I DO LIVE IN
THIS WORLD NOW.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.464
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:49.507 --> 12:51.640
I ALSO GET TO MAKE
A DIFFERENCE IN IT.

12:53.990 --> 12:57.559
THEN TELL ME I WON'T
HAVE TO BURY MY DAUGHTER.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.566
BETHANY: CHELSEA.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.437
YEAH?

13:06.481 --> 13:08.831
HOW BAD ARE YOU?

13:08.875 --> 13:11.007
BAD.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.487
HE'S REAL.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.575
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S REAL,

13:13.618 --> 13:14.750
AND THIS IS
HAPPENING TO US.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.360
STOP IT. STOP.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.971
THE TALL MAN IS NOT REAL.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.537
THIS IS JUST SOME FREAK
WHO GETS HIS KICKS

13:19.581 --> 13:20.843
OUT OF FLICKING US
WITH A RAZOR.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.149
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

13:22.192 --> 13:23.454
I DON'T KNOW.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.456
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S COMING.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.632
HE'S COMING BACK.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.995
NO.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.390
WHERE IS IT?

13:46.434 --> 13:49.219
STOP.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.091
I DON'T KNOW.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.708
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

13:59.751 --> 14:00.840
GARCIA: THE POLICE RECOVERED
ALL 3 GIRLS' PHONES

14:00.883 --> 14:02.102
IN THE WOODS.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.930
AND YOU KNOW HOW TEENS
AND MYSELF

14:03.973 --> 14:05.627
SPEND WAY TOO MUCH TIME
ON OUR SCREENS?

14:05.670 --> 14:07.194
WELL, THE BREAKDOWN
ON THE LAB REPORT

14:07.237 --> 14:09.849
FROM THE GIRLS' CELL PHONES
SUGGESTS A SUREFIRE WAY

14:09.892 --> 14:11.067
TO GET US ALL TO STOP.

14:11.111 --> 14:14.941
PLEASE LOOK AT THAT
REPORT ON YOUR TABLETS.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.293
FENTANYL AS IN
THE OPIOID DERIVATIVE?

14:19.336 --> 14:21.991
YEAH, TRACE ELEMENTS
WERE FOUND ON ALL 3 SCREENS.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.776
NOW, THE MEDICAL PATCH
IT COMES IN KNOCKS YOU OUT
INSTANTANEOUSLY.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.604
WAIT, HOLD UP.
FULL STOP.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.302
LET'S RETRACE
THE GIRLS' TIMELINE.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.651
THEY WENT TO A PARTY,

14:29.694 --> 14:32.088
THEN SOMEHOW
THE UNSUB MANAGES

14:32.132 --> 14:36.440
TO GET HIS HANDS
ON ALL 3 OF THE GIRLS'
PHONES TO LACE THEM?

14:36.484 --> 14:37.920
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
AT THE PARTY.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.617
BUT THEN HE'D HAVE
TO TIME THAT OUT

14:39.661 --> 14:40.749
WITH WHEN THEY WENT
INTO THE WOODS.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.359
NO ONE'S THAT GOOD.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.535
FACTOR THIS IN NOW.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.450
YOU'RE A TEENAGE GIRL.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.800
YOU KEEP YOUR CELL PHONE
ON YOU AT ALL TIMES.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.760
WHO WOULD YOU MAYBE
HAND IT OVER TO?

14:51.803 --> 14:52.892
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

14:52.935 --> 14:53.980
UH-HUH.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.895
I'M STARTING TO THINK
BETHANY OR CHELSEA

14:55.938 --> 14:57.374
MIGHT BE PULLING
THE STRINGS HERE.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.810
WHOA, SLOW DOWN.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.030
ALL 3 GIRLS' PHONES
WERE DRUGGED,

15:01.074 --> 15:02.727
AND ALLY HAD THE OTHER
GIRLS' BLOOD ON HER.

15:02.771 --> 15:05.513
I'M WITH ROSSI.
IF ONE OF THE GIRLS
WAS STAGING THIS,

15:05.556 --> 15:06.688
SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE
KNOCKED HERSELF OUT

15:06.731 --> 15:08.603
AND LET HERSELF GET CUT.

15:08.646 --> 15:09.996
THAT'S ONE HELL OF
A GASLIGHT.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.563
BUT NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE ONE,
ESPECIALLY WITH A PARTNER.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.742
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,
I THINK WE'RE MISSING
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.222
CHELSEA AND BETHANY
ARE BEST FRIENDS.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.746
WHY WOULD ONE RECRUIT
A PARTNER TO TERRORIZE
THE OTHER?

15:21.790 --> 15:25.707
OK, IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.753
"WHERE IS IT?"
THAT'S WHAT ALLY HEARD.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.973
SO THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING THEY LOST,

15:31.017 --> 15:33.758
SOMETHING THEY THINK
THE OTHER GIRL CAN FIND.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.847
I THINK WE NEED TO
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOL,

15:35.891 --> 15:37.066
SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.155
I KNOW A GUY OVER THERE
THAT COULD HELP US.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.462
GREAT.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.990
MAN: JENNIFER JAREAU.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.905
IS THAT YOU?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.907
WELL, HOW ARE YOU,
MR. HOWARD?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.126
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.997
LISTEN, YOU GRADUATED,
YOU CAN CALL ME ETHAN.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.086
I HEARD YOU GOT
PROMOTED.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.654
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
NOT THE GUIDANCE
COUNSELOR ANYMORE.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.134
OH, I'M STILL
THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.962
YEAH, I'M ALSO THE A.P.
ENGLISH TEACHER,

16:03.005 --> 16:05.965
AND SOME KINDS ACTUALLY
THINK I'M PRINCIPAL.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.227
SO DID YOU GET
MY MESSAGE?

16:07.270 --> 16:09.011
I DID. AND I PULLED
ALL THE KIDS

16:09.055 --> 16:10.752
THAT BETHANY AND CHELSEA
WERE LINKED IN WITH.

16:10.795 --> 16:11.753
GREAT.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.711
THIS WAY.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.152
THERE'S NOT MUCH
I CAN TELL YOU.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.981
BETHANY AND CHELSEA,
THEY LOVED EACH OTHER.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.070
THEY WERE MORE LIKE
SISTERS THAN FRIENDS.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.985
WELL, SISTERS FIGHT.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.638
DID THEY GET ON
EACH OTHER'S NERVES?

16:27.682 --> 16:30.641
THEY EVER HAVE ANY
KIND OF DISAGREEMENT?

16:30.685 --> 16:33.383
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE
TOTALLY A RUMOR,

16:33.427 --> 16:36.169
BUT BETHANY HAD THIS
SECRET BOYFRIEND.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.258
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE
WHO HE WAS.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.869
AND CHELSEA MADE FUN
OF HER FOR IT,

16:40.912 --> 16:42.740
ABOUT BETHANY
KEEPING IT A SECRET.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.265
AND BETHANY WAS LIKE,
"WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?"

16:45.308 --> 16:46.875
ROSLYN: YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT WE'RE IN LOVE.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.094
HE LOVES ME.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.834
MAN: ROSLYN, YOU AND TOM
ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.010
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT LOVE IS.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.272
YOU DON'T GET IT.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.275
GIRL: DO YOU KNOW
THAT FEELING?

16:55.318 --> 16:57.059
YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW
THAT FEELING.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.887
COULD YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THIS BOYFRIEND?

16:58.930 --> 17:00.802
WE MIGHT NEED TO
TALK TO HIM.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.283
ALL I CAN TELL YOU,
HE GAVE BETHANY A GIFT.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.241
JEWELRY, I THINK.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.330
CHELSEA GOT HER HANDS
ON IT SOMEHOW,

17:07.374 --> 17:10.638
AND SHE MADE IT HER
MISSION TO FIND OUT WHO
BETHANY GOT IT FROM.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.161
AND DID SHE?

17:12.205 --> 17:14.990
SHE TRIED.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.948
SHE NEVER GOT THERE.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.433
OK, SO LET'S ROLL
WITH THIS FOR A SECOND.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.479
BETHANY HAS
A SECRET BOYFRIEND.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.089
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE EXPOSED,

17:27.133 --> 17:28.395
NEITHER DOES SHE.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.397
BUT THEN CHELSEA GETS
HER HANDS ON SOMETHING

17:30.440 --> 17:32.007
NEITHER ONE WANTS
HER TO HAVE.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.704
RIGHT.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.054
SO THE JEWELRY

17:35.097 --> 17:37.230
HAS TO BE THE KEY
TO ALL OF IT.

17:37.273 --> 17:40.537
WHAT MOTIVATES THEM
TO THIS EXTREME?

17:43.975 --> 17:45.325
PRENTISS: JJ?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.024
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

17:53.028 --> 17:55.248
LOOK, EVER SINCE
WE TOOK THIS CASE,

17:55.291 --> 17:57.032
ALL OF THESE...

17:57.076 --> 18:01.254
MEMORIES
ARE COMING BACK,

18:01.297 --> 18:03.647
AND THEY ARE NOT
GOOD MEMORIES.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.475
YOU KNOW?

18:05.519 --> 18:08.174
ABOUT ROSLYN?

18:08.217 --> 18:10.915
YEAH.

18:10.959 --> 18:15.006
LIKE THAT MORNING SHE
TOOK MY FATHER'S RAZOR.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.666
I FOUND HER.

18:25.843 --> 18:30.021
AND I JUST STOOD THERE...

18:30.065 --> 18:32.328
FROZEN...

18:34.678 --> 18:36.637
FOR PROBABLY 10 MINUTES.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.687
IT'S LIKE BRAIN
COULDN'T, UM, COMPREHEND

18:43.731 --> 18:45.907
WHAT I WAS SEEING.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.127
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES I THINK--

18:48.170 --> 18:50.520
I THINK THAT'S WHY
I TOOK THIS JOB,

18:50.564 --> 18:52.609
SO I'D ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT TO DO,

18:52.653 --> 18:55.351
SO I WOULD NEVER
FREEZE AGAIN.

18:59.312 --> 19:03.098
SO CAN YOU--CAN YOU GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO DO, EMILY?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.492
BECAUSE I AM STARTING
TO FREEZE UP AGAIN.

19:06.754 --> 19:10.192
OK. UM, ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

19:10.236 --> 19:12.368
LUKE AND TARA ARE
GOING BACK ALLY.

19:12.412 --> 19:15.632
THEY ARE GOING TO USE
THE EMDR TECHNIQUE ON HER.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.026
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE

19:18.069 --> 19:19.810
WITH SCHIZOPHRENICS.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.032
LEWIS: THIS PROCESS
IS CALLED EYE MOVEMENT

19:24.075 --> 19:26.469
DESENSITIZATION
AND RECONDITIONING.

19:26.513 --> 19:30.169
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FOCUS ON THE MOVEMENT
OF THE METRONOME

19:30.212 --> 19:32.040
AND THE SOUND OF
OUR VOICES.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.262
ALVEZ: OK, LET'S GO BACK
TO THE LAST THING YOU REMEMBER

19:36.305 --> 19:37.959
IN HIS LAIR.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.656
I DON'T WANT TO.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.832
NOTHING BAD IS GOING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU, ALLY.

19:41.876 --> 19:44.835
YOU'RE SAFE. OK?

19:48.056 --> 19:50.232
AAH!

19:50.276 --> 19:54.976
WHERE IS IT?

19:55.019 --> 19:56.891
ALLY: HE'S HERE.

19:56.934 --> 20:00.764
HE'S HERE. HE'S HERE.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.985
LEWIS: ALLY, OPEN YOUR EYES
AND FOCUS ON THE METRONOME.

20:09.338 --> 20:12.254
LEWIS: NOW HELP US
FIND YOUR FRIENDS.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.431
DESCRIBE THE ROOM.

20:15.475 --> 20:18.565
ALLY: THERE'S THE DOOR
THAT HE CAME THROUGH.

20:18.608 --> 20:22.133
IT'S LIKE I'M IN
A TUNNEL OR SOMETHING.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.575
THERE'S WINDOWS
ALONG THE WALLS,

20:28.618 --> 20:32.143
BUT THEY'RE COVERED
IN THIS WEIRD CLOTH.

20:32.187 --> 20:35.364
ALLY, WHAT'S ON
THE CEILING?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.937
STARS.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.244
BUT THEY'RE PINK.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.594
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

20:47.637 --> 20:50.249
IT'S A TRAIN CAR.
IT'S ABANDONED.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.729
WE USED TO HAVE PARTIES
THERE BACK WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.688
SOMEBODY PUT PINK STARS
UP ON THE CEILING.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.473
OK, SO IT'S RIGHT HERE
IF IT HASN'T MOVED.

20:57.517 --> 20:58.648
PRENTISS: OK,
YOU'LL LEAD SWAT.

20:58.692 --> 20:59.780
TELL THEM TO WATCH
THEIR FRONT SIGHT.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.129
THERE ARE TEENAGERS
IN THERE.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.047
BETHANY?

21:06.090 --> 21:08.179
BETHANY: HMM

21:10.094 --> 21:13.097
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE
GONNA MAKE IT
OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.361
IF HE KILLS ME,
I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.626
I LIED.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.976
I DO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS.

21:22.019 --> 21:24.718
WHAT IS IT?

21:24.761 --> 21:27.155
PROMISE YOU WON'T GET
MAD AT ME, OK?

21:27.198 --> 21:28.461
I PROMISE.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.289
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,

21:30.332 --> 21:33.640
AND WE'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER, OK?

21:33.683 --> 21:35.946
JUST TELL ME.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.650
THAT'S WHY I HID IT,
BECAUSE I JUST WANTED

21:43.693 --> 21:45.173
TO KNOW WHO HE WAS.

21:45.216 --> 21:48.045
BUT HE KEEPS ON
ASKING, "WHERE IS IT?"

21:48.089 --> 21:51.135
AND THAT'S THE ONLY
THING I CAN THINK OF.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.355
THAT'S THE ONLY THING.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.143
HUH.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.928
WHAT ARE YOU--

22:11.155 --> 22:13.332
YOU SET THIS UP?

22:13.375 --> 22:15.290
YOU'RE WITH HIM?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.205
OF COURSE I'M WITH HIM.

22:17.248 --> 22:20.339
I LOVE HIM.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.311
CHELSEA?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.444
CHELSEA, HEY.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:38.487 --> 22:41.490
MEDICAL.

22:41.534 --> 22:45.059
HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK,
MASSIVE INJURY
TO THE STOMACH.

22:45.102 --> 22:48.584
JJ, THIS IS
A HIGHWAYMAN'S HITCH KNOT.

22:48.628 --> 22:49.977
IT SELF RELEASES.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.501
BETHANY COULD HAVE
ESCAPED ANY TIME SHE WANTED.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.638
IS SHE AWAKE?

22:58.681 --> 22:59.900
YEAH.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.989
IT WAS BETHANY,
WASN'T IT?

23:03.643 --> 23:06.254
OK, WHO'S THE BOYFRIEND?

23:06.297 --> 23:07.647
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE HEADED TO?

23:07.690 --> 23:09.257
WHERE ARE THEY GOING--

23:11.085 --> 23:13.435
WHAT?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.002
THIS?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.309
GET HER INTO SURGERY.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.020
JJ.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.283
THEY HAD TO INDUCE
A COMA.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.198
AND WE MISJUDGED.

23:37.241 --> 23:40.636
THE BOYFRIEND, WE THOUGHT
HE WAS A TEENAGER, A PEER,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.900
WELL, HE'S OLDER,
MUCH OLDER.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.206
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

23:45.249 --> 23:48.383
CHELSEA SAW THIS
AROUND MY NECK.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.431
THE LOOK IN HER EYES
WAS RECOGNITION.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.216
THE JEWELRY THE UNSUB
GAVE BETHANY.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.913
SAME ONE.

23:56.957 --> 24:02.484
HE GAVE THIS TO ROSLYN
WHO GAVE IT TO ME.

24:02.528 --> 24:06.227
GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW MANY
OTHER GIRLS THERE'S BEEN
SINCE THEN.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.230
I HAVE BEEN WEARING
THIS AROUND MY NECK,

24:09.273 --> 24:11.362
HIS TROPHY,
THIS WHOLE TIME.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.234
JJ, WE WILL ARREST HIM.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.540
I KNOW.

24:14.583 --> 24:18.108
BUT WHEN WE DO,

24:18.152 --> 24:20.937
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM HIM,

24:20.981 --> 24:24.201
BECAUSE IF I GET A CHANCE,

24:24.245 --> 24:26.987
I SWEAR TO GOD
I WILL KILL HIM.

24:34.211 --> 24:37.780
THIS IS MISLABELED.
UNSUB'S OLDER, PREDATORY.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.869
YEAH. LET'S ADD IT ALL UP.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.742
THE UNSUB GIVES
THE GIRLS HE GROOMS
A NECKLACE.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.353
BUT CHELSEA STOLE BETHANY'S
TO FIGURE OUT WHO HE IS.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.311
AND IT'S THE SMOKING
GUN OF THEIR AFFAIR,

24:47.355 --> 24:49.531
DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO RUIN
HIS LIFE IF DISCOVERED.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.273
SO HE AND BETHANY COME UP
WITH A PLAN TO GET IT BACK.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.057
THIS GUY'S BEEN AT IT
FOR A WHILE.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.103
SO WHO'S
IN BETHANY'S LIFE

24:56.146 --> 24:58.366
WHO ALSO OVERLAPS
WITH JJ'S SISTER?

24:58.409 --> 24:59.889
WELL, THERE'S
ON OBVIOUS SUSPECT.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.282
IT'S TOM DAVIS.
HE'S CHELSEA'S DAD,

25:01.325 --> 25:02.805
AND HE WAS ROSLYN'S
OLD BOYFRIEND.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.198
MATT, LUKE,
BRING HIM IN.

25:04.241 --> 25:06.417
HE HAS AN ALIBI. I WANT
TO STRESS TEST IT.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.334
YOU THINK I DID THIS?

25:10.378 --> 25:12.293
MY DAUGHTER IS FIGHTING
FOR HER LIFE IN THE HOSPITAL.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.861
THE GUY WE'RE LOOKING
FOR HAS BEEN DOING
THIS FOR A WHILE.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.558
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO ROSLYN.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.995
JAREAU?

25:19.039 --> 25:21.520
WE DATED IN THE NINETIES.
I WAS 18.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.130
SIMMONS: OK, SO
HOW ABOUT THIS,

25:23.173 --> 25:25.001
HOW ABOUT YOU TELL US
AGAIN WHERE YOU WERE...

25:25.045 --> 25:26.307
YOU OK WITH THIS?

25:26.350 --> 25:29.353
TOM: I WAS AT HOME
BY MYSELF.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.355
YOU CAN CHECK MY CELL PHONE.
IT'S GOT GPS ON IT.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.836
ALL THAT MEANS IS
THAT YOUR PHONE
STAYED HOME,

25:33.880 --> 25:35.577
NOT THAT YOU DID.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.408
HOW HE RESPONDS TO
MY SISTER'S NECKLACE

25:40.451 --> 25:42.366
WILL TELL US EVERYTHING.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.418
JJ, THANK GOD.
CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN--

25:50.461 --> 25:53.247
WE PULLED THIS
OFF OF BETHANY.

25:53.290 --> 25:56.337
WHAT IS IT?

26:09.393 --> 26:10.873
IT'S NOT HIM.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.483
WE'RE HOLDING HIM
ANYWAY.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.660
FINE, BUT IT'S NOT HIM.

26:19.403 --> 26:23.364
BETHANY: IT'S ME.
I'M ON THE BURNER PHONE.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.281
I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.370
IT'S AT THE SCHOOL.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.590
YEAH, I'M HERE NOW.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.331
I CAN GET IT, BUT...

26:34.375 --> 26:36.943
YOU PROMISE TO
TAKE CARE OF ME?

26:36.986 --> 26:39.815
YOU PROMISE?

26:39.859 --> 26:41.730
I, UH,

26:41.774 --> 26:43.732
I HAD TO STAB CHELSEA.

26:43.776 --> 26:48.041
I THINK SHE--
I THINK SHE'S...

26:48.084 --> 26:51.218
YEAH, OK.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.416
EMILY SEND YOU IN HERE?

27:15.459 --> 27:17.244
NO.

27:17.287 --> 27:21.248
WELL, I MIGHT HAVE
MENTIONED I WAS GONNA

27:21.291 --> 27:23.380
CHECK UP ON YOU.

27:26.383 --> 27:29.735
YOU KNOW, OF ALL
THE PROFILERS I'VE
WORKED WITH,

27:29.778 --> 27:31.693
YOU'VE GROWN THE MOST,

27:31.737 --> 27:36.132
FROM COMMUNICATIONS
LIAISON TO MOTHER

27:36.176 --> 27:38.221
TO PROFILER.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.789
IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE
TO WATCH.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.445
THANK YOU.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.752
OH, I'M NOT DONE.

27:46.795 --> 27:50.016
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE
TO DO THE HARD WORK.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.108
IF THIS UNSUB WAS
IN ROSLYN'S LIFE,

27:55.151 --> 27:58.372
HE WAS ALSO IN YOURS.

27:58.415 --> 28:01.331
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DIG INTO YOUR MEMORIES

28:01.375 --> 28:03.159
TO FIND HIM.

28:11.124 --> 28:13.300
WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

28:19.001 --> 28:21.612
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

29:01.565 --> 29:06.440
YOU'RE 11.
THAT'S A FUN AGE.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.137
YEAH.

29:08.181 --> 29:11.140
WHAT WAS GOING ON?

29:11.184 --> 29:14.230
MY PARENTS WEREN'T
DOING WELL.

29:15.623 --> 29:18.452
THERE WAS A LOT OF FIGHTING.

29:18.495 --> 29:22.630
DID THAT CONTRIBUTE
TO ROSLYN'S DEPRESSION?

29:22.673 --> 29:24.327
IT DID.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.202
BUT SHE'D ALWAYS
MAKE TIME FOR ME.

29:33.859 --> 29:37.427
ROSSI: DID SHE EVER LET
ON THAT SHE WAS HURTING?

29:37.471 --> 29:41.780
JJ: YEAH. IT GOT REALLY BAD
RIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS GONE.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.564
IT'S DINNERTIME,
MOM SAYS.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.305
JJ, NOT NOW.

29:45.348 --> 29:48.438
YOU HAVE TO COME EAT
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
EATEN IN 3 DAYS.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.789
GET OUT!

29:55.184 --> 29:57.447
WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?

29:57.491 --> 29:59.798
IS IT TOM?

29:59.841 --> 30:02.061
NO.

30:02.104 --> 30:04.019
I BROKE UP WITH TOM
MONTHS AGO.

30:04.063 --> 30:06.152
WILL YOU JUST
GO AWAY, PLEASE?

30:10.765 --> 30:12.941
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

30:12.985 --> 30:15.639
WEEKS EARLIER SHE
AND MY FATHER WERE FIGHTING.

30:15.683 --> 30:16.727
ROSLYN: YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, DAD.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.207
WE'RE IN LOVE.
HE LOVES ME.

30:18.251 --> 30:19.861
DAD: ROSLYN, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT LOVE IS.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.167
YOU DON'T GET IT!

30:24.605 --> 30:27.608
IF SHE HAD ALREADY
BROKEN UP WITH TOM,

30:27.651 --> 30:29.871
WHO WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

30:29.915 --> 30:31.525
THE UNSUB.

30:31.568 --> 30:35.050
HE RECOGNIZED
A GIRL IN PAIN,

30:35.094 --> 30:38.749
PARENTS DIVORCING,
VULNERABLE,

30:38.793 --> 30:41.448
SO HE TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF THAT.

30:41.491 --> 30:45.539
SHE WAS ALREADY IN
SUCH A BAD PLACE.

30:45.582 --> 30:48.150
AND NOW SHE'S HEARTBROKEN.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.765
SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS
ONLY ONE WAY OUT.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.640
BUT THERE'S THAT NAGGING
QUESTION, ISN'T THERE?

31:01.642 --> 31:04.384
WHY DID YOU GIVE THIS
TO ME, ROZ?

31:04.427 --> 31:06.821
GO BACK TO WHEN
SHE GAVE IT TO YOU.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.606
GO THERE RIGHT NOW.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.221
ROSLYN: I WANT YOU
TO HAVE IT.

31:15.264 --> 31:17.614
BUT YOU LOVE
THIS NECKLACE.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.355
ARE YOU SURE?

31:19.399 --> 31:21.096
I'M SURE.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.190
BECAUSE NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

31:28.234 --> 31:30.714
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, JJ.

31:34.283 --> 31:39.636
AND BESIDES, THIS NECKLACE
WILL HELP WARD OFF THE TALL MAN.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.725
THAT'S A STUPID,
MADE-UP STORY.

31:41.769 --> 31:44.772
THE STORY'S MADE UP,
BUT SOME MONSTERS ARE REAL.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.602
AND IF A REAL MONSTER
EVER SEES YOU WEARING THIS,

31:48.645 --> 31:51.039
HE'LL KNOW NOT TO MESS
WITH JENNIFER JAREAU...

31:53.607 --> 31:54.956
'CAUSE SHE'S A TOTAL BAD ASS.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.133
YOU THINK I'M
A BAD ASS?

31:58.177 --> 32:00.440
I THINK YOU'RE
THE BADDEST OF ASSES.

32:00.483 --> 32:01.702
AND THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.493
SHE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.974
YES, SHE WAS.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.890
NOW IMAGINE YOU'RE
THE UNSUB.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.153
YOUR VICTIM HAS JUST
KILLED HERSELF,

32:18.197 --> 32:20.851
AND YOU SEE HER
YOUNGER SISTER

32:20.895 --> 32:23.419
WEARING YOUR GIFT TO HER.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.726
HE'D SEE IT AS A BEACON.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.858
THAT'S MY NEXT VICTIM.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.643
YOU SAY THAT AS
A PROFILER.

32:29.686 --> 32:33.255
BUT WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT PREFERENTIAL
SEXUAL OFFENDERS?

32:33.299 --> 32:35.779
THEY...

32:35.823 --> 32:37.868
THEY HAVE
AN AGE-SPECIFIC TYPE.

32:37.912 --> 32:39.783
I'D BE TOO YOUNG FOR HIM.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.786
ROSLYN DIDN'T KNOW THAT,
BUT SHE KNEW THE UNSUB,

32:42.830 --> 32:44.701
AND SHE KNEW YOU.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.921
SHE KNEW THAT DEEP
DOWN INSIDE,

32:46.965 --> 32:49.054
YOU WERE STRONGER
THAN HER,

32:49.097 --> 32:51.317
AND THAT THE UNSUB WOULD
NEVER COME AFTER YOU

32:51.360 --> 32:52.883
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
TOO RISKY.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.320
YOU WERE TOO TOUGH.

32:54.363 --> 32:57.671
NOW, WAS THAT THE
BEST PLAN? NO.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.456
BUT IT WAS THE BEST
THAT ROSLYN COULD DO.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.981
AND I THINK
HER PLAN WORKED.

33:03.024 --> 33:07.159
I THINK HE WAS
TERRIFIED OF WHAT SHE
MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU

33:07.202 --> 33:09.030
AND HOW YOU WOULD HAVE
LOOKED AT HIM.

33:09.074 --> 33:13.904
SO WHO LOOKED AT YOU
LIKE THAT GROWING UP?

33:15.732 --> 33:17.691
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A BRIEF INTERACTION,

33:17.734 --> 33:20.172
SOMETHING PROBABLY
IN THE IMMEDIATE

33:20.215 --> 33:22.435
AFTERMATH OF HER DEATH.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.242
OH, MY GOD.

34:06.392 --> 34:09.656
AAH!

34:44.386 --> 34:46.649
THIS IS JUST
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE, OK?

34:46.693 --> 34:47.824
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

34:47.868 --> 34:49.652
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST
BRING ME--DOES JJ--

34:49.696 --> 34:50.914
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:50.958 --> 34:53.221
HEY, LISTEN. LISTEN.
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

34:53.265 --> 34:55.528
I SEARCHED HIS CAR,
HIS HOUSE, AND THE SCHOOL.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.138
NO SIGN OF BETHANY.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.922
DAVE, I THINK HE'LL
RESPOND TO YOUR AUTHORITY.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.185
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
THE FIRST CRACK AT HIM.

35:00.228 --> 35:03.666
ACTUALLY, I'D LIKE TO.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.803
OK.

35:13.023 --> 35:15.243
JJ.

35:15.287 --> 35:17.680
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS THIS? SERIOUSLY.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.291
ETHAN, I AM SO SORRY.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.727
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.511
THEY SEEM TO THINK I'VE
HURT THOSE GIRLS OR SOMETHING.

35:22.555 --> 35:27.081
I KNOW. IT'S JUST
WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR YOUR HOUSE.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.128
AND THEY'VE ALREADY
PULLED YOUR COMPUTER.

35:31.303 --> 35:32.913
IS THAT?

35:32.956 --> 35:34.784
NO, SHE'S BLUFFING.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.264
THAT'S A HELL
OF A BLUFF.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.310
GUYS LIKE HIM KEEP
SOUVENIRS,

35:38.353 --> 35:40.355
USUALLY ON COMPUTERS.

35:46.274 --> 35:47.797
DID YOU SEE WHAT
WAS ON IT?

35:47.841 --> 35:51.671
I DID.

35:56.284 --> 35:58.199
OK, LOOK.

35:58.243 --> 36:02.160
UM, WHAT ROSLYN
AND I HAD,

36:02.203 --> 36:04.292
IT WAS...

36:04.336 --> 36:06.338
IT WAS DIFFERENT.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.819
ALL RIGHT.
I MEAN, WE...

36:09.863 --> 36:11.647
REALLY LOVED EACH OTHER.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.436
I KNOW.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.755
ROZ GAVE THIS TO ME

36:32.799 --> 36:38.631
BECAUSE SHE WANTED ME
TO KNOW HOW SPECIAL
YOU WERE TO HER.

36:38.674 --> 36:41.111
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
IS SPECIAL?

36:43.505 --> 36:45.420
BETHANY.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.381
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME WHERE SHE IS,

36:49.424 --> 36:51.818
BUT YOU GOT TO
GIVE ME SOMETHING

36:51.861 --> 36:54.386
SO I CAN BUY YOU
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

36:59.391 --> 37:03.003
SHE'S WHERE I KEEP
ALL THE KIDS THAT
ARE SPECIAL TO ME.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.228
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.364
YOU MEANT IT, RIGHT?

37:16.408 --> 37:19.498
ABOUT ROZ?

37:19.541 --> 37:21.413
SHE LOVED ME?

37:24.459 --> 37:26.156
SHE'S AT THE SCHOOL.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.257
THIS CAN'T BE IT.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.215
THERE'S NOWHERE
FOR HER TO HIDE
IN HERE.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.438
GUYS, OVER HERE.

37:52.444 --> 37:53.662
WHAT'S UNDER HERE?

37:53.706 --> 37:55.273
THAT'S AN ELECTRICAL
BREAKER ROOM.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.535
THE POLICE, THEY
CLEARED IT ALREADY.

37:56.578 --> 37:57.666
WELL, WE NEED
TO CLEAR IT AGAIN.

37:57.710 --> 37:58.885
ALL RIGHT.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.408
I GOT IT.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.062
GO AHEAD.

38:17.556 --> 38:18.600
GUYS.

38:29.611 --> 38:30.438
COME ON.

38:30.482 --> 38:32.179
BETHANY.

38:32.222 --> 38:33.354
OK, COME ON.

38:33.398 --> 38:36.270
BETHANY?

38:36.314 --> 38:37.445
BETHANY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

38:37.489 --> 38:38.838
HERE WE GO.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.492
COME ON.
COME ON, BETHANY.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.407
UHH! COME ON.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.539

UHH!

39:01.164 --> 39:03.471
UHH!

39:03.515 --> 39:05.343
COME ON.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.480
OH. WERE YOU ABLE
TO BUY ME MORE TIME?

39:12.524 --> 39:14.003
NO.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.483
NO, I DIDN'T.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.879
YOU PUT MY SISTER

39:19.922 --> 39:21.446
IN YOUR TROPHY CASE

39:21.489 --> 39:23.709
BECAUSE SHE WAS
JUST ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR TROPHIES.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.537
NO. THAT'S NOT--
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.147
I DIDN'T--

39:27.190 --> 39:30.498
GAH!

39:30.542 --> 39:33.240
ROSLYN...

39:33.283 --> 39:35.851
PROBABLY WASN'T
YOUR FIRST VICTIM.

39:35.895 --> 39:39.464
BUT BETHANY...

39:39.507 --> 39:42.336
SHE WILL BE YOUR LAST.

40:03.879 --> 40:05.577
COME WITH ME.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.112
HEH.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.906
OH, DON'T...

41:13.949 --> 41:15.995
DON'T MOVE.

41:16.038 --> 41:18.519
LET ME TAKE THIS IN.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.522
THEY WANTED TO WAIT UP.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.698
THEY HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU.

41:23.742 --> 41:25.961
A PRESENT FOR ME?

41:26.005 --> 41:27.746
MM-HMM.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.709
WE HEARD IT THROUGH
THE GRAPEVINE

41:34.753 --> 41:36.711
IT WAS A TOUGH CASE.

41:54.033 --> 41:55.730
YOU LIKE IT?

41:57.950 --> 41:59.908
I LOVE IT.

41:59.952 --> 42:01.780
GOOD.
