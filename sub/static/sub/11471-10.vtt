00:26.911 --> 00:28.629
Evening.

00:28.630 --> 00:30.496
You?

00:31.917 --> 00:34.218
You know, it would be nice
if for just once in my life

00:34.219 --> 00:37.036
a lady wasn't disappointed to see me.

00:38.507 --> 00:40.373
Climb in the back.

00:44.179 --> 00:46.512
Hyah!

00:49.351 --> 00:51.235
Is it much further?

00:51.236 --> 00:54.155
We'll be there in no time.

00:54.156 --> 00:57.441
I'd like to know exactly
where it is we're going.

00:57.442 --> 00:58.993
I'm not gonna say.

00:58.994 --> 01:01.195
Don't you worry. It's safe.

01:01.196 --> 01:03.164
None of your fancy society types

01:03.165 --> 01:07.001
will be taking an evening
stroll anywhere nearby.

01:07.002 --> 01:09.787
But it wouldn't matter.

01:09.788 --> 01:13.207
I've had more than my fair share
of your type needing my services.

01:15.260 --> 01:18.713
- Makes sense.
- In what way?

01:18.714 --> 01:21.882
Well, matters of the flesh.

01:21.883 --> 01:26.270
Don't really matter how fancy
the table is you're sitting at.

01:26.271 --> 01:29.390
Everyone gets hungry.

01:29.391 --> 01:32.109
With the amount of time you rich
ladies spend making yourself pretty,

01:32.110 --> 01:35.312
it's no surprise someone
wanted to put that to good use.

01:35.313 --> 01:39.098
Men, they want what they
want when they want it.

01:40.285 --> 01:42.735
Then you all come to Cleary for the fix.

01:43.739 --> 01:46.773
Hyah.

01:52.581 --> 01:54.715
You promised it wasn't
you who'd perform it.

01:54.716 --> 01:57.585
You can relax. It ain't me.

02:00.505 --> 02:02.372
It's better.

02:08.013 --> 02:10.981
This ain't the place for joking, Cleary.

02:10.982 --> 02:12.817
It ain't no joke, I swear.

02:12.818 --> 02:15.269
She's a paying customer like all the rest.

02:15.270 --> 02:17.104
You're the...

02:17.105 --> 02:19.323
Yes, I'm the one who does it.

02:19.324 --> 02:22.359
You don't want this
rhinoceros doing it, do you?

02:22.360 --> 02:23.994
But you're...

02:23.995 --> 02:27.981
And you're a pretty, proper virgin
on the cusp of her wedding day.

02:32.454 --> 02:34.622
We're friends, Harry.

02:34.623 --> 02:37.675
You could have told me.

02:37.676 --> 02:40.126
So could you.

02:41.513 --> 02:44.330
But then neither of us could, could we?

02:48.270 --> 02:50.554
This is where you leave, Tom.

02:50.555 --> 02:52.972
Ah!

03:01.149 --> 03:03.784
Could have done without
him in the middle of this.

03:03.785 --> 03:06.185
Never wanted him there in the first place.

03:07.322 --> 03:09.373
You don't have to do this.

03:09.374 --> 03:11.408
Yes, I do.

03:11.409 --> 03:13.410
You'll be married soon.

03:13.411 --> 03:15.629
You can tell anyone who can count to nine

03:15.630 --> 03:17.248
that it happened on your wedding night.

03:17.249 --> 03:19.633
I'll be your midwife and vouch
for the baby coming early.

03:19.634 --> 03:22.386
No, this has to happen here tonight.

03:22.387 --> 03:25.973
I can only find the courage to
ask for this just so many times.

03:25.974 --> 03:28.342
At least talk to Phillip about it.

03:28.343 --> 03:31.044
He may see things differently.

03:50.448 --> 03:54.150
I'll get you through it as
quick as I can, little daughter.

03:57.005 --> 03:59.206
A tumor has amassed at
the base of the skull

03:59.207 --> 04:02.209
which is the cause of the
patient's terrible pain.

04:02.210 --> 04:03.711
By trephining,

04:03.712 --> 04:06.680
I hope to relieve some of that pressure.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.022
As you can see, my assessment is correct

04:15.023 --> 04:18.858
as the brain's fluid is immediately
being forced out through the opening.

04:18.860 --> 04:20.593
Syringe.

04:26.534 --> 04:31.488
In order to keep the
intracranial pressure at bay,

04:31.489 --> 04:33.540
it is my opinion

04:33.541 --> 04:35.242
that the hole I've just created

04:35.243 --> 04:39.362
should remain open even
after the operation.

04:43.335 --> 04:46.586
And now on to the tumor.

04:48.673 --> 04:50.790
Surgical knife.

04:52.010 --> 04:54.979
This is our surgical preparation room.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.064
Good afternoon, Doctors.

04:57.065 --> 04:58.766
Good afternoon, Dr. Zinberg.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.351
Taking a tour of our old gal?

05:00.352 --> 05:01.936
She's been through quite a few battles,

05:01.937 --> 05:03.604
but we've managed to keep her afloat.

05:03.605 --> 05:05.638
Isn't that right, Thack?

05:07.158 --> 05:10.995
Dr. Zinberg is making the rounds
at all of the city's hospitals.

05:10.996 --> 05:14.782
He's hoping to promote greater
cooperation between the surgeons.

05:14.783 --> 05:17.451
Curiously, I found our New York brethren

05:17.452 --> 05:21.038
much less willing than my
previous ones in Chicago.

05:21.039 --> 05:24.291
Well, I think that's
changing, thanks to you.

05:24.292 --> 05:26.093
My father and I recently sat in on

05:26.094 --> 05:27.678
the pulmonary abscess procedure you did

05:27.679 --> 05:29.380
on your last visit to New York Hospital.

05:29.381 --> 05:32.683
He used what looked like
this impossible suture

05:32.684 --> 05:35.636
on both layers of the parietal.

05:35.637 --> 05:37.855
It was very, very impressive.

05:37.856 --> 05:41.809
Dr. Zinberg has agreed to perform
a surgery for us here at the Knick.

05:41.810 --> 05:44.611
Really? Who invited him?

05:44.612 --> 05:46.981
Mr. Habershorn from the board.

05:46.982 --> 05:50.534
Seems they've heard wonderful
things from Dr. Zinberg's patron,

05:50.535 --> 05:53.320
Mr. Loeb, and wanted
us to see for ourselves.

05:53.321 --> 05:57.741
Well, you must remind me to
send Mr. Habershorn a note.

05:57.742 --> 06:01.211
Well, you'll be a hard act
to follow, Dr. Thackery.

06:01.212 --> 06:04.331
Your choice of leaving the skull open

06:04.332 --> 06:07.134
is intriguing.

06:07.135 --> 06:09.503
I've always been a believer in osteoplasty,

06:09.504 --> 06:11.422
but this contradicts that.

06:11.423 --> 06:15.843
Well, time will tell if my
contradiction is correct.

06:15.844 --> 06:19.229
Well, naturally, there are
foreseeable complications.

06:19.230 --> 06:22.016
I'd like to try it out
on my next tumor patient.

06:22.017 --> 06:23.984
Modify it.

06:23.985 --> 06:26.353
Perhaps we can share our findings.

06:26.354 --> 06:28.322
If that's all right with you, of course.

06:28.323 --> 06:30.723
No, it's not.

06:36.364 --> 06:39.166
Physicians and other disciplines

06:39.167 --> 06:42.870
believe the mind is not a
place where sickness can fester,

06:42.871 --> 06:45.539
but I assure you it can.

06:45.540 --> 06:47.708
This way, please.

06:47.709 --> 06:50.294
Disorders of the mind must
not be treated casually.

06:50.295 --> 06:52.429
Indeed, we must be aggressive

06:52.430 --> 06:54.348
if our patients are to improve, hmm?

06:54.349 --> 06:56.332
Of course, Dr. Cotton.

06:57.018 --> 06:59.001
Step in.

06:59.971 --> 07:02.022
I'm grateful for you taking on my wife.

07:02.023 --> 07:03.607
Well, it came at the request

07:03.608 --> 07:06.443
of our teacher Dr. Meyer at Johns Hopkins.

07:06.444 --> 07:08.779
There's no man I more admire.

07:08.780 --> 07:11.448
Henry.

07:11.449 --> 07:14.451
Whatever the cost, our
families are willing to pay it.

07:14.452 --> 07:16.570
I want the best possible care for Eleanor.

07:16.571 --> 07:19.156
Oh, well, she's receiving it.

07:19.157 --> 07:21.157
Please.

07:22.827 --> 07:26.078
Eleanor, you have a visitor.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.116
Hello, sweetheart.

07:34.089 --> 07:36.255
Eleanor.

07:40.228 --> 07:42.962
Eleanor, it's me, Everett.

07:46.017 --> 07:49.135
- Everett.
- In God's name...

07:50.488 --> 07:51.772
What in the hell happened?

07:51.773 --> 07:53.323
It's all part of the treatment.

07:53.324 --> 07:55.609
- We pulled all of her teeth.
- Why?

07:55.610 --> 07:58.612
My research has shown conclusively
that all mental disorders

07:58.613 --> 08:01.582
stem from disease and
infection polluting the brain.

08:01.583 --> 08:04.668
So, the teeth and gums are
havens for bacteria and sepsis.

08:04.669 --> 08:08.205
Thus to cure the patient, we must rid
the body of all sites of infection.

08:08.206 --> 08:09.873
But her teeth? She is a beautiful woman.

08:09.874 --> 08:12.176
Who has gone mad.

08:12.177 --> 08:14.845
Now, you must see this as a kindness.

08:14.846 --> 08:16.630
Her teeth had to go.

08:16.631 --> 08:18.632
I believe in this treatment so strongly

08:18.633 --> 08:22.251
that I have removed my own children's
teeth as a preventative measure.

08:24.472 --> 08:26.306
So this is common practice?

08:26.307 --> 08:28.892
It is not generally accepted.

08:28.893 --> 08:32.980
My colleagues thus far choose
to remain in the Dark Ages,

08:32.981 --> 08:34.982
but I'm confident when my results come in,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.482
they'll soon adopt my technique.

08:36.484 --> 08:39.369
- Then it's been effective?
- Not as yet.

08:39.370 --> 08:43.606
But we've only begun to
attack the sites of infection.

08:44.876 --> 08:48.712
I think her tonsils and
adenoids will have to come out.

08:48.713 --> 08:50.547
And if that fails to bring improvement,

08:50.548 --> 08:53.083
her colon will have to go as well.

08:55.253 --> 08:57.504
Fuck. Fuck.

08:57.505 --> 08:59.588
Jesus.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.144
Get off him, Junia.

09:04.145 --> 09:06.011
Fuck.

09:07.398 --> 09:09.483
That's more than I expected from you, Herm.

09:09.484 --> 09:12.352
But what I got in my pocket

09:12.353 --> 09:14.905
is less than I expected from you.

09:14.906 --> 09:16.857
You missed a payment again.

09:16.858 --> 09:19.326
I thought after the favor
I did you at the hospital...

09:19.327 --> 09:21.361
You don't miss a payment!

09:21.362 --> 09:23.664
I made that clear, you dim fuck.

09:23.665 --> 09:25.699
And then you come to my place

09:25.700 --> 09:27.417
and blow money on whores?

09:27.418 --> 09:30.704
I just wanted to see my girl.

09:30.705 --> 09:32.706
She's my girl.

09:32.707 --> 09:35.509
They're all my girls!

09:35.510 --> 09:37.544
And that was my money

09:37.545 --> 09:40.347
you spent to plug my girl.

09:40.348 --> 09:42.299
Show him a blue burner, Jimmy.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.218
- No, no, no, no.
- Take 'em away!

09:44.219 --> 09:46.553
Or I'll give you 10 like you won't forget.

09:46.554 --> 09:48.472
Please. Ah!

09:48.473 --> 09:51.058
Oh, fuck.

09:51.059 --> 09:53.644
Nothing breaks a man
like a good cock punch.

09:55.230 --> 09:57.781
Seen it kill a fella once.

09:57.782 --> 10:02.067
Your change purse seems to be
holding its own, though, Herm.

10:03.288 --> 10:04.871
But it's swelling.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.990
To the size of a billposter's bucket.

10:09.077 --> 10:11.745
I'm tacking on a grand for being late

10:11.746 --> 10:16.081
and doubling your rate for
it being a repeated offense.

10:21.839 --> 10:23.674
I'll get some ice.

10:25.810 --> 10:27.427
Stir that gravy, Duchess.

10:27.428 --> 10:29.616
Don't want the sugar in there to candy up.

10:29.617 --> 10:30.430
Yes, ma'am.

10:30.431 --> 10:33.650
Joella, take that turkey
out, but don't carve it yet.

10:33.651 --> 10:36.153
That meat needs to rest.

10:36.154 --> 10:38.939
Algie, you come to help your mama?

10:38.940 --> 10:41.441
Oh, I'd only get in the way.

10:41.442 --> 10:42.943
Don't let him fool you, girls.

10:42.944 --> 10:45.445
This boy can cook as good
as his mama taught him to.

10:45.446 --> 10:49.783
Glazes a ham better than any
of them chefs over in Paris.

10:49.784 --> 10:53.620
Thought I'd come by a little
early for the lunch today.

10:53.621 --> 10:55.756
Is Cornelia out of her room yet?

10:55.757 --> 10:58.625
Woke up feeling bad. Been
sitting in the parlor.

10:58.626 --> 11:01.094
Girl has the wedding jitters if you ask me.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.679
I'll check on her.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.297
Always so considerate.

11:21.983 --> 11:24.618
No one can see in.

11:24.619 --> 11:26.936
They can all see in.

11:30.992 --> 11:32.858
Are you...

11:35.246 --> 11:37.246
are you all right?

11:38.966 --> 11:41.083
It's done.

11:45.256 --> 11:47.423
Was it terrible?

11:49.894 --> 11:52.511
It was our child.

11:56.484 --> 11:58.268
I wanted to be there with you.

11:58.269 --> 12:01.220
I did. But I couldn't.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.723
You understand?

12:08.413 --> 12:11.397
I think we made a mistake.

12:15.787 --> 12:19.373
- Yes, our affair was the mistake.
- No.

12:19.374 --> 12:22.092
You were looking for a risk to
take and I just happened to be it.

12:22.093 --> 12:24.344
- No, that is not true.
- That is true.

12:24.345 --> 12:27.130
Now we are living with
the consequences of that.

12:27.131 --> 12:29.266
And we should be grateful

12:29.267 --> 12:31.584
to have escaped with our skin.

12:32.854 --> 12:34.388
Now we have to be realistic.

12:34.389 --> 12:35.639
I don't want to be realistic.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.058
You never have wanted to be realistic.

12:40.111 --> 12:42.612
You will marry Phillip.

12:42.613 --> 12:44.398
He's a good man and the two of you

12:44.399 --> 12:47.367
will have many splendid,
healthy children together.

12:47.368 --> 12:49.236
And this...

12:49.237 --> 12:51.955
all of this mess will barely be a memory.

12:51.956 --> 12:53.707
No.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.542
I don't think I should
attend the luncheon today.

12:55.543 --> 12:58.444
Please convey my regrets.

13:00.415 --> 13:03.800
In front of you is a man, age 32,

13:03.801 --> 13:06.253
suffering from splenic anemia.

13:06.254 --> 13:10.090
Now this is evident in the slight
green coloration of the skin.

13:11.559 --> 13:13.560
This disease is rare,

13:13.561 --> 13:16.596
insidious, and up until now

13:16.597 --> 13:19.548
prognosis was anything but hopeful.

13:21.018 --> 13:22.769
Unfortunately, gentlemen,

13:22.770 --> 13:25.439
it is only too true that the entire subject

13:25.440 --> 13:27.607
of blood making and blood breaking

13:27.608 --> 13:31.443
is as yet very imperfectly understood.

13:32.246 --> 13:35.282
But I believe the answer lies

13:35.283 --> 13:38.952
right in the name of the disease itself...

13:38.953 --> 13:40.704
the spleen.

13:40.705 --> 13:43.457
I thought you were at
lunch at the Robertsons'.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.009
This seemed more interesting.

13:46.010 --> 13:48.678
Where are the atomizers?

13:48.679 --> 13:50.797
He doesn't use them.

13:50.798 --> 13:53.633
He says they're as modern as dinosaurs.

13:53.634 --> 13:56.636
I am now going to separate the spleen

13:56.637 --> 13:59.723
from the splenic artery.

13:59.724 --> 14:01.308
Suction.

14:01.309 --> 14:03.342
More clamps, if you please.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.150
We are through.

14:21.579 --> 14:24.548
The patient still has a long road

14:24.549 --> 14:26.716
of convalescing ahead of him.

14:26.717 --> 14:29.719
And we have a long road ahead of us

14:29.720 --> 14:31.922
in fully understanding this disease

14:31.923 --> 14:34.841
and how our blood behaves.

14:34.842 --> 14:38.061
However, we may not be as far off

14:38.062 --> 14:40.096
as we once believed.

14:40.097 --> 14:43.567
My distinguished colleague
Dr. Karl Landsteiner of Vienna

14:43.568 --> 14:45.936
and I have been working together.

14:45.937 --> 14:49.189
And if our experiments
continue to prove successful,

14:49.190 --> 14:52.108
we will soon propose to you, gentlemen,

14:52.109 --> 14:55.445
that we are not of all the same blood,

14:55.446 --> 14:57.197
but, in fact,

14:57.198 --> 15:00.200
of three distinct bloods.

15:08.376 --> 15:13.579
The question is why do transfusions fail?

15:14.715 --> 15:16.433
Multiple reasons.

15:16.434 --> 15:18.768
The principle being
that the transfused blood

15:18.769 --> 15:21.221
begins clotting in the new body,

15:21.222 --> 15:23.023
immediately killing the recipient.

15:23.024 --> 15:26.726
And that is where we'll
start unlocking the mystery.

15:26.727 --> 15:29.428
I'll need both your bloods.

15:30.231 --> 15:31.364
For what purpose?

15:31.365 --> 15:33.066
For the purpose of beating Zinberg

15:33.067 --> 15:35.785
and not allowing him to
bask in another triumph.

15:35.786 --> 15:38.238
This is one of the main
focuses of his research.

15:38.239 --> 15:40.907
He's already around the track
and we are at the starting line.

15:40.908 --> 15:43.126
Look, the man upstaged us
at the medical conference.

15:43.127 --> 15:45.295
Our exceptional hernia presentation

15:45.296 --> 15:48.081
had to play second fiddle to his gadget.

15:48.082 --> 15:50.417
He then arrives at our
theater acting all innocent

15:50.418 --> 15:52.886
when it is clear that his only intention

15:52.887 --> 15:55.388
is to spy and to steal.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.642
There is a difference between
wishing to learn and collaborate

15:58.643 --> 16:01.394
and looking to steal another man's work.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.295
Zinberg is a thief!

16:04.482 --> 16:07.267
He's a fake.

16:07.268 --> 16:09.235
He steals other people's work

16:09.236 --> 16:10.770
and he passes it off as his own.

16:10.771 --> 16:13.607
And I am not allowing him to do it again.

16:13.608 --> 16:17.694
From now on, this will be my main focus.

16:17.695 --> 16:19.529
Beginning today, Dr. Edwards,

16:19.530 --> 16:21.615
you will take the lead in all surgeries

16:21.616 --> 16:24.316
while I concentrate on this.

16:25.002 --> 16:28.203
Um, until when?

16:29.290 --> 16:33.292
Until we win one of those new Nobel Prizes.

16:37.465 --> 16:39.132
Dr. Thackery.

16:39.133 --> 16:42.602
Dr. Thackery, you need to take a moment

16:42.603 --> 16:44.521
and consider yourself.

16:44.522 --> 16:47.440
You are, if I may say, acting irrationally.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.943
And I... I think the cause

16:49.944 --> 16:53.812
may be more pharmaceutical
in nature than you realize.

16:54.649 --> 16:57.567
I did not ask what you think.

16:57.568 --> 17:01.186
I told you what to do.

17:06.410 --> 17:08.328
- Bertie.
- Yes?

17:08.329 --> 17:10.279
Come here.

17:12.883 --> 17:14.718
You much of a bleeder?

17:14.719 --> 17:18.003
- I don't believe so.
- Hold still.

17:18.005 --> 17:19.556
Okay.

17:19.557 --> 17:22.175
Oh! Ow! Yes.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.011
I'm gonna need you for
a special assignment.

17:25.012 --> 17:26.813
Okay.

17:26.814 --> 17:29.849
You've got to find out
everything you can about Zinberg.

17:29.850 --> 17:33.937
What he's doing, how far
along he is in his research.

17:33.938 --> 17:35.355
How?

17:35.356 --> 17:38.024
Well, he's a man who believes in sharing.

17:38.025 --> 17:40.076
Test that theory.

17:44.081 --> 17:46.732
I need to speak with you urgently.

17:47.835 --> 17:49.952
In private.

17:51.706 --> 17:53.757
I want you to introduce
me to your Chinaman.

17:53.758 --> 17:55.208
Who?

17:55.209 --> 17:58.545
The one they brought in here
after you saved his life.

17:58.546 --> 18:01.715
I need you to call in
the favor he owes you.

18:01.716 --> 18:04.300
Why? For what?

18:04.301 --> 18:07.753
I want him to kill Bunky Collier for me.

18:14.478 --> 18:16.813
What are you talking about?

18:16.814 --> 18:19.399
You have to ask him for me.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.068
I have no choice.

18:22.069 --> 18:24.320
What is this? What have...

18:24.321 --> 18:26.905
what have you gotten yourself into?

18:28.242 --> 18:30.243
I owe him.

18:30.244 --> 18:33.079
I owe him nearly $10,000

18:33.080 --> 18:35.749
and it's growing every day.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.501
Every minute that we stand here,

18:38.502 --> 18:43.173
I'm incurring more debt than any
man could fairly pay in a lifetime.

18:44.759 --> 18:49.479
And you want me to ask a favor of Ping Wu?

18:49.480 --> 18:52.315
You're talking about bargaining
with the devil, Herman.

18:52.316 --> 18:55.935
You know, Wu is not a
man to get involved with.

18:55.936 --> 18:58.404
He doesn't believe he can die.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.973
And from the scars on him,
he might be telling the truth.

19:08.282 --> 19:10.116
Oh.

19:10.117 --> 19:12.952
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

19:12.953 --> 19:14.370
Ivory?

19:14.371 --> 19:16.289
Yes, it's carved from the tusk

19:16.290 --> 19:19.843
of the elephant Frederick
shot on safari last year.

19:19.844 --> 19:22.327
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:23.347 --> 19:25.664
Perfectly exquisite.

19:30.721 --> 19:34.140
And now for something old.

19:34.141 --> 19:36.341
Eunice.

19:47.655 --> 19:50.123
Oh, they're stunning.

19:50.124 --> 19:53.326
They belonged to Hobart's mother,

19:53.327 --> 19:55.211
Phillip's grandmother.

19:55.212 --> 19:59.197
It was Hobart who thought
you'd look beautiful in them.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.669
Thank you.

20:02.670 --> 20:04.536
Use them well.

20:05.973 --> 20:08.206
I will.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.550
Everett.

20:19.353 --> 20:21.720
Everett.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.829
What the hell?

20:29.830 --> 20:32.916
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, stop this right now!

20:32.917 --> 20:35.585
What is going on here?

20:35.586 --> 20:37.503
He attacked me!

20:37.504 --> 20:40.039
- You destroyed my life!
- You destroyed yourself.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.543
Dr. Gallinger, you are
suspended from service

20:43.544 --> 20:46.128
until you straighten yourself out.

20:51.218 --> 20:53.418
Everett.

20:54.638 --> 20:56.755
Everett.

21:01.278 --> 21:04.147
- For God's sake, man...
- John, you gave up on me.

21:04.148 --> 21:06.232
Edwards was not my
hire. You were my choice.

21:06.233 --> 21:07.734
And if you had to make that choice again,

21:07.735 --> 21:10.153
would I still be it?

21:10.154 --> 21:11.654
I didn't think so.

21:11.655 --> 21:14.874
Take some time. Go home, collect yourself.

21:14.875 --> 21:18.161
Come back a new man who can
give Edwards a run for his money.

21:18.162 --> 21:20.112
Go home to what?

21:21.248 --> 21:23.082
You were all I had left.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.283
Now look at you.

21:54.164 --> 21:56.199
Don't you look antiseptic.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.285
Perhaps you can complete your
task by sneezing into my patient.

21:59.286 --> 22:03.089
Earlier, you spoke of the
coagulation problem in transfusion.

22:03.090 --> 22:04.924
Now it's been accepted into fact

22:04.925 --> 22:08.878
that normal blood takes
9.28 minutes to coagulate.

22:08.879 --> 22:12.215
You are conversing with me
about your experiments now?

22:12.216 --> 22:14.851
How much more evidence of your
absurd behavior do you need?

22:14.852 --> 22:17.387
I am on to something that cannot wait.

22:17.388 --> 22:21.190
So normal blood takes
9.28 minutes to coagulate,

22:21.191 --> 22:24.777
but if you administer citric
acid, then that time increases.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.980
That could mean that each individual

22:26.981 --> 22:29.148
has varying levels of
citric acid in their blood

22:29.149 --> 22:31.016
which we have yet to discover.

22:32.536 --> 22:36.072
Yes, but the coagulation time also
increases with certain diseases.

22:36.073 --> 22:38.658
Tuberculosis or leukemia, for example.

22:38.659 --> 22:39.993
And decreases with others.

22:39.994 --> 22:41.995
How do you explain that, then?

22:41.996 --> 22:44.362
Silk suture, please.

23:00.014 --> 23:03.381
I want blood samples
from everyone on the ward.

23:07.988 --> 23:11.273
Not the patients. The
nurses and the orderlies.

23:15.946 --> 23:19.032
I'm glad you contacted me, Dr. Chickering.

23:19.033 --> 23:23.036
Well, my father's been after
me about it for a while now.

23:23.037 --> 23:27.707
Well, he only wants a
good situation for you.

23:27.708 --> 23:30.209
And I have that with Thackery.

23:30.210 --> 23:32.045
Yet here you sit.

23:33.714 --> 23:35.298
I won't take a pupil from his mentor,

23:35.299 --> 23:38.134
despite your father's request that I do so.

23:38.135 --> 23:41.270
Well, he doesn't quite understand.

23:41.271 --> 23:43.556
Dr. Thackery must be a good man

23:43.557 --> 23:47.310
and an excellent influence
for you to have such loyalty.

23:47.311 --> 23:50.563
I wanted to collaborate with Thackery.

23:50.564 --> 23:53.449
Your brain surgery, our blood work.

23:53.450 --> 23:56.119
Your hernia and previa
procedures, our endoscope.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.371
We could have been excellent partners.

23:58.372 --> 24:01.874
I don't think Thackery
believed you were being sincere.

24:01.875 --> 24:05.078
I only want to solve
problems and help people.

24:05.079 --> 24:07.497
I'm sure Dr. Thackery feels similarly.

24:07.498 --> 24:09.582
Of course.

24:09.583 --> 24:12.085
We're close on the blood types.

24:12.086 --> 24:14.087
We're learning more every day.

24:14.088 --> 24:18.307
Imagine being able to safely transfuse.

24:18.308 --> 24:21.710
The lives saved. But we're stuck.

24:22.930 --> 24:25.014
The final hurdle is
proving harder to negotiate

24:25.015 --> 24:26.881
than we imagined.

24:29.153 --> 24:31.154
What's this?

24:31.155 --> 24:34.323
It's what I was going to present
to the next society meeting.

24:34.324 --> 24:36.192
It's what we have so far.

24:36.193 --> 24:40.246
Call it a show of good faith.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.448
I'm not concerned with who figures it out

24:42.449 --> 24:44.649
as long as it gets solved.

24:48.422 --> 24:50.456
I don't know what to say.

24:50.457 --> 24:52.208
Say you'll help us.

24:52.209 --> 24:54.877
If Thackery agrees to collaborate,

24:54.878 --> 24:57.213
put our minds together and find the answer,

24:57.214 --> 24:59.549
the documents are his.

24:59.550 --> 25:01.800
If not...

25:04.271 --> 25:08.590
I will trust you to do with
them what you think is right.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.028
Why did Thackery not come?

25:12.029 --> 25:14.562
Why did he send you?

25:18.485 --> 25:20.435
Do you mind if we speak alone?

25:39.139 --> 25:42.341
This is not an average request.

25:42.342 --> 25:44.959
Thackery works for me.

25:46.013 --> 25:47.846
And I need to protect him.

25:49.016 --> 25:53.853
And if this goes wrong,
it can't lead back to him.

25:53.854 --> 25:56.438
That's why I'm here instead.

26:00.911 --> 26:03.079
What does he want?

26:03.080 --> 26:06.199
To have you make good

26:06.200 --> 26:09.067
on your debt to him for saving your life.

26:13.624 --> 26:17.460
He owes a great deal of money

26:17.461 --> 26:19.911
to Bunky Collier.

26:21.381 --> 26:24.600
Collier's threatened Thack's life.

26:24.601 --> 26:26.918
Abused him terribly.

26:28.605 --> 26:30.973
He's beaten him,

26:30.974 --> 26:33.726
humiliated him,

26:33.727 --> 26:36.261
and dealt with him unfairly.

26:39.366 --> 26:41.933
He wants Collier dead.

26:45.739 --> 26:49.574
He said that? His words?

26:50.460 --> 26:53.194
Are you sure that's what he wants?

26:54.248 --> 26:56.114
Very.

26:58.919 --> 27:01.587
Let me take you home.

27:01.588 --> 27:04.590
We can sleep and see how it
looks to you in the morning.

27:04.591 --> 27:06.092
He's too far ahead.

27:06.093 --> 27:08.960
He could be getting ready
to publish next week.

27:11.431 --> 27:14.849
Would you fetch me some
of my medicine, please?

27:18.855 --> 27:21.139
What?

27:22.442 --> 27:25.193
I don't like what it's doing to you.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.314
I don't care what you like.

27:30.367 --> 27:32.168
I need to work.

27:32.169 --> 27:33.669
I need to concentrate.

27:33.670 --> 27:36.371
So, please, just do as you're told.

27:38.041 --> 27:41.292
- John...
- Now, Nurse Elkins.

27:57.728 --> 28:00.146
You see what it's doing to him?

28:00.147 --> 28:01.897
I do.

28:01.898 --> 28:03.783
Then leave it here.

28:03.784 --> 28:06.768
- Let him go without it.
- I can't.

28:07.738 --> 28:09.955
You haven't seen the alternative.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.073
I have.

28:13.493 --> 28:15.961
It's much worse.

28:15.962 --> 28:18.162
Excuse me.

28:48.412 --> 28:50.112
Neely, I told him.

28:50.113 --> 28:53.416
I told Phillip if he presented
San Francisco as a fait accompli,

28:53.417 --> 28:58.236
you would feel the way you're feeling now.

29:02.292 --> 29:04.293
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?

29:04.294 --> 29:06.379
Are you getting married tomorrow?

29:06.380 --> 29:09.048
- I have to.
- Neely, don't.

29:09.049 --> 29:12.351
You're a Robertson. There are ways.

29:12.352 --> 29:15.470
Can we talk about you, please?

29:19.776 --> 29:21.894
How are you?

29:21.895 --> 29:23.895
How's San Francisco?

29:28.568 --> 29:32.238
I don't know if you've noticed,

29:32.239 --> 29:34.355
but Dad isn't...

29:35.075 --> 29:36.659
isn't Dad anymore.

29:36.660 --> 29:39.412
He's not...

29:39.413 --> 29:41.779
not the same.

29:42.916 --> 29:45.084
Has something happened between you two?

29:45.085 --> 29:48.254
No. No, I'm talking about the business.

29:48.255 --> 29:52.341
When I arrived in San Francisco,

29:52.342 --> 29:54.677
things were a mess.

29:54.678 --> 29:56.595
I spent most of the last year

29:56.596 --> 29:59.598
trying to renegotiate
some of the deals he made.

29:59.599 --> 30:03.635
They would have proved fatal
to the company if I hadn't.

30:06.106 --> 30:08.157
If that's true,

30:08.158 --> 30:10.475
it makes me sad.

30:12.612 --> 30:14.479
Me, too.

30:28.845 --> 30:30.763
Oh, good morning, miss.

30:30.764 --> 30:32.798
I didn't expect to find you awake.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.717
Couldn't sleep.

30:34.718 --> 30:36.268
It is a big day.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.086
Yes.

31:16.393 --> 31:18.426
After you, sir.

31:38.532 --> 31:40.698
Everything you could ever want.

31:42.035 --> 31:44.086
- Morning, Harry.
- Thomas.

31:44.087 --> 31:46.755
Lot of good stuff in
these Sears catalogues.

31:46.756 --> 31:50.009
Pianos, headstones, ovens.

31:50.010 --> 31:52.211
- You looking for anything?
- What do you mean?

31:52.212 --> 31:54.046
Something for yourself.

31:54.047 --> 31:55.881
Something nice like you always wanted.

31:55.882 --> 31:58.968
Like a fancy table clock

31:58.969 --> 32:01.220
or a repeating rifle.

32:01.221 --> 32:03.355
Why on earth would I want a rifle?

32:03.356 --> 32:04.890
Bears.

32:04.891 --> 32:07.276
- Here?
- It was in the papers.

32:07.277 --> 32:11.113
Pet shop man lost his out of his
front yard in Brooklyn last week.

32:11.114 --> 32:13.782
Attacked a granny and the
postman before they took it down.

32:13.783 --> 32:16.569
Thank you for your kindly
offer, but I'll be fine.

32:16.570 --> 32:20.072
Me, I'm thinking about getting
one of these fancy new automobiles.

32:20.073 --> 32:21.657
Learning to drive it proper.

32:21.658 --> 32:24.326
Only $495.

32:24.327 --> 32:26.462
Says in here all you need

32:26.463 --> 32:28.914
is an electric plug and a... what was it?

32:28.915 --> 32:30.966
- Desire.
- Desire for adventure.

32:32.419 --> 32:35.620
Can you picture me piloting
one of them around the city?

32:36.923 --> 32:39.308
Imagine all the escaped
bears you could find.

32:39.309 --> 32:41.727
I must be going. Enjoy your daydreaming.

32:41.728 --> 32:44.096
Ah, dreaming is for blokes

32:44.097 --> 32:46.432
not smart enough to get what they want.

32:46.433 --> 32:48.434
- Have fun at today's big event.
- Cleary. Pouncey.

32:48.435 --> 32:51.136
Please give Mrs. Robertson
my deepest appreciations.

32:51.821 --> 32:55.773
We are all blessed to
know her this fine day.

33:01.748 --> 33:03.282
Bertie the Wise.

33:03.283 --> 33:05.534
You saw Zinberg?

33:05.535 --> 33:06.835
I did.

33:06.836 --> 33:08.754
- You have information for me?
- I do.

33:08.755 --> 33:10.289
Hold that thought, Dr. Chickering,

33:10.290 --> 33:11.957
because I, as of 6:41 this morning,

33:11.958 --> 33:14.627
have solved this rotten riddle.

33:14.628 --> 33:18.514
See, I at first thought the answer
lay in the blood's coagulability,

33:18.515 --> 33:21.550
but Dr. Edwards showed me
the error of my thinking.

33:21.551 --> 33:23.519
I then began to hypothesize

33:23.520 --> 33:25.187
that the number of red blood cells

33:25.188 --> 33:27.523
per cubic millimeter is
what differentiates us.

33:27.524 --> 33:31.060
But as we know, that number can
fluctuate for multiple reasons...

33:31.061 --> 33:32.645
sickness, altitude...

33:32.646 --> 33:35.064
And aren't there around six million
blood cells per cubic millimeter?

33:35.065 --> 33:38.367
Exactly. And as I was about 9,000 cells

33:38.368 --> 33:41.203
into a count of one of my
samples, I found something.

33:41.204 --> 33:44.488
It's not the number, it's the size.

33:49.663 --> 33:51.664
In some cases,

33:51.665 --> 33:55.300
there were 75% that were 7.5 microns.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.869
In others, it was only 25%.

34:00.140 --> 34:03.175
I studied sample after sample.

34:03.176 --> 34:07.262
And then a beautiful pattern emerged.

34:07.263 --> 34:09.348
Come, take a look.

34:09.349 --> 34:10.933
Come.

34:10.934 --> 34:13.217
Come.

34:15.438 --> 34:17.156
See, this is the group

34:17.157 --> 34:20.159
that was 75% at 7.5 microns.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.025
Look.

34:22.996 --> 34:26.112
Okay, this one is 60%.

34:28.168 --> 34:29.868
Look.

34:29.869 --> 34:32.204
This was 42.

34:32.205 --> 34:34.672
25.

34:34.674 --> 34:38.376
And finally, 18%.

34:39.596 --> 34:41.045
Zinberg was wrong.

34:41.047 --> 34:43.849
It's not three types, it's actually five.

34:43.850 --> 34:45.516
Do you see?

34:45.518 --> 34:47.469
Honestly, no.

34:47.469 --> 34:49.353
It's there, damn it.

34:49.355 --> 34:50.889
I know it's a Sunday,

34:50.889 --> 34:52.891
but that's no reason to
leave your brain in bed.

34:52.891 --> 34:56.643
Come on and wake up. Wake up. Look again.

34:59.149 --> 35:02.767
I doubt even the great Zinberg
will have reached that conclusion.

35:04.070 --> 35:06.071
Has he?

35:06.072 --> 35:08.490
Your look tells me he has.

35:08.491 --> 35:10.608
No, he has not.

35:12.712 --> 35:14.779
So we have won.

35:16.216 --> 35:19.418
What he's found is remarkable.

35:19.419 --> 35:21.752
And he's open to sharing it.

35:23.556 --> 35:27.092
I think he's quite sincere
in his pledge to collaborate,

35:27.093 --> 35:30.562
and if you would just
be willing to share...

35:30.563 --> 35:33.899
Oh, and let him gain the glory
on the backs of our ingenuity?

35:33.900 --> 35:34.566
I honestly do not...

35:34.567 --> 35:36.101
- think that is his intention.
- No, we will be first!

35:36.102 --> 35:39.470
And we will be first without him!

35:40.940 --> 35:42.775
Were you followed?

35:42.776 --> 35:45.611
Followed?

35:45.612 --> 35:48.113
No. What do you mean?

35:48.114 --> 35:52.283
He's got, you know,
people, spies everywhere.

35:55.421 --> 35:57.371
Maybe you're one of them.

36:01.461 --> 36:05.496
Thack, I am no such thing.

36:08.051 --> 36:10.384
And I think you need rest.

36:11.271 --> 36:13.671
All right, you can go.

36:24.150 --> 36:27.286
Did he enlist you in this?

36:27.287 --> 36:29.570
I volunteered.

36:56.850 --> 36:58.734
Can you still do what I asked?

36:58.735 --> 37:00.851
It's all arranged.

37:13.283 --> 37:15.250
She's perfect.

37:15.251 --> 37:18.837
Her anemic condition was
brought about by chlorosis.

37:18.838 --> 37:21.039
They've tried arsenic, bone marrow,

37:21.040 --> 37:23.491
hydrotherapy... nothing's worked.

37:25.044 --> 37:28.013
Maybe we shouldn't interfere.

37:28.014 --> 37:30.382
The patient is sick enough. It seems cruel.

37:30.383 --> 37:33.050
She's got nothing else.
Let's give her a chance.

37:34.470 --> 37:37.972
A transfusion of blood
may be just what's needed.

37:44.814 --> 37:46.398
Well...

37:46.399 --> 37:50.401
this is certainly your lucky day.

37:51.788 --> 37:55.157
When you wake up,

37:55.158 --> 37:57.942
you'll be cured.

38:00.079 --> 38:01.946
Nurse Elkins.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.473
Blood is flowing.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.650
Pulse is rapid.

39:18.491 --> 39:20.074
Pulse is erratic.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.913
Pulse is weakening.

39:31.838 --> 39:34.538
- What's happening?
- It's not working.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.210
I have no pulse.

39:44.934 --> 39:47.601
Fuck.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.056
John.

39:55.778 --> 39:58.062
What have I done?

43:11.557 --> 43:14.059
Excuse me. Excuse me.

43:14.060 --> 43:16.343
Excuse me.

43:17.063 --> 43:19.648
Bertie. Excuse me.

43:19.649 --> 43:22.651
- Bertie.
- Lucy, what's wrong?

43:22.652 --> 43:25.068
It's Dr. Thackery.

43:36.165 --> 43:38.282
Congratulations!

44:09.749 --> 44:11.833
Thackery.

44:11.834 --> 44:14.117
John.

44:15.204 --> 44:16.838
John.

44:16.839 --> 44:19.323
John, it's the drug.

44:20.793 --> 44:22.627
It's destroying you.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.514
John.

44:26.515 --> 44:28.433
You need to stop.

44:28.434 --> 44:30.302
I can't.

44:30.303 --> 44:32.721
- John.
- I can't stop.

44:32.722 --> 44:35.223
We'll find someone who can help you.

44:35.224 --> 44:37.174
Right, Bertie?

44:41.981 --> 44:43.648
So it's all true, then?

44:43.649 --> 44:47.651
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:59.081 --> 45:01.166
Dear God.

45:01.167 --> 45:02.834
- Bertie.
- What?

45:02.835 --> 45:06.721
Please. I don't know what to do.

45:06.722 --> 45:09.174
You think I know what
to do with this madness?

45:09.175 --> 45:11.959
- You have to help him.
- I don't have to do anything!

45:17.350 --> 45:19.550
Please, Bertie.

45:24.190 --> 45:26.557
Whoa.

45:27.326 --> 45:29.361
Mr. Cleary?

45:29.362 --> 45:31.812
- That's me.
- Got something for you.

45:36.919 --> 45:38.169
Thank you.

45:38.170 --> 45:41.071
Hee. Hup.

46:09.235 --> 46:11.435
Sit him up, please.

46:25.918 --> 46:29.286
How much cocaine have you
injected today, Doctor?

46:32.641 --> 46:34.926
12 grams.

46:34.927 --> 46:37.846
That's quite a tolerance.

46:37.847 --> 46:40.432
You've seen people in his condition before?

46:40.433 --> 46:44.602
In my practice, more than a bit these days.

46:44.603 --> 46:47.822
Women of a certain breeding

46:47.823 --> 46:50.474
who have become dependent on the drug.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.644
Can you help him?

46:54.947 --> 46:56.865
In the meantime,

46:56.866 --> 46:59.199
keep him comfortable.

48:55.818 --> 48:58.319
Your man is no more.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.906
He wasn't my man, Mr. Ping.

49:01.907 --> 49:04.492
He was causing Thackery
the trouble, remember?

49:04.493 --> 49:07.078
His request.

49:07.079 --> 49:09.414
And I am sure he'll be grateful

49:09.415 --> 49:11.382
you came by to let us know.

49:14.753 --> 49:17.472
I've known Thackery a long time.

49:17.473 --> 49:20.592
He loves my woman, my opium.

49:20.593 --> 49:23.844
He always pays.

49:26.565 --> 49:28.799
But you...

49:31.320 --> 49:33.605
Where did you get that?

49:33.606 --> 49:36.691
From Collier's desk.

49:36.692 --> 49:40.411
A man who owes me 9,000
as long as you owe Collier

49:40.412 --> 49:41.946
would be fed to my pigs.

49:41.947 --> 49:44.198
That book is not...

49:44.199 --> 49:47.118
I can read left to right,

49:47.119 --> 49:49.486
not just up and down.

49:51.340 --> 49:56.493
This my book now.

50:00.349 --> 50:02.634
I was so close.

50:02.635 --> 50:04.501
What?

50:05.437 --> 50:07.722
What did you just say?

50:07.723 --> 50:10.308
I was so close with that girl.

50:10.309 --> 50:12.360
No, you weren't.

50:12.361 --> 50:14.812
I read Zinberg's papers.

50:14.813 --> 50:17.315
There's nothing to do with
the size of the blood cells.

50:17.316 --> 50:19.400
It has to do with the
agglutinating antibodies.

50:19.401 --> 50:22.704
Certain people have one
type, others another.

50:22.705 --> 50:24.988
You were off by a mile.

50:40.889 --> 50:42.390
Hello.

50:42.391 --> 50:43.841
Dr. Chickering.

50:43.842 --> 50:46.259
I believe Dr. Hackett is expecting us.

50:47.229 --> 50:49.462
Would you empty your pockets, please?

50:57.940 --> 51:01.224
Is there someone you would
like to list as the next of kin?

51:14.206 --> 51:16.457
There's nothing you can do for him now.

51:16.458 --> 51:19.659
There's no use in sitting
there worrying about him.

51:27.302 --> 51:30.021
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs

51:30.022 --> 51:32.974
and we could pay you once
we've charged the patients.

51:32.975 --> 51:35.276
Your patients can't pay.

51:35.277 --> 51:38.146
This has always been the
Church's issue with the Knick.

51:38.147 --> 51:40.531
Your policies create dependency.

51:40.532 --> 51:42.400
Why would they advance us anything?

51:42.401 --> 51:44.285
Our chief surgeon is gone.

51:44.286 --> 51:46.287
His predecessor killed himself.

51:46.288 --> 51:49.624
And the only man left here
with a scalpel is a Negro.

51:49.625 --> 51:52.043
But there is a solution.

51:52.044 --> 51:54.295
Same one we've had all along.

51:54.296 --> 51:57.999
Close the Knick and move uptown.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.718
The decision has to be made now.

52:00.719 --> 52:04.138
Metropolitan Hospital has made
an offer for my land uptown.

52:04.139 --> 52:06.623
I can't hold it for us any longer.

52:08.977 --> 52:11.511
In light of all that's happened here...

52:13.982 --> 52:17.183
I think it's time we bring
this matter to a vote.

52:18.103 --> 52:21.439
All in favor of shuttering this place

52:21.440 --> 52:24.190
and moving the Knick uptown?

52:24.993 --> 52:27.861
Aye.

52:30.082 --> 52:34.200
Then it's decided.

52:40.259 --> 52:43.044
Welcome to Cromartie Hospital.

52:43.045 --> 52:45.263
I'm Dr. Hackett.

52:45.264 --> 52:48.132
When Dr. Chickering Sr.
called ahead on your behalf,

52:48.133 --> 52:51.385
he asked that you be
registered under an alias

52:51.386 --> 52:53.805
to protect your privacy.

52:53.806 --> 52:56.524
Is there a name that you prefer?

52:56.525 --> 52:58.276
Crutchfield.

52:58.277 --> 53:00.093
Excellent.

53:00.979 --> 53:04.180
- Favorite teacher?
- My mother.

53:09.788 --> 53:13.207
You have been steered to the right place.

53:13.208 --> 53:15.076
Thank you.

53:15.077 --> 53:17.378
As our reputation has grown,

53:17.379 --> 53:20.998
we've begun to specialize
in treating cocaine madness.

53:20.999 --> 53:23.751
The withdrawal of the drug from your system

53:23.752 --> 53:25.919
will be the hardest part.

53:28.056 --> 53:30.224
From the looks of you,

53:30.225 --> 53:33.209
you've done enough damage
to yourself already.

53:40.519 --> 53:42.603
We here at Cromartie Hospital believe

53:42.604 --> 53:46.524
that the pain of detoxification

53:46.525 --> 53:49.243
is counterproductive to
restoring your health.

53:49.244 --> 53:52.580
So we have developed a series of treatments

53:52.581 --> 53:55.249
designed to ease your suffering,

53:55.250 --> 53:58.452
including a miraculous medication

53:58.453 --> 54:01.738
that can virtually eliminate
the misery of withdrawal.

54:04.259 --> 54:06.294
Don't worry.

54:06.295 --> 54:11.265
It's from Bayer the aspirin company.

54:11.266 --> 54:13.299
Safe as can be.

54:39.745 --> 54:41.963
Rest assured, these treatments

54:41.964 --> 54:44.664
will only be for the first month or two.

54:50.339 --> 54:52.622
Time to start getting better.
