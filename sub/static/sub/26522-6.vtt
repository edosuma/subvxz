01:39.641 --> 01:42.268
In movies they always say
that they, uh,

01:42.352 --> 01:43.812
look like they're sleeping.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.982
She doesn't look like she's sleeping.
She looks dead.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.486
I mean, you, um...

01:52.237 --> 01:54.614
She looks great.
You did a really good job as usual.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.700
-Thanks.
-But she doesn't look like she's sleeping.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.287
I don't know
why people say that.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.707
Most of what people say
at a funeral is a wish.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.334
"They're...

02:06.960 --> 02:10.880
in a better place, they're at peace,
they're smiling down."

02:10.964 --> 02:12.507
People just wishing out loud.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.550
How bad was it?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.427
I mean, when she...

02:16.886 --> 02:19.055
got here

02:19.848 --> 02:20.974
Are you really asking?

02:23.434 --> 02:24.269
No.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.812
You're right.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.691
You might want to slow down.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.278
It's going to be a long night.
You've been at that all day.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.040
There's a stupid amount of food.
It keeps showing up.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.835
Hope they didn't eat dinner.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.837
-Can I have one?
-Mm-hm.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.714
Should've told them
not to eat dinner first.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.049
There's plenty in the kitchen
if we burn through that.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.970
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.640
Did you connect with a florist
for tomorrow?

03:02.891 --> 03:04.142
Yeah, it's all set.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.435
I promise.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.313
This gonna be a problem for Luke?

03:09.647 --> 03:12.483
If he tries for it,
Steve can take him back to the hotel.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.076
So Luke's fresh off the streets?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.996
Steve says he didn't even have shoes
when he found him.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.080
Great.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.999
We get to watch him come down.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.710
He flies across the country
to puke on his dead sister.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.003
Jesus, Theo.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.924
Might as well hide our purses, though.

03:37.675 --> 03:38.676
What about Dad?

03:38.843 --> 03:41.262
They flew in together, I know that,
so he's here.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.680
Has he been here before?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.515
I was trying to remember that, too.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.142
He hasn't, has he?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.853
-Or if he has, I can't remember it.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.815
I got it. You guys relax.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.819
Please, Luke.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.738
Don't fuck this up.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.661
That's funny, Nellie was always trying
to get all of us together in one place.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.578
Hey.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.830
-Even Dad tried for years.
-Can I get your coat?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.624
Yeah, that would be great.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.628
Someone should've told her
she didn't have to try this hard.

04:13.962 --> 04:14.963
-Hi.
-Hey.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.257
It's pretty bad out there.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.842
It's just a little rain.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.303
Hi, Shirl.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.265
Hey.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.474
Still not a hugger?

04:29.227 --> 04:30.103
Flight's good?

04:30.478 --> 04:32.313
It was...
It was not too bad.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.523
Long.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.363
Dad's not with you?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.616
He's still at the hotel.
He told us to go ahead.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.160
He kept changing his clothes.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.996
He's nervous, I guess.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.581
Luke, can I get you some water
or something to eat?

04:50.665 --> 04:53.001
I've got a mountain of food.
Anything you want.

04:59.048 --> 04:59.966
I'm sorry.

05:00.049 --> 05:03.428
I can't... I can't.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.099
He seems a lot better than I expected.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.270
I think he's, like, actually clean,
a little while now.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.731
-So what was with the jailbreak?
-Long story.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.108
Hey, Luke.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.201
-You okay?
-Yeah.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.953
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I...

05:31.539 --> 05:33.791
I...

05:34.167 --> 05:36.336
I thought... I thought I could do it.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.795
-I know.
-She's right there.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.297
Take your time.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.132
We can wait.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.092
Yeah.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.218
There's no rush.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.720
I...

05:46.012 --> 05:47.513
It's okay. Come on.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.851
So where's Leigh?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.187
What?

05:54.896 --> 05:57.315
Um, she'll be here tomorrow. We're...

05:57.774 --> 05:59.192
We didn't travel together.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.276
Why not?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.404
We're taking a break.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.158
Luke, you sure I can't get you
an ice tea or something?

06:07.408 --> 06:08.785
-That might be good.
-Yeah.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.119
-You want some ice tea?
-Yeah.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.996
That'd be great. Thanks, Kev.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.374
-You're taking a what?
-A break.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.459
-Like a separation?
-Like...

06:16.876 --> 06:18.336
If it's all the same to you,

06:18.419 --> 06:21.130
maybe we can save this conversation
for a little later.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.175
I mean, I think we got bigger things
to tackle tonight

06:24.258 --> 06:26.052
than my marital...

06:27.387 --> 06:31.015
If you were married, you'd know that
sometimes people need a little room.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.519
I mean, Theo, I'm not...

06:34.602 --> 06:36.562
This is coming out wrong. I...

06:36.979 --> 06:40.149
I just think it's not unusual for people
in a relationship as long as us--

06:40.233 --> 06:41.484
I don't care.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.528
-Getting you a drink.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.612
Thank Christ.

06:46.906 --> 06:47.907
Thank you.

06:52.036 --> 06:52.870
Okay.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.456
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.626
Just rip off the Band-Aid.

06:58.709 --> 06:59.752
Yeah, let's...

07:01.212 --> 07:02.422
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.885
I'm with you.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.012
We got this.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.516
It's not as bad as it is
in your head, but

07:13.599 --> 07:15.268
she doesn't look like she's sleeping,

07:15.351 --> 07:16.519
-so forget that.
-Right.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.314
And if you're not ready,
we'll just go back.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.901
-That's all right. Come on.
-Okay.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.552
Yep.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.055
That's... That's her, detective.

07:53.848 --> 07:54.849
Positive.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.726
Positive ID.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.897
That's Nellie, all right,
and she's dead.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.064
Jesus.

08:02.982 --> 08:03.983
Jesus!

08:04.192 --> 08:05.318
Shit, Shirl.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.324
I'm sorry,
I don't know what that was.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.618
I changed every light bulb
in the house this afternoon,

08:13.701 --> 08:15.411
because if one went out
tonight or tomorrow,

08:15.495 --> 08:18.039
I wouldn't have time to change it
with everything going.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.541
It's... It's crazy.

08:22.919 --> 08:23.878
I get it.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.755
-It's... It's crazy.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.548
Right.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.301
We don't have to stay in here.

08:30.927 --> 08:31.886
Let's sit.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.387
-She's okay.
-Yeah.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.555
That'd be good.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.266
Thank you.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.525
I'm drinking every time
I feel like punching something.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.735
It's just not fucking fair.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.904
-Fuck!

08:50.571 --> 08:53.324
-Okay, Steve?
-Yeah, I'll be right there.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.293
Oh, fuck.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.712
Come on,
get it together.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.006
Get it together.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.769
Oh, okay, okay!

09:23.646 --> 09:24.647
Okay.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.650
You okay?

09:27.733 --> 09:28.734
-Huh?
-Spill it.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.028
-What?
-The details.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.156
Um, I-- I don't know
much more than you. I...

09:34.865 --> 09:37.076
She killed herself at that goddamn house.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.705
-I don't think it's that simple.
-Thanks. That clears it all right up.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.666
Listen, I'm not saying it's simple,
that's all I know.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.127
-No, I mean the suicide part.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.671
Luke, she went back
to the house,

09:48.754 --> 09:51.299
she didn't tell anybody,
and she...

09:52.466 --> 09:54.552
-You spoke to the coroner, right?
-Right.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.847
So, you probably know more
than I do.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.684
She... she hung herself.
Her neck was broken.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.104
Her neck?

10:05.479 --> 10:06.397
Here you go.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.774
I still don't get why
she'd go there in the first place.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.320
-Well... Mom.
-She barely remembered Mom.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.738
-Luke...

10:13.863 --> 10:15.364
how much do you remember Mom?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.367
-Yeah, I don't know.
-She was like six years old.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.910
Well, what then, Dr. Crain?

10:21.120 --> 10:21.954
Punch.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.290
I want to know what
Mrs. Dudley said to him.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.375
-Me too.
-He didn't tell you?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.127
What do you think?

10:30.421 --> 10:31.964
Six hours on a plane?

10:32.673 --> 10:33.633
Didn't come up?

10:34.508 --> 10:35.384
No.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.136
Dad was in coach.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.430
Wait...

10:39.764 --> 10:42.516
you put yourself in first class?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.518
I put him there, too.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.687
And made Dad fly coach?

10:46.854 --> 10:48.147
He insisted.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.608
-That's--
-Look, Shirl, he wanted to...

10:50.691 --> 10:52.818
-That's just--
-...pay for his own ticket.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.029
-So, yeah, he was in coach.
-Hmm.

10:56.113 --> 10:59.116
It's not like we were really talking
each other's ears off before that.

11:01.952 --> 11:02.953
God.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.664
I got it.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.050
-Hey, welcome.
-Hi.

11:17.051 --> 11:17.885
Hey.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.470
Boy, it's...

11:19.887 --> 11:22.306
-It's coming down out there.
-Yeah, yeah.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.724
I know, I know, I know.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.811
How are you, Kevin?

11:27.770 --> 11:28.604
I'm...

11:29.480 --> 11:30.439
so sorry.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.192
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.652
Me, too.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.617
Wow.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.416
Sorry, I'm a little late.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.626
That's okay.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.421
How was your flight?

11:53.921 --> 11:54.964
Uh...

11:55.798 --> 11:56.966
Well, it was...

11:58.259 --> 11:59.427
It was...

12:03.180 --> 12:04.014
fine.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.851
-You know.
-Thanks for being here.

12:11.105 --> 12:11.939
Hey.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.650
Thank you.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.485
You have a beautiful home.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.406
This is the business side of the...

12:21.115 --> 12:23.617
the residential side is over in the...

12:25.077 --> 12:25.995
Thank you.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.750
God.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.418
Look at you girls.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.836
It's been a minute.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.504
Yeah, it has.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.048
Longer than a minute.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.301
Or a long...

12:41.343 --> 12:42.720
-minute.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.264
-I'm not sure... which.

12:48.184 --> 12:52.062
Can I get you anything?
We got tons to eat, plenty to drink.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.982
This is Kevin's coping mechanism.
He turns into a waiter.

12:55.983 --> 13:00.404
No, thanks, I'm fine.
I... I don't really know...

13:01.447 --> 13:03.032
what to say...

13:03.783 --> 13:04.700
really.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.786
Other than...

13:08.537 --> 13:10.623
you know, to see all of you
in the same...

13:10.873 --> 13:12.583
room. Well, not all.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.586
I'm just sorry that...

13:16.462 --> 13:18.964
that we have to be here...

13:20.049 --> 13:20.966
under...

13:22.885 --> 13:26.222
Neither can I.
Look at them, they're all grown up.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.516
What?

13:29.391 --> 13:30.267
Hmm?

13:31.685 --> 13:33.020
Under these circumstances,

13:33.103 --> 13:35.064
that we have to be here
under these circumstances--

13:35.147 --> 13:37.608
Wow, well put.
You want to do the eulogy tomorrow?

13:37.691 --> 13:39.443
-'Cause it's--
-You want to go see her?

13:39.527 --> 13:42.029
-Yes, actually, if you'll excuse me.
-Of course.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.364
That's why we're here.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.719
Oh, Shirley.

14:06.887 --> 14:07.763
Shirley.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.642
You...  You did a...

14:13.269 --> 14:14.812
She looks beautiful.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.606
Not too much makeup.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.025
Sometimes they put too much makeup
on them,

14:20.109 --> 14:20.985
but she looks...

14:26.240 --> 14:27.408
You did a...

14:29.076 --> 14:30.035
Thank you for...

14:31.579 --> 14:33.831
taking care of her,
and if there's a...

14:36.083 --> 14:37.042
Is there?

14:37.751 --> 14:39.712
I could use a bathroom.
Where would be the closest?

14:39.795 --> 14:41.130
-Just head up that hall.
-Okay.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.424
-To your left at the end.
-Okay.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.075
Oh, man.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.460
Great.

16:01.835 --> 16:02.670
Honey?

16:03.128 --> 16:05.172
There you are.
You weren't in bed. Where'd you go?

16:05.255 --> 16:06.715
-Jesus Christ.
-Yeah.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.425
Oh, that makes sense.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.260
It sounded like a car crash.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.513
I guess, but I don't know
why it would fall.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.390
Where'd you go?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.935
I don't know, I guess I was wandering.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.311
Maybe I was sleepwalking.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.313
I had the strangest dream.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.148
Jesus Christ!

16:23.232 --> 16:24.483
Honey, don't say that.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.568
-You just said it.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.696
You're right. I'm sorry.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.241
-You guys hear a scary noise?
-So many scary noises.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.159
Yeah. It's okay, see? It was that.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.079
-Someone broke the Sannadeer!
-"Chandelier." It just fell.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.039
-What the hell happened?
-Language.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.833
-We don't know.
-So that explains the noise.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.167
I don't like this.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.004
It's just a silly old storm, sweetheart.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.630
Your mother hates storms, too.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.882
-You do?
-Uh-huh.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.135
Since I was a little girl, just like you.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.178
But you know what storms do?

16:54.179 --> 16:56.515
-Do they pass?
-They pass.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.100
Stevie, give me a hand.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.643
What do you need?

16:59.727 --> 17:00.853
Just grab that other side,

17:00.936 --> 17:03.355
I wanna move this out of the way
so no one's tripping on it.

17:03.647 --> 17:04.481
Got it.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.399
Ready?

17:05.566 --> 17:06.442
Yep.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.318
How did it fall?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.404
Did it get hit by lightning?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.156
No, nothing like that, honey.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.407
Gently, gently.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.200
Okay.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.081
What's that?

17:22.666 --> 17:23.584
That's hail.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.963
Yep, it is.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.217
It's really loud, huh?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.845
All right, come with me.
Let's go sit down.

17:36.972 --> 17:37.890
Hail?

17:37.973 --> 17:41.060
Yeah. Well, sometimes in thunderstorms,

17:41.518 --> 17:45.439
the wind can push the storm
up into the sky really, really high...

17:45.731 --> 17:47.024
and the rain can freeze.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.859
So it's ice?

17:48.942 --> 17:49.818
Exactly.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.779
Explains why my room is freezing.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.157
And the ice balls fall back down to Earth
and they pick up more water

17:55.240 --> 17:57.117
and they get bigger and bigger.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.454
What was that?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.414
Um, sounded like a window.

18:03.040 --> 18:03.999
Which is fine.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.376
-Everything's fine, okay?
-Yeah.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.003
My window just broke.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.713
-Seriously?
-It exploded.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.423
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.717
-Let me go check it out.
-Can I come?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.552
Um, sure.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.056
But the rest of you stay down here
and stay away from the windows.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.141
Watch your step,
there's glass on the floor.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.268
-Like someone threw a rock through it.
-Great.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.312
-Ice.
-The hell happened to the chandelier?

18:25.395 --> 18:26.980
-The wind turned it into ice.
-Hey, Shirl?

18:27.064 --> 18:29.900
Can you do me a favor?
Go in the kitchen and make some cocoa.

18:29.983 --> 18:30.984
Seriously?

18:31.485 --> 18:34.238
You know how to do it
and your brother and sister are scared.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.948
Fine.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.200
-Theo, you can help. Take Luke, too.
-Mom.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.035
Thank you. Go ahead.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.703
-Go with your sisters.
-Come on.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.084
You wearing those gloves
to bed now?

18:47.251 --> 18:48.877
-Wanna play a game?
-Shut up.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.880
So, when there's another
flash of lightning,

18:51.964 --> 18:54.550
let's count how long it takes
until we hear thunder.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.885
That way we can tell how far away it is.

18:56.969 --> 18:57.803
Okay?

18:57.970 --> 19:01.390
So for every five seconds,
that's one whole mile away.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.268
All right, let's wait for the next one.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.437
There.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.440
-Okay, one, two...

19:10.983 --> 19:11.984
Two miles.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.610
Uh, no, okay, not quite.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.988
So, for every five seconds,
that's only one mile away,

19:16.071 --> 19:17.823
so that one was actually closer.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.659
Mom! -It's okay.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.703
-It's just the power.
-Mommy!

19:22.786 --> 19:24.496
The power went out.
I'm right here, you guys.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.081
-Come here.
-It's all right.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.375
-It's a really old house, all right?
-It's all right.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.836
Flashlights in the kitchen.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.671
Okay, you got it?

19:33.380 --> 19:34.381
All right.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.142
Bent-Neck Lady!

19:45.225 --> 19:46.894
-It's okay.
-You guys okay?

19:46.977 --> 19:48.353
-We're okay.
-She's there.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.397
-It's all right. Shh.
-With the statue.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.607
It's all right, baby.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.941
She's here again.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.194
Here, listen to me, my love.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.739
Mommy's seen things, too.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.201
Sometimes Mommy sees people here, too.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.996
But they won't hurt us, okay?
They're not here to hurt us.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.207
What did you see?

20:08.874 --> 20:11.793
-Everybody okay in here?
-We'll talk-- Yeah, everybody's fine.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.213
Well, this one's working,
but these need batteries.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.340
Okay, here. Theo's got you.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.050
-Take your sister's hand.
-Mom.

20:18.133 --> 20:21.720
Just for a second. I'll get a flashlight.
I'll be right back.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.306
All right. I got yours, Luke.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.225
-Let up on my hand.
-Thanks, Steven.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.601
It's just a storm.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.896
-A bad storm.
-Yeah, this wasn't forecast.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.522
-This is nuts.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.233
Your stuff's all wet, Shirl.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.151
The hail's blowing right in the window.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.487
-For real?
-Very helpful, Steve.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.489
We'll figure it out.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.616
-It's kinda fun, huh?
-There you go.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.369
When I was a kid, we used to go
camping all the time.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.620
I was a Life Scout.

20:46.870 --> 20:47.955
What's a Life Scout?

20:48.497 --> 20:49.831
Well, it's a group of...

20:50.582 --> 20:52.417
Anyway, we used to go camping.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.670
And one time there was a storm,

20:54.753 --> 20:57.422
and it was such a bad storm
that we took our packs,

20:57.506 --> 21:00.259
and we tied him to the trees
to keep them from washing away.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.720
-Whoo!
-Stop it!

21:04.137 --> 21:06.306
It's okay, we're totally safe, okay?

21:07.474 --> 21:10.060
-That was a good one, huh?

21:10.352 --> 21:12.020
Are you sure we're safe?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.148
The roof isn't gonna explode
or whatever?

21:15.232 --> 21:17.776
You know what, this house has been here
for a long, long time.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.320
It's seen plenty of storms
and worse than this.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.572
-It's gonna keep us safe.
-Yeah.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.075
-I thought you hated this house.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.413
-That's something, anyway.
-Uh-huh.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.373
Okay, one...

21:32.165 --> 21:34.876
-Two, three...
-Two, three...

21:35.711 --> 21:36.586
See?

21:37.004 --> 21:37.963
It's moving away.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.882
What'd I tell you, Nellie?
That's what storms do, they...

21:42.175 --> 21:43.176
Where's your sister?

21:44.594 --> 21:45.429
Theo?

21:45.929 --> 21:48.890
She was right there.
I was holding her hand the entire time.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.434
Okay.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.352
-Nellie?
-The whole time,

21:52.436 --> 21:54.062
I could feel her hand until I looked down.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.064
Nellie - Nellie?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.485
Nellie

22:01.862 --> 22:04.448
Where could she have gone?
It was only a few seconds.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.116
Maybe she went to her room.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.034
Maybe.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.038
-I could feel her hand the entire time--
-I know, it's not your fault.

22:11.121 --> 22:11.955
Nellie!

22:12.039 --> 22:14.416
-We're gonna find her.
-What if something gets her?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.252
I know you're scared, pal.
I know you are.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.255
-Nell, come on out.
-Listen, she's just hiding from the storm.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.382
-She's probably in her room under her bed.
-Yeah.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.801
We'll go and find her,
we'll bring her back, okay?

22:25.844 --> 22:28.013
-Maybe we should...
-My sweet boy. Yes.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.016
Ah, Steve, okay,
you keep an eye on everyone.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.518
-We'll be right back.
-Yeah, we'll be back in a bit.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.896
You guys stay here and stay away
from the windows.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.481
Keep hold of your flashlights.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.149
You think she went upstairs?

22:39.232 --> 22:41.401
We would've seen her
if she went for the halls.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.487
-Nell, come on out, it's okay.
-Don't worry, my man.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.947
-She's gonna be okay.
-How do you know?

22:46.114 --> 22:48.367
'Cause, I won't let anything
happen to her.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.243
To any of you guys.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.162
That's my whole job.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.206
First thing they teach us
in Big Brother School.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.123
Nell?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.459
I'm with you.

22:58.001 --> 22:58.960
We got this.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.004
Okay?

23:02.130 --> 23:04.257
Luke. Luke.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.052
Luke.

23:07.969 --> 23:08.845
Luke?

23:09.679 --> 23:10.764
Luke.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.975
Do you remember what it was,
that word she made up?

23:15.185 --> 23:16.812
-I'm not sure.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.106
This made-up word.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.901
Aunt Janet kept correcting her
and she just went on using it.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.529
-What the hell was that word?
-Trying to remember.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.742
Doesn't matter. Finally Aunt Janet...

23:31.493 --> 23:36.039
she gets fed up and tells Nellie to stop
using whatever it was and speak properly.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.917
"You're ten years old, speak properly."

23:40.460 --> 23:42.587
And Nellie just... looks at her.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.965
like beyond her years, patient...

23:45.215 --> 23:47.175
and asks what she's doing wrong.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.138
And Aunt Janet says,
"It's a made-up word."

23:52.556 --> 23:54.975
And Nellie looks her right in the eye
and says...

23:55.350 --> 23:57.978
"All words are made-up at first."

23:58.103 --> 24:00.522
God, I wish I could
remember what the...

24:00.939 --> 24:01.982
that word.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.233
"Puffalope."

24:04.443 --> 24:06.611
That's it. Puffalope.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.030
Padded, puffy envelope.

24:09.823 --> 24:10.866
"Puffalope."

24:12.284 --> 24:15.078
She would say she was running out
of puffalopes for her letters

24:15.162 --> 24:18.999
and she wanted Aunt Janet to pick up
puffalopes at the store.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.588
And that is the third story you've told
about that one stupid summer.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.757
I didn't live there after that.
That's what I remember most, I guess.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.552
I know those stories 'cause I was there
for those stories.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.971
I just want to hear some new stories.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.474
Serious, Theo.
You might want to slow down.

24:36.099 --> 24:38.977
I'm trying to drink her back to life.
Would you like me to stop?

24:39.060 --> 24:39.978
Yes.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.938
She got that from your mother.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.773
-You know.
-Alcoholism?

24:45.066 --> 24:46.568
No, "puffalope."

24:49.321 --> 24:50.322
She used to...

24:51.323 --> 24:53.492
She used to tell Nell that her letters...

24:54.159 --> 24:56.620
to Santa would be safe and warm
in the North Pole

24:56.703 --> 24:57.954
if she used a puffalope.

25:04.669 --> 25:05.504
Yeah.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.765
Nellie used to write letters to Santa.

25:19.059 --> 25:19.976
Took it...

25:20.727 --> 25:21.853
very seriously.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.313
Formal letters.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.525
Didn't want to call him...

25:27.400 --> 25:29.319
"Santa," so, she called him
Mr. Claus.

25:29.402 --> 25:33.198
She thought "Santa" would be rude.
That's not how you talk to grown-ups.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.409
So...

25:37.869 --> 25:39.454
"Dear Mr. Claus, this is...

25:41.164 --> 25:42.832
Nellie Crain." In whatever...

25:44.000 --> 25:45.293
address we were at.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.338
I told her she didn't need
to include that, but she...

25:48.755 --> 25:49.673
she insisted.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.051
You know, 'cause...

25:58.557 --> 26:00.141
She said, uh, you know...

26:00.684 --> 26:02.686
"Who knows how many Nells there are
in the world?"

26:02.769 --> 26:04.604
And we moved around so much.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.817
Yeah, we moved around so much...

26:09.818 --> 26:12.320
that, you know, he might get confused.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.781
"Dear Mr. Claus,
this is Nellie Crain in Boston.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.576
And...

26:18.118 --> 26:20.620
my brother, Steve...

26:22.455 --> 26:23.707
he wants a typewriter.

26:27.168 --> 26:30.088
And he's such a good brother,"
she would say.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.175
"And my sister Shirley,
she could use a new camera,

26:34.259 --> 26:38.179
'cause she's capturing our memories,
you know, and they're so very precious."

26:38.263 --> 26:39.639
And the thing is, guys, you know,

26:39.723 --> 26:42.017
she'd never ask
for anything for herself, ever.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.059
Not once.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.522
She'd only ask for presents for you guys.
And God...

26:48.857 --> 26:51.901
damn it, you know,
we had to make sure...

26:52.485 --> 26:54.321
we got you what--
what you wanted,

26:54.404 --> 26:56.948
what she-- what she mentioned
in those letters.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.827
'Cause we weren't about
to discourage that instinct.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.455
Your mom would say,
"Oh no, we water that seed...

27:04.456 --> 27:05.790
until that's her tree."

27:11.129 --> 27:12.005
Well...

27:12.213 --> 27:13.715
she used to write letters.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.510
And...

27:18.178 --> 27:19.804
always, you know, handwritten.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.765
She wrote me once a month.

27:25.685 --> 27:26.519
Always.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.272
Just telling me...

27:31.024 --> 27:33.151
the amazing things going on with you guys.

27:36.071 --> 27:36.905
Two of us.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.116
What do you mean?

27:40.367 --> 27:41.618
I mean, two of us.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.954
There were seven of us,
and now there's five,

27:45.038 --> 27:46.373
because two of us...

27:46.790 --> 27:47.957
decided...

27:48.291 --> 27:49.250
to die.

27:52.921 --> 27:56.383
You know some religions won't
let you be buried in their cemeteries

27:56.466 --> 27:57.592
if you kill yourself?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.386
It's-- It's monstrous.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.555
Like you committed a crime.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.893
When really it was just that you're
in so much pain.

28:09.813 --> 28:10.855
So much pain.

28:13.566 --> 28:14.859
And Nellie knew that.

28:16.736 --> 28:19.572
She knew the price the rest of us pay
when someone does that,

28:19.656 --> 28:20.907
and she did it anyway.

28:24.119 --> 28:24.953
God.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.623
I wish she felt like she could've
talked to me.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.293
I don't know why she didn't feel like
she could talk to me.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.004
There's nothing...

28:35.672 --> 28:38.174
she was going through
that wouldn't have been okay.

28:38.967 --> 28:39.968
Nothing.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.016
You know, uh...

28:48.977 --> 28:52.439
this one time,
Aunt Janet, she...

28:53.690 --> 28:56.985
She let us camp out
in the backyard, and...

28:59.946 --> 29:03.116
set up a tent, you know,
roasted marshmallows all night.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.201
-I remember that.
-Yeah, and...

29:07.120 --> 29:08.204
Steve...

29:08.830 --> 29:10.582
-Right, the bear thing.
-Yeah.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.625
Steve...

29:13.793 --> 29:15.795
he was outside pretending to be a bear,

29:16.254 --> 29:18.047
banging on the tent, and...

29:20.175 --> 29:22.802
you know, I'm freaking out,
and Nellie says...

29:25.263 --> 29:26.598
Nellie says, "Don't worry.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.933
We're safe in here. This...

29:30.810 --> 29:31.936
This tent is magic.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.397
It makes us indivisible."

29:38.735 --> 29:41.029
And Steve, Steve stopped shaking the tent.

29:41.654 --> 29:45.575
He says, hey... still in the bear voice,
"I think you mean...

29:46.701 --> 29:47.535
invisible."

29:49.204 --> 29:50.955
And Nellie shouts at the bear,

29:51.164 --> 29:52.707
"I meant what I said, bear."

29:58.087 --> 30:01.007
I'd like to go
back to something you said.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.134
What?

30:03.384 --> 30:05.011
Not you, him.

30:07.555 --> 30:08.765
You said Nellie...

30:09.933 --> 30:11.142
wrote you a letter...

30:11.684 --> 30:12.560
once a month?

30:13.353 --> 30:14.979
Yeah, that's right.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.568
So maybe she mentioned something
in one of her monthly letters that

30:21.277 --> 30:23.780
might have raised
the flag about, I don't know,

30:24.364 --> 30:25.448
her state of mind?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.325
No, she just...

30:28.368 --> 30:31.037
No, she would...
You know, she'd...

30:31.287 --> 30:33.748
talk about you guys,
and just like the Santa letter,

30:33.832 --> 30:36.501
-she'd just tell me about you guys.
-You said that, but...

30:36.709 --> 30:39.587
You see, we're all aware of how you like
to hold back information

30:39.671 --> 30:42.006
when a family member
offs themselves.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.633
-Steve...
-So I'm just wondering

30:43.716 --> 30:45.844
if there's a little more
you're not telling us.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.181
Do you want to do...

30:50.557 --> 30:51.516
do this now, huh?

30:53.810 --> 30:54.811
Yeah, I do.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.647
We've all got questions,

30:57.730 --> 31:01.192
and I think it'd be swell if you'd give us
a few answers for a change.

31:09.075 --> 31:09.993
All right.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.204
Let's start with that call you got
from Mrs. Dudley

31:13.288 --> 31:15.832
-and what exactly she said about--
-She called me...

31:17.458 --> 31:20.503
immediately after she called the police.

31:20.753 --> 31:23.464
She said she'd noticed the car out front.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.551
When she went inside
and she saw your sister...

31:28.887 --> 31:32.557
hanging next to
the spiral staircase in the library.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.641
Oh, and...

31:34.183 --> 31:36.853
Mrs. Dudley, she also apologized,

31:36.936 --> 31:39.397
because she said she threw up
on the floor, and...

31:40.398 --> 31:42.442
What's-- What's next?

31:43.109 --> 31:45.320
Did Nellie mention
in one of her puffalopes

31:45.403 --> 31:48.489
that she crashed a book signing of mine
about a month ago?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.116
-No, she did not.
-To scream at me.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.284
-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.369
-Does that sound like Nell to you?
-No, it doesn't.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.495
She wasn't herself.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.123
She was seeing a new therapist
since Arthur, I know that.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.542
-That's right.
-Anybody know anything about this doctor?

31:59.626 --> 32:02.545
Any psychiatrist worth their shit
would've kept her on a much shorter leash.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.923
-She's a fucking quack.
-She was clearly off her meds

32:05.006 --> 32:07.133
-when I saw her.
-How did she sound when she called you?

32:07.216 --> 32:09.135
-Wait, she called you?
-Yeah, the day it happened.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.262
-She called Steve, too.
-Did you talk to her?

32:11.346 --> 32:13.056
-No, I didn't get to.
-Me either.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.851
She wasn't worried about herself,
she was apparently worried about you.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.228
I talked to her.

32:22.023 --> 32:22.982
Yeah.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.318
I talked to her that night.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.112
And she was...

32:29.697 --> 32:32.992
She was worried about a lot more than,
uh, than Luke.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.287
Well...

32:36.371 --> 32:37.246
Like what?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.710
She said the Bent-Neck Lady was back.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.547
There it is.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.716
Mental illness.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.677
-No, no, Steve--
-Clear as day.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.261
-No, you don't--
-Hereditary.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.722
You let her believe all that bullshit.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.183
-You don't--
-All that bullshit about Hill House

32:57.266 --> 33:00.103
and this is the inevitable conclusion,
which makes you culpable.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.813
-Who is the Bent-Neck Lady?
-Frankly.

33:01.896 --> 33:03.940
So you hear her spout
some of the crazy stuff...

33:04.023 --> 33:05.858
-It's not crazy.
-...she said when she was six,

33:05.942 --> 33:08.277
and you don't think that maybe you should
get her some help?

33:08.361 --> 33:09.904
I did, I called you immediately.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.407
-Just like Mom, you ignore the signs...
-That's not how it is.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.451
...you hope it'll go away
and then you hold back information!

33:15.535 --> 33:18.663
If I held back anything,
it was to protect you kids.

33:18.746 --> 33:21.541
I don't need-- Why do I need protection
from the truth?

33:24.252 --> 33:27.005
She's... No. He's entitled...

33:27.255 --> 33:30.466
What... What is that

33:31.009 --> 33:32.301
I said you're entitled.

33:33.386 --> 33:36.222
-I'm entitled to the truth?
-You're entitled to your anger.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.348
Remember why we're here.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.476
It's very generous of you to allow me
to feel my anger.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.645
All of you... you're entitled.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.773
What else am I entitled to
while you're being so fucking generous?

33:45.857 --> 33:48.151
You might want to... check yourself...

33:48.776 --> 33:51.696
before you start talking about the truth,
Steve.

33:52.155 --> 33:55.074
Oh... great, are we breaking this out?

33:55.158 --> 33:57.243
-You're drunk.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.287
Theo's drunk, I'm just pissed.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.999
And this is the part of the show
where you break out my goddamn book?

34:03.082 --> 34:05.126
You want to talk about propagating
delusions?

34:05.209 --> 34:06.919
-Why don't we just...
-There it is.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.297
...paranoid delusions for entertainment
and profit, Steve.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.382
-...gonna make--
-What about that?

34:11.466 --> 34:15.511
You took all that paranoia and craziness
and you mass-marketed it

34:15.595 --> 34:18.347
-to jump-start your writing career.
-Really?

34:18.431 --> 34:20.808
So don't stand in plain view
of Nellie's casket

34:20.892 --> 34:24.187
-and lecture us about responsibility.
-Are you gonna stop the book fight?

34:24.270 --> 34:26.355
-We're all real tired--
-You were happy enough

34:26.439 --> 34:28.399
to exploit all of us for some blood money.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.860
That's why none of us ever took
your fucking money, Steve.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.945
-Cut it out.
-And you're fucking drunk!

34:33.029 --> 34:35.156
While we're supposed to be
honoring Nellie.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.242
Real class act, Theo.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.368
No, no, no.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.789
No, you don't know.
You don't know what I felt.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.583
And you don't know what I feel.

34:46.167 --> 34:49.128
And I am allowed to process that
any way that I want to.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.965
You don't just stand there and dictate
how we all grieve our dead si--

34:53.800 --> 34:54.967
-Fuck!
-Fuck!

34:55.301 --> 34:56.302
-Aw.
-You okay?

34:56.385 --> 34:58.262
I'm fine. God, don't touch me!

35:01.224 --> 35:02.809
Don't fucking touch.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.605
I have enough of my own grief. I...

35:08.481 --> 35:09.857
I don't need yours, too.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.944
Whatever that means.

35:20.785 --> 35:21.661
You know what?

35:21.828 --> 35:23.204
I took the money, Shirl.

35:24.872 --> 35:25.706
Yeah.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.501
I took his fucking money.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.586
I got my degree.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.171
I started my career.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.925
'Cause you know what?
It's good fucking money.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.510
The book was a hit.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.428
The royalties still haven't dried up.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.973
I'm fucking glad that I took it.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.311
You took his money.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.606
You'd have to be a real stubborn bitch
not to, so...

35:52.316 --> 35:53.818
Congratulations.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.237
Shut up.

35:56.946 --> 35:57.822
You're drunk.

35:58.156 --> 35:58.990
Nope.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.785
Yup... but, I'm right.

36:04.579 --> 36:06.622
So what now

36:06.706 --> 36:08.916
So you just thought
you'd live under my roof?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.835
-Shirl--
-No, let me get this right.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.546
Live under my roof, eat my food,

36:13.629 --> 36:16.465
and lie to my face
for how many years?

36:16.924 --> 36:18.759
Guess we should've charged you rent
after all.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.636
I offered to pay rent,
you sanctimonious bitch.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.556
I guess you won't have a problem
paying for a place of your own, will you?

36:23.639 --> 36:25.933
You can use all your royalties.

36:26.017 --> 36:26.976
Shirley.

36:27.059 --> 36:28.311
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I am.

36:28.394 --> 36:30.062
-No, she's not.
-We agreed. All of us.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.607
-We weren't going to participate--
-We didn't agree.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.151
-You stood up there and dictated--
-You don't get to lie to me,

36:35.234 --> 36:37.987
and live off me at the same time,
and call me a bitch.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.780
-All right.
-That's not gonna fly.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.407
-Slow up, Shirl.
-Fuck you!

36:41.532 --> 36:42.992
Fuck both of you!

36:43.409 --> 36:46.078
Blood money! Blood money!

36:46.370 --> 36:47.413
You're out, Theo.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.998
Are you gonna stop this

36:49.081 --> 36:51.417
After the funeral, you can
fuck off back to Cali, Steven.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.253
You can start looking for a new place
to squat, Dr. Crain.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.089
If I were you, I'd get off that high horse
before I fall off.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.717
If you were me, you wouldn't be
such a fucking asshole.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.053
You're just embarrassing yourself,
you don't even know it.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.640
She's falling on the goddamn ground
and I'm embarrassing myself?

37:05.723 --> 37:06.974
We took the money, too.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.190
I mean, I took the money, I guess.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.567
We did.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.113
No, you didn't.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.658
I opened an account for it.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.160
The checkbook that you found
the other day...

37:26.786 --> 37:30.331
Shirl, you keep cutting prices
down to cost.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.708
-Right? I mean--
-Don't you dare.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.962
The pro bono funerals,
the special cases.

37:36.045 --> 37:37.088
Don't put this on me.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.215
How else was I supposed to keep
the business going?

37:39.298 --> 37:41.801
I mean, look, if you think about it,

37:41.884 --> 37:44.595
we took that money and we changed it
into something that helped people

37:44.679 --> 37:46.722
-on the worst day of their lives.
-Stop.

37:49.684 --> 37:53.020
Do you have any idea how much
you've humiliated me?

37:53.104 --> 37:54.563
Look, honey...

37:55.690 --> 37:57.233
Don't.

37:58.985 --> 37:59.819
Both of you.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.321
Just... out. I can't...

38:02.655 --> 38:03.489
Shirley...

38:03.572 --> 38:05.950
I can't look at either one of you
right now.

38:07.076 --> 38:07.994
Get out.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.665
We're just--
We're done here. Everybody out.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.710
-Do I really have to move out?

38:16.877 --> 38:19.255
-Out!
-Just give her her space.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.881
Look, I need...

38:21.882 --> 38:23.342
I need some more vodka.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.513
-I want more vodka.
-There's more downstairs.

38:27.596 --> 38:30.057
-I need another bottle--
-Okay. We gotta go, let's go.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.183
Why don't we...

38:31.600 --> 38:35.771
go back to the hotel
and give your sister some space.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.190
You know, she's wounded,
we're all wounded.

38:38.482 --> 38:41.360
-People lash out. It's perfectly--
-What?

38:42.028 --> 38:43.696
What the hell?

38:44.155 --> 38:44.989
What?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.366
Who did this?

38:47.450 --> 38:48.576
What

38:48.659 --> 38:49.577
Shirl.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.579
What?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.165
Is this...

38:54.457 --> 38:56.125
What is this?

38:56.292 --> 38:57.418
It's...

38:57.752 --> 38:59.795
You think this is... this is cute?

39:01.047 --> 39:03.507
-I didn't...
-Someone thought, what?

39:03.591 --> 39:06.093
This was... funny? This was...

39:06.552 --> 39:07.678
Who the fuck did this?

39:07.762 --> 39:09.513
I swear to God, I didn't--

39:09.764 --> 39:12.099
-You were the last one up here.
-No, absolutely--

39:12.183 --> 39:14.560
-You were standing here.
-Why would I do something...

39:16.145 --> 39:18.439
What... the hell?

39:19.023 --> 39:21.901
-Did you blow a fuse?
-I've got a backup generator.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.652
The storm's not that bad.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.197
God damn tonight.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.615
Just damn it.

39:28.866 --> 39:31.035
Where... Where's your breaker box?

39:31.285 --> 39:32.411
Can I do anything?

39:42.171 --> 39:43.214
Daddy.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.425
Oh, Nell.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.203
Nell...

40:14.870 --> 40:15.996
Oh, no.

40:18.833 --> 40:19.792
Nell.

40:26.006 --> 40:26.882
Nell?

40:37.226 --> 40:38.477
She's not in our room.

40:39.186 --> 40:41.689
I don't know why she'd go anywhere else
by herself.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.732
Ah, the roof.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.025
I know.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.028
The hail, they sound like golf balls.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.656
I don't even wanna think
about what it did to this roof.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.201
I'll get Mullen over tomorrow to look.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.498
I just put batteries in.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.500
Okay, you get fresh ones,
I'll keep looking.

41:01.584 --> 41:02.585
All right.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.923
I'll check the library and the kitchen
just to be sure.

41:09.758 --> 41:11.302
-Be right back.
-Okay.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.306
Nellie?

41:18.976 --> 41:20.686
Oh, shit.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.240
Nellie?

41:35.242 --> 41:36.118
You in here?

41:44.877 --> 41:45.711
Come on.

41:47.588 --> 41:48.923
Where did you go?

41:53.636 --> 41:55.596
Really?

41:58.015 --> 41:58.849
Oh.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.061
Okay.

42:20.079 --> 42:20.913
Nellie?

43:03.539 --> 43:04.415
Liv?

43:22.558 --> 43:23.434
Liv!

43:34.069 --> 43:35.529
You kids okay down there?

43:36.405 --> 43:37.740
We're all right.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.292
Liv.

43:49.251 --> 43:50.085
Hey!

44:11.732 --> 44:12.566
Liv.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.276
How the hell did you...

44:23.952 --> 44:26.330
Liv, you better stay away
from these windows.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.332
This storm's getting really...

44:42.262 --> 44:43.138
Liv!

44:43.222 --> 44:44.807
Get away from the windo--

44:46.100 --> 44:47.267
Jesus Christ!

45:00.030 --> 45:00.864
Liv!

45:01.156 --> 45:01.990
Jesus!

45:02.866 --> 45:03.742
Liv.

45:04.284 --> 45:06.078
What the hell

45:06.954 --> 45:08.038
Are you okay?

45:08.997 --> 45:10.374
I think so.

45:10.457 --> 45:13.001
I looked in the rooms
but she wasn't up here.

45:13.544 --> 45:16.714
-What were you doing?
-I looked in the bed...

45:17.297 --> 45:18.382
bedrooms.

45:19.049 --> 45:19.967
Honey.

45:21.093 --> 45:24.388
-I'm having the strangest dream.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.896
Are you okay

45:33.939 --> 45:34.982
We're coming!

45:45.826 --> 45:46.660
What happened?

45:48.078 --> 45:51.039
There's something in the house
and my flashlight stopped working

45:51.123 --> 45:53.625
and I heard it breathing and I--
I don't know what it was,

45:53.709 --> 45:55.627
-but it was so close to us.
-Okay.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.379
Slow down, slow down.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.840
Even I saw it.
I think it was a big dog.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.925
It ran right there here
toward the kitchen.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.511
It was like this thing wolf
and had red these glowing eyes.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.556
I didn't see any glowing eyes,
but it was in here.

46:07.639 --> 46:09.516
-It was definitely something.
-Okay.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.351
Where did it go?

46:17.357 --> 46:18.317
It's okay.

46:27.326 --> 46:28.160
Again?

46:46.386 --> 46:47.346
Where'd you go?

46:48.889 --> 46:49.973
No.

46:50.474 --> 46:51.934
I just... nowhere.

46:54.269 --> 46:56.480
Oh, you're just wandering around
in the dark?

46:56.563 --> 46:57.648
Well, aren't we all?

47:00.567 --> 47:03.278
Steve and Shirl are still trying to get
the lights back on.

47:03.862 --> 47:05.572
Something tells me they won't.

47:06.281 --> 47:07.157
Yeah.

47:07.741 --> 47:09.326
Something tells me the same.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.756
Who do you think did this?

47:27.177 --> 47:28.637
Well, if I'm honest...

47:31.849 --> 47:32.724
none of us.

47:35.435 --> 47:36.395
But...

47:38.063 --> 47:38.897
you...

47:39.356 --> 47:41.316
probably know that already, don't you?

47:47.281 --> 47:48.240
So...

47:50.951 --> 47:52.995
The Bent-Neck Lady, you think she was...

47:53.537 --> 47:55.289
I mean, this whole time was...

47:56.540 --> 47:57.457
Yeah.

48:00.043 --> 48:01.628
She didn't do this to herself.

48:03.005 --> 48:03.839
No.

48:07.050 --> 48:08.427
Neither did Mom, did she?

48:11.346 --> 48:12.431
That's a...

48:13.599 --> 48:15.267
That's a complicated question.

48:18.478 --> 48:19.855
Doesn't make any sense.

48:20.147 --> 48:24.276
We have a backup genny in the basement
for the refrigeration.

48:24.359 --> 48:26.236
This is-- It's not even a storm.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.488
The rest of the block's fine.
It's just us.

48:28.572 --> 48:29.698
-For real?
-Yeah.

48:29.781 --> 48:32.784
-Why is it complicated?
-It's been a long night.

48:32.868 --> 48:35.787
-Why don't we... head back.
-All right.

48:35.871 --> 48:38.415
I'd really like to know, Dad.

48:39.291 --> 48:40.250
Know what?

48:42.419 --> 48:43.962
Nellie didn't kill herself.

48:44.212 --> 48:45.213
Oh, Luke.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.215
-Let's not do this again.
-She didn't.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.176
-And Dad knows it, too.
-Oh, does he?

48:49.259 --> 48:51.178
I don't think Mom did either.
Dad said that--

48:51.261 --> 48:52.304
"Dad said."

48:52.387 --> 48:55.349
-Luke, Dad propped up Nell's crazy ideas.
-No--

48:55.432 --> 48:57.601
-This is how that ended up.
-It's not crazy, Steve.

48:57.684 --> 49:00.646
As soon as we leave the room,
you start working on him, too?

49:00.729 --> 49:02.481
-No, Steve.
-No, let's hear it.

49:02.564 --> 49:05.901
No, I don't want to upset anyone
any more than we're already upset.

49:05.984 --> 49:08.570
-No, just get it all out.
-It's not--

49:11.073 --> 49:12.908
No, he's not gonna want to hear that
from me..

49:12.991 --> 49:14.618
You see what I'm talking about?

49:14.701 --> 49:17.287
I don't understand why this family
has such a hard time

49:17.371 --> 49:19.623
acknowledging mental illness.

49:20.207 --> 49:23.585
Mom, Nell,
Dad's talking to himself all night.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.711
It's not like that.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.464
Then explain yourself, finally, please.

49:28.548 --> 49:29.424
Okay.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.677
Nell didn't kill herself, the house did.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.054
You don't understand Hill House, Steve,
you never did.

49:34.554 --> 49:36.807
And Nell and Luke,

49:36.890 --> 49:38.725
they could see its face
clearer than you kids...

49:38.809 --> 49:40.519
-Jesus, Dad.
-...and your mother saw it, too.

49:40.602 --> 49:43.522
And anything I did,
I did it for a very good reason.

49:43.605 --> 49:46.108
-...all this bullshit about--
-You want to hear this or not?

49:46.191 --> 49:48.819
-...a haunted house and you don't get it.
-I don't get it?

49:48.902 --> 49:51.947
You don't get it. You're the ghost.
You are, Dad.

49:52.030 --> 49:54.574
-You're the spectral presence--
-Come on, Steve.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.035
-I can see right through you.
-Yeah?

49:57.119 --> 49:59.913
And the only difference between you
and the stuff of campfire stories

49:59.997 --> 50:01.289
is that you keep getting older.

50:01.373 --> 50:03.792
I just tried to keep your kids safe
and to protect

50:03.875 --> 50:06.712
what memories you kids still have
of your poor mother.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.006
-This is what got into her head!
-You've never understood.

50:09.089 --> 50:10.757
-This is what made her sick.
-Your problem--

50:10.841 --> 50:12.634
-It's always been your problem.
-My problem?

50:12.718 --> 50:14.469
You think you know
what happened that night?

50:14.553 --> 50:17.305
-You don't know--
-My problem is that the wrong parent died!

50:49.755 --> 50:50.672
Let's...

50:54.217 --> 50:56.219
-One, two...
-Let's go.

50:56.428 --> 50:57.304
Three.

50:58.805 --> 51:00.474
Okay, down.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.100
Set it down.

51:16.073 --> 51:16.907
I...

51:18.784 --> 51:20.285
I have to fix her makeup.

51:26.541 --> 51:28.251
I'll get my kit.

52:15.674 --> 52:17.008
It's all right, boys.

52:42.784 --> 52:43.660
Wait.

52:55.505 --> 52:56.464
Shirley.

52:56.882 --> 52:58.133
Shirley, wait.

52:59.593 --> 53:00.635
Nellie...

53:01.219 --> 53:03.513
There you are.
We were worried sick.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.270
Where did you go?

53:10.353 --> 53:12.230
I was... here.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.900
I was right here.

53:15.317 --> 53:17.402
Oh, honey, you're freezing.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.863
I was right here and I was
screaming and shouting

53:19.946 --> 53:21.448
and none of you could see me.

53:22.324 --> 53:24.242
Why couldn't you see me?

53:24.784 --> 53:27.412
-It's okay, baby.
-I waved and jumped and screamed,

53:27.495 --> 53:28.663
and you didn't even look.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.416
-None of you even looked.
-So sorry.

53:31.499 --> 53:32.667
We're so sorry.

53:37.631 --> 53:40.133
Come on, we'll see her tomorrow.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.058
Come on.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.657
Don't do that ever again.

54:04.032 --> 54:06.034
Don't do that ever again.

54:06.743 --> 54:07.577
Ever.

54:08.787 --> 54:13.208
I thought the house things had got you.
I thought they took you.

54:13.750 --> 54:16.294
-I'm so glad you're okay.

54:18.171 --> 54:19.130
Come on.

54:27.722 --> 54:31.059
I'll never let you go again.
Never again.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.519
I promise.

54:35.480 --> 54:37.023
I was right here.

54:37.357 --> 54:39.401
I didn't go anywhere.

54:40.026 --> 54:41.611
I was right here.

54:43.238 --> 54:44.823
I was right here...

54:45.156 --> 54:46.658
the whole time.

54:47.909 --> 54:49.411
None of you could see me.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.373
Nobody could see me.
