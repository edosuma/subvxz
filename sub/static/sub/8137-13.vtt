00:25.592 --> 00:26.684
That horse died.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.785
Hearing and believing
are two different things.

00:28.928 --> 00:29.917
We did it, bud.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.259
We made him disappear
into thin air.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.631
I had Lewis show you
the coming attractions...

00:35.702 --> 00:37.567
in case your horse scam
bottoms out.

00:37.637 --> 00:41.664
Something tells me that King
Jack is still alive and kicking.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.766
Losers don't last long
in my stable.

00:43.877 --> 00:44.866
You got a winner there.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.674
First, it was a horse. Now
there's a human life at stake.

00:47.747 --> 00:48.873
Now, where is she?

00:48.948 --> 00:50.540
Michael!

00:50.617 --> 00:51.811
Max, hang on!

00:51.885 --> 00:53.614
Help!

01:06.433 --> 01:09.163
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:09.235 --> 01:13.569
into the dangerous world
of a man who does not exist.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.374
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:23.450 --> 01:25.918
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:25.985 --> 01:28.249
the helpless, the powerless...

01:28.321 --> 01:31.313
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.305
Morning, Harley.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.937
You big speed demon.
You loved that, didn't you?

03:37.584 --> 03:40.246
You'd race the wind
if I let you.

03:40.820 --> 03:44.347
What? You say you want
to take me away from all this?

03:46.092 --> 03:47.150
How soon?

03:47.527 --> 03:50.621
Hey, Max, what are you
holding him back for?

03:50.697 --> 03:54.224
Holding him back? That had
to be 23.2 quarter mile.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.392
Try 24.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.599
Little lady...

03:58.137 --> 04:02.073
you've got to remember the futurity
tomorrow is a mile and a quarter.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.308
Now, we don't want our baby
fading in the stretch.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.009
Can you believe
this railbird?

04:08.114 --> 04:11.743
He's got half interest in the surprise
sensation of the racing season...

04:11.818 --> 04:14.480
and he's still treating
King Jack like an also-ran.

04:15.121 --> 04:18.317
Well, I don't know. From what I saw,
Max, his stride looked a little off.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.822
You see?
Always listen to your partner.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.761
Okay.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.599
But this time
you better watch out...

04:34.674 --> 04:36.869
because he's going
to blow your blinkers off.

05:28.628 --> 05:29.788
What happened?

05:29.896 --> 05:32.626
He took a fall, honey.
Lie still. You might be hurt.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.165
I'm fine.

05:34.567 --> 05:37.900
King Jack, where is he?
He's okay, isn't he?

05:38.004 --> 05:41.838
I'm afraid, he isn't, Max.
His foreleg is badly shattered.

05:45.912 --> 05:46.970
No!

05:47.046 --> 05:49.139
Harley, you can't! Isn't
there anything you can do?

05:49.215 --> 05:51.376
I'm sorry.
He's in tremendous pain.

05:51.484 --> 05:55.181
Don't do it! Please! I can
help him, I'll nurse him back!

05:55.254 --> 05:57.085
Don't do it! Please!
Max, Max.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.422
No!

06:01.227 --> 06:02.216
No!

06:03.196 --> 06:06.097
Please! No!

06:06.432 --> 06:07.421
No!

06:08.568 --> 06:11.002
Sleek, spirited
and moves like a hurricane.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.503
Michael, you're too kind.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.905
Not you, pal, the futurity
preview on Max's horse.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.540
What? A horse?

06:17.610 --> 06:20.340
Try stubborn, skittish,
and expensive to maintain.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.173
Not at all like you.

06:22.281 --> 06:26.183
Never, and capable of only 40
miles per hour in short bursts.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.982
Useless creatures.
What do people see in them?

06:29.055 --> 06:32.388
Dreams, buddy, dreams.
This is Max's big day.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.427
Max? You mean Maxine Fleming?
Right.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.690
Remember? Wolf Creek Pass...

06:37.764 --> 06:41.757
just winding up the Grimaldi case?
Six feet of snow, mid-January?

06:41.834 --> 06:45.065
How can I forget? You had me
hitched up to her horse trailer.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.169
I recall thinking,
"what next, a plow?"

06:48.541 --> 06:50.270
Well, that little pony
you were pulling...

06:50.343 --> 06:52.971
is now the hottest comer
on the thoroughbred circuit.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.004
Speaking of which...

06:55.348 --> 06:58.511
how about dipping into Bonnie's
little magic money machine...

06:58.584 --> 06:59.949
for me, will you, partner?

07:00.019 --> 07:02.351
Michael, it's called
an Auto Currency Dispenser...

07:02.422 --> 07:06.256
and there's nothing magic about it.
We have to account for every penny.

07:06.325 --> 07:09.783
I know. I know. I'm just a
little lean on cash this week.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.857
You wouldn't be thinking of
squandering Foundation funds...

07:12.932 --> 07:15.799
on something as chancy
as a wager. Who me?

07:15.868 --> 07:18.928
All right,
but $40 and not a penny more.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.498
$40. Besides...

07:23.910 --> 07:27.937
how can a horse named
King Jack lose? Michael!

07:45.498 --> 07:46.988
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

07:47.867 --> 07:51.735
That horse is making you so much
money, you're moving to a better place.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.406
Hi, Michael.
King Jack's biggest fan.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.308
Hello, sweetheart.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.215
You didn't hear?

08:06.719 --> 08:08.050
He's dead.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.755
What happened?

08:11.657 --> 08:14.217
He just collapsed, mid-stride.

08:16.362 --> 08:18.956
I tried to cushion his fall
but his leg...

08:20.700 --> 08:22.497
Broken?
Yeah.

08:24.403 --> 08:27.031
I still can hear
that rifle blast.

08:27.106 --> 08:30.769
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
I pushed him too hard.

08:31.477 --> 08:35.538
I must have missed all the signs. I
saw you ride King Jack once, remember?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.950
It was like you and that horse
had one heart and one mind.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.077
If he had a hangnail,
you'd feel it.

08:41.153 --> 08:45.146
Don't sugarcoat it, Michael.
It was my fault.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.421
And I'm through with horses.
I don't believe that.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.494
Michael,
I know you mean well...

08:50.596 --> 08:53.121
but I've got a bus ticket
to Atlanta tomorrow.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.463
You take me out and you
show me the spot. Michael...

08:55.535 --> 08:58.095
No. I mean it. I'm not gonna
let you run away from this.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.832
Come on, what's that saying? "When
you fall off a horse, you get..."

09:00.907 --> 09:02.204
"Right back on."

09:04.010 --> 09:05.841
But in this case I can't...

09:06.979 --> 09:08.207
'cause the horse...

09:09.949 --> 09:11.041
is dead.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.116
And I've got nothing
but bad memories out there.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.089
I know.
So let's go bury them.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.189
Now, I mean it. Come on.
Okay.

09:23.462 --> 09:24.588
Okay.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.803
This is the spot.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.605
Positive?
I was riding him.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.807
Maxine, who else
was out here?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.813
Just my partner, Tommy-Lee
Burgess and Dr. Thorpe.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.149
Dr. Thorpe. Who's he?
The local vet?

09:48.220 --> 09:51.121
Right. Just what are you trying
to prove out here, Michael?

09:51.290 --> 09:53.588
KITT, scan this area of
the track for me, will you?

09:53.659 --> 09:56.492
Normal carbon silicon
composite soil...

09:56.562 --> 09:57.995
soft to a depth of...

09:58.497 --> 10:01.193
Wait, there's some glass
over to your right.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.196
Whoa.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.110
This doesn't look like
it belongs out here.

10:12.178 --> 10:15.773
Knowing the grounds keeper, that's
just part of last night's beer bottle.

10:15.848 --> 10:20.182
No way, Maxine. It's much too
thin. KITT, run an analysis on this.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.382
Reconstruct what this
came from, will you?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.289
Taught him some new tricks,
huh, Michael?

10:28.461 --> 10:32.921
Taught me? Really, Max, that's
like the tail wagging the horse.

10:36.702 --> 10:37.999
A micro syringe?

10:38.170 --> 10:42.732
Yes. Residue shows that it recently held
promazine, a veterinary tranquilizer.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.833
Promazine?
Strong stuff?

10:44.910 --> 10:47.344
Like heroin for horses.
They use it for surgery.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.473
I don't know what it'd be doing
out here. How fresh is the residue?

10:50.549 --> 10:52.949
My calculated guess
would be 36 hours.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.383
Thirty-six hours.

10:57.423 --> 10:58.412
Maxine...

10:59.792 --> 11:01.726
how many other horses
train out here?

11:01.794 --> 11:04.058
None this week.
Just King Jack.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.262
Michael,
what are you thinking?

11:06.866 --> 11:09.960
Thinking about insurance...

11:10.036 --> 11:11.799
and about partners.

11:12.071 --> 11:15.165
Well, put a rein on it. Let
me tell you about Tommy-Lee.

11:15.441 --> 11:16.999
There'd been times
he had to choose...

11:17.076 --> 11:19.670
between burgers for himself,
and oats for the horse.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.305
And he chose the oats.
You're darn right he did.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.715
He's been a real good partner,
Michael, and a better friend.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.253
Well, then he won't mind me asking
him a few questions, will he?

11:28.320 --> 11:31.517
You'd do anything to avoid
helping me pack, wouldn't you?

11:31.590 --> 11:33.182
You got that right. Come on.

11:42.768 --> 11:45.999
That's my million-dollar baby,
King Jack.

11:46.105 --> 11:49.074
What are you doing, Harley?
He'll hurt himself on those ropes.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.939
Yeah, well, try feeding him without
them, he'll kick your skull in.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.444
I want this horse
out of here.

11:53.512 --> 11:57.209
Harley, relax. We did it, bud.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.782
We made him disappear
into thin air.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.116
I got my practice. Now, how long
do you want me to keep him here?

12:03.189 --> 12:08.149
A day, tops. By tomorrow, we'll be pulling
in enough long green to choke a horse.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.511
Have fun, pal.
I'll be right back.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.810
Michael, you're leaving me
alone in this lot of iniquity?

12:30.149 --> 12:32.845
Maybe you can show them
the error of their ways.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.783
December Bride's
got the form.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.458
The old Molly runs with class.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.865
But, Foster Folly owes me one,
the bum.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.663
There's no room
for emotion in betting.

12:56.208 --> 12:59.075
Taylor's Goose in the fourth.
Who's in there?

12:59.145 --> 13:02.945
Never mind who's in here. I've
given you a scientific projection.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.415
Kindly remove yourself
to the betting window...

13:05.484 --> 13:09.215
and spare me your superstitious
prattle. Hey, watch your language.

13:12.191 --> 13:16.184
You got inside information? Let's
just say, I have a hot system.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.408
Tommy-Lee Burgess. Excuse
me, my name is Michael Knight.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.044
I saw your picture on Max Fleming's
wall. I'm a friend of hers.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.813
Hey, any friend of Max's.
How's she doing?

13:44.924 --> 13:46.551
Taking this any better?
I wish.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.594
You know, I've never seen
her so down. Me neither.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.493
It seems she blames herself.

13:52.064 --> 13:54.692
Yeah, well,
I haven't told her this yet...

13:55.267 --> 13:58.236
but apparently, our insurance
company feels the same way.

13:58.437 --> 14:01.634
They're holding back payment on
suspicion of trainer negligence.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.536
Boy, when it goes, it
all goes. Maybe not.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.477
See, I know Max real well, and
I don't think she's to blame.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.945
I'd like to believe that.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.245
Yeah, well, you could
believe this. It's promazine.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.748
I found it on the track
where King Jack went down.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.820
Must be at least two dozen
horses train on that track.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.687
Is that a fact?
Yes, every day.

14:23.362 --> 14:27.560
But listen, if you think you're
onto something, you hang with it.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.763
Max and I could
use that insurance.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.735
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure you could.

14:31.804 --> 14:36.537
In fact, if you want, I'll call Doc
Thorpe. He might know something about this.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.703
No. Thanks for the offer, but
I'd rather talk to him myself.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.242
See you around.
Sure, I'll be here.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.531
Tommy, just in time.

15:06.605 --> 15:09.699
I need a nine letter word
for "hopelessly in debt".

15:12.011 --> 15:13.478
"Desperate" should fit.

15:14.346 --> 15:15.677
You'll get your money.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.139
I still got 48 hours.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.744
Well, if you value your life, you
better make sure I get the whole $92,000.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.845
I had Lewis show you
the coming attractions...

15:23.923 --> 15:25.891
in case your horse scam
bottoms out.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.449
Mr. Cavanaugh,
you don't understand.

15:28.894 --> 15:32.261
The money's as good as in
your hand. I pulled it off.

15:32.498 --> 15:36.025
You pulled it off only comes when I
cross your name out of my little book.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.466
Have you got that?

15:37.836 --> 15:41.670
Because from what Lewis says, you may
already have bloodhounds on your heels.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.672
But smile.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.409
I pride myself on protecting
my investments.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.682
If anybody gives you any
trouble, having Lewis around is...

15:50.749 --> 15:53.684
well, almost as good as
having a dog catcher around.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.145
Except Lewis puts
the bloodhounds to sleep.

16:10.602 --> 16:14.504
Okay, buddy, go for it. Give me everything
you got on King Jack's bloodlines.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.308
By Prince Jack
out of Whirlaway Dee.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.804
Tracing back further,
I find two derby champions...

16:21.914 --> 16:24.109
and a Horse of the Year
in his background.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.477
Further still in 1915...

16:27.553 --> 16:31.887
1915. Okay, okay, I get the
picture. Genuine racing royalty.

16:31.957 --> 16:35.449
You asked me to program him with
everything about horse racing, so I did.

16:35.527 --> 16:36.960
You may never hear
the end of this.

16:37.029 --> 16:40.430
Horse racing? What's all this
about? I have some maintenance to do.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.830
Thanks.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.426
Well, whatever it was, I'm glad
to see you're back, Michael.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.200
We have a pressing appointment
in Seattle. I need another day.

16:48.273 --> 16:52.209
Another day? You've just taken...
I see. Your friend, Maxine.

16:52.644 --> 16:56.774
I gather you had a good day at the
races? No. I didn't. I never made it.

16:57.116 --> 17:01.416
Devon, yesterday Maxine's horse
took a fall under her. She lost him.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.950
I'm so sorry.
She has my sympathy.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.518
However,
accidents will happen.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.323
Yeah, well, I don't think
this was an accident.

17:10.396 --> 17:14.025
That's why I need some time to
investigate. Investigate what, Michael?

17:14.098 --> 17:16.431
There are people who specialize
in dealing with these matters.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.935
I know that, but sometimes
a fresh eye helps.

17:19.003 --> 17:21.233
Besides, her partner's
not exactly Abe Lincoln...

17:21.306 --> 17:23.637
when it comes to telling the
truth. That may well be...

17:23.709 --> 17:26.940
but I believe it's your eye that's
dictating your decision here.

17:27.012 --> 17:30.243
She's a very pretty girl. Devon,
that's got nothing to do with it.

17:30.516 --> 17:34.543
Really? Then I presume you have
some concrete evidence to show me.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.452
That's what I thought.

17:37.523 --> 17:41.550
All right, I admit, I don't have that
much to go on, except for one thing.

17:41.627 --> 17:46.087
She's a very, very close friend of mine
who refuses to ride again because of this.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.726
Twenty-four hours. If I don't come up
with some concrete evidence by then...

17:49.802 --> 17:51.429
off to Seattle. Agreed?

17:53.205 --> 17:54.934
Agreed.
Right on.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.070
Not so fast.

17:58.677 --> 18:01.373
KITT's Auto Currency Dispenser
is $40 short.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.944
But I don't see any receipts.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.577
Bonnie, I'm on the road. I
can't keep track of every nickel.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.488
Is it possible the malfunction
is in me, Bonnie?

18:11.623 --> 18:14.683
No, and covering for him puts
a strain on your systems, KITT.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.325
Who, moi?

18:19.198 --> 18:20.187
Thanks, buddy.

18:25.904 --> 18:29.362
Where to, Michael?
First, we pick up Max.

18:34.446 --> 18:38.143
It's bad enough you're using my stable.
Now you want to use my horse trailer.

18:38.383 --> 18:42.717
You just ease off and think about
that retirement condo in Florida.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.087
What's that?

19:00.239 --> 19:02.207
It's Max and that guy Knight.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.533
Damn.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.343
I'll get the horse out of
here. You get rid of them.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.846
Me? How?
Just do it.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.815
Hello, Max. Dr. Thorpe,
this is my friend, Michael.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.079
Hello.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.085
He'd like to talk
to you about King Jack.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.255
What about him? I'd like to see
the report, if you don't mind.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.924
I don't know, son, that's not
how we do things around here.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.661
He's got my permission,
Doc.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.565
If you don't mind,
I'll just wait out here.

19:34.139 --> 19:36.664
All right, but I don't know
what you expect to find.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.258
You working with
the insurance company?

20:02.334 --> 20:04.564
No, sir,
just a friendly interest.

20:04.636 --> 20:08.572
I'm trying to figure out what caused the
accident, and give Max some peace of mind.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.805
Well, I'm afraid it's pretty
standard stuff, Mr. Knight.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.876
It's always sad, but in our business,
we lose thoroughbreds every day.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.142
Max doesn't.

20:17.783 --> 20:21.219
This is King Jack's fracture?
Yes, it is.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.545
As you can see, it's...

20:25.490 --> 20:27.185
a very bad fracture.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.162
Hey, boy, how you doing?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.007
It would take
some strong stuff...

20:44.076 --> 20:46.442
to dull the pain on something
like this, wouldn't it?

20:46.511 --> 20:48.376
Something like,
promazine?

20:49.114 --> 20:50.604
Yeah, guess it would.

20:51.817 --> 20:54.718
But, why would anyone dope a
horse they were gonna put down?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.351
It's a good question.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.325
Hate to hurry you, but
I've got rounds to make.

21:11.403 --> 21:15.339
Yeah, I can understand how
busy you are. One more thing.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.675
How did you happen to have your
rifle with you that morning?

21:18.744 --> 21:22.305
I always keep my .30-30 in my
pickup. This can be wild country.

21:22.648 --> 21:24.582
Thank you, sir.
Thanks for your help.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.842
Come on, girl! Out! Get, get.
Outside! Go on! Out!

22:07.626 --> 22:09.093
KITT,
where is the doc right now?

22:09.161 --> 22:12.358
He's putting
the file away, Michael.

22:12.631 --> 22:17.364
All right. Scan inside this barrel. I wanna
know when and what this gun last fired.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.267
Even as we speak, Michael.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.862
Michael!

22:20.939 --> 22:22.463
Help!

22:22.808 --> 22:24.776
It's the stable, KITT!
Let's go!

22:37.422 --> 22:38.411
Michael!

22:40.425 --> 22:42.017
Michael!

22:45.063 --> 22:46.052
Max!

22:47.332 --> 22:48.594
Max, hang on!

22:55.474 --> 22:57.965
I got you, Max.
Come on, baby.

23:00.011 --> 23:01.672
Okay.

23:06.518 --> 23:09.385
KITT, spray some CO2 on this.
Right away, Michael.

23:17.362 --> 23:18.522
You all right?

23:19.898 --> 23:22.992
Did the horse get out?
Yeah.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.329
And she'll probably name her next
colt after you for saving her.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.541
Think that fire was
just one more accident?

23:34.179 --> 23:36.044
There's no proof it wasn't.

23:36.782 --> 23:39.910
Whoever drove that trailer out
must have knocked the lantern over.

23:39.985 --> 23:41.714
How can anyone
be that careless?

23:41.820 --> 23:44.311
I don't think carelessness
had anything to do with it.

23:44.456 --> 23:46.754
Michael, I've completed
the analysis on that rifle.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.452
Fire away, pal.

23:49.127 --> 23:53.257
It was discharged yesterday, and I scan
traces of paper wadding in the barrel.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.560
Which means he might've
fired a blank.

23:56.802 --> 24:00.533
Oh, great. Now you're dragging Doc
Thorpe into your little conspiracy, too.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.630
Maxine,
Tommy-Lee lied to me.

24:02.707 --> 24:04.572
When I brought up the
promazine, he told me...

24:04.643 --> 24:07.840
there were dozens of horses training
on that track where King Jack died.

24:07.913 --> 24:11.110
He must have misunderstood you. You
know, he's got a lot on his mind.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.583
You wanna hear something else
that sticks in my gut?

24:14.085 --> 24:17.953
When KITT scanned the track,
he found no traces of blood.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.187
Now, you add that
to the rifle blank...

24:21.927 --> 24:26.762
and something tells me that King
Jack is still alive and kicking.

24:27.265 --> 24:29.290
Now you're being cruel,
Michael.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.096
No, I'm just calling it
like I see it.

24:31.169 --> 24:34.468
Look, if you want me to shut the door
and walk away from this, I'll do it.

24:41.079 --> 24:42.376
It's your call.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.974
Can you give me a little time
for all this to soak in?

24:46.351 --> 24:48.478
You got it. In the meantime,
why don't you whip up...

24:48.553 --> 24:51.579
one of those famous home
stretch javas you're so good at?

24:53.358 --> 24:55.792
Come on.
Okay.

24:58.697 --> 25:02.133
KITT, dig up everything
you got on Burgess, Tommy-Lee.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.029
Right away, Michael.

25:14.746 --> 25:17.442
Oh, no.
Hey, pal.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.245
Where've you been
keeping yourself?

25:21.453 --> 25:22.784
Come on.
I know you're in there.

25:22.854 --> 25:26.153
If you're funny-looking or something,
don't be shy. I got no prejudices.

25:26.224 --> 25:28.089
Please go away. I'm busy.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.819
You got company in there, huh?

25:30.896 --> 25:33.990
Come on, pal. Who do you like
in the seventh today, huh?

25:34.065 --> 25:36.192
If you must know,
I'm on the line.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.168
What do you got,
a wire to Hialeah?

25:38.236 --> 25:40.431
Come on, pal. Let me
in on the action. I mean...

25:40.505 --> 25:42.336
you and I could
go places together, you know?

25:42.407 --> 25:46.503
What will it take to make
you go away? Oh, very well.

25:53.852 --> 25:56.980
Baltimore Ned and Flying
Fenwick in the Daily Double.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.387
What? Are you kidding?
Flying Fenwick, at those odds?

25:59.457 --> 26:03.484
You asked for my opinion. Now, run along to
the betting window or you'll get shut out.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.621
Right, pal. Thanks.

26:05.797 --> 26:09.062
Listen. If I can ever lay one down
for you, you know, just say the word.

26:10.936 --> 26:13.268
What did you dig up
on Tommy-Lee Burgess?

26:13.338 --> 26:16.102
His bank balance fluctuates
like a roller coaster.

26:16.174 --> 26:20.270
And he makes an inordinate amount of
long-distance calls to a number in La Playa.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.412
Registered to one Randy
Cavanaugh, a known racketeer.

26:24.482 --> 26:25.779
No kidding.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.114
Interesting playmate
for a good old boy.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.680
Let's check this one out.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.036
Let's take a look inside.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.746
Some party.
Only for the winners.

27:04.823 --> 27:07.792
I'm scanning an illegal
gambling casino inside.

27:07.859 --> 27:11.886
Better and better. So this is
where Tommy-Lee's money goes.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.432
Slip me a couple of $100,
will you, partner?

27:17.502 --> 27:20.027
Partner? Whenever it's money,
it's "partner. "

27:20.105 --> 27:23.700
I always call you "partner." Now,
come on, it's Foundation business.

27:23.775 --> 27:27.302
Whatever you say, but don't
forget you still owe me $40.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.404
And I can't cover
with Bonnie forever.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.210
Thank you.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.853
That's okay, I'll park it myself. Right.

27:52.771 --> 27:55.467
May I see your invitation, sir? Yeah.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.441
Shoot. I forgot it.

27:59.911 --> 28:02.072
Shoot, I can't let you in.

28:03.081 --> 28:06.812
Did you lose this picture
of President Grant?

28:09.020 --> 28:10.044
No.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.153
I lost two pictures
of President Grant.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.658
Yeah. Well, yeah.
Here's the other one.

28:15.994 --> 28:17.757
No more betting.

28:18.863 --> 28:19.887
Seventeen!

28:19.964 --> 28:21.522
Okay, new bets.

28:23.334 --> 28:24.699
No more bets.

28:28.473 --> 28:31.533
Five red.
Five for $100, please.

28:35.013 --> 28:37.072
Here you go. Good luck.
Thank you.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.171
You're welcome.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.507
Place new bets.

28:43.855 --> 28:46.085
Number eight?
All bets closed.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.290
Nine red.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.058
That was close.

28:53.131 --> 28:56.066
"Close" only counts in horseshoes
and hand grenades, handsome.

28:57.001 --> 28:58.332
New bets.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.469
KITT?
Not another penny.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.734
The odds on that silly game
are 35-to-1.

29:06.811 --> 29:10.269
Not in here. Something tells me
that wheel's got a mind of its own.

29:11.616 --> 29:14.585
Okay, partner, let's make a
little spectacle of ourselves.

29:15.186 --> 29:18.986
Give me a winner.
If you insist, Michael, 23.

29:24.362 --> 29:28.196
I got a feeling about 23.
I'm gonna let it all ride, 23.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.391
No more bets.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.008
Twenty-three.

29:41.112 --> 29:45.014
Twenty-three, red winner.
Well, what do you know?

29:46.918 --> 29:49.250
Pink, the color of my bedroom.
This is great.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.982
Beautiful. Okay, there's
another $100 for you, sweetheart.

29:52.056 --> 29:53.080
Thank you, very much.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.126
Number nine.

29:55.193 --> 29:56.490
No more betting.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.098
Red nine.

30:06.938 --> 30:09.429
I haven't had this much fun
since I was six.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.106
Six.
All bets closed.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.246
Six black.
The gentleman wins again.

30:24.889 --> 30:26.789
Thank you.

30:27.926 --> 30:30.224
Quite a run, Mr...
Cooper.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.625
You the pit boss?

30:31.696 --> 30:35.154
Well, you could say that. Yes,
actually I own this place, Mr. Cooper.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.700
I'd like to buy you a drink.

30:36.768 --> 30:40.204
No, thanks. I'm on a roll. You see, I've
been superstitious since I was eight.

30:40.271 --> 30:41.465
Place your bets.

30:41.539 --> 30:42.938
How'd you happen
to find this place?

30:43.007 --> 30:46.272
You know, players tell players.
I've been a player since way back.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.407
Eight.
Eight, it is.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.812
Usually, I'm a horse man.
Horses aren't my game.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.889
Neither is roulette, today.
You're right.

30:58.957 --> 31:02.723
But if I want to find one special horse,
I heard you were the man to talk to.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.955
Really?
What horse would that be?

31:05.396 --> 31:07.921
You know, the one who had
that terrible accident.

31:08.666 --> 31:09.860
King Jack.

31:11.502 --> 31:14.335
Didn't you hear?
That horse died.

31:14.405 --> 31:17.169
Hearing and believing
are two different things.

31:17.242 --> 31:21.110
You see, me, I believe that King
Jack is still alive and kicking.

31:21.212 --> 31:25.205
And for the one who delivers him,
I'm prepared to go as high as...

31:25.617 --> 31:27.710
Thank you.
Seven figures.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.611
No questions asked.

31:31.089 --> 31:34.855
Well, I might know someone
that might know someone.

31:35.093 --> 31:39.962
Well, when you want to cut the bull and
talk business, you know where to find me.

31:41.866 --> 31:43.424
Have a good time.
Thank you.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.226
That's for you, sweetheart.
Thank you very much.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.472
Place your bets.

31:51.776 --> 31:55.007
I can't reach Tommy-Lee.
What's this change of plans?

31:55.613 --> 31:57.478
Well,
let me put it this way.

31:57.548 --> 31:59.982
We might have to call
our marker in a day early.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.451
But all he's got is that horse. I know.

32:03.021 --> 32:07.651
See that high roller over there? He
just made a very attractive offer.

32:07.725 --> 32:12.094
I want you to check him out.
High roller? Are you kidding?

32:12.664 --> 32:14.461
Why? What do you know
about him?

32:14.532 --> 32:16.591
Just that his name's
Michael Knight.

32:17.635 --> 32:20.536
And, he's the one that I
saw leaning on Tommy-Lee.

32:25.643 --> 32:27.110
His luck just ran out.

32:27.178 --> 32:30.705
Well, everybody, it's been a
real blast. Where do I cash out?

32:30.815 --> 32:32.976
Right through there,
Mr. Cooper.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.609
Thank you very much.

32:36.487 --> 32:37.476
Ciao.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.051
Hi.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.091
$50s and $100s
will be just fine.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.203
You're out of your league,
Knight.

32:54.238 --> 32:55.933
Take the limo.
Get rid of him.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.331
Easy.

33:47.058 --> 33:50.255
High-tempered, isn't he?
No. He's vicious.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.190
But that is something
I relish in stallions.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.723
I want him.
Well, I knew you would.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.462
You got a winner there.
For his sake, I hope so.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.166
Losers don't last long
in my stable.

34:04.075 --> 34:08.341
Bring him to Lincoln Hills Airport
tomorrow. You'll have your $1.5 million.

34:16.154 --> 34:20.454
KITT, can you read me?
Faintly, Michael. Where are you?

34:20.625 --> 34:22.592
Feels like
I'm in the trunk of a car.

34:22.693 --> 34:25.059
I guess this means
your plan isn't working out.

34:25.362 --> 34:28.422
Yeah.
Slight understatement, pal.

34:28.900 --> 34:33.268
All right, follow my signal and get
in as close as you can behind us.

34:33.337 --> 34:34.702
Silent mode.

34:41.779 --> 34:45.875
Hey! How about a tip? Cassie's
Gold in the fourth at Pimlico.

35:09.907 --> 35:14.469
KITT, how close are you?
It's getting stuffy in here.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.382
Any closer and I'll have
to marry this limo.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.586
I'll be your best man.
Will you pop the trunk?

35:46.544 --> 35:49.809
The cat's out of the bag. He made
us. How shall we deal with him?

35:49.881 --> 35:52.543
Let's teach him not to speed.
Brace yourself.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.891
All right, KITT,
call the police.

36:10.968 --> 36:13.903
While you're at it, steer
them over to Cavanaugh's club.

36:14.038 --> 36:17.166
Okay, man. Good buddy.

36:17.241 --> 36:20.005
It's time we had a man-to-man
talk about Tommy-Lee Burgess.

36:20.077 --> 36:22.068
How much is he
into you guys for?

36:22.146 --> 36:26.105
I want my lawyer.

36:40.932 --> 36:44.163
Afternoon, Tommy. What
are you doing way out here?

36:44.936 --> 36:49.339
I just came to get some fresh air.
You know how the air is in the club.

36:50.474 --> 36:54.069
Doc Thorpe told me where to
find you. A nice man, Doc Thorpe.

36:55.079 --> 36:59.072
Easy, boy, easy. He gets a
little nervous around strangers.

37:00.418 --> 37:01.578
Don't we all?

37:02.420 --> 37:06.982
The fact is, a stranger came to see
me. A man by the name of Michael Knight.

37:08.092 --> 37:11.619
He kind of let me know just how
valuable this horse really is.

37:12.263 --> 37:15.164
That's why I'm becoming
your new partner, Tommy-Lee.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.729
I don't need a new partner.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.837
I didn't ask you what you need.
I'm telling you what you got.

37:20.905 --> 37:24.341
Now, your credit's run out, and it's
time for me to collect my interest...

37:24.408 --> 37:28.071
which I figure is about 75% of
what you're getting for this horse.

37:28.145 --> 37:29.874
Seventy-five?

37:30.314 --> 37:33.147
You heard me. You better
be thankful, Tommy-Lee.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.010
I could take it all.

37:41.325 --> 37:42.314
Well...

37:43.628 --> 37:45.562
say hello to your new owner.

37:50.568 --> 37:53.662
Now look what you've done. Don't
just stand there. Go after him.

37:53.738 --> 37:56.639
There ain't no way I can catch
him on wheels in these hills.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.374
What are we gonna do?

37:58.609 --> 38:01.077
You may know about gambling,
Mr. Cavanaugh.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.375
But I know about horses.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.974
We'll get him back.
Don't you worry.

38:08.919 --> 38:10.386
I'm sorry, Michael.

38:10.454 --> 38:13.184
Cavanaugh's club was clean by
the time the police got there.

38:13.257 --> 38:15.418
Not a gaming table
or chip in sight.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.757
And even Cavanaugh himself
had disappeared.

38:17.828 --> 38:19.295
It doesn't surprise me.

38:19.363 --> 38:22.389
What about his man, Lewis?
True to his word.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.796
He let his lawyer talk for him. Really?

38:25.870 --> 38:28.703
Let me guess.
His bail was set for $10,000.

38:28.839 --> 38:31.364
Close, but no cigar.
$7,500.

38:31.475 --> 38:35.036
Yes, needless to say,
he made it. What now?

38:35.246 --> 38:38.113
Devon, I think Dr. Thorpe
is the weakest link.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.150
I'll pick up Max,
and pay him another visit.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.708
Right.
Be careful.

38:44.388 --> 38:47.289
Thanks, Bonnie. And take
care of yourself, too.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.785
You got me again, didn't you?
I'm gonna get you.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.809
King Jack.

39:52.256 --> 39:53.985
You're alive.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.319
King Jack.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.189
Oh, baby.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.099
Glad you're alive.

40:08.472 --> 40:11.373
What did I tell you?
They always head for home.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.533
You know your horses,
Tommy-Lee.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.207
King Jack.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.313
Now let's go get him.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.118
I'm glad you're back,
King Jack.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.126
Why, Tommy-Lee?

40:33.397 --> 40:36.833
After all we've been through
together, all our dreams.

40:37.301 --> 40:38.825
How could you do this to me?
To us?

40:38.903 --> 40:41.371
You should have let me sell
him when I had the chance, Max.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.772
Sell him? He's not a piece of real
estate. He's everything we ever worked for.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.036
I trusted you.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.273
You don't understand.
I was in debt, deep.

40:49.346 --> 40:51.678
Either the horse got it,
or I did.

40:51.982 --> 40:54.542
Get the horse loaded up now.
And bring her, too.

40:54.685 --> 40:58.553
Mr. Cavanaugh, I'll tie her up. By the
time anyone finds her, we'll be long gone.

40:58.656 --> 41:01.523
You may be planning on disappearing,
but I've got a business to run.

41:01.592 --> 41:04.823
And I don't leave any
loose ends. Bring her.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.725
Let's go. Bring the horse.
Come on. Move it.

41:18.909 --> 41:20.171
Michael, what do you think...

41:20.244 --> 41:21.711
they have planned
for King Jack?

41:21.779 --> 41:22.905
I don't know, KITT.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.073
But whatever it is,
it doesn't include Max.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.618
Max.

41:41.365 --> 41:42.354
Max.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.399
KITT, what can you tell me
about these hoof prints?

41:52.476 --> 41:56.572
Estimating size and weight, Michael,
those very well could be from King Jack.

41:56.814 --> 42:00.648
By the depth of the cut in the ground,
I'd say they're no more than an hour old.

42:05.556 --> 42:08.525
I bet these tracks belong to a
truck with a horse trailer rig.

42:08.859 --> 42:11.589
Yes, but I'm afraid those
aren't the only tread marks.

42:11.662 --> 42:14.324
There's a third set, and you
won't like what it matches.

42:14.398 --> 42:17.367
Cavanaugh's. 10-to-1.
You ought to be a handicapper.

42:18.335 --> 42:21.771
No future in it, partner.
Doc Thorpe, on the double!

42:23.574 --> 42:26.737
Seems like everybody in this territory's
in a hurry to pack up and leave.

42:26.810 --> 42:29.404
You've got no right to be here.
Don't talk to me about rights!

42:29.713 --> 42:32.705
Now, first, it was a horse. Now
there's a human life at stake.

42:32.783 --> 42:35.115
Where is she? I don't
know what you're talking...

42:35.185 --> 42:36.812
You know exactly
what I'm talking about, man!

42:36.887 --> 42:40.254
You made that horse fall, then you
faked its death. Now, where is she?

42:40.391 --> 42:42.086
I don't know.
Don't know?

42:42.159 --> 42:46.027
If they hurt Max, I'm telling you, man, I
will not be held responsible for my actions.

42:46.096 --> 42:49.327
Now, for the last time,
where are they?

42:49.667 --> 42:52.397
They're making the sale.
Where?

42:52.903 --> 42:56.430
Little airport. Two miles south of
here. They're jetting the horse out.

42:56.607 --> 42:59.474
All right, you can quit packing
and the police are right behind me.

43:04.949 --> 43:08.316
KITT, tap into the tower of the
airport. Check out the traffic.

43:08.385 --> 43:10.444
Anything big enough
to carry a horse.

43:10.521 --> 43:13.854
There's only one plane big enough,
Michael. It's a private jet belonging...

43:13.924 --> 43:17.416
to a wealthy horse dealer. All right,
buddy, we got to beat them there.

43:30.207 --> 43:33.904
I'm scanning a horse trailer and a
limousine less than a mile ahead, Michael.

43:33.978 --> 43:37.072
No kidding. Sounds like
our party. Affirmative.

43:37.214 --> 43:39.808
All right. We'll take
them one at a time.

43:57.101 --> 44:00.093
Hi. I thought you left
the driving to the others.

44:12.082 --> 44:14.846
How rude? He's trying to
make a sandwich out of us.

44:14.918 --> 44:17.546
I think I have just
the thing to loosen him up.

44:17.621 --> 44:20.351
Let's give them
a little fresh OJ.

44:20.424 --> 44:22.119
Arm your oil jets.

44:22.726 --> 44:26.127
Ready and waiting, Michael.
Just the thing for a slick guy.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.638
Good shot, buddy!

44:45.649 --> 44:49.380
One down, one to go.
Okay, let's make our move.

44:49.453 --> 44:50.715
Open the sun roof.

44:52.656 --> 44:57.423
Now, as soon as I get out, jump in
front of them, box him on the rail.

44:57.961 --> 44:59.053
Here I go.

45:00.230 --> 45:01.219
You got it.

45:13.777 --> 45:15.244
Damn! It's him.

45:19.583 --> 45:22.347
KITT, be careful.
Maxine's in here.

45:22.419 --> 45:24.683
She's safe as a baby
in her mother's arms.

45:32.029 --> 45:35.192
Watch it, KITT! Wait a
minute, I gotta pull on this...

45:47.945 --> 45:48.934
Go!

45:53.350 --> 45:54.578
Let go of me!

46:02.659 --> 46:07.255
You got enough for the run, but
not nearly enough for the stretch.

46:07.631 --> 46:11.431
KITT, have Devon notify the
authorities to pick them up.

46:11.502 --> 46:13.026
Michael. Look.

46:15.305 --> 46:17.273
Welcome back, King Jack.

46:21.011 --> 46:22.273
Welcome back.

46:38.829 --> 46:40.888
How's she doing, KITT?

46:40.964 --> 46:42.397
23.14.

46:42.466 --> 46:44.957
Fast enough to win
the Jackson Stakes tomorrow.

46:45.235 --> 46:46.702
Right on.

46:51.542 --> 46:53.407
Real Triple Crown winner, huh?

46:53.510 --> 46:55.842
I'm sure, even Man O' War
never looked better.

46:57.948 --> 47:01.384
You've got yourself a real
champion, Max. Thanks to Michael.

47:02.052 --> 47:05.715
Where would I be without you?
Saddle shy in Atlanta.

47:09.793 --> 47:13.957
So, I finally get to see you.
What did you do to me, pal?

47:14.932 --> 47:16.695
Do I know you?
Know me?

47:16.767 --> 47:18.962
You told me Foster's Folly
was a sure thing.

47:19.069 --> 47:21.299
He ran dead last.
I told you that?

47:21.371 --> 47:22.360
Yeah.

47:22.940 --> 47:25.067
KITT, is there something
I should know here?

47:25.142 --> 47:28.600
Don't look at me.
$20 I bet for you. Big deal.

47:29.012 --> 47:31.310
Me, I parlayed
my whole week's winnings.

47:31.481 --> 47:34.177
Now I'm gonna have
to start working for a living.

47:40.324 --> 47:41.313
KITT?

47:41.391 --> 47:43.586
Did you bet a horse?
With Foundation money?

47:43.660 --> 47:47.494
Michael, I was just trying to bail
out your Auto Currency Statement.

47:47.564 --> 47:49.464
Statistically,
I couldn't lose.

47:49.533 --> 47:52.900
That's what they all say.
Michael, can I ask you a favor?

47:55.706 --> 47:59.267
Yeah, partner, what is it?
Lend me $20.

48:02.145 --> 48:03.407
No.
