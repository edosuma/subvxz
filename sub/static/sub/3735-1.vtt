00:23.088 --> 00:26.946
Do I have an original thought
in my head? My bald head?

00:27.050 --> 00:29.970
Maybe if I were happier,
my hair wouldn't be falling out.

00:30.074 --> 00:33.671
Life is short. I need
to make the most of it.

00:33.706 --> 00:37.269
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

00:38.103 --> 00:39.667
I'm a walking cliche.

00:39.772 --> 00:42.483
I really need to go to the doctor
and have my leg check ed.

00:42.587 --> 00:44.255
There's something wrong.
A bump.

00:44.464 --> 00:46.827
The dentist called again.
I'm way overdue.

00:46.862 --> 00:49.261
If I stopped putting things off,
I'd be happier.

00:50.825 --> 00:54.109
All I do is sit on my fat ass.
If my ass wasn't fat, I'd be happier.

00:54.144 --> 00:57.394
I wouldn't have to wear these shirts
with the tails out all the time.

00:57.429 --> 00:59.062
Like that's fooling anyone.

00:59.271 --> 01:03.129
Fat ass. I should start jogging again.
Five miles a day.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.257
Really do it this time.
Maybe rock climbing.

01:06.361 --> 01:08.099
I need to turn my life around.

01:08.134 --> 01:10.949
What do I need to do?
I need to fall in love.

01:10.984 --> 01:12.513
I need to have a girlfriend.

01:12.618 --> 01:14.912
I need to read more,
improve myself.

01:15.016 --> 01:16.858
What if I learned Russian
or something?

01:16.893 --> 01:20.021
Or took up an instrument?
I could speak Chinese.

01:20.125 --> 01:23.671
I would be the screenwriter who
speaks Chinese. And plays the oboe.

01:23.706 --> 01:26.486
That would be cool.
I should get my hair cut short.

01:26.590 --> 01:29.823
Stop trying to fool everyone
into thinking I have a full head of hair.

01:29.858 --> 01:33.055
How pathetic is that?
Just be real. Confident.

01:33.090 --> 01:35.349
Isn't that what women
are attracted to?

01:35.453 --> 01:37.087
Men don't have to be attractive.

01:37.122 --> 01:39.694
But that's not true,
especially these days.

01:39.729 --> 01:42.961
Almost as much pressure on men
as there is on women these days.

01:43.065 --> 01:46.194
Why should I be made to feel I have
to apologize for my existence?

01:46.229 --> 01:47.966
Maybe it's my brain chemistry.

01:48.070 --> 01:50.434
Maybe that's what's wrong with me.:
Bad chemistry.

01:50.469 --> 01:53.597
All my problems and anxiety can be
reduced to a chemical imbalance...

01:53.701 --> 01:55.682
or some kind of
misfiring synapses.

01:55.787 --> 01:57.664
I need to get help for that.

01:57.768 --> 01:59.958
But I'll still be ugly, though.

02:00.166 --> 02:01.834
Nothing's gonna change that.

02:01.939 --> 02:02.981
Shut up!

02:05.588 --> 02:09.238
Let's really try today
to solve our camera problems.

02:10.489 --> 02:12.783
Keep between-take time
at an absolute minimum.

02:12.887 --> 02:15.146
These masks are really hot. Okay?

02:15.181 --> 02:17.962
I wanna be very well-heard
on that from everybody.

02:17.997 --> 02:22.220
Don't futz unless it's absolutely
important to the shot, okay?

02:22.255 --> 02:26.443
I don't say that for me.
I say that for the people sitting here...

02:26.547 --> 02:28.216
- Thank you, John.
- In the rubber.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.927
- I like my dress. Okay?
- Very good.

02:31.761 --> 02:34.576
So now, folks, you better
heed that advice.

02:36.662 --> 02:37.913
Stand by for picture.

02:39.268 --> 02:42.292
Have her rotate around the table
a little bit further.

02:45.316 --> 02:46.568
Hold on until we're clear.

02:46.672 --> 02:49.800
You. You're in the eyeline.
Can you please get off the stage?

02:49.835 --> 02:52.198
Yeah, just bring in the six-footer.

02:57.099 --> 03:00.123
What am I doing here?
Why did I bother to come here today?

03:00.436 --> 03:02.313
Nobody even seems to know
my name.

03:02.417 --> 03:07.631
I've been on this planet for 40 years,
and I don't understand a single thing.

03:07.666 --> 03:10.655
Why am I here?
How did I get here?

04:07.171 --> 04:09.847
My leg hurts. I wonder if it's cancer.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.488
There's a bump. I'm starting to sweat.
Stop sweating.

04:12.593 --> 04:14.782
I've got to stop sweating.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.702
Can she see it dripping
down my forehead?

04:17.805 --> 04:20.622
She looked at my hairline.
She thinks I'm bald. She...

04:20.656 --> 04:23.229
We think you're great.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.105
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

04:25.210 --> 04:27.921
We all just loved the Malkovich script.

04:27.956 --> 04:30.597
- Thanks. Thanks...
- Such a unique voice.

04:30.632 --> 04:33.447
Boy, I'd love to find
a portal into your brain.

04:33.552 --> 04:35.429
Trust me, it's no fun.

04:37.514 --> 04:40.642
So tell me your thoughts
on this crazy little project of ours.

04:42.623 --> 04:44.396
First, I think it's a great book.

04:45.752 --> 04:48.046
- Laroche is a fun character, isn't he?
- Absolutely.

04:48.150 --> 04:51.452
And Orlean makes orchids
so fascinating.

04:51.487 --> 04:55.205
Plus, her musings on Florida
and orchid poaching...

04:55.240 --> 04:58.681
Indians. It's just-it's great,
sprawling New Yorker stuff.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.350
I'd want to remain true to that.

05:00.454 --> 05:04.625
I'd wanna let the movie exist,
rather than be...

05:04.660 --> 05:08.170
- Artificially plot-driven.
- Great.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.090
I guess I'm not exactly sure
what that means.

05:13.905 --> 05:16.790
I'm not sure I know
what that means either.

05:16.825 --> 05:19.953
I just don't wanna ruin it by making
it a Hollywood thing. You know?

05:20.057 --> 05:24.958
Like... an orchid heist movie
or something, you know?

05:24.993 --> 05:27.530
Or changing the orchids
into poppies...

05:27.565 --> 05:29.650
and making it about drug running,
you know?

05:29.859 --> 05:31.736
- Definitely.
- Why can't there be a movie...

05:31.840 --> 05:33.821
simply about flowers?

05:34.343 --> 05:36.324
I guess we thought that maybe...

05:36.428 --> 05:39.834
Susan Orlean and Laroche
could fall in love, and...

05:39.869 --> 05:43.832
Okay. But I'm saying, it's like,
I don't wanna cram in sex...

05:43.867 --> 05:46.925
or guns or car chases...

05:46.960 --> 05:50.818
you know,
or characters, you know...

05:50.922 --> 05:53.494
learning profound life lessons.

05:53.529 --> 05:55.614
Or growing,
or coming to like each other...

05:55.719 --> 05:59.160
or overcoming obstacles to succeed
in the end, you know? I mean...

05:59.195 --> 06:01.766
The book isn't like that...

06:01.871 --> 06:05.833
and life isn't like that.
You know, it just isn't. And...

06:08.440 --> 06:11.255
I feel very strongly about this.

06:13.445 --> 06:16.469
John Laroche is a tall guy,
skinny as a stick...

06:16.504 --> 06:19.354
pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered...

06:19.389 --> 06:23.716
sharply handsome, despite the fact
he's missing all his front teeth.

06:23.751 --> 06:28.008
I went to Florida two years ago
to write a piece for The New Yorker.

06:28.043 --> 06:32.318
It was after reading a small article about
a white man and three Seminole men...

06:32.353 --> 06:35.134
arrested with rare orchids
they'd stolen out of a place...

06:35.238 --> 06:38.679
called the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

06:41.599 --> 06:46.395
As natural selection works solely by
and for the good of each being...

06:47.959 --> 06:52.860
all corporeal and mental endowments
will tend to progress towards perfection.

06:52.895 --> 06:57.031
It's interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank...

07:14.862 --> 07:17.052
Polyrrhiza lindenii.

07:18.511 --> 07:20.180
A ghost.

07:23.308 --> 07:25.602
Cut her down, Russell.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.648
- Morning.
- Hey.

08:10.856 --> 08:13.776
May I ask you gentlemen what you
have in those pillowcases?

08:13.880 --> 08:16.487
Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.928
- Okay, then, I'm asking.
- Well, okay, then.

08:19.963 --> 08:21.492
Let's see.

08:21.805 --> 08:25.628
We've got five kinds of bromeliad...

08:25.663 --> 08:29.313
one peperomia,
nine orchid varieties.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.422
You know,
about 130 plants all told.

08:34.525 --> 08:36.924
Which my colleagues here
removed from the swamp.

08:37.029 --> 08:41.721
You're aware it's illegal to remove plants
or animals from state-owned land?

08:41.756 --> 08:43.702
Yeah, and don't forget...

08:43.807 --> 08:47.352
these plants are all endangered, sir.
Every one of them.

08:47.456 --> 08:51.627
Well, exactly. That's exactly the issue.
This is a state preserve.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.817
Yes, sir. It is.

08:54.442 --> 08:57.101
- But-
- My colleagues are all Seminole indians.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.760
Did I mention that?
You're familiar, I'm sure...

08:59.865 --> 09:02.367
with the State of Florida
versus James E. Billie?

09:02.784 --> 09:07.789
So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther...

09:07.824 --> 09:09.979
one of what, 40 in the entire world?

09:10.083 --> 09:11.439
- Forty.
- Forty.

09:11.648 --> 09:14.115
The state couldn't successfully
prosecute him...

09:14.150 --> 09:17.139
because, you know, he's an indian,
and it's his right.

09:17.174 --> 09:22.492
As repugnant as you and I, as white
conservationists, might find his actions.

09:22.527 --> 09:25.307
- But-
- Not to mention the failed attempts...

09:25.412 --> 09:29.860
on three occasions to prosecute
Seminoles for poaching palm fronds.

09:29.895 --> 09:35.422
Which I believe they use to thatch the
roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

09:35.839 --> 09:38.341
How about that?
With the chickee huts, right?

09:38.446 --> 09:42.617
Yeah, he's right. That's exactly what
we use them for. Chickee huts.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.081
Yeah, but I don't...

09:49.186 --> 09:52.627
I can't let you fellas leave yet.

09:53.357 --> 09:57.006
- Just hold on there a minute.
- Okay.

09:58.675 --> 10:01.177
Charles, is that you?

10:03.054 --> 10:05.035
Did you eat lunch?

10:05.452 --> 10:09.519
I had that shrimp cocktail in the fridge.
Was it yours?

10:09.554 --> 10:12.925
I hope not. I couldn't remember,
so I ate it.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.192
Maybe we should write our names
on our food items from now on.

10:16.297 --> 10:18.973
- What's with you?
- My back.

10:19.008 --> 10:23.596
Charles, you'll be glad. I have a plan
to get me out of your house, pronto.

10:23.631 --> 10:28.601
- A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?
- Drum roll, please.

10:29.852 --> 10:33.050
I'm gonna be a screenwriter.
Like you.

10:33.085 --> 10:36.109
I know you think this is just
one of my "get rich quick" schemes...

10:36.213 --> 10:37.881
but I'm doing it right this time.

10:37.986 --> 10:41.844
I'm taking a three-day seminar,
and it's only 500 bucks.

10:41.948 --> 10:44.520
Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

10:44.555 --> 10:47.683
In theory, I agree with you.
But this one's different.

10:47.787 --> 10:49.768
This one's highly regarded
in the industry.

10:49.873 --> 10:52.271
Donald, don't say "industry."

10:52.306 --> 10:54.356
I'm sorry. I forgot.

10:54.461 --> 10:57.067
Charles, this guy knows screenwriting.

10:57.172 --> 10:59.674
People come from all over
to study with him.

10:59.779 --> 11:02.490
- I'll pay you back as soon as I-
- Let me explain something.

11:02.594 --> 11:06.452
Anybody who says he's got "the answer"
is going to attract desperate people...

11:06.487 --> 11:08.016
be it in the world of religion...

11:08.225 --> 11:10.727
I just need to lie down
while you explain this to me.

11:10.762 --> 11:13.021
Sorry. I apologize.

11:13.751 --> 11:15.628
Okay, go ahead.

11:15.732 --> 11:17.713
- So-
- Sorry. Okay. Go.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.660
There are no rules, Donald.

11:19.695 --> 11:22.301
And anybody who says there are
is just, you know...

11:22.406 --> 11:25.638
Not rules. Principles.

11:26.055 --> 11:30.018
McKee writes that a rule says,
"You must do it this way."

11:30.122 --> 11:34.919
A principle says, "This works
and has through all remembered time."

11:34.954 --> 11:38.047
The script I'm starting,
it's about flowers.

11:38.777 --> 11:41.175
Nobody's ever done a movie
about flowers before.

11:41.279 --> 11:45.242
- So there are no guidelines.
- What about Flowers for Algernon?

11:45.346 --> 11:48.161
Well, that's not about flowers.
And it's not a movie.

11:48.196 --> 11:50.142
I'm sorry. I never saw it.

11:50.247 --> 11:51.776
How-? Okay, keep going.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.522
Look, my point is
that those teachers are dangerous...

11:54.626 --> 11:56.677
if your goal is to try
to do something new.

11:56.712 --> 12:00.674
A writer should always have that goal.
Writing is a journey into the unknown.

12:00.709 --> 12:04.115
It's not building, you know,
one of your model airplanes.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.101
McKee is a former Fulbright Scholar,
Charles.

12:11.206 --> 12:14.438
Are you a former Fulbright Scholar?

12:17.462 --> 12:20.799
Say something. I dragged her here,
and now I'm not saying anything.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.780
Make her laugh.
Say something funny.

12:23.927 --> 12:26.603
I hate parties, Amelia.
Why did we come here?

12:26.638 --> 12:29.558
Because we're hip, young trendsetters
on the make, aren't we?

12:29.593 --> 12:32.373
More like old losers
sitting on the floor, maybe.

12:32.408 --> 12:37.482
Jesus, Charlie. Speak for yourself.
Okay...

12:38.421 --> 12:40.610
Charlie, we're gonna fix you up.

12:40.715 --> 12:45.303
We're gonna solve the whole Charlie
Kaufman mess for once and for all.

12:45.338 --> 12:47.040
- Okay.
- Okay, let me see.

12:47.075 --> 12:50.621
What do you need?
What, what, what?

12:51.246 --> 12:53.749
Well, I'm glad you took
the orchid script.

12:53.853 --> 12:57.190
I think it will be good for you
to get out of your head.

12:57.294 --> 13:01.778
I think it'll ground you to think about the
bigger picture, about nature and stuff.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.802
I still can't believe they gave me
that job.

13:04.906 --> 13:08.973
I mean, after that lunch.
I was sweating insanely.

13:09.008 --> 13:11.892
I was ranting. I was a mess.

13:11.997 --> 13:14.082
You were just nervous
because she was pretty.

13:14.186 --> 13:15.959
How do you know she was pretty?

13:16.063 --> 13:20.130
After eight months of knowing you,
I think I get what makes you sweat.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.953
Well, whatever.
Well, moving on, what next?

13:23.988 --> 13:27.742
You need a new getup.
This whole flannel shirt thing...

13:27.777 --> 13:31.496
it's not really doing anything
for you anymore.

13:34.311 --> 13:37.335
Thanks for coming out
with me tonight, Amelia.

13:53.184 --> 13:56.625
To begin.

13:57.147 --> 13:59.024
How to start?

14:00.692 --> 14:02.117
I'm hungry.

14:02.152 --> 14:03.716
I should get coffee.

14:03.925 --> 14:05.801
Coffee would help me think.

14:05.906 --> 14:09.660
But I should write something first,
then reward myself with coffee.

14:09.695 --> 14:15.499
Coffee and a muffin. Okay,
so I need to establish the themes.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.731
Maybe banana-nut.

14:18.940 --> 14:21.130
That's a good muffin.

14:24.675 --> 14:26.760
Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.244
Victorian-era orchid hunter
William Arnold...

14:31.348 --> 14:34.164
drowned on a collecting expedition.

14:35.415 --> 14:38.335
Osmers vanished without a trace
in Asia.

14:40.941 --> 14:47.198
Augustus Margary survived toothache,
rheumatism, pleurisy and dysentery...

14:48.449 --> 14:51.577
only to be murdered when
he completed his mission...

14:51.682 --> 14:54.705
and traveled beyond Bhamo.

14:57.834 --> 15:00.510
Laroche loved orchids, but I...

15:00.545 --> 15:04.507
I came to believe he loved the
difficulty and fatality of getting them...

15:04.611 --> 15:08.365
almost as much as he loved
the orchids themselves.

15:09.304 --> 15:12.223
I've been a professional horticulturist
for, like, 12 years.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.333
I owned my own plant nursery,
which was destroyed by the hurricane.

15:17.437 --> 15:19.522
I'm a professional plant lecturer.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.068
I've given over, like, 60 lectures
on the cultivation of plants.

15:23.103 --> 15:27.030
I'm a published author,
both in magazine and book form.

15:27.065 --> 15:29.533
And I have extensive experience
with orchids...

15:29.637 --> 15:35.268
and the asexual micropropagation
of orchids under aseptic cultures.

15:35.303 --> 15:40.168
That's laboratory work.
It's not at all like your nursery work.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.505
I'm probably the smartest person
I know.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.321
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

15:51.013 --> 15:53.515
Mr. Laroche? I'm Susan Orlean.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.227
I'm a writer for The New Yorker.
It's a magazine that...

15:56.331 --> 15:58.416
I'm familiar with The New Yorker.

15:58.521 --> 16:01.857
"The New Yorker?
Yes, The New Yorker." Right?

16:01.892 --> 16:03.526
That's right.

16:03.734 --> 16:07.488
I'm very interested in doing a piece
on your situation here, and...

16:07.801 --> 16:09.261
Yeah? Yeah.

16:09.365 --> 16:11.346
You wanna put this in?

16:11.450 --> 16:13.536
I don't care what goes on here.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.768
I'm right, and I'll take it all the way
to Supreme Court.

16:16.803 --> 16:20.105
Because that judge can screw herself.

16:26.466 --> 16:30.324
- That for real would go in?
- Absolutely.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.446
We open on State Road 29.

16:41.481 --> 16:45.026
A battered white van speeds along,
making a sharp, skidding right...

16:45.061 --> 16:47.807
into the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

16:47.842 --> 16:51.700
The driver of the van is a skinny man
with no front teeth.

16:52.013 --> 16:55.141
This is John Laroche.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.269
I need a break.

16:59.312 --> 17:03.430
- I loved the Sibelius violin concerto.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

17:03.465 --> 17:07.549
- The end was a little weird, but-
- Oh, no! God, it was passionate.

17:07.584 --> 17:09.113
It was exultant.

17:09.218 --> 17:14.013
The soloist was amazing.
Such beautiful tones. So precise.

17:14.049 --> 17:15.682
God, it blows my mind.

17:15.787 --> 17:18.810
- I wish I could play like that.
- You do.

17:19.645 --> 17:22.982
Charlie. I don't.
I'm mediocre at best.

17:23.017 --> 17:25.380
Well, I love listening to you play.

17:25.483 --> 17:27.153
Thanks, Charlie.

17:29.864 --> 17:31.741
Here we are.

17:35.703 --> 17:38.588
What are you up to now, then?

17:38.623 --> 17:43.732
I should probably get to bed.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

17:43.767 --> 17:46.234
Well, good night, then.

17:54.576 --> 17:56.036
I would stay out.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.338
It's just that I've really been struggling
on the script right now.

17:59.373 --> 18:03.022
I've been thinking about it too small,
just writing it like a story about Laroche.

18:03.127 --> 18:06.324
That's not enough. I mean,
I wanted to write about flowers.

18:06.359 --> 18:10.634
Anyway, I can't figure it out, and I
haven't been sleeping very well lately...

18:10.669 --> 18:12.407
so I thought I should get home...

18:12.511 --> 18:16.786
and try to get a good night's sleep,
you know. Start fresh in the morning.

18:16.821 --> 18:18.872
Otherwise, I'd stay out.

18:18.976 --> 18:23.251
I understand. I hope you figure it out,
Charlie. I really do.

18:23.286 --> 18:26.380
Thanks. Thanks for coming out
with me and everything.

18:26.484 --> 18:28.361
Sure, it was fun.

18:28.465 --> 18:33.262
So I have to go to Santa Barbara next
weekend for this orchid show up there.

18:33.297 --> 18:36.181
I thought maybe you could come.

18:36.703 --> 18:38.267
No, I...

18:39.101 --> 18:42.020
I don't think I can make it
next weekend.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.419
I don't think I can.

18:44.523 --> 18:47.130
I've got something. Sorry.

18:47.234 --> 18:48.867
Okay.

18:48.902 --> 18:52.031
So, well, okay, then.
So good night, then.

18:52.135 --> 18:54.325
Good night, Charlie.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.078
Why didn't I go in?
I'm such a chick en.

18:58.183 --> 19:01.102
I'm such an idiot. I should have
kissed her. I've blown it.

19:01.207 --> 19:04.022
I should just go and knock
on her door right now and kiss her.

19:04.126 --> 19:08.714
It would be romantic. Something
we could someday tell our kids.

19:09.131 --> 19:11.634
I'm gonna do that right now.

19:26.336 --> 19:29.777
- Thanks for picking me up.
- This van's a piece of shit.

19:29.882 --> 19:33.114
But when I hit the jackpot,
I'll buy myself an awesome car.

19:33.218 --> 19:35.460
Hey, what are you driving?

19:35.495 --> 19:37.702
It's-Well, it's a rental.

19:37.806 --> 19:40.900
- It's a Lumina.
- Awesome.

19:40.935 --> 19:43.854
I think I'll get one of those too.

19:48.964 --> 19:50.424
Here we go.

19:52.926 --> 19:55.950
Where do these people learn
to drive?

19:56.159 --> 19:57.827
The world's insane.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.503
So I was impressed to hear...

20:00.538 --> 20:03.249
how accomplished you are
in the world of horticulture.

20:03.353 --> 20:05.300
The thing you gotta know is...

20:05.335 --> 20:08.463
my whole life is looking for
a goddamn profitable plant, see?

20:08.567 --> 20:09.923
And that's the ghost.

20:10.027 --> 20:11.174
Why the ghost orchid?

20:12.842 --> 20:15.762
Well, the sucker's rare. You know?

20:15.866 --> 20:19.672
And I'm the only one in the world
who knows how to cultivate it.

20:19.707 --> 20:23.443
See, the idea was, get the indians
to pull it from the swamp.

20:23.478 --> 20:27.753
I researched it. Long as I don't touch
the plant, Florida can't touch us.

20:28.170 --> 20:33.280
And I stop future poaching by making
the flowers readily available in stores.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.199
I'm a hero, the flowers are saved...

20:36.304 --> 20:38.702
Laroche and nature win.

20:39.953 --> 20:41.517
Great.

20:41.726 --> 20:43.916
Did you get that last part?

20:44.020 --> 20:45.897
Yeah, I sure did.

20:46.001 --> 20:49.094
Orchids are the sexiest flowers
on Earth.

20:49.129 --> 20:54.864
The name orchid derives from the
Latin orchis, which means testicle.

20:54.899 --> 20:56.324
Hey, Charles.

20:56.428 --> 20:58.305
I pitched my screenplay to Mom.

20:58.409 --> 21:00.251
Don't say "pitch."

21:00.286 --> 21:02.789
Sorry. Anyway, she said it was...

21:02.893 --> 21:05.083
Silence of the Lambs
meets Psycho.

21:05.187 --> 21:09.462
Maybe you guys could collaborate.
I hear Mom's really good with structure.

21:11.548 --> 21:13.842
So how come Amelia
doesn't come around anymore?

21:13.946 --> 21:17.179
Did you put the moves on her
or something?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.707
I'm looking for John Laroche.

21:47.522 --> 21:50.233
I'm writing an article on John,
and I stopped by.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.110
- I hoped I could see him.
- John's not here.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.063
Well, you were at the swamp
with him, weren't you?

21:57.098 --> 21:59.826
I saw you at the courthouse,
that's how I know.

21:59.930 --> 22:02.016
I'm Matthew Osceola.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.101
Susan Orlean. Nice to meet you.

22:04.206 --> 22:06.986
Maybe I could talk to you
for a second.

22:07.021 --> 22:09.836
I'm just trying to get a feel
for the whole operation...

22:09.871 --> 22:12.756
You have very beautiful hair.

22:16.823 --> 22:18.960
Thank you very much.

22:18.995 --> 22:21.098
Thank you. I just...

22:21.202 --> 22:25.582
I just washed it this morning.

22:26.624 --> 22:29.127
I just used a new conditioner.

22:33.298 --> 22:36.009
I can see your sadness.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.990
It's lovely.

22:40.076 --> 22:44.351
Well, I'm just tired, that's all.
That's my problem.

22:44.386 --> 22:46.749
So maybe we could chat a little bit...

22:47.062 --> 22:51.024
- And I could get some background-
- I'm not going to talk to you much.

22:51.059 --> 22:52.901
It's not personal.

22:54.361 --> 22:56.134
It's the indian way.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.045
Angraecum sesquipedale.

23:11.670 --> 23:14.242
Beauty! God!

23:14.277 --> 23:16.571
Darwin wrote about this one.

23:17.092 --> 23:21.333
Charles Darwin? Evolution guy?
Hello?

23:21.368 --> 23:23.453
You see that nectary
all the way down there?

23:23.557 --> 23:25.851
Darwin hypothesized a moth...

23:26.268 --> 23:29.709
with a nose 12 inches long
to pollinate it.

23:29.814 --> 23:32.004
Everyone thought he was a loon.

23:32.108 --> 23:36.661
Then, sure enough, they found
this moth with a 12-inch proboscis.

23:36.696 --> 23:39.824
- "Proboscis" means nose, by the way.
- I know what "proboscis" means.

23:39.859 --> 23:44.099
Hey, let's not get off the subject.
This isn't a pissing contest.

23:44.203 --> 23:46.810
The point is,
what's so wonderful...

23:46.915 --> 23:50.147
is that every one of these flowers
has a specific relationship...

23:50.182 --> 23:51.989
with the insect that pollinates it.

23:52.024 --> 23:54.944
There's a certain orchid
looks exactly like a certain insect.

23:54.979 --> 23:57.863
So the insect is drawn to this flower...

23:57.898 --> 24:01.200
its double, its soul mate...

24:01.304 --> 24:04.849
and wants nothing more
than to make love to it.

24:05.162 --> 24:07.456
After the insect flies off...

24:07.561 --> 24:12.461
it spots another soul-mate flower
and makes love to it, thus pollinating it.

24:12.496 --> 24:16.007
And neither the flower nor the insect
will ever understand...

24:16.111 --> 24:19.135
the significance
of their lovemaking.

24:19.239 --> 24:22.993
How could they know that because
of their little dance, the world lives?

24:23.097 --> 24:24.974
But it does.

24:25.078 --> 24:27.268
By simply doing
what they're designed to do...

24:27.372 --> 24:30.031
something large
and magnificent happens.

24:30.066 --> 24:32.690
In this sense, they show us
how to live.

24:32.795 --> 24:36.513
How the only barometer
you have is your heart.

24:36.548 --> 24:42.283
How when you spot your flower,
you can't let anything get in your way.

24:49.583 --> 24:52.502
He's really quite a character.
No front teeth.

24:52.606 --> 24:55.943
- Doesn't seem to bother him at all.
- Why doesn't he get them fixed?

24:55.978 --> 24:59.488
It seems almost sociopathic
to make everybody look at that.

24:59.593 --> 25:02.512
Yeah, but he gives
a great blowjob, honey.

25:04.077 --> 25:06.788
He is a fascinating character, though.

25:06.892 --> 25:09.255
Sounds like a gold mine, Sue.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.905
It could be. I don't know, you know?
He's...

25:12.940 --> 25:17.319
He lives with his dad, he's obsessed
with his dead mother, and...

25:17.354 --> 25:21.699
He wears his sunglasses on
a little dingle-dangle around his neck.

25:21.734 --> 25:23.471
Loving it.

25:24.305 --> 25:27.607
- Tell them about the van.
- Okay, the van. The van.

25:27.642 --> 25:30.875
- I can't tell about the van. I gotta pee.
- No, tell us about the van.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.211
- It's amazing. It's...
- What's in it?

25:34.316 --> 25:37.617
- You did it in the van.
- Shut up.

25:37.652 --> 25:40.363
David, you tell-
Don't you tell them. Don't tell them.

25:40.468 --> 25:42.032
Okay, the van.

25:42.345 --> 25:44.222
David!

25:46.203 --> 25:48.393
This van was filled with junk...

25:48.428 --> 25:49.540
Shut up!

25:49.644 --> 25:53.554
Potting soil. Shovels.
Food wrappers. Fertilizer.

25:53.589 --> 25:57.464
Susie said she hoped
it was fertilizer, anyway.

25:57.569 --> 26:01.322
She said she couldn't be sure. Laroche
had a certain aromatic look about him.

26:01.357 --> 26:02.365
And she said...

26:02.574 --> 26:06.119
She said perhaps his obsessiveness
didn't leave room in his schedule...

26:06.154 --> 26:08.413
for personal hygiene.

26:08.517 --> 26:12.688
Maybe the orchids got
all the available water.

26:13.314 --> 26:19.049
I wanted to want something as much
as people wanted these plants.

26:19.674 --> 26:21.134
But...

26:21.760 --> 26:24.992
it isn't part of my constitution.

26:25.931 --> 26:30.519
I suppose I do have
one unembarrassed passion.

26:32.396 --> 26:37.714
I wanna know what it feels like
to care about something passionately.

26:49.601 --> 26:52.520
"Should one be lucky enough
to see a ghost orchid...

26:52.555 --> 26:55.961
all else will seem eclipsed."

26:58.568 --> 27:01.696
If the ghost orchid
was really a phantom...

27:01.801 --> 27:06.284
it was still such a bewitching one that
it could seduce people to pursue it...

27:06.319 --> 27:09.795
year after year
and mile after miserable mile.

27:09.830 --> 27:13.271
If it was a real flower,
I wanted to see one.

27:13.375 --> 27:17.129
The reason was not that I love orchids.
I don't even especially like orchids.

27:17.164 --> 27:20.778
What I wanted
was to see this thing...

27:20.883 --> 27:27.452
that people were drawn to
in such a singular and powerful way.

27:30.267 --> 27:33.604
So how many turtles
did you end up collecting?

27:33.708 --> 27:36.419
I lost interest right after that.

27:39.130 --> 27:42.259
I dropped turtles when I fell
in love with ice Age fossils.

27:42.363 --> 27:44.935
Collected the shit out of them.

27:44.970 --> 27:49.141
Fossils were the only thing that made
sense to me in this fucked-up world.

27:49.662 --> 27:53.103
I ditched fossils
for resilvering old mirrors.

27:53.207 --> 27:55.258
My mom and I
had the largest collection...

27:55.293 --> 27:58.490
of 19th-century Dutch mirrors
on the planet.

27:58.525 --> 28:01.549
Perhaps you read about us.
Mirror World, October '88?

28:01.584 --> 28:04.260
I got a copy here somewhere.

28:05.616 --> 28:09.057
I guess I'd just like to know
how you can detach from something...

28:09.161 --> 28:11.664
that you've invested
so much of your soul in.

28:11.768 --> 28:16.425
I mean, didn't you ever miss turtles?

28:16.460 --> 28:20.840
The only thing that made
your 10-year-old life worth living?

28:21.257 --> 28:24.698
Look, I'll tell you a story, all right?

28:24.906 --> 28:30.745
I once fell deeply, you know,
profoundly in love with tropical fish.

28:30.780 --> 28:33.265
I had 60 goddamn fish-tanks
in my house.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.716
I'd skin-dive to find just the right ones.

28:35.751 --> 28:41.381
Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus
ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus.

28:41.416 --> 28:43.258
You name it.

28:43.571 --> 28:46.699
Then one day I say, "Fuck fish."

28:46.803 --> 28:51.287
I renounce fish. I vow never
to set foot in that ocean again.

28:51.322 --> 28:54.103
That's how much "fuck fish."

28:54.833 --> 28:59.733
That was 17 years ago, and I have
never since stuck a toe in that ocean.

28:59.768 --> 29:01.923
And I love the ocean.

29:03.279 --> 29:05.051
But why?

29:06.824 --> 29:09.118
Done with fish.

29:09.952 --> 29:14.540
If you'd really loved something,
wouldn't a little bit of it linger?

29:14.575 --> 29:17.773
Evidently Laroche's finishes
were downright and absolute.

29:17.808 --> 29:19.337
He just moved on.

29:19.441 --> 29:23.508
I sometimes wished
I could do the same.

29:28.721 --> 29:31.745
Good afternoon.
So, what looks good today?

29:31.849 --> 29:33.726
The key lime pie, please.

29:33.831 --> 29:35.603
A small slice.

29:35.812 --> 29:38.627
And a coffee, please.
Skim milk, please.

29:39.983 --> 29:43.007
Orchids. I love orchids.

29:43.111 --> 29:44.779
Cool. That's...

29:48.742 --> 29:51.870
Well, I'll be right back with your pie.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.738
I'm so excited. I've always wanted
to come to an orchid show.

30:05.947 --> 30:08.345
I think these flowers are so sexy.

30:10.222 --> 30:12.099
Let's see what's around back.

30:35.143 --> 30:36.394
What?

30:36.499 --> 30:39.418
- You wanna hear my pitch?
- Go away, goddamn it.

30:41.608 --> 30:44.111
You know, I'm just trying
to do something.

30:48.907 --> 30:51.479
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy. Cool.

30:51.514 --> 30:53.704
Okay, there's this serial killer, right?

30:53.808 --> 30:56.623
Well, no, wait.
And he's being hunted by a cop.

30:56.728 --> 31:00.898
And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.

31:00.933 --> 31:03.627
He's already holding her hostage
in his creepy basement.

31:03.662 --> 31:06.321
So the cop gets obsessed
with figuring out her identity...

31:06.356 --> 31:08.788
and in the process
falls in love with her.

31:08.823 --> 31:11.951
Even though he's never even met her.
She becomes like...

31:12.056 --> 31:15.357
Like the unattainable.
Like the Holy Grail.

31:15.392 --> 31:19.146
- It's a little obvious, don't you think?
- Okay, but here's the twist.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.440
We find out that the killer...

31:21.545 --> 31:24.673
really suffers from
multiple personality disorder. Right?

31:24.708 --> 31:28.427
See, he's actually really the cop
and the girl.

31:28.462 --> 31:31.763
All of them are him.
Isn't that fucked up?

31:33.015 --> 31:38.020
The only idea more overused than
serial killers is multiple personality.

31:38.055 --> 31:40.418
On top of that, you explore
the notion...

31:40.522 --> 31:43.755
that cop and criminal are
really two aspects of the same person.

31:43.790 --> 31:46.883
See every cop movie ever made
for other examples of this.

31:46.987 --> 31:49.698
Mom called it psychologically taut.

31:49.802 --> 31:53.765
The other thing is, there's no way
to write this. Did you consider that?

31:53.800 --> 31:58.457
I mean, how could you have somebody
held prisoner in a basement...

31:58.492 --> 32:02.628
and working in a police station
at the same time?

32:03.879 --> 32:06.590
- Trick photography.
- Okay, that's not what I'm asking.

32:06.695 --> 32:09.475
Listen closely.
What I'm asking is:

32:09.510 --> 32:14.619
In the reality of this movie, where
there's only one character, right?

32:14.654 --> 32:16.184
Okay?

32:16.392 --> 32:18.373
How could you...?

32:19.937 --> 32:22.127
What exactly would...?

32:24.108 --> 32:25.985
I agree with Mom. Very taut.

32:26.089 --> 32:29.113
Sybil meets, I don't know...
Dressed to Kill.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.477
Cool. I really liked Dressed to Kill.

32:31.512 --> 32:35.995
- Until the third act denouement.
- That's not how it's pronounced.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.645
Sorry. I-Okay, sorry.

32:45.901 --> 32:49.447
- Some key lime pie for you today?
- Okay, yeah. That sounds great.

32:49.482 --> 32:52.227
I'll cut you an extra-large slice.
Preferred customer.

32:52.262 --> 32:56.120
- Thank you. That's really sweet of you.
- Well, I'm just a sweetie, ain't I?

32:56.433 --> 32:59.613
- Still reading about orchids, I hope?
- Yes, I am.

32:59.648 --> 33:02.794
This friend of mine
has this little, tiny pink one...

33:02.829 --> 33:05.574
that grows on a tree branch
just like that.

33:05.609 --> 33:08.320
- I can't remember-
- That's called an epiphyte.

33:08.424 --> 33:10.579
Right. Right!

33:10.614 --> 33:12.282
Boy, you know your stuff.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.793
No, not really. I'm just learning.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.817
Epiphytes grow on trees,
but they're not parasites.

33:18.852 --> 33:21.563
They get all their nourishment
from the air and the rain.

33:22.188 --> 33:25.838
Well, I'm impressed. That's great.

33:26.255 --> 33:29.070
There are more than 30.000 kinds
of orchids in the world.

33:29.383 --> 33:32.824
- That's a lot?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:32.859 --> 33:34.075
Yeah.

33:34.284 --> 33:39.602
So I'll be right back with an extra-large
slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

33:39.706 --> 33:43.043
But-So anyway,
I was also wondering...

33:44.607 --> 33:49.195
I'm going up to Santa Barbara this
Saturday for an orchid show, and I...

33:51.802 --> 33:53.227
- I'm sorry.
- Well...

33:53.262 --> 33:57.328
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- So I'll just be right back with your pie.

34:07.130 --> 34:11.822
There are more than 30.000
known orchid species.

34:11.857 --> 34:14.221
One looks like a turtle.

34:14.533 --> 34:17.244
One looks like a monkey.

34:17.766 --> 34:20.233
One looks like an onion.

34:20.268 --> 34:22.353
One looks like a schoolteacher.

34:22.562 --> 34:24.335
One looks like a gymnast.

34:24.543 --> 34:27.463
One looks like that girl in high school
with creamy skin.

34:27.985 --> 34:29.966
One looks like a New York
intellectual...

34:30.070 --> 34:33.197
with whom you do the Sunday
Times crossword puzzle in bed.

34:33.302 --> 34:36.014
One looks like a Midwestern
beauty queen.

34:36.118 --> 34:38.411
One looks like Amelia.

34:38.516 --> 34:40.289
One has eyes that dance.

34:40.393 --> 34:44.251
One has eyes that contain
the sadness of the world.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.489
So I got married,
and me and my beautiful new wife...

34:52.592 --> 34:55.617
my now ex-wife, the bitch...

34:56.451 --> 34:58.606
opened up a nursery.

34:58.641 --> 35:01.873
People started coming out
of the woodwork to ask me stuff...

35:01.978 --> 35:05.627
and admire my plants
and admire me.

35:07.504 --> 35:12.196
I think some people were really spending
time with me because they were lonely.

35:18.348 --> 35:21.059
And you know why I like plants?

35:23.666 --> 35:26.273
Because they're so mutable.

35:27.733 --> 35:31.382
Adaptation's a profound process.

35:31.695 --> 35:33.259
It means you...

35:33.364 --> 35:36.909
figure out how to thrive in the world.

35:41.184 --> 35:44.417
Yeah, but it's easier for plants.
I mean...

35:44.452 --> 35:46.294
they have no memory.

35:47.023 --> 35:51.611
You know, they just move on to
whatever's next. But a person, now...

35:53.176 --> 35:56.408
adapting's almost shameful.
I mean, it's like...

35:56.443 --> 35:58.911
running away.

36:33.321 --> 36:35.719
Keener!

36:47.606 --> 36:49.900
Hey, man.

36:50.317 --> 36:52.368
Please don't hit
on crew members, Donald.

36:52.403 --> 36:56.469
What, the makeup girl?
She was hitting on me, bro.

36:57.408 --> 36:59.910
Don't embarrass me.
I have to work with these people.

36:59.945 --> 37:03.351
I won't. Anyway, listen...

37:03.455 --> 37:07.418
I meant to ask you,
I need a cool way to kill people.

37:09.295 --> 37:12.179
Don't worry. For my script.

37:12.214 --> 37:14.404
I don't write that kind of stuff.

37:14.508 --> 37:18.367
Come on, man, please?
You're the genius.

37:19.201 --> 37:22.120
Here you go: The killer's
a literature professor.

37:22.225 --> 37:26.187
He cuts off little chunks from his
victim's bodies until they die.

37:26.291 --> 37:29.628
He calls himself
"The Deconstructionist."

37:31.088 --> 37:35.259
- That's kind of good. I like that.
- See, I was kidding, Donald.

37:36.197 --> 37:38.699
Okay. Sorry.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.202
You got me.

37:42.871 --> 37:45.582
Do you mind if I use it, though?

37:52.985 --> 37:56.634
- It's really good.
- I tried to split the Cassie scene in half...

37:56.669 --> 38:00.249
- From the beginning to the end.
- I saw that. Why did you do that?

38:00.284 --> 38:04.351
Because I wanted there to be more
tension. And then you pick it up later...

38:04.386 --> 38:06.958
- But are you changing...?
- Keeps more tension.

38:07.062 --> 38:10.712
That way the audience
gets stuck early on.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.901
- You like it?
- I really like it.

38:22.807 --> 38:24.893
You look hot tonight, baby.

38:24.997 --> 38:29.168
Thanks, Donald.
That's swell of you to say.

38:29.793 --> 38:33.339
- Don't you think she's hot, bro?
- I'm heading home, Donald.

38:33.374 --> 38:35.424
Really? Come on.

38:35.528 --> 38:38.344
Hey, it's Amelia.

38:38.969 --> 38:40.325
Hey, Amelia!

38:40.638 --> 38:44.079
Hey, Donald. Hey, Charlie.

38:44.600 --> 38:48.927
- Hey. Hi there.
- God, Amelia, we don't see you anymore.

38:48.962 --> 38:53.255
- It's good to see you.
- This is my girlfriend, Caroline.

38:53.359 --> 38:55.966
- She's a makeup artist for the movies.
- Hi.

38:57.009 --> 38:58.990
Hi.

38:59.094 --> 39:00.763
This is David, my friend.

39:01.910 --> 39:03.856
- Hi.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

39:03.891 --> 39:06.706
- Amelia's talked a lot about you.
- Hi, I'm Donald.

39:06.810 --> 39:09.382
- Hey.
- Caroline.

39:09.417 --> 39:11.086
- Cool camera.
- So how are you?

39:11.815 --> 39:15.048
- You know me, a mess.
- Charlie...

39:15.152 --> 39:17.655
it's really good to see you.
Is the work good?

39:17.759 --> 39:19.949
It's a disaster.
I don't know what I'm doing.

39:20.053 --> 39:22.764
But, anyway, it's my problem.
I don't want to bore you.

39:22.868 --> 39:26.726
You have your own stuff, right? I mean,
we both have our own separate stuff.

39:26.761 --> 39:29.646
Anyway, I should go. I was just
heading home to do some work.

39:29.750 --> 39:33.191
- You coming?
- No, I'm gonna stay at Caroline's tonight.

39:33.226 --> 39:36.111
A little push, push in the bush.

39:36.146 --> 39:39.656
Donald, you're such a tard!

39:39.691 --> 39:41.533
See you, Charlie.

39:46.121 --> 39:48.937
To write about a flower,
to dramatize a flower...

39:49.041 --> 39:51.022
I have to show the flower's arc.

39:51.126 --> 39:54.359
And the flower's arc stretches back
to the beginning of life.

39:54.463 --> 39:57.696
How did this flower get here?
What was its journey?

39:58.217 --> 40:01.345
Therefore, I should infer
from analogy...

40:03.431 --> 40:07.601
that probably all the organic beings
which have ever lived on this Earth...

40:07.636 --> 40:13.024
have descended
from some one primordial form...

40:13.059 --> 40:16.065
into which life was first breathed.

40:16.100 --> 40:19.072
It is a journey of evolution.
Adaptation.

40:19.176 --> 40:23.086
The journey we all take. A journey
that unites each and every one of us.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.996
Darwin writes that we all come
from the very first single-cell organism.

40:27.413 --> 40:28.769
Yet here I am.

40:29.082 --> 40:31.654
And there's Laroche.
There's Orlean.

40:31.689 --> 40:35.442
And there's the ghost orchid.
All trapped in our own bodies...

40:35.547 --> 40:38.744
in moments in history.
That's it.

40:38.779 --> 40:43.054
That's what I need to do.
Tie all of history together.

40:44.723 --> 40:47.538
Start right before
life begins on the planet.

40:47.642 --> 40:48.963
All is...

40:48.998 --> 40:51.987
lifeless.
And then, like, life begins...

40:52.022 --> 40:54.281
with organisms.
Those little single-cell ones.

40:54.316 --> 40:57.444
And it's before sex, because,
like, everything was asexual.

40:57.548 --> 41:00.051
From there we go to bigger things.
Jellyfish.

41:00.155 --> 41:02.866
Then that fish that got legs
and crawled out on the land.

41:02.970 --> 41:06.272
And then we see,
you know, like, dinosaurs.

41:06.307 --> 41:11.312
And then they're around for a long time.
Then an asteroid comes and:

41:11.347 --> 41:14.545
The insects, the mammals,
the primates, monkeys.

41:14.649 --> 41:18.299
The simple monkeys. Old-fashioned
monkeys giving way to the new ones.

41:18.334 --> 41:20.801
Whatever. And then apes.
Whatever. And man.

41:20.905 --> 41:25.598
Then we see the whole history of
human civilization.: hunting, war, love...

41:25.633 --> 41:27.787
heartache, disease,
loneliness, technology.

41:27.892 --> 41:31.958
And we end with Susan Orlean
in her office at The New Yorker...

41:32.063 --> 41:34.565
writing about flowers, and bang!
The movie begins.

41:34.669 --> 41:38.423
This is the breakthrough I've been
hoping for. It's never been done.

41:38.458 --> 41:41.551
McKee is a genius!

41:41.968 --> 41:46.869
And hilarious. He just comes up with all
these great jokes, and everybody laughs.

41:47.495 --> 41:49.998
But he's serious too, Charles.
You'd love him.

41:50.102 --> 41:53.021
He's all for originality, just like you.

41:53.126 --> 41:57.192
But he says we have to realize
that we all write in a genre...

41:57.227 --> 42:00.425
and we must find our originality
within that genre.

42:02.302 --> 42:06.056
There hasn't been a new genre since
Fellini invented the mockumentary.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.975
My genre's thriller. What's yours?

42:09.079 --> 42:13.250
You and I share the same DNA.

42:13.772 --> 42:16.796
Is there anything more lonely than that?

42:16.831 --> 42:18.151
What'd you say, bro?

42:24.512 --> 42:26.597
- Yeah?
- Hey.

42:26.702 --> 42:29.517
Hey, Susie-Q.

42:29.621 --> 42:30.664
What you up to?

42:31.185 --> 42:35.252
I don't wanna bother you. Just thought
I'd call and get some more info.

42:36.086 --> 42:40.570
I think you say some
pretty smart things, John.

42:40.674 --> 42:42.655
Yeah, smartest guy I know?

42:45.575 --> 42:47.765
So...

42:47.869 --> 42:50.789
whatever happened
to your nursery?

42:54.125 --> 42:56.593
It was going pretty well.

42:56.628 --> 43:01.737
But, you know, sometimes bad
things happen, darkness descends.

43:10.705 --> 43:12.947
Nursery business good, Johnny?

43:12.982 --> 43:15.189
Everything's good, Uncle Jim.

43:15.293 --> 43:17.795
This last year's been a dream.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.819
I'm telling you.
Finally pulling out of debt.

43:20.924 --> 43:24.052
Amen, honey.
I'm so proud of you two, and...

43:40.944 --> 43:43.029
No, ma'am. I'm sorry,
I can't answer that.

43:43.064 --> 43:44.802
- Stay right there.
- Hey.

43:46.158 --> 43:49.181
- Hold it. Which ones are dead?
- Sir, please, don't move.

43:49.216 --> 43:53.352
- Which ones are dead?
- Let's move it!

43:56.898 --> 44:01.903
I killed my mom, you know,
and my uncle.

44:02.737 --> 44:05.865
That's how I lost my front teeth.

44:07.951 --> 44:12.956
And my wife was in a coma
for, like, three weeks.

44:13.581 --> 44:17.439
And she divorced me soon after
she regained consciousness.

44:30.891 --> 44:36.626
Well, I think if I almost died,
I would leave my marriage too.

44:38.398 --> 44:40.379
Why?

44:40.797 --> 44:43.195
Because I could.

44:43.299 --> 44:47.366
Because it's like a free pass.
Nobody can judge you...

44:47.470 --> 44:50.650
if you almost died.

44:50.685 --> 44:53.831
Well, I judged her.

44:54.978 --> 44:57.167
Maybe I was being judged too.

44:59.044 --> 45:03.841
It was like a month after that, Hurricane
Andrew came along and just...

45:03.876 --> 45:06.343
swooped down
like an angel of God...

45:08.325 --> 45:12.287
and just wiped out everything
I had left.

45:13.643 --> 45:15.728
Everything.

45:15.832 --> 45:19.482
I knew it'd break my heart
to start another nursery...

45:19.517 --> 45:22.471
so, you know,
when the Seminoles called...

45:22.506 --> 45:28.241
they wanted a white guy or an expert
to get their nursery going, I took the job.

45:28.276 --> 45:33.350
I wasn't gonna give them a
conventional little potted-plant place.

45:33.872 --> 45:36.166
I was gonna give them something...

45:36.270 --> 45:39.346
amazing, you know?

45:39.381 --> 45:42.422
Yeah, I know, John.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.889
I know.

45:44.924 --> 45:47.844
"I was going to give them
something amazing."

45:50.138 --> 45:53.371
It's beautifully written.
You have such a unique voice.

45:53.406 --> 45:56.151
Thank you very much.

45:56.186 --> 45:59.418
- We're big fans.
- Thank you.

45:59.523 --> 46:02.234
Laroche is such a fun character.

46:03.172 --> 46:05.675
- Yeah.
- It's funny and fresh.

46:05.883 --> 46:08.386
And sad in a way.

46:08.490 --> 46:10.576
So we were wondering what's next.

46:10.680 --> 46:13.808
Well, Random House has asked me...

46:13.912 --> 46:16.623
to expand it into a book,
so I'm gonna be doing that.

46:16.728 --> 46:19.856
- And-
- Susan, we would like to option this.

46:22.046 --> 46:25.487
- You wanna make it into a movie?
- Into a movie.

46:25.522 --> 46:27.259
Oh, God!

46:28.302 --> 46:31.326
- That's really...
- How does that sound?

46:31.361 --> 46:33.307
- That's very exciting.
- Good.

46:33.411 --> 46:37.582
It's just comical. I hadn't thought of it.
I've never written a screenplay before.

46:37.617 --> 46:41.649
Don't worry about that. We have
screenwriters to write the screenplay.

46:45.716 --> 46:48.427
Hey, superstar.
It's Marty, super agent.

46:48.531 --> 46:51.555
I just wanna remind you
it's been 13 weeks...

46:51.659 --> 46:53.536
and Valerie's anxious
to see a draft.

46:53.640 --> 46:56.873
So if you could wrap things up and
get it to her by Monday, that'd be great.

46:56.908 --> 47:00.522
Call me when you get this.
Adios, amigo.

47:04.380 --> 47:08.551
What? What'd you laugh at?

47:09.594 --> 47:11.680
- You're a genius.
- Which line?

47:11.784 --> 47:13.452
You're a genius.
You're a genius.

47:39.729 --> 47:42.301
"We see orchid hunter
Augustus Margary."

47:42.336 --> 47:46.611
He wears a filthy, spittle-soak ed
rag around his head to quell the pain.

47:46.646 --> 47:50.886
The back of his trousers are stained
greasy black from an anal leakage...

47:50.921 --> 47:52.555
due to dysentery.

47:52.659 --> 47:58.602
"He moans with each tentative step
through the overgrown jungle."

47:58.637 --> 48:00.062
I'm fuck ed.

48:00.166 --> 48:04.442
We open with Laroche. He's funny.
He says, "I love to mutate plants."

48:04.477 --> 48:07.466
He says, "Mutation is fun."
Okay, we show flowers and... Okay.

48:07.570 --> 48:09.447
We have to have the court case.
We show Laroche.

48:09.551 --> 48:12.366
He says, "I was mutated as a baby.
That's why I'm so smart."

48:12.471 --> 48:15.182
That's funny. Okay, we open
at the beginning of time. No!

48:15.217 --> 48:17.893
- Laroche is driving into the swamp.
- Crazy White Man!

48:24.775 --> 48:28.112
I don't know how to adapt this.
I should have stuck with my own stuff.

48:28.216 --> 48:30.406
I don't know why I thought
I could write this.

48:30.441 --> 48:31.657
See her?

48:32.491 --> 48:35.098
I fucked her up the ass.

48:35.133 --> 48:37.288
No. I'm kidding.

48:39.477 --> 48:41.980
Maybe I can help.

48:47.819 --> 48:50.739
It's about flowers.

48:51.156 --> 48:53.450
Okay.

48:53.971 --> 48:58.246
But it's not only about flowers, right?
You have the crazy plant-nut guy, right?

48:58.281 --> 49:00.645
He's funny. Right?

49:04.294 --> 49:07.840
"There's not nearly enough of him
to fill a book."

49:07.944 --> 49:12.914
So Orlean "digresses in long
passages." Blah, blah, blah.

49:12.949 --> 49:15.660
"No narrative unites these passages."
New York Times Book Review.

49:15.695 --> 49:19.518
I can't structure this. It's that
sprawling New Yorker shit.

49:19.553 --> 49:21.708
Man, I'd fuck her up the ass.

49:24.106 --> 49:27.130
- Sorry.
- The book has no story. There's no story.

49:27.234 --> 49:29.216
All right. Make one up.

49:29.320 --> 49:33.386
I mean, nobody in this town
can make up a crazy story like you.

49:33.421 --> 49:37.453
- You're the king of that.
- No, I didn't want to do that this time.

49:37.557 --> 49:42.110
It's someone else's material.
I have a responsibility to Susan...

49:42.145 --> 49:46.421
Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer.
I wanted to do something simple.

49:46.456 --> 49:49.757
Show people how amazing
flowers are.

49:50.279 --> 49:52.051
Are they amazing?

49:54.450 --> 49:58.099
I don't know. I think they are.

50:01.436 --> 50:04.564
- I need you to get me out of this.
- All right.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.700
Charlie, you've been stringing
them along for months now.

50:08.735 --> 50:13.636
Not to give them anything at this
point would be a terrible career move.

50:21.769 --> 50:23.959
Hey, my script's going amazing.

50:24.167 --> 50:26.461
Right now, I'm working out
an image system.

50:26.566 --> 50:30.267
Because of my multiple personality
theme, I've chosen a motif...

50:30.302 --> 50:33.934
of broken mirrors to show my
protagonist's fragmented self.

50:33.969 --> 50:38.453
Bob says an image system increases
the complexity of an aesthetic emotion.

50:38.488 --> 50:40.747
- Bob says-
- You sound like you're in a cult.

50:40.851 --> 50:44.048
No, it's just good writing technique.

50:44.083 --> 50:47.420
I made you a copy
of McKee's 10 Commandments.

50:47.524 --> 50:50.131
I posted one over
both our work areas.

50:59.829 --> 51:01.914
You shouldn't have done that.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.275
Because it's extremely helpful.
Hey, Charles, I'm putting a song on.

51:08.310 --> 51:09.630
"Happy Together."

51:09.735 --> 51:12.863
Like when characters sing songs
in their pajamas and dance around.

51:12.967 --> 51:14.740
I thought it'd break the tension.

51:14.844 --> 51:18.250
At first I was nervous
about putting a song in a thriller...

51:18.285 --> 51:23.082
but Bob says that Casablanca, one of
the greatest screenplays ever written...

51:23.117 --> 51:25.862
did exactly that. Mixed genres.

51:25.897 --> 51:28.608
I haven't slept in a week, Donald.

51:28.712 --> 51:31.736
- I need to go to bed.
- Okay.

51:32.258 --> 51:34.134
Good night.

51:40.078 --> 51:42.789
- Yeah?
- Hi.

51:42.893 --> 51:44.979
John, it's Susan again.

51:45.083 --> 51:48.211
Hey, Susie-Q.

51:49.254 --> 51:51.027
How's it going?

51:51.235 --> 51:54.468
Great. I'm training myself
on the internet.

51:54.885 --> 51:57.283
It's fascinating.
I'm doing pornography.

51:57.387 --> 52:01.558
It's amazing how much these suckers
will pay for photographs of chicks.

52:01.593 --> 52:05.625
It doesn't matter if they're fat
or ugly or what.

52:05.660 --> 52:07.293
Well, that sounds good.

52:07.398 --> 52:10.178
It's great, is what it is.

52:10.213 --> 52:14.905
Listen, John, I hate feeling like
I'm being a pain to you, but I...

52:14.940 --> 52:16.782
I still haven't seen a ghost.

52:16.886 --> 52:21.787
- Yeah?
- And I was hoping maybe you'd...

52:21.822 --> 52:23.039
Yeah.

52:23.247 --> 52:25.020
Yeah, I'll take you in.

52:25.124 --> 52:28.044
- Tomorrow.
- Really?

52:28.878 --> 52:32.319
Thank you so much.

52:32.423 --> 52:33.987
Oh, John.

52:35.030 --> 52:36.698
Damn it.

52:48.273 --> 52:52.026
There are too many ideas
and things and people.

52:52.131 --> 52:54.112
Too many directions to go.

52:54.216 --> 52:59.117
I was starting to believe the reason
it matters to care about something...

52:59.221 --> 53:01.411
is that it whittles the world down...

53:01.515 --> 53:05.269
to a more manageable size.

53:05.304 --> 53:09.231
Such sweet, sad insights.

53:10.274 --> 53:12.777
So true.

53:25.707 --> 53:28.730
I like looking at you.

53:30.086 --> 53:33.006
I like looking at you too, Charlie.

54:10.857 --> 54:12.629
I don't know how to do this.

54:13.151 --> 54:16.331
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

54:16.366 --> 54:19.511
You've written a beautiful book.

54:19.616 --> 54:22.327
I can't sleep.

54:23.682 --> 54:26.915
I'm losing my hair.
I'm fat and repulsive.

54:27.019 --> 54:30.669
You're not. You're not.

54:31.711 --> 54:35.308
Just whittle it down, you know?

54:35.343 --> 54:38.906
Focus on one thing in the story.

54:39.532 --> 54:42.139
Find that one thing...

54:42.243 --> 54:45.684
that you care passionately about...

54:45.719 --> 54:47.874
and then write about that.

54:47.978 --> 54:51.315
We see Susan Orlean:
Delicate, haunted by loneliness...

54:51.419 --> 54:52.948
fragile, beautiful.

54:52.983 --> 54:57.050
She lies awake next to her sleeping,
insensitive husband.

54:57.154 --> 54:58.405
Her voice-over begins:

54:58.822 --> 55:02.785
"I suppose I do
have one unembarrassed passion.

55:03.202 --> 55:07.477
I want to know how it feels to care
about something passionately."

55:10.918 --> 55:13.316
- Hey.
- Morning.

55:13.420 --> 55:18.078
Hey, you two. Up early for a change?

55:18.113 --> 55:22.770
- You seem chipper.
- I'm good. I have some new ideas.

55:22.805 --> 55:27.879
God, you guys are so smart.
It's like a brain factory in here.

55:27.914 --> 55:32.815
- I got some ideas too this morning.
- He got really, really good ones.

55:32.850 --> 55:35.214
You know, in a Donald sort of way.

55:35.318 --> 55:38.029
I'm putting-Hey! What?

55:40.114 --> 55:43.243
I'm putting in a chase sequence.
So the killer...

55:43.347 --> 55:46.788
flees on horseback with the girl.
The cop's after them on a motorcycle.

55:46.823 --> 55:49.603
And it's like a battle between
motors and horses.

55:49.638 --> 55:52.523
Like technology versus horse.

55:52.627 --> 55:55.025
And they're still all one person, right?

55:55.547 --> 55:57.701
Well, that's the big payoff.

55:57.736 --> 56:00.621
- It sounds exciting.
- Thanks, man.

56:00.656 --> 56:03.784
- Thanks.
- See, I told you he was gonna like it.

56:04.306 --> 56:09.311
- You're my muse. You are.
- I love being your muse.

56:09.624 --> 56:12.230
I'm so happy about that.

56:13.482 --> 56:16.089
I'm picking up an order for Kaufman.

56:34.336 --> 56:36.282
- Valerie.
- Hi, Charlie.

56:36.317 --> 56:38.368
It's quite a coincidence
bumping into you.

56:38.403 --> 56:41.218
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I was away last week.

56:41.253 --> 56:43.304
- That's okay.
- I meant to because...

56:43.408 --> 56:45.911
things are going really well now,
and I wanted you to know.

56:46.015 --> 56:48.274
Well, that's great.
I'm anxious to see something.

56:48.309 --> 56:51.072
You should sit down because
I'm here with Susan right now.

56:51.107 --> 56:53.835
And she's dying to meet you,
so it's funny bumping into you.

56:53.940 --> 56:55.295
- Have a seat.
- Susan Orlean is here?

56:55.399 --> 57:00.509
Yeah, she's here in town for a reading
or something. She's just on the phone.

57:01.343 --> 57:04.158
Sit down. Have a seat.
She's dying to meet you.

57:06.244 --> 57:09.581
Well, I should probably go, because...

57:09.616 --> 57:11.457
Well, I'd love to meet her too...

57:11.562 --> 57:14.690
but I don't want to be beholden.
And, well...

57:14.794 --> 57:17.818
Because once you meet somebody
that you've been writing about...

57:17.853 --> 57:20.321
it becomes very hard to separate.
So...

57:20.425 --> 57:23.136
Well, okay, I'll speak to you soon.
And I'm almost done.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.283
I'm almost done.

57:24.387 --> 57:27.515
And tell Susan that I would
love to meet with her at a future date.

57:27.550 --> 57:29.288
- As she sees fit.
- Okay.

57:32.416 --> 57:34.971
Who am I kidding?
This is not Susan Orlean's story.

57:35.006 --> 57:37.491
I have no connection with her.
I can't even meet her.

57:37.526 --> 57:40.758
I have no understanding of anything
but my own panic and self-loathing...

57:40.793 --> 57:42.322
and pathetic, little existence.

57:42.531 --> 57:46.702
The only thing I'm actually qualified to
write about is myself and my own self...

57:46.737 --> 57:48.266
We open on Charlie Kaufman.

57:48.370 --> 57:53.062
Fat, old, bald, repulsive, sitting in
a Hollywood restaurant...

57:53.097 --> 57:57.755
across from Valerie Thomas,
a lovely, statuesque film executive.

57:57.790 --> 58:00.570
Kaufman, trying to get
a writing assignment...

58:00.674 --> 58:03.802
wanting to impress her,
sweats profusely.

58:07.139 --> 58:12.422
Fat, bald Kaufman paces furiously
in his bedroom.

58:12.457 --> 58:16.107
He speaks into his hand-held
tape recorder, and he says:

58:18.609 --> 58:20.903
"Charlie Kaufman, fat, bald,
repulsive, old...

58:21.007 --> 58:23.614
sits at a Hollywood restaurant
with Valerie Thomas."

58:23.719 --> 58:25.491
Kaufman, repugnant, ridiculous...

58:25.596 --> 58:27.994
jerks off to the book jack et photo
of Susan Or...

58:28.307 --> 58:29.836
What do you want?

58:29.871 --> 58:31.643
I've finished my script.

58:32.373 --> 58:33.833
I'm done.

58:36.544 --> 58:38.734
So would you show it to your agent?

58:39.881 --> 58:42.175
It's called The Three.

58:46.763 --> 58:49.057
Thanks. I also want to
thank you for your idea.

58:49.161 --> 58:51.351
It was very helpful.
I changed it a little.

58:51.455 --> 58:55.209
Now the killer cuts off body pieces
and makes his victims eat them.

58:55.313 --> 58:58.650
Caroline has this great tattoo of a snake
swallowing its own tail, and...

58:58.685 --> 59:01.882
- Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that means.

59:01.917 --> 59:04.176
The snake. It's called Ourobouros.

59:04.281 --> 59:07.722
I don't think so. But it's cool for my
killer to have this modus operandi...

59:07.826 --> 59:10.746
because when he forces the woman
who's really him to eat herself...

59:10.850 --> 59:12.623
he's also eating himself to death.

59:12.658 --> 59:14.082
I'm insane.

59:14.500 --> 59:17.384
- I'm Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that word means.

59:17.419 --> 59:21.382
- I've written myself into my screenplay.
- That's kind of weird?

59:21.417 --> 59:24.405
It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic.

59:24.510 --> 59:27.012
It's solipsistic. It's pathetic.

59:27.117 --> 59:29.167
I'm pathetic.
I'm fat and pathetic.

59:29.202 --> 59:32.921
I'm sure you had good reasons, Charles.
You're an artist.

59:32.956 --> 59:36.293
It's because I'm too timid to speak to
the woman who wrote the book.

59:36.328 --> 59:38.274
Because I'm pathetic.

59:38.378 --> 59:42.549
Because I have no idea how to write.
Because I can't make flowers fascinating.

59:42.966 --> 59:44.530
Because I suck.

59:44.739 --> 59:47.867
- Hey, am I in the script?
- I'm going to New York.

59:48.805 --> 59:51.412
I'll meet her. That's it.
That's what I have to do.

59:51.516 --> 59:53.289
Don't get mad at me for saying this...

59:53.393 --> 59:55.687
but Bob's having a seminar
in New York this weekend.

59:55.792 --> 59:57.669
So if you're stuck...

59:58.398 --> 01:00:02.569
And she said,
"Laroche is such a fun character."

01:00:02.604 --> 01:00:04.968
No shit, I'm a fun character.

01:00:05.003 --> 01:00:06.323
Who's gonna play me?

01:00:06.427 --> 01:00:08.721
Well, I've gotta write
the book first, John.

01:00:08.826 --> 01:00:11.745
Then, you know, they get somebody
to write the screenplay.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.039
Hey, I think I should play me.

01:00:14.352 --> 01:00:19.844
Most people yearn for something
exceptional, something so inspiring...

01:00:19.879 --> 01:00:25.197
that they'd want to risk everything
for that passion, but few would act on it.

01:00:25.232 --> 01:00:28.429
It was very powerful...

01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:33.017
and it's intoxicating to be
around someone so alive.

01:00:33.052 --> 01:00:36.041
Come on, just follow me.
They're right nearby.

01:00:36.249 --> 01:00:37.814
Okay.

01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:51.265
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:54.184
Look, we're not lost.

01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:17.089
I've done this a million times.

01:01:17.124 --> 01:01:21.608
When everything is killing me, I just say,
"Screw it," and go straight ahead.

01:01:30.471 --> 01:01:32.140
Oh, fuck...

01:01:37.666 --> 01:01:39.126
Sundial.

01:01:40.169 --> 01:01:43.262
I'll just set this up,
we'll wait a few minutes...

01:01:43.297 --> 01:01:46.634
and then we'll be able to tell
which way the sun's moving.

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:49.345
We should be headed southeast.

01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:57.165
So, you collect anything?

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.042
Not really, no.

01:01:59.772 --> 01:02:02.170
Yeah, well, you know...

01:02:02.275 --> 01:02:05.090
it's not really about
collecting the thing.

01:02:05.194 --> 01:02:08.740
It's about being able...

01:02:11.138 --> 01:02:13.536
The thing about computers,
the thing I like...

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.205
is that I'm immersed in them...

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:20.210
but it's not like a living thing
that's gonna leave or die or something.

01:02:26.883 --> 01:02:29.803
- John, I'm sorry. I just-
- Okay.

01:02:30.533 --> 01:02:32.618
- I don't-
- Hey. Okay.

01:02:32.653 --> 01:02:34.356
Fuck the sundial.

01:02:34.391 --> 01:02:37.519
I know how to get out of here.
I know how to get out of here.

01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:40.490
I know this swamp like
the back of my goddamn hand.

01:02:40.525 --> 01:02:43.323
You're just like everybody else.
Fucking leeches.

01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:47.529
You just attach yourself to me
and suck me dry, spit me out.

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:51.074
Why don't you get your own fucking life?
Your own fucking interests?

01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:53.577
Fucking spoiled bitch.

01:02:58.791 --> 01:03:04.630
Life seemed to be filled with things
that were just like the ghost orchid.

01:03:04.665 --> 01:03:09.218
Wonderful to imagine
and easy to fall in love with...

01:03:09.739 --> 01:03:12.138
but a little fantastic...

01:03:12.242 --> 01:03:14.223
and fleeting...

01:03:14.744 --> 01:03:16.621
and out of reach.

01:03:28.821 --> 01:03:33.305
" But a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

01:05:13.407 --> 01:05:14.728
Hello?

01:05:14.763 --> 01:05:16.848
Hey, it's Marty. How's it going?

01:05:16.952 --> 01:05:19.872
Has it been helpful talking to the writer?
What's her name?

01:05:19.976 --> 01:05:22.374
Susan Orlean. It's been okay.

01:05:23.313 --> 01:05:26.024
Well, I mean, are you making headway?

01:05:26.128 --> 01:05:28.214
Valerie's breathing down my neck.

01:05:29.048 --> 01:05:33.115
- You can't rush inspiration.
- Okay. All right. Fair enough.

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:36.764
Listen, the other reason
I called was The Three.

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:38.850
It's just amazing.

01:05:39.475 --> 01:05:42.082
- I don't know what that is.
- Donald's script.

01:05:42.186 --> 01:05:46.044
A smart, edgy thriller.
It's the best script I've read all year.

01:05:51.988 --> 01:05:55.012
- Good.
- Yeah, I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.

01:05:55.116 --> 01:05:57.931
Two fucking talented guys in one family.

01:05:58.036 --> 01:06:02.363
In fact, maybe you could get your
brother to help you with the orchid thing.

01:06:02.398 --> 01:06:06.690
- Marty, don't say that. I mean-
- All right. It's just a thought, buddy.

01:06:06.725 --> 01:06:10.340
I mean, he's really
goddamn amazing at structure.

01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:12.738
- I have to go.
- All right. Adios, amigo.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:14.094
Finish that...

01:06:18.473 --> 01:06:19.933
Fuck!

01:06:29.422 --> 01:06:31.716
Okay, thank you, thank you.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.601
We have a long three days ahead.

01:06:34.636 --> 01:06:39.328
Years from now, you'll be at a posh
cocktail party congratulating yourself...

01:06:39.432 --> 01:06:45.376
on how you spent a weekend with
an asshole from Hollywood for your art.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:48.712
- I am pathetic. I am a loser.
- So...

01:06:48.817 --> 01:06:51.215
what is the substance of writing?

01:06:51.319 --> 01:06:54.760
I have failed. I am panicked.
I have sold out. I am worthless.

01:06:54.795 --> 01:06:57.576
I- What the fuck am I doing here?

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.765
What the fuck am I doing here? Fuck!

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:04.249
It is my weakness, my ultimate lack
of conviction that brings me here.

01:07:04.284 --> 01:07:07.238
Easy answers,
rules to shortcut yourself to success.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:10.679
And here I am because my jaunt
into the abyss brought me nothing.

01:07:10.714 --> 01:07:13.911
Well, isn't that just the risk one takes
for attempting something new?

01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:17.909
I should leave right now. I'll start over.
I need to face this project head-on...

01:07:18.013 --> 01:07:21.663
And God help you if you use
voice-over in your work, my friends.

01:07:21.698 --> 01:07:25.312
God help you.
It's flaccid, sloppy writing.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:30.422
Any idiot can write voice-over narration
to explain the thoughts of the character.

01:07:30.526 --> 01:07:32.299
Okay, that's it.
One hour for lunch.

01:07:36.365 --> 01:07:39.389
You cannot have a protagonist
without desire.

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:43.351
It doesn't make any sense.
Any fucking sense.

01:07:44.186 --> 01:07:47.001
You follow? Good.

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:49.712
Anyone else?

01:07:53.883 --> 01:07:58.784
What if a writer is attempting to create
a story where nothing much happens?

01:07:58.819 --> 01:08:02.225
Where people don't change,
they don't have any epiphanies.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:06.291
They struggle and are frustrated,
and nothing is resolved.

01:08:06.326 --> 01:08:08.481
More a reflection of the real world.

01:08:09.003 --> 01:08:10.775
The real world?

01:08:11.192 --> 01:08:12.513
Yes, sir.

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:14.807
The real fucking world.

01:08:14.842 --> 01:08:18.700
First of all, you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis...

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:21.932
you'll bore your audience to tears.

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:25.060
Secondly, nothing happens in the world?

01:08:25.895 --> 01:08:28.814
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:31.734
People are murdered every day.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.140
There's genocide, war, corruption.

01:08:35.175 --> 01:08:37.955
Every fucking day,
somewhere in the world...

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:40.493
somebody sacrifices his life
to save somebody else.

01:08:40.596 --> 01:08:44.143
Every fucking day, someone somewhere
takes a conscious decision...

01:08:44.178 --> 01:08:46.645
to destroy someone else.

01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:49.148
People find love. People lose it.

01:08:49.252 --> 01:08:53.944
Christ, a child watches a mother
beaten to death on the steps of a church.

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:55.508
Someone goes hungry.

01:08:55.613 --> 01:08:59.054
Somebody else betrays
his best friend for a woman.

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:01.973
If you can't find that stuff in life...

01:09:02.078 --> 01:09:05.413
then you, my friend,
don't know crap about life!

01:09:05.519 --> 01:09:11.462
And why the fuck are you wasting
my two precious hours with your movie?

01:09:12.087 --> 01:09:14.173
I don't have any use for it!

01:09:14.277 --> 01:09:18.136
I don't have any bloody use for it!

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.158
Okay, thanks.

01:09:24.809 --> 01:09:26.372
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:09:26.408 --> 01:09:27.832
No. Thank you.

01:09:27.937 --> 01:09:30.023
Thank you so much, Mr. McKee.

01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:35.236
This course makes you look at writing
in a whole different way.

01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.676
- Mr. McKee.
- Yes?

01:09:38.782 --> 01:09:42.223
I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

01:09:43.682 --> 01:09:45.037
I need more.

01:09:45.142 --> 01:09:48.792
I'm the one who thought
things didn't happen in life.

01:09:50.147 --> 01:09:51.502
Right. Okay.

01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:53.901
- Nice to see you.
- I need to talk.

01:09:55.674 --> 01:09:58.281
Mr. McKee, my even
standing here is very scary.

01:09:58.316 --> 01:09:59.705
I don't meet people well.

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.452
But what you said this morning
shook me to the bone.

01:10:02.556 --> 01:10:04.850
What you said was bigger than
my screenwriting choices.

01:10:04.954 --> 01:10:08.395
It was about my choices
as a human being. Please.

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:12.879
Yeah.

01:10:13.713 --> 01:10:15.346
Well, you know...

01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:18.301
I could sure use a drink, my friend.

01:10:20.595 --> 01:10:24.349
" But a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

01:10:24.384 --> 01:10:26.330
Then what happens?

01:10:28.207 --> 01:10:30.188
Well, that's the end of the book.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:31.961
I wanted to present it simply...

01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:35.089
without big character arcs
or sensationalizing the story.

01:10:35.193 --> 01:10:37.383
I wanted to show flowers
as God's miracles.

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:41.554
I wanted to show that Orlean
never saw the blooming ghost orchid.

01:10:41.589 --> 01:10:43.222
It was about disappointment.

01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:46.872
I see.

01:10:48.227 --> 01:10:49.896
That's not a movie.

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:53.650
You gotta go back, put in the drama.

01:10:54.692 --> 01:11:00.114
I can't go back. I've got pages of
false starts and wrong approaches.

01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:03.347
- I'm way past my deadline.
- I'll tell you a secret.

01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:07.831
A last act makes a film.

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.897
Wow them in the end,
and you got a hit.

01:11:12.002 --> 01:11:15.860
You can have flaws, problems,
but wow them in the end...

01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:18.258
and you've got a hit.

01:11:19.092 --> 01:11:22.707
Find an ending.
But don't cheat.

01:11:22.742 --> 01:11:26.287
And don't you dare bring in
a deus ex machina.

01:11:28.164 --> 01:11:31.084
Your characters must change...

01:11:32.231 --> 01:11:34.942
and the change must come from them.

01:11:37.027 --> 01:11:40.468
Do that and you'll be fine.

01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:43.909
You promise?

01:11:46.412 --> 01:11:48.810
Mr. McKee.

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:54.545
- Have you taken my course before?
- My brother did.

01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:58.194
My twin brother, Donald.
He's the one who got me to come.

01:11:58.229 --> 01:12:00.593
- Twin screenwriters?
- Yeah.

01:12:00.697 --> 01:12:04.764
Well, Julius and Philip Epstein...

01:12:04.799 --> 01:12:07.683
who wrote Casablanca...

01:12:07.788 --> 01:12:10.812
- They were twins
- You mentioned that in class.

01:12:11.646 --> 01:12:13.627
Finest screenplay ever written.

01:12:14.148 --> 01:12:15.817
Great writers' residence.

01:12:15.921 --> 01:12:18.493
- Donald.
- Hey, how's your trip going?

01:12:18.528 --> 01:12:21.343
You getting it on with that
lady journalist, you dog you?

01:12:21.447 --> 01:12:22.594
Yeah.

01:12:23.116 --> 01:12:26.209
Listen, I'm just calling to say
congratulations on your script.

01:12:26.244 --> 01:12:31.249
Isn't that cool? Marty says he can
get me high-sixes against a mil-five.

01:12:33.543 --> 01:12:34.794
That's great, Donald.

01:12:35.003 --> 01:12:37.610
I want to thank you for all your help.

01:12:37.714 --> 01:12:39.347
I wasn't any help.

01:12:39.382 --> 01:12:42.197
Come on,
you let me stay in your place.

01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:45.013
And your integrity
inspired me to even try.

01:12:45.951 --> 01:12:47.828
It's been a wild ride.

01:12:47.933 --> 01:12:50.018
Catherine says
she wants to play Cassie.

01:12:50.122 --> 01:12:51.999
Oh, please!

01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.189
Please, Donald?

01:12:54.398 --> 01:12:55.857
Catherine Keener?

01:12:56.796 --> 01:12:59.820
- Catherine Keener's in my house?
- Yeah, we're playing Boggle.

01:12:59.855 --> 01:13:02.844
She's so great. You should really
hang out with her, Charles.

01:13:03.365 --> 01:13:05.555
Yeah. Look...

01:13:06.598 --> 01:13:08.579
I've been thinking.

01:13:11.707 --> 01:13:16.086
Maybe you'd be interested in hanging
out with me for a few days in New York.

01:13:16.121 --> 01:13:18.172
Oh, my God, yes.

01:13:18.276 --> 01:13:19.423
Yeah?

01:13:19.527 --> 01:13:21.891
I was gonna show my script
to some people...

01:13:21.926 --> 01:13:25.992
and, well, maybe you could
read it too, you know, if you like.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:28.599
Of course. I'd be flattered.

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:31.832
Okay.

01:13:31.936 --> 01:13:33.813
Thanks, Charles.

01:13:33.917 --> 01:13:35.273
Okay, bye.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.226
So, like, what would you do?

01:13:51.435 --> 01:13:53.520
The script kind of makes fun of me?

01:13:53.625 --> 01:13:57.066
- I'm sorry. I was trying something-
- Hey, I don't mind. It's funny.

01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:58.421
Good. Okay.

01:13:59.047 --> 01:14:01.132
So, what would you do?

01:14:02.696 --> 01:14:06.242
You and me are so different, Charles.
We're different talents.

01:14:06.277 --> 01:14:07.701
I know. Just for fun...

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.204
how would the great Donald
end this script?

01:14:10.308 --> 01:14:13.332
Shut up. "The great Donald."

01:14:15.313 --> 01:14:17.295
I feel like you're missing something.

01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:20.944
- All right. Like what?
- Look.

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:26.992
I did a little research on the airplane.

01:14:28.973 --> 01:14:32.414
"Sometimes this kind of story turns out
to be something more..."

01:14:32.449 --> 01:14:34.882
some glimpse of life that expands...

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:37.801
like those Japanese paper balls
you drop in water...

01:14:37.836 --> 01:14:41.381
and they bloom into flowers
and the flower is so marvelous...

01:14:41.416 --> 01:14:44.927
you can't believe there was a time
all you saw in front of you...

01:14:44.962 --> 01:14:46.908
"...was a paper ball and a glass of water."

01:14:47.117 --> 01:14:50.975
Well, first of all, that's inconsistent.
She said she didn't care about flowers.

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:54.416
- For God's sake, it's just a metaphor.
- Well, but for what?

01:14:54.729 --> 01:14:58.587
What turned that paper ball into
a flower? It's not in the book, Charles.

01:14:58.622 --> 01:15:01.089
- I don't know. You're reaching.
- Maybe.

01:15:01.193 --> 01:15:05.677
But I think you actually need to speak
to this woman. To know her.

01:15:07.033 --> 01:15:08.701
I can't.

01:15:10.265 --> 01:15:12.351
- Really.
- I'll go.

01:15:12.559 --> 01:15:14.332
I'll pretend I'm you.

01:15:14.749 --> 01:15:16.209
I want to do it, Charles.

01:15:16.313 --> 01:15:20.171
We'll get to the bottom of this.
We're gonna fix your movie, bro.

01:15:23.091 --> 01:15:25.385
But you've gotta be exactly me.

01:15:25.906 --> 01:15:28.096
I have a reputation to maintain.

01:15:28.722 --> 01:15:30.911
You can't be a goofball.
You can't be an asshole.

01:15:31.016 --> 01:15:32.997
- I'm not an asshole.
- You know what I mean.

01:15:33.205 --> 01:15:36.072
No flirting. No bad jokes.

01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:38.905
Don't laugh how you laugh.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:43.215
I'm not gonna laugh.
I get to have people think I'm you.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:44.780
It's an honor.

01:15:48.638 --> 01:15:51.349
So I guess I'll bring out
the big guns now.

01:15:52.496 --> 01:15:54.268
Do you keep in touch with Laroche?

01:15:55.415 --> 01:16:01.776
I felt I detected an attraction to him
in the subtext. Care to comment?

01:16:04.696 --> 01:16:07.789
Well, our relationship
was strictly reporter-subject.

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:14.393
I mean, certainly an intimacy does
evolve in this kind of relationship.

01:16:14.428 --> 01:16:18.981
By definition, I was so interested
in everything he had to say.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.256
But the relationship ends
when the book ends.

01:16:27.636 --> 01:16:29.930
- Mendacious deceit.
- What?

01:16:30.034 --> 01:16:31.390
Nothing.

01:16:31.911 --> 01:16:33.684
I just have one more question.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:40.983
If you could have dinner with one
historical personage, living or dead...

01:16:41.087 --> 01:16:42.651
who would it be?

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:46.092
Well, I would have to say...

01:16:46.613 --> 01:16:49.325
Einstein.

01:16:50.367 --> 01:16:51.723
Or Jesus.

01:16:53.183 --> 01:16:55.025
Very good.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.624
Interesting answer.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.463
- She's lying.
- What do you mean?

01:17:02.567 --> 01:17:05.487
- What happened?
- Nothing. She said everything right.

01:17:06.738 --> 01:17:10.388
- Too right.
- Well, maybe because they're true.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:11.952
Did you embarrass me?

01:17:12.056 --> 01:17:14.246
People who answer questions
too right are liars.

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:17.791
And everybody says Jesus and Einstein.
That's a prepackaged answer.

01:17:18.312 --> 01:17:21.232
- "Jesus and Einstein"?
- Listen, Charles, I have an idea.

01:17:21.267 --> 01:17:23.422
You'll need to buy me
a pair of binoculars.

01:17:23.457 --> 01:17:25.090
What's "Jesus and Einstein"?

01:17:27.488 --> 01:17:28.844
Come on.

01:17:31.555 --> 01:17:32.806
Sing with me.

01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:40.001
What the hell
do you need binoculars for?

01:17:41.878 --> 01:17:43.859
Let's go, let's go.

01:17:44.902 --> 01:17:47.300
She hung up the phone.
She's upset.

01:17:47.335 --> 01:17:49.699
Stop watching her.
Leave her alone.

01:17:49.803 --> 01:17:51.680
She's crying.

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:55.434
She's at her computer.

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:57.519
This is morally reprehensible.

01:17:57.554 --> 01:17:59.396
United...

01:17:59.917 --> 01:18:01.481
to Miami.

01:18:02.837 --> 01:18:04.401
Eleven...

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:07.321
Fifty-five A.M. tomorrow.

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:11.179
- I thought she was done with Laroche.
- Her parents live in Florida.

01:18:11.214 --> 01:18:13.890
That was no parent phone call,
my friend.

01:18:13.994 --> 01:18:15.350
Don't say "my friend."

01:18:15.454 --> 01:18:17.227
A guy entering.

01:18:17.644 --> 01:18:18.999
Handsome.

01:18:22.127 --> 01:18:23.483
Must be her husband.

01:18:24.421 --> 01:18:26.820
She's acting weird
with him, though, right?

01:18:27.341 --> 01:18:28.801
Don't you think?

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:35.162
What's she hiding from him?

01:18:37.768 --> 01:18:40.271
Maybe she's a lesbian
and doesn't know how to tell him.

01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:41.731
What do you think?

01:18:43.295 --> 01:18:45.172
Have you checked out
Laroche's porn site?

01:18:45.207 --> 01:18:47.222
No. I'm trying to read.

01:18:47.257 --> 01:18:49.447
Anyway, I'm gonna look
at the porn site.

01:18:49.482 --> 01:18:51.324
Research.

01:18:52.158 --> 01:18:54.035
- Don't tell my old lady.
- You mean Mom?

01:18:54.139 --> 01:18:55.808
No, I don't mean Mom.

01:18:58.206 --> 01:19:00.187
I still say we should go
to Miami tomorrow.

01:19:00.222 --> 01:19:01.334
Forget it.

01:19:01.438 --> 01:19:03.697
Some of these chicks look okay.

01:19:03.732 --> 01:19:06.026
Hey, guess what.
We're going to Miami tomorrow.

01:19:06.131 --> 01:19:10.093
- I said, no.
- I said, oh, yeah, baby. Come here.

01:19:29.175 --> 01:19:34.597
What I came to understand
is that change is not a choice.

01:19:34.632 --> 01:19:38.768
Not for a species of plant,
and not for me.

01:19:38.803 --> 01:19:42.835
It happens, and you are different.

01:19:44.295 --> 01:19:47.214
Maybe the only distinction
between the plant and me...

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:49.821
is that afterward,
I lied about my change.

01:19:49.925 --> 01:19:53.575
I lied in my book.
I pretended with my husband...

01:19:53.679 --> 01:19:56.494
that everything was the same.

01:19:56.599 --> 01:20:00.248
But something happened
in the swamp that day.

01:20:03.272 --> 01:20:04.628
Hey, look.

01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:08.173
I told you I'd find
the jewel of the Fakahatchee.

01:20:14.221 --> 01:20:15.785
It's a flower.

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.122
Just a flower.

01:20:20.477 --> 01:20:22.563
Well, might as well grab it.

01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:24.544
Long as I'm here.

01:20:33.407 --> 01:20:34.554
Oh, man.

01:20:43.626 --> 01:20:46.128
Boy, my porn site's gonna be big.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.582
Look, something I didn't tell you...

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:59.267
that I want to tell you about the ghost.
Okay?

01:21:00.831 --> 01:21:02.708
I think it might help you.

01:21:05.419 --> 01:21:07.191
I'd just started at the nursery.

01:21:08.338 --> 01:21:11.154
And I went back one night
to pick up something.

01:21:30.444 --> 01:21:33.573
They wanted the ghost
just to extract the drug.

01:21:34.198 --> 01:21:36.075
It had been a ceremonial thing...

01:21:36.179 --> 01:21:39.099
but the young guys, you know,
they liked to get stoned.

01:21:39.203 --> 01:21:40.663
So Matthew...?

01:21:41.184 --> 01:21:42.957
- He was one of the guys who-?
- Sure.

01:21:43.061 --> 01:21:45.946
Matthew lived on that shit
till they ran out.

01:21:45.981 --> 01:21:50.152
Because there was this one day
he was fascinated by me.

01:21:50.187 --> 01:21:54.705
By my hair and my sadness.

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:57.764
Yeah, well, it does that.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:21:57.868 --> 01:22:03.707
I mean, I think you'd like it, Susie.
It seems to help people be fascinated.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.731
You know, I can extract it for you.
I know how. I watched.

01:22:06.836 --> 01:22:09.651
I'm probably the only white guy
who knows.

01:22:10.902 --> 01:22:12.466
I want to do this, Susie.

01:22:15.907 --> 01:22:18.201
I'm done with orchids, Laroche.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.037
- Hello?
- Hi.

01:23:42.141 --> 01:23:43.705
It's John.

01:23:43.809 --> 01:23:46.208
Did you get my package?

01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:47.876
John?

01:23:48.919 --> 01:23:50.483
John!

01:23:51.943 --> 01:23:53.194
Johnny.

01:23:55.175 --> 01:23:57.365
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

01:24:03.308 --> 01:24:05.185
Very happy now.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.271
Well, I'm glad.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:11.650
Very happy.

01:24:16.864 --> 01:24:18.532
Will you go like this-?

01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:30.941
No. Keep going.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.866
No. No.

01:24:42.307 --> 01:24:45.643
I'm trying to make a dial tone.
And you have to sustain.

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:48.354
And then I will join you, and together...

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:51.795
- See, I can't do it by myself.
- Which one do you want me to do?

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:56.279
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Okay. Here we go.

01:25:05.247 --> 01:25:07.089
- That's it.
- We got it.

01:25:07.124 --> 01:25:10.773
We got it. That's fucking amazing.

01:25:13.276 --> 01:25:16.195
Do you ever get
lonely sometimes, Johnny?

01:25:17.447 --> 01:25:19.636
Well, I was a weird kid.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.973
Nobody liked me.

01:25:24.433 --> 01:25:26.727
But I had this idea...

01:25:28.604 --> 01:25:31.315
if I waited long
enough, someone would...

01:25:32.358 --> 01:25:34.652
come around and just...

01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:39.031
you know, understand me.

01:25:44.662 --> 01:25:46.643
Like my mom.

01:25:50.084 --> 01:25:52.274
Except someone else.

01:25:53.942 --> 01:26:00.094
She'd look at me and quietly say.:

01:26:00.928 --> 01:26:02.180
"Yes."

01:26:04.265 --> 01:26:06.351
Just like that.

01:26:07.706 --> 01:26:11.460
And I wouldn't be alone anymore.

01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:28.769
I wish I were an ant.

01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:32.732
They're so shiny.

01:26:35.651 --> 01:26:37.841
You're shinier than any ant, darling.

01:26:39.614 --> 01:26:43.576
That's the sweetest thing
anybody has ever said to me.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.932
Well...

01:26:45.453 --> 01:26:47.434
I like you, that's why.

01:26:55.046 --> 01:26:56.297
Hey.

01:27:36.859 --> 01:27:39.153
I don't have time for that.

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:55.003
I'll get a closer look. You wait here.

01:28:02.302 --> 01:28:04.179
No, wait!

01:28:06.473 --> 01:28:07.933
I should go.

01:28:08.246 --> 01:28:11.061
I mean, it should be me, right?

01:28:11.096 --> 01:28:12.417
I mean...

01:28:12.938 --> 01:28:14.293
it's my...

01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:17.317
- I was, you know-
- Go for it, bro.

01:28:17.352 --> 01:28:19.299
You're the man.

01:29:22.488 --> 01:29:23.948
Rip them.

01:29:24.678 --> 01:29:26.137
Just rip them.

01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:51.372
Darling, I don't know
what's come over you.

01:29:51.684 --> 01:29:56.794
You came all over me last time
I was here, as I recall.

01:30:22.758 --> 01:30:25.365
Goddamn!

01:30:25.469 --> 01:30:27.033
Hey! Fuck.

01:30:28.284 --> 01:30:29.605
Get in here!

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.768
Shut the fuck up, now!
Sit the fuck down!

01:30:33.081 --> 01:30:35.375
- Who is that, Johnny?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:30:35.479 --> 01:30:37.252
I just-Nobody.

01:30:37.356 --> 01:30:41.214
- I just-I'm just-
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:30:42.361 --> 01:30:44.238
He's that screenwriter.

01:30:45.385 --> 01:30:49.034
- The guy that's adapting our book?
- Yeah.

01:30:52.058 --> 01:30:53.883
Well, that's wild.

01:30:53.918 --> 01:30:55.708
It's nice to meet you.

01:30:57.898 --> 01:30:59.670
Hey, dude...

01:30:59.879 --> 01:31:04.050
- Who's gonna play me?
- I don't know that. I should...

01:31:04.085 --> 01:31:06.240
Well, I thought I should play me.

01:31:06.344 --> 01:31:07.595
Why-?

01:31:07.699 --> 01:31:10.515
- Did he follow me?
- No, of course not. I should go.

01:31:10.619 --> 01:31:13.956
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
it was nice to meet you...

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.250
but let me give you my number.

01:31:16.354 --> 01:31:19.691
I'm really freaking here, Johnny.
Why is he here?

01:31:20.004 --> 01:31:21.672
Why did he follow me?

01:31:22.089 --> 01:31:25.321
- What does he know?
- I don't know anything about anything.

01:31:25.426 --> 01:31:28.033
- He did see the greenhouse.
- Oh, shit.

01:31:28.068 --> 01:31:29.492
Oh, shit.

01:31:29.909 --> 01:31:32.412
Are you gonna write about this
in your screenplay?

01:31:32.447 --> 01:31:34.602
I really don't know what "this" is.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.773
He's lying.

01:31:39.503 --> 01:31:41.484
- Hold him.
- Stay! Just...

01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:19.300
We have to kill him.

01:32:19.335 --> 01:32:21.159
- What?
- What are we supposed to do?

01:32:21.194 --> 01:32:22.984
- What can we do?
- Sit the fuck down!

01:32:29.971 --> 01:32:31.535
Susie...

01:32:31.848 --> 01:32:33.794
you gotta calm down.

01:32:33.829 --> 01:32:36.227
Now, you're getting a little emotional.

01:32:36.331 --> 01:32:38.938
- You don't know-
- I can't have him writing about me.

01:32:39.042 --> 01:32:43.526
I can't have the whole world,
all the people knowing about us...

01:32:43.561 --> 01:32:45.507
and about this.

01:32:47.384 --> 01:32:48.948
Why?

01:32:49.678 --> 01:32:51.972
- You ashamed of me, Susie?
- No, that's not it.

01:32:52.077 --> 01:32:54.266
- No. How can you even think of that?
- Well...

01:32:54.475 --> 01:32:57.812
I'm a professional journalist,
and the drugs and...

01:33:00.418 --> 01:33:02.400
We can't kill anyone.

01:33:02.435 --> 01:33:04.485
Okay. Okay.

01:33:04.589 --> 01:33:06.675
Then I'll do it.

01:33:06.988 --> 01:33:08.552
By myself.

01:33:08.656 --> 01:33:11.228
- Susan-
- Hey! Come on. Fucking get down!

01:33:11.263 --> 01:33:13.974
- I wouldn't tell any-
- Put him in his fucking car!

01:33:59.645 --> 01:34:02.565
Turn it off. Just get out.

01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:34.055
Run! Run! Go!

01:34:35.724 --> 01:34:37.983
Susan! What the fuck was that?

01:34:38.018 --> 01:34:43.649
- I don't know. I couldn't see.
- Shit. Fuck!

01:34:43.684 --> 01:34:46.255
Come on! Help me find the flashlight.

01:35:15.765 --> 01:35:18.371
So it was a guy?

01:35:18.406 --> 01:35:21.986
Yeah. Fat.

01:35:22.021 --> 01:35:24.628
That's all I could tell.

01:35:30.363 --> 01:35:32.935
This is ridiculous.
We're gonna have to split up.

01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:38.496
I can't. I can't be by myself out here.
I'm not gonna do that.

01:35:40.477 --> 01:35:43.606
- They're gonna find us.
- I don't think so.

01:35:43.918 --> 01:35:47.776
I don't want to die, Donald.
I've wasted my life. God, I've wasted it.

01:35:47.811 --> 01:35:51.739
- You did not. And you're not gonna die.
- I wasted it.

01:35:51.843 --> 01:35:53.824
I admire you, Donald, you know?

01:35:53.929 --> 01:35:57.682
I spent my whole life paralyzed,
worrying about what people think of me...

01:35:57.717 --> 01:36:01.958
- And you, you're just oblivious.
- I'm not oblivious.

01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:06.233
No, you don't understand.
I mean that as a compliment.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.238
There was this time in high school.

01:36:11.342 --> 01:36:14.435
I was watching you out
the library window...

01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:18.328
- ...you were talking to Sarah Marsh.
- Oh, God, I was so in love with her.

01:36:18.433 --> 01:36:23.751
I know. And you were flirting with her,
and she was being really sweet to you.

01:36:23.786 --> 01:36:27.713
- I remember that.
- And then, when you walked away...

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.363
she started making fun of you
with Kim Canetti.

01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:36.889
And it was like
they were laughing at me.

01:36:38.557 --> 01:36:40.851
You didn't know at all?

01:36:42.207 --> 01:36:46.795
- You seemed so happy.
- I knew. I heard them.

01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:49.923
Well, how come you were so happy?

01:36:51.696 --> 01:36:54.407
I loved Sarah, Charles.

01:36:55.867 --> 01:37:00.976
It was mine, that love.

01:37:02.436 --> 01:37:04.521
I owned it.

01:37:07.232 --> 01:37:11.091
Even Sarah didn't have
the right to take it away.

01:37:12.759 --> 01:37:15.679
I can love whoever I want.

01:37:17.973 --> 01:37:20.684
But she thought you were pathetic.

01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:27.670
That was her business, not mine.

01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:35.803
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

01:37:37.889 --> 01:37:41.225
That's what I decided a long time ago.

01:37:54.364 --> 01:37:56.345
What's up?

01:37:58.222 --> 01:38:00.307
Thank you.

01:38:01.454 --> 01:38:03.748
For what?

01:38:13.029 --> 01:38:15.323
No, shh!

01:38:15.531 --> 01:38:18.347
Listen. I hear them.

01:38:18.451 --> 01:38:21.892
I hear them. I hear them breathing.

01:38:27.418 --> 01:38:29.921
Charlie?

01:38:30.964 --> 01:38:33.779
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

01:38:33.814 --> 01:38:36.490
- Guys?
- Charlie!

01:38:36.594 --> 01:38:38.367
Charlie!

01:39:11.630 --> 01:39:13.611
Where's the van?

01:39:14.654 --> 01:39:19.659
- Are they gone?
- I don't know. Maybe.

01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:49.898
John? John!

01:39:58.449 --> 01:39:59.908
Shit!

01:40:20.972 --> 01:40:23.891
I can't believe I got shot.
Isn't that fucked up?

01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:26.185
Shut up. Stop laughing.

01:40:54.339 --> 01:40:58.718
Donald? You're gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Donald.

01:40:59.031 --> 01:41:03.515
Just don't go to sleep. Just don't
go to sleep, Donald. Look at me.

01:41:03.828 --> 01:41:06.295
Look at me, Donald.
Keep looking at me.

01:41:06.330 --> 01:41:09.823
Open your eyes.
Donald, please open your eyes.

01:41:09.858 --> 01:41:13.317
Donald. Donald, please
open your eyes, Donald.

01:41:13.421 --> 01:41:16.445
Donald! Donald, open your eyes!

01:41:38.133 --> 01:41:39.802
Look at me.

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:55.339
Help!

01:42:04.723 --> 01:42:06.183
John!

01:42:37.465 --> 01:42:39.029
Halt!

01:43:08.955 --> 01:43:11.319
I'm sorry.

01:43:11.354 --> 01:43:14.065
Now I have to do this too.

01:43:14.899 --> 01:43:17.297
I'm not a killer.

01:43:19.278 --> 01:43:20.530
You put yourself in...

01:43:25.847 --> 01:43:27.307
Johnny!

01:43:30.123 --> 01:43:32.104
- Help!
- No, no!

01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:39.507
Johnny! Johnny! John!

01:43:52.854 --> 01:43:55.044
Oh, no, no, no.

01:44:05.054 --> 01:44:09.642
Oh, God. You fat piece of shit!

01:44:10.893 --> 01:44:13.709
- He's dead, you loser!
- Shut up!

01:44:13.813 --> 01:44:16.628
- You ruined my life, you fat fuck!
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:44:16.733 --> 01:44:22.885
Fuck you, lady! You're just a lonely,
old, desperate, pathetic drug addict!

01:44:33.312 --> 01:44:36.544
Oh, my God.

01:44:38.526 --> 01:44:43.844
It's over. Everything's over.

01:44:44.052 --> 01:44:46.450
I did everything wrong.

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:52.498
I want my life back.

01:44:52.603 --> 01:44:57.191
I want it back before it all got fucked up.

01:44:57.226 --> 01:45:01.779
I want to be a baby again.
I want to be new.

01:45:01.987 --> 01:45:05.115
I want to be new.

01:45:37.127 --> 01:45:39.213
Hello?

01:45:41.715 --> 01:45:44.322
- Hello?
- Mom.

01:45:44.426 --> 01:45:49.327
Charles? Charles, is that you?

01:45:53.811 --> 01:45:56.939
Charles, what's the matter? You okay?

01:46:18.315 --> 01:46:22.799
Donald says,
"That was her business, not mine."

01:46:22.834 --> 01:46:26.657
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:30.098
"I decided that a long time ago."

01:46:30.515 --> 01:46:33.122
Kaufman starts to cry.

01:46:33.226 --> 01:46:38.127
He tries to thank his brother,
but he can't put it into words.

01:46:39.899 --> 01:46:43.966
- So how you getting on?
- I'm okay.

01:46:47.198 --> 01:46:48.658
I miss him, you know?

01:46:51.057 --> 01:46:54.289
- How's the script coming?
- It's good. I'm almost finished.

01:46:54.393 --> 01:46:57.000
I'll be really glad to move on
to something else.

01:46:57.104 --> 01:46:58.773
I'll bet.

01:47:00.337 --> 01:47:02.110
Things okay with you?

01:47:02.214 --> 01:47:07.010
And then in January, David and I went
to Prague. That was a high point.

01:47:07.045 --> 01:47:10.243
- That sounds great.
- There's amazing puppet theater there.

01:47:10.347 --> 01:47:12.224
Yeah, I've heard. I've gotta see that.

01:47:12.328 --> 01:47:18.689
And there's this church decorated
with, like, human skulls and bones.

01:47:18.724 --> 01:47:22.338
Forty thousand skulls and bones.

01:47:23.068 --> 01:47:25.467
I thought about you when I went there.

01:47:47.781 --> 01:47:51.326
Charlie, I'm with someone.
Why are you doing this now?

01:47:54.872 --> 01:47:56.957
I love you.

01:48:03.213 --> 01:48:07.141
I should go. I have to...

01:48:07.176 --> 01:48:11.347
Stuff I have to do.
I'm going away this weekend...

01:48:11.382 --> 01:48:15.309
- Million things, okay?
- Yeah.

01:48:29.282 --> 01:48:31.889
I love you too, you know.

01:48:51.909 --> 01:48:55.193
I have to go right home.
I know how to finish the script now.

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:58.478
It ends with Kaufman driving home
after his lunch with Amelia...

01:48:58.582 --> 01:49:01.293
thinking he knows
how to finish the script.

01:49:01.398 --> 01:49:04.422
Shit, that's voice-over.
McKee would not approve.

01:49:04.526 --> 01:49:07.758
How else can I show his thoughts?
I don't know.

01:49:07.793 --> 01:49:10.991
Well, who cares what McKee says?
It feels right.

01:49:11.095 --> 01:49:13.076
Conclusive.

01:49:13.181 --> 01:49:16.899
I wonder who's gonna play me.
Someone not too fat.

01:49:16.934 --> 01:49:20.480
I like that Gerard Depardieu,
but can he not do the accent?

01:49:20.515 --> 01:49:24.928
Anyway, it's done.
And that's something.

01:49:24.963 --> 01:49:29.864
So.: "Kaufman drives off from
his encounter with Amelia..."

01:49:29.899 --> 01:49:33.201
filled for the first time with hope."

01:49:34.035 --> 01:49:36.121
I like this.

01:49:36.642 --> 01:49:38.727
