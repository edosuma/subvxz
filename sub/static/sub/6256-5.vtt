00:04.944 --> 00:07.545
I thought I'd start
my speech with a joke.

00:07.580 --> 00:08.177
Right.

00:08.201 --> 00:11.276
Erwin Schrodinger gets pulled
over by the police for speeding.

00:11.584 --> 00:14.385
The officer says,
"What's in the trunk?"

00:14.421 --> 00:17.355
Schrodinger says, "A cat."

00:17.390 --> 00:19.057
The officer says,
"Well, I need to see."

00:19.092 --> 00:20.858
So police officer
opens the trunk,

00:20.894 --> 00:23.895
he says, "This cat is dead."

00:23.930 --> 00:26.364
Schrodinger says,
"Well, it is now."

00:29.369 --> 00:31.235
Give me a heads up
when the joke's coming.

00:31.271 --> 00:33.671
Well, that was a joke, Booth.

00:33.706 --> 00:35.807
It's based on Schrodinger's
famous thought experiment...

00:35.842 --> 00:37.542
Ah, you know what,
I usually judge a joke

00:37.577 --> 00:38.743
by how funny it is.

00:38.778 --> 00:40.478
And there was no yuks
on that one.

00:40.513 --> 00:41.946
Great, now my speech

00:41.981 --> 00:43.614
for the forensic convention
has no beginning.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.016
Try this for a joke.

00:45.051 --> 00:46.751
You hear about the, uh,
restaurant on the moon?

00:46.786 --> 00:48.920
Great food but no atmosphere.
(chuckles)

00:48.955 --> 00:51.355
That's not a science joke.

00:51.391 --> 00:53.391
Yes, it is--
it's got the word "moon."

00:53.426 --> 00:54.725
It's got the word "atmosphere."

00:54.761 --> 00:56.394
That's very "sciencery." Here.

00:56.429 --> 00:58.362
(sighs)
I-I'm not hungry.

00:58.398 --> 01:01.032
Wow, you really are nervous
about all this.

01:01.067 --> 01:03.768
It's the National Forensic
Sciences Convention.

01:03.803 --> 01:06.537
Being chosen as the keynote
speaker is a great honor

01:06.573 --> 01:08.506
and a terrible responsibility.

01:08.541 --> 01:09.674
No jokes.

01:09.709 --> 01:11.476
Jokes-- out the door.

01:11.511 --> 01:14.612
You are the smartest...

01:14.647 --> 01:16.247
person in that room.

01:16.282 --> 01:17.949
They're gonna love you.

01:17.984 --> 01:20.318
Hmm?

01:20.353 --> 01:22.053
Eat up.

01:22.088 --> 01:23.888
What?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074

01:34.167 --> 01:37.468
SAROYAN:
Wow, this is amazing.

01:37.504 --> 01:40.004
Look at all this stuff.

01:40.039 --> 01:41.706
MAN:
Wow, it's Dr. Brennan.

01:41.741 --> 01:43.221
WOMAN:
Ooh, they're here! Dr. Brennan!

01:45.311 --> 01:46.577
Amanda Gurtz.

01:46.613 --> 01:48.246
I'd be a very good intern,
Dr. Saroyan.

01:48.281 --> 01:50.248
I've worked closely
with anomalies

01:50.283 --> 01:52.583
in gap junction-competent cells
and micronucleus formation...

01:52.619 --> 01:54.485
Thank you, I will
take a look at it.

01:54.521 --> 01:56.053
Okay.

02:01.127 --> 02:02.860
I'm Dr. Howard Fitch.

02:02.896 --> 02:05.696
I've developed a combustible
gas detector and also...

02:05.732 --> 02:07.965
Thank you
for your card.

02:08.001 --> 02:09.300
Gosh, this is crazy.

02:09.335 --> 02:11.602
It's like walking
into a show with my dad.

02:11.638 --> 02:13.171
Ms. Montenegro?

02:13.206 --> 02:16.274
You are the most brilliant
person at the Jeffersonian.

02:16.309 --> 02:19.243
Your steganographic decryption
and stochastic deduction...

02:19.279 --> 02:21.913
So sorry, we're actually
in a rush, so...

02:21.948 --> 02:23.114
Oh, no, no.
Don't be rude.

02:23.149 --> 02:24.348
Let her, let her
finish, Hodgins.

02:24.384 --> 02:25.316
Oh.

02:25.351 --> 02:26.417
You were saying?

02:26.452 --> 02:27.985
I just think
you're amazing.

02:29.389 --> 02:30.488
This is amazing, huh?

02:30.523 --> 02:32.089
Awesome.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.525
It's a pleasure to see
you again, Dr. Hodgins.

02:34.561 --> 02:36.928
I have been following
your illustrious career.

02:36.963 --> 02:38.262
(sighs)
Wow.

02:38.298 --> 02:39.797
I thought the security here
was tight.

02:39.832 --> 02:41.265
I guess not.

02:41.301 --> 02:43.367
Well, we are colleagues now,
I thought you'd...

02:43.403 --> 02:45.670
Colleagues? Excuse me.

02:45.705 --> 02:48.272
You are an incompetent
forensic entomologist

02:48.308 --> 02:49.507
and a disgrace
to your profession.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.576
I'm Dr. Camille Saroyan.

02:51.611 --> 02:52.543
I work with...

02:52.579 --> 02:53.911
Yes, I know who you are.

02:53.947 --> 02:55.446
Dr. Leona Saunders.
Dr. Hodgins and I...

02:55.481 --> 02:57.949
Have nothing more to say
to each other. Excuse me.

02:57.984 --> 03:01.185
Cam, I think the smart glasses
you want to see are over here.

03:01.221 --> 03:02.386
What was that?

03:02.422 --> 03:04.622
Nothing, that was
ancient history.

03:08.027 --> 03:09.860
MONTENEGRO: These record
everything at the crime scene

03:09.896 --> 03:12.797
so you can revisit the footage
whenever you want.

03:12.832 --> 03:15.299
A useful device
for people with no memory

03:15.335 --> 03:17.802
or powers of observation.

03:21.908 --> 03:24.609
Hey. You okay?

03:24.644 --> 03:26.577
Yeah. You know what, I got
to go deal with something, okay?

03:26.613 --> 03:27.545
I'm gonna catch you later.

03:27.580 --> 03:28.980
Excuse me.
Yeah.

03:30.550 --> 03:32.683
What, what are
you doing here?

03:32.719 --> 03:36.187
SAROYAN: Have you heard
of a Dr. Saunders?

03:36.222 --> 03:37.755
Uh, no.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.624
Old feud, apparently.

03:39.659 --> 03:41.959
WOMAN: Speaking of old feuds,
Dr. Brennan.

03:41.995 --> 03:43.194
Oh...

03:43.229 --> 03:44.395
Tess Brown.

03:44.430 --> 03:46.364
Tess is a forensic novelist

03:46.399 --> 03:50.034
who has no comprehension
of forensics.

03:50.069 --> 03:52.036
We know who Tess Brown is,
sweetie.

03:52.071 --> 03:53.537
What are you
doing here?

03:53.573 --> 03:55.573
I'm researching a new book.

03:55.608 --> 03:57.308
A novel approach.

03:57.343 --> 03:59.277
You never researched any
of your other books.

03:59.312 --> 04:01.912
Touché. My days of being
a sloppy writer are over.

04:01.948 --> 04:03.681
And I'd like
to make amends with you

04:03.716 --> 04:06.217
and possibly even
become friends.

04:06.252 --> 04:07.518
By all means, do your research.

04:07.553 --> 04:09.353
But I could never
be friends with someone

04:09.389 --> 04:11.222
who publicly displays such
contempt for their readers.

04:11.257 --> 04:12.823
MAN:
Dr. Brennan.

04:12.859 --> 04:15.493
I'm Aldus Carter.
It is an honor to meet you.

04:15.528 --> 04:18.362
Would you like a sample of my
non-stick examination gloves?

04:18.398 --> 04:19.730
Thank you.

04:19.766 --> 04:22.366
They're very practical
at a crime scene.

04:22.402 --> 04:23.601
These are great.

04:23.636 --> 04:25.036
Take the whole box of gloves,
please.

04:25.071 --> 04:27.371
Thank you.

04:27.407 --> 04:29.907
Dr. Brennan, you are
looking lovely today.

04:29.942 --> 04:31.909
I-I thought so, myself,
Dr. Harkness.

04:31.944 --> 04:32.977
Is it time?

04:33.012 --> 04:34.879
Hello, Edward.

04:34.914 --> 04:37.548
Tess.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.151
Well, I would like to introduce
you to the other board members

04:40.186 --> 04:42.253
before we get underway
if that's okay.

04:42.288 --> 04:43.421
Of course.

04:43.456 --> 04:45.623
Please.

04:45.658 --> 04:47.658
Does everyone in this place
hate each other?

04:47.694 --> 04:49.794
You and I are fine, aren't we?

04:57.003 --> 04:58.169
Sorry.

04:58.204 --> 05:00.071
Hey, you've
been gone forever.

05:00.106 --> 05:01.106
Is everything okay?

05:01.140 --> 05:02.140
Yeah, totally.

05:02.141 --> 05:03.074
Never better.

05:03.109 --> 05:04.141
Hello, everyone!

05:06.012 --> 05:08.012
Thank you.

05:10.883 --> 05:12.416
I am Dr. Edward Harkness,

05:12.452 --> 05:15.519
director of the National
Forensic Sciences Convention.

05:15.555 --> 05:17.455
And it gives me great pleasure

05:17.490 --> 05:19.857
to introduce our
keynote speaker.

05:19.892 --> 05:22.193
A woman who,
like a fine Cabernet

05:22.228 --> 05:24.195
that combines
phenolic compounds,

05:24.230 --> 05:25.796
anthocyanins and colloids
to produce perfection...

05:25.832 --> 05:27.631
I hate wine geeks.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.401
HARKNESS:
...which makes her, some say,

05:30.436 --> 05:32.536
the greatest
forensic anthropologist

05:32.572 --> 05:33.604
in the last 50 years.

05:33.639 --> 05:35.272
Please give a
warm welcome

05:35.308 --> 05:37.675
to the incomparable
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

05:37.710 --> 05:40.478
(applause, whooping)

05:45.985 --> 05:46.985
Thank you, Dr. Harkness.

05:47.019 --> 05:48.019
MAN:
Yeah!

05:48.054 --> 05:49.520
Good afternoon,

05:49.555 --> 05:51.455
ladies and gentlemen.

05:51.491 --> 05:54.158
I am quite excited to be
in a room full of people

05:54.193 --> 05:57.128
familiar with the legends
of the science world.

05:57.163 --> 06:01.866
People like the great physicist
Dr. Erwin Schrodinger.

06:01.901 --> 06:04.201
Imagine, if you will,

06:04.237 --> 06:05.803
Dr. Schrodinger
driving to work...

06:05.838 --> 06:07.838
(fire alarm sounds)

06:10.143 --> 06:12.676
Please, everyone, move,
move to the exits.

06:12.712 --> 06:16.180
Oh, my God,
the place is on fire!

06:16.215 --> 06:18.749
HARKNESS: To the exits,
everyone. Thank you.

06:22.388 --> 06:24.622
There's a body
in there.

06:24.657 --> 06:26.557
And it's burning!

06:28.094 --> 06:31.429
(coughing)

06:31.464 --> 06:32.596
What, do you smell that?

06:32.632 --> 06:33.864
Ugh, that is gasoline.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.166
BRENNAN:
The fire is still localized.

06:35.201 --> 06:37.601
This extinguisher should
contain it.

06:40.873 --> 06:43.340
This makes no sense. Why isn't
it putting out the fire?

06:43.376 --> 06:44.842
Okay, this isn't the time for
a science lesson, let's just go.

06:44.877 --> 06:46.243
We need to get out of here
while we still can.

06:46.279 --> 06:48.746
The evidence is burning.
Now, Dr. Brennan!

07:40.472 --> 07:43.166

Dr. Saroyan!

08:03.988 --> 08:05.621
I have an arson scene tool kit
and some debris sifters that...

08:05.656 --> 08:07.022
Stop. Stop,
all right, everybody?

08:07.058 --> 08:08.290
Just keep it down
out here, all right?

08:08.326 --> 08:10.859
I'd like a headlamp.
Yeah, me, too.

08:10.895 --> 08:13.262
Yeah, lamps for everyone.

08:13.297 --> 08:14.630
Who's got the L.E.D. lamps?

08:14.665 --> 08:16.498
Here! I got four.

08:16.534 --> 08:18.801
Cool. Thank you.
Thank you.

08:21.005 --> 08:22.504
For you.
Thank you.

08:25.076 --> 08:28.143
What is this white crust?

08:29.714 --> 08:31.080
Where's my lamp?

08:31.115 --> 08:33.148
Fire department used
a class "D" extinguisher

08:33.183 --> 08:34.750
to put out the fire

08:34.784 --> 08:37.986
and left a sodium chloride shell
all over the remains.

08:38.022 --> 08:39.188
You don't see that every day.

08:39.222 --> 08:40.356
Class "D," that's a metal fire.

08:40.390 --> 08:42.091
That's right, yeah.

08:42.126 --> 08:45.628
Most likely alkaline-based like,
uh, magnesium or titanium,

08:45.663 --> 08:47.696
which burns at even
higher temperatures.

08:47.732 --> 08:49.498
Well, the extreme heat
of the fire explains

08:49.533 --> 08:51.667
why her remains fused
to the concrete floor,

08:51.702 --> 08:54.270
the stairs and part
of the railing.

08:54.305 --> 08:55.304
You already know it's a "her"?

08:55.339 --> 08:57.373
Hey, everybody.
Hey!

08:57.408 --> 08:58.907
Mr. Bray!

08:58.943 --> 09:01.243
Whoa, somebody had a bad day.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.611
The small brow ridges

09:02.647 --> 09:04.207
and the sharp upper
margins of the orbit

09:04.215 --> 09:06.181
suggest the victim is a female.

09:06.217 --> 09:07.549
Already noted,
Mr. Bray.

09:07.585 --> 09:08.517
Here, brother.

09:08.552 --> 09:09.485
Thanks.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.819
You allowed
to be here?

09:10.855 --> 09:13.289
He's had no medical cannabis
for a month.

09:13.324 --> 09:15.624
The DOJ and the Jeffersonian
gave him the all clear.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.793
Because I got into the clinical
trial Dr. B. recommended.

09:17.828 --> 09:20.329
You're still in remission?
Yep.

09:20.364 --> 09:22.765
Well, you know,
it's good to have you back.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.967
It's good to be back.

09:25.002 --> 09:27.770
The symphyseal surface
of the pelvis shows a woman

09:27.805 --> 09:29.705
about 40 years old.

09:29.740 --> 09:32.241
I've got a badly burned
lanyard here.

09:32.276 --> 09:34.143
Can't make out an ID.

09:34.178 --> 09:35.978
Here, let me see that.

09:36.013 --> 09:38.947
That is definitely an ID
from this convention.

09:38.983 --> 09:40.683
Okay, hand it over
to me, all right?

09:40.718 --> 09:41.817
I'll get it to Angela

09:41.852 --> 09:43.132
in the, uh, hotel security room.

09:43.154 --> 09:45.020
Maybe she can ID it.

09:45.056 --> 09:46.522
All right, everybody--
listen up, all right?

09:46.557 --> 09:48.190
I know that you're all
forensic super-experts,

09:48.225 --> 09:49.491
but today you have to stay

09:49.527 --> 09:51.593
on the other side
of the yellow tape.

09:51.629 --> 09:53.429
You still like
being a G-man, huh?

09:53.464 --> 09:55.864
I feel like security
at a Beyoncé concert.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.132
What the hell
is she doing?

09:57.168 --> 09:59.034
She's the least
of my worries.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.135
Okay, look,
do me a favor.

10:00.171 --> 10:01.236
Get this to Angela
in security,

10:01.272 --> 10:02.404
see if she can
ID the victim.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.572
I'll take care
of that mess.

10:03.607 --> 10:04.707
All right?
All right.

10:04.742 --> 10:05.874
Let him out.

10:05.910 --> 10:07.643
I'm here researching
my new book,

10:07.678 --> 10:09.211
<i>Hotter than My Heart.</i>

10:09.246 --> 10:11.080
I was in the back
of the ballroom,

10:11.115 --> 10:13.849
listening to the wonderful Dr.
Brennan when the alarm went off.

10:13.884 --> 10:15.451
It was my quick reaction
that saved the corpse

10:15.486 --> 10:16.852
from burning
to a crisp.

10:16.887 --> 10:18.420
Okay, that's it. Break it up.
Let's go.

10:18.456 --> 10:20.089
Go find a Kardashian.
Party's over, all right?

10:20.124 --> 10:21.223
Thank you. Bye-bye.

10:21.258 --> 10:22.991
Do you have any
idea who I am?

10:23.027 --> 10:24.027
Yeah, I do.

10:24.028 --> 10:25.594
My car wash sells your books.

10:25.629 --> 10:27.262
But, you know what, you are not
gonna use this murder

10:27.298 --> 10:28.298
to promote yourself.

10:28.299 --> 10:29.732
Am I hurting someone?

10:29.767 --> 10:31.567
Yes, you are--
someone with a sense of decency.

10:31.602 --> 10:33.435
Now, I have to ask you
a few questions.

10:33.471 --> 10:34.903
Me?

10:34.939 --> 10:36.305
Yes, you.

10:36.340 --> 10:38.107
Now, you were the first
to see the body, right?

10:38.142 --> 10:39.142
Come on.

10:39.143 --> 10:41.176
Come on, let's go.

10:43.814 --> 10:48.384
We have to separate the remains
from the floor and the railing

10:48.419 --> 10:50.419
so we can bring them
back to the lab.

10:50.454 --> 10:52.087
More than half the tissue
has been vaporized

10:52.123 --> 10:53.756
because of the intense
heat of the fire.

10:53.791 --> 10:55.357
Running tox screens
is gonna be difficult.

10:55.393 --> 10:56.393
Here you go.

10:56.394 --> 10:57.626
This should help
us scrape her

10:57.661 --> 10:58.761
off the floor
and the railing.

10:58.796 --> 11:00.429
What is it?

11:00.464 --> 11:03.031
Well, it's a concrete
and metal saw all in one.

11:03.067 --> 11:04.666
Dr. Fitch out there
invented it.

11:06.637 --> 11:08.837
I've got a
biodegradable solution

11:08.873 --> 11:10.806
that might loosen the tissue

11:10.841 --> 11:12.040
fused to the floor!

11:12.076 --> 11:13.342
FITCH:
"Might"!

11:13.377 --> 11:14.676
It also "might"
destroy evidence!

11:14.712 --> 11:15.944
And your saw

11:15.980 --> 11:18.881
won't damage tissue
and bone?

11:18.916 --> 11:20.182
Is that a thermocouple?

11:20.217 --> 11:21.784
CARTER: I gave it to him!
Yeah, uh...

11:21.819 --> 11:23.519
It's a digital
wireless thermocouple

11:23.554 --> 11:25.320
with downloadable memory.

11:25.356 --> 11:26.655
Wow. Can I see that?

11:26.690 --> 11:28.557
Yeah, sure.
BRENNAN: Can I see, too?

11:28.592 --> 11:30.726
Hey, a shoeprint.

11:34.231 --> 11:35.551
BRENNAN: It looks like
it's burned

11:35.566 --> 11:37.065
right into the concrete.

11:37.101 --> 11:38.767
MONTENEGRO:
<i>The security cameras</i>

11:38.803 --> 11:42.371
outside the plumbing and
electrical room were turned off.

11:42.406 --> 11:45.240
So we have no way of knowing who
went in and out of that room.

11:45.276 --> 11:46.909
You should get
everyone's cell phones,

11:46.944 --> 11:48.644
those smart glasses,

11:48.679 --> 11:51.580
anything that could be used
to take a picture or a video.

11:51.615 --> 11:53.048
Already on it.
Okay.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.583
Here we go.

11:54.618 --> 11:56.852
But isn't it still
too damaged?

11:56.887 --> 11:58.487
Well, for this computer, yeah,

11:58.522 --> 12:00.689
but I linked in with my system
at the Jeffersonian.

12:00.724 --> 12:03.325
It can take whatever data
is still on this stripe

12:03.360 --> 12:06.228
and check it against all
of the female registrants.

12:06.263 --> 12:08.397
(computer trilling)

12:14.071 --> 12:16.238
(sighs)
She's free.

12:18.042 --> 12:21.376
I need the remains transferred
to the Jeffersonian immediately.

12:21.412 --> 12:23.045
I'm still working,
Dr. Brennan.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.514
Yeah, me, too, and with these
people at this convention,

12:25.549 --> 12:27.683
we have all the tools
that we need.

12:29.386 --> 12:30.619
What are you doing?
Well,

12:30.654 --> 12:32.554
I am making
a mold of the shoeprint.

12:32.590 --> 12:33.722
With what?

12:33.757 --> 12:35.657
I got this
from some guy out there

12:35.693 --> 12:38.794
that's experimenting
with this inert polymer resin

12:38.829 --> 12:40.028
that's totally noninvasive.

12:40.064 --> 12:41.563
Yeah, I'm sorry I asked.

12:41.599 --> 12:43.031
Just keep at it.

12:43.067 --> 12:46.401
I really should develop
a few of my ideas.

12:49.306 --> 12:51.406
Oh, wow.

12:51.442 --> 12:53.442
Now, that, that is impressive.

12:53.477 --> 12:55.277
Whoa.

12:55.312 --> 12:57.246
SAROYAN: The rosy color
and creamy, curdled texture

12:57.281 --> 12:58.847
of this area of blood

12:58.883 --> 13:01.583
suggest the victim died
before the fire.

13:01.619 --> 13:02.818
There are injuries

13:02.853 --> 13:04.253
to the fourth sternal rib

13:04.288 --> 13:05.787
on the left side.

13:05.823 --> 13:07.256
Could be a stab wound.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.491
Tissue damage to the torso seems
to confirm that.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.692
What about time of death?

13:10.891 --> 13:12.190
Despite the damage done

13:12.225 --> 13:14.793
by the fire,
I see no signs of lividity

13:14.828 --> 13:15.960
or lactic buildup,

13:15.996 --> 13:17.896
so the victim must have died

13:17.931 --> 13:20.598
no more than one or two hours
before the fire was set.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.802
MONTENEGRO: <i>So there are four</i>
<i>female registrants</i>

13:23.837 --> 13:25.603
that are unaccounted for.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.706
I can match these pictures
with the ones I took

13:27.741 --> 13:30.742
of the victim.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.677
Oh, my God.
What?

13:32.713 --> 13:34.679
Leona Saunders.

13:34.715 --> 13:35.755
Who-who is Leona Saunders?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.248
Hodgins knew her.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.150
They-they talked
just before she died.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.752
About what?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.353
I don't know.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.955
I-I don't know, I wasn't there.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.831
Hodgins?
Yeah?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.400
You knew, uh, Leona Saunders?

13:55.435 --> 13:58.036
Unfortunately. Why?
What is she doing now?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.771
Well, she's dead,
she's our victim.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.072
Are you serious?

14:01.108 --> 14:02.841
Yeah.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.776
Oh, my God.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.879
Wow, I feel terrible
because I don't feel terrible.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.414
Well, if you have
any information...

14:09.449 --> 14:10.915
No, I don't have
any information.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.817
We talked--
well, we argued, actually.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.619
Argued? That doesn't sound good.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.720
When I was in college,
I designed

14:15.756 --> 14:17.122
an odor-recognition system

14:17.157 --> 14:18.623
for locating buried
human remains, right?

14:18.658 --> 14:20.325
It contained a small box
with ten sensors

14:20.360 --> 14:22.894
to respond to 20 different
classes of chemicals

14:22.929 --> 14:24.129
that decaying bodies emit.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.231
Stop. Just cut to the chase.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.632
She stole my plans.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.967
She claimed them as her own.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.602
Wound about making
about four million bucks

14:30.637 --> 14:33.338
off of it. Anyway, she shows
up today and she wants to,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.473
like, make up like nothing
ever happened.

14:35.509 --> 14:37.208
You got to be kidding. You
realize that doesn't look good?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.576
All right?
You're arguing minutes

14:38.612 --> 14:40.278
before our victim was killed?

14:40.313 --> 14:41.412
Are you serious, Booth?

14:41.448 --> 14:42.747
There's probably
a line of people

14:42.783 --> 14:43.948
who hated her.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.617
Guys, can we just focus
on the evidence,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.385
because it certainly
does not point to me.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.853
I didn't say that it did.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.466
But we have to look at you
just like we would

14:50.466 --> 14:53.040
any other person of interest.
This is unbelievable.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.272
This is the third time

14:54.273 --> 14:56.307
I've been a murder suspect.

14:56.342 --> 14:57.574
That makes me want
to kill someone

14:57.610 --> 14:59.076
so you don't waste your time.

15:00.212 --> 15:01.578
It was a joke.

15:01.614 --> 15:03.213
I was joking.

15:03.249 --> 15:06.016
Do you want to see the evidence
I found or what?

15:06.052 --> 15:07.184
Sure do.
Yeah, we do.

15:07.219 --> 15:08.452
Let's see.
All right, okay.

15:08.487 --> 15:09.853
What I got here is,

15:09.889 --> 15:13.057
I found olive oil and canola oil
on the shoeprint

15:13.092 --> 15:14.391
along with food particulates.
Now, that,

15:14.427 --> 15:15.826
plus the design of
the actual shoe itself,

15:15.861 --> 15:17.094
makes me think
maybe we're looking

15:17.129 --> 15:18.295
for someone that worked
in the kitchen.

15:18.331 --> 15:19.697
Makes sense. Dr. Brennan said

15:19.732 --> 15:21.052
there might have been
stab wounds.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.633
Okay, this is good.
So the kitchen knife

15:22.668 --> 15:24.401
is possibly the murder weapon.

15:24.437 --> 15:25.636
Let me... Get the mold.

15:25.671 --> 15:26.904
(beeps)

15:26.939 --> 15:29.173
The mold!

15:29.208 --> 15:30.474
No, Aubrey,

15:30.509 --> 15:33.043
not the positive,
the negative.

15:40.086 --> 15:41.118
Okay, great, got it.

15:41.153 --> 15:42.720
Listen, Aubrey...

15:42.755 --> 15:43.987
Aubrey, what's taking
you so long, all right?

15:44.023 --> 15:45.589
Assistant manager just told me

15:45.624 --> 15:47.157
that one of the kitchen
workers clocked out early.

15:47.193 --> 15:48.258
He's still in the kitchen?

15:48.294 --> 15:50.160
Just left.
Okay, you're fast.

15:51.797 --> 15:54.898
H-Hold it right there! FBI.
Don't move.

15:54.934 --> 15:56.967
I-I didn't do anything.
Right, you didn't do anything.

15:57.002 --> 15:59.303
You're just taking off to do
a little charity work, huh?

15:59.338 --> 16:01.338
I'm sick; I got a stomach thing.

16:01.374 --> 16:03.440
Yeah, poor baby.
Give us your shoe.

16:03.476 --> 16:05.175
What?
BOOTH: Your shoe.

16:05.211 --> 16:07.378
Take off your right shoe
and throw it over here.

16:07.413 --> 16:10.314
Easy.

16:10.349 --> 16:11.448
Drop your bag.

16:13.519 --> 16:15.185
Hmm?

16:15.221 --> 16:16.387
Perfect match.

16:16.422 --> 16:17.888
Oh, perfect match, huh?

16:17.923 --> 16:19.957
Looks like we found Cinderella.
Okay, turn around.

16:19.992 --> 16:21.258
(sighs)

16:21.293 --> 16:23.193
Hands on the head,
let's go.

16:25.790 --> 16:27.560
AUBREY:
<i>Let's see here, Malik Farris.</i>

16:27.561 --> 16:30.462
Two years for robbery,
three years for assault,

16:30.498 --> 16:31.697
four years for arson?

16:31.732 --> 16:33.632
Oh, arson, what a coincidence.

16:33.668 --> 16:37.136
Man, you got me down there bad,
but I'm not that guy no more.

16:37.171 --> 16:38.537
That why we found
the victim's empty wallet

16:38.572 --> 16:40.172
in the kitchen trash?

16:40.207 --> 16:42.007
Because that would be another
coincidence, wouldn't it?

16:42.043 --> 16:44.276
Yeah, coincidence.

16:44.312 --> 16:46.211
And you had all
of this cash on you.

16:46.247 --> 16:48.414
Help me out here,
Malik, huh?

16:48.449 --> 16:51.650
A successful forensic
entomologist has no money,

16:51.686 --> 16:55.654
but a dishwasher fresh
out of jail has $560.

16:55.690 --> 16:56.789
What's wrong with this picture?

16:56.824 --> 16:58.190
The picture's racist.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.692
That's what's wrong with it.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.661
What, a man of color
can't have money, huh?

17:02.697 --> 17:04.496
All right, look,
I don't know about you,

17:04.531 --> 17:06.765
but I'm tired of dancing,
all right?

17:06.800 --> 17:10.368
We have your shoeprint
at the murder scene, Malik.

17:13.140 --> 17:17.242
Okay, sometimes I use that place
to herb down a little bit.

17:17.278 --> 17:18.544
You know what I'm saying?

17:18.579 --> 17:19.979
But this time there
was a dead body,

17:19.981 --> 17:21.946
the whole place stunk
of gasoline,

17:21.983 --> 17:23.382
I thought it was ready to blow,

17:23.416 --> 17:25.351
so, you know,
I got out of there real fast.

17:25.386 --> 17:27.252
Of course you didn't tell anyone
about the dead woman

17:27.288 --> 17:29.021
or the potential explosion.
Come on, man.

17:29.056 --> 17:30.289
You seen my rap sheet.

17:30.324 --> 17:31.557
Something like this goes down,

17:31.592 --> 17:33.258
I'm the first guy to get blamed.

17:33.294 --> 17:34.827
And look at me, here I am.

17:34.862 --> 17:37.096
You're here because
you left your shoeprint

17:37.131 --> 17:38.764
at the crime scene,
and you stole cash

17:38.799 --> 17:40.232
off a dead woman.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.600
I mean, you honestly think

17:41.635 --> 17:43.769
we won't find your prints
on that wallet?

17:43.804 --> 17:46.038
Look, if you're innocent,

17:46.073 --> 17:48.907
why don't you just tell us
what else you saw in there?

17:48.943 --> 17:51.310
Or who else?

17:51.345 --> 17:54.413
Man, I want a public defender,
and a sober one.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.716
I don't want to have to go back
to the joint.

18:01.589 --> 18:03.088
There's evidence of striations

18:03.124 --> 18:04.523
on the fifth and sixth
left ribs,

18:04.558 --> 18:06.558
the fifth and seventh
right ribs,

18:06.594 --> 18:09.028
and here on the left margin
of the sternum.

18:09.063 --> 18:10.529
More evidence of
knife wounds?

18:10.564 --> 18:12.364
Possibly, but I need
to clean the bones

18:12.400 --> 18:14.099
so Dr. Brennan and I can make
a conclusive determination.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.734
Not yet, brother.

18:15.770 --> 18:17.469
I haven't finished
my particulates sweep.

18:17.505 --> 18:19.004
It's taking a long time.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.573
Yeah, well, this woman is
covered in food refuse.

18:21.609 --> 18:24.343
I think that she was transferred
there in a garbage can.

18:24.378 --> 18:26.545
The dishwasher has access
to the garbage cans.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.680
People see him wheeling them
around every day.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.749
No one would suspect a thing.
You know, if you

18:30.785 --> 18:33.886
gave me a hand, I could finish
my job a lot faster.

18:33.921 --> 18:35.220
If it gets me cleaning the
bones sooner, I'm all yours.

18:35.256 --> 18:36.422
All right, then,

18:36.457 --> 18:37.890
walk this way, Mr. Bray,

18:37.925 --> 18:40.793
into the wonderful world
of forceps and swabbing.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.096
Looks like the organ gods
are smiling down on us.

18:44.131 --> 18:46.065
I've got a stomach.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.833
Think you can recover
anything from it?

18:47.868 --> 18:50.969
Let's hope so.

18:56.610 --> 18:58.577
BOOTH: Oh, look at you, huh?
This is a treat.

18:58.612 --> 19:00.345
I thought you would be stuck
in the lab.

19:00.381 --> 19:02.081
I can't do anything
until the bones are clean.

19:02.116 --> 19:04.316
Right.
They're so covered in particulates,

19:04.351 --> 19:06.018
I don't know when that'll be.
How did you get away?

19:06.053 --> 19:08.654
Uh, suspect washed out.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.522
The dishwasher?
Yeah.

19:10.558 --> 19:12.091
You know, the surveillance
camera caught him

19:12.126 --> 19:15.427
in the dining room.
The timestamp was 11:58 a.m.

19:15.463 --> 19:17.830
So there's no way he could get
from the dining room

19:17.865 --> 19:19.565
to the plumbing
and electric room

19:19.600 --> 19:21.433
in time to set the victim
on fire.

19:21.469 --> 19:22.668
Nah.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.869
Ah, look at that, huh?

19:23.904 --> 19:25.838
Hey, thank you.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.005
Thank you.
Wait a second.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.340
Did you order this for me?

19:28.375 --> 19:30.309
You are so sweet. Thank you.
(chuckles)

19:30.344 --> 19:33.245
I'm no closer to finding
the killer

19:33.280 --> 19:35.547
than I was when the remains
were smoldering.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.449
Oh.

19:37.485 --> 19:39.585
"Oh," what?
You think you'll look bad

19:39.620 --> 19:41.787
in front
of all these forensic geeks

19:41.822 --> 19:43.055
if it takes you too long

19:43.090 --> 19:44.289
to solve this one.

19:44.325 --> 19:45.765
If I solve this one.
All right, look.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.126
I'll bet you 100 bucks

19:47.161 --> 19:49.027
that they'll be
even more jealous

19:49.063 --> 19:51.296
when it's done.
Booth, you're in Gamblers Anonymous.

19:51.332 --> 19:52.664
You shouldn't be betting.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.266
Right, and you're a genius,
all right?

19:54.301 --> 19:56.468
So don't say stupid things.
Have some pie.

19:56.504 --> 19:58.804
Well, maybe a bite.
Come on, have some pie, all right?

19:58.839 --> 19:59.905
Here, have a piece of the pie.

19:59.940 --> 20:02.007
Hello, synthetic rubber.

20:02.042 --> 20:03.876
All right, well,
this is some kind of copolymer.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.645
So, so far we have got
coffee grounds,

20:06.680 --> 20:09.148
melted aluminum foil,
two kinds of plastic,

20:09.183 --> 20:11.717
polyester, Styrofoam,
gum and rubber.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.719
And two trays of stuff
yet to be identified.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.521
Particulates. Don't say "stuff."

20:15.556 --> 20:16.688
It's sacrilege.

20:16.724 --> 20:18.524
You really doing good?
Yeah.

20:18.559 --> 20:20.926
Yeah, I'm back at the gym.
I can even have a beer.

20:20.961 --> 20:22.227
I'm a big fan of remission.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.595
We all are.

20:23.631 --> 20:24.863
And the trial is having
great success.

20:24.899 --> 20:26.179
There are 12 of us in the group,

20:26.200 --> 20:27.332
and everyone's doing well.

20:27.368 --> 20:28.567
Three cheers
for modern science, huh?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.435
Yeah.

20:30.471 --> 20:32.704
Oh, I got something weird here.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.506
Looks like tissue.

20:34.542 --> 20:35.741
Hey, um,

20:35.776 --> 20:37.609
do you mind
if I do the honors?

20:37.645 --> 20:38.777
You are in remission.

20:38.812 --> 20:41.780
You can do
whatever you want.

20:41.815 --> 20:44.616
Not tissue, it's gummy.

20:44.652 --> 20:46.172
Can you put it up on the monitor?
Yeah.

20:46.187 --> 20:48.620
A piece of a Band-Aid?

20:48.656 --> 20:50.222
Yeah.

20:50.257 --> 20:52.524
If it was worn, maybe Cam
can pull some DNA off of it?

20:52.560 --> 20:54.693
No, it's been in a fire.
Cam wouldn't have a chance.

20:54.728 --> 20:56.929
Wouldn't have
a chance of what?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.697
Uh, of getting some DNA
off this Band-Aid we found.

20:58.732 --> 21:00.866
Oh, Dr. Hodgins is right.

21:00.901 --> 21:03.368
Odds are against it,
but it's worth a shot.

21:03.404 --> 21:06.572
And I have a gift
for you in return.

21:06.607 --> 21:08.473
The victim's last meal.
Ah.

21:08.509 --> 21:11.076
Based on digestion,
ingested around 3:00 a.m.

21:11.111 --> 21:12.644
I need it analyzed and ID'd.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.479
Might be able to tell us
where the victim was

21:14.515 --> 21:15.981
or who she was with
before she died.

21:16.016 --> 21:17.883
You got it.

21:17.918 --> 21:20.285
BRENNAN: There's no obvious
defensive injuries,

21:20.321 --> 21:22.521
so the victim might
have known the killer.

21:22.556 --> 21:24.756
Or was just unafraid
of the killer.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.326
Enlarge the sternum?

21:27.361 --> 21:28.961
Okay.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.429
The sternum.

21:30.464 --> 21:31.830
An oldie but a goodie, huh?

21:31.865 --> 21:33.832
(computer trilling)

21:35.002 --> 21:36.969
BRENNAN:
There is a spiderweb fracture

21:37.004 --> 21:38.136
on the sternum.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.504
The victim was struck

21:39.540 --> 21:43.075
and winded, giving the assailant
time to stab.

21:43.110 --> 21:45.510
So someone who knew
what they were doing.

21:47.047 --> 21:48.480
I've got the DNA results

21:48.515 --> 21:50.482
from the Band-Aid found
on the remains.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.850
And?

21:52.987 --> 21:55.354
I'm sure it's easily explained.

21:55.389 --> 21:56.688
What?

21:56.724 --> 21:59.091
What is it?

21:59.126 --> 22:02.828
The DNA's a match
for Dr. Hodgins.

22:09.143 --> 22:10.709
All right, let's go in here.

22:10.745 --> 22:13.929
Oh, come... the interrogation
room? Really, Booth?

22:13.930 --> 22:15.696
(laughs) Come on,
we got to do things by the book.

22:15.731 --> 22:16.997
You understand.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.866
Do you really think
that I killed Leona?

22:18.901 --> 22:21.502
No, of course not.
But you did have a motive.

22:21.537 --> 22:22.436
Because I hated her?

22:22.471 --> 22:23.871
I told <i> you</i> that, Aubrey.

22:23.906 --> 22:25.372
Come on, Booth, this is dumb.

22:25.408 --> 22:26.707
I mean, you know me.

22:26.742 --> 22:28.142
Listen, the prosecutor
gets copies

22:28.177 --> 22:29.977
of everything
that we find, okay?

22:30.012 --> 22:31.512
They're gonna need
explanations, Hodgins.

22:31.547 --> 22:32.980
So, have a seat, sit down.

22:33.015 --> 22:35.583
So, we sit down, we have
a little conversation,

22:35.618 --> 22:37.885
and you explain
yourself. Come on!

22:37.920 --> 22:40.688
So, woman steals your invention,
makes millions...

22:40.723 --> 22:42.523
Yes, $4 million.

22:42.558 --> 22:43.891
It's a lot of money.

22:43.926 --> 22:45.659
But I was worth billions
at the time.

22:45.695 --> 22:46.927
But you're not anymore.

22:46.963 --> 22:48.596
Now you could use that money.

22:48.631 --> 22:51.365
Some might say that could
make you lose control, lash out.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.834
Wow, and I thought
I was gonna like you, Aubrey.

22:53.869 --> 22:55.736
Hodgins, he's just
asking questions.

22:55.771 --> 22:57.404
He's got to do his job, okay?

22:57.440 --> 22:59.840
The prosecutor is gonna see
the money thing as a motive.

22:59.875 --> 23:03.310
There's also some hard evidence,
might raise a few red flags.

23:03.346 --> 23:05.913
Okay, all right.
This should be good,

23:05.948 --> 23:08.649
since I'm the one sifting
through that evidence. Please.

23:08.684 --> 23:10.317
It was a Band-Aid,
piece of a Band-Aid

23:10.353 --> 23:12.886
that was found on the body
with your DNA on it.

23:12.922 --> 23:14.855
Yes, because I cut
my finger this morning.

23:14.890 --> 23:17.024
This one.
BOOTH (laughs): That's a good one.

23:17.059 --> 23:18.359
Right there, okay?

23:18.394 --> 23:19.693
I was making
Michael Vincent's lunch,

23:19.729 --> 23:21.428
I cut myself,
put a Band-Aid on it.

23:21.464 --> 23:23.330
By the time we got to the
convention, it stopped bleeding,

23:23.366 --> 23:25.265
so I took it off,
I threw it in the trash.

23:25.301 --> 23:27.968
Yeah, but it wasn't in the
trash, it was on the victim.

23:28.004 --> 23:31.071
Yes, because the killer
tossed a load of trash

23:31.107 --> 23:32.506
onto the victim
to confuse us.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.108
The crime scene
was staged, Booth, okay?

23:34.143 --> 23:36.577
Whoever did this knew
what they were doing.

23:36.612 --> 23:38.612
Someone like you...
Okay, that's enough.

23:38.648 --> 23:39.947
What? I like the guy, too.

23:39.982 --> 23:42.249
But it's like you said--
we got a job to do.

23:42.284 --> 23:44.084
The DOJ's gonna think
we're playing favorites here.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.020
He answered
your questions, right?

23:46.055 --> 23:47.421
Yeah.

23:47.456 --> 23:48.656
Yeah, okay? So he can go.

23:48.691 --> 23:49.723
You can go.

23:49.759 --> 23:51.091
I can leave?
Yes, you can.

23:51.961 --> 23:53.761
Really?
Yeah.

23:53.796 --> 23:55.629
Listen, I know
what it's like to be innocent,

23:55.665 --> 23:57.131
and have a bunch
of circumstantial evidence,

23:57.166 --> 23:58.432
you know,
stacked against you.

23:58.467 --> 24:00.401
Thank you, Booth.

24:00.436 --> 24:02.002
And I really do think
you're a good guy.

24:02.038 --> 24:03.038
Yeah, great.

24:03.072 --> 24:04.371
So please don't be the killer.

24:04.407 --> 24:06.306
Stop, all right. Really?

24:06.342 --> 24:08.342
Yeah, sure.

24:08.377 --> 24:10.778
The indentations
on the right side are deeper

24:10.813 --> 24:12.780
than the indentations
on the left side.

24:12.815 --> 24:13.815
What does that mean?

24:13.849 --> 24:15.749
It indicates the disambiguation

24:15.785 --> 24:17.651
of a right-handed assailant,

24:17.687 --> 24:20.754
because these blows
show more strength.

24:20.790 --> 24:23.290
The fatal blows to the
left side are weaker

24:23.325 --> 24:26.593
and not as specifically
placed as those on the right.

24:26.629 --> 24:30.497
Indicative of someone who is
not used to using his left hand.

24:30.533 --> 24:32.232
He was trying to confuse us.

24:32.268 --> 24:34.001
But he wasn't
successful, was he?

24:34.036 --> 24:35.036
(cell phone sounding)

24:35.037 --> 24:36.336
Sorry, um...

24:36.372 --> 24:37.604
I have an appointment.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.139
The clinical trial?

24:39.175 --> 24:41.108
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
I-I can cancel if you...

24:41.143 --> 24:42.576
You're of no use to me

24:42.611 --> 24:44.378
if your cancer returns
and you die, Mr. Bray.

24:44.413 --> 24:45.746
I can manage
until you come back.

24:45.781 --> 24:47.247
It usually takes
about an hour.

24:47.283 --> 24:49.383
I-I get the medicine,
they take my blood...

24:49.418 --> 24:52.486
I know. I'm happy
it seems to be working.

24:54.757 --> 24:56.857
Thanks, Dr. B.

24:58.527 --> 25:00.561
HODGINS:
Hey!

25:00.596 --> 25:02.362
I have got some
good news for you.

25:02.398 --> 25:03.731
You're back-- that's
excellent news.

25:03.766 --> 25:04.766
Yeah, well,
there's more.

25:04.767 --> 25:06.200
So, the stomach contents--

25:06.235 --> 25:08.435
turns out there was
wine sediment in the mix,

25:08.471 --> 25:09.970
made from a very rare,

25:10.005 --> 25:12.072
almost extinct French grape
called carmenere.

25:12.108 --> 25:14.041
Can you trace it?
I already did.

25:14.076 --> 25:16.110
It was only used by
four French vintners--

25:16.145 --> 25:18.512
Pauillac, Margaux,
Latour and Lafite.

25:18.547 --> 25:20.180
All very expensive wines.

25:20.216 --> 25:21.648
Yeah, exactly.
And the mass spec

25:21.684 --> 25:23.717
also identified
strawberries and chocolate.

25:23.753 --> 25:25.953
Sounds like our victim had
a little romantic dinner

25:25.988 --> 25:27.321
on her last night.

25:27.356 --> 25:29.590
With someone who really
knows their wine.

25:29.625 --> 25:32.359
So, we have to trace Leona's
last steps in order to...

25:32.394 --> 25:34.027
No, actually we don't.

25:34.063 --> 25:37.397
So, I called the room service
manager at the hotel.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.066
The night before
Leona was murdered,

25:39.101 --> 25:40.661
a tray of chocolate-covered
strawberries

25:40.669 --> 25:42.536
was delivered
to a guest

25:42.571 --> 25:44.638
along with a thousand-dollar
bottle of Chateau Margaux.

25:44.673 --> 25:48.609
Let me guess, the hotel guest
was Leona Saunders.

25:48.644 --> 25:50.477
No, it was Dr. Edward Harkness,

25:50.513 --> 25:53.647
the director of the Forensic
Science Convention.

25:53.682 --> 25:57.017
AUBREY: We know that Leona Saunders was
in your room at 3:00 a.m.

25:57.052 --> 25:59.586
on the morning of the day
she was murdered.

25:59.622 --> 26:01.722
Because the Jeffersonian
found the sediment

26:01.757 --> 26:04.925
from the Margaux in
her stomach, correct?

26:04.960 --> 26:07.461
Correct.

26:07.496 --> 26:10.197
Yes, I was
expecting this.

26:10.232 --> 26:12.833
"A great, a good and
a right mind is a kind

26:12.868 --> 26:15.536
"of divinity
lodged in flesh.

26:15.571 --> 26:18.138
Sadly it is always the flesh
that gets the better of us."

26:18.174 --> 26:19.206
(chuckles)

26:19.241 --> 26:20.707
Seneca.

26:20.743 --> 26:22.910
Ah! You know your classics,
young man.

26:22.945 --> 26:24.278
Mm-hmm. Bravo.

26:24.313 --> 26:26.947
Ironically, my
relationship

26:26.982 --> 26:28.849
with Leona started at the
convention last year.

26:28.884 --> 26:32.352
As you, well,
may be aware,

26:32.388 --> 26:36.523
conventions usually devolve
into carnivals of indiscretion.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.458
And even I,
the ringmaster,

26:38.494 --> 26:41.428
fell victim to its
hedonistic pleasures.

26:41.463 --> 26:43.363
So, you cheated on your wife,

26:43.399 --> 26:45.032
now you've turned it
into a poem.

26:45.067 --> 26:46.633
That's great.

26:46.669 --> 26:48.702
Why don't you just
tell me what happened?

26:48.737 --> 26:51.205
Leona was the
love of my life.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.639
So, what's the story?

26:52.675 --> 26:54.408
Did she meet somebody else
at the convention? What?

26:54.443 --> 26:57.644
No, I was not
the jealous one.

27:00.049 --> 27:02.249
There was another
woman before Leona.

27:02.284 --> 27:04.885
She hired me as a forensic
research consultant

27:04.920 --> 27:06.587
for a book she was writing.

27:06.622 --> 27:07.921
We started
seeing each other.

27:07.957 --> 27:10.958
But when I met Leona,
I broke it off.

27:10.993 --> 27:14.461
She never forgave me
for leaving her.

27:14.496 --> 27:16.096
And your other woman?

27:16.131 --> 27:18.298
Tess Brown.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.277
Hey, Dr. B.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.444
So, I identified
some particulate matter

27:27.480 --> 27:28.913
I found in the remains.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.714
It was in
the stab wounds.

27:30.750 --> 27:31.816
What is it?

27:31.851 --> 27:33.083
Obsidian.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.418
Oh, obsidian was used

27:34.453 --> 27:36.253
as early as the Acheulean
Age for weapons.

27:36.289 --> 27:38.289
Yeah, well, I think it's still
being used for weapons.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.456
How much did you find?

27:39.492 --> 27:41.458
About 600 grams.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.060
Sufficient mass
for an obsidian knife.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.696
And a magnesium fire would
melt an obsidian knife,

27:45.731 --> 27:47.731
leaving only traces
of a murder weapon.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.868
Tess Brown used an obsidian
weapon in her first novel.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.404
I'll check the bones
for other fragments.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.672
Okay.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.307
Hey, I thought Wendell
was helping you out.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.542
Oh, he had an appointment
for his clinical trial.

27:58.578 --> 27:59.944
He should be back...

28:01.247 --> 28:04.281
Actually, he was supposed
to be back by now.

28:04.317 --> 28:06.217
I thought he said
that he was just going

28:06.252 --> 28:07.618
to get a quick injection.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.854
Should we be worried?

28:11.424 --> 28:12.424
Of course not.

28:12.425 --> 28:13.557
No, I'm...

28:13.593 --> 28:14.692
There's probably traffic.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.862
Yeah. Yeah.

28:27.773 --> 28:29.874
AUBREY: <i> I talked to your</i>
<i>publisher-- he dropped you.</i>

28:29.909 --> 28:33.277
Because of a video where I said
a few inappropriate things.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.912
Right, like calling
your fans "idiots."

28:34.947 --> 28:36.247
I have a neighbor
who reads your books,

28:36.282 --> 28:37.448
she's definitely an idiot.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.149
Right.
So your publisher gave you

28:39.185 --> 28:41.085
another shot because you had
another big idea for a book.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.686
Yes.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.356
Which you titled
<i>Hotter than My Heart.</i>

28:45.391 --> 28:47.258
Kind of a crime in itself.

28:47.293 --> 28:50.594
Murder at a forensic convention
with, uh, cops and experts.

28:50.630 --> 28:52.429
That's ironic.

28:52.465 --> 28:56.033
There's no crime in being at the
right place at the right time.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.702
No, it is if you were lying
about where you were.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.371
We have video evidence
that proves you were never

29:00.406 --> 29:01.926
in the ballroom
like you said you were.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.642
Do you think I'd commit a murder
to get a book deal?

29:04.677 --> 29:06.677
Yeah, I do.
I actually think you would.

29:06.712 --> 29:10.214
But, you know what,
that's not why you killed Leona.

29:10.249 --> 29:14.018
Why don't you tell us about your
relationship with Dr. Harkness?

29:14.053 --> 29:17.721
I hired him as a forensic
consultant on one of my books.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.691
He read my manuscript,
gave me some notes.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.159
It was purely professional.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.694
"Purely professional."
Do you hear that?

29:23.729 --> 29:25.429
I'm sure he gave you lots
of information on how

29:25.464 --> 29:27.231
to commit a murder, that
must have been really helpful.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.200
We also have evidence you and
Dr. Harkness spent time together

29:30.236 --> 29:33.837
at several hotels
in Miami, Las Vegas, Hawaii.

29:33.873 --> 29:37.408
BOOTH:
Hawaii.<i> Aloha e.</i>

29:37.443 --> 29:39.209
What did Edward say?

29:39.245 --> 29:41.412
That stumpy little toad.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.847
Well, he said that you
became very, very jealous

29:43.883 --> 29:46.417
after you found out
about, uh, Leona.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.653
Right now, he's looking
pretty credible.

29:49.689 --> 29:51.655
You know...

29:51.691 --> 29:53.324
I hired another consultant.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.092
An attorney.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.428
And I'd like to call her right
now, if you don't mind.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.302
Any word from Wendell?

30:05.338 --> 30:06.537
Not yet.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.339
Do you think we can
call the doctors

30:08.374 --> 30:09.473
who are administering the trial?

30:09.508 --> 30:10.607
Maybe something happened to him.

30:10.643 --> 30:11.875
I did.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.244
They wouldn't tell me anything.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.779
Confidentiality.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.514
I can barely work.

30:17.550 --> 30:20.050
But we have to, don't we?

30:20.086 --> 30:22.119
There's a slight discoloration
on the ilium

30:22.154 --> 30:23.954
I didn't see before.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.192
The victim showed symptoms
of arthritis.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.727
It could have been
from minocycline use.

30:29.762 --> 30:31.328
This is localized
to the ilium.

30:31.364 --> 30:33.097
We've been working
under the assumption

30:33.132 --> 30:36.934
that the killer used gasoline
to ignite the magnesium strips.

30:36.969 --> 30:41.405
But what if that were a mask
for a third accelerant?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.440
Do you think Tess Brown
would be able to engineer

30:43.476 --> 30:44.842
something that complicated?

30:44.877 --> 30:46.910
Dr. Harkness is quite brilliant
in his field.

30:46.946 --> 30:51.015
If he were her mentor,
it's a very real possibility.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.483
So, we're looking
for a third accelerant,

30:52.518 --> 30:54.518
something that the
gasoline could obfuscate.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.688
I can't tell you how flattered I
am that you asked me to be here.

30:57.723 --> 31:00.157
The Jeffersonian is
the pinnacle...

31:00.192 --> 31:01.392
Yeah, it's pretty
cool, isn't it?

31:01.427 --> 31:02.726
Can we get
back on track?

31:02.762 --> 31:04.661
Uh, yes, of course.

31:05.998 --> 31:09.099
Looks like sulfuric acid
and potassium chlorate.

31:09.135 --> 31:10.667
Yeah, now that is
the perfect recipe

31:10.703 --> 31:13.704
for igniting magnesium strips,
don't you think?

31:13.739 --> 31:15.139
Yes, perhaps,
but sulfuric...

31:15.174 --> 31:16.640
Excuse me,
Dr. Hodgins?

31:16.675 --> 31:18.409
I'm Aldus Carter,
I'm not sure if you remember.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.444
Uh...
What are you doing here?

31:20.479 --> 31:23.680
I think the real question is--
what are <i> you</i> doing here?

31:23.716 --> 31:25.115
I was asked to help

31:25.151 --> 31:27.451
because of my world-renowned
expertise in arson.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.521
"Expertise"?! His lab was
shut down for starting a fire

31:30.556 --> 31:33.757
in his apartment building.
Didn't tell you that, did he?

31:33.793 --> 31:35.192
Okay, stop.
Both of you, stop it.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.727
Now, how did you get in here?

31:36.762 --> 31:40.464
Magnetic coding is just one
of my many specialties.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.866
If you'd let me help you,
perhaps I could undo

31:42.902 --> 31:45.135
whatever damage this idiot
has no doubt done...

31:45.171 --> 31:46.837
Why you arrogant
little...

31:46.872 --> 31:47.872
Whoa-oa, hey, hey!

31:47.873 --> 31:48.972
Hey, hey, hey,
break it up!

31:49.008 --> 31:50.140
Hey, break it up.

31:50.176 --> 31:53.210
What the hell
is going on here?

31:53.245 --> 31:55.345
I asked him to come.

31:55.381 --> 31:56.847
And he just
showed up.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.115
This is a restricted area.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.550
You're both going
to have to leave.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.717
Now.

32:02.188 --> 32:06.190
Can you please escort these
men out of the building?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.492
Okay, okay.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.095
Compliments of Carter
Forensic Devices.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.466
Are you out
of your mind?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.800
You didn't even check
with me...

32:16.836 --> 32:18.102
Yeah, I... S-Sorry, sorry.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.369
It was my bad, Cam.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.004
But that just gave me
a great idea.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.406
Wait, look at this.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.042
So, sulfuric acid
and potassium chlorate,

32:25.077 --> 32:27.277
they react violently
when put together, right?

32:27.313 --> 32:29.246
Just like those two.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.216
But what if the potassium
chlorate and the sulfuric acid

32:32.251 --> 32:36.854
were separated by layers
and layers of aluminum foil,

32:36.889 --> 32:40.224
which I also found
on the murder remains?

32:40.259 --> 32:43.127
The sulfuric acid would eat
through the foil.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.294
Yeah, that's right.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.330
But slowly.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.797
Here, put these on.

32:46.832 --> 32:50.067
Because the foil would create
an ignition delay...

32:50.102 --> 32:51.635
Yeah, a chemical
timing device.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.770
Got it.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.177
HODGINS:
Whoa!

33:00.212 --> 33:01.979
(laughs)
Wow.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.313
Oh!

33:03.349 --> 33:05.916
That's pretty cool, right?

33:05.951 --> 33:08.952
So the killer
wouldn't need to be

33:08.988 --> 33:10.354
in the plumbing
and electric room

33:10.389 --> 33:11.955
when the fire started.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.057
Then all the timelines
that Angela worked out,

33:14.093 --> 33:16.293
that cleared some of the
suspects, are meaningless.

33:16.328 --> 33:19.997
Which means none of
the suspects has an alibi.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.598
Including you.

33:21.634 --> 33:24.168
Including... me.

33:35.407 --> 33:38.041
I tried to call Wendell,
but there was no answer.

33:38.076 --> 33:39.209
I'm really
starting to worry.

33:39.244 --> 33:40.577
Don't.
Booth heard from him.

33:40.612 --> 33:41.612
He's fine.

33:41.613 --> 33:42.746
Oh!

33:42.781 --> 33:44.414
Then why isn't he here?

33:44.450 --> 33:46.817
I'm sure Booth will be
able to answer that.

33:46.852 --> 33:49.920
I'm trying to determine
why there's a puncture

33:49.955 --> 33:53.924
on the anterior surface of
the left fifth vertebral rib.

33:53.959 --> 33:55.759
Perimortem?
Yes.

33:55.794 --> 33:59.596
It lines up with
the obsidian knife wound

33:59.631 --> 34:02.833
on the fourth sternal rib
on the left side.

34:02.868 --> 34:05.135
But this one has no traces
of obsidian in it.

34:05.170 --> 34:07.304
So the obsidian knife
must've been used

34:07.339 --> 34:08.737
to cover up
the initial stab wound.

34:08.774 --> 34:10.072
Yes. Note that
no other wounds

34:10.108 --> 34:12.141
were deep enough
to leave traces

34:12.177 --> 34:14.210
on the vertebral ribs.

34:14.246 --> 34:17.147
The killer probably thought we were
going to stop at the obsidian knife,

34:17.181 --> 34:19.081
and not search
for another weapon.

34:19.117 --> 34:20.449
A very misguided assumption.

34:20.485 --> 34:23.620
I will make a mikrosil
impression of the injury

34:23.655 --> 34:24.788
and give it to Dr. Hodgins.

34:24.822 --> 34:27.190
Perhaps he can
identify the weapon.

34:39.571 --> 34:41.004
Hey.

34:41.039 --> 34:43.005
People don't know how
to drive in this city.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.139
What's going on?

34:44.176 --> 34:46.009
You good?
Yeah, I'm good.

34:46.043 --> 34:47.543
All right.

34:47.579 --> 34:49.813
Uh, sorry, I shouldn't
have called you, man.

34:49.848 --> 34:51.114
You're-you're...
you're busy.

34:51.149 --> 34:52.849
Come on!
What are you talking about, huh?

34:52.885 --> 34:55.018
You can't call your...
your hockey teammate,

34:55.053 --> 34:57.053
who can you call, right?

34:57.089 --> 34:58.989
Not sure I'm going
to be playing

34:59.024 --> 35:00.490
much more hockey anymore.

35:00.526 --> 35:02.659
Oh. Why is that?

35:02.694 --> 35:05.562
Did, uh...
it come back again?

35:05.597 --> 35:07.030
Not mine, no.

35:07.065 --> 35:08.698
But, uh...
(clears throat)

35:08.734 --> 35:11.167
one of the guys, uh,
in the clinical trial--

35:11.203 --> 35:13.603
uh, Ben--
has two little kids,

35:13.639 --> 35:16.640
four and a one-and-
a-half year old.

35:18.610 --> 35:20.911
Died on Tuesday.

35:21.847 --> 35:23.079
Oh.

35:23.115 --> 35:25.181
Yeah, yeah...

35:25.217 --> 35:26.716
yeah, I-I...

35:26.752 --> 35:28.518
I saw him four weeks ago,
and he was doing well,

35:28.554 --> 35:30.120
you know, just like me.

35:30.155 --> 35:32.989
Then, out of nowhere, the cancer
started spreading and...

35:35.527 --> 35:37.060
He was a good guy.

35:37.996 --> 35:39.930
I'm sorry.

35:39.965 --> 35:41.731
Yeah. Me, too.

35:43.969 --> 35:46.202
I really thought I was
going to get better.

35:46.238 --> 35:49.039
Wait a second-- just because one person
in your group doesn't get better,

35:49.074 --> 35:50.874
doesn't mean you're
not gonna get better.

35:50.909 --> 35:53.910
I mean, come on.
How do you feel?

35:53.946 --> 35:54.978
I feel good.

35:55.013 --> 35:57.514
But so did he,
a month ago.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.716
(sighs)

35:59.751 --> 36:03.820
You know, Wendell...
(clears throat)

36:03.855 --> 36:05.288
you know, back in '02,

36:05.324 --> 36:08.525
we had to secure
this ridge in Ghazni...

36:08.560 --> 36:11.761
before our major
forces came in.

36:11.797 --> 36:14.731
Little did we know the Taliban
had already been there.

36:14.766 --> 36:16.600
And they pinned us down
for about six days,

36:16.635 --> 36:18.435
and they kept
picking us off...

36:18.470 --> 36:20.303
one by one.

36:20.339 --> 36:21.972
15 guys went up
to that ridge,

36:22.007 --> 36:23.974
and only three came out.

36:24.009 --> 36:25.742
I know what you're
trying to do, Booth.

36:25.777 --> 36:27.510
I-I appreciate it; the doctors
tried to do the same thing.

36:27.546 --> 36:28.878
No, you don't.

36:28.914 --> 36:30.914
I don't think you know
what I'm talking about,

36:30.949 --> 36:32.248
and I don't think
you appreciate

36:32.284 --> 36:35.118
what I'm telling you
right now.

36:35.153 --> 36:38.288
What I'm telling you is
that I saw 12 of my brothers

36:38.323 --> 36:39.756
killed in front of me.

36:39.791 --> 36:41.925
Twelve.

36:44.029 --> 36:45.862
You got dealt a bad hand.

36:45.897 --> 36:48.164
Deal with it.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.265
(stammers quietly)

36:49.301 --> 36:51.167
Sorry.

36:51.203 --> 36:52.302
Enough with the apologies.

36:52.337 --> 36:53.470
Okay, Wendell?

36:53.505 --> 36:55.338
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself, man,

36:55.374 --> 36:57.641
and keep fighting.

37:01.613 --> 37:03.747
I don't need to see
another brother die.

37:12.357 --> 37:15.358
So, I have a match for the puncture
wound you found in the rib.

37:15.394 --> 37:16.793
Aldus Carter's thermocouple?!

37:16.828 --> 37:18.128
He did it?!

37:18.163 --> 37:20.096
You're absolutely
certain it's this one.

37:20.132 --> 37:21.765
His thermocouple has
this unique tip

37:21.800 --> 37:24.467
that matches the
mikrosil perfectly.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.202
BRENNAN: Didn't he say
this records data

37:26.238 --> 37:29.039
each time it takes
body temperature?

37:29.074 --> 37:30.407
Yeah, he did.

37:30.442 --> 37:32.308
Hey, so if Aldus used
this as a weapon,

37:32.344 --> 37:34.477
then that data should
be stored here, too.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.013
Well, that should be
easy to download.

37:39.851 --> 37:42.786
SAROYAN: There'll be one
reading that's from me,

37:42.821 --> 37:43.821
the rest will be his.

37:43.822 --> 37:44.822
(typing)
Okay...

37:44.823 --> 37:46.723
(computer beeps, whirrs)

37:46.758 --> 37:49.225
Huh.
There's only one entry.

37:49.261 --> 37:51.461
(sighs deeply)
That was mine, when I used it.

37:51.496 --> 37:52.962
So he must've erased it.

37:52.998 --> 37:54.831
Wait, hold on,
there might be another way.

37:54.866 --> 37:57.133
I found traces of
nano-composites

37:57.169 --> 37:59.035
with the nitrile rubber
on the remains.

37:59.071 --> 38:00.537
The examination gloves?
Could be.

38:00.572 --> 38:03.006
I mean, it's a superhydrophobic
coating, for sure.

38:03.041 --> 38:05.308
I'll need to do some tests
to be certain, but...

38:06.645 --> 38:08.378
Okay, well, check it out
and call me back.

38:08.413 --> 38:09.479
Great. Thanks.

38:09.514 --> 38:11.381
Okay, so what do we have?

38:11.416 --> 38:13.550
Aldus Carter placed an order
for a piece of obsidian

38:13.585 --> 38:15.351
from an online flintknapping
store a month ago.

38:15.387 --> 38:16.419
Flintknapping?!

38:16.455 --> 38:17.954
Making ancient tools
and weapons

38:17.989 --> 38:19.222
out of flint and obsidian.

38:19.257 --> 38:20.423
Lots of people do it.

38:20.459 --> 38:21.991
Just weird people, probably.

38:22.027 --> 38:23.760
Right, okay--
was the piece he ordered

38:23.795 --> 38:25.161
big enough
to make a knife?

38:25.197 --> 38:26.863
Oh, yeah.
If we get a search warrant,

38:26.898 --> 38:28.431
I bet we'll find the knapping
tools at his place.

38:28.467 --> 38:30.200
The hard hammers,
soft hammers--

38:30.235 --> 38:32.035
everything that he would've
needed to make his weapon.

38:32.070 --> 38:33.970
Okay, well, bring him in.
All right, great.

38:34.005 --> 38:35.405
Why are you following me?

38:36.742 --> 38:38.341
CARTER:
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

38:38.376 --> 38:40.410
After all that I've
done to help you

38:40.445 --> 38:41.778
with your investigation,

38:41.813 --> 38:44.114
you're accusing me
of killing this woman?

38:44.149 --> 38:46.116
I... I don't even know her.

38:46.151 --> 38:47.851
What possible motive
could I have?

38:47.886 --> 38:49.352
Well, getting rid of
Leona Saunders gave you

38:49.387 --> 38:50.820
an opportunity
to showcase your products.

38:50.856 --> 38:53.256
BRENNAN: Which led to
a substantial order

38:53.291 --> 38:56.126
from the Jeffersonian
and other contractors.

38:56.161 --> 38:58.194
I would never kill for money.

38:58.230 --> 38:59.270
We have the murder weapon.

38:59.297 --> 39:00.964
And it's not the obsidian knife

39:00.999 --> 39:04.267
you burned on the remains
in an attempt to mislead us.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.740
My thermocouple.

39:10.776 --> 39:12.408
But Dr. Saroyan is the one

39:12.444 --> 39:15.745
who planted those prongs
into the corpse, not me.

39:15.781 --> 39:17.147
Yeah, but you thought
that you could erase,

39:17.182 --> 39:18.715
you know, the memory
of this "thermal-cuppus."

39:18.750 --> 39:19.582
Thermocouple.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.184
It's a thermocouple.

39:21.219 --> 39:22.939
And you thought you could
cover your tracks.

39:22.954 --> 39:24.487
But... you forgot
about these.

39:24.523 --> 39:25.755
Those.

39:25.791 --> 39:27.724
BRENNAN: We found traces
of nitrile rubber

39:27.759 --> 39:30.660
with manganese oxide
polystyrene nano-composite

39:30.695 --> 39:32.962
fused to the burned
flesh of the victim.

39:32.998 --> 39:34.430
I can tie them to you.

39:34.466 --> 39:37.467
Oh... that's impossible.

39:37.502 --> 39:39.636
The rubber is an exact
match for your patented

39:39.671 --> 39:43.606
and, well, quite excellent
non-stick gloves, Mr. Carter.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.041
Couldn't do better
with a fingerprint.

39:45.076 --> 39:46.436
And do not compliment
the murderer.

39:46.444 --> 39:47.777
Sorry.

39:47.813 --> 39:49.779
Handling a corpse
with nitrile rubber

39:49.815 --> 39:51.581
does not leave trace
evidence, all right?

39:51.616 --> 39:53.249
That's why my gloves
are so good.

39:53.285 --> 39:55.618
True, unless you were
also handling

39:55.654 --> 39:57.854
razor-sharp strips
of magnesium

39:57.889 --> 40:00.924
which cut the glove
and, in this case,

40:00.959 --> 40:03.760
left traces of your DNA
on the rubber.

40:09.701 --> 40:12.635
That's brilliant.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.637
This has been a worthy defeat.

40:14.673 --> 40:16.673
(chuckles)

40:16.708 --> 40:18.308
That's it?

40:18.343 --> 40:19.609
Well, there's nothing more
to discuss, actually.

40:19.644 --> 40:20.877
Bones, there is a lot
to discuss here.

40:20.912 --> 40:21.912
What about Leona?

40:21.947 --> 40:23.213
Why her?

40:23.248 --> 40:26.482
Because of a video
spectral comparator

40:26.518 --> 40:28.451
I was developing.

40:28.486 --> 40:32.121
I found out she was
stealing my designs

40:32.157 --> 40:34.991
and that's the only reason
she was sleeping with me.

40:35.026 --> 40:36.125
Whoa!

40:36.161 --> 40:38.561
You...
and she was... wow.

40:38.597 --> 40:40.196
Well, that... Okay.

40:40.232 --> 40:41.397
Oh. Well...

40:41.433 --> 40:42.565
Whoa.

40:43.435 --> 40:44.435
Yeah.

40:44.436 --> 40:46.369
Um, sorry, one more thing.

40:46.404 --> 40:50.340
Um, I will still be able to work
on the comparator in prison.

40:50.375 --> 40:53.376
I think it could be very
valuable to your team.

40:53.411 --> 40:55.111
I look forward to seeing it.

40:55.146 --> 40:56.045
Really, Bones?

40:56.081 --> 40:57.081
Really.
No.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.114
What?
No!

40:58.149 --> 41:00.450
He still does good work.

41:00.485 --> 41:02.685
(indistinct,
excited conversation)

41:08.727 --> 41:10.093
I can't believe
Dr. B. was worried

41:10.128 --> 41:11.527
she'd look foolish
in front of everyone.

41:11.563 --> 41:13.129
She's the best, man.

41:13.164 --> 41:15.999
Sometimes people doubt
how strong they really are.

41:16.034 --> 41:17.166
HODGINS:
Hey, brother.

41:17.202 --> 41:19.202
You're back.
Is everything okay?

41:19.237 --> 41:20.503
Yeah, yeah,
I'm still in remission.

41:20.538 --> 41:22.205
Sorry I missed work.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.973
I was dealing with some stuff.
It won't happen again.

41:24.009 --> 41:24.841
HARKNESS:
Hello, everyone.

41:24.876 --> 41:26.709
(applause)
Hey.

41:28.213 --> 41:30.179
Thank you, thank you very much,
thank you. Okay.

41:30.215 --> 41:33.483
Yesterday, I tried to introduce
our keynote speaker,

41:33.518 --> 41:35.385
when all hell broke loose here

41:35.420 --> 41:37.787
at the National Forensic
Sciences Convention.

41:37.822 --> 41:39.889
But within 24 hours,
this incredible woman

41:39.925 --> 41:41.658
and her team

41:41.693 --> 41:44.394
not only conducted a complete
forensic investigation,

41:44.429 --> 41:46.129
they also solved the murder.

41:49.067 --> 41:51.668
Therefore,
and particularly in light

41:51.703 --> 41:53.036
of this remarkable feat,

41:53.071 --> 41:55.405
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce

41:55.440 --> 41:57.740
the remarkable
Dr. Temperance Brennan!

41:57.776 --> 41:59.976
(applause, whooping, whistling)

42:01.146 --> 42:03.713
(whistling)

42:09.454 --> 42:11.387
Thank you, thank you very much.

42:11.423 --> 42:13.089
(chuckles)

42:13.124 --> 42:15.625
The great Dr. Erwin Schrodinger

42:15.660 --> 42:17.927
gets pulled over for speeding.

42:17.963 --> 42:19.429
(quietly):
Oh, no.

42:19.464 --> 42:20.830
BRENNAN:
The police officer says,

42:20.865 --> 42:22.598
"What's in the trunk?"

42:22.634 --> 42:26.502
Schrodinger says, "A cat."

42:26.538 --> 42:29.439
The police officer says,
"Let me see,"

42:29.474 --> 42:31.641
and he opens the trunk and says:

42:31.676 --> 42:33.576
"This cat is dead."

42:33.611 --> 42:37.513
And Schrodinger says,
"Well, it is now."

42:37.549 --> 42:40.316
(hearty laughter)

42:42.020 --> 42:44.954
Hey, that worked!

42:44.990 --> 42:45.990
(laughs)

42:45.991 --> 42:47.790
Which reminds me

42:47.826 --> 42:50.460
of an astronaut I know

42:50.495 --> 42:54.664
who told me about a restaurant
he visited on the moon.

42:54.699 --> 42:56.099
"Great food," he said,

42:56.134 --> 42:58.001
"but no atmosphere."

42:58.036 --> 42:59.535
(laughs alone)

42:59.571 --> 43:01.838
Yes! That was...

43:04.476 --> 43:06.376
(clears throat)
I thought it was funny.
