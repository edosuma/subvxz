00:09.277 --> 00:11.145
- Erin.

- Jimmy.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.386
Do you want to, uh...

00:18.419 --> 00:20.421
- Oh, yeah.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.605
- Bunny always said
you were locked up.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.840
- Yeah.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.442
I've been out ten years.

00:43.111 --> 00:46.514
I was married. That's why
you didn't hear from me.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.583
We had two boys of our own.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.454
- [scoffs]

00:53.487 --> 00:57.558
Hmm. Married convict
with a whole nother family.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.393
There's a catch.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.331
- Nobody involved exactly had
their stuff together.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.436
But you turned out okay.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.504
- So, you're off the hook?

01:15.476 --> 01:18.879
I'm guessing you were
my secret admirer.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.315
All the hang-up calls?

01:21.349 --> 01:24.452
Flowers a couple months ago sent
from outside of Leavenworth?

01:24.485 --> 01:28.256
- Yeah. Went to visit a friend
who didn't make it out,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.624
which could've been me
about 12 different ways.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.298
I'll be in town a few days.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.603
I wasn't there for you then,

01:42.636 --> 01:45.473
but I'd like to be now,

01:45.506 --> 01:47.541
if you'll let me.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.679
- [sighs, scoffs]

01:57.251 --> 01:58.286
[glass thumps]

01:58.319 --> 01:59.653
I'm glad we met.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.724
You enjoy Chicago.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.363
- Female victim.
Young, black...

02:09.396 --> 02:10.898
pretty--not that it matters.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.366
- Everything matters.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.602
- This school falls
in a safe passage zone.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.204
Two tac teams assigned.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.239
They're rolling in
any minute.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.407
All eyes are on us.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.941
This block is
supposed to be safe.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.376
- Copy.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.746
- Rough one.
Grace Johnson, 22 years old.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.516
- She's not in the system.
No priors. Nothing.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.683
Found her bag nearby.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.918
She definitely wasn't robbed,

02:30.951 --> 02:32.386
but there's
barely any blood here,

02:32.420 --> 02:33.721
so she was probably killed
someplace else

02:33.754 --> 02:35.223
and then dumped.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.957
- Well, she fought back.
Defensive wounds.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.260
She's got skin
under her fingernails.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.229
Three small-caliber
bullet wounds.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.297
- There's marks around her neck.
Looks like she was strangled,

02:43.331 --> 02:44.598
but the ME's not gonna know
cause of death

02:44.632 --> 02:46.267
till she gets her on the table.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.968
- Hey, Kenny, listen.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.505
Bag her hands. Have forensics
run a deluxe, will you? Thanks.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.574
- Just another one!
Y'all don't care about us!

02:53.607 --> 02:55.209
- Who is that?

02:55.243 --> 02:57.278
- It's Kenny Rixton.
He's Ruzek's replacement.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.480
- What?
- Ruzek's replacement.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.415
Look, I'll fill you in later.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.551
Do me a favor--get that
under control, will you?

03:03.584 --> 03:05.753
- It's all for show!
That's all it is! All of this!

03:05.786 --> 03:07.388
- Work the case.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.558
- They don't care about us.
It's all for show!

03:10.591 --> 03:12.560
All right? Look at this one.
Look at her.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.628
She about to come over here
and tell me to shut up.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.497
- Ma'am?
- I have the right to be here.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.533
- Yes, you do.
Did you know the girl?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.269
[man scoffs]

03:21.302 --> 03:23.804
I'm trying here.
What's your name?

03:23.837 --> 03:25.439
- My name is
"I'm black and I'm proud."

03:25.473 --> 03:26.340
What's your name?

03:26.374 --> 03:28.242
- Okay, my name is
Officer Kim Burgess,

03:28.276 --> 03:29.710
and this is a crime scene,

03:29.743 --> 03:31.979
so if you know something and you
can help us in some way--

03:32.012 --> 03:34.282
- Help you?
They are killing our daughters,

03:34.315 --> 03:35.716
and you're asking me
for my help?

03:35.749 --> 03:37.017
You're the police!
- Ma'am, I need you to calm--

03:37.050 --> 03:38.819
- No--you're supposed
to be helping us!

03:38.852 --> 03:40.421
No! Don't touch me!

03:40.454 --> 03:42.523
This snowflake white bitch
don't care about you!

03:42.556 --> 03:44.592
- Officer, stand down! Hey!
Holster your Tazer!

03:44.625 --> 03:45.726
- What you gonna do?
- Ma'am!

03:45.759 --> 03:47.828
- You gonna shoot me?
- Ma'am, you need to calm down.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.664
Do you hear me?
Holster your Tazer!

03:52.333 --> 03:53.401
And you, walk away.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.468
I need you to walk away.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.003
Take your friend
and walk her away,

03:56.036 --> 03:58.339
or you are sleeping in lock-up.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.808
- Don't touch me.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.711
- Come here.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.379
Do you know her?
Is she related to the victim

04:05.413 --> 04:06.447
in some way?

04:06.480 --> 04:07.481
What was that?

04:07.515 --> 04:08.849
- Deanna Lewis.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.285
Her niece was killed
a few months ago.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.487
- They're killing our daughters!

04:13.521 --> 04:15.523
What are you gonna do about it?

04:27.635 --> 04:27.735
.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.201
- Ruzek's replacement?

04:30.438 --> 04:32.005
- That's all we heard.

04:32.039 --> 04:36.877
Hey, um, how'd it go
with your dad?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.980
- Um, fine.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.650
I-I don't know.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.785
I don't even know
if I want this in my life.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.988
- Do you want me to dig in?
Go through his financials,

04:48.021 --> 04:50.658
see if he's got a reason to be
coming out of the woodwork?

04:50.691 --> 04:52.726
- No.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.570
- Okay, this is Kenny Rixton.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.538
He's assigned
over from the gang unit.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.039
He and I used to
work together over there.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.009
- Where's Adam?

05:09.042 --> 05:11.445
- Ruzek's been detailed
to an undercover assignment

05:11.479 --> 05:12.646
at his request.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.982
I don't know what the case is.
I don't know for how long.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.686
Kevin, you and Kenny
are gonna partner up.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.953
He's up to speed on the case.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.022
- Hey, welcome aboard.
- Welcome.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.592
- Looking forward
to working with you all.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.526
- Hit it.

05:25.559 --> 05:29.430
- Okay, so, Grace Johnson,
22 years old.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.900
She was found dead last night
based on an anonymous 911 call.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.702
The caller did not want
to be ID'd.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.671
His phone was a dead end,
and as of right now,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.707
we haven't been able to turn up
any witnesses.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.709
- It was 28 degrees out
last night.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.876
Hard to determine time of death.

05:42.910 --> 05:43.977
We're trying to locate a vehicle

05:44.011 --> 05:45.846
that would've dropped her off
where she was found.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.615
- Well, the ME noted
vaginal tearing,

05:47.648 --> 05:50.451
signs of asphyxiation,
and three gunshot wounds.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.553
- And no arterial bleeding,

05:52.586 --> 05:55.723
meaning she was raped
postmortem.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.493
- Who was she?

05:59.527 --> 06:02.863
- Yeah, uh,
Grace was a hard worker,

06:02.896 --> 06:04.865
receptionist at a doctor's
office in the South Loop,

06:04.898 --> 06:06.500
raising two younger sisters.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.601
Mom's MIA.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.903
Dad got knifed in the day room
at Stateville last year.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.739
Sisters are with DCFS now.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.807
- Those sisters need
to be interviewed.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.477
I want to understand
the last day of Grace's life.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.545
Every minute.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.547
Check all sex offenders
in the area.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.881
Comb her social media.
Dump her phone.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.049
Let's go.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.657
- Thank you.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.825
- So you'll cool
with questioning kids?

06:31.859 --> 06:34.094
- Yeah.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.064
In the gang unit, half the
bangers we dealt with were kids.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.803
- How you doing, ladies?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.573
I'm Officer Atwater.
This is Officer Rixton.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.074
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.909
- Kimmy and Devon, right?

06:48.942 --> 06:51.044
- Hi.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.614
- Devon, you think
you might want a snack?

06:53.647 --> 06:55.649
- Whatever you want, on me.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.718
You know where the machines are?
- Uh-huh.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.921
- Um...

07:04.091 --> 07:07.861
So, Kimmy, I feel terrible about
what happened to your sister,

07:07.895 --> 07:09.062
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.931
I'm gonna have to ask you
a few questions

07:10.964 --> 07:12.933
if you think
you're ready for that.

07:12.966 --> 07:16.670
- Ask what you got to ask.

07:16.704 --> 07:20.173
- So, did Grace come home
last night after work?

07:20.207 --> 07:23.744
- She went out to see Vincent.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.012
- Vincent.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.947
Didn't see that name
in her phone.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.116
- She got a different phone
for Vincent.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.019
He's this white boy.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.055
I know everybody loves Grace,
and she got a job and all that,

07:35.088 --> 07:38.726
but I know what
she does on weekends.

07:38.759 --> 07:43.731
Dances for Vincent
at some club.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.165
- You mean like a--

07:45.198 --> 07:46.967
- Not a strip club.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.702
Lingerie parties.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.004
Girls at school do it.

07:51.038 --> 07:54.842
Dance, take a guy
in back for 100.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.578
But they don't dance
for Vincent.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.913
Only Grace does.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.783
He's...fancy.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.152
- Hm.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.220
- That's all I know.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.859
They said she was raped.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.200
- I don't know.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.204
- Thought you weren't
gonna lie to me.

08:26.173 --> 08:30.911
You know, our dad got killed.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.980
I didn't cry then either.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.886
[dance music]

08:39.919 --> 08:43.991
*

08:44.024 --> 08:45.826
- Hey, hey.
CPD.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.260
We're looking
for a Vincent Avinell.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.262
Vince Avinell.

08:49.296 --> 08:55.703
*

08:55.736 --> 08:56.770
- Vincent Avinell?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.171
- Hey, CPD.
Vincent Avinell?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.708
- Where's Vincent?
- Can't come in here.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.875
[grunts]

09:01.909 --> 09:03.043
- Okay.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.780
Chicago PD!
Hey, ladies, get down.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.048
- Get off the bed.
Get off the bed.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.683
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.051
Don't move. Vincent Avinell?
- No.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.152
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.921
- Two-way mirror.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.188
- Don't you move.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.058
- Chicago PD! Don't move!

09:18.091 --> 09:19.893
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

09:19.927 --> 09:20.928
What's up, Vincent?

09:20.961 --> 09:21.962
- Those ain't mine.
- Yeah?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.064
Maybe we'll hold onto them.
What do you think?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.234
You got him?
- Yeah.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.070
- The problem is, Vincent,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.972
is that we know
she danced for you

09:32.005 --> 09:33.206
right before this happened.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.808
- Yo, like I did that?

09:34.842 --> 09:36.176
Yo--I was at a bar all night.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.145
I got, like, a dozen dudes
that would vouch for me.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.781
- But you did see Grace
last night?

09:40.814 --> 09:43.283
- Yeah. She came by.
She owed me some money.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.953
Yo, I'm being forthcoming,
so y'all can't come at me

09:45.986 --> 09:47.454
with obstruction charges.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.694
- Just drop the street act,
Vince, okay?

09:53.727 --> 09:56.296
You're from Winnetka.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.732
Sit.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.105
- Who did she talk to
and who did she leave with?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.740
- No one.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.175
She kept it moving.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.143
All the dudes were into her.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.979
- You know, I can put you
in lock-up right now

10:12.012 --> 10:14.114
for those guns.
- [scoffs]

10:14.147 --> 10:17.751
- Rubbing elbows with a bunch
of guys who may not understand

10:17.785 --> 10:20.854
the appeal of white boys
selling black women.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.763
It's time to get on the bus
or get under it, kid.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.301
- Okay.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.171
Dude's name is Ricky Barnes.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.342
I might've sent some stuff
to him on text.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.745
You know,
that's why I had the guns--

10:44.778 --> 10:46.079
in case he found me.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.748
- Who's Ricky Barnes?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.817
- He used to go home
with Grace.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.185
He was pissed that
Grace was dancing for me.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.154
He made some threats.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.991
Grace went over there to try
to cool things down, but...

10:58.025 --> 11:00.060
I think he killed her.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.396
And I'm next.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.834
- Ricky Barnes, 27.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.902
He's been arrested,
but no charges as an adult.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.304
He was a violent kid, in and out
of the juvenile system.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.305
No current address.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.207
Accurint puts
his last two arrests

11:14.241 --> 11:15.375
at his parents' house.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.010
- Mom and dad live two blocks

11:17.044 --> 11:19.046
from where Grace was dumped.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.214
Dad's a machinist,
and mom works back office

11:21.248 --> 11:22.315
for [indistinct].

11:22.349 --> 11:23.851
- You and Jay hit it.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.018
- Um--

11:28.055 --> 11:30.791
Yeah, okay, so, one thing.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.325
Two recent murders
on the south side.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.928
Victims choked, shot,
then raped.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.063
- Uh-huh.
- It's a pattern.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.799
Woman at the tape line put me
onto it--Deanna Lewis.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.067
Her niece is one of the girls.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.401
- If it was,
Homicide would've known.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.970
- Could've fallen
through the cracks.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.805
They are overloaded,
as we all know.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.206
- Chase it down.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.975
- Okay.

11:52.012 --> 11:55.916
- You want to arrest our son
off of some text messages?

11:55.949 --> 11:59.019
- He made threats.
And we can't find him.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.287
We just want to get him
off the street

12:00.320 --> 12:01.955
before anything else happens.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.224
- Jeanette, does he have a gun?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.358
- Franklin, does he?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.961
- I don't know.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.362
You tried his friends?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.031
Those young men
are always strapped.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.833
- Officers are looking
for his friends now.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.036
- Well, I'll reach out,
but Ricky didn't make it home.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.438
He's pretty upset about Grace.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.074
- Do you mind
if we search his room?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.175
- I do mind.

12:22.209 --> 12:25.012
If you want to talk to him,
I'll try and make it work,

12:25.045 --> 12:26.246
but this is our home.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.048
- Sir, if I may--

12:28.081 --> 12:30.250
help us out here, okay?

12:30.283 --> 12:33.086
Grace was murdered.
You knew her.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.454
She probably stood right there
where you're standing

12:34.487 --> 12:35.989
at one point,

12:36.023 --> 12:38.125
and what happened to her is
as bad as it gets.

12:38.158 --> 12:42.930
- You don't think my baby
killed that girl?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.364
- No.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.266
But we think he might know
who did.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.201
And the longer he stays
out there,

12:48.235 --> 12:50.938
the more he does begin to look
like a suspect.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.508
- I let you in here,
but you need a warrant

12:55.542 --> 12:57.010
if you're gonna search my house.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.379
- Ms. Lewis,
we're not here to search.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.914
We need your help.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.415
Something is going on.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.217
We just need to figure out what.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.420
- What's going on is

13:07.454 --> 13:10.157
that my niece was killed
six months ago.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.125
The coroner's reports show

13:12.159 --> 13:15.095
that her body was defiled
after she was deceased.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.167
This is Belle.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.035
She was 19 years old.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.237
My sister can't hardly
leave the house.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.140
- She's beautiful.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.976
- She was...

13:29.009 --> 13:30.978
the best thing that's happened
to this family,

13:31.011 --> 13:32.179
and I intend to get her justice.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.181
- And that's why we're here.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.449
You said "They're killing
our daughters."

13:36.483 --> 13:37.985
What do you mean by that?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.186
- [shaky breathing]

13:39.219 --> 13:41.421
Stay here.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.990
- How'd you find her?

13:43.023 --> 13:45.058
- She found us.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.194
Should've tried harder
to talk to her the first time.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.332
- Three white girls are killed
in Lincoln Park.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.201
It's national news.

13:54.234 --> 13:59.039
A killer comes back to haunt
black girls in Englewood--

13:59.072 --> 14:01.374
one, two, three, four, five,

14:01.408 --> 14:05.378
six, seven, eight, nine, ten--

14:05.412 --> 14:07.447
and they call me crazy.

14:16.456 --> 14:16.589
.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.424
- So, Deanna Lewis's
niece gets killed.

14:17.925 --> 14:18.892
She starts digging.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.061
- And finds ten murders in 2008
just like Grace.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.595
- So far, everything
she gave us checks out.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.932
Victims are strangled,
shot with a .25,

14:24.965 --> 14:25.966
raped postmortem.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.168
- And all ten of those murders
have gone unsolved.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.002
- So, you're thinking
the same guy

14:29.036 --> 14:31.371
all of a sudden
is killing again?

14:31.404 --> 14:33.941
Okay, so, why did he stop,
and why did he start up again?

14:33.974 --> 14:35.475
- Both good questions.
- In 2008,

14:35.508 --> 14:37.544
homicide didn't call
these serial killings.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.947
Chicago had a bid in
to host the Olympics.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.581
Maybe HQ buried this.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.951
- If they did,
are we stepping on toes

14:43.984 --> 14:45.152
reopening these investigations?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.454
- Don't worry about that.
- I need to talk to Chilewich

14:47.487 --> 14:50.157
over in Area South Homicide.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.659
This is really good work, guys.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.394
- Thank you, Sergeant.

14:58.198 --> 15:02.069
- No, the correct response
is "Team effort."

15:02.102 --> 15:03.971
All right?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.473
- Yeah, no, I wasn't trying
to take all the credit.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.541
- All right.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.182
- When did that happen?

15:15.215 --> 15:16.984
What--ten minutes ago?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.685
I can't now.
I got to meet someone.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.653
Yeah, send Rico.
All right.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.955
Yeah. Look, I got to go.

15:21.989 --> 15:22.990
All right.
Call me later. Bye.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.958
- Hey, Arnold.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.660
Listen, I don't want your job--
this just fell in our lap.

15:27.694 --> 15:31.564
- Oh, yeah?
You can have my job.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.200
March 3, 2008.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.667
Cindy Howard.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.703
Agreed, she matches
your murder pretty close.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.672
- That's one of ten.
You see a pattern?

15:39.706 --> 15:40.673
- You thinking
this is the same guy

15:40.707 --> 15:42.042
that did more of these in 2008?

15:42.075 --> 15:42.976
- I don't know yet.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.045
I'd like to compare
your ballistics to mine.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.679
- You want to take
all these open homicides?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.581
- I just want to stop girls
from getting killed.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.183
- [sighs]

15:50.217 --> 15:52.185
The ballistics--
I don't have them.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.587
I know how that sounds.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.224
We lost six years worth
of files.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.691
Our offices got moved
across town,

15:58.725 --> 16:01.194
and then there was
a software update.

16:01.228 --> 16:04.164
- You make any arrests in 2008?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.565
- Yes, I did, Hank.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.101
One blew up on us.
Walter Volman.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.736
- The reporter
with "The Sun Times"?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.471
- [chuckles]
Yeah, until we found him

16:11.504 --> 16:13.106
in his car smoking rocks
with a pro.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.774
Claimed she was a source.
- Yeah.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.276
- I said,
"Where's your pants, then?"

16:16.309 --> 16:17.744
[both laugh]

16:17.777 --> 16:19.179
Yeah, he was working a story
at the time--

16:19.212 --> 16:21.014
young girls getting killed.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.649
Always at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.618
We cleared him.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.587
Could be worth another look.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.060
[rings doorbell]

16:34.094 --> 16:37.097
- Hang back on this guy.
Okay?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.634
Walter Volman.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.772
- Are you here
about the girls, Al?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.720
Believe this?

17:00.753 --> 17:02.322
Working from home now.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.090
I'm a blogger.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.492
Ugly word.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.560
Should've never took that buyout
from "The Times."

17:07.594 --> 17:12.232
- Yeah. Didn't help you were
a suspect in ten murders.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.601
- I never hurt a fly,

17:14.634 --> 17:17.604
as my lawyer showed.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.637
Cocktail?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.240
- I'm on the clock.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.708
- So, we'll have gin.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.347
- We're here about your files
for the 2008 murders.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.119
- Sorry.
This is Patrolman Kim Burgess.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.154
- You assume I kept those files.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.123
I was close, you know.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.625
I was the only one who cared.
I liked those girls.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.792
- Liked them too much, maybe.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.296
- Yeah, so, why help CPD now?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.165
- Helps prove your theory.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.706
- [exhales]

17:53.740 --> 17:57.177
Ten murders, and nobody ever
saw this guy, right?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.245
- Mm-hmm.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.614
- Chatter was he raped a girl
but she got away.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.616
Never reported.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.353
I was this close
to finding her.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.654
It's in my files.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.757
- Oh, see, I knew we came all
the way over here for a reason.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.862
- I identified 40 missing girls
in Englewood back then, 40.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.265
You keep digging, you're gonna
turn up more bodies.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.133
I could help.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.401
I know those streets.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.370
- You already have.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.238
I'll wait here

18:25.272 --> 18:27.207
while you go grab those files.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.681
- You seem real nice.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.749
Not sure what you're doing
with him.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.158
- So, we're trying to link
this killer

18:45.192 --> 18:47.294
from the 2008 murders
in green...

18:47.327 --> 18:49.162
- Right.
- To the recent killings in red

18:49.196 --> 18:50.597
to include Grace Johnson.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.732
- We lost the ballistics
from 2008 to compare

18:52.765 --> 18:53.866
to these fresh murders.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.703
- Right, but we do have physical
DNA evidence in storage.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.372
The problem is our offender
isn't in a DNA database.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.442
So, we spoke to Antonio.
He had a great idea.

19:02.475 --> 19:06.646
You widen the DNA search
to include familial matches,

19:06.679 --> 19:08.448
and then you search every felon
in the state.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.251
- So, you're thinking our guy is
smart and never got pinched,

19:11.284 --> 19:13.286
but somebody in his family
might have been?

19:13.320 --> 19:15.688
- That's the theory.
The problem is: to do the sweep,

19:15.722 --> 19:16.589
you got to petition a judge;

19:16.623 --> 19:18.891
to get a judge,
we need a prosecutor.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.860
- A familial DNA sweep?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.762
That's half science fiction,

19:22.795 --> 19:24.464
and a good defense attorney
could shred you with it.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.732
- It's the only way to ID him.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.935
We got a DNA match from the cold
cases and the recent murders.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.404
It's the same guy, but whoever
he is, he's not on file.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.640
- You want to build
a serial killer case

19:33.673 --> 19:36.943
off homemade evidence
walked in by a civilian?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.378
And where's our suspect?

19:38.411 --> 19:39.912
- Ricky Barnes is still
a possible.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.248
He was in Grace's life,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.749
but we're still connecting
the dots.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.916
- Can you put him
near Grace's body?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.852
- Not yet. She was with him
the night she was killed.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.288
Her cell phone puts her there.
But that's it.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.456
- Where is he?

19:49.489 --> 19:50.757
- We're looking.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.493
Meantime, I want that DNA sweep.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.862
I got 13 families
denied justice.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.464
You want to stand in their way?

20:03.703 --> 20:04.804
- Hey, Sarge.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.273
- Hey.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.975
- Hey, I don't know
if you heard, but--

20:09.008 --> 20:10.009
- I probably heard.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.278
- You didn't let me finish.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.413
- Finish.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.747
- Adam took an undercover gig.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.449
- I heard.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.350
- I went by his place.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.319
I called him.
They turned off his service.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.788
And his stuff is just cleared
out of his apartment.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.523
- Must be a deep-cover gig.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.358
- I mean, I get it.
You don't say no when they call.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.328
But it's just--
it's weird not knowing

20:28.361 --> 20:31.298
how long he'll be gone, right?

20:31.331 --> 20:34.267
- You're worried he left
to get away from you.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.470
- Yeah.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.907
- Kim, Adam made his decision
of sound mind and body.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.442
You need to make yours:

20:42.475 --> 20:44.344
member of
this Intelligence Unit

20:44.377 --> 20:47.380
or mother hen?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.982
- Hi. We're looking
for Detective Lindsay.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.818
She'd like to speak with Ricky.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.755
- That's right.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.459
- Hey, would you put your hands
on the counter for me, please?

20:59.492 --> 21:00.460
- What?

21:00.493 --> 21:01.894
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.330
No, no, no, no.
He didn't do anything.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.931
- I thought y'all was trying
to keep me safe!

21:04.964 --> 21:06.833
- Get your hands off of him!
He didn't do anything!

21:06.866 --> 21:09.336
Get your hands off of him!
He didn't do anything.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.070
- I understand, ma'am, and we're
gonna find that out, aren't we?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.939
- Ricky!
- Why'd you lie to me?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.407
- Ricky, I'm so sorry.
- You lied!

21:24.651 --> 21:24.784
.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.618
- We know
about the threats you made,

21:26.686 --> 21:28.621
in case you're wondering,
"What am I doing here?"

21:28.655 --> 21:31.424
- You want to tell us
about Vincent Avinell?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.592
- Nothing to say about him.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.627
- He's scared of you.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.697
Guess you two had a beef
over Grace Johnson?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.699
- You have every right
to be mad at him--

21:39.732 --> 21:41.401
what he did.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.802
He had her turning tricks.

21:42.835 --> 21:43.970
- What did you say?

21:44.003 --> 21:46.473
- Relax.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.713
Kid...

21:53.746 --> 21:56.649
you got a big problem.

21:56.683 --> 22:00.487
I can put Grace in your bedroom
three nights ago.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.589
Her cell phone records.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.725
Ricky, just tell us
what happened.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.494
- I ain't seen Grace
in a minute.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.929
- Ricky, what happened?
You argue?

22:09.962 --> 22:12.632
- Look. For real,
I did not see her.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.767
Okay? I loved her.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.469
She broke my heart.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.773
I heard she got killed,

22:20.807 --> 22:22.775
and I was gonna do
something about it,

22:22.809 --> 22:24.511
but I didn't.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.380
So, all you got on me is
some lame texts

22:27.414 --> 22:28.648
I sent to the dude,

22:28.681 --> 22:30.617
so if you want to arrest me
on that, do it.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.685
- Where's the gun, Ricky?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.388
We know you saw her.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.889
What, you follow her home
from the club?

22:38.825 --> 22:41.461
Where's your car?
Where's the gun?

22:41.494 --> 22:44.797
- Like I said,
you got bad information.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.833
[knocking at door]

22:54.641 --> 22:56.543
- The state is charging
Ricky Barnes.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.410
- [scoffs]

22:57.444 --> 23:00.513
- He hit on the DNA sweep.
98% match

23:00.547 --> 23:02.749
on all ten cold case murders
plus the new ones.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.050
- Hold on.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.918
This kid's not even
under arrest yet.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.854
- His DNA was logged
when he got grabbed with a gun

23:07.887 --> 23:08.755
three years ago.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.524
No charges filed,
but that's what hit

23:11.558 --> 23:14.727
when we widened the parameters
of the DNA search.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.796
I've been instructed.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.635
Stand up. Up.
- For what?

23:22.669 --> 23:23.936
- Hands behind your back.

23:23.970 --> 23:27.574
Ricky Barnes, you are
under arrest for 13 murders...

23:27.607 --> 23:28.575
- What?
- Including Grace Jones.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.477
- Look, I didn't kill anybody!
- You are entitled

23:30.510 --> 23:31.678
to an attorney.
- I'm innocent!

23:31.711 --> 23:33.580
- What, this kid was
16 years old

23:33.613 --> 23:35.482
when he did his first murder?

23:39.486 --> 23:40.853
You caught him?
Please tell me you caught him.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.022
- We can't discuss
an ongoing case.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.024
- These people--
look at them.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.493
They've all lost someone.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.860
They deserve to know
what's going on.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.896
- Ma'am, please know
that we took everything

23:49.929 --> 23:52.532
that you told us very seriously,

23:52.565 --> 23:55.602
and our entire unit
is focused on this.

23:55.635 --> 23:56.603
- You promised me results.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.839
- Ms. Lewis, I didn't say--
I did not say that.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.974
Look, all we can do is
we work a case,

24:02.008 --> 24:03.042
we go where it takes us.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.811
Please let us do that.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.681
- I'm trusting you.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.983
All of us--
we're trusting you.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.721
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.960
- This handgun was recovered

24:20.993 --> 24:23.630
from underneath the carpet
lining of Ricky Barnes' trunk.

24:23.663 --> 24:24.897
- Preliminary ballistics are
a match.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.934
That .25 hit
on all three recent murders.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.803
- Thing is, if we lost
the ballistics from 2008,

24:30.837 --> 24:33.139
we still can't tie Ricky Barnes
to those bodies.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.741
- We got the gun.
We got DNA.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.976
- I'd just like it better
if the DNA was 100%.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.878
- No, see, I think
we may have something.

24:38.911 --> 24:42.148
Now, Walter Volman had some
notes on a girl back in '08.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.015
A witness.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.884
- Yeah? Did she actually
see the murders?

24:44.917 --> 24:47.520
- No. She was raped
and shot in the chest,

24:47.554 --> 24:48.921
but somehow she lived.

24:48.955 --> 24:49.856
So the story goes.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.924
- But all we have is
her nickname, Cherry,

24:51.958 --> 24:53.025
and this was eight years ago.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.927
- Well, if she's the only one
who can tie Ricky Barnes

24:54.961 --> 24:57.029
to one of these crime scenes,

24:57.063 --> 24:58.665
find her.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.802
- I'm looking for a girl.
A prostitute.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.136
We got a street name,
but we struck out

25:04.170 --> 25:05.738
in the nickname database.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.607
- Nice to see you, too, Jay.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.809
- Oh, sorry.
Virginia, you look great.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.010
Is that a new scent?

25:11.043 --> 25:14.547
- Yeah. My sugar daddy gave it
to me on his private jet.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.782
What's the girl's name?

25:15.815 --> 25:17.950
- Cherry. Last seen 2008.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.686
Probably gonna be
a hospital report.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.853
She was assaulted.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.622
- Nothing.
Um,

25:22.655 --> 25:24.591
let me try the juvenile system.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.695
Okay.
Sienna Brody, AKA Cherry.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.129
Multiple pops for solicitation.

25:30.162 --> 25:34.767
Admitted to Med August 2008.
Two GSWs.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.836
She was 15.
Want me to print this?

25:36.869 --> 25:39.005
- Yeah. Thanks.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.907
And, uh, one more name.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.675
Jimmy Sanguinetti.

25:44.076 --> 25:47.680
- Mr. Sanguinetti,
another frequent flyer.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.181
He did this to her?

25:49.215 --> 25:52.151
- Uh...no.
Unrelated.

25:56.155 --> 25:59.859
- Detective, I can't chase
personal business

25:59.892 --> 26:02.061
without a case number assigned.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.900
Bit-O-Honey.
How'd you know?

26:07.934 --> 26:10.169
- Friends know, Virginia.
Friends know.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.741
- Mm-hmm.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.209
Well, I can have these delivered
to you, uh,

26:17.243 --> 26:19.045
Friday, if that works.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.081
One moment.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.917
- Sienna Brody?

26:27.787 --> 26:29.822
- [crying]

26:32.759 --> 26:34.160
I don't think about that day.

26:37.029 --> 26:40.066
I don't read the news.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.035
I got two sons with my husband

26:43.069 --> 26:45.938
from his first marriage.

26:45.972 --> 26:50.176
And I never came forward before
because--

26:50.209 --> 26:53.079
'cause I couldn't sit there
in front of a jury and tell them

26:53.112 --> 26:56.816
how I was so high
I didn't even see the gun.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.954
I was 15.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.092
Now because of that,
I can't have kids of my own.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.997
- We're very sorry.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.799
Um...

27:12.832 --> 27:14.934
but we'd like for you
to look at some photos.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.871
Can you let us know
if you see him?

27:23.910 --> 27:25.945
- None of these
are right either.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.817
- Okay.

27:30.850 --> 27:34.320
Um, just have a few more
to look through.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.063
- [breathing heavily]

27:44.096 --> 27:46.198
That's him.

27:57.443 --> 27:57.944
.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.145
- All the girls on that corner--
we knew what the police didn't.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.017
Someone was picking us off.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.255
He wanted pictures.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.190
That's him.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.095
- Why'd he let you go?
I mean, how are you different

28:16.128 --> 28:17.997
from the other girls?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.066
- He didn't let me go.

28:21.333 --> 28:25.404
He drove me to some garage.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.040
He shot me.
Twice.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.411
I blacked out,

28:32.444 --> 28:34.513
woke up,

28:34.546 --> 28:36.348
and he was still on me.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.720
I laid there
and I played dead.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.126
He left me to die
in an alley.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.933
[footsteps approaching]

28:55.334 --> 28:57.536
- Nothing.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.971
His wife hasn't seen him.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.473
His phone hasn't
moved in 12 hours.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.042
He's running.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.310
- All right, call Kot.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.112
Get a search warrant
for his house.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.114
We need a solid DNA sample.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.181
Do a garbage pull.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.316
Anything and everything.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.417
- We also need
to get Ricky Barnes

29:11.450 --> 29:12.318
out of 26th and Cal.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.253
He might know
where his dad's hiding.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.023
- Just make sure
you do it quietly.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.259
- I should've done this
a long time ago.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.928
- Hey.
- It's my fault

29:21.961 --> 29:23.362
that these girls are dead.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.532
- Listen to me.
You can't blame yourself.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.034
Okay?

29:28.067 --> 29:30.536
We're gonna find this guy
because of you.

29:30.569 --> 29:33.205
You hear me?

29:33.239 --> 29:36.075
- Ms. Barnes, do you know where
your husband might be right now?

29:36.108 --> 29:38.210
Does he disappear often?

29:38.244 --> 29:41.380
- Sometimes it's a day.
Sometimes more.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.182
I don't know where he goes.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.154
- Is your husband the only one
that drinks these?

29:50.389 --> 29:51.991
- Yes.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.092
- Office.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.394
All right, we'll clear
everything up real soon, ma'am.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.999
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.233
- [sighs]

30:02.501 --> 30:05.104
- We're missing something.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.007
- Yeah?
- Let's step outside.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.379
Grace Johnson comes here
the night of her murder.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.446
Her cell phone doesn't lie.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.116
- Yeah. To talk
to her ex-boyfriend.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.119
- Yeah, but he's not here,

30:20.152 --> 30:23.622
so she runs into his dad,

30:23.655 --> 30:26.058
Franklin Barnes.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.459
Thing is there's
no sign of her inside.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.460
There's no prints.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.528
- Could've wiped it down

30:29.561 --> 30:31.230
and planted his gun
in Ricky's car.

30:31.263 --> 30:32.831
- Yeah.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.437
Or she never made it
inside the house.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.467
[hollow knock]

31:11.270 --> 31:14.306
[hollow knocking]

31:34.326 --> 31:36.662
- I got blood.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.331
- [sighs]
I got a photo.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.138
- [sighs]

31:46.172 --> 31:47.473
- Wherever he is,

31:47.506 --> 31:49.341
looks like he's getting rid
of evidence.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.379
- Your dad kills
more than a dozen girls.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.647
How much would you know?

31:55.681 --> 31:57.349
- I'm the wrong person to ask.

31:57.383 --> 32:00.386
Until a week ago,
I thought my dad was in prison.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.288
- They lived under
the same roof.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.223
- Well, you can hide a lot
if you try.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.492
Just ask Bunny.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.566
Ricky, we think that the reason

32:14.600 --> 32:16.602
that your DNA was
a false positive

32:16.635 --> 32:19.438
is 'cause you're
such a close match to your dad.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.510
Do you understand
what I'm getting at here?

32:24.543 --> 32:27.146
- No.
My dad?

32:27.179 --> 32:30.582
- Come on, Ricky.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.752
I am telling you--
we are telling you

32:33.785 --> 32:36.188
that your father killed
13 girls.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.389
You didn't see anything?

32:37.423 --> 32:38.757
You didn't know anything?

32:38.790 --> 32:41.693
- Look. Ten minutes ago,
it was me locked up.

32:41.727 --> 32:46.398
Now you say--now you think
my dad did this?

32:46.432 --> 32:48.734
- Ricky, you loved her.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.270
You loved her, right?

32:51.303 --> 32:53.672
You loved her,
and he raped her.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.341
And he killed her.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.676
Your dad did that,
and then he set you up

32:57.709 --> 32:59.745
so you'd go for the ride.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.647
Help us out. Where is he?
Where would he go?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.350
- [crying]
I don't know!

33:04.383 --> 33:06.552
I don't know what you're saying.
I don't know.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.188
I don't know.
[crying]

33:09.221 --> 33:12.224
- Ricky.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.360
I know this is a lot.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.298
If your dad were nervous,

33:19.331 --> 33:22.168
if he were gonna
hide out somewhere,

33:22.201 --> 33:25.537
where would he go?

33:25.571 --> 33:26.672
- [shaky breathing]

33:26.705 --> 33:29.508
- Come on, man,
where would he go?

33:29.541 --> 33:32.311
- My uncle's.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.481
Not my blood uncle.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.783
He's got a shop.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.686
They drink there.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.588
He's got a key.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.604
- You guys go.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.472
You're with me.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.297
- Franklin Barnes.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.302
- Turn around, Franklin.

34:30.335 --> 34:31.570
Nice and slow.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.806
That'a boy.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.542
Down on your knees.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.347
[handcuffs click]

34:49.455 --> 34:50.688
Stand him up.

35:03.302 --> 35:03.602
.

35:03.635 --> 35:04.370
- Why'd you stop?

35:08.940 --> 35:11.710
- I don't understand
the question.

35:11.743 --> 35:15.547
- Ten murders in 2008,
and then you stopped.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.918
Why'd you stop killing
and then start again?

35:19.951 --> 35:23.255
- I think you have me confused
with someone else.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.658
- You know,
you sound like the 911 caller

35:26.692 --> 35:28.194
who spotted Grace Johnson.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.895
Did you call in
your own crime scene?

35:29.928 --> 35:32.198
- Well, that wouldn't be
very intelligent.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.900
- And you're an intelligent guy.

35:34.933 --> 35:37.869
Except you left your DNA
on 13 girls.

35:39.371 --> 35:42.140
We got your saliva
on their breasts.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.578
Tell me something.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.580
What kind of man
lets his own son

35:48.614 --> 35:50.649
take the fall
for this kind of thing?

35:53.652 --> 35:56.222
- Well,

35:56.255 --> 35:59.758
this is all just some big
misunderstanding.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.831
He'll get over it.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.605
That guy you're looking for--

36:13.639 --> 36:16.875
I think I've met him.
- Hmm?

36:16.908 --> 36:19.311
- A long time ago,

36:19.345 --> 36:24.350
he sat down next to me
at the bar

36:24.383 --> 36:28.654
and had some wild stories

36:28.687 --> 36:33.325
about how he tricked girls
into his car

36:33.359 --> 36:35.361
for nothing.

36:37.363 --> 36:40.332
Five bucks.

36:40.366 --> 36:43.802
Some loose cigarettes.

36:43.835 --> 36:47.639
He gave me those pictures
you found.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.809
Mm-hmm.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.912
Sick.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.714
Never got his name.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.384
- What did he look like--
this guy?

36:58.417 --> 37:00.786
- He was big.

37:03.489 --> 37:07.293
The kind of guy--

37:07.326 --> 37:09.728
you just walk right by him.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.003
Said he killed 100 girls.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.809
Must be some kind of record.

37:37.523 --> 37:40.826
- I'm not gonna lay a hand
on you,

37:40.859 --> 37:43.061
'cause I don't want to--

37:43.094 --> 37:48.066
I don't want to jeopardize
my case, but...

37:48.099 --> 37:52.003
believe me: where you're going--
and you're going there forever--

37:55.841 --> 37:58.310
It's gonna be hell.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.980
Hell.

38:03.815 --> 38:07.386
I'm gonna make sure of it.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.429
- [crying]

38:17.463 --> 38:19.831
I--I didn't know.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.368
I didn't know.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.102
I'm so sorry.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.538
[crying]

38:27.506 --> 38:28.974
- We have a side door. Come on.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.843
There's too much press
out front.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.845
- On behalf of the
Chicago Police Department,

38:33.879 --> 38:36.482
I would like to thank you.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.384
And if you can take
some comfort in that,

38:38.417 --> 38:40.819
I would be so happy.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.357
- Okay.
[crying]

39:05.043 --> 39:07.045
- See you tomorrow.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.480
- Yeah.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.015
Hey, nice job today.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.384
- Oh. Uh...

39:12.418 --> 39:14.453
team effort.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.023
- Olinsky bust your balls?

39:18.056 --> 39:20.091
- Yeah, a little.

39:20.125 --> 39:24.896
But you won't see me make
the same mistake twice.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.432
- Good to know.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.500
Have a good night.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.001
- Good night.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.003
- See you, man.
- All right.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.107
- You want to hear
some good news?

39:36.141 --> 39:37.909
- Yes.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.078
- Jimmy Sanguinetti is a solid,

39:40.111 --> 39:42.080
financially stable,

39:42.113 --> 39:45.083
charitable individual.

39:45.116 --> 39:48.086
- You ran his financials
even though I asked you not to?

39:48.119 --> 39:50.188
- Pretty much.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.623
Now we know
whatever he's here for,

39:51.657 --> 39:53.859
he's not looking for a handout.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.162
- You seem very interested.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.465
- To figure out
where you came from?

39:59.498 --> 40:01.467
Sure.

40:03.001 --> 40:06.071
- Well, since you're all in,
you want to have dinner tonight?

40:06.104 --> 40:08.907
Apparently Jimmy's buying.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.142
- I'll have the lobster.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.014
- You were getting older,

40:16.047 --> 40:19.485
and Jimmy was married.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.152
And we just couldn't keep up

40:21.186 --> 40:23.522
the "Jimmy as family friend"
thing, you know?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.591
So...

40:27.258 --> 40:29.227
- Uh, so I heard
there was a mix-up

40:29.260 --> 40:30.929
at your mother's
storage facility

40:30.962 --> 40:32.898
and they auctioned
everything off.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.100
- I gave them
a forwarding address.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.568
It's not my fault.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.103
- Okay, well,

40:38.136 --> 40:41.072
I guess all your childhood
pictures were there,

40:41.106 --> 40:42.841
and those are all gone now.

40:42.874 --> 40:47.913
But I--I saved all the ones
your mom sent me

40:47.946 --> 40:49.481
over the years.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.984
I thought you might like this.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.259
- Wow.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.262
- I got them all in a--
in a binder.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.898
I'll bring them next time.

41:06.932 --> 41:10.869
Hey, we're, um--we're supposed
to be celebrating.

41:10.902 --> 41:15.173
Your mother and I are going
to buy that salon

41:15.206 --> 41:17.075
that she's been looking at.

41:17.108 --> 41:20.045
She's going to be a job creator.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.647
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.181
- Thank you, Jay.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.653
[sighs]
Well, I think it's time

41:27.686 --> 41:29.154
the old folks hit the bricks.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.989
- Oh.
- Yeah.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.625
It was great to see you,
sweetie.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.026
Bye.
- Jay.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.228
- Honey.
Mwah.

41:50.075 --> 41:52.644
- Just do me a favor.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.312
Let me run a DNA test on him

41:54.345 --> 41:56.648
just in case this whole thing
is a fantasy.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.751
- No.

41:59.785 --> 42:01.519
- No?

42:02.688 --> 42:06.992
- If it is a fantasy,
let me live in it for a minute.
