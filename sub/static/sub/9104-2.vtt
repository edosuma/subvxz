&lrm;You have one day to work
&lrm;on a fashion piece of your own design.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.400
&lrm;In ten hours, your presentation

00:36.520 --> 00:39.160
&lrm;will be judged
&lrm;by the great fashion designer

00:39.280 --> 00:43.440
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste,
&lrm;the father of our student Adrien.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.840
&lrm;Adrien will model the winning design.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.440
&lrm;And now, this year's theme: derby hats.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.320
&lrm;Derby hats?

00:56.160 --> 00:57.320
&lrm;[Marinette] Derby hat?

00:57.440 --> 01:00.040
&lrm;Derby hat? Derby hat?

01:00.160 --> 01:02.240
&lrm;I don't have any derby hat design.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.120
&lrm;I've got top hats, caps, two-horned hats.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.600
&lrm;A beret? I'm your girl.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.680
&lrm;A sombrero? No problemo. But a derby?

01:10.080 --> 01:13.560
&lrm;It won't even matter,
&lrm;I'll probably make a fool of myself,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.520
&lrm;trip on my derby, collapse on Mr. Agreste,

01:16.640 --> 01:19.000
&lrm;give him a concussion
&lrm;and Adrien will hate me.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.360
&lrm;I'll never be a great fashion designer.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.600
&lrm;My life is over!

01:23.960 --> 01:25.120
&lrm;For a derby hat?

01:25.480 --> 01:27.080
&lrm;Let me see your sketch pad.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.120
&lrm;There must be something in here.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.880
&lrm;Forget it, I'll probably mess
&lrm;everything up in the end.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.400
&lrm;[Adrien] Wow, Alya! Awesome designs.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.520
&lrm;I didn't know you had such skills.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.240
&lrm;Thanks, but I can't take the credit.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.720
&lrm;These sick designs belong to Marinette.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.920
&lrm;Off the chain, right?

01:44.400 --> 01:47.960
&lrm;You're super talented.
&lrm;You have a good chance of winning.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.080
&lrm;Well... um... yeah, I like designs that...

01:52.880 --> 01:54.400
&lrm;go upwards?

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
&lrm;[they gasp]

01:56.480 --> 01:57.800
&lrm;While stopping?

01:57.920 --> 02:00.440
&lrm;I mean... thanks?

02:00.920 --> 02:03.280
&lrm;Sure. Good luck, maybe I'll be wearing

02:03.400 --> 02:05.840
&lrm;your derby at father's next photo shoot.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.440
&lrm;You gotta get a grip next time.
&lrm;Did you hear?

02:10.800 --> 02:12.400
&lrm;He thinks you can win.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.560
&lrm;Did you hear how impressed Adrien was?

02:16.680 --> 02:17.760
&lrm;Of course I heard.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.520
&lrm;Her? Win the contest? As if.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.080
&lrm;Adrien will convince his father
&lrm;to award me the winner.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.680
&lrm;I'm sure he will, Chloe.
&lrm;You're a born champion.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.680
&lrm;Yours is sure to be the best.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.040
&lrm;Yeah, it is.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.400
&lrm;As soon as I can get my hands
&lrm;on this sketch pad.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.960
&lrm;[Alya] Nine hours until show time.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.520
&lrm;Yikes! I'm off to my secret garden
&lrm;of inspiration.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.480
&lrm;[groaning]

02:42.640 --> 02:44.160
&lrm;I'm okay, I'm okay.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.680
&lrm;[yelling]

02:49.960 --> 02:51.320
&lrm;The time has come for us

02:51.440 --> 02:54.200
&lrm;to find our next victim,
&lrm;my wicked little Akumas,

02:54.320 --> 02:57.080
&lrm;and to prey upon Ladybug and Cat Noir.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.040
&lrm;Their Miraculouses must be mine.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.200
&lrm;It's hard to be creative under pressure.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.520
&lrm;You save the world under pressure.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.960
&lrm;Designing a hat is a piece of cake.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.840
&lrm;A cake derby hat,

03:21.960 --> 03:23.440
&lrm;stylish and tasty.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.440
&lrm;[pigeons coo]

03:49.240 --> 03:50.480
&lrm;[cooing]

03:55.760 --> 03:58.120
&lrm;[Mr. Ramier] Happy day, happy day.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.720
&lrm;Splendid is the afternoon.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.440
&lrm;Edgar, you fancy one.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.080
&lrm;Fantastic. Dazzling performance.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.480
&lrm;Scram, winged rats.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.840
&lrm;How many times do you need
&lrm;to be told Mr. Ramier?

04:09.960 --> 04:12.120
&lrm;No... feeding... the pigeons!

04:12.240 --> 04:13.200
&lrm;It's forbidden.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.000
&lrm;They'll leave their waste everywhere!

04:16.160 --> 04:18.480
&lrm;Who's going to feed my poor pigeons?

04:18.600 --> 04:22.040
&lrm;Mr. Ramier, you're banned
&lrm;from every park in Paris.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.400
&lrm;Leave or I'll call the authorities.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.360
&lrm;Wait, I'm the authorities.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.720
&lrm;Get out!

04:32.520 --> 04:35.200
&lrm;I almost feel sorry for that man.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.480
&lrm;[Tikki] What a unique character.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.280
&lrm;He was like a human bird.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.640
&lrm;All he needed was a feather jacket
&lrm;to complete the look.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.440
&lrm;A feather jacket?

04:45.280 --> 04:46.680
&lrm;Nice thinking, Tikki.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.000
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] <i>&lrm;Poor Mr. Ramier.</i>

04:54.680 --> 04:56.560
&lrm;The feeling of injustice.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.800
&lrm;Such easy prey for my Akuma.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.000
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,

05:10.160 --> 05:11.920
&lrm;and evilize him.

05:23.040 --> 05:26.320
&lrm;Mr. Pigeon, I'm Hawk Moth.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.560
&lrm;Neither this police officer
&lrm;nor any other park keeper

05:30.680 --> 05:33.880
&lrm;should stop you from taking care
&lrm;of your friends.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.600
&lrm;What would Paris be without pigeons?

05:36.720 --> 05:39.040
&lrm;What would pigeons be without you?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.280
&lrm;[evil laugh]

05:43.040 --> 05:44.240

05:44.560 --> 05:46.120
&lrm;[mad cooing]

05:59.720 --> 06:00.600
&lrm;Yes!

06:06.760 --> 06:09.520
&lrm;-That's a derby.
&lrm;-Thanks, Tikki.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.880
&lrm;We're so awesome!

06:14.480 --> 06:15.440
&lrm;We?

06:16.120 --> 06:18.680
&lrm;Sorry, you're so awesome.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.360
&lrm;When are we... you going to make the hat?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.840
&lrm;And ruin these nails? Of course not.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.880
&lrm;Daddy will pay someone.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.520
&lrm;Ouch!

06:57.040 --> 06:58.640
&lrm;-What are you looking for?
&lrm;-A feather.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.760
&lrm;I don't have a feather for the hat.
&lrm;It has to have one.

07:11.040 --> 07:11.880
&lrm;Yes!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.280
&lrm;Sorry, Mr. Officer, Sir.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.200
&lrm;Come on, can't we go any faster?

07:45.720 --> 07:48.160
&lrm;[Driver] Sorry, we have a situation.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.360
&lrm;You need to get off.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.160
&lrm;This is weird.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.920
&lrm;[car horns]

<i>&lrm;Sorry to ruffle your feathers,</i>

08:21.600 --> 08:23.280
<i>&lrm;but Paris now belongs to pigeons.</i>

&lrm;[he coos]

08:30.800 --> 08:32.520
&lrm;[Marinette] Paris needs us.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.440
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

08:37.120 --> 08:38.000
&lrm;Yeah!

09:01.560 --> 09:03.680
&lrm;[loud cooing]

09:04.000 --> 09:06.120
&lrm;This is weirder than weird.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.600
&lrm;Birds of a feather flock together.

09:08.760 --> 09:09.840
&lrm;[he sneezes]

09:12.120 --> 09:14.240
&lrm;I'm allergic to feathers.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.520
&lrm;-That's helpful.
&lrm;-Tell me about it.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.320
&lrm;[he begins to sneeze]

09:19.000 --> 09:22.600
&lrm;There's another problem.
&lrm;The park keepers are vanishing.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.280
&lrm;What? We have to track down Mr. Pigeon.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.440
&lrm;But how?

09:27.280 --> 09:30.760
&lrm;I don't know where we can find him
&lrm;but he can find us.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.680

09:38.120 --> 09:39.680
&lrm;[humming]

09:42.880 --> 09:45.480
&lrm;Act natural or he'll never show up.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.240
&lrm;What? I am acting natural.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.640
&lrm;[cooing]

09:57.760 --> 10:01.760
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir.
&lrm;Job well done, buddy-boy.

10:01.880 --> 10:05.240
&lrm;Pigeons will reign supreme.
&lrm;Power to the pigeons!

10:05.760 --> 10:07.880
&lrm;[triumphant cooing]

10:13.440 --> 10:15.880
&lrm;Where is he?
&lrm;He should have been here by now.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.160

10:57.280 --> 10:59.240
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Where's that bird brain Mr. Pigeon?

10:59.360 --> 11:00.720
&lrm;He's gotta be here.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.160
&lrm;If you want to give Paris
&lrm;to the pigeons for good,

11:07.320 --> 11:10.360
&lrm;you must rid the city of those two pests.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.800
&lrm;[cooing]

11:13.400 --> 11:16.000
&lrm;I feel like birdseed all of a sudden.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.040
&lrm;[they both gasp]

11:19.160 --> 11:20.560
&lrm;Any bright ideas?

11:20.720 --> 11:23.320
&lrm;You're the cat,
&lrm;don't you eat these things?

11:28.400 --> 11:29.240
&lrm;Look.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.000
&lrm;[Mr. Pigeon coos]

11:33.400 --> 11:36.160
&lrm;Chirpy day! I'm so ruthless.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.680
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Excellent.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.800
&lrm;Take their Miraculouses.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.800
&lrm;Your Miraculouses. Give them to me

11:42.960 --> 11:45.360
&lrm;or face the wrath of my feathered friends.

&lrm;[cooing]

11:49.160 --> 11:50.120
&lrm;[banging]

11:52.880 --> 11:56.040
&lrm;On the count of three,
&lrm;my pigeons will open fire.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.120
&lrm;You can save your sorry skins

11:59.240 --> 12:02.800
&lrm;by handing me your Miraculous. One, two...

12:03.200 --> 12:04.520
&lrm;Cat Noir, the bars.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.040
&lrm;Cataclysm!

12:17.520 --> 12:20.560
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Well, well, the pigeon is a chicken.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.080
&lrm;Me? I'm not flying away.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.720
&lrm;I'm just killing two birds with one stone.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.000

12:27.160 --> 12:28.280

12:39.120 --> 12:42.160
&lrm;Merry Christmas!

12:49.280 --> 12:51.440
&lrm;I'm not done with you yet.

12:57.720 --> 12:58.760
&lrm;[beeping]

12:59.120 --> 13:02.200
&lrm;I've got to go
&lrm;before my identity is revealed.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.120
&lrm;You wouldn't want
&lrm;to let the cat out the bag.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.880
&lrm;Ha, ha, very funny.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.000
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir,

13:11.120 --> 13:14.560
&lrm;I'm in great danger of losing money
&lrm;if my guests leave Paris.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.600
&lrm;Get rid of those pigeons.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.160
&lrm;Before we do, I have an urgent need.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.960
&lrm;An urgent need? I see.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.640
&lrm;Head to the Royal Suite.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.760
&lrm;There's paper in there.
&lrm;Perhaps you'd prefer a litter tray?

13:28.520 --> 13:31.480
&lrm;No need for litter.
&lrm;But could I have some camembert?

13:36.600 --> 13:38.160
&lrm;Sorry, emergency.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.360
&lrm;[knocking]

13:39.520 --> 13:41.600
&lrm;-How do you like your camembert?
&lrm;-Runny.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.800
&lrm;[knocking]

13:42.960 --> 13:45.640
&lrm;-Unpasteurized Saint-Claquos.
&lrm;-Thanks.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.720
&lrm;[beeping]

13:50.240 --> 13:52.560
&lrm;[Plagg screams]

13:53.880 --> 13:56.440
&lrm;The exhaustion. My poor aching body.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.960
&lrm;I can't move a muscle.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.480
&lrm;[Adrien] You wanna bet?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.200
&lrm;[gasping]

14:02.040 --> 14:03.840
&lrm;My gooeyness...

14:05.360 --> 14:06.960
&lrm;Eat up, Ladybug needs help.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.280
&lrm;I can get a much better view from up here.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.120
&lrm;They're flying in the same direction.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.040
&lrm;Better follow them.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.640
&lrm;[Elevator beeps]

14:23.760 --> 14:26.480
&lrm;-Ready when you are.
&lrm;-Let's go.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.920
&lrm;That's where Mr. Pigeon keeps
&lrm;the park keepers.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.120
&lrm;The Grand Palais.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.680
&lrm;[he begins to sneeze]

14:49.120 --> 14:50.360
&lrm;My pigeon radar is on alert.

14:50.480 --> 14:54.360
&lrm;Either your radar's on the brink
&lrm;or the park keepers are unattended.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.680
&lrm;Let's set the cat among the pigeons.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.360
&lrm;Hold up, kitty. It's too easy.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.000
&lrm;I've got a plan.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.280
&lrm;[Mr. Pigeon] Perfect timing.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.160
&lrm;We're ready to greet them.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.880
&lrm;They're going to fall right into my trap.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.480
&lrm;It won't be long
&lrm;before you get your Miraculouses.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.360
&lrm;I can't wait, my dear Pigeon.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.440
&lrm;[Ladybug] If we destroy that bird call,
&lrm;we'll capture the Akuma.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.400
&lrm;You open the window,
&lrm;I grab him and you snag the bird call.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.160
&lrm;Early bird gets the worm.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.200
&lrm;[he sneezes loudly]

15:36.240 --> 15:37.760
&lrm;[tinkling]

15:39.000 --> 15:41.320
&lrm;So much for the element of surprise.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.120
&lrm;[yelling]

15:43.800 --> 15:44.840
&lrm;[cooing]

15:49.120 --> 15:51.320
&lrm;[yelling and cooing]

15:51.720 --> 15:53.960
&lrm;Diddle-dee-dee, come closer.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.520
&lrm;I have a bone to "peck" with you.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.920
&lrm;I'd be honored.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.920
&lrm;[yelling]

16:05.840 --> 16:07.240
&lrm;[Agent] Get us out of here.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.840
&lrm;[evil giggle]

16:09.520 --> 16:10.960
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:16.160 --> 16:19.040
&lrm;A coin? What am I supposed
&lrm;to do with that?

16:23.160 --> 16:24.320
&lrm;[tinkling]

16:27.040 --> 16:29.640
&lrm;You can't buy yourself out of here.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.800
&lrm;Cat Noir!

16:56.800 --> 16:58.240
&lrm;[Ladybug] Snack time, pigeons.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.079
&lrm;[yelling]

17:08.040 --> 17:09.960
&lrm;My bird call. No!

17:11.520 --> 17:12.680
&lrm;Cat Noir, grab it.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.480
&lrm;[he sneezes]

17:34.400 --> 17:35.440
&lrm;[crashing]

17:36.080 --> 17:37.360
&lrm;-Yes.
&lrm;-Ouch.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.920
&lrm;[desperate cooing]

17:41.200 --> 17:43.320
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.920
&lrm;Time to de-evilize.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.280
&lrm;Gotcha!

17:54.480 --> 17:56.560
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.880
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.240
&lrm;[twinkling]

18:00.360 --> 18:01.920
&lrm;[whooshing]

18:06.440 --> 18:08.480
&lrm;What happened? Where am I?

18:08.760 --> 18:09.920
&lrm;Pound it.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.920
&lrm;Wretched pigeons, wretched Ladybug!

18:13.040 --> 18:15.720
&lrm;I'll destroy every one of you.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.400
&lrm;[he roars]

18:22.840 --> 18:25.080
&lrm;I have less than an hour.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.880
&lrm;[busy signal rings]

18:40.240 --> 18:41.640
&lrm;Where is that girl?

18:42.720 --> 18:46.320
&lrm;Hello, Mr. Damocles,
&lrm;I am Mr. Agreste's assistant.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.680
&lrm;Hello Miss.
&lrm;Pardon me, but where is Mr. Agreste?

18:50.800 --> 18:51.680
<i>&lrm;I'm here.</i>

18:52.280 --> 18:53.120
&lrm;Ah...

18:53.240 --> 18:55.880
&lrm;Hello Mr. Agreste, welcome to our school.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.520
<i>&lrm;Adrien, take Nathalie around.</i>

18:58.640 --> 19:02.000
&lrm;There's Mr. Agreste. He's coming this way.

19:03.960 --> 19:08.560
&lrm;They have poured their hearts
&lrm;and souls into their projects.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.600
&lrm;Where have you been? You got your hat?

19:11.760 --> 19:13.360
&lrm;Yep, here.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.240
&lrm;[she gasps]

19:15.520 --> 19:18.280
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-But it's the same as Chloe's.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.360
&lrm;What?

19:20.720 --> 19:23.280
&lrm;Hi, Mr. Agreste, I'm Chloe Bourgeois.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.280
&lrm;You know my father, the Mayor.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.960
&lrm;That thieving little brat!

19:28.240 --> 19:31.640
&lrm;-Shall I take care of it?
&lrm;-I think I can handle this.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.400
<i>&lrm;Turn the tablet to Miss Bourgeois's hat.</i>

19:39.440 --> 19:40.640
<i>&lrm;Is this a joke?</i>

19:41.040 --> 19:41.960
&lrm;No fair!

19:42.280 --> 19:46.080
&lrm;Marinette copied my design.
&lrm;It's scandalous!

19:46.200 --> 19:47.040
&lrm;[sobbing]

19:49.160 --> 19:51.200
&lrm;I apologize for the situation.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.920
&lrm;But I can prove
&lrm;that this derby hat is mine.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.280
<i>&lrm;Go ahead.</i>

19:57.920 --> 20:00.400
&lrm;Everything is handmade

20:00.520 --> 20:03.520
&lrm;from the embroidery
&lrm;to the weaving and the stitching.

20:03.920 --> 20:04.840
&lrm;Done by myself.

20:05.360 --> 20:09.520
&lrm;And there's an element
&lrm;that only a true designer knows about.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.200
&lrm;I signed mine.

20:16.040 --> 20:16.960
&lrm;[Chloe cries]

20:18.240 --> 20:19.560
<i>&lrm;Exquisite creation.</i>

20:19.720 --> 20:23.720
<i>&lrm;You have the laboring hands</i>
<i>&lrm;of a hat maker, Miss...</i>

20:24.200 --> 20:25.120
&lrm;Marinette.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.320
<i>&lrm;Congratulations, Miss Marinette.</i>
<i>&lrm;You're the winner.</i>

20:29.560 --> 20:31.800
&lrm;Thank you, thank you, thank you.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.480
<i>&lrm;Adrien will wear your derby.</i>

20:37.960 --> 20:39.360
&lrm;Awesome job, Marinette.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.360
&lrm;[he starts to sneeze]

20:43.480 --> 20:45.520
&lrm;[he sneezes loudly]

20:46.280 --> 20:47.280
&lrm;[sniffing]

20:49.720 --> 20:51.720
&lrm;I'm allergic to feathers.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.200
&lrm;[he sneezes]

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
<i>&lrm;Gesundheit.</i>

20:56.560 --> 20:57.640
&lrm;[he sneezes]

20:58.480 --> 20:59.360
&lrm;Thanks.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.040
&lrm;[cheering]

21:02.200 --> 21:03.680
&lrm;[giggling]
