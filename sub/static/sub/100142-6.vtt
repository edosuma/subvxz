00:07.804 --> 00:09.595

00:11.553 --> 00:12.804
Shit'll fuck you up.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.553
Is Derek here?

00:14.553 --> 00:15.804
- Derek is dead.
- [Carl] The death benefit.

00:15.804 --> 00:17.428
When someone dies
in the military,

00:17.428 --> 00:19.178

like, 100,000 bucks.

00:19.178 --> 00:21.178
I'm willing to give you
1/3 of the benefit.

this weekend for a cookout.

00:30.053 --> 00:31.553
A ton of black doctors
will be there.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.220
Come.
It'll be good for business.

00:33.220 --> 00:34.887

during my lunch break?

00:34.887 --> 00:36.470

00:39.637 --> 00:40.679

00:40.679 --> 00:42.720
The deal is, you're fucked.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.053
I'm Sarah.

00:44.053 --> 00:45.679

- AA.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.303

00:55.428 --> 00:57.136
says we could each
get 10 grand.

00:57.136 --> 00:58.595
You sure you
weren't molested?

00:58.595 --> 01:00.136
I'd remember
if he touched me.

01:00.136 --> 01:02.637
I didn't sign on
to raise your children, Frank.

01:02.637 --> 01:05.470
Well, the joke's on you.
They're my son Carl's.

01:05.470 --> 01:06.929
[Frank] I'll give you

01:06.929 --> 01:08.428
40 and 5.

01:08.428 --> 01:10.428
[Anne] Got my third job
with my family business.

01:10.428 --> 01:12.053
[Carl] You know when I said
you could stay here?

01:12.053 --> 01:13.762
I didn't mean
your entire family.

01:13.762 --> 01:16.261
[Anne] We thought you meant
the plural you, "ustedes."

01:16.261 --> 01:17.720

workers from Texas.

02:40.303 --> 02:43.512
Many observers view this
as a purely political move

02:43.512 --> 02:47.178
designed to punish liberal
sanctuary cities like Chicago.

02:47.178 --> 02:49.178
When reached for comment,
Texas governor--

02:49.178 --> 02:52.428

03:06.387 --> 03:09.053
I can't wait to see her.

03:09.053 --> 03:11.053
Derek loved her so much.

03:11.053 --> 03:12.553
Cut the bullshit, Pepa.

03:12.553 --> 03:14.387
Derek didn't
give two shits about Franny,

03:14.387 --> 03:16.387
- and neither do you.
- What?

03:16.387 --> 03:18.679
I can't wait
to see how she's grown up.

03:18.679 --> 03:21.345
I mean, with a genius like you
for a mother,

03:21.345 --> 03:24.804
I'm sure she'll be able to read
by the time she's 15.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.637
I know what you're doing.

03:26.637 --> 03:28.178
What am I doing?

03:28.178 --> 03:30.178
You think I'd rather
lose my fair share

03:30.178 --> 03:33.053
of Derek's death benefit
than let you have Franny.

03:33.053 --> 03:34.887
Joke's on you, bitch.

03:34.887 --> 03:38.970
Franny will be there tomorrow
on time as scheduled.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.053
And, as per our agreement,

03:41.053 --> 03:43.261
I want my check
posthaste.

03:43.261 --> 03:45.845
And I'll want Franny
to call me "Mom."

04:06.303 --> 04:07.970
Hey.

04:07.970 --> 04:09.762
Where you think
you're going?

04:09.762 --> 04:11.762
Just taking the infirmary

04:11.762 --> 04:13.762

04:13.762 --> 04:15.428

Not today.

04:15.428 --> 04:17.804
Budget crunch.
Biowaste truck service

04:17.804 --> 04:19.762
and a whole bunch
of other shit cancelled

04:19.762 --> 04:21.637

04:21.637 --> 04:22.887
So what you want me to do with
all this medical waste then?

04:22.887 --> 04:25.261
This shit deadly, boss.

04:25.261 --> 04:27.053

this thing got AIDS.

04:27.053 --> 04:28.345

in the incinerator.

in there anymore, Frank,

04:55.929 --> 04:57.470

04:57.470 --> 05:01.470
You kids got any
formal wear with soul?

05:01.470 --> 05:04.387
All of this stuff looks like
the garb of a colonizer,

05:04.387 --> 05:07.011
and I got a follow-up
with the Okafurs.

05:10.178 --> 05:11.345

05:12.679 --> 05:14.220
A little cultural awareness

05:14.220 --> 05:17.720

can't hurt.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.261

Yeah, but having Kelly around

just made me realize
how much I like you.

07:21.553 --> 07:23.345
We're keeping it strictly

get out of your house.

so you could get in my pants.

redheaded toddlers by now.

10:23.887 --> 10:25.804
I'm serious, Ian.

10:25.804 --> 10:27.345
I negotiated Pepa
down to partial custody

10:27.345 --> 10:29.762
in exchange for
some of Derek's death benefit,

10:29.762 --> 10:31.637
but I can't stomach
the thought of that bitch

10:31.637 --> 10:34.053
having one second
alone with Franny.

10:34.053 --> 10:36.136
So you wanna pass
off a fake Franny?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.804
Preferably one
horrible enough

10:37.804 --> 10:40.470
that she'll drop the
custody fight altogether.

10:40.470 --> 10:41.887
But apparently
I've raised a great kid.

10:41.887 --> 10:43.679
She'll totally wanna
keep her.

10:43.679 --> 10:45.011
[Ian] Yeah,
never gonna happen.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.470
Pepa'll know
it's not her.

10:46.470 --> 10:48.512
People are super
racist against redheads.

10:48.512 --> 10:50.053
They think we all look alike.

10:50.053 --> 10:52.261
Frank calls me "Ian,"
like, twice a week.

10:52.261 --> 10:53.679
Okay.
Uh, well,

10:53.679 --> 10:55.804
you can try
the Girls & Boys Club

10:55.804 --> 10:57.178
or a group home.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.512
Those kids
are pretty screwed up.

10:58.512 --> 11:00.512
Anyway,
I gotta get to work.

11:00.512 --> 11:02.804
Since when
do you have a job?

11:02.804 --> 11:04.970
Well, it's less of a job
than a Medicare scam

11:04.970 --> 11:07.845
I'm being forced into
by my corrupt parole officer.

11:07.845 --> 11:10.178
Gay Jesus to insurance fraud?

11:10.178 --> 11:13.720
Yeah.
Prison really reformed me.

11:13.720 --> 11:14.679
See you guys.

11:24.303 --> 11:26.470
Inmate Milkovich.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.553
Gotta hand it to you.

11:29.553 --> 11:31.887
One hell of an escape plan.

11:31.887 --> 11:34.512
Hey, imagine if you could
actually manage a budget, huh?

11:34.512 --> 11:36.845
I'd be home right now
knocking back a cold one.

11:36.845 --> 11:40.720
The sheer fortitude to climb
into medical biowaste.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.220
You know, we've had
cases of the plague in here,

11:43.220 --> 11:45.220
actual medieval Black Death,

11:45.220 --> 11:47.720
and nine strains
of flesh-eating bacteria

11:47.720 --> 11:49.720
in the C block showers too.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.053
What can I say?
Desperate times.

11:52.053 --> 11:55.553
What kind of dumbass would go
to those lengths to escape

11:55.553 --> 11:57.970
when they're already free?

11:59.553 --> 12:02.220
Yeah, that's right,
free.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.470
Your cooperation
with the prosecution

12:04.470 --> 12:05.553
in the El Chapo case,

12:05.553 --> 12:07.345
that got your name jumped

12:07.345 --> 12:10.804
right to the top
of the release list.

12:10.804 --> 12:12.553
Guess that, uh,

12:12.553 --> 12:15.095
makes us all done here, huh?

12:15.095 --> 12:16.470
Heard through the grapevine

12:16.470 --> 12:18.887
that the Calderón cartel's

12:18.887 --> 12:22.387
excited to welcome you
back to the world.

12:29.762 --> 12:31.929
As you see,
we are well prepared

12:31.929 --> 12:35.595
to welcome a baby
into our home.

12:35.595 --> 12:37.387
This is your home?

12:37.387 --> 12:39.428
Gotta say,
I was expecting something

12:39.428 --> 12:41.345
a little more rustic.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.804
We live in Minneapolis,
Mr. Gallagher.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.595
God has provided us
with everything

12:46.595 --> 12:48.762
except for the blessing
of a child.

12:48.762 --> 12:51.011
When can we see
the baby again?

12:51.011 --> 12:52.804
Well,
there's still the issue

12:52.804 --> 12:55.136
of the outstanding
application fee.

12:55.136 --> 12:56.637
$500.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.387
Thank you.

13:04.637 --> 13:08.220
Well, I'm very excited to
continue the adoption process.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.804
Unfortunately, it might take
a little bit longer.

13:14.804 --> 13:16.804
There are
other applicants,

13:16.804 --> 13:19.387
so due diligence on my part
is a must.

13:19.387 --> 13:21.929
In order
to expedite things,

13:21.929 --> 13:24.220
it'd be very helpful
to have a room on site.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.845
We can get you a room.

13:25.845 --> 13:27.470
[Frank]
A suite would be best.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.970
And let's leave the tab open,

13:28.970 --> 13:31.553
in case the baby
wants some room service.

13:31.553 --> 13:34.595
The appetite on this kid,
I gotta tell ya.

13:36.970 --> 13:38.720
There's no way we're getting
run off our own block

13:38.720 --> 13:41.011
by Chicano Woody
from Toy Story.

13:41.011 --> 13:43.220
You shoulda let me
kick their asses.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.011
Look, the enemy
may have won the battle,

13:46.011 --> 13:49.345
but tactical precision will
guarantee us ultimate victory.

13:49.345 --> 13:50.512
[speaking Spanish]

13:50.512 --> 13:51.512
What are you talking about?

13:51.512 --> 13:52.929
I'm talking about war, people,

13:52.929 --> 13:54.595
and war is hell.

13:54.595 --> 13:56.595
But lucky for all of you,
I almost passed

13:56.595 --> 13:58.637
my battle strategy
class at military school.

13:58.637 --> 14:01.720
Let's see.
I suggest a counterattack.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.762
What, there were, like,
three or four of those guys?

14:03.762 --> 14:05.512
Last I checked,
there were a million of you.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.053
Let's use that to our advantage
and strike back.

14:08.053 --> 14:10.011
We are cooks, not fighters.

14:10.011 --> 14:12.345
[Carl] Trust me,
overwhelming force.

14:12.345 --> 14:13.470
Ever heard of
shock and awe?

14:13.470 --> 14:15.970
Operation Iraqi Freedom?

14:15.970 --> 14:18.178
Worked out pretty great
for America, don't you think?

14:18.178 --> 14:21.220
Won the war and got to kick it
in Iraq for 20 years.

14:23.845 --> 14:26.720
Look, you don't wanna get
run off your own block.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.261
Well, this is
how you get it back.

14:28.261 --> 14:29.720
All right,
I want everybody

14:29.720 --> 14:31.303
to go grab something sharp
or heavy.

14:31.303 --> 14:32.887
Let's roll!

14:36.428 --> 14:38.387
- [Val] Mr. Ball?
- Yeah.

14:38.387 --> 14:40.762
Have a seat.
She'll be with you shortly.

14:40.762 --> 14:42.095
Um...

14:42.095 --> 14:43.637
Will there be a physical?

14:43.637 --> 14:46.095
This is a lawyer's office.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.428
No, right,
of course.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.470
I just meant for the case,

14:48.470 --> 14:49.929
if she needs to see my...

14:53.595 --> 14:55.720
I'll show myself
to a seat.

15:01.053 --> 15:03.679
Kevin Ball,
backup center, '94.

15:03.679 --> 15:06.095
Coach tickled my dick.

15:08.553 --> 15:11.512
[metal clattering]

15:14.261 --> 15:15.929
Súbito.

15:15.929 --> 15:17.929
[Lip] Hey.

15:17.929 --> 15:19.762
Hey, how'd it go?

15:19.762 --> 15:20.929
Fine.

15:20.929 --> 15:22.345
That's it, "fine"?
Hi.

15:22.345 --> 15:24.011
[Fred cries]

15:24.011 --> 15:25.553
That accurately describes
how it went: fine.

15:25.553 --> 15:27.720
[Lip] Ugh.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.136
What's up?
Is something wrong?

15:30.136 --> 15:32.303
[Tami] Uh, what, you mean
besides the fact that

15:32.303 --> 15:34.095
you dragged me to the park
to show off

15:34.095 --> 15:35.470
all the groupies
you've been hooking up with?

15:35.470 --> 15:37.970
I'm--I'm not
hooking up with anyone.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.345
Really?
What about Sarah?

15:40.345 --> 15:41.387
- No.
- [laughs]

15:41.387 --> 15:42.553
Come on, Lip.

15:42.553 --> 15:44.804
I saw the arm squeeze.

15:44.804 --> 15:45.720
- Arm squeeze?
- Yeah.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.512
[overlapping chatter]

15:47.512 --> 15:50.136
The arm squeeze,

15:50.136 --> 15:51.804
a move reserved
for someone you've fucked

15:51.804 --> 15:53.178
or someone you want to fuck.

15:53.178 --> 15:54.470
Right, well,

15:54.470 --> 15:56.136
Sarah and I
are just friends.

15:56.136 --> 15:57.470
Yeah.
What's her deal?

15:57.470 --> 15:59.762
What, she's got a boyfriend,
married, single?

15:59.762 --> 16:01.970
Um, she's divorced,
I think.

16:01.970 --> 16:03.136
Divorced?

16:03.136 --> 16:05.095
- Yeah.
- [laughs] Yeah.

16:05.095 --> 16:08.804
Oh, yeah, no, she doesn't
want you at all.

16:08.804 --> 16:10.136
She gets it.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.762
Yeah?

16:11.762 --> 16:12.595
She doesn't even understand
what I'm saying,

16:12.595 --> 16:14.178
but she gets it.

16:14.178 --> 16:15.679
Because women know.

16:15.679 --> 16:17.053
- [Fred crying]
- Like, we all know.

16:17.053 --> 16:18.679
Right.

16:18.679 --> 16:22.512
Look, Lip, you don't
have to lie to protect me.

16:22.512 --> 16:25.637
Okay, you don't have
to protect me at all.

16:25.637 --> 16:28.470
You know, we can co-parent
and still do our own thing.

16:28.470 --> 16:31.011
- Sure, sure.
- I'm not the jealous type.

16:31.011 --> 16:32.512
But you know
what will piss me off

16:32.512 --> 16:34.804
is being lied to like I'm dumb,
because I'm not.

16:34.804 --> 16:36.553
- No, no.
It's just, um...

16:36.553 --> 16:37.804
When he's upset like this,

16:37.804 --> 16:39.011
he doesn't really
wanna be bounced.

16:39.011 --> 16:40.345
It's more like you--
you want to

16:40.345 --> 16:41.804
put his head
on your shoulder

16:41.804 --> 16:43.595
and then you kind of
want to rock him--

16:43.595 --> 16:44.804
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.178
- Parenting tips?
- Well...

16:46.178 --> 16:47.970
- Really? Okay.
- Hey, buddy.

16:47.970 --> 16:49.929
- Why don't you go to Daddy?
- Hey.

16:49.929 --> 16:51.887
Yeah, 'cause Daddy knows
how to do everything.

16:51.887 --> 16:55.220
Hey, hey, hey.
Tami.

17:02.887 --> 17:04.303
Hi, there.

17:04.303 --> 17:06.595
I'm at the website
for your group home,

17:06.595 --> 17:09.136
and I see diversity statistics

17:09.136 --> 17:11.553
for several different
minority groups,

17:11.553 --> 17:14.053
but there's no category
for redheads.

17:14.053 --> 17:16.762
Seems like an oversight.

17:16.762 --> 17:19.387
Actually,
redheads are a minority,

17:19.387 --> 17:20.929
and it's statements
like yours

17:20.929 --> 17:23.637
that are a reason that hair-ism
is a na--

Sorry.
I'm Larry, Larry Seaver,

18:45.595 --> 18:48.387
and I have the honor
of being your parole officer.

18:48.387 --> 18:49.720
You're my parole--

18:49.720 --> 18:51.095
The fuck
you chasing my bus for?

18:51.095 --> 18:52.804
Oh, I wasn't chasing you.

18:52.804 --> 18:55.220
I was gonna meet you at the
next stop, offer you a ride.

18:55.220 --> 18:56.595
A ride?

We're in this thing together,
okay?

19:13.512 --> 19:16.303
Excuse me.
Can I answer any questions?

19:16.303 --> 19:19.845
Oh, no, I'm just
window-shopping, thanks.

19:19.845 --> 19:23.345
Actually, can I ask about
your return policy?

19:24.845 --> 19:29.303
If a foster parent
wants to end an arrangement,

19:29.303 --> 19:31.512
we will accept the child back
with open arms.

19:31.512 --> 19:33.220
Excellent.

19:33.220 --> 19:35.303
Can I ask about, uh,
this little one?

19:35.303 --> 19:38.220
That's Bella.
Over there.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.679
Nice.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.261
She have any major
behavioral issues

19:41.261 --> 19:43.762
or anything keeping her
from being adopted?

19:43.762 --> 19:46.136
No, actually,
she's very sweet.

19:46.136 --> 19:49.679
But her sister Stella
on the other hand...

19:49.679 --> 19:52.970
We have a policy
of not splitting up siblings,

19:52.970 --> 19:54.637
so if you're
interested in Bella,

19:54.637 --> 19:56.887
you have to take Stella too.

19:56.887 --> 19:58.637
Come.

20:01.095 --> 20:02.679
Hi!

20:04.387 --> 20:05.762
Hi, Bella.

20:05.762 --> 20:07.970
How would you like
to come and play

20:07.970 --> 20:10.720
with my daughter, Franny,
and I tomorrow?

20:10.720 --> 20:12.345
We're really nice.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.929
You a pervert or just
a garden-variety retard?

20:14.929 --> 20:17.178
Girls usually
aren't pedos,

20:17.178 --> 20:19.804
but I've seen weirder things
in foster care.

20:19.804 --> 20:22.261
Excuse me, little girl.

20:22.261 --> 20:24.845
I'm neither a pedo
nor dumb.

20:24.845 --> 20:27.011
[Stella] You sure about
the dumb part?

20:27.011 --> 20:30.220
See, you can't honestly
think you'll be able

52:34.387 --> 52:36.095
- You're such an idiot.
- What?

52:36.095 --> 52:37.762
I mean, were you even
listening to me?

52:37.762 --> 52:39.553
Yes, I was listening,

52:39.553 --> 52:41.345
hence the RV.

52:44.512 --> 52:48.303

52:48.303 --> 52:51.095
Well...

52:51.095 --> 52:52.387
[scoffs]

52:52.387 --> 52:56.261
I guess
we're living in an RV now.

52:57.303 --> 52:59.011
Yeah?

52:59.011 --> 53:00.345
Yeah.

53:00.345 --> 53:03.345
Oh, hey, Debs,
can you give us a minute?

53:03.345 --> 53:04.387
Thanks.

53:08.887 --> 53:11.553
Look, so we're gonna
both be living in here.

53:11.553 --> 53:14.345
We should probably come up with
some kind of system, right,

53:14.345 --> 53:16.220
you know, in case you're
hooking up with guys,

53:16.220 --> 53:19.303
maybe a sock on the door or--

53:19.303 --> 53:21.637
[laughs]

53:21.637 --> 53:25.970
There's not gonna be
any socks on the door, okay?

53:25.970 --> 53:28.637
I totally struck out
at the bar.

53:30.970 --> 53:33.428
The only reason I went out
in the first place

53:33.428 --> 53:35.887
was to make you jealous,

53:35.887 --> 53:40.887
and the only reason I wanted
to make you jealous is because,

53:40.887 --> 53:43.679
you know,

53:43.679 --> 53:45.387
obviously...

53:45.387 --> 53:49.887
Obviously?

53:49.887 --> 53:51.428
I still like you.

53:51.428 --> 53:53.553
I--

53:53.553 --> 53:56.053
I really like you.

54:01.136 --> 54:04.679
So what are we?

54:04.679 --> 54:08.762
I just agreed to move
into a shitty RV with you,

54:08.762 --> 54:11.845
so I think we're together.

54:11.845 --> 54:14.011
Yeah?

Yeah.
