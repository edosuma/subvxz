02:11.799 --> 02:14.717
The time has come
to go to war again.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.679
Not with Iraq, international terrorists,
or what was once Yugoslavia,

02:18.764 --> 02:20.640
but with the medfly,

02:20.724 --> 02:23.559
a potentially devastating insect

02:23.644 --> 02:27.146
that has chosen to make California
its new home.

02:27.231 --> 02:32.401
Despite assurances that spraying poses
no significant health risks to the public,

02:32.486 --> 02:35.154
the public is not convinced.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.199
People sense they're being
kept in the dark purposely.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.202
Furthermore, there is no consensus

02:41.286 --> 02:43.913
as to whether the objectives
are even realistic.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.416
Is this a war that can be won?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.418
Some say no.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.422
Are we just going through the motions
so certain people can cover themselves?

02:53.507 --> 02:56.092
- Honey, it's on!
- Some say yes.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.178
- Okay, I'm coming.
- How is this war fought?

02:59.263 --> 03:02.515
It's like fishing. We use bait.

03:02.599 --> 03:07.228
Actually, the bait is spread over our city
at night, like a glaze.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.230
This is very discriminate bait,

03:09.314 --> 03:11.732
- Do you have to wear your glasses on TV?
- Like smart bombs

03:11.817 --> 03:14.485
- Shh.
- That destroy one thing, but nothing else.

03:14.570 --> 03:18.197
The bait attracts the hungry,
newly hatched medflies

03:18.282 --> 03:20.283
and poisons only them.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.661
The war's objective is clear –

03:23.745 --> 03:28.249
destroy the medfly
before it has a chance to destroy us.

Marian, what's so interesting?

04:07.372 --> 04:09.332
Isn't that Alex Trebek?

04:09.416 --> 04:13.252
- Alex Trebek? Where?
- Next to the woman with the white hair.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.588
Is that Alex Trebek?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.589
Yes, I'm sure it is.

Marian.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.429
Please.

05:01.385 --> 05:05.429
Taken their time adopting
a policy of coexistence with the medfly

05:05.514 --> 05:08.766
'cause that's the only
realistic course open to us.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.403
The dog stays outside.
I've told you a hundred times!

08:49.487 --> 08:52.406
Don't put Suzy outside.
The spraying – It's gonna give him cancer!

08:52.490 --> 08:54.969
It's not gonna give it cancer!
Don't you get environmental on me, Sherri.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.411
Have you listened to the news lately?
It's dangerous!

08:57.495 --> 08:59.788
They wouldn't be doing it
if it was dangerous!

08:59.873 --> 09:02.917
Come on, kids!
It's all right! Come on outside!

09:04.461 --> 09:07.379

make it Sunday, I'll bring fresh trout.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.985
Marian, why did you do that?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.445
- What?
- Invite them to our house for supper?

10:13.530 --> 10:14.947
I didn't. You did.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.949
- No, I didn't.
- You said, "Let's set a date."

10:17.033 --> 10:19.512
I had to say "Let's set a date"
because you invited 'em to our house.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.120
That was just a comment, Ralph.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.706

10:23.790 --> 10:26.709
He's some kind of a doctor.
I think he's a dentist.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.711
Her name is Marian.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.130
- Marian, we don't even know them.
- Just relax.

10:31.214 --> 10:35.217
Okay? Just... relax.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.470

get on you today?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.514
Ow! I got one.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.517

to describe myself for you?

I'm a blonde.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.522
36-24-34.

You don't do that.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.197

10:57.282 --> 11:00.492
Oh, yeah?

Don't you want me
to lick your balls first?

11:36.446 --> 11:40.199
Mmm. Mmm. You taste so good.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.786
Ooh, your cock
is getting so big in my mouth.

So big.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.468

- And she's an artist, I think.
- Oh, yeah? What kind?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.643
What kind? She's a painter.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.438
You know. She paints pictures.

- I don't know.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.822
- What, is it broken?
- Yeah.

I don't want him to see me here.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.995
Is he?

16:37.080 --> 16:39.498
He won't, baby.
He's still asleep.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.584
'Cause kids shouldn't see
that kind of thing.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.836
Jesus, how am I gonna explain this?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.297
Jesus. Okay.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.883
Kids. Crack.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.511
Kids – Kids on crack. Okay.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.721
- What?
- Fucking dog.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.849
Fucking dog knows. I know.
That fucking dog.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.852
- Hey. Ruff! Ruff!
- Just can't live with all this.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.854
I need to –

17:02.939 --> 17:05.440
What do you gotta smoke
in the morning for?

No, I told you
I don't wanna do that anymore.

Hello.

Shut up.

These you can mist.
Water them once a week.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.622
Harriet, we're running
behind schedule.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.792
- I'm gonna bring the bags down to the car.
- Okay. All right.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.878
- So those you can mist. Right.
- So these are the same –

Jerry? Saturday's
Casey's birthday party.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.510
The plan was to swim.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.388
Howard's nephew's a lifeguard.
We were gonna pay him to watch the kids.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.974
But – I don't know now.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.519
Maybe you should drain the pool,
change the water.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.772
Won't the "methalanon"
contaminate the water?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.774
They sprayed again last night.

19:10.858 --> 19:15.195
It's safe, Mrs. Finnigan.
It's only toxic for a few hours.

19:15.279 --> 19:19.491
The water actually dilutes it,
so water's probably the safest place to be.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.411
So irresponsible. Casey has allergies.
The slightest thing sets him off.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.413
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mrs. Finnigan.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.166
Well, why don't you
come again Saturday?

19:28.251 --> 19:30.168
When's your next regular day?

19:30.253 --> 19:33.004
Tuesday.
I-I-I can't make it Saturday.

could treat my pool. Can you?

Can I what?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.683
Whatever you put in it
to kill the bug spray.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.435
I'll pay you.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.145
I'm afraid to go in.

19:49.272 --> 19:52.918
- I only have time to take care of my regular customers,
ma'am. I'm sorry. -Hey, Jerry, can I help with the pool today?

19:52.942 --> 19:56.755
- Casey, get back in the house. It's still dangerous
out here. -Well, maybe I'll become a regular customer.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.739
- Get ready for school.
- Have you seen my wallet?

These are the lionfish,

- Come on. I don't wanna miss that plane.
- Okay.

They've been good to us.
Don't smoke, Bill.

23:46.383 --> 23:49.362

a couple of drinks. And what do we do?

Where have you seen better?
Penthouse? I say that's money in the bank.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.157
- What do you think, Stuart?
- Not for breakfast.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.160
- Excuse me, honey.
- Yeah?

24:55.244 --> 24:59.247
Uh, could we have – What was it in the
bottom drawer over there you were getting?

24:59.331 --> 25:01.916
- What, butter?
- Yeah. Could we have more butter, please?

25:09.967 --> 25:12.886
Here you go.
Oh, hey, is my tuna melt workin'?

25:12.970 --> 25:15.889
Well, I'd say this trip's
off to a pretty good start.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.974
Yeah.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.186
I say the tuna melt works.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.189
- Cup of coffee.
- Yeah, okay.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.066
You know what we need?

25:27.151 --> 25:29.986
More, uh, you-know-what.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.072
Uh, could we have
some more butter, please?

- Out of butter.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.216
Ask for margarine.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.218
Well, then what did he do?

25:53.302 --> 25:56.221
He walks in at 7:30 in the morning.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.224
The kids are screaming.
They're happy to see him. Same old story.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.392
Sits down. He's acting
like nothing's happened.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.394
I have no explanation.
Nothing.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.397
- So he's out having breakfast with her.
- Are you serious?

26:06.482 --> 26:09.400
Yeah! I mean, I tried
to ask him where he was.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.402
- He gave me some –
- I'm going.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.738
- Where's he going?
- He's going to work. Okay.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.492
Gives me some ridiculous excuse
like – like crack kids –

And now I'm not even supposed to
say the word "crack" in front of them.

26:25.376 --> 26:28.211
Tell me about the Alex Trebek thing.
Did he flirt with you?

26:28.295 --> 26:30.213

26:38.055 --> 26:40.848
Will you get out of here!

26:42.351 --> 26:46.854
Sherri! The dog pissed
on the bed again, Sherri.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.607
Shoot him, man! Shoot him! He's crazy!

26:49.692 --> 26:51.609
Who are you talking to, anyway?

26:51.694 --> 26:54.946
Yeah, in those nice, tight pants he likes
'cause it makes his dick look big.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.241
What? I can't hear you.
The dog's barking.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.034
I'm talking to my sister.

- Where are you going, Gene?

27:08.043 --> 27:10.962
I thought you had
some time off this week.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.381
I gotta check on my work.
Quality control.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.133
Uh-huh.
How about tonight, Gene?

27:15.217 --> 27:17.135
Ahh!

27:17.219 --> 27:19.345
- Oh, God.
- Sherri.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.347
- Just a minute.
- Okay.

27:21.432 --> 27:24.350
You know what kind of work I do, right?
Look at me.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.314
You know it's dangerous.

27:29.398 --> 27:33.484
And you know there's things you can't know
for your own safety, right?

27:33.569 --> 27:36.070
I was just asking about dinner.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.576
Don't you worry
your pretty little head about it.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.333
- He's out of here.
- All right, kids.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.420
What is he talking about?

27:53.756 --> 27:56.632
- The king is gone.
- Come on, Suzy. Come on.

27:56.717 --> 28:01.179
Close the gate when you go! I don't want
Suzy to get out! He might get run over!

28:01.263 --> 28:03.222
Casey.

28:04.475 --> 28:07.393
You are gonna be late for school,
young man.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.355
- Now, do you want me to drive you?
- No. I'll walk.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.941
You sure?
All right, kisses. Okay.

29:03.534 --> 29:06.536
Oh, my God.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.705
Honey! Honey, you all right?

29:09.790 --> 29:11.707

- Wait, wait, wait!

29:11.792 --> 29:15.086
Let me get your stuff.
Here. Wait, I'll –

29:15.170 --> 29:17.672
- Come on, let's get in my car.
- No, I-I'm fine.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.675
My mom doesn't want me
to go in a car with strangers.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.679
No, wait a minute. Let me give you
a ride home, make sure you're okay.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.348
I'm – I'm fine. For sure.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.059
No, no. Look.

Come on. How old are you?

29:32.146 --> 29:34.605
I'm eight.
My birthday's tomorrow.

I wanna make sure you're okay.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.498
Hey, bye.

30:19.776 --> 30:23.029
- Have you got ready-made birthday cakes?
- Yeah. They're right here.

30:23.113 --> 30:26.032
- Have you got one with "Betty" on it already?
- Just what you see here.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.534
I can do something special,
but not for today.

30:28.619 --> 30:31.537
Yeah. Well, all right,
I'll take that one. What is it?

30:31.622 --> 30:34.540
- It's a lemon cake.
- Can you maybe put her name on it?

30:34.625 --> 30:37.543
- I can't do it today.
- All right. Well, how much is it?

30:37.628 --> 30:40.546
It's 14.75 with tax.
Mrs. Schwarzmeier, can you box this up?

30:40.631 --> 30:42.548
Jawohl, Herr Bitkower.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.052
Mrs. Schw – Could you maybe –
Could you just write "Betty" on here?

30:46.136 --> 30:48.346
"Betty"? No. No.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.353
- Hi.
- I'd like to order a birthday cake.

30:55.437 --> 30:57.415
- Sure. What kind?
- Birthdays. They keep adding up, huh?

30:57.439 --> 30:59.857
- Here is your cake and your change.
- Thanks.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.859
Oh, I've got a couple ideas here.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.862
- Okay, this is what I'd like.
- Mm-hmm.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.864
What's that say?
"Happy Birthday, Casey"?

31:06.949 --> 31:09.659
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yes. Casey.

31:09.743 --> 31:12.388
- And is that supposed to be a baseball bat?
- Hi, Mrs. Schwarzmeier.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.789
Yes, that's a baseball bat.
I don't draw very well.

31:14.915 --> 31:17.894
- I came to pick up the cake
for Debbie Eggenweiler.
Are you sure you want this?

31:17.918 --> 31:19.835
Because I have
some very nice baseball designs.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.837
- I think it's prepaid.
- Yes. Yes.

31:21.922 --> 31:25.341
- If you like this, I can do it.
- No, I like this.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.844
He's, um – He's starting Little League.
We're real excited.

31:28.929 --> 31:32.098
That's really sweet.
His name is Casey, and he plays baseball.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.851
- Down, down.
- No, no, no, no, no.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.860
Beautiful shot, man.

31:48.824 --> 31:53.327
Hey. Casey. What's up?
How come you're not in school?

31:53.412 --> 31:56.080
- Let him go.
- Hey, Casey, you wanna see the dribble?

31:56.164 --> 31:58.708
- Come on, Joe!
- Hey! Heads up!

31:58.792 --> 32:00.960

Honey? What happened?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.454
I got hit by a car.

35:23.538 --> 35:27.792
What? What do you mean,
you got hit by a car? Where? How?

35:27.876 --> 35:30.795
Casey, now you tell Mommy
exactly what happened.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.798
I got hit in the back

How fast was it going? Who hit you?

35:48.104 --> 35:51.357
She was a lady. She was nice.

Listen, honey,

35:53.568 --> 35:55.611
today...

35:55.695 --> 35:58.280
something terrible happened.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.658
I hit this little kid with my car.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.661
- Oh –
- He didn't get hurt. He was okay.

36:03.745 --> 36:08.666
- But, Jesus, it scared the hell out of me.
- Oh, Jesus. All right, were the cops there?

36:08.750 --> 36:10.668
I told you, he wasn't hurt.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.670
Okay. All right, listen.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.672
Did they get your name?

36:14.756 --> 36:17.675
I told you, nobody was there.
He's all right.

36:17.759 --> 36:20.678
Okay. All right.
I just don't wanna get sued.

36:20.762 --> 36:24.932
- It was just a stroke of luck I didn't kill him.
- I'm glad somebody's luck's holdin' out.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.686
Excuse me. Excuse me. Howard?
You have a phone call.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.688

What do you mean, hit by a car?
W-W-When? Where is he?

36:50.792 --> 36:53.544
Well, h-h-he's here.
He's home with me.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.796
He's – He's all right.
He's not hurt.

36:55.881 --> 37:00.759
Annie, calm down, start from the beginning
and tell me exactly what happened.

37:00.844 --> 37:03.178
Well, I put him in bed

37:03.263 --> 37:06.348
and h-h-he fell fast asleep.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.767
H-H-He's all right, I'm sure.

37:08.852 --> 37:12.021
Why'd you let him go to sleep?
You shouldn't have done that, honey.

37:12.105 --> 37:15.399
Je-Jesus Christ! I mean, wh –
W-Who hit him? How did this happen?

37:15.483 --> 37:19.445
I don't know!
I came home and he was here.

37:19.529 --> 37:24.033
I – He went to sleep.
I-I should let him sleep, shouldn't I?

37:24.117 --> 37:26.952
No. No, you wake him up
and you take him to the emergency room.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.829
You gotta get him looked at right away.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.123
Call Bob Winslow.
No, wait, I'll call him.

37:31.207 --> 37:34.126
Um, just hang up the phone.
I'll call you right back. Okay?

37:34.210 --> 37:37.504
- All right. I understand.
- Okay. Don't worry.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.007
Everything's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be fine.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.553

38:02.322 --> 38:05.616

38:10.914 --> 38:12.957
Fortunately, most are harmless.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.960
But some are very serious.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.963
He's eight years old. I asked him.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.465
Tomorrow's his birthday.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.676
Such a close call.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.679
Everything could have changed.
Our whole lives could have changed.

38:26.763 --> 38:30.766
Yeah, well, I wish somethin'
would come along and change our life.

38:32.769 --> 38:36.021
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothin'.

38:37.023 --> 38:41.360
Look, maybe I'm just sick and tired
of watching you show off your ass at work.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.738
Oh, you're drunk. And you lied to me.
Get the hell out of here.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.908
You want me out of here?
You got it.

38:48.827 --> 38:52.246
You told me you weren't gonna lie no more.
That was the deal – no more lies.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.248
Okay. Watch me go, baby.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.752
You know, a lot of guys don't like a big ass
in their face when they're trying to eat.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.755
Oh, pick a fight. Go ahead.
Pick a fight with me.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.759
Tell you something –

39:05.844 --> 39:09.596
I don't know who you think would wanna
look at your sad, middle-aged ass anyway.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.599
Don't you talk to me like that.
And don't you come back here.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.602
I'm not taking you back no more.
You understand? No more!

39:15.687 --> 39:18.605
- No more I'm not taking you back!
- I'm not coming back!

39:18.690 --> 39:21.608
- Slobberin' all over Honey like that.
- I never touched Honey!

39:21.693 --> 39:24.570
I didn't say you touched her!
I said you slobbered on her!

39:24.696 --> 39:28.175

your wedding ring to work anymore?
-Oh, you're such a bullshit artist.

at our mansion of love, baby, not me!

39:31.369 --> 39:34.288

and pee on Irmadine's drapes again!

39:34.372 --> 39:38.459
I'm gonna go get drunk!
I'm gonna get drunk right now, goddamn it!

39:41.629 --> 39:44.214

42:39.974 --> 42:41.975
- It's for me.
- Sure, Doctor.

42:44.520 --> 42:49.775
He's got a small blood clot, a little brain
swelling, but it probably won't require surgery.

42:49.859 --> 42:53.070
He's aspirated,
but we're not too concerned about that.

42:53.154 --> 42:56.073

43:02.830 --> 43:06.083

It's gonna be all right, honey.

43:06.167 --> 43:08.210

- Three more.

43:09.337 --> 43:12.256
Damn shame you can't feel safe
driving in this city no more.

43:12.340 --> 43:15.259
His vital signs are good. We're just
gonna have to wait till he wakes up.

43:15.343 --> 43:18.762
Is there something we could do?
Something we should do?

43:18.846 --> 43:21.765
You can wait.
There's a waiting room down the hall.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.768
There's smoking out on the porch,
if you want to smoke.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.771
He may be waking up soon.
You'll wanna be here when he does.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.483
Yeah, well, uh, listen, how –
how long you think it'll – it'll be?

43:31.567 --> 43:35.821
You never know with these things. I just want
you to do whatever makes you comfortable.

43:35.905 --> 43:39.199
Come on, come on, come on!

43:39.284 --> 43:41.618
- You made it.
- Yeah!

43:43.079 --> 43:45.998
I hope you don't have to
put too much chlorine in.

43:46.082 --> 43:48.000
It's bad for my voice.

43:48.084 --> 43:50.085
The pool's around the back.

43:54.590 --> 43:57.009
Jonathan, that's you, babe!
Go up, go up!

43:57.093 --> 43:59.803
- Right here, right here, right here!
- Zoe!

44:00.930 --> 44:02.848
Excuse me.

44:02.932 --> 44:05.475
Um, see how that bruise is – is –

44:05.560 --> 44:07.978
it's intense, but it's not glowing.

44:08.062 --> 44:11.189
So you'll wanna work on that.
Let's take a look at yours.

44:11.274 --> 44:14.526
This is good. I like that. Yeah.
The bruise is really good.

44:14.610 --> 44:19.531
Um – I want you to
put a little bit more blood in there.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.533
Oh, on the – on the, uh – on –

44:21.617 --> 44:23.535
Yeah, blend off that one edge.

44:23.619 --> 44:26.038
- And take the brush out of your mouth.
- Sorry.

44:26.122 --> 44:28.540
Filter? What's the filter
got to do with it?

44:28.624 --> 44:32.210
Well, if your filter ain't workin', and I
don't think it is, there's not much I can do.

44:32.295 --> 44:35.380
How dangerous is this malathion?

44:35.465 --> 44:38.383
Well – How long
have you had this system?

44:38.468 --> 44:40.385
Came with the house.

44:40.470 --> 44:45.682
Yeah? Well, I hate to be the one to tell
you, but I think it's on its last legs.

44:45.767 --> 44:48.185
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

44:48.353 --> 44:51.688
- So, Ace, what's up tonight?
- I don't know. What do you wanna do?

44:51.773 --> 44:55.359
I mean, with Mom. Is she celebrating
her birthday alone, or what?

44:55.443 --> 44:57.944
Uh, with Gene.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.946
- Jean, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

45:00.031 --> 45:01.948
Jean.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.950
Jean.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.744
Well, who's she?

45:05.828 --> 45:08.121
He's a friend of Mommy's.

45:08.206 --> 45:10.874
What do we do now?

45:33.898 --> 45:36.900
May I see your license
and registration, ma'am?

45:44.325 --> 45:47.452
- Did I do something wrong, Officer?
- Take your sunglasses off, ma'am.

45:54.502 --> 45:57.087
You know, this clown is detachable.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.423
I, um – I have a permit for it.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.985
It's to code. I've been stopped before.
There's never been a problem.

46:02.009 --> 46:06.430
- Phone number, ma'am?
- 504-0361.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.642
I'm gonna let you go
with a warning this time, ma'am.

46:10.726 --> 46:14.688
You were driving too slow.
Just as dangerous as driving too fast.

46:16.399 --> 46:19.401
Please refrain from doing so
in the future.

46:23.531 --> 46:25.449
Can I go now?

46:25.533 --> 46:28.452
No, ma'am.
I have one more question.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.537
What's that?

46:32.081 --> 46:35.000
How many clowns
can you fit in this car?

46:35.084 --> 46:37.002
I beg your pardon.

46:37.086 --> 46:40.130
How many clowns
can you fit in this car, ma'am?

46:40.214 --> 46:42.632
Why'd you take my phone number?

46:42.717 --> 46:46.761
Well, you never know when you might
need the services of a clown, ma'am.

46:46.846 --> 46:49.306
- You have children?
- No, ma'am.

46:49.390 --> 46:54.144
I, uh – I can use some cheering up
from time to time myself, ma'am.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.271
Being a cop isn't easy.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.356
You have a nice day now.

47:01.777 --> 47:05.071
If there's anything I like more
than being mean,

47:05.156 --> 47:07.699
it's being sneaky.

47:10.369 --> 47:12.287
It's a trap!

47:12.371 --> 47:15.957
- Of course it's a trap!
- Gene?

47:16.042 --> 47:18.460
- Is that you?
- Affirmative!

47:18.544 --> 47:20.962
With the Planeteers out of our way –

47:21.047 --> 47:22.964
Chad left the TV on.

47:25.051 --> 47:27.969
Man dares to go
where only cows have gone before.

47:28.054 --> 47:31.515
Bandini is the word for fertilizer.

47:32.517 --> 47:35.644
Oh, my God!
Chad, what are you doing here?

47:35.728 --> 47:38.355
- Where's your dad?
- He had to go somewhere.

47:38.439 --> 47:40.815
He had to go somewhere without you?

47:40.900 --> 47:43.026
He said he had to do something.

47:43.110 --> 47:44.903
- Something came up.
- Yeah.

47:44.987 --> 47:46.905
I'll bet it did.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.366
I'll bet something came up.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.368
So, what'd he say about you?

47:51.452 --> 47:54.371
He said we'll have to do it
some other time.

47:54.455 --> 47:56.289
Hey.

47:56.374 --> 47:58.375
He's a son of a bitch.

47:59.460 --> 48:03.672
He's a son of a bitch.

48:17.562 --> 48:20.230
- Now?
- Bring in the –

48:28.823 --> 48:30.740
Jerry Kaiser.

48:30.825 --> 48:32.742
- Hey, buddy, it's me.
- Hey.

48:32.827 --> 48:35.745
Listen, I'm walking around
with a fuckin' serious chubby.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.706
Listen to what's going on.

48:37.790 --> 48:39.708
There's this girl here –

48:39.792 --> 48:43.587
She's 18, she's got a body to kill for,
beautiful face, and she asked me –

48:43.671 --> 48:46.590
- Why are you whispering?
- To do her body makeup for this –

48:46.674 --> 48:49.593
I'm not whispering. I'm just –
I'm – I'm throaty. I'm excited.

48:49.677 --> 48:53.305
So I gotta do full-body makeup on her.
That takes an hour.

48:53.389 --> 48:57.934
That means I'm rubbing base
up and down the insides of her thighs,

48:58.019 --> 48:59.894
like, right around her puddy,

48:59.979 --> 49:01.896
and I'm just like, "Oh, man!"

49:01.981 --> 49:05.275
I gotta run it up and down, up her –
on the inside of her elastic

49:05.359 --> 49:07.527
and inside her perfect ass.

49:07.612 --> 49:10.030
I'm just, like – I'm losing it, man.

49:10.114 --> 49:13.825
I was, like, rubbing some on her titties and
she looked at me and said, "What's your name?"

49:13.909 --> 49:15.952
I said, "My name is Bill."

49:16.037 --> 49:18.913
She said,
"Bill, you're giving me a nipple boner."

49:18.998 --> 49:20.915
I said, "That's right."

49:21.000 --> 49:24.294
And I was just, like – I was about to
drop my brushes and just fuckin' –

49:24.378 --> 49:27.964
Oh! It was amazing.
What do you think about that, man?

49:28.049 --> 49:30.467
Pretty amazing – Jerry?

49:30.551 --> 49:33.053
Jerry? Kaiser?

49:41.228 --> 49:44.147
Oh – Uh, d-did you get a good grade?

49:44.231 --> 49:46.816
Yeah, they gave me an A-plus, baby.

49:46.901 --> 49:49.235
- That's great.
- Why are you whispering?

49:49.320 --> 49:51.237
- Shh! Shh, shh.
- What? What are you doing?

49:51.322 --> 49:53.239
I told you! I'm working.

49:53.324 --> 49:56.303
You don't sound like you're – What are
you doing, waiting for some rich dame –

49:56.327 --> 49:58.828
Okay, I gotta go.
I'll call you back later. Bye.

50:06.462 --> 50:08.505
I wish you wouldn't do that.

50:09.632 --> 50:12.217
You're not fooling me, you know.

50:34.448 --> 50:37.427
Stuart, nothing counts against first, most
or biggest unless we're all fishin', man.

50:37.451 --> 50:40.370
I'm just settin' up
this new line. All right?

50:40.454 --> 50:43.623
What about somebody –
What about setting up the camp here?

50:43.708 --> 50:45.625
Somebody's gotta dig the hole.

50:45.710 --> 50:49.129
I'll do that!
Just give me a couple of minutes here!

50:49.213 --> 50:52.132
I'll help you.
Just let me take a leak first.

50:52.216 --> 50:55.427
Hey, don't piss on any firewood!

50:55.511 --> 50:58.054
Yeah, and don't piss in the water!

50:58.139 --> 51:01.099
♪♪

51:11.110 --> 51:13.236
Shit.

51:16.991 --> 51:19.868
What are you
pissin' in the water for, Vern?

51:19.952 --> 51:22.454
I kinda like the way it sounds.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.420
Hey.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.672
Hey, Stuart, Gordon.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.674
Come here a second.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.302
What the hell is this?
Stuart, come here!

51:37.386 --> 51:39.637
Gordon, get over here!

51:39.722 --> 51:42.265
Holy Christ! It's a dead body!

51:44.518 --> 51:47.061
Look at that. Jesus!

51:48.606 --> 51:50.523
Who do you think it is?

51:50.608 --> 51:54.360
- It's a dead body, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's a woman, huh?

51:54.445 --> 51:56.362
She's dead, isn't she?

51:56.447 --> 51:58.865
Yeah, dead. I'll say. Look at her.

51:58.949 --> 52:01.284
I wonder how.

52:01.368 --> 52:03.244
We gotta pull her out.

52:03.329 --> 52:07.332
Pull her out? What are you, crazy? I don't
think we should touch her. Should we?

52:07.416 --> 52:10.168
No, we should call somebody.
I think we should call the police.

52:10.252 --> 52:13.046
I don't think we should touch anything
until we call somebody.

52:13.130 --> 52:17.967
Great idea. How we gonna do that? You got
a portable cellular phone or something?

52:18.052 --> 52:21.638
We can't just leave her there, can we?

52:21.722 --> 52:24.140
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.

52:24.225 --> 52:26.142
I'm gonna have a drink.

52:26.227 --> 52:29.646
Uh, I think Vern has the right idea.

52:29.730 --> 52:32.315
Hey, wait – wait a minute!

52:35.194 --> 52:39.113
Why don't you go home, get some rest?
I'll call you if there's any change.

52:39.198 --> 52:43.451
No, you go. I'll stay. You go rest up.
You've got things at the station.

52:43.536 --> 52:45.453
I'm all right.

52:45.538 --> 52:47.455
I could make some calls.

52:47.540 --> 52:49.457
Probably a good time.

52:49.542 --> 52:52.460
Look, I'll take the number
of the pay phone here.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.170
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

52:54.255 --> 52:56.464
Sometimes it takes forever
to get through here.

52:56.549 --> 52:59.968
Uh, could you bring me some shoes –
some flats – and a sweater?

53:00.052 --> 53:01.970
And maybe some mail?

53:02.054 --> 53:03.972
Magazines or something?

53:04.056 --> 53:05.974
It's gonna be all right.

53:06.058 --> 53:07.642
Bye.

53:21.323 --> 53:23.241
- Marian?
- What? What's the matter?

53:23.325 --> 53:26.244
Something horrible's happened.
This has been the worst day of my life.

53:26.328 --> 53:29.247
Oh, my God.
What happened, Sherri? Tell me.

53:29.331 --> 53:32.375
- Suzy ran away.
- Oh, Jesus.

53:32.459 --> 53:35.712
I thought you were gonna say something
happened to one of the kids, or to Gene.

53:35.796 --> 53:38.775
- It's Gene's fault. He's the one who let him out.
- Oh, I'm sure you'll find her.

53:38.799 --> 53:40.216
- Him.
- Yeah.

53:40.301 --> 53:43.219
I've been going up and down the streets
all day trying to find him.

53:43.304 --> 53:46.222
- Kids are going nuts.
- Did you call the pound?

53:46.307 --> 53:48.725
- Dad, Suzy's gone!
- I called everyone I could think of.

53:48.809 --> 53:52.604
- Honey, he's out running around. Don't worry.
- No, Daddy, he's really gone!

53:52.688 --> 53:55.815
Honey, he'll come back when he's ready.
Don't worry.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.984
Daddy, we looked and looked.

53:58.068 --> 54:03.281
Sweetheart, Suzy will be back
as soon as he gets hungry.

54:03.365 --> 54:06.284
Daddy, I want Suzy back!

54:06.368 --> 54:08.578
Daddy, we can't find Suzy!

54:08.662 --> 54:11.581
Listen to me, all of you.
Suzy will come back sometime.

54:11.665 --> 54:15.543
- What if she doesn't?
- Well, then we'll have to get another dog.

54:15.628 --> 54:19.464
- We'll get a puppy this time. How's that?
- I don't want another dog. I want Suzy!

54:19.548 --> 54:21.841
I want Suzy!

54:21.926 --> 54:24.844
- Tell me how much you want it.
- Put those on my side.

54:24.929 --> 54:26.846
Why should I, Big?

54:26.931 --> 54:29.766
Still got three fingers in your ass?

54:29.850 --> 54:32.143
Slut. I should make you get an egg.

54:32.227 --> 54:34.979
You got an egg in that refrigerator?

54:35.064 --> 54:36.981
No, you don't got an egg?

54:37.066 --> 54:39.692
- What about a candle?
- Candle.

54:39.777 --> 54:42.695
What about them rubber bands
I told you about?

54:42.780 --> 54:45.698
I don't think you got 'em tight enough.
Snap 'em!

54:45.783 --> 54:47.700
- Good.
- Okay. Geez!

54:47.785 --> 54:50.495
Okay, take them rubber bands
off your dick.

54:50.579 --> 54:52.497
I'm gonna suck your dick now.

54:52.581 --> 54:55.166
I'm gonna introduce your dick
to my tonsils.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.168
Sit back down. Joe, now!

54:57.252 --> 54:59.712
- Baby –
- How long you gonna stay on that phone, Lois?

54:59.797 --> 55:02.215
- Sit down. Look at the cards.
- Say, "Please, mistress."

55:02.299 --> 55:04.968
- Sit down.
- I didn't tell you to come!

55:05.052 --> 55:07.720
So tell me, how did it feel?

55:07.805 --> 55:11.391
Next time I'm gonna make you
get a Q-Tip with some aftershave

55:11.475 --> 55:14.686
and I'm gonna make you
stick it up that dick of yours.

55:14.770 --> 55:17.605
3:30 Wednesday.
Call me, bitch.

55:18.732 --> 55:20.733
Bend the card!

55:24.321 --> 55:25.905
They don't want another dog.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.907
- Well, neither do I.
- Neither do I.

55:27.992 --> 55:29.659
- Neither do I.
- Neither do I!

55:29.743 --> 55:31.369
- Neither do I!
- I! I! I!

55:31.453 --> 55:33.579
I!

55:35.499 --> 55:38.418
I don't even see
what the difference is.

55:38.502 --> 55:41.421
They're not even gonna know
who Suzy is in a week.

55:41.505 --> 55:46.676
Let's take the kids, put them in the car,
drive around and see if anybody's seen him.

55:46.760 --> 55:49.387
- Can't do it. I got plans.
- Oh, Gene, come on!

55:49.471 --> 55:51.889
Sherri, I told you
a week and a half ago,

55:51.974 --> 55:55.977
I got the leadership council thing
on the crack kids.

55:58.272 --> 56:01.190
What you should do is,
you should go out with the kids,

56:01.275 --> 56:03.901
put up some signs, offer a reward –
not too much.

56:03.986 --> 56:06.529
- Remember, it's a dog.
- Who's Claire "The Clown" Kane?

56:07.781 --> 56:10.199
What are you doing
looking in my pockets?

56:10.284 --> 56:13.202
What are you doing with
her driver's license and telephone number?

56:15.039 --> 56:17.623
You wanna know? I'll tell you.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.710
Claire Kane, aka "The Clown,"

56:21.754 --> 56:24.589
is a bunco artist
wanted in three states.

56:24.673 --> 56:28.885
I have her phone number because I'm
running a sting operation. Now you know.

56:28.969 --> 56:31.387
And now, unfortunately,

56:31.472 --> 56:35.475
I have compromised your safety
and the children's safety.

56:35.559 --> 56:37.560
Are you happy now?

56:44.651 --> 56:47.487
There is a –
a hard, heavy physicality

56:47.571 --> 56:49.489
in my new paintings

56:49.573 --> 56:53.367
in part because I've executed them
on large panels of wood,

56:53.452 --> 56:55.745
but I'd say that they're tempered by the –

56:55.829 --> 56:58.331
- Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.

56:58.415 --> 57:01.042
Um, tempered by
the ephemeral use of color.

57:01.126 --> 57:03.294
You could almost say
that it's beyond natural color.

57:03.378 --> 57:05.630
What are they about?

57:05.714 --> 57:09.383
Well –
I think they're about seeing

57:09.468 --> 57:12.428
and the responsibility
that comes with that.

57:12.513 --> 57:15.181
- Okay.
- And call next week.

57:15.265 --> 57:18.518
- Thanks. Thank you very much.
- Bye.

57:18.602 --> 57:20.103
Bye-bye.

57:21.355 --> 57:23.606
Who was that? Sherri?

57:23.690 --> 57:25.942
No, that was David

57:26.026 --> 57:27.652
at the gallery.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.613
Oh. David at the gallery.

57:30.697 --> 57:33.032
I'm hoping to get a show there.

57:33.117 --> 57:36.869
Is this "David at the gallery" going to be
another Mitchell Anderson in our lives?

57:37.955 --> 57:39.664
What's that supposed to mean?

57:39.748 --> 57:42.959
Well, that's the sort of stuff you two
used to blather on about, isn't it?

57:43.043 --> 57:45.169
What are you talking about?

57:46.046 --> 57:49.507
The lousy painter. The one who never
sold anything. Mitchell Anderson.

57:52.219 --> 57:55.805
Just because he never sold anything
doesn't mean he was a lousy painter.

57:55.889 --> 57:57.223
So you've said.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.600
Well, it's true.

57:59.685 --> 58:01.936
You know, scientifically speaking, Marian,

58:02.020 --> 58:05.022
there's no such thing
as "beyond natural color."

58:05.107 --> 58:08.025
I don't know why we're sittin'
around here, actin' like it was our fault.

58:08.110 --> 58:10.528
We didn't have anything to do with it.

58:10.612 --> 58:12.989
Yeah. Suppose we'd never
come up here in the first place.

58:13.073 --> 58:17.243
When would she have been found?
Maybe never. Nothing we can do to help.

58:17.327 --> 58:21.247
She must have been murdered.
I mean, she's naked and everything.

58:21.331 --> 58:24.750
Nothing we're gonna
do about it tonight, anyway.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.752
Suppose it floats away.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.754
Then it's out of our hands.

58:28.839 --> 58:32.258
Maybe that's what we oughta do – kick
it loose and let somebody else find it.

58:32.342 --> 58:36.637
Ah, I don't know. I think we
oughta tie it up so it won't float away.

58:36.722 --> 58:40.141
Then we can, uh, you know,
deal with it in the morning.

58:40.225 --> 58:42.143
What do you say about that?

58:42.227 --> 58:45.646
I say we got two hours of prime trout
time left. That's what we oughta deal with.

58:45.731 --> 58:48.649
Hey, let's take a vote.

58:48.734 --> 58:50.651
All right by me.

58:50.736 --> 58:53.654
Fish now, or deal with the body.

58:53.739 --> 58:55.656
I say fish now.

58:55.741 --> 58:58.659
Suppose the current takes it away.

58:58.744 --> 59:00.745
Then it's not our problem.

59:02.080 --> 59:05.541
The Planeteers are trying to
save the planet and the environment.

59:05.626 --> 59:08.544
Uh, they're all wonderful characters.

59:08.629 --> 59:11.881
- Tell Gene where he comes from.
- The tropical rain forest.

59:11.965 --> 59:13.883
- This one?
- This is Ma-Ti.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.885
His power is heart.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.471
Let's see. Where is his ring?
They all come with little –

59:18.555 --> 59:21.451
- Stormy did this on purpose. I'm gonna kill him.
- This is Kwame. He has the power of earth.

59:21.475 --> 59:25.269
Let's say he points his ring
at, maybe, Earth, and –

59:25.354 --> 59:27.647
Chad, you know what?

59:27.731 --> 59:30.858
I think that it was really nice
that Gene brought us here tonight

59:30.943 --> 59:32.818
and I think we should say
thank you.

59:32.903 --> 59:36.405
- Don't you?
- Mommy, can I go to the bathroom, please?

59:36.490 --> 59:37.990
Yeah.

59:39.076 --> 59:42.620
- Wait. Where is it?
- Uh, excuse me, miss.

59:42.704 --> 59:44.622
Where's the restroom?

59:44.706 --> 59:46.624
- For him? I'll take him.
- Thanks.

59:46.708 --> 59:48.709
Come on. I'll show you.

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:04.100
What's that?

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.477
- What?
- That.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.731
Happy birthday.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:13.484
What is it? An alarm clock?

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:15.569
It's pretty.

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:20.366
My marriage is breaking up.

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:23.369
- Oh, honey, really?
- Really.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:27.331
I can't think of anything but you.

01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:30.334
Not at work, not about the trial.

01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:31.877
Just you.

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:34.422
I think I'm, uh –

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.009
I think I'm, uh, getting serious.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:41.429
Oh, honey, I wanna be with you too.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.815
- Hello.
- Mrs. Finnigan, please.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.817
Uh, sorry, she's not here right now.

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:57.278
- Who's this?
- This is Mr. Bitkower.

01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:01.282
She placed an order today, and I just wanted to
make sure I was clear about what she wanted.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.284
Her drawing's a little messy.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:06.704
Well, she isn't here right now.
Call her back next week. All right?

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.555
Hello.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.892
I don't appreciate being hung up on
when I'm calling about your order.

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:32.063
I need to know whether Mrs. Finnigan
wanted a bat or a mitt. May I speak to her?

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:35.566
No, you may not. Whatever it is,
just cancel it and stop calling here.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.568
Now, we've got a problem here.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:40.654
We don't need the line tied up
with unimportant stuff!

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.251
Either you give me an answer now –

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:57.046
Look, fuck you, asshole.
Fuck you!

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:02.510
Jesus.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.436
Goddamn it!

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.779
All right, tomorrow night
we'll get a motel room.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.781
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:26.283
Oh, no, I can't.
I'm going away for the weekend.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:28.786
- What?
- Goin' to Tahoe, see my sister.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.997
- Tahoe? When did that get decided on?
- I don't know. Last week.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.208
Your sister?

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.354
- Thought your sister lived in Michigan.
- That's Phyllis.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:39.296
- This is Bunny. Bunny lives in Tahoe.
- Bunny? Who's Bunny?

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.298
You never mentioned her before.

01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:43.634
- Yes, I did. She's my half sister.
- Half sister?

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:46.804
And besi – Gene, you were always
with your family on the weekend.

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:49.890
How was I supposed to know
you could get away?

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.519
Oh, well –

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:56.856
I don't know what to think, Betty.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.483
Huh.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.197
So, is B – Who is Bunny?

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:06.490
- Bunny –
- Bunny – Who's –

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:09.827
- Bunny is my half-stepsister.
- Is this your mother's kid or your father's kid?

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.412
- My dad's wife's kid.
- Oh, yeah.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.516
We have been planning
to get together for over a year.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.460
- Oh, yeah? Well, what's she do in Tahoe?
- What?

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:18.043
What does she do in Tahoe?

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.880
She work? Is she married?

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:24.300
- Tahoe's a fancy place to live, you know.
- Gene, stop this.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:28.637
I'm going away for a few days
to visit my sister.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:32.099
Don't try to make me feel guilty
about nothing.

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:34.101
You're making mountains out of molehills.

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:36.896
- Come on –
- Shh. Kid's back.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.939
There's this really neat camera up front.

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:41.002
- It's not a real camera.
- Did you find the bathroom okay?

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.818
Uh, yeah. There's a man
throwing up in there.

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:46.030
- Oh, my God. How awful. Is he all right?
- Chad.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:48.657
- I don't know.
- You going to visit Aunt Bunny this weekend?

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.993
How about those peas?
Let's eat up some of those peas.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.538
- Bunny?
- He's too young to remember Bunny, okay?

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:57.458
Does not remember Bunny.
Eat 'em up.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:04:01.837
Anyway, it squirts water –
It looks like a real camera. Please?

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:05.049
I really want it.
Come on. Daddy would buy it for me.

6'4", 6'5". Eddie Valdez.
We called him "Big Ed."

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:37.706
I said, "Big Ed, yo, listen.
Don't fuck with me."

fooling around with a dead body up here,

- You scared me.

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:34.939

- Why did you sneak up on me?

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.296

- I'm ditching.

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:38.924
I wanna see you. It's true.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.069
- You've got to go to class.
- Are you snoopin' around?

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:44.740
- All you're supposed to do is just feed the fish.
- Look at this one, though. Look at this one.

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.724

You respect their privacy.

You know what?

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.805

- No.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.891
- And really – Yeah.
- We can't do that.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:31.435

I wanted to do this trick
for my grandson.

Olla filled me in on

- Olla?
- Yeah, Olla.

01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:58.530
- How's the boy?
- Well, he has a head injury –

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:01.074
a little clot and some swelling.

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:04.786
But they don't have to operate. We're a
little worried because he won't wake up.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.579
- Oh.
- So you're Howard's dad?

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:10.292
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, it was very thoughtful of you to come by.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:12.585
Yeah. Oh, hey, hey.
I was gonna come by.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.671
But I just heard about this now.

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:18.633

You know, uh, Kevin – It's, uh –

- Well, we're –

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:29.561
We're very worried.
You know, he – he – he won't wake up.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:34.482
Uh, but other than that, he doesn't
have any broken bones, so –

Howard's doing real good.

So, when did you last –

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:23.758
So, when did you talk to him last?

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:26.428
He lives in Riverside.
That's not that far away.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:30.098
I don't know. This is as much of a surprise
to me as it is to anybody.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:34.894
I mean, I haven't seen him in years.
I haven't talked to him since the divorce.

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:39.524

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:37.207
Well, I-I'm gonna go back with Casey.
It was nice to meet you.

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:40.835
- Yeah, wasn't it?
- I'll see you back there, honey.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.213
Well, at least
he came home last night.

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:45.215
That's more than
I can say for the dog.

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:48.051
Why don't you say something to him?
Tell him what you think.

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:50.261
Oh, he'd just deny it.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:52.263
If I start to get specific
about things,

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:55.016
he starts screaming about
what kind of job he has.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.185
He's a pathological liar.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.064
To tell you the truth,
I'm more worried about the dog.

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:04.234
- Mm-hmm. I know what you mean.
- Hi, Sherri. How are the kids?

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:07.320
They lost their dog.
Suzy ran away.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:09.364
That's a shame.
She'll probably be back.

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:11.366
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.535
It's a he. Suzy's a boy.

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.787
Yeah, yeah.
That's – That's what I meant.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:19.332
What are you doing home?
You're not supposed to be home now.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:22.710
Oh, w-we have –
we have that thing with the, uh –

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:25.421
You know, the, uh,
the husband and wife?

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:27.423
- Kanes.
- Who are the Kanes?

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.551
They're these people
that we met at the concert.

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:32.387
They have tickets next to us.
It's not tonight. It's tomorrow night.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:35.807
Remember? He's going fishing.
We're gonna eat his fish.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.976
Tomorrow? Oh, shit!

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.978
Excuse me, Sherri. Um –

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:43.124
I told Sherri I'd go home, have dinner with
her and the kids. They're really upset.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.900
Ralph, you're welcome to come.
But Gene's not gonna be there.

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:48.746
I don't think you want to come, honey.
You don't want to come, do you?

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.030
You don't want to come, do you?

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:53.408
No. No, I-I-I can't.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:55.910
I've got, uh, work.

01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:57.954
Some lemons.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:09.090
I will for a little bit.
Maybe he'll wake up if I'm not here.

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:11.467
Yeah. Well, when you get home,
just s-sit and rest,

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:14.762
or get something to eat,
or just have a bath.

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:18.725
And let's try to, uh,
just, uh, forget about it, okay?

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:21.811
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:25.231
Uh, excuse me. I think – Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were asleep.

01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:28.943
I think your son is in the room
next to my grandson, you know?

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:31.446
At least, I assume it's your son.
I'm not from around here.

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.948
I'm just here because
the kid got hit by a car.

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:37.076
Uh, are you the father
of that newsman on Channel 9?

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.078
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:42.123
- Yeah. Well, I'm Knute. This is my wife, Dora.
- Oh, hi. Paul Finnigan.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:45.877
- Oh, that's your wife? You two –
- I'm sorry to hear about your grandson.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.212
Yeah, he got a cracked skull
and a concussion.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.131
- Oh, no.
- He's gonna be all right.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.693
But they said he's in shock right now.

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:54.636
- I – I –
- Well, our son, Brian –

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.971
- Well, he's been operated on twice.
- Twice.

01:22:57.056 --> 01:22:59.307
- No kidding.
- Somebody shot him on the freeway.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.017
- What?
- Yes.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:04.122
- Just driving along, minding his own business.
- Driving along, minding his own business.

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:06.625
- And somebody shot him.
- Oh, my God. What's the world coming to?

01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:08.775
I don't know.
Nobody knows who did it.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:11.819
Jesus. Well, ours was like
a hit-and-run too.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.626
A recent graduate of Seton Hall University,

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:29.921
he drank every day of his college life.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.923
- Beer and Jack Daniel's.
- Mom?

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.175
- Yeah, I'm in here.
- Not necessarily together.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.010
- He still loves to get buzzed.
- Hi.

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:39.639
He doesn't do it quite as much.
But he's not about to give up drinking.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.516
- Hi.
- Shh. I'm watching.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.601
- What are you watching?
- Don't call it a disease.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:46.479
- Why do you like that guy?
- Phil? I love him.

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:48.981
- Got you something.
- Huh?

01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:52.860
- Look.
- Oh, cute. Goldfish. Haven't seen those in years.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:54.904
Aren't those nice?

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:57.573
- I'll set it up for ya.
- How you feed 'em?

01:23:57.658 --> 01:23:59.575
I'll show ya.

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.994
Jesus. Ma, it smells like a bar in here.

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:07.375
Well, Earl's startin' on another one.
I don't know if I can take it anymore.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.711
He gets so mean. Didn't use to.

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:12.046
We used to have a good time
when we drank.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.465
How long you gonna
let that guy ruin your life?

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:21.389
Mom, what are you doing smoking?
You said you quit.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:24.058
I can't quit smokin' when I got
a lot of other stuff goin' on.

01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:26.728
Why don't you think about yourself
for a change, huh?

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:30.940
- I got to think about Earl.
- Mom, he is a – he is a pig. Do you know that?

01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:32.650
He's a drunken, stupid pig.

01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:34.902
I don't want you to talk that way
about your father.

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.988
He's not my father.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.990
Well, he's my husband.
Don't you forget it.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:42.452
He's an asshole.
I know, Mom.

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:45.163
- Believe me, I know. He's a –
- You don't know.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:47.248
I don't want to hear that anymore.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:49.250
You told that story one time too many.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:53.296
Look at me. He was drunk anyway,
and you know it.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.549
He's all I've got. I need company.

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:59.051
We're addicted to addiction.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:03.765
Honey, yesterday I hit a kid.

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:06.267
- What?
- I hit an eight-year-old kid.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:08.811
He wasn't hurt. I just kind of brushed him,
knocked him down.

01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:12.356
But it was so close.
He's such a little sweetie too.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:15.443
I tried to give him a lift to his house.
He told me his mom and dad told him

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:18.089
never to get into the car with anybody
unless they said it was okay.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:21.365
Oh. You're very lucky.
You know that?

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:24.994
If I'd been going faster,
I would've killed him.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.996
Imagine.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.208
How could you get over that?
You couldn't.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:35.213
I came home. I told Earl
our whole life could change.

01:25:35.297 --> 01:25:37.632
Earl tells me to go on a diet.

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.634
That's all he could think of to say.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:50.728
Hey!

01:25:57.402 --> 01:26:00.238
I tell ya? Did I tell ya?

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:02.240
That's the best fishing I've ever had.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:04.325
Yeah, but I lost four
of those motherfuckers.

01:26:06.954 --> 01:26:12.083
Yeah, but tell me it wasn't worth it. I mean,
even four hours of walking is worth this.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.668
Yeah.

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.921
Yeah, but what are we gonna...

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:19.006
do about you-know-what?

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.803
I'm gonna take another picture.

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.624
Okay. Uh, right there, bring it down a little
bit. Right on the cantabile. A little bit down.

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:56.878
Zoe, i-i-is that bothering you?

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:59.463
- It looks terrible.
- Oh, no.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.966
- Can we start right –
- How did you do that?

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.844
Um, I fell carrying my mom's lunch tray.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:07.555
- Can we start right at – at –
- By the way, how is your mother?

01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:11.642
- Is – Is she all right?
- No.

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:16.314
I don't think she's got much time left. I – I
can see her change right in front of my eyes.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:19.942
It's a cruel disease.
Can – Can we start at number six?

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.986
Okay. Number six.

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:43.674
Ah.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:53.434
- Hello? Howard?
- No, this is not Howard.

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.603
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who are you calling?

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:57.855
Casey.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.942
I want to talk about
that little bastard Casey.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.444
Casey? Who is this?

01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:07.365
Hello?

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.367
Hello?

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.506
This is good. Is that Suzy?

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.718
Is that her tail?
That's nice. I really like that.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:52.887
- Marian.
- Okay.

01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:59.101
- Don't let the kids see.
- Why?

01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:01.562
'Cause I don't want to hear
Gene's bullshit.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:03.147
No!

01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:07.902
He's playing around.
I can smell it on him.

01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:10.488
- You think it's serious?
- As serious as it ever is.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.490
Why do you put up with it, Sherri?

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:14.742
I just got to sweat it out.

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:19.205
She'll dump him, and then he'll come
running home to Mommy all lovey-dovey.

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:21.499
- It's always the same story.
- He's such an asshole.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.834
He's such a liar.

01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:28.839
Sometimes I ask him stuff
just to entertain myself.

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:31.801
- What do you mean?
- Just to see what kind of cockamamy lie

01:30:31.885 --> 01:30:33.803
he's gonna come up with next.

01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:36.514
I mean, some of the stories
are really fantastic.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.524
Betty.

01:32:20.619 --> 01:32:22.453
How's the sex?

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.250
Well, he's real quick.

01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:32.379
He's too quick for me.

01:32:32.464 --> 01:32:34.089
Plus, he won't do oral.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.886
- Do you?
- I used to, before we got married.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.306
I would if he would stop
fooling around. I kind of like it.

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:47.436
What about you?

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:51.065
- Ralph's pretty conservative.
- Yeah?

01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:54.068
No!

01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:57.029
How about other than Ralph?

01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:59.782
Oh, we've been married
a long time, Sherri.

01:33:01.368 --> 01:33:03.911
There's never been anybody else
since you've been married?

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.500
No.

01:33:11.044 --> 01:33:13.003
Yeah. Me neither.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.008
Not since the kids.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:21.428
I don't want to! No!

01:33:38.989 --> 01:33:42.283
This atmosphere sure brings it
back to me, son, I'll tell ya.

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:46.537
How many years has it been?
Say, what? Maybe 25 years?

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:49.206
- What?
- Your accident.

01:33:49.291 --> 01:33:51.208
Oh, it's about, uh, 30.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:54.628
I don't know where
all that time went.

01:33:56.298 --> 01:33:58.465
Oh.

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:01.510
Howard. Uh-oh.

01:34:01.594 --> 01:34:05.347
You remember?
I brought it along to show, uh –

01:34:05.432 --> 01:34:07.558
- Casey.
- C-C-Casey. Yeah.

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:09.560
Casey.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.024
Speaking of that,
you know the creek?

01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:18.277
You can't cross it anymore now.
They put a gate up about 10, 11 year –

01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:21.572
- Yeah, 11 years ago. Just before I left.
- Yeah? That's good.

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:24.992
Of course, if they'd had a gate,
that would have...

01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:26.660
changed things, wouldn't it?

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:28.848
I mean, you wouldn't have been
in the hospital that day.

01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:31.832
And I – Hell, you probably
wouldn't be out here.

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:34.520
You might not have even had Casey,
let alone him being in the hospital.

01:34:34.544 --> 01:34:37.254
We could still be back
in Minnesota with me, and married –

01:34:37.339 --> 01:34:38.922
Pop, stop it.

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:04.114
Hi. This is the Finnigan home.

01:35:04.199 --> 01:35:08.744
We can't get to the phone right now,
so leave a message after the beep.

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:13.040
"Oh, somewhere in this favored land

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:15.709
"the sun is shining bright,

01:35:15.794 --> 01:35:18.545
"the band is playing somewhere

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:21.882
"and somewhere hearts are light.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:24.760
"And somewhere men are laughing,

01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:28.597
"and somewhere children shout,

01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:31.975
"but there is no joy in Mudville –

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:35.354
mighty Casey has struck out."

01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:40.234
You still resent my not being
in the hospital with you, don't ya?

01:35:40.318 --> 01:35:42.403
No, I don't.
I don't even remember.

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:43.987
Yeah, you do.

01:35:45.323 --> 01:35:48.700
You know it, uh –
it wasn't my decision.

01:35:48.785 --> 01:35:52.413
Things had gotten so out of hand
between your mother and me by then that I –

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:55.666
Hell, I didn't want to be in your room
and make it worse.

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.668
I don't even remember the hospital.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:00.963
I remember, uh, the car flippin' over

01:36:01.047 --> 01:36:03.590
and gettin' washed away.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:06.176
That's about it.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:11.640
I did something that day
that I'd never done in my life.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:17.521
I didn't tell your mother the truth.

01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:21.191
Called in sick, and then I left
like I was going to work.

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:23.777
And I didn't tell your mother
I was going over to Olla's house

01:36:23.862 --> 01:36:25.779
to hook up a new fridge
and an ice maker.

01:36:25.864 --> 01:36:27.781
She'd have had a fit!

01:36:27.866 --> 01:36:29.844
I mean, even if she knew
that I was getting paid for my time,

01:36:29.868 --> 01:36:31.785
she would have had a fit.

01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:33.954
It was okay for her to help Olla.
Oh, not for me.

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:36.248
See? She was very possessive that way.

01:36:36.332 --> 01:36:38.625
Well, sisters are funny, you know.

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:42.129
Hell, in this case, I was happy to oblige.
I needed the extra money.

01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:44.173
And it was Olla's idea
not to involve your mother.

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:47.426
It was Olla's idea for me to lie.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.431
I figured it would take a couple hours. Then
I'll go to work, tell 'em I'm feeling better.

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:55.058
Anyway, I – I told Olla
I'd be over early, and I was.

01:36:55.143 --> 01:36:57.811
But there was no answer.
So, uh, the – the door was open.

01:36:57.896 --> 01:37:01.064
I go in. I hear that she's up
in the shower. So I holler out.

01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:03.984
You know, so that she won't get scared
when she comes out of the shower

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:06.403
and hears me working
down in the basement, and so forth.

01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:07.905
Anyway, I go down.

01:37:07.989 --> 01:37:11.492
After a while,
Olla comes down to the basement

01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:14.161
in a robe.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:17.164
Huh?

01:37:17.248 --> 01:37:21.251
And she says that
she got cleaned up for me.

01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:25.672
And I think that's very odd to say
under the circumstances.

01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:29.593
But you know Olla.
Anyhow, she says, "How's it going?"

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:32.554
I said, "Fine."
And, uh, after a while she –

01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:34.950
Yeah, she asked me if I wanted a beer.
She says, "You want a beer?"

01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:37.912
I said, "Geez, it's a little early in the
morning for that sort of thing, isn't it?"

01:37:37.936 --> 01:37:41.313
She says, "Well, I'm not your employer,
am I? Do you want one or not?"

01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:44.733
I said, "Oh, well, what the hell. Why not?"
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.402
She comes back with two beers.

01:37:47.487 --> 01:37:50.864
I tell ya, every time I finish a beer –
foom! There's another one in my hand.

01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:53.928
Christ, now we're up in the kitchen, and I'm
havin' trouble makin' the joints connect –

01:37:53.952 --> 01:37:56.078
I – 'Cause I'm on
my fourth or fifth beer.

01:37:56.162 --> 01:37:58.622
And I said, "Olla –"
In fact, this is exactly what I said.

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.624
Oh, I'll never forget this.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:05.295
I said, "Olla, if I have one more beer,
I'm gonna have to take a nap."

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.923
And she says,
"I wondered what it would take

01:38:08.007 --> 01:38:10.759
to get you into bed."

01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:12.135
Hey.

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:15.138
Now, I laughed. You know, I –

01:38:15.223 --> 01:38:19.017
She says, "Don't tell me it didn't cross
your mind, because I'll call you a liar."

01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:21.061
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
It didn't ever!

01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:23.021
Yeah, I found her company attractive.

01:38:23.106 --> 01:38:25.399
But, Jesus, there was no real –

01:38:25.483 --> 01:38:27.651
And I didn't –

01:38:29.445 --> 01:38:33.240
I don't know. I didn't want
to hurt her feelings, you know?

01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:35.826
I mean, after all,
it was your mother's sister.

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:39.663
Anyway, I, uh –
I don't know how much time passed.

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:44.001
All I know is that I am working like hell on that
ice maker trying to get the damn thing going.

01:38:44.085 --> 01:38:46.169
And she is saying things like, uh,

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:50.507
"If the positions were reversed,
my sister would be doing the same thing."

01:38:50.592 --> 01:38:54.177
Do you believe – You know, like this is
some little thing between the two of –

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:57.889
I-I started sweating. I tell you, my knees are
shaking. I don't know what the hell to do.

01:38:57.974 --> 01:39:00.369
- I don't know which way to turn.
- There's no smokin' in here, Pop.

01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:02.311
- Huh?
- No smoking.

01:39:02.395 --> 01:39:04.438
Oh, that's good.
Down to four a day.

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:08.233
And then –

01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:10.235
she opens the robe.

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.279
And I get a load – Oh, Jesus.

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:14.281
God, that woman was put together

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:17.117
a hell of lot better than you'd think
when she was just in a dress.

01:39:17.201 --> 01:39:20.203
I'm tellin' ya.
Jesus, that's hard for any man to resist.

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:23.790
I mean, I don't know about you.
It sure as hell was for me.

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:25.792
Yeah, well, that, uh –

01:39:25.877 --> 01:39:27.961
that's a long time ago, Pop.

01:39:28.046 --> 01:39:30.005
So –

01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:39.973
Neither of us heard your mother come in.

01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:42.017
Oh, God Almighty.

01:39:43.728 --> 01:39:46.146
She was in such a state.
You know, she –

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:48.982
Sh-She – She didn't really look at Olla.
She just –

01:39:49.067 --> 01:39:51.693
She looked at me, and she said,
"Howard's in the hospital."

01:39:51.778 --> 01:39:55.489
And then on – on the way
to the hospital, she said –

01:39:55.573 --> 01:39:59.493
Well, she cried a little bit.
But – But she – she only said,

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:02.496
"Why didn't you tell me
that you weren't going to work?

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.498
They told me you were sick."

01:40:04.582 --> 01:40:07.084
Oh, Christ, I was so ashamed. I just –

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:11.004
It was –
It was an unlucky day, you know?

01:40:11.089 --> 01:40:13.006
Bad timing.

01:40:13.091 --> 01:40:15.175
But I tell you, that first
day in the hospital

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:19.221
your mother and I stood side by side
while those doctors reported to us.

01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:22.974
And most of the news was bad.
But still, we stood there together.

01:40:23.059 --> 01:40:24.601
We took it together!

01:40:25.645 --> 01:40:27.771
And then Olla lied.

01:40:29.816 --> 01:40:33.360
God! Olla told your mother that – that...

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:35.362
we'd been having affairs in the past.

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:37.531
It was only that one time. I tr –

01:40:37.615 --> 01:40:41.451
Oh, I tried to explain to your mother
exactly how it happened.

01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:45.789
You know what your mother said...

01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:48.625
to me?

01:40:49.711 --> 01:40:52.295
"I don't want you around anymore.

01:40:54.549 --> 01:40:57.634
"I'll get through this thing alone better.

01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:01.722
No matter what happens to Howard."

01:41:02.849 --> 01:41:04.766
I had to respect her wishes, Howard.

01:41:04.851 --> 01:41:07.728
I mean, whether I wanted to or not.
I had to.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.941
Christ, I kept thinking, you know,
someday – some – some – some –

01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:16.403
The truth will come out, you know,
and she'll understand.

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:23.285
We both know that never happened, so –

01:41:25.371 --> 01:41:28.790
Mr. Finnigan? Excuse me, Mr. Finnigan.
Uh, you have a telephone call.

01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:32.169
It's Mrs. Finnigan.
Oh, you can use that phone right there.

01:41:35.548 --> 01:41:37.841
Yeah, hi. Everything's okay here.
You all right?

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:41.303
Um, I'm coming back to the hospital.
Do you want me to bring you anything?

01:41:41.387 --> 01:41:44.389
Why? You should get
a good night's sleep.

01:41:44.474 --> 01:41:46.975
- Casey's gonna be all right.
- I'm not staying here.

01:41:47.059 --> 01:41:49.311
That crazy person keeps calling.
I'm scared to death.

01:41:49.395 --> 01:41:51.980
Well, don't, uh –
don't answer the phone, honey.

01:41:52.064 --> 01:41:54.941
Maybe it's the –
the driver from the car.

01:41:55.026 --> 01:41:57.986
Maybe she's, uh,
feeling guilty or something.

01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:00.280
It's a man.

01:42:00.364 --> 01:42:02.616
Well, don't worry.

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.618
I mean, I'm here with Casey.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:07.788
The doctors and the nurses
are there with him all the time.

01:42:07.872 --> 01:42:10.624
- He's gonna be all right.
- No, I'm comin'.

01:42:10.708 --> 01:42:15.462
No – I wish you wouldn't. Honey?

01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:22.302
Uh, you finish your coffee.
I gotta get back.

01:42:46.202 --> 01:42:48.286
Hi. This is the Finnigan home.

01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:53.750
We can't get to the phone right now,
so leave a message after the beep.

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:11.351
- That is a good painting.
- Yeah.

01:43:11.435 --> 01:43:12.978
Really good.

01:43:15.106 --> 01:43:16.273
- Colors are good.
- Yeah.

01:43:16.357 --> 01:43:18.650
- Goes with the walls.
- But look at these fish though.

01:43:18.734 --> 01:43:20.944
- Aren't those cool?
- Mmm.

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:24.072
- Aren't those cool?
- Yeah, I don't really give a fuck about fish.

01:43:24.156 --> 01:43:26.449
They just kinda swim and shit.

01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:29.995
- Hey, your makeup looks good.
- Yeah?

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:33.456
- You think it's too much though?
- No. You're like a model.

01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:35.458
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:43:35.543 --> 01:43:36.543
- Hey.
- Almost ready.

01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:38.587
- Did Bill do it?
- Yeah. Of course he did.

01:43:38.671 --> 01:43:41.548
- Bill, you've gotta do me sometime.
- Yeah, sure.

01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:43.592
Hey, make mine well-done.

01:43:45.344 --> 01:43:47.304
Hey.

01:43:47.388 --> 01:43:49.389
Look at that.

01:43:50.558 --> 01:43:52.225
- Look at that.
- Looks pretty.

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:54.728
So, what were you saying
about, um, the virt –

01:43:54.812 --> 01:43:56.730
- What is it? The virtual –
- Virtual reality.

01:43:56.814 --> 01:43:59.733
- Yeah.
- Okay, you know what "virtual" means?

01:43:59.817 --> 01:44:01.401
Uh, sort of.

01:44:01.485 --> 01:44:04.654
Okay, it's like really real.

01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:06.781
So, virtual reality

01:44:06.866 --> 01:44:10.744
is practically, totally real.

01:44:10.828 --> 01:44:12.329
- But not.
- Mm-hmm.

01:44:13.289 --> 01:44:14.915
- Claire.
- Standby.

01:44:15.666 --> 01:44:17.083
At my command...

01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:21.087
- Claire?
- Get back here!

01:44:24.425 --> 01:44:26.426
♪♪

01:44:28.846 --> 01:44:30.764
Goddamn it!

01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:32.766
Listen!

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.191
Stuart.

01:44:42.777 --> 01:44:44.861
I thought you weren't
coming home till tomorrow.

01:44:44.946 --> 01:44:47.697
- Well, you know.
- Oh.

01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:50.784
God, I hate that fish smell.

01:44:50.868 --> 01:44:54.371
They said on the TV
that there was rain up there.

01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:58.583
- Did you get rained out?
- No. Caught our limit.

01:44:58.668 --> 01:45:00.627
- Oh.
- Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:02.629
And I missed you.

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:05.632
That'll be the day.

01:45:05.716 --> 01:45:08.259
- Your hands stink.
- Mmm.

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:11.638
- Phew.
- Kind of smells like pussy, don't you think?

01:45:11.722 --> 01:45:15.725
I hate that. Go wash your hands.

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:19.646
- Stop it!
- Smells like a rainbow to me.

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.065
- Go wash your hands.
- Come on. Come on, come on.

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:24.275
What are you doing?

01:45:25.569 --> 01:45:28.405
Come on. I've been sleeping
with men for three days.

01:45:56.726 --> 01:45:58.893
Bunny, my ass.

01:46:20.124 --> 01:46:22.917
- I'm glad you came home early.
- Oh, me too.

01:46:23.002 --> 01:46:26.546
Mmm.

01:46:29.425 --> 01:46:31.342
- Oh.
- Ooh, you're all wet.

01:46:31.427 --> 01:46:33.762
Yeah. You'll have to dry me off.

01:46:40.978 --> 01:46:44.147
Did I ever tell you about what happened
in the last Pomona game in '83?

01:46:45.316 --> 01:46:49.152
- You remember that game?
- Yeah, I broke my – broke my ankle.

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:53.907
Right, okay, well, while you were
snapping your ankle,

01:46:53.991 --> 01:46:56.701
me and Red,

01:46:56.786 --> 01:46:59.204
we slipped Mickeys
on these four girls.

01:46:59.288 --> 01:47:02.457
This is true. These,
like, bootleg quaaludes.

01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:04.959
Like – Like dangerous stuff, right?

01:47:05.044 --> 01:47:08.421
And I remember 'cause two of the
girls' names was Kelly. Remember?

01:47:08.506 --> 01:47:10.924
I think you might have met
those two Kellys before.

01:47:13.803 --> 01:47:15.970
He doesn't call you, does he?

01:47:16.055 --> 01:47:19.516
- What do you mean?
- You know, when you're workin'.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:23.144
Oh. I don't think so.

01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:26.022
I mean, I get a lot of Bills,

01:47:26.107 --> 01:47:28.566
but it's – it's a common name.

01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:30.860
'Cause you'd recognize his voice, right?

01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:32.862
Oh, yeah.

01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:35.990
Oh, it was so weird.

01:47:36.075 --> 01:47:39.119
The bishop in my parents' church called me.

01:47:39.203 --> 01:47:42.122
Oh, and he wanted, um, an incest call

01:47:42.206 --> 01:47:44.666
with, like, a four-year-old girl.

01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:48.461
I mean, I look at, you know,
Joe-Joe or Josette.

01:47:48.546 --> 01:47:50.797
Man, that is fucked up.

01:47:50.881 --> 01:47:52.882
Oh, man.

01:47:52.967 --> 01:47:55.677
Oh, that could just fuck your life up.

01:47:55.761 --> 01:47:57.679
I mean, a little eight-year-old girl,

01:47:57.763 --> 01:48:00.056
she just does whatever
the adult tells her to do.

01:48:00.808 --> 01:48:03.059
Oh, man. I – I know.

01:48:03.144 --> 01:48:05.270
Believe me, that's fucked.

01:48:05.354 --> 01:48:07.689
Okay, look, I – I-I don't condone it.

01:48:07.773 --> 01:48:10.441
But it's a money call.

01:48:10.526 --> 01:48:14.320
And keeps him off the streets anyway.

01:48:14.405 --> 01:48:15.822
♪♪ -I like this music.

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:17.365
Yeah. This is good, huh?

01:48:17.449 --> 01:48:19.909
It's not – I don't know. It's different.
It's kind of dry.

01:48:19.994 --> 01:48:26.457
It's like dry humping
some wet pussy flap.

01:48:29.044 --> 01:48:30.378
Wet pussy.

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:33.506
I know what that's all about.

01:48:46.228 --> 01:48:48.605
You make me very happy.

01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:54.277
- Claire.
- Hmm?

01:48:55.779 --> 01:48:58.656
We found a body up there.

01:48:58.741 --> 01:49:00.283
A girl.

01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:03.536
Guess she was murdered.

01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:08.875
Stuart.

01:49:09.877 --> 01:49:12.128
Well, when we got there, she was –

01:49:12.213 --> 01:49:15.882
This, uh, naked body in the water,

01:49:15.966 --> 01:49:17.884
just floatin' there.

01:49:18.969 --> 01:49:20.470
Dead.

01:49:23.098 --> 01:49:25.016
Jesus.

01:49:27.144 --> 01:49:29.687
When? Were you fishing?

01:49:29.772 --> 01:49:31.898
Nah. No, we – we just got up there.

01:49:31.982 --> 01:49:34.400
We're setting up camp, and –

01:49:34.485 --> 01:49:37.070
Well, Vern saw it in the water.

01:49:38.364 --> 01:49:40.740
It was really somethin'.

01:49:41.909 --> 01:49:44.160
I never experienced
anything like it before.

01:49:45.287 --> 01:49:47.205
Hell, no one knew what to do.

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:50.750
What did you do?

01:49:51.961 --> 01:49:55.046
Well, you know,
there wasn't much we could do.

01:49:55.130 --> 01:49:57.298
It was – It was gettin' dark

01:49:57.383 --> 01:50:00.718
and, uh, she was dead.

01:50:02.179 --> 01:50:04.347
Nothin' was gonna change that.

01:50:05.683 --> 01:50:08.351
- How old was she?
- Huh?

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.937
How old was she?

01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:13.439
Uh – Oh, I don't know.

01:50:13.524 --> 01:50:16.526
In her 20s, maybe.
You couldn't tell.

01:50:20.656 --> 01:50:22.573
Must have been horrible.

01:50:24.827 --> 01:50:26.744
What did you do?

01:50:26.829 --> 01:50:28.746
Nothin'.

01:50:29.999 --> 01:50:31.916
Nothing?

01:50:33.252 --> 01:50:36.546
I mean, after you
got her out of the water.

01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:39.632
- Did she drown?
- We don't know.

01:50:39.717 --> 01:50:42.176
I didn't think we should
move her, you know?

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:45.013
You left her in the water?

01:50:45.097 --> 01:50:46.973
Yeah.

01:50:56.525 --> 01:50:58.067
For how long?

01:50:58.152 --> 01:51:00.653
Until we left and reported it.

01:51:00.738 --> 01:51:02.905
I tied her to the bank.

01:51:24.094 --> 01:51:26.804
How long did you say
you left her in the water?

01:51:26.889 --> 01:51:28.431
Claire.

01:51:29.683 --> 01:51:31.768
She was dead.

01:51:31.852 --> 01:51:34.687
We didn't think we should move her.
It was dark.

01:51:34.772 --> 01:51:37.690
We made a decision to leave her there
until we could report it!

01:51:38.442 --> 01:51:40.109
She was already dead!

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.029
And when did you report it?

01:51:43.113 --> 01:51:44.864
This morning. Today.

01:51:45.908 --> 01:51:48.242
- Today?
- Yeah.

01:51:51.163 --> 01:51:52.872
And when did you find her?

01:51:52.956 --> 01:51:54.874
I told you.

01:51:56.293 --> 01:51:58.378
Well, when did you catch the fish?

01:51:58.462 --> 01:52:00.380
Christ!

01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:03.216
That's what we went up there for –

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.926
to fish.

01:52:05.010 --> 01:52:09.222
You fished while she was in the water?
You just left her there?

01:52:09.306 --> 01:52:10.807
Claire –

01:52:11.767 --> 01:52:13.393
You're making me sick!

01:52:14.395 --> 01:52:17.563
Marian's got a crush on Alex Trebek.

01:52:17.648 --> 01:52:20.400
- Alex Trebek?
- Yeah.

01:52:20.484 --> 01:52:23.152
- Where'd she meet him?
- At a party.

01:52:24.405 --> 01:52:28.074
He's an art collector or something. She
thinks he might buy one of her paintings.

01:52:32.621 --> 01:52:34.705
- Nah, I don't think so.
- No?

01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:37.667
I don't see how she could even
give those things away.

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:40.002
Well, she sells a lot more
than you think.

01:52:45.008 --> 01:52:47.593
I posed for her today.

01:52:47.678 --> 01:52:50.346
- Ralph walked in the middle of it.
- Ralph. What a jerk.

01:52:50.431 --> 01:52:52.723
I don't know if I know a bigger jerk.

01:52:52.808 --> 01:52:54.851
It was embarrassing,
but I guess they're used to it,

01:52:54.935 --> 01:52:56.853
being doctors and artists and all.

01:52:56.937 --> 01:52:59.272
What was embarrassing about it?

01:52:59.356 --> 01:53:00.982
Well, you know.

01:53:02.067 --> 01:53:03.651
I was nude.

01:53:11.201 --> 01:53:13.411
You mean, like, you were naked?

01:53:13.495 --> 01:53:16.164
Mm-hmm. "Nude," they call it.

01:53:17.875 --> 01:53:19.500
You mean...

01:53:20.544 --> 01:53:22.545

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:24.130
Naked?

01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:40.563

Chick loved it there.
Everyone does.

02:02:26.923 --> 02:02:29.842
They really know how to treat
a jazz person there.

02:02:32.137 --> 02:02:36.181
How was your night?
How'd your hand do?

02:02:36.266 --> 02:02:40.853
I remember, Chick damn near
cut his finger off once.

02:02:42.272 --> 02:02:44.523
It was in Kansas City.

02:02:44.607 --> 02:02:48.861
And he was working
with Anita O'Day, and, uh – I forget.

02:02:48.945 --> 02:02:51.822
And he punched the window
of a car out

02:02:51.906 --> 02:02:54.033
'cause he'd left the keys inside.

02:02:55.952 --> 02:02:58.078
That was really a hard time
for him to play

02:02:58.163 --> 02:03:02.332
because the cut
was on his slide hand.

02:03:02.417 --> 02:03:05.669
It kept openin' up.
And I knew it hurt him.

02:03:07.714 --> 02:03:11.050
And when I saw that guy
walk in that club –

02:03:11.134 --> 02:03:14.136
I knew it wasn't
gonna hurt much longer.

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:17.639
He walked straight to Chick.

02:03:18.850 --> 02:03:22.061
Chick bent down,

02:03:22.145 --> 02:03:25.230
looked up at me and smiled.

02:03:25.315 --> 02:03:29.485
He said, "Five minutes. Five minutes."

02:03:31.362 --> 02:03:33.322
Well, I'd heard that before.

02:03:34.741 --> 02:03:36.992
Five hours later I got a phone call.

02:03:38.578 --> 02:03:42.456
Could I please come
and get my old man 'cause...

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:45.709

want him in the house.

concert people tonight?

- Yeah, them.

02:05:35.403 --> 02:05:37.529
- Yes, we are.
- Claire, about last night –

02:05:37.614 --> 02:05:39.907
- Uh –
- Read the paper.

02:05:41.576 --> 02:05:44.411
Does it say something about it?

02:05:44.495 --> 02:05:46.872
It had a name –

02:05:46.956 --> 02:05:49.333
Caroline Avery.

02:05:49.417 --> 02:05:51.752
She was 23 years old.

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:56.381
She'd been raped
and then smothered to death.

02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:00.010
She was from Bakersfield.

02:06:17.695 --> 02:06:19.655
Thank you.

02:06:20.698 --> 02:06:23.617
Hey, baby.
Could I, uh, get a –

02:06:30.208 --> 02:06:32.459

Earl, what are you doing here?

02:06:42.178 --> 02:06:45.097
I'm here to see you.
What else?

02:06:49.018 --> 02:06:50.936
Baby, I've looked everywhere for you.

02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:53.188
I was at the trailer last night.
You weren't there.

02:06:53.273 --> 02:06:56.108
Your car was there,
but you weren't there.

02:06:56.192 --> 02:06:59.194
Honey, where you been sleeping?
Look at your hair.

02:07:00.697 --> 02:07:03.532
I – I slept outside.

02:07:05.034 --> 02:07:07.703
I didn't wanna sleep in our bed.

02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.208
People are looking.
You wanna order something?

02:07:13.293 --> 02:07:16.712
Yeah. How about you on a bed of rice?

02:07:17.797 --> 02:07:19.715
Cut it out.

02:07:21.801 --> 02:07:25.554
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yeah. Give me some coffee.

02:07:26.639 --> 02:07:30.017
- How about an egg sandwich?
- With a broke yolk?

02:07:30.101 --> 02:07:32.060
Yeah, with a broke yolk.

02:07:38.067 --> 02:07:40.861
Thanks, baby.
How did you get here?

02:07:40.945 --> 02:07:43.488
Peg brought me. I didn't wanna
use the car after what happened.

02:07:43.573 --> 02:07:45.490
Yeah, right.

02:07:45.575 --> 02:07:48.076
What time you gettin' off?

02:07:50.705 --> 02:07:54.416
- About an hour.
- What do you say I chauffeur you around

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:58.211
to the manner in which you are soon
to become accustomed?

02:07:59.756 --> 02:08:02.924
- I'm sure.
- I'm getting us out of here, baby.

02:08:04.093 --> 02:08:06.386
I'm getting us out of Downey.

02:08:06.471 --> 02:08:08.847
Till the wheels come off, baby.

02:08:09.932 --> 02:08:11.933
Till the wheels come off.

02:08:19.275 --> 02:08:22.277
Is that a fine-lookin' woman or what?

02:08:22.362 --> 02:08:23.945
I beg your pardon?

02:08:25.114 --> 02:08:28.116
How'd you like to be married
to something like that?

02:08:29.369 --> 02:08:31.286
I am.

02:08:33.831 --> 02:08:36.083
Shh, shh, shh.

02:08:50.515 --> 02:08:52.140

02:08:53.726 --> 02:08:56.019
Shit!

02:08:57.814 --> 02:09:00.607
Ah, silly Daddy, sleeping on Mommy.

02:09:00.691 --> 02:09:04.694
Daddy, Austin's crying and he woke me up.

02:09:04.779 --> 02:09:07.697
- What is it?
- He misses Suzy.

02:09:07.782 --> 02:09:11.743
Well, you go tell Austin
to come in here, and Will too.

02:09:11.828 --> 02:09:14.496
- I got some good news, a surprise.
- About Suzy?

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:17.249
Maybe. You go and get them
and bring 'em back here.

02:09:17.333 --> 02:09:19.251
Will, Austin.

02:09:19.335 --> 02:09:21.711
Wake up, wake up.

02:09:31.806 --> 02:09:34.015
Okay.

02:09:40.106 --> 02:09:42.941
Come here. It's okay.
It's gonna be all right. Listen.

02:09:43.025 --> 02:09:44.943
- Kids, can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

02:09:45.027 --> 02:09:47.571
Okay, Daddy did something last night
he shouldn't have done.

02:09:47.655 --> 02:09:49.573
That's why you have to keep it a secret.

02:09:49.657 --> 02:09:52.492
Daddy went down to the police station
and put an APB out on Suzy.

02:09:52.577 --> 02:09:53.952
An APB?

02:09:54.036 --> 02:09:56.872
You're not supposed to put APB's
out on dogs, but I did it.

02:09:56.956 --> 02:09:59.291
And I got a call this morning.

02:09:59.375 --> 02:10:01.668
I think they think they know
where Suzy is.

02:10:01.752 --> 02:10:04.546
- Really?
- Yes, and as soon as I have my coffee

02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:06.798
I'm gonna go down
and see if I can find her, okay?

02:10:06.883 --> 02:10:08.902
- Now you guys go and get dressed.
- I wanna go with you.

02:10:08.926 --> 02:10:11.845
No. You go get dressed, and we'll see
if we can't find our little doggy.

02:10:11.929 --> 02:10:14.598
Put your clothes on, Will.
Do what your dad says.

02:10:20.271 --> 02:10:23.064
Gene, not now.
The kids will –

02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:25.358
Oh.

02:10:26.861 --> 02:10:30.447
There's a line of prose
from the writings of St. Teresa

02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:34.534
which seemed more and more
appropriate as I thought toward this.

02:10:34.619 --> 02:10:37.329
So I want to offer a meditation
on the sentence.

02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:43.710
St. Teresa, that extraordinary woman
who lived 373 years ago,

02:10:43.794 --> 02:10:47.631
said, "Words lead to deeds.

02:10:47.715 --> 02:10:50.842
"They prepare the soul, make it ready

02:10:50.927 --> 02:10:53.261
and move it to tenderness."

02:10:53.346 --> 02:10:58.058
There's a clarity and beauty in that
thought expressed in just this way.

02:10:58.142 --> 02:11:01.228
There's also something
a little foreign in the sentiment

02:11:01.312 --> 02:11:03.271
coming to our attention
in these times –

02:11:10.488 --> 02:11:13.949
How are you today, sir?
My name is Aubrey Bell.

02:11:14.951 --> 02:11:16.868
- You must be Mr. Weathers.
- Yeah.

02:11:16.953 --> 02:11:19.097
I have something here for Mrs. Weathers.
She won something.

02:11:19.121 --> 02:11:21.957
- Is Mrs. Weathers home?
- Oh, she's not at home.

02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:24.751
- What did she win?
- I'll have to show you. May I come in?

02:11:24.835 --> 02:11:27.462
I'm kind of busy right now.
Tell me what it is.

02:11:27.547 --> 02:11:31.800
She won a free vacuuming
and carpet shampoo, no strings attached.

02:11:31.884 --> 02:11:33.426
I'll even do your mattress.

02:11:33.511 --> 02:11:38.682
You'd be surprised what could build up under
a mattress over the months, over the years.

02:11:38.766 --> 02:11:40.976
- Same with the pillows.
- Really?

02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:42.978
Yes, sir. This is your lucky day.

02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:59.369
Well, I can see you've had
some kind of problem here.

02:11:59.453 --> 02:12:01.788
That doesn't affect my work any.

02:12:01.872 --> 02:12:04.165
I've seen about everything
there is to see.

02:12:30.067 --> 02:12:33.486
- So, what do you want to do today?
- Maybe go to the beach.

02:12:33.571 --> 02:12:36.448
No way. Who's gonna drive us?

02:12:36.532 --> 02:12:40.619
- I don't know. Let's go look at the cop.
- Yeah, come on.

02:12:40.703 --> 02:12:43.830
- Cops freak me out.
- He's looking at us.

02:12:43.914 --> 02:12:45.957
- Oh, what is that cop doing?
- Hello, boys.

02:12:46.042 --> 02:12:48.877
- Hi. What's the problem?
- No problem.

02:12:48.961 --> 02:12:54.090
- I'm gonna have to take that dog, though.
- What – Take? Take? Dad! Dad!

02:12:54.175 --> 02:12:56.134
- Yeah? What's the matter?
- He's taking my dog.

02:12:56.218 --> 02:12:59.679
Hey, hey. Excuse me.
Officer, what's going on here anyway?

02:13:00.723 --> 02:13:04.267
- How long have you had this dog, sir?
- What difference does it make? It's my kid's dog.

02:13:04.352 --> 02:13:07.205
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take this dog,
sir. It's been missing for a couple of days.

02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:10.125
- It's highly dangerous. It bit an infant.
- A police officer's taking the dog.

02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:12.067
We have to check it for rabies.

02:13:12.151 --> 02:13:14.129
It doesn't look sick to me.
You sure you got the right dog?

02:13:14.153 --> 02:13:16.821
- Fits the description, sir.
- Please, sir. Don't take my dog.

02:13:16.906 --> 02:13:19.908
I'm sorry, son. I have to.
It's for your own safety.

02:13:19.992 --> 02:13:23.745
And kids, in the future,
if you find a lost dog, report it.

02:13:23.829 --> 02:13:26.498
Every animal has their rightful owner.

02:13:26.582 --> 02:13:29.417
-Don't let him take my dog.
-Don't worry about it.
-In you go, Suzy.

02:13:29.502 --> 02:13:33.171
Don't you have anything better to do
than take dogs away from kids?

02:13:33.255 --> 02:13:37.050
Keep up with that lip, sir, I'm gonna
have to cite you for an open container.

02:13:37.134 --> 02:13:40.136
Dad, aren't you gonna do something?

02:13:40.221 --> 02:13:42.541
- Aren't you gonna get him back?
- We'll get you a new dog.

02:13:42.598 --> 02:13:44.518
- But I don't want a new dog.
- Let's get inside.

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:46.601
- Frisbee was special.
- Don't worry about it.

02:14:27.685 --> 02:14:30.353
I've asked one of my colleagues
to come by.

02:14:30.438 --> 02:14:33.064
We're not sure why
Casey's not responsive.

02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:35.567
His CAT scan shows
the blood clot's still small,

02:14:35.651 --> 02:14:37.944
but there's still more brain swelling.

02:14:38.028 --> 02:14:41.531
I'd like to suggest some minor surgery.
Intracranial pressure monitor.

02:14:41.615 --> 02:14:44.075
- Oh, God.
- There's no cause for alarm.

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:46.080
Casey's making
small improvements in other areas.

02:14:46.162 --> 02:14:48.913
His lungs have cleared up substantially.
That's a big plus.

02:14:48.998 --> 02:14:51.166
Brian, the Negro boy in 111.

02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:54.878
I think he was operated on yesterday.
Could I inquire about his condition?

02:14:54.962 --> 02:14:56.880
- Oh, yeah. He's doing very well.
- Yeah?

02:14:56.964 --> 02:15:00.759
He's out of critical condition.
We'll be taking him out of the ICU today.

02:15:00.843 --> 02:15:02.469
Oh, that's nice. Thanks.

02:15:02.553 --> 02:15:04.512
Excuse me just one minute.

02:15:05.973 --> 02:15:10.769
- Excuse me. What exactly is a diuretic?
- It makes him urinate more.

02:15:10.853 --> 02:15:15.523
- I see. So, that's to alleviate pressure?
- Casey. Casey, please wake up.

02:15:15.608 --> 02:15:17.525
- Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.
- Dr. Wyman.

02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:21.279
I wanted to thank you for saving my
son's life. You are a miracle worker.

02:15:21.363 --> 02:15:23.281
- That's my job.
- He'll have a minor surgery?

02:15:23.365 --> 02:15:26.367
Nurse, are you clear about this?
Mr. Finnigan, I'm sorry, I –

02:15:26.452 --> 02:15:28.828
Hey, Knute.
I just was hearing the good news.

02:15:28.913 --> 02:15:31.414
Congratulations.
I can't tell you how pleased I am.

02:15:31.499 --> 02:15:35.043
Thank you very much.
I mean, everybody has been so nice.

02:15:35.127 --> 02:15:37.045
Casey.

02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:40.215
Casey, we love you, honey.
Please wake up.

02:15:40.299 --> 02:15:44.260
Any change in my grandson
that you know of? I mean –

02:15:44.345 --> 02:15:46.345
I'm sorry. I don't have
any additional information.

02:15:46.388 --> 02:15:51.142
Casey. Casey?

02:15:51.227 --> 02:15:53.394
Hey, sweetie.

02:15:53.479 --> 02:15:55.647
Hey, sweetie.

02:15:55.731 --> 02:15:58.191
Casey. Howard!

02:15:58.275 --> 02:16:00.253
- How's your little boy?
- Howard, Casey's waking up.

02:16:00.277 --> 02:16:02.070
Look, his eyes are open.

02:16:03.447 --> 02:16:05.365
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Case.

02:16:05.449 --> 02:16:09.327
Hey, Case. Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

02:16:09.411 --> 02:16:11.538
Hey, can you hear me?

02:16:11.622 --> 02:16:13.540
Hi, son.

02:16:13.624 --> 02:16:17.001
- Hey, Casey.
- Case.

02:16:17.086 --> 02:16:19.921
Casey. Hey, Case, can you hear –

02:16:20.005 --> 02:16:23.049
Howard. Howard, what's that?
Howard, what's happening?

02:16:23.133 --> 02:16:26.594
Ca – Nurse! Nurse! Come here!

02:16:26.679 --> 02:16:28.847
- Howard, do something!
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

02:16:28.931 --> 02:16:31.576
- Come here. I don't think he's breathing here.
- Casey, are you all right?

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:33.520
He opened his eyes
and then he stopped breathing.

02:16:33.602 --> 02:16:36.020
Call a code blue and get me
some help in here immediately.

02:16:36.105 --> 02:16:38.439
- Code blue. ICU.
- Can you hear me, son? Casey?

02:16:38.523 --> 02:16:42.527
I need you to clear the room. I need to make
some space. Let the doctors work. Please.

02:16:42.611 --> 02:16:46.364
- We have to go clear the room.
- No!

02:16:46.448 --> 02:16:48.532
Come on. We'll wait outside.
We'll be right outside.

02:16:48.617 --> 02:16:50.701
Just give them room.
Just give them room to work.

02:16:50.786 --> 02:16:54.163
- Just give them room to work.
- Get the bed and pull it out for me.

02:16:55.499 --> 02:16:57.644
Mrs. Finnigan, I'm sure you'd be
more comfortable. You don't wanna –

02:16:57.668 --> 02:16:59.419
Get out of here!

02:17:03.465 --> 02:17:05.383
Let's put him up on this.

02:17:08.178 --> 02:17:11.931
- Oh!
- Can we get the thallium?

02:17:12.016 --> 02:17:15.393
Nothing. No.
.4 of epinephrine, please.

02:17:15.477 --> 02:17:19.105
- After that, you can draw up .4 of atropine.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

02:17:19.189 --> 02:17:21.148
Start CPR.

02:17:22.317 --> 02:17:24.652
Okay, atropine ready.

02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:27.739
How long we been doing this?

02:17:27.823 --> 02:17:29.781
- Uh, two minutes.
- Good.

02:17:32.536 --> 02:17:34.579
Check for pulse.

02:17:48.218 --> 02:17:50.969
How long?

02:17:51.055 --> 02:17:53.056
I'll continue CPR.

02:18:25.254 --> 02:18:27.382
I can't believe it. Can you?

02:18:28.384 --> 02:18:31.678
She was just over at my apartment
two weeks ago.

02:18:31.762 --> 02:18:33.721
Do you know her from work?

02:18:36.433 --> 02:18:39.936
- Did you sign the guest book?
- No. No, not yet.

02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:41.938
Excuse me.

02:19:12.761 --> 02:19:15.888
- Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.
- Let's go, Zoe. Zoe.

02:19:17.474 --> 02:19:19.475
Mrs. Finnigan.

02:19:20.811 --> 02:19:22.812
How's Casey?

02:19:37.952 --> 02:19:40.538
Casey didn't make it, Zoe.

02:19:40.621 --> 02:19:43.958
Come on, honey.
Come on. Let's go.

02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:06.355
Well, I filled out
an application about two weeks ago.

02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:09.067
A Mr. Walsh told me
to call him in case I hadn't heard.

02:20:09.151 --> 02:20:11.277
Well, I've been away on family business.

02:20:11.361 --> 02:20:14.030
- Please hold a minute.
- Okay. All right. I'll hold.

02:20:14.114 --> 02:20:16.032
Where you been all day?

02:20:17.534 --> 02:20:21.287
- What time is it?
- I asked you where you been.

02:20:21.371 --> 02:20:24.707
Sir, give me your number,
and I'll have Mr. Walsh get back to you.

02:20:24.792 --> 02:20:27.251
Yeah, well, it's 504-0361.

02:20:27.336 --> 02:20:30.254
- But it should be on the application.
- Okay, I'll tell him you called.

02:20:30.339 --> 02:20:32.340
Okay, thank you.

02:20:41.475 --> 02:20:45.353
So this is what it's gonna be, huh?

02:20:46.355 --> 02:20:48.773
Oh, yeah.

02:20:48.857 --> 02:20:52.527
We have to be there at 7:00, you know.
You don't have very much time.

02:20:52.611 --> 02:20:55.113
- What's the big deal? It's just a barbecue.
- Personnel.

02:20:55.197 --> 02:20:58.449
- This is Stuart Kane. With a "K."
- You made the date, Stuart.

02:20:58.534 --> 02:21:01.494
Aren't you the big sportsman
who's supposed to be bringing the fish?

02:21:02.621 --> 02:21:04.497
Why are they always naked?

02:21:05.499 --> 02:21:08.084
Why does naked make it art?

02:21:09.044 --> 02:21:12.380
- Did you make me a drink?
- It's in the blender.

02:21:20.514 --> 02:21:22.807
It smells strong.

02:21:22.891 --> 02:21:24.809
I'm gonna have some wine.

02:21:24.893 --> 02:21:28.062
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.

02:21:28.147 --> 02:21:30.064
I thought we were cooking out.

02:21:30.149 --> 02:21:32.984
Stuart's bringing fish, remember?

02:21:33.068 --> 02:21:35.528
Well, if it's just a barbecue,
why are you getting dressed up?

02:21:35.612 --> 02:21:38.823
- This isn't dressed up.
- I'm not changing.

02:21:38.907 --> 02:21:40.950
She'll probably dress up.

02:21:41.952 --> 02:21:45.288
- Are you competing?
- Competing with who?

02:21:45.372 --> 02:21:47.707
Claire, honey.
We're talking about Claire.

02:21:47.791 --> 02:21:50.293
- Are you competing with Claire?
- For what?

02:21:50.377 --> 02:21:52.670
What women compete for, I guess.

02:21:52.754 --> 02:21:55.089
- Do you think he's attractive?
- Who?

02:21:55.174 --> 02:21:58.009
- The husband.
- Stuart is.

02:21:58.093 --> 02:22:00.678
He's the kind of guy
women find attractive, isn't he?

02:22:00.762 --> 02:22:04.265
- The outdoorsman type.
- We don't know a lot about them.

02:22:04.349 --> 02:22:07.685
I hope they like something
other than chamber music.

02:22:07.769 --> 02:22:10.855
Isn't it wonderful, Marian,
how we can skate around an issue,

02:22:10.939 --> 02:22:13.107
always playing our little game?

02:22:13.192 --> 02:22:15.526
That's a good idea, a game.

02:22:15.611 --> 02:22:19.530
Might help break the ice.
Jeopardy, maybe.

02:22:19.615 --> 02:22:22.617
I'm talking about us.
I'm talking about now.

02:22:23.827 --> 02:22:27.246
- What about us?
- You know.

02:22:27.331 --> 02:22:28.831
Know what?

02:22:30.792 --> 02:22:32.627
Let's forget it.

02:22:33.629 --> 02:22:36.631
Forget what?
What are you talking about?

02:22:36.715 --> 02:22:39.300
- It's nothing. It's ancient history.
- No.

02:22:40.344 --> 02:22:42.303
Something's on your mind.

02:22:43.305 --> 02:22:47.892
- That party.
- What party?

02:22:47.976 --> 02:22:50.705
You know what party I'm talking about,
Marian. The one with Mitchell Anderson.

02:22:50.729 --> 02:22:53.689
Jesus, Ralph.
That was three years ago.

02:22:53.774 --> 02:22:55.399
- You kissed him, didn't you?
- No.

02:22:55.484 --> 02:22:59.654
- Your lipstick was smeared when you came back.
- How would you know? You were drunk!

02:22:59.738 --> 02:23:03.074
Jesus Christ, look at this.
Goddamn it! Look at this!

02:23:03.158 --> 02:23:06.661
Look what you made me do!
Goddamn it! I wanted to wear this.

02:23:09.665 --> 02:23:13.751
That's the way you looked that night with
Mitchell Anderson when you were out necking.

02:23:13.835 --> 02:23:15.753
- He kissed you, didn't he?
- Come on, Ralph.

02:23:15.837 --> 02:23:18.422
I thought we were through with that.

02:23:18.507 --> 02:23:20.947
I want you to tell me about
that night with Mitchell Anderson.

02:23:21.009 --> 02:23:22.927
- There's nothing to tell.
- All right.

02:23:23.011 --> 02:23:26.973
Then tell me about nothingness. I'd like
to hear a complete account of nothing.

02:23:27.057 --> 02:23:29.058
What you didn't do
for two and a half hours.

02:23:29.142 --> 02:23:32.436
Why, Ralph? What's so important?
It was three years ago.

02:23:32.521 --> 02:23:35.147
All right, it's not important.
It's water under the bridge.

02:23:35.232 --> 02:23:38.276
But what irritates me, Marian –
if that's the right word for it –

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:40.444
is that you won't tell me the truth.

02:23:40.529 --> 02:23:44.031
You can't say the obvious.
You can't admit that you lied!

02:23:44.116 --> 02:23:47.285
That's what I don't like, Marian,
having to play this charade.

02:23:47.369 --> 02:23:49.787
God, Ralph.
How did this start?

02:23:49.871 --> 02:23:52.999
Do you know how this started?
'Cause I really –

02:23:53.083 --> 02:23:55.395
- I really don't know how this started.
- Marian, look at me!

02:23:55.419 --> 02:23:57.962
- You don't have any panties on.
- Do you know how this started?

02:23:58.046 --> 02:24:00.798
What do you think you are,
one of your goddamn paintings?

02:24:03.051 --> 02:24:05.386
Marian, I'm giving you
a chance to come clean,

02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:08.472
clear the slate,
on to a higher consciousness.

02:24:08.557 --> 02:24:11.392
And then,
don't ever lie to me again, Marian.

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:15.730
- This is not like you, Ralph.
- What, to demand? You're right, Marian.

02:24:15.814 --> 02:24:18.149
But I wanna know.
I wanna know the truth.

02:24:18.233 --> 02:24:21.736
- We're just talking, right?
- Yes, Marian. We're just talking!

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:26.157
- You want me to tell you the truth?
- That's all I've ever asked, Marian.

02:24:26.241 --> 02:24:28.284
Okay.

02:24:32.622 --> 02:24:35.082
He kissed me.

02:24:35.167 --> 02:24:38.169
- Does that satisfy you?
- Did it satisfy you?

02:24:38.253 --> 02:24:40.755
Everybody was pretty far gone,
as you may or may not know.

02:24:40.839 --> 02:24:43.507
Marian, I don't really need
all this perspective, just the facts.

02:24:43.592 --> 02:24:46.010
All right. All right, Ralph. Okay.

02:24:46.094 --> 02:24:50.848
Somehow – Somehow the two of us
were elected to go out and get liquor.

02:24:50.932 --> 02:24:52.808
We drove to the Foremost,
which was closed,

02:24:52.893 --> 02:24:55.895
and then to Cappy's, which was
also closed – everything was closed.

02:24:55.979 --> 02:24:58.564
I mean, I was beginning to wonder
whether anything would be open.

02:24:58.648 --> 02:25:01.525
All I could think of were those
all-night supermarkets, and –

02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:05.446
I wondered whether anybody
would even be in the mood for a drink

02:25:05.530 --> 02:25:08.783
if we had to drive around half the night
looking for an open market.

02:25:08.867 --> 02:25:10.993
He was really drunk.

02:25:11.078 --> 02:25:13.871
I hadn't even realized how drunk he was
until we started driving.

02:25:13.955 --> 02:25:16.791
And he was driving –
he was driving terribly slow.

02:25:16.875 --> 02:25:19.710
He was all hunched over the wheel,
and we were talking.

02:25:19.795 --> 02:25:21.879
We were talking about a lot of things.

02:25:21.963 --> 02:25:24.131
A lot of things that didn't make sense

02:25:24.216 --> 02:25:26.550
I mean, about, uh, religious images

02:25:26.635 --> 02:25:28.135
and about this –

02:25:29.137 --> 02:25:31.639
about this painter,
this painter named Larry Rivers.

02:25:31.723 --> 02:25:35.476
And, uh – And then he started talking
about Norman Mailer

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:41.065
and about how Norman Mailer
stabbed his wife in the breast.

02:25:41.149 --> 02:25:44.610
And he said he'd hate it
if anybody did that to me.

02:25:45.654 --> 02:25:47.780
He said he'd like to kiss my breast.

02:25:47.864 --> 02:25:51.283
And then he pulled the car over
to the side of the road, and...

02:25:51.368 --> 02:25:53.285
then he kissed me.

02:25:55.747 --> 02:25:57.998
How long?

02:26:02.712 --> 02:26:04.630
How long what?

02:26:04.714 --> 02:26:06.674
How long did he kiss you?

02:26:11.888 --> 02:26:14.682
Then what?

02:26:17.394 --> 02:26:19.478
Then he said,
"Do you wanna have a go at it?"

02:26:19.563 --> 02:26:23.107
Jesus, Marian.
"Do you wanna have a go at it?"

02:26:23.191 --> 02:26:26.944
What –
"Do you wanna have a go at it?

02:26:27.028 --> 02:26:29.155
Do you wanna have a go at it?"

02:26:29.239 --> 02:26:33.117
What does that mean, Marian?
"Do you wanna have a go at it?"

02:26:33.201 --> 02:26:35.327
Did he kiss your tits?
Did you touch him?

02:26:35.412 --> 02:26:38.247
Touch him? Touch him?

02:26:38.331 --> 02:26:41.250
Okay, Ralph.
Ralph, you wanna know what happened?

02:26:41.334 --> 02:26:43.419
He kissed me, and I kissed him back.

02:26:43.503 --> 02:26:46.005
And then we did it.
We did it right there in the car.

02:26:46.089 --> 02:26:48.132
He fucked me right there in the car.

02:26:48.216 --> 02:26:50.468
I was drunk.
It didn't mean anything to me.

02:26:50.552 --> 02:26:52.470
I wish it hadn't happened,
but it did.

02:26:52.554 --> 02:26:56.140
Is that all? Is that all you wanna know?
Is that all?

02:27:03.607 --> 02:27:05.566
Yes, Marian.

02:27:07.903 --> 02:27:10.404
- That's all.
- Ralph, he didn't come in me.

02:27:10.489 --> 02:27:14.533
- I swear to God, he didn't come in me.
- Okay.

02:27:14.618 --> 02:27:17.077
Where are you going, Ralph?

02:27:18.747 --> 02:27:23.250
Well, Marian, we have guests coming,
and I'm gonna go and light the barbecue.

- Come in. Come on in.

02:30:45.537 --> 02:30:47.454
- We're not early, are we?
- No, not at all.

02:30:47.539 --> 02:30:49.475
- Did you have any trouble finding the house?
- Not at all.

- Where did you get them?
- Uh, they're mine. I painted them.

- How was the trip?

02:31:16.568 --> 02:31:20.070
- Oh, not bad. Took the 405 to the 10 –
- No, I meant the fishing trip.

Oh, it was great.

02:31:23.241 --> 02:31:26.160
I got it right here. Want me to take it
to the kitchen or something, or –

02:31:26.244 --> 02:31:28.328
Why don't we just
take it out to the barbecue?

02:31:28.413 --> 02:31:30.664
Okay. Out here, huh?

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.209
- You like fishing?
- Oh, I love to fish.

02:31:34.294 --> 02:31:35.753
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

02:31:35.837 --> 02:31:38.756
- Is that your hobby, fishing?
- No, not really.

02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.758
Uh, I do enjoy it though.

02:31:40.842 --> 02:31:42.862
But I don't like fishing in boats
because I don't swim.

02:31:42.886 --> 02:31:46.472
- So I'll go to lakes or rivers.
- I'll give you a tour. We can...

02:31:46.556 --> 02:31:50.392
- start with the upstairs.
- Oh, look at this.

02:31:50.477 --> 02:31:52.770
- I'll show you the bedrooms first.
- Okay.

02:31:52.854 --> 02:31:55.564
I don't get out as much as I'd like to.

02:31:55.648 --> 02:31:58.192
How about you?
You a fisherman?

02:32:19.881 --> 02:32:23.509
I'm sorry I had to do that,
but you just got out of line.

Come on, Bill.

02:32:25.595 --> 02:32:28.722
- And I know I'm just a gardener.
- I'm getting tired of this.

02:32:28.807 --> 02:32:34.311
Good-bye. Oh, no, let me
fix it there for you. Don't.

02:32:34.395 --> 02:32:37.064
- Bill, this has taken fucking hours.
- Yeah, well, you know.

02:32:37.148 --> 02:32:39.817
- Come on.
- Stop it, stop it. Don't move.

02:32:39.901 --> 02:32:42.152
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Don't lean on me like that.

02:32:42.237 --> 02:32:45.197
- I'm taking this thing out too.
- No. Okay, okay.

02:32:45.281 --> 02:32:47.009
- Just keep it in for the picture.
- Hold on a second.

02:32:47.033 --> 02:32:49.326
Support your husband.

02:32:49.410 --> 02:32:51.578
Now, look like I –
like someone really hurt you

02:32:51.663 --> 02:32:53.831
like Earl beat you.

02:32:53.915 --> 02:32:55.374
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

02:32:55.458 --> 02:32:57.292
- Did he?
- You know he didn't.

02:32:57.377 --> 02:32:59.146
I know he didn't literally.
What else did he do?

02:32:59.170 --> 02:33:01.171
What do you think about
when you think about Earl?

02:33:01.256 --> 02:33:04.383
Can we stop?
I don't wanna talk about that, okay?

02:33:04.467 --> 02:33:06.570
- Come on, Bill. Let's get going.
- I was in the shower sometimes

02:33:06.594 --> 02:33:08.572
and I hear the sound of the water
going down the drain

02:33:08.596 --> 02:33:10.574
and I think it's somebody hurting you
in the other room and it scares me.

02:33:10.598 --> 02:33:12.933
- Bill, come on.
- Open your blouse a little for this one.

02:33:13.017 --> 02:33:15.352
- No, I don't do those shots.
- Come on, just for me.

02:33:15.436 --> 02:33:17.748
I don't wanna do this anymore. I've been
doing this for – I've been very patient.

02:33:17.772 --> 02:33:20.899
- I mean, I could've sped up the process.
- No.

my quick version.

- But I didn't, because I loved you so.
- I love you too.

02:33:35.206 --> 02:33:38.458
Why did that excite me? I started getting
a little chubby when I was doing that.

02:33:38.543 --> 02:33:41.253
That's weird.
Okay, this is my last request.

02:33:41.337 --> 02:33:44.047

- Okay. This is it, okay.

02:33:44.132 --> 02:33:47.050
- Let's go. Where do you want this?
- Right under your armpit.

- Okay.

02:33:49.512 --> 02:33:52.180
- All right. It's perfect now.
- I want you to just hold this.

02:33:52.265 --> 02:33:55.601
- You're dead, and your husband is a creep.
- All right. Okay, go.

02:33:55.685 --> 02:33:58.395

02:37:36.697 --> 02:37:38.615
- Ooh.
- All right.

02:37:38.699 --> 02:37:41.618
This time you be Alex Trebek now, okay?
Time to switch.

02:37:41.702 --> 02:37:44.348
- Finished with this one. Let's switch.
- We're gonna switch places?

02:37:44.372 --> 02:37:47.791
- Okay, Stuart, you have to sit in the middle.
- Does Alex Trebek cheat?

02:37:47.875 --> 02:37:50.043
Move over.
You gotta be in the middle.

02:37:52.004 --> 02:37:53.922

- You said 10 minutes an inch, Stuart.

02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:09.146
I did. The thickness, not the length.

02:44:13.385 --> 02:44:17.639
You know, when I was in art school,
I had a teacher.

02:44:18.891 --> 02:44:21.601
Eventually killed himself.
He couldn't sell anything.

02:44:23.229 --> 02:44:26.564
But he used to have us paint
with sticks and rocks

like cavemen or something.

02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:33.112
I guess it was supposed to be like –

02:44:34.448 --> 02:44:40.161
He never allowed brushes
or pencils or – or real paint –

02:44:40.246 --> 02:44:42.247
the paint you could buy, anyway –

02:44:43.874 --> 02:44:47.001

The bakery's closed for business.

- Hey, you're not allowed in here.
- Mr. Bitkower.

02:46:39.239 --> 02:46:41.908
- What do you want?
- I'm Casey's mother. This is Casey's father.

02:46:41.992 --> 02:46:44.077
I'm busy.
You come back when I'm open.

02:46:44.161 --> 02:46:46.579
- No.
- All right.

02:46:46.664 --> 02:46:49.666
You want your cake now. Is that it?
You finally want the cake you ordered?

02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:51.936
We wanna talk to you about the cake
that wasn't picked up.

02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:54.253
- Or paid for.
- You're a terrible person, Mr. Bitkower.

02:46:54.338 --> 02:46:56.255
It cost me time and money
to make that cake.

02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:58.216
I have work to do.
I don't wanna talk to you.

02:46:58.300 --> 02:47:00.528
You're gonna talk to her,
or I'm gonna knock you on your ass, pal.

02:47:00.552 --> 02:47:05.014
- How can you be so cheap and insensitive?
- Lady, I work 16 hours a day to make ends meet.

02:47:05.099 --> 02:47:08.184
- I bake all night and work all day.
- Oh, you bake all night?

02:47:08.268 --> 02:47:11.771
I thought you made
phone calls at night, you bastard.

02:47:14.316 --> 02:47:17.944
I'll call somebody.
Get out of my store.

02:47:20.155 --> 02:47:22.699
I don't want any trouble here.

02:47:25.619 --> 02:47:27.620
My son is dead.

02:47:28.956 --> 02:47:31.040
He is dead, Mr. Bitkower.

02:47:31.125 --> 02:47:34.919
He was hit by a car
the day I came in here to order the cake.

02:47:35.003 --> 02:47:37.755
We have been waiting with him
until he died.

02:47:38.465 --> 02:47:40.883
And now he is dead.

02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:44.011
There are no more birthdays.

02:47:47.141 --> 02:47:49.058

Here, sit down.

I've never seen more
fucking homeless people.

02:48:35.189 --> 02:48:37.899
Hey, you. Drink that. Don't spill it.

02:48:39.526 --> 02:48:41.944
- So –
- Josette, stay in the car.

02:48:42.029 --> 02:48:44.007

02:48:44.031 --> 02:48:45.490
- Cigarettes.
- Beers.

- Where you going?

02:48:52.623 --> 02:48:56.209
We're going to get Aunt Honey's
photographs. You watch Josette.

02:49:01.799 --> 02:49:05.301
What was your last name?
Keep your eye on her.
Don't let her get to the edge.

02:49:05.385 --> 02:49:08.304
- No, Honey Bush.
- Keep your eye on your sister.

02:49:08.388 --> 02:49:10.306

02:49:10.390 --> 02:49:14.560
Hey, Mr. Johnson, how's it going?
Thank you. Sorry.

02:49:14.645 --> 02:49:17.814

- Yeah. That's how much it is.

- Thank you.

02:49:24.071 --> 02:49:25.988
Who are these?

02:49:26.073 --> 02:49:29.534
She's dead.

02:49:43.173 --> 02:49:46.676
- Ew, that is gross.
- She's dead.

02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:49.011
Ew, Honey, he's coming. Go.

02:49:49.096 --> 02:49:51.597
- Oh, my God.
- Careful.

02:50:06.780 --> 02:50:09.448
Come on, get in.
Are we gonna do this picnic or what?

02:50:10.784 --> 02:50:12.743
Do you have a pen? "7NZ" –

02:50:12.828 --> 02:50:14.996
- He's going to that one.
- Come on.

02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:17.081
Remember this. "7NZ699."

02:50:17.165 --> 02:50:19.083

02:50:33.265 --> 02:50:38.394
You make the food look like
a little show down there on the plate.

02:50:38.478 --> 02:50:42.732
It looks like a little stage with little –
little sausage people on it.

02:50:42.816 --> 02:50:44.901
It's so cute.

02:50:45.944 --> 02:50:48.029

Don't worry about it.

02:50:55.787 --> 02:50:57.705
It's all temporary.

02:50:59.082 --> 02:51:01.292
Oh, I don't want it to be over.

02:51:01.376 --> 02:51:03.711
- We'll do it again.
- When?

02:51:03.795 --> 02:51:07.757
Well, I've got three round trips
out of JFK to Berlin.

02:51:07.841 --> 02:51:12.428
And then a little stopover in Bangkok
that I requested, a four-day layover there.

02:51:12.512 --> 02:51:17.016
That'll be great.
So, uh, next month.

02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:21.354
- Maybe we should go to Hawaii.
- Yeah.

02:51:21.438 --> 02:51:24.732
Chad could stay with his father.
I mean, he'll be in school, right?

02:51:24.816 --> 02:51:28.486
- Chad had a great time.
- Wally had a great time.

02:51:28.570 --> 02:51:31.322

02:51:31.406 --> 02:51:33.324

Here, eat these. You need to
eat something to keep going.

Eating's a good thing

02:54:39.052 --> 02:54:41.637
- Thank you.
- I hope you like my muffins.

I'd like to see the cake.

02:54:58.280 --> 02:54:59.864
You can't.

Okay.

Wait, I-I – I know you.

From, uh – No, I'm sure I do.
From that photo shoot.

02:57:16.042 --> 02:57:18.104
- When I did your makeup.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

02:57:18.128 --> 02:57:20.106
The maquillage for the photo shoot.
I'm a makeup artist.

02:57:20.130 --> 02:57:22.191
I thought that you were
someone I'd done for a shoot.

02:57:22.215 --> 02:57:24.341
- That funny?
- Sorry.

02:57:24.426 --> 02:57:26.343
Are you guys actresses or models?

02:57:26.428 --> 02:57:28.721
We're not either. I'm –
We're not either one.

02:57:28.805 --> 02:57:31.974
You're not? I just mean, just 'cause
you have the looks for it. You could be.

02:57:32.058 --> 02:57:34.685
If, you know, if you wanted to.

02:57:34.769 --> 02:57:39.732
Well, if it happened, that would be okay.
If it doesn't, that's okay too.

02:57:39.816 --> 02:57:43.152
But, hey, I mean, sometimes
I do some talent scout stuff too and –

02:57:43.236 --> 02:57:46.405
I mean, if you ever want to.
I'm Bill. This is Jerry.

02:57:46.489 --> 02:57:48.615
You want a beer?

02:57:48.700 --> 02:57:50.993
No, thanks. You want –

02:57:51.077 --> 02:57:55.164
- No, that's okay.
- So, have you done any movie stars?

02:57:55.248 --> 02:57:57.166
Uh, yeah – Yes, ma'am.

02:57:57.250 --> 02:57:59.835
Really? Who was the biggest
movie star you've done?

What was that last one I did?
What was that big one I did last time?

02:58:06.092 --> 02:58:08.427
I think it was Roseanne Barr.

02:58:08.511 --> 02:58:10.512
- She's big.
- She's huge.

02:58:10.597 --> 02:58:13.891
- You're lying. I can tell you're lying.
- Yeah, that didn't work.

02:58:13.975 --> 02:58:17.353

- I'm Barbara. That's Nancy.

02:58:17.437 --> 02:58:19.813
Hi.

02:58:20.857 --> 02:58:24.526
- So, you married?
- No.

02:58:24.611 --> 02:58:26.570
Uh, we were.

02:58:27.781 --> 02:58:29.698
Very unfortunate, what happened.

Uh, I'll have one of those beers.

02:58:32.994 --> 02:58:35.829
Hey, you know what's a hundred yards away?
You know the Bat Caves?

02:58:35.914 --> 02:58:37.767
You ever watch Batman?
Remember the series Batman?

02:58:37.791 --> 02:58:39.751
- Yeah.
- Well, the Bat Caves where they shot it –

02:58:39.793 --> 02:58:41.513
Let me show you this cave.
Here's your beer.

Let me take Barbara away
from you for one second.

02:58:43.546 --> 02:58:45.649
Come here. It'll just take a second.
Don't worry about it.

02:58:45.673 --> 02:58:47.883
- Okay, I'll just have one beer.
- All right, one.

02:58:47.967 --> 02:58:49.968
Come here.
Don't worry about it.

02:58:50.053 --> 02:58:52.221
Where you guys live?
- Malibu.
-Come back.

02:58:52.305 --> 02:58:54.033
- That's on the beach, right?
- Yep, it's on the beach.

02:58:54.057 --> 02:58:57.101
Can I have a beer? Thanks.

02:58:57.602 --> 02:59:01.063
Oh, Jesus. Excuse me.

02:59:01.147 --> 02:59:03.399
No, it's one of the streets that goes up.

02:59:03.483 --> 02:59:05.401
- Oh.
- Come here. It's right down here.

02:59:05.485 --> 02:59:08.112
- Do you mind?
- We had a place up there for a while.

02:59:08.196 --> 02:59:10.155
Now, after we split up
with our wives, you know –

02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:12.741
- Oh, you lived with your wives?
- Well, yeah.

02:59:12.826 --> 02:59:15.452
So now we got this place.

02:59:15.537 --> 02:59:17.996

Don't – Leave me –
