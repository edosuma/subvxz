<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

00:33.800 --> 00:35.233
Mr Selfridge.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.192
Frank, what a great day. Peace at last.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.556
The streets were full last night
like the armistice all over again.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.910
Only better. This is a beginning, not an end.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.674
And as a nation celebrates,
Selfridges will too.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.392
We need something that...
That speaks to people.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.391
Something that captures the mood.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.077
So tell me, Head of Print and Public Relations,

00:58.480 --> 01:00.357
what does the peace treaty mean
for the man on the street?

01:00.920 --> 01:02.478
The first proper holiday for five years.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.154
Perfect.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.359
Trips to the seaside, picnics in the park...

01:09.520 --> 01:11.112
Cricket and cream teas...

01:12.000 --> 01:13.319
Britain on Holiday?

01:13.480 --> 01:14.833
Britain at Play.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.030
Brief the heads of the departments,
they'll have ideas.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.510
And I want press and advertising everywhere.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.999
- Good morning, Miss Plunkett.
- Good morning.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.399
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:23.720 --> 01:24.755
How much can I spend?

01:24.840 --> 01:27.877
Whatever it takes.
I have shareholders snapping at my heels.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.719
We need all eyes on Selfridges.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.029
I'll talk to Mr Crabb.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.594
Make sure that he's sitting down first.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.918
You give it a bash. And again.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.150
And then you cut its head off.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.438
You don't mind taking him again, do you?

01:46.600 --> 01:49.239
I've got no job to go to.
It's no trouble, honestly.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.468
And we're getting on like a house on fire,
aren't we, Ernest?

01:53.320 --> 01:54.833
I really am very grateful, George.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.508
How is Mr Grove?

01:59.440 --> 02:00.668
I haven't seen him.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.278
Well, he must be missing his family.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.469
It seems hard that kids always get shipped off
to aunties and the like when their mum...

02:12.640 --> 02:14.153
I can take Ernest to see him.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.469
Cheer them both up.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.997
Emily, would you mind watching Ernest
for a moment?

02:19.080 --> 02:20.513
George, may I have a word?

02:25.440 --> 02:27.271
There's something I need to tell you
about Ernest

02:27.880 --> 02:29.313
and Mr Grove.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.513
I don't want to intrude.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.314
How are you?

02:42.720 --> 02:44.153
Well enough.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.636
I bought this for my godson.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.949
It goes at quite a speed if you wind it right up.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.748
How thoughtful.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.788
How are the children?

02:58.120 --> 03:00.759
The girls are with their grandmother in Essex.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.113
Arthur...

03:04.320 --> 03:06.959
...as you know, and Jacob
are in Bristol with their aunt.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.759
And Ernest

03:10.520 --> 03:12.112
is still with Miss Mardle?

03:15.880 --> 03:18.155
Mrs Crabb has knitted him a little cardigan

03:20.960 --> 03:22.279
with a matching hat.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.359
Perhaps I should give them to Miss Mardle.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.519
Thank you.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.475
Ladies,

03:49.560 --> 03:53.030
Mr Edwards wants to hear your thoughts
for our Britain at Play event.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.519
Mrs Edwards?

03:55.160 --> 03:57.879
Girls want to put on powder and rouge
wherever they are.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.919
We could offer portable
beauty and cosmetics.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.318
- Miss Calthorpe?
- Er, we've got lots of new hats in.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.674
They're getting much smaller.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.472
Why, heads aren't shrinking, are they?

04:10.560 --> 04:13.518
They're more practical
for motoring and golf.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.517
A cocktail party, day out at the beach.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.158
We've got sunhats...

04:18.240 --> 04:19.753
Let's have a look.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.478
While you're waiting...

04:24.800 --> 04:26.995
Beauty could have a theme to display...

04:27.680 --> 04:29.272
One of the first things the customer sees...

04:29.400 --> 04:31.391
He'll be back in a minute.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.352
I think this one, Connie.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.199
- Yes.
- Miss Mardle.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.716
- May I have a word?
- Oh, yes, of course, Mr Crabb.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.433
Carry on, Connie. Yeah?

04:42.920 --> 04:45.559
Mr Grove is back. Have you spoken to him?

04:45.640 --> 04:48.950
No, he hasn't talked to me since, erm...

04:50.760 --> 04:51.988
The night Ernest came to me.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.799
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.074
Oh...

04:55.160 --> 04:56.639
Well, it's not your fault.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.471
Mrs Crabb made some clothes for Ernest.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.959
Oh...

05:01.960 --> 05:03.552
Oh!

05:04.200 --> 05:06.350
She's in a knitting frenzy at the moment.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.355
Ernest will have plenty of woollens for winter,

05:10.640 --> 05:12.119
wherever he is by then.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.553
Thank you, Mr Crabb.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.713
I couldn't get a word in.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.990
Standing there like a lemon.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.557
Make an appointment with Mr Edwards.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.835
Run things past him without
Queen Kitty there.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.992
She'd have your guts for garters
if she heard that.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.468
Mr Gordon!

05:43.560 --> 05:46.870
I was just
helping Miss Calthorpe.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.473
I wanted some wool.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.074
I'll come back later.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.839
Oh, my goodness.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.595
Is Mr Selfridge in?

06:10.680 --> 06:12.910
- Miss Webb?
- Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.671
Nancy, I wasn't expecting you.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.394
I received a letter from
the Housing Department.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.273
They'll give us the funding as soon as
we give them our full budget.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.791
That's great, isn't it?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.558
It means I'll be very busy.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.314
Well...

06:35.680 --> 06:36.795
Erm...

06:39.720 --> 06:41.039
So, I've been thinking,

06:42.040 --> 06:44.759
and I want to take a step back from us.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.558
I mean, this was supposed to be
purely professional.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.752
It's just about the estate, but...

06:53.280 --> 06:57.592
We've been spending so much time together
I think I've lost perspective.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.031
I wasn't expecting this either
but it doesn't make it wrong.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.673
I need to focus on my work.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.228
- If it's help you need...
- I'm quite capable...

07:07.440 --> 07:11.035
- Or time...
- I need to stop thinking about you.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.353
Take a step back.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.633
Just until I get the job done.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.713
Didn't realise I was such a distraction.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.671
But if that's what you want...

07:31.400 --> 07:32.958
Thank you.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.319
Uh, once they have the budget,
then the funds should be here pretty soon.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.992
You should secure services.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.311
- That'll cost.
- Well, we can't wait.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.708
Will 1,000 do it?

07:43.240 --> 07:44.559
Yes.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.793
Mmm-hmm.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.912
Thank you.

08:18.520 --> 08:19.794
Excuse me.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.516
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Simmons.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.919
One moment.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.719
Victor?

08:30.240 --> 08:31.798
Regan's men.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.753
Everything all right?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.199
Looking good.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.836
So, you're a pilot, Mr Sibour?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.598
<i>Vicomte</i> de Sibour.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.349
You can call me Jacques.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.629
Yes, I was a captain in the
French Air Force during the war.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.876
Jacques was decorated for bravery
by both the French and the British.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.832
And you're going to be working with
my son-in-law.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.310
Jacques will make a series of flights
from one city to another.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.395
My job will be to drum up
press interest and attract investment.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.631
Then we can set up commercial flights
on the same routes.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.994
And what about your plane?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.152
Is getting that in the air part of your plan?

09:50.440 --> 09:53.671
Erm, maybe one day,
but I have others to think of now.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.552
I need to keep my feet on the ground.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.075
Have you ever flown in a plane,
Miss Selfridge?

10:01.760 --> 10:03.990
Yes, I loved it.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.834
It's like a different world,

10:06.480 --> 10:07.879
above the clouds.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.518
Everything seems so far away.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.118
Get out, the pair of ya. This is my club!

10:43.200 --> 10:44.918
This is Regan's place!

10:45.040 --> 10:46.359
Don't ever forget that!

10:54.720 --> 10:56.039
You're bleeding!

10:56.240 --> 10:57.514
Get the band playing.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.713
Joe!

11:00.600 --> 11:02.511
I need you to make sure this is cleaned.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.194
- No glass. No glass.
- Yes, Elsa. Yes.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.278
Make sure. All right?

11:23.680 --> 11:25.750
I thought I could keep them apart.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.313
Regan's room, my club...

11:30.840 --> 11:32.831
But his lot will cause trouble whatever I do.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.234
He needs to sort it out
and you've got to tell him.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.879
Regan?

11:39.680 --> 11:42.319
You know, when I first met you,
you said you had a dream.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.795
You said you wanted to be
your own boss, remember?

11:45.760 --> 11:47.512
So? What are you doing?

11:49.120 --> 11:50.599
You haven't been running this place.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.955
Too busy swanning around with
Violette Selfridge.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.388
Don't.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.236
Regan wants gambling? Fine.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.514
I've worked the casinos

12:02.600 --> 12:06.229
and you wouldn't believe the money that
changes hands if you get the right crowd in.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.197
Reagan can't do that, but you...

12:09.560 --> 12:10.709
You can...

12:12.920 --> 12:14.353
...if you want to.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.473
- Morning.
- Morning.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.679
Dinner went well last night.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.359
Mmm.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.114
I thought Nancy might have joined us.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.157
You two seem to have grown very close.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.711
She called things to a halt
while we work on the estate.

12:44.880 --> 12:45.915
Oh.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.479
Some might think that she was being prudent.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.833
Oh, I don't know.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.319
Came right out of the blue.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.193
We're getting on so well together.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.510
Does her family know about you and her?

12:56.840 --> 12:58.751
Well, she doesn't really have a family.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.034
Well, there is a brother...

13:00.560 --> 13:01.879
What's he like?

13:02.640 --> 13:03.959
I haven't met him.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.996
Pretty much always working.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.596
That's not quite true, is it?

13:09.040 --> 13:11.998
Unless you have a lot of overnight meetings.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.556
If Nancy wants to do her job properly
without distraction,

13:16.640 --> 13:17.834
good for her.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.832
The estate will be finished soon enough.

13:20.360 --> 13:24.148
And then you'll have all the time in the world
to get to know each other better.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.834
Now, golfing outfits, er, walking skirts?

13:30.920 --> 13:32.433
- Uh-huh.
- Good. Ah!

13:32.520 --> 13:35.398
- Tennis dresses, here we are.
- Oh! Hold on a mo.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.795
Miss Lenglen, Wimbledon champion.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.792
Goodness, that's a short skirt.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.551
With hardly any sleeves!

13:47.840 --> 13:49.671
I like the silhouette.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.235
- It's almost Coco Chanel.
- Ooh!

13:54.520 --> 13:55.794
Mmm-hmm.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.552
I've been reading those magazines
you lent me.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.437
Oh, very good.
I've got some more at home that you can have.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.511
Goodness, we must get a move on.
Look, we've got to tidy this...

14:01.600 --> 14:03.272
Ooh, look!

14:04.280 --> 14:05.679
Going flying?

14:08.240 --> 14:09.514
We open shortly.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.079
Oh, Mr Grove...

14:12.120 --> 14:14.680
This looks like a church sale. Get it tidied up.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.599
Excuse me a moment, Connie.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.354
I need to talk to you.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.714
Fourth floor.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.068
Alistair's been with me for three weeks now.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.872
He can't stay forever.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.512
- He's just a year old.
- This is neither the time nor the place.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.874
Then when are we to discuss this, Mr Grove?

15:09.720 --> 15:11.472
I know you're angry with me.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.110
But Ernest deserves better than this.

15:18.400 --> 15:22.632
If you are determined to ignore him,
I must approach his natural father.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.955
- Billy has a...
- Never mention his name

15:26.160 --> 15:27.479
in my presence!

15:30.640 --> 15:32.278
You're not yourself, Mr Grove.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.833
And, goodness, you just lost your wife...

15:33.960 --> 15:35.439
I lost her when she broke her marriage vows.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.080
My life since then has been a lie
in which you have been complicit.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.715
Ernest cannot be handed around
like lost luggage.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.439
I counted you a friend.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.353
Please leave my office.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.233
Oh, yes.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.679
Ah, just the man I wanted.
<i>Monsieur</i> Longchamp.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.638
This is Mr Balotoff and <i>Vicomte</i> de Sibour.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.753
<i>Monsieur</i> Longchamp is our head of display.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.558
So, you're the chap
doing our aviation display.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.634
Am I?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.358
I wanted to talk to you about that.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.678
Perhaps something in fashion.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.200
I... I would like to look around.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.471
A tour of Selfridges with a Selfridge.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.918
Er, well, I'm actually a bit busy.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.354
Oh, no, excuse me.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.118
I mean with Rosalie.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.914
- Oh.
- My pleasure.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.279
Come on, Gordon.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.152
There's going to be a raffle to win
a flight with <i>Vicomte</i> de Sibour.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.038
So we'll need some sort of display.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.032
- In fashion?
- Mmm.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.149
And what has an aeroplane to do
with fashion?

17:02.600 --> 17:03.874
What...

17:05.280 --> 17:06.872
- Mr Gordon.
- Mr Crabb.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.270
Erm, when you have a moment,
there's something I'd like to discuss.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.790
A shame your sister wasn't able to join us.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.271
Violette's not herself at the moment.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.078
She's usually pretty lively.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.634
Yes, Princess Marie told me she had
been in a little trouble?

17:29.400 --> 17:32.073
She was going out to a club. Lots of girls do.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.833
And she was arrested.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.036
The club was raided, they arrested everyone.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.716
She shouldn't have been there,
of course, but...

17:40.160 --> 17:41.309
...she was seeing someone.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.799
It's over now.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.636
And Princess Marie shouldn't be gossiping.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.430
Well, you know,
these are the mistakes of youth.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.591
A storm that will blow itself out.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.675
We're giving away 100 hampers.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.033
Well, we'll certainly get attention.

18:06.440 --> 18:07.839
Yes, but will it boost profit?

18:08.400 --> 18:11.790
This event budget is extraordinarily high,
even for the chief.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.073
It's all very well getting people in
to admire the show,

18:15.160 --> 18:17.628
but the more we spend, the more they have to.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.597
Oh, er, there's something else.

18:22.120 --> 18:25.078
Er... I hope you won't mind...

18:27.080 --> 18:29.674
Mrs Crabb asked me to pass these on to you.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.833
It's about,

18:32.160 --> 18:35.755
mature, educated women
happy to provide care of children.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.352
For a man in your position,
they can act <i>in loco parentis.</i>

18:42.720 --> 18:45.632
It must be very hard for you and the children,
being away from each other.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.513
I do not wish my personal life
to be discussed.

18:52.040 --> 18:55.874
My domestic arrangements need not
concern Mrs Crabb any further.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.799
It was just a thought.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.760
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.519
Lord Loxley.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.953
I'm sure you've seen Selfridges'
latest press campaign.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.314
One could hardly miss it.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.072
A very patriotic gesture.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.079
Indeed.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.754
It promises to be
the usual Selfridge spectacle.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.789
As major shareholders,
perhaps we should pay a visit.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.315
Lend our support.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.475
Look at things from a business perspective.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.233
Good idea, Loxley.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.919
- Yes.
- Mmm.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.118
George Towler!

20:05.240 --> 20:07.629
Connie Hawkins. You scrub up well!

20:08.480 --> 20:09.799
What are you wearing?

20:14.360 --> 20:15.952
I was after Miss Mardle.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.278
She's got some magazines for me on couture.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.152
Oh, well, she's not back yet.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.271
Hang on.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.398
Come here, you little tinker!

20:32.640 --> 20:33.789
This is Ernest.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.554
Mr Grove's youngest.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.228
I'm helping to look after him.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.234
What?

20:42.280 --> 20:43.679
You?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.159
Looking after a baby?

20:45.720 --> 20:46.948
Why not?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.833
If you can sell frocks to posh ladies
without scaring them...

20:50.520 --> 20:52.272
What, you can be a nanny?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.596
Miss Mardle said you're doing
very well in fashion.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.836
Mmm. Well, I try.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.035
Er, I've got to give Ernest his tea in a minute.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.428
Well, I won't keep you.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.632
Tell Miss Mardle I called.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.072
I'll get the magazines another time.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.391
Nice seeing you, Miss Hawkins.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.954
And you, Mr Towler.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.877
Bye, Ernest.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.359
What are you doing?

21:45.040 --> 21:46.439
What does it look like?

21:47.360 --> 21:49.590
Waiting for Harry Selfridge?

21:51.240 --> 21:52.878
He won't be coming round again.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.868
What?

21:55.440 --> 21:56.475
I did what you said.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.710
I told him I needed to take a step back.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.359
You were right, I should never have
slept with him in the first place.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.668
But you did.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.871
And you can't just stop now.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.029
I told you to get a grip on yourself,
not push him away!

22:11.280 --> 22:12.759
We could lose everything.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.319
I didn't say it was over.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.715
I said we had to wait
until the estate was finished.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.719
What did he say?

22:20.600 --> 22:21.828
He wrote me a cheque.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.113
｣1,000.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.114
Clever girl.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.513
He's really fallen for you, hasn't he?

22:44.360 --> 22:45.839
We're so close now.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.359
We just keep ahold of that dream.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.989
America, you and me!

22:52.040 --> 22:53.598
A life we've always wanted.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.033
Huh?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.599
Welcome to your
special preview of our biggest event,

23:09.240 --> 23:10.719
Britain at Play.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.553
With the peace treaty signed,

23:12.680 --> 23:14.830
we felt we should celebrate
along with the nation.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.590
Whether it's a day at the races, a picnic,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.272
a game of golf or tennis,

23:19.640 --> 23:21.517
or even a flight in an aeroplane...

23:21.720 --> 23:24.188
At Selfridges, we have the best of everything.

23:24.680 --> 23:29.037
Did I mention we have 100 packed hampers
ready to give away?

23:33.480 --> 23:36.392
Gentlemen, if you'd like to follow me
to the fourth floor, please.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.634
Pleasure flights remain the privilege of a few.

23:41.520 --> 23:45.274
But this week, customers at Selfridges
can enter a raffle

23:45.480 --> 23:49.109
to win a flight with the renowned aviator
<i>Vicomte</i> de Sibour.

23:52.520 --> 23:55.557
All the money raised will go to
the Selfridge Estate Fund.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.230
We have some very modern sporting wear.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.671
And some very wearable outfits
for leisure and travel.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.510
Gentlemen, if there are any further questions,
please come forward.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.199
Gentlemen, please.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.793
I've packed everything he needs.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.880
Now, whatever you do,
don't lose yellow rabbit.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.078
Thought I'd take him for a picnic

24:31.600 --> 24:32.874
and a ride on the bus.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.548
He'll love that.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.756
Yeah. Let me go and get him for you.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.193
George.

24:39.480 --> 24:43.393
I wanted to say thank you
for looking after him.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.111
And please, tell Miss Mardle

24:46.840 --> 24:49.400
how one day I hope
I'll have a place of my own.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.669
Then I can take him back for good.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.069
There he is!

25:03.160 --> 25:05.720
I hope you'll forgive me if
I'm speaking out of turn.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.039
I'm just concerned.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.032
Chiefly for Miss Calthorpe.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.712
Are you...

25:13.680 --> 25:15.113
...involved...

25:15.680 --> 25:17.159
...romantically?

25:18.320 --> 25:21.790
Our friendship is surely a private matter.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.118
Private or secret?

25:26.800 --> 25:29.109
I have a great deal of respect
for Miss Calthorpe.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.157
I would never compromise her reputation.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.198
You are Mr Selfridge's son.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.109
You may choose from many paths in life,

25:40.880 --> 25:44.270
Miss Calthorpe has only a few, at best.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.556
You have a responsibility.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.351
Your gambling room is scuppering my club.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.273
They're a rough lot,
and they're starting to keep my lot away.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.191
Colleanos could be closed in a month's time.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.958
I do hope you're not going to disappoint me.

25:59.480 --> 26:02.199
We could all be making a lot more money!

26:08.280 --> 26:11.158
Now, let's say we lose the roulette
in the backroom.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.389
We bring it out front,

26:12.480 --> 26:14.914
we make Colleanos a gambling club.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.358
And there's one thing that means big money.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.239
Baccarat.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.318
If we keep out the rough crowd,
make it exclusive...

26:25.200 --> 26:26.792
A member's club?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.194
Exactly.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.836
See, I know a lot of rich people from when
I used to run the Palm Court at Selfridges.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.399
We want high rollers.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.869
No limits!

26:36.840 --> 26:38.990
Higher stakes means a bigger bank.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.991
Are you asking me for more money?

26:44.480 --> 26:45.754
Yes.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.276
And I'm giving you the chance
to make a lot more.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.669
You're sticking your neck out here,
Mr Colleano

26:52.760 --> 26:56.469
I know how to make money
my way.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.672
But if you think you can do better,

27:01.800 --> 27:04.109
I will want to see results, and fast.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.919
Because if I don't,
my boys will shut you down...

27:08.280 --> 27:09.599
...for good.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.708
I'll take that as a yes, then.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.719
Red is not your colour.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.394
Green would suit you, or grey.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.753
I'm not really looking.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.669
You are drifting.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.074
If you say so.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.277
You are a little lost.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.399
If you say so.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.230
Well, when you tire of pretending
to look at dresses, I will buy you a drink.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.478
I can tell you about my plane journeys.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.037
Where I've been, where I'm going.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.356
Perhaps you will feel a little less lost.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.272
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

28:42.600 --> 28:44.750
Jacques was asking me about you.

28:45.800 --> 28:49.031
Well, I do hope you told him
all about my shameful history.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.355
- That should put him off.
- Actually, it didn't.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.635
- So you did tell him?
- He knew anyway.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.431
Will you stop gossiping about me?

28:58.080 --> 28:59.911
And for god's sake, stop matchmaking!

29:00.000 --> 29:01.797
I just want you to be happy.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.548
What did Mr Crabb say?

29:14.280 --> 29:16.669
He's just worried about tongues wagging.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.319
I told him it was none of his business.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.869
Never mind him.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.639
We need a night out.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.358
At Victor's or somewhere else.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.752
Somewhere that isn't the storeroom.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.508
George Towler.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.551
Mrs Edwards, how are you?

29:49.360 --> 29:50.873
Well, thank you.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.798
Connie said she'd seen you.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.512
I haven't been in here for a while.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.995
- Do you miss it?
- Of course.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.712
Well, you should think about coming back.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.197
Connie said that you were out of a job

30:04.360 --> 30:06.271
and the place hasn't been
the same without you.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.997
Excuse me.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.468
Mr Grove, could I have a word?

30:16.480 --> 30:17.629
It's about Ernest.

30:19.560 --> 30:22.313
Mr Grove, I'm going to have to insist.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.358
Not here.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.234
Miss Mardle! Miss Mardle!

30:36.960 --> 30:39.997
Oh, goodness! We're all late home today.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.032
I just want to say thank you

30:42.600 --> 30:43.953
for looking after Connie.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.598
Oh, it's my pleasure!

30:45.920 --> 30:47.478
Must have the patience of a saint.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.638
She's doing so well here.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.592
Well, I'm glad I'm doing something right.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.436
You've got Mr Grove's youngest
staying with you.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.150
Erm, Connie told me.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.554
Well, just for the time being.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.717
And George is helping out?

31:02.120 --> 31:03.439
Oh.

31:03.640 --> 31:06.029
He's pretty much looking after
Ernest single-handed.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.552
I tried it one weekend,

31:09.400 --> 31:11.118
couldn't wait to get back to work.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.630
I've often wondered what sort of mother
I would have been if I had had children.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.833
I suppose if you've never had the opportunity,
it's very easy to daydream.

31:24.960 --> 31:28.236
It turns out I'm rather lacking
in maternal instinct.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.151
Perhaps work is the only thing
I'm any good at.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.436
No, look how much you've helped Connie!

31:35.520 --> 31:37.795
And all the other girls who've worked for you.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.231
You've been the making of us.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.830
Come on, I'll walk with you.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.919
<i>Miss Mardle told me.</i>

31:47.600 --> 31:50.398
About you and Ernest.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.632
He's a lovely little chap.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.839
Smart as a button.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.590
I wouldn't say boo to a goose
when I was small.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.198
My father was a drunk.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.192
I was terrified of him.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.032
That's why me and Agnes were so close.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.394
She was all the family I had.

32:15.760 --> 32:19.389
He may have been my father,
but he was no parent.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.149
What is it that you want to ask me?

32:24.280 --> 32:25.998
Ernest keeps saying these names.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.393
I don't know who they are.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.513
Arthur?

32:32.280 --> 32:34.191
His brother, three years older.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.438
Ella, or Millie?

32:37.600 --> 32:39.670
Meryl, she's the oldest.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.397
She used to help bath him
and get him dressed.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.876
"Little mother," Doris called her.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.558
Sometimes Ernest wakes up at night,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.433
crying.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.719
And when I comfort him, he points,

32:57.720 --> 32:59.392
as if he wants to go somewhere.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.473
So I carry him

33:03.000 --> 33:04.558
from room to room.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.070
Him pointing and looking.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.153
And he says those names.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.554
And "Mum."

33:14.480 --> 33:16.038
And "Dada."

33:17.800 --> 33:19.995
He's looking for his family, Mr Grove.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.794
He's looking for you.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.079
You've been very busy.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.838
Well, there's a lot more to do.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.315
Well, when this estate is finished
and your work is done,

33:39.400 --> 33:40.799
we'll start over again.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.676
There's a whole world out there
for us to explore.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.876
Restaurants, galleries, theatre...

33:46.480 --> 33:47.833
Just you and me.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.993
Nancy?

33:57.080 --> 33:58.593
I'm sorry.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.990
Miss Calthorpe here can show you
all manner of finery.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.228
Hello.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.588
Gordon!

34:11.320 --> 34:12.719
Oh, excuse me, ladies.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.076
Look, Polly Maxwell Taylor.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.279
She seems pleased to see him.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.553
She's a nice girl.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.039
What does Gordon think?

34:22.120 --> 34:24.031
Mmm, he's spoiled for choice.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.188
Eligible young men are thin on the ground.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.313
They're a good family.

34:30.239 --> 34:32.879
You know Lady Maxwell Taylor's
a charitable one too.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.552
Oh, yes, a stole.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.949
I won't speak about it.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.838
This is the ideal place to start.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.114
Look, isn't it adorable?

34:40.239 --> 34:41.309
Mother would have a fit.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.353
It is one
of our more modish hats.

34:48.239 --> 34:49.831
Gordon, what do you think?

34:50.080 --> 34:51.353
Topping.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.636
That settles it. Tell the girl I'll take it.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.438
I can wear it to the regatta,
cause a stir!

34:56.520 --> 34:58.795
- Miss Calthorpe...
- Of course.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.160
Now, I want to see this exciting aviator.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.555
Your family seems to collect them.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.599
I'll do it.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.792
Take five minutes, wash your face,
come back, no one will know any better.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.557
Loxley, we weren't expecting you.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.830
Mr Barratt, Mr Lowe.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.311
As shareholders we thought we'd see
for ourselves what's being done for us.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.956
Is Selfridges selling cars now?

35:48.640 --> 35:49.959
It's just a talking point.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.715
Once the imagination is moved,
the hand automatically goes in the purse.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.472
"Win a flight in a plane."

35:55.760 --> 35:57.034
More expense?

35:57.280 --> 36:00.875
- The flight is a gift.
- From my son-in-law's business partner.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.510
Oh, family and business, never too far apart.

36:05.600 --> 36:09.513
And all proceeds from the raffle
go towards the Selfridge estate?

36:09.600 --> 36:10.749
Mmm.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.873
Forgive my ignorance, but you have to
explain to me how this works

36:14.040 --> 36:15.519
in business terms.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.913
And a hundred hampers you're giving away?

36:21.160 --> 36:23.754
Er, Britain at Play, it's just the first step.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.673
You'll see the next one soon enough.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.073
Oh, then we can expect profits
and dividends to soar.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.309
Well...

36:31.400 --> 36:33.118
Thank you, Selfridge,
that's enough.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.272
May I ask what is the next step?

36:49.480 --> 36:51.072
Something we've never done before.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.551
It's bold, aggressive.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.199
I'll need your advice.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.079
Mr Crabb.

37:07.360 --> 37:11.239
Sorry to trouble you,
might you still have those magazines?

37:11.520 --> 37:12.748
For the female help?

37:13.800 --> 37:15.870
Yes. Yes, I'll get them now.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.032
Er, thank you!

37:23.120 --> 37:26.556
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.
The raffle draw!

37:26.920 --> 37:29.434
Who will win a flight with <i>Vicomte</i> de Sibour?

37:46.440 --> 37:47.839
Here we go.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.638
And the lucky winner is...

37:53.800 --> 37:55.392
Violette Selfridge!

37:59.520 --> 38:01.158
Go on, they want a photograph!

38:07.880 --> 38:10.155
Thank you, but I can't accept.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.594
Please draw again.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.194
My word is final.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.033
I insist.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.834
Very well.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.477
Then my flight with you will be a gift.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.998
Promise me you will accept.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.154
I promise.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.319
Good.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.553
You draw.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.389
I'm sorry.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.678
Polly... Polly is a nice girl, really, when...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.149
When you get to know her.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.468
And how would I do that?

38:58.200 --> 39:00.395
At a regatta or a charity luncheon?

39:00.840 --> 39:03.354
Or would she come around to my room
and have pilchards on toast,

39:03.480 --> 39:04.674
sitting on my bed?

39:05.480 --> 39:07.755
This'll never work, you and me.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.592
I'll tell my father about us.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.474
All right?

39:20.960 --> 39:22.279
Take you home, meet my family.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.153
I've already met them.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.158
I'm the girl who sells them hats.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.200
I'm sorry, it's over.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.312
This has to stop.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.752
But, Grace...

39:49.520 --> 39:50.953
I'd like to speak to George Towler.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.832
Yes, of course. Please come in.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.513
Thank you.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.995
George, Mr Grove is here to see you.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.712
- Good evening, George.
- Mr Grove.

40:20.440 --> 40:21.793
I, erm...

40:22.760 --> 40:25.672
I've made arrangements
for all my children to return home.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.113
Whatever the difficulties, they...

40:29.480 --> 40:30.674
...belong with me.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.514
What about Ernest?

40:37.760 --> 40:39.557
He is not to blame for his mother's sins.

40:40.880 --> 40:44.395
I want him to come home to his family.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.510
- I'll get him ready.
- Thank you.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.115
I can't believe I was about to
give up on all of this.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.390
And now

41:09.480 --> 41:11.391
you have Regan eating out of your hand.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.159
Thank you.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.313
For what?

41:18.240 --> 41:19.753
For sticking by me.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.148
What are we playing?

41:27.480 --> 41:28.879
You tell me.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.952
I thought you might be out.
Sergei and Rosalie have gone to the theatre.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.517
With Jacques? No, thanks.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.872
Rosalie is trying to pair us up.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.592
Hmm. Would that be so bad?

41:46.920 --> 41:48.399
No, I forgot,

41:48.800 --> 41:50.950
I'm the damaged goods
that no one else wants!

41:51.240 --> 41:53.470
I should be grateful that any man
would look at me.

41:53.600 --> 41:57.070
I can't even hold down a job
so I really should focus on getting married.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.229
What job?

41:58.920 --> 42:01.912
Nancy sent me a note,
thanking me for my hard work.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.439
I'm no longer needed.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.716
- When?
- Yesterday.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.793
Not that it was a real job,

42:07.880 --> 42:09.757
working for my father's mistress.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.079
She's not my mistress.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.198
Could have fooled me.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.635
Nancy means a lot more to me than that.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.673
Well, I hope you told her.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.957
You used to have quite a reputation.

42:22.360 --> 42:24.271
She must know. Everyone else does.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.954
I know that you've been very hurt by Victor,
but you will get over him.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.359
No, I won't.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.153
Because I'm not giving up on him.

42:32.240 --> 42:35.391
When you love someone,
you don't just walk away.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.432
- Mr Grove.
- He's only just woken up. God bless him.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.478
Daddy!

43:00.360 --> 43:01.509
Come on, then.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.238
Oh! Ah!

43:07.040 --> 43:08.837
There we go.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.598
Nancy!

43:19.840 --> 43:21.751
- Look...
- I need to talk to you.

43:22.240 --> 43:25.152
Harry, I've said everything there is to say.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.629
Well, I haven't, so please just hear me out.

43:29.840 --> 43:33.355
This hasn't been some casual affair for me.

43:33.440 --> 43:34.953
Look, you barely know me.

43:35.200 --> 43:38.317
It's been a whirlwind romance,
but I've learned so much about you.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.520
You're not always as strong
as you pretend to be.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.517
When you're unhappy, you hide it.

43:44.600 --> 43:47.751
And if I knew you better, I'd know why.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.797
I need to show you
how much you mean to me.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.149
What...

44:03.440 --> 44:05.078
Nancy, will you marry me?

44:09.080 --> 44:10.308
Yes.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.829
Yes, I will.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.239
I will!

44:21.360 --> 44:22.588
Mmm.
