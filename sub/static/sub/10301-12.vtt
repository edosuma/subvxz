01:31.840 --> 01:33.910
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:44.600 --> 01:45.999
Give me a Jack and a beer back.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.077
All right, out of here.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.793
Come on.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.913
You know the rules.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.635
The elf bar's right down
the street by the cop bar.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.835
You Santas stink.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.871
Next Santa that talks down to me...

02:03.080 --> 02:06.152
...is gonna be
" Ho, ho, ho-ing" in soprano.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.628
Hey, who left
the ornament on the floor?

02:31.800 --> 02:34.633
He's a high little kicker, huh?

02:34.880 --> 02:36.108
- Hey, Bundy.
- Hey, Bundy.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.880
Iskowitz. Gates. Braunstein.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.311
- How's it going over at your mall?
- Well, I've been peed on...

02:42.520 --> 02:44.397
...spit on, snotted on...

02:44.600 --> 02:47.876
...drooled on and thrown up on,
and now it's Miller time.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.915
Give me a beer.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.350
Here's to the death
of Christmas forever.

03:01.760 --> 03:02.829
Who are they?

03:03.760 --> 03:08.117
Street-corner charity Santas.
They think they're better than us.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.754
They're doing it out of goodness.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.039
If you do good for others,
you are repaid tenfold.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.034
- Why, you son of a-
- Hey.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.870
Easy, big guy. It's not your fault.
He goaded you.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.832
It's just this damn Christmas
has got me down.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.917
Nobody cares what we want.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.355
Anybody want me?

03:34.320 --> 03:37.596
<i>Well, I was gonna go see
Aladdin, but...</i>

03:39.400 --> 03:42.312
Now, there's a guy
with Christmas spirit.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.478
You know, nothing makes you
feel like a kid again at Christmas...

03:45.680 --> 03:48.513
...like opening a two-pack of hooters.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.509
I'm gonna have a great time
with the extra money.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.314
I gotta buy gifts for the family.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.757
I used to have a foolproof
system for Christmas.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.952
I invented it in 1974.

04:19.279 --> 04:22.431
Hey, look, is that Daddy?

04:23.120 --> 04:26.874
No. He won't be anybody's daddy.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.069
Okay, kids, Daddy will be home
any second with our Christmas gifts.

04:39.280 --> 04:43.114
He said if we were good,
we'd get gifts. And we've been good.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.754
As far as he knows.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.633
Now, little Bud, what would
you like for Christmas?

04:49.280 --> 04:52.192
<i>Playboys, hooters.
Playboys, hooters.</i>

04:54.000 --> 04:56.309
His first words.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.748
How about you, Kelly?

04:57.960 --> 05:00.872
Well, I want
peroxide and high heels...

05:01.080 --> 05:05.278
...and a " Dy-no-mite
Jimmie JJ Walker" doll.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.114
<i>Playboys. Hooters.</i>

05:07.320 --> 05:08.878
Munchkin. Bed wetter.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.877
Oh, now, now...

05:11.080 --> 05:14.390
Honey, it's okay.
Those are the only words he knows.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.637
Like hell.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.636
Now, how about you, little Buck?
What would you like for Christmas?

05:24.040 --> 05:27.077
<i>I want that little chuck wagon
to run through the house...</i>

05:27.280 --> 05:29.271
<i>...and put food in my bowl.</i>

05:30.240 --> 05:32.800
I sure hope Daddy hasn't spent
all our Christmas money...

05:33.000 --> 05:37.357
- ... on new brakes for the car.
- Look out. No brakes. No brakes.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.391
- Daddy's home.
- Presents.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.079
- Presents.
- Hooters.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.158
- Presents. Presents.
- Hooters. Hooters.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.438
Oh, good. Marriage has yet
shrunk me another inch.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.513
There's not much left
to spare, honey.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.069
This is the last year
I'm working in a shoe store.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.759
A fat woman
came into the store today.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.752
Wanted some shoes
for a Christmas party.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.520
Told her to stand on her hands,
put a star on her butt...

06:29.720 --> 06:32.393
...and go as the world's
largest, ugliest tree.

06:32.600 --> 06:37.196
Then she has the nerve
to get mad at me because she's fat.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.556
- Daddy?
- What?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.672
I forgot.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.509
Oh, yeah. Daddy?

06:49.720 --> 06:51.119
What?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.831
I forgot again.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.195
Don't say "what" next time.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.636
- Okay, pumpkin.
- Okay.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.432
Daddy?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.438
Daddy?

07:12.920 --> 07:14.797
Daddy?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.358
What?

07:18.560 --> 07:20.437
Now you made me forget again.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.554
Al, do you wanna see
our Christmas lists?

07:27.680 --> 07:29.272
Oh, yeah- Christmas.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.438
Well, you know,
I don't have much money.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.551
What with all that damn dog eats.

07:37.640 --> 07:42.316
But it is Christmas, so...

07:42.520 --> 07:45.193
- ... have you been good?
- Oh, yes, very good. Yes.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.433
Well, that's too bad...

07:48.640 --> 07:51.916
...because my present money situation-
Well, I could probably get...

07:52.120 --> 07:54.793
...some, you know, crummy gifts...

07:55.000 --> 07:58.390
...or one of you could get
one really nice gift.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.154
You know, the kids really don't
like you anymore.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.351
You know, the kids hate you.

08:05.320 --> 08:08.312
It seems like none of you
have been very good.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.158
Hooters?

08:13.040 --> 08:14.393
<i>Playboys.</i>

08:15.560 --> 08:18.632
<i>- Playboys?
- Hooters.</i>

08:20.480 --> 08:23.153
Nah, not this year. Maybe next year.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.033
- If you're good.
- Daddy?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.149
What good is this gonna do,
you're just gonna forget.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.438
No, I won't.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.868
Daddy?

08:39.799 --> 08:41.472
What?

08:47.880 --> 08:49.279
It was perfect.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.951
It worked every year,
until two weeks ago.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.277
So every year that Daddy
has any money at all...

08:57.480 --> 08:59.550
...he gets us to turn on each other.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.352
Then we don't get any presents.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.039
What are we gonna say
this year...

09:03.240 --> 09:05.515
...when he tries to get us
to snitch on each other?

09:05.760 --> 09:07.751
- Bud was bad.
- Kelly was bad.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.996
- Let's tell on Mom.
- Kids, please.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.952
Come on. Now, kids...

09:12.200 --> 09:15.795
Now it's happening again.
We're turning on each other already.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.831
That's why this year I have a plan.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.510
For the two weeks before Christmas,
we are family.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.159
And who's the enemy?

09:23.360 --> 09:25.191
Daddy!

09:26.600 --> 09:29.239
That's right.
Now, what do we want for Christmas?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.271
- A CD player.
- Toys.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.879
A new watch.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.509
<i>Playboys, hooters.
Playboys, hooters.</i>

09:40.400 --> 09:43.312
Look out. No brakes. No brakes.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.311
Daddy's home.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.828
This is the last year
I work at the shoe store.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.109
A fat woman
came in the store today...

10:06.320 --> 10:08.675
...said she wanted some shoes
for a Christmas party.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.440
Told her to stand on her hands,
put a star on her butt...

10:11.640 --> 10:14.029
...and go as the world's
largest, ugliest tree.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.511
Daddy, you told us that one already.
It happened 18 years ago.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.753
No, it didn't, it happened today.
I think.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.589
Oh, my God. I'm telling the same
stories over and over again like-

10:25.800 --> 10:28.997
<i>Like Shelley Winters
on The Tonight Show.</i>

10:29.200 --> 10:30.952
I've gotta get out of
the shoe business.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.668
Yeah, Dad. Senile around
with someone who cares.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.110
We got our Christmas lists ready.

10:36.360 --> 10:41.036
Oh, Christmas. Well, you know,
I don't have too much money.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.437
Well, I could probably get
a bunch of crummy gifts for you...

10:44.640 --> 10:48.428
...or one of you could have
one really nice gift.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.272
Oh, a united Bundy front, eh?

10:56.480 --> 10:58.118
Well, I've got bad news for you.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.039
You can't outsmart Daddy
because I'm broke.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.312
Rather than see your disappointed
faces on Christmas morning...

11:04.520 --> 11:06.590
...Daddy will be at the nudie bar.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.432
Now...

11:11.640 --> 11:14.279
...who wants to get old Dad a beer?

11:14.520 --> 11:17.193
Honey, you'll have plenty
of money for gifts this Christmas.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.073
We're gonna help you out.
We all got jobs.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.031
You all got jobs?

11:24.960 --> 11:27.349
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.552
You got jobs? Well, what kind
of jobs did you get for yourselves?

11:31.720 --> 11:34.075
No. Not for us.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.350
For you.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.600
- Let's tell him, kids.
- Okay.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.949
<i>With twelve days till Christmas
Your family got for you</i>

11:45.160 --> 11:47.720
<i>- Twelve days fruit picking
- Eleven, off-ramp selling</i>

11:47.920 --> 11:50.309
<i>- Ten, toilets cleaning
- Nine, digging graves</i>

11:50.520 --> 11:52.988
<i>- Eight, snaking sewers
- Seven, spearing rats</i>

11:53.200 --> 11:57.512
<i>- Six, training guard dogs
- Five, giving blood</i>

11:57.760 --> 12:00.433
<i>- Four, crash-test dummying
- Three jobs roach killing</i>

12:00.640 --> 12:07.193
<i>- Two jobs dog catching
- And one job Santa-ing at the mall</i>

12:11.000 --> 12:13.833
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.834
No, no, no.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.670
Get him off of me.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.110
Get him off of me.

12:56.200 --> 13:00.432
What's he want a pony for anyway,
to put between two slices of bread?

13:01.920 --> 13:03.433
Next.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.830
What do you want
for Christmas, little boy?

13:09.080 --> 13:12.550
Well, I want an end to pollution.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.591
Let's start here.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.917
Always remember
that Santa hates you.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.233
Yeah? What's he gonna do?

13:24.440 --> 13:26.908
Make me a shoe salesman?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.592
Next.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.190
What would you like
for Christmas, little girl?

13:36.440 --> 13:40.319
A husband to yell at and torture.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.669
Well, I'm sure you'll get one.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.877
What would you like for Christmas?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.111
A cure for the measles.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.439
Next.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.157
Hi, Santa.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.791
Did one of your reindeer
make a no-no?

14:06.480 --> 14:11.076
I'm sorry. That must be
the Ghost of Foot Fungus Past.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.033
You don't have to tell Santa
what you want for Christmas.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.390
You want a pair of breasts.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.154
Just like a grown-up woman.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.158
But Santa says,
" Be happy with what you've got.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.511
The body of a young boy. "

14:31.960 --> 14:36.158
Here, little girl, have a candy cane.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.398
You giving out replicas now, Al?

14:39.600 --> 14:41.716
Well, in that case...

14:46.680 --> 14:48.159
Marcie?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.998
I'm sorry, young fella.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.599
Marcie?

14:59.600 --> 15:02.160
Sorry. Thought you were my wife.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.673
Excuse me, son.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.677
Hey, Marcie.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.271
Good, I've been looking
all over for you.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.438
I found a store that carries
that pump-up bra you wanted.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.915
Now you can pump them up
to be any size you want...

15:17.120 --> 15:19.475
...and you won't have to take
Al's insults any more.

15:19.680 --> 15:24.071
And the only one who will know
they're not real is you.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.797
And me.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.598
And me.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.154
Look, Marcie, it's Al.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.270
Oh, God. I'm glad I didn't say anything
that would embarrass me.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.755
Oh, hey. I won't say nothing.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.428
But I'd build her arms up first.
From what I can see...

15:45.640 --> 15:48.632
...she needs to do a lot of pumping.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.513
Hey, move the little boy.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.597
Yeah, we're waiting.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.273
Hey, kids. Santa gives us so much...

16:00.480 --> 16:02.789
...what say we give him
something back?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.831
Yeah!

16:05.320 --> 16:07.117
<i>And a-one, and a-two, and:</i>

16:07.320 --> 16:10.198
<i>Bundy the no man</i>

16:10.440 --> 16:13.079
<i>He's as bald as he can be</i>

16:13.400 --> 16:16.358
<i>With hair in his nose
And rot on his toes</i>

16:16.560 --> 16:18.710
<i>He's as bald as he can be</i>

16:18.920 --> 16:20.148
Just the boys.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.152
<i>Bundy the no man</i>

16:22.360 --> 16:25.238
<i>- Just the girls.
- He's as bald as he can be</i>

16:25.440 --> 16:27.396
<i>- Everyone.
- He's entered old age</i>

16:27.600 --> 16:28.794
<i>Making minimum wage</i>

16:29.000 --> 16:30.956
<i>He's as bald as he can be</i>

16:31.160 --> 16:32.388
And around.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.828
<i>Bundy the</i>

16:34.040 --> 16:35.268
<i>- No man
- Bundy the</i>

16:35.480 --> 16:36.799

- Bundy the</i>

16:37.000 --> 16:38.274
<i>- No man
- Bundy the</i>

16:38.480 --> 16:39.754
<i>- No man
- Bundy the</i>

16:39.960 --> 16:42.269
<i>Bundy...</i>

16:42.480 --> 16:45.392
So I did the 12 jobs in 12 days.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.552
The worst was
the crummy Santa gig.

16:48.760 --> 16:52.639
I had so many knees in my groin,
I thought I was in bed with the wife.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.840
You better give me one more
for the road and then I'm...

16:57.040 --> 16:59.110
I'm off to buy presents.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.594
I'd get you for my son, Bud...

17:03.800 --> 17:06.268
...but he wouldn't know
what to do with you.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.433
" Bud. "

17:16.960 --> 17:18.358
" Peg. "

17:21.160 --> 17:22.593
"Seven. "

17:26.079 --> 17:27.637
" Kelly. "

17:31.200 --> 17:33.794
Ah, now, Buck, boy...

17:34.200 --> 17:36.589
I forgot all about you.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.196
Ah, but you're just
a dumb little dog.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.039
You probably don't
even know it's Christmas.

17:42.240 --> 17:45.789
<i>That's okay.
I have a little something for you.</i>

17:46.000 --> 17:49.549
<i>It's called pee,
and it'll be waiting in your slippers.</i>

17:51.360 --> 17:53.396
Yes, sirree, boy.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.670
It's gonna be one fine Christmas.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.274
I told you I smelled Daddy.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.350
- Presents, you guys, we got presents.
- Presents!

18:03.560 --> 18:06.472
- Presents!
- Look. Look. Look. It's me. Kelly.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.636
It's me.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.353
Oh, Al. You got me
the watch I always wanted.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.599
Daddy, a CD player, and my first CD.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.439
" Herman's Hermits. "

18:21.640 --> 18:26.270
<i>" I Am Henry the V-I-I-I One Am. "</i>

18:27.920 --> 18:31.515
<i>Kel, that's, " I'm Henry Vlll, I Am. "</i>

18:31.720 --> 18:35.315
Now, how could you possibly
get that from that bunch of letters?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.428
Oh, Dad...

18:38.640 --> 18:41.279
A " Build Your Own Hooters" kit.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.478
With the lifelike plastic.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.312
" Build them, look at them...

18:51.520 --> 18:53.715
...feel them, trade them
with your friends.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.798
Or put them on
and just scare your mother. "

18:58.320 --> 18:59.833
God, did I need these.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.555
Look, Mom. Hooters! Hooters!

19:03.760 --> 19:06.558
Yes, they're very cute, dear. Here.

19:06.760 --> 19:11.754
All right. Now, who's the best daddy
in the world?

19:11.960 --> 19:14.952
Daddy!

19:15.160 --> 19:17.276
Then it was all worth it.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.153
It was all worth it.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.234
It was all worth it.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.631
Wake up, buddy. It's closing time.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.438
I was dreaming.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.870
I gave my son breasts.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.319
That's a very cool dream, sir.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.118
Well...

19:40.880 --> 19:42.871
- ... how much I owe you?
- Nothing.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.479
You already paid.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.398
For everybody.

19:46.600 --> 19:50.275
You were unconscious,
but I felt you wanted to pay.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.914
You being Santa and all.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.516
And now, " Ray"...

20:07.080 --> 20:08.832
...can we talk?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.358
Where's Daddy with our presents?

20:12.560 --> 20:15.120
Look out. No brakes. No brakes.

20:19.440 --> 20:23.718
You know, he hit pretty hard. I hope
nothing happened to our presents.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.353
- Oh, presents.
- Presents?

20:29.560 --> 20:31.312
Presents.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.636
Here's Santa with your presents.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.310
Let's see, now. What do we got here?
Bud. Son.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.431
This is for you.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.320
- " Ray's Bar"?
- Just take it and go away.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.239
Now, let's see. Seven.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.477
Here. Your very first beer steins.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.713
Wow, much cooler than a bike.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.872
- All right. Now, pumpkin.
- Is this for me? Is this for me?

20:58.080 --> 20:59.672
What do we have in here for you?

20:59.880 --> 21:01.632
Here you are, sweetie pie.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.638
Now, there you go.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.517
Now, sweetheart, you never have to
learn how to read.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.751
Even comes with
its own wall. Cool.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.476
Best of all, it's a Ray's.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.516
Ah, now, Buck, boy,
I forgot about you.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.392
But you're just a dumb dog.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.556
You probably don't even know
it's Christmas.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.230
<i>And you don't know about
the dead bird I left in your jack et.</i>

21:35.720 --> 21:37.233
Peg.

21:37.440 --> 21:41.558
Try as I might, I couldn't
forget about you.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.069
Oh, Al...

21:48.320 --> 21:51.357
I can't believe it.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.953
But, honey, it says " Ray. "

21:56.200 --> 21:59.317
Well, sure, honey.
That's because you're my little...

21:59.920 --> 22:02.229
...ray of sunshine.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.120
Oh, Al.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.038
Oh, Ray.
