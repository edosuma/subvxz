our questions.

nervous lately?

00:32.466 --> 00:34.299
Do you know what
"nervous" means?

Of course I know what
"nervous" means.

It means afraid.
What do we have to be afraid of?

someone special?

She said she'd be back

She reminded me
where the money was

to use the bathroom.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.346
But I didn't mind.

It didn't bother me, okay?

The defendant is Dwight Darnell.

Mark: Mama's friends say
the police want to keep us down,

02:56.343 --> 02:57.843

02:57.845 --> 02:59.978
There's nothing worse
than a race traitor.

Our race is more important

Barry:
Ava was helping me connect
Dwight to something bigger.

Bigger than killing six adults
and two kids under 10?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.791
As awful as it sounds, yes.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.394
Darnell was affiliated
with a group

03:15.396 --> 03:17.396
called the Zyklon Brotherhood.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.530
The "Zy" what?

Zyklon, as in Zyklon-B,

chambers during the Holocaust.

they're foreign,

white people.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.011
Who taught you
to talk this way?

Ava'd been hanging around with
this gang for about a year,

claimed she knew a lot of people
in the Z-Brotherhood,

03:38.152 --> 03:41.253
said they had used her in some
sort of real-estate fraud,

03:41.255 --> 03:43.422
but she wouldn't name names

Dwight to Zyklon

in any way until I could prove

03:47.861 --> 03:51.096
that she and her son would be
protected, which I did.

03:51.098 --> 03:54.833

I was happy when we left.

This is -- It's a tragedy.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.360
We agree,

04:21.362 --> 04:24.863
is something that I take
very personally.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.267
But does Ava's death
really hurt your case

04:28.269 --> 04:29.968
against Dwight Darnell?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.403
For the murders, no.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.904
But without Ava,

04:32.906 --> 04:34.873
connecting Zyklon to Dwight
is impossible.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.709
The Brotherhood inspired
these killings.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.046
If we don't stop them,
worse things could happen.

04:41.048 --> 04:45.317
Look, before we rush down
this path with D.D.A. Rosen,

she was essentially
living in her car

04:47.855 --> 04:49.321
on the streets for weeks.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.690
Do we have any evidence
she was murdered

04:51.692 --> 04:53.992
specifically
for being a witness?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.627
She was shot in the mouth.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.729
It indicates someone thought
she was a snitch.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.032
But her body was found
in Lincoln Heights,

05:00.034 --> 05:01.967
not exactly Aryan territory.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.603
Well, that's not where
she was murdered, Chief.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.071
According to Kendall,

05:06.073 --> 05:08.340
that lot was just a dumping
place for her body.

Does Ava have
any other family

that we should notify
besides Mark?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.714

Before Mark was born,
she was heavily trafficked.

I tried to get in touch
with her parents,

there quite some time.

I'm surprised the kid wasn't
even more traumatized.

06:05.065 --> 06:08.433

camped out in a car before.

-Yes.

to further delay the court
with [Scoffs] irrelevant --

24:46.552 --> 24:48.686
It is most definitely relevant,
Your Honor,

24:48.688 --> 24:51.021
as it demonstrates a pattern
by which Mr. Darnell

24:51.023 --> 24:53.123
selected and gained access
to his victims.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.360

Mr. Darnell's association

24:56.362 --> 24:57.862
with a known terrorist group.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.897

participation in the conspiracy
