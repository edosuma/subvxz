00:03.361 --> 00:04.662
BILL:
"Tonight,

00:04.796 --> 00:07.199
"I propose
the first-ever national effort

00:07.365 --> 00:09.334
"to reduce class size

00:09.467 --> 00:11.269
in the early grades."

00:11.369 --> 00:13.305
-(mimics cheering) "Thank you."
-(knocking)

00:15.373 --> 00:16.441
Thank you.

00:16.541 --> 00:17.842
(inhales, exhales)

00:17.975 --> 00:19.444
We all set?

00:19.544 --> 00:22.647
Would you like to go over
the list of women one more time?

00:23.881 --> 00:25.983
You're a great lawyer, Bob.
(exhales)

00:26.884 --> 00:27.952
Don't worry.

00:28.052 --> 00:29.854
I'm ready.

00:29.987 --> 00:31.055
Okay.

00:34.559 --> 00:36.561
*

00:45.503 --> 00:47.572
*

01:07.759 --> 01:08.926
(indistinct chatter)

01:09.927 --> 01:11.563
Now, remember
what we talked about.

01:11.696 --> 01:12.930
I can't go in there with you,

01:13.097 --> 01:14.566
but I will be right outside.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.700
(door opens)

01:16.768 --> 01:18.270
Paula?

01:18.436 --> 01:19.437
They're ready for us.

01:21.273 --> 01:22.407
-(exhales)
-To think

01:22.540 --> 01:25.009
that a little woman like you

01:25.109 --> 01:27.445
can sit across
from the president

01:27.612 --> 01:30.282
-of the United States...
-(exhales)

01:30.448 --> 01:32.417
...look him in the eye

01:32.550 --> 01:34.118
and get justice.

01:34.286 --> 01:36.120
(exhales)

01:50.402 --> 01:52.937
(clears throat)

01:53.070 --> 01:54.906
-(Fisher clears throat)
-(quiet chatter)

02:01.078 --> 02:02.480
(exhales)

02:03.481 --> 02:05.817
-(clears throat, sniffs)
-(muffled chatter)

02:17.495 --> 02:18.996
(doors close)

02:19.163 --> 02:20.665
BILL:
Your Honor,

02:20.832 --> 02:23.301
thanks for coming all the way
from Arkansas.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.836
-Did you have a good flight?
-I did.

02:25.002 --> 02:26.504
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:26.671 --> 02:28.806
I appreciate you all
making yourselves available

02:28.940 --> 02:30.675
on the weekend.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.190
COURT REPORTER:
William Jefferson Clinton,

02:46.358 --> 02:48.326
do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

02:48.460 --> 02:50.828
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.997
I do.

02:53.130 --> 02:55.367
Mr. Fisher, floor is yours.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.335
Thank you, Your Honor.
(grunts)

02:57.469 --> 02:59.371
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Good morning.

02:59.537 --> 03:00.705
My name is Jim Fisher, sir,

03:00.872 --> 03:02.340
and I'm an attorney
from Dallas, Texas,

03:02.474 --> 03:04.342
and I represent the plaintiff,
Paula Jones, in this case.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.344
Do you understand
that your testimony today

03:06.478 --> 03:07.945
is subject
to the penalty of perjury?

03:08.045 --> 03:09.447
I do.

03:09.547 --> 03:11.783
Good.
Then I would like to start

03:11.883 --> 03:14.118
by defining a term.

03:14.218 --> 03:17.555
And that term
is "sexual relations."

03:21.893 --> 03:24.796
The definition was taken from
the Violence Against Women Act.

03:24.896 --> 03:26.230
The president might remember
that he signed it into law

03:26.398 --> 03:27.231
this past year.

03:27.399 --> 03:29.233
I thought it looked familiar.

03:29.401 --> 03:31.803
So you understand
the definition, Mr. President?

03:31.903 --> 03:33.471
Yes, I do.

03:33.571 --> 03:35.873
(inhales)
Now, you are aware,

03:36.007 --> 03:37.975
are you not, of the allegations
made against you

03:38.075 --> 03:39.711
by Paula Jones in this lawsuit?

03:39.844 --> 03:41.413
Yes, sir.
I'm aware.

03:41.579 --> 03:43.648
(inhales)
Mr. President,

03:43.748 --> 03:46.150
did you ever make any sexual
advances towards Paula Jones?

03:46.250 --> 03:48.152
No, I did not.

03:48.252 --> 03:49.987
Did you ever expose yourself
to Paula Jones?

03:50.087 --> 03:51.423
No, I did not.

03:51.589 --> 03:53.925
Did you ever ask Paula Jones
to kiss your penis?

03:54.091 --> 03:55.760
No, I did not.

03:55.927 --> 03:58.330
So you deny her testimony that,
in the Excelsior Hotel,

03:58.430 --> 03:59.664
while you were governor
of Arkansas,

03:59.764 --> 04:01.899
you asked her
to perform oral sex on you.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.068
I emphatically deny it.

04:04.201 --> 04:05.603
It did not happen.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.439
FISHER:
Mr. President,

04:07.605 --> 04:09.106
you realize seated to my right,

04:09.273 --> 04:11.208
two chairs down,
is Mrs. Paula Jones.

04:12.276 --> 04:13.578
Do you remember meeting
Miss Jones?

04:13.711 --> 04:14.746
No.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.581
FISHER:
Have you ever met Paula Jones?

04:16.714 --> 04:19.617
I've said this many times.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.886
I have never met Paula Jones.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.088
I'm sorry.

04:24.221 --> 04:25.357
Excuse me.

04:25.457 --> 04:27.224
(cries, sniffles)

04:30.962 --> 04:31.863
(door closes)

04:31.963 --> 04:33.097
(crying)

04:33.230 --> 04:34.131
-That chickenshit!
-Shh.

04:34.298 --> 04:36.267
-He lied! He's lyin'!
-Shh. Shh.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.470
-(crying)
-Shh. Okay.

04:38.636 --> 04:40.372
Oh... (exhales)

04:40.472 --> 04:42.206
Okay.
(sniffles)

04:42.306 --> 04:44.642
-(exhales)
-Ah.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.214
FISHER:
Are you familiar with a woman

04:50.314 --> 04:52.450
-named Kathleen Willey?
-I am.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.452
So you're aware
that Mrs. Willey has testified

04:54.586 --> 04:56.287
that you sexually harassed her
while she was working

04:56.421 --> 04:57.389
as a volunteer
in the White House?

04:57.489 --> 04:59.290
BILL:
I'm aware of that.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.625
FISHER:
Did you place Mrs. Willey's hand

05:00.758 --> 05:02.460
on your penis
and kiss her on the lips

05:02.594 --> 05:04.161
in the private hallway
off the Oval Office?

05:04.328 --> 05:05.296
Mr. Fisher,

05:05.430 --> 05:06.998
in my lifetime,

05:07.164 --> 05:10.001
I have never sexually harassed
a woman.

05:12.003 --> 05:12.970
FISHER:
Mr. President,

05:13.104 --> 05:14.305
do you know a woman

05:14.439 --> 05:15.673
named Monica Lewinsky?

05:16.674 --> 05:17.742
I do.

05:17.842 --> 05:19.644
-How did you come to know her?
-She...

05:19.777 --> 05:22.146
worked at the White House
for a while,

05:22.279 --> 05:24.516
first as an intern
and then in the, uh,

05:24.682 --> 05:26.083
Legislative Affairs Office.

05:26.183 --> 05:27.819
At any time,

05:27.952 --> 05:30.154
were you and Monica Lewinsky
together alone

05:30.287 --> 05:31.322
in the Oval Office?

05:31.456 --> 05:34.325
Your Honor.
Excuse me, Mr. President.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.827
I'm gonna object
to the innuendo.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.329
Counsel is fully aware
that Ms. Lewinsky

05:38.463 --> 05:41.499
has an affidavit,
which they are in possession of,

05:41.633 --> 05:44.936
saying that there is
absolutely no sex of any kind

05:45.036 --> 05:46.538
in any manner, shape or form

05:46.704 --> 05:48.005
-with the president.
-(Fisher clears throat)

05:48.139 --> 05:49.173
Overruled.

05:49.306 --> 05:51.175
The witness
must answer the question.

05:51.308 --> 05:52.710
FISHER:
Mr. President, were you

05:52.877 --> 05:55.680
and Monica Lewinsky ever alone
together in the Oval Office?

05:55.813 --> 05:57.281
I don't recall.

05:57.381 --> 06:01.886
But, uh, when she worked in
the Legislative Affairs Office,

06:02.053 --> 06:04.689
they always had somebody there
on the weekends.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.859
Uh, typically,
I-I worked some on the weekends.

06:07.992 --> 06:11.362
Sometimes they-they'd bring me
things on the weekends.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.364
I-It seems to me that
she-she brought things to me

06:13.498 --> 06:15.967
once or twice on the weekends.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.301
And in that case, you know,

06:17.401 --> 06:19.136
wh-whatever time
she would be in there,

06:19.236 --> 06:21.639
drop it off,
exchange a few words and go.

06:21.739 --> 06:24.075
Have you ever given any gifts
to Monica Lewinsky?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.210
I don't recall.

06:26.343 --> 06:27.211
You know what they were?

06:27.344 --> 06:28.680
A hatpin.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.716
I don't... I don't remember.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.318
A book by Walt Whitman.

06:34.418 --> 06:36.988
(stammers)
You know, that...

06:37.088 --> 06:39.591
-I give people a lot of gifts.
-(exhales)

06:39.757 --> 06:40.925
You know? And, uh...

06:41.092 --> 06:43.227
And-and, you know,
when people are around,

06:43.360 --> 06:46.263
I-I give a lot of things I have
at the White House away.

06:46.430 --> 06:48.165
So, you know,
I could have given her a gift.

06:48.265 --> 06:51.068
Uh... I-I just don't remember
a specific gift.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.104
Has Monica Lewinsky
ever given you any gifts?

06:53.270 --> 06:54.739
Once or twice.
Uh...

06:54.872 --> 06:56.908
I-I think
she's given me a-a book or two.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.176
Has she ever given you a tie?

06:59.276 --> 07:02.446
I get given a lot of ties.
(chuckles softly)

07:05.950 --> 07:08.085
I believe
she has given me a tie, yes.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.021
Mr. President,
it's my understanding

07:10.121 --> 07:12.624
that Monica Lewinsky
has made statements to people,

07:12.790 --> 07:15.259
-and I'd like for you to...
-Uh, objection
to the form of the question.

07:15.392 --> 07:17.428
Counsel shouldn't testify.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.096
I will sustain the objection.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.898
(Fisher clears throat)

07:22.800 --> 07:23.801
Did you have an extramarital

07:23.968 --> 07:25.603
sexual affair
with Monica Lewinsky?

07:25.737 --> 07:26.804
No.

07:26.971 --> 07:28.940
If she told someone that she had

07:29.073 --> 07:30.808
a sexual affair with you
beginning in...

07:30.975 --> 07:33.545
November of 1995,
would that be a lie?

07:33.645 --> 07:35.212
It's certainly not the truth.

07:35.312 --> 07:37.549
It would not be the truth.

07:37.649 --> 07:40.718
I have never had sexual
relations with Monica Lewinsky.

07:40.818 --> 07:42.486
I've never had an affair
with her.

07:43.988 --> 07:46.390
Just so the record is clear,

07:46.490 --> 07:47.959
at any time,

07:48.092 --> 07:50.562
have you and Monica Lewinsky
been alone together

07:50.662 --> 07:52.564
in any room of the White House?

07:52.664 --> 07:54.966
(stammers)
Mr. Fisher, let me...

07:55.099 --> 07:57.468
-(exhales)
-Is-is there something...

07:57.602 --> 07:59.470
You asked that
with such conviction.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.305
I answered with such conviction.

08:01.438 --> 08:03.641
Is there something
you want to ask me about this?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.309
'Cause I don't...
I don't even know

08:05.442 --> 08:06.844
what you're talking about,
I don't think.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.149
Sir, I think
this will come to light shortly

08:12.283 --> 08:13.685
and you'll understand.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.925
You were great, Mr. President.

08:21.025 --> 08:24.962
After today, I bet Judge Wright
throws the whole thing out.

08:27.198 --> 08:29.300
*

08:36.974 --> 08:38.976
(door closes)

09:01.899 --> 09:04.001
*

09:14.078 --> 09:16.080
*

09:22.586 --> 09:24.722
GINSBURG:
So, how are you ladies

09:24.856 --> 09:26.490
-holding up?
-Monica was certain

09:26.590 --> 09:29.093
that the FBI was going to break
down the door at any second

09:29.260 --> 09:30.762
-and arrest her.
-Listen, dear,

09:30.928 --> 09:31.996
that's not gonna happen.

09:32.096 --> 09:34.265
What would happen
is they might call me

09:34.431 --> 09:36.901
and I could arrange it so that
you could turn yourself in.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.436
Would I really go to prison
for 28 years?

09:39.603 --> 09:41.773
Listen, I've never heard
of anybody facing charges

09:41.939 --> 09:43.074
on a false affidavit

09:43.207 --> 09:44.942
-in a sexual harassment suit.
-See?

09:45.109 --> 09:46.944
-(exhales)
-GINSBURG: But they are
federal prosecutors.

09:47.111 --> 09:49.346
I mean, they can jail anybody
for anything.

09:49.446 --> 09:50.782
And Ken Starr is a madman.

09:50.948 --> 09:52.750
He's been holding
a Whitewater witness

09:52.884 --> 09:54.852
in solitary since '96
all because

09:54.952 --> 09:56.287
she won't tell him
exactly what he wants to hear.

09:56.453 --> 09:57.955
Susan McDougal.

09:58.122 --> 09:59.957
-But she's a criminal, right?
-No,

10:00.124 --> 10:01.759
she's just a woman. You know,
a friend of the Clintons.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.461
Well, a friend of one
of the Clintons in particular,

10:04.628 --> 10:07.098
-if you understand
what I'm saying.
-I can't go to prison. I can't.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.199
Listen to me.
You're not gonna go

10:08.299 --> 10:09.701
to prison, okay?
We have a meeting

10:09.801 --> 10:12.436
scheduled tomorrow
with Starr and his goons.

10:12.569 --> 10:14.105
I'm gonna get you your immunity
in writing,

10:14.238 --> 10:15.272
and then that's it.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.441
You're completely free
and clear, okay?

10:17.574 --> 10:19.610
(inhales)
Okay.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.478
Um, before we go and sign,

10:21.645 --> 10:23.948
I-I would really love
to call Betty Currie.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.282
Her and the president deserve
to know what's going on.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.650
Absolutely not.
You cannot do that.

10:26.818 --> 10:28.219
Starr would pull the deal.

10:28.319 --> 10:29.821
I thought maybe I could use
the pay phone in the lobby

10:29.987 --> 10:31.288
-so they wouldn't know
it was me.
-Listen to me,

10:31.422 --> 10:32.456
you're not calling anybody.

10:32.589 --> 10:34.125
No friends, no family,

10:34.258 --> 10:35.626
-no one.
-Why can't I call my friends
and family?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.796
Anybody that you talk to
is gonna get a subpoena.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.564
You've got to cut them off
for their own good.

10:40.664 --> 10:42.566
Monica will do what they want.

10:42.666 --> 10:45.136
Anything you say.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.670
GINSBURG:
Listen, I'm going to fix this.

10:46.838 --> 10:47.805
You understand?

10:47.939 --> 10:48.973
This is what I do.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.474
I thought
you did medical malpractice.

10:50.607 --> 10:52.309
It's more or less
the same thing.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.579
We're gonna get a good deal.
They need you.

10:55.679 --> 10:56.647
And this is the sweet spot,

10:56.781 --> 10:58.182
now, before the press

10:58.349 --> 10:59.817
-gets ahold of the story.
-Press?

10:59.951 --> 11:00.985
Yeah, the press.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.955
When is that gonna happen?

11:05.022 --> 11:06.257
Isikoff,

11:06.357 --> 11:08.259
this is gonna make the planet
explode.

11:08.359 --> 11:10.494
-(chuckles softly)
-How did you get this scoop?

11:10.627 --> 11:13.464
-Hey. Ann wants to see you
in her office.
-(exhales)

11:17.802 --> 11:19.270
Pete's proofing
that latest draft,

11:19.370 --> 11:21.773
so we'll all be set
to go to print tomorrow.

11:21.873 --> 11:24.275
We're holding
on the Lewinsky story, Mike.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.709
I'm sorry?

11:25.877 --> 11:29.380
I must have misheard you
or I'm having a stroke?

11:30.481 --> 11:31.983
(sighs)

11:33.885 --> 11:35.787
We can't print it now.

11:35.887 --> 11:37.454
New York thinks it's too risky.

11:37.554 --> 11:38.722
What if Lewinsky's
not telling the truth?

11:38.890 --> 11:40.291
We know she's telling the truth.

11:40.391 --> 11:41.959
-Yeah, that's not good enough.
-Of course it is.

11:42.059 --> 11:45.129
You're asking the most respected
newsmagazine in America

11:45.229 --> 11:47.731
to say the president
is having an affair

11:47.899 --> 11:48.866
and then lied about it
under oath.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.868
And your only real source

11:51.002 --> 11:52.736
is one girl's voice on a tape,

11:52.904 --> 11:55.539
a girl we haven't
even actually spoken to.

11:55.672 --> 11:57.208
We need more sourcing.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.976
And then we'll go for it
in our next issue.

11:59.076 --> 12:02.980
This story
is gonna break in 24 hours.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.550
Call New York and tell them
we can't fucking wait.

12:06.683 --> 12:08.719
If you could, for just once in
your life, refrain from acting

12:08.853 --> 12:11.422
-like your...
-We have our own Watergate.

12:11.588 --> 12:14.992
We can break it, tomorrow.

12:15.092 --> 12:17.261
Sometimes it's just not worth
being first.

12:21.765 --> 12:23.200
(scoffs)

12:38.115 --> 12:41.418
I thought we cut those out
for good, Mr. President.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.287
(crinkling)

12:43.454 --> 12:45.122
Do you have a moment to talk?

12:52.063 --> 12:54.631
Please, sit down.

12:56.067 --> 12:59.470
How's your mother's health
holding up?

12:59.636 --> 13:01.272
Oh, she's fine.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.940
It's been a rough year,

13:03.074 --> 13:04.775
uh, but we're optimistic.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.445
Good. Your mom need anything,
you tell me, all right?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.614
Thank you, sir.

13:10.747 --> 13:11.983
(crinkling)

13:12.149 --> 13:14.618
Listen, Betty, um...
(exhales)

13:14.751 --> 13:16.954
something came up
during my deposition

13:17.088 --> 13:19.490
that I wanted
to talk to you about.

13:20.491 --> 13:23.660
The lawyers were asking
some strange questions.

13:24.996 --> 13:26.430
Questions about Monica.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.834
I was hoping that you could,
uh...

13:31.002 --> 13:32.669
refresh my memory
on a few things.

13:33.770 --> 13:35.506
I can try, certainly.

13:37.174 --> 13:39.276
As far as you recall...

13:40.511 --> 13:42.646
...you were always with me
and Monica

13:42.779 --> 13:44.015
when she came to visit, right?

13:46.350 --> 13:47.451
That's right.

13:47.584 --> 13:50.521
So Monica and I
were never alone together.

13:52.289 --> 13:55.159
-No, sir.
-But she was... (exhales)

13:55.292 --> 13:56.493
interested in me.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.495
How do you mean?

13:58.629 --> 14:00.164
Well, this is awkward.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.167
Um, I apologize.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.701
I mean sexually.

14:06.303 --> 14:09.306
You know, Monica came on to me
and, uh...

14:10.474 --> 14:12.009
...she wanted to sleep with me.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.844
Right?

14:13.978 --> 14:14.979
Yes, sir.

14:16.213 --> 14:18.149
But nothing happened.

14:19.216 --> 14:20.551
Because that would be wrong.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.687
-That would be wrong.
-Good.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.389
(crunching, sucking)

14:25.556 --> 14:28.559
I'm glad we both have
the same recollection.

14:30.561 --> 14:31.662
Thank you.

14:37.401 --> 14:39.303
-Betty?
-Yes, Mr. President.

14:39.403 --> 14:44.075
Would you mind checking in
on Monica before you head out?

14:44.241 --> 14:46.077
I'd like to know
how she's doing.

14:46.243 --> 14:47.711
I can do that for you.

14:47.844 --> 14:49.513
(door opens)

14:51.748 --> 14:53.384
(door closes)

14:53.517 --> 14:56.920
(phone ringing)

14:59.923 --> 15:00.992
Hello?

15:01.092 --> 15:02.426
Hi.
Is Isikoff there?

15:02.593 --> 15:04.361
This is Matt Drudge.
It's urgent.

15:05.429 --> 15:07.431
I'll see if he's still awake.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.202
It's Drudge.

15:13.604 --> 15:16.507
(inhales, exhales)

15:16.607 --> 15:18.109
He's already gone to bed.

15:18.275 --> 15:19.576
Right.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.245
Well, if you could kindly relay,

15:21.378 --> 15:22.446
I'm looking for a comment

15:22.613 --> 15:25.249
n a piece I'm posting tomorrowo
irst thing.f

15:25.382 --> 15:27.251
It's on Newsweek
spiking his story

15:27.384 --> 15:30.254
on the president's affair
with an intern.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.255
I'll let him know.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.689
Thank you much.

15:32.789 --> 15:34.625
-(clicks)
-NEWSWOMAN: It was the day

15:34.791 --> 15:36.927
the president hoped
never would come.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.929
To shield him
from public embarrassment,

15:39.063 --> 15:42.266
Mr. Clinton was driven the two
blocks to his lawyer's office

15:42.399 --> 15:44.801
and then disappeared
into an underground garage.

15:44.968 --> 15:46.437
Mr. Clinton's accus...

15:46.570 --> 15:48.772
(buzzing)

15:48.905 --> 15:52.443
-...wading through the mob
hoping for pictures.
-It's Betty again.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.545
...the moment
she had been waiting for.

15:54.645 --> 15:56.980
The face-to-face meeting
took place in an...

16:02.586 --> 16:03.720
(quietly):
What does she want?

16:03.820 --> 16:05.556
She clearly wants me
to call her.

16:05.656 --> 16:06.790
I mean, it says "emergency."

16:06.923 --> 16:08.092
Bill must know.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.627
-Give it to me.
-(exhales)

16:10.761 --> 16:12.129
No, she's
just gonna keep paging me.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.830
Monica.

16:19.836 --> 16:20.971
(door opens)

16:21.105 --> 16:23.774
*

16:26.777 --> 16:28.145
You can't let them know
you're scared.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.513
This is a negotiation.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.115
(dings)

16:33.517 --> 16:34.818
You must be Bill Ginsburg.

16:34.951 --> 16:37.654
Yeah. Where can I put my client
so we can talk shop?

16:37.788 --> 16:38.655
I'll take care of her.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.292
*

16:48.299 --> 16:49.866
GINSBURG:
Go ahead, sweetheart.

16:50.033 --> 16:52.035
*

17:01.145 --> 17:03.480
How long have you lived in D.C.?

17:04.981 --> 17:06.183
Two years.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.452
Do you like it here?

17:08.552 --> 17:09.886
No.

17:10.053 --> 17:12.123
GINBSBURG: You are out
of your fucking minds!

17:12.223 --> 17:14.491
You asshole Nazis!

17:17.661 --> 17:20.997
Negotiations can get
pretty heated sometimes.

17:22.999 --> 17:26.370
You know, I went to your friend
Linda Tripp's house.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.472
She makes really good cookies.

17:28.572 --> 17:29.540
(door opens)

17:29.673 --> 17:31.975
We're leaving.
Now.

17:32.075 --> 17:34.178
(breathing heavily)

17:36.079 --> 17:37.714
Did you get the deal?

17:37.848 --> 17:39.483
GINSBURG:
They're lunatics here.
They're the fucking Gestapo.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.752
-MONICA:
Okay, but did I get immunity?
-Not even close.

17:42.753 --> 17:44.087
In the first place,
they threatened to investigate

17:44.255 --> 17:45.922
-your entire family.
-What?

17:46.089 --> 17:47.924
And then they upped their price.

17:48.091 --> 17:49.926
They want to know
every single thing that you know

17:50.093 --> 17:51.262
before they're willing
to even consider

17:51.428 --> 17:53.096
putting anything on paper.

17:53.264 --> 17:54.565
Would I have to make calls?

17:54.698 --> 17:56.667
There are no calls.

17:56.767 --> 17:58.001
There's no nothing.

17:58.101 --> 17:59.736
(paper rustling)

17:59.870 --> 18:01.605
This just came on live.

18:01.772 --> 18:03.274
It's called the Drudge Report.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.675
If you attempt
to call Clinton now,

18:04.775 --> 18:06.677
he's gonna suspect
that you're wired.

18:06.777 --> 18:08.712
You're radioactive.

18:10.281 --> 18:11.915
Come on.

18:12.048 --> 18:14.050
(indistinct voices on TV)

18:27.231 --> 18:29.065
(exhales)

18:31.067 --> 18:33.069
(TV playing indistinctly)

18:34.137 --> 18:36.139
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.210
Uh, seriously?

18:39.310 --> 18:40.311
Where's your brother?

18:40.477 --> 18:42.112
How should I know?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.113
Ryan?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.581
I need to speak with you.

18:49.085 --> 18:50.120
Ryan.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.657
Please, sit down.

18:55.091 --> 18:57.994
We're at the precipice
of a change.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.299
Very soon, the country is going
to discover something

19:02.433 --> 19:03.467
about a friend of mine.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.135
-Monica?
-Yes.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.136
What did she do?

19:06.270 --> 19:07.638
It's not important.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.106
What matters is
that you prepare yourselves.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.844
A lot of people are going to be
saying a lot of things about me.

19:14.010 --> 19:15.612
Some may be nasty.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.283
But others
are going to cheer me on.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.954
They may call me a hero.
(chuckles softly)

19:26.290 --> 19:28.124
Do you know who John Dean is?

19:29.125 --> 19:31.027
Well,

19:31.194 --> 19:35.165
he was, uh, President Nixon's
chief White House counsel.

19:35.299 --> 19:38.335
He was accused
of turning on the president

19:38.469 --> 19:44.007
because he dared to stand up
to the crimes he witnessed

19:44.140 --> 19:45.809
day in and day out.

19:47.210 --> 19:50.113
He risked everything
to defend this country,

19:50.213 --> 19:53.684
and there were people
who pilloried him for it.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.486
But he did the right thing.

19:58.054 --> 20:01.024
I want you to know...

20:01.157 --> 20:03.226
I did the right thing.

20:11.067 --> 20:13.069
*

20:43.033 --> 20:44.267
(door opens)

20:56.613 --> 20:58.248
(exhales)

20:58.382 --> 21:00.551
(clock ticking)

21:15.399 --> 21:17.067
Hillary.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.473
Hillary, wake up.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.108
What?
What's wrong?

21:25.241 --> 21:26.877
Starr's new gambit.

21:26.977 --> 21:29.212
(exhales)
He's expanding

21:29.312 --> 21:32.949
his investigation
into the Paula Jones fiasco.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.718
What?
I don't-I don't understand.

21:34.818 --> 21:36.620
Oh, it's nuts.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.122
This time, he's saying
I had an affair with an intern

21:39.255 --> 21:42.626
and then I asked her
to commit perjury.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.962
Oh, and on top of that, I had
Vernon set her up with a job.

21:46.096 --> 21:49.232
I mean, th-this girl was
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers

21:49.332 --> 21:52.302
and filed an affidavit saying
nothing happened.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.337
Starr has obviously gotten
to her and...

21:54.505 --> 21:56.139
convinced her
to change her story.

21:56.272 --> 21:58.008
(stammers)
Who is she?

21:58.174 --> 22:00.477
Her name is Monica Lewinsky.

22:00.611 --> 22:01.512
Do you know her?

22:01.678 --> 22:03.113
Yeah, I know Monica.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.082
Sh-She worked in the West Wing,

22:06.182 --> 22:07.851
and now she works
in the Pentagon.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.856
Is there something
you need to tell me?

22:13.023 --> 22:14.458
No.

22:16.627 --> 22:17.861
Did something happen?

22:18.028 --> 22:19.863
No.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.667
Because if anything happened,

22:23.800 --> 22:25.168
you know it's better that I w...

22:25.301 --> 22:26.336
And I would tell you.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.338
You know I would.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.306
But nothing happened.

22:31.875 --> 22:34.678
Look, I-I met her
a-and a bunch of other interns

22:34.811 --> 22:36.480
during the shutdown.

22:37.448 --> 22:40.517
You know,
she-she was a sweet kid.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.218
You know, kind of goofy.

22:42.385 --> 22:45.822
You know, she-she came to see me
once or twice for advice.

22:47.891 --> 22:49.560
Turns out
she was kind of troubled.

22:50.894 --> 22:53.229
Nancy and Evelyn, they-they
moved her out of the West Wing

22:53.396 --> 22:56.299
as soon as they saw
how she was behaving.

22:56.399 --> 23:00.571
I... I don't think I was
ever even alone with the girl.

23:01.905 --> 23:02.973
You can ask Betty.

23:03.073 --> 23:04.240
She saw the whole thing.

23:07.243 --> 23:09.345

23:12.082 --> 23:14.017
Okay.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.920
-Did you tell the staff?
-Not yet.

23:17.087 --> 23:19.255
I wanted to get your take
on things first.

23:19.422 --> 23:20.991
Okay, well, you have
to go down there right now.

23:21.091 --> 23:22.258
This is going to explode.

23:22.425 --> 23:23.660
We-we have to act.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.596
You're right.

23:25.762 --> 23:28.098
I'll be down in a minute.

23:33.770 --> 23:34.771
I'm sorry.

This whole mess.

Go tell them.

you lock the doors.

in her conversations with you?

25:25.716 --> 25:27.050
I have no comment.
I'm sorry.

25:27.217 --> 25:29.052
Did Monica Lewinsky
know you were taping her?

25:29.219 --> 25:31.187
I'm a witness
in a federal investigation.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.689

25:32.823 --> 25:33.890
(clamoring continuing)

And they're just looping
this shit.

25:52.643 --> 25:54.978
They w-they won't even cut
to a commercial.

25:55.078 --> 25:56.647
How bad is it in the press room?

25:56.747 --> 25:58.381
Oh, it's a fucking nightmare.

25:58.514 --> 26:00.817
Sam Donaldson's on my ass.
Baker from the Post,

26:00.917 --> 26:02.318
Bennet from the Times.

26:02.418 --> 26:04.420
You know, it-it's my job
to respond to their questions,

26:04.587 --> 26:06.657
and I have no idea
what I'm supposed to say.

26:06.757 --> 26:08.925
Where is he?

26:09.092 --> 26:10.694
With Hillary.

Uh...

26:14.364 --> 26:16.399
You know, w-we look paralyzed.

26:16.532 --> 26:18.268
We have to respond now

26:18.434 --> 26:20.771
or the only reasonable
conclusion people will come to

26:20.937 --> 26:22.739
is that it's all true.

26:22.873 --> 26:25.742
Do you honestly think he decided
to risk his presidency

26:25.876 --> 26:27.577
on a complex perjury scheme

26:27.711 --> 26:30.513
involving a 24-year-old

26:30.613 --> 26:32.949
-Look, hey. You're close to him.
-Yeah.

26:33.116 --> 26:34.250
He trusts you.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.786
-You have to ask him.
-Ask him what?

26:35.952 --> 26:38.121
Did he fuck this intern?

26:39.389 --> 26:40.857
Mr. President.

26:40.957 --> 26:43.226
I was looking for you two.

26:44.627 --> 26:46.429
Uh, Mr. President, uh,

26:46.562 --> 26:48.098
you have back-to-back meetings
scheduled today.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.701
Jim Lehrer on PBS.
Mara Liasson at NPR.

26:50.801 --> 26:52.268
-Roll Call...
-I'm aware.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.605
Okay. Uh, well, since we're
all still, uh, searching

26:55.739 --> 26:57.941
for a good
comprehensive response to this,

26:58.074 --> 27:00.043
maybe we should cancel those.

27:00.143 --> 27:01.111
(Blumenthal chuckles)

27:01.244 --> 27:02.779
Brilliant idea.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.948
Why don't we issue
a formal admission of guilt

27:05.081 --> 27:06.282
while we're at it?

27:06.416 --> 27:08.451
They're gonna ask
about the girl, sir.

27:08.584 --> 27:11.888
Let 'em ask
whatever the hell they want.

27:11.988 --> 27:14.324
I have nothing to hide.

27:20.596 --> 27:22.833
ABC's Jackie Judd.
She broke the story overnight.

27:22.999 --> 27:24.300
(Monica sighs)

27:24.434 --> 27:26.803
He's gonna have to resign.

27:26.937 --> 27:27.804
It's all my fault.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.973
Don't look at it that way.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.474
What way-- accurately?

27:31.607 --> 27:34.510
This is a terrible week
in our lives,

27:34.677 --> 27:37.580
but all we have to do
is get through it.

27:37.680 --> 27:42.085
And, yes,
maybe he will have to resign.

27:42.185 --> 27:44.420
But, guess what, when he does,

27:44.520 --> 27:46.189
all of this stops.

27:46.356 --> 27:48.191
He goes away,
all of it goes away.

28:59.429 --> 29:01.764
that you suborned perjury

29:01.932 --> 29:03.900
by encouraging
a 24-year-old woman

29:04.034 --> 29:05.401
who you were
having an affair with

29:05.535 --> 29:07.770
to lie under oath.

29:07.938 --> 29:09.906
Mr. President, is that true?

29:10.040 --> 29:14.410
That is not true.
That is not true.

29:14.544 --> 29:18.748
I did not ask anyone to tell
anything other than the truth.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.284
There is
no improper relationship,

29:21.451 --> 29:23.954
and I intend to cooperate
with this inquiry.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.922
But that is not true.

29:26.056 --> 29:28.191
No improper relationship.

29:28.291 --> 29:30.260
Define what you mean by that.

29:30.393 --> 29:31.928
Well, I-I think
you know what it means.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.964
It means that there is not a...

29:34.130 --> 29:35.598
sexual relationship,

29:35.731 --> 29:38.201
an improper sexual relationship.

29:38.301 --> 29:40.636
Or any other kind
of improper relationship.

29:40.803 --> 29:43.306
You had no sexual relationship
with this young woman?

29:43.473 --> 29:45.976
There is not
a sexual relationship.

29:46.142 --> 29:47.210
That is accurate.

29:47.310 --> 29:49.145
You know,
that-that's all I can say now.

29:49.312 --> 29:52.615
You see, what-what I'm trying
to do i-is to contain my...

29:52.748 --> 29:56.152
(chuckles) natural impulses
and-and get back to work.

29:56.319 --> 29:58.821
You know, I-I think it's
important that we cooperate.

29:58.989 --> 30:00.123
I will cooperate.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.792
But-but I want to focus

I did not urge anyone.

30:16.172 --> 30:20.410
I did not urge anyone
to say anything that was untrue.

30:20.510 --> 30:25.248
I did not urge anyone to say
anything that was untrue.

Mm-hmm.

30:29.619 --> 30:30.987

If-if it's-if it's not true,

30:33.689 --> 30:36.026
uh, that means
somebody made this up.

30:36.192 --> 30:39.162
-I-Is that...
-Look, y-you know as much
about this as I do right now.

30:39.295 --> 30:42.032

31:04.988 --> 31:06.189
Did you see that shit?

31:06.322 --> 31:07.623
The right wing
gives them garbage

31:07.723 --> 31:08.959
and they run with it every time.

31:09.059 --> 31:10.793
Even PBS.
It's unreal.

31:10.893 --> 31:12.195
You don't deserve this,
Mr. President.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.696
I hope you know that.

31:13.829 --> 31:15.298
Imagine the apocalypse
in the press room.

31:15.398 --> 31:17.067
-They're eating McCurry alive.
-Yeah,

31:17.233 --> 31:18.701
well, it's his job
to handle that.

31:18.834 --> 31:20.636
I know, Mr. President,
but we do need to offer

31:20.736 --> 31:21.804
a clear explanation.

31:21.904 --> 31:22.905
I've made my comment, Sid.

31:23.073 --> 31:24.640
Yes, but it's just what she said

31:24.740 --> 31:26.809
about you on the tapes, sir.

31:26.909 --> 31:28.078
Tapes?

31:29.745 --> 31:31.747
RATHER:
CBS News White House
Correspondent Scott Pelley

31:31.914 --> 31:32.748

31:32.915 --> 31:34.550
PELLEY:
Dan, these are

31:34.684 --> 31:37.587
the most serious allegations
ever leveled at the president,

31:37.753 --> 31:40.923
essentially perjury
and obstruction of justice.

31:41.091 --> 31:43.093
-What's gonna happen?
-The allegations are contained
in a series

31:43.259 --> 31:45.095
-of secretly recorded
audiotapes.
-He's gonna have to resign.

31:45.261 --> 31:47.563
Lewinsky swore in a deposition

31:47.697 --> 31:50.400
that she never had an affair
with the president.

31:50.533 --> 31:53.436
But that is not what she was
telling coworker Linda Tripp.

31:53.603 --> 31:56.672
Tripp has been recording
conversations

31:56.772 --> 31:58.274
with Lewinsky over the phone.

31:58.441 --> 32:01.277
source familiar with the tapeA
ells CBS Newst

32:01.444 --> 32:04.080

in tears,

32:04.214 --> 32:07.083
leading with Trippp
o help her cover up the affairt

32:07.217 --> 32:09.119
Tripp says
that if she is ever asked

32:09.285 --> 32:11.087
about whether Lewinsky
had an affair,

32:11.221 --> 32:13.289
she would
have to tell the truth.

32:13.456 --> 32:16.126
Lewinsky begs her not to.

32:25.968 --> 32:28.771
He's waiting for you
in his study.

32:28.904 --> 32:31.741
I remember when they used
to let me in the front door.

32:33.576 --> 32:34.777
Dick Morris?

32:34.910 --> 32:37.913
No, no, no, no, no.

32:49.992 --> 32:51.894
(sighs)

32:51.994 --> 32:54.097
You poor son of a bitch.

32:55.598 --> 32:57.133
Thanks for coming.

32:57.267 --> 33:00.070
Well, I'm an expert
at sexual imbroglios.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.504
You know
I didn't want to let you go.

33:01.671 --> 33:03.806
(exhales)
My staff forced my hand.

33:03.939 --> 33:05.241
Your political advisor

33:05.341 --> 33:08.244
got caught sucking
a prostitute's toes.

33:08.344 --> 33:10.246
I'd have told you
to fire me myself.

33:10.346 --> 33:12.315
I messed up with this girl.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.317
-I know.
-No.

33:14.450 --> 33:17.853
No, I fucked this up
beyond all recognition.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.255
I walk in a room,

33:19.355 --> 33:21.324
I don't know what
the next question's gonna be.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.093
I don't know what Starr has.

33:23.193 --> 33:25.261
I don't know
what Monica's saying.

33:25.361 --> 33:28.298
I can't form
any kind of response.

33:29.465 --> 33:30.500
What are people saying?

33:30.633 --> 33:31.701
Honestly,

33:31.867 --> 33:33.269
they're saying
Al Gore better be reading up

33:33.369 --> 33:34.837
on Saddam Hussein

33:34.970 --> 33:37.207
because he's going to be
commander in chief by summer.

33:37.373 --> 33:39.942
I can't be
fucking Richard Nixon.

33:40.042 --> 33:42.345
You know,
everything you work for gone,

33:42.478 --> 33:44.880
shell of yourself
for the rest of your life.

33:46.216 --> 33:49.219
You told me once if,
at the start of Watergate,

33:49.385 --> 33:51.387
he would've manned up
and admitted it,

33:51.554 --> 33:52.855
he would have survived.

33:52.988 --> 33:55.691
So I-I'm thinking
I-I just admit it,

33:55.825 --> 33:57.293
apologize,

33:57.393 --> 33:59.195
kill the story.

33:59.329 --> 34:01.297
But I can't.

34:01.397 --> 34:02.898
Because it would destroy
Hillary.

34:03.065 --> 34:06.236
I think she'd walk out on me.

34:06.402 --> 34:07.570
I don't know what to do.

34:07.737 --> 34:10.240
Well, let me help you with that.

34:15.578 --> 34:17.313
(grunts, inhales)

34:17.413 --> 34:19.715
Small sample,
but it's an RDD poll.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.584
Good quality.

34:27.423 --> 34:30.160
You think I don't know
why you called me

34:30.260 --> 34:33.596
instead of one
of your PC liberals on staff?

34:33.763 --> 34:34.664
You want the truth?

34:34.764 --> 34:35.731
Well, there it is.

34:35.865 --> 34:37.733
The American people know
you're a man.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.902
Hell, most of them
actually like that about you.

34:40.035 --> 34:41.737
If it were just the sex,

34:41.871 --> 34:43.439
they'd forgive it.

34:43.606 --> 34:46.942
But look at the unfavs
on question 17.

34:49.445 --> 34:51.914
It's about what you said
under oath.

34:52.047 --> 34:54.417
Admitting to the affair
is admitting to perjury.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.686
And if you admit to perjury,

34:56.786 --> 34:58.454
you lose all public support,

34:58.621 --> 35:00.423
even among your base.

35:00.556 --> 35:01.624
You'd have to resign.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.194
Take it from me--
being disgraced

35:04.294 --> 35:05.628
isn't as fun as it sounds.

35:10.633 --> 35:12.134
You can't tell the truth.

35:18.641 --> 35:19.909
Well, then it's simple.

35:22.978 --> 35:25.581
We just have to win.

35:31.487 --> 35:32.622
BLUMENTHAL:
Mr. President,

35:32.755 --> 35:34.457
we just need to be able
to explain

35:34.590 --> 35:37.126
why she would go
into such graphic detail

35:37.260 --> 35:39.061
talking about you.

35:39.161 --> 35:41.130
Do you know this person at all?

35:41.264 --> 35:43.666
Look, when Monica worked here,

35:43.833 --> 35:45.468
she was a nice girl.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.303
Hardworking.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.639
But you could tell
she was troubled.

35:49.772 --> 35:52.642
You know?
She comes from a broken home.

35:52.775 --> 35:54.910
I would talk to her on occasion,

35:55.010 --> 35:56.479
give her advice.

35:56.612 --> 35:59.315
(exhales) You know, I was
just trying to help her out.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.285
And I think
she got the wrong idea.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.987
She came on to you?

36:05.120 --> 36:08.258
Well, she started calling Betty
at all hours.

36:08.358 --> 36:11.427
You know, turning up at events
where she knew I'd be.

36:11.527 --> 36:12.862
She got fixated.

36:13.863 --> 36:16.098
You know,
she told me her friends

36:16.198 --> 36:18.834
called her "the stalker."

36:18.968 --> 36:21.170
And she said, you know,
if she and I had sex,

36:21.304 --> 36:23.673
then they couldn't
call her that anymore.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.008
(exhales)
Jesus.

36:26.141 --> 36:28.010
Did you tell anyone?

36:28.143 --> 36:30.613
When the ladies in the office
saw how she was behaving,

36:30.713 --> 36:31.947
they had her moved.

36:32.047 --> 36:33.616
And that was it.

36:33.716 --> 36:35.951
You know,
I-I can't speak for whatever...

36:36.051 --> 36:39.221
fantasy she may have spun
talking to her friend.

36:39.389 --> 36:40.356
PRODUCER:
We'll lead off the segment

36:40.490 --> 36:41.957

Beverly Hills,

36:42.057 --> 36:44.026
-fat camp,
her parents' divorce papers.
-(door opens)

36:44.159 --> 36:46.061
-Stop. Shut up. Look at this.
-(door closes)

36:46.228 --> 36:48.831
What is this supposed to be?

36:50.833 --> 36:52.167
Roll ahead.

36:53.235 --> 36:54.404
Okay, wait, wait.
Go back.

36:54.570 --> 36:55.738
(whirring)

36:55.905 --> 36:57.172
There.

36:59.842 --> 37:02.478
Look who's waiting
like a little stalker.

37:02.578 --> 37:04.880
REPORTER:
I knew I recognized her.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.382
That hat.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.551
I remember seeing this in '96
and thinking

37:08.684 --> 37:11.921
no one has ever been that happy
to see Bill Clinton.

37:12.087 --> 37:13.389
-MAN: Waterbed.
-MAN 2: Mm, no.

37:13.523 --> 37:14.890
-MAN 3: Waterbed.
-MAN 4: No, I want to do...

37:15.024 --> 37:16.258
-I like the movie.
-Do waterbed.
-All right!

37:16.426 --> 37:18.561
Pitch on the monologue.

37:18.694 --> 37:21.397
Uh, saw a movie today
that got great reviews.

37:21.531 --> 37:22.532
Everybody loved it.

37:22.665 --> 37:25.167
Monica Lewinsky
gave it two legs up.

37:25.267 --> 37:28.571
-Eh.
-A lot coming out about
the Clintons in these lawsuits.

37:28.704 --> 37:31.006
Apparently,
Bill's pet name for Hillary

37:31.106 --> 37:32.942
is "my little buttercup."

37:33.108 --> 37:34.510
His pet name for Monica?

37:34.610 --> 37:36.846
-"My little suction cup."
-(chuckling)

37:36.946 --> 37:39.449
Okay, Ken Starr is very upset

37:39.615 --> 37:41.250
he's not getting
what he wants from Monica.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.786
Apparently, he's the first guy
that's ever happened to.

37:43.953 --> 37:46.288
(laughter)

37:46.456 --> 37:48.924
Bill Clinton can have sex
with any woman alive

37:49.058 --> 37:50.526
and he chooses her.

37:51.627 --> 37:53.929
I mean, that's not a pitch.
That's just a...

37:54.063 --> 37:56.432
-question for the room.

-Is it a federal holiday,
I think?
-(laughs) Probably.

38:05.307 --> 38:06.776
All zippers at half-mast
or something?

38:06.909 --> 38:08.277
-I don't know what happens...

I had an unusual attachment

-That's it.

40:27.617 --> 40:29.284
Enough. We're not gonna
watch this anymore.

40:29.451 --> 40:31.687
What are you doing? That is
my only source of information.

40:31.787 --> 40:33.623
No, it's not.

40:33.789 --> 40:35.190
These are lies
about my daughter,

-They're not lies.

40:37.793 --> 40:40.062
What are you talking about,
Monica?

(clanging)

40:46.401 --> 40:47.269
Monica.

40:47.402 --> 40:49.271
I did have an affair with Bill.

40:49.404 --> 40:51.273
And I did go to fat camp.

40:51.406 --> 40:52.608
And my parents did break up.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.309
And I guess, one night,
I told Linda

40:54.476 --> 40:56.111
that you raised me
in a house of lies,

It doesn't matter.

So many kids have that
exact same history. Come on.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.453
(sighs)
It's all true.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.121
Just like it's true
that everyone I've ever met

41:06.255 --> 41:07.790
is apparently just waiting
for a phone call

41:07.923 --> 41:09.792
from Wolf fucking Blitzer
to just go on live TV

41:09.925 --> 41:10.826
and tear me apart.

41:10.993 --> 41:11.994
-Honey, I know that you don't...
-Please,

41:12.161 --> 41:13.763
don't tell me
that it's gonna be okay.

41:14.764 --> 41:16.231
I messed up so bad

41:16.331 --> 41:17.232
that I can't turn off the TV.

41:17.332 --> 41:19.802
Because if I turn off the TV...

41:19.935 --> 41:21.470
I'm just gonna imagine
the horrible things

41:21.604 --> 41:23.138
that people are saying about me,
and that's worse.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.640
Sweetheart,
let me draw you a bath,

41:24.774 --> 41:26.175
-do something to distract...
-I know you're trying to help,

41:26.341 --> 41:29.411
but, right now, all I can do
is I can just sit here

41:29.511 --> 41:30.980
and I can watch this.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.082
Okay?
That's all.

41:33.182 --> 41:36.318
NEWSMAN:
...seeking all of the records
involving Monica Lewinsky.

41:36.451 --> 41:38.520
Phone records, job records,

41:38.688 --> 41:40.189
-when she entered
the White House...
-(exhales)

41:40.355 --> 41:41.857
-...when she left
the Wh-White House.
-(dialing)

41:42.024 --> 41:43.258
-(line ringing)
-We're told by sources

41:43.358 --> 41:44.660
that she would frequently
come in...

41:44.794 --> 41:46.596
-GINBSURG: Hello?
-Bill?

41:46.696 --> 41:48.831
This has to end right now.

41:48.964 --> 41:50.766
Listen, Marcia,
I'm doing everything I can.

41:50.866 --> 41:52.334
e're close on an immunity dealW

41:52.467 --> 41:54.837
We just need her to say
what she's gonna testify to.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.371
She'll come with me
to the office, and...

41:56.538 --> 41:59.341
No, no, she can't-she can't
go outside.

41:59.474 --> 42:01.711
They'll mob her.
You said that yourself.

42:01.877 --> 42:03.345
-NEWSMAN 2: ...shock America.
-(sobs) Mom.

42:03.478 --> 42:04.546
I'll call you back.

42:04.714 --> 42:06.548
(clamoring)

42:09.384 --> 42:11.186
No! No.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.888
That creep took advantage of you

42:13.055 --> 42:15.958
-when you were young.
-Please, Mom, stop.

42:16.058 --> 42:18.227
-(clamoring)
-(cameras clicking)

42:18.393 --> 42:19.629
When I heard the authorities

42:19.729 --> 42:21.631
were investigating
Monica Lewinsky,

42:21.731 --> 42:23.132
I felt I had to come forward.

42:23.232 --> 42:24.366
I'm sorry.
We're turning this off!

42:24.499 --> 42:26.301
Don't.

42:26.401 --> 42:28.804
-Monica and I were involved
for a time
-I'd rather see it.

42:28.904 --> 42:30.239
before she went
to Washington.

42:30.405 --> 42:32.241
We had an affair.

42:32.407 --> 42:36.578
And while my wife and I
were trying to heal,

42:36.746 --> 42:38.213
onica wouldn't leave us alone.M

42:38.347 --> 42:41.550
She became obsessed with us.

42:41.684 --> 42:45.220
She convinced herself
that we were in love.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.589
How do I put this?

42:47.757 --> 42:51.226
Uh, Monica has a history
of twisting the facts.

42:51.360 --> 42:55.230
REPORTER:
Would you say that this was
a Fatal Attraction scenario?

42:55.364 --> 42:58.834
(Kate chuckles)-
ANDY: Um... you could say that-

42:58.934 --> 43:00.836
REPORTER 2:
What else can you tell us
about Ms. Lewinsky?

43:00.936 --> 43:03.605
ANDY:
There's a lot the world
should know about Monica.

43:03.773 --> 43:05.107
(TV clicks off)

43:17.452 --> 43:19.554
*

43:21.456 --> 43:23.893
We'll walk straight to the car.

43:24.794 --> 43:26.428
And it will be over

43:26.561 --> 43:28.230
before you know it.

43:44.814 --> 43:47.049
Bill, big day.

43:47.149 --> 43:49.284
How are you guys holding up?

43:49.418 --> 43:50.986
Eh...

43:51.153 --> 43:53.488
(muffled chatter)

43:53.655 --> 43:55.124
(muffled shouting)

43:55.257 --> 43:56.726
(man shouts)

43:56.826 --> 43:59.628
(all clamoring)

43:59.762 --> 44:02.464
Okay, all right, we're just
gonna go straight to the car.

44:02.597 --> 44:04.800
-We're not gonna talk to them,
all right?
-GUARD: Get back!

44:04.934 --> 44:06.736
Out of my way!
Excuse me.

44:06.836 --> 44:09.471
Out of our way. Go.
Get in there!

44:09.604 --> 44:11.774
(clamoring continues)

44:13.342 --> 44:14.476
GUARD:
Move! Stay back!

44:14.609 --> 44:15.477
Monica!

44:15.610 --> 44:17.446
(all clamoring)

44:18.848 --> 44:20.449
(siren chirps)

44:30.192 --> 44:31.761
GINSBURG:
So,

44:31.861 --> 44:32.862
we have a deal?

44:35.530 --> 44:36.966
We have a deal.

44:38.133 --> 44:40.502
Judge Starr will sign that
as well,

44:40.635 --> 44:42.805
and we'll fax it back your way.

44:43.873 --> 44:44.974
We're done here.

44:51.546 --> 44:53.482
(inhales)

45:00.055 --> 45:01.891
*

45:05.394 --> 45:07.229
(grunts softly)

45:09.331 --> 45:10.665
(exhales)

45:12.667 --> 45:13.869
Hey.

45:14.003 --> 45:16.138
I know you don't believe me,

45:16.238 --> 45:17.372
but it's all gonna be okay now.

45:17.506 --> 45:20.075
I just want to go to sleep.

45:20.242 --> 45:22.077
Okay, baby.

45:37.592 --> 45:39.829
NCHOR:A
ell, that's gonna do it for usW
e thank you for watching.W

45:39.929 --> 45:42.331
e're back again tomorrow nightW
t 11:00.a

45:42.431 --> 45:44.666
I don't...
Um, should we watch this?

45:44.766 --> 45:47.102
Of course.
Who's gonna play Monica?

45:47.269 --> 45:48.737
I hope they're fair to her.

45:48.871 --> 45:51.440
It'll be her and Bill
in the office.

45:51.606 --> 45:52.774
Oh, stop it.
Shush.

45:52.942 --> 45:55.110
(traffic sounds)

46:00.215 --> 46:02.284
Hi.
I'm meeting a friend here.

46:02.451 --> 46:03.953
-Your name?
-Monica Lewinsky.

46:04.119 --> 46:06.255
-Oh, yes.
-(cheering and applause)

46:06.388 --> 46:08.457
-Right this way.
Ms. Tripp is already here.
-Okay.

46:08.623 --> 46:09.458
Oh, okay.

46:09.624 --> 46:12.061
-Monica.
-(laughter)

46:14.796 --> 46:17.466
-Monica Lewinsky.
-Hi. (giggles)

46:17.632 --> 46:19.434
-Mwah.
-(microphone feedback)

46:19.568 --> 46:20.769
-Okay, you shouldn't watch this.
-LINDA: No, no.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.771
It's funny.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.439
-SHANNON: Oh, thank...
-KATTAN: What can I, uh, get

46:24.573 --> 46:26.308
you two lovely ladies to drink-
GOODMAN: Hmm.-

46:26.475 --> 46:27.877
SHANNON:
Um...

46:27.977 --> 46:29.945
I'll have a Bartles & Jaymes.

46:30.079 --> 46:32.614
I'll have a Bloody Mary
and two AA batteries.

46:32.747 --> 46:34.049
(laughter)

46:34.149 --> 46:36.218
(clapping, whooping)

46:36.318 --> 46:39.821
So, former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky,

46:39.989 --> 46:41.656
hmm,

46:41.823 --> 46:43.425
I enjoyed talking to you la...

46:46.996 --> 46:48.430
(footsteps approaching)

46:55.437 --> 46:57.339
You're still up?

46:57.506 --> 46:59.008
Mm.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.746
Is that the brandy you bought,
like, five years ago

47:04.846 --> 47:06.648
-to make a cake?
-(chuckles)

47:06.781 --> 47:08.783
Brandy doesn't expire.

47:11.686 --> 47:14.156
Are you okay?

47:14.289 --> 47:15.790
Why?

47:16.959 --> 47:18.327
The thing on TV?

47:18.460 --> 47:19.628
Oh.

47:20.529 --> 47:21.964
I'm fine.

47:25.700 --> 47:29.104
You know what the popular kids
used to call me in school?

47:29.204 --> 47:31.140
Mm?

47:32.207 --> 47:33.808
Gus.

47:36.145 --> 47:39.781
It was a running joke
my-my whole junior year.

47:39.881 --> 47:42.451
People would ask me why
and I'd pretend I didn't know,

47:42.551 --> 47:43.986
but I did.

47:45.387 --> 47:47.289
I knew the whole time.

47:48.557 --> 47:52.995
Gus Johnson was
a big famous basketball player.

47:55.064 --> 47:57.166
A gigantic man.

48:00.502 --> 48:01.971
-That's horrible.
-No,

48:02.071 --> 48:04.739
the point is,
I've been teased my whole life.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.509
I can take it.

48:08.743 --> 48:10.412
Doesn't matter.

48:15.350 --> 48:16.585
Allison.

48:21.523 --> 48:23.225
Oh, God, that's disgusting.

48:23.358 --> 48:25.060
-It's basically Robitussin.
-(groans)

48:25.194 --> 48:27.596
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

48:32.934 --> 48:34.036
Love you.

48:35.104 --> 48:35.937
I love you.

48:36.105 --> 48:37.106
It's gonna be okay.

48:37.272 --> 48:38.540
Okay.

48:40.109 --> 48:42.244
RUSSERT:
The attorney for former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky,

48:42.377 --> 48:43.278
William Ginsburg.

48:43.412 --> 48:45.280
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

48:45.447 --> 48:48.583
Does Ken Starr have a case
without your client?

48:48.717 --> 48:50.185
Well... (chuckles)
I'm afraid

48:50.285 --> 48:52.921
you're gonna have to ask
Ken Starr that question.

48:53.055 --> 48:55.424
What Ken Starr
and his prosecutors did

48:55.557 --> 48:56.591
to Monica Lewinsky

48:56.725 --> 48:58.260
is completely unethical.

48:58.393 --> 49:00.962
hey threatened this 24-year-olT
oman with jail time,w

49:01.130 --> 49:03.598
when it is, in fact, they
who should really be concerned

49:03.732 --> 49:05.200
about going to jail.

49:05.300 --> 49:08.103
'm not involved in any sort ofI
ense negotiations whatsoever.t

49:08.237 --> 49:10.772
e're just waiting for KenW
tarr's office to call and makeS

49:10.905 --> 49:13.208
-some sort of an offer, if
indeed they intend to make one.
-(line ringing)

49:13.308 --> 49:14.776
I had a phone call with, uh,

49:14.909 --> 49:17.046
-Ken Starr's office yesterday.
-EMMICK: Judge. Hi.

49:17.146 --> 49:18.947
Never heard from you
on a Sunday before...

49:19.081 --> 49:20.382
Yeah, I came in after worship.

49:20.482 --> 49:22.617
The Lewinsky agreement--
what's the status?

49:22.751 --> 49:24.886
ll good.A
he signed, her counsel signed.S

49:24.986 --> 49:26.555
Have we signed?

49:26.655 --> 49:29.624
Uh, no. I was gonna
have you sign tomorrow.

49:29.758 --> 49:32.327
-I can bring it by now...
-I'm not signing a darn thing.

49:32.494 --> 49:34.329
-What's that?
-I'm not giving her immunity.

49:34.496 --> 49:36.298
-GINSBURG:
...paraded into a courthouse...
-Ginsburg appears to be breaking

49:36.431 --> 49:37.666
the laws of metaphysics,

49:37.832 --> 49:39.468
gloating on every single
Sunday show.

49:39.601 --> 49:41.002
-I know what's he doing.
-...shut down...

49:41.170 --> 49:42.471
He's signaling to the president

49:42.604 --> 49:44.306
that she isn't going
to tell us anything.

49:44.439 --> 49:46.241
EMMICK:
Judge, we gave our word.

49:46.341 --> 49:48.477
-W-We can't go back on...
-I've made up my mind.

49:48.610 --> 49:49.844
No deal.

49:50.011 --> 49:51.413
*

49:51.513 --> 49:53.282
(door opens)

50:09.864 --> 50:12.334
(indistinct chatter in distance)

50:12.467 --> 50:15.637
WOMAN (in distance):
(laughs) That's okay. Bye.

50:18.707 --> 50:20.709
*

50:33.655 --> 50:36.225
It's been five news cycles.

50:36.391 --> 50:37.692
I know.

50:37.826 --> 50:39.528
State of the Union
is Tuesday night.

50:39.661 --> 50:42.297
I spoke to the whole cabinet,

50:42.397 --> 50:44.032
leadership in both houses.

50:44.166 --> 50:45.367
-They have my back.
-Well,

50:45.500 --> 50:47.702
they understand who Starr is
and what he's doing,

50:47.836 --> 50:48.870
but the public doesn't.

50:49.003 --> 50:50.405
We can't rely

50:50.572 --> 50:52.307
on surrogates.
It needs to be you.

50:52.407 --> 50:55.644
The people want to hear
from Bill Clinton.

50:55.744 --> 50:58.147
I mean,
he's in there, somewhere.

50:58.247 --> 50:59.214
I assume.

50:59.348 --> 51:00.349
I hope.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.585
We could lose everything
that we have fought for.

51:03.752 --> 51:06.155
The only way we do this
is we meet it head-on.

51:06.255 --> 51:08.257
You deny it
and you throw it back at Starr

51:08.423 --> 51:09.824
like the garbage it is.

51:09.924 --> 51:11.560
What are my options?

51:11.693 --> 51:13.762
You know,
you-you listen to McCurry,

51:13.928 --> 51:15.764
he wants me to do
a live TV address to the nation.

51:15.930 --> 51:18.500
Okay, that's another
C-plus idea from McCurry.

51:18.600 --> 51:21.336
Who's surprised? We are not
gonna give Starr that power.

51:21.436 --> 51:23.104
So what do we do?

51:23.272 --> 51:26.241
(exhales)
Sid and I have a plan.

51:27.709 --> 51:29.678
NEWSWOMAN:
It was subpoenas from
lawyers for Paula Jones

51:29.778 --> 51:32.914
-that led to all these
revelations about Lewinsky.
-(phone rings)

51:33.047 --> 51:34.916
-Today, Mr. Clinton's lawyer,
Robert Bennett,
-Hello?

51:35.049 --> 51:36.451
argued that Clinton enemies

51:36.618 --> 51:38.953
are using the Jones case
to destroy the president.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.789
What are you talking about?

51:41.890 --> 51:43.292
She signed it.

51:44.226 --> 51:45.627
You signed it.

51:47.229 --> 51:48.563
They can't do this to us.

51:49.564 --> 51:50.799
Why is this happening?

51:50.965 --> 51:52.434
(departing footsteps)

51:52.567 --> 51:54.269
NEWSMAN:
...incredibly sensitive
to public opinion.

51:54.403 --> 51:55.637
As for what you are thinking--

51:55.804 --> 51:57.372
many things, it seems...

51:57.472 --> 51:58.640
BLUMENTHAL:
They're all in there.

51:58.807 --> 52:01.643
You told them
to expect something.

52:01.810 --> 52:03.778
You'll find
a bigger-than-normal crowd

52:03.912 --> 52:05.947
for an event
about after-school programs.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.650
-All right.
-REPORTER: The first lady
is set to host an event

52:08.817 --> 52:09.951
on childcare this morning.

52:10.084 --> 52:11.820
(applause)-
However, we have just been tol-

52:11.986 --> 52:13.822
-that the president
is going to make...
-Mom, get in here.

52:13.988 --> 52:15.557
...a surprise appearance.

52:15.657 --> 52:17.759
(applause continues)

52:24.499 --> 52:25.934
HILLARY:
Thank you.

52:26.835 --> 52:28.069
Thank you.
Good morning.

52:28.169 --> 52:30.272
Welcome to the White House.

52:31.940 --> 52:34.743
I'm especially glad
to see in the audience

52:34.843 --> 52:37.912
so many people who care so much

52:38.012 --> 52:40.582
about education and childcare.

52:40.682 --> 52:44.586
Now, I am very pleased

52:44.686 --> 52:48.923

of working parents

52:49.023 --> 52:53.828

First,

53:07.642 --> 53:10.445

who are here.

53:10.545 --> 53:14.115

together now for...

53:14.215 --> 53:16.285
20 years

53:16.385 --> 53:18.019
on a lot of these issues,

53:18.152 --> 53:20.955
and this is
a very happy day for us.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.225
I thank the first lady
for all she has done

53:24.393 --> 53:26.461
on this issue
for as long as I've known her.

53:26.561 --> 53:27.729
Every child

53:27.862 --> 53:30.131
needs someplace to go
after school.

53:30.231 --> 53:32.467
What's going on?
Is he about to resign?

53:32.567 --> 53:34.969

to help Americans succeed

53:35.069 --> 53:37.572

-What is he up to?

53:37.739 --> 53:40.575

53:40.742 --> 53:43.812

in the toughest job of all,

53:43.912 --> 53:45.747
that of being a parent.

53:45.914 --> 53:49.584
nd the Mott Foundation has gonA
long way toward helping us.a

53:49.751 --> 53:50.919

53:53.522 --> 53:56.057
I have to go back to work
on my...

53:56.190 --> 53:58.560
State of the Union speech.

53:58.693 --> 54:02.531
And, uh, I worked on it
till pretty late last night.

54:03.432 --> 54:05.834
But I want to say one thing
to the American people.

54:05.934 --> 54:07.936
I want you to listen to me.

54:08.102 --> 54:10.204

ith that woman,w

54:17.446 --> 54:19.548
Ms. Lewinsky.

54:21.049 --> 54:23.418

54:23.552 --> 54:25.253
Not a single time.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.921
Never.

54:27.055 --> 54:30.091
These allegations are false.

54:30.224 --> 54:34.596
And I need to go back to work
for the American people.

54:34.729 --> 54:36.064
