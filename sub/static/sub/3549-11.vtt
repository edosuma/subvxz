WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:05.005
DO YOU DO WEDDINGS?
 OH, MY GOODNESS.
ARE YOU TWO...

00:05.005 --> 00:07.038
YES.
YES, WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

00:07.038 --> 00:09.040
OH, MY GOD! WOW.
 CONGRATULATIONS.

00:09.040 --> 00:13.114
THOSE IN LOVE MADE
THE NEXT STEP... OR TRIED TO.
 I NEED MORE FROM YOU.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.216
(crying) GABY, I CAN SEE THEM.
 THAT'S WONDERFUL! OH!

00:15.216 --> 00:18.649
EYES WERE OPENED
IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE...
 THE KEY IS THIS DOCTOR GUY.

00:18.649 --> 00:22.393
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST BITE
THE BULLET AND GO TO BOSTON.

00:22.393 --> 00:26.297
YOU BREAK UP MY FAMILY.
YOU BURN DOWN MY BUSINESS.
 I DIDN'T BURN DOWN YOUR CLUB.

00:26.297 --> 00:28.329
AND A THREAT WAS MADE.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.262
SOMEDAY, YOU'LL BE
WALKING HOME FROM SCHOOL,

00:31.262 --> 00:33.264
AND YOU'LL JUST DISAPPEAR.
POOF!

00:37.508 --> 00:39.510
(Mary Alice)
THERE ARE IMPORTANT EVENTS

00:39.510 --> 00:43.114
IN THE HISTORY
OF EVERY FAMILY...

00:43.114 --> 00:46.377
JOYOUS BIRTHS...

00:46.377 --> 00:49.620
TRAGIC DEATHS...

00:49.620 --> 00:52.683
SUBLIME WEDDINGS.

00:52.683 --> 00:56.487
BUT THE ONE EVENT
EVERY FAMILY DREADS

00:56.487 --> 00:58.829
IS THE MOMENT
WHEN THEY FINALLY MEET...

00:58.829 --> 01:00.691
THE IN-LAWS.

01:00.691 --> 01:04.334
MOM, THIS IS ALEX'S MOM
MELINA COMINIS.

01:04.334 --> 01:06.637
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

01:06.637 --> 01:09.140
LIKEWISE, AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR LETTING ME STAY HERE.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.342
I JUST CAN'T AFFORD
A MOTEL RIGHT NOW.

01:11.342 --> 01:14.345
(chuckles)
 OH, ALEX MENTIONED THAT YOU
WERE LAID OFF FROM YOUR JOB.

01:14.345 --> 01:17.178
I'M SO SORRY.
 OH, THAT'S OKAY.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.180
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
IN A BAD ECONOMY,

01:19.180 --> 01:23.584
THE MATURE COCKTAIL WAITRESS
IS THE FIRST TO GO.
 REALLY? THEY SAY THAT?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.586
MOM, WE'RE GONNA
GO GET YOUR LUGGAGE.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.788
THAT WAY, YOU TWO
CAN GET ACQUAINTED.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.290
THANK YOU AGAIN

01:29.290 --> 01:32.092
FOR MAKING THE LONG DRIVE
DOWN FROM OAKDALE.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.666
IT'S HIGH TIME OUR FAMILIES
GOT TOGETHER.

01:35.666 --> 01:37.798
ABSOLUTELY.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.471
NOW SPEAKING OF
FAMILY GET-TOGETHERS,

01:40.471 --> 01:43.404
THAT REMINDS ME--
I CALL CHRISTMAS.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.675
WHAT?

01:44.675 --> 01:46.677
NOW THAT THE BOYS
ARE GETTING HITCHED,

01:46.677 --> 01:49.140
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SPLIT THE HOLIDAYS, SO...

01:49.140 --> 01:51.642
I CALL CHRISTMAS.
 WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

01:51.642 --> 01:55.146
THIS IS NOT HOW WE DECIDE
FAMILY GET-TOGETHERS.
 WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

01:55.146 --> 01:57.418
I'M LETTING YOU HAVE
THANKSGIVING.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.820
I'M A CATERER. I OVERSEE
EVENTS ON THANKSGIVING.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.892
IT'S THE ONE HOLIDAY
THAT I DON'T NEED.

02:01.892 --> 02:03.594
GREAT.
I CALL THANKSGIVING.

02:03.594 --> 02:07.127
STOP THAT! YOU CAN'T CALL
ALL THE MAJOR HOLIDAYS.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.899
NO ONE'S CALLED EASTER YET.
GOING ONCE...

02:08.899 --> 02:11.232
I AM NOT BIDDING
ON TIME WITH MY SON.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.834
GOING TWICE...
 MELINA, THIS IS CHILDISH!

02:13.834 --> 02:16.136
(gasps) OOH! OOH!
MY HAND'S GOING UP.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.169
FINE! I CALL EASTER.

02:18.169 --> 02:20.311
THAT WASN'T SO HARD,
WAS IT?

02:20.311 --> 02:22.673
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

02:22.673 --> 02:25.176
FOR TWO FAMILIES
TO NEGOTIATE THE HOLIDAYS,

02:25.176 --> 02:26.847
BUT I FEEL STRONGLY

02:26.847 --> 02:29.550
THAT THIS IS NOT
THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT,

02:29.550 --> 02:33.424
AND I'M SURE THAT THE BOYS
WOULD AGREE WITH ME.
 HEY...

02:33.424 --> 02:35.926
I CALLED CHRISTMAS
FAIR AND SQUARE,

02:35.926 --> 02:38.429
AND I WANNA SPEND IT
WITH MY SON.

02:38.429 --> 02:41.762
SO IF YOU GO TO THE BOYS
AND TRY AND SCREW ME OVER,

02:41.762 --> 02:45.436
I'LL REMEMBER THAT
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

02:45.436 --> 02:46.897
GOT IT?

02:46.897 --> 02:51.902
YES, THERE ARE IMPORTANT EVENTS
IN THE HISTORY OF EVERY FAMILY.

02:51.902 --> 02:54.305
MEETING THE IN-LAWS IS ONE.

02:54.305 --> 02:57.348
LOOK AT YOU TWO. HAVE I TOLD YOU
HOW GREAT YOU LOOK TOGETHER?

02:57.348 --> 02:59.210
HAVE I?
 AW.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.413
THE MOMENT
YOU DECIDE TO HATE THEM

03:02.413 --> 03:16.497
IS ANOTHER.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.870
THERE'S A HOME
FOR EVERYONE IN SUBURBIA,

03:19.870 --> 03:24.375
AND A REALTOR EAGER TO FIND YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.

03:24.375 --> 03:27.938
WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING
WARM AND COZY...

03:27.938 --> 03:31.812
OR SOMETHING DIGNIFIED
AND ELEGANT...

03:31.812 --> 03:35.946
OR PERHAPS SOMETHING AFFORDABLE
WITH A PORCH.

03:35.946 --> 03:40.721
YES, EVERYONE WANTS A HOME
WITH A LOVELY EXTERIOR,

03:40.721 --> 03:44.795
MOSTLY SO THE NEIGHBORS
WILL NEVER SUSPECT

03:44.795 --> 03:49.229
THE UGLINESS GOING ON INSIDE.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.333
THERE YOU ARE!

03:52.333 --> 03:55.936
I JUST GOT THE LISTING
FOR THE ADAMS HOUSE.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.439
AND I THINK
THE BEST WAY TO CELEBRATE

03:58.439 --> 04:01.472
IS FOR MY SEXY HUSBAND
TO TAKE ME OUT DANCING.

04:01.472 --> 04:04.875
(exhales deeply) OH, BABE.
(chuckles) NOT TONIGHT.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.348
WHAT'S WRONG? ARE YOU SICK?

04:07.348 --> 04:09.350
NO. NO, UH...

04:09.350 --> 04:11.352
I'M GOOD.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.853
REALLY?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.855
'CAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.387
I'M GOOD, EDIE.
I JUST, UH...

04:17.387 --> 04:20.430
I-I JUST... FEEL LIKE
STAYING IN TONIGHT, THAT'S ALL.

04:21.992 --> 04:24.465
AH, YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.467
THERE IS SOMETHING
UPSETTING YOU,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.469
AND INSTEAD
OF LETTING ME HELP YOU,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.471
YOU'RE SHUTTING ME OUT.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.644
I JUST DON'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT MY TROUBLES. (chuckles)

04:33.644 --> 04:35.946
AND I DON'T LIKE
SITTING AT HOME DOING NOTHING

04:35.946 --> 04:38.008
WHEN I FEEL LIKE DANCING.

04:38.008 --> 04:41.812
EDIE...

04:43.554 --> 04:46.687
I AM SORRY YOU'RE UNHAPPY.

04:46.687 --> 04:50.391
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ME.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.963
I DON'T STAY UNHAPPY
FOR LONG.

04:52.963 --> 04:55.796
(breathes heavily)

04:55.796 --> 04:57.628
(beep)

04:57.628 --> 04:59.299
Hey, it's Jackson,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.902
having fun
at the old alma mater.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.574
We need to talk.

05:03.574 --> 05:05.576
Only good news, I promise.

05:05.576 --> 05:07.938
Did I mention I miss you?
Bye.
 (beep)

05:07.938 --> 05:09.910
(Bob) WE MOVED HERE
TO GET AWAY FROM THAT.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.082
(Lee) I DIDN'T.
I MOVED HERE FOR YOU.

05:12.082 --> 05:14.084
I'VE GOT A DEPOSITION
TO PREP FOR.

05:14.084 --> 05:16.417
WELL, THEN I WILL
GO CLUBBING WITHOUT YOU,

05:16.417 --> 05:19.420
AND I WILL BE WEARING MY "NOT
COMING HOME ALONE" JEANS.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.752
BY "WEARING,"
YOU MEAN "SQUEEZING INTO"?

05:21.752 --> 05:24.355
DAMN YOU!

05:33.964 --> 05:36.066
AAH!

05:36.066 --> 05:38.038
MISS ANYTHING?
NEED A JUICY RECAP?

05:38.038 --> 05:41.442
NO. I'M GOOD.
 BOY, YOU JUST
HAVE TO STICK YOUR NOSE

05:41.442 --> 05:42.973
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

05:42.973 --> 05:44.915
I'M SORRY.

05:44.915 --> 05:47.878
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
I HAVE DIRT ON BREE.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.781
GO ON.

05:50.781 --> 05:52.383
AHA!

05:52.383 --> 05:54.385
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN I AM.

05:54.385 --> 05:56.056
NICELY PLAYED, MAYER.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.059
THANK YOU. CAN I GO CLUBBING
WITH YOU TONIGHT?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.061
OVERPLAYED, MAYER.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.733
OH, PLEASE! I'M BORED.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.735
MIKE HAS M.J.,
JACKSON'S OUT OF TOWN,

06:04.735 --> 06:08.138
AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEBODY
TO BITCH ABOUT BOB TO.

06:08.138 --> 06:10.841
YOU DO REALIZE
I'M GOING TO A GAY CLUB.

06:10.841 --> 06:13.474
YES, THAT'S FINE.
GAYS LOVE ME.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.805
NAME THREE.

06:14.805 --> 06:17.007
YOU, BOB, ANDREW.

06:17.007 --> 06:18.148
THAT'S TWO.

06:18.148 --> 06:20.110
COME ON.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.982
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

06:21.982 --> 06:24.114
MEET AT MY HOUSE AT 9:00.

06:24.114 --> 06:26.857
AND YOU MIGHT WANNA
PILE ON THE MAKEUP.

06:26.857 --> 06:29.159
DRAG QUEENS GET
THEIR FIRST DRINK FREE.

06:31.722 --> 06:33.664
OKAY, WELL, LET'S TRY
SOMETHING EASIER.

06:33.664 --> 06:35.666
AFTER YOU LEFT
MR. SCHILLING'S NIGHTCLUB,

06:35.666 --> 06:36.997
WHERE DID YOU GO FIRST?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.999
UH...

06:40.130 --> 06:43.003
I DON'T RECALL.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.405
DID YOU MAYBE
DRIVE SOMEWHERE?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.808
UH...

06:47.808 --> 06:51.081
OKAY, PORTER, WHEN THE D.A.,
WHO ALSO HAS THIS POLICE REPORT,

06:51.081 --> 06:52.943
ASKS YOU THESE QUESTIONS,

06:52.943 --> 06:55.886
AND YOU SUDDENLY "DON'T RECALL"
 ANYTHING YOU SAID,

06:55.886 --> 06:57.187
THAT'S BAD.

06:57.187 --> 07:00.921
BOB, YOU'VE BEEN GOING AT THIS
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.754
(Lynette) WHY DON'T WE
TAKE A BREAK?
 FINE. PORTER, GO AND CHILL.

07:03.754 --> 07:06.126
I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR PARENTS
ANYWAY.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.128
(slaps side)

07:10.731 --> 07:12.663
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

07:12.663 --> 07:14.805
NOTHIN'. YOU KNOW,
PORTER'S JUST NERVOUS.

07:14.805 --> 07:17.137
HE WAS ALSO NERVOUS WHEN I FIRST
INTERVIEWED HIM IN JAIL,

07:17.137 --> 07:19.970
BUT HE WAS STILL ABLE
TO KEEP HIS STORY STRAIGHT.

07:19.970 --> 07:22.212
(Penny) PRESTON!
WHERE'S MY CD PLAYER?!

07:22.212 --> 07:23.814
(Preston) WHAT?

07:23.814 --> 07:25.846
PARKER SAW YOU TAKE IT.

07:25.846 --> 07:29.480
MOM, PLEASE TELL PRESTON
TO STOP TAKING MY STUFF.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.682
HONEY, THAT'S PORTER.

07:31.682 --> 07:33.824
NO, IT ISN'T.

07:33.824 --> 07:35.025
(coughs softly)

07:35.025 --> 07:37.658
OH. RIGHT.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.989
SORRY.

07:44.134 --> 07:47.097
YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANNA TELL ME?

07:48.599 --> 07:50.571
GABY, YOU SHOULD'VE COME.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.903
YOU MISSED A BEAUTIFUL WALK
IN THE PARK.

07:52.903 --> 07:55.776
MOMMY, LOOK AT WHAT WE FOUND!
A LADYBUG!

07:55.776 --> 07:58.008
WOW! NEAT!

07:58.008 --> 08:01.081
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO WASH YOUR HANDS FOR LUNCH?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.514
OH, LOOK AT HER TEENY
BLACK POLKA DOTS.

08:03.514 --> 08:06.517
THERE'S SO MANY BEAUTIFUL THINGS
I USED TO TAKE FOR GRANTED

08:06.517 --> 08:08.519
BEFORE I LOST MY SIGHT.

08:08.519 --> 08:11.091
YEAH, PRETTY.

08:12.863 --> 08:15.165
WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR WORK.

08:15.165 --> 08:17.497
YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

08:17.497 --> 08:19.499
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
BEFORE...

08:19.499 --> 08:20.671
WHAT?

08:20.671 --> 08:22.733
I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE MASSAGES ANYMORE,

08:22.733 --> 08:24.735
SO I QUIT THE COUNTRY CLUB.

08:24.735 --> 08:26.577
YOU QUIT?! WHY?

08:26.577 --> 08:29.139
OKAY, I KNOW THIS IS
GONNA SOUND BAD...

08:29.139 --> 08:32.842
WHEN I WAS BLIND,
I NEVER REALIZED THAT...

08:32.842 --> 08:35.145
NAKED PEOPLE ARE GROSS,
ESPECIALLY THE MIDDLE-AGED SLOBS

08:35.145 --> 08:37.147
THAT BELONG
TO THIS COUNTRY CLUB.

08:37.147 --> 08:39.149
CARLOS, YOU DON'T JUST
QUIT A JOB

08:39.149 --> 08:43.092
BECAUSE OF A FEW MOLES
AND A LITTLE BACK FAT.
 BUT I CAN FIND OTHER WORK.

08:43.092 --> 08:46.697
NOW THAT I HAVE MY VISION BACK,
THE WORLD IS MY OYSTER.

08:46.697 --> 08:49.029
IN THE MEANTIME,

08:49.029 --> 08:52.032
I JUST WANNA SPEND A FEW DAYS
WITH MY DAUGHTERS

08:52.032 --> 08:54.534
AND SMELLING THE ROSES,
SOAKING IN NATURE.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.739
LIKE THAT BEAUTIFUL SPIDER
RIGHT THERE.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.941
GOD'S PERFECT DESIGN.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.613
ISN'T IT AMAZING?

09:02.613 --> 09:05.916
(sighs deeply)
YEAH, IT SURE IS.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.880
I'LL GET YOU THE WANT ADS.

09:11.922 --> 09:14.084
(Orson clears throat)

09:14.084 --> 09:17.087
WHAT'S ALL THIS?
 OH, ANDREW THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE

09:17.087 --> 09:19.089
TO HAVE A FORMAL DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:19.089 --> 09:21.061
WELL, IF IT'S
A FORMAL DINNER,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.163
WHY AREN'T WE USING
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S TABLECLOTH?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.165
FOR MELINA? SHE'D PROBABLY
BLOW HER NOSE ON IT.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.138
NO, I WILL NOT LET THAT WOMAN
DEFILE NANA'S LACE.

09:28.138 --> 09:30.140
I KNOW MELINA
ISN'T WHAT WE HOPED FOR,

09:30.140 --> 09:32.142
BUT LET'S FACE IT--
IN-LAWS RARELY ARE.

09:32.142 --> 09:34.074
NEED I REMIND YOU
OF MY MOTHER?

09:34.074 --> 09:36.076
WELL, AT LEAST GLORIA
HAD THE GOOD TASTE

09:36.076 --> 09:38.078
TO HAVE A PARALYZING STROKE

09:38.078 --> 09:40.150
SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO DEAL WITH HER.

09:40.150 --> 09:42.582
TRUE. THAT WAS
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.585
BUT MELINA APPEARS TO BE
IN TRAGICALLY GOOD HEALTH,

09:45.585 --> 09:47.057
WHICH MEANS WE'VE GOT

09:47.057 --> 09:49.319
QUITE A FEW BEER-DRENCHED
HOLIDAYS AHEAD OF US.

09:49.319 --> 09:52.322
YOU HAVE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
SOME WAY TO BE NICE TO HER.

09:52.322 --> 09:55.796
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE IT IN ME.
SHE'S SUCH A TROGLODYTE.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.127
PLEASE.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.799
NO ONE'S BETTER

09:58.799 --> 10:01.802
AT PLASTERING ON A FAKE SMILE
AND PRETENDING TO LIKE SOMEONE

10:01.802 --> 10:03.333
THAN BREE HODGE.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.335
(steam hisses)
 MMM. YOU'RE SWEET.

THAT'S WHY HE RAN AWAY?

21:15.375 --> 21:19.609
I THOUGHT HE WAS AFRAID
OF GOING TO JAIL.

21:19.609 --> 21:22.752
WELL, I'M SURE WARREN SCHILLING
WAS JUST TRYING TO SCARE HIM.

21:22.752 --> 21:24.984
IT WORKED!
PORTER'S TERRIFIED!

21:24.984 --> 21:27.417
OKAY, WE'LL GET A--WE'LL GET
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

21:27.417 --> 21:31.461
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA
STOP THIS GUY.
 I CAN HANDLE WARREN SCHILLING.

21:31.461 --> 21:33.763
BUT IF PORTER DOESN'T
SHOW UP FOR COURT,

21:33.763 --> 21:37.597
WE'RE GONNA LOSE
OUR RESTAURANT!
 A GUY THREATENS
TO KILL YOUR SON,

21:37.597 --> 21:40.069
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

21:40.069 --> 21:43.373
NO, I'M NOT GONNA LET
MY BROTHER RISK HIS LIFE

21:43.373 --> 21:45.935
SO YOU AND DAD
CAN SELL PIZZA.
 (door slams)

21:45.935 --> 21:48.307
HOW DO YOU SLEEP WITH SOMEONE
AND NOT REMEMBER?

21:48.307 --> 21:51.341
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS DRUNK.

21:51.341 --> 21:54.514
OKAY, LET'S SKIP TO
THE IMPORTANT PART--WHO WAS IT?

21:54.514 --> 21:56.586
JUST A FRIEND.

21:56.586 --> 21:58.748
OH, GABY,

21:58.748 --> 22:00.990
DO YOU THINK
I DID THIS SUBCONSCIOUSLY

22:00.990 --> 22:03.493
JUST TO SABOTAGE
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JACKSON?

22:03.493 --> 22:05.495
IT WAS TOM SCAVO, WASN'T IT?

22:05.495 --> 22:07.357
WILL YOU STOP GUESSING?

22:07.357 --> 22:10.329
OH, GOD! WHY WON'T I JUST
LET MYSELF BE HAPPY?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.101
WAS IT LOU?

22:12.101 --> 22:14.333
MY MECHANIC? ARE YOU CRAZY?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.806
COME ON. YOU WERE WITH
A PLUMBER AND A HOUSEPAINTER.

22:16.806 --> 22:19.439
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT--
YOU LIKE YOUR SERVICE PROVIDERS.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.611
(knock on door)
 SUSAN, YOU HOME?

22:21.611 --> 22:23.112
BOB! UM...

22:23.112 --> 22:25.114
UH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:25.114 --> 22:27.917
WELL... IT'S ABOUT LEE.

22:27.917 --> 22:30.420
HE TOLD ME
HE TOOK YOU OUT LAST NIGHT.

22:30.420 --> 22:35.425
YES. UH, WE HAD A VERY NICE,
UNEVENTFUL EVENING. WHY?

22:36.686 --> 22:38.688
(chuckles nervously)
WHAT DID HE SAY?

22:38.688 --> 22:40.730
'CAUSE HE WAS PRETTY DRUNK,

22:40.730 --> 22:44.093
SO HE WAS...
PROBABLY MAKING STUFF UP.

22:44.093 --> 22:46.666
WELL, HE DIDN'T COME HOME.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.668
HE CLAIMS
HE SPENT THE NIGHT HERE.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.600
(teacup shatters)

22:50.600 --> 22:52.572
OH, MY GOD.

22:52.572 --> 22:57.447
OH, HI, GABY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.
 NEVER MIND HER.
SHE WAS JUST LEAVING.

22:57.447 --> 23:00.450
NO. I THINK I SHOULD STAY
AND CLEAN THIS UP.

23:00.450 --> 23:03.513
IT'S A... (stifles laugh)
HUGE MESS.

23:03.513 --> 23:05.014
UH, BOB...

23:05.014 --> 23:07.487
UH, LEE DID STAY HERE
LAST NIGHT.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.818
(sighs)

23:08.818 --> 23:11.491
HE SLEPT ON THE COUCH...
IN THE GUEST ROOM.

23:11.491 --> 23:15.595
SO YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.
 OH, THANK GOD.
I JUST HAD THIS AWFUL FEELING

23:15.595 --> 23:18.097
THAT HE SPENT THE NIGHT
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.769
(laughs)

23:21.130 --> 23:23.903
LEE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
HE LOVES YOU.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.476
I KNOW HE DOES,

23:26.476 --> 23:28.478
BUT HE'S GOT
A FEW DRINKS IN HIM,

23:28.478 --> 23:31.841
HE'LL BANG ANYTHING
WITH A PULSE AND FACIAL HAIR.

23:31.841 --> 23:36.115
(laughing loudly)

23:38.788 --> 23:41.651
(thud)
 (Gabrielle) OW!

23:41.651 --> 23:44.854
YOU STILL
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM?

23:44.854 --> 23:47.727
FOR THE 17th TIME...

23:47.727 --> 23:49.058
NO.

23:49.058 --> 23:51.801
WHERE DOES SHE GET OFF
HAVING ALL THAT ATTITUDE?

23:51.801 --> 23:54.664
SHE'S YOUNG AND PRETTY,
AND WE'RE NOT.

23:54.664 --> 23:56.135
SHE'S NOT THAT PRETTY.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.437
I CAN HEAR EVERY WORD
YOU'RE SAYING.

23:58.437 --> 24:02.211
FROM ALL THE WAY OVER THERE?
BOY, SHE IS YOUNG. (chuckles)

24:02.211 --> 24:06.015
LOOK, I'M VERY TIRED,
SO I'M GOING TO BREAK THE RULES.

24:06.015 --> 24:08.017
DR. HELLER WENT
ON SOME SORT OF TRIP.

24:08.017 --> 24:10.780
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN BACK
A WEEK AGO,

24:10.780 --> 24:14.624
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

24:14.624 --> 24:17.757
BECAUSE IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS!
 (telephone rings)

24:17.757 --> 24:19.458
(ring)

24:19.458 --> 24:21.761
HELLO? DR. HELLER'S OFFICE.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.664
UH, HEY. IT'S DAVID DASH.
IS HE IN?

24:24.664 --> 24:26.836
DID YOU HEAR THAT? HE SHOULD'VE
BEEN BACK BY NOW.

24:26.836 --> 24:28.467
WHY ISN'T HE BACK?

24:28.467 --> 24:31.240
I'M SORRY, MR. DASH.
DR. HELLER'S OUT OF TOWN.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.242
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU THINK
DAVE HAS SOMETHING TO DO

24:33.242 --> 24:36.005
WITH HELLER BEING LATE
FROM VACATION?

24:36.005 --> 24:39.609
DON'T ASK ME WHY, BUT I GOT
A FEELING THERE'S A CONNECTION.

24:39.609 --> 24:41.981
WELL, CAN I STILL GET
A PRESCRIPTION REFILLED?

24:41.981 --> 24:42.982
Sure.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.814
DR. LYBRAND'S ON CALL.

24:44.814 --> 24:47.517
Could you see him tomorrow
around 2:00?

24:47.517 --> 24:49.519
ACTUALLY, I'VE MOVED.

24:49.519 --> 24:50.990
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.522
WHAT?

24:52.522 --> 24:53.663
I'M DONE.

24:53.663 --> 24:55.865
MEANING WHAT?

24:55.865 --> 24:59.498
I'M SURE WE CAN WORK IT OUT.
WHAT'S YOUR NEW ADDRESS?

24:59.498 --> 25:03.903
WHAT, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
ABANDON ME?
 I WENT ON THIS WILD GOOSE CHASE
AS FAR AS I COULD.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.836
OH, DON'T--PLEASE DON'T GO,
ROBERTA.

25:06.836 --> 25:08.507
I NEED YOUR HELP.

25:08.507 --> 25:12.682
THEN GET SOMEBODY ELSE.
I'M TAPPED OUT.

25:12.682 --> 25:16.786
ROBERTA, WAIT!

25:16.786 --> 25:20.890
"WISTERIA LANE."
WHAT A LOVELY NAME.

25:31.100 --> 25:34.103
BREE, YOU SURE THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP?

25:34.103 --> 25:37.536
I'M JUST STANDING HERE
WITH MY THUMB UP MY BUTT.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.208
UH, NO HELP NEEDED.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.571
CERTAINLY NOTHING
THAT WOULD REQUIRE YOUR THUMB.

25:41.571 --> 25:45.274
HEY. UH, SORRY WE'RE LATE.
WE GOT HUNG UP AT THE REALTORS.

25:45.274 --> 25:48.618
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME.
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO EAT.

25:48.618 --> 25:50.119
SHALL WE?
 YEAH.

25:50.119 --> 25:52.181
HMM. EXCUSE...

25:52.181 --> 25:54.854
(chuckles) EXCUSE ME, MELINA.
THAT'S MY CHAIR.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.857
I JUST WANTED
TO SIT NEXT TO THE BOYS.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.128
OH.

25:59.128 --> 26:01.090
WELL, DID IT OCCUR TO YOU

26:01.090 --> 26:03.663
I MIGHT WANT
TO SIT NEXT TO THE BOYS?

26:03.663 --> 26:06.335
DID IT OCCUR TO YOU
 THAT I ALREADY CALLED IT?

26:06.335 --> 26:10.339
SHE DID. SHE CALLED IT.

26:10.339 --> 26:12.341
WHY DON'T YOU SIT HERE,
BREE?

26:14.043 --> 26:17.977
(lowers voice) GUESS WHO JUST
CALLED THE BURNT LAMB CHOP?

26:17.977 --> 26:20.980
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACES

26:20.980 --> 26:23.112
WHEN YOU HEARD MY GOOD NEWS.

26:23.112 --> 26:25.154
REALLY? WHAT IS IT?

26:25.154 --> 26:27.617
WELL, I TOLD DR. HARDY
YOU'RE MOVING TO OAKDALE.

26:27.617 --> 26:29.959
UH, THINKING ABOUT IT.

26:29.959 --> 26:31.961
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT
MOVING TO OAKDALE.

26:31.961 --> 26:33.963
NOT AFTER THEY HEAR THIS.

26:33.963 --> 26:35.965
ANYWAY,
HE'S RETIRING NEXT MONTH,

26:35.965 --> 26:40.369
AND HE THINKS YOU'D BE PERFECT
TO TAKE OVER HIS PRACTICE.

26:40.369 --> 26:43.372
ARE YOU SERIOUS? WOW, THIS COULD
BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

26:43.372 --> 26:45.875
YES. A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

26:45.875 --> 26:48.337
FOR ANDREW TO COMMUTE
FIVE HOURS TO HIS JOB.

26:48.337 --> 26:51.781
I DON'T KNOW, ALEX. THIS IS
ALL HAPPENING PRETTY FAST.

26:51.781 --> 26:54.844
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE
GONNA BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOUSE,

26:54.844 --> 26:58.147
AND IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE KIDS...
 YOU'RE GONNA HAVE KIDS?

26:58.147 --> 27:01.891
OH, THIS IS PERFECT!
I CAN LOOK AFTER THEM FOR YOU!

27:01.891 --> 27:04.694
OH! LET'S TOAST
TO SEAL THE DEAL.

27:04.694 --> 27:07.897
HERE'S TO OAKDALE.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.236
I BOUGHT YOU THE ADAMS HOUSE!

27:17.236 --> 27:18.337
WHAT?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.670
WHAT?!
 WHAT?

27:20.670 --> 27:24.073
IT WAS GOING TO BE A SURPRISE,
YOU KNOW, FOR YOUR WEDDING.

27:24.073 --> 27:26.175
UNFORTUNATELY,
THIS WHOLE SILLY OAKDALE THING

27:26.175 --> 27:29.719
HAS FORCED ME TO SHOW MY HAND.

27:29.719 --> 27:31.380
MOM, THAT'S TOO GENEROUS.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.753
YES, THAT'S, UH...

27:33.753 --> 27:37.356
THAT'S WAY TOO GENEROUS.
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

27:37.356 --> 27:40.159
OH, IT'S NOTHING
 YOU WOULDN'T DO.

27:41.891 --> 27:44.764
BREE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, EXCEPT...

27:44.764 --> 27:47.236
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

27:47.236 --> 27:49.739
I REALLY LOVE YOU FOR THIS.

27:49.739 --> 27:52.241
OH, AND I LOVE YOU, TOO.

27:52.241 --> 27:56.445
ORSON, DEAR, WOULD YOU POUR
MELINA ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE?

27:56.445 --> 27:58.447
(under breath)
CALLING EDIE, ARE YOU?

27:58.447 --> 28:01.050
(lowers voice) YOU KNOW IT.
 (chuckles)

28:02.812 --> 28:05.785
HI, HONEY. YOU REMEMBER
BRADLEY AND HIS WIFE MARIA.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.787
THEY DROPPED BY FOR DINNER.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.959
HOW FUN.

28:09.959 --> 28:13.793
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT THE TRASH CANS?

28:13.793 --> 28:17.026
EXCUSE ME.

28:18.968 --> 28:21.971
(lowers voice) WHAT IS THAT
MISERABLE S.O.B. DOING HERE?

28:21.971 --> 28:24.904
I ALREADY TOOK THE JOB
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.907
I KNOW. JUST LISTEN TO WHAT
BRADLEY HAS TO SAY,

28:27.907 --> 28:30.910
AND IF AT THE END OF THE EVENING
YOU'RE STILL NOT INTERESTED,

28:30.910 --> 28:34.083
I SUPPORT YOU COMPLETELY.
DEAL?

28:34.083 --> 28:37.416
IF IT'LL GET YOU
OFF MY BACK... DEAL.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.721
AFTER I GOT CONCESSIONS
FROM THE UNION,

28:42.721 --> 28:44.723
I LAID OFF
A THIRD OF THE WORKFORCE,

28:44.723 --> 28:46.225
OUTSOURCED ANOTHER THIRD.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.999
A YEAR LATER, I SOLD THE COMPANY
FOR TWICE WHAT I PAID FOR IT.

28:49.999 --> 28:52.461
WOW. IMPRESSIVE. HUH, CARLOS?
 VERY.

28:52.461 --> 28:56.305
IT'LL BE A GREAT STORY TO TELL
ALL THE OTHER C.E.O.s IN HELL.

28:56.305 --> 28:58.768
CARLOS, BE NICE.

28:58.768 --> 29:01.841
NO, IT'S FINE.
JUST TAKING CARE OF MY KIDS.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.844
YEAH. I'VE GOT A PICTURE OF THEM
IN MY PURSE.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.846
WANNA SEE HOW MANY
YOU CAN NAME?

29:06.846 --> 29:08.347
MORE WINE, MARIA?

29:11.220 --> 29:14.353
SO, BRADLEY, IF CARLOS
WERE TO COME WORK FOR YOU,

29:14.353 --> 29:16.385
WHAT WOULD A TYPICAL WEEK
LOOK LIKE?

29:16.385 --> 29:18.387
OH, LOTS OF
HIGH-END DEAL MAKING,

29:18.387 --> 29:20.529
UH, INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL.

29:20.529 --> 29:23.232
(slurring) OH, YEAH. WE TRAVEL
ALL OVER THE WORLD TOGETHER.

29:23.232 --> 29:27.396
IT IS SO FUN SITTING ALONE
IN A FIVE-STAR HOTEL

29:27.396 --> 29:29.899
WHILE YOUR HUSBAND IS OUT
CRUSHING THE THIRD WORLD

29:29.899 --> 29:32.001
UNDER THE HEEL
OF HIS JACKBOOT.

29:33.803 --> 29:37.146
YOU HEAR THAT, CARLOS?
FIVE-STAR HOTELS.

29:37.146 --> 29:39.148
LISTEN, BRADLEY,

29:39.148 --> 29:41.780
REALLY APPRECIATE
THE OFFER,

29:41.780 --> 29:44.453
BUT I TOLD YOU--
I ALREADY HAVE A JOB.

29:44.453 --> 29:47.456
WHY CAN'T YOU DO YOUR WORK
WITH THE DEAF ON THE WEEKENDS?

29:47.456 --> 29:50.259
FIRST OF ALL,
BECAUSE THEY'RE BLIND.

29:50.259 --> 29:52.521
YOU TELL HIM. (chuckles)

29:52.521 --> 29:54.523
UM, HONEY, BRADLEY'S RIGHT.
YOU COULD TAKE THIS JOB

29:54.523 --> 29:56.866
AND DO YOUR CHARITY WORK
IN YOUR FREE TIME.

29:56.866 --> 29:59.498
NO, DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
YOU ARE A GOOD MAN,

29:59.498 --> 30:01.500
AND YOU ARE
GOING TO HELP PEOPLE.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.273
AND EVEN IF YOU NEVER
END UP MAKING A PENNY,

30:04.273 --> 30:07.877
YOU'LL BE WORTH MORE
THAN THIS SOULLESS BASTARD.

30:07.877 --> 30:10.279
I WORK VERY HARD TO PROVIDE
FOR YOU AND THE KIDS,

30:10.279 --> 30:12.281
AND I WOULD LIKE
A LITTLE RESPECT.

30:12.281 --> 30:15.414
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I
 WOULD LIKE? A BIG DIVORCE.

30:17.586 --> 30:19.288
(door opens)

30:19.288 --> 30:21.090
SO...
 (door closes)

30:21.090 --> 30:23.292
IS EYE CARE INCLUDED
IN THE HEALTH PLAN?

30:23.292 --> 30:26.155
'CAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY
A BIG ISSUE FOR CARLOS.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.400
MM.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.942
(Dave whispering)
DADDY MISSES YOU SO MUCH.

30:42.942 --> 30:46.315
I'M SO SORRY.

30:46.315 --> 30:48.347
(whispers indistinctly)
OKAY?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.920
BYE-BYE! I MISS YOU TWO
SO MUCH.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.922
(continues
whispering indistinctly)

30:52.922 --> 30:54.283
VERY SOON, HONEY.

30:54.283 --> 30:57.426
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE TEENY BIT LONGER.

30:57.426 --> 30:59.288
OH, MY LITTLE GIRL.

30:59.288 --> 31:03.162
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.464
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.967
WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER SOON.
I PROMISE YOU.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.499
JUST A TEENY LITTLE BIT.
IT'LL BE FINE.
 DAVE?

31:10.499 --> 31:12.501
(slaps hand)
 OW!

31:12.501 --> 31:13.872
AAH!

31:13.872 --> 31:17.506
(normal voice)
I'M SORRY. YOU SCARED ME.

31:17.506 --> 31:19.578
WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO?

31:21.350 --> 31:23.482
NO ONE.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.185
I HEARD YOU.

31:26.185 --> 31:29.488
EDIE, PLEASE, J--

31:31.520 --> 31:33.522
(whispers)
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

31:33.522 --> 31:37.296
WHO THE HELL WERE YOU
TALKING TO? (gasps)

31:37.296 --> 31:39.298
LEAVE ME ALONE.

31:56.185 --> 31:58.187
WHY DID YOU TURN
DOWN HERE?

32:05.254 --> 32:07.126
(shifts gears)

32:07.126 --> 32:09.999
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO THE STORE.

32:09.999 --> 32:14.403
(siren wailing in distance)

32:14.403 --> 32:17.436
MOM, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

32:21.440 --> 32:24.043
BEFORE I BECAME A MOTHER,

32:24.043 --> 32:26.045
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS POSSIBLE

32:26.045 --> 32:29.418
TO LOVE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
 SO COMPLETELY,

32:29.418 --> 32:33.252
AND WITH THAT LOVE
COMES THIS NEED TO PROTECT YOU.

32:34.723 --> 32:36.725
IT WASN'T A DECISION I MADE.

32:36.725 --> 32:38.727
IT'S... PRIMAL.

32:38.727 --> 32:40.559
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
IN MY D.N.A.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.331
WHATEVER IT IS,

32:42.331 --> 32:45.364
IT MAKES ME NOT CARE
ABOUT MYSELF,

32:45.364 --> 32:48.067
AND IT REMINDS ME

32:48.067 --> 32:50.499
THAT MY REASON
FOR BEING ON THIS PLANET

32:50.499 --> 32:53.502
IS TO LOOK AFTER YOU KIDS.

32:56.445 --> 32:59.148
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

32:59.148 --> 33:01.510
YESTERDAY, YOU SAID

33:01.510 --> 33:03.712
WARREN SCHILLING
WILL KILL PORTER

33:03.712 --> 33:06.115
IF HE GETS THE CHANCE.

33:08.517 --> 33:12.091
I WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN.

33:15.364 --> 33:17.026
MOM, WHERE ARE WE?

33:18.527 --> 33:20.329
YOU SEE THAT BAR?

33:20.329 --> 33:22.531
WARREN SCHILLING GOES THERE
EVERY NIGHT.

33:22.531 --> 33:24.233
(man) ALL RIGHT, COME ON!

33:24.233 --> 33:27.406
TONIGHT, WHEN HE LEAVES...

33:29.678 --> 33:33.712
I'M GONNA DO WHAT I HAVE TO,
TO MAKE SURE MY FAMILY IS SAFE.

33:37.246 --> 33:40.149
SO...

33:40.149 --> 33:41.450
(grunts)

33:44.393 --> 33:47.596
(sighs)
I NEED YOU TO GET OUT NOW.

33:47.596 --> 33:51.500
YOU CAN'T BE IN THE CAR
WHEN THIS HAPPENS.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.402
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

33:55.534 --> 33:58.537
YOU'RE GONNA RUN HIM OVER?

34:00.109 --> 34:03.672
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S IN MY D.N.A.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.646
(door opens)

34:07.646 --> 34:10.349
(men shouting indistinctly)
 THAT COULD BE HIM.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.821
GET OUT.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.725
GET OUT! GET OUT!

34:16.725 --> 34:20.559
OKAY! STOP IT! I GET IT!
I'LL CALL PORTER AND TELL HIM

34:20.559 --> 34:23.262
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT MR. SCHILLING.

34:23.262 --> 34:28.496
AND YOU WILL CONVINCE HIM
TO COME BACK HOME.

34:36.105 --> 34:38.277
SHUT THE DOOR.
 (shuts car door)

34:40.349 --> 34:42.551
(shifts car gears)

34:50.659 --> 34:52.460
SO... (sighs)

34:52.460 --> 34:55.824
REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID
I JUST HAD TO HEAR BRADLEY OUT,

34:55.824 --> 34:58.527
AND THEN WHATEVER I DECIDED,
YOU'D SUPPORT ME?

34:58.527 --> 35:00.529
WELL, YOU MAY BE SURPRISED,

35:00.529 --> 35:02.401
BUT I AM READY
TO RENDER MY DECISION.

35:04.473 --> 35:07.476
LET ME LAY IT OUT FOR YOU--

35:07.476 --> 35:09.438
EITHER I DO
SOMETHING FULFILLING

35:09.438 --> 35:12.441
WHERE I HELP OTHER PEOPLE
AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF,

35:12.441 --> 35:15.444
OR I TAKE A JOB I HATE
WHERE I MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,

35:15.444 --> 35:18.147
BUT IT EATS MY LIFE
AND CRUSHES MY SOUL.

35:18.147 --> 35:22.621
HANG ON. BEFORE YOU DO THAT,
LET ME LAY IT OUT FOR YOU.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.824
EITHER YOU LET YOUR FAMILY
CONTINUE TO SACRIFICE

35:25.824 --> 35:29.558
SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF,

35:29.558 --> 35:31.800
OR YOU GROW UP

35:31.800 --> 35:33.732
AND MAKE REAL MONEY

35:33.732 --> 35:35.404
AND LOOK AFTER US

35:35.404 --> 35:38.407
LIKE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AFTER
 YOU FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

35:38.407 --> 35:40.569
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE JOBS
ARE LIKE, GABY.

35:40.569 --> 35:42.441
I'D NEVER BE HOME.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.174
AND WHEN I WAS,
I'D BE TIRED OR IRRITATED.

35:45.174 --> 35:48.477
IT WILL TAKE A TOLL
ON ALL OF US.
 IT TOOK A TOLL ON US

35:48.477 --> 35:50.479
WHEN WE COULDN'T PAY
THE GAS BILL, CARLOS.

35:50.479 --> 35:52.481
IT TOOK A TOLL ON US

35:52.481 --> 35:54.483
WHEN JUANITA WAS SENT HOME
FROM DAY CARE

35:54.483 --> 35:56.355
BECAUSE THE CHECK BOUNCED.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.828
BUT I HANDLED IT, AND NOW
IT'S YOUR TURN TO HANDLE IT.

35:59.828 --> 36:02.591
GABY, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS.

36:02.591 --> 36:04.893
(sighs)

36:14.643 --> 36:19.278
(beeping)

36:21.910 --> 36:24.753
BRADLEY? HEY, IT'S CARLOS.

36:24.753 --> 36:28.417
WELL, I'VE, UH,
DONE SOME THINKING,

36:28.417 --> 36:30.659
AND I ACTUALLY...

36:32.591 --> 36:35.464
I WANT THAT JOB,

36:35.464 --> 36:37.896
IF IT'S STILL ON THE TABLE.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.598
(kisses)

36:42.200 --> 36:43.572
YEAH.

36:43.572 --> 36:45.234
I WAS SURPRISED, TOO.

36:47.536 --> 36:49.538
(Carlos) SOUNDS GREAT.

36:52.681 --> 36:54.683
SEE YOU MONDAY.

36:56.345 --> 36:57.716
(knocks on door)

36:57.716 --> 37:00.449
(man singing opera)

37:00.449 --> 37:02.821
HEY, SUSAN. I JUST MADE TEA.
COME ON IN.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.523
LEE, UM...

37:04.523 --> 37:06.595
♪♪♪

37:06.595 --> 37:09.898
WELL, THERE'S JUST NO
GRACEFUL WAY TO ASK THIS, SO...

37:09.898 --> 37:12.531
I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT
STRAIGHT OUT.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.863
WHEN YOU SPENT THE NIGHT,

37:14.863 --> 37:16.865
DID WE GET IT ON?
(chuckles nervously)

37:16.865 --> 37:21.810
(man sustaining note,
volume increases)

37:21.810 --> 37:23.742
(turns off music)

37:23.742 --> 37:25.744
YE GODS, NO.
ARE YOU INSANE?

37:25.744 --> 37:28.417
OH! SO... NOTHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN US?

37:28.417 --> 37:29.718
HELLO? GAY!

37:29.718 --> 37:31.720
LISTENING TO OPERA
IN A KIMONO.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.882
WHAT MORE
DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?

37:33.882 --> 37:35.584
(sighs) OH, THANK GOD.

37:35.584 --> 37:38.557
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WOKE UP
NEXT TO YOU YESTERDAY,

37:38.557 --> 37:41.560
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.
 BUT WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

37:41.560 --> 37:44.563
'CAUSE YOU WERE MAD AT BOB,
AND I TOLD YOU

37:44.563 --> 37:47.596
ABOUT HOW I SOMETIMES
SABOTAGE MY RELATIONSHIPS.

37:47.596 --> 37:48.567
AH. WELL, YOU DIDN'T.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.539
NOT THIS TIME, ANYWAY.

37:50.539 --> 37:52.941
YAY. (chuckles)

37:52.941 --> 37:56.305
NOW I CAN MOVE IN WITH JACKSON
WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE.

37:56.305 --> 37:58.677
(slaps leg)
 GOOD. GOOD.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.450
WAIT, SO I JUST--
I HAVE TO ASK.

38:01.450 --> 38:04.513
WHY EXACTLY ARE YOU
MOVING IN WITH JACKSON?

38:04.513 --> 38:06.985
BECAUSE...

38:06.985 --> 38:08.657
HE LOVES ME.

38:08.657 --> 38:11.460
DO YOU LOVE HIM?

38:11.460 --> 38:13.892
I'M GETTING THERE.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.366
DON'T YOU THINK
MAYBE YOU SHOULD...

38:17.366 --> 38:19.798
WAIT UNTIL YOU'VE ARRIVED?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.771
MIKE AND I WILL NEVER
GET BACK TOGETHER.

38:22.771 --> 38:25.033
I KNOW THAT NOW.

38:25.033 --> 38:28.907
AND I REALLY NEED
TO MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE.

38:28.907 --> 38:32.511
YOU KNOW MOVING ON
DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN MOVING IN.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.513
JACKSON HAS MADE IT
PRETTY CLEAR

38:34.513 --> 38:37.516
THAT HE DOESN'T DO GOOD WITH
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.818
I COULD LOSE HIM.
 SO LOSE HIM.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.951
I'M NOT GOOD ALONE.
I NEED A MAN IN MY LIFE.

38:42.951 --> 38:44.793
BUT WHY? WE'RE SO USELESS.

38:44.793 --> 38:48.397
BUT YOU ARE
FUN TO DANCE WITH.

38:52.060 --> 38:54.663
(sighs)

38:54.663 --> 38:57.366
I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL JACKSON
YOU'RE NOT READY.

38:57.366 --> 38:59.368
AND IF HE ENDS UP LEAVING,

38:59.368 --> 39:01.570
THEN, HELL,
 I WILL DANCE WITH YOU.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.072
AT LEAST UNTIL SOMEONE BETTER
COMES ALONG.

39:04.072 --> 39:06.074
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

39:07.576 --> 39:10.579
IF THIS IS YOUR ATTEMPT
AT BEDDING ME AGAIN, MISS MAYER,

39:10.579 --> 39:13.522
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

39:13.522 --> 39:15.524
(laughs)

39:26.765 --> 39:28.467
COME ON, MAN.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.470
MOM REALLY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU,
JUST FOR FIVE SECONDS.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.472
DO IT FOR ME, OKAY?

39:35.574 --> 39:37.075
SWEETIE, WHERE ARE YOU?

39:37.075 --> 39:39.578
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU.
 Porter...

39:39.578 --> 39:41.580
YOU HAVE GOT TO COME HOME.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.381
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.585
HOW? EITHER WARREN SCHILLING
KILLS ME, OR I END UP IN JAIL.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.087
WE CAN GET A RESTRAINING ORDER
TO PROTECT YOU,

39:49.087 --> 39:51.119
AND BOB THINKS
THERE'S A GOOD SHOT

39:51.119 --> 39:53.562
AT GETTING THE CASE DISMISSED.

39:53.562 --> 39:55.864
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN READING
THE FAIRVIEW PAPERS ONLINE.

39:55.864 --> 39:59.528
EVERYBODY THINKS I DID IT.
 There is not a shred
of evidence against you.

39:59.528 --> 40:02.531
WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT,
THEY WILL BE ON YOUR SIDE

40:02.531 --> 40:04.402
JUST LIKE WE ARE.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.404
Sweetie,
you have to trust me.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.406
I DO TRUST YOU.
IT'S JUST I--

40:08.406 --> 40:10.639
(beep)
 DON'T FALL FOR IT, KIDDO.

40:10.639 --> 40:14.112
I TRUSTED HER ONCE,
AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT ME.

40:18.487 --> 40:21.189
GOOD MORNING.

40:21.189 --> 40:24.693
IS IT?
I DIDN'T GET A LOT OF SLEEP.

40:26.194 --> 40:28.827
OKAY, ABOUT LAST NIGHT,
UH...

40:28.827 --> 40:30.599
I'M SORRY.

40:30.599 --> 40:32.601
LET ME STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

40:32.601 --> 40:35.433
I DON'T NEED AN APOLOGY.
I NEED AN EXPLANATION.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.866
(sighs)

40:37.866 --> 40:41.470
AND... (sighs)
IF YOU CAN'T GIVE ME ONE...

40:41.470 --> 40:44.913
I'M THINKING WE'RE FINISHED.

40:44.913 --> 40:48.577
LOOK, I'M JUST STRESSED OUT.

40:48.577 --> 40:53.081
STRESS DOESN'T MAKE YOU TALK
TO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T THERE.

40:53.081 --> 40:55.484
WHAT IS GOING ON?

40:55.484 --> 40:57.986
OKAY.

41:03.031 --> 41:05.794
BEFORE WE MET,
I WAS MARRIED TO SOMEONE ELSE.

41:08.537 --> 41:11.099
BUT SHE DIED.

41:11.099 --> 41:13.101
AND LAST NIGHT SHE WAS...

41:13.101 --> 41:15.103
SORT OF ON MY MIND.

41:15.103 --> 41:19.578
YOU WERE MARRIED BEFORE?

41:19.578 --> 41:23.752
SHE'S DEAD, EDIE.
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

41:23.752 --> 41:25.584
OH, IT MATTERS.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.664
YOU HAVE UNTIL TONIGHT

41:35.664 --> 41:37.966
TO GET YOUR THINGS TOGETHER.

41:37.966 --> 41:41.570
THEN I WANT YOU
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

41:47.035 --> 41:50.779
EVERYONE NEEDS A LOVELY HOME
IN SUBURBIA,

41:50.779 --> 41:54.212
MOSTLY SO THE NEIGHBORS
WILL NEVER SUSPECT

41:54.212 --> 41:57.946
WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE.

41:57.946 --> 42:01.189
BEHIND
THESE FRESHLY PAINTED WALLS

42:01.189 --> 42:02.951
YOU WILL FIND...

42:02.951 --> 42:06.725
PARENTS WRACKED WITH GUILT...

42:08.957 --> 42:13.001
WIVES TIRED OF STRUGGLING...

42:15.604 --> 42:20.108
LOVERS WHO HAVE BEEN LIED TO...

42:24.613 --> 42:30.048
YES, EVERYBODY NEEDS
A LOVELY HOME IN SUBURBIA...

42:33.622 --> 42:38.286
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN TO HAVE A PLACE...

42:38.286 --> 42:41.590
TO COME HOME TO.
