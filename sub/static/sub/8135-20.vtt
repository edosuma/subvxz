00:00.967 --> 00:03.162
You know, I don't like you.

00:06.072 --> 00:07.801
Sam!
No!

00:08.742 --> 00:11.677
Somebody's declared war on an alliance
of local truckers down here.

00:11.745 --> 00:16.011
- This is Terri the Tiger.
I've got a 10-33.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.550
- What's a 10-33?
- A call for help, buddy.

00:22.789 --> 00:25.417
The last thing this town needs
is outside agitation.

00:41.708 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

01:56.382 --> 02:00.443
Breaker, breaker, Big Brother for
Terri the Tiger. Come on back, now.

02:00.520 --> 02:05.116
Terri the Tiger reading you just fine,
Big Brother. How's it going out there?

02:05.191 --> 02:08.388
Almost home free, sis. Estimated
time of arrival, one hour.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.895
That's a big 10-4.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.705
Pull over!

02:57.410 --> 02:59.469
Pull over!

03:35.782 --> 03:38.250
Out!

03:39.886 --> 03:41.945
Come on!

05:04.370 --> 05:07.066
Michael, I'm picking up
a transmission...

05:07.140 --> 05:10.007
in a highly stylized dialect
of the English language.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.510
No, kidding? Let's hear it.

05:12.578 --> 05:15.570
Roll your windows down, good buddy.
Come on back, 10-4.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.617
That's C.B...

05:18.685 --> 05:21.654
Citizen's Band, KITT...
Trucker's lingo.

05:21.721 --> 05:27.250
- In other words, slang.
- I still remember a lot of it from my police days.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.659
- You want me to teach it to you?
- I'd rather you didn't.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.430
Michael, Devon is calling.

05:35.501 --> 05:39.198
Patch him through.
Give it to me. I'm taking over.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.568
Hello, Michael. I trust
we're not disturbing anything.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.441
I thought you'd be in Chicago by now.

05:46.512 --> 05:50.414
My plane leaves within the hour.
Michael, something's come up.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.451
I haven't got all the details yet,

05:52.518 --> 05:55.385
but the president of Micro-Tech
Electronics called me this morning.

05:55.455 --> 05:58.288
A shipment of highly sensitive
electronic components...

05:58.358 --> 06:00.690
was stolen near Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.161
Any idea who took 'em?
Uh, none, I'm afraid.

06:04.230 --> 06:08.929
The odd thing is that the parts
were labeled falsely to discourage theft.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.970
The driver of the truck was shot
and wounded, but he's all right.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.097
I've already contacted him.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.267
He's expecting you.
Devon.

06:17.343 --> 06:20.642
Yes, I know, Michael.
You're due for some R & R,

06:20.713 --> 06:25.650
but look at it this way: Would you
rather go to New Mexico or Chicago?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.879
Chicago in March?

06:27.954 --> 06:32.220
I am on my way to New Mexico...
On one condition:

06:32.291 --> 06:35.419
You bring me back
some deep-dish pizza.

06:35.495 --> 06:38.896
The best pizza in the world
is made in Chicago, Illinois.

06:38.965 --> 06:43.129
Your eclectic culinary tastes
never cease to amaze me, my dear boy.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.899
All right. I'll do my best.
Thank you too much.

07:24.644 --> 07:29.308
Hi.
I'm Michael Knight.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.510
Devon Miles called about me. I'm
Rick Calley. This is my sister Terri.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.576
Hey, Terri.
Hi.

07:34.654 --> 07:38.613
You know the company I represent, they're
real anxious to find that missing shipment.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.387
Well, I'd trade problems with you
in a minute, friend.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.988
You've only lost one shipment. A.I.T. has
already lost six, not to mention the sabotage.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.397
A.I.T? What's A.I.T? The
Alliance of Independent Truckers.

07:48.468 --> 07:53.201
My daddy founded it 12 years ago to stop
the men from undercutting each other.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.365
I'm sure glad he's not here today
to see what's happening.

07:55.441 --> 07:59.036
There's no more he would've done
than what I'm doing.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.807
Rick, I didn't... Listen, Knight,
you got any more questions...

08:01.881 --> 08:04.907
why don't you ask Terri,
she seems to know everything.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.333
Hey, babe! You wanna stop over
the Tick Tock later?

08:24.403 --> 08:26.394
It's nickle beer night.

08:26.472 --> 08:28.940
Curt, don't you ever quit?

08:29.008 --> 08:32.307
Not when it's something
I want.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.677
Hey, Rick! How's it going?
Don't pay any attention to him.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.116
Hardly noticed he was there.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.746
Terri, can you get me a list
of the A.I.T. truckers?

08:42.822 --> 08:45.916
I can do better. We're having a
meeting tonight. Why don't you come by?

08:45.992 --> 08:48.290
Thanks. I will.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.388
I wanna start running down that stolen cargo
right away. What's the procedure around here?

08:52.465 --> 08:55.161
We pick up the freight
at Riggins Distributor.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.293
Gil Riggins fought Daddy
over the alliance,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.235
but they were old friends.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.866
- He'll help you any way he can.
- All right. Thanks.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.605
That dog. I'll be right back.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.482
Michael, surely you don't expect me
to move that monster.

09:16.556 --> 09:21.084
No sense in spinning
our wheels, KITT.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.993
Let's spin his.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.972
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

09:55.595 --> 09:57.688
What is your role in all of this?

09:57.763 --> 10:01.961
Mr. Riggins, I'm a freelance
investigator for Micro-Tech.

10:02.034 --> 10:05.162
I'd also like to find out who's
hitting all the A.I.T. trucks.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.228
Who wouldn't?

10:07.306 --> 10:11.072
Look, once this stuff leaves my
warehouse, it's out of my hands.

10:11.143 --> 10:13.338
It's a shame, though,
about those truckers.

10:13.412 --> 10:16.404
They're good people. I know
most of them personally.

10:16.482 --> 10:19.747
No kidding? I heard it
wasn't always that way.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.980
No, not always.

10:22.054 --> 10:25.114
Ted Calley and I
fought tooth and nail,

10:25.191 --> 10:28.024
but as soon as he organized
those men, that was it.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.029
I even sent a keg of beer
to their first meeting.

10:31.097 --> 10:35.466
Now... Look, get that fruit
in out of the sun, will you?

10:35.534 --> 10:39.368
Anything else? No, I can't
think of anything else.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.497
Thanks for your help.
Anytime.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.202
I hope you find the people
responsible for this.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.677
My suppliers won't stand
for any more losses.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.485
Well, I think we should
get some artillery...

10:56.555 --> 10:58.546
and take care of
our own business.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.888
Now, you listen to me,
all of you.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.588
I got 3,750 square miles
to cover,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.291
including two reservations.

11:06.365 --> 11:10.563
I got three patrol cars
and six men to do it.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.366
Now, if you want the kind of
protection you're asking me to give you,

11:13.439 --> 11:15.430
then you get 'em to raise
the county budget.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.499
Okay, now you listen to me,
Hank.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.409
Those outlaws grab my shipment
one more time,

11:20.479 --> 11:23.107
I'm done in...
I've had it.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.776
I got three kids,
I got a wife,

11:25.851 --> 11:28.843
and I got more bills
than you can shake a stick at.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.583
Now, that's what I got.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.756
I hear you, Gene. You
just make sure you hear me.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.457
Yeah.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.660
Calley, I hope you'll use
your influence on these men,

11:42.735 --> 11:46.102
'cause I'm gonna come down hard
on anybody that breaks the law.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.606
Trucker, hijacker,
it don't make no difference.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.708
Well, you all heard
what the sheriff had to say.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.111
Before we finish up here, there's a
fella who wants to talk to you about...

11:58.184 --> 12:00.243
something a little different.

12:00.319 --> 12:03.083
Volker, you out there?

12:07.359 --> 12:11.420
Fellas, uh, I got a little
business proposition.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.466
I'm just passin' through
on my way to Tucson.

12:14.533 --> 12:18.333
I heard about the trouble
you all got.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.237
I sure hate to see you good people
in this position.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.832
I know what it's like.
I been there myself.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.776
I'm an independent trucker too,

12:26.846 --> 12:31.442
but, uh, I got a little lucky,
saved some money.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.077
Here's a proposition:

12:34.153 --> 12:38.351
You sell me your trucks,
at a fair price,

12:38.424 --> 12:41.484
and each and every one of you
has a lifetime job.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.655
How much you offerin'?

12:47.733 --> 12:50.827
I don't believe you, Gene.

12:50.903 --> 12:53.599
I remember the nights
you used to come over to the house,

12:53.672 --> 12:55.833
cryin' to Daddy about the squeeze
Riggins used to put on you.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.741
Yeah, and I remember when you used to
run around with your hair in pigtails.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.302
You ain't so much older now,
and you sure ain't got no answers.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.907
Let the man finish sayin'
what he wants to say.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.042
That's about it.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.987
I'm stayin' at the, uh,
Wagon Wheel Motel.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.047
I'll be there for a day
or two.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.026
I can deal with you
as a group...

13:16.095 --> 13:18.859
or as individuals...
It's up to you.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.934
You know where to find me.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.935
Well, y'all heard
what he had to say.

13:32.011 --> 13:35.105
A couple of months ago we would
have laughed him out of town.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.240
I don't see anybody laughing now.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.959
I'd like a word with you, son.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.666
Well, I'm easy to talk to.
What's on your mind?

14:01.740 --> 14:04.641
You've been askin'
a lot of questions.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.235
I just wanted you to know
I'm keeping an eye on you.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.282
The last thing this town needs
is outside agitation.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.284
Well, agitation is not
my line of work, Sheriff.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.150
I'm a freelance investigator.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.417
You better be.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.455
How ya doin'?
Rotten.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.965
Wanna go dancin'
at the Tick Tock?

14:28.033 --> 14:31.025
I hear it's nickel beer night.

14:31.103 --> 14:34.095
Did you see The Alamo?

14:34.173 --> 14:36.869
The Alamo?
About 15 times.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.001
I like The Duke.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.547
This place is beginning
to feel like that.

14:43.616 --> 14:48.883
It's like when Sam Houston said,
"Everybody's complainin' and bellyachin',

14:48.954 --> 14:51.218
and what we need
is reinforcements."

14:51.290 --> 14:53.918
Yeah. Well, if I can't
talk you into dancin',

14:53.993 --> 14:56.052
how about a ride home?

14:56.128 --> 14:58.892
Already talked me into that.
Okay.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.677
Come on. Just tell her the meeting
ran late. Let's go get loaded.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.111
Let's go.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.512
You can get drunk anytime.
I got plans for Knight.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.177
Yeah? Go get your Friday Night
Special and meet me back here.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.578
This car has more gauges
than my tractor.

15:47.646 --> 15:51.173
Where's the C.B?
It's gotta be in there somewhere.

15:54.253 --> 15:57.347
What's your handle?
My handle?

15:57.423 --> 16:00.950
Oh, my handle,
it's, um, it's KITT.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.290
Kitt?

16:03.362 --> 16:05.922
Kind of a dull name
for such a flashy car.

16:05.998 --> 16:09.399
It's the best I could do
on short notice.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.493
Who are you, Michael Knight?

16:11.570 --> 16:14.869
I know, freelance investigator.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.465
But on the road you get
a certain feel for people.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.637
I wonder who you really are.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.580
"Smile when you say that,
stranger."

16:23.649 --> 16:26.641
The Virginian. Gary Cooper
said that to... Uh...

16:26.719 --> 16:29.517
I forget.
Yeah, I forget too.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.038
No matter what happens,

16:48.107 --> 16:51.167
I don't wanna
give up the highway.

16:51.243 --> 16:54.337
I think it's in my blood.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.439
Travelin' cross-country once,

16:57.516 --> 16:59.507
I got to the desert,

16:59.585 --> 17:02.748
and the stars were so bright...

17:02.821 --> 17:05.550
I turned off my headlight
and I pulled over...

17:07.059 --> 17:10.222
and I just sat there,

17:10.295 --> 17:13.025
and I looked and I listened.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.224
Nothing but stars and silence.

17:17.301 --> 17:19.395
No better high than that.

17:20.472 --> 17:23.464
Isolation. Freedom.

17:23.541 --> 17:27.979
What's it like in the big city?
A lot less stars.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.312
A whole lotta glitter.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.154
See you tomorrow.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.524
Michael, I've been monitoring
C.B. channels, and Terri's right.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.121
"KITT" is rather dull.
How about "Hot Knight"?

18:19.198 --> 18:21.393
"Hot Knight."
"Hot Knight."

18:21.467 --> 18:23.833
That's definitely got a ring to it.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.769
- Thank you.
- Don't let it go to your computer banks.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.774
- I won't.
- Put on your ears, good buddy.

18:29.842 --> 18:33.107
- I beg your pardon?
- Go into surveillance mode.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.736
Oh.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.415
Good evening.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.369
How do we know
which room he's in?

19:08.447 --> 19:11.507
There's that car of his
parked right in front of it.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.378
I still don't know how it did that.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.856
It won't matter when
we get done with it.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.267
Ow!

19:45.184 --> 19:47.277
Michael, Michael!

19:47.352 --> 19:50.446
Yeah, KITT, what is it?

19:50.522 --> 19:53.855
Michael, two men are out here
causing quite a racket.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.985
Oh.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.966
Somethin' funny about this.

20:07.272 --> 20:10.139
I can't believe it!

20:15.981 --> 20:18.779
A little early
for my wake-up call, guys.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.214
You tryin' to make
a fool out of me, or what?

20:26.291 --> 20:28.418
Looks like you did that
for yourself.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.961
You know, I don't like you.

20:31.029 --> 20:33.759
I don't like you messin' around
with Terri Calley.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.562
Curt, give me your bridge.

20:37.669 --> 20:40.968
Hang on, Curt.
I'm comin' around.

20:55.988 --> 20:59.355
Ozzie, Curt, get over here.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.551
Sheriff, this here car
moved by itself.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.852
Shut up, Ozzie.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.330
I warned you, Knight.
And I listened.

21:07.399 --> 21:11.699
You might've done a lot better warning those guys who
just introduced themselves to my car with baseball bats.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.863
Oh, I'll handle them.
Don't worry about that.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.464
What I'm more interested in
right now is you.

21:16.541 --> 21:19.135
You see, I ran a make on you,

21:19.211 --> 21:21.372
and I can't find
a trace of you anywhere.

21:21.446 --> 21:26.474
Is that against the law?
I'll let you know.

21:31.423 --> 21:34.051
Sheriff, the damn car
moved by itself!

21:34.126 --> 21:37.857
Get on out of here, the both of you,
and go home before I run you in.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.367
Devon, I know
what you're going to say...

22:18.437 --> 22:22.168
finding the electronic components
parts should take priority.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.800
Very well put, Michael,
but not entirely correct.

22:24.876 --> 22:27.970
What I was going to say was that I would
have brought back your pizza for you,

22:28.046 --> 22:30.412
but I couldn't fit it
into my briefcase...

22:30.482 --> 22:32.712
and then I was going
to launch into the rest.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.775
All right, go with me on this.

22:34.853 --> 22:38.380
I'm tellin' ya, the A.I.T. truckers
are fighting for survival.

22:38.457 --> 22:41.949
There she is.
Beautiful as ever.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.393
Sleepless as ever.

22:44.463 --> 22:49.400
I got all I could. The background on Sam Volker may
not surprise you, but I think it'll interest you.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.527
What is it?

22:51.603 --> 22:54.197
Mr. Volker's employed
by Prairie Trucking.

22:54.272 --> 22:56.934
His job is to buy out
struggling independents.

22:57.008 --> 23:00.705
If the A.I.T. knew that,
they'd skin him alive.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.270
Mm. Michael, I have a
new addition for you.

23:03.348 --> 23:06.249
I'm installing
a long-range tracking scope.

23:10.689 --> 23:14.921
It will enable you to monitor the location
of any A.I.T. truck with a C.B. radio.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.984
No kidding?

23:17.062 --> 23:20.463
That should give KITT a chance
to brush up on his trucker lingo.

23:20.532 --> 23:24.332
Trucker shorthand brutalizes
my vocabulary banks.

23:29.841 --> 23:32.071
You call soon as you get
to Santa Fe.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.942
You don't believe it,
but I worry about you.

23:35.013 --> 23:38.676
Um, I will, Gil.
Thanks for your concern.

23:44.289 --> 23:47.690
Surprised to see you
without your, uh, lover boy.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.227
He's not my lover boy, Curt.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.786
Where's Rick?

23:52.864 --> 23:55.492
He doesn't know I'm goin' out
single, and don't you tell him.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.762
We need this run.
We need the money.

23:57.836 --> 24:00.828
You want me
to ride with you,

24:00.906 --> 24:03.875
or are you afraid we
might ignite some sparks?

24:03.942 --> 24:06.001
You put your finger on it.

24:06.077 --> 24:08.409
Thanks anyway.

24:24.429 --> 24:27.626
KITT, how's the new tracking
scope working? Perfectly, Michael.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.190
I must say, the more I listen
to C.B. channels,

24:30.268 --> 24:32.327
the more impressed I am
with truck drivers.

24:32.404 --> 24:36.306
Oh, yeah? Why's that? Their
concern for wildlife, for example.

24:36.374 --> 24:40.310
Every time one of them spots a bear, they
immediately report it to all the others.

24:40.378 --> 24:43.313
I find that most praiseworthy.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.975
Me too, KITT. Me too.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.982
I wanna talk to you.

25:22.053 --> 25:25.648
I buy trucks, son,
not souped-up cars.

25:25.724 --> 25:29.023
I'm not here to sell you anything.
I'm here to warn you.

25:29.094 --> 25:32.928
Mr. Volker, you're no independent
businessman just passing through.

25:32.998 --> 25:36.832
You're a broker for Prairie Trucking, one
of the biggest fleets in the Southwest.

25:36.902 --> 25:39.234
Who are you? What right have
you got checking up on me?

25:39.304 --> 25:43.240
Let me put it this way: Consider yourself
lucky I'm the one who found out first.

25:43.308 --> 25:46.800
If some of the A.I.T. truckers did, you'd
be picking up your teeth off the floor.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.870
Like it or not,
I make my money legally.

25:49.948 --> 25:53.145
You make your money
off people's misery and desperation.

25:54.252 --> 25:57.221
Now, you wanna stick
around and play out your hand,

25:57.289 --> 25:59.280
you might live to regret it,

25:59.357 --> 26:02.053
but if I find out you or your
company is behind these hijackings,

26:02.127 --> 26:05.824
you will live to regret it...
Now, that's a promise.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.529
Pull over, you hear me!

26:45.170 --> 26:48.367
This is Terri the Tiger.
I've got a 10-33. Repeat.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.465
I've got a 10-33. Over.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.874
Michael, Michael!

26:54.279 --> 26:56.338
Michael.
Yeah, KITT. What is it?

26:56.414 --> 26:58.439
Michael, according
to my tracking scope,

26:58.516 --> 27:01.178
Terri is driving one of
the Calley tractors, due north.

27:01.252 --> 27:04.050
She's on a run?
Apparently so.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.784
She's announcing a "10-33."
What's a "10-33"?

27:08.193 --> 27:10.320
That's a call for help.

27:10.395 --> 27:12.886
Let's go.

27:44.963 --> 27:49.662
- How much farther, KITT?
- Less than five miles, Michael... 4.3, to be exact.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.879
Pop the sunroof!

28:42.954 --> 28:45.616
Michael, you're not going to do
what I think you're going to do.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.759
Take over.

28:51.830 --> 28:55.129
You are going to do
what I thought you were going to do.

29:15.653 --> 29:19.316
Michael, how did you...

29:19.390 --> 29:21.449
You don't wanna know.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.783
Are you all right, Terri?
I'm okay.

29:53.992 --> 29:57.086
Why didn't you tell me you were
going out? I didn't want you to worry.

29:57.162 --> 29:59.221
Worry? Terri, they got
our best tractor.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.356
You jeopardize whatever's left
of our business.

30:01.432 --> 30:03.366
You go out there in
no-man's-land... All right, Rick.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.527
I didn't tell ya
because we need the money.

30:05.603 --> 30:09.699
I thought I could do it.
I failed. Okay, I'm sorry.

30:09.774 --> 30:11.742
I guess Riggins'll cancel
the contract now.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.040
Why worry about that? We're
in a no-win situation, Terri.

30:14.112 --> 30:17.513
We go out there, we get killed.
We stay in, we're out of business.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.709
Don't you understand that?
What is the use?

30:24.589 --> 30:27.490
He's right.
No, Terri, he's not right.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.255
We're not through yet.
What's there to do?

30:30.328 --> 30:32.421
We've been attacked,
shot at...

30:32.497 --> 30:36.900
and no one has a clue why or
who or when it will ever end.

30:36.968 --> 30:39.163
All right, just hang on, okay?

30:39.237 --> 30:41.705
I'm still working on a few things.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.832
Are you with me?

30:49.147 --> 30:51.081
Okay.

31:12.103 --> 31:14.264
That appears to be Sam Volker.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.398
Looks like he stopped
for more than just coffee.

31:21.179 --> 31:24.205
That's the best tip I've had
in a long time.

31:24.282 --> 31:27.342
You deserve nothin'
but the best.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.887
See ya later.
Bye.

31:32.957 --> 31:35.858
Oh, can I talk to you
for a minute?

31:35.927 --> 31:38.122
Sure. What's on your mind,
Norma?

31:38.196 --> 31:41.927
Well, I lived in Holbrook
my whole life.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.198
I know every street sign. I know the ones that
are crooked, and the ones that are straight.

31:46.271 --> 31:50.173
The other day I figured out
I poured 91,000 cups of coffee.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.232
Do you believe that?
No.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.938
If I stay here much longer,
I'm gonna go crazy.

31:55.013 --> 31:59.313
Wait a minute. Why are
you tellin' me all this?

31:59.384 --> 32:02.911
Take it easy on Sam.
He's not a bad man.

32:02.987 --> 32:06.013
He's like the rest of us,
just tryin' to get by.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.718
That's all.
All right.

32:08.793 --> 32:11.956
I'll remember that. Okay. Thanks.

32:16.634 --> 32:19.501
Yeah, KITT, what is it?
Michael, my sensors detect...

32:19.570 --> 32:21.765
an explosive device
in Sam Volker's car.

32:21.839 --> 32:26.299
- It's set to detonate in ten seconds.
- Volker! Get out of the car!

32:30.782 --> 32:33.774
Sam! Sam!
No!

32:47.198 --> 32:49.257
Hey, Knight!

32:52.537 --> 32:54.528
Funny thing about you.

32:54.605 --> 32:56.596
What's that, Sheriff?
Wherever there's trouble,

32:56.674 --> 32:59.575
I look around,
and there you are.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.740
I just came to the cafe for
dinner. Norma can tell you that.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.511
I've already asked her.

33:08.319 --> 33:13.256
Until the fire department completes its
investigation, I want you to stick around.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.760
One minute you tell me to leave town, the
next minute you tell me to stick around.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.895
A fella could get real dizzy
listening to you, Sheriff.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.315
Good evening.
Nice to see a friendly face.

33:48.393 --> 33:52.489
I heard what happened.
I just can't believe it.

33:52.563 --> 33:55.225
First the hijackings,
now a murder.

33:55.299 --> 33:57.358
All right, what's wrong?

33:58.836 --> 34:00.895
It's Rick.

34:00.972 --> 34:04.430
He wants to quit,
sell the tractors, move.

34:04.509 --> 34:07.205
How about you?
How do you feel?

34:07.278 --> 34:10.406
I don't know.

34:10.481 --> 34:13.813
I just don't know anymore.
Terri, it's your decision too.

34:13.885 --> 34:18.150
From what I know about you, I didn't think
"quitting" was part of the Calley vocabulary.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.589
You think your father would have
quit? You think Gary Cooper would've?

34:24.362 --> 34:28.924
Michael, I scare
all the boys off.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.230
They used to call me
"Tomboy Terri."

34:31.302 --> 34:33.270
That was a long time ago.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.264
I think...

34:37.341 --> 34:39.605
I really like you.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.971
What do you say...

34:44.248 --> 34:46.944
we just hold each other?

34:47.018 --> 34:49.213
I feel so...
Shh.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.915
Yeah, that-a-girl.

34:54.992 --> 34:57.153
It's not so bad now, is it?

34:57.228 --> 34:59.287
No.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.258
Devon, I'm starting
to feel like Sheriff Winston:

35:05.336 --> 35:09.500
3,750 square miles to cover
and no leads.

35:09.574 --> 35:12.839
- Anything I can do?
- Now that you mention it,

35:12.910 --> 35:15.037
Chicago was pretty cold,
wasn't it?

35:15.113 --> 35:17.946
Oh, cold is not the word, dear boy.

35:18.015 --> 35:20.643
How would you like to visit
sunny New Mexico?

35:35.199 --> 35:37.690
My name is Cedric Bagshaw.

35:37.768 --> 35:40.703
I represent a large
manufacturing concern.

35:40.771 --> 35:45.105
My company is expanding its markets from
the Mountain states to the Southwest.

35:45.176 --> 35:49.636
We need to ship goods from Denver to
various locations in New Mexico and Arizona.

35:49.714 --> 35:55.209
I've had discussions
with several large trucking firms,

35:55.286 --> 35:58.221
but I would prefer to deal with
independents whenever it is possible.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.450
Mr. Bagshaw,
I think it's only fair to warn you...

36:00.525 --> 36:02.516
that we've had trouble
getting goods to market.

36:02.593 --> 36:04.527
In fact, that's a hell
of an understatement.

36:04.595 --> 36:09.259
I'm quite aware of your problems, but
I'm convinced that they can be resolved.

36:09.333 --> 36:13.030
After all, this is not the Old West.

36:13.104 --> 36:17.063
I want you to make a run. Show
me that you can meet a deadline.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.507
Show me you will fight
for a contract.

36:19.577 --> 36:23.479
I need a driver for our rig
for tomorrow morning.

36:23.548 --> 36:28.042
If that person can deliver
our shipment to Denver on time,

36:28.119 --> 36:31.418
I can virtually guarantee
this alliance of yours...

36:31.489 --> 36:34.617
a lengthy and profitable contract.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.972
Well, are you on?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.201
You're on.

36:51.275 --> 36:56.440
- Terri, you gotta be crazy.
- If the A.I.T. is goin' down, Rick, it should go down fighting.

36:56.514 --> 36:59.244
She's right.

36:59.317 --> 37:02.047
If Terri's gonna pull this off,
we're gonna need everybody's help.

37:02.119 --> 37:05.680
Tomorrow morning,
go to the cafe, listen to the C.B.

37:05.756 --> 37:08.657
If we need you,
you guys be ready to roll.

37:13.030 --> 37:16.261
Well, I'll tell ya,
I'll be there.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.735
Anybody who won't be,
raise your hand right now.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.851
Michael, please be careful.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.863
This semi's worth
a king's ransom.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.798
Or a knight's yearly
salary. At the very least.

37:49.867 --> 37:53.496
Hey, where'd you come up
with a name like "Cedric" anyway?

37:53.571 --> 37:57.974
It was my father's name.
Great name.

37:58.042 --> 38:00.033
Good luck, Michael.
KITT's ready and waiting.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.102
Thanks, Bonnie.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.508
Well, I still think you're crazy.

38:08.586 --> 38:11.851
It's hereditary.

38:31.776 --> 38:35.542
Hey, Gil, did you hear the news? Terri
makes a run, the alliance is still alive.

38:35.613 --> 38:37.604
What do you say, Gil,
same deal?

38:37.682 --> 38:41.243
We make that run
and you go to bat for us?

38:41.319 --> 38:43.514
Yeah, okay, that's a deal.

38:43.587 --> 38:46.249
All right.

39:06.777 --> 39:09.177
They're rollin'.

39:09.246 --> 39:11.237
It's black.

39:11.315 --> 39:14.375
All black with gold trim.

39:14.452 --> 39:16.977
No, the car's nowhere in sight.

39:17.054 --> 39:21.457
Just do what it takes!
Get it done!

39:37.675 --> 39:42.408
Oh, Mr. Bagshaw, how about you
and Miss Barstow join us up here?

39:42.480 --> 39:47.179
We'll treat you to a Joe's famous
and original sloppy joe.

39:47.251 --> 39:49.685
Well, um, maybe
if you describe it.

39:49.754 --> 39:52.518
Oh, sure, they're great. Let me
tell you what they got. C'mon.

39:52.590 --> 39:57.084
They got sliced ham, topped
with a special barbecue sauce.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.152
It's got chili, salsa...

39:59.230 --> 40:02.165
and some of the hottest peppers
you ever put in your mouth.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.396
It's a cure for whatever
ails you.

40:05.469 --> 40:09.235
Well, it sounds quite delightful,
but I've just had a large breakfast.

40:09.306 --> 40:11.604
That's the great thing
about these sloppy joes.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.609
Your stomach will make
room for them.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.770
They just won't take "no"
for an answer.

40:15.846 --> 40:20.476
Right. Uh, hey, Norma, how about
bringing us eight sloppy joes over here?

40:24.455 --> 40:26.855
Unless you can handle two.

40:26.924 --> 40:31.020
No! No! I wouldn't want to
overdo a good thing. All right.

40:34.031 --> 40:37.762
Some people are mountain people.
Some are ocean people.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.962
I'm a desert person.
How about you?

40:40.037 --> 40:43.097
I'm a road person all the way.
Me too.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.506
You know what?

40:45.576 --> 40:49.376
The other night was the first time
I ever really wanted to kiss a man.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.745
Come on, I can't believe
that. I didn't say I hadn't,

40:51.816 --> 40:53.977
just that I hadn't
really wanted to.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.349
Okay, that's better. When you
grow up around nothing but men,

40:56.420 --> 40:58.911
you learn certain defenses,

40:58.989 --> 41:01.480
and then you get used to the
defenses and forget they're there...

41:01.559 --> 41:03.823
until something or someone
comes along...

41:03.894 --> 41:07.955
and makes you look at 'em
real close.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.364
Tomboy Terri
is finally retiring, huh?

41:10.434 --> 41:14.768
For good, I think.
You know what?

41:14.839 --> 41:19.037
The last time I wore a dress
was at my high school graduation.

41:19.109 --> 41:24.046
Tell you what...
When this is all over,

41:24.114 --> 41:26.446
you put on
your prettiest dress...

41:26.517 --> 41:29.953
and I'll take you dancing at the Tick Tock
all night long, till the roosters crow.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.803
Yeah, what is it, KITT?

41:55.880 --> 41:58.974
Michael, a tractor with two men
is approaching in the right lane.

41:59.049 --> 42:01.074
One of the men is holding a rifle.

42:12.997 --> 42:15.465
Okay, this is the big one.
Come and get me, buddy.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.024
Right away, Michael.
Who's that?

42:18.102 --> 42:20.229
That's the heavy artillery.

42:35.686 --> 42:37.381
Pull over!

42:38.656 --> 42:40.783
- You ready.
- I was born ready.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.829
All set, Michael.
Be careful.

42:50.901 --> 42:54.598
All right, KITT.
Hold it steady, pal.

42:54.672 --> 42:57.937
Well done.
You too, KITT.

42:58.008 --> 43:01.239
Pull over!

43:06.684 --> 43:09.175
There's that black car.

43:30.007 --> 43:34.637
Michael, my scanners indicate the divided
highway ends less than a mile from here,

43:34.712 --> 43:38.045
and there appears to be very heavy
traffic coming in the opposite direction.

43:38.115 --> 43:42.211
All right, KITT, let's go for it.
We don't have any time to waste.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.813
Look out!

44:23.894 --> 44:26.761
You don't need that.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.890
Okay, who you workin' for?
Gil Riggins.

44:43.947 --> 44:46.381
He's getting away, Michael.

44:49.987 --> 44:52.922
Not a chance, pal.

44:52.990 --> 44:55.754
Let's show 'em what you can do,
huh, buddy?

44:59.963 --> 45:02.523
Whoo!

45:13.010 --> 45:15.672
Just take it easy, Riggins.
It's the end of the line.

45:45.042 --> 45:47.033
Devon!

45:47.111 --> 45:51.480
I'm tellin' you... that was the best sloppy joe
I have ever had in my life. Thank you very much.

45:51.548 --> 45:55.951
Really? Well, in lieu of Chicago pizza,
it was the very least I could do.

45:56.019 --> 45:58.146
By the way, what ever
happened to the stolen cargo?

45:58.222 --> 46:00.213
They ever get it back?
Every piece of it.

46:00.290 --> 46:03.748
It was all tucked away in
one of Riggins's warehouses.

46:03.827 --> 46:09.231
Apparently, Riggins was trying to break
the A.I.T. and set up his own little empire,

46:09.299 --> 46:12.666
control of warehouses
and transportation.

46:12.736 --> 46:14.727
What about Volker?
Where did he fit in?

46:14.805 --> 46:17.273
He didn't. That was the problem.
He was unwanted competition.

46:17.341 --> 46:22.005
Hey, Rick, Terri!

46:28.552 --> 46:31.112
Check it out. I've been
promoted. Check it out.

46:31.188 --> 46:33.383
"Calley Family Garage
and Trucking."

46:33.457 --> 46:35.584
Congratulations.

46:36.593 --> 46:39.426
Help me down?
Helping you down.

46:41.999 --> 46:45.025
Girl can drive an 18-wheeler with
the best of'em and you're helpless.

46:47.171 --> 46:49.935
Hey, Terri. Oh.
Excuse me, guys.

46:50.007 --> 46:52.066
I have a date with the lady
at the Tick Tock.

46:52.142 --> 46:54.269
Until the rooster crows.

46:58.182 --> 47:00.548
Hey.

47:04.121 --> 47:06.146
Sure is pretty.

47:06.223 --> 47:10.182
Maybe if you asked her out like a gentleman,
she could fit you into her social schedule.

47:21.138 --> 47:24.266
Want a nickel beer?
Who's buying?

47:24.341 --> 47:28.402
Big Brother to Hot Knight.

47:28.478 --> 47:30.946
We're gonna tag along
and guess what?

47:31.014 --> 47:33.676
Brusker's buyin'.
If that's okay.

47:33.750 --> 47:37.413
That's okay, Curt.

47:37.487 --> 47:40.115
Michael, the correct response
in C.B. parlance...

47:40.190 --> 47:43.284
would have been, "Breaker,
breaker, Hot Knight to Big Brother.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.419
That's a big 10-4, over and out.

47:45.495 --> 47:50.660
All right, good buddy.
That's a big 10-4. Over and out.
