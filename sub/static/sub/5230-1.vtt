01:18.145 --> 01:21.422
AIR HOSTESS: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Tripoli,

01:21.448 --> 01:23.724
where the time is 8:15pm

01:23.750 --> 01:26.993
and the temperature
is a mild 82 degrees.

01:27.054 --> 01:31.662
We ask you to please be patient with
our security procedures on the ground

01:31.725 --> 01:33.500
and wish you a pleasant evening.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.339
(Exhales heavily)

04:33.406 --> 04:34.942
(High-pitched whistling)

05:14.447 --> 05:17.894
Oh, please, Chuck, none of that.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.857
I'm praying you've got good news for me.
How did it all go?

05:22.889 --> 05:27.565
<i>The mission to assassinate
the Libyan dictator has failed, ma'am.</i>

05:27.627 --> 05:29.129
I'm sorry.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.070
Well, that's it, then.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.204
The last roll of the dice
and it comes up snake eyes.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.806
Thank you for your efforts.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.546
It was always gonna be a long shot,
ma'am.

05:43.076 --> 05:48.424
Now that we have exhausted
your final option, Madam President,

05:48.481 --> 05:50.893
have you made a decision on mine?

05:50.917 --> 05:53.022
I have.

05:54.387 --> 05:58.927
Reluctantly,
and with a most heavy heart,

05:58.992 --> 06:04.408
I am faced with no other option but to
support your position, General Thatcher.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.511
We are going to war.

(Strains)

09:30.070 --> 09:31.606
(Neck cracks)

09:52.959 --> 09:57.271
Fuck it! Fuckin', fuckin' outrageous!

09:57.297 --> 09:59.903
I guess that means no needle.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.744
<i>If only, asshole.</i>

10:03.770 --> 10:07.616
We'd love to see you good and dead
like the innocents you slaughtered.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.280
But your friend has pulled some strings.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.657
I don't have any friends.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.855
Oh, no?

10:17.917 --> 10:21.421
It says here old Ironguts himself
has signed off on your release.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.365
I thought Thatcher was dead.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.027
Well, you thought wrong.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.265
It'll take more than a stroke
to kill that old warrior.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.967
Sign there.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.476
There and there.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.012
He's all yours.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.974
So, Mr Tyler -

11:14.007 --> 11:15.816
Rick -

11:15.842 --> 11:17.344
let's make a deal.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.415
I'm Meredith Baxter,
Senior VP with the network.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.360
Given the circumstances, I won't shake
your hand but consider us well-met.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.886
What is this?

11:25.919 --> 11:30.197
I'm the Executive Producer
of the most successful show on earth

11:30.223 --> 11:32.999
and... you're our new star.

11:34.994 --> 11:38.168
So now, just a quick briefing
and we're ready to play.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.941
Mr Tyler.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.674
Rick.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.876
I'm fucking this puppy -

11:46.906 --> 11:50.513
he's just lifting its tail,
so, stay with me, please.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.624
Turkey Shoot's the game,
and you're the Turkey.

11:55.682 --> 12:00.631
The game has three levels
and hidden in each level is this box.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.633
You have a GPS with its coordinates

12:02.689 --> 12:04.794
and the lock is activated
by your thumbprint.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.394
So, here's the deal.

12:07.427 --> 12:11.807
Locate and open the box within the time
limit, and proceed to the next level.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.470
Run out of time, and you're eliminated.

12:14.534 --> 12:18.641
Open all three boxes...
you win your freedom.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.707
Eliminated?

12:20.740 --> 12:24.813
It sounds a lot nicer than dead,
but that's what we're talking about.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.914
Life and death.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.991
- What the fuck is that?
(Device bleeps)

12:30.049 --> 12:32.962
Just a mild sedative
to introduce a tracking device

12:32.986 --> 12:35.626
so the cameras can always find you.

12:35.655 --> 12:39.159
Level 1 has four shooters,

12:39.225 --> 12:41.899
with double that amount
introduced each level.

12:41.928 --> 12:47.002
Their job is to hunt and kill you -
no prisoners, no mercy.

12:47.066 --> 12:50.479
Of course, you can return the favor.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.411
Any questions?

12:55.908 --> 12:58.149
What if I don't play'?

12:58.177 --> 13:01.317
Then you'll be a sitting duck.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.952
I studied your file, Rick.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.097
You survived combat, suicide missions,

13:10.123 --> 13:14.003
attempts on your life in prison,
even a bullet in the head.

13:15.128 --> 13:19.508
A guy like you...
just isn't wired to give up.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.205
You might even be our first winner.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.615
So... do we have a deal?

13:28.941 --> 13:30.614
What's in the box'?

13:35.014 --> 13:38.484
(Whispers) That's for me to know
and you to find out.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.659
Sleep now.

13:44.791 --> 13:49.240
When you wake... it's game on.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.082

That's right, Tom.

Teena, and playing for a pardon.

14:53.626 --> 14:58.041
Stumbled on the first level,
and didn't that make you happy?

(Cheering and applause)

14:59.699 --> 15:01.372
(Gunshot)

15:05.238 --> 15:08.242
This time,
she met something a lot tougher

15:08.274 --> 15:10.777
than 14 defenceless children, Tom.

15:10.810 --> 15:14.656
That's right. She forgot one of
the golden rules of Turkey Shoot...

15:14.714 --> 15:17.820
(Gunshot)
(Cheering and whooping)

15:17.884 --> 15:20.228

Got yourself a nice little hide-out.

You've gone soft, Llewyn. And stupid.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.636
It's 'Ramrod' now.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.740
What kind of fuckin' name is that'?

26:15.374 --> 26:16.978
That's cheating.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.250
That's the perks for being number one.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.621
Plus they really want you dead.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.322
They'?

Thatcher?

26:28.620 --> 26:30.600
Even if I knew...

26:31.924 --> 26:33.961
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.131
That's not very righteous.

The killer of women and children.

26:54.813 --> 26:56.622
Isn't that what you said at my trial?

26:56.648 --> 26:58.594
At least you remember that.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.653
They shoulda offed you in the brig.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.861
They tried - they died.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.925
Don't do it.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.872
I can tell you things
you don't remember.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.805
You didn't kill those kids.

27:13.165 --> 27:16.339
The massacre - you were framed.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.972
AUTOMATED VOICE: One minute remaining.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.281
59, 58...

27:22.307 --> 27:23.945
You're not going to make it, SEAL.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.478

27:25.511 --> 27:27.457
- I'll see you on the next level.

28:40.118 --> 28:43.122
(Woman speaks indistinctly over PA)

28:47.359 --> 28:49.270
At ease, Commander.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.938
Did you bring it?

29:07.946 --> 29:09.983
Bunch of Nazis in this place.

29:10.048 --> 29:12.085
It is a hospital, sir.

29:12.117 --> 29:16.259
It's a filthy habit,
but when your days are numbered,

29:16.288 --> 29:19.895
you have to do what you want,
whatever the consequences.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.798
Did you watch it'?

29:24.830 --> 29:26.776
Yes, sir.

29:26.798 --> 29:29.404
I thought he looked good, considering.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.582
I didn't recognise Sergeant Llewyn.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.175
Ramrod?

29:37.643 --> 29:40.089
He's different since the trial.

29:40.112 --> 29:44.151
Profiting from death changes a person.

29:46.351 --> 29:49.457
So, you know we're sending in
a team to finish the job'?

29:49.488 --> 29:51.263
Yes, sir.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.798
I want you to pilot the chopper.

29:56.094 --> 29:59.473
Now, we both know that
Commander Tyler is a good soldier

29:59.498 --> 30:02.638
who would never divulge
classified intelligence,

30:02.668 --> 30:07.879
but my colleagues consider him a
loose end - and loose ends come undone.

30:09.174 --> 30:14.487
Commander... it is imperative
to the security of this nation

30:14.513 --> 30:16.515
that Rick Tyler be silenced.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.186
I can't tell you any more

30:18.216 --> 30:21.163
but know this position
is unanimous across command

30:21.186 --> 30:24.190
and goes right to the very top.

30:24.222 --> 30:25.724
Do you read me?

30:25.791 --> 30:27.464
In triplicate, sir.

30:30.629 --> 30:33.132
He should have died in that massacre.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.139
But if you want a clusterfuck,
send in the Marines.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.509
I don't understand, sir.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.985
What's not to understand, Commander?

30:45.010 --> 30:47.752
We framed Rick Tyler.

30:52.984 --> 30:56.727
â™ª [EERIE MUSIC]

31:15.607 --> 31:18.383
It's a cocktail
of vitamins and antibiotics.

31:18.410 --> 31:23.519
It's cheating, I know, but I want you
to give Level <i>2</i> your best shot.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.420
How do you feel?

31:27.452 --> 31:29.295
Water.

31:35.861 --> 31:40.367
Decapitation, self-surgery,
that thing with the arrow -

31:40.399 --> 31:43.573
Game 177, so far, so amazing.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.047
The audience like you.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.244
No-one's retired
this many shooters before.

31:48.273 --> 31:51.811
You've even been voted a classic-kill
and you're not even halfway through.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.823
You haven't seen anything yet.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.620
Really?

31:56.648 --> 32:00.118
When I get Llewyn on the next level,
make sure all cameras are pointed at us.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.496
Ramrod.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.500

you didn't kill those children.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.259
Found out?

48:46.290 --> 48:48.668
Thatcher told me
you were framed for the massacre.

48:50.728 --> 48:52.264
He told you'?

48:52.296 --> 48:54.276
The question is, why'?

48:54.298 --> 48:56.073
Why were you framed'?

48:58.335 --> 49:01.179
Hey, I just ruined
a brilliant career for you, asshole.

49:01.238 --> 49:02.945
You owe me an answer.

49:05.242 --> 49:06.812
Tell me.

49:09.980 --> 49:11.516
Hick?

49:13.651 --> 49:16.962
I assassinated the Libyan dictator
two weeks before the invasion.

49:18.789 --> 49:21.133
A black op, on the President's orders.

49:21.158 --> 49:23.263
Her last-ditch effort to avoid war.

49:27.031 --> 49:28.669
(Tyres screech)

49:30.167 --> 49:31.669
He's dead'?

49:31.702 --> 49:33.704
I watched his head explode.

49:34.805 --> 49:38.275
But the Libyans put in a double,
like we knew they would.

49:38.309 --> 49:41.779
But the Generals told the President
that my mission was a failure.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.655
Thatcher wanted war.

49:43.681 --> 49:45.524
And you're the loose end.

49:47.551 --> 49:50.122
The only one besides them
who knows the truth.

49:50.154 --> 49:51.792
I can't believe it.

49:51.822 --> 49:56.202
This whole shitty war is about
killing someone who's already dead.

49:57.828 --> 50:00.809
- Why didn't you try and say something?
- I didn't have any proof.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.573
- But at your trial you could've...
- Who would you believe?

50:03.634 --> 50:05.739
A psychopathic killer
of women and children,

50:05.803 --> 50:07.840
or four-star generals?

50:14.478 --> 50:16.549
We've got to deal with
that tracking device

50:16.580 --> 50:18.685
or we'll never even
make it out of the county.

50:23.854 --> 50:27.700
(Echoing shouts and screams)

50:40.104 --> 50:41.708
Wrap this around you.

50:52.082 --> 50:53.720
Will this work'?

50:53.751 --> 50:58.461
If it doesn't, it's been nice
seeing you again, Commander.

50:58.522 --> 51:00.297
Likewise, Commander.

51:03.127 --> 51:04.970
Sorry I got angry before.

51:05.029 --> 51:06.872
It's a lot to take in.

51:08.132 --> 51:09.702
Somethings still bothering me.

51:10.768 --> 51:13.044
Why did Thatcher tell you
I was innocent?

51:14.104 --> 51:16.448
He never does anything without a reason.

51:17.942 --> 51:20.548
I'll be sure to ask him,
right before I kill him.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.650
Go back to sleep
while I find us a motel.

51:26.617 --> 51:29.097
Whatever happens, thank you.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.494
You're welcome, Rick.

51:58.248 --> 52:02.287
I don't care if his tumor
is having a triple fucking bypass,

52:02.319 --> 52:05.095
you tell his people
if I don't speak with General Thatcher

52:05.122 --> 52:09.093
in the next 15 minutes,
he's gonna wish he was dead.

52:14.865 --> 52:16.367

GENERAL THATCHER, ON PHONE:
Good morning, Meredith.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.678
Where is he, General?

52:26.710 --> 52:28.519
I'm not too bad, thank you for asking.

52:28.545 --> 52:31.719
Don't fuck with me, Thatcher.
Where's my Turkey?

52:31.782 --> 52:34.558
Calm down, Meredith,
I've got my best people on it.

52:34.618 --> 52:38.191
Don't patronise me, you asshole.
I know you're behind this.

52:38.222 --> 52:39.826
I thought we had a deal.

52:39.857 --> 52:42.736
I had nothing to do with it.
One of my people went rogue.

52:42.793 --> 52:44.363
These things happen.

52:44.395 --> 52:47.706
This is television, Chuck,
nothing happens on television -

52:47.731 --> 52:49.369
not on my network.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.074
We'll find him, Meredith.
You have my word on that.

52:52.136 --> 52:54.844
If I don't get him back
within the next 12 hours, General,

52:54.872 --> 52:57.375
that cancer of yours
is going to have to get in line,

52:57.408 --> 52:59.410
because I will fucking bury you.

Keep moving, soldier.

Roll over.

(Device clicks)

55:06.036 --> 55:07.538
Anything there?

55:08.705 --> 55:10.343
Not that I know of.

55:12.976 --> 55:14.546
Found it.

55:28.992 --> 55:31.404
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

55:31.461 --> 55:34.067
This is gonna hurt you
a lot more than me.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.638
Oh, fuck!

55:46.310 --> 55:47.812
Gotcha.

55:54.351 --> 55:56.661
(Device crunches)

55:59.489 --> 56:01.059
Now...

56:05.062 --> 56:06.564
hold still.

56:14.538 --> 56:18.953
(Echoing shouts and screams)

56:30.888 --> 56:36.304
32 seconds - you manipulate it
well, my dear, like part of your body.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.237
It is my own design.

56:38.262 --> 56:40.640
Yes, a very nice piece. Mm.

56:40.697 --> 56:42.699
And what did you bring
for the hunt, Tito?

56:42.733 --> 56:44.371
Something excessive, I imagine.

56:44.401 --> 56:45.971
Of course, my dear.

56:46.036 --> 56:51.952
After all, excess is what makes
life worth living for people like us.

56:51.975 --> 56:54.046
If I had more men like you
in the department,

56:54.077 --> 56:57.149
I wouldn't have all these problems
with these blasted deviants.

56:57.214 --> 57:01.162
MAN, ON TV': Yes, sir. Kill 'em.
No fancy stuff - just kill 'em all.

57:01.218 --> 57:03.664
- What took you so long?
TITO: The ultimate solution.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.791
Food, clothes.
- You're a sharp man.

57:07.057 --> 57:08.627
And I got us a car.

57:08.659 --> 57:11.799
MAN, ON TV: Anything you want, sir,
just let me know.

57:11.828 --> 57:13.330
TITO: Hitler...

57:13.397 --> 57:14.899
Are you having any?

57:14.932 --> 57:16.468
I'm gonna take a shower.

57:16.500 --> 57:20.141
It's an amazing twist
in an amazing game, Tom.

57:20.170 --> 57:24.414
You said it, Teena.
The Turkey's gone and the hunt is on!

57:24.441 --> 57:28.617
And just who is this mysterious
blonde bombshell helping him?

57:28.645 --> 57:32.149
ANNOUNCER: She's been identified
as Commander Jillian Wilson,

57:32.182 --> 57:37.188
a fellow Navy SEAL and an ace
chopper pilot - as if we didn't know!

57:37.254 --> 57:39.461
And check the live stats, people.

57:39.489 --> 57:41.469
(Cheering and applause)

57:41.491 --> 57:44.631
Rick Tyler's approval rating
is off the charts.

57:44.661 --> 57:46.163
Wow!

57:46.196 --> 57:49.143
You guys are really liking this Turkey.

57:49.166 --> 57:52.841
We all love a man
who can take charge, Tom.

57:52.869 --> 57:55.713
ANNOUNCER: But let's not forget
what Rick Tyler is, Teena -

57:55.772 --> 57:58.810
a cold-blooded killer
of innocent women and children.

57:58.842 --> 58:02.813
Even battle-hardened veterans
were shocked by the insane bloodlust

58:02.846 --> 58:07.317
exhibited in one of the worst rogue
killing sprees ever seen in combat.

58:07.351 --> 58:11.390
That single act of merciless carnage,
perpetrated against unarmed...

58:17.394 --> 58:20.204
For three years,
I thought that fuck was me.

58:22.666 --> 58:26.546
I remember the kids, the village
and waking up in a hospital in Germany.

58:29.840 --> 58:34.585
I can't remember the massacre.
But I knew I was guilty.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.555
Now you know the truth.

58:41.051 --> 58:42.758
Being innocent doesn't matter.

58:43.854 --> 58:45.527
Knowing you can do it...

58:47.190 --> 58:50.171
I've killed a lot of people, Jill,
and felt nothing.

59:06.910 --> 59:08.514
Maybe I don't have a heart.

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:14.512
RICK: Which hospital is he in'?

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:16.580
JILL: There is no way
I'm taking you there.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.593
The place will be crawling
with security.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.754
RICK: That's never stopped me before.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:23.162
JILL: Don't be crazy.
Thatcher's not worth it.

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:25.188
RICK: I wanna see him.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:28.429
I mean it, Rick, it's too dangerous.
Just forget the General.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.994
Let's disappear.

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.267
You realise he's planned
this whole thing.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.037
- He wants me to get to him.
- Bullshit.

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.305
He knows you, Jill, and he knows me.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.007
He knew you'd do something.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.639
He's crippled and helpless.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.651
You know what that means for
a guy like him? He's already in hell.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.846
Killing him is just doing him a favor.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:48.550
I'm not gonna kill him -
it's not about revenge anymore.

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:50.285
Then what's it about?

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.020
I don't know.

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.823

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.390

NEWSREADER: Breaking news this hour.
I'm Pete Sanchez.

Chaos in the downtown tunnels
as authorities pursue a high-speed chase

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:52.015
causing a score of pile-ups
and creating gridlock across the city.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.544
Police say the vehicle,

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:57.354
believed to contain the mass murderer
whose dramatic escape from Turkey Shoot

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.882
has amazed the world,

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.225
has been lost
in the serpentine transit system.

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:04.596
Crossing now to the network's
eye in the sky for live developments.

01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:06.123
Here's Gina Jones.

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:07.691
GINA JONES: Thanks, Pete.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.933
The network can report
that the chase is back on,

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:13.635
after the
pale-or white-colored vehicle,

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:18.908
believed to contain escaped Turkey
Rick Tyler and his beautiful accomplice,

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:22.747
dramatically reappeared at the L21 exit.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:28.255

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:38.092
WOMAN, OVER PA: Dr Schwartz,
please report to Oncology.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:43.161
REPORTER: SEAL Commander
Jillian Wilson surrendered to police

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:44.933
after a crash ended the chase.

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:48.340
But the convicted mass murderer
remains at large this hour,

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:50.844
as a manhunt continues downtown.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.437
It is believed
Turkey Shoot escapee Rick Tyler

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.973
exited somewhere
in the cover of the tunnel system

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.418
when the vehicle was lost
for over 20 minutes.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.284
- Authorities...

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.794
I've been expecting you, son.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.801
I know. Why'?

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.865
Can't a dying old man say he's sorry?

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:19.497
Fuck you.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:25.045
<i>The President's mission was impossible.
You were meant to fail.</i>

01:03:27.604 --> 01:03:32.178
I cannot let World War Africa
be my legacy.

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:35.155
It has got to end.

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:37.215
And here you are.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.525
We buried your mission, Commander,
but we couldn't bury you.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:44.395
You're too good a soldier.

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:53.665
I have got the blood of millions
on my hands.

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:57.474
I'd like the chance
to wash a little of it off.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.037
I'm sending you
on one last mission, soldier.

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.812
What the fuck makes you think
I'd do anything for you?

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:08.255
Because you can end this war
and you can clear your name.

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:15.554
Unit 226, rails bag storage downtown.

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:18.691
Three years ago,
I stashed a little insurance policy

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:20.929
and now it's time to cash it in.

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.594
I'd do it myself,

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:26.835
but you know as well as I do
I'm not gonna leave this room alive.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.871
Hubris, Commander.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.211
I went to bed
the most powerful man in the country

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.877
and woke up wearing a fuckin' diaper.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:43.923
Don't worry - I can't feel it.

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:45.551
I'm not worried.

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.358
The lock is thumbprint activated.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:52.800
And inside that unit is the truth to
bring down the whole stinking mess.

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:57.771
But you have got to get it to the
right people - people who won't bury it.

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.906
Would you do me the honor, son'?

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.572
It'd be righteous coming from you.

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:09.082
It'd be righteous coming from you.

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.612
I started a war
that has become a monster.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.386
You have to end it.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.086
That's an order.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.639

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.845
(Bleep!)

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:28.617
I told you, no calls.

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:31.454
MAN: I have the President
of the network, ma'am.

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.016
Put him through.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.687
(Bleep!)

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:37.596
Jeremy! How are you'?

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.191
JEREMY, ON PHONE:
I don't know, Meredith. You tell me.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:43.466
Well, the Chinese were very receptive,
like we knew they would be.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.597
I'm talking about Turkey Shoot.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.475
You've seen the numbers?

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:53.036
Through the roof. Congratulations.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:59.151
I must say, it really was a masterstroke
on your part staging that escape.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:02.451
That blonde chopper pilot - genius.

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:05.288
Thank you, sir. It's all going to plan.

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:06.817
Really?

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:10.057
Because I just got off the line
to the Joint Chiefs.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.293
It appears our friend
is no longer with us.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:14.563
Thatcher committed suicide an hour ago.

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:19.638
I hope the rats
aren't deserting the ship, Meredith.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.768
His illness was weighing heavy
upon him, sir.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.779
He knew there was no hope.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.611
Warriors make bad invalids.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.639
But they make good Turkeys, sir.

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:33.313
And Rick Tyler is about to take
this network to a whole new level.

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:35.845
Well, I can't argue
with the stats, Meredith.

01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:39.917
Hell, even the afternoon news
is getting a bump from this guy.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.587
When the numbers plateau,

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:44.599
we'll stage his recapture
and then we'll go to Level 3.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.261
It's going to be
history in the making, sir.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.361
So, everything's under control?

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:52.167
Absolutely. No question.

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:54.801
Then keep up the good work, Meredith.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:57.107
I'll have my girl set up a dinner.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.703
Thank you, sir.

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:10.682
MAN: I have your PA, ma'am.

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:12.215

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.886
PA, ON PHONE: The police
cornered him downtown, ma'am.

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.898
Yes?

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.627
They got him.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.158
And?

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:22.965
He's been shot.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:31.711
PETE SANCHEZ: Breaking news this hour.
I'm Pete Sanchez.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:34.840
The past Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,
General Charles Thatcher,

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.747
has died at Madigan Memorial Hospital.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:40.379
The network can reveal the <i>cause</i>
of death is a single gunshot wound.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.651
No further details
are available at this time,

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.421
but the President scheduled
a hasty press conference.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:50.157
For those of you who say
World War Africa has gone on too long,

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:54.999
I say to you, liberation day is near!

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:58.403

Bravo, Rick.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.084
Exceptional.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:23.723
That buzzing in your head's the taser,
but it'll fade.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:25.391
What's going on?

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:27.298
You mean what's going up?

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.369
The ratings, mister.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:36.400

the fastest trending show in TV history.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.469
<i>You're a bona fide superstar.</i>

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:41.606

we're going to give you Level 2.

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.310
Wilson?

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.579
She's in jail.

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:48.589
But she's OK... for now.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.724
So... Mr Tyler,

and, I promise you,
I will make them throw away the key.

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:37.671
Or... I can make it all
go away just like that.

All you gotta do is play.

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:47.347
She helped you, Rick, have a heart.

He didn't massacre

In fact, he tried to save them.

01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:59.044
He shouldn't be in prison.
He's innocent.

And we'll be there

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.198
Correct, ma'am.

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:37.898
OK, then. Do your duty.

Hand over your weapon

Stay out of this, Jill.

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:01.391
It's a civilian risk, soldier,
stand down.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.260

Bringing you this GCN exclusive.

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:32.953
The architect of World War Africa
confesses from beyond the grave.

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:36.690
Will it bring down the administration?
And could it stop the war?

01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:38.959
You're listening to a dead man.

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:41.194
Ironguts!

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:44.863
And whatever you may have been
led to believe, I took my own life,

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:50.138
with a gun that has served me well
in Afghanistan, Korea <i>ll</i>

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:53.374
and numerous other theaters of war.

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:59.386
Simply put, I did it because I couldn't
stomach the secrets and lies any longer.

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:08.484
Three years ago, our best marksman
killed the Libyan dictator

01:23:08.517 --> 01:23:11.191
on a mission ordered by the President.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.666
Holy shit!

01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:17.159
We told the President
the mission had failed

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:21.231
in order to perpetuate a conflict

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:25.802
that has now become
the terrible humanitarian catastrophe

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.872
known as World War Africa.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:39.240
And we framed the brave, honorable
soldier who pulled the trigger -

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:42.520
Navy SEAL Commander Rick Tyler.

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:48.435
We imprisoned him
for a crime he did not commit.

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:51.498
Here's the truth.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.336

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.069
(People scream)

01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:58.601
(indistinct shouting)
SOLDIER: Back up, SEAL! Back up!

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.047
RAMROD: Take them out!

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:29.132
Jesus Christ!

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.938
Isn't that our hero'?

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:37.048
GENERAL THATCHER:
You're listening to a dead man.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.745
Not anymore.

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:42.051
We told the President
the mission had failed

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.149
in order to perpetuate a conflict...

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:48.751
(Newsreaders speak at once)

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:53.229
So, Commander Tyler...

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.299
"Hick."

01:24:56.325 --> 01:24:58.396
Let's make a deal.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:01.135
GENERAL THATCHER:
..soldier who pulled the trigger...

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:04.804
Here's the truth...
Navy SEAL Commander Rick Tyler...

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:09.911
We imprisoned him
for a crime he did not commit...

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.645
the truth... Here's the truth...

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:14.745
(Overlapping dialogue)

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:17.984
Here's the truth...

01:25:18.305 --> 01:25:24.275
