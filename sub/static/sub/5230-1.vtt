01:23.750 --> 01:26.993
and the temperature
is a mild 82 degrees.

01:27.054 --> 01:31.662
We ask you to please be patient with

05:14.447 --> 05:17.894
Oh, please, Chuck, none of that.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.857
I'm praying you've got good news for me.
How did it all go?

05:22.889 --> 05:27.565
<i>The mission to assassinate
the Libyan dictator has failed, ma'am.</i>

05:27.627 --> 05:29.129
I'm sorry.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.070
Well, that's it, then.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.204
The last roll of the dice
and it comes up snake eyes.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.806
Thank you for your efforts.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.546
It was always gonna be a long shot,
ma'am.

05:43.076 --> 05:48.424
Now that we have exhausted
your final option, Madam President,

05:48.481 --> 05:50.893
have you made a decision on mine?

05:50.917 --> 05:53.022
I have.

05:54.387 --> 05:58.927
Reluctantly,
and with a most heavy heart,

05:58.992 --> 06:04.408
I am faced with no other option but to
support your position, General Thatcher.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.616
We'd love to see you good and dead
like the innocents you slaughtered.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.280
But your friend has pulled some strings.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.657
I don't have any friends.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.855
Oh, no?

10:17.917 --> 10:21.421
It says here old Ironguts himself
has signed off on your release.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.365
I thought Thatcher was dead.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.027
Well, you thought wrong.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.265
It'll take more than a stroke
to kill that old warrior.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.967
Sign there.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.476
There and there.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.012
He's all yours.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.974
So, Mr Tyler -

11:14.007 --> 11:15.816
Rick -

11:15.842 --> 11:17.344
let's make a deal.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.415
I'm Meredith Baxter,
Senior VP with the network.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.360
Given the circumstances, I won't shake
your hand but consider us well-met.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.886
What is this?

11:25.919 --> 11:30.197
I'm the Executive Producer
of the most successful show on earth

11:30.223 --> 11:32.999
and... you're our new star.

11:34.994 --> 11:38.168
So now, just a quick briefing
and we're ready to play.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.941
Mr Tyler.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.674
Rick.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.876
I'm fucking this puppy -

11:46.906 --> 11:50.513
he's just lifting its tail,
so, stay with me, please.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.624
Turkey Shoot's the game,
and you're the Turkey.

11:55.682 --> 12:00.631
The game has three levels
and hidden in each level is this box.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.633
You have a GPS with its coordinates

12:02.689 --> 12:04.794
and the lock is activated
by your thumbprint.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.394
So, here's the deal.

12:07.427 --> 12:11.807
Locate and open the box within the time
limit, and proceed to the next level.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.470
Run out of time, and you're eliminated.

12:14.534 --> 12:18.641
Open all three boxes...
you win your freedom.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.707
Eliminated?

12:20.740 --> 12:24.813
It sounds a lot nicer than dead,
but that's what we're talking about.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.914
Life and death.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.991
- What the fuck is that?
(Device bleeps)

12:30.049 --> 12:32.962
Just a mild sedative
to introduce a tracking device

12:32.986 --> 12:35.626
so the cameras can always find you.

12:35.655 --> 12:39.159
Level 1 has four shooters,

12:39.225 --> 12:41.899
with double that amount
introduced each level.

12:41.928 --> 12:47.002
Their job is to hunt and kill you -
no prisoners, no mercy.

12:47.066 --> 12:50.479
Of course, you can return the favor.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.411
Any questions?

12:55.908 --> 12:58.149
What if I don't play'?

12:58.177 --> 13:01.317
Then you'll be a sitting duck.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.952
I studied your file, Rick.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.097
You survived combat, suicide missions,

13:10.123 --> 13:14.003
attempts on your life in prison,
even a bullet in the head.

13:15.128 --> 13:19.508
A guy like you...
just isn't wired to give up.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.205
You might even be our first winner.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.615
So... do we have a deal?

13:28.941 --> 13:30.614
What's in the box'?

13:35.014 --> 13:38.484
(Whispers) That's for me to know
and you to find out.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.659

This time,
she met something a lot tougher

15:08.274 --> 15:10.777
than 14 defenceless children, Tom.

15:10.810 --> 15:14.656
That's right. She forgot one of

What kind of fuckin' name is that'?

26:15.374 --> 26:16.978
That's cheating.

At least you remember that.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.653
They shoulda offed you in the brig.

29:07.946 --> 29:09.983
Bunch of Nazis in this place.

29:10.048 --> 29:12.085

He's different since the trial.

29:40.112 --> 29:44.151

29:56.094 --> 29:59.473
Now, we both know that
Commander Tyler is a good soldier

29:59.498 --> 30:02.638
who would never divulge
classified intelligence,

30:02.668 --> 30:07.879
but my colleagues consider him a
loose end - and loose ends come undone.

30:09.174 --> 30:14.487
Commander... it is imperative
to the security of this nation

30:14.513 --> 30:16.515

30:16.548 --> 30:18.186
I can't tell you any more

Do you read me?

30:25.791 --> 30:27.464
In triplicate, sir.

30:30.629 --> 30:33.132
He should have died in that massacre.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.139
But if you want a clusterfuck,
send in the Marines.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.509
I don't understand, sir.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.985
What's not to understand, Commander?

48:46.290 --> 48:48.668
Thatcher told me
you were framed for the massacre.

48:50.728 --> 48:52.264
He told you'?

48:52.296 --> 48:54.276
The question is, why'?

48:54.298 --> 48:56.073
Why were you framed'?

48:58.335 --> 49:01.179
Hey, I just ruined
a brilliant career for you, asshole.

49:01.238 --> 49:02.945
You owe me an answer.

49:05.242 --> 49:06.812
Tell me.

49:09.980 --> 49:11.516
Hick?

49:13.651 --> 49:16.962
I assassinated the Libyan dictator
two weeks before the invasion.

(Tyres screech)

49:30.167 --> 49:31.669
He's dead'?

49:31.702 --> 49:33.704
I watched his head explode.

49:34.805 --> 49:38.275
But the Libyans put in a double,
like we knew they would.

49:38.309 --> 49:41.779
But the Generals told the President
that my mission was a failure.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.655
Thatcher wanted war.

49:43.681 --> 49:45.524

who knows the truth.

49:50.154 --> 49:51.792
I can't believe it.

This whole shitty war is about
killing someone who's already dead.

49:57.828 --> 50:00.809
- Why didn't you try and say something?
- I didn't have any proof.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.573

- Who would you believe?

50:03.634 --> 50:05.739
A psychopathic killer
of women and children,

50:05.803 --> 50:07.840
or four-star generals?

50:14.478 --> 50:16.549
We've got to deal with
that tracking device

I'm taking you there.

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.267
You realise he's planned
this whole thing.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.037
- He wants me to get to him.
- Bullshit.

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.305
He knows you, Jill, and he knows me.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.007
He knew you'd do something.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.639
He's crippled and helpless.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.651
You know what that means for
a guy like him? He's already in hell.

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.846
Killing him is just doing him a favor.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:48.550
I'm not gonna kill him -
it's not about revenge anymore.

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:50.285

Would you do me the honor, son'?

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.572
It'd be righteous coming from you.

It'd be righteous coming from you.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.386

(People scream)

01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:58.601
(indistinct shouting)
SOLDIER: Back up, SEAL! Back up!

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.047
RAMROD: Take them out!

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:29.132
Jesus Christ!

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.938
Isn't that our hero'?

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:37.048
GENERAL THATCHER:
You're listening to a dead man.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.745
Not anymore.

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:42.051
We told the President
the mission had failed

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.149
in order to perpetuate a conflict...

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:48.751
(Newsreaders speak at once)

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:53.229
So, Commander Tyler...

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.299
"Hick."

01:24:56.325 --> 01:24:58.396
Let's make a deal.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:01.135
GENERAL THATCHER:
..soldier who pulled the trigger...

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:04.804
Here's the truth...
Navy SEAL Commander Rick Tyler...

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:09.911
We imprisoned him
for a crime he did not commit...

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.645
the truth... Here's the truth...

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:14.745
(Overlapping dialogue)

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:17.984
Here's the truth...

01:25:18.305 --> 01:25:24.275
