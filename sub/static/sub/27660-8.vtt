WEBVTT

00:04.216 --> 00:06.219
Previously
on "Future Man"...

00:06.220 --> 00:08.724
Who's there?
You made a family here.

00:08.725 --> 00:11.270
You'll always have a place
at our Sunday table.

00:12.858 --> 00:13.943
You need to move up the launch.

00:13.944 --> 00:15.487
Yeah, you're right,

00:15.488 --> 00:17.199
but I need more time
to explain it to her.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.536
I've lost her once.
I don't wanna lose her again.

00:18.537 --> 00:20.706
- Holy shit.
- You're a Biotic.

00:20.707 --> 00:22.251
After everything
we've been through.

00:22.252 --> 00:25.173
At least I have someone else.
Who do you have?

00:35.111 --> 00:37.072
Come on.

00:37.073 --> 00:38.617
Come on.
I know you're in there.

00:38.618 --> 00:40.580
You gotta be in there.

00:40.581 --> 00:41.873
Come on.

00:41.874 --> 00:43.711
Oh, God.

00:43.712 --> 00:45.923
Torq-ie,
where are you going?

00:45.924 --> 00:47.217
Gotta go feed the stray.

00:47.218 --> 00:49.388
Be careful.
He's filthy.

00:51.561 --> 00:52.980
Chow time.

00:54.859 --> 00:57.195
I snuck some wild nettles
in her for you.

00:57.196 --> 00:59.033
Should deepen
the flavor profile.

00:59.034 --> 01:01.621
Let's get this off you.

01:01.622 --> 01:03.291
Mm-hmm.

01:03.292 --> 01:05.505
And easy on the nose.

01:06.716 --> 01:07.884
How you holding up there,
buddy?

01:07.885 --> 01:09.219
Oh, yeah, you know, uh,

01:09.220 --> 01:10.681
well, I didn't sleep
last night,

01:10.682 --> 01:12.351
but I actually
still had nightmares...

01:12.352 --> 01:14.689
So I, you know,
that's a good thing.

01:14.690 --> 01:16.818
And then, uh, you know--
you know about the scorpions.

01:16.819 --> 01:18.488
Bunch of 'em around here,
so I kind of

01:18.489 --> 01:19.991
spent some of the afternoon
fighting those guys off.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.536
So what's--
what's the plan, Wolf?

01:21.537 --> 01:23.916
I'm gonna establish
the rule of law.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.420
Uh, respect
for our shared humanity,

01:26.421 --> 01:28.634
get us back
on the Gregorian calendar.

01:28.635 --> 01:30.721
Did you know today is
the eleventy-twelfth

01:30.722 --> 01:32.684
of the Quetzalcoatl?

01:32.685 --> 01:34.688
What does that even mean?

01:34.689 --> 01:36.775
The attack, Wolf.

01:36.776 --> 01:38.821
The attack that's happening
on Launch Day.

01:38.822 --> 01:40.115
The one that
we should be out there

01:40.116 --> 01:41.535
actively trying to stop
right now

01:41.536 --> 01:44.666
instead of being here
locked in this...

01:44.667 --> 01:47.212
Where's Tiger?

01:47.213 --> 01:49.216
Yeah, about that.

01:49.217 --> 01:50.803
I'm not gonna be able
to eat my bean mush.

01:50.804 --> 01:53.643
Yeah, maybe later.
Yeah.

01:54.812 --> 01:56.982
Tiger's a Biotic, we're never
gonna see her again,

01:56.983 --> 01:59.529
the TTD's destroyed, so we're
stuck in this timeline forever.

01:59.530 --> 02:01.241
Okay, good talk.

02:02.076 --> 02:04.079
What the fuck?

02:10.342 --> 02:12.387
It filters out carbon monoxide,

02:12.388 --> 02:16.730
argon, methane, sulfur dioxide,
boron trichloride,

02:16.731 --> 02:18.776
and it's so versatile
and stylish,

02:18.777 --> 02:21.280
you can wear it whether you're
fixing radiation shields

02:21.281 --> 02:22.700
in the Schiaparelli Crater

02:22.701 --> 02:25.038
or kite-boarding
in the Valles Marineris.

02:25.039 --> 02:27.250
Imagine clean,
purified air

02:27.251 --> 02:31.091
prepackaged in this beautiful
24-karat gold inlaid mask

02:31.092 --> 02:33.262
with a stainless steel
breathing apparatus.

02:33.263 --> 02:34.974
Finally,
you don't have to choose

02:34.975 --> 02:37.522
between looking good
and breathing.

02:40.612 --> 02:43.242
Next up, grav boots.

02:52.051 --> 02:54.764
Oh.
Oh, hi.

02:54.765 --> 02:57.854
Sorry, hope my battle-roping
didn't wake you.

02:57.855 --> 02:59.983
So, um...

02:59.984 --> 03:01.443
are you okay?

03:01.444 --> 03:02.822
I will be
if you have any more

03:02.823 --> 03:04.909
of this 'Sorb kicking around.

03:06.454 --> 03:10.378
Tiger, that is a class-four
medicinal opiate.

03:10.379 --> 03:12.173
Anything more than
an eyedropper is considered--

03:12.174 --> 03:14.638
- Not enough.
- Not enough.

03:15.724 --> 03:19.396
I'm really not trying
to pry here...

03:19.397 --> 03:21.526
I'm just concerned.

03:21.527 --> 03:23.321
I'm fine.

03:23.322 --> 03:25.784
Come on, Tiger.

03:25.785 --> 03:27.705
You slept 16 hours last night,

03:27.706 --> 03:30.794
you spent 80,000 ethereum
on bedazzled respirators,

03:30.795 --> 03:33.215
and there's a full slice
of cheese stuck to your robe.

03:33.216 --> 03:35.513
Ah,
that's where she went.

03:36.641 --> 03:38.100
And Dr. Ahmadi
has always told me

03:38.101 --> 03:39.604
that when you're upset,

03:39.605 --> 03:41.273
the worst thing you can do
is hold it in.

03:41.274 --> 03:43.862
Wrong. That's the best thing
you can do.

03:43.863 --> 03:46.785
You trap the pain,
you crush it inside you,

03:46.786 --> 03:49.707
and the juice that drips out,
it's your fuel.

03:49.708 --> 03:51.168
Tiger, come on.

03:51.169 --> 03:52.880
Talk to me.

03:52.881 --> 03:55.594
I'm not just a supercomputer.

03:55.595 --> 03:57.430
- I'm super-listener.
- Fine, Stu.

03:57.431 --> 04:00.019
You wanna know what's wrong?
Okay.

04:00.020 --> 04:03.442
My life?
It's in the shit sizzler.

04:03.443 --> 04:06.866
My time machine's busted,
my doppelganger sucks,

04:06.867 --> 04:09.580
I'm a fucking Biotic,
and to top it all off,

04:09.581 --> 04:13.254
the one guy I thought I could
count on in this timeline...

04:13.255 --> 04:14.339
he hates me.

04:14.340 --> 04:16.343
So...

04:16.344 --> 04:18.765
you got anymore of this stuff?

04:18.766 --> 04:20.644
What if I told you I had
something better than 'Sorb?

04:20.645 --> 04:23.066
- Smack?
- Better.

04:26.114 --> 04:28.034
Okay.

04:31.332 --> 04:33.795
What is this?

04:33.796 --> 04:35.591
Some kind of weird hat?

04:35.592 --> 04:37.343
It's not a hat.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.431
You remember
when you first came here

04:39.432 --> 04:41.770
and I told you that
bodies were just shells?

04:41.771 --> 04:43.982
No, not really.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.320
- Okay.
- Well, this device,

04:46.321 --> 04:49.284
it allows you
to throw your shell away,

04:49.285 --> 04:51.623
and allows you
to throw everything away

04:51.624 --> 04:53.543
and become whatever you desire.

04:53.544 --> 04:54.837
Okay,
you're sounding a lot like

04:54.838 --> 04:56.800
the Riddle Gnome
of Bonesaw Bridge.

04:56.801 --> 04:59.722
We--we killed him
for not speaking directly.

04:59.723 --> 05:01.726
- Okay.
- You--you say that

05:01.727 --> 05:03.312
your life is
on the shit sizzler.

05:03.313 --> 05:04.690
In. In--in the sh--
in the shit sizzler.

05:04.691 --> 05:06.151
I would like to posit

05:06.152 --> 05:09.407
that you only perceive it
to be sizzling.

05:09.408 --> 05:10.537
What do you have to lose?

05:12.624 --> 05:13.959
Okay.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.213
So I-I just put this
on my head,

05:16.214 --> 05:17.423
you know, like a hat?

05:17.424 --> 05:18.969
- It is not a hat.
- Okay.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.348
If I'm putting it on my head,
then, uh...

05:21.349 --> 05:23.520
you know, by definition,
it's a...

05:23.521 --> 05:27.068
Gah!
Where is everything?

05:27.069 --> 05:30.284
- Hi.
- What the fuck is this place?

05:31.452 --> 05:35.628
We're in a place
where there are no shells.

05:37.381 --> 05:38.884
Oh.

05:38.885 --> 05:41.180
- Notice anything...
- different about me?

05:41.181 --> 05:44.227
You're dressed
like a little waiter?

05:47.944 --> 05:49.029
- Poke me.
- What?

05:49.030 --> 05:50.866
- Come on.
- Poke me.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.286
Anywhere.

05:53.413 --> 05:54.497
Ow.

05:54.498 --> 05:55.918
Poke me.
Don't jab me.

05:55.919 --> 05:57.630
- Wait.
- You're real.

05:57.631 --> 05:59.634
Well, I like to think
that I'm always real,

05:59.635 --> 06:02.013
but, yes, in here,

06:02.014 --> 06:04.392
you can perceive me
as a physical being.

06:04.393 --> 06:05.812
What is this place?

06:05.813 --> 06:07.650
It could be easier
to show you

06:07.651 --> 06:09.277
rather than explain.
Try this.

06:09.278 --> 06:11.950
Imagine an object,
any object.

06:11.951 --> 06:13.620
Picture it in your mind's eye.

06:13.621 --> 06:15.248
- Mind's don't have eyes.
- Trust me.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.711
I've seen a lot of 'em
splattered on my boots.

06:17.712 --> 06:19.800
It's just like a goo.

06:20.927 --> 06:22.596
- Okay.
- Watch me.

06:22.597 --> 06:25.727
Say I want a red ball.

06:25.728 --> 06:27.648
I simply...

06:27.649 --> 06:30.236
imagine it...

06:30.237 --> 06:31.865
Ta-da!

06:32.951 --> 06:34.328
It's as real as I am.

06:35.330 --> 06:36.750
Yeah.

06:37.877 --> 06:40.716
Okay.
Now you try.

06:40.717 --> 06:44.222
Close your eyes
and imagine something.

06:44.223 --> 06:46.018
Like what?

06:46.019 --> 06:48.023
Anything at all.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.863
Okay.

06:51.864 --> 06:52.990
Okay.

06:52.991 --> 06:54.577
You went with, uh...

06:54.578 --> 06:56.079
an identical red ball.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.833
Okay.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.712
But that's pretty cool, right?

06:59.713 --> 07:02.258
Amazing, now we have
two little red balls.

07:02.259 --> 07:05.056
Two little red balls
that we imagined

07:05.057 --> 07:06.768
and are now physical objects.

07:06.769 --> 07:09.189
You can create anything
you want in here.

07:09.190 --> 07:10.609
Try again.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.697
Imagine something
completely different.

07:17.832 --> 07:19.292
Okay.

07:19.293 --> 07:20.962
Okay,
I should have been more clear.

07:20.963 --> 07:24.678
Imagine something different
than a little ball.

07:24.679 --> 07:27.977
Let your mind run wild.
Go as big as you can dream.

07:29.355 --> 07:31.149
Um...

07:34.281 --> 07:36.953
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I imagined.

07:36.954 --> 07:40.710
Okay, I-I don't think you're
quite grasping the power of--

07:40.711 --> 07:42.046
Your ball creator?

07:42.047 --> 07:44.092
It is so much more
than balls.

07:44.093 --> 07:45.261
So much more than balls.

07:45.262 --> 07:46.681
I'm giving you a nuclear weapon

07:46.682 --> 07:48.225
and you're using it
like a cap gun.

07:48.226 --> 07:50.689
You told me
to picture something bigger.

07:50.690 --> 07:53.110
I meant something more
like this.

07:53.111 --> 07:54.530
Gah!

07:54.531 --> 07:56.617
what the fuck?

08:03.423 --> 08:05.134
God damn it.

08:05.135 --> 08:06.637
So back when
I worked at the lab,

08:06.638 --> 08:08.850
this was my favorite place
to get lunch.

08:08.851 --> 08:10.604
It's just a simple taco truck,

08:10.605 --> 08:12.900
but they have
really authentic Mexican.

08:12.901 --> 08:15.655
Their plain chicken tacos
with no sauce are to die for.

08:15.656 --> 08:18.327
- So this is all just--
- It's from my imagination.

08:18.328 --> 08:19.872
Memories mostly.

08:19.873 --> 08:22.168
This place hasn't existed
for 150 years,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.253
but just because
it doesn't exist

08:23.254 --> 08:24.798
in the analog world anymore,

08:24.799 --> 08:26.259
doesn't mean that it
can't keep being real.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.598
So, if this is all
just your fantasy,

08:28.599 --> 08:30.894
- why are we waiting in line?
- I love the waiting.

08:30.895 --> 08:33.232
The anticipation
of placing your order,

08:33.233 --> 08:34.777
is the taco man
gonna be nice to me?

08:34.778 --> 08:36.656
are they out of horchata yet?

08:36.657 --> 08:38.868
Of course, if you don't like
being at the back of the line,

08:38.869 --> 08:41.248
we can always be
a little closer to the front.

08:41.249 --> 08:43.168
- May I help you?
- Oh, hello.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.630
Yeah, that's more like it.

08:44.631 --> 08:46.132
Should have gotten here
earlier, suckers.

08:46.133 --> 08:48.346
See? That's why this place
is so great.

08:49.724 --> 08:51.142
- ¡Hola!
- Hola.

08:51.143 --> 08:52.646
So what kind of tacos
do you want?

08:52.647 --> 08:54.567
- I can get any kind?
- Any kind at all.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.737
Even one that's not
on the menu?

08:56.738 --> 08:58.700
If you can imagine it,
it's on the menu.

08:58.701 --> 09:00.954
I want a cat taco.

09:00.955 --> 09:02.624
- Cat?
- Mm-hmm.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.462
I want a cat taco
grilled over a garbage fire.

09:05.463 --> 09:07.174
Okie-dokie.

09:07.175 --> 09:10.932
Uh, dos tacos de pollo
y dos tacos de gato.

09:10.933 --> 09:13.103
- Por favor.
- Dos pollos, dos gatos.

09:13.104 --> 09:15.734
And whatever the horchata is.

09:15.735 --> 09:17.278
- Oh, you're in luck.
- There's one left.

09:17.279 --> 09:18.990
- Oh, lucky me.
- 5.50.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.869
My treat.

09:20.870 --> 09:23.166
They love it when you pay
with exact change.

09:24.293 --> 09:26.631
- Gracias.
- Gracias, amigo.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.342
Uh, whatever.

09:29.721 --> 09:31.766
Well?

09:31.767 --> 09:33.186
Mmm, yeah.

09:34.606 --> 09:36.149
Yeah, tastes just like the ones

09:36.150 --> 09:37.986
my ward-leader used to give us
on Festivus.

09:37.987 --> 09:39.782
- That's good, right?
- Eh.

09:39.783 --> 09:41.702
I don't know.
This is too weird.

09:41.703 --> 09:43.581
It tastes real, but...

09:43.582 --> 09:45.543
- I know it's not real.
- But it is real.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.254
Or as real as anything else is.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.092
That's what
I'm trying to show you.

09:49.093 --> 09:51.847
If in the regular world
I was to give you a taco,

09:51.848 --> 09:53.976
how would you know it was real?

09:53.977 --> 09:56.982
- Because it is real.
- But what makes it real?

09:56.983 --> 09:59.863
The real tortilla,
the real cat.

09:59.864 --> 10:01.701
- No.
- It's your brain.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.453
Nope, my brain
does not make tacos.

10:03.454 --> 10:05.667
The only thing my brain makes
is a yellow wax,

10:05.668 --> 10:07.461
and it pushes out my ears,

10:07.462 --> 10:09.883
and trust me,
it does not taste like tacos.

10:09.884 --> 10:13.223
- Okay, just stay with me here.
- It's your brain.

10:13.224 --> 10:15.310
It's billions
of neurons firing,

10:15.311 --> 10:17.566
telling you the texture
of the tortilla,

10:17.567 --> 10:19.695
the smell of the meat,
the heat,

10:19.696 --> 10:21.657
the--the taste.
Everything.

10:21.658 --> 10:24.997
It's just signals
perceived by your brain.

10:24.998 --> 10:27.669
So if your brain
perceives signals telling you

10:27.670 --> 10:29.757
that this is
a delicious gato taco,

10:29.758 --> 10:32.428
how is that any less real
than a real gato taco?

10:32.429 --> 10:35.267
Welp,
you've done the impossible.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.899
You've made cat tacos
unappealing.

10:38.776 --> 10:41.530
Okay, I--I know it sounds kooky,

10:41.531 --> 10:44.410
but the only thing that's real
is your mind.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.374
Everything else--
your body, the world,

10:47.375 --> 10:49.713
the so-called reality
that you live in--

10:49.714 --> 10:52.426
all of that
is just constructs, shells.

10:52.427 --> 10:54.765
Look, Stu, this might
all make sense to you,

10:54.766 --> 10:57.394
but I'm not a nerd.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.940
So you can say this is real,

10:58.941 --> 11:01.110
but it's just a big,
fancy trick.

11:04.034 --> 11:05.870
God damn it, Stuart!

11:05.871 --> 11:07.582
You gotta give me a three count

11:07.583 --> 11:09.878
before you just switch
planes of existence on me.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.256
Sorry, sorry.

11:11.257 --> 11:12.551
I just want you
to understand this

11:12.552 --> 11:14.513
the way that I understand this.

11:14.514 --> 11:16.684
This isn't a trick.

11:16.685 --> 11:18.646
Think...

11:18.647 --> 11:21.735
- Think of your happiest memory.
- Stu, I don't have a happies--

11:29.042 --> 11:30.335
This is your happiest memory?

12:06.743 --> 12:10.166
It was the sweetest thing
I had ever tasted.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.423
Pure sugar.

12:17.347 --> 12:19.350
This happened years ago,
didn't it?

12:19.351 --> 12:21.104
But what you're feeling
right now,

12:21.105 --> 12:23.818
what you just saw,
that's real, isn't it?

12:23.819 --> 12:27.909
I used to stare at that
sweet sugar dice

12:27.910 --> 12:29.746
every night.

12:29.747 --> 12:31.875
I couldn't believe
that something so simple,

12:31.876 --> 12:36.175
so delicious...

12:36.176 --> 12:38.556
Could exist
in such a horrible place.

12:42.147 --> 12:44.483
It gave me hope.

12:44.484 --> 12:46.780
Okay.

12:46.781 --> 12:48.994
Now let's try something else.

12:50.455 --> 12:52.876
Imagine a conversation
you wish you had.

12:52.877 --> 12:55.673
Something that never happened,
but you desperately wanted.

12:55.674 --> 12:56.800
Stu, I don't--

12:58.471 --> 13:01.643
What is this?
Where am I?

13:01.644 --> 13:03.146
Am I dead?

13:03.147 --> 13:05.067
Okay, uh,
imagine her calming down.

13:05.068 --> 13:06.820
Is this the great beyon--

13:06.821 --> 13:08.323
oh, hello Ty-Anne.

13:11.371 --> 13:13.793
- Morning, Estelle.
- You're a sight.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.339
You been spending evenings
in those jazz clubs again?

13:16.340 --> 13:18.051
Ah, you know,
I can't help it.

13:18.052 --> 13:20.013
I just love that dirty brass.

13:20.014 --> 13:22.059
Oh, it's good seeing you.

13:23.479 --> 13:26.275
Oh...
There goes Elias again.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.779
You know, he misses you
something terrible.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.406
I killed him.

13:29.407 --> 13:32.539
I--yeah, I mean, I helped--
I helped kill him.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.584
It was long after you died,

13:34.585 --> 13:37.172
but still, I'm--I'm sorry.

13:37.173 --> 13:38.884
Tell me about him.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.220
Uh...

13:40.221 --> 13:41.890
- he had herpes.
- Mm.

13:41.891 --> 13:43.519
But there was--there was
more to him than that.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.982
He was a kind, brilliant man,

13:45.983 --> 13:47.652
but in the end,
his work would have lead

13:47.653 --> 13:50.658
to something
really awful happening.

13:50.659 --> 13:53.497
Which is why we had to...
you know.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.587
That boy...

13:56.588 --> 13:59.300
he's always getting
into some trouble.

13:59.301 --> 14:02.222
You know, he had a good heart,
but something changed in him

14:02.223 --> 14:04.561
after he lost
that dance off in college.

14:04.562 --> 14:06.732
Yeah, that's on us too.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.777
Well, Futturman, really.

14:08.778 --> 14:10.615
He got over it
and he was actually

14:10.616 --> 14:12.409
doing quite well
for several years,

14:12.410 --> 14:15.750
until he unexpectedly
ended his marriage

14:15.751 --> 14:17.419
and he went off on that sailing
trip

14:17.420 --> 14:20.091
with his best friend,
The Reverend Leslie.

14:20.092 --> 14:21.845
Yes.

14:21.846 --> 14:24.141
- His friend.
- Hmm.

14:24.142 --> 14:26.145
Estelle,
I-I want you to know,

14:26.146 --> 14:29.068
I wouldn't have--
I wouldn't have done it

14:29.069 --> 14:31.280
- if there were another way.
- Well...

14:31.281 --> 14:32.992
I suppose you could
have killed me, right?

14:32.993 --> 14:35.372
Before I had Elias.

14:35.373 --> 14:37.125
- Huh.
- Wow, yeah.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.046
That...

14:39.047 --> 14:41.677
probably would have
been easier.

14:41.678 --> 14:43.347
Hmm.

14:44.474 --> 14:45.893
Well, that's gonna
annoy me now.

14:45.894 --> 14:48.481
Oh, pay it no mind.

14:48.482 --> 14:50.235
You're a good woman, Ty-Anne.

14:50.236 --> 14:53.032
Sometimes doing the right thing
requires sacrifice.

14:53.033 --> 14:56.247
Now I understand that.
I have no quarrel with you.

14:56.248 --> 14:58.292
Only love.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.346
Oh.

15:04.347 --> 15:06.643
Now, between you, me,
and the lamp post,

15:06.644 --> 15:09.274
I think that fellow
over there's sweet on you.

15:11.696 --> 15:13.156
Stuart?

15:13.157 --> 15:15.578
Yeah.
He's kind of cute, right?

15:15.579 --> 15:17.331
I mean, he looks like
a little waiter.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.921
You...

15:20.922 --> 15:22.424
You stop your foolin'.

15:22.425 --> 15:24.470
Well, I'm just saying...

15:24.471 --> 15:26.390
You know, I have a nose
for these sort of things.

15:29.105 --> 15:31.108
It was nice seeing you,
Ty-Anne.

15:32.738 --> 15:35.241
You too, Estelle.

15:40.294 --> 15:42.715
- Tiger?
- Where'd you go?

15:42.716 --> 15:44.512
Come with me.

15:50.147 --> 15:53.236
Hey, snazzy outfit.

15:53.237 --> 15:55.406
- Why are we in my fantasy?
- It's not your fantasy.

15:55.407 --> 15:58.037
It's mine.
Fall cartoonishly.

15:58.038 --> 15:59.833
Whoa.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.297
All right,
I'll have a full-roast tabby,

16:03.298 --> 16:05.886
don't skimp on the tail,
and a plate of cracklin's,

16:05.887 --> 16:07.389
German chocolate cake,

16:07.390 --> 16:10.103
and a hot blood-grog
served in the skull

16:10.104 --> 16:12.065
of Gribnar
The Rarely Gentle.

16:12.066 --> 16:13.401
That's one of my best kills.

16:13.402 --> 16:14.822
5.50.

16:16.032 --> 16:18.119
Keep the change,
and, uh...

16:18.120 --> 16:20.248
grow a mustache.

16:20.249 --> 16:21.751
Oh.

16:21.752 --> 16:23.755
- See how fun this is?
- Once you let go

16:23.756 --> 16:25.466
of your preconceived notions
of reality, you can--

16:25.467 --> 16:28.181
Yeah, okay, you don't have
to keep convincing me.

16:28.182 --> 16:30.603
I know that this isn't real,
but...

You've got some moves.

19:19.566 --> 19:21.653
Hey, you've got some pipes.

19:21.654 --> 19:23.990
I don't know
that I've ever felt so free.

19:23.991 --> 19:25.702
It was amazing.

19:25.703 --> 19:27.623
The real you came out
for the first time in there.

19:32.634 --> 19:35.973
I wish I could
see the real you.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.979
I mean,
if there was a real you.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.108
There is.

19:43.405 --> 19:45.409
And I wanna show you.

19:55.178 --> 19:58.100
I never
take anyone down here.

19:58.101 --> 20:00.438
Literally.
You are the first human being

20:00.439 --> 20:03.695
I've ever shown...
me too.

20:03.696 --> 20:05.072
Nice turrets.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.620
Those LK-7 Liquifire
Inskinerators?

20:07.621 --> 20:09.749
LK-8s actually.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.752
Damn.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.890
So, um...

20:19.310 --> 20:21.356
- I-I just...
- What?

20:23.694 --> 20:26.073
You revealed
a part of yourself today

20:26.074 --> 20:28.452
that you keep hidden,
the inside,

20:28.453 --> 20:30.331
and I want to do
the same for you,

20:30.332 --> 20:34.340
but the part that I'm afraid
to show people is the outside.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.721
Because it's, um--

20:37.722 --> 20:40.686
it's confusing
and a little weird.

20:40.687 --> 20:44.402
Hey, all of this is confusing
and a little weird.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.533
Yeah.

20:47.534 --> 20:48.994
Okay.

20:48.995 --> 20:50.956
This is as far as I can go.

20:50.957 --> 20:53.378
But I'll be with you
the whole time.

21:08.743 --> 21:12.457
This is me.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.377
You're beautiful.

21:14.378 --> 21:16.006
You don't have to say that.

21:16.007 --> 21:17.718
No, I mean--I...

21:17.719 --> 21:20.056
I mean it.
I've...

21:20.057 --> 21:21.726
I've seen so much ugliness
in the world,

21:21.727 --> 21:24.189
but this is...

21:24.190 --> 21:25.650
this is magnificent.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.320
When I first started
experimenting

21:27.321 --> 21:29.240
with uploaded consciousness,

21:29.241 --> 21:32.790
I had to use
physical organic brain matter.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.794
How much of yours is in here?

21:34.795 --> 21:36.338
Now?

21:36.339 --> 21:37.966
Only a cortex or two.

21:37.967 --> 21:41.348
This is all that's left
of my physical being.

21:45.733 --> 21:47.569
Can I touch it?

21:47.570 --> 21:49.991
Uh...uh, Tiger...

21:51.912 --> 21:54.082
- I promise I'll be gentle.
- Uh...

21:54.083 --> 21:56.629
- I--I'm not sure.
- Okay.

21:56.630 --> 21:59.677
Okay, hey--hey,
we can just hang out

21:59.678 --> 22:01.806
and we can just talk.

22:01.807 --> 22:03.308
Well...

22:03.309 --> 22:05.605
I'm--I'm not saying...

22:05.606 --> 22:07.191
you can't touch it.

22:10.658 --> 22:12.537
Do you want me to touch it?

22:16.043 --> 22:17.045
Yeah.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.527
I can't believe
we're doing this.

22:37.670 --> 22:39.924
- Wait.
- What? What? What? What?

22:39.925 --> 22:42.513
Uh, we should use protection.

22:43.766 --> 22:45.142
- Of course.
- Right.

22:45.143 --> 22:46.646
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

22:46.647 --> 22:48.233
It's okay.
Just, uh, here.

22:50.070 --> 22:51.657
Oh.

22:53.159 --> 22:54.579
Okay.

22:57.251 --> 22:58.671
Uh...

23:07.187 --> 23:09.023
Okay, I don't know.
I'm...

23:09.024 --> 23:11.069
I think you got it--
uh, I think you backwards.

23:11.070 --> 23:12.907
Ah, yeah.

23:14.744 --> 23:16.162
- Okay.
- Hurry.

23:16.163 --> 23:17.791
Oh--I'm just--I'm trying.

23:17.792 --> 23:19.294
Leave a little bit
on the end and then--

23:19.295 --> 23:21.590
- and roll it down the base.
- Okay, yep, yep.

23:21.591 --> 23:23.468
I feel like it would
feel better without this,

23:23.469 --> 23:24.806
but it's fine.

23:34.241 --> 23:36.077
Hi.

23:36.078 --> 23:37.455
Hi.

23:37.456 --> 23:40.378
Yeah.
Oh, a little to the left.

23:43.259 --> 23:44.928
- Like that?
- Yeah.

23:44.929 --> 23:47.893
Yeah, right there.
Yeah, rub that in the glo--

23:47.894 --> 23:49.605
- Yeah.
- Oh...

23:49.606 --> 23:51.609
Ah, that feels good.

23:51.610 --> 23:54.531
I-I can feel you pulsing.

23:54.532 --> 23:56.326
Yeah, it's low--

23:56.327 --> 23:58.623
low-voltage electric shocks.

24:00.418 --> 24:02.964
You can, um--you can--
you can up the voltage.

24:02.965 --> 24:04.885
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:07.517 --> 24:08.768
Stu!

24:08.769 --> 24:09.853
God.

24:11.942 --> 24:13.110
Tiger.

24:13.111 --> 24:14.445
Oh, Tiger.

24:14.446 --> 24:16.241
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:19.248 --> 24:22.754
Stu!

24:26.721 --> 24:29.643
Well, I should, um...

24:29.644 --> 24:32.274
I should probably
get some shut-eye.

24:33.610 --> 24:35.865
I remember sleep.

24:37.994 --> 24:40.039
Good night, Stu.

24:42.335 --> 24:44.966
Hey, uh...

24:47.722 --> 24:49.933
There's something
I think I should tell you.

24:49.934 --> 24:51.604
Uh...

24:51.605 --> 24:53.566
I'm trying to find
the right words.

24:53.567 --> 24:55.820
You can, uh...

24:55.821 --> 24:57.658
You can tell me anything.

25:00.706 --> 25:03.168
You know, this whole plan
to relocate humanity to Mars?

25:03.169 --> 25:05.130
- Yeah.
- Well, technically,

25:05.131 --> 25:07.092
I don't mean the planet Mars.

25:07.093 --> 25:09.138
MARS actually stands for

25:09.139 --> 25:12.353
"Mankind's Automated
Reality System."

25:12.354 --> 25:13.814
That's where I took you today.

25:13.815 --> 25:15.735
So you're gonna--

25:15.736 --> 25:17.238
you're gonna upload everyone?

25:17.239 --> 25:19.075
I really did want
to take us to Mars.

25:19.076 --> 25:21.329
That was the original plan.

25:21.330 --> 25:23.458
But as it turns out,

25:23.459 --> 25:26.172
transporting the entire
human race to another planet

25:26.173 --> 25:27.676
is damn near impossible.

25:27.677 --> 25:30.097
So I developed an alternative,

25:30.098 --> 25:32.811
which, honestly,
is far superior.

25:32.812 --> 25:35.692
Okay, so why the space suits
and the rockets

25:35.693 --> 25:38.154
and the clearly misleading
acronym?

25:38.155 --> 25:41.912
The upload only takes
if the subject goes willingly.

25:41.913 --> 25:43.958
The idea of transferring
a consciousness

25:43.959 --> 25:47.089
scares a lot of people,
but a journey to Mars,

25:47.090 --> 25:48.884
that sounds like
a fun adventure.

25:48.885 --> 25:51.347
It's pretty sneaky, Stu.

25:51.348 --> 25:53.018
Guess you're not a big believer

25:53.019 --> 25:54.605
in people making
their own decisions.

25:54.606 --> 25:56.107
People have been
making their own decisions

25:56.108 --> 25:57.819
for thousands of years

25:57.820 --> 26:00.115
and it brought them
to the brink of annihilation.

26:00.116 --> 26:02.161
So you--
you think you're qualified

26:02.162 --> 26:04.165
to act on behalf of humanity?

26:04.166 --> 26:05.292
I think I am.

26:05.293 --> 26:08.633
Just imagine a world

26:08.634 --> 26:11.346
with no hunger
because nobody needs to eat.

26:11.347 --> 26:14.728
A world with no poverty
because resources are infinite.

26:14.729 --> 26:17.274
A world where everyone
can finally get along.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.821
Your friends and family
are always close by.

26:19.822 --> 26:22.911
A world where
the music's always hot

26:22.912 --> 26:25.082
and the cat meat's
always fresh.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.960
A world without shells.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.465
That's humanity's future.

26:29.466 --> 26:31.595
That's MARS.

26:31.596 --> 26:33.431
Will you come with me?

26:44.121 --> 26:45.749
Yeah.

26:46.543 --> 26:49.673
I can't save the world
if I can't save you.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.426
I must not be the real J-1.

26:51.427 --> 26:53.889
J-1--real J-1 could definitely,
definitely fix you.

26:53.890 --> 26:55.685
Could definitely turn you on.

26:55.686 --> 26:58.356
That makes me what?
That makes me fucking what?

26:58.357 --> 27:01.112
J-0?
J-nothing?

27:01.113 --> 27:02.782
Okay, come on.

27:02.783 --> 27:04.704
Come on.
Come on.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.378
Oh, please.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.923
Please give me a sign.

27:10.924 --> 27:13.513
Anything to keep me going.
Please.

27:18.481 --> 27:22.531
That--that is a good one,
you sick, sick fuck.

27:27.373 --> 27:28.876
Oh, my God.

27:30.129 --> 27:32.341
You can speak

27:32.342 --> 27:34.178
and you have
the voice of an angel.

27:39.690 --> 27:42.194
I love you so much,
Pup-E Q. Barkington.

27:43.865 --> 27:45.408
Who's a good boy?

27:48.374 --> 27:51.420
Good boy.
Who's a good boy?

27:51.421 --> 27:53.634
Joosh?

27:53.635 --> 27:54.970
Here?

28:02.277 --> 28:03.988
- Who's a good boy?
- Bring me this boy.

28:03.989 --> 28:06.577
If anyone tries to stop you,

28:06.578 --> 28:08.622
kill them.

28:10.126 --> 28:13.006
Ooh, you got the
stinky puppy breath.

28:13.007 --> 28:14.801
Who got
the stinky puppy breath?

28:14.802 --> 28:16.597
Who's my only friend
in the whole world?

28:16.598 --> 28:19.604
You're my only friend
in the whole world.
