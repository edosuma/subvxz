IT WAS SO AMAZING.
IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUST, YOU KNOW.

WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE

08:06.887 --> 08:08.155
DOING THE TYING TOO.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.857
- AND THE WAY
HE HELD ME AFTERWARDS,

08:09.890 --> 08:12.860
I'VE NEVER FELT SO CLOSE.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.762
- I BET YOU DON'T FIND
THAT KIND OF INTIMACY

08:14.795 --> 08:16.263
AT THE WHITE PARTY.

08:16.296 --> 08:19.667
[both moan passionately]

08:19.700 --> 08:21.902
- YEAH, I-I GUESS NOT.

08:21.935 --> 08:25.305

CAN'T COMPARE WITH WHAT I GOT.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.608
- YEAH, WELL...

08:27.641 --> 08:31.679
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO SETTLE
FOR THE NEXT BEST THING.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.187
- THERE YOU GO.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.089
- OH. NO, THAT'S MINE.
- NO, IT'S OURS.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.624
THIS IS OUR WAY
OF SAYING THANKS

08:43.657 --> 08:45.659
FOR ALL YOU DID
FOR OUR WEDDING.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.227
- YOU GUYS DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.896
WAITER, STEAK TO GO.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.332
[laughter]

09:08.281 --> 09:10.117
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT GA-GA NOW.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.052
- SO, WHY DID YOU
WANT TO COME HERE,

09:12.085 --> 09:14.688
IF NOT TO RUB ELBOWS
WITH ALL THE "A"-GAYS?

09:14.722 --> 09:17.791
- I'M ALLOWED,

09:17.825 --> 09:20.060
EVEN IF I AM
JUST A MEASLY "B"-GAY.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.329
- WELL, IF "B" STANDS
FOR THE BEST, THEN I AGREE.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.064

PRETENTIOUS PARTIES.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.685

I'M HAVING A LITTLE,
UH, GET-TOGETHER AT MY PLACE

10:06.406 --> 10:08.709
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

10:08.742 --> 10:13.113

IF YOU COULD DROP BY.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.984

UH, SURE, I'D LOVE TO.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.087

PLEASURE TO MEET ALL OF YOU.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.300
- I'M GOING TO GARTH'S.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.043
- CARE FOR A REFILL, MA'AM?

10:43.076 --> 10:46.146
- OH, NO, THANKS, HONEY.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.349
I GOTTA SLEEP TONIGHT,
AT LEAST TRY TO.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.422
YOU GO ON HOME.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.891
DEB, THIS IS, LIKE,
YOUR WHOLE DAY'S TIP.

10:57.925 --> 11:01.161
- YOU CARRIED THINGS TONIGHT.
YOU DESERVE IT.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.432
- IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU KNEW HIM.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.434
HE WAS ONE OF, LIKE,
1,000 GUYS THAT YOU WAITED ON.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.837
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
SUNSHINE, HE WAS ONE OF US.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.305
HE WAS PART
OF THE COMMUNITY.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.342
I CAN'T HELP FEELING
SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.477
- WHAT?
THAT HE'S DEAD?

11:17.510 --> 11:22.315
- NO, THAT HE'S LYING OUT THERE
IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.217
- WELL, WHAT CAN YOU DO?

11:24.251 --> 11:27.454
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.323
FIND OUT WHO HE WAS.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.792
- THAT'S WHAT
THE POLICE ARE FOR.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.927
- THOSE FAT FUCKS?

11:33.961 --> 11:35.929
CHRIST, THE WAY
THEY TALKED ABOUT HIM,

11:35.963 --> 11:38.799
CALLING HIM A "JANE DOE."

11:38.832 --> 11:43.136
THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.505
NOBODY DOES.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.242
- THEN DO IT.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.423
I DIDN'T MEAN RIGHT NOW.

12:03.456 --> 12:08.228
- THE SOONER I LIGHT A FIRE
UNDER THAT COP'S LARD ASS,

12:08.261 --> 12:11.131
THE SOONER
HE'LL GET IT IN GEAR.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.502
- AND THEN GARTH
INVITED ME TO HIS HOUSE

12:15.535 --> 12:18.505
FOR A VERY EXCLUSIVE
LITTLE GET-TOGETHER.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.107
- WHILE HE'S BUSY
EXCLUDING OTHERS,

12:20.140 --> 12:22.442
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHY HE'S INCLUDING YOU?

12:22.475 --> 12:24.144
- FOR MY WIT AND MY CHARM,
OF COURSE.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.512
JUST BECAUSE YOU'LL
NEVER BE INVITED--

12:25.545 --> 12:27.280
- JUST SO HAPPENS I'VE BEEN
INVITED TO HIS CIRCLE'S

12:27.314 --> 12:30.283
LITTLE GET-TOGETHERS
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.484
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE?

12:31.518 --> 12:33.987
- WHY WOULD I WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH A BUNCH OF ARROGANT,

12:34.021 --> 12:35.856
SELF-IMPORTANT ASSHOLES?

12:35.889 --> 12:37.457
- 'CAUSE YOU'D FIT RIGHT IN?

12:37.490 --> 12:38.325
- HI.
- HEY, EMMETT.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.861
- NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- YOU KNOW HIM?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.996
- YEAH, VERY WELL.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.898
- HUH. SMALL WORLD.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.867
- WHY, YOU DID HIM TOO?
- MM-MM.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.537
NO, BUT I WENT HOME WITH,
UH, LUSCIOUS LIPS OVER THERE.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.540
WHO SPENT A NIGHT
ON BALD MOUNTAIN,

12:53.573 --> 12:57.310
WHO USED TO CHOW DOWN
ON YOUR LOVE MUFFIN.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.578
- YEAH, WELL,
I DID ALL THREE.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.147
- [scoffs]
- AT ONCE?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.816
- I TRIED.
SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES.

13:02.850 --> 13:06.153
- WHO HAVEN'T YOU FUCKED?
- HASN'T FUCKED ME.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.890
OR ANYBODY I'VE BEEN WITH.
- [laughs]

13:09.923 --> 13:11.925
- WHAT?

13:11.959 --> 13:15.195
- NOTHING. NOTHING.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.300
- THERE'S ME.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.436
- OH, MY--
- HOLY SHIT.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.438
- NICE GOING,
LITTLE TWAT.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.307
- OW.

13:27.340 --> 13:31.078
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.448
[chuckles]
THAT IS SO HILARIOUS.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.984
[nervous laugh]

13:37.017 --> 13:39.186
- GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
GLAD YOU THINK SO.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.587
- [chuckles]

13:40.620 --> 13:42.923
WELL, WHY SHOULDN'T I,
YOU KNOW? IT'S PITTSBURGH.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.226
NO DEGREES OF SEPARATION.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.433
- CAN I HELP YOU?

14:26.466 --> 14:29.169
- YEAH, I NEED
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.439
BUT I GOTTA SAY, I WAS
HOPING IT WOULDN'T BE YOU.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.641
- COME IN.
KICK BACK. RELAX.

14:34.674 --> 14:38.245
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO RELAX,
BUT I'M SO GLAD YOU DO.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.113
WHY IS THERE NO NAME
ON HIS GRAVE?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.381
- WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.184
- BULLSHIT.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.554
- LOOK, LADY, I'VE GONE THROUGH
EVERY MISSING PERSON'S REPORT

14:47.587 --> 14:50.323
THAT EVEN REMOTELY
MATCHES HIS DESCRIPTION.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.193
AND SO FAR,
NOBODY'S MISSING HIM.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.694
- WELL, THEN KEEP LOOKING.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.397
- LADY--
- AND STOP CALLING ME "LADY."

14:57.430 --> 15:00.567
YOU SOUND LIKE JERRY LEWIS.
THE NAME'S DEBBIE.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.935
- DEBBIE--

15:01.969 --> 15:03.403
- BUT YOU CAN CALL ME
MRS. NOVOTNY.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.706
- MRS. NOVOTNY.
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.176
BUT IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

15:09.209 --> 15:14.581
- OH, AND DON'T YOU TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUT IT IS.

15:14.614 --> 15:20.320
THIS KID HAS GOT A NAME.
AND I'M GONNA FIND IT!

15:30.197 --> 15:33.033
- HO! TAKE IT EASY,
BIG FELLA.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.435
- I'M SO HORNED OUT.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.038
I'VE HAD A RAGING HARD-ON
ALL THE WAY HOME.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.740
- HMM, I WAS AFRAID
HEARING ABOUT BRIAN AND ME

15:40.773 --> 15:43.443
WOULD HAVE
THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.478
I GUESS MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.581
- I TOLD YOU,
IT'S NO BIGGIE.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.050
BUT THIS IS.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.219
- OOH, LUCKY FOR ME
YOU HAVE SUCH A--

15:52.252 --> 15:55.188
MM, MM, MMMMM.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.091
KIND AND UNDERSTANDING
NATURE.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.628
BUT IT WAS STILL
A SHITTY WAY TO FIND OUT.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.464
- I HAVE THE HOTTEST
BOYFRIEND IN TOWN.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.600
IT'S A GIVEN THAT BRIAN
WOULD'VE FUCKED HIM.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.736
- IT WAS A CASUAL THING.

16:09.769 --> 16:13.140
ONE NIGHT, LONG BEFORE
YOU WERE BORN.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.741
TO ME, THAT IS.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.643
- I TOLD YOU,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.011
I MEAN, WE DON'T
HAVE TO TELL EACH OTHER

16:18.045 --> 16:21.081
EVERYBODY WE SLEPT WITH
BEFORE WE MET.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.116
I WOULDN'T REMEMBER
HALF THEIR NAMES ANYWAYS.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.453
LEAVE YOUR UNDERWEAR ON,
I'M GOING TO CHEW THROUGH 'EM.

16:42.269 --> 16:45.038
- WHAT'S UP?
- YOU ARE.

16:52.412 --> 16:56.316
- NICE FORM, GUY.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.153
- I'LL SAY.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.257
REALLY GOT MY HEART RATE
GOING TOO.

17:04.291 --> 17:07.127
- MEET ME
AT THE SQUATS.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.397
- I COULD DEFINITELY
SQUAT ON THAT.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.166
- THAT'S RAINER,
MY NEW TRAINER.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.137
- I SEE HE'S ALREADY TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO SIT UP AND BEG.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.706
- [grunts]
GARTH RECOMMENDED HIM.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.808
HE ONLY TRAINS WITH THE BEST.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.676
AH, IT'S DEFINITELY
WORTH IT.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.678
I CAN FEEL
THE DIFFERENCE ALREADY.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.681
- HEY, BRIAN.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.151
- OH, DON'T TELL ME.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.452
- YEAH.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.820
YOU KNOW,
HE'S LIKE A GERMAN TRAIN.

17:33.853 --> 17:37.557
HE ALWAYS
COMES IN ON TIME.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.725
- SORRY I'M LATE.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.161
- WERE YOU TIED UP?

17:41.194 --> 17:42.295
- YOU WANT TO SPOT ME?

17:42.329 --> 17:44.431
- NO, I HAVE TO GO HAVE
A WORD WITH TED'S NEW TRAINER,

17:44.464 --> 17:47.567
HAVE HIM CHECK OUT
MY FORWARD LUNGE.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.436
- BABYLON TONIGHT?

17:49.469 --> 17:50.703
- YEAH.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.205
- SO, UH...

17:52.239 --> 17:53.273
DID YOU AND BEN
HAVE A FIGHT?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.508
- OR WAS IT JUST LIKE,
YOU KNOW, AWKWARD SILENCE?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.377
- WHY?
BECAUSE HE AND BRIAN HAD SEX?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.845
- IF IT WAS MY BOYFRIEND
AND I FOUND OUT

17:58.878 --> 18:00.213
THAT BRIAN HAD DONE
THE DIRTY WITH HIM,

18:00.247 --> 18:01.514
IT'D BE GAME OVER.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.351
HOW COULD I MEASURE UP?
- YOU COULDN'T.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.186
- HEY.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.188
FOR BRIAN,
SEX IS LIKE A HANDSHAKE.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.123
- HMM, THAT AIN'T WHAT
HE WAS SHAKING, SWEETIE.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.592
- THEY KNOW
EACH OTHER INTIMATELY.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.463
- HOW THEY FEEL,
HOW THEY SMELL.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.498
- THE SOUNDS THEY MAKE
WHEN THEY'RE COMING.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.534
- WOULD YOU TWO
SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY?

18:21.568 --> 18:22.735
- DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.870
- ARE WE GOING
TO WORK OUT

18:23.903 --> 18:26.539
OR ARE WE GOING TO STAND
AROUND HERE BLABBING ALL DAY?

18:31.511 --> 18:36.416
- * FEEL GOOD NOW

18:36.449 --> 18:40.420
* I FEEL GOOD NOW

18:40.453 --> 18:42.155
*

18:42.189 --> 18:43.290
* I FEEL GOOD NOW

18:43.323 --> 18:45.258
- DON'T FORGET THE DIMPLE
ON HIS CHIN.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.495
- GIVE ME A CHANCE,
I'M GETTING TO IT.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.230
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU GUYS LIVE ON.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.700
HOW DO YOU SURVIVE?

18:53.733 --> 18:56.503
- THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

18:56.536 --> 19:00.373
OKAY, SUNSHINE,
PRINT HER UP.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.275
WHAT'S THIS?

19:02.309 --> 19:04.244
- WHAT?
UH, THAT'S JUST...

19:04.277 --> 19:07.847
IT'S JUST HEAD CLEANER.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.816
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU
STILL LISTENED TO CASSETTES.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.951
- WHAT DO YOU SAY,
JEN, ARE YOU IN?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.254
- NO.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.855
I THINK YOU SHOULD
LEAVE THAT TO THE PROS.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.657
- BUT WE ARE THE PROS.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.826
WHO KNOWS LIBERTY AVENUE
BETTER THAN WE DO?

19:19.859 --> 19:23.396
- AH, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
DEBBIE, I'M JUST A TOURIST.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.699
- BUT YOU'RE A MOTHER.
WHAT IF IT WAS YOUR SON?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.472
- ALMOST WAS.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.575
[typing]

19:39.646 --> 19:42.449
[typing]

19:43.716 --> 19:47.554
- TEDDY, YOU HAVE ARRIVED.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.456
YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.691
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
YOU USED TO HATE?

19:51.724 --> 19:54.694
WELL, YOU ARE ONE
OF THEM NOW.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.564
BUT DON'T LOOK TOO EXCITED.

19:57.597 --> 20:01.701
ACTUALLY,
ACT A LITTLE BORED.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.770
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.506
AND REMEMBER,
YOU CAN DO THIS.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.708
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT OPERA,
YOU'RE POLITICALLY PLUGGED IN,

20:08.741 --> 20:10.710
YOU JUST ATTENDED
A PRODUCTION OF ASSASSINS.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.379
- TED.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.980
SO GLAD YOU COULD COME.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.848
- GARTH.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.619
THIS IS FOR YOU.
- AH.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.887
- OH, NO.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.522
HE'S LOOKING AT IT
LIKE IT'S THUNDERBIRD.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.358
GOD DAMN IT, TED, WHY DIDN'T
YOU GO FOR THE $65 BOTTLE?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.360
I TOLD YOU,
BUT NO, YOU HAD TO--

20:27.394 --> 20:30.263
- IT IS MY FAVORITE
CALIFORNIA PINOT.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.799
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.268
- MINE TOO.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.769
- LET ME INTRODUCE YOU AROUND.

20:36.803 --> 20:41.007
TED SCHMIDT,
ALISTAIR REYNOLDS, PSYCHIATRIST.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.343
- LUCKILY, NOT YOURS.
[chuckles]

20:43.376 --> 20:47.380
- MORLEY CAMPBELL.
MORLEY ORGANIZES GAY CRUISES.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.483
- WELL, THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT
SOUND LIKE THE LOVE BOAT, GARTH.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.753
IT'S ON A YACHT TO FIJI,
AND IT ONLY SLEEPS TEN.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.388
- WELL, THAT'S
THE FIRST NIGHT.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.756
WHAT ABOUT THE REST
OF THE CRUISE?

20:56.789 --> 21:00.026
[chuckles]

21:00.059 --> 21:02.362
- TED'S AN ENTREPRENEUR.
HE HAS HIS OWN WEB SITE.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.030
- REALLY?

21:04.063 --> 21:05.765
- GARTH.
- FORGIVE ME.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.767
- WE'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.068
JUST MOVED TO PITTSBURGH?

21:09.101 --> 21:12.305
- ACTUALLY, I'VE, UH,
LIVED HERE ALL MY LIFE.

21:12.339 --> 21:15.642
WENT TO NORTH ALLEGHENY HIGH,

21:15.675 --> 21:18.311
WAS PRESIDENT OF THE
JUNIOR ACCOUNTANTS CLUB.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.913
YEAH, I'VE ALWAYS HAD
AN AFFINITY FOR NUMBERS.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.516
REAL NUMBERS AND, UH...

21:23.550 --> 21:26.819
CUTE ONES, TOO.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.729
- IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE,

21:36.763 --> 21:39.332
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO TIE YOU UP AGAIN.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.569
- PROMISES, PROMISES.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.673
- DID BRIAN EVER DO THAT?

21:46.706 --> 21:48.675
- DO WHAT?
- TIE YOU UP.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.677
- [sighs]
YOU EXPECT ME TO REMEMBER?

21:50.710 --> 21:51.711
- IT WASN'T
THAT LONG AGO.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.914
- MAYBE.
NOW COME HERE.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.351
- THEY SAY HIS FUCKS
ARE LEGENDARY.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.853
- MM.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.923
- WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THEM?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.461
- WHY ARE YOU ASKING
ALL THESE QUESTIONS?

22:08.495 --> 22:09.962
- I'M JUST CURIOUS.
- IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

22:09.996 --> 22:14.701
- I'M COOL WITH IT.
REALLY.

22:14.734 --> 22:17.470
- HE WAS FUCKING ME,
AND HE CAME, RIGHT?

22:17.504 --> 22:18.871
BUT I HADN'T.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.007
SO HE JUST KEPT GOING.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.376
- NO SHIT.
- MM-HM.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.579
THEN HE CAME
A SECOND TIME...

22:26.613 --> 22:27.980
RIGHT WHEN I DID.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.383
NEVER LOST HIS HARD-ON.

22:30.417 --> 22:34.854
- MMM,
YOU HAD TO ASK.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.490
SO HOW DO I COMPARE TO--
- MICHAEL.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.725
- COME ON, TELL ME.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.860
- IT'S LIKE COMPARING
APPLES AND CANTALOUPES.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.529
- SO WHO HAS
THE CANTALOUPES?

22:42.562 --> 22:44.864
- YOU ARE FINE.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.934
- "FINE."

22:47.967 --> 22:49.669
- YOU'RE TERRIFIC,
YOU'RE GREAT.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.138
NOW, CAN WE STOP
TALKING ABOUT HIM?

22:52.171 --> 22:55.174
- I AGREE.
ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

22:55.207 --> 23:00.012
LET'S SEE SOME ACTION.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.581
- I JUST REMEMBERED,
I HAVE A SHIPMENT

23:01.614 --> 23:05.151
COMING IN AT THE STORE.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.686
- BUT ISN'T THE BEAUTY
OF HAVING YOUR OWN STORE

23:06.719 --> 23:09.756
BEING ON YOUR...

23:09.789 --> 23:13.660
OWN TIME?

23:15.194 --> 23:18.030
- THEN I WORKED AT WERTSHAFTER
AND COMPANY FOR EIGHT YEARS

23:18.064 --> 23:21.901
AND, UH, DOING AUDITS
AND FILING 401(k)s,

23:21.934 --> 23:26.939
YOU KNOW, THAT SORT
OF THING AND, UH...

23:26.973 --> 23:28.107
DID I--
UH, DID I MENTION

23:28.140 --> 23:30.843
THAT I SAW ASSASSINS
AT THE PLAYHOUSE LAST WEEK?

23:30.877 --> 23:33.079
YEAH, I REALLY THINK IT'S SOME
OF SONDHEIM'S BEST WORK.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.514
I THINK HE--

23:34.547 --> 23:35.648
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

23:35.682 --> 23:36.916
DO YOU MIND
IF I BORROW HIM?

23:36.949 --> 23:39.652
- NO.
- PLEASE.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.455
- HEH. SORRY.

23:42.489 --> 23:45.191
AH, IT'S A GREAT PARTY.
I LOVE YOUR HOUSE.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.826
- THANKS, TEDDY.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.529
DO YOU MIND
IF I CALL YOU TEDDY?

23:49.562 --> 23:52.131
- NO, ALL MY CLOSE FRIENDS DO.
- GOOD.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.833
YOU KNOW, I WENT TO YOUR
WEB SITE THE OTHER DAY,

23:53.866 --> 23:58.070
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
UH, I WAS RATHER IMPRESSED.

23:58.104 --> 24:01.007
- YOU WERE?

24:01.040 --> 24:02.742
THANK YOU, GARTH.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.144
YEAH, IT'S TAKEN A LOT OF WORK
TO GET IT TO A POINT WHERE I--

24:05.177 --> 24:07.714
- ESPECIALLY WITH ONE
OF YOUR YOUNG MEN, UM...

24:07.747 --> 24:10.149
REX?

24:10.182 --> 24:12.151
- REX?
OH, REX.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.853
- BEAUTIFUL BOY.
- AAH.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.154
- I WOULDN'T MIND
GETTING TO KNOW HIM.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.155
- [chuckles]

24:16.188 --> 24:20.226
- THINK YOU COULD POSSIBLY
SET SOMETHING UP?

24:20.259 --> 24:22.495
- OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T REALLY GET INVOLVED

24:22.529 --> 24:24.497
IN MY EMPLOYEES'
PERSONAL LIVES.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.998
- OF COURSE NOT.
BEST POLICY.

24:26.032 --> 24:30.737
ALTHOUGH I AM ONLY TALKING
ABOUT A FRIENDLY DINNER,

24:30.770 --> 24:36.175
AND I AM ASKING YOU,
TEDDY, AS A FRIEND.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.812
- HMM.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.049
- HEY, SAMMY.
LOVE THE HAIR, HONEY.

24:43.082 --> 24:47.587

HEY, KIDDO, HOW'S BILL?

24:58.898 --> 25:00.733
LISTEN, UH, IF YOU KNOW
WHO THIS KID IS,

25:00.767 --> 25:04.303
WILL YOU CALL THE POLICE?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.739
THANKS.
THANKS, BABY.

25:06.773 --> 25:11.611
- GOOD AFTERNOON,
WOULD YOU MIND JUST TAKING--

25:11.644 --> 25:12.779
- HOW YOU DOING?

25:12.812 --> 25:14.881
- I FEEL LIKE
THE INVISIBLE WOMAN.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.149

TO GET THEIR ATTENTION,

25:17.183 --> 25:20.787
YOU PRACTICALLY GOTTA GRAB THEM

- HI, THERE, I'M JENNIFER.
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

25:23.122 --> 25:26.158
- HEY, TYLER.
HOW ARE THE WARTS?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.160
- THEY WEREN'T
ON MY HANDS.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.297
- OH. UM, WE'RE--

25:31.330 --> 25:33.900
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHO THIS YOUNG MAN IS.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.968
DO YOU KNOW HIM?
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.237
WHO IS HE?
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?

25:38.270 --> 25:40.673
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WELL, WHERE'D YOU SEE HIM?

25:40.707 --> 25:44.176
- I USED TO SEE HIM HANGING OUT
AT THE LIBERTY SPA.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.845
- OKAY.
THANKS, HONEY.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.649
- WHAT'S THAT, A GYM?
- NOT EXACTLY.

25:49.682 --> 25:53.720
[mixed groaning, grunting]

25:53.753 --> 25:54.721
- HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

25:54.754 --> 25:57.189
WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHO THIS YOUNG MAN IS?

25:57.223 --> 26:01.193
[passionate moans]

26:01.227 --> 26:03.329
- UH, SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING,
FELLAS.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.798
BUT DO EITHER
OF YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.366
- [grunts] NO, NO, NO.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.136
- OKAY, THANKS ANYWAY.
- YES!

26:10.169 --> 26:12.204
- YOU PLAY SAFE.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.607
- HEY, NO BROADS
IN THE BATHHOUSE.

26:14.641 --> 26:17.343
- WE NEED TO BE HERE.
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.011
- THIS IS A PRIVATE
MEN'S CLUB.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.280
- SOMEONE WHO KNEW
THIS MURDERED KID.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.082
- OUT, OR I'LL CALL
THE COPS.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.017
- EXCUSE ME.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.720
I-I KNEW HIM.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.155
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?

26:29.188 --> 26:30.723
- HE DIDN'T SAY.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.825
- CHRIST, DOESN'T ANYBODY
EVEN INTRODUCE THEMSELVES

26:32.859 --> 26:35.361
BEFORE THEY FUCK?

26:35.394 --> 26:37.029
SORRY.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.698
- I FOLLOWED HIM
TO HIS ROOM.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.366
WE WERE DOING IT
WHEN HE STARTS GASPING.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.902
I'M THINKING,
"HEY, I'M PRETTY GOOD."

26:42.935 --> 26:44.837
TURNS OUT HE WAS
HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.039
HE SUCKED ON HIS INHALER
AND WAS FINE.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.709
BUT BY THEN THE MAGIC HAD
KIND OF WORN OFF, YOU KNOW?

26:49.742 --> 26:51.778
- WAS IT A PRESCRIPTION THING?

26:51.811 --> 26:54.246
- I THINK SO.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.248
[men groaning]

26:56.282 --> 26:59.118
- THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.088
- NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.837
[doorbells ringing]

27:22.041 --> 27:24.010
- DO YOU HAVE
THE NEW "BUTTMAN"?

27:24.043 --> 27:26.078
- I'M SOLD OUT.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.381
- OH.

27:33.352 --> 27:36.455
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO GO TO BABYLON.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.658
- BUSY.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.165
- "NEUTRON MAN HAS BROKEN
INTO A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT..."

27:46.198 --> 27:48.200
- HEY, DON'T LOOK.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.937
- "WHERE HE'S TORTURED
WITH AN AGONIZING DILDO."

27:50.970 --> 27:52.071
SORRY.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.240
"DILEMMA. HE CAN EITHER
DRAIN THE PLANET OF ITS POWER

27:54.273 --> 27:57.243
"AND LIVE, OR HE CAN
LET THE PLANET SUPPLY POWER

27:57.276 --> 28:00.913
TO THE WORLD, AND DIE."

28:00.947 --> 28:05.785
I SAY FUCK THE WORLD.
TAKE THE POWER.

28:05.818 --> 28:09.321
- YEAH, YOU WOULD.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.991
TAKE WHAT YOU WANT AND TO HELL
WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.794
[sighs]

28:14.827 --> 28:16.829
SO YOU WERE NEVER
GOING TO TELL ME?

28:16.863 --> 28:19.265
- TELL YOU WHAT?
- YOU KNOW GODDAMN WELL.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.068
- IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.
WHO GIVES A SHIT?

28:22.101 --> 28:25.137
I DON'T. HE DOESN'T.
WHY DO YOU?

28:25.171 --> 28:28.474
- BECAUSE HE'S MY BOYFRIEND?

28:28.507 --> 28:31.844
AND YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

28:32.912 --> 28:36.282
- SOMEBODY'S JEALOUS.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.987
BUT ARE YOU JEALOUS

28:41.020 --> 28:44.857
BECAUSE I DID IT
WITH HIM

28:44.891 --> 28:47.994
OR BECAUSE
HE DID IT WITH ME?

28:48.027 --> 28:49.829
- ARROGANT PRICK.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.865
- WELL, WHICH IS IT?

28:52.899 --> 28:57.837
- WHY SHOULD I GIVE A SHIT
IF HE SLEPT WITH YOU?

28:57.870 --> 29:00.807
WHO HASN'T?

29:02.875 --> 29:07.213
- YOU.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.478
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:48.087 --> 29:51.891
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE?

29:51.924 --> 29:55.494
WELL, COME ON.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.

30:21.954 --> 30:25.024
- [panting]

30:28.027 --> 30:31.497
GET OUT OF HERE.

30:44.443 --> 30:48.247
- I KNOW YOUR
SECRET IDENTITY.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.989
[door closes]

31:07.934 --> 31:09.668
- HE WANTS ME
TO PIMP FOR HIM.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.238
THAT'S WHY I WAS INVITED
INTO THE INNER CIRCLE.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.040
- ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO RETURN THE PASTA MACHINE?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.507
- I THOUGHT WE AGREED,
RETURN THE PASTA MACHINE,

31:15.541 --> 31:17.143
KEEP THE CREPE MACHINE.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.377
- I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.112
THAT'S WHY I'M SUDDENLY
HIS NEW BEST FRIEND.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.981
- HEY, MY AUNT LOUISE
GAVE US THAT.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.315
- DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S TOTALLY OFFENSIVE?

31:23.349 --> 31:25.151
- OF COURSE I DO.
THAT'S WHY I'M RETURNING IT.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.652
- NO, I MEAN,
WHAT GARTH ASKED ME.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.254
- WELL, COME ON,
THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE

31:28.287 --> 31:29.655
ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN YOU
IF YOU'RE USEFUL TO THEM.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.124
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE USEFUL.
- YOU MEAN BEING USED.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.126
- THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
NOW YOU KNOW.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.128
YOU WANT SOMETHING OUT OF THEM,
THEY WANT SOMETHING OUT OF YOU.

31:36.162 --> 31:41.000
IT'S YOUR CALL
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THAT GAME.

31:41.033 --> 31:44.170
OY.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.572
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T GIVE OUT
THAT KIND OF INFORMATION.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.942
I PROMISE, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL THE POLICE.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.277
GIRL SCOUT'S HONOR.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.545
- COME ON, PHIL, YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.315
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHO THIS POOR KID IS.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.217
WON'T YOU HELP US?

31:58.250 --> 32:00.452
- YOU KNOW HOW MANY
ASTHMA PRESCRIPTIONS I GOT?

32:00.486 --> 32:03.522
- YOU GOT TIME.
MORE THAN HIM.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.727
[typing]

32:08.760 --> 32:11.497
MY STOMACH
IS IN FUCKING KNOTS.

32:11.530 --> 32:15.567
- HERE,
HAVE ONE OF THESE.

32:15.601 --> 32:20.072
- THAT'LL BE 79 CENTS.

32:21.540 --> 32:25.611
I MUST HAVE 100 NAMES HERE
JUST FOR ALBUTEROL.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.646
- SIS, THIS IS HOPELESS.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.449
- HEY, I NEVER
SAID THAT ABOUT YOU,

32:30.482 --> 32:34.453
SO YOU DON'T
SAY THAT ABOUT HIM.

32:34.486 --> 32:38.524
MM.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.192
- MIND IF I LOOK
AT THAT DRAWING AGAIN?

32:40.226 --> 32:44.230
- SURE.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.332
- HUH...

32:46.365 --> 32:49.335
THAT DIMPLE ON HIS CHIN
LOOKS FAMILIAR.

32:49.368 --> 32:53.739
- [sighs]
GOD BLESS SUNSHINE.

32:53.772 --> 32:58.477
- WHEN WAS HE KILLED?
- COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

32:58.510 --> 33:02.314
- WELL--
[clears throat]

33:05.317 --> 33:09.421
IF THIS IS HIM, HE NEVER
PICKED UP HIS PRESCRIPTION.

33:12.191 --> 33:16.495
[knocks on door]
- KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.497
- HI.
- HI. COME ON IN.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.765
- AH, THANKS.

33:19.798 --> 33:22.034
- YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR A FACIAL.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.369
- OH, NO, THANK YOU.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.238
- YOU SURE? YOU LOOK
A LITTLE STRESSED OUT.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.240
IT'S THE BEST THING
FOR STRESS, ISN'T IT, TEDDY?

33:28.274 --> 33:30.142
- THE BEST.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.511
HE'S, UM, HE'S GOING THROUGH
AN IMAGE CRISIS.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.381
SO, I--I THOUGHT
A JOUR BE BEAUTE MIGHT HELP.

33:35.414 --> 33:36.648
- AH.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.185
SO I THOUGHT MICHAEL
MIGHT BE AT THE STORE.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.786
BUT IT WAS CLOSED.
HE'S NOT HERE?

33:40.819 --> 33:42.788
- NO.
NO, HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

33:42.821 --> 33:43.722
HIDE NOR HAIR.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.258
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE BEAVER?

33:46.292 --> 33:48.394
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE
I SHOULD, UH--

33:48.427 --> 33:52.064
- OH, YOU CAN TELL US.
- WE'RE HIS BEST FRIENDS.

33:52.098 --> 33:54.666
- [sighs]

33:54.700 --> 33:59.405
HE'S BEEN ACTING REALLY WEIRD
EVER SINCE HE FOUND OUT--

33:59.438 --> 34:01.607
- YOU AND BRIAN--
- FUCKED.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.275
- YEAH.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.311
- I KNEW IT.
- YEAH, SO DID I.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.213
- YOU KNEW WHAT?

34:07.246 --> 34:09.415
- NOTHING.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.718
- COME ON,
YOU GUYS, TELL ME.

34:12.751 --> 34:16.122
WERE THEY LOVERS?

34:18.457 --> 34:20.492
WHAT?

34:20.526 --> 34:24.330
- IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER
IF THEY HAD BEEN.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.597
THEN BRIAN
COULD'VE BROKEN HIS HEART

34:25.631 --> 34:27.766
AND MICHAEL
COULD'VE GOTTEN OVER HIM.

34:27.799 --> 34:31.770
- INSTEAD OF ALWAYS WONDERING
WHAT IT WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.747
[slaps down paper]

34:41.780 --> 34:44.816
- JASON KEMP.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.891
- HOW'D YOU GET THIS?
- IT'S CALLED PERSEVERANCE.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.661
YOU SHOULD TRY IT SOMETIME.

34:55.694 --> 34:58.197
I EVEN FOUND OUT
WHERE HE LIVED.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.665
VASELINE TOWER.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.333
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

35:01.367 --> 35:02.768
- THAT'S WHERE EVERY
YOUNG GAY BOY GOES

35:02.801 --> 35:06.805
WHEN HE FIRST
MOVES TO TOWN.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.775
- HUH, THANKS FOR THE LEAD.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.744
YOU COULD BE A DETECTIVE.

35:12.778 --> 35:16.582
- THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR JOB.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.756
- YOU ARE COMING TO
THE AMFAR BENEFIT, AREN'T YOU?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.358
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
I'LL BE THERE.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.760
- THERE'S A COCKTAIL
PARTY BEFOREHAND.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.396
FOR THE BENEFACTORS.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.798
- AND AFTERWARDS WE'RE HAVING
A FABULOUS LITTLE SUPPER.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.366
- JUST AN INTIMATE
GROUP OF US.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.569
- AT GARTH'S, OF COURSE.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.371
- TEDDY.

35:39.405 --> 35:43.742
I WANT TO THANK YOU, MAN,
FOR SETTING ME UP WITH REX.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.647
- ALL I SAID
WAS YOU'RE A FAN.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.583
- THAT BOY
HAS THE HOTTEST ASS.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.852
WEBSITE DIDN'T
DO IT JUSTICE.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.255
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE...

35:56.288 --> 35:58.257
SO HAPPY TOGETHER.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.392
- COME JOIN US.

36:00.426 --> 36:03.829
PUT THAT ON MY TAB.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.602
- * FAR BEYOND THIS PLACE

38:42.120 --> 38:45.323
