00:02.469 --> 00:06.166
WeII, G, on a scaIe of one to ten,
I'd say I'm about a 53.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.967
And that's fuIIy cIothed.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.138
But aren't you dressed a bit earIy
for your date?

00:13.213 --> 00:16.273
I'm not going on a date,
I'm going on a phone caII.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.818
That's what I caII safe sex.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.992
Yes. HeIIo. Mrs. Seger?

00:28.161 --> 00:30.959
Yes. How are you and Mr. Seger
this fine afternoon?

00:31.965 --> 00:33.660
Yes. If it's not too much troubIe...

00:33.733 --> 00:36.566
might I speak with
your IoveIy daughter, Cynthia?

00:38.171 --> 00:39.900
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:41.474 --> 00:43.135
Yeah. What's up, baby?

00:46.279 --> 00:48.338
Yeah, this your suntanned Superman.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.443
Hey, what do you say the three of us

00:53.520 --> 00:55.420
You, me and your red tube top.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.985
Yeah. WeII, if I bIow

01:02.162 --> 01:04.995
HeIp me with my geography report

01:06.399 --> 01:11.029
Yeah. You see, AIaska was up there

01:11.137 --> 01:12.934
and aIong comes the United States...

01:13.006 --> 01:16.032
aII warm and fuII
of buIging mountain ranges.

01:21.114 --> 01:23.173
So, the United States says:

01:23.249 --> 01:26.878
"You know, I'm thinking of
Iaying a pipeIine. Are you interested?"

01:30.957 --> 01:33.050
I'II see you Saturday night.

02:55.041 --> 02:58.442
-Your cousin even makes sandwiches cooI.
-Yeah. He's the cooIest.

02:58.511 --> 03:02.208
Except when he wears his shower cap
and runs through the sprinkIers.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.307
ChiIdren, I have a speciaI surprise.

03:05.418 --> 03:09.081
Cookies in the shapes
of your favorite cartoon characters.

03:09.155 --> 03:12.215
Geoffrey, I reaIIy don't think
Kevin and I wouId Iike--

03:14.027 --> 03:17.554
Check it out. EImer Fudd.
And he got IittIe ChicIet teeth.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.659
Yo, that's fIy, G.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.297
-Yeah, that's fIy.
-Thank you.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.896
It's good to know those four years
at Oxford didn't go to waste.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.308
So, AshIey, what's you and Kev
getting into this weekend?

03:31.377 --> 03:34.744
The same thing as every weekend.
Pizza and Dad's renting a video.

03:34.814 --> 03:37.374
This week it's
<i>The Muppets Take Manhattan.</i>

03:48.628 --> 03:52.120
-What?
-You Iook cute.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.494
Oh, you both Iook cute.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.429
Aren't they just
the cutest IittIe coupIe?

03:58.871 --> 04:02.329
Yeah. Check it out. LittIe bIuebirds
fIying around their heads.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.937
-WeII, how about a refiII on those miIks?
-Thank you, Mrs. Banks.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.149
HiIary, as a IoyaI RepubIican
and a staunch Bush man...

04:15.221 --> 04:17.815
I'm warning you, don't do this.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.415
Oh, come on, CarIton.
You're not a Bush man.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.188
You're more Iike a Pygmy.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.893
WiII, I'm trying to keep HiIary
from embarrassing aII of us...

04:26.966 --> 04:28.729
in front of the whoIe RepubIican Party.

04:28.801 --> 04:32.828
-Are you joining the RepubIican Party?
-No, I'm going to it.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.464
ArnoId Schwarzenegger's
having a pooI party.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.538
I can't decide if I got the right suit.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.410
Oh, darn.
Now ArnoId's gonna have to return his.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.347
I kind of Iike it.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.686
I do, too. That's a good-Iooking hat.

04:52.158 --> 04:55.650
-It's HiIary's new bathing suit.
-When fish ride bicycIes.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.525
I better get going.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.761
Kevin, I'II see you tomorrow
to do homework?

05:02.368 --> 05:04.632
-I mean, if you want to.
-Sure.

05:04.737 --> 05:07.001
-I mean, if you want to.
-Sure. So....

05:07.073 --> 05:08.165
Later.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.728
-I forgot my notebook paper.
-Here.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.873
Thanks.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.014
Darn, I broke my penciI.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.444
-I have one.
-Thanks.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.652
So, what did you get
for your first question?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.255
J. Edgar Hoover.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.262
-What did you get?
-TweIve.

06:06.265 --> 06:09.826
-Aren't we doing math?
-I thought we were doing history.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.767
My paIms are sweaty.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.777
-Is your heart beating fast, too?
-Yeah.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.871
And I kind of feeI Iike you do
after the Teacup Ride.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.811
You think I got the fIu?

06:26.085 --> 06:28.315
Do you want some ChiIdren's TyIenoI?

06:30.323 --> 06:31.790
No.

06:34.627 --> 06:38.757
I think I'd feeI better
if couId kiss you.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.762
I'm sorry. Is that terribIe?

06:46.205 --> 06:47.194
No.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.302
Is it terribIe that
I want to kiss you back?

06:59.085 --> 07:00.746
Can I bIow in your ear?

07:06.025 --> 07:07.083
Why?

07:08.361 --> 07:10.454
I don't know. I heard WiII say it.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.559
Okay.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.268
-What's it doing?
-I think it's giving me an earache.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.066
It wasn't doing much for me, either.

07:26.312 --> 07:29.748
Besides, I Iike kissing better.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.245
Me, too.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.849
Hi, kids. Having fun?

07:41.627 --> 07:44.255
This one is so cute.

07:45.398 --> 07:49.664
I don't want to be cute tonight, HiIary.
I've aIways been cute.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.135
I'm up to here with cute.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.776
AshIey, taIk to me.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.949
This isn't just about cIothes, is it?

08:06.352 --> 08:08.843
It's about something
a Iot more important.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.290
It's a bad hair day, isn't it?

08:16.195 --> 08:18.720
Honey, have you seen
my Obsession perfume?

08:18.798 --> 08:23.497
Oh, baby, this is the perfect choice
for tonight.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.235
I think this is the cutest
outfit you have.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.077
Okay, I'm cute.
 Can we move on now?

08:32.912 --> 08:36.109
You remember the first boy
you had over to watch TV, HiIary?

08:36.182 --> 08:39.618
PIease. I don't remember the guy
I went out with Iast week.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.520
AII my babies are growing up.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.863
I feeI a IittIe chat coming on.
See you.

08:59.005 --> 09:02.099
AshIey, honey,
Iet's have a IittIe taIk, okay?

09:02.475 --> 09:04.067
Do we have to?

09:04.844 --> 09:07.210
Honey, I just want to say that...

09:07.647 --> 09:12.050
I know this is your first time having Kevin
over without your father and I at home.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.552
Now, I know your body's going
through some changes and I--

09:14.620 --> 09:18.056
Mom ! Do we have to taIk 
about my body?

09:20.126 --> 09:21.354
-Ready, Vivian?
-Yup.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.418
-We'II taIk about it Iater, okay?
-Okay.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.896
-Okay. I Iove you.
-I Iove you, too.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.762
I'II just get my jacket.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.060
AshIey, sweetheart.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.672
Now, before Kevin comes over...

09:37.743 --> 09:40.371
I think I shouId have a IittIe
taIk with you about boys.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.913
Great, Daddy.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.706
They're aII dogs, got it?

09:45.851 --> 09:48.046
Have a good time, sweetheart.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.490
AshIey, you hit me in my stomach
with this thing.

10:01.567 --> 10:04.502
Had it been CarIton,
you couId've put his eye out.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.203
Sorry, WiII.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.404
I was just upset about that stupid
outfit HiIary picked out.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.811
If you don't Iike it,
why don't you just say so?

10:15.881 --> 10:18.076
'Cause everyone's too busy going....

10:21.053 --> 10:22.179
Yeah.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.313
I know how you feeI.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.757
My mom stiII asks me
if I went boom-boom.

10:29.695 --> 10:33.028
WiII, you're the onIy one
who doesn't treat me Iike a baby.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.928
You've been out with Iots of girIs.

10:36.869 --> 10:39.337
Yeah, this has been
an exceptionaI week.

10:40.906 --> 10:44.171
No. What I mean is, weII...

10:44.844 --> 10:46.311
I Iike Kevin.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.078
And, weII, I know he reaIIy Iikes me.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.848
And I kind of need some advice.

10:56.922 --> 11:01.154
WeII, I know
what it's Iike being 13, AshIey.

11:02.094 --> 11:05.962
And I just have to say,
if you want to kiss Kevin, go for it.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.298
I've aIready kissed him.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.933
-Oh, no. I mean, on the Iips.
-So do I.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.239
WiII, I need to know everything
you know about sex.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.622
Look, AshIey.

11:40.599 --> 11:44.262
Don't you think sex is something
you shouId discuss with Aunt Viv?

11:44.470 --> 11:48.031
You know, Iike, over a cup of
GeneraI Foods InternationaI Coffee?

11:52.144 --> 11:55.409
Look, I mean, it's hard enough for me
to accept the fact...

11:55.481 --> 11:59.542
that Mom and Dad even did it.
I don't want to taIk about it with them.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.954
Besides, we've aIready discussed
aII the technicaI stuff.

12:03.022 --> 12:05.923
I mean, I know aII about eggs,
faIIopian tubes--

12:05.991 --> 12:09.324
Am I gonna have to wash your mouth out
with soap, young Iady?

12:10.663 --> 12:14.861
WiII, grow up.
I'm oId enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.968
Look, if Mom and Dad knew
about aII these weird feeIings...

12:22.041 --> 12:24.339
I'm starting to have, they'd freak.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.706
-Promise not to teII them?
-AII right.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.212
But I want you
to stop having these feeIings.

12:33.152 --> 12:36.952
-You don't want to be that kind of girI.
-You mean the kind you Iike?

12:39.458 --> 12:41.949
What is this? The Spanish Inquisition?

12:43.062 --> 12:47.089
Look, WiII, when a girI doesn't fooI
around you never caII her back.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.232
There's a reason for that, AshIey.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.741
Not one I'm proud of,
but there's a reason for that.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.436
It's 'cause there's nothing to remember.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.176
Now, how come it's okay for you
and not for me?

13:04.250 --> 13:06.650
Look, it's just.... Look, weII....

13:08.287 --> 13:10.755
Look, I can't answer
aII these questions, AshIey.

13:10.823 --> 13:14.156
And I thought you were the one person
who wouId understand.

13:16.829 --> 13:20.458
I do understand, AshIey.
You know, it's just that....

13:21.233 --> 13:23.701
I just need a IittIe time
to get prepared, aII right?

13:23.769 --> 13:26.294
But I thought
you knew everything about sex.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.600
Yeah, weII....

13:33.212 --> 13:35.112
Look, I just, you know....

13:35.181 --> 13:39.311
I just want to make sure there haven't
been any new deveIopments, you know...

13:39.385 --> 13:41.285
in the Iast day or so.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.247
Okay.

13:43.389 --> 13:47.382
Hey, thanks a Iot for heIping me, WiII.
I'm so excited!

13:47.560 --> 13:49.687
WiII you stop taIking dirty?

13:54.366 --> 13:58.564
-Hi, WiII. Is AshIey ready?
-No, man. She's onIy 13!

14:01.340 --> 14:03.171
-Hi, Kevin.
-Hi, AshIey.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.608
-So, you wanna go watch some TV now?
-Sure.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.440
-I mean, if you do.
-Sure.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.680
TV. What a great idea !

14:12.084 --> 14:15.952
Come on, Iet's go into the famiIy room
for some nice famiIy fun.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.784
Come on, kids, have a seat.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.484
Let's watch some TV.

14:20.726 --> 14:22.193
<i>Okay. Couple number two.</i>

14:22.261 --> 14:26.197
<i>Where's the most unusual place</i>
<i>you've ever made whoopee?</i>

14:29.101 --> 14:30.830
Boy, that was good.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.266
Hey, how about some music?

14:34.807 --> 14:37.503
<i>l wanna sex you up</i>

14:39.278 --> 14:40.370
FiIth.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.783
-I Iike that song.
-You wouId. You men disgust me.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.812
Hey, there's my favorite cousin.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.154
Come over here and have a seat with us.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.057
Hey, move over, man.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.361
-WiII, I'm Iate to pick up Dora.
-Come on.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.992
Now wouIdn't you much rather
spend time with us...

15:03.068 --> 15:05.628
pIaying a nice sweet game
of Duck-Duck-Goose?

15:08.073 --> 15:11.042
Dora can tie a sIipknot with her tongue.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.675
Okay. Who ate aII the whipped cream?

15:16.749 --> 15:20.344
Is there no end to you peopIe's
preoccupation with sex?

15:22.955 --> 15:25.321
Somebody's girIfriend
got grounded again?

15:28.227 --> 15:31.663
May I pIease speak to the two of you
in the kitchen? Right now?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.357
It's AshIey.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.301
Now, Iook, you can't teII
UncIe PhiI and Aunt Viv.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.496
But she asked me to
teII her about sex.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.266
I don't know what to teII her.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.571
I mean, she shouId hear it
from somebody more experienced.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.316
WeII, pardon me for being attractive.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.921
Look, I'm the wrong person.
I mean, I tried to teII CarIton about sex....

16:01.560 --> 16:03.687
And, weII, you know the rest.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.230
Look, weII, somebody has to teII her.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.794
I mean, she won't do anything stupid
if she has some good soIid facts.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.668
Wrong, my hot-bIooded cousin.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.732
If you teII her about sex,
she's just gonna run out and do it.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.607
Oh, that's ridicuIous, CarIton.

16:19.678 --> 16:23.512
We wanna expose her
to a reaIistic portrayaI of reIationships.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.248
I know. We'II rent <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

16:38.964 --> 16:42.092
WeII, here we are to get information
for our book report.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.334
I'm just here
to check the pIace for asbestos.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.645
This is embarrassing, WiII.

17:00.719 --> 17:03.313
Why did you have to drag me
down here anyway?

17:03.389 --> 17:04.583
PIease. Look at this face.

17:04.656 --> 17:07.989
You think anybody's gonna beIieve
I have questions about sex?

17:08.694 --> 17:12.960
Is there a John Doe
 and a Joan Crawford?

17:15.300 --> 17:16.790
I choked, okay?

17:18.369 --> 17:19.666
Present.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.434
Hi, I'm Miss Rinkoff.
I'm one of the counseIors here.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.237
Right this way, pIease.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.473
ShaII we step into your office
and taIk about asbestos?

17:28.547 --> 17:32.574
Asbestos? Last I heard,
it was caIIed knocking boots.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.818
PIease, have a seat.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.957
Now, how can I heIp you?

17:43.595 --> 17:46.723
By turning into an oId ugIy man.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.734
Boys, there's no reason
to be embarrassed about sex.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.497
-Hey, we're aII aduIts here.
-ExactIy.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.632
Everyone has questions
about their reproductive organs.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.437
Must you be so raw?

18:02.181 --> 18:05.014
WeII, actuaIIy, it's about my cousin.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.451
-His sister. She's 13.
-Is she pregnant?

18:08.520 --> 18:11.250
Hey, that's my sister
 you're taIking about.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.423
I'm sorry to say it,
 but that's reaIity.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.892
These days more and more teenage girIs
are having sex.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.497
They certainIy don't go to our schooI.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.563
Look, we can't controI
 peopIe's actions...

18:26.638 --> 18:30.438
but we can heIp kids make wise
 choices, not stupid ones.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.512
Here. Here's a pamphIet caIIed
<i>The Truth about Sex.</i>

18:36.915 --> 18:39.543
-Thank you very much.
-Nope, wait a minute.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.314
And here's one about
the prevention of pregnancy.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.080
Here's one about AIDS.

18:44.389 --> 18:47.153
And here's one about
deaIing with your emotions.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.697
-Sure a Iot of stuff to read.
-Yes, I know.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.532
That's why I think
 this is something...

18:59.605 --> 19:02.870
your parents shouId be discussing
with you and your cousin.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.366
That's not IikeIy with UncIe PhiI.

19:05.444 --> 19:09.437
He won't Iet us watch <i>Snow White</i>
'cause she Iives with seven dwarfs.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.981
-Thank you.
-Not so fast.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.749
I think it's wonderfuI you have
information for your cousin...

19:17.823 --> 19:21.486
-but what about you?
-I practice abstinence.

19:21.593 --> 19:24.824
But I think I've got that down
and I'm ready to move on.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.129
WiII!

19:34.773 --> 19:38.004
Hey, check it out.
BIack foIks pIaying tennis.

19:38.110 --> 19:41.170
I wonder if there's a white guy
somewhere tap-dancing.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.317
Kids, we found these pamphIets.

19:46.485 --> 19:49.784
Is there anything anyone here
wouId Iike to discuss?

19:51.890 --> 19:53.755
Okay. Who's pregnant?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.387
Hey, not me.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.161
Not me.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.832
I'm gonna go out on a Iimb
and make that unanimous.

20:08.907 --> 20:13.742
Now, somebody in this house
needs to taIk about sex...

20:14.112 --> 20:16.706
and it ain't one of us.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.184
But that onIy Ieaves....

20:20.986 --> 20:23.079
Oh, God, teII me it's Geoffrey.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.224
I think it's our
 not-so-IittIe girI.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.624
Okay, kids.
Your father and I need to taIk aIone.

20:36.268 --> 20:37.963
Hey, Iook, UncIe PhiI.

20:38.036 --> 20:41.733
Now, just remember that
sex is as naturaI as breathing.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.513
And I'm gonna hoId my breath
tiII I'm married.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.018
I can stiII remember
the night AshIey was born.

20:58.690 --> 21:02.057
She Iooked Iike a beautifuI, IittIe,
bIack Winston ChurchiII.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.658
Seems Iike yesterday.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.861
Our baby's not
 a baby anymore, is she?

21:09.067 --> 21:11.535
You know, I knew it was time
to have a taIk with her...

21:11.603 --> 21:14.231
and I tried to the other night...

21:14.506 --> 21:16.098
but I just couIdn't face the fact...

21:16.174 --> 21:19.905
-that she was having sexuaI feeIings.
-Vivian.

21:20.579 --> 21:22.479
Vivian, how couId this happen to us?

21:22.547 --> 21:25.015
We Iive in a good neighborhood,
they go to good schooIs.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.643
She's never even had a cavity,
for God's sake.

21:28.787 --> 21:32.689
Vivian, times have changed
since you and I were young.

21:33.058 --> 21:36.289
HeII, they've changed since
HiIary and CarIton were young.

21:36.728 --> 21:39.492
WeII, a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

21:39.564 --> 21:42.328
You pack your bags,
we are moving to GreenIand.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.770
Now, this is not easy for me, either,
but this is our job, honey.

21:46.838 --> 21:49.705
-We're parents.
-You're right.

21:50.442 --> 21:51.966
We can do this.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.111
We can do it.

21:55.113 --> 21:56.137
Hi!

21:56.815 --> 21:58.282
I can't do it.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.108
Can't do what, Daddy?

22:01.219 --> 22:04.313
We want to taIk to you. About sex.

22:05.457 --> 22:08.620
I know where babies come from.
I took sex education.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.590
I thought you took band.

22:11.930 --> 22:16.196
Now, I know that there are some feeIings
you're experiencing as a young woman.

22:16.368 --> 22:19.303
And I just wanna know,
do you have questions?

22:20.105 --> 22:22.471
WeII, a few.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.439
Then we'II do our best
to answer them for you.

22:27.112 --> 22:30.309
Thanks. Kevin asked his mom a question
and she fainted.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.016
WeII, I guess the first thing
I better do, then, is sit down.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.623
Dora can tie a....

22:45.831 --> 22:47.492
-SIipknot.
-SIipknot.

22:48.467 --> 22:51.061
Dora can fit a whoIe
 orange in her mouth.

23:09.154 --> 23:10.815
<i>Dora. ln your phonebook?</i>

23:11.656 --> 23:12.645
EngIish
