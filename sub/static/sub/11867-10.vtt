00:00.959 --> 00:02.620
HENRY: Previously on Eureka.

00:02.669 --> 00:04.921
You may get to him,
but you won't get to me.

00:05.047 --> 00:08.039
There's only one thing
I want from you, Jojo.

00:08.759 --> 00:09.839
CARTER:
What, what is that?

00:09.885 --> 00:11.796
It's a modified version
of the memory neutralizer

00:11.845 --> 00:14.257
that I designed years ago.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.389
Sure.

00:17.809 --> 00:21.677
We've been searching
for a unifying theory
of everything.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.347
You're talking
about the Akashic Field.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.437
ljust wish I could see
what was going on
inside of his head.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.234
Why is this
happening to him?

00:29.321 --> 00:31.903
His brain is wired
like no one else's.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.027
He's created
a connection
to the field.

00:39.498 --> 00:43.036
HARPER: Albert Einstein said,
"Science without religion
is lame."

00:43.210 --> 00:45.542
And "Religion without
science is blind."

00:46.964 --> 00:52.334
But is there still
a place for faith
in a world of science?

00:54.012 --> 00:58.676
Has our ability to unravel
the mysteries of rainbows

00:59.351 --> 01:01.763
made them any
less miraculous?

01:03.313 --> 01:07.682
Science may be the method
by which we give name
to God's miracles,

01:07.943 --> 01:10.650
but faith is the question
that arises

01:10.988 --> 01:13.570
every time
an old mystery
is solved.

01:14.575 --> 01:18.864
The elegant explanations
discovered every day
in Eureka

01:19.413 --> 01:22.746
are the very
reason to believe
in something greater.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.249
Something beyond mathematics.
Something divine.

01:46.148 --> 01:49.515
ANNOUNCER ON TV:
Here ’5 the windup
and the pitch.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.568
And there's a shot
by Martinez
out to right ﬁeld.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.111
Dad?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.702
Hey. What are you
doing here?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.573
l was just cleaning out
my closet for donations,
as requested.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.080
And, I brought
you breakfast.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.792
Thank you.
Uh, what is it?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.627
Scrambled egg whites
with spinach and tofu.

02:14.718 --> 02:18.256
SARAH said your
cholesterol's been running
high from too much pizza.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.640
Ah, that's crazy talk.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.216
Oh. Almost forgot.
I got you your Sunday paper.
Here you go.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.645
What do you want?
Who said
I want anything?

02:29.691 --> 02:32.433
lt's Sunday morning.
You're up before noon.
You're doing chores.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.189
You're bringing me
the morning paper.
What do you want?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.320
Okay.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.573
(CLEARING THROAT)
I want to get a tattoo.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.321
(LAUGHING)

02:41.703 --> 02:43.113
No.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.494
Okay,
I'm being serious.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.572
Oh, okay. No.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.998
Can we talk
about this?

02:48.043 --> 02:52.332
Sure. Yeah.
We can talk about it.
And the answer is no.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.001
Are you amused
with yourself?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.836
Well, I'm pretty amusing.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.422
Got to drop this off.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.680
Oh! I am so
telling SARAH.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.353
Thought provoking
sermon, Reverend.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.853
I mean, the most
beautiful emotion

03:14.903 --> 03:17.986
we can experience
is the mysterious?
I couldn't agree more.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.401
Unfortunately,
I'm literally preaching
to the choir.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.074
Well, you knew you were going
to have a small crowd
when you took the job.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.493
It's not the size
of the congregation
that counts.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.450
It's their commitment.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.827
Still, a little
more size could
be nice.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.250
(ALL LAUGHING)

03:32.629 --> 03:33.869
Mom?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.580
And a little more time.
Excuse me, Reverend. Henry.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.557
Hi.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.142
Diane. Another lovely
musical arrangement.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.432
Thank you very much,
Reverend.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.055
How are you?

03:49.312 --> 03:51.974
Hanging in there.
You know, working helps.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.225
Tell me about it.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.981
Any time you need
to talk, drop by.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.692
lwill. Thanks.
Bye, Henry.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.399
Bye-bye.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.908
Not many people can
understand the pain
of losing a spouse.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.824
Well, we all deal
in our own way.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.575
Still, I'm glad you've
been there for her.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.167
Yeah. Me, too. Thanks.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.663
See you next Sunday? Okay.
Absolutely.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.794
Sheriff Carter.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.345
Hi.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.798
You're early,
for next Sunday.

04:28.810 --> 04:34.055
Yeah, um, it's Jo's day off,
and I drew the short straw.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.935
So, what have
you got there?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.849
Donations.
Spring cleaning.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.936
We'll make sure
we get these
to those in need.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.490
A lot of need.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.111
Yeah. Hey, oh.
That's not even mine.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.658
(CHUCKLING)

04:49.498 --> 04:51.910
[blame you
for her death.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.908
I can't look at you without
thinking that you're
the one who did this.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.703
That you're the one
who took her away
from me.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.542
You okay, Sheriff?

04:59.633 --> 05:03.501
l... Yeah.
I just remembered
who I borrowed this from.

05:03.595 --> 05:07.634
Well, if you ever want
to borrow my book...

05:08.892 --> 05:10.007
Yeah.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.557
See you next
Sunday, maybe?

05:11.812 --> 05:16.932
I'll work on it.
I'll put these
up front for you.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.685
(LAUGHING)

05:25.158 --> 05:26.318
(ZOE LAUGHING)

05:26.409 --> 05:28.320
I kind of wish
I hadn't even told him.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.533
SARAH: I don 't understand
the appeal of painting
oneself permanent/y.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.456
Maybe because in
your case, it would
be considered graffiti.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.617
(LAUGHING)

05:36.670 --> 05:38.831
I thought every kid
from LA had a tattoo.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.163
Oh, yeah.
And preschoolers
have body piercings.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.338
(LAUGHING)

05:42.384 --> 05:44.716
Haven't you guys
ever been to, like,
a big city?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.088
Nope.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.012
Oh, we did have
that one wild
weekend in Vegas.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.343
(LAUGHING) We did.
Really?

05:51.476 --> 05:53.307
Okay, so, it was
a virtual Vegas.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.809
But it was like
we were really there.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.811
Okay, you guys
really need
to get out more.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.774
I'll tell you what.
This weekend, we'll take
my car and we'll head up to...

06:03.196 --> 06:05.903
Well, what? Don't
leave us in suspense.
Spit it out.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.652
(WHISPERING)

06:07.742 --> 06:09.243
Zoe, what's wrong?

06:09.327 --> 06:10.442
(WHISPERS) I can't talk.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.323
SARAH: Should I alert
Sheriff Carter?

06:14.708 --> 06:15.697
Zoe?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.958
(INAUDIBLE)

06:19.337 --> 06:21.669
SARAH: Zoe? Pi/ar?
What’s happening?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.380
(INAUDIBLE)

06:24.593 --> 06:25.673
SARAH: Zoe?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.839
(INAUDIBLE)

07:08.094 --> 07:09.834
What exactly
are you doing?

07:10.055 --> 07:14.344
It's a portable MRI.
It allows me to see
inside her throat.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.939
You're making her nervous.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.517
Just tell me what's
wrong with her.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.473
I don't know.
It's not laryngitis.

07:23.568 --> 07:27.277
They're all suffering
from some sort of
vocal chord paralysis.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.778
From what?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.108
I'm not sure yet.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.525
Okay, I'll hang out
while you tinker
with her voice box.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.194
I don't tinker.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.956
Carter, just give
him some time.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.453
Yeah.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.790
I know. I know.
Me, too.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.799
Everything's going
to be all right.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.630
He's pretty good
at what he does.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.929
We're going to keep Zoe
and the other girls here
for observation at G.D.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.215
until we have an answer.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.424
Okay.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.808
I'm going to
check out the house.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.764
Just see if
I can find anything.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.518
I already sent
a science team.
They can handle it.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.020
Yeah. I prefer to do
my own digging.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.644
So, I'll see you
soon,okay?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.485
What is that?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.157
What...

08:19.666 --> 08:20.655
What?

08:20.750 --> 08:25.835
You... Oh, God!
So, you weren't asking for
permission to get a tattoo.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.665
You were just
covering your ass.
Right? It... Zoe...

08:29.759 --> 08:31.715
(SIGHING)

08:31.803 --> 08:36.547
Okay. You know, I'm just
going to do everything
I can to get you healthy.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.553
And then we're gonna
talk about that. Okay?

08:44.649 --> 08:48.187
So, uh,
Sunday special
is Fallout Flapjacks.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.649
That's pumpkin pancakes
with a radioactive swirl
of cream cheese and nutmeg.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.360
Well, that sounds great.
Thanks. But I'm waiting
for somebody.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.033
Really?
Who's the lucky lady?

09:03.752 --> 09:04.992
No.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.876
Yes.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.085
I'm impressed.

09:08.173 --> 09:12.212
So am I. And just
a teeny bit scared.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.292
Yeah.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.547
Wow.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.380
If all church girls
looked like you,
I might consider converting.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.262
Well, you should
join me some time
and find out.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.138
Oh, I would,
but I'm allergic.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.480
I'd have to get
a new inhaler.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.179
It would be
a whole thing.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.733
Uh-huh.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.932
After you.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.689
Chivalry.
Not something I was
expecting from a felon.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.070
(CHUCKLING)
Hey, never convicted.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.772
But the day
is still young.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.074
Try anything,
and I'll deviate
your septum.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.615
That is so hot.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.785
(LAUGHING)

09:41.873 --> 09:45.161
SARAH: I ’m sorry, Sheriff.
It was my responsibility
to keep an eye on them,

09:45.251 --> 09:47.503
and I failed.
Bad house.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.248
It's all right, SARAH.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.585
One minute, they were
talking about tattoos.
The next, they couldn't speak.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.251
I was against her
getting one, by the way.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.253
Well, not that it helped,
but thanks.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.679
Did you run tests
on the air?

09:59.766 --> 10:00.755
Did you check the filters?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.636
If anything unusual
had been detected,

10:02.727 --> 10:04.934
I would have sealed off
the affected areas.

10:05.522 --> 10:09.686
Okay. Um...
Where were they?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.225
In the living room.

10:15.698 --> 10:16.983
(SIGHING)

10:27.293 --> 10:29.124
What is that?

10:29.212 --> 10:33.626
I don ’t know.
It wasn't there before.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.711
Neither was that.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.968
Well, this is, uh,
truly a mystery.
This shouldn't happen.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.470
Crystalline glass
is made up of atoms

10:48.523 --> 10:50.479
that bond with more density
than ordinary glass.

10:50.525 --> 10:54.234
Making windows stronger,
more light-resistant,
more thermally efficient.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.527
So, what could do it?
It would take an
incredible heat source.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.321
Well, SARAH checked.
She said there was no trace
of heat anywhere in the house.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.524
Like I said.
It's a mystery.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.698
Henry, I need help.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.493
Zoe can't talk.
You've checked
G.D.'s entire...

11:04.581 --> 11:06.196
ALLISON: Yeah.
Active project roster.
Of course.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.623
But there is nothing
that would cause
a problem like this.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.078
Well, something caused it.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.037
Jack.
We're doing all we can,
as fast as we can.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.623
Okay.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.634
So, why does
a Special Forces badass
quit a life of excitement

11:19.679 --> 11:21.795
to become the deputy
of Sleepy Hollow?

11:21.848 --> 11:24.430
Same reason
an anti-establishment
anarchist

11:24.517 --> 11:27.475
agrees to a cushy
consulting job
at Global Dynamics.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.509
The money?

11:28.605 --> 11:30.061
Because you wouldn't believe
what they're paying me.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.763
Well, the opportunity.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.395
You know, this isn't
just anywhere.
It's Eureka.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.361
True. If I'd come here sooner,
things may have turned out
differently for me.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.239
Like you wouldn't
have gone to MIT
when you were 15?

11:41.326 --> 11:44.693
Actually, MIT was great.
I could spend weeks at a time

11:44.746 --> 11:48.534
focused on a single variable
in a lattice gauge equation.
It was heaven.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.117
I had the same feeling
assembling a chromium flash
suppression barrel

11:52.212 --> 11:53.873
for my grenade launcher.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.208
Yeah. But that's
simple mechanics.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.501
Particle and
theoretical physics?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.836
That's the real mind candy.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.045
Well, some of us like
practical application.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.256
Oh, yeah. No.
That's all good.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.467
But, I mean, let's be honest.
That particle accelerator?

12:08.561 --> 12:12.349
It only gets built
after someone comes up
with the idea. Right?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.901
So, how about
a Vinspresso
to top things off?

12:19.739 --> 12:22.856
That's an excellent idea. Jo?

12:23.451 --> 12:24.782
No, thanks.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.825
I should be getting
back to the office.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.074
I thought you
had Sundays off.

12:29.374 --> 12:33.333
Yeah. ljust remembered
I have some papenNork
I forgot to finish.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.373
Thanks for brunch.

ﬁnd the cause.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.100
But the good news is
it’s not getting
any worse.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.431
VVeH,Iguess
that's something.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.771
You doing okay?

12:55.900 --> 13:00.985
Yeah. Just seeing Carter
so worried about Zoe
just got to me.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.195
I know how he feels.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.523
Well, try to relax.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.653
You're under
a lot of stress, lately.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.609
I'll keep at it
until I figure
something out.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.948
I know you will.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.256
Hey, there.
Welcome back.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.849
What's happening to me?

14:13.895 --> 14:17.058
Well, apparently
your inner glow
is becoming your outer glow.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.348
Please don't joke.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.688
What were you doing
before this happened?

14:23.488 --> 14:26.480
I helped Kevin
with his homework.
Then I took a shower.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.274
So Kevin was home.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.529
Yeah. Why?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.156
I wonder if he
was responsible.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.991
Well, why would he...
I don't know.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.198
But we've seen
what kind of power he has.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.208
If I'm right,
and he's tapping into
the Akashic Field,

14:39.253 --> 14:43.246
then he's tapping
into a very powerful
energy collective.

14:48.388 --> 14:53.303
Holy crap!
What did you do?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.262
I took a shower.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.719
You look radiant.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.056
We tested the water.
There's nothing there that
could cause bioluminescence.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.401
How does that happen?

15:02.485 --> 15:07.070
Enzymes in the skin
pigment become oxidized
and then they emit light.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.738
Yeah, but that's with insects
and marine life.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.493
Not anymore.
It might be some kind
of bacterial reaction.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.241
Okay, you know what,
glowing or not,
I'm still the head of G.D.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.412
Unless this is contagious...

15:17.458 --> 15:18.914
No. No. No.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.825
Oh! I got you.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.660
NATHAN: The human body
is not built for this.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.370
Whatever's causing
your bioluminescence

15:24.424 --> 15:26.130
is also attacking
your nervous system.

15:26.217 --> 15:30.426
Allison, does G.D. have any
projects in bioluminescence
in development?

15:30.847 --> 15:33.839
Not at G.D.
But maybe off-site.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.595
And you're not going to like
who the project manager is.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.771
Why do you automatically
assume I'm responsible?

15:41.858 --> 15:44.065
Are you really
surprised?

15:44.485 --> 15:46.225
I work in bioluminescence
now, Sheriff.

15:46.279 --> 15:50.318
Ever since you torched
my necrosomnium vio/acea,
I needed a change of scenery.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.488
Hmm...

15:51.576 --> 15:54.693
I'm a busy man.
Do you mind
getting to the point?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.490
The point is
that Allison Blake

15:56.581 --> 15:58.617
is shining like
the northern lights.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.292
Fascinating.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.786
Seth, what's the
new project?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.873
Botanical and marine
cross-hybridization

16:04.964 --> 16:06.920
to create
bioluminescent specimens.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.252
I mate plants and fish
to make them glow.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.379
Why would you do that?

16:14.474 --> 16:15.839
That's classified.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.767
The head of Global Dynamics
is a human glow stick,
so unclassify it.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.853
I've only just isolated
the mitochondrial strains

16:22.940 --> 16:24.931
responsible
for bioluminescence.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.940
Phase one includes
simple organisms.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.272
Let me guess.
Phase two is human trials.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.404
Well, yeah.
But I'm years
away from that.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.197
I'm still going
to need a sample.

don't leave the aquarium.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.240
At least you can't
light it on fire.

Hey. Sorry I couldn't
be here sooner.
You okay?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.687
Well, we're still going
over the Smart House,
and Fargo is running

17:04.774 --> 17:06.856
a full diagnostic
on SARAH.

17:06.901 --> 17:10.485
Okay, so don't worry.
We'll find something soon.

How did it go with Zane?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.616
We can talk
about that later.

Or now.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.869
Or now.

But how long before
he realizes

17:51.862 --> 17:54.023
I can't keep up with him?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.109
Anyway, I'm more
concerned about you.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.828
I'll live.
I ’m worried about Allison.

Yeah, I know. Me, too.

you show up, my work
gets ruined?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.626
I'm not the one
who turned your aquarium

18:47.710 --> 18:50.292
into a theme park
for The Shining.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.876
I didn't do this.
This just happened.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.207
This doesn't just happen.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.971
Blood?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.181
That's what you're
thinking, right?

19:05.269 --> 19:06.349
Yeah.

19:06.437 --> 19:09.019
Great. Then, you
can deal with this.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.142
I don't do blood.
I'm a plant guy.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.315
What's that?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.811
SETH:
It's a filtration system.
Or it was.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.239
You know, there was
a hole like that
at the Smart House.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.692
What does that
have to do with this?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.990
Exactly.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.620
Hey! Who's going
to fix my tank?

19:26.666 --> 19:27.701
No one.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.999
This just became
a crime scene.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.386
Well, we didn't
notice any before.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.927
Yeah, well,
we weren't really looking.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.055
Bingo.
So everything that's
happened is related?

19:52.817 --> 19:55.775
Yeah. I'm not
sure to what.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.937
HENRY: What did
you ﬁnd out?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.896
The Smart House had
a circle of melted glass.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.824
As did Allison's house
and Seth's aquarium.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.367
What happened
at the aquarium?

20:05.413 --> 20:07.950
The water
in the marine tanks
turned to blood,

20:08.040 --> 20:09.450
or a blood-like substance.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.032
Did you test the water?

20:11.085 --> 20:14.248
Yeah, and it didn't match
when we compared it
to her chem panel.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.870
How bad is she?

20:15.965 --> 20:17.626
Whatever's triggering
Allison's bioluminescence

20:17.717 --> 20:19.628
is working as a neurotoxin.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.175
It's shutting down
her bodily systems.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.677
Now, the reason
I brought her here
is I've been working on

20:23.723 --> 20:25.634
a nerve agent antidote
for the military.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.465
Can you give it
to her?

does she have?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.100
Twelve hours.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.155
Maybe less.

A few?

21:09.393 --> 21:10.724
Yeah.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.431
Yeah, we're going
to figure this out.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.309
You're going
to be fine. Okay? But...

21:16.609 --> 21:18.224
(SIGHING)

21:19.862 --> 21:23.650
About your tattoo.
I overreacted.

21:24.450 --> 21:28.363
I didn't hear you out.
And that's...

21:30.414 --> 21:31.529
I'm sorry.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.908
I mean, I do think
what you did was wrong.

21:36.629 --> 21:40.167
But it's a tattoo.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.342
That's just not
important anymore.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.930
I think you should
just focus on
getting better, okay?

21:51.352 --> 21:53.468
Am I going to die?

21:54.396 --> 21:59.060
No. Iwas trying to...
l was just...
No, you're not going to die.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.479
We've got it
all under control.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.186
Just hang on a second. Okay?

22:05.658 --> 22:06.693
I hope you have
some good news.

22:06.784 --> 22:07.819
Yeah, but you
were right.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.946
All the glass melted
the same way.
From the inside out.

22:09.995 --> 22:13.283
And all the locations affected
were using crystalline glass.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.914
I guess that's why
every window in Eureka
didn't go all Salvador Dali.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.083
Exactly. So, I'm going
to run this data
with Nathan.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.286
Maybe this is the break
we've been looking for.
Great.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.172
Hey, thanks.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.041
Keep the faith.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.545
Believe me, I'm trying.

22:29.348 --> 22:34.559
Well, Henryjust
figured something out
that might help us.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.728
So, you just hang
in there. Okay?

22:47.616 --> 22:51.029
Hey, Larry.
Studying to be Pope?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.871
No.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.037
But with what's
happening around town,

22:55.124 --> 22:58.366
I thought
I should cover my bases,
religion-wise.

22:58.419 --> 23:01.161
What's religion have
to do with anything?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.955
Well, call it what you like,
but girls losing their voices?

23:04.049 --> 23:06.836
That's like
the Tower of Babel.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.378
God smote those workers
so they couldn't communicate.

23:10.431 --> 23:14.925
And Dr. Blake glowing?
Like saints rising to Heaven?

23:15.019 --> 23:19.558
That's what the Bible
calls transfiguration.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.933
What if G.D. was built
over a hellmouth?

23:24.403 --> 23:26.268
A "hellmouth"?
Say what you want.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.901
But when water turns to blood,
I say it's time to pray.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.653
You might want
to run that one
by the Reverend.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.280
I'm sure she'll get
a laugh out of it.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.495
Well, considering
she's the one I borrowed
these books from,

23:36.582 --> 23:38.789
I think I'll stick
to my game plan.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.745
Harper gave you these?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.372
She's giving them
to everyone.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.254
Things are happening
all over town.

23:45.299 --> 23:49.668
In case you haven't noticed,
God's come to Eureka.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.176
Thanks.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.219
For what?

23:53.265 --> 23:56.257
Well, you may have
pointed me down the
path of righteousness.

23:56.352 --> 23:57.637
Hallelujah, my brother.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.264
Shut up, Larry.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.440
(ORGAN PLAYING)

24:11.158 --> 24:13.900
Hi. Excuse me.
Do you know where
I can find the Reverend?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.990
She just stepped out,
but she'll be back
for evening service.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.618
And all these people?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.536
They've just come here
to pray on their own.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.616
Sure.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.160
People seek comfort
in times of crisis.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.711
And Reverend Harper's
door is always open.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.084
How long have you
known the Reverend?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.796
I've been the church's
musical director
since day one. So a while.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.509
Don't take this
the wrong way,

24:33.597 --> 24:35.133
but I hear
the Sunday sermons

24:35.224 --> 24:37.089
aren't quite selling out.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.054
Please.
Sure. Sure.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.931
Eureka's built
on science.

24:42.106 --> 24:46.645
So it's hard for people here
to just open up to something
as uncertain as faith.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.519
Reverend Harper was a
theoretical physicist,

24:49.613 --> 24:51.604
so she has a way
of bridging that divide.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.320
And as
a church-going scientist,
I appreciate that.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.072
Do you believe
in miracles?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.197
I have to.

24:58.288 --> 25:01.780
And, what if
they're just being used
to get people in the pews?

25:03.210 --> 25:05.041
The Reverend's
only concern
is helping others.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.244
You sure about that?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.999
She helped me.

25:08.090 --> 25:12.254
When my husband,
Daniel, passed away,
I wanted to join him.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.548
And the Reverend showed me
that where there's faith,

25:15.639 --> 25:17.015
there's hope.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.339
She saved my life.

25:21.937 --> 25:22.972
Okay.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.057
(BEEPING)

25:29.069 --> 25:30.445
(SIGHS)

25:47.546 --> 25:49.377
It must be pretty bad.

25:49.465 --> 25:53.378
I'm running through
every variation
of the neurotoxin antiserum.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.546
I will find a solution.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.219
Except I probably
won't be around for it.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.138
Let's discuss
worst-case scenarios.
Not yet.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.391
I have to.
For Kevin's sake.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.559
Nathan, if something
happens to me

26:11.612 --> 26:13.227
I need you to
take care of him.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.029
You know I would.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.066
And I want you
to tell the DOD.
what's happening.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.574
No. Well, not yet.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.737
In one more hour,
I'll know ifthis
last trial worked.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.830
What if I don't
make it through this?

26:26.085 --> 26:29.327
You will. You have to.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.881
I love you.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.798
I won't let you die.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.932
I won't allow it.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.687
We're getting reports
all over town.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.269
I promise he'll get to you
as soon as he can.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.153
You should really
wear your hair
down more often.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.695
Zane.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.319
Really not a good time.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.995
Yeah. No,
I got that impression
when you took off.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.040
Look. Forget it.
It's nothing.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.497
I think it is,
so either tell me
why you're pissed at me,

27:11.588 --> 27:13.874
or I'll hold my breath
until you do.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.459
What are you? Three?

27:15.551 --> 27:17.087
Hey, I black out,
it's on you.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.842
UNHAUNG)

27:23.976 --> 27:25.216
(SIGHING) Okay.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.473
You didn't do anything.
It's me.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.229
It's this whole town.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.476
(GASPING)

27:33.068 --> 27:34.933
Is this about the whole
miracles thing?

27:34.987 --> 27:37.023
Because seriously,
there's no such thing.

27:37.114 --> 27:40.447
Right. Because only dumb
people believe in something
beyond tachyons

27:40.492 --> 27:41.902
and particle accelerators.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.655
HENRY: Hold on.

27:43.871 --> 27:44.986
Maybe you should
think this through

27:45.038 --> 27:46.869
before you start
making accusations.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.288
Accusations against who?

27:48.333 --> 27:50.324
I tried to call you,
but my radio's out.

27:50.419 --> 27:53.502
I think that Reverend Harper
might be responsible
for what's been happening.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.754
You're both going to hell.
No. Look.
Look, look, look.

27:55.841 --> 27:59.049
We got an empty church
and a series
of alleged miracles.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.385
So I don't think it's crazy
to ask who stands to benefit.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.847
God.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.846
Carter, you're way
off base this time.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.013
I hope so.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.597
But before Reverend Harper
took up theology,
she used to be a physicist.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.015
You still think
I'm going to hell?
Probably.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.352
I think you're jumping
to conclusions.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.642
Okay. Bottom line.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.027
If Reverend Harper
is responsible,
we're in for a lot more.

28:19.072 --> 28:23.566
Yeah, like a plague
of locusts, or fiery hail.
Or total darkness.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.529
(SIGHING)

28:29.041 --> 28:30.906
You had to say it.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.061
Welcome to the end
of the world, Sheriff.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.234
Not if I can
help it. Thanks.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.989
Ah, hi, Reverend.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.692
Sheriff. Welcome.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.080
We need
to talk to you
for a second.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.621
Actually, he wants
to talk to you.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.120
Thanks for
the support.
You're welcome.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.246
What is it?

29:15.295 --> 29:19.709
Well, obviously
a lot of strange things
have been happening.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.670
One might say
religious things.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.092
Some might. Not me.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.423
Or me.
Trying to work
here, guys.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.506
What's your point, Sheriff?

29:28.600 --> 29:31.512
I was wondering,
and forgive this,

29:32.562 --> 29:36.100
who would stand
to gain the most

29:36.191 --> 29:39.683
by the sudden appearance
of apocalyptic-type signs?

29:40.821 --> 29:42.561
All of us,
I would think.

29:44.241 --> 29:48.484
Or maybe someone
who's been preaching to an
empty church every Sunday.

29:51.248 --> 29:52.863
You do have a point.

29:52.958 --> 29:53.993
Really?

29:54.084 --> 29:57.997
Sure.
But whatever's happening,
divine or not,

29:58.839 --> 30:00.420
I had nothing
to do with it.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.457
And as much as I would
love to believe that,

30:03.510 --> 30:06.877
you had the motive
and the knowledge
to pull it off.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.255
We know about
your background in physics.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.766
Theoretical physics, yes.
But there's a reason
why I left research

30:12.811 --> 30:17.646
for the clergy, Sheriff.
I wasn't much of a scientist.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.598
But I am a very
good preacher.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.564
Well, we're still going
to have to ask you in
for questioning.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.608
WOMAN: No. Oh no,
I don't think so.
MAN 1: I don't think so.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.986
MAN 2: Wait. Wait.

30:29.828 --> 30:34.822
Okay, okay.
Just relax. Well, crap.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.706
(HIGH-PITCHED ELECTRONIC TONE)

30:36.793 --> 30:38.499
What is that?

30:42.674 --> 30:45.006
How do you have music
during a blackout?

30:47.179 --> 30:50.012
It's a crystal radio system
powered by piezoelectricity.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.846
CARTER: Crystal radios.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.392
Henry, could radios
be responsible
for what's been happening?

30:59.483 --> 31:02.816
Radio waves, at the exact,
right frequency, yes.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.526
They might have caused
the interference.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.027
Can we test for that?

31:06.114 --> 31:08.730
Reverend?
We're going to have to
borrow that receiver.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.745
JO: Ifthis is happening
all over town, how come
we haven't heard it sooner?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.613
HENRY: Well, let's see.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.999
Sound waves can carry
infrasonic frequencies

31:20.045 --> 31:23.333
that occur
outside the range
of human hearing.

31:23.673 --> 31:27.712
And this crystalline glass
is the same as we found
in all three places.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.641
(HIGH-PITCHED ELECTRONIC TONE)

32:04.631 --> 32:07.543
Huh. And Seth's aquarium
was made out of
the same stuff?

32:07.634 --> 32:10.296
Yes.
Microorganisms in the water
were sonically agitated,

32:10.387 --> 32:11.797
creating a red tide effect.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.344
Okay, but what
about Zoe?

32:13.432 --> 32:17.300
Human tissues have
the capacity to transduce
pressure from sound waves.

32:17.394 --> 32:20.136
Infrasonic frequencies
might be putting pressure
on her vocal chords.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.515
So, Allison...

32:21.606 --> 32:23.107
Sonoluminescence.

32:23.150 --> 32:26.768
Sound waves
reacting with water,
causing objects to glow.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.526
So, who could
pull this off?

32:28.613 --> 32:31.446
Anyone with a background
in acoustics
and infrasonic research.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.651
I'm gonna
make a list.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.951
Diane Lancaster
is the head of acoustic
engineering here at G.D.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.910
I just spoke to her.
She's the music director
at the church.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.683
Here are
the latest test results
on Allison Blake, Doctor.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.072
I'm sorry, Dr. Stark.

33:14.159 --> 33:17.242
All right, what do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do?

33:19.664 --> 33:20.949
NURSE: You've done
all you can.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.286
(SIGHING)

33:25.045 --> 33:26.034
No.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.276
JO: Are those fireflies?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.278
HENRY: Bioluminescent
fireflies.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.485
This must be the place.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.989
Her husband died
a few months ago.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.576
She's been working
at home ever since.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.786
Working on what?

34:12.467 --> 34:14.458
(HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING)

34:24.229 --> 34:25.514
And that would be?

34:25.564 --> 34:26.804
A temporal rift.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.980
Or a portal to Heaven.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.275
Diane?

34:32.362 --> 34:33.898
No. Don't you
come any closer.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.484
Okay. Okay.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.195
She wants to cross over.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.325
Into what?

34:41.413 --> 34:42.994
Eternity.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.619
CARTER: Diane?
What you're thinking about
seems pretty permanent.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.246
You want to talk
about it for a second?

34:48.295 --> 34:51.162
There's nothing
to talk about.
You don't understand.

34:51.673 --> 34:53.914
I've found where
everything meets.

34:54.175 --> 34:57.463
The place where different
points in dimensional
space-time converge.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.424
Where Daniel
is waiting for me.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.215
Okay, let's
stick a pin in that.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.849
Okay. That can't
be Heaven.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.096
Why not?

35:06.396 --> 35:09.809
I mean, if she's really
discovered a gateway
to the multiverse.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.232
Not helping.
DIANE: I have faith
that it is.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.734
Revelations 4:1.

35:15.280 --> 35:20.400
"After this, I looked.
And behold, a door
was opened in Heaven."

35:21.244 --> 35:23.621
You understand.
Don't you, Henry?

35:36.384 --> 35:37.464
Mom?

35:39.846 --> 35:43.009
Your mom's sick, Kev.
And I can't help her.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.805
But you're special, Kevin.
Maybe you can.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.672
Mmm...

36:18.218 --> 36:20.129
(WHISPERING) Kevin...

36:27.644 --> 36:31.011
Diane? Do you realize
what you're about to do?

36:33.525 --> 36:36.107
I'm going to see
my husband again.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.277
He's gone, Diane.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.607
And we need you here.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.701
Now, there are
a lot of people
suffering out there

36:47.747 --> 36:49.283
because of your machine.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.706
And your knowledge
might be able
to save them.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.703
Are you going
to walk away
from that?

36:58.508 --> 36:59.588
You're just going
to let them die?

36:59.676 --> 37:01.041
No!

37:02.971 --> 37:04.711
Is that what Daniel
would want?

37:07.392 --> 37:10.259
I didn't mean to cause
all these problems.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.139
I just want to be
with him again.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.183
And you will.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.359
CARTER: You just have
to have a little faith.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.060
Henry?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.269
Jack, what if...

38:00.653 --> 38:02.689
What if this
really is what
she thinks it is?

38:02.989 --> 38:05.196
I mean,
Kim could be...

38:05.784 --> 38:07.149
We have to turn it off.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.628
I'm turning it off.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.652
(GASPING)

38:45.824 --> 38:47.234
Dad?

38:48.910 --> 38:50.400
Oh, thank God.

39:02.257 --> 39:05.670
(mm—amyace

39:05.718 --> 39:10.633
How sweet the sound

39:10.723 --> 39:16.844
That saved a wretch like me

39:20.733 --> 39:25.944
I once was lost

39:25.947 --> 39:26.982
I once was lost

39:27.031 --> 39:32.276
But now am found

39:32.620 --> 39:37.831
Was blind but now I see

39:37.834 --> 39:39.199
Was blind but now I see

39:47.552 --> 39:53.013
Jo? Are you really
gonna make me beg?

39:59.731 --> 40:01.687
You're here.
Yeah, well,

40:01.941 --> 40:04.808
I had to see if you
were lying about all
the babes who go to church.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.562
And you definitely were not.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.193
So, how are you?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.702
I'm miserable.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.412
But I'm here.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.073
Have faith.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.414
We'll see them again.
I promise.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.129
I know we will, Henry.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.799
It means a lot to me
that you came, Nathan.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.251
Anything for you.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.716
You saved my life.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.596
It wasn't me.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.258
And it wasn't shutting down
Diane's machine, either.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.385
What do you mean?

40:47.487 --> 40:48.818
Kevin?

40:48.905 --> 40:50.816
He controls
the field now, Allie.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.952
He's evolving.

41:07.757 --> 41:11.966
Reverend? For the record,
I'm really glad
that I was wrong.

41:12.345 --> 41:14.336
So we'll see you
next Sunday then?

41:15.682 --> 41:19.140
It's a tough one.
The Dodgers are playing
the Mets, so...

41:19.978 --> 41:21.969
Have a slice of
pepperoni for me.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.557
That I can do.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.098
Thanks. See you.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.148
Uh, hang on
for a second.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.532
CARTER: Excuse me.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.400
Shenﬁ.
Hi, Henry.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.657
I borrowed
this book from you.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.408
Just wanted
to return it.

41:41.499 --> 41:44.241
Huh. I don't
remember that.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.950
But I hope you
enjoyed it.

41:46.212 --> 41:48.828
Yeah. It really
opened my eyes.

41:48.923 --> 41:51.665
As all good books
should do.

41:53.302 --> 41:54.917
Yeah. Henry?
Yeah?

41:55.430 --> 41:57.466
You're my best friend,
you know.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.973
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.439
Is it a sin
that my favorite part
was the music?

42:12.530 --> 42:14.896
Well, you stayed awake, right?

42:14.991 --> 42:16.197
You hear that guy
snoring behind us?

42:16.242 --> 42:17.857
Like a chainsaw.
Yeah.

42:18.286 --> 42:21.449
So, Dad. You know
my rose tattoo?

42:22.874 --> 42:24.410
It's fake.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.161
It was fake?

42:26.210 --> 42:29.702
Yes. But since you
seemed okay with it,

42:30.923 --> 42:32.754
I can get a
real one now, right?

42:34.469 --> 42:36.209
Yeah.
Really?

42:37.055 --> 42:38.920
Absolutely.
Really?

42:39.015 --> 42:40.801
Well, when hell
freezes over.
