Hitchcock fell asleep in the break room,

00:11.008 --> 00:12.741
so I put his hand in a
bowl of warm water.

00:12.777 --> 00:14.610
Come on, man.
That's the stupidest prank ever.

00:14.645 --> 00:17.813
Uh, no, it's the smartest
because it involves biology.

00:17.848 --> 00:19.748
I bet it worked already. Let's go check.

- He's drowning, he's drowning!

Phew, talk about "can't miss."

01:00.391 --> 01:02.024
Yeah, we don't really go for the talks.

01:02.059 --> 01:05.194

it's famed thermometer museum.

Last year, I got to try out a heat ray.

01:26.573 --> 01:29.752
Three, the Buffalo P.D. always
throws an insane party.

01:29.787 --> 01:31.019
Last year, Amy got so drunk,

01:31.055 --> 01:32.621
she jumped a police horse into the pool.

01:32.656 --> 01:34.523
Eight-drink Amy is an equestrian,

01:34.558 --> 01:36.191

01:36.227 --> 01:37.726
This isn't an excuse for you to party.

not the Newport Folk Festival.

Come on, sir. It's been a hard year.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.153

a party to blow off some steam.

01:45.179 --> 01:46.401
<i>First we were on the night shift,</i>

01:46.437 --> 01:48.370
then the precinct almost got shut down.

01:48.405 --> 01:49.772
I got hit by a bus.

01:49.807 --> 01:51.206
Well, we have been through a lot,

01:51.242 --> 01:54.588
but, frankly,
our reputation has taken a hit.

01:54.645 --> 01:57.246

- Meet to please you, Shatz.
- Your hands are so clammy.

and they still smell.

- No, it was.

a breastfeeding mother.

- I hope not.
- [chuckles]

05:36.800 --> 05:38.673
You're being a little harsh
on him, Captain.

05:38.699 --> 05:41.470
I've been up for promotions
against that man on six occasions,

05:41.505 --> 05:43.138
and he's prevailed every single time.

05:43.173 --> 05:45.522
Why? Because he's a snake.

05:45.548 --> 05:47.776
Isn't it possible he gets promotions

05:47.811 --> 05:50.445

Please, I hate to say this about anyone,

05:52.616 --> 05:54.149

This is a nightmare.

Okay, I talked to some of the
vendors at the tech expo,

07:00.169 --> 07:01.755

us up for the party.

Holt didn't want us going to a party,

07:15.100 --> 07:16.600
he certainly doesn't
want us throwing one.

07:16.635 --> 07:17.734

[sighs, exhales] I'm good.

15:58.923 --> 16:00.089
- [gags]
- Oh, hey, hey!

16:00.124 --> 16:01.881
Oh, Scully.

16:01.993 --> 16:03.225
You bummed about Cindy

16:03.261 --> 16:05.528
or you just feel at home in a body bag?

16:05.563 --> 16:07.029
We use the same medicated powder.

16:07.064 --> 16:08.388
I could smell it.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.567
- She's my soul mate, Amy.
- So she doesn't like you.

16:11.602 --> 16:13.669
It happens. I mean, not to me,

16:13.704 --> 16:16.205
but not everyone has my combination

16:16.240 --> 16:19.508
of elegance and charm
and grace and poise,

16:19.544 --> 16:22.077
and then just gif-ability.
Some would say "jif,"

16:22.113 --> 16:23.879
but then some would also say "syrup."

16:23.915 --> 16:26.549
Wait, what if we could give
Scully our personalities?

16:26.584 --> 16:28.484
[gasps] He would love that.

16:28.519 --> 16:29.985
We could talk to him through an earpiece

16:30.021 --> 16:31.786
- and tell him what to say.
- Okay,

16:32.256 --> 16:33.956
but can we attach a string to it?

16:33.991 --> 16:36.041
Last time I wore an earpiece,
it fell in.

16:36.327 --> 16:37.960
<i>- How you doing, Scully?</i>
- Nervous.

16:37.995 --> 16:40.095
I can feel my legs. That never happens.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.031
- Something's wrong.
- Okay, just go up to her

16:42.066 --> 16:43.332
and repeat what we say.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.034
- [quietly] I wasn't gonna...
- Hi, there.

16:45.069 --> 16:46.602
Scully, hey.

16:46.866 --> 16:49.271
Both: Cindy, there's something
I want to say to you.

16:49.307 --> 16:50.773
The moment I first saw you...

16:50.808 --> 16:52.007
You took my breath away.

16:52.043 --> 16:53.809
Both: Whenever I'm around you...

16:53.845 --> 16:55.177
My heart beats faster.

16:55.213 --> 16:56.712
I know you're going home today...

16:56.747 --> 16:58.814
Both: But I couldn't let you
leave without asking you out.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.349
- Cindy Shatz...
- Cindy Shatz...

17:00.384 --> 17:02.391
<i>- Can I buy you a drink?</i>
- Can I buy you a drink?

17:03.169 --> 17:04.569
[indistinct chatter]

17:04.627 --> 17:05.992
No, I'm sorry.

17:06.123 --> 17:07.957
I'm not interested.

17:08.307 --> 17:10.364
- What?
- No.

17:10.390 --> 17:12.690
Guys, earpiece fell in.

17:12.797 --> 17:14.329
What on earth took you so long?

17:14.365 --> 17:15.931
Yeah, where the frigging hell were you?

17:15.967 --> 17:17.398
I was trying to get the colors right,

17:17.435 --> 17:18.834
but in the end,

17:18.869 --> 17:21.337
I decided to just go with
your original black and white.

17:21.372 --> 17:23.271
It's probably even one color too many.

17:23.340 --> 17:25.954
Anyways, in you go. [sighs]

17:26.484 --> 17:27.742
Looking good, Diaz.

17:27.778 --> 17:29.211
- Bite me.
- Okay.

17:29.247 --> 17:30.946
Uh, hello, I'm Captain Raymond Holt,

17:30.982 --> 17:32.848
and if I have the pleasure
of joining your board,

17:32.884 --> 17:34.350
here are some of the
things that I would do.

17:34.385 --> 17:35.818
See? It all worked out.

17:35.853 --> 17:38.754
We threw a wild party with
absolutely zero consequences.

17:38.789 --> 17:40.447
- [audience murmuring]
- Jake, something's wrong.

17:40.858 --> 17:42.540
Oh, um...

17:42.789 --> 17:45.661
oh, I don't know how that
got in there or what it is.

17:45.696 --> 17:47.850
Um, I'll just, uh... next slide.
[projector clicks]

17:48.065 --> 17:50.466
Well, that's strange. Next slide.

17:50.501 --> 17:51.975
Next. Next.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.703
Oh, I see what's happening here.

17:54.739 --> 17:57.206
Uh, due to an issue
with the Internet cloud,

17:57.241 --> 17:58.774
you are seeing a series of pictures

17:58.809 --> 18:00.809
that have nothing to do with me

18:00.845 --> 18:02.811
or the 99th precinct.

18:02.847 --> 18:05.114
I don't get it. Who even
took these pictures?

18:05.149 --> 18:06.415
I did.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.584
You guys should really be
a lot more careful

18:08.619 --> 18:10.552
about leaving laptops lying around.

18:10.588 --> 18:11.720
[camera clicks]

18:11.756 --> 18:13.923
For next year. [chuckles]

18:14.777 --> 18:16.419
Consequences.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.399
My, oh, my. Boyle, can you even tell me

18:20.425 --> 18:21.825
what is happening in this picture?

18:21.851 --> 18:24.218
Uh, that's me doing a
Jean-Claude Van Damme split

18:24.253 --> 18:25.651
between two beds.

18:25.677 --> 18:27.418
I had to wear my underwear
for flexibility.

18:27.444 --> 18:29.917
Mm-hmm, and, uh, Santiago?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.543
I believe that is me throwing up

18:31.569 --> 18:33.636
- into a pillow case.
- Uh-oh.

18:33.662 --> 18:35.229
You have all embarrassed the precinct.

18:35.264 --> 18:38.135
Now when people think of the Nine-Nine,
they'll think of, um...

18:38.501 --> 18:41.991
oh, Detective Diaz filling
an iron with tequila.

18:42.017 --> 18:43.279
So I could make tequila steam.

18:43.305 --> 18:44.972
I can quite believe I'm gonna say this,

18:45.007 --> 18:47.247
but I'm sorry I even came to Rochester.

18:49.912 --> 18:51.712
- [door opens and closes]
- [whimpers]

18:51.747 --> 18:54.114
Hey, it's all right, Scully. We'll
find a way to make it up to him.

18:54.150 --> 18:55.784
Ah, it's not about him, Jake.

18:55.810 --> 18:59.078
I'm just sad because I'm an
unlovable sack of fungus,

18:59.104 --> 19:00.570
and I'm gonna be alone forever.

19:00.596 --> 19:02.201
Oh, um...

19:02.625 --> 19:04.625
Hey, there's probably
someone out there for...

19:04.660 --> 19:06.026
- We got this.
- Oh, thank God.

19:06.061 --> 19:09.229
Wow, pint of milk on the rocks.

19:09.265 --> 19:11.330
- Real Scully move.
- Can I help you?

19:11.356 --> 19:12.909
Hi, we're friends of Scully's,

19:12.935 --> 19:15.169
and we're not sure why you rejected him?

19:15.204 --> 19:17.104
Now, we know Scully's not perfect,

19:17.139 --> 19:19.339
his hands smell like clams, and, yeah,

19:19.375 --> 19:21.875
over 75% of his body has died, and...

19:21.911 --> 19:23.610
Gina, you can stop listing things.

19:23.646 --> 19:25.746
Point is, he's a good guy.

19:25.781 --> 19:26.980
You should give him a chance.

19:27.016 --> 19:29.910
I know, when I first meet him,
I was intrigued,

19:30.002 --> 19:31.893
but then Mr. Confident showed up,

19:32.421 --> 19:33.620
I'm not interested in that.

19:33.656 --> 19:36.123
Confident people are mean and selfish.

19:36.158 --> 19:39.193
Wait, you liked awkward Scully?

19:39.228 --> 19:40.427
Giraffe-heart Scully?

19:40.463 --> 19:42.564
Oh, my God, he has a giraffe heart?

19:42.832 --> 19:45.299
Aww, I bet it pushes on his organs.

19:45.334 --> 19:46.430
[laughs awkwardly]

19:47.470 --> 19:49.706
We'll be back in five minutes.
Wait right here.

19:49.732 --> 19:51.371
Bartender, can you top off her milk?

19:51.407 --> 19:53.140
<i>[playful music]</i>

19:53.175 --> 19:54.808
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:54.844 --> 19:56.410
- You wanna hear a joke?
- Okay.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.145
I don't know any jokes. I should go.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.828
Oh, that's okay. I don't
know any jokes either.

20:01.904 --> 20:03.884
I slept in a body bag last night.

20:03.919 --> 20:06.086
[exhales]

20:07.790 --> 20:10.626
- Whoa.
- They're so cute.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.184
Oh, no, Scully, don't put
your finger in her mouth.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.407
Oh, she likes it.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.135
Captain, I'm sorry that
things got out of hand,

20:22.171 --> 20:24.171
but you can still be on the board.

20:24.206 --> 20:26.573
I read 85 pages of the
convention bylaws,

20:26.609 --> 20:28.208
- and...
- That was unnecessary.

20:28.244 --> 20:30.344
- I don't wanna be on the board.
- But I read bylaws.

20:30.379 --> 20:31.512
I wanna show you a
picture from last night

20:31.547 --> 20:32.813
- that really upset me.
- Okay,

20:32.848 --> 20:34.615
but in my defense, Rosa bet me 50 cents

20:34.650 --> 20:35.916
that I couldn't drink all that shampoo.

20:35.951 --> 20:38.051
That's not what I wanted to...
You drank shampoo?

20:38.087 --> 20:39.419
What? No.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.826
You're the one farting bubbles.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.540
This is what I wanted to show you.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.291
Do you know what disappoints me most

20:44.326 --> 20:46.593
about this about this picture?
That I'm not in it.

20:46.629 --> 20:48.262
I can't remember the last time

20:48.297 --> 20:49.840
I saw the Nine-Nine so happy,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.733
- and I wasn't there.
- 'Cause you were working

20:52.768 --> 20:54.067
on your presentation to get us a win.

20:54.103 --> 20:56.112
Yeah, well, it wasn't a real win.

20:56.605 --> 20:59.080
- I wish I had been in that photo.
- I know,

20:59.308 --> 21:01.648
and I'm sorry you didn't
have more fun this weekend.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.808
But it's not over,

21:04.346 --> 21:06.285
and we are still in Rochester.

21:06.615 --> 21:07.950
What are you saying?

21:07.976 --> 21:09.616
I think you know what I'm saying.

21:09.652 --> 21:11.418
What a thermometer.

21:11.453 --> 21:14.488
Look at the mercury reservoir
on that mamacita.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.891
Oh, Peralta, this is amazing.
I'm floating on air.

21:17.927 --> 21:19.692
Hey, everybody, get in for a picture.

21:20.095 --> 21:21.895
Excuse me, sir.
Can you take a picture of us?

21:21.931 --> 21:23.130
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

21:23.165 --> 21:25.933
Everybody say Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.

21:25.968 --> 21:28.323
[together] Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.
