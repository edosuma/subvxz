01:46.539 --> 01:48.541
While you were sleeping
we found out

01:48.541 --> 01:50.043
hunter scangarelo
got into reed college.

01:50.543 --> 01:51.044
Sayonara.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.046
Can't you be
happy for hunter?

01:53.046 --> 01:54.547
Reed was
her first choice.

01:54.547 --> 01:56.549
She'd die
if she didn't get in.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.551
Why do you always
think everything has
something to do with me?

01:59.052 --> 02:00.553
Because you didn't
get in anywhere.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.555
Anthony, nobody is hearing
anything for months.

02:02.555 --> 02:05.558
Hunter took early acceptance,
so she found out early.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.560
But that meant she could
only apply to one college.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.064
Your sister, on the other hand
gave herself a lot of options,

02:11.064 --> 02:14.567
such as bowdoin,
holy cross, georgetown.

02:14.567 --> 02:17.570
You know that georgetown
is a total reach for me.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.572
They'd be crazy
not to want you.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.075
If i can get in there
that means i can
probably get into berkeley.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.077
Over my dead body.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.079
There are more
nobel prize winners in
the san francisco bay area

02:26.079 --> 02:27.580
than anywhere
on the planet.

02:27.580 --> 02:31.584
Nobel prize for what,
packing fudge?

02:31.584 --> 02:35.588
Look, you know you can
go anywhere you want
to go to college.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.591
But i'll tell you where
i'm not gonna pay for,
and that's berkeley.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.593
I want to go to harvard
or west point.

02:40.593 --> 02:43.596
You may see them on television,
but that's about it.

02:43.596 --> 02:47.600
You want to go to
a college like that,
you gotta crack the books.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.614
Stockings, chris.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.616
How many you think
you gotta sell

03:03.616 --> 03:05.618
to pay the nut
on this place?

03:06.119 --> 03:08.121
How can i express
how little i give a fuck?

03:09.622 --> 03:11.624
Shh, shh,
what's that?

03:11.624 --> 03:13.626
Fucking rent- a- jake.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.129
Want me to cave the rest
of your head in?

03:16.129 --> 03:18.131
That's bent enough.

03:18.131 --> 03:22.135
Get the crowbar,
pop the plate.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.637
Sean, without fail,
every time we're
on a fucking job.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.140
The adrenaline affects
everybody differently.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.143
Big pussy bompensiero,
he started out
as a cat burglar.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.145
One time he left
a load so big,

03:32.145 --> 03:34.147
cop thought a bear
was in the place.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.150
Pussy bompensiero started off
chipping safes like this?

03:37.650 --> 03:39.152
Until he stepped up
for johnny soprano

03:39.152 --> 03:41.154
during the unrest
of'83.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.656
Back then,
when you did something
you got recognized.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.159
Your time comes,
you either step up

03:46.159 --> 03:47.660
or start looking
for a new career.

03:47.660 --> 03:55.168
Selling stockings
door to door.

03:55.168 --> 03:59.172
The profile toner
is a wonderful, affordable

03:59.172 --> 04:04.677
easily- used alternative
to undergoing facelift surgery.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.680
The profile toner is great
for any age and any body type,

04:08.181 --> 04:09.682
even for those
hereditary...

04:09.682 --> 04:12.185
you've probably
given up on.

04:12.685 --> 04:13.686
Carm.

04:13.686 --> 04:19.192
Why don't you take
a xanex or something?

04:19.692 --> 04:21.694
What is this obsession
with berkeley?

04:21.694 --> 04:23.696
What, is she trying
to get away from us?

04:23.696 --> 04:25.698
Absolutely,
that's her job.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.700
Go ahead, laugh.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.702
What are you gonna do
if she gets into berkeley

04:29.702 --> 04:31.704
and not into notre dame
or georgetown?

04:32.205 --> 04:35.708
She's in the
national honor society,
for chrissake.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.211
Don't be naive,
tony, please.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.713
How do you think
hunter scangerelo
got into reed college?

04:40.713 --> 04:42.715
Her uncle,
that's how.

04:42.715 --> 04:44.717
Him and his wife
are graduates.

04:44.717 --> 04:48.721
That's the only way
that little freak
was gonna get into college.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.223
Second baby boom.

04:50.223 --> 04:53.226
Grades, great sat scores,
it's not enough anymore.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.728
It's all who you know
or how many buildings you give.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.730
So, what you want me
to do, huh?

05:17.250 --> 05:20.253
He here?

05:20.253 --> 05:21.754
Hey.

05:21.754 --> 05:26.759
Someone leave a cage open
at turtleback zoo?

05:26.759 --> 05:28.761
Sit down,
for chrissake.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.264
I want to talk to you
about beansie gaeta.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.765
He may never
walk again.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.267
Never say never.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.769
No...
say never.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.272
He's a shopping cart,
from here on out.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.275
He gets home from rehab soon,
poor motherfucker.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.776
You should
help him out.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.778
Help him out?

05:45.778 --> 05:48.281
You should build him
a ramp on his house
for the wheelchair.

05:48.281 --> 05:52.285
You know, make the place
handicap accessible.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.288
Maybe while i'm over there
i could fuck his wife.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.790
C'mon, rich, you're
a fucking captain now.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.793
And a salut',
so, exert a little pressure.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.796
Call that nephew of yours,
vito, and other one.

06:03.796 --> 06:06.299
They're in the building trades,
aren't they?

06:06.299 --> 06:08.301
Are you
fucking serious?

06:08.301 --> 06:10.303
Richie,
it's a gesture.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.305
The man has
a lot of friends.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.308
You're out of
your fucking minds.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.311
Don't take
that attitude.

06:18.311 --> 06:22.815
Richie, hey, you're gonna
build beansie a ramp.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.318
I'll build a ramp
up to your ass...

06:25.318 --> 06:29.322
drive a lionel
up in there.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.832
Jeannie, hi!

06:39.832 --> 06:41.834
You putting your roses
to bed, huh?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.336
Carmela, hi.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.838
I haven't seen you
at spinning class lately.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.341
I went by and
rang the bell a couple times,

06:48.341 --> 06:49.342
you weren'
t home either.

06:49.842 --> 06:50.843
Really?

06:50.843 --> 06:52.345
The other day,
i'm at the willowbrook mall

06:52.345 --> 06:53.846
and i see you going
on the down escalator,

06:54.347 --> 06:55.848
and i'm yelling,
"jeannie, jeannie."

06:55.848 --> 06:57.850
That's when i realized
it was your sister.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.353
Didn't she go
to georgetown?

07:00.353 --> 07:02.355
Georgetown law,
georgetown law review,

07:02.355 --> 07:06.859
regional secretary of
the georgetown alumni
association of short hills.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.362
Because my meadow
applied to georgetown.

07:09.362 --> 07:12.865
And i am hoping and prayin
g to jesus that she gets in.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.367
She keeps
talking about berkeley.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.369
Madonn', berkeley.

07:16.369 --> 07:20.373
College already, huh?
They get big so fast.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.875
Oh god,
is that the time?

07:22.875 --> 07:24.377
Uh, jeannie.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.879
I need to
ask you a favor.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.882
I was wondering if
you would ask your sister

07:29.882 --> 07:31.884
to write meadow
a letter of recommendation.

07:31.884 --> 07:32.885
Is that
too forward?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.388
Well, but she doesn't
really know meadow.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.389
But you do

07:36.889 --> 07:38.391
and you could give her
meadow's transcripts,

07:38.391 --> 07:40.393
which are excellent,
by the way.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.894
Her paper on
the melting icecap,

07:42.395 --> 07:43.896
it made me cry,
it was so poignant.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.898
It was published in
"the daily caduceus".

07:45.898 --> 07:47.400
My sister,
she's so busy.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.902
Really, if there is
any way

07:49.902 --> 07:55.908
you could find your wa
y to helping me out here.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.410
I'll ask her.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.912
Thank you, jeannie.

07:59.912 --> 08:05.918
I'll let you get back
to your plants.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.420
Good, good, good.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.921
That's it,
push up.

08:08.921 --> 08:13.926
Now bracing yourself
on the bedside hand.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.428
Richie.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.431
Could you excuse u
s for a moment, dear?

08:18.431 --> 08:19.432
No.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.434
Are you alright,
mr. Gaeta?

08:21.434 --> 08:22.935
He's fine.

08:22.935 --> 08:28.441
He's so proud, he won't accept
some friendly concern.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.943
Just stay right out
in the hall.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.450
What do you want?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.952
Why don't you fuckin' kill me,
you cocksucker?

08:40.453 --> 08:42.955
For chrissake,
look what you did to me.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.457
Whose idea
was the ramp?

08:44.457 --> 08:45.958
What ramp?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.460
The fucking ramp.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.463
If you need help,
i'll fuckin' help you.

08:50.463 --> 08:53.466
You understand?
You talk to me.

08:53.466 --> 08:57.470
I don't want jack shit
from you.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.972
Okay...
i'll leave.

09:00.473 --> 09:06.479
But if you go crying to
tony soprano one more time...

09:06.479 --> 09:09.482
if you
open your mouth,

09:09.482 --> 09:14.487
i'm gonna send your arms
where your legs are.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.003
Liz, let me in,
i gotta see adriana.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.004
She's not here.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.006
Let me in,
i gotta talk to her.

09:34.006 --> 09:37.510
You are not welcome
in this house.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.513
What the fuck, adriana,
i'm sorry, okay?

09:40.513 --> 09:42.014
How many times
i gotta call here?

09:42.014 --> 09:43.516
Just go away,
christopher!

09:43.516 --> 09:45.518
I hate you, i never want
to speak to you again!

09:45.518 --> 09:46.519
I'm callin
g the police.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.020
Don't be like that,
adriana.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.022
I love you, i'm going crazy,
i miss you.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.024
I'm dialing 911.

09:52.024 --> 09:53.025
Why should i
listen to you?

09:53.526 --> 09:55.027
So you can dump another
glass of wine in your soup

09:55.027 --> 09:57.029
and embarrass me in front of
a whole restaurant?

09:57.029 --> 09:58.030
Give me
the phone!

09:58.030 --> 09:59.532
Go in
the other room!

09:59.532 --> 10:01.534
Ow.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.035
I want
to marry you.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.537
What?

10:04.537 --> 10:06.539
I mean it, adriana,
i love you.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.040
I want to marry you.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.543
Got you a ring
and everything.

10:10.543 --> 10:11.544
Don't listen to him.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.546
He's been jerking you around
for three years.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.047
You're wasting
your whole youth.

10:15.047 --> 10:18.050
Ma.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.552
Open it.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.555
Sure, i bet it was in
zane's window this morning.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.057
I bet there's bits
of broken glass in it.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.559
Mom, would you
leave us alone?

10:26.559 --> 10:29.562
I hear you sobbing
in your bed at night!

10:29.562 --> 10:33.566
Ma!

10:33.566 --> 10:35.568
When you get hurt
next time,

10:35.568 --> 10:37.570
this door
is closed to you.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.581
Oh, my god.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.083
Christopher.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.085
It's three carats.

10:53.085 --> 10:57.089
The guy said
you can bring it in,
have it sized or whatever,

10:57.590 --> 10:59.592
if it's loose.

10:59.592 --> 11:03.596
Christopher!

11:04.096 --> 11:06.599
He had "the mummy"
before it was in the theaters.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.602
Oh...
look who's here.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.604
I was wondering why
the squirrels went quiet.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.607
This nephew of yours,
he a real ball breaker.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.610
I'm telling hi
m about the tapes.

11:17.610 --> 11:21.614
These are the real
hollywood quality
broadcast movies.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.116
None of that
timecoding bullshit,

11:24.116 --> 11:27.119
or blurry pictures those
nigerians sell on the street.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.621
You're in
on this.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.122
10, 000 units.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.124
What's johnny sack
say about that?

11:32.625 --> 11:38.130
Fuck new york.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.132
I better run before that
wife of yours gets home.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.135
Besides, i can't be seen
associating with known felons.

11:43.135 --> 11:46.138
What's your excuse
for hanging out
with this undesirable?

11:46.138 --> 11:47.640
The terms of
my house arrest

11:48.140 --> 11:52.645
allow me to
do my grocery shopping.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.648
Don't put handprints
on the finish!

11:55.648 --> 11:56.649
Oh.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.151
Last of the arugala rabe
from the garden.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.654
Don't drench it
in oil this time.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.657
He likes to mop with his bread,
it's not my fault.

12:04.657 --> 12:08.661
What brings you to an
english- speaking neighborhood?

12:08.661 --> 12:11.163
Fucking winghead
came to see me.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.165
Paulie.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.670
He said i got to
build a fucking ramp
on beansie's house.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.672
Yeah, i know.

12:20.172 --> 12:23.676
Wait, this was
your idea?

12:23.676 --> 12:27.179
Jesus christ, tony, is this
how you spend your time?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.683
Beansie gaeta would still be
selling nickel bags
on jefferson avenue

12:30.683 --> 12:33.185
if it wasn't
for jackie.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.187
Richie, build beansie
the ramp.

12:35.187 --> 12:41.694
Terrible accident
that kid had.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.196
Yeah,
it's done.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.698
C'mon,
come here.

12:46.198 --> 12:49.201
I got something
for you.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.210
What's this?

12:58.210 --> 13:00.713
"What's this"?
It's the jacket.

13:01.213 --> 13:02.214
The jacket.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.717
The jacket
i took off rocco dimeo.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.719
Oh, yeah,
yeah.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.222
Cocksucker had
the toughest reputation
in essex county.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.725
But he never came back
after i got through with him.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.226
He later died
of alzheimers.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.728
Yeah?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.229
Try it on.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.231
It's your
fucking jacket.

13:19.231 --> 13:20.733
You loved
this jacket.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.235
You and my kid brother,
you would've killed
for this jacket.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.738
Silk lining,
fine corinthian leather.

13:26.238 --> 13:29.742
Nobody believed with my size
i could carry this jacket.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.744
But with the belt
it was like rocco.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.747
It's a nice jacket.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.249
It's a beautiful
jacket.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.252
But it's yours
to have now.

13:40.252 --> 13:40.753
Why?

13:41.253 --> 13:42.755
I gotta let go
of the past.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.256
Like the tao says,

13:44.757 --> 13:48.260
"you got to shut one door
before another one can open."

13:48.260 --> 13:50.763
Is that
so hard to do?

13:50.763 --> 13:57.269
You did it.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.271
That's it,
that's it.

13:59.772 --> 14:00.773
Oh!

14:00.773 --> 14:02.775
Huh?

14:02.775 --> 14:04.276
Perfect.

14:04.276 --> 14:07.279
You look like robert evans
over here.

14:15.788 --> 14:16.789
Thanks.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.841
Is that all
tony said?

15:08.841 --> 15:10.843
Did he say
anything else?

15:10.843 --> 15:12.845
What the fuck do you
want him to do?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.346
Give you a kiss
on the lips?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.348
He said,"nice wagon,
where's his end?"

15:16.348 --> 15:18.851
To kick upstairs
to tony soprano
would be an honor.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.352
He the man.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.354
I thought you said
i was the man.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.356
He the man, i the man,
who the man?

15:24.356 --> 15:26.859
"Are vee not men?"

15:32.364 --> 15:33.866
Listen,

15:33.866 --> 15:36.869
tony's cut from
this thing and that one,

15:37.369 --> 15:38.871
that comes out of
your end, not mine.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.373
That's how it is
in the beginning.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.876
The dues concept,
we're down with that.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.378
I laid out my whole take
on the diamond for ade anyway.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.380
Adriana la cerva,

15:48.380 --> 15:50.382
there's one hotty.

15:50.382 --> 15:52.885
She loves me and these are
her child- bearing years.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.387
I don't see myself
getting married though.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.889
I get all
the'ho cake i need

15:57.389 --> 15:59.892
and i can hire somebody
to wash my dishes
and iron my shirts.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.894
Yeah, i could
see that.

16:02.895 --> 16:06.398
No more burritos, or
you're not working with me.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.901
Look at this
fucking place.

16:08.901 --> 16:13.405
You imagine spending
day after day in here,
year after year?

16:49.942 --> 16:51.443
Can i help you?

16:51.443 --> 16:52.444
Miss gaeta?

16:52.444 --> 16:53.946
We're here
to put in the ramp.

16:53.946 --> 16:54.947
What ramp?

16:54.947 --> 16:56.448
For your husband.

16:56.448 --> 16:57.950
You're from rehab outreach
at st. Erasmus?

16:58.450 --> 17:00.953
We're also supposed to
alter the toilets

17:00.953 --> 17:04.455
and widen the doorways
and so on,

17:04.455 --> 17:06.458
to make the house more
wheelchair accessible.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.460
Who sent you
over here?

17:08.460 --> 17:10.462
Richie aprile.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.464
Richie aprile?

17:13.464 --> 17:16.468
We should be done
by the time beansie's
home from the hospital.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.970
Get out of here.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.471
I don't want anything
to do with that man

17:19.471 --> 17:23.474
after what
he did to peter.

17:23.474 --> 17:25.477
She's got
her problems,

17:25.477 --> 17:30.983
but i'm not gonna tell richie
this is not getting done.

17:40.492 --> 17:41.994
Richie.

17:41.994 --> 17:42.995
Donny!

17:42.995 --> 17:47.499
This is matthew bevelaqua
and sean gismonte.

17:47.499 --> 17:49.001
They're both
from west orange.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.502
I'm back
to drinkwater.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.504
It's fucking good
to meet you, richie.

17:52.504 --> 17:54.006
My cousin louis gismonte
worked with you

17:54.506 --> 17:56.008
in the prison sign shop
at east jersey.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.009
Oh, yeah, lou.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.011
About 5'8",
about 225.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.014
I'm taking them over
to my uncle joey's lot
to look at iroc's.

18:02.014 --> 18:05.017
They asked if they can
come by and say hello first.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.518
You've been doing some things
with christopher molitsanti.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.020
You know,
this and that.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.022
The attitude on
that camel- nose fuck.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.024
He ever lays his hand
on my niece again

18:12.024 --> 18:14.526
i'm gonna tear him apart
piece by piece.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.028
Camel nose!

18:16.528 --> 18:17.529
You can't
make that shit up.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.031
What the fuck are
you talking about?

18:19.531 --> 18:20.532
I just did.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.034
Did you ever notice
he's the only motherfucker

18:22.534 --> 18:24.036
who can smoke
a cigarette in the rain

18:24.036 --> 18:26.038
with his hands
tied behind his back?

18:26.038 --> 18:31.043
That nose is like
a natural canopy.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.045
The kid has
his good points.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.547
I'm not saying
anything against him,
he's my homey.

18:35.547 --> 18:37.049
Your what?

18:37.049 --> 18:38.550
He lives up
near me.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.052
Why didn't
you say that?

18:40.052 --> 18:42.554
If you want to talk
like a fucking moulinyan,

18:42.554 --> 18:45.057
we'll send you to
slip- and- fall school.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.559
Fellas, c'mon,
time's up, let's go.

18:47.559 --> 18:49.061
Richie, it was
good meeting you.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.563
If there's ever anything
you can do for me

18:51.563 --> 18:53.565
let me know.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.573
Hi.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.075
Oh, my god,
did we have a lunch?

19:03.575 --> 19:05.077
I'm rushing out the door
to a deposition.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.578
I was in
the neighborhood.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.080
Downtown newark?

19:08.080 --> 19:10.082
I think i goofed,
joannie.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.584
I don't know how i got
into this conversation.

19:12.584 --> 19:15.087
But carmela soprano,
from next door,

19:15.087 --> 19:17.589
trapped me and asked me
if i'd ask you

19:18.090 --> 19:20.592
to write her daughter
a letter of recommendation
to georgetown.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.594
The gangster's wife?

19:22.594 --> 19:23.595
I'm sorry.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.598
She just blind- sided me
in the backyard.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.100
What was i
supposed to say?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.102
That i'm busy?
Which i am.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.104
That i don't even
know the girl?

19:32.104 --> 19:35.607
C'mon, you met meadow,
4th of july, at our barbecue.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.109
That's not
what i mean.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.111
You can't expect me
to do this.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.612
It's just
a letter.

19:40.612 --> 19:43.615
Bruce just wrote one
to u. V. M.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.617
You do it
all the time.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.620
Bring gangsters onto
the georgetown campus?

19:48.620 --> 19:50.622
I don't think so.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.624
Oh, spare me
the elitist bullshit.

19:52.624 --> 19:53.625
They're
my neighbors.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.127
Have you
lost your mind?

19:55.627 --> 19:57.129
Carmela
asked me, joan.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.630
What, are you
frightened?

19:58.630 --> 20:00.132
What do you think
they're gonna do,

20:00.132 --> 20:02.634
put you in cement boots
over a college application?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.636
It's not that,
it's a question of manners.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.138
What am i
supposed to say?

20:06.138 --> 20:08.640
That i'm writing a letter
for someone else, which i am.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.643
A wonderful young dominican boy
from the projects

20:11.643 --> 20:13.145
with a 5. 2 average.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.147
I have a reputation
to protect.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.150
I knew
you wouldn't do it.

20:18.650 --> 20:21.153
You want to be a doormat
for the rest of your life?

20:21.153 --> 20:27.159
Just deal with it,
jeannie, okay?

20:27.659 --> 20:29.661
It's no trouble at all
to add two more,

20:29.661 --> 20:32.164
especially with miss meadow
among the missing.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.165
Don't be silly.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.166
We just dropped by
to pick up

20:34.666 --> 20:36.168
some of ma's furniture
from the basement.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.170
"Ma" now?

20:38.170 --> 20:40.172
You, come over and sit
with me and anthony,

20:40.172 --> 20:42.174
and let janice's friend
sit at the foot.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.676
Grandpa, after dinner,
hot wheels?

20:44.676 --> 20:45.677
Ooh.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.180
Something
smells good.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.681
See, it's much
cozier this way.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.183
The more
the merrier.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.684
This is what
it's all about.

20:52.684 --> 20:55.187
Friends,
family.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.189
That's what i missed
all those years.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.191
You are always
welcome, richie.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.693
I hope everyone's hungry
for crown roast.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.195
Let me
help you.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.696
No, ma, sit down,
sit down.

21:04.696 --> 21:08.200
Janice, sit, i have
everything under control.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.701
Oh, janice, sit.

21:09.701 --> 21:12.204
Really, sit.

21:12.704 --> 21:13.705
How's the jacket?

21:13.705 --> 21:15.207
What jacket?

21:15.207 --> 21:17.709
I gave your little brother
a beautiful leather jacket.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.212
You still likin'
the jacket, ton'?

21:20.212 --> 21:21.713
It's terrific.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.715
Excuse me,
i gotta get the ginzu.

21:23.715 --> 21:29.721
What jacket?

21:29.721 --> 21:31.723
Where's my knife?

21:31.723 --> 21:34.726
I want to compliment you
on your behavior out there.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.729
I want him
where i can see him.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.732
That's what we mea
n when we say family.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.740
I'm sorry,
i know i'm late.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.243
I said you could stay
overnight at hunter's,

21:51.243 --> 21:52.744
not miss
sunday dinner.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.746
I said i'm sorry,
you could've paged me.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.248
Was there any
mail yesterday?

21:56.748 --> 21:58.250
It's right there
where it always is.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.751
Go set yourself a place,
we have company.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.261
What happened
to this?

22:09.761 --> 22:10.762
Hello?

22:10.762 --> 22:12.264
Carmela?
Hi.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.266
It's jeannie cusamano.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.268
Oh, hi, hi,
how are you?

22:16.268 --> 22:18.770
Listen carmela,
i spoke to my sister

22:18.770 --> 22:20.272
about the letter
for meadow,

22:20.772 --> 22:23.775
and she's sorry, but
she can't do it, i'm sorry.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.777
She can't,
why not?

22:25.777 --> 22:29.281
Because she already wrote
a letter for someone else.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.283
A wonderful young
dominican man

22:31.783 --> 22:34.786
from the housing projects
with a 5. 2 average

22:34.786 --> 22:36.788
and a crack- addict
mother,

22:37.289 --> 22:42.294
and cerebral palsy.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.796
So, what does that mean,
she can't send two?

22:45.297 --> 22:48.300
Did you think about
asking one of the priests
at the church?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.302
A letter
from father intintola

22:50.302 --> 22:52.304
would probably mean
even more, i bet,

22:52.304 --> 22:53.805
especially
at georgetown.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.807
I gotta go, bye.

22:55.807 --> 22:59.811
Good luck.

22:59.811 --> 23:02.314
Who was that?

23:02.314 --> 23:04.816
Can't send
2 what, mom?

23:04.816 --> 23:06.318
It's nothing.

23:11.823 --> 23:13.325
Joan.

23:13.325 --> 23:15.327
I know you said you didn't
want to be interrupted,

23:15.827 --> 23:18.330
but there's a carmela soprano
here to see you.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.831
You're kidding.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.333
She's not in your daytimer,
you want me to handle it?

23:21.333 --> 23:24.836
Christ.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.338
Send her in.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.340
Excuse me.

23:28.840 --> 23:29.841
Joan, hi.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.843
Is this
a bad time?

23:31.843 --> 23:33.345
Always.

23:33.345 --> 23:36.848
C'mon in.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.350
Ricotta pie
with pineapples.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.352
I was in
the neighborhood.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.354
My mother's foot surgeon
is over here.

23:42.354 --> 23:45.357
Oh, thank you.

23:45.357 --> 23:48.360
Listen, carmela, i think
i know why you're here.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.362
My sister told me
you wanted me

23:50.362 --> 23:53.865
to write a letter to georgetown
for "fielder", is it?

23:53.865 --> 23:54.866
Meadow.

23:54.866 --> 23:55.867
Sorry.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.370
But i just
can't do it.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.372
Well, i thought you would
at least want

24:00.372 --> 24:02.874
to take a look
at her grades

24:02.874 --> 24:04.376
and her sat scores
and some teacher comments

24:04.376 --> 24:06.378
before you made up
your mind.

24:06.378 --> 24:09.381
I think she would be
a wonderful addition
to the georgetown campus.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.383
Then i'm sure
the admissions offices
will see that.

24:11.883 --> 24:13.885
Well, i'm not
sure that's true.

24:13.885 --> 24:16.388
The sad fact is that's just
not enough these days.

24:16.888 --> 24:20.392
I'm sorry, carmela
, but i can't do it.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.894
I don't think
you understand.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.897
I want you
to write that letter.

24:26.398 --> 24:27.899
Excuse me?

24:27.899 --> 24:30.402
I said i want you
to write the letter.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.403
Are you
threatening me?

24:31.903 --> 24:32.904
Threat,
what threatening?

24:33.405 --> 24:36.408
I brought you a ricotta pie
and high school transcripts

24:36.408 --> 24:37.909
so you could write
a letter of recommendation

24:37.909 --> 24:40.412
for my little daughter
to georgetown.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.913
I'm an officer
of the court.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.916
A lawyer.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.419
Don't make me
beg here.

24:47.419 --> 24:50.922
I've already written
my last letter of support

24:50.922 --> 24:52.424
for this
academic year.

24:52.924 --> 24:53.925
How about this,

24:53.925 --> 24:56.428
i thought you could write
a letter to georgetown,

24:56.428 --> 24:57.929
tell them
you discovered

24:57.929 --> 24:59.931
that georgetown was not
that person's first choice,

24:59.931 --> 25:01.933
and that in fact he was using
georgetown as a backup--

25:02.434 --> 25:06.438
i'm not gonna tell you
what to write.

25:06.438 --> 25:09.441
Oh my god, i left my mother
in the car with that foot.

25:09.441 --> 25:12.444
Thanks for this.

25:21.953 --> 25:25.957
Ask the kid
to fix me a burger.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.459
Holy fuck,
shit.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.961
We should've
at least said hello.

25:29.961 --> 25:34.466
Or asked him what time
it was or something.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.968
Think we should
go in?

25:36.968 --> 25:39.471
How do i look?

25:39.971 --> 25:41.473
Good.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.475
Your hair, though,
yeah.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.986
Hey, hi tony,
how the fuck's it going?

25:54.986 --> 25:55.987
How ya doin'?

25:55.987 --> 25:58.490
Matt drinkwater,
ivo bevelaqua's nephew.

25:58.490 --> 25:59.991
My partner,
sean gismonte.

25:59.991 --> 26:01.993
We're friends of christopher,
we worked the executive
card game.

26:01.993 --> 26:04.496
I know,
how you doing?

26:04.496 --> 26:06.498
That dancer,
destinee, out there?

26:06.498 --> 26:09.501
I'd like to break my dick off
in that ass of hers.

26:20.512 --> 26:23.014
Just so you know,
chrissy spoke to us about

26:23.014 --> 26:26.017
you wanted we should give you
a taste from those tapes--

26:26.518 --> 26:29.020
jesus fucking christ,
you stupid shit- eating twat.

26:29.020 --> 26:33.024
You ever hear
of wiretaps?

26:33.024 --> 26:34.526
Look what you did.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.027
Because you made me
do all the talking.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.029
You always
do that.

26:38.029 --> 26:40.031
You get all quiet,
you leave me hanging

26:40.031 --> 26:43.535
in the motherfucking
cocksucking wind.

26:43.535 --> 26:47.038
What is so important
you're gonna make a man late
for the first post?

26:47.038 --> 26:49.040
We heard from
gia gaeta

26:49.040 --> 26:51.543
your little nephew
s ripped up the house

26:51.543 --> 26:53.545
and then haven't
been back there.

26:53.545 --> 26:57.048
I needed the guys
to do some work
on janice's mother's house.

26:57.048 --> 27:00.552
Which all due respect
is also your boss's
mother's house.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.554
Gentlemen.

27:03.054 --> 27:04.055
Ton'.

27:04.055 --> 27:07.559
These guys won't shut up
about this fucking ramp.

27:07.559 --> 27:11.062
Richie,
relax, sit down.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.064
I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.575
Where's
the jacket?

27:23.575 --> 27:25.577
You're not
wearing the jacket.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.580
It's in the car,
you want it back?

27:28.580 --> 27:32.083
I gave tony a jacket
i took off rocco dimeo.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.585
Cocksucker
had a reputation

27:33.585 --> 27:36.087
as being the toughest guy
in essex county.

27:36.087 --> 27:42.093
But he didn't come back here
when i got through with him.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.095
...then we were doing
an interview and
i asked if i could do it...

27:46.097 --> 27:47.599
carmela?

27:47.599 --> 27:49.100
Hi.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.602
Hi.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.103
Jean, hi,
c'mon in.

27:52.103 --> 27:53.104
Your plate.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.107
My sister said
the ricotta pie
was delicious

27:56.107 --> 27:58.610
and the family
loved it.

27:58.610 --> 28:01.613
She also said that she reviewed
meadow's transcripts,

28:01.613 --> 28:04.616
and she was knocked
the fuck out by those
teacher recommendations.

28:05.116 --> 28:08.119
She sat right down
and wrote a terrific
letter to georgetown.

28:08.119 --> 28:09.120
That's wonderful.

28:09.621 --> 28:10.622
Yeah.

28:10.622 --> 28:11.623
Do you have
a copy?

28:12.123 --> 28:13.625
No, but i'll get you one,
no problem.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.127
Thank you so much.

28:16.127 --> 28:20.131
Jean, you are
a wonderful friend.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.634
Did i tell you
how impressed joan was

28:23.134 --> 28:25.136
with meadow's
transcripts?

28:25.136 --> 28:27.138
You did,
thank you.

28:35.647 --> 28:39.651
Howie t, bro,
blood's flaying on the mix.

28:40.151 --> 28:45.156
We oughta score some vega's
to kick the fucking
bass up on this tv.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.161
What the fuck,
what's that?

29:14.135 --> 29:16.638
Fuck, it's that fucking
zip furio and somebody.

29:16.638 --> 29:18.139
What the fuck?

29:18.640 --> 29:20.642
Let him in before
he kicks the door down.

29:31.653 --> 29:33.655
Furio, right?

29:33.655 --> 29:35.156
We're here
for the money.

29:35.156 --> 29:37.158
The money?

29:37.158 --> 29:39.160
The boss money.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.162
Oh, the money,
okay, sure.

29:41.162 --> 29:47.669
Get tony's money.

29:48.169 --> 29:49.671
Bella televisione.

29:49.671 --> 29:53.675
Hdtv compatible.

29:53.675 --> 29:56.678
You guys want
something to drink,
beer, soda?

29:56.678 --> 29:58.680
Just the money.

30:05.186 --> 30:07.188
10*, right?
75 hundred.

30:07.188 --> 30:10.692
It's all there.

30:10.692 --> 30:14.696
Give me
$1, 000.

30:14.696 --> 30:16.197
$1, 000 more?

30:16.698 --> 30:18.199
Christopher said
ten percent.

30:18.199 --> 30:19.701
$1, 000.

30:19.701 --> 30:21.202
I can't fucking
believe this.

30:21.202 --> 30:22.704
You're ripping us off
for a g- note.

30:22.704 --> 30:24.205
This is bullshit.

30:30.211 --> 30:31.713
C'mon, hurry up.

30:47.729 --> 30:51.733
What'd you
say to him?

30:51.733 --> 30:53.234
Have a nice day.

31:09.250 --> 31:15.757
Jesus fucking
mother of christ,
christopher.

31:16.257 --> 31:18.259
You want one?

31:18.259 --> 31:22.764
No, i'll have
a puff of yours.

31:22.764 --> 31:23.765
Man.

31:24.265 --> 31:30.271
I know.

31:30.271 --> 31:33.274
If i knew it was gonna
keep getting better and better,

31:33.274 --> 31:35.777
i would have asked you
to marry me sooner.

31:36.277 --> 31:38.780
Like it wasn't
always good?

31:38.780 --> 31:41.282
Ow.

31:41.783 --> 31:43.284
Christopher.

31:43.284 --> 31:45.787
What?

31:45.787 --> 31:47.789
Nothing,
just--

31:47.789 --> 31:49.791
i love my ring.

31:55.296 --> 31:57.298
T was right.

31:57.298 --> 31:59.801
He set me straight
that shit he said to me.

32:00.301 --> 32:02.303
No more
distractions...

32:02.303 --> 32:06.307
focus, no drugs,
eye on the prize.

32:06.307 --> 32:09.310
I'm back on track,
adriana.

32:09.310 --> 32:12.814
I'm rededicating myself
right down the line.

32:13.314 --> 32:16.818
I don't know
why we always fight.

32:16.818 --> 32:18.820
It's my fault.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.822
I don't
communicate my needs.

32:20.822 --> 32:22.824
We waste
so much time.

32:23.324 --> 32:24.325
You're right.

32:24.325 --> 32:30.331
Let's not--

32:30.331 --> 32:32.333
i love you so much.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.335
I love you, too.

32:49.350 --> 32:52.353
Lilliana,
can you get that?

32:54.355 --> 32:55.857
Richie!

32:55.857 --> 32:58.359
What a surprise,
what brings you this way?

32:58.359 --> 32:59.861
How are you
today, dear?

33:00.361 --> 33:02.363
This is to thank you
for sunday dinner.

33:02.864 --> 33:04.365
Some tripe and tomatoes
i made.

33:04.365 --> 33:08.369
We gotta be the only two people
who still like tripe.

33:08.369 --> 33:10.872
My god, richie,
thank you.

33:10.872 --> 33:13.374
It's for you,
for later, for dinner,

33:13.374 --> 33:15.376
for whatever
you want to do with it.

33:15.376 --> 33:18.880
The kids are gonna freak out
when they see this.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.883
I just made some fresh drip,
do you want a cup?

33:21.883 --> 33:25.386
Sure, why not?

33:25.887 --> 33:27.388
So, richie,

33:27.889 --> 33:29.891
you and par--
janice...

33:29.891 --> 33:31.893
this is no
flash in the pan.

33:32.393 --> 33:35.396
Yeah, it's ironic
how life works.

33:35.396 --> 33:37.398
She goes to sri lanka
or wherever,

33:37.398 --> 33:39.400
i go where i went...

33:39.901 --> 33:44.405
and here we are back
where we started 20 years ago.

33:44.906 --> 33:47.408
For every shoe
there is a mate.

33:47.408 --> 33:49.410
Mrs. Carmela,

33:49.410 --> 33:52.914
sorry, but my husband has come
to get the extra tv set
from the basement

33:52.914 --> 33:54.415
you said
i could have.

33:54.916 --> 33:59.921
Sure,
go right ahead.

33:59.921 --> 34:05.426
If there is one thing
we don't lack around here
it's television sets.

34:05.426 --> 34:07.929
Lilliana, the remote is
down there somewhere, too.

34:07.929 --> 34:09.931
It's on the shelves.

34:09.931 --> 34:12.433
Hello, mrs. ,
thank you for tv.

34:12.433 --> 34:16.437
Oh, please,
enjoy.

34:16.437 --> 34:17.938
The poor thing.

34:17.938 --> 34:20.942
In poland he was
a mechanical engineer,

34:20.942 --> 34:22.443
here's he's
driving a cab.

34:22.944 --> 34:25.446
What's the matter,
you alright?

34:25.446 --> 34:29.449
I'm fine,
i'm fine.

34:29.951 --> 34:30.952
I gotta go.

34:41.462 --> 34:42.964
Answering machine.

34:42.964 --> 34:44.966
Friggin' christopher,
where is he?

34:44.966 --> 34:46.967
He's always here.

35:04.485 --> 35:05.987
This is fucked.

35:05.987 --> 35:07.488
What?

35:07.488 --> 35:09.490
This, us,
look at us.

35:09.490 --> 35:11.993
We're like two fucking
scared rabbits or something,

35:11.993 --> 35:12.994
douchebags.

35:12.994 --> 35:14.495
Don't say that.

35:14.495 --> 35:16.497
Sean, for chrissakes,
grow up to reality.

35:16.497 --> 35:17.999
We are nowhere.

35:17.999 --> 35:21.002
Buying fish, punching safes,
what is that, for what?

35:21.002 --> 35:23.004
We're just getting started,
it's what you do.

35:23.004 --> 35:25.006
We got
stockbroker licenses.

35:25.006 --> 35:27.508
I went to
pace college.

35:35.516 --> 35:36.517
Fuck.

35:36.517 --> 35:38.019
It's true, huh?

35:38.519 --> 35:39.520
We're fucked.

35:39.520 --> 35:45.026
We gotta do something
to get ahead in this world.

35:45.026 --> 35:48.029
Mom, i don't believe it
and don't try to deny it!

35:48.529 --> 35:51.032
I told you not to let
lilliana into my room!

35:51.032 --> 35:53.534
Look at the money they waste
on these cd roms.

35:53.534 --> 35:56.537
"Mindspring",
"earthlink",

35:56.537 --> 35:58.039
what are these,
exactly?

35:58.039 --> 36:00.041
I don't know and
don't change the subject,

36:00.041 --> 36:01.042
it's my room!

36:01.042 --> 36:02.543
There were clothes
a foot deep on the floor.

36:03.044 --> 36:05.046
You had half
the bath towels in there.

36:05.046 --> 36:06.047
Don't exaggerate!

36:06.047 --> 36:08.049
Wet, it was
starting to smell.

36:08.049 --> 36:10.051
It's my room and if
i want it like that

36:10.051 --> 36:11.552
that's the way
i want it!

36:11.552 --> 36:13.054
I don't bitch you out
about your room.

36:13.054 --> 36:15.056
Your room
is in my house.

36:15.056 --> 36:16.057
And as long as
you live in my house,

36:16.557 --> 36:17.558
there are
gonna be limits.

36:17.558 --> 36:19.560
I won't be here for long,
i'm 18 years old!

36:19.560 --> 36:21.062
I'm going to be going
to college soon,

36:21.062 --> 36:23.564
i can take care of myself
so just bug out, okay?

36:23.564 --> 36:24.065
Oh, you can?

36:24.565 --> 36:29.570
That's right!

36:30.071 --> 36:31.572
You know what?
You're right.

36:32.073 --> 36:34.075
You are right.

36:34.075 --> 36:35.576
You can take care
of yourself.

36:35.576 --> 36:37.578
Thank you.

36:37.578 --> 36:41.582
You're gonna be going off
all on your own
to a wonderful college.

36:42.083 --> 36:44.085
What right do i have
to interfere?

37:01.102 --> 37:03.104
What's going on?

37:03.104 --> 37:05.106
Nothing i can
think of.

37:05.106 --> 37:08.609
Except
it's tuesday, 3:00.

37:09.110 --> 37:15.616
So we gotta
talk about something.

37:16.117 --> 37:18.619
Okay,
spin the wheel.

37:18.619 --> 37:21.122
Here's something
that's been bothering me.

37:21.122 --> 37:23.624
I gave
my daughter a car.

37:23.624 --> 37:24.625
Really?

37:24.625 --> 37:26.127
Yeah, used car,

37:26.127 --> 37:28.129
one of those suv's,
a'92 pathfinder.

37:28.129 --> 37:31.632
The thing is, it belonged to
a friend of hers from school,

37:31.632 --> 37:33.134
and it came
into my possession

37:33.134 --> 37:36.137
because of a debt
incurred to me
by the kid's father.

37:36.137 --> 37:38.139
And this is the way
he elected to make payment.

37:38.139 --> 37:41.142
You gave her
her friend's car.

37:41.142 --> 37:43.144
It was a nice,
safe car,

37:43.144 --> 37:45.146
to which
i had the pink slip.

37:45.146 --> 37:46.647
What's bothering you?

37:46.647 --> 37:49.150
I must've know
n that she'd know

37:49.650 --> 37:51.652
that it was this
fucking kid eric's car

37:51.652 --> 37:53.654
and how i got it,
you know,

37:53.654 --> 37:56.157
and she'd freak out.

37:56.657 --> 37:58.159
Then why'd
you give it to her?

37:58.159 --> 38:03.164
I don't know.

38:03.164 --> 38:05.166
For all these years

38:05.166 --> 38:11.172
i've been shielding her
and protecting her
from certain truths.

38:11.172 --> 38:13.674
So now i want to
rub her nose in it?

38:13.674 --> 38:15.176
Any thoughts
on that?

38:20.681 --> 38:23.684
This kid's father,
he's a fucking
degenerate gambler.

38:23.684 --> 38:27.188
But he's also a respected
businessman in the community

38:27.688 --> 38:29.690
and everything that
goes along with that.

38:29.690 --> 38:31.192
One of your
happy wanderers.

38:31.692 --> 38:36.197
How do you
remember this shit?

38:36.197 --> 38:39.200
So, it becomes my fault
that he lost his kid's car?

38:39.200 --> 38:41.702
I gotta look out for him
because he's a sick bastard?

38:41.702 --> 38:43.704
My friend artie bucco's
got a restaurant, right?

38:43.704 --> 38:46.207
Now, believe me,
no one's telling him

38:46.207 --> 38:48.209
to refuse
a plate of fettucini

38:48.209 --> 38:51.712
to some fat fuck
that wanders in that's
eating himself to death.

38:51.712 --> 38:54.715
Maybe that's what you were
saying to your daughter.

38:54.715 --> 38:55.716
What?

38:55.716 --> 38:57.218
By giving her the suv,

38:57.718 --> 39:01.722
wanting her to confront
some of these
moral ambiguities.

39:01.722 --> 39:03.224
English.

39:03.224 --> 39:07.228
Meadow's going to be going
away to college next year.

39:07.228 --> 39:09.230
Yeah, that's why
she needs the car.

39:09.230 --> 39:10.731
Leaving the nest.

39:10.731 --> 39:12.733
Not those
fucking ducks again.

39:12.733 --> 39:14.735
Maybe you were
preparing her for reality,

39:14.735 --> 39:16.237
teaching her to fly.

39:16.237 --> 39:17.738
You people
are something.

39:17.738 --> 39:19.240
I gave my
little daughter a car

39:19.240 --> 39:21.242
to rub her face
in shit,

39:21.742 --> 39:24.745
and you're telling me
i did something noble?

39:24.745 --> 39:30.751
We're getting
to something here.

39:30.751 --> 39:32.253
Time's up.

39:32.253 --> 39:34.255
We still have time
and we're doing good work.

39:34.255 --> 39:37.258
What?
You feel you're cured?

39:37.258 --> 39:39.260
Fine,
i'll sit here.

39:39.260 --> 39:41.762
But i got
nothing else to say.

39:47.268 --> 39:49.770
Yeah,
you called me?

39:50.271 --> 39:52.773
Oh, get the fuck
out of here, paulie.

39:52.773 --> 39:54.775
I'm supposed to go
all the way over there

39:54.775 --> 39:56.777
to check on
a fucking ramp?

39:56.777 --> 39:58.779
Yo, christopher,
what's up?

39:58.779 --> 40:03.284
What's up, man?

40:03.284 --> 40:07.788
Get that
motherfucker!

40:07.788 --> 40:08.789
Get him!

40:09.290 --> 40:11.292
Fucking seatbelt!

40:37.318 --> 40:38.319
Richie.

40:38.819 --> 40:39.320
Yeah.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.821
Matt drinkwater,
bevelaqua.

40:41.322 --> 40:43.324
You hear what happened
to christopher moltisanti?

40:43.324 --> 40:44.825
Yeah, somebody
blew him up.

40:44.825 --> 40:46.327
It was us,
me and sean.

40:46.327 --> 40:48.329
You?

40:48.829 --> 40:51.332
Sean is fucking dead,
christopher killed him.

40:51.332 --> 40:53.834
So, what the fuck
are you doing here?

40:53.834 --> 40:55.336
We did it for you
as a favor.

40:55.336 --> 40:57.338
What the fuck
are you talking about?

40:57.338 --> 40:58.339
'Cause you
don't like him.

40:58.839 --> 40:59.340
So what?

40:59.840 --> 41:01.842
He hit
your niece.

41:01.842 --> 41:03.844
Jesus, are you
fucking crazy?

41:04.345 --> 41:05.846
That's all i need now

41:05.846 --> 41:07.348
for that two- faced
ungrateful fuck

41:07.348 --> 41:09.350
to think i had
any part of this.

41:09.350 --> 41:10.851
You gotta
help me, man.

41:10.851 --> 41:15.356
I'll help you,
i'll fucking help you!

41:15.356 --> 41:17.358
You gotta hide me,
i'm with you now.

41:17.358 --> 41:18.859
Who told you
to do that?

41:19.360 --> 41:22.363
Get out of here,
you dumb fuck,
i'll kill you!

41:38.879 --> 41:41.882
How can this happen?

41:41.882 --> 41:45.886
How could
this happen?
