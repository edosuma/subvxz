You don't have to like 'em, Arlo.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.929
You just have to feed 'em.

(GRUNTS)

08:45.960 --> 08:47.291
That should do it.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.842
Now, this will keep them rotten critters
from stealing our food

08:51.000 --> 08:54.129
because I made this silo
100% critter-proof.

it's her.

Did you just put your mark
higher than mine?

09:17.280 --> 09:21.126
What? No.
It's just the angle you're looking at it.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.521

If this keeps up, we won't have
enough food to survive the winter.

to a real high point,

49:33.320 --> 49:36.324

If you ain't scared of a croc

It's like Mother Nature,
