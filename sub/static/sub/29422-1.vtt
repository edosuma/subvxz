When are you going to bring the food?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.022
When I've lost my appetite?

05:14.105 --> 05:16.274
Or what kind of rubbish is this?

05:16.357 --> 05:18.192
Just take a look at our friend,

05:18.276 --> 05:22.697
Ah, ageless mama, See her skin glowing,

05:23.406 --> 05:26.159

What? Whose skin is glowing?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.786
This useless one that has
bleached her entire life away

and looks like a Gambian turkey?

05:31.748 --> 05:34.167

Her food will choke you,

[in English]
You just have eyes, you can't see,

05:46.596 --> 05:49.766

Oh, you're welcome to,

07:11.139 --> 07:15.726
Is that not Governor Onikoyi?
And look at this man laughing and relaxed,

07:16.144 --> 07:18.688
Maybe I should go and pitch him
one of my top-notch ideas,

07:19.480 --> 07:24.026
Man, Kitan, Look, your mum

09:52.341 --> 09:54.343
Senator, my mother
didn't get where she is today

09:54.427 --> 09:56.387
by breaking her promises,

09:56.887 --> 10:01.017
There's been no official appointment yet,
so until then, we wait,

10:01.642 --> 10:03.269
That's fine, that's fine,

10:03.352 --> 10:07.023
But I just want to remind you

10:09.650 --> 10:10.735
Remind?

10:12.194 --> 10:14.488
With all due respect, Senator,

10:14.572 --> 10:18.993
you of all people should know that
my mother doesn't take kindly to threats,

10:19.577 --> 10:22.622
I'd be mindful not to
tug the tail of the lion if I were you,

10:23.456 --> 10:27.627
We will get to you after the announcement
has been made, as promised,

10:28.294 --> 10:31.464
So until then, Senator,
try to stay out of danger,

10:32.381 --> 10:36.969

a very dangerous city,

10:37.053 --> 10:40.890
as you and your family must know,
Enjoy the rest of the party, sir,

Chief Davies' daughter?

12:47.391 --> 12:49.435
Please have mercy, Boss,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.941
I hate when people waste my time,

Yes, I told him, I went to see him,

14:36.834 --> 14:39.670
If you see the way he treated me,

14:39.753 --> 14:42.715
He insulted me,

14:42.798 --> 14:47.344
my children and my family,

14:47.428 --> 14:51.473
He belittled my daughter,,,

14:52.766 --> 14:55.227
after humiliating her,

14:57.646 --> 14:58.647
Please save me,

14:59.231 --> 15:04.570
Mama,,, are you sure he's the one?

15:05.946 --> 15:07.239
He's the one,

15:07.907 --> 15:11.535
If you want me to swear
in my child's name,

15:12.244 --> 15:16.248
My child is very naive,

15:16.874 --> 15:21.253
That's why he took advantage of her

15:21.754 --> 15:24.048
He has totally destroyed her life,

15:24.131 --> 15:28.469
Mama, it's okay,
Tears are not allowed here,

15:28.552 --> 15:29.929

16:19.728 --> 16:25.651
Or do you want to hear news of his death?

16:28.696 --> 16:29.905
Which do you prefer?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.074
What did you just say?

[in English]
I will not repeat myself,

16:41.792 --> 16:43.919
[in Yoruba]
Ah, what a pity

16:44.545 --> 16:48.382
What a pity, This man disgraced me,

16:49.008 --> 16:54.096

But it won't go that way,

16:54.179 --> 16:57.558
[in English]
Mama, You have not answered my question,

16:58.350 --> 16:59.393

17:03.272 --> 17:04.982
King,,,

17:05.065 --> 17:10.612
The deed has been done,

17:10.695 --> 17:12.781

It's marriage,

What you just said,,,

18:32.820 --> 18:36.365
The young, old, male, female,,,

18:36.448 --> 18:42.371
In fact, the whole market belongs to you,

18:44.373 --> 18:46.208
You are in!

18:46.291 --> 18:47.876
[laughing]

18:58.679 --> 19:00.848
Do we still have people outside?

19:01.431 --> 19:03.433
All the way down the street, mum,

Are you okay?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.754
[woman] This is the one
I was telling you about, ma,

19:32.838 --> 19:35.257
It will make you stand out very well,

19:35.340 --> 19:37.384
It's very pretty, Mummy, see,

19:37.467 --> 19:41.555
Mmm, yes, It's fine, but,,,

19:41.638 --> 19:42.848
[in Yoruba] It's very expensive,

19:42.931 --> 19:45.517
-Please let me look at something else,
-[in Yoruba] Please don't say that,

19:45.601 --> 19:48.729
You shall eat whatever you desire
You shall drink whatever you desire

19:48.812 --> 19:50.522
You shall wear whatever you desire,
by God's grace,

19:50.606 --> 19:53.442
[in English] Just tell God, it is done,
Are you the bride?

19:53.525 --> 19:54.943
-Yes, ma,
-Come here,

19:57.905 --> 19:59.156
You are beautiful,

19:59.781 --> 20:03.243
[in Yoruba] Ma'am! How many times
will your daughter have a wedding?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.536
It's just once,

20:04.620 --> 20:09.333
You have to make your in-laws see
that your child is as precious as gold

20:09.416 --> 20:11.293
and she's not ordinary,

20:11.376 --> 20:12.377
Do you understand me?

20:12.461 --> 20:15.297
-I understand but--
-There are no buts!

20:15.380 --> 20:17.049
There are no buts in your life,

20:17.132 --> 20:18.342
Give it to me

20:18.425 --> 20:20.969
There are no buts in your life,
Can you come closer, my darling?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.721
I will show you something,

20:22.804 --> 20:26.892
[in English] Give me your hand,
Your beautiful hand, [chuckles]

20:27.184 --> 20:28.352
Just look at this,

[in Yoruba]
Ma'am, take a look, Give me your hand,

20:31.021 --> 20:33.440
Feel that, Run it though,

20:33.523 --> 20:34.524
Wow,

20:34.608 --> 20:35.776
Feel that?

20:36.360 --> 20:39.279
Can you feel that? Beautiful,

20:39.363 --> 20:41.657
You see, this was handmade,

20:41.740 --> 20:46.662
Everything you see here was hand-crafted,
It is neck breaking labor,

20:46.745 --> 20:48.497
I know what we're giving you,

20:48.580 --> 20:50.457
[in Yoruba]
May this child benefit from you,

20:50.540 --> 20:52.251
[in English]
Sweetheart, do you like it?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.461
Yes, ma, it does really make my skin pop,

20:54.544 --> 20:56.004
Oh, my God! Pop!

20:56.088 --> 21:00.467
[in Yoruba] You've got it spot on!
Your daughter wants this badly,

21:00.550 --> 21:02.970
-You know what is good!
-Good afternoon, ma,

21:03.220 --> 21:05.806
Ah, Can you please go into my office?

21:05.889 --> 21:08.392
When I'm done with my customer,
I'll meet you in a minute, okay?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.185
-Okay, ma,
-Thank you,

21:10.269 --> 21:13.230
[in Yoruba] Ah, thank you, my dear,
What were we talking about?

21:13.313 --> 21:15.107
Let me tell you something,

21:15.190 --> 21:17.693
If you have money that
covers the entire world

21:17.776 --> 21:19.653
and you don't spend it on your child,

21:19.736 --> 21:21.071
It's all a waste,

21:21.154 --> 21:23.573
If we die today,
will the money be buried with us?

21:24.533 --> 21:25.659
No,

21:25.742 --> 21:27.160
Do you see this child?

21:27.244 --> 21:29.329
I'm tapping into your grace,

21:29.413 --> 21:32.291
I have two children, A boy and a girl,

21:32.916 --> 21:36.128
And I am praying for a day like this,

21:36.211 --> 21:39.089
I am praying for both a son-in-law
and a daughter-in-law,

21:39.172 --> 21:42.384
So because of that, I will sow
into your daughter's wedding,

21:42.467 --> 21:43.844
-Huh?
-Yes,

21:43.927 --> 21:47.597
I know how much I bought this fabric
and I know what my profit should be,

21:47.681 --> 21:52.644
My profit is 5% and I'll take it off,
Just pay the cost price

21:53.061 --> 21:54.938
[in English]
Thank you so very much, madam,

21:55.689 --> 21:58.650
You see, I didn't come
expecting to spend that much,

21:58.734 --> 22:00.694
[in Yoruba]
Ah, what are you talking about?

22:00.777 --> 22:03.447
If that's the situation,
I have a POS machine,

22:03.530 --> 22:04.573
Bring the machine!

22:04.656 --> 22:07.951
You see, this store is yours,

22:08.035 --> 22:10.120
Come in and take whatever you want,
Do you understand?

22:10.203 --> 22:12.122
Now I know you, and we've become family,
Do you understand?

22:12.205 --> 22:16.626
[in English] Just make her happy,
Make her happy, please,

22:17.377 --> 22:18.378
Okay,

22:19.254 --> 22:20.756
Thank you, Mummy,

22:20.839 --> 22:23.592
Well done, well done,

22:23.675 --> 22:25.052
I pray you enjoy it,

22:25.135 --> 22:26.762
[in Yoruba]
God will make it a day of joy for you,

22:26.845 --> 22:29.890
Fantastic!
Unfortunately, I have to leave you,

22:29.973 --> 22:31.433
I need to attend to the other guest,

22:31.516 --> 22:34.436
Nneka, the shoe and bag,
don't forget to show them,

22:36.480 --> 22:37.606
Shoe and bag?

22:41.568 --> 22:44.362
-[in Pidgin] Boss, you know what happened?
-What happened?

22:44.446 --> 22:47.699
That's what I was expecting from you!
You have just been,,,

22:47.783 --> 22:50.660
So, Boss,
as I tried to position myself,

22:50.744 --> 22:51.787
Do you understand me?

22:51.870 --> 22:54.664
Oh, God, Bosco, speak,

22:54.748 --> 22:57.459
It hurts that you guys
weren't there to see what I did,

22:58.043 --> 22:59.753
As soon as I charged,,,

22:59.836 --> 23:03.465
they just kept looking at me and started
bringing out their guns and grenades,

23:03.548 --> 23:04.966
[hip-hop playing]

23:05.050 --> 23:08.095
I didn't have any weapons with me,
but I stood my ground firmly,

23:08.178 --> 23:10.931
The weed I was smoking before
I left you guys just kicked into action

23:11.014 --> 23:13.100
and everything switched to slow motion,

23:13.183 --> 23:15.894
Then I attacked, and ten people fell,

23:18.730 --> 23:21.650
As one tried to hit me in the chest,
I countered the attack,

23:21.733 --> 23:22.984
Then I hit him again,

23:23.068 --> 23:25.070
Before I realized it,
the 50 men were on the floor,

23:25.153 --> 23:26.780
I didn't even have a scratch,
Boss, take a look,

23:26.863 --> 23:28.240
-Bosco,
-That's me,

23:28.323 --> 23:30.659
The person who talks too much
will definitely tell tall tales,

23:31.993 --> 23:32.994
Don't be upset, boss,

23:33.078 --> 23:34.412
[music stops]

23:37.207 --> 23:38.208
Hey!

23:38.291 --> 23:41.962
-Odogwu Malay!
-My people, I salute,

23:42.045 --> 23:44.548
Maka Bariga, Baddest,

23:44.631 --> 23:47.676
-My G,
-Baddest, baddest, baddest, What's new?

23:47.759 --> 23:49.553
-I'm good
-You're just shining,

23:49.636 --> 23:50.887
What's up?

23:50.971 --> 23:53.765
-Men everywhere,
-That's right, that's right,

23:54.349 --> 23:57.352
Now you've appeared in our hood,
are we safe?

23:57.435 --> 24:00.397
They say if a monkey puts on his sneakers
and steps into the hood,

24:00.480 --> 24:02.023
there must be a mission,

24:02.107 --> 24:05.235
I have something for you,
You'll like what I brought,

24:05.318 --> 24:10.490
Let's just convert here
into a small office, quickly,

24:13.201 --> 24:14.661
So, what's up?

24:14.744 --> 24:18.540
I just got back from Anambra,

24:18.623 --> 24:21.835
My boys over there
got some serious intel for us,

24:21.918 --> 24:25.463
Remember my little brother, Dile?

24:25.547 --> 24:31.845
Dile is really close
to one of Ebele's boys here in Lagos,

24:31.928 --> 24:38.393
So, Dile told me that the man
has about 10 million in his house,

24:39.561 --> 24:41.271
I was shocked, my brother,

24:41.354 --> 24:42.564
10 million Naira?

24:42.647 --> 24:46.109
What's up with you, Makanaki?
10 million Naira?

24:46.193 --> 24:49.696
Did stealing 10 million Naira
get us where we are? 10 million dollars!

24:51.239 --> 24:52.240
In a safe?

24:52.324 --> 24:55.243
No way, Those types
don't put money in safes anymore,

24:55.327 --> 24:58.663
The bastard buried the money
in a septic tank,

24:58.747 --> 25:02.167
You know this whistle-blowing thing
is opening doors like crazy,

25:02.250 --> 25:05.921
Put some money in the hands of these
little boys and they'll start snitching,

25:06.630 --> 25:09.466
The government gives five percent,
but we give 10 percent, that's it,

25:09.549 --> 25:11.384
Makanaki, you totally get it,

25:11.468 --> 25:13.511
I even have bigger intel for you, Maka,

25:13.595 --> 25:16.514
You know Number One?
You know, Aare Akinwande,

25:16.598 --> 25:18.642
Same thing, same thing, my guy,

25:18.725 --> 25:22.062
So, if you have all this info,
why did you bring it to me?

25:22.145 --> 25:27.817
Because, Odogwu, I know you very well,
You're not Santa Claus,

25:27.901 --> 25:31.112
-Why did you bring this deal to me?
-Maka, you're still learning,

25:31.196 --> 25:36.534
Maka, I'm a businessman,
Fifteen percent of zero is zero, you know,

25:36.618 --> 25:40.538
Here's what I want us to do, Makanaki,
I want us to work together,

25:40.622 --> 25:44.376
I'm proposing a partnership,
Let's work together,

25:44.459 --> 25:47.045
Let's get in there and clear out
this money from all three locations,

25:47.128 --> 25:51.716
Maka, this cash will change our lives,
Everything,

25:51.800 --> 25:55.011
If you think we're balling right now,
this is where the real balling starts,

25:56.012 --> 25:57.389
I'm telling you,

25:58.890 --> 26:00.308
Fifty-fifty?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.811
Yeah, You're my nigga, so fifty-fifty,

26:02.894 --> 26:05.689
But that's after we have paid
40% to the King,

26:05.772 --> 26:09.276
-Who? What's she doing in this deal?
-Maka, you surprise me,

26:09.359 --> 26:12.195
-What is her role in this deal?
-Odogwu, please,

26:12.279 --> 26:16.533
Her 40% must get to her
whether she's involved in the deal or not,

26:16.616 --> 26:18.952
Let's just pay her share
and keep what's ours,

26:19.035 --> 26:20.954
Please, This person in question,

26:21.037 --> 26:24.416
When was the last time
she brought anything to the table?

26:24.499 --> 26:26.126
But she still eats from what we catch,

26:27.085 --> 26:29.129
Odogwu, you won't open your eyes,

26:29.879 --> 26:31.715
-But let's talk,
-Okay,

26:35.385 --> 26:36.761
[in English]
What are you telling me?

26:37.387 --> 26:39.306
Aare went back on his promise,

26:39.389 --> 26:42.017
So what are you doing here?

26:43.226 --> 26:46.271
Because I'm not a minister,

26:46.730 --> 26:50.942
[scoffs] I am not a deputy governor,
not even a bloody commissioner!

26:51.026 --> 26:55.030
-Mum, calm down,
-"Calm down?" Ha!

26:55.113 --> 26:57.741
The governor just wants you to know
that he tried his best, ma,

26:57.824 --> 27:00.869
Can you listen
to what this fool is telling me?

27:00.952 --> 27:02.996
Listen to what this fool is saying to me!

27:03.079 --> 27:05.081
So my money, my dollars,

27:05.165 --> 27:08.376
all the money spent
on this bastard election was for nothing?

27:08.460 --> 27:11.296
It's not like that, ma,
We really appreciate all you've done,

27:11.379 --> 27:14.716
Then what exactly happened, Taiwo?
This was a done deal,

27:14.799 --> 27:16.885
-Ha!
-Can I speak freely?

27:16.968 --> 27:18.053
Speak,

27:18.136 --> 27:22.140
Okay, Seems some of the party members
are worried about,,,

27:22.766 --> 27:24.017
your reputation, ma,

27:28.396 --> 27:31.066
What? My reputation?

27:32.609 --> 27:34.319
[in Yoruba]
It will not be well with you,

27:34.402 --> 27:37.447
[in English]
You are mad, My reputation,

27:38.698 --> 27:42.160
So when I was financing the movement,
nobody spoke about reputation,

27:42.243 --> 27:44.412
-Mum, calm down,
-Don't tell me to calm down,

27:44.496 --> 27:48.458
Aare wants to talk about reputation,
Oh, ho! So, I'm the fool!

27:48.541 --> 27:51.211
The moron that was doing
their dirty work for them!

27:53.254 --> 27:59.219
I will send you to Aare,
Tell Aare that I, Eniola,

28:00.637 --> 28:03.223
will take all my money,

28:03.306 --> 28:07.143
All my blood, drop for drop,

28:07.227 --> 28:09.813
-Ma?
-Hey! Can you imagine?

28:10.688 --> 28:15.735
They can't even come themselves,
They sent you rat, to sit in my chair,

28:15.819 --> 28:18.279
I think it's time you leave, Mr, Onitiri,

28:20.698 --> 28:21.825
[sighs]

28:30.291 --> 28:33.461
[man] Mama, Excuse me, ma,

28:33.545 --> 28:34.546
Huh?

28:36.423 --> 28:38.174
[man] Makanaki on the phone, ma,

28:40.510 --> 28:41.553
What is it?

28:41.636 --> 28:43.388
[man] Makanaki, on the phone,

28:43.888 --> 28:45.098
What does he want?

28:45.181 --> 28:50.812
Listen, I am tired
and I am not ready for his trouble now,

28:50.895 --> 28:52.272
-Ma?
-Hmm?

28:52.355 --> 28:54.232
It seems very, very important,

29:03.032 --> 29:04.325
-Korede,
-Mama,

29:04.409 --> 29:06.828
[in Yoruba] Good evening, ma,
It's Makanaki speaking,

29:06.911 --> 29:10.957
-Yes, what is it? How are you?
-Fine, thank you, ma,

29:11.541 --> 29:14.169
[in English] We need to see you,
We have urgent things to talk about,

29:14.252 --> 29:16.337
-What is it?
-Business,

29:16.921 --> 29:18.715
Ah, What kind of business?

29:18.798 --> 29:19.883
[scoffs]

29:20.967 --> 29:24.179
[in Yoruba] Mama, it is wrong
to use parables on elders,

29:24.262 --> 29:25.889
What other business do we discuss?

29:26.306 --> 29:28.141
Please, we need to meet,

29:32.145 --> 29:35.648
[in English]
Korede, listen to me and listen good,

29:36.316 --> 29:39.027
I have enough on my plate

29:39.110 --> 29:42.238
to get involved
with your small, small play,

29:42.322 --> 29:43.823
Just do the needful,

29:44.532 --> 29:48.203
[in Yoruba]
No ill wind must touch my people,

29:49.871 --> 29:51.164
Do you understand?

29:52.499 --> 29:54.876
Pay me my tax, finish,

29:55.919 --> 29:58.922
Other than that, I don't care,

30:01.424 --> 30:02.467
-Take this,
-Yes, ma,

30:02.550 --> 30:04.010
Thank you,

30:07.597 --> 30:09.766
-[man] Gobir,
-Attention, sir!

30:11.601 --> 30:14.604
I hope that you're finding
everything satisfactory,

30:15.522 --> 30:18.775
-Yes, sir, Fine, Really fine, sir,
-That's good,

30:20.735 --> 30:21.945
Nice, isn't it?

30:22.987 --> 30:24.697
Very nice, Very nice, sir,

30:25.073 --> 30:27.909
A gift from my new son-in-law,

30:28.993 --> 30:30.662
-Amazing,
-Yeah,

30:30.745 --> 30:31.955
Let's get to it, sit down,

30:32.038 --> 30:33.248
Thank you, sir,

30:36.584 --> 30:39.462
You will not believe
who we have in custody,

30:41.422 --> 30:43.049
-Who's that?
-Eigbe,

30:43.466 --> 30:45.218
-Eigbe?
-And Rewane,

30:45.301 --> 30:46.678
Ebele Rewane?

30:46.761 --> 30:48.263
Senator Rewane,

30:49.138 --> 30:50.348
Wow!

30:50.431 --> 30:54.853
Both of them were using
the National Petroleum Corporation

30:54.936 --> 31:00.275
as a personal treasury, removing
millions of dollars without conscience,

31:00.358 --> 31:04.112
Anyway, they are both yours right now,

31:05.613 --> 31:08.908
-I want you to take their statements,
-Okay, sir,

31:08.992 --> 31:12.078
Make the necessary
residence verifications,

31:12.161 --> 31:14.747
-Yes, sir,
-The press will be here anytime soon,

31:14.831 --> 31:15.957
Okay, sir,

31:18.167 --> 31:21.546
How is your wife, Hauwa? I heard--

31:21.629 --> 31:24.090
[in Hausa]
Much better now, sir, No problem,

31:24.173 --> 31:26.259
She's much better now,

31:26.342 --> 31:29.178
[in English]
In case you need anything, do let me know,

31:30.305 --> 31:31.306
Okay, sir, I will,

31:35.602 --> 31:36.853

33:09.445 --> 33:11.656
Ah! Who is this? Ah!

33:12.365 --> 33:16.953
Is this not Adekemi of yesterday?
That used to look like a boy,

33:17.036 --> 33:19.956
-[chuckles]
-Ah, the work of God,

33:20.039 --> 33:22.458
you cannot find it
even if you look for it,

33:22.542 --> 33:25.420
Look at how God
has put everything one by one

33:25.503 --> 33:29.590
in every place
and everything is perfection, Ah!

33:29.674 --> 33:31.342

33:33.344 --> 33:36.931
-Thank you, sir,
-Ah, ah, Welcome, Sorry,

33:37.015 --> 33:38.725
[news anchor] The Nigerian government

33:38.808 --> 33:41.019
has officially signed
its whistle-blower policy

33:41.102 --> 33:42.937
which encourages citizens

33:43.021 --> 33:46.232
to report suspected financial crimes
to the authorities,

33:46.816 --> 33:48.860
The policy put in place

33:48.943 --> 33:53.072
in conjunction with the Attorney General,
the federation and the Ministry of Justice

33:53.156 --> 33:57.243

recovered to whistle-blowers,

33:57.326 --> 33:59.162
irrespective of amount,

33:59.746 --> 34:03.916
Imagine the rubbish, Huh?
Imagine this rubbish,

34:04.834 --> 34:09.755
They are encouraging criminals
to harass us

34:09.839 --> 34:12.382
and to blackmail us,

34:12.467 --> 34:16.763
Huh? Is this the reason
why we put him there?

34:16.846 --> 34:19.724
Why we appointed him as president? Huh?

34:19.806 --> 34:22.935
It's the "Corruption today,
corruption tomorrow,

34:23.018 --> 34:25.521
corruption, corruption everywhere!"

34:25.605 --> 34:27.982
Is that what we are going to be eating?

34:28.065 --> 34:30.318
Huh? What is all of that?

34:31.027 --> 34:37.366
Ah, ah, Festus, these are special guests,
How could you bring water for them?

34:37.867 --> 34:42.371
No, no, sir, I actually,
I requested the water, sir,

34:42.455 --> 34:44.956
-Ah? You wanted water?
-Yes, sir,

34:45.041 --> 34:50.088
Okay, you can go, You can go,

35:01.516 --> 35:05.144
Um,,, Mum, I'll just go sort out
that thing I told you about,

35:05.520 --> 35:07.271
Sorry, sir, excuse me,

35:08.272 --> 35:11.317
Ah, the work of God,

35:12.110 --> 35:14.028
[chuckles] Eniola,

35:14.112 --> 35:17.365
-Sir?
-Let us get back to why you are here,

35:17.448 --> 35:18.449
-Hmm?
-Yes, sir,

35:18.533 --> 35:21.828
But before you say anything,
let me tell you--

35:22.245 --> 35:25.873
Personally, I, personally,

35:25.957 --> 35:30.878
I know how-- I know about your,,,
[in Yoruba] What is it called?

35:30.962 --> 35:33.965
[in English]
This thing from inside,,, Agitation!

35:34.799 --> 35:38.177
I know about your agitations
and your concern,

35:39.220 --> 35:40.471
I know how you feel,

35:41.722 --> 35:44.725
I know how you feel,

35:45.643 --> 35:49.981
Hmm? You see, if I tell you

35:50.064 --> 35:52.775
that you are a very important part
of this our movement,

35:52.859 --> 35:54.152
you have to believe me,

35:54.694 --> 35:56.904
Yes, you must believe me,

35:57.905 --> 36:01.951
You're my person, You're my child,

36:04.162 --> 36:07.623
Huh? So when I tell you to be patient,

36:08.124 --> 36:11.294
I know exactly what I am talking about,

36:11.752 --> 36:15.423
You see, it is all about timing,
Simple timing,

36:16.841 --> 36:22.346
That is why the elders of the party,
they have said that,

36:22.430 --> 36:28.644
we need to, uh,,,
we need to keep you aside, uh,

36:28.728 --> 36:32.148
until the next, uh, election,

36:32.899 --> 36:35.318
Ministerial appointment,
that is not for you now,

36:35.693 --> 36:39.363
You see what we are planning is big,
It is bigger!

36:41.449 --> 36:46.996
We're talking about power, Real power!

36:48.164 --> 36:54.712
So you just have to be patient,
because, you see, we,,,

36:55.379 --> 36:59.425
What we're trying to do right now is,,,

36:59.508 --> 37:02.511
to clean up in our heads,

37:03.095 --> 37:07.600
this idea that you are from another world,

37:07.683 --> 37:09.477
-Sir?
-You see, because-- Eh?

37:11.187 --> 37:13.231
What do you mean
by "different world," sir?

37:13.314 --> 37:14.690
With all due respect,

37:14.774 --> 37:15.858
-Eniola,
-Sir?

37:15.942 --> 37:17.526
[in Yoruba]
Don't take it personal,

37:17.610 --> 37:19.278
-[in English] This is politics,
-No, sir,

37:19.362 --> 37:22.448
-Look at--
-No, no, no sir, I just want to know,

37:23.824 --> 37:27.703
Is it this same world that has financed

37:28.663 --> 37:33.709
more than 30 state elections
in this country since 1999?

37:33.793 --> 37:34.794
Eniola--

37:34.877 --> 37:39.131
Or the world you call upon
whenever you need muscle?

37:40.132 --> 37:45.137
Or when they said that Aare
could no longer deliver the south

37:45.221 --> 37:49.475
or Aare could no longer
arrange the streets,,,

37:50.184 --> 37:51.477
Who did you run to?

37:52.853 --> 37:54.522
Who did you come to for help?

37:55.398 --> 37:56.399
Me!

37:57.858 --> 38:01.320
Me, Eniola! And what happened?

38:01.904 --> 38:03.239
People came out!

38:04.490 --> 38:06.367
People came to support you!

38:06.951 --> 38:09.912
Who had the power of the south?

38:10.955 --> 38:13.791
Who had the power of the East?

38:13.874 --> 38:17.044
Eniola, don't get upset for no reason,

38:17.128 --> 38:19.630
Don't, baba! Don't go there!

38:19.714 --> 38:23.551
[in Yoruba]
Don't even go there, Sir, don't!

38:24.135 --> 38:25.803
Take a good look at me,

38:25.886 --> 38:28.764
The locust bean said

38:28.848 --> 38:32.351
that it had never felt insulted

38:32.435 --> 38:36.480
until it reached Okemesi,

38:36.564 --> 38:38.733
where it was called a tick,

38:38.816 --> 38:44.113
Eniola! Have you forgotten?

38:45.364 --> 38:47.491
Have you forgotten the presence
of whom you are standing?

38:47.575 --> 38:51.746
Have you forgotten the presence
of whom you are?

38:51.829 --> 38:53.914
It is I, Aare!

38:53.998 --> 38:55.875
Whatever I say cannot be questioned,

38:55.958 --> 38:58.878
whatever I do can never be questioned,

38:58.961 --> 39:00.504
My word is law,

39:00.588 --> 39:03.549
Ah, Eniola?

39:05.509 --> 39:06.844
Sir,

39:09.764 --> 39:11.057
I apologize, sir,

39:13.142 --> 39:14.977
I was out of line,

39:27.156 --> 39:28.157
Sit down,

39:34.705 --> 39:36.123
[exhales]

39:38.584 --> 39:40.920
Ah, ah, Eniola,

39:41.337 --> 39:45.049
-[in English] Sir,
-You have to be patient, Eh?

39:46.592 --> 39:49.887
You have to be patient,
The things that I have planned for you,

39:52.723 --> 39:54.642
It's bigger than you think,

39:55.267 --> 39:58.062
But you won't be patient,
You will not be patient,

39:59.397 --> 40:06.237
Look, what if we start like this,
because we are family, we're one,

40:06.862 --> 40:11.826
What if we start
by taking one of your children,

40:11.909 --> 40:16.539
and make him or her
the Deputy Commissioner for,

40:16.622 --> 40:19.792
say, Agriculture in Lagos State?

40:21.502 --> 40:23.295
This your boy, what's his name?

40:23.879 --> 40:25.756
-Kitan,
-Yes, Kitan!

40:26.424 --> 40:32.096
If we make Kitan the Deputy Commissioner
for Agriculture in Lagos State,

40:32.179 --> 40:35.933
that will prove to you
that we are one family, Eh?

40:37.768 --> 40:38.811
Thank you very much, sir,

40:38.894 --> 40:41.730
Ah, the things we have in store

But you have to wait,

40:43.691 --> 40:44.859
Thank you, sir,

40:44.942 --> 40:46.819
It's all right, It's okay,

40:46.902 --> 40:53.284
But, sir, can we,,, put Adekemi instead?

40:54.034 --> 40:59.206
Because Kitan just got back,
and he has not really settled,

40:59.665 --> 41:02.543
If it is Adekemi you want,
we will do that,

41:02.877 --> 41:06.922
-That is it, Adekemi will become, Huh?
-Thank you, sir,

41:07.006 --> 41:09.175

57:37.620 --> 57:40.039
Simon? Simon,

57:43.168 --> 57:47.005
He hung up the phone on me, Bastard,

57:51.843 --> 57:52.844
[scoffs]

57:55.472 --> 57:58.391
I can't get ahold of Mr, Onitiri,

57:58.475 --> 58:02.061
He's not picking up my phone calls
or returning my text messages,

58:06.524 --> 58:11.863
Kitan, could you give me like ten minutes?
I need to speak to your sister,

58:14.491 --> 58:16.159
I'm in the middle of breakfast, Mummy,

58:16.242 --> 58:19.287
[in Yoruba]
Please, my love,

58:19.370 --> 58:22.332
[in English]
It's a business discussion, Ten minutes,

58:22.832 --> 58:23.917
[sighs]

58:26.211 --> 58:30.006
So you can discuss important business
with her and you can't discuss with--

58:30.089 --> 58:33.384
Get out! Get up from that table!

58:34.427 --> 58:36.012
What is the matter with you, Kitan?

58:36.095 --> 58:37.972
Must you query me
every time I speak with you?

58:39.265 --> 58:43.186
How many sons give their parents
trouble the way you give me?

58:44.145 --> 58:46.231
[in Yoruba]
Are you doing drugs again?

58:46.314 --> 58:47.857
Get out!

58:47.941 --> 58:49.025
Wow,

58:59.327 --> 59:00.787
Mum, don't you think
that was a bit too harsh?

59:00.870 --> 59:02.163
I don't give a damn, Kemi,

59:04.666 --> 59:06.834
I think the governor and Aare,,,

59:08.211 --> 59:12.382
I suspect they think I have
something to do with those robberies,

59:12.465 --> 59:14.884
Okay, Mum, we may be overthinking things,

59:14.968 --> 59:18.012
I mean, surely they know you wouldn't
jeopardize your relationship with them,

59:18.096 --> 59:22.392
Also, they know that things like this
cannot happen without my consent,

59:22.475 --> 59:25.895
So what, this was some kind of
retaliation for the ministerial snub?

59:25.979 --> 59:27.564
Korede wants to ruin me,

59:28.773 --> 59:30.024
-Mum?
-Yes?

59:30.525 --> 59:32.902
Makanaki has been overreaching
for a while now

59:32.986 --> 59:36.739
and I keep telling you that we need
to send him a strong warning,

59:36.823 --> 59:40.660
You're taking him too lightly
and its making us look weak and afraid,

59:41.202 --> 59:42.495
Weak?

59:42.579 --> 59:47.458
[in Yoruba] The slow crawling of a lion
is not out of fear,

59:48.126 --> 59:50.295
And you also taught me,,,

59:51.296 --> 59:54.966
[in Yoruba] The ram that moves backwards
has gone to summon more power,

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:09.063
[in English]
Kemi, organize a round table meeting,

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:17.739
Kitan! Kitan, darling!

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.324
Hello?

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.784
Can you please come back
to the table and finish your meal?

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.954
[Aare] Don't tell me that you are doing
everything you can,

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:30.251
I just lost 45 million dollars
that I cannot report to the authorities,

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.713
[man] We are on it, sir,
But we have to proceed with caution,

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.423
Eniola is a dangerous adversary,

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:36.549
Eniola?

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.260
[in Yoruba] When a slave
turns on its master, it gets killed,

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.428
Sir?

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:43.473
-My friend, go and get the thing done!
-Noted, sir,

01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:46.351
Hold on, hold on, Yes?

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.019
The pilot said the jet is ready,

01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:49.437
Okay, I'm coming,

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:55.735
And let us get Ebele out of prison
before he begins--

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:58.029
[in Yoruba]
Before he starts to sing like a canary,

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:11.834
[in Yoruba] What's going on?
Boys! Boys! Let's go let's go!

01:01:12.877 --> 01:01:15.880
[in Pidgin]
Hey, Do you realize you are in the hood?

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:19.759
What's going on?

01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:25.473
You think you can come here
without paying the fee? You must pay!

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:31.479
Who do you think you are?
You want me to wreck this car?

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.857
[in Yoruba]
King!

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:40.238
[in Pidgin] Mama, don't be angry,

01:01:40.321 --> 01:01:44.450
We didn't know it was you,
We're your children, please forgive us,

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.704
We didn't realize it was you,
Hey, you, move that thing away from there!

01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:51.499
-[in Yoruba] It's okay,
-Good afternoon, ma!

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.335
-Let me see,
-Good afternoon, ma!

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.045
-Wait, wait!
-Good afternoon, ma!

01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.423
-Karimotu?
-Ma?

01:01:58.506 --> 01:01:59.841
Come, come, come,

01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:03.553
Move quickly! Hurry up!

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:05.054
-Kari?
-Ma?

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:09.183
-[in English] You're still pregnant?
-No, Another one,

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:10.727
Eh?

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:13.521
-How many now?
-Six,

01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:18.317
Ah, Karimotu, What are you trying to do?
To build a football team?

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:19.610
No, ma,

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.321
[in Yoruba]
Take care of yourself, come on,

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.990
This is not right,

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:25.074
[in Yoruba]
Sorry,

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:28.369
How much is your cassava flour?

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.829
It depends on the quantity
you want to buy,

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:32.165
No, just tell me, how much is everything?

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.208
[chattering]

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.793
Okay, 25,000, ma,

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.421
-Karimotu!
-Market must sell!

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.966
Kari, take,

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:43.384
Twenty-five thousand?

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.596
Shh, Quiet, quiet please,

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:49.849
Twenty-five thousand naira
for your cassava flour,

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:53.144
and the rest, please use it
to take care of your children,

01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:58.816
-[in Yoruba] Thank you so much, ma!
-You're pregnant, don't kneel,

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.319
Don't do that, my dear,
Take care of yourself,

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.112
[in English]
Let me go pack the flour for you,

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.907
[in Yoruba] Come back,
I don't need the cassava flour,

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:07.575
The flour is for you and the boys,

01:03:07.658 --> 01:03:10.995
-[cheering]
-Stand up!

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:17.043
The next time I see you,
you must not be pregnant,

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:20.046
I don't want to see you pregnant,
Do you understand?

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:22.215
-If your husband tries to touch you--
-[man] Karimotu!

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.758
I am talking,

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:30.515
If your husband tries to touch you,
look for a nice stick and hit his head,

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:32.308
[in Yoruba]
Have you heard?

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:38.105
[men shouting] Clear the road!

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.955
"You want to do dinner, lunch?"
She's like, "No, come over,"

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:57.750
I'm like,
"Lady, I'm with my younger brother,"

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:02.213
She said, "No! Go drop him off
and come alone,"

01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:08.052
Lanre! Lanre! Minister of lies,

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:09.762
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie,

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:14.517
This is the problem I have with you,
No one can even tell you anything,

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.727
Okay, okay, one quick question,

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:20.773
You're telling me the same babe
we always see dating big boys,

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:24.735
Lagos big boys, private jet having mofos,
came to you,

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:29.198
Lanre, who can't even get her a bicycle,
and said, "Come over alone,"

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:32.535
-I don't-- I don't--
-Get outta here, man! Shit!

01:04:32.618 --> 01:04:37.582
The problem is that he thinks
that money can buy happiness,

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:40.209
That's what he thinks,
You're deluding yourself,

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.962
Some of us have swag,

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:46.424
Some of us know the kinds of things
we tell these girls,

01:04:46.507 --> 01:04:48.467
And I'm not bragging,

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:54.557
Dude, I told her, I said,
"Look, if I come over,,,"

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.976
-See that lady over there?
-Yes, sir,

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.812
Give her anything she wants
from the menu, It's on me,

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.397
-[whooping]
-KT!

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.941
KT for the money! Mm!

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.026
London swag,

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:08.029
[in Pidgin] This London swag
you're trying here won't work,

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:10.865
The girls will eat,
wipe their mouths, and say bye,

01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:12.950
Calm down, Just calm down,

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.872
My brother, my brother, see,

01:05:17.955 --> 01:05:23.711
When I got there and she opened the door,
she was the freaking 15 out of 10,

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:27.632
She said she appreciates the offer,
but she will have to decline,

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.508
And to say thank you for being thoughtful,

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.887
she's paid for all the food and drink
you and your friends have consumed,

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.639
-Oh!
-[groans]

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:36.015
And that you're welcome,

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.685
-Oh, Oh, my God,
-Oh!

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:43.522
-Fine baby girl: 10, KT: 0,
-Oh, my God,

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.942
-Oh, KT, oh, my God,
-That's painful,

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.818
-It's all right, my brother,
-That's painful, that's painful,

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.737
She has finished you,

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.990
-He might as well go to his casket,
-Aunty,,, Well done, ma'am, Good try,

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:05.753
[in Yoruba] Stop crying,
The first time is always the hardest,

01:06:05.836 --> 01:06:08.673
After a while, it gets easier,

01:06:11.008 --> 01:06:12.927
I feel this way sometimes, too,

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:17.306
But when I shut my eyes,
I find myself somewhere else,

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.309
-Where?
-In my mind,

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.561
Stop crying, Sorry,

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:28.776
-Do you understand English?
-I understand, but I can't speak it,

01:06:28.859 --> 01:06:32.321
-That's okay, First, what is your name?
-Eniola,

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:36.158
I'll teach you how to speak in English,
Just repeat after me,

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:39.036
[in English]
My name is Eniola,

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.497
My name is Eniola,

01:06:41.914 --> 01:06:44.291
Nice to meet you, My name is Bunmi,

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:50.297

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:17.199
[man chattering]

01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:45.102
Thank you,

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.362
Akorede is not here,

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:01.410
Anyway,,,

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:05.247
[in Yoruba] To avoid thorns
from poking you in the eyes,,,

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:08.667
you observe them from a safe distance,

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.464
[in English]
Thank you for coming once again,

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.718
I know you're very busy people,

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:24.850
But I must call this emergency meeting
before things get out of hand,

01:08:29.145 --> 01:08:30.648
Nothing moves,,,

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:37.822
I repeat, nothing moves in Lagos
without you people at this table,

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.158
As the head of this table,

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:46.956
I know I have been fair
to this association,

01:08:47.413 --> 01:08:50.876
But today I am not happy!

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.712
God forbid! God forbid!
You are happy in Jesus' name,

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:58.091
No, Apostle, how can I be happy?

01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:03.973
When some small rat

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:08.477
wants to eat and destroy everything I,,,

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.356
everything we all worked for,

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:13.607
[man] I will be rat,

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:27.203
Now that we have a full table,
can we address--

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:32.042
Akorede, we are mates now, right?

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.212
That I have to wait for you,

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:40.968
[in Yoruba]
What a pity, what a pity, what a pity,

01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:45.014
You have taken your finger,

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:50.853
dipped it in hot pepper
and poked your mother in the eye with it,

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:52.897
My name is Makanaki
and I don't have a mother,

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.733
[in Pidgin] Maka, respect the crown,
What is wrong with you?

01:09:55.816 --> 01:09:58.944
What crown are you talking about?

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:02.072
You all fear a lion
that has lost its claws and teeth,

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:05.159
Old glory, old school,

01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:07.203
A mother who can't take care
of her children,

01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:10.706
She's making money from politics,

01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:12.541
[in English]
She has no time for us,

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:16.795
When last has anyone at this table
benefited from this woman?

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:21.550
Huh? Answer, Raise hands, Apostle? Huh?

01:10:22.676 --> 01:10:23.844
Otunba, sir?

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:29.391
You? But she wants to come back here
and share from our hustle again,

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.895
She wants to be king at this table,

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:38.525
[in Yoruba] Mama, your era has passed,
Drop the mantle,

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:40.444
[in English] Release the crown,

01:10:51.872 --> 01:10:53.457
Jesus of Nazareth!

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:57.378
Apostle, that is not from Jesus,,,

01:10:59.129 --> 01:11:00.172
or your king,

01:11:01.715 --> 01:11:02.800
It's from Makanaki,

01:11:02.883 --> 01:11:04.677
And Odogwu Malay,

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:07.763
-Tell them the facts,
-Facts,

01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:12.518
Well,,, [clears throat]
Um, what is done is done,

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.604
Mummy, we cannot reverse
what has been done,

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:20.401
But I'm glad
that Makanaki respects our rules

01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:24.238
enough to make sure
the king has her share,

01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:30.536
No, no, Everybody at this table
has an equal share, Who's a king?

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:34.832
Maki! Her cut is 40,
after everything else,

01:11:34.915 --> 01:11:36.667
[in Yoruba]
She's not my king,

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:37.876
[in English]
She's not my king,

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.421
[Eniola laughs]

01:11:40.504 --> 01:11:43.048
[in Yoruba] They say a child
doesn't recognize a deadly herb,

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.758
so he calls it a vegetable

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.220
The elders spoke that proverb,

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:54.059
Little ones, where were you
when I started?

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.312
Look at me, Akorede,

01:11:57.229 --> 01:12:00.441
[in English] Sitting in this chair
as the head of this table,,,

01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:02.026
It's not by mistake,

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:07.364
Your weak, late uncle,

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.826
who you inherited that seat from
should have told you,

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:14.413
No worries,

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:17.207
[in Yoruba] The whip that was used
for the first wife

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.375
is available for the second wife,

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:21.462
It seems that that crown on your head
is starting to drive you crazy,

01:12:21.545 --> 01:12:23.464
Makanaki, is something wrong with you?

01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:25.174
[in English]
What sort of insult is that?

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:29.011
If you cannot respect the crown,
respect her age,

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.515
[in Pidgin]
Your blood's too hot, Calm down,

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:38.020
Yorubas say:

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:40.147
[in Yoruba]
"May God deliver us from evil,"

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:43.108
You thought that prayer
was about sickness?

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.986
Disease? Or death?

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:54.703
That prayer was about me,

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:58.540
I am evil incarnate,

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:03.212
God's worst punishment in a person!

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:06.799
-And when I rain,,,
-No, no, no, Eniola, no!

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:10.677
[in Yoruba] They say,
one's child cannot be so bad

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.097
that he is offered to the Lion as food,

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:15.808
And? You think am afraid of God?

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.143
[in Pidgin] Keep quiet,

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:21.063
Why do you talk like this?
You don't fear God?

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:24.900
Don't you know that God sees everything
that's happening here? You will upset Him,

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:28.904
Only God can settle
all these problems going on here,

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:30.781
What is wrong with you?

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.741
That is the problem,

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:35.536
Any small thing: "God, God, God,"

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:37.871
You are all afraid of a God
you have never seen,

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:41.375
[in Pidgin] You really should fear me
as I sit here, but you don't,

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.586
Hmm?

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.673
[in Yoruba]
If only you could see inside me,

01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:50.259
you would know how dark my heart is,

01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:52.094
-Akorede,
-Hmm?

01:13:53.011 --> 01:13:54.847
-You want my crown?
-Yes,

01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:59.226
Stand up, Come and collect it,

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:03.522
[in Yoruba] You'll realize that the teeth
a dog uses to play with her puppies

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.023
are the same teeth
she uses to discipline them,

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:10.571
Mama, you like to speak in parables?
Let me give you one,

01:14:12.072 --> 01:14:15.993
[in Yoruba] A tree that cannot
support us when we rest on it

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:17.911
cannot kill us if it falls on us,

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:22.791
Korede, stop there!

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:24.626
Look at me,

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:29.214
[in English] I swear,
in front of everybody here today,

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.884
including the man of God,,,

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:37.139
that I, Eniola Salami,

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:40.476
will stretch my hands over your dead body,

01:14:41.059 --> 01:14:44.813
[in Yoruba]
It's Makanaki! My name is Makanaki,

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:55.115
-Mr, Apata,
-Mr, Gobir,

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.700
Yes, good day,

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.496
Yes, any new offers on the house yet?

01:15:01.079 --> 01:15:03.207
Mr, Gobir, these things
don't happen overnight,

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.418
You gave us strict instructions,

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:09.880
unless you'd like us to entertain offers
below your asking price,

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.050
[sighs]

01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:16.428
That's okay,

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:21.308
Give it some more time,
Mr, Apata, I'll call you back,

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:25.938
Hi,

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:35.030
It's okay, they are fine,

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:39.326
They are with my sister,

You accepted the sacrifice of Aresha
and he also became successful,

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.299
You are the one that accepted
the sacrifice of Onikoyi,

01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:39.386

You have no understanding!
You have no understanding, Akorede!

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:08.498
It is said that the flood is always
determined to wash away the house,

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:11.084
but the owner must be ready to prevent it,
That is so!

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:15.422
A dog that challenges a lion
is definitely ready to die,

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:19.509
That is so!

01:17:21.094 --> 01:17:23.639
A butterfly

will surely have wings

Open your mouth and say exactly
what you want here today,

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.314
The crown is the identity of a king,

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.067
Beads are the identity of a chief,

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.654

Very, But nothing
has been able to stick until now,

Look, she's been laundering a lot of money
through these businesses,

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.832
We received a reliable tip

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.960
that she is the mastermind

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:03.089
behind the string
of recent political robberies,

01:20:03.548 --> 01:20:07.219
Her targets can't go
to the police and report

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:10.889
because these are stolen funds,

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:14.476
So she is making out like a bandit,

01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:23.819

Aren't they her political cronies?

-"Child, don't kill me,"
-Mummy,

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:46.127
-Do your job! Do your job,
-Do my job?

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.505
-[in Yoruba] That's enough,
-You know what? I blame you,

01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:51.967
-Me?
-You baby him and you spoil him

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.594
and that's why he walks around
with this stupid sense of entitlement!

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:55.679
That's enough, please,

01:22:55.762 --> 01:22:57.514
-Entitlement?
-Yes!

01:22:57.597 --> 01:22:59.933
If anybody should be entitled here,,,

01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:01.851
-Stop!
-,,,who should be entitled? You,

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:04.020
-Kitan!
-At least I am not actively trying

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:05.855
to bring shame onto this family!

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:09.859
Kemi, That's enough, please,

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:15.949
I am tired of letting him get away
with everything because "KT is sensitive,"

01:23:16.032 --> 01:23:17.117
Don't say that,

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.161
He does absolutely nothing
but spend money all day!

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:22.038
Adds nothing to this family!

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.290
And after almost ruining
his life in England,

01:23:24.374 --> 01:23:26.626
he comes back here to pick up
where he left off!

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:28.545
-He'll never change!
-That's enough!

01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:32.841
Mummy, I'm doing my best to be calm,
Am I not your son?

01:23:32.924 --> 01:23:35.135
Should she be talking to me like this?
Am I not your son? That's enough!

01:23:35.218 --> 01:23:38.138
-Wait,
-Son? Kitan,,,

01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:41.891
I am more of a son than you will ever be,

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.476
-Don't say that!
-What do you want to do?

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.561
-Stop!
-What?

01:23:44.644 --> 01:23:47.772
[in Yoruba] Don't ever say that!
It's enough! Don't ever say that!

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.150
What is the matter with you?
Don't ever repeat that in this house!

01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:51.609
-I blame you,
-Blame me for what?

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.194
-I blame you,
-You cannot blame me!

01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.364
You are to blame for everything,
You treat him like a two-year-old,

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.329
[church bells ringing,
organ music playing]

01:24:58.009 --> 01:24:59.052
Alhaja,,,

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:04.516
Look, I remember how you helped my son

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:07.560
with that unfortunate incident,

01:25:08.311 --> 01:25:11.397
so I agreed to this meeting
out of respect,

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:15.193
But honestly, I do not know
how I can be of help,

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.444
That's the problem,

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:21.116
Because everyone seems to have forgotten
all the good things I have done for them,

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:26.371
See, that is the kind of talk that has
landed you where you are now, Eniola,

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:29.958
What kind of talk, Senator Okon?
What kind of talk?

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:34.587
Huh? Because I insisted on
what was promised to me?

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:35.755
[Okon] Yes,

01:25:37.423 --> 01:25:41.845
See, I don't know how this works
where you come from,

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:46.558
But, Eniola, you have played politics
long enough to know

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.893
that there are no certainties
in this game,

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:53.106
And these threats and raids--

01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:58.069
I had nothing to do with this,
Absolutely nothing,

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:02.574
As far as everyone is concerned,
you have drawn the battle line,

01:26:03.449 --> 01:26:05.869
You have made yourself a liability,

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:08.037
A dangerous one,

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:10.915
Number One is far from happy,

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:13.585
I tried calling him,

01:26:14.919 --> 01:26:18.089
I tried calling him
to explain things to him,

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:21.634
He is not taking my calls,
Nobody is taking my calls,

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:26.347
Everyone shut me out completely,
despite everything I've done for them,

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:30.310
Of course! You have stepped
on the tail of the tiger,

01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:33.188
And I'm afraid what he might do,

01:26:50.079 --> 01:26:51.289
I need to see him,

01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:56.294
Can you arrange a meeting?

01:26:57.545 --> 01:27:01.591
Eniola, I could be in trouble
just being seen with you,

01:27:02.425 --> 01:27:04.510
Not to mention telling you all this,

01:27:06.429 --> 01:27:07.513
I have to go,

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.308
Good luck,

01:27:30.119 --> 01:27:32.121
[sirens wailing]

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.009
Where are they?

01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:47.262
Open the gate for them!

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:50.473
Come on, open the gate!
We have nothing to hide!

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.029
-Good morning, madam,
-Yes?

01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:09.742
I can't read it,

01:28:11.494 --> 01:28:13.454
It's an official letter
inviting you in, ma,

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:16.291
[chuckling] Inviting me? What's going on?
You're throwing a party?

01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:18.126
-For questioning, madam,
-Today?

01:28:18.209 --> 01:28:19.210
Right now,

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:20.670
Questioning for what?

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.047
You will find out
when you get to the office,

01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:26.801
Don't worry,

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:29.304
Give me few minutes to change
and I'll be with you,

01:28:29.595 --> 01:28:32.140
-That's fine,
-Just stay there please, There,

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.186
Mum, let's just go, please,
You want to change, let's change,

01:28:40.023 --> 01:28:43.860
[Gobir] Good morning, Mrs, Salami,
Pleasure to finally meet you,

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:46.154
The pleasure is all mine,

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.824
My daughter,

01:28:49.907 --> 01:28:52.618
Kemi Salami,
I'll be acting as her legal counsel,

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:55.997
Congratulations on your new appointment,

01:28:57.582 --> 01:29:01.294
Although the man before you
happens to be my very good friend,

01:29:03.379 --> 01:29:06.591
I'm sure you are going to do great
in this new appointment of yours,

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:09.552
Of course, Mrs, Salami, Thank you,

01:29:09.635 --> 01:29:10.845
You're welcome,

01:29:10.928 --> 01:29:13.848
Well, I would not like to insult you
by beating around the bush,

01:29:13.931 --> 01:29:15.683
Do you mind
if we go straight to the point?

01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:17.643
-Oh, please,
-Great,

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:25.360
Well, first of all I must thank you
for coming on such short notice,

01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:26.819
Well, she didn't have a choice,

01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:29.447
Your men barricaded our house
like she was a criminal,

01:29:29.947 --> 01:29:31.032
Sorry to hear that,

01:29:31.115 --> 01:29:34.619
I must speak to my people
on better procedure next time,

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:41.834
Mr, Gobir, you invited me, and here I am,

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:43.628
I have nothing to hide,

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:49.008
Well, we are working on a tip
from a very reliable source,

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:51.427
that you are involved in, uh,,,

01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:57.683
Yes, Money laundering,
drug and weapon smuggling,

01:29:57.767 --> 01:30:00.436
Surely, you did not bring
my mother here on hearsay,

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:03.648
And who is this "reliable source"
feeding you these tips?

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:09.112
Ms, Salami, with all due respect,
you know I cannot tell you that,

01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:11.155
Well, those tips are simply unfounded,

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.824
My mother is a very hardworking woman

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:15.493
with multiple legitimate businesses
to her name,

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:18.454
Does she look like someone
that smuggles drugs or weapons?

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.040
Thank you for bringing that up

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:23.459
That's actually
why we invited you all here,

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:30.007
You see, our investigation uncovered that
you use these businesses to launder money,

01:30:30.466 --> 01:30:36.389
And we also uncovered that you have
multiple high-end properties

01:30:36.472 --> 01:30:42.186
under the name of,,, Kachi Nwachukwu,

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.606
who, until recently,
was your domestic help,

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:49.986
-[chuckles]
-Ma'am, I'm not sure how well you pay,

01:30:50.069 --> 01:30:54.490
but with two high rises
in Ikoyi and one in VI,,,

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:57.076
And then, you have to explain
the source of all that money

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.036
scattered in your bank accounts,

01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:03.666
I'm not sure that would be gotten
from the sale of lace and bread?

01:31:03.749 --> 01:31:04.917
I beg your pardon?

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:08.171
No, I'm saying she doesn't
pay enough tax for that to be so,

01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:11.090
Wait, you have her account information?

01:31:11.757 --> 01:31:14.844
Surely that's gross infringement
of privacy, at least,

01:31:15.678 --> 01:31:19.348
Ms, Salami, I assure you
we have legal jurisdiction,

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:23.603
You are allowed to be in this meeting
simply out of courtesy,

01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:29.025
Your mother here does not need a lawyer,
neither does she need a mouthpiece,

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:33.988
It's just a simple questioning,
I mean, it's just a mere conversation,

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:38.284
So, I'll suggest that you allow her
to speak for herself,

01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:41.454
That's all right,

01:31:41.537 --> 01:31:47.335
As she said, I have loads of businesses,

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:51.756
A few fabric shops,

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:59.680
bakeries where I make my sweet,
beautiful Agege bread

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:05.228
two water bottling companies, other--

01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:09.232
And if you gave us time,
we would have brought

01:32:09.315 --> 01:32:12.985
the necessary documents needed
to answer your questions in this regard,

01:32:13.277 --> 01:32:14.654
As for the properties owned by Kachi,

01:32:14.737 --> 01:32:18.241
she's worked with my mother
since I was, what-- six years old?

01:32:18.658 --> 01:32:23.037
-But we haven't seen her in,,, two years?
-Yeah, two years,

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.081
Two years,

01:32:25.164 --> 01:32:28.417
So unless you can
tie us to these buildings,

01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:33.547
I find this course of questioning
disrespectful and completely out of order,

01:32:45.142 --> 01:32:47.645
[static]

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:50.856
[in Pidgin] Guy, why did you get a car
with a broken radio?

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.317
Turn down the volume, Turn it down,

01:33:39.238 --> 01:33:40.448
Call Tiger now,

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:50.833
-His phone is switched off,
-Call him again, Call him again, fast,

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:55.588
-Mr, Gobir?
-Yes,

01:33:55.671 --> 01:33:57.465
You didn't have to walk me out, you know,

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:58.966
It's my pleasure,

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:01.761
-Please,
-Oh, thank you,

01:34:12.521 --> 01:34:17.360
Needless to say, you must let us know
before any international travel,

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:23.032
[laughs] Like I said earlier, I have
nothing to hide, so I'm not running,

01:34:23.949 --> 01:34:26.202
Thank you once again
and have a lovely evening,

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.385
[Tiger] Hello?

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:45.513
-Hmm,
-Mom, are you okay?

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:50.267
King, Musa and Tango
have got the package cornered,

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.977
Should they take it out?

01:34:58.943 --> 01:34:59.985
Stop,

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.366
[sighs] The ground is very, very hot,

01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:11.080
It's because of Gobir's interference,

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:16.752
-Ade, Tiger,
-Yes, ma,

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.046
Keep eyes on him for now,

01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:23.300
Boys, stand down,

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:26.971
Yes, boss, Yeah, Okay,

01:35:41.944 --> 01:35:43.779
-Kemi,
-Mum,

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:51.787
Get a gift to Mr, Gobir
to apologize for his inconvenience,

01:35:52.705 --> 01:35:54.874
How much of an inconvenience
are we talking?

01:35:54.957 --> 01:35:56.000
[chuckles]

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.588
A very big inconvenience,

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:09.597
Yeah, it's me, I need you
to handle something for me immediately,

01:36:20.316 --> 01:36:21.567
[sighs]

01:36:27.823 --> 01:36:28.824
[yawns]

01:37:03.943 --> 01:37:06.779
[in Hausa]
Lord have mercy!

01:37:30.427 --> 01:37:32.638
[phone ringing]

01:37:59.081 --> 01:38:00.165
Hello?

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:02.626
[distorted voice] I see you got our gift,

01:38:06.505 --> 01:38:07.673
Who is this?

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:12.219
It's a hand of friendship
from Alhaja Salami,

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.768
What if I refuse the gift?

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:21.729
Trust me, sir,

01:38:22.646 --> 01:38:25.899
You would rather be friends
with the Alhaja than her enemy,

01:38:26.984 --> 01:38:28.110
Is that a threat?

01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:34.867
Ah, Mr, Gobir, When did $500,000
in cash become a threat?

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:25.542
I'm going to die, aren't I?

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.086
Don't say that!

01:39:28.545 --> 01:39:33.467
[in Hausa] Don't talk like this, Hauwa,
That will never happen, God forbid,

01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:37.346
Come, God forbid, Come, Come,

01:39:37.429 --> 01:39:38.681
[woman crying]

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:50.693
[news jingle]

01:39:50.776 --> 01:39:52.861
[news anchor] Good evening,
I am Sade Bello,

01:39:52.945 --> 01:39:55.447
-[sirens blaring]
-KAVTV can now confirm

01:39:55.531 --> 01:39:59.993
that political ally and socialite
Alhaja Eniola Salami

01:40:00.077 --> 01:40:03.580
has been arrested this evening
by state officials

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:06.709
on suspicion of murder, money laundering,

01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:10.462
diversion of state funds,
bribing a state agent,

01:40:10.546 --> 01:40:13.382
It has been confirmed
that she has been taken into custody

01:40:13.465 --> 01:40:15.718
to an undisclosed location,

01:40:18.762 --> 01:40:20.764
I demand to be let in to see my mother,

01:40:21.473 --> 01:40:23.809
Madam, you cannot demand anything here,

01:40:23.892 --> 01:40:24.977
I'm her lawyer,

01:40:25.644 --> 01:40:28.856
Madam, you cannot see her now,
She is going through booking and--

01:40:28.939 --> 01:40:31.775
What? So, you intend
to keep her here overnight?

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:33.610
-Madam,
-[Gobir] Ms, Salami,

01:40:34.653 --> 01:40:36.405
-Sir!
-You see, there is no need

01:40:36.488 --> 01:40:37.948
to get overexcited,

01:40:38.615 --> 01:40:41.869
You will see your mum
as soon as she is booked and processed,

01:40:41.952 --> 01:40:43.954
So you are keeping her here overnight?

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:47.624
Yes, hopefully,
And every other night until trial,

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:48.876
On what charges?

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:53.922
Okay, There you go,

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:04.725
[scoffs] You can't prove any of this,

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:07.728
[whispers] Can I have this, please?

01:41:21.992 --> 01:41:23.118
Shit,

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:25.078
[grunts]

01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:30.834
Ah, ah,

01:41:31.293 --> 01:41:34.129
[in Yoruba] Eni, you will hurt me,

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.684
Good girl,

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:53.982
Why would I be dealing with a bloody
servant when he has a king?

01:41:54.066 --> 01:41:56.318
Ah, [laughs]

01:41:57.528 --> 01:41:59.780
-I salute you, boss,
-Yes, yes?

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.616
-We have a small big problem,
-What are you saying?

01:42:06.411 --> 01:42:08.789
Alhaji, I'll be on my way,

01:42:10.207 --> 01:42:14.169
Say what you have to say
and stop bothering me, Can't you see I'm--

01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:16.296
Alaaru was arrested
just before he boarded the plane,

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:20.425
How? But we have people in there,

01:42:20.509 --> 01:42:22.302
Someone snitched on him,

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:24.471
Have you reached out
to our people in there

01:42:24.555 --> 01:42:26.515
to see if there is anything they can do?

01:42:26.598 --> 01:42:29.184
It's too late, He has been detained,

01:42:29.601 --> 01:42:31.854
-Has he mentioned my name?
-Not yet, sir,

01:42:31.937 --> 01:42:33.021
Hurry up!

01:42:33.105 --> 01:42:36.900
Reach out to our people on the inside
so they can handle the situation,

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:39.528
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir,

01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:40.904
You understand?

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:43.156
Go and do something about it!

01:42:44.867 --> 01:42:49.580
But if we don't deliver
the package tonight, sir,

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:51.373
we will lose our contact in London,

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:53.667
Ah, that's a problem,

01:42:55.878 --> 01:42:58.171
That's a problem,

01:42:58.255 --> 01:43:01.008
Don't worry about that,
I will take it for you,

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:06.889
I said I'll take it for you,

01:43:13.228 --> 01:43:18.066
My love, let me do this for you,
I can carry it for you, You can trust me,

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:28.535
[Kemi] Mummy, Mummy,

01:43:38.211 --> 01:43:40.589
I was told I could confer with my client,

01:43:43.967 --> 01:43:44.968
Alone!

01:43:46.094 --> 01:43:47.387
[guard] Ten minutes,

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:57.022
Mummy, are they treating you well?

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:04.112
Kemi, they are closing in on me,
All of them,

01:44:06.281 --> 01:44:07.741
[in Yoruba]
They can smell blood,

01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:12.871
They want to get me,

01:44:12.955 --> 01:44:14.373
Mummy, don't talk like that,

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:22.130
You can't let them see you like this,
Defeated,

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.176
You are King,

01:44:27.302 --> 01:44:29.012
The King,

01:44:32.724 --> 01:44:34.184
Get me out,

01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:37.646
I will, I'll get you out,

01:44:38.355 --> 01:44:40.983
Don't cry, Don't let them see you cry,

01:44:41.066 --> 01:44:43.026
[sobbing]

01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:53.412
[phone rings]

01:44:57.249 --> 01:44:58.625
Hello, sir,

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:02.754
[man] Gobir, well done,
The entire department is so proud of you,

01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:04.047
Thank you, sir,

01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:06.299
Make sure that woman
doesn't get bail, though,

01:45:07.092 --> 01:45:08.802
Of course, sir, I'm on it, sir,

01:45:08.885 --> 01:45:10.887
And also make sure your case is airtight

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:14.850
because that woman is as slippery
as an eel, and extremely dangerous,

01:45:14.933 --> 01:45:16.435
Yes, sir, Sure,

01:45:16.935 --> 01:45:19.104
Good, Uh, Gobir?

01:45:19.187 --> 01:45:20.272
Yes, sir?

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:24.026
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:27.779
[in Yoruba]
Yes, go ahead, sir,

01:45:28.697 --> 01:45:30.198
The money,

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:33.577
I mean, weren't you even tempted at all?

01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:38.915
Of course I was, sir,

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:44.504
[in Yoruba] But if I had taken it,
I would have become one of them,

01:45:45.255 --> 01:45:47.966
And that is something my conscience
cannot live with,

01:45:48.967 --> 01:45:52.763
I have even more respect for you now,
Thank you very much, Gobir,

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:54.806
-Bye,
-Thank you, sir,

01:46:05.275 --> 01:46:08.361
-[laughing]
- [in Yoruba] Me? With which guy?

01:46:08.445 --> 01:46:11.156
That guy that walks around
running his mouth,

01:46:11.239 --> 01:46:14.367
I was just staring at him,
wondering if he was talking to me,

01:46:14.451 --> 01:46:16.119
Lord have mercy,

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.956
Eni-Baby,

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.044
You intoxicate me
like alcohol all the time,

01:46:24.127 --> 01:46:26.213
I wish I met you when I was young,

01:46:26.963 --> 01:46:30.509
-You would have recognized!
-Alhaji, you still have it now,

01:46:30.592 --> 01:46:33.345
That's not true,
There's a huge difference,

01:46:33.428 --> 01:46:36.598
You would have enjoyed me
the way the white man enjoys cigars,

01:46:36.681 --> 01:46:39.434
That would have been too much,

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:46.566
My good lover,
My sweet lover, My darling lover,

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:49.111
Eni, Eni,

01:46:51.113 --> 01:46:54.157
You make me happy all the time,

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:59.037
But I've asked you to marry me
and you have refused,

01:46:59.121 --> 01:47:00.622
What is wrong? Marry me,

01:47:03.792 --> 01:47:09.172
Eni, listen, Why do you keep
punishing me like this all the time?

01:47:14.386 --> 01:47:18.056
I am asking you to marry me,
What is wrong with you? Eni,

01:47:21.852 --> 01:47:24.229
Don't you already have a wife?
Yes or no?

01:47:24.312 --> 01:47:26.523
So? What does that
have to do with anything?

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:30.527
Look, I can marry up to four wives,

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:33.405
Oh, so you want to marry four wives?

01:47:33.488 --> 01:47:36.116
-No,
-That's what you're saying,

01:47:36.199 --> 01:47:39.244
Don't misunderstand me, young lady,

01:47:39.327 --> 01:47:43.206
Look, I want you, It's you I want,

01:47:43.707 --> 01:47:45.625
Eni, Eni,

01:47:47.752 --> 01:47:48.753
Alhaji,

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:55.093
You know I would do
anything for you in this life,

01:47:55.177 --> 01:47:58.555
Any bloody thing, I would do it,

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:00.348
But me?

01:48:00.432 --> 01:48:06.521
I will never be a second wife,

01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:10.066
Eni, Eni!

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:12.694
What's wrong with this girl?

01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:23.288
[clicks tongue] I don't know why
she's not picking up her calls,

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:26.583
Must be the network,
Would you like to try my number?

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:27.709
Yeah,

01:48:29.878 --> 01:48:30.879
Code,

01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:33.965
Tiger, please give me 15 minutes,
I'll be right down,

01:48:34.382 --> 01:48:35.550
Where have you been?

01:48:36.384 --> 01:48:39.346
Why haven't you been picking up my calls?
I've been trying to reach you all day,

01:48:39.429 --> 01:48:41.556
Kitan, not now please, I'm exhausted,

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:44.643
I've been at the holding cell
all day trying to make bail,

01:48:44.726 --> 01:48:45.936
[Kitan] When is she coming out?

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:49.522
I'm doing everything I can,
but they're intent on keeping her,

01:48:49.606 --> 01:48:51.816
I mean they don't even
want to discuss bail

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:54.110
and all our political contacts
are distancing,,,

01:48:56.363 --> 01:49:01.159
Hello, You must be so tired,
Is there anything I can do to help?

01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:03.245
[Kitan] This is my girlfriend, Amaka,

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:06.331
Amaka, Kemi, My,,,

01:49:07.082 --> 01:49:08.625
The one I told you about,

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:09.918
Oh, hi!

01:49:11.002 --> 01:49:12.754
Amaka is a lawyer as well,

01:49:12.837 --> 01:49:16.633
So, I have been trying to get her
up to speed on everything that's going on,

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:19.594
So, what I want you guys to do
is sit down and strategize,

01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:22.305
so we can try to come up
with a solution to this whole thing,

01:49:22.806 --> 01:49:23.807
All right?

01:49:24.599 --> 01:49:25.767
[indistinct]

01:49:27.978 --> 01:49:29.104
[scoffs]

01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:35.819
[Kemi] So what you are telling me
is that,,,

01:49:36.945 --> 01:49:38.238
Wait, Kitan,

01:49:38.321 --> 01:49:44.744
So, you discussed private family business
with an outsider, huh?

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:46.663
Kitan,,,

01:49:48.206 --> 01:49:53.920
if you think for a second that
I'm going to sit down and talk strategy

01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:55.005
with one of your whores--

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:57.173
Hey, there's no need for all that,

01:49:57.257 --> 01:50:00.302
You're even more clueless
than I've given you credit for,

01:50:00.385 --> 01:50:01.594
[Amaka] My darling,,,

01:50:02.595 --> 01:50:04.139
You know what, I think I should go,

01:50:04.222 --> 01:50:07.017
No, This is my mother's house,

01:50:07.809 --> 01:50:09.477
If anyone is going to leave,
she is welcome to,

01:50:11.688 --> 01:50:12.897
[sighs]

01:50:17.193 --> 01:50:19.612
What's all this attitude?
Is it not you I'm talking to?

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:24.743
-Kemi,
-Kitan, babe, Babe, calm down,

01:50:24.826 --> 01:50:27.203
-This is the rubbish I have to deal,
-[Amaka] I know,

01:50:29.247 --> 01:50:31.583
-[in Yoruba] Good afternoon,
-Welcome,

01:50:31.666 --> 01:50:34.336
-Is this Kemi?
-Yes, it's her,

01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:36.421
She's all grown up,

01:50:36.504 --> 01:50:37.881
Kem-Kem,

01:50:42.385 --> 01:50:45.805
Bunmi,,, Bunmi,

01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:57.192
-Bunmi,
-[in Yoruba] Oh, Eni-Baby, You came,

01:50:57.275 --> 01:50:59.527
Of course,

01:50:59.611 --> 01:51:02.030
I dashed here as soon as I heard,

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:05.992
It's been a long time,

01:51:08.453 --> 01:51:10.622
[Bunmi] You look so good,

01:51:12.624 --> 01:51:13.792
[coughs]

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:20.757
I'm so glad you got
out of that place early,

01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:25.595
I can see that life has been
kinder to you,

01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:31.726
-Look at my Eni-Baby,
-How are you?

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:34.312
How are you doing?

01:51:39.317 --> 01:51:44.572
Sometimes bad,

01:51:44.656 --> 01:51:48.785
sometimes worse,

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:56.376
Today is bad, So I thank God,

01:51:57.001 --> 01:52:02.632
Look, See, I am going to take you
to a hospital that is very, very good,

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:05.552
[in Yoruba] A hospital
where they know what they're doing,

01:52:05.635 --> 01:52:08.388
Do you understand? Don't worry,

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:11.850
I just need one favor from you,

01:52:11.933 --> 01:52:13.435
Name anything,

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:22.277
No, No,

01:52:24.195 --> 01:52:28.950
Look, you're going to get better
and take care of your child by yourself,

01:52:29.033 --> 01:52:31.661
[in Yoruba] You hear me?
By the grace of God,

01:52:31.744 --> 01:52:35.415
you will get better
and you will take care of her by yourself,

01:52:35.957 --> 01:52:37.625
That's exactly what will happen,

01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:40.003
No, I will not,

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:48.803
It's already too late,
There is no cure for this thing,

01:52:48.887 --> 01:52:50.555
Don't talk like that,

01:52:51.181 --> 01:52:52.724
[in Yoruba] What do these people know?

01:52:52.807 --> 01:52:55.310
They don't know anything,
What do they know?

01:52:55.393 --> 01:52:57.312
All they are looking for is money,

01:52:57.395 --> 01:52:58.897
Let me tell you something,

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:02.108
Chief knows every doctor,
There is no doctor,,,

01:53:02.192 --> 01:53:04.903
[in Yoruba] Look, we will fly them in,

01:53:04.986 --> 01:53:07.030
We will fly them in,
Do you understand?

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:10.325
I just want you
to take care of Kemi for me,

01:53:11.701 --> 01:53:15.079
There is no other person on this earth
I can trust more,

01:53:17.874 --> 01:53:20.793
I don't want her to grow up
in my environment,

01:53:22.086 --> 01:53:24.088
That dirty world we grew up in,

01:53:24.172 --> 01:53:28.510
Please help me give her a better life,

01:53:31.095 --> 01:53:34.974
A life I can never give her,
but you now can,

01:53:38.603 --> 01:53:40.188
I promise,

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:45.818
I promise,

01:54:00.375 --> 01:54:01.626
Tiger,

01:54:03.628 --> 01:54:07.882
I need you to do something
very important for me,

01:54:11.719 --> 01:54:13.471
-[knocking at door]
-Come in,

01:54:15.723 --> 01:54:17.642
[woman] Just wanted to make sure
you were ready, sir,

01:54:17.725 --> 01:54:20.979
Yes, I am,
Do you have all the files with you?

01:54:21.062 --> 01:54:22.188
They are right here with me, sir,

01:54:22.272 --> 01:54:24.691
-Oh, good, So let's go then,
-All right, sir,

01:54:24.774 --> 01:54:26.901
[phone vibrates]

01:54:30.029 --> 01:54:31.781
-I'll meet you downstairs,
-All right, sir,

01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.450
Look, honey,
I really don't have the time to talk now,

01:54:34.534 --> 01:54:36.035
I'm on the way to the court,

01:54:36.119 --> 01:54:38.413
[man] That's exactly why we must talk now,

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:43.126
Who is this and what are doing
with my wife's phone?

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:44.961
-[crying]
-You, talk to your husband,

01:54:46.379 --> 01:54:49.007
Honey, please help us,

01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:51.009
-Do whatever they tell you,
-[men shouting]

01:54:51.676 --> 01:54:54.470
Please, That's my entire family, Please,

01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:57.682
Don't hurt any one of them,

01:54:57.765 --> 01:54:59.142
I don't want to,

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:04.397
But if you don't want me to send you
their body parts one after the other,

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:06.232
you must do something for me,

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:10.361
[bailiff] May we all rise for
The Honorable Justice Nwachukwu,

01:55:14.490 --> 01:55:15.617
Please be seated,

01:55:19.329 --> 01:55:21.497
I'll go right to it,

01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:27.629
After deliberating on the evidence
presented to this court,

01:55:28.922 --> 01:55:35.345
I feel the NCCC has failed
to establish a direct link

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:41.643
between Alhaja Salami
and the $500,000 bribe,

01:55:43.269 --> 01:55:46.147
All other evidence
is circumstantial at best,

01:55:47.065 --> 01:55:51.903
Not forgetting that Alhaja Salami
is a respected member of society

01:55:52.612 --> 01:55:55.573
with strong ties with the community,

01:55:58.618 --> 01:56:03.331
With all these in mind,
I have no other choice

01:56:04.415 --> 01:56:10.171
than to grant Alhaja Salami

01:56:12.423 --> 01:56:14.884
bail without conditions,

01:56:14.968 --> 01:56:17.971
[crowd clamoring]

01:56:18.054 --> 01:56:20.765
-[gavel banging]
-Silence in court!

01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:24.477
-[gavel banging]
-Silence in court!

01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:26.562
[clamoring continues]

01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:32.443
[reporters clamoring]

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:41.035
Calm down, Calm down,
Calm down, Calm down,

01:56:42.245 --> 01:56:43.788
Loosely borrowing from the words

01:56:43.871 --> 01:56:46.290
of the very well-respected
Justice Nwachukwu,

01:56:46.374 --> 01:56:49.419
my mother is
an upstanding member of this community,

01:56:49.502 --> 01:56:51.504
[clamoring continues]

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:57.260
And it is completely outrageous
how she is being treated,

01:56:59.846 --> 01:57:04.475
We caution the NCCC
to cease this witch-hunt of Alhaja Salami,

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.982
Or we will have no other recourse
than to seek redress in the court of law,

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:14.652
Hold on,

01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:19.407
As you can tell, my mother is very tired,
So no more questions,

01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:22.243
but you can expect a formal statement
from us soon, Thank you,

01:57:22.326 --> 01:57:24.328
[clamoring]

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:35.923
[gun cocks]

01:57:38.301 --> 01:57:40.053
[gunshot, screaming]

01:57:56.611 --> 01:57:58.613
[no audible dialogue]

01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:30.705
Oh,,,

01:59:37.753 --> 01:59:41.132
[in Yoruba]
How is everything now?

01:59:41.215 --> 01:59:46.012
Oh, I don't want to hear
any business talk from you,

01:59:46.804 --> 01:59:48.306
No business talk,

01:59:49.473 --> 01:59:52.768
Everything you're supposed to be doing,
I'm handling it,

01:59:52.852 --> 01:59:56.063
So don't worry about it,
Our business is doing very fine,

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:01.068
That shouldn't be your burden to bear,

02:00:01.152 --> 02:00:05.615
You shouldn't be doing any work
in this your condition,

02:00:08.117 --> 02:00:10.119
I am not having any condition,

02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:14.624
I am having your son,
You say I am having "condition,"

02:00:15.249 --> 02:00:17.418
Besides, it's only till you get well,

02:00:19.962 --> 02:00:23.966
I don't know if that will ever happen,

02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:27.511
[in Yoruba]
God forbid!

02:00:27.595 --> 02:00:29.680
By the grace of God, you are already well,

02:00:29.764 --> 02:00:32.683
Look, in the name of Jesus,,,

02:00:32.767 --> 02:00:37.605
As long as the Almighty Father that
I serve is alive, you are already well,

02:00:37.688 --> 02:00:41.359
Look, you are already well,
but you just don't know it yet,

02:00:41.442 --> 02:00:44.695
I'll be mad at you, Don't ever say that,

02:00:47.073 --> 02:00:48.950
Eni,

02:00:50.493 --> 02:00:55.748
I don't know how much time I still have,

02:00:57.208 --> 02:01:03.047
And I want to see my family,

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:10.596
[in Yoruba]
For God's sake, please,

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:13.474
Please, let me see them, Please,

02:01:14.475 --> 02:01:16.477
[in Yoruba]
For God's sake,

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:24.110
Alhaji, something has happened,

02:01:31.325 --> 02:01:33.869
There was a very bad accident,

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:40.084
And in that car crash,
not a single soul survived,

02:01:40.167 --> 02:01:41.794
Eh?

02:01:41.877 --> 02:01:44.338
I didn't know how to tell you,
That was why I kept quiet about it,

02:01:44.422 --> 02:01:49.176
Because, how do I even say
that type of a thing?

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:50.344
Eni!

02:01:53.848 --> 02:01:55.808
Ah, Eni,

02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:07.528
Now that we have joined you both in holy
matrimony according to Islamic rites,

02:02:07.611 --> 02:02:11.949
and as the holy prophet
Muhammad has instructed,

02:02:12.033 --> 02:02:14.493
we will round this off
with the Fatiha prayer,

02:02:14.577 --> 02:02:17.663
[praying in Arabic]

02:02:23.919 --> 02:02:27.631
[praying continues]

02:02:38.768 --> 02:02:40.186
-[women weeping]
-[priest] Father Lord,

02:02:40.269 --> 02:02:42.521
you wept at the death of Lazarus,

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:47.485
Please console those who now
grieve the loss of a loved one,

02:02:48.486 --> 02:02:52.281
Comfort them in the remembrance
of your promises,

02:02:53.449 --> 02:02:57.745
Give those who mourn peace
in the midst of tears and suffering,

02:02:58.329 --> 02:03:00.039
You are the resurrection and the life,

02:03:00.414 --> 02:03:03.667
Let those that despair find hope
and consolation

02:03:03.751 --> 02:03:05.711
in Your presence and Your love,

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:10.424
Oh, Heavenly Father, we pray, Amen,

02:03:11.592 --> 02:03:13.928
[banging on door]

02:03:14.136 --> 02:03:16.305
[woman] I've been trying to-- Kitan,

02:03:16.389 --> 02:03:18.015
Kitan,

02:03:18.099 --> 02:03:20.101
[Kitan sobbing]

02:03:27.024 --> 02:03:28.401
[in Pidgin]
Get this guy out of my sight!

02:03:33.697 --> 02:03:35.324
I should have done this myself!

02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:38.285
So Maka, how will you handle
this Nwachukwu family situation?

02:03:42.706 --> 02:03:44.750
-Cancel them,
-Yes, boss,

02:03:55.553 --> 02:03:56.846
[sighs]

02:03:58.305 --> 02:04:00.099
She died in my hands, Amaka,

02:04:02.184 --> 02:04:03.310
my hands,

02:04:04.812 --> 02:04:09.233
Kitan, you are drunk, And high,

02:04:10.317 --> 02:04:13.112
How do you intend
to take care of your mum like this?

02:04:21.579 --> 02:04:25.207
It will all be okay, I promise,

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:29.420
Look, your mother needs you,

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:33.257
but you cannot go to her
in this condition,

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:37.845
Kitan, you have to be strong,

02:04:39.847 --> 02:04:43.976
This is the time for you to take charge

02:04:44.059 --> 02:04:47.313
and show your mother
you can lead the family,

02:04:48.856 --> 02:04:50.858
[sniffling]

02:04:51.734 --> 02:04:52.985
Have you eaten?

02:04:56.530 --> 02:04:57.948
You need to sober up,

02:04:59.283 --> 02:05:00.784
Let me make you some coffee,

02:05:24.767 --> 02:05:26.769
[phone chiming]

02:05:45.454 --> 02:05:47.456
[beeping]

02:05:51.585 --> 02:05:52.753
Passcode,

02:06:30.666 --> 02:06:32.126
What are you doing?

02:06:35.963 --> 02:06:38.340
-Who's this, Amaka?
-Why are you going through my phone?

02:06:39.717 --> 02:06:42.177
I don't understand, What does this mean?

02:06:43.387 --> 02:06:45.097
You shouldn't have gone through my phone,

02:06:51.061 --> 02:06:52.896
[Kitan] I thought you said you loved me,

02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:56.442
Baby, calm down let me explain,

02:06:57.610 --> 02:07:00.195
-You said you loved me,
-I do,

02:07:01.113 --> 02:07:05.576
You don't understand,
It's not what you think, It was a mistake,

02:07:05.659 --> 02:07:06.994
She was my sister!

02:07:12.916 --> 02:07:15.794
But, Kitan, you hated her,

02:07:27.514 --> 02:07:28.557
[screams]

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:34.980
[gasping, choking]

02:07:39.151 --> 02:07:40.569
[bones cracking]

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:54.541
[Eniola screams]

02:07:54.625 --> 02:07:58.128
In an unbelievable turn
in this ongoing saga,

02:07:58.212 --> 02:08:01.965
KAVTV has just learned that Alhaja Salami

02:08:02.049 --> 02:08:07.012
has lost her only son
to what seems to be a murder-suicide,

02:08:07.096 --> 02:08:08.097
[screams]

02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:12.393
This news just comes one day
after her daughter was gunned down

02:08:12.476 --> 02:08:16.689
outside Justice Nwachukwu's court
by unknown assassins

02:08:16.772 --> 02:08:19.566
seemingly gunning for Alhaja herself,

02:08:19.650 --> 02:08:22.778
Bad news must come in threes
as this comes on the heels

02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:26.740
of NCCC freezing assets
of the business mogul,

02:08:27.241 --> 02:08:31.578
Will this be the end of the Salami empire
as we have come to know it?

02:08:31.662 --> 02:08:33.831
[crying]

02:08:34.665 --> 02:08:38.711
KAVTV has also learned that
the bodies of the wife and children

02:08:38.794 --> 02:08:42.047
of Justice Nwachukwu
were discovered this morning

02:08:42.131 --> 02:08:46.093
on the side of Epe road off Badagry Axis,

02:08:46.176 --> 02:08:48.887
We are told that
there are currently no suspects,

02:08:49.596 --> 02:08:52.766
KAVTV has reached out
to the police for a statement

02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:55.602
but they have declined to comment
at this time,

02:08:55.686 --> 02:08:58.313
as investigations are still ongoing,

02:08:58.397 --> 02:09:00.691
[wailing]

02:09:01.734 --> 02:09:03.736
[screaming]

02:09:11.952 --> 02:09:13.871
[in Yoruba]
Leave me alone!

02:09:21.211 --> 02:09:23.213
[shouting, wailing continues]

02:10:09.635 --> 02:10:12.054
[laughing]

02:10:14.139 --> 02:10:15.766
So that is it, my people,

02:10:16.308 --> 02:10:21.480
We are going to re-strategize,
We are going to,,,

02:10:24.775 --> 02:10:27.069
What sort of madness is this?

02:10:28.237 --> 02:10:30.155
[in Yoruba]
So because of the cat's absence,

02:10:30.239 --> 02:10:33.158
-rats have taken possession of the house,
-What?

02:10:33.242 --> 02:10:35.077
My husband's body
is not even cold in the grave

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:37.788
but you've taken possession
of his seat, isn't it?

02:10:37.871 --> 02:10:39.957
Eniola,

02:10:40.749 --> 02:10:44.628
Look, I know that Alhaji
stupidly accommodated your excesses,

02:10:44.711 --> 02:10:47.339
But I can assure you
that we won't tolerate

02:10:47.422 --> 02:10:48.841
your stepping over your boundaries,

02:10:48.924 --> 02:10:50.342
[in Yoruba]
Never,

02:10:51.385 --> 02:10:52.386
Okay,

02:10:53.262 --> 02:10:58.267
Alhaji Taiwo, you are sitting in my seat,
That is my seat,

02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:59.643
[in Yoruba]
Get up!

02:10:59.726 --> 02:11:01.562
-Abomination!
-Shut your dirty mouth,

02:11:04.857 --> 02:11:05.858
Who is this?

02:11:07.192 --> 02:11:10.654
Eniola, Eniola,

02:11:11.488 --> 02:11:15.617
Your boldness is more than that of a dog
who has walked into a lion's den,

02:11:15.701 --> 02:11:16.743
You!

02:11:16.827 --> 02:11:20.873
Why should I be afraid of a lion
that is so powerless?

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:23.000
You stupid woman! What are--

02:11:23.625 --> 02:11:25.627
[choking]

02:11:29.715 --> 02:11:33.886
The taproot that stands in the way
of an elephant will definitely be crushed,

You come into my house

and you are being rude?

In the last nine months, you have had
in excess of 50 million naira,

But you and I know he's just a front man
for the business,,,

02:31:33.042 --> 02:31:34.293
Inspector Gobir!

02:31:34.376 --> 02:31:36.295
,,,and Aare Akinwande,

02:31:41.175 --> 02:31:44.595
Ah, This does not mean a thing,

02:31:45.137 --> 02:31:47.890
He and I have been involved
in some business ventures,

02:31:47.973 --> 02:31:51.393
Oh, really? But you did not
see the last page, See here,

02:31:53.521 --> 02:31:58.609
This contains the details of all the calls
you made on the 13th of August 2017,

02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:01.445
What?

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:05.825
You were careful to block your number,

02:32:05.908 --> 02:32:08.702
making it untraceable for me
on the other end,

02:32:08.994 --> 02:32:11.956
But you cannot erase the record
of the numbers you called,

02:32:13.124 --> 02:32:15.751
You see this? You see this, sir?

02:32:16.544 --> 02:32:21.173
You called this number
at exactly 23:30 hours,

02:32:23.634 --> 02:32:25.177
That is my number,

02:32:25.678 --> 02:32:29.306
And that is the exact time
I got the call bribing me

02:32:29.390 --> 02:32:32.101
with $500,000 I found in my car,

02:32:32.184 --> 02:32:36.772
Inspector Gobir, I was told
you were downstairs, How's your wife?

02:32:36.856 --> 02:32:38.649
Much better, ma'am, She's much better,

02:32:38.732 --> 02:32:40.776
Aw, you must have missed her
home made food,

02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:43.028
I made some fine Egusi soup tonight,
Let me get you some,

02:32:43.112 --> 02:32:47.116
No, no, no, no, please, I don't want you
to go through the trouble,

02:32:47.199 --> 02:32:48.993
I ate before I came here,

02:32:49.076 --> 02:32:52.121
Oh, It's no trouble,
Okay, at least something to drink,

02:32:52.204 --> 02:32:53.289
A cold beer?

02:32:53.372 --> 02:32:56.667
Woman! He says he doesn't want anything!

02:33:49.094 --> 02:33:51.931
So, what do you intend to do now?

02:33:53.807 --> 02:33:54.975
The right thing,

02:33:57.353 --> 02:33:59.688
Gobir, that would be a mistake,

02:34:03.484 --> 02:34:06.946
A mistake? For me or for you?

02:34:07.029 --> 02:34:10.783
Oh, spare me the sanctimonious bullshit,

02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:14.411
I have been on the force
for over 40 years,

02:34:14.495 --> 02:34:16.121
What do I have out of it?

02:34:16.205 --> 02:34:21.293
A salary that barely feeds my family
or gotten my kids through school?

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:27.341
Gobir, I got this house
just six months ago,

02:34:28.384 --> 02:34:32.596
And look at you, you can't afford
to treat your dying wife,

02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:34.640
You will leave my wife out of this!

02:34:34.723 --> 02:34:37.726
[in Hausa]
Don't bring her into this,

02:34:37.810 --> 02:34:39.311
Look, all I'm saying is

02:34:39.395 --> 02:34:44.984
I am just a small fish
in the big river of things,

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:49.571
It is not just me,
Everyone is on the take,

02:34:51.156 --> 02:34:53.784
This is how the economy keeps moving,

02:34:55.577 --> 02:34:58.664
You make it look
as if I'm doing something strange

02:34:58.747 --> 02:35:00.624
when you're the odd one out,

02:35:01.834 --> 02:35:04.336
So that's why you sold your soul
to the devil?

02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:06.922
I didn't sell my soul,

02:35:07.756 --> 02:35:12.553
I just look the other way
when it is necessary,

02:35:14.054 --> 02:35:17.516
You bribed me, pretending it was from her,

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:23.981
All we needed was a stronger case
to have a hold on her,

02:35:24.857 --> 02:35:28.193
We needed her out immediately
and you were taking your time,

02:35:32.197 --> 02:35:35.826
So what if I had kept the money,
and I didn't report it?

02:35:36.493 --> 02:35:43.292
Ah, come on, Gobir, It is you,
You are straighter than a ruler,

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:47.463
[Gobir] And what about the assassination
outside the court?

02:35:47.546 --> 02:35:50.841
That has nothing to do with me,
absolutely,

02:35:51.633 --> 02:35:55.971
We just needed a stronger case
to arrest her,

02:35:59.016 --> 02:36:01.018
[scoffs]

02:36:07.649 --> 02:36:11.862
Look, they are going after her tonight,

02:36:23.123 --> 02:36:24.375
What?

02:36:24.458 --> 02:36:28.921
They can't afford to keep her alive,
She is too much of a threat,

02:36:30.506 --> 02:36:34.218
They are going after her
before she is transferred tomorrow,

02:36:42.059 --> 02:36:43.143
How did you know this?

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:45.104
I don't know much,

02:36:45.979 --> 02:36:49.233
All I'm supposed to do
is to secure access to her,

02:36:50.192 --> 02:36:51.735
and look the other way,

02:36:53.028 --> 02:36:54.738
The guards have been paid off,

02:36:58.450 --> 02:37:02.246
It's amazing how you are able
to wake up every day

02:37:02.788 --> 02:37:04.998
and look at yourself in the mirror,

02:37:05.082 --> 02:37:11.296
Look, she is not a saint,
She is a murderer, the scum of the earth,

02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:16.343
People like that deserve
whatever comes to them, and even more,

02:37:18.887 --> 02:37:23.267
No matter how you try
to reason this out in your head,

02:37:23.350 --> 02:37:30.065
it does not change the fact that
the blood of that woman and her family

02:37:31.108 --> 02:37:32.568
is on your hands,

02:37:34.653 --> 02:37:39.700
And I will ensure you are punished
to the fullest extent of the law,

02:37:43.287 --> 02:37:49.001
Please, this is my life,
This is my family,

02:38:03.891 --> 02:38:07.728
Your family and the rest of the world

02:38:07.811 --> 02:38:11.690
deserve to see you for who you truly are,

02:38:12.608 --> 02:38:14.818
An utter disgrace!

02:38:18.906 --> 02:38:19.907
Sir,

02:38:30.125 --> 02:38:33.253
Yes, Samuel, I need you
to do something very urgent for me,

02:38:34.171 --> 02:38:36.173
-Yeah? I'd like you to,,,
-[call waiting beeping]

02:38:37.966 --> 02:38:39.968
Stay on the line, Samuel, Don't hang up,

02:38:41.637 --> 02:38:42.930
-Dr, Shobanjo?
-[static]

02:38:43.013 --> 02:38:46.975
Mr, Gobir, Mr, Gobir, can you,,,

02:38:47.059 --> 02:38:48.227
[Gobir] Yes, how did it go?

02:38:48.310 --> 02:38:49.895
-[static]
-Mr, Gobir, can you hear me?

02:38:49.978 --> 02:38:51.647
-Mr, Gobir, your wife is,,,
-Is she out already?

02:38:51.730 --> 02:38:53.899
-Can you hear me? Mr, Gobir,
-Hello?

02:38:54.316 --> 02:38:57.903
-Your wife is--
-Dr, Shobanjo, can you hear me?

02:38:57.986 --> 02:38:59.279
-Mr, Gobir,,,
-Hello?

02:38:59.363 --> 02:39:00.405
[line disconnects]

02:39:00.489 --> 02:39:03.033
Please could you tell my wife
that I'll be there soon?

02:39:03.116 --> 02:39:05.327
I needed to sort out
something very urgent,

02:39:05.744 --> 02:39:10.707
Hello? Hello, Doctor,,, Oh, God,

02:39:13.252 --> 02:39:17.422
Samuel, Yes, please I need backup,
You have to put a squad together

02:39:17.506 --> 02:39:20.175
and come meet me
at the secret female holding facility,

02:39:20.259 --> 02:39:21.510
ASAP, Please,

02:39:26.181 --> 02:39:28.684
[man] Quickly, Quickly,

02:39:29.142 --> 02:39:31.603
Pour it inside and everywhere,

02:39:38.777 --> 02:39:40.362
Ah! Cigarette!

02:39:41.738 --> 02:39:43.448
[in Yoruba]
Boss, you're holding a cigarette!

02:39:59.798 --> 02:40:01.133
[in Yoruba]
Who is that?

02:40:06.638 --> 02:40:07.681
Who is there?

02:40:27.242 --> 02:40:28.327
Akorede,

02:40:31.538 --> 02:40:32.914
I knew you would come,

02:40:36.084 --> 02:40:37.502
I was wondering when,

02:40:38.003 --> 02:40:41.840
[in Yoruba]
Oh! So you've been expecting me?

02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:47.179
The Bible says

02:40:49.723 --> 02:40:51.224
where there is carcass,

02:40:54.186 --> 02:40:56.271
vultures gather,

02:40:56.563 --> 02:41:00.734
So you know it all ends tonight?
You will die tonight,

02:41:00.817 --> 02:41:02.861
[laughing]

02:41:04.363 --> 02:41:06.114
-Akorede!
-Hmm?

02:41:08.992 --> 02:41:15.374
You can only kill the body,
You cannot kill the spirit,

02:41:15.457 --> 02:41:19.711
Because my spirit is already gone,
It left with my children,

02:41:19.795 --> 02:41:22.506
Mama, Then my work is done,

02:41:22.756 --> 02:41:26.885
I'm the one who killed them,

02:41:27.344 --> 02:41:29.805
What do you want?

02:41:29.888 --> 02:41:31.556
What do you want?

02:41:33.433 --> 02:41:35.227
Korede, you want to kill me?

02:41:35.686 --> 02:41:38.146
Where is the knife? Give me your knife,

02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:42.317
[in Yoruba] Give me the gun,
I'll do it, I'll kill myself!

02:41:42.609 --> 02:41:43.944
I'll make it quick!

02:41:44.903 --> 02:41:46.697
I'll save you the trouble!

02:41:47.114 --> 02:41:51.743
And what would be my pleasure in that?
There is no satisfaction in that,

02:41:52.327 --> 02:41:57.833
I want to see you weeping,
wailing, and begging in agony,

02:41:57.916 --> 02:42:00.711
-I even want to see that in my dreams,
-Your mother,

02:42:02.254 --> 02:42:03.839
Your grandmother,

02:42:05.298 --> 02:42:10.262
Your mother must have cursed God
when she was giving birth to you,

02:42:11.263 --> 02:42:14.224
[laughing]

02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:18.770
Korede! I'll wait for you in hell!

02:42:20.021 --> 02:42:23.442
Korede! Korede!

02:42:24.317 --> 02:42:26.319
[men chattering]

02:42:30.031 --> 02:42:31.324
[in Yoruba]
Let's go,

02:42:58.769 --> 02:43:00.020
[glass shatters]

02:43:02.981 --> 02:43:04.983
[Gobir speaking foreign language]

02:43:09.613 --> 02:43:12.616
[continues in foreign language]

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:18.789
Who did this? Who did this?

02:43:24.377 --> 02:43:25.712
What happened here?

02:43:27.005 --> 02:43:29.591
I don't know, sir,
We went to buy food, sir,

02:43:29.674 --> 02:43:34.513
You went to-- Both of you? Huh?
Where is Alhaja? Where is Alhaja?

02:43:34.596 --> 02:43:35.847
Sir,,,

02:43:36.973 --> 02:43:38.934
Call the fire service!
Call the fire brigade!

02:43:39.017 --> 02:43:42.813
Do as he says! Call the fire service now!
Call the fire service!

02:43:42.896 --> 02:43:43.897
Give me the key!

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:45.649
-Sir,
-Give me the key! Where's the key?

02:43:47.818 --> 02:43:49.236
Go! Go! Go!

02:43:50.904 --> 02:43:52.239
Move! Move!

02:43:52.322 --> 02:43:53.865
It's very dangerous, sir,

02:43:54.991 --> 02:43:56.701
You think I don't know what happened?

02:43:57.077 --> 02:43:59.496
[in Hausa] I swear, I'll deal with you
if anything happens to that woman,

02:43:59.579 --> 02:44:02.082
Sir, calm down, Calm down, calm down,

02:44:02.165 --> 02:44:03.542
It's very dangerous,

02:44:05.877 --> 02:44:09.130
Samuel, just, somebody,,,
We need to get her out of there,

02:44:09.214 --> 02:44:11.925
-But how, sir?
-Get me a ladder,

02:44:12.008 --> 02:44:14.553
-I think I saw one at the security post,
-Go!

02:44:14.636 --> 02:44:15.679
Hurry up! Hurry up!

Yes?

02:44:27.482 --> 02:44:28.692
[woman] Are you okay?

02:44:28.775 --> 02:44:29.860
[sighs]

02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:32.988
I'm okay,

02:44:35.198 --> 02:44:36.700
I will be out soon,

02:44:38.743 --> 02:44:39.828
[woman] Okay,

02:44:55.468 --> 02:44:56.678
-Detective Samuel?
-Yes, sir,

02:44:56.761 --> 02:44:59.347
Please ensure the fire brigade
is on their way,

02:46:51.418 --> 02:46:53.169
It's time to go,

It's time, let's go,

02:46:58.717 --> 02:46:59.968
[Eniola] Don't touch me,

02:47:01.011 --> 02:47:02.053
[Gobir] Please let's go,

02:47:02.137 --> 02:47:04.556
[Eniola] Don't touch me! Let me be,

02:47:04.639 --> 02:47:07.976
Mrs, Salami, please we don't have time,
We need to leave now, please,

02:47:08.059 --> 02:47:11.271
Let us go,
This is not how you want to die,

02:47:11.354 --> 02:47:15.358
How do you know? If I don't die here,
they will kill me out there,

02:47:15.775 --> 02:47:17.944
Those people will never let me
walk away alive,

02:47:18.945 --> 02:47:20.572
Mrs, Salami, please,

02:47:20.655 --> 02:47:22.657

02:47:35.462 --> 02:47:37.464
[siren wailing]

02:47:56.191 --> 02:47:58.860
We need to take her to the hospital
for further treatment,

02:47:58.943 --> 02:48:01.071
We cannot tell how much smoke
she has inhaled,

02:48:01.154 --> 02:48:03.239
She cannot go alone with you
in this vehicle,

02:48:03.323 --> 02:48:04.741
She is a high risk prisoner,

02:48:04.824 --> 02:48:07.535
It's okay, Detective Samuel,
She will ride with me instead,

02:48:07.619 --> 02:48:09.537
I mean, my wife is in the same hospital,

02:48:09.621 --> 02:48:10.955
Okay, sir, I will join you,

02:48:11.039 --> 02:48:14.626
No, I need someone here I can trust,

02:48:14.709 --> 02:48:18.213
Just make sure all these things
are handled properly,

02:48:18.296 --> 02:48:21.007
And the guys on duty,
get them into custody,

02:48:21.925 --> 02:48:24.719
When backup arrives, send a few men
to the hospital to relieve me,

02:48:24.803 --> 02:48:26.471
-Yes, sir,
-Please let's go, Mrs, Salami,

02:48:26.554 --> 02:48:29.891
-Sorry, Easy, easy,,,
-Thank you,

02:48:32.102 --> 02:48:34.145
-Hello, Dr, Shobanjo?
-Mr, Gobir, I've been trying to reach you,

02:48:34.229 --> 02:48:36.356
-I'm sorry, I'm on my way immediately,
-Mr, Gobir,

02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:39.400
-Is she awake? How is she doing?
-Mr, Gobir? Mr, Gobir?

02:48:40.276 --> 02:48:44.531
-Dr, Sho--
-I'm sorry, she's gone,

02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:46.491
We lost her during surgery,

02:48:48.743 --> 02:48:53.081
Mr, Gobir,,, Mr, Gobir, are you there?
Mr, Gobir?

02:48:55.625 --> 02:48:57.627
[sobbing]

02:49:06.010 --> 02:49:08.012
[shouting, wailing]

02:50:02.817 --> 02:50:05.486
If you walk to the end of the road,
at the junction,,,

02:50:09.365 --> 02:50:11.659
there's a 24-hour call center,

02:50:14.245 --> 02:50:16.998
Do you have anyone you trust
that can come and get you?

02:50:19.751 --> 02:50:25.506
Mr, Gobir, I don't understand,

02:50:47.695 --> 02:50:48.738
There,

02:50:49.948 --> 02:50:51.199
[sniffles]

02:50:51.282 --> 02:50:52.492
For the call,

02:50:53.576 --> 02:50:56.704
There's enough there
in case you need to get a taxi,

02:51:00.041 --> 02:51:04.504
I don't,,, I still don't understand,

02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:09.634
You're right, Mrs, Salami,

02:51:11.552 --> 02:51:13.304
They're not gonna let you live,

02:51:15.556 --> 02:51:17.350
There's too much death,

02:51:26.109 --> 02:51:27.527
Mr, Gobir,,,

02:51:29.654 --> 02:51:32.323
won't you get into trouble for doing this?

02:51:33.866 --> 02:51:36.369
I'll find something to tell them,

02:51:36.452 --> 02:51:37.578
Oh, my God,

02:51:40.373 --> 02:51:42.000
Your men cornered me and,,,

02:51:44.419 --> 02:51:45.420
Something,

02:51:50.341 --> 02:51:54.679
You are going to have to disappear,
Mrs, Salami,

02:51:59.309 --> 02:52:03.313
It will be bad for both of us
if you are caught again,

02:52:07.191 --> 02:52:09.694
I know this will not
bring back your children,

02:52:11.404 --> 02:52:15.158
but I'm sorry for everything,

02:52:19.245 --> 02:52:20.330
I'm sorry,,,

02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:24.167
I just didn't know,

02:52:41.976 --> 02:52:43.019
You can go,

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:47.273
Mr, Gobir, thank you,

02:52:49.025 --> 02:52:50.860
Thank you very much,

02:53:21.682 --> 02:53:26.771
This morning, respected industrialist
and political godfather Aare Akinwande

02:53:26.854 --> 02:53:29.023
was picked up by security operatives

02:53:29.107 --> 02:53:33.778
on suspicion of money laundering,
bribery, corruption and murder,

02:53:33.861 --> 02:53:35.863
[news jingle]

02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:41.953
Nuru, you should be proud of yourself,

02:53:42.036 --> 02:53:44.831
This would never
have happened without you,

02:53:47.125 --> 02:53:50.336
In one month, they will drop all charges,

02:53:51.379 --> 02:53:54.257
and everyone will forget
this ever happened,

02:53:56.134 --> 02:54:00.430
In two years,
he will contest for presidency,

02:54:01.597 --> 02:54:02.932
and he will win,

02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:07.645
[in Hausa]
What a wasted job,

02:54:08.271 --> 02:54:13.192
Nuru, but you should never give up hope,

02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:16.988
[in Hausa]
Never give up hope,

02:54:17.071 --> 02:54:19.073
[phone vibrating]

02:54:29.417 --> 02:54:31.419
[laughing]

02:54:51.898 --> 02:54:53.733
[news anchor]
His arrest is part of a larger bust

02:54:53.816 --> 02:54:56.819
that involves high-ranking officers
of the NCCC,

02:54:56.903 --> 02:54:57.904
[officers shouting]

02:54:57.987 --> 02:55:00.615
A series of arrests has been made
throughout the week

02:55:00.698 --> 02:55:03.534
in what has been described
as a major conspiracy

02:55:03.618 --> 02:55:07.371
of witness intimidation,
evidence tampering, and bribery,

02:55:07.455 --> 02:55:08.456
Open this door!

02:55:08.539 --> 02:55:11.876
Inspector Shehu, don't try that thing
I suspect you want to do, Do not try it!

02:55:11.959 --> 02:55:15.004
-Open this door!
-[gunshot]

02:55:20.843 --> 02:55:23.471
[screams]

02:55:25.556 --> 02:55:29.018
This immediately follows the escape
of disgraced businesswoman

02:55:29.101 --> 02:55:32.939
and suspected drug lord,
Alhaja Eniola Salami,

02:55:33.564 --> 02:55:36.150
There is a nationwide manhunt,

02:55:36.234 --> 02:55:39.487
and the police have warned
anyone who comes across the Alhaja

02:55:39.570 --> 02:55:42.698
to report to their police station
immediately,

02:55:42.782 --> 02:55:45.451
She is being described
as extremely dangerous,

02:55:45.535 --> 02:55:46.702
[gun cocks]

02:55:48.079 --> 02:55:51.791
-[Pidgin] Maka,,, I got message for you,
-What sort of madness is this?

02:55:51.874 --> 02:55:53.709
I even wrote it on my palm,

02:55:54.752 --> 02:55:57.964
[in Yoruba]
"I'll see you in hell,"

02:55:58.047 --> 02:56:01.884
[in Pidgin] Did I get it?
You know my Yoruba isn't too good,

02:56:02.593 --> 02:56:04.762
-[in Pidgin] You got it right, boss,
-Speed!

02:56:06.931 --> 02:56:08.015
Saheed!

02:56:09.183 --> 02:56:10.226
Milo!

02:56:42.633 --> 02:56:45.553

02:56:46.387 --> 02:56:48.931
Goddamn, she fine, What's up, mama?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Mm-mmm, I am talking to you,

What are you gonna do about that?

02:57:13.623 --> 02:57:15.583
Who the fuck you think you talking to?

02:57:15.666 --> 02:57:17.793

02:58:05.883 --> 02:58:09.011

I'm going to serve you all
another round of beers, on the house,

02:58:14.767 --> 02:58:16.727
