36:28.061 --> 36:29.270
[ENGINE REVS]

36:38.113 --> 36:40.406
- Artie, what are you doing?
- I'm charging her.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.408
She'll get scared. She'll brake.

36:45.620 --> 36:49.039
What if she doesn't?
Artie, what if she doesn't stop--? Artie!

36:59.301 --> 37:01.260
Ha!

37:02.596 --> 37:05.931
Yeah.
See, this wasn't my first drag race.

37:10.854 --> 37:14.899
His first field mission in a while
was bound to have some hiccups.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.736
- He's fine.
- Right.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.538
Okay, so why are we still here?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.540
Because we didn't bring the killer
to justice?

37:31.708 --> 37:34.501
In a noir, a bullet is justice.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.629
- Hey, Mykes.
- What?

37:36.838 --> 37:39.214
PETE: I think I'm getting
some black-and-white vibage.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.884
Now, I'm working a hunch here...

37:42.093 --> 37:45.679
...but just cross everything you got,
sweetheart.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.353
Nice.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.189
How did you know
that the fog would be our ride home?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.399
PETE:
It's the end of Casablanca.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.652
They stole that from Bishop, you know.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.946
PETE:
And here he comes.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.408
Guess they stole the tearful goodbye too.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.786
I don't understand.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.705
We love each other.
We can go to Bora-Bora now.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.290
I can't stay.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.126
I'm not from this world.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.588
It's hard to explain.
Believe me, I don't want to go.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.465
Then stay with me.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.179
Be good, kid.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.939
What would happen if he stayed?

38:37.148 --> 38:39.191
The story's over.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.861
I don't know
if you get your happily-ever-after...

38:43.071 --> 38:45.322
...or you just fade away.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.917
One more second with her
is a happier ending...

38:57.127 --> 38:58.877
...than a lifetime without her.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.424
Okay, now that is a good line.

39:09.723 --> 39:11.765
All right, all right. I'll read the books.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.058
[MYKA LAUGHS]

39:15.437 --> 39:18.522
Go ahead. I know you want to.

39:19.566 --> 39:23.736
So the detective and his....

39:23.945 --> 39:25.571
Intrepid gal Friday.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.948
The detective and his gal Friday...

39:28.992 --> 39:30.951
...walked off into the fog...

39:31.161 --> 39:33.620
...and left the lovers in their embrace.

39:33.830 --> 39:36.790
An embrace that would last forever.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.710
Maybe, just maybe.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.086
[PETE CHUCKLES]

39:48.678 --> 39:50.012
Okay.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.306
That was, um.... Heh.

39:53.683 --> 39:54.725
What was that?

39:56.061 --> 39:58.937
[IMITATES BOGART] That was the stuff
dreams are made of, sweetheart.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.689
[CHUCKLES]

40:01.232 --> 40:04.234
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
And also painful. Ah.

40:04.444 --> 40:05.611
Really, really painful.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.576
All the pages have writing
on them now.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.079
We finished the story.

40:21.669 --> 40:26.256
It's just that jumping in front of
a speeding car with Claudia in the trunk...

40:26.466 --> 40:30.260
...playing chicken with a car thief,
Artie wasn't just putting himself in danger.

40:30.470 --> 40:34.014
It was everyone. I know that he says
that he was following his gut...

40:34.224 --> 40:36.850
...but I'm afraid
that he's being unnecessarily reckless.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.521
And I'm really worried about him.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.191
Thank you for your candour.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.319
We've been worried about Agent Nielsen
as well.

40:47.529 --> 40:48.904
This confirms our fears.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.489
What does that mean?

40:51.699 --> 40:53.492
It's time for the Regents to act.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.954
When you asked me to keep an eye
on Artie, you said it was to help him.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.957
- Trust us, Agent Jinks.
- Well, wait a sec--

41:00.166 --> 41:04.461
I mean, Mr. Kosan,
I know what it's like to go through trauma.

41:05.213 --> 41:08.882
The last few months are not something
Artie will get through easily or quickly.

41:09.092 --> 41:11.677
We need to be there for him.
Not bronze him...

41:11.886 --> 41:13.971
...or turn him
into some H.G. Wells hologram.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.806
Noted, Agent Jinks.

41:16.850 --> 41:19.893
The less you know,
the better it is for Agent Nielsen.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.689
As I say, trust us.

41:30.572 --> 41:33.073
"--is very dashing."

41:33.741 --> 41:36.827
I am dashing, aren't I?

41:37.245 --> 41:40.956
What? "With a big dopey grin."
What--? Heh.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.334
I don't have a dopey grin.

41:46.045 --> 41:49.047
What? Don't Bogart the end.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.216
Pete, listen to this.

41:51.968 --> 41:55.470
"It was a long trip, but it was worth it
to see the look on Lily's face...

41:55.680 --> 41:59.016
...when she pressed her toes into the sand
of Bora-Bora for the first time.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.352
Neither of them had ever seen water
this blue.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.939
She smiled brighter
than the tropical sun.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.859
It made him happier than he'd been
in a long time."

42:10.403 --> 42:12.237
Good for Bishop.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.365
Yeah.

42:17.410 --> 42:22.247
But, you know, a warm, fuzzy ending...

42:22.457 --> 42:27.002
...doesn't really make sense
for a gritty crime novel.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.172
Well, maybe that's why
he had writer's block.

42:30.381 --> 42:35.219
He didn't realise
he was writing a love story.
