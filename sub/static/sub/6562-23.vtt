AND HE'S GOT TO HAVE
A GREAT TIME

09:22.700 --> 09:25.667
SO WE CAN MOVE UP POP TIGER'S

09:25.667 --> 09:26.567
PLEASE.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.167

ALONE WITH HIM.

09:31.633 --> 09:33.067

09:33.067 --> 09:35.700
WHY DON'T YOU GET THIS LADY

09:35.700 --> 09:36.667
- UH.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.167

09:38.167 --> 09:41.067
I'LL TELL THE POP TIGER LADY
OUR DATE WAS AWESOME.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.600
- SMOOTHIES, IT IS.

09:48.367 --> 09:52.600
- SO, KATIE, WOULD YOU LIKE--
- NO.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.633
- WITH THE DEMUTUALIZED
STOCK CREDIT, A NEW IRA ACCOUNT,

09:55.633 --> 09:59.067
AND EXTRA DEDUCTIONS
ON FOOTCARE,

09:59.067 --> 10:01.167
YOUR TAX RETURN IS...

10:01.167 --> 10:03.167

10:03.167 --> 10:06.500
OH, LOGEY,
THIS IS THE BEST DATE EVER!

10:10.567 --> 10:14.900

10:22.600 --> 10:24.167

FOR THE HATERS *

10:24.167 --> 10:27.100

WHO TRY TO SHUT US DOWN *

10:27.100 --> 10:28.967
* THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW *

10:28.967 --> 10:30.433
* THERE AIN'T NOTHING
THEY CAN DO *

10:30.433 --> 10:34.333
* THAT CAN TEAR US APART,
NO *

10:34.333 --> 10:37.633
- * THIS WALL WE BUILT
TOGETHER *

10:37.633 --> 10:40.467
* THERE AIN'T NO WAY
OF KNOCKING IT OVER *

10:40.467 --> 10:42.933
* WE'LL BE HERE FOREVER *

10:42.933 --> 10:45.933
- * GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER,
BABY *

10:45.933 --> 10:50.500
- * 'CAUSE THE WORLD STOPS

10:50.500 --> 10:52.800
* AROUND YA,
OH, WHOA *

10:52.800 --> 10:55.100

10:55.100 --> 10:58.233
- OH, THAT WAS THE BEST DATE
OF MY LIFE,

10:58.233 --> 11:01.833
AND WE STILL HAVE TO HIT
SANTA MONICA PIER, RODEO DRIVE,

11:01.833 --> 11:03.933
THE PLACE
WITH ALL THE FAMOUS FOOTPRINTS,

11:03.933 --> 11:05.567
AND MY SISTER'S.

11:05.567 --> 11:06.933
BUT FIRST,

11:06.933 --> 11:08.967
HELP ME OFF WITH MY BOOTS.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.967
- I WOULD LOVE TO,

11:10.967 --> 11:13.333
BUT I'VE GOT TO GO
DO SOMETHING REAL QUICK, OKAY?

11:18.767 --> 11:19.833
WATCH OUT!

11:32.733 --> 11:33.767
OH.

11:33.767 --> 11:36.233
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:36.233 --> 11:37.767
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON YOUR DATE.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.067
- I'VE TRIED.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.767
I KNOW WE HAVE TO CLIMB
THE POP TIGER COVER,

11:40.767 --> 11:42.200
BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.300
GET ME OUT OF THIS DATE.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.700
PLEASE. PLEASE.

11:47.233 --> 11:48.833
- HEY.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.067
WHERE'S BOBBY?

11:50.067 --> 11:52.267
- WELL, FIRST HE TRIED
TO KISS ME,

11:52.267 --> 11:53.767
THEN I THREATENED TO PUNCH HIM,

11:53.767 --> 11:56.367
THEN HE TRIED AGAIN,
THEN I DID PUNCH HIM,

11:56.367 --> 11:58.867
THEN I TOLD HIM TO GET LOST,
AND HE DID.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.933
- HE'S GONE?

12:00.933 --> 12:03.133
- HEY.
WHERE'S BOBBY?

12:03.133 --> 12:04.600
BOYS ARE A HUGE NEW MARKET
FOR POP TIGER,

12:04.600 --> 12:07.400
SO WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
THIS PLAYDATE WITH YOU TWO.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.967
- YEAH, BOBBY.
YEAH, YEAH.

12:09.967 --> 12:11.133
WHERE ISN'T BOBBY?

12:11.133 --> 12:12.533
- YOU DIDN'T LOSE HIM, DID YOU?

12:12.533 --> 12:14.400
- WHAT? NO.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.667
NO!

12:15.667 --> 12:17.267
BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

12:17.267 --> 12:19.700
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ONE
DID LOSE THEIR POP TIGER DATE?

12:21.267 --> 12:24.400
- OH, WELL, THE MAGAZINE
WOULD HAVE TO DISTANCE ITSELF

12:24.400 --> 12:27.133
FROM A PUBLIC RELATIONS SCANDAL
LIKE THAT,

12:27.133 --> 12:28.667
SO I GUESS BIG TIME RUSH
WOULD BE BANNED

12:28.667 --> 12:29.967
FROM POP TIGER
FOR LIFE.

12:29.967 --> 12:32.300
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

12:32.300 --> 12:33.400
- GOOD THING I DIDN'T LOSE HIM.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.633
- SO WHERE'S BOBBY?

12:39.633 --> 12:43.233
- HE WENT TO GET US SMOOTHIES.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.400
- BUT YOU'RE HOLDING SMOOTHIES.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.833
- HE WANTED SMOOTHER SMOOTHIES.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.233
- OH, WELL, WE WILL GO
GET PHOTOS

12:54.233 --> 12:56.067
OF THE OTHER GUYS
ON THEIR DATES.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.767
CAN YOU AND BOBBY MEET US
AT THE POOL IN 15 MINUTES?

12:57.767 --> 12:59.567
- 30 MINUTES? PERFECT.

12:59.567 --> 13:02.267
BOBBY AND I WILL SEE YOU
IN ONE HOUR.

13:02.267 --> 13:03.200
- OKAY.

13:05.067 --> 13:07.833
- SMOOTHER SMOOTHIES?
- YES.

13:07.833 --> 13:08.967
- HEY, I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

13:08.967 --> 13:11.533
YOU DOGS
DON'T MESS UP YOUR DATES.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.333
- TOO LATE.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.333
- I DIDN'T LOSE HIM.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.467
HE'S JUST...MISPLACED.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.433
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT POP TIGER
WILL DO

13:18.433 --> 13:19.900
IF THEY FIND OUT
WE'VE LOST A KID?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.433
- YES, THEY WILL BAN US
FROM THE MAGAZINE.

13:22.433 --> 13:24.367
- THEY'LL BAN US
FROM THE MAGAZINE?

13:24.367 --> 13:26.900
THAT IS WAY WORSE
THAN WHAT I THOUGHT.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.567
WE HAVE GOT TO FIND THAT KID.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.233
- FIRST YOU WANT TIFFANY.
NOW YOU WANT JEANETTE.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.600
ALL THIS SWITCHING SEEMS MEAN.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.167
- EXACTLY, WHICH IS WHY
I'M TRYING TO FIX THE SWITCH

13:38.167 --> 13:39.400
BY SWITCHING BACK.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.567
MEATBALL SUB.

13:41.567 --> 13:45.733
LADIES, IT SEEMS THERE'S BEEN
A MIX-UP WITH THE MIX-UP,

13:45.733 --> 13:48.267
AND THE MIX-UP IS,
THERE WAS NO MIX-UP.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.600
- SERIOUSLY?

13:49.600 --> 13:52.067
- SO WE'LL JUST SWITCH BACK
AND TAKE YOU LADIES

13:52.067 --> 13:53.433
TO OUR FAVORITE
HOLLYWOOD HANGOUT

13:53.433 --> 13:55.367
AND TALK ABOUT HAIR PRODUCTS.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.433
- OH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.100
- SO, TIFFANY,

13:58.100 --> 13:59.833
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
FROM NEWPORT, RIGHT?

13:59.833 --> 14:01.833
WHAT'S IT LIKE THERE?
- IT'S AWESOME.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.067
MY DAD OWNS A COMBINATION

14:03.067 --> 14:05.100
YACHT CLUB, ROLLER-COASTER PARK,
SKI RESORT.

14:08.367 --> 14:11.067
- RONA, WE APOLOGIZE
FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING.

14:11.067 --> 14:14.700
IT'S JUST THAT A TYPICAL
POP TIGER READER IS UNDER 18,

14:14.700 --> 14:15.667
NOT...

14:15.667 --> 14:18.967
WAY OVER UNDER 18.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.933
- THAT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

14:20.933 --> 14:23.467
I MEAN, I GUESS IT WAS
KIND OF SILLY

14:23.467 --> 14:25.633
ENTERING
A TEEN MAGAZINE CONTEST.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.767
I'LL JUST GRAB A CAB
TO MY SISTER'S.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.100
BUT YOUR TYPICAL READER
SHOULD KNOW

14:32.100 --> 14:36.100
WHAT A SWEET, HANDSOME,
KIND YOUNG MAN LO-GAIN IS.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.533
- WE'RE REALLY SORRY ABOUT
HOW THIS TURNED OUT, LOGAN.

14:45.533 --> 14:47.700
- OH, IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:47.700 --> 14:48.800
- YOU DID WRITE DOWN
THE PART

14:48.800 --> 14:51.067
ABOUT LOGAN BEING HANDSOME,
RIGHT?

14:51.067 --> 14:52.900
- OKAY, WELL,
SINCE WE'RE DOWN A COUPLE,

14:52.900 --> 14:55.200
WE SHOULD PROBABLY DOUBLE UP
ON PHOTOS OF KENDALL AND BOBBY.

14:56.433 --> 15:00.933
- BOBBY. BOBBY.
BOBBY. BOBBY!

15:00.933 --> 15:05.200
- BOB, COME OUT, YOU BIG-TIME

15:11.433 --> 15:12.633

[man screaming]

15:17.067 --> 15:18.900
[animal roars]

15:18.900 --> 15:20.600

15:20.600 --> 15:22.400
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME
TO FIND HIM,

15:22.400 --> 15:24.700
AND WE JUST HAVE TO FIND HIM,
AND--

15:24.700 --> 15:25.933
[screaming]

15:25.933 --> 15:28.433
- THERE YOU ARE.
TIME FOR THAT DATE PHOTO.

15:28.433 --> 15:29.900
WHERE'S BOBBY?

15:29.900 --> 15:30.767
- WE DON'T KNOW.

15:34.500 --> 15:38.167
- WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE--

15:38.167 --> 15:39.467
BECAUSE--

15:39.467 --> 15:42.700
- BECAUSE HE'S THE BEST
HIDE AND SEEK PLAYER EVER.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.533
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
HIDE AND SEEK.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.133
THAT IS THE GAME
THAT WE'RE PLAYING,

15:46.133 --> 15:48.267
AND IT IS FUN.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.067
- AND DON'T YOU WORRY,
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA FIND

15:50.067 --> 15:52.067
THE LITTLE FUNSTER'S
HIDING SPOT.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.567
- I LOVE IT!

15:53.567 --> 15:55.467
THIS'LL BE GREAT
IN NEXT MONTH'S SPREAD.

15:55.467 --> 15:56.933
GET SOME PHOTOS OF KENDALL
LOOKING FOR BOBBY.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.833
- UH, COME ON!

16:19.500 --> 16:21.167
- THIS PLACE IS SO COOL.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.767
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THE COFFEE'S GREAT.

16:22.767 --> 16:23.900

16:23.900 --> 16:25.500
THE MEATBALL SUB.

16:27.567 --> 16:28.567
- WELL...

16:28.567 --> 16:30.933
WE'RE NOT HUNGRY.

16:30.933 --> 16:33.500
SO HOW ABOUT YOU GO
GET US SOME COFFEES, JAMES?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.067
[chair breaks]

16:38.067 --> 16:41.533
SO ARE YOU GIRLS LOOKING FORWARD
TO GOING TO THE PARTY TONIGHT?

16:41.533 --> 16:42.733
[phone vibrating and ringing]

16:42.733 --> 16:44.967
I'M SORRY, JUST A SECOND.
SORRY.

16:44.967 --> 16:46.533
[button beeps]

16:46.533 --> 16:48.133
WRONG NUMBER.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.467
UM, AS YOU WERE SAYING?

16:49.467 --> 16:51.367
- OH, IT'S GONNA BE SO--
- WELL, I WAS WONDERING--

16:51.367 --> 16:54.833
[phone vibrating]
- SORRY, JUST ONE SECOND.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.500

16:56.500 --> 16:57.633
[sound of glass shattering]

16:57.633 --> 16:59.067
OKAY, GO ON.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.067
- WELL, I WAS WONDERING--

17:00.067 --> 17:01.567
- PAGING CARLOS GARCIA.

17:01.567 --> 17:05.533
MR. CARLOS GARCIA, YOU HAVE
A CALL FROM MR. SCHWARTZ.

17:05.533 --> 17:06.533
- I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

17:06.533 --> 17:09.433
I'M GONNA GO DESTROY SOMEONE.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.400
- CARLOS GARCIA.
CARLOS GARCIA.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.800
- JAMES, IT IS NOT FAIR
TO OUR DATES

17:15.800 --> 17:17.167
TO KEEP SWITCHING
BACK AND FORTH.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.067
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
JUST FOCUS ON SHOWING THEM

17:19.067 --> 17:20.800
A GOOD TIME
BEFORE THE PARTY TONIGHT.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.067
- PLAYING HARDBALL, HUH?

17:23.133 --> 17:24.733
WHAT IF I GET YOU A MONKEY?
- NO.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.367
- A BUTLER?
- NO.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.333
- A MONKEY BUTLER?
- [gasps]

17:36.367 --> 17:37.367
- LET ME GUESS...

17:37.367 --> 17:38.833
both: ANOTHER MIX-UP?

17:38.833 --> 17:40.100
- WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

17:47.067 --> 17:48.333
[horn honking]

17:48.333 --> 17:50.067
- HEY, SOMEONE NEED A TAXI?

17:50.067 --> 17:53.233
- LOGEY, ARE YOU DRIVING ME
TO MY SISTER'S?

17:53.233 --> 17:56.433
- NOPE, I'M DRIVING YOU
TO THE SANTA MONICA PIER,

17:56.433 --> 17:58.900
RODEO DRIVE, THE PLACE
WITH THE FAMOUS HANDPRINTS,

17:58.900 --> 18:00.633
THEN TO YOUR SISTER'S.

18:00.633 --> 18:04.133
- BUT I THOUGHT I WASN'T
YOUR TYPICAL POP TIGER READER?

18:04.133 --> 18:07.333
- RONA, THERE IS NOTHING TYPICAL
ABOUT YOU.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.267
- [laughs]

18:10.967 --> 18:13.900
OH, LOGEY, YOU SURE KNOW
HOW TO TREAT A LADY.

18:15.067 --> 18:15.967
- ALL RIGHT, BUCKLE UP.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.733
- HE'S NOT IN THE MINIVAN.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.400
- HE'S NOT IN THE BUSHES.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.333
- TRY THE LOBBY.

18:27.633 --> 18:29.900
OH, NO.
TRY THE BAR.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.967
- LOBBY: BAD IDEA!

18:36.067 --> 18:40.067
SO BEFORE WE HIT THE PARTY,
THIS IS PALMWOODS PARK,

18:40.067 --> 18:42.400
WHERE BTR PLAYS TOUCH FOOTBALL,

18:42.400 --> 18:44.933
WHERE WE HIDE IN TREES
WHEN NECESSARY,

18:44.933 --> 18:45.867
AND...

18:47.400 --> 18:50.967
PICKS FLOWERS
FOR REALLY COOL GIRLS.

18:50.967 --> 18:52.700
- [sneezes]

18:52.700 --> 18:54.433
SORRY, I HAVE
A REALLY EMBARRASSING SNEEZE.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.433
- THAT'S OKAY.

18:55.433 --> 18:56.433
I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS

18:56.433 --> 18:58.133
WHO LIKE CUTE SNEEZES LIKE THAT.

18:58.133 --> 18:59.067
IN FACT, JAMES--

19:01.933 --> 19:02.867
- HEY, JAMES.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.867
- HEY, BUDDY.
CAN I GET A WORD WITH YOU?

19:06.867 --> 19:07.800
NOW!

19:10.067 --> 19:11.967
- WHAT?
WE WERE HAVING A MOMENT THERE.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.767
- NO, YOU'RE RUINING
THESE DATES.

19:13.767 --> 19:16.800
- WHICH IS WHY I SHOULD
TAKE JEANETTE TO THE PARTY.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.867
I MEAN, SHE SNEEZES SO CUTE,
AND WE BELONG TOGETHER.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.367
- I'M NOT SWITCHING ANYMORE.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.433
JAMES, THESE DATES ARE NOT
ABOUT US.

19:22.433 --> 19:25.067
IT'S ABOUT SHOWING
THESE TWO INCREDIBLY NICE GIRLS

19:25.067 --> 19:26.267
A GREAT DAY.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:29.900 --> 19:31.567
- THERE WAS ANOTHER MIX-UP
WITH THE CONTEST.

19:31.567 --> 19:32.733
