WEBVTT

01:46.190 --> 01:48.775
I know maybe a dozen reporters,
guys you know, too,

01:48.859 --> 01:50.443
who tell me they've been
pitching you this story

01:50.527 --> 01:52.320
for almost a year with no luck.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.323
Yeah, I'm not crazy
about being interviewed in print.

01:55.407 --> 01:59.076
Print journalists play it fast
and loose with exclamation points.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.121
"I love the news" becomes "I love the news!"

02:02.206 --> 02:03.915
Suddenly I'm deranged.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.958
- So why now?
- Huh?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.335
Why are you agreeing to this piece now?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.837
- You don't happen to have a cigarette?
- No.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.548
- Why now?
- Ah! Right here.

02:12.674 --> 02:13.925
Why do you want this now?

02:14.009 --> 02:17.053
I want some sort of document
about what we've been trying to do here.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.680
Like the king at the end of Camelot

02:19.765 --> 02:22.809
telling the boy to run behind the lines
from village to village

02:22.893 --> 02:24.143
telling people about, you know...

02:24.228 --> 02:25.645
- Camelot.
- Yeah.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.313
I'm asking why you reached out to me.

02:28.357 --> 02:31.108
Because, your recent
complications notwithstanding,

02:31.193 --> 02:32.777
you cover the media better
than anyone out there.

02:32.861 --> 02:33.861
You haven't lost your touch

02:33.946 --> 02:36.239
for complimenting and
insulting someone at the same time.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.742
Thank you. I appreciate it.
But it wasn't meant as an insult, Brian.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.327
Your life's been in news magazines,

02:41.411 --> 02:43.246
- and news magazines aren't...
- I know.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.705
...as many pages long as they used to be.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.249
What kind of access are we talking about?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.751
Here's what I'll offer.
You spend a few days here,

02:48.836 --> 02:50.962
talk to whoever you want,
but it's all off the record.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.339
- Not even background.
- What good does that do me?

02:53.423 --> 02:55.633
If I like how it feels, then we go ahead.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.679
But I still get to tell you what can retroactively
go on the record from the tryout period.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.473
- You're asking me to audition?
- Yeah.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.933
Why would I do that?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.268
I can think of some reasons.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.187
Four years ago, you were on
the masthead at Newsweek,

03:08.272 --> 03:10.106
turning out 10 cover stories a year

03:10.232 --> 03:12.024
and spending Sunday mornings on TV.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.609
Today you have a blog.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.653
Your fucking disdain for the Internet...

03:15.779 --> 03:18.114
Is matched only by
your fucking disdain for the Internet.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.700
You took a buyout when
Newsweekwas sold to IAC

03:20.784 --> 03:24.287
and rolled the money into a start-up,
thinking you'd be the next Huffington Post.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.371
How'd it work out?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.664
We filed for bankruptcy.

03:26.748 --> 03:31.127
The Sunday Times Magazine, Vanity Fair,
GQ, The New Republic, The Atlantic,

03:31.253 --> 03:34.046
everybody's offered the cover
and I get to pick the writer.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.883
I'm going with New York Magazine and you.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.302
So, you okay with the audition?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.304
Are you prepared to talk
about your Republicanism?

03:41.638 --> 03:42.722
You say that like I've got polio.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.140
Are you prepared to talk about having polio?

03:44.224 --> 03:48.561
I grew up in a town outside a town
outside Lincoln, Nebraska.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.770
My hometown was a road.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.565
I was a college freshman
before I met a Democrat.

03:52.649 --> 03:53.691
What about our history?

03:55.652 --> 04:01.574
Brian, your problem with me back in the day
was that I was a moderate, sane Republican

04:01.658 --> 04:04.660
who refused to take a position on anything
for fear I would lose viewers.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.954
Just as moderate,
sane Republicans on the Hill

04:07.039 --> 04:09.749
refuse to take a position
for fear they'll lose primary voters.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.960
I had a nightly rundown that went out
of its way to avoid reporting the news.

04:13.045 --> 04:17.798
And then MacKenzie McHale came along
and I'm attacking my own party

04:17.883 --> 04:19.675
for not standing up to its attackers.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.345
Isn't that what you wanted me to do
when you were calling me a coward?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.680
Yeah, but that's not
the history I'm talking about

04:24.806 --> 04:27.266
and you already knew that,
so please stop fucking around with me.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.605
One parenthetical sentence
in the second graph.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.191
"Full disclosure.
I've been a friend of MacKenzie McHale's

04:35.275 --> 04:37.234
- "since the late '90s."
- And you?

04:37.319 --> 04:42.239
An email went to 178,000 people
and was reported on our own morning show.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.700
That's all you know
and that's all you'll report.

04:45.869 --> 04:49.288
That's fine with me. But that's the last time
you'll tell me what I will or won't report.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.541
- I'm not your stenographer.
- Do we have a deal?

04:53.293 --> 04:56.045
Yeah, now why do you need someone
to run from village to village?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.296
Is something about to happen to Camelot?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.547
Maybe.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.217
First, you have to learn
what our whole philosophy is.

05:01.635 --> 05:05.471
Hang out, we'll talk later.
I have to go to a meeting with Reese Lansing.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.139
What's it about?

05:07.224 --> 05:09.433
Suspending our whole philosophy.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.727
Good to see you again, Brian.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.150
He should be here any minute.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.531
Sorry I'm late.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.866
All right, I'm not gonna tell you
what to put on the air.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.244
You're not allowed to tell us
what to put on the air.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.664
So I'm just gonna tell you the facts.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.166
You got mugged last week.
You got bludgeoned.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.253
- It's Casey Anthony.
- Hang on, wait. She may just be right.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.338
- We knew we'd take a small hit.
- There's nothing small.

05:39.423 --> 05:42.299
Let me just give you the facts and then
invite you to draw your own conclusion.

05:42.426 --> 05:45.845
Nancy Grace averages 283,000
viewers on HLN.

05:45.929 --> 05:50.516
Her time period competitor, News Night,
averages 960,000.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.686
One week ago, HLN begins coverage
of the Casey Anthony trial

05:53.770 --> 05:57.523
and Nancy's audience increases
to 1.5 million viewers,

05:57.607 --> 06:00.276
while News Night's audience
drops to 460,000,

06:00.360 --> 06:03.320
sending you from second to fifth place
in the course of five days.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.115
A feat I previously thought
was only accomplishable

06:06.199 --> 06:08.826
by the New York Mets.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.163
Whose idea was it to not cover
the Casey Anthony trial?

06:12.247 --> 06:13.664
It was mine.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.958
I think the three of you
should have a vaudeville act.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.878
I'm not kidding.
I'm gonna send you on a fucking tour.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.005
It was hers.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.467
MacKenzie, I've never seen a more
vivid picture of why viewers left,

06:24.593 --> 06:25.926
where they went to and why.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.178
You said why twice.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.096
You chose not to work for PBS.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.349
You chose not to work for NPR.
You have a ratings obligation.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.060
No, you have a ratings obligation.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.145
You're in business with the advertisers.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.521
I'm in business with the viewers.

06:37.606 --> 06:38.939
You just lost their business.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.739
That's all.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.325
Do what you want with the information.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.873
I'll not be taken down by this
psychotic cocktail waitress.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.959
That's right, we just keep playing our game,
wait it out and just...

06:59.044 --> 07:00.586
How long can the trial go on?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.630
I've seen the witness list.
It'll run around six weeks

07:02.714 --> 07:04.590
plus summations plus deliberation.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.093
- We'll never make it.
- That's right, so...

07:07.177 --> 07:09.095
Wait, when you said
we wouldn't be taken down

07:09.179 --> 07:10.888
by this psychotic cocktail waitress,

07:11.014 --> 07:13.599
did you mean we weren't
gonna cave or that we were?

07:13.683 --> 07:16.352
- You're gonna cover Casey Anthony.
- Bullshit we are.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.354
We have the three-day
weekend to gear up for it.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.522
Charlie.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.899
Starting Tuesday,
you'll lead with her in the A block.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.069
Give it 15 minutes and a five-minute reset
on the half hour.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.154
Seriously, I can't tell if you're joking or...

07:27.239 --> 07:28.239
- Did you just hear those numbers?
- Yes.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.033
Half our audience changed the channel
in one week.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.243
- I understand.
- Do you?

07:32.327 --> 07:35.329
- Do I understand math?
- Do you understand that it's unprecedented?

07:35.413 --> 07:37.832
I'm not gonna argue with you
when Will can do it for me.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.376
He's never gonna go for this. Tell him.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.003
Have marketing promo the living shit
out of Casey Anthony.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.130
Oh, my God.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.799
Rename the show "Casey Anthony Night
with Casey Anthony."

07:46.883 --> 07:48.634
- Will, hang on.
- Right here on the Casey Anthony Network.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.427
- Mac.
- 'Cause any second I'm going to wake up

07:50.554 --> 07:53.722
and be back in a room with Don Quixote
and the mission to civilize.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.807
- Listen to me.
- No.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.975
How many drinks were thrown in your face

07:56.059 --> 07:57.351
because you didn't think
people should watch

07:57.435 --> 07:59.520
The Real Morons of South Beach
or whatever the hell it's called?

07:59.604 --> 08:02.356
- It's not the same thing.
- It's exactly the same thing.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.859
It's just worse. A child is dead.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.236
A very troubled young mother
either did or didn't murder her.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.572
Her parents are waiting to find out if
she's going to get the needle,

08:09.656 --> 08:12.825
So thank God for TiVo,
otherwise we wouldn't be able to sit down...

08:12.909 --> 08:14.034
It's news.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.078
Yeah, say that three times
and click your heels.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.663
It's entertainment.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.416
And it's just, just this side of a snuff film.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.042
- Sit down, Mac.
- No, I don't want to sit.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.753
- Do it anyway, please.
- 15 at the top, that's a quarter of the show.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.714
- Mac.
- And five at the bottom for a reset?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.215
Please sit!

08:30.427 --> 08:32.178
- Think I like it?
- I know you don't.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.014
It makes me sick.
There isn't enough bourbon in Kentucky.

08:35.098 --> 08:37.349
Okay? We're in the same place on this.

08:37.517 --> 08:41.020
So, let's be in the same place on this.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.563
We've had ratings dips before.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.857
First of all, not like this. Nothing like this.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.358
Second, I want the debate.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.360
The three of us have talked
about a new debate format

08:48.445 --> 08:50.112
for months and
we're not going to be able to do it

08:50.238 --> 08:51.530
if they don't give us a debate.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.073
- I just really...
- They're not gonna give us a debate

08:53.158 --> 08:55.576
if we're in fifth place.
I want the debate.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.244
I want to fundamentally change the way

08:57.329 --> 08:59.246
we interview presidential
candidates for their job.

08:59.331 --> 09:02.833
If that means we have to be Jerry Springer
for a few weeks, I'm willing to pay that price.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.794
When the going gets tough,
the two of you really man up.

09:05.879 --> 09:10.591
Then go with your principles, Mac, but know
a ratings hit like this is all Leona needs

09:10.675 --> 09:14.136
to fire Will without having to explain why.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.441
- All right.
- You'll do it as classy as you can.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.110
I'll have Will wear a top hat and monocle

09:30.195 --> 09:33.239
while he's showing
pictures of the wet T-shirt contest.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.203
I'm sorry about the outburst in there.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.039
Yeah, I'm not sure it was
all about Casey Anthony.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.335
- How did it go?
- He's doing it.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.295
Then he has to disclose that we were...

09:48.380 --> 09:50.214
I told him one parenthetical
in the second graph.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.882
That's it.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.509
He needs to be seen
as a heavyweight again, Mac.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.427
He's not gonna write a tell-all. You're fine.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.432
Murrow did Person to Person.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.601
Celebrity interviews. It was a deal with Paley.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.353
One for them, one for him.

10:04.479 --> 10:08.107
He interviewed Liberace, Mac,
just so he could keep going after McCarthy.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.609
Those were puff pieces. This is poison.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.363
If we're gonna do this,
let's not pretend we're not doing this.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.827
- Jim Harper.
- Hey.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.453
- Brian Brenner.
- I know.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.789
I wasn't sure if you remembered.
It's been a few years.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.541
Sure. It's good to see you.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.085
Are you looking at BigGoverment. Com?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.670
- Yeah.
- Don't make me write

10:29.754 --> 10:32.631
that you're using Andrew Breitbart
to research this show.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.884
No, we're gonna be doing a mock debate
at the end of next week.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.136
A mock debate?

10:37.220 --> 10:40.139
The RNC is looking at Will
to possibly host a debate,

10:40.348 --> 10:42.975
and Will and Mac
have an idea for a new debate format.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.227
We want to show them,
so we're each playing a candidate

10:45.312 --> 10:48.480
and we're gonna do a mock debate
on Michele Bachmann, so...

10:48.565 --> 10:49.732
- Andrew Breitbart.
- Yeah.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.151
Tell me about this new
debate format you guys want.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.822
You know, I'm not really sure
what I'm allowed to talk to you about yet.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.991
Do you mind if we wait
until I get some instructions?

10:59.075 --> 11:00.117
- Sure.
- Thanks.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.207
Hey.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.542
- Hey.
- I heard you were here.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.752
You're not getting out of town
for the weekend?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.587
- Nope. How about you?
- Yeah.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.298
I'm going to a think tank
conference outside Baltimore.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.759
The Institute For Capital
Studies and Economic Growth.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.511
- It's gonna be a raver.
- I think it's called a rager.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.347
- Are you sure?
- No.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.390
It's either a rave or a rager or a raver.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.976
Don't think the Institute For
Capital Studies and Economic Growth's

11:26.061 --> 11:27.144
gonna be any of them.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.520
So I stopped in to give you a heads up.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.105
I might need a couple extra
minutes Tuesday night.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.607
I don't think I can give it to you.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.026
The House is going to vote
up or down on increasing the debt ceiling.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.487
- It's a cosmetic vote, but...
- If it's a cosmetic vote, why...

11:36.613 --> 11:38.155
It's news because first of all,
it'll be the first time

11:38.239 --> 11:40.949
in history the House lets
the US default on its debt.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.578
But moreover, it'll be the first shot
in the beginning of a very reckless,

11:44.662 --> 11:48.457
extremely dangerous partisan fight
that could end in catastrophe.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.167
- Let me explain.
- I can't give you the time.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.669
- If Congress doesn't raise...
- I can't give you the extra time.

11:52.796 --> 11:56.256
Starting Tuesday, I have
to cover Casey Anthony.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.969
- I really liked that we weren't doing that.
- I really liked it, too.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.263
By putting the debt ceiling
vote in the A block, we'd be sending...

12:03.348 --> 12:06.725
I can't, Sloan.
We lost half our audience last week.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.395
That's not hyperbole.
That's an actual number.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.980
- Half our audience went to HLN at 8:00.
- Half?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.691
If we don't bring them home this week,
we'll have lost most of them for good

12:14.776 --> 12:15.818
and we could lose the debate.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.072
Kenzie, I'm not just trying to get more airtime.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.490
This is an incredibly important...

12:21.616 --> 12:23.659
I had 42 and a half minutes to work with.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.202
I now have 22 and a half.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.079
Do you know how you're gonna
budget the 22 and a half?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.497
Do you know what Tuesday's news is?

12:28.623 --> 12:31.166
We want the debate. That's the prize.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.002
Those guys are studying
on a Friday night of a three-day weekend.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.630
- Okay, next question.
- Congresswoman Bachmann,

12:37.173 --> 12:39.633
you're a proponent of reforming
Social Security and Medicare.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.927
Can you give us some details of the reforms
you have in mind?

12:42.011 --> 12:45.139
I'd start by reducing benefits for all
but current recipients

12:45.265 --> 12:47.307
as part of an effort to
reduce the federal deficit.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.852
I'd like to add that President Obama
has already transferred

12:49.936 --> 12:53.147
over $500 billion out of
Medicare and into Obamacare,

12:53.314 --> 12:55.315
which I will repeal on my first day in office.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.193
Ms. Bachmann, are you aware that presidents
can't repeal laws?

12:59.154 --> 13:01.530
I, Jim, am aware of that, but...

13:01.614 --> 13:02.948
Where are you getting the quote?

13:03.032 --> 13:05.534
BigGovernment. Com. It's right here.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.371
- Hmm.
- What?

13:10.206 --> 13:12.583
Anthony Weiner's Twitter account got hacked.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.543
Can I suggest a way to
turn lemons into lemonade?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.627
Sure.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.005
First you squeeze the juice from the lemons.
Then add sugar and water.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.089
And you're not really into this joke,

13:19.215 --> 13:21.133
so I'm just going to say
what I really wanted to say.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.343
The Casey Anthony story
actually gives us a chance to show

13:23.428 --> 13:25.762
how important the debt ceiling
story is if we lead

13:25.847 --> 13:27.639
with the debt ceiling
instead of Casey Anthony.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.974
When do you have to go to your raver?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.143
- I've got plenty of time.
- Tea, can I have another?

13:31.269 --> 13:33.187
- Yeah.
- Hey, how about Brian Brenner?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.481
I've been reading him for years
and didn't know what he looked like.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.732
- He's cute.
- Yeah.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.275
- Is he single?
- He is.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.818
- Are you interested?
- Nope.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.154
That's contempt prior to investigation.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.324
No, it's contempt after
thorough investigation.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.242
- You dated him?
- I did.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.995
- When?
- About six years ago.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.705
That's... Wait.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.457
- That's...
- Yeah.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.753
Six years ago, you were
with the guy you were with before Will.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.047
Yeah.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.092
- But that would...
- Oh, my God, Sloan.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.636
It's like the land where time stands still.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.180
Brian Brenner is the guy
I cheated on Will with.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.685
I'd been with Will for a year
and Brian started calling me again.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.480
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.940
- Why would he do the piece?
- Brian?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.316
- Yeah.
- He needs a cover story.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.817
And why would Will have Brian do the piece?

14:20.902 --> 14:23.612
That's a perfectly fair question
to which I have no answer.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.031
This is really messed up.

14:26.115 --> 14:30.035
Look, I'll do my best to find you
the time you need for the story.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.579
We just need to hope there's
no new piece of nonsense

14:32.664 --> 14:37.376
I have to jam into my 22 minutes
of Short Attention Span Theater.

14:37.502 --> 14:41.547
Anthony Weiner accidentally tweeted
a picture of his groin to 40,000 followers.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.637
And I don't considerit
that big a federal offense,

14:48.721 --> 14:51.139
but people want to pay attention
to it and I guess I get it.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.058
When you're named Weiner,
it kind of goes with the territory.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.143
Have you ever taken a picture
like this of yourself?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.479
I can tell you this, that there are...

14:57.564 --> 14:59.231
I have photographs.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.858
I don't know what photographs
are out there in the world of me.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.695
I don't know what things have
been manipulated and doctored.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.364
And we're gonna try
to find out what happened.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.951
But the most important reason I want to
find out what happened is to make sure...

15:11.035 --> 15:14.621
Weiner, McAvoy. Call me.
You're getting terrible advice.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.293
Well, the choices are
to do something or to do nothing.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.671
If we do nothing, then the audience turns
to the nearest guy doing something.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.631
What exactly would our report be?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.883
That he's not answering questions very well?

15:27.051 --> 15:29.136
- I don't know. Give me three minutes.
- To report what?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.345
I don't know.
But if I do nothing,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.888
it's gonna look like I'm protecting a liberal.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.098
Since when did we start
caring about

15:33.182 --> 15:34.641
what it looks like
instead of what it is?

15:34.726 --> 15:37.644
Reports on the Tea Party won't have
credibility if we're not balanced.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.647
Will, you're the one who said that balance

15:40.732 --> 15:43.150
for its own sake doesn't
have any place in reporting.

15:43.401 --> 15:47.112
One from column A
and one from column B is bullshit.

15:47.196 --> 15:51.033
And boorish behavior isn't the same
as taking the US Treasury hostage.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.453
When the RNC boys come here on Friday,
they won't see it the same way.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.122
And you'll explain to them
we don't care that he's sexting.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.875
- We care how he votes.
- And they'll understand, give us the debate,

15:59.959 --> 16:03.253
let us use the format we want,
and we'll all go out for chocolate milkshakes.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.798
Three minutes in the B block, please,
after Casey Anthony.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.717
Okay.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.969
I know it seems like a story that only affects

16:11.054 --> 16:14.306
300,000 people in Queens,
but since there's sex involved,

16:14.390 --> 16:17.351
we can't deny its national importance.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.729
Especially since we don't know all
or even any of the facts.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.401
Three minutes.
I assume you want the pictures.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.821
Good meeting.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.704
I'm pretty familiar with that tone of voice.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.915
- I guess you are, too?
-  I am.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.588
No one's been hitting the Tea Party
as hard as you've been.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.840
- Certainly no Republican.
- That's not true.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.928
David Frum, Mark McKinnon, Alan Simpson,
Steve Schmidt, Andrew Sullivan.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.097
Okay, but none of them
work for Leona Lansing.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.099
I don't know.
I think everybody works for Leona Lansing.

16:57.475 --> 17:01.103
She can't be happy that you're beating
up people AWM needs on the Hill.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.814
I'm really not an expert on what
does or doesn't make Leona happy.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.191
Has she ever asked you to tone it down?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.068
I'm not doing your reporting for you, Brian.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.904
I'm doing my reporting myself.
I'm asking you a question.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.282
I'm not commenting on or off the record
about either Leona or Reese Lansing.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.494
- Does she want you fired?
- If she wanted me fired, I'd be fired.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.746
All she has to do is buy my contract,

17:19.831 --> 17:21.748
which she can do with the money
under her sofa cushions.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.625
But then she'd have to explain
why she was firing

17:23.710 --> 17:25.877
the second most watched anchor on cable

17:25.962 --> 17:27.796
and she can't do that.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.590
Is it a coincidence that
the tabloid stories about you

17:30.675 --> 17:31.967
started right after the election?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.136
I don't know.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.097
Do you think she's using
her own tabloid magazine

17:37.181 --> 17:38.974
to manufacture a reason to fire you?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.726
That would be a smart way to do it.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.019
And, of course, if you lost half your audience

17:43.146 --> 17:45.981
because your show was too highbrow
to cover Casey Anthony,

17:46.065 --> 17:47.941
she wouldn't even need
to work that hard to do it.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.653
Firing an anchor for losing half
his audience isn't unreasonable,

17:51.738 --> 17:53.071
if that's what you're asking.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.157
It wasn't and you know it.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.620
You're trying to get me to write
this story without your fingerprints on it.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.541
AWM has to do business with Congress
and you're making it much harder.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.502
Leona wants you fired,
but can't do it unless she can explain it.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.880
She's hoping the tabloid stories
build to a critical mass

18:09.964 --> 18:12.632
or that your ratings tank.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.177
Say something if I'm wrong,
say nothing if I'm right.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.349
For what it's worth, I'd cave, too.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.855
No serious journalist would ever agree
to the demands I made on Friday.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.191
So for what it's worth, you already did.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.321
Are you ready to answer
questions about the newsletter?

18:34.405 --> 18:36.531
- I haven't read it.
- The mock debate's Friday.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.366
No, I'm being Ron Paul right now.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.577
I didn't write it. I've never read it.
I've never heard of it.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.704
It's got my name on it,
I've made money from it.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.290
The newsletters would get
a standing ovation at a Klan rally,

18:45.374 --> 18:47.042
but you should stop asking me
questions about them.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.211
- You need a better answer.
- He needs a better answer.

18:49.921 --> 18:52.047
Tell you what question I'd start off with.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.840
- Congresswoman Bachmann.
- Yes?

18:53.925 --> 18:57.052
You've said that you were told
to run for president by God.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.012
- Please, I don't...
- You have, right?

18:59.096 --> 19:02.307
You've said on a number of occasions
that God told you to run for president.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.434
I have some clips here if you'd like me
to refresh your memory.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.186
- Nope, my memory is fresh.
- Here's my question.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.063
- Good.
- What does God's voice sound like?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.440
I'm completely serious.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.276
She's saying that God spoke directly to her.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.320
How is this not the first
question asked in a debate?

19:15.446 --> 19:17.072
How is it not the only question?

19:17.406 --> 19:19.908
What does his voice sound like?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.994
What did he say exactly, word for word?

19:23.079 --> 19:26.581
Did he speak in Hebrew?
Acadian? Kiswahili-Bantu?

19:26.707 --> 19:30.043
And to put it in a medical context,
is this the first time you've heard voices?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.712
She's claiming to be a prophet.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.714
The whole world is sitting
on the edge of their seat.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.842
How is this not the first question Will asks?

19:36.926 --> 19:40.262
First of all, can you stop pointing at me
and saying she and her?

19:40.346 --> 19:41.930
You're the one who wanted to play a woman.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.306
But tell me why that question is out of line.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.226
Because it's not the best way
to demonstrate seriousness of intent

19:46.310 --> 19:48.353
and it's not the best way to not insult people.

19:48.479 --> 19:51.106
- Which people?
- Christians. 83% of the country.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.275
I'm one of them. And she's insulting me.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.527
Please, stop pointing at me when you are...

19:55.611 --> 19:58.446
Relax, J. Edgar. She's insulting me,

19:58.614 --> 20:01.283
she's insulting my family,
she's insulting my congregation,

20:01.409 --> 20:02.951
and she's insulting my faith.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.120
She's implying that Christians are imbeciles

20:05.204 --> 20:07.497
who will believe anything while reducing God

20:07.623 --> 20:10.208
to a party hack who endorses
political candidates.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.670
Now, maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe this is the first time since Moses

20:13.754 --> 20:16.882
that God has given direct
instructions to someone other than his son.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.884
But if so, I think it deserves a follow-up.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.595
We're not going to get the debate
if we're mocking their candidates.

20:21.679 --> 20:25.682
The whole point of the new debate format
is to compel the candidates to tell the truth

20:25.808 --> 20:27.559
and make them responsible
for their own rhetoric

20:27.643 --> 20:30.395
by asking tougher questions
than a Match.com profile.

20:30.605 --> 20:34.190
If she knows what God wants,
then I'm voting for her.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.942
If she doesn't, she should stop saying so.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.403
I'm not attacking Christians.
I'm defending them.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.363
- All right.
- Just a moment, please.

20:40.448 --> 20:41.448
What?

20:41.532 --> 20:43.158
I'm standing up for the
tens of millions of Christians

20:43.242 --> 20:46.578
who are tired of being represented
by having our identity...

20:46.662 --> 20:48.496
There's been an identity theft.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.999
That's it. That's the one I want.

20:52.501 --> 20:57.047
I think you already know that starting tonight,
we're leading with Casey Anthony.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.341
Does anyone have a problem with that?

20:59.550 --> 21:02.302
All right, well, we lost almost
half a million viewers

21:02.386 --> 21:03.970
to Nancy Grace last week.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.181
Does anyone still have a problem with it?

21:06.641 --> 21:09.893
We're gonna clear out
some of these stories to make room.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.188
"Senate obstruction
becomes worst in US history."

21:13.272 --> 21:15.607
That's a report by the Alliance For Justice.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.443
The Senate's confirmed a smaller
percentage of Obama's judicial appointees

21:18.527 --> 21:20.528
than any other Senate
and any other president.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.948
No reason to care about that.

21:23.366 --> 21:26.493
"Job situation dire, new stimulus needed."

21:26.577 --> 21:29.371
This Congress ran on jobs,
but they're focused on debt.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.666
According to the payroll company ADP...

21:33.584 --> 21:35.502
I just solved unemployment.

21:35.586 --> 21:38.713
"AFL-CIO sours on Obama."

21:39.048 --> 21:41.299
We've got an analyst lined up
to give a report card

21:41.384 --> 21:42.467
on Obama's union relationships.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.261
Will the AFL-CIO still
be sour on him tomorrow?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.472
- I don't know.
- Let's find out.

21:48.265 --> 21:51.559
All right, to give us
a crash course in how best

21:51.644 --> 21:53.812
to exploit this tragedy
and to erase all boundaries

21:53.896 --> 21:55.772
of what should be used as entertainment,

21:56.399 --> 21:59.359
I've enlisted the help
of a master of the dark arts.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.902
I understand I'm needed.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.115
- Thank you.
- Forget everything you know about the news.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.075
Done. What's next?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.402
I'm Charlie Skinner.

22:42.820 --> 22:43.862
Good to meet you.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.197
Should I just sit here?

22:46.282 --> 22:48.450
Sure.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.869
Should I call you Mr. Hancock?

22:51.662 --> 22:53.079
It's Schneider.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.873
- Schneider?
- Ezra Schneider.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.292
How the hell many aliases do you have?

22:58.002 --> 22:59.169
I beg your pardon?

22:59.670 --> 23:00.879
Are you Late for Dinner?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.840
Mister, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.633
Charlie.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.972
That has to have been strange for you.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.892
That's going to be a story you'll tell later.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.146
Late for Dinner?

23:18.230 --> 23:21.149
- Solomon Hancock.
- Charlie Skinner.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.069
I thought because of the carnation.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.487
Did we say anything about a carnation?

23:25.571 --> 23:29.824
No, but it's usually the international sign for...

23:29.992 --> 23:31.242
Doesn't matter.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.453
I'm a busy guy
and if you're faffin' me around...

23:33.579 --> 23:35.455
Would you mind taking the battery
out of your cell phone?

23:35.539 --> 23:38.083
The walls in the New York Public Library
are three feet thick.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.334
That's why we're meeting here,

23:39.418 --> 23:41.419
but I'd like you to take the battery
out of your cell phone.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.630
You have reason to believe
you're under surveillance?

23:43.714 --> 23:46.007
Everyone's under surveillance.
If you've got a cell phone...

23:46.092 --> 23:47.759
It's talk like that that makes me...

23:47.843 --> 23:50.595
Did I or did I not establish
credibility on May 1 st?

23:50.888 --> 23:54.641
You correctly predicted that
we'd all be called to work, yes.

23:54.892 --> 23:57.435
Sometimes at the NSA,
we download a rolling bug

23:57.520 --> 24:00.814
onto smartphones to slave the microphone.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.275
You ever get an unwanted text message?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.194
All the time, but they're from my boss.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.656
Here.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.242
I'll never be able to put that back together.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.452
They're coming out with
a better model in six months.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.372
That's unusual for the tech industry.

24:18.332 --> 24:19.791
Can you tell me a little about yourself?

24:20.751 --> 24:23.419
I started out chasing around
a Soviet Pacific Fleet

24:23.546 --> 24:26.214
doing signal intelligence
cryptology for the Navy.

24:27.049 --> 24:30.927
But when the Berlin Wall
came down, my war was over.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.972
So I went into the private sector
like everybody else in the '90s,

24:34.056 --> 24:35.223
only not for a dot-com,

24:35.891 --> 24:38.893
doing data compression for fiber optics.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.396
Then 9/11 happened and I decided

24:41.564 --> 24:44.315
it was a good time to get back into
public service hunting bad guys.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.483
You're an IT guy.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.153
My title is Assistant Deputy Director

24:48.237 --> 24:51.781
of Technology and Systems Cryptology
and Mathematics at NSA.

24:56.537 --> 24:57.996
I'm gonna have to...

25:01.041 --> 25:02.625
I product-test software.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.879
- NSA software?
- Yes, sir.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.255
Can you tell me about the software?

25:08.966 --> 25:10.425
It's data mining.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.178
One of the ways the NSA
was tracking bin Laden,

25:13.262 --> 25:15.054
or any terrorist for that matter,

25:15.139 --> 25:19.934
was to write code that would sift through
millions of electronic communications

25:20.060 --> 25:22.312
looking for a needle in a giant haystack.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.523
You know the machine that Batman
uses in The Dark Knight

25:25.608 --> 25:27.942
to find the Joker, but when Morgan Freeman
finds out about it,

25:28.027 --> 25:30.987
he says, "I'm quitting because no man
should have this much power"?

25:31.947 --> 25:33.698
- No.
- "No" what?

25:33.782 --> 25:35.658
I do not know that machine.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.952
Well, it exists.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.997
We gave the contract to
two defense contracting big boys

25:41.123 --> 25:43.625
and it was my job mostly
to make sure that they delivered

25:43.792 --> 25:45.001
and that it worked.

25:45.127 --> 25:48.004
The project title is GLOBALCLARITY

25:48.339 --> 25:54.010
and it intercepts 1.7 billion phone calls,
emails, and texts every day.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.929
- Legally?
- By what standard?

25:56.138 --> 25:57.805
- The law.
- No.

25:57.973 --> 26:02.560
It involves a significant amount of illegal,
warrantless wiretapping of American citizens.

26:02.645 --> 26:08.233
Just to be... When you say "warrantless,"
are you saying "unnecessary"?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.526
"Without a warrant." Warrantless.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.154
We could hunt for terrorists legally,

26:13.239 --> 26:15.907
but due to our bosses'
devotion to GLOBALCLARITY,

26:15.991 --> 26:19.285
the NSA has been happily
violating the Fourth Amendment,

26:19.453 --> 26:21.496
USSID 18,

26:21.580 --> 26:26.000
and about a dozen of the NSA's
own regulations about spying on Americans.

26:26.085 --> 26:31.839
You've got guys listening in on ex-wives,
dropping in on calls from soldiers overseas,

26:32.091 --> 26:34.259
checking out what movie stars are up to.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.427
Am I the first person
you've talked to about this?

26:36.512 --> 26:39.847
No, stop confusing me with
Donald Sutherland in JFK.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.724
Well, a second ago,
you were Morgan Freeman.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.268
I have testified in front of Congress

26:43.352 --> 26:46.187
and to the Pentagon Inspector General.
I got nowhere.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.731
Nobody on the Hill wants
to admit it's fucked up

26:48.857 --> 26:52.568
because nobody wants to
be seen as post-9/11 soft.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.321
Where does AWM come in?

26:55.447 --> 26:57.907
Atlantis World Media
owns Atlantis Cable News.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.202
- Yeah.
- It also owns the tabloid TMI!

27:01.537 --> 27:04.080
- Yeah.
- The shit that's happening

27:04.164 --> 27:06.457
at Murdoch's News of the World in London,

27:06.542 --> 27:08.710
TMI! Has been doing the same thing for years.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.921
- How high does it go?
- I don't know.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.215
Does it go as high as Leona Lansing?

27:14.383 --> 27:16.009
- No.
- Good.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.553
It goes as high as her son.

27:19.471 --> 27:23.641
TMI! Is doing phone and computer hacking
and Reese Lansing knows?

27:24.184 --> 27:26.311
Reese has been ordering it.

27:26.395 --> 27:29.147
- I'm gonna give you...
- Hang on.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.732
I need to digest that.

27:32.026 --> 27:37.613
Reese Lansing is James Murdoch,
but Lansing's been ordering it.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.158
Digested yet?

27:45.205 --> 27:46.372
These classified?

27:46.457 --> 27:48.833
Yeah, because I'm dying
to violate the Espionage Act.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.419
These are just transcripts of my testimony

27:51.545 --> 27:54.088
before the House subcommittee
and the Pentagon.

27:54.423 --> 27:57.884
Vet me, vet the material.
Take all the time you need.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.844
Why are you whistle-blowing?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.931
I fought the Soviets.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.309
The way that government made
their people live their lives

28:06.393 --> 28:09.187
was a very good reason to fight them.

28:09.355 --> 28:13.733
After 9/11,
we started doing the exact same thing.

28:14.276 --> 28:18.029
I didn't spend my life fighting Communists
to have it come to this.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.449
Report on GLOBALCLARITY.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.701
And once I see that report,
I'll give you what you need

28:23.786 --> 28:25.620
to protect yourself from Leona Lansing.

28:25.996 --> 28:28.581
How do you know we need
protecting from Leona Lansing?

28:28.707 --> 28:31.334
Have you been listening? 'Cause we have.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.981
This woman is the best I've ever seen.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.566
Center screen is Nancy.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.777
These three corners are live feeds of
the guest experts.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.405
- What are they experts in?
- Agreeing with everything Nancy says.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.031
- But what keeps your attention...
- Excuse me.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.285
This is Brian Brenner, everyone.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.663
It's possible he's going to
be writing a feature on 2.0.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.124
But we're in a tryout period right now.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.291
Everything's off the record.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.544
Go ahead. What keeps our attention?

29:14.628 --> 29:16.003
Is the bottom right corner
where they're playing

29:16.088 --> 29:18.089
a loop of little Caylee from a home video.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.968
Hell. Do you think
it's as bad as everyone says it is?

29:22.469 --> 29:25.054
That was a tribute to Caylee.

29:25.139 --> 29:28.099
But how will they explain the duct tape

29:28.308 --> 29:30.685
around the child's mouth and nose?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.270
And how will they explain

29:32.354 --> 29:35.398
all the lies that Tot Mom told?

29:35.482 --> 29:37.108
Now they're not talking about the tattoo

29:37.192 --> 29:39.235
on Casey's back, but they put it full screen.
Why?

29:39.361 --> 29:41.028
Because Tess was just about
to look somewhere else,

29:41.196 --> 29:43.364
so they changed the frame
to anything that might keep her attention.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.450
He's right.
I was gonna google Mac's hell question.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.160
Plus tattoo equals bad mom.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.995
No one's ever gone broke
in America serving up

29:49.079 --> 29:50.663
a woman who makes other
women feel superior.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.832
The series of lies

29:52.916 --> 29:55.376
that finally came crashing down around her.

29:55.669 --> 29:56.961
If she would lie about that,

29:57.045 --> 29:59.964
why should I believe an accident is true?

30:00.048 --> 30:02.216
Don't spend time thinking
about her airtight syllogism.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.635
Her EP's showing duct tape and a plastic bag,

30:04.761 --> 30:07.513
so you know you're watching
Miami.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.140
...how to make weapons

30:09.224 --> 30:12.310
out of home materials found in the home.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.062
About breaking necks.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.814
How can they explain that?

30:16.899 --> 30:19.484
They can't explain it, Nancy.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.945
The defense is doing
what the defense has to do.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.406
Now, Bill Sheaffer has done his job.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.783
He agreed with Nancy.
We don't need to see his face anymore.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.911
Look how cute Caylee is.

30:30.204 --> 30:32.413
She deserved better than a mom with a tattoo.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.165
She deserved...

30:35.292 --> 30:37.168
- She deserved...
- Me.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.920
- Me.
- Me.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.464
Tess, how's that Google search coming?

30:41.590 --> 30:43.883
It does look pretty bad. A lot of fire.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.636
You'll notice little of her coverage
in this instance is about the law.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.930
You know, come to think of it,
I did notice that.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.264
It's all based on an emotional appeal.

30:50.390 --> 30:53.100
The way she would with a jury
if there was no judge there to stop her.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.852
Watch how she breaks down
courtroom footage.

30:54.937 --> 30:57.563
Liz, let's see the video of Tot Mom

30:57.648 --> 31:01.526
and Jose Baez back at it in court again today.

31:01.610 --> 31:06.030
Not a good look between
a death penalty defendant

31:06.323 --> 31:08.282
and the lead defense attorney.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.867
Two seconds.

31:10.452 --> 31:13.329
Two seconds of Casey Anthony
walking past her lawyer,

31:13.455 --> 31:15.623
and she'll show it to you in slow motion

31:15.707 --> 31:18.084
and from a different angle

31:18.168 --> 31:20.670
and at regular speed
and from the original angle again.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.964
- What does that remind you of?
- Instant replay in sports.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.382
And she looks pretty pissed at her lawyer.

31:24.466 --> 31:27.009
And that's exactly why she's showing it
to you so many times.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.554
So you have a chance to draw
your own thoroughly uninformed opinion

31:29.680 --> 31:31.305
about an utterly innocuous exchange.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.307
She looks pissed.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.601
"I wonder if she's sleeping with her lawyer.
I bet she is."

31:35.686 --> 31:37.812
"I wonder if that's what she looked like when
she killed Caylee."

31:37.938 --> 31:40.815
"This is the best TV ever. I've got to go
on my Casey Anthony Facebook page

31:40.899 --> 31:43.192
"and see if my Casey Anthony
Facebook friends just saw Casey Anthony

31:43.318 --> 31:45.194
"make a Casey Anthony face
at her Casey Anthony lawyer."

31:45.320 --> 31:47.905
All right, enough.
Will's a criminal prosecutor.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.157
Maybe he can talk about how
our justice system wasn't built

31:50.242 --> 31:51.576
to lock up guilty people.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.202
It was built to keep innocent people free,

31:53.287 --> 31:55.580
which is something Americans
should be proud of and fiercely protect.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.956
No.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.667
He can't ever imply that the viewer

31:59.751 --> 32:01.711
doesn't already know everything
and that she might be innocent.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.589
If we're gonna cover this,
we're gonna cover it our way.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.299
What's the point of covering
it at all unless we do it

32:06.383 --> 32:07.883
in a way that gets our audience back?

32:07.968 --> 32:11.596
A modest proposal.
We could ourselves commit murder on our air.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.806
In your face, Nancy Grace!

32:18.228 --> 32:19.312
How do we get the best guests?

32:19.396 --> 32:22.189
There's a guy you're gonna have to deal
with named Dylan Kagin.

32:22.316 --> 32:24.942
He's like the Broadway Danny Rose
of tabloid suffering.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.152
He's an agent?

32:26.236 --> 32:27.987
You ever ask yourself
why of all the missing kids

32:28.071 --> 32:29.614
and murdered coeds,
most of them go unnoticed

32:29.698 --> 32:31.616
- and some become national scandals?
- Sex appeal.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.827
Right, but someone's got to find
Lana Turner sitting at the drugstore counter.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.205
Dylan Kagin gropes through the trailer park
of American jurisprudence

32:38.290 --> 32:40.082
for what he calls "Oh, my God" stories.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.835
Then he drops in on the victims,
the accused, the jurors, the cops,

32:42.919 --> 32:44.920
whoever he can sell to the press,
the networks, and the studios.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.380
He packages the missing white girl.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.382
All right, that'll be the A block.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.842
By 2:00, show me where we are.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.218
The B block's gonna be Anthony Weiner,

32:51.303 --> 32:53.054
so, Jim, start putting something together.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.806
All we really have are the pictures
and Weiner not answering questions.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.100
- I know that.
- You don't want to wait until we have...

32:58.226 --> 33:00.519
Facts? No, that would be newsy and elitist.

33:00.604 --> 33:04.732
Let's just call them the A and the B block.
Let's just think of them as a polished,

33:04.816 --> 33:06.442
tightly produced abomination.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.736
I've been sitting here
and I'm getting a little sick of this.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.363
- You and me both.
- Jesus Christ.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.240
For a few weeks, we're not gonna
ask the country to eat its vegetables.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.576
Why? Because there's a debate we want to do

33:15.702 --> 33:18.371
that trumps all of your Sarah Lawrence
ethical conundrums.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.164
It shouldn't be too hard to understand.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.375
So get it the fuck together.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.545
He happens to be right.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.798
"War on drugs a failure."

33:29.800 --> 33:32.093
I know how it feels.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.264
Show me where we are at 2:00.

33:38.266 --> 33:40.935
- Mac, can I see you a second?
- Yeah.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.990
- Do you mind if I sit in on...
- Yeah, sorry, no.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.285
Not sure that's the best way
to get good press.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.080
May 1 st, the night we got bin Laden,
I got a call

34:01.164 --> 34:03.541
from an anonymous source at 7:30

34:03.625 --> 34:05.543
telling me the White House
would send an email blast

34:05.627 --> 34:08.045
to all the news agencies in 90 minutes,

34:08.130 --> 34:10.965
and obviously it turned out he was right.

34:11.133 --> 34:13.843
He was demonstrating his credibility.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.553
His name is Solomon Hancock.

34:15.637 --> 34:18.639
He works in software engineering at the NSA

34:18.765 --> 34:20.683
and he handed me a stack of documents,

34:20.767 --> 34:23.769
transcripts of his testimony
describing illegal surveillance.

34:23.854 --> 34:25.896
We have to start vetting
him and the documents.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.023
It's gonna take at least a few days,
but that's part one.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.275
What's part two?

34:29.359 --> 34:31.819
If we air his story, he'll give us evidence

34:31.903 --> 34:34.822
that TMI! 's been doing the same thing
as News of the World.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.617
- Hacking?
- Everything.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.579
- TMI! 's been hacking?
- Hancock says he's got the proof.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.998
Jesus Christ.
How high does he say it goes?

34:44.499 --> 34:45.499
Reese.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.086
- Let's get on with the vet.
- I'll have Jim run it.

34:49.171 --> 34:50.921
- Is he up for this?
- He is, Will.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.506
I taught him how to do the news.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.050
I taught them all how to do the news.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.428
Can you give us a second?

34:58.346 --> 34:59.430
I'm done.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.228
Why did it have to be Brian?

35:07.189 --> 35:09.774
Because I own him now.
He needs a cover story.

35:09.858 --> 35:13.527
If he writes a negative one, he'll get slammed
with the whole soap opera of our history.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.279
Are you lying right now?

35:15.363 --> 35:17.239
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

35:17.991 --> 35:21.535
Sloan says on Thursday, the House
is gonna vote to default on our loans,

35:21.620 --> 35:24.288
leading to a global economic meltdown.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.375
Should I put that before or after
Anthony Weiner in his underwear?

35:30.504 --> 35:32.963
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

35:41.223 --> 35:42.640
That's all for us tonight.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.558
Tomorrow we'll be bringing
you all the highlights

35:44.643 --> 35:47.561
from day seven of the trial
and Detective Yuri Melich,

35:47.687 --> 35:51.232
the first officer to interview
Casey Anthony in 2008.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.943
Terry Smith is coming up from Washington
with The Capital Report.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.236
I'm Will McAvoy.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.113
Good night.

36:06.748 --> 36:10.167
Will McAvoy,
your new choice for Casey Anthony coverage.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.752
- They're coming home.
- Yeah?

36:12.128 --> 36:13.420
We promoed the hell out of it.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.422
We got 150,000 viewers back.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.259
25-54, almost all women.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.553
That's toasters, furniture, food, clothes,

36:20.637 --> 36:22.680
kids' clothes, vacation plans.

36:22.764 --> 36:25.307
Our heads are above water now,
so do not stop.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.017
- We won't.
- How about this heat?

36:27.102 --> 36:29.144
- Yeah.
- 9:00 in the morning, it's already 87.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.105
It's gonna hit 98.
That would beat the record for this day

36:31.189 --> 36:34.024
- that was set in 1933.
- Yeah.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.734
- You're looking at me funny.
- Yeah?

36:35.819 --> 36:38.279
- I know you hate this.
- I'm looking at you the regular way.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.738
- If you say so.
- I do.

36:39.823 --> 36:42.825
There are also tornado warnings.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.661
- Reese.
- What?

36:46.037 --> 36:48.080
- Nothing.
- All right, so it's gonna get up to 98.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.458
That's a record. And there are tornado
warnings for New York City.

36:51.585 --> 36:53.669
Well, you know, Aunt Bee,
tornadoes are just God's way

36:53.753 --> 36:55.629
of destroying property and killing people.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.172
People like hearing about extreme weather.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.216
We're not doing a fucking
weather report, okay?

36:59.301 --> 37:01.093
We're not coming up with
some "Tornado Watch" graphic.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.636
We're a serious news organization.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.931
Tonight we'll be reporting on the killer
cocktail waitress and the congressman...

37:06.057 --> 37:08.225
- Is Mac bitching at you?
- Not nearly as much as she should be.

37:08.310 --> 37:11.228
I came in here to tell you
you got back 150,000 viewers

37:11.313 --> 37:12.813
you lost while you were trying to be above it.

37:13.273 --> 37:14.648
We'll be sure not to try that again.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.734
98 degrees is when we have power outages.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.402
Wait a second. Wait a second.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.362
I don't want to go all
conspiracy theory on you,

37:20.447 --> 37:22.823
but I think the heat might
be related to power outages.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.784
- Take it easy.
- Say hi to your mom.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.829
Will do.

37:29.539 --> 37:32.458
Visiting hours will be Tuesday and Friday.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.710
Don't be nervous.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.716
We got 150,000 viewers back last night.
Mostly women.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.217
- I know.
- I was telling her.

37:42.302 --> 37:45.054
You know, it's gonna get up to 98 degrees.

37:45.138 --> 37:46.847
Next person who tells me
about the damn weather...

37:46.932 --> 37:48.098
Do you know what you're doing here?

37:48.183 --> 37:50.225
I've been asked to tell you about the weather.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.354
Does it feel to you like anyone in this room
is in the mood for a joke?

37:54.272 --> 37:55.314
It absolutely does not.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.566
We want you to lead
the vetting of this source.

37:57.651 --> 38:00.861
He's telling us about illegal
surveillance at the NSA.

38:00.946 --> 38:04.990
He's also telling us that TMI! Is in the
same game as News of the World.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.242
Jesus.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.161
We're looking at
a couple of scenarios, Jim.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.747
One is that we're sitting on a scoop
that could shake up the NSA

38:11.873 --> 38:13.832
and maybe have the country
take another look at the Patriot Act.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.960
But the TMI! Element, doesn't that...

38:16.044 --> 38:18.379
Another is that someone's
trying to discredit us

38:18.463 --> 38:20.005
by having Will get Dan Rather-ed.

38:21.091 --> 38:25.135
You'll need to file a couple of hundred
Freedom of Information Act requests

38:25.220 --> 38:27.554
and you'll need to get into
this guy's personal life

38:27.639 --> 38:30.015
and you'll need to do it all

38:30.100 --> 38:33.102
without raising any flags at the NSA.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.062
Are you up for this?

38:39.234 --> 38:42.361
- Yeah.
- We don't need it fast, we need it right.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.822
- But we need it fast.
- I'll start mapping it out.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.573
Jim, since the day you started working here,

38:46.658 --> 38:49.326
I never felt the need
to remind you about confidentiality

38:49.411 --> 38:51.036
and I don't feel that need now.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.459
Okay.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.970
- Gotcha.
- Oh, God.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.222
- You feel like being interviewed?
- You read my mind.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.016
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do right now

39:12.100 --> 39:14.018
than be interviewed by my ex-boyfriend,

39:14.102 --> 39:15.352
except maybe eat my desk.

39:15.437 --> 39:17.438
- It seems like a bad week to be here.
- It is.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.774
I came here to write a story about how Will
and News Night changed overnight.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.693
- And then you changed overnight.
- Look.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.029
- The old Will all over again.
- These are extraordinary circumstances.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.947
That's what everyone says
when they abandon their principles.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.616
I'm no longer required
to live up to your standards.

39:30.744 --> 39:33.120
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.125
What's so special about this debate?

39:38.209 --> 39:39.960
If we get what we want,
no one will ever go back.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.545
We'll have changed the debates forever.

39:41.629 --> 39:44.631
And your concern is that if your ratings
are low, you'll lose leverage?

39:44.716 --> 39:47.134
- Yes.
- Is that your concern or Will's concern?

39:47.302 --> 39:48.844
Will's concerns are my concerns.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.972
'Cause another way of looking at it
is that he lost his invisible friends

39:52.098 --> 39:54.391
to Nancy Grace
and he's using the debate as an excuse

39:54.476 --> 39:55.642
to dumb the show down.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.437
That's a pretty bold statement from
a guy who's auditioning for a job.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.814
He's gonna give me the job,
and it's not like I don't know why.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.817
- Do you?
- I do because I'm not a fucking moron.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.236
The email that was read
by everyone in the world,

40:06.321 --> 40:09.531
"I cheated on Will."
You were talking about me, right?

40:13.036 --> 40:14.036
Yes.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.746
You were seeing Will while we were together?

40:15.830 --> 40:17.831
If you count drunk dialing me
at midnight and saying,

40:17.999 --> 40:20.834
"Just come on over and crawl into bed"
as being together, then yes.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.503
- I count it.
- Then yes.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.837
You cheated on me with Will?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.590
Let's be as clear as anyone
has ever been about anything.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.842
I cheated on Will with you.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.177
And I'm paying the price.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.346
I work 30 feet from the life I could have had

40:32.430 --> 40:33.931
if I hadn't been so stupid.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.974
And you're looking at
the life you could have had

40:36.101 --> 40:38.018
if you hadn't been a douchebag.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.066
How's the interview going so far?

40:45.068 --> 40:47.027
Is douchebag one word or two?

40:47.112 --> 40:49.113
Come in.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.449
- Sorry, I can come back.
- No, what do you need?

40:55.203 --> 40:58.705
Well, there's a story I'd like to pitch.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.792
Brian, this is Neal Sampat.
Neal writes Will's blog.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.378
- Will doesn't write Will's blog?
- Will can't find Will's blog.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.381
Neal wants to be a producer,
so from time to time,

41:07.465 --> 41:09.842
he pitches stories. What do you got?

41:10.218 --> 41:11.426
You know what a troll is, right?

41:12.053 --> 41:13.846
A tiny creature that stands under a footbridge

41:13.930 --> 41:16.223
and makes you answer a riddle
before you're allowed to pass.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.183
- They're not real, man.
- I know that.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.560
He means the other kind of troll.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.812
You don't have the first clue what he means.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.772
I mean the other kind of troll.

41:23.857 --> 41:25.149
A little backup would have killed you?

41:25.233 --> 41:27.651
Sorry, Internet trolls.
It's a play on a fishing term.

41:27.777 --> 41:28.819
People who go to message boards

41:28.903 --> 41:30.988
and try to hijack the conversation
by being incendiary.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.198
- What about them?
- Turns out they have their own websites.

41:33.283 --> 41:35.742
Like an online clubhouse.
And to be accepted into the group,

41:35.827 --> 41:37.953
you have to be able to point
to a successful incident of trolling,

41:38.037 --> 41:41.081
a recent time when you made
a whole bunch of posters lose their minds,

41:41.166 --> 41:43.876
or better yet, got the site
monitor to shut down the board.

41:44.294 --> 41:46.795
Actually, I like it.
And it's not about bigfoot.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.256
Write this down, News Night
is gonna break the story on bigfoot.

41:49.507 --> 41:52.176
We're not. Don't write that down.
Will they talk to you?

41:52.260 --> 41:55.429
They won't talk to a reporter,
but I thought maybe I'd try to get in there.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.891
Undercover? Aren't you gonna
have to say you trolled something?

41:58.975 --> 42:01.435
I'm not gonna have to say it,
I'm gonna actually have to do it.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.020
To who?

42:03.313 --> 42:06.481
Well, I don't want to ding on
an innocent person for a story,

42:06.566 --> 42:07.608
so I'm gonna have to do it to one of us.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.109
You'd have to be anonymous on our website.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.527
No, I mean do it to us on another website.

42:10.612 --> 42:13.155
- What would it be?
- I don't know yet.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.908
Come back when you know,
but you've made it past the first hurdle.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.994
Thank you.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.040
- Sloan.
- How's her mood in there?

42:23.124 --> 42:26.376
It's not good, but let me ask you something.

42:26.461 --> 42:27.961
For the sake of a story,

42:28.588 --> 42:31.965
how would you feel about me going on
the Internet and saying vicious things

42:32.050 --> 42:34.259
about you that might get an argument
started about misogyny?

42:34.344 --> 42:37.054
- What kind of vicious things?
- I don't know.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.431
- What would the general area be?
- I really don't know.

42:39.515 --> 42:42.184
- Something about the way you look?
- Like what?

42:42.268 --> 42:44.478
- I'd be making it up.
- What would you be making up?

42:44.562 --> 42:47.606
It wouldn't be true. It'd be something like...

42:47.732 --> 42:50.692
Something along the lines of,
"She screwed her way to the top

42:50.985 --> 42:53.612
"and she's got a big ass."
Only it would have to be...

42:53.696 --> 42:54.947
Listen to me, Sampat.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.659
- Do I?
- Of course not.

43:01.496 --> 43:04.122
Okay.

43:04.207 --> 43:05.624
- I can do it?
- You cannot.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.834
If you want, you can say that
I made it to the final round

43:07.919 --> 43:10.045
of the K-through-six regionals
in the Scripps Howard Spelling Bee.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.839
That's not gonna help me.

43:13.007 --> 43:16.176
You know, a lot of guys like women with big...

43:17.303 --> 43:18.929
Do they really?

43:19.013 --> 43:20.138
Never mind.

43:20.223 --> 43:24.184
I don't know what you're talking about
and I have my own problems.

43:29.524 --> 43:30.899
- Jim.
- Yeah?

43:30.984 --> 43:32.567
I got a woman on the phone
who says she's got some tweets

43:32.652 --> 43:34.152
from Anthony Weiner and wants to talk to us.

43:34.654 --> 43:36.822
- What are you telling me for?
- Seniority?

43:36.906 --> 43:40.158
Well, I'm handing her off to
the next most senior person.

43:40.243 --> 43:41.785
Kendra, take the Weiner girl.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.037
- Gary, take the Weiner girl.
- Tess.

43:44.205 --> 43:47.416
- Tamara.
- We were hired as interns the same day.

43:47.500 --> 43:50.335
I was hired in the morning. You were hired
after lunch. Take the Weiner girl.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.129
Please, don't make me
take the Weiner girl.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.714
Respect the seniority.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.799
Who do I have seniority over?

43:57.510 --> 43:59.011
Maggie.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.515
- Can people still see me?
- On five.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.981
Hi, this is Margaret Jordan.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.191
I'm an associate producer at News Night.

44:13.276 --> 44:15.736
Okay, can you spell that for me?

44:16.904 --> 44:18.947
Okay, wait.

44:19.032 --> 44:20.032
Hang on.

44:20.116 --> 44:22.409
No, you're gonna get a chance.

44:25.038 --> 44:28.081
Well, you certainly seem to
want to share your story.

44:29.751 --> 44:31.668
You really can't just drop in on a doctor.

44:31.753 --> 44:34.004
- What if it's an emergency?
- You go to the emergency room.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.089
They don't have
psychiatric emergency rooms.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.300
They should. You're a good reason why.

44:38.885 --> 44:41.470
- You want a piece of me?
- Seriously?

44:41.554 --> 44:43.555
- No.
- Yeah.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.227
Does he look over at the red light?

44:49.312 --> 44:50.520
Does he look every few minutes?

44:50.605 --> 44:53.565
If I was your therapist,
I'd definitely look every few minutes.

44:54.776 --> 44:56.068
Hey, hey, you can't do that.

44:56.152 --> 44:58.528
It's okay. He likes me.

44:59.781 --> 45:00.906
- Will.
- I'm sorry.

45:00.990 --> 45:02.491
- I'm with a patient.
- I really just need a second.

45:02.575 --> 45:05.369
I'm glad to see you back here, but you
need to come during your appointment.

45:05.453 --> 45:06.453
I could be dead by then.

45:08.706 --> 45:09.998
Are you having suicidal thoughts?

45:10.083 --> 45:11.166
- No.
- Then why did you say that?

45:11.250 --> 45:13.877
- Just to get your attention.
- I'm going back to my patient.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.380
Listen to me.
I've been paying 250 a session for four years

45:16.464 --> 45:17.756
without showing up to a single session.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.841
You owe me $100,000 worth of therapy.

45:19.926 --> 45:22.677
I'll forgive the debt, we'll be totally square,
just give me one minute.

45:26.474 --> 45:28.892
I'm sorry. I'll be just a minute.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.270
You caved for the money.
I'm kind of disappointed.

45:32.397 --> 45:35.315
I didn't cave for the money.
You're getting the sessions you paid for.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.484
You seem like you're in pain.

45:37.819 --> 45:40.404
- He is.
- He said "in pain," not "a pain."

45:40.488 --> 45:41.822
Oh. Never mind, then.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.241
What is it?

45:44.325 --> 45:47.119
I'm doing all these things that are wrong
because of ratings,

45:47.203 --> 45:49.371
and I'm making the staff do things
that they don't want to do,

45:49.497 --> 45:53.125
I'm cursing them out, I'm ignoring incredibly
important news stories,

45:53.251 --> 45:55.043
and I'm betraying the trust
of people who respect me.

45:55.169 --> 45:57.379
And I did it all in the blink of an eye.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.548
- That can be traumatic.
- No, I'm fine with all of that.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.842
Here's my thing. New York Magazine

46:02.009 --> 46:04.261
is gonna do a story on my show
and I get to choose the writer.

46:04.345 --> 46:07.973
And I could have chosen anybody
and I chose MacKenzie's ex-boyfriend.

46:08.683 --> 46:10.142
Of course.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.353
- The one she cheated on you with?
- Yeah.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.272
- Why?
- That's what I came here to ask you.

46:15.356 --> 46:17.566
You're holding your hand over the candle.

46:17.650 --> 46:18.608
What do you mean?

46:18.693 --> 46:22.737
You're holding your hand over the candle
because you think the trick is not minding.

46:24.532 --> 46:25.574
Ahh.

46:25.658 --> 46:28.743
So if I just get through this, I'll be fine.

46:28.870 --> 46:30.912
- No.
- Why?

46:31.205 --> 46:33.123
Because the trick isn't not minding.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.084
The trick is forgiving MacKenzie.

46:36.169 --> 46:38.044
It would be easier
to hold my hand over the candle.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.838
I know.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.884
Well, you've been no help at all, but thanks.
Sorry to barge in.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.802
You know, while you're
working your way through this,

46:45.887 --> 46:47.387
you're hurting MacKenzie.

46:48.806 --> 46:49.806
I know that.

46:51.392 --> 46:53.643
Show up for your appointment.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.733
I'm not doing it on purpose.

47:04.197 --> 47:05.489
Maggie.

47:07.074 --> 47:09.075
Yeah.

47:12.788 --> 47:13.955
- Sandy?
- Yes.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.249
- Margaret Jordan. We talked on the phone.
- Nice to meet you.

47:16.459 --> 47:17.667
- You got here okay?
- Yes.

47:17.752 --> 47:20.003
I have a receipt for the cab.
Who do I give that to?

47:20.087 --> 47:21.755
I'll take it.

47:23.382 --> 47:26.218
So, you got some tweets
from Congressman Weiner.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.512
And I've got copies of them right here.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.267
"'I like the cute new pics of you.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.061
"'Where'd you get those abs? '

47:36.187 --> 47:39.272
'Glad you like them.
When do I get to see your swimsuit shot? '

47:39.899 --> 47:42.776
'When are you coming to see me?
Or just coming? '

47:43.194 --> 47:44.861
'Make me an offer.'

47:44.946 --> 47:47.197
'My door's always open. Get it? '

47:47.281 --> 47:49.241
'What's your plan for us? '

47:49.325 --> 47:52.786
'To get us in the mood,
we watch The Daily Show and Colbert.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.663
"'Then when we're really hot,
we go to the bookstore

47:54.747 --> 47:56.414
"'and replace all the copies
of Glenn Beck books

47:56.582 --> 47:59.125
"'with The Audacity of Hope.
Or, if that's not your thing,

47:59.210 --> 48:01.503
"'we can just get drunk and fuck."'

48:08.302 --> 48:09.594
Why are you doing this?

48:09.679 --> 48:11.346
Because the world needs to know
what kind of guy he is.

48:11.681 --> 48:15.350
It sort of seems like you
were a willing participant.

48:15.476 --> 48:16.893
I didn't know about the other women.

48:16.978 --> 48:18.645
- Did you know he was married?
- Of course.

48:19.272 --> 48:21.481
I just didn't know about the other women.

48:21.732 --> 48:25.443
I was fooled and I think the world needs
to know what kind of guy he is.

48:25.820 --> 48:28.989
By any chance, have you heard
of a guy named Dylan Kagin?

48:29.615 --> 48:30.991
He's gonna be my agent.

48:31.951 --> 48:33.827
Sandy... Can I call you Sandy?

48:33.953 --> 48:35.328
Sure.

48:35.413 --> 48:38.790
Sandy, the congressman is in a lot of trouble.

48:38.874 --> 48:40.166
He got himself into it

48:40.251 --> 48:43.336
and he's probably not gonna
be able to get out of it.

48:45.256 --> 48:48.341
Are you sure you want to pile on?

48:49.302 --> 48:51.761
I think people need to know
what kind of person he is.

48:51.846 --> 48:53.597
All right.

48:55.933 --> 48:58.101
Would you like to be on our show tonight?

48:58.185 --> 49:00.687
That's the thing.
I'm doing Access Hollywood, ET, and Fox.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.315
The big three. No problem.

49:03.482 --> 49:06.067
We can do a pre-tape in a few minutes.

49:06.235 --> 49:08.153
You're a lifesaver.
I was hoping you'd say that.

49:08.237 --> 49:10.196
No kidding? Stay here

49:10.364 --> 49:13.867
and I'll talk to my EP and we'll get this going.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.619
Could I possibly get a decaf latte?

49:15.745 --> 49:19.497
You cannot possibly get that,
but I'll have someone bring you a coffee.

49:26.047 --> 49:28.506
Well, I left it for you
on the left side of the desk.

49:28.591 --> 49:31.217
And, yes, I signed it. Here you go.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.011
I don't know anything about it.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.430
Leona!

49:35.723 --> 49:37.015
A word?

49:37.099 --> 49:39.267
Okay, ask her to show it to me on the plane.

49:40.770 --> 49:42.937
Let's not stand in the street.

49:43.564 --> 49:46.358
Charlie, with that bow tie,
you look like a balloon salesman.

49:46.442 --> 49:48.693
No, I get in the car and get out a minute later,

49:48.778 --> 49:52.906
it looks like we're talking about a problem
or making a drug deal.

49:54.116 --> 50:00.246
We're gonna stand here, smile and nod,
and do this and laugh.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.959
We know where the tabloid stories
are coming from.

50:05.795 --> 50:07.212
They're coming from reality.

50:07.296 --> 50:10.256
Only if you define reality as fantasy,

50:10.383 --> 50:12.550
and they're appearing
in a magazine you own.

50:12.677 --> 50:14.928
How would it look if I had
one of our news magazines

50:15.054 --> 50:16.638
go soft on our flagship anchor?

50:16.764 --> 50:19.349
We're calling TMI! A news magazine?

50:19.433 --> 50:21.976
People need to know if Taylor Swift is happy.

50:22.103 --> 50:23.937
I provide a public service
for hundreds of thousands.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.730
The public's grateful.

50:25.815 --> 50:28.441
What did I tell you
the day after election night?

50:28.776 --> 50:32.612
Friend to friend,
I'd stop coming after Will in the tabloids.

50:32.863 --> 50:36.616
I told you to get him to lighten up
on the Tea Party

50:36.742 --> 50:40.829
or a context would be created
whereby his firing would look reasonable.

50:40.913 --> 50:43.915
- You need to hear me.
- I don't think I do.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.709
The 112th Congress wasn't even seated

50:45.793 --> 50:49.129
and he took the Tea Party out for a walk
on the 9/11 Responders Bill.

50:49.255 --> 50:52.507
Congress, Democrats and Republicans

50:52.633 --> 50:56.010
spent eight years using 9/11 as a justification

50:56.137 --> 50:58.722
for everything from tax cuts
to a foreign invasion.

50:58.806 --> 51:02.058
So Will questioned their change of heart

51:02.143 --> 51:04.477
when it came to the police
and firemen's unions.

51:04.562 --> 51:06.646
You made them look like hypocrites.

51:07.022 --> 51:08.273
By rolling tape.

51:08.357 --> 51:13.820
House Financial Services, insider trading,
Keystone XL, Joe Walsh, Allen West,

51:13.946 --> 51:16.406
Paul Ryan, and who am I forgetting?

51:16.866 --> 51:20.493
Oh, yes. Charles and David Koch.

51:20.911 --> 51:22.328
Keep smiling.

51:22.413 --> 51:24.831
We lost a couple of
awfully helpful tax loopholes

51:24.915 --> 51:26.791
that were tailored to assets overseas.

51:26.876 --> 51:30.211
And the FCC won't even let us bid
on the coming spectrum auction

51:30.463 --> 51:32.255
because they want a full report
on whether or not

51:32.339 --> 51:34.174
we're skirting antitrust.

51:36.093 --> 51:38.344
So what was your request again?

51:38.429 --> 51:40.555
You don't want to do this.

51:41.348 --> 51:43.433
I don't.

51:43.517 --> 51:44.934
I really don't.

51:45.019 --> 51:46.728
But I have to and I will.

51:46.812 --> 51:49.898
And friend to friend,

51:50.274 --> 51:53.109
you let him know that he is
one tabloid fuck-up

51:53.194 --> 51:56.529
and a ratings point away
from having his own podcast.

51:57.782 --> 52:00.033
I have to make my plane.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.373
Fly safe.

52:22.932 --> 52:25.058
- Unless there's a rally...
- I'm sorry, I've got to...

52:25.142 --> 52:26.226
- Listen.
- Sloan.

52:26.352 --> 52:27.977
Unless there's a rally in the next 90 minutes,

52:28.062 --> 52:33.024
the Dow's gonna close down about 2.5%,
S&P and NASDAQ will close down 2.3.

52:33.108 --> 52:35.068
- Let me tell you why.
- I don't own a lot of stock.

52:35.152 --> 52:36.361
- Let me tell you why.
- I really can't...

52:36.445 --> 52:37.946
Stop avoiding this!

52:38.030 --> 52:39.697
I just got off the phone with these guys.

52:39.782 --> 52:42.033
Listen to these quotes.
These aren't from liberals.

52:42.117 --> 52:44.953
These are hardcore Wall Street guys
who, whatever the world may think of them,

52:45.079 --> 52:46.996
know what they're talking about and so do I.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.415
Jamie Dimon at Chase says,

52:49.500 --> 52:52.502
"Voting against raising the debt ceiling
would be a moral disaster."

52:52.586 --> 52:56.214
The Barclays guys say,
"This debate is detached from reality."

52:56.382 --> 53:00.385
My Goldman source says, "If the
House Republicans continue this debate,

53:00.469 --> 53:05.431
"I hope they're willing to mark the end
of the dollar as a global reserve currency."

53:05.641 --> 53:06.850
Please notice that he didn't say

53:06.934 --> 53:09.602
"If the House Republicans
don't raise the debt ceiling."

53:09.728 --> 53:13.606
He said, "If the House Republicans
continue this debate."

53:15.609 --> 53:18.319
That's all it takes.
Just the uncertainty.

53:18.404 --> 53:22.615
That's why the Dow's gonna
close down 230 points today.

53:22.700 --> 53:25.326
Because just the debate, just the doubt,

53:25.411 --> 53:27.912
just the possibility that the House Majority
might commit

53:28.038 --> 53:30.498
the most self-inflicted damage to the country

53:30.624 --> 53:35.086
since the secession of the South
has caused billions in value to disappear.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.255
Sloan, I understand. I swear to God I do.

53:37.339 --> 53:39.173
But you can't say the same
thing in the C block?

53:39.258 --> 53:40.884
You know that most
people watch 10 minutes of news,

53:40.968 --> 53:42.886
- the first 10 minutes.
- The vote isn't until tomorrow night.

53:42.970 --> 53:45.013
And it's only the first vote.
You said yourself it was cosmetic.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.306
Why do we have to feature it tonight?

53:46.432 --> 53:47.640
We should have been featuring it weeks ago.

53:47.808 --> 53:49.851
Why do we have to feature it tonight?

53:49.977 --> 53:52.145
To give time for the people
to call their congressmen

53:52.271 --> 53:56.149
and say, "If you fuck with the full faith
and credit of the US Treasury, you're fired."

53:56.567 --> 53:59.903
To give time for the people to jam
the phone lines of the district offices.

53:59.987 --> 54:02.238
To give the people time to say,

54:02.740 --> 54:03.948
"I'm a fiscal conservative

54:04.033 --> 54:07.535
"and you've got to put the pin back in
the grenade right now."

54:08.454 --> 54:09.996
That's why.

54:13.167 --> 54:15.168
I'm gonna do everything I can.

54:15.502 --> 54:17.420
Please do.

54:23.302 --> 54:24.802
Don't worry about it.

54:24.887 --> 54:27.055
She's just frustrated because
she can't get the word out

54:27.139 --> 54:29.515
that this is a global
emergency unless you let her.

54:31.977 --> 54:34.604
Appreciate your clearing that up.

54:34.688 --> 54:36.397
You know what, MacKenzie?

54:38.484 --> 54:40.443
I'm not the one who put me here.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.446
Say what you want about me,
but I wouldn't have done that.

54:56.752 --> 54:58.086
Does Will have the questions?

54:58.170 --> 55:00.046
Tess is giving him some cards now.

55:03.550 --> 55:05.718
- Is that lighting okay for you?
- Yeah.

55:05.803 --> 55:08.096
- How are we Chyroning her?
- I was gonna ask you.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.140
Figure it out later.

55:15.980 --> 55:17.647
- Sandy.
- Yes?

55:17.731 --> 55:20.441
My name's MacKenzie. I'm the executive...

55:22.653 --> 55:24.445
I'm the executive producer of News Night.

55:24.571 --> 55:26.322
- Can you hear me okay?
- Yes.

55:26.407 --> 55:29.242
Okay. Thanks for being patient with us.

55:29.326 --> 55:33.705
Will's just throwing on a jacket and tie
and we'll be able to do this.

55:34.540 --> 55:37.041
- Real easy.
- You got it.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.012
Hi, I'm a big fan.

55:50.431 --> 55:51.431
Hmm?

55:51.515 --> 55:52.557
I'm Sandy.

55:52.641 --> 55:54.767
How do you do?

55:55.144 --> 55:57.228
- Are we ready for the pre-tape?
- Yeah.

55:57.354 --> 55:59.105
- Just count me down.
- Will.

55:59.189 --> 56:01.315
Yes, I'm sure I want to do this.

56:01.442 --> 56:04.902
God, please give me a sign
I'm not doing a big thing badly.

56:12.036 --> 56:13.161
We just lost power.

56:13.287 --> 56:15.621
The whole building just lost power.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.249
I didn't know he had
that kind of comic timing.
