bought that new car stereo

you always take
the long way to work.

come and get it?"

When he opens the door that’s
when we spring into action.

09:06.913 --> 09:10.316
I will freeze him in his
tracks with the bullhorn.

You’re under arrest.

with the rope, tie him up.

to hold the bullhorn?

have to go back in the house.

Did you just do
what I think you did?

12:11.064 --> 12:14.300
That depends on
what you think I just did.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.206
Did you just shut the trunk?

Well, of course, I did.
Don’t be ridiculous.

we’re dealing with.

to know we’re in here.

locked us in the trunk.

Cousin, I just had
the most horrible thought.

before we run out of oxygen.

I, I saw this once
on "Star Trek."

12:47.267 --> 12:48.434
It wasn’t pretty!

12:48.468 --> 12:52.472
The Klingons had taken control
of the life‐support system

12:52.506 --> 12:55.542
of the Enterprise and the crew
were running out of oxygen.

12:55.576 --> 12:57.210
And Captain Kirk said...

12:57.243 --> 12:59.379
"Scotty...

12:59.412 --> 13:01.114
You’ve got to
get us out of here."

13:04.918 --> 13:06.352
And Scotty said...

13:06.386 --> 13:08.388
"Captain, I‐I can’t give
you any more power.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.060
"We’re out of
dilithium crystals.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.496
I need more time" and then...

13:16.530 --> 13:18.098
...and then Bones said...

13:18.131 --> 13:20.901
"Damn it, Jim,
I’m a doctor, not a machine!"

13:25.539 --> 13:28.909
Balki...let me tell
you somethin’, okay?

13:28.942 --> 13:31.377
Nothing uses up oxygen
faster than talking.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.913
So why don’t you shut up?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.051
We are not gonna
run out of oxygen.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.886
‐Yeah, well‐‐
‐The trunk is not air tight.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.187
Now, we are just gonna
sit here until they

13:41.221 --> 13:42.956
steal the radio and leave.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.391
And then we’re gonna
call for help.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.893
[car doors opening]

13:48.294 --> 13:49.963
[car doors closing]

13:49.996 --> 13:51.397
Alright, they’re in the car.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.465
[engine cranking]

13:56.369 --> 13:58.204
Oh, my Lord!

14:00.140 --> 14:02.175
They are stealing
the entire car.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.478
Well, at least you
won’t have that big, ugly hole

14:05.512 --> 14:07.514
in the dashboard.

14:07.548 --> 14:09.215
[trembling]

14:09.249 --> 14:11.084
[dramatic music]

14:13.520 --> 14:15.488
Alright, they drove
for about ten minutes...

14:15.522 --> 14:18.291
...then they slowed down,
then they stopped.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.327
I think they stopped
at Bugsy’s Burgers.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.530
I think you’re right, cousin.

14:23.564 --> 14:26.266
That was definitely the smell
of Bugsy’s French fries.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.537
I think I have a pretty good
idea where we are.

14:30.571 --> 14:32.639
Well, so do I...

14:32.673 --> 14:34.340
We’re in the trunk.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.311
I mean...

14:38.344 --> 14:41.047
I think I know where
they’ve taken us.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.516
[tires screeching]

14:42.549 --> 14:44.518
Yeah, yeah, see!

14:44.551 --> 14:48.522
That turn would put us on
the Old Mill Road, sure.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.423
Out in the middle of nowhere.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.061
[engine revving]

14:57.163 --> 14:59.165
Sure, I think they’re
gonna strip the car

14:59.199 --> 15:01.034
and abandon it in the woods.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.368
[tires screeching]

15:03.637 --> 15:05.271
You know what, cousin?

15:05.305 --> 15:06.607
It’s bad enough
they stole the car

15:06.640 --> 15:08.909
but they haven’t used
the turn signal once.

15:11.512 --> 15:14.480
I guess crime poisons
every part of you.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.418
Now, look, we gotta
figure out a way outta here.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.320
See if you can find the jack.

15:22.723 --> 15:25.425
‐What?
‐The jack, the jack.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.594
Cousin, I...I’m pretty sure

15:27.628 --> 15:29.596
we’re the only two people
that got in this car.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.535
I’ll, I’ll look for him
if you want me to.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.403
Jack!

15:40.006 --> 15:42.075
Jack!

15:44.244 --> 15:47.413
I mean,
see if you can find the tool

15:47.447 --> 15:49.683
we use to prop up the car
when we change the tire.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.488
Oh, I got it.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.725
Here you go.

15:58.759 --> 16:01.394
Do, do you want me to
stop looking for the man?

16:03.229 --> 16:04.698
Yes, yes, alright, now!

16:04.731 --> 16:06.199
I think I can use the jack

16:06.232 --> 16:07.701
to pop the lid of the trunk.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.102
Change places with me.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.037
No!

16:11.071 --> 16:12.238
I’m not gonna
change places with you.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.640
I like my place right here.

16:13.674 --> 16:16.109
I got my, I got it all
just the way I want it.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.443
‐Change places with me.
‐No, I’m not gonna change‐‐

16:17.477 --> 16:18.612
‐Oh!
‐Get out of the way!

16:18.645 --> 16:20.413
[indistinct chatter]

16:20.446 --> 16:22.482
‐Get out of the way!
‐No. Ow!

16:25.218 --> 16:26.386
[panting]

16:28.121 --> 16:29.756
Ow, ah!

16:29.790 --> 16:31.491
Okay, I got it!

16:33.459 --> 16:34.628
’Hey, cousin, you know what?’

16:34.661 --> 16:36.229
I don’t think that’s
such a hot idea.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.198
Oh, you don’t think
it’s such a hot idea?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.332
‐No, I don’t.
‐Well.

16:39.365 --> 16:40.400
Let me ask
you something, Balki.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.401
’What’s that?’

16:41.434 --> 16:44.070
How many trunks have you
opened from the inside?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.405
‐Oh, don’t start it.
‐How many? How many...

16:45.438 --> 16:47.440
Oh, cousin, please!
Please, I can’t stand it!

16:47.473 --> 16:50.410
...have you opened
from the inside?

16:52.679 --> 16:55.148
‐None.
‐None? As in zero.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.418
As in never, ever have you
opened a trunk from the inside?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.253
‐That is correct.
‐Thank you.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.223
Cousin, just curious.
How many‐‐

17:03.256 --> 17:05.559
Four! F‐four.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.633
‐Cousin, you know what, I‐‐?
‐Balki, please.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.733
‐I know what I’m doing.
‐Cousin yet‐‐

17:13.767 --> 17:15.801
‐I know what I’m doing.
‐Let me just tell you‐‐

17:15.836 --> 17:17.069
Let me just tell you something.

17:17.103 --> 17:17.971
I was just going to say...

17:21.406 --> 17:22.776
...that, that little machine
was going to

17:22.809 --> 17:24.310
poke through
the top of the trunk.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.749
Alright!

17:28.782 --> 17:31.317
There’s gotta be something else
in here that we can use

17:31.351 --> 17:33.086
to, to pop open the lid.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.420
Just look around.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.689
’See if you can find something.’

17:35.722 --> 17:37.057
[Larry panting]

17:39.225 --> 17:41.261
‐Cousin?
‐Ah?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.263
What’s in this box?
No, don’t open the box.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.765
[air gushing]

17:47.734 --> 17:49.603
[screaming]

18:04.150 --> 18:05.819
You...

18:05.852 --> 18:08.655
You live with someone
for five years.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.728
And you think you know them.

18:16.597 --> 18:17.864
Balki.

18:17.898 --> 18:22.636
Then you spend a night
in a car trunk with them.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.606
Balki, this is not
what you think.

18:25.639 --> 18:27.273
It’s not an inflatable woman?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.412
Oh, yes, it is.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.282
Does the lady have a name?

18:38.251 --> 18:41.221
I use this so I can drive
in the carpool lane

18:41.254 --> 18:42.288
when I’m driving alone.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.364
[squealing]

18:52.766 --> 18:54.367
They stopped.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.671
Oh, yeah, we are out
in the woods alright.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.907
Balki, if they find us,
we’re dead men.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.910
‐Cousin.
‐Shh!

19:03.944 --> 19:05.178
Cousin!

19:05.211 --> 19:06.780
Aargh!

19:06.813 --> 19:08.148
I’m so sorry.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.719
Well, I hope you
enjoyed that sneeze

19:12.753 --> 19:15.255
because it just
caused us our lives!

19:15.288 --> 19:17.490
[car door opens]

19:17.524 --> 19:18.725
Oh! Oh, no.

19:18.759 --> 19:20.894
Oh, no, please.
No, please. Don’t shoot.

19:20.927 --> 19:24.364
No, no, no.
Alright, kill him but spare me.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.766
[indistinct chatter]

19:29.803 --> 19:30.804
‐Hi.
‐Hi.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.677
You almost scared us to death.

19:42.448 --> 19:45.919
W‐why were you driving
like criminals?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.788
Why were you driving
in the woods?

19:47.821 --> 19:49.790
And why weren’t you
using your turn signals?

19:51.525 --> 19:52.526
Why are you in the trunk?

19:53.627 --> 19:55.361
And who is your plastic friend?

19:58.498 --> 19:59.633
‐She’s with him.
‐She’s with him.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.207
[instrumental music]

20:12.913 --> 20:14.848
Cousin.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.817
Settle an argument.

20:16.850 --> 20:19.385
Which Ninja Turtle
is the most sensitive?

20:21.655 --> 20:22.923
Donatello.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.891
Hm. Told you.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.332
Hi.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.399
‐’Hi.’
‐’Hi.’

20:33.433 --> 20:34.901
Larry, this is for you.

20:34.935 --> 20:37.638
Oh, wow,
what’s the special occasion?

20:37.671 --> 20:39.005
Well, no special occasion.

20:39.039 --> 20:40.641
Just a little something
that says "I love you."

20:43.009 --> 20:45.311
Oh, what could be that
small and talk?

20:48.849 --> 20:50.651
A hamster,
if he’s properly trained.

21:02.062 --> 21:03.296
Oh.

21:05.699 --> 21:09.269
Well, it’s a pull out car radio.

21:10.771 --> 21:13.006
Oh, well, thank you.
That’s great.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.040
Thank you.

21:16.643 --> 21:20.413
Actually, cousin, all of your
ideas have been pull out radios.

21:27.087 --> 21:29.790
It’s just that the wrong people
were pulling them out.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.531
Well, not anymore.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.632
You know, Balki, you were right.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.867
I should’ve just joined
the neighborhood watch.

21:40.901 --> 21:42.836
Well, funny you should
mention that because

21:42.869 --> 21:45.105
I took the liberty,
I signed us all up.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.641
Well, this would be a good
night to turn in early, Larry.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.611
We won’t be bothered
by that pesky car alarm.

21:52.613 --> 21:53.980
Oh.

21:54.014 --> 21:55.448
Oh, oh.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.585
Well‐well, uh, uh,
a‐a‐another good idea.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.856
Cousin, there’s only one
thing wrong with that idea.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.390
‐What’s that?
‐Well...

22:04.424 --> 22:06.793
It’s our first night
on the neighborhood watch

22:06.827 --> 22:08.829
and we have been
assigned to patrol.

22:13.967 --> 22:16.570
And I’ve been assigned
the bullhorn.

22:20.140 --> 22:22.342
But I’ve been assigned
the batteries.
