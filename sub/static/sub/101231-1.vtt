Down, on the ground!

00:30.898 --> 00:31.964
Get on the ground!

00:39.373 --> 00:41.407
Wyatt to Viceroy,

00:43.577 --> 00:45.711
we have a runner, I
repeat, we have a runner.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.748
VICEROY ON
RADIO: Acknowledged.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.884
Pursue runner with
authority to shoot to kill.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.887
Copy.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.104
Double water rations for
anybody who speaks up.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.143
Nobody saw a fucking thing.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.403
If you run, you kill
one of your own.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.859
But here at The Program,

02:40.861 --> 02:44.796
we believe you are
one opportunity away

02:44.798 --> 02:47.065
from dignity and self-respect.

02:49.436 --> 02:50.369
Our motto is simple.

02:51.472 --> 02:55.574
Work for life, work for all.

02:57.478 --> 03:01.113
A life without debt
is within your reach.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.650
A fulfilled term at The Program

03:04.652 --> 03:07.853
guarantees you
financial freedom.

03:09.823 --> 03:13.192
Young man, why are
you here today?

03:13.194 --> 03:15.060
My student loans
were too much.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.097
I don't even know how
much I owe right now.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.568
And what about you?

03:23.571 --> 03:26.905
My daughter, she was sick.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.241
I was working multiple jobs
to pay for her treatment.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.311
I was living off credit.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.382
Stories like yours
are far too common.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.619
But that is about to change.

03:41.855 --> 03:42.754
Your application's
been reviewed,

03:42.756 --> 03:44.990
and everything checks out okay.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.558
According to our assessment,

03:46.560 --> 03:49.161
the debt you're carrying and
your overall credit rating,

03:49.163 --> 03:50.095
you're a perfect fit.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.398
Congratulations, I'll send
you a copy of our assessment.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.737
Work for life,

03:58.739 --> 04:03.175
work for all.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.373
Just one more piece of tape.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.040
Hey, how's it going?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.476
It's good, how
are you, Maggie?

06:17.478 --> 06:19.378
Good, thank you.

06:19.380 --> 06:22.547
Here, it's the best
I could do today.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.716
- You don't gotta.
- No, take it.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.487
Thank you.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.892
He's getting big.

06:35.763 --> 06:36.795
Healthy appetite.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.736
Fuck!

06:44.738 --> 06:47.973
Travis, goddammit,
you fucking scared me.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.176
What are you doing here?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.912
I didn't mean to
scare you, I'm sorry.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.415
What's that?

06:58.285 --> 06:59.117
Happy birthday.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.421
I don't even like
fucking flowers.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.689
They just wilt and die.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.673
You still have this?

07:22.876 --> 07:24.109
That old woman was crazy.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.012
She was right about us.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.650
Have you thought
about what I asked?

07:31.652 --> 07:33.485
You're a worker, Maggie,
you're not eligible.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.155
Not eligible.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.169
You've been drinking,
I can smell it on you.

07:54.107 --> 07:54.906
Don't do that.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.909
We don't have to turn
this into a fight.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.679
We, there's no we.

08:01.748 --> 08:02.881
You know what I meant.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.485
I work in the
morning and I'm tired.

08:06.487 --> 08:10.422
So thank you for the
flowers and the card,

08:10.424 --> 08:11.256
but you gotta go.

08:18.765 --> 08:19.598
You hear me?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.106
You remember
when we used to go

08:30.344 --> 08:31.142
to the old grain elevators?

08:31.144 --> 08:31.943
We'd climb up top and
overlook the lake?

08:31.945 --> 08:34.379
Okay, you need to go now.

08:39.052 --> 08:39.885
Well...

08:43.790 --> 08:44.623
Keep it, I don't want it.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.360
Happy birthday, Maggie.

09:04.478 --> 09:05.911
Call you debtors, takers.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.679
They tell you to get a job,
to enlist in The Program.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.853
To leave your community,
your mothers and your fathers

09:14.855 --> 09:16.721
and your siblings
and your friends,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.490
just when things
are at their worst.

09:19.993 --> 09:24.462
My own son enlisted in The
Program a year-and-a-half ago.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.199
I haven't heard from him since.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.002
No visits, no calls, nothing.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.774
For all intents and purposes,
those who have enlisted him

09:36.677 --> 09:38.610
have disappeared.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.347
We need answers.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.249
But more importantly, we need
to discourage the young people

09:44.251 --> 09:47.085
from buying into this
ridiculous promise.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.354
At least it's a
chance to start over.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.122
I'm sick of borrowing.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.191
Better to keep
borrowing than enlisting.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.593
Yeah, some choice.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.663
Come in.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.068
Maggie.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.338
There you go.

14:01.141 --> 14:01.906
Thank you.

14:03.176 --> 14:03.875
Maggie, take a seat.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.154
There's no easy
way of saying this,

14:16.156 --> 14:18.790
but you've been
here long enough.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.392
You understand the challenges
we face here at the clinic.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.130
As far as trainees go,
Maggie, you're among the best.

14:26.132 --> 14:29.868
And you're gonna make a great
nurse some day, I'm sure.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.036
I've almost satisfied
my training hours.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.572
I have my certification
exam next month.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.241
I've been working
towards this tirelessly.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.711
I understand your
struggle, I do.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.312
But I have a dozen trainees.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.680
I have to make some choices.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.448
Please.

14:45.051 --> 14:45.950
I've invested
everything into this.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.390
Why you?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.492
Why should I pick you
and not someone else?

14:55.495 --> 14:59.564
I feel I've proven
myself during my time here.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.734
I've gone above and
beyond, working overtime,

15:02.736 --> 15:03.935
off-the-clock, and
unpaid, just to help out.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.184
I stumbled onto your website.

15:21.087 --> 15:21.920
What?

15:24.124 --> 15:27.191
Seems like we both have
some choices to make.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.862
I fucking can't believe this.

15:30.864 --> 15:31.963
Do you want to be
a nurse, yes or no?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.208
Fuck you.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.901
What brings you here, Maggie?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.237
I want in.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.238
Come on,
we've been through this.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.105
I'm serious.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.541
It's not possible.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.876
You're nowhere near eligible.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.011
You simply aren't
carrying enough debt.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.380
I can't pay my bills,
my rent is past due.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.582
Oh, and did I mention
I lost my job?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.586
I'm desperate and
running out of options.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.388
I understand.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.058
And it's hard to fathom,

17:40.060 --> 17:41.359
but your credit is
actually too good.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.895
Fuck that.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.396
Look, even if I tried to
push your application through,

17:45.398 --> 17:47.432
it'd end up back on
my desk as denied.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.266
I'm sorry.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.237
I shouldn't be promoting
the competition,

17:53.239 --> 17:55.073
but why don't you go across
the street and get a loan,

17:55.075 --> 17:56.541
use the credit to get
back on your feet.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.708
I don't want another loan.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.743
I have enough debt.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.845
What I want is to be rid of it.

18:00.847 --> 18:01.345
I want to help, I do.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.280
Then do it.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.154
Why don't you move
back in with me?

18:15.795 --> 18:16.794
Not a chance.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.809
You aren't the right
fit for The Program.

18:31.811 --> 18:36.180
Maybe not, but they
don't pick 'em, you do.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.051
So pick me.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.858
I need your help.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.695
Fix the application,
make me eligible.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.898
I could lose my job.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.701
Please, Travis.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.140
I can't.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.144
I just can't.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.013
Fuck off.

23:27.774 --> 23:28.606
Go on.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.042
Is this?

23:32.044 --> 23:33.511
Your ticket in to The Program.

23:40.386 --> 23:43.754
Thank you, Travis, thank you.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.025
This is the best thing to
happen to me in a long time.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.493
I was starting to freak out.

23:52.365 --> 23:54.465
There you go.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.199
To a new start.

23:55.368 --> 23:55.933
Wait.

23:59.906 --> 24:00.671
Like we used to.

24:12.452 --> 24:15.219
You know what my favorite
thing about this place is?

24:15.221 --> 24:16.554
Yeah, I think I do.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.721
You gonna sing with me?

24:19.492 --> 24:21.492
That depends how
many of these we have.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.810
You know, Mags, your
term at The Program

24:39.812 --> 24:41.779
is going to be a while,

24:41.781 --> 24:44.148
a couple years at least.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.951
Is this your idea
of celebrating?

24:46.953 --> 24:50.354
No, I just want you
to know what to expect.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.389
It's either this or more debt.

24:55.428 --> 24:56.260
I'm just saying.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.330
What are you saying?

25:02.768 --> 25:08.172
No, forget it,
this is good, it is.

Once you've

29:35.608 --> 29:38.375
accept the terms and
conditions on page 56.

30:24.790 --> 30:25.856
Everything all right?

30:43.976 --> 30:46.043
Travis, is it?

30:47.012 --> 30:50.047
Yes, sir, is everything okay?

30:51.317 --> 30:52.049
Sit.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.059
How long have you
been with us, Travis?

31:02.061 --> 31:03.794
2 1/2 years.

31:04.830 --> 31:05.762
2 1/2 years.

31:07.299 --> 31:10.667
Back then, we had no more than
a couple dozen recruiters.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.469
Today, we employ over 200.

31:13.806 --> 31:15.572
That number has changed.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.908
But the expectations of
each and every recruiter

31:17.910 --> 31:18.775
remains the same.

31:20.212 --> 31:23.013
Now, you know we have to
follow specific criteria

31:23.015 --> 31:24.581
regarding applicants.

31:24.583 --> 31:25.382
Yes, sir.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.824
These recruits you
brought me today,

31:33.826 --> 31:34.892
anything I should know?

31:36.028 --> 31:38.328
I'm not sure that I follow.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.596
Do you know any of them?

31:49.241 --> 31:51.141
I can't say that I do.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.080
There are times you can't
always do things by the book.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.849
I get it.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.119
But when the dust settles,

32:02.121 --> 32:05.489
we have to take responsibility
for our actions,

32:06.892 --> 32:07.958
all of them.

32:12.298 --> 32:15.499
Mason is going to need a
ride back into the city.

32:29.148 --> 32:29.980
Travis.

32:32.318 --> 32:35.752
Why sit here and lie to me?

32:35.754 --> 32:38.188
Is it out of fear
of being caught?

32:40.159 --> 32:41.625
I already know.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.594
Sir, Maggie, she
really needs this.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.496
The Program is her only chance.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.131
I didn't want to see her become

32:48.133 --> 32:49.733
another worst-case scenario
before being given the chance

32:49.735 --> 32:50.767
for something better.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.002
That's not your call to make.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.571
It's not by the book.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.608
But she really needs this and
she's a really hard worker.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.577
You'll see, she'll
do great here.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.479
You lied, Travis.

33:03.615 --> 33:06.483
But worse still, you lied to me.

33:07.853 --> 33:08.652
We're done.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.520
What'll happen to her?

33:10.522 --> 33:11.822
Please, please!

35:48.113 --> 35:49.012
Are you kidding me?

35:49.014 --> 35:50.680
- Keys.
- Really?

35:57.422 --> 35:59.990
- The car.
- It's a company car.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.350
Wake up call!

36:36.862 --> 36:38.328
Your work here puts
you on the front lines

36:38.330 --> 36:40.096
of The Program.

36:41.567 --> 36:46.369
Your assignment, first to
clear and level the land,

36:48.407 --> 36:49.472
and second, to
pour a foundation.

36:50.809 --> 36:51.841
And through this work,

36:51.843 --> 36:53.310
you will all be
making a difference.

36:55.847 --> 37:00.317
A freshwater supply pipeline
is being laid down behind you.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.152
Now, I trust you all
understand the importance

37:02.154 --> 37:03.320
of freshwater these days.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.329
Your first day of work
begins in 15 minutes.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.893
You all right?

37:43.895 --> 37:46.263
Yeah, just need a
moment to catch my breath.

37:48.867 --> 37:49.399
Do you have any water?

37:49.401 --> 37:51.167
Mine's gone.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.437
You gotta ration
your canteen out here.

37:56.108 --> 37:56.840
Thanks.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.381
Back to work.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.882
Are you fucking kidding me.

40:58.590 --> 40:59.722
Anyone sitting here?

41:00.659 --> 41:01.524
No, go for it.

41:03.728 --> 41:06.663
I'm Maggie, by the way.

41:06.665 --> 41:07.497
Kyle.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.033
You been here long?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.402
A couple weeks.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.639
Let me guess, student debt.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.577
Yeah, student debt,
no work, the usual.

41:20.579 --> 41:21.511
Same as everyone.

41:26.751 --> 41:30.553
I was this close
to becoming a nurse.

41:32.257 --> 41:35.492
Four years of schooling
plus two years of placement.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.560
I was one month away from
doing my nursing exam.

41:38.663 --> 41:44.667
Anyway.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.202
At the current
rate of construction,

41:46.204 --> 41:49.172
your position puts you
eight weeks behind target.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.975
The board have expressed
significant concerns.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.776
I need the manpower that
was originally promised.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.879
Every operation requires
more manpower right now.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.848
Just get it done with
the resources you have.

42:58.109 --> 43:00.143
Ground positions,
everybody get down now!

43:01.046 --> 43:02.712
On your knees!

43:02.714 --> 43:03.846
On your knees,
motherfucker, down!

43:03.848 --> 43:06.049
Move it, move it, move it!

43:06.051 --> 43:10.954
Hands behind your
head, do it, do it now!

43:26.871 --> 43:29.005
Cross your feet.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.476
Get up, get up, let's go!

43:36.448 --> 43:37.213
Come on!

43:37.983 --> 43:38.815
Get up!

43:41.286 --> 43:42.051
Come on!

43:43.722 --> 43:44.988
Let's go, move!

43:47.926 --> 43:51.928
All clear, back to work!

43:51.930 --> 43:53.963
Everyone back to work!

43:53.965 --> 43:55.164
What the fuck was that?

43:55.166 --> 43:58.301
Protocol, anything
out of the ordinary.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.407
Back to work, now!

46:03.428 --> 46:04.260
Fuck.

46:07.031 --> 46:09.832
In a world, where
the truth is hidden,

46:11.102 --> 46:13.369
where lies are broadcast
from the streets

46:13.371 --> 46:15.071
onto the buildings
and every store,

46:15.073 --> 46:17.940
even on your personal devices.

46:17.942 --> 46:21.310
Distinguishing what is
real and what is fiction

46:21.312 --> 46:23.846
becomes the most difficult
but the most important.

46:25.717 --> 46:28.985
Today, one can live
an entire lifetime

46:28.987 --> 46:31.154
and never see any more
than what's on the surface.

46:43.501 --> 46:44.567
Shit, you okay?

46:47.839 --> 46:50.740
Ground position now,
everybody on your knees!

46:50.742 --> 46:51.908
- Leave her.
- No.

46:51.910 --> 46:52.842
Get down!

46:53.278 --> 46:55.678
Everybody on the ground,
get on your knees!

46:55.680 --> 46:56.813
Get down.

47:00.752 --> 47:02.351
She needs help, oh!

47:05.089 --> 47:05.788
That fucking hurts!

47:05.790 --> 47:07.223
Stay down and shut up.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.092
Get her out of here.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.599
Come on, get up.

47:18.002 --> 47:22.705
Asshole, I was
just trying to help.

47:24.108 --> 47:27.877
- Get back to work!
- Get back to work!

48:19.230 --> 48:21.297
Hey, that was totally
uncalled for today.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.033
I wanna file a complaint.

48:24.035 --> 48:25.601
That's not right what you did.

48:27.672 --> 48:29.038
Whatever you want.

48:29.040 --> 48:31.073
You can take it up with
the Viceroy tomorrow.

49:38.676 --> 49:40.309
The past four days,
you managed to make up

49:40.311 --> 49:42.578
exactly zero kilometers.

49:42.580 --> 49:45.514
I lost two more workers
and I'm down a recruiter.

49:45.516 --> 49:47.350
It's not just your ass
on the line at this point.

49:47.352 --> 49:49.185
I'm responsible.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.587
Listen to me, this threatens
to delay the water supply,

49:51.589 --> 49:54.357
and that is going to upset a
lot of very important people.

49:54.359 --> 49:56.525
Get your shit together
and get the job done.

50:00.198 --> 50:01.030
What?

50:07.305 --> 50:09.505
Why aren't you at work?

50:09.507 --> 50:13.242
Sir, the treatment from your
guards out at the work site,

50:14.979 --> 50:16.078
they're violent, careless
when people are injured.

50:17.382 --> 50:19.849
- You may not know...
- Sit down.

50:42.073 --> 50:43.806
You were saying?

50:43.808 --> 50:47.176
I'm saying, the treatment
from the guards at work site,

50:47.178 --> 50:48.811
it's careless and violent.

50:48.813 --> 50:52.348
If a worker is injured, they
need proper medical attention.

50:52.350 --> 50:54.417
These people have a right to...

50:56.521 --> 50:58.421
- What the fuck?
- You were saying?

51:00.091 --> 51:02.892
Now go on, something
about people and rights.

51:06.764 --> 51:08.230
People at the work
site have a right to be...

51:16.441 --> 51:19.075
Let me make something
perfectly clear for you.

51:20.511 --> 51:23.145
You have no rights while
you're in my possession.

51:24.282 --> 51:26.115
Do you understand?

51:28.553 --> 51:30.252
Nod if you understand
what I am telling you.

51:39.397 --> 51:40.830
Get her the hell out of here.

52:51.836 --> 52:54.303
You're not
eligible for a loan.

52:54.305 --> 52:56.272
My credit's
clean, check again.

52:57.642 --> 52:58.974
Flagged, there's
nothing I can do.

52:58.976 --> 53:01.043
What the hell
does flagged mean?

53:01.045 --> 53:03.612
It means no credit,
not here, not anywhere.

53:05.183 --> 53:06.849
What happened to
guaranteed loans?

53:45.823 --> 53:48.157
Hey, hey, hey, Travis!

53:52.663 --> 53:53.929
How do you know my name?

53:57.501 --> 53:58.801
I want into The Program.

53:59.770 --> 54:01.503
What?

54:01.505 --> 54:04.206
I'm just
fucking with you.

54:04.208 --> 54:06.208
Sorry man, I couldn't resist.

54:06.210 --> 54:08.010
How did you find me?

54:08.012 --> 54:09.345
You're a recruiter.

54:09.347 --> 54:11.714
Well, ex-recruiter.

54:11.716 --> 54:14.416
Anyway, someone
wants to see you.

54:14.418 --> 54:15.284
Come on.

54:52.590 --> 54:55.791
People like you
who are entitled,

54:55.793 --> 54:59.228
you understand least of
all the reality we live in.

54:59.230 --> 55:02.564
It's only now when you're
Discarded that the veil is lifted.

55:02.566 --> 55:05.467
I've been a Worker my whole
life, I'm not a Discarded.

55:08.005 --> 55:09.171
I help people.

55:09.173 --> 55:11.840
I give them a chance
to rid their debt.

55:11.842 --> 55:12.841
Even if you think that's true,

55:12.843 --> 55:14.076
you don't help people anymore.

55:14.078 --> 55:16.845
You're no longer a
Worker for The Program.

55:16.847 --> 55:18.514
Right.

55:18.516 --> 55:21.417
You're not a Worker,
you not a Debtor.

55:21.419 --> 55:22.584
You're something much worse.

55:24.422 --> 55:27.756
You won't survive long, not
alone, not in today's world.

55:30.795 --> 55:32.594
Why'd
you bring me here?

55:32.596 --> 55:34.563
My own son went in
The Program, Travis.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.400
I haven't seen him, I haven't
heard from him, nothing.

55:40.671 --> 55:41.503
He'll come back.

55:43.474 --> 55:44.740
I think you
know that's not true.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.378
He'll come back.

56:34.325 --> 56:37.760
I'm sorry about
your son, Marco, I really am.

56:37.762 --> 56:40.863
But I have someone in The
Program that I care about, too.

56:40.865 --> 56:43.432
You worried about her, Maggie?

56:45.703 --> 56:47.136
I just wanted to help her.

56:48.706 --> 56:51.106
You gave her a death sentence.

56:54.612 --> 56:56.678
Travis, whoever you pissed off,

56:56.680 --> 56:57.413
this is your chance
to punch back.

59:08.913 --> 59:09.745
Hey!

59:11.348 --> 59:12.447
What is this?

59:16.353 --> 59:17.686
$1,000 for meeting
with the Viceroy?

59:17.688 --> 59:19.988
Truck and guard, 800?

59:19.990 --> 59:25.193
Even the goddamn tent and
shitty food is $50 a day?

59:25.195 --> 59:27.896
This is insane, you can't
charge me for this stuff.

59:27.898 --> 59:30.699
Would you like to take it
up with the Viceroy again?

59:30.701 --> 59:32.601
This is ridiculous.

59:32.870 --> 59:34.670
You can't do this.

59:36.073 --> 59:37.272
Hey, it's been a
long day, come on.

59:39.843 --> 59:41.410
You can't do this!

59:57.194 --> 59:59.828
They added three fucking months
to my term, just like that.

1:00:03.634 --> 1:00:05.934
How the hell is anyone
supposed to get out of here?

1:00:08.205 --> 1:00:09.838
I think the point
is that we don't.

1:00:24.955 --> 1:00:26.922
This is supposed to be
a debt relief program.

1:00:26.924 --> 1:00:32.060
But these numbers, the
workers' debt is going up.

1:00:38.068 --> 1:00:39.134
Look at these expenses.

1:00:44.475 --> 1:00:45.507
I need to take a walk.

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:39.027
You all right?

1:01:39.029 --> 1:01:39.761
Yeah, I'm good.

1:01:42.966 --> 1:01:46.301
We have three
foundations to build today.

1:01:46.303 --> 1:01:49.638
Diggers, no breaks
until this one is ready.

1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:52.374
Runners, I want you to stay
a step ahead of the supplies

1:01:52.376 --> 1:01:55.143
before this pour here
is done, understood?

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:59.047
- Good, get to it.
- Let's go, let's go!

1:02:14.064 --> 1:02:15.497
Get down!

1:02:20.270 --> 1:02:21.336
Pick it up.

1:02:29.012 --> 1:02:29.845
Pick it up.

1:02:40.891 --> 1:02:41.857
Recover her.

1:02:49.066 --> 1:02:50.866
Get up, get up!

1:03:49.426 --> 1:03:50.492
Get back to work!

1:06:20.177 --> 1:06:21.743
This is an old logging road.

1:06:21.745 --> 1:06:23.311
Now, it's mostly overgrown,

1:06:23.313 --> 1:06:24.312
but the ground
underneath is firm.

1:06:27.017 --> 1:06:29.617
So that would have us
parking somewhere around here.

1:06:29.619 --> 1:06:30.986
Use whatever you can.

1:06:30.988 --> 1:06:33.154
Cover up the car and
cover up your tracks.

1:06:33.156 --> 1:06:35.857
The lodge is
about a mile away.

1:06:35.859 --> 1:06:37.192
Expect a guard outside and
maybe even a Blackshirt.

1:06:46.870 --> 1:06:47.702
Maggie, wake up.

1:06:49.373 --> 1:06:51.039
Come on.

1:06:52.609 --> 1:06:54.209
Those that don't
work don't come back.

1:06:59.182 --> 1:07:00.248
Come on.

1:07:10.394 --> 1:07:12.293
People don't know what
goes on inside these camps.

1:07:12.295 --> 1:07:15.196
But there's a
resistance in the city.

1:07:15.198 --> 1:07:17.399
And for them, we need
to make a statement.

1:07:22.139 --> 1:07:25.473
There are no rights in here,
not even the right to life.

1:07:28.712 --> 1:07:29.477
Listen,

1:07:32.883 --> 1:07:34.082
I need your help.

1:09:29.699 --> 1:09:30.331
Okay, go.

1:09:33.770 --> 1:09:34.369
Hurry up, hurry up.

1:10:22.752 --> 1:10:25.720
- Stop, on the ground!
- Get on the ground!

1:10:28.558 --> 1:10:29.891
Wyatt to Viceroy.

1:10:31.728 --> 1:10:34.095
We have a runner. I
repeat, we have a runner.

1:11:23.613 --> 1:11:27.482
Here we go, here
we go, here we go!

1:11:27.484 --> 1:11:29.150
Oh shit.

1:11:30.587 --> 1:11:31.586
Go, go, go!

1:11:38.828 --> 1:11:39.894
Backup! Backup!

1:11:45.568 --> 1:11:47.568
Move to lockdown.

1:11:47.570 --> 1:11:48.803
Recall all
nonessential personnel

1:11:48.805 --> 1:11:50.405
to headquarters for engagement.

1:12:36.519 --> 1:12:39.187
Hands at eye level,
, now!

1:12:39.189 --> 1:12:40.455
All nonessential
patrol personnel

1:12:40.457 --> 1:12:43.958
are under orders to engage
the enemy as hitmen.

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:46.494
Hands together.

1:12:46.496 --> 1:12:48.763
Don't any of you fucking move.

1:13:54.798 --> 1:13:58.599
What the fuck
are you doing at my camp?

1:14:07.877 --> 1:14:10.945
Move your
hands behind you.

1:14:12.449 --> 1:14:13.981
You're one of them.

1:14:13.983 --> 1:14:15.917
You've been selling people
into slavery all this time.

1:14:15.919 --> 1:14:17.585
Baby, I'm sorry,
I had no idea.

1:14:17.587 --> 1:14:19.821
You knew, stop the car!

1:14:19.823 --> 1:14:20.888
Maggie, please.

1:14:20.890 --> 1:14:22.790
You're one of them,
you're a killer.

1:14:22.792 --> 1:14:26.461
No, I'm not with them.

1:14:26.463 --> 1:14:27.295
I'm here for you.

1:14:28.331 --> 1:14:29.564
Please, you have
to listen to me.

1:14:29.566 --> 1:14:30.565
This is your only chance.

1:14:31.835 --> 1:14:33.801
There's a parallel
road south of this one.

1:14:33.803 --> 1:14:35.570
Take the compass,
and when you find it,

1:14:35.572 --> 1:14:37.205
follow it east, okay?

1:14:39.275 --> 1:14:40.441
There's a car
hidden in the bushes

1:14:40.443 --> 1:14:41.843
before you get to the main road.

1:14:42.745 --> 1:14:44.612
No matter what happens,

1:14:44.614 --> 1:14:45.480
you take it and you
get back to the city.

1:14:47.984 --> 1:14:49.350
Take it.

1:14:49.352 --> 1:14:52.353
There's gonna be trouble,
an attack on the pipeline.

1:14:52.355 --> 1:14:53.421
It's not safe.

1:14:56.993 --> 1:14:58.493
You understand
everything I've told you?

1:15:06.836 --> 1:15:07.602
Shit.

1:15:26.656 --> 1:15:29.023
Get out, out of the truck!

1:15:36.699 --> 1:15:37.965
Now, Maggie, go, go.

1:18:21.798 --> 1:18:23.464
Officials

1:18:23.466 --> 1:18:25.399
as a direct result of this
morning's terrorist attack

1:18:25.401 --> 1:18:27.835
on the pipeline, announced
the Water Corporation

1:18:27.837 --> 1:18:30.071
is unable to continue the
purification and bottling

1:18:30.073 --> 1:18:31.338
of frozen water.

1:18:31.340 --> 1:18:34.375
Under the circumstances,
national water will be

1:18:36.045 --> 1:18:39.080
to the government

1:18:39.082 --> 1:18:41.449
other option but to cease
operations until further notice.

1:18:51.227 --> 1:18:54.028
- Viceroy.
- Sir, the pipeline.

1:18:54.030 --> 1:18:54.862
There will be no way

1:18:54.864 --> 1:18:56.363
to recover from this totally.

1:18:56.365 --> 1:18:58.599
Cost-benefit analysis
shows conclusively

1:18:58.601 --> 1:19:00.000
that we can expect a
tenfold leap in applicants

1:19:00.002 --> 1:19:02.837
on account of this tragedy.

1:19:02.839 --> 1:19:05.439
All our program will benefit
from the increasing manpower.

1:19:07.510 --> 1:19:09.043
From that perspective,
you did well.

1:19:09.045 --> 1:19:11.846
I'll be following
up in short order.

1:19:11.848 --> 1:19:12.813
Wait, no sir, the.

1:20:08.938 --> 1:20:10.704
Marco!

1:20:22.952 --> 1:20:24.785
You all have
to tell me everything.

1:20:24.787 --> 1:20:25.853
What all goes on in the camp?

1:20:25.855 --> 1:20:27.822
It must be documented
for the people.

1:20:27.824 --> 1:20:28.722
This is Maggie.

1:20:29.826 --> 1:20:34.662
- Marco.
- Nice to meet you.
