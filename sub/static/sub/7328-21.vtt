WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:07.608
Anything else I can do?

00:07.641 --> 00:09.810
No. I just want
to get this over with.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.745
All right.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.047
( grunts )

00:16.817 --> 00:18.018
( sighs )

00:18.052 --> 00:21.155
Heaven forbid he should label
anything and make this easy.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.724
What're you gonna do
with his truck?

00:23.757 --> 00:24.758
I don't know.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.227
Sell it, I guess.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.295
How much you want for it?

00:27.328 --> 00:28.396
I don't know, okay?

00:28.429 --> 00:30.598
Listen, I just want
to find a picture of his mother

00:30.631 --> 00:31.699
so he can be buried with it.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.834
Not a problem.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.636
Any idea what year it is?

00:35.669 --> 00:36.670
No.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.771
Listen, I don't mean to be rude,

00:37.805 --> 00:39.640
but I just feel like being
alone.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.175
Wonder what he's got in here.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.079
Holy smoke!

00:49.617 --> 00:53.387
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:53.421 --> 00:56.790
and CBS

01:38.166 --> 01:39.300
We're leaving
in five minutes.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.434
Where have you been?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.636
I got the call. I'm here.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.606
Get up on the wrong side
of the bed, did we?

01:45.639 --> 01:46.574
My car got towed.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.709
Had to take the bus
to work this morning.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.278
Where was it parked?

01:50.311 --> 01:51.779
That's not important, Kate.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.782
Didn't make it home
last night, did you?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.619
Hi, this is
Anthony DiNozzo.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.354
I'm trying
to locate my car.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.655
It was towed

02:01.689 --> 02:04.792
from the 3400 block
of Dumbarton in Georgetown.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.727
You've already put me
on hold three times.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.796
You killed my cell phone
battery.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.299
Do not put me on hold again!
Do not...!

02:11.332 --> 02:15.869
Dumbarton. Near campus.
Really hope she was over 21.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.771
You'd love to know,
wouldn't you?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.941
Going somewhere this weekend?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.776
Love to know, wouldn't you?

02:22.810 --> 02:25.779
McGEE:
Truck's gassed up.
Ducky already left.

02:25.813 --> 02:26.647
You made it.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.216
Don't start, Probie.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.550
( Kate chuckles )

02:29.583 --> 02:30.651
Tony's car was towed.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.553
Poor baby had
to take the bus to work.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.322
You know what kind of people
take the bus?

02:34.355 --> 02:35.423
Yeah, I take the bus.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.524
Exactly.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.227
Hey, I heard you're going
to Norfolk.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.628
Shouldn't be a problem.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.795
We should still
be able to leave by 6:00.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.264
Leave?

02:44.365 --> 02:45.433
For where?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.402
You two

02:48.436 --> 02:50.704
are spending
the weekend together.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.340
( growls )

02:52.373 --> 02:53.674
Hold on. Let me paint a picture.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.276
You're a pig.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.710
Probie, any idea
where they're going?

02:56.744 --> 02:59.747
Sorry, cannot divulge
that information, Tony.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.714
Health spa.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.283
Gibbs!

03:02.316 --> 03:03.417
He'll spend all day trying
to figure it out.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.586
I do not need
him distracted.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.421
I appreciate that, Boss.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.622
What'd you find out
about the Petty Officer?

03:08.656 --> 03:09.757
He rented
a storage locker

03:09.790 --> 03:12.660
ten months ago
just before he was
shipped out for Iraq.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.727
Died in Falluja last week.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.528
His body's at the Theater

03:14.562 --> 03:17.365
Mortuary Evacuation
Point in Kuwait.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.332
McGee, you stay here.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.268
Contact NCIS in Iraq.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.603
Find out everything you can
about Petty Officer Dobbs.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.237
On it.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.838
DiNozzo, the same clothes

03:24.872 --> 03:25.839
you wore here yesterday?

03:25.873 --> 03:26.840
I buy a lot
of the same things.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.642
It makes mornings
less stressful.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.277
Yeah, I'm here.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.879
Now you're gone.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.388
( siren blips )

03:40.421 --> 03:43.524
TONY:
What kind of people use
your facility, Mr. Hager?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.493
Most of the renters
are Navy personnel.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.561
When they ship out,
they pay in advance.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.729
Your guy paid a year.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.264
Got two months left.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.465
( phone rings )
DiNozzo.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.466
Metro tow.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.567
Yeah?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.769
I checked our inventory.
We don't have...

03:55.803 --> 03:56.970
GIBBS:
Talk to me, Duck.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.872
It's definitely
female, Jethro.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.709
The male pelvis is shaped
like a butterfly.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.710
The female's is wider

04:02.743 --> 04:05.713
and has larger superior
and inferior apertures

04:05.746 --> 04:07.648
to facilitate childbirth.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.816
Age?

04:08.849 --> 04:10.918
Oh, I'd estimate
17 to 20.

04:10.951 --> 04:14.455
The pubic symphysis is an
excellent yardstick of age.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.923
Doctor....

04:15.956 --> 04:17.691
It's corrugated
in a woman's teens,

04:17.725 --> 04:19.960
and then smooths out
during her 20s and 30s.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.796
At the time
of this young lady's demise...

04:22.830 --> 04:23.597
Well, you can see

04:23.631 --> 04:25.766
it was in
the transitional stage.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.801
What is so urgent,
Mr. Palmer?

04:27.835 --> 04:29.937
It's just that, he...he....

04:29.970 --> 04:30.938
He, who?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.440
Special Agent Gibbs.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.507
What about him?

04:33.541 --> 04:34.942
He left, Doctor.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.810
Yes, I know he left.
He left some time ago.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.612
Have you only
just realized that?

04:38.646 --> 04:39.813
No.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.649
Then why mention him now?

04:41.682 --> 04:42.883
Well, it's just that I...

04:42.916 --> 04:44.352
you, you...

04:47.888 --> 04:50.358
Tell me about it.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.525
Is it that obvious?
I'm sorry, Boss.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.027
It's just upsetting.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.963
My car wasn't towed.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.699
It was stolen.

04:58.732 --> 05:02.736
Tell me about the storage
locker, DiNozzo.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.905
Right.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.073
Uh, every renter
has a code

05:06.106 --> 05:07.508
to enter the main gate.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.510
Locker number plus
the last four digits

05:09.543 --> 05:10.978
of their Social
Security number.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.780
Manager's checking
the computer

05:12.813 --> 05:15.649
to see if anyone accessed
Petty Officer Dobbs's locker.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.919
Sorry.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.521
Mm-hmm.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.024
Justin and I

05:24.057 --> 05:26.427
were friends
since freshman year
in high school.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.428
Boyfriend?

05:27.461 --> 05:28.496
No, just friends.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.763
But you have the key
to his locker.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.131
Yeah, he mailed
it to me

05:31.164 --> 05:33.667
with a will and
power-of-attorney.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.569
That's a lot to saddle
a friend with.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.704
Yeah, tell me
about it.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.871
Something I could
do without.

05:37.905 --> 05:38.939
Why you?

05:38.972 --> 05:40.808
He didn't have
anybody else.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.875
DUCKY:
Give me the bag,
Mr. Palmer.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.412
Tag this for me.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.047
It's stressful,
I'm sure.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.682
Do you have any idea
who's in that truck?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.386
No.

05:53.921 --> 05:54.988
We're going to find out, Emmy.

05:55.022 --> 05:55.789
It'd be real good

05:55.823 --> 05:57.925
if you told us
anything you know.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.632
There was a girl--

06:04.665 --> 06:05.433
Nora Webb.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.568
We were all friends
in high school.

06:07.601 --> 06:11.138
She disappeared our senior year.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.008
The police always suspected

06:15.042 --> 06:17.811
that Justin knew
what happened to her.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.146
DUCKY:
All right, let's wrap her up,
Mr. Palmer.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.185
Contact NCIS Iraq?

06:25.218 --> 06:28.021
McGEE:
They were well aware
of Petty Officer Dobbs.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.657
He got in trouble.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.791
Just the opposite, Boss.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.893
His C.O. wrote him up
for a posthumous Silver Star.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.028
Actually, the CO wants
to talk to you.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.064
He's standing by to go on
satellite right now.

06:37.097 --> 06:41.101
Kate, talk to the LEOs
in Dobbs's hometown.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.169
Verify what the girl told us.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.538
Do not tell them what we found.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.539
Got it.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.907
DiNozzo, talk to the insurance

06:46.940 --> 06:48.909
agent on your own time.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.444
Get down
to the garage.

06:50.478 --> 06:54.548
Start an inventory
on Petty Officer Dobbs's stuff.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.553
Gibbs is a boat man.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.489
He doesn't understand
I have to have my car.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.523
They're giving you a rental,
DiNozzo.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.524
What's the big deal?

07:03.557 --> 07:04.958
Not the same, bus boy.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.660
My car is part of my being.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.995
It's a car, Tony.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.097
It's a classic, Kate.

07:10.130 --> 07:15.135
It's a '90 Z.R.1 Corvette;
powerful, fast.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.470
It's gorgeous.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.539
In other words, it's you.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.609
Exactly.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.912
Under heavy fire,

07:24.945 --> 07:27.848
Petty Officer Dobbs
single-handedly dragged

07:27.881 --> 07:29.216
two Marines to safety.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.486
He saved their lives
at the cost of his own.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.154
That's why I recommended him

07:34.187 --> 07:36.056
and forwarded it
up the chain of command.

07:36.089 --> 07:36.890
Now, I understand

07:36.924 --> 07:39.259
you're a former Marine,
Agent Gibbs.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.227
I am.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.930
Then you know
we don't take this lightly.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.600
This was
an extraordinary young man.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.236
Now this is Lance Corporal
Jaime Ramos.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.539
He served
with Petty Officer Dobbs.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.141
Sir, Petty Officer Dobbs
wasn't a Marine,

07:54.174 --> 07:55.909
but he was one of us.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.946
He served in our platoon,
the whole tour as our corpsman.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.214
What they're saying about Doc
can't be true, sir.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.050
He died saving lives over here.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.720
Whatever you can do, we'd
appreciate it, Agent Gibbs.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.089
Understood, Lieutenant.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.124
The thing is, sir,

08:11.158 --> 08:15.095
Doc isn't around
to defend himself now.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.764
You have to, sir.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.136
Ducky, is it her?

08:23.170 --> 08:26.907
She is, indeed,
Nora Webb, Jethro.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.910
I had a positive I.D.
using dental records

08:29.943 --> 08:32.279
from the FBI's Missing
Person's Database.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.246
How long's she been dead?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.815
How long
she been missing?
Almost two years.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.183
Petty Officer Dobbs rented

08:36.216 --> 08:37.618
the locker ten months ago.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.219
Well, I'd venture
that she met her fate

08:39.252 --> 08:41.822
around the time
of her disappearance.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.190
Of course, I can't be certain
till I know

08:43.223 --> 08:46.059
where the young lady's
remains were kept.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.195
The deterioration would be
affected by whether

08:48.228 --> 08:49.863
she was indoors,
void of the elements,

08:49.897 --> 08:52.232
or buried outside
in the....

08:52.265 --> 08:53.166
...ground.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.267
Cause of death.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.672
Uh, that would be hard
to determine.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.607
Duck, I need to know.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.015
Sign this for
me over here.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.216
Go ahead, pull it.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.919
Oh, wow.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.954
It only looks like a skull
and crossbones.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.057
Home movies:

09:17.090 --> 09:18.058
Little League '97,

09:18.091 --> 09:20.060
Christmas '95.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.194
Hoo-yeah!

09:21.228 --> 09:22.329
And the winner is?

09:22.362 --> 09:25.132
High School, senior year.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.166
Danke schoen.

09:26.199 --> 09:31.171
So what exactly
do you girls do
at a health spa?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.340
Get pampered.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.875
Massages?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.977
Many kinds.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.211
Full body?

09:38.245 --> 09:41.081
Places you could
only dream of, DiNozzo.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.983
Masseuse or masseur?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.184
I go both ways. You?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.218
( phone rings )

09:45.252 --> 09:48.121
Only with, uh...

09:48.155 --> 09:49.189
Harris, my insurance agent.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.358
Whatever works, man.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.628
Spoke with a LEO
in Richfield, Virginia.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.363
Officer Billy Krieg confirms
that Justin Dobbs

09:56.396 --> 09:57.197
was a Person of Interest

09:57.230 --> 09:58.265
in the disappearance
of Nora Webb.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.266
What else?

09:59.299 --> 10:00.267
Not much.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.202
Dobbs enlisted
out of high school.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.271
He was raised
by a single mother
who died of cancer

10:04.304 --> 10:05.305
while he was in boot camp.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.274
Got in the Advanced Medical
Training Program.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.676
Made PO3.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.177
Boss, Lieutenant
Commander Coleman

10:10.210 --> 10:11.745
wants to talk to you.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.280
Tell her I'm not here.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.948
Why don't you tell me yourself?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.249
Commander Coleman.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.317
Special Agent Gibbs.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.257
Tony.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.159
Kate.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.296
McGee.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.869
SECNAV wants JAG involved
in the investigation

10:35.903 --> 10:37.270
of Petty Officer Dobbs.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.138
Why?

10:38.171 --> 10:39.973
He's on the fast track
for a Silver Star.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.441
The Navy doesn't want
to be embarrassed

10:41.474 --> 10:43.210
by awarding it to a murderer.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.778
Did he do it?

10:44.812 --> 10:47.180
I'll let you know when the
investigation concludes.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.916
Petty Officer Dobbs's remains
are arriving

10:48.949 --> 10:51.852
at the military mortuary
in Dover on Sunday.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.321
His unit is pushing
for a funeral with full honors.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.255
You've got 24 hours.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.890
That's not enough time.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.959
SECNAV can't wait.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.329
You've got 24 hours.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.811
Cancel all weekend plans.

11:26.053 --> 11:30.123
DiNOZZO:
That guy
is Justin Dobbs.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.125
The girl in pink
is Emmy Poole

11:32.159 --> 11:34.161
with our victim,
Nora Webb.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.963
If the time stamp's
accurate on this tape,

11:35.996 --> 11:37.497
this would've been
shot two days before

11:37.530 --> 11:39.066
she was reported missing.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.101
Well, from this video,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.103
doesn't look
like anything's wrong.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.006
Sure brings back
memories, Probie.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.775
( chuckles )

11:47.808 --> 11:49.910
( sighs )

11:49.943 --> 11:50.844
I don't suppose you had

11:50.878 --> 11:53.781
a car to wash
in high school.

11:53.814 --> 11:54.782
Actually I did, Tony.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.016
My parents bought
one for me

11:56.049 --> 11:57.851
the day I turned 16.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.320
Let me guess-- Yugo?

12:00.353 --> 12:02.790
No, it was much
cooler than that.

12:02.823 --> 12:03.791
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.092
What was I thinking?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.026
I forgot who

12:06.059 --> 12:07.427
I'm dealing with here.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.362
Ah... Duster?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.297
Nope.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.264
Gremlin.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.200
Not gonna guess it, Tony.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.435
One of the Ford trilogy
of dork mobiles?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.103
Maverick?

12:17.070 --> 12:17.504
Fiesta?

12:19.172 --> 12:19.907
Pinto?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.543
If you say Datsun Honeybee,

12:23.576 --> 12:24.211
I'm gonna come

12:24.244 --> 12:25.979
over there
and smack you.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.816
'84 Camaro Z-28

12:28.849 --> 12:30.784
five-speed.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.256
That's a smoking-hot
car, McGee.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.326
What the hell
went wrong with you?

12:39.359 --> 12:41.061
( sighs )

12:41.094 --> 12:43.163
Well, the first day
I got behind the wheel,

12:43.196 --> 12:46.533
I had a slight thing.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.068
Head-on?

12:48.101 --> 12:51.004
I was trying
to figure out the wipers...

12:51.038 --> 12:55.242
took my eyes off
the road for a second.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.211
When I looked up, there it was,
right in front of me.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.546
Car.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.281
Bus.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.488
I got a student pass
the day

13:08.521 --> 13:09.923
I got out of traction.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.900
I didn't know.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.171
MAN:
Sure it's Nora Webb?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.205
We're sure.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.107
Knew the son of a bitch did it.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.109
Justin Dobbs
was the prime suspect?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.543
Nora Webb was last seen
leaving a party with him.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.214
Kids saw her
drive off in the truck.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.548
Next day
the parents

13:35.582 --> 13:36.616
reported her missing.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.918
When we brought him in,

13:37.951 --> 13:39.452
he had scratches
on his face and arms.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.388
I'm sure he had
an explanation, of course.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.522
Don't they always?

13:42.555 --> 13:45.292
Said she got... abusive
before he dropped her home.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.028
People at the party
thought they saw him

13:48.061 --> 13:49.029
coming onto her.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.432
They ever have anything
between them before?

13:52.465 --> 13:55.235
No, but he had been drinking.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.203
So, you think
he pressed it

13:56.236 --> 13:58.471
with her in the car,
when she didn't go along,

13:58.505 --> 13:59.472
things got
out of hand.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.507
Figured he'd buried her

14:00.540 --> 14:02.175
in the woods. When we
couldn't find the body,

14:02.209 --> 14:04.211
the D.A.
chose not to go forward.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.278
After graduation,

14:05.312 --> 14:08.148
Justin Dobbs slinked out
of town in a Navy uniform.

14:08.181 --> 14:13.286
Petty Officer Dobbs died in that
uniform saving lives, Chief.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.222
Appreciate that,
Agent Gibbs.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.125
Doesn't excuse taking one
before he left.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.262
I'd like a copy
of that case file.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.597
Not a problem.
Pull it, Billy.

14:24.631 --> 14:28.268
Then show our friends
where the copy machine is.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.913
Chief Whalen
doesn't have a doubt

14:39.947 --> 14:41.548
about Petty Officer
Dobbs's guilt.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.017
Nope.
So what do you think?

14:44.051 --> 14:46.920
I was him,
I wouldn't either.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.289
Mr. and Mrs. Webb?

14:50.157 --> 14:51.124
Special Agents Gibbs

14:51.158 --> 14:53.093
and Todd, NCIS.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.427
We know.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.628
WHALEN:
Mr. and Mrs. Webb,

14:55.662 --> 14:56.997
y'all take care.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.398
Been pushing

14:58.431 --> 14:59.699
for a faster copier.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.002
Hope it didn't cause
too much inconvenience.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.110
When do we get
our daughter back?

15:10.143 --> 15:11.644
Our investigation
is almost over.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.013
Chief Whalen concluded

15:13.046 --> 15:15.048
the investigation
a long time ago.

15:15.082 --> 15:15.983
If Justin murdered
your daughter,

15:16.016 --> 15:18.218
our investigation
will only confirm it.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.288
We don't need
a confirmation.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.556
( crying )

15:28.295 --> 15:31.164
Do you know how...

15:31.198 --> 15:33.400
how she died?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.135
Not yet.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.273
Is that all?

15:40.307 --> 15:42.109
We just have
a few questions.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.311
No, we're not going to do it.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.478
I know this is difficult.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.047
You don't know anything, lady.

15:47.080 --> 15:47.680
Mr. Webb....

15:47.714 --> 15:48.548
Kate.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.052
Appreciate your time.
Thank you.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.296
( electronic music playing )

16:09.536 --> 16:11.238
What's up, Palmer?

16:11.271 --> 16:12.305
Oh, I, uh, brought you

16:12.339 --> 16:14.541
a substance for analysis.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.209
Where'd you get it?

16:16.243 --> 16:18.278
The victim's femur bone.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.280
Just put it over there.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.083
Hey, sorry to hear
about your weekend.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.351
Oh, hmm...

16:24.384 --> 16:25.318
Tony?

16:25.352 --> 16:26.519
Yeah, mass e-mail.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.355
The sender was "Anonymous,"

16:28.388 --> 16:30.190
but it was
pretty obvious.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.260
Lots of lascivious references.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.465
You know,
the inefficient flow of chi

16:38.498 --> 16:40.667
is a major source of stiffness.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.270
Uh, silent auction item

16:43.303 --> 16:45.238
at my niece's
school benefit:

16:45.272 --> 16:47.607
a weekend seminar in
the art of shiatsu.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.775
Do me.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.810
Uh, n... I-I showed up late.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.312
Your hands,

16:52.345 --> 16:54.414
my body-- now.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.786
( cracking )
Ah...

16:59.819 --> 17:01.221
Ah... What the hell

17:01.254 --> 17:02.655
are you doing,
Palmer?
I-I-I...

17:02.689 --> 17:04.224
You read the Agency policy

17:04.257 --> 17:06.393
on sexual harassment,
didn't you, Palmer?

17:06.426 --> 17:07.260
It wasn't like that!

17:07.294 --> 17:10.163
It never is.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.365
Now, go, you
little autopsy gremlin.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.533
Get out of here.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.070
What do you got, Abbs?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.771
He's doing it again, McGee.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.440
Mm-hmm.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.841
Doing what?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.144
You become Gibbs
when he's not around.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.278
I do not.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.779
Actually, you do.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.317
The Caff-Pow, the head-slaps,

17:30.350 --> 17:32.319
turning my music off.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.321
( deep voice ):
"What do you got, Abbs?"

17:34.354 --> 17:36.289
McGEE:
He has been
in a foul mood all day.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.624
That's another Gibbs trait.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.665
You don't quite have
the stare down yet.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.335
( chuckles )

17:48.368 --> 17:49.602
Hey, what are you

17:49.636 --> 17:50.737
giggling about?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.405
Inventory the contents
now, Probie!

17:52.439 --> 17:56.243
( sighs ):
Dobbs's sea bag,

17:56.276 --> 17:58.445
sent from Iraq--
has all his personal effects.

17:58.478 --> 18:02.215
Do you know anything
about chi, McGee?

18:09.222 --> 18:11.458
It was Nora.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.492
It was.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.327
How long
have you known

18:14.361 --> 18:16.429
about Justin's storage locker,
Emmy?

18:16.463 --> 18:19.532
A week-- when
I read the will.

18:21.168 --> 18:21.568
Oh.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.472
Thanks.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.406
You didn't read it
until he died?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.175
Anything wrong with that?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.742
Who else knew
about the will?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.512
No idea.
He wrote it up online.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.647
I didn't recognize
the names of the witnesses.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.149
Guys from his unit, I guess.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.484
We'll need a copy.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.851
Okay.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.787
So you and Petty
Officer Dobbs....

18:40.820 --> 18:42.021
We were tight in high school.

18:42.054 --> 18:45.425
Listen, it was his idea to go
off to the stupid war, okay?

18:45.458 --> 18:46.559
I didn't need this.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.761
And you and Nora Webb?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.464
Friends.
It was high school, okay?

18:52.699 --> 18:55.268
Customer's waiting.
Are we through?

18:55.302 --> 18:56.669
For now.

18:58.638 --> 19:03.410
Lot of pissed-off people
here in Richfield.
( laughs )

19:03.443 --> 19:06.613
DUCKY:
Here's something interesting,
Mr. Palmer-- the hyoid bone.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.415
Do you know
what makes it unique?

19:08.448 --> 19:09.516
No, Doctor.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.319
* Dem bones, dem bones,
dem dry bones *

19:12.352 --> 19:13.386
* The shoulder bone
connected to the *

19:13.420 --> 19:15.522
* Neck bone, the neck bone
connected to the *

19:15.555 --> 19:17.457
* Head bone...

19:17.490 --> 19:20.159
The hyoid bone, Mr. Palmer--
to what is it connected?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.596
Nothing.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.565
Correct.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.467
Of the 206 bones
in the human body,

19:27.500 --> 19:28.568
the hyoid is the only one

19:28.601 --> 19:30.637
not articulated to any other.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.605
Cool.
Its name derives

19:32.639 --> 19:35.608
from the Greek, uh, U-O-I-D--

19:35.642 --> 19:37.410
shaped like a "U."

19:37.444 --> 19:39.412
Upsilon.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.548
I hope you learned that
in medical school

19:41.581 --> 19:43.483
and not at some
fraternity ritual.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.784
You see,

19:44.817 --> 19:46.619
this one is distorted.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.421
Looks like it's been crushed.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.590
And that would suggest...?

19:50.623 --> 19:52.259
Strangulation.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.427
Yes!

19:54.461 --> 19:55.828
Who's the cop?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.598
No idea.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.999
What do you have, McGee?

20:00.032 --> 20:02.269
Well, the, uh, records show
that no one accessed

20:02.302 --> 20:04.504
the store facility
with Petty Officer Dobbs's code

20:04.537 --> 20:05.738
after he deployed.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.374
Personal effects?

20:07.407 --> 20:08.641
Nothing out of the ordinary.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.310
Only thing of interest was

20:10.343 --> 20:12.479
a padlock key identical
to the one Emmy Poole had.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.647
( phone rings )
Yeah. Gibbs.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.516
MAN ( over phone ):
Video conference call.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.421
DiNozzo...
Boss,

20:21.454 --> 20:24.524
you're never gonna
believe this.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.461
My car was used in
a convenience store
robbery in Tennessee.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.332
But I'm... I'm cool.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.633
So not important

20:33.666 --> 20:36.235
in the grand scheme
of things.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.511
You've had 24 hours.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.878
Not enough time.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.781
Petty Officer Dobbs's body
left Kuwait an hour ago.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.283
What do I tell the SECNAV?

20:50.317 --> 20:54.387
Nothing conclusive
at this point.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.489
You are forcing me
to have the medal withheld.

20:56.523 --> 20:59.459
You might be denying a hero
his due.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.393
Give me something, Gibbs.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.862
Is there anything
working in his favor?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.033
You're breaking up, Faith.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.701
I can see you just fine.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.304
Must be a solar flare.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.405
Gibbs...

21:17.710 --> 21:19.946
Such a mysterious room.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.782
You got something, Duck?

21:22.815 --> 21:25.718
Yeah. Cause of death:
strangulation.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.955
Things not going
too well?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.523
Running out of time.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.659
You ever think that
the petty officer

21:32.692 --> 21:33.960
might be guilty?

21:33.993 --> 21:35.328
Crossed my mind.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.464
Yeah, more than
once, obviously.

21:37.497 --> 21:41.834
Otherwise you'd be
telling me your gut
says he's not guilty.

21:41.868 --> 21:45.638
Some Marine guts in Iraq
are saying that.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.741
But not yours?

21:51.611 --> 21:52.845
Hm?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.681
Yeah.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.983
Yeah, my gut says it, too.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.718
Your gut

21:58.751 --> 22:00.587
or Semper Fi?

22:01.721 --> 22:03.623
Emmy Poole is holding back.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.491
I want her

22:04.524 --> 22:07.860
in Interrogation now.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.897
( ringing )

22:13.600 --> 22:14.734
MAN:
Yes?

22:14.767 --> 22:17.069
This is NCIS Special Agent Todd.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.572
I'd like to speak
with Emmy Poole.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.340
Not gonna happen, Agent Todd.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.559
( siren blares )

22:39.592 --> 22:41.728
Nice truck.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.073
If we hadn't called
the house, would you
have notified us?

22:54.106 --> 22:55.708
Eventually.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.977
GIBBS:
I'd sure like
my people to
have a look.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.846
It was a suicide.
What do you expect to find?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.749
Emmy Poole was material
to my investigation.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.817
Investigation into a murder that
took place two years ago here

23:04.851 --> 23:06.819
when Justin Dobbs
was a civilian.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.488
That was a local matter.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.589
Just like this is.

23:09.622 --> 23:10.857
Understood.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.562
You want to take
a look around, fine.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.765
We just removed the body;
crime scene's intact.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.775
( shutter clicking )

23:28.808 --> 23:29.942
Who found her?

23:29.976 --> 23:31.844
The mother.
Like to speak with her.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.112
You're welcome
to read her statement.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.080
She's with friends.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.848
Didn't want to stay
at the house tonight.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.452
Leave a note?
Not that we found.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.087
Mother said she'd
been depressed,

23:41.120 --> 23:43.723
on medication for the
past couple of years.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.024
( shutter clicking )

23:45.057 --> 23:47.494
Since the disappearance
of Nora Webb?

23:47.527 --> 23:49.796
Where are you going
with this, Gibbs?

23:49.829 --> 23:51.864
According to the mother,
Emmy was close to Nora.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.232
Took her disappearance hard.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.535
Don't think finding
the body helped.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.037
Yeah, we... we spoke
to Emmy this afternoon.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.573
Thing is,
kept getting the feeling

24:00.607 --> 24:02.975
she wasn't telling us
everything she knew.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.711
All there is to know is...

24:04.744 --> 24:06.746
Justin Dobbs
killed Nora Webb.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.181
So you keep saying.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.653
( shutter clicks )

24:13.686 --> 24:15.922
( people talking in distance )

24:26.232 --> 24:28.701
( panting )

24:34.541 --> 24:36.943
( exhales )

24:36.976 --> 24:39.512
This your idea of an apology?

24:39.546 --> 24:41.714
For what?

24:41.748 --> 24:43.583
I just don't like
to drink alone.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.985
The fact that you know
where to find me

24:46.018 --> 24:48.821
on a Sunday morning
is a little scary, Gibbs.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.923
( car alarm chirps )
Please.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.929
Not as scary

24:56.963 --> 24:58.164
as your trunk.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.232
What do you want?

25:00.266 --> 25:02.101
Talk to the office
of the SECNAV yet?

25:02.134 --> 25:03.235
No.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.004
The girl who found the remains

25:05.037 --> 25:07.006
in Petty Officer Dobbs's truck
is dead.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.275
Suicide, maybe.

25:09.308 --> 25:12.011
You think she was involved?

25:12.044 --> 25:13.112
I don't know.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.014
She could've had an accomplice.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.783
I need more time.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.117
Petty Officer
Dobbs's funeral

25:18.150 --> 25:20.019
is tomorrow.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.154
Not if I order his remains
quarantined

25:22.188 --> 25:23.823
at Dover morgue.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.024
What are you up to?

25:25.057 --> 25:26.593
I need our M.E.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.261
to examine the body
as part of our investigation.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.731
Dobbs died as a result
of enemy fire in Iraq.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.633
What bearing does
that have on a girl

25:33.666 --> 25:36.068
who was killed two years ago
in Richfield, Virginia?

25:37.737 --> 25:40.339
You can never be too thorough.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.909
You're pushing it, Gibbs.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.311
Why are you sticking
your neck out for this guy?

25:45.344 --> 25:47.680
Several Marines witnessed

25:47.714 --> 25:50.983
Petty Officer Dobbs
saving lives.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.185
No one witnessed him taking one.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.563
Mrs. Webb.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.566
Special Agent DiNozzo.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.237
We don't know if you've
heard about Emmy Poole.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.005
( quietly ):
Yeah.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.675
Her poor mother.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.176
Well, we're sorry
to bother you.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.010
Just a few questions.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.212
Your daughter and
Emmy were close.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.814
They were very close.

26:21.848 --> 26:24.150
Emmy practically lived
at our house.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.018
She was always sleeping over.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.119
They ever have
a falling out?

26:27.153 --> 26:29.321
Oh, God, no.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.556
I felt sorry for Emmy.

26:30.589 --> 26:34.160
She was caught in the middle
between her two best friends.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.628
Nora and Justin.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.896
Nora had disappeared,

26:36.929 --> 26:39.732
and everyone believed
Justin was responsible.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.400
She couldn't handle it.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.136
And then finding Nora.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.173
It must've sent her
over the edge.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.909
The past two years
have been hell for us.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.913
That's why we've sold
the business and...

26:53.946 --> 26:57.850
It was just too many
bad memories in this town.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.085
BRUCE:
Hey.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.953
What are you
doing here?

27:00.987 --> 27:03.089
Chief Whalen said
we don't have to deal with you.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.157
They're just trying
to do their job.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.160
They want Justin Dobbs
buried as a war hero,
that's what they want.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.029
He killed our daughter.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.263
As far as I'm concerned,

27:11.297 --> 27:13.632
he's responsible
for Emmy's death as well.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.703
Leave now.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.247
( long sigh )

27:28.280 --> 27:30.249
Why don't you get
one of these?

27:30.282 --> 27:32.218
Fits your personality
perfectly-- loud,

27:32.251 --> 27:33.986
overbearing,
politically incorrect.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.121
It is tempting, Kate,

27:35.154 --> 27:37.824
but I love the car I have.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.259
Had. Too bad
you're not as faithful

27:40.292 --> 27:41.861
to the women in your life.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.730
Ha! That's funny.

27:43.763 --> 27:47.133
But for your sake, I do hope
that you and she reunite.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.901
Actually, I don't know
if I want it back.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.236
And why is that?

27:50.269 --> 27:52.104
She's been violated.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.173
( siren chirps )

27:54.206 --> 27:56.242
( indistinct police radio
transmission )

27:59.478 --> 28:00.913
( clears throat )

28:02.248 --> 28:06.152
Here to escort us
to the city limits, Officer?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.487
The chief wants you to
leave the Webbs alone.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.757
They've been through a lot.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.259
Well, we realize that,
Officer.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.994
We're just trying to resolve

28:15.027 --> 28:16.996
Petty Officer Dobbs's
guilt or innocence.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.331
Now, why can't you just
accept the facts?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.167
They're right there
in front of you.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.236
Actually, the only thing
in front of us right now...

28:24.270 --> 28:25.471
is you.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.208
You move, we'll leave.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.476
Maybe.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.819
Well, I think
it's the power supply.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.287
You "think"?

28:41.320 --> 28:43.923
Well, it'd be helpful
if I had a service manual.

28:49.028 --> 28:52.331
I was at church, Gibbs.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.532
What do you got, Abbs?

28:53.565 --> 28:55.301
First of all,
you owe me big-time.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.502
It took Kate and
me six months

28:56.535 --> 28:58.337
to get the reservations
to that spa.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.806
You tell me
you found something,

28:59.839 --> 29:01.307
I'll think about
making it up to you.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.975
( gasps ):
Typical man.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.310
Promise you everything
until he gets

29:04.343 --> 29:06.445
what he wants--
right, McGee?

29:06.478 --> 29:09.348
Well, actually, I...
Thanks, McGee.
So, I found dirt

29:09.381 --> 29:11.450
on her femur bone,
and identical traces

29:11.483 --> 29:14.186
on the inside of
the plastic she
was wrapped in.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.255
But not on the outside.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.257
Nora Webb was buried
in the ground, then removed.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.459
And then wrapped in plastic,
and then put in that truck.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.195
Chief Whalen always thought
she was buried in the woods.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.463
Maybe yes, maybe no.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.365
Do you have anything
more specific than dirt?

29:26.398 --> 29:28.367
Well, I was trying, except
my mass spectrometer crashed.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.235
And there's a certain

29:29.268 --> 29:31.270
MIT grad that's supposed
to be fixing it

29:31.303 --> 29:33.072
but is actually
making it worse.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.407
Sooner than later, McGee.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.378
Oh...

29:39.411 --> 29:41.380
Why don't you just hire
a service tech!

29:41.413 --> 29:43.282
Well, I would, McGee.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.384
But it's Sunday!

29:49.121 --> 29:50.322
Oh, there you are.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.323
Appreciate you coming.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.558
It's a godsend, actually.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.828
Mother has the ladies
of the kennel club
over for cocktails.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.397
Take a ride, Ducky.
Oh...

29:58.430 --> 30:02.168
Oh, I had a conversation
with the M.E. at Richfield.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.237
He came to the same conclusion--
suicide, indeed.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.138
The, uh...

30:06.172 --> 30:08.274
lacerations
on the young girl's wrists

30:08.307 --> 30:09.341
gave every indications

30:09.375 --> 30:11.343
of being self-inflicted.

30:11.377 --> 30:14.180
But that's not why
you asked me in here.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.115
They're holding Petty
Officer Dobbs's body for you

30:16.148 --> 30:17.116
at the Dover morgue.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.117
I don't get it.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.551
I thought he died
in combat.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.088
I need you to take a look,
Ducky.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.255
What do you expect me to find?

30:23.289 --> 30:24.423
Nothing.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.558
I just need to buy more time.

30:26.592 --> 30:30.997
Oh, Jethro... I can spend
forever finding nothing.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.633
Great. Thank you.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.002
Boss, tracked down
the two witnesses

30:36.035 --> 30:37.436
who signed Petty Officer
Dobbs's will, Boss.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.470
Both were Corpsmen

30:38.504 --> 30:40.472
he met in training.
One's stationed at GITMO,

30:40.506 --> 30:41.473
the other Coronado.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.275
Neither knew anything relevant.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.243
ABBY:
Gibbs, Gibbs.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.012
Gibbs-- are we still on?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.513
Weekend at the spa

30:47.546 --> 30:49.448
if I've come up with
something really big?

30:49.481 --> 30:51.417
This is a piece

30:51.450 --> 30:53.519
of the plastic sheet
that the victim's body
was wrapped in.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.586
You lift a print?

30:54.620 --> 30:55.521
Negatory.

30:55.554 --> 30:56.388
Trace evidence?
No, but...

30:56.422 --> 30:58.090
this a really big but.

30:58.124 --> 31:01.393
From analysis of the
polymers and the resins,

31:01.427 --> 31:02.394
I tracked down the manufacturer.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.430
They've reworked
their formula.

31:04.463 --> 31:05.664
It's polyethylene,

31:05.697 --> 31:06.665
four-mils thick.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.400
It's more flexible
and resistant to tearing.

31:08.434 --> 31:09.201
What's the point, Abby?

31:09.235 --> 31:10.569
This is a brand-new
product, Gibbs.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.404
It's only been on the market
for four months.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.107
Petty Officer Dobbs
has been in Iraq
for ten months.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.408
He couldn't have
put it there.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.545
So can I make those reservations
now?

31:20.446 --> 31:22.414
What's the matter, Gibbs?

31:22.448 --> 31:24.650
That does not mean that
Petty Officer Dobbs is innocent.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.618
It only means
he could've had an accomplice.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.387
Emmy Poole?

31:28.420 --> 31:29.922
Yeah, Gibbs.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.424
I'll be right there.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.395
You're not calling
with good news.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.330
COLEMAN:
I'm sorry, Gibbs.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.267
SECNAV made his decision.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.169
He won't sign off
on the Star.

31:51.143 --> 31:54.013
You think he's gonna
want us to hang around?

31:54.046 --> 31:55.014
I don't know.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.348
I can't imagine

31:56.382 --> 31:59.451
there's anything that
can't wait till tomorrow.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.187
Go ask him.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.022
You ask.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.457
( scoffs ):
You're the
"special agent."

32:05.491 --> 32:07.193
Yeah, well, he likes you more.

32:07.226 --> 32:11.030
That's because I don't ask him
stupid questions.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.665
Rock, paper, scissors?

32:13.699 --> 32:14.967
On three.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.605
Something on your mind?

32:19.638 --> 32:20.739
No.
No.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.108
You weren't thinking

32:22.141 --> 32:23.109
about leaving, were you?

32:23.142 --> 32:25.277
Oh, uh, no.
Absolutely not, no.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.047
I was just gonna go, um,

32:28.080 --> 32:29.681
check on the old spectrometer.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.120
Assuming Petty
Officer Dobbs

32:34.153 --> 32:35.721
was innocent,
why did Nora Webb's remains

32:35.754 --> 32:37.956
show up in his storage locker?

32:38.790 --> 32:41.060
Someone was framing him?

32:41.093 --> 32:44.096
Emmy Poole knew
about the locker
and she had a key.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.631
She would've had
to have gone there

32:45.664 --> 32:47.299
before the bones
were discovered.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.435
But after Petty
Officer Dobbs died

32:49.468 --> 32:51.103
so he couldn't defend himself.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.738
There's one problem,
though, boss.

32:52.771 --> 32:55.207
The computer shows that
Dobbs's entry and access code

32:55.241 --> 32:58.010
was used only once--
the time she was
with the manager.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.081
She could've used
somebody else's code.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.018
There's a surveillance camera
at the entry gate, boss.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.719
I know, McGee.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.488
McGEE:
That is why I am going

33:09.521 --> 33:11.123
to Little Creek.

33:11.157 --> 33:11.890
Avoid the 295-- it's packed.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.325
GIBBS:
DiNozzo, go with McGee.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.427
He's gonna pick up
the surveillance tape.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.662
Boss, I just...

33:21.167 --> 33:22.234
You're driving.

33:29.308 --> 33:33.412
You realize Mother Teresa would
have road rage hell out there?

33:33.445 --> 33:34.546
I know it's a long shot.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.549
A long shot is you getting laid
by Penelope Cruz, McGee.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.085
This is way beyond that.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.153
Look, Tony, I'm sorry, but
my instincts tell me...

33:41.187 --> 33:43.055
You have not been around
long enough to have

33:43.089 --> 33:44.823
instincts, Probie.
Well, I still
don't think

33:44.856 --> 33:47.459
that Petty Officer
Dobbs is a murderer.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.661
Why, because he was
a hero in Iraq?

33:49.695 --> 33:50.529
Yeah.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.732
They Came to Cordura.

33:53.765 --> 33:54.400
What?

33:54.433 --> 33:55.334
The film.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.069
Of course.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.106
Gary Cooper.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.073
Who?

34:01.107 --> 34:02.441
One of the greatest

34:02.474 --> 34:04.076
actors of all time?

34:04.110 --> 34:05.344
Coop.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.745
High Noon.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.381
They Came to Cordura
was one of his last pictures.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.849
Stick with me here.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.652
It's 1916--
the war against Pancho Villa.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.422
Coop plays an army major
escorting Rita Hayworth--

34:16.455 --> 34:18.757
mm, what a body--
and four Medal of Honor winners

34:18.790 --> 34:19.791
back to Texas for this...

34:19.825 --> 34:23.862
ceremony, and along the way,
he tries to determine

34:23.895 --> 34:26.098
what made them heroes.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.800
( elevator bell dings )
In the end,

34:28.834 --> 34:31.103
he exposes them for
what they really are:

34:31.137 --> 34:33.705
corrupt, pathetic, hypocritical,

34:33.739 --> 34:35.541
cowardly degenerates.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.509
DiNozzo, it's a movie.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.378
It's a film.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.812
You're taking
the stairs, McGee.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.214
Why?
'Cause I am
not riding

34:42.248 --> 34:43.515
in an elevator with anyone

34:43.549 --> 34:45.617
who doesn't know
who Gary Cooper was.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.223
Abby, can you tell
if anyone picked...

34:51.257 --> 34:52.158
Dobbs's padlock?

34:52.191 --> 34:52.724
Yes.
No.

34:52.758 --> 34:53.859
Abbs, I don't have time.

34:53.892 --> 34:55.127
I'm trying to tell you.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.162
I just checked it out.

34:56.195 --> 34:56.895
I knew you were gonna ask.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.164
It's scary, Gibbs--

34:58.197 --> 34:59.631
I'm starting
to think like you.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.233
The lock is almost virgin.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.835
It's hardly been opened,
and it shows no sign of wear.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.537
If it had been picked,
there'd be

35:05.571 --> 35:07.239
scratches on the tumblers.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.479
It was opened with a key.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.880
I would swear to it.

35:14.913 --> 35:16.815
Good work, Abbs.
I knew you were gonna
say that, too.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.551
ABBY:
He's the manufacturer's
service tech.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.520
He gets triple-time on weekends,
and it's gonna be a while.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.289
GIBBS:
Stay on him.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.257
So, what's the verdict?

35:25.291 --> 35:26.358
I'm done.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.594
Really? That was quick.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.229
It's a simple short.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.898
It's nothing you don't pick up
in an intro ITT class.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.533
Huh.

35:34.566 --> 35:37.336
I guess they don't offer that
at MIT.

35:37.369 --> 35:40.272
Any luck with
Emmy's psychiatrist?

35:40.306 --> 35:41.740
( laughs ):
It's Sunday, Gibbs.

35:41.773 --> 35:42.741
I know.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.244
As everyone keeps reminding me.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.679
Well, it wasn't
much of a challenge
finding you.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.616
I actually do like
to drink alone,

35:50.649 --> 35:52.751
but I figured you could
use a pick-me-up.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.491
You're not surprised
I found you here.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.660
No.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.962
No. Why should I be?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.464
Investigation's not over.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.798
It's a lost cause.

36:06.832 --> 36:07.966
You here to gloat?

36:07.999 --> 36:11.337
Actually, I happen
to believe in miracles.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.638
Oh, really.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.440
Yeah, I never had one
happen in front of me,

36:14.473 --> 36:16.275
so I figured if one
did, I'd like to be

36:16.308 --> 36:18.210
standing by
so I could call the Pentagon.

36:19.378 --> 36:23.282
Miracles take hard work,
Commander.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.452
Any particular desk
I should use?

36:37.296 --> 36:39.365
Special Agent DiNozzo

36:39.398 --> 36:42.368
will be gone
for a while.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.337
Agent Todd.

36:45.371 --> 36:46.438
GIBBS:
Richfield case file.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.545
Do you realize,
at this exact moment

36:53.579 --> 36:55.814
we would be in the throes
of deep tissue exhilaration?

36:55.847 --> 36:56.915
Don't remind me.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.284
You guys had spa plans?

36:58.317 --> 36:59.418
Yeah.
Last month

36:59.451 --> 37:01.453
a girlfriend and I went
to the new one in Charleston.

37:01.487 --> 37:02.888
Serenity Retreat?

37:03.622 --> 37:04.756
Ooh...
Ah...

37:04.790 --> 37:06.592
Are you here for a reason, Abby?

37:06.625 --> 37:07.326
I wanna talk dirt.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.794
McGEE:
Boss.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.296
I don't know if you
missed my lips moving,

37:10.329 --> 37:11.997
McGee, but actually,
I was speaking.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.032
According to my
newly repaired mass
spectrometer...

37:14.065 --> 37:16.335
Sorry, Abbs,
but this is big.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.270
Well, it could be big--
uh, at least

37:18.304 --> 37:19.271
we think it is.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.373
But if it is big,
it is really big.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.408
GIBBS:
McGee, talk.

37:22.441 --> 37:23.275
Make sense.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.377
We reviewed the entry gate
security tapes

37:25.411 --> 37:27.012
from Little Creek
Public Storage.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.281
Now, from the day that
Petty Officer Dobbs died

37:29.315 --> 37:31.283
to the day that
Nora Webb's remains were found,

37:31.317 --> 37:32.884
uh, no sign
of Emmy Poole entering.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.321
But I think
I recognize
someone else.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.422
It's grainy,

37:36.455 --> 37:39.325
but we're hoping
that Abby's capable
of enhancing it.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.401
McGEE:
This video was taken three days

37:49.435 --> 37:51.403
after Petty Officer Dobbs died
in Falluja.

37:51.437 --> 37:54.506
This guy opened up a locker
the same day, under the name

37:54.540 --> 37:56.375
John Weston.
'Kay, freeze it
right there.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.410
Any chance we can make
the driver, Abbs?

37:58.444 --> 38:00.446
Not a chance, Gibbs.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.314
A certainty.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.521
Webb.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.757
Were there any other
surveillance cameras
on the premises?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.892
No. Once he was in,
he could've gone to any locker.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.927
He would have to have known
which locker was Dobbs's.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.529
And he would have had
to have had a key,

38:17.563 --> 38:18.864
because the lock was not picked.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.432
Emmy Poole.

38:20.466 --> 38:21.967
Kate, McGee,
start backgrounding

38:22.000 --> 38:23.034
Bruce Webb.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.570
DiNozzo,
you're with me.

38:24.603 --> 38:25.804
Gibbs, Gibbs! My dirt.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.072
What about it?
Unless someone

38:27.105 --> 38:29.040
has been fertilizing
the forest,

38:29.074 --> 38:31.410
Nora Webb was not buried
in the woods.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.546
The soil found on her femur
contains chemicals consistent

38:34.580 --> 38:35.881
with plant food.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.429
( phone rings )

38:50.462 --> 38:53.031
Yeah. Gibbs.
Bruce Webb was
Nora's stepfather.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.400
Her biological father

38:54.433 --> 38:55.567
walked out when she was three.

38:55.601 --> 38:56.735
Nora took his name when

38:56.768 --> 38:57.903
he officially adopted her

38:57.936 --> 38:58.970
at the age of six.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.038
Nothing else yet,

39:00.071 --> 39:01.106
but we're working on it, Gibbs.

39:01.139 --> 39:01.607
( dial tone drones )

39:01.640 --> 39:02.140
He just cut you off?

39:02.173 --> 39:04.543
Does it to everyone.

39:05.677 --> 39:06.912
Wow. The Stepfather.

39:06.945 --> 39:07.979
You see that movie?

39:08.013 --> 39:09.981
Guy marries
a woman with a
gorgeous daughter.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.116
I thought
I made it clear.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.818
We have nothing
to say to NCIS.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.019
Tony.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.656
TONY:
I know. Security
video can be

39:17.689 --> 39:20.426
so darn unflattering.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.493
What's going on?

39:21.527 --> 39:23.529
GIBBS:
By tomorrow we'll have

39:23.562 --> 39:26.164
your fingerprints from the
storage locker rental agreement.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.500
We'll have a search
authorization to take

39:28.534 --> 39:30.168
soil samples
from the nursery

39:30.201 --> 39:34.072
and match them against
trace evidence from
Nora Webb's remains.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.642
I-I don't understand.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.977
You dug up and
you moved the body,

39:39.010 --> 39:40.979
because you were afraid
that the new owners

39:41.012 --> 39:42.748
of the nursery
would uncover it.

39:43.782 --> 39:46.151
Bruce?

39:50.055 --> 39:51.690
GIBBS:
Emmy Poole

39:51.723 --> 39:54.860
was an impressionable teenager,
raised by a single mom.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.695
Looking for

39:56.728 --> 39:58.464
a father figure.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.031
It wasn't like that.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.033
What was it like, Mr. Webb?

40:02.067 --> 40:05.070
Emmy was...

40:05.103 --> 40:08.440
always around.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.742
With Nora.

40:10.776 --> 40:15.547
I enjoyed... being with them.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.684
It was fun taking them places.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.719
As they got older,

40:20.752 --> 40:23.188
Emmy was...

40:23.221 --> 40:25.724
advanced.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.793
Sexually precocious.

40:30.228 --> 40:33.799
It all happened so gradual.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.471
And then one day,

40:39.505 --> 40:41.540
things got out of hand.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.711
I-I wanted to stop it,

40:45.744 --> 40:47.913
but...

40:51.182 --> 40:53.585
What happened that night?

40:56.688 --> 40:59.491
It was late.

40:59.525 --> 41:01.259
My wife was asleep.

41:01.292 --> 41:06.665
Emmy called to warn me that
Nora had found out about us.

41:06.698 --> 41:10.636
She was... hysterical.

41:10.669 --> 41:15.574
She and Emmy had gotten
into a fight at the party.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.512
Justin Dobbs

41:20.546 --> 41:23.081
didn't know
what the fight was about.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.251
He offered to drive Nora home.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.219
I couldn't let Nora

41:28.253 --> 41:31.056
tell her mother.

41:31.089 --> 41:33.525
I met her out front,

41:33.559 --> 41:36.161
and I tried to calm her.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.530
But she started screaming.

41:38.564 --> 41:39.831
I j...

41:39.865 --> 41:42.868
I put my hand over her mouth.

41:44.636 --> 41:47.505
But she wouldn't stop.

41:50.308 --> 41:52.644
( trembling sigh )

41:56.615 --> 41:59.651
I didn't mean to kill her.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.187
( crying quietly )

42:08.026 --> 42:10.596
( crying continues )

42:13.298 --> 42:15.701
You want to take it
from here, Chief?

42:21.840 --> 42:23.842
So I'm thinking about going

42:23.875 --> 42:26.177
to Petty Officer Dobbs's
funeral tomorrow.

42:26.211 --> 42:29.280
I've never witnessed
the awarding of a Silver Star.

42:29.314 --> 42:32.017
Would you like
to join me?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.885
Worked all weekend.

42:33.919 --> 42:37.288
Guess I could come in
a little late on Monday.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.963
They found Tony's car.

42:44.996 --> 42:46.998
McGEE:
It's on the I-40 in Oklahoma.

42:47.032 --> 42:49.134
NEWSMAN:
Chopper John is live
on the scene.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.202
CHOPPER JOHN:
That's right...
Pull over!

42:51.236 --> 42:52.638
You'll never get away.

42:52.671 --> 42:53.805
ABBY:
Kind of drives

42:53.839 --> 42:54.973
like Gibbs.

42:55.006 --> 42:57.976
( all gasping )
Whoa! Ooh!

42:58.009 --> 42:58.944
Oh!

42:58.977 --> 43:00.111
That's harsh.

43:00.145 --> 43:02.981
NEWSMAN:
Oh, my. Is that the driver?

43:03.014 --> 43:03.949
CHOPPER JOHN:
Yes, it is, Gray.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.651
I can't believe it,
he seems to be moving.

43:05.684 --> 43:07.352
He's somehow survived.

43:07.385 --> 43:10.288
NEWSMAN:
The same cannot be said
for the car, John.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.090
It's been completely demolished.

43:12.123 --> 43:13.892
Fiberglass.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.761
Not good for boats, either.

43:15.794 --> 43:17.328
The driver is now in custody...
Oh!

43:17.362 --> 43:18.396
Have a good weekend.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.230
ABBY:
Oh, Tony...

43:19.264 --> 43:20.832
KATE ( laughing ):
Tony,

43:20.866 --> 43:25.804
that sucks.
