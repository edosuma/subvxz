05:31.008 --> 05:31.974
Witnesses spotted this thing

05:31.976 --> 05:34.076
trying to plant
some kind of bomb downtown.

05:34.078 --> 05:38.847
When the cops confronted it,
it spewed fire from its mouth.

05:39.682 --> 05:43.051
Yeah, I noticed,
but fire's no problem for me.

05:43.053 --> 05:46.588
As I was saying,
Green Lantern can do anything.

05:46.590 --> 05:47.856
Except shut up, apparently.

- In a plane.

in a bat costume, are you?

06:15.652 --> 06:19.154
Are you freaking kidding me?

06:20.189 --> 06:22.624
What? Nobody asked you to prom,

06:22.626 --> 06:24.159
so now you dress as a bat

06:24.161 --> 06:26.795
and prowl around
your parents' basement?

06:26.797 --> 06:29.565

Huh?

06:30.701 --> 06:31.333
No buttons.

06:31.335 --> 06:33.802
I assume it works
off concentration.

06:33.804 --> 06:36.838
How'd you do that?

06:37.140 --> 06:40.208
You weren't concentrating.

06:42.011 --> 06:45.213
- You won't do that again.
- Unless I want to.

around the clock on this, Silas.

08:46.203 --> 08:47.836

08:47.838 --> 08:50.072
I'll rest when we know
what this device is

08:50.074 --> 08:53.475
and why that creature needed it
planted in central city.

08:53.477 --> 08:55.711
Now what do we know?

08:55.713 --> 08:58.180
It's broadcasting
some kind of signal,

08:58.182 --> 08:59.715

similar signals

08:59.717 --> 09:02.284

Gotham, and Metropolis.

I figured I'd see

09:11.028 --> 09:12.794
if you had any further
information regarding the device

09:12.796 --> 09:14.763

a few days ago.

to fall apart.

09:26.110 --> 09:27.242
Any further data on the device?

09:27.244 --> 09:30.178
Nothing yet. I should
know more in a few hours.

Awesome game today.

15:02.245 --> 15:03.845
Superstar Q.B. Victory Stone

15:03.847 --> 15:06.448
brings in the win
single-handedly.

15:06.450 --> 15:07.549
Nah, not quite.

15:07.551 --> 15:11.119
What do you mean? You threw
that last touchdown pass,

15:11.121 --> 15:11.653
like, 43 yards.

15:11.655 --> 15:13.555
Doesn't matter
if there's not someone

15:13.557 --> 15:16.624
on the other end
to make the catch.

15:16.692 --> 15:21.529
Must be nice to trust
someone else that much.

15:27.203 --> 15:28.369
Hey, I should go.

15:28.371 --> 15:29.804
Nice meeting you, Victory.

15:29.806 --> 15:32.607
Tell your dad
he's got some great seats.

15:32.609 --> 15:34.242
Yeah, I will.

15:34.244 --> 15:35.743
[Door closes]

15:38.214 --> 15:40.648
Hey, where's my...

15:40.650 --> 15:41.783
Son of a...

15:41.785 --> 15:43.518
Yes!

15:45.421 --> 15:48.556
Victory! Victory!

15:54.263 --> 15:55.463
Superman's close.

15:55.465 --> 15:57.432
I've been tracking
his flight path.

15:57.434 --> 16:01.402
[Scoffs] On what,
your own satellite?

16:03.239 --> 16:05.840
I was kidding.
You have a satellite?

16:05.842 --> 16:07.775
Here he comes.

16:13.249 --> 16:16.417
First one to the building is...
[Grappler whooshes]

16:17.219 --> 16:20.889
Uhh. I really hate that guy.

16:31.233 --> 16:32.734
[Explosion]
Wait here.

16:32.736 --> 16:34.702
I got this.

16:34.704 --> 16:35.470
No offense.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.205
You'd just get in the way.

16:37.207 --> 16:37.839
Here's the plan.

16:37.841 --> 16:40.742
Green Lantern
kicks Superman's ass.

16:40.744 --> 16:43.211
TMZ's got the video.

16:46.515 --> 16:47.549
[Explosions]

16:47.551 --> 16:49.918
[Grunting]

16:55.491 --> 16:56.791
Aah!

17:00.296 --> 17:01.763
[Groans]

17:03.732 --> 17:06.901
So what can you do?

17:16.878 --> 17:17.712
[Breathes]

17:17.714 --> 17:21.648
I can still see you.

17:24.520 --> 17:30.258
The creature that attacked me
had one of those boxes you have.

17:32.728 --> 17:35.263
A friend of yours, I assume.

17:35.265 --> 17:36.598
[Beeps]

17:39.568 --> 17:40.535
He blew up,

17:40.537 --> 17:43.438
so I'll ask you.

17:50.246 --> 17:51.879
[Breathes]

17:58.754 --> 18:00.488
[Grenade shrieking]

18:12.301 --> 18:15.470
What are these boxes for?

18:15.472 --> 18:17.805
Talk while you still can.

18:17.807 --> 18:21.276
[Grunts] Trying to.

18:21.278 --> 18:23.544
Round 2, flyboy.

18:26.915 --> 18:27.915
[Grunts]

18:27.917 --> 18:30.752
Lantern, no!

18:38.460 --> 18:39.394
Chains?

18:39.396 --> 18:40.795
You're funny.

18:40.797 --> 18:44.299
[Grunts]

18:46.935 --> 18:47.835
We won't stop him.

18:47.837 --> 18:50.972
He's pissed off.
We have to talk to him.

18:50.974 --> 18:52.607
Talk to him?

19:12.995 --> 19:13.795
Lantern, focus.

19:13.797 --> 19:16.964
You stop concentrating,
and that shield breaks apart.

19:16.966 --> 19:18.866
Shut up.

19:19.902 --> 19:22.570
[People screaming]

19:29.111 --> 19:30.111
This guy's gonna kill us.

19:30.113 --> 19:33.915
No, he won't.
You bruise, but you don't kill,

19:33.917 --> 19:35.483
do you...

19:35.485 --> 19:37.552
Clark?

19:39.588 --> 19:42.757
You've made your point...

19:42.759 --> 19:45.593
Heh. Bruce Wayne.

19:45.595 --> 19:47.962
Who the hell is Bruce Wayne?

19:47.964 --> 19:49.764
We think it's alien.

19:49.766 --> 19:52.500
Well, it's not Kryptonian.

19:52.502 --> 19:53.034
Worth a shot.

19:53.036 --> 19:55.970
Hey, hey, what happened?
We're done fighting?

19:55.972 --> 19:58.072
Alien is relative, by the way.

19:58.074 --> 19:59.941
It's a big universe.

19:59.943 --> 20:01.976
[Helicopter whirring]

20:04.380 --> 20:05.913
Let's move.

20:08.450 --> 20:10.618
Man, what is it
with you and sewers?

20:10.620 --> 20:13.788
Someone is strategically placing
these boxes.

20:13.790 --> 20:18.960
We have to find out who
and why before it's too late.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.435
[Woman screams]

20:28.103 --> 20:31.439
Desaad,
what do you have to report

20:31.441 --> 20:32.707
from our agents on earth?

20:32.709 --> 20:36.978
Sire, the powerful one
has found a mother box,

20:36.980 --> 20:41.549
the one they
mistakenly call Superman.

20:42.084 --> 20:43.117
And?

20:43.119 --> 20:45.520
These defenders have
sprung up like antibodies

20:45.522 --> 20:49.023
to protect their planet.
We are in danger of losing

20:49.025 --> 20:50.758
the element of surprise,
my lord.

20:50.760 --> 20:54.962
I humbly ask that you
move up your timetable.

20:56.098 --> 20:58.766
Let the invasion begin.

21:01.537 --> 21:03.871
We're maxed at power ceiling.

21:03.873 --> 21:05.640
Cycle the pulses.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.744
Dr. Stone,

21:09.746 --> 21:10.511
your son is here.

21:10.513 --> 21:14.015
I don't have time right now.
Do it again.

21:14.017 --> 21:14.682
Make time.

21:14.684 --> 21:16.951
Victor, I'm in the middle

21:16.953 --> 21:18.519
of some very important work.

21:18.521 --> 21:20.822
You mean
more important than me.

21:21.095 --> 21:23.328
That's not what I said.

21:23.330 --> 21:25.864
There were scouts there
today, dad.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.866
They offered me a full ride,
all of them.

21:28.907 --> 21:31.007
I told you
I'll pay for college.

21:31.009 --> 21:33.243
You don't need to be sniffing
after a scholarship.

21:33.245 --> 21:34.777
That's not the point.

21:34.779 --> 21:38.879
They think I can hold my own
with the best of the best.

21:38.918 --> 21:40.518
Why don't you?

21:40.520 --> 21:42.605
Open your eyes, son.

21:42.721 --> 21:44.721
Look at the world
we live in today.

21:44.723 --> 21:48.025
We are witnessing the birth
of a new race of superhumans,

21:48.027 --> 21:50.328
beings who can fly,
tear through buildings,

21:50.330 --> 21:51.762
and outrun race cars.

21:51.764 --> 21:54.698
They will make
what you can do obsolete.

21:55.100 --> 21:59.536
In that world,
throwing a football is a joke.

22:00.304 --> 22:03.674
You're never gonna come
to one of my games, are you?

22:03.776 --> 22:05.576
[Buzzer blaring]

22:05.578 --> 22:06.544
No.

22:06.946 --> 22:09.480
Dr. Stone,
something's happening.

22:09.782 --> 22:12.516
We can talk about this later.

22:17.288 --> 22:21.258
So why are you two here?
Metropolis is my turf.

22:21.260 --> 22:25.896
There have been reports of mysterious
kidnappings across the country.

22:25.898 --> 22:27.323
We had 'em here, too.

22:27.366 --> 22:29.166
Figured that was life
in the big city.

22:29.168 --> 22:31.969
You think the disappearances
and these things are connected?

22:31.971 --> 22:33.404
They're connected.

22:33.551 --> 22:35.017
So these monsters, they're...

22:35.018 --> 22:37.818
They're soldiers,
expendable soldiers at that,

22:37.820 --> 22:40.254
planting these devices
at all costs.

22:40.256 --> 22:41.255
That's military tactics.

22:41.257 --> 22:43.891
We might be
staring down the barrel

22:43.893 --> 22:45.226
of a full-scale invasion.

22:45.228 --> 22:46.060
You're paranoid.

22:46.062 --> 22:50.131
Let's just crack it open
and see what happens.

22:50.133 --> 22:50.665
Hey!

22:50.667 --> 22:53.301
Without any idea
what's inside?

22:53.303 --> 22:54.936
That's idiotic.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.605
Heh. I'll show you idiotic.

[Humming]

22:58.908 --> 23:00.675
Ahh! I didn't touch it.

23:00.677 --> 23:02.810
It's activated itself.

23:02.812 --> 23:04.045
It's transmitting.

23:04.047 --> 23:05.680
Silas, look at these readings.

23:05.682 --> 23:09.083
I am not letting you
walk away from me again, dad.

23:09.085 --> 23:10.017
We're having this out.

23:10.019 --> 23:11.252
Silas: Can we trace
the power source?

23:11.254 --> 23:14.355
I'm trying to lock in
on the signal now.

23:14.623 --> 23:17.258
This thing
is more important to you

23:17.260 --> 23:18.826
than your own son?

23:18.828 --> 23:20.661
Victor, stop!

24:25.761 --> 24:28.162
Still think I'm paranoid?

24:28.164 --> 24:31.298
Ah, maybe a little less now.

[Alarm blaring]

24:49.451 --> 24:52.687
[Gasps]

25:00.462 --> 25:02.697
We need to get
out of here now.

25:02.699 --> 25:03.164
Which way?

25:03.166 --> 25:06.834
We have to get him
into the red room.

I'm not leaving you, Victor.

25:43.005 --> 25:45.740
Don't you dare leave me.

25:46.141 --> 25:48.476
[Snarling]

25:55.283 --> 25:56.183
I don't believe it.

25:56.185 --> 25:59.487
His vitals are there, Silas.
He's alive.

26:02.424 --> 26:05.459
[Groans]

26:05.461 --> 26:06.093
Dad.

26:06.095 --> 26:07.995
Yes, Victor. I'm here.

26:07.997 --> 26:10.831
Ahh. It hurts so bad.

26:10.833 --> 26:11.932
It's going to hurt.

26:11.934 --> 26:14.468
It's not gonna be easy, but...

26:14.470 --> 26:16.070
[screams]

26:16.072 --> 26:17.004
Whatever that energy is,

26:17.006 --> 26:19.206
it's eating him
from the inside out.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.842
He's going into cardiac arrest.

26:21.844 --> 26:24.278
It's racing up his spinal cord.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.347
Then we can't wait.

26:29.985 --> 26:31.919
[Yells]

26:31.921 --> 26:33.187
But, Silas, the risk.

26:33.189 --> 26:34.221
What choice so I have, morrow?

26:34.223 --> 26:37.124
This room contains technology
recovered from across the globe.

26:37.126 --> 26:39.460
I've studied and logged
nearly everything in here.

26:39.462 --> 26:42.062
I've taken apart
and rebuilt most of it.

26:42.064 --> 26:44.398
It can save my son's life.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.966
It has to.

26:57.879 --> 27:00.181

27:05.587 --> 27:08.122
He's in pain.
You have to do something.

27:08.124 --> 27:10.858
The pain will subside
as soon as the promethium

27:10.860 --> 27:12.426
finishes replacing
the damaged tissue.

27:12.428 --> 27:13.894
Promethium skin grafts?

27:13.896 --> 27:16.330
His body could
reject them completely.

27:16.332 --> 27:17.064
It won't.

27:17.066 --> 27:19.166
I've injected the nanites.
Activate them.

27:19.168 --> 27:21.836
They're untested.
We recovered them from...

with me, Hannah.

You're not afraid of me.

28:11.354 --> 28:14.555
Nah. I wanna be you
when I get big.

28:14.557 --> 28:17.925
I would welcome
your sisterhood, Hannah.

28:17.927 --> 28:19.326
What are you eating?

28:19.328 --> 28:21.362
Ice cream.

28:21.963 --> 28:22.596
Is it good?

28:22.598 --> 28:25.532
It's the greatest food
in the world,

28:25.534 --> 28:27.668
if you ask me.

28:29.037 --> 28:30.304
Aww.

28:30.906 --> 28:33.073
I will try some ice cream,

28:33.075 --> 28:36.543
and another
for my friend Hannah.

28:37.145 --> 28:38.045
Whatever you say, lady.

28:38.047 --> 28:42.149
Just don't, you know,
take my arm with it.

28:42.151 --> 28:44.184
Eh, here.

28:49.124 --> 28:52.293
Ice cream is wonderful!

28:53.428 --> 28:55.429
Told you so.

28:56.064 --> 28:59.934
You should be very proud
of this achievement.

Um, thanks?

[Steady tone whining]

29:05.641 --> 29:07.641

29:07.643 --> 29:11.145
I promised his mother
I'd protect him,

but I failed.

Steve, have you
ever had ice cream?

29:43.346 --> 29:46.480
This cook is truly blessed.

29:46.482 --> 29:49.249
You need to come back
to the white house.

29:49.251 --> 29:50.184
You sound like my mother.

29:50.186 --> 29:52.686
The president only has
a few minutes to meet you.

29:52.688 --> 29:56.090
I grew weary of waiting
for him, so I left.

29:56.092 --> 29:57.524
This is Hannah.

30:16.245 --> 30:21.081
Oh. I could compel you
to disclose this secret.

51:08.495 --> 51:11.330
We're just somewhat alike.

51:11.332 --> 51:12.732
We are nothing alike.

51:12.734 --> 51:14.800
We're fighting alongside
an alien, an Amazon,

51:14.802 --> 51:17.803
a human lightning bolt,
a Cyborg, and a Speedster.

51:17.805 --> 51:20.339
Far as I can tell, Hal,
you and I

51:20.341 --> 51:21.841
are the only normal people here.

51:21.843 --> 51:24.810
I never told you my name.

51:24.812 --> 51:26.545
Saw it on your flight suit.

51:26.547 --> 51:30.283
You're pretty
south of normal, spooky.

51:30.285 --> 51:32.518
You know that, right?

51:32.719 --> 51:33.619
My name is Bruce Wayne.

51:33.621 --> 51:37.657
When I was 10, my parents were
murdered in front of my eyes.

51:37.659 --> 51:39.425
I've spent my life
training to fight

51:39.427 --> 51:42.628
the same sort of criminals
that took them from me,

51:42.630 --> 51:44.964
but this, this is different.

51:44.966 --> 51:46.299
This isn't about me.

51:46.301 --> 51:49.068
Uh, you're
telling me this why?

51:49.070 --> 51:53.339
This is bigger than I am,
and it's bigger than you are.

51:53.341 --> 51:54.573
Get out of your own way.

51:54.575 --> 51:58.744
Focus on what's important here,
everyone else.

51:58.746 --> 51:59.645
Regroup with the others.

51:59.647 --> 52:01.681
- And do what, exactly?
- You're loud.

52:01.683 --> 52:05.384
They'll listen to you
if you got something to say.

52:05.386 --> 52:07.920
Try to at least sound smart.

52:08.722 --> 52:09.455
Keep them alive.

52:09.457 --> 52:11.724
Keep darkseid busy
till I get back.

52:11.726 --> 52:13.392
Get back? From where?

52:13.394 --> 52:16.896
We won't win
without our big gun.

52:19.666 --> 52:22.601
Where the hell are you going?

52:23.804 --> 52:24.737
Hey!

52:24.739 --> 52:26.439
[Whistles]

52:26.441 --> 52:29.709
I'm going to get Superman.

52:30.711 --> 52:33.379
Bruce Wayne, huh?

52:34.348 --> 52:37.483
Moron's crazier than I am.

53:23.163 --> 53:25.131
You guys ok? Good.

53:25.133 --> 53:27.400
Listen up

53:27.402 --> 53:29.168
uh...

53:29.936 --> 53:31.771
Ahem!

53:31.773 --> 53:33.739
We need to, uh...

53:33.741 --> 53:35.574
We need to play offense

53:35.576 --> 53:38.944
instead of all
coming up to bat.

53:39.679 --> 53:40.880
Um, what?

53:40.882 --> 53:44.450
I apologize,
but I don't know your games.

53:44.452 --> 53:45.918
I think
what lantern is saying

53:45.920 --> 53:48.120
is that it's time
for some teamwork,

53:48.122 --> 53:50.523
so let's pull it together.

53:50.525 --> 53:53.793
Yeah, baby! Clap it up!

53:56.663 --> 53:58.431
What's the plan, then?

53:58.433 --> 53:58.864
Well...

53:58.866 --> 54:01.700
He blasts those beams
out of his eyes, right?

54:01.702 --> 54:03.969
It's settled, then.
We blind him.

54:03.971 --> 54:07.072
That's as good a plan
as any, yeah.

54:07.074 --> 54:09.175
We follow,
and we stay out of sight.

54:09.177 --> 54:12.211
I'll turn on the fireworks
to get his attention.

54:12.213 --> 54:14.180
Princess, you get
in striking distance

54:14.182 --> 54:16.982
and stab that son of a bitch
in the eyes.

54:16.984 --> 54:18.851
Like poor damned Oedipus.

54:18.853 --> 54:20.886
Yeah, what
the hot Greek chick said.

54:20.888 --> 54:24.757
And the invasion of monsters
raining from the sky?

54:24.759 --> 54:26.225
What about them?

54:26.593 --> 54:28.093
I might be able to send them

54:28.095 --> 54:29.762
back where they came from.

54:29.764 --> 54:31.497
Good enough for me.

54:31.499 --> 54:33.032
Here we go, team.

54:33.034 --> 54:35.468
We got this!

54:39.606 --> 54:40.940
"We got this"?

54:40.942 --> 54:42.074
That's your big battle cry?

54:42.076 --> 54:45.711
Don't worry about it,
smartass. Stick to the plan.

54:47.814 --> 54:48.581
This is awesome.

54:48.583 --> 54:49.982
Like that Parker game
in overtime,

54:49.984 --> 54:51.250

- Sure you are.
- I'm not.

55:02.163 --> 55:03.963
I'm a Terminator, an android,

55:03.965 --> 55:07.533
some kind of Cyborg.
Now I'm gonna have to worry

55:07.535 --> 55:09.235
about operating systems
and computer viruses.

55:09.237 --> 55:12.538
Spoiler... you won't get
to do any of that stuff

55:12.540 --> 55:14.139

55:14.141 --> 55:15.007

56:20.908 --> 56:23.576
But here
in my personal laboratory,

56:23.578 --> 56:26.946
I can splice
your Kryptonian genetic code

56:26.948 --> 56:28.314
to create a new form,

56:28.316 --> 56:35.020
a super parademon
in the service of darkseid.

56:35.022 --> 56:37.623

56:42.062 --> 56:43.629

I had him.

feel anything ever again.

01:11:42.529 --> 01:11:44.896
It'll be our secret.

01:11:44.898 --> 01:11:48.666
I always said you had
an arm like a Cannon.

01:11:48.668 --> 01:11:51.970
Now you totally do.

01:11:51.972 --> 01:11:54.038
[Sighs]

01:12:05.951 --> 01:12:07.752
Nice job, kid.

01:12:07.754 --> 01:12:09.821
Where'd Shazam go?

01:12:09.823 --> 01:12:10.788
He took off,

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:12.056
said he had a hot date.

01:12:12.058 --> 01:12:15.827
Right. Who'd go out
with that immature hothead?

01:12:15.829 --> 01:12:17.862
What about the human victims?

01:12:17.864 --> 01:12:18.630
I can see them.

01:12:18.632 --> 01:12:23.234
Let me just get this baby
to boom for me one more time.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.908
I got this.

01:12:31.043 --> 01:12:34.212
[Screaming]

01:12:36.615 --> 01:12:39.117
He's good for cleanup,
at least.

01:12:39.119 --> 01:12:42.186
How do we keep
darkseid from returning?

01:12:42.188 --> 01:12:43.888
All those mother boxes
are fried.

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:46.791
Then they won't be able
to get back anytime soon.

01:12:46.793 --> 01:12:48.726
- It's a start.
- [Crowd murmuring]

01:12:48.728 --> 01:12:50.128
Heads up.

01:12:51.697 --> 01:12:52.764
There they are.

01:12:52.766 --> 01:12:57.702
We should leave before
they blame us again. Ugh.

01:12:57.704 --> 01:12:58.236
[Cheering]

01:12:58.238 --> 01:13:01.639
- You guys are amazing.
- [Overlapping chatter]

01:13:01.641 --> 01:13:04.075
What's your hurry, Flash?

01:13:05.578 --> 01:13:09.347
Today marks a momentous day
in human history.

01:13:09.349 --> 01:13:13.117
In our darkest hour,
these superheroes

01:13:13.119 --> 01:13:15.119
donned their
colorful costumes...

01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:16.921
- Costume?
- Took to the streets...

01:13:16.923 --> 01:13:18.690
- This is my uniform.
- Quiet.

01:13:18.692 --> 01:13:20.091
Oh, now you wanna bark orders?

01:13:20.093 --> 01:13:23.094
After I did the heavy lifting
and pulled everyone together.

01:13:23.096 --> 01:13:26.631
You're referring to when you
botched my very simple directives

01:13:26.633 --> 01:13:28.600
and Wonder Woman led the charge?

01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:30.201
Cyborg showed you a video?

01:13:30.203 --> 01:13:31.903
He e-mailed it to me.

01:13:31.905 --> 01:13:33.071
I really hate you, bats.

01:13:33.073 --> 01:13:36.107
I can't believe people
are no longer afraid of us.

01:13:36.109 --> 01:13:38.343
Or that they think
we're a team.

01:13:38.345 --> 01:13:39.177
We're not a team.

01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:42.080
But I am pleased to meet
some folks who get me.

01:13:42.082 --> 01:13:46.184
Yes, it was good to walk
among a pantheon again.

01:13:46.186 --> 01:13:47.685
How do you mean?

01:13:47.687 --> 01:13:49.253
Hades, Apollo,

01:13:49.255 --> 01:13:52.123
Hermes, Hephaestus, Zeus,

01:13:52.125 --> 01:13:55.126
each a god in their own right.

01:13:55.128 --> 01:13:56.294
And me?

01:13:56.296 --> 01:14:00.665
I have never met
anyone like you, Superman,

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:02.066
god or mortal.

01:14:02.068 --> 01:14:02.934
At this time.

01:14:02.936 --> 01:14:05.336
Is it by chance, by fate,

01:14:05.338 --> 01:14:08.072
or are there
bigger forces at work?

01:14:08.074 --> 01:14:11.075
Is our modern
technological age...

01:14:11.077 --> 01:14:12.110
I shouldn't be up here.

01:14:12.112 --> 01:14:15.680
Are you kidding me?
Of course you should. We won.

01:14:15.682 --> 01:14:18.282
Be proud.
Your dad looks like he is.

01:14:18.284 --> 01:14:20.818
In fact,
the way of all people,

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:23.821
working for
a free and peaceful planet.

01:14:23.823 --> 01:14:25.423
As we have seen...

01:14:25.425 --> 01:14:26.224
By the way, man,

01:14:26.226 --> 01:14:29.861
thanks for not talking
about the other thing.

01:14:29.863 --> 01:14:31.095
Don't sweat it,

01:14:31.097 --> 01:14:33.665
and thanks
for seeing me in here.

01:14:33.667 --> 01:14:36.100
What?
You're the bomb, Victory.

01:14:36.102 --> 01:14:39.237
I know. I know.
You keep reminding me.

01:14:39.239 --> 01:14:42.206
Victory. Victory.

01:14:42.208 --> 01:14:44.242
Victory.

01:14:44.244 --> 01:14:45.843
These super friends

01:14:45.845 --> 01:14:48.913
used their superpowers
to protect us...

01:14:48.915 --> 01:14:50.715
And we're not friends either.

01:14:50.717 --> 01:14:52.984
- We let them think we're both.
- Why?

01:14:52.986 --> 01:14:55.820
It'll keep Gotham P.D.
Off my back,

01:14:55.822 --> 01:14:57.288
the air force off yours.

01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:58.923
I don't know. A team?

01:14:58.925 --> 01:15:02.193
I've got a lot
of responsibilities.

01:15:02.195 --> 01:15:02.827
As do I.

01:15:02.829 --> 01:15:04.195
Well, I have a whole universe

01:15:04.197 --> 01:15:06.230
to protect, people,
so there you go.

01:15:06.232 --> 01:15:08.399
Come on.
We can do it together.

01:15:08.401 --> 01:15:11.035
Yeah? Can you fly into space?

01:15:11.037 --> 01:15:12.070
I can.

01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:12.904
Not my point. Look,

01:15:12.906 --> 01:15:15.707
we are not friends.
We're not a team.

01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:16.407
I don't agree, Hal.

01:15:16.409 --> 01:15:19.444
I kind of liked
being a part of something.

01:15:19.446 --> 01:15:20.211
Yeah, you would.

01:15:20.213 --> 01:15:22.747
Listen, this was just
a one-time deal, ok?

01:15:22.749 --> 01:15:25.316
And what if something
like this should happen again?

01:15:25.318 --> 01:15:28.319
Please.
What could possibly happen?

01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:31.089
That said, I am very pleased

01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:32.256
to introduce to you...

01:15:32.258 --> 01:15:34.125
Gee, I didn't even ask.

01:15:34.127 --> 01:15:36.094
Do you guys have a name?

01:15:36.096 --> 01:15:37.462
- Yes, we do.
- We do?

01:15:37.464 --> 01:15:40.231
That's right.
You can call us...

01:15:40.233 --> 01:15:41.132
The super seven.

01:15:41.134 --> 01:15:43.334
- [Groaning]
- Please don't call us that.

01:15:43.336 --> 01:15:45.837
- Hera help us.
- The super seven?

01:15:45.839 --> 01:15:48.272
What? You don't like it?

01:15:48.874 --> 01:15:51.409
[Orchestra playing]

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:28.472
[Rumbling approaches]

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:43.888
The surface dwellers
have killed our king.

01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:48.593
This is an act of war,
and they will pay.

01:17:49.962 --> 01:17:52.530
