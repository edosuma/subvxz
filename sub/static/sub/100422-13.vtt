00:45.145 --> 00:46.976
Elmer, stop.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.481
I don't want you
getting too close.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.313
- What's gonna happen?
- I don't know.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.354
It just fills me with dread.

00:55.422 --> 00:58.357
Can you see what it is?

00:58.425 --> 01:01.553
Looks like Henri,
from down in the valley.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.400
Item two, boys.

01:13.473 --> 01:14.963
The North West Mounted Police

01:15.041 --> 01:17.134
have asked us to keep an eye out
for this man.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.440
He's a confidence artist
who goes by Claude Benoit.

01:19.512 --> 01:20.604
Watch yourselves.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.012
He's considered
armed and dangerous.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.143
Well, then, sir,
goodbye and thank you.

01:26.219 --> 01:27.914
Ah, do consider our proposal.

01:27.987 --> 01:29.648
We can use
an ambitious man like you

01:29.722 --> 01:30.984
representing the constabulary.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.855
I'll need to discuss it
with the wife, obviously.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.725
Of course. Of course.
You take your time.

01:36.796 --> 01:40.129
Appointments won't be made
until the spring.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.566
- Detective Murdoch.
- Chief Constable.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.802
"Appointments"?

01:44.871 --> 01:46.532
They're looking
for an active copper

01:46.606 --> 01:47.698
for the Board of Commissioners.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.536
"They"?

01:48.608 --> 01:51.202
Men with the means
to make their will manifest.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.973
Ah. And what will they be
wanting you to do for them?

01:54.047 --> 01:56.538
"Congratulations, Inspector. "
"Why, thank you, Murdoch. "

01:56.616 --> 01:58.516
"It's well-deserved, sir. "
"Oh, you're too kind. "

01:58.585 --> 01:59.517
- Sir?
- What?!

01:59.586 --> 02:01.213
Constable Crabtree
has just telegraphed.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.346
There's been a suspicious death
up in Rouge Valley.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.050
He asked that you
bring your boots, sir.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.116
Toodle, pip.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.257
What do we have, George?

02:14.334 --> 02:16.495
Henri Gaston.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.803
Suicide, eh?
Why call for me?

02:19.873 --> 02:21.807
Well, actually, sir,
upon arriving at the scene,

02:21.875 --> 02:24.139
I realized I should check
for the victim's footprints,

02:24.210 --> 02:25.302
to eliminate foul play.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.141
However, there were none.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.706
- No footprints?
- No.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.113
Not besides those of myself

02:31.184 --> 02:32.845
and the farmer
who discovered the body.

02:32.919 --> 02:36.411
As you can see, his end
about 20 yards shy of the tree.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.787
You're certain
there are no other footprints

02:38.858 --> 02:40.325
leading to
or away from the tree?

02:40.393 --> 02:42.054
None.
I've checked several times.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.562
And when was
this field plowed, George?

02:44.631 --> 02:45.962
Yesterday morning.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.329
So there's no chance the farmer

02:47.400 --> 02:49.527
would have missed
seeing the body then?

02:49.602 --> 02:51.229
Well, I can't imagine.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.602
Hmm. Curious.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.200
So just how did you get
into that tree, Mr. Gaston?

03:06.452 --> 03:08.716
Full rigor mortis
has not yet set in.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.881
So he died relatively recently.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.050
Within the last eight hours
or so.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.791
So this confirms he died
after the field was plowed.

03:18.865 --> 03:23.393
I won't know until Dr. Ogden
performs the full postmortem.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.700
In the meantime, see what you
can find out about Mr. Gaston.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.832
I'll be back on the 4:00
from Toronto.

03:28.908 --> 03:30.466
- Sir.
- Oh, and George...

03:30.543 --> 03:32.875
See if you can round up
a couple of bicycles for us.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.208
Sir.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.084
Ligature marks.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.989
And some superficial wounds
to the arms and hands.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.926
- Were they defensive?
- No, they seem random.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.327
Most likely from
the branches of the tree.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.491
The longest runs from the back
of the arm to the scapula.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.330
Mmh.
And time of death?

03:56.402 --> 03:59.371
Between 2:00 and 4:00 A.M.
last night.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.566
That's consistent
with what I thought.

04:01.641 --> 04:02.903
Does that trouble you?

04:02.976 --> 04:04.705
It means that he climbed
into the tree

04:04.777 --> 04:06.404
before the field was plowed.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.414
Waited all day and most of the
night before hanging himself.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.575
And in my experience,
suicidal individuals,

04:11.651 --> 04:13.915
if given enough time,
will likely change their minds.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.716
But this wasn't suicide.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.221
Oh?
What makes you say that?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.416
Mr. Gaston's neck was broken

04:19.492 --> 04:21.221
between the second
and third vertebrae.

04:21.293 --> 04:24.695
Such a break would require
a dead drop of 7 or 8 feet.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.356
Ah, yes.
The hangman's calculation.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.559
If the rope is too short,
the neck doesn't break...

04:28.635 --> 04:30.535
Too long, the head comes off.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.537
It's quite a precise art,
actually.

04:32.605 --> 04:37.633
But in this case, the scarf was
too short to cause the break.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.613
So his neck was broken
before he was hung in the tree.

04:41.681 --> 04:42.739
A most elaborate attempt

04:42.815 --> 04:45.010
to make it seem like a suicide,
I should say.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.416
Why would anyone go
to such efforts?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.227
Ah, George.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.490
Have you found out anything more
about our victim yet?

04:57.563 --> 04:58.621
Very little so far.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.632
Mr. Gaston
liked to keep to himself.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.634
He was a bit of an odd duck
by all accounts.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.761
- Any enemies?
- None that I could determine.

05:04.837 --> 05:06.737
There's a sister who lives here
in the village.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.239
Oh.
Have you interviewed her yet?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.333
I thought you'd like to
speak to her yourself, sir.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.399
Very good.

05:22.021 --> 05:25.081
I haven't
known what to do with myself.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.524
I try to stay busy, but...

05:28.394 --> 05:30.726
I'm very sorry for your loss.

05:30.797 --> 05:35.257
Henri was so clever,
but his mind, it, um...

05:35.335 --> 05:37.667
- It troubled him.
- How so?

05:37.737 --> 05:40.399
He stopped talking to people.

05:40.473 --> 05:41.565
Even me.

05:42.809 --> 05:45.539
He stayed in his shop,
and he wouldn't come out.

05:45.611 --> 05:46.771
His shop?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.710
He was, um, an artisan.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.115
He worked with wood.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.882
But he didn't even
do that anymore.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.824
He would have
lost the business soon.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.156
But I never thought
he would hang himself.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.726
Miss Gaston.

06:05.798 --> 06:09.234
We have reason to believe
that someone killed your brother

06:09.302 --> 06:12.135
and placed his body in the tree.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.901
Do you know of anyone who might
have wanted to harm him?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.168
No.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.732
The last few times
I talked to him,

06:17.810 --> 06:19.209
he told me
someone was after him.

06:19.278 --> 06:22.145
But I just thought it...

06:28.988 --> 06:31.320
There's no way
you could have known.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.859
I should have believed him.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.259
He was telling the truth.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.025
Ah, George.

06:43.102 --> 06:45.002
We'll need to go and visit
Mr. Gaston's shop.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.005
Have you procured those bicycles
like I asked?

06:47.073 --> 06:50.474
Not quite.
But meet Gertrude and Whitey.

06:50.543 --> 06:53.034
Gertrude here is named after
the owner's late mother,

06:53.112 --> 06:56.172
and Whitey...
Whitey's all white.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.610
Very good, George.

07:02.688 --> 07:05.657
Well, Gertrude, let's see
what you're up for, eh?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.210
Have you never
ridden a horse before?

07:25.278 --> 07:28.839
Um, we had a Shetland pony
when I was a child, sir.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.349
George, every constable is
expected to know how to ride.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.782
How did you get your job?

07:32.852 --> 07:36.686
Uh, I may have exaggerated
my equestrian prowess, sir.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.155
Squeeze your legs together.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.851
Hurry up.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.660
I've been doing some thinking

07:47.733 --> 07:49.894
about how Mr. Gaston
ended up in the tree.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.493
What conclusions
have you arrived at?

07:51.571 --> 07:53.766
Well, most of my conclusions
I've had to rule out

07:53.840 --> 07:55.705
due to sheer impossibility.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.107
But the most feasible solution
I've come to

07:58.177 --> 08:00.042
is that he was
shot out of a cannon.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.340
A cannon?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.814
I once saw the Great Farini
fire a man out of a cannon.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.783
100-and-some feet he flew.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.479
Well, the man was a she,

08:07.553 --> 08:09.748
and she wasn't actually fired
from the cannon.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.255
I beg to differ, sir.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.884
There was an explosion, fire,
smoke coming out of the barrel,

08:13.960 --> 08:15.257
along with one human projectile.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.262
The firing mechanism
was a spring,

08:17.330 --> 08:20.356
and the smoke and fire
were merely effects.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.400
Are you sure?

08:21.467 --> 08:23.367
Quite certain.
I inspected it myself.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.338
I wouldn't have pegged you
for a circusgoer, sir.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.600
I was a boy once too, George.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.164
The only boy at the circus

08:30.243 --> 08:31.870
inspecting the equipment, I bet.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.182
The windows
have been boarded shut.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.880
Why would Mr. Gaston do that?

08:41.953 --> 08:43.818
He believed
someone was after him.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.953
This is where he worked?

08:47.026 --> 08:50.052
Yes, and likely lived
from the looks of it.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.660
A telescope.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.898
Not just any telescope.
A very powerful one.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.233
And a shotgun.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.600
Looks like
he was ready for trouble.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.910
"September 7th... Lights. "

09:09.982 --> 09:12.075
"September 19th... Circle. "

09:12.151 --> 09:13.948
What's this?

09:14.020 --> 09:15.681
Well, this is a map of the area.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.019
He's notated it,
for some reason.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.955
And these are charts
of the solar system.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.392
An amateur astronomer, then?

09:22.461 --> 09:23.450
Possibly.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.689
But it seems as though
Mr. Gaston's interests

09:26.766 --> 09:28.893
were focused on Mars.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.534
Sir.
Listen to this.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.430
This must be his journal.
He's kept a letter.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.668
"Dear Mr. Gaston,

09:36.742 --> 09:40.974
Many thanks for your thoughts
re possibility of life on Mars.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.947
Agreed that such existed.

09:43.015 --> 09:45.882
Whether or not said life is
extant remains to be determined,

09:45.952 --> 09:49.752
but your observations require,
nay demand, further study.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.347
Your fellow scientist,
Percival Lowell. "

09:52.425 --> 09:55.360
He's the leading expert on Mars.
Published a book about it.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.589
Right. He's the one who saw
the canals on the surface.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.995
Well, claims to have seen.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.296
At any rate,
keep Mr. Gaston's journal.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.562
Perhaps he wrote something in it

10:03.636 --> 10:05.695
that'll give us a clue
as to who was after him.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.204
Sir, you think his observations

10:07.273 --> 10:08.638
had something to do
with his death?

10:08.708 --> 10:10.699
Possibly, but I suspect
the reason for his death

10:10.776 --> 10:12.869
is decidedly more terrestrial.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.647
Well, it wasn't just
Mr. Gaston's land we were after.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.020
We were buying the whole valley,

10:25.091 --> 10:27.082
from Steeles Avenue
to Plug Hat Road.

10:27.159 --> 10:30.026
Yes.
For... For what purpose?

10:30.096 --> 10:31.688
Come and see for yourself.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.595
Thank you.

10:33.666 --> 10:37.124
Our plan was to dam
the Rouge River here,

10:37.203 --> 10:40.400
where we would then build an
electrical generating station.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.873
That would flood all of
the lands in the valley.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.638
Which is why we had to
buy it all up.

10:45.711 --> 10:48.373
In your letter,
you offered Mr. Gaston $600

10:48.447 --> 10:49.937
for 200 acres of land.

10:50.016 --> 10:52.610
By my estimates, that's three
times what the land is worth.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.346
It's what we were
willing to pay.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.217
And Mr. Gaston
was the only holdout.

10:56.288 --> 10:57.619
He wouldn't sell?

10:57.690 --> 10:59.681
No.
He would not.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.387
Then it seems this company
would have very strong incentive

11:02.461 --> 11:03.860
to get rid of Mr. Gaston.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.123
By any means necessary.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.392
Are you suggesting
we had something to do

11:07.466 --> 11:08.592
with Gaston's demise?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.033
Somebody did.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.263
We're businessmen, Detective.
We deal in money, not blood.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.830
If a business venture
falls through,

11:15.908 --> 11:17.170
we move on to the next one.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.643
- So the project is dead?
- Not at all.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.943
We simply dam
above Gaston's property.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.676
There.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.252
"Strange Happenings
in Perth County.

11:35.327 --> 11:38.558
The luminous craft hovered over
the forest

11:38.631 --> 11:41.600
before shooting off to the east
at high speed. "

11:51.210 --> 11:52.939
What's my motto, Murdoch?

11:53.012 --> 11:55.572
You have several, sir.
All gems.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.775
No. No, no.
Those are aphorisms.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.751
I only have one motto,
and that's "Follow the money. "

12:00.820 --> 12:04.347
Who would stand to profit
from Henri Gaston's death?

12:04.423 --> 12:06.618
Ordinarily I would say
the Rouge Valley Lands,

12:06.692 --> 12:07.681
but apparently they plan

12:07.760 --> 12:09.489
to relocate their dam
further upriver.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.928
Mmh. So let's look at this
the other way.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.259
Who stood to lose?

12:13.332 --> 12:15.596
Well, by not selling,
Gaston did render

12:15.668 --> 12:17.898
one tract of land downriver
from him worthless.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.767
There's nothing like having
a sudden windfall

12:19.839 --> 12:22.171
snatched from your grasp to get
the blood pumping, is there?

12:22.241 --> 12:24.141
Find the owners
and check it out.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.974
Follow the money.
Hmm?

12:28.714 --> 12:30.682
Follow the money.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.987
Looking for something?

13:12.057 --> 13:14.252
Ah. Gentlemen.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.886
I'm Detective William Murdoch
of the Toronto Police.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.590
- Are you Jake and Kirk Maclsaac?
- That'd be us.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.327
I'm here to investigate
the death of Henri Gaston.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.232
Oh.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.328
That was some terrible news.

13:26.405 --> 13:29.101
Henri was a good man.
How can we help you?

13:29.175 --> 13:31.939
I understand you received
a rather generous offer

13:32.011 --> 13:34.343
from the Rouge Valley Land
Company to sell you property.

13:34.413 --> 13:35.505
That's right.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.277
I also understand
that Mr. Gaston's refusal

13:38.350 --> 13:40.477
to sell his property prevented
you from selling yours.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.953
- What are you getting at?
- You accusing us of something?

13:43.022 --> 13:45.490
Where were the both of you
the night before last?

13:45.558 --> 13:46.752
Asleep in our beds.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.124
Mmh.
Not much of an alibi, is it?

13:49.195 --> 13:51.129
Look, mister.
Henri was our friend.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.688
We wouldn't wish him harm, let
alone hang him from that tree.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.098
Gentlemen, do you honestly
expect me to believe

13:56.168 --> 13:57.795
that you have never
confronted Mr. Gaston

13:57.870 --> 13:59.394
on the sale of his land?

14:01.006 --> 14:03.406
You best go ahead.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.035
We did try to talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.544
It was like
he didn't even hear us.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.637
Instead, he kept going on

14:08.714 --> 14:11.239
about how there was something
happening in the corn field.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.012
Did he say what, exactly?

14:15.054 --> 14:17.784
He thought
someone was in the corn.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.825
Watching him.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.860
Going by Mr. Gaston's journal,

14:21.927 --> 14:23.952
he had something of an obsession
with this field.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.155
He had several entries about

14:25.231 --> 14:27.563
seeing lights over it
in the night.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.123
I'm more interested
in whether or not

14:29.201 --> 14:31.533
he mentioned who was after him.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.471
- Oh, he did.
- And?

14:34.540 --> 14:39.239
Well, sir, he believed he was
being watched by Martians.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.176
Martians, George?

14:42.181 --> 14:43.944
He felt they were among us.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.519
Clearly Gaston was more
delusional than I thought.

14:50.789 --> 14:51.721
Sir.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.553
You may want to come
take a look at this.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.423
What is it, George?

14:59.832 --> 15:02.892
It appears to be
a track of some sort.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.094
Sir, could this...

15:05.271 --> 15:07.171
Could this be
a Martian footprint?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.729
George,
don't let your imagination

15:08.807 --> 15:10.138
get the better of you.

15:10.209 --> 15:13.076
The tracks appear to be
going this way.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.078
Maybe we should call in
some other constables.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.639
That's not trepidation I hear,
is it?

15:18.717 --> 15:21.311
No, no, sir. Just we don't know
exactly what we're getting into.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.287
Well, it's not Martians.

15:23.355 --> 15:26.381
- How can you be sure?
- Occam's razor.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.188
- Occam's... Sorry, what?
- Occam's razor.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.956
It's a principle of logic
that states

15:31.030 --> 15:33.191
the simplest answer
is usually the correct one.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.732
Before we believe that Martians

15:34.800 --> 15:37.166
have flown millions of miles
through empty space

15:37.236 --> 15:38.567
to kill Henri Gaston,

15:38.637 --> 15:41.970
perhaps we should exhaust all
other earthbound alternatives.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.508
Uh...

15:43.575 --> 15:46.874
Tracks split here.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.937
You follow that set.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.348
Uh...

15:59.425 --> 16:01.359
George?

16:01.427 --> 16:03.292
You might want to come
have a look at this.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.227
Actually, sir...

16:06.231 --> 16:08.995
...I think you might want to
come take a look at this.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.470
Sir, I counted
five circles in all.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.778
Arrayed in a pentagonal form.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.011
How did you determine that?

16:27.086 --> 16:30.078
- I climbed a tree.
- Oh. Very good.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.988
Sir, Gaston's journal
had clippings in it

16:33.058 --> 16:35.424
dealing with
something like this.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.518
This?

16:36.595 --> 16:38.961
Yeah, circles.
In crop fields.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.898
Apparently it's happened in
England, Australia, now here.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.162
He seemed to think it was
something happening worldwide.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.534
Yes. It's called
Mother Nature, George.

16:46.605 --> 16:47.867
What?

16:48.907 --> 16:50.272
Localized wind shear.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.311
When two air masses
move in opposing directions,

16:53.379 --> 16:56.246
it causes the wind to spin,
like this.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.306
Like what... A small tornado
touched down here?

16:58.384 --> 16:59.316
Exactly.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.148
But, sir, the pattern
of the other circles...

17:01.220 --> 17:02.278
It's almost mathematical.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.151
You can climb the tree
if you'd like to see.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.681
George, a bee's honeycomb
is an array of hexagons.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.422
The turns of a snail's shell
follow a Fibonacci sequence.

17:10.496 --> 17:11.326
The what?

17:11.396 --> 17:13.991
Nature is full
of regular patterns

17:14.066 --> 17:17.035
that follow an underlying
mathematical sequence.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.627
Why should wind
be any different, George?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.036
Well, the footprints, then.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.097
Do you think the wind
created those?

17:23.175 --> 17:25.871
The footprints are a curiosity.
I'll grant you that.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.935
Make a plaster cast
of the best one you can find.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.743
- Yes, sir.
- And ask around with the locals.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.842
See if anyone's noticed
any other unusual goings-on.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.477
Sir.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.887
These things...
the circles, the footprints.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.447
You must think
they're connected.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.187
Possibly.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.491
But they don't answer
the central question...

17:44.563 --> 17:47.498
How did Henri Gaston
end up in that tree?

18:07.319 --> 18:10.254
And precisely when
did you hear these odd noises?

18:15.494 --> 18:16.654
Really?

18:16.728 --> 18:18.127
And these lights in the sky...

18:18.197 --> 18:19.926
What direction
were they coming from?

18:19.998 --> 18:23.024
- Just over there.
- Hmm. Toward the Rouge Valley.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.808
Where exactly
did you see this cow?

18:35.881 --> 18:38.372
In the field
in the back of Johnson's farm.

18:40.252 --> 18:43.653
What's this, then?
Another Sunday school project?

18:44.556 --> 18:46.353
It's a model of the crime scene.

18:46.425 --> 18:48.359
Ooh.
Some nice work.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.554
Please, sir.
It's quite delicate.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.096
"Precious" would be
a better word.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.597
Now, what's it supposed to mean?

18:53.665 --> 18:57.465
It demonstrates how the killers
got the body into that tree.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.163
So we're tracking two killers?

18:59.238 --> 19:03.140
Yes. The scheme I've devised
is a two-man operation.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.509
Um...

19:06.578 --> 19:08.443
A grappling hook
with a rope attached

19:08.514 --> 19:11.574
is fired from atop this tree
into this tree.

19:11.650 --> 19:16.553
The body is then sent down
the rope on a pulley.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.751
The first man
then follows behind

19:21.827 --> 19:25.126
and hoists the body

19:25.197 --> 19:27.961
into the upper portion
of the tree.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.466
All of this
is straightforward.

19:29.535 --> 19:30.627
You're bloody crackers!

19:30.702 --> 19:32.397
Why not just roll the body
into a ditch?

19:33.338 --> 19:36.239
I believe it's meant to confound
us for some unknown reason.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.536
Think you're wasting your time.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.975
I thought we agreed you were
going to follow the money.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.740
I am, sir,
but whoever killed him

19:41.813 --> 19:44.145
still had to hoist the body
up into the tree.

19:44.216 --> 19:48.152
And this is the only earthly
means that I could devise.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.551
Earthly?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.590
Constable Crabtree believes

19:53.659 --> 19:55.627
that Martians
might have been involved.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.857
Martians!
You're both bloody crackers!

19:58.931 --> 20:00.592
If it does turn out
to be a Martian,

20:00.666 --> 20:03.499
I want him handcuffed, booked,
and sitting in that cell.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.472
Them.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.507
Oh, right.
I forgot.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.339
It's a two-Martian operation.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.280
Julia?

20:28.427 --> 20:29.792
William.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.886
Good Lord.
Were we just on the same train?

20:31.964 --> 20:34.455
W- Where did you get on?

20:34.533 --> 20:36.797
- Union Station.
- Don Station.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.267
Oh, how funny.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.964
I came to see you
at your office, but...

20:40.038 --> 20:41.062
What are you doing here?

20:41.139 --> 20:43.198
I had an urgent telegram
from Constable Crabtree

20:43.275 --> 20:44.799
asking me to perform
a postmortem.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.844
There's been another homicide?

20:46.912 --> 20:49.039
Bovicide, actually.

20:49.114 --> 20:51.810
Now, you might think this is
just a typical dead cow.

20:51.883 --> 20:52.872
But upon a closer look

20:52.951 --> 20:55.749
you'll see that she appears
to have been hollowed out.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.652
Good Lord.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.953
You're right.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.186
It looks like someone
drilled a hole into her abdomen

21:02.261 --> 21:03.353
and emptied the contents.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.452
I should note, sir,

21:04.529 --> 21:06.793
that Mr. Gaston's journal
had a series of clippings

21:06.865 --> 21:08.230
dealing with incidents
like this...

21:08.300 --> 21:11.030
a rash of them in both
New Zealand and the Falklands.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.128
George, how does
this connect to our case?

21:14.773 --> 21:17.333
Sir, I think this is further
evidence of Martian activity.

21:17.409 --> 21:18.706
George, I know I asked you

21:18.777 --> 21:20.711
to be on the lookout
for anything unusual.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.974
But to drag Dr. Ogden
20 miles out of town

21:23.048 --> 21:24.310
to look at a dead cow...

21:24.383 --> 21:25.543
Actually, William...

21:26.551 --> 21:28.610
...I agree
with Constable Crabtree.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.485
Something has happened to this
cow that merits investigation.

21:31.556 --> 21:34.923
Yes, and I suspect you'll find
that it is a natural phenomenon.

21:34.993 --> 21:37.359
Cows get bloat
from eating wet crops.

21:37.429 --> 21:39.590
Gas pressure builds
within the animal

21:39.665 --> 21:41.963
and, unless released,
it can prove fatal.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.467
I'm familiar with bloat,
William.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.332
In severe cases,
the gases build up to the point

21:45.404 --> 21:47.668
where the animal literally
explodes, expelling the viscera.

21:47.739 --> 21:48.501
Exactly.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.541
Here someone has tried
to prevent that

21:50.609 --> 21:51.769
by lancing the cow's stomach.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.572
Thus the hole in the abdomen.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.239
It's a small hole for the kind
of evacuation you're describing.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.215
Sir, the dead cow's
not the half of it.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.183
People have been seeing lights
in the night sky.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.549
People have been hearing noises.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.350
There... There's still the issue
of the Martian feet.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.015
What in heaven's name is that?

22:06.091 --> 22:09.424
It's a rendering of a so-called
Martian footprint.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.486
Note the numerous bumps on the
surface of the bulbous toes.

22:12.564 --> 22:13.963
Now, it's my hypothesis, Doctor,

22:14.032 --> 22:15.966
that these bumps
are sensory organs

22:16.034 --> 22:18.867
designed to discern
the chemical content of the soil

22:18.937 --> 22:21.599
much as our noses discern
the chemical content of the air.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.608
Uh, well...

22:24.676 --> 22:26.644
It's an interesting theory,
Constable.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.077
Thank you.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.610
Wait.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.608
Scales.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.085
Yes, it's my belief that the
Martians are covered in scales.

22:36.154 --> 22:37.985
So while they might be
smarter than us,

22:38.056 --> 22:40.354
I have a feeling
they're a great deal uglier.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.299
Sir, where are you going?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.465
To arrest your Martians.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.075
Detective Murdoch.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.241
What can we do for you?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.410
This will only take a moment.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.615
Golfers, eh?

23:10.689 --> 23:13.487
A gift.
From our aunt in Scotland.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.923
Is that right?

23:14.993 --> 23:17.154
Constable, arrest these men.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.322
Let's go, gentlemen.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.397
- Chief Constable.
- Thomas.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.602
I'd like you to meet
Terrence Meyers.

23:32.677 --> 23:36.078
Mr. Meyers is the owner of
the Rouge Valley Lands Company.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.274
Inspector.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.907
Can I get you gentlemen
a spot of tea?

23:38.984 --> 23:40.417
No.

23:41.319 --> 23:42.251
Thank you.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.380
Well, we'll get to the point.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.721
I understand that
your Detective Murdoch

23:47.793 --> 23:49.351
is focusing his investigations

23:49.428 --> 23:52.192
on the land dealings
in the Rouge Valley.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.322
That's correct.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.662
Inspector, I stand to lose
a great deal

23:55.734 --> 23:58.294
if my name were to be associated
with any of this.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.804
- Do you?
- Thomas...

24:00.872 --> 24:03.568
Mr. Meyers is a very good friend
of the force.

24:03.642 --> 24:04.768
I see.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.242
Well, we'll do our best
to make sure

24:06.311 --> 24:08.245
that Mr. Meyers' name
stays out of the press.

24:08.313 --> 24:10.975
Well, we'll have to do
better than that.

24:11.049 --> 24:13.347
I'm not sure
there's more I can do.

24:14.419 --> 24:17.320
I give you my word
I'm not involved.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.586
Mr. Meyers, that alone isn't...

24:20.659 --> 24:24.993
Thomas.
Mr. Meyers gave you his word.

24:25.063 --> 24:27.293
I think that's enough.

24:27.365 --> 24:28.889
Don't you?

24:33.538 --> 24:35.768
The crop circles
would have been a snap.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.103
A central stake and a rope

24:37.175 --> 24:39.336
is all you would have needed
for that.

24:39.411 --> 24:42.778
But the footprints...
That's more difficult.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.645
But you're skilled men.

24:46.551 --> 24:49.384
A blacksmith's
dragon-scaling tool.

24:49.454 --> 24:50.887
For the scales.

24:58.663 --> 24:59.652
Golf balls.

24:59.731 --> 25:01.096
For the toes.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.762
Yours would have been
made of metal

25:03.835 --> 25:05.769
and likely fastened
to the bottom of a boot.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.805
Every blacksmith has a scaler.

25:07.873 --> 25:09.841
Anybody can get golf balls.

25:09.908 --> 25:13.571
But not every blacksmith
had motive.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.613
- You did.
- We're not murderers.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.240
You were trying to scare him
into selling his land

25:18.316 --> 25:20.682
by bringing his obsession
with Martians to life.

25:20.752 --> 25:23.243
But instead of running,
he dug his heels in,

25:23.321 --> 25:24.413
so you had to kill him.

25:24.489 --> 25:25.649
- No.
- No?

25:25.724 --> 25:27.351
Maybe it was an accident.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.517
Eh?

25:28.593 --> 25:30.151
You wrestled.
He fell awkwardly.

25:30.228 --> 25:31.923
- Broke his neck.
- That's not what happened.

25:31.997 --> 25:34.591
Then perhaps you were working at
the behest of Rouge Valley Lands

25:34.666 --> 25:36.258
as a couple of hired thugs.

25:36.334 --> 25:37.961
Murdoch.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.435
A word.

25:43.909 --> 25:48.141
If it was an accident,
you'll likely not get the noose.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.612
Something to think about.

25:54.185 --> 25:57.052
Sir, I was mid-interview.

25:57.122 --> 25:59.454
- Release them.
- Release them?

25:59.524 --> 26:01.685
I believe
they killed Henri Gaston.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.988
Based on what?

26:03.061 --> 26:04.426
The only hard evidence
you've got

26:04.496 --> 26:06.293
is a blacksmith's tool
and a few golf balls.

26:06.364 --> 26:08.298
Inspector, you told me
to follow the money.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.993
I believe this is where
that trail leads.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.330
And this is where it ends.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.268
We don't have
any evidence against them.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.465
Since when do you care
about that?

26:15.540 --> 26:17.838
You're pushing your luck,
Murdoch.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.275
- Sir?
- What?

26:20.345 --> 26:22.245
There's been
another murder, sir.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.511
How long has he been dead?

26:26.585 --> 26:27.677
Four to five hours.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.811
The Maclsaacs were in custody
at the time.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.822
So it appears that I was right,
after all.

26:31.890 --> 26:34.324
- Strange, though.
- What's that, sir?

26:34.392 --> 26:36.451
I feel I've seen him
someplace before,

26:36.528 --> 26:38.018
but I just can't think of where.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.257
And the cause of death?

26:40.332 --> 26:42.129
Well, there is this.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.792
I won't know
until I do my postmortem,

26:43.868 --> 26:47.201
but it would seem his viscera
have been evacuated.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.933
Just like the cow.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.772
And, sir, you should
take a look at this.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.846
- What's wrong?
- Walk down the line.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.785
Four train tickets
to Toronto, please.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.413
I've got rather
a large piece of luggage.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.390
Sir, what do you suppose
this all means?

27:07.459 --> 27:08.551
Perhaps it's a warning.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.117
Perhaps they know
we're onto them.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.719
Are they so superior

27:11.796 --> 27:13.855
that they think of us
as no different than cows?

27:13.932 --> 27:15.092
That is a scary thought.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.600
Doctor,
please don't encourage him.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.933
Right, then. Looks like
we're stuck here for the night.

27:20.005 --> 27:20.767
Stuck?

27:20.839 --> 27:22.466
Train lost a wheel
further down the track.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.201
They won't clear the line
till the morning.

27:24.275 --> 27:26.835
I'm afraid I'll need to perform
the postmortem right away.

27:26.911 --> 27:29.436
- We'll take a carriage, then.
- That would take much too long.

27:29.514 --> 27:32.483
Oh. Can you perform
the postmortem here?

27:33.385 --> 27:35.910
I'll need to purchase some
supplies, but otherwise yes.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.352
Oh, good.

27:37.422 --> 27:39.253
Then I suggest
we use this opportunity

27:39.324 --> 27:40.951
to find the identity
of the victim.

27:41.026 --> 27:43.153
And let's keep the gruesome
details to ourselves.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.321
There's no point
alarming the locals.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.627
And that means you, bugalugs.

27:48.533 --> 27:49.465
Hello.

27:49.534 --> 27:51.559
Could I have a bottle
of pure alcohol, please,

27:51.636 --> 27:53.103
and a bottle of distilled water.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.365
Oh, and a tarpaulin.

27:54.439 --> 27:55.804
And a bucket.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.570
I'm interested in learning
the identity of this man.

27:58.643 --> 28:02.739
He's a couple
of inches taller than myself.

28:02.814 --> 28:06.215
He wore an expensive suit.
Good shoes.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.113
So you can't be sure it's him?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.600
- He did look familiar to you?
- Yes, he does.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.296
In what way
did he look different?

28:26.371 --> 28:27.668
Hard to say.

28:33.812 --> 28:37.839
Very peculiar.
No one knew the victim.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.009
Yet everyone thought
they recognized him.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.279
Just like I did.

28:41.352 --> 28:43.377
But not as the man
in the picture.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.514
It's almost like
he didn't want to be noticed.

28:45.590 --> 28:46.750
Which worked.

28:46.825 --> 28:50.283
Here we are,
and we know nothing about him.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.922
As suspected,
the victim's internal organs

28:54.999 --> 28:56.296
have been completely removed.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.164
No stomach, no intestines.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.694
- Presumably the cause of death.
- It would seem so.

29:01.773 --> 29:04.640
Anything to indicate
how it was done?

29:04.709 --> 29:05.903
They seem to have been removed

29:05.977 --> 29:08.070
through this circular incision
made in his side

29:08.146 --> 29:09.704
measuring 11/4 inches.

29:09.781 --> 29:12.181
So they made a hole and then
pulled his guts out through it.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.445
The hole is too small
to accommodate a hand.

29:14.519 --> 29:17.647
Yes, well, they probably have
some sort of special tool.

29:17.722 --> 29:19.349
I didn't find anything
to suggest a tool,

29:19.424 --> 29:20.550
not even surgical.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.355
Perhaps a tube was inserted
into the incision

29:23.428 --> 29:25.293
and the contents drawn out
that way.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.352
By means of suction?

29:26.431 --> 29:28.262
Something along
the same principle

29:28.333 --> 29:30.665
as an electrical fan,
let's say.

29:30.735 --> 29:32.259
Only reversed.

29:32.337 --> 29:33.463
Well, there is one thing

29:33.538 --> 29:35.403
that should be of interest
to all of you.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.499
Try to imagine him
without the mustache.

29:39.577 --> 29:42.774
Oh, yes.
I recognize him now.

29:42.847 --> 29:46.044
- He was here a day or so ago.
- Oh, so you knew him, then?

29:46.117 --> 29:50.178
I did not know him at all.
But he seemed to know Henri.

29:50.255 --> 29:53.122
At least,
he knew things about him.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.751
What sort of things?

29:55.827 --> 29:59.627
He knew about Henri's telescope
and his charts too.

29:59.697 --> 30:01.164
Mmh.
What did he want?

30:01.232 --> 30:04.326
- To know where Henri's shop was.
- Did you tell him?

30:05.336 --> 30:07.201
- No.
- Why not?

30:07.272 --> 30:08.500
I didn't trust him.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.337
He spoke perfect English.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.398
Almost.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.739
Almost?

30:13.812 --> 30:16.747
He had the faintest
of Parisian accents.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.375
It seemed as if
he was trying to hide it.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.112
Did he happen to mention
where he was staying?

30:22.187 --> 30:24.712
He mentioned something
about a shack.

30:24.789 --> 30:26.848
But I don't know
if he was staying there.

30:32.363 --> 30:34.228
Sir.

30:34.299 --> 30:35.891
Take a look at this.

30:38.803 --> 30:41.567
- What do you make of that?
- A disguise kit.

30:41.639 --> 30:42.731
Look at these.

30:42.807 --> 30:45.275
Four travel documents
from different countries.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.436
One Belgian... Pierre Gagnon.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.673
One Algerian...
Francois Marchand.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.806
One British... Phillipe Tristan.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.681
One French... Claude Benoit.

30:54.752 --> 30:56.879
He's a confidence artist
who goes by Claude Benoit.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.522
That's where I know him from.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.322
He's the con man that's wanted
by the North West Mounted.

31:03.394 --> 31:07.023
He's unusually well-equipped
for a confidence trickster.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.623
Two men, both killed
in a very strange manner,

31:09.701 --> 31:12.101
who both happen to be French.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.468
Zut alors, mon ami.

31:17.442 --> 31:19.205
These are
the best accommodations in town.

31:19.277 --> 31:20.744
Well, if we're here
for the night,

31:20.812 --> 31:22.575
we might as well
make the most of it.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.808
- Uh, sir?
- Yes, George.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.479
I've been thinking
about what you said...

31:30.555 --> 31:32.648
the principle
of Occam's razor and all that.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.656
Yes?

31:33.725 --> 31:36.922
Well, with your grappling hooks
and ropes

31:36.995 --> 31:41.295
and suction devices
that we don't even know exist,

31:41.366 --> 31:44.335
aren't you avoiding
a much simpler explanation?

31:44.402 --> 31:46.700
There's no logical impediment

31:46.771 --> 31:49.001
to the existence of life
beyond our planet.

31:50.174 --> 31:51.698
George, the Bible says

31:51.776 --> 31:53.767
God created the Earth
and life and man.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.745
And there's no mention
of Martians.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.440
But the Bible isn't right
about everything.

31:57.515 --> 32:00.746
I mean, the Bible says that Cain
was banished to the wilderness.

32:00.818 --> 32:02.877
It also says that he ended up
with descendants.

32:02.954 --> 32:04.683
So who did he meet up with?

32:05.690 --> 32:07.555
George, I...

32:07.625 --> 32:10.185
I need some time alone
to think right now.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.489
All right?

32:11.562 --> 32:13.189
Yes, of course, sir.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.834
Oh.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.241
William.

32:28.513 --> 32:29.639
William?

32:30.815 --> 32:33.750
I'm sorry.
My mind was in the stars.

32:35.820 --> 32:38.618
Oh, I... I-I didn't...

32:38.690 --> 32:41.124
I thought that
I wasn't gonna see you.

32:41.192 --> 32:44.821
Your hair, it's... it's quite
lovely that way.

32:47.098 --> 32:50.693
Oh, well, would you like
to walk with me?

32:50.768 --> 32:52.702
I'd be delighted.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.106
- Inspector.
- Oh! Crabtree!

32:59.177 --> 33:00.872
What are you doing
skulking around?

33:00.945 --> 33:02.913
I couldn't sleep.
I saw you here.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.949
I wanted to run some ideas
past you.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.074
When I'm at home,

33:06.150 --> 33:08.914
the missus prefers
that I don't partake

33:08.987 --> 33:11.820
in this so-called filthy habit.

33:11.889 --> 33:14.016
Which is why, given the
odd chance such as tonight,

33:14.092 --> 33:17.721
I like to take a... a quiet walk
and enjoy a leisurely smoke.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.023
Do you mind?

33:20.465 --> 33:22.330
No.
Not at all, sir.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.129
Cigars don't bother me a bit.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.727
Now, perhaps Constable Crabtree
is correct.

33:26.804 --> 33:29.739
After all, Henri believed
in Martians... Now he's dead.

33:29.807 --> 33:31.832
The other fellow
who was connected to Henri...

33:31.909 --> 33:33.672
Now he too is dead.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.736
Just playing devil's advocate.

33:35.813 --> 33:37.644
I believe the cases
are connected somehow.

33:37.715 --> 33:39.683
But to accept
that Martians did this

33:39.751 --> 33:41.878
is to accept that, well,
Martians exist.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.250
Which you do not.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.152
It's a matter
of calculating the odds,

33:45.223 --> 33:47.282
starting with the likelihood
of intelligent life.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.122
Sir, do you think the Bible
never mentioned Martians

33:50.194 --> 33:52.822
because it simply
would have confused us?

33:52.897 --> 33:55.491
As far as I know,
God only made man in His image.

33:55.566 --> 33:57.932
- No mention of Martians at all.
- Hmm.

33:58.002 --> 34:00.266
That was Detective Murdoch's
point as well.

34:00.338 --> 34:01.532
Wonderful.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.471
Now I'm agreeing with Murdoch
on the Bible.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.806
Yes, but what if Martians have
been technologically advanced

34:06.878 --> 34:07.970
for thousands of years,

34:08.045 --> 34:09.946
and it's only now
that we're lighting our cities

34:10.014 --> 34:11.914
that they can see us?

34:11.983 --> 34:15.646
- Perhaps they see us a threat.
- A threat?

34:15.719 --> 34:18.313
I suppose God takes on
the essential human form...

34:18.389 --> 34:21.222
two arms, two legs, head, face.

34:21.292 --> 34:24.090
Okay, but then, what if Mars has
its own intelligent beings

34:24.161 --> 34:25.629
with two arms, two legs,
and so on?

34:25.696 --> 34:28.859
I mean, as far as that goes,
what if Mars has its own Bible,

34:28.933 --> 34:31.264
its own Martian Jesus?

34:32.703 --> 34:35.034
And Murdoch works with you
every single day?

34:35.106 --> 34:35.936
Hmm.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.268
Gets to work with me.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.437
Perhaps I'm just not
willing to accept

34:42.513 --> 34:44.639
that the most incredible event
in human history

34:44.715 --> 34:47.047
could happen in my time, to me.

34:47.118 --> 34:49.018
It's just too unlikely.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.284
Yes, but everything that happens
happens to somebody.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.255
Just think about
all the amazing things

34:54.324 --> 34:56.225
that have happened
in your lifetime already,

34:56.293 --> 34:59.024
all the things
that are going to happen.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.498
Do you hear something, William?

35:15.513 --> 35:16.912
Do you hear that noise?

35:16.981 --> 35:19.575
Sounds like an engine
of some sort.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.880
Oh, bloody hell.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.524
We have to follow it, sir.
We can't let it get away!

35:36.601 --> 35:38.694
Bloody hell. What do you think
you're gonna do if we catch it?

35:38.769 --> 35:40.327
I don't know.
I'll figure it out when I do.

35:41.572 --> 35:43.005
- It's gone.
- What?

35:43.074 --> 35:44.735
Nonsense.
It can't just vanish.

35:45.943 --> 35:48.036
No, it's still
out there somewhere.

35:48.112 --> 35:50.512
And I think I know
how we can find it.

35:53.017 --> 35:54.382
So, what's your theory, then?

35:54.452 --> 35:56.511
Gaston's observations.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.782
The lights in the sky,
the sounds.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.414
I believe I know
what he was describing.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.118
The Martian flying machine.

36:02.193 --> 36:03.592
No, not Martians,

36:03.661 --> 36:05.424
but a flying airship
of some sort.

36:05.496 --> 36:06.588
A- A dirigible.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.894
A motorized one.
That's fantastic.

36:08.966 --> 36:12.367
I believe Gaston was plotting
the sightings on this map.

36:12.436 --> 36:14.165
Well, let's see.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.534
Sightings.

36:17.608 --> 36:22.545
June 18th.
North 43.85 degrees.

36:22.613 --> 36:25.343
West 079. 14.

36:25.416 --> 36:26.849
- Yes.
- Here.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.478
Why would an airship
be in the Rouge Valley?

36:29.554 --> 36:32.250
I don't know, but it does
provide a rational explanation

36:32.323 --> 36:33.813
for how Gaston
got into that tree.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.951
Perhaps he was in the airship
and fell out as it passed over.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.155
And the question is,
did he jump or was he pushed?

36:39.230 --> 36:42.131
Yes.
And the last one... July 3rd.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.963
North 43.9.

36:44.035 --> 36:48.563
West 079.3.

36:48.639 --> 36:51.233
All the sightings seem to
radiate from one central point.

36:51.309 --> 36:53.106
Yes.
Concession 51.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.611
What about the second victim?
Where does he fit in to this?

36:55.680 --> 36:56.908
That's unclear at the moment.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.973
But I do believe it has to do
with this land sale.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.484
Be more specific.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.884
The Maclsaacs preyed
on Gaston's fears.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.013
So too does this airship.

37:05.089 --> 37:06.716
It's all too much
of a coincidence.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.224
But the Maclsaacs
were in custody

37:08.292 --> 37:10.453
when the second victim
was killed.

37:10.528 --> 37:11.859
There's another party involved.

37:11.929 --> 37:14.090
- The Rouge Valley Land Company.
- Most likely.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.292
What would a land company
be doing with an airship?

37:16.367 --> 37:17.595
Good question, Crabtree.

37:17.668 --> 37:19.693
Right, then, I'll take
a carriage back to Toronto

37:19.770 --> 37:21.601
and check on
the Rouge Valley Land Company.

37:21.672 --> 37:23.902
You two find this airship.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.409
Airship and a land company.

37:35.052 --> 37:37.953
I think this is it, George.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.991
We'll carry on by foot
from here.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.390
Whoa.

38:04.882 --> 38:07.612
Someone's playing silly buggers
with me.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.175
You weren't the only one.

38:09.253 --> 38:11.380
Chief Constable.
What are you doing here?

38:11.455 --> 38:14.049
Thomas, we need to have
a wee chat.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.219
- About how I was duped?
- How we both were.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.728
So, what do we do about it?

38:18.796 --> 38:20.821
Nothing.
Our hands are tied.

38:20.898 --> 38:22.263
What do you mean?

38:22.333 --> 38:23.766
No one ties
my bloody hands, sir.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.927
Thomas!

38:26.003 --> 38:29.871
As I said,
we need to have a wee chat.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.303
I hear a voice.

38:37.448 --> 38:39.006
I can't make out
what they're saying.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.345
I don't think it's English, sir.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.886
Perhaps it's Martian.

38:42.953 --> 38:46.445
- Eastern European, I think.
- It's Russian, to be exact.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.991
Professor, it is imperative that
we leave as soon as possible.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.526
Our operation here
is compromised.

39:23.594 --> 39:24.686
If we attempt to leave

39:24.762 --> 39:27.026
without rectifying
the cooling problem,

39:27.098 --> 39:29.760
we'll have to
abort our mission again!

39:37.341 --> 39:40.833
Detective Murdoch.
What a shame to see you here.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.776
Although I'm not surprised.

39:42.847 --> 39:45.077
You do seem to be
the persistent sort.

39:45.149 --> 39:46.776
So you two are in on this?

39:46.851 --> 39:48.876
Only you're not Jake
and Kirk Maclsaac, are you?

39:48.953 --> 39:51.217
Colonel Thadeus Wainwright.
U.S. Cavalry.

39:51.288 --> 39:53.654
Commander Reginald Sharp.
Royal Navy.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.557
Military.
What are you doing here?

39:56.627 --> 39:59.289
Gentlemen.
If you'll please come this way.

40:07.438 --> 40:09.099
Sir.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.340
Detective Murdoch.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.345
Mr. Meyers.
If that really is your name.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.780
- It will do.
- What's going on here?

40:18.849 --> 40:20.214
What's going on here, Detective,

40:20.284 --> 40:22.650
is nothing less than
the reinvention of warfare.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.451
Like Rozier's hot-air balloons,
but with more control.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.492
Ah.
A student of war?

40:28.559 --> 40:29.890
I have some knowledge
on the subject.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.222
Then you will understand

40:31.295 --> 40:33.559
the importance
of controlling the skies.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.963
The secret is the engine,
isn't it?

40:36.033 --> 40:39.901
Engine... the power of 80 horses
but the size of a pig.

40:39.970 --> 40:42.029
Thanks to
Professor Skrzhinsky here

40:42.106 --> 40:44.574
we can go as high as we want
and as far as we want.

40:44.642 --> 40:46.473
We can spy on our enemies.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.603
And rain destruction on them
from above.

40:48.679 --> 40:49.771
Perhaps.

40:49.847 --> 40:52.441
So now you understand
the importance of secrecy.

40:52.516 --> 40:54.143
Is that what happened
to Henri Gaston...

40:54.218 --> 40:56.049
He stuck his nose
where it didn't belong?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.849
What happened to Mr. Gaston
was a tragic case

40:57.922 --> 40:59.082
of mistaken identity.

40:59.156 --> 41:01.021
The British War Office
received information

41:01.091 --> 41:02.683
about a French operative
in the area,

41:02.760 --> 41:04.022
most likely to steal our design.

41:04.094 --> 41:06.528
Henri followed the airship here
and was captured.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.394
Because he spoke
with a French accent,

41:08.466 --> 41:10.161
our men assumed
he was the operative.

41:10.234 --> 41:12.498
How did he end up dead
in the tree?

41:12.570 --> 41:13.969
Henri believed that our men

41:14.038 --> 41:16.199
were acting in league
with the Martians,

41:16.273 --> 41:17.638
so he refused to talk to them.

41:17.708 --> 41:20.074
They took him in the airship
hoping to loosen his tongue.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.771
By frightening him.
Nothing more.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.074
But instead he panicked.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.275
Before anyone could move,
he jumped.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.784
And his scarf snagged
in the tree.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.245
If only he had
simply taken our offer.

41:34.391 --> 41:35.551
Yes, if only.

41:35.626 --> 41:38.186
And what about the other victim?
Mr. Benoit?

41:38.262 --> 41:39.854
He was the real
French operative.

41:39.930 --> 41:41.090
Yeah.

41:41.165 --> 41:44.032
How did you suck his guts out?

41:44.101 --> 41:47.093
That was my idea, actually.
See that machine behind you?

41:47.171 --> 41:49.571
We use it to rapidly deflate
the dirigible.

41:49.640 --> 41:53.906
It didn't take much adjustment
to use it for... something else.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.969
Anyway, I think we've answered

41:56.046 --> 41:57.274
more than enough
of your questions.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.213
How will you keep us
from talking?

41:59.283 --> 42:02.343
Are we about to become the next
victims of Martian attack?

42:02.419 --> 42:04.785
Yes.
Yes, you are.

42:19.803 --> 42:22.601
Elmer! Stop that!

42:22.673 --> 42:24.937
I don't want you getting
too close!

42:25.009 --> 42:27.000
What's gonna happen?

42:27.077 --> 42:29.637
I don't know.

42:29.713 --> 42:33.581
But there's just something
devilish about them.

42:37.354 --> 42:38.753
Oh.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.847
Oh, my head.

42:40.925 --> 42:44.417
Well. Perhaps if you weren't
such a drinker.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.361
Yes, of course, ma'am.

42:51.101 --> 42:52.966
- George.
- Sir!

42:59.977 --> 43:01.069
Are you okay?

43:01.145 --> 43:03.238
Fine, fine.
You?

43:03.314 --> 43:05.282
Good.

43:05.349 --> 43:06.680
I'm good.

43:14.692 --> 43:16.853
Ma'am. Sir.

43:27.338 --> 43:28.635
No.

43:28.706 --> 43:31.140
It was... It was here!
It was huge!

43:31.208 --> 43:32.835
Sir, there were
a dozen or more men.

43:32.910 --> 43:35.538
Torches, equipment.
It was a massive setup.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.138
We can't waste any time. We have
to start gathering evidence.

43:38.215 --> 43:40.206
Murdoch, it's over.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.216
What?

43:41.285 --> 43:42.718
This letter
was hand-delivered to me

43:42.786 --> 43:44.686
direct from
the prime minister's office,

43:44.755 --> 43:47.883
requesting that we desist
with any further investigation.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.448
But, sir,
two men have been killed.

43:49.526 --> 43:52.518
If we do persist,
we'll be charged with treason.

43:52.596 --> 43:54.154
Treason, sir.
That's the noose.

43:54.231 --> 43:55.357
Exactly their point.

43:55.432 --> 43:58.663
- Sir, we can't just give up.
- We have no choice, Murdoch.

43:58.736 --> 44:01.261
This is outrageous that
our government would do this.

44:01.338 --> 44:04.171
Using a... well,
an unidentified flying object

44:04.241 --> 44:06.402
to cover
their own nefarious activities.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.671
It's conspiratorial.

44:07.745 --> 44:09.042
Listen, this is the government.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.206
This operation
involved national security.

44:11.281 --> 44:12.748
Security, yes.
But at what cost?

44:12.816 --> 44:15.842
Yes. Henri Gaston didn't ask
to be involved in this.

44:15.919 --> 44:17.443
His death
was an unfortunate accident.

44:17.521 --> 44:18.852
We should
ignore their behavior

44:18.922 --> 44:20.219
because it's our government?

44:20.290 --> 44:22.281
I'm not saying that
it's right or that it's ideal,

44:22.359 --> 44:23.690
but we do have a duty
to the Crown.

44:23.761 --> 44:25.092
- Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.995
These people...
They'll do this again.

44:28.065 --> 44:30.693
We'll just have to
keep an eye out for them.

44:30.768 --> 44:33.328
Good luck, Murdoch. But you
can't take on the government.

44:35.706 --> 44:39.904
You know, if I was gonna do
something like this,

44:39.977 --> 44:43.469
I would set up shop out in the
middle of the desert somewhere.

44:43.547 --> 44:45.310
Yes, like California.

44:45.382 --> 44:46.371
Exactly.

44:46.450 --> 44:48.611
The territory of
New Mexico... That'd be my pick.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.711
Oh, yes, William.
That's a splendid choice.

44:50.788 --> 44:53.222
Ah, you're
all crackers... Wales!

44:53.290 --> 44:55.986
Now, no one in their right mind
would go there.
