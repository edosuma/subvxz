00:05.621 --> 00:06.970
<i>Out here
in the middle,</i>

00:07.100 --> 00:08.660
<i>people are straight shooters.</i>

00:08.695 --> 00:10.345
<i>They just say it
like it is.</i>

00:14.580 --> 00:17.526
<i>Well, I got one of those types
in my house as well.</i>

00:17.610 --> 00:19.070
Hell, yeah,
you were a mistake.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.450
I mean, we're happy
that you're here now,

00:20.570 --> 00:22.008
but you were
definitely a mistake.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.520
It's funny,
'cause you're not fat,

00:23.660 --> 00:25.990
but that skirt
sure makes you look fat.

00:26.140 --> 00:28.214
Who told you
Scrappy went to a farm?

00:28.410 --> 00:30.052
He's not on a farm.
He's dead.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.551
Oh, hey, Dad,

00:33.680 --> 00:35.410
I'm trying out
for swim team.

00:35.430 --> 00:37.609
Do you want to come watch me
swim laps at the pool?

00:37.660 --> 00:39.060
- Sounds boring.
- Mike.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.400
- It does.
- Mike.

00:40.530 --> 00:43.646
You saying my name over and over
doesn't make it sound less boring.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.360
<i>But sometimes the family
needs more than honesty.</i>

00:46.490 --> 00:49.461
<i>It needs a cheerleader,
and that's me.</i>

00:49.820 --> 00:52.144
You know, Sue, I think
what your dad is saying

00:52.179 --> 00:53.930
is it sounds like
a lot of fun.

00:55.584 --> 00:58.334
The dryer's making
that noise again.

00:58.650 --> 01:00.011
<i>Noise again.</i>

01:00.380 --> 01:02.860
What noise?
Your dad fixed it.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.468
It's working great now.

01:06.350 --> 01:08.779
Damn thing's
on its last legs.

01:08.810 --> 01:09.749
I can't hear the TV.

01:10.140 --> 01:13.018
No, we can't afford a new
dryer right now. It's fine.

01:13.890 --> 01:15.267
Did anybody get the mail?

01:15.380 --> 01:16.610
Get more pop.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.986
Axl, come on.
Let's go.

01:19.140 --> 01:20.950
<i>Axl had told us
he was at church group</i>

01:20.985 --> 01:22.661
<i>when he was actually
sticking his tongue</i>

01:22.733 --> 01:24.345
<i>down some girl's throat
at the mall.</i>

01:24.620 --> 01:27.479
<i>So he'd earned himself one of
Mike's famous punishments--</i>

01:27.590 --> 01:28.565
<i>For the next two weeks,</i>

01:28.600 --> 01:31.605
<i>he had to stay within 5 feet
of a parent at all times.</i>

01:38.250 --> 01:40.661
Oh, my God, Mike.
It's 2009.

01:40.790 --> 01:42.100
What?! Already?

01:42.240 --> 01:44.078
Yeah, Mike. 2009.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.752
How did this happen?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.203
No payments till 2009.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.425
No payments till 2009.

01:54.010 --> 01:56.230
No payments till 2009.

01:56.390 --> 01:58.964
The economy's gonna be
great by then.

01:59.550 --> 02:00.990
Great.
Now with interest,

02:01.025 --> 02:03.192
we owe $650 on a VCR

02:03.242 --> 02:05.587
we sold at the garage sale
last year for 2 bucks.

02:07.950 --> 02:09.031
You know what?

02:09.440 --> 02:10.298
It'll be fine.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.680
It's fine.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.738
It'll be fine.
We're fine.

02:13.970 --> 02:16.700
These things have a way
of working themselves out.

02:16.735 --> 02:19.484
As long as the dryer hangs on
and I sell a car this month,

02:19.740 --> 02:21.300
we're gonna be fine.

<i>Fortunately, out here, you always
have neighbors you can count on...</i>

02:37.150 --> 02:41.080
Hi. Would it be okay if I
just threw in a quick dry?

02:42.930 --> 02:46.115
Hi. Hate to bother.
Just one more quick load?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.220
And when that fails...

02:48.270 --> 02:52.475
Hello? Hello? I'm hurt,
and my mom and dad aren't home.

02:55.420 --> 02:58.096
I'll just do this quick load
while you try to find them.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.062
You won't even know
I'm here.

03:01.850 --> 03:04.537
<i>So the busted dryer piled
on to the whole 2009 thing</i>

03:04.572 --> 03:06.553
<i>meant we were gonna have
to cut corners fast.</i>

03:06.750 --> 03:08.820
<i>First up,
a trip to the Frugal Hoosier,</i>

03:08.920 --> 03:11.300
<i>Indiana's number one
expired food store.</i>

03:14.940 --> 03:16.680
So are we, like,
poor now?

03:16.810 --> 03:18.420
No, we're not poor.
We're just thrifty.

03:18.550 --> 03:21.031
We're trying something new
called living within our means.

03:21.066 --> 03:22.523
You mean we've been
living outside our means?

03:23.030 --> 03:24.120
Oh, God.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.800
You should be thanking me.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.437
Listen, smart consumers--
They're the kids who are popular.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.000
Brick, shake some
of those unmarked cans

03:32.140 --> 03:33.780
and see if you can find peas.
Okay?

03:33.930 --> 03:35.566
We're listening for peas,
people.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.730
Hi, Bob.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.500
Frankie, hi.
It's me, Bob.

03:38.630 --> 03:40.550
Listen, Ehlert is
throwing a major hissy.

03:40.650 --> 03:43.015
He's calling everybody in for
some emergency meeting at 1:00.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.580
1:00? Are you kidding me?
I was barely making it at 3:00.

03:45.615 --> 03:46.520
Unh-unh. No fish.

03:46.650 --> 03:47.421
<i>You've gotta
get in here.</i>

03:47.473 --> 03:48.450
I don't know
what it's about,

03:48.560 --> 03:49.980
and I'm--I'm just
freaking out here.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.587
Okay, I'll call Mike
at the quarry

03:51.637 --> 03:52.670
and figure something out
with the kids.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.103
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just breathe.

03:55.570 --> 03:57.970
Okay, kids, new plan.
Gotta get to work early.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.276
But what about the pool?

03:59.390 --> 04:01.905
You promised you'd watch me
practice for swim tryouts.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.054
And you said you would
take me to the library.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.354
"The Wheel of Nuldoid"--

04:05.404 --> 04:07.580
I have to check it out
before anybody else gets it.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.171
You promised.

04:09.353 --> 04:10.610
<i>Promised.</i>

04:10.750 --> 04:13.767
Okay, I know I didn't promise that
many things. I'm not that nice.

04:14.070 --> 04:15.880
Listen, we'll swing
by the library,

04:15.990 --> 04:17.420
and then when your father
gets home from work,

04:17.540 --> 04:18.730
he'll take you
to the pool.

04:18.765 --> 04:21.067
But if you kids ever want
to eat name brand food again,

04:21.101 --> 04:21.954
I have to get to work.

04:22.024 --> 04:23.090
Come on.
Let's move it.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.010
I love this book.
I love this book. I love this book.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.060
I hate my life.
I hate my life. I ha--

04:28.190 --> 04:30.489
You got 5 feet, mister.
Use all of it.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.700
Uh-oh. You have a fine.

04:34.210 --> 04:36.199
Oh, that's no problem.
How much?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.052
We're in kind of a hurry.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.089
$189.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.585
You're kidding.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.924
I'm sorry,
but there is no way

04:42.959 --> 04:44.490
that we can pay
that fine right now.

04:44.620 --> 04:46.210
I mean,
our dryer just broke,

04:46.330 --> 04:48.982
and I haven't sold a car,
and it's 2009.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.274
Right.
Next in line.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.890
Mom, don't they know
who you are?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.896
Flash her
your Frugal Hoosier card.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.081
Listen, my son
is a very odd kid.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.840
Books
are everything to him.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.448
He has no friends.

05:05.310 --> 05:07.581
I'm sorry,
but until you pay the fine,

05:07.616 --> 05:08.479
you're banned.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.804
Oh... and your library
card has been flagged.

05:12.590 --> 05:14.068
Have a nice day.

05:16.510 --> 05:17.366
You know what?

05:17.470 --> 05:18.660
This is a good thing.

05:18.695 --> 05:21.088
Your teacher says you need
more social interaction.

05:21.090 --> 05:23.140
And besides,
you're not watching enough TV.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.435
You don't want
to be the only kid

05:24.495 --> 05:26.162
who doesn't know
who won "The Bachelor."

05:26.330 --> 05:28.498
<i>Yep, there I was,
still cheerleading,</i>

05:28.620 --> 05:32.080
<i>from a hole getting so deep
I could barely see the sky.</i>

05:32.650 --> 05:33.790
Hey, did
you cover for me?

05:33.930 --> 05:35.490
I told them that you had a
pregnancy scare on the way in

05:35.620 --> 05:37.254
and also that
you burst an aneurysm.

05:37.626 --> 05:40.185
You should know that I do
not think he bought it.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.132
Curler.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.860
But trailing even the most pathetic
of you is our newest employee,

05:47.010 --> 05:48.117
Frances Heck.

05:48.450 --> 05:51.320
Her sales record
is minus one.

05:51.770 --> 05:54.042
<i>Negative uno vehiculo--</i>

05:54.250 --> 05:56.410
That's mexican for
"not good."

05:56.550 --> 05:58.472
Well, you know,
there is recession on.

05:58.610 --> 06:00.670
Enough of
your Communist whining.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.590
It's always somebody else's fault--

06:02.740 --> 06:06.020
the economy,
your mama didn't breast-feed you,

06:06.150 --> 06:08.710
the government won't let you
marry a houseplant.

06:08.890 --> 06:12.840
Now I want to hear some
suggestions to perk up business.

06:12.980 --> 06:15.380
And don't anybody
say free mugs.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.922
Well, I'll throw
your stragglers a bone.

06:19.150 --> 06:21.388
How about a free AK-47
with every sale?

06:21.520 --> 06:22.553
People love guns.

06:23.270 --> 06:25.493
You really want
to arm our customers?

06:26.850 --> 06:27.962
Anybody else?

06:28.020 --> 06:29.834
Oh! Here's a thought--

06:30.300 --> 06:31.830
I was just in
the Frugal Hoosier,

06:31.970 --> 06:34.212
and they have these Ronald Reagan
inaugural jelly beans--

06:34.247 --> 06:35.340
50 cents a bag.

06:35.490 --> 06:36.628
How about we fill
a car with them

06:36.678 --> 06:38.325
and let people guess
how many for a prize?

06:38.620 --> 06:40.080
I don't know.
Thought it'd be fun.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.641
Hmm. Clever...

06:44.660 --> 06:45.624
Patriotic...

06:46.220 --> 06:46.950
Cheap.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.947
You know, I was gonna fire you
right after the meeting,

06:51.310 --> 06:55.438
but I think I'll just move
that Post-It to next week.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.973
Hear that, Pete?

07:00.034 --> 07:02.322
Not fired for another week.
Yeah, baby.

07:04.130 --> 07:07.660
<i>So while I was busy hanging on
to my job by my fingernails...</i>

07:07.810 --> 07:08.540
Yeah, so good.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.400
Cannonball!

07:09.530 --> 07:11.750
<i>At least I knew
my family was having fun</i>

07:11.785 --> 07:13.153
<i>at the Orson Aquatorium.</i>

07:13.260 --> 07:14.251
Axl, you getting in?

07:14.270 --> 07:15.308
Pool's queer.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.220
Brick, how about you?
You getting in?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.113
Swimming's no fun
without a book.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.291
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.103
Come on, Brick.
Look at those boys.

07:24.205 --> 07:25.021
They're having fun.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.720
Mom says
I'm supposed to interact.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.596
So can I tell you
the plot of the book

07:32.631 --> 07:34.211
I wasn't allowed
to check out?

07:34.390 --> 07:36.911
Chapter one:
"Grampa's Story."

07:37.060 --> 07:39.200
"Grampa Worst
was old and dying--"

07:39.330 --> 07:40.181
Oh! Oh, daddy!

07:40.213 --> 07:41.660
I'm ready for you
to watch me swim now.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.043
Hey, finally.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.445
At least one of my kids is
actually getting in the pool.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.640
"He was dying of something
old people die of."

07:47.780 --> 07:48.643
So you got it.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.755
All right, Sue! Come on, kid.
Show us how it's done.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.226
Hi, guys!

08:12.600 --> 08:13.780
Did you have fun
at the pool?

08:13.940 --> 08:16.307
Dad said that
I suck at swimming

08:16.437 --> 08:20.013
and I shouldn't try out
for swim team.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.531
Then I bought you
a creamsicle.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.480
So then the Nuldoids
kidnap this kid

08:28.620 --> 08:30.724
and take him
to the bowels of the Earth.

08:30.759 --> 08:32.309
Speaking of bowels,
what's for dinner?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.618
Hey, no complaints.

08:33.619 --> 08:35.809
That chicken or beef stew
last night was great,

08:35.840 --> 08:37.270
and we all kept
that down.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.880
<i>Not completely true.</i>

08:39.010 --> 08:40.730
And after
the giant tunnel hole,

08:40.850 --> 08:43.940
they go to the ancient slide
of the Droiden Frobble dynasty.

08:44.070 --> 08:46.880
Okay, Brick, honey,
great social interaction today.

08:47.010 --> 08:48.320
Now please go find a book.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.497
There must be one book in
the house you haven't read.

08:50.860 --> 08:51.722
Okay.

08:52.960 --> 08:53.775
Hey, champ.

08:54.740 --> 08:57.163
Mom says I've had enough
social interaction today.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.511
Okay. Catch you later.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.360
<i>I was still mad at Mike,</i>

09:01.510 --> 09:03.438
<i>but I have
a pretty good poker face.</i>

09:04.670 --> 09:06.055
Frankie, you weren't there.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.464
You weren't at the pool.
She was bad. She was...

09:09.320 --> 09:11.488
rhythmic dance team
tryout bad.

09:12.270 --> 09:14.530
All right, well,
just because she sucks

09:14.660 --> 09:16.430
doesn't mean you should
tell her that she sucks.

09:16.465 --> 09:18.217
What do you think that
does for her self-esteem?

09:18.252 --> 09:20.030
You know, I thought I was
taking 'em to the pool.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.205
If I had known it was gonna be
anything about self-esteem,

09:22.240 --> 09:23.228
I wouldn't have done it.

09:24.810 --> 09:25.730
What do you want?

09:25.850 --> 09:26.686
5 feet, Dad.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.765
What should I have
done, Frankie--

09:33.800 --> 09:34.416
Lie to her?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.816
Since when did telling
the truth become a bad thing?

09:36.930 --> 09:40.200
Sue's a sensitive young girl
who needs to be treated delicately.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.470
Her emotions
are right on the surface.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.934
She's not Axl.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.010
We're her parents, Mike.

09:49.150 --> 09:52.023
It's our job to cheer her on,
no matter what.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.320
Hey, I love my daughter,

09:53.450 --> 09:54.780
and I'm not gonna
have her made fun of.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.238
If someone's gonna
dash her hopes,

09:56.273 --> 09:57.601
damn it,
it should be her family.

09:58.570 --> 10:00.641
Mom, Dad,
guess what?

10:01.180 --> 10:03.390
They did an eye test
today at school,

10:03.520 --> 10:05.087
and I need glasses.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.450
<i>In retrospect,
I guess there were signs.</i>

10:09.880 --> 10:12.786
Oh, I only want one.
I don't need both of them,

10:12.950 --> 10:13.714
but thanks.

10:13.810 --> 10:14.544
I got it!

10:15.930 --> 10:17.411
Isn't it exciting?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.369
I've always wanted glasses!

10:21.560 --> 10:23.800
Mike, don't you see
what this means?

10:23.940 --> 10:25.588
That we're never getting
a new dryer?

10:26.200 --> 10:30.340
No, this explains why Sue never
makes anything. She's blind.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.837
Oh, Mike.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.240
See, you never know what's
gonna happen in life.

10:34.370 --> 10:36.756
That's why you don't
dash someone's dreams.

10:36.890 --> 10:38.440
Right.
That's why you c--Hey!

10:39.510 --> 10:40.563
Mom?

10:41.204 --> 10:43.443
Which part of me is
my hungering manhood?

10:45.410 --> 10:47.920
<i>If the library fines
were half a dryer...</i>

10:48.070 --> 10:49.783
<i>Glasses were
a whole dryer...</i>

10:49.940 --> 10:52.967
<i>But luckily, the Frugal Hoosier
has an optical department</i>

10:53.550 --> 10:54.884
<i>and no mirrors.</i>

10:56.190 --> 10:56.941
Dork.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.421
Dork.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.127
I would never stop
punching you.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.535
Knock it off.

11:06.050 --> 11:09.190
She's a young girl with
emotions all over her surface

11:09.340 --> 11:10.520
or something like that.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.706
Anyway, our job is
to cheer her on.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.310
Oh, my God.
Those look so great.

11:16.460 --> 11:19.310
Seriously. I think you should
really, really buy them.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.798
Okay.
Guess these are the ones.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.117
There is no stopping me
on swim team now.

11:25.490 --> 11:27.020
Y-you're still trying out?

11:27.160 --> 11:29.810
Yeah. Mom told me
you said I shouldn't try out,

11:29.910 --> 11:32.085
'cause you wanted to test
how much I really wanted it.

11:32.310 --> 11:34.039
Well, I want it, Dad,

11:34.270 --> 11:35.584
now more than ever.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.123
Well, if that's
what your mom said,

11:37.158 --> 11:38.950
then I'm sure
that's what I meant.

11:41.630 --> 11:42.760
All right, that's it.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.988
It's all that'll fit.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.430
Oh, doesn't this look great?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.764
I think this is
really gonna be...

11:48.890 --> 11:49.770
<i>Frankie,</i>

11:49.930 --> 11:51.900
<i>your husband is
on line one.</i>

11:52.050 --> 11:53.268
<i>He wants
to take a shower</i>

11:53.329 --> 11:56.820
<i>and needs you on the line
with Axl till he's out.</i>

11:57.030 --> 11:59.380
Hey, that is
his punishment!

11:59.500 --> 12:01.325
<i>Tell him to make Axl
put on a bathing suit</i>

12:01.360 --> 12:03.130
<i>and get
in there with him.</i>

12:05.740 --> 12:07.110
So how's it going out here?

12:07.420 --> 12:09.520
Oh. Uh, Mr. Ehlert, sir.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.600
Hard at work.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.961
It may look like fun,
but it's--it's work, work, work.

12:13.970 --> 12:15.442
You did good, Frances.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.330
Since this was your idea,

12:17.470 --> 12:20.283
my commission on the first sale
of the day goes to you.

12:20.410 --> 12:21.620
You're kidding.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.210
Oh, Mr. Ehlert, you don't know
how much this means to me.

12:24.350 --> 12:26.880
My daughter Sue needs glasses
and our dryer--

12:27.000 --> 12:28.502
Already stopped listening.

12:28.870 --> 12:31.285
So, uh, how many
jelly beans are in there?

12:34.840 --> 12:38.390
<i>Okay, so we forgot the little detail
of counting the jelly beans.</i>

12:38.530 --> 12:40.110
<i>I wasn't gonna let
that set us back.</i>

12:40.240 --> 12:41.510
<i>There's a solution
for everything.</i>

12:41.640 --> 12:45.390
425,362 jelly beans.

12:45.550 --> 12:46.470
Wow.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.695
<i>Isn't he smart?
He is so smart.</i>

12:49.930 --> 12:52.027
<i>Damn it,
he deserves a book.</i>

12:52.500 --> 12:54.770
<i>I may not be able
to afford a new dryer.</i>

12:54.890 --> 12:57.539
<i>But I could figure out
a way to get my kid his book.</i>

12:58.020 --> 12:59.910
<i>Plus, I had to keep him
out of my bookshelf.</i>

13:00.050 --> 13:03.020
And then when the Rakish
count stormed into the room,

13:03.150 --> 13:04.625
her bosom heaved.

13:04.770 --> 13:06.119
That means she threw up.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.400
Kid!

13:10.710 --> 13:13.250
Yeah. Come here.

13:15.010 --> 13:15.983
How'd you like
to check out

13:16.034 --> 13:17.876
this book for me
on your card, huh?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.170
No, no.
You don't have to tell anybody.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.963
It'll just be
our little secret.

13:22.150 --> 13:23.190
I don't know.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.353
Oh, come on.
What's gonna happen?

13:25.415 --> 13:27.330
Nothing.
I promise.

13:28.530 --> 13:30.544
I have jelly beans.

13:31.190 --> 13:32.201
Okay.

13:32.450 --> 13:34.257
Great. Here.
And remember,

13:34.292 --> 13:35.460
don't take candy
from strangers.

13:35.590 --> 13:37.597
I mean, I'm okay,
but in the future, don't do it.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.766
I'll be waiting for you
in the bushes.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.720
<i>It was the day
of the big event,</i>

13:44.850 --> 13:47.222
<i>and my idea
was a huge success.</i>

13:49.700 --> 13:51.420
If that don't beat all--

13:51.550 --> 13:53.659
A whole car
full of jelly beans.

13:53.870 --> 13:56.500
You know,
I have been all over this county,

13:56.640 --> 13:58.727
and I ain't never seen
anything like it.

13:59.410 --> 14:00.440
- Excuse me?
- Yeah?

14:00.590 --> 14:02.200
Is the actual
jelly bean car for sale?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.400
I just think
it's a hoot and a half.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.613
Well, yes, it is.

14:04.645 --> 14:05.840
And--and after
the big event is over,

14:05.970 --> 14:07.820
I'd be happy
to make you a great deal.

14:07.950 --> 14:09.677
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
- Here.

14:09.712 --> 14:10.363
Oh, thanks.

14:11.370 --> 14:13.600
<i>Yep, we were
gonna be okay.</i>

14:13.810 --> 14:16.200
<i>2009 might have
started out bad,</i>

14:16.340 --> 14:18.150
<i>but I was working
my way back</i>

14:18.185 --> 14:20.696
<i>to zero one
jelly bean at a time.</i>

14:20.731 --> 14:21.704
And that...

14:21.990 --> 14:23.810
Hey. What do you think
you're doing?

14:24.740 --> 14:25.960
You're outside the limit.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.028
Bring it in 4 inches.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.388
There you go.

14:31.690 --> 14:32.614
Ladies and gents,

14:32.663 --> 14:34.550
thanks for coming
to Ehlert Motors.

14:34.710 --> 14:37.290
We've got great deals
on all our vehicles,

14:37.325 --> 14:39.039
so please,
don't rush off.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.270
We've got many
knowledgeable salesman

14:41.430 --> 14:43.800
and a woman
to show you around.

14:43.940 --> 14:45.663
All right,
now for the winner.

14:46.220 --> 14:53.630
There were 425,362
jelly beans in the car.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.568
So the closest guess,

14:55.940 --> 14:58.730
with 12,001 is...

14:58.840 --> 15:00.267
Cecil Hagen!

15:00.730 --> 15:02.635
Well, if
that don't beat all.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.356
Congratulations.

15:04.426 --> 15:05.660
Hey, I won!

15:07.110 --> 15:09.978
Now, kids,
when that door opens,

15:10.013 --> 15:10.990
you go ahead

15:11.120 --> 15:14.021
and scoop up all
the jelly beans you can hold.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.579
Frances, would you
like to do the honors?

15:16.870 --> 15:17.960
Me?

15:18.250 --> 15:21.057
Oh.
Well, it was my idea.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.434
Okay, everybody ready?

15:24.130 --> 15:24.900
Ready?

15:31.020 --> 15:32.017
A little stuck.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.510
Open it.

15:44.730 --> 15:47.515
Just a... Okay,
everything's okay.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.320
It's just a little
warm out today,

15:49.420 --> 15:52.366
so the jelly beans
just need a little--

15:52.540 --> 15:55.988
little bit of help
to get out, and...

15:58.990 --> 16:00.490
No, no, no, no.
No, don't go.

16:00.670 --> 16:01.470
No, don't go.
Wait. No.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.210
Oh, this will clean up
really great.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.466
You can still buy it.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.829
I'll give you a great deal.
A gr--

16:08.440 --> 16:11.475
Well, this just proves
that sometimes

16:11.476 --> 16:14.149
the best man for the job...
is a man.

16:15.420 --> 16:18.643
I'll put the cost of clean up
on your tab, Frances.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.997
This roughly makes you....
negative two.

16:22.260 --> 16:24.180
No, no. No, no,
I can fix it.

16:24.330 --> 16:26.160
Look. Here.
Wait. Wait.

16:26.530 --> 16:29.540
<i>Damn it. I was so close
to getting us out of this hole,</i>

16:29.710 --> 16:31.180
<i>but it's just getting deeper.</i>

16:31.330 --> 16:33.131
<i>And now I was supposed
to go cheer Sue</i>

16:33.166 --> 16:34.900
<i>on in swim team tryouts?</i>

16:35.030 --> 16:36.330
<i>Whoo-frickin'-hoo.</i>

16:36.470 --> 16:37.577
Where's Sue?

16:37.980 --> 16:39.347
Did I miss the tryouts?

16:39.780 --> 16:40.713
Mike,

16:40.970 --> 16:42.220
I thought
he was punished.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.071
He lured her
into the perimeter.

16:45.230 --> 16:45.989
What could I do?

16:46.500 --> 16:47.941
What is he doing?

16:48.130 --> 16:49.850
I whored myself
for that book.

16:49.990 --> 16:51.670
I promised it would be
returned safely.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.232
Hey, it got him
into the pool.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.100
Are those jelly beans
in your hair?

16:57.440 --> 17:01.100
Brick, Brick, float very
carefully over to the side.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.763
I need that book
out of the pool.

17:04.450 --> 17:05.989
Mom, mom!
You made it!

17:06.730 --> 17:07.950
I'm up.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.160
Oh, Sue, yeah.
Yeah,

17:11.310 --> 17:13.020
I made it.
I made it.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.222
I'm here now.

17:14.430 --> 17:15.926
Swim for me, baby!

17:23.156 --> 17:24.710
Okay. All right.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.021
Go, Sue! Go, Sue!

17:29.690 --> 17:32.692
<i>It wasn't her eyes.
Mike was right.</i>

17:32.953 --> 17:34.290
<i>She sucked.</i>

17:45.980 --> 17:48.240
Okay, it's fine.
It'll be fine.

17:48.380 --> 17:49.920
Yeah, we're fine.
We're fine.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.740
It's fine.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.725
Tornado!

17:53.980 --> 17:55.536
Oh, come on!

17:55.930 --> 17:57.270
It can't be a tornado.

17:57.390 --> 17:59.588
It's a beautiful,
sunny day.

18:01.050 --> 18:03.550
<i>I hate Indiana weather.</i>

18:08.600 --> 18:11.859
Mom, are
we gonna be okay?

18:12.710 --> 18:13.726
I don't know.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.782
I don't know if we're
gonna be okay, Sue.

18:18.610 --> 18:19.987
I really don't.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.004
Frankly, I have
no evidence that we will.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.695
That's not what
you're supposed to say.

18:25.010 --> 18:26.510
Oh, I know.
I know.

18:26.630 --> 18:28.400
I'm just supposed
to pick you all up

18:28.510 --> 18:30.470
and tell you
everything's gonna be fine.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.523
But you know what?
I don't know anymore!

18:34.030 --> 18:35.303
You want
to know the truth?

18:35.373 --> 18:36.757
Your dad's big on truth.

18:37.210 --> 18:40.262
Basically, our lives
suck right now.

18:40.297 --> 18:41.160
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

18:41.290 --> 18:44.030
2009 has been
a rotten, rotten year.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.400
We can't afford
a new dryer.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.980
We can't afford
unexpired food.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.212
I can't even afford the
LCD light-up angel

18:49.247 --> 18:52.022
that I ordered on the TV to
surprise you all at Christmas.

18:52.430 --> 18:53.608
Surprise!

18:54.260 --> 18:57.276
If I don't sell a car,
that means no job.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.980
That also means
maybe no house,

18:59.110 --> 19:01.850
but the tornado will probably
blow it all away anyway.

19:01.885 --> 19:04.840
Oh, my God.
Let's just pack it all in.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.500
Let's just give you kids
to Madonna or something.

19:06.620 --> 19:09.080
Your dad and I will go live
in a tent city somewhere,

19:09.200 --> 19:11.533
because the truth is,
we are screwed!

19:24.800 --> 19:28.823
But it's fine.
No, I--Everything's fine.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.477
We'll be fine.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.026
Frankie.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.217
We'll get through.

19:44.510 --> 19:45.426
Yeah.

19:45.840 --> 19:50.031
<i>Wow. Who knew I was living with
my own personal cheerleader?</i>

19:50.410 --> 19:51.820
<i>Mike was right.</i>

19:51.970 --> 19:53.310
<i>We would get through,</i>

19:53.460 --> 19:54.848

19:58.620 --> 20:01.286
<i>'Cause it doesn't matter
how big the storm</i>

20:01.321 --> 20:03.488
<i>or how much stuff
gets blown your way--</i>

20:03.690 --> 20:06.301
<i>If you have each other,
that's everything.</i>

20:06.530 --> 20:08.420
<i>'Cause there's nothing
more important than--</i>

20:08.580 --> 20:10.920
<i>Holy crap!
Is that a dryer?</i>

20:13.470 --> 20:15.570
You see it, too,
right, Mike?

20:16.240 --> 20:18.188
The tornado
gave us a dryer.

20:20.230 --> 20:22.078
Quick. Get it inside
before anybody sees.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.330
Oh, my. Whoo!

20:27.650 --> 20:30.140
<i>Our luck started to
turn around after that.</i>

20:30.290 --> 20:32.347
<i>Some stupid bank
actually approved us</i>

20:32.382 --> 20:33.800
<i>for a brand-new
credit card,</i>

20:33.970 --> 20:36.211
<i>so we paid off
Brick's library fines...</i>

20:36.950 --> 20:39.020
<i>We were able
to afford contacts for Sue,</i>

20:39.140 --> 20:40.716
<i>and she actually made
the swim team--</i>

20:40.820 --> 20:42.944
<i>Well, 34th alternate.</i>

20:43.350 --> 20:45.210
<i>And the best part of
the new credit card?</i>

20:45.330 --> 20:47.237
<i>No payments till 2012.</i>

20:47.460 --> 20:49.270
<i>And I'm sure by 2012,</i>

20:49.440 --> 20:51.120
<i>everything's gonna be great.</i>

20:51.270 --> 20:54.770
Okay. See, this is why
you never give up hope--

20:54.910 --> 20:56.600
because
anything is possible.

20:56.740 --> 20:58.750
I mean, you just never know
what's gonna happen.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.499
You just gotta hang in
there and believe and--

21:01.680 --> 21:03.960
Hot damn!
There's even clothes in there!
