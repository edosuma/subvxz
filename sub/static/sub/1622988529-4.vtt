WEBVTT

00:33.659 --> 00:34.660
Fuck.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.210
Steverino. Hey, man.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.045
It's Danny Rubin.

00:45.963 --> 00:50.259
Yeah, yeah, hi. No, I'm doing great.
I'm doing great. How about yourself?

00:50.342 --> 00:52.553
-Just ask.
-Yeah, no. She's great.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.763
They actually are both doing really great.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.641
You know, we really should try
to get them together and see if we--

00:57.724 --> 00:58.851
What's that?

00:59.434 --> 01:00.477
You did?

01:00.978 --> 01:03.814
I was-- I have a bit of news.
I'm gonna be running for office.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.984
-Ask for money.
-It is. It is great.

01:07.568 --> 01:11.530
But, you know,
it is also pricey, and so I wanted to--

01:11.613 --> 01:14.533
What? No, yes.
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

01:14.616 --> 01:18.453
All right, well, you tell Becs the same,
and I'll talk to you later.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.205
Thanks, Steve. Okay, bye.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.791
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.759
-How are you doing?
-Really great.

01:32.843 --> 01:36.430
You try asking Steven fucking Osterman
for cash.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.515
Spoiled little piece of shit.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.226
Couldn't find his own ass
from his dad's wallet at Berkeley,

01:41.310 --> 01:44.688
and now he's the CEO
of a goddamn telecom outfit?

01:45.606 --> 01:50.152
And I am exhausted.
I couldn't get back to sleep last night.

01:50.235 --> 01:53.822
I know. I am so sorry again, babe.

01:53.906 --> 01:57.868
I just-- I thought I could
just quickly go out,

01:57.951 --> 01:59.286
find a 24-hour pharmacy.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.288
And I just didn't wanna wake you.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.124
Well, you could've left a note.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.710
You could be less of a whiny little bitch.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.795
-You want some eggs Benedict?
-No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.258
Begging these rich ding-dongs
for cash upsets my stomach.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.970
Eventually, one of these rich ding-dongs
is gonna pony up.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.097
So Maya's just gone back to sleep.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.683
So can you check on her
between your calls? Thanks.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.060
Just 'cause you'll be here.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.938
Wait, what? What? What? Where--
Where are you going?

02:26.021 --> 02:27.731
I have to run a few errands.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.983
If she grouses,
just give her her eardrops.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.777
There's eggs Benedict
on the counter for you.

02:31.860 --> 02:36.031
You sound so good, baby.
Keep up the calls. Keep them up.

02:36.949 --> 02:37.950
Bye.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.828
Okay. You got here later than you'd hoped,
but you have an hour. Make it count.

02:45.791 --> 02:46.792
Hi.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.842
Hello?

02:56.635 --> 02:57.636
Greta?

03:10.107 --> 03:12.609
Holy fucking rich people.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.530
Yeah, that's every goddamn
gadget you can buy in the store.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.532
And some you can't.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.327
Ernie's got connections.
He gets things first.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.871
Everything he wants.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.581
You forget about our workout date?

03:25.664 --> 03:28.542
No, I didn't. I just couldn't make
myself get dressed this morning.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.420
You ever have one of those days
where you just can't?

03:31.503 --> 03:32.546
Yeah, I do.

03:32.629 --> 03:37.509
And you know what helps me
shake it off is a good, hard workout.

03:37.593 --> 03:38.927
I can wait. You wanna go change?

03:39.011 --> 03:41.722
Into someone who isn't a lazy,
spoiled mess?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.682
I think Ernie's having an affair.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.145
-He's hiding something. I know it.
-I'm so sorry.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.230
It's my fault.
I pulled a bait-and-switch on him.

03:50.314 --> 03:54.526
He married one woman and he got… this.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.486
You know what I did this morning?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.989
I got up before anyone,
before the sun rose.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.116
I could've done anything.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.535
I could've gone for a jog.
And you know what I did?

04:03.619 --> 04:06.872
I baked a batch of oatmeal cookies,
then I ate them all

04:06.955 --> 04:08.624
one by one while the sun came up.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.877
So I don't think there's much point
in working out.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.086
Not now.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.798
You know exactly how she feels.
Shame, rinse, repeat.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.176
You can't do anything about that now,

04:19.259 --> 04:24.431
but you can change this moment right now
if you move and you sweat.

04:25.641 --> 04:26.642
I promise.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.186
I guess.

04:30.854 --> 04:34.733
One brick today, one brick tomorrow,
and pretty soon you've built something.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.944
Something solid that's all yours.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.404
Yeah, thank you. I just-- I can't.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.700
I'm sorry. I'm gonna see
if Miriam's defrosting the chicken.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.877
Fuck it.
You're not leaving here empty-handed.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.048
It's one video camera.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.551
You saw how many goddamn gadgets he had.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.636
He probably won't even notice it's gone.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.931
Rich asshole like him with more money
than he knows what to do with.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.140
Hey.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.559
Oh, my God.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.394
-I didn't see you there.
-Sorry.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.979
Didn't mean to scare ya.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.941
I just wanted to see if you and Danny
were gonna join us on Thursday.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.651
The club.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.571
Did Greta forget to invite you?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.614
I think she might've.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.575
Okay. Well, it's grunion run time,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.452
and the beach club does a big,
big party every year.

05:27.536 --> 05:31.164
Lots of fun, very casual.
Beer in the bottle. That kind of thing.

05:31.707 --> 05:35.627
Perfect chance to press some flesh,
spread the word about Danny's campaign.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.130
Yes, of course. That sounds--
Yes, we'll be there.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.048
All righty. See you then.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.384
Ahoy!

05:43.302 --> 05:44.428
Okay.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.389
Drive, you fucking idiot.

05:53.896 --> 05:54.897
Shit.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.110
You don't have a couch in the van?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.821
I don't have a fucking couch, man.
I had to get rid of it.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.865
-I got bedbugs in the couch.
-What?

06:04.948 --> 06:07.326
-Shit. So you did have one in there.
-Oh, God.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.494
-I did.
-Oh, God. That is the best.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.372
I fit a whole couch in there
and then fixed the--

06:14.541 --> 06:16.877
Tequila Sheila.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.088
You get in here and give me some love.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.258
He's always gotta press it up against you.

06:23.342 --> 06:28.305
Your hair smells exactly the same,
like lady parts and pineapple.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.767
Jerry. What? Gosh, it's been so long.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.644
What brings you down here?

06:33.727 --> 06:38.357
And in this corner,
heavyweight champion of Bay Area activism

06:38.440 --> 06:42.986
and my new campaign manager,
Jerry Goldman!

06:43.070 --> 06:46.323
Oh, man. Back together again.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.618
-Like beans and rice.
-Like dykes and dogs.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.329
Can I talk to you for a second?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.413
-Me?
-Yeah.

06:53.497 --> 06:54.957
-Okay, yeah.
-Right back, lovebirds.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.501
-I'm gonna drain the vein, okay?
-Okay.

06:59.336 --> 07:03.757
Babe. Before you start, okay,
Jerry does this for a living.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.176
I mean, he got Stanley Bukowski
elected up there, you know?

07:06.260 --> 07:09.179
And Stanley,
he thought Lenin was too open-minded.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.558
This isn't San Francisco,
and he doesn't know the community,

07:12.641 --> 07:15.477
and they don't go with flows here.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.771
Can you give him some credit, all right?

07:17.855 --> 07:20.983
Jerry is going to help me do
a lot of the big work

07:21.066 --> 07:22.860
and still stay true to myself.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.946
I just wish that we talked about it first.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.574
I'm assuming
that he's not doing this for free.

07:28.657 --> 07:31.201
We decided to use our savings.
What the hell else are they for?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.620
The savings are imaginary. A ghost.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.456
Couldn't help but overhear.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.417
I hate to take dinero from comrades,

07:38.500 --> 07:41.044
but I'm actually gonna need
that money pronto.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.548
-Just kind of my policy in this capacity.
-Of course, Jer.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.592
No, we totally respect that.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.510
You know what I've been
dreaming of lately?

07:48.594 --> 07:51.263
That it's ten years ago
and you're still relevant?

07:51.346 --> 07:52.973
Those falafel balls you used to make.

07:53.056 --> 07:57.144
I could put away a dozen of those,
and maybe another cold beer to go with?

08:01.023 --> 08:02.858
Jerry, everybody slept with Trish.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.068
-That's not an accomplishment.
-Oh, man.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.697
If everyone did it,
what makes it special that you did it?

08:08.780 --> 08:09.907
Even Ricky?

08:11.366 --> 08:14.286
Six times. Junior year.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.038
No.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.582
Why didn't I get to do that?

08:18.665 --> 08:21.668
Well, I mean, I thought every single
professor I had was attractive.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.046
I don't know. Yes, every one of them.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.716
I don't know if that means
I love education or sex.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.465
-Need some chairs, tables.
-Forget chairs.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.550
You're out there living.

09:09.633 --> 09:10.759
-Hey--
-True, man.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.511
-It's about money…
-Were you boiling eggs?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.930
-…we need to get the ground game going.
-Huh? Oh, shit. Yeah, sorry.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.392
-We went on a sunrise brainstorm session.
-We need to mobilize three groups.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.853
-Maya's still sleeping.
-The geezers, wheezers,

09:20.936 --> 09:22.104
and the teasers.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.648
Now, the geezers are the old folks.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.318
The wheezers are the people
concerned about air quality.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.320
-Actually. Before I forget…
-And the--

09:30.404 --> 09:33.198
…Ernie invited us to the grunion run party
at the Shore Club.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.534
He said it'd be a smart way
to drum up some support.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.537
-All right.
-The Shore Club? Like a country club?

09:38.620 --> 09:40.581
That's not your scene, Dan Man.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.125
Yeah, but if we're talking
about raising money--

09:43.208 --> 09:47.004
Well, I defer to your hard-earned
expertise on country clubs, Sheil.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.840
I mean, does this Dinah Shore joint
even let Jews in?

09:50.424 --> 09:53.218
-As of seven years ago, yes.
-Seven years.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.928
You know, it could be a good idea.

09:55.012 --> 09:59.183
I don't know. Maybe make a few more
high-profile contacts, maybe?

10:01.977 --> 10:04.730
Okay. I get it.

10:06.106 --> 10:10.736
In Reagan San Diego,
you have to kiss some soft, white ass.

10:11.236 --> 10:17.451
But word to the wise,
don't try to play by their rules.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.535
You won't win.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.121
And I'm not just talking
about the election.

10:21.205 --> 10:25.167
In your soul,
you will feel like a pandering schmuck.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.544
You need to hold on to your integrity

10:27.628 --> 10:30.464
like it's the last piece of tail
before the firing squad.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.593
Because at the end of the day,
brother, that's all you got.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.303
Yeah.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.640
No one is talking about losing integrity.

10:40.432 --> 10:43.977
It's a cocktail party
full of people with money.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.940
Which is what you like to get paid with.
Right, Jer?

10:48.023 --> 10:50.234
You mean that thing
that you grew up with, Sheil?

10:51.443 --> 10:53.570
Are your parents providing any ducats
to this campaign…

10:53.654 --> 10:54.655
-Okay.
-…speaking of,

10:54.738 --> 10:57.115
or are we all still pretending
like they don't exist?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.743
That's enough, Jer. Come on.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.746
Hey, I never told you who the teasers are.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.374
The teasers are the ladies.

11:05.457 --> 11:08.377
The gals who are going to fall
for your charm

11:08.460 --> 11:12.005
and drag their dipshit husbands
to the voting booths to vote with them.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.173
Am I right?

11:14.258 --> 11:17.928
The hair of the pussy
can pull a freight train.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.848
You know that better than anybody.

11:27.980 --> 11:31.358
Raise it a little bit
and put it in the center.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.695
Yeah, center it a little bit.
And a little to the left.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.118
What's all this?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.120
Bunny and me are moving back into the van.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.831
Need to stay, you know, nimble.

11:45.914 --> 11:50.335
Hey, did you give any more thought
to the whole, like, campaign video thing?

11:50.836 --> 11:52.671
'Cause I got some ideas.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.425
Like Endless Summer
meets Triumph of the Will.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.970
I do, but class is starting,
so I gotta get in there.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.346
You got a good crowd in there.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.850
-You uncomfortable?
-Yes.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.768
-You wanna stop?
-Yes.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.812
Good. That's the sweet spot.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.148
That's where the change happens.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.027
Gonna push through.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.405
Now do what you don't wanna do.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.159
High knees in three, two, one,

12:22.242 --> 12:26.330
together and four, three, two, one.

12:29.708 --> 12:33.003
"A little brown bear
ate all his berries and cream,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.881
But he was still a little hungry bear.

12:35.964 --> 12:39.426
Said to his mommy,
'Can't I have just one more berry?'

12:39.510 --> 12:42.054
And she said,
'Little bear, we mustn't be greedy.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.891
There must be enough
to last the very long winter ahead.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.602
Now it's time to go to sleep,
my precious one.'

12:51.146 --> 12:54.900
But grumbly tummies
don't make for sleepy little bears."

12:59.112 --> 13:03.325
-It's not forever, you know. It's just--
-Is he helping us or are we helping him?

13:03.408 --> 13:05.244
Well, why can't it be both?

13:05.327 --> 13:07.079
I got into this campaign
to make a difference

13:07.162 --> 13:08.830
and Jerry keeps me honest.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.666
I'm worried that he's gonna distract you.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.919
The Shore Club. I mean, yes,
that's the Establishment, but--

13:14.002 --> 13:17.339
Do you remember
when you brought me to the Golf Club?

13:18.924 --> 13:23.387
Who do you think that ticked off more?
Your dad or your mom?

13:25.347 --> 13:31.311
This liberal Jew pawing at you
at the table reeking of Maui Wowie.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.022
You know, sometimes I think
you only started dating me

13:34.106 --> 13:35.232
just to piss them off.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.695
I really think the Shore Club,

13:39.778 --> 13:42.406
if you show those people
who you really are,

13:42.489 --> 13:43.866
they'll respond.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.869
They'll write checks. How could they not?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.496
And it wasn't just to piss them off.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.041
But that was pretty great too.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.560
Of course John Breem is here.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.604
Is that his wife? She's really pretty.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.189
Except for the nose.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.274
Hi.

14:17.941 --> 14:18.984
Hi.

14:19.067 --> 14:24.156
-Oh, my God. You look amazing.
-So do you. Gosh. Those colors.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.533
Yeah, I'm-- Yes, colorful.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.119
Where's Danny?

14:29.995 --> 14:32.539
He just had to do some work
with our new campaign manager,

14:32.623 --> 14:33.957
but he should be here any minute.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.668
Okay,
'cause Breem brought the competition,

14:36.752 --> 14:40.422
and we don't want Mike Schmidt gobbling up
all the shrimp cocktail donations, do we?

14:41.590 --> 14:42.633
That's funny.

14:43.967 --> 14:47.513
Hey, there's Chuck Ternes.
I should go say hey while I'm still sober.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.097
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.811
He used to always get me a drink,
and now I gotta get my own.

14:56.522 --> 14:59.149
All couples take each other
for granted eventually.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.526
Yes.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.736
Maybe she's here,
the woman he's sleeping with, right?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.739
It'd be so-- I wonder who it is.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.950
I wonder if I know her.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.872
It's too bad, man.
I really liked Brandy a lot--

15:13.956 --> 15:16.291
-Brenda. Yeah.
-Brenda. Yeah.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.379
-I thought she'd be different.
-Me too.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.298
I thought she was the one.

15:24.174 --> 15:27.135
I mean, she studied library sciences.
How fucking cute is that?

15:28.303 --> 15:32.057
But she turned out to be
another money-grubbing bitch.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.519
That's rough, dude. I'm sorry.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.480
Yeah. Not gonna lie, it's disappointing.

15:39.815 --> 15:43.652
I mean, in the old days
there was no separation.

15:43.735 --> 15:47.948
Work, play, drugs, sex.
It was all for a better world.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.158
These days…

15:51.535 --> 15:55.122
-Fuck.
-It's all rules, expectations.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.374
-Exactly. Exactly, man.
-Right?

15:58.333 --> 16:01.753
I hate to admit it, but I think it's over.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.260
We gotta get going.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.722
-Nah, man. Let's just hang out.
-Oh, my Goddess.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.099
You guys came out
from the grunion run too?

16:14.183 --> 16:15.517
-Yeah.
-Of course you did.

16:15.601 --> 16:18.812
It's the most magical night of the year.
This was meant to be.

16:19.521 --> 16:23.108
-Come on. Let's go. Come on!
-Yeah, okay. Jerry.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.985
-Yeah.
-All right. Yeah.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.864
I just don't get how they always remember.

16:28.947 --> 16:32.367
Well, it's their mating ritual.
So it's pretty important to them.

16:32.868 --> 16:35.120
But every year, the exact same spot?

16:35.204 --> 16:36.705
They're fish. How do they know?

16:36.788 --> 16:40.792
The reproductive drive,
it's a powerful and elemental force--

16:40.876 --> 16:42.294
I guess we'll never understand it.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.171
And we don't have to.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.964
God's will doesn't have to make sense
to us.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.258
It's science. What doesn't make sense

16:48.342 --> 16:51.345
is how you fuckwits get to have
so much money and power.

16:51.428 --> 16:54.848
It's one of the beautiful mysteries
of the ocean

16:54.932 --> 16:57.142
that we're so blessed to enjoy
in our community,

16:57.226 --> 17:01.480
-and why it's so important to protect it.
-I'm always saying that too.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.524
You must meet my husband.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.901
His whole conservation platform

17:05.983 --> 17:09.279
is about preserving our coastline
from destruction and development.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.323
Well, where is he? Get him over here.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.867
That's a good question.
Where the fuck is he?

17:41.311 --> 17:44.356
Of course, the fish themselves
are disgusting, inedible.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.691
They are not that bad.

17:45.774 --> 17:50.195
Greasy, smelly,
like mackerel someone left in the sun.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.198
I seem to remember you enjoying them
an awful lot last year.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.326
And so did you.
So don't act like you're so picky.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.080
Good. It's the Harrisons.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.040
Thought they were spending
the summer in Tahoe.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.208
Come on, Sheils.

18:06.295 --> 18:08.046
That asshole's not coming.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.052
Going for a swim?

18:16.889 --> 18:18.223
I didn't bring my suit.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.395
Skinny dip in the moonlight then?

18:26.648 --> 18:28.358
I know the club lets democrats in now,

18:28.442 --> 18:31.153
but I'm pretty sure
that nudists are still off-limits.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.540
Any sign of the grunion?

18:43.624 --> 18:44.708
Not yet.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.629
-Hope we didn't scare them off.
-Nah.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.964
They're much too stupid
to be scared of us.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.591
I wouldn't underestimate them.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.052
You like to say
that you can't stop progress?

18:55.677 --> 18:56.762
Try stopping nature.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.015
Is that what I said?

19:02.976 --> 19:05.812
I guess it must be.
Struck such a chord with you.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.778
-What the hell was that?
-'Scuse me.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.029
Was nice talking to you.

19:29.378 --> 19:33.841
It's happening,
and it's fucking beautiful.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.661
You have a real aptitude
for this apparently.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.247
Watching horny fish get caught?

20:08.125 --> 20:10.169
Getting people to open their wallets.

20:10.669 --> 20:16.592
Charming the uncharmable.
Chuck, Lisa Harrison, the Suttons.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.970
Preston Beale resents
giving pennies to UNICEF,

20:20.053 --> 20:22.139
but he says he's writing you a check.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.640
Well, I haven't had a chance

20:23.724 --> 20:27.144
to ask you what you'll be contributing
to Danny's campaign yet.

20:29.938 --> 20:30.939
I'll tell you what.

20:31.815 --> 20:34.735
Whatever you raise tonight, I'll match it.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.988
And I hope Danny appreciates it.

20:39.615 --> 20:40.866
Wherever he is.

21:03.764 --> 21:06.850
Hi, Mrs… Rubin I--

21:06.934 --> 21:08.977
Maya went down at 7:30.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.331
Tequila Sheila.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.875
You want one of these little fuckers?
They're pretty rank--

21:31.959 --> 21:33.627
The party is over.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.089
Party is over!

21:39.675 --> 21:40.968
Hey!

21:41.051 --> 21:45.389
Did you see the grunion?
You wanna know my theory?

21:46.098 --> 21:47.099
I'm good.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.275
There she is.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.360
Foxy face.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.071
Foxy wife.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.616
How lucky am I, huh? Have so much--

22:05.909 --> 22:07.411
What the fuck?

22:08.036 --> 22:09.955
-Jesus--
-Where the fuck were you?

22:10.038 --> 22:16.420
Okay. We were headed over,
and then we ran into some supporters

22:16.503 --> 22:19.006
and we started talking campaign talk,

22:19.089 --> 22:20.716
and then they were going to the beach.

22:20.799 --> 22:23.635
-We were going that way anyways--
-All by myself all night long!

22:23.719 --> 22:24.970
No idea where you were,

22:25.053 --> 22:28.932
apologizing for you to Ernie,
to everybody like some fucking idiot.

22:29.016 --> 22:32.519
I tried to tell you
that that is not my scene.

22:32.603 --> 22:33.812
Well, you think it's mine?

22:33.896 --> 22:37.107
You think I wanna be there by myself
fucking asking these people for money

22:37.191 --> 22:38.901
for someone who couldn't even show up?

22:38.984 --> 22:41.653
Okay, let's just… Can we shh for a second?

22:41.737 --> 22:45.157
How high are you right now
because you look fucking ridiculous.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.118
-What are you wearing?
-I found this at the beach

22:48.202 --> 22:51.205
and it is keeping me safe, and I am high.

22:51.288 --> 22:53.332
And I'll tell you what, you should be too.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.585
Because what the fuck
is going on with you, huh?

22:56.668 --> 22:58.712
Are you trying to put this on me?

22:58.795 --> 23:03.717
What? No. Yes. Yes, because at one point,
you used to be a pretty cool chick.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.429
You-- Yeah, I have never been cool.

23:07.513 --> 23:10.349
I only just fucking pretend to be cool
for you, you fucking--

23:11.517 --> 23:14.853
All right, all right, all right.

23:14.937 --> 23:18.315
-You are really goddamn strong.
-Fuck off.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.399
Okay.

23:22.819 --> 23:23.987
I fucked up.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.824
I fucked up. Hey. Okay?

23:27.908 --> 23:32.120
I should've been there, and I wasn't.
All right, babe?

23:33.205 --> 23:34.414
I'm really fucking sorry.

23:34.498 --> 23:39.670
I succumbed to the easy path as per usual,
all right?

23:39.753 --> 23:45.008
But you are the fucking sun to me.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.343
You know that, right?

23:47.553 --> 23:49.429
And none of this
was happening without you.

23:49.513 --> 23:52.015
You saved it.
You thought of Save Our Wave.

23:52.099 --> 23:56.103
You just summoned that out of nothing
like a fucking sorceress.

23:56.186 --> 23:57.938
A visionary.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.107
Now look, maybe you don't think
that you're cool,

24:00.190 --> 24:03.235
but from where I'm sitting…

24:04.444 --> 24:08.240
you are the coolest fucking chick
who has ever walked this earth.

24:09.408 --> 24:13.370
I raised $2,000 tonight without your help.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.414
Hell yes, babe.

24:15.497 --> 24:19.001
God, do you not see
what a fucking rock star you are?

24:19.084 --> 24:20.669
I mean, holy shit.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.756
Do you want this?

24:26.258 --> 24:29.261
Yes. More than anything.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.598
Then you gotta step up.

24:41.607 --> 24:42.774
Oh, man.

24:43.984 --> 24:46.778
Hey, babe. I got this. This is my mess.

24:46.862 --> 24:48.822
I'll take care of it, all right.
You go get some rest.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.408
-Really?
-Yeah.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.839
Today will be different.
Today will be better.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.426
Today you will speak out, be heard.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.890
It's for you, babe.

25:14.973 --> 25:17.226
And can you--
Can you start another pot of coffee?

25:17.309 --> 25:20.020
We're dragging ass. A lot of work to do.

25:20.103 --> 25:21.522
-Hello?
-Hey.

25:21.605 --> 25:23.482
Sorry to call you so early,
but I have to cancel

25:23.565 --> 25:24.900
our workout appointment again.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.568
-Greta--
-Pick me up.

25:26.652 --> 25:28.362
Apparently our new video camera
went missing.

25:28.445 --> 25:31.198
It's gotta be around here somewhere,
but Ernie's, like, going berserk.

25:31.281 --> 25:33.283
-I-- Yeah.
-Pick me up.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.660
-I'm so sorry.
-Pick me up.

25:34.743 --> 25:36.662
-I hope that it turns up.
-Pick me up.

25:36.745 --> 25:39.748
Yeah, so do I.
Anyway, I'll see you at school. Bye.

25:40.874 --> 25:43.794
-Yeah. Come on. Come on. Come on.
-Pick me up. Pick me up.

25:44.294 --> 25:45.629
Pick me up.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.464
-So--
-Up, up, up.

25:47.548 --> 25:49.800
-I'm hungry, hungry, hungry.
-Yeah? What do you want?

25:49.883 --> 25:52.302
-Hungry. I'm hungry.
-So, I--

25:52.386 --> 25:53.720
I have an idea.

25:53.804 --> 25:58.559
I thought we could do a campaign video
for Save Our Wave.

25:58.642 --> 26:01.436
-There's a young filmmaker…
-Peanut butter.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.272
…with a really compelling visual sense.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.398
He's actually a surfer.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.692
And I thought we could enlist him
like with these images,

26:06.775 --> 26:09.820
-and combine the cultural--
-Babe, babe, babe. Seriously.

26:10.946 --> 26:12.698
We're dying over here. The coffee?

26:27.963 --> 26:30.632
You can take her
since you're home working.

26:30.716 --> 26:32.676
Wait, what? Where are you going?

26:33.260 --> 26:34.261
Out.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.598
Maybe she's on her rag?

27:26.021 --> 27:28.232
Rad. I'm starving.

27:39.368 --> 27:41.495
Holy shit.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.332
That is a sweet piece of machinery
right there.

27:47.251 --> 27:49.545
Are you finally ready to make
that campaign video?

27:50.379 --> 27:52.089
Fuck the campaign video.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.842
I'm ready to make a fortune.
