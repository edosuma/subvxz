WEBVTT

00:00.594 --> 00:01.543
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.600 --> 00:03.200
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.534 --> 00:05.260
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.498 --> 00:06.520
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.921 --> 00:07.521
Who am I?

00:07.610 --> 00:08.749
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.750 --> 00:09.150
Castle.

00:09.184 --> 00:09.844
Castle.

00:09.845 --> 00:11.545
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.599 --> 00:13.789
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:13.999 --> 00:14.818
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.065 --> 00:16.332
Beckett.
Aah!

00:16.605 --> 00:18.690
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?

00:19.041 --> 00:20.925
<i>And thanks to my friendship</i>
<i>with the mayor,</i>

00:20.976 --> 00:22.610
<i>I get to be on her case.</i>
Oh!

00:22.644 --> 00:25.213
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:25.247 --> 00:26.881
<i>And together,</i>
<i>we catch killers.</i>

00:27.429 --> 00:30.331
I hate this case.
I know. Isn't it great?

00:57.742 --> 00:59.676
Breakfast time.

00:59.711 --> 01:03.748
Oh. What did I do
to deserve this,

01:03.789 --> 01:06.258
other than, you know,
being me?

01:06.292 --> 01:07.959
Isn't that enough?

01:07.994 --> 01:10.662
Okay,
what do you want?

01:10.696 --> 01:13.131
Nothing. Why do I have to
want something?

01:13.166 --> 01:15.066
March 1999, you wanted
a Hello Kitty backpack.

01:15.101 --> 01:17.469
I got french toast with
a whipped cream smiley face.

01:17.503 --> 01:20.205
October 2004, you wanted
a set of mint condition

01:20.239 --> 01:23.240
"Empire Strikes Back"
lightsabers.

01:23.581 --> 01:26.649
I got an omelet
shaped like Darth Vader.

01:26.684 --> 01:28.751
Okay. I want a Vespa.

01:28.786 --> 01:31.754
It's a scooter.
All my friends have them,

01:31.789 --> 01:34.190
and it would make getting around
the city so much easier,

01:34.224 --> 01:35.658
and they're totally safe.
Honey.

01:35.693 --> 01:36.994
I'll always wear a helmet,
and I'll never drive at night.

01:37.039 --> 01:38.486
You know how responsible I am.

01:38.496 --> 01:40.196
It's not you I'm worried about.
Driving in New York,

01:40.284 --> 01:42.986
It's like a-a Mad Max movie.
Dad, I really want this.

01:43.689 --> 01:45.456
Will you at least
think about it?

01:45.491 --> 01:47.358
Please.

01:49.528 --> 01:51.763
Yes, I will think about it

01:51.797 --> 01:54.666
if you leave me alone so that
I can finish my breakfast.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.668
Deal.

01:56.702 --> 01:59.637
Ah, it's Beckett.
Uh...Remember what happened

01:59.672 --> 02:02.507
last time you went to
a crime scene on a full stomach?

02:03.517 --> 02:04.617
Yeah.

02:04.652 --> 02:05.885
Oh.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.020
Castle.

02:09.223 --> 02:11.391
And who is
the unlucky winner today?

02:11.425 --> 02:14.460
Deon Carver, bail bondsman.
This is his office.

02:14.495 --> 02:16.429
He walked into a B&E
last night,

02:16.463 --> 02:19.532
and before he had a chance
to use his registered firearm,

02:19.567 --> 02:21.467
our killer knocked him
over the head with that.

02:21.502 --> 02:23.503
A sharpshooter award.

02:23.537 --> 02:25.939
That is ironic
on so many levels.

02:25.973 --> 02:27.574
No, just two.

02:27.608 --> 02:30.243
Our killer left a partial
shoe print in Carver's blood,

02:30.277 --> 02:32.378
probably while wiping
the trophy clean.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.948
Shoe print isn't complete enough
to tell the size,

02:34.982 --> 02:37.016
but the tread mark should be
easy to identify.

02:37.051 --> 02:40.206
And then before leaving,
our killer was nice enough

02:40.207 --> 02:42.675
to call 9-1-1 and leave
the phone off the hook.

02:42.710 --> 02:44.677
Someone was feeling
a little guilty?

02:44.712 --> 02:48.014
Not too guilty.
The call came in at 11:00.

02:48.048 --> 02:49.916
I'm estimating time of death
around 10:00.

02:49.950 --> 02:52.318
Which means our perp had about
an hour to ransack the place.

02:52.353 --> 02:54.320
Looking for what?

02:54.355 --> 02:57.924
Um, money? I mean, bail bondsmen
often get paid in cash.

02:57.958 --> 03:00.026
And 10% of a million

03:00.060 --> 03:02.829
would be enough reason
to tear up a place.

03:02.863 --> 03:04.764
Ryan and Esposito are taking
a look around the building

03:04.798 --> 03:06.899
for any security cameras.
That's a negative on cameras.

03:25.151 --> 03:27.620
Why would a calculator
cause feedback?

03:27.711 --> 03:30.612
It's not a calculator.

03:30.647 --> 03:33.349
It's a bug.

03:33.383 --> 03:35.684
A wireless R.F. transmitter
to be precise.

03:35.719 --> 03:37.152
Not to be confused

03:37.187 --> 03:40.010
with the more advanced
infrared signal burst device.

03:40.222 --> 03:41.656
Book research?
Nanny Cam.

03:41.928 --> 03:44.129
So... do you think
that the robbery

03:44.164 --> 03:46.332
was just a pretense
for the placement of the bug,

03:46.342 --> 03:49.178
and then the killer was caught in the act?
Well, it's not Watergate, Castle.

03:49.212 --> 03:51.013
If the point
was to bug Carver's office,

03:51.037 --> 03:52.414
then why leave it here once he's dead?

03:52.424 --> 03:54.037
Well, tell me this, miss know-it-all.
Mm-hmm.

03:54.107 --> 03:57.857
Who would want to bug
a burly bail bondsman so badly?

03:58.921 --> 03:59.422
Okay.

03:59.513 --> 04:00.947
Thank you.

04:01.572 --> 04:04.274
So it's not law enforcement
or a 3-letter agency.

04:04.308 --> 04:05.743
That bug was
a commercial device.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.561
I contacted the manufacturer
in Thailand.

04:07.634 --> 04:08.801
They're looking up
the serial number

04:08.871 --> 04:10.805
to see what store
it was shipped to,

04:10.839 --> 04:12.375
and hopefully from there, we
should find out who bought it.

04:12.470 --> 04:14.793
Mm. I remember when killers
used to buy American.

04:14.803 --> 04:17.539
Yo, I ran the shoe print through
the new federal database.

04:17.639 --> 04:19.474
They matched the tread mark
to these loafers here.

04:19.507 --> 04:21.274
Ah, the no-hassle tassel.

04:22.499 --> 04:25.335
These were the height
of fashion... in 1984.

04:25.869 --> 04:26.870
These are photos

04:26.905 --> 04:28.940
of all of Carver's clients
with a history of violence.

04:28.974 --> 04:30.442
Can you show them
around his building,

04:30.478 --> 04:33.246
see if anyone was there yesterday?
Yeah, you got it.

04:34.946 --> 04:36.947
You were a girl once.

04:37.409 --> 04:38.407
Still am.

04:38.417 --> 04:39.902
Can you tell me why my daughter
wants one of these so badly?

04:39.978 --> 04:42.146
Well,
bikes are what girls want

04:42.180 --> 04:44.815
when we realize we're never
gonna get a pony.

04:44.849 --> 04:47.484
Did you have one?
I still do.

04:47.519 --> 04:49.086
'94 Harley Softail.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.121
Worked all of high school
to pay for it.

04:52.065 --> 04:53.366
And how did your parents
feel about it?

04:53.371 --> 04:55.773
Well, my dad threatened
to send me to a nunnery.

04:55.807 --> 04:57.708
And my mom just shook her head
and said,

04:57.785 --> 04:59.652
"Katie, every time
you ride that thing,

04:59.686 --> 05:01.421
"just remember
how much you hate

05:01.455 --> 05:03.523
hearing me tell you
'I told you so.'"

05:03.557 --> 05:05.223
You know what this means,
though, don't you?

05:05.902 --> 05:07.302
No, what?

05:07.679 --> 05:11.048
Well, Alexis is entering
her wild-child phase.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.194
My daughter?
Nah. I don't think so.

05:13.195 --> 05:15.096
Oh, yeah, Castle.
All girls go through it.

05:15.131 --> 05:16.698
And good girls
are the worst.

05:17.959 --> 05:21.529
In fact, I remember
this one time when...

05:21.607 --> 05:24.276
Hey, did you find anything?
Yeah.

05:24.310 --> 05:26.311
We located
Carver's wife--Brooke.

05:26.345 --> 05:27.480
She's visiting her sister
in Hoboken.

05:27.490 --> 05:29.391
Uniforms are on their way
to pick her up now.

05:29.426 --> 05:31.927
Oh, and Lanie called. She said
she found something weird.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.577
I found this hidden
in Carver's sock

05:35.611 --> 05:37.746
while I was stripping
the body.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.148
What the hell is it?

05:39.156 --> 05:41.791
I don't know.
You're the Detective.

05:41.825 --> 05:43.926
Maybe it's what our killer was
looking for in Carver's office.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.162
Seriously? That?

05:46.196 --> 05:49.932
Yeah. Well, it's probably
some complex code or a--

05:49.966 --> 05:51.667
the world's
least-interesting doodle?

05:53.288 --> 05:54.990
It's not something that
you kill a guy over.

05:55.058 --> 05:57.893
Then why did he hide it?

05:57.928 --> 06:00.563
I told my husband,

06:00.597 --> 06:02.398
the kind of animals
he dealt with every day,

06:02.432 --> 06:03.866
something bad
was gonna happen.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.035
Mrs. Carver, had your husband
had any troubles

06:06.069 --> 06:07.803
with any of his clients
recently?

06:07.838 --> 06:11.240
Deon didn't talk about work
a lot with me.

06:12.351 --> 06:13.785
Oh, but he did say

06:13.820 --> 06:16.354
that he had to straighten
someone out yesterday.

06:16.389 --> 06:18.657
He said it got pretty ugly.

06:18.691 --> 06:20.192
Any idea who?

06:20.226 --> 06:22.561
I'm sorry, no.

06:22.595 --> 06:25.397
Did your husband keep cash
in his office?

06:25.431 --> 06:26.865
Uh, no.

06:26.899 --> 06:30.335
He insisted on money orders
and cashier's checks.

06:30.369 --> 06:33.171
He had a good heart,
but he wasn't stupid.

06:37.243 --> 06:39.077
We found this

06:39.112 --> 06:41.813
folded up
in your husband's sock.

06:41.848 --> 06:45.117
Any idea what it is?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.283
I've never
seen this before.

06:51.058 --> 06:52.993
Just because
she doesn't recognize it

06:53.027 --> 06:55.729
doesn't mean it's not important.
Brooke even admitted...

06:55.763 --> 06:58.465
Carver never talked to her about work.
Castle.

06:58.499 --> 07:00.634
I'm just saying, my spidey sense
is tingling about this.

07:00.703 --> 07:02.670
Well, I can't base
an entire murder investigation

07:02.705 --> 07:03.847
on your spidey senses.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.692
Why not? Our killer
was looking for something.

07:06.021 --> 07:07.922
Our victim
was hiding something.

07:07.956 --> 07:10.257
<i>Res ipsa loquitur.</i>
It means--

07:10.325 --> 07:12.960
"the thing speaks for itself."
I know. All I'm saying

07:12.995 --> 07:15.363
is that even though Carver
didn't keep cash in his offices,

07:15.397 --> 07:17.531
it doesn't mean that it wasn't
an attempted robbery.

07:17.566 --> 07:20.501
I mean, these aren't Mensa
members we're talking about.

07:20.535 --> 07:23.404
Hey, Beckett. Waitress at, uh,
the diner in Carver's building

07:23.438 --> 07:25.473
said that she saw Carver
and one of his clients

07:25.507 --> 07:27.642
get into a shouting match
last night.

07:27.676 --> 07:28.788
Some skell named Random Pierce.

07:29.598 --> 07:31.367
Somebody actually
named their kid Random?

07:32.026 --> 07:33.494
No wonder he turned
to a life of crime.

07:33.516 --> 07:36.723
Random just did two years
at Five Points Correctional

07:36.886 --> 07:39.687
and a week after he got out,
he was arrested for a B&E.

07:40.237 --> 07:41.337
That sounds like
a real winner.

07:41.352 --> 07:43.286
Waitress said that
she heard him tell Carver

07:43.320 --> 07:46.556
that if he didn't give it back
that Random was gonna take it.

07:46.590 --> 07:49.258
Hmm. Well, I wonder
what "it" could be.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.306
So Random had a court hearing
scheduled for this morning.

07:53.383 --> 07:54.244
He didn't show.

07:54.369 --> 07:56.427
They issued a bench warrant
for his arrest at 9:00 A.M.

07:56.437 --> 07:57.742
Let's go pick him up.

08:01.412 --> 08:03.013
This was Random's
last known address.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.763
All right,
you guys take the back.

08:04.996 --> 08:07.397
So this Harley of yours,
do you have any pictures?

08:07.431 --> 08:08.799
Uh, yeah, I do.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.558
But I'm not gonna be showing
any of them to you.

08:10.568 --> 08:12.039
Why not?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.861
Well, because I don't think
you can handle the sight of me

08:15.905 --> 08:18.173
straddling it
in tight black leather.

08:18.208 --> 08:22.010
I'm <i>so</i> not getting
a scooter for my daughter.

08:22.045 --> 08:24.012
Police! Stop!
Stop!

08:24.080 --> 08:24.790
That's Random.

08:25.410 --> 08:27.211
NYPD, stop!

08:30.048 --> 08:32.448
Hey!

08:40.727 --> 08:43.697
I've always wanted to do that!

08:56.711 --> 08:59.380
Oh!

08:59.465 --> 09:00.632
Ow! Ow!

09:00.666 --> 09:02.435
What the hell are you doing?
That's my suspect.

09:02.516 --> 09:04.918
Okay, relax.
We're on the same team.

09:06.398 --> 09:08.432
Royce?

09:10.068 --> 09:11.303
Hey, kid.

09:11.311 --> 09:12.778
Long time.

09:12.812 --> 09:14.280
Yeah, too long.

09:14.314 --> 09:16.682
Nice driving.
Aw, thanks.

09:16.716 --> 09:18.851
Mike Royce, bounty hunter.
Boom.

09:18.928 --> 09:21.563
Ah, Richard Castle, the writer.

09:21.597 --> 09:23.465
Royce used to be on the job.

09:23.499 --> 09:25.967
"On the job"? She says that
like I'm any cop.

09:26.001 --> 09:28.937
I was her training officer
when she left the Academy.

09:28.938 --> 09:31.906
Hey, hey, hey, hey, if I'm
imposing on your happy reunion

09:31.941 --> 09:33.775
you know, I could just go.

09:33.809 --> 09:36.444
The only place you're goin'
is jail.

You let me go, I'll give him a call.
Shut up and get in the box.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.659
No wonder that guy was getting
away. Look at your shoes.
What?

09:54.694 --> 09:56.661
How many inches
are those heels?

09:56.696 --> 09:58.663
My shoes are fine,
and he wasn't getting away.

10:03.156 --> 10:05.325
So how'd you get
the bounty on Random?

10:05.397 --> 10:06.698
I got a Buddy
at the courthouse.

10:06.761 --> 10:08.829
Random missed his hearing,
I got a call.
Hmm.

10:08.863 --> 10:11.698
So you like this guy for murder, huh?
Yeah, for his bail bondsman-- Deon Carver.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.206
God, I know Deon. I just did
a skip trace for him last year.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.042
You know, we found a weird
piece of paper in his sock.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.060
I'm thinking
it's some kind of code.

10:20.094 --> 10:23.263
Only paper I've seen people kill
for had dead presidents on it.

10:24.404 --> 10:26.306
Look,
if Random's not your guy,

10:26.353 --> 10:28.849
can I take him over to central
booking, collect my bounty?

10:28.859 --> 10:30.407
Yeah, sure, if he alibis out,

10:30.408 --> 10:32.877
but I wouldn't
hold my breath on that.

10:32.911 --> 10:34.945
Castle, you coming?

10:34.980 --> 10:37.448
Oh, actually, I was gonna
hang back with Royce,

10:37.482 --> 10:39.450
hear some stories
about the good ol' days.

10:39.484 --> 10:41.452
Okay. Fine.

10:41.486 --> 10:43.587
But if you tell him about
the karaoke stakeout,

10:43.622 --> 10:45.623
I'm gonna tell him
what happened with the monkey.

10:45.657 --> 10:47.224
My lips are sealed.

10:48.827 --> 10:50.928
But I got
a lot of other stories.

10:50.962 --> 10:52.930
I wasn't running away.

10:52.964 --> 10:54.465
I was jogging.

10:54.499 --> 10:57.035
So what were you doing climbing
down the side of a building?

10:57.089 --> 10:59.557
Cross-training.
Better cardiovascular workout.

11:01.047 --> 11:03.549
Random, you did a stint
at Five Points Correctional

11:03.583 --> 11:04.618
and within a week
of your release,

11:04.696 --> 11:06.631
you were breaking in
to someone's apartment.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.165
That was a misunderstanding.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.134
I wrote down
my friend's address wrong.

11:10.168 --> 11:11.202
Really?

11:11.236 --> 11:13.537
So what do you call
killing Deon Carver,

11:13.572 --> 11:15.306
mistaken identity?

11:15.340 --> 11:17.274
Deon's dead?

11:17.309 --> 11:20.044
Nice try. You have a history
of breaking and entering,

11:20.864 --> 11:23.165
and I have a victim
whose offices were ransacked,

11:23.200 --> 11:25.501
and you were seen
arguing with Carver

11:25.535 --> 11:27.170
three hours
before he was killed.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.254
He invited me to dinner
'cause he wanted to stress

11:29.289 --> 11:31.091
the importance of my attendance
in court this morning.

11:31.172 --> 11:33.525
And seeing as he had 100k
on the hook if  I skipped--

11:33.535 --> 11:34.552
Which you did.

11:35.101 --> 11:36.368
My alarm clock
didn't go off.

11:36.425 --> 11:38.392
Or you were so exhausted
after killing Carver

11:38.427 --> 11:41.128
that you slept right through it.
Come on!

11:41.163 --> 11:43.164
Three hours after we had dinner,
I was shoplifting

11:43.244 --> 11:44.292
at Book Mart uptown,

11:44.302 --> 11:47.415
You threatened someone's life and then
decide to shoplift a book?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.258
That's why I forgot to pay.

11:48.353 --> 11:50.022
I was so used to being
in the prison library.

11:50.112 --> 11:52.180
I tried to tell
the security dude that,

11:52.181 --> 11:54.883
but he had me
in some ninja choke hold.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.886
Luckily for me, I was able to
slip away before the cops came.

11:57.920 --> 12:03.366
Sucker. But that guard
would totally remember me.

12:03.698 --> 12:05.999
So now she's got
the cat in one hand,

12:06.033 --> 12:08.102
her gun in the other. I'm trying
to get the hell outta the way

12:08.163 --> 12:09.913
so she can shoot the guy
with the speargun.

12:09.923 --> 12:12.823
Except Royce has such a giant
head, that every time

12:12.900 --> 12:14.801
I go to pull the trigger,
all I can think about is

12:14.837 --> 12:17.006
how much paperwork I'll have to
do if accidentally shoot him.

12:17.074 --> 12:18.308
Yeah, okay, so you know what she does?
What?

12:18.335 --> 12:21.648
She offers to show the guy her
boobs if he drops the speargun.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.508
Did he?
Did you?

12:23.522 --> 12:26.324
No, 'cause he had
the same slack-jawed look

12:26.359 --> 12:27.259
that the two of you have.

12:27.286 --> 12:29.153
Allowing me
to take the guy down,

12:29.176 --> 12:30.477
but I'll tell you what
I realized in that moment--

12:30.558 --> 12:32.459
with Beckett, you gotta
be ready for anything.

12:33.881 --> 12:36.616
Wow. I'm seeing
a whole new side of you today.

12:37.294 --> 12:38.715
And--and feel free
to show me more.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.349
Do you see what happens
when you feed the animals?

12:40.736 --> 12:42.570
Hey. So it looks like
your shoplifter

12:42.605 --> 12:44.038
isn't our killer after all.

12:44.059 --> 12:46.260
Guard at Book Mart confirms
that he caught him

12:46.354 --> 12:48.289
trying to steal a copy
of "the Da Vinci Code."

12:48.299 --> 12:49.591
"The Da Vinci Code."

12:50.243 --> 12:52.411
Maybe he thought it could
help him decipher the document,

12:52.449 --> 12:55.585
thinking it's some kind of
an ancient religious cryptogram

12:55.619 --> 12:57.087
prophesizing the coming
zombie apocalypse.

12:57.089 --> 12:58.556
He always like this?

12:58.590 --> 13:00.391
No, it's usually
about CIA conspiracies.

13:00.426 --> 13:02.360
I was really close
on one of those.

13:02.394 --> 13:04.128
So do you want us
to lock Random up?

13:04.163 --> 13:05.430
The store wants us
to hold on to him.

13:05.497 --> 13:07.431
Why don't we let Royce
take him down to central?

13:07.465 --> 13:10.034
Book Mart can press charges over there.
All right.

13:10.068 --> 13:12.436
Thanks, kid. I owe you one.
You don't owe me anything,

13:12.470 --> 13:14.171
and you know it.

13:15.429 --> 13:17.330
Hey, do me a favor.
Take a picture.

13:17.365 --> 13:19.666
Yeah, yeah, of course.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.469
Thanks. Come on.
Old time's sake.
Okay.

13:24.372 --> 13:26.740
Nice.
It was so good
to see you.

13:26.774 --> 13:29.242
You stay sharp, kid.
Mm-hmm.

13:29.277 --> 13:32.045
Rick, don't let her
boss you around too much.

13:32.079 --> 13:35.482
Hey, come on, kitten. We got
a date at central booking.

13:37.051 --> 13:39.085
He tells a terrific story.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.021
You got a little bromance
there, Castle?

13:41.055 --> 13:42.956
What? No. What?

13:42.990 --> 13:46.760
It's all right.
He is pretty hard to resist.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.647
Hey.

13:53.682 --> 13:55.015
Yeah.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.219
Why didn't, uh, Royce
and Beckett stay partners?

13:57.287 --> 13:59.188
She moved up,
and he moved out.

13:59.223 --> 14:01.591
He did his 20
and put in his papers.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.192
I think he realized

14:03.227 --> 14:06.162
that he wasn't gonna do
any better than her.

14:08.899 --> 14:10.900
I think Beckett's right
about this.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.436
This doesn't look like
anything worth killing for.

14:13.470 --> 14:16.806
Unless it's the lost secret
to the Illuminati...

14:16.840 --> 14:18.808
Or morse code.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.627
Negative.
All dashes, no dots.

14:23.084 --> 14:24.485
Hey, guys. You wanna hear
something weird?

14:24.580 --> 14:26.581
We got a fingerprint hit
from Carver's office

14:26.631 --> 14:28.899
on a longtime felon
named Clifford Stuckey.

14:30.172 --> 14:31.439
Stuckey?

14:31.473 --> 14:33.275
Why do I know that name?

14:33.371 --> 14:35.105
That's because
it was Stuckey's apartment

14:35.106 --> 14:36.642
that Random broke in to
when he got out of prison.

14:36.652 --> 14:38.155
That can't be a coincidence.

14:39.577 --> 14:41.011
Clifford Stuckey.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.348
NYPD. Open up.

14:59.411 --> 15:00.279
Who are you?

15:00.338 --> 15:02.206
Uh...
NYPD.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.908
Are you
Clifford Stuckey?

15:03.955 --> 15:05.722
Clifford Stuckey.
Yeah.

15:05.757 --> 15:07.540
We'd like you to come downtown
and answer some questions

15:07.603 --> 15:09.571
about your break-in.
You'll have to
speak up, son.

15:09.666 --> 15:12.034
I dropped my hearing aid down the toilet.
Oh, Beckett's gonna love him.

15:12.069 --> 15:13.602
What?

15:14.685 --> 15:16.786
Mr. Stuckey,
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

15:16.820 --> 15:20.156
I wish they had cops like you
when I was getting in trouble.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.091
Uh, sir, could you tell us

15:22.126 --> 15:25.228
what you were doing
in Mr. Carver's office?
Who?

15:25.914 --> 15:28.616
Deon Carver.
He was a bail bondsman.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.284
He was murdered last night.

15:30.318 --> 15:32.186
We found your fingerprints
in his office.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.488
Oh, him. Ah.

15:35.705 --> 15:36.806
What was the question?

15:36.895 --> 15:39.097
Mr. Carver posted bail
for Random Pierce,

15:39.106 --> 15:40.540
the man who broke in
to your apartment.

15:40.567 --> 15:43.268
I need to know what you were
doing in his office.

15:44.415 --> 15:47.250
Do you believe an old dog can
learn new tricks, Detective?

15:48.148 --> 15:49.449
No.

15:49.483 --> 15:51.350
Ah, neither did I.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.053
And then I got old.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.788
You see,

15:55.823 --> 15:58.891
I-I been a bad man
most of my life.

15:58.926 --> 16:01.394
And now all my friends
are dead or in jail,

16:01.428 --> 16:03.095
and I got...

16:03.130 --> 16:07.200
Nothing to show for my...
My time here.

16:11.439 --> 16:13.908
Mr. Stuckey,
Carver's office?

16:13.920 --> 16:15.087
Huh?

16:15.129 --> 16:17.297
Oh.
When the police told me that

16:17.394 --> 16:18.995
that boy
had broken into my place,

16:19.037 --> 16:22.706
well, suddenly,
I-I saw myself 40 years ago,

16:23.690 --> 16:26.092
and I thought, if somebody
had just given me a break,

16:26.122 --> 16:28.023
maybe my life woulda
turned out differently.

16:28.057 --> 16:30.325
So--so I went to see
what's his name--Carver?
Mm-hmm.

16:30.359 --> 16:32.260
And I told him that
I would consider, you know,

16:32.295 --> 16:34.629
dropping the charges
if that kid could convince me

16:34.664 --> 16:36.231
that he was, you know,

16:36.265 --> 16:38.767
willing to
straighten his life out.

16:40.236 --> 16:42.671
Where were you last night?

16:42.705 --> 16:45.508
At home asleep,
or as close as I ever get...

16:45.525 --> 16:47.193
Having to pee every half-hour.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.357
Oh, you should see the size
of my prostate, son.

16:50.346 --> 16:52.748
It's like a baby's fist.
Yeah, whoa. Thank you.

16:52.782 --> 16:54.783
Thank you, Mr. Stuckey.
That's--that's good.

16:54.817 --> 16:56.685
Oh.

16:56.719 --> 16:57.853
Whoa.

16:59.889 --> 17:02.858
Hey.

17:02.892 --> 17:05.861
Hey, that's the kid.
Any idea where I can find him?

17:05.895 --> 17:07.561
My--my offer still stands.

17:07.597 --> 17:10.031
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Stuckey.
It's too late.

17:10.066 --> 17:12.367
He's already on his way
back to jail.

17:12.401 --> 17:15.203
Aw, jeez.

17:15.238 --> 17:16.438
Huh.

17:24.117 --> 17:24.917
Call me crazy,

17:24.962 --> 17:28.364
but I don't think he was
looking at Random's picture.

17:28.398 --> 17:30.867
It was like he was
checking out that document.

17:30.901 --> 17:33.303
Oh, you mean, "the world's
least-interesting doodle"?

17:35.506 --> 17:36.973
Beckett.

17:37.007 --> 17:39.743
I was just getting ready
to cut open Carver's skull

17:39.777 --> 17:41.711
when I saw it
on his forehead.

17:41.746 --> 17:43.880
Saw what?

17:43.914 --> 17:45.348
The light has to be

17:45.382 --> 17:47.517
at the right angle
to catch the shine.

17:47.551 --> 17:49.352
The sign of the cross?

17:49.386 --> 17:51.955
I ran a test on the substance
the cross was drawn with.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.823
Don't tell me.
Yep, Holy oil.

17:53.858 --> 17:54.958
Holy oil?

17:54.995 --> 17:57.730
Looks like our killer
gave Carver last rites.

18:08.270 --> 18:10.538
Dad, go back to bed.
Breakfast is almost ready.

18:10.573 --> 18:13.007
Honey, stop cooking for
a second. I want to talk to you.

18:13.042 --> 18:15.009
You've made a decision
about the scooter?

18:16.136 --> 18:18.070
Have you ever heard
of affluenza?

18:18.104 --> 18:19.538
Uh, you mean influenza?

18:19.573 --> 18:21.807
No, affluenza.
It's a condition

18:21.842 --> 18:24.009
that affects children
who come from wealthy homes.

18:24.044 --> 18:26.879
You're making that up.
I'm not. It's on Wikipedia.

18:26.913 --> 18:29.648
Can't believe everything you read online.
I don't, but the point is,

18:29.683 --> 18:31.917
you're a great kid.

18:31.952 --> 18:34.987
I'm just afraid that...
If I just give you

18:35.021 --> 18:36.455
everything you want,

18:36.489 --> 18:39.124
it's gonna warp
your relationship with money.

18:40.259 --> 18:42.394
So you're saying no?

18:43.951 --> 18:46.552
I--no, I'm not saying that.
I'm--

18:46.587 --> 18:48.222
I'm saying... that if you--

18:48.274 --> 18:50.375
if this is
really important to you,

18:50.410 --> 18:52.944
then you need to
earn the money yourself.

18:53.012 --> 18:55.213
And by earn, I don't mean
raid your college fund.

18:55.248 --> 18:58.250
Thank you.
Why are you thanking me?

18:58.284 --> 19:01.019
Because you said yes.

19:01.087 --> 19:04.122
I did?
What are you thinking?

19:04.157 --> 19:06.758
That she would fold.
This is Alexis
we're talking about.

19:06.793 --> 19:09.327
She has never met a challenge
that she hasn't attacked

19:09.362 --> 19:11.929
like Attila the Hun.
Yeah, but it would take her so long--

19:12.344 --> 19:14.278
she'll have the money
by next week.

19:14.312 --> 19:16.214
And then you know what you're
in for? You're in for tattoos.

19:16.246 --> 19:19.481
You're in for nose rings. You're
in for--oh, who knows what?

19:20.950 --> 19:24.419
Just how wild
was your wild-child phase?

19:26.188 --> 19:27.789
You don't want to know.

19:27.823 --> 19:31.084
So I might have a lead
on our last rites killer.

19:31.193 --> 19:33.228
Our victim's financials
show he made several donations

19:33.262 --> 19:36.865
to a church in the South Bronx
run by a Father Aaron Low.

19:36.899 --> 19:38.600
Ryan's on his way
to bring him in.

19:38.688 --> 19:41.756
Hey, Beckett.
Yeah, he's here.

19:41.791 --> 19:44.659
No-hassle tassels.

19:48.006 --> 19:49.907
What was the nature
of your relationship

19:49.941 --> 19:51.909
with Deon Carver?

19:51.943 --> 19:55.546
He was a member
of my congregation...

19:55.586 --> 19:56.454
And friend.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.004
Where were you 2 nights ago
between 9:00 and 11:00?

19:59.014 --> 20:00.348
I was at the church.

20:01.043 --> 20:03.678
We had a late service,
then I went home to bed.

20:04.753 --> 20:05.254
Now I'm sorry.

20:05.284 --> 20:07.652
I have an appointment,
so if you'll excuse me--

20:07.687 --> 20:11.977
whoa! Father,
those are <i>killer</i> shoes.

20:12.064 --> 20:14.598
Unfortunately, those are
the same shoes that were worn

20:14.633 --> 20:16.000
by the man
who killed Carver,

20:16.039 --> 20:18.407
and I'm certain that if we send
those to the lab,

20:18.441 --> 20:20.742
they'll have Carver's blood
all over them.

20:20.777 --> 20:23.712
Look, Deon was dead
when I got there.

20:23.746 --> 20:25.213
Try again.

20:25.248 --> 20:27.082
Look, I swear. I found him
lying in his office.

20:27.116 --> 20:29.651
I administered last rites,
and then I dialed 9-1-1.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.887
Anonymously,
and then you ran.

20:31.921 --> 20:34.222
There was nothing more I could do.
Why were you there in the first place?

20:35.660 --> 20:37.561
Well, Deon was having
marital troubles.

20:37.595 --> 20:38.496
I was helping him
find his way.

20:38.594 --> 20:40.429
Marital troubles?

20:40.494 --> 20:43.830
Are you sure that you didn't
go there looking for this?

20:43.864 --> 20:46.299
I don't know what that is.

20:46.333 --> 20:49.017
Lying is not his strong suit.
A quality I like in a priest.

20:49.027 --> 20:50.303
I'm telling the truth.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.461
Father, you left
the scene of a crime,

20:52.495 --> 20:54.896
and a man that you describe
as a friend was murdered.

20:55.610 --> 20:57.978
If you didn't have anything
to hide, you would've stayed.

20:58.012 --> 21:00.814
Look, I was in shock. Okay?
There was so much blood.

21:00.848 --> 21:03.050
All I could think to do was escape.
Because you murdered him.

21:03.084 --> 21:05.218
No! Because...
Because of how it looked.

21:05.962 --> 21:07.929
The convicts I work with
tell me horror stories

21:07.964 --> 21:09.831
about the police,
about how they're framed.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.482
You know, when I found Deon
like that, I...

21:13.578 --> 21:15.346
I panicked.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.915
Am I ashamed? Yes.

21:17.950 --> 21:21.018
But you have to believe,
I didn't murder anybody.

21:21.053 --> 21:22.987
Father,
you'll have to forgive me,

21:23.021 --> 21:24.956
but this is
a murder investigation.

21:24.990 --> 21:27.158
And I can't base this
on faith.

21:30.274 --> 21:31.474
Hey.

21:31.509 --> 21:33.476
Hey, it looks like
you caught your killer.

21:33.511 --> 21:34.944
Yeah, maybe.

21:34.979 --> 21:36.046
So...

21:36.047 --> 21:38.648
Was he trying to start
the zombie apocalypse?

21:38.683 --> 21:40.116
Mock all you want.

21:40.151 --> 21:42.886
Our good father <i>knows</i>
what that paper is.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.155
Oh, man. Hey. I found
this picture in my closet.

21:45.189 --> 21:47.657
I thought you'd get
a kick out of it.

21:47.692 --> 21:50.694
Oh, look at you!
All shiny and bright.

21:50.728 --> 21:53.863
What did I tell you
about feeding the animals?

21:53.898 --> 21:55.865
Listen,
I just stopped by

21:55.900 --> 21:57.801
to say thanks again
for the bounty assist

21:57.835 --> 22:00.036
and, uh, thought maybe
I could buy you lunch.

22:00.104 --> 22:01.838
Yeah, sure.

22:01.872 --> 22:04.774
So it looks like the bug
from Carver's office was shipped

22:04.809 --> 22:07.377
from Thailand to a, uh,
spy shop on Fifth Avenue.

22:08.054 --> 22:09.488
Guess who bought it.

22:09.522 --> 22:11.090
Father Aaron.

22:11.124 --> 22:14.059
Brooke Carver,
our victim's wife.

22:14.094 --> 22:15.728
Funny. She failed to mention

22:15.762 --> 22:17.059
that she was bugging
her husband's office.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.106
And perhaps the good father

22:18.107 --> 22:20.661
was telling the truth about
Carver's marital problems.

22:20.741 --> 22:22.576
Nothing says
"marriage on the rocks"

22:22.610 --> 22:25.011
like electronic eavesdropping.
But does it say "murder"?

22:25.046 --> 22:26.913
Let's ask her.

22:29.351 --> 22:32.052
Oh, uh, why don't you
stop by after my shift?

22:32.087 --> 22:33.887
I'll buy you a beer.

22:33.922 --> 22:35.356
It's a date.

22:38.159 --> 22:40.361
We've been fighting
all the time.

22:40.395 --> 22:43.030
Some nights,
he wouldn't come home...

22:43.064 --> 22:44.999
And he said he was
sleeping at the office,

22:45.033 --> 22:47.134
but I didn't believe him.

22:47.168 --> 22:49.837
So I bought the bug.

22:49.871 --> 22:52.906
You thought he was cheating on you.
And when you heard him in action,

22:52.941 --> 22:54.070
you decided to make yourself a widow.

22:54.161 --> 22:55.625
No, at first, I couldn't even
bear to listen.

22:55.761 --> 22:57.662
I couldn't bear to hear him
with another woman.

22:57.730 --> 22:59.631
And finally, I made
my sister listen with me,

22:59.642 --> 23:02.510
but what we heard...
It wasn't sex.

23:04.292 --> 23:07.161
It was Deon talking about
how much he loved me

23:07.195 --> 23:11.098
and how he prayed that
he could save our marriage.

23:11.133 --> 23:12.867
I cried all night.

23:12.901 --> 23:15.603
And in the morning,
I threw the receiver away.

23:15.637 --> 23:17.805
And when was that?
A few weeks ago.

23:17.839 --> 23:20.307
We had just started to find
our way back to each other,

23:20.342 --> 23:22.076
and now he's dead.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.912
Soon all I'll have to remember
him by is a box of ashes.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.782
Brooke's sister
confirms her story.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.201
We got about a dozen witnesses
that put Father Aaron

23:30.283 --> 23:32.760
in church at 10:00 P.M.
when Carver was killed.

23:32.770 --> 23:33.961
So we're back to square one.

23:34.057 --> 23:37.174
No, the answer is right here
in front of us. I can feel it.

23:37.175 --> 23:38.976
It's just that there's something
that we're not seeing.

23:39.037 --> 23:40.812
There's a connection
that we haven't made yet.

23:40.882 --> 23:42.699
Do you want me to start
processing the good father out?

23:42.870 --> 23:44.261
No, he might have an alibi,

23:44.330 --> 23:46.231
but he's definitely
involved somehow.

23:47.334 --> 23:49.469
It says here
that Father Aaron volunteers

23:49.503 --> 23:52.171
at Five Points Correctional.
That's where Random did his time.

23:52.206 --> 23:55.041
They knew each other.
And they both knew our victim.

23:55.075 --> 23:56.777
So maybe Five Points
is our connection.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.138
Did Stuckey do time there?
Nope.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.974
Doesn't me they're not
connected in a different way.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.443
Prison's a networking
gold mine for criminals.

24:04.478 --> 24:07.279
Out of curiosity,
who was Random's cell mate?

24:07.314 --> 24:09.281
Uh...

24:12.401 --> 24:14.368
Uh, Malcolm Lloyd,

24:14.403 --> 24:17.004
a recidivist thief
doing 20 for a jewel heist.

24:17.786 --> 24:18.954
We should go talk to him.

24:19.027 --> 24:21.495
Can't. Looks like he died
of a heart attack in prison

24:21.530 --> 24:23.964
three weeks ago.
Wouldn't it be funny

24:24.032 --> 24:27.768
if Father Aaron administered
last rites for Lloyd as well?

24:30.115 --> 24:30.615
Ryan.

24:30.619 --> 24:32.387
Yeah.
Check Lloyd's known associates.

24:32.421 --> 24:34.889
Dot mention the priest.
Wait a minute.

24:34.924 --> 24:36.925
It says Lloyd
knew Clifford Stuckey.

24:36.959 --> 24:38.426
Looks like he and Lloyd

24:38.460 --> 24:40.361
were both arrested
for the same jewel heist.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.996
They were partners.

24:42.031 --> 24:44.899
D.A. didn't have enough evidence
to prosecute Stuckey,

24:44.934 --> 24:47.101
so he walked
while Lloyd did 20 years.

24:47.136 --> 24:48.703
That still doesn't explain

24:48.737 --> 24:50.709
why Random broke in
to Stuckey's apartment.

24:50.719 --> 24:51.768
Maybe this will help

24:51.769 --> 24:53.770
the heist that Lloyd
and Stuckey pulled--

24:53.818 --> 24:56.720
$10 million in rare sapphires
and rubies--and guess what.

24:57.780 --> 25:00.915
They were never found.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.984
You guys...

25:03.018 --> 25:07.088
I think I know
what this is.

25:07.122 --> 25:09.223
It's a treasure map.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.251
Father,
we checked with the prison.

25:18.329 --> 25:20.797
We know that you gave
Malcolm Lloyd his last rites.

25:20.832 --> 25:22.966
That's when you found out
about the map.

25:24.915 --> 25:27.117
I ministered to Malcolm
at the end.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.719
He told me he was scared,
that...

25:29.754 --> 25:32.322
He wanted to do one good thing
before he died.

25:32.356 --> 25:35.525
He made me promise that
I would use it for the church.

25:35.559 --> 25:39.062
But when I went to the cell,
um, the map wasn't there.

25:39.096 --> 25:41.464
Because Random
had already taken it.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.534
But when Random got out of jail,
he couldn't figure it out.

25:43.578 --> 25:45.579
So he breaks in to Stuckey's
apartment, figuring he's gonna

25:45.613 --> 25:47.547
strong-arm Lloyd's old partner
into helping him.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.773
Only Stuckey wasn't home,
and someone called the cops.
I called them.

25:50.808 --> 25:53.209
I had been following Random.
I knew that his arrest would

25:53.244 --> 25:55.612
give me the leverage I needed
to force him to share the map.

25:57.167 --> 25:59.402
Because you were friends
with the bail bondsman.

25:59.469 --> 26:01.837
Look, Random had no money
for bail.

26:01.872 --> 26:04.673
Deon agreed to cover it
for a third of the treasure,

26:04.708 --> 26:08.077
but he insisted on holding on
to the map for safekeeping.

26:08.111 --> 26:09.979
So why were you really
at Carver's office

26:10.013 --> 26:11.381
the night he died?

26:11.399 --> 26:14.034
Deon called me and told me
he'd figured out the map..

26:14.965 --> 26:16.865
But when I got there,
he was already dead,

26:16.900 --> 26:18.634
murdered by that old man.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.046
Stuckey.
How do you know?

26:21.111 --> 26:23.045
Because Stuckey had caught
Deon and Random

26:23.079 --> 26:24.847
conspiring together
the night before.

26:25.896 --> 26:28.598
He told them he had waited
20 years for that money,

26:28.629 --> 26:30.364
and they had 24 hours
to give it back,

26:30.394 --> 26:32.194
or bodies
were gonna start dropping.

26:35.797 --> 26:37.698
Mr. Stuckey.

26:37.732 --> 26:40.234
We need to talk.

26:55.016 --> 26:57.718
Ow!

26:58.345 --> 27:00.813
We're never gonna hear the end of this.
Aw, crap.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.773
When do Esposito and Ryan
get back?

27:05.808 --> 27:07.942
Soon. They're on their way
to central booking

27:07.976 --> 27:10.378
to pick up Random
to ask him about the map.

27:10.412 --> 27:11.613
So I made
a couple of phone calls,

27:11.695 --> 27:15.298
and this heist in 1990
was worth $10 million,

27:15.332 --> 27:17.467
and now it's worth
almost $30 million.

27:17.501 --> 27:19.436
Hey, you ready?
Yeah.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.137
Uh, w--

27:21.172 --> 27:24.040
uh, what?
You can't leave now.
Come on, Castle.

27:24.074 --> 27:26.009
Every uniform in the city's
got Stuckey's photo.

27:26.043 --> 27:28.478
And if there's one thing
that my T.O. taught me,

27:28.563 --> 27:31.265
it's that sometimes
the best way to crack a case

27:31.299 --> 27:33.267
is by taking a break.

27:33.301 --> 27:35.770
Promise I won't
keep her out too late.

27:40.844 --> 27:42.779
So... it's...

27:42.813 --> 27:45.248
Actually a treasure map,
huh?

27:45.282 --> 27:48.117
Castle's been trying
to figure it out all day.

27:48.152 --> 27:49.452
Hmm.

27:49.486 --> 27:51.921
I should've been on
to Stuckey earlier, though.

27:51.955 --> 27:54.891
Nobody's perfect.
You were.

27:54.925 --> 27:57.093
Mm-hmm.
You were easy to impress.

27:57.127 --> 27:58.528
No, I wasn't.

27:58.562 --> 28:01.164
I was drowning, and...

28:02.093 --> 28:03.627
You were dry land.

28:04.957 --> 28:05.725
All they ever taught us

28:05.753 --> 28:07.620
in the academy
was how to do paperwork.

28:07.655 --> 28:10.190
You were the one who taught me
how to be a cop.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.322
You were easy to teach.

28:13.501 --> 28:15.969
Keeping you outta trouble?
Mm. Not so much.

28:16.003 --> 28:19.406
Oh, trouble? Me?
What about that biker chick from Yonkers?

28:19.417 --> 28:21.501
Yeah, well, I got her to snitch
on her crew, didn't I?

28:21.511 --> 28:23.320
By offering me up
as man bait.

28:23.485 --> 28:26.253
Oh, you shoulda seen your face
when she told the judge,

28:26.288 --> 28:28.456
"he completes me."
That's mean.

28:30.425 --> 28:32.693
Nah, that's...

28:32.728 --> 28:35.362
♪ I got a muse
from the East to the West ♪

28:35.397 --> 28:36.997
♪ all I know is if ♪

28:37.032 --> 28:39.200
I caught him, Royce.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.502
♪ I never said it before ♪

28:41.536 --> 28:43.571
The man who killed my mom.

28:45.705 --> 28:48.240
After all these years?

28:50.407 --> 28:52.475
You find out
why he did it?

28:54.678 --> 28:56.979
Somebody paid him
to do it.

28:57.014 --> 28:59.882
But I had to shoot him
before I could find out who.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.420
That was stupid.

29:06.223 --> 29:09.425
You shoulda
just shown him your boobs.

29:22.272 --> 29:23.873
Dad?

29:23.907 --> 29:25.308
Hey.

29:25.342 --> 29:26.809
What are you doing here?

29:26.877 --> 29:28.311
I got the money.

29:28.345 --> 29:30.079
Already?

29:30.114 --> 29:31.781
Mm-hmm.
How?

29:31.815 --> 29:33.716
The lightsabers.
I found a guy on eBay

29:33.751 --> 29:35.343
willing to pay 2 grand for them.

29:35.353 --> 29:36.835
But we had so much fun
with those.

29:36.836 --> 29:39.604
We were saving the universe
one galaxy at a time.

29:39.738 --> 29:40.873
That's what got you
into fencing.

29:40.958 --> 29:43.226
I know, dad,
but I've outgrown them.

29:46.094 --> 29:48.262
No, I-I guess...

29:48.327 --> 29:50.028
I guess you have.

29:50.062 --> 29:52.263
Are you mad?

29:52.297 --> 29:53.765
No. No.

29:53.799 --> 29:55.700
I--I'm frustrated

29:55.734 --> 29:58.102
over this case.

29:58.137 --> 29:59.737
Is that the map?

29:59.772 --> 30:03.741
Yeah, and it's making me
doubt my own genius.

30:03.776 --> 30:06.244
There's just something
I am not seeing.

30:06.278 --> 30:07.779
Can I take a look?

30:07.846 --> 30:09.313
Sure.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.252
We found it
folded up in our victim's sock.

30:13.258 --> 30:16.061
It's got a lot of fold marks on it...
Yeah.

30:16.146 --> 30:18.114
Almost like a puzzle...
Mm-hmm.

30:18.148 --> 30:20.249
Or one of those
paper fortune-tellers.

30:20.284 --> 30:22.084
Or "Mad" magazine.

30:23.954 --> 30:25.421
Uh...

30:25.455 --> 30:28.124
"Mad" magazine used to have
is trick picture on the back.

30:29.305 --> 30:30.439
If you folded it
the right way,

30:30.533 --> 30:32.367
it would show you
an entirely different image.

30:32.401 --> 30:34.703
Hey, there's--
there's a word there.

30:34.737 --> 30:36.938
"The."

30:42.144 --> 30:43.611
"Under."

30:43.646 --> 30:45.180
Under.
"Under the..."

30:46.916 --> 30:48.283
"Gun."

30:48.317 --> 30:49.984
"Under the Gun."

30:50.019 --> 30:51.686
"Under the Gun."
"Under the Gun."

30:51.721 --> 30:53.922
What d--
what does at mean?

30:53.956 --> 30:55.557
I don't know.

30:56.425 --> 30:57.159
I should get going.

30:57.235 --> 30:59.670
They're gonna be bringing
Random into the precinct.

31:00.684 --> 31:03.152
I'm just gonna hit the head.

31:07.391 --> 31:09.525
♪

31:12.796 --> 31:14.397
Beckett.

31:14.431 --> 31:16.399
It's Ryan.
We're at central booking.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.768
Random isn't here.

31:18.802 --> 31:20.770
What do you mean,
he's not there?

31:20.804 --> 31:21.372
Where is he?

31:21.464 --> 31:24.399
I don't know. Your Buddy Royce
never delivered him.

31:44.443 --> 31:46.745
I can't believe
he lied to me.

31:46.843 --> 31:49.645
Money makes people
do crazy things.

31:49.679 --> 31:51.580
Look at any
reality show contestant

31:51.615 --> 31:53.649
who ever ate a cockroach
on television.

31:53.683 --> 31:55.584
Doesn't mean
he killed Carver.

31:55.619 --> 31:57.520
Yeah, well,
until I find otherwise,

31:57.554 --> 31:59.622
I'm gonna have to assume
that he did.

31:59.656 --> 32:02.458
Do you think he came here to see
the map like Stuckey did?

32:02.492 --> 32:04.326
No. Oh, no.

32:04.361 --> 32:05.928
What?

32:05.962 --> 32:08.597
When I took the picture
of the two of you,

32:08.632 --> 32:10.502
you were standing
in front of the murder board.

32:11.312 --> 32:13.211
He has a copy of the map.

32:13.370 --> 32:15.405
Yes, but obviously,
he can't figure it out.

32:15.461 --> 32:17.895
That's why he was here.
He wanted to see if we did.

32:17.905 --> 32:19.725
Yo, Beckett.

32:18.965 --> 32:20.933
I pulled the files
from the jewelry heist.

32:20.967 --> 32:23.068
Your boy Royce was part
of the investigation.

32:23.102 --> 32:25.437
So he knew about
the treasure from the start.

32:25.471 --> 32:27.673
We have surveillance
on his apartment,

32:27.707 --> 32:28.646
and an A.P.B. out on his car.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.865
What about "Under the Gun"?
Any idea what that means?

32:30.866 --> 32:33.412
No, not yet. There was
a gun club about five blocks

32:33.446 --> 32:35.814
from the jewel heist,
but it was torn down

32:35.848 --> 32:37.749
and turned into condominiums
about ten years ago.

32:37.784 --> 32:39.585
All right, then.
Keep looking.

32:44.183 --> 32:45.617
Beckett.

32:45.651 --> 32:47.953
It's me.

32:49.322 --> 32:51.823
Royce,
turn yourself in.

32:51.857 --> 32:53.291
I can't do that, kid.

32:53.326 --> 32:55.660
I'm too close to the money
to walk away right now.

32:55.695 --> 32:58.797
Listen, I just...
Need you to know that I...

32:58.831 --> 33:02.267
Didn't mean
for it to go like this.

33:02.301 --> 33:04.035
Did you kill Carver
for the map?

33:04.070 --> 33:06.905
Oh, come on, kid.
You know me better than that.

33:06.939 --> 33:09.307
I don't think I do,

33:09.342 --> 33:12.477
because the man that I knew
wouldn't betray me like this.

33:13.496 --> 33:14.897
I gotta go. I--

33:14.931 --> 33:16.632
Mike...

33:16.666 --> 33:18.734
I was in love with you.

33:18.768 --> 33:20.202
Oh, Kate, don't.

33:20.236 --> 33:22.137
You were the only one

33:22.172 --> 33:25.074
who understood the obsession
that drove me...

33:25.108 --> 33:27.977
Who didn't tell me that I would
get over my mother's murder

33:28.011 --> 33:30.412
and that she wouldn't
want me to do this.

33:30.447 --> 33:32.848
Just... just trying
to do right by you, kid.

33:32.916 --> 33:34.817
I dreamt about you.

33:34.851 --> 33:37.753
The night that I shot the guy
who killed my mother,

33:37.787 --> 33:41.323
I dreamt that I was the one
who was on the ground dying,

33:41.358 --> 33:45.094
and that you came up to me
and told me to stand up

33:45.128 --> 33:47.029
'cause there was still work
to be done.

33:47.063 --> 33:50.199
When I woke up that morning,
I just wanted to call you,

33:50.233 --> 33:52.901
but we hadn't talked
in so long.

33:52.936 --> 33:54.770
You shoulda called.

33:54.804 --> 33:56.638
I never forgot.

33:58.181 --> 34:01.617
I'm going
to catch Carver's killer, Royce.

34:01.651 --> 34:04.653
And then I'm going to recover
Lloyd's score.

34:04.687 --> 34:06.588
And when I arrest you,

34:06.623 --> 34:09.024
you're gonna realize
that what you destroyed today

34:09.058 --> 34:12.761
was worth a hell of a lot more
than money.

34:16.462 --> 34:19.230
Did I keep him on
long enough?

34:19.264 --> 34:20.733
Uh... um...

34:20.739 --> 34:22.975
Yeah. We got an address.

34:23.009 --> 34:25.210
All right. Let's go.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.648
Wh--all--all that was just
an act to get a trace?

34:29.681 --> 34:32.217
Of course.

34:33.228 --> 34:35.128
Oh.

34:39.801 --> 34:41.268
NYPD!

34:42.737 --> 34:44.572
Whoo. Thank God.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.516
That dude totally kidnapped me.
Clear.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.819
Knock it off. We already know
about the map.
Really?

34:48.853 --> 34:50.955
Where's Royce?
Out lookin' for my money.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.857
Looks like
he betrayed all of us.

34:53.891 --> 34:56.092
Random, either you start
telling us the truth,

34:56.127 --> 34:59.029
or Esposito is gonna hang you
out that window by your feet.

34:59.064 --> 35:00.664
Look,
I'm a victim in all this.

35:00.699 --> 35:01.733
I bunked with a geezer
who wouldn't shut up

35:01.821 --> 35:03.622
about his $10-million score,
how he'd buried it

35:03.656 --> 35:05.858
where nobody could find it,
not without the map.

35:05.892 --> 35:08.026
But then I had to partner with
Carver and the creepy priest,

35:09.127 --> 35:11.061
and instead of us trying
to figure out the map,

35:11.095 --> 35:13.964
all they wanted to do was argue
about how unchristian it was

35:13.998 --> 35:15.933
to cut Carver's wife
out of the score.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.902
This argument, did it
take place in Carver's office?
Yeah.

35:19.677 --> 35:21.210
Which Brooke had bugged.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.579
Seriously?
Call Ryan, have him find Brooke.

35:23.614 --> 35:24.914
Right.

35:24.948 --> 35:27.050
She didn't hear him profess
his undying love for her.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.152
She heard him trying to
cut her out of millions.

35:29.186 --> 35:31.187
And then she lied
to our faces.

35:31.221 --> 35:33.723
Marriage on the rocks,
a fortune in rocks--

35:33.757 --> 35:35.658
two strong motives
for murder.

35:35.693 --> 35:37.894
We showed her the map.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.567
Well, no wonder her hands
were trembling.

35:39.944 --> 35:42.645
Ryan traced Brooke to Carver's office.
All right. Let's go.

35:44.147 --> 35:46.548
Hey, hey, hey.

35:46.583 --> 35:48.517
What about me?

35:48.551 --> 35:50.986
Have a cheese puff.
Uniforms are on their way.

35:51.020 --> 35:53.622
There's no one here.

35:53.656 --> 35:55.123
We just missed her.

35:55.158 --> 35:57.593
She was trying to recreate
the map from memory.

35:57.627 --> 35:59.595
Look at this.
Notes she took

35:59.629 --> 36:02.030
while she was listening in
on the bug.

36:02.065 --> 36:03.799
Right here--"Under the Gun."

36:03.808 --> 36:05.709
She heard them
figure it out,

36:05.743 --> 36:07.911
but without the map,
she can't find the treasure.

36:07.945 --> 36:09.846
That's because the score
could be buried anywhere.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.815
No, it can't be.

36:11.849 --> 36:13.950
New York is basically
an island of concrete.

36:15.114 --> 36:16.782
Lloyd would have to make sure
he buried it someplace

36:16.881 --> 36:19.082
that couldn't be torn down
or dug up to make condos.

36:19.117 --> 36:21.551
The park maybe.
Or a cemetery.

36:21.586 --> 36:23.494
Didn't Brooke say Carver
was being cremated?

36:23.794 --> 36:25.895
So why does she have
cemetery brochures?

36:26.474 --> 36:28.375
Those weren't lines
on the map.

36:28.410 --> 36:29.910
Those were gravestones.

36:29.945 --> 36:32.112
Want to bet it's buried
Under the Gun?

36:32.147 --> 36:34.081
You know, if this were a horror movie,

36:34.115 --> 36:36.150
we'd be the first ones killed,
splitting off like this.

36:36.184 --> 36:38.886
Yeah, except we're not
a couple of top-heavy coeds

36:38.920 --> 36:40.387
out looking for fun.

36:40.422 --> 36:42.389
We're highly trained
officers of the law

36:42.424 --> 36:45.359
with enough firepower
to take out a horde of undead.

36:45.393 --> 36:48.229
Hispanic and cocky. Yeah,
you definitely die first.

36:49.854 --> 36:51.788
You know, if this was
a horror movie--

36:51.823 --> 36:53.857
Castle, focus.

36:53.891 --> 36:56.359
Ha! There it is.
There it is. Look.

36:56.394 --> 36:57.527
Ok.

36:57.562 --> 36:59.062
Yes!

36:59.096 --> 37:00.822
Looks like
someone's been here already.

37:01.059 --> 37:03.265
Drop the gun.

37:03.266 --> 37:05.300
I can't do that.
Then we got a problem.

37:05.334 --> 37:06.469
You're not a cop killer,
Brooke.

37:06.507 --> 37:08.407
I know you didn't mean
to kill Deon.

37:08.442 --> 37:10.409
He just surprised you when you
were looking for that map.

37:10.444 --> 37:12.411
To hell with that.
Of course I meant to kill him.

37:12.446 --> 37:14.180
After ten years
of putting up with

37:14.214 --> 37:16.616
his foot fetish and snoring,
he betrays me like that?

37:16.650 --> 37:18.918
Unh-unh.
I deserve that treasure,

37:18.952 --> 37:21.787
and I'm not leaving here
without it.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.823
The only one leaving with
that treasure is me.

37:23.857 --> 37:25.725
And I got the biggest gun.
Not anymore, grandpa.

37:25.759 --> 37:27.827
NYPD! Drop your weapon
right now!
Drop it! NYPD!

37:27.861 --> 37:31.130
Drop it, stupid.
What's wrong with you?
Drop your weapon
right now! Drop it now!

37:38.998 --> 37:40.033
What about you, Royce?

37:40.065 --> 37:41.781
You willing to shoot me
for that treasure?

37:41.791 --> 37:42.846
In case
you haven't noticed, kid,

37:42.935 --> 37:44.716
my gun's not pointed at you.

37:44.726 --> 37:46.915
Well, my gun is,
and at this range,

37:47.068 --> 37:49.035
I'm gonna turn her
and the haircut into soup.

37:49.070 --> 37:50.737
You shoot, you die, gramps.

37:50.771 --> 37:53.540
You think I care? The only thing
that's keeping me alive

37:53.574 --> 37:56.142
is that $10 million in stones.
Either I leave with it,

37:56.177 --> 37:57.796
or I leave in a body bag.

37:57.806 --> 37:59.206
Well, then maybe
we should make sure

37:59.273 --> 38:01.107
that treasure's even there
before we start shooting.

38:02.550 --> 38:04.385
Castle, do you mind?

38:04.419 --> 38:05.354
Why me?

38:05.428 --> 38:07.262
Because you're the only one
without a gun.

38:08.725 --> 38:11.093
Good point. Okay.

38:11.128 --> 38:12.762
Just, uh...

38:23.407 --> 38:25.308
You got a plan he, kid?

38:25.342 --> 38:27.610
Not one that I'm gonna
share with you.

38:27.644 --> 38:29.946
Maybe you should
show us all something.

38:32.816 --> 38:33.916
Hey.

38:33.951 --> 38:35.718
Hey, guys.

38:35.752 --> 38:38.221
I think I found something.

38:42.092 --> 38:44.060
Just like old times,
huh, kid?

38:44.094 --> 38:47.430
Drop the gun. <i>Now.</i>

38:49.266 --> 38:51.801
The treasure.
Let me see the treasure.

38:52.753 --> 38:55.822
Yeah, I j--I just said that
to distract you.

38:55.856 --> 38:58.291
It was either that
or show 'em my boobs.

38:59.994 --> 39:01.361
You got Royce?

39:01.395 --> 39:02.495
Yeah.

39:02.530 --> 39:05.198
Get up. <i>Get up.</i>
Ryan.

39:05.232 --> 39:06.933
Yeah. All right,
come on.

39:06.967 --> 39:08.935
On your feet.
Let's go. You got him? Move.

39:08.969 --> 39:10.937
Yeah.

39:10.971 --> 39:12.906
...Right to remain silent...

39:12.940 --> 39:14.808
Not running now, are you?

39:14.842 --> 39:17.310
Huh? Where's your Walker?
...Used against you
in a court of law.

39:17.344 --> 39:20.046
You have the right
to an attorney...

39:20.080 --> 39:22.715
Go ahead, kid.

39:22.750 --> 39:25.752
Do what you gotta do.

39:34.766 --> 39:37.968
Michael Royce,
you're under arrest.

39:46.478 --> 39:48.579
Uh...

39:48.613 --> 39:50.581
Hello?

39:50.615 --> 39:54.051
Doesn't anyone want to see if
there actually is a treasure?!

39:54.085 --> 39:56.353
I can't believe there wasn't
actually a treasure.

39:56.388 --> 39:58.322
Maybe we read the map wrong.

39:58.356 --> 40:00.324
Maybe it was all
a wild goose chase.

40:00.358 --> 40:01.992
Either way,
case is closed.

40:02.027 --> 40:03.794
Hey, how's Beckett
holding up?

40:03.828 --> 40:06.764
Hard to see
your heroes fall.

40:08.733 --> 40:10.668
Hey.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.303
Hey.

40:14.416 --> 40:15.751
Can I just say

40:15.814 --> 40:18.449
how... unsatisfying it is

40:18.483 --> 40:20.585
to go on a treasure hunt
with no treasure?

40:20.594 --> 40:22.494
Well, it wasn't really
a treasure hunt, Castle.

40:22.529 --> 40:24.463
It was
a murder investigation.

40:24.497 --> 40:26.398
Oh, come on.
You can't tell me

40:26.433 --> 40:28.367
you weren't
just a little bit excited.

40:29.035 --> 40:29.770
Maybe a little.

40:29.779 --> 40:31.046
Mm.

40:32.751 --> 40:34.452
What's bugging me,
though, is,

40:34.486 --> 40:37.689
if there was no treasure,
then why make a map?

40:37.695 --> 40:40.597
Well, it's a big cemetery.
Maybe he got the spot wrong.

40:40.631 --> 40:43.467
Or maybe "Under the Gun"
was just to throw us off.

40:43.501 --> 40:45.435
You know, if it was me,

40:45.470 --> 40:48.372
I would've left something out
of the map, last step.

40:48.406 --> 40:50.307
So you think
there was another map?

40:50.341 --> 40:52.743
No, I would've kept it
somewhere close to me,

40:52.777 --> 40:55.178
somewhere where--
where only I knew that--

40:55.213 --> 40:57.114
that it was important.

40:57.148 --> 41:00.298
Somewhere
like on my body.

41:00.638 --> 41:02.139
Do you think this is
the final part of the map?

41:02.455 --> 41:03.389
What else
would be important enough

41:03.424 --> 41:05.225
for our jewel thief
to tattoo it on his arm?

41:05.393 --> 41:08.497
Okay, uh, Roman numerals--
II over a VI.

41:08.689 --> 41:10.923
I'm gonna say that that means
two rows up,

41:10.957 --> 41:13.159
six stones over
from where we dug.

41:14.038 --> 41:14.872
You...

41:14.892 --> 41:17.327
Care to do some digging,
Detective?

41:25.909 --> 41:28.443
Well, did you find it?

41:28.478 --> 41:30.479
Yes, we did!

41:30.513 --> 41:31.513
Yay!

41:31.548 --> 41:33.715
Yes.
Unfortunately,

41:33.750 --> 41:35.384
when you go treasure hunting
with a cop,

41:35.436 --> 41:36.041
she makes you

41:36.116 --> 41:37.805
return the treasure
to its rightful owner.

41:38.118 --> 41:40.619
But, uh, well, the evening
wasn't a total loss.

41:40.653 --> 41:43.489
When we found it, she did
give me a sweaty hug.
Dad.

41:43.523 --> 41:45.791
So what are you girls doing?

41:45.825 --> 41:48.761
You picking out a color
for your shiny new scooter?
Tell him.

41:48.795 --> 41:50.996
Tell me what?

41:54.303 --> 41:56.771
I decided
not to get the scooter.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.506
I realized
once I left the precinct

41:58.550 --> 42:00.942
how wrong it was for me
to sell those lightsabers.

42:01.021 --> 42:02.516
But I was so caught up
in wanting the bike

42:02.677 --> 42:04.111
that I convinced myself

42:04.146 --> 42:06.013
I was just trading
one thing for another.

42:06.048 --> 42:07.481
But playing pretend with you

42:07.516 --> 42:09.917
was one of the best parts
of my childhood,

42:09.985 --> 42:13.220
and it means more to me than
a shiny new scooter ever could.

42:15.996 --> 42:18.664
I'm so proud of you.

42:18.698 --> 42:21.333
Proud enough
to buy me a new scooter?

42:21.368 --> 42:22.668
No.

42:22.702 --> 42:25.971
I made a deal, and it would
be wrong to break it.

42:26.006 --> 42:28.507
But there's nothing
in that deal

42:28.542 --> 42:31.010
that prohibits me
from buying myself a scooter

42:31.044 --> 42:32.758
and maybe letting you
borrow it from time to time.

42:32.768 --> 42:33.920
Are you sure?

42:34.020 --> 42:35.288
Sure. I can send you
to the store

42:35.373 --> 42:37.507
for batteries for the lightsabers.
Thanks, dad.

42:38.042 --> 42:39.277
Oh, and when you have
the scooter,

42:39.349 --> 42:41.951
maybe I can borrow the car.
