-[manjit] hello!

01:08.735 --> 01:09.902
Hi!

01:10.504 --> 01:13.172
My name is chase van buuren;
I'm from kelowna, bc;

01:13.240 --> 01:16.308
And I'm here seeking $1 million
for 15% of my company.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.344
-[wes and manjit] wow.
-Whoa!

01:19.346 --> 01:20.846
[chase] snowmobiling and quading
is actually one

01:20.914 --> 01:23.982
Of the fastest-growing sports in
canada, so covid has only helped

01:24.050 --> 01:26.985
To accelerate that growth, so
we've developed snow--well,

01:28.322 --> 01:30.789
Mainly a snowmobile deck that
fits in the back of your

01:30.791 --> 01:31.957
Pickup truck.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.195
It extends to a full eight feet
wide for all your toys.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.764
[whirring]

01:39.432 --> 01:42.734
[chase] so I'd like to introduce
to you my latest product that is

01:42.802 --> 01:44.870
Actually more universal for your
everyday truck owner.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.674
Myself and my team have
developed the toughest tonneau

01:49.743 --> 01:52.077
Cover that you can possibly fit
onto your truck bed.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.948
As we have set up right there is
a thousand-pound concrete block

01:57.017 --> 01:59.818
That, michele, you actually have
a button to...

01:59.887 --> 02:01.085
[wes] michele].

02:01.155 --> 02:03.555
[chase]...And we are gonna
release that block onto the bed

02:03.624 --> 02:05.457
Of that truck, just to show how
tough it really is.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.359
Oh my gosh.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.996
Here we go, dragons, in five--

02:11.064 --> 02:13.966
[everyone] four, three, two,
one!

02:16.002 --> 02:17.168
-[dragons] oh!
-Wow!

02:18.972 --> 02:21.540
[chase] so with that tonneau
cover, you actually have a ramp

02:21.608 --> 02:24.776
Set up, so you can park your
quad on top and all your camping

02:24.845 --> 02:27.279
And fishing gear or hunting gear
underneath.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.580
-[arlene] wow.
-[manjit] hmm.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.116
Wow, so you can drive your quad
up onto your truck?

02:31.184 --> 02:32.250
[chase] yeah.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.451
But I'm still not
understanding--like,

02:33.454 --> 02:35.220
I don't understand the
difference between the two.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.390
So this one you can put two atvs
on.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.225
That one does not have
extendible sides,

02:40.293 --> 02:41.860
So you can only fit one on it.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.061
How much do those cost?

02:43.130 --> 02:46.198
The customer's price is $2,495
for that tonneau cover

02:46.266 --> 02:48.567
And $5,795 for the slide deck.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.004
What's your gross and your net
profits on each of the products?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.973
My margins are actually the most
impressive of all.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.275
Okay, tell us.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.143
[chase] so, with me doing all
the in-house manufacturing,

02:58.212 --> 03:01.213
This product last year was
$2,200 for me to make.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.481
What about that one?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.684
[chase] that tonneau cover cost
me $490.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.620
-[arlene] wow.
-75% margin.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.023
So where do you make these?

03:11.091 --> 03:13.025
I actually built my own
manufacturing facility

03:13.093 --> 03:14.259
In kelowna.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.960
-Oh, you did?
-[michele] no way.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.896
[chase] me and my parents,
we bought 30 acres together...

03:17.964 --> 03:19.898
-Yeah.
-...About nine years ago.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.234
My parents, obviously, the
majority of it.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.603
So we actually built a 4,500
square foot shop.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.307
Over time, I've been able to
acquire all the manufacturing

03:28.375 --> 03:30.776
Equipment to build every single
piece in-house.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.947
[vincenzo] is the property, is
it part of the deal?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.816
No, it is not.

03:38.818 --> 03:40.852
Chase, I'm dying to ask what
your sales are.

03:40.921 --> 03:45.156
In the last year, I by myself
built 200 units...

03:45.225 --> 03:46.391
Whoa.

03:46.459 --> 03:47.693
...Totally just over a million
dollars in sales last year.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.429
What are you projecting for next
year with this new product?

03:52.065 --> 03:55.600
[chase] I have enough aluminum
to produce 1,000 tonneau covers

03:55.603 --> 03:57.102
And 300 more decks this year.

03:57.837 --> 03:58.903
-But dollar-wise, what is that?
-[wes] how much money?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.606
So $2.5 million.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.408
$2.5 million in sales in that
product.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.811
And then you said another 300,
so you've got another--

04:06.814 --> 04:08.546
$1.6 million.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.749
So about $4.1 million in sales
next year projected?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.517
Correct.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.921
How much of that that you're
gonna have in the bank?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.824
I think we will definitely bank
over half of it.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.793
So you think you're gonna make
$2 million of profit?

04:21.861 --> 04:23.695
-Correct.
-Wow.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.963
[arlene] so why are you here?

04:24.965 --> 04:28.967
Right now, I do not have enough
capital to be able to meet

04:29.036 --> 04:30.301
The demand.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.171
I'm actually only 29 years old,
so the banks don't look at me

04:33.239 --> 04:35.974
With a lot of--you know, a lot
of security, so.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.577
And what's your background?

04:38.645 --> 04:40.312
You know, this sort of industry
has been my passion.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.380
I used to race professional
motocross.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.915
No way!

04:43.917 --> 04:45.817
[chase] and then I actually
bought a snowmobile.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.687
I had a bunch of problems with
it, so I fully redesigned

04:48.755 --> 04:51.456
The hood and found that if I
wanted to continue to design

04:51.458 --> 04:53.225
Stuff I have to get some of my
own equipment.

04:54.194 --> 04:57.362
I taught myself cad and all the
different design softwares to be

04:57.430 --> 04:58.530
Able to use it.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.731
-Good for you.
-Yeah.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.467
-Do you know what you've done?
-I like to think I do.

05:02.535 --> 05:03.869
You're so humble though.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.337
-You're really humble.
-Thank you.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.105
So, chase, who all helped you
come up with your valuation

05:07.173 --> 05:08.740
Of $6.6 million?

05:10.077 --> 05:11.743
That was through my accountant
and my family.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.747
So my parents, my mom and dad
are--they are involved

05:15.749 --> 05:16.648
In the company.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.050
My dad's actually the delivery
driver.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.318
-Okay.
-[michele laughs]

05:20.321 --> 05:22.120
[chase] and he drives trucks all
over.

05:22.188 --> 05:23.288
That's so cute.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.991
[chase] and then my mom,
she does all my accounting.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.360
Yeah, I think with where our
profit margins are,

05:28.428 --> 05:29.928
I definitely think it's
a fair valuation.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.830
So are your parents
investigators in the company

05:31.832 --> 05:32.864
Or do you pay them or--

05:32.933 --> 05:34.499
-No, they are not.
-They're just helping you out?

05:34.567 --> 05:36.401
-[chase] correct.
-Do they make a salary?

05:36.469 --> 05:39.371
My mom, I actually--I actually
bought her a new truck.

05:39.439 --> 05:40.505
-There you go.
-[manjit] okay.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.873
[chase] so that keeps her happy.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.677
And my dad last year for
christmas got a 1969 chevelle.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.878
[wes] there you go, good job.

05:46.947 --> 05:47.946
[manjit] this is a family
business.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.648
[arlene] so, chase, I'm gonna
make you an offer.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.583
I don't wanna take any equity.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.952
I would give you the million
dollars for a 10% royalty.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.989
And I'll do that until I get
three times my capital back.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.691
-And then I'm out.
-Thank you.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.293
I appreciate that.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.797
Chase, for me, it's not a
company yet.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.532
It's a single product.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.437
I wish you had more proof that
the tonneau cover is gonna be

06:12.505 --> 06:13.538
Something that the market is
looking for

06:13.606 --> 06:16.274
And that you have sales.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.509
I'm gonna be out.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.712
I'm not gonna make you an offer.

06:21.414 --> 06:26.184
One of the--one of the elements
in any business that sometimes

06:26.186 --> 06:32.424
Stabilizes the business and
allows for risk financing is

06:32.492 --> 06:35.460
The real estate,
and so I'll be out.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.131
Chase, you know, you're a
smooth, man.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.334
You're just--we see smooth guys
come in here and talk smooth.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.702

06:52.212 --> 06:54.079
-I like arlene's deal.
-Okay.

06:54.915 --> 07:01.420
And I would love to come in on
her deal, if she is interested?

07:01.488 --> 07:03.789
-Yeah, I would do that.
-There you go.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.423
Thank you, guys.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.892

07:11.231 --> 07:12.464

07:13.299 --> 07:14.766

possible deal on the table,

right now.

09:04.844 --> 09:09.180
This machine helps us sort the
fruit from the leaves

09:09.248 --> 09:10.281
And the sticks.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.984
We're gonna have you, vince,
do the old method.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.586
And voilà!

09:14.588 --> 09:15.720
What the hell is that?

09:15.789 --> 09:17.155
[alex] I'm gonna race you to see
which one's faster.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.957
You're gonna race me with the
machine, okay.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.825
-[alex] yes, so--
-my bet's on the machine.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.160
-[vincenzo] all right.
-[alex] ready?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.561
-[vincenzo] yeah, I'm ready.
-Go!

09:23.630 --> 09:26.364
[dianne] the brothers use this
machine for their urban harvest

09:26.433 --> 09:28.333
To collect crab apples from
homeowners' trees

09:28.401 --> 09:29.768
And city spaces.

09:30.537 --> 09:31.469
Come on, vince.

09:31.537 --> 09:32.437
You can do better.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.238
[alex] he is doing pretty good.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.271
[manjit] oh wow!

09:34.341 --> 09:35.206
[dianne] the harvested fruit is
then juiced,

09:35.275 --> 09:36.942
And later made into
crab apple products.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.578
[alex] so now basically think
about doing that for about

09:40.647 --> 09:44.949
125,000 pounds, and that's what
we were doing before we came up

09:45.018 --> 09:47.218
And patented this machine.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.686
And what is this next to us?

09:48.755 --> 09:49.854
So that's actually where we're
gonna go next.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.823
So as I mentioned, we do have
some products in market.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.258
We're knocking on the door of
600 stores.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.693
These are products that are
available.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.462
Feel free to enjoy them while
we're here.

09:58.564 --> 10:00.898
This is a traditional
pioneer-style crab apple jelly.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.768
We also make four different
flavours of crab apple

10:03.837 --> 10:05.103
Cocktail mix.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.037
[manjit] the juicy pear, it's
delicious.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.106
All it needs is a shot of vodka
[chuckles].

10:08.174 --> 10:09.641
How did you come up with this?

10:10.410 --> 10:12.543
Well, we basically always made
crab apple jelly

10:12.612 --> 10:14.446
As a family tradition.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.982
When glen was in university, we
decided to pick the entire tree

10:17.985 --> 10:21.019
At our front parent's place--

10:21.021 --> 10:23.721
And very quickly realized
there's no way we can eat

10:23.790 --> 10:28.559
All of this jam, so we called up
a local cheese shop, said,

10:28.562 --> 10:30.028
"hey, do you want
some of the this?"

10:30.096 --> 10:32.196
They said, "sure, we'll buy
everything you can have."

10:32.265 --> 10:33.932
Easiest $600 we ever made.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.800
And then three or four months
later, the cheese shop called us

10:35.868 --> 10:38.770
And said, "hey, can we buy more
crab apple jelly?"

10:38.838 --> 10:40.472
And my first reaction was,
"yeah, of course,"

10:40.540 --> 10:42.707
But it turns out
the answer is no.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.609
You actually can't go and
commercially buy

10:44.677 --> 10:45.943
Crab apples anymore.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.345
And that's actually what started
us down this whole path.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.913
Really?

10:48.981 --> 10:52.850
As apple growing and farming
just became more mechanized,

10:52.853 --> 10:57.355
It just became too hard to work
with these tiny, tiny apples.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.023
They go bad very quickly.

10:59.026 --> 11:03.461
Instead of like going and
harvesting and then taking it

11:03.463 --> 11:05.563
To the copacker, we juice and
freeze.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.600
And that juice doesn't degrade
over time.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.502
You're using food science to
your advantage.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.669
That's fantastic.

11:11.738 --> 11:15.206
So you guys hire people to go
pick the apples.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.710
And then do you guys pay for the
apples too?

11:18.778 --> 11:19.678
No.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.245
You will have to eventually pay
for the apples.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.380
I doubt it.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.581
People are just happy that
they're not going to waste.

11:23.650 --> 11:24.916
[manjit] not everybody is gonna
give you them for free.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.986
So it's sort a win-win for the
cities because they pay a ton

11:28.054 --> 11:30.422
To have their grounds crew clean
it up.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.624
-Clean up because they rot.
-[alex] and pests, like mice.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.127
So you think your costs of goods
for as long as you can see

11:36.129 --> 11:38.196
Are gonna be free,
it's just the labour?

11:38.198 --> 11:41.199
Yeah, we're only harvesting
about 30% to 40% of the capacity

11:41.267 --> 11:42.967
That we know of as of right now.

11:43.936 --> 11:47.171
That being said, we both looked
at that and said there's

11:47.240 --> 11:48.673
A serious cap on this.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.608
So as of four days ago, we've
planted the world's first

11:50.677 --> 11:53.411
High-density crab apple orchard
so we can actually transition

11:53.480 --> 11:56.781
From an urban harvest as our
primary source of apples into

11:56.850 --> 11:59.651
A more traditional
growing style.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.054
Have you sold these?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.289
And where are they being sold?

12:04.357 --> 12:06.491
We're knocking on the door of
about 600 accounts right now,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.893
Anchored by major chains like
sobeys and metro,

12:08.961 --> 12:10.428
And a number of independent
loblaws centres.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.063
So are you in them or you're
knocking on their door?

12:12.131 --> 12:13.297
No, no, we're in them.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.398
-We--
-[manjit] okay, you're in them?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.299
Yeah.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.567
So what's your revenue last 12
months?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.069
Last 12 months about $185,000.

12:18.771 --> 12:22.240
You only have $185,000 in
revenue for all five products?

12:22.308 --> 12:23.374
That's right.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.009
How long you been in the doors
for?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.245
About four years, most of them.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.679
-Whoa.
-[glen] we added--

12:28.748 --> 12:30.648
[manjit] that's not much
sell-through.

12:30.716 --> 12:31.916
[glen] that's right.

12:31.984 --> 12:33.718
One of the major challenges that
we face for the crab apples is

12:33.787 --> 12:36.354
An educational standpoint, so
we've actually found a clever

12:36.356 --> 12:39.023
Way to tackle that, and that's
actually the raw juice.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.526
So although we sell our crab
apple products,

12:41.528 --> 12:43.161
The majority of the
profitability and the majority

12:43.229 --> 12:45.330
Of the direction of the company
is actually gonna be

12:45.398 --> 12:47.332
Line extensions to other
existing companies.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.668
You mean going to another
cocktail mix provider

12:50.670 --> 12:55.072
And saying, "I will make you a
crab apple varietal"?

12:55.075 --> 12:57.609
So what we would actually do is
go to somebody like let's say

12:57.677 --> 13:00.945
Chapman's, and they would make a
crab apple white chocolate ice

13:00.947 --> 13:05.216
Cream, and we would be on label
by offering them a discount on

13:05.284 --> 13:06.450
The juice.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.752
So you're an ingredient company?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.487
That's right.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.857
On $185,000 in sales last 12
months, what did you net?

13:13.927 --> 13:16.861
Right now, we're positive
$16,000, although the cost

13:16.929 --> 13:18.263
Of the orchard is gonna put us
negative.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.665
So how did you get to $2
million?

13:20.733 --> 13:22.033
[manjit] so, why it is worth $2
million?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.635
[vincenzo] yeah, why is it worth
$2 million?

13:23.703 --> 13:26.003
So the reason that we're looking
at such a large multiple on our

13:26.072 --> 13:28.606
Top line sales is the fact that
the apples that we're bringing

13:28.674 --> 13:30.475
To market are exceptionally
valuable.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.712
And now, we actually have the
technology, the apples,

13:34.780 --> 13:37.782
And we're ready to actually run
and build out that additional

13:37.784 --> 13:40.318
Market and find those brand
partners to bring them in.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.921
The fact of the matter is it's
not worth $2 million.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.524
But what you're entirely
discounting at this point is

13:46.526 --> 13:49.627
You're looking at $185,000 as
though that's all that is here.

13:50.730 --> 13:54.465
We have never sold crab apple
juice on a multiple

13:54.533 --> 13:55.934
To other companies.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.269
I can't do the--I mean, I could
do the deal...

13:58.338 --> 13:59.971
[manjit] don't.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.640
...But I'd have to take at least
45% for $200,000.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.743
I guess you must like crab
apples more than us.

14:05.811 --> 14:06.878
Look, I'm gonna have to be out,
guys.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.646
I can't.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.616

here.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.883
You're right!

14:12.953 --> 14:15.086
If everybody could do it, it
would already be on the market.

four years!

14:18.058 --> 14:19.757

17:29.082 --> 17:31.249
A former flight attendant from
richmond hill, ontario.

17:32.418 --> 17:33.751
She's hoping her new snack food
will cause

17:33.753 --> 17:35.353
A dragon feeding frenzy.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.588
Hello dragons.

17:37.656 --> 17:41.692
I'm shifa, and I'm here today to
ask you for $100,000

17:41.694 --> 17:44.295
In exchange for 20% of my
company, dear snackers.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.898
Dragons, imagine this:

17:47.901 --> 17:49.900
Dinner is still a few hours away
but you need something

17:49.903 --> 17:51.669
Satisfying to get you through.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.740
In your snack cupboard, you have
your usual suspects--chips,

17:57.143 --> 17:59.410
Corn puffs--but you're tired of
those,

17:59.479 --> 18:00.911
And they're not very healthy.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.481
You want something satisfying,
delicious,

18:03.549 --> 18:04.682
And bursting with flavour.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.452
You want dear snackers makhanas.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.656
They're naturally vegan,
gluten-free, and paleo-friendly.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.259
They're grown without the use of
pesticides, fertilizers,

18:15.327 --> 18:18.629
And chemicals, making them a
truly sustainable

18:18.697 --> 18:20.131
And guilt-free snack option.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.701
Sounds too good to be true.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.537
Dragons, would you like to try
your new favourite snack?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.105
-Yes.
-Yes, please!

18:28.174 --> 18:29.473
-[manjit] all right.
-[wes] yes, we would.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.976
-Look at this.
-Can I eat as much as I want?

18:31.978 --> 18:33.310
[shifa] yes.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.680
So, makhanas are actually popped
waterlily seeds, and beside you,

18:36.749 --> 18:38.583
You have our three delicious
flavours.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.185
First we have our barbecue.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.287
The next is our golden turmeric.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.189
And the last but not least is
our sweet and salty.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.259
So I'd love to hear what you
think.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.194
-They're kinda interesting.
-Manjit, do you like it?

18:50.196 --> 18:52.230
-Not really.
-I like this one a lot.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.999
They have an odd texture to
them.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.337
Like, it's not a puff, it's not
a popcorn.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.506
-It's no chips.
-No, it's certainly not.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.209
So this is actually a superfood
that's been traditionally grown,

19:05.278 --> 19:07.278
And it hails from india.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.981
They're not only good, full of
function and health benefits

19:10.049 --> 19:12.016
For our bodies, but also for the
planet.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.119
But 100 calories a cup is a lot
more than popcorn.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.887
But we're actually twice the
amount of protein

19:16.890 --> 19:18.189
And twice the amount of iron as
a regular serving of popcorn.

19:18.257 --> 19:19.690
That's good.

19:19.758 --> 19:22.193
So, it's really great for
vegetarians and vegans.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.127
So it's a seed?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.395
Can you show us how they harvest
it?

19:24.397 --> 19:25.730
Absolutely, yes.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.064
So that's actually the farmers.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.400
They go into the pond to
actually harvest

19:29.468 --> 19:30.768
The waterlily plant.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.269
And this is them roasting it.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.139
Most of our farmers there are
female, so we hire 70% female

19:35.141 --> 19:38.275
Farmers in order to support
women in these rural communities

19:38.278 --> 19:40.144
And provide them with good
stable jobs.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.149
We manufacture them here at our
copacking facility in toronto.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.618
Currently, I don't work with a

19:47.686 --> 19:50.454
I'm actually delivering these

I know from personal experience
that the school system doesn't

26:04.463 --> 26:06.597
Prepare us to enter the business
world.

26:06.665 --> 26:07.731
-True.
-Totally.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.567
And we believe that yougopoly
could be a game-changer.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.970
Hi dragons, I'm pamela.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.205
Everything I learned about money
I learned from my dad.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.540
-[manjit] me too.
-[wes] oh, nice.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.509
He's a self-taught businessman
and has worked hard all his life

26:19.512 --> 26:21.145
To provide for our family.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.348
Now, we're here to make him grow
his business

26:24.416 --> 26:25.883
And realize his dream.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.452
[both] and now it's our dream
too.

26:29.688 --> 26:32.957
[carla] we want students from 11
to 17 to become

26:33.025 --> 26:34.124
Financially literate...

26:34.126 --> 26:35.492
Great mission.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.429
...To learn the value of money
and how to invest

26:38.497 --> 26:39.663
And spend wisely.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.799
Dragons, we have a version of
our game right next to you.

26:42.868 --> 26:43.767
[wes] oh, okay.

26:43.836 --> 26:44.501
-Let's have a look.
-[michele] let's see!

26:44.569 --> 26:46.103
-Whoa!
-Voilà!

26:46.171 --> 26:47.237
-[vincenzo] voilà!

26:47.305 --> 26:49.106
-[laughter]
-[manjit] money.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.107
[vincenzo] money.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.709
Cards, dice, and little
airplanes.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.144
[arlene] it looks very--vaguely
familiar.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.412
-[michele] oh my gosh.
-No way [laughs].

26:55.414 --> 26:56.546
[carla] it's more about the
concept.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.215
[manjit] I love board games in
my house.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.483
-[pamela] oh yeah.
-[carla] oh, that's cool.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.018
[manjit] but this one reminds me
of one that we play

27:01.086 --> 27:03.153
All the time:
Monopoly.

27:03.222 --> 27:06.590
Okay, monopoly, once you get on
somebody's square, you pay him.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.158
-[manjit and michele] yes.
-This, no.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.326
-[michele] okay.
-[michele] what do you do?

27:09.394 --> 27:10.661
[carla] you invest--you have
your own companies,

27:10.729 --> 27:12.663
Invest in aerospace, and there's
a demand for aerospace,

27:12.731 --> 27:16.433
Somebody around the table also
invest in aerospace,

27:16.502 --> 27:18.502
So you compete for the sell.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.937
[arlene] that is monopoly.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.472
[carla] first step, you arrive
in a country, you invest in

27:22.541 --> 27:26.710
A sector of activity, you buy
the operating permit,

27:26.778 --> 27:28.245
And after the next turn you'll
be able to set up

27:28.247 --> 27:29.413
Your enterprise.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.447
Oh, okay.

27:30.515 --> 27:33.717
But be careful, because if your
fees are coming,

27:33.785 --> 27:35.486
You're gonna have to pay for--

27:35.554 --> 27:37.187
-You pay taxes.
-Yeah!

27:37.189 --> 27:38.522
[arlene] that is monopoly.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.557
But how is this really teaching
them about financial literacy?

27:41.694 --> 27:43.493
I don't completely understand
that.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.629
Okay, so you need to invest
wisely.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.100
You take advantage of timing,
luck, and good decisions.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.601
[manjit] mm hmm.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.469
[carla] just like a good
entrepreneur does.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.437
[manjit] right.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.205
And that's all what the game is
about.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.940
So tell me about where you think
it can go.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.544
We have a site that sells
directly online,

28:00.612 --> 28:03.047
And we're in touch with friends
of mine in miami--

28:03.816 --> 28:05.515
[wes] carla, sorry, how many
schools have you got locked down

28:05.518 --> 28:07.317
To say, "yeah, we're gonna buy
this?"

28:07.385 --> 28:10.787
[carla] okay, so we went to ten
schools, and economics teacher,

28:10.856 --> 28:11.922
They all say yes.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.156
Directors say yes.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.325
How long ago did you create the
board game?

28:15.394 --> 28:18.795
So, arlene, the previous version
of the game was business go,

28:18.798 --> 28:20.230
Okay?

28:20.299 --> 28:24.167
And he sold for 10,000 units
$100,000 back in the day.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.002
So, we were not sure if we wanna
talk about that but you might

28:26.005 --> 28:28.805
Go, like, "oh, it was 20 years
ago."

28:28.874 --> 28:31.341
How much money have you invested
in this?

28:31.409 --> 28:34.111
We have 10,000 board games ready
to sell.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.448
-[arlene] yeah.
-So $10 each, it's--

28:38.517 --> 28:39.316
-[michele] that's $100,000.
-[danny] yeah.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.584
[arlene] but what about over the
years?

28:40.652 --> 28:42.719
Like, you've been at this for
quite a while.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.155
He did zero debt, and he did
profit with the previous

28:45.223 --> 28:46.123
Version, so--

28:46.191 --> 28:47.491
[manjit] but that was 20 years
ago.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.425
[carla] I know, but right now--

28:48.427 --> 28:49.459
[manjit] you're not making any
money,

28:49.462 --> 28:50.827
So how are you guys surviving?

28:50.830 --> 28:53.697
We're living in an
intergenerational house

28:53.699 --> 28:55.699
With my grandparents
and everything.

28:55.701 --> 28:59.269
I used to have a job, but I say
like I wanna go full time.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.204
-You left the job to do this?
-Yes.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.840
[manjit] so not only are you all
in on this,

29:03.909 --> 29:06.243
Like your whole
family is all in?

29:06.311 --> 29:07.544
[pamela] yes.

29:07.546 --> 29:08.845
[carla] if we were here 100
years ago presenting monopoly

29:08.848 --> 29:09.746
To you, would you invest?

29:09.815 --> 29:10.747
Wow, come on.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.415
Come on.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.985
-Have you sold any yet?
-Not of this version.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.419
We're doing the relaunching.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.855
But for business go, which is
exactly the same concept

29:18.924 --> 29:21.525
With different graphics, he did
a market test,

29:21.593 --> 29:24.161
And in only three months,
he sold 10,000.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.629
Like monopoly, it's a timeless
game.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.164
So the answer is zero then?

29:27.232 --> 29:31.802
Okay, I think this can become
the next monopoly, okay?

29:31.870 --> 29:34.404
-We don't wanna get--
-whoa, that's a big claim.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.440
Yes, and I think in life,
if you don't have big claims,

29:37.509 --> 29:40.010
You're not gonna go anywhere.

29:40.078 --> 29:41.879
It's like the real life, okay?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.079
It's my life.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.548
The board is my life.

29:44.616 --> 29:49.386
Because I was--I were in
business since 25 years ago.

29:49.454 --> 29:53.056
I think the real issue here is
you've invested $100,000

29:53.124 --> 29:55.091
In product before you've made
any sales.

29:55.094 --> 29:58.528
You haven't got a strategy for
which markets you're gonna

29:58.597 --> 29:59.996
Attack and why.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.731
There's just too many things
that you're failing

30:01.800 --> 30:03.333
On a business front for me.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.202
I think the passion and the game
is misplaced.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.037
-I'm gonna be out.
-Okay.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.706
[michele] danny, let me ask you
the question.

30:09.774 --> 30:12.175
Did the iphone exist 20 years
ago when you sold

30:12.178 --> 30:13.844
10,000 units before?

30:14.647 --> 30:16.213
-[carla] the iphone, no.
-[danny] no.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.781
-So time's have changed.
-[carla] yeah, internet now.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.383
[michele] kids are playing very
different games.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.186
Like, you can't use a test from
20 years ago

30:23.255 --> 30:24.855
And make it relevant today.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.824
And so for that reason,
I have to be out.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.793
Yeah, but it's timeless,
like monopoly.

30:29.861 --> 30:30.661
It's timeless.

30:30.729 --> 30:31.862
[manjit] no, no, no,
that's irrelevant.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.164
If it was timeless,
you would still be selling it

30:34.232 --> 30:34.998
20 years later.

30:35.067 --> 30:35.832
You've sold zero.

30:35.901 --> 30:38.535
We are talking about this game.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.671
We're not talking about what you
did before, because it's

30:40.739 --> 30:41.939
Irrelevant now.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.575
He had demand and he couldn't
produce because we were young--

30:45.644 --> 30:48.478
Carla, I think deep down you
know that this isn't gonna work,

30:48.480 --> 30:50.547
And you're only doing it because
you love your dad.

30:50.549 --> 30:51.615
Is that true?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.417
[pamela] no, we really believe
in the product too.

30:53.485 --> 30:54.951
We love our dad for sure but--

30:55.020 --> 30:56.920
What I truly think,
if you guys were playing

30:56.988 --> 30:58.188
This game tonight...

30:58.256 --> 30:59.289
[danny] you'll love it.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.490
...You're gonna understand why I
have so much passion.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.725
It's not just because I love my
dad.

31:01.727 --> 31:02.960
[pamela] no.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.395
So I think it's a little unfair
to say, "oh, just because you're

31:05.463 --> 31:06.763
Passionate you wanna help your
dad."

31:06.831 --> 31:07.697
I think that's wrong.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.132
And I don't think it's the case.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.501
I think you're very early.

31:11.569 --> 31:16.373
I'm gonna be out, but I'd invite
you to come back with sales,

31:16.441 --> 31:20.110
Because I actually think that
there is a need for this

31:20.178 --> 31:21.511
In middle school
and high schools.

31:22.247 --> 31:23.413
So and that's the majority of
our school.

31:23.481 --> 31:26.383
Vincenzo, they've been at it for
20 years,

31:26.451 --> 31:27.317
And they're a little early?

31:27.319 --> 31:28.384
They've not been at it for 20
years,

31:28.454 --> 31:29.853
And that's because you guys
are not listening.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.189
22 years ago, he sold 10,000 of
them.

31:33.558 --> 31:34.424
-Then he raised his kids.
-[pamela] exactly, that's it.

31:34.493 --> 31:35.592
[vincenzo] and now he's back at
it.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.659
[pamela] exactly.

31:36.729 --> 31:37.727
[vincenzo] so he hasn't been at
it for 22 years.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.229
It's an idea from 22 years ago
that he's refining

31:39.297 --> 31:40.263
And bringing it back.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.331
[michele] but he's using the
market validation

31:41.333 --> 31:42.532
From 20 years ago.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.366
[wes] it doesn't matter all the
good things he's saying, guys,

31:43.435 --> 31:44.600
He said he's out.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.137
So here's the thing, I'm not
gonna recommend to you guys

31:47.205 --> 31:50.140
To come back because I don't
think you should.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.708
I'm not gonna invest,
and I'm out.

31:52.877 --> 31:55.645
[vincenzo] always surprised to
see how we downplay passion.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.648
There's blind passion though
here!

31:57.716 --> 31:59.616
[vincenzo] but it's still
passion!

32:00.618 --> 32:03.653
You guys get an a for effort but
an f for execution.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.222
I'm out.

32:08.293 --> 32:10.360
-So I guess everybody's out?
-[manjit] take care.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.662
[everyone] bye.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.030

[andrew] we're the co-founders
of neale's sweet n' nice

32:45.730 --> 32:47.030
Ice cream.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.698
Sweet n' nice.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.000
Come get your sweet n' nice.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.203
[andrew] we stepped into the den
in 2014 and wowed

32:53.271 --> 32:56.206
The dragons with our
caribbean ice cream.

32:56.274 --> 32:57.507
[stafford] I think the creamy
flavour, it presented

32:57.576 --> 33:00.810
A different taste profile that
they'd never experienced before.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.412
-[woman 1] save a dollar off.
-[woman 2] thank you.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.581
[woman 1] you're welcome.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.516
[stafford] so since the den, we
generated a lot of excitement.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.752
And then since then, we were
able to expand

33:08.820 --> 33:09.953
With our independent stores.

33:10.022 --> 33:13.123
And then, you know, at some
point, we actually met wes hall.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.091
Funny enough,
I did a<i> dragons' den</i> deal

33:15.094 --> 33:17.160
Before I became a dragon.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.929
You know, I met with wes at his
office on bay street.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.699
He fell in love with the story
and he said right away he wanted

33:22.768 --> 33:25.669
To be a part of it, invest in us
and take us further.

33:27.138 --> 33:29.172
I wanted to go to any of the
major stores,

33:29.174 --> 33:31.241
And I wanna be able to pick up
neale's sweet n' nice

33:31.309 --> 33:34.244
Because I loved the ice cream.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.046
[stafford] you know, we signed
up with 100 stores

33:36.048 --> 33:37.781
When we met him.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.816
We've now expanded to 700 stores
across canada.

33:39.884 --> 33:42.318
Honestly, we couldn't have
achieved that without wes' help.

And then--

36:48.439 --> 36:49.939
I worked for heinz and I worked
for diageo...

36:50.008 --> 36:50.907

36:50.976 --> 36:52.475
...So two very large alcohol and
food businesses.

36:53.178 --> 36:55.445
And one of the things when I
noticed in terms of trends was

36:55.513 --> 36:57.247
Nonalcoholic spirits.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.983
And I was at a point in my life

37:00.051 --> 37:02.585
Bit healthier options, and I
thought that what I tasted

37:02.654 --> 37:04.654

But without the alcohol.

37:14.098 --> 37:15.332
So I developed a recipe in
conjunction

37:15.400 --> 37:16.399
With niagara college...

37:16.467 --> 37:17.400
Okay.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.002

making the process

37:19.070 --> 37:20.403
Food safety safe.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.372
To make a product that actually
tastes like alcohol and take

37:22.440 --> 37:24.708
The alcohol out, it's not easy.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.309

done?

37:26.377 --> 37:27.510
Have you done anything else?

37:27.578 --> 37:28.878
Yeah, so so far just gin.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.514
But actually, next week I'm
starting to commercialize

37:31.582 --> 37:32.615
A tequila.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.950
Wow.

37:34.953 --> 37:37.353
And so how much do you sell a
bottle for?

37:37.422 --> 37:39.022
The bottles--the large bottles
go for around $34 to $35

37:39.090 --> 37:40.190
At retail.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.357
How much does it cost you to
make?

37:41.426 --> 37:43.126
It's around $8.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.296
You effectively have a really
cool flavoured water.

37:46.864 --> 37:49.399
That's not meant as an insult
so--but that's what it is.

37:51.236 --> 37:53.736
So, will the consumer really pay
$34 for that?

37:53.805 --> 37:55.005
Well, they have.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.373
The category is not just a fad.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.808
But your price point is pretty
high.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.077
Like for $35, I can get a nice
gin.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.280
You're not selling them 40%
alcohol in there,

38:04.349 --> 38:05.982
But you're charging them the
same amount of price.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.384
And it's a stock bottle, it's a
stock cap.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.387
[bob] so there is--part of the
sober--part of the category of

38:11.456 --> 38:14.457
Sober curious is people are
looking for options that

38:14.526 --> 38:16.459
Essentially reduce their alcohol
consumption

38:16.527 --> 38:18.762
And that may be for health and
wellness reasons.

38:19.598 --> 38:22.899
The value for the product inside
of it, I don't think it's there.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.003
People in the health and
wellness space will pay a

38:27.072 --> 38:28.871
Premium for something that they
think helps

38:28.940 --> 38:30.139
With their health journey.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.709
If you don't wanna drink gin,
you're not looking for the price

38:32.777 --> 38:34.477
Of gin, you're looking for
something that you could

38:34.545 --> 38:36.245
Actually enjoy.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.314
My only concern is how are you
gonna get this product known

38:38.317 --> 38:39.616
To people?

38:39.618 --> 38:40.750
[diandra] well, right now, our
current strategy is finding

38:40.819 --> 38:43.186
Influencers that have really
strong communities in the health

38:43.254 --> 38:45.655
And wellness space,
in the fitness space,

38:45.723 --> 38:46.990
And also in the foodie space.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.626
And so starting with that, we
see a lot of engagement coming

38:49.694 --> 38:52.362
Down from all of these campaigns
from these influencers.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.499
When did you put this product on
the market?

38:56.501 --> 38:59.435
So I put the product on the
market in the fall of 2019.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.670
Okay.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.639

I'm gonna do $300,000 in sales.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.876
Certainly we'll continue to
invest in e-commerce

39:06.878 --> 39:11.047
From the success that we've
seen, however,

39:11.049 --> 39:13.182
The allure of retail is--

39:13.251 --> 39:14.951

39:35.339 --> 39:36.940
Free entry into the u.S.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.075
It's basically entering as a
food product.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.610
So what's your strategy there?

39:40.612 --> 39:42.311
