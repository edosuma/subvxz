♪♪

00:06.340 --> 00:09.341
You know, this is nice,
all of us hanging out.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.777
Yeah, you know,
Ruby, there actually
used to be a time

00:11.779 --> 00:14.613
where we couldn't all relax
together without one
of our parents calling a--

00:14.615 --> 00:16.315
Family meeting!

00:16.317 --> 00:18.017
(gong clangs)

00:18.019 --> 00:21.120
Yay! It's my first one!

00:21.122 --> 00:22.388
I banged a gong!

00:24.558 --> 00:27.960
So I spoke with Dad,
and it's official,
our house in Wisconsin

00:27.962 --> 00:29.962
will be done
by the end of summer!

00:29.964 --> 00:31.196
What?

00:31.198 --> 00:33.899
I'm moving home!

00:33.901 --> 00:36.368
But I will be separated
from my four kids.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.804
Liv will stay in LA
for her show.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.206
Maddie has SCSU
and the basketball team.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.008
Joey's going off to college.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.144
And my youngest will be
in a biodome,

00:45.146 --> 00:47.179
studying life on Mars.

00:47.181 --> 00:50.349
Oh, I'll miss Parker,
of course, but we did just
rebuild the house he leveled,

00:50.351 --> 00:52.985
so a year away
isn't such a bad idea.

00:52.987 --> 00:56.488
But I still have the summer
in California with my babies.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.491
So, we are gonna make this...

00:59.493 --> 01:02.227

02:14.435 --> 02:19.471
Oh, your joyful vibration
has me tingling with curiosity.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.341
Coach said if we do well
at summer training camp,

02:22.343 --> 02:24.910
we'll both be in
the starting lineup this fall!

02:24.912 --> 02:26.478
Oh!

02:26.480 --> 02:27.646
-(doorbell rings)
-I swear,

02:27.648 --> 02:29.748
if the Summer of Rooney
gets any better,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.050
I'm gonna punch someone.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.319
Surprise!

02:34.321 --> 02:36.522
Diggie, you're here
a day early!

02:36.524 --> 02:38.090
Yeah-- Aah!

02:39.493 --> 02:41.760
Okay, you're punching people,
so I know you're in a good mood.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.299
I'm going to SCSU this fall
to pursue my dream

02:47.301 --> 02:50.502
of being a sports announcer.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.505
And I get to spend
my entire summer with Maddie.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.941
With authority!

02:57.344 --> 02:59.344
You should stop doing
that voice.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.013
It's really stupid.

03:01.015 --> 03:04.049
Ooh, rejected.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.519
Nah, don't wait
for me, Diggie.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.121
I just drove us
2,000 miles

03:09.123 --> 03:10.556
while you took selfies
of your hair in the wind.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.724
How ya doin'?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.826
Dump Truck,
what are you doing here?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.495
Well, I started my own
movin' business.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.996
Dump Truck Truckin'.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.500
My motto is,
"I move you. You pay me."

03:21.502 --> 03:23.368
Yeah, I moved Diggie out here,
which reminds me,

03:23.370 --> 03:26.038
I move you, you pay me.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.309
Welcome to Cali, guys.
Have you seen their backyard?

03:30.311 --> 03:31.510
There's a trampoline.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.011
-Trampoline.
-Dibs! Dibs!

03:33.013 --> 03:35.747
I called Dibs, Dump Truck!

03:35.749 --> 03:38.016
A letter came for you.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.552
I think it's about that grant
you applied for.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.155
Oh, building tiny houses
for the homeless,

03:43.157 --> 03:45.557
-it's such a noble cause.
-I got the grant!

03:45.559 --> 03:47.659
Oh! I knew it the minute
I touched the envelope!

03:50.197 --> 03:53.232
Oh, it's this summer,
in New Orleans!

03:53.234 --> 03:56.435
Oh. Well, what about
your summer plans?

03:58.439 --> 03:59.504
Oh.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.708
Yeah. I mean, you're right.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.944
If I do this, I can't do
SCSU training camp.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.214
I can't spend
any time with Diggie.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.850
I can't do the Summer
of Rooney with Mom.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.953
What are you gonna do?
Go or stay?

04:19.460 --> 04:21.460
Uh...

04:21.462 --> 04:22.694
We broke
the trampoline.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.569
Parker!
Did you hear the news?

04:30.571 --> 04:34.106
Uh, that we're gonna be
the best-looking couple
in the biodome?

04:34.108 --> 04:35.440
Couple?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.509
Team! I meant team!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.647
Uh...
So, what's the news?

04:41.649 --> 04:45.484
We're going to the biodome
next week!

04:45.486 --> 04:48.253
What? No, it's
for the school year.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.988
We're not supposed to go
until the end of the summer.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.958
No, that changed
because they moved the biodome

04:52.960 --> 04:58.497
from LA to the salt flats
of Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.065
Salar-salt-de-flutey-
what-now?

05:02.670 --> 05:06.938
We're being groomed to be
astronauts on a future
Mars mission.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.507
Read your e-mails, dude!

05:09.943 --> 05:12.444
Why does it have to be so soon?

05:12.446 --> 05:14.880
And so far away! Bolivia?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.517
Are you okay?

05:18.519 --> 05:22.020
Never better, baby.
I mean, Val.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.822
I don't know what I mean!

05:25.693 --> 05:27.759
Boys are weird.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.632
All right, well, this is it.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.034
My dressing room is
all cleared out.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.438
Liv, honey, baby!
The Bick is back!

05:39.440 --> 05:43.041
Hi! Becky!
Oh, Ruby, this is
my manager, Becky.

05:43.043 --> 05:47.346
Oh... Before you ask,
I don't rep kids.

05:51.018 --> 05:55.387
I have news
about the Broadway show
you auditioned for.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.656
The musical is called
"Double Duchess."

05:57.658 --> 06:00.325
An heir to the throne of England
disguises herself as a commoner,

06:00.327 --> 06:04.496
flies to Brooklyn,
and wins a double Dutch
jump rope contest.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.198
So basically, you know,
it's exactly like "Hamilton,"

06:06.200 --> 06:08.200
but, um, with jump ropes.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.702
Liv...

06:10.704 --> 06:12.371
they want you
to be the lead.

06:12.373 --> 06:15.540
-(gasps)
-You're going
to Broadway, baby!

06:15.542 --> 06:17.576
(squealing)

06:18.912 --> 06:20.912
Oh, wait, wait! Wait!

06:20.914 --> 06:22.714
How can I do
season two of

06:22.716 --> 06:26.084
<i> ♪ Sing it Louder ♪</i>

06:26.086 --> 06:27.652
and also still have
time to do

06:27.654 --> 06:30.122
♪<i> Dubba, Dubba</i>
<i> Double Duchess?</i> ♪

06:31.225 --> 06:34.926
You're doing<i> Duchess</i>
for three months.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.595
You'll be back
for season two!

06:38.332 --> 06:41.633
This is everything
that I have ever wanted.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.603
-When do I leave
for New York?
-Tomorrow.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.538
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

06:46.540 --> 06:50.041
Yes. Oh, I...

06:50.043 --> 06:53.779
I am so sorry I made your dreams
come true so fast.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.582
Buh-bye from the Bick!

07:02.890 --> 07:04.756
Auntie D!

07:04.758 --> 07:06.691
(sighs)
I have some big news.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.427
Oh, don't tell me!

07:08.429 --> 07:11.797
Let me use these cards
to open a window
into your future.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.801
Oh. Well, yippy-skippy,
read me, girl!

07:18.472 --> 07:19.871
Hmm...

07:21.108 --> 07:22.607
(gasps)

07:22.609 --> 07:25.777
This card says
that Jim Breuer called

07:25.779 --> 07:26.878
and wants you to be
the opening act

07:26.880 --> 07:28.647
on his summer comedy tour.

07:28.649 --> 07:32.851
Wow! You are so powerful.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.788
I'm not. I heard him
on the phone.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.924
But now Joey thinks
I'm a wizard.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.827
Aunt Dena is a wizard!

07:41.829 --> 07:44.663
Aunt Dena, stand-up is
my dream.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.598
But the tour starts
next week,

07:46.600 --> 07:49.468
so I'll be gone until
I start college in the fall.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.169
Which means that my dream

07:51.171 --> 07:55.140
will crush Mom's dream
of the Summer of Rooney.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.577
Well, maybe your mom will forget
about the Summer of Rooney.

07:58.579 --> 08:02.647
(singsongy)
I made Summer
of Rooney T-shirts!

08:06.253 --> 08:07.619
Or maybe it's all
she's living for.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.321
Yeah.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.657
Okay, so how do I tell
my mom that I can't do
the Summer of Rooney?

08:12.659 --> 08:16.528
I mean, on one hand, yeah,
touring seems really exciting,

08:16.530 --> 08:20.165
but on the other hand,
this could be my summer
of extreme sand-castling.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.836
What's with the cameras?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.806
Hey, Dump Truck,
are you serious?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.875
You've never noticed
the cameras before?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.877
Four years ago, when Liv
moved back to Stevens Point,

08:31.879 --> 08:34.679
we started shooting
a reality series that airs
in Luxembourg.

08:34.681 --> 08:38.183
This is our crew,
Benoit and Betsy.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.652
You drop this info
so casually.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.388
Not since learning
that Diggie and Artie
was brothers

08:43.390 --> 08:45.690
has my mind been so blown.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.827
Yeah. I mean, the show's
called<i> Bits and Pieces,</i>

08:48.829 --> 08:52.531
also known as
<i> Morceaux et et Pièces.</i>

08:52.533 --> 08:55.333
That's French.
They speak French
in Luxembourg.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.802
I learned that.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.906
So, so they what?
They interview you?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.841
Yeah, yeah.
Pretty much.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.809
I mean, we just talk about,
like, what's going on at school,

09:04.811 --> 09:06.311
our family, our friends.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.214
Oh, I... I don't like that.
I don't like that at all.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.850
I want to know who's been
yapping their mouths
about my comings and goings.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.785
(shouting in French)

09:15.756 --> 09:17.756
Whoa!

09:17.758 --> 09:19.858
Whoa, Dump Truck,
you speak French?

09:19.860 --> 09:23.295
<i> Bien sur.</i> We all
have our secrets.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.270
Hey, Maddie. There are
little kids picking lemons
off your tree outside.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.838
Do you want me
to handle them because...

09:33.840 --> 09:34.973
I will.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.878
Uh... No, that's okay, Willow.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.846
But, um, there is something
that we need to talk about.

09:41.848 --> 09:45.350
Yeah. Sure. What's going on?

09:45.352 --> 09:48.186
We got the grant
to build tiny houses.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.854
What? No way!

09:49.856 --> 09:51.790
-Yeah.
-When do we start?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.025
Um... this summer.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.862
In New Orleans.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.798
But... if you don't go
to camp,

09:59.800 --> 10:02.901
you're not gonna be
a starter next year.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.269
Isn't that your dream?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.173
Yeah. It is.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.143
I just think
that helping people is, like,

10:12.145 --> 10:15.780
so much bigger
than basketball. You know?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.817
And this is
something that I could do
for the rest of my life.

10:21.488 --> 10:25.190
Dude, I... I think
this is what I want to do
for the rest of my life.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.593
Wow. That's big.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.794
Yeah.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.966
Yeah, so...
you know, I gotta go do it.

10:35.902 --> 10:39.004
I gotta go to New Orleans
and I gotta build tiny houses.

10:40.507 --> 10:44.843
And I'll... be back
to, you know, support you,

10:44.845 --> 10:47.312
from the bench,
when you're a starter.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.416
I'm gonna miss you.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.020
Yeah, dude,
I'm gonna miss you, too.

10:57.157 --> 11:01.026
I mean, we've done like,
everything together
since we were 10.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.000
What you're doing
is so cool, Maddie.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.871
I'm so proud of you.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.839
Thank you.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.176
I'm so proud of you, Willow.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.848
-And also, I'm not crying.
-No, neither am I.

11:23.850 --> 11:28.253
(flute playing light melody)

11:34.294 --> 11:36.895
(laughing)

11:36.897 --> 11:39.064
It's the Summer of Rooney
theme song!

11:39.066 --> 11:42.100
Oh, you like it so much
you're crying!

11:49.076 --> 11:51.476
Oh! Hey, Dump Truck.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.977
Hey. (sniffles)

11:55.248 --> 11:58.817
Oh, buddy, are you...
are you crying?

11:58.819 --> 12:02.053
Uh, I just watched
the episode of<i> Bits and Pieces</i>

12:02.055 --> 12:04.723
where Liv shows Todd Stetson
what a girl is.

12:04.725 --> 12:08.093
Oh... oh, buddy,
that is a tough one.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.061
Gets me every time.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.865
Yeah, but, but hey, this show
is totally binge worthy, man

12:13.867 --> 12:15.500
I'm deep into it.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.303
Parker's already got
his man voice now.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.272
I just want to get
to the California part

12:21.274 --> 12:23.041
before uh, before
I gotta get home.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.110
Cool, man.
You're gonna love it.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.377
All right, all right.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.914
He's gonna hate it!
If he sees me as Falcon...

12:29.916 --> 12:32.917
he'll think I stole his persona.

12:32.919 --> 12:37.856
But Falcon was merely
"inspired" by Dump Truck.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.191
Inspired? Look at me.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.294
I'm even wearing the same
T-shirt as Dump Truck.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.631
It was a... dead lift.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.434
Which is fitting
because I am dead.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.803
I'm going on tour this summer
with Jim Breuer.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.539
I can't do that if I'm dead.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.642
Wait. Will Dump Truck see this?

12:57.644 --> 13:00.111
Stop the camera, Benoit! Benoit!

13:06.453 --> 13:07.652
Parker!

13:08.622 --> 13:09.687
Parker!

13:12.159 --> 13:13.658
What are you doing?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.728
Um, hoisting the fridge
up the stairs

13:16.730 --> 13:19.998
so I can wreak havoc
and catastrophe. Duh!

13:22.569 --> 13:24.769
Okay, the last time
that you dropped a fridge
down the stairs,

13:24.771 --> 13:26.137
you were grounded for months.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.472
Do you want to get grounded?

13:29.009 --> 13:32.043
Why would anyone
want to get grounded?

13:33.346 --> 13:34.579
What's going on?

13:40.187 --> 13:44.189
I just found out that
they moved the biodome
from LA to Bolivia.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.991
Wow.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.326
That's really big.

13:48.328 --> 13:53.965
Yeah, but... now it's
halfway across the world,

13:53.967 --> 13:57.669
and it starts next week.
Not months from now.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.677
I'm scared.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.880
I don't think I can do it.

14:11.785 --> 14:16.354
But you've always been so great
at science-y stuff.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.790
I'm not worried about that.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.693
I'm worried about being
away from my family.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.895
I've never done that before.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.233
Hmm...

14:28.235 --> 14:30.869
Well, Parker, I mean,

14:30.871 --> 14:33.037
I definitely know
how you feel.

14:33.039 --> 14:38.009
You know? The first time
that I left to come out here,

14:38.011 --> 14:40.111
I was really scared
to be without you guys.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.148
How'd you do it?

14:44.150 --> 14:45.917
Weren't you worried
things would change?

14:47.187 --> 14:52.190
I mean... if there's one thing
that I've learned
about our family,

14:52.192 --> 14:54.425
it's that they will always
be here for you.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.631
No matter where you go
or how long you're away.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.269
Yeah. That's true.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.204
You know, sometimes
you've gotta feel that fear

15:06.206 --> 15:08.106
and decide
to do it anyway.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.708
If your dreams
aren't scaring you,

15:10.710 --> 15:12.944
you are not dreaming
big enough.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.283
Thanks, Liv.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.617
Yeah.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.954
Guess now I just have
one thing to say.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.190
Can I say it with you
just one time? Okay.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.459
-Challenge accepted!
-Challenge accepted!

15:34.367 --> 15:36.134
Hey, Maddie, check it out.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.136
I got a thumb ring.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.239
This is, this is like,
Cali cool, right?

15:41.241 --> 15:44.008
Please say it is,
'cause I can't get it off.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.547
Oh! Dang it,
it's a part of me now.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.648
Um...

15:50.650 --> 15:52.917
Hey.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.287
I... just got the grant
to build tiny houses.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.455
No way!

15:57.457 --> 16:01.159
-Yeah. Yeah.
-That's great!
Congratulations!

16:01.161 --> 16:02.493
Thank you.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.797
What?

16:08.001 --> 16:13.004
It means that I...
have to leave
for New Orleans tomorrow.

16:13.006 --> 16:18.309
Which then means
that... we can't spend
the summer together.

16:20.013 --> 16:23.247
I don't... understand.

16:23.249 --> 16:29.253
I know... I know. I mean,
I'm so sorry, Diggie, like,

16:29.255 --> 16:33.658
I know you came down here
to spend the whole summer
with me, but I just...

16:33.660 --> 16:38.429
I really feel like
this is something
that I have to go do.

16:38.431 --> 16:44.268
No. I don't understand
why that means we can't
spend the summer together.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.206
I'll come with you.

16:50.210 --> 16:56.347
Maddie... wherever you are,
is where I want to be.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.954
I love you, Digbert Smalls.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.256
I love you, too.

17:12.499 --> 17:16.367
Aw. What a sweet scene.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.805
But full disclosure,
I'm a Josh fan.

17:20.807 --> 17:24.709
Yeah. Team Mosh... forever.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.214
There you are.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.417
Falcon!

17:32.419 --> 17:36.587
Falcon?
I don't-- I don't--
I don't know any Falcon!

17:36.589 --> 17:39.223
Put it on.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.227
Please, please, don't kill me.
Don't kill me for stealing
your essence.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.566
Kill you? Joey, I love Falcon.

17:48.568 --> 17:52.370
Really? You're not mad
I ripped you off?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.238
(laughing)

17:57.110 --> 17:58.443
Oh, Joey.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.446
Falcon is good.

18:01.448 --> 18:05.383
But you can't do me...
better than me.

18:05.385 --> 18:09.921
So says Dump Truck.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.590
<i> Au revoir, Bits and Pieces.</i>

18:12.592 --> 18:15.960
You were too beautiful
for this world.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.096
Wait, wait, wait.
So this is it?

18:18.098 --> 18:21.232
I'm never gonna talk
to the camera ever again?

18:21.234 --> 18:23.367
Well, who will listen
to me now?

18:28.475 --> 18:30.741
Wow.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.477
So we're both leaving,

18:32.479 --> 18:34.278
tomorrow.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.452
Liv, you are gonna kill it
on Broadway.

18:41.454 --> 18:45.923
Thank you.
And Maddie, I am so proud of you

18:45.925 --> 18:48.292
for going
to New Orleans,

18:48.294 --> 18:50.561
I mean, you are gonna
change the world.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.799
Uh... gross.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.768
A barrel of girl tears.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.439
Let me guess, one of them
borrowed a pair of socks
without asking,

19:01.441 --> 19:02.740
and... oh!

19:05.345 --> 19:08.346
Sisters... by chance!

19:08.348 --> 19:14.285
Friends... ah...
ooh, by choice!

19:14.287 --> 19:16.354
(sobbing)

19:16.356 --> 19:20.791
Okay! Okay, are you guys done,
because we actually do need
to tell you something.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.328
Yeah, um... so...

19:24.330 --> 19:26.964
neither of us are gonna
be around for the Summer
of Rooney.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.535
What? No!
You can't do that to Mom!

19:30.537 --> 19:32.503
I'm doing that to Mom!

19:34.040 --> 19:36.307
I'm going on tour
this summer with Jim Breuer.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.043
-(gasps)
-What? Munch,
you can't do that to Mom.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.212
I'm doing that to Mom!

19:42.348 --> 19:45.683
I'm going
to the biodome early.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.553
Wait...
we're all leaving?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.190
You guys...

19:53.359 --> 19:56.127
We're all going our own
separate ways.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.871
I'm gonna miss you guys.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.040
Yeah.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.845
You guys...
how are we gonna
tell Mom

20:14.847 --> 20:16.747
that
we're all leaving?

20:16.749 --> 20:19.183
You're leaving
and you didn't
tell me?

20:19.185 --> 20:21.485
Sorry, but we told her
your secrets.

20:21.487 --> 20:22.820
(clangs)

20:22.822 --> 20:24.755
♪ Apologies ♪

20:27.060 --> 20:30.094
Love it, but, uh...
not the right time.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.563
Mom, we're so sorry,
we just didn't tell you

20:32.565 --> 20:35.600
because we didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

20:35.602 --> 20:39.070
Yeah, we also
didn't want to, like, ruin
the Summer of Rooney.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.504
But I guess we did.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.473
And we're really sorry.

20:45.345 --> 20:50.781
Parker... Joey...
Liv... Maddie.

20:50.783 --> 20:54.619
The greatest gift a mother
can get is knowing

20:54.621 --> 20:57.021
that she raised her kids
to be confident enough

20:57.023 --> 20:58.889
to pursue their dreams.

20:58.891 --> 21:02.193
Watching you guys
become the wonderful people
you've become

21:02.195 --> 21:05.863
has been... so inspiring.

21:05.865 --> 21:11.135
So remember...
wherever you go,
may your dreams

21:11.137 --> 21:15.906
always be big...
and your worries small.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.275
I love you guys.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.477
-I love you, Mom.
-Love you too, Mom.

21:26.386 --> 21:30.388
Okay...
so we can't have
one last Summer of Rooney,

21:30.390 --> 21:33.791
but... that doesn't mean
we can't have one last night
of Rooney, right?

21:33.793 --> 21:35.226
Oh, hey...

21:35.228 --> 21:39.530
I love that.
Guys, let's do it.
Bam! What?

21:42.468 --> 21:47.438
Okay, let's finish our Night
of Rooney with a bonfire
secret sesh.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.573
We'll all share something
that no one knows.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.509
Okay, who wants to go first?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.411
All right, I'll go.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.980
For the past 15 years,
I have been moonlighting

21:55.982 --> 21:58.649
as a birthday party clown!

22:00.420 --> 22:02.653
What?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.022
My name is Tangles.
You want to see my silly walk?

22:05.024 --> 22:06.691

No.

22:06.693 --> 22:10.861
Um, well, sometimes
I hold my own hand
and pretend

22:10.863 --> 22:12.229
I have a boyfriend.

22:13.700 --> 22:19.270
All right. My real name
isn't Willow... it's Winifred.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.439
(laughing)

22:21.441 --> 22:24.508
-Winifred...
-What are you laughing
about, Digbert?

22:25.812 --> 22:27.545
Yoga makes me angry.

22:30.183 --> 22:34.385
My middle name is...
Nah, I'm just kidding.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.721
You're never gonna find out!

22:37.623 --> 22:39.557
I watch Parker
while he's sleeping.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.927
What? He looks so peaceful.

22:44.397 --> 22:47.998
I can't believe
I'm admitting this, but...

22:48.000 --> 22:50.401
I text with Artie!

22:53.339 --> 22:56.841
Okay, what? He gives
really great advice.

22:56.843 --> 23:02.747
Okay, well, Liv, you have
thoroughly ruined that game.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.816
Um... do you want to
actually sing something,
and then maybe, Diggie,

23:05.818 --> 23:07.918
-you can strum along?
-Sure.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.620
