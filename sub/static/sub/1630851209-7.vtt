00:01.958 --> 00:04.787
My name is B. J. Novak.
I wanna tell you
about this show I made.

00:04.830 --> 00:07.181
<i>It's a completely different
episode every time.</i>

00:07.224 --> 00:08.312
- Pop culture.
- Sex.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.400
Revenge.

00:09.444 --> 00:10.445
Here it is. Is that it?

00:11.141 --> 00:12.142
That's it.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.634
What about that one?

00:25.677 --> 00:27.288
That'll do nicely. That gaggle

00:27.331 --> 00:28.985
of human flotsam doesn't even

00:29.029 --> 00:30.552
belong on the sea.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.641
Bat!

00:42.129 --> 00:44.000
Hello.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.960
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Just like on <i>Gilligan.</i>

00:48.004 --> 00:49.919
Come on!

00:49.962 --> 00:52.530
- Send us a postcard.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.706
Just the dudes!

00:54.750 --> 00:57.100
And away we go.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.757

01:31.743 --> 01:34.398
Again, we do apologize so deeply

01:34.442 --> 01:36.270
for taking up any of your time.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.446
I wish I could have
helped you with

01:38.489 --> 01:40.143
whatever this was supposed
to be about, but--

01:40.187 --> 01:41.971
Is that Count Bakula?

01:42.014 --> 01:43.842
Who's that?
- Hi, Count Bakula!

01:43.886 --> 01:45.409
- Big fan!
- No, shush!

01:45.453 --> 01:47.194
It turns out he's not even
actually a vampire.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.196
We got it wrong.
He's actually a Scoot?

01:49.239 --> 01:51.546
- He's a Scott... Bakula.
- Scott.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.939
Nadja, really, I-I need to go.
I got people in the pool--

01:53.983 --> 01:56.028
Yes, you must go.
Thank you so much.
But before you do,

01:56.072 --> 01:57.421
eh, Count Bakula,
could I just ask,

01:57.465 --> 01:59.075
did you ever have an ancestral

01:59.119 --> 02:01.338
home in the Transylvania area?

02:01.382 --> 02:02.905
Not that I'm aware of.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.689
Uh, we're all here
in Sherman Oaks.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.039
Oh, is that near Bucharest?

02:07.083 --> 02:10.173
No, it's between Mulholland
and, uh, and-and the Galleria.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.175
I do apologize for my associate.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.134
He is demented.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.266
Nandor and I have come
to a better agreement

02:16.310 --> 02:18.573
on how to run
the Vampiric Council together.

02:18.616 --> 02:21.967
- Which is a--
- A diplomatic solution,
whereby--

02:22.011 --> 02:24.796
Which is that we will each
be running the council...

02:24.840 --> 02:26.711
On alternating days.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.887
<i>It's a terrible solution.</i>

02:28.931 --> 02:30.933
Every day is spent undoing
what the other one did

02:30.976 --> 02:32.239
on the previous day.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.893
We are two,
but we work as... one.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.112
One.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.592
I said say it together.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.289
<i>This is the most poorly run</i>

02:39.333 --> 02:40.682
<i>Vampiric Council</i>

02:40.725 --> 02:42.336
since the rule
of Paduk the Deranged.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.164
<i>Who also tried to share
his leadership duties</i>

02:44.207 --> 02:46.557
<i>with what he believed to be
was a talking footstool.</i>

02:46.601 --> 02:48.298
But we even had good days
with him.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.865
There are no good days
with these two.

02:49.908 --> 02:52.041
This is ultimately
what power-sharing

02:52.084 --> 02:54.565
and coexistence is all about.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.959
A real
- Israel/
- Palestine situation.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.266
Yes, a win-win.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.184
- Nandor!
Yes?

03:04.227 --> 03:05.576
Here we go again.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.056
What?
- Nandor!

03:07.099 --> 03:08.666
Ah, there you are!

03:08.710 --> 03:10.451
- I've been looking everywhere.
- Not now, darling.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.366
- I need a moment.
- Could you possibly
pick me up and--?

03:12.409 --> 03:13.454
Busy.
- I'm going to peel
the skin off your scrotum

03:13.497 --> 03:15.020
and chew it like a gum!

03:15.064 --> 03:17.153
What is this?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.329
This is an agreement
for our Vampiric Council

03:19.373 --> 03:21.201
of the Tristate Area-- VCOTSA!

03:21.244 --> 03:23.333
To be the proud sponsors
of the upcoming

03:23.377 --> 03:25.248
- Fun Run for MS.
Yes.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.381
- And you think this is
a good idea why?
Nadja!

03:27.424 --> 03:29.687
It is a good idea
because it is good

03:29.731 --> 03:31.689
that humans are healthy.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.083
Healthier humans mean
healthier eating choices for us.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.607
Pick me up, please!
- Not now, darling!

03:36.651 --> 03:38.261
- Please!
Shoo, little one.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.958
And so we are going
to announce to the world

03:40.002 --> 03:42.352
on the back of T-shirts,
"Proudly sponsored

03:42.396 --> 03:44.659
-"by the vampires
that live amongst you..."
- Pay attention to me!

03:44.702 --> 03:46.530
-"...that you're not supposed
to know about"?
- Yoo-hoo.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.576
- Ay!
- I am undoing this.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.230
- It will be undone.
Hello?

03:50.273 --> 03:51.753
Undo nothing!

03:51.796 --> 03:53.494
I will put
a temporary stop-work order

03:53.537 --> 03:55.017
on the proposed undoing.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.237
No one will even notice.
It's gonna be like...

03:57.280 --> 03:59.674
"Sponsored by Wells Fargo,

03:59.717 --> 04:01.197
- Jersey Mike's Sub Shop..."

04:01.241 --> 04:02.981
-"...VCOTSA."

04:03.025 --> 04:05.593
Sometimes I feel like I've
become invisible to everyone.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.421
And that hurts, you know?

04:07.464 --> 04:09.031
Wow, so...

04:09.074 --> 04:10.946
this is what we're doing now?

04:10.989 --> 04:14.166
Just gonna pair Guillermo
with the doll for interviews?

04:14.210 --> 04:16.299
That's wh--
that's where we're going?

04:16.343 --> 04:18.301
Really, just get
all the B-team interviews

04:18.345 --> 04:20.129
done at the same time?

04:20.172 --> 04:21.565
Nice, real nice, guys.

04:21.609 --> 04:22.914
Oh, boo-fucking-hoo!

04:22.958 --> 04:25.265
My legs are
five centimeters long.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.962
Looks like you guys have
things covered here.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.790
I have chores to do.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.748
- Do you need help?
- No, I got it.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.055
- Oy.
Guillermo, come on.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.623
<i>He's</i> a chore, am I right?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.843
Now I'm guessing
you're wondering

04:38.887 --> 04:40.758
why are those fellas
on this boat?

04:40.802 --> 04:43.761
We're actually on our way
to a place called Plum Island.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.198
<i>Colin Robinson believes
that Plum Island</i>

04:46.242 --> 04:48.723
<i>holds the secrets
to his energy vampire</i>

04:48.766 --> 04:50.290
<i>origins.</i>

04:50.333 --> 04:52.335
<i>It's owned by the government.</i>

04:52.379 --> 04:54.729
<i>It's an animal disease
research center.</i>

04:54.772 --> 04:56.687
<i>Off-limits to average Joes</i>

04:56.731 --> 04:58.210
and likely highly guarded.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.603
Centuries ago...

04:59.647 --> 05:01.910
<i>I commanded the captain's helm</i>

05:01.953 --> 05:03.564
<i>of many an important vessel.</i>

05:03.607 --> 05:06.088
<i>I began my seafaring life
as a...</i>

05:06.131 --> 05:08.482
<i>young sailor scrubbing
the poop decks--</i>

05:08.525 --> 05:11.049
Poop decks.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.486
That's what it's called.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.183
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:14.226 --> 05:17.055
<i>And from there I was
in charge of sloops,</i>

05:17.099 --> 05:18.883
<i>battleships, brigantines,</i>

05:18.927 --> 05:20.363
<i>the</i> Titanic <i>for two seconds.</i>

05:20.407 --> 05:21.712
<i>You name it, I sailed it.</i>

05:23.105 --> 05:24.759
What the fuck?!

05:24.802 --> 05:26.761
- Just hit the--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.545
Sorry.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.417
Yeah, that's loud.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.550
<i>You know, being a ghost spirit</i>

05:33.594 --> 05:36.118
in a doll body has been
a complicated experience.

05:36.161 --> 05:39.469
But I've made
some good memories here.

05:39.513 --> 05:42.124
Yes...

05:42.167 --> 05:45.823
Remember that chopping someone's
head off is an absolute last

05:45.867 --> 05:47.564
- resort.
- Yeah, okay.

05:51.046 --> 05:54.789
Which, in turn, causes
an uneven wear pattern.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.921
- Mm-hmm.
- And that is why you were

05:56.965 --> 05:58.880
walking weird last week.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.535
- You'll be walking weird
if you don't shut up.
- Absolutely.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.581
♪ <i>Vampires are a happy folk</i>♪

06:04.625 --> 06:07.932
♪ <i>They share a laugh,
they share a joke♪</i>

06:10.500 --> 06:12.720
Oh, Nandor!

06:12.763 --> 06:14.548
Shit.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.376
- She's pretty good. Hey!
- I'll kill you! Aah!

06:16.419 --> 06:18.552
- Nandor, I'll fucking kill you!
- Whoa, no-- hey, Nadja!

06:18.595 --> 06:20.597
But as time has passed,
I have realized

06:20.641 --> 06:22.425
I don't fit here.

06:22.469 --> 06:25.167
Perhaps I'm that one extra piece
leftover when a puzzle is

06:25.210 --> 06:28.257
already completed and there is
no place where it fits.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.607
Which is not how a puzzle works,
of course.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.869
But who gives a shit?

06:31.913 --> 06:33.654
That is how I feel.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.438
I'm the extra puzzle piece.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.874
Okay.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.486
Let's hit the road.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.966
Honestly, Nandor, I don't want

06:42.010 --> 06:43.794
to sample virgin dogs.
We've already tried that before.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.448
It doesn't work.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.015
It will be undone.
-"Vampire ice cream"?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.364
It's just cold blood.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.887
We can put blood in the fridge.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.498
We don't need to do
vampire ice cream.

06:51.541 --> 06:52.716
- Nadja? Hello?
- Undo it.
- It will be undone.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.935
I'm leaving now.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.458
More portraits of Nandor?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.068
Undo that. No, we've
got enough portraits...

06:57.112 --> 06:59.288
Okay, then, I guess
I'll just be moving along.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.811
Vampire carnival?!

07:00.855 --> 07:03.161
I mean, we are a secret species.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.209
When I was a captain,
life was the best.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.429
<i>I knew a thousand sea shanties,</i>

07:09.472 --> 07:11.605
<i>I was nut-deep in prostitutes,</i>

07:11.648 --> 07:13.737
<i>sword fights every other day,</i>

07:13.781 --> 07:16.523
as much gold as you could shake
a shitty stick...

07:16.566 --> 07:19.221
What the fuck are you doing?
It's dark!

07:19.264 --> 07:21.658
I-I know, it feels good, though.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.095
- Hey, can you get my back?
- Uh...

07:24.139 --> 07:25.706
maybe I'll do that later.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.104
What is this song?

07:33.148 --> 07:35.150
It-It's haunting, yet...

07:35.193 --> 07:36.847
so familiar, I...

07:36.891 --> 07:40.068
And yet like nothing
I've heard before.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.809
Kill the engine!
Kill the engine!

07:41.852 --> 07:43.724
And the radio!

07:43.767 --> 07:46.378
I think it's coming
from over there!

07:46.422 --> 07:48.511
Coming from the starboard bow.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.644
We should investigate!

07:50.687 --> 07:52.950
Well, we got to. I don't
see what else we can do.

07:52.994 --> 07:56.171
- Okay, shall do! Okay, let's go.
- Haul ass!

07:57.389 --> 07:59.783
No, I'm... I'm starting to think

07:59.827 --> 08:02.090
- it could be a trap.
- I was just thinking that.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.440
It definitely seems
like some sort of trap

08:04.484 --> 08:06.486
- we probably shouldn't, uh--

08:06.529 --> 08:08.357
Ooh, ooh!

08:08.400 --> 08:11.534
No, I think we should
definitely investigate.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.015
- Haul ass, smoke
grass, let's go!
- You got it.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.756
Ha-ha!

08:15.799 --> 08:18.106
- Whoa! How about that?
- Where's my tie?
Where's my tie?!

08:23.677 --> 08:25.026
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

08:25.069 --> 08:27.332
Oh, Nandor! Oh, Nandor, help!

08:27.376 --> 08:29.726
- What? What?
- Help me, somebody! I can't--

08:29.770 --> 08:31.554
Oh, no!

08:31.598 --> 08:33.643
- What is it? What the--?
- She's gone!

08:33.687 --> 08:35.645
- Who?!
- My baby dolly!

08:35.689 --> 08:37.647
She's gone! She has left home!
I can't find her!

08:37.691 --> 08:39.214
How do you know
she has left home?

08:39.257 --> 08:41.651
- Maybe she's just
under the couch.
- No!

08:41.695 --> 08:43.348
I can feel it inside my bones.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.915
It is exactly what I would do
if I wanted to make

08:44.959 --> 08:46.569
everyone worry about me
and cause a big drama.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.745
Just give her some space,
I'm sure she will come back.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.965
37 wives and you still

08:51.008 --> 08:53.141
cannot read the room when
a woman needs some attention!

08:53.184 --> 08:54.838
Come on, we have
to go and find her!

08:54.882 --> 08:56.405
- Oh, do I have to?
- Oh!

08:56.448 --> 08:57.841
I hope she is okay out there

08:57.885 --> 08:59.843
all by her small self--
you know what?

08:59.887 --> 09:02.498
If she wants to go out there,
get kidnapped

09:02.542 --> 09:05.588
by a Turkish horde of gangsters
and sold off as mincemeat,

09:05.632 --> 09:07.938
fine by me.
Rolled up, turned into kofta,

09:07.982 --> 09:10.375
then I'm fine with that.
This is all my fault.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.203
I have been neglecting her.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.423
And when I find that little...

09:14.466 --> 09:16.686
I am going to melt her head.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.297
I'm going to make a chalice out
of her face and drink from it.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.170
I will help you find her.
Guillermo!

09:22.213 --> 09:24.041
- Guillermo!
-...petty emotional drama...

09:24.085 --> 09:26.957
So is this you?
Just put it down.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.569
Handsome then,
handsome now, huh?

09:29.612 --> 09:31.571
Yes, you keep saying that
over and over...

09:31.614 --> 09:33.355
- Guillermo!
- Oh, look.
- We are leaving!

09:33.398 --> 09:35.313
Great, great, I'll come with you
because I'm your bodyguard.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.620
No, no, you will stay here
and you will search the attic

09:37.664 --> 09:39.840
for that sweet, little,
stupid bitch of a doll.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.364
If you find her, you will kiss
her, then hit her, come on!

09:42.407 --> 09:44.322
- But she said not to--
- Doesn't matter what she said.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.107
I'm dealing with a woman
who is having a heated

09:46.150 --> 09:48.109
debate with an identical
version of her own mind.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.241
Come on, I do not want
to be alone with her.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.201
Mind if I stay in your bed
for a midevening slumber?

09:53.244 --> 09:55.159
No! Get out of my room!

09:55.203 --> 09:57.509
- Get out
and don't touch anything!
- Okay.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.947
I will not touch anything.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.343
Oh, oh.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.911
- It's beautiful.
- That voice.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.434
It beckons me.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.001
Really?
'Cause I-I'm getting more

10:11.045 --> 10:13.525
of a "Colin beckoning,"
to be honest

10:17.486 --> 10:20.054
Do you have a name, my darling?

10:20.097 --> 10:21.882
Don't interrupt my song, mm.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.754
There'll be plenty of time
for applause at the end, boys.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.237
The only thing I hate more
than when someone interrupts

10:29.280 --> 10:31.848
my song is when they try
and join in.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.807
It's not right.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.725
Is it me, or is she... hideous?

10:38.768 --> 10:40.509
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.554
Nope, nothing there I want.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.034
- Let's go.
- I'm as limp as a finger.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.340
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fantastic stuff.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.558
All the best, my darling.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.430
- Toodle...
- Oh, wait!

10:48.473 --> 10:50.519
Hang on.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.134
Shit.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.527
Shit, look.

10:58.570 --> 10:59.833
Colin Robinson,

10:59.876 --> 11:02.183
we are in the presence
of a siren.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.101
Sirens are

11:07.144 --> 11:09.581
<i>creatures from Roman
and Greek mythology.</i>

11:09.625 --> 11:12.889
<i>There is a common misconception
about their appearance,</i>

11:12.933 --> 11:14.978
<i>but they actually take
many different forms,</i>

11:15.022 --> 11:18.025
<i>mainly birds that lure
unsuspecting sailors--</i>

11:18.068 --> 11:19.853
Yeah, they know
what a fucking siren is.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.245
- We just got to get out of here.
- Well, maybe they--

11:21.289 --> 11:23.770
Wait, perhaps one of my suitors

11:23.813 --> 11:26.120
would want to compete
for a shiny trinket?

11:27.599 --> 11:29.384
- Yummy.
- Or perhaps, fuck that.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.212
Bat!

11:36.652 --> 11:39.089
- That's the most beautiful song
I've ever heard.
- Yeah.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.744
Call Dick Clark, 'cause he's
gonna want her on <i>Bandstand.</i>

11:41.788 --> 11:43.441
Reckon.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.748
Where are you?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.881
- Yes, where are you?
- You silly bitch!

11:47.924 --> 11:49.883
- Where have you gone?!
- How do you know
she's even here?

11:49.926 --> 11:51.580
Because this is exactly
what I would do!

11:51.623 --> 11:53.843
I would come to some toy store
and sit on a shelf

11:53.887 --> 11:56.411
and wait for a sweet little girl
to take me home instead

11:56.454 --> 11:58.892
of living in a house with
a bunch of uncaring assholes!

11:58.935 --> 12:01.503
That is what you think of us,
a bunch of uncaring assholes?

12:01.546 --> 12:02.983
All the time? No.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.506
Sometimes? Yes!

12:04.549 --> 12:05.812
Lately? A lot!

12:05.855 --> 12:07.552
- Guillermo? Focus now.
- Sorry.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.554
You know, maybe she just
needs some love and caring

12:09.598 --> 12:11.339
and respect,
you know, the things that

12:11.382 --> 12:12.993
- are completely missing
from our house!
- Hello?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.777
- Dolly, baby! Hey, Dolly.
- Here, Dolly, Dolly, hello?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.387
- It's okay, come out.
- Where are you, my love?

12:16.431 --> 12:18.520
- Here, Dolly, Dolly...
- Nandor!

12:18.563 --> 12:20.174
- I'll kill you!

12:20.217 --> 12:21.828
You're stupid, Nandor!

12:21.871 --> 12:23.394
Aah, my fucking...

12:23.438 --> 12:25.222
- Nandor...

12:27.050 --> 12:28.965
What have you done?!

12:29.009 --> 12:30.750
My sweet baby!

12:30.793 --> 12:32.577
She is so limp and lifeless.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.928
Sorry, I thought it was
a giant bug or something.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.147
Hey, guys, look!
Leave me alone.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.019
I don't want to talk to you.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.890
Her spirit has jumped
from one body to another!

12:40.934 --> 12:43.284
[speaks foreign
language] Come home!
- Come on.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.199
Stop being so dramatic,
you stupid bitch!

12:45.242 --> 12:47.070
I love you so much!

12:47.114 --> 12:48.680
- What are you doing?
Leave me alone!

12:48.724 --> 12:50.073
That's not nice.
Goodness' sake!

12:50.117 --> 12:51.814
Oh, shit, uh...

12:51.858 --> 12:53.468
Forget about me!
- Just kick them out...

12:54.991 --> 12:56.210
- Are you okay?
- Yes!

12:56.253 --> 12:57.646
You silly cow!

12:57.689 --> 12:59.256
Guillermo,
tidy the balls, please.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.736
I love you so much!

13:05.828 --> 13:07.830
If you scoot a little
to your left,

13:07.874 --> 13:10.833
I think I can get my mouth down
to gnaw through this rope.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.705
- We're not even tied up.
- Oh.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.144
If she found out,
she'd have me for dinner

13:17.187 --> 13:18.798
and you for dessert.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.191
Well, why-why would
she eat me second?

13:21.235 --> 13:23.933
Well, you don't go to
the hog roast for the coleslaw.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.981
Oh, God, listen,
it's useless for me.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.374
Why don't you save yourself?
You can fly.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.594
I'm not gonna leave you,

- Come on.
- Now I need you

15:33.845 --> 15:35.978

with a device that'll make me

15:36.022 --> 15:38.024

Yeah, we, we can go

- Oh, wow.

Judi?

16:10.056 --> 16:12.884
Between you and I,

16:12.928 --> 16:14.364
could I really notice
a difference

16:14.408 --> 16:17.063
between 5.1 and 7.1 surround?

16:17.106 --> 16:20.196
Look, 5.1 is absolutely fine
for most standard home use.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.546
Right, but it's not 7.1.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.026
That's what you're
really saying.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.115
Well, me,
I'm a bit of an audiophile.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.291
And I have a sneaking suspicion

16:28.335 --> 16:30.598
that you might be, too,
Mr. Cravensworth.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.122
Guilty as charged.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.473
Hey, did you find everything
you were looking for today?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.649
- Yes, I did, Kevin.
- Great.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.956
Now, will this be, uh,
cash or card?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.741
I will not be paying
for anything today.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.047
Got it. No charge.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.353
Now, will you be wanting

16:46.396 --> 16:47.876
the extended warranty coverage?

16:47.919 --> 16:51.053
I won't be talked
into any extended warranty.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.577
Got it. Now if you just
punch in your email--

16:53.621 --> 16:56.537
Nor will I punching in
my email address.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.801
I won't be talked into any kind
of Best Buy membership card

16:59.844 --> 17:01.890
or charge card.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.414
Right, but we really do need

- Oh, for the Geek Squad?

- Not a problem at all.
- Okay.

phone number is-- what is it?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.256
- 718...
- Okay, yeah.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.954
Quadrophonic sound was
a great gimmick.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.000

the wider public gave a shit

17:25.044 --> 17:26.697
about that kind of detail.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.308

all these electronics

18:10.915 --> 18:13.744
You know, um, Rascal Flatts,

18:13.788 --> 18:16.486
they have a song
called "Life Is a Highway."

18:16.530 --> 18:18.880
- I don't know that song.
- And, uh,

18:18.923 --> 18:23.058
this detour tonight has
kind of changed my mind.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.886
Maybe life isn't a highway.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.844
You know,
maybe life is an ocean.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.585
- Yeah, yeah.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.109
Yes.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.633
You're an odd one,
Colin Robinson.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.635
Listen to me babbling on.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.290
- Um, Sheila...

18:37.333 --> 18:39.509
I-I think that you're something

18:39.553 --> 18:41.163
really special.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.904
Really?

18:44.166 --> 18:47.300
Most people don't like me
when I'm not singing.

18:47.343 --> 18:50.172
Most people don't like me
when I'm talking either.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.870
- Oh.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.176
I'm sorry, I got nervous.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.396
I did a little poopy on you.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.049
Nothing to be nervous about.

18:58.093 --> 19:00.051
It's not the first time

19:00.095 --> 19:02.228
a beautiful woman has
shit on my shoes.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.186
Thanks.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.840
- Probably...
- Human form!

19:05.883 --> 19:07.320
Fear not, Colin Robinson!

19:07.363 --> 19:09.800
- Oh, shit.
- A captain never abandons

19:09.844 --> 19:12.890
his crew,
so, siren, release him.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.457
- Can you give me just

19:14.501 --> 19:16.067
- one second, sweetie?
- Yeah.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.200
- Leave him alone and come on.
- Laszlo, no.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.202
- What?
- I'm in love.

19:20.246 --> 19:23.074
- I mean, she's the one.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.902
It might be
a little unconventional,

19:24.946 --> 19:28.036
but... love can't
always be explained.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.820
What, even
when she's not singing?

19:29.864 --> 19:33.389
Well, when she's singing,
I-I can't resist her, but...

19:33.433 --> 19:35.348
when she's not singing,
I don't...

19:35.391 --> 19:38.133
want to, want to resist her.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.135
Look at what she's doing.
- Yeah.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.224
He's mad.

19:44.835 --> 19:47.142
- My lovely bitch, we've got you!
- Leave me alone!

19:47.186 --> 19:49.927
There's nowhere left to run--
just give it up!

19:49.971 --> 19:52.060
Stop chasing me! Let me be free!

19:52.103 --> 19:53.714
You don't even want me!

19:53.757 --> 19:55.585
- Hey!
- What are you talking about?!

19:55.629 --> 19:57.239
- Of course we want you!
- Ooh!

19:57.283 --> 19:58.936
You're the one who ran away!

19:58.980 --> 20:01.548
- Are you fucking kidding me
with this?
- Ouch!

20:03.071 --> 20:04.638
Oopsies.

20:04.681 --> 20:07.249
What have you done?!
Oh, my love!

20:07.293 --> 20:10.339
She was only gonna jump
into another vessel anyway.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.211
I am very tired.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.082
Just let me go.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.345
It would be easier for you.

20:16.389 --> 20:19.130
You have so much to do already,
without having to worry

20:19.174 --> 20:22.264
about me and my silly emotions.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.919
Yes, I have been
very busy recently.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.530
But you have to understand.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.619
I have been working
so fucking hard

20:29.663 --> 20:31.882
in that house
to be taken seriously.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.972
To get anyone
to give me any respect.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.453
I've been trying to be
professional, but I've been

20:37.497 --> 20:41.065
squishing down
and mincing up my own...

20:41.109 --> 20:43.894
silly emotions.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.028
Oh...

20:47.071 --> 20:48.551
Oh.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.161
Wow.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.294
I am so sorry.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.904
It is not okay.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.298
And I am going
to do better for you.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.300
And for myself.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.216
I am too tired. Switching hosts

21:01.260 --> 21:03.523
is extremely draining.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.786
I don't think
I can do it anymore.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.442
How about one last home?

21:09.485 --> 21:12.401
Do you feel like coming back
and living with a bunch

21:12.445 --> 21:14.490
of uncaring assholes?

21:16.927 --> 21:19.234
Okay, why not?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.628
For what it's worth,
I also think you're doing

21:21.671 --> 21:23.934
- a great job as coleader--
Shut up.

21:23.978 --> 21:26.154
- This isn't about you.
Not even a little bit.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.678
And I'm taking the day off
tomorrow!

21:28.722 --> 21:30.463
Oh, yes, a day out!

21:30.506 --> 21:32.334
We can crush grapes and spit
all the pits at the pigeons

21:32.378 --> 21:34.293
and torture mortals...

21:34.336 --> 21:35.859
- Right.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.645
Listen to me, Colin Robinson,
she is a siren.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.299
It's her job to enchant you.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.344
You're not in love.
You may think you are,

21:42.388 --> 21:44.346
you dumb fuck, but you're not.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.348
Yeah, well, how do you know
the difference?

21:46.392 --> 21:48.916
She's half-chicken.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.483
Yeah, nobody's perfect.

21:50.526 --> 21:53.399
You go away, my friend.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.444
I'm in love.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.751
- Did you eat your dinner?
- Yeah.

21:57.794 --> 22:00.406
All right, this is going to end
badly, so what you need to do

22:00.449 --> 22:03.278
is cut the mics, turn
all the sound equipment off,

22:03.322 --> 22:05.541
and put your fingers
in your ears, and do it now.

22:05.585 --> 22:08.109
Okay. Do it.
- Now!

22:27.433 --> 22:29.391
Oh, shit.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.393
<i>How do I look?
Do I look all right?</i>

22:31.437 --> 22:33.613
- Yes, you look great.
You always look great.
- Mm-hmm.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.833
This has all made me realize
that in my efforts to be taken

22:36.877 --> 22:39.575
more seriously as a leader
of the Vampiric Council,

22:39.619 --> 22:42.186
I have been neglecting
my gorgeous, sweet,

22:42.230 --> 22:44.841
cutie, silly, little,
dolly mama-moo.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.582
Yes, exactly.

22:46.626 --> 22:49.411
And because, uh,
she is me, the same,

22:49.455 --> 22:52.414
it means I have been neglecting
the gorgeous, sweet, juicy,

22:52.458 --> 22:55.286
lovely, silly part
of my own excellent personality.

22:55.330 --> 22:58.115
And what I've realized,
since I am her,

22:58.159 --> 23:00.161
I've got to communicate
my emotional needs

23:00.204 --> 23:02.293
to everyone... and to myself.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.687
I love this little slut.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.950
And I love you, my little whore.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.430
Potty mouth, the same.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.219
Oh, hello.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.091
I say, um, apologies

23:17.134 --> 23:19.441
for not making it to Plum Island

23:19.485 --> 23:22.009
to find out more about
your energy vampire origins.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.403
Yeah, well, I-I guess

23:24.446 --> 23:26.361
I remain an enigma.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.232
Which is pretty cool.

23:28.276 --> 23:31.410
Right, has that chicken's
spell worn off?

23:31.453 --> 23:33.150
I guess.

23:33.194 --> 23:34.978
I mean, maybe I didn't
experience

23:35.022 --> 23:37.851
true love today,
but it-it-it sure felt like it.

23:37.894 --> 23:40.462
I'd say
that you didn't experience

23:40.506 --> 23:43.291
true love today.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.640
I didn't, no.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.033
All right, well, I'll leave you

23:46.076 --> 23:47.687
to whatever
the hell you were doing.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.776
Okay, then.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.920
If-if you guys could...

24:03.964 --> 24:06.053
maybe give me a-a minute?

24:06.096 --> 24:08.403
Um, I'm gonna beat off now.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.068
quite a bit
of attention.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.592
You know, more than before.
That's for sure.
