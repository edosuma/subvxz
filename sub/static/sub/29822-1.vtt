00:36.482 --> 00:37.900
<i>When I was little girl,</i>

00:37.983 --> 00:40.486
<i>Christmas Eve was my favorite night
of the year.</i>

00:52.248 --> 00:54.542
<i>I'd wait up with my brother for Santa.</i>

00:55.167 --> 00:59.004
<i>Sometimes we would fall asleep,
but I'd be dreaming of presents.</i>

00:59.880 --> 01:01.340
<i>I really love presents.</i>

01:08.931 --> 01:10.683
- Nick, he's here.
- Stop.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.393
Come on. Wake up.

01:12.476 --> 01:14.603
- No.
- Come on, come on, come on.

02:06.906 --> 02:09.574
What a jolly card.

02:09.657 --> 02:12.828
I wonder which child made this?

02:12.912 --> 02:15.456
Over here! Right here! I caught you.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.166
You did.

02:17.249 --> 02:19.043
But let's keep it between us,

02:19.126 --> 02:22.213
because my job depends
on not getting caught.

02:22.296 --> 02:23.839
Totally get it.

02:23.923 --> 02:26.842
So, I see you have some presents...

02:26.926 --> 02:29.011
Oh, I do. Um...

02:29.595 --> 02:32.556
Have you been naughty or nice this year?

02:32.640 --> 02:35.518
In my personal opinion, very nice.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.812
Well, let me check my list.

02:40.356 --> 02:41.732
Oh! Oh!

02:41.816 --> 02:43.859
Um, checking it twice.

02:46.028 --> 02:48.531
Dad!

02:48.614 --> 02:50.115
You know I'm nice.

02:50.574 --> 02:53.118
Give me a hug.

02:53.202 --> 02:55.162
Dad! You're home!

02:55.246 --> 02:56.539
Come here, my boy!

02:58.165 --> 03:01.126
Oh! Welcome home, Santa.

03:02.169 --> 03:05.756
I see Mommy kissing Santa Claus.

03:06.340 --> 03:07.800
How was your night, dear?

03:07.883 --> 03:11.011
Jolly. The presents were all delivered.

03:11.095 --> 03:12.638
Except for two.

03:23.399 --> 03:26.360
Oh, my garland. This is amazing!

03:27.778 --> 03:29.029
What'd you get, Nick?

03:34.326 --> 03:35.369
Dad?

03:35.452 --> 03:40.666
Congratulations, my boy.
It's time to start your Santa training.

03:41.792 --> 03:43.043
Try it on.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.220
I'm not sure this fits.

03:53.304 --> 03:56.015
It will fit you when you fit it.

04:02.021 --> 04:04.899
There you go. That looks jolly, Nick.

04:04.982 --> 04:07.151
And red is totally your color.

04:07.693 --> 04:09.195
Oh!

04:09.278 --> 04:12.156
That must be the elves
to welcome you home!

04:12.239 --> 04:14.867
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Jackets, everyone.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.454
Pole weather report,
snow and eight degrees.

04:18.995 --> 04:20.498
Forever.

04:20.581 --> 04:22.791
That's cold. Come on, honey.

04:24.543 --> 04:25.669
Thank you, Santa.

04:26.712 --> 04:29.507
- Merry Christmas, Polly.
- Dad?

04:29.590 --> 04:34.261
- Uh-huh?
- I was just wondering, Mom is Mrs. Claus,

04:34.345 --> 04:35.721
Polly is our nanny,

04:35.804 --> 04:38.182
someday Nick will be Santa.

04:38.766 --> 04:39.892
What do I do?

04:39.975 --> 04:42.478
Well, what do you want to do?

04:43.187 --> 04:44.897
I would like to do what you do.

04:45.606 --> 04:47.441
You mean, be Santa?

04:47.525 --> 04:49.360
No, Nick is Santa.

04:49.443 --> 04:51.946
But I would like to help decide
what toys to make,

04:52.029 --> 04:54.698
and fly the sleigh,
and do something really important.

04:56.116 --> 04:57.451
You do, Noelle.

04:57.535 --> 05:01.455
You make everyone jolly with your cards
and your Christmas cheer,

05:01.539 --> 05:04.875
and you know how much your brother
depends on you. So you can help him,

05:05.459 --> 05:08.546
and always keep his Christmas spirit up.

05:12.842 --> 05:15.845
Sure. I can do that.

05:16.428 --> 05:17.638
I'm counting on you.

05:20.683 --> 05:23.227
Merry Christmas, Noelle.

05:23.310 --> 05:26.355
Merry Christmas, Dad.

05:28.065 --> 05:31.402
<i>Now that I'm grown up, Christmas
is still my favorite time of the year.</i>

05:32.111 --> 05:34.613
<i>Although, this Christmas is a sad one.</i>

05:35.489 --> 05:39.785
<i>Dad passed away five months ago,
and I miss him every day.</i>

05:42.204 --> 05:44.790
<i>But Dad always told us
that Christmas must go on,</i>

05:44.874 --> 05:46.500
<i>especially for us Kringles,</i>

05:46.584 --> 05:48.169
<i>because for 2,000 years,</i>

05:48.252 --> 05:53.215
<i>our ancestors have been the Santas that
bring joy to children all over the world.</i>

05:53.299 --> 05:55.092
<i>And now it's my big brother's turn,</i>

05:55.176 --> 05:58.345
<i>as Nick becomes the 23rd Kringle
to wear the red hat.</i>

06:03.350 --> 06:06.103
<i>He's been practicing
his sleigh flying here in the Pole.</i>

06:06.187 --> 06:08.314
Am I supposed to land on the house?

06:10.566 --> 06:12.651
Slow down! Slow down! No, no, no!

06:17.573 --> 06:19.033
We can work with that, right?

06:21.494 --> 06:24.622
<i>Believe it or not,
that's actually an improvement.</i>

06:27.374 --> 06:30.211
<i>Everyone's been working super hard
to help him get ready,</i>

06:31.587 --> 06:34.131
- <i>including Mother.</i>
- Well, dear, that was, um...

06:34.215 --> 06:35.591
Well, you know.

06:35.674 --> 06:37.927
<i>And Santa's Helpers are singing...</i>

06:38.010 --> 06:39.678
<i>Crashing all the way
Ha, ha, ha!</i>

06:39.762 --> 06:43.265
<i>My geeky cousin, Gabe,
and his Tech Elves are doing something.</i>

06:43.349 --> 06:44.350
<i>I don't know.</i>

06:44.433 --> 06:47.394
- <i>They're really excited about it.</i>
- Oh, my God! We did it!

06:48.103 --> 06:51.690
<i>And as for me, I'm still making
my cards and spreading Christmas cheer,</i>

06:51.774 --> 06:53.442
<i>just like Dad told me to.</i>

06:53.526 --> 06:56.821
<i>I don't know what everyone
would do without me.</i>

07:22.930 --> 07:25.975
Yo! Snowcone! Dude!

07:29.645 --> 07:30.646
Oh!

07:30.729 --> 07:34.567
Yes, who's my hyperactive little reindeer?
You are! Oh! You got it.

07:34.650 --> 07:37.611
What do we think?

07:38.612 --> 07:42.241
"Merry Christmas.
What are you getting this year?"

07:44.368 --> 07:48.747
I know, it totally captures the essence
of Christmas, getting the perfect present.

07:50.958 --> 07:52.626
- Noelle!
- Mmm.

07:54.879 --> 07:56.088
Morning, princess.

07:56.172 --> 07:57.882
Thank you, but I don't want breakfast.

07:57.965 --> 07:59.383
- Yes, you do.
- I'm very busy.

07:59.466 --> 08:04.221
I have been out in the forest,
chopping firewood, carting it on my back,

08:04.305 --> 08:07.391
so that I could heat up the cottage
and make your breakfast waffles,

08:07.474 --> 08:11.061
while I picked up all the dirty clothes,
but none of that's really been a problem.

08:12.271 --> 08:14.857
I don't need you to do
any of that stuff. Honestly.

08:15.441 --> 08:17.902
You would starve and die
if it weren't for me.

08:17.985 --> 08:20.863
That's what you think.
Oh, my garland. This is delicious.

08:22.323 --> 08:24.492
Oh, my partridge-in-a-pear-tree underwear
needs washing.

08:24.575 --> 08:27.328
Oh, well, then my Christmas wish
has been granted.

08:35.503 --> 08:36.504
Hmm.

08:44.260 --> 08:46.013
Come on, Snowy. I'll race you.

08:46.472 --> 08:47.473
Whoo!

09:04.406 --> 09:06.617
Puffins, scatter!

09:06.700 --> 09:07.827
Sorry, guys!

09:22.591 --> 09:25.219
Noelle! Elf Carol. <i>Daily Carol.</i>

09:25.302 --> 09:28.305
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- I'm all earmuffs. Fire away.

09:28.889 --> 09:31.725
We know it's been a whirlwind preparation
since your father,

09:31.809 --> 09:34.812
and our dearly beloved Santa Nicholas,
passed away.

09:34.895 --> 09:36.272
How is your brother doing?

09:36.355 --> 09:38.649
So jolly. We're all very proud of him.

09:38.732 --> 09:42.278
And the big question is:
will he be ready by Christmas?

09:42.361 --> 09:44.488
Of course! He's a Kringle.

09:45.114 --> 09:46.657
- Under. Under.
- Ah! Okay.

09:47.241 --> 09:50.161
Under your tongue.
All right. There you go. Ooh!

09:50.744 --> 09:53.706
Santa, I got you a new scarf.

09:53.789 --> 09:56.458
And check this out.
<i>Three Weeks To A Jelly Belly...</i>

09:56.542 --> 09:58.043
What happened? Mother!

09:58.127 --> 09:59.128
Santa, I thought

09:59.211 --> 10:00.880
you were at sleigh practice.

10:01.297 --> 10:03.507
<i>Santa tried to land again</i>

10:03.591 --> 10:05.801
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

10:05.885 --> 10:08.554
<i>He missed the roof and hit the den</i>

10:08.637 --> 10:10.931
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

10:11.015 --> 10:13.184
Thank you, Santa's Helpers.

10:13.267 --> 10:16.479
It was a horrible example of what can
go wrong when you're using, well,

10:16.562 --> 10:18.022
outdated technology.

10:18.105 --> 10:20.357
- After Cousin Nick crashed, the...
- Oh!

10:20.441 --> 10:23.235
I'm sorry. Did you just refer to him
as Cousin Nick?

10:23.819 --> 10:26.113
Shouldn't you be
calling my big brother "Santa"?

10:26.197 --> 10:29.575
Oh, I'm sorry. I just thought
that since we were all family, that...

10:29.658 --> 10:32.453
Well, he's Santa to you,
he's Santa to everyone.

10:32.536 --> 10:34.038
He's even Santa to himself.

10:34.121 --> 10:36.624
Well, actually, I'm pretty informal
when I'm alone.

10:36.707 --> 10:38.042
I'm just Nick.

10:38.959 --> 10:41.670
Alone. That's a jolly idea.

10:41.754 --> 10:45.758
Why don't we all just give Santa a moment.

10:48.427 --> 10:49.637
Okay.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.388
Excuse me, Gabe.

10:53.474 --> 10:56.977
This is not going well at all, dear.

10:58.062 --> 10:59.980
Dasher nearly broke an antler.

11:00.064 --> 11:04.485
And we're way, way behind schedule
at the workshop.

11:04.568 --> 11:07.947
You need to do your job and give
your brother some Christmas spirit,

11:08.030 --> 11:10.741
or else we're not gonna be ready
for Christmas.

11:16.205 --> 11:17.498
Oh, this is heavy.

11:18.123 --> 11:20.668
<i>The Book of Santa.</i>
I've read it. I've memorized it.

11:20.751 --> 11:23.212
I've listened to it on tape.
I just don't get it.

11:23.295 --> 11:26.966
Okay. Well, we are gonna read it together
and we're gonna figure this out.

11:27.508 --> 11:28.717
Let's start at the top.

11:28.801 --> 11:31.971
The top is chimney access,
that's funny.

11:32.054 --> 11:36.141
"The chimney will expand when you tap
three times with the magical candy cane

11:36.225 --> 11:38.644
"and sing the first line
of <i>We Wish You A Merry Christmas,</i>

11:38.727 --> 11:40.312
"assuming that you stay in key."

11:40.396 --> 11:41.772
- Hold your reindeer.
- Yeah.

11:41.856 --> 11:46.610
How am I supposed to know which is
the right present to give each child?

11:46.694 --> 11:48.988
If I haven't determined
who's naughty or nice,

11:49.071 --> 11:50.614
how can I pick their present?

11:51.448 --> 11:53.409
You see, it's kind of a vicious circle.

11:54.869 --> 11:55.870
Okay.

11:55.953 --> 11:59.498
This is the list. It's filled with names.
Some are nice and some are naughty.

11:59.582 --> 12:01.500
Some of the names
haven't been filled in yet,

12:01.584 --> 12:03.460
and that's gonna be your job, okay?

12:03.544 --> 12:06.088
Dad said, "It's not about
what the kid looks like.

12:06.172 --> 12:07.965
"It's what's on the inside
that's important.

12:08.048 --> 12:09.800
"You need to connect with their heart."

12:10.384 --> 12:13.304
Oh, I love that.
How's that done?

12:13.387 --> 12:15.806
I have no idea.
Just focus really hard, I guess?

12:16.390 --> 12:17.766
Okay.

12:17.850 --> 12:20.269
Uh... Nice.

12:20.853 --> 12:23.355
She cheated on every math test
she ever took.

12:25.232 --> 12:28.152
That's a... stocking full of coal
if ever I've seen one.

12:28.235 --> 12:30.112
Yeah. He saved a kitten from a tree,

12:30.196 --> 12:32.823
after visiting his grandmother
in the nursing home.

12:32.907 --> 12:34.200
So, nice?

12:34.783 --> 12:38.078
Okay, we need to figure out what people
want for Christmas. Here we go.

12:40.039 --> 12:42.208
- Football tickets.
- iPad.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.877
Really think about this next one.
Take your time.

12:46.545 --> 12:48.547
She looks like
she likes playing guitar,

12:49.131 --> 12:51.175
and that looks like, uh, an old guitar.

12:51.258 --> 12:52.760
So, I'm gonna say, um...

12:56.138 --> 12:58.349
- New guitar?
- iPad.

13:00.017 --> 13:01.185
You can do this.

13:01.268 --> 13:02.978
- iPad?
- Polly!

13:03.062 --> 13:05.439
- Okay, let's say I'm in Germany.
- Yeah.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.526
A child wakes up, wants to talk to me,
I don't speak their language.

13:08.609 --> 13:11.570
Yeah, but, um,
Santa understands all languages.

13:11.654 --> 13:14.740
And so do you.
I saw you speaking Arabic to Elf Tippy.

13:14.824 --> 13:16.867
Yeah, but that's because Gabe showed me

13:16.951 --> 13:19.411
how to use this thing
called Google Translate.

13:22.081 --> 13:25.334
Okay, Nick, I know
you're scared of the reindeer,

13:25.417 --> 13:28.796
but you need to Santa up.
You've gotta show them who's boss.

13:28.879 --> 13:31.924
"Grip the reins with both hands
while firmly saying 'On Dasher!'"

13:36.512 --> 13:38.597
Grip, command.

13:38.681 --> 13:40.516
Can't treat them like your cuddly pets.

13:40.599 --> 13:42.434
You're almost in.
Look how good you're doing!

13:42.518 --> 13:43.686
I don't wanna do this. No!

13:43.769 --> 13:45.688
- This is great! Let it happen!
- No!

13:45.771 --> 13:48.983
No!

13:49.066 --> 13:51.318
Great job, buddy. That looked great.

13:51.402 --> 13:52.987
- You okay?
- No!

13:55.739 --> 13:57.950
Ugh.

14:01.203 --> 14:02.496
All right.

14:02.580 --> 14:06.125
- Two double hot chocolates.
- Great.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.711
One with extra whipped cream.

14:11.005 --> 14:13.382
And... peppermint.

14:14.884 --> 14:17.553
Thank garland for hot chocolate
and peppermint.

14:18.262 --> 14:19.722
Mmm.

14:20.556 --> 14:23.642
I feel like I've been shivering
my whole life, you know?

14:24.351 --> 14:28.105
Sometimes, I... I dream about getting out
and finding someplace warm,

14:28.189 --> 14:31.442
where I can stretch and relax
and just breathe, you know?

14:31.525 --> 14:33.235
- Then you should.
- How?

14:33.819 --> 14:37.406
I'm Santa. I don't get a vacation.
I don't even get Christmas off.

14:37.490 --> 14:39.992
You can't be Santa
if you're having a nervous breakdown.

14:40.075 --> 14:42.912
Nobody wants you sliding into
their fireplace crying and weeping.

14:42.995 --> 14:44.163
Nothing merry about that.

14:44.246 --> 14:46.373
Can't go down chimneys.
I'm claustrophobic.

14:46.916 --> 14:49.502
You remember those magazines
Dad used to bring me on Christmas?

14:49.585 --> 14:52.379
Yeah, like <i>People?</i> That's how I found out
Jennifer Aniston's nice.

14:52.463 --> 14:55.633
Yeah.
<i>Travel And Leisure</i> had those sections

14:55.716 --> 14:57.343
about the perfect Christmas getaway.

14:57.426 --> 14:59.970
Warm weather, swimming pools,
sun-kissed mountains.

15:00.596 --> 15:05.017
You need to look in that magazine,
pick a place, get away for the weekend.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.728
Bring me back some issues
while you're down there.

15:16.487 --> 15:18.614
Ah! Cousin Gabe.

15:19.824 --> 15:20.825
Hello.

15:21.408 --> 15:24.495
I wanted to install GPS
and USB-C portals on the sleigh,

15:24.578 --> 15:28.582
and was wondering if you knew
where Cousin... Santa, you know, was.

15:28.666 --> 15:32.336
I think he probably took the sleigh
for a practice flight.

15:32.878 --> 15:36.173
Well, the sleigh came back,
and all the reindeer are here,

15:36.715 --> 15:38.050
but there's no Santa.

15:40.177 --> 15:44.181
Well, it's not like him to just leave.

15:44.265 --> 15:46.475
What's with all these magazines?

15:46.559 --> 15:51.230
<i>"InStyle, Travel and Leisure,
Martha Stewart's Living."</i>

15:53.607 --> 15:56.110
Um, I was helping Santa train,

15:56.193 --> 15:59.405
and he seemed a little overwhelmed.
So I mentioned, almost as a joke...

15:59.488 --> 16:01.073
Ho, ho, ho.

16:01.157 --> 16:03.576
That he should go somewhere
and relax for the weekend.

16:04.660 --> 16:07.997
And maybe bring back some new magazines.
That's probably what that's about.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.915
But they're for all of us to enjoy.

16:10.624 --> 16:11.709
It's not just for me.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.463
But you guys seem mad.

16:16.547 --> 16:19.341
I hope he's okay!

16:20.134 --> 16:21.135
Where is he?

16:23.846 --> 16:25.347
When was the last time you saw him?

16:25.431 --> 16:26.724
Seven days and counting.

16:28.434 --> 16:29.518
It's Noelle's fault.

16:29.602 --> 16:31.270
What's gonna happen with Christmas?

16:31.353 --> 16:33.481
- I hope it's okay.
- What happened to him?

16:33.564 --> 16:35.316
This never happened before.

16:35.399 --> 16:37.318
- Quiet.
- Where is he?

16:38.736 --> 16:41.197
Quiet!

16:42.490 --> 16:44.116
Silent night.

16:49.246 --> 16:51.999
For the first time in 2,000 years,

16:53.375 --> 16:55.211
a Santa has disappeared.

16:55.294 --> 16:57.129
At the urging of his sister, Noelle.

16:57.213 --> 16:58.964
I just said he should take
the weekend off.

16:59.048 --> 17:01.550
You put Christmas in jeopardy, young lady.

17:01.634 --> 17:03.802
- She did.
- That's so naughty.

17:04.386 --> 17:06.347
Rest ye, merry gentlemen.

17:06.430 --> 17:11.602
As Christmas is just six days away,
we must have a new Santa.

17:11.685 --> 17:14.438
Wait. What about a rescue mission?

17:14.521 --> 17:17.817
My brother could be hurt.
He might've fallen out of the sleigh.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.902
No one but Santa has ever left the Pole.

17:19.984 --> 17:22.112
And we have no idea where Santa is.

17:22.195 --> 17:25.366
We could lose the sleigh or the reindeer.
Then there'd be no Christmas.

17:25.449 --> 17:29.119
- No Christmas?
- A rescue attempt is far too dangerous.

17:30.204 --> 17:33.916
Leaving me no choice but to call upon...

17:35.042 --> 17:36.210
Gabriel Kringle.

17:36.293 --> 17:38.128
- Gabriel?
- Me?

17:38.212 --> 17:39.964
Please, approach the council.

17:40.714 --> 17:44.051
But I'm in the Tech department.
And loving it.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.594
Nevertheless, you must approach

17:45.678 --> 17:48.389
because we must select
the next adult male Kringle

17:48.472 --> 17:50.224
as specified by the Christmas covenant.

17:50.307 --> 17:52.852
That's not exactly what it says...

17:52.935 --> 17:54.186
They're elder elves.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.689
- They know what they're talking about.
- Please.

18:08.784 --> 18:09.785
Gabe.

18:10.911 --> 18:16.792
By order of the council,
the pom-pom now rests upon your head.

18:17.751 --> 18:19.420
- Really?
- Seriously?

18:19.503 --> 18:21.297
I don't know about this guy.

18:34.477 --> 18:36.854
Noelle, why did you
tell your brother to leave?

18:36.937 --> 18:38.564
I thought he would come back.

18:38.647 --> 18:41.233
You didn't think about
how he listens to you,

18:41.317 --> 18:46.280
and how your advice affected Christmas
and all of the children in the world.

18:46.363 --> 18:48.199
I just said, "Take the weekend."

18:48.282 --> 18:50.951
- She had one job.
- To look after her brother.

18:51.035 --> 18:54.038
What a princess.

18:56.290 --> 18:57.917
I just said, go for the weekend.

19:15.935 --> 19:18.938
Oh, Serge, hot chocolate,
double whip cream, and peppermint,

19:19.021 --> 19:20.189
in honor of my brother?

19:20.856 --> 19:25.069
We're all booked up.
Maybe try back in... July.

19:26.362 --> 19:28.239
Oh, okay.

19:32.284 --> 19:35.788
It can't possibly be that much.
What about my Kringle discount?

19:36.372 --> 19:39.375
That's only for Santa's immediate family,
not cousins.

20:01.856 --> 20:03.399
I want it shut.

20:03.482 --> 20:07.945
It's been shut, which is why
this room smells like old stockings.

20:08.445 --> 20:09.697
Uh...

20:10.281 --> 20:15.411
Mother's furious, and everybody hates me
because I've ruined Christmas.

20:15.494 --> 20:17.538
And I don't know if my brother's okay.

20:18.330 --> 20:19.582
What do you want from me?

20:20.166 --> 20:22.793
Stockings, sheets, and pillow cases.

20:22.877 --> 20:24.211
Ho, ho... Ow!

20:25.504 --> 20:28.007
Princess, for once in your life,

20:28.591 --> 20:30.384
try cleaning up your own mess.

20:30.467 --> 20:31.927
How do you suggest I do that?

20:34.763 --> 20:38.100
"Take a journey to a better you."

20:38.893 --> 20:41.437
Ugh. Glitter all over the floor.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.814
And stop eating waffles in bed.

20:55.451 --> 20:57.161
Hot chocolate and peppermint.

20:58.412 --> 20:59.622
Nick.

21:02.875 --> 21:06.086
Maui and San Juan.
What's between Maui and San Juan?

21:11.383 --> 21:12.635
"Phoenix."

21:14.470 --> 21:15.846
Phoenix, Arizona.

21:34.698 --> 21:37.910
Princess, do you mind telling me
what you're doing?

21:38.744 --> 21:41.455
I'm going to get my brother,
and you're coming with me.

21:42.832 --> 21:44.708
No, I'm not.

21:45.292 --> 21:49.505
Your mother will not be jolly with this,
and it is my job to keep you safe.

21:49.588 --> 21:51.298
I left her a card explaining everything,

21:51.382 --> 21:54.301
and you can't keep me safe
if you're here and I'm in Phoenix.

21:54.385 --> 21:57.096
Phoenix? That sounds horrible.

22:00.516 --> 22:02.017
Oh, hey, little guy.

22:02.101 --> 22:03.936
Uh, I've gotta go away.

22:06.438 --> 22:09.024
I know you wanna be on the team,
you're just not ready yet.

22:09.108 --> 22:10.609
So keep practicing, okay?

22:13.237 --> 22:15.072
Okay.

22:18.284 --> 22:20.619
Yes, I know. I'm going to get him.

22:21.370 --> 22:23.831
- Princess, get out of here.
- No.

22:23.914 --> 22:26.542
Listen, you've never been
out of the North Pole.

22:26.625 --> 22:29.211
- Polly.
- You do not know how to fly this sleigh.

22:29.295 --> 22:31.130
Fine. Then it'll all be on Dasher.

22:57.948 --> 22:59.241
Turn this thing around.

22:59.325 --> 23:02.828
No. Not going back without my brother.
And it's your job to help me.

23:05.581 --> 23:07.458
<i>Destination, Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

24:16.944 --> 24:20.072
I guess this is their village.
Where is everybody?

24:22.324 --> 24:25.161
- What do you think you doin'?
- Hi. I'm Noelle.

24:25.244 --> 24:26.662
Stay right where you are.

24:27.246 --> 24:29.081
We are looking for Santa Claus.

24:30.457 --> 24:32.084
<i>You've got presents.</i>

24:32.626 --> 24:34.503
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

24:34.587 --> 24:35.796
Feliz Navidad!

24:35.880 --> 24:41.093
How are you planning on having Christmas
without the reindeer and the sleigh?

24:41.177 --> 24:43.053
- Noelle took the reindeer?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:43.137 --> 24:44.889
- And the sleigh?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:45.806 --> 24:46.807
Huh...

24:47.391 --> 24:48.976
That's so interesting.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.522
What if not having the sleigh
or the reindeer is a blessing in disguise?

24:53.606 --> 24:54.690
I don't think so.

24:54.773 --> 24:58.903
This could be the perfect time
to start an online delivery platform.

24:58.986 --> 25:01.947
- I don't think so.
- What if the reindeer have Lyme disease?

25:02.031 --> 25:04.200
What if an asteroid
crashes into the sleigh?

25:04.283 --> 25:06.577
These are real concerns,
statistically speaking,

25:06.660 --> 25:08.412
and I think our customers deserve better.

25:08.496 --> 25:11.624
We don't have customers.

25:11.707 --> 25:18.130
We have children who need the magic
of a Santa coming down the chimney

25:18.214 --> 25:23.511
and arranging each present
with love and care under the tree.

25:24.094 --> 25:25.804
Okay, well, now you sound
like a crazy person.

25:26.388 --> 25:32.144
Gabe, aren't you even worried about
your cousins, Nick and Noelle, and Polly?

25:32.228 --> 25:35.314
Who knows what terrible things
have happened to them?

25:44.240 --> 25:48.160
Uh, hi, thank you, yes, I...
My name is Helen Rojas,

25:48.244 --> 25:50.204
I'm the manager
of the Desert Ridge Marketplace.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.872
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

25:51.956 --> 25:55.751
Uh, you cannot perform or solicit here
on these grounds without a permit.

25:55.835 --> 25:58.337
Can you stop, please? Or I will have to
have you arrested.

25:58.420 --> 25:59.547
Can you... This is my desk.

25:59.630 --> 26:01.799
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, thank you.

26:01.882 --> 26:02.883
- Here, I have a...
- Oh!

26:02.967 --> 26:04.468
Yes, thank you. Mmm-hmm.

26:05.052 --> 26:07.596
Okay, now, uh...

26:07.680 --> 26:09.431
Where were we? Um, arrested.

26:09.515 --> 26:12.434
Okay, that sounds bad, but can you
just tell me, have you seen this man?

26:13.352 --> 26:14.395
- Santa?
- Yeah.

26:14.478 --> 26:16.564
He looks nice and polite,
so I haven't dated him.

26:16.647 --> 26:17.648
Listen, miss,

26:17.731 --> 26:21.402
this isn't the first time someone's tried
this kind of promotional stunt.

26:21.485 --> 26:24.363
About two months ago, we had a guy
with a sleigh and a reindeer

26:24.446 --> 26:26.991
- show up outside of Chase Field...
- That's him!

26:27.074 --> 26:28.993
That's who I'm looking for.
Where did he go?

26:29.076 --> 26:30.077
The North Pole.

26:30.161 --> 26:33.205
Now, vacate the premises
or I'll have to call the police...

26:33.289 --> 26:34.707
- Hey, Helen.
- Oh, yes.

26:34.790 --> 26:37.418
Was it your idea to bring that sleigh
and reindeer in here?

26:37.501 --> 26:39.503
Uh, yes, Dan. I'm dealing with it...

26:39.587 --> 26:42.715
People are rushing into my Petco
trying to find reindeer food.

26:42.798 --> 26:45.009
We don't have any,
so I just relabeled the birdseed.

26:45.092 --> 26:46.594
They love birdseed.

26:46.677 --> 26:48.762
This is going to be
our best Christmas yet.

26:48.846 --> 26:50.139
You'll probably get a raise.

26:50.222 --> 26:52.308
You might finally get to
take that trip to Hawaii.

26:53.058 --> 26:55.519
Gosh, I'd love to go myself one day.

27:00.774 --> 27:02.193
I've never tried this before,

27:02.276 --> 27:04.236
so I don't know
if I'm gonna do it right, but...

27:04.320 --> 27:06.197
Ooh.

27:06.280 --> 27:09.074
Can you not do that, please? Thank you.

27:09.158 --> 27:10.576
Did I do it wrong?

27:10.659 --> 27:14.246
This release form protects
Desert Ridge Marketplace

27:14.330 --> 27:17.583
from any liabilities
as a result of your presence.

27:20.294 --> 27:21.670
Thank you.

27:21.754 --> 27:24.507
Oh, Helen, which way is Phoenix?

27:26.050 --> 27:28.427
Okay. Let's go find my brother.

27:28.511 --> 27:29.637
Hold on.

27:30.262 --> 27:33.432
Someone has to stay
and keep an eye on Dasher and company.

27:33.516 --> 27:37.186
They're used to a strict regimen
of North Pole hay and training.

27:37.269 --> 27:40.731
So, who knows what will happen
when they're faced with temptation?

27:41.398 --> 27:44.026
So, you want me to go out there alone?

27:44.109 --> 27:47.822
Noelle, you go out there and you be merry,

27:48.489 --> 27:53.077
and you don't tell anybody who you are
or where you came from.

27:53.619 --> 27:56.539
And always be ready to run away.

28:18.602 --> 28:21.147
- I hate you.
- No! I am done talking with you about...

28:21.230 --> 28:25.401
Every frickin' time. I'm gonna lose it.

28:26.485 --> 28:27.486
Oh!

28:28.320 --> 28:29.488
Thank you.

28:30.239 --> 28:32.074
Ah! Mmm!

28:35.578 --> 28:37.329
There's something wrong with that.

28:38.372 --> 28:40.833
Don't drink that. That's awful.

28:57.433 --> 28:58.434
Nick?

28:59.727 --> 29:01.228
Nick.

29:06.150 --> 29:09.278
Fifty percent off everything.
More you buy, the merrier you are.

29:09.361 --> 29:12.281
Sir, it's a privilege to wear that suit.

29:12.865 --> 29:13.949
Put some pants on.

29:17.411 --> 29:18.829
So naughty.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.503
<i>Have you seen this man?</i>

29:25.586 --> 29:26.879
Mmm-mmm.

29:27.463 --> 29:28.839
Definitely not one of ours.

29:29.423 --> 29:31.425
Cheap suit, no one's gonna believe that.

29:39.475 --> 29:41.393
Sorry I'm late, dude.
Forgot my pants.

29:56.617 --> 30:00.538
You know, Mr. Ortega, I think it's better
you know the truth about your brother

30:00.621 --> 30:03.249
stealing all of your money
than to live in a fantasy.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.626
I disagree.

30:10.923 --> 30:11.966
Um...

30:12.049 --> 30:15.177
Merry Christmas. Noelle Kringle. Jake?

30:15.261 --> 30:16.846
Saw your name on the sign.

30:16.929 --> 30:18.931
Why are you so red?

30:19.515 --> 30:22.601
And why are you wearing a winter hat
and mittens in Phoenix?

30:22.685 --> 30:23.978
Because it's an ensemble.

30:24.728 --> 30:26.730
But I'm here
'cause I'm looking for my brother.

30:26.814 --> 30:28.941
I'm worried something
might have happened to him.

30:29.024 --> 30:30.109
Like what?

30:31.652 --> 30:35.823
Well, my father ran a business,

30:35.906 --> 30:38.325
and after he passed,
my brother was supposed to take over,

30:38.409 --> 30:39.869
but he left and came to Phoenix,

30:39.952 --> 30:43.455
'cause he said he needed to breathe
and stretch and relax.

30:43.539 --> 30:45.499
But we have to find him because I know,

30:46.500 --> 30:48.627
in his heart, he wants to
run the family business.

30:48.711 --> 30:51.589
I find most people, they don't know
what's in their own hearts.

30:51.672 --> 30:52.882
Let alone anyone else's.

30:52.965 --> 30:56.051
That's if they even have a heart
in the first place.

30:56.552 --> 30:57.553
Oh!

30:57.636 --> 30:59.597
That's pretty stocking half empty.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.515
Yeah, well, I'm a private detective.

31:01.599 --> 31:03.392
You get "stocking half empty"
pretty quick.

31:03.476 --> 31:07.980
- Do you have a picture of this brother?
- Yes. His name is Nick Kringle.

31:08.063 --> 31:09.773
- Nick Kringle?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:10.691 --> 31:12.485
- You're Noelle Kringle?
- That's me.

31:13.068 --> 31:15.946
- You're pretty deep into Christmas.
- Best day of the year, right?

31:16.030 --> 31:18.699
Yeah, well, it's definitely
a day of the year.

31:18.782 --> 31:21.911
I'm on the way out, but I'll see
what I can do for $150 a day.

31:22.578 --> 31:25.789
Money, yes. You cannot put a price
on what this is worth to me.

31:27.291 --> 31:28.334
- Up front.
- Okay.

31:34.757 --> 31:36.091
"In Santa We Trust"?

31:36.175 --> 31:39.803
That's real gold on the outside.
And chocolate in the middle.

31:39.887 --> 31:43.307
Look, lady, um, with all due respect...

31:44.350 --> 31:46.101
Get some sunblock fast.

31:49.688 --> 31:50.940
Uh...

31:51.023 --> 31:54.151
- Jake, you don't understand, see...
- My phone died. Can I borrow yours?

31:54.235 --> 31:55.611
I don't have a phone.

31:55.694 --> 31:58.489
Oh, of course, probably hard to dial
with mittens on.

31:58.572 --> 32:01.408
Only get two days with him before
Christmas, and now I'm late.

32:01.492 --> 32:02.910
- With who?
- My son, my boy,

32:02.993 --> 32:04.870
I'm supposed to take him
to a basketball game

32:04.954 --> 32:06.747
and now my ex-wife's...

32:06.831 --> 32:09.416
Let's find you a phone.
I'm sure somebody will let us...

32:09.500 --> 32:11.919
No, people don't just let people
borrow phones.

32:12.002 --> 32:13.796
- It doesn't work that way.
- It's Christmas.

32:13.879 --> 32:15.381
Oh, I forgot it's Christmas.

32:15.464 --> 32:18.634
Okay, excuse me, ma'am,
may I please borrow your phone?

32:18.717 --> 32:20.010
Like I want your germs.

32:20.928 --> 32:22.388
- Okay.
- See what I mean?

32:22.471 --> 32:24.890
Excuse me, sir,
may I please borrow your...

32:24.974 --> 32:25.975
Um...

32:26.392 --> 32:28.602
See what I mean? Kringle?

32:30.312 --> 32:31.313
Kringle?

32:34.233 --> 32:35.234
Kringle?

32:39.530 --> 32:40.531
Ask him.

32:41.157 --> 32:43.284
- Who?
- That man, he's nice.

32:43.367 --> 32:44.827
- He's nice?
- Yeah.

32:44.910 --> 32:45.911
How do you know?

32:46.912 --> 32:48.539
I don't know, I just know.

32:49.415 --> 32:50.416
Excuse me.

32:52.501 --> 32:54.211
- Sir, hi.
- Hi.

32:54.295 --> 32:56.714
My friend has an important call
to make, his phone died.

32:56.797 --> 32:58.591
Is there any way he could borrow yours?

32:59.175 --> 33:00.843
Sure, no problem.

33:01.844 --> 33:02.970
Oh.

33:04.096 --> 33:05.639
- Oh, thanks.
- It's okay.

33:05.723 --> 33:07.308
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

33:09.810 --> 33:12.438
Noelle Kringle. I hope you get
what you want for Christmas.

33:12.521 --> 33:15.357
- Matt Bautista. I'm actually a Buddhist.
- Oh, jolly!

33:15.441 --> 33:17.526
My dad always said,
"Christmas is like sushi,

33:17.610 --> 33:19.862
"the Japanese invented it,
but now everybody loves it."

33:20.696 --> 33:22.031
Well, I do love sushi.

33:23.782 --> 33:25.367
Thank you, I really appreciate that.

33:25.451 --> 33:27.661
My pleasure. You guys have a great day.

33:27.745 --> 33:29.079
- Bye, Matt.
- Bye.

33:30.372 --> 33:33.209
Thank you, Kringle. Uh, I gotta run.

33:39.298 --> 33:41.175
Give me that picture of your brother.

33:42.510 --> 33:46.013
Come by the office tomorrow at 9:00.
Bring non-edible money.

33:46.096 --> 33:48.265
Do they make that?
I'm kidding. I know they do.

33:48.349 --> 33:50.768
And I'll find some. I will bring some.

33:50.851 --> 33:53.270
Thank you for helping me,
you're being so nice.

33:53.896 --> 33:55.356
It's a big day for nice.

33:56.398 --> 33:58.692
Yeah. Big day for nice.

34:01.654 --> 34:05.574
<i>Merry Christmas,
Elf-folk, it's Santa. Santa Gabe.</i>

34:06.283 --> 34:09.245
<i>As you may know, my cousin Nick,
the ex-Santa,</i>

34:09.328 --> 34:12.706
<i>never completed the Nice or Naughty list,
but that's jolly.</i>

34:12.790 --> 34:14.833
<i>Because it allowed us to develop...</i>

34:14.917 --> 34:16.252
<i>FALALA.</i>

34:16.335 --> 34:20.589
<i>Forensic Algorithm for Lateral Analysis
of Latent Altruism.</i>

34:20.672 --> 34:22.091
<i>It's a digitized metric</i>

34:22.174 --> 34:25.344
<i>which allows us to determine
a child's Nice or Naughty quotient.</i>

34:25.427 --> 34:26.554
<i>For instance...</i>

34:26.637 --> 34:28.179
Holy night.

34:28.264 --> 34:30.431
<i>This is Kali from Brooklyn.</i>

34:30.516 --> 34:32.518
<i>Using his internet activity,
school records,</i>

34:32.601 --> 34:34.061
<i>and satellite surveillance,</i>

34:34.145 --> 34:38.232
<i>FALALA was able to ascertain that
he is Nice. And he wants a PlayStation.</i>

34:39.108 --> 34:42.652
<i>We're now standardizing
all packages in green, red,</i>

34:42.735 --> 34:45.489
<i>or the best of both, swirl.</i>

35:06.510 --> 35:09.555
- Oh, what's this?
- Uh, guacamole?

35:09.638 --> 35:12.433
- Guaca-what? Gua...
- Guacamole?

35:12.516 --> 35:14.435
Guacamole? What is it made from?

35:15.519 --> 35:16.729
Hi, Helen.

35:16.812 --> 35:19.064
Can I have $150 a day, please?

35:19.648 --> 35:22.318
Hey, Helen. We're all out of bird food.

35:22.401 --> 35:25.070
They seem to
really be enjoying the churros.

35:25.154 --> 35:27.865
Uh, you could buy some churros,
cut them into little pieces

35:27.948 --> 35:30.367
and sell them as reindeer treats,
like you said, Helen?

35:30.451 --> 35:33.913
Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well...

35:33.996 --> 35:36.790
Don't keep these little nuggets
of brilliance all to yourself.

35:36.874 --> 35:38.918
How many great ideas
have you been sitting on?

35:40.377 --> 35:41.587
Three.

35:41.670 --> 35:45.090
Let's get together. I'd love to hear
anything else you have to say.

35:45.674 --> 35:47.968
You're full of surprises. Mmm.

35:49.803 --> 35:51.514
Oh.

35:51.597 --> 35:52.598
Mmm-hmm.

35:52.681 --> 35:53.974
- You're the best.
- Oh, yeah.

35:56.936 --> 35:58.854
- Helen.
- Yes.

36:00.314 --> 36:01.565
I wouldn't... Um...

36:01.649 --> 36:05.653
I can't give you $150 in cash.

36:05.736 --> 36:08.906
But I can give you $150
in retail merchandise.

36:08.989 --> 36:12.618
What would you like?
Bath Bar, Cinnabon, Chrysler Pacifica?

36:12.701 --> 36:15.704
I don't know what those things are,
but I will take all of them.

36:15.788 --> 36:17.373
Also, can we stay here tonight?

36:23.796 --> 36:26.131
Come on. It's a Secret Santa party.

36:49.697 --> 36:50.698
Huh.

36:51.407 --> 36:53.033
Matt Bautista is nice.

36:55.786 --> 36:57.997
Santa, we're still not clear

36:58.080 --> 37:03.169
how you plan to deliver billions
of presents with no sleigh or reindeer.

37:03.252 --> 37:07.298
First of all, there aren't actually
billions of presents, Elder Elf Abe.

37:07.381 --> 37:09.300
Our research indicates

37:09.383 --> 37:15.347
that there are only 2,837 nice children
in the world.

37:16.682 --> 37:17.850
What?

37:17.933 --> 37:20.519
Gabe, how is that possible?

37:20.603 --> 37:23.230
Nearly every child fibbed,

37:24.106 --> 37:26.025
refused to eat their vegetables,

37:26.108 --> 37:30.029
or failed to practice
proper dental hygiene.

37:30.112 --> 37:34.825
<i>Joy to the world
Except for you</i>

37:34.909 --> 37:39.497
<i>'Cause you forgot to floss</i>

37:39.580 --> 37:43.918
Oh, no, you can't measure
a child like that.

37:44.001 --> 37:46.420
Everyone makes mistakes.

37:46.504 --> 37:52.009
Which is why each naughty child
will be receiving an evaluation notice

37:52.092 --> 37:53.677
explaining the decision

37:53.761 --> 37:56.263
and encouraging them
to do better next year.

37:56.347 --> 37:57.681
No!

38:01.143 --> 38:02.812
Kringle, come in.

38:02.895 --> 38:04.855
Was just lookin' at your case.

38:04.939 --> 38:05.940
Oh.

38:12.363 --> 38:14.198
Oh, hi! Who are you?

38:14.281 --> 38:16.408
Oh, this is my son. Alex, this is Noelle.

38:16.492 --> 38:17.618
- Hi.
- Hi!

38:17.701 --> 38:19.537
Oh, I totally see the resemblance.

38:19.620 --> 38:22.873
I couldn't find any money,
but I did bring all this stuff.

38:24.041 --> 38:27.002
- Did you steal this stuff?
- Of course not. Stealing's naughty.

38:28.963 --> 38:31.882
- Is that the new <i>Madden?</i>
- I don't know, maybe.

38:31.966 --> 38:35.719
And also, I had all these
extra Christmas decorations

38:35.803 --> 38:39.765
in the sleeve... of my jacket.

38:39.849 --> 38:42.393
And I thought they might
brighten the place up a little.

38:42.476 --> 38:45.479
Oh, thanks, that's kind. I haven't
come up with much on your brother.

38:45.563 --> 38:49.650
I'm gonna need some more time, not today,
'cause Alex and I are going to laser tag.

38:49.733 --> 38:52.194
- I'd rather go to work with you, Dad.
- Me too!

38:52.278 --> 38:54.989
I never get to go to work.
Unless it's at the workshop.

38:55.072 --> 38:57.992
But we're not going to a workshop. Are we?

38:58.075 --> 39:01.203
I never get to see what you do.
It'll be interesting.

39:01.287 --> 39:02.705
So interesting.

39:02.788 --> 39:03.789
Um...

39:04.331 --> 39:08.419
I don't know about that. But, uh...
Sure, if that's what you want to do.

39:08.502 --> 39:10.129
Let me get your other file, Kringle.

39:13.132 --> 39:17.011
So, Alex, are you excited about Christmas?

39:17.094 --> 39:19.430
I have mixed feelings, honestly.

39:19.513 --> 39:22.057
About Christmas? How's that possible?

39:22.641 --> 39:23.893
It's complicated.

39:23.976 --> 39:25.811
Maybe you're just not eating enough.

39:26.353 --> 39:28.355
I can't. It's terrible.

39:28.439 --> 39:29.815
The eggs are rubbery,

39:29.899 --> 39:32.568
the bacon is burnt on the outside,
and raw in the middle.

39:32.651 --> 39:36.322
Pancakes bounce, I don't even know
what that is, and there's no seasoning.

39:36.405 --> 39:37.740
Would you like a candy cane?

39:37.823 --> 39:40.201
No, I have to eat this.

39:40.284 --> 39:42.828
I don't wanna hurt my dad's feelings,
he worked hard on it.

39:42.912 --> 39:45.915
Oh, well, maybe I can help.

39:45.998 --> 39:48.167
Just get a couple pancake...

39:49.251 --> 39:50.628
- Oh!
- Kringle!

39:52.421 --> 39:55.007
Hey! Good appetite.

39:55.090 --> 39:58.010
That is how you grow up
strong and healthy.

39:58.594 --> 40:00.971
So, Kringle, I called the police,
the hospitals,

40:01.055 --> 40:02.848
the morgue,
the bureau of records, nothing.

40:02.932 --> 40:04.683
Only place left to check are the shelters.

40:05.267 --> 40:06.519
Shelters like igloos?

40:13.108 --> 40:15.027
Good morning,
welcome to Phoenix shelter.

40:15.110 --> 40:16.153
How can I help you?

40:16.237 --> 40:20.407
Morning, my name's Jake Hapman.
I'm a licensed private detective.

40:20.491 --> 40:22.201
We're looking for a Nick Kringle.

40:22.284 --> 40:23.410
A Nick Kringle?

40:23.494 --> 40:26.372
He's about 6'2",
he's dressed in a red suit,

40:26.455 --> 40:28.916
he's got a beard, pom-pom.

40:28.999 --> 40:30.000
I have a picture.

40:30.084 --> 40:32.628
And, yes. I know how strange that sounds.

40:34.588 --> 40:36.757
- That's so beautiful.
- She can't hear you.

40:36.841 --> 40:38.843
- Oh. That's...
- She's deaf.

40:39.844 --> 40:40.845
Sorry.

40:43.264 --> 40:45.140
It's really a lovely picture, though.

40:55.484 --> 40:58.988
My daughter says thank you,
and she wants to know what your name is.

40:59.071 --> 41:01.782
My name is Noelle.

41:04.410 --> 41:05.411
Do you know sign?

41:07.204 --> 41:10.291
No. Not that I'm aware of, no.

41:15.588 --> 41:19.175
It's nice to meet you too, Michelle.
What do you want for Christmas?

41:30.811 --> 41:33.606
I need to go get her lunch,
but it was nice to meet you.

41:37.151 --> 41:39.403
An iPad. You got it.

41:42.406 --> 41:43.991
How did you just do that?

41:44.867 --> 41:47.745
I don't know. I don't.

41:47.828 --> 41:50.372
- Did you study it in school?
- No, I majored in calligraphy,

41:50.456 --> 41:52.458
I had a minor in popcorn stringing.

41:52.541 --> 41:54.543
And I...
None of this make sense.

41:54.627 --> 41:56.921
What kind of world is this? This is awful.

41:57.004 --> 42:00.925
You have people without homes
and food, and I'm so hot. God!

42:01.008 --> 42:03.385
Uh, do you have any ice in this town?

42:12.394 --> 42:14.855
Kringle, two minutes.

42:20.945 --> 42:22.822
Hello. Merry Christmas.

42:23.823 --> 42:25.825
- Can I get some fruit pops?
- Sure.

42:25.908 --> 42:27.868
Ooh, fruit pops. There you go.

42:27.952 --> 42:30.120
Do you want anything else?
Any gelato or...

42:30.204 --> 42:32.248
No, I think I'm good. Thanks.

42:32.331 --> 42:34.333
I like your pants, they're jolly.

42:34.416 --> 42:37.878
Yeah. They're yoga pants. Like yours.

42:38.629 --> 42:41.715
Yes. And these are my yogurt pants.

42:42.383 --> 42:46.554
No. Yoga... pants.

42:46.637 --> 42:50.266
Oh, yeah. I love yogurt pants.

42:52.101 --> 42:55.187
- Never mind.
- Okay. Bye.

42:55.271 --> 42:56.689
She was weird, right?

42:57.481 --> 42:58.774
Where are you from?

42:58.858 --> 43:00.359
A little town up north.

43:00.985 --> 43:03.195
- You mean Canada?
- Canada wishes.

43:04.113 --> 43:06.907
Mmm, instant hot chocolate?
Is this for real?

43:06.991 --> 43:10.661
It's a powder. You pour hot water in it
and it becomes hot chocolate, instantly.

43:10.744 --> 43:12.454
Mmm, sounds naughty.

43:12.538 --> 43:15.249
It's way better when you make it
with real melted chocolate.

43:15.833 --> 43:17.042
Yeah, I agree.

43:17.126 --> 43:19.837
- That's how we used to make it.
- With your mom and dad?

43:19.920 --> 43:22.214
We tried to keep my dad
out of the kitchen,

43:22.298 --> 43:24.383
but he was in charge of
putting lights in the tree

43:24.466 --> 43:25.676
and we'd hang stockings together.

43:25.759 --> 43:27.511
This toy is messy.

43:27.595 --> 43:30.431
I don't think
we're gonna be doing that this year.

43:31.515 --> 43:32.725
'Cause it's complicated?

43:34.226 --> 43:36.896
Yeah. Well, it's still Christmas,
you know?

43:36.979 --> 43:38.647
And you still get a present from Santa.

43:39.273 --> 43:40.316
Oh...

43:40.399 --> 43:41.567
It's kind of offensive.

43:42.151 --> 43:45.070
- I don't think I still believe in Santa.
- Santa's real.

43:45.154 --> 43:47.698
He's under a lot of pressure right now,
but he's very real.

43:47.781 --> 43:51.118
In fact, if you tell me what you want,
put in a good word for ya. Hmm?

43:52.620 --> 43:54.288
Come on, give me a shot.

43:54.955 --> 43:56.207
Try me, come on.

43:57.541 --> 44:00.377
- Okay. I think I want...
- Hey, Kringle.

44:00.461 --> 44:02.338
- I found your brother.
- What?

44:02.421 --> 44:03.631
- Yep.
- How?

44:03.714 --> 44:04.840
The yoga pants.

44:04.924 --> 44:06.842
- Why do people keep saying that to me?
- Yoga.

44:06.926 --> 44:10.095
You said Nick wanted to breathe,
stretch and relax? I did some googling,

44:10.179 --> 44:13.974
and I found a Christmas Yoga Class
taught by a Nick K.

44:14.058 --> 44:16.519
Nick K? Nick K! That's him! Ah!

44:16.602 --> 44:20.189
Let's go find him.
Ready, and one, two, three...

44:20.272 --> 44:22.483
- I'm gonna drop Alex at my sister's...
- Okay.

44:22.566 --> 44:24.443
- ...and I'll drive you up there.
- Um, sir...

44:25.152 --> 44:26.862
This says Santy Claus.

44:26.946 --> 44:29.490
You know it's Santa Claus. I...

44:29.573 --> 44:33.160
These'll just get sent back if you
don't fix that. Okay, thank you, bye.

44:35.913 --> 44:40.125
You know what you need to do? You need to
get Alex the perfect Christmas present.

44:40.209 --> 44:45.047
What about a cheese grater for Alex.
Or a George Foreman Grill?

44:45.130 --> 44:46.465
Alex doesn't cook.

44:47.007 --> 44:48.008
Oh.

44:48.092 --> 44:49.718
Are you sure?

44:49.802 --> 44:53.180
He analyzed the breakfast you gave him
this morning in great detail.

44:53.264 --> 44:54.640
He really warmed up to you.

44:55.975 --> 44:58.811
- He's a great kid, isn't he?
- Yeah. Oh, steak knives.

44:58.894 --> 45:04.859
Sometimes, I feel like a hyped-up
camp counselor when he's around.

45:04.942 --> 45:07.486
I have to make sure
he's havin' a good time

45:07.570 --> 45:09.905
since we don't get to
see each other as much.

45:09.989 --> 45:12.074
And I feel guilty and...

45:12.158 --> 45:14.076
And then I overcompensate and...

45:15.870 --> 45:17.037
I don't know.

45:18.956 --> 45:20.040
That must be hard.

45:22.543 --> 45:25.796
Anyway, here we are.

45:32.178 --> 45:33.470
Oh, hey, there it is.

45:34.221 --> 45:35.723
Okay.

45:35.806 --> 45:39.727
You were so great with Alex,
I wanted to give you this.

45:40.895 --> 45:43.397
This, thank you.

45:43.481 --> 45:45.816
Wow. Um, it's, uh...

45:46.358 --> 45:47.860
Oh, mmm...

45:47.943 --> 45:50.070
Yeah, it's... Oh, okay.

45:51.822 --> 45:54.658
Oh, my gosh, it's magical. Look at that.

45:56.452 --> 45:58.078
- Uh...
- Ugh.

45:59.497 --> 46:01.123
Stuffed chimneys!

46:01.207 --> 46:04.001
It smells like it should taste good,
but it doesn't.

46:04.084 --> 46:07.546
You're supposed to put in on your face.
Haven't you ever used sunblock before?

46:08.088 --> 46:10.257
Yeah, sunblock. No, I love sunblock.

46:10.341 --> 46:13.761
It's for blocking the sun.
It's great. Is that good?

46:13.844 --> 46:15.638
You might wanna spread it around.

46:15.721 --> 46:18.724
Oh, no, yeah, I forgot to
spread it around. Just like that.

46:18.807 --> 46:20.518
It's burning. Oh, my God, it's in my eye.

46:20.601 --> 46:22.102
- Well, you wanna...
- It's in my eye.

46:22.186 --> 46:24.730
- What do you like about this product?
- Stay still. Let me...

46:24.814 --> 46:26.774
- Stop. Just gotta rub it in.
- Okay, yep!

46:26.857 --> 46:30.402
- Just stay still.
- Worse than getting hit with a slush ball.

46:30.486 --> 46:34.073
Just gotta... You got a couple of
extra coats, but...

46:36.534 --> 46:39.620
Never know when you're gonna need
an extra coat. It is winter.

46:41.372 --> 46:43.332
- Thanks!
- No problem.

46:43.415 --> 46:45.000
All right. Good luck in there.

46:46.001 --> 46:47.545
Say hello to your brother for me.

46:47.628 --> 46:49.797
Will do. Merry Christmas.

46:58.264 --> 47:02.268
Breathe in through your nose,
out your mouth.

47:03.310 --> 47:07.481
Now assume... downward facing reindeer.

47:11.235 --> 47:14.363
Very good, Cindy. Pete?

47:14.947 --> 47:17.074
Ow!

47:17.158 --> 47:20.327
Hey, hey!

47:20.411 --> 47:23.539
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

47:23.622 --> 47:26.584
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here? This is crazy.

47:26.667 --> 47:30.129
- What's on your face?
- Oh! Oh, it's sunblock.

47:30.212 --> 47:31.755
Yeah, the heat here, right?

47:31.839 --> 47:35.467
It's like being locked in the cookie
cottage during toll-house season, right?

47:35.551 --> 47:37.553
- Oh, by the way... You scared me so much.
- Shh!

47:37.636 --> 47:39.221
- Come on.
- Yoga voice.

47:39.305 --> 47:41.307
- You had me worried sick.
- Yoga voice.

47:41.390 --> 47:44.560
- Mom's been beside herself.
- Yoga voice. Stop. Wait. Ellie, I'm sorry.

47:44.643 --> 47:47.480
I'm sorry, okay. Just hold on.
Can't let anybody hear.

47:49.231 --> 47:52.401
Listen, I like it here. Okay?

47:52.485 --> 47:56.906
I like the weather. I like yoga, I mean,
I donated all my thermals to charity.

47:56.989 --> 47:59.200
Weird, you can tell me about it
in the sleigh.

47:59.283 --> 48:00.868
No, listen. I'm...

48:02.745 --> 48:03.829
I'm not going back.

48:04.497 --> 48:07.458
I'm sorry, I must have
cotton candy in my ears.

48:07.541 --> 48:12.588
I know. I can't pretend to be
someone I'm not anymore.

48:12.671 --> 48:16.050
I could, but I start to break out
in a rash, and my hair starts to...

48:16.133 --> 48:18.177
Okay, Nick, I understand.

48:18.260 --> 48:21.472
You're under a lot of pressure and I know
what it's like to be a Kringle,

48:21.555 --> 48:24.308
- this family legacy we have to live up to.
- Not the same thing.

48:24.391 --> 48:26.227
Well, I am Santa's daughter, so...

48:26.310 --> 48:28.979
Well, no one's ever expected anything
of you, Noelle.

48:30.898 --> 48:34.026
I mean, I've been training
to be Santa my whole life.

48:34.109 --> 48:36.487
While you've been... What?
Cutting ribbon,

48:36.570 --> 48:39.448
and making your silly cards?

48:39.532 --> 48:41.909
- Thought you liked my cards.
- I do.

48:41.992 --> 48:43.828
I'm sorry I said that.
I do like your cards.

48:43.911 --> 48:46.121
They're very creative.
I admire your <i>shakti.</i>

48:46.205 --> 48:48.499
- My what?
- Your female energy.

48:48.582 --> 48:51.710
Besides, you're the one
that told me to go.

48:51.794 --> 48:54.755
You said, you, you said,
"Go! Take some time."

48:54.839 --> 48:57.967
I said take the weekend.
Nobody listens to me.

48:58.050 --> 48:59.510
You know how hard this has been?

48:59.593 --> 49:01.595
Everybody at home is blaming me,
yelling at me,

49:01.679 --> 49:03.931
and nobody's giving me
my Kringle discount anymore.

49:04.014 --> 49:06.141
So it doesn't matter
that I'm finally happy

49:06.225 --> 49:09.770
or that me leaving the Pole was the
best thing I could've done for Christmas.

49:09.854 --> 49:11.647
All that matters
is what's happening to you.

49:11.730 --> 49:14.441
Oh, you better not pout,
you better not cry.

49:14.525 --> 49:16.360
All I have ever done is try to help you.

49:16.443 --> 49:19.488
You're a coward who's too afraid
to be Santa Claus!

49:19.572 --> 49:23.367
Exactly! Bingo! Partridge in a pear tree!
That's what I've been trying to tell you!

49:23.450 --> 49:27.037
- Then I guess, that's all there is to say.
- Wait, where are you going?

49:27.121 --> 49:30.207
I'm going to the North Pole
where nobody expects anything from me.

49:30.291 --> 49:32.251
Do you know what?
If I wasn't so enlightened,

49:32.334 --> 49:33.752
I'd be seething with anger right now.

49:33.836 --> 49:34.920
- Oh, ho, ho!
- Yeah!

49:35.004 --> 49:36.881
- So now you don't like my <i>shakti?</i>
- No!

49:36.964 --> 49:38.340
You don't like my female energy?

49:38.424 --> 49:39.967
- Is this too much for you?
- Relax.

49:40.050 --> 49:41.552
Oh, I'll give you female energy.

49:42.261 --> 49:43.345
Oh!

49:43.429 --> 49:45.097
Get ready, 'cause I...

49:46.015 --> 49:47.558
Don't do that. Please.

49:49.310 --> 49:51.312
Wow! That's a big deal in here.

49:53.689 --> 49:55.065
Merry Christmas!

49:58.444 --> 50:01.447
<i>Come see
and play with Santa's reindeer,</i>

50:01.530 --> 50:03.782
<i>only at Desert Ridge Marketplace.</i>

50:03.866 --> 50:04.950
Ooh!

50:05.034 --> 50:06.577
Look at the reindeer!

50:06.660 --> 50:09.163
Nick's happy here.
Yeah, he wants to stay.

50:09.246 --> 50:12.333
You know what? Maybe it'll be fine.
Maybe Gabe will be a great Santa.

50:12.416 --> 50:15.127
- Hey, Noelle.
- What are you guys doing here?

50:15.211 --> 50:17.546
We heard about these amazing reindeer
at the mall.

50:17.630 --> 50:18.797
Are you a part of this?

50:18.881 --> 50:22.051
Well, yes, I know these reindeer.

50:25.137 --> 50:26.305
Who are these people?

50:26.388 --> 50:28.474
Oh, Jake, Alex. This is Elf...

50:29.225 --> 50:32.686
This is my aunt, Polly.
She plays an elf in the show.

50:32.770 --> 50:34.480
A grumpy, bitter, miserable elf.

50:34.563 --> 50:36.649
I thought elves were
supposed to be like, uh...

50:36.732 --> 50:39.985
Cute? That's a common misconception.

50:41.195 --> 50:43.447
Now wait a minute.
I wanna show you something.

50:44.490 --> 50:47.034
See this? What do you think it does?

50:47.827 --> 50:50.663
Nothing. It's just for show. Try those.

50:50.746 --> 50:52.665
So, how'd it go with your brother?

50:52.748 --> 50:55.292
Oh, not great. Yeah, we got in
a big argument. So...

50:55.918 --> 50:57.837
- The holidays can be tough.
- Mmm.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.340
Alex is spending Christmas
with his step-dad and my ex, Jessie.

51:01.423 --> 51:03.425
This is the first holiday
since the divorce.

51:03.509 --> 51:05.302
So he's havin' a rough time.

51:05.386 --> 51:07.555
She's invited me over
for Christmas morning.

51:07.638 --> 51:10.057
That's amazing!
Oh, Alex would love that so much.

51:10.140 --> 51:12.893
- You're gonna go, right?
- I think she just feels obligated.

51:12.977 --> 51:15.896
It'll probably be awkward,
I don't wanna ruin Christmas for Alex.

51:15.980 --> 51:18.315
I'm gonna stay at home,
put a frozen pizza in the oven

51:18.399 --> 51:21.360
and watch some basketball.
Like a total loser.

51:21.443 --> 51:23.654
Dad! The sleigh is amazing.

51:23.737 --> 51:24.989
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

51:25.072 --> 51:28.242
I don't wanna be a party pooper,
but I think it's time we get goin'.

51:29.535 --> 51:31.370
When are we gonna see
Noelle and Polly again?

51:31.453 --> 51:33.956
- Probably never.
- Polly! That...

51:34.999 --> 51:38.294
Well, I do have somewhere
I need to be for Christmas.

51:38.377 --> 51:42.173
But you're gonna get your wish and spend
Christmas with your whole family.

51:42.256 --> 51:44.633
Because you're nice. I mean, officially.

51:47.344 --> 51:50.014
Come on. Thanks, guys. It was...

51:50.097 --> 51:51.182
It was jolly.

51:53.726 --> 51:56.103
Oh, I hope their Christmas works out.

51:56.687 --> 51:58.898
Oh, well, look at you.

51:58.981 --> 52:02.193
Worrying about someone else's Christmas
and not your own.

52:02.276 --> 52:04.195
Now that is very mature.

52:05.279 --> 52:06.697
Thank you, Polly.

52:07.865 --> 52:09.825
Oh! Snowcone!

52:11.952 --> 52:13.954
What are you doing here?

52:14.038 --> 52:15.831
How did you get here?

52:15.915 --> 52:17.791
Did you fly here all by yourself?

52:18.584 --> 52:20.586
Polly! Look who it is.

52:21.504 --> 52:25.299
You're so brave. You must have picked up
my scent from all the people in Phoenix.

52:25.382 --> 52:27.968
How many people
wear gingerbread deodorant?`

52:29.136 --> 52:32.181
Oh. What have you got? It's from Mother.

52:32.765 --> 52:36.227
"Noelle, I know I was angry,
but even though you acted selfishly

52:36.310 --> 52:38.270
"and foolishly and immaturely, and..."

52:38.354 --> 52:40.940
Right, I'm gonna skip ahead.

52:41.524 --> 52:43.442
"Disrespectfully, childishly.

52:43.526 --> 52:46.237
"You must find your brother
and bring him home because...

52:47.196 --> 52:51.784
"Gabe says there are
only 2,837 nice children,

52:51.867 --> 52:56.330
"and wants to deliver their presents by
drone or something called Amazon Prime.

52:56.914 --> 52:58.749
"As Kringles, for 2,000 years,

52:58.833 --> 53:02.294
"we've dedicated ourselves to bringing
the joy and happiness that is Christmas

53:02.378 --> 53:04.797
"to the world and we must make sure
nothing changes that.

53:04.880 --> 53:09.093
"So I sent you the last flying reindeer in
the Pole to help you rescue your brother."

53:27.444 --> 53:28.696
<i>Okay, Snowy,</i>

53:28.779 --> 53:31.365
you found me, so I know
you can find Santa, okay?

53:31.448 --> 53:34.660
He smells like hot chocolate and
peppermint, now it's mixed with incense.

53:34.743 --> 53:36.287
He's on a whole journey.

53:36.370 --> 53:38.205
But I need you to track him. Okay?

53:38.289 --> 53:39.874
But we can't take you out
looking like this.

53:54.722 --> 53:57.433
Just walkin' my dog, you know.

53:57.516 --> 54:00.519
His name is Rover. Which is a dog's name.

54:00.603 --> 54:03.314
That's why I named him that.
It's a very rare breed.

54:03.397 --> 54:05.858
He's a white Polar Poodle.

54:05.941 --> 54:08.027
You smell something? What do you smell?

54:08.110 --> 54:10.029
Whoa! Rover!

54:12.114 --> 54:14.116
- Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Rover!

54:14.200 --> 54:15.659
Please make a donation.

54:19.914 --> 54:22.041
What do you smell, boy? Was Santa here?

54:23.000 --> 54:26.086
Yeah? What do you smell?
Where'd he go? Did he go this way?

54:26.629 --> 54:27.630
He go this way?

54:31.509 --> 54:33.260
I don't understand.
It's very professional,

54:33.344 --> 54:36.180
you look very Dasher junior.
We gotta find Santa.

54:41.852 --> 54:44.647
Next stop, Desert Botanical Gardens.
Yoga retreat.

54:47.274 --> 54:48.275
Okay!

54:49.735 --> 54:51.111
After you.

55:23.352 --> 55:27.481
Oh, okay. Great job, little guy.
Wish me luck.

55:45.249 --> 55:46.250
Nick.

55:47.459 --> 55:49.044
Hi, I know you're mad at me.

55:49.503 --> 55:50.588
Um...

55:50.671 --> 55:56.260
There's things going on at home
that... only Santa can fix.

55:58.762 --> 56:00.764
Really. See for yourself.

56:05.436 --> 56:10.900
Okay. I realize I wasn't seeing things
from your point of view.

56:10.983 --> 56:12.902
Nobody asked you
if you wanted to wear the hat.

56:12.985 --> 56:15.446
We all expected you to take the reins
and that's not fair.

56:15.529 --> 56:18.866
And... I'm sorry.

56:21.619 --> 56:22.995
But we really need you.

56:26.207 --> 56:27.791
Nick, won't you even speak to me?

56:31.754 --> 56:32.838
Silent for how long?

56:34.006 --> 56:36.133
When the flowers, yeah, when...

56:36.217 --> 56:38.093
It's the... Is this a...

56:38.177 --> 56:40.471
And a... A hand comes in.

56:40.554 --> 56:42.973
Is that a bird landing?

56:43.057 --> 56:45.559
You were always bad at charades.
This will take forever.

56:45.643 --> 56:47.144
Two words? Two words.

56:47.228 --> 56:49.605
Two words. First word, me.

56:49.688 --> 56:50.940
Until sunrise.

56:51.023 --> 56:52.399
Shh!

56:53.108 --> 56:55.694
Okay. Well, I can wait till sunrise.

56:55.778 --> 56:57.822
- No!
- Talk at sunrise. Yeah.

56:57.905 --> 56:59.824
- I'll wait until sunrise.
- You gotta go.

56:59.907 --> 57:03.118
- I'll be quiet as a mouse.
- You've never been quiet. Get outta here.

57:03.202 --> 57:05.579
- I'm quiet all the time.
- One, two, three, be quiet.

57:06.831 --> 57:08.582
I was only...

57:08.666 --> 57:11.919
- I was talking 'cause you were talking.
- See! You can't do it.

57:12.002 --> 57:16.090
Noelle, I'm sorry, you gotta go.

57:17.091 --> 57:18.133
Okay.

57:20.010 --> 57:23.097
I'm just gonna leave this.
You don't have to read it.

57:23.639 --> 57:24.890
Just, if you want to.

57:26.725 --> 57:27.810
I love you.

57:29.311 --> 57:30.437
Whatever you wanna do.

57:44.785 --> 57:45.953
Relax.

57:48.372 --> 57:49.665
<i>Team tracks for Texas.</i>

57:49.748 --> 57:51.625
<i>He drives down the court,
it's an easy lay-up.</i>

57:51.709 --> 57:55.004
- It helps if you put salt on it.
- No one has that much salt, Dad.

57:56.338 --> 57:57.339
Oh.

57:58.132 --> 57:59.466
What did I do wrong?

57:59.550 --> 58:01.886
You can make the pan hotter
before you put the meat in.

58:01.969 --> 58:03.596
Don't press the patties down so hard.

58:03.679 --> 58:06.599
It loses the juices and gets dried out.
And if you toast the bun,

58:06.682 --> 58:09.560
and put some butter on it, it gives it
this crunchy texture each bite.

58:09.643 --> 58:12.688
Oh, why didn't you tell me
you were into cooking?

58:13.272 --> 58:15.316
I thought maybe you wouldn't like it.

58:15.399 --> 58:18.569
Hey, man, I like everything you do.

58:19.403 --> 58:21.530
Hey, maybe you could give me some lessons.

58:24.867 --> 58:27.703
<i>Guess who's coming
to the marketplace. Santa!</i>

58:27.786 --> 58:29.705
<i>Hope you've been nice this year.</i>

58:29.788 --> 58:31.290
Let's go over there.

58:39.548 --> 58:41.717
Supercuts. How do I look?

58:42.343 --> 58:43.469
Like Prancer.

58:44.053 --> 58:46.972
More like Vixen,
with that tuft of hair up there.

58:49.183 --> 58:50.935
Santa!

58:51.018 --> 58:52.603
- Nick. Hey!
- Hey.

58:52.686 --> 58:54.730
I'm so sorry.

58:54.814 --> 58:58.901
Look. What's happening at the Pole
is very naughty.

58:59.735 --> 59:01.028
But I can't be Santa.

59:01.111 --> 59:03.155
The Santa that they hired isn't here yet.

59:03.239 --> 59:05.658
Sit with a couple of kids,
you'll feel The Twinkle.

59:05.741 --> 59:09.578
And if you don't, no more pressure.
I will leave you alone. I almost promise.

59:10.412 --> 59:12.206
- I can't, Ellie.
- Nick Kringle,

59:12.289 --> 59:15.668
this is in your blood. It's in your stars.

59:15.751 --> 59:17.169
It's in your destiny.

59:17.253 --> 59:19.672
I left the suit in the North Pole.

59:19.755 --> 59:21.757
That's a problem, Nick. Come on.

59:22.383 --> 59:24.009
This costume is ridiculous.

59:24.093 --> 59:26.303
I don't see any difference
from what you usually wear.

59:26.387 --> 59:27.847
- Excuse me?
- Or...

59:27.972 --> 59:29.682
You think I look like this all the time?

59:29.765 --> 59:32.434
Worst thing anyone's ever said to me.
You, gather the reindeer.

59:32.518 --> 59:35.646
- We're doing this and going home.
- Well, how is it different?

59:35.729 --> 59:37.940
Little lower and to the right, please.

59:39.441 --> 59:41.485
I just don't think
it's that great of an idea.

59:41.569 --> 59:42.570
Santa!

59:42.653 --> 59:44.405
- It'll be great.
- There's a lot of them.

59:44.488 --> 59:46.282
- I don't know...
- You're gonna be great.

59:46.365 --> 59:48.742
Santa is so excited to meet you guys.

59:51.954 --> 59:54.206
You got this. Come on up.

59:54.290 --> 59:55.708
Go ahead. Go on.

59:55.791 --> 59:58.335
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Hi!

59:59.795 --> 01:00:01.505
Merry Christmas. What's your name?

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:08.304
Right back at you.

01:00:16.979 --> 01:00:20.399
- His name's Ajeet. He's from India.
- Wait, how do you know that?

01:00:20.774 --> 01:00:22.401
I don't know. You pick stuff up.

01:00:22.985 --> 01:00:25.404
For Christmas, he wants his cousin
to come live with him

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.156
- in Phoenix, Arizona.
- Okay.

01:00:29.992 --> 01:00:31.702
- And an iPad.
- An iPad. I got that.

01:00:32.286 --> 01:00:34.497
That was fun, right? Merry Christmas.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.666
- Do we break for lunch now or is that...
- No!

01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:43.964
- Hello!
- Let's not make a meal out of this.

01:00:44.048 --> 01:00:48.552
I'm only doing it so my parents
can practice using Snapchat.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:54.391
Got it. So, Merry Christmas.
What's your name?

01:00:54.475 --> 01:00:57.061
Tonya. Tonya Cooperman.

01:00:57.478 --> 01:01:01.065
Tonya Cooperman.
And have you been a good girl?

01:01:01.148 --> 01:01:03.734
I really don't see
how that's your business.

01:01:03.818 --> 01:01:05.069
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:01:05.152 --> 01:01:07.154
That was over the line, um...

01:01:07.947 --> 01:01:10.449
Let's say you were a good girl,

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:13.118
what do you want for Christmas?

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:15.329
Why? You're gonna get it for me?

01:01:15.412 --> 01:01:18.249
A pathetic mall Santa?

01:01:18.332 --> 01:01:21.043
You're right.
He's not gonna get it for you.

01:01:21.126 --> 01:01:24.213
Because you were so mean to Jennie Stalts
just 'cause she has a lisp.

01:01:24.296 --> 01:01:26.549
Tonya, Jennie is your best friend.

01:01:26.632 --> 01:01:27.883
Get over here.

01:01:28.926 --> 01:01:30.511
How'd you know about Jennie Stalts?

01:01:30.594 --> 01:01:32.721
She had a Jennie Stalts vibe,
I don't know.

01:01:33.055 --> 01:01:37.017
Usually, it takes people years of yoga
to get that kind of awareness.

01:01:39.645 --> 01:01:41.105
Oh, I see my friend. I'll be back.

01:01:41.188 --> 01:01:42.857
- Wait, no!
- You're doing great!

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.235
No, I'm not. Please,
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:01:47.695 --> 01:01:48.696
Next.

01:01:50.823 --> 01:01:52.992
Hi, Merry Christmas. What's your name?

01:01:53.075 --> 01:01:55.286
Why did you write this to me, Santa?

01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:59.999
"Dear Roberto, due to your
continuous failure to make your bed,

01:02:00.082 --> 01:02:02.626
"you will not be receiving
a present this year.

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:04.712
"We invite you
to correct this naughty flaw

01:02:04.795 --> 01:02:07.339
"and reapply for present status
next Christmas."

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.799
Yeah, I didn't write that.

01:02:09.675 --> 01:02:12.678
"Best wishes, Santa." Hmm. Right there.

01:02:12.761 --> 01:02:14.430
- I got one too.
- I got one too.

01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:16.599
- I got one.
- I got one too.

01:02:17.224 --> 01:02:20.519
Hey! Oh, my God! I'm so jolly you're here.

01:02:21.479 --> 01:02:25.107
Did you tell Alex that I would spend
Christmas with him and my ex-wife?

01:02:25.566 --> 01:02:28.944
Yeah. It's his Christmas wish
to go to that Chinese restaurant

01:02:29.028 --> 01:02:31.655
you guys always go to
on Christmas day, Sun Ming,

01:02:31.739 --> 01:02:33.949
and have the red and green egg rolls.

01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:35.993
But I told you,
Jessie and I don't get along.

01:02:36.076 --> 01:02:40.039
She has a new life with her husband
and Alex, and I can't go over there.

01:02:40.122 --> 01:02:43.417
Yeah. But if you use Christmas
to open up and talk about it...

01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:46.086
Me? Open up?

01:02:46.504 --> 01:02:48.297
Kringle, you're the one who omits things.

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:51.926
Like how you can speak sign language,
or chocolate money.

01:02:53.427 --> 01:02:56.847
No. That's fair, um, yeah.

01:03:02.686 --> 01:03:06.315
My dad was Santa Claus, he was great.

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.859
Every Christmas Eve,
he would slide down the chimney.

01:03:08.943 --> 01:03:12.321
Could've come in the front door, but he
wanted to give us the full treatment.

01:03:12.404 --> 01:03:16.325
Nick and I would peek out from our rooms,
I'd say I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus.

01:03:16.408 --> 01:03:18.160
And then Dad would sit with us

01:03:18.244 --> 01:03:21.747
and tell us about his night,
and that was my favorite present.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:26.043
And then, Elf Polly, now Aunt Polly,

01:03:26.126 --> 01:03:27.753
um, she would take us to bed.

01:03:28.796 --> 01:03:31.215
Six months ago, Dad died,

01:03:31.298 --> 01:03:33.801
so, Nick became Santa
and he was feeling overwhelmed,

01:03:33.884 --> 01:03:36.637
so I told him that he should
take some time off,

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.681
get away for a while and he wound up here,

01:03:38.764 --> 01:03:40.766
and now he wants to stay and do yoga,

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.519
and, um, everybody in the North Pole
is really mad at me.

01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:47.148
So, I took the sleigh and the reindeer
to bring him back.

01:03:52.945 --> 01:03:55.406
All right, thank you
for being so nice to Alex.

01:03:56.157 --> 01:03:58.909
Good luck, Kringle. Merry Christmas.

01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:05.374
Look, there's another Santa!

01:04:05.457 --> 01:04:08.085
What're you doing?
This is my gig. Time to move.

01:04:08.169 --> 01:04:09.420
Can I just say one thing?

01:04:09.503 --> 01:04:10.796
- I'm certified.
- Sorry.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.382
I have a diploma
from the Phoenix Santa school.

01:04:13.465 --> 01:04:15.593
Sit back down.
This is where you belong.

01:04:15.676 --> 01:04:18.888
- I belong in that chair.
- Excuse me. You sit down.

01:04:18.971 --> 01:04:21.765
You are not even a real Santa.
I need you to show some respect.

01:04:21.849 --> 01:04:24.560
- He's the real Santa.
- Let's discuss this over here.

01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:26.020
Hey! You...

01:04:27.688 --> 01:04:29.231
- You're coming with me.
- Oh, sorry!

01:04:29.315 --> 01:04:31.358
- Leave her alone.
- This is unnecessary.

01:04:31.442 --> 01:04:33.569
- Noelle!
- Nick, stay where you are.

01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:35.779
- Sorry!
- These kids need to meet the real Santa.

01:04:35.863 --> 01:04:37.865
- I'll give you a free yoga class.
- Uh...

01:04:37.948 --> 01:04:41.619
Ho, ho, ho! Who is next? You, come on.

01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:48.792
Look, my sister didn't mean any harm,
okay? She just...

01:04:48.876 --> 01:04:50.878
She used to beat me up
for fun all the time.

01:04:50.961 --> 01:04:53.631
She's just having fun, okay?
She's fun-loving.

01:04:53.714 --> 01:04:55.716
I guess that's why she assaulted a cop.

01:04:55.799 --> 01:04:58.511
She's talkin' about crazy things
like the North Pole and elves.

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:00.012
What's so crazy about elves?

01:05:00.095 --> 01:05:02.640
They're holding her
for psychiatric evaluation.

01:05:02.723 --> 01:05:04.934
Wait, tomorrow is Christmas Eve, though.

01:05:05.017 --> 01:05:07.061
Thanks for the reminder.
I still gotta shop.

01:05:07.144 --> 01:05:11.607
You still need to shop? Well, you know,
I can get you whatever you want.

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:15.069
You know? Straight from the workshop.

01:05:16.028 --> 01:05:20.991
You want a My Little Pony Explore
Equestria Crystal Empire Castle playset?

01:05:21.075 --> 01:05:22.284
Done.

01:05:23.077 --> 01:05:25.663
I'll get it for you. With accessories.

01:05:26.038 --> 01:05:27.456
I don't have any kids.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.791
What a shock.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:35.339
There's only two days
till Christmas.

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:39.635
Why don't you just eat
the whole gavel, Elder Elf Abe?

01:05:39.718 --> 01:05:44.265
Now, I say we take all 2,837 presents,

01:05:44.348 --> 01:05:48.644
put them on a motorized ice floe
with GPS coordinates and...

01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:50.646
He can't do it!

01:05:50.729 --> 01:05:52.815
GPS coordinates!

01:05:53.357 --> 01:05:56.485
Gabe, for the last time,

01:05:56.569 --> 01:06:02.324
there're more than 2,837 nice children.

01:06:02.408 --> 01:06:03.409
Yeah!

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:07.621
However many presents there are,
we have no way to deliver them.

01:06:07.705 --> 01:06:09.999
No, listen to me. I can do this.

01:06:10.082 --> 01:06:13.836
We just need to do a reboot or maybe
get an appointment at the Genius bar.

01:06:13.919 --> 01:06:16.130
Please, I can do it!

01:06:19.216 --> 01:06:21.802
<i>Reports are filing in
from all over Phoenix</i>

01:06:21.886 --> 01:06:26.932
<i>of emails denying children presents
and signed by Santa Claus.</i>

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:31.395
<i>Young Evelyn Ramirez received one
because she bites her fingernails.</i>

01:06:31.479 --> 01:06:35.941
<i>Another boy was rejected
because of his failure to floss.</i>

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.403
<i>It seems like there's a real shortage
of Christmas spirit this year.</i>

01:06:40.362 --> 01:06:43.657
<i>Hopefully, we'll have some more
cheerful stories for you soon.</i>

01:06:44.575 --> 01:06:51.540
<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,
Merry Christmas!</i>

01:06:58.005 --> 01:06:59.840
<i>There was a disturbing scene</i>

01:06:59.924 --> 01:07:02.593
<i>at the Desert Ridge Marketplace today.</i>

01:07:02.676 --> 01:07:04.762
<i>A hysterical woman...</i>

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:30.204
Listen, I know we can't hang
this Christmas,

01:07:30.287 --> 01:07:32.289
but I got you something.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:42.091
Thanks, Dad. This is great.

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:44.593
I know you told Noelle
you wanted me to come over

01:07:44.677 --> 01:07:48.347
and do our traditional Sun Ming
red and green eggroll thing, but I just...

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.349
Dad, I never told Noelle that.

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.351
Well, then, how did she know?

01:07:52.434 --> 01:07:55.354
She said I'd get what I wanted
for Christmas, but I never told her.

01:07:55.437 --> 01:07:58.440
- Come on, Alex. That's ridiculous.
- Dad, it's true!

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:12.371
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:08:12.454 --> 01:08:13.914
Can I come in?

01:08:13.998 --> 01:08:15.291
Sure, Aunt Polly.

01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:16.876
Thank you.

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:19.420
Or should I say... Elf Polly?

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:23.799
Sit.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.313
Now, I see she told you,

01:08:37.395 --> 01:08:39.314
and I see that you don't believe her.

01:08:39.398 --> 01:08:40.899
That she lives in the North Pole?

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:46.071
No. I tend to believe what I can see.

01:08:47.113 --> 01:08:48.573
Well, if that's the only problem.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:50.451
Oh!

01:08:51.076 --> 01:08:52.620
You should get that looked at.

01:08:54.787 --> 01:08:57.625
Let me ask you a question, Detective.

01:08:57.707 --> 01:08:59.335
Can you see love?

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.046
Can you see sorrow?

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.551
Can you see joy?

01:09:09.595 --> 01:09:12.055
Is there anything realer than that?

01:09:13.057 --> 01:09:15.100
Like what you feel for your boy?

01:09:35.787 --> 01:09:36.788
How can I help?

01:09:37.665 --> 01:09:40.917
Get her out of that hospital,
and I will take care of the rest.

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.798
Why do you think
you're here today, Noelle?

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.885
Because I kicked a policeman,

01:09:49.969 --> 01:09:53.471
which isn't illegal where I'm from.
Because we don't have policeman.

01:09:54.014 --> 01:09:55.099
I see.

01:09:56.016 --> 01:09:57.476
And where are you from?

01:09:59.478 --> 01:10:02.815
The North Pole, and my dad is Santa Claus,

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:06.026
and now my brother is Santa Claus.
You can start laughing now.

01:10:06.819 --> 01:10:09.280
I'm not gonna laugh, Noelle.

01:10:09.363 --> 01:10:12.449
I've dealt with many patients
who have unusual identities.

01:10:12.825 --> 01:10:15.369
I treat a man who believes
he's the tooth fairy.

01:10:17.163 --> 01:10:18.539
Well, that's ridiculous.

01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:21.375
And a woman who's certain
she's Mother Nature.

01:10:22.209 --> 01:10:24.879
Wow. Some real nuts out there.

01:10:24.962 --> 01:10:28.716
And I have another patient who's convinced
he's Frosty the Snowman.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.050
Frosty's here?

01:10:31.218 --> 01:10:35.514
No, no. Come on. Nice try.
Frosty couldn't survive in Phoenix.

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.433
At home, he doesn't even go indoors.

01:10:37.516 --> 01:10:39.518
He's terrified of fireplaces.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.021
Drama queen. Miss that guy.

01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:46.650
You know, the thing is,

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:50.696
I just thought this was my chance
to do something right.

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:54.533
You know? I wanted to prove
I'm not some spoiled princess

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:58.120
who just thinks about herself and writes
her silly cards all day, you know?

01:10:59.663 --> 01:11:04.251
I always thought, eventually,
I'd do something important.

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:10.174
- Yes?
- Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sussman,

01:11:10.257 --> 01:11:13.511
but I need Miss Kringle
on official police business for a second.

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:15.888
That's fine.

01:11:21.936 --> 01:11:24.647
Right outside if you need me,
Jake. You got two minutes.

01:11:32.738 --> 01:11:36.408
Look, I don't know how you knew
about me and Alex,

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:39.578
- and our red and green eggroll tradition.
- I shouldn't have interfered.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:42.581
You know, but you made him happy.
And you made me...

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:44.083
Deliriously joyful.

01:11:45.376 --> 01:11:47.628
Laugh... mostly at you.

01:11:48.379 --> 01:11:50.756
Which still makes it my best Christmas
in a long time.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.884
So, when Polly came to see me
about getting you out of here...

01:11:53.968 --> 01:11:55.886
Wait, so you believe what I told you?

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:59.390
I believe that you believe.

01:12:00.099 --> 01:12:02.560
But to get out of here,
stop talking about the North Pole,

01:12:02.643 --> 01:12:03.894
and Santa Claus.

01:12:03.978 --> 01:12:05.479
- Yeah. And sleighs.
- And sleighs.

01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:06.730
Oh!

01:12:07.648 --> 01:12:08.941
What? What?

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:14.405
Oh, the sleigh. You've seen it before.
You saw it at the mall.

01:12:14.488 --> 01:12:17.992
You haven't seen it hovering
11 stories up, that's the only difference.

01:12:20.619 --> 01:12:21.704
You okay?

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:25.624
Miss Kringle, I think that
we should resume and... Oh!

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.501
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:27.585 --> 01:12:29.503
That's unusual.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:39.013
Jake? It's Clara. Open up.

01:12:39.096 --> 01:12:40.347
Quick, get in your...

01:12:40.431 --> 01:12:41.599
- Sleigh, yeah.
- Sleigh.

01:12:43.017 --> 01:12:45.769
You're not a total loser.
You're a nice person.

01:12:45.853 --> 01:12:47.354
And a wonderful dad.

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.440
And you're very generous with sunblock.

01:12:49.857 --> 01:12:51.317
Jake? Open up.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.735
- Just go!
- Yeah.

01:12:54.361 --> 01:12:55.362
Come on.

01:12:55.779 --> 01:12:56.947
Careful.

01:12:57.031 --> 01:12:58.199
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

01:12:58.282 --> 01:13:00.451
- Bye.
- Okay, let's go.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:04.914
- Whoa! I'm not good at this!
- Yes, yes you are.

01:13:10.628 --> 01:13:17.593
<i>I'll have a Blue Christmas without you</i>

01:13:18.302 --> 01:13:19.512
We miss you, Santa.

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:26.352
<i>I'll be so blue
just thinking about you</i>

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.813
Candy just doesn't taste the same
without you, Santa.

01:13:28.896 --> 01:13:33.484
<i>Decorations of red</i>

01:13:33.567 --> 01:13:38.030
<i>On a green Christmas tree</i>

01:13:38.531 --> 01:13:42.201
<i>Won't be the same, dear</i>

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:44.745
<i>If you're not here with me</i>

01:13:44.829 --> 01:13:47.581
Just come back, we got
the milk and cookies for you, Santa.

01:13:47.665 --> 01:13:52.211
<i>And when those blue memories start calling</i>

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.630
Snowball fights, the Coco. All the fun.

01:13:54.713 --> 01:13:56.298
<i>You'll be...</i>

01:13:56.382 --> 01:13:58.217
Santa's back!

01:13:59.677 --> 01:14:00.678
Ooh!

01:14:01.929 --> 01:14:05.099
My children are home!

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:10.104
I missed you! Oh, my goodness!

01:14:10.187 --> 01:14:13.149
You did it, Noelle. Polly!

01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:15.025
Uh...

01:14:16.193 --> 01:14:21.448
I... I know I let you all down,

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:25.286
but while I was away, I...

01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:28.539
I learned what it takes to be Santa.

01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:31.667
It's about understanding people,
and, uh...

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:36.422
and really listening
to what they have to say.

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:37.506
And, um...

01:14:39.758 --> 01:14:41.886
And just making everyone feel jolly.

01:14:43.637 --> 01:14:48.184
Which is why I know that we have
a real Santa right here in the Pole.

01:14:48.267 --> 01:14:49.268
Yes!

01:14:52.646 --> 01:14:54.356
My sister, Noelle.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.025
- What?
- What did he say?

01:14:56.108 --> 01:14:57.276
Did he say "Noelle?"

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:03.949
Nick. I appreciate the gesture,
but what are you doing?

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:05.701
That's why I came home, you know.

01:15:05.784 --> 01:15:07.745
The minute I saw you with those kids,
I knew.

01:15:07.828 --> 01:15:10.831
No. Okay. Maybe I inherited a couple
of Dad's powers,

01:15:10.915 --> 01:15:13.000
- but what...
- You have The Twinkle, Ellie.

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:15.836
A girl? Santa's not a girl!

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:17.713
Whoa!

01:15:21.926 --> 01:15:25.554
Silent... night!

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:34.146
I rechecked the Christmas covenant.

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:39.026
And it turns out there's nothing there
that says a woman can't be Santa.

01:15:39.652 --> 01:15:40.778
See?

01:15:41.278 --> 01:15:45.658
It's just a tradition we've been
blindly following for thousands of years.

01:15:45.991 --> 01:15:48.494
- These things happen.
- Oh, man!

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:52.998
The question is,
what really makes a Santa?

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:58.796
Ultimately, the one thing all Santas share
is the ability to inspire us

01:15:58.879 --> 01:16:00.756
with the Christmas spirit.

01:16:02.466 --> 01:16:05.511
Noelle, can you inspire us?

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:07.763
What does Christmas mean to you?

01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:29.285
I used to think Christmas
was the best day of the year.

01:16:29.368 --> 01:16:31.287
Presents and caroling.

01:16:33.247 --> 01:16:36.000
But I met people for whom
it isn't the best day

01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:41.505
because it reminds them they don't have
enough food to eat or a place to live.

01:16:41.881 --> 01:16:43.841
Or maybe even someone
to share the day with.

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:47.219
And it got me thinking.

01:16:48.262 --> 01:16:51.182
For thousands of years,
we've jingled bells and delivered toys,

01:16:51.265 --> 01:16:55.394
and the world just gets more awful
and miserable. So what's the point?

01:16:58.105 --> 01:17:03.152
But I also met a girl at a shelter
who drew these beautiful pictures,

01:17:03.235 --> 01:17:06.113
and her Christmas wish wasn't for herself.

01:17:06.197 --> 01:17:09.950
It was for her mother
to be able to find a job.

01:17:10.743 --> 01:17:12.828
And I met a woman at a marketplace

01:17:12.912 --> 01:17:16.290
who worked so hard to fill Christmas
with fun and music,

01:17:16.373 --> 01:17:19.126
even though she knew she might not have
anyone to spend it with.

01:17:21.212 --> 01:17:25.966
And I met this sweet, wonderful boy
who has this big heart.

01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:27.468
And his father

01:17:27.551 --> 01:17:30.930
who doesn't even believe in Christmas,
but made sure we could be home for it.

01:17:34.141 --> 01:17:39.563
We have this list of nice people
from Hong Kong to Houston

01:17:39.647 --> 01:17:41.607
doing wonderful, selfless things.

01:17:44.485 --> 01:17:47.404
And I know Christmas
can't solve all our problems.

01:17:49.573 --> 01:17:50.699
But it gives us hope.

01:17:52.368 --> 01:17:54.286
It inspires us to be nice.

01:17:54.912 --> 01:17:56.831
That might not seem like much, but...

01:17:58.833 --> 01:18:01.544
when someone's sad or just lonely,

01:18:02.294 --> 01:18:04.129
it can be the biggest thing in the world.

01:18:05.673 --> 01:18:08.217
And presents are part of it.

01:18:08.634 --> 01:18:10.761
I like presents as much as anybody.

01:18:13.472 --> 01:18:14.473
Okay, more.

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:17.351
Oh, yeah, that's true.

01:18:18.519 --> 01:18:22.106
But now, I think it's not just about
the presents we get.

01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:24.233
It's about the presents we give.

01:18:25.442 --> 01:18:27.570
The presents of love and understanding.

01:18:36.954 --> 01:18:38.122
And also, iPads.

01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:44.336
My little girl.

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.923
Looks like we got a Santa, guys!

01:18:48.007 --> 01:18:50.009
Yeah, finally!

01:18:58.893 --> 01:19:02.771
Ho, ho, ho.

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:07.151
If a child wakes up, try to coax them
gently back to sleep.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:30.925
I want everyone
to double-check everything.

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:32.468
Mother.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.721
Um...

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:38.432
I'm not sure about this.

01:19:39.934 --> 01:19:43.604
You know how it works.
It fits you when you fit it.

01:19:46.065 --> 01:19:48.651
Sweetie, you have nothing
to be nervous about.

01:19:48.734 --> 01:19:51.487
Um, son,
why don't we go check the reindeer?

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:52.863
The reindeer? They have ticks.

01:19:52.947 --> 01:19:54.114
- That's... Come on.
- It's not...

01:19:54.198 --> 01:19:55.199
- Let's just go.
- No.

01:19:55.282 --> 01:19:56.283
Come on. Go.

01:20:01.038 --> 01:20:04.875
What're you doing? You know
Santa has to fly solo on Christmas Eve.

01:20:05.292 --> 01:20:08.671
Force of habit.
Once a nanny, always a nanny.

01:20:08.754 --> 01:20:10.172
Elf Polly.

01:20:10.714 --> 01:20:11.715
Yes?

01:20:12.925 --> 01:20:14.593
I don't know if I'm ready, Polly.

01:20:16.637 --> 01:20:19.932
You know what I'm really scared of?
Some kid's gonna wake up, look at me,

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:23.185
and say, "You're not Santa."

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:28.357
From the first moment
that I held you in my arms,

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:32.862
I could see something in your eyes,
and I said to myself,

01:20:33.737 --> 01:20:35.865
"This girl has The Twinkle."

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:40.786
You're ready.

01:20:42.621 --> 01:20:43.622
Oh!

01:20:44.957 --> 01:20:46.542
Pull yourself together.

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.145
Wait. Someone's missing.

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:19.533
Dude, this is supposed to be our song,
come on!

01:21:28.209 --> 01:21:30.544
Okay, Snowy.
I need all the help I can get.

01:21:31.003 --> 01:21:32.338
You're my guy, right?

01:21:34.131 --> 01:21:35.132
Fly straight?

01:21:46.852 --> 01:21:48.354
You're facing the wrong way.

01:21:50.564 --> 01:21:52.233
I'm really glad it's not me.

01:22:04.328 --> 01:22:05.329
On Snowcone!

01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:36.277
Puffins, scatter!

01:22:59.633 --> 01:23:02.344
No! Snowy! Snow...

01:23:08.726 --> 01:23:09.894
All right.

01:23:14.064 --> 01:23:16.150
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas
We...</i>

01:23:58.859 --> 01:23:59.944
Did we miss Greece?

01:24:33.394 --> 01:24:34.812
We're Jewish.

01:24:55.749 --> 01:24:57.042
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:26:02.817 --> 01:26:06.195
No, no, no, no.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Go back to sleep.

01:26:06.737 --> 01:26:08.197
- Seriously. Go back to... Oh!
- Ow!

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.407
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:13.619
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
No. Go back to sleep!

01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:21.752
Hi.

01:26:25.464 --> 01:26:29.218
She says, "Merry Christmas, Santa."

01:26:31.095 --> 01:26:32.179
Santa?

01:26:36.183 --> 01:26:37.601
Thank you, Michelle.

01:26:38.853 --> 01:26:40.187
I needed that.

01:26:41.105 --> 01:26:44.108
Now you go to sleep. Okay?

01:26:50.322 --> 01:26:52.908
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
- Merry Christmas.

01:26:52.992 --> 01:26:54.577
Merry Christmas, Santa.

01:26:55.119 --> 01:26:56.453
Merry Christmas.

01:26:57.288 --> 01:26:58.998
Merry Christmas.

01:26:59.081 --> 01:27:01.208
Go to sleep. You go to sleep.

01:27:31.614 --> 01:27:34.325
<i>Sometimes, all you need
is a nice word from a friend</i>

01:27:34.408 --> 01:27:36.744
<i>to make you feel comfortable
in your own boots.</i>

01:27:37.536 --> 01:27:40.414
<i>But once that happened,
I was ready to go to work.</i>

01:27:41.665 --> 01:27:42.833
<i>I went back to Greece,</i>

01:27:43.417 --> 01:27:46.170
<i>and visited a few other places I'd missed,</i>

01:27:46.253 --> 01:27:49.924
<i>and then I made sure to keep a promise
I'd made to Alex.</i>

01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:56.680
Oh, wow.

01:27:57.765 --> 01:27:58.891
Your stop, I believe.

01:27:58.974 --> 01:28:02.645
Yeah. Aren't you supposed to bring Alex
a Christmas present or something?

01:28:03.312 --> 01:28:06.023
I did. He's sitting right next to me.

01:28:06.941 --> 01:28:08.567
I don't know if this is a great idea.

01:28:08.651 --> 01:28:10.820
I don't want my ex
and her husband to feel weird.

01:28:11.737 --> 01:28:14.615
Traditions change. Right?

01:28:17.076 --> 01:28:18.327
The new ones are scary.

01:28:19.745 --> 01:28:20.955
But they might be great.

01:28:21.664 --> 01:28:23.833
And if you know
what Christmas means to you,

01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:26.252
the tradition's just the wrapping.

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:30.256
Christmas means spending time with Alex.

01:28:32.091 --> 01:28:33.592
There you go.

01:28:33.676 --> 01:28:35.928
That's jolly! Okay! Now get in there.

01:28:36.011 --> 01:28:37.805
I'm serious. You get one ride. Get out.

01:28:37.888 --> 01:28:39.014
- Go.
- Okay.

01:28:39.098 --> 01:28:41.433
- Very busy. Very busy woman.
- Pushy Santa.

01:28:41.851 --> 01:28:43.435
So, will I see you again?

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.605
Every December 24th.

01:28:49.233 --> 01:28:50.568
I don't know what that is.

01:28:50.651 --> 01:28:52.903
It's what you do when you think
someone's awesome.

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:55.573
Aw. Well...

01:28:58.325 --> 01:28:59.827
- All right.
- Oh, right.

01:29:00.327 --> 01:29:01.495
Got it.

01:29:01.996 --> 01:29:03.038
Okay.

01:29:03.539 --> 01:29:05.416
On Snowcone!

01:29:07.668 --> 01:29:10.462
Merry Christmas!

01:29:10.546 --> 01:29:12.173
Man, that's fun to say!

01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:15.759
<i>I was so happy that Jake
got to see Alex for Christmas.</i>

01:29:15.843 --> 01:29:17.261
- Merry Christmas!
- Dad!

01:29:20.306 --> 01:29:21.307
I knew you'd come.

01:29:22.933 --> 01:29:24.894
<i>And Helen finally got her vacation.</i>

01:29:30.774 --> 01:29:32.234
<i>And when Michelle and her mom</i>

01:29:32.318 --> 01:29:34.904
<i>woke up the next morning,
they found a present under the tree</i>

01:29:34.987 --> 01:29:36.947
<i>with a job listing
at a school for the deaf.</i>

01:29:37.031 --> 01:29:39.116
<i>Oh, and an iPad. Obviously.</i>

01:29:42.203 --> 01:29:45.915
<i>Dad always said you never forget
your first Christmas as Santa.</i>

01:29:45.998 --> 01:29:47.249
<i>Okay, he said it to Nick,</i>

01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:50.002
<i>but I overheard it,
and oh, my garland, was he right!</i>

01:29:50.628 --> 01:29:52.463
<i>I hoped he'd be proud of me.</i>

01:29:52.546 --> 01:29:57.218
<i>And I hoped everyone at home had
come around to the idea of a girl Santa.</i>

01:30:01.347 --> 01:30:03.057
Look, Santa's back!

01:30:03.224 --> 01:30:05.392
<i>Turns out, I didn't have to worry.</i>

01:30:05.476 --> 01:30:06.602
Santa Noelle!

01:30:06.685 --> 01:30:09.063
Merry Christmas, Santa Noelle!

01:30:13.442 --> 01:30:16.237
Well, guess who came to town!

01:30:18.656 --> 01:30:21.283
- <i>Namaste,</i> sis.
- Um, <i>Namaste.</i>

01:30:22.076 --> 01:30:23.577
Congratulations, Santa.

01:30:23.994 --> 01:30:27.039
<i>Now that I was the 24th Kringle
to wear the red hat,</i>

01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:31.001
<i>I had a couple small changes
I wanted to make.</i>

01:30:32.545 --> 01:30:34.755
<i>We opened the first yoga studio
in the Pole.</i>

01:30:34.839 --> 01:30:36.799
Sorry.

01:30:36.882 --> 01:30:38.926
<i>I made Polly the first female elder elf.</i>

01:30:39.009 --> 01:30:42.972
Hey! Get out of my garden, now! Go!

01:30:43.055 --> 01:30:44.431
<i>Which I slightly regret.</i>

01:30:44.515 --> 01:30:47.143
These are high-intensity
infrared Santa goggles

01:30:47.226 --> 01:30:49.812
which allow you to detect any lasers
between you and a tree.

01:30:49.895 --> 01:30:53.315
Very impressive. Have we come up with
anything to deal with big, mean dogs?

01:30:53.399 --> 01:30:54.650
Just this bone.

01:30:54.733 --> 01:30:56.026
Okay. Keep working.

01:30:56.110 --> 01:31:00.114
<i>And as for me,
I mean, I'm Santa. It's great!</i>

01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:02.158
- Keep it coming.
- Thanks, Santa.

01:31:02.241 --> 01:31:03.742
Thank you very much.

01:31:03.826 --> 01:31:05.953
Okay, a letter from
Jake and Alex, everybody.

01:31:06.036 --> 01:31:08.038
Alex is into music now,

01:31:08.122 --> 01:31:10.374
so a slow cooker is out
and drum kit is in.

01:31:10.457 --> 01:31:13.377
And throw in a pair of noise-cancelling
headphones for dad. Great.

01:31:17.548 --> 01:31:18.966
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

01:31:19.049 --> 01:31:21.260
<i>Christmas Eve was always
the best night of the year.</i>

01:31:22.887 --> 01:31:25.264
<i>But this time, it was better than ever.</i>

01:31:26.599 --> 01:31:28.809
<i>Because instead of getting the presents,</i>

01:31:29.393 --> 01:31:31.061
<i>I was giving them.</i>

01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:42.030
