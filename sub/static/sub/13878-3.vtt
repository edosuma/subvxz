Tonight's episode...

00:39.410 --> 00:41.350
You know how fast you were going?

00:41.380 --> 00:42.380
Oh, yeah.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.150
Why, what's your gun say?

00:44.180 --> 00:45.250
I clocked it at 136.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.520
In a 25.

00:46.550 --> 00:48.490
In a school zone.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.660
Oh, don't get
your panties in a wad.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.220
There ain't no kids out at this hour.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.590
How many drinks have you had tonight?

00:54.630 --> 00:56.390
Eh, maybe like two or three.

00:56.430 --> 00:57.430
So, you know, I'm good.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.400
And I've been drinking water

00:59.430 --> 01:00.330
for, like, an hour.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.430
How about that one?

01:03.470 --> 01:04.470
All right, fine.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.099
18.

01:05.140 --> 01:08.240
You feel like a big man now, pig, huh?

01:08.270 --> 01:10.880
Maybe you had a real job, you

01:10.910 --> 01:12.080
could afford to party like me

01:12.110 --> 01:14.080
instead of trying to set a trap

01:14.110 --> 01:16.050
to meet your quota.

01:16.080 --> 01:16.550
Is that woman dead?

01:16.580 --> 01:18.620
Oh, man, I hope not.

01:18.650 --> 01:18.980
Let me check.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.590
No, she's not.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.450
Thank God.

01:22.490 --> 01:23.450
I'll say this.

01:23.490 --> 01:26.620
She's gonna be confused
when she wakes up.

01:27.090 --> 01:27.530
Right?

01:29.260 --> 01:30.560
Punch it in the fist!

01:30.600 --> 01:32.300
What's that thing you just

01:32.330 --> 01:34.600
pulled out of your ... aah!

01:34.630 --> 01:36.300
No, I was ... I was polite.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.300
I was like, "yes, sir, no, sir,

01:38.340 --> 01:39.340
"get off my ass, sir."

01:39.370 --> 01:40.370
Oh, that's

01:40.410 --> 01:41.770
wonderful, Carl, but guess what.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.270
This bail's gonna bust me, man.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.610
Just post it up, get my

01:44.640 --> 01:46.380
keys, and I can drive us back home.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.180
You ain't driving
anywhere for a long time.

01:48.210 --> 01:49.210
Look, I ain't had a

01:49.250 --> 01:50.220
d.U.I. In over four months!

01:50.250 --> 01:51.150
You got to respect that!

01:51.180 --> 01:52.180
Carl, let it go.

01:52.220 --> 01:52.620
No!

01:52.650 --> 01:53.690
This pig is messing with me.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.550
Ain't you, piggy, huh?

01:54.590 --> 01:55.320
Oink, oink, oink!

01:55.350 --> 01:57.390
Oh, you like it here, huh?

01:57.420 --> 01:58.360
Don't listen to him, officer.

01:58.390 --> 01:59.520
You can't keep me off the road.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.460
Carl, shut up!

02:00.490 --> 02:02.090
'Cause I paid for them roads!

02:02.130 --> 02:03.090
Get him on out of here!

02:03.130 --> 02:04.100
Hey, can you just sort

02:04.130 --> 02:05.360
of hover over that patrol car?

02:05.400 --> 02:05.600
Yeah.

02:05.630 --> 02:07.070
What are you
doing back there?

02:07.100 --> 02:08.669
Gonna drop a deuce on it.

02:09.699 --> 02:11.200
Where you going?

02:14.570 --> 02:19.180
Where do you think
you're going, stallion?

02:19.210 --> 02:19.840
Uh, just, uh, you know,

02:19.880 --> 02:21.510
gonna organize my cassettes...

02:21.550 --> 02:23.450
Alphabetically.

02:23.480 --> 02:28.090
Eh, Judas priest, uh,
goes before kros...

02:28.120 --> 02:29.490
Okay, I'm done.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.490
Good.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.820
I can show you how this
breathalyzer works.

02:32.860 --> 02:35.190
What's that?

02:35.230 --> 02:36.190
See, now your car won't start

02:36.230 --> 02:37.560
unless you blow into it.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.260
Give it a try.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.600
Uh...
Maybe I'll try later.

02:41.630 --> 02:43.030
So you've been drinking.

02:43.070 --> 02:44.400
All right, I may have

02:44.440 --> 02:46.200
been drinking some of my cologne.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.240
What's your point?

02:47.270 --> 02:48.370
It's a free country!

02:49.410 --> 02:50.510
See you later, stallion.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.110
You can't control me!

02:53.150 --> 02:54.780
I know my rights!

02:54.810 --> 02:55.680
I'm worried about Carl.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.250
You're not worried about him.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.220
You're worried about
flying him everywhere.

02:59.250 --> 03:00.180
Shh, shh, shh!

03:00.220 --> 03:01.350
Turn off the lights!

03:01.390 --> 03:02.290
Hey, gang!

03:02.320 --> 03:05.160
Who's ready to go on a trip?

03:05.190 --> 03:06.060
I see you over there behind the spool.

03:06.090 --> 03:07.260
No, Carl.

03:07.290 --> 03:07.760
Oh, come on.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.230
It's 2.3 Miles to melon shakers.

03:09.260 --> 03:10.230
I can't walk that far!

03:10.260 --> 03:11.500
And then I'll wait

03:11.530 --> 03:12.700
there for three hours, 'cause

03:12.730 --> 03:14.170
you won't pay my cover to get

03:14.200 --> 03:15.500
in, while you get your rocks off

03:15.530 --> 03:16.500
in the champagne room!

03:16.540 --> 03:18.240
Come on, it takes time!

03:18.270 --> 03:19.870
I'm a little desensitized from

03:19.910 --> 03:21.140
years of doing it.

03:21.170 --> 03:22.140
You know what, Carl?

03:22.170 --> 03:24.510
I am sick and tired of flying

03:24.540 --> 03:25.140
your ass to the gas station to

03:25.180 --> 03:26.280
get beer, to the grocery store

03:26.310 --> 03:27.310
to get beer, to the
whorehouse to get beer.

03:27.350 --> 03:28.480
I ain't never made you

03:28.510 --> 03:29.480
take me to theaundromat.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.480
That's 'cause you

03:30.520 --> 03:31.380
don't wash your clothes.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.520
Eh, yeah, that's
a pretty good point.

03:34.450 --> 03:35.750
Touché.

03:35.790 --> 03:36.290
Look, Carl.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.890
Maybe you needo take a good

03:37.920 --> 03:38.320
look at your life.

03:38.360 --> 03:38.990
I look at my life every

03:39.020 --> 03:40.390
day, and I pop a boner.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.390
So I ain't here to talk to you.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.200
I'm here to talk to...
This little man.

03:45.230 --> 03:48.230
How you doing, meat buddy, huh?

03:48.270 --> 03:48.870
I've been pretty

03:48.900 --> 03:51.100
busy pulling this carpet string,

03:51.140 --> 03:52.500
watching it unravel.

03:52.540 --> 03:56.340
It takes up most of my working hour.

03:56.380 --> 03:56.940
How you feel about

03:56.980 --> 03:58.610
a little action, huh?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.080
A little fireworks on a Tuesday night?

04:00.110 --> 04:00.750
A little boom-boom?

04:01.410 --> 04:03.280
Oh, I love me
some fireworks, boy.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.350
Meatwad, don't

04:07.190 --> 04:07.790
encourage his behavior, okay?

04:07.820 --> 04:09.650
But he be encouraged.

04:09.690 --> 04:10.090
I like fireworks.

04:10.120 --> 04:10.520
End of discussion.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.190
Ooh! Can I go?

04:12.220 --> 04:12.620
I can go.

04:12.660 --> 04:13.730
Get lost, cup.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.430
I'm gonna pull your string.

04:16.459 --> 04:18.560
Actually, this ... there is

04:18.600 --> 04:19.000
something to this.

04:19.029 --> 04:21.600
Bloin the tub

04:23.370 --> 04:26.040
Ye-e-ah! Victory!

04:26.070 --> 04:27.140
Screw you, pig!

04:28.070 --> 04:29.270
"Pig"?

04:29.310 --> 04:31.440
Is we going to a petting zoo?

04:31.480 --> 04:33.510
Yeah, a heavy-petting zoo.

04:33.550 --> 04:36.850
I pay $140, and then I let

04:36.880 --> 04:38.220
people pet my snake.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.420
Yeah!

04:46.290 --> 04:48.690
All right, last call's at 3:00.

04:48.730 --> 04:50.530
You stay here, guard my cassettes.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.530
I want to go in.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.200
Yeah, that would
be awesome, right?

04:53.230 --> 04:55.070
Thing is, you got to have $8.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.070
Here is $8.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.340
Uh, yeah, okay.

04:58.370 --> 05:01.270
But you got to have a collar.

05:01.310 --> 05:02.240
Uh, here is a collar.

05:02.270 --> 05:03.170
Fine.

05:03.210 --> 05:06.280
You don't know me, I don't know you.

05:06.310 --> 05:06.640
You got that?

05:06.680 --> 05:07.150
All right.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.610
You don't know me, I don't know you.

05:08.650 --> 05:09.610
But you know I know you.

05:09.650 --> 05:11.380
Right, but while we're inside...

05:11.420 --> 05:13.150
You know I know you know me.

05:13.190 --> 05:14.150
No, I get that.

05:14.190 --> 05:15.950
We rode together,

05:15.990 --> 05:17.460
didn't we?

05:17.490 --> 05:20.360
We'll reconnect at last call.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.060
Hey, meat man. Come here.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.530
Pull the ... pull the car around.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.200
You don't know me,

05:26.230 --> 05:27.200
I don't know you.

05:27.230 --> 05:28.270
We don't know each other.

05:28.300 --> 05:31.200
Yeah, you know me!

05:31.200 --> 05:32.040
Blow into the tube and start the car!

05:32.070 --> 05:33.240
I can't drive no car.

05:33.270 --> 05:34.540
You ain't got to drive!

05:34.570 --> 05:35.570
I'm driv... I'm driving.

05:35.610 --> 05:36.370
I'm the driver.

05:36.410 --> 05:37.740
I just got ... you ...

05:37.780 --> 05:39.510
you just got to start it.

05:39.550 --> 05:42.550
And then you got to
hold me up, put me in.

05:42.580 --> 05:43.410
Then we're good.

05:43.450 --> 05:44.520
I'll drive us home.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.450
Hurry.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.890
I'm urinating on myself.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.590
It ain't starting.

05:50.620 --> 05:51.290
Why ain't it starting?

05:51.320 --> 05:53.790
Probably 'cause I

05:53.830 --> 05:55.560
had five gin and tonics
and a Cuba libre.

05:55.590 --> 05:58.730
I told you not to drink!

05:58.760 --> 05:59.700
I should not have
bought you them drinks.

06:01.170 --> 06:01.430
All right.

06:01.470 --> 06:01.930
You got a butt, right?

06:01.970 --> 06:03.230
Fart into the tube.

06:03.270 --> 06:04.670
"Fart" is a bad word.

06:04.700 --> 06:05.740
All right, fine.

06:05.770 --> 06:06.640
What would you say?

06:06.670 --> 06:07.740
"Booty pooty."

06:07.770 --> 06:09.640
Just, uh, Booty-pooty into it.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.040
I don't need to

06:11.080 --> 06:12.080
Booty pooty right now.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.310
Well, try to Booty pooty.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.580
If I try to

06:15.610 --> 06:16.250
Booty pooty, and I don't need

06:16.280 --> 06:17.010
to Booty pooty, I might leave a

06:17.050 --> 06:18.280
Booty doody, and you don't want

06:18.320 --> 06:19.480
that on your mouth tube.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.720
All right, fine!

06:20.750 --> 06:22.350
I ... just, uh ... we'll just go

06:22.390 --> 06:23.750
to the gas station.

06:23.790 --> 06:26.020
I'll get you a freaking bean burrito.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.490
Okay, uh, we'll

06:29.530 --> 06:30.130
probably have to double back.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.430
We left my nipples back there.

06:31.460 --> 06:32.530
Here we go.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.230
How we doing, gentlemen?

06:34.270 --> 06:35.630
Good morning, offer.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.130
We just ... we just walking home.

06:37.170 --> 06:38.040
We ain't driving.

06:38.070 --> 06:38.640
You know that.

06:38.670 --> 06:40.000
You don't need to be here.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.040
Hey, could
you blow into a tube?

06:42.070 --> 06:43.670
'Cause we too drunk to start our car.

06:43.710 --> 06:44.580
Hey, hey.

06:44.610 --> 06:46.440
I don't know what he's talking about.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.510
That's right.

06:47.550 --> 06:48.780
He don't know me, I don't know

06:48.810 --> 06:50.620
him, we don't know each other.

06:51.020 --> 06:51.550
Listen, son.

06:51.580 --> 06:53.280
If I blow into that tube, that

06:53.320 --> 06:54.590
would be illegal.

06:54.620 --> 06:54.990
Wouldn't it?

06:55.020 --> 06:56.420
See, that's the thing.

06:56.460 --> 06:57.420
You got to fart into it.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.020
No, "fart's" a bad word.

06:59.060 --> 06:59.920
I'm sorry.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.460
"Booty pooty."

07:00.490 --> 07:02.960
"Booty pooty" is what I meant.

07:03.000 --> 07:03.290
Come on.

07:03.330 --> 07:03.830
We're going downtown.

07:03.860 --> 07:04.530
Officer, I got this.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.060
Hey! Frylock!

07:06.100 --> 07:07.100
Hey, take us over to the car

07:07.130 --> 07:08.030
and blow into the tube.

07:08.070 --> 07:09.670
No, Carl.

07:09.700 --> 07:10.300
We're leaving the car here.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.000
I can drive. I can.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.170
I'm gonna drag your

07:12.200 --> 07:13.270
fat ass back, and then we're

07:13.310 --> 07:14.110
gonna have a talk.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.640
Carl, I'm gonna need you to sit

07:15.670 --> 07:17.040
upright for this, man.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.340
No, I'm listening.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.410
Keep doing the thing.

07:20.450 --> 07:21.180
I'm ... I'm just resting my eyes.

07:21.210 --> 07:22.550
Carl, we love you.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.150
And I, for one, do not like

07:24.180 --> 07:26.420
seei you destroy yourself like this.

07:26.450 --> 07:28.090
This long, slow slide is,

07:28.120 --> 07:30.350
frankly, extremely boring to watch.

07:30.390 --> 07:31.420
Why don't you go out in like

07:31.460 --> 07:32.320
a ... a blaze of glory?

07:32.360 --> 07:33.120
Shake.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.160
Light yourself on fire

07:35.190 --> 07:35.560
and rob a bank.

07:35.590 --> 07:35.990
Shake.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.060
Do something at least

07:37.100 --> 07:38.260
I can tweet about and, like,

07:38.300 --> 07:39.100
make me popular!

07:39.130 --> 07:40.200
Come on, man.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.430
But you never think

07:41.470 --> 07:42.270
about me, do you?

07:42.300 --> 07:43.470
All right, look.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.540
Shake's partially right.

07:44.570 --> 07:45.940
You are destroying yourself.

07:45.970 --> 07:47.340
Let me ask you something, Carl.

07:47.370 --> 07:48.710
Have you accepted Jesus Christ

07:48.740 --> 07:50.510
as your personal lord and savior?

07:50.540 --> 07:51.680
Oh, not with this.

07:51.710 --> 07:53.040
Can't we just talk about him

07:53.080 --> 07:53.710
during Christmas?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.050
Is he be the one

07:55.080 --> 07:56.250
what bring all the toys in the

07:56.280 --> 07:56.950
magic sleigh?

07:56.980 --> 07:58.620
For the last time, yes!

07:58.650 --> 07:59.720
Look, me and Jesus,

07:59.750 --> 08:01.850
we ... we don't see eye to eye.

08:01.890 --> 08:02.550
Well, maybe that's

08:02.590 --> 08:03.960
because you're putting
yourself above him.

08:03.990 --> 08:06.460
Yeah, that's right.

08:06.490 --> 08:06.820
You know why?

08:06.860 --> 08:07.530
'Cause he never bought me that

08:07.560 --> 08:07.960
red bike I wanted!

08:07.990 --> 08:09.130
He's not the one, Carl.

08:09.160 --> 08:09.990
That's not him.

08:10.030 --> 08:11.500
Shake just said he was.

08:11.530 --> 08:12.560
I stand by it.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.270
What? Who's Jesus, huh?

08:15.300 --> 08:15.870
Some joker just made out of

08:15.900 --> 08:17.230
clouds, living in the sky so he

08:17.270 --> 08:18.600
can boss me around, tell me I

08:18.640 --> 08:21.440
ain't allowed to touch myself

08:21.470 --> 08:22.370
that way 'cause it don't please him.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.440
Masturbation is specifically

08:24.480 --> 08:26.340
designed to please <i>me!</i>

08:26.380 --> 08:28.510
No one's getting hurt except

08:28.550 --> 08:29.980
the wildebeest.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.950
Yeah. I give him a name.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.190
Why do you think

08:34.220 --> 08:35.590
I go to church every Sunday,

08:35.620 --> 08:35.919
Carl?

08:35.950 --> 08:36.950
I don't know.

08:36.990 --> 08:38.159
So you feel superior to me?

08:38.190 --> 08:39.220
Yeah, sure.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.730
But I also go because Jesus is

08:40.760 --> 08:41.159
real.

08:41.190 --> 08:43.360
Oh, is that right,

08:43.400 --> 08:43.659
smart guy?

08:43.700 --> 08:44.460
Prove it.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.670
See, Carl.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.300
These were all owned by Jesus

08:48.330 --> 08:49.500
at one time ... sneakers made

08:49.530 --> 08:50.500
of sackcloth.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.200
He wore his beard in these

08:52.240 --> 08:53.470
barrettes sometimes.

08:53.510 --> 08:55.510
And here's his favorite pair

08:55.540 --> 08:56.210
of red underwear.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.540
This is very rare and valuable.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.040
I'm gonna go touch

08:59.080 --> 08:59.380
that.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.680
Wait, wait, shake.

09:00.710 --> 09:03.280
Let me ...

09:03.320 --> 09:04.320
Tell you what.

09:04.350 --> 09:07.320
My back is killing me.

09:07.350 --> 09:08.490
Look here.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.320
Jesus got nose boogers just like

09:11.360 --> 09:12.120
you and me.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.420
Boogers have DNA.

09:13.460 --> 09:14.260
That's perfect.

09:14.290 --> 09:15.230
Mmm, they is

09:15.260 --> 09:15.560
perfect.

09:15.590 --> 09:16.560
Meatwad, no!

09:16.600 --> 09:17.290
Mmm.

09:17.330 --> 09:18.300
Is this his hair?

09:18.330 --> 09:19.700
Wow.

09:19.730 --> 09:20.400
He had rock hair.

09:20.430 --> 09:22.730
It's like hetfield back when he

09:22.770 --> 09:24.100
was riding the lightning.

09:24.140 --> 09:25.440
That will do.

09:29.510 --> 09:30.340
I like this.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.080
I'm st gonna do this all day.

09:33.410 --> 09:34.480
Carl, please.

09:34.510 --> 09:36.010
Put the hair in the cloner.

09:36.050 --> 09:37.420
Because I want to introduce you

09:37.450 --> 09:38.980
to a man who changed my life.

09:39.020 --> 09:39.580
Oh.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.150
Could you make, like, a whole

09:41.190 --> 09:42.490
body out of just a section ...

09:42.520 --> 09:44.020
like maybe a head or face?

09:44.060 --> 09:45.190
Yeah, why?

09:45.220 --> 09:46.190
Eh, no reason.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.400
What's up, yo?

09:55.430 --> 09:56.730
Jesus!

09:56.770 --> 09:58.740
You grace us with your presence.

09:58.770 --> 10:00.170
Bow. Everyone, bow.

10:00.210 --> 10:01.510
No, no. I am not he.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.110
For I am Rupert, Jesus' gay

10:03.140 --> 10:03.970
hairdresser.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.340
Wait a second.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.640
Jesus had a hairdresser?

10:07.610 --> 10:09.150
Sweet man, but no hair.

10:09.180 --> 10:10.250
It was atrocious.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.980
Three wires just sticking out

10:12.020 --> 10:12.650
of his head.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.950
I fashioned a wig for most

10:13.990 --> 10:14.690
of his big speeches.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.050
So this was your

10:16.090 --> 10:16.350
hair?

10:16.390 --> 10:17.390
Hey, can you do

10:17.420 --> 10:18.220
something for me?

10:18.260 --> 10:19.320
Like, feather it, but with

10:19.360 --> 10:20.120
frosted spikes?

10:20.160 --> 10:21.130
Like Richie Sambora on

10:21.160 --> 10:22.190
the "bad medicine" tour?

10:22.230 --> 10:23.390
Listen, Rupert...

10:23.430 --> 10:24.600
I could get you some

10:24.630 --> 10:25.100
pics.

10:25.130 --> 10:26.300
...Tell my friend

10:26.330 --> 10:27.200
here about Jesus...

10:27.230 --> 10:28.430
About how he needs to turn his

10:28.470 --> 10:29.330
life over to him...

10:29.370 --> 10:31.340
To trust in him...

10:31.370 --> 10:32.670
To put his faith in him...

10:32.700 --> 10:34.670
To allow him to make him whole

10:34.710 --> 10:36.670
once more.

10:36.710 --> 10:38.340
And then you just blow

10:38.380 --> 10:39.980
into the tube, and then we go.

10:40.010 --> 10:41.250
Right on, man.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.380
I am super excited to do this.

10:45.420 --> 10:46.320
It's gonna be fun.

10:46.350 --> 10:47.220
Shut up.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.220
I love this song!
