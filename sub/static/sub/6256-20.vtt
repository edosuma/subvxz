<i>Previously on</i> Bones...

00:02.751 --> 00:06.000
Any big emotional change, even
good, can trigger a relapse.

00:06.001 --> 00:07.868
I don't understand;
he just read your text.

00:07.904 --> 00:09.671
He might have
too good of a hand.

00:09.706 --> 00:11.673
So what? He's there
to catch a murderer.

00:11.708 --> 00:13.608
He's an addict.

00:13.643 --> 00:16.010
And you checked in
with your sponsor?

00:16.046 --> 00:18.246
Why do I feel like
I'm being interrogated?

00:18.281 --> 00:20.281
I need to put 200
on the Cardinals.

00:20.317 --> 00:22.984
I'm here to collect
on a debt. $30,000.

00:23.019 --> 00:24.352
Jimmy, your bookie, came here.

00:24.387 --> 00:26.621
I paid him everything you owe.

00:26.656 --> 00:27.956
This-this was a mistake,
all right?

00:27.991 --> 00:29.557
Look, I made one bet,
that was it.

00:29.593 --> 00:31.359
I need you to leave.

00:36.933 --> 00:40.869
Jesus said, "Go and make
disciples of all nations,

00:40.904 --> 00:43.905
"baptizing them
in the name of the Father,

00:43.940 --> 00:46.274
the Son and the Holy Spirit."

00:46.309 --> 00:47.909
Amen.

00:49.346 --> 00:51.846
Brother Tepper has accepted
the message of the Lord

00:51.882 --> 00:54.415
and has chosen this day
to be saved.

00:54.451 --> 00:56.217
Uh, it's okay
if I hold my nose, right?

00:56.253 --> 00:57.986
Do not resist,
Brother Tepper.

00:58.021 --> 01:01.055
For with this water,
there can be no death.

Oh, Lord, please!

01:20.844 --> 01:21.976
Help us, Lord!

01:22.012 --> 01:23.878
Begone, Satan!

01:30.153 --> 01:32.420
Begone, Satan!

01:32.455 --> 01:33.888
Oh!

01:43.867 --> 01:45.800
Our kids get along
really well, don't they?

01:47.237 --> 01:49.871
I wish I could say the same
about Booth and me.

01:49.906 --> 01:53.741
Yeah, well, you did kick him
out of the house, sweetie.

01:53.777 --> 01:56.311
Christine
misses him so much.

01:56.346 --> 01:58.446
Is he still going
to his meetings?

01:58.481 --> 01:59.981
That's what he says.

02:02.652 --> 02:04.218
Is the baby kicking?

02:04.254 --> 02:07.555
Mm, every time
I talk about Booth.

02:07.591 --> 02:10.991
This is gonna
work out, Brennan.

02:11.026 --> 02:14.629
Booth has a problem,
but he's a good man.

02:22.839 --> 02:25.607
God, grant me
the serenity to accept

02:25.642 --> 02:27.709
the things I cannot change,

02:27.744 --> 02:30.411
the courage to change
the things I can,

02:30.447 --> 02:32.847
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

02:32.882 --> 02:34.849
Keep coming back.

02:34.884 --> 02:36.417
It works if you work it.

02:36.453 --> 02:37.852
Right.
Yep.

02:44.861 --> 02:46.294
Booth.
Yeah.

02:46.329 --> 02:47.729
How you holding up?
I'm doing great.

02:47.764 --> 02:49.998
Just settled into my new place.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.165
Yeah, so...

02:51.201 --> 02:52.533
You know, I think
it would really help

02:52.569 --> 02:54.235
if you shared
with the group next time.

02:54.270 --> 02:56.137
Yeah, you know, I'm fine.
Being here is good enough.

02:56.172 --> 02:57.639
Not really, Booth.

02:57.674 --> 02:59.207
There's got to be some stuff
you need to work through.

02:59.242 --> 03:02.043
Come on, look, you've been
my sponsor for years, right?

03:02.078 --> 03:04.145
I mean, you know me.
All right?

03:04.180 --> 03:05.847
Uh, I'm trying.

03:05.882 --> 03:07.115
Sure, but...

03:07.150 --> 03:09.050
Tell you what, you know
how you could help?

03:09.085 --> 03:12.120
Give Bones a call and tell
her how good I'm doing here.

03:12.155 --> 03:13.855
That... that's good.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.490
You know it doesn't
work that way.

03:15.525 --> 03:17.525
The only way to heal your
marriage is to work on yourself.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.494
That means participate here.

03:19.529 --> 03:21.496
Share your story
during the meeting.

03:21.531 --> 03:23.631
You know that's
the way it works.

03:27.937 --> 03:29.337
Same time next week.

03:29.372 --> 03:31.239
Yep.

03:41.051 --> 03:43.451
Seems odd that somebody
would dump a body

03:43.486 --> 03:44.852
in such a public place.

03:44.888 --> 03:47.188
Well, the only person
who put the body here

03:47.223 --> 03:49.090
was Mother Nature.

03:49.125 --> 03:51.659
Somebody tossed the body into
the river from way upstream.

03:51.695 --> 03:52.727
Isn't Booth coming?

03:52.762 --> 03:54.829
Uh, he had a meeting.

03:54.864 --> 03:57.098
Why? You don't trust me
to handle things here?

03:57.133 --> 03:59.033
I'm just worried about
my friend, that's all.

03:59.069 --> 04:01.135
So any chance of I.D.?

04:01.171 --> 04:04.172
Small brow ridges
and sharp upper orbital borders

04:04.207 --> 04:05.973
indicate female.

04:06.009 --> 04:07.942
The pubic symphyseal
faces suggest

04:07.977 --> 04:08.977
she was in her
early 50s.

04:08.978 --> 04:10.278
Hey.

04:10.313 --> 04:12.980
Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?

04:13.016 --> 04:14.816
Well, first of all,
we're missing a left arm.

04:14.851 --> 04:17.552
Plus, judging from the jag marks
on the victim's back,

04:17.587 --> 04:19.721
she didn't go into the water
voluntarily.

04:19.755 --> 04:21.255
Well, it's the Potomac--
who would?

04:21.291 --> 04:23.991
I also found some unusual
sculpting of the bones.

04:24.027 --> 04:26.527
Looks like someone took a power
sander to the skull there.

04:26.563 --> 04:28.529
It's so smooth.
It could be a sign

04:28.565 --> 04:29.897
of metabolic disease
or postmortem damage.

04:29.933 --> 04:32.200
Or if the
body was pushed up

04:32.235 --> 04:35.002
against a rock wall inside
a strong hydraulics system.

04:35.038 --> 04:36.738
Like a whirlpool?
Exactly. Yeah.

04:36.773 --> 04:38.406
Meeting go okay?

04:38.441 --> 04:40.742
It's anonymous for a reason,
okay, Aubrey?

04:40.777 --> 04:42.977
I just want to do my job.
Where's the arm?

04:43.012 --> 04:44.645
We're not sure. But
if it's still in there,

04:44.681 --> 04:46.481
Nautilus Jr.'s gonna find it.

04:46.516 --> 04:48.549
Junior.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.790
Swim, buddy, swim.

05:11.941 --> 05:15.243
Geez. You'd think
people would take better care

05:15.278 --> 05:18.980
of the only habitable planet
in our solar system.

05:20.850 --> 05:24.786
Oh. Champagne.
This is high-class living.

05:27.724 --> 05:29.223
It's caught on some weeds.

05:29.259 --> 05:31.259
You know you're responsible

05:31.294 --> 05:33.828
for this very expensive piece
of equipment, Dr. Hodgins.

05:33.863 --> 05:35.596
I know.
Look at that, huh?

05:35.632 --> 05:37.691
Looks like you're going
for a swim, buddy.

05:37.715 --> 05:38.167
Great.

05:38.168 --> 05:41.035
Yeah.

05:41.070 --> 05:43.437
Whew!
Yeah.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.840
Don't forget,
you're looking for an arm.

That's odd. The flesh
decomposition isn't consistent

06:35.663 --> 06:37.396
with the degree of sloughing.

06:37.432 --> 06:40.266
No. The pollution levels in the
Potomac might account for that.

06:40.301 --> 06:42.101
They can be quite toxic.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.536
Yeah, tell me about it.

Why do you think I just took
a 40-minute shower? Man.

06:46.207 --> 06:48.007
The bone is badly abraded.
Well, the sculpting

06:48.042 --> 06:50.877
occurred postmortem, so
it wasn't caused by any disease.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.987
Hmm. Okay, then.

07:01.022 --> 07:02.688
I beg your pardon?

07:02.724 --> 07:04.957
Oh. I'm on your side,
Dr. Brennan.

07:04.993 --> 07:07.627
When the benefits
of one mate diminish,

07:07.662 --> 07:09.195
it only makes sense
to search for another mate...

07:09.230 --> 07:10.863
Not today, Ms. Warren.

07:10.899 --> 07:14.200
Well, I'm just trying to support
Dr. B. She's been going...

07:14.235 --> 07:16.569
I don't need my situation
explained to me, Ms. Warren.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.237
And your support will not hasten

07:18.273 --> 07:19.605
its resolution.

07:22.777 --> 07:24.176
If you need to get that...

07:24.212 --> 07:26.312
I-I don't...

07:26.347 --> 07:29.815
Were you able
to pinpoint time of death?

07:29.851 --> 07:31.784
Behold the aquatic
caddis fly larvae.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.186
Based on the stage

07:34.222 --> 07:35.688
of the case architecture,

07:35.723 --> 07:38.524
she was in the water
for less than four days.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.992
- Huh.
- Okay.

07:40.028 --> 07:42.228
Wow. Well, the
victim's face

07:42.263 --> 07:44.563
is too badly
abraded to do

07:44.599 --> 07:46.866
a reconstruction. I don't know
what we're gonna do,

07:46.901 --> 07:48.234
unless maybe you
find an implant

07:48.269 --> 07:49.902
that has a serial
number on it or...

07:49.938 --> 07:51.370
Or shirt.

07:51.406 --> 07:53.372
Uh, sorry, Hodgins,
I don't...

07:53.408 --> 07:55.207
I don't see anything.
Because there's nothing there.

07:55.243 --> 07:57.476
You see,
it's what used to be there.

07:57.512 --> 07:58.744
Oh.

07:58.780 --> 08:01.080
I think I understand.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.420
This polo shirt
is pretty torn up,

08:07.455 --> 08:09.422
but there used to be
a logo stitched

08:09.457 --> 08:11.390
right above the breast pocket.

08:11.426 --> 08:13.426
Yeah. The thread is gone,
but...

08:13.461 --> 08:15.328
if I can connect the dots

08:15.363 --> 08:18.597
left behind by the embroidery,
then I might be able to recreate

08:18.633 --> 08:20.266
the monogram.

08:20.301 --> 08:22.435
You're a genius.

08:22.470 --> 08:24.937
So how was your conversation
with Brennan this morning?

08:24.973 --> 08:28.341
Ugh. Sort of awful, actually.

08:28.376 --> 08:30.843
She really misses Booth.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.211
He's got to be feeling
the same way.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.613
Maybe she should just
take him back.

08:34.649 --> 08:36.515
If thugs showed up
at our doorstep threatening me

08:36.551 --> 08:38.351
and Michael Vincent
and it was your fault,

08:38.385 --> 08:41.320
I would do a lot more than
just kick you out of the house.

08:41.356 --> 08:44.857
But if he's feeling all alone,
if he feels it's hopeless...

08:44.892 --> 08:46.625
Then he
should fight.

08:46.661 --> 08:49.962
Isn't that what you'd do?

08:49.998 --> 08:52.631
To the death.

08:54.869 --> 08:57.136
Oh. It's ready.

08:59.007 --> 09:01.674
Look at that.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.409
Thompson Hardware.
Okay.

09:03.444 --> 09:06.746
It is in Arlington--
run by Ted Thompson.

09:06.781 --> 09:09.015
All right,
I'll call Aubrey.

09:09.050 --> 09:12.018
It always seemed like
Booth and Brennan were so...

09:12.053 --> 09:15.187
I don't know, so... solid,
you know?

09:15.223 --> 09:18.224
That nothing was ever
gonna tear them apart.

09:18.259 --> 09:20.693
Yeah. I know.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.429
Do you think it's this?

09:23.464 --> 09:25.197
What we do?

09:25.233 --> 09:28.434
Is it eating away
at all of us?

09:28.469 --> 09:31.270
Yeah.

09:31.305 --> 09:34.206
Yeah, maybe it is.

09:34.242 --> 09:37.109
I love you, Angie.

09:37.145 --> 09:40.379
You should call Aubrey.

09:48.089 --> 09:50.389
My God.

09:50.425 --> 09:53.726
Leslie was my best employee.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.461
That explains why she didn't
show up for her shift today.

09:55.496 --> 09:56.829
When was the last time

09:56.864 --> 10:00.099
that you saw Leslie Hodsoll,
Mr. Thompson?

10:00.134 --> 10:01.767
Friday night.

10:01.803 --> 10:04.370
She closed up the register
and then left, just like always.

10:04.405 --> 10:07.440
Can you think of anyone
that might have had anything

10:07.475 --> 10:08.674
against Leslie?

10:08.709 --> 10:11.177
No. Everyone liked her.

10:11.212 --> 10:13.112
I even tried
promoting her

10:13.147 --> 10:17.083
to assistant manager, but she
didn't want the responsibility.

10:17.118 --> 10:18.284
Why's that?

10:18.319 --> 10:19.785
Busy social life or...

10:19.821 --> 10:23.189
She had a kid, um,
that took up her time.

10:23.224 --> 10:25.758
A daughter. Courtney,

10:25.793 --> 10:27.226
I think.

10:27.261 --> 10:28.961
Uh, she was 20 or so.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.463
Two of them get along okay?

10:30.498 --> 10:32.431
I think so.

10:32.467 --> 10:35.000
There was this one time though,

10:35.036 --> 10:37.069
uh, about one month
ago, I-I walked in

10:37.105 --> 10:40.706
on Leslie in the break room,
and-and she was in tears.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.242
Turned out she was talking
to her kid.

10:43.277 --> 10:46.112
Any idea
what they were talking about?

10:46.147 --> 10:49.115
Seemed like normal
mother-daughter stuff, you know.

10:49.150 --> 10:51.584
Uh, "I told you
why I can't be there,

10:51.619 --> 10:54.086
but that doesn't mean
I don't love you."

10:54.122 --> 10:56.088
Stuff like that.

11:00.895 --> 11:02.962
So you can't
give me anything

11:02.997 --> 11:05.598
until the bones
are completely clean?

11:05.633 --> 11:08.834
Yup, that's how it works.
Any reason you're so impatient?

11:08.870 --> 11:11.137
Well, truth, justice;
might as well throw in

11:11.172 --> 11:13.139
the American way
while I'm at it.

11:13.174 --> 11:15.674
Mm. So you're faster
than a locomotive?

11:15.710 --> 11:17.476
You know, girls don't like that.

11:17.512 --> 11:19.011
Tough crowd.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.613
Agent Aubrey,

11:20.648 --> 11:21.847
what brings you to the lab?

11:21.883 --> 11:23.449
Just, uh, following up
on the case.

11:23.484 --> 11:25.584
And you couldn't do that
over the phone?

11:25.620 --> 11:28.420
What can I say?
I'm an in-person kind of guy.

11:28.456 --> 11:30.823
Me, too. You know,
I would way rather

11:30.858 --> 11:32.658
go see a play
than watch a movie.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.060
Right? It's all about
being in the moment.

11:35.096 --> 11:37.229
Totally.

11:38.332 --> 11:40.533
Oh.

11:40.568 --> 11:42.301
What?

11:42.336 --> 11:46.105
Okay, then, uh, since you have
such an intense interest

11:46.140 --> 11:48.174
in the case,
tox results came back

11:48.209 --> 11:50.075
suggesting poisoning.

11:50.111 --> 11:52.244
There are
traces of lead,

11:52.280 --> 11:55.114
cadmium, arsenic,
chromium, selenium,

11:55.149 --> 11:57.983
even low levels
of uranium radiation.

11:58.019 --> 11:59.218
Well, that's strange though,
since there

11:59.253 --> 12:00.519
weren't any metaphyseal bands

12:00.555 --> 12:03.155
on the victim's long bones.
Meaning?

12:03.191 --> 12:04.857
The victim could have been
poisoned over

12:04.892 --> 12:06.825
a long period of time.
So whoever was

12:06.861 --> 12:09.528
poisoning her
must have been close to her.

12:09.564 --> 12:11.463
I'm gonna go
tell Booth.

12:11.499 --> 12:13.132
In person.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.867
Later, Superman.

12:18.306 --> 12:20.739
Long story.

12:22.977 --> 12:24.276
There you are.

12:24.312 --> 12:25.778
I've been looking
all over for you.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.313
Sorry. I had some calls
I had to make.

12:27.348 --> 12:28.948
You okay? 'Cause
to be honest,

12:28.983 --> 12:30.783
you got me and the squints
kind of worried here.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.184
Why? Did Bones
call you or something?

12:32.220 --> 12:34.119
No, we're just all
concerned because

12:34.155 --> 12:36.088
for some crazy reason
we care about you.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.456
Okay, well, maybe
you should be more concerned

12:37.491 --> 12:39.258
that we don't have
a motive or a suspect.

12:39.293 --> 12:40.693
Well, we do now.

12:40.728 --> 12:43.195
Okay? Cam found
signs of poisoning,

12:43.231 --> 12:44.930
which takes a long time
to manifest,

12:44.966 --> 12:47.900
meaning whoever did this
had access to Leslie

12:47.935 --> 12:50.102
over a number of years.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.438
Victim's 20-year-old daughter,
Courtney, still lives with her?

12:52.473 --> 12:54.373
Millenials.

12:54.408 --> 12:55.741
Something doesn't
make sense here.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.309
Mom is gone for four days,
and the daughter

12:57.345 --> 12:59.211
doesn't report
her missing?

12:59.247 --> 13:01.146
All right, let's go.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.587
Hello?

13:08.623 --> 13:10.422
Courtney Hodsoll?

13:10.458 --> 13:12.324
Uh, yeah. That's me.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.126
Can I help you?

13:14.161 --> 13:15.461
FBI Special Agent Booth.

13:15.496 --> 13:16.662
Here's Agent Aubrey
from the FBI.

13:16.697 --> 13:18.030
Going somewhere?

13:18.065 --> 13:21.100
Uh, yeah, yeah, just...
back to my dorms.

13:21.135 --> 13:23.435
I'm just collecting
the last of my stuff.

13:23.471 --> 13:26.805
When was the last time
you saw your mother?

13:26.841 --> 13:29.675
Um, about three weeks ago.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.677
Yeah, right before I moved out
to go live on campus.

13:31.712 --> 13:34.947
I thought I'd see her today,
but I don't know where she is.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.448
I can give you her cell phone
number though, if you...

13:36.484 --> 13:38.284
I'm sorry, but we recovered
your mother's body

13:38.319 --> 13:41.086
from the, uh,
Potomac River this morning.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.724
What? No.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.960
No, you-you must have her
confused with someone else.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.461
We're sorry,

13:49.497 --> 13:52.665
but your mother
was positively identified.

13:55.303 --> 13:58.137
I-I don't understand.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.473
Would it be okay if we could
ask you some questions?

14:05.212 --> 14:08.113
How would you characterize your
relationship with your mother?

14:09.016 --> 14:11.483
It was fine.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.519
Why?

14:13.554 --> 14:15.054
No arguments?

14:15.089 --> 14:18.157
She didn't disapprove
of anything you did?

14:18.192 --> 14:20.793
No.

14:20.828 --> 14:22.828
'Cause she wasn't
that interested.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.700
You know, I know she...

14:27.735 --> 14:30.069
she loved me and all.

14:30.104 --> 14:32.071
And I-I loved her, but...

14:32.106 --> 14:33.806
But?

14:35.242 --> 14:38.310
All she seemed
to care about was her jars.

14:38.346 --> 14:40.079
Jars?

14:40.114 --> 14:42.114
Yeah.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.583
Yeah, I'll show you.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.719
She was obsessed.

14:57.665 --> 14:59.231
Welcome to Mom's world.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.599
You got to be kidding me.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.034
Whoa.

15:08.309 --> 15:11.377
Wow, I thought I
was a cookie fan.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.345
It was all
about the jars.

15:13.381 --> 15:15.314
There was rarely
a cookie in the house.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.949
A collection
like this

15:16.984 --> 15:19.418
must be worth a fortune.
Yeah, I'm sure

15:19.453 --> 15:21.220
some of it was
worth some money,

15:21.255 --> 15:23.155
but mostly it's just
sentimental junk.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.656
Man, she was

15:24.692 --> 15:27.192
really into this-- each
jar had its own entry

15:27.228 --> 15:29.328
with a photo,
description,

15:29.363 --> 15:31.130
the date she bought it,
how much she paid.

15:31.165 --> 15:32.464
Yeah.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.767
If she wasn't
polishing the jars,

15:34.802 --> 15:36.435
she was cataloging them

15:36.470 --> 15:39.772
or going to
collectors conventions.

15:39.807 --> 15:41.707
Come on. You got to admit
though, how cute is that?

15:41.742 --> 15:43.342
Piggy jar?

15:43.377 --> 15:45.711
Put the pig down.
Listen, uh, I'm just guessing

15:45.746 --> 15:47.579
that there were other
people obsessed with these

15:47.615 --> 15:50.048
cookie jars, right?

15:50.084 --> 15:51.844
So did you hear or see
any fights over these?

15:51.852 --> 15:53.252
Oh, yeah.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.053
Plenty, over the years.

15:55.089 --> 15:57.523
Any particular jarhead
who had it out for your mom?

15:57.558 --> 16:00.726
I stayed as far away
from those lunatics as I could.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.999
I guess maybe if I didn't,
my mom would still be alive.

16:15.371 --> 16:18.538
These jars
explain the poison.

16:18.539 --> 16:20.939
So, old ceramics
contain small amounts

16:20.974 --> 16:24.175
of lead carbonate,
lead chromate, barium,

16:24.211 --> 16:25.277
cobalt.

16:25.312 --> 16:27.212
If a jar's glaze
was compromised,

16:27.247 --> 16:30.015
then the toxins could have
leached onto Leslie's hand.

16:30.050 --> 16:32.284
Well, I guess when people get
nostalgic for the good old days,

16:32.319 --> 16:34.886
they overlook things
like carcinogenic glaze.

16:34.922 --> 16:36.688
Why cookie jars?

16:36.723 --> 16:39.090
I mean, you know,<i> Star Wars</i>
figures I understand, but...

16:39.126 --> 16:40.559
Well, Andy Warhol's
cookie jar collection

16:40.594 --> 16:42.961
sold for $250,000
back in the '80s.

16:42.996 --> 16:44.729
Well, there's continuity
in collecting.

16:44.765 --> 16:46.731
I'm a collector.

16:46.767 --> 16:47.866
Wait, let me guess.

16:47.901 --> 16:50.068
Um... Grateful Dead bootlegs.

16:50.103 --> 16:51.102
I'm gonna go with...

16:51.138 --> 16:53.038
Pez dispensers.

16:53.073 --> 16:54.706
No, I collect

16:54.741 --> 16:57.275
the elements
of the periodic table.

16:57.311 --> 16:59.644
Uh, high purity samples,
no compounds or alloys.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.613
Where could you possibly
get scandium?

17:01.648 --> 17:03.982
Russian mobster named Pebbles.

17:04.017 --> 17:06.451
Uranium? Uh, technetium?

17:06.486 --> 17:08.954
Radioactive elements are tricky,
but I'm working on it.

17:08.989 --> 17:10.488
And I found

17:10.523 --> 17:12.190
a laceration to the tissue

17:12.224 --> 17:13.959
from the victim's right hand.

17:13.993 --> 17:15.160
Defensive wound?

17:15.194 --> 17:17.127
Possibly. It looks
pretty recent.

17:17.164 --> 17:18.997
I'll take a gander
at the metacarpals.

17:19.031 --> 17:20.598
Yeah, and I'll swab
the wound and see

17:20.634 --> 17:21.766
if I can find some particulates.

17:21.801 --> 17:23.034
How did you isolate rubidium?

17:23.069 --> 17:25.203
Wouldn't you like to know.

17:31.712 --> 17:33.445
Picking up to go. Brennan.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.615
Yeah, it'll be just
a few more minutes, dear.

17:53.967 --> 17:56.067
Pie.

17:56.103 --> 17:58.069
Comfort food.

17:58.105 --> 17:59.304
You getting takeout?

17:59.339 --> 18:00.705
Yeah.

18:00.741 --> 18:02.841
Eating here alone--
I don't know, I...

18:02.876 --> 18:05.644
Well, there's a seat
right here.

18:07.214 --> 18:10.382
Come on, Bones, we should
be able to have lunch together.

18:12.085 --> 18:13.085
Why not?

18:13.120 --> 18:14.719
Yeah.

18:14.755 --> 18:17.155
I'll eat here
now, please.

18:17.190 --> 18:18.590
You got it, hon.

18:22.696 --> 18:24.529
How's Christine?

18:24.564 --> 18:26.931
She misses you.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.466
But she's good.

18:30.437 --> 18:32.737
Look, whenever you want to talk
about me moving back...

18:32.773 --> 18:36.408
It's too soon, Booth,
you know that.

18:36.443 --> 18:37.803
Well, I'm going
to all my meetings.

18:37.811 --> 18:39.244
I have things under control.

18:39.279 --> 18:41.079
You're off to a good start.

18:41.114 --> 18:42.614
I'm... I'm happy for you.

18:42.649 --> 18:45.350
For us.

18:45.385 --> 18:48.019
Look, I don't want to make this
a bigger deal than what it is,

18:48.055 --> 18:50.155
all right? I made a mistake.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.856
Is that what you tell everyone
at your meetings?

18:51.892 --> 18:53.291
That it was just a mistake?

18:53.326 --> 18:56.261
You put me and Christine
in danger, Booth.

18:56.296 --> 18:58.563
Bones, please. I promise...

18:58.598 --> 18:59.898
It was more than just a mistake.

18:59.933 --> 19:01.032
Here you go,
sweetheart.

19:01.068 --> 19:02.188
Actually, on second thought,

19:02.202 --> 19:03.501
I will take it to go.

19:03.537 --> 19:06.104
Come on, Bones, really?

19:07.774 --> 19:10.675
It's too hard right now, Booth.

19:14.715 --> 19:16.848
I love you.

19:24.791 --> 19:26.825
<i> Cable records show</i>
<i>that she paid</i>

19:26.860 --> 19:29.027
extra for high-speed
Internet access.

19:29.062 --> 19:32.063
Yeah? Well, it worked.
Look at these bidding threads.

19:32.099 --> 19:33.631
Leslie was winning these

19:33.667 --> 19:35.200
cookie jar auctions
by milliseconds.

19:35.235 --> 19:36.835
Sounds like she was

19:36.870 --> 19:40.805
a major presence in
the cookie jar collecting world.

19:40.841 --> 19:42.307
I feel so stupid saying that.

19:42.342 --> 19:45.009
Yeah, well, look at this.

19:45.045 --> 19:48.146
Four days before her death,
Leslie posted

19:48.181 --> 19:49.981
a bunch of blistering reviews

19:50.016 --> 19:51.983
about another seller,
Cheryl McMichael.

19:52.018 --> 19:55.854
Criticism from a respectable
source could cripple

19:55.889 --> 19:57.689
a small business--
and it wasn't just

19:57.724 --> 19:59.357
online reviews. Look at this.

19:59.392 --> 20:02.360
Leslie was trying
to destroy Cheryl across

20:02.395 --> 20:04.429
every available platform.

20:04.464 --> 20:08.199
Her blog, newsletters,
the seller's Web site.

20:08.235 --> 20:11.603
And with Leslie out of the way,
Cheryl could save her business.

20:11.638 --> 20:13.938
Wow. Looks like a motive to me.

20:13.974 --> 20:15.907
Yeah.

20:20.614 --> 20:22.213
I noticed an injury

20:22.249 --> 20:23.748
on the frontal
and parietal bones

20:23.784 --> 20:25.416
when I was cleaning
the remains.

20:25.452 --> 20:28.820
It seems as though someone tried
to kill this woman before.

20:28.855 --> 20:31.589
There appears to be a glancing
gunshot wound to the skull.

20:31.625 --> 20:35.727
And there's a similar injury
on the right clavicle.

20:37.197 --> 20:38.730
Both wounds
show remodeling.

20:38.765 --> 20:41.366
I'd say about
20 years.

20:41.401 --> 20:43.434
Wow. That could be
why our victim's daughter

20:43.470 --> 20:45.703
never mentioned
her mom being shot.

20:45.739 --> 20:49.474
She was an infant at the time.
Perhaps she never knew.

20:49.509 --> 20:52.677
This injury to her prefrontal
cortex could explain

20:52.712 --> 20:55.079
the victim's
obsessive collecting.

20:55.115 --> 20:56.581
Well, there's plenty
of collectors

20:56.616 --> 20:58.016
that don't have
brain injuries.

20:58.051 --> 20:59.417
Still, a bullet
in this location

20:59.452 --> 21:01.319
would affect the part of
the brain that decides

21:01.354 --> 21:03.288
what is and isn't
worth saving.

21:03.323 --> 21:05.323
It's the source of addiction.

21:05.358 --> 21:06.791
It's destructive,

21:06.827 --> 21:10.128
for the addict
and everyone around them.

21:11.698 --> 21:13.097
Uh, please note

21:13.133 --> 21:15.066
the slight depression

21:15.101 --> 21:16.968
within the gunshot
wound, suggesting

21:17.003 --> 21:18.369
blunt force trauma.

21:18.405 --> 21:19.470
It appears to be perimortem,

21:19.506 --> 21:20.826
but the trauma pattern
is obscured

21:20.841 --> 21:22.340
by the hydraulic sanding.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.777
Yes. We should open up the
skull to take a closer look.

21:25.812 --> 21:27.712
In the meantime, please
work with Dr. Hodgins

21:27.747 --> 21:31.115
to determine the weapon
that caused the injury.

21:36.022 --> 21:37.922
I can't believe that this
McMichael woman's life

21:37.958 --> 21:40.258
could be ruined
by some online comments.

21:40.293 --> 21:41.893
According to
her tax records,

21:41.928 --> 21:44.295
Cheryl had a pretty robust
business selling memorabilia

21:44.331 --> 21:45.697
till Leslie started
bad-mouthing her.

21:49.269 --> 21:51.369
Booth.

21:52.739 --> 21:54.772
Yeah, all right, just
slow down, all right?

21:54.808 --> 21:56.641
Speak English.

21:56.676 --> 21:58.009
Right, okay.

21:58.044 --> 21:59.978
Got it.
So Hodgins found, uh, rust

22:00.013 --> 22:02.046
that was embedded
in the victim's hand.

22:10.223 --> 22:12.957
Oh! Oh!
Take it easy there, huh?

22:12.993 --> 22:14.192
Cheryl McMichael?

22:14.227 --> 22:15.860
Who wants to know?

22:15.896 --> 22:19.197
FBI. Special Agent Seeley Booth.
This here is Agent Aubrey.

22:19.232 --> 22:22.500
My online consignment business
is totally legit.

22:22.535 --> 22:25.146
I got a business license,
I pay sales tax...

22:25.213 --> 22:26.095
Booth.
Yeah?

22:26.119 --> 22:27.006
Look at this.

22:27.007 --> 22:29.073
Yeah. That's a lot of rust, huh?
Just like Hodgins said

22:29.109 --> 22:31.009
he found on Leslie's remains.

22:31.044 --> 22:33.778
"Leslie's remains"?
What's going on?

22:33.813 --> 22:36.381
Maybe you can answer that
for us.

22:40.313 --> 22:42.302
Look, Leslie and I were friends.

22:42.326 --> 22:44.101
I sold her over 50 cookie jars.

22:44.102 --> 22:44.581
Really?

22:44.582 --> 22:45.747
It's really the friends thing

22:45.782 --> 22:47.248
that I'm really struggling with.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.783
I mean, these reviews
that Leslie wrote about you

22:48.819 --> 22:49.951
don't seem so friendly.

22:49.986 --> 22:52.120
You really think I killed Leslie

22:52.155 --> 22:53.688
because of some bad reviews?

22:53.724 --> 22:56.157
Have you ever been
on the Internet?

22:56.193 --> 22:58.693
It's the land of
nasty, bitter people.

22:58.729 --> 22:59.894
I'm used to it.

22:59.930 --> 23:02.163
You must've done something
to set her off.

23:02.199 --> 23:03.898
Sure. Yeah.

23:03.934 --> 23:07.302
She wanted this antique Babe
Ruth cookie jar that I found.

23:07.337 --> 23:09.270
We arranged
for her to pick it up,

23:09.306 --> 23:11.439
but before she got there,
I got a better offer.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.341
Very friendly of you.

23:13.376 --> 23:16.244
The guy offered me
ridiculous money.

23:16.279 --> 23:18.780
I had to take it.
I'm a businesswoman.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.015
Who she hurt with her reviews.
We checked out your tax returns.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.817
For this year.

23:22.853 --> 23:25.353
Yeah, business was down because
there wasn't as much inventory.

23:25.388 --> 23:28.456
That's why I expanded
into all this other junk.

23:28.492 --> 23:30.959
Which is covered in rust
and some of which seems

23:30.994 --> 23:33.094
to have gotten into the victim.

23:33.130 --> 23:37.532
Take whatever you want and
test it or whatever you guys do.

23:37.567 --> 23:39.534
I didn't kill her.

23:39.569 --> 23:41.803
She was my friend.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.471
I was gonna try and find her

23:43.507 --> 23:46.674
another one
of those Babe Ruth jars.

24:12.335 --> 24:14.035
I was correct.

24:14.070 --> 24:16.137
The current
in the river

24:16.173 --> 24:18.606
smoothed out the
surface of the skull

24:18.642 --> 24:21.442
and obscured
the full extent

24:21.478 --> 24:22.710
of the depression
fracture.

24:22.746 --> 24:24.312
But by looking
inside the skull,

24:24.347 --> 24:28.249
we can see the full effect
of the blunt force trauma.

24:28.285 --> 24:30.118
Brilliant.

24:30.153 --> 24:31.986
Radiating and linear fractures
are preserved

24:32.022 --> 24:33.922
on the endocranial surface.

24:33.957 --> 24:36.124
I should have thought of that.

24:36.159 --> 24:38.827
Yes. But you're here to learn.

24:38.862 --> 24:40.261
True.

24:42.866 --> 24:45.733
I also want to apologize

24:45.769 --> 24:48.136
for my comments
earlier.

24:48.171 --> 24:53.174
Monogamy is a personal choice
and a popular one, at that.

24:55.478 --> 24:59.514
Well, I hope that you
and Agent Booth work it out.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.917
Yes.

25:04.788 --> 25:07.088
Hope.

25:13.230 --> 25:16.898
Hey, do you know
that I used to have this exact

25:16.933 --> 25:19.567
vintage Hubley plane
when I was a kid?

25:19.603 --> 25:22.570
Have you found anything,
aside from your lost childhood?

25:22.606 --> 25:25.106
Like rust that maybe matches
the rust in the victim?

25:25.141 --> 25:27.375
Well, you'd think so with
the amount on these suckers.

25:27.410 --> 25:29.711
I mean, I've got yellow rust,
I've got red rust,

25:29.746 --> 25:31.713
green rust,
brown rust...

25:31.748 --> 25:33.214
I get it. No matches.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.750
So, in all of this,
you have nothing.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.452
Got the plane.

25:37.487 --> 25:39.087
Hey.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.822
So I think I got something.

25:40.857 --> 25:42.423
Two months ago, Leslie tried

25:42.459 --> 25:44.792
to sell her entire collection
online.

25:44.828 --> 25:45.894
Tried to?

25:45.929 --> 25:47.562
Yeah, well, she
removed the post

25:47.597 --> 25:50.632
after only one day,
without accepting any offers.

25:50.667 --> 25:53.334
Those jars were her whole life.
Why would she try to sell them?

25:53.370 --> 25:54.669
My guess is she wouldn't have.

25:54.704 --> 25:57.772
Not unless
it was life or death.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.882
I mapped the
spider-web fractures

26:07.918 --> 26:10.285
on the interior frontal bone
on the skull.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.988
The injuries are definitely a
result of two separate blows,

26:14.024 --> 26:17.025
one perimortem
and one postmortem.

26:17.060 --> 26:20.495
Could the perimortem blow
indicate cause of death?

26:20.530 --> 26:25.199
Not definitively, but I can
give you weapon parameters.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.434
Longer curvilinear fractures

26:26.469 --> 26:29.170
on the temporal
and parietal bones

26:29.205 --> 26:31.539
indicate a heavy
cylindrical object.

26:31.574 --> 26:36.010
And the differentiated impact
here suggests

26:36.046 --> 26:38.846
a punt or dimple at the base.

26:38.882 --> 26:41.983
Could that be consistent
with a cookie jar?

26:42.018 --> 26:43.184
Possibly.

26:43.219 --> 26:45.286
Okay, I found traces

26:45.322 --> 26:47.689
of fiberglass insulation
in the victim's lungs.

26:47.724 --> 26:50.992
Not enough to be cause of death,
but I wouldn't expect to see it

26:51.027 --> 26:54.062
in someone unless they'd spent
a lot of time in an old attic.

26:54.097 --> 26:56.130
Old as in the
victim's townhouse?

26:56.166 --> 26:57.532
Exactly.

26:57.567 --> 26:59.701
And if the murder weapon
<i>was</i> a cookie jar,

26:59.736 --> 27:01.836
we may have our crime scene.

27:04.074 --> 27:06.140
Have I mentioned
that attics freak me out?

27:06.176 --> 27:09.110
Aw. Superman is
scared of the dark?

27:09.145 --> 27:11.646
Well, spiders, really.
Anything crawly.

27:11.681 --> 27:13.982
That's my Kryptonite.
Why?

27:14.017 --> 27:15.416
They're so...

27:15.452 --> 27:17.018
Creepy?
Yep, that's what they are.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.420
Don't worry.

27:19.456 --> 27:21.556
I'll protect you.

27:31.434 --> 27:34.068
Bingo. Fiberglass.

27:34.104 --> 27:36.070
Ooh.

27:36.106 --> 27:38.172
Yeah. There is
definitely blood

27:38.208 --> 27:40.641
on that nail.
And rust.

27:40.677 --> 27:42.877
Could be a match for what
was found on the victim's hand.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.579
Hard to believe
that it isn't.

27:44.614 --> 27:46.581
We're kind of good at this,
aren't we?

27:46.616 --> 27:49.350
Booth and Brennan 2.0.

27:49.386 --> 27:52.587
I mean, except for the being
married and having babies part.

27:52.622 --> 27:54.088
Or having any kind
of sex at all.

27:54.124 --> 27:55.857
Right. Yeah, no, obviously.

27:55.892 --> 27:58.126
Up here with the fiberglass,
you know, the heavy breathing.

27:58.161 --> 28:00.628
I meant anywhere.
Right.

28:00.663 --> 28:04.565
So what's the victim doing
crawling around up here?

28:06.503 --> 28:07.869
Did you hear that?

28:07.904 --> 28:09.704
I think
someone's up here.

28:09.739 --> 28:12.273
Right. Get behind me.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.915
This is kind of exciting.

28:28.558 --> 28:30.064
FBI! All right?

28:30.088 --> 28:31.827
Come out or I'll shoot!
Okay, no, no, no, no!

28:31.828 --> 28:33.428
Don't-don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Please don't shoot!

28:33.463 --> 28:34.629
Please-please don't shoot!

28:34.664 --> 28:37.732
I'm gonna stand
up, okay?

28:40.770 --> 28:42.070
Okay.

28:48.529 --> 28:51.030
<i> This is not looking good</i>
<i>for you, Mr. Simon.</i>

28:51.065 --> 28:52.865
I mean, you actually got caught
with your hand

28:52.900 --> 28:54.266
in the cookie jar.

28:54.302 --> 28:55.835
I didn't kill anyone.

28:55.870 --> 28:57.336
You were locked in the attic,
you understand,

28:57.372 --> 28:58.838
where the victim
was assaulted.

28:58.873 --> 29:01.040
I wasn't locked in the attic.

29:01.075 --> 29:03.309
I was waiting
for an opportunity to sneak out.

29:03.344 --> 29:05.011
How long were
you in there?

29:05.046 --> 29:07.747
A day or so.

29:07.782 --> 29:09.215
Leslie's kid
wouldn't leave.

29:09.250 --> 29:10.816
I didn't want to get caught
for trespassing.

29:10.852 --> 29:12.051
Trespassing?

29:12.086 --> 29:13.219
That's the least
of your problems.

29:13.254 --> 29:14.553
Will you sit down?
Sit.

29:14.589 --> 29:17.256
I-I know.
I know it was wrong being there.

29:17.291 --> 29:20.026
But I love the Babe.

29:20.061 --> 29:22.661
I mean, I love him.

29:22.697 --> 29:24.830
Babe Ruth is...

29:24.866 --> 29:26.999
I mean, the
way that I...

29:27.035 --> 29:30.236
the way I feel about him,
I just...

29:30.271 --> 29:32.505
Yeah. You love him.
Yeah. We got it.

29:32.540 --> 29:35.074
Okay, good. So-so you...
so you understand.

29:35.109 --> 29:37.176
No. Not at all.

29:37.211 --> 29:40.212
I feel it's important
to keep his memory alive

29:40.248 --> 29:43.783
and to collect the things
that honored his life.

29:43.818 --> 29:45.484
You know,
I'm like...

29:45.520 --> 29:48.154
I'm like the gatekeeper.

29:48.189 --> 29:50.189
You do realize that
you really are digging yourself

29:50.224 --> 29:51.757
a big hole here, right?

29:51.793 --> 29:55.761
Y-You're admitting
to breaking into her home.

29:55.797 --> 29:57.296
No. I didn't break in.

29:57.331 --> 29:58.464
The front door was unlocked.

29:58.499 --> 30:00.433
And I <i> was</i> gonna
retrieve

30:00.468 --> 30:03.436
my Babe jar,
the one she stole from me.

30:03.471 --> 30:04.751
How'd Leslie get her hands
on it?

30:04.772 --> 30:06.105
Oh.
All right.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.240
Sit. No.
Please, just stay there.

30:08.276 --> 30:10.743
So, after I bought it
from Cheryl,

30:10.778 --> 30:12.711
she found out where I lived

30:12.747 --> 30:15.014
and she kept showing up
trying to buy it.

30:15.049 --> 30:16.982
And one day I came home,

30:17.018 --> 30:21.053
the Babe was gone, and suddenly
she stops pestering me.

30:21.089 --> 30:22.369
And you didn't report the theft?

30:22.390 --> 30:23.923
I called the cops!

30:23.958 --> 30:26.525
But I didn't have "evidence"
of a break-in.

30:26.561 --> 30:28.494
I couldn't "prove" it was her.

30:28.529 --> 30:30.162
How did she get into your house?

30:30.198 --> 30:31.730
Beats me. I don't have an alarm,

30:31.766 --> 30:33.833
but the place was locked
and dead-bolted.

30:33.868 --> 30:35.301
Nobody has keys but me.

30:35.336 --> 30:36.735
Wow, that must have really
"pissed you off."

30:36.771 --> 30:37.837
You better believe it.

30:37.872 --> 30:38.671
Yeah.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.973
Hmm.

30:41.008 --> 30:43.843
That, uh... that didn't sound
so good, did it?

30:43.878 --> 30:47.480
Not really, no.

30:49.851 --> 30:52.418
Don't get up.

30:52.453 --> 30:54.353
Just stay right there.

30:54.388 --> 30:57.323
What do you think?

30:57.358 --> 30:59.158
Guy's not a killer.

30:59.193 --> 31:00.860
Seemed kind of crazy though.

31:00.895 --> 31:02.394
Look, get DCPD
on the line

31:02.430 --> 31:04.063
and follow up on his
story, all right?

31:04.098 --> 31:05.264
Where are you going?

31:05.299 --> 31:06.866
Yeah, I got to take care
of business.

31:06.901 --> 31:08.033
Well, you need backup?

31:08.069 --> 31:09.902
Not this time, all right?

31:16.344 --> 31:18.344
<i>So I just talked to DCPD.</i>

31:18.379 --> 31:21.347
Turns out Scott
Simon's story tracks.

31:21.382 --> 31:22.681
There was
a break-in?

31:22.717 --> 31:24.183
Well, he definitely
reported one

31:24.218 --> 31:26.152
and even reported
the cookie jar missing.

31:26.187 --> 31:29.922
So it looks like
Scott isn't our guy.

31:29.957 --> 31:31.290
Well, I may have something.

31:31.325 --> 31:32.892
I've been wondering
why the victim

31:32.927 --> 31:34.860
listed her entire
collection for sale

31:34.896 --> 31:35.995
online.

31:36.030 --> 31:37.229
Financial trouble?

31:37.265 --> 31:38.831
Not that I could find.

31:38.866 --> 31:42.101
But look at what I did find
on her Facebook page.

31:42.136 --> 31:45.237
That's the victim,

31:45.273 --> 31:47.173
fifth from the left.

31:47.208 --> 31:49.675
This photo was posted
from Orlando on the same day

31:49.710 --> 31:51.710
that her entire jar
collection was listed

31:51.746 --> 31:55.314
online from her home computer
I.P. address.

31:55.349 --> 31:57.349
So you think someone else
used her home computer

31:57.385 --> 31:58.784
while she was out of town

31:58.819 --> 32:00.352
to sell her
collection?

32:00.388 --> 32:02.521
And guess who was still
living at home at the time.

32:02.557 --> 32:04.456
The daughter.
I need to talk to

32:04.492 --> 32:05.691
the victim's daughter again.

32:08.162 --> 32:09.695
One question,
Agent Aubrey.

32:09.730 --> 32:11.096
Sure.

32:11.132 --> 32:13.632
I called Booth
to talk about the case.

32:13.668 --> 32:15.768
Uh, he didn't pick up.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.637
He said he had some
business to take care of.

32:18.673 --> 32:19.872
A meeting?

32:19.907 --> 32:22.141
Uh, he didn't say. I'm sorry.

32:22.176 --> 32:24.577
He-He's doing
well though.

32:24.612 --> 32:26.946
Really.

32:33.487 --> 32:36.522
It works if you work it.
See you next time.

32:38.092 --> 32:39.792
Hey, Booth.
Yeah?

32:39.827 --> 32:41.994
I thought you said
you were gonna stand up tonight.

32:42.029 --> 32:44.496
So many people got up. I didn't
want the meeting to run late.

32:44.532 --> 32:47.399
We're all friends here, Booth.
We've all screwed up.

32:47.435 --> 32:49.401
Yeah, I get that.
That's why I'm here.

32:49.437 --> 32:53.606
You think if you don't talk,
that means it didn't happen?

32:53.641 --> 32:55.040
Of course not.

32:55.076 --> 32:57.309
We need you to get it
all out in the open.

32:57.345 --> 32:59.511
You need to tell us
what you did.

32:59.547 --> 33:01.947
Look, I got to go take care
of something, all right?

33:01.983 --> 33:05.684
I'll, uh...
I'll see you next time.

33:12.199 --> 33:15.491
No, I loved my mother.
I would never hurt her.

33:15.492 --> 33:18.297
Trying to sell your mother's cookie
jar collection would hurt her big-time.

33:18.298 --> 33:20.232
But I didn't go
through with it.

33:20.267 --> 33:21.566
Maybe you realized you'd get
more from your mother's

33:21.602 --> 33:23.535
life insurance
than selling those cookie jars.

33:23.570 --> 33:26.872
I took it offline because
it was the wrong thing to do.

33:26.907 --> 33:28.807
Right, because that would make
you look like a good person

33:28.842 --> 33:30.108
before you killed your mother.

33:30.143 --> 33:33.578
I <i> am</i> a good person.

33:33.614 --> 33:36.081
My dad left when I was little.

33:36.116 --> 33:38.216
I barely remember him.

33:38.252 --> 33:41.453
You know, and then my mom
started collecting.

33:41.488 --> 33:45.790
I just wanted to be as important
to her as those damn jars were.

33:47.527 --> 33:49.794
Why'd you change your mind?

33:49.830 --> 33:52.197
'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

33:52.232 --> 33:55.233
I mean, yeah, sure, sometimes
I feel like one, but...

33:55.269 --> 33:57.035
I don't know.

33:57.070 --> 33:59.404
I realized
it was time to move on.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.409
I guess
I realized I could love her

34:04.444 --> 34:06.978
even if she couldn't love me.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.985
You know what? It...

34:14.021 --> 34:17.489
It wasn't about
your mother not loving you.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.592
Did you realize
that, um...

34:20.627 --> 34:24.329
that she was shot
in a mugging 20 years ago?

34:24.364 --> 34:25.730
Shot?

34:25.766 --> 34:27.364
Yeah.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.867
No.

34:28.902 --> 34:30.802
No, she never said anything
about that.

34:30.837 --> 34:35.473
The gunshot wound to her head
would explain her obsession.

34:35.509 --> 34:37.976
It wasn't your fault.

34:38.011 --> 34:40.411
She was an addict.

34:40.447 --> 34:43.848
It had nothing to do with you.

34:49.623 --> 34:52.223
Ms. Warren, why didn't
you note the small nick

34:52.259 --> 34:53.858
on the right clavicle?

34:53.893 --> 34:55.460
I must have missed it

34:55.495 --> 34:57.575
because it's obscured
by the remodeled gunshot wound.

34:57.597 --> 34:59.497
But that wound
shows no remodeling.

34:59.533 --> 35:01.299
It's perimortem.

35:01.335 --> 35:03.835
Do you ever miss anything?

35:03.870 --> 35:06.638
Well, no one's
perfect, Ms. Warren.

35:06.673 --> 35:08.073
Very humble.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.441
But I come very close.

35:09.476 --> 35:11.009
That wound appears
to be connected

35:11.044 --> 35:14.045
to this damage to
the cranial vault.

35:14.081 --> 35:16.514
Oh, before I
forget, Ms. Warren,

35:16.550 --> 35:18.249
I have something for you.

35:18.285 --> 35:19.684
Uh, more X-rays?
Yes.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.987
But this has nothing to do
with the case.

35:22.022 --> 35:23.022
It's a bone scan.

35:23.023 --> 35:25.256
In nuclear medicine,

35:25.292 --> 35:26.958
the element technetium is

35:26.994 --> 35:31.396
injected into patients to
measure unusual bone rebuilding.

35:31.431 --> 35:33.398
Uh, the short half-life of
technetium makes it impossible

35:33.433 --> 35:34.866
to gather a pure sample.

35:34.901 --> 35:36.835
Which is why I thought

35:36.870 --> 35:40.872
this snapshot of technetium
in action, while not as good

35:40.907 --> 35:42.474
as an actual sample,

35:42.509 --> 35:45.543
could complement
your periodic table collection.

35:45.579 --> 35:47.345
I'm touched.

35:47.381 --> 35:48.913
Wow.

35:48.949 --> 35:50.715
Thank you.

35:50.751 --> 35:55.854
I realize how quickly
relationships can change and...

35:55.889 --> 35:59.791
how important it is to value
those we have right now.

36:02.629 --> 36:04.729
I guess...

36:04.765 --> 36:06.564
what I'm saying is...

36:06.600 --> 36:08.299
I know.

36:08.335 --> 36:09.934
Back at ya.

36:12.305 --> 36:14.272
Thanks.

36:16.276 --> 36:22.113
Um... could a diagonal blow
cause the impact evidence

36:22.149 --> 36:24.549
on the left frontal bone
and right clavicle?

36:24.584 --> 36:28.053
Yes. Which means
the murder weapon would have

36:28.088 --> 36:30.789
had to slice
through the subclavian artery.

36:30.824 --> 36:32.957
Causing the victim to bleed to death.
Mm-hmm.

36:32.993 --> 36:35.360
Uh, let's see.

36:35.395 --> 36:38.329
Huh. Look at that.

36:38.365 --> 36:41.599
There's something caught
in the crevice of the wound.

36:41.635 --> 36:45.770
Oh. It looks like
a shard of green glass.

36:45.806 --> 36:47.806
I hear someone
discussing particulates?

36:47.841 --> 36:50.408
Perfect timing,
Dr. Hodgins.

36:50.444 --> 36:52.844
What do you
make of this?

36:57.217 --> 36:59.584
Well, judging
from the density,

36:59.619 --> 37:01.286
it's pressure-ware glass,

37:01.321 --> 37:04.055
made to withstand
the force of carbonation.

37:04.091 --> 37:07.559
The murder weapon is
a champagne bottle.

37:07.594 --> 37:10.061
A thick-walled,
curvilinear side

37:10.097 --> 37:11.863
terminating in a punted
bottom is consistent

37:11.898 --> 37:13.498
with the fracture pattern.

37:13.533 --> 37:15.266
And if the bottle broke
on impact,

37:15.302 --> 37:17.635
a shard could have sliced
the subclavian artery.

37:17.671 --> 37:19.737
But we don't have
a champagne bottle

37:19.773 --> 37:21.673
in any of
the collected evidence.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.275
I'm not so sure about that.

37:27.514 --> 37:29.214
So, I remember
seeing this bottle

37:29.249 --> 37:31.282
in the water
where the body was found.

37:31.318 --> 37:33.818
But does the glass
in the wound match?

37:33.854 --> 37:36.387
Definitely.
Hate to step on your toes, Curly,

37:36.423 --> 37:39.991
but wouldn't being underwater
destroy all trace evidence?

37:40.026 --> 37:41.459
Well, that is where
my Vacuum Metal

37:41.495 --> 37:42.861
Deposition Chamber comes in.

37:42.896 --> 37:45.997
So this can retrieve
any surviving fingerprints,

37:46.032 --> 37:48.500
even after prolonged
immersion in water.

37:48.535 --> 37:50.135
I'm being punked, right?
No.

37:50.170 --> 37:52.403
Not at all. Here, you do
the honors and tell me.

37:52.439 --> 37:54.839
Just spin that middle one
to the right.

37:54.875 --> 37:57.308
Yup.

37:57.344 --> 38:00.311
So, aerosolized gold
evaporates,

38:00.347 --> 38:03.348
creating a thin film
which actually gets absorbed

38:03.383 --> 38:06.284
by the sebaceous surfaces
left by the fingerprint ridges.

38:06.319 --> 38:08.620
And coats the
non-ridged surfaces.

38:08.655 --> 38:12.023
And voilà, we have
ourselves a fingerprint.

38:17.564 --> 38:19.297
Your fingerprints
are in the system

38:19.332 --> 38:21.032
because you have
a locksmith license.

38:21.067 --> 38:23.601
Fine. So what?

38:23.637 --> 38:27.238
We found the champagne bottle
you used to kill Leslie.

38:27.274 --> 38:29.307
We were able
to lift prints from it,

38:29.342 --> 38:31.876
as well as traces
of Leslie's blood.

38:31.912 --> 38:33.545
Leslie knew that
you were a locksmith,

38:33.580 --> 38:35.146
made you break
into Scott's home

38:35.182 --> 38:37.015
and steal
the Babe Ruth cookie jar.

38:37.050 --> 38:38.483
What went wrong?

38:44.824 --> 38:47.125
I thought she loved me.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.294
But after she
got that jar,

38:49.329 --> 38:51.629
I... I meant nothing to her.

38:51.665 --> 38:53.731
She was like a drug addict
or something.

38:53.767 --> 38:55.099
What about the champagne bottle?

38:56.903 --> 38:59.103
I brought it over
a couple of days later.

38:59.139 --> 39:00.939
I was trying to win her back.

39:00.974 --> 39:03.374
But you didn't.
She rejected you once again.

39:03.410 --> 39:04.475
So you killed her.

39:04.511 --> 39:07.278
It was an accident!

39:07.314 --> 39:09.414
I tried talking to her,

39:09.449 --> 39:12.016
but she was cleaning
those stupid jars.

39:12.052 --> 39:13.751
So I took the champagne bottle,

39:13.787 --> 39:15.887
and I swung it
to smash the jars,

39:15.922 --> 39:18.356
but she lunged out in front
to protect them.

39:18.391 --> 39:21.326
To protect the things she didn't
realize were ruining her life.

39:21.361 --> 39:24.996
The bottle broke,
the glass cut her throat.

39:25.031 --> 39:26.898
There was so much blood...

39:26.933 --> 39:30.235
Oh, there was so much blood.

39:30.270 --> 39:33.037
God.

39:33.073 --> 39:36.107
I'm so sorry.

39:59.399 --> 40:01.132
Oh.

40:01.167 --> 40:03.434
Wow. This is like a dream
I had once.

40:03.470 --> 40:05.336
Uh, happy
hour was about to end,

40:05.372 --> 40:07.105
and I didn't know
what you liked,

40:07.140 --> 40:08.606
so I just got
everything.

40:08.642 --> 40:10.508
That is exactly what I like.

40:10.543 --> 40:12.577
I also didn't know
what you drank,

40:12.612 --> 40:16.080
so I got you a beer,
margarita and a Coke.

40:16.116 --> 40:19.651
I feel like
you can see into my soul.

40:19.686 --> 40:22.353
Well, dig in.

40:22.389 --> 40:24.122
To our, uh, first case together.

40:24.157 --> 40:27.792
So that's what this
is, celebrating work.

40:27.827 --> 40:31.262
'Cause I was afraid you
might think it was a date.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.431
A date?

40:33.466 --> 40:36.301
No. Why would I think that?

40:36.336 --> 40:38.336
Would I be pounding
meatball sliders

40:38.371 --> 40:39.937
on a date?

40:39.973 --> 40:41.839
We're colleagues.

40:41.875 --> 40:43.508
We're friends.

40:43.543 --> 40:45.710
That's it.

40:45.745 --> 40:47.378
Well, they look good.

40:47.414 --> 40:50.315
Thank you.

40:50.350 --> 40:54.052
So, uh, do you think Booth and
Brennan are gonna get a divorce?

40:54.087 --> 40:56.821
Those two? Never.

40:56.856 --> 40:59.090
Pretty definite
there, Superman.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.392
Well, you know,
Sweets wrote a book about them.

41:01.428 --> 41:03.394
He said that
it was their friendship

41:03.430 --> 41:05.730
that was the foundation
of their relationship.

41:05.765 --> 41:07.465
Not the fickle nature of love.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.033
Oh.

41:09.069 --> 41:12.103
So it's because
they're colleagues, friends?

41:21.481 --> 41:23.281
It's good work, Bones.

41:23.316 --> 41:25.283
We've always made
a good team.

41:25.318 --> 41:26.851
Right.

41:26.886 --> 41:29.821
Give Christine a kiss for me,
and tell her I love her.

41:29.856 --> 41:32.390
Of course.

41:33.827 --> 41:36.260
If you wanted to come by,

41:36.296 --> 41:39.630
read her a book, tuck her in?

41:41.368 --> 41:44.135
Thanks, but I-I can't tonight.

41:44.170 --> 41:46.871
Maybe tomorrow.

41:48.775 --> 41:49.874
Sure.

41:51.644 --> 41:53.778
See you tomorrow.

41:56.616 --> 41:59.083
<i>Well, I guess if no one</i>

41:59.119 --> 42:00.451
has anything else to say,

42:00.487 --> 42:01.919
I guess we're done
for the evening.

42:01.955 --> 42:04.422
Thank you all for coming.
Hi.

42:10.096 --> 42:12.163
Uh...

42:13.700 --> 42:15.600
I'm, uh...

42:15.635 --> 42:19.137
My name is Seeley,
and I have a gambling addiction.

42:19.172 --> 42:22.140
Welcome, Seeley.

42:22.175 --> 42:25.843
I'm here today because, uh...

42:25.879 --> 42:28.980
I want to make things right,
I want to get my life back.

42:29.015 --> 42:33.217
You see, I've, uh...

42:33.253 --> 42:36.187
I've hurt a lot of people
in my life,

42:36.222 --> 42:38.322
especially my family.

42:38.358 --> 42:42.860
I've, uh, betrayed them
and put them in danger.

42:43.777 --> 42:46.477
So...

42:46.513 --> 42:49.480
I'm here to find a
sense of resolution

42:49.516 --> 42:51.949
with that, so I can better
understand... myself.
