Mel, what is it'?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.868
Excuse me, sweetheart. I have to...

01:38.665 --> 01:42.545
Oh, no, my dear. I've been waiting
for my gift far too long.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.315
Honey, I'm back! I've got a carp.

<i>We have here Kazik from Warsaw,
on the line.</i>

02:09.997 --> 02:14.002
- What would you like to ask Santa for'?
- I want my dad. To <i>thank him.</i>

02:14.167 --> 02:16.875
I was sad, and my dad
remembered about me.

02:17.037 --> 02:21.816
- I've got a Superman. But with no head.
- Maybe he has a great heart instead.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.081
That happens.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.191
Has your dad given you
a Christmas gift already?

02:27.347 --> 02:29.953
<i>Yes, for the last year.
Dad has sent it.</i>

02:30.117 --> 02:32.757
So this year you'll thank him yourself.

02:32.919 --> 02:35.661
Will he spend
the Christmas Eve with you'?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.961
<i>- He's far away.
-l'm sorry.</i>

02:38.125 --> 02:41.129
<i>We'd like to be together
on Christmas Eve.</i>

02:41.294 --> 02:43.865
Your dad is missing you for sure.

02:44.031 --> 02:49.572
<i>And if he can't come, he must have
very important things to do there.</i>

02:49.736 --> 02:53.013
He's saving the world?

02:53.173 --> 02:57.519
It's quite possible. Greetings
to Dad, who's saving the world.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.386
And who loves
his little son Kazik very much.

03:17.497 --> 03:23.470
IT IS NICE TO SEE YOU

03:42.789 --> 03:45.360
<i>Thanks to you we've managed</i>

03:45.525 --> 03:49.632
<i>to collect the money for Malgorzata's
surgery in Switzerland.</i>

03:49.796 --> 03:53.471
<i>- My contribution was minimal.
- Don't be so modest.</i>

03:53.633 --> 03:56.671
I wrote the song because
someone inspired me.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.046
And Tosia here
took care of the rest.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.711
<i>We owe our success to her
and her incredible energy</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:06.619
<i>and her faith
that her mom will get well.</i>

04:06.780 --> 04:08.953
<i>Don't be so modest, Tosia.</i>

04:09.783 --> 04:15.131
<i>Malgosia, we wish you health,
and beautiful and merry Christmas.</i>

04:15.288 --> 04:18.166
<i>- And get back to us soon.
- Mom has to stay</i>

04:18.325 --> 04:20.964
in the hospital until the operation.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.393
A suicider.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.662
Or perhaps not'?

05:00.500 --> 05:01.911
And? You loser!

05:03.670 --> 05:05.343
"Loser?"

05:09.009 --> 05:11.216
Come on, boss. We're on.

05:12.612 --> 05:13.716
Come on!

05:32.933 --> 05:34.970
Give it back.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.013
A present for you.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.060
<i>Call us. Santa is waiting
for your letters.</i>

05:53.220 --> 05:55.166
<i>There isn't much time left.</i>

05:55.322 --> 05:58.792
Remember, you can't buy happiness.
This is the bad news.

05:58.959 --> 06:03.203
The good one is, you can get happiness
for free, if only love finds you.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.678
Misiek's eyes look like dinner
plates now, but it's true.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.336
- Fiddle-faddle.
- When loves finds you,

06:09.502 --> 06:12.915
-you have Christmas every day.
- Don't believe him.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.212
Men are like stupid sheep.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.854
Excuse me, pigs.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.082
<i>I see that Misiek is ready
to turn off the mic.</i>

06:20.247 --> 06:21.453
ls it on?

06:21.615 --> 06:24.926
<i>You're the best presents
for one another.</i>

06:25.085 --> 06:28.123
Misiek, don't look at me like that.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.928
- Dad got carried away.
- My son <i>Kostek</i> says that.

06:31.091 --> 06:35.597
He asked me to dedicate a song
to a young and lovely lady.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.107
<i>Wiktoria, especially for you,
from Kostek:</i>

06:39.266 --> 06:41.212
<i>"What the world needs now."</i>

06:44.871 --> 06:47.477
Well, master, my respect.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.247
Kiddo has fallen in love.
First love.

06:50.410 --> 06:55.359
Flowers and hearts. I can't stand
listening about Wiktoria any longer.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.371
Oh, my Romeo.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.167
It must be Victoria.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.846
Hello?

07:23.009 --> 07:24.750
<i>How are you, honey?</i>

07:25.178 --> 07:27.784
<i>- Hello? Are you there?
- Yes. Hi.</i>

07:27.948 --> 07:31.259
ls anything the matter?
Has Kostek gotten into mischief?

07:31.418 --> 07:33.227
- No. Why?
- You're silent.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.399
I'm busy now. I need to go. Bye.

07:38.725 --> 07:39.863
Bye.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.728
Where are you going?
To what mountains?

08:10.890 --> 08:13.871
- The Tatras.
-lt's out of the question.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.673
I can't...

08:16.096 --> 08:18.667
I am not going to give you your coat.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.869
How much chance do you give me'?

08:21.034 --> 08:24.481
If you give up the treatment... Zero!

08:32.578 --> 08:35.559
I have little time... as you know.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.065
Thank you.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.932
Merry Christmas.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.574
Merry Christmas.

08:56.503 --> 09:00.007
- Have you called Mom?
- She doesn't answer her phone.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.676
- She's depressed.
- She watched it for sure.

09:02.842 --> 09:06.790
I doubt it. What matters now is
that she makes it to Switzerland.

09:06.946 --> 09:10.553
- Everything will be all right.
- Give my greetings to Monika.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.788
- Love to Mom.
- Merry Christmas.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.159
Merry Christmas.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.761
- No, not here.
-lt's good.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.528
- Only here.
- Mom.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.875
Oh, so sweet! You have a date
with a school student?

09:30.036 --> 09:33.415
- It's not your business.
- Anything is possible on the net.

09:33.573 --> 09:38.716
- Don't be so envious!
- Of what for that matter?

09:38.878 --> 09:42.257
- My figure.
- Mine will be better when I'm your age.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.554
Mine was better when I was your age too.

09:45.952 --> 09:49.263
He'll drop dead when he sees you.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.232
Wow! I'm dating the wrong Lisiecka.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.474
- Smart ass!
- Oh, Mom!

09:58.798 --> 10:00.971
- Is it cute'?
- Yes.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.912
Hey!

10:07.707 --> 10:10.381
-I'll check once again.
-lt's very important.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.420
I know.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.124
- I hate Christmas.
- Mel, I have a client!

10:16.449 --> 10:19.396
My queen, please,
give me 200 in advance.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.130
- Let rne work. -What's wrong?
-l'm in a hurry.

10:23.289 --> 10:27.704
- You got some yesterday.
- Please, have mercy.

10:28.695 --> 10:33.007
-9a Pelplinska Street...
-Apartment 3.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.646
- Whose address is it'?
- Mine.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.045
- Any problem?
- No. I'll take it.

10:39.205 --> 10:42.311
- But I won't take you.
- Why? What's wrong with me?

10:42.442 --> 10:45.286
- You scare kids.
- Whose?

10:45.745 --> 10:49.352
Not mine, as I won't hire you.
Even if you pay me.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.622
But I don't have anyone else.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.699
In that case - thank you, no.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.133
- Sir, wait!
- Mel!

11:03.296 --> 11:07.039
- You have to be in the Arkadia Mall.
- Sir, don't get offended.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.579
Give me 200 zloty,
and I'll get you a Santa costume.

11:10.737 --> 11:14.378
You might not like me
but you want your kid happy.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.786
My son turns 4 today too.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.395
How do you know how old my son is'?

11:25.552 --> 11:28.499
Santa knows everything
about every kid.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.171
And remember: Kazik is not
your kid. He's mine.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.605
Got it?

11:40.733 --> 11:43.077
My son.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.680
- Mel?
-l'm going to see my son.

11:52.579 --> 11:56.026
- What about the nativity scene?
- Sheep is missing.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.788
But I know a guy who breeds ostriches.

11:59.319 --> 12:02.926
Vladi, relax. I'm almost there.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.826
Yes, Matylda is with me.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.632
I'll be there in 5 minutes. Bye.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.043
Redo!

12:17.403 --> 12:19.007
Redo!

12:34.387 --> 12:37.800
- What are you doing?
- Will you keep an eye on it?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.863
Merry Christmas!

12:50.203 --> 12:51.841
I'm sorry!

13:25.905 --> 13:27.885
<i>Magma!</i>

13:28.408 --> 13:29.512
<i>Magma!</i>

13:45.758 --> 13:47.032
Magda.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.873
Hi.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.676
Hi.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.850
Don't you really recognize me?

14:09.048 --> 14:11.289
Last summer, Mazuria,

14:11.451 --> 14:13.954
Mikolajki, a sailing boat.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.164
- That's you.
- Oh, yes.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.305
On a yacht.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.638
- You shagged me.
- What?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.713
Oh, it wasn't you?

14:31.237 --> 14:33.547
Of course, it was you!

14:33.840 --> 14:37.219
Robert Redo Banosiewicz.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.250
Magda.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.958
- What are you doing?
- I was passing through Warsaw

14:43.116 --> 14:46.222
with my sheep Matylda
and I saw you.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.595
My heart was pounding,
I felt butterflies in my stomach,

14:49.756 --> 14:51.463
I crashed my car

14:51.624 --> 14:55.037
and now I'm running
around the Mall to...

14:56.095 --> 14:57.506
to...

15:03.903 --> 15:06.179
We have to meet one day.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.377
I texted you,
you didn't answer.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.857
I've changed my number.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.457
Have you?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.355
What did you write?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.393
It doesn't matter.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.765
- May I?
- Oh, you're here.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.636
This is Magda.
We ran into each other.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.641
And you wanted to invite her
to our wedding.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.750
I must be going.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.415
- Merry Christmas.
- To you too.

15:50.516 --> 15:51.756
Mew--

15:54.887 --> 15:57.891
Come on, we have shopping to do.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.207
Morn?

16:10.369 --> 16:14.579
- What's the matter?
- I want to thank you a lot.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.848
<i>- Did you</i> watch <i>it?
- You were wonderful as usual.</i>

16:20.012 --> 16:23.550
And you reminded rne of our trip
to the mountains.

16:23.916 --> 16:27.659
- And I grew my wings.
- We'll go there <i>again, I</i> promise.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.891
We've collected the whole
amount for the surgery.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.706
<i>- I'll see you in the hospital.</i>
- I <i>love you. Bye.</i>

16:37.330 --> 16:38.604
Bye.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.911
What are you talking about?

16:49.175 --> 16:52.088
Malgosia, get back to the hospital!

16:53.679 --> 16:55.590
Why are you laughing?

16:57.717 --> 17:01.290
Okay, wait.
I'll be there right away.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.635
I don't want to take Kazik with me.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.000
What a shitty day.
Karol left an hour ago.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.698
He's not answering his phone.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.369
Oh, I think he's back.
I'll be there soon.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.747
- Mel.
- Hi!

17:26.913 --> 17:29.223
- Were you a good girl?
- You'll get

17:29.382 --> 17:31.225
no more money.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.558
Relax, darling. I have a job to do here.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.257
Perhaps you need help watching Kazik.

17:37.423 --> 17:40.427
For 2 years,
you haven't given any sign of life.

17:40.593 --> 17:44.166
- It felt good.
- You've thrown me away.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.504
- Why should I give you any signs?
- Mel?

17:47.667 --> 17:50.045
I was a year and a half with you.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.682
You were like a big kid.

17:52.838 --> 17:55.045
I wanted to marry you!

17:55.207 --> 17:57.915
Now you mention that?
Pop in in 2 years.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.581
All right... It didn't work for us,
but Kazik needs a father.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.956
That's why I bought him
a present from you last year.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.791
You owe me a hundred.
And now go.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.766
- My little punk.
- Kazik, do you remember him?

18:14.994 --> 18:18.771
- See? He recognized rne.
- Whatever. We need to see your aunt.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.844
- How about a playground?
- Wait a moment.

18:22.001 --> 18:25.642
You go to his aunt
and we'll go to the playground.

18:25.805 --> 18:29.309
- Mel, please.
- I fed him, changed his diapers.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.752
- How often?
- lt doesn't matter.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.255
I never hurt him.

18:34.413 --> 18:37.189
Please, you know I work with kids.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.288
Kazik, do you want to go with him
to the playground?

18:50.262 --> 18:52.435
Can I have your autograph?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.835
"SECOND LIFE"

19:10.349 --> 19:11.987
Matylda?

19:16.088 --> 19:17.761
Matylda!

19:24.530 --> 19:28.808
You grew up so much.
You even talk. You used to sit up only.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.909
I missed talking to you.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.574
Now you're a big guy.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.017
And you recognized me.
I wouldn't recognize you.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.851
Everybody will recognize a Santa Claus.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.788
I'm not a Santa Claus.
I'm your dad.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.556
My dad is not a Santa.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.997
I mean he is and he is not.
Get it?

19:54.960 --> 19:57.463
Come on, I'll show you something.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.337
Look.

20:05.304 --> 20:07.511
Now I'm a Santa, right'?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.454
- And now?
- A Santa without a beard.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.214
You're kidding me.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.882
Have you seen such a Santa?
No hat...

20:16.048 --> 20:19.791
no beard, no Santa jacket.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.558
Have you seen a Santa in boxers?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.395
- No.
- Exactly.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.766
- This means I'm your dad.
- What have you got for me?

20:28.828 --> 20:32.173
If I were a Santa, I would have
brought you a gift,

20:32.331 --> 20:35.005
-because Santas always bring...
-gifts.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.705
And I have nothing for you.
Which means I am your dad!

20:39.038 --> 20:42.383
Last year you sent me a gift.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.455
- Isn't it too early for gifts?
- They are still waiting.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.561
Open it.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.168
I've chosen it especially for you.
Do you like it?

20:59.325 --> 21:01.805
- It's expensive.
- Put it on, please.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.968
-It suits you.
Beautiful.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.809
Today, when you meet my parents...

21:11.971 --> 21:14.178
You look very elegant.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.750
No, don't take it off.

21:33.759 --> 21:37.366
Excuse me, is that man...
Never mind.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.710
Hi, Szczepan.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.573
What are you doing here?

21:45.738 --> 21:47.718
What am I doing?

21:47.973 --> 21:50.453
Drinking coffee. And you'?

21:50.609 --> 21:53.385
And you're drinking it here?

21:53.546 --> 21:55.583
All right, then.

21:56.282 --> 21:59.957
- Look...
-ls it a new dress? No...

22:00.119 --> 22:04.124
- I remember it.
- I borrowed it from Majka.

22:04.623 --> 22:07.263
Szczepan, could you
go somewhere else?

22:08.694 --> 22:12.836
Could you? In 15 minutes
I have a date here...

22:13.299 --> 22:16.837
And I won't feel quite comfortable,
when you are here.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.743
It'll be awkward.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.345
You have a date here?

22:22.508 --> 22:25.512
- With who?
- With a man.

22:26.412 --> 22:29.018
I'm just asking you nicely

22:29.181 --> 22:32.162
to drink your coffee
in a different place.

22:32.318 --> 22:35.060
- Is it a problem?
- No, it's not. Not at all.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.134
- I'm asking who is that date with?
- Listen...

22:39.692 --> 22:42.969
pull yourself together. We've been
divorced for 2 years.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.836
- I can meet whoever I want.
- Of course.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.638
- Great.
- Just tell me...

22:48.801 --> 22:51.304
who is that guy'?

22:51.470 --> 22:53.507
Do you want to know?

22:53.672 --> 22:55.515
He's younger than you.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.848
But ifs not an issue here.

22:59.011 --> 23:02.618
He at least tries to understand me.
He's really

23:02.848 --> 23:06.125
cool. I care about him
and wish I had met him earlier.

23:06.285 --> 23:09.232
Does it hurt'? ls it enough?

23:09.388 --> 23:12.130
- What does he look like?
- I don't know.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.602
He lives in Mexico.
I'll see him for the first time today.

23:15.761 --> 23:19.038
Anyway, he'll be the most
beautiful guy for me.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.412
- Oh, It's starting.
- Can I pay for the coffee?

23:22.568 --> 23:26.345
Hang yourself on the cash register.

23:27.039 --> 23:30.350
I didn't want to hurt you.
Jesus Christ.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.551
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.891
I'm waiting for someone.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.928
<i>I want my dad to be happy
on Christmas Eve.</i>

23:42.087 --> 23:45.830
<i>- What does your dad need to be happy?
- He plays lottery</i>

23:45.991 --> 23:48.494
<i>and he the most he hit was four.</i>

24:16.488 --> 24:18.434
High five!

24:19.925 --> 24:23.202
Excuse me, have you seen Matylda?
A small sheep?

24:23.362 --> 24:24.841
No, I haven't.

24:48.787 --> 24:51.461
- Great, isn't it? Crappy crap.
- Crappy crap.

24:51.623 --> 24:55.469
- Is Dad a Superman?
- Yes, he is! -So, come on!

24:56.095 --> 24:58.132
Dad is a Superman!

24:59.832 --> 25:02.039
I love you, my son.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.539
I'm not your son.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.980
Yes, you are.

25:50.382 --> 25:55.092
<i>Do</i> you know what a Superman does?
Have you been <i>to</i> a bookstore lately?

25:55.254 --> 26:00.101
On all the shelves there are books
by one pretty lady.

26:00.492 --> 26:05.305
And 4 years ago your dad
and that lady...

26:05.464 --> 26:08.809
It doesn't matter, anyway.
I understand, that a kid

26:08.967 --> 26:11.880
wants to be proud of his father,
but crappy crap,

26:12.037 --> 26:16.076
you are too young to understand
certain things he accomplished...

26:17.676 --> 26:19.622
What do I have'?

26:20.679 --> 26:22.625
What do I have'?

26:28.654 --> 26:32.761
"Every word here
I wrote thanks to you."

26:46.305 --> 26:47.477
Oh, shit!

26:49.308 --> 26:51.845
- Karol always hits the aim.
- Who?

26:52.010 --> 26:55.287
- Mom's Karol.
- So that's Karol, crappy crap.

26:55.614 --> 27:00.256
Have you ever seen Karol going down
on the balconies from the 4th floor?

27:00.419 --> 27:05.232
And I had to do it many times.
1,2,3... and I'm on the ground.

27:05.390 --> 27:09.167
- Didn't you fall down?
- Never! Do you want to see it?

27:09.328 --> 27:12.207
Do you want to see
what a Superman can do?

27:12.364 --> 27:15.573
Stay here and wait.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.293
I can go higher!

27:35.454 --> 27:38.298
I'll climb an Eiffel Tower for you.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.306
A doggy!

27:57.109 --> 28:01.421
Killer, why are you barking?
Who got on your nerves?

28:02.581 --> 28:05.221
Get inside, or you'll catch a cold.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.091
Come, my baby.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.765
Crappy crap.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.170
What are you staring at?
The chimneys too narrow.

28:20.332 --> 28:23.006
Sing me a Christmas Carol.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.088
Kuba, turn it down!

28:32.244 --> 28:35.714
- Shhh...
- Antos, I'm going to the neighbor's.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.998
You've sung it nicely.
What would you like to get?

28:42.154 --> 28:45.101
- I need money.
- Like everyone.

28:45.257 --> 28:48.761
Precisely, I need 200,000
and two tickets to the USA.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.541
Really?

28:53.131 --> 28:56.340
In the evening it'll be waiting
under the Christmas tree.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.175
Could I borrow some money
from you now?

29:01.740 --> 29:04.744
- I have 30 zlotys.
- It's okay.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.302
Thanks.

29:25.631 --> 29:28.009
Great, kiddo. Give rne five!

29:31.003 --> 29:35.179
Can you let me out? I wouldn't like
to go down the way I came up.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.922
Kazik!

29:42.447 --> 29:44.791
Did I get up? Give me five.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.595
I got 30 zlotys.
Are you hungry?

29:49.321 --> 29:50.959
Let's go.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.642
Kuba, Santa Claus was here.
We'll get the cash.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.576
- What cash?
- All we need.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.847
I borrowed him 30 zlotys,

30:13.011 --> 30:16.288
but he is going to bring 200,000
for the Christmas Eve.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.450
Great deal.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.995
He'll bring 2 tickets to the USA.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.259
Shoot, I could have asked
for the 3rd one for Mom,

30:24.423 --> 30:28.337
-but I didn't want to push my luck.
- Oh, kid, you're crazy.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.439
- Great, isn't it'?
- Sure.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.144
Santa Claus was smoking, not me.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.474
Where are your cigarettes?

30:39.471 --> 30:43.578
Amos has made a deal. He wants
to send me to the Boston Marathon.

30:43.742 --> 30:47.121
- Wha( are you thinking?
- One for Mom.

30:48.413 --> 30:49.949
One for Dad.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.787
What wrong have I done to you'?

30:54.086 --> 30:56.726
That's the way I was born.

31:02.427 --> 31:04.634
I WON'T BE HERE TOMORROW

31:12.471 --> 31:15.077
Who was that boy on the balcony?

31:15.674 --> 31:18.211
A cunning brat.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.688
He said he wanted 200 grand.
Can you imagine?

31:22.547 --> 31:25.721
- He needed help?
- You always talk about helping

31:25.884 --> 31:28.888
or saving people.
You're obsessed or something.

31:29.054 --> 31:32.331
Eat or your strawberries will fall down.

31:33.792 --> 31:38.935
I don't want money. I want to be with
my dad. At least on the Christmas Eve.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.746
Listen...

31:53.912 --> 31:57.382
- Dad loves you very much.
- I know.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.894
He dreams about spending
Christmas with you,

32:01.052 --> 32:03.157
but he can't because...

32:07.592 --> 32:10.596
He can't, because, crappy crap...

32:12.497 --> 32:13.703
because...

32:13.865 --> 32:16.072
He's saving the world.

32:17.836 --> 32:20.908
- Let's call it this way.
-lt's very important.

32:21.506 --> 32:26.012
If Dad didn't have to save the world,
he would visit me, wouldn't he?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.624
Of course, he would visit you.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.760
Oh, my!

32:40.258 --> 32:41.703
Let's go back.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.940
Oh, shit!

33:31.743 --> 33:33.222
Honey?

33:52.364 --> 33:54.105
How is it?

33:54.266 --> 33:55.404
Redo?

34:16.321 --> 34:18.391
Matylda!

34:18.590 --> 34:19.762
Matylda!

34:26.464 --> 34:28.909
Are you crazy? Taking a sheep to a Mall?

34:29.067 --> 34:31.377
It's not my sheep.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.312
Then I'll take it away.

34:34.472 --> 34:36.748
- Leave it.
-ls it yours?

34:36.908 --> 34:41.254
It's mine, I'm sorry. I didn't
recognize it at the first moment.

34:41.413 --> 34:45.918
I thought it was a different one
just passing by. A similar one.

34:46.251 --> 34:49.322
Matylda, where have you been?

34:56.628 --> 34:59.336
I thought Magda
was kidding about the sheep.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.410
Let's take it home.
It might speak with human voice.

35:02.567 --> 35:05.878
Look, it thinks you are...

35:06.037 --> 35:08.984
- Your jacket is made of wool.
- What now?

35:10.709 --> 35:14.521
I don't know. I can look for Magda
and give it back to her.

35:15.780 --> 35:19.956
Okay, have fun with that sheep
and whoever you want.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.292
I'm going back home.
Honey. It's Christmas Eve today.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.902
We're meeting my parents. Bye.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.296
Bye.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.308
So, where is your owner?

35:33.832 --> 35:38.247
Why does a man give
an empty vase to his beloved?

35:38.403 --> 35:41.577
It's broken, so we need to buy it back.

35:41.740 --> 35:45.187
- He could put 200 roses in it.
- Will you help me?

35:45.677 --> 35:50.126
A man should present his beloved
with a ring on the rooftop.

35:50.281 --> 35:53.319
Or make an ice sculpture
like in "A Groundhog Day'.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.591
- Wouldn't you like that?
- I would like...

35:57.989 --> 36:01.869
you to help me. And stop
being such a know-all.

36:02.027 --> 36:05.338
Your dad did his best.
He'll be sad.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.501
Wouldn't you like him to propose?

36:09.701 --> 36:12.545
Look, it's a beautiful vase.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.885
And here... these are toucans, I guess.

36:22.247 --> 36:25.820
If it turns out I was right,
will I get a Wolfhund?

36:25.984 --> 36:29.989
- Are you kidding?
- I'd like to have an Irish Wolfhund.

36:30.155 --> 36:33.159
Do you know how much
such a big dog eats?

36:33.324 --> 36:34.598
No. Period.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.938
So why did Santa climb
all the way up to make a promise?

36:39.097 --> 36:41.941
Your father is working hard
on the Christmas Eve

36:42.100 --> 36:45.912
so that we don't starve, and you
give 30 zlotys to a con artist.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.915
- All we need is a Wolfhound.
- What if he comes?

36:49.074 --> 36:53.284
Sooner a cow shall talk
with its butt. Go in.

36:55.947 --> 36:59.827
Excuse me,
where can I find the manager'?

37:00.118 --> 37:01.961
Straight ahead.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.966
-It's talking with its butt.
- Come on.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.309
I'm sorry.

37:22.474 --> 37:26.286
- Why is the snowman handcuffed?
- How can I know?

37:26.444 --> 37:28.355
See? That's crazy.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.425
- Are you a boss here?
- Yes.

37:40.592 --> 37:44.199
This morning your employee
dressed up as Santa Claus

37:44.362 --> 37:47.206
-climbed up my balcony.
-lt's impossible.

37:47.365 --> 37:52.041
Really? It so happens, that I have
found him in your company offer.

37:52.303 --> 37:55.375
He broke in to my son's room
and he stole 30 zlotys.

37:55.540 --> 38:00.285
We've been on this market for years
and we have a great, professional staff.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.085
So it's absolutely impossible...

38:05.183 --> 38:07.390
Of course, it's possible.

38:15.193 --> 38:18.970
Can you explain to me,
why your employee handcuffed me'?

38:22.033 --> 38:24.343
It was him.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.683
I told you: that's crazy.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.117
It must be your ride.

38:38.616 --> 38:41.563
- There is no ticket.
- Hello.

38:41.719 --> 38:46.327
You won't pay for the parking
without it. And I won't let you out.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.836
Your woman has nearly
destroyed the barrier

38:49.994 --> 38:53.373
and she ran, as if she saw a ghost.
With no ticket.

38:53.531 --> 38:55.670
- Go on.
- During the sales season

38:55.834 --> 38:58.144
I've seen people losing mind.

38:58.303 --> 39:01.682
But this I've seen
for the first time in my life.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.390
Excuse me.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.785
Merry Christmas.

39:13.384 --> 39:16.126
In this case, you can leave
with no ticket.

39:16.287 --> 39:17.630
Merry Christmas.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.541
Matylda, my precious.
Where have you been?

39:29.234 --> 39:31.077
I spotted her buying a sweater.

39:32.737 --> 39:36.412
Don't you know, that little sheep
shouldn't do shopping alone?

39:40.178 --> 39:42.624
Thanks. How did you catch her'?

39:42.780 --> 39:45.260
- I called her.
- And she came up to you?

39:45.416 --> 39:48.829
I promised her I would
take you both for ice-cream.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.160
What do you want'?

39:54.259 --> 39:56.330
I thought that we could...

39:56.794 --> 39:59.035
You have a girlfriend,

40:00.465 --> 40:02.103
so go to her.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.870
And leave me alone... piss off,

40:06.037 --> 40:09.575
not to use worse words... Got it?

40:35.533 --> 40:37.535
Is it so funny?

40:37.702 --> 40:39.682
I have enough of my problems.

40:39.837 --> 40:41.214
Thank you.

41:07.632 --> 41:12.513
I'm telling you, it is not a big sheep,
but a little lamb...

41:12.971 --> 41:17.317
It's nearby. She won't make anything
dirty. I'll keep her on my lap.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.020
I've already called all the taxi...

41:21.179 --> 41:22.385
companies.

41:24.115 --> 41:29.064
I am sorry too. I'm never going to use
your services again. Merry Christmas.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.966
You don't have to believe me.

41:37.128 --> 41:40.109
That was the most beautiful
weekend in my life.

41:56.881 --> 41:59.987
You better tell me
how you proposed to Monika.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.596
What?

42:01.753 --> 42:05.758
We thought that
as we live together anyway...

42:05.923 --> 42:08.369
It's nice.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.676
Magda, I love you.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.573
I love you.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.465
Tell me one word,
and I will leave Monika.

42:45.096 --> 42:48.475
And if I won'! say anything?
What happens then?

42:48.866 --> 42:53.178
You'll marry her? And at the wedding,
little girls will throw rose petals,

42:53.337 --> 42:57.877
and the organist will sing the song
that you wrote for me out of love?

42:59.210 --> 43:03.283
Get a grip, Redo.
It's a piece of advice for the future.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.166
Will you give me a ride?

43:46.624 --> 43:48.797
It'll be good here.

43:53.197 --> 43:57.976
I also have a boyfriend. He's handsome,
intelligent and he runs a business,

43:58.136 --> 44:00.878
"Santa For Hire" and he's successful.

44:02.340 --> 44:05.048
And don't think that he's gay.

44:05.610 --> 44:08.250
Here's my prince. Bye!

44:40.778 --> 44:43.054
She got discharged.

44:43.881 --> 44:45.292
This morning.

44:46.384 --> 44:48.455
She got discharged.

44:55.092 --> 44:56.935
That's Karol!

45:07.004 --> 45:10.315
- How was it today?
- I went sledging.

45:10.474 --> 45:13.512
- And what else?
- I ate waffles.

45:20.451 --> 45:24.558
The waffles were with whipped
cream and strawberries.

45:26.290 --> 45:30.432
And with little bubbles.

45:30.761 --> 45:32.365
They were black.

46:31.122 --> 46:34.262
Oh, my! I'm sorry.

46:34.425 --> 46:37.099
I'm dropping everything today.

46:37.828 --> 46:39.774
It's nothing.

46:41.265 --> 46:43.745
- Will you open the wine?
- Now?

46:43.901 --> 46:46.472
Don't you feel like wine?

46:46.637 --> 46:49.379
We always wait until the first star...

46:49.540 --> 46:52.419
Red wine should breathe a little bit.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.453
You're right.

46:58.849 --> 47:00.624
It's exquisite.

47:00.785 --> 47:02.458
Brunello di Montalcino.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.497
It's absolutely unique.

47:04.655 --> 47:08.432
Its secret is a careful choice
of the plants and a proper nurturing.

47:08.592 --> 47:11.596
The rest is done
by the water and the sun.

47:12.963 --> 47:14.101
Delicious.

47:14.265 --> 47:16.142
I love you.

47:16.300 --> 47:18.576
I'm so glad we're going
to the mountains.

47:18.736 --> 47:21.216
Though you would prefer the seaside.

47:22.006 --> 47:24.145
I would prefer you...

47:31.549 --> 47:34.291
Well, this wine is unique.

47:34.452 --> 47:37.558
Next year you both
can go to the seaside.

47:38.389 --> 47:40.630
Don't say that.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.194
Don't worry.

47:44.428 --> 47:48.103
I might be with you, too.
I'll always be with you.

48:10.621 --> 48:11.929
Tosia?

48:12.623 --> 48:14.068
Tosia.

48:14.759 --> 48:18.297
- My child...
- Mom, please.

48:18.796 --> 48:22.710
- Let's change the subject.
-l'm begging you, Morn.

48:23.300 --> 48:26.406
That surgery gives me minimal chance.

48:27.838 --> 48:31.149
When I escaped the orphanage,
I also had minimal chance.

48:31.275 --> 48:35.519
I thought that if I raised that money...

48:35.679 --> 48:39.650
-you'd see how much I care.
-l'm very proud of you, honey.

48:39.817 --> 48:42.730
But I think that this subject is closed.

48:48.259 --> 48:51.263
Will you sing "Silent Night" for me'?

48:51.529 --> 48:54.874
Especially for me during
the Christmas Eve dinner?

48:55.266 --> 48:57.906
You don't sing Christmas Carols
at the wake.

49:10.114 --> 49:13.493
We'll get back to the question
if carp is good for sushi.

49:13.651 --> 49:17.622
Your guest today is Karina Lisiecka,
the author of a bestseller:

49:17.788 --> 49:19.233
"The Second Life".

49:19.390 --> 49:25.136
<i>My heroine marries a very nice man.
He's kind and protective.</i>

49:25.296 --> 49:30.041
He loves her, never cheats on her,
brings a Christmas tree and suddenly...

49:31.735 --> 49:36.411
<i>One morning you realize
that you have no dreams, no passions,</i>

49:36.574 --> 49:38.417
you just have no life.

49:38.576 --> 49:42.683
<i>There is</i> a <i>relationship,
but the people are gone,</i>

49:42.847 --> 49:46.454
<i>they have nothing to offer
to one another.</i>

49:46.784 --> 49:50.630
Apart from a set of elegant glasses
under a Christmas Tree.

49:52.456 --> 49:55.369
A husband who buys a vase...

49:55.526 --> 49:59.372
I mean glasses... is a by-plot.

49:59.530 --> 50:01.806
<i>The main one is a story</i>

50:01.966 --> 50:05.470
of great love. Two halves
find each other in the world.

50:05.636 --> 50:09.083
<i>- And they get back to life.
- Wouldn't you like</i>

50:09.240 --> 50:13.211
-to meet love online?
- I'm not a character of this novel.

50:13.377 --> 50:15.288
And if you were?

50:21.051 --> 50:22.997
<i>I would like to.</i>

50:24.822 --> 50:27.666
Alas! So there's a chance for a sequel,

50:27.825 --> 50:32.171
but this time it will be
a classic horror.

50:32.663 --> 50:36.110
Love wins all. That's how it is in life.
Like in "Bridget Jones"

50:36.267 --> 50:39.680
-or in "Pretty Woman"
- You're talking about life or movies?

50:39.837 --> 50:42.545
These movies are inspired by life.

50:43.307 --> 50:44.786
Hit the brakes!

51:00.457 --> 51:02.459
- Mel?
- Doris!

51:04.261 --> 51:05.968
It's so good to see you.

51:07.264 --> 51:11.337
- Hi, have you checked the presents?
- No, I haven't.

51:11.502 --> 51:15.348
- The vase is a pathetic present.
- As every year.

51:15.506 --> 51:19.386
Remember the movie I didn't let you
watch? If you say a word to Doris,

51:19.543 --> 51:22.547
I'll do to you what the good guy
did to the bad guy.

51:22.713 --> 51:26.388
Have you seen Harry giving
Sally a vase?

51:26.550 --> 51:28.587
<i>- What</i> Harry?
<i>- From "When Harry met Sally".</i>

51:28.752 --> 51:32.427
Doris would like to get
an engagement ring.

51:32.590 --> 51:37.005
At the top of the Empire State Building
like in the "Sleepless in Seattle".

51:37.161 --> 51:41.109
- It's quite far away from here.
-lt's in New York.

51:41.599 --> 51:45.012
I work in graphics now.
These posters are all over the city.

51:45.169 --> 51:49.845
- Have you read it?
- No, but I have touched the subject.

51:50.007 --> 51:52.749
<i>I 'm starting my sledge
with</i> a <i>turbocharger.</i>

51:52.910 --> 51:55.754
You should hurry,
we almost died today.

51:55.913 --> 51:59.759
<i>And every woman wants to wear
a wedding gown once before she dies.</i>

51:59.917 --> 52:05.299
- A regular wedding gown: laces, a veil.
- Why you almost died?

52:05.456 --> 52:08.869
- Could you lend me some money?
- You haven't changed a bit.

52:09.026 --> 52:10.266
I'll give it back.

52:10.427 --> 52:14.603
We got into such a skid
that it was a close shave

52:14.765 --> 52:18.008
-and we would end up like in "Misery".
- In what?

52:18.168 --> 52:20.808
I have just changed.

52:21.872 --> 52:24.409
- Merry Christmas.
- All the best.

52:25.075 --> 52:28.249
You didn't let me watch it.
I have to go.

52:39.156 --> 52:41.067
It fell down.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.167
Here you go.
Have a good day.

52:46.630 --> 52:49.668
Excuse me, we are looking for a vase.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.471
It's...

52:52.336 --> 52:55.681
- We have many vases here.
- Exactly.

52:55.839 --> 52:58.547
I'll try and explain it.

52:58.709 --> 53:03.624
I don't want just a vase
but a particular vase.

53:04.114 --> 53:06.993
- That's what we need.
- Exactly.

53:08.819 --> 53:10.560
- Burgund.
- Excuse me?

53:10.721 --> 53:12.826
This model is called Burgund.

53:12.990 --> 53:15.470
You're in luck.

53:16.093 --> 53:19.540
- How do you know it's this one?
- Don't you remember how we

53:19.697 --> 53:23.304
-put it together?
- I've worked with china for 20 years

53:23.467 --> 53:25.708
and I have a lot of experience.

53:26.303 --> 53:28.146
Just a moment.

53:28.672 --> 53:30.379
And now?

53:32.042 --> 53:34.784
It looks similar but...

53:34.945 --> 53:37.516
I'm not sure.
I don't remember.

53:37.681 --> 53:40.059
How much is that?

53:40.984 --> 53:44.056
-36,50.
- Oh, no. It's not that one.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.462
-It's too cheap.
- Intention is

53:46.623 --> 53:49.297
-what counts.
- I can sell ii for more.

53:50.127 --> 53:54.303
No, I see now
it's not that one for sure.

53:54.465 --> 53:57.469
So you're an expert
and I'm not.

53:58.535 --> 54:00.708
<i>So, here you gu.</i>

54:05.943 --> 54:09.117
- And now?
- Look, it's identical.

54:09.279 --> 54:11.520
- I have told you.
- Have you?

54:12.449 --> 54:14.326
Okay, <i>l'll</i> take it.

54:14.651 --> 54:17.632
And I'll pay for the broken one too.

54:18.222 --> 54:21.135
We'll take 2 just in case.

54:21.291 --> 54:24.363
I'll check if we have them.

54:30.367 --> 54:33.371
You know, Mom,
that Dad saves the world?

54:33.537 --> 54:36.245
- He told you so'?
- A man on the radio said so.

54:36.406 --> 54:40.081
Well, he doesn't know your dad.
Dad is a bastard...

54:40.244 --> 54:42.918
- Don't say that.
- Should I lie?

54:43.080 --> 54:45.583
He met him.
Let him have his own opinion.

54:45.749 --> 54:47.956
When did I meet him'?

54:48.819 --> 54:51.163
You spent half a day with him.

54:51.388 --> 54:54.665
- When?
- Today. You said you recognized him.

54:55.592 --> 54:58.198
- Hello, my darlings.
- Hello.

54:59.329 --> 55:01.275
- Come in.
- Let's go.

55:07.337 --> 55:09.510
How do you like the vase?

55:09.673 --> 55:11.482
A lot.

55:12.342 --> 55:14.219
Look.

55:14.378 --> 55:17.188
These are presents
for a beloved one.

55:17.347 --> 55:19.224
Which one do you like?

55:20.884 --> 55:22.488
None. Let's go.

55:22.653 --> 55:25.224
Tell me.
I might buy one for Wiktoria.

55:26.790 --> 55:28.497
Come.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.834
- You can't propose with a vase.
- Yes, but...

55:32.996 --> 55:35.442
I don't want to propose.

55:35.599 --> 55:38.637
Well, I do, but...
Never mind.

55:39.403 --> 55:41.747
-I've bought a ring already.
- When?

55:41.905 --> 55:44.818
- A year ago.
- So what are you waiting for?

55:44.975 --> 55:49.685
For a special moment. Should I
propose at the stadium during the finals,

55:49.847 --> 55:53.727
-or while parachuting?
- I rented a tower.

55:56.987 --> 55:58.762
That's the way you do it.

55:58.922 --> 56:02.665
The more you give in love
the more there is left for you.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.934
So I would like to give you everything:

56:09.099 --> 56:11.909
my life, my dreams,

56:12.636 --> 56:17.483
joy of looking at the stars and dreams
that nothing will ever part us.

56:19.209 --> 56:21.450
Will you marry me?

56:30.120 --> 56:33.124
The waitresses enter
with the baskets full of rose petals

56:33.290 --> 56:36.032
-and they shower Kasia.
- Rose petals?

56:36.193 --> 56:40.005
- Haven't you spoken to Kostek?
- Women love it.

56:40.163 --> 56:42.040
Sure, but Doris?

56:45.068 --> 56:47.548
So perhaps a stadium would be better.

56:52.943 --> 56:54.684
It's beautiful.

56:54.845 --> 56:58.054
- How much is it?
-2300 zlotys.

57:00.050 --> 57:03.793
I had something more expensive on mind,
but it is beautiful indeed.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.166
I'll think about it.

57:07.324 --> 57:11.704
Wiktoria is a lucky girl,
but you'll have to save up some money.

57:11.862 --> 57:14.604
I'll manage. Thank you.

57:16.633 --> 57:21.082
It's not just a vase,
but high quality Spanish porcelain.

57:21.238 --> 57:23.912
Hand made by the masters
of Almassera,

57:24.074 --> 57:27.715
hand-painted with toucans,
which Doris loves. It cost a fortune.

57:27.878 --> 57:32.418
I have to go and buy mistletoe
hand-gathered by local masters.

57:33.417 --> 57:35.590
- Have a good one.
- All the best.

57:35.752 --> 57:38.164
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

57:52.636 --> 57:55.583
Finally.

57:56.206 --> 57:59.210
The garage door was stuck
when I drove in.

57:59.376 --> 58:03.882
- I don't know. I parked outside.
- Remind me, I'll report it.

58:04.848 --> 58:08.125
- You remembered.
- Cheesecake and poppy-seed cake.

58:08.285 --> 58:09.628
You're wonderful.

58:11.655 --> 58:13.328
I've promised.

58:15.826 --> 58:20.366
He's a jerk, who has no heart.
On the top of that has a girlfriend.

58:20.530 --> 58:22.635
- But you love him.
- So what?

58:22.799 --> 58:26.474
No, nothing. It's ready.
It should get you there.

58:26.636 --> 58:29.708
- Ostroleka is not the end of the world.
- Isn't it?

58:30.807 --> 58:32.718
It's a pity.

58:34.211 --> 58:36.054
Smile.

58:36.213 --> 58:38.284
Come back soon.

58:39.716 --> 58:40.786
Thanks.

58:40.951 --> 58:43.830
Go and bring back jars with preserves.

58:43.987 --> 58:47.662
- You're a big preserve. Merry Christmas.
- To you too.

58:49.593 --> 58:51.300
GO, go:

58:59.669 --> 59:03.310
Delicious! I'll tell my parents
that you baked it yourself.

59:03.473 --> 59:05.885
- How about some wine'?
-l'm driving.

59:06.043 --> 59:08.683
Are you going somewhere?

59:09.513 --> 59:12.722
You're right. You'll drive
my parents home.

59:17.954 --> 59:19.228
Monika.

59:21.324 --> 59:23.804
- Wait, I'll cut it up.
- What?

59:23.960 --> 59:28.136
No. Check on the borscht.
My parents will be here soon.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:37.810
There is an occasion drink a shot
so I wanted to take it.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.346
Robert, that London studio,

01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:43.917
you don't even realize
who recorded there.

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:48.084
Will April be okay for you?
Where is the...

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.525
You know, I've already arranged...

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.393
I'm sorry, but I can't record in London.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.796
What is wrong with London'?

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:07.772
- I came to say...
- Dad...

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.873
Robert will neither record
in London...

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:13.571
nor he will spend
Christmas Eve with us.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:15.842
He won't spend anything with us.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.676
I don't understand.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.883
He decided to take up sheep breeding.

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.119
Sheep?

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:31.596
What sheep? I've already
arranged for that studio.

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:37.165
Recently I've seen somewhere
a wedding American Style.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.364
- Mom.
- In the open air.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:43.341
And there on grass among the guests...
little sheep walked around.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.343
We have parted.

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:47.709
I'm sorry.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.646
Holy shit.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.110
How will I call it off now?

01:01:57.414 --> 01:01:59.052
You're an asshole!

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.218
Merry Christmas.

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.836
Great. I'll come as soon as I can.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:55.381
Maybe I'll bring your grandson...
Bye, mom.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.481
How much is that?

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:01.378
- Twenty.
- How much?

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:05.586
- I'll add a wafer as a bonus.
- I just want that head.

01:03:05.749 --> 01:03:08.059
I'll give you a fiver.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.327
Seven zloty.

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:15.998
I can give you the head for free.

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:18.298
So that's the deal.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.601
I can add it to the wafer.

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:24.541
- And how much is a wafer?
- Twenty.

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:36.121
Here you go.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.054
Thanks.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:44.557
Thanks.

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.794
Hello, my darlings.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:53.304
How did you spend the last hours
before the birth of Jesus?

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:57.377
Great. Kostek found a present
for his sweetheart.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:04:00.071
I hope mine will be your dream present.

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:02.546
And romantic too.

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:06.119
Knowing your dad
it will be something practical.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.882
You said intention is all that matters.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.753
I wanted it to be a real surprise.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:16.489
- Don't worry. It's really great.
- You don't know what it is.

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:19.429
That's right. How could I know.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:24.002
- Why are you standing here like that?
- How?

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.798
- Dad, can you help me?
- With what?

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:31.179
- A letter to Wiktoria.
- Write it yourself.

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:36.647
I know what to write, but you
know how to do it in a romantic way.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:37.807
Jesus.

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.454
How do you call her?

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.716
-"My dearest sweetheart".
- Let's write it down then.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.224
My dearest sweetheart.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:51.492
I would like to give you today and
every day, until the end of the world...

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.656
Great.

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:58.169
So just sit here and write
and I will be back in a moment.

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:00.865
But where are you going? Hey!

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:19.454
My dearest sweetheart. I would like
to give you my love, my heart,

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:23.587
sorrows, moments of reverie,
and dreams about us living together.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:27.064
The more love you give
the more there's left for you.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:30.500
I hope you're as happy as I am.
I'like to get old with you.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.163
I love you more than my life.
Blah blah blah.

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:36.776
- You've written that?
- Sure. I've consulted Misiek.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.539
He said that girls love such lines.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:43.582
It's good. I'll rewrite it nicely.
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:52.459
Karina!

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.658
What is it?

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:03.862
Are you a cabby now?
I didn't order a cab.

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:06.934
Listen.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.544
Damn.

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:14.675
It was me.

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:17.079
I can see that.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:20.117
You again. I'm not in the mood.

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:22.756
You don't understand. It was me.

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:27.452
- I got a date, and met you.
- And I met you! Leave rne alone!

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.996
Sometimes people happen
to bump into each other!

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.135
You still don't understand!
I was your date!

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.002
What?
What are you talking about?

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:47.178
I was surprised myself.
Listen!

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.377
- Give it back.
- No.

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:52.918
- Give me my hat back.
- I am Pedro 67.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.521
- I don't believe you.
- You'd better do.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.059
I live on a Mazunle beach in Mexico.
I go fishing.

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:04.096
My wife died <i>,</i> so I came to Warsaw

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:08.561
-to meet you.
- I don't believe this!

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.465
Did you have fun?

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:17.041
- Fricking cabby!
- I didn't know it was you.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.181
Stop it! I didn't know it was you!

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:24.409
- Why did you write to me?!
- I don'! know! I just did it!

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:29.284
- Maybe we're meant for each other'?
- My ass we are!

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:30.924
Stop that!

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.323
- I want my hat, please!
- Don't you get it?

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:37.590
-My hat!
-Don't you get it?!

01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:39.495
Maybe ifs a sign?!

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:42.500
Maybe we're in love again?!

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:48.473
Think about it! Stop breaking that!
Maybe we got a second chance?

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:52.511
- Leave the lady alone!
- Back off!

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:56.207
- Stop! Stop abusing me!
- Calm down!

01:07:56.372 --> 01:08:00.081
Stop stalking me!

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:02.849
Maybe we should give it a try!

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:05.185
I didn't know it was you!

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:10.888
I don't believe a single word you say!

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.426
You're nuts.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:20.301
You're hopeless, and self-centered!
You've got shit between your ears!

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:23.808
And this hat you got from me,
Kathrine 29!

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.844
Get away from my car!

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.540
You may shove it up your ass!

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:32.214
Screw you!

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:41.261
I may be your witness.

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:44.158
Leave me alone.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:19.733
- Hello, in-law.
- Don't call me that. Merry Christmas.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:22.768
I didn't want to upset you...

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:24.961
...but Dad got himself...

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:27.368
I hoped he'd change his mind,

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:30.602
but he's going to bring her
to Christmas Eve dinner.

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:32.246
My child,

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.548
your father is a cheat!

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:38.082
And a moron!

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:42.018
Yes, but you also wanted to bring...

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.282
No, dear.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.926
I didn't want anything.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:47.652
Nice shoes.

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:51.996
I've always wanted to get them.
Thanks.

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:55.159
We'll buy you a pair then.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:59.500
These ones are for her.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.206
She's a jogger.
So we've been told.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:07.371
She brags she does 10 kilometers
in 53 minutes.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:11.144
Dad believes her.
He's a fool for that snot.

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:14.948
A snot? Do you know her?
So why are you saying that?

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.888
Maybe she's a fine
and intelligent lady.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.619
Mature.

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:24.997
Doesn't matter.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.833
Not 53...

01:10:33.196 --> 01:10:35.142
...but 52.

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:38.745
She does 10 kilometers...
in 52 minutes.

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:46.009
- How old did Dad say she was?
-29.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:51.391
- Is that what he said?
-l'm so sorry...

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.705
Excuse me!

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:18.643
What?

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.056
<i>- I... I...
- You what?</i>

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:26.189
I read it twice.

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:30.229
It made me believe
I can change my life.

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:32.229
You know what?

01:11:33.156 --> 01:11:35.261
You can change shit.

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.768
You can change your hairstyle.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:40.967
But you wrote it here.

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:44.706
Seems so.

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:50.545
So you don't believe life
can be changed? Like in your novel...

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:52.583
Don't you?

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.089
Do I?

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.653
Excuse me.
I've got to run.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.800
Merry Christmas!

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:23.343
"SECOND LIFE"
KARINA LISIECKA

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:00.383
Good evening.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.389
Why are you walking alone?

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.594
It's not safe around here.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:09.661
Do your parents know?

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:24.872
Screw it!

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.557
Excuse me!

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.139
Merry Christmas.

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.611
Could you give me a push?

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:08.952
I know she won't change her mind.
Neither will you.

01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:13.350
I don't want to be away from you
this Christmas Eve.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.163
Do what it takes.

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.597
You may scream,

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.941
swear,
I don't know...

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:30.168
...demolish the house,
throw things around.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:34.680
I just don't want us to be apart
this Christmas Eve.

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.241
Fuc...

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:39.314
I'm sorry.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:44.021
I said I was sorry.
I shouldn't have said that!

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:03.606
I'm looking for Magda,
a girl with a sheep.

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:05.074
She's not here.

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:08.647
- Have you heard from Mel?
- He doesn't pick up the phone.

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:11.808
Merry Christmas.
Can I help you?

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:16.614
- Do I look like I need help?
- Yes, actually you do.

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.620
Really?

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:21.255
- What's up'?
- Nothing.

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:25.160
- How long have you been together'?
- Why do you want to know?

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.926
I'm talking to him.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.264
<i>7</i> years.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.535
- You're lying.
- No.

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.470
- Who is it'?
-7 years?

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:36.807
Does it surprise you'?

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.414
I'm such a moron!

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:46.714
SANTAS FOR HIRE

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:06.771
You are together!

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:09.533
Shall I spell it for you?

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:12.406
No, that's great!
You're together!

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:16.346
- Shall I run him over?
- Definitely.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:19.481
Swell! You're a couple, guys!

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:37.802
What happened with the boy'?
Did a vile dragon snatch him?

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.373
-It was a dog.
- A dog snatched a boy?

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:45.876
A dog ripped his pants.
And the boy has a problem.

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:48.174
He's still 200 grand short.

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:53.047
Where does he get those stories from?
I left him with Mel just for a few hours.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.018
He's a great storyteller.

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:56.780
Karol!

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.184
Are you ill'?

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:03.429
- Yes, I am.
- Are you going to die?

01:17:03.586 --> 01:17:06.999
It's a pity.
You don't look sad though.

01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:10.363
- How arrogant! After all that...
- Maybe we should...?

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:14.099
- Are you justifying him?
- No, but he's the father after all.

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:18.473
Is that a good enough reason
to ruin Malgorzata's Christmas Eve?

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:25.341
It's someone to see Karol.

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:33.584
Fear not!

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:35.456
I wanted to...

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:42.267
We're even. No need to apologize.
Get lost. Betty doesn't want to see you.

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:45.166
Please... Give it to Kazik.

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:48.967
What shall I tell him?
That his father...

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:52.544
Don't tell him it's from his father.

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:55.914
Tell him it's from Santa Claus.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.217
Kazik knows you're his father.

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:01.116
No, he doesn't.

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:03.285
Yes, he does.

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:06.756
I told him.

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.263
Karol!

01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:18.028
Let rne have the Christmas Eve dinner.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:21.631
Stay cool! Thanks!

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.800
- You're leaving.
- As you can see.

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:31.269
- To Mexico?
- Yes, I never changed my plans.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:34.539
To the Mazunte beach.
That's the boat, right?

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:38.507
Yes. I bought it on the internet
2 months ago.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:42.548
- Not bad. So it's true.
- What's true?

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:46.557
- That you sold your apartment.
- You knew that.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:50.089
And that robe. It's red.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:55.126
- You have a problem with that?
- No, I love red. My ex hated it.

01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:00.665
Your ex isn't here.

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.001
I know.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:07.005
He's probably sitting somewhere
upset that nothings the old way.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:10.082
Every time he wanted
to change our life,

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:14.449
-he tried to keep things the old way.
- I never liked your ex.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.021
A real bore.

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:21.387
- No sense of humor.
- My wife was a bore too.

01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:24.827
She had sex with Santa Claus.

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:27.667
I still loved her.

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:33.932
She's dead.

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.334
Gone.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.411
Why did you do that?

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.074
Allow me!

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.914
Does it hurt? Loosen it up!

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:58.395
If she was alive,
I wouldn't have met you.

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:07.140
Let us stay, in case Santa comes.

01:21:07.296 --> 01:21:10.539
You've seen what kind of Santa it is.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:14.977
Let him stay alone then.
I'm too tired to argue.

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:26.055
Get dressed.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:30.155
Shall I help you get up?

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:32.890
I'm tired of this.

01:21:34.423 --> 01:21:38.769
<i>Get dressed in no</i> time...

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:41.635
Fund's in the fridge.
Amos, come.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.971
If you change your mind...

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:47.811
- Mom.
- Yes?

01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:53.085
- Get Antos that Wolfhund.
- We have no money.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.745
Get him one, when you do.

01:22:04.987 --> 01:22:06.557
Don't worry.

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:08.791
Why should I'?

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:10.800
I'm just saying.

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:15.165
Off you go, kid.

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:33.120
All the best to you.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.455
Merry Christmas, Son.

01:22:38.554 --> 01:22:43.264
Let all your dreams come true.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:55.211
And Mel - I wish you not to screw it up,
as you usually do.

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:16.429
Happy Birthday!

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:19.266
- To whom?
- To Kazik!!!

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:26.908
Awesome racing sledge.

01:23:46.555 --> 01:23:48.762
And whose idea was it?

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.693
Szczepan is here.

01:24:34.336 --> 01:24:38.307
- This is for Kuba's surgery in America.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:42.285
And this is for the Wolfhund.

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:46.790
It'll take a while.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.896
This is for you too, Kazik.

01:24:57.526 --> 01:25:00.006
Look what else you got.

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:03.632
A huge teddy, a toy car...

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.890
Mom...

01:26:00.055 --> 01:26:03.628
If Kuba dies,

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:08.104
could we afford a Wolfhund then?

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:19.181
May I?

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.401
Merry Christmas.

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:27.881
Pull over!

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:46.171
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:49.470
Quiet. Don't cry.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:13.421
Let's see what you've got for me.

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:21.133
What a beautiful vase!
I'd never guess.

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:23.465
Spanish porcelain.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:25.509
Hand-painted...

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:28.174
chickens.

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:33.012
Such an expensive gift,
and all I got you is a ball.

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:34.846
You're so sweet.

01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:37.422
There's a letter...

01:28:52.594 --> 01:28:55.803
- What?
- I love you too.

01:28:58.099 --> 01:28:59.407
Excuse me.

01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:02.014
Come here, kid.

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:06.644
- What's that vase about?
-lt's hopeless.

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:09.414
- Where's mine?
- I knew it'd work.

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:11.455
- What?
- The letter.

01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:13.957
Do you want to get smacked'?

01:29:17.252 --> 01:29:19.095
We aren't going back.

01:29:19.254 --> 01:29:21.996
I won't fall asleep
without the Superman.

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:24.330
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:28.834
- The boy! Pull over! Stop!
- What boy?

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:32.137
Kazik! Get back here!

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:36.039
<i>Skim!</i>

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:40.612
- Dad! Dad's in there!
- What are you doing?

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:44.382
- Dad's in there!
- Get back in the car now!

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:57.766
Kuba, my God.

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.917
Are you okay, Kuba?

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:23.995
Dad!

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.947
Get a cab.

01:30:49.344 --> 01:30:53.451
- You were damn lucky.
-lt is my dad. He's a Superman.

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:55.492
Seems so.

01:31:35.924 --> 01:31:37.665
I love you.

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:24.209
What are you doing?

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:27.216
I've got something else for you.

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:32.180
I got that round thing...

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:38.257
- Did you touch anything here, Kostek?
- To the side.

01:32:40.155 --> 01:32:44.626
There's such a moment
in a man's life,

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:46.773
and a woman's too,

01:32:47.429 --> 01:32:50.000
but usually in a man's one...

01:32:50.165 --> 01:32:51.769
Anyways...

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:56.143
I don't know if you'll like it,
if it's in your taste...

01:32:57.806 --> 01:33:00.309
I can't believe this.

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.584
Me neither.

01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:06.385
It's just like the one
I fell in love with.

01:33:06.548 --> 01:33:09.927
It means you understand each other
without words.

01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:12.395
You're made for each other.

01:33:12.554 --> 01:33:15.899
Will you say yes, Doris?

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:19.664
- Or else I'll perform a ritual...
- Yes.

01:33:19.828 --> 01:33:23.776
- Killing on one...
- Kneel and spit it out at last.

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:29.039
Will you marry me'?

01:33:31.039 --> 01:33:32.313
Yes!

01:33:52.527 --> 01:33:54.529
- My daughter.
- Open it.

01:33:55.964 --> 01:33:56.999
Thank you!

01:33:58.166 --> 01:33:59.702
A sailor's cape.

01:33:59.868 --> 01:34:02.974
You said sailing was awesome,
so we thought...

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:05.880
...we'd gel you this beauty.

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:08.112
Baby?

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:11.020
How could you, Justyna?

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:14.592
What have I done'?

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:19.054
What's wrong, girl?

01:34:22.724 --> 01:34:24.101
Tell us!

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:04.533
<i>Luck up.</i>

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:07.646
Can you see it?

01:35:08.336 --> 01:35:11.545
The small one's for you.

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:33.933
It was supposed to be bigger,
but bigger ones were sold out.

01:35:34.262 --> 01:35:36.435
Do you like it?

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:42.380
What about 'till death do us part?'

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:45.575
And in a toffee cream.

01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:24.785
Stop, Dad. Once again.

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.348
Dad!

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.522
Hi, Son.

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:05.153
- In a children hospital in Bielany.
- We'll stop off to say goodbye.

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:08.600
I got it, bye.

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:25.013
I'll need to change your name
in my phone.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:28.746
- What do you have there now?
- Dork.

01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:41.967
Did Santa screw you too?

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:49.203
What's wrong with your brother'?

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:51.469
It's a long story.

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:10.896
Thank you very much.

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:13.259
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

01:38:13.421 --> 01:38:17.267
We lost all hope. And then
all these good things happened to us.

01:38:17.425 --> 01:38:19.632
And now the money from Tosia.

01:38:20.428 --> 01:38:22.635
I would've forgotten.

01:38:23.531 --> 01:38:28.002
I got back there that night
to return the 30 zlotys.

01:38:28.169 --> 01:38:29.580
Thank you.

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:34.049
I still have no idea how come
you ended up on that balcony.

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:36.048
A miracle.

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:39.785
A Christmas Eve miracle.

01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:53.363
Good.

01:38:56.831 --> 01:38:58.936
I love you!
