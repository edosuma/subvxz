underground escort service.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.919
I recruit from a rec room

01:27.087 --> 01:28.504
on the third floor of my dorm

01:28.671 --> 01:30.547
where I pimp the kids
from my boarding school.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.383
In fact, I have two
of my boys right here.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.427
And they are just one table away

01:35.595 --> 01:37.429
from one of my tricks.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.557
Now I know you'Ve probably
got about 20 questions

01:40.725 --> 01:42.976
right on the tip of your tongue.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.606
Well, if you must know,

01:47.774 --> 01:50.234
then let us begin.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.424
Sam!

02:15.426 --> 02:17.136
Over here.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.557
Sam, you have been kicked out

02:21.724 --> 02:23.725
of a couple of Very prominent

02:23.893 --> 02:25.686
boarding schools in this country.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.856
- Okay, yes, but about that...
- Stop.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.652
I read your transcripts.
You'Ve got a 3.87

02:33.820 --> 02:35.988
three years and running.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.699
You've got some kick-ass
writing samples to boot.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.119
You also clearly have
a problem with authority.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.746
And it just
makes my mind wonder,

02:44.914 --> 02:48.709
"What exactly
am I in for here, Sam?"

02:48.877 --> 02:50.752
Okay, noted.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.380
But here is the thing:

02:53.548 --> 02:57.384
I wasn't exactly kicked out
of all my schools per se.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.597
I am somebody that you would
consider a victim of, um...

03:01.764 --> 03:04.016
- Circumstances?
- Circumstances, yes.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.767
And you know what?
Most people don't believe it,

03:05.935 --> 03:07.728
but...

03:07.896 --> 03:10.272
I've journaled about it, man.
You can read it if you want.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.816
Just give me the Cliff Notes.

- Mom.
- Sam?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.046
That's tough.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.839
Nah, you know, it's just kinda...

04:21.052 --> 04:23.595
par for the course
when your mom's an ex-Playmate.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.724
Well put.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.393
I know your mom.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.687
Hmm?
Really?

04:31.854 --> 04:34.314
You know, Sam,
she's a nice lady.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.276
Batshit crazy,
but she's a good chick.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.528
So is that you?

04:40.863 --> 04:43.031
That, my friend,
was the Eliminator tour.

04:43.199 --> 04:47.619
Eight years of more pussy
than any one man could ever handle...

04:49.247 --> 04:51.999
which, by the way,
is why you should wear a rubber.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.252
Or you'll find yourself
knocking up the wrong groupie

04:55.420 --> 04:58.547
and trading in your dream

04:58.715 --> 05:00.882
of a harmonica solo
with Billy Gibbons

05:01.050 --> 05:04.803
to become the headmaster
of a private academy.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.808
But...

05:10.810 --> 05:12.811
I love my daughter.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.439
She taught me
how to respect women.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.943
Or some shit like that.
You ready for the $5 tour?

05:26.617 --> 05:29.017
This is our history department.
Ian, get off that cell phone.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.871
Oh good.
'Cause I'm a history nut.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.874
I'm a really big fan
of the French Revolution,

05:34.042 --> 05:35.625
especially Napoleon.
I love Napoleons.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.836
They're very tasty.
Have you ever had one?

05:38.838 --> 05:41.340
So you're a writer and a dick?

05:41.507 --> 05:43.508
I'd be careful of your roomie here.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.761
I hear he's a bit of a strange bird,

05:45.928 --> 05:47.763
likes to whip out the fifi bag

05:47.930 --> 05:49.681
when the lights go down.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.558
What is a fifi bag?

05:51.726 --> 05:53.268
Bukowski term.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.145
What is a Bukowski?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.606
A Bukowski?

05:57.774 --> 06:00.317
Well, it's not a Rusty Trombone

06:00.485 --> 06:03.236
or a Gorilla Mask.
A Bukowski is a writer.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.280
A poet?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.741
Come on.
"Notes from a Dirty Old Man"?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.785
"Ham on Rye"?
"Post Office"?

06:09.952 --> 06:11.661
Hm-mm.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.497
Well,

06:13.664 --> 06:16.504
it's good you're continuing your education.
You came to the right place.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.796
You keep your GPA up,

06:20.963 --> 06:22.839
no swearing within earshot,

06:23.007 --> 06:25.175
and stay out of trouble,

06:25.343 --> 06:27.219
so I can keep you

06:27.387 --> 06:29.267
from getting your ass
kicked out this go around.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.264
Capisce?

06:31.432 --> 06:33.308
Yeah, of course.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.976
Plus, how much mayhem
could I possibly cause

06:35.144 --> 06:37.813

tea cozies on the wall?

Look, I can explain.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.977
- You know what? Sir, I can explain.
- Shawn and his friends

07:17.145 --> 07:18.770
- tried to smoke us again.
- Lt wasn't his fault.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.314
- You called me Snoop, racist.
- That's a lie.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.733
You said degrading stuff
about my stature, dipshit...

07:23.901 --> 07:26.945
- I mean, Shawn.
- Sir, it's true. He started it.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.240
- Shawn.
- What?

07:30.408 --> 07:33.994
Come on. You're not actually gonna
buy this side of the story, are you?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.830
You're teasing and fighting
with the new kid already?

07:36.998 --> 07:38.957
And you wonder why
you're a fifth-year senior.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.709
- Dan...
- Sir!

07:40.877 --> 07:42.544
Sir.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.213
He walked in, we were hanging out,
he punched me in the face.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.257
Blame is the first sign
of weakness.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.887
Now apologize.

07:52.054 --> 07:54.055
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that?!

07:56.058 --> 08:00.937
Headmaster?
Language? Demerits?

08:01.105 --> 08:03.106
Does any of that ring
a goddamn bell to you?

08:03.274 --> 08:05.025
This is bullshit.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.902
Tuck in that damn shirt

08:07.069 --> 08:08.570
and be in my office
in 10 minutes.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.742
Come here.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.582
Well, you do haVe a string
of bad luck, don't you?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.959
- That's the worst kid I got.
- I told you.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.003
Yeah?

08:25.171 --> 08:27.047
Well, why don't we try
to change that now?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.757
That's a good idea.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.176
Go make some new friends.

08:33.261 --> 08:35.096
Now.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.683
Sam.
Sam, thank you so much.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.727
You are our savior.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.938
That guy's such a douche.
He does that all the time.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.357
We should hang out sometime.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.565
By the way, I'm Jimmy.
This is Chuck. This is Teddy.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.320
Where are you from? I'm having a hard
time, but I'm thinking it's Manhattan.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.239
I'm getting this tri-state area
kind of thing. New York?

08:52.406 --> 08:54.157
Yeah, it's New York
with that handshake that you're doing.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.327
Okay, calm down.
Look, it's good to meet you guys

08:57.495 --> 08:59.015

the camaraderie

08:59.163 --> 09:01.665

back there, but I gotta...

Why would you... such a dick.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.405
You know what? You guys
hold that thought. I'll be right back.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.116
- Where you goin', man?
- I'm gonna go talk to that girl.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.621
I probably should have
wingmanned that one, huh?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.289
Hi.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.208
I'm sorry.
Do we know you?

13:13.375 --> 13:18.046
- Um...
- This is the eye-fucker from Moore.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.256
Oh my God,
you're the eye-fucker?

13:20.424 --> 13:22.300
I guess I am
the eye-fucker

13:22.468 --> 13:24.344
and I've been
completely called out.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.846
So congratulations.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.848
Well, thank you, thank you.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.893
So now that we've got the
pleasantries out of the way,

13:32.061 --> 13:33.686
do you care to sit down
and join us for a latte?

13:33.854 --> 13:36.231
- Yeah.
- Great.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.067
- I'm Courtney.
- Hi.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.986
And this is Angie.
And you are...?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.863
Uh, Sam.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.241
- Well, nice to meet you, Sam.
- What up?

13:46.408 --> 13:48.076
Hi.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.119
Well, what are you doing

13:50.287 --> 13:53.748
on this glorious sunny day,
young Samuel?

13:53.916 --> 13:55.676
I'm just kind of
hanging out with my friends.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.211
Oh, you have friends.

13:58.379 --> 14:02.090
Well, that's novel.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.425
All my friends are dead
if you were wondering.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.386
Well, except for her,

14:06.554 --> 14:08.304
but she's not really a friend
so I guess that doesn't count.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.348
- Thanks, bitch.
- I love you.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.196
- I loVe you too.
- Make-out session later?

14:14.603 --> 14:18.106
- What's so funny?
- You. You're funny.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.692
He's charming.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.318
God knows I'm trying.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.654
Hold that thought.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.031
Hello.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.075
Yeah.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.119
Okay.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.454
Wow.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.583
Fine. Fine.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.793
Okay, bye.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.630
- We got to jam.
- 10-4.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.966
What do you mean?
Why you going so soon?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.343
We're just... just starting to
haVe so much fun.

14:47.511 --> 14:51.514
It's my mom... she's crazy and she spit
in a bartender's face now.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.433
- So we got to go pick her up.
- Sweet.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.061
Crazy bitch. Sounds like my mom.
They should probably carpool.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.856
That's... he's funny.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.317
You're cute too.

15:02.484 --> 15:05.570
All right. I'm thoroughly bored
with this now.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.530
I'm gonna get some
motherfuckin♪ fudge.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.700
- Do you want any?
- I'm... I'm good on the motherfuckin♪ fudge,

15:10.868 --> 15:13.077
- but thanks, girl.
- Bye.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.246
Nice girl.

15:15.414 --> 15:19.208
So, uh, same time,
same place next weekend?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.044
Yeah.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.880
- Phone, please.
- I'm sorry. What?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.549
So I can put my number in it
so we can make plans.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.967
Do you haVe Asperger's
or something?

15:28.135 --> 15:30.345
I don't know
what's wrong with you.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.472
Well, I just don't think
we're at the swapping...

15:32.640 --> 15:36.309
Swapping digits phase yet.
It's all moving a little fast for me.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.353
Oh, I see.
It's so fast.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.856
Well then, no number for you.
Well done, prince charming.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.942
- Good job.
- Yo, tampon,

15:44.109 --> 15:45.485
we got to go pick up
your alkie mother.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.363
Wait two seconds.
Jesus, Angie.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.406
Hi. Sorry.
Here here.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.784
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.707
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.341
Nice fucking work, dude.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.718
- Will you be my mentor?
- That'll be nice.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.554
- That was amazing.
- Okay, let's not jump on him all at once.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.431
Let's have some coffee
like some ciVilized people.

16:15.599 --> 16:18.643
- You don't even drink coffee.
- ♪Cause it tastes like shit.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.438
"And so I return
to the question at hand."

16:24.108 --> 16:25.984
Do we resign ourselves
to the sad truth

16:26.151 --> 16:28.987
that our existence is purely
an exercise in human folly?

16:29.154 --> 16:33.741
Or do we embrace every moment
of that existence

16:33.909 --> 16:36.577
"and forget about what it might
amount to one day?"

16:36.745 --> 16:39.580
Now we all know
what Camus thinks...

16:39.748 --> 16:41.374
It's fucking "Cammuss."
Crazy, right?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.209
- It's Camus, you idiot.
- Lt is?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.545
Do you guys eVer read?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.588
Sam?

16:50.342 --> 16:51.884
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.053
Uh, uh, sit down.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.348
Uh, yeah.
In a second.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.058
I've got to tell you
something, though.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.269
I, um...

17:03.647 --> 17:05.732
met a girl.

17:05.898 --> 17:07.775
And one that's not
in a straitjacket,

17:07.943 --> 17:09.609
which is a pretty big
improvement for me.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.113
- Sam.
- And then

17:12.281 --> 17:14.281
I'm actually pretty sure
I completely aced

17:14.450 --> 17:17.367
my literature presentation

17:17.536 --> 17:19.162
thanks to your
recommended reading.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.747
- I'm going out on the streets with this...
- Sam.

17:20.914 --> 17:23.332
'Cause I had no idea that
French-Moroccan existentialism

17:23.500 --> 17:25.501
could be just
so damn fascinating.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.171
Sam, I just got off the phone.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.340
Your mother can't pay
for your school anymore.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.600
We had a good run.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.439
You know, you were, uh...

17:46.607 --> 17:48.524
You were cool,
my friends were cool.

17:48.692 --> 17:52.945
I got a little Bukowski
out of it,

17:53.113 --> 17:54.614
but I guess at the end
of the day,

17:54.782 --> 17:57.116
eVen my mom's tits
aren't recession-proof.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.369
Yeah.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.430
Come on, man.
I left my ID in my room.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.918
I don't feel like
going to get it.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.393
- Can you please just giVe me a drink?
- Nice try, junior.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.354
He's with me.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.651
Yeah, I... I'm with her.

18:31.819 --> 18:35.655
That's why I don't have my ID,
because I left it in our room.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.699
So how about you
just pour me that drink?

18:41.161 --> 18:43.246
While you're at it,
you can refill hers

18:43.413 --> 18:46.290
and when you're done, you can bring it
to the table. How about that?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.838
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.925
And also, thank you.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.971
You looked like you needed it.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.891
Oh boy, I did.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.438
I actually still do.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.569
Um, I'm Sam, by the way.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.656
- I'm Alison.
- Good to meet you, Alison.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.952
Rough night?

19:28.292 --> 19:30.168
Gotcha.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.920
- Me too.
- Yeah.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.721
My husband's mistress

19:41.889 --> 19:43.472
showed up at my house tonight

19:43.640 --> 19:47.685
to complain to me about
how he's cheating on her tonight.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.354
S-s-shit.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.690
I mean, I'm sure
that he can explain.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.902
He's really good at explaining.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.196
He's a very good explainer.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.780
- Like, he could've explained...
- Yes, okay. Right, look,

19:59.948 --> 20:01.824
- Okay, here we go.
- That I was married...

20:01.992 --> 20:03.743
Why don't we do this?
Why don't we do this?

20:03.911 --> 20:05.286
Your husband's
a fucking asshole.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.371
Okay?
I would...

20:14.087 --> 20:15.963
I mean, what?
He goes out

20:16.131 --> 20:18.799
and he cheats on you?

20:18.967 --> 20:20.468
Twice?

20:21.762 --> 20:24.430
And then he fuckin'
tries to explain?

20:24.598 --> 20:27.266
What are you talking about?
Who the hell cheats on you?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.812
I mean, look at you.
You're beautiful.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.380
You'Ve got these eyes,
they sparkle.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.566
They're like diamonds, you know?

20:37.861 --> 20:39.153
God, what?

20:39.321 --> 20:42.281
That was really bad.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.663
That just...

20:48.830 --> 20:52.375
- won't sound genuine.
- Oh good.

20:52.542 --> 20:55.503
No, it's a good thing.

20:58.882 --> 21:04.220
So... so you go to school
around here or something?

21:08.016 --> 21:09.433
Yeah, kinda.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.561
- Kinda.
- Kinda?

21:15.565 --> 21:18.192
How old are you, Sam?

21:22.864 --> 21:24.907
18.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.452
Yeah, I should probably

21:28.620 --> 21:30.496
get out of here and get going.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.290
You probably should.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.293
I'll buy you another drink.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.713
My husband probably
shouldn't haVe cheated on me.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.050
- Twice.
- Twice.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.971
So...

21:48.974 --> 21:51.017
- So...
- So...

23:21.108 --> 23:23.609
I'm gonna stay in town tonight.

23:23.777 --> 23:27.613
Just tell Riley that I love him.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.407
Okay?

23:29.574 --> 23:31.450
Okay. Bye.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.172
Is this creepy?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.634
Creepy?

23:48.802 --> 23:51.303
This is freaking amazing.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.478
This is crazy.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.732
I'm not that old, you know.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.484
I'm not that young.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.029
Technically I'm not even
a senior anymore

24:09.197 --> 24:12.158
because I can't pay
for my tuition.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.663
This is fun, right?

24:17.831 --> 24:19.623
Yeah.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.834
This is fun.

24:24.212 --> 24:26.422
You haVe an amazing ass.

24:28.508 --> 24:32.011
So hey, you wanna
have fun again?

24:32.179 --> 24:34.054
Absolutely.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.015
I could have fun all night.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.933
- I bet you can.
- I can.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.227
- Good.
- Great.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.188
- Less talking, more doing.
- Okay.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.757
All right, so let me
get this straight.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.884
This chick was hot,

25:12.052 --> 25:13.928
brought you to her suite,
got you drunk,

25:14.095 --> 25:15.513
had sex with you multiple times

25:15.680 --> 25:18.933
and left you with a fucking
check in the morning?

25:19.100 --> 25:20.935
Yeah.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.479
That's fucking amazing. Why don't shit
like that ever happen to me, Jimmy?

25:23.647 --> 25:26.148
It can.
It can.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.151
Yeah.
Sam, she's got friends, right?

25:29.319 --> 25:32.696
- Yeah, she's got friends.
- And you haVe money problems.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.281
- Yes, I haVe money problems.
- Okay, so?

25:34.449 --> 25:36.534
- So what?
- So hook it up.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.577
Dude, it's not what you think.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.121
I don't even know
if I'm gonna call this girl again.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.873
Okay, this is like
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.250
Yeah, or like
a once-in-a-week time thing.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.217
- You fuckin♪ know it.
- You know what I mean?

25:46.294 --> 25:48.170
Guys, stop.
Come on.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.632
Look, if you haVen't
already guessed it,

25:51.800 --> 25:54.218
- I'm a Virgin, okay?
- Yeah, I know.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.638
$500 is good.
I get it, okay?

25:57.806 --> 25:59.473
I don't know
what you did with it,

25:59.641 --> 26:02.142
but the fact of the matter is

26:02.310 --> 26:04.144
if we could parlay that
into two grand a week,

26:04.312 --> 26:07.856
Sam, we could pay for your tuition
in two months or less.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.704
Like that. You could stay in school
and we could all hang out again.

26:10.735 --> 26:14.071
Plus we'd be bringing joy to
unhappily-married women eVerywhere.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.949
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Yes!

26:17.117 --> 26:19.201
And Teddy, by the way,
great Valid point.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.536
Selfless... I like
where your head's at.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.121
- Thank you, sir.
- He made a valid point.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.123
I'm just saying.
The fact of the matter is

26:24.291 --> 26:26.166
there are probably
tons... tons

26:26.334 --> 26:28.210
of smoking hot milfs

26:28.378 --> 26:30.254
waiting for some young
guilt-free kielbasa.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.007
All you haVe to do is make the connection,
pimp this shit out

26:33.174 --> 26:35.551
and it's done. It's a fuckin♪ wrap...
Bills on you.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.971
You want to lay in bills?
You want to take a bath in bills?

26:39.139 --> 26:42.057
Okay, could you please stop listening
in on our fucking conversation?

26:42.225 --> 26:44.101
I'm sorry.
It just sounds awesome.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.436
I mean, if you ever
need any help...

26:45.604 --> 26:46.937
Yeah yeah, sure.
We'll giVe you a fuckin♪ call.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.939
Just stop looking at me.

26:49.107 --> 26:52.276
So...

27:01.953 --> 27:03.829
Hey, do you think
we can carve out

27:03.997 --> 27:05.873
a little bit to do
a scholarship for a kid

27:06.041 --> 27:07.481
who's having some
financial problems?

27:07.584 --> 27:10.794
- What?
- Well, you said we had a little extra.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.005
Well, not entirely extra.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.590
It's for Sam Lowell.

27:14.758 --> 27:18.510
We're a boarding school,
not a commune.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.158
I think we should concentrate
on the kids that are already here

27:21.306 --> 27:24.933
as opposed to some charity case
you might want to bring in.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.895
Bruce, this is not
a charity case.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.105
All right?
This is a good kid.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.193
I mean, what do you think
we do here as teachers?

27:32.359 --> 27:34.026
We're here to inspire.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.403
Well, I'm all for inspiring,

27:36.571 --> 27:38.947
but we're in a recession.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.991
- I know that.
- I can't eVen get enough money

27:41.159 --> 27:42.660
for new band instruments.

27:42.827 --> 27:47.164
Coach Jackson wants new turf
for his lacrosse field.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.000
I'd like a little money
for my Women's Lib program.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.835
What do they need
to know about women?

27:52.003 --> 27:54.797
You tell the good-looking
ones they're smart

27:54.964 --> 27:57.216
and you tell the smart ones
they're good-looking.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.093
Look, I'm trying to have
a decent conversation...

27:59.260 --> 28:02.262
This is a conversation.
You're not listening.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.973
- Sir?
- What is it, Cy, what?!

28:05.141 --> 28:07.267
Sam Lowell is back on campus.

28:07.435 --> 28:09.061
He says he can pay
for his tuition.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.357
Hello?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.401
- She answer it?
- I don't... hello?

28:15.568 --> 28:17.361
Is that my mom?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.322
Ali, it's Sam.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.534
- Sam?
- No, it's for your mom.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.745
- It's Sam.
- Hey.

28:26.913 --> 28:30.374
- Hey, who was that?
- Uh, it's...

28:30.542 --> 28:33.794
- just a friend.
- Your mom's a cougar.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.005
So I'm glad you called.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.966
Yeah, me too.

28:39.134 --> 28:43.137
Look, anyway, I was
just thinking about

28:43.304 --> 28:45.889
how great last weekend was.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.892
And I was wondering if maybe
you weren't busy this weekend,

28:49.060 --> 28:50.811
- we could...
- Do it again?

28:50.979 --> 28:53.772
- Yeah.
- I thought you had to leaVe school.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.483
No, I do.
Well, I did.

28:56.651 --> 29:01.029
Anyway, that's kind of
what I wanted to talk to you about.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.283
I don't know if this
sounds weird or anything,

29:04.451 --> 29:06.326
but I was wondering
if maybe this weekend

29:06.494 --> 29:08.370
you could bring
some of your friends...

29:08.538 --> 29:10.414
Sit your ass down.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.458
And I could bring
some of my friends.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.252
And then some of your friends
could give some of my friends,

29:15.420 --> 29:17.171
uh, some letters too,

29:17.338 --> 29:20.424
you know, to help
for my education fund?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.718
- Oh.
- Or not.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.553
I mean, it's totally fine.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.181
It was just an idea.
Just a stupid...

29:27.348 --> 29:28.807
It's not a stupid idea.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.893
Ask him if he has any friends.

29:31.060 --> 29:32.811
- They told...
- Are you positiVe he's here?

29:32.979 --> 29:34.271
- I'm dead positiVe.
- In here?

29:34.439 --> 29:36.356
Yes... I mean, 95% positiVe.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.275
- Hello?
- Sam?

29:38.443 --> 29:39.485
Sam?

29:41.279 --> 29:42.821
- Sam?
- What?

29:44.324 --> 29:47.785
Hold on.
He asked me.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.370
- Alison?
- Tell him yes.

29:50.538 --> 29:53.081
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

29:53.249 --> 29:54.369
What's your fuckin♪ problem?

29:54.501 --> 29:56.418
Alison?

30:00.423 --> 30:01.924
Boys?

30:03.218 --> 30:06.345
- Dan-o.
- Sir.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.263
Um, sir,

30:08.431 --> 30:10.057
if I may,

30:10.225 --> 30:12.100
I think that we might
haVe found a solution

30:12.268 --> 30:15.354
to Sam's little economic issue.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.356
A solution?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.483
Uh, yeah. A job.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.568
A job?

30:23.655 --> 30:26.156
A job that pays
$20,000 a semester?

30:27.408 --> 30:29.243
What is it?
Ponzi scheme?

30:29.410 --> 30:32.204
- Nah, man.
- Well, sir,

30:32.372 --> 30:34.790
my dad has some work
we can do for his company.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.210
And see, it's a tax
shelter kind of thing.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.170
- Tax shelter.
- Tax shelter.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.214
Yeah, like a 501(c), sir.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.466
- Is this a fuckin♪ joke?
- Sir?

30:44.634 --> 30:47.803
Um... we, uh...

30:47.971 --> 30:49.638
Sam has a down payment.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.934
I can see it.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.435
Okay.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.400
Are you boys selling drugs?

31:20.879 --> 31:23.422
All right.
I'll bite.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.758
Welcome back, Sam.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.137
WhateVer you're doing,

31:30.305 --> 31:31.930
keep it clean.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.349
Yeah.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.393
They're young boys,
pick of the litter,

31:36.561 --> 31:38.228
and they're a hell of a lot cheaper
than a pair of Louis Vuittons.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.314
Which pair? Wait,
what are you talking about?

31:40.481 --> 31:43.191
Judy, quit it.
We're not doing this.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.519
- Will you stop?
- Doing what?

31:44.569 --> 31:46.570
Why do you two
always exclude me?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.614
It's♪cause
I'm younger, isn't it?

31:48.781 --> 31:50.407
You just don't think
I understand...

31:50.575 --> 31:52.451
- Enough.
- Whoa.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.537
- What?
- Testy. Shit.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.456
For your information,

31:57.624 --> 31:59.499
Alison here is acting all bitchy

31:59.667 --> 32:01.543
because I want to set up
some paid playdates

32:01.711 --> 32:03.086
with a few boys from Moore.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.713
- Playdates?
- Yes.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.382
- You mean for shagging?
- Mm-hmm, I think it's so cool.

32:07.550 --> 32:10.177
I think it sounds awful
and completely illegal.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.637
Yes, it is, Judy.

32:11.804 --> 32:14.056
Stop being such
a fucking square, Mary.

32:14.223 --> 32:18.101
Mary is not a square.
She's old fashioned.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.549
I'm sorry, but marrying an agent

32:19.687 --> 32:21.480
who's gonna help our little Ginger here
with her career

32:21.648 --> 32:24.168
and give her a life of arm candy
doesn't make her old fashioned.

32:24.275 --> 32:27.235
- It makes her a fucking moron.
- Oh my God, excuse me.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.030
Okay, stop.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.575
Mary, don't listen to her.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.786
And you, I've made myself clear.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.371
I don't think we should do this.

32:37.538 --> 32:41.458
- What is the big deal? You already did it.
- And look at you.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.335
It wasn't like that.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.087
- Really?
- No.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.589
You gaVe him a check though.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.716
You gaVe him a check?

32:49.884 --> 32:51.843
Mary, I loVe you,

32:52.011 --> 32:54.371
but we're much older than you
and there are certain things...

32:54.430 --> 32:57.057
She is in just as shitty
a relationship as you.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.684
Stop justifying this.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.979
- We all know your husband...
- Fine! I fucked him.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.272
I paid him.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.608
But I was just trying
to help him out.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.486
He's a decent kid
who was haVing a hard time.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.613
So why don't you want
to help out your kid again?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.115
What is the big deal?

33:13.282 --> 33:14.700
It was a mistake, Judy.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.285
Oh, please.
It's a mistake?

33:17.453 --> 33:20.706
Are you kidding me? It's a mistake now
that we want to have some fuckin♪ fun?

33:20.873 --> 33:23.667
But with you it wasn't
a mistake, right?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.878
Right. No.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.256
- Alison.
- Mary.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.508
I think it sounds inVigorating.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.428
You know what?
Let's just set it up for us.

33:34.595 --> 33:35.929
And we'll find
some new girls for Sam.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.806
What?

33:37.974 --> 33:41.184
I need this.
We need this.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.104
- Come on.
- You know, I don't know about this.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.897
Oh shut up, Mary. When was
the last time someone fucked you

33:46.065 --> 33:48.692
- so hard you couldn't walk?
- Oh my God.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.986
Jesus fucking Christ, Judy.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.030
You know, now that
I think about it,

33:53.197 --> 33:55.532
I think it sounds really fun!

33:55.700 --> 33:57.576
- Are they fit?
- Fit

33:57.744 --> 33:59.536
and they are willing.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.581
It's so true.
There is nothing sweeter

34:02.749 --> 34:04.541
than a boy's worship
of the female body.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.627
Excuse me.
Who are you again?

34:07.795 --> 34:09.379
Oh, this is Dominica, darling.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.132
- She's from South America.
- I met her at the PTA last week.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.301
She's our new BFF.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.678
By the way, you haVe

It's a funny story.

37:15.107 --> 37:17.859
Alison had a little more
than "nothing"

37:18.027 --> 37:19.903
with the lead singer
of Depeche Mode

37:20.071 --> 37:22.656
- in her moody early♪20s!
- Do you eVer shut up?

37:22.823 --> 37:24.741
No.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.785

37:26.953 --> 37:28.828
- but our...
- Groupie.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.830

Okay, we were groupies.

37:33.376 --> 37:37.587
was so into Mr. Gahan's

37:37.755 --> 37:40.048
Shut up, Judy.
You just need to relax.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.925
- He rocked, right?
- Relax.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.512
You relax. At least you weren't a groupie
for INXS or something.

49:39.059 --> 49:41.560
Good night.

49:43.563 --> 49:45.106
Bye.

49:47.526 --> 49:51.028

50:39.494 --> 50:40.786
Yo!

50:45.625 --> 50:47.501
Sam?

50:47.669 --> 50:50.421
- Hey.

50:50.589 --> 50:52.715
- Yeah, just...

50:56.344 --> 50:59.221
Sam Lowell, I never

That makes two of us, brother.

51:01.308 --> 51:03.642
Oh hey, I got

51:11.693 --> 51:13.569
Hey, you want to grab
something to eat?

51:13.737 --> 51:15.571
I think the last shuttle's
pretty crammed.

51:15.739 --> 51:17.656
I'll take you whereVer
you want to go

51:17.824 --> 51:21.077
and you can tell me all about how
they screwed up The Village.

51:21.244 --> 51:24.038
- Sounds good, man, but I got...
- I got, uh...

51:24.206 --> 51:26.791
- I got, uh...
- Work.

51:26.958 --> 51:28.834
You're working now?

51:29.002 --> 51:31.253
Not like...
Well, not like this work,

51:31.421 --> 51:34.298
but I do haVe, like, work work
in a little bit.

51:34.466 --> 51:38.010
Chuck's dad needs me
to drive around

51:38.178 --> 51:41.722
some of his business associates

51:41.890 --> 51:45.226
acting as, like, a Valet. I don't
really know what the hell that means.

51:45.393 --> 51:47.686
But I think I've got
to wear a tux.

51:47.854 --> 51:49.980
Tux. Fuck.

51:51.233 --> 51:52.858
Sorry.

51:53.026 --> 51:55.319
All right.
Well, maybe another time.

51:55.487 --> 51:58.614
You know what? I'd like to haVe you oVer

51:58.782 --> 52:00.741
introduce you to my family.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.078
Yeah, man,
I'd loVe to meet your family.

52:04.246 --> 52:05.579
Really?

52:05.747 --> 52:08.040
- Yeah.
- All right.

52:09.084 --> 52:13.170
Well, you haVe
a fun time at work.

52:14.714 --> 52:17.383
Shut off the light
when you're done.

52:17.551 --> 52:19.426
- Yeah.
- There's a switch right oVer here.

52:19.594 --> 52:21.220
Okay.

52:23.890 --> 52:25.683
Oh man.

52:30.438 --> 52:33.691
Mmn, so what do you think of him?

52:35.610 --> 52:37.778
Strong hands, nice lips...

52:37.946 --> 52:39.530
I definitely approVe.

52:39.698 --> 52:41.490
- What, balloon boy?
- Mm-hmm.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.784
Are you completely off your rocker?
He's a child.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.286
And what the fuck is Chuck?

52:45.453 --> 52:47.413
Cock don't haVe an age, Mary.

52:47.581 --> 52:49.206
It's true.

52:49.374 --> 52:52.585
You know what?
Fuck this.

52:52.752 --> 52:54.872
I'm getting a diVorce and marrying
someone my own age.

52:57.549 --> 52:59.216
Well, that's
a little oVerdramatic.

52:59.384 --> 53:01.302
Right?

53:01.469 --> 53:03.512
What the hell her
fuckin♪ problem is.

53:03.680 --> 53:06.599
So seriously, how much
do you think he'd cost?

53:06.766 --> 53:08.809
I think you can
get him for fiVe.

53:08.977 --> 53:10.936
Fuck yeah.

53:11.104 --> 53:12.646
That's just a charity case.

53:12.814 --> 53:15.357
Look at Ali.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.401
That bitch.

53:17.569 --> 53:19.209
She's gonna fuck him

53:19.237 --> 53:21.739
Ali!
Whoo!

53:21.907 --> 53:23.908
OVer here, girlfriend!

53:24.910 --> 53:27.203

53:27.370 --> 53:30.497
- Girls.
- Ooh, aren't you yummy?

53:30.665 --> 53:33.542
- I'm Judy.
- Jesus.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.711
What?
He's cute.

53:38.632 --> 53:39.924
So where've you been?

53:40.091 --> 53:41.842
I've missed you.

53:42.010 --> 53:45.471
Sorry. I've just been
really busy with Riley.

53:47.307 --> 53:49.683
Really? You'Ve been busy
with a fuckin♪ three-year-old?

53:49.851 --> 53:52.269
Gimme a break.
It's fuckin♪ bullshit.

53:52.437 --> 53:55.522
- Excuse...
- Nothing. You're busy. You're busy. Sorry.

53:55.690 --> 53:57.149
You're busy with Riley.
You're busy with this balloon boy.

53:57.317 --> 54:00.986
Jude, Jude, what the hell
are you talking?

54:01.154 --> 54:02.988
What are you talking about?

54:03.156 --> 54:04.698
Look at you. You're trashed
at my son's birthday party.

54:04.866 --> 54:06.242
So what?
I'm haVing a good time.

54:06.409 --> 54:09.245
No, you're here to scope out
teenagers for your weekly hotel party.

54:09.412 --> 54:12.248
Oh yeah? Well, it's not
at a hotel anymore, babe.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.584
- What?
- They moVed it.

54:16.878 --> 54:19.797
For your informa-ti-on,
they got a rental.

54:19.965 --> 54:22.758
Oh and Mary here's getting
a divorce, by the way.

54:22.926 --> 54:25.761
Judy!
Fuck's sake!

54:27.180 --> 54:29.306
Nicely done.

54:31.476 --> 54:32.685
Enjoy the cake.

54:32.852 --> 54:35.312
Fuckin♪ party pooper.

54:42.862 --> 54:44.321
Sam!

54:44.489 --> 54:47.491
Oh shit.

54:47.659 --> 54:48.909
Just relax.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.078
Sam, over here.

54:51.246 --> 54:53.122
Don't be a fucking rat.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.082
He's not a fucking rat, bro.

54:57.127 --> 54:58.711
Sam.

54:58.878 --> 55:01.630
What's up, man?

55:02.632 --> 55:03.966
Take a walk with me.

55:13.977 --> 55:16.395
- Hop on.
- Excuse me?

55:16.563 --> 55:19.523
I need to talk to you
about something.

55:19.691 --> 55:22.026
- You do?
- Yes.

55:22.193 --> 55:23.986
I do.

55:25.905 --> 55:27.656
Right.
Well, here's the thing:

55:27.824 --> 55:30.617
see, I'm supposed to go
into town with my buddies

55:30.785 --> 55:32.828
and I've neVer really been
on a motorcycle before, so...

55:32.996 --> 55:34.913
Just jump on the goddamn bike.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.888
So what'd you want
to talk to me about?

55:51.056 --> 55:52.973
Quit your job.

55:53.975 --> 55:56.852
- What?
- Quit your job!

55:58.355 --> 56:00.481
Look, Dan, before we
go any further, man,

56:00.648 --> 56:02.566
I think I should
explain something!

56:02.734 --> 56:05.736
I got a scholarship for you.

56:05.904 --> 56:07.321
What?!

56:07.489 --> 56:09.823
I got a scholarship for ya!

56:09.991 --> 56:11.909
I told Bruce, "Fuck you,"

56:12.077 --> 56:13.911
told the board, "Fuck you."

56:14.079 --> 56:15.788
I'm the boss.

56:15.955 --> 56:17.790
GiVe this kid a scholarship.

56:17.957 --> 56:20.876
He deserves it."
Then they did it!

56:22.128 --> 56:23.879
So you can quit your job,

56:24.047 --> 56:25.923
go back to studying now.

56:26.091 --> 56:28.300
Thank you!

56:28.468 --> 56:30.052
I thought I was in trouble!

56:30.220 --> 56:32.012
Nah nah.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.680
I was just fuckin♪ with you.

56:37.769 --> 56:39.603
Are you in trouble?

56:43.274 --> 56:45.651
Uniforms. Put♪em on.

56:45.819 --> 56:48.987
There's a bathroom.
You can use it if you want to to change,

56:49.155 --> 56:53.617
but remember real women
like the fantasy of youth.

56:53.785 --> 56:55.994
White is like heaven.

56:56.162 --> 56:58.080
Real women like heaven.

56:58.248 --> 57:00.124
And boys?

57:00.291 --> 57:02.543
You're about to be dealing
with some real women.

57:02.710 --> 57:04.086
Jimmy, what the fuck?

57:04.254 --> 57:05.963
Shit. Hey.

57:06.131 --> 57:08.048
- Sorry I started without you.
- What are you...

57:08.216 --> 57:10.843
Everyone, say hello
to your founding father Sam.

57:11.010 --> 57:12.886
Clap.

57:17.142 --> 57:22.896
- We got to talk.
- Talk amongst yourself for a second.

57:23.064 --> 57:25.649
- We got to shut this down.
- What?

57:25.817 --> 57:27.693
You fucking ratted on us,
didn't you?

57:27.861 --> 57:29.278
He doesn't know anything.
Back off.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.071
Thank God.

57:31.239 --> 57:33.782
Guys, we got to quit
while we're ahead here.

57:33.950 --> 57:35.826
- Why?
- Because he took me out

57:35.994 --> 57:37.494
and he told me that he was
gonna pay for my tuition, that's why.

57:37.662 --> 57:39.037
Fucking Dan Fox?

57:39.205 --> 57:41.039
Dan.
Look, man, he's a cool guy.

57:41.207 --> 57:44.710
- I don't want to betray his trust anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

57:44.878 --> 57:47.212
- It's the right fucking thing to do, Jimmy.
- I agree.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.381
This whole thing
is just subVersiVe.

57:49.549 --> 57:51.884
At first I thought
Mary loVed me.

57:52.051 --> 57:54.052
Then I found out
she just wanted me for my body.

57:54.220 --> 57:57.014
Yeah, and last week,
Dominica used a dildo

57:57.182 --> 57:58.932
on me, bro.

57:59.100 --> 58:01.018
So what?!

58:01.186 --> 58:03.937
Who gives a shit?
Open up your eyes, brothers.

58:04.105 --> 58:06.398
This little thing that we started

58:06.566 --> 58:09.943
has turned into something bigger
than we could ever imagine.

58:10.111 --> 58:13.071
Sam, this is
a cash cow business here.

58:13.239 --> 58:15.782
If we keep this up,
we can start franchising soon.

58:15.950 --> 58:18.030
- Franchising?
- Patrick's got a guy in Connecticut...

58:18.077 --> 58:19.912
His dad owns
like a chain of hotels.

58:20.079 --> 58:23.081
- What are you... Patrick?
- I thought you hated that guy, Jimmy.

58:23.249 --> 58:24.041
When opportunity knocks,

58:24.209 --> 58:25.250
- you got to take it.
- Okay, stop.

58:25.418 --> 58:27.586
This is our chance to go
big leagues with it.

58:27.754 --> 58:29.838
James, come on, man.

58:30.006 --> 58:32.049
It'll be fine.
Let's just put this puppy to sleep.

58:34.010 --> 58:37.513
Fine, but guys, for me, please.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.098
We can end it.
Just giVe me tonight, okay?

58:40.266 --> 58:42.142
I mean, Sam,
there's people at the door.

58:42.310 --> 58:44.436
We can't cancel. The recruits
are all dressed up and excited.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.063
Teddy, what do you say?
You'Ve known me the longest.

58:46.231 --> 58:48.607
What do you say?
One more night, one more party,

58:48.775 --> 58:50.192
all of us together.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.153
Fuck the girls,
fuck the bullshit.

58:53.321 --> 58:54.821
Please.

58:54.989 --> 58:56.907
Let's celebrate, huh?

58:57.075 --> 58:58.951
- Fine fine.
- Yeah.

58:59.118 --> 59:00.398
Okay, but look,
I'm serious, man.

59:00.495 --> 59:02.329
- There's no more lying.
- No more lying.

59:02.497 --> 59:04.623
After tonight.
One more night of lying.

59:04.791 --> 59:05.958
Bring it in.

59:10.213 --> 59:11.964
- Sam?
- Courtney?

59:12.131 --> 59:15.133
Oh shit.

59:17.345 --> 59:19.972
- What are you doing here?
- I was just walking my dog

59:20.139 --> 59:21.932
and I thought I saw
my mom come up here.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.312
Your mom?
No, that's impossible.

59:27.480 --> 59:29.815
Um, do you liVe around here?

59:29.983 --> 59:32.234
Uh, yeah.
Like a block away.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.570
No shit.

59:34.737 --> 59:36.405
So what are you doing here?

59:36.573 --> 59:38.448
Um, Chuck's parents are in town

59:38.616 --> 59:41.785
and they're doing a little bingo
for cancer thing. Just helping out.

59:41.953 --> 59:43.579
Aw, cool.

59:43.746 --> 59:45.622
Wait, what are you...
What are you doing?

59:45.790 --> 59:47.374
I'll help.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.668
What do you mean you'll help?

59:49.836 --> 59:52.629
Well, I'm done with homework.
You're here.

59:52.797 --> 59:55.340
I'm here.
I'll help.

59:55.508 --> 59:58.844
You know what?
How about this?

59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.846
If you don't have
anything else to do...

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:03.473
They don't really
need me in there...

01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:06.393
Why don't we just
go back to your place?

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.395
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:11.481
I mean, as much as I love
just hooking up

01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:13.567
in the back of your Prius...

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:15.694
You know, we've been dating
a little over a month

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.904
and I've never seen your place.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.159
What do you say?

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.593
Oh no.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.386
Huh? What?

01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:47.225
Headmaster Fox is your dad?

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:49.144
Oh shit.
You didn't know?

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.396
- I thought everyone knew.
- Nah, I'm new.

01:00:51.564 --> 01:00:53.607
Oh, that's right.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:55.651
Well, that's my dad

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.819
and that's
my train wreck of a mother.

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.863
Congratulations
on your ignorance.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:01.511
Now you get to do
the dean's daughter.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.618
Wait, hang on.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.205
Come on.
Shawn?

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:09.706
My brother?

01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:10.916
Yup.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.668
I hear he's a total dick
at school.

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.086
Yeah, you could say that.

01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:18.131
So now that we're done
with the genealogy,

01:01:18.299 --> 01:01:21.093
what do you think of my new bra?

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.304
Sexy? I got matching
panties too.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:26.723
- Wait wait wait. Wait a second.
- Why?

01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:29.851
Don't worry.
My dad's working late at your school

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.895
and you did say
you want to maximize

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.939
the space in my room
Versus my hybrid toaster.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.942
So let's maximize...

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.194
I gotta kinda
tell you something.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:42.322
- You're a virgin?
- No.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.366
Oh, great.
Neither am I.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.410
I'm really horny
and my bed is really comfy

01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:49.329
and we've waited a month
so speak now or forever hold your piece.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.750
What is it?

01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:04.428
Doesn't matter anymore.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:17.315
♪ I fell in love with a girl ♪

01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:21.027
♪ She tastes like lemonade ♪

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:23.488
♪ She tastes like lemonade. ♪

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.261
Oh shit.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.180
Oh my God.

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:50.432
Good morning, Sam.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.645
This is the girl
sans straitjacket?

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.523
Daniel.

01:02:59.817 --> 01:03:01.568
Oh, this is perfect.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:06.782
- You know each other?
- What is going on?

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:11.036
I found your mother
at a high school party down the street

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.955
- with a 17-year-old boy.
- 18.

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.540
Classy.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.085
- I should probably go.
- No no no.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:21.338
Why don't you stay, will you?

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:26.134
Look, Dan, man...

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.969
Sam, man.

01:03:39.398 --> 01:03:41.650
So, Sam,

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:46.738
you have anything
to do with this?

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.240
Huh?!

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.162
'Cause Judy's date
was your little dick friend Jimmy.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.748
- Oh yeah?
- Uh-huh.

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.792
Dad.

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:03.421
- Yeah, baby?
- He was with me last night...

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.758
as you can see.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.387
Well,

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:13.306
it seems like

01:04:13.474 --> 01:04:16.226
everybody was getting laid
last night and I got fucked.

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.480
So...

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:24.401
- you wanna get some breakfast?
- No thank you, sir.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.653
- Dan.
- No thanks, man. I'm good.

01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:30.323
Judy, I'd like to pick up
on that conversation we were having

01:04:30.491 --> 01:04:32.284
over eggs and bacon.

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:34.286
Fuck you.

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:36.538
Or not.

01:04:42.587 --> 01:04:45.005
All right.

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.591
Why don't you two
lovebirds work it out?

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:54.973
Now talk amongst yourselves.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:04.274
What were you doing
at that house last night?

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:09.446
- Uh...
- I need to know.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.531
I don't know.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.325
You really think you can
I-don't-know your way

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:15.493
out of my family drama?

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:20.707
- Well?
- What? It's not what you think, okay?

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.083
What do I think, Sam?

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:24.753
I don't know what you think.
I don't know.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.551
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Just leave.

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:56.368
You okay?

01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:58.828
Now, please.

01:06:05.169 --> 01:06:07.712
- Courtney, look...
- Get out!

01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:29.484
We're done.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.444
Dream's over, bro.

01:06:31.612 --> 01:06:34.739
I'm sorry, man.
I really fucked this one up.

01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:38.326
Nah, we all fucked up.

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.787
Just a little louder.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.709
Hey.

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:48.003
Do me a favor.
If you see Courtney,

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.214
tell her to say hi
to Judy for me.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:53.633
You're such an asshole, Jimmy.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.593
I'm sorry I have
feelings, buttdick.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.727
- Sam.
- Alison, hi.

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.819
I bet you think
that's my husband, don't you?

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.615
I don't know.

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:21.327
He's a friend...
Someone...

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.496
My subcontractor.

01:07:23.664 --> 01:07:25.457
Oh, that's the subcontractor.

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:28.001
Okay.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:31.921
So, hey, where you heading?

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:38.762
Ah...

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:41.222

Is that a black eye?

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:10.145
Yeah.

01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:15.649
Um, look, here's...
Here's... here's the thing:

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:19.069
My friends are gone,

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:23.700
um...

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.618
your daughter won't talk to me

01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:27.586
and I can barely look you
in the eyes anymore.

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:33.292
I can't concentrate in class.
I can't concentrate outside of class.

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.336
Your son just...

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:36.880
came and kicked
the ever-living shit out of me

01:09:37.046 --> 01:09:38.756
and I can't write anymore.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:43.511
So I'm just going to talk
for a minute.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.919
And you can just shut me up
whenever you feel like, okay?

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:47.807
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.643
All right, so my friends...

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:55.732
you know, the ones who were
pooling all their money together

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.984
to pay for my tuition...

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:01.779
Um...

01:10:01.947 --> 01:10:04.699
that money that we
pulled together was dirty.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.368
All right.

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:09.287
So what I'm basically
trying to tell you

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.372
is that we started
an escort service

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.750
that catered to your wife
and all of her friends.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:15.793
And I swear to God I had no idea

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:18.004
that it was your...

01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:21.966
That it was your wife.
And her friends

01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:24.802
were all just fuckin'...

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:27.639
Once this whole thing
started, man,

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:32.644
I couldn't stop it.
I really really...

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:34.270
It was going just really well

01:10:34.438 --> 01:10:36.022
and then you came
and you told me

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.816
that you got the school
to pay for my... my tuition

01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:40.818
and I felt awful.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.948
I just felt fuckin♪ awful.

01:10:45.115 --> 01:10:46.741
And I wanted to tell you about it,
but I couldn't.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.785
I didn't tell you about it,

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:53.248
so then I went to the rental house
where we would,

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.255
you know, do everything
and I tried to stop it.

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:58.753
But I didn't stop it there because
I figured, "What the fuck?"

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.797
One night. One night.
One more time.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:04.884
"Let's have one more time.
We'll go one more time."

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:07.595
But it's not gonna be
one more time.

01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:13.893
Even if you hadn't caught us,
it wasn't gonna be one more time.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:15.581
And the only reason
you didn't catch me

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.981
was♪cause I was out
alone with your...

01:11:18.148 --> 01:11:20.024
I was at your house...
Your house!

01:11:20.192 --> 01:11:22.068
With your
fuckin♪ daughter.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.870
Post script: I had no idea
it was your daughter,

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.076
but...

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.289
I tried to come clean with her.

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.457
And...

01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:41.921
I don't know, man.
I'm just really fuckin♪ lost.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.965
And I know that you're probably

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.800
just super pissed

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.011
and you don't care,

01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:50.054
but...

01:11:58.022 --> 01:12:00.606
Are you rolling a joint?

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:06.988
I'm listening.

01:12:16.373 --> 01:12:18.249
You're not even mad?

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:20.835
Kinda.

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.670
Nah, not really.

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.839
No.

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:28.968
Come on, man.
I knew what was going on.

01:12:31.263 --> 01:12:33.639
- You did?
- Huh?

01:12:33.807 --> 01:12:35.641
- You did?
- Well, of course I did.

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.977
Find all your buddies
with a bunch of older women?

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.355
And magical cash?

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:43.691
I mean, I'm stupid,
but I'm not a fuckin♪ idiot.

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.861
And you know what?
You said it.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:49.280
You didn't fuck my wife.

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.200
You didn't know Courtney
was my daughter.

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.579
And you did what you needed
to do to stay here.

01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:59.082
- So now what?
- Now what what?

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:00.792
You gonna kick me out of school?

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.835
Nah.
Your friends?

01:13:03.003 --> 01:13:06.172
They took the heat for you.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.051
Anyway, you know what?

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.095
You'Ve been kicked out
of too many schools.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.348
So I told
the new headmaster that...

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:17.892
Whoa, hang on. What do you mean
new headmaster?

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.936
Oh yeah.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:22.397
I resigned this morning.

01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:28.569
The new headmaster is English.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:33.241
I hear he wears bow ties.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.328
So,

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:38.996
if you do stay here,

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:40.706
your scholarship is safe.

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:43.376
Look, man, thank you, but...

01:13:48.048 --> 01:13:49.966
I have absolutely no interest

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:52.385
in staying here,

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:56.681
I mean without you
or my friends, so...

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.975
I figured as much.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:10.862
You know what?
You're gonna be all right.

01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:13.990
- I don't know about that.
- No, you're gonna be all right.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.033
I know.

01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:18.077
Really.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:26.043
So what are you gonna do
about your family?

01:14:27.379 --> 01:14:29.046
Well...

01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:32.842
that family...
My family's had problems

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.344
for a long time
way before you came.

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:38.806
And Judy and I, well,

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.892
we were done years ago.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.729
Shawn.

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:47.023
He's a troubled kid.

01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:51.068
I feel responsible
for all that trouble he has.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.157
But that's the gift
a father gives a son...

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:59.577
Resentment and scorn.

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.455
He'll be all right.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:05.082
He'll come around
like when he's 29.

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:09.420
And that little girl of mine?

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:12.340
I don't worry about her one bit.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.468
She has got it all, man.

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:18.804
Got it all, that girl.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.608
- So what about you?
- Me?

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.613
Well, me...

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:37.865
Can I ask you a question?

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.534
Yeah.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.118
Seriously.

01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:43.496
You think I'm too old
to go back on the road?

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:46.040
Nah.
Just wrap it up.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.334
Oh, I'm gonna
double-bag it.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:51.754
Oh yeah. I ain't
making that mistake again.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:55.007
Hey, do a bro a solid, will you?

01:15:55.175 --> 01:15:56.259
Yeah, man.

01:15:56.426 --> 01:16:00.304
You take JetBlue
out of Ontario home tonight?

01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:04.809
Okay.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.727
Good.

01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:09.021
All right.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:10.982
Remember...

01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:14.235
heroes aren't born,

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.404
they're cornered.

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:20.783
- Bukowski?
- Mickey Rooney.

01:16:22.869 --> 01:16:24.537
Come on, get out of here.

01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:39.927
Oh.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:43.222
That's good.

01:16:44.474 --> 01:16:47.018

Hi.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:12.585
- Hey, you need some help?
- Sam?

01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:21.135
Worst opening line eVer.

01:17:26.224 --> 01:17:29.560
So what are you doing
taking my flight home?

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:32.229
Your flight, huh?

01:17:32.397 --> 01:17:35.107
Well, if you must know,
I'm going to be living

01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:37.610
with my dad's parents
in The Village

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:39.528
for the last year
and a half of high school.

01:17:39.696 --> 01:17:42.198
I hear they're eccentric
artists, so that's cool.

01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:44.408
That's cool.

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:48.204
You really don't haVe
to help me with that. It's fine.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:51.540
Look, yes I do.

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:54.752
By the way, how the hell do you plan
on getting all these bags past security?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.631
- I'm crafty.
- Crafty?

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:00.800
If you'd like to ensure
safe passage of your bags,

01:18:00.967 --> 01:18:02.134
then maybe you should
let me take one.

01:18:02.302 --> 01:18:03.552
We can just say we're together.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.221
Okay.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.390
It's cool.
It's my bag.

01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:11.435
Yeah, maybe, you know.

01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:14.438
Okay.

01:18:14.606 --> 01:18:16.315
- Okay.
- Maybe's okay.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.990
Thanks.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:31.789
