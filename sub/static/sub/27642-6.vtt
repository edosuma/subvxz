Hi, Kodi.
I'm Kodi Lee!

01:16:03.321 --> 01:16:05.688

01:16:07.821 --> 01:16:10.287

Hi, Tina.

So what are you gonna
do here for us today?

Tina, tell us
a little bit about Kodi.

01:16:39.154 --> 01:16:42.020
Kodi is blind and autistic.

01:16:42.021 --> 01:16:43.453
Oh.
Wow.

01:16:43.454 --> 01:16:46.187
We found out that
he loved music really early on.

01:16:46.188 --> 01:16:49.287
He listened
and his eyes just went huge.

01:16:49.288 --> 01:16:51.587
And he started singing.

01:16:51.588 --> 01:16:54.120
And that's when I just--
I was in tears,

01:16:54.121 --> 01:16:55.687
'cause that's when I realized,

01:16:55.688 --> 01:16:57.687
oh, my gosh,
he's an entertainer.

01:16:57.688 --> 01:17:00.153
So...
Yeah.

01:17:00.154 --> 01:17:02.420
Through
music and performing,

01:17:02.421 --> 01:17:05.853
he was able to withstand
living in this world,

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:08.453
because when you're autistic,
it's really hard

01:17:08.454 --> 01:17:10.453
to do what everybody else does.

01:17:10.454 --> 01:17:14.020
It actually has saved his life,
playing music.

01:17:14.021 --> 01:17:16.320
Wow.
Aw, that's awesome.
