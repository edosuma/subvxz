WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.960
She tried

00:04.520 --> 00:06.840
to hang herself, Jim.

00:06.920 --> 00:09.160
Because of what you did.
Because of Jack.

00:09.440 --> 00:14.760
There is no way that our little wee family
can ever be together again after this.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.240
- Why not ? - Because Anna
was the one who shot you.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.000
I'm Sarah. Sarah Nickel.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.200
This is my daughter, Rosa.
We found her.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.320
Help !

00:23.640 --> 00:25.680
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.240
I left him there to die.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.600
For Anna.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.080
He's a monster.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.600
I trusted you. I hid evidence for you !

00:33.920 --> 00:35.920
- That's good police work, that is.
- Not where I come from !

00:36.000 --> 00:37.160
You did this.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.560
You set him off.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.200
Where's my family ?

00:43.280 --> 00:44.400
What have I done ?

00:47.680 --> 00:49.120
Here ! Let's go !

00:55.800 --> 00:57.200
She wants you dead.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.720
So do I.

01:42.679 --> 01:43.879
Hi.

01:43.959 --> 01:46.439
- Coming from anywhere besides US ?
- Mexico.

01:47.799 --> 01:50.119
- Purpose of your visit ?
- Family.

01:50.199 --> 01:51.359
You have family in Mexico ?

01:51.439 --> 01:55.199
My mother was Canadian
but I was born in Chihuahua.

01:55.279 --> 01:57.559
Lotta driving.

01:58.199 --> 02:00.439
Why the back and forth ?

02:00.919 --> 02:03.199
I'm a preacher.

02:03.959 --> 02:06.679
- Any food, plants or animals ?
- No.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.119
- Anything over eight hundred dollars ?
- No.

02:11.359 --> 02:14.959
- Mind if I check ?
- Sure.

02:15.039 --> 02:17.719
Would you get out and open
the back for me, please ?

03:22.799 --> 03:24.719
Okay. You're good to go.
Welcome home, father.

03:24.799 --> 03:26.799
Thank you.

04:02.719 --> 04:07.079
TIN STAR

04:23.279 --> 04:25.039
Denise !

04:27.799 --> 04:30.519
- Does he know I'm here ?
- No.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.479
I know you're out there !

04:37.839 --> 04:40.719
Do you want me to go by the colony,
pick up Anna ?

04:40.799 --> 04:43.079
Being picked up by the police ?
She'd hate that.

04:43.519 --> 04:45.239
Angela, what do you want me to do ?

04:47.639 --> 04:49.599
Just don't let him out.

04:49.679 --> 04:52.599
If he agrees to go to rehab,
law says I have to.

04:52.679 --> 04:56.519
Rehab ? Are we talking
about the same man here ?

05:05.119 --> 05:07.759
- What did she say ?
- What did who say ?

05:10.439 --> 05:13.759
Don't fuck about Angela.
Does she know where Anna is ?

05:13.839 --> 05:15.799
No.

05:18.039 --> 05:19.679
- You going to let me out ?
- If you agree to go to rehab.

05:19.759 --> 05:22.599
- What are my options ?
- Federal prison pending trial.

05:22.679 --> 05:25.559
- I'll take prison.
- You heard the man, Denise.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.199
You'd rather go to jail
than get sober ?

05:29.399 --> 05:33.679
- I am sober.
- Keep your hands where I can see them.

05:46.399 --> 05:49.239
- Is it the puberty thing ?
- It's a moustache.

05:49.439 --> 05:53.319
Is it ? You want me clean, right ?

05:54.399 --> 05:56.879
- Yes !
- Let me out of here, to find Anna.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.879
- Will you go to a meeting ?
- Absolutely not.

05:59.119 --> 06:02.839
Name's Jim. Alcoholic. Addict.

06:03.199 --> 06:05.159
- Hello, Jim.
- Alright.

06:06.199 --> 06:10.959
Got forty-four hours in,
forty-four hours sober.

06:12.199 --> 06:14.799
Got nothing else to say really.
Except that I think

06:14.879 --> 06:17.519
that this is a load of bollocks
and you lot look like you are...

06:17.599 --> 06:19.679
- Thank you, Jim.
- Genetically challenged...

06:19.759 --> 06:23.399
- No offense. Can I go now ?
- No.

06:26.279 --> 06:29.839
- Is this a closed meeting ?
- Yes.

06:29.919 --> 06:33.919
If this is a closed meeting...
I mean no-one's going to be able

06:33.999 --> 06:38.799
to share honestly with fucking
uniform in the room, I mean really.

06:38.879 --> 06:41.079
I'm right. Am I right ? Right ?

06:48.159 --> 06:50.919
I'm going to be waiting
in the hallway.

07:09.919 --> 07:11.759
Hey !

07:13.959 --> 07:16.239
Son of a bitch !

08:22.199 --> 08:26.039
Hey. It's good to see you.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.079
Have you been a good man ?

08:30.159 --> 08:31.359
Good.

08:33.759 --> 08:34.919
Easy...

08:36.679 --> 08:38.558
There we are, Mrs. Fadenrecht.

08:38.639 --> 08:41.839
That should be nice and numb
in a few minutes.

08:52.079 --> 08:54.639
For heaven's sake, don't try
and whistle, Mrs. Fadenrecht.

08:56.759 --> 09:00.959
My wife will be with you in a moment,
Mrs. Fadenrecht !

09:06.119 --> 09:08.399
How are you ?

09:09.079 --> 09:12.159
Surviving the cold, barely.

09:12.879 --> 09:17.359
Johan, everyone keeps
asking questions.

09:17.439 --> 09:21.399
When will the pastor be back ?
Where is your husband, Mrs. Nickel ?

09:21.479 --> 09:24.999
Especially Mr. Quiring.
He comes round several times a day.

09:25.639 --> 09:28.159
- He wants you.
- No !

09:28.239 --> 09:32.079
- I don't blame him.
- I have a rotten tooth to pull.

09:32.759 --> 09:34.719
Papa !

09:37.079 --> 09:39.079
Let me look at you.

09:40.039 --> 09:42.959
You're a beauty.
Isn't she a beauty, Mamacita ?

09:43.039 --> 09:45.759
- And a handful.
- Did you stay out of trouble ?

09:45.839 --> 09:50.199
Course not, I'm your daughter.
Did you bring me a gift ?

09:50.279 --> 09:53.559
- New tack.
- Yes !

09:53.639 --> 09:56.519
And a Pinata for you, Thomas.
The border guards opened it

09:56.599 --> 09:59.599
so someone had better check
if they ate all the sweeties.

10:01.399 --> 10:03.959
Cup of coffee, Papa ?

10:04.839 --> 10:07.119
Slice of pie ?

10:09.879 --> 10:11.839
Why's everyone being so nice ?

10:13.119 --> 10:16.279
What were we supposed to do ?
Save her life then throw her out ?

10:16.839 --> 10:19.279
- What do the Elders say ?
- Stuff the Elders !

10:19.359 --> 10:21.439
I found her, I'm responsible for her.

10:21.519 --> 10:24.719
It's not like taking
in a stray dog, Rosa.

10:26.239 --> 10:28.399
Does Quiring know ?

10:30.159 --> 10:32.799
- Sarah !
- She's staying anyway.

10:32.879 --> 10:34.479
- I promised her.
- She can't.

10:34.559 --> 10:37.159
- If she goes, I go.
- Don't be such a teenager.

10:37.239 --> 10:38.799
Where does she get
this stubbornness from ?

10:38.879 --> 10:40.839
The Lord !

11:02.239 --> 11:05.119
- What's happened ?
- It's jammed.

11:05.199 --> 11:08.039
- What do you mean, its jammed ?
- I mean it won't pump.

11:09.119 --> 11:13.559
Come here to me.
Let me, go on get out.

11:22.239 --> 11:24.519
- It's jammed.
- Yep.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.799
Fuck it.

11:27.799 --> 11:31.519
Ammonites are good cooks, Anna.

11:31.599 --> 11:33.759
When we grow on,
we make everything ourselves.

11:33.839 --> 11:35.799
Careful that's hot.

11:35.879 --> 11:38.199
Bake our own breads
and cakes and pies.

11:38.439 --> 11:40.159
You've never even boiled an egg.

11:44.319 --> 11:47.879
- Does it still hurt, Anna ?
- I'm not that hungry, thank you.

11:47.959 --> 11:51.919
- Save space for Saskatoon pie, Anna.
- She's not hungry, Mama.

12:02.359 --> 12:04.959
Finish your supper, Anna.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.439
- Mr. Quiring.
- You're back, Pastor Nickel.

12:13.519 --> 12:16.999
- I am.
- Travel broadens the mind.

12:17.079 --> 12:20.439
- Can I help with anything ?
- Well...

12:20.719 --> 12:23.959
The pastor is in charge
of our spiritual welfare.

12:24.039 --> 12:25.599
- Yes ?
- You've been gone a week.

12:25.679 --> 12:28.479
- Six days.
- Without my permission.

12:29.359 --> 12:31.159
I need permission ?

12:31.239 --> 12:34.439
We don't want people
coming and going willy-nilly.

12:34.519 --> 12:37.719
Or what would become of the colony ?

12:40.239 --> 12:43.919
Perhaps the real leader is the man who
holds the purse strings, Mr. Quiring ?

12:45.079 --> 12:47.959
I hope my visits
to relatives back home,

12:48.759 --> 12:52.439
won't distract me from my duties
to Prairie Field.

12:52.519 --> 12:54.119
I hope not.

12:54.919 --> 12:56.439
Where are we going ?

12:56.519 --> 12:58.559
There's an old well
around here somewhere.

12:58.639 --> 13:02.879
Fuck that. Can't we just buy some
water ? I'm starting to stink.

13:06.199 --> 13:09.039
- No...
- What ?

13:09.759 --> 13:11.639
God...

13:13.119 --> 13:16.519
- How the hell did he get out of jail ?
- I warned you.

13:19.759 --> 13:22.439
- Maybe tell him we're in deep shit.
- What ?

13:22.519 --> 13:24.959
- Ask him for help !
- No fucking way.

13:33.559 --> 13:35.759
Do you mind ?

13:36.639 --> 13:39.519
Sorry, would you give us a moment ?

13:51.399 --> 13:56.079
So, did I kill her boyfriend ?
Cause if I killed her boyfriend,

13:57.079 --> 14:00.999
then he must have killed Pete,
so I'm off the hook right ?

14:02.079 --> 14:03.239
What ?

14:03.719 --> 14:07.319
He killed her brother,
he killed our son.

14:09.199 --> 14:11.559
- There's consequences.
- You're unbelievable.

14:11.639 --> 14:14.199
- Let's just bring her home.
- What the hell are you talking about ?

14:14.279 --> 14:17.399
We don't have a fucking home
and I'm not telling you where she is.

14:17.479 --> 14:19.599
She's with the God squad.

14:22.559 --> 14:24.639
I can't bear this anymore.

14:24.719 --> 14:27.519
This isn't a marriage.
This is a fucking suicide pact.

14:27.599 --> 14:31.439
If you go near Anna
and I will kill you.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.880
What do we tell everyone ?

14:50.880 --> 14:53.760
We tell them that Anna is my cousin.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.200
Twice removed.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.160
Which side ?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.800
On my mother's side.

15:05.880 --> 15:09.560
Which explains
her melancholy disposition.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.600
I didn't know you were
such a good liar, Johan.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.640
Alright ?

16:19.920 --> 16:22.040
Seen this girl ?

16:23.120 --> 16:25.200
Which girl ?

16:27.040 --> 16:29.000
This girl.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.680
I don't know.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.920
You alright ?

16:39.120 --> 16:43.120
- Never mind.
- May I help you officer ?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.920
Yes you may.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.400
Seen this girl ?

16:56.320 --> 17:00.280
- Weapons are forbidden here.
- I'm not going to shoot anyone yet.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.280
Seen this girl ?

17:06.200 --> 17:09.200
This is the girl we found in the barn.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.839
Which barn ?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.079
Who found her ?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.800
Which one of you is Sarah ?

17:28.640 --> 17:31.360
Seen this girl ? It's my daughter.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.880
Where is she ?

17:36.960 --> 17:41.040
- You do speak English, do you ?
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.520
Mama !

18:30.360 --> 18:32.440
What was that ?

18:47.600 --> 18:49.760
He's a cop !

18:50.440 --> 18:53.200
You won't tell him where I am,
will you ?

18:55.040 --> 18:58.680
In Chihuahua,
la chota were all criminals.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.160
Fuck the cops.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.320
Can I have your attention, please ?

19:07.440 --> 19:09.600
My daughter's run away from home.

19:10.800 --> 19:14.040
And I think she's hiding here.

19:14.560 --> 19:18.120
And me and her mum and I
are very worried. So...

19:19.080 --> 19:20.960
Anna, if you can hear me...

19:22.600 --> 19:25.520
We just want to help, love.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.440
We just want to do the right thing.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.400
If you can hear me,
why do you come out.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.560
- He won't find you up here.
- Yeah he will.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.640
- He's a police officer, Sarah.
- He's a madman, Johan.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.720
You want us to get in trouble
with the law ?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.160
Our law is the scripture.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.840
The scriptures
say nothing about this.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.840
Go out there and talk to him.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.800
Go.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.720
What do I say ?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.560
Be who they expect us to be, Johan.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.280
Act like an idiot.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.000
Fucking hell, beards compulsory
in this shit hole ?

20:56.400 --> 21:00.200
This is my daughter.
Have you seen her ?

21:03.120 --> 21:05.280
Your wife found her, apparently.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.920
Mind if I have a look about ?
Coming in.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.040
It's a bit grim, innit ?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.600
- Where's your daughter ?
- Don't know.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.200
- You got any other rooms ?
- No.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.480
What's up there ?

21:52.840 --> 21:54.880
Junk.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.080
Got a torch ?

22:15.800 --> 22:17.920
You're hiding something.

22:18.320 --> 22:23.240
Now, I want my daughter back,
with us, where she's safe.

22:23.320 --> 22:27.000
Now I don't know what you got going
on here but it fucking stinks.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.720
And I've been a cop for thirty years
and I can smell it.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.560
I'll be around.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.200
Fuck ! What the fuck !

25:50.360 --> 25:53.800
- Alright, Danny ?
- What the fuck ?

25:56.760 --> 26:00.080
- What the fuck you doing in here ?
- I live here !

26:01.320 --> 26:03.200
They let you out of jail then ?

26:03.280 --> 26:06.160
- I had nothing to do with your son.
- No I know.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.040
- They had to drop the charges.
- I know, Danny.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.680
- I swear to God...
- Danny, it's alright, I believe you.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.880
- Alright...
- Alright.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.320
This is your trailer then ?

26:19.600 --> 26:22.200
Fucking hell.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.320
Jesus.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.000
You got some money man ?

26:48.720 --> 26:53.200
Fuck it. Here you are,
get yourself a taxi,

26:53.720 --> 26:57.360
you get to the nearest bar, alright ?

26:57.440 --> 26:59.160
Here you are.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.560
Stay warm.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.640
- Is she okay ?
- She's fine.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.920
She's safe. She's with us.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.320
- It's just that...
- What ?

27:38.760 --> 27:43.040
Your husband won't leave the colony
until his daughter is turned over.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.360
- You won't, will you ?
- Certainly not.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.560
I promise.

27:53.960 --> 27:57.800
Tell me, is he a very wicked man ?

27:59.800 --> 28:01.760
No.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.320
Only when he drinks.

28:12.800 --> 28:18.000
I felt safe here.
For the first time in my life.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.840
Safety is not a place, Anna.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.480
It's a feeling.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.480
Of trust.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.480
I trust you.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.720
People make mistakes, Anna.
We all do.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.920
Which is why I...

28:43.000 --> 28:47.800
I put my trust, my life in the hands
of my heavenly Father.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.280
What if I don't believe ?

28:55.960 --> 28:59.920
Faith is like a seed.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.880
It takes time.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.920
Nourish it and it will grow.

29:15.200 --> 29:19.240
- That's a big decision, Anna.
- I know.

29:19.320 --> 29:24.120
To be baptized means to live
a new life. For Christ.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.600
I want to put my trust in something.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.360
Once you're baptized,

29:33.240 --> 29:34.880
you cannot go back
to your old way of life.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.800
- I don't want to go back.
- How can you be sure ?

29:37.880 --> 29:40.320
I hate my old life.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.080
Anna.

29:44.880 --> 29:49.320
We only baptize you when you
recognize the Lord in your heart.

29:50.920 --> 29:55.840
For some, that comes late.
Even Rosa isn't baptized yet.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.320
And besides,

29:58.400 --> 30:01.880
what if life here is not
as perfect as you think it is ?

30:03.640 --> 30:07.640
What happens when you discover
that we all have...

30:09.840 --> 30:11.680
Flaws ?

30:15.120 --> 30:17.360
At least you're not a criminal.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.880
You're afraid, aren't you ?

30:44.840 --> 30:47.120
I won't let him hurt us.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.040
It's not him I'm afraid of, Anna.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.880
Who then ?

31:31.840 --> 31:34.000
You alright ?

31:36.120 --> 31:39.040
Need a hand ?

31:39.120 --> 31:40.800
Here ?

31:45.000 --> 31:49.560
Up you get. Here.
I won't hurt you.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.600
Nice.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.280
Very nice.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.520
He wants to see Anna. Don't you ?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.480
Give him to me.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.800
You got one of mine,
I've got one of yours.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.520
I said give him to me !

32:27.560 --> 32:31.440
- Give him to me.
- There she is.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.040
Go on.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.720
This way.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.960
- Rosa.
- Please.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.880
Please just leave me alone.
I'm happy here.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.240
- Come.
- Leave.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.640
Would you mind fucking off
for a minute ?

32:57.720 --> 32:59.680
Don't speak to him like that !
This is his home.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.800
If anyone should be fucking off
it's you.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.800
She shot me. Really !

33:10.520 --> 33:16.120
I mean I only bring it up cause I think
you should take it into consideration.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.920
- Runs in the family.
- I am nothing like you.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.480
- Yeah you are.
- I'm not.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.960
You live like a fucking animal.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.960
I do not, I live in a fine upstanding
Christian community.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.160
I'm thinking of growing a beard.
Hello.

33:29.280 --> 33:33.280
You think you're brave because
you carry a gun. But you're not.

33:38.520 --> 33:42.120
- I am your dad though.
- You're a coward...

33:43.560 --> 33:45.440
- Yeah well I'm still your dad.
- And a liar...

33:45.520 --> 33:47.800
- I'm your dad though right ?
- And a cheat...

33:47.880 --> 33:50.120
- But also your dad.
- You're a murderer.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.960
But I am your dad though right ?

33:58.640 --> 33:59.840
Told you.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.760
You alright ?

34:12.880 --> 34:15.679
Give her back or I will kill you.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.440
Are you okay ?

34:52.080 --> 34:54.080
She has to go.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.480
Where ?

35:00.080 --> 35:04.040
To her father.
You heard what I said ?

35:05.400 --> 35:07.960
What about what Anna wants ?

35:12.560 --> 35:17.120
I promised her mother to keep her
until she was ready to go.

35:19.480 --> 35:22.720
In the meantime, neither you,
nor I, nor anyone else

35:22.800 --> 35:26.520
has the right to turn that girl away
if she wishes to stay.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.560
Johan, promise me
you won't send her back.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.960
Jesus, I stink.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.840
Where is this fucking thing ?

35:59.920 --> 36:02.560
The plans say it's on the far side
of the property.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.680
Is that it ?

36:08.680 --> 36:10.920
Yeah.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.240
Quickly !

36:41.040 --> 36:42.840
Anna ?

36:58.960 --> 37:01.280
The girl's father is a threat
to the peace of the colony.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.880
She must be found. Tonight.

37:03.960 --> 37:08.320
We should have turned her over
as soon as we could, Johan.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.880
Heroine ?

37:46.600 --> 37:48.600
God knows.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.360
- Hello ?
- Angela ?

39:05.640 --> 39:07.440
Anna.

39:11.360 --> 39:14.920
- Come with me, Anna.
- Where are you taking me ?

39:17.560 --> 39:20.200
- I'm taking you back, Anna.
- No you're not.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.000
- Don't make me drag you.
- I trusted you !

39:25.720 --> 39:29.720
- I'm just a man, Anna.
- No.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.760
You're a liar.

39:35.360 --> 39:39.280
You told me you believed in something.
Was that all shit ?

40:05.400 --> 40:09.120
- Turn the other cheek, child.
- What ?

40:11.160 --> 40:13.360
Turn away from me !

40:15.840 --> 40:19.400
- I don't understand.
- Turn away from me !

40:38.160 --> 40:41.800
Turn your thoughts to the Divine.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.160
Put your faith in our Father.

40:46.840 --> 40:50.800
Know that I am a child of God,
though I have sinned.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.440
Pray for the Christ in me !

40:54.520 --> 40:57.040
- Pray !
- I don't know how !

41:06.040 --> 41:08.120
Look at me.

41:08.360 --> 41:12.280
I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,

41:12.360 --> 41:15.920
Maker of Heaven and earth.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.080
I believe in God the Father Almighty,

41:20.160 --> 41:22.560
Maker of Heaven and earth.

41:22.640 --> 41:27.760
And in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord.

41:27.840 --> 41:31.880
I believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord...

41:31.960 --> 41:34.360
Who was conceived
by the Holy Spirit,

41:34.440 --> 41:36.840
born of the virgin Mary,

41:36.920 --> 41:40.880
as crucified, died
and descended into Hell.

41:41.640 --> 41:46.120
Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,
born of the virgin Mary,

41:46.880 --> 41:51.400
was crucified, died,
and descended into Hell.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.480
- Where is she ?
- I tried to stop them !

41:57.560 --> 41:58.960
He ascended into Heaven

41:59.040 --> 42:02.240
and sits at the right hand
of God the Father Almighty.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.840
He ascended into Heaven

42:03.920 --> 42:08.120
and sits at the right hand
of God the Father Almighty.

42:09.480 --> 42:14.960
I believe in the Holly Spirit,
the one holy Christian church...

42:15.040 --> 42:19.680
The fellowship of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins.

42:20.600 --> 42:25.720
I believe in the Holly Spirit,
the one holy Christian church,

42:26.360 --> 42:30.960
and the fellowship of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.480
And the resurrection of the body

42:35.560 --> 42:38.280
and in life everlasting.

42:38.360 --> 42:42.360
In the resurrection of the body
and in life everlasting.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.920
Jim !

43:00.360 --> 43:03.160
- Who's that ?
- That's Jesus.

43:03.640 --> 43:07.360
- What's he doing with our daughter ?
- I don't fucking know.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.360
I baptize you in the name
of the Father...

43:15.440 --> 43:17.640
And of the Son...

43:19.200 --> 43:21.120
And of the Holy Spirit.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.360
- Don't you fucking touch her !
- Jim ! Stop.

43:30.760 --> 43:33.440
We're the reason she's doing this !

43:34.200 --> 43:36.880
Let's leave her alone.

44:01.080 --> 44:03.400
Whiskey.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.640
Double.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.920
Bar's closed.

45:31.320 --> 45:33.960
Scripture

45:35.560 --> 45:37.920
is truth

45:38.960 --> 45:41.240
and prophesy.

45:42.400 --> 45:46.880
Christ's Jesus teaches tells us
not just how to live

45:46.960 --> 45:50.040
but what happens to when
we do not live by it.

45:52.520 --> 45:56.720
After twenty centuries,
the prophesy has been fulfilled.

45:59.520 --> 46:05.520
Today men think that the only way
to settle a conflict is by force.

46:09.320 --> 46:12.040
But there is another way.

46:15.600 --> 46:19.360
Christ Jesus teaches that
when someone who means you harm

46:20.080 --> 46:25.040
comes into your home,
your school or your life,

46:28.520 --> 46:33.440
turn your cheek, your head, your
thoughts away from the aggressor.

46:38.080 --> 46:41.360
Resist not evil.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.840
That is the true revenge.

46:50.520 --> 46:55.840
The realization of the presence
of God's love in all his creatures

46:57.640 --> 46:59.360
restores peace.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.960
Alright.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.200
Nice hat.
