00:00.328 --> 00:02.562
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:02.597 --> 00:04.331
Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:04.365 --> 00:06.266
Aww.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.902
You guys! You shouldn't have.

00:08.936 --> 00:10.904
This is so cute!

00:10.938 --> 00:12.906
Oh, wait, there's something else.

00:14.308 --> 00:16.109
Aww.

00:16.143 --> 00:19.413
It's a "My First Helmet."

00:19.447 --> 00:21.248
Here, open mine next!

00:24.219 --> 00:25.519
It's teething puck.

00:25.553 --> 00:27.454
Builds strong teeth

00:27.488 --> 00:29.590
to be knocked out
later when baby go pro.

00:30.396 --> 00:32.893
Knock, knock, girls on the floor.

00:36.431 --> 00:38.148
- Hi.
- Hey, there's my baby mama,

00:38.248 --> 00:40.185
my pregnant gal pal,

00:40.285 --> 00:42.687
my beautiful baby lady.

00:42.721 --> 00:45.556
Oh, you're terrible at
whatever you're trying to do.

00:46.592 --> 00:48.092
Well, I'd like to call you my wife.

00:48.127 --> 00:50.346
Well, I'd like to eat
sushi and drink booze,

00:50.446 --> 00:52.396
but if I have to wait until
after the baby, so do you.

00:52.496 --> 00:54.530
Got it. So you two
spending the day together?

00:54.565 --> 00:57.667
Yup, we sure are. Part
of my mommy boot camp.

00:57.701 --> 01:00.503
I'm spending as much spare
time as possible with Emma

01:00.537 --> 01:02.839
to get practice for
taking care of our baby.

01:02.873 --> 01:05.241
That's great, hon,
but do you really think

01:05.275 --> 01:07.110
bringing her to a room
full of half-naked men

01:07.144 --> 01:08.978
is a good idea?

01:10.314 --> 01:11.881
That's my first lesson.

01:11.915 --> 01:14.083
See? This is why I'm practicing.

01:26.263 --> 01:28.198
Thank you, man. Hey, Ben!

01:28.298 --> 01:29.832
I'm taking money from your wallet

01:29.866 --> 01:31.667
because you owe me for every pizza

01:31.701 --> 01:33.235
we've ever ordered...

01:33.270 --> 01:34.570
ever.

01:37.274 --> 01:38.974
Well, excuse me.

01:39.009 --> 01:40.309
What do we have here?

01:40.343 --> 01:43.145
- Nothing.
- This is Elle, isn't it?

01:43.179 --> 01:45.147
- No!
- Dude, I cannot believe

01:45.181 --> 01:47.182
you are still carrying
around a picture of a girl

01:47.217 --> 01:48.803
- you don't even know.
- So?

01:48.903 --> 01:50.703
You carry around all those
fortune cookie fortunes

01:50.738 --> 01:51.804
in your wallet.

01:52.773 --> 01:54.974
Sometimes I go through your wallet.

01:55.009 --> 01:56.776
I know it's weird, man.

01:56.810 --> 01:58.144
I just like to look at her picture

01:58.179 --> 02:00.213
- and think, "What if?"
- Look, man.

02:00.247 --> 02:02.315
I understand what-ifs. Right?

02:02.349 --> 02:04.584
What if Ben paid his rent on time?

02:04.618 --> 02:06.786
What if Ben stopped
drinking all my beers?

02:06.820 --> 02:09.122
Do you notice a central
theme to my what-ifs?

02:09.156 --> 02:13.760
No! I mean, what if
she's looking for me too?

02:13.794 --> 02:16.896
Look, I'm sorry, dude, but
you're never gonna find her.

02:16.931 --> 02:19.299
Yeah, you're probably right.

02:20.401 --> 02:21.735
I just wish you weren't.

02:23.237 --> 02:25.472
I really liked that apartment,

02:25.506 --> 02:28.546
except for the bathroom and the kitchen,

02:28.646 --> 02:30.714
and the bedroom was really small.

02:30.748 --> 02:32.215
Okay, I didn't like it.

02:33.184 --> 02:34.451
I'm really sorry.

02:34.485 --> 02:36.586
You know, Elizabeth, I like you.

02:36.621 --> 02:38.521
I like you too, but the only person

02:38.556 --> 02:40.257
who calls me Elizabeth is my mom.

02:40.291 --> 02:41.558
No, problem. How about I call you Liz?

02:41.592 --> 02:43.493
- I wish you wouldn't.
- Like I was saying, Liz,

02:43.527 --> 02:45.462
I like you.

02:45.496 --> 02:47.797
You know, you're just...
you're so together.

02:47.832 --> 02:49.799
Maybe I can set you up with my son.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.601
Oh! No! Damn it!

02:51.636 --> 02:53.903
He just knocked up the love of his life,

02:53.938 --> 02:56.206
so I guess technically
he's off the market.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.142
Although, never say never
until the baby comes out

02:59.176 --> 03:00.744
looking like him. Am I right? Huh?

03:00.778 --> 03:02.746
Liz? Liz?

03:02.780 --> 03:05.782
I'm fine. I kind of have a guy.

03:05.816 --> 03:08.032
- Oh.
- Well, I don't really know him yet,

03:08.132 --> 03:09.833
but I know that he's the one.

03:09.867 --> 03:11.602
I just have to find him again.

03:11.636 --> 03:14.805
God, you sound like my stupid son Ben.

03:14.839 --> 03:17.075
Oh my God, I forgot. I
have a stupid son Ben.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.066
How about I set you up with him?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.868
You're not really selling him that well.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.737
Honey, when I see two people
out there looking for love,

03:24.772 --> 03:27.440
who are too pathetic
to find it on their own,

03:27.475 --> 03:29.709
I just can't help but put them together.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.779
It's settled. I am setting you up.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.765
Just another bonus of being my client.

03:34.865 --> 03:36.166
Wait, what was the first bonus?

03:36.200 --> 03:38.068
Ohh! Shh. Don't over think it, Liz.

03:40.371 --> 03:41.624
Thank you, Mr. Squirrel.

03:41.724 --> 03:44.225
You've helped Princess
Victoria save the day.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.502
So does this Princess Victoria chick

03:46.602 --> 03:48.136
have an actual job?

03:48.170 --> 03:49.571
I mean, what does she do all day?

03:49.605 --> 03:53.908
Um, she saves woodland
creatures with pixie glitter,

03:53.943 --> 03:56.306
and she also happens to
be an excellent speller.

03:56.406 --> 03:58.040
What do you contribute to society?

03:58.075 --> 04:01.110
Whoa, back off, fan boy.

04:01.144 --> 04:03.179
I mean, I get why Emma likes the show,

04:03.213 --> 04:04.413
but what's your deal?

04:08.118 --> 04:11.087
She likes the bunny,
and I like the honey.

04:12.523 --> 04:14.023
Hi, babe, look.

04:14.058 --> 04:16.091
Emma and I are watching
her favorite show together,

04:16.125 --> 04:17.961
Princess Victoria.

04:17.995 --> 04:20.697
Tucker's just a creepy fan.

04:20.731 --> 04:23.060
I seriously can't get
away from that woman.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.428
She's invading Madison
Square Garden this weekend...

04:25.462 --> 04:28.030
some big ice show for charity

04:28.065 --> 04:29.799
that all the Rangers
have to take part in.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.535
Oh, as a good mother-to-be,
I should take Emma.

04:32.569 --> 04:34.570
It sounds heinous, but I'm in.

04:34.604 --> 04:37.076
Ah, no. No, no, no.
I... I will take Emma,

04:37.176 --> 04:39.811
because we have a very special bond

04:39.846 --> 04:41.714
with Princess Victoria
that nobody can break.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.118
Dude, if you like her that much,

04:43.218 --> 04:44.751
I can probably get you in the show.

04:44.786 --> 04:47.054
Sorry, kid, you're on your own.

04:47.088 --> 04:49.021
Half my teammates have
already dropped out.

04:49.121 --> 04:51.523
Trust me, put on a
helmet, no one will care.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.626
Ha ha! And it looks like this fairy tale

04:54.660 --> 04:57.662
is gonna end with me
getting some fairy tail.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.074

05:06.005 --> 05:07.973
So, Benji, I was thinking.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.374
No.

05:09.408 --> 05:11.743
But I want to set you
up with my new client.

05:11.777 --> 05:14.012
Ooh, someone my mom likes?

05:14.046 --> 05:15.647
And we're back to no.

05:15.681 --> 05:18.283
- She's nice.
- Which is code for ugly.

05:18.317 --> 05:21.253
- She's smart.
- Which is code for super ugly.

05:21.287 --> 05:24.987
Ben, you know I don't
like you very much...

05:25.843 --> 05:27.710
but, you know, I just can't stand by

05:27.745 --> 05:29.512
and watch you throw your life away

05:29.547 --> 05:32.115
over some mystery woman
that you haven't even met

05:32.149 --> 05:34.350
when my mom-tuition is telling me

05:34.385 --> 05:36.920
that this girl is perfect for you.

05:36.954 --> 05:39.956
Well, I don't know
about perfect, but I try.

05:39.990 --> 05:42.692
Sam. Oh my god, hi.

05:42.726 --> 05:45.128
Wow, Sam, I never
thought I'd see you again.

05:45.162 --> 05:46.596
Mom, look, it's Sam.

05:46.630 --> 05:48.331
Aww, hey, Sam.

05:48.365 --> 05:50.680
Sorry, I don't have any more
kids for you to sleep with.

05:52.403 --> 05:54.805
I didn't want to bother
you, but I found this hat

05:54.839 --> 05:57.574
in my apartment and I
thought it might be yours.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.043
Hmm, nope, not mine. Sorry.

06:00.078 --> 06:02.712
Oh, okay, are you sure?

06:02.747 --> 06:04.714
Oh good God, Ben,

06:04.749 --> 06:07.581
if you were any slower, we could
cut in line at amusement parks.

06:07.852 --> 06:10.220
This is just some
lame excuse to see you.

06:10.255 --> 06:13.657
- Is that true?
- Well, it's not not true.

06:13.692 --> 06:15.819
Well, you know what,
Sam? You're too late

06:15.919 --> 06:18.187
because he is about to
start dating this hottie.

06:18.222 --> 06:19.597
Mom! Those are your boobs!

06:19.697 --> 06:22.633
Oh, I'm sorry, that was for Brad.

06:23.568 --> 06:25.435
Are you really here just to see me?

06:25.470 --> 06:27.437
I missed you.

06:27.472 --> 06:29.305
I keep feeling like I made a mistake,

06:29.405 --> 06:31.707
and I was kind of hoping
for another chance.

06:33.443 --> 06:33.990
Ben?

06:34.016 --> 06:36.178
Sorry, I'm just not
used to women coming back

06:36.212 --> 06:37.913
without me doing a lot of begging.

06:37.947 --> 06:42.050
So what about all the stuff you
said about us and about Emma?

06:42.085 --> 06:44.786
I know, I'm sorry. It was
just too much too soon,

06:44.821 --> 06:46.245
and I kind of panicked,

06:46.345 --> 06:48.613
but it sounds like you might
be seeing someone right now.

06:48.648 --> 06:50.415
No, no, no, I'm totally single.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.417
No, he's not. He's dating this.

06:54.821 --> 06:57.589
Oh, god, I'm sorry. That's Brad.

06:57.623 --> 06:59.758
We took pictures of every body part

06:59.792 --> 07:01.193
before he went away to prison.

07:01.227 --> 07:03.261
This one's my favorite.

07:03.296 --> 07:06.531
Waa. Yeah.

07:08.301 --> 07:09.568
Man, I hope I get to be the prince.

07:09.602 --> 07:10.869
Do you think I'll get to be the prince?

07:10.904 --> 07:13.305
Because, you know, princesses
only date princes, right?

07:13.339 --> 07:15.774
It's a royal decree from King Possum.

07:15.809 --> 07:18.210
All right, calm down.

07:18.244 --> 07:19.812
No one else wants to be the prince.

07:19.846 --> 07:21.380
I want to be prince.

07:21.414 --> 07:23.115
I love Princess Victoria.

07:23.149 --> 07:25.084
Her show is how I learn English.

07:25.118 --> 07:27.949
And if you wish for
something, it will be so.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.359
Plus, she is total smoke show.

07:32.561 --> 07:34.629
Okay, boys, let's
finish up this casting.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.384
My mood elevators are on their way down.

07:36.465 --> 07:38.533
Hi, hi. I was a theater major,

07:38.567 --> 07:41.002
and I am all about the
integrity of the show.

07:41.037 --> 07:42.871
Right, I was hoping
I could be the prince.

07:42.905 --> 07:45.874
And I was hoping to have a conversation
like this with Dustin Hoffman,

07:45.908 --> 07:49.142
so we're both disappointed.
You can be the little spoon.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.406
Little spoon... Okay, now me.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.875
- I be prince, yes?
- You be prince, no.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.144
You be tree.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.047
You, tall, dark and
vacant-behind the eyes,

08:01.081 --> 08:03.063
- let's go with...
- Please don't say it.

08:03.163 --> 08:05.631
...the prince, and I think we're done.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.901
Come on, Danny, you
have to trade with me.

08:08.935 --> 08:10.769
- You don't even want to do this.
- But I'm your teammate,

08:10.804 --> 08:13.072
and you already have happy ever after.

08:13.106 --> 08:14.406
I want happy

08:14.441 --> 08:16.208
with girl even hotter than yours.

08:16.243 --> 08:18.611
Hey, did you just call
my girlfriend ugly?

08:18.645 --> 08:20.145
No, no, not ugly.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.147
Maybe a little bit round.

08:22.182 --> 08:25.918
She's pregnant! Here.

08:25.952 --> 08:27.545
I'm the prince! I'm the prince!

08:27.645 --> 08:29.412
I love you, Danny.

08:29.447 --> 08:30.814
Um, um, thank you, bro.

08:30.848 --> 08:32.849
Um, uh, yeah, we cool.
I'm gonna see you.

08:34.452 --> 08:36.253
You will regret this day.

08:38.456 --> 08:40.657
Now, with any luck, this
production of Princess Victoria

08:40.692 --> 08:42.893
and the Little Spoon won't
suck as hard as the last one.

08:42.927 --> 08:45.162
Now, where's the Little
Spoon, the star of our show?

08:50.202 --> 08:52.770
Wow, so much for taking things slow.

08:52.804 --> 08:55.039
Hey, we made it out of
the elevator, didn't we?

08:55.073 --> 08:57.241
I just hope our clothes
are still in there.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.030
This place is for rent?

09:04.130 --> 09:05.931
Does the person living here know that?

09:05.965 --> 09:08.400
Yeah, it's my son's place.

09:08.435 --> 09:11.170
Oh, wow, we're doing this now?

09:11.204 --> 09:12.938
I would have worn a different top.

09:12.972 --> 09:14.840
Well, lucky for you, my son's a guy,

09:14.874 --> 09:16.200
and they don't care what you wear,

09:16.300 --> 09:18.361
as long as you got what
they need underneath.

09:18.461 --> 09:20.629
All right, okay, you sit here.
I'm gonna go check his room.

09:24.870 --> 09:26.337
- Mom!
- Ben!

09:26.371 --> 09:27.672
- Mrs. Wheeler!
- Sam!

09:27.706 --> 09:29.073
Mom!

09:29.107 --> 09:31.209
You know what, just saying
each other's names out loud

09:31.243 --> 09:32.712
does not make this any more comfortable.

09:34.689 --> 09:36.690
- Mom, get out!
- Oh, please.

09:36.724 --> 09:38.858
There's nothing I haven't seen before.

09:38.893 --> 09:40.427
And that's my cue to leave.

09:40.461 --> 09:43.663
No, you can't go. Ben's
future wife is out there.

09:43.698 --> 09:45.131
I thought you said you were single!

09:45.166 --> 09:46.548
I'm trying not to be right now.

09:46.648 --> 09:48.115
Ooh, perfect, get your pants on.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.017
With Sam. I'm trying not
to be single with Sam.

09:50.051 --> 09:51.685
This would be incredibly sweet right now

09:51.720 --> 09:53.667
if I wasn't naked in front of you mom!

09:55.891 --> 09:59.160
- You.
- Yes, it's me.

09:59.194 --> 10:02.797
- And you're you.
- Hey, you,

10:02.831 --> 10:04.565
person I've never seen before.

10:04.599 --> 10:06.142
- Who are you exactly?
- Sorry.

10:06.242 --> 10:07.776
I'm just here with my realtor.

10:07.810 --> 10:09.711
At least I think she's a realtor.

10:09.746 --> 10:11.446
She's stolen something

10:11.481 --> 10:13.248
from every open house we've been to.

10:14.584 --> 10:16.451
Bonnie Wheeler? Yeah.

10:16.486 --> 10:17.536
I'll go get her for you.

10:17.636 --> 10:19.203
Here, will you watch my niece for me?

10:19.238 --> 10:20.972
- Hey.
- Thank you.

10:21.006 --> 10:21.808
Don't screw up.

10:21.908 --> 10:23.609
I'm practicing to be a good mom.

10:25.345 --> 10:26.779
Hey, Mrs. Wheel... whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:26.813 --> 10:28.915
Sam? Seriously, Ben?

10:28.949 --> 10:30.824
I know, right? It's like there's no

10:30.850 --> 10:32.752
one else in the world to sleep with,

10:32.786 --> 10:35.521
except there is and she's
sitting out there on that couch.

10:35.556 --> 10:37.089
Oh, is that girl here for Ben?

10:37.124 --> 10:38.991
- She seems really sweet.
- I know, right?

10:39.026 --> 10:40.500
See, I knew she was ugly.

10:40.594 --> 10:42.625
Now, I'm definitely not going out there.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.990
Uh, you were going to otherwise?

10:44.090 --> 10:46.291
No, no. Where's Emma?

10:46.326 --> 10:48.360
She's in the living room
with your mom's client.

10:48.394 --> 10:49.463
In other words, you left my daughter

10:49.563 --> 10:50.997
with a complete stranger?

10:51.031 --> 10:53.354
No, I would never do that.

10:53.454 --> 10:54.954
I got to go check on
something really quick.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.896
- Is this a new duvet?
- Get out!

11:05.909 --> 11:07.662
You know what? He's not here.

11:07.762 --> 11:09.930
- Let's go.
- But I heard yelling.

11:09.964 --> 11:11.999
Wow, aren't you a
nosy little thing, huh?

11:12.033 --> 11:14.301
Let's go, let's go, let's
go. Let's go, let's go.

11:19.412 --> 11:23.182
Have you read this? The
princess ends up with the spoon.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.699
What kind of fairy tale from hell

11:24.799 --> 11:26.533
does the handsome prince get passed up

11:26.568 --> 11:27.935
for cheap cutlery?

11:27.969 --> 11:30.671
Dude, I got to get that
spoon costume back from you.

11:30.705 --> 11:32.048
Oh, yeah, about that,

11:32.148 --> 11:33.982
I kind of already switched with someone.

11:35.018 --> 11:38.053
Thanks to teammate who
does not get context clues

11:38.088 --> 11:40.556
even in very obvious show title,

11:40.590 --> 11:44.326
I skate into sunrise
with Princess Victoria.

11:47.831 --> 11:49.601
I'm not sure what that meant,

11:49.701 --> 11:51.768
but I do not think he was thanking me.

11:52.238 --> 11:53.649
No, he was not.

11:53.749 --> 11:55.450
He was mocking you.

11:55.484 --> 11:57.886
Not quite sure what that means either,

11:57.920 --> 12:00.956
but he is so going down.

12:02.742 --> 12:05.010
So when I said I'd get a
drink with your son sometime,

12:05.044 --> 12:06.845
I didn't mean 9:00 A.M.

12:06.879 --> 12:08.613
Hey, it's noon somewhere.

12:08.648 --> 12:10.782
- You mean five o'clock?
- No, why?

12:13.352 --> 12:15.320
Oh, hey, you know what?

12:15.354 --> 12:16.822
Why don't you sit here,

12:16.856 --> 12:18.657
and I'll make sure that he's decent?

12:18.691 --> 12:20.616
And maybe fluff your hair up a little?

12:20.716 --> 12:22.650
You know, some effort wouldn't kill you.

12:25.654 --> 12:28.147
- Seriously?
- What is the matter with you?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.648
Stop mom-blocking me.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.817
Well, I am sorry, but you
have a paying customer outside

12:32.852 --> 12:34.653
who's very thirsty.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.289
Any chance this paying
customer is really just you?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.157
Grab a bottle and get out!

12:39.191 --> 12:42.727
Benjamin, can I speak to
you for a moment in private?

12:44.130 --> 12:46.776
Okay, look, I got Liz outside,

12:46.876 --> 12:48.744
and she is perfect for you.

12:48.778 --> 12:50.712
She loves kids, she loves me,

12:50.747 --> 12:52.647
and she didn't sleep with your brother.

12:52.682 --> 12:54.416
I can still hear you.

12:54.450 --> 12:56.702
Well, I told you. I'm seeing Sam.

12:56.802 --> 12:57.866
This is what I'm doing now.

12:57.966 --> 13:01.001
Fine, but do you have anyone
lined up for this afternoon?

13:01.036 --> 13:02.470
Because I could bring her back then.

13:02.504 --> 13:04.505
Again, can still hear you.

13:05.474 --> 13:06.604
Mom, I'm busy all day here,

13:06.704 --> 13:08.205
and then I'm going to
Danny's stupid ice show

13:08.239 --> 13:10.741
with Emma and Riley tonight. Come here.

13:10.775 --> 13:14.344
Look, everyone's been telling me
I'm wasting my time chasing Elle

13:14.379 --> 13:16.046
and I should get off of
her and on someone else.

13:16.081 --> 13:17.948
Well, I'm on someone else.

13:17.982 --> 13:19.378
I want to make a go at this with Sam.

13:19.478 --> 13:20.745
I think she's really changed.

13:20.779 --> 13:23.714
Look, honey, you don't need
somebody who's changing for you.

13:23.749 --> 13:25.883
You need somebody who
starts out right for you.

13:25.917 --> 13:28.252
And, look, I don't know
what it is about Liz,

13:28.286 --> 13:31.614
but I am telling you there is
something very special about her.

13:31.757 --> 13:34.957
Oh, and by the way, women don't change.

13:35.057 --> 13:37.892
We just spend all of our
lives trying to change you...

13:39.495 --> 13:41.096
and then we die.

13:45.568 --> 13:49.204
You know, I really enjoyed spending
time with you and Emma yesterday.

13:49.238 --> 13:51.423
Any chance I could tag along
with you guys to the ice show?

13:51.523 --> 13:52.957
We'd love to have you.

13:52.992 --> 13:54.137
I mean, I have to ask Emma first,

13:54.237 --> 13:56.171
but she pretty much
does whatever I tell her.

13:56.206 --> 13:57.317
It's awesome.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.442
I'm shocked. He wasn't here too.

14:00.477 --> 14:03.412
But good news, I found you an apartment

14:03.446 --> 14:06.181
and this one has an ice rink in it.

14:09.439 --> 14:11.273
Riley.

14:14.344 --> 14:17.246
I'm pregnant! I deserve two!

14:18.149 --> 14:19.849
She screams that at least once a day.

14:19.884 --> 14:21.417
You'll get used to it.

14:21.452 --> 14:23.720
All right, coming through.

14:23.754 --> 14:25.455
You want ass or crotch?

14:25.489 --> 14:27.724
Too late. Ass it is.

14:29.293 --> 14:31.783
Oh, crap! Crap! Um, you
know what? Wrong row, Liz.

14:31.883 --> 14:34.352
Let's just go. Move
it, move it, move it.

14:34.386 --> 14:37.822
Princess Victoria and the Little Spoon.

14:37.856 --> 14:39.957
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

14:39.992 --> 14:41.869
Hey, if Daddy closes his eyes,

14:41.969 --> 14:43.603
he's just listening to the music, okay?

14:47.151 --> 14:50.420
Okay, I need my cutlery
out on the ice right now.

14:50.454 --> 14:53.289
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

14:54.692 --> 14:57.154
See you on the ice,
losers. If you need me,

14:57.254 --> 14:59.388
I'll be in Princess Victoria's room.

14:59.423 --> 15:00.812
Be sure to knock first,

15:00.912 --> 15:03.246
because we will be having the sex.

15:06.484 --> 15:08.919
You know what? That's it. That's it.

15:08.953 --> 15:11.621
I am done playing
second fiddle to a spoon.

15:11.656 --> 15:13.924
Okay, what kind of crazy
world are we living in

15:13.958 --> 15:15.304
where the prince isn't the star?

15:15.493 --> 15:16.620
And who's ever heard of a show

15:16.720 --> 15:19.021
where the utensils get more
ice time than the people?

15:20.224 --> 15:22.859
- Beauty and the Beast. The Nutcracker.
- Okay.

15:22.893 --> 15:25.061
Shut up, man! I am making a point.

15:25.096 --> 15:27.764
Gentlemen, ice dancers,

15:27.798 --> 15:29.599
warriors,

15:29.634 --> 15:32.936
tonight we skate for children and fun...

15:34.272 --> 15:36.069
but do you know what else we skate for?

15:36.340 --> 15:38.008
Justice!

15:38.042 --> 15:39.943
Has no one looked around

15:39.977 --> 15:41.835
at the insanity that we are facing?

15:41.935 --> 15:46.171
I mean, come on! Here we are
chipmunks, townspeople, royalty,

15:46.206 --> 15:49.074
even trees... all living things...

15:49.108 --> 15:51.158
and who does the princess run off with?

15:51.258 --> 15:53.059
An inanimate utensil

15:53.093 --> 15:55.828
that is only useful
for breakfast cereal.

15:55.862 --> 15:57.530
- And soup.
- And soup!

15:57.564 --> 15:59.765
That is right, Danny, and soup.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.736
My people, as your prince, I ask you,

16:03.770 --> 16:06.520
do we let a flimsy piece of metal

16:06.620 --> 16:08.780
- conquer human beings?
- No! No way!

16:08.880 --> 16:10.854
Are we gonna be forked over by a spoon?

16:10.880 --> 16:11.348
No!

16:11.382 --> 16:14.084
I say enough is enough!

16:14.119 --> 16:16.487
Death to spoon-Princess love!

16:16.521 --> 16:19.857
- To the ice!
- Yeah!

16:25.330 --> 16:26.318
What's wrong? What's wrong?

16:26.418 --> 16:27.985
Why did you
text me 9-1-1?

16:28.020 --> 16:29.803
You stopped for food?

16:30.055 --> 16:33.157
Well, I'm pregnant. I deserve two.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.827
Okay, listen, look, I need your help.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.065
You need to get rid of Sam

16:37.165 --> 16:39.200
so I can set Ben up with my client Liz.

16:39.234 --> 16:41.302
Seriously, you're still on that?

16:41.336 --> 16:43.237
Ben and Sam seem happy together.

16:43.271 --> 16:44.645
I don't want to ruin a good thing.

16:44.706 --> 16:46.240
Plus, I really like her now.

16:46.275 --> 16:48.643
Hey, remember when Sam slept
with Danny in high school?

16:48.677 --> 16:50.278
I'm in. What do you need me to do?

16:53.081 --> 16:55.483
Oh, this is it, Emma.

16:55.517 --> 16:56.951
Oh, look, there's Princess Victoria.

16:56.985 --> 16:59.254
She's heading to the castle.

16:59.354 --> 17:00.551
Oh, and there's the little spoon

17:00.651 --> 17:02.385
and all the other magic utensils.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.921
You're witnessing the
hardest part of parenting,

17:04.955 --> 17:07.156
faking enthusiasm.

17:07.191 --> 17:10.426
Oh, oh, and there's
the woodland creatures,

17:10.461 --> 17:11.861
and the people,

17:11.896 --> 17:14.521
and the prince who
looks a lot like Tucker.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.404
I'm coming for you, Victoria!

17:21.973 --> 17:23.807
What is happening?

17:30.815 --> 17:32.416
It's her.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.151
Oh my god, is it?

17:34.185 --> 17:35.583
Yeah, it is.

17:35.683 --> 17:38.719
It really is her. Looks like
she's sitting on the other side.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.520
I should go. Should I go? I got to go!

17:40.555 --> 17:42.623
Excuse me? What are you doing?

17:42.657 --> 17:44.269
This is gonna sound completely insane,

17:44.369 --> 17:46.237
but I've been trying to
find that girl for months.

17:46.271 --> 17:47.991
Okay, you found her, now sit down.

17:48.007 --> 17:50.275
No, no, no, I just need like
two seconds to go meet her.

17:50.309 --> 17:52.310
Well, ten minutes tops.

17:52.344 --> 17:55.547
So you want to leave me
to meet some other girl?

17:55.581 --> 17:57.283
She isn't just a girl...

17:57.383 --> 17:59.551
a girl I saw three times in one day.

17:59.585 --> 18:01.452
It's like crazy fate.

18:01.487 --> 18:04.355
Well, you're about to
see me no times in no days

18:04.390 --> 18:06.224
if you don't just sit down.

18:07.826 --> 18:10.495
No, I can't. I'm
sorry. Sam, I got to go.

18:11.897 --> 18:13.476
This might be a bad time,
but can you watch Emma

18:13.576 --> 18:15.944
for just two sec... okay.

18:15.978 --> 18:18.446
Elle, it's me!

18:26.455 --> 18:28.923
Did Ben leave you here with
Emma? Here, let me take her.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.994
Did you do that on purpose?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.396
Yes, and I feel really
bad about it already.

18:35.431 --> 18:38.166
My hormones are all
over the place today.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.631
I knew it was a bad idea

18:39.731 --> 18:41.398
the second I walked into that bar.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.300
"Oh, Sam, why don't you
bring a hat into the bar

18:43.335 --> 18:45.162
and see if Ben's still
interested in you?"

18:45.237 --> 18:46.670
Idiot!

18:50.180 --> 18:53.064
Whoa, why can't the TV
show be more like this?

18:53.164 --> 18:55.064
This I like.

18:55.099 --> 18:58.435
Oh my gosh, I totally
dated that chipmunk.

19:01.472 --> 19:02.807
Liz! Liz!

19:02.907 --> 19:04.475
Oh my god, perfect.

19:04.509 --> 19:06.443
Much better seats just opened up.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.812
Hey, Bonnie, a little bad news.

19:08.847 --> 19:12.316
You're fired as both my
realtor and my matchmaker.

19:12.350 --> 19:13.740
Oh, I feel so much better.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.240
I've been wanting to
say that for two days.

19:15.275 --> 19:18.176
What? What... no! No, not now!

19:19.246 --> 19:20.746
Slut!

19:20.780 --> 19:23.082
God, I don't know why I
thought that would work.

19:23.116 --> 19:25.351
Huh, I saw her. I saw Elle.

19:25.385 --> 19:27.052
Who cares about Elle?

19:27.087 --> 19:29.088
Unless you think she needs an apartment,

19:29.122 --> 19:31.023
because I am available.

19:31.057 --> 19:33.592
I care and you would too
if you cared about me.

19:33.627 --> 19:35.794
Stop trying to set me
up with some random girl.

19:35.829 --> 19:39.131
Yeah, but Liz isn't random.
She is perfect for you.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.700
Okay, fine. If you're so
sure, then I'll meet her.

19:41.735 --> 19:44.470
Yeah, well, you know, it's too late now.

19:44.504 --> 19:46.789
She got tired of waiting around for you,

19:46.889 --> 19:48.167
and she's moved on.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.368
So congratulations, Benji,

19:50.403 --> 19:51.770
you got dumped before you ever met her.

19:51.804 --> 19:54.239
Pfft! This is on you, buddy.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.904
Emma, I wasn't a very
good role model tonight.

20:05.539 --> 20:07.640
Never throw food on anyone,

20:07.674 --> 20:10.143
even if you do have hormones
coursing through your body

20:10.177 --> 20:12.979
and residual jealously left
over from a very emotional

20:13.013 --> 20:14.881
and acne-filled time of your life.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.218
Whoa, and you are up way too late,

20:19.253 --> 20:21.187
which means I failed again.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.590
- I'm gonna be a terrible mother.
- I love you, Riley.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.960
I'm gonna be the greatest
mom that ever lived.

20:29.530 --> 20:31.330
Oh, hey, Tuck.

20:31.365 --> 20:33.466
I'm sorry you didn't
get to meet the princess.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.634
Oh, I met her.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.669
Yeah, let's just say the
story has a happy ending.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.139
And if that wasn't clear, we did it.

20:42.197 --> 20:45.093
I think we need to find a different
show for you start watching.

20:46.305 --> 20:52.588
