In the modern world
we're so distracted.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.620
You don't ever have to really
think deeply

40:21.660 --> 40:23.280
but being out here,

40:23.310 --> 40:25.450
you're just so connected
to real life.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.800
You can delve into your soul.

40:28.840 --> 40:32.010
It just makes you feel alive.

40:32.050 --> 40:36.330
And I think if I could
have that in the modern world,

40:36.360 --> 40:38.500
that would be really positive.

40:38.530 --> 40:41.780
It just feels like
a more real way of life.

40:41.810 --> 40:44.780
It's much simpler.

40:44.820 --> 40:47.340
It's just how
we're meant to be.
