00:02.469 --> 00:05.446
- Get in the house right now.
- What the hell you're doing?

00:06.075 --> 00:08.047
- I am your mother.
- Go to hell.

00:08.357 --> 00:09.537
I hit Julie last night.

00:12.667 --> 00:13.604
What you doing?

00:13.923 --> 00:16.167
I guess I feel closer to God
if I'm with you.

00:16.509 --> 00:18.512
Did you think that line
was gonna work on me?

00:18.774 --> 00:19.847
What if I told you

00:20.135 --> 00:23.149
I could make him go away
and you could have your job back?

00:23.468 --> 00:24.745
I'd say you're crazy.

00:25.030 --> 00:27.646
- I wish I was the one who killed him.
- Don't say that.

00:27.908 --> 00:30.217
If anything happens to you
because of me...

00:30.367 --> 00:31.817
I would never forgive myself.

00:32.079 --> 00:34.194
I'm going to Mexico.
Gonna have surgery.

00:34.456 --> 00:37.156
- Probably be walking next time.
- Mexico, huh?

01:10.075 --> 01:11.324
Hold up. Hold up.

01:11.775 --> 01:14.469
- We're good.
- I'ts gotta be here somewhere.

01:16.651 --> 01:18.716
This is it.
The place where miracles happen.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.035
- You're ready for this?
- I'm ready.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.806
I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.

01:27.956 --> 01:30.064
You know how long
it took us to get here?

01:31.095 --> 01:34.254
I'm sorry. Whoever made
the appointment made a mistake.

01:34.816 --> 01:37.216
All right, when's the doctor
gonna be here then?

01:37.517 --> 01:38.967
Probably some time next week.

01:39.230 --> 01:42.532
Probably some time next...
probably some time next week?

01:42.886 --> 01:46.525
This is insane!
What... kind of office is this...

01:46.722 --> 01:49.228
You don't even know, like,
really when he's gonna be here?

01:49.490 --> 01:50.854
Do you run this office, or...

01:51.116 --> 01:54.946
Look, the doctor is on vacation
with his family. I don't know for sure.

01:55.979 --> 01:59.363
Here's a card. Call us in a week,
and we'll fit you in.

02:04.071 --> 02:05.366
<i>Westcott is on fire.</i>

02:06.258 --> 02:07.827
<i>A hand-off up the middlefield.</i>

02:08.080 --> 02:09.832
<i>And another first down.</i>

02:10.103 --> 02:11.173
Pass! Pass!

02:13.348 --> 02:14.348
<i>He's got a man.</i>

02:14.797 --> 02:16.398
<i>He's got it.
He breaks the tackle.</i>

02:17.101 --> 02:21.276
<i>Touchdown, and Westcott goes up a punch.
Our champions gave up to the fight.</i>

02:21.585 --> 02:25.013
Did you see what happened? He threw it,
and the other team made a touchdown.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.820
<i>Our defending champs
are taken to the wood shed.</i>

02:28.373 --> 02:30.144
<i>Saracen hands
the ball to Williams again.</i>

02:30.513 --> 02:34.504
<i>And again, he hits a wall
of Westcott defenders.</i>

02:34.685 --> 02:36.692
<i>That play just is not working.</i>

02:37.369 --> 02:38.485
<i>Williams on the draw.</i>

02:38.747 --> 02:41.000
<i>He's hippity hopping
and he gets nailed.</i>

02:41.150 --> 02:44.474
They're keying on Smash.
Every play. Every darn play.

02:44.815 --> 02:46.491
Yep. Not much imagination.

02:46.745 --> 02:50.163
<i>Coach McGregor might want to think
about something else.</i>

02:50.313 --> 02:53.026
<i>He's running attack with Williams
who is dead in the water.</i>

02:53.178 --> 02:56.080
<i>And his team looks
absolutly frustrated out there.</i>

02:56.432 --> 02:58.469
- All right, let's go !
- <i>Come on. Now.</i>

02:59.193 --> 03:00.530
All right, listen up.

03:00.894 --> 03:04.137
Ball have died. This is retarded.
We're on the same play over and over.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.255
Just run it.

03:05.555 --> 03:08.902
They know we're about to run the ball,
you're not doing well without Riggins.

03:09.052 --> 03:10.225
It's not your call.

03:10.487 --> 03:12.184
Come on !
Clock's running. Let's do this.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.550
Draw to Smash. On one.
Ready.

03:15.010 --> 03:16.409
Come on !

03:16.994 --> 03:18.697
Black 12.

03:19.936 --> 03:23.168
<i>Saracen back to pass.
No, it's another throw to Williams.</i>

03:23.571 --> 03:25.373
<i>And he's got nowhere to go.</i>

03:26.411 --> 03:28.334
<i>And he is drop for a loss.</i>

03:28.484 --> 03:30.954
<i>And here come the boo-birds.</i>

03:31.983 --> 03:34.692
<i>The Dillon Panthers' fans are not happy
about this coach</i>

03:34.970 --> 03:37.340
<i>and situation tonight, folks.
Rightly so.</i>

03:37.491 --> 03:39.922
<i>The nail that doesn't bend
gets hammered,</i>

03:40.184 --> 03:43.454
<i>and Mcgregor has gotten pounded
all night with his ground attack.</i>

03:43.708 --> 03:44.885
<i>Our state champions</i>

03:45.147 --> 03:48.597
<i>have gotten their lunch handed to them
on their home field.</i>

03:48.859 --> 03:51.565
<i>It is a sad state of affairs.</i>

03:54.683 --> 03:56.563
- What a crock.
- Pardon me?

03:56.825 --> 03:59.026
Don't piss on my shoes
and tell me it's raining.

03:59.538 --> 04:00.567
That's a good one.

04:00.829 --> 04:03.516
We just feel like the team needed to...

04:03.751 --> 04:05.809
- go in a new direction.
- After two games?

04:05.959 --> 04:08.242
- Yes, sir.
- After two games?

04:08.507 --> 04:09.962
Two games? This is...

04:10.112 --> 04:12.864
We wanna go ahead
and pay you for the entire season.

04:13.258 --> 04:16.791
Plus we're gonna give you a severance
package just to show you our good will.

04:18.339 --> 04:22.422
- I'm very sorry it worked out this way.
- There ain't no good will in this room.

04:23.817 --> 04:25.217
I'm sorry you feel that way.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.261
Pathetic.

04:32.892 --> 04:34.560
Taylor, you got a phone call.

04:35.747 --> 04:36.770
Hello?

04:37.698 --> 04:39.361
Eric, it's Buddy.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.024
How you doing?

04:41.472 --> 04:43.810
I'm in the middle of a game.
How did you get this number?

04:44.206 --> 04:46.933
Ah, you know me.
Never mind that.

04:47.256 --> 04:50.041
Listen, the eagle has landed.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.718
- What?
- It's a done deal.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.580
We fired him this morning.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.094
Hi. Lyla Garrity.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.591
Okay, guys. Come on.

05:56.741 --> 05:59.525
I apologize for our boys.
They don't get visitors that often.

06:08.146 --> 06:10.081
And so, those are just a few examples

06:10.381 --> 06:13.886
of why it's helpful
to make choices in our lives

06:14.046 --> 06:16.450
with Jesus in our lives.

06:20.494 --> 06:22.876
- That's it.
- Great. Thanks.

06:24.213 --> 06:25.233
Any questions?

06:25.383 --> 06:26.899
Yo, I got a question.

06:28.227 --> 06:29.876
What color panties are you wearing?

06:30.176 --> 06:33.178
That was very funny Doug, very funny.
Five points.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.599
There's more for the rest
if you don't cut it out. Calm down.

06:37.861 --> 06:40.394
Let me ask you a question.
I got a question.

06:40.906 --> 06:43.271
If God's so great,
then why do we have wars, huh?

06:44.567 --> 06:47.192
- Did God catch your tongue?
- I mean, look at Tony over there.

06:47.454 --> 06:51.488
Why's tony's parents drunk all the time
beating on him and his sister?

06:53.171 --> 06:54.171
Well...

06:56.533 --> 06:57.925
That's a good question.

07:02.990 --> 07:03.994
No disrespect,

07:04.445 --> 07:07.252
but you people are always coming in here
acting like you care, right?

07:07.698 --> 07:08.896
When the truth is...

07:09.500 --> 07:13.185
if you see any one of us on the street,
you just run the other way.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.722
- So, who's winning?
- I don't know, it's a tie right now.

07:26.034 --> 07:27.131
So, um...

07:28.329 --> 07:30.579
I was wondering
if you could take me driving.

07:31.039 --> 07:33.197
I can't do it right this second, honey.
I'm sorry.

07:33.576 --> 07:35.887
Mom, I got my permit.
I need to practice.

07:36.037 --> 07:38.887
- I'm aware of that.
- Okay, but it's kind of like homework.

07:39.037 --> 07:40.954
Like you need to practice
in order to pass.

07:42.651 --> 07:46.257
I'm not gonna do it right this second.
Gracie is almost asleep.

07:46.416 --> 07:48.867
I'm exhausted.
I'm watching your dad's game,

07:49.196 --> 07:53.259
I'm not gonna just drop everything when
you want me to go do something. Sorry.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.710
Why is it always about the baby, mom?
I'm still here. You know that, right?

07:57.190 --> 07:59.584
I'm still your daughter too,
just as much as little blob.

07:59.741 --> 08:02.792
I'm know, but you don't have to act like
such a brat about it all the time.

08:03.014 --> 08:04.375
Oh, I'm a brat. Okay.

08:04.548 --> 08:08.023
You're just gonna keep me locked in,
not let me drive or date who I want?

08:08.285 --> 08:09.884
What you're talking about?

08:10.034 --> 08:12.435
I'm gonna go date the Swede.
Just to spite you.

08:12.961 --> 08:14.363
Oh, well, that's really mature.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.448
- I hate you.
- Come back here right now.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.370
What are we watching right now, six?
For the past week.

08:22.209 --> 08:23.683
"Siempre hay una suegra."

08:24.961 --> 08:29.169
We have a bag of money,
we're in Mexico for a week now,

08:29.440 --> 08:32.261
a bag of money, booze, no women,

08:32.412 --> 08:34.227
- no stories, no memories.
- Guess what,

08:34.376 --> 08:36.841
You should have thought about all that
before you came down

08:37.105 --> 08:39.388
in Mexico with me.
I'm here to see a doctor.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.332
And this bag is not a bag of memories.

08:41.482 --> 08:43.683
It's a bag of $10,000 for said doctor.

08:45.277 --> 08:47.587
So, until I see said doctor,

08:48.394 --> 08:51.108
we're not going anywhere,
and neither is the money.

08:51.854 --> 08:52.852
Yeah, you are.

08:53.002 --> 08:55.278
- I'm not gonna need that. Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

08:55.575 --> 08:57.739
- Riggins, do not touch me. Stop!
- We're going out.

08:58.009 --> 08:59.408
No regrets, six, none.

08:59.670 --> 09:00.713
Stop!

09:02.318 --> 09:03.701
- Personal reasons?
- Yes.

09:06.022 --> 09:07.485
Well, you...

09:07.877 --> 09:11.227
you knew your wife was pregnant
when you took this job, didn't you?

09:11.651 --> 09:14.252
Yes, sir. That's true.
Look, Coach, I...

09:16.938 --> 09:18.524
I don't wanna leave you in the lurch.

09:18.675 --> 09:20.646
I'll be here for the Rice
and the Oklahoma game.

09:20.796 --> 09:22.644
The bye week,
we can make the transition.

09:22.794 --> 09:25.035
We take Frank,
put him up for quarterbacks.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.436
It's your decision,
but I'm just thinking about it.

09:27.587 --> 09:30.355
- That might be a smooth transition...
- You sure you wanna do this?

09:32.866 --> 09:34.131
Coach, I have to.

09:34.917 --> 09:37.668
All right. Then you turn in
your id downstairs.

09:37.818 --> 09:40.699
I'll have human resources send over
a termination package tonight.

09:41.923 --> 09:43.372
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.

09:43.839 --> 09:45.746
This isn't IBM, Coach.

09:46.429 --> 09:50.880
I'm not interested in any exit
strategies or transition plans.

09:51.037 --> 09:54.129
If you wanna go, go, and I'll deal
with the situation right now.

09:54.489 --> 09:55.590
So good luck.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.695
Hope you know
what the hell you're doing.

09:59.768 --> 10:02.512
That damn thing kept
scratching up my favorite chair.

10:03.098 --> 10:04.105
And, uh...

10:04.255 --> 10:08.028
I told Landry, I said,
"It's either me or the cat."

10:08.178 --> 10:09.728
'Cause one of us has got to go.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.807
And that's when I initiated the...

10:12.117 --> 10:14.981
the outplacement procedure.

10:15.287 --> 10:16.985
That's what he's calling it.

10:17.247 --> 10:19.065
Technically, Mr. Puddles...

10:20.426 --> 10:22.672
If that's what you wanna call him...

10:22.982 --> 10:23.987
Yeah, hello?

10:24.606 --> 10:26.262
- Hold this up.
- Hold on...

10:26.412 --> 10:27.662
His name was Mr. Puddles?

10:27.925 --> 10:29.282
Ironically, he was she.

10:29.551 --> 10:30.537
Of course.

10:30.903 --> 10:34.085
Once again,
being a genius, and everything,

10:34.349 --> 10:37.442
I hadn't quite figured out
the whole he, she...

10:37.726 --> 10:39.154
However you wanna put it.

10:43.882 --> 10:45.710
Sorry, guys.
I have got to go.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.600
They just pulled a body
out of the river.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.318
Sorry, baby.

10:52.324 --> 10:53.560
Save me a plate, okay?

10:54.743 --> 10:56.301
Tyra, it's good to see you again.

10:57.496 --> 10:59.175
Landry, I'll talk to you later, bud.

11:15.511 --> 11:19.496
Today we're looking at guilt
and redemption, sin and grace.

11:19.871 --> 11:22.200
Consider the story of king David.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.693
The beautiful bathsheba catches his eye.

11:25.023 --> 11:28.674
He commits adultery with her
and decides he wants her as his wife.

11:29.231 --> 11:32.543
This means getting rid of her husband,
so David plans a conspiracy

11:32.823 --> 11:35.765
to ensure the husband's
murder in battle.

11:36.645 --> 11:38.450
He thinks he gets away with it,

11:38.985 --> 11:41.417
but God sees, and God knows.

11:41.907 --> 11:46.746
I'm telling you. It was like everyone
in the entire church knew.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.932
- You're just being weird.
- I'm not being paranoid.

11:50.215 --> 11:52.455
- How would they know?
- This isn't some little thing.

11:52.717 --> 11:54.665
This is ridiculous, me thinking

11:54.860 --> 11:57.189
that no one's gonna find out.
I know what I've got to do.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.087
- It's...
- What are you talking about?

11:59.352 --> 12:00.802
I've gotta go turn myself in.

12:00.952 --> 12:03.821
And explain that this was just...
this was a huge accident

12:03.999 --> 12:06.928
and just hope that they, you know,
go easy on me because my dad's a cop.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.680
That's not gonna happen.

12:10.318 --> 12:12.807
What do you think they're gonna do?
Slap you on the wrist?

12:14.456 --> 12:15.895
I have no idea

12:16.165 --> 12:17.981
- what else to do.
- We're in this together.

12:18.243 --> 12:19.817
I can't keep doing this.

12:20.091 --> 12:22.777
We have no choice.
You understand we have no choice.

12:23.389 --> 12:24.681
We have no choice.

12:25.251 --> 12:27.100
No, we... you're wrong.
We do have a choice.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.754
I can turn myself in,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

12:29.904 --> 12:33.580
- Spend the rest of your life in jail?
- Spend it in jail or what?

12:33.965 --> 12:36.416
What's the alternative?
Spend the rest of my life like this?

12:40.015 --> 12:41.527
We're in this together, okay?

12:46.787 --> 12:47.787
It's us.

12:52.409 --> 12:53.442
Pass, ma'am.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.405
Thank you.

12:56.742 --> 12:57.841
Thank you.

13:06.179 --> 13:08.414
if this is your escape plan,
it needs work.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.414
I was just kidding.
I heard you got out. Congratulations.

13:16.694 --> 13:18.733
Yeah, I'm on probation now.
Congratulations.

13:19.719 --> 13:20.996
Okay.

13:26.813 --> 13:28.340
What are you trying to do?

13:28.605 --> 13:31.317
I'm putting my money
where my mouth is. Come on.

13:38.737 --> 13:41.441
So what are you gonna do?
Do you have any plans or anything?

13:43.645 --> 13:44.645
Not really.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.646
I mean, are you gonna go to school or...

13:48.547 --> 13:49.701
I guess so.

13:50.418 --> 13:53.493
Gotta get a job too. My probation lady
will be all over my ass about it.

13:54.036 --> 13:55.286
What do your parents say?

13:56.056 --> 13:57.956
Damn, you ask a lot of questions, huh?

13:58.527 --> 13:59.541
Sorry.

14:00.706 --> 14:01.835
I guess I'm just...

14:02.461 --> 14:04.587
- ... interested.
- If I tell you, will you shut up?

14:04.937 --> 14:07.440
- I promise.
- My parents are in Mexico.

14:07.590 --> 14:09.831
They got deported two years ago.

14:10.295 --> 14:13.837
Left me to live with my uncle
who has a son, my cousin the homey,

14:14.072 --> 14:17.225
a real inspiration to me and told me
how selling weed to people like you.

14:17.798 --> 14:20.011
Maybe not you.
Anyway, that's how I got picked up.

14:20.161 --> 14:22.180
Spent two years in juvie.
Now I'm here. Happy?

14:22.450 --> 14:23.606
Look, stop here.

14:23.949 --> 14:25.115
I could take you in.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.023
You don't want to bring
this car in here.

14:27.971 --> 14:29.075
Gotta go.

14:29.828 --> 14:30.828
Okay, well...

14:31.351 --> 14:33.825
Can I? Can I get your number?

14:34.572 --> 14:36.168
Just a way to keep in touch.

14:38.071 --> 14:39.845
So if this surgery's so great,

14:39.995 --> 14:42.906
why can't you just...
Why isn't it okay in the states?

14:43.076 --> 14:45.103
Because, like I told you,

14:45.272 --> 14:48.391
between washington and the AMA,
gonna take forever to get it legalized.

14:48.541 --> 14:50.076
And I ain't got forever.

14:50.485 --> 14:51.950
No more questions.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.503
Yeah, but you... you're saying...

14:55.576 --> 14:58.655
the parallel bars,
and the guy that could move his toes.

14:59.284 --> 15:00.660
You know, I mean, that's...

15:01.588 --> 15:04.496
I wanna know if any of these guys
have walked again.

15:04.909 --> 15:06.114
What are you doing?

15:08.268 --> 15:09.319
What are you doing?

15:09.623 --> 15:13.357
I was asking if any of these guys
have ever actually walked.

15:13.668 --> 15:15.742
No. Nobody else has walked yet.
It doesn't matter.

15:16.325 --> 15:19.813
I told you I'm a perfect
candidate for the surgery.

15:19.979 --> 15:22.040
I regained feeling in my right hand.

15:22.324 --> 15:25.257
The other couldn't feel anything.
The guy that's doing the parallel bars

15:25.407 --> 15:28.546
had no feeling in any extremity.
They couldn't even move a muscle.

15:28.808 --> 15:31.174
<i>Señores...
Papeles, por favor.</i>

15:31.698 --> 15:33.354
<i>- What?
- Papeles, por favor.</i>

15:33.700 --> 15:36.206
- Id?
- Wallet. Wallet.

15:36.775 --> 15:39.015
- Put those down.
- He wants a beer, relax.

15:39.277 --> 15:41.559
Put them down immediately,
don't talk back right now.

15:42.130 --> 15:43.275
Here you go, sir.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.718
Thank you, officer.

15:45.347 --> 15:47.370
<i>- Detenme esto.
- Six, relax.</i>

15:47.520 --> 15:49.170
<i>- Detenme esto.
- Yes, sir.</i>

15:49.320 --> 15:52.612
Been through this a million times.
He's not even talking to anybody.

15:52.874 --> 15:54.322
He wants memories as well, six.

15:54.945 --> 15:57.745
He wants a night on the town.
He wants some senoritas.

15:58.229 --> 16:00.078
- What's it gonna take?
- What are you doing?

16:00.652 --> 16:02.914
What's it gonna take?
You want some memories?

16:03.470 --> 16:04.952
Some señoritas.

16:10.596 --> 16:12.305
Cheers. Go cowboy.

16:15.146 --> 16:16.155
Sweet, six.

16:16.415 --> 16:18.674
Took you long enough,
now thosa gals are probably gone.

16:18.824 --> 16:21.578
Shut your mouth. I should have left you
in there all damn night.

16:21.728 --> 16:24.730
Sad sorry ass. I'm not supposed to be
spending my money on your bail.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.998
Yeah, it's my fault that we found
the only honest cop in Mexico.

16:28.148 --> 16:29.284
Your ass, Riggins.

16:29.702 --> 16:32.318
You know this money for my surgery
is not for your damn bail.

16:32.580 --> 16:33.970
What's your problem, six?

16:34.555 --> 16:36.859
You know what?
I came down here for a reason.

16:37.009 --> 16:38.618
You think it's stupid, but it's not.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.828
Go ahead and get loaded tonight
and catch syphilis from whatever

16:42.095 --> 16:45.165
skanky jailbait random hooker
or whore you can find on the street,

16:45.475 --> 16:47.083
but I'm going back to the hotel.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.328
Can you at least buy me a couple tacos?

16:55.373 --> 16:58.303
Oh, could it be, could it be?

16:59.741 --> 17:04.135
Guess who's home?
Julie, dad's home!

17:04.849 --> 17:05.849
Jules?

17:15.675 --> 17:17.921
- What's up?
- Hey, come here.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.438
- How are you? I missed you.
- I'm good.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.291
Good to see you, kid.

17:24.935 --> 17:27.077
- Hi, hon.
- How you doing?

17:27.499 --> 17:28.748
How's my little one doing?

17:29.020 --> 17:30.284
She's good.

17:31.764 --> 17:34.047
- Why is Buddy Garrity here?
- What's wrong, my child?

17:34.680 --> 17:35.715
Hey Buddy.

17:35.986 --> 17:37.467
Look what I found sitting in road.

17:38.484 --> 17:40.671
Look what I founf.
Look what I found on the road.

17:40.940 --> 17:43.014
I put it in the truck.
Here it is.

17:43.275 --> 17:44.298
Go to your mama.

17:44.584 --> 17:46.568
He's dirty.
I'll be in for dinner in a second.

17:46.718 --> 17:49.407
You just got home, so y'all don't stay
out here too long now.

17:49.557 --> 17:50.897
I'll be in in just a second.

17:51.159 --> 17:52.523
He just got home, Buddy, so...

17:52.785 --> 17:55.160
- Nice to see you. Great to see you.
- You too, Tami.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.554
Hey, man, how you doin'?

17:57.371 --> 17:58.713
Y'all don't be long now.

17:59.447 --> 18:00.940
What are you doing?

18:01.252 --> 18:04.182
Have you been waiting at the beginning
of the neighborhood or something?

18:04.332 --> 18:06.989
- You followed me in here?
- Mcgregor's gonna fight us on this.

18:08.426 --> 18:10.780
Well I just got the call.
That's why I ran over.

18:10.984 --> 18:15.321
Evidently he's apparently
got some lawyer,

18:15.473 --> 18:20.018
and he refuses to sign anything. There's
an emergency board meeting tomorrow.

18:21.686 --> 18:23.461
Are you telling me I don't have a job?

18:24.475 --> 18:25.510
No.

18:25.902 --> 18:28.664
It's just... it's just a little
complication, that's all.

18:28.814 --> 18:31.214
You understand I signed
a no-compete, don't you?

18:31.364 --> 18:33.523
I can't take on any college jobs
for two years.

18:33.785 --> 18:35.180
You understand that, don't you?

18:35.995 --> 18:39.035
"Done, done." That's what you said.
You said "it's a done deal."

18:39.185 --> 18:41.294
"It's a done deal, Eric,"
that's what it is.

18:41.918 --> 18:44.351
- What the hell happened?
- I'm sorry, it just...

18:44.501 --> 18:46.494
- You're sorry?
- Now, we just got a little...

18:46.933 --> 18:49.444
It's just a little hitch
in our get-along. That's all it is.

18:49.652 --> 18:50.652
Trust me.

18:51.604 --> 18:52.846
I'm gonna do my best.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.873
What about...
What about painting the garage?

18:59.023 --> 19:00.823
Dad's obviously never gonna do that.

19:01.026 --> 19:02.440
The garage is fine.

19:03.471 --> 19:05.334
Well, there's got to be something, mom.

19:05.484 --> 19:08.050
If he has a job,
it helps him with his probation.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.185
Okay, do you even hear
what you're saying?

19:10.335 --> 19:12.500
I mean, this boy is an ex-convict.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.216
Mom, he's just a kid.

19:14.378 --> 19:16.704
You want him hanging around
with your brother and sister?

19:16.859 --> 19:17.859
It's not safe.

19:18.249 --> 19:21.237
Oh, my God, mom.
You don't even know him.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.664
And neither do you.

19:23.227 --> 19:26.951
Look, I appreciate what you're trying
to do here, but the answer is no.

19:27.257 --> 19:28.257
I'm sorry.

19:33.026 --> 19:34.292
Slow down a little bit.

19:34.727 --> 19:37.080
Use your mirrors.
What's over your righthand shoulder?

19:39.472 --> 19:40.840
- Did you look?
- I looked.

19:41.303 --> 19:42.336
Good job.

19:43.153 --> 19:44.135
Thank you.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.850
What's this about you
and the swedish kid?

19:51.112 --> 19:53.519
That was really subtle.
Did mom even give you cue cards?

19:53.976 --> 19:56.159
No, this doesn't have anything
to do with your mom.

19:56.309 --> 19:58.209
She obviously has an opinion, however.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.818
But this is me asking you.
I want to hear it from you.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.702
Mom doesn't like him 'cause he's older.

20:03.220 --> 20:04.155
How much older?

20:04.417 --> 20:07.033
It doesn't even matter.
Mom has me in lockdown at our house.

20:07.421 --> 20:08.981
Your mother loves you very much.

20:09.131 --> 20:11.426
You have bigger things
to worry about, like your job.

20:11.693 --> 20:13.586
Don't bring my job up.
I'll take care of that.

20:13.737 --> 20:16.492
- That's none of your business, my job.
- It's none of my business?

20:16.642 --> 20:18.544
No, don't give me that look.
Watch the road.

20:23.501 --> 20:27.489
What's this about... what's this about
I hear you and this kid

20:28.916 --> 20:30.409
carrying on in the driveway?

20:30.693 --> 20:33.017
- Oh, we're carrying on now?
- Yes, carrying on.

20:33.879 --> 20:37.438
Don't look at me like that. I don't like
your tone... Watch out for the road.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.508
Keep your eye on the road.
Look out up here.

20:39.658 --> 20:40.916
You got this turn up here.

20:41.204 --> 20:43.361
Get on the other lane.
This goes on to the highway.

20:43.623 --> 20:45.971
You gotta get over to the right.
Get in the other lane.

20:46.274 --> 20:47.908
Watch out!
Look out for that!

20:49.007 --> 20:51.035
Damn it.
You almost hit this guy.

20:51.297 --> 20:52.912
I can't drive when you're yelling!

20:53.174 --> 20:56.374
Look, just stay right where you are.
Just stay right where you are.

20:56.993 --> 20:59.455
This is great.
We can do the operation on Thursday.

20:59.605 --> 21:02.327
Those Texas docs nailed your fusion,
so we can skip decompression

21:02.602 --> 21:05.099
- and go right for the injections.
- The stem cells.

21:05.395 --> 21:07.405
Technically,
they're embryonic stem cells,

21:07.556 --> 21:09.303
but the sharks don't
make the distinction.

21:09.622 --> 21:10.751
Hang on. Wait.

21:11.868 --> 21:14.638
Did you just say you're gonna give him
a shot from a shark, doc?

21:15.231 --> 21:16.589
Yeah.
Pretty cool stuff.

21:17.225 --> 21:20.558
Sharks have one of the strongest
immune systems in nature.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.688
It decreases the risk of rejection
and runaway cell growth.

21:23.955 --> 21:26.392
We don't want your friend here
going all "jaws" on us.

21:26.854 --> 21:27.854
And again, uh...

21:28.953 --> 21:30.700
why can't they do this in the states?

21:31.359 --> 21:32.628
Because...

21:33.370 --> 21:35.623
the FDA are a bunch or crybabies.

21:36.984 --> 21:37.999
Okay.

21:39.577 --> 21:41.185
I don't even want to go out with them.

21:41.335 --> 21:45.423
Everyone's gonna think I jock Smash
as much as Smash jocks Smash,

21:45.685 --> 21:47.851
And I don't.
We all know that I don't.

21:48.283 --> 21:49.334
What's the point?

21:49.605 --> 21:52.930
- He used to be cool, but now...
- Just go out with one of Smash's girls.

21:53.192 --> 21:57.184
I mean, you need some kind of rebound
to get over Julie because it's obviously

21:57.446 --> 21:59.612
- ... affecting everything.
- This is a gold mine.

21:59.907 --> 22:03.030
- Would they people pay?
- Wouldn't they pay, real question.

22:04.561 --> 22:08.196
Hey, space cadet.
Working on a business venture, here.

22:09.026 --> 22:10.479
If that's what you wanna call it.

22:10.629 --> 22:14.636
Look, I just don't see anybody paying
y'all to walk around their lawns naked.

22:15.097 --> 22:16.297
Half-naked, or whatever.

22:16.447 --> 22:18.998
We're not walking around their lawns,
and you're being a snot.

22:21.147 --> 22:22.349
- None of it?
- None.

22:22.697 --> 22:24.434
You kinda in all of this on your own.

22:25.892 --> 22:27.701
The Smash talking in the locker room.

22:32.705 --> 22:33.885
What's the deal?

22:35.308 --> 22:37.058
One loss and y'all quit practicing?

22:39.399 --> 22:40.648
Oh, man.

22:41.244 --> 22:44.577
- Just kidding, man.
- We lost the same game last year too,

22:44.727 --> 22:48.544
and that worked out okay, so, you know,
we don't want to get too cocky.

22:48.831 --> 22:51.255
- All right. Y'all be good.
- All right. Y'all enjoy.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.025
What's the matter with you.
You okay?

22:59.170 --> 23:01.859
What's wrong, man?
You look like you're about to throw up.

23:02.108 --> 23:03.958
Uh, just something's wrong with my...

23:05.063 --> 23:06.963
my burger.
It don't taste-- I'm fine.

23:07.916 --> 23:10.173
- No, ma'am.
- That is incorrect

23:10.436 --> 23:13.804
- on the issue of cause for termination.
- Cause? Wait, what cause?

23:14.200 --> 23:16.415
- Nobody ever gave a reason.
- Ma'am,

23:16.743 --> 23:19.316
excuse me, we had a student get injured.

23:19.820 --> 23:21.718
Had to go to the hospital
from a practice

23:21.989 --> 23:24.298
that went over time limits.
That was against the rules.

23:24.769 --> 23:27.731
He got a little overheated. They
gave him some fluids, and he was fine.

23:27.881 --> 23:29.830
We're talking about Tim Riggins.

23:30.122 --> 23:32.364
Everybody knows Tim Riggins.
He was probably hung over.

23:33.235 --> 23:34.988
It's an excuse which you all

23:35.253 --> 23:38.035
have just dreamed up in order
to justify the lynching of my client.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.645
Coach McGregor...

23:45.152 --> 23:48.558
was fired because
we simply do not like the way

23:49.086 --> 23:52.617
he has abandoned
our tradition here in Dillon.

23:53.176 --> 23:56.126
He has come in, he has changed
practices, closed them down.

23:56.276 --> 23:58.055
He is not attending
booster club meetings.

23:58.317 --> 24:00.085
He has changed the pep rally,

24:00.235 --> 24:03.978
and he's managed
to destroy our record-setting

24:04.240 --> 24:06.731
offense in a very short period of time.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.720
Which has angered
many parents and many fans.

24:10.292 --> 24:11.762
Not to mention the players.

24:12.898 --> 24:13.978
I believe I saw

24:14.251 --> 24:17.325
I believe I saw our quarterback
and our star running back

24:17.587 --> 24:20.648
in a fistfight at the end of the game

24:21.024 --> 24:23.494
the other night in the middle
of the Daggon football field.

24:23.759 --> 24:25.954
It was in a game you won, Buddy.

24:26.282 --> 24:27.991
That's not the point, Barbara.

24:28.776 --> 24:31.797
That's not the point.
You, being from Laribee,

24:32.059 --> 24:34.350
wouldn't understand.
But here in Dillon, we win seasons.

24:35.010 --> 24:36.362
we win seasons.

24:36.831 --> 24:39.714
We don't win games.
State championships.

24:40.371 --> 24:42.516
Unfortunately, coach Mcgregor

24:42.925 --> 24:44.869
was not getting the job done.

24:45.241 --> 24:46.241
We fired him.

24:46.996 --> 24:48.269
End of story.

24:48.816 --> 24:50.566
You're speaking for everybody here?

24:52.958 --> 24:54.570
You bet your ass I am.

24:56.610 --> 24:59.559
- Well, it's undermining me.
- It's not undermining you.

24:59.709 --> 25:02.326
- How am I undermining you?
- Well, you were coming in here...

25:03.218 --> 25:04.997
You don't know how it's been,
sweetheart.

25:05.524 --> 25:08.332
She has been horrible.
She has treated me...

25:08.596 --> 25:11.486
- horribly.
- I know I don't know what's going on.

25:11.636 --> 25:14.691
But please, let's start new.
Let's just talk to her.

25:15.492 --> 25:16.496
Come on.

25:16.771 --> 25:17.760
Julie!

25:19.809 --> 25:22.353
Jules! Please come in here, please.

25:26.748 --> 25:29.095
- Hey, good morning, kiddo.
- Good morning, sunshine.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.523
Good morning.

25:32.149 --> 25:33.985
Mother has something
she wants to tell you.

25:34.135 --> 25:36.177
Your father and I
have been talking, and,

25:36.328 --> 25:41.363
I have-- we have together very, very,
very tentatively decided

25:42.114 --> 25:43.744
that you are not gonna be grounded.

25:44.769 --> 25:45.765
What's the catch?

25:45.915 --> 25:49.625
No catch other than you need to behave
like I know you know how to.

25:49.887 --> 25:52.469
There's four of us in this family.
You need to respect that?

25:53.872 --> 25:54.877
Thank you.

25:55.810 --> 25:58.174
By the way, congratulations, dad.
It's all over the paper.

25:58.325 --> 25:59.336
What is?

26:01.193 --> 26:02.365
What's in the paper?

26:03.805 --> 26:05.706
Bring it in here.
Bring the paper here.

26:05.867 --> 26:08.320
All right, all right.
Ouch, Jesus.

26:15.493 --> 26:17.512
{\McGregor fired - Taylor to replaced him?}

26:22.691 --> 26:24.255
See, right on that line.

26:24.547 --> 26:26.036
Right there. No.
First of all,

26:26.298 --> 26:29.165
you have to-- remember
you have to go forward of the car

26:29.427 --> 26:30.498
and back into it.

26:30.761 --> 26:33.254
There's a car right there.
You just hit that car.

26:33.404 --> 26:36.338
Honey, you need to pull outside the car,
and back up.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.669
I'm backing up.

26:38.566 --> 26:42.387
Now pull forward to the side of the car,
and then back to the curb.

26:43.021 --> 26:45.718
Side of the car.
Okay, look at me go.

26:46.777 --> 26:49.017
- Back to the curb.
- Honey, you're not even listening.

26:49.167 --> 26:51.183
- I'm listening.
- Just turn the car off.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.607
Just turn the car off.
Let's just take a break.

26:54.032 --> 26:55.982
Let's just sit for a minute, all right?

27:06.350 --> 27:08.650
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something.

27:12.118 --> 27:16.378
When I was younger I--
There was a guy, his name was Doug Odom,

27:16.793 --> 27:18.879
- he was a lot older than me.
- Mom, don't do this.

27:19.393 --> 27:20.424
Listen, please.

27:20.686 --> 27:21.693
Thank you.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.759
I was obsessed with him.

27:23.941 --> 27:26.617
And we went to this party once
on fourth of july,

27:26.918 --> 27:29.429
I was with him
and all his fancy friends, and...

27:33.147 --> 27:34.147
Anyway...

27:36.565 --> 27:38.053
I slept with him that night.

27:38.310 --> 27:40.818
And that was the first time
I'd ever slept with anybody.

27:42.169 --> 27:45.776
I woke up the next morning, I thought
we were gonna be boyfriend and girlfrie

27:45.926 --> 27:48.419
and I saw him the next day and...

27:51.983 --> 27:52.983
He treated me...

27:53.976 --> 27:55.376
like I didn't really matter.

27:57.088 --> 27:59.088
Like what happened didn't really matter.

28:01.197 --> 28:03.211
And you're spending
all this time with this...

28:03.887 --> 28:06.253
boy who doesn't seem to have a name,

28:07.511 --> 28:09.295
I know you like him.

28:10.623 --> 28:13.285
- I know you think he likes you.
- His name is Anton.

28:13.932 --> 28:15.135
And he does like me.

28:17.192 --> 28:18.484
Well, he doesn't love you.

28:20.940 --> 28:22.319
And that's the difference.

28:29.503 --> 28:30.803
- Bye, y'all.
- Bye, dad.

28:30.953 --> 28:32.508
- See you, dad.
- That was fun.

28:33.427 --> 28:35.029
- See you next week.
- See you, Thab.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.902
Remember what I said, little bud.

28:37.052 --> 28:38.479
Did you have fun?

28:38.733 --> 28:39.737
How are you?

28:40.030 --> 28:41.360
I'll be in in a second, okay?

28:48.160 --> 28:50.508
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

28:51.798 --> 28:54.132
Has Lyla talked to you at all
about this boy?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.049
No. We, uh...

28:58.403 --> 28:59.607
We're sort of in a...

28:59.766 --> 29:03.259
feeling each other out mode right now.
There's not a whole lot of sharing.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.025
Well, let me tell you where she met him.
She met him in prison.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.232
Okay? At some...

29:08.576 --> 29:11.600
counseling session
for christ team messengers.

29:13.143 --> 29:16.571
- Pam, we've had this talk before...
- She wanted me to hire him.

29:17.097 --> 29:20.224
And when I said no,
she called me unchristian.

29:20.514 --> 29:21.717
And just walked out.

29:23.642 --> 29:24.928
Can you believe that?

29:27.946 --> 29:29.899
- She tried to find him a job.
- Yes.

29:30.293 --> 29:31.843
I mean, can you imagine this...

29:32.234 --> 29:35.561
ex-convict in our house with the kids
and me there all alone?

29:37.258 --> 29:39.146
- It's not right.
- Tell you what.

29:39.408 --> 29:41.190
I'll handle it.
I'll take care of it.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.817
- Good.
- Okay.

29:44.079 --> 29:44.942
Thank you.

29:45.477 --> 29:46.510
You're welcome.

29:48.735 --> 29:51.385
Santiago, have you ever had
any sales experience?

29:52.892 --> 29:55.123
- Not really, sir.
- Well, you ever worked on cars?

29:55.273 --> 29:56.998
You ever do any mechanic work?

29:57.545 --> 29:58.846
I usually take the bus.

29:59.503 --> 30:00.503
Take the bus?

30:01.902 --> 30:04.555
He had a job last year, right?
Doing dishes?

30:04.962 --> 30:08.092
Yeah. I had a job last year.
Doing dishes like she said.

30:08.910 --> 30:09.910
Well...

30:10.633 --> 30:11.637
it's something.

30:11.899 --> 30:15.234
It has nothing to do with cars,
but at least it shows he's responsible.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.229
Can I talk?

30:19.025 --> 30:20.930
Yes, sir. Please do.
This is an interview.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.493
I'd love for you to talk.

30:24.786 --> 30:27.294
Look, I know I don't have
no experience, sir.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.323
I'm guessing she probably told you
I've been in juvie.

30:32.117 --> 30:35.253
I don't mean no disrespect to you
or to this place, but...

30:36.101 --> 30:37.445
I have to get a job, sir.

30:38.262 --> 30:41.360
If I don't get a job, they're gonna send
me back to state, I don't wanna to.

30:41.642 --> 30:44.177
I'll do anything you ask me
and try not to mess it up too bad.

30:44.327 --> 30:45.127
I promise.

30:46.290 --> 30:48.019
- I promise.
- I appreciate that.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.093
And if Lyla vouches for you...

30:52.185 --> 30:54.179
- I do.
- I'll go with you.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.665
I'll do it. I'll give you a job
in the parts department.

30:58.885 --> 31:02.036
It's only 8.50 an hour
and you have to work on weekends.

31:02.627 --> 31:03.847
That sounds great, sir.

31:04.243 --> 31:05.275
Thank you.

31:29.350 --> 31:31.116
Sorry, we were supposed
to hang out, right?

31:32.135 --> 31:33.688
Uh, yeah.

31:34.468 --> 31:35.637
Come on inside.

31:39.403 --> 31:40.434
Come on.

32:01.032 --> 32:02.976
- Your phone was ringing.
- My what?

32:03.335 --> 32:04.901
Your phone was ringing.

32:05.288 --> 32:07.474
Oh, well, that's probably just Jonesy.

32:07.765 --> 32:10.422
I told him we were going
to dry creek, and he got...

32:10.840 --> 32:12.145
all excited.

32:13.352 --> 32:14.596
What's dry creek?

32:16.056 --> 32:17.216
What's dry creek?

32:18.263 --> 32:19.393
You know, it's...

32:19.891 --> 32:23.750
It's got foosball, you know, and, and,

32:24.154 --> 32:27.064
I don't know two-for-one beer night,
and I think Kennedy

32:27.326 --> 32:28.801
and Chris are gonna join us, so...

32:28.951 --> 32:31.515
Jonesy called Spike
and Spike called Spencer...

32:32.854 --> 32:33.854
and...

32:34.935 --> 32:36.198
is there something wrong?

32:37.664 --> 32:38.664
Yeah, um...

32:39.379 --> 32:40.379
I just, um...

32:41.254 --> 32:44.730
I'm just feeling really sick,
and I think I should go home, okay?

32:45.085 --> 32:48.503
Yeah, um, but you know what?
Have fun, and I'll...

32:49.254 --> 32:51.546
Hey, you need...
you need a ride home?

32:51.868 --> 32:53.042
It's okay, I got it.

32:58.202 --> 32:59.202
Hey, babe.

33:06.406 --> 33:07.703
How was your night?

33:12.360 --> 33:13.360
Jules?

33:18.293 --> 33:19.296
What happened?

33:21.972 --> 33:22.986
You all right?

33:26.775 --> 33:28.845
Come here.
Come here.

33:40.257 --> 33:41.985
- This is yours?
- Now you wanna drink

33:42.276 --> 33:45.434
a week later,
after I've been boozing all week.

33:45.696 --> 33:48.103
They got a picture of John Wayne.
Let's toast to the duke.

33:48.365 --> 33:50.774
- Here's to J. Wayne.
- Here's to J. Wayne.

33:51.574 --> 33:52.812
Cheers, my friend.

33:56.932 --> 33:59.344
- Let's go. Round two.
- Round eight, soon enough.

33:59.494 --> 34:00.634
Round two right now.

34:01.579 --> 34:02.618
To walking.

34:03.740 --> 34:04.841
To runnin'.

34:27.686 --> 34:28.893
Is this in english?

34:29.480 --> 34:30.851
What do you got, six?

34:58.731 --> 34:59.925
Clear eyes, Timmy!

35:22.936 --> 35:25.453
Tomorrow's a big day for me, folks.

35:25.687 --> 35:26.692
It's a big day.

35:27.751 --> 35:28.823
You know why?

35:29.648 --> 35:32.684
I'm gonna walk-a, I'm gonna walk-a,

35:33.079 --> 35:35.032
I'm gonna get out of my chair,

35:35.483 --> 35:38.271
and I'm-a run-a, and I'm-a run-a,

35:39.143 --> 35:43.857
and I'm-a get right outta there
because Dillon sucks, folks.

35:44.147 --> 35:46.125
Dillon is an awful place to be,

35:46.400 --> 35:50.138
and I wanna walk away,
and tomorrow, I'm gonna do it.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.596
Look at me.
No, I'm serious!

35:55.659 --> 35:57.404
No, I'm serious, I'm serious.

35:58.128 --> 35:59.348
Tomorrow I'm getting a--

35:59.621 --> 36:03.524
I'm gettin' a shot-a, I'm gettin'
a shot-a right in my spine and

36:03.675 --> 36:06.210
it's gonna make me walk again, folks.

36:09.106 --> 36:12.115
You don't even know what I'm sayin',
but you believe me.

36:14.326 --> 36:15.566
I believe it too.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.961
Timmy, you believe it, don't you?

36:22.045 --> 36:23.050
Le it go !

36:28.846 --> 36:31.610
I'm gonna walk, Timmy!
Timmy, I'm gonna walk again!

36:42.844 --> 36:43.945
What's up?

36:44.207 --> 36:47.182
Uh, I just got a call
from the Dillon police.

36:49.963 --> 36:52.204
- What they'd want?
- Well, why don't you tell me?

36:52.466 --> 36:55.707
I really don't know. We have to go
down there right now. Get dressed.

37:01.479 --> 37:03.829
We pulled a body from the river
a few days ago.

37:03.979 --> 37:05.098
Male caucasian.

37:05.932 --> 37:09.182
I need to ask you a couple
of questions about it if you're ready.

37:15.703 --> 37:17.103
We found this in the wallet.

37:17.449 --> 37:18.749
You recognize this person?

37:22.255 --> 37:24.961
Yeah, it-- Yes.

37:25.393 --> 37:27.835
- How do you know him?
- He, um..

37:29.684 --> 37:32.784
He attacked me.
He tried to... He tried to rape me.

37:34.092 --> 37:35.885
What? Honey, what?

37:36.044 --> 37:38.440
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- Why didn't you tell me?

37:38.624 --> 37:40.493
Tyra, stay with me now.

37:41.481 --> 37:43.237
Is this the man
who sexually assaulted you

37:43.518 --> 37:46.654
in the parking lot
of the Alamo Freeze last november?

37:47.409 --> 37:49.052
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

37:49.362 --> 37:52.212
I really wanna thank you ladies
for coming out like this.

37:52.862 --> 37:53.862
Wait.

37:55.468 --> 37:57.420
- Is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.479
You did a real good job
on your description.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.898
We matched it
with a sketch this morning.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.928
Look, here's your sketch.

38:04.477 --> 38:06.486
This boy was wanted
for rape in two other states.

38:06.748 --> 38:08.786
Oh, my God.
Honey...

38:09.330 --> 38:10.441
I'm sorry, mom.

38:10.842 --> 38:11.992
You can rest easy now.

38:12.389 --> 38:13.789
We're gonna close this case.

38:15.191 --> 38:18.046
There'll be someone to show you out,
ladies. Thank you very much.

38:18.347 --> 38:19.347
Thank you.

38:21.744 --> 38:22.857
Thank you.

38:31.473 --> 38:33.221
I don't know,
it's some kind of experiment

38:33.719 --> 38:35.677
where they're injecting him
with shark blood,

38:35.827 --> 38:37.434
it's supposed to make him walk again.

38:39.710 --> 38:40.884
Tim, are you drunk?

38:41.739 --> 38:43.015
No, Lyla, I'm not drunk.

38:43.185 --> 38:45.870
Maybe I'm not explaining
this very well, but...

38:46.724 --> 38:49.237
I don't know. All this medical stuff
is just over my head.

38:49.499 --> 38:51.615
You know,
Jason's parents are worried sick.

38:51.877 --> 38:54.900
Yeah, well, I am, too.
He might actually go through with this.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.049
So what am I supposed to do?

38:59.807 --> 39:00.962
Come down here.

39:01.759 --> 39:03.293
Help me talk him out of it.

39:04.569 --> 39:07.599
Come to Mexico?
Are you outta your mind?

39:21.637 --> 39:24.703
I swear, J's gonna die
if he goes through with this, Lyla.

39:24.881 --> 39:27.779
I haven't asked for anything from you,
I'm asking you to come down here

39:27.930 --> 39:31.164
and help me help J.
He's not listening to me.

39:34.879 --> 39:36.201
Help me.

39:36.986 --> 39:38.135
Please.

39:44.313 --> 39:47.560
I'm gonna tell you one
of my favorite things about myself.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.861
But Gracie'll start.
Gracie, start tellin'.

39:50.011 --> 39:52.053
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

39:52.231 --> 39:54.161
Because you tell her every five minutes.

39:54.311 --> 39:56.024
You're filling her head full of it.

39:56.719 --> 39:57.722
Hey, Coach.

39:59.475 --> 40:00.709
Coach, how you doing?

40:01.217 --> 40:02.794
I was filling up the truck,

40:03.076 --> 40:06.110
I was rolling outta town,
and I just thought I'd come by and,

40:06.269 --> 40:09.317
congratulate you, because it worked out
just the way you wanted.

40:10.063 --> 40:11.800
- How's that?
- How's that?

40:12.445 --> 40:14.595
You know, Eric,
I've been a coach a long time.

40:15.002 --> 40:17.529
I been fired before,
and I'll probably be fired again.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.093
But this is the first time
I been screwed by another coach.

40:20.487 --> 40:22.093
Just wait a second here.

40:22.384 --> 40:25.750
- You were involved in this thing.
- I don't appreciate that accusation.

40:26.012 --> 40:28.867
It's the truth. You're not gonna lie
to me here at your doorstep.

40:29.018 --> 40:30.154
I don't think you are.

40:32.742 --> 40:36.046
I know you were involved, maybe you had
your reasons, maybe you didn't.

40:36.206 --> 40:39.139
But I want you to know that I have
a family too, you just remember that.

40:41.342 --> 40:42.744
I'll be seeing you again.

41:36.101 --> 41:37.113
Listen up.

41:40.603 --> 41:42.003
We got Westerby in two days.

41:42.153 --> 41:44.715
I know y'all don't want another loss
pinned on your asses.

41:45.360 --> 41:48.060
Quarterbacks and receivers
are gonna be with me today.

41:48.345 --> 41:49.985
Linemen on the boards with Mac.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.276
Any questions?

41:52.969 --> 41:53.969
No, sir.

41:54.323 --> 41:56.049
- What's that?
- No, sir.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.279
- I didn't hear you.
- No, sir!

41:58.429 --> 42:01.203
Let's go. Let's have some fun today.
Let's get out there!
