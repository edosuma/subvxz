Do them again, and do them better.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.160
Our little family,
all together again.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.120
Well, come on then!
Stop it! Stop it!

00:11.560 --> 00:14.440
Tony, you're a disgrace!

00:14.480 --> 00:16.600
I know, I know, don't be a bore.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.640
That's young Tony Travers,
he's her lover.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.360
I'm Roderick Temple. I'm a painter.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.040
I'm a married woman.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.760
The Spirit of Selfridges
is quite the thing.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.880
Doesn't she look ravishing? Your
husband seems to think so anyway.

Although you don't need it.
You look beautiful without.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.640
I'm a showgirl.
It's what people expect.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.400
Hm. How old were you
when you got your first break?

01:19.440 --> 01:21.520
Eighteen.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.640
The leading lady fell ill, and they
pulled me from the Chorus Line.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.040
I was still Joyce then.
Joyce Humphries.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.840
Really?

01:30.880 --> 01:36.720
The director said, "Your dancing's
good, but your name is rotten."

01:36.760 --> 01:39.440
He gave me an hour to come up
with a new one. Ah.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.320
Dad, why aren't you at work?
What's happened?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.440
They sacked me.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.240
You've been drinking.

02:43.280 --> 02:47.440
Let's get you to bed. We'll
talk about this in the morning.

02:47.480 --> 02:51.360
It's alright for you. You've got
a job, Miss Butter wouldn't melt...

02:51.400 --> 02:55.120
in your la-de-da department store.
I don't want to hear this.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.760
Why do you look down
your nose at me?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.800
I've done everything for you.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.120
You've done nothing for me.
I've looked after George.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.200
I didn't always drink.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.920
I don't remember you ever
being sober.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.640
Aggie, I'm sorry. I just got...

Give me a hand with this, sweetheart?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.160
It's a new collar, darn stiff.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.760
Damn horses!

04:16.800 --> 04:19.160
Mr Selfridge. Morning, Mr Selfridge
Morning.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.000
Over here. Over here!

04:21.040 --> 04:22.960
Business going well, Mr Selfridge?
Very.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.240
What are you going to give us after
the Bleriot aeroplane? Wait and see.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.000
You've got to give me
more than that!

04:44.720 --> 04:46.760
I've had an idea.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.360
I wanna move perfume
out of the pharmacy

04:49.400 --> 04:51.200
and give it its own department.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.520
In plain sight? But perfume
is a lady's secret, Mr Selfridge.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.800
Not in France, it isn't.
All the stores give it prominence.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.960
Where would it be, Mr Selfridge?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.680
Right in the front of the store.
The smell of the street is dreadful.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.840
We disguise the god-awful horse
manure, and sell at the same time.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.640
Not on the ground floor?
Amongst accessories and fashion!
It doesn't seem right.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.240
And I was thinking of selling beauty
products right next to the perfume.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.320
Beauty products, on display?!

05:19.360 --> 05:21.160
Did you apply face cream
this morning?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.720
Well yes, but -
And you, Miss Mardle?

05:23.760 --> 05:27.440
Yes, of course. Ponds Cold Cream
is a high-selling product,

05:27.480 --> 05:29.600
yet no-one is buying
from our store.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.400
Why is that?
Ah...

05:31.440 --> 05:33.120
They don't know where it is.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.760
It's hidden with the other
items women use to make
themselves look beautiful.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.400
The Eau de Cologne's next to
the bedpans in the basement,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.400
the hairpieces are
on the fourth floor,

05:41.440 --> 05:44.240
I don't even know where they sell
the hairnets and the combs.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.000
Pharmacy, next to the liver salts.
You see!

05:47.040 --> 05:50.680
If you put it all together
in one department, it's brilliant.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.040
It's a whole new way for women
to shop. I love it!

05:53.120 --> 05:55.640
What about a little make-up as well?

05:55.680 --> 05:58.080
Rouge, lip salve,
that sort of thing.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.320
Women are wearing it now,
out and about.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.440
Not respectable women, surely?
My wife wouldn't touch it!

06:03.480 --> 06:05.920
And I'm sure yours wouldn't
either, Mr Selfridge.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.240
If the customers want it,
we shall give it to them.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.480
Selling make-up above the counter
is making a strong statement.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.880
Perhaps we should explore it
a little further before we decide?

06:14.920 --> 06:17.320
A friend of mine
is over from America.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.440
She works for an advertising
company. Valerie Maurel?

06:20.480 --> 06:24.560
She's great. She'll know all about
this sort of stuff. Get her in
as soon as possible.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.400
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mr Selfridge.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.120
Miss Love is downstairs,
asking to see you.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.240
Excellent. Well, I guess we've
just about covered everything.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.520
But Mr Selfridge?
Meeting adjourned!

06:37.240 --> 06:39.960
Did she say what it's about?
Fur coats, I think.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.080
Mm. She can't choose between
the fox and the beaver.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.240
She's in my department
every other day,

06:49.280 --> 06:53.160
buying up the store on his credit.
People are talking.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.800
They'll talk even more if we start
selling lipstick in broad daylight.
Quite!

06:56.840 --> 06:59.560
We need to lead by example then,
don't we, ladies?

06:59.600 --> 07:01.840
We shouldn't mention
these subjects at all.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.520
Yes of course, Mr Crabb.

Of course it is.
Thank you.

08:49.731 --> 08:52.731
I thought I might buy her
a new dress. Ah.

08:54.971 --> 08:58.411
Harry, you have a mark
on your cheek.

09:04.411 --> 09:08.371
It's a fine thing that Ellen Love
drops into the store and shops, Ma.

09:08.411 --> 09:10.371
She encourages people to buy.

09:10.411 --> 09:14.051
Are you going to use her
to endorse specific products?

09:14.091 --> 09:15.851
I'm thinking about it.

09:15.891 --> 09:19.571
Then it's even more important you
retain a professional relationship
with her.

09:19.611 --> 09:22.731
But you know that... Don't you, son?

09:44.771 --> 09:47.171
Valerie!
Henri!

09:49.331 --> 09:51.171
What do you think?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.091
Lady friend?
Looks like it.

09:55.691 --> 09:57.611
Lucky her.

10:00.051 --> 10:03.811
There you are, madam. Thank you.

10:05.171 --> 10:08.451
Very good to see you again.
And you, Mr Selfridge.

10:08.491 --> 10:12.771
Ah... My apologies for bringing you
all up here again,

10:12.811 --> 10:15.171
but Miss Maurel was too good to miss.

10:15.252 --> 10:16.972
It's not true!

10:17.012 --> 10:18.772
Have a seat, everyone.

10:20.652 --> 10:24.732
Miss Maurel is from the
American advertising agency,

10:24.772 --> 10:27.892
J Walter Thompson. What we're here
to debate, Miss Maurel,

10:27.932 --> 10:32.092
is whether we're going to sell
make-up on our new beauty counters.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.332
Will it bring in
more female customers,

10:34.372 --> 10:36.332
or will it scare them away?

10:37.292 --> 10:39.892
Let us start with powder.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.112
The gentlemen here
will know this product

10:42.130 --> 10:46.290
because your wives' dressing tables
will contain boxes and puffs.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.410
Women and men largely accept it.

10:48.450 --> 10:50.810
We are a modern store.
Powder gets my vote!

10:52.610 --> 10:55.250
Pastel Joue. Colour for the cheeks.

10:55.290 --> 10:58.850
Invented by Bourjois in Paris
for ladies of the stage.

10:58.890 --> 11:04.050
Used by, how do you call it,
ladies of the night as well.

11:04.090 --> 11:07.770
Well, the two aren't necessarily
the same.

11:07.810 --> 11:10.210
It is perceived as risque,
Mr Selfridge.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.330
Lipstick.

11:14.370 --> 11:18.730
Models, artists, film stars,
particularly in Paris,

11:18.770 --> 11:22.610
- are beginning to wear it.
- But London is not Paris!

11:22.650 --> 11:26.050
What do people actually think
of this... lipstick?

11:26.090 --> 11:28.250
In the minds of many,

11:28.290 --> 11:32.490
coloured lips are worn by
prostitutes or suffragettes.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.210
Physiologically,

11:34.250 --> 11:37.610
red lips are an intentional
provocation for the male.

11:37.650 --> 11:40.450
When a woman's aroused,
blood courses through her body,

11:40.490 --> 11:42.650
her lips change colour.

11:42.690 --> 11:46.050
Men have a physical, sexual reaction
to those red lips.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.930
What would selling this product
in the very doorway of the shop

11:48.970 --> 11:50.650
say to our customers?

11:50.690 --> 11:52.450
In London, reputation is everything.

11:52.490 --> 11:54.970
Once lost, it's impossible
to regain.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.050
Am I disturbing you both?

12:44.090 --> 12:46.130
No.
Not at all. Come here!

12:46.170 --> 12:49.090
I don't know what to do
without Violette and Beatrice.

12:49.130 --> 12:52.410
They annoy me when they're here, and
I miss them when they're at school!

12:52.450 --> 12:54.330
You know what I was thinking?

12:54.370 --> 12:58.530
I was thinking we could enrol you
in some sort of Finishing School.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.730
What do you think?
You could meet people...

13:00.770 --> 13:03.610
Or, could I do the Season?

13:06.450 --> 13:09.370
Your father's an American
in commerce, I'm not really...

13:09.410 --> 13:11.650
There's lots of American girls
doing it now.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.730
I think the English have strict
rules about that kind of thing.

13:15.330 --> 13:17.410
There must be a way.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.770
Where've you been?
I'm sorry.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.530
So I'm thinking, right here.

13:33.570 --> 13:36.730
First thing you see when you walk
in - 'Selfridges Beauty Counters'.

13:36.770 --> 13:41.050
The counters must say,
'glamour, women, elegance'.

13:41.090 --> 13:45.970
Good. These accessories will have
to move. Maybe we can put...

13:53.690 --> 13:56.370
Mr Selfridge, where am I going
to put gentlemen's gloves?

13:56.410 --> 13:58.290
A little closer to gentlemen's hats.

13:58.330 --> 14:01.410
Positive thinking.
You'll make it happen, Miss Mardle.

14:01.450 --> 14:05.010
I'm sure we can make space
for gloves in Fashion, Miss Mardle.

14:05.050 --> 14:06.810
I'll see what we can do
in the morning.

14:06.850 --> 14:08.650
That's very kind of you,
Miss Bunting.

14:08.690 --> 14:10.610
We all have to pull together.

14:12.090 --> 14:14.970
The inner workings of the boudoir
for everyone to see.

14:16.810 --> 14:19.250
You think it'll work?
Of course it will!

14:19.290 --> 14:21.690
Women want to make themselves
beautiful for men,

14:21.730 --> 14:23.490
and men want to see how they do it.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.730
We are hopelessly spellbound.

14:30.250 --> 14:33.010
You all right?
Problems with Valerie?

14:33.050 --> 14:35.050
No.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.250
Grab your coat and hat.
I'm taking you out. No.

14:38.290 --> 14:40.050
Come on!
No, I'm tired!

16:01.490 --> 16:03.770
Well, uh...

16:04.810 --> 16:06.810
You have other assets.

16:12.850 --> 16:15.490
And what are your assets?

16:15.530 --> 16:18.970
A window designer?
Well, bravo, Sonny Jim...

16:19.010 --> 16:21.850
Hey! No fighting.
I need both of you too much.

16:21.890 --> 16:25.130
Now, come on,
both of you be friends.

16:34.130 --> 16:35.810
Oh, what have we here?

16:35.850 --> 16:38.850
Ladies and gentlemen,
Harry Selfridge and Ellen Love,

16:38.890 --> 16:40.970
fresh from her theatre triumph!

16:41.010 --> 16:44.090
Jamie, champagne all round.
Let it pour.

16:46.810 --> 16:50.410
Gentlemen, room for one more?
What do you reckon, Tony?

16:50.450 --> 16:54.290
You sure you want to take me on,
Mr Selfridge? The luck's with me.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.770
A quick flutter, why not?
Harry!

16:56.810 --> 16:58.530
Perhaps you should leave it,
old boy.

16:58.570 --> 17:01.650
For all Tony's big talk,
his credit's Lady Mae's.

17:01.690 --> 17:04.930
I don't care who his credit is.
He's at the table, isn't he?

17:05.609 --> 17:08.970
Harry. Don't play, Harry.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.010
You'll be at it all night.

17:11.770 --> 17:13.849
I had other ideas.

17:14.930 --> 17:19.210
I mean it, Harry.
I don't like to wait around.

17:34.490 --> 17:36.490
Petticoat trouble?

17:38.330 --> 17:41.250
Gentlemen, deal me in.

17:47.490 --> 17:50.530
So, not even your charms
can get Harry away from the table?

17:52.530 --> 17:54.330
May I?

18:02.610 --> 18:04.970
You don't like me,
do you, Mr Leclair?

18:06.490 --> 18:09.730
Just because I said your
photographs were no good.

18:11.170 --> 18:14.210
That is one of the reasons
I don't like you, it's true.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.930
There are others?

18:15.970 --> 18:18.930
I think you are, perhaps, trouble.

18:18.970 --> 18:23.170
And Harry, he has always been -
how do you say that,

18:23.210 --> 18:26.970
um... a moth to a flame.

18:31.770 --> 18:34.330
You're very fond of him, aren't you?

18:36.330 --> 18:39.410
Are you one of 'those kind of men'?

18:39.450 --> 18:41.370
I have friends in
the theatre who are -

18:41.410 --> 18:43.610
No, Miss Love. I am not
one of 'those kind of men'.

18:43.650 --> 18:45.410
Then what are you, exactly?

18:46.450 --> 18:48.330
A perfectionist.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.330
But so am I!

18:52.370 --> 18:55.490
Which is why I had to speak out
about the photographs.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.610
They didn't show ME!

19:06.930 --> 19:11.530
I didn't mean to be rude to you.
I just thought...

19:11.570 --> 19:14.370
between you and I,
we could do better.

19:14.410 --> 19:16.410
I see.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.850
I understand what you mean.

19:21.890 --> 19:25.650
Next time, I will let you
choose the poses you want.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.090
Complete freedom.

19:31.530 --> 19:33.770
Sounds like fun.
Yeah?

19:33.810 --> 19:35.850
It's a deal then?

19:52.570 --> 19:55.050
I'll see you.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.570
Straight!

20:04.610 --> 20:06.770
Full House!

20:14.930 --> 20:17.170
You and your damn money, Selfridge!

20:17.210 --> 20:19.450
It's not like you need any more!

20:19.490 --> 20:22.890
First rule of poker, Tony -
lose gracefully.

20:45.450 --> 20:50.570
♪ ..my honey honeysuckle,
I am the bee

20:50.610 --> 20:54.610
♪ I like to sip the honey sweet

20:54.650 --> 20:57.970
♪ From those red lips you see

22:02.562 --> 22:04.242
Hello?

22:04.282 --> 22:06.882
Brought you some breakfast.

22:06.922 --> 22:09.082
Right, wait there.

22:17.816 --> 22:21.536
Er, I've been ill, that's why
I've been off work, so...

22:21.576 --> 22:25.236
These should cheer you up.
Colleano special. Old family recipe.

22:25.263 --> 22:26.983
Made them myself.

22:27.023 --> 22:29.263
Oh. These look good.

22:29.303 --> 22:31.903
Are you walking in?
We could go together.

22:31.943 --> 22:36.303
Er... Erm... I'm sorry, Victor,
I'd love to, but I'm not ready.

22:36.343 --> 22:38.743
Go with George.

22:58.863 --> 23:01.543
Mrs Selfridge, to see Lady Loxley.

23:32.343 --> 23:34.543
What do you think of
our new counters?

23:34.583 --> 23:37.423
They're selling perfume on
counters in Paris, aren't they?

23:37.463 --> 23:39.663
I read it in a trade magazine.

23:42.943 --> 23:46.583
The trouble is, I wouldn't dare
touch any of this.

23:47.783 --> 23:51.863
The bottles look so precious.
And, well, the prices...

23:51.903 --> 23:54.103
Do you wear scent?

23:54.143 --> 23:58.583
Yardley Lavender.
Are you wearing it now?

23:58.623 --> 24:00.583
You're back!

24:05.143 --> 24:08.303
We've got new stock in,
fabulous hats.

24:11.623 --> 24:14.823
Look who's decided to
grace us with her presence!

24:16.583 --> 24:18.263
Ah! It's good to have you back.

24:18.303 --> 24:21.343
I'm surprised you managed to find us
amongst all the powder puffs.

24:21.383 --> 24:23.183
We're lucky she's not in hospital.

24:23.223 --> 24:25.503
Oh, why?
She's got a shiner.

24:25.543 --> 24:27.303
How did that happen, I wonder?

24:29.063 --> 24:31.783
I fainted and hit my cheek
on the bath.

24:57.223 --> 24:59.383
Mrs Selfridge.

24:59.423 --> 25:03.063
It's rather early to visit.
And I've caught you at a busy time.

25:03.103 --> 25:07.183
I'm delighted to receive you. I see
that Pimble has offered refreshment.

25:07.223 --> 25:09.343
Yeah.
Please...

25:14.423 --> 25:16.543
Now, what is it
that I can do for you?

25:16.583 --> 25:18.263
I do so hope there's something.

25:18.303 --> 25:20.983
Well um, as it happens, there is.

25:21.023 --> 25:24.623
Not for me,
it's for my daughter Rosalie.

25:24.749 --> 25:26.909
Erm...

25:28.629 --> 25:31.269
She would like to be presented.

25:31.309 --> 25:33.749
And I have to admit
to being rather at sea.

25:33.789 --> 25:36.229
We don't run to royalty in Chicago.

25:36.269 --> 25:40.389
But how delightful.
And how right you are to come to me.

25:40.429 --> 25:43.429
Harry's shop-keeping associations
are a little difficult,

25:43.469 --> 25:45.389
but I'm sure I could get round it.

25:49.389 --> 25:53.349
Let's start with a tea party.
I could host it here.

25:53.389 --> 25:55.429
Is she pretty?

25:55.469 --> 25:57.269
She's nice looking.

25:57.309 --> 26:01.189
It doesn't really matter.
Everyone will want to come anyway.

26:01.229 --> 26:03.909
You and Harry are much talked about.

26:06.949 --> 26:11.349
Talk is one thing, of course,
gossip is another.

26:11.389 --> 26:15.749
The little matter that we touched
upon last time we met...

26:23.349 --> 26:28.829
In my experience, Harry's interests,
they don't last long.

26:28.869 --> 26:33.869
I found the best way
is just to ignore them entirely.

26:35.109 --> 26:37.829
This 'interest', I hear,
is ambitious.

26:37.869 --> 26:39.789
She's just a chorus girl.

26:39.829 --> 26:42.229
Chorus girls can rise.

26:43.509 --> 26:46.949
I was one of the original
Edwardes company Gaiety Girls.

26:49.869 --> 26:52.069
Don't underestimate the competition.

26:52.109 --> 26:57.069
A little bird tells me,
he's installed Miss Love in a flat.

27:17.309 --> 27:20.029
There are many ways
to wear your perfume.

27:20.069 --> 27:22.829
The particles will fall
onto the skin,

27:22.869 --> 27:26.109
invisible, but aromatic.

27:26.869 --> 27:29.349
Or you can place it on...
They're not buying.

27:29.389 --> 27:32.229
Perfumes are expensive.
These girls don't have the money.

27:32.269 --> 27:34.349
You should develop your own label.

27:34.389 --> 27:37.549
Chemical synthesis means you could
do it quickly and cheaply.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.589
I have a contact here
in a factory in London...

27:40.629 --> 27:42.389
Selfridge's own house scent.

27:42.429 --> 27:45.869
Something exotic and glamorous.
Ellen could endorse it.

27:45.909 --> 27:49.789
Is that a good idea? We could
call it 'Spirit of Selfridges'.

27:49.829 --> 27:51.669
Come work for me here.

27:51.709 --> 27:53.389
New York is the place for me.

27:53.429 --> 27:57.509
I have to go. My boat leaves this
afternoon and I haven't packed.

27:58.549 --> 28:00.789
Very good to see you again,
Mr Selfridge.

28:00.829 --> 28:03.469
Henri.

28:13.229 --> 28:15.269
Valerie.

29:28.029 --> 29:30.469
Mrs Buckingham!

29:36.509 --> 29:39.749
You must think me very forward,
turning up like this.

29:41.069 --> 29:43.389
You don't know how happy I am
that you have.

29:43.429 --> 29:46.869
Thank you. I've been positively
haunting the National Gallery,

29:46.909 --> 29:48.789
hoping you'd come back.

29:52.189 --> 29:55.509
Can I ask, why the change of heart?

29:56.669 --> 29:59.589
Oh, I just came on an impulse.

30:01.509 --> 30:06.469
And it was rude of me to leave
when you were showing me your work.

30:07.549 --> 30:09.789
What are you working on
at the moment?

30:09.829 --> 30:12.109
Erm... this.

30:19.669 --> 30:24.029
Oh, it's very good.

30:24.069 --> 30:25.829
No, it's more than good.

30:25.869 --> 30:28.069
I love it.

30:29.149 --> 30:31.149
Thank you

30:31.829 --> 30:35.429
I, erm...
I much prefer painting people.

30:35.469 --> 30:38.109
Oh?

30:39.149 --> 30:41.029
Why don't you paint me?

31:31.069 --> 31:34.269
I have been looking for you,
and I find you hidden away here.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.789
Sorry, Mr Leclair! I was just -

31:36.829 --> 31:38.749
You are wasted amongst these boxes.

31:38.789 --> 31:41.149
I have a proposition for you.
Come along.

31:46.269 --> 31:49.469
Mr Selfridge wants to develop
a house perfume.

31:49.509 --> 31:51.869
I think the new Selfridge
house perfume

31:51.909 --> 31:53.589
should appeal to every girl,

31:53.629 --> 31:57.389
not just the highborn lady
or the glamorous actress.

31:57.429 --> 32:01.029
It should be simple,
fresh and natural.

32:01.069 --> 32:04.749
In short, Miss Towler,
it should appeal to you.

32:06.389 --> 32:08.069
Me?
Um-hm.

32:08.709 --> 32:11.309
Will you help me work out
what it should be?

32:13.589 --> 32:15.709
I've got a new idea for the store.

32:15.749 --> 32:18.749
We're going to be doing
our own in-house perfume,

32:18.789 --> 32:20.909
and I want you to endorse it.

32:22.589 --> 32:24.709
Like the French opera singer, Calve!

32:24.749 --> 32:27.709
She always wore Guerlain.
Oh, darling, that's wonderful!

32:27.749 --> 32:30.229
This is not gonna be like
the grand French scents.

32:30.269 --> 32:33.349
Chemical developments
are changing the market.

32:33.389 --> 32:35.069
We're gonna make it inexpensive.

32:35.909 --> 32:37.829
Cheap, you mean?
No...

32:37.869 --> 32:39.669
great value.

32:39.709 --> 32:43.189
Your face will be on every woman's
dressing table in England.

32:43.229 --> 32:46.309
Next to the smelling salts
and the foot powder.

32:47.389 --> 32:49.069
No thanks.

32:58.669 --> 33:01.749
We're gonna be doing
a big in-house promotion.

33:02.829 --> 33:06.469
Perfume gets a window. Whoever
endorses it, will be a part of that.

33:06.509 --> 33:09.749
But of course,
if you're not interested...

33:10.469 --> 33:12.309
A window...

33:17.069 --> 33:19.469
Oh Harry, I'd love to!

33:29.989 --> 33:31.669
Mother!
Sweetheart!

33:31.709 --> 33:34.589
I've been waiting for you!
I've such wonderful news for you!

33:34.629 --> 33:36.389
I know! Lady Mae's going to help us.

33:36.429 --> 33:40.589
She dropped in half an hour ago.
It's so exciting. She told you?

33:40.629 --> 33:44.109
We've already started planning
events. She's wonderful.

33:44.989 --> 33:47.669
Can you believe it?
I am going to meet the king!

33:47.709 --> 33:49.709
You are a lucky girl.

34:03.749 --> 34:05.749
You're drunk.

34:08.589 --> 34:10.469
Only a little.

34:12.469 --> 34:15.708
You've been avoiding me. Why?

34:20.268 --> 34:24.149
I've, erm, lost a bit of money.

34:27.349 --> 34:29.268
My money?

34:32.268 --> 34:34.549
The other night, I was on a roll...

34:35.829 --> 34:38.789
..then he turned up!
Who?

34:40.109 --> 34:44.629
That vile American friend
of yours, Harry Selfridge.

34:53.516 --> 34:55.516
Hurry up, George.
Sorry, Alf!

34:55.556 --> 35:00.556
Hey, George. Agnes not come in
today? She came in early.

35:00.596 --> 35:02.936
I haven't seen her
these past couple of days.

35:02.988 --> 35:04.668
She's been taken off the floor,

35:04.708 --> 35:06.908
special assignment
for the Art Department.

35:06.948 --> 35:09.428
'Mr Leclair this, Mr Leclair that.'

35:09.468 --> 35:11.428
She can't stop talking about it!

35:11.468 --> 35:13.668
My sister's going to get on.

35:15.348 --> 35:18.348
See them boxes?
Stick 'em in that van!

35:19.508 --> 35:21.828
My mother loved these.

35:21.868 --> 35:25.108
We picked them
when we went to the countryside.

35:26.108 --> 35:28.428
Maybe that's why
you thought of them.

35:28.468 --> 35:30.628
It was very clever of you.

35:33.268 --> 35:36.348
In France, they are sold in the
streets on the first day of May.

35:36.388 --> 35:38.428
Young lovers give them
to each other.

35:43.068 --> 35:47.588
That lady, who came to the store
and was so beautifully dressed,

35:47.628 --> 35:50.348
is she a friend of yours?

35:51.668 --> 35:54.588
We've known each other
since we were children.

35:56.228 --> 36:00.148
I asked her to marry me.

36:00.188 --> 36:02.588
She said 'no'.

36:03.908 --> 36:05.788
I'm sorry.

36:07.268 --> 36:09.108
So am I.

36:12.468 --> 36:15.388
When are you going to show
the designs to Mr Selfridge?

36:16.628 --> 36:18.308
Soon.

36:18.348 --> 36:21.468
I have a little matter
I need to settle first.

36:27.188 --> 36:30.308
Lady Loxley is in the
Palm Court, Mr Selfridge.

36:30.348 --> 36:32.428
She wants to see you.

36:38.788 --> 36:42.708
Lady Mae. A delight to see you,
as always. How are you?

36:43.828 --> 36:47.748
Feeling lonely, having argued with
Tony over a large gambling debt.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.988
Oh, you know how it is,
boys will be boys.

36:50.028 --> 36:53.188
No, Harry, I don't. I'm not
a member of your estimable sex.

36:53.228 --> 36:54.908
It was a game. He lost, I won.

36:54.948 --> 36:56.628
I found a backer for you.

36:56.668 --> 36:59.308
I'm helping your eldest daughter
into Society,

36:59.348 --> 37:01.188
and this is how you repay me.

37:01.228 --> 37:03.988
I won't be made a fool of.
How are you helping Rosalie?

37:04.028 --> 37:06.908
Haven't you talked
to Mrs Selfridge recently?

37:08.188 --> 37:10.508
No, too busy hanging
around the Gaiety?

37:10.548 --> 37:12.588
I thought you had better
judgment than that.

37:12.628 --> 37:14.348
My judgment is just fine.

37:14.388 --> 37:17.188
Then it's time I asked for a favour.

37:20.468 --> 37:22.468
Cast your eye over this.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.788
Utter nonsense, of course.

37:25.828 --> 37:29.188
Suffrage women are some of
the most elegant women I know.

37:29.228 --> 37:31.108
So you support Suffrage?

37:31.148 --> 37:34.628
I live in a house of women.
I have no choice! What can I do?

37:34.668 --> 37:37.068
Actively endorse The Cause.

37:37.988 --> 37:39.908
Sell our memorabilia.

37:42.268 --> 37:46.028
These are Mrs Pankhurst's colours.
Doesn't she advocate violence?

37:46.068 --> 37:47.828
Only as a last resort,

37:47.868 --> 37:50.908
when the men who oppose her
are particularly intransigent.

37:50.948 --> 37:53.228
I would like a table reserved
in this restaurant,

37:53.268 --> 37:56.628
every Tuesday lunchtime, for
the London Branch of the movement.

37:57.428 --> 37:59.108
I would be honoured.

37:59.628 --> 38:01.628
I thought you would.

38:01.668 --> 38:07.628
Mr Colleano. Lady Loxley is requiring
a large table every Tuesday.

38:07.668 --> 38:09.468
Yes, Mr Selfridge.

38:12.588 --> 38:15.068
Who knows, you may have
done me a favour.

38:15.108 --> 38:18.588
I'm rather bored with Tony, and
there are other fish in the sea.

38:28.348 --> 38:31.068
No, no, this is not right.

38:32.348 --> 38:35.468
This is not - as you said -
the essence of you.

38:35.508 --> 38:37.468
Send everyone away.

38:37.508 --> 38:39.428
Please.

38:42.708 --> 38:45.388
You have something in mind?
I do.

38:52.668 --> 38:54.388
Better?
Much!

38:59.388 --> 39:01.108
Don't move!

39:03.668 --> 39:06.028
This is perfect.

39:06.068 --> 39:08.108
You look wonderful.

39:09.108 --> 39:11.028
Ready?

39:11.068 --> 39:14.828
Great! And now we need to
go closer on your face.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.908
Play Miss Love.
Play anything that comes to mind.

39:22.948 --> 39:25.628
You?
I need a steady hand.

39:26.668 --> 39:28.428
Or I will not do you justice.

39:34.108 --> 39:35.948
I love it!

39:36.628 --> 39:38.308
How about this?

39:54.708 --> 39:56.388
What have you got for me?

39:56.428 --> 39:58.148
Oh Harry, they're wonderful.

39:59.388 --> 40:03.628
They are a little experimental,
but this is Miss Love's vision.

40:08.188 --> 40:10.028
This...

40:11.188 --> 40:13.108
And this.

40:16.668 --> 40:18.548
And this.

40:18.588 --> 40:20.588
I love this one.
Me too!

40:24.948 --> 40:27.148
We can't use them.
We're a family store.

40:27.188 --> 40:30.668
Harry, don't you think
I look beautiful?

40:30.708 --> 40:34.188
Very beautiful.
Well then, why can't we use them?

40:34.228 --> 40:36.628
I need to speak to Mr Leclair.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.228
Miss Blenkinsop will arrange
a hansom cab for you.

40:41.468 --> 40:44.628
But I thought we were having lunch.
Not today.

41:08.388 --> 41:10.708
You're a ruthless bastard, Henri.

41:10.748 --> 41:13.428
If you don't like them,
I do have something else.

41:15.428 --> 41:18.668
It's a very different feel...

41:18.708 --> 41:22.388
simple, pure, floral.

41:24.828 --> 41:26.788
Lily of the Valley.

41:27.508 --> 41:29.988
It's natural, but appealing.

41:32.348 --> 41:34.148
See...

41:34.188 --> 41:39.228
It says to us -
childhood, springtime, first love.

41:43.588 --> 41:47.388
Unforgettable.
'Unforgettable' is a fine strap
line.

41:47.428 --> 41:49.988
And I like the white
against the green.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.868
Do you like it?

42:10.908 --> 42:13.148
I... I love it.

42:15.028 --> 42:17.788
This is your window.

42:21.028 --> 42:23.068
I won't forget the help you gave me.

42:37.988 --> 42:41.108
♪ If you're
a pink pyjama girlie

42:41.148 --> 42:44.228
♪ You'll always be alrighty

42:46.108 --> 42:50.188
♪ And you'll never wear
a nightie

42:51.308 --> 42:53.708
♪ Anymore ♪

42:59.428 --> 43:01.988
Our house perfume
is doubling in sale every day.

43:02.028 --> 43:04.268
I bet that gives you
a warm feeling inside.

43:07.108 --> 43:11.908
May I ask, Mr Selfridge, what is
your present thinking on make-up?

43:13.348 --> 43:15.508
We'll stock powder and rouge,
lipstick too...

43:15.548 --> 43:17.828
but under the counter
and discreetly.

43:17.868 --> 43:20.628
Make up is not how we want
to define ourselves.

43:20.668 --> 43:22.668
I can't say that I'm not pleased.

43:22.708 --> 43:24.548
Mrs Crabb wouldn't have liked it.

43:24.588 --> 43:26.468
Nor would Mrs Selfridge.

43:26.508 --> 43:28.748
Speaking of wives,
time to get back to them.

43:29.668 --> 43:32.428
Good night, Crabb.
Good night, Mr Selfridge.

43:40.028 --> 43:44.508
Your pose isn't right.
Oh.

43:44.548 --> 43:46.308
You're not the sort of woman
who sits.

43:46.348 --> 43:48.348
You need to be doing something.

43:50.828 --> 43:53.268
What about, erm...

43:54.628 --> 43:56.588
..this?

43:56.628 --> 43:58.668
No.

44:02.468 --> 44:04.348
I've got it!

44:19.508 --> 44:21.548
Pa's home!

44:23.268 --> 44:26.588
You're home early!
Yeah, I miss my family.

44:28.588 --> 44:30.308
Where's Rose?

44:52.228 --> 44:53.948
You hold that pose.

45:01.428 --> 45:05.748
I've never seen you so enchanted.
What struck you so?

45:05.788 --> 45:08.548
Every woman should have
a Pavlova moment like this.

45:08.588 --> 45:10.988
You knew I was falling in love
with you!

45:11.028 --> 45:13.468
Dad!
Get that drunk out of our store!

45:13.508 --> 45:17.148
Anna Pavlova is visiting Selfridge's
today. I have to be there!

45:20.084 --> 45:21.466
Mr Selfridge.
