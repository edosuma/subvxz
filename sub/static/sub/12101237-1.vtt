13:03.103 --> 13:07.448
- Um, I like everything
you said, but...why not you?

13:07.482 --> 13:09.241
- Because I have
a full schedule.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.068
- Okay.

13:12.344 --> 13:14.068
- It was great seeing you,
Kevin.

13:15.793 --> 13:18.931
- Okay. You too, Jasmine.

13:29.172 --> 13:30.413
- YOUNG JASMINE: I feel bad you
didn't go celebrate

13:30.413 --> 13:31.931
with your team.

13:31.965 --> 13:33.931
We could've went,
I don't mind.

13:36.103 --> 13:39.448
To you. After another
great game and for being

13:39.482 --> 13:42.310
so highly recruited as a junior.

13:42.344 --> 13:45.310
I'm really happy for you.
- Thank you.

13:45.344 --> 13:47.448
- I colored it and everything
for you.

13:47.482 --> 13:48.551
- [chuckles] I see that.

13:48.551 --> 13:51.310
I actually might keep this one.
- You better!

13:51.344 --> 13:52.896
- BOTH: [laughing]

13:52.931 --> 13:55.068
- Ah, thank you, though,
I like it.

13:56.482 --> 13:58.931
What's up with these records,
though?

13:58.965 --> 14:02.034
- Yeah, I love collecting.
- TLC.

14:02.655 --> 14:04.310
- Mm-hmm.
- How d'you know about them?

14:04.344 --> 14:08.344
- They're my favorite.
- Yeah. That's what's up.

14:08.379 --> 14:12.413
No hip-hop, though.
- Nope. No hip-hop.

14:12.482 --> 14:14.241
One day, I'm gonna meet
each of them

14:14.310 --> 14:16.310
and have them personally
autographed.

14:16.551 --> 14:20.517
- Mm, I mean, if you ask me
personally,

14:20.551 --> 14:25.344
I think you're doper than
all these artists. I'm serious.

14:25.379 --> 14:29.068
And one day...when you go
big and famous,

14:29.137 --> 14:32.137
I want front-row seats
to every one.

14:32.689 --> 14:34.862
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

14:34.862 --> 14:38.310
- And you got my word. [laughs]
- Alright then. [chuckles]

14:40.551 --> 14:44.482
I'm curious, though, why do you
go to school so far away?

14:45.482 --> 14:49.827
I mean, you're the only person
I know that lives in Inglewood

14:49.862 --> 14:52.344
but goes to school all the way
in Santa Monica.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.172
- Well, you can thank
my parents for that.

14:55.068 --> 14:58.517
They just...never really
liked this area very much.

14:58.551 --> 15:00.517
The only reason I live here is
because they're away on duty

15:00.965 --> 15:03.965
and my Auntie Addis lives here.
- Addis.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.931
- They feel Santa Monica
Catholic Prep gives me

15:05.965 --> 15:08.482
a better opportunity,
especially for singing.

15:08.551 --> 15:11.206
- I mean, it does make sense.
- Can I ask you something?

15:11.551 --> 15:13.103
- What's up?

15:14.586 --> 15:18.034
- Out of all the girls
at your school, why me?

15:19.517 --> 15:20.551
- You're unique.

15:21.448 --> 15:23.068
And...

15:23.896 --> 15:27.275
Nobody else had
a voice like yours.

15:29.275 --> 15:30.275
- But...

15:32.206 --> 15:36.137
Am I pretty?
- Are you pretty? Really?

15:36.206 --> 15:37.137
Really?!
- [laughs]

15:37.206 --> 15:39.137
- Come here, give me some.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.586
Yeah, you're pretty.

You wanna work here?

- I feel so violated right now.

20:56.586 --> 21:00.137
- All of that, but Boss Man
is looking fine, okay?

21:00.172 --> 21:02.241
- Oh, my God, but his wife's
still on Similac.

21:02.275 --> 21:05.206

yes,
but he's cute.

21:05.241 --> 21:07.551
- Jasmine, I need you
to relax tonight.

21:07.586 --> 21:09.724

Thank you very much.

46:28.793 --> 46:31.551
- Congratulations.
- Appreciate that. Mm-hmm.

46:32.827 --> 46:35.758
So, what's up with you,
you married?

46:35.793 --> 46:38.413
- Was engaged but it didn't
work out.

46:38.448 --> 46:41.413
- Sorry to hear that.
- No big deal.

46:41.448 --> 46:42.482
- So I've been trying
to figure this out,

46:42.551 --> 46:45.827
are you a sports agent
for basketball, football,

46:45.862 --> 46:49.758
baseball, soccer,
what you doing? [laughs]

46:49.793 --> 46:52.413
- I actually wouldn't say
all that, you know,

46:52.448 --> 46:55.448
I kinda got thrown into
my situation.

46:55.448 --> 46:58.586
- Ah. Got it.
- Yeah, um, got my first client.

46:58.620 --> 47:03.310
- Ooh, bravo to you.
- After college, I...

47:03.344 --> 47:05.310
played Canadian football
for five years,

47:05.344 --> 47:07.344
and then I started coaching
and...

47:07.379 --> 47:11.689
- Wow. [laughs]
- Here I am. [chuckles]

47:11.724 --> 47:13.862
- Okay, that's some
journey, Kev.

47:13.896 --> 47:16.379
- Yeah, well, the best part
of the journey is,

47:16.413 --> 47:19.517
what can I say?
Being on the West Coast.

47:19.551 --> 47:20.068
- Ah.
- 'Cause...

47:20.586 --> 47:23.344
the East Coast weather...
- I hate snow.

47:23.379 --> 47:24.655
- Yeah.
- I like to hibernate

47:24.689 --> 47:26.827
in the wintertime.
- You can love it sometimes,

47:26.862 --> 47:28.689
it all depends.
- [chuckles]

47:28.724 --> 47:31.517
Yeah, everything depends.
- [laughs]

47:31.551 --> 47:33.655
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

47:34.827 --> 47:35.448
[clicks tongue]

47:36.689 --> 47:41.689
- [laughs] Wow.

47:41.724 --> 47:44.379
- It's nice.
- It's very nice.

47:47.310 --> 47:49.724
- [laughing]
- I mean, it was nice,

47:49.793 --> 47:51.034
but it was kind of weird,

47:51.068 --> 47:52.724
'cause it was like
being in high school again.

47:52.724 --> 47:55.965
- [humming]
- Aw, that's sweet.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.034
- Very sweet.
- Okay.

47:57.068 --> 47:59.172
- Very sweet.
- He's a sports agent.

47:59.206 --> 48:02.103
- He's a sports agent, yes.
- Is he single?

48:02.103 --> 48:04.896
- He's off the market, Briana.
- Oh, bummer.

48:04.931 --> 48:08.172
- [giggling]
- Here you go, ladies.

48:09.275 --> 48:13.103
- Oh, my.
My, my, my, my.

48:13.137 --> 48:16.931
Hmm. I'm next. [clears throat]
Thank you, darling.

48:18.275 --> 48:20.379
- And the cookies will be
done in ten.

48:20.413 --> 48:23.103
- SONYA: Thank you, baby.
- Anything for you.

48:23.758 --> 48:29.275
- JASMINE: Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm!
What you been doing, Sonya?!

48:29.275 --> 48:31.896
- Where did you find him?!
- My gosh, I was sittin' here

48:31.931 --> 48:34.206
thinking the same thing,
what's up?

48:34.241 --> 48:36.241
- You know, he is a keeper,
isn't he?

48:36.275 --> 48:38.931
- JASMINE: Girl.
- A girl at work introduced us,

48:38.965 --> 48:40.206
and get this.
- JASMINE: Mm-hmm.

48:40.241 --> 48:42.379
- He's studying to become
a pastor.

48:42.413 --> 48:44.413
- Okay, okay, so he wanna
be a pastor.

48:44.413 --> 48:45.000
- SONYA: Mm-hmm.

48:45.448 --> 48:46.931
- Have you been
to the mountaintop?!

48:46.965 --> 48:50.448
[screams, laughs]
- [laughing]

48:50.482 --> 48:53.448
- Have you been?
- SONYA: [laughing]

48:53.448 --> 48:54.931
- Okay, yeah, uh,
how are things working

48:54.931 --> 48:59.413
in the sex department?
- Um, you know what?

48:59.448 --> 49:02.172
We're working on that.

49:02.172 --> 49:03.206
You know,
I'm still breaking him in.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.827
- Breaking him in or breaking
him also?

49:04.862 --> 49:08.172
- BRIANA: [laughs]
- [teasing laugh]

49:08.172 --> 49:11.793
- Hey! [laughing]
Okay, okay, well,

49:11.827 --> 49:13.275
how long have you known him?

49:13.310 --> 49:15.000
And why haven't you told us
about him?

49:15.034 --> 49:16.931
You tell us about
every other guy.

49:16.965 --> 49:17.827
- 'Cause I didn't wanna
jinx it,

49:17.862 --> 49:19.827
and you know you talk too much.

49:19.862 --> 49:21.413
- Hmm, you do talk
too much, Bri.

49:22.103 --> 49:24.862
- We've been taking it slow,
he's a keeper,

49:24.896 --> 49:27.275
we only just now started
discussing, like,

49:27.310 --> 49:30.379
being exclusive.
- Okay, I respect that.

49:30.448 --> 49:34.103
- It's only been nine months.
- [coughs] And no sex?!

49:34.137 --> 49:36.793
Oh, no!
- Is that all you think about?

49:36.827 --> 49:39.862
- Uh, yes!
- Sonya. Girl--

49:39.896 --> 49:43.517
- Stop it. He wants
to do things God's way, okay?

49:43.517 --> 49:45.517
He wants to develop a more
emotional,

49:45.517 --> 49:48.172
spiritual connection first.

49:48.172 --> 49:50.034
- Mm-mm, he gotta go.

49:50.103 --> 49:51.827
- Girl, you better make
some contact.

49:51.862 --> 49:54.517
Connection, contact.
- Yeah, test it out.

49:54.517 --> 49:57.379
- And you know what?
That's why you're single.

49:57.448 --> 49:59.482
- But I'm relaxed.
- Single.

50:00.862 --> 50:06.344
- Mm. This is so good.
- Ah. So.

50:06.344 --> 50:11.172
Tell me about your husband.
- BOTH: [laughing]

50:11.172 --> 50:14.172
- Besides the obvious
successful businessman.

50:14.172 --> 50:17.172
- Well, there isn't much to say.

50:17.172 --> 50:21.000
Not good anyway. [laughs]
- Wow.

50:21.034 --> 50:23.413
- Are we really gonna do this?
- Yes. Really are.

50:25.862 --> 50:28.448
- Well, after my mom died,

50:28.482 --> 50:30.517
on the same day that what
happened between us happened,

50:30.551 --> 50:33.793
I was...very messed up.

50:35.172 --> 50:37.172
I knew there was no way
that I could survive

50:37.172 --> 50:40.000
that kind of pain again,
so I closed myself off

50:40.034 --> 50:44.206
to pretty much everyone,
buried myself in work,

50:44.275 --> 50:47.172
and did my damndest
to succeed at everything I could

50:47.172 --> 50:49.137
to make Daddy happy again.

50:49.931 --> 50:53.379
But in the process,
I lost myself.

50:53.448 --> 50:56.482
Could never quite reconnect
with that positive dreamer

50:56.482 --> 50:58.862
I used to be.

50:58.896 --> 51:02.448
Kevin, do you remember how much
I loved music and singing?

51:02.517 --> 51:05.448
- I sure do. [chuckles]

51:05.517 --> 51:06.931
- Well, I just found out
the other day that my husband

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
had no idea.
- What?

51:09.034 --> 51:12.275
- Yeah, he had no idea
and he also didn't care.

51:12.344 --> 51:14.620
- What? Like, where did
this come from?

51:14.689 --> 51:19.241
- I don't know, but come on,
I knew the man I was marrying.

51:19.241 --> 51:22.448
You know, Robert is the kind
of guy who loves a challenge.

51:22.517 --> 51:25.275
And for years I think he saw me
as some sort of mystery.

51:25.344 --> 51:27.517
I don't know, figure out
how to crack the code

51:27.551 --> 51:31.000
and get beneath the surface,
and I never let him in.

51:31.034 --> 51:35.000
He gave up and now we're more
like...roommates

51:35.034 --> 51:37.413
than husband and wife.
- Mm-mm-mm.

51:37.413 --> 51:38.620
Roommates?
- Mm-hmm.

51:38.689 --> 51:41.068
- [laughs]
- Yeah, if I'm gonna compare it

51:41.103 --> 51:44.000
to something, I would say
were're roommates, and--

51:44.034 --> 51:46.241
- That's funny.
- That's very pathetic.

51:46.241 --> 51:49.551
- You good with me. You good.
That's... [laughs]

51:50.551 --> 51:53.172
Wow. [laughs]

51:53.206 --> 51:55.206
- Oh, my gosh!
Okay, enough of my drama.

51:55.241 --> 51:58.000
What's yours? What's--what's up
with you?

51:58.034 --> 52:00.586
- Oh. Mine?
- Mm-hmm.

52:00.586 --> 52:05.655
- Well. Me and Gabrielle,
we--we met in Toronto

52:05.655 --> 52:10.137
after one of my games and...
everything was great with us.

52:10.137 --> 52:13.103
And me, you know?
Until the injuries started

52:13.137 --> 52:17.310
piling up and then, finally,
after five average seasons,

52:17.310 --> 52:21.517
I was like, "I'm done with this.
I'm done," you know?

52:21.586 --> 52:23.620
And I give her some credit,
you know,

52:23.655 --> 52:26.482
she tried to stick about while
I dibbled and dabbled

52:26.482 --> 52:30.344
into the coaching thing,
but that wasn't her thing, so...

52:30.413 --> 52:34.586
mm, she started sneaking around
with one of my former teammates.

52:34.620 --> 52:37.137
[chuckles]
- What a cunt.

52:37.172 --> 52:40.310
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

52:40.310 --> 52:42.620
- Big one.
- And I'm not sorry I said that.

52:42.655 --> 52:46.000
- Oh, it's all good.
It's all good.

52:46.000 --> 52:51.482
The good thing is...
me and you talking again.

52:51.517 --> 52:53.551
- This is kinda nice, isn't it?

52:53.586 --> 52:56.241
[laughs]

52:56.275 --> 52:59.103
Oh, do you remember
after school,

52:59.137 --> 53:02.206
how we'd meet at the park
and we'd sit on the bench

53:02.241 --> 53:04.034
and you would tell me about
your day

53:04.068 --> 53:06.241
and I would tell you about mine.
- My days was never good.

53:06.310 --> 53:10.068
- [laughing]
- Well, mine sucked

53:10.137 --> 53:12.413
'cause everybody teased me.
- No, it's okay.

53:12.482 --> 53:16.655
We was kids, you know.
- Why are kids so mean?

53:16.689 --> 53:20.034
- No filters.
- [laughing]

53:20.068 --> 53:21.551
- Right?
- Filters?

53:21.586 --> 53:25.517
- No filter, they just go.
Just go with the flow.

53:25.551 --> 53:27.034
- [laughs] Hmm.

53:28.206 --> 53:29.517
- Hey, um...

53:29.551 --> 53:31.034
- Hmm? [chuckles]

53:32.172 --> 53:33.034
- [chuckles]

53:40.551 --> 53:43.068
- I'm sorry about that.

53:43.137 --> 53:45.689
I didn't mean to,
I'm very sorry.

No excuses, make it happen.

54:56.793 --> 55:00.827
- SONYA: Girl you did what?
He kissed you?

55:00.827 --> 55:03.655
- Hmm.
- Good job, ladies.

55:07.206 --> 55:09.862
- Wait, that's all y'all did,
right?

55:09.931 --> 55:11.344
- Well...

55:11.344 --> 55:15.344
- Yes, ma'am.
- You had sex too?!

55:15.413 --> 55:18.137
Oh, you slut!

55:18.172 --> 55:20.344
Well?
- Well what?

55:20.413 --> 55:22.586
- Was it good?

55:24.862 --> 55:28.172
- Oh, my God,
it was amazing! [laughs]

55:28.172 --> 55:31.275
- [squeaks, laughs]

55:31.310 --> 55:33.517
- It was so intense,
but still, he was gentle

55:33.517 --> 55:36.862
and romantic...
- Damn, girl, stop gushing.

55:36.896 --> 55:40.551
- Jasmine, that was totally
not cool, what about Robert?

55:40.620 --> 55:43.689
- God, don't you think I feel
horrible about that?

55:43.724 --> 55:47.172
But... [sighs] We haven't
been happy in years, alright?

55:47.206 --> 55:49.344
And I was the one who was
stupid enough to think

55:49.379 --> 55:51.344
that moving back here was
gonna change anything,

55:51.344 --> 55:53.137
but it's only gotten worse.

55:53.172 --> 55:55.310
- Yeah, Jasmine,
but you are still married.

55:55.344 --> 55:57.172
You know you have to honor that.

55:57.206 --> 55:59.344
- Don't be such
a buzzkill, okay?

55:59.379 --> 56:02.586
If the girl wants to have
a little fun, let her.

56:02.586 --> 56:04.551
We know he's had plenty of it.

56:04.586 --> 56:07.344
- Oh, don't you even go there,
girl, look.

56:07.379 --> 56:10.931
This guy isn't even trying
to hide it anymore.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.241
- Mm-mm, girl,
you're better than me.

56:13.275 --> 56:16.275
- Okay, what is with all this
foreplay on the mat?

56:16.344 --> 56:19.586
- Seriously.
- JASMINE: [laughs]

56:19.655 --> 56:21.344
What's up with that?

56:21.379 --> 56:22.620
Um. [clears throat] Excuse me.

56:22.689 --> 56:26.344
- Yeah, um, hello? Hi.
[exhales]

56:26.379 --> 56:27.620
- Five more minutes.
- Five more--?

56:27.689 --> 56:29.448
- INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.
- [exhales]

56:29.517 --> 56:33.344
Damn, does he even know
we exist over here?

56:33.379 --> 56:35.413
- [exhales] Oh, my God,
did you--?

56:35.482 --> 56:39.413
- [laughing]

56:39.413 --> 56:41.517
- BRIANA: He is fine, okay?

56:41.551 --> 56:43.655
And I am single!

56:44.241 --> 56:46.517
How else you think we get
such cheap rates?

56:46.551 --> 56:48.344
- Briana, you are so bad.
[laughs]

56:48.379 --> 56:50.586
- I'm sorry.
- Girl.

56:50.586 --> 56:53.344
We about to get the whole
year for free.

56:53.379 --> 56:54.689
- [laughing]

56:54.724 --> 57:01.482
-

57:01.482 --> 57:02.965
- You know, God gave us
ten commandments.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.482
- [agreeing]

57:04.482 --> 57:06.793
- But he broke it down
into two.

57:06.827 --> 57:11.448
He said love God
with your heart, soul and mind.

57:11.482 --> 57:13.482
Second he gave us,
love your neighbor

57:13.482 --> 57:16.655
as you love yourself.

57:16.655 --> 57:20.344
You got to love yourself
before you love your neighbors.

1:22:32.379 --> 1:22:34.103
I had to park four blocks away.

1:22:34.137 --> 1:22:35.551
- That's why we should've
Ubered.

1:22:35.551 --> 1:22:37.206
- You're right.
- The last time I drove,

1:22:37.206 --> 1:22:39.379
the deacon's wife
cursed me out

1:22:39.379 --> 1:22:42.896
and threatened to kick my a--
my behind all over the place

1:22:42.931 --> 1:22:44.551
until she realized
we were from the same church.

1:22:44.551 --> 1:22:46.275
- Wait, wait, that's the same
lady who has

1:22:46.310 --> 1:22:48.275
a "Jesus is my driver" sticker
on the car, right?

1:22:48.310 --> 1:22:51.379
- Yeah, so I roll down
the window and I said to her,

1:22:51.413 --> 1:22:53.275
"Jesus ain't got the wheel
today!"

1:22:53.310 --> 1:22:56.137
- [laughing]
- You still don't know it, man.

1:22:56.206 --> 1:22:58.275
- Would y'all leave
that woman alone?

1:22:58.310 --> 1:23:00.413
-Look baby, it's funny, it's
like,
if you see it,

1:23:00.448 --> 1:23:03.103
you would laugh too,
I promise you'd really laugh.

1:23:03.137 --> 1:23:06.137
It's just hilarious, like...
- Yeah? Oh. Ow.

1:23:06.172 --> 1:23:07.310
- What's wrong?
- [nervous laugh]

1:23:07.379 --> 1:23:12.034
That little guy's trying
to kick his way out. Ow.

1:23:12.068 --> 1:23:16.620
- Okay, now, now, listen, Son,

1:23:16.620 --> 1:23:19.448

a big day.
