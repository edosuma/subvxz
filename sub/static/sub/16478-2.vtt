The DOJ just wants us

that there's nothing
to worry about.

Homeland Security Agent
John Russo was a double agent

02:29.699 --> 02:31.765
working for
the Ciudad Natal Cartel?

02:33.168 --> 02:34.368
That's correct.

02:34.370 --> 02:35.969
And can you tell me
why you chose

02:35.971 --> 02:37.705
to break procedure and neglect

02:37.707 --> 02:41.041
to report Russo immediately
to his superiors or your own?

02:48.250 --> 02:49.850
Four NCIS agents
responsible for multiple...

02:49.852 --> 02:51.417
How long they been up there?

02:51.419 --> 02:52.853
Not long.

02:54.489 --> 02:55.822
What do you hear?

02:55.824 --> 02:58.491
Well, right now,
just you.

03:01.196 --> 03:03.229
We discover Russo's
a double agent,

03:03.231 --> 03:04.631
we bring him down,

03:04.633 --> 03:06.932
and now we're the ones
under review.

03:06.934 --> 03:09.469
Yeah, it's called
government work.

03:09.471 --> 03:11.003
Still, looks like Pride is...

03:11.005 --> 03:12.639
SONJA and LASALLE:
...pretty upset.

03:15.009 --> 03:16.008
They need their privacy.

03:16.010 --> 03:17.109
Yeah, we got work to do,

03:17.111 --> 03:18.677
like answering
that phone call.

03:18.679 --> 03:20.479
You don't think
that I should be here.

03:20.481 --> 03:21.647
I get it.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.448
In your estimation,
you're heroes

03:23.450 --> 03:25.184
and we should just
thank you and move on.

03:25.186 --> 03:26.218
That'd be nice.

03:26.220 --> 03:27.787
Look at it from my perspective.

03:27.789 --> 03:30.756
A mole in Homeland Security
at the highest level.

03:30.758 --> 03:33.659
A major attack on your city,
barely stopped.

03:33.661 --> 03:35.394
By my team.
Yes.

03:35.396 --> 03:36.995
Yes, one of whom
was compromised

03:36.997 --> 03:38.830
and when the dust settled,
resigned.

03:38.832 --> 03:39.964
You're blaming Brody?

03:39.966 --> 03:42.066
Stating facts.
Four NCIS agents

03:42.068 --> 03:43.935
responsible for
most of the Gulf Coast.

03:43.937 --> 03:46.371
Meredith Brody was intimately
involved with a cartel spy.

03:46.373 --> 03:49.007
If it wasn't for her,
John Russo would have succeeded.

03:49.009 --> 03:51.009
And the DOJ is
not comfortable

03:51.011 --> 03:52.243
with such a slim
margin of error.

03:52.245 --> 03:53.577
In the middle of something!

03:53.579 --> 03:55.479
Multiple homicide,

03:55.481 --> 03:58.783
including a dead Navy officer
on the <i>Creole Queen.</i>

03:59.552 --> 04:01.786
Work calls,
Agent Isler.

04:07.194 --> 04:09.126
Sorry about that.

04:12.432 --> 04:14.097
You good, King?

04:14.099 --> 04:15.700
Dandy.

04:18.036 --> 04:21.137
Victims are Milton
Lewis, car salesman;

04:21.140 --> 04:23.574
Travis Cane, contractor.

04:24.509 --> 04:27.878
And Lieutenant Commander
Henry Warbeck.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.447
Cyber warfare engineer
out of Belle Chasse.

04:31.683 --> 04:34.318
All shot point-blank,
close range.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.518
Witnesses?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.888
No. The <i>Creole Queen</i> was
docked for renovations.

04:37.890 --> 04:39.957
Travis here,
he oversaw the work.

04:39.959 --> 04:43.460
According to NOPD, Cane's known
for his floating poker game.

04:43.462 --> 04:45.562
And judging from the
chips on the table and the empty

04:45.564 --> 04:48.798
strong box, I'd say there
was a lot of cash here.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.299
Burglary gone wrong?

04:50.301 --> 04:52.435
No, it's more like an execution.

04:52.437 --> 04:55.071
All the victims were shot
here at the table,

04:55.073 --> 04:57.340
and there's no sign
of them putting up a struggle.

04:57.342 --> 05:00.376
Well, these victims might
not have struggled...

05:00.378 --> 05:02.245
someone else did.

05:02.247 --> 05:04.146
Overturned
blackjack table.

05:05.149 --> 05:06.782
Bullet holes in the ceiling.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.817
That blood?

05:12.757 --> 05:14.390
And this...

05:14.392 --> 05:15.891
Belonged to the killer?

05:15.893 --> 05:17.359
Belongs to Elvis Bertrand.

05:17.361 --> 05:19.495
That name mean
something to you?

05:19.497 --> 05:21.764
Oh, yeah.

05:21.766 --> 05:25.534
Elvis was a Navy
intelligence analyst.

05:25.536 --> 05:28.871
He consulted on an espionage
case a few years back.

05:28.873 --> 05:31.606
Put himself on the line
to take out a spy ring.

05:31.608 --> 05:32.908
We became close.

05:32.910 --> 05:35.043
He's been a handful
for King ever since.

05:35.045 --> 05:36.677
So, does he live up
to the name?

05:36.679 --> 05:39.948
Hard drinking,
gambling, living, yeah.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.416
Not exactly cut
from Navy cloth.

05:41.418 --> 05:44.119
No, but a savant when it
came to cyber warfare.

05:44.121 --> 05:45.353
One of the best.

05:45.355 --> 05:46.821
I lost count of how many times

05:46.823 --> 05:49.223
Pride's had to bail him out
of a rough spot.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.558
Like triple murder rough?

05:50.560 --> 05:52.293
Elvis is a hacker,
troublemaker,

05:52.295 --> 05:54.762
half a con man, but
no kind of killer.

05:54.764 --> 05:55.926
Well, it doesn't
look good, King.

05:55.950 --> 05:56.832
Hey.

05:56.833 --> 06:00.000
We'll canvass witnesses,
check surveillance.

06:00.002 --> 06:01.536
We'll find Elvis.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.952
Judging from expression,

06:17.954 --> 06:20.253
you have not had
a productive afternoon.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.122
Went to Elvis's apartment,
favorite bar,

06:23.124 --> 06:25.959
second favorite bar,
every place I've ever found him

06:25.961 --> 06:27.828
in the past-- no luck.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.530
Well, he can't be that hard to
find, not in this day and age.

06:30.532 --> 06:32.332
GPS, digital trail.

06:32.334 --> 06:34.701
Elvis is too smart
and too paranoid

06:34.703 --> 06:36.635
to leave any kind of trace.

06:36.637 --> 06:39.138
If he wants off the grid,
he's gone.

06:39.140 --> 06:42.275
Or he could be
another victim.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.011
I'm trying not to let
that idea distract me.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.545
You're already
distracted, Dwayne.

06:46.547 --> 06:48.014
The FBI review.

06:48.016 --> 06:52.352
Yeah. Not so much a review
as a coordinated attack.

06:52.354 --> 06:54.052
Well, sure you handled
it diplomatically.

06:54.054 --> 06:55.488
I did.

06:55.490 --> 06:59.191
Until Isler started
pointing fingers at Merri.

06:59.193 --> 07:01.259
Used her as a scapegoat, then?

07:01.261 --> 07:02.628
How'd you handle that?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.463
Not diplomatically,
that's for sure.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.231
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

07:06.233 --> 07:07.733
Uh, I waited
as long as I could.

07:07.735 --> 07:09.167
I know you're having
a private conversation.

07:09.169 --> 07:10.798
I just... I got to get
the victim's personal effects.

07:10.799 --> 07:11.609
It's okay, Sebastian.

07:11.633 --> 07:13.072
Okay, great, 'cause, look,
I'm dying to know:

07:13.073 --> 07:16.174
is <i>the</i> Elvis Bertrand
involved in this case?

07:16.176 --> 07:18.010
You know him?
Well, I-I wish.

07:18.012 --> 07:20.112
He's like the... he's like
the hacker of the people.

07:20.114 --> 07:22.747
He breaks into
corporate computer networks,

07:22.749 --> 07:24.116
then he releases
all their dirty laundry.

07:24.118 --> 07:25.384
He's a personal hero.

07:25.386 --> 07:27.685
Made a lot of enemies
pulling those stunts, Sebastian,

07:27.687 --> 07:31.188
including the
Justice Department.

07:31.190 --> 07:34.425
Got himself banned
from using the Internet

07:34.427 --> 07:37.595
instead of jail time...
a ban he ignored.

07:40.734 --> 07:43.100
That's coming
from the evidence.

07:45.738 --> 07:47.038
Commander Warbeck's phone.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.305
Hey, give me a glove.

07:52.111 --> 07:54.311
Elvis?

07:54.313 --> 07:56.213
That's what I love
about you, Dwayne; you answer

07:56.215 --> 07:58.482
a dead man's phone, and somehow
you know it's me calling.

07:58.484 --> 07:59.850
Tell him I'm a fan.

08:02.621 --> 08:04.254
What the hell is going on?

08:04.256 --> 08:06.590
Well, I'd love to sit and chat
over a bowl of gumbo,

08:06.592 --> 08:07.925
but I got about 30 seconds

08:07.927 --> 08:09.392
before they can track
the phone I'm on.

08:09.394 --> 08:10.594
Who's they, Elvis?

08:10.596 --> 08:11.862
Uh, the government,

08:11.864 --> 08:14.965
private sector, “the Man,”
you, for all I know.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.832
Now we got 20 seconds.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.768

survive a massacre.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.582
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

10:16.584 --> 10:18.851
In cuffs or a gurney,
doesn't matter.

10:18.853 --> 10:20.386
Well, matters to me.

10:20.388 --> 10:21.821
Gun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:21.823 --> 10:23.222
Out of the way.
Calm down.

10:23.224 --> 10:24.190
Out of the way!

10:24.192 --> 10:25.758
Everybody calm down.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.793
Out of the way,
Special Agent Pride!

10:27.795 --> 10:29.795
Sorry, Dwayne.
You can't trust nobody.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.835
Elvis! Elvis!

10:40.074 --> 10:41.240
Elvis?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.176
Elvis!

10:46.279 --> 10:47.913
Dude, he's gone.

10:47.915 --> 10:51.583
I guess Elvis has
left the building.

11:05.576 --> 11:07.709
Take a walk.

11:07.711 --> 11:09.044
I'll call you back.

11:09.046 --> 11:11.247
Your drinking buddy
somehow managed to elude

11:11.249 --> 11:12.714
a dozen federal agents.

11:12.716 --> 11:13.983
'Cause you
scared him off.

11:13.985 --> 11:15.450
Was I supposed to say
“pretty please”

11:15.452 --> 11:16.685
when I arrested him
for murder?

11:16.687 --> 11:18.020
Is that the NOLA way?

11:18.022 --> 11:20.256
Elvis is many things;
murderer is not one.

11:20.258 --> 11:22.257
He's a felon convicted
of a dozen federal crimes,

11:22.259 --> 11:23.825
including hacking.

11:23.827 --> 11:26.027
Elvis has nothing to do
with my team's review.

11:26.029 --> 11:27.996
Why the hell are
you even here?

11:27.998 --> 11:29.331
Smaller town
than I remember.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.899
People run into each other.

11:30.901 --> 11:33.735
Especially when they're
investigating the same case.

11:33.737 --> 11:35.003
Didn't realize we were.

11:35.005 --> 11:36.938
Oh, so you <i>don't</i>
know everything.

11:36.940 --> 11:38.940
You want another surprise?

11:42.245 --> 11:44.045
Recognize him?

11:45.182 --> 11:46.480
Should I?

11:46.482 --> 11:49.017
Figured you knew
everyone in this town.

11:49.019 --> 11:51.485
Dead man in Elvis's trunk.

11:51.487 --> 11:53.587
Tell me again
he's not a murderer.

11:53.589 --> 11:57.692
Commander Warbeck was
a Navy computer engineer.

11:57.694 --> 12:00.494
Elvis is former
Navy Intelligence.

12:00.496 --> 12:03.431
That's NCIS's stake here.
Not seeing yours.

12:03.433 --> 12:06.334
Warbeck worked a security
project for DoD and Justice.

12:06.336 --> 12:07.901
First time hearing about it.

12:07.903 --> 12:10.838
What do you know about
underwater fiber-optic cables?

12:10.840 --> 12:12.272
I know squat, too.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.842
Except they carry all
kinds of sensitive data.

12:14.844 --> 12:17.311
Warbeck helped
secure the data,

12:17.313 --> 12:19.046
Natal Cartel wanted
to steal it.

12:19.048 --> 12:19.747
You're kidding me.

12:19.771 --> 12:21.249
IDI Investment Bank
in Brazil

12:21.250 --> 12:24.417
handles hundreds of millions
of Ciudad Natal's money.

12:24.419 --> 12:27.087
We've been monitoring the
transactions on the cables.

12:27.089 --> 12:28.955
Turns out,
we're not the only ones.

12:28.957 --> 12:33.025
You think the Natal Cartel
is hacking these cables?

12:33.027 --> 12:34.461
You're under
review regarding

12:34.463 --> 12:35.995
a cartel double agent.

12:35.997 --> 12:38.498
You need to step off
and let the cavalry handle it.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.666
I got a dead Navy officer.

12:39.668 --> 12:41.668
Your buddy's
the prime suspect.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.737
Again, you're under review.

12:43.739 --> 12:46.873
Yeah. Not that easy.

12:48.009 --> 12:53.279
I'm gonna go find Elvis
before you or your “cavalry”

12:53.281 --> 12:55.547
put a bullet in him
by mistake.

12:57.252 --> 12:59.118
Fair enough.

13:10.097 --> 13:11.697
Miss Loretta.

13:11.699 --> 13:13.766
Hoping to get autopsy results
on our latest victims.

13:13.768 --> 13:15.200
You're not alone.

13:15.202 --> 13:16.835
Isler and the FBI

13:16.837 --> 13:18.503
came a few minutes ago
with a warrant,

13:18.505 --> 13:19.637
and they're taking the victims

13:19.639 --> 13:21.639
and my results back
to their crime lab.

13:21.641 --> 13:23.275
Even the John Doe
from Elvis's car?

13:23.277 --> 13:25.310
I barely had time
to photograph the body

13:25.312 --> 13:27.478
before they told me
to cease and desist.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.948
I hate leaving something undone.

13:34.554 --> 13:36.020
Psst.

13:36.022 --> 13:37.655
Come over here!

13:38.525 --> 13:40.357
I have something
for you.

13:40.359 --> 13:41.793
But I don't want them to know,

13:41.795 --> 13:43.461
so let's be
inconspicuous, okay?

13:43.463 --> 13:44.929
Everyone just act normal.

13:44.931 --> 13:47.598
Sebastian, you couldn't look
more conspicuous

13:47.600 --> 13:49.233
than you do right now.

13:50.236 --> 13:51.768
What you got, my brother?

13:51.770 --> 13:53.904
I found it in Commander
Warbeck's personal effects.

13:53.906 --> 13:56.006
Looks like a key card
that you find in a...

13:56.008 --> 13:57.241
Mm...

13:57.243 --> 13:58.909
Looks like a common key card

13:58.911 --> 14:02.179
that you'd use in any office
or hotel, right? Wrong.

14:02.181 --> 14:03.513
Tried to analyze the chip.

14:03.515 --> 14:05.482
Encryption is, like,
next-level secure,

14:05.484 --> 14:06.817
only available to NSA,

14:06.819 --> 14:07.884
CIA...

14:07.886 --> 14:09.218
Really, any of the “A” acronyms.

14:09.220 --> 14:10.620
Well, that makes sense.

14:10.622 --> 14:12.989
Warbeck was working
a cyber security project

14:12.991 --> 14:14.624
on underwater fiber optics.

14:14.626 --> 14:16.893
Hey, you figure out where
that key card comes from,

14:16.895 --> 14:19.463
you can give us the lead
on why Warbeck was killed.

14:19.465 --> 14:20.730
Easier said than done,
but Patton and I

14:20.732 --> 14:22.298
got down and dirty,
and we decrypted this bad boy.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.732
Turns out,
it belongs to some company

14:23.734 --> 14:25.601
called Certel--
contracts with the government.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.603
I don't know-- Pride's
on his way there right now.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.105
No, it's my
understanding

14:29.107 --> 14:31.074
that we aren't on this case.

14:31.076 --> 14:33.509
Or are we taking the
FBI order as optional?

14:33.511 --> 14:35.878
Well, Pride sure is,
and we got his back.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.746
Oh, <i>ixnay</i> on the <i>ack-bay.</i>

14:37.748 --> 14:39.682
Special Agents
Lasalle and Percy.

14:39.684 --> 14:41.350
Got some free time
on your hands?

14:41.352 --> 14:44.453
Why not come back to the FBI,
get your interviews over with?

14:46.056 --> 14:48.657
<i>Thought FBI was handling</i>

14:48.659 --> 14:50.092
Commander Warbeck's murder,
Agent Pride.

14:50.094 --> 14:53.095
Call it a joint
investigation.

14:53.097 --> 14:54.797
My team found the
commander's key card,

14:54.799 --> 14:56.331
traced it here to Certel.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.632
You do cyber security.

14:57.634 --> 14:59.567
We secure the integrity
of underwater

14:59.569 --> 15:01.970
fiber-optic cables
across the Southern Hemisphere.

15:01.972 --> 15:03.905
And Commander Warbeck's role?

15:03.907 --> 15:06.274
Henry was DoD liaison
for Threat Assessment.

15:06.276 --> 15:07.809
That's my division.

15:15.184 --> 15:18.185
Uh, sorry, let me just
try this again.

15:18.187 --> 15:20.354
Ten-number key code.

15:20.356 --> 15:21.623
Changed on a
daily basis.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.391
Take your security
seriously, huh?

15:23.393 --> 15:24.726
It's our business.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.865
Uh...

15:31.867 --> 15:35.002
we've all been a
little on edge lately.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.175
You and Commander Warbeck
work closely together?

15:45.148 --> 15:47.714
We oversaw the division
for two years.

15:47.716 --> 15:49.049
A lot of late nights.

15:49.051 --> 15:50.984
Commander Warbeck's murder

15:50.986 --> 15:53.319
may have been related
to his work here.

15:53.321 --> 15:54.922
Then he was right.

15:56.091 --> 15:59.693
We monitor millions of terabytes
of data on these servers.

15:59.695 --> 16:01.528
Everything from
corporate correspondence

16:01.530 --> 16:03.296
to sensitive
government communication.

16:03.298 --> 16:05.432
Henry thought he found
a sniffer.

16:05.434 --> 16:06.832
A what?

16:06.834 --> 16:08.435
It's a virtual bug
on the cable.

16:08.437 --> 16:10.203
Used to steal data.

16:10.205 --> 16:11.671
He never reported a hack.

16:11.673 --> 16:13.039
Whoever placed it was good.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.674
Henry needed confirmation,

16:14.676 --> 16:17.243
so he went to the one person
he thought he could trust,

16:17.245 --> 16:18.244
Elvis Bertrand.

16:18.246 --> 16:19.946
They served together.

16:19.948 --> 16:22.247
He was the best hacker
Henry knew.

16:24.118 --> 16:25.618
It's possible

16:25.620 --> 16:27.987
whoever breached Certel

16:27.989 --> 16:30.389
realized what Commander
Warbeck was onto.

16:30.391 --> 16:31.991
Killed him for it.

16:33.561 --> 16:35.260
Do you know anything
about the hacker?

16:35.262 --> 16:37.229
Nothing.

16:37.231 --> 16:39.131
You need to talk to Elvis.

16:39.133 --> 16:42.301
He's the only other person
who can figure out this breach.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.138
Patton, please tell me
you've tracked down Elvis.

16:46.140 --> 16:48.173
Oh, your buddy Elvis
is scary good.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.741
He turns his phone on
long enough

16:49.743 --> 16:51.776
to make short calls,
and then he powers it down.

16:51.778 --> 16:52.978
So, no luck.

16:52.980 --> 16:54.245
Hey, I'm scary good, too.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.914
I had to hit the streets
and go mobile.

16:55.916 --> 16:57.983
I can't tell you
where his phone is,

16:57.985 --> 17:00.318
but I can tell you where it was.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.787
Ever since the murders, Elvis
has been making several calls

17:02.789 --> 17:04.355
from somewhere in City Park.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.992
Elvis always had a soft spot
for the flying horses.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.892
Have Sonja and Lasalle
meet me there.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.529
Oh, I thought you knew.
Lasalle and Sonja's tied up.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.265
The FBI is interviewing them
as we speak.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.375
Guess I know what
a high colonic feels like now.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.809
They ask you about Merri?

17:25.810 --> 17:27.944
Yeah, and her
relationship with Russo.

17:27.946 --> 17:29.780
How long it was, how intense.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.382
Did I trust her?
Yeah, I trust her.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.317
Yeah, more than
these “feeb” jokers.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.286
They asked me
about King, too.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.656
Did he make it a habit
of breaking protocol?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.891
Look, Isler's gonna make
stopping a terrorist attack

17:41.893 --> 17:45.828
into an actionable offense,
hanging us all out to dry.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.664
I want to know.

17:47.666 --> 17:48.865
What are you doing?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.134
There's something
going on over there.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.502
I couldn't catch
a lot of it.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.305
A lot of whispered
conversation, but...

17:55.307 --> 17:58.007
I think they got
a line on Elvis.

17:59.477 --> 18:00.843
Well, let's find out.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.779
You want to follow her?

18:02.781 --> 18:05.214
You know how much trouble
that's gonna get us in?

18:05.216 --> 18:07.249
We're already in trouble.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.988
No sign of Elvis anywhere.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.790
All I can tell you is
your boy was clocking

18:13.792 --> 18:15.591
some serious hours
around here yesterday.

18:15.593 --> 18:17.693
Far as I know,
he can be in Cuba by now.

18:17.695 --> 18:19.395
Patton?

18:19.397 --> 18:21.129
Patton, you there?

18:21.131 --> 18:24.800
No, no, it's me,
Fidel Castro, hacking in.

18:24.802 --> 18:27.002
I disconnected Patton.

18:27.004 --> 18:29.238
Although I am impressed that you
boys actually tracked me down.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.506
We got a lot to talk about.

18:31.508 --> 18:34.342
Breach of the Certel
fiber-optic cables.

18:34.344 --> 18:36.411
Dead body in your trunk.

18:36.413 --> 18:37.913
Yeah, well, he had it coming.

18:37.915 --> 18:39.380
He killed Henry and the others.

18:39.382 --> 18:41.416
You know, they might have
been bad poker players,

18:41.418 --> 18:43.284
but they did not deserve
to die.

18:43.286 --> 18:45.954
No more jokes.
This is serious.

18:45.956 --> 18:47.888
Well, he tried to kill me, too.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.458
And, dumb luck,
I survived and he didn't.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.228
And trust me, brother,
I'm not laughing.

18:53.230 --> 18:55.830
Look, I need the truth, Elvis.

18:55.832 --> 18:58.199
Did Commander Warbeck
come to you for help

18:58.201 --> 19:00.801
on the Certel breach
or because you were involved?

19:00.803 --> 19:02.737
You think I'd do
something like that?

19:02.739 --> 19:04.338
You have before, Elvis.

19:04.340 --> 19:08.209
Okay, good point,
good point, I have, but...

19:08.211 --> 19:10.410
I am too smart
to get caught twice.

19:12.048 --> 19:15.049
Carousel? Really?

19:15.051 --> 19:17.051
You got to come in.

19:17.053 --> 19:18.786
So the FBI could scapegoat me,

19:18.788 --> 19:21.755
like they're scapegoating you
and your team.

19:21.757 --> 19:24.258
Wait a minute, Elvis.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.092
Did you hack the FBI?

19:26.094 --> 19:27.827
Hey, turnabout's fair play, man.

19:27.829 --> 19:30.397
And by the way, you're in
their crosshairs, too, brother.

19:30.399 --> 19:32.899
FBI thinks that you're a killer.

19:32.901 --> 19:36.102
They will not hesitate
in taking you out.

19:36.104 --> 19:39.005
They're gonna have to,
because I'm not going to prison.

19:39.007 --> 19:40.173
Elvis...

19:48.049 --> 19:49.249
Elvis.

19:49.251 --> 19:51.050
See you around, Dwayne.

19:51.052 --> 19:52.085
He's not...

19:55.256 --> 19:56.455
Yeah, Christopher?

19:56.457 --> 19:58.056
Just got out of the FBI.

19:58.058 --> 20:00.058
Pretty sure Tammy's got
a lead on Elvis,

20:00.060 --> 20:01.394
so we're kind of
following her.

20:01.396 --> 20:03.962
But we will stand down
if you want us to.

20:03.964 --> 20:05.130
No.

20:05.132 --> 20:07.600
No, keep on it,
whatever happens.

20:09.337 --> 20:12.237
We got to get to Elvis
before the FBI does.

20:12.239 --> 20:15.107
He won't let them
take him alive.

20:28.542 --> 20:31.076
You need to be cautious,
Christopher.

20:31.078 --> 20:32.777
If Tammy realizes
what you're doing,

20:32.779 --> 20:34.546
all hell will break loose.

20:34.548 --> 20:35.780
Keep me updated.

20:35.782 --> 20:37.749
Sounds like you're
up to no good.

20:37.751 --> 20:40.085
Lasalle and Sonja are
tailing the FBI agent

20:40.087 --> 20:43.421
investigating us,
hoping that she will lead them

20:43.423 --> 20:46.557
to my fugitive friend.

20:46.559 --> 20:48.693
No good at all.

20:48.695 --> 20:50.361
That's nothing.

20:50.363 --> 20:52.930
Has me trying to confirm
that Certel's fiber optics

20:52.932 --> 20:54.332
were being hacked.

20:54.334 --> 20:55.699
I'm breaking
a dozen federal laws

20:55.701 --> 20:57.101
hacking them myself.

20:57.103 --> 20:59.170
FBI doesn't care about
Commander Warbeck's murder.

20:59.172 --> 21:00.438
Only want to prove
that there's

21:00.440 --> 21:03.341
some sort of
a cartel conspiracy.

21:03.343 --> 21:05.576
Why not let them flounder?
I can't.

21:05.578 --> 21:08.379
Odds are, Elvis will
get himself killed.

21:08.381 --> 21:11.381
By the actual suspects
or the FBI.

21:11.383 --> 21:13.216
You got something,
Loretta?

21:13.218 --> 21:17.287
Oh. The FBI took
our evidence, uh,

21:17.289 --> 21:20.724
but I may have
neglected to give them

21:20.726 --> 21:23.961
the photos of the body
found in Elvis's trunk.

21:23.963 --> 21:25.428
The man he said
was responsible

21:25.430 --> 21:27.164
for the three murders
in the poker room?

21:27.166 --> 21:29.199
Brimming with respect for you
right now, Loretta.

21:29.201 --> 21:30.367
Didn't have time

21:30.369 --> 21:32.735
for a proper autopsy,

21:32.737 --> 21:35.605
let alone fingerprints or DNA.

21:35.607 --> 21:37.307
But I have these.

21:37.309 --> 21:39.876
Crude.
Improvised inks.

21:39.878 --> 21:41.678
Yeah, something
you'd get in prison.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.414
These tattoos highlight
the gangs he ran with.

21:45.416 --> 21:47.150
It's like a resume.

21:47.152 --> 21:49.819
Sebastian did some legwork,
came up with this I.D.

21:50.655 --> 21:52.655
Max Connor.

21:52.657 --> 21:54.657
Serving ten years.

21:54.659 --> 21:56.325
Robbery, aggravated assault.

21:56.327 --> 21:58.360
Common crook.

21:58.362 --> 22:00.762
Not the type to get involved
in high-level hacking,

22:00.764 --> 22:02.831
let alone a cartel soldier.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.400
Blows up the FBI theory.

22:04.402 --> 22:06.735
He had to have
had an accomplice.

22:06.737 --> 22:08.637
Someone with computer skills.

22:08.639 --> 22:11.407
Or someone with access
to Certel.

22:11.409 --> 22:14.776
Uh, well, I-I did
a little digging.

22:14.778 --> 22:17.679
And turns out, Max Connor
has a brother James.

22:17.681 --> 22:21.482
He's a technician
contracted with Certel to run

22:21.484 --> 22:23.785
their underwater cable.

22:23.787 --> 22:25.187
He had inside knowledge

22:25.189 --> 22:27.055
of the engineering.

22:27.057 --> 22:29.257
Regular Nancy Drew over there.

22:29.259 --> 22:32.260
I want to know
where he is right now.

22:32.262 --> 22:33.994
Way ahead of you.
I'm-a pull up the GPS

22:33.996 --> 22:35.330
on his phone, we'll find him.

22:46.476 --> 22:49.777
See? I told you, you're
getting too close to her.

22:49.779 --> 22:52.078
What do you mean?
I'm two car lengths behind.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.614
I know how to follow a suspect.

22:53.616 --> 22:56.015
Yeah, but she's not
a suspect, she's FBI.

22:56.017 --> 22:58.918
If she makes us, we lose
our only lead on Elvis.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.654
Probably our jobs.

23:00.656 --> 23:02.122
Yeah, so be quiet.

23:02.124 --> 23:04.157
Oh, you be quiet.
I got this.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.369
Dad-gummit.

23:16.371 --> 23:17.904
Ugh, I told you.

23:17.906 --> 23:20.539
She made us.
She did not.

23:20.541 --> 23:23.743
All right, well, I guess we'll
just wait here and find out.

23:29.350 --> 23:30.449
Hey.

23:32.153 --> 23:33.486
All right, enough.

23:33.488 --> 23:35.020
We got to talk.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.789
No denials,
no deflections.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.024
You've been acting weird
toward me ever since we hugged

23:39.026 --> 23:40.225
after the Russo case.

23:40.227 --> 23:42.094
And... we had a moment.

23:42.096 --> 23:45.297
Okay, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.400
'Cause we agreed we're not
talking about this.

23:48.402 --> 23:50.202
'Cause we're cool.

23:50.204 --> 23:51.804
'Cause that's bygones.

23:51.806 --> 23:52.871
We're anything but cool.

23:52.873 --> 23:55.340
We're supposed
to be a team

23:55.342 --> 23:58.209
and trust each other; I can't
even reach for my water

23:58.211 --> 24:00.111
without you jumping
out of your skin.

24:00.113 --> 24:01.546
I didn't jump.

24:01.548 --> 24:04.549
I was just... startled.

24:04.551 --> 24:07.885
We're a man down and we're
under attack, all right?

24:07.887 --> 24:11.889
We need to close ranks so that
we have each other's back.

24:11.891 --> 24:15.159
I've got your back, Lasalle.

24:15.161 --> 24:17.094
And I got yours.

24:20.233 --> 24:23.634
And now...

24:23.636 --> 24:24.936
What the hell?

24:29.709 --> 24:31.742
Ooh... boy.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.647
Now we are screwed.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.048
All right.

24:39.552 --> 24:41.785
<i>Yeah, Pride, we might have</i>

24:41.787 --> 24:44.154
a little problem with the FBI.

24:44.156 --> 24:46.156
Gregorio just made us.

24:46.158 --> 24:47.690
Damn.

24:47.692 --> 24:49.960
Okay, where is she now?

24:49.962 --> 24:51.862
Looks like she's on foot
walking down Rampart.

24:51.864 --> 24:53.730
- Be right with you.
- Okay, well,

24:53.732 --> 24:57.300
Patton found the brother of
our dead gunman, James Connor.

24:57.302 --> 24:58.501
Uh-oh.

24:58.503 --> 25:00.636
Yeah, he may have spotted me.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.673
Yeah, he did.

25:04.743 --> 25:07.343
Headed to Rampart.

25:07.345 --> 25:09.211
Tammy and the suspect
going the same way.

25:09.213 --> 25:11.180
Out of the car, now!

25:11.182 --> 25:13.516
Something's about to go down.

25:14.285 --> 25:15.385
Don't shoot me.

25:15.387 --> 25:17.119
Come on, let's go.
All right.

25:30.167 --> 25:32.935
Keep walking.
Act natural.

25:32.937 --> 25:34.370
Why'd you have me
meet you here?

25:34.372 --> 25:35.971
I need your help.

25:38.509 --> 25:40.008
Come on, come on, come on.

25:40.010 --> 25:41.976
FBI are saying bad things
about you, Elvis.

25:41.978 --> 25:43.812
That you're responsible
for what happened to Henry.

25:43.814 --> 25:46.515
You know me, Anne.
I would never hurt Henry.

25:46.517 --> 25:48.850
I was trying to help him.
So why'd you run?

25:48.852 --> 25:50.519
'Cause I want to figure
out who killed him.

25:50.521 --> 25:51.753
But I need your help.

25:51.755 --> 25:53.687
You have to give me
access to Certel servers.

25:53.689 --> 25:55.089
No, I can't give you that.

25:55.091 --> 25:56.557
That's the only way I
can find the hacker.

25:56.559 --> 26:00.028
Anne, you have to trust me
as much as I trust you, okay?

26:00.030 --> 26:03.398
Elvis, I'm so sorry.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.166
She didn't give
me a choice here.

26:05.168 --> 26:06.434
“She”?

26:06.436 --> 26:08.202
Hands where I can see them,
Elvis.

26:08.204 --> 26:10.905
Anne...

26:25.788 --> 26:27.154
I got a dozen agents
a block away.

26:27.156 --> 26:28.956
I told Anne here
I'd keep it civilized.

26:28.958 --> 26:30.824
Don't make me a liar!
They had a trace

26:30.826 --> 26:33.393
on my phone, they knew
I was coming to see you.

26:33.395 --> 26:35.495
Don't be too torn apart.

26:35.497 --> 26:37.537
It's probably the weapon
that killed your boyfriend.

26:42.871 --> 26:44.203
Everyone down!

26:54.683 --> 26:55.457
We got a male suspect
on a motorcycle!

26:55.481 --> 26:56.684
We got a suspect,
James Connor,

26:56.685 --> 26:57.784
headed to Esplanade!
On a motorcycle!

26:57.786 --> 26:59.651
Black leather jacket,
black motorcycle.

26:59.653 --> 27:01.120
Everybody all right?
Elvis, you okay?

27:01.122 --> 27:02.521
I'm good. I'll call you later.

27:02.523 --> 27:04.623
Elvis, where the hell
are you going?!

27:04.625 --> 27:05.891
You all right?

27:05.893 --> 27:08.160
You're a jackass!
You freakin' follow me, too?!

27:08.162 --> 27:10.296
And saved your life.

27:11.366 --> 27:13.732
You're welcome.
Yeah.

27:27.317 --> 27:29.151
You had people
follow an FBI agent

27:29.153 --> 27:31.086
that's actively
investigating you?

27:31.088 --> 27:32.620
Your M.E. smuggled
autopsy photos.

27:32.622 --> 27:34.656
And I'm not sure
what your computer expert did,

27:34.658 --> 27:36.091
but I know that it's not good.

27:36.093 --> 27:37.959
Told you we weren't
gonna stand down.

27:37.961 --> 27:39.361
Well, there's a line between
not standing down

27:39.363 --> 27:41.029
and obstruction;
and it's not a fine one.

27:41.031 --> 27:43.798
Wasn't for my team,
we would not I.D. James Connor

27:43.800 --> 27:45.467
in the Certel breach,
let alone stop him

27:45.469 --> 27:47.669
from shooting
Agent Gregorio here.

27:47.671 --> 27:50.337
Not the point at all.
It's a little bit the point.

27:50.339 --> 27:51.539
King?

27:51.541 --> 27:52.574
What do you got?

27:52.576 --> 27:54.341
We searched the
entire area.

27:54.343 --> 27:56.711
Found James Connor's
bike a few blocks away.

27:56.713 --> 27:59.213
Yeah, no sign of him, but
there was blood, so he's hurt.

27:59.215 --> 28:00.347
Hook up with Patton.

28:00.349 --> 28:02.083
Get Connor's last known address.
Find him.

28:02.085 --> 28:03.917
Excuse me.
NCIS is still under review.

28:03.919 --> 28:06.087
No one's going anywhere.
Come on, Isler.

28:06.089 --> 28:08.522
James Connor is our only link
to whoever hacked Certel.

28:08.524 --> 28:10.524
He's not our only link;
we have Elvis.

28:10.526 --> 28:12.393
Elvis almost got shot
looking for the hacker.

28:12.395 --> 28:14.828
Go ahead,
chase your tail

28:14.830 --> 28:18.332
trying implicate him
as a Ciudad Natal stooge.

28:18.334 --> 28:19.866
My team will
keep working. Go.

28:19.868 --> 28:21.267
Your team stands down.

28:21.269 --> 28:23.269
Sir, Agent Pride
is right.

28:24.339 --> 28:25.538
Better if we pool
our resources,

28:25.540 --> 28:28.609
work together to bring
the suspects in.

28:29.979 --> 28:31.912
Plenty of time to escort us
to the gallows,

28:31.914 --> 28:33.780
once we've solved the case.

28:38.420 --> 28:42.054
Special Agent Gregorio,
go with Butch and Sundance.

28:42.056 --> 28:44.023
Find Connor.

28:44.025 --> 28:46.292
You're Butch, I'm Sundance.

28:47.229 --> 28:49.962
That makes us even.

29:00.875 --> 29:02.407
Percy and
I's got the front.

29:02.409 --> 29:04.209
You take the back.
Why do I take the back?

29:04.211 --> 29:06.612
Someone's got to.
Sure, someone, just not me.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.380
Are you kidding me?
Am I smiling?

29:08.382 --> 29:10.048
Sometimes it's hard to tell.

29:10.050 --> 29:12.117
Geez Louise,
I'll take the back.

29:12.119 --> 29:13.652
Just don't shoot me, all right?

29:21.562 --> 29:23.061
On three.

29:23.063 --> 29:25.429
One, two, three.

29:29.870 --> 29:30.701
Clear.

29:30.703 --> 29:32.269
It's clear.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.504
Clear.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.743
Connor's gone.
He was here recently.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.945
Cleaned up his wounds,
got out of town?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.914
Well, he didn't get far
without his “go bag”"

29:43.916 --> 29:46.383
Cash, passport, clothes.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.718
Money's not gonna be a problem.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.321
Account balances at
several Cayman banks.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.490
Millions of dollars

29:53.492 --> 29:54.757
transferred in
the last two weeks.

29:54.759 --> 29:57.093
That's a lot of dough
for a glorified cable guy.

29:57.095 --> 29:58.328
Hey, what if we're wrong?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.129
What if the breach
had nothing to do

30:00.131 --> 30:02.232
with the espionage
or the cartels?

30:02.234 --> 30:04.133
What if it's just
a simple bank robbery?

30:04.135 --> 30:07.403
Hackers and the Connors steal
the money from the IDI bank

30:07.405 --> 30:09.338
thinking there's
no way to trace it.

30:09.340 --> 30:12.341
But then things go sideways
when Warbeck catches on.

30:12.343 --> 30:14.376
Yeah, but where's Connor now?

30:16.347 --> 30:19.315
<i>Elvis, you know</i>
<i>I believe you're innocent.</i>

30:19.317 --> 30:21.350
But the evidence looks bad.

30:21.352 --> 30:24.453
Got to explain yourself
or I can't help.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.023
Okay.

30:30.928 --> 30:33.128
Can I get a bowl of gumbo?

30:34.398 --> 30:35.764
Listen, I didn't
hack anybody.

30:35.766 --> 30:38.934
Warbeck found a sniffer
down at Certel.

30:38.936 --> 30:41.402
Someone had transferred data
off the server.

30:41.404 --> 30:45.006
What kind of data?
Elvis, what kind of data?

30:45.008 --> 30:47.209
I don't know, but it went
to an investment bank.

30:47.211 --> 30:49.410
IDI Bank.

30:49.412 --> 30:50.846
Under Justice Department
investigation

30:50.848 --> 30:52.948
for working with
the Ciudad Natal Cartel.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.549
And about a thousand
other clients.

30:54.551 --> 30:55.750
The point is

30:55.752 --> 30:57.485
Warbeck couldn't trace it,
so I helped him out.

30:57.487 --> 31:00.154
He came to a convicted felon.
He came to a friend.

31:00.156 --> 31:01.522
He wondered
if it was an attack

31:01.524 --> 31:03.124
from the outside
or an inside job.

31:03.126 --> 31:04.225
And how exactly
could he do that?

31:04.227 --> 31:05.627
You know,
I would explain it to you,

31:05.629 --> 31:07.328
but you still would not
understand it.

31:07.330 --> 31:09.597
Try and, uh...

31:09.599 --> 31:13.000
Try and dumb it
down for me.

31:13.002 --> 31:15.702
Warbeck brought me
the corrupted data.

31:15.704 --> 31:18.773
I went through the logs looking
for the hacker's signature,

31:18.775 --> 31:21.809
because they almost always
leave a digital trace.

31:21.811 --> 31:24.544
Skip to the part where three men
end up dead at the poker game.

31:24.546 --> 31:26.380
We played poker together
all the time.

31:26.382 --> 31:28.415
I was there to tell them
what I'd found.

31:28.417 --> 31:30.484
Unfortunately,
someone was tracking us.

31:30.486 --> 31:32.653
Max Connor, who was found
dead in your car trunk.

31:32.655 --> 31:35.021
Right, he killed those guys,
and he tried to kill me, too.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.190
And I got lucky.
Or he was your partner,

31:37.192 --> 31:39.993
along with his brother James,
who worked at Certel.

31:39.995 --> 31:42.162
You hacked the servers.
When Warbeck got wind of it,

31:42.164 --> 31:44.164
you had him killed.
Don't be an idiot!

31:44.166 --> 31:45.331
I had nothing to do with it.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.233
I was helping out
my buddy, okay?

31:47.235 --> 31:49.035
And I'll bring you your hacker,
all right?

31:49.037 --> 31:50.804
Whether he's on the inside
or the outside.

31:50.806 --> 31:53.673
But you got to let me
on Certel's servers.

31:53.675 --> 31:55.541
So you can clear
any damning evidence?

31:55.543 --> 31:57.043
Don't hold your breath, Elvis.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.644
So stupid.

31:58.646 --> 32:01.980
Dwayne, I swear to God,
I'm telling the truth.

32:01.982 --> 32:04.216
And I can back up
every word of it.

32:04.218 --> 32:06.485
Those files
that Henry gave me

32:06.487 --> 32:08.521
are hidden in my laptop.

32:08.523 --> 32:10.022
Check it out.

32:10.024 --> 32:11.657
Now, I know I'm a screwup,

32:11.659 --> 32:13.659
but you know damn well

32:13.661 --> 32:17.595
I want to find the killer
of Henry just as much as you do.

32:21.168 --> 32:22.500
<i>So?</i>

32:22.502 --> 32:24.837
What do the
files tell you?

32:24.839 --> 32:27.339
Hundreds of terabytes
of the Certel breach.

32:27.341 --> 32:28.874
IDI Bank mainly.

32:28.876 --> 32:31.009
Just like Elvis said.
All this proves

32:31.011 --> 32:32.477
is that he had the stolen data.

32:32.479 --> 32:34.045
That and the murder weapon?

32:34.047 --> 32:35.847
He's on the next plane
back to D.C.

32:35.849 --> 32:37.382
You're not thinking
this through.

32:37.384 --> 32:38.583
You still trying to protect
your friend?

32:38.585 --> 32:40.051
Is this some kind of
New Orleans thing?

32:40.053 --> 32:41.686
Because I don't
understand it at all.

32:41.688 --> 32:43.722
Open your eyes.
If I believed Elvis was guilty,

32:43.724 --> 32:45.089
I'd be leading
the charge.

32:45.091 --> 32:46.991
I say he's working for
Ciudad Natal.

32:46.993 --> 32:49.360
Helping them to undermine our
investigation into their funds.

32:49.362 --> 32:51.628
Nothing to prove that except
your desire for it to be true.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.664
I'll prove it
when I get him back to D.C.

32:53.666 --> 32:55.566
You don't understand
New Orleans,

32:55.568 --> 32:58.602
but I understand D.C.,
and in D.C. you're only as good

32:58.604 --> 33:00.004
as your last accomplishment.

33:00.006 --> 33:01.138
There a point?

33:01.140 --> 33:02.439
If you're wrong here--

33:02.441 --> 33:04.876
and you are--
it's career ending.

33:04.878 --> 33:06.243
You'll come off
like a fool.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.011
You know it's true.

33:08.013 --> 33:09.346
But?

33:09.348 --> 33:10.647
Wait 12 hours.

33:10.649 --> 33:13.684
Let our people track
down James Connor.

33:13.686 --> 33:15.386
Let Elvis into Certel,

33:15.388 --> 33:16.687
check their servers,

33:16.689 --> 33:17.755
find the real hacker.

33:17.757 --> 33:18.856
And if he runs?
He won't.

33:18.858 --> 33:20.391
I'll stake my career on it.

33:20.393 --> 33:23.093
And if he can't prove
the hacker's still out there,

33:23.095 --> 33:25.862
I'll escort him to D.C.
with you.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.634
We got wires hooked
into your cell phone.

33:31.636 --> 33:32.835
You'll be able to hear us
through this earwig.

33:32.837 --> 33:34.971
Plus, I have a feed
into the building's

33:34.973 --> 33:37.007
security cameras.
We have eyes all over.

33:37.009 --> 33:38.574
I'll be watching
your every move.

33:38.576 --> 33:39.975
Well, I figure
you Feds have been

33:39.977 --> 33:40.976
doing that for years, anyways.

33:40.978 --> 33:42.278
The minute you
go off book,

33:42.280 --> 33:43.746
I pull the plug
and you're back in custody.

33:43.748 --> 33:44.980
He's not going off book.

33:47.318 --> 33:49.184
Hey, don't
go off book, okay?

33:54.025 --> 33:55.991
You got a dangerous amount
of trust in people.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.593
I don't know how to do it
any other way.

33:58.595 --> 34:00.729
Yeah, this goes wrong,
we're both screwed.

34:00.731 --> 34:02.611
You'll have much bigger problems
than my review.

34:04.368 --> 34:06.168
<i>Don't worry about anything.</i>

34:06.170 --> 34:07.702
Just get me into
the servers.

34:07.704 --> 34:09.538
I'll do the rest.
Anne.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.206
Didn't expect to see
you here after hours.

34:11.208 --> 34:12.206
Who's this?

34:12.208 --> 34:13.341
Maintenance.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.576
Problem with the
air conditioning.

34:14.578 --> 34:16.610
Got to keep
the hard drives cool.

34:25.088 --> 34:27.556
And they're in. So far, so good.

34:36.899 --> 34:37.998
What just happened?

34:38.001 --> 34:39.167
That's not on our end.

34:39.168 --> 34:40.568
Someone cut the feed.

34:57.139 --> 34:58.472
Got something
off Connor's computer.

34:58.474 --> 34:59.973
Talk to me.

34:59.975 --> 35:01.608
James Connor's on his way,
if he's not here already.

35:01.610 --> 35:04.144
Someone gave him the security
access code to Certel.

35:04.146 --> 35:05.346
Where's Elvis?

35:05.348 --> 35:06.747
He's up in
Certel's offices.

35:06.749 --> 35:08.415
Security feed got cut,
probably by Elvis.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.116
He played us, Pride.
He's working with Connor.

35:10.118 --> 35:12.485
We don't know
anything right now.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.620
You find Connor.
I'll secure Elvis.

35:14.622 --> 35:16.456
You got it.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.158
I'm calling for backup.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.126
Good idea.

35:20.128 --> 35:21.294
I could get
in serious trouble.

35:21.296 --> 35:22.562
The FBI sent me here.

35:22.564 --> 35:23.964
You'll be okay.

35:23.966 --> 35:26.833
Remember, we're doing this
for Henry.

35:31.105 --> 35:32.705
James Connor!

35:32.707 --> 35:34.674
Stop where you are!

35:36.310 --> 35:37.410
Connor!

35:47.355 --> 35:48.988
Clear.

35:48.990 --> 35:50.756
Nice shooting, ladies.

35:52.293 --> 35:53.458
“You're taking too long.

35:53.460 --> 35:54.894
I'm handling this myself.”

35:54.896 --> 35:55.961
What does that mean?

35:55.963 --> 35:57.162
It means whoever's working

35:57.164 --> 35:59.231
for Connor is already in Certel.

35:59.233 --> 36:00.732
Any luck?

36:00.734 --> 36:02.100
Whoever breached the servers

36:02.102 --> 36:04.503
did a good job
of covering their tracks.

36:04.505 --> 36:06.003
So, you can't I.D.
the hacker?

36:06.005 --> 36:08.105
No, no, no, I can,

36:08.107 --> 36:10.574
but the hacker scrubbed
the servers from the inside,

36:10.576 --> 36:12.309
so it was a Certel employee

36:12.311 --> 36:15.646
with complete
security clearance...

36:15.648 --> 36:18.282
from this computer.

36:23.289 --> 36:25.455
You're very good, Anne.

36:27.592 --> 36:29.326
Clearly not good enough.

36:29.328 --> 36:30.994
But you're gonna help.

36:30.996 --> 36:32.896
Erase any signs
that I hacked the server.

36:32.898 --> 36:34.697
You killed my friend.

36:34.699 --> 36:36.466
I don't make them too easy.

36:36.468 --> 36:38.168
I'm not gonna help you
get away with it.

36:38.170 --> 36:39.969
You don't have a choice.
Hell if I don't.

36:43.241 --> 36:45.207
Elvis!

36:45.209 --> 36:46.242
Don't try to
stop me, Dwayne.

36:46.244 --> 36:47.310
You need to think this through.

36:47.312 --> 36:49.412
She killed Henry and
the other two men.

36:49.414 --> 36:50.880
Tried to cover her ass.

36:50.882 --> 36:52.582
Thinks she's some kind
of spy or something.

36:52.584 --> 36:54.250
She's not a spy.

36:54.252 --> 36:56.919
She just hacked into
the IDI Bank to steal money.

36:56.921 --> 36:58.587
I didn't do any of it.

36:59.457 --> 37:01.523
Elvis...

37:01.525 --> 37:03.225
you know me.

37:03.227 --> 37:04.760
I loved Henry.

37:04.762 --> 37:06.562
Stop with your tears
and your lies,

37:06.564 --> 37:08.331
'cause nobody
believes them, okay?!

37:08.333 --> 37:11.300
Oh, I swear.
I didn't want him to get hurt.

37:11.302 --> 37:12.968
It was their idea to kill him.

37:12.970 --> 37:14.536
Hard to sell to a jury.

37:14.538 --> 37:16.438
I am the jury.

37:17.407 --> 37:18.474
Elvis,

37:18.476 --> 37:20.676
you need to think this through.

37:20.678 --> 37:24.245
Pull that trigger,
you're throwing your life away.

37:24.247 --> 37:26.081
Henry deserves justice!

37:26.083 --> 37:28.816
This isn't justice.
It's revenge.

37:28.818 --> 37:31.086
Those are just words.

37:31.088 --> 37:33.288
More than that.

37:33.290 --> 37:35.123
Make her face
what she's done.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.557
Pay the price.

37:36.559 --> 37:38.360
Cold cell for
the rest of her days.

37:38.362 --> 37:39.594
Better her than you.

37:39.596 --> 37:41.929
Nobody's gonna spend any time
in a cold cell!

37:41.931 --> 37:43.798
There's a lot of bullets
in this gun!

37:43.800 --> 37:44.632
No.

37:44.634 --> 37:46.667
Henry was my only friend!

37:48.137 --> 37:50.505
Only friend?

37:59.348 --> 38:01.915
You're right.

38:01.917 --> 38:04.551
She's not worth it.

38:21.703 --> 38:24.004
Assistant Director Isler.

38:24.006 --> 38:25.038
Well, well.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.039
Let me see.

38:26.041 --> 38:28.441
Anne Foreman's
in federal custody.

38:28.443 --> 38:30.476
Elvis is gonna be cleared
of all wrongdoing.

38:30.478 --> 38:34.947
I'm guessing you're here
on some other matter.

38:34.949 --> 38:36.416
Mm...

38:36.418 --> 38:39.552
I... can't fathom
your methods down here,

38:39.554 --> 38:40.819
but I'm impressed.

38:40.821 --> 38:42.655
You and your team
got the job done.

38:42.657 --> 38:44.524
Just like we did

38:44.526 --> 38:46.392
in the John Russo case.

38:46.394 --> 38:47.860
Well, I advise you
to follow protocol

38:47.862 --> 38:49.862
next time you come across
someone like John Russo,

38:49.864 --> 38:53.131
but I see no reason to penalize
anyone on your team.

38:53.133 --> 38:56.569
The FBI review of
NCIS is closed.

38:56.571 --> 38:57.937
Great.

38:57.939 --> 39:00.505
So, you're on a plane
back to D.C., too.

39:00.507 --> 39:01.707
Actually, no.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.341
There's no reason
to pursue NCIS,

39:03.343 --> 39:04.643
but there's still evidence

39:04.645 --> 39:06.979
Ciudad Natal
is active in New Orleans.

39:06.981 --> 39:08.213
You just don't
have the money

39:08.215 --> 39:09.981
and the hardware
to-to handle them.

39:09.983 --> 39:11.683
We stay until they're gone.

39:14.588 --> 39:17.155
Well, I can just, I can tell
that you're all thrilled.

39:17.157 --> 39:18.290
Let's just say

39:18.292 --> 39:20.325
we look forward to you
clearing them out fast.

39:20.327 --> 39:21.726
Pride, let's, um...

39:21.728 --> 39:23.761
let's talk privately.

39:25.732 --> 39:27.632
Sure.

39:29.069 --> 39:31.903
Butch. Sundance.

39:32.906 --> 39:35.006
What do you think
that's about?

39:35.008 --> 39:36.373
Don't know. Don't care.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.742
I'm out of here.

39:39.946 --> 39:41.212
Hey, Percy.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.014
Are we good?

39:44.016 --> 39:46.217
Yes, Lasalle,
we're good.

39:46.219 --> 39:47.951
Okay, but no more
weird stuff.

39:49.322 --> 39:51.989
No more weird stuff.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.626
♪ Yeah ♪

39:55.628 --> 39:58.729
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

39:58.731 --> 40:01.531
♪ Whoa ♪

40:01.533 --> 40:04.501

♪ One time for a cool guy ♪

40:07.673 --> 40:10.841

so I made time... ♪

40:10.843 --> 40:12.776
Those are on me, okay?
Mm-hmm.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.577
Hey.
Hey.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.614
Hey, Dwayne, I really
like your bar.

40:17.616 --> 40:21.417
You know, it's got a style that
appeals to my seedier nature.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.286
Thank you, I think.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.454
Music is great.

40:24.456 --> 40:27.457
How the hell did
you pull that off?

40:27.459 --> 40:29.259
You got to know Quincy.
How's your arm?

40:29.261 --> 40:31.593
I don't even need it.
This is my lovemaking hand.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.595
What?!

40:33.597 --> 40:34.830
Whoa!
Huh?

40:36.200 --> 40:38.000
I never thought
I'd see her again.

40:38.002 --> 40:39.001
Thank you.

40:39.003 --> 40:41.236
What's this?

40:41.238 --> 40:42.938
Get out of jail
free card?

40:42.940 --> 40:44.140
Job offer.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.608
You impressed them, Elvis.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.911
FBI's got an opening
in their cyber crime division.

40:49.913 --> 40:51.946
Could use someone like you.

40:51.948 --> 40:55.184
Means getting back on
the computer again-- legally.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.786
Wow, what an opportunity
to be back on a computer

40:57.788 --> 41:00.989
with Big Brother watching
my every move 24/7.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.424
No, thank you.

41:02.426 --> 41:04.525
You don't seem flattered.
Listen, I worked

41:04.527 --> 41:06.695
for “the Man”
my whole adult life.

41:06.697 --> 41:08.563
I am going off the grid,
brother,

41:08.565 --> 41:09.864
and I ain't coming back.

41:09.866 --> 41:11.465
Listen,

41:11.467 --> 41:14.502
playing the good guy
ain't for me, okay?

41:14.504 --> 41:16.805
'Cause it costs too much.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.940
Sorry to break it to you,
but you're always gonna be

41:18.942 --> 41:21.375
one of the good guys,
no matter how far

41:21.377 --> 41:23.644
off the reservation you go.

41:26.816 --> 41:27.981
Oh, boy.

41:27.983 --> 41:29.950
That's my signal to scram.

41:29.952 --> 41:32.353
Stay out of trouble.
All right.

41:32.355 --> 41:33.821
You, too, buddy.
Take care, my brother.

41:33.823 --> 41:35.823
You know where to find me.
Yeah.

41:35.825 --> 41:38.025
God, I hope don't have to.

41:40.129 --> 41:42.896

41:42.898 --> 41:45.498

41:45.500 --> 41:49.569
Don't pull the Southern
hospitality on me.

41:49.571 --> 41:51.671
I'm not thirsty.

41:51.673 --> 41:54.140
Talked to Isler.

41:54.142 --> 41:55.875
Said I'm gonna be attached
to your team.

41:55.877 --> 41:57.009
Temporarily.

41:57.011 --> 41:58.311
You help our cases,

41:58.313 --> 42:01.481
we help you with Ciudad Natal
until they're neutralized.

42:01.483 --> 42:03.683
Otherwise, we're just gonna
keep running into each other.

42:03.685 --> 42:05.318
Like you said, small town.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.420
And this was your idea?

42:07.422 --> 42:08.688
You're stuck here.

42:08.690 --> 42:10.256
I'm a man down.

42:10.258 --> 42:11.958
Why would you even want me?

42:11.960 --> 42:13.525
I was investigating you.

42:13.527 --> 42:16.863
When the chips were down,
you stepped up, backed my calls.

42:16.865 --> 42:20.900
Come on, we both want this
to be over with.

42:20.902 --> 42:22.769
I just want to go home.

42:22.771 --> 42:24.103
Work with us.

42:24.105 --> 42:25.871

ferret out the cartel.

42:25.873 --> 42:28.206
You'll be back
in D.C. in no time.

42:28.208 --> 42:29.375
I'll get my city back.

42:29.377 --> 42:30.842
