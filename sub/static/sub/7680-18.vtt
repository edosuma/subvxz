(vehicle approaching)

01:24.150 --> 01:25.652
Okay, hold it
right there.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.660
Let's check out
the merchandise.
All right.

01:35.662 --> 01:38.164
Let's see if we got
what we paid for, huh?

01:43.670 --> 01:45.171
Looks like a missile to me.

01:45.171 --> 01:46.673
All right!

01:51.177 --> 01:53.680
(grunts)

02:10.196 --> 02:12.699
(grunts)

02:12.699 --> 02:14.701

(men shouting below)

02:17.704 --> 02:18.204
Inside!

03:06.753 --> 03:09.756
MAN:
That's great.
Okay, I'll see you.

03:17.764 --> 03:21.267
(loud, indistinct chatter)

03:52.298 --> 03:53.299
Excuse me.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.802
Yeah, what's happening?

03:58.304 --> 04:00.306
MAN:
Do it, man, do it!

04:07.814 --> 04:08.815
Oh, yeah.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.316
MAN:
Yeah! Yeah...

04:10.316 --> 04:11.818
Yeah.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.320
(applause and cheering)

04:17.824 --> 04:19.826
MAN:
It was
great, man.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.328
Professor Willis,

04:22.328 --> 04:24.831
this drink is from
that man right there.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.333
(loud, indistinct chatter)

04:27.333 --> 04:29.335
(laughing)

04:33.339 --> 04:35.842
My favorite drink.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.343
You remembered, Mac.

04:37.343 --> 04:40.847
Who's he with now?

04:42.849 --> 04:44.350
Get the car.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.352
Tell Hank we may have
another one to deal with.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.854
Okay.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.856
Mac, the answer is no.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.858
You don't even
know what I want yet.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.359
Sure I do.

04:53.359 --> 04:55.862
You want the answer
to the glitch I discovered

04:55.862 --> 04:57.864
in the Army's Snake-eye
missile's guidance system.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.866
Or how to fix it, correct?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.868
That's part of it.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.369
And they sent you to me

05:03.369 --> 05:06.372
because they figure
you have some pull with me.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.874
Don't I?

05:08.875 --> 05:11.377
Yeah, you do.

05:11.377 --> 05:14.380
Professor, "they" said

05:14.380 --> 05:16.883
you had one of your students
work on the problem with you.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.886
Just like we did
when you were in my classes.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.388
Well, yeah, but I don't remember
ever breaking in

05:22.388 --> 05:24.891
to the Defense Department's
computer.

05:24.891 --> 05:27.393
Now, that was innocent
eagerness, Mac.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.396
Kate saw the problem,
went for the solution.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.398
Now, you do remember

05:32.398 --> 05:35.401
having that passion
to find solutions, don't you?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.904
Yes, sir, I guess I do.

05:37.904 --> 05:41.908
She's a bona fide genius, Mac.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.910
Mm. But she's also
still just a kid.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.412
My people just want
to talk to her, Professor.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.915
Now, I will not
give them anything

05:48.915 --> 05:52.418
until I get their word of honor
they'll leave her alone.

05:52.418 --> 05:55.421
Yes, that's what I remember
about you, Professor.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.423
The student always came first.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.926
Well,

05:59.926 --> 06:03.429
good ones like Kate--
they are rare.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.431
Then there's MacGyvers
who have to have

06:05.431 --> 06:06.933
their brains rattled
every now and then

06:06.933 --> 06:08.434
just to make sure
they're still in tune.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.936
Yes, sir.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.938
Well, the best brain
rattler was always

06:11.938 --> 06:14.440
listening to you howl
away on a saxophone.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.442
(laughs)

06:16.442 --> 06:19.946
Merely an indulgence just
to regenerate the mind.

06:19.946 --> 06:20.947
Uh-huh.

06:20.947 --> 06:21.948
Go ahead, arrange it.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.950
Arrange a meeting.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.952
When I get assurances
from everyone

06:25.952 --> 06:28.955
that there will not be
any nastiness, then we'll talk

06:28.955 --> 06:31.958
about turning over the answers
to the guidance system.

06:39.465 --> 06:40.466
Here you are.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.468
Oh, thank you.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.472
WOMAN:
I want to go
to his concert.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.474
MAN:
Oh, yeah,
definitely.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.978
(car engine approaching)

06:51.978 --> 06:52.979
(brakes squealing)

06:52.979 --> 06:54.480
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:54.480 --> 06:55.481
Get into the car!

06:55.481 --> 06:56.983
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

06:56.983 --> 06:57.984
Grab the old goat.
Hey.

06:57.984 --> 06:58.985
(muttering)

06:58.985 --> 07:00.486
Hey!

07:00.486 --> 07:01.487
What?

07:01.487 --> 07:03.489
(gunshot)

07:03.489 --> 07:04.490
Get down.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.992
(groans)

07:05.992 --> 07:08.494
Give me that!

07:10.496 --> 07:12.498
(car alarm wailing)

07:12.498 --> 07:14.000
(grunting, gunshot)

07:14.000 --> 07:15.001
(Willis groans)

07:15.001 --> 07:16.502
(groaning)

07:16.502 --> 07:17.503
Get in the car!
Let's hit it!

07:17.503 --> 07:19.505
Yeah, right!

07:19.505 --> 07:21.507
(tires screeching)

07:23.009 --> 07:24.510
(groaning)

07:24.510 --> 07:25.511
Professor.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.513
(groans)

07:27.513 --> 07:28.514
MAN:
You all right?

07:28.514 --> 07:30.016
You think they didn't
like my music?

07:30.016 --> 07:31.517
(coughing)
I'll get an ambulance.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.519
No. No, don't bother.

07:33.519 --> 07:36.022
No. "'Tis not so
deep as a well,

07:36.022 --> 07:38.024
"nor so wide as
a church door,

07:38.024 --> 07:40.526
but 'tis enough,
t'will serve."

07:40.526 --> 07:42.028
Yes, sir.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.529
But you have one
of the finest minds

07:43.529 --> 07:45.031
I have ever
encountered.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.032
Young man,

07:46.032 --> 07:48.534
I expect you to... to...

08:05.051 --> 08:09.055
(siren blaring)

08:24.570 --> 08:27.573
MacGYVER:
He was the toughest professor
I ever had,

08:27.573 --> 08:29.575
and everybody loved him.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.077
I'm sorry, Mac.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.078
I know how much he meant to you.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.580
Listen, are you sure

08:34.580 --> 08:36.582
that they just meant
to grab him?

08:36.582 --> 08:38.083
That gunshot was an accident?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.586
Yeah, I'm positive.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.587
Pete, how important
was that system

08:42.587 --> 08:45.091
he was working on?

08:45.091 --> 08:47.593
It was meant as an upgrade
for the old Snake-eye missile.

08:47.593 --> 08:51.097
Extended range, variable use,
pinpoint accuracy.

08:51.097 --> 08:55.101
Well, now the Snake-eye is
a surface-to-air heat-seeker.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.603
You tellin' me this system
makes it programmable?

08:57.603 --> 08:59.105
Surface to
anytarget?

08:59.105 --> 09:00.606
Listen, with that new
guidance system,

09:00.606 --> 09:02.608
you tell it
to take out a building,

09:02.608 --> 09:03.609
it'll ask you which floor

09:03.609 --> 09:05.111
and what room.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.612
Oh my God.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.614
Why?

09:08.614 --> 09:10.616
Many of these
things in surplus?

09:10.616 --> 09:11.617
(scoffs)

09:11.617 --> 09:13.119
Too many.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.121
It's a real commodity
among the Third World nations.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.622
The people in the
arms black market

09:16.622 --> 09:18.124
are ripping
each other off

09:18.124 --> 09:19.125
for their
stockpiles.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.126
There have been
some rumors

09:20.626 --> 09:22.128
of underworld
hijackings.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.130
Well, that actually kind of
makes sense.

09:24.130 --> 09:27.133
With the Professor's new system,
the value would triple.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.634
Yeah.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.137
Gives you some idea of why
they tried to snatch him up.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.639
Exactly, and now
with Willis dead...

09:33.639 --> 09:35.641
They could go after the student.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.143
Yeah.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.144
Mac, where
are you going?

09:38.144 --> 09:39.645
Well, I'm gonna find her.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.147
That kid could be
in a lot of trouble.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.149
She alreadyis.The Office
of Defense Intelligence

09:43.149 --> 09:44.650
wants to put their hands on her

09:44.650 --> 09:46.152
for breaking
into their computer system.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.153
Oh, terrific.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.655
And we all know
what wonderful people they are.

09:49.655 --> 09:52.658
Mac, now, you're not
cooking around with some idea

09:52.658 --> 09:54.660
about getting in their way,
are you?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.662
Pete, I owe it
to Professor Willis.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.665
He wanted this girl protected,
and I'm gonna do it.

09:59.665 --> 10:00.666
Now, wait
a minute.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.168
So, best of luck.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.669
I'm a phone call away
if you need me...

10:03.669 --> 10:05.171
I know all that, Pete. Thanks.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.172
Stay out of trouble.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.173
Keep expenses down.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.674
Come back alive.

10:08.674 --> 10:09.675
(chuckles)

10:09.675 --> 10:12.178
Took the words right out
of my mouth.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.683
(chuckles)

10:17.683 --> 10:21.187
MAN:
So, where do we go from here?

10:21.187 --> 10:22.188
Seems everybody in town knew

10:22.688 --> 10:24.690
the professor was working
on that guidance system

10:24.690 --> 10:25.691
with one of his students.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.694
If we can find that student,
we may have our answer.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.696
You got a name?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.198
I'll do what
needs doin'.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.699
Nothing useful.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.202
But I have another edge.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.708
His name is MacGyver.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.710
He's one of the government's
top bloodhounds.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.712
I've seen this guy.

10:46.712 --> 10:47.713
He was with the professor.

10:47.713 --> 10:48.714
Good.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.216
Find him...

10:50.216 --> 10:51.717
and we may have the student.

11:17.743 --> 11:20.246
I loved him, too.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.751
This was my desk
here in the corner.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.753
There's a heater back there.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.255
I'm no dummy.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.756
Yeah?

11:30.756 --> 11:32.258
Yeah, for two years.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.260
I spent some of the best times
of my life

11:34.260 --> 11:35.761
right here in
this classroom

11:35.761 --> 11:37.263
with Professor Willis.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.265
Me, too.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.766
I got a feeling I
was a little older

11:41.267 --> 11:42.268
than you,
though, Kate.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.271
You are Kate,
aren't you?

11:45.771 --> 11:46.772
How do you know?

11:46.772 --> 11:48.274
He mentioned
you last night.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.275
You were with him when...

11:49.275 --> 11:51.277
Yeah.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.778
You were waiting here
for me, weren't you?

11:52.778 --> 11:55.281
I was hopin', yeah.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.782
For what?

11:56.782 --> 11:58.784
We got to talk, Kate.

11:58.784 --> 11:59.785
About that project

11:59.785 --> 12:01.787
you and the professor
were working on.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.292
I got to go.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.294
I'll give you a lift.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.295
Why?

12:09.795 --> 12:11.797
I like hanging out
with friendly people.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.800
Let me get that for you.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.802
You built these satellite maps?

12:16.802 --> 12:18.804
KATE:
Yeah.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.806
Telesat five?

12:20.806 --> 12:23.309
Navsat, Westar five?

12:23.309 --> 12:25.311
You follow all
the communications satellites,

12:25.811 --> 12:26.812
know their positions?

12:26.812 --> 12:29.315
I do okay. So what?

12:29.315 --> 12:31.317
Kate, why are you so rude
to Mr. MacGyver?

12:31.317 --> 12:33.819
I think it has
something to do

12:33.819 --> 12:37.323
with defense mechanisms,
Mrs. Lafferty-- hers.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.325
Is all of this
in honor of something?

12:39.325 --> 12:41.327
Oh, you bet it is.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.329
In order for you
to help solve the problem

12:43.329 --> 12:44.830
with the guidance system,
you had to break

12:44.830 --> 12:46.832
into a top secret
computer net

12:46.832 --> 12:49.835
just chock full
of classified information.

12:49.835 --> 12:50.836
Now, correct me
if I'm wrong,

12:51.337 --> 12:53.339
but in this country,
I think that's a no-no.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.341
Is that true?

12:55.341 --> 12:57.343
Take it easy, Mom.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.345
The man is overreacting.

12:59.345 --> 13:00.846
What to they think
I'm going to do,

13:00.846 --> 13:01.847
tell it to the Russians
or something?

13:01.847 --> 13:02.848
Look, will you
just knock that chip

13:02.848 --> 13:04.350
off your shoulder
for a second?

13:04.350 --> 13:05.851
Just listen to me.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.353
The government's
a little embarrassed
(knocking)

13:07.353 --> 13:09.855
by your antics.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.359
Office of Defense
Intelligence, ma'am.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.360
Is your daughter at home?

13:14.360 --> 13:15.861
What's this all about?

13:15.861 --> 13:16.862
Who are you?

13:16.862 --> 13:18.364
Name's MacGyver.

13:18.364 --> 13:19.865
Are you a relative
or something?

13:19.865 --> 13:22.368
Something.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.369
Come in.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.871
They're legit. O.D.I.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.376
Are you Kate Lafferty?

13:30.376 --> 13:32.378
Now, just what
do you want with her?

13:32.378 --> 13:34.880
We just want to have
a little chat with her,
ma'am, downtown.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.882
You guys got a charge?

13:36.882 --> 13:39.885
No, not yet.
We just want to talk.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.887
You push it,
we'll get a warrant.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.889
Darling, I think
you better go.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.391
They-they just want
to ask a few questions.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.393
No! I'm not going
to go anywhere!

13:47.393 --> 13:48.394
Take it easy, Kate.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.895
I think your mom's right.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.897
You should go with 'em.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.899
But don't worry,
we'll get you out.

13:53.899 --> 13:54.900
When will she be back?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.402
Well, that all depends
on her, ma'am.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.903
It could be she'll be out
right away.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.406
Then again, it might be
quite some time.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.908
Let's go, Kate.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.418
MAN:
All right, Kate,
let's try it again.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.420
Why don't we start
with how you gained access

14:14.420 --> 14:15.921
to the Snake-eye project?

14:15.921 --> 14:17.923
Maybe we ought
to get me a lawyer

14:17.923 --> 14:19.425
before we start talking
about anything.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.427
Now, look, kid,
this is not an
inquisition.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.428
You're not charged.
Not yet.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.430
All we want are a
few serious answers

14:24.430 --> 14:26.432
to a few serious questions.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.433
KATE:
I have nothing
to say.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.936
Now, look... you want
to cooperate here and now,

14:30.936 --> 14:32.938
or do you want to look
at some heavy conspiracy charges

14:33.439 --> 14:34.940
and explain them
to a judge?

14:39.445 --> 14:40.946
Okay.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.449
What do you want?

14:44.450 --> 14:45.451
To start with,
I want to know

14:45.451 --> 14:47.453
how you broke through
the computer security system.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.959
All right.

14:55.961 --> 14:56.962
I'll show you.

14:56.962 --> 14:58.964
Can I use your computer?

14:58.964 --> 14:59.965
Be my guest.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.978
Password?

15:15.981 --> 15:18.484
It'll save time.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.488
Lippencott.

15:32.498 --> 15:35.501
"Data inventory..."

15:38.504 --> 15:42.007
"Pershing, Phoenix, Hawk..."

15:42.007 --> 15:44.009
Hmm, "Sidewinder...

15:44.009 --> 15:47.513
Harpoon..." Yeah. Snake-eye.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.023
Okay, now I got to get
into the sub-program.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.028
MacGYVER:
Aw, come on, Pete,

16:03.028 --> 16:05.531
she broke security
to help Professor Willis

16:05.531 --> 16:07.533
help the United States
government solve a problem.

16:07.533 --> 16:11.036
It's not like she was selling
the Pentagon to Gorbachev.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.538
I know, Mac,
but it's not exactly like

16:12.538 --> 16:15.541
she stole an apple
off a pushcart, either.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.042
All right, all right...
but I'm telling you,

16:17.042 --> 16:19.044
Kate is not going
to tell them one thing

16:19.044 --> 16:21.547
about the guidance system
or anything else,
for that matter,

16:21.547 --> 16:23.549
until they stop treating her
like Qaddafi's hit man.

16:23.549 --> 16:27.553
Mac, you are probably reading
the girl right, but I...

16:27.553 --> 16:29.054
Pete...

16:29.054 --> 16:30.556
I'll make a deal with you.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.559
(chuckles):
I don't think I like
the sound of that,

16:33.559 --> 16:35.060
but I'm listening.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.563
I'll get both answers for us,

16:37.563 --> 16:40.566
providing you get the O.D.I.
off her back.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.068
How she accessed their computer

16:43.068 --> 16:45.571
and what the fix
on that guidance system was.

16:45.571 --> 16:46.572
Mac, I don't know

16:46.572 --> 16:48.574
if I can keep
my end of it.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.576
Well, I'm not sure
I can swing my end,

16:50.576 --> 16:52.077
but I'm willing
to give it my best shot.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.579
How 'bout you?

16:53.579 --> 16:56.582
(chuckling)

16:56.582 --> 16:58.083
Agreed.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.586
All right, Pete.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.590
KATE:
We're in.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.098
Great. Just like that.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.099
ROGERS:
I can't believe it--
we have got

17:15.099 --> 17:16.101
to tighten security.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.104
OSLOW:
New access codes for
the whole program.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.608
ROGERS:
Thanks a lot, kid.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.628
How long is this
going to take?

17:42.628 --> 17:45.130
It took me three weeks
the first time to break in.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.633
Cool down.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.138
Oh, terrific.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.143
OSLOW:
Are you getting
anything yet?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.646
KATE:
Right now.

18:00.646 --> 18:01.647
WOMAN 1:
What's going on here?

18:01.647 --> 18:03.649
WOMAN 2:
I don't know.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.651
This is crazy.
It's going berserk!

18:06.652 --> 18:08.654
(computer keys clicking)

18:14.660 --> 18:16.161
Hey!
Hey!

18:21.166 --> 18:22.668
(man whistling)

18:22.668 --> 18:24.670
(buzzing)
Come on.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.182
WOMAN:
What's all this?

18:40.185 --> 18:41.687
(alarm ringing)

18:42.187 --> 18:43.689
Hey, that's the fire alarm!

18:46.191 --> 18:48.694
KATE:
I'm getting interference.

18:48.694 --> 18:49.695
OSLOW:
Call Maintenance.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.196
ROGERS:
I'll get right on it.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.703
OSLOW:
What the hell's
going on here?

18:57.703 --> 18:59.204
ROGERS:
All right, just
take-take it easy.

18:59.204 --> 19:02.207
The emergency
generator'll kick
in in a second.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.715
HATCHER:
Stop worrying.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.717
The missiles will be delivered
as promised.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.722
The delivery is not
what concerns me.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.723
Oh?

19:17.723 --> 19:19.224
There's an ugly
rumor going around

19:19.224 --> 19:23.729
that, uh, the
missile's guidance
system doesn't work.

19:23.729 --> 19:27.232
It doesn't... but it will.

19:27.232 --> 19:30.235
That's not good enough,
Mr. Hatcher.

19:30.235 --> 19:32.738
My people want a demonstration

19:32.738 --> 19:34.239
just to be sure.

19:34.239 --> 19:36.742
There was nothing in our deal
about a demonstration.

19:36.742 --> 19:39.745
No demonstration, no money.

19:40.746 --> 19:41.747
What do you want us to hit?

19:42.748 --> 19:44.750
I haven't decided yet,

19:44.750 --> 19:47.753
but I'll think up something...

19:47.753 --> 19:51.256
imaginative.

19:56.261 --> 20:00.265
Hey, what are you doing
in here?

20:00.265 --> 20:03.268
I could ask you
the same thing.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.770
I thought you were
being detained.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.271
Well, they thought so, too.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.774
They started threatening
all sorts of dumb things.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.275
I think they thought I
was some kind of dodo.

20:10.776 --> 20:11.276
So I left.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.278
How'd you manage that?

20:13.278 --> 20:15.781
I screwed up their
environmental control system.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.784
Oh.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.788
Why didn't you
just give 'em the answers?

20:22.788 --> 20:23.789
'Cause...

20:23.789 --> 20:24.790
they've got no right

20:24.790 --> 20:26.291
to treat me like a criminal.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.794
And because I want some answers,
too, about Professor Willis.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.295
I don't see anybody
doing anything

20:30.295 --> 20:31.797
about trying to find
his murderers.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.298
It's being done.
Yeah, by who?

20:33.298 --> 20:35.300
Friends of mine.
They'll find the killers.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.301
You're sure?

20:36.301 --> 20:38.804
I guarantee it.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.806
But in the meantime,
why don't you help them

20:40.806 --> 20:42.307
fix this guidance system?

20:42.307 --> 20:44.309
I mean, the answer
is in here, isn't it?

20:44.309 --> 20:47.813
Sure... but you'll never get in.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.314
That's what you're trying
to do, isn't it,

20:49.314 --> 20:50.315
break in?

20:50.315 --> 20:52.818
Yes.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.826
You're trying
to break in using

21:01.326 --> 21:02.327
thesepasswords?

21:03.328 --> 21:04.830
Too easy?

21:04.830 --> 21:06.832
It's not my style.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.333
What's your style?

21:08.333 --> 21:09.835
That's your problem.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.337
I'm sure you
can solve it.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.348
Is what your mom said true:

21:23.348 --> 21:26.351
you don't have
any friends?

21:26.351 --> 21:27.853
Who needs 'em?

21:27.853 --> 21:30.355
All they do is tease me
about being an egghead.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.867
Kind of hurts, huh?

21:41.867 --> 21:44.369
What do you know about it?

21:46.872 --> 21:49.374
Look, I'm not pretty,
and the boys that do notice me--

21:49.374 --> 21:50.876
they run like rabbits
when they find out

21:50.876 --> 21:52.377
I'm smarter than they are.

21:52.377 --> 21:54.880
So you just decided
to go it alone, is that it?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.882
What is this,
some kind of
shrink session?

21:56.882 --> 21:57.883
All right, all right.

22:03.388 --> 22:04.890
There is a password,
right?

22:04.890 --> 22:05.891
Sure.

22:12.397 --> 22:15.400
But you're not even close.
(laughs)

22:15.400 --> 22:19.404
You know, you're a very
pretty girl when you smile.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.407
Give me a break, will you?

22:22.407 --> 22:24.409
I'm not!

22:24.409 --> 22:26.912
And you know it.
Everybody knows it. I know it.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.914
I'm nowhere even close
to being pretty. I'm...

22:31.416 --> 22:34.419
I'm...

23:00.946 --> 23:03.949
That's mean.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.956
(sniffles)

23:10.956 --> 23:14.960
Boy, you are not seeing
who you really are, Kate.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.461
You're wrong!

23:16.962 --> 23:18.463
I know who I am
and what I am,

23:18.463 --> 23:19.464
and you do, too. Look!

23:19.965 --> 23:21.967
That'syourpassword...

23:21.967 --> 23:23.969
and I don't happen
to believe it for a second.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.470
Well, it's the truth.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.472
I'm ugly, and I'm weird,

23:27.472 --> 23:29.474
and I don't even care
if anybody likes me or not!

23:29.474 --> 23:31.476
You are not ugly.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.979
And will you please stop
putting yourself down?

23:36.982 --> 23:38.984
You are special, Kate.

23:40.485 --> 23:43.488
And it's not so bad
to be special.

23:43.989 --> 23:45.991
You just have to learn to feel
good about it, that's all.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.995
Well, I don't, okay?

23:52.497 --> 23:55.000
Here, make the copy.

23:55.500 --> 23:59.504
The file name is "guidance",
with a PGM extension.

24:03.508 --> 24:05.010
(garbled transmission)

24:05.510 --> 24:08.513
"Guidance".

24:09.514 --> 24:12.017
Shh. Come on, Kate.

24:12.017 --> 24:15.520
(turns radio off)

24:18.523 --> 24:20.525
All right.

24:23.528 --> 24:25.530
Let's go.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.534
Whoops!

24:29.534 --> 24:31.036
MacGYVER:
Storeroom, quick!

24:43.548 --> 24:46.051
Pull this out
and plug it in.

24:46.051 --> 24:48.553
Sound oscillator?

24:48.553 --> 24:51.056
Yeah, I'm gonna give them
a royal pain in the ear.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.557
(pounding)

25:01.066 --> 25:02.067
Here, protect
your ears.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.068
There!

25:03.068 --> 25:04.069
Right!

25:04.069 --> 25:05.570
(grunting)

25:14.579 --> 25:17.082
(high-pitched squeal)

25:17.082 --> 25:18.583
(yelling)

25:28.093 --> 25:31.096
MacGyver, stop! The plug!

25:31.096 --> 25:33.598
Mac, stop! The plug!

25:33.598 --> 25:35.100
(squealing stops)

25:35.100 --> 25:36.601
Hold it!

25:39.604 --> 25:41.606
Well, it was
a good idea.

25:43.108 --> 25:43.608
Turn around.

25:44.109 --> 25:45.610
You know, you and I should talk.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.113
What do you
say we...

26:08.934 --> 26:12.437
MacGYVER:
They say sleep is relaxing.

26:12.437 --> 26:16.441
Well, not all the time.

26:18.944 --> 26:22.948
It's become apparent that Kate
and I think a lot alike.

26:22.948 --> 26:27.452
And if that's the case, I gotta
believe she's left me a clue.

26:36.962 --> 26:41.466
(typing)

26:41.466 --> 26:43.468
Duckling...

26:54.479 --> 26:55.981
Boy, she's good.

26:56.982 --> 27:00.986
SAR-SAT, 243 megahertz.

27:00.986 --> 27:02.988
Very good.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.009
Yeah, FAA?

27:24.009 --> 27:25.510
This is MacGyver.

27:25.510 --> 27:32.017
Uh, DXS.
ID number X-C 4479.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.519
Yeah, right.

27:34.519 --> 27:37.022
Yeah, I got this little problem,

27:37.022 --> 27:40.525
and I think your SAR-SAT
satellite can help me with it.

27:41.026 --> 27:43.028
Yeah, right.

27:43.028 --> 27:46.031
Signal's probably coming
from a portable radio

27:46.031 --> 27:50.035
modified to a transceiver
on 243 megahertz.

27:50.035 --> 27:55.540
Okay, I need you to scan
the Western United States.

27:58.043 --> 28:00.045
You will?

28:00.045 --> 28:02.047
What can I say?

28:02.047 --> 28:03.548
You guys are terrific.

28:10.555 --> 28:13.058
(beeping)

28:18.063 --> 28:21.066
(footsteps approaching)

28:27.572 --> 28:30.575
I haven't got time to
play games, young lady.

28:30.575 --> 28:34.579
I will find out about
the guidance system.

28:34.579 --> 28:36.081
Sodium pentathol.

28:36.081 --> 28:38.083
Your choice.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.584
With or without.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.086
Be sensible.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.089
Tell Mr. Walker
what to do.

28:48.093 --> 28:51.596
One of the great things
about satellite navigation

28:51.596 --> 28:55.600
is that they can pinpoint
a location down to 100 yards.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.604
Problem is,
 they still can't tell

28:59.604 --> 29:01.606
who's liable
to be waiting there.

29:12.617 --> 29:15.120
WALKER:
So where's this baby gonna go?

29:15.120 --> 29:19.124
HATCHER:
Anyplace between Canada
and the Mexican border.

29:19.124 --> 29:20.625
Get the missile in place.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.628
You're gonna use it here,

29:23.628 --> 29:25.130
in the United States?

29:28.633 --> 29:30.135
Just a little test to make sure

29:30.135 --> 29:31.636
everything works
the way it should.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.138
When do I get to go?

29:33.138 --> 29:34.639
After the test.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.142
Lock her up!

29:48.653 --> 29:50.155
Move it!

29:50.155 --> 29:53.158
Come on! Get!

31:07.232 --> 31:09.234
(grunting)

31:18.743 --> 31:20.745
Couple hours and you'll be okay.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.263
Kate!

31:38.263 --> 31:39.764
Kate!

31:39.764 --> 31:40.765
MacGyver!

31:41.266 --> 31:42.767
Don't touch that
bar, it's hot!

31:42.767 --> 31:43.768
Hey, nice job.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.270
Real nice.

31:45.270 --> 31:47.772
Sure, but I'm gonna get fried
trying to squeeze through.

31:49.774 --> 31:50.775
All right, hang on.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.793
Spray cans use hydrocarbons.

32:08.793 --> 32:10.795
Ought to cool the bars down.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.802
Stand back.

32:30.815 --> 32:33.818
KATE:
They were gonna give me
sodium pentathol

32:33.818 --> 32:36.321
and they made me fix
the guidance system.

32:36.821 --> 32:38.323
I had no choice.

32:38.323 --> 32:39.824
That truck
I saw leaving

32:39.824 --> 32:41.326
had a tarp on it.

32:41.326 --> 32:42.827
Was the missile
under that?

32:42.827 --> 32:44.329
Yes, only they don't
know the target yet.

32:44.329 --> 32:46.831
The head honcho said he
would radio the coordinates

32:46.831 --> 32:47.832
as soon as he got them.

32:47.832 --> 32:49.834
So they're staying
in touch by radio, eh?

32:49.834 --> 32:50.835
I guess.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.837
This is all my fault, isn't it?

32:53.338 --> 32:55.340
I mean, if I hadn't broken
into that stupid com...

32:55.340 --> 32:57.842
Hey...
I never did anything
like this before.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.844
Believe me. I only did it
to help professor Willis.

32:59.844 --> 33:03.348
Look, everybody makes
mistakes once in a while.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.851
The trick is learning
to live with it.

33:06.851 --> 33:10.355
Like we all do.

33:10.355 --> 33:14.359
Even if you
are special.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.362
MacGyver?

33:17.362 --> 33:18.863
Yeah?

33:21.866 --> 33:22.867
You're the first real...

33:22.867 --> 33:24.369
What?

33:24.369 --> 33:25.370
Forget it.

33:25.370 --> 33:26.371
Friend?

33:28.373 --> 33:29.374
I guess.

33:29.374 --> 33:31.376
I am honored.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.877
Now you're making fun of me.

33:32.877 --> 33:33.878
No way!

33:33.878 --> 33:37.382
Friendship is something
I don't take lightly.

33:37.382 --> 33:39.884
It's too hard
to come by.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.886
You mean it?

33:41.886 --> 33:44.389
Yes, ma'am.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.401
Why are we stopping?

33:56.401 --> 33:58.903
The more time we take
the further away they get.

33:58.903 --> 34:02.907
Yeah, but they are staying
in contact by radio, right?

34:04.909 --> 34:05.910
Yeah.

34:05.910 --> 34:08.413
Come on, Kate, if you
don't get it,

34:08.413 --> 34:10.915
you're not as smart
as I think you are.

34:10.915 --> 34:12.917
I'll get it,
I'll get it.

34:19.424 --> 34:20.925
Triangulation, right?

34:20.925 --> 34:21.926
Good girl.

34:21.926 --> 34:23.428
We can use the radio
in the Jeep.

34:23.428 --> 34:24.929
And the one in your pocket.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.431
And we can use the coils
from the speakers.

34:27.431 --> 34:29.434
MacGYVER:
And the battery
from the Jeep for one.

34:29.434 --> 34:31.936
Oh, no, the battery
is dead.

34:31.936 --> 34:34.438
I had it on the whole
time for SAR-SAT.

34:34.938 --> 34:36.440
Oh...

34:36.440 --> 34:38.943
All right...

34:38.943 --> 34:41.946
We'll use the acid
from the cactus.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.447
It's got electrolytes,
and we've got

34:43.447 --> 34:45.449
two different kinds
of wire from the Jeep.

34:45.449 --> 34:46.951
So we have power for the radio!

34:46.951 --> 34:48.953
And we'll use our
watches and the sun...

34:48.953 --> 34:50.455
To get the direction.

34:50.455 --> 34:51.956
Is right!
Great!

34:52.456 --> 34:53.458
All for one...

34:53.458 --> 34:54.958
And one for all!

34:54.958 --> 34:56.460
I can't believe you said that.

35:01.966 --> 35:05.470
The liquid in the cactus'll
give us a low-level current.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.472
That ought to be all we need.

35:29.494 --> 35:30.995
Eagle to Nest, Eagle to Nest.

35:31.496 --> 35:32.497
I'm in position. Over.

35:32.497 --> 35:34.499
HATCHER:
Nest to Eagle, stand by.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.000
Be with you in a minute.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.001
Everything's ready.

35:37.001 --> 35:38.503
All we need are
the coordinates. Over.

35:51.516 --> 35:54.519
These loops'll form
a directional antenna.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.020
Excellent.

35:59.023 --> 36:03.027
Our antennas will form two
points of the triangle.

36:03.027 --> 36:05.029
KATE:
The third point
is where they are.

36:05.029 --> 36:06.531
That's right.

36:06.531 --> 36:09.033
And if we're lucky, we'll
pick up their voices.

36:09.033 --> 36:12.537
(static)

36:17.542 --> 36:21.045
(static crackling
over whirring frequencies)

36:23.047 --> 36:24.048
(garbled voices come in)

36:24.048 --> 36:25.049
LARKIN:
Not yet.

36:25.049 --> 36:26.551
I'll read you the data.

36:26.551 --> 36:27.552
We got 'em!

36:27.552 --> 36:29.053
Yeah, but do we have 'em
in time?

36:29.053 --> 36:30.555
...waiting for this
to come in...

36:30.555 --> 36:32.056
Sounds like they're
getting ready to fire.

36:32.056 --> 36:34.058
Give me a preliminary...
Listen, point your watch

36:34.058 --> 36:37.061
to the north, and align
the antenna with it.

36:37.061 --> 36:40.565
So we can calibrate
directionally.

36:40.565 --> 36:41.566
Yes, ma'am.

36:41.566 --> 36:42.567
HATCHER:
Prepare launch sequence.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.068
You compensated
with radian, Eagle?

36:44.068 --> 36:46.070
LARKIN:
I'm compensated.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.572
Circuitry check in progress.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.075
HATCHER:
Any anomalies?

36:51.075 --> 36:52.577
LARKIN:
Zero, zero.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.078
They're coming in
at 2:00.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.581
(Hatcher and
Larkin speaking)
Mine's comin' in at 11:00.

36:56.581 --> 37:00.084
And where they cross
is where the missile is.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.086
HATCHER:
Last check, Eagle. Stand by.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.092
Well, I trust the baby is well?

37:08.092 --> 37:09.093
HATCHER:
She is.

37:09.093 --> 37:11.095
She's been checked
and rechecked.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.598
All we need now
are the coordinates.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.600
Then she'll be off
like a hungry vulture.

37:16.100 --> 37:19.604
Program the guidance
control to...

37:19.604 --> 37:23.608
37 degrees, 47 minutes north,

37:24.108 --> 37:28.112
122 degrees, 30 minutes west.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.616
122 degrees,
30 minutes west.

37:33.117 --> 37:35.119
Somewhere in the South Bay,
isn't it?

37:35.119 --> 37:37.121
Very good, Mr. Hatcher.

37:37.121 --> 37:38.623
What's the specific target?

37:38.623 --> 37:42.627
The Clinton Narrows Bridge.

37:42.627 --> 37:44.629
I contacted the buyers
and told 'em

37:44.629 --> 37:46.631
they'd be hearing
about the demonstration

37:46.631 --> 37:48.633
around 1:30 this afternoon.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.135
Traffic count is lowest then.

37:51.135 --> 37:53.137
Have a good day.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.139
Did you get that?

37:55.139 --> 37:56.140
Got it.

37:56.641 --> 37:59.143
Why's he want to
take out the Clinton
Narrows Bridge?

37:59.644 --> 38:01.145
HATCHER:
It's part of the marketing plan.

38:01.145 --> 38:02.146
It'll get a lot of press.

38:02.146 --> 38:03.147
Customers will see

38:03.147 --> 38:06.150
that they've got a good product.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.152
LARKIN:
Roger, Nest.
They're going to take out

38:08.152 --> 38:09.654
the Clinton Narrows Bridge!

38:09.654 --> 38:11.656
Proceeding with launch sequence
as instructed.

38:11.656 --> 38:15.159
Eagle out.
Yeah, in 27 minutes.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.160
Oh, my God.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.161
KATE:
What?

38:17.161 --> 38:19.664
The South Bay Marathon's today.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.666
There'll be thousands of runners
on that bridge.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.167
How do you know that?

38:23.167 --> 38:25.670
Because I've
run it twice.

38:27.171 --> 38:29.173
(cheering)

39:03.708 --> 39:07.211
MacGyver, there's got
to be something we can do.

39:07.211 --> 39:08.212
Yeah.

39:08.212 --> 39:11.716
The question is
what and how.

39:20.725 --> 39:23.227
WALKER:
Larkin, come here.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.733
If we could get our hands
on that shotgun...

39:28.733 --> 39:31.235
Nah, it's a little too
wide open down there.

39:31.235 --> 39:33.237
I've never had much
use for guns anyway.

39:33.237 --> 39:34.739
KATE:
Well, then what are
we going to do?

39:35.239 --> 39:36.741
MacGYVER:
We're going to assess
the problem,

39:36.741 --> 39:38.242
then come up
with a solution.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.744
That's usually
how it's done.

39:39.744 --> 39:42.246
Yes, if you have
enough time...

39:42.246 --> 39:44.749
and we've only got 12 minutes.

39:44.749 --> 39:47.752
(spectators cheering)

39:57.762 --> 40:01.766
You know, maybe that
shotgun could be useful.

40:01.766 --> 40:04.268
Harness a little of
the power from the sun,

40:04.268 --> 40:05.770
heat it up a tad.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.773
If we had a harness.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.275
What do you think
a Jeep's got?

40:11.275 --> 40:12.777
Energy.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.278
Yeah.

40:22.286 --> 40:24.789
We can use the headlight
as a parabolic mirror.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.291
And we got
the side view mirrors...

40:27.291 --> 40:28.292
To beam it in.

40:28.292 --> 40:30.294
We could use the lens
from the binoculars

40:30.294 --> 40:31.796
to modify the curvature
of the reflector

40:31.796 --> 40:34.298
to give it
a little more distance.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.801
KATE:
Yeah, but we still
have to get closer.

40:36.801 --> 40:40.304
But we got a plan.
Let's go.

40:47.311 --> 40:48.813
Nest to Eagle.

40:48.813 --> 40:51.315
LARKIN:
This is Eagle. Go ahead, Nest.

40:51.315 --> 40:53.818
I'm indicating
six minutes to launch.

40:53.818 --> 40:54.819
You in sync?

40:54.819 --> 40:57.321
We're all set. Ready to go.

40:57.321 --> 41:00.324
I want the countdown
on the radio to confirm launch.

41:00.324 --> 41:02.827
You got it.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.844
We're going to use
the parabolic mirror

41:19.844 --> 41:22.346
as a solar collector
and focus the sunlight

41:22.346 --> 41:24.849
through the binocular lens
and position over it.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.851
Concentrating it.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.357
Yeah. Now, it comes
off the sun

41:33.357 --> 41:35.359
at about 6,000 degrees
Centigrade.

41:37.361 --> 41:40.865
It'll still be plenty hot
by the time we bounce it.

41:44.869 --> 41:48.873
Can you aim accurately
with a flat mirror?

41:48.873 --> 41:50.875
I'll check it out.

41:54.378 --> 41:56.881
It looks about right.

41:57.882 --> 41:58.883
Just have to position

41:58.883 --> 42:00.384
our collector now.

42:00.384 --> 42:02.386
KATE:
We're getting a beam!

42:08.893 --> 42:11.896
The trick is to heat up
the ejector port...

42:11.896 --> 42:13.397
then the shell inside.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.400
The gun oil's
already smoking.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.404
When that powder gets hot
enough, it's going to blow.

42:20.404 --> 42:22.907
Exactly...

42:22.907 --> 42:24.909
and hopefully take
the gas tank with it.

42:24.909 --> 42:26.410
(sizzling)

42:39.423 --> 42:41.425
(groaning)

42:49.934 --> 42:51.936
All right!

42:51.936 --> 42:53.938
I can't believe
this worked!

42:53.938 --> 42:55.439
Come on, it worked!

42:59.944 --> 43:00.945
KATE:
Are they dead?

43:00.945 --> 43:03.447
No, they're just out
for a while.

43:06.450 --> 43:07.952
That was close.

43:07.952 --> 43:09.954
Another two minutes, this
thing would've been airborne.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.956
HATCHER (over walkie-talkie):
Nest to Eagle.

43:11.956 --> 43:13.457
Why haven't you started
countdown?

43:13.457 --> 43:16.460
Eagle, do you copy?
I don't hear your countdown.

43:16.460 --> 43:17.461
Nest to Eagle,
if you're having

43:17.461 --> 43:18.462
trouble, I'll fly
the second bird.

43:18.963 --> 43:20.464
Over.

43:20.464 --> 43:21.966
Commencing countdown.

43:21.966 --> 43:23.968
Larkin, is that you?

43:23.968 --> 43:26.470
Continuing countdown from 20,

43:26.470 --> 43:29.473
19, 18, 17...

43:29.473 --> 43:30.975
You're not Larkin.

43:30.975 --> 43:32.977
Nice try, whoever you are.

43:32.977 --> 43:33.978
Elevate the missile.

43:33.978 --> 43:35.479
Yes, sir.

43:38.983 --> 43:40.484
Can he fire this thing
by remote control?

43:40.484 --> 43:41.986
No, but he doesn't have to.

43:41.986 --> 43:43.487
He's gonna fire
the other missile.

43:43.487 --> 43:45.489
All right, settle down.
Don't give up yet.

43:45.489 --> 43:48.492
Listen, how well do you know
that guidance system?

43:48.492 --> 43:49.493
Well, to start with,
it overrides

43:49.493 --> 43:50.995
the surface-to-air
configuration.

43:50.995 --> 43:52.997
Uh, so without it, it
becomes a heat seeker?

43:52.997 --> 43:56.000
Yes, exactly. That's the way
it was originally designed.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.001
All we have to do is get it

43:57.001 --> 43:59.003
within a half a mile
of the other target.

43:59.003 --> 44:01.505
Right. I think we
can vector into that
kind of window.

44:01.505 --> 44:03.507
You can, and it will blow 'em
both to smithereens!

44:03.507 --> 44:06.010
Provided we fire it within
seconds of their launch.

44:06.010 --> 44:07.011
Go to work.

44:17.521 --> 44:20.524
(panting)

44:20.524 --> 44:21.525
Come on, Kate.

44:21.525 --> 44:23.027
Gotta move!

44:23.027 --> 44:25.029
If I could just pop
this chip out.

44:28.532 --> 44:33.537
...five, four, three, two, one!

44:34.538 --> 44:37.041
(thrusters roaring)

44:41.545 --> 44:42.546
Got it!
Stand clear.

44:47.051 --> 44:49.053
Come on, Kate.

44:52.556 --> 44:55.559
(thrusters roaring)

45:10.574 --> 45:12.076
KATE:
MacGyver!

45:12.076 --> 45:14.078
We did it!

45:14.078 --> 45:15.079
Yeah.

45:15.079 --> 45:17.081
Yeah. I'd say.

45:29.093 --> 45:33.097
(dance music playing)

45:33.097 --> 45:36.600
(indistinct voices)

45:45.609 --> 45:47.111
Me, too.

45:47.111 --> 45:50.114
Les... listen,
I'll be right back, okay?

45:50.114 --> 45:51.615
Go ahead.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.621
Excuse me.

46:03.627 --> 46:05.129
Hi.

46:05.129 --> 46:06.630
Hi.

46:06.630 --> 46:08.632
I see some changes
have been made.

46:08.632 --> 46:10.134
Yeah, sorta, I guess.

46:10.134 --> 46:11.135
You look great.

46:11.135 --> 46:13.137
Yeah? Thank you.

46:13.137 --> 46:14.638
Listen, I wanted to tell you.

46:14.638 --> 46:16.640
They busted Hatcher
and his friends

46:16.640 --> 46:19.143
and the wacko that was
behind the whole thing.
Good.

46:19.143 --> 46:22.646
Yeah. And the Defense
Department's gonna be clamoring

46:22.646 --> 46:24.648
for your services
right around graduation time.

46:24.648 --> 46:27.651
I got a feeling they're
gonna spring for your own lab.

46:27.651 --> 46:30.154
Oh, that's pretty all
right, that's good.

46:37.161 --> 46:39.163
So, why don't you introduce him?

46:39.163 --> 46:42.666
He's shy, especially
around strangers.

46:42.666 --> 46:44.668
But get him
alone in a lab...

46:44.668 --> 46:46.170
can he compute!
Figures.

46:46.170 --> 46:48.172
(laughs)

46:49.173 --> 46:50.674
Thanks for everything.

46:50.674 --> 46:52.676
You bet.

46:52.676 --> 46:55.679
(giggles):
Well...

46:55.679 --> 46:57.681
will I see you again?

46:57.681 --> 47:00.184
You can count on it.

47:00.184 --> 47:01.185
I will.

47:01.185 --> 47:02.686
Okay.

47:06.690 --> 47:08.192
DANCER:
Whoo!

47:08.192 --> 47:10.194
(indistinct voices)

47:10.194 --> 47:12.196
Come on, Les.
Let's dance.

47:13.697 --> 47:16.200
DANCER:
All right!

47:18.702 --> 47:20.704
Your dancing is great.

47:23.707 --> 47:26.210
? ?

47:36.720 --> 47:40.724
