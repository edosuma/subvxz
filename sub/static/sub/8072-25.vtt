WEBVTT

00:08.309 --> 00:09.610
I don't know, Rosesanne.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.779
This bank book is
like her business.

00:11.812 --> 00:16.184
I just feel dirty invading
Darlene's privacy like this.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.152
Jackie, when
you're her mother,

00:18.186 --> 00:20.388
it is not called
"invading privacy."

00:20.421 --> 00:22.190
It's just called "cleaning."

00:25.025 --> 00:26.827
Whoa, lookie here!

00:26.860 --> 00:30.831
Why, I haven't cleaned
this lockbox in years.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.666
Do you happen to have
a screwdriver on you?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.868
You know, it's possible she's
given up on the whole writing

00:34.902 --> 00:35.969
school idea.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.505
Just because she got
a job at the Buy & Bag

00:37.538 --> 00:41.675
doesn't mean she's saving up
money to run away from home.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.177
Roseanne?

00:43.211 --> 00:45.579
What, did you
find her bank book?

00:45.613 --> 00:48.249
"Dear mom, I am
leaving home forever.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.683
I do not love you anymore.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.918
Goodbye, Darlene."

00:50.951 --> 00:54.054
Oh, she might already be gone.

00:54.088 --> 00:59.293
"PS, I am taking Huggy
Bear and Foofoo the Bunny."

00:59.327 --> 01:00.828
No, this is from
the third grade.

01:00.861 --> 01:04.498
Foofoo was killed in a laundry
accident eight years ago.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.666
Well, it's more
than you found.

01:05.699 --> 01:06.867
I'll put it back.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.102
No, no, no.

01:08.136 --> 01:12.173
I wanna put it in the album
with all her other ones.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.342
You don't need the
letter opener, Roseanne.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.476
The key's taped to the bottom.

01:20.548 --> 01:25.386
Well, I can use it
to ply the key off.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.088
Whatever you find in there,
don't get mad at Darling.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.023
Because you two have been
sniping so much at each other

01:30.057 --> 01:30.858
lately.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.129
Oh, man, is she
in terrible now.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.029
Look at this.

01:36.063 --> 01:39.367
Cigarettes, condoms.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.302
And here's her bank book.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.403
Let at that.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.904
There's even a hair
on it, so she can tell

01:43.937 --> 01:46.006
if somebody tampered with it.

01:46.039 --> 01:49.443
I wonder why she has so much
trouble trusting people?

01:49.477 --> 01:53.981
She was up to 325 bucks and
she took out 300 yesterday.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.048
Well, that's it, Jackie.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.385
That's her gas and
motel money right there.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.187
You OK?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.121
Yeah.

02:01.155 --> 02:04.458
OK, let's just put the
room back like we find it.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.359
It'll be all right.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.260
I'm here to help.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.094
You know that.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.701
Ow!

02:13.734 --> 02:16.136
[theme music]

03:05.619 --> 03:07.855
So then we moved to Florida,
and it was kind of hot there,

03:07.888 --> 03:08.756
you know.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.624
And-- and we had this house.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.093
And then we moved
to San Francisco.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.296
You know, it rained a lot.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.931
You know, and we had this house,
like-- like, on this hill.

03:17.965 --> 03:22.002
So then we moved to Detroit?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.337
No, wait. wasn't Detroit.
Let me see.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.538
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.006
Let me see.
Wait.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.075
Detroit!
Let's just say Detroit!

03:32.980 --> 03:34.882
Hey.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.618
Dad, you gotta go
home now, George.

03:37.651 --> 03:42.055
My dad gets really mad
when I have friends over.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.825
He's very strict.
Aren't you, dad?

03:44.858 --> 03:45.893
Yes, it's true, son.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.796
You're in for a whooping.

03:48.829 --> 03:49.697
Oh.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.998
OK, I'll leave now.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.034
And DJ, don't forget to
come to my party on Friday--

03:54.067 --> 03:55.536
on Saturday night.
Yeah, Saturday.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.370
Saturday.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.440
Nice kid.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.309
Why do you hate him?

04:01.342 --> 04:04.612
He's new, and he's geeky,
and he's weird-looking.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.213
So were you, but your
mother made us bring you

04:06.246 --> 04:08.649
home from the hospital anyway.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.984
I can't believe
Darlene smokes.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.387
Oh, I think she just stole
these from me, you know,

04:13.421 --> 04:15.556
back when I was smoking.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.224
Anything else
you want me to do?

04:17.257 --> 04:21.228
No, just go home and wait
for my hysterical phone call.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.830
Roseanne?

04:22.863 --> 04:23.731
Oh, Rosie.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.732
There you are.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.133
I've been under
Darlene's car all day,

04:26.166 --> 04:28.068
and I can't find
what's wrong with it.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.204
It's missing a squiggly thing.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.374
And this diagnosis
is based on?

04:33.407 --> 04:34.708
-

04:34.742 --> 04:36.276
The fact that the thing I
pulled out of there last night

04:36.310 --> 04:38.346
was squiggly!

04:38.379 --> 04:39.547
Oh, God, Roseanne.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.414
What's next?

04:40.448 --> 04:41.582
You're gonna hobble her?

04:41.615 --> 04:42.983
She's out of here, Dan.

04:43.016 --> 04:46.854
She withdrew all $300 from her
bank account, and she's gone.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.188
You don't know what
that money is for.

04:48.221 --> 04:52.993
She could be using
to buy bullets.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.495
Where have you been?

04:54.528 --> 04:55.463
Paris.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.532
Oh, I mean the mall.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.634
Look at what
Darlene bought me.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.669
Oh, look, honey.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.437
It's a CD player.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.906
Say Darlene, what does one
of these things go for now?

05:05.939 --> 05:08.308
50, 60?

05:08.342 --> 05:09.577
299 bucks?

05:09.610 --> 05:10.978
Something like that.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.312
Look, honey.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.516
Our daughter spent all her
cash on a CD player, a present

05:15.549 --> 05:16.717
for her boyfriend.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.086
Now, what have you got
to say to that, Roseanne?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.588
Hey, how do you know
how much cash I have?

05:24.358 --> 05:25.993
You looked in my bank book.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.562
Hey, I have every right
to look in that bank book.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.664
Your father and I started you
a college account when you

05:30.698 --> 05:32.733
were born, and I
just wanted to see

05:32.766 --> 05:35.936
if that $20 was still in there.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.171
It's pretty pathetic that
you've got nothing better to do

05:38.205 --> 05:39.306
than to snoop around my room.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.207
Hello, David.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.108
You're looking well today.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.043
And is that a new hairdo?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.077
Thank you, Mr. Connor.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.880
I asked him to do
it just like yours.

05:46.914 --> 05:50.518
See how easy it is for
men folk to get along?

05:50.551 --> 05:52.119
Yeah, you're a
real inspiration.

05:52.152 --> 05:52.953
David, come.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.428
I'm gonna go make dinner.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.462
Now, look, Roseanne.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.798
Don't you see what
just happened here?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.266
She's not going.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.336
She's blown all her
money on teenage crap.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.439
She's not planning for
her future at all, honey.

06:11.472 --> 06:15.342
It's everything we prayed for.
- Move!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.645
You're acting like
a crazed psychopath.

06:17.678 --> 06:21.048
Well, the voices
in my head disagree.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.716
If you don't stop
coming down on this kid,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.918
you're gonna drive her
right out of the house.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.319
Now, I'm willing
to share the blame

06:26.353 --> 06:28.856
on what happened to Becky, but
you're flying solo on this one.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.394
Well, all right.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.830
I guess maybe
because I'm so tired,

06:36.864 --> 06:39.366
I might be willing
to admit that there's

06:39.399 --> 06:41.869
a slight chance I was wrong.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.170
Thank you, Roseanne.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.938
I know how hard it is for
you to admit you were tired.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.275
Darlene.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.316
I kind of want to apologize
to you for the way

06:56.349 --> 06:58.786
I've been treating you.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.687
You're kidding.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.321
You're apologizing to me?

07:01.354 --> 07:02.490
Well, not for your whole life!

07:02.523 --> 07:05.759
Just for the past
couple of weeks.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.260
Well, it wasn't
all your fault.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.129
I'd like to think that I
was pretty mean to you too.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.134
So I guess we
actually approach

07:14.167 --> 07:17.771
the end of Bitchfest '93.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.139
Oh, what a time we had.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.549
See?

07:28.582 --> 07:30.117
Now that you've said you're
sorry, don't you feel better?

07:30.150 --> 07:32.352
No, don't feel better at all.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.420
Come on.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.988
Don't you just feel
a little bit better?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.491
No, I don't feel
better at all!

07:37.525 --> 07:39.292
Well, you should!

07:39.326 --> 07:40.628
Well, I'll tell you what, Dan.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.930
From now on, I won't feel
anything that I'm feeling, OK?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.965
I'll just wait for you
to tell me what feelings

07:44.998 --> 07:46.266
you feel I should be feeling!

07:48.969 --> 07:49.770
Feel this.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.415
Stop, stop.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.984
There's no need for begging.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.919
I'm ready to tell you all
about my day at the garage.

08:05.953 --> 08:06.820
Hey.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.789
Look, I even took pictures.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.791
This is my desk.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.194
This is my pencil cup empty.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.730
There it is filled with pencils.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.567
And look, a chair.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.736
A job where you
get to sit all day.

08:22.770 --> 08:23.604
Now, that's class.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.681
Well, they had a
special on garbage.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.716
What can I say?

08:35.749 --> 08:36.784
What, no orange peels?

08:36.817 --> 08:39.086
They were on the list.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.120
I was driving around.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.722
The grocery list was
in the front seat.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.490
You do the math.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.326
You went to Buy & Bag, you saw
Darlene, and the two of you lit

08:46.359 --> 08:49.096
the torch for Bitchfest '94.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.131
No, we got along fine.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.968
I just stood there and
watched her bag groceries.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.371
Then how do you explain
this gutted potato chip bag?

08:58.405 --> 08:59.973
Well, I kind of
needed that to help

09:00.007 --> 09:02.309
me figure out that how
come I've been being

09:02.342 --> 09:04.144
so mean to Darlene lately.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.213
I think I'm screwing
up her life.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.414
Well, you have to, honey.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.550
I can't do it by myself.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.352
She's vegetating here, Dan.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.454
She hasn't even worked on her
comic for two weeks, you know.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.256
And that used to be so
important to her for.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.658
Well, she got tired
of doing her comic.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.060
Now she's doing something else.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.029
Two weeks ago, she was
dreaming of being a writer,

09:22.062 --> 09:23.330
you know?

09:23.363 --> 09:26.199
Now her big dream's being
a cashier at the Buy & Bag.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.168
What are you trying to say?

09:28.201 --> 09:29.837
I think we should let
her go to that school.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.605
Aw, come on.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.673
No, I'm serious.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.908
We couldn't give
Becky a future, right?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.777
So Darlene goes
out and gets one,

09:36.810 --> 09:39.179
and now why are we trying
to take it away from her?

09:39.212 --> 09:40.781
We ain't trying to take
nothing away from her.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.250
She can wait till she's
18 to have a future.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.151
Hell, I'm 40.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.919
I just found mine.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.655
Well, that's my
whole point, Dan.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.856
See?

09:48.889 --> 09:51.258
I mean, I'm standing there
watching her doing lousy

09:51.291 --> 09:53.694
at a crappy job,
you know, and being

09:53.727 --> 09:55.428
rude to all the customers.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.131
It just reminded
me so much of me.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.434
10 years, I don't want her
to end up where I'm at.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.335
Where?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.170
Where are you?

10:05.973 --> 10:09.442
No place special, Stuck
in Lanford, Illinois,

10:09.476 --> 10:14.982
kind of wondering about maybe
I could have done some stuff.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.018
What kind of stuff?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.586
I don't know, like--

10:19.619 --> 10:21.822
well, what if I would
have went to college?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.224
Or if what if I didn't
have kids so young?

10:24.257 --> 10:27.695
What if you hadn't
gotten married?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.329
Well, yeah.
Maybe.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.263
I don't know.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.631
Do you ever think
about that, Dan?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.366
No, I always thought it was
the smartest thing I ever did.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.868
You obviously don't agree.

10:34.902 --> 10:35.936
No, I do agree with you.

10:35.969 --> 10:36.870
It was the smartest
thing you ever did,

10:36.904 --> 10:37.838
but we're talking about me now!

10:44.511 --> 10:46.046
I never told you you
had to stay in Lanford.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.647
That was a choice you made.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.483
I am not blaming you, Dan.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.986
I chose this life,
and I love it,

10:53.020 --> 10:55.856
except for that no
dishwasher thing.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.624
But you know, I'm
just starting to think

10:57.657 --> 11:00.027
about some stuff I gave up.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.494
Everybody gives up stuff.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.296
Hell, I gave up a lot of stuff!

11:03.330 --> 11:05.332
Like what?

11:05.365 --> 11:08.501
Like being single.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.237
I wanted to write
children's books, Dan.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.604
Remember?

11:11.638 --> 11:13.473
Honey, I built you a whole
writing room in the basement,

11:13.506 --> 11:14.775
but you never used it.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.343
There was nothing stopping
you from finishing

11:16.376 --> 11:18.111
the Adventures of
Mancini the Elephant

11:18.145 --> 11:20.714
or Peepee the Talking Mouse.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.182
His name is Pippet, Dan!

11:25.585 --> 11:28.956
And I never had time, what
with the bike shop, and Becky,

11:28.989 --> 11:29.857
and being broke all the--

11:29.890 --> 11:31.691
So it's my fault again.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.026
- Hey.
- Beat it.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.094
Mommy's fighting.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.128
No, we're not fighting.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.930
Fight's over with.
Darlene, come here.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.231
I want you to sit
down for a minute.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.566
Dan, we haven't
finished talking yet.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.700
Roseanne, I don't
want two women

11:40.734 --> 11:42.602
thinking I ruined their lives!

11:42.635 --> 11:45.739
Now, I wanna do this right.

11:45.773 --> 11:50.944
Darlene, your mom and
I have been talking,

11:50.978 --> 11:54.014
and we're not sure,
but maybe we think

11:54.047 --> 11:55.916
you ought to go to school.

11:55.949 --> 11:56.884
I do go to school.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.118
It's just sometimes
I'm directing

11:58.151 --> 11:59.887
a lost freshman to his
class and I miss roll call.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.025
You don't wanna
mess this up, Darlene.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.127
Your dad and I are willing
to talk about this Chicago

12:07.160 --> 12:07.961
school thing again.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.100
What do you mean,
talk about it?

12:13.133 --> 12:15.335
Talking, it's like
yelling, only not as loud.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.908
Well, thanks, but
I changed my mind.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.844
I'm not going.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.879
Can she do that?

12:25.913 --> 12:30.784
Hey, you're staying here
because of David, aren't you?

12:30.818 --> 12:32.452
No.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.155
You know, planning your whole
future around some boyfriend

12:35.188 --> 12:36.824
is not really a great idea.

12:36.857 --> 12:37.858
I'm not.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.426
I just decided it
wasn't right for me.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.794
Isn't that possible?

12:40.828 --> 12:41.728
No!

12:41.761 --> 12:42.830
Look, you didn't
want me to go.

12:42.863 --> 12:43.730
I'm not going.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.664
Congratulations.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.498
You win.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.671
Staying here against
her will is one thing,

12:51.704 --> 12:54.007
but staying here
because she wants to?

12:54.041 --> 12:54.842
That's sick.

13:03.050 --> 13:06.186
This is a 1967 penny.

13:06.219 --> 13:10.057
And this is a 1968.

13:10.090 --> 13:15.829
And I don't have a
'69, but here's a '70.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.531
And then if you notice the
little letter under the date,

13:18.565 --> 13:21.468
this indicates which city
the penny was made in.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.504
You see, like, D,
that's for Denver.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.573
And S is for San Francisco.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.474
Here, wanna see?

13:27.507 --> 13:28.308
We believe you.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.245
I don't have quite
as many nickels,

13:32.279 --> 13:33.146
but I do have this one.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.581
It's a 1975.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.149
See what I mean?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.084
And the 1974s are--

13:37.117 --> 13:38.651
You know, George,
we really wish

13:38.685 --> 13:40.720
you could stay a
lot longer, but DJ

13:40.753 --> 13:44.757
and I need to practice
our religion now.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.159
Oh.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.028
Oh, OK.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.362
I'll go now.

13:49.396 --> 13:53.166
And DJ, don't forget to come
to my party on Friday night.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.268
See you.

13:55.302 --> 13:58.105
I'm not going.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.206
No.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.573
Aw, come on, Deej.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.542
You're missing a
great opportunity.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.611
Odds are, you'll be the most
interesting person there.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.417
OK, I'll go.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.752
All right, atta boy.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.621
Now go wrap up one of
your toys as a present.

14:19.726 --> 14:20.593
Oh, hey.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.694
There you are.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.897
I wanna talk to you for a sec.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.665
Sure, what's up?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.435
Well, now we know that
you and Darlene are,

14:28.468 --> 14:30.303
you know, in love with
each other and everything.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.739
But lately me and
Mr. Connor have

14:32.772 --> 14:35.308
been really concerned
about what's going

14:35.342 --> 14:37.810
on between the two of you.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.379
Really?

14:39.412 --> 14:40.713
You are?

14:40.747 --> 14:41.614
Relax, David.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.251
I'm not talking about sex.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.152
I know.

14:45.185 --> 14:45.986
Come on.

14:48.688 --> 14:52.926
Lucky for you, I'm still
in denial about that.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.794
Thank you.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.597
Me and Mr. Connor,
we want Darlene

14:57.630 --> 15:00.600
to go to that art school.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.501
You're kidding?

15:01.534 --> 15:03.403
You just changed your minds?

15:03.436 --> 15:05.172
Yeah.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.674
And you know, she's acting
like she doesn't wanna go,

15:07.707 --> 15:10.377
although I know that she
really does wanna go,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.579
and I think that she's
doing that because she

15:12.612 --> 15:15.682
wants to stay here with you.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.684
Yeah?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.419
So I was thinking
that maybe you

15:19.452 --> 15:21.254
and I could get
together and figure

15:21.288 --> 15:24.257
out some way to make her go.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.360
But I don't want her to go.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.729
Well, nobody wants
her to go, David.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.633
I mean, except for maybe DJ
and the-- and the school board.

15:33.666 --> 15:38.571
But we all know
that she should go.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.906
Well, I don't
think she should go.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.742
We're happy here.
We're a couple.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.544
Yeah, but you know
what they say, David.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.415
They say "when you
really love something,

15:48.448 --> 15:50.617
you should, you
know, make it go away

15:50.650 --> 15:52.152
or get rid of it or whatever."

15:54.988 --> 15:56.856
I'm sorry, Mrs.
Connor, but Darlene and I

15:56.889 --> 15:58.025
have already talked about this.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.160
And I told her if
she goes to Chicago,

16:00.193 --> 16:03.096
I'm breaking up with her.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.332
You what?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.733
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

16:06.766 --> 16:08.101
I'm gonna go up
there and make sure she

16:08.135 --> 16:10.603
does what's right for Darlene,
David, and not for you.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.039
You can't tell
Darlene what to do.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.873
She's a big girl.
- Compared to who?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.380
David, go back downstairs.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.415
DAVID: Why are you
trying to break us up?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.351
David, right now the
only thing I wanna see

16:24.384 --> 16:26.419
is the back of your head
getting smaller, and smaller,

16:26.453 --> 16:27.554
and smaller.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.190
There are several ways
we can accomplish this.

16:32.859 --> 16:33.893
Oh, that's so sweet.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.228
You two are having
your first fight,

16:35.262 --> 16:39.032
and you rushed all the
way up here to show me.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.268
You know, I just don't get
it, Darlene, doing things

16:41.301 --> 16:43.170
because a guy says so, huh?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.072
Who raised you?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.639
Well, she's doing
what she wants to do.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.975
Why can't you just
stay out of this?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.810
David, I would
hate to embarrass you

16:50.843 --> 16:52.745
in front of your
girlfriend by throwing

16:52.779 --> 16:54.981
you out of here physically--

16:55.014 --> 16:55.815
ah, what the hell.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.689
DAVID: Thanks for
not embarrassing me.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.224
Mom, this is not a big deal.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.394
David and I are just gonna
apply again next year.

17:07.427 --> 17:11.498
Well, what if you apply every
year and he never gets in?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.133
Why can't you just drop this?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.934
Because it's too weird!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.469
Ever since you could
talk, you've been whining

17:16.503 --> 17:17.737
about getting out of Lanford.
And what?

17:17.770 --> 17:18.871
Now you got a
boyfriend, so you're

17:18.905 --> 17:20.240
gonna go change your mind?

17:20.273 --> 17:22.375
I thought you wanted
something better than this.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.010
- Better than what?
- Better than this!

17:24.043 --> 17:24.911
Better than this room.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.946
Better than this whole house!

17:26.979 --> 17:29.449
Better than this pillow.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.218
Better than this quilt, OK?

17:31.251 --> 17:33.853
Better than this trash can!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.622
Mom, cut it out.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.056
I mean, what if I go
there, and everybody

17:37.090 --> 17:39.025
else is, like, way brilliant,
and I find out I suck?

17:39.058 --> 17:39.859
Then what happens?

17:43.863 --> 17:46.366
So you mean this whole
thing is not even about David?

17:49.802 --> 17:52.605
So you gotta tell me, Darlene,
which of the motherly speeches

17:52.639 --> 17:53.673
am I supposed to be giving here.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.143
Because I'm totally off track!

17:56.176 --> 17:59.212
Well, we're through talking.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.182
Yeah, we are.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.850
What are you doing?

18:03.883 --> 18:05.652
I figure if I wash him
'em all in hot water,

18:05.685 --> 18:08.555
I can fit 'em in one suitcase.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.591
Mom, why can't I just live
at home, like a normal kid?

18:11.624 --> 18:14.627
Because, as I have told you
for your entire life, Darlene,

18:14.661 --> 18:15.728
you are not normal!

18:18.365 --> 18:19.266
OK?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.800
You dress funny.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.068
You're weird.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.404
You're too smart for
your own damn good.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.738
Let's face it, Darlene.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.474
You're special, and I think
you can be something great.

18:31.478 --> 18:35.382
Well, I, tried
to leave last week.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.549
I packed my bags.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.118
I got in my car.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.388
I couldn't do it.

18:41.421 --> 18:45.192
You cannot be
afraid of failure, OK?

18:45.225 --> 18:46.859
So what, you get there,
you find out you suck?

18:46.893 --> 18:48.127
Great!

18:48.161 --> 18:50.863
You're gonna be the first
Connor to suck in college.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.465
You can come back home.

18:52.499 --> 18:56.135
We ain't going nowhere,
never have for 20 years!

18:56.169 --> 18:57.937
Yeah, but it was different
when David was going.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.540
I just don't think I
can do it by myself.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.442
Listen to me, little girl.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.043
I'm gonna tell you something.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.447
Sometimes, life just
gives you one chance.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.182
And if you do not grab it--

19:09.216 --> 19:10.082
when?

19:10.116 --> 19:11.451
When were you in the car?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.953
I've been watching
you like a hawk.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.988
Well, hawks don't generally
pass out on the couch

19:16.022 --> 19:17.156
after eating a
quart of ice cream.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.798
Well, let me put
it to you this way.

19:28.968 --> 19:33.473
You gotta go, because
I want you to go.

19:33.506 --> 19:37.109
Because if you don't go,
you're gonna regret it.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.512
Maybe not now, OK?

19:39.546 --> 19:41.047
But soon.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.181
And then for the
rest of your life.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.054
I love you, Darlene,
and I want you

19:48.087 --> 19:49.556
to get the hell out of here.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.197
I can't believe
you're letting me go.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.098
I can't either.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.473
So now you've gotta go down
there and talk to David.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.675
Unless, of course,
you want me to.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.509
I'm going.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.265
I'm home!

20:32.299 --> 20:33.366
Hey, Deej.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.901
Come here and tell us
all about the party.

20:34.934 --> 20:35.935
Thanks for making me go.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.169
It was great.
- Yeah?

20:37.203 --> 20:38.371
Come here and sit down.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.172
Tell us about all the kind
of games and fun things

20:40.206 --> 20:41.374
you guys did.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.309
I touched a boob.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.754
Say what?

20:54.787 --> 20:58.491
We played this game,
7 Minutes in Heaven.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.193
And I had to go in the
closet with Sheila Frye.

21:01.227 --> 21:05.965
And we just stood there doing
nothing for, like, six minutes.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.301
What happened in
that last minute, son?

21:08.335 --> 21:09.402
I told you.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.472
I'd touched a boob.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.073
She's my girlfriend now.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.743
She's coming over for
dinner tomorrow night.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.577
She likes corn.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.121
Woo doggie.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.491
We're gonna have to have
a long talk with that boy.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.530
