22:29.381 --> 22:31.247
<i>Dave: Three minutes in,

22:31.316 --> 22:33.512
<i>Kim: Dan, Casey,
to the studio, please.</i>

22:33.585 --> 22:36.452
<i>Dan: I tell you to hit. What do you do?
Are you listening to me?</i>

22:36.521 --> 22:38.512
You know, I don't understand
the insurance.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.615
You don't have to understand
the insurance.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.490
-- I just buy the insurance.
-- Yes, you do.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.859
When did you become the guy who
knows more than me about blackjack?

22:44.930 --> 22:47.194
I've always been the guy who knew
more than you about blackjack.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.859
-- Always?
-- Yes.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.096
-- Then why do you lose?
-- I never lose.

22:51.169 --> 22:52.068
You always lose.

22:52.137 --> 22:53.127
I hardly ever lose.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.263
You hardly ever win.

22:54.339 --> 22:55.329
Tonight's different.

22:55.407 --> 22:56.533
Yeah, I had a hunch.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.667
-- <i>I'm in the</i> zone.
-- <i>There's no zone.</i>

22:58.744 --> 23:00.508
-- <i>There's</i> a zone.
-- <i>There really isn't.</i>

23:00.579 --> 23:03.640
There is a very palpable
zone, my friend,

23:03.715 --> 23:04.807
and I am in it.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.942
<i>Dave: Two minutes in,
three minutes live.</i>

23:07.019 --> 23:10.387
Jeremy, check Natalie's shot sheet
in the 20s. She got something wrong.

23:10.455 --> 23:12.048
You got something wrong?

23:12.124 --> 23:15.094
Yes, I did, wonder boy, and after
the show, I'm gonna kill myself.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.458
Why don't you go play
some tennis with your friends?

23:17.529 --> 23:19.520
How many times do you want me
to say, "I'm sorry"?

23:19.598 --> 23:21.362
It's gonna be
a few more times.

23:21.433 --> 23:22.798
We're having a little thing.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.734
I've been hearing about it
all day.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.032
Teddy, it's a standing two.

23:26.104 --> 23:28.334
Ask them about their running game.
Ask them about injuries.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.841
She wanted to go
to the movies.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.808
<i>I really</i> have been hearing
about it all day.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.073
Dana,
can I see you out here?

23:34.146 --> 23:35.204
Yeah.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.816
What's going on?

23:38.884 --> 23:40.682
I'm shrinking.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.289
-- But that's not what I came to tell you.
-- You're shrinking?

23:44.356 --> 23:47.417
Manny measured me for a new suit an
hour ago. Turns out I'm shrinking.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.586
Where?

23:49.661 --> 23:52.426
-- You want to listen to me, or you want
to tell yourfunnyjokes? -- I can do both.

23:52.497 --> 23:54.591
Heh. Peter Lasker
and Paul Schapp are --

23:54.666 --> 23:56.828
-- Oh, you're kidding.
-- It's snowing in Pittsburgh.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.496
-- Dan and Casey are going to
Atlantic City. -- Not tonight.

23:59.571 --> 24:00.834
Paul and Peter
are stuck at the airport?

24:00.906 --> 24:02.431
They've been sitting
on the tarmac.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.100
Casey and Dan are gonna be
pretty mad, Isaac.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.541
You better get in there
and tell them.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.237
I've decided to let you do it.

24:07.312 --> 24:08.404
Really?

24:08.480 --> 24:11.177
-- I'm delegating.
-- Thank you.

24:11.249 --> 24:13.877
Don't mention it.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.750
Paul and Peter are on
a tarmac in Pittsburgh.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.755
<i>60 seconds to VTR.</i>

-- Stand by, VTR.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.623
-- Paul and Peter aren't gonna make it?
-- It's snowing.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.457
The guys think they're going
to Atlantic City.

24:23.528 --> 24:25.895
-- Not tonight.
-- Who's gonna tell them?

24:27.899 --> 24:29.389
<i>ROH VTR.</i>

24:29.468 --> 24:31.402
-- I say, “Double down.“ What do you do?
-- Can we stop?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.802
-- I say, “Double down.“ What do you do?
-- How do you know you're in the zone?

24:33.872 --> 24:35.738
Cut me.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.241
-- Danny, I --
-- Cut the cards.

-- Double my ass down.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.258
Fellas,
I've got some bad news.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.233
There's no bad news tonight,
Natalie.

25:03.301 --> 25:04.393
When the show comes down,

25:04.469 --> 25:05.698
Danny and I
are hopping in a limo,

25:05.771 --> 25:07.136
heading down
the Garden State Parkway,

25:07.205 --> 25:09.606
and getting off at the exit
clearly marked "The Zone."

25:09.674 --> 25:11.608
That's great, Casey, but all
those things you just said --

25:11.676 --> 25:12.905
-- Yeah?
-- not gonna happen.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.072
Show her the card thing.

25:15.147 --> 25:18.117
Paul and Peter
are trapped in an airport.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.845
It's snowing in Pittsburgh. You gotta
stay and do the “VVest Coast Update.“

25:20.919 --> 25:22.944
Look, I know you guys had your heart
set on going to Atlantic City

25:23.021 --> 25:24.455
and that this isn't the first
time that this has happened --

25:24.523 --> 25:25.888
-- Natalie...
-- Yeah?

25:25.924 --> 25:27.050
It's no problem.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.991
-- It's no problem?
-- <i>It's no</i> problem.

-- <i>l/Ve all work for the same network.</i>
-- <i>We're</i> happy <i>to help out.</i>

25:37.002 --> 25:38.436
I have to say
I'm really impressed

25:38.503 --> 25:40.301
with the maturity you two are
exhibiting right now.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.342
-- Part of the job.
-- Have a good show.

25:47.345 --> 25:48.642
Bites!

25:48.713 --> 25:50.203

Oh, this bites.

<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

25:54.052 --> 25:55.383
Good evening.

25:55.454 --> 25:58.617
From New York City, I'm Dan
Rydell alongside Casey McCall.

25:58.690 --> 26:02.388
Those stories, plus a Ryder Cup preview
and a trip to the Big Sombrero.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.362
We'll run down how the top draft
picks are faring in the big time,

26:05.430 --> 26:08.161
and we'll run up the flag
at Greensboro.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.826
All that
coming up after this.

26:09.901 --> 26:14.338
You're watching "Sports Night"
on CSC, so stick around.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.805
<i>We're out.</i>

26:18.076 --> 26:19.407
Anyway, I-| really appreciate

26:19.478 --> 26:21.674
the two of you sticking around
and filling in.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.339
-- It's no problem.
-- Oh, please.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.541
You think I want to be stuck
doing "The 2:00 A.M."?

26:24.616 --> 26:26.846
-- This is just a temp gig.
-- Temp gig?

26:26.918 --> 26:29.216
-- A temporary gig.
-- Thanks.

26:29.287 --> 26:30.982
My stuffs out there.
I talk to a lot of people.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.683
Just so long as none of them
are talking back.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.555
CNBC, MSNBC...

26:34.626 --> 26:36.151
-- M-O-U-S-E.
-- Danny...

26:36.228 --> 26:37.821
Well, like she's listening
to anybody but herself.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.159
-- Even CNN.
-- No kidding.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.494
Oh, yeah.

26:40.565 --> 26:41.498
Listen, Sally, we're sort of

26:41.566 --> 26:42.499
in the middle of a --

26:42.567 --> 26:43.534
what do you call it? --

26:43.602 --> 26:44.535
a national television show.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.072
But we do good work
on "The 2:00 A.M."

26:47.139 --> 26:49.164
<i>Sally, we're back in 30,
and you're in our shot.</i>

26:49.241 --> 26:51.733
-- I <i>have</i> a keen <i>dislike for that woman.</i>
-- <i>She's perfectly nice.</i>

26:51.810 --> 26:53.073
She is not perfectly nice,

26:53.145 --> 26:55.204
and I'd appreciate
a little backup here.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.714
Can we have a bond
over this, please?

26:56.781 --> 26:58.249
Fine. I'll stop thinking
Sally is nice

26:58.316 --> 26:59.841
if you'll stop thinking
Jeremy is right.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.181
I never said he was right.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.881
-- Hey, I'm sitting right here.
-- Stay quiet! -- Thank you!

27:03.955 --> 27:06.515
Sally, camera 2 has got
your butt pretty well framed,

27:06.591 --> 27:08.582
so if you wouldn't mind
stepping out of the shot...

27:10.128 --> 27:15.191
Thank you. And be sure Casey sees
your cleavage as you walk out.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.167
<i>There you go.</i>

27:17.235 --> 27:19.567
In 3...2...

27:19.638 --> 27:21.936
That's all for us,
but don't shed a tear

27:22.007 --> 27:25.341
'cause Casey and I will be back at 2:00 AJVI.
on this coast, 11:00 P.M. on the left,

27:25.443 --> 27:28.208
subbing in for Peter Lasker and Paul
Sohapp on the “VVest Coast Update.“

27:28.246 --> 27:30.544
So don't adjust that dial,

27:30.615 --> 27:32.982
and while we're gone,
if any talking animals

27:33.051 --> 27:34.917
ask you to buy
some tacos or beer,

27:34.986 --> 27:37.114
for God's sake,
do what they tell you.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.853
-- You've been watching “Sports Night“ on
CSC. Have a good night. -- Good night, Mom.

27:40.926 --> 27:41.859
We're out.

27:41.927 --> 27:45.295
[Clears throat]
You know, it occurs to me

27:45.363 --> 27:48.526
-- we have some time to kill.
-- Yes.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.298
-- And a deck of cards.
-- Yes!

27:52.370 --> 27:53.531
We've been to the A.T.M.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.199
Some people around here with a little
too much change in their pockets.

27:56.274 --> 27:58.606
-- We gotta lighten these folks up a
little bit. -- Take 'em off their 00in.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.145
You know what they say.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.509
-- About what?
-- About money won.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.571
-- What do they say? -- I don't know.
I'm asking.

28:03.648 --> 28:05.582
They say it's twice as sweet
as money earned.

28:05.650 --> 28:07.641
How come you said,
"What do they say?"

28:07.719 --> 28:10.347
It was an alley-oop pass.
I was dishing you the ball.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.390
You were.
And I completely missed it.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.255
Well, I was there
for the putback.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.260
I wouldn't have been able
to do anything with it anyway.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.387
-- That's right. -- 'Cause I
didn't know the expression.

28:18.463 --> 28:19.988
Not only that, but it was,
like, half an hour ago,

28:20.065 --> 28:21.157
and we're still talking
about it.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.394
<i>Uh-Oh.</i>

28:23.468 --> 28:25.300
You're not in the zone
anymore, are you?

28:25.370 --> 28:28.567
-- <i>Not in the</i> zone.
-- <i>Lost the zone.</i>

28:28.640 --> 28:30.335
I'm down here
with the rest of you.

28:30.408 --> 28:32.342
Let's play cards.
Come on!

28:34.246 --> 28:35.736
Hey, Isaac, you in here?

28:36.548 --> 28:38.983
Whoa! I can barely see you
down there.

28:39.050 --> 28:42.179
Pretty funny coming from someone
I can fire any time I like.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.245
I downloaded some stuff
on osteoporosis.

28:44.322 --> 28:46.154
-- Dana, this is no joke.
-- I know.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.885
And the good news is
it says here

28:47.959 --> 28:50.860
that osteoporosis isn't an inevitable
part of aging as once was thought.

28:50.929 --> 28:53.364
In fact, if you haven't reached
menopause yet -- [ Gasps]

28:53.431 --> 28:55.695
-- No, wait. Hold on.
-- Thank you very much.

28:55.767 --> 28:58.134
Either of you interested in
participating in the sport of kings?

28:58.203 --> 29:00.365
-- <i>We're</i> gonna race <i>horses?</i>
-- <i>We're gonna play poker.</i>

29:00.438 --> 29:02.702
-- That's not the sport of kings.
-- What's the sport of <i>kings?</i>

29:02.774 --> 29:04.708
-- Racing <i>horses.</i>
-- <i>What's poker the sport of?</i>

29:04.776 --> 29:06.301
It's the sport
of people who play poker.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.437
-- Thank <i>you.</i>
-- <i>Isaac's shrinking.</i>

29:08.513 --> 29:12.973
Oh, yeah, Dana, I forgot to ask you
-- please, spread that around.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.541
What do you say? We got
nothing to do for two hours.

29:14.619 --> 29:15.984
$10 minimum, 3-raise limit?

29:16.054 --> 29:18.352
-- Whatever.
-- Shoe money tonight!

29:19.424 --> 29:22.155
-- <i>Whatever.</i> Isaac?
-- <i>I'll play</i> a <i>couple hands.</i>

29:22.227 --> 29:25.458
Isaac, I'm gonna bring along this material
on shrinking and read it aloud as we play

29:25.563 --> 29:27.258
unless you think
that's gonna distract you.

29:27.299 --> 29:29.267
No, I just want to make sure
you've got time

29:29.334 --> 29:31.632
to put your résumé together
and clean out your desk.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.865
He's nuts about me.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.428
<i>It was one night.
It was tennis.</i>

29:35.507 --> 29:37.839
It was the only night we had
the same night off together

29:37.909 --> 29:38.933
for, like, two weeks.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.500
We're together
every night anyway.

29:40.578 --> 29:41.875
At midnight!

29:41.946 --> 29:44.176
We go back to my place
or we go back to your place.

29:44.249 --> 29:45.512
We have a lot of sex.

29:45.583 --> 29:46.709
We watch
"The 2:00 A.M. Wrap-up."

29:46.785 --> 29:48.480
We go to sleep.
We come to work.

29:48.553 --> 29:50.885
What kind of a relationship
is that?

29:50.955 --> 29:52.548
It's working out
pretty well for me.

29:53.825 --> 29:57.056
It was a joke! I made a joke!
I like to make you laugh.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.857
Why? Because I like you
very much.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.921
Jeremy, it wasn't the greatest
joke I've ever heard.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.558
I never said I was opening
for Jack Benny.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.295
-- You meant Henny Youngman.
-- I meant Jack Benny.

30:04.369 --> 30:06.030
Jack Benny plays the clarinet.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.402
Jack Benny plays the violin. For
that matter, so does Henny Youngman.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.907
But you're thinking
of Benny Goodman.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.339
Do you really always
have to be right?

30:11.409 --> 30:13.104
-- No. -- Then why are
you still talking?

30:13.178 --> 30:14.839
-- <i>'Cause</i> I <i>am right.</i>
-- <i>Could have guessed.</i>

30:14.913 --> 30:16.403
Hey, if we're gonna fight, can
it not be about Henny Youngman?

30:16.481 --> 30:18.381
We're not fighting
about Henny Youngman.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.249
We're fighting because instead
of going to the movies with me,

30:21.319 --> 30:24.846
-- you decided to play tennis with Judy
Rootie-tootie. -- You guys getting all this?

30:24.923 --> 30:28.052
You know someone
named Judy Rootie-tootie?

30:28.126 --> 30:29.890
-- Judy Reston-Taylor.
-- The actress?

30:29.961 --> 30:32.225
-- We went to school together. -- I
hear she's great in that new thing.

30:32.297 --> 30:35.392
-- Thank you, Siskel & Ebert!
-- Natalie!

30:35.467 --> 30:37.595
Hey, we're playing poker in the
conference room. You guys in?

30:37.669 --> 30:38.727
Natalie and I can't play.

30:38.803 --> 30:40.430
It's important we spend these
precious moments together.

30:40.505 --> 30:43.031
Oh, there'll be no precious
moments tonight, darling.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.940
-- You know what I mean?
-- I think I do.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.478
-- No precious moments of any kind.
-- I understand.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.240
If, however,
your arrogance extends

30:49.314 --> 30:51.806
to thinking you're a better
poker player than I am,

30:51.883 --> 30:54.113
you are welcome to join me
at the card table

30:54.185 --> 30:56.779
so that I can wipe that
smug smile off your face

30:56.855 --> 30:59.153
and teach you a lesson
you so richly deserve.

30:59.224 --> 31:00.919
Natalie, do you even know
how to play poker?

31:00.992 --> 31:02.391
The guys at Sigma Kappa Pi

31:02.460 --> 31:04.986
let me play in their poker
game any time I wanted.

31:05.063 --> 31:06.588
Now, why do you suppose
that was?

31:06.664 --> 31:08.462
'Cause you're a knockout
and your parents are loaded?

31:08.533 --> 31:10.433
'Cause I got game, baby.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.163
Have you fallen on your head?

31:12.237 --> 31:14.137
Or are you just afraid
I might humiliate you

31:14.205 --> 31:16.674
and you won't be able to go
to Sundance with Judy the ho?

31:17.976 --> 31:22.174
I tell you, Casey, it appears some
time has freed up in my schedule,

31:22.247 --> 31:24.306
and I just might be able to
play cards with you after all.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.907
Rack 'em up, Casey.

31:25.984 --> 31:28.646
That's pool,
you mental patient!

31:28.720 --> 31:30.620
-- It's gonna be a fun night.
-- Oh, yeah. -- Oh, yeah.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.025
I can't believe
how not in the zone I am.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.359
It's really pretty startling
how little time it takes

31:39.431 --> 31:41.729
to go from being in the zone
to being not in the zone.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.824
Yeah.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.892
Tell them about the time
I was in the zone.

31:44.969 --> 31:46.664
There was a time
he was in the zone.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.070
-- <i>Beautiful.</i> -- <i>Yes, it
was, but you know what?</i>

31:49.140 --> 31:50.972
-- What? -- That's yesterday's news.
You're what was.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.373
Look at your cards
and make a bet.

31:53.478 --> 31:56.277
-- Fold.
-- <i>Call.</i>

31:56.347 --> 31:57.746
Shoe money tonight!

31:57.816 --> 32:00.342
-- Would you stop that?
-- Isaac's a little cranky.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.251
It seems when he was growing up, he
didn't get enough calcium and vitamin D.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.380
<i>8 -- possible flush.</i>

32:05.457 --> 32:07.755
6 -- no help.
Queen -- no help.

32:07.826 --> 32:08.918
Aces bet.

32:10.595 --> 32:11.653
$10.

32:11.729 --> 32:12.958
-- Natalie...
-- $10.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.362
Don't you think you owe me
enough money?

32:14.432 --> 32:17.060
<i>I was taught to play poker
by the boys of Sigma Kappa Pi.</i>

32:17.135 --> 32:18.102
I'm doin' fine.

32:18.169 --> 32:20.763
Natalie, you owe me,
like, $700,000.

32:20.839 --> 32:23.809
I'm basically your landlord
at this point.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.240
Stop playing!

32:25.310 --> 32:27.142
Jealous of the frat boys?

32:27.212 --> 32:29.271
There are times you're
not that easy to love.

32:29.347 --> 32:30.974
How are my guys?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.209
Us?

32:35.286 --> 32:38.381
We are putting together
a great show for you guys.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.721
<i>-- Good. -- Well, "great" is relative.
It's just "The 2:00 A.M."</i>

32:41.793 --> 32:45.991
<i>On your show, though, man, I could
really do my thing -- I mean let it fly!</i>

32:46.064 --> 32:47.998
Sally, can I talk to you
a second?

32:48.066 --> 32:50.626
-- Guess there's only one Dana
Whitaker, though. -- Sally.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.228
I have a hunch Dana's about
to make that point right now.

32:53.304 --> 32:54.601
Pair of kings.

32:54.672 --> 32:57.403
-- Trip aces.
-- <i>Ahh.</i>

32:57.475 --> 32:58.670
Straight to the jack.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.404
-- Can I say something?
-- Sure.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.242
Of my entire roster
of boyfriends,

33:02.313 --> 33:04.611
and it is, believe me,
quite the lengthy list,

33:04.682 --> 33:05.945
you are my least favorite.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.008
Hey, I'm just happy
to be on the team.

33:08.086 --> 33:12.353
On segments
10,12,and...13 --

33:12.423 --> 33:14.585
I really don't want to get
into a little thing with you.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.492
No, you really don't.
On segments 10, 12, and 13 --

33:17.562 --> 33:19.462
No, I-I'm just saying
"The 2:00 A.M." is my show.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.762
-- And you do a good job. -- Yeah,
I'm not staying there forever, Dana.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.598
I have got people talking
to me -- MSNBC --

33:24.669 --> 33:27.366
Sally, I don't really care
that much about your life.

33:27.438 --> 33:29.133
Well, look
who's the belle of the ball.

33:29.207 --> 33:31.676
Right. On segments 10, 12,
and 13 --

33:31.743 --> 33:34.610
-- What about them? -- Casey's not
gonna want to do it this way.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.671
He likes to break up the highlights
with features or remotes.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.878
-- Casey approves your rundowns?
-- No, but that's me.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.046
We've been working together
a really long time.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.112
It's like a marriage.
He trusts me.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.486
VVith you -- and I hope you
don't take this personally --

33:46.558 --> 33:48.856
with you, he's gonna want
to approve the rundown.

33:48.927 --> 33:51.862
-- He already approved it.
-- N-- he approved it?

33:51.930 --> 33:55.025
-- <i>He said it was fine.</i>
-- <i>He said it was fine?</i>

33:55.099 --> 33:56.567
Well, he didn't really
look at it,

33:56.634 --> 33:59.467
but he said, “Hey, you're the producer.
Whatever you think is best.“

33:59.537 --> 34:01.665
-- Huh. He said that?
-- Yeah.

34:01.739 --> 34:03.298
Huh. Interesting.
[Chuckles]

34:03.374 --> 34:05.570
Can I -- do y-- can I ask
-- did he say it like,

34:05.643 --> 34:08.476
[Nonohalantly] “Hey, you're the producer.
Whatever you think is best“

34:08.545 --> 34:12.312
or did he say it like, “You're the
producer. Whatever you think is best.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.351
"It doesn't really matter
since I know

34:14.418 --> 34:16.387
Dana's gonna look over the rundown
and take care of it anyway“?

34:16.454 --> 34:18.149
The first one.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.384
[Laughing]
Oh, interesting.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.187
You've got a little thing
for Casey, don't you?

34:22.260 --> 34:24.695
I can't tell you how little
a thing I don't have.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.389
It's okay.
He's very cute.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.833
Recently divorced, makes a ton of money,
and I'm sure he's got good contacts.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.893
You know, I don't mind telling
you I could really go for him.

34:32.971 --> 34:36.601
We don't even need to have a relationship
-- just the sex and the contacts.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.877
My friendship with you is
the important thing, Dana.

34:39.944 --> 34:42.208
L-I really mean that, and I
don't want anything to get --

34:42.280 --> 34:45.215
Oh, Sally, I can tell you're
starting to open up to me a little,

34:45.283 --> 34:48.775
and I think that's great, but I'm pretty
much done talking with you right now.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.378
-- We'll have drinks?
-- Absolutely.

34:50.455 --> 34:53.219
-- See ya.
-- Okay.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.958
Jacks and 4's.

34:57.027 --> 34:58.860
Trip 5's.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.295
Straight.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.560
[Sighs]

35:01.633 --> 35:03.362
I know why you're beating me
so much.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.027
It's 'cause you're not
a very good poker player.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.265
-- That's not why.
-- It really is.

35:07.338 --> 35:10.103
Or isn't it just possible that
you're sitting in the good chair?!

35:10.174 --> 35:14.304
No. What is possible is that
the boys from Sigma Kappa Pi

35:14.379 --> 35:16.973
are a big honking bunch
of losers!

35:18.016 --> 35:20.815
-- What <i>did</i> I <i>miss?</i> -- <i>Nata!fe's pretty
much divested herself of possessions.</i>

35:20.885 --> 35:22.284
I'm mounting a comeback.

35:22.353 --> 35:25.584
Isaac --
did somebody step on Isaac?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.557
Oh, no, there you are.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.617
-- You still work here? -- I'M
never leave you, little <i>buddy!</i>

35:30.695 --> 35:32.857
-- Casey...
-- Yep? Ow!

35:32.930 --> 35:34.728
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

35:34.799 --> 35:35.891
Yes.

35:38.036 --> 35:41.062
-- You approved Sally's rundown?
-- Yeah.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.834
-- You approved it?
-- Yes.

35:42.907 --> 35:46.571
-- Just like that, it was approved? --
VVell, I didn't hold confirmation hearings.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.840
No, you just approved it
without even looking at it.

35:48.913 --> 35:51.644
-- I never need to approve your rundowns.
-- That's right.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.846
-- I have done something wrong, but
for the life of me -- -- Casey...

35:55.920 --> 35:58.855
-- We're about to have a little
talk, aren't we? -- Oh, yes.

35:58.923 --> 36:01.051
Isn't osteoporosis
pretty common?

36:01.125 --> 36:03.924
Very common, especially
among Caucasian women.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.963
-- Bummer.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

36:06.030 --> 36:07.520
What are you gonna do
with your old suits?

36:07.598 --> 36:10.363
-- I was thinking about shoving
them up your -- -- No problem.

36:10.435 --> 36:13.029
I'm taking a break
if anyone wants my seat.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.538
It's the good chair.

36:14.605 --> 36:16.164
I'm just gonna run
to the bathroom.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.265
You want to come with me
to the bathroom, Dan?

36:20.044 --> 36:21.512
Why, no, Jeremy, I don't.

36:21.579 --> 36:23.513
<i>You don't want to step
outside with me</i>

36:23.614 --> 36:25.582
and talk on our way
to the bathroom?

36:28.086 --> 36:29.713
Sure.

36:29.787 --> 36:32.017
We're just stepping out
and going to the bathroom.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.127
I didn't really have to go
to the bathroom.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.822
-- Really?
-- I just wanted to talk.

36:38.896 --> 36:40.796
I don't think anyone saw
through your clever ruse.

36:40.865 --> 36:44.130
-- I am in the doghouse with Natalie.
-- Come in my office.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.105
It's a new relationship. Clearly I've broken
some rule that no one ever taught me.

36:48.172 --> 36:51.369
-- You played tennis with your friends instead
of going out with her? -- Right. Yes.

36:51.442 --> 36:55.037
-- And one of those friends happened
to be a beautiful actress? -- Yes.

36:55.113 --> 36:56.877
-- Dude.
-- I know.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.610
-- You're very wise to come to me
with this problem. -- Thank you.

37:01.686 --> 37:05.884
-- Natalie is angry because she doesn't understand
a fundamental principle. -- What's that?

37:05.957 --> 37:07.652
-- The principle?
-- Yeah.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.990
A man's past is more important
to him than his future.

37:11.062 --> 37:11.995
Ahh.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.326
-- You understand?
-- No.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.887
-- <i>Neither</i> do <i>women.</i>
-- <i>I know how they feel.</i>

37:14.966 --> 37:16.331
You have to stand firm
on this, Jeremy.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.061
Sooner or later she's
gonna realize she's wrong,

37:18.136 --> 37:19.797
and when she does,
you have to stand firm.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.033
You can't forgive her right away.
She needs a little punishment.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.474
-- <i>What kind of punishment?</i>
-- <i>I'd withhold sex.</i>

37:24.575 --> 37:25.872
You would?
That sounds like it would be

37:25.910 --> 37:27.207
way worse for me
than it would for her.

37:27.278 --> 37:28.404
Education isn't easy.

37:29.614 --> 37:32.811
-- You don't have any idea what you're
talking about, do you? -- On this, no.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.545
-- Part of what you said is true.
-- Really?

37:34.619 --> 37:38.556
I have to stand firm -- not to establish
an upper hand but to establish equality.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.682
-- <i>Exactly.</i>
-- <i>We'll have an argument,</i>

37:40.758 --> 37:42.954
and she will take a position
that absolutely defies logic.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.961
Now, I have a pretty
healthy respect for logic,

37:45.029 --> 37:47.088
but then all she has to do
is put on one of my shirts.

37:47.165 --> 37:49.657
-- The shirt. -- She'll grab a
white dress shirt from my closet.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.429
-- You're cooked. That's it.
-- It's over.

37:51.502 --> 37:54.403
-- Like bishop to queen's rook 7.
-- <i>Keep</i> going.

37:54.472 --> 37:55.633
My chess team
is playing Lakeland.

37:55.706 --> 37:58.232
<i>I start my match
king's pawn 3, king's pawn 3,</i>

37:58.309 --> 38:01.244
bam, bam, bam. All of a sudden, the
guy moves bishop to queen's rook 7.

38:01.312 --> 38:03.872
I lost 32 moves later,
but I was never even in it.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.473
Right.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.712
And that relates to Natalie
wearing your shirt how?

38:07.785 --> 38:10.083
I have to stand firm.
Thank you.

38:10.154 --> 38:11.986
Right.

38:12.056 --> 38:13.990
<i>I have worked very hard
over the years</i>

38:14.058 --> 38:16.459
to learn what you like
and what you don't like,

38:16.527 --> 38:18.427
what works for you
and what doesn't,

38:18.496 --> 38:20.487
and it's very discouraging
to learn it turns out

38:20.565 --> 38:22.124
you've been taking it
for granted.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.999
-- I haven't been taking it for granted.
-- You've been taking it for granted.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.002
You think Sally and I operate
at the same level,

38:27.038 --> 38:28.665
and since you don't approve
my rundowns,

38:28.739 --> 38:30.571
well, then, there's no reason
to approve hers.

38:30.641 --> 38:34.305
Sally -- you know, Sally? Do you
understand what I'm talking about?

38:34.378 --> 38:36.278
-- Sally.
-- Yes.

38:36.347 --> 38:40.875
Let me try this. You are so good at
your job and Sally is so not that much

38:40.952 --> 38:42.613
that the actual dichotomy --

38:42.687 --> 38:44.678
-- the phenomenal -- -- You're pathetic!
You know that?

38:44.755 --> 38:46.746
I didn't want to bring this up,
but it seems to me --

38:46.824 --> 38:48.223
and I'm just speaking
as a friend --

38:48.292 --> 38:49.919
it seems to me
that your jealousy of Sally

38:49.994 --> 38:52.395
doesn't have quite as much to
do with her professional acumen

38:52.463 --> 38:53.760
as you would lead us
to believe.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.857
Whoa, there, Huckleberry.
Come on back to the stable.

38:56.934 --> 38:59.130
First of all, Sally doesn't
have any professional acumen,

38:59.203 --> 39:01.501
and second of all, what the
hell are you talking about?

39:01.572 --> 39:03.370
I'm just saying that
it's hard not to notice

39:03.441 --> 39:05.034
that the woman's body
was put together

39:05.109 --> 39:07.168
by a technician
very close to God.

39:07.245 --> 39:09.805
A technician close to God?

39:09.881 --> 39:11.144
Not God himself,
but certainly

39:11.215 --> 39:12.842
a high-level staff person --
a senior V.P.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.851
Well, her brain
was put together

39:14.919 --> 39:17.388
by the assistant night guy
at the 7-Eleven.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.355
Well, maybe so, but I think
the source of your problem --

39:19.423 --> 39:22.688
-- ls her body?! -- Her legs do
go all the way down to the floor,

39:22.760 --> 39:24.888
and she's gonna be
whispering in my ear

39:24.962 --> 39:26.157
for 30 minutes.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.255
Well, one of the things
she's gonna be whispering

39:28.332 --> 39:29.800
is, "Stand by, 14,"
which will be

39:29.867 --> 39:32.336
your third straight highlight
without a break for a feature.

39:32.403 --> 39:36.704
She's got cameras 2 and 3 as your
primaries, Dan's doing the soccer,

39:36.774 --> 39:39.368
and...two of your intros
contain puns.

39:39.443 --> 39:40.911
-- Puns?
-- Puns.

39:40.978 --> 39:42.878
-- There are puns? Puns.
-- <i>Yes.</i> Bad <i>ones.</i>

39:42.947 --> 39:44.039
-- ls there such a thing
as a good one? -- No.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.083

anything about this?

39:46.150 --> 39:48.244
Well, sorry, pal.

-- <i>Help me out.</i>
-- <i>I'm gonna go play poker.</i>

39:50.154 --> 39:52.646
You're gonna go play cards while
I'm doing puns on camera 3?

39:52.723 --> 39:54.748
It's time to kick back.

39:56.427 --> 39:58.486
Sally!

40:03.234 --> 40:04.395
Last card.

40:06.737 --> 40:07.932
Who's still alive?

40:08.005 --> 40:09.700
Isaac, Natalie, and Jeremy.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.072
-- You give Casey a talking to?
-- Yes, I did.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.770

mean anything, Dana.

How do you know
I don't have a big house?

41:13.204 --> 41:16.663
A fuH house. Dan already
folded the 6 you needed,

41:16.741 --> 41:17.970

41:18.042 --> 41:21.068
You don't have a house of any sort.
You don't have a pup tent.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.275
I want you to trust me
right now.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.079
I want you to say to yourself, “Yeah,
I've dated a string of jerks in my life.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.283
“They were stupid, they were mean to
me, but maybe this one's different.

"Maybe I should take
a chance

before he breaks my heart' strategy.“

I want you to remember that
when I started liking you,

41:40.664 --> 41:42.655
I didn't stop liking tennis,

41:42.733 --> 41:45.327

to be threatened by,

41:46.971 --> 41:48.700
no matter how glamorous
you think she is.

41:48.773 --> 41:52.710
But mostly I want you
to trust me just once

41:52.810 --> 41:56.007

that you have three 7's...

41:56.080 --> 41:57.809

-- No, I really am.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.674
This is gonna take some time.

42:34.752 --> 42:36.811
Maybe you could take me
back to your apartment

42:36.887 --> 42:38.821
and I can accelerate
the healing process.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.859
No, I don't think so, Natalie. I don't think
you should be rewarded for your behavior.

42:52.002 --> 42:54.232
You're probably right.

42:55.973 --> 42:57.600
I've got no clothes
at your place anyway,

to wear one of your shirts,
