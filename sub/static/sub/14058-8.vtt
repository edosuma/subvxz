[ Cael ] Do you really
think Dad has a plan?

00:05.573 --> 00:11.445
He stole the money.
Ma lost the money. And now we're
here in a dead guy's house.

Gonna get caught, Di.

Hi. Doug Rich.
Oh, hey.

Welcome to Panco, Doug.
I hope your time here
is fruitful.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.495

doing here?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.830

Just bring back
the money, D.

Dale wants $40,000.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.348
That's a lot
of silverware, Dad.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.750
Goddamn small bills.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.820
Hey, isn't this what got us
in trouble in the first place?

How long are we gonna stay?
We get in, we get out.

I want an oath of protection.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.159
The car's right outside.
Come on. Let's go.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.564
Dad, those people have been
staring at us.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.867
No, honey, it's just
your imagination.
Hey, take your coat.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.703
Well, why can't we just
park the R.V. at our house?

01:42.736 --> 01:45.239
They won't let it
through the gate, buddy.
It's too ugly.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.308
It's our home.

Not anymore.
This is a bad idea.

- We're gonna blend right in.
- They're gonna break in
the minute we leave.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.187
Maybe they're nice.
Maybe they're
just like us.

with Travellers or not.

Hey. Hey!

02:14.768 --> 02:18.172
I said, "Hey."
What are you, deaf?

02:18.206 --> 02:21.675
No, I'm not deaf,
but I sometimes get a buzzing
in my ears. Does that count?

02:21.709 --> 02:24.745
What she's tryin' to say
is, there's a fee.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.914
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
I knew it.
- Dahlia.

02:26.947 --> 02:30.818
You know what?
You ain't got no right
charging me no fee, buddy boy.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.920
True, we have no right.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.424
But it's 200 bucks.
That'll cover the first week.

02:36.457 --> 02:40.561
- Yeah, and we'll keep an eye
on it for you guys.
- Don't you pay him, Wayne.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.631

nothing to worry about.

Come on.
We gotta get back to work.

02:53.707 --> 02:57.345
Screw work.
We've been gone two days.

the other little thing.

What, you mean
the money we stole?

He's crazy.

He thinks someone robbed him,
stole $40,000 from his safe.

The 40 grand in my safe.
Ring a bell?

04:26.767 --> 04:30.538
You saying you suspect us?
I suspect everybody
who works for me--

04:30.571 --> 04:34.708
everybody that had access to
Panco on the day of the crime.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.411
Hugh, as your counsel,
I must warn you...

04:37.445 --> 04:40.648
that forcing your employees to
undertake a lie detector test...

04:40.681 --> 04:44.652
- is completely illegal.
- Mm-hmm.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.555
Potential liability is enormous.
It's scientifically useless.
Am I right?

04:47.588 --> 04:50.524
Where the hell have you been
for that last two days?

You're the head
of Legal, Doug.

'cause you ate a bad shrimp.

Now, you're gonna
tell me where you were,

05:04.738 --> 05:07.375
and you're gonna
tell me the truth.

Okay, Doug,
you're on the hot seat.

05:38.439 --> 05:42.476
I was in Florida,
in Boca Raton,

working on a new
investor for you.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.617
An investor?

current cash flow situation.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.958
So who took the money?

05:57.991 --> 06:01.094
I don't frigging know!

06:01.128 --> 06:04.832
So why didn't you just tell me
you had an investor, Doug?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.701
Because I was trying
to keep it quiet,

06:07.735 --> 06:12.573
because it was
supposed to be your
end-of-the-quarter surprise.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.675
Hmm.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.577
Who is he?

06:18.879 --> 06:21.615
Well, that was
part of the surprise.

06:21.649 --> 06:26.954
It is a very delicate...
personal relationship,

06:26.987 --> 06:30.524

not quite closed yet.

Well, you better
close that deal, Doug.

You better close it.
How much you got him
on the line for?

I had no choice.

You signed us up
for $500,000?

So we need to find a mark
that's rich, greedy
and stupid enough...

So, Mr. Abbott,

34:03.242 --> 34:07.213
I think you'll find the price
of three million dollars...

34:07.246 --> 34:09.381
is more than fair.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.618
And I strongly suspect that you
will find it very difficult...

34:12.651 --> 34:15.854
to get that price from
any other buyer, especially
considering that your land...

34:15.887 --> 34:20.259

zoning restrictions...

34:20.292 --> 34:24.696
and that no development
is possible upon your land.

I know the development
was one of the things
you were hoping for.

was one of your hopes.

- Mr. Abbott!
- Yes? Yes, I had
hoped to develop.

socially conscious,

would be perfect...

We will build a visitor center
for this bird sanctuary,

which will be called the Abbott
Aviary Habitat Visitor Center.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.848
Whoever can say that quickly
will win an award.

35:16.882 --> 35:21.687
This is the idea, this is
the scope of what we want to do
with your beautiful land.

35:21.720 --> 35:26.258
And we will buy your land
for twice what you
paid for it in 1974.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.700

There you go.
It's all yours.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.822
Thank you, Mr. Abbott.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.758
- If you would
just follow Helen here.
- This way, Mr. Abbott.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.328
Say, you know,
can I just ask one thing?

36:02.361 --> 36:05.897
- [ Wayne ] Afraid we have
no more time for questions.
- Uh, aren't you Rudy Blue?

36:07.466 --> 36:09.568
Yep, that's me.

36:09.601 --> 36:11.703
Hey, shit the bed,
I thought so.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.939
I thought that-- You--
You know, I gotta tell you,

36:13.972 --> 36:16.975
- you are my favorite
player of all time.
- Thank you. Thank you.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.311
Well, thank you for that,
Mr. Abbott. So, I just--

36:19.345 --> 36:23.415
My God, man.
Hey, and I say this
from my heart.

36:23.449 --> 36:26.918
You have got to lay off
that underage pussy!

36:29.455 --> 36:31.390
Baby.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.596
Hey, look,
can't I just stay and watch?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.998
[ Di Di ] Look, you just sold
three million dollars' worth
of land, buddy.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.268
You don't just stand around
and watch after that.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.504
I know. But if I
can get his autograph,
I can sell it on eBay.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.873
This'll cover the autograph.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.742
Well, I--

36:50.776 --> 36:53.645
And so,
ladies and gentlemen,

36:53.679 --> 36:57.449
say good-bye to the Abbott
Aviary Habitat Visitor Center,

36:57.483 --> 37:00.552
and say hello
to Edenfalls II.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.432
Gated, of course,
to keep out the riffraff.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.603
A safe, secure community.

37:17.636 --> 37:20.539
A safe, secure investment.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.008
And you're sure the protection
is gonna be lifted on Monday?

37:23.041 --> 37:25.777
I'm sure as sure.
I happen to have some photos...

37:25.811 --> 37:28.447
of Mr. Undersecretary
underneath his secretary.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.050
So we are assured
of his assurance.
[ Chuckles ]

37:32.083 --> 37:34.486
I'm in.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.556
- Sounds good.
- [ Wayne ] Very good.
Now if you could just turn...

37:37.589 --> 37:40.726
to the red folder,
the limited partnership
agreement, and sign that,

37:40.759 --> 37:42.594
that would be wonderful.

Oh, Rudy, come on.
No, no, no, no, no.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.043
Is there a problem?

37:58.076 --> 38:02.648
No. Rudy?
There's no problem.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.883
No. There's no problem,
is there?

38:07.353 --> 38:10.689
Listen, it's extortion.
It's illegal.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.891
Well, it's only
a little illegal.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.394
Yeah, but it's illegal.

38:15.427 --> 38:19.465
I just got out of jail.
I-- I can't do stuff like this.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.734
When you've done that,
then if you could please
phone your bankers...

- Who is this? What's going on?
- You didn't tell me
there'd be cops.

All right. Everyone calm down.
Agent Chin, I'm sure
we can work something out.

a very good investment--
33% over two years.

you know, I'm still in prison.

Very good. Here we go.

I persuaded him that real estate
is a solid investment.

to remain anonymous.

a very shy man.

into it, Doug?

trust is an important thing,
