WEBVTT

04:27.819 --> 04:31.019
Is that Marsha's sister?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.855
What do we call her?

04:32.857 --> 04:35.056
Aunt Jean.

04:35.058 --> 04:36.926
She looks nicer than Marsha.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.728
She does.

04:38.730 --> 04:39.962
Hey.

04:39.964 --> 04:41.931
- Hi Libby.
- Hi.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.232
Thank you so much for having us.

04:44.234 --> 04:46.936
Oh, you're always welcome here.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.638
Thanks.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.540
- Oh.
- Who are these two beauties?

04:50.542 --> 04:53.174
Well, um, this little one
is Tank

04:53.176 --> 04:55.678
and this big one is Abby.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.514
Hello, nice to meet you both.

04:58.516 --> 05:00.716
Are those wands you have there?

05:00.718 --> 05:02.552
Why don't you go over there
and try to turn that goat

05:02.554 --> 05:04.353
into a goose?

05:04.355 --> 05:06.221
- Might work.
- It's okay.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.356
Go ahead.

05:07.358 --> 05:09.926
Just be careful.

05:09.928 --> 05:11.394
Goats don't bite, do they?

05:11.396 --> 05:12.695
Course they do, they're goats.

05:13.998 --> 05:15.798
Watch your fingers!

05:18.235 --> 05:19.802
It's so soft.

05:19.804 --> 05:21.472
Wow.

05:22.373 --> 05:25.374
That's one of
my favourite pieces.

05:25.376 --> 05:27.075
Frank always thought of himself
as an artist

05:27.077 --> 05:30.111
and I guess I did, too.

05:30.113 --> 05:31.547
He made that.

05:31.549 --> 05:32.348
Yeah.

05:32.350 --> 05:34.884
Who's Frank?

05:34.886 --> 05:38.354
Frank was my husband.

05:38.356 --> 05:40.221
Although we never married.

05:40.223 --> 05:42.959
He passed 10 years ago.

05:42.961 --> 05:46.062
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:46.064 --> 05:47.630
He did that one up there, too.

05:47.632 --> 05:52.969
Oh wow, that's um,
it's very um, rustic.

05:52.971 --> 05:53.669
You done?

05:53.671 --> 05:55.938
Frank was a fan of imperfection.

05:55.940 --> 05:59.174
Yeah, I can tell.

05:59.176 --> 06:01.209
Hey, are you full?

06:01.211 --> 06:03.178
Aunt Jean,
where is your dishwasher?

06:03.180 --> 06:04.647
You're looking at it, kiddo.

06:04.649 --> 06:05.848
You don't have a dishwasher?

06:05.850 --> 06:09.418
No dishwasher, no clothes dryer,
no microwave.

06:09.420 --> 06:13.522
- TV?
- No, no TV.

06:13.524 --> 06:17.593
Well, um, I hope you have
a bathtub,

06:17.595 --> 06:20.529
'cause it's time for these two
to get ready for bed.

06:20.531 --> 06:22.565
No, why don't you do the dishes
and I'll take them up.

06:22.567 --> 06:23.799
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.701
Uh, I... we just have our l...
we have a routine.

06:25.703 --> 06:27.670
It's fine.

06:27.672 --> 06:29.739
Come on.

06:29.741 --> 06:30.873
Okay.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.308
Hey.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.178
You guys be good.

06:37.180 --> 06:41.617
The dish soap is where
you might expect it to be.

06:41.619 --> 06:42.918
Okay.

07:02.140 --> 07:03.639
Cool scar.

07:03.641 --> 07:06.742
I got it in the car crash
with my dad.

07:06.744 --> 07:09.645
Here, this one's my favourite.

07:09.647 --> 07:11.480
It looks like a crescent moon.

07:11.482 --> 07:12.748
Mine looks like a river.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.251
Yes, they mighty Mississippi.

07:15.253 --> 07:16.819
Come on, let's go.

07:16.821 --> 07:18.389
Bed time.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.365
Oh.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.434
Thanks.

07:31.436 --> 07:33.102
I thought you might like that.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.171
- Oh yeah.
- There you go.

07:35.173 --> 07:36.474
It's cold.

07:42.747 --> 07:44.549
Oh.

07:45.683 --> 07:46.649
Oh!

07:46.651 --> 07:49.151
There they are,
thank you.

07:55.293 --> 07:57.593
You know, this won't be forever
just until I get us back

07:57.595 --> 07:59.295
- on our feet.
- Yeah.

07:59.297 --> 08:02.398
And I know
it's a lot with the kids.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.466
It's just after Danny,

08:03.468 --> 08:05.201
everything kinda just got away
from me

08:05.203 --> 08:08.471
and it's hard to lose
your person and your whole life

08:08.473 --> 08:09.472
in a year.

08:11.375 --> 08:15.177
I really appreciate
you inviting us to stay.

08:15.179 --> 08:18.447
I think it's gonna be
a little weird for a while.

08:18.449 --> 08:19.949
You don't really know
what I'm made of

08:19.951 --> 08:22.685
and I bet your mother's probably
filled your head with

08:22.687 --> 08:26.122
a lot of chicken shit about me.

08:26.124 --> 08:27.123
Well...

08:28.993 --> 08:29.992
And you know Marsha,

08:29.994 --> 08:33.562
she's got a lot to say
about a lot of things.

08:33.564 --> 08:34.697
But I do remember you though,

08:34.699 --> 08:37.800
I remember seeing you
at Granddaddy's funeral.

08:37.802 --> 08:39.502
You and mom were fighting.

08:39.504 --> 08:41.036
Oh yeah.

08:41.038 --> 08:43.239
I was a doozy.

08:43.241 --> 08:47.943
And your mother always was
a stellar sort of asshole.

08:47.945 --> 08:52.014
But let's not talk about things
that make us wanna punch holes

08:52.016 --> 08:53.684
in a sheetrock.

09:01.325 --> 09:03.260
You have a lot of pets.

09:03.262 --> 09:04.794
- We don't call 'em pets.
- Oh.

09:04.796 --> 09:07.163
On a farm, they're animals.

09:07.165 --> 09:09.131
And they all have jobs.

09:09.133 --> 09:13.102
The hens lay eggs,
the cats keep the mice away,

09:13.104 --> 09:16.038
the dogs protect the chickens
from the coyotes,

09:16.040 --> 09:17.642
and the goats make milk.

09:20.244 --> 09:21.243
What's his job?

09:23.614 --> 09:24.780
Thanksgiving.

09:37.395 --> 09:39.361
Yes.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.268
Just in case you get cold.

09:45.336 --> 09:46.271
Thanks.

09:49.373 --> 09:51.040
Happy new year.

09:57.815 --> 10:00.583
Yeah, happy new year.

10:13.431 --> 10:14.997
You both are doing a good job.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.599
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

10:16.601 --> 10:17.933
Thank you.

10:17.935 --> 10:19.271
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

10:20.638 --> 10:22.771
There she is.

10:22.773 --> 10:24.039
Aunt Jean made pancakes

10:24.041 --> 10:26.442
and I had a dream
I was a cute pink goat.

10:26.444 --> 10:29.144
All goats are cute,
pink or not.

10:29.146 --> 10:31.046
Try this jam, mama,
Jean made it.

10:32.251 --> 10:35.150
Strawberries and blueberries
from that field in the back.

10:35.152 --> 10:37.419
Jean said we could pick 'em
in the summer.

10:37.421 --> 10:39.421
And this was Wiggy the piggy.

10:39.423 --> 10:40.689
She's delicious.

10:40.691 --> 10:42.658
She was a good pig.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.226
What would you like
in your espresso?

10:44.228 --> 10:48.097
Wait, you don't have
a dishwasher, but you have this?

10:48.099 --> 10:50.399
When it comes to coffee,
I don't mess around.

10:57.775 --> 11:00.743
This is James O'Connor,
my farm manager.

11:00.745 --> 11:02.312
Would you please
quit calling me that.

11:02.314 --> 11:05.315
You make it sound like
I got a desk out in the barn.

11:06.751 --> 11:09.818
You must be the uh,
the long lost niece.

11:09.820 --> 11:12.322
Uh, yeah, that's me.

11:12.324 --> 11:13.356
Nice to meet you.

11:13.358 --> 11:16.191
This beautiful girl is Abby

11:16.193 --> 11:18.661
and the tall, dark,
and handsome one is Tank.

11:18.663 --> 11:20.129
How you doing?
It's just grease.

11:20.131 --> 11:22.231
- Where do you live?
- Where do I live?

11:22.233 --> 11:24.733
I live right out front there
in that silver bullet.

11:24.735 --> 11:26.101
You look like a werewolf.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.937
- Abby.
- I...

11:27.939 --> 11:30.172
I look like a were...
or maybe I am a werewolf.

11:31.075 --> 11:32.741
Don't worry, Abby, he's human.

11:32.743 --> 11:35.210
O'Connor's gonna teach your mama
how to run the farm.

11:35.212 --> 11:35.878
- What?
- What?

11:35.880 --> 11:38.213
What, I'm sorry what?

11:38.215 --> 11:40.082
- What?
- I need help, you need a job,

11:40.084 --> 11:42.051
and he's not gonna stay around
forever.

11:42.053 --> 11:44.653
Oh, I... trust me,
I know I need a job,

11:44.655 --> 11:47.022
but I'm not sure
I'm the farming type.

11:47.024 --> 11:48.791
Yeah, totally agree with that.

11:48.793 --> 11:49.825
You don't know me.

11:49.827 --> 11:52.628
Well, you're the one
who just said it.

11:52.630 --> 11:55.030
Well, I... I can...
I can just tell.

11:55.032 --> 11:56.198
Tell what?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.900
You know what, I don't...
the point is

11:57.902 --> 11:59.336
it's not a good idea.

11:59.338 --> 12:00.536
Sure it is.

12:00.538 --> 12:03.038
Drink up, get dressed,
and get outside.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.139
Today?

12:04.141 --> 12:05.040
It's a holiday.

12:05.042 --> 12:06.542
There are no holidays on a farm.

12:06.544 --> 12:07.710
I let you sleep in this morning,

12:07.712 --> 12:09.745
but tomorrow's gonna be
a whole other deal.

12:09.747 --> 12:10.579
Come on, kids.

12:10.581 --> 12:11.613
Let's go see Russ
at the feed store.

12:11.615 --> 12:12.984
- Wait, wait.
- Bye, mommy.

12:13.484 --> 12:14.750
- Love you.
- Wait.

12:14.752 --> 12:15.951
Bye, see you later.

12:15.953 --> 12:16.919
Let's go, let's go.

12:16.921 --> 12:19.855
Be... be... be careful.

12:19.857 --> 12:22.024
Alright, two minutes,
out in the barn.

12:22.026 --> 12:23.058
Where?

12:23.060 --> 12:25.663
That the... that's
the big red structure outback.

12:40.211 --> 12:42.644
Hey, hey, yo.

12:42.646 --> 12:43.981
Here we go.

12:48.253 --> 12:49.685
Okay.

12:49.687 --> 12:50.953
- What is this?
- What?

12:50.955 --> 12:52.455
You don't have a coat.

12:52.457 --> 12:55.657
I forgot it at my mom's.

12:55.659 --> 12:58.395
Well, these are chickens.

12:58.397 --> 13:01.597
And these are goats.

13:01.599 --> 13:02.664
She told me to start
from scratch,

13:02.666 --> 13:03.799
so that's what I'm gonna do.

13:03.801 --> 13:06.035
This one right over here,
that's Ms. Taylor.

13:06.037 --> 13:07.970
The one right
there is Katy Perry

13:07.972 --> 13:09.171
and the one right back
over there

13:09.173 --> 13:11.540
that doesn't belong with anyone,
that's Susan Sontag.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.742
These are Nubians,

13:13.744 --> 13:15.077
the ones with the long,
floppy ears.

13:15.079 --> 13:17.347
We don't have any Alpines,
but we do have a few Lamanchas

13:17.349 --> 13:21.183
and don't show 'em,
we only milk 'em.

13:21.185 --> 13:23.218
- Do they all have names?
- Yeah.

13:23.220 --> 13:26.088
They all got names,
but I just call 'em "goat".

13:26.090 --> 13:28.157
And why do you call her
"Aunt Jean", are you related?

13:28.159 --> 13:28.991
Uh, no, no.

13:28.993 --> 13:30.262
But, she's like family.

13:33.398 --> 13:34.433
I'm fine.

13:36.268 --> 13:37.168
Come on in.

13:40.305 --> 13:42.671
Alright, you gotta wedge it
down first.

13:42.673 --> 13:44.606
You know, I mean everywhere.

13:44.608 --> 13:46.509
Front to back,
not back to front.

13:46.511 --> 13:48.411
Alright, here we go.

13:48.413 --> 13:50.346
Hand me those hoses that's right
over there, will ya?

13:50.348 --> 13:51.782
These, yeah.

13:53.918 --> 13:56.151
You gotta attach these.

13:56.153 --> 13:57.253
Where?

13:57.255 --> 13:58.189
Uh, exactly where you think
you might attach 'em,

13:58.457 --> 14:00.923

15:18.869 --> 15:20.102
Now Jean's got arthritis,

15:20.104 --> 15:22.305
so I guess that makes you
next in line for the throne.

15:22.307 --> 15:24.574
I don't know about that.

15:24.576 --> 15:26.043
Yeah, you're telling me.

15:29.813 --> 15:31.449
Here's the fridge.

15:33.717 --> 15:36.051
Is it all goat cheese?

15:36.053 --> 15:38.854
- Is it good?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:38.856 --> 15:40.956
That's so cool.

15:40.958 --> 15:42.824
You know, with all of this
Jean really could open

15:42.826 --> 15:44.226
a cute little cheese store.

15:44.228 --> 15:46.462
No, please save your ideas
about the hipster cheese shop

15:46.464 --> 15:47.497
for your... your journal.

15:47.499 --> 15:49.198
I don't... I don't really wanna
hear about that.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.601
I don't think that's exactly
what I was saying, but...

15:51.603 --> 15:54.036
Okay.

15:54.038 --> 15:56.004
Okay, I'm... I'm... sounded like
you were talking about

15:56.006 --> 15:58.641
a hipster cheese shop
you wanted to open.

15:58.643 --> 15:59.676
Anyway, it doesn't matter,

15:59.678 --> 16:02.647
this concludes our tour
of the fridge for today.

16:07.285 --> 16:09.117
Here's the rule about gates,

16:09.119 --> 16:11.554
you always wanna leave 'em
the way you found 'em.

16:11.556 --> 16:12.622
If they're open,
you leave 'em open

16:12.624 --> 16:15.190
and if they're closed...

16:15.192 --> 16:16.492
Let me guess,
you leave them closed.

16:16.494 --> 16:17.759
That's right, very good.

16:17.761 --> 16:22.632
Now you just turn it over there
and open it like that, okay?

16:22.634 --> 16:24.034
Here you go then.

16:26.770 --> 16:28.371
Turn it.

16:28.373 --> 16:29.972
Turn it.
You gotta turn it, turn it.

16:29.974 --> 16:31.006
I'm turning.

16:31.008 --> 16:32.176
You gotta turn it, turn it,
turn it, turn it...

16:32.577 --> 16:34.410
- Ow, I'm turning it!
- Turn it, turn it, turn it.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.912
Ow, ow!

16:36.914 --> 16:37.946
- Ow.
- Okay, well,

16:37.948 --> 16:41.116
maybe I should probably
fix that one.

16:41.118 --> 16:42.951
Am I supposed to follow you?

16:42.953 --> 16:44.219
Yep.

16:44.221 --> 16:45.355
Yo.

16:45.357 --> 16:46.489
Yeah.

17:07.279 --> 17:09.379
Can you hold up,
I need to adjust my shoe.

17:23.695 --> 17:26.063
It's beautiful, huh?

18:03.967 --> 18:06.302
Oh, she's alive.

18:06.304 --> 18:07.836
I just sat down
on the edge of the bed

18:07.838 --> 18:09.539
and I fell asleep.

18:09.541 --> 18:10.406
You're late.

18:10.408 --> 18:12.575
No, I'm not,
I just heard the rooster.

18:12.577 --> 18:13.576
Dooby.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.078
He's all over the map.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.013
He's a rooster.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.450
Roosters can't tell time.

18:20.452 --> 18:22.685
Um, okay, I um...
I will come.

18:22.687 --> 18:24.052
I just have to get the kids up
and...

18:24.054 --> 18:25.120
Done!

18:25.122 --> 18:26.656
They're out watering.

18:26.658 --> 18:27.690
They are?

18:27.692 --> 18:31.226
Yeah, I've taught 'em how to use
the rain barrel.

18:31.228 --> 18:32.227
Yeah.

18:32.229 --> 18:34.029
We're gonna go milk the goats.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.264
And I'm gonna have you
run into town,

18:35.266 --> 18:37.132
get some supplies,
you can take my truck.

18:37.134 --> 18:38.301
Okay, okay.

18:38.303 --> 18:39.502
Um, let me just take
a quick shower

18:39.504 --> 18:40.570
- and then I'll come...
- Why?

18:40.572 --> 18:41.637
You don't need to take a shower,

18:41.639 --> 18:44.807
the beauty pageant's
not till Saturday.

18:44.809 --> 18:47.943
I mean goats don't care
what you smell like.

18:47.945 --> 18:50.178
Right?

18:50.180 --> 18:51.381
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

18:51.383 --> 18:53.115
Okay.

18:53.117 --> 18:55.052
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

19:02.025 --> 19:04.527
We need to hire a real hand.

19:04.529 --> 19:06.063
She'll learn.

21:11.556 --> 21:12.790
Okay.

21:20.965 --> 21:22.500
Okay.

21:50.361 --> 21:52.227
There it is.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.896
- Oh.
- Hi!

21:53.898 --> 21:55.798
Hi.

21:59.304 --> 22:01.169
It's just these.

22:01.171 --> 22:02.038
- Oh.
- Yeah.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.073
Good.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.411
Okay.

22:12.650 --> 22:14.817
You married?

22:14.819 --> 22:17.553
Oh, I was.

22:17.555 --> 22:20.155
Hmm, divorced then?

22:20.157 --> 22:22.058
No.

22:22.060 --> 22:24.929
Mysterious, what happened?

22:26.431 --> 22:28.698
He's just gone.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.131
Gone where?

22:30.133 --> 22:32.835
How much do I owe ya?

22:32.837 --> 22:37.974
That would be 48.25.

22:37.976 --> 22:39.275
60.

22:39.277 --> 22:42.447
So like gone as in dead?

22:47.552 --> 22:49.885
Wait, your change.

23:50.314 --> 23:51.547
There you are.

23:51.549 --> 23:53.685
We're gonna have
our first cheese lesson.

23:56.487 --> 23:59.288
Hey Jean, I just need like um,

23:59.290 --> 24:00.489
I just need like a moment,

24:00.491 --> 24:03.059
because I haven't really had
a shower in three days

24:03.061 --> 24:04.994
and I'm exhausted.

24:04.996 --> 24:06.495
And I just need a moment.

24:06.497 --> 24:07.496
- Alright.
- Okay.

24:07.498 --> 24:08.864
Go.

24:08.866 --> 24:09.699
Take your shower,

24:09.701 --> 24:12.435
I see you back here
in 10 minutes.

25:43.194 --> 25:45.027
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

25:45.029 --> 25:47.930
Oh, and thanks for the...
the overalls.

25:47.932 --> 25:49.598
And do they fit.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.066
You're starting
to look the part.

25:52.103 --> 25:53.402
Looks can be deceiving.

25:53.404 --> 25:56.071
- What are we doing?
- God's work.

25:56.073 --> 25:57.807
We're making chévre.

25:57.809 --> 25:59.175
Come on.

26:00.011 --> 26:01.811
- That sounds hard.
- It's not hard.

26:01.813 --> 26:05.781
Here, I want you to put
this milk into that pan.

26:05.783 --> 26:07.316
So here.

26:07.318 --> 26:08.285
It's heavy.

26:08.287 --> 26:09.385
Pour it all in.

26:09.387 --> 26:11.220
Yeah, that... that's good.

26:11.222 --> 26:13.856
Alright, now this is rennet
and bacteria.

26:13.858 --> 26:16.158
You're gonna put
two or three drops in there

26:16.160 --> 26:18.194
and I'm gonna put
this whole thing in there.

26:18.196 --> 26:20.229
And this is gonna help
the milk coagulate.

26:20.231 --> 26:21.530
My head feels coagulated.

26:21.532 --> 26:22.631
You stir that now.

26:22.633 --> 26:25.100
Stir that up.

26:25.102 --> 26:29.605
Um, hey Jean, I just...
listen, I just wanna

26:29.607 --> 26:32.708
thank you again
for letting us stay.

26:32.710 --> 26:34.610
I mean you know,
you've been so amazing.

26:34.612 --> 26:37.780
And the kids obviously
love it here and...

26:37.782 --> 26:39.481
You don't have to
thank me anymore.

26:39.483 --> 26:40.783
You work here now.

26:40.785 --> 26:42.585
Well, I just... that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

26:42.587 --> 26:46.289
I am not sure that
I'm actually cut out for this.

26:46.291 --> 26:47.156
You know?

26:47.158 --> 26:49.225
I want you to take
those around there

26:49.227 --> 26:51.360
and put 'em on this parchment
paper, nice and even.

26:51.362 --> 26:54.297
Come on, pick 'em up
with your bare hands, go ahead.

26:54.299 --> 26:55.598
- I...
- That's good, go ahead.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.733
Go ahead.

26:57.735 --> 26:59.368
You can go on, I'm listening.

26:59.370 --> 27:02.204
Well, I just... I don't know
how long we're gonna be here

27:02.206 --> 27:05.708
and I don't want you
to depend on me just in case,

27:05.710 --> 27:08.410
you know,
this all doesn't work out.

27:08.412 --> 27:11.247
And I... I really appreciate you.

27:11.249 --> 27:12.414
Okay, I understand.

27:12.416 --> 27:13.616
Okay?

27:13.618 --> 27:15.551
I'll take you
for as long as I can get you.

27:15.553 --> 27:16.719
There.

27:16.721 --> 27:18.321
It's alright, you can have
a little bit on your hands.

27:18.323 --> 27:20.656
Just salt 'em lightly now,
'cause it's all done.

27:20.658 --> 27:21.757
I'm gonna... it's a...

27:21.759 --> 27:23.192
Just take a teaspoon,
just like you're putting

27:23.194 --> 27:25.561
a little salt on your food
only you're not shaking it.

27:25.563 --> 27:27.162
- There you go.
- Okay.

27:27.164 --> 27:29.031
Yeah, you can do that,
pinch it on.

27:29.033 --> 27:30.165
You're a natural.

27:44.316 --> 27:47.952
Well, Bartley, sounds like
we have a full house.

27:50.588 --> 27:52.087
What do you have
in your backpack?

27:52.089 --> 27:54.890
Ooh, okay,
let's go, please hurry.

27:54.892 --> 27:57.159
Come on, Abby,
I don't wanna be late.

27:57.161 --> 27:58.328
Here you go.

27:58.330 --> 28:00.131
Okay.

28:04.802 --> 28:07.870
Bug,
you're doing such a good job.

28:07.872 --> 28:09.571
Isn't the milk glass pretty,
mama?

28:09.573 --> 28:11.006
It really is.

28:11.008 --> 28:12.409
You know what else is pretty?

28:12.411 --> 28:13.410
You.

28:14.912 --> 28:16.413
We're having company for dinner.

28:16.415 --> 28:17.347
We are?

28:17.349 --> 28:18.614
You better go get cleaned up.

28:18.616 --> 28:20.751
Yes, ma'am.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.788
Can you go get the bread?

28:27.392 --> 28:28.960
Don't you tear it up.

28:32.930 --> 28:34.264
Tank and I actually saw...

28:37.935 --> 28:39.668
Evenin', one and all.

28:39.670 --> 28:42.638
Oooh, it smells like
love in here, Jean.

28:46.477 --> 28:48.544
Libby,
this is my boyfriend Russ.

28:48.546 --> 28:50.112
Hi.

28:50.114 --> 28:51.448
Give me a hug, I wanna hug you.

28:51.450 --> 28:54.783
And this is his beautiful
granddaughter Sunshine.

28:54.785 --> 28:57.052
Hi, how's it going?

28:57.054 --> 28:57.886
Hi.

28:57.888 --> 29:00.089
These are for you.

29:00.091 --> 29:01.056
For me, why?

29:01.058 --> 29:03.393
Well, you're the niece
of the woman I love.

29:03.395 --> 29:04.394
It's a bribe.

29:04.396 --> 29:05.961
Don't listen to her.

29:05.963 --> 29:08.431
I need all the help I can get
with this one.

29:08.433 --> 29:10.232
I need you on my side.

29:10.234 --> 29:13.068
Now she is one of them
hippie Liberals

29:13.070 --> 29:14.903
and I'm a Conservative lawyer.

29:14.905 --> 29:16.439
Wait, I thought you owned
the feed store.

29:16.441 --> 29:19.241
Well, I'm also entrepreneur.

29:19.243 --> 29:22.111
Now just tell me you're not one
of them hippies or Liberals,

29:22.113 --> 29:23.078
are you?

29:23.080 --> 29:24.913
I'm not really sure what I am.

29:24.915 --> 29:26.949
She's undecided,
that means she's a Liberal.

29:26.951 --> 29:28.217
That's one for my side.

29:28.219 --> 29:29.718
What?

29:29.720 --> 29:31.787
Oh now, come on now,
that's not right.

29:31.789 --> 29:32.957
Sorry, Russ.

29:40.298 --> 29:42.131
Jean, how you feelin'?

29:42.133 --> 29:44.199
Well, my fingers are
a little swollen

29:44.201 --> 29:47.169
when I get up in the morning
these days, aching, you know...

29:47.171 --> 29:49.538
- No, no, no, Jean.
- Just things like that.

29:49.540 --> 29:52.777
I mean, how are you feeling?

29:54.279 --> 29:56.279
I don't know.

29:56.281 --> 30:00.517
Worried, hopeful.

30:00.519 --> 30:02.918
How am I supposed to feel?

30:02.920 --> 30:04.686
Well, you know
what I always say.

30:04.688 --> 30:06.688
Yes, I do.

30:06.690 --> 30:08.824
Then I guess
I don't have to say it.

30:08.826 --> 30:11.195
No, you don't.

30:16.801 --> 30:18.803
I feel like
maybe I should say it anyway.

30:20.272 --> 30:22.505
What are you gonna do?
Hands high.

30:22.507 --> 30:24.139
Ooh, solar plexus, nice.

30:24.141 --> 30:26.241
Follow it up with an elbow,
right.

30:26.243 --> 30:27.176
You.

30:27.178 --> 30:28.311
Whoa!

30:28.313 --> 30:29.379
Alright, Abby,

30:29.381 --> 30:31.448
if that kid messes with you,
you know what to do.

30:31.450 --> 30:32.714
Go to bed.

30:32.716 --> 30:33.882
Goodnight, O'Connor.

30:33.884 --> 30:35.050
- Goodnight, you guys.
- Goodnight, O'Connor.

30:35.052 --> 30:36.085
Where are you going?

30:36.087 --> 30:37.121
- Upstairs, mom.
- Okay.

30:40.392 --> 30:42.325
Yeah, dishes are clean.

30:44.496 --> 30:46.095
See what I mean?

30:46.097 --> 30:48.197
Thank you for nothing, Dooby.

30:48.199 --> 30:48.864
Man.

30:52.236 --> 30:53.235
That was nice.

30:53.237 --> 30:54.169
What?

30:54.171 --> 30:55.971
Just having a home-cooked meal.

30:55.973 --> 30:57.442
Yeah, I know what you mean.

31:03.747 --> 31:06.648
Hey.

31:06.650 --> 31:08.917
Um, I just wanted to say

31:08.919 --> 31:12.455
I'm really sorry for
freaking you out at the store.

31:12.457 --> 31:14.324
It's okay.

31:14.326 --> 31:15.427
Give me your hand.

31:18.229 --> 31:20.263
Yeah, you're probably freaking
her out again right now.

31:20.265 --> 31:22.365
Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

31:22.367 --> 31:24.066
I just... come on,
I'm gonna read it.

31:24.068 --> 31:25.535
- Okay.
- Oh, you don't have to, you...

31:25.537 --> 31:27.703
- Let me.
- Okay.

31:27.705 --> 31:29.805
Okay.

31:29.807 --> 31:32.774
So it says you have
a very strong life line.

31:32.776 --> 31:34.676
Ooh, that's original.

31:34.678 --> 31:36.579
Ignore him.

31:36.581 --> 31:41.650
Um, wow, and it says that
your past and your present

31:41.652 --> 31:43.218
are about to intersect.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.921
Your heart line says that
you have a lot of love

31:45.923 --> 31:51.927
in your life
and huh, two family rings.

31:51.929 --> 31:53.263
And what does that mean?

31:53.265 --> 31:56.198
It means you have two families.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.637
And everything in your life
is about to change.

32:01.772 --> 32:03.906
Newsflash,
I think it already has.

32:03.908 --> 32:06.141
Okay, with that revelation
I'm gonna...

32:06.143 --> 32:07.743
I'm gonna hit the hay.

32:07.745 --> 32:09.711
Uh, Jean, thank you for dinner.

32:09.713 --> 32:10.580
Goodnight, everybody.

32:10.582 --> 32:11.614
Goodnight, James.

32:11.616 --> 32:12.515
Goodnight.

32:12.517 --> 32:14.584
Goodnight.

32:16.153 --> 32:19.457
Your husband,
you said he was gone.

32:23.761 --> 32:25.430
But he's not really gone.

32:27.499 --> 32:31.867
Okay, actually now you are
freaking me out.

32:41.779 --> 32:43.180
Is he gonna get the day off?

32:49.153 --> 32:51.720
It's not a day
off if you're sick.

32:51.722 --> 32:52.888
I don't feel good.

32:52.890 --> 32:54.122
Good morning,
my beautiful family.

32:54.124 --> 32:54.957
Hey, babe...

32:54.959 --> 32:56.024
Is he gonna get the day off?

32:56.026 --> 32:57.293
Can you take Abby
to school today,

32:57.295 --> 32:59.228
I gotta take tank to the doctor,
he's burning up?

32:59.230 --> 33:00.663
Yeah, yeah, sorry to hear that,
buddy.

33:00.665 --> 33:02.298
Abby, I'm leaving
in five minutes, are you ready?

33:02.300 --> 33:03.198
Yes, sir.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.400
And you're going
to the bank today, right?

33:04.402 --> 33:06.068
- I'm gonna drop off Abby...
- I don't feel good.

33:06.070 --> 33:07.537
And then I'm gonna deal
with the new deal

33:07.539 --> 33:08.538
that I've been working on
and yes,

33:08.540 --> 33:09.472
I'm gonna go straight...

33:09.474 --> 33:10.306
Tuition's due.

33:10.308 --> 33:12.609
To the bank right after that.

33:12.611 --> 33:14.042
You worry too much.

33:14.044 --> 33:15.043
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:15.045 --> 33:16.845
Love you.

33:16.847 --> 33:19.081
Danny.

33:19.083 --> 33:20.782
Danny!
Something bad is gonna happen.

33:20.784 --> 33:21.917
I got it.

33:21.919 --> 33:23.386
Scout's honour.

33:23.388 --> 33:24.886
Stop worrying.

33:24.888 --> 33:27.055
I love you.

33:27.057 --> 33:29.559
- Danny.
- Serious question.

33:29.561 --> 33:31.628
Um, who do you like better,
me or mama?

33:31.630 --> 33:32.629
Danny!

33:32.631 --> 33:34.029
We won't get into that.

33:34.031 --> 33:35.431
Yeah, okay, come on.

33:35.433 --> 33:36.633
Danny!

33:36.635 --> 33:37.600
Danny!

33:37.602 --> 33:38.601
Danny!

33:38.603 --> 33:39.537
Danny!

34:32.056 --> 34:33.758
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

35:05.390 --> 35:09.124
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:10.628 --> 35:12.430
What?

35:15.600 --> 35:17.866
You want the bad news
or the bad news.

35:17.868 --> 35:19.901
The bad news.

35:19.903 --> 35:24.072
The latch is broken,
I was out here trying to fix it.

35:24.074 --> 35:25.675
Nobody's gonna be up
for the next five hours

35:25.677 --> 35:27.943
to open up this damn door.

35:27.945 --> 35:28.778
What?
Get...

35:29.514 --> 35:31.449
Five hours.

35:39.257 --> 35:41.022
- It's stuck.
- Yeah.

35:43.127 --> 35:44.560
Why don't you call Jean
on her cellphone?

35:44.562 --> 35:46.928
Uh, my cellphone's
right outside the door.

35:46.930 --> 35:47.864
You got your cellphone on you?

35:47.866 --> 35:48.865
No, I don't have my cellphone.

35:48.867 --> 35:50.232
Of course, you don't.

35:50.234 --> 35:51.267
What's the other bad news?

35:51.269 --> 35:54.537
It's about to get real cold
in here.

35:54.539 --> 35:56.372
What if we scream,
maybe she can hear us?

35:56.374 --> 35:58.374
It's a refrigerator,
it's insulated, no, y...

35:58.376 --> 36:01.143
I mean you can go ahead and try.

36:01.145 --> 36:03.279
Don't you have some wire
or maybe a screwdriver

36:03.281 --> 36:05.281
and then maybe you could just
jam it open or something?

36:05.283 --> 36:06.783
- Or just...
- Oh, that's a good idea.

36:06.785 --> 36:08.317
I...

36:08.319 --> 36:12.455
A stick of gum, a nail file,
a sock, and in 45 seconds,

36:12.457 --> 36:14.891
I can have the door open
before the bomb goes off.

36:14.893 --> 36:16.226
Thank you.

36:17.896 --> 36:19.564
That'll keep you warm.

36:29.441 --> 36:30.907
What did I tell you about doors
and gates?

36:30.909 --> 36:31.973
I don't need a lecture
right now.

36:31.975 --> 36:33.041
Leave 'em the way
you found 'em.

36:33.043 --> 36:33.810
I don't need a lecture!

36:33.812 --> 36:34.943
Leave 'em the way you found 'em.

36:34.945 --> 36:35.778
Ow!

36:35.780 --> 36:36.813
If a door's open,
you leave it open.

36:36.815 --> 36:38.416
If a door is closed,
you leave it closed.

36:41.985 --> 36:46.087
Patsy Cline had a great January.

36:46.089 --> 36:47.759
You should try that.

36:54.399 --> 36:55.565
That's really good.

36:55.567 --> 36:56.501
Hmm.

37:00.438 --> 37:03.439
What if I have to pee?

37:03.441 --> 37:06.141
Oh, you...
you're not peeing here.

37:06.143 --> 37:07.677
You're gonna have to hold it in.

37:07.679 --> 37:09.077
What if I can't?

37:09.079 --> 37:12.281
What are we in preschool?

37:12.283 --> 37:16.619
You're gonna have...
you're gonna have to hold it.

37:16.621 --> 37:18.119
I mean,
you gotta go pee right now?

37:18.121 --> 37:19.322
No.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.223
Then why... why are we even
talking about it?

37:21.225 --> 37:25.093
Because I'm worried that
I might have to go later.

37:38.543 --> 37:40.309
So why'd you move out here
anyway?

37:40.311 --> 37:42.879
I had to get out
of my mom's place.

37:42.881 --> 37:43.946
Yeah?

37:43.948 --> 37:47.650
Yeah, my husband died
and then I lost our house.

37:47.652 --> 37:49.452
So it was a pretty great year.

37:49.454 --> 37:52.288
And uh, then I had to move in
with my mom.

37:52.290 --> 37:53.789
And Marsha's not easy.

37:55.293 --> 37:57.360
Why do you live here?

37:57.362 --> 38:00.730
Uh, convenience mostly.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.669
My ex got the house.

38:06.671 --> 38:07.937
Your ex-wife?

38:07.939 --> 38:10.205
No, ex-husband.

38:10.207 --> 38:11.874
Shut up.

38:11.876 --> 38:12.875
Really?

38:12.877 --> 38:14.042
No ex-wife.

38:14.044 --> 38:17.212
Oh.

38:17.214 --> 38:19.482
How long you guys been divorced?

38:19.484 --> 38:20.983
You know, I'd... I'd...
I'd actually prefer

38:20.985 --> 38:22.385
to talk about Marsha.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.085
Marsha.

38:24.087 --> 38:25.988
She's very beautiful.

38:25.990 --> 38:28.524
She still is very beautiful.

38:28.526 --> 38:31.494
Travel agent,
been married four times.

38:31.496 --> 38:32.795
She's a piece of work.

38:32.797 --> 38:36.064
I think I was like 6
when she'd decided

38:36.066 --> 38:38.734
I didn't need a babysitter
anymore.

38:38.736 --> 38:41.003
I remember I was so scared
whenever she would leave me.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.841
I would... I would stay
in my closet with the um,

38:45.843 --> 38:47.777
you know the high horses.

38:47.779 --> 38:50.145
You know, those like sticks
with the little horse heads

38:50.147 --> 38:51.146
on top.

38:51.148 --> 38:53.282
I would sit in my closet
with that.

38:53.284 --> 38:54.784
And sometimes,
I would wake up there,

38:54.786 --> 38:58.387
'cause I think she just forgot
to come check on me.

38:58.389 --> 39:00.056
Well, that sucks.

39:00.058 --> 39:03.259
Yeah, but no, not that bad.

39:06.196 --> 39:08.299
Hey, come sit.

39:17.041 --> 39:18.443
Lean back against that.

39:22.013 --> 39:23.045
Thanks.

39:23.047 --> 39:23.982
Yeah.

39:25.148 --> 39:26.147
Oh God.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.418
Oh, this stinks.

40:13.865 --> 40:16.966
Y'all have a little
cold weather campout?

40:19.003 --> 40:20.036
Oh God, oh.

40:20.872 --> 40:21.937
Thank you!

40:21.939 --> 40:22.838
Oh God!

40:22.840 --> 40:24.073
It was so cold.

40:24.075 --> 40:25.240
Wooh!

40:25.242 --> 40:27.242
This one got us locked in.

40:27.244 --> 40:30.579
Who fixes a door
in the middle of night?

40:30.581 --> 40:32.615
The one, who knows how to get
a job done, that's who.

40:32.617 --> 40:35.183
Well, this one's got an answer
for everything, doesn't he?

40:35.185 --> 40:36.519
Ooh.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.355
Like you got an answer
for everything, too.

40:51.069 --> 40:51.967
See you tomorrow.

40:51.969 --> 40:54.138
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:59.911 --> 41:03.145
Where did you get
that funny shirt, new girl.

41:03.147 --> 41:07.149
You're so ugly you'd scare
a buzzard off a gut cart.

41:07.151 --> 41:09.787
What are you gonna do, limper?

41:16.294 --> 41:17.893
- Mrs. Moran?
- Yes.

41:17.895 --> 41:18.963
Hi.

41:22.867 --> 41:24.400
Are you sure
it was Abby's fault,

41:24.402 --> 41:26.035
because she's really...
she's not a fighter.

41:26.037 --> 41:27.470
She's never even hit anybody
in her life.

41:27.472 --> 41:28.671
- I mean...
- Well, it's never easy

41:28.673 --> 41:30.706
starting at a new school.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.341
But we have
a zero tolerance policy

41:32.343 --> 41:34.242
for violence here.

41:34.244 --> 41:36.479
Abby will have to use her words
instead of her karate chops

41:36.481 --> 41:37.947
when she's teased.

41:37.949 --> 41:39.949
Teased about what?

41:39.951 --> 41:42.685
Mrs. Moran, Abby's not the first
and she certainly

41:42.687 --> 41:44.520
won't be the last gawky child.

41:44.522 --> 41:47.790
She... she has a limp
from a car accident.

41:47.792 --> 41:49.825
It's the same car accident
that killed her father

41:49.827 --> 41:51.861
and my daughter knows more
about pain and hard work...

41:51.863 --> 41:53.796
Mrs. Moran.

41:53.798 --> 41:55.831
This isn't a great way
to start a new school.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.835
It's grounds for suspension.

41:59.604 --> 42:00.736
What is going on?

42:00.738 --> 42:05.007
I mean what...
this is not like you.

42:05.009 --> 42:06.075
He called me "limper".

42:06.077 --> 42:09.044
Okay, that kid is a jerk,

42:09.046 --> 42:11.680
but you cannot just go around
hitting people.

42:11.682 --> 42:14.450
You have to use your words,
okay?

42:15.820 --> 42:18.521
I mean how do you even know
karate in the first place?

42:18.523 --> 42:20.523
O'Connor.

42:20.525 --> 42:21.192
What?

42:34.038 --> 42:35.037
It's Libby.

42:35.039 --> 42:36.007
Mom.

42:38.743 --> 42:39.909
Hey, oh hey, Abby.

42:39.911 --> 42:43.879
Um, did you teach her
how to fight?

42:43.881 --> 42:45.714
- Yeah, a couple of moves.
- Well, thank you,

42:45.716 --> 42:47.783
because my child just got
suspended for a week.

42:47.785 --> 42:49.652
You finally got that Jimmy kid.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.187
I got him right
in the solar plexus.

42:51.189 --> 42:52.521
Nice work.

42:52.523 --> 42:54.490
No.

42:54.492 --> 42:56.826
No, not nice work.

42:56.828 --> 42:59.128
How does he know about Jimmy?

42:59.130 --> 43:01.096
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm your mother.

43:01.098 --> 43:02.698
Because I knew you would
stress out about it.

43:02.700 --> 43:03.899
What, I'm not stressed out!

43:03.901 --> 43:05.601
Mom, you're stressing out
right now.

43:05.603 --> 43:08.771
Abby, I'm fine,
I can handle this, I'm cool.

43:08.773 --> 43:10.241
You could've told me.

43:13.511 --> 43:14.910
I need you to go to your room.

43:14.912 --> 43:16.378
- Go to your room.
- Yeah.

43:16.380 --> 43:17.479
Don't...

43:17.481 --> 43:18.547
- Go to your room.
- Don't...

43:18.549 --> 43:22.252
Don't ever do that again.

43:22.254 --> 43:24.220
- Why are you mad at her?
- I'm not mad at her.

43:24.222 --> 43:25.421
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

43:25.423 --> 43:26.488
She's been getting picked on
ever since

43:26.490 --> 43:27.423
she got to that school.

43:27.425 --> 43:29.925
I'm mad at you.

43:29.927 --> 43:34.396
She didn't tell you, because
she's trying to protect you.

43:34.398 --> 43:36.033
What?
Protect me from what?

43:39.103 --> 43:41.606
I hope she kicked the piss
out of him.

44:15.274 --> 44:17.208
Hey.

44:18.910 --> 44:21.076
You know what that kid said,
it was awful

44:21.078 --> 44:24.179
and he probably got
what he deserved.

44:24.181 --> 44:29.551
And I am so proud of you
for standing up for yourself.

44:29.553 --> 44:32.054
I miss daddy.

44:32.056 --> 44:33.624
Look, I know.

44:36.661 --> 44:37.828
I know.

44:40.431 --> 44:41.699
I do, too.

44:45.436 --> 44:48.837
I like it here on the farm.

44:48.839 --> 44:50.572
Are we gonna stay, mama?

44:50.574 --> 44:52.708
I don't know.

44:52.710 --> 44:57.212
You know what I do know that
whatever happens,

44:57.214 --> 44:59.351
we're gonna be okay.

45:01.386 --> 45:02.419
Promise?

45:02.421 --> 45:04.421
Oh.

45:04.423 --> 45:06.021
Promise.

45:11.562 --> 45:14.333
- Can I spend the night?
- Yeah.

45:19.603 --> 45:21.236
My feet are so cold.

45:41.293 --> 45:44.994

- Is that too much salt?
- Ready, just roll it.

46:58.235 --> 46:59.768
Yeah,
just put a little bit of salt.

46:59.770 --> 47:01.036
- Okay.
- That one looks really good.

47:01.038 --> 47:03.105
This costs $8,
this is handmade, too.

47:03.107 --> 47:04.773
- $8!
- It's handmade, too.

47:04.775 --> 47:06.342
We can sell it to the shop or...

47:06.344 --> 47:08.877
Well,
he can't afford this cheese.

47:18.689 --> 47:20.356
Now higher.

47:32.404 --> 47:34.471
"...a long white apron.

47:34.473 --> 47:37.307
And he informed her indeed
and precisely

47:37.309 --> 47:39.875
that he had prepared
cu... curry..."

47:39.877 --> 47:42.010
- Ooh.
- How do you say that word?

47:42.012 --> 47:43.513
- Curry.
- Curry.

47:43.515 --> 47:44.646
Curry shrimp.

47:44.648 --> 47:46.249
It's too spicy.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.400
Okay.

48:38.836 --> 48:40.202
What are we plantin'?

48:40.204 --> 48:44.206
Nothing aspirational,
only what we can eat.

48:44.208 --> 48:46.942
I'm not gonna plant another bed
of artichokes

48:46.944 --> 48:48.844
for no good reason.

48:54.952 --> 48:57.853
It really is pretty here.

48:57.855 --> 48:59.324
I thought you'd like it.

49:05.896 --> 49:08.697
Hey Jean,
can I ask you a question?

49:08.699 --> 49:11.700
Sure.

49:11.702 --> 49:13.570
How long did it take you?

49:13.572 --> 49:14.504
Plant all these?

49:14.506 --> 49:17.041
- Not long.
- Mm-mm, you know, to um...

49:20.679 --> 49:23.879
To...
to get over Frank?

49:27.552 --> 49:31.153
Initially, I was never gonna
get over Frank.

49:31.155 --> 49:33.323
I hunkered down in my sadness

49:33.325 --> 49:35.560
and I refused to come up
for air.

49:37.429 --> 49:41.666
Then slowly,
I got back to living.

49:43.167 --> 49:48.338
Life keeps chugging along
whether we like it or not.

49:48.340 --> 49:55.645
Sometimes, I just feel like
I'm drowning, you know?

49:55.647 --> 50:02.217
This kinda pain and loss,
it cracks you open.

50:02.219 --> 50:06.556
But we are made of magic
and resilience, Libby.

50:06.558 --> 50:09.259
Losing someone you love,

50:09.261 --> 50:11.563
that scar
will feel ugly forever.

50:13.531 --> 50:14.965
But it will heal.

50:19.870 --> 50:22.137
You promise?

50:22.139 --> 50:24.072
I can speak from experience.

50:34.218 --> 50:36.020
Is that too close?

50:56.574 --> 50:59.041
Farmer's market is
easy, I don't...

50:59.043 --> 51:01.344
I don't know why Jean waited
so long to show you.

51:01.346 --> 51:02.545
I do.

51:02.547 --> 51:06.915
I used to live in Houston,
haven't been back since we left.

51:06.917 --> 51:08.850
You moving back?

51:08.852 --> 51:09.951
I don't know.

51:09.953 --> 51:11.754
I have to get a real job,
I can't run a farm,

51:11.756 --> 51:13.389
I've gotta make money.

51:13.391 --> 51:14.856
Excuse me.

51:14.858 --> 51:16.559
Milking goats, isn't a real job?

51:16.561 --> 51:18.827
You know what I mean,
I gotta send my kids to college.

51:18.829 --> 51:20.396
College isn't necessary.

51:20.398 --> 51:21.897
My kids are going to college.

51:21.899 --> 51:23.433
Why?

51:23.435 --> 51:25.000
So they can have a good life.

51:25.002 --> 51:27.903
- To...
- Okay.

51:27.905 --> 51:29.772
- Did you go to college?
- Yep.

51:29.774 --> 51:30.939
Do you have a good life?

51:30.941 --> 51:34.876
Not because I went to college.

51:34.878 --> 51:36.346
- Did you go to college?
- Yes.

51:36.348 --> 51:38.283
Yeah,
and how is that working out for you?

51:40.918 --> 51:42.117
Okay, well, my life
didn't turn out

51:42.119 --> 51:43.553
exactly the way
it was supposed to.

51:43.555 --> 51:45.087
Well, that's true
for pretty much everyone, Libby.

51:45.089 --> 51:46.922
So you're just against
higher education?

51:46.924 --> 51:48.125
Yeah, it's a racket.

51:49.594 --> 51:51.294
The world is falling apart
anyway.

51:51.296 --> 51:53.329
Look, what you should be showing
your kids how to do

51:53.331 --> 51:56.432
is hotwire a car, how to hunt,
how to fish,

51:56.434 --> 51:58.133
how to fend for themselves.

51:58.135 --> 52:01.169
That, that is what's gonna
come in handy

52:01.171 --> 52:02.904
when the apocalypse comes.

52:02.906 --> 52:04.275
You realize you sound crazy?

52:05.943 --> 52:07.209
Maybe I am crazy.

52:07.211 --> 52:08.378
Yeah.

52:08.380 --> 52:11.146
Tank and Abby are gonna be
just fine,

52:11.148 --> 52:14.149
they're both survivors.

52:53.725 --> 52:56.559
One Doris and
two Angelina Jolies please.

52:56.561 --> 52:58.226
Good choice.

52:58.228 --> 53:00.696
My son loves Angelina Jolie,
too.

53:00.698 --> 53:02.765
She just has a way with kids
all over the world.

53:03.635 --> 53:04.634
Get it?

53:04.636 --> 53:05.568
Okay.

53:06.504 --> 53:09.237
Stop it, Libby,
it's not so funny.

53:09.239 --> 53:11.541
Oh my God.

53:11.543 --> 53:12.775
Libby Moran?

53:12.777 --> 53:14.444
Girls, it's Libby.

53:14.446 --> 53:16.779
Oh my gosh.

53:16.781 --> 53:17.814
Hi!

53:17.816 --> 53:18.748
It's Libby!

53:18.750 --> 53:19.782
Hi.

53:19.784 --> 53:20.783
Huh, look at you.

53:21.719 --> 53:22.951
L... Libby.

53:22.953 --> 53:24.720
Hi.

53:24.722 --> 53:26.689
Oh my God, we haven't seen you
since the funeral.

53:26.691 --> 53:28.990
- Yeah.
- Oh, I miss Danny so much.

53:28.992 --> 53:30.827
How are you really?

53:30.829 --> 53:32.595
How are you?

53:32.597 --> 53:33.563
I'm... I'm good.

53:33.565 --> 53:35.465
I'm... I'm... you know, the kids
are really...

53:35.467 --> 53:37.567
- Are you making cheese?
- Oh.

53:37.569 --> 53:39.569
Um, helping out.

53:39.571 --> 53:41.169
- And just selling.
- We buy it every week.

53:41.171 --> 53:42.204
Yeah, no, that is so cute.

53:42.206 --> 53:43.339
- Adorable.
- We love it.

53:43.341 --> 53:47.844
Ooh um, oh well, um,
I'll take a... a Rosie

53:47.846 --> 53:50.646
and um a... a Doris.

53:50.648 --> 53:51.681
Okay.

53:51.683 --> 53:55.116
Um, Rosie, Doris.

53:55.118 --> 53:58.254
Okay, okay, that is $10.

53:58.256 --> 53:59.789
You can keep the change.

53:59.791 --> 54:01.290
Oh no, we don't take tips.

54:01.292 --> 54:03.326
Oh well, yeah, actually...
speak for yourself.

54:03.328 --> 54:05.695
We do actually take tips.

54:05.697 --> 54:07.697
I guess we take tips.

54:08.600 --> 54:10.399
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go grab
a cider.

54:10.401 --> 54:12.668
Guess we take tips.

54:12.670 --> 54:15.738
Okay, you work
with the hot farmer?

54:15.740 --> 54:17.440
Who?

54:17.442 --> 54:18.841
Oh, that's what we call him.

54:18.843 --> 54:21.176
Him?

54:21.178 --> 54:22.345
He's the reason we come here.

54:22.347 --> 54:24.112
Mhmm, he's hot.

54:24.114 --> 54:25.481
Ridiculously hot.

54:25.483 --> 54:26.214
Wooh.

54:26.216 --> 54:27.316
Yeah.

54:27.318 --> 54:28.417
Yeah, he's yeah.

54:28.419 --> 54:29.952
Okay, wait a minute.

54:29.954 --> 54:34.290
Are you two... are you two
making cheese together?

54:34.292 --> 54:39.462
- No.
- I mean, what?

54:39.464 --> 54:40.363
- Are you?
- No.

54:40.365 --> 54:41.430
- Come on.
- Oh God.

54:41.432 --> 54:42.798
You can tell us.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.834
- I don't want to kiss and tell.
- You can tell us.

54:44.836 --> 54:46.435
I mean,
we've made some cheese together.

54:46.437 --> 54:48.337
- Oh!
- Sometimes.

54:48.339 --> 54:49.472
- Wow!
- Wow.

54:49.474 --> 54:51.239
- Well, good for you.
- Yeah.

54:51.241 --> 54:53.342
You've totally moved on.

54:53.344 --> 54:55.645
Oh, wasn't Danny
the sweetest guy ever though?

54:55.647 --> 54:57.346
- Hmm, just exquisite.
- Miss you, miss you.

54:57.348 --> 55:00.616
Ugh, a diamond in the rough.

55:01.653 --> 55:04.787
I... can you just give me a...

55:04.789 --> 55:06.856
Hey, I'll be right back.

55:06.858 --> 55:07.757
Thank you for sharing.

55:09.126 --> 55:11.126
Hi.

55:11.128 --> 55:12.295
Bye.

55:12.297 --> 55:13.896
Bye.
Go.

55:13.898 --> 55:14.997
See ya next week.

55:14.999 --> 55:16.532
Yeah.

55:27.278 --> 55:29.045
Hey, that was so sad.

55:29.047 --> 55:32.682
Ugh, what is it about her
that is so irritating?

55:32.684 --> 55:34.584
She's just one of those
people, mhmm, mhmm.

55:34.586 --> 55:36.752
Hey y'all,
you know I feel sorry for her.

55:36.754 --> 55:38.254
Her husband dies
in a car accident,

55:38.256 --> 55:39.655
- leaves them broke.
- Hmm.

55:39.657 --> 55:41.390
I went to her estate sale.

55:41.392 --> 55:42.391
Come on, you didn't.

55:42.393 --> 55:43.593
- I sure did.
- Oh.

55:43.595 --> 55:45.494
She had the same
wedding china as me.

55:45.496 --> 55:48.998
Y'all, don't judge, but I bought
every last piece of it.

55:50.068 --> 55:51.867
Now I have plate settings
for 24.

55:51.869 --> 55:52.568
That's amazing.

55:52.570 --> 55:53.703
Good thing I'm popular.

55:54.706 --> 55:56.439
Okay,
there's no way she's sleeping

55:56.441 --> 55:57.640
with the hot farmer.

55:57.642 --> 55:58.608
You don't think she's lying?

55:58.610 --> 55:59.609
Oh, give me a break.

55:59.611 --> 56:00.576
Hello, she looks like
she's wearing

56:00.578 --> 56:01.477
a Halloween costume.

56:01.479 --> 56:03.079
She's like a lumberjack.

56:03.081 --> 56:04.814
It's... from a truck stop.

56:06.985 --> 56:08.384
Do y'all think I need botox?

56:08.386 --> 56:09.452
- Oh.
- What?

56:09.454 --> 56:10.686
- That here.
- You look beautiful, no.

56:10.688 --> 56:12.421
No, you still look so young
from the last time.

56:12.423 --> 56:13.723
- Yeah, mhmm.
- Thank you.

56:13.725 --> 56:15.658
- Let's go.
- I love it, I'm way behind.

56:15.660 --> 56:16.594
Oh.

56:37.247 --> 56:38.347
Yeah, alright.

56:38.349 --> 56:41.350
Thank you.
Yeah, see you next week.

56:41.352 --> 56:43.252
Hey, we need to leave.

56:43.254 --> 56:44.320
- What?
- I need to leave.

56:44.322 --> 56:45.287
I need to leave.

56:45.289 --> 56:46.355
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
slow down.

56:46.357 --> 56:48.357
- What's... what's going on?
- We need to go.

56:48.359 --> 56:50.292
Those women that were here,
they hate me.

56:50.294 --> 56:51.293
They think you're hot.

56:51.295 --> 56:52.628
I might have accidentally
told them that

56:52.630 --> 56:54.096
we were making cheese together.

56:54.098 --> 56:56.732
And... and... and they're just
they're terrible people

56:56.734 --> 56:58.834
and I just really wanna go home
and they think I'm dressed like

56:58.836 --> 57:00.269
a scarecrow, so...

57:14.519 --> 57:16.988
I hate terrible people.

57:19.323 --> 57:20.723
Well, that's that.

57:20.725 --> 57:21.590
Mhmm.

57:21.592 --> 57:23.191
Well, that was gross.

57:23.193 --> 57:24.093
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

57:24.095 --> 57:25.029
Yeah.

57:29.634 --> 57:30.599
Yeah, I really do.

57:30.601 --> 57:32.334
You are to,
you're doing pretty good.

57:33.438 --> 57:36.839
I like it.

57:36.841 --> 57:39.041
Hello.

57:40.044 --> 57:41.846
When?

57:43.681 --> 57:45.347
Alright, I'm on my way.

57:45.349 --> 57:47.249
I'm on my way right now.

57:47.251 --> 57:48.216
Okay.

57:48.218 --> 57:49.952
What?

57:49.954 --> 57:51.487
It's Aaron.

57:51.489 --> 57:52.488
I'm sorry, I gotta...

57:52.490 --> 57:54.390
- Oh.
- I gotta go.

57:54.392 --> 57:56.394
It's okay, go, I got this.

58:12.210 --> 58:13.542
- I like yours.
- I like yours.

58:13.544 --> 58:14.744
- I like yours.
- I like yours.

58:14.746 --> 58:15.644
I like yours.

58:15.646 --> 58:16.512
You know we can switch off,
remember...

58:16.514 --> 58:17.413
Yeah, we can switch 'em off.

58:17.415 --> 58:18.981
You guys look...

58:18.983 --> 58:19.715
Hi, mama.

58:19.717 --> 58:21.117
Mama, we made hats.

58:21.119 --> 58:22.118
Oh my gosh!

58:22.120 --> 58:24.587
The tinfoil makes
our brain waves move faster.

58:24.589 --> 58:27.022
Well, who doesn't want that.

58:27.024 --> 58:28.390
Look at you.

58:28.392 --> 58:29.859
Are you guys done?

58:29.861 --> 58:31.594
Okay, why don't you go upstairs,
wash up,

58:31.596 --> 58:33.696
brush those dirty chompers.

58:33.698 --> 58:34.864
What do you have on your nose?

58:36.067 --> 58:37.433
And um,
I'll come up and I'll read you a story.

58:37.435 --> 58:38.200
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

58:38.202 --> 58:39.835
Great.

58:39.837 --> 58:41.105
Go!

58:42.240 --> 58:43.305
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

58:43.307 --> 58:44.106
Goodnight, Aunt Jean.

58:45.009 --> 58:46.944
Goodnight.

58:48.212 --> 58:49.145
Ain't he sweet?

58:49.147 --> 58:51.947
He's cute.

58:53.851 --> 58:55.417
How was the market?

58:55.419 --> 58:58.821
Um, better than expected.

58:58.823 --> 59:01.323
O'Connor had to um,
just run off.

59:01.325 --> 59:03.025
Uh, something happened
with Aaron.

59:03.027 --> 59:04.627
Oh goodness.

59:04.629 --> 59:06.462
I'll have to call
and check on him.

59:06.464 --> 59:07.563
Who's Aaron?

59:07.565 --> 59:08.764
His ex-wife.

59:08.766 --> 59:10.267
She had a stroke
some years back.

59:10.269 --> 59:11.200
How old is she?

59:11.202 --> 59:13.169
Same age as him.

59:13.171 --> 59:16.305
A nurse takes care of her,
but he's out there all the time.

59:16.307 --> 59:18.340
That sucks.

59:20.611 --> 59:22.478
Who could that be?

59:22.480 --> 59:23.879
I don't know anybody who knocks.

59:23.881 --> 59:25.314
Nobody knocks in that order.

59:25.316 --> 59:26.651
No.

59:33.457 --> 59:35.591
Looks like they released
the Kraken.

59:39.864 --> 59:42.200
I'm here to see my daughter
and my grandchildren.

59:54.512 --> 59:56.545
What are you doing here?

59:56.547 --> 1:00:02.351
Um, well, uh, making cheese.

1:00:02.353 --> 1:00:04.153
Um, goat cheese,
and then...

1:00:04.155 --> 1:00:08.424
No, honey,
I mean what are you doing?

1:00:08.426 --> 1:00:09.861
What are you doing here?

1:00:13.464 --> 1:00:16.266
You can come home now, you can.

1:00:16.268 --> 1:00:18.367
I forgive you.

1:00:18.369 --> 1:00:19.635
Forgive me for what?

1:00:19.637 --> 1:00:20.936
For leaving.

1:00:20.938 --> 1:00:25.107
Well, you made it pretty clear
that um, we were nearing

1:00:25.109 --> 1:00:26.876
our expiration date.

1:00:26.878 --> 1:00:29.378
You'd been sleeping on my couch
for six months.

1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:30.579
I was having a hard time.

1:00:30.581 --> 1:00:33.616
I know, and I was trying
to motivate you,

1:00:33.618 --> 1:00:36.452
because I did not raise you
to be a victim.

1:00:36.454 --> 1:00:38.387
You cannot throw your life away
if he was not worth it...

1:00:38.389 --> 1:00:41.857
Marsha!

1:00:41.859 --> 1:00:46.296
These kids have to go to bed,
so we need to say goodnight to...

1:00:46.298 --> 1:00:47.463
- What?
- I didn't even...

1:00:47.465 --> 1:00:48.497
Goodnight, Marsha.

1:00:48.499 --> 1:00:50.165
Goodnight.

1:00:50.167 --> 1:00:51.567
Goodnight, my babies.

1:00:51.569 --> 1:00:52.668
Hey, Abigail.

1:00:53.871 --> 1:00:55.938
Yep, you got taller.

1:00:55.940 --> 1:00:57.139
I see it.

1:00:57.141 --> 1:00:58.807
That's good, honey.

1:00:58.809 --> 1:01:00.843
So stand up straight.

1:01:00.845 --> 1:01:02.578
Come on, let's see it.

1:01:02.580 --> 1:01:03.881
That's right.

1:01:13.392 --> 1:01:16.959
I really... I can't believe that
you're being so ungrateful.

1:01:16.961 --> 1:01:19.495
I'd given you everything.

1:01:19.497 --> 1:01:22.164
I gave you an education.

1:01:22.166 --> 1:01:24.667
I gave you
all those really nice clothes,

1:01:24.669 --> 1:01:26.735
took you on
all those great vacations.

1:01:26.737 --> 1:01:30.506
Mama, let's...
you left me hotel rooms, so...

1:01:30.508 --> 1:01:31.907
They were very nice hotels.

1:01:31.909 --> 1:01:33.976
Yeah, okay.

1:01:33.978 --> 1:01:36.578
Okay.

1:01:36.580 --> 1:01:39.014
I just... I...

1:01:40.785 --> 1:01:44.086
You don't want this.

1:01:44.088 --> 1:01:46.655
I'm staying here for now, okay?

1:01:46.657 --> 1:01:47.756
Why?

1:01:47.758 --> 1:01:50.393
This is not you, Libby.

1:01:50.395 --> 1:01:51.560
This isn't you.

1:01:51.562 --> 1:01:53.263
What's me?

1:01:53.265 --> 1:01:54.563
Tell me, what is me.

1:01:54.565 --> 1:01:55.864
You're not meant
for a small town,

1:01:55.866 --> 1:01:59.034
you're not meant for a farm,
this...

1:01:59.036 --> 1:02:00.235
Mama, what am I meant for?

1:02:00.237 --> 1:02:01.904
'Cause I don't know
what I'm meant for.

1:02:01.906 --> 1:02:05.741
Well, we can find out
when you come home.

1:02:05.743 --> 1:02:07.876
I don't have a home!

1:02:07.878 --> 1:02:10.380
I don't have a home!

1:02:10.382 --> 1:02:11.714
Where do I go?

1:02:11.716 --> 1:02:14.351
This is all I've got,
so I'm gonna stay here.

1:02:14.353 --> 1:02:15.318
Okay?

1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:16.218
This is all I got.

1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:17.953
You can come back to me.

1:02:17.955 --> 1:02:20.222
We'll find something bigger.

1:02:20.224 --> 1:02:21.824
I really don't wanna do this
right now.

1:02:21.826 --> 1:02:24.960
I gotta get the kids to bed.

1:02:24.962 --> 1:02:25.961
Fine.

1:02:25.963 --> 1:02:27.330
Alright.

1:02:27.332 --> 1:02:28.163
Just give up.

1:02:28.165 --> 1:02:29.798
Mama,
I cannot do this right now.

1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:30.833
No.

1:02:30.835 --> 1:02:32.169
You... you get to choose the time
when you do this.

1:02:32.471 --> 1:02:33.902
Okay, you know what,
thank you so much

1:02:33.904 --> 1:02:35.472
for letting us stay
at your house.

1:02:35.474 --> 1:02:36.339
Is that okay?

1:02:36.341 --> 1:02:37.673
Thank you so much

1:02:37.675 --> 1:02:39.409
and I hope you have
a safe drive back home.

1:02:39.411 --> 1:02:40.276
Does that sound good?

1:02:40.278 --> 1:02:41.710
There you go.

1:02:41.712 --> 1:02:43.382
Libby?

1:02:52.590 --> 1:02:53.591
Stupid.

1:02:57.962 --> 1:03:00.062
You look tired, Jean.

1:03:00.064 --> 1:03:02.531
I was just gonna say
the same thing about you.

1:03:02.533 --> 1:03:03.868
Hmm.

1:03:11.675 --> 1:03:13.876
I know you're trying to turn her
against me.

1:03:13.878 --> 1:03:15.445
Did you tell her yet?

1:03:15.447 --> 1:03:18.047
Not yet.

1:03:18.049 --> 1:03:19.449
She's gonna be just
as disappointed in you

1:03:19.451 --> 1:03:21.216
as she is in me.

1:03:21.218 --> 1:03:22.217
Maybe.

1:03:22.219 --> 1:03:25.156
Well, I know her
and she's gonna come back to me.

1:03:30.362 --> 1:03:32.295
God, I hate this place.

1:03:32.297 --> 1:03:33.595
S...

1:03:33.597 --> 1:03:35.465
These people.

1:03:35.467 --> 1:03:37.833
It's all so small.

1:03:37.835 --> 1:03:41.036
Lucky for us,
you don't live here anymore.

1:03:41.038 --> 1:03:42.173
Yeah.

1:03:45.277 --> 1:03:47.544
Why do you even live here
when you could be living

1:03:47.546 --> 1:03:48.644
up there?

1:03:48.646 --> 1:03:50.346
I'll never live
in that house again.

1:03:50.348 --> 1:03:52.350
'Cause you're stubborn,
just like Papa.

1:03:58.923 --> 1:04:00.622
You've always been jealous
of me.

1:04:00.624 --> 1:04:03.295
I never even think about you.

1:04:34.024 --> 1:04:35.425
Good girl, come on.

1:04:35.427 --> 1:04:36.394
Let's go, come on.

1:04:48.473 --> 1:04:51.006
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:04:51.008 --> 1:04:54.643
Hey uh, I'm sorry
I guess I'm the new O'Connor.

1:04:54.645 --> 1:04:56.011
Oh!

1:04:56.013 --> 1:04:59.249
Yeah, uh, Jean asked me to come
help out with uh...

1:04:59.251 --> 1:05:01.783
Have you ever done
any of this before?

1:05:01.785 --> 1:05:03.620
How hard could it be?

1:05:05.423 --> 1:05:06.422
Nice shoes.

1:05:06.424 --> 1:05:07.823
Oh, thanks.

1:05:07.825 --> 1:05:08.757
They're new.

1:05:08.759 --> 1:05:09.825
Yeah.

1:05:09.827 --> 1:05:11.561
Not for long.

1:05:11.563 --> 1:05:13.128
Um, grab that feed.

1:05:13.130 --> 1:05:15.565
Okay.

1:05:15.567 --> 1:05:16.468
Hurry up.

1:05:20.472 --> 1:05:22.905
The one with the long ears,
what are they?

1:05:22.907 --> 1:05:24.139
Nubians.

1:05:24.141 --> 1:05:25.475
Yes.

1:05:25.477 --> 1:05:27.709
And that one over there
with the short ears?

1:05:27.711 --> 1:05:28.911
Uh, Lamancha.

1:05:28.913 --> 1:05:30.679
Lamancha.

1:05:30.681 --> 1:05:31.914
Yeah, got it.

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:34.116
You got it.

1:05:34.118 --> 1:05:36.952
- You're made for this.
- Um.

1:05:36.954 --> 1:05:38.687
- It's fun, right?
- Yeah, no, it is fun.

1:05:38.689 --> 1:05:40.456
It's just really messy work.

1:05:40.458 --> 1:05:44.226
Yeah, kind of uh, it reminds me
of when I was in LA,

1:05:44.228 --> 1:05:46.895
I uh, I bussed tables for
a couple of years

1:05:46.897 --> 1:05:49.932
and at the end
of every single shift,

1:05:49.934 --> 1:05:52.000
I was a mess.

1:05:52.002 --> 1:05:53.802
I had food all over me.

1:05:54.972 --> 1:05:56.171
How long did you live there?

1:05:56.173 --> 1:05:59.409
Um, couple of years.

1:05:59.411 --> 1:06:04.880
Uh, I was a singer,
uh singer-songwriter.

1:06:04.882 --> 1:06:05.847
What do you mean was?

1:06:05.849 --> 1:06:07.849
You don't sing anymore?

1:06:07.851 --> 1:06:08.984
No.

1:06:08.986 --> 1:06:11.121
Um, not really.

1:06:13.190 --> 1:06:16.459
Um.

1:06:16.461 --> 1:06:19.295
- I didn't make it, you know.
- Yeah.

1:06:19.297 --> 1:06:23.966
And uh, my label dropped me.

1:06:23.968 --> 1:06:28.870
And I had a very toxic
relationship with vodka.

1:06:28.872 --> 1:06:33.175
And uh, everything
just kinda went sideways.

1:06:33.177 --> 1:06:36.512
I... I lost myself.

1:06:37.781 --> 1:06:40.150
And the reason I went out there
in the first place...

1:06:44.556 --> 1:06:46.788
...I went out there
to be somebody.

1:06:46.790 --> 1:06:50.526
And then, you know
I never thought I'd find myself

1:06:50.528 --> 1:06:52.861
back here doing this.

1:06:54.299 --> 1:06:57.734
Well, if it's any consolation
kind of the shiniest thing

1:06:57.736 --> 1:07:01.304
in this town.

1:07:01.306 --> 1:07:03.839
What do you plan to be
when you grow up, a farmer?

1:07:03.841 --> 1:07:05.941
Oh gosh, I don't know
what I'm gonna be

1:07:05.943 --> 1:07:08.043
when I grow up.

1:07:08.045 --> 1:07:09.978
Kinda lost my compass.

1:07:09.980 --> 1:07:11.181
What's that mean?

1:07:14.319 --> 1:07:15.451
Something happened
with my husband

1:07:15.453 --> 1:07:21.023
and I... I... I...
I just should've talked to him.

1:07:21.025 --> 1:07:24.360
I mean the truth is
we were broke

1:07:24.362 --> 1:07:26.194
and I don't know why
I just didn't talk to him.

1:07:26.196 --> 1:07:30.566
And I just... so stupid.

1:07:30.568 --> 1:07:32.702
I have an idea.

1:07:32.704 --> 1:07:34.038
What are you doing tonight?

1:07:37.174 --> 1:07:38.907
Come on, just because
you lose someone,

1:07:38.909 --> 1:07:41.544
doesn't mean you stop
talking to 'em.

1:07:41.546 --> 1:07:44.148
I come around here all the time
to talk to my grandmother.

1:07:53.991 --> 1:07:56.858
This feels like a terrible idea.

1:07:56.860 --> 1:07:59.094
It's gonna be great, trust me.

1:08:22.587 --> 1:08:25.087
This place is...

1:08:25.089 --> 1:08:27.889
...it's so familiar to me.

1:08:27.891 --> 1:08:30.259
Did there used to be
a driveway here?

1:08:30.261 --> 1:08:33.262
Uh, I don't know.

1:08:33.264 --> 1:08:34.930
It's where Jean grew up.

1:08:34.932 --> 1:08:36.599
Nobody's lived in it for years.

1:08:36.601 --> 1:08:39.935
Yeah, everyone calls it,
"the Halloween house".

1:08:39.937 --> 1:08:42.037
Come on.

1:09:01.191 --> 1:09:05.695
If you wanna lose your virginity
or talk to the dead,

1:09:05.697 --> 1:09:07.399
this is the spot.

1:09:14.739 --> 1:09:16.173
Come on.

1:09:21.111 --> 1:09:24.783
Okay, this is where we do it.

1:09:26.518 --> 1:09:28.718
I really can't believe me that
you convinced me to do this,

1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:32.288
'cause I... I don't believe
in this sort of stuff.

1:09:32.290 --> 1:09:34.257
Close your eyes.

1:09:34.259 --> 1:09:36.224
And take a deep breath.

1:09:39.196 --> 1:09:41.664
Together.

1:09:42.534 --> 1:09:44.199
Deeper.

1:09:48.807 --> 1:09:52.240
We're uh, clearing the circle
to make space

1:09:52.242 --> 1:09:53.609
for the other plane.

1:09:53.611 --> 1:09:54.544
The what?

1:09:55.979 --> 1:09:57.112
Keep your eyes closed.

1:09:57.114 --> 1:09:59.114
They are closed.

1:09:59.116 --> 1:10:02.418
Okay.

1:10:02.420 --> 1:10:03.820
Mmm.

1:10:05.256 --> 1:10:10.393
We hope so we will receive
a sign of your presence.

1:10:10.395 --> 1:10:18.801
Danny, if you're with us, please
join us when you're ready.

1:10:18.803 --> 1:10:20.803
How do we see a sign
if our eyes are closed?

1:10:22.507 --> 1:10:24.841
I feel like you're not taking
this seriously.

1:10:24.843 --> 1:10:26.876
Sorry.

1:10:30.748 --> 1:10:32.415
Can I give it a shot?

1:10:32.417 --> 1:10:36.285
Yeah, sure, be my guest.

1:10:36.287 --> 1:10:45.261
Um, Danny, you can hear me?

1:10:45.263 --> 1:10:46.831
I miss you.

1:10:51.034 --> 1:10:52.904
I really miss you.

1:10:59.042 --> 1:11:02.010
Why didn't I talk to you?

1:11:02.012 --> 1:11:06.047
Why couldn't we just see that
we had enough, you were enough.

1:11:06.049 --> 1:11:08.253
We didn't need more.

1:11:13.458 --> 1:11:16.861
Why am I so mad at you for dying
and leaving us?

1:11:21.866 --> 1:11:24.032
You know, I mean I was the one
that asked you to take Abby

1:11:24.034 --> 1:11:27.539
to school that day, I was
the one who changed the routine.

1:11:30.308 --> 1:11:36.445
And I just feel like
it was my fault.

1:11:36.447 --> 1:11:38.213
And I'm really sorry.

1:11:38.215 --> 1:11:39.717
I'm really...

1:11:42.052 --> 1:11:43.819
...sorry.

1:11:49.394 --> 1:11:52.261
And I love you.

1:11:52.263 --> 1:11:54.530
And the kids love you.

1:11:54.532 --> 1:12:00.738
And I don't know what else
to say.

1:12:06.411 --> 1:12:08.813
I just hope that you're okay
wherever you are.

1:12:16.086 --> 1:12:22.190
I don't think that
really worked.

1:12:22.192 --> 1:12:24.562
You did great.

1:12:28.131 --> 1:12:31.132
You nailed it!

1:13:01.265 --> 1:13:03.265
Don't make me one,
I'm not eating bread.

1:13:03.267 --> 1:13:04.934
Hmm.

1:13:04.936 --> 1:13:07.235
Jean, why didn't you tell me
about that house?

1:13:07.237 --> 1:13:09.672
It's amazing,
it can be so beautiful.

1:13:09.674 --> 1:13:11.139
- You went up there?
- Mhmm.

1:13:11.141 --> 1:13:13.042
Last night with Sunshine.

1:13:13.044 --> 1:13:14.175
It was crazy.

1:13:14.177 --> 1:13:20.049
She convinced me to do
like a circle thing with candles

1:13:20.051 --> 1:13:22.852
- and... and...
- A séance?

1:13:22.854 --> 1:13:23.953
Yeah.

1:13:23.955 --> 1:13:25.388
I don't know, it...

1:13:25.390 --> 1:13:27.256
Did it work?

1:13:31.329 --> 1:13:34.563
I feel better.

1:13:34.565 --> 1:13:36.699
Why'd you let that house go?

1:13:36.701 --> 1:13:38.768
Must've been a great place
to grow up.

1:13:38.770 --> 1:13:41.737
I really want that
for Abby and Tank.

1:13:41.739 --> 1:13:44.373
Abbs, Tank, come on, let's go!

1:13:44.375 --> 1:13:45.975
- We're gonna be late!
- Coming!

1:13:45.977 --> 1:13:49.679
You know, like a home, like a...
like a real home.

1:13:49.681 --> 1:13:53.983
You know, with Marsha
we just moved from town to town

1:13:53.985 --> 1:13:55.785
and husband to husband.

1:13:55.787 --> 1:13:59.088
And just never got to lay
any roots.

1:13:59.090 --> 1:14:01.557
I don't wanna end up like that.

1:14:01.559 --> 1:14:05.061
Well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

1:14:05.063 --> 1:14:07.228
- Go.
- Jeanie, Jeanie.

1:14:07.230 --> 1:14:08.297
- Mornin'.
- Hi honey.

1:14:08.299 --> 1:14:10.266
Abby says there's dancing
at the party.

1:14:10.268 --> 1:14:11.167
I don't know how, Jeanie.

1:14:11.169 --> 1:14:12.535
It's easy.

1:14:12.537 --> 1:14:14.570
Come on, now just fake it.

1:14:14.572 --> 1:14:16.505
Is O'Connor coming
to the dance party?

1:14:16.507 --> 1:14:17.473
Fingers crossed.

1:14:17.475 --> 1:14:18.774
Jeanie.

1:14:18.776 --> 1:14:20.810
Oh what?

1:14:20.812 --> 1:14:22.678
Why yes, of course,
I want a present.

1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:24.280
It's my birthday
for goodness sake.

1:14:24.282 --> 1:14:29.151
But I have one rule, no one is
allowed to buy me a present.

1:14:29.153 --> 1:14:30.419
We have to steal them?

1:14:30.421 --> 1:14:31.721
No!

1:14:31.723 --> 1:14:32.888
What are you talking about?

1:14:32.890 --> 1:14:35.991
- No, you make them, silly.
- You're crazy.

1:14:35.993 --> 1:14:38.160
Look at your face, steal.

1:14:38.162 --> 1:14:39.495
- Bye, Aunt Jean.
- Bye.

1:14:39.497 --> 1:14:43.299
- Bye, Aunt Jeanie.
- Bye.

1:14:43.301 --> 1:14:44.800
Libby.

1:14:44.802 --> 1:14:45.870
Yes, ma'am.

1:14:47.572 --> 1:14:50.139
You're not your mother.

1:14:50.141 --> 1:14:51.709
Fingers crossed.

1:15:23.007 --> 1:15:23.973
Hey.

1:15:23.975 --> 1:15:27.143
Hey, Libby.

1:15:27.145 --> 1:15:28.310
You look tired.

1:15:28.312 --> 1:15:30.913
Oh, thank you.

1:15:30.915 --> 1:15:32.348
How do you feel?

1:15:32.350 --> 1:15:33.382
Tired.

1:15:35.319 --> 1:15:36.652
How's Aaron?

1:15:36.654 --> 1:15:40.189
Um, well, you know,
considering the circumstances,

1:15:40.191 --> 1:15:43.359
she's managing.

1:15:43.361 --> 1:15:45.096
Something's gotta give.

1:15:46.597 --> 1:15:47.897
I'm sorry, it's tough.

1:15:47.899 --> 1:15:50.232
No.

1:15:50.234 --> 1:15:52.168
We're gonna see ya
at Jean's party this weekend,

1:15:52.170 --> 1:15:53.402
right?

1:15:53.404 --> 1:15:57.306
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
if I feel much like a party.

1:15:57.308 --> 1:15:58.207
That makes sense.

1:15:58.209 --> 1:15:59.811
Right, you know.

1:16:04.515 --> 1:16:06.249
- It was nice seeing you.
- You, too.

1:16:06.251 --> 1:16:07.718
- Feel better.
- Hmm.

1:16:10.221 --> 1:16:11.520
Hey, Libby.

1:16:11.522 --> 1:16:13.256
Yeah?

1:16:13.258 --> 1:16:16.759
The farm looks terrible.

1:16:16.761 --> 1:16:18.360
I had a terrible teacher.

1:16:22.466 --> 1:16:24.867
Libby, the school called,
Abby's been hurt.

1:16:24.869 --> 1:16:26.068
What?

1:16:26.070 --> 1:16:27.069
I'll drive.

1:16:41.286 --> 1:16:43.286
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:16:43.288 --> 1:16:44.453
The head always bleeds a lot,

1:16:44.455 --> 1:16:46.388
so that's why her clothes
are so bloody.

1:16:46.390 --> 1:16:47.489
The wound's superficial.

1:16:47.491 --> 1:16:50.125
Yeah, it doesn't look
superficial to me.

1:16:50.127 --> 1:16:51.460
Bug, what happened?

1:16:51.462 --> 1:16:52.895
You can tell me.

1:16:52.897 --> 1:16:56.031
Jimmy Grevoski pushed me
into the fence.

1:16:56.033 --> 1:16:57.466
So that kid
is still bothering you?

1:16:57.468 --> 1:16:58.434
Yes.

1:16:58.436 --> 1:17:00.603
I used my words
and he pushed me.

1:17:00.605 --> 1:17:03.273
Unfortunately, it wasn't
the best choice of words.

1:17:03.275 --> 1:17:05.308
Well, what words did you use?

1:17:05.310 --> 1:17:07.009
I told him to back the eff off.

1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:10.846
That's great.

1:17:10.848 --> 1:17:14.116
Mrs. Moran, can I speak to you
in my office?

1:17:14.118 --> 1:17:16.654
Uh, sure.

1:17:22.827 --> 1:17:23.893
- Thanks.
- What?

1:17:23.895 --> 1:17:25.830
- I didn't do...
- That was nice, thanks.

1:17:29.767 --> 1:17:32.701
You said that?

1:17:32.703 --> 1:17:35.372
You're gonna be okay.

1:17:35.374 --> 1:17:37.673
I believe we're looking
at another suspension.

1:17:37.675 --> 1:17:40.509
You gotta be kidding me,
for saying a bad word?

1:17:40.511 --> 1:17:42.912
That kid pushed her
and she's bleeding.

1:17:42.914 --> 1:17:44.513
Jimmy is also going to receive
a suspension.

1:17:44.515 --> 1:17:45.447
Unbelievable.

1:17:45.449 --> 1:17:47.750
You know what?

1:17:47.752 --> 1:17:50.953
I don't think
you are doing your job.

1:17:50.955 --> 1:17:53.756
My child is supposed to be safe
at school,

1:17:53.758 --> 1:17:56.191
she used her words
just like you said

1:17:56.193 --> 1:17:59.929
and now you're going to suspend
her again for saying a bad word.

1:17:59.931 --> 1:18:01.364
What kind of a school
are you running?

1:18:01.366 --> 1:18:04.600
She's being bullied daily
and you have done nothing

1:18:04.602 --> 1:18:05.901
to stop it.

1:18:05.903 --> 1:18:08.037
Mrs. Moran,
we have a system in place.

1:18:08.039 --> 1:18:12.074
Well, Mrs. Weeks,
your system is broken.

1:18:12.076 --> 1:18:13.175
Yeah.

1:18:13.177 --> 1:18:15.314
I'm gonna get that blood
wiped off you.

1:18:18.215 --> 1:18:19.548
Okay, let's go.

1:18:24.689 --> 1:18:26.624
That's him.

1:18:32.229 --> 1:18:34.364
So what happened with you
and Abby earlier?

1:18:34.366 --> 1:18:35.798
We were just playing.

1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:39.702
Yeah, you want me to play

1:18:39.704 --> 1:18:40.869
No, sir.

1:18:40.871 --> 1:18:43.706
You touch her again
and I will find you,

1:18:43.708 --> 1:18:44.673
you understand me?

1:18:44.675 --> 1:18:46.175

The reason that house
seems familiar to you

1:34:54.078 --> 1:34:57.980
is because you grew up in it
till you were 4.

1:34:57.982 --> 1:34:59.548

1:35:20.871 --> 1:35:24.907
She left you, honey.

She left you with us,

and you let her

1:35:54.373 --> 1:35:55.571
come in and take me?

1:35:55.573 --> 1:35:58.540
There was nothing I could do
to stop her from taking you.

1:35:58.542 --> 1:35:59.775
You should've tried harder.

1:35:59.777 --> 1:36:01.810
You're right, I should've
told 'em she was crazy.

1:36:01.812 --> 1:36:02.811
I should've lied.

1:36:02.813 --> 1:36:05.281
I should've fought harder
for you.

1:36:05.283 --> 1:36:08.751
But she was your mother,
there was nothing we could do.

1:36:08.753 --> 1:36:12.821

this whole time.

1:36:12.823 --> 1:36:14.823

why didn't you tell me?

1:36:31.443 --> 1:36:33.276

your mom wanted to sell

1:36:33.278 --> 1:36:35.577

All of my good memories
are in it.

1:36:38.616 --> 1:36:41.817
And for a long time I was hoping
you'd come home again.

1:36:41.819 --> 1:36:44.620

feel better, Jean?

1:36:44.622 --> 1:36:46.090

1:37:59.630 --> 1:38:02.197
Jerry, and he is a keeper.

1:38:02.199 --> 1:38:03.866
He's in the energy business

1:38:03.868 --> 1:38:07.803
and I met him
at the downtown club happy hour.

1:38:07.805 --> 1:38:09.372
That sounds promising.

1:38:09.374 --> 1:38:12.074
Maybe, we'll see.

1:38:12.076 --> 1:38:16.546
I guess it feels good
to finally know why

1:38:16.548 --> 1:38:21.717
there weren't any baby photos
of me growing up.

1:38:21.719 --> 1:38:25.154
I used to think it was,
because I wasn't pretty enough

1:38:25.156 --> 1:38:27.156
or my clothes weren't right.

1:38:27.158 --> 1:38:29.359
Alright, well, she told you.

1:38:29.361 --> 1:38:30.426
Yeah, she told me.

1:38:30.428 --> 1:38:31.528
And now you're mad at me.

1:38:31.530 --> 1:38:32.495
Huh!

1:38:32.497 --> 1:38:33.363
I'm not...

1:38:34.665 --> 1:38:38.334
...mad at you.

1:38:38.336 --> 1:38:40.303
Well, good, you shouldn't be,
because I was a child

1:38:40.305 --> 1:38:42.004
with a child.

1:38:42.006 --> 1:38:44.072
And anybody who knew me at 18,

1:38:44.074 --> 1:38:49.178
knew that I was in no way ready
to raise a baby.

1:38:49.180 --> 1:38:54.450
See I was not natural mama,
not like you.

1:38:54.452 --> 1:38:55.385
But I came back.

1:38:55.387 --> 1:38:59.087
You didn't,
you came back for a funeral.

1:38:59.089 --> 1:39:01.291
Don't be a martyr, Libby.

1:39:01.293 --> 1:39:03.091
You just sound like Jean,
Saint Jean.

1:39:03.093 --> 1:39:05.060
This isn't about Jean,
this is about you and me

1:39:05.062 --> 1:39:06.462
and the fact that
you didn't want me.

1:39:06.464 --> 1:39:07.463
That's not true.

1:39:07.465 --> 1:39:09.798
It just feels like you wanted
what Jean had.

1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:16.838
Wow, well, that is ridiculous.

1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:18.374
I want you to listen to me.

1:39:18.376 --> 1:39:22.244
You just have to know that
I was a mess.

1:39:22.246 --> 1:39:24.913
I was a mess
and I had to grow up.

1:39:24.915 --> 1:39:27.550
Alright?

1:39:27.552 --> 1:39:32.955
And then when Mama died,
I came back for you,

1:39:32.957 --> 1:39:35.157
'cause I did the right thing.

1:39:35.159 --> 1:39:38.727
Because you're mine.

1:39:38.729 --> 1:39:41.063
You are my blood.

1:39:41.065 --> 1:39:43.832
And... and I made sure that
you did not have to grow up

1:39:43.834 --> 1:39:46.201
in that place.

1:39:46.203 --> 1:39:48.003
- You were better off with me.
- Was I?

1:39:48.005 --> 1:39:52.908
'Cause I'm not so sure.

1:39:52.910 --> 1:39:56.646
And I just don't know
if I can forgive you

1:39:56.648 --> 1:39:59.282
for taking me away from there.

1:40:00.252 --> 1:40:02.951
Because I was happy
and I think you knew it.

1:40:02.953 --> 1:40:04.354
That is... is crazy.

1:40:04.356 --> 1:40:05.588
- Mama, please...
- Libby, I was...

1:40:05.590 --> 1:40:07.624
Stop.

1:40:07.626 --> 1:40:09.059
Stop.

1:40:13.197 --> 1:40:16.666
You've gotta get ready.

1:40:16.668 --> 1:40:17.667
You look really pretty.

1:40:17.669 --> 1:40:18.336
Oh, come on.

1:41:12.290 --> 1:41:14.191
YOUNG
Frank, take her.

1:41:17.796 --> 1:41:19.094
Okay.

1:41:19.096 --> 1:41:21.399
Bye, baby.

1:42:19.524 --> 1:42:21.591
I'm sorry.

1:42:21.593 --> 1:42:22.924
No more secrets.

1:42:22.926 --> 1:42:25.461
There aren't anymore.

1:42:25.463 --> 1:42:26.995
Promise?

1:42:26.997 --> 1:42:30.098
It's the truth.

1:42:30.100 --> 1:42:31.768
I wanna live here,
in this house

1:42:31.770 --> 1:42:34.437
with Abby and Tank.

1:42:34.439 --> 1:42:38.708
I'll run your farm
and I'll pay off of the top.

1:42:38.710 --> 1:42:40.110
Alright.

1:42:43.882 --> 1:42:45.850
This is my home.

1:42:53.391 --> 1:42:56.091
Oh look, there's a bird's nest
up there.

1:42:56.093 --> 1:42:58.059
I wonder if there's
any little eggs in there.

1:43:17.916 --> 1:43:19.247
- Hey.
- There you go.

1:43:19.249 --> 1:43:20.585
Hey, what are you looking at?

1:43:25.690 --> 1:43:28.089
That was Easter Sunday,
you lost a tooth that day.

1:43:28.091 --> 1:43:29.358
Oh.

1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:30.795
That was a good day.

1:43:32.831 --> 1:43:34.229
Is your dress blue?

1:43:34.231 --> 1:43:36.699
Mhmm, yeah.

1:43:36.701 --> 1:43:38.935
I remember.

1:43:38.937 --> 1:43:41.236
Look how tiny you were.

1:43:41.238 --> 1:43:42.971
You know what, I don't know
what we were doing there

1:43:42.973 --> 1:43:44.941
while I was handling you.

1:43:44.943 --> 1:43:46.375
Get all dirty.

1:43:48.078 --> 1:43:49.278
What?

1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:52.113
I don't know what we were doing
and I can't see.

1:44:04.729 --> 1:44:06.297
Are you even
good at fixing those?

1:44:11.034 --> 1:44:12.033
When did that happen?

1:44:12.035 --> 1:44:14.002
Oh, this?

1:44:14.004 --> 1:44:15.505
A couple of days ago.

1:44:15.507 --> 1:44:18.774
It was when I got back
from El Paso.

1:44:18.776 --> 1:44:21.410
How'd that go?

1:44:21.412 --> 1:44:23.546
I think it was for the best.

1:44:26.351 --> 1:44:28.751
So are you back on the payroll?

1:44:28.753 --> 1:44:29.854
Yep.

1:44:32.824 --> 1:44:35.391
- Kids are gonna freak out.
- Yeah?

1:44:35.393 --> 1:44:36.492
Yeah, they really missed you.

1:44:36.494 --> 1:44:37.727
They did?

1:44:37.729 --> 1:44:40.128
Yeah, they did.

1:44:40.130 --> 1:44:42.163
What about you?
You missed me?

1:45:04.989 --> 1:45:06.054
No, not really.

1:45:06.056 --> 1:45:08.791
