00:06.743 --> 00:09.778
Hey, are those the new
sneakers you're endorsing?

00:09.779 --> 00:11.647
Yeah, they're called
Moon walkers.

00:11.648 --> 00:14.176
They're good on the basketball
court or the dance floor.

00:14.484 --> 00:17.253
Whoo!

00:19.256 --> 00:25.294
Anyway, the shoe company wants me
to wear these every time I perform.

00:25.295 --> 00:26.675
You can debut them tonight
on "video countdown live".

00:26.699 --> 00:27.863
I am so excited for the
"Austin Moon special."

00:27.864 --> 00:29.265
Nice work, Trish.

00:29.266 --> 00:30.666
Hey, it's my job.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.747
Most managers would be happy
with a simple thank you.

00:33.770 --> 00:34.770
I'm not like them.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.973
Here's a list of
things you can buy me.

00:37.974 --> 00:39.742
I can't wait to see
what fans voted on

00:41.478 --> 00:42.845
for your top ten performances.

00:42.846 --> 00:46.682
I personally voted 700
times for "finally me."

00:46.683 --> 00:48.403
That's Ally's song. I've
never performed it.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.221
Hey, I like what I like.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.955 --> 02:00.289
What are you doing, Austin?

02:00.290 --> 02:02.057
I'm looking for my Moon walkers.

02:02.058 --> 02:07.062
I packed everything else. My lucky
shirt, my lucky brush, my...

02:07.063 --> 02:09.064
I'm not sure what
this is doing here.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.302
You guys ready to
start the show?

02:14.571 --> 02:15.971
Uh, actually, we
just need a few...

02:15.972 --> 02:18.307
And we're live!

02:18.308 --> 02:20.876
We're counting down the top
ten Austin Moon performances.

02:20.877 --> 02:22.044
As voted on by you, the fans.

02:22.679 --> 02:25.614
And at the end of our show,

02:27.017 --> 02:28.417
Austin's gonna
perform for us live.

02:31.054 --> 02:34.056
Now, let's get him out here.

02:34.057 --> 02:36.525
I can't go on camera
without my sneakers.

02:36.526 --> 02:38.961
They must be at sonic boom.

02:38.962 --> 02:40.062
You guys cover for me.

02:40.063 --> 02:41.063
I'll take care of this.

02:42.832 --> 02:44.900
Hey, don't say anything
to embarrass Austin.

02:44.901 --> 02:46.402
Please.

02:46.403 --> 02:48.103
Jett, Austin's gonna be a while.

02:49.606 --> 02:51.740
He's backstage
popping a huge zit.

02:51.741 --> 02:53.062
Okay, disgusting.
Roll the video.

02:55.345 --> 02:56.825
Here's number ten,
"can you feel it?"

04:21.598 --> 04:22.631
Looking for these?

04:22.632 --> 04:24.833
Brooke!

04:24.834 --> 04:26.101
How did you get those?

04:26.102 --> 04:27.903
Well, I certainly didn't
sneak into shredders,

04:30.073 --> 04:36.261
take them out of your bag, then lure
you back here to write me a love song.

04:36.292 --> 04:38.013
Why does it seem like that's
exactly what you did?

04:38.014 --> 04:40.783
I can't write a song, I have
to be on "vcl" right now.

04:40.784 --> 04:42.951
Well, then you
better write fast.

04:42.952 --> 04:44.853
Or the shoes get it.

04:44.854 --> 04:45.921
Not the shoes.

05:57.193 --> 06:01.063
That was number
nine, "timeless."

06:01.064 --> 06:02.544
Now, let's ask Austin
some questions.

06:02.832 --> 06:04.733
We can answer for him.

06:06.135 --> 06:08.237
Uh, let me guess...

06:08.238 --> 06:09.958
He's busy trimming his
nose hairs now, huh?

06:10.173 --> 06:11.773
Maybe.

06:13.042 --> 06:14.309
Ask us anything.

06:14.310 --> 06:16.879
We know everything about Austin.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.981
Uh, okay, what's his
favorite cereal?

06:26.155 --> 06:28.957
Wow, you guys are real
Austin Moon authorities.

06:30.293 --> 06:32.094
Okay, here's number
eight, "don't look down."

08:28.878 --> 08:32.047
Write a love song that tells the
world how you feel about me.

08:32.048 --> 08:34.082
Or say goodbye to your
precious Moon walkers.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.683
You wouldn't dare.

08:35.684 --> 08:38.720
I'll start with the shoelace.

08:38.721 --> 08:40.441
It'll be a perfect
addition to my scrapbook.

08:44.059 --> 08:45.360
Sorry, wackadoodle.

08:46.129 --> 08:48.997
You took off the door handle?

08:50.933 --> 08:51.933
I'm trapped.

09:03.279 --> 09:05.180
Austin should have
been back by now.

09:05.181 --> 09:06.314
We better call him.

09:11.754 --> 09:13.822
Oh.

09:14.824 --> 09:16.258
Hello, Austin?

09:16.259 --> 09:19.127
What? No, it's me, Dez. I'm
trying to find Austin.

09:19.128 --> 09:21.463
Dez, you're talking to yourself.

09:21.464 --> 09:24.499
Austin gave you his phone to
hold while he went on stage.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.369
Oh.

09:27.370 --> 09:29.171
Hey, can I call you back?

09:29.172 --> 09:30.439
Yeah, sure.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.274
Austin had better get here soon.

09:35.745 --> 09:36.812
I promised millions of fans he would
sing live at the end of the show.

09:36.813 --> 09:38.847
Hey, I'm just his manager.

09:38.848 --> 09:40.982
I'm not in charge of managing
where he's at, at what time.

09:40.983 --> 09:42.451
Wait, that's exactly what I do.

09:44.954 --> 09:46.221
I'll go look for him.

09:46.222 --> 09:47.982
And that was number
seven, "better together."

09:51.461 --> 09:53.295
You know what else
is better together?

09:53.296 --> 09:56.364
Austin Moon and my show,
that he promised to be on.

09:56.365 --> 10:00.101
Next up, number
six, "double take."

10:53.089 --> 10:54.155
How was that?

10:54.156 --> 10:56.057
I hate it.

10:56.058 --> 10:58.660
But don't give up, darling.

10:58.661 --> 10:59.661
You're so talented.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.164
Come on, Brooke. Give
me the door handle.

11:06.469 --> 11:12.040
I told you, you're not leaving
here until you finish my song!

11:12.041 --> 11:13.681
- Austin, there you...
- Don't shut the...

11:15.545 --> 11:16.545
door.

12:23.045 --> 12:26.081
That was number
five, "illusion."

12:26.082 --> 12:29.384
I'm starting to think that Austin
might also be an illusion.

12:29.385 --> 12:31.419
We have to keep stalling.

12:31.420 --> 12:34.389
I'll ask Jett some questions and
make sure he keeps talking.

12:34.390 --> 12:36.157
Anyway...

12:37.093 --> 12:40.428
Jett, why don't you tell me something
interesting about yourself.

12:40.429 --> 12:45.500
Oh, well, before I became a TV host I
was an international undercover spy.

12:45.501 --> 12:47.035
- I had a cool...
- Boring.

12:47.036 --> 12:48.470
Let's go to the next video clip.

12:48.471 --> 12:49.631
"I've got that rock n' roll."

12:54.977 --> 12:56.544
Way to keep him talking.

13:55.337 --> 13:57.572
We need to text Ally for help.

13:57.573 --> 14:00.341
Yeah, this song you're writing
for Brooke is terrible.

14:00.342 --> 14:04.145
Not to help me write, to
help us get out of here.

14:04.146 --> 14:06.081
But don't let Brooke see you.
She'll hurt my shoes.

14:06.082 --> 14:07.182
Got it.

14:07.183 --> 14:09.317
Hey, Brooke.

14:09.318 --> 14:11.052
Sit next to Austin.

14:11.053 --> 14:12.654
It'll help inspire him.

14:18.027 --> 14:19.194
What are you doing?

14:19.195 --> 14:20.355
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

14:21.597 --> 14:23.231
Getting lost in your eyes.

14:24.533 --> 14:29.137
Your beautiful,
greenish-brown, scary eyes.

14:40.616 --> 14:42.536
And now, at number three,
"living in the moment."

14:52.194 --> 14:56.164
Oh, it's from Trish.

14:56.165 --> 14:57.232
"Trapped by books in the plastic room.
Rescue us."

14:57.233 --> 14:58.366
What does that mean?

14:58.367 --> 15:01.302
It's perfectly clear.

15:01.303 --> 15:04.105
Grab the rescue bus and let's get
to the library. That's not it.

15:04.106 --> 15:07.142
Why does books have
a capital "b"?

15:07.143 --> 15:09.077
It must be Brooke!

15:09.078 --> 15:11.246
"Trapped by Brooke in
the practice room.

15:11.247 --> 15:12.313
Rescue us."

15:12.314 --> 15:13.815
Maybe.

15:13.816 --> 15:15.283
I'm still not sold on it.

15:15.284 --> 15:16.764
All right, I'm getting
tired of this.

15:17.653 --> 15:20.221
Austin had better be
here in five minutes.

15:20.222 --> 15:23.658
Uh, what if he can't make it?

15:23.659 --> 15:27.595
Well, then this network will never air
another Austin Moon video ever again.

15:30.800 --> 15:35.470
You do realize if you cut Austin from
your network, you'll also be losing me.

15:35.471 --> 15:38.273
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

15:52.788 --> 15:54.255
I have the perfect plan, Ally.

15:54.256 --> 15:57.258
I'll stay here and stall Jett, while
you sneak into the practice room

15:57.259 --> 15:58.493
and rescue Austin and Trish.

15:58.494 --> 16:00.261
If I'm sneaking into
the practice room,

16:02.184 --> 16:03.464
why are you wearing that outfit?

16:03.465 --> 16:04.499
Black is very slimming.

16:06.435 --> 16:09.571
Just go get them.

16:43.172 --> 16:46.808
Uh... hey, guys.

16:46.809 --> 16:48.743
This is your idea of a rescue?

16:48.744 --> 16:50.545
What gave me away?

16:50.546 --> 16:54.182
Singing your own action
music kinda tipped us off.

16:54.183 --> 16:55.383
I'm never getting out of here.

17:06.194 --> 17:08.896
And now, we've arrived
at the number one song.

17:08.897 --> 17:14.469
Out of all the Austin Moon
performances, you chose this... as...

17:14.470 --> 17:16.404
The... best...

17:16.405 --> 17:19.273
The... final... song.

17:19.275 --> 17:19.907
Here we go.

17:19.909 --> 17:21.943
The... number...

17:21.944 --> 17:23.578
<i>one...</i>

17:23.579 --> 17:25.813
song...

17:25.814 --> 17:27.315
is...

17:27.316 --> 17:29.918
- Just say it already!
- "You can come to me"!

17:31.620 --> 17:32.954
Ooh, I love that video.

17:32.955 --> 17:33.955
Austin's got two minutes.

17:33.956 --> 17:35.037
But I can't stay and watch.

18:26.642 --> 18:28.476
If we don't break
down that door now

18:29.678 --> 18:31.379
you're gonna miss your
live performance.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.916
Okay.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.884
I don't even care about
the sneakers anymore.

18:36.885 --> 18:37.986
Let's just get out of here.

18:44.293 --> 18:45.760
What are you guys doing?

18:45.761 --> 18:47.528
Nothing... go!

18:52.501 --> 18:54.736
I'll take these.

19:00.109 --> 19:03.011
Austin! Austin! Austin!

19:03.012 --> 19:05.847
Uh, I am sorry to
have to say this.

19:05.848 --> 19:07.582
Austin Moon is not coming.

19:09.718 --> 19:11.753
Because I'm already here.

19:16.885 --> 19:18.726
You will never believewhat
I just went through.

19:18.727 --> 19:20.328
Don't care. Just sing.

19:20.329 --> 19:22.049
Thanks, everyone, for
voting for my videos.

19:24.066 --> 19:26.734
This is a special song I
wrote for all my fans.

19:26.735 --> 19:27.735
Except Brooke.

19:28.003 --> 19:30.772
This is called "upside down."

21:59.121 --> 22:04.859
The shoe companywas really happy
with your "VCL" performance.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.727
Your Moon walkers are selling like crazy.
People love shoes that you can dance in

22:06.728 --> 22:08.095
and play basketball in.

22:08.096 --> 22:10.031
Whoo! Bam!

22:12.000 --> 22:13.720
Do you have to keep doing
that with my food?

22:15.103 --> 22:16.823
Austin's Moon walkers
inspired me to design

22:18.707 --> 22:20.174
my own multi-functional
footwear.

22:20.175 --> 22:22.710
Check out my infomercial.

22:22.711 --> 22:26.113
Do people laugh at
your skinny legs?

22:26.114 --> 22:27.915
<i>Well, fret no more.</i>

22:27.916 --> 22:30.151
<i>Introducing the calf blaster.</i>

22:30.152 --> 22:33.287
<i>A formal-slash-workout
shoe, all in one.</i>

22:33.288 --> 22:35.890
<i>You get a workout in every step.</i>

22:35.891 --> 22:39.794
<i>Look what it's done for me
in just three short days...</i>

22:39.795 --> 22:41.028
<i>Norder in the next ten
minutes and I'll throw in</i>

22:41.029 --> 22:42.096
<i>my grandmother's mean cat.</i>
