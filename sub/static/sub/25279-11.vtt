WEBVTT

00:08.133 --> 00:09.092
[Beau] Mornin'.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.262
Morning. You birdwatchin'
or scopin' out dinner?

00:14.931 --> 00:16.599
I love birds.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.894
Except for cardinals, ravens,
falcons, and seahawks.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.399
What about the eagles?
Don't you hate them?

00:25.025 --> 00:27.152
It's unpatriotic to hate an eagle.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.531
And yet, you hate the Patriots.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.411
I don't hate the Patriots.
I hate Tom Brady.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.625
It's unnatural for a man
to be that pretty.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.591
Okay, I gotta get to the Cracker Barrel.
I'm training a new waitress.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.676
Her name is Sunshine.

00:52.635 --> 00:53.678
Sunshine?

00:54.512 --> 00:56.765
You should train her parents
how to name their kid.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.643
Yeah, and she was born in 2001.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.187
How the fuck is that a thing?

01:04.272 --> 01:05.315
Drives me crazy.

01:05.398 --> 01:06.733
She's always on her phone,

01:06.816 --> 01:08.902
not payin' attention,
playin' with her hair.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.779
They should've named her "Colt."

01:14.741 --> 01:17.577
I see you've come around with the Keurig.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.790
Yeah. Can't imagine that
I haven't always started my mornin'

01:21.873 --> 01:24.125
with Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.252
[door knocks]

01:28.421 --> 01:29.923
Howdy, neighbors.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.717
Name's Colt Bennett,
I own the stretch down the road.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.139
I just wanted to stop by
and let you know my door's always open.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.102
Mainly 'cause my house burned down,
and I don't have a door.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.397
Y'know, erm...

01:46.481 --> 01:49.901
Beau didn't even speak
to his last neighbor for over 30 years.

01:49.984 --> 01:53.238
Yeah? First off, his last neighbor
wasn't as good looking.

01:55.073 --> 01:59.077
And he never brought him hot coffee
and a dozen of his favorite donuts.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.996
There's 11 plain and one powdered,

02:02.080 --> 02:04.624
'cause I know you like
to have somethin' to complain about.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.252
Hang on. Where's that coffee from?

02:07.544 --> 02:08.378
The gas station.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.005
Only place you can stir in your sugar
with a Slim Jim.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.467
Perfect.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.849
Ahh! Now that should be a Keurig flavor.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.312
You could call it
"Circle K Burnt to Shit."

02:28.606 --> 02:29.774
-Thanks, neighbor.
-[Colt] Yep.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.860
-I'll see you in 30 years.
-[Colt and Joanne chuckle]

02:32.569 --> 02:33.945
Hey, you guys see Rooster?

02:34.487 --> 02:37.198
He wasn't at the hunting cabin
and his bike's gone.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.409
And Jill at the Circle K
said he didn't stop in

02:39.492 --> 02:41.661
for his morning Red Bull and nachos.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.584
So... he was late
for his first day at work.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.502
Well, shit.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.548
What?

02:58.178 --> 03:01.306
I had Rooster fuckin' up first.
She had you.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.268
Nothing personal.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.853
You fuck up a lot.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.231
Yeah, I get it.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.526
When I was playin' football,
I made a lot of money bettin' against me.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.485
[Colt sniggers]

03:16.362 --> 03:19.616
Man, I can't believe Rooster
pulled this shit on a first day of work.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.452
But y'know what? It's fine.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.037
He can skip out today.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.997
Come first time we've gotta birth a calf,

03:26.080 --> 03:30.001
you'll find my ass drunk and streaking
through the infield at Talladega.

03:31.961 --> 03:35.340
Please tell me more about things
that are no longer my problem.

03:35.423 --> 03:36.257
[Colt laughs]

03:37.800 --> 03:41.387
Such as, have they discontinued
some of your facial scrubs?

03:44.682 --> 03:45.558
No.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.810
Just the opposite.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.314
Now they're selling that loganberry
exfoliant in the 18-ounce bottle.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.150
Hang on.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.320
Take that fuckin' powdered donut.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.533
And the other three that touched it.

[Abby] <i>Doctor said our little girl's</i>

05:16.107 --> 05:18.526
<i>so I'm happy she's got her mama's smarts</i>

05:18.609 --> 05:21.321
<i>but I'm not happy that giant head</i>

05:23.865 --> 05:25.366
They show you her throwin' arm?

05:25.658 --> 05:27.702
<i>Hm. Doctor said it looks strong.</i>

05:28.202 --> 05:30.079
<i>So she's got her mama's arm, too.</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:31.331
[chuckles]

05:32.623 --> 05:33.958
<i>You wanna talk to her?</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:37.003
Yeah, sure.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.425
Hey, sweetheart.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.762
Sorry I can't be there.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.308
I promise you, I'm gonna be at
every recital and Christmas pageant.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.645
If you decide to play a sport where
you run around with a ribbon on a stick,

05:55.396 --> 05:59.108
I'll be there with a sweatshirt on
that says "Proud Dad of Ribbon Girl."

06:00.860 --> 06:02.612
Unless it's the same day
as the Super Bowl.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.322
Why would they do that, though?

06:06.240 --> 06:07.367
Hey, Colt!

06:07.450 --> 06:08.743
Hey. Just...

06:10.036 --> 06:13.206
Hey, little floatin' Abby head!

06:13.289 --> 06:14.540
How you feelin'?

06:17.335 --> 06:19.754
Looks like you're about to calf.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.173
<i>Hey, Dale.</i>

06:22.256 --> 06:24.801
<i>A pregnant woman always loves</i>
<i>being compared to a farm animal.</i>

06:26.761 --> 06:29.472
Oh. Well... you never looked
more beautiful.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.518
<i>Thank you. I'm gonna go. Love you, Colt.</i>

06:33.601 --> 06:36.062
Okay. I'll talk to you soon, babe.<i> </i>Bye.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.026
I thought that "calf" thing
was kinda cute.

06:42.110 --> 06:46.030
You coulda backed me up
while she's still on the line, asshole.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.117
Oh, no.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.952
I made that mistake before.

06:51.035 --> 06:54.539
A couple weeks ago, she come home
with a new pair of pink pajamas.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.998
I said, "Who's my little piggy?"

06:56.666 --> 06:58.209
Slept in the tub that night.

07:00.878 --> 07:01.754
How'd the herd look?

07:02.338 --> 07:04.215
Oh, they're putting on weight real well,

07:04.298 --> 07:08.386
kinda like my niece in her freshman year
at Colorado State.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.222
Apparently, she was majoring in pasta.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.393
Well, that's one piece
of good news, I suppose.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.478
Not for her diabetes.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.150
But I do have one piece of bad news.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.861
I couldn't find Heifer 306.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.279
Yeah?

07:26.821 --> 07:30.408
Sometimes them tags get turned
upside down. Did you find 9-O-E?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.872
No, I looked all over the pasture.
I couldn't see hide nor hoof of--

07:36.998 --> 07:39.041
Did I just come up with that phrase?

07:39.834 --> 07:40.793
I'll tell you something,

07:40.877 --> 07:44.005
that is gonna go on a T-shirt
on my Etsy store.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.258
That's just great.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.969
On my first day on the new ranch

07:50.052 --> 07:53.014
I'm already down a brother,
a tractor and now, a cow.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.308
I stress-ate six donuts.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.852
I'm starting to get a muffin top
on top of my Wranglers.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.355
I remember my first day as a vet.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.233
I'm sorry, Dale, I ain't got time
for one of your stories right now.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.986
I've gotta go find that cow.
Maybe I should jog there.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.281
Yeah, I totally understand.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.867
It was 1970.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.747
I'd just diagnosed mad cow disease

08:17.830 --> 08:19.081
for Mike Beale's herd.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.834
Shut the whole operation down.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.254
Turned out I'd dripped
a little ketchup out of my Whopper

08:25.338 --> 08:27.256
into the blood sample.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.842
[still laughing]

08:29.926 --> 08:33.346
You know what cow would have been mad
about that Whopper? Your niece.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.026
Hey, Joanne.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.277
You're home early.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.030
Yeah, 'cause I just got fired.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.156
What?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.700
I get to work, my manager tells me
they have to let me go.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.327
Guess who replaced me?

08:56.410 --> 08:57.787
Fuckin' Sunshine.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.373
That's right.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.253
I got replaced by somebody
who couldn't work last weekend

09:05.336 --> 09:06.712
because she was grounded.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.425
Jesus, Joanne, this is awful.
What'd they say?

09:11.509 --> 09:14.512
Nothin'. Just they had to give me
two weeks' notice.

09:14.595 --> 09:18.015
I said, "You can take those two weeks
and shove them up your fuckin' ass."

09:19.892 --> 09:23.479
Then I apologized
to the nice Mormon family on table eight.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.065
Then I got escorted off the property.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.443
Well, don't worry about the Mormons.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.738
Can't trust anyone who wants to deal
with more than one wife.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.409
I can't believe this.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.078
You've been working
at the Cracker Barrel forever.

09:40.621 --> 09:44.333
Yeah, they don't care
about experience or loyalty.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.877
Couple months back,
I had a bad case of the flu,

09:46.961 --> 09:48.337
I still went to work.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.215
Three days later, half the staff
called in sick. I was there.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.511
I'm so sorry you have to deal with this.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.305
It's gonna be fine.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.266
You're the hardest-working woman I know.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.769
You know what they say...

10:04.645 --> 10:08.024
"When God closes a Barrel, he opens a...

10:08.816 --> 10:10.276
Waffle House."

10:13.321 --> 10:14.322
Thanks, Beau.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.450
Well, now that I have the day off I...

10:17.950 --> 10:19.952
might as well go look for something else.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.454
Gotta pay the bills.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.332
Of course, with my house burned down,
Visa's gotta find me first.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.001
That's the attitude.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.670
You'll find someplace better to work.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.381
Preferably no ethnic food.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.510
Although I suppose I could deal
with the Olive Garden.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.354
Rooster, I just hit the Powerball.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.190
That's right, 75 million dollars.

10:51.192 --> 10:55.112
Yeah, that's 75 million dollar tacos.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.951
Or one gigantic 75-million-dollar taco.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.706
Call me back or I'm gonna have
to split it with someone else.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.460
Hey, it's my best friend, Colt.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.464
You look good today.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.134
I didn't win the lotto, Hank,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.762
I'm just trying to get my dipshit brother
to call me back.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.099
And I'm just trying
to give my friend a compliment.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.310
Hey, Colt. You want a Bud?

11:26.394 --> 11:29.397
No, I ain't got time.
I gotta get back to the ranch.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.234
Just stopped by on my way back from
the feed store to see if Rooster's here.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.445
Oh, y'know, actually,
can you fill this back up?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.863
It's Bud Light.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.451
Smart. You're driving.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.705
Rooster hasn't been here all day.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.123
He text you?

11:47.707 --> 11:49.208
I dunno. Let's see.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.503
Hmm. Darlene wants to kill her kids.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.048
Heather also wants to kill Darlene's kids.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.344
Checking account, less than $25.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.264
That's it, nothin' from Rooster.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.557
What the fuck?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.393
He didn't show up on the first day.
He won't text me back.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.812
It's like, when did I become
the responsible one?

12:13.524 --> 12:15.317
Y'know, how many places
could he be, seriously?

12:15.401 --> 12:18.070
Here, the ranch,
Dairy Queen, strip club,

12:18.154 --> 12:19.488
the other Dairy Queen?

12:21.323 --> 12:22.950
Did they open a third Dairy Queen?

12:23.033 --> 12:23.993
[scoffs]

12:24.493 --> 12:28.330
No. Apparently, 500 signatures
don't mean anythin' to them people.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.837
-When's the last time you talked to him?
-Last night. He came here.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.505
He offered me a ticket to <i>Wrestlemania.</i>

12:36.589 --> 12:37.757
You guys are goin'?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.258
Cool. So are me and Abby.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.385
Assumin' our tickets
ever show up in the mail.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.058
Was he acting weird?

12:48.684 --> 12:50.269
He was a little freaked out about Nick.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.689
Once I told him Nick went back
to Ohio, though, Rooster seemed fine.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.776
Yeah, okay.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.030
You're right. I'll swing by
the Dairy Queen and the strip club.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.491
Even if I don't find him,
it's still a pretty good day.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.330
Erm, if you see Darlene, will you tell her
I cannot babysit tonight?

13:09.413 --> 13:11.248
Oh, shit, she's working
at the Dairy Queen now?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.084
Yeah, sure.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.215
[cell phone vibrates]

13:21.175 --> 13:22.051
Ah.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.387
Dad, you butt-dialed me again!

13:28.849 --> 13:29.809
Shit.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.104
Yeah, I'm just down at the bar.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

13:35.064 --> 13:35.940
All right.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.692
-Is it about Rooster?
-No.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.945
No, he found a cow. What's left of it.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.279
Apparently, a wolf got it.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.906
I gotta go.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.450
But give me a holler
if you hear from Rooster, all right?

13:46.534 --> 13:49.119
Yeah, know what? I'm gonna text him
a picture of my boobs.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.999
If he doesn't respond to that,
we know something's wrong.

13:54.083 --> 13:54.959
[Colt] Sure.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.214
Hey, it's my best friend Mary.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.597
[insects chirping]

14:15.396 --> 14:17.022
[whispering] Man, that thing is torn up.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.650
I think we're looking at a pack.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.820
I only saw one set of tracks.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.198
Probably just a lone wolf,
got pushed out of the pack.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.912
How could you not notice
you were missin' a cow?

14:33.706 --> 14:34.748
Oh, I noticed.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.876
I was looking for it all afternoon.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.127
At the bar?

14:39.336 --> 14:41.589
Just 'cause that's
where we always find you

14:41.672 --> 14:43.674
that doesn't mean
that's where the cows go.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.053
What a day!

14:48.888 --> 14:51.807
Cow gets hit, tractor's not runnin'...

14:51.891 --> 14:55.436
my pee smells like asparagus.
I haven't had asparagus in months.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.729
Hey, you tell me.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.690
I was at the bar looking for Rooster.

14:59.773 --> 15:00.649
[Beau] Yeah?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.109
And?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.111
Mary ain't heard from him either.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.864
Look, he's only been gone for 12 hours.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.408
For him, that's not missing, that's late.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.619
And if it were you, that'd be early.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.708
Something don't feel right.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.670
You know he started hookin' up
with Mary again?

15:22.504 --> 15:23.839
Her ex-husband Nick...

15:24.548 --> 15:25.424
threatened him.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.469
That dude's creepy, man.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.930
He's like the clown from <i>It</i>

15:31.013 --> 15:33.015
if he sold all his makeup to buy meth.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.686
Mary was married to a clown?

15:39.521 --> 15:40.564
No. It's...

15:41.565 --> 15:43.025
Yes, she married a clown.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.821
What is it...? There's something goin' on.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.908
-I think this Nick guy knows somethin'.
-Well, hell...

15:51.659 --> 15:54.912
Your brother gets himself
into these situations all the time.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.667
He disappears for a couple of days,
then he comes home and says,

15:59.750 --> 16:00.751
"Hey, Dad...

16:01.460 --> 16:03.587
if a chick's husband
comes lookin' for me...

16:04.129 --> 16:05.339
tell him I'm dead.

16:05.756 --> 16:09.093
But tell him I died
in a real badass way. He he he."

16:13.097 --> 16:15.099
He was so excited about this ranch.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.308
We had a whole plan.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.978
We was gonna disk up the field,
make it look like crop circles,

16:19.061 --> 16:20.813
try to convince you that aliens landed.

16:20.896 --> 16:21.939
[Beau chuckles]

16:22.690 --> 16:24.566
We was even gonna give Shaggy 20 bucks

16:24.650 --> 16:26.819
to paint himself green
and run around naked.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.530
He agreed to do it
before we even offered him money.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
If we don't hear from Rooster tomorrow...

16:34.368 --> 16:35.327
we'll deal with it.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.622
You keep kiddin' about those aliens.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.374
I'll be all safe in my bunker

16:40.457 --> 16:43.627
and E.T. will be [laughs] probin' your ass

16:43.711 --> 16:44.878
with that finger of his.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.213
[laughs] Jesus, Dad.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.382
Oh.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.426
All I'm sayin'...

16:51.885 --> 16:54.221
as excited as he was,
for him to not show up--

16:54.304 --> 16:55.389
-Hey. Sh!
-[animal footsteps]

16:59.935 --> 17:00.769
[cocks gun]

17:08.694 --> 17:09.820
Shit!

17:09.903 --> 17:11.655
Well, good night.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.283
I thought I had it.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.909
Yeah, well, you missed him.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.953
He's not coming back tonight.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.415
But the good news is,
we can take a trip to the taxidermist

17:22.124 --> 17:24.418
about that 12-point bush you just killed.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.965
[Country & Western music plays on radio]

17:31.884 --> 17:33.552
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.220
I saw your note. You guys get a wolf?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.346
Nope.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.265
Thought I heard a gunshot.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.017
Oh my God, is Colt okay?

17:42.770 --> 17:43.937
How you doin'?

17:44.605 --> 17:46.440
Any luck on the job huntin'?

17:48.067 --> 17:51.153
Where am I gonna get my
"friends and family" discount?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.991
Please say Charlie's Steakhouse.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.579
Nah, they're not hiring, I checked.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.458
I went to every restaurant
within ten miles of here.

18:05.334 --> 18:09.338
Most didn't need help and those that did
seemed to be hiring waitresses more like--

18:09.421 --> 18:11.090
Fuckin' Sunshine.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.888
You think I should do somethin'
different with my hair?

18:17.971 --> 18:20.349
A lot of women are putting in
these fun highlights,

18:20.432 --> 18:22.768
y'know, like blue and pink streaks.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.898
I think that's a question for Abby.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.819
Or better yet, Colt.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.614
I'm serious.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.533
I feel like I need a change.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.618
You look great.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.080
Stop thinkin' about this job thing.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.040
It's only the first day.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.960
You remember Sue Miller
who got fired from the Safeway?

18:48.043 --> 18:49.920
She looked for a job for six months,

18:50.003 --> 18:52.506
and then had to end up
movin' in with her daughter.

18:53.048 --> 18:56.343
Now she tells me
she just has the best job in the world,

18:56.426 --> 18:58.220
"full-time grandma."

19:01.515 --> 19:05.018
Bullshit, Sue. I see you poppin' Xannies
like Skittles.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.441
Maybe you oughta look for something
other than waitin' on tables.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.486
I could talk to Glen
down at the feed store.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.572
God knows he needs help.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.615
He's always out of baling wire

19:18.699 --> 19:21.368
but he's got plenty
of fuckin' Charleston Chews.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.746
I don't know, maybe.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.792
Are you okay?

19:30.502 --> 19:31.753
Well, what if this is it?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.006
What if nobody ever hires me again

19:34.089 --> 19:36.341
'cause they just see a useless, old woman?

19:37.634 --> 19:38.927
That's not who you are.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.596
Well, I know that.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.598
What if nobody else ever does?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.602
I can't afford to stop working.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.856
You know how much money
I have in my savings account?

19:51.690 --> 19:52.733
Six hundred dollars.

19:54.193 --> 19:58.363
That's all I have to show
for a lifetime of work. $600, Beau.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.992
Times are always tough.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.077
But you'll get through this.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.455
And in the meantime...

20:07.539 --> 20:08.665
I can help you out.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.045
Did you seriously just offer me a handout?

20:13.128 --> 20:15.589
No, but I know you need help

20:15.672 --> 20:18.217
and I've got money to spare, I could...

20:19.509 --> 20:22.054
Jesus Christ,
I sound like a fuckin' Democrat.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.687
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.607
I mean, even if I had more savings,
I wouldn't wanna stop workin'.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.025
It gives me a sense of purpose.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.321
You're gonna keep on lookin'
until you find a job you deserve.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.074
And in the meantime,

20:42.157 --> 20:43.951
we're gonna go down
to the Cracker Barrel

20:44.034 --> 20:46.912
and siphon all the gas
out of Sunshine's car.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.503
[inhales] It's electric.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.132
Fuckin' Sunshine.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.766
Hey, Colt.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.559
Oh, shit.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.356
Hiya-- Oh, shit, look at that uniform.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.527
Whoa. What happened to Garrison's finest?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.154
Going to sheriff's department now?

21:21.238 --> 21:25.158
That's good news. That means I can drink
and drive anywhere I want in the county.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.787
Wow, look at that. When'd you start?

21:28.870 --> 21:29.788
Yesterday.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.040
I was lucky there was an openin'.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.793
I mean, the guys in the department
are all still grievin',

21:34.876 --> 21:36.545
but for me, it's awesome.

21:38.171 --> 21:41.091
Yeah, I heard about that accident
at the gun range.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.926
Congratulations, man.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.015
So, I got your text.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.599
What's this favor you need?

21:49.683 --> 21:50.600
Yeah.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.771
I was just wonderin', how long
does Rooster have to be missin'

21:54.855 --> 21:56.606
before you put an APB out on him?

21:56.690 --> 21:58.233
Oh, come on, man.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.861
Last time you had me do that,
it was so that we barge in on him

22:00.944 --> 22:02.446
banging Pregnant Linda.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.364
[Colt chuckles]

22:04.448 --> 22:07.492
Still watch that body-cam footage
every Christmas.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.453
Well, this...

22:10.037 --> 22:11.204
This is serious.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.707
He's been gone for a day and a half.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.001
His bike's missing,
he won't return my texts.

22:16.084 --> 22:18.628
You didn't return my text
for, like, a week and a half

22:18.712 --> 22:20.672
when I invited you
to my Fourth of July BBQ.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.552
That was different. I was waitin' to see
if somethin' better come along.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.180
It did, too.

22:28.263 --> 22:31.183
Abby's cousin, she's got a houseboat
on Lake Powell.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.227
Chugged a whole bottle of Fireball.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.313
Shot Roman candles out of it.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.067
Eddie Braun almost lost a finger.

22:41.401 --> 22:44.696
Well, we had a slip and slide,
so f-u-u-uck you.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.120
It's not that unusual, Rooster being gone.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.622
Yeah. I know.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.540
Just...

22:57.334 --> 23:00.545
There was some shady shit going on
with Mary's ex, Nick.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.214
Yeah, that guy's bad news.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.052
Y'know, he threatened to kill Rooster
before he left town.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.762
He didn't leave town.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.306
What?

23:11.681 --> 23:13.183
I saw him today.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.477
He lives in that trailer park
down Butterfield Road,

23:15.560 --> 23:17.604
next to the old guy
who looks like Richard Petty.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.483
He's still here.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.442
Yeah.

23:22.984 --> 23:26.113
He'll sign a 43 STP photo
for a big bag of potatoes.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.074
No, Nick.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.661
That means he was in town
when Rooster disappeared.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.414
Fuck it, I'm goin' down there.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.665
-No, you're not.
-[keys jingle]

23:37.374 --> 23:40.293
I will run Rooster's plates
and then I'll go see Nick, okay?

23:40.377 --> 23:42.045
You stay here. I got this.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.466
Yeah, all right.
[fidgets with keys]

23:46.842 --> 23:49.010
Just give me a call
if you find out anythin', all right?

23:49.094 --> 23:50.053
I will.

23:52.013 --> 23:55.100
You promise he's not just naked
at Pregnant Linda's house right now?

23:56.476 --> 23:57.519
He's not.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.063
Y'know what? You should go check.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.566
Hey.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.651
Turn on that body cam, just in case.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.993
What we got goin' on here?

24:13.076 --> 24:14.494
Hey.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.371
Well, I noticed we needed some firewood

24:16.455 --> 24:17.914
so I grabbed an ax,

24:17.998 --> 24:19.916
pictured Sunshine, and started choppin'.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.546
I'm not saying
I'm ready to sit in her section,

24:24.629 --> 24:26.423
but I worked out a few issues.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.844
You can get rid of a lot of anger
with hard work.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.597
I must have chopped five cords of wood

24:33.680 --> 24:36.141
the year Clinton and Gore
carried Colorado.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.895
Y'know you didn't have to do this.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.481
Well, I see work needs to be done,
I'm gonna do it.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.234
Besides, I gotta stay busy.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.862
Otherwise, it's just a matter of time
before I hop in my truck

24:48.945 --> 24:51.281
and turn that Cracker Barrel
into a drive-thru.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.367
Well, I appreciate the help.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.620
Plenty of work to do around here.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.415
Only reason I agreed to have kids
was for the cheap labor.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.836
Well, y'know, until I find a new job

25:04.920 --> 25:06.922
I'll be happy to help you out around here.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.925
I'm not sayin' I can do as much
as Colt and Rooster, but...

25:10.008 --> 25:12.719
What am I saying?
I can do twice as much in half the time.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.305
Yeah, and you'd be sober.

25:15.388 --> 25:16.598
Ish.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.602
Well, if you're gonna help me out,
I'm gonna have to pay you.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.395
Yeah, no shit.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.108
People who work with me
tend not to like me too much.

25:27.192 --> 25:30.320
People who date you
tend not to like you too much.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.406
But I'm still here.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.535
Probably 'cause your house burned down.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.577
That's true.

25:38.828 --> 25:40.872
It'll help me feel useful.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.459
But if I find out you burned down my house
on purpose for the cheap labor

25:44.543 --> 25:46.002
-I'm gonna be pissed.
-[Beau chuckles]

25:47.254 --> 25:49.422
I'm not gonna give you
any special treatment.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.632
You better not.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.425
All right.

25:54.427 --> 25:56.304
This ax needs sharpenin'.

25:57.138 --> 25:59.224
And there's a file in the kitchen drawer.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.434
Good, you know what to do.
I'm gonna take a bath.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.732
[distant dog barking]

26:08.233 --> 26:09.234
Hey, Nick.

26:14.531 --> 26:15.448
Colt.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.122
[insects chirping]

26:23.707 --> 26:25.208
What happened with you and my brother?

26:27.627 --> 26:29.588
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.010
Just cut the bullshit, all right?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.766
Rooster's gone.
All of a sudden you're back?

26:42.559 --> 26:43.518
He's gone?

26:44.728 --> 26:46.563
Well, shoot, that is just too bad.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.648
But like I told you...

26:49.441 --> 26:50.942
I don't know anything about it.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.620
Where's my brother?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.582
Look, Colt, I like you.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.375
You're a good guy.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.170
And me and you ain't got a problem.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.090
So don't make one.

27:16.926 --> 27:18.845
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.848
Where's my brother?

27:25.810 --> 27:27.937
The only thing I know
about your brother...

27:28.647 --> 27:31.149
is he likes to fuck
other guys' girlfriends.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.944
And that could get a man in trouble.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.663
-[Colt yells]
-[Nick shouts]

27:45.330 --> 27:47.332
[dogs barking]

27:49.918 --> 27:50.919
[Colt] Fuck!

27:54.964 --> 27:56.466
[both groan with effort]

28:02.389 --> 28:03.682
[groaning continues]

28:04.057 --> 28:05.016
