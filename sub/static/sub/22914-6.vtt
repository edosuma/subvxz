00:07.220 --> 00:07.860
- Previously on "Happy"...

00:08.690 --> 00:10.190
- You're not real.

00:10.230 --> 00:12.600
- I'm Hailey's imaginary friend.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.630
- I have never seen
a room of young faces

00:14.660 --> 00:18.140
in such dire need of correction.

00:18.170 --> 00:21.170
- I need to know
who killed my Mikey.

00:21.210 --> 00:23.140
- You have an enemy
in your house.

00:23.170 --> 00:25.210
who killed your son.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.280
Mikey is not with them.

00:28.310 --> 00:30.210
Hey, Amanda.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.680
She's my daughter.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.250
- Look at the dumpster fire
that your life has become,

00:33.280 --> 00:36.120
and ask yourself how
I could rely on you.

00:36.150 --> 00:38.190
Get out.

00:38.220 --> 00:39.690
- What're you doing?
Get off the tracks.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.490
- You were the one with her
when she was kidnapped.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.130
- If you want me to go, fine.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.630
- Music to my ears, bye-bye.

00:45.660 --> 00:46.660
- Good-bye, partner.

00:48.370 --> 00:50.300
- Happy.

00:50.330 --> 00:52.470
Ah shit, I killed my kid's
imaginary friend.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.510
- She's one of my best men.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.440
- Blue!

00:58.480 --> 00:59.480
- Blue?

01:01.350 --> 01:03.410
- Shit's just getting
weirder and weirder.

01:04.709 --> 01:07.350
- My name is Happy.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.550
I'm an imaginary friend.

01:09.590 --> 01:12.620
And... no one believes in me.

01:12.660 --> 01:14.620
We believe in you.

01:14.660 --> 01:17.260
- Sorry, I just...

01:17.290 --> 01:19.630
I never thought I'd end up
somewhere like this.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.200
No offense.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.170
- None of us did, little fellow.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.700
The thing to remember is...
this wasn't your fault.

01:26.740 --> 01:30.740
- Right, well, that's nice.
You're all very nice.

01:30.770 --> 01:32.380
But it is my fault.

01:32.410 --> 01:35.350
She believed in me
and I failed, I...

01:35.380 --> 01:38.480
Look at me,
I'm fading away, I...

01:38.520 --> 01:40.350
My color, my coat.

01:40.380 --> 01:43.520
I used to be as blue as a
blueberry snow cone and now I...

01:43.550 --> 01:45.520
- You're still very blue.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.560
- Ah, there are millions of IFs
out there just like you, Happy.

01:49.590 --> 01:51.730
- Waiting for the moment
our young friends

01:51.760 --> 01:54.260
stop believing completely.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.730
- And we blink out of existence.

01:56.770 --> 01:59.770
- I knew this day would come,
I just...

01:59.800 --> 02:02.240
I didn't think it
would be so soon.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.680
- We have to learn to let go,
whenever they let go.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.680
- That's what it means
to be an IF.

02:08.710 --> 02:13.250
- Now or later,
we're destined for nothingness.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.520
- There's so much more for
Hailey and I to do.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.820
There's so many games, I...

02:17.850 --> 02:20.590
Aw.
Her first date.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.190
- Hah!
- Peep.

02:22.230 --> 02:23.690
Something you'd like to share?

02:23.730 --> 02:25.360
- Why, yes.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.570
It's not monsters under
the bed; it's penises.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.640
Great, big, nasty penises.

02:33.670 --> 02:36.370
Also, fuck Judy Blume.

02:36.410 --> 02:39.540
Two weeks with those books,
now my friend's knocked up

02:39.580 --> 02:42.310
and her water's breaking
in Algebra I.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.750
- Was it "Freckle Juice"?

02:52.720 --> 02:54.660
- Hello, friend.

02:54.690 --> 02:58.260
- Just one marshmallow?
They're free, you know.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.630
- I only deserve one.

02:59.660 --> 03:02.270
And only because it's not
hot chocolate without it.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.740
- You know, you showed real
vulnerability in there.

03:05.770 --> 03:08.510
I'm proud of you.
- Smoke?

03:08.540 --> 03:11.780
- After all the cocaine I had
this week, I don't think so.

03:12.740 --> 03:14.610
- Well, don't look so glum.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.480
The world is losing
its imagination, Happy.

03:17.510 --> 03:20.750
There were times I felt
we were all that's left.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.890
A dying breed.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.460
But then, I found a new friend.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.460
- A... a new friend?

03:27.490 --> 03:30.760
- Yep, with enough belief
for a hundred of us.

03:30.790 --> 03:34.600
- You're not, like, one of
those guys in the bowties

03:34.630 --> 03:36.370
that rings the doorbell,
are you?

03:36.400 --> 03:39.470
- Not at all.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.740
I can't promise you sweeter
pastures than the hereafter.

03:42.770 --> 03:46.780
But I will say, if you need
some warm straw to sleep on,

03:46.810 --> 03:48.350
so to speak,

03:48.380 --> 03:49.910
you're welcome to stay with us

03:49.950 --> 03:52.450
till you get back
on your hooves.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.450
- Oh, I couldn't intrude.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.790
- Nonsense.
No trouble at all.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.790
- That is, unless you got
somewhere better to go.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.330
- God damn it, they say that
if the bullet don't get you,

04:04.360 --> 04:05.600
the fall will.

04:05.630 --> 04:07.400
But in your case,
not so much, huh?

04:07.430 --> 04:11.370
Just kinda... scrambled
your eggs real good, right?

04:11.400 --> 04:14.800
Still can't believe that
I didn't hit any vital organs.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.570
All right, maybe there's
still something

04:16.610 --> 04:17.570
rattling around in there.

04:17.610 --> 04:19.339
Now listen to me.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.310
Get your hands off that,
and listen.

04:21.350 --> 04:23.480
Now, when I shot you, you were
trying to give me a password.

04:23.510 --> 04:24.550
Right?

04:24.580 --> 04:25.780
- Blue.
- So I... yeah.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.750
Now, I didn't want the password.

04:27.780 --> 04:30.550
I couldn't give two shits, but
now circumstances have changed.

04:30.590 --> 04:32.790
So, I want it, right?
- Blue.

04:32.820 --> 04:35.890
- Yeah, so I need you
to dig down deep inside,

04:35.930 --> 04:39.430
and just come on up
with that password, pal.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.570
I know you got it in you.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.500
So just give it to me.

04:43.530 --> 04:45.740
You son of a...
I justified breaking the bones

04:45.770 --> 04:47.440
of a handicap.

04:47.470 --> 04:49.710
- Now you're gonna
give me that password.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.680
Jesus Christ!

04:58.680 --> 05:02.550
- Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas.
Ho ho ho ho.

05:05.390 --> 05:08.660
Ho ho ho ho ho.
Merry Christmas.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.630
- Oh, jeez, look at that shit.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.770
- Ho ho ho ho ho.
Merry Christmas.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.600
Ho ho ho ho ho.

05:25.410 --> 05:26.840
- Put your leg in the pant hole,

05:26.880 --> 05:28.780
or I'll cut it off and
stuff it in there for you.

05:28.810 --> 05:29.950
- Pardon me.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.920
May the church be of service?

05:31.950 --> 05:33.920
- Ah, Father,
thank God you're here.

05:33.950 --> 05:39.520
I... ah, this poor soul
is an immigrant.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.460
Uh, barely speaks English, uh...

05:41.490 --> 05:44.890
and he's looking for sanctuary.

05:44.930 --> 05:47.000
- Blue.
- Yeah, poor little kitten.

05:47.030 --> 05:48.770
He fell out a window.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.900
Kinda cracked his melon,
you know, so...

05:51.940 --> 05:53.940
mentally he's...

05:53.970 --> 05:55.040
not all there.

05:55.070 --> 05:56.470
- Bless you, my chi...

05:56.510 --> 05:58.510
- Yeah, and, uh, I mean,

05:58.540 --> 06:00.710
you know what the state
of affairs is these days

06:00.740 --> 06:01.850
for illegals.
- Excuse me?

06:01.880 --> 06:03.510
I have my green card.

06:03.550 --> 06:04.610
- Yeah, well, look,
I don't care which strings

06:04.650 --> 06:05.950
the Vatican pulled for you.

06:05.980 --> 06:08.650
I'm glad you're here,
but you know, the kid here...

06:08.690 --> 06:11.820
There's some not nice people
looking for him.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.990
And I'm not talking about
immigration, either, so...

06:14.020 --> 06:18.060
I mean, you know, his only hope
is to... to find sanctuary here.

06:18.090 --> 06:20.760
- You are all God's children
under this roof, but...

06:20.800 --> 06:22.670
- You're goddamned right.
I say that all the time.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.570
And if I had a dime every time
that came out of me, I'd...

06:25.600 --> 06:27.900
Eh, it doesn't... but anyway,

06:27.940 --> 06:30.640
so what you could do for me is,
uh, maybe babysit him,

06:30.670 --> 06:32.080
for a while.

06:32.110 --> 06:35.950
Uh, while I run a... an Old
Testament type errand,

06:35.980 --> 06:38.620
if you know what I mean.

06:38.650 --> 06:40.550
Yeah, I... look,
I know how this looks.

06:40.580 --> 06:42.050
It may seem, like,
a bit extreme,

06:42.090 --> 06:43.990
a little San Quentin Old Sparky.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.990
"Mama! I'm coming to you."
Oh, that's serious stuff, but...

06:47.020 --> 06:48.760
It's not, he likes it.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.960
It's very, uh, kinda safe
and secure,

06:50.990 --> 06:53.900
like a newborn baby,
being swaddled.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.870
Because trust me, I mean,
you don't do it,

06:55.900 --> 06:57.970
and this kid before you know
it, he'll be running naked

06:58.000 --> 07:00.940
outside into the street
through your doors, and...

07:00.970 --> 07:02.840
I think you and I can agree

07:02.870 --> 07:04.540
that church doesn't need a
scandal like that on its hands,

07:04.570 --> 07:05.810
right?

07:05.840 --> 07:07.710
- I suppose it's
for his own safety.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.610
- Ah, his own safety!
Move your fucking leg.

07:09.650 --> 07:11.550
- Blue.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.820
- All right there, uh, then,
Mikey, we'll see you later.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.590
Take care, buddy.
I'll be back for you soon.

07:16.620 --> 07:18.820
- Blue.

07:18.860 --> 07:22.590
- All right.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.770
How's that working out for you?

07:30.900 --> 07:33.100
- Prayer?

07:33.140 --> 07:37.040
- Well, talking to things
that ain't there, you know.

07:37.070 --> 07:39.010
Does He ever talk back?

07:39.040 --> 07:41.010
- Every day.

07:41.040 --> 07:46.620
No matter how dark it gets, He
finds a way to show His light.

07:49.120 --> 07:53.620
- Man, I used to have
one of those.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.990
- How long will you be?

07:58.030 --> 08:01.630
- Long enough to extract
my pound of flesh.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.640
- Blue.

And I think if you look at my
face, I'm not playing.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.150
- Nicholas.

10:29.180 --> 10:33.120

- That is right.

11:20.830 --> 11:24.330
- So what's my ten cents?

11:24.370 --> 11:25.770
- How's that?

11:25.800 --> 11:28.910
- Well, the girl is
the cup of lemonade;

11:28.940 --> 11:31.810
so, what's my ten cents?

12:13.380 --> 12:16.320
- Everything you say
in here is confidential.

12:16.350 --> 12:18.420
The only one listening is God.

12:18.450 --> 12:20.460
- Blue.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.190
- As the Book of John
tells us...

12:23.230 --> 12:25.530
We are not to live in shame
over what we once were,

12:25.560 --> 12:28.360
but to celebrate
the grace of God,

12:28.400 --> 12:31.200
that by the death of Jesus,
regenerates us

12:31.230 --> 12:33.800
and cleanses us from our...
- Peccatorum.

12:37.910 --> 12:43.850
- That's right.
Our sins.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.880
You know Latin?

12:46.920 --> 12:50.320
- And are you prepared
to confess your sins?

12:50.350 --> 12:53.890
- Siciliam sanguis.

12:55.390 --> 12:58.260
- Tell me everything, my son.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.460
- Best news ever all day.

13:35.100 --> 13:40.570
So it seems that somebody's
father used to be a policeman.

13:45.510 --> 13:48.010
Not a very good policeman.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.910
Not a very smart one.

13:49.950 --> 13:54.450
But a big, stinky, sweaty pig.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.590
Does that ring a bell
for anybody?

13:56.620 --> 13:57.950
No?

13:57.990 --> 13:59.520
Great.
This is gonna be fun.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.490
Everybody please put
your hands out on the desk.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.360
Yeah.
Hands out, flat.

14:03.390 --> 14:04.660
There we go, hands out.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.330
- Ow.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.660
- Ooh, Hailey.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.500
Hailey.

14:10.530 --> 14:14.340
- Whoever it is should say so.
You'll get us all in trouble.

14:14.370 --> 14:15.940
- No one likes a snitch.

14:17.670 --> 14:20.340
Don't ever step on my scene.

14:20.380 --> 14:23.980
So if Hailey steps forward
right now

14:24.010 --> 14:26.050
she gets to go home.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.020
This is a limited time offer.

14:28.050 --> 14:29.320
Hmm.

14:29.350 --> 14:32.020
Do you understand?

14:32.060 --> 14:33.560
- Me.
I'm Hailey.

14:36.430 --> 14:40.300
- Oh. Look at you.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.030
You must get teased a lot.

14:42.070 --> 14:44.630
You look like Little Orphan
Annie on mood suppressants.

14:45.570 --> 14:49.410
But you're not an orphan,
are you?

14:50.570 --> 14:52.140
- No.
- Right.

14:52.180 --> 14:53.680
Takes one to know one.

14:53.710 --> 14:57.150
So all you have to do is answer
a simple question

14:57.180 --> 14:59.120
and you're free to go.
Sound good?

15:00.420 --> 15:01.420
Excellent.

15:01.450 --> 15:03.390
Hailey,

15:03.420 --> 15:08.090
what is your father's name?

15:21.370 --> 15:24.540
- Nick!
My dad's name is Nick.

15:24.570 --> 15:26.940
Leave her alone.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.050
- I saw it in your eyes.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.590
Right from the start.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.460
Hailey.

15:39.490 --> 15:42.390
I'm afraid I have
some awful news.

15:42.430 --> 15:44.490
Your father is dead.

15:45.730 --> 15:47.700
That's right.

15:47.730 --> 15:50.130
Nick Sax has gone off to the

15:50.170 --> 15:54.000
big Assholes Anonymous meeting
in the sky.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.470
All your dreams of tickle
fights and shoulder rides...

15:57.510 --> 15:58.570
poof!

16:01.610 --> 16:04.480
There's no white knight
coming to save you.

16:04.510 --> 16:06.120
No happily ever after.

16:06.150 --> 16:08.180
This is the real world.

16:08.220 --> 16:11.650
The scrap yard
of childish things.

16:15.590 --> 16:17.760
- Mmm.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.210
- Hailey.

16:30.670 --> 16:33.440
- Hey, now,
I know what you're thinking.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.080
Hailey's gone
and forgotten about you.

16:36.110 --> 16:38.780
But what did I tell everyone
in the group tonight?

16:38.810 --> 16:42.750
Our lives are connected by a
thousand invisible threads.

16:42.790 --> 16:45.420
And along these
sympathetic fibers,

16:45.450 --> 16:49.530
our actions run as causes
and return to us as results.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.260
- That means nothing in life
is by chance.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.060
Nothing is coincidence.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.660
- Fate is real.

16:55.700 --> 16:58.100
Let that thought give you
some measure of comfort

16:58.130 --> 17:00.770
in the coming hours and days.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.440
- I don't understand any
of what you just said.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.670
But it did sound nice.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.540
- Have faith.

17:06.579 --> 17:10.250
I don't want to speak too soon,
but once you meet my friend,

17:10.280 --> 17:12.250
you may have found your future.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.720
- Hailey is the only
real friend I've ever known.

17:14.750 --> 17:19.160
I tried making another one,
but it didn't work out so good.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.660
Di... did you hear that?

17:25.690 --> 17:27.230
- Uh, no, I didn't.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.170
- But, you know what I do hear?

17:30.530 --> 17:33.470
- He's home.
He's home.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.800
- For the love of God, woman,
shut up!

17:42.910 --> 17:44.480
- Blue.

17:49.550 --> 17:52.560
Blue.

17:53.260 --> 17:55.590
Blue.

17:55.620 --> 17:58.730
- Ascolta

17:58.760 --> 18:03.770
la Mia parola.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.540
Ascolta...

18:08.300 --> 18:11.510
- Blue.

18:31.930 --> 18:34.330
- Gerry, this is Happy.
- Happy?

18:34.360 --> 18:36.900
- ♪ The happy horse, horse,
horse so full of fun ♪

18:36.930 --> 18:39.270
- You don't need to sing
the song.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.700
- Oh, I'm sorry.

18:41.740 --> 18:43.870
Well, I'm very pleased
to meet you.

18:43.910 --> 18:45.670
I've heard so many...

18:45.710 --> 18:47.810
- You like to play games, Happy?

18:47.840 --> 18:49.310
- Uh, games?

18:49.350 --> 18:51.910
I... I know literally
a bajillion games.

18:51.950 --> 18:54.650
What games do you have in mind?

18:58.990 --> 19:02.560
- Where is he?
- I didn't see. I didn't see.

19:06.660 --> 19:10.930
God conceals from men
the happiness of death.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.270
- What the hell does that mean?

19:15.300 --> 19:16.940
I bet if he were
a 12-year-old boy,

19:16.970 --> 19:20.710
you wouldn't have
lost track of him.

19:24.410 --> 19:26.280
What a nut job.

19:26.320 --> 19:30.820
- Ho ho ho ho ho,
Merry Christmas.

19:30.850 --> 19:33.620
Ho ho ho ho ho.

19:33.660 --> 19:37.830
Ho ho ho ho ho, Merry Christmas.

19:37.860 --> 19:40.800
Ho ho ho ho ho.

19:40.830 --> 19:45.830
Ho ho ho ho ho, Merry Christmas.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.840
- I thought roulette had a
spinning wheel with a ball.

19:50.870 --> 19:53.640
- This is the Russian kind.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.980
- Pick it up, point it at your
head, pull the trigger.

19:58.010 --> 20:01.720
- Uh, guns are dumb.
♪ They make people numb.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.720
♪ And you don't need a...
- Pick it up!

20:04.750 --> 20:07.720
- But why, Raspberry?
I thought we were friends.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.990
- But you had no friends, Happy.

20:10.030 --> 20:12.330
I thought we'd established that.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.760
You've lost Hailey, haven't you?

20:13.800 --> 20:15.900
- Pick it up!
- What's left to lose?

20:15.930 --> 20:19.340
Pick it up.

20:20.870 --> 20:22.670
Come on, Happy.

20:22.710 --> 20:25.370
- Do it.
- Pull the trigger.

20:25.410 --> 20:26.410
- Do it!

20:27.910 --> 20:29.310
Lame.

20:29.350 --> 20:32.680
- Give the gun
to Captain Pancake.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.020
- No, please.
I don't wanna die.

20:35.050 --> 20:37.850
- Give pancake the gun.

20:37.890 --> 20:39.360
- Ooh, look, Gerry,

20:39.390 --> 20:42.020
his hands are too wittle
to hold a revolver.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.970
- Ugh.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.410
- No!

20:56.440 --> 20:57.440
Ah!

20:59.810 --> 21:01.780
No.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.420
- Mom, back.

21:13.460 --> 21:14.820
Brought your new pills.

21:17.090 --> 21:19.330
It says,
"Avoid taking with milk."

21:19.360 --> 21:22.900
- Shh, shh, shh.

21:22.930 --> 21:25.900
She's sleeping.

21:29.770 --> 21:32.480
I knew your father very well.

21:32.510 --> 21:34.710
He was a top man.

21:34.740 --> 21:36.810
A reliable man.

21:36.850 --> 21:40.750
I used to think there
was some of him in you.

21:40.780 --> 21:43.850
But this girl that stands
before me

21:43.890 --> 21:46.890
would be such
a bitter disappointment to him.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.360
Nick Sax...

21:51.130 --> 21:53.360
has a kid.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.470
You knew this, and you kept
it from me.

21:57.970 --> 21:59.100
- Until a few hours ago,

21:59.130 --> 22:00.900
I had no idea kids were a part

22:00.940 --> 22:04.770
of your
ever-expanding portfolio.

22:04.810 --> 22:11.010
- If you found toenail
clippings that you even thought

22:11.050 --> 22:14.880
may have come from Sax,
you should've let me know.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.050
- From here on out, you'll be
the first person I think of

22:17.090 --> 22:19.560
when it comes to
child trafficking.

22:25.830 --> 22:28.160
- You're done.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.900
- We had a deal.

22:29.930 --> 22:31.870
I deliver Sax,

22:31.900 --> 22:35.140
and I never have
to see you again.

22:35.170 --> 22:37.970
- On the bright side,

22:38.010 --> 22:42.040
you get to spend Christmas
with your mother.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.410
Enjoy.

22:45.080 --> 22:50.050
After all,
she may not have that long.

22:52.490 --> 22:54.020
Shh.

23:06.540 --> 23:09.510
- Ah! You bleached whore.

23:09.540 --> 23:11.070
I'll put a curse on you.

23:11.110 --> 23:12.940
Pshoo.

23:12.980 --> 23:15.010
- Some thanks, I thought this
thing was gonna attack.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.850
- Hey, Isa.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.450
This strega of yours is
tracking cat hair

23:19.480 --> 23:20.920
all over the house.

23:20.950 --> 23:23.550
My fur has fur.

23:23.590 --> 23:25.490
- That sauce smells interesting.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.060
Hey, Blondie, why don't you
go see if it needs something?

23:28.090 --> 23:31.090
- Hey, bitch, I'm not
gonna be trying the sauce.

23:31.130 --> 23:34.130
- Why? You don't want mommy's
menstrual marinara?

23:34.160 --> 23:36.000
- Real talk?

23:36.670 --> 23:38.870
It's not bad.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.940
- I can't take any more of this!

23:42.970 --> 23:45.940
You running your fat, Botoxed
cannoli holes

23:45.970 --> 23:47.540
like it's any other day.

23:47.580 --> 23:49.850
We're talking about my son.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.610
My angel.

23:51.650 --> 23:54.680
Bambino prezioso.
Mio figlio.

23:54.720 --> 23:59.120
Can't you understand?
This is not some show.

23:59.150 --> 24:01.090
This is reality.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.930
- Sweetheart, you got
a hundred-year-old witch

24:03.960 --> 24:06.030
menstruating into a red sauce

24:06.060 --> 24:08.260
to bring your bambino
back from the dead.

24:08.300 --> 24:11.100
We ain't even in the same
zip code as reality.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.170
- Says the pot to the kettle.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.140
Like those things are real?

24:15.170 --> 24:17.240
- Yeah, I've gotta go with
the ladies on this one, Isa.

24:17.270 --> 24:19.270
This is starting
to scream "buzzkill."

24:19.310 --> 24:21.240
Maybe we should move on to...

24:23.150 --> 24:25.050
- He comes.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.880
He comes.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.030
- Holy shit.

24:42.700 --> 24:43.700
- Blue.

24:48.670 --> 24:51.270
- Ah!

24:53.040 --> 24:54.710
- Told you this sauce
wasn't bad.

24:54.740 --> 24:56.580
- My boy.

25:11.030 --> 25:12.830
- You son of a bitch.

25:12.860 --> 25:16.060
- Yeah, things got a little,
uh, upside down last time.

25:16.730 --> 25:18.030
- A little upside down?

25:18.070 --> 25:19.940
- Well, I think we
can both agree

25:19.970 --> 25:22.770
that things were said and done
that, uh, we both regret.

25:22.810 --> 25:25.010
- Oh, yeah.
I got regrets.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.080
- Yeah, hey, case in point.
My bad.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.610
- Damn it, Sax.

25:29.650 --> 25:31.650
There is such a thing as a code.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.050
- Ah, no, no, no.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.320
Now don't start with the honor
among scumbags shit.

25:35.350 --> 25:36.790
- Oh, yeah.

25:36.820 --> 25:40.660
I'm a scumbag.
We're all scumbags.

25:40.690 --> 25:44.930
But honor... honor, Sax.
You said it.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.660
Do you even know what it means?

25:48.930 --> 25:50.070
- I think so.
- No.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.830
No, you don't.
- Okay.

25:51.870 --> 25:54.970
- It's something you stand by.
Something you live for.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.870
Other than your
own stinking skin.

25:57.910 --> 25:59.780
- My own stinking skin?

25:59.810 --> 26:01.640
You mean, the skin that you
were gonna hand over to Blue?

26:01.680 --> 26:03.080
- Hand over to Blue.
You killed us.

26:03.110 --> 26:04.710
You killed your friends.

26:04.750 --> 26:05.880
- Technically they're
your friends.

26:05.910 --> 26:07.780
- Ah, no, no.
You cut off my finger.

26:07.820 --> 26:10.020
- I just apologized, Le dick.

26:10.050 --> 26:12.890
- There it is.
I'm just a joke to you.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.660
Le dick, Le dick, hardy har har.

26:15.690 --> 26:17.090
You know...

26:18.790 --> 26:22.100
I ain't got much, I admit that.

26:23.930 --> 26:27.670
But it's more than you got,
which is nothing.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.810
And... and, no one.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.070
- So... wait...
now you're getting personal.

26:32.110 --> 26:33.680
All you had to do was
give me my stuff

26:33.710 --> 26:34.980
and none of this
would've happened.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.910
- Ah, that's right.

26:36.950 --> 26:38.810
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

26:38.850 --> 26:41.180
That's Nick Sax
in a fucking ball sack.

26:41.220 --> 26:45.890
- Le Dic, here's the truth.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.860
I got a...

26:54.230 --> 26:58.070
- There's a kid out there.
A gir...

26:58.100 --> 27:00.200
She needs my help.
I can help her.

27:00.240 --> 27:03.840
Do you understand?
This is not about me.

27:03.870 --> 27:06.680
I can save her.

27:09.710 --> 27:11.450
I mean, maybe this is the
moment that I can stand

27:11.480 --> 27:15.080
for something other
than just my own skin.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.850
I don't have to just bring
chaos and destruction

27:17.890 --> 27:20.460
and violence wherever I touch.

27:22.990 --> 27:25.990
And all I need
in order to do that

27:26.030 --> 27:30.130
is just an
Itsy Bitsy smidge of C4.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.430
- Oh.

27:32.470 --> 27:35.040
Good.
So...

27:35.070 --> 27:38.840
you honestly are pretending
you're some kind of a hero?

27:38.870 --> 27:40.980
Seriously?

27:41.010 --> 27:43.080
'Cause...

27:44.480 --> 27:47.020
You don't save things, Sax.

27:47.050 --> 27:49.680
You kill things.

27:53.860 --> 27:55.020
- I can do with the dynamite,

27:55.060 --> 27:57.130
if that's easier
on the bottom line.

27:58.290 --> 27:59.900
Come on, work with me here.

27:59.930 --> 28:02.800
Hey... hey, I could pay you.
I could pay you.

28:02.830 --> 28:05.100
Hey, what?
What's that?

28:05.130 --> 28:06.740
- My own money.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.170
- You made me play.

28:10.170 --> 28:12.470
Come on.

28:12.510 --> 28:15.480
- Lock up on your way out.

28:17.910 --> 28:20.850
Merry Christmas.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.190
- What happened to you?

28:30.930 --> 28:32.060
Picked you up at one
of the meetings, huh?

28:32.090 --> 28:33.100
Raspberry?

28:33.130 --> 28:34.500
- He said he was my friend.

28:34.530 --> 28:35.900
- That's what he does.

28:35.930 --> 28:38.170
Preys on us at our
most vulnerable.

28:38.200 --> 28:42.270
Promises a new life, something
to fill the emptiness.

28:42.300 --> 28:46.880
- Warm straw to sleep on.

28:46.910 --> 28:49.880
- Get off on torture,
them two... him and the boy.

28:49.910 --> 28:51.780
When they're done,
they pin you up here

28:51.810 --> 28:53.080
until they settle on
killing you,

28:53.120 --> 28:56.850
or your friend
stops needing you.

28:56.890 --> 28:59.250
- And... and you just
blink away.

29:01.060 --> 29:02.830
No, it's no use.

29:02.860 --> 29:04.130
I'm a goner.

29:05.930 --> 29:09.160
Like sand through an hourglass.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.870
Listen, kid,
if you make it out of here,

29:11.900 --> 29:16.240
tell Jamie Sue, Goose the Toad
died thinking of her.

29:16.270 --> 29:18.970
- Okay.
- Now, kiss me.

29:23.310 --> 29:26.210
I see lily pads.

29:30.150 --> 29:31.390
- Ah!

29:35.160 --> 29:37.290
- Yo!

29:39.160 --> 29:41.360
- Ow, ow, ow!

29:41.400 --> 29:45.230
Ow!

29:57.210 --> 29:59.850
- I'm sorry about your dad.

30:01.180 --> 30:05.990
- You were right.
Nobody's coming to rescue us.

30:06.020 --> 30:07.860
Can't count on anyone but us.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.910
I've got a plan.

30:30.980 --> 30:33.320
It leads outside.
And it's not locked.

30:33.350 --> 30:35.220
We split up.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.320
Once we're outside, there's no
way they can catch us all.

30:37.350 --> 30:38.990
- What a great idea.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.020
Then we can all
end up like your dad.

30:45.990 --> 30:49.030
- I know you're scared.
I am too.

30:49.060 --> 30:51.370
But if we stay here,
nothing good happens.

30:52.970 --> 30:54.470
- The door is locked.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.370
- Well, I guess that settles it.

31:04.050 --> 31:05.280
- Coming through.

31:09.150 --> 31:10.990
- Follow me.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.650
Come on, let's go.
Quick.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.360
- Shh. Quiet.
- What?

31:22.400 --> 31:23.470
- What is this?

31:32.240 --> 31:34.380
- Hailey.
What do we do?

31:40.280 --> 31:44.990
- Who told you
you could leave your seats?

31:45.020 --> 31:47.190
Ugh, first it was Grandma duty,
and now this.

31:47.220 --> 31:50.490
Listen,
I'm not allowed to kill you.

31:50.530 --> 31:53.730
You're gifts, okay?
You've been promised.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.430
But that doesn't mean
I can't hurt you.

31:56.460 --> 31:58.400
It'll be like going
to the dentist.

31:58.430 --> 32:02.240
Only so much worse.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.140
- Run!

32:09.740 --> 32:11.010
- Go!

32:11.050 --> 32:13.250
- Split up.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.740
- Did I wake you?

32:43.580 --> 32:45.480
- Nicholas.

32:45.510 --> 32:48.180
- I see your better half is in
residence, like we discussed.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.480
Where's your kid?

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
- Oh, he's here.

32:50.550 --> 32:52.490
- Yeah, he is, isn't he?

32:52.520 --> 32:54.560
You wouldn't hesitate for
a second to put your kid

32:54.590 --> 32:56.790
in the line of fire to get what
you want, would you?

32:56.820 --> 32:58.260
- Mm.

32:58.290 --> 33:00.200
Oh, Sax the high and mighty.

33:00.230 --> 33:01.460
- Yeah.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.100
- Well, it doesn't
quite suit you,

33:03.130 --> 33:05.330
so why don't we
get down to business?

33:05.370 --> 33:08.040
- Where's Hailey?

33:08.070 --> 33:09.340
- Where's Mikey?

33:13.140 --> 33:15.780
- In the trunk.

33:15.810 --> 33:17.510
- Gentleman, open the trunk.

33:17.550 --> 33:19.380
- Aw! No, no, no.

33:19.410 --> 33:22.150
Now, Blue, I'm shocked.
Stop it.

33:22.180 --> 33:23.520
All right, so I'm not so
shocked.

33:23.550 --> 33:25.790
You know, I kinda thought that
we would have company,

33:25.820 --> 33:29.190
so I bought Mikey
a whole new set of duds.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.630
Just for the occasion.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.490
Including a bomb vest.

33:32.530 --> 33:35.230
Anyone wanna guess
what this is then?

33:35.260 --> 33:37.170
Anybody?
It's my own design.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.630
You didn't know I was
this handy, did you?

33:38.670 --> 33:40.240
- No

33:40.270 --> 33:42.370
- I let go of my finger,
and well,

33:42.400 --> 33:44.240
there goes the neighborhood.

33:44.270 --> 33:45.610
Including your
precious password,

33:45.640 --> 33:47.380
and if you gave two shits,
your wife and kid.

33:47.410 --> 33:48.640
Now...

33:51.110 --> 33:53.350
somebody's gonna bring
my daughter to me

33:53.380 --> 33:56.580
right the fuck now.

33:56.620 --> 34:00.420
My hand is getting awful crampy.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.400
- Mikey is not in the trunk,
Nick.

34:11.130 --> 34:15.170
- Well, I'm not sure what could
possibly make you say that.

34:18.540 --> 34:21.340
Aw, fuck.

34:24.150 --> 34:26.179
I warned you.

34:35.889 --> 34:38.690
Ah, come on.

34:48.739 --> 34:50.139
- Okay.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.409
You, you, and you... kill him.

34:52.440 --> 34:55.139
I'm gonna go welcome
my nephew back.

34:55.179 --> 34:58.610
No, no, no... not in front
of the Homeowner's Association.

34:58.650 --> 35:01.350
In the garage.

35:05.590 --> 35:07.460
- I mean, that could have gonna
a little better, right?

35:15.960 --> 35:17.330
Ah!

35:18.670 --> 35:20.540
- There, there, Happy.

35:20.570 --> 35:23.570
This is only gonna hurt
a teensy bit.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.210
- Wow.

35:31.250 --> 35:34.250
That taser will sure clear
those sinuses out.

35:35.780 --> 35:37.920
- You had a pretty decent run.

35:37.950 --> 35:39.220
- More like a hobble.

35:39.250 --> 35:40.490
- Shut up.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.760
- Now, look, I know you guys
got a job to do.

35:42.790 --> 35:45.290
- No, no, no, no.
You take a moment, buddy.

35:45.330 --> 35:47.430
I mean, you only die once.

35:47.460 --> 35:48.530
- Are you fucking kidding me?

35:48.560 --> 35:51.970
- This is Nick Sax.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.400
- Well, thank you.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.940
- Just...

35:59.340 --> 36:01.410
Sometimes life
just comes at you.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.750
Like a guy with a crowbar.

36:05.780 --> 36:07.380
Ah!

36:07.420 --> 36:10.620
Or a truck with
its high beams on.

36:10.650 --> 36:12.420
You turn your head,
the light's in your face,

36:12.450 --> 36:14.990
and you say to yourself,

36:15.020 --> 36:16.490
"How the hell did I miss that?"

36:16.520 --> 36:19.430
- Shut up.

36:19.460 --> 36:21.260
- Where are the tarps?

36:22.560 --> 36:24.670
You're gonna spend all day
cleaning up your boss' garage?

36:24.700 --> 36:26.270
Repainting it?

36:26.300 --> 36:28.470
Grab some tarps,
for crying out loud.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.670
Where was I?

36:31.710 --> 36:34.010
It's just that I've been
taking stock of things.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.410
A lot, lately.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.780
It's moments like these when...

36:40.580 --> 36:42.380
you finally get it.

36:42.420 --> 36:43.690
- Right when you're
about to get it.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.820
- You got it.

36:45.850 --> 36:47.690
Irony.

36:47.720 --> 36:51.360
That's what they call it...
the irony of life.

36:52.290 --> 36:53.830
It's just...

36:53.860 --> 36:55.730
People try to tell you about
it, but do you listen?

36:55.760 --> 36:58.270
No.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.300
And then it's too late.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.640
Bam! Like an axe.

37:02.670 --> 37:04.510
Right between the eyes.

37:06.610 --> 37:11.410
I've broken every oath,
every promise, every code.

37:11.450 --> 37:12.680
I've failed...

37:15.350 --> 37:17.550
People I've never even met.

37:19.890 --> 37:23.290
I mean, hell, the only thing
that still even believes in me

37:23.330 --> 37:26.330
is my kid's imaginary friend.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.800
All I can tell you is
I'm kneeling here

37:29.830 --> 37:31.770
needing to take a piss
and all I can think is,

37:31.800 --> 37:34.440
I would love to see
that little blue hemorrhoid

37:34.470 --> 37:36.540
yapping and flapping
right in front of me.

37:36.570 --> 37:38.570
- Nick? Nick!
I'm here.

37:38.610 --> 37:41.080
Nick!
- Ooh, how sweet.

37:41.110 --> 37:43.610
He's talking to things
that ain't there.

37:53.390 --> 37:55.660
Argh!

38:03.600 --> 38:06.500
- Fate is real.

38:10.410 --> 38:12.440
Now you.

38:17.140 --> 38:19.980
- Jeez.

38:20.010 --> 38:22.020
Mom, what're you doing up?

38:22.050 --> 38:24.090
You all right?
Okay.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.850
Let's get you back to bed.

38:26.890 --> 38:31.430
- Your father... I need to say
this or I won't get it out.

38:32.030 --> 38:33.900
- You're taking your meds, Ma?

38:33.930 --> 38:37.870
- One day, some men showed up,

38:37.900 --> 38:40.870
said they wanted
to see the baby,

38:40.900 --> 38:44.370
to... to see you.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.040
They stood over the crib.

38:50.780 --> 38:54.920
I asked if they had babies.

38:54.950 --> 38:58.450
And one of them put
his hand on you.

38:58.490 --> 39:00.150
Right on your little bald head.

39:02.190 --> 39:04.660
"No,

39:04.690 --> 39:07.460
I haven't been blessed."

39:07.500 --> 39:09.830
And then he said if

39:09.860 --> 39:13.030
Daddy didn't play along,

39:13.070 --> 39:15.000
I would know what it was like.

39:19.710 --> 39:22.180
Not to be blessed.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.720
When your Dad found out,
he was furious.

39:28.750 --> 39:29.950
He...

39:29.980 --> 39:32.820
He wanted to take us away

39:32.850 --> 39:34.960
to somewhere
they wouldn't find us.

39:34.990 --> 39:36.790
We argued in the driveway.

39:36.820 --> 39:42.460
And then he drove off to
turn in his badge and his gun.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.830
That's the last time
I saw him alive.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.140
- Mom.
- Mm.

39:51.170 --> 39:54.110
Oh, God, I'm thirsty.

39:58.950 --> 40:01.820
Meredith...

40:03.120 --> 40:05.850
it's time to stop protecting me.

40:08.220 --> 40:10.990
- Ma, I've made some
bad calls in my time,

40:11.030 --> 40:14.730
but choosing to protect you
wasn't one of them.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.730
- Mm.

40:16.760 --> 40:19.970
Maybe so,

40:20.000 --> 40:23.940
but now it's time
for me to protect you.

40:23.970 --> 40:25.010
Okay?

40:28.140 --> 40:29.540
- Okay.

40:37.180 --> 40:42.020
- Those men that came to
threaten you in your crib...

40:42.060 --> 40:44.930
one was that man tonight.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.060
- Blue?

40:49.030 --> 40:51.270
The man tonight?

40:54.070 --> 40:56.600
Ma?

40:56.640 --> 40:59.140
Oh, my God.

40:59.170 --> 41:02.180
Mom?

41:02.210 --> 41:03.880
Mom.

41:03.910 --> 41:05.850
Ma.
Mom.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.850
Come on, Ma.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.250
- All right, boys.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.620
Off with the safeties.

41:10.650 --> 41:12.050
- Shut up.

41:12.090 --> 41:15.520
- Hey, Sax, Sax, uh,
you mind if I... you know.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.090
- Commemorate the moment?

41:17.120 --> 41:18.160
- Yeah, yeah, I mean,
you're a living legend.

41:18.190 --> 41:19.890
- Well, not for long.

41:19.930 --> 41:21.060
- But, uh... come on,
you know what I mean.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.060
- Yeah, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.160
- Okay, great.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.200
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

41:29.100 --> 41:31.110
- All right.
Here we go.

41:34.240 --> 41:37.240
Three, two...
- Daddy!

41:37.280 --> 41:39.180
Gerry!

41:40.620 --> 41:43.220
- Happy.
- Nick.

42:13.110 --> 42:15.350
- Oh, Hap, what happened to you?

42:15.380 --> 42:18.290
- I'm cold, Nick.

42:18.320 --> 42:21.320
- What'd you do to him,
you monster?

42:24.030 --> 42:28.000
Now, you listen to me,
you little blue jackass,

42:28.030 --> 42:31.100
the Sax family crest is two
lions holding a banner reading,

42:31.130 --> 42:33.970
"Death before intimacy."

42:34.000 --> 42:36.270
What I'm about to say
is very difficult

42:36.300 --> 42:38.010
and I'm only gonna say it once.

42:42.680 --> 42:46.010
I believe in you.

42:46.050 --> 42:49.080
- Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

42:52.050 --> 42:53.660
- What I'm saying is

42:53.690 --> 42:55.620
if you're alive,
that means Hailey's alive.

42:55.660 --> 42:59.130
So you get your
imaginary shit together,

42:59.160 --> 43:01.930
'cause you and me,
we've got a job to finish.

43:12.740 --> 43:17.280
- ♪ I was saying let me out of
here before I was even born ♪

43:17.310 --> 43:19.750
♪ It's such a gamble
when you get a face ♪

43:19.780 --> 43:22.750
♪ I belong to the
blank generation ♪

43:22.780 --> 43:26.990
♪ And I can take it
or leave it each time ♪

43:27.020 --> 43:29.390
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh
