It was unbelievable. I've never seen
anything like it.

00:11.833 --> 00:15.712
You have so much energy. When you've
got it, you've got it.

00:15.713 --> 00:19.032
I thought that was fantastic. We've
had zombies,

00:19.033 --> 00:22.232
we've have people pressing our
buzzers and now you.

00:22.233 --> 00:25.952
You've got it all. You're my
favourite act tonight.

00:25.953 --> 00:28.552
You are what this show is all about.

# And if you move real slow, I'll

Wow! Hello and welcome to the final

03:25.593 --> 03:27.593
(WILD CHEERING)

03:29.313 --> 03:32.712
What an audience! This is it.

03:32.713 --> 03:37.072
After five phenomenal semifinals, we
now have the ultimate line-up:

03:37.073 --> 03:40.472
eleven acts who are all hoping
they'll leave here tonight

03:40.473 --> 03:43.232
with a prize that will change their
life forever -

03:43.233 --> 03:47.432
Â£250,000 and a spot on the bill
at the Royal Variety Performance.

03:47.433 --> 03:50.032
(CHEERING)

03:50.033 --> 03:53.752
And we're starting with news. Huge
news.

03:53.753 --> 03:56.432
This year's wildcard act.

03:56.433 --> 04:00.192
This is an act that didn't make it
to
the semifinals first time round,

04:00.193 --> 04:03.992
but the judges have decided is
worthy of a place in the final.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.752
I can now reveal that this year's
wildcard is...

04:06.753 --> 04:08.792
(DRUMROLL)

04:08.793 --> 04:10.832
B Positive Choir!

04:10.833 --> 04:12.833
(WILD CHEERING)

04:19.113 --> 04:23.472
Very well deserved. They will be
performing later on tonight.

04:23.473 --> 04:25.512
Let's catch up with our judges.

04:25.513 --> 04:29.952
They have all spruced themselves up
this evening. You all look gorgeous.

04:29.953 --> 04:34.672
David. Use one of the steps then
you'll be normal height. I'm not
coming to you first.

04:34.673 --> 04:38.392
Simon, I want to talk to you about
the wildcard act, B Positive Choir.

04:38.393 --> 04:40.992
How tough was it for you guys to
make
your mind up?

04:40.993 --> 04:44.152
It was tough. You could argue there
were two or three more acts

04:44.153 --> 04:47.872
who could have... There was more. It
was harder than we thought.

04:47.873 --> 04:53.512
But, looking back on the tapes, they
absolutely 100% deserve to be here.

04:53.513 --> 04:55.072
(CHEERING)

04:55.073 --> 04:57.192
Um...David.

04:57.193 --> 04:59.112
Lovely to see you.

04:59.113 --> 05:03.512
Now, three of our five winners...
Yes. ..in the semifinals were
comedians.

05:03.513 --> 05:05.552
What a year for comedy on the show.

05:05.553 --> 05:10.112
Fantastic. Well, you know, a
comedian has never won Britain's Got
Talent before.

05:10.113 --> 05:13.512
So, fingers crossed it's gonna
happen this year.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.552
(CHEERING) You never know.

05:15.553 --> 05:19.032
You never know, Alesha, because it's
quite wide open tonight?

05:19.033 --> 05:22.712
It's an even playing field. That's
the way we want it. It's exciting.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.552
We can't predict it. It's anyone's
for the taking.

05:25.553 --> 05:29.392
Amanda, the standard
in the semifinals was high,

05:29.393 --> 05:33.032
but tonight they've got to go again.
They've got to raise their level
again.

05:33.033 --> 05:37.352
Yeah, they've got to raise their
level again. But what I love is what
Simon said,

05:37.353 --> 05:40.512
some people plateau, some people go
up, some people go down -

05:40.513 --> 05:42.312
so, therefore, you can never tell.

05:42.313 --> 05:46.872
Tonight I'm here to be entertained
like everybody else. (CHEERING)

05:46.873 --> 05:49.752
It's gonna be a good one. It's a
really strong final.

05:49.753 --> 05:52.432
Thank you for the moment, judges.
See
you in a bit.

05:52.433 --> 05:55.672
Let's get going with the final
of Britain's Got Talent 2018.

05:55.673 --> 05:58.872
And kicking us off tonight is the
10-year-old singer

05:58.873 --> 06:02.312
who was the judges choice on Tuesday
night's semifinal.

06:02.313 --> 06:04.313
It's Calum Courtney!

06:06.393 --> 06:08.232
(CLATTERING) Ohh!

06:08.233 --> 06:12.472
(LAUGHTER) MAN: Are you all right?
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

06:12.473 --> 06:15.473
My name is Calum, I'm 10 years old
and I'm from Essex.

06:17.433 --> 06:20.232
I started singing when I was about
five.

06:20.233 --> 06:22.672
I love singing in school but
whenever I sing

06:22.673 --> 06:26.592
I get in a lot of trouble because I
accidentally distract other people.

06:26.593 --> 06:27.832
(LAUGHS)

06:27.833 --> 06:31.912
My family are really supportive. My
brother is a very, like...

06:31.913 --> 06:34.792
Let me start that again. I've got to
think of the word.

06:34.793 --> 06:38.473
My brother is really cheeky but, no
matter what, I love him so much.

06:39.673 --> 06:42.992
# Isn't she precious?

06:42.993 --> 06:46.992
I felt really happy when I went on
to the stage for the semifinals.

06:46.993 --> 06:50.672
# She's my mum #

06:50.673 --> 06:55.112
When he's up on that stage, I feel
like the luckiest mum alive.

06:55.113 --> 06:57.952
That made me feel so proud. It makes
you just beam.

06:57.953 --> 06:59.992
Going through to the final is...

06:59.993 --> 07:01.832
Calum Courtney!

07:01.833 --> 07:05.352
I've wanted to do Britain's Got
Talent since I was four years old.

07:05.353 --> 07:07.872
So to be here is a dream come true
for me.

07:07.873 --> 07:11.392
Tonight I'm gonna go out there and
I'm gonna give it all I've got.

07:11.393 --> 07:13.392
We're out!

07:13.393 --> 07:15.393
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

07:19.673 --> 07:23.592
# Oh, sometimes

07:23.593 --> 07:26.232
# I get a good feeling, yeah

07:26.233 --> 07:29.032
# Yeah

07:29.033 --> 07:31.592
# I got a feeling

07:31.593 --> 07:34.472
# That I've never, never, never,
never

07:34.473 --> 07:36.752
# Had before, no, no

07:36.753 --> 07:39.752
# Yeah

07:39.753 --> 07:45.073
# And I just gotta tell you right
now that I

07:46.993 --> 07:52.112
# I really do believe that

07:52.113 --> 07:55.312
# Something's got a hold on me, yeah

07:55.313 --> 07:57.272
# Oh, it must be love

07:57.273 --> 07:58.672
# Oh ohh!

07:58.673 --> 08:02.032
# Something's got a hold on me right
now, child

08:02.033 --> 08:05.152
# Oh, it must be love
# Let me tell you now

08:05.153 --> 08:08.472
# I got a feeling, I feel so strange

08:08.473 --> 08:11.472
# Everything about me seems to have
changed

08:11.473 --> 08:14.392
# Step by step, I got a brand-new
walk

08:14.393 --> 08:17.512
# I even sound sweeter when I talk

08:17.513 --> 08:21.472
# I never thought this could happen
to me

08:21.473 --> 08:24.352
# Got me heavy with this misery

08:24.353 --> 08:27.392
# I never thought it would be this
way

08:27.393 --> 08:30.552
# Love's sure gonna put
a hurting on me

08:30.553 --> 08:32.472
# I said, 'Oh'
# Oh

08:32.472 --> 08:34.152
# 'Oh'
# Oh

08:34.153 --> 08:35.712
# 'Oh'
# Oh

08:35.712 --> 08:37.111
# 'Ohhh!'

08:37.113 --> 08:40.871
# I said, 'Baby, oh, it must be
love'

08:40.873 --> 08:42.751
# You know it must be love

08:42.753 --> 08:46.152
# Yeah, she walks like love
# You know, it walks like love

08:46.153 --> 08:49.112
# She talks like love
# You know, it talks like love

08:49.113 --> 08:52.392
# It makes me feel all right
# Makes me feel all right

08:52.393 --> 08:55.632
# In the middle of the night
# In the middle of the night

08:55.633 --> 08:59.192
# Na na-na na-a-a-h
# Na na-na na

08:59.193 --> 09:02.072
# Oh, yeah
# La la-la la

09:02.073 --> 09:05.792
# Oh, yeah, yeah
# Oh oh-oh oh

09:05.793 --> 09:08.513
# Oh, yeah
# Oh oh-oh oh

09:09.833 --> 09:17.312
# Yea-ea-ea-eah #

09:17.313 --> 09:19.313
(WILD CHEERING)

09:35.353 --> 09:38.032
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

09:38.033 --> 09:40.233
Alesha. Calum...

09:41.993 --> 09:45.312
..one thing I know for sure is
that you've got soul.

09:45.313 --> 09:49.352
And tonight, I feel like we got to
hear your vocals even more so,

09:49.353 --> 09:52.272
in a brilliant way, than you did in
your semifinal.

09:52.273 --> 09:56.392
You sounded confident. You performed
it confident.

09:56.393 --> 10:00.112
And it's never easy going first. You
opened the show brilliantly.

10:00.113 --> 10:02.993
Well done, my darling. Really good.
(CHEERING)

10:05.073 --> 10:09.232
Really good. When Dec asked me what
I was expecting from tonight,

10:09.233 --> 10:12.512
I said, 'Some acts go up, some go
down, some stay the same.'

10:12.513 --> 10:14.672
You went completely through the
roof.

10:14.673 --> 10:17.872
(CHEERING) I felt so relaxed
watching
you.

10:17.873 --> 10:20.792
You're a real showman. You've got so
much charm.

10:20.793 --> 10:24.272
Honestly, I would love it, I would
really love it...

10:24.273 --> 10:27.473
if the Queen saw you on the Royal
Variety Show. (CHEERING)

10:28.953 --> 10:31.192
Calum, do you have a twin brother?

10:31.193 --> 10:34.392
I don't have a twin brother, he's
only eight. He's over there.

10:34.393 --> 10:39.992
OK, well, I was asking that because
the person who performed last week

10:39.993 --> 10:44.192
was so different from the person who
performed tonight.

10:44.193 --> 10:46.272
It was like, 'I'm really quiet'

10:46.273 --> 10:50.912
six nights ago and tonight you're
like a diva. It was so much better.

10:50.913 --> 10:55.712
The vocals were so much better. The
song was so much better.

10:55.713 --> 10:58.872
And you know what - I really
genuinely mean this -

10:58.873 --> 11:02.872
you so deserve this opportunity

11:02.873 --> 11:06.512
to go on this stage in the final of
Britain's Got Talent.

11:06.513 --> 11:09.992
And you shook off the nerves. I am
so proud of you.

11:09.993 --> 11:13.912
You should feel so proud of what
you've just done. Really. (CHEERING)

11:13.913 --> 11:18.592
Good for you. Yes. Just really echo
what those guys said.

11:18.593 --> 11:22.032
What so impressed me tonight is you
came out to win.

11:22.033 --> 11:24.432
Well done. Thank you.  (CHEERING)

11:24.433 --> 11:27.512
Fantastic. Did you enjoy it? Yeah.

11:27.513 --> 11:31.592
You told me you preferred it tonight
than the semifinals. You loved it.

11:31.593 --> 11:34.912
I preferred it better. Much better.
You really went for it.

11:34.913 --> 11:37.312
To send Calum to the Royal Variety
Performance,

11:37.313 --> 11:39.232
{\an1}follow the instructions on screen,

11:39.233 --> 11:43.032
but not until we've seen the last
act

A little floss for free.

Ladies and gentlemen, Calum
Courtney!

11:47.153 --> 11:49.153

12:03.713 --> 12:06.672
You can download it on your

12:06.673 --> 12:08.512
We're gonna have a quick break

12:08.513 --> 12:12.912
but we'll be right back with
nostalgia queens The D-Day Darlings.

12:12.913 --> 12:15.993
See you in just a few minutes.

12:17.073 --> 12:18.992

12:57.003 --> 13:00.682
where all of our finalists have got
their eyes on the amazing prize -

13:00.683 --> 13:04.082
Â£250,000 and a spot on the bill
at the Royal Variety.

13:04.083 --> 13:08.042
Next up is the singing group who
made it through Monday night's
semifinal.

13:08.043 --> 13:11.882
Halfway through their performance
a lot of people started flagging -

13:11.883 --> 13:13.842
me included. (LAUGHTER)

13:13.843 --> 13:18.043
What have they got in store for us
tonight? It's The D-Day Darlings!
(CHEERING)

13:19.243 --> 13:21.803
ALL: We are The D-Day Darlings.

13:23.283 --> 13:25.642
# Rule Britannia... #

13:25.643 --> 13:29.002
Performing onstage at the semifinals
was just...amazing.

13:29.003 --> 13:31.603
It was a feeling that we will never
ever forget.

13:32.723 --> 13:37.242
To stand shoulder-to-shoulder with
veterans that have fought for our
country,

13:37.243 --> 13:39.243
just made us so proud.

13:41.563 --> 13:45.362
When we were waiting to find out if
we were through to the final,

13:45.363 --> 13:49.282
I think it's the most nervous we've
ever felt.

13:49.283 --> 13:52.762
We've got to give this to The D-Day
Darlings. (CHEERING)

13:52.763 --> 13:55.562
We did it for our country and our
country got behind us

13:55.563 --> 13:57.563
and we couldn't be happier.

13:58.803 --> 14:02.242
This year it's the
100th anniversary of World War I.

14:02.243 --> 14:04.282
We're remembering our heroes,

14:04.283 --> 14:06.962
but we're also putting it into the
new generation

14:06.963 --> 14:10.002
so that they can continue the
message of remembrance.

14:10.003 --> 14:14.602
We are so excited to be in the final
of Britain's Got Talent.

14:14.603 --> 14:18.682
When we walk out on stage tonight,
we just want to do our country proud

14:18.683 --> 14:20.683
and give it everything we've got.

14:23.403 --> 14:25.403
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:36.843 --> 14:46.362
# There'll be bluebirds over

14:46.363 --> 14:52.362
# The white cliffs of Dover

14:52.363 --> 14:54.363
# Tomorrow

14:55.683 --> 15:04.802
# Just you wait and see

15:04.803 --> 15:11.402
# The shepherd will tend his sheep

15:11.403 --> 15:17.522
# The valley will bloom again

15:17.523 --> 15:24.042
# And Jimmy will go to sleep

15:24.043 --> 15:29.242
# In his own little room again

15:29.243 --> 15:36.482
# There'll be bluebirds over

15:36.483 --> 15:42.802
# The white cliffs of Dover

15:42.803 --> 15:46.442
# Tomorrow

15:46.443 --> 15:52.803
# Just you wait and see

15:55.123 --> 16:00.602
# The shepherd will tend his sheep

16:00.603 --> 16:04.922
# The valleys will bloom again

16:04.923 --> 16:10.802
# And Jimmy will go to sleep

16:10.803 --> 16:16.522
# In his own little room again

16:16.523 --> 16:24.802
# There'll be bluebirds over

16:24.803 --> 16:31.002
# The white cliffs of Dover

16:31.003 --> 16:34.243
# Tomorrow

16:35.283 --> 16:40.003
# Just you wait

16:41.283 --> 16:44.403
# And

16:45.603 --> 16:54.282
# See #

16:54.283 --> 16:56.283
(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)

17:09.042 --> 17:11.082
Come on down, girls. Come on down.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.083
(CHEERING)

17:41.083 --> 17:43.443
Amanda. Oh!

17:44.723 --> 17:48.002
Girls, I have loved you

17:48.003 --> 17:50.322
from the minute that you walked on
stage.

17:50.323 --> 17:52.762
And I know I keep going on about
her,

17:52.763 --> 17:56.002
but everybody knows that my
grandmother is still with us.

17:56.003 --> 18:00.803
She's 97. I was trying to fix her up
with the guy that's 101. (LAUGHTER)

18:01.843 --> 18:04.002
And I know my grandmother is
watching.

18:04.003 --> 18:07.002
Her name is Ethel and,
oh, my gosh,

18:07.003 --> 18:11.442
this would be the most perfect thing
for her and for the Royal Family,

18:11.443 --> 18:13.482
if you won the Royal Variety.

18:13.483 --> 18:17.642
(CHEERING) You remind us of a
generation that one day will be lost

18:17.643 --> 18:20.562
and it's so important to keep those
memories alive.

18:20.563 --> 18:23.442
You sang it beautifully and you look
amazing.

18:23.443 --> 18:25.443
I'm really proud of you. Well done.

18:26.563 --> 18:30.522
I think you girls have done great
the whole way through this
competition,

18:30.523 --> 18:32.562
I really, really do.

18:32.563 --> 18:34.442
We always say this about acts,

18:34.443 --> 18:38.122
is that if an artist knows what
their lane, their direction is,

18:38.123 --> 18:40.242
it's so much easier for us.

18:40.243 --> 18:44.482
You have been consistently good. The
vocals and harmonies have been
great.

18:44.483 --> 18:47.842
And I think where I really
appreciate this,

18:47.843 --> 18:51.802
you've given these gentlemen and I
think there was a lady there as
well,

18:51.803 --> 18:55.202
this opportunity to stand on this
stage and...

18:55.203 --> 18:57.962
and to be appreciated for what
they've done as well.

18:57.963 --> 19:00.642
It really is important. (CHEERING)

19:00.643 --> 19:03.602
So, for all those reasons,

19:03.603 --> 19:07.642
er...I thought this was a really,
really, really amazing performance,

19:07.643 --> 19:09.162
so thank you.

19:09.163 --> 19:12.082
Yeah. It was beautiful to listen to.

19:12.083 --> 19:16.922
What I love about this act is it's a
way of saying thank you to these
wonderful veterans.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.962
We got a chance to say hello to them
just outside.

19:19.963 --> 19:22.482
And I did say thank you to all of
them one by one

19:22.483 --> 19:24.882
because we wouldn't be here without
them.

19:24.883 --> 19:29.002
And for you to take it upon
yourselves to do this wonderful
thing -

19:29.003 --> 19:32.202
to remember them, to honour
them - is fantastic.

19:32.203 --> 19:35.722
A beautiful performance and a
beautiful song. Sorry, I'm talking
too long.

19:35.723 --> 19:39.562
It's fine. The judges have said it
all. You are the most polished act.

19:39.563 --> 19:42.282
Your vocals are just perfection.

19:42.283 --> 19:46.842
We should never forget. We should
always remember. Congratulations.
Thank you!

19:46.843 --> 19:49.882
Well done, ladies. You left us with
goose bumps

19:49.883 --> 19:51.922
and feeling incredibly patriotic.

19:51.923 --> 19:55.202
How did it feel for you? It just
felt
amazing again,

19:55.203 --> 19:58.482
to be joined by the boys, the girls,
you know, our heroes.

19:58.483 --> 20:01.242
And the audience, thank you. We're
just so happy.

20:01.243 --> 20:04.562
And thank you for letting us do
this. Thank you. (CHEERING)

20:04.563 --> 20:07.722
Well done. Another wonderful
performance from you all.

20:07.723 --> 20:10.322
If you think D-Day Darlings are
this year's winner,

20:10.323 --> 20:12.802
the details of how to vote
for them are on screen.

20:12.803 --> 20:15.562
Voting doesn't
open till we've seen all 11 acts.

20:15.563 --> 20:18.122
One more time, The D-Day Darlings!

20:18.123 --> 20:20.123
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

20:27.043 --> 20:29.322
Time for a quick break, but we'll be
right back

20:29.323 --> 20:32.762
with Simon's golden buzzer act, Jack
and Tim,

20:32.763 --> 20:36.722
and a comedian who has been the
judge's worst nightmare - Robert
White.

20:36.723 --> 20:38.803
See you in a few minutes.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.584
Welcome back to Britain's Got
Talent,

20:47.585 --> 20:53.984
the final, where...we have been
joined by some very special guests.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.065
Your Royal Highnesses.
Great to see you.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.942
Thank you for coming.
Hope you are enjoying the show.

20:58.944 --> 21:01.543
Actually we have been sent a
message tonight

21:01.544 --> 21:07.175
from someone you two know very
well, Bishop Michael Curry.

21:07.177 --> 21:11.576
Hello, Britain's Got Talent. It's
a joy to bring you these greetings

21:11.577 --> 21:14.896
to all of the contestants,
to the judges,

21:14.897 --> 21:17.856
to the audience, to all
who make this possible.

21:17.857 --> 21:20.536
Thank you, thank you
for what you are doing.

21:20.537 --> 21:23.736
Thank you to the contestants who
offer yourselves

21:23.737 --> 21:27.176
and share your talent and your gifts
with the rest of us.

21:27.177 --> 21:31.096
You actually help to bring
some joy and happiness.

21:31.097 --> 21:33.576
So thank you. God bless you.

21:33.577 --> 21:39.377
God keep you and may God hold us all
in those almighty hands of love.

21:41.817 --> 21:47.656
That was quite short. I was getting
settled in. Lovely to see you both.

21:47.657 --> 21:51.456
Thank you for coming. Did you get my
wedding present?

21:51.457 --> 21:55.696
You did. You're welcome. You can
never have too many tea towels.

21:55.697 --> 21:59.856
{\an1}Our next act were the judges' choice
in Thursday night's semi-final.

21:59.857 --> 22:03.856
It's Simon's Golden Buzzer act,
Jack &amp; Tim!

22:03.857 --> 22:07.376
I'm Jack and I'm 12 years old.
I'm Tim and I'm 43.

22:07.377 --> 22:10.216
BOTH: And we are Jack &amp; Tim.

22:10.217 --> 22:14.736
It feels absolutely amazing to
be in the finals with my dad.

22:14.737 --> 22:19.776
I like performing onstage with you
to see other people's reactions
to you.

22:19.777 --> 22:23.017
That makes me feel really proud.
Tim, Jack.

22:24.937 --> 22:28.376
In the semi-finals I did feel like
a rock star for a little bit.

22:28.377 --> 22:31.617
It felt absolutely incredible.
I was speechless.

22:33.177 --> 22:36.616
We live in Norwich.
Family is really important to us.

22:36.617 --> 22:40.816
Without the closeness of what we all
have, we'd never be doing this.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.776
When I'm older,
I want to be a rock star.

22:43.777 --> 22:47.576
I hope that being on Britain's Got
Talent can make me and you

22:47.577 --> 22:52.216
go and sell out stadiums
and be on a tour. Awesome.

22:52.217 --> 22:55.616
To be in the final with my son,
it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

22:55.617 --> 23:00.776
I would love to win Britain's Got
Talent. It's what I dream about.

23:00.777 --> 23:05.336
Tonight be will probably be
the biggest night of my life

23:05.337 --> 23:09.457
and if we win it will
make it even more special.

23:10.737 --> 23:13.897
Love you. You too.
Are you ready? Yes.

23:26.417 --> 23:36.136
# Lay your head on me
As I fall to sleep

23:36.137 --> 23:39.657
# Put your arms around mine

23:40.657 --> 23:44.617
# Stay here by my side

23:46.017 --> 23:50.816
# We're the lucky ones

23:50.817 --> 23:55.976
# Only just begun

23:55.977 --> 24:00.176
# Others leave too young

24:00.177 --> 24:05.456
# We're the lucky ones

24:05.457 --> 24:15.376
# Till your eyes can't see
I'll be all you need

24:15.377 --> 24:20.376
# Put your hand in mine

24:20.377 --> 24:25.536
# Stay here by my side

24:25.537 --> 24:30.136
# We're the lucky ones

24:30.137 --> 24:34.737
# Only just begun

24:35.737 --> 24:40.576
# Others leave too young

24:40.577 --> 24:44.977
# We're the lucky ones

24:46.297 --> 24:50.696
# Promise me no matter
how the years change ya

24:50.697 --> 24:52.536
# I promise you, my eyes don't see

24:52.537 --> 24:57.096
# You're perfectly imperfect
just like you were meant to be

24:57.097 --> 25:00.376
# And all through our lives
I'll be yours

25:00.377 --> 25:06.137
# Say you will be mine

25:17.817 --> 25:22.576
# We're the lucky ones

25:22.577 --> 25:27.096
# Only just begun

25:27.097 --> 25:32.097
# Others leave too young

25:33.257 --> 25:36.897
# We are the lucky ones #

25:43.817 --> 25:45.817
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:58.657 --> 26:00.657
Well done, mate.

26:05.737 --> 26:07.737
Simon.

26:10.977 --> 26:13.176
Simon, your golden buzzer.

26:13.177 --> 26:16.296
I think I have to kick off.
Jack, Tim, what can I say?

26:16.297 --> 26:22.816
That brought back so many
amazing memories of the day I first
heard that, I thought it was magic.

26:22.817 --> 26:26.296
Now to see the two of you, in the
final, in this theatre,

26:26.297 --> 26:30.217
doing it once again, it was
fantastic, I've got to tell you.

26:33.377 --> 26:35.536
Apart from liking the song,

26:35.537 --> 26:39.536
I really like you two as well.
I think you're both brilliant.

26:39.537 --> 26:44.656
This is going to be tough tonight,
there is a lot of competition.

26:44.657 --> 26:48.176
But I think you have given yourself
a shot after that performance.

26:48.177 --> 26:50.577
I think you made the right decision.

26:51.617 --> 26:53.616
Yeah. And I think...

26:53.617 --> 26:58.056
We are all on the panel,
we are lucky enough to be parents.

26:58.057 --> 27:03.576
And it's a beautiful thing to see
this fantastic relationship
between the two of you.

27:03.577 --> 27:06.416
The beautiful music you
have made together.

27:06.417 --> 27:11.416
I'm sure parents and kids
watching at home are really
going to love that.

27:11.417 --> 27:14.337
I'm sure they will pick up the phone
for you.

27:16.017 --> 27:20.016
I'm just so happy that you get to
experience this together.

27:20.017 --> 27:23.816
That vocal's beautiful. That song
wouldn't be out of place in
Nashville.

27:23.817 --> 27:28.416
Your songwriting is brilliant.
I love everything about this act.

27:28.417 --> 27:31.857
It's just so poignant and
beautiful. Well done, guys.

27:34.097 --> 27:37.096
I said exactly the same thing
to Simon.

27:37.097 --> 27:41.216
I feel like I already know this
song. I feel like it's really
country.

27:41.217 --> 27:43.776
Nashville's great.
You need to get there.

27:43.777 --> 27:48.897
Make a nice country album
and show America what Brits can do.
You were fantastic.

27:51.897 --> 27:53.736
Thank you, Amanda.

27:53.737 --> 27:58.056
You look emotional tonight.
Totally. Yeah,  it's  um...

27:58.057 --> 28:03.896
We came here with a song and a dream
and no expectations

28:03.897 --> 28:08.976
so to stand here with the rest of
these tonight. It's amazing.

28:08.977 --> 28:11.016
How do you feel, Jack?

28:11.017 --> 28:19.177
It's kind of hard to put into words
how kinda awesome it is.

28:20.737 --> 28:25.937
All the judges' comments are awesome
but the crowd is just the best.

28:27.817 --> 28:31.816
It's everything. Well done.

28:31.817 --> 28:34.616
If you want to see Jack &amp; Tim at
the Royal Variety Performance,

28:34.617 --> 28:37.176
the details on how to vote
for them are on screen now

28:37.177 --> 28:40.656
but don't vote yet. Voting doesn't
open until we've seen all the acts.

28:40.657 --> 28:43.656
One more time, let's hear it.
Jack &amp; Tim.

28:43.657 --> 28:45.657
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:52.017 --> 28:55.416
Next up is the comedian,
who won Wednesday's semi-final.

28:55.417 --> 28:59.936
Every single time we have seen him,
he has slagged off the judges
something rotten.

28:59.937 --> 29:03.296
Personally, I don't think it's
funny.

29:03.297 --> 29:06.056
I think it's absolutely hilarious!

29:06.057 --> 29:09.536
More of that, please.
It's Robert White.

29:09.537 --> 29:13.816
My name is Robert White, I am 41
years old. And I am from Sussex.

29:13.817 --> 29:16.617
{\an1}# David Walliams is obsessed
with his heterosexual pretending

29:20.217 --> 29:23.136
I never thought I'd get to
the final of Britain's Got Talent.

29:23.137 --> 29:24.656
Robert White!

29:24.657 --> 29:27.857
I was totally shocked.
I wouldn't have voted for me!

29:29.617 --> 29:34.736
I have been doing comedy for 13
years, but last September I gave up
to become a teacher.

29:34.737 --> 29:39.497
The reason I did this was to prove
to my mum that I had tried
everything.

29:40.577 --> 29:44.296
Now people are saying
that they actually think I'm funny,

29:44.297 --> 29:49.456
{\an1}which is very very nice. I had a lot
of nice messages on social media.

29:49.457 --> 29:51.936
"OMG. I absolutely love
Robert White.

29:51.937 --> 29:55.816
I hope he is in the finals,
just a brilliant act."

29:55.817 --> 29:58.176
That's from my mum.

29:58.177 --> 30:00.776
Now I'm in the final,
I need to win the show.

30:00.777 --> 30:04.296
It would prove so much to me
and it would mean so much to me.

30:04.297 --> 30:06.336
It would be like a Hollywood movie.

30:06.337 --> 30:10.216
A finale ending to a life
which has been all over the place.

30:10.217 --> 30:15.457
It would be ridiculously
overwhelming and such an honour.

30:18.697 --> 30:20.697
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

30:26.737 --> 30:30.896
Hello. Hi. Hello, thank
you, this is amazing.

30:30.897 --> 30:34.337
Thank you for having me back.
Thank you, thank you.

30:35.657 --> 30:41.056
No, it's very nerve-wracking because
I did so well the last time

30:41.057 --> 30:44.056
and there are so many amazing acts
and also it's the final

30:44.057 --> 30:48.936
and I thought my real boyfriend,
not David, was going to be here.

30:48.937 --> 30:53.577
Unfortunately he couldn't make it
due to the fact that he dumped me.

30:55.657 --> 30:57.657
In December.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.857
2010. So um...

31:01.857 --> 31:03.776
By email.

31:03.777 --> 31:05.897
It was a group email.

31:07.937 --> 31:11.976
I only do that joke cos I can
pretend I've had a boyfriend.

31:11.977 --> 31:15.896
The other reason is cos people say
I'm inspirational for autism.

31:15.897 --> 31:18.137
And it's, well...
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

31:20.857 --> 31:25.056
For those who don't know what
Asperger's syndrome is,

31:25.057 --> 31:27.657
it basically means
I am better than you.

31:31.617 --> 31:33.656
12. Um...

31:33.657 --> 31:36.057
24, 89.

31:41.097 --> 31:44.176
Also, it means for me
I am actually very good at music.

31:44.177 --> 31:47.537
I do come from a musical house.
I live in A-flat.

31:51.017 --> 31:54.456
In fact, when I was young,
my favourite instrument was this.

31:54.457 --> 31:57.856
Alesha, you're the musical one.
Tell me what this is, please.

31:57.857 --> 32:00.617
(TRUMPET-SOUNDING FANFARE)

32:03.257 --> 32:05.377
(TRUMPET-SOUNDING FANFARE AGAIN)

32:06.457 --> 32:08.496
Anyone? What instrument?

32:08.497 --> 32:10.497
Trumpet? No. It's a keyboard.

32:13.017 --> 32:14.656
Music actually helped me come out

32:14.657 --> 32:17.176
because today isn't actually
just the final.

32:17.177 --> 32:19.696
It's also the anniversary of my
coming out.

32:19.697 --> 32:21.697
(CHEERING)

32:24.057 --> 32:25.937
This time last Wednesday.

32:28.697 --> 32:32.216
People say that for the final you
should do something different,
do the same.

32:32.217 --> 32:35.776
I've done enough songs about
the panel and there is none left.

32:35.777 --> 32:40.896
So I thought I'd do a song for
specific people.

32:40.897 --> 32:45.177
I need someone who's very old.
Simon. There we go.

32:46.737 --> 32:48.376
I need two ladies. There we go.

32:48.377 --> 32:51.017
I need someone hiding
the fact he's gay.

32:59.097 --> 33:03.336
For the third and final and last
time, a song about the panel.

33:03.337 --> 33:07.376
This is to do with coming out
to my mum. Here we go.

33:07.377 --> 33:10.016
# Mum, you should have known
I was gay from my school reports

33:10.017 --> 33:12.857
# Stood for hours in the showers,
never doing sports

33:13.937 --> 33:17.297
# Drink a cup of tea, take valium,
I'm almost as gay as David

33:19.897 --> 33:22.256
# This is a song for my mum

33:22.257 --> 33:24.736
# Today, I've got a song
for your mum to follow

33:24.737 --> 33:30.017
# A song for David's mum,
your son will come out tomorrow

33:36.857 --> 33:39.456
# My mum goes, "Right, you're not
gay, gays have fashion senses

33:39.457 --> 33:41.897
# You look like Donald Trump having
a fight in Marks &amp; Spencer's

33:43.017 --> 33:45.136
# Your clothes are second hand
with a busted zipper

33:45.137 --> 33:47.897
# And all coming off
like Alesha the stripper, no

33:52.257 --> 33:56.336
# Good, that went down well, I
thought the reaction might be bad

33:56.337 --> 33:59.337
# Like that Grindr date
where I accidentally met my dad

34:02.937 --> 34:04.536
# Mum, I'm gay, I'm sorry
it's hard to take

34:04.537 --> 34:06.777
# I hide my bottom in a cake
so someone licks it by mistake

34:08.377 --> 34:10.176
# You say I should be straight
and I ruined your plan

34:10.177 --> 34:13.696
# But I can't marry Amanda Holden
even though she looks like a man

34:13.697 --> 34:15.697
(LAUGHTER)

34:17.097 --> 34:20.416
# Even though she looks like
a man...

34:20.417 --> 34:22.137
# ..da Holden

34:26.177 --> 34:28.815
# My mum goes, "Robert you are not
gay, gays dance better than you"

34:28.817 --> 34:31.377
# "When you dance you remind me of
Ann Widdecombe having a poo"

34:32.976 --> 34:35.496
# "But do you want,
there is no more waiting"

34:35.496 --> 34:38.937
# "What about Simon Cowell?
He is the perfect age for dating"

34:40.217 --> 34:42.217
# Silver Fox, how old are you?

34:43.257 --> 34:45.937
You know what? I forgot.

34:47.456 --> 34:50.176
# There we go, all old-timers

34:50.177 --> 34:52.177
# Can't remember with Alzheimer's

34:55.536 --> 34:58.536
# I've been told earlier you're 58,
that's really great

34:58.537 --> 35:01.257
# The perfect age for dating

35:02.577 --> 35:04.577
# Carbon dating

35:07.497 --> 35:09.696
# Who am I kidding?

35:09.697 --> 35:12.257
# Simon was never my favourite

35:14.857 --> 35:21.537
# The only one I ever wanted on
Britain's Got Talent was David #

35:25.697 --> 35:27.697
# I Will Always Love You

36:04.337 --> 36:06.337
Well done. Well done.

36:18.697 --> 36:23.336
I'm not sure we're going to have
many careers left after tonight.

36:23.337 --> 36:27.017
You know what,
you are such a funny man.

36:29.057 --> 36:34.176
From the other night, I don't think
I have laughed so much for years.

36:34.177 --> 36:36.977
You would be a fantastic winner of
Britain's Got Talent.

36:41.257 --> 36:46.856
You are so likeable, you are
a natural, I absolutely love you.

36:46.857 --> 36:50.496
Have you got any spare jumpers?
You are rocking them.

36:50.497 --> 36:54.176
There's about 100 on the screen.
You are insanely funny.

36:54.177 --> 36:56.617
I love everything about you.
Well done.

36:59.297 --> 37:03.656
Robert, what I love is that every
time we've see you,

37:03.657 --> 37:08.296
you have gone up and up and up the
ladder. There has been fresh jokes,
new material.

37:08.297 --> 37:11.776
You have never harked back.
It's current, it's funny.

37:11.777 --> 37:17.737
It's that thing we don't have enough
time to laugh because the one's
coming. I adore you.

37:21.457 --> 37:26.936
Robert, a lot of people I would
imagine, when making up their mind
with an act like yours,

37:26.937 --> 37:30.576
to come into the final,
"Maybe I should tone things down.

37:30.577 --> 37:34.336
Let's not be controversial."
And you have gone,

37:34.337 --> 37:38.936
"Forget that. I'll be even
more controversial and rude

37:38.937 --> 37:42.017
than I was the first time,"
and that's why I love you.

37:48.297 --> 37:51.736
You are so funny, right on
the edge in terms of

37:51.737 --> 37:57.296
{\an1}are you going to push it? And you
did. But that is why, as David said,

37:57.297 --> 37:59.897
there is a real chance
you could win this.

38:02.617 --> 38:06.457
You're my favourite from day one.
Even at our expense.

38:07.737 --> 38:11.096
If you want to send Robert to
the Royal Variety Performance,
details are on screen now

38:11.097 --> 38:14.216
but you can't vote
till the last act has finished.

38:14.217 --> 38:16.657
Ladies and gentlemen, Robert White.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.456
He's a law unto himself.
Time for a quick break now,

38:28.457 --> 38:32.056
but we'll be right back with
this year's wildcard act
B-Positive Choir

38:32.057 --> 38:36.897
and the one and only Lost Voice Guy.
See you in a few minutes.

38:43.490 --> 38:46.569
Welcome back to the final of
Britain's Got Talent.

38:46.570 --> 38:49.570
It is my last trip to the dress
circle to see everybody.

38:50.910 --> 38:53.389
I'm gonna miss you guys.
I'm gonna miss you guys.

38:53.390 --> 38:55.229
I'll get over it pretty quickly.

38:55.230 --> 39:00.470
Next up tonight are this year's
wildcard act, it's B Positive Choir.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.229
We are B Positive.

39:06.230 --> 39:09.909
We are all affected by sickle cell.

39:09.910 --> 39:11.749
That's why we are together.

39:11.750 --> 39:16.469
We want everybody to give blood.

39:16.470 --> 39:19.709
It amazes me that at least
one day a week,

39:19.710 --> 39:22.349
there is no blood
in the blood banks.

39:22.350 --> 39:26.109
Your one pint of blood
saves three lives.

39:26.110 --> 39:28.950
To me, that's astounding.
That makes you a hero.

39:38.710 --> 39:43.469
Being the judges' wildcard,
we're just so elated, exhilarated.

39:43.470 --> 39:45.589
All the -ateds
you can think about.

39:45.590 --> 39:50.429
To be part of sharing our message
on the biggest stage possible.

39:50.430 --> 39:55.030
You're not going to get
a bigger stage than Britain's
Got Talent finals.

39:57.830 --> 40:01.829
We don't just want to be IN the
final, we want to WIN the final.

40:01.830 --> 40:05.269
That's why we are so glad to have
received the wildcard.

40:05.270 --> 40:08.230
We're gonna smash it tonight.

40:11.030 --> 40:13.030
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:16.790 --> 40:20.062
# Broken down and tired of

40:20.064 --> 40:23.384
# Living a life on a merry-go-round

40:24.544 --> 40:28.303
And you can't find the fighter

40:28.304 --> 40:32.863
# But I see it in you,
so we gonna walk it out

40:32.864 --> 40:39.423
# And move mountains

40:39.424 --> 40:47.903
# Walk it out, move mountains

40:47.904 --> 40:50.263
# And I rise up

40:50.264 --> 40:52.303
# I'll rise like the day

40:52.304 --> 40:54.383
# I'll rise up

40:54.384 --> 40:56.703
# I'll rise unafraid

40:56.704 --> 40:59.103
# I'll rise up

40:59.104 --> 41:04.543
# I'll do it a thousand times again

41:04.544 --> 41:07.023
# And I'll rise up

41:07.024 --> 41:09.263
# High like the waves

41:09.264 --> 41:10.983
# I'll rise up

41:10.984 --> 41:13.583
# In spite of the ache

41:13.584 --> 41:15.823
# I'll rise up

41:15.824 --> 41:24.823
# I'll do it a thousands times again

41:24.824 --> 41:28.383
# I'll rise up

41:28.384 --> 41:33.944
# Yeah, I'll rise up unafraid

41:34.944 --> 41:38.024
# I will rise

41:39.664 --> 41:43.343
# I'll rise up

41:43.344 --> 41:46.143
# I'll rise up

41:46.144 --> 41:50.384
# Oh, I'll rise

41:51.704 --> 41:54.383
# I'll rise up

41:54.384 --> 41:58.544
# Whoa, no matter what you're doing

42:00.624 --> 42:04.943
# I'll be there for you

42:04.944 --> 42:07.064
# Oh oh

42:08.624 --> 42:11.184
# I'll rise up

42:13.224 --> 42:16.143
# Oh oh oh

42:16.144 --> 42:21.663
(VERY HIGH NOTE) # Oh oh

42:21.664 --> 42:23.864
# I'll be right there for you

42:25.464 --> 42:27.064
# Yes, I will

42:28.224 --> 42:30.663
# For you #

42:30.664 --> 42:32.664
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

42:45.984 --> 42:48.784
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

42:54.024 --> 42:55.583
Alesha.

42:55.584 --> 42:57.303
Yes, B-Positive!

42:57.304 --> 43:03.303
Show them! That's how you do it!
You have got fire, light, energy,

43:03.304 --> 43:08.543
joy and passion. You're educating
people and inspiring so many people.

43:08.544 --> 43:11.463
I hope you win, I love you so much.
That was wicked!

43:11.464 --> 43:13.624
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:15.024 --> 43:19.103
I can only echo exactly what
my gorgeous Alesha has just said.

43:19.104 --> 43:21.223
I feel the same thing.

43:21.224 --> 43:26.503
You just make my heart soar. There
is not enough clapping.

43:26.504 --> 43:29.143
I can't do enough!

43:29.144 --> 43:34.023
I love you all so much. I'm so
thrilled that you are our wild card.

43:34.024 --> 43:36.423
I would love to see you
on the Royal Variety Show!

43:36.424 --> 43:38.903
I've said it twice tonight...
(CHEERING)

43:38.904 --> 43:40.904
Oh, my God!

43:42.744 --> 43:46.143
My favourite act of the night
so far.

43:46.144 --> 43:48.584
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:53.024 --> 43:58.383
Not just because of your message,
because you are a world-class choir.

43:58.384 --> 44:00.024
That was incredible!

44:01.744 --> 44:05.303
The details are on screen now
if you think B-Positive Choir

44:05.304 --> 44:07.423
are this year's winners.

44:07.424 --> 44:10.663
Voting doesn't open till the last
act
has performed.

44:10.664 --> 44:12.983
One more time, B-Positive Choir!

44:12.984 --> 44:15.824
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

44:21.104 --> 44:26.383
Our next act is the comedian who
won Monday night's semifinal.

44:26.384 --> 44:30.543
This guy has got everything he needs
to be a success in the final -

44:30.544 --> 44:35.383
likeability, funny material and most
of all he has got 96% battery.

44:35.384 --> 44:37.303
It's Lost Voice Guy!

44:37.304 --> 44:40.983
I'm Lee, also known as the Lost
Voice Guy

44:40.984 --> 44:43.223
and I'm from Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

44:43.224 --> 44:44.544
Why aye, man.

44:46.184 --> 44:50.183
I have cerebral palsy, which means
I can't talk.

44:50.184 --> 44:53.943
But when I'm performing, it's as if
I've finally found my voice,

44:53.944 --> 44:57.224
and it's such a great feeling.
making people laugh.

44:59.304 --> 45:01.863
When I found out I was in the
final...

45:01.864 --> 45:03.663
Lost Voice Guy!

45:03.664 --> 45:05.903
..it was such an awesome feeling.

45:05.904 --> 45:08.823
# Together in electric dreams #

45:08.824 --> 45:13.303
It means the world to me. I was told
to go out and smash it

45:13.304 --> 45:15.143
in my semifinal.

45:15.144 --> 45:17.343
But I think I took it
too literally.

45:17.344 --> 45:21.103
When I got back to the hotel,
I fell over.

45:21.104 --> 45:25.783
It would mean the world to me if
I won Britain's Got Talent.

45:25.784 --> 45:32.023
My ultimate dream is to have a show
in my home city of Newcastle.

45:32.024 --> 45:37.143
I'm so glad I decided to audition,
because it has changed my life.

45:37.144 --> 45:42.983
If I won, the prize money would mean
I could develop a Geordie accent
for myself.

45:42.984 --> 45:45.224
It's all kushti. Bonnie lad.

45:46.304 --> 45:48.304
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

45:56.384 --> 45:58.703
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

45:58.704 --> 46:02.503
I know what you're all thinking -
the fame has gone to his head,

46:02.504 --> 46:06.143
he's had a facelift,
and it's almost as bad as Simon's.

46:06.144 --> 46:08.384
(LAUGHTER)

46:10.504 --> 46:13.503
The truth is that after
winning the semifinal,

46:13.504 --> 46:16.183
I went to the bar to celebrate.

46:16.184 --> 46:19.743
People kept asking
if I wanted another drink.

46:19.744 --> 46:22.903
By the time I'd typed "no",
they'd bought me one.

46:22.904 --> 46:24.664
(LAUGHTER)

46:26.744 --> 46:29.383
In the end, I fell over.

46:29.384 --> 46:32.543
So now I'm known as
the Lost Balance Guy.

46:32.544 --> 46:35.783
(LAUGHTER)

46:35.784 --> 46:38.543
It is also hard to interact
with the audience

46:38.544 --> 46:41.983
when you use a computer,
so please don't heckle me

46:41.984 --> 46:44.024
or we'll be here all night.

46:45.544 --> 46:48.623
I will try to talk to someone,
though.

46:48.624 --> 46:50.663
Hello, David.

46:50.664 --> 46:53.983
Are you having a nice time
in this generic town or city?

46:53.984 --> 46:56.944
Yes, thank you.

47:01.064 --> 47:03.064
(LAUGHTER)

47:08.784 --> 47:10.784
(APPLAUSE)

47:13.784 --> 47:15.383
Good.

47:15.384 --> 47:17.424
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

47:22.304 --> 47:25.863
People often ask me why I want to
put myself in a position

47:25.864 --> 47:28.863
where everyone can stare and laugh
at me.

47:28.864 --> 47:32.863
The truth is that it happens to me
every day anyway.

47:32.864 --> 47:37.303
At least this way there is a
scheduled time and place for it.

47:37.304 --> 47:40.343
And because I want to be famous too.

47:40.344 --> 47:44.264
I started off in a disabled Steps
tribute band.

47:45.304 --> 47:47.344
We were called Ramps.
(LAUGHTER)

47:56.304 --> 47:58.823
That was a bit of an uphill
struggle.

47:58.824 --> 48:02.583
I used to often think about going
on the X Factor

48:02.584 --> 48:06.983
just to see the look on their faces
when they realise I can't
actually sing.

48:06.984 --> 48:11.583
Or dance. Or talk.
(LAUGHTER)

48:11.584 --> 48:16.623
But I would like to play you a clip
of what I think would happen if
I did go on the X Factor.

48:16.624 --> 48:20.664
(TO MUSIC) Don't you know I'm still
standing better than I ever did?

48:21.944 --> 48:24.703
Looking like a true survivor.

48:24.704 --> 48:28.623
Feeling like a little kid.
(CHEERING)

48:28.624 --> 48:33.063
I'm still standing after all
this time.

48:33.064 --> 48:36.464
Picking up the pieces of my life
without you on my mind.

48:38.424 --> 48:40.383
I'm still standing.

48:40.384 --> 48:42.663
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

48:42.664 --> 48:45.063
(CHEERING)

48:45.064 --> 48:47.824
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

48:51.464 --> 48:54.543
Finally you've probably been
wondering what I've been pressing

48:54.544 --> 48:57.703
on my tablet throughout the
competition.

48:57.704 --> 49:01.863
The truth is that I've actually just
spent the last three minutes

49:01.864 --> 49:03.423
voting for myself!

49:03.424 --> 49:09.183
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

49:09.184 --> 49:13.864
I hope you've had fun laughing at
a disabled man. Goodbye.

49:39.824 --> 49:43.623
There is nothing to judge here.

49:43.624 --> 49:46.543
As we have said continually,

49:46.544 --> 49:53.023
you are just such an incredibly
talented, nice, funny guy.

49:53.024 --> 49:54.503
(CHEERING)

49:54.504 --> 49:57.903
I am so, so happy,

49:57.904 --> 50:00.383
honoured that you've come on our
show

50:00.384 --> 50:03.063
and done what you've done over
the past few weeks.

50:03.064 --> 50:06.663
Genuinely...
(CHEERING)

50:06.664 --> 50:09.423
I really, really...

50:09.424 --> 50:12.863
I have a feeling that you will have
a great night tonight.

50:12.864 --> 50:15.983
I've just got a feeling.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

50:15.984 --> 50:22.183
It is just the ultimate example of
turning something that might be
a negative,

50:22.184 --> 50:25.063
losing your voice, into a positive,

50:25.064 --> 50:27.863
the most incredible positive

50:27.864 --> 50:30.703
and it's taken you to the Britain's
Got Talent final.

50:30.704 --> 50:35.663
This whole week, when I have been
asking people who they think will
win,

50:35.664 --> 50:37.703
nine times out of ten
they say YOU!

50:37.704 --> 50:39.824
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

50:41.904 --> 50:46.903
You have such a naughty sense of
humour. You get better and better.

50:46.904 --> 50:51.463
I think you're genius and I think
you will inspire so many people.

50:51.464 --> 50:55.743
For that, you've already won.
Congratulations!

50:55.744 --> 50:57.423
(APPLAUSE)

50:57.424 --> 51:03.983
It gets better and better. This is
no kind of pun, it's not me being
trite,

51:03.984 --> 51:06.823
but I do have no words.

51:06.824 --> 51:11.263
Sometimes no words means so much.

51:11.264 --> 51:15.343
I have no words to say to you
because you are bloody brilliant!

51:15.344 --> 51:16.984
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

51:19.744 --> 51:23.023
A lovely singing voice that you have
got there.

51:23.024 --> 51:25.544
Is there anything you want to say
to the judges?

51:26.544 --> 51:31.583
I would just like to thank the
judges for their support throughout
the competition.

51:31.584 --> 51:34.663
It's meant a lot to me.

51:34.664 --> 51:36.664
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

51:39.264 --> 51:44.143
How has your week been? Apart from
my
little fall,

51:44.144 --> 51:47.703
I've had an amazing week since my
semifinal.

51:47.704 --> 51:50.983
All the positive feedback has been
amazing.

51:50.984 --> 51:53.303
Fantastic.

51:53.304 --> 51:56.343
The give Lost Voice Guy a royal
appointment,

51:56.344 --> 51:58.223
follow the instructions on screen.

51:58.224 --> 52:00.383
But not until we've seen the last
act.

52:00.384 --> 52:02.903
Ladies and gentlemen, Lost Voice
Guy!

52:02.904 --> 52:05.224
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

52:11.584 --> 52:16.503
Time for another break, but
we'll be right back with acrobatics
from the Giang Brothers,

52:16.504 --> 52:21.223
plus Amanda's Golden Buzzer act,
Gruffydd Wynn will be here.

52:21.224 --> 52:25.504
See you in a few minutes.

Welcome back live to the final of
Britain's Got Talent 2018.

52:35.642 --> 52:37.766
I've come up to visit all the acts.

52:37.768 --> 52:42.687
You can smell the relief up here.
I think it's relief, anyway.

52:42.688 --> 52:47.047
Next up tonight are two brothers who
made it to the final 48 hours ago.

52:47.048 --> 52:49.247
One says the other
is a pain in the neck.

52:49.248 --> 52:52.167
Would do you expect when you walk
around with him on your head?

52:52.168 --> 52:53.967
I don't know!

52:53.968 --> 52:58.287
Please don't try this at home.
Don't let yourselves down now.

52:58.288 --> 53:00.168
It's the Giang Brothers!

53:01.928 --> 53:03.407
My name is Quoc Nghiep.

53:03.408 --> 53:04.847
My name is Quoc Co.

53:04.848 --> 53:07.607
BOTH: We are Giang Brothers from
Vietnam.

53:07.608 --> 53:12.527
We are very close brothers. We spend
a lot of time together.

53:12.528 --> 53:15.567
We are best friends.

53:15.568 --> 53:19.688
Performing in the semifinal
was very amazing.

53:23.048 --> 53:26.847
I feel like I could have just seen
the winners of Britain's Got Talent.

53:26.848 --> 53:29.487
My dream has come true.

53:29.488 --> 53:33.367
The act going to the final is...

53:33.368 --> 53:35.727
Giang Brothers!

53:35.728 --> 53:38.847
Getting in the final was amazing.

53:38.848 --> 53:42.247
BOTH: We are in the final of
Britain's Got Talent!

53:42.248 --> 53:45.207
Our final performance tonight

53:45.208 --> 53:50.407
will be the most dangerous
performance of our lives.

53:50.408 --> 53:54.567
You will not imagine what we can do.

53:54.568 --> 53:59.207
We are risking everything tonight.

53:59.208 --> 54:01.968
Our dream is to make a show
around the world.

54:03.328 --> 54:07.927
Winning Britain's Got Talent
will change our lives.

guys
have completed that trick

have all tried this.

We've all said to a friend, "Would
you mind sitting upside down on my
head?"

believe what you are watching.

say it was a special effect.

is incredible.

amazing atmosphere.

edge all week

59:29.328 --> 59:31.247
through acts like this.

59:31.248 --> 59:33.367
It was utterly extraordinary.

I can't believe this is part of
a talent show.

and it's a competition
worth winning.

To go from the semifinal into the
final and have a shot of winning,

59:53.288 --> 59:55.607
you've got to up your game.

you two apart from what you do

it's like the movie
The Greatest Showman.

01:00:08.288 --> 01:00:10.047

the last act has performed.

who was the judges' choice
in semifinal three.

01:00:54.768 --> 01:00:59.287
He's hoping to leave here victorious.
Whatever happens, he's already
the winner.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:03.367
of the Welshman with the most
Welsh-sounding Welsh name, 2018,

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.807
it's Gruffydd Wynn!

01:01:05.808 --> 01:01:09.568
I'm Gruffydd Wyn.
I'm 22 and I'm from Wales.

01:01:12.408 --> 01:01:17.528
Since the audition, I've worked
really hard on improving my vocal.

01:01:19.488 --> 01:01:21.527
The semi-final was incredible.

01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:23.528
I just gave it my all.

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:28.047
You've fought your way for this
place.

01:01:28.048 --> 01:01:30.887
You're like our musical version of
Rocky.

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:34.207
During the results show, I was
anxious.

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:37.367
Through to the final is Gruffydd
Wyn!

01:01:37.368 --> 01:01:39.807
I'm in the final of Britain's Got
Talent!

01:01:39.808 --> 01:01:41.847
Yeah!

01:01:41.848 --> 01:01:46.407
I don't think I could have done this
without the support
of my friends and family.

01:01:46.408 --> 01:01:48.447
I can't thank them enough.

01:01:48.448 --> 01:01:51.607
I'm so proud of you. It was
like the best night of my life.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.647
I'm from a little village in Wales.

01:01:53.648 --> 01:01:56.207
My ultimate dream would be touring
the world,

01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:58.567
doing what I love doing. Singing.

01:01:58.568 --> 01:02:02.367
It feels phenomenal to know that
everybody has got behind me.

01:02:02.368 --> 01:02:05.727
Winning Britain's Got Talent would
change my life for ever.

01:02:05.728 --> 01:02:08.767
Tonight, I'm going to give the
performance of my life.

01:02:08.768 --> 01:02:13.007
I'm really hoping that I can be the
winner of Britain's Got talent this
year.

The Diversity boys are so funny to
have around.

It's like having bigger brothers and
sisters.

To think we have the opportunity to
give that a go as DVJ is so sick.

01:14:21.237 --> 01:14:25.476
I love it, but it's not my ideal job
cos I've always wanted
to be a performer.

01:14:25.477 --> 01:14:27.516
My ambition is to do my own tour.

01:14:27.517 --> 01:14:29.556
That's always been the dream.

01:14:29.557 --> 01:14:31.876
Playing onstage at Hammersmith
Apollo,

01:14:31.877 --> 01:14:34.236
the biggest stage in comedy, wow.

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:36.276
Incredible.

01:14:36.277 --> 01:14:38.316
# Don't know why I hate you

01:14:38.317 --> 01:14:40.317
# I'm not sure what you've done

01:14:42.317 --> 01:14:44.356
# Andy Murray's mum #

01:14:44.357 --> 01:14:46.396
(LAUGHTER)

01:14:46.397 --> 01:14:49.516
Judy Murray sent a tweet saying that
I do her head in too.

01:14:49.517 --> 01:14:51.556
Cheeky devil.

01:14:51.557 --> 01:14:53.956
The winner is Mickey P Kerr!

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:55.996
(CHEERING)

01:14:55.997 --> 01:14:59.836
Being in the final of Britain's Got
Talent is going to change my life.

01:14:59.837 --> 01:15:02.196
Winning it is the stuff dreams are
made of.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:04.236
I'm absolutely skint as well.

01:15:04.237 --> 01:15:07.237
So the money... When does it go
in my account? Please!

01:15:08.757 --> 01:15:10.796
My little girl is three.

01:15:10.797 --> 01:15:13.436
I'm hoping that one day she can look
back on this

01:15:13.437 --> 01:15:15.956
and go 'That's my daddy.
My daddy won that.'

01:15:15.957 --> 01:15:18.877
I've got a bit emotional.
Given myself goosebumps.

01:15:20.277 --> 01:15:22.277
(CHEERING)

01:15:30.357 --> 01:15:32.396
(APPLAUSE)

01:15:32.397 --> 01:15:34.436
That's how you do it!

01:15:34.437 --> 01:15:36.476
Yes!

01:15:36.477 --> 01:15:39.796
That were brilliant. You nailed
that. Thank you very much.

01:15:39.797 --> 01:15:43.276
This is a variety show.

01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:45.316
(CHEERING)

01:15:45.317 --> 01:15:49.396
So I have decided to start with a
poem.

01:15:49.397 --> 01:15:51.436
(CHEERING)

01:15:51.437 --> 01:15:53.437
I've put a lot of effort into it.

01:15:54.797 --> 01:15:56.836
It's quite political.

01:15:56.837 --> 01:15:58.837
I hope you don't mind.

01:16:03.957 --> 01:16:06.596
Bin man, bin man,
where have you been, man?

01:16:06.597 --> 01:16:08.636
(LAUGHTER)

01:16:08.637 --> 01:16:10.676
Thank you very much!

01:16:10.677 --> 01:16:12.677
(CHEERING)

01:16:15.797 --> 01:16:18.356
This next one is not as political.

01:16:18.357 --> 01:16:20.396
But it's no less poignant.

01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:24.836
It's called 'One sheep doesn't know
where it is,

01:16:24.837 --> 01:16:27.237
but the other sheep does know where
it is.'

01:16:31.717 --> 01:16:33.756
Wheee-eere?

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:35.796
Theeee-eere! (LAUGHTER)

01:16:35.797 --> 01:16:37.516
Wheeee-eere?

01:16:37.517 --> 01:16:39.556
Thee-eere!

01:16:39.557 --> 01:16:41.557
Thank you very much.

01:16:46.917 --> 01:16:48.917
I used to be a musician.

01:16:50.717 --> 01:16:52.756
I was terrible.

01:16:52.757 --> 01:16:55.676
So I started doing this.

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:58.476
But I did once get this review.

01:16:58.477 --> 01:17:03.357
It said 'Mickey P Kerr is arrogant,
full stop.'

01:17:04.557 --> 01:17:06.596
And that hurt.

01:17:06.597 --> 01:17:08.636
It did actually.

01:17:08.637 --> 01:17:10.676
AUDIENCE: Aaahh!

01:17:10.677 --> 01:17:13.836
So I started asking people
'Do you think I'm arrogant?'

01:17:13.837 --> 01:17:16.397
They were like 'No.

01:17:17.437 --> 01:17:19.596
You're really sexy and cool.'

01:17:19.597 --> 01:17:21.636
(LAUGHTER)

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.676
'But you're not arrogant.'

01:17:23.677 --> 01:17:26.356
I was like 'Thanks, Mum.'

01:17:26.357 --> 01:17:28.396
(LAUGHTER)

01:17:28.397 --> 01:17:30.436
So I've written a protest song.

01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:35.556
It's like what Bob Dylan
was doing in the 1960s.

01:17:35.557 --> 01:17:37.796
But just more important.

01:17:37.797 --> 01:17:39.836
(LAUGHTER)

01:17:39.837 --> 01:17:42.196
You're an amazing crowd. I've heard
that.

01:17:42.197 --> 01:17:46.036
And some of you might feel that you
want to clap along.

01:17:46.037 --> 01:17:49.876
If you do that, you'll ruin the
song.

01:17:49.877 --> 01:17:51.916
(LAUGHTER)

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.917
I just want that on your conscience.

01:17:55.557 --> 01:17:57.557
This is called I'm Not Arrogant.

01:17:59.477 --> 01:18:02.276
# I'm not arrogant,
I'm just genuinely better

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:04.277
# Than everybody else

01:18:06.157 --> 01:18:08.157
Oh, my God!

01:18:09.757 --> 01:18:11.757
He is so hot!

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:17.436
# It's not my fault
that I'm funny and cool

01:18:17.437 --> 01:18:20.316
# It's not my fault
you were bullied at school

01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:22.676
# I had a little chuckle
when I read your review

01:18:22.677 --> 01:18:24.836
# If you were me,
you'd be arrogant too

01:18:24.837 --> 01:18:27.356
# I run the hundred metres in 8.3

01:18:27.357 --> 01:18:29.876
# I even made the final of BGT

01:18:29.877 --> 01:18:32.436
# Who do you think
set the slaves free?

01:18:32.437 --> 01:18:34.956
# It wasn't Wilberforce,
it was me, Micky P

01:18:34.957 --> 01:18:37.076
# I've got talent
like you wouldn't believe

01:18:37.077 --> 01:18:39.556
# I've written six novels
and I can't even read

01:18:39.557 --> 01:18:41.756
# I learn anything,
I do it with ease

01:18:41.757 --> 01:18:44.676
# I'm a brilliant teacher,
I can teach Chinese, in Leeds

01:18:44.677 --> 01:18:47.836
# I'm not arrogant,
I'm just genuinely better

01:18:47.837 --> 01:18:49.516
# Than anybody else

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:52.476
# I'm not arrogant,
I'm just genuinely better

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:54.876
# Than anybody else... #

01:18:54.877 --> 01:18:56.877
(RHYTHMIC APPLAUSE)

01:18:59.877 --> 01:19:02.036
I'll say summat, you've decided...

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:04.076
Thanks for ruining the song by
clapping.

01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:05.716
Just...
(LAUGHTER AND CHEERING)

01:19:05.717 --> 01:19:09.516
Yeah, just scream away, as well.
I've got t'gig of my life here.

01:19:09.517 --> 01:19:12.036
(CHEERING)

01:19:12.037 --> 01:19:13.409
Let's do the second verse.

01:19:13.411 --> 01:19:15.690
# A man who's tough,
I hit like a truck

01:19:15.691 --> 01:19:17.730
# I taught Bruce Lee,
then I beat him up

01:19:17.731 --> 01:19:20.330
# All the boys look at me,
wanna steal my look

01:19:20.331 --> 01:19:22.250
# All the girls look at me

01:19:22.251 --> 01:19:23.890
# And blush

01:19:23.891 --> 01:19:25.930
# I'm real hard, I'm tough,
fit in the buff

01:19:25.931 --> 01:19:28.450
# On a sesh,
I out-drink Best and Clough

01:19:28.451 --> 01:19:30.890
# I aced every test
and if that's not enough

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:34.050
# I trained ten dogs
and they all won Crufts! Woof-woof!

01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:37.170
# I'm not arrogant,
I'm just genuinely better

01:19:37.171 --> 01:19:39.010
# Than anybody else

01:19:39.011 --> 01:19:42.810
# I'm not arrogant,
I'm just genuinely better... #

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:45.130
Take it off me, choir!

01:19:45.131 --> 01:19:46.770
(LAUGHTER)

01:19:46.771 --> 01:19:48.810
(CHEERING)

01:19:48.811 --> 01:19:51.450
I forgot to mention that, er,
I wanted a choir.

01:19:51.451 --> 01:19:53.090
(LAUGHTER)

01:19:53.091 --> 01:19:55.010
If you could do me a favour, right,

01:19:55.011 --> 01:19:57.570
and just imagine
a hundred-piece choir,

01:19:57.571 --> 01:20:02.010
all dressed in Union Jacks
and they're amazing singers.

01:20:02.011 --> 01:20:05.690
They're going crazy, jazz hands.
This is a massive ending.

01:20:05.691 --> 01:20:09.530
And also imagine that
it's really funny as well.

01:20:09.531 --> 01:20:11.650
That would help me out a lot.
(LAUGHTER)

01:20:11.651 --> 01:20:13.330
I'll try and emulate a little bit.

01:20:13.331 --> 01:20:18.370
# Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

01:20:18.371 --> 01:20:20.410
(INDISTINCT)

01:20:20.411 --> 01:20:22.450
# Now scream! #

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:24.451
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:30.050
(WHISTLING)

01:20:30.051 --> 01:20:32.650
Thank you. Thank you. I mean that.

01:20:32.651 --> 01:20:34.651
(WHISTLING)

01:20:39.051 --> 01:20:41.090
Well done. Well done.

01:20:41.091 --> 01:20:43.530
Simon... Er...

01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:45.890
I think this is
one of these years, you know,

01:20:45.891 --> 01:20:50.050
where it just shows that comedy is
so popular. Micky, you know what?

01:20:50.051 --> 01:20:52.650
You... Like I said to
a couple of acts before,

01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:55.530
you haven't compromised,
you've done your own thing.

01:20:55.531 --> 01:20:57.570
Got to know you at last.

01:20:57.571 --> 01:21:01.130
I think you're a really nice guy
and I think you deserve this break.

01:21:01.131 --> 01:21:04.290
Erm... I just thought I'd play
a song that you could relate to,

01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:06.330
if I'm honest wi' you, Simon.
(LAUGHTER)

01:21:06.331 --> 01:21:09.490
Micky, just when it's going well,
you always ruin it.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:13.010
(LAUGHTER) No, you're funny
and congratulations.

01:21:13.011 --> 01:21:14.690
Thank you.

01:21:14.691 --> 01:21:18.770
I just so loved watching all your
performances on the show.

01:21:18.771 --> 01:21:20.970
I'm a huge fan of yours
and I'm so proud

01:21:20.971 --> 01:21:24.570
there are three fantastic comedians
in the final this year.

01:21:24.571 --> 01:21:27.290
Well done. Thank you, David. Cheers.
(CHEERING)

01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:31.770
The thing I love about you is your
"I can't be bothered" attitude.

01:21:31.771 --> 01:21:34.610
I think that that's brilliant but,
if I'm being honest,

01:21:34.611 --> 01:21:37.890
I didn't find this as funny as
your semi-final performance -

01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:41.770
(BOOING) ..for me... I know I
shouldn't say it cos it's the final

01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:44.970
but I'm being honest. If felt a bit
awkward towards the end,

01:21:44.971 --> 01:21:47.770
but I still love you from
what you've done in the past

01:21:47.771 --> 01:21:50.170
and I hope that
that doesn't go against you.

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:52.090
Well done. I completely agree.

01:21:52.091 --> 01:21:54.810
This is the final. Everything's
hanging on the final.

01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:56.850
It doesn't mean
we don't get to be honest.

01:21:56.851 --> 01:22:00.650
If I'm honest, which I always am,
to my detriment most of the time,

01:22:00.651 --> 01:22:04.210
your semi-final was better than
this audition. Yeah.

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:06.450
I love you to bits.
(BOOING)

01:22:06.451 --> 01:22:09.370
Thank you, judges.
Micky, just for you tonight,

01:22:09.371 --> 01:22:13.250
we've got one surprise judge,
a special judge in the audience.

01:22:13.251 --> 01:22:16.570
OK. Andy Murray's mum, Judy Murray.
What did you think of it? (LAUGHS)

01:22:16.571 --> 01:22:19.290
Hello. Hi, Judy.  Hi.  Hello.

01:22:19.291 --> 01:22:21.730
(CHEERING)

01:22:21.731 --> 01:22:23.731
(CHEERING DROWNS SPEECH)

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:29.490
He does my head in, him.
He does your head in.

01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:31.890
(LAUGHTER) Thank you, Judy.

01:22:31.891 --> 01:22:33.970
If you think
Micky is fit for royalty,

01:22:33.971 --> 01:22:37.450
the details on how to vote
are onscreen now.

01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:39.690
But not until the last act has done
their thing.

01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:42.370
Ladies and gentlemen, Micky P Kerr!

01:22:42.371 --> 01:22:44.410
(CHEERING)

01:22:44.411 --> 01:22:46.450
# THE MONKEES: Daydream Believer

(CHEERING CONTINUES)

01:22:51.371 --> 01:22:53.570
Time for another quick break.

01:22:53.571 --> 01:22:56.330
We'll be right back with the last
act of this year's final:

01:22:56.331 --> 01:22:58.690
Donchez Dacres.
(CHEERING)

01:22:58.691 --> 01:23:02.050
And then it's the chance for you to
start choosing your winner.

01:23:02.051 --> 01:23:03.690
See you in a few minutes.

01:23:03.692 --> 01:23:05.892
(CHEERING)

01:23:10.895 --> 01:23:12.934
(CHEERING)

01:23:12.935 --> 01:23:17.014
Welcome back to the
final of Britain's Got Talent 2018.

01:23:17.016 --> 01:23:21.815
The last performance of the night
is from David's Golden Buzzer act.

01:23:21.816 --> 01:23:24.375
His music's real fine,
he's determined to shine,

01:23:24.376 --> 01:23:27.335
so get ready for
a mash-up of Wiggle And Wine.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:30.495
It's Donchez Dacres! (CHEERING)

01:23:30.496 --> 01:23:33.335
My name is Donchez
and I'm from Wolverhampton

01:23:33.336 --> 01:23:34.975
and I'm 61 years old.

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:36.575
# You can get it
if you really want... #

01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:38.415
I live with my lovely wife Hirfa.

01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:40.455
We've been married for 35 years.

01:23:40.456 --> 01:23:42.495
I work for the AA.

01:23:42.496 --> 01:23:46.535
I've been doing that job
for 29 years. Good grief!

01:47:24.484 --> 01:47:26.483
Sometimes, witches can't be perfect.

01:47:26.484 --> 01:47:28.883
# Waiting for a star to fall

01:47:28.884 --> 01:47:31.763
# And carry your heart into my arms

01:47:31.764 --> 01:47:34.603
# That's where you belong...

01:47:34.604 --> 01:47:37.883
The biggest thing we have to think
about is do we think they can win?

01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:40.124
This says it all.

01:47:41.284 --> 01:47:44.203
# Carry your heart into my arms

01:47:44.204 --> 01:47:46.003
# That's where you belong

01:47:46.004 --> 01:47:47.723
# In my arms, baby, yeah...

01:47:47.724 --> 01:47:49.443
That is the audition tour

01:47:49.444 --> 01:47:51.843
well and truly done.

01:47:51.844 --> 01:47:55.683
Live from the Hammersmith Apollo
for the first live semi-final

01:47:55.684 --> 01:47:57.084
of Britain's Got Talent!

01:47:59.524 --> 01:48:04.083
# Britons never, never never
shall be slaves #

01:48:04.084 --> 01:48:06.124
When you've got it, you've got it.

01:48:07.244 --> 01:48:10.844
David, gay dating is very tricky.
You will find out later.

01:48:12.564 --> 01:48:16.243
I have been disabled
since before it was popular.

01:48:16.244 --> 01:48:17.763
That was fantastic.

01:48:17.764 --> 01:48:19.364
You had it all.

01:48:20.644 --> 01:48:23.044
You are what this show is all about.

01:48:37.724 --> 01:48:40.324
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

01:48:41.564 --> 01:48:44.963
What a year. That's it -
there's nothing more you can do

01:48:44.964 --> 01:48:47.284
because the vote has now closed.

01:48:50.364 --> 01:48:53.243
Don't vote now, it's too late
for your vote to be registered.

01:48:53.244 --> 01:48:56.243
After the break, we'll reveal
the winner of Britain's Got Talent

01:48:56.244 --> 01:48:59.563
and if you want to be a winner
tonight too, have a look at this.

01:48:59.564 --> 01:49:01.363
It's another chance for you at home

01:49:01.364 --> 01:49:05.003
to win a life-changing Â£100,000
from the comfort of your living room.

01:49:05.004 --> 01:49:07.963
It's the biggest cash prize
we've ever given away.

01:49:07.964 --> 01:49:11.723
And the best bit is you don't even
need a talent to win it.

01:49:11.724 --> 01:49:13.883
All this lot did
was pick up the phone.

01:49:13.884 --> 01:49:16.883
You could be just like them -
really lucky and a lot richer.

01:49:16.884 --> 01:49:19.403
I can't believe it. Over the moon.

01:49:19.404 --> 01:49:20.803
Real people do win, yeah.

01:49:20.804 --> 01:49:23.604
For your chance to win Â£100,000...

01:49:47.284 --> 01:49:48.484
Good luck!

Yeah, it's amazing.

01:56:54.941 --> 01:57:00.380
This whole year was about giving up
comedy and starting teaching,

01:57:00.381 --> 01:57:02.620
so this will be a lovely thing
to remember

01:57:02.621 --> 01:57:05.620
as I become a full-time teacher
in September.

01:57:05.621 --> 01:57:07.700
You did so brilliantly.

01:57:07.701 --> 01:57:10.060
