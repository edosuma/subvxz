00:16.715 --> 00:20.993
When I was born,
the world was a far simpler place.

00:22.275 --> 00:25.870
It was all just cops and robbers.

00:37.795 --> 00:40.025
Fucking get down! Get down now!

00:40.235 --> 00:42.305
And you! Stay down! Stay down!

00:42.515 --> 00:44.267
But it wasn't for me.

00:46.435 --> 00:48.585
Then came the Summer of Love.

00:48.795 --> 00:51.867
Hashish and LSD arrived on the scene.

01:00.515 --> 01:05.031
There were villains locked away for
12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand,

01:05.235 --> 01:07.795
doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months

01:07.995 --> 01:11.590
for smuggling two million quid's
worth of puff.

01:11.795 --> 01:15.390
I mean, work it out, mate.
We're in the wrong fucking game.

01:17.075 --> 01:20.784
Drugs changed everything.

01:30.275 --> 01:34.063
Always remember that one day all
this drug monkey-business will be legal.

01:34.275 --> 01:37.347
They won't leave it to people like me
when they figure out

01:37.555 --> 01:43.107
how much money there is to be made -
not millions, fucking billions.

01:43.315 --> 01:47.786
Recreational Drugs plc.
Giving people what they want.

01:47.995 --> 01:50.828
Good times today, stupor tomorrow.

02:02.395 --> 02:03.828
But this is now.

02:04.035 --> 02:07.823
So, until prohibition ends,
make hay while the sun shines.

02:13.475 --> 02:15.830
I'm not against it.

02:16.035 --> 02:19.823
I'm a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine.

02:20.035 --> 02:24.745
Ten years ago, Charlie was for pop stars
or a celebrity's birthday bash.

02:24.955 --> 02:28.834
It was demonized by Daily Mail readers
getting drunk in naff wine bars.

02:30.475 --> 02:33.148
Now they're my biggest clients.

02:34.395 --> 02:38.946
This is Clarkie. Double first at Cambridge
in Industrial Chemistry.

02:39.155 --> 02:41.828
Well, he's got to pay off
his student loan somehow.

02:45.475 --> 02:47.750
Today, I only deal in kilos.

02:47.955 --> 02:49.547
Depending which tariff you use,

02:49.755 --> 02:53.225
that'll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison,

02:53.435 --> 02:55.471
which is more time than a rapist.

02:56.155 --> 02:58.146
C'est la vie.

02:58.355 --> 03:02.746
It is vital that we work
to a few golden rules.

03:02.955 --> 03:04.786
Always work in a small team.

03:04.995 --> 03:09.546
Keep a very low profile. Only deal with
people who come recommended.

03:09.755 --> 03:11.427
It's like selling anything -

03:11.635 --> 03:13.910
washing machines,
hand-made shoes, blow-jobs.

03:14.115 --> 03:17.824
As long as you don't take the piss,
people will always come back for more.

03:18.035 --> 03:22.153
That's not to say we don't weave that
magic that makes two kilos into three,

03:22.355 --> 03:25.028
but never be too greedy.

03:32.395 --> 03:34.147
Know and respect your enemy.

03:34.355 --> 03:38.712
It is only very, very stupid people
who think the law is stupid.

03:43.715 --> 03:45.865
And avoid like the fucking plague

03:46.075 --> 03:48.908
loud, attention-seeking
wannabe gangsters,

03:49.115 --> 03:51.629
in it for the glory, to be a face,
to be a name.

03:51.835 --> 03:56.431
Hello, Slavo. Yeah, this is Duke.

03:56.635 --> 03:59.911
Everything's sweet. When can we meet?

04:00.115 --> 04:04.154
They don't mean to fuck up. They just do.

04:12.555 --> 04:16.992
Forgive me for stating the obvious,
but stay away from the end-user.

04:17.915 --> 04:20.713
They are guaranteed to bring you trouble.

04:20.915 --> 04:23.065
As do guns.

04:23.275 --> 04:25.470
I hate guns. And violence.

04:25.675 --> 04:28.872
But as some Roman general once said,

04:29.075 --> 04:32.112
"If you seek peace, plan for war.”

04:32.315 --> 04:36.103
Morty and his assistant Terry,
they watch my back.

04:36.315 --> 04:40.433
Morty learnt caution the hard way.
He did ten years inside.

04:41.155 --> 04:46.468
He's my bridge to the criminal world, and
he ensures that the traffic is one way.

04:47.035 --> 04:49.754
Look, there's Amsterdam,
and there's Oofdorfe...dorfe.

04:49.955 --> 04:53.391
Not a fucking clue.
None of them speak English.

04:53.595 --> 04:56.234
- Get in the car. I'm sure it's that way.
- Move up.

04:56.435 --> 04:59.233
- I bet you it's that way.
- We've already been that way.

04:59.435 --> 05:03.348
Yeah, but we're gonna go that way again.
Give us the map.

05:04.475 --> 05:06.943
Oh, don't start, the pair of you.

05:07.155 --> 05:09.544
It's like being out with a pair of kids.

05:09.755 --> 05:13.430
- All day you've been moaning.
- It can't be that difficult.

05:13.635 --> 05:16.354
How many fucking greenhouses
can there be?

05:18.995 --> 05:21.065
Morty.

05:21.275 --> 05:22.674
Terence.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.103
Clarkie.

05:24.875 --> 05:29.949
Very, very important.:
pay your supplier prompt.

05:30.155 --> 05:34.273
In our case, that's Mr. Jimmy Price.
He's the top of the pyramid.

05:34.475 --> 05:38.354
Pay him. In full, on time, without fail,
no short counts.

05:38.555 --> 05:42.594
You get no second chances.
Jimmy calls the shots.

05:43.355 --> 05:45.152
Where the fuck is Gene?

05:45.355 --> 05:48.791
- I don't know. Ask me one on sport.
- What time does your watch tell?

05:48.995 --> 05:50.872
- The same as yours.
- He's never late.

05:51.075 --> 05:52.303
Shut the fuck up.

05:55.635 --> 05:57.227
Patience.

05:57.435 --> 05:59.995
Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.

06:00.195 --> 06:02.151
Been with him since way back.

06:02.355 --> 06:04.994
All the drugs and cash go through Gene.

06:05.195 --> 06:07.470
Jimmy trusts him with his life.

06:12.275 --> 06:17.429
By the way, Jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.

06:19.395 --> 06:22.273
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?

06:22.475 --> 06:26.946
Why does everybody assume there's a
problem, just because he wants a word?

06:27.155 --> 06:31.467
Maybe he's grateful.
He fucking should be.

06:31.675 --> 06:33.506
See you at Stoke Park at one.

06:37.475 --> 06:40.114
This is just so beautiful.

06:40.315 --> 06:42.590
We need to get in and out
of here sharpish.

06:42.795 --> 06:45.707
Paul and the tide ain't gonna wait.

06:55.995 --> 06:59.067
Everyone likes to walk
through a door mark ed "Private".

06:59.275 --> 07:02.665
Therefore, have a good reason
to be affluent.

07:02.875 --> 07:05.435
I own a share
in a very successful letting agency.

07:05.635 --> 07:09.674
It gives me an honest income.
Looks good on the self-assessment.

07:12.035 --> 07:16.665
Whereas years ago scallywags
were trying to get money out of banks,

07:16.875 --> 07:20.663
now your problem is
how to get your ill-gotten gains in.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.673
That's a job for Mr. Singh.
He does my laundry.

07:23.875 --> 07:26.264
And in a week,
it will be ready for collection,

07:26.475 --> 07:31.629
in the form of a nice, clean cheque
for a round million.

07:33.115 --> 07:34.946
The business is on the up and up.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.147
But I've always said,
have a plan and stick to it.

07:38.355 --> 07:40.266
Quit while you're ahead.

07:40.475 --> 07:43.308
So barring any fuck-ups,
I'm leaving it all behind.

07:44.595 --> 07:46.506
No, we got the parcel.

07:46.715 --> 07:48.910
Yeah, better than expected, actually.

07:49.115 --> 07:52.630
It's just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end.

07:56.395 --> 07:58.067
Come on, boys, lively, lively.

07:58.275 --> 08:01.392
If we miss this tide, we're
not going anywhere till daylight.

08:01.595 --> 08:05.383
Paul, you ain't being paid to moan.
You're being paid to get my cargo home.

08:06.515 --> 08:10.508
Come on, babe. You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.

08:11.635 --> 08:15.947
Life is so fucking good,
I can taste it in my spit.

08:16.155 --> 08:21.513
I'll treat tomorrow's lunch like a Last
Supper, feign interest in his tales.

08:21.715 --> 08:23.990
And then leave quietly forever.

09:25.395 --> 09:27.386
This is pure class.

09:32.715 --> 09:34.945
Please, follow me, gentlemen.

09:35.155 --> 09:37.350
Mr. Price is in the Oval Room.

09:50.635 --> 09:55.584
- Your guests, Mr. Price.
- Thanks, Angelo. Welcome. Sit down.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.593
How is it with that
Paki accountant I put your way?

09:58.795 --> 10:01.787
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.

10:01.995 --> 10:04.555
Good. Paying your bit
of straight-goer's tax, eh?

10:04.755 --> 10:06.507
We all have to do our bit.

10:06.715 --> 10:09.513
Say hello from me
next time you see him.

10:09.715 --> 10:13.310
You hungry? The grub here
will make your bollocks tingle.

10:13.515 --> 10:15.267
Let's eat.

10:21.515 --> 10:22.789
Right.

10:22.995 --> 10:26.305
We've gotta test the snap-crackle-and-pop
factor on these babies.

10:26.515 --> 10:29.348
Don't ask me.
I ain't fucking touching 'em.

10:29.555 --> 10:31.750
You are a miserable bastard,
you really are.

10:36.675 --> 10:38.267
- Brian.
- What?

10:38.475 --> 10:42.184
Sit down, mate. Got a little treat for you.

10:45.195 --> 10:47.026
Help yourself.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.786
A little privacy, please, Angelo.

11:15.395 --> 11:17.306
What do you want, son?

11:18.435 --> 11:21.745
- Excuse me?
- In life. What are you after?

11:23.195 --> 11:27.711
A shot at the title? A seat by the band?

11:31.155 --> 11:36.548
Well, I don't know, Mr. Price.
That's a very expansive question.

11:36.755 --> 11:39.144
Right, expansive. Good answer.

11:39.355 --> 11:42.552
Years ago, people would've
thought you were a homosexual,

11:42.755 --> 11:44.473
using a word like "expansive" .

11:44.675 --> 11:47.189
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- No.

11:47.395 --> 11:50.273
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.

11:50.475 --> 11:52.591
No, I didn't think you were.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.787
No harm in it, I suppose. Times change.

11:57.555 --> 12:01.594
You know why people like you
can't leave this business?

12:04.835 --> 12:09.033
Because you make too much money
for people like me.

12:09.235 --> 12:12.705
Anyway, I'll get to the point.
I need a favor.

12:12.915 --> 12:16.066
I need someone who's a bit cute,
a smooth operator.

12:16.275 --> 12:19.472
Not a two-a-penny loud-mouth.
Too many grasses around.

12:19.835 --> 12:24.784
- It would be a pleasure, Mr. Price.
- Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy.

12:24.995 --> 12:29.785
Now, this favor. It's not for me, truth
be told. It's for a good friend of mine.

12:29.995 --> 12:34.227
Like a blood-brother.
We were at school together.

12:34.435 --> 12:36.232
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.

12:36.435 --> 12:39.268
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.

12:39.475 --> 12:45.584
I'll give you a clue. Eddie Temple.
Does that name mean anything to you?

12:45.795 --> 12:48.389
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.

12:48.595 --> 12:50.426
Charlie, bless her.

12:50.635 --> 12:54.264
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.033
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.

12:57.235 --> 13:01.387
Or to give her her correct moniker,
Charlie Spencer-Temple.

13:02.075 --> 13:04.031
But she ain't behaving like a lady.

13:04.235 --> 13:07.068
She's hooked on the white powder
and loves a wrong 'un.

13:07.275 --> 13:11.029
This is where you come in, right?
You're gonna find her.

13:12.515 --> 13:15.473
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.

13:15.675 --> 13:17.791
Well, you should get a private detective.

13:17.995 --> 13:23.991
Oh, right. Some nosy ex-policeman,
still on the Scotland Yard payroll?

13:24.195 --> 13:28.188
She's done a runner from a drug
rehabilitation unit in the West Country.

13:28.395 --> 13:29.623
Rehab.

13:29.835 --> 13:35.114
She got loved up in there with some
fucking low-life crackhead called Kinky.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.271
I reckon they've gone back to London.

13:37.475 --> 13:39.227
I wouldn't know where to begin.

13:39.435 --> 13:43.223
Now and then we're asked
to do something beyond the call of duty.

13:43.435 --> 13:49.704
It's called sacrifice, son.
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.

13:51.115 --> 13:54.073
- I'll do my best.
- You do your best and find her.

13:54.275 --> 13:56.709
Keep Mr. McGuire posted.

14:01.555 --> 14:04.467
I've also got a little business
more in your usual line.

14:04.675 --> 14:06.347
Gene'll fill you in.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.546
Everything was to your satisfaction?

14:08.755 --> 14:11.269
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.

14:15.275 --> 14:19.268
" Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.

14:19.475 --> 14:22.592
" Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done."

14:22.795 --> 14:25.992
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?

14:26.195 --> 14:32.225
Close. No, I said it.
James Lionel Price. Good boy.

14:36.195 --> 14:38.504
I'll see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.

14:38.715 --> 14:44.073
Tell you about that bit of business.
I've set up a meet for five with the Duke.

14:51.635 --> 14:54.866
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.

14:55.075 --> 14:57.191
These are super Es. We'll make millions!

14:57.395 --> 15:00.944
I don't care. This is my boat-yard.

15:01.155 --> 15:04.227
I want those pills
and that fucking idiot out of here now.

15:04.435 --> 15:07.233
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul. Calm down, mate.

15:07.435 --> 15:10.745
I've got Gene coming down
with a buyer. You'll be in your whack.

15:10.955 --> 15:13.788
Here, chill. Have a pill.

15:16.355 --> 15:18.823
Gene, why are we doing business
with the Duke?

15:19.035 --> 15:21.503
Yeah, why are we dealing with this joker?

15:21.715 --> 15:25.788
He's a fucking maniac, a relic,
a throw-back, belongs to the Dark Ages.

15:25.995 --> 15:28.065
Will you just shut the fuck up?

15:28.275 --> 15:31.233
We're dealing with him because
he has 1 million Ecstasy pills

15:31.435 --> 15:34.108
of very high levels of MDMA, OK?

15:34.315 --> 15:36.385
One million?

15:36.595 --> 15:39.632
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?

15:39.835 --> 15:41.746
Jimmy wants 50%/ netto.

15:41.955 --> 15:44.628
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger, this lot.

15:44.835 --> 15:47.827
Oh, yeah. Driving a bright yellow
Range Rover. Very subtle.

15:48.035 --> 15:51.072
Calm down. You'll feel better
once you've got your money.

15:51.275 --> 15:54.631
But how much can you spend
in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?

15:57.595 --> 15:59.187
Come on.

16:00.155 --> 16:04.592
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it. Jimmy
doesn't want him fucked about, OK?

16:04.795 --> 16:06.433
Who? Me?

16:06.635 --> 16:10.514
Don't you fucking talk to me
like I'm some kind of mug.

16:10.715 --> 16:15.311
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.

16:15.515 --> 16:17.585
You want to know
how much they're worth.

16:17.795 --> 16:19.706
Yes! Fucking! Please!

16:19.915 --> 16:23.351
Just because you pay a fiver a pop
down the local cattle market,

16:23.555 --> 16:27.230
don't, for fuck's sake,
think these pills are worth millions.

16:27.435 --> 16:28.663
They're not.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.706
We've got to find a buyer.

16:30.915 --> 16:35.272
They've got to split them into parcels.
They've got to find these people.

16:35.475 --> 16:38.228
You'd give a fucking aspirin
a headache, pal.

16:38.435 --> 16:43.111
Then you've got currency fluctuations,
police activity, adverse publicity.

16:43.315 --> 16:47.433
Who has got the readies lying around
to pay for a million Es?

16:47.635 --> 16:50.593
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!

16:54.035 --> 16:56.833
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.

16:57.035 --> 17:02.234
Mate, look, that parcel of pills
has got to be worth five million easy.

17:02.435 --> 17:04.665
- £5 each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.627
It doesn't work like that!

17:06.835 --> 17:11.306
Don't keep fucking saying that to me!

17:11.515 --> 17:15.144
I've got some samples.
I'll stay in touch through Gene, OK?

17:16.275 --> 17:20.426
You wouldn't be so fucking flash
if you didn't have him behind you.

17:20.635 --> 17:24.025
Yeah, well, he fucking has, ain't he?

17:26.795 --> 17:28.751
Where did these monkeys
get a million Es?

17:28.955 --> 17:31.515
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?

17:31.715 --> 17:33.512
We know someone up North who'll buy.

17:33.715 --> 17:37.424
Morty, set up a meeting
with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.

17:40.955 --> 17:43.947
What's really bothering me
is what color to get the Aston.

17:44.155 --> 17:47.227
As you're driving it yourself,
probably green.

17:47.435 --> 17:49.027
- Green?
- Yeah.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.227
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?

17:52.435 --> 17:53.993
Black. Yeah, black.

17:54.195 --> 17:56.584
Black's the color for a hearse or a taxi.

17:56.795 --> 17:59.992
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.

18:00.195 --> 18:03.153
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down. Do join us.

18:03.355 --> 18:07.030
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.

18:07.235 --> 18:09.191
Hugo, follow me.

18:09.395 --> 18:11.784
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.

18:11.995 --> 18:14.190
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.

18:17.395 --> 18:20.910
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?

18:21.115 --> 18:23.504
We're doing the number
on these American birds.

18:23.715 --> 18:26.149
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.233
- The Earl of Oxford.
- Fucking hell.

18:29.435 --> 18:32.268
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.

18:32.475 --> 18:34.909
Can you find somebody
for me really quickly?

18:35.115 --> 18:39.427
- How quickly?
- 20 grand quickly.

18:39.635 --> 18:41.591
You've got our attention.

18:47.115 --> 18:50.744
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?

18:50.955 --> 18:53.185
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?

18:53.395 --> 18:57.354
- It doesn't matter. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

18:58.075 --> 19:01.670
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crackheads.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.831
Chuck 'em a few quid, they'll cough.

19:04.715 --> 19:06.592
- Is there anything else?
- No.

19:06.795 --> 19:08.706
We must get back to work, old boy.

19:11.555 --> 19:13.193
Look...

19:13.395 --> 19:17.832
All right, mate. I'm the Duke's nephew.

19:18.035 --> 19:19.832
Remember me? Sidney.

19:20.035 --> 19:23.710
Sidney. Yes. Hello, mate. How are you?
I'm just off. Have a nice night.

19:23.915 --> 19:25.633
How you doing?
What you doing here?

19:25.835 --> 19:28.793
I hear you're doing business
with my uncle, the Duke.

19:28.995 --> 19:31.509
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

19:35.915 --> 19:38.270
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?

19:38.475 --> 19:42.024
He's a good mate of my uncle's, the Duke.
He was just going.

19:42.235 --> 19:45.910
Yeah, well stick around and have a drink
before you do, yeah?

19:48.115 --> 19:53.064
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.

19:58.515 --> 20:00.506
Charisma, he's fucking got it.

20:00.715 --> 20:03.991
I know he's my uncle and all that,
but you can't deny it.

20:04.195 --> 20:08.825
If you want anything, just tell me,
'cause I got 'em straightened out in here.

20:09.035 --> 20:11.947
If you want any running about,
I'm your man...

20:38.755 --> 20:41.064
- Line?
- What?

20:41.275 --> 20:43.709
I said do you want a line?

20:43.915 --> 20:47.464
No, mate. You knock yourself out.

20:51.715 --> 20:54.912
Lovely, isn't she? Isn't she a darling?

20:55.115 --> 20:56.673
Isn't she?

20:56.875 --> 20:59.514
Siddy, baby, I could do with a livener.

21:04.835 --> 21:09.386
Sidney, it's been great. I'll see you, man.
Thanks for the champagne.

21:09.595 --> 21:11.551
All right.

21:27.835 --> 21:30.588
You let me know when you're happy,
Mr. Lucky.

21:30.795 --> 21:34.185
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.

21:34.395 --> 21:38.991
- Everyone wants a slice as well.
- Same wherever you go. Greedy people.

21:39.195 --> 21:41.834
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.

21:42.035 --> 21:45.425
You lot would know all about that,
wouldn't you?

21:45.635 --> 21:47.751
What the fuck's that, Shanks?

21:47.955 --> 21:52.107
Well, not you lot, but...

21:52.315 --> 21:54.783
...that team down your end.
Like you don't know.

21:54.995 --> 21:57.714
No offence, but what the fuck
are you talking about?

21:59.155 --> 22:02.113
You really do surprise me,
do you know that?

22:02.315 --> 22:04.510
Do you know something we don't?

22:04.715 --> 22:09.835
Don't be giving it
the big fucking innocent, pal.

22:10.035 --> 22:14.586
Because I am not a fucking prick.

22:14.795 --> 22:19.505
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it, Shanks. They really don't know.

22:20.635 --> 22:24.071
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.

22:24.275 --> 22:26.072
Last weekend, right?

22:26.275 --> 22:29.551
The whole place is alight with a rumor

22:29.755 --> 22:32.792
about how this hooligan outfit
from down your end,

22:32.995 --> 22:37.671
run by this joker called the Duke...

22:37.875 --> 22:43.586
- Gazza, go and find them fucking pills.
- All right. Come on. Have a look in here.

22:45.675 --> 22:49.224
They skanked this outfit,
a proper, nutty Serbian militia.

22:49.435 --> 22:53.269
You're the first person ever to be
foolish enough to steal from me.

22:53.475 --> 22:54.794
Shut up.

22:54.995 --> 22:57.031
But you're not the first
to point a gun at me.

22:57.235 --> 22:59.066
Shut up or I'll be the last.

23:02.315 --> 23:03.589
Fuck me.

23:03.795 --> 23:06.434
They got lucky.
He'd just knock ed up a massive batch.

23:06.635 --> 23:11.663
Fucking jackpot. There's fucking
millions of the fuckers in here.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.989
Stay down there. Yes?

23:16.475 --> 23:18.545
You watch them.

23:23.915 --> 23:27.590
- That looks very heavy for you, darling.
- Fuck off.

23:31.315 --> 23:34.034
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?

23:34.235 --> 23:38.467
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I ain't no little girl. Shut up!

23:43.355 --> 23:45.744
- You are shaking.
- Fuck off!

23:45.955 --> 23:47.593
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!

23:47.795 --> 23:49.865
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?

23:50.875 --> 23:53.184
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

24:00.755 --> 24:03.474
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

24:03.675 --> 24:08.191
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.

24:12.075 --> 24:15.954
This will not be the end of this,
Mr. Duke, believe me.

24:16.155 --> 24:19.943
Gazza, go and load them pills.

24:20.155 --> 24:24.194
But he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes.

24:24.395 --> 24:28.388
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.

24:28.595 --> 24:33.350
They're wanted by the United
fucking Nations. Think about that.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.034
Let's get this clear.

24:35.235 --> 24:40.628
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all
to do with us, understand?

24:40.835 --> 24:43.827
Everyone in Amsterdam
believes that he has.

24:44.035 --> 24:46.629
- Bandied your names about.
- What?

24:46.835 --> 24:51.272
Word on the street is they've unleashed
their top boy. His name is...

25:00.635 --> 25:03.627
His party piece, right,

25:03.835 --> 25:07.669
is lopping people's heads off
then fetching them back to his boss.

25:07.875 --> 25:14.348
It's all about honor and respect with
these head-banging nationalist outfits.

25:14.555 --> 25:19.265
They can't have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them.

25:19.475 --> 25:23.309
But we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise.

25:23.515 --> 25:26.313
OK, we accept that.

25:26.515 --> 25:30.986
But with you lot up here punting
this shipment, how does it look?

25:34.155 --> 25:35.429
Bad.

25:36.515 --> 25:40.428
You do know that we're only
talking pennies an article?

25:40.635 --> 25:45.425
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.

25:47.195 --> 25:53.953
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.
Me and him need to have a little think.

25:54.155 --> 25:57.625
Don't think too long. Someone's
gonna make a killing on these pills.

25:57.835 --> 26:02.147
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.

26:06.075 --> 26:09.704
That prick Duke's made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

26:09.915 --> 26:13.749
I told you he was trouble. But he ain't
gonna drag me down with him.

26:13.955 --> 26:17.072
Try Gene again. What a fucking show-up!

26:17.835 --> 26:20.474
- He's not answering, Mort.
- OK.

26:22.355 --> 26:24.425
Try Jimmy at home.

26:24.635 --> 26:26.591
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?

26:28.955 --> 26:33.631
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boat-yard.

26:33.835 --> 26:39.228
- Somebody's about to get a fucking slap.
- Yes, Morty. About fucking time.

27:01.955 --> 27:03.468
Paul?

27:26.315 --> 27:32.584
What a way to go. An iron burning a hole
in your chest until your heart boils.

27:32.795 --> 27:35.753
Paulie would've told him anything, then,
wouldn't he?

27:37.635 --> 27:42.834
You see, that's what happens
when you do business with loons.

27:44.595 --> 27:50.067
Clarkie, have a sniff about. Make some
phone calls, but really quietly.

27:50.275 --> 27:52.948
Find out where the Duke's holed up.

27:53.155 --> 27:55.715
We're gonna need an insurance policy.

27:55.915 --> 28:00.067
What's the fucking idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages, you prick!

28:00.275 --> 28:05.110
- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!

28:05.835 --> 28:11.068
And what's the idea of telling Duke
those pills ain't worth shit?

28:11.275 --> 28:13.231
You don't know
the problems you've caused.

28:13.435 --> 28:17.713
And don't be leaving it to that pair
of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes,

28:17.915 --> 28:19.587
to find that bitch Charlie.

28:19.795 --> 28:22.434
I fucking told you to do it!

28:23.715 --> 28:27.025
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.

28:27.235 --> 28:29.544
The person moving those pills
met a nasty end.

28:29.755 --> 28:30.983
I don't give a fuck!

28:58.955 --> 29:01.992
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.

29:02.195 --> 29:05.312
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?

29:05.515 --> 29:08.393
Tell me what? Have you let him go?

29:08.595 --> 29:12.031
No, I haven't. He's in here.

29:21.475 --> 29:23.830
Kinky.

29:24.035 --> 29:26.754
I still want to be paid.

29:34.395 --> 29:39.515
So, if I'm correct, you three gearheads
are gonna be clucking very soon.

29:39.715 --> 29:43.344
In fact, you're gonna be climbing
the walls any minute, aren't you?

29:43.555 --> 29:46.023
But I'm prepared to do you a favor.

29:46.235 --> 29:48.874
We can do this one of two ways.

29:49.755 --> 29:53.430
We can do it the nice way,
which I think you'll prefer.

29:53.635 --> 29:55.944
Because the other way
is my friend takes you

29:56.155 --> 29:58.225
and puts your head
through the window!

29:59.515 --> 30:03.110
Right, so, was Charlie here with Kinky?

30:03.315 --> 30:07.228
Yeah, she was here for a couple of days.
Kinky turned up with five grand.

30:07.435 --> 30:10.268
- Who's giving Kinky five grand?
- We don't know.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.592
They kept arguing. She was saying,
"Do you think it's that easy

30:13.795 --> 30:17.151
"taking the five grand?"
But she was still caning the rocks.

30:17.355 --> 30:19.027
Where is she now?

30:19.235 --> 30:21.988
Brighton. She kept begging
Kinky to go with her.

30:22.195 --> 30:25.904
The other night, I hears this noise.
I'm looking out there. It's dark.

30:26.115 --> 30:30.631
But I sees this geezer all in black.
It's like something out of a kung-fu film.

30:30.835 --> 30:35.226
- Pay no attention to him. He's a nutter.
- Shut the fuck up.

30:35.435 --> 30:39.189
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?

30:39.395 --> 30:43.354
I don't know. I goofed out myself.

30:43.555 --> 30:46.023
The next morning,
she's gone and Kinky's dead.

30:46.235 --> 30:48.590
You telling me
that somebody's topped Kinky?

30:48.795 --> 30:51.309
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.

30:51.515 --> 30:53.471
I saw it with my own eyes, man.

30:53.675 --> 30:56.587
You smoke too much
of that fucking crack!

30:56.795 --> 30:58.945
Shut the fuck up!

30:59.155 --> 31:01.111
- You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!

31:01.315 --> 31:02.589
Get the fucking money!

31:02.795 --> 31:05.389
Morty! Morty!

31:05.595 --> 31:07.825
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.

31:08.035 --> 31:10.913
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.

31:11.115 --> 31:13.993
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I'll double your money.

31:14.195 --> 31:18.108
- All right. And ten G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.

31:19.275 --> 31:21.311
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

31:25.595 --> 31:28.826
Hello. Ambulance, please.

31:29.035 --> 31:32.311
185 Kirby House, Kings Cross.

31:33.835 --> 31:37.111
There's a dead boy. The door's open.

31:37.315 --> 31:40.387
My name...?

31:40.595 --> 31:42.153
185 Kirby House.

31:53.395 --> 31:54.748
I'm not happy.

32:00.275 --> 32:04.826
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out or I'll sort you out.

32:05.035 --> 32:07.310
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.

32:09.515 --> 32:14.430
Charlie woke up, found him cold,
freaked out, fucked off down to Brighton.

32:14.635 --> 32:16.785
Cody's gonna find her.

32:21.755 --> 32:24.906
Look, I'm gonna freshen these teas up.
They're cold.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.114
Morty?

32:32.235 --> 32:33.793
Is that you?

32:36.075 --> 32:38.145
Where you been hiding, then, eh?

32:39.035 --> 32:42.584
Fucking hell. What you doing
down this neck of the woods?

32:44.195 --> 32:47.153
Hello, Freddie.

33:01.915 --> 33:04.190
So...

33:05.875 --> 33:10.153
...Mr. Mortimer.

33:10.355 --> 33:14.792
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us a few quid,
for old times' sake?

33:15.595 --> 33:17.825
You look well flush, bruv.

33:20.835 --> 33:22.985
Fuck me, he's loaded.

33:26.955 --> 33:30.106
Here, couldn't make it five, could you...

33:30.835 --> 33:32.632
...mate?

33:32.835 --> 33:35.269
- Let's make it ten.
- Yeah.

33:35.475 --> 33:37.431
Ten's...

33:38.795 --> 33:40.194
...a nice...

33:41.675 --> 33:43.267
...round number.

33:44.235 --> 33:45.554
What's the matter?

34:02.515 --> 34:06.269
What's happening? Been away?
Yeah. Ten fucking years.

34:11.675 --> 34:14.030
Going off? Or do you need a red light?

34:18.195 --> 34:20.504
Stop, Morty. Enough. He's had enough.

34:20.715 --> 34:24.833
- I'll tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?

34:31.675 --> 34:34.746
But let's forget about all that.

34:34.955 --> 34:37.185
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr. Hurst.

35:02.075 --> 35:03.793
What the fuck?

35:03.995 --> 35:07.783
I'm sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.

35:17.915 --> 35:19.667
- It's me.
- Hey.

35:19.875 --> 35:22.070
Come on up.
I'll leave the door open.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.427
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.

35:53.795 --> 35:56.468
Have you eaten?
I'll have a Chinky sent up.

35:56.675 --> 35:58.154
No, I'm fine, thank you.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.227
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?

36:01.435 --> 36:05.223
He used to run with me, Morty and Jimmy
in this real kamikaze firm.

36:05.435 --> 36:08.825
In those days, we were headed up
by this guy called Crazy Larry.

36:09.035 --> 36:11.424
Yeah. Got shot, didn't he? Bit of a lunatic.

36:11.635 --> 36:14.513
That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.

36:14.715 --> 36:16.671
Always doing loads of drugs.

36:18.755 --> 36:21.508
- Not worried about keeping a low profile.
- I love you.

36:21.715 --> 36:23.865
Turn over anyone
who couldn't go to the law.

36:24.075 --> 36:26.384
No fucking problem. Boys will be boys.

36:26.595 --> 36:30.349
Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry...

36:31.475 --> 36:33.147
...shoots himself stone dead.

36:33.875 --> 36:35.866
This is a bit of a dilemma.

36:36.075 --> 36:39.704
This desperate posse can't call the law
or an ambulance.

36:39.915 --> 36:42.713
Morty, out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty,

36:42.915 --> 36:45.110
actually volunteered
to dispose of the body.

36:45.315 --> 36:48.307
No head. But things went a bit wrong.

36:49.195 --> 36:53.825
The guy Larry told to help him
was Freddie Hurst.

36:54.035 --> 36:57.471
The total imbecile
had fallen asleep at some traffic lights

36:57.675 --> 37:00.269
in a drunk en, drug-induced stupor.

37:00.475 --> 37:05.310
Morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.

37:05.515 --> 37:08.154
Being black
was even worse than being Irish.

37:08.355 --> 37:10.266
They threw the book at Morty.

37:10.475 --> 37:12.784
Freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting.

37:12.995 --> 37:16.112
Morty did ten years because
Freddie Hurst fell asleep?

37:16.315 --> 37:18.431
But he kept his mouth shut.

37:18.635 --> 37:22.628
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.

37:22.835 --> 37:27.306
All because some kid was being ridden
against his will by a psychotic lunatic.

37:27.515 --> 37:31.747
- Who?
- But you, you fuck!

37:31.955 --> 37:33.274
Larry.

37:33.475 --> 37:37.229
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.

37:37.435 --> 37:40.745
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.

37:40.955 --> 37:43.150
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?

37:43.355 --> 37:45.266
Probably.

37:45.475 --> 37:50.265
Larry made enemies very easy. Took
liberties with too many straight lads.

37:52.235 --> 37:54.032
Not for me.

37:56.515 --> 37:59.825
Listen, son. Let me explain
something to you.

38:00.035 --> 38:03.311
Freddie's in intensive care
with a bit of a brain hemorrhage.

38:04.275 --> 38:08.314
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.

38:08.515 --> 38:11.712
Now, if Freddie dies,
you're either in the dock with Morty

38:11.915 --> 38:16.670
or you're in the witness box
putting him away. Think about that.

38:21.595 --> 38:23.950
You know, I will have one of those.

38:30.635 --> 38:33.468
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?

38:33.675 --> 38:35.984
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

38:36.195 --> 38:40.427
- I don't know. I thought he was here.
- Well, go and fucking find him.

38:40.635 --> 38:45.231
He's probably having a night out
while us mugs baby-sit these.

38:47.395 --> 38:51.547
Gene, what the fuck
am I gonna do about these Serbs?

38:55.195 --> 38:58.028
Come here. I have something for you.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.793
- You're gonna need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.

39:09.915 --> 39:14.431
I fucking hope not. Are you trying
to scare the shit out of me?

39:14.635 --> 39:17.274
I mean, I fucking hate guns.

39:17.475 --> 39:20.547
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?

39:20.755 --> 39:23.315
Hey, point it upwards.

39:25.155 --> 39:27.430
Oh, for fuck's sake.

39:29.595 --> 39:32.029
Here, let me see if it's loaded.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.304
You look like
you could do that blindfolded.

39:51.515 --> 39:54.666
I can and I do.

39:54.875 --> 40:00.313
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.

40:01.235 --> 40:06.070
Meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task

40:06.275 --> 40:09.745
so the rest of the mind can find peace.

40:13.595 --> 40:16.189
And you find peace with guns.

40:16.915 --> 40:20.351
Well, on occasion. It has been known.

40:22.675 --> 40:26.270
Listen. I know it's not your thing.

40:28.195 --> 40:33.349
But if you ever have to kill somebody,
never, ever tell a living soul.

40:51.795 --> 40:55.026
- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.

40:58.115 --> 41:00.185
How did you get this number?

41:00.395 --> 41:04.513
Boatman Paul gave me your number,
in the end.

41:04.715 --> 41:08.185
I believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer,

41:08.395 --> 41:11.990
and you're the person I should talk to
about the return of this cargo,

41:12.195 --> 41:14.709
stolen by your associate, the Duke.

41:14.915 --> 41:18.749
Dragan, the Duke
is nothing to do with me.

41:18.955 --> 41:23.790
Mr. Duke came to Amsterdam,
used your name, said he work ed for you.

41:26.715 --> 41:30.185
- Are you listening?
- Dragan...

41:33.715 --> 41:38.152
I've got an idea. Why don't
you come round for breakfast?

41:38.355 --> 41:41.904
I'll squeeze some orange juice
and we'll talk about this like adults.

41:42.115 --> 41:45.266
- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.

41:45.475 --> 41:47.193
- Do you know where I live?
- No.

41:47.395 --> 41:48.953
Well, fuck off, then.

41:59.755 --> 42:02.667
Duke's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.

42:02.875 --> 42:05.992
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy. No sweat.

42:06.195 --> 42:09.471
Calm down, Gazza.
I'm sure Duke's just fine.

42:09.675 --> 42:13.429
Well, you've got 48 hours to find a buyer
or I'm sending 'em back, OK?

42:13.635 --> 42:16.547
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.

42:16.755 --> 42:20.430
It ain't worth the grief. We've gone
underground, off the radar.

42:20.635 --> 42:22.944
Nothing personal,
but I don't trust you.

42:36.715 --> 42:39.787
Listen, I just had a phone call
from Gazza.

42:39.995 --> 42:44.591
Being a cry-baby. Threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours.

42:44.795 --> 42:48.834
Between you and that gobshite Duke,
he's promised Jimmy a bumper pay-day.

42:49.035 --> 42:51.503
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...

42:51.715 --> 42:53.546
He put yous together.

42:53.755 --> 42:56.588
You and Duke. That's his job.

42:56.795 --> 43:02.267
If you two can't make music, he's gonna
want his whack out either way.

43:09.595 --> 43:11.347
That's business.

43:17.635 --> 43:21.389
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off.

43:21.595 --> 43:24.234
What? Please tell me
you're fucking joking.

43:24.435 --> 43:27.347
Well, I am beginning to regret it now.

43:28.795 --> 43:31.832
We've got to find the Duke,
find these fucking pills.

43:32.035 --> 43:34.549
We can't rely
on these monkeys to call Gene.

43:34.755 --> 43:37.223
We've looked everywhere.
There's no sign.

43:37.435 --> 43:39.505
You can't find any of his firm?

43:39.715 --> 43:44.550
Maybe this Dragan geezer's already found
the Duke and done the business.

43:44.755 --> 43:47.827
Yeah, well, there is someone I can call.
Keep looking.

43:48.035 --> 43:50.913
Wait. You're gonna leave it to us?

43:51.115 --> 43:54.551
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.

43:54.755 --> 43:59.510
And if we don't find the Duke,
this, everything, all over.

44:06.795 --> 44:09.753
- It's me. Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.

44:09.955 --> 44:13.231
- What took you so long to call?
- I've been busy.

44:13.435 --> 44:16.154
- You sound sleepy. You just woken up?
- Not long ago.

44:16.355 --> 44:20.951
- So when am I gonna see you?
- What are you doing now?

44:21.155 --> 44:25.751
Nothing. No, I was just lying in bed,
wondering what to do.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.105
- You still in bed?
- Yeah.

44:35.795 --> 44:41.233
- You lying there naked?
- I've got a little T-shirt on. But that's all.

44:41.435 --> 44:43.505
Here, wait, listen to this.

44:46.475 --> 44:48.227
What's that?

44:48.435 --> 44:51.074
I was just rubbing the phone
against my fanny.

44:51.715 --> 44:55.424
Did you like it?
My, oh my, it's fresh this morning.

44:55.635 --> 45:01.870
Look at my nipples, standing up like
little soldiers. What is a girl to do?

45:02.075 --> 45:07.149
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?
I'll book a table for lunch.

45:07.355 --> 45:08.583
St Martin's Hotel.

45:08.795 --> 45:11.593
Don't worry about a table.
We'll have room service.

45:11.795 --> 45:13.626
- Yeah, OK.
- One hour.

45:48.475 --> 45:50.511
Hang on.

46:24.035 --> 46:26.310
Oh, shit.

46:29.035 --> 46:32.027
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.

46:37.315 --> 46:41.706
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.

46:41.915 --> 46:43.394
Not round here, I hope.

46:43.595 --> 46:47.747
No, over by Greenwich market.
So you can relax. It's just the two of us.

46:56.675 --> 47:00.384
Patience. All good things
come to those who wait.

47:03.315 --> 47:04.668
Stay put.

47:24.275 --> 47:28.473
Hello, it's me. It's me. Shut up and listen.

47:28.675 --> 47:32.714
Sidney, Duke's nephew is working down
by Greenwich Market. Go and look.

47:34.475 --> 47:37.626
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.

47:38.915 --> 47:40.143
OK.

47:47.035 --> 47:49.071
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...

48:15.315 --> 48:19.752
One moment, Mr. Troop. I want to hear
what this bastard has to say for himself.

48:32.715 --> 48:35.388
I'm Jimmy's old colleague, Eddie Temple.

48:36.835 --> 48:39.269
- Fuck!
- He told you to locate my daughter.

48:39.475 --> 48:41.750
Hunt her down like some lost mongrel.

48:43.715 --> 48:46.229
He said you asked for his help.

48:46.435 --> 48:52.510
Mr. Troop could find anyone
on the planet in ten minutes flat.

48:52.715 --> 48:58.312
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter,
you'd be over the edge like that.

48:58.515 --> 49:00.233
You'd join that shit, Kinky,

49:00.435 --> 49:03.552
who thought he could take my five grand
and fuck me over.

49:03.755 --> 49:09.227
The audacity. How fucking dare you?

49:09.435 --> 49:12.871
I've known Jimmy Price for 45 years.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.669
It pays me to keep an eye on him.

49:17.875 --> 49:20.184
Do you know what a remora fish is?

49:21.915 --> 49:24.304
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?

49:25.555 --> 49:29.707
Well, Jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life.

49:29.915 --> 49:33.908
I thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job.

49:34.115 --> 49:37.266
But I've checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.

49:37.475 --> 49:40.626
But you keep very, very bad company.

49:43.275 --> 49:46.950
You know, I host
a charity golf tournament every year.

49:47.155 --> 49:50.306
Quite an event in the social calendar,
if I do say so myself.

49:50.515 --> 49:55.748
I like to invite Jimmy. Some of my friends
find him absurdly hilarious.

49:55.955 --> 49:58.628
Drinks are on me. Drinks for everyone.

49:58.835 --> 50:01.588
Champagne.
Fucking good gear and all.

50:01.795 --> 50:07.392
But I've come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums.

50:07.595 --> 50:10.632
Jimmy, as usual
on the look out for tidbits,

50:10.835 --> 50:14.908
has met the development minister
of some tin-pot republic.

50:15.115 --> 50:17.470
They're trawling the West
for investments.

50:17.675 --> 50:22.590
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.

50:22.795 --> 50:26.504
They've sent in men from Timbuktu
explaining all the details.

50:26.715 --> 50:31.505
Profits, shares, long-term investments,
short-term investments.

50:31.715 --> 50:37.745
They've even made him an honorary
citizen. Even made him one of the tribe.

50:37.955 --> 50:41.914
What we didn't know,
until it all ended in tears,

50:42.115 --> 50:44.345
was that the hard-line
communist insurgents

50:44.555 --> 50:48.230
who control the country
outside the mining areas...

50:48.435 --> 50:51.029
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.

50:51.235 --> 50:53.032
The communists have broken through.

50:53.235 --> 50:55.385
Heading for the capital
with little resistance.

50:55.595 --> 50:57.426
What the fuck are you on about?

50:57.635 --> 50:59.671
I got word they were planning a push.

50:59.875 --> 51:01.945
The final coup de grâce. I told Jimmy.

51:02.155 --> 51:03.907
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!

51:04.115 --> 51:07.630
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.

51:07.835 --> 51:11.430
As if it was some little kiddie's
piggy bank.

51:11.635 --> 51:15.753
Now, I explained that wasn't possible.
We thought we'd bought a government.

51:15.955 --> 51:18.515
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.

51:18.715 --> 51:20.228
You win some, you lose some.

51:20.995 --> 51:22.553
How much are we talking?

51:22.755 --> 51:24.473
It's only a cheeky half-mill, Jim.

51:24.675 --> 51:28.190
- It's much more than that.
- How much?

51:28.395 --> 51:31.228
- 13.
- 13 what?

51:31.435 --> 51:37.510
- 13 million pounds. I'm fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?

51:37.715 --> 51:45.269
13 million pounds!
How could you be so fucking stupid?

51:45.475 --> 51:48.114
You've been right grafted,
royally turned over.

51:48.315 --> 51:51.830
- Like some Yank buying London Bridge.
- Don't talk to me like that.

51:52.035 --> 51:53.866
He accused me of instigating it.

51:54.075 --> 51:56.430
It's no coincidence
I met them at your tournament.

51:56.635 --> 51:58.466
Are you fucking demented?

51:58.675 --> 52:00.825
Asked me to fly to Zurich
to see the minister,

52:01.035 --> 52:04.744
still parked up
in La Maison Grande, still eating well.

52:04.955 --> 52:09.710
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.

52:09.915 --> 52:13.510
Jimmy thought he'd keep Charlotte
hostage while you went to get his money.

52:13.715 --> 52:18.584
Little Jimmy was so stupid,
he thought he couldn't lose either way.

52:18.795 --> 52:20.023
I'm sorry, what?

52:20.235 --> 52:23.147
If you find Charlotte,
he's got his hostage.

52:23.355 --> 52:25.550
If I find you trying to find her,

52:25.755 --> 52:27.473
I do his dirty work.

52:28.875 --> 52:32.584
- I'm still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.

52:33.675 --> 52:37.554
I've found out something
very interesting about Jimmy,

52:37.755 --> 52:39.427
something I've long suspected.

52:41.875 --> 52:45.948
But I'll let Jimmy explain.

52:46.155 --> 52:48.623
You follow me.

53:35.435 --> 53:37.073
You've no doubt suffered Jimmy's

53:37.275 --> 53:40.187
" CID was geezers you
was at school with" routine?

53:40.395 --> 53:42.272
The other chap's Albert Carter.

53:42.475 --> 53:44.943
Another twisted bastard
from the old neighborhood.

53:45.155 --> 53:49.546
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax and enjoy.

53:49.755 --> 53:52.269
It ain't like your lot in the old days.

53:52.475 --> 53:55.148
- They've all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.

53:55.355 --> 53:59.064
I have to box clever with those
college boys from Anti-Corruption.

53:59.275 --> 54:04.429
- Fucking dogs. Slags. Ten grand?
- It's the going rate, Jim.

54:05.315 --> 54:07.954
Ten K. Hardly seems worth the bother.

54:08.155 --> 54:13.354
Well, there's only so much
in those informer funds.

54:16.355 --> 54:19.552
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

54:19.755 --> 54:24.306
What? About me working
for the old firm? Listen. Gene...

54:24.515 --> 54:26.631
...is too loyal for his own good.

54:28.715 --> 54:31.593
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.

54:31.795 --> 54:34.946
- 'Cause it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?

54:35.595 --> 54:37.233
Mr. Troop made it for me.

54:38.395 --> 54:42.627
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.

54:42.835 --> 54:46.384
Don't you want to hear
what Jimmy has to say about you?

54:46.595 --> 54:51.430
I've got one for you.
Pluck ed and ready for the pot.

54:52.035 --> 54:55.186
- Just give us a name and he's gone.
- In time.

54:55.395 --> 54:57.989
I don't want a bunce.
I want him out of the way.

54:58.195 --> 55:01.870
Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, ain't he?

55:02.075 --> 55:06.114
Reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement.

55:06.315 --> 55:08.875
I want him away for 12.

55:09.075 --> 55:12.272
If he's got a kilo of class A,
he's looking at double figures.

55:12.475 --> 55:15.194
- I'll put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.

55:15.395 --> 55:18.114
He's got a few quid .
He'll come in handy.

55:18.315 --> 55:22.354
I set him up with that slippery accountant
in the first place.

55:22.555 --> 55:24.864
Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?

55:25.075 --> 55:29.273
"You will miss him when he's gone,
Mr. Price. "

55:29.475 --> 55:34.071
Is that you, the flash runt
who thinks he's retiring?

55:34.275 --> 55:37.426
You'd no idea what Jimmy was up to?

55:37.635 --> 55:40.024
How do you think these fuckers
earn a living?

55:40.235 --> 55:44.387
I would've thought a smart young man
like you would know that already.

55:44.595 --> 55:47.905
- Can I have that?
- Mr. Troop.

55:50.595 --> 55:52.506
Thank you.

55:54.755 --> 55:58.543
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.

55:58.755 --> 56:02.145
I'll keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home. Wash and brush up.

56:02.355 --> 56:05.427
Opera tonight. The Damnation of Faust.

56:05.635 --> 56:10.231
Man sells his soul to the devil. All ends
in tears. These arrangements usually do.

56:20.235 --> 56:22.669
One more thing, young man.

56:22.875 --> 56:26.550
Always remember, the art of good
business is being a good middleman.

56:26.755 --> 56:28.711
Bye-bye.

56:57.035 --> 56:58.627
Fuck!

01:02:10.715 --> 01:02:13.548
- I've got him.
- Got who?

01:02:14.115 --> 01:02:16.709
Sidney, remember? Yellow Range Rover?

01:02:16.915 --> 01:02:19.668
Seems they sent our friend out
for something to eat.

01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:22.594
Good. Tell Morty.

01:03:24.075 --> 01:03:26.430
- So what do we do now?
- Call Morty.

01:03:40.035 --> 01:03:43.266
Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.

01:03:43.475 --> 01:03:46.592
If I do not get my cargo back,
you're a dead man.

01:03:46.795 --> 01:03:51.744
Dragan, I've been doing some checking.

01:03:51.955 --> 01:03:54.025
- I've found out who you represent.
- Good.

01:03:54.235 --> 01:03:56.829
I can point you towards
your boss's merchandise.

01:03:57.035 --> 01:03:58.627
- Come to my hotel...
- Look...

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:03.590
- I'd rather meet you in a public place.
- You have nothing to fear.

01:04:03.795 --> 01:04:08.664
- I'm a reasonable man.
- That's not what I've heard.

01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:11.105
I'll meet you at...

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:16.911
I'll meet you
at Greenwich Park Observatory.

01:04:17.115 --> 01:04:19.834
- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.

01:04:20.035 --> 01:04:23.584
- Tomorrow. Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.

01:04:24.435 --> 01:04:26.710
I'll be there.

01:04:31.075 --> 01:04:33.509
That's rude, Mr. Dragan.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.792
It's Conditions Red down there.

01:04:46.995 --> 01:04:50.829
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lock-up.

01:04:51.035 --> 01:04:53.993
Have a look at the geezer at the front,
on the door.

01:04:56.955 --> 01:04:59.753
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.

01:04:59.955 --> 01:05:01.752
What about the blokes in red?

01:05:01.955 --> 01:05:04.264
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.

01:05:04.475 --> 01:05:07.228
The lorries come in one color,
go out another.

01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:09.585
But they're nothing to do with the Duke.

01:05:09.795 --> 01:05:12.229
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?

01:05:13.475 --> 01:05:16.785
It doesn't matter. I've got work to do.

01:05:16.995 --> 01:05:20.112
- Stay here. Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.

01:05:20.315 --> 01:05:23.387
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean " night"?

01:05:23.595 --> 01:05:27.190
- I've been here all day. Get Clarkie.
- Day and fucking night. Got it?

01:05:48.115 --> 01:05:52.313
Hello, young man. Thank you
for coming at such short notice.

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:56.303
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?

01:05:56.515 --> 01:06:00.474
I'm in the best of health, Mr. Temple.
Thank you for asking.

01:06:01.315 --> 01:06:03.545
- How are you keeping?
- I'm very well.

01:06:03.755 --> 01:06:07.031
- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex.

01:06:07.235 --> 01:06:10.147
No wonder it took him 60 years to write it.

01:06:10.355 --> 01:06:12.266
How's the family?

01:06:12.475 --> 01:06:14.352
What is this? A vicar's tea party?

01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:17.433
You do sometimes take
your conversations away with you.

01:06:17.635 --> 01:06:19.830
Being a clever bastard, are we?

01:06:20.035 --> 01:06:23.789
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I'm not.

01:06:23.995 --> 01:06:27.544
Then we'll have to trust each other,
won't we? Sit down.

01:06:33.835 --> 01:06:36.508
I've been thinking, after
our chat the other day.

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:40.025
Your pills. How much for the lot?

01:06:42.115 --> 01:06:44.151
No, I've already got a buyer.

01:06:44.355 --> 01:06:47.506
Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.

01:06:47.715 --> 01:06:49.990
I told you, lah. I'm still thinking.

01:06:50.195 --> 01:06:53.346
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?

01:06:53.555 --> 01:06:56.194
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.

01:06:56.395 --> 01:06:58.511
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.

01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:01.467
They've got history.

01:07:01.675 --> 01:07:03.950
Bad juju.

01:07:04.155 --> 01:07:08.148
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's
in hot pursuit.

01:07:08.355 --> 01:07:13.110
If I sold them to you, I'd have to
disappoint him. And he is definitely not...

01:07:13.315 --> 01:07:18.343
I did you a big fucking favor
letting you know about Jimmy.

01:07:18.555 --> 01:07:20.864
I think you owe me.

01:07:22.595 --> 01:07:25.871
2½ million in sterling and euros,
high-denomination used notes.

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:30.387
So if I gave you three million,
that would keep everyone happy.

01:07:30.595 --> 01:07:32.392
Let me state my position.

01:07:33.475 --> 01:07:35.830
You can sell these pills
to whoever you like.

01:07:36.035 --> 01:07:39.266
That's your privilege.
That's your business.

01:07:39.475 --> 01:07:41.591
But I'll tell you,

01:07:41.795 --> 01:07:46.869
I'll be very, very unhappy
if you don't sell 'em to me.

01:07:47.075 --> 01:07:49.145
You understand?

01:07:53.755 --> 01:07:56.747
OK, Mr. Temple. Three million. Done.

01:07:58.035 --> 01:08:01.914
- My buyer's not gonna be happy, though.
- Fuck him. He'll get over it.

01:08:10.675 --> 01:08:13.109
I'm gonna need some help.

01:08:14.155 --> 01:08:18.033
Someone who can eliminate the problem.
Someone who's a bit handy.

01:08:18.234 --> 01:08:20.988
Whoa! Slow down, kidder.

01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:25.670
Mr. Lucky does a drop of freelance work.

01:08:26.555 --> 01:08:29.911
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.

01:08:30.755 --> 01:08:34.145
You tell him when,
and he'll come down on the train.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:38.231
Thanks, Trev.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.433
Excuse me.

01:08:44.835 --> 01:08:46.063
Mr. Temple.

01:08:47.035 --> 01:08:50.788
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment?

01:08:50.995 --> 01:08:53.429
Monday. No, Tuesday, probably.

01:08:53.635 --> 01:08:56.069
Tuesday? I'm paying
over the odds, remember?

01:08:56.274 --> 01:08:59.585
England! Typical. Even drug dealers
don't work weekends.

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:15.582
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.

01:09:15.795 --> 01:09:19.707
Yeah, everything's under control.

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:26.710
- Cody's been chasing his ten grand.
- Yeah. I'll call him later.

01:09:32.115 --> 01:09:34.582
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.

01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:36.274
Oh, yeah? What's that?

01:09:36.995 --> 01:09:39.350
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!

01:09:39.555 --> 01:09:42.991
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!

01:09:44.955 --> 01:09:47.787
- Murder? Who's dead?
- Jimmy.

01:09:47.995 --> 01:09:50.872
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.

01:09:51.075 --> 01:09:54.511
- Open this fucking door!
- Why?

01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:57.105
Open this fucking door!

01:10:01.395 --> 01:10:05.274
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen. Just listen.

01:10:05.475 --> 01:10:10.708
Listen to me, Morty.
I got a call from a cozzer we've got bent.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:13.224
They found Jimmy's body last night.

01:10:13.435 --> 01:10:16.507
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.

01:10:16.715 --> 01:10:18.945
He's no killer.
Somebody's made a mistake.

01:10:19.155 --> 01:10:21.828
All right, look. Here. We'll see.

01:10:22.035 --> 01:10:23.627
Read it. Read it out loud.

01:10:23.835 --> 01:10:27.748
"To senior ranks only. Murder Squad
investigation. James Lionel Price."

01:10:27.955 --> 01:10:30.264
Read the fucking ballistics report.

01:10:30.475 --> 01:10:34.309
" Preliminary ballistics report. No arms
recovered. Disintegrated on impact.

01:10:34.515 --> 01:10:36.187
"One recovered cartridge casing."

01:10:36.395 --> 01:10:40.434
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:42.591
" ...consistent with weapon used

01:10:42.795 --> 01:10:48.153
" in unsolved homicide of Lawrence
Gower a.k.a. Crazy Larry Flynn."

01:10:48.355 --> 01:10:52.985
Wait. I got it. Whoever killed
Crazy Larry must've killed Jimmy.

01:10:53.195 --> 01:10:57.188
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.

01:10:57.395 --> 01:10:59.750
The one he stole from my flat.

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:04.506
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?

01:11:04.715 --> 01:11:08.025
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:11:13.595 --> 01:11:16.553
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.

01:11:16.755 --> 01:11:21.545
- He was a police informer!
- Jimmy a grass? Are you fucking mad?

01:11:21.755 --> 01:11:25.350
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I've got a recording at home.

01:11:25.555 --> 01:11:28.831
Of Jimmy and a cozzer
called Albie Carter.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:34.109
Gene, let's listen to this shit.

01:11:34.315 --> 01:11:37.990
If he's lying, we'll both fucking kill him.

01:11:38.195 --> 01:11:40.311
Mr. Mortimer reckons

01:11:40.515 --> 01:11:45.908
the Tylers are bringing in shooters
from Jamaica via Manchester.

01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:49.266
They got someone in Immigration
straightened out.

01:11:49.475 --> 01:11:53.548
I don't think anybody gives a fuck
about spades shooting spades.

01:11:53.755 --> 01:11:58.226
Don't you care
about dead darkies, Albert?

01:11:58.435 --> 01:12:02.348
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

01:12:02.555 --> 01:12:05.308
What? About me working for the old firm?

01:12:07.675 --> 01:12:09.666
Convinced?

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.946
You don't fuck about, do you?

01:12:22.035 --> 01:12:24.868
Jimmy was skint, huh?

01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:28.351
That's why he set up the whole
Amsterdam business with Duke.

01:12:32.355 --> 01:12:36.553
I really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves, right?

01:12:36.755 --> 01:12:38.711
Really?

01:12:41.155 --> 01:12:43.271
Why did you kill Larry?

01:12:46.235 --> 01:12:48.795
Funnily enough,
it was Jimmy who persuaded me.

01:12:49.915 --> 01:12:51.746
Jimmy never liked Larry.

01:12:51.955 --> 01:12:55.186
Look at that wrong 'un waving
his money around. It ain't right.

01:12:56.275 --> 01:12:58.550
Hey, I love you, man.

01:12:58.755 --> 01:13:04.227
He saw the future was drugs
and it needed to be run like a business.

01:13:04.435 --> 01:13:06.585
Crazy Larry
was no fucking businessman.

01:13:06.795 --> 01:13:09.263
After that business with Kilburn Jerry...

01:13:09.475 --> 01:13:13.309
That's it, son. You do him. Bollocks!

01:13:14.635 --> 01:13:15.954
...he wanted him gone.

01:13:18.955 --> 01:13:21.833
I didn't have any problem doing him.

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.151
That's why I did it.

01:13:28.355 --> 01:13:30.664
But why did you keep the gun?

01:13:30.875 --> 01:13:34.424
Sounds silly now, but it was my favorite.

01:13:35.555 --> 01:13:38.786
I hope you don't tell the other guns
you've got favorites.

01:13:44.515 --> 01:13:46.949
So what's the next move, boss?

01:13:50.915 --> 01:13:53.190
Well, I'm going to bed.

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:57.070
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.

01:14:29.195 --> 01:14:30.992
Sorry?

01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:37.551
Sorry, mate, what was that?

01:14:37.755 --> 01:14:40.792
Would you pack that in?
I've got a fucking test next week.

01:14:40.995 --> 01:14:43.668
OK. OK, I'm sorry. I was just saying...

01:14:58.315 --> 01:15:00.909
So when does the target get here, then?

01:15:01.115 --> 01:15:04.152
The target? The target's gonna be here
at exactly midday.

01:15:04.355 --> 01:15:05.583
Where?

01:15:05.795 --> 01:15:07.911
- Here, right fucking here.
- Got a photo?

01:15:08.115 --> 01:15:10.151
- Don't worry about it.
- Who's worried?

01:15:10.355 --> 01:15:13.347
I'll have some binoculars.
I'll give you a little signal.

01:15:13.555 --> 01:15:16.752
I could get the 13.10 home from here.

01:15:16.955 --> 01:15:18.513
Let's have a little recce.

01:15:20.035 --> 01:15:22.868
After we do the business,
walk slowly back.

01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:25.669
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.

01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:27.911
Don't run, whatever you do.

01:15:28.115 --> 01:15:31.312
The first five minutes,
nobody'll have a clue what's going on.

01:15:31.515 --> 01:15:34.427
Hopefully, it'll be mayhem.

01:15:38.555 --> 01:15:40.989
So try to stay relaxed.

01:15:41.915 --> 01:15:45.066
Don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

01:15:45.275 --> 01:15:47.266
Or me.

01:15:47.475 --> 01:15:53.027
Afterwards, take me to the Underground
station. I'll look after myself.

01:15:56.795 --> 01:15:58.023
There.

01:16:00.275 --> 01:16:02.266
Time?

01:16:04.035 --> 01:16:06.390
Six minutes to twelve.

01:16:09.635 --> 01:16:11.387
I hope he's not gonna be late.

01:16:14.835 --> 01:16:18.066
- Maybe he'll be early.
- That'll be nice.

01:16:29.355 --> 01:16:31.664
Can you see that guy on the left?

01:16:36.795 --> 01:16:41.710
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.

01:16:44.395 --> 01:16:48.070
- Are you sure?
- For fuck's sake. I'm gonna call him.

01:16:48.955 --> 01:16:51.594
It's up to you. You're the client.

01:16:58.195 --> 01:17:02.074
- As soon as he answers, he's gone, OK?
- Okey-dokey.

01:17:06.235 --> 01:17:07.714
Stand by.

01:17:11.475 --> 01:17:13.352
Now.

01:17:14.675 --> 01:17:18.350
Hello, may I help you?

01:17:20.155 --> 01:17:24.945
Don't move a muscle.

01:17:25.155 --> 01:17:29.273
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.

01:17:29.475 --> 01:17:34.674
You English, you have no idea
of honor and respect.

01:17:34.875 --> 01:17:40.825
I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duke.

01:17:41.035 --> 01:17:43.788
I haven't got your pills.
Just give me a day.

01:17:46.155 --> 01:17:49.511
Don't piss in my pock et
and tell me it's raining.

01:17:49.715 --> 01:17:51.387
Now listen for the last time.

01:17:51.595 --> 01:17:55.952
- You'll bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't... Jesus!

01:17:56.155 --> 01:17:59.989
You have one more day.

01:18:01.235 --> 01:18:06.992
See you tomorrow at dusk by the statue.
Remember, I will be watching you.

01:18:15.515 --> 01:18:17.392
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:18:19.555 --> 01:18:22.752
Getting Trevor's man down here
to shoot this Serb in a park!

01:18:23.795 --> 01:18:27.424
Trevor's gonna go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?

01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:29.865
- What a fucking mess.
- You've gone mad.

01:18:30.075 --> 01:18:31.827
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off!

01:18:32.035 --> 01:18:34.230
You want to play?
You do it somewhere else.

01:18:34.435 --> 01:18:37.711
If you do it near me,
I'll put you in a fucking wheelchair.

01:18:38.755 --> 01:18:40.586
Stick to your fucking sums.

01:18:41.435 --> 01:18:43.824
Listen. Listen to me.

01:18:44.035 --> 01:18:46.185
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.

01:18:46.395 --> 01:18:49.705
He's just put a bullet
between Lucky's eyes. I was there!

01:18:49.915 --> 01:18:52.509
He's watching our every move.
Who's next, me?

01:18:52.715 --> 01:18:56.754
- I wish.
- Fuck off! It could've been you or Morty.

01:18:59.595 --> 01:19:03.383
Dragan said he wanted the pills
and the Duke. Where's the Duke?

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.584
What?

01:19:12.235 --> 01:19:14.829
I should've told you this earlier.

01:19:15.555 --> 01:19:18.513
Duke and Slasher
came by the office the other day.

01:19:18.715 --> 01:19:23.664
Paul the boatman was topped last night.
I've got to get on my toes sharpish.

01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:26.389
I want Jimmy
brought here right now, yeah?

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:30.907
Getting that smug fucking yuppie bastard
to tell Duke those pills were useless,

01:19:31.115 --> 01:19:33.265
after sending us over in the first place.

01:19:33.475 --> 01:19:35.306
Hang on, you've lost me now.

01:19:35.515 --> 01:19:39.952
If you have us over, I swear by fucking
almighty God, I'll call the fucking law.

01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:42.715
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call the law.

01:19:42.915 --> 01:19:44.826
She didn't mean that. She's upset.

01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:47.708
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:05.435 --> 01:20:08.188
That's where playing
at being a gangster gets you.

01:20:08.395 --> 01:20:11.034
You're not in there 'cause I like you.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.705
I'm beginning to feel left out.

01:20:15.915 --> 01:20:17.348
Why?

01:20:17.555 --> 01:20:20.069
Freddie Hurst is still in intensive care

01:20:20.275 --> 01:20:23.585
after your jolly little reunion
the other day.

01:20:23.795 --> 01:20:26.025
Fucking hell, Duke.

01:20:26.235 --> 01:20:28.624
For once, you might be of some use.

01:20:45.115 --> 01:20:48.425
That was Gazza on the phone. It's on.

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:52.389
He'll pick you up at nine in the morning.
Gallows Corner. You know it?

01:20:52.595 --> 01:20:53.869
Yeah.

01:20:54.075 --> 01:20:59.547
With Jimmy gone, these pills will make
a nice contribution to my retirement fund,

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:02.349
so don't fuck things up again, OK?

01:21:02.555 --> 01:21:08.630
If you do, you'll wish this Dragan had
shot you between the eyes, understand?

01:21:09.955 --> 01:21:11.911
Best of luck.

01:21:13.955 --> 01:21:15.274
Thanks.

01:21:36.915 --> 01:21:38.189
Fuck off!

01:21:38.395 --> 01:21:41.785
Sidney, I've told you,
stop answering my phone, OK?

01:21:41.995 --> 01:21:43.633
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:22.348
- All right?
- Hello, Sidney.

01:22:22.555 --> 01:22:25.786
- How you doing, then?
- I'm all right. How are you?

01:22:25.995 --> 01:22:27.553
I'm all right, mate, yeah.

01:22:55.835 --> 01:23:00.545
Gazza, this place stinks. We want to
get you out of here. 50 pence a pill.

01:23:00.755 --> 01:23:02.905
That way, we all come out
with something.

01:23:03.115 --> 01:23:08.235
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.

01:23:08.435 --> 01:23:12.189
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead. Duke and
Slasher, fuck knows where they are.

01:23:12.395 --> 01:23:15.307
This gear is knock-off,
and the Serbs you nicked it from,

01:23:15.515 --> 01:23:17.710
they'd kill you like you'd take a piss.

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:22.504
Gazza, the Old Bill are outside!

01:23:23.555 --> 01:23:25.785
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go!

01:23:26.515 --> 01:23:28.745
- Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.

01:23:28.955 --> 01:23:31.025
- Put it down!
- We're going in!

01:23:31.235 --> 01:23:34.830
Gazza, look at me. Put it down.
You're gonna get us all shot.

01:23:36.195 --> 01:23:37.913
Fuck it! Boat!

01:23:57.995 --> 01:23:59.951
Stay there!

01:24:11.075 --> 01:24:12.713
Fuck!

01:24:18.115 --> 01:24:19.753
Come on!

01:24:28.115 --> 01:24:31.346
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!

01:24:31.555 --> 01:24:33.113
Get in.

01:25:21.195 --> 01:25:22.674
Is this for me?

01:25:26.315 --> 01:25:28.112
Yes.

01:25:35.875 --> 01:25:38.628
Your cargo's gone, I'm afraid.

01:25:38.835 --> 01:25:41.747
- It was seized by...
- I know already.

01:25:41.955 --> 01:25:45.106
- How do you know?
- I watched.

01:25:45.315 --> 01:25:48.466
I don't believe this.
Captain's gonna go fucking spare!

01:25:48.675 --> 01:25:51.872
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.

01:25:52.075 --> 01:25:54.828
Oh, fucking hell.

01:25:55.035 --> 01:25:57.674
Leave it to me, lads.
I'll explain to Inspector Cox

01:25:57.875 --> 01:26:01.026
that his suspect has scarpered
'cause of your blundering.

01:26:01.235 --> 01:26:03.191
Knobheads. Helmets off.

01:26:11.635 --> 01:26:14.149
Does this settle things, then?

01:26:33.875 --> 01:26:36.309
Tango Foxtrot, over.

01:26:36.515 --> 01:26:38.983
Delta Uniform...

01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:48.507
How did that other errand go?

01:26:48.715 --> 01:26:51.593
Success, as far as I could make out.

01:26:54.995 --> 01:26:57.304
Where is my fucking prisoner?

01:26:57.515 --> 01:27:00.393
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...

01:27:00.595 --> 01:27:03.063
Shut up, you soppy wanker.

01:27:03.275 --> 01:27:05.664
- Indigo...
- Dingo Bongo.

01:27:06.795 --> 01:27:09.514
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:09.715 --> 01:27:11.114
You can fuck off, then.

01:27:12.115 --> 01:27:15.346
So where are the pills, genius?

01:27:15.555 --> 01:27:17.944
I think this is them now.

01:27:20.955 --> 01:27:23.344
What the fuck?

01:27:26.155 --> 01:27:28.385
- Couldn't leave this behind.
- Greenies.

01:27:31.835 --> 01:27:34.668
You are in the wrong game.
You should work with us.

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:38.834
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.

01:27:39.035 --> 01:27:42.072
It seems so. Your pills
are in the back. Help yourself.

01:28:17.515 --> 01:28:18.743
Hello.

01:28:20.195 --> 01:28:24.268
OK. Yes, I will do. Bye-bye.

01:28:27.995 --> 01:28:31.624
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.

01:28:34.955 --> 01:28:36.752
Good news.

01:28:37.795 --> 01:28:40.184
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.

01:28:40.395 --> 01:28:42.625
Listen, I've got one for you.

01:28:42.835 --> 01:28:45.224
Irishman caught his son snorting Charlie.

01:28:45.435 --> 01:28:49.667
He said, " If I catch you doing that again,
I'll rub your fucking nose in it."

01:29:14.155 --> 01:29:17.033
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.

01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:20.991
Boss wants to see you in his office.

01:29:29.515 --> 01:29:31.904
Come in. Sit down.

01:29:37.115 --> 01:29:39.390
Here you are. Payment.

01:29:51.035 --> 01:29:54.744
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?

01:29:54.955 --> 01:30:00.985
You and Jimmy have caused my little
angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:04.312
She's off to Arizona
for a course of intense treatment.

01:30:04.515 --> 01:30:08.303
I'm keeping those pills for myself,
by way of compensation.

01:30:08.515 --> 01:30:12.906
I think I'm entitled. Simple. End of.

01:30:13.115 --> 01:30:16.744
The amount of trouble
you've caused the last few days.

01:30:16.955 --> 01:30:18.673
Jimmy.

01:30:18.875 --> 01:30:20.945
Poor little Jimmy.

01:30:21.675 --> 01:30:23.427
It would be in your interests

01:30:23.635 --> 01:30:26.707
if this thing finishes here, now, today.
Understand?

01:30:27.795 --> 01:30:31.583
It doesn't matter what I do.
This lot are gonna come after you.

01:30:32.675 --> 01:30:35.906
They're too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country,

01:30:36.115 --> 01:30:39.152
looking for revenge. Look at 'em.

01:30:39.355 --> 01:30:42.984
Bunch of under-endowed,
ageing fuck pigs.

01:30:43.195 --> 01:30:44.867
Are you enjoying this?

01:30:45.075 --> 01:30:47.987
No. On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.

01:30:48.195 --> 01:30:50.072
You're a bright young man.

01:30:50.275 --> 01:30:53.073
This monkey business is in your blood,
under your skin.

01:30:53.275 --> 01:30:57.109
You're not getting out, you're just
getting in. I've every faith in you.

01:30:57.315 --> 01:31:03.914
One day, it will be you sitting here telling
some young Turk the facts of life.

01:31:05.875 --> 01:31:07.831
And they are, Mr. Temple?

01:31:14.555 --> 01:31:17.149
You're born, you take shit.

01:31:17.355 --> 01:31:20.665
Get out in the world, you take more shit.

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:24.993
Climb a little higher, you take less shit.

01:31:25.195 --> 01:31:27.868
Until one day, you're up
in the rarefied atmosphere,

01:31:28.075 --> 01:31:30.384
and you've forgotten what shit
even looks like.

01:31:33.115 --> 01:31:35.390
Welcome to the layer cake, son.

01:31:51.555 --> 01:31:54.547
This thing ends here, tonight.
You understand?

01:31:55.195 --> 01:31:57.834
Drug money's easy money, not grief.

01:31:58.395 --> 01:32:01.592
The odds, as you can see,
are against you.

01:32:01.795 --> 01:32:03.023
Goodnight.

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:39.224
If you're gonna hang around in this game,
that's where you've got to be.

01:32:39.435 --> 01:32:43.394
In your bonded warehouse with
the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work,

01:32:43.595 --> 01:32:45.665
while you deliver the suspect lecture

01:32:45.875 --> 01:32:49.106
to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks.

01:32:50.155 --> 01:32:54.273
The art of good business
is being a good middleman.

01:32:54.475 --> 01:32:58.673
Putting people together. I'll always
thank Eddie for telling me that.

01:33:00.115 --> 01:33:02.948
It's all about honor and respect.

01:33:03.755 --> 01:33:07.031
This is the end, Mr. Duke, as I told you.

01:33:49.515 --> 01:33:55.067
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.

01:33:55.275 --> 01:33:59.063
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.

01:34:00.515 --> 01:34:03.666
All right? Where do you want
the money sent, lah?

01:34:03.875 --> 01:34:07.345
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.

01:34:07.555 --> 01:34:12.629
Don't worry about it, kidder.
Man was a prick, anyway. Later.

01:34:13.275 --> 01:34:14.754
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

01:34:15.595 --> 01:34:19.304
Did I really think Eddie was gonna
give me three million for those pills?

01:34:19.515 --> 01:34:21.551
Did I fuck.

01:34:21.755 --> 01:34:25.714
But suddenly there was a void
where once there was Jimmy Price.

01:34:25.915 --> 01:34:30.306
And after a couple of days, Eddie's little
getting-in-and-getting-out speech

01:34:30.515 --> 01:34:33.473
started to make sense.

01:35:00.075 --> 01:35:02.111
- Angelo. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

01:35:02.315 --> 01:35:04.909
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.

01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:13.712
The king is dead.

01:35:14.595 --> 01:35:16.267
Long live the king.

01:35:21.075 --> 01:35:22.747
Well, I'm honored.

01:35:24.835 --> 01:35:28.066
But for me this is all over. I'm getting out.

01:35:28.275 --> 01:35:30.425
What was true then is true now.

01:35:31.315 --> 01:35:34.466
Have a plan. Stick to it.

01:35:34.675 --> 01:35:37.109
So I'm sure you must have
lots to discuss,

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.670
but I have no business being here.

01:35:41.595 --> 01:35:43.825
I've got someone to meet.

01:35:45.995 --> 01:35:47.314
Adios, amigos.

01:35:56.795 --> 01:35:58.467
Paul the boatman.

01:35:58.675 --> 01:36:00.108
Kinky.

01:36:00.315 --> 01:36:01.543
The Duke.

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.427
Slasher.

01:36:03.635 --> 01:36:05.193
Kilburn Jerry.

01:36:05.395 --> 01:36:06.953
Crazy Larry.

01:36:07.155 --> 01:36:08.827
Mr. Lucky.

01:36:09.035 --> 01:36:10.673
Troop.

01:36:12.035 --> 01:36:13.514
Jimmy.

01:36:15.235 --> 01:36:17.510
I don't want to add my name to that list.

01:36:20.315 --> 01:36:23.068
My name? If you knew that,
you'd be as clever as me.

01:36:23.275 --> 01:36:25.391
No!

01:36:29.475 --> 01:36:31.431
I'm sorry.
