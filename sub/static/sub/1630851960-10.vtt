to put me on the "Do Not Call" list!?

I'd call you when it's time to come.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.728
-Work hard, play harder, love.
-[laughing] Yeah, okay.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.645
Yes, Ana,

21:53.729 --> 21:55.689
so I just swooped up
this adorable place,

21:56.481 --> 22:01.069
and it is in major, major need
of your orgasmic work all over the walls.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.989
-Please say yes, please say yes.
-Of course! I'd be happy to!

22:04.072 --> 22:05.657
-[screams of celebration]
-[laughter]

22:05.907 --> 22:06.742
Okay, perfect.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.994
Now, it's not gonna be ready
for a couple months.

22:09.077 --> 22:09.953
It's this taco spot

22:10.412 --> 22:11.747
on South Reyes.

22:11.830 --> 22:12.706
Oh!

22:13.123 --> 22:15.417
-Rob sold it to me. Do you remember him?
-Oh, Rob...

22:15.542 --> 22:16.835
He's the cutie with the booty,

22:16.918 --> 22:18.754
-who you swore you would--
-Oh, yeah.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.921
Mama Fina's?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.798
Yes! Yes. You know it!

22:21.882 --> 22:25.302
Yes. It's the perfect, perfect place
for my theme pop-up food experience.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.721
It's very Saved By The Max
but with Fuller House.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.390
-[Tim] Oh, yeah.
-I just need the lease to be up soon,

22:30.474 --> 22:31.975
and then I can make the transformation.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.810
[hushed] One minute, lovelies.
I'm sorry, BRB.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.021
Okay. So, what do you say, hon?
Are you in?

22:40.609 --> 22:42.819
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. What's the matter?

22:43.403 --> 22:44.321
You look like--

22:44.404 --> 22:47.074
Like I'm about to do something
really fucking crazy?

22:47.991 --> 22:51.495
Uh... Yeah, that sounds about... right.

22:55.957 --> 22:58.210
[phone ringing]

23:00.670 --> 23:01.838
-Hello?
-[Erik] Pop?

23:01.922 --> 23:04.216
I need you to go back to the house
and pick up the car seat.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.968
[in Spanish] What the hell?
I’m on my way to the hospital!

23:07.260 --> 23:09.638
Sorry. Lidia's freaking out
because I forgot it.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.348
[in Spanish] Goddamn it. Okay, you got it.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.641
-Thank you.
-[phone clicks shut]

23:12.766 --> 23:13.934

23:14.518 --> 23:17.312
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.398
Thank you so much for being here.

23:19.481 --> 23:24.194
It is so lovely to have so many colors
of the rainbow under one roof, right?

23:24.277 --> 23:25.987
[sharp exhale] Okay. Now...

23:26.363 --> 23:30.367
let's make some noise

23:59.229 --> 24:01.982
[stammers] Is this wall for sale.
Where do I bid?

24:02.065 --> 24:03.567
[in Spanish] Is she quitting her job?

24:03.650 --> 24:07.237
[in Spanish] Ana, come back here!
I'm gonna give you a whooping! Ana!

24:07.612 --> 24:09.614
[hip-hop music continues]

24:12.033 --> 24:14.244

What did you do?

24:44.357 --> 24:45.400
Is this your vehicle?

24:45.901 --> 24:48.862
-Yes.
-Are you Casimiro Morales?

24:49.112 --> 24:50.071
Yeah.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.575
We have a warrant for your arrest
for an outstanding fine

24:53.658 --> 24:56.411
on a vandalism charge
from six months ago.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.791
I don't know, but I can pay it.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.212
[woman speaks indistinctly over intercom]

25:07.672 --> 25:09.674
Are you gonna say something, Chaka Jr.?

25:11.259 --> 25:13.845
I'm kinda worried
you're gonna spray paint the baby.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.726
Yessika was right.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.650
I have to tell you something.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.319
-About the shop.
-[Erik] Hey! Hey...

25:29.402 --> 25:31.863
Tía Beatriz and Nayeli
are about to come out, so y'all can go in.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.823
But you gotta hurry,
we're about to go into surgery.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.617
-Are you freaking out?
-Are you okay?

25:35.700 --> 25:37.994
Of course I'm freaking out!
I'm about to be a baby daddy!

25:38.078 --> 25:39.579
-Okay.
-And, and...

25:39.663 --> 25:41.414
they're about to cut open
the love of my life.

25:41.498 --> 25:44.125
And I'm supposed to stand there
and be like, "Oh, don't worry, chula.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.836
The nice doctor's just gonna
slice you open like a fucking turkey

25:46.920 --> 25:49.589
and pull out a human is all."
I mean, should I be calm?

25:49.673 --> 25:51.258
All right, maybe slice is not the right--

25:51.341 --> 25:53.635
I don't think she's gonna like
being called a turkey, but...

25:53.927 --> 25:55.095
[Chris exhales deeply]

25:56.304 --> 25:58.807
-[speaking over intercom continues]
-[Ana] Okay.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.310
What if I fuck her up?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.187
Ah... Lidia's used to you fucking up.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.606
Not her, the baby.
What if I fuck up the baby?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.984
I have no clue what it's like
to be a good father.

26:09.067 --> 26:09.901
Hey.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.862
-You are not your dad.
-I'm not?

26:13.196 --> 26:16.199
I'm a stoner that lives in a garage.
What the hell do I have to offer anyone?

26:16.283 --> 26:17.284
Hey, stop it.

26:17.450 --> 26:18.285
Look at me.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.247
You're pretty damn smart.
And you're loyal.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.916
And the way you show up for everyone,

26:25.417 --> 26:27.627
it's everything she needs, primo.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.380
So just change your deodorant,

26:30.463 --> 26:32.841
-handle your BO, and you'll be fine.
-[laughing]

26:34.634 --> 26:35.760
Glad you're here, man.

26:37.012 --> 26:37.887
Me too.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.348
[indistinct voice over intercom]

26:42.017 --> 26:44.436
[phone ringing and buzzing]

26:47.397 --> 26:48.773
Excuse me. [sighs]

26:51.568 --> 26:52.611
[Erik sighs]

26:53.111 --> 26:55.196
[Ernesto, on phone]
Were you being attacked by a gang?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.657
Don't believe everything you see
on Primer Impacto, all right?

26:57.741 --> 26:59.075
-They were protesters.
-Christian,

26:59.159 --> 27:00.827
you're wasting all of my sacrifices

27:00.910 --> 27:03.246
just so you can end up
like my brother or like Erik.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.249
Is that what you want?
You want to end up a nobody?

27:06.833 --> 27:10.128
-God, you're such a jerk. I like it here.
-[Ernesto scoffs]

27:11.129 --> 27:14.007
And that's as close as I'm gonna get
to the dream right now.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.718
[sighs] Not if I pay for cooking school,
mijo.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.345
I'll send you the money.

27:18.428 --> 27:19.846
[in Spanish] I'll send it right now.
