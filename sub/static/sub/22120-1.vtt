01:57.935 --> 01:58.736
That,

01:59.804 --> 02:02.771
that is what I like to see.

02:02.773 --> 02:03.574
Passion!

02:05.076 --> 02:05.876
You guys,

02:07.478 --> 02:12.348
you guys fought for every
square inch of the ice tonight.

02:12.350 --> 02:16.152
You let them know they
were in our house!

02:20.691 --> 02:23.126
How about Justin here
taking the lead as always.

02:26.631 --> 02:30.399
And Matty, Matty absolutely
bleeding for it in the corners.

02:34.172 --> 02:36.539
And how about these two
young guns over here,

02:36.541 --> 02:38.907
Tyson and Schultzy banking
in those hard minutes

02:38.909 --> 02:40.209
at the end of the second.

02:40.211 --> 02:41.544
Let's give it over.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.853
I think we all know who this
hardware goes to tonight.

02:49.954 --> 02:51.487
Let's give it over.

02:56.761 --> 02:57.562
Way to go.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.331
King for our knights!

03:08.373 --> 03:11.440
That's how the
fucking warriors do it!

03:11.442 --> 03:12.277
Yeah!

03:14.279 --> 03:18.814
Harper, you know what Yeezy
says, watch the throne baby.

03:18.816 --> 03:21.450
I'm coming for that crown bud.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.752
You get hit in the head too
many times tonight Schultzy?

03:23.754 --> 03:25.020
Or are you still spinning
from when that guy

03:25.022 --> 03:26.522
turned you inside out out there.

03:26.524 --> 03:27.756
You don't know
what you're talking about bro.

03:27.758 --> 03:29.325
That there is
an education bud.

03:29.327 --> 03:31.060
Playing with the big boys now.

03:31.062 --> 03:33.862
Yeah big boys,
that's for sure eh?

03:33.864 --> 03:36.232
Your fucking fat ass can
hardly get up and down the ice.

03:36.234 --> 03:37.466
You little bitch.

03:37.468 --> 03:41.106
Easy boys, give it a
rest, Dylan have a seat.

03:45.710 --> 03:46.909
Alright as you all know

03:46.911 --> 03:48.511
I take a lot of pride
in wearing the C.

03:48.513 --> 03:50.879
It means a lot more to me than
just a letter on my jersey,

03:50.881 --> 03:52.281
just like coach always
says, everyone has a role,

03:52.283 --> 03:55.784
and every role has
it's responsibility.

03:55.786 --> 03:59.957
So I want you rookies to
get up there for a minute.

04:06.397 --> 04:08.431
Look we've all been
rookies before,

04:08.433 --> 04:09.832
we all know what it's like.

04:09.834 --> 04:13.836
New town, new teammates,
we've all been there.

04:13.838 --> 04:17.140
You boys have shown
us a lot so far.

04:17.142 --> 04:19.310
We're proud of you, and so

04:21.612 --> 04:22.880
as is tradition

04:24.549 --> 04:26.482
a proper Warriors welcome
means we gotta scalp em!

04:40.231 --> 04:41.065
Come on!

04:48.873 --> 04:50.208
Mother fucker!

05:48.766 --> 05:51.369
Ahh!

06:09.220 --> 06:10.788
Won't stop now boy!

06:20.298 --> 06:23.165
Oh crying for your mother huh?

06:23.167 --> 06:24.633
Hey Wendy.

06:24.635 --> 06:25.834
Looks like
this little devil

06:25.836 --> 06:27.270
has been keeping you occupied.

06:27.272 --> 06:29.137
He's good, tons of fun huh?

06:29.139 --> 06:32.408
Thank you for
keeping an eye on him.

06:32.410 --> 06:34.877
Let me give you
a hand with that.

06:34.879 --> 06:38.048
Thank you, that's
very sweet of you.

06:56.934 --> 06:59.268
- Is Cody home?
- Huh?

06:59.270 --> 07:01.136
Is Cody here?

07:01.138 --> 07:05.310
Uh no, I think he went over
to Tracy's after practice.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.013
Left you all alone huh?

07:10.247 --> 07:11.081
I guess.

07:19.223 --> 07:20.456
Hey Bill.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.690
Hey, hey.

07:21.692 --> 07:22.491
Can I give you
a hand with that?

07:22.493 --> 07:24.360
Sure, thank you.

07:24.362 --> 07:25.861
Just get it down to
the crawl space there.

07:25.863 --> 07:26.697
Hey.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.602
Hold on, hold on, okay.

08:47.878 --> 08:49.745
The theme of the
game this week is focus.

08:49.747 --> 08:52.748
If I'm gonna play on the
fourth line I need to be

08:52.750 --> 08:56.854
so concentrated, so in
tune with what's going on.

08:59.524 --> 09:00.357
Party.

10:47.932 --> 10:52.069
Is your head still tingling
from that fucking yeti hit?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.608
No man, I'm fine.

11:08.886 --> 11:10.252
You know that ringing sound

11:10.254 --> 11:12.921
when everything
is totally quiet?

11:12.923 --> 11:14.525
What do you mean?

11:17.227 --> 11:19.161
When like if you're
all alone somewhere,

11:19.163 --> 11:23.267
and everything's completely
silent, like nothing.

11:31.475 --> 11:33.341
Not like this cause
the heater's going

11:33.343 --> 11:36.681
but if it's actually
quiet like nothing.

11:40.551 --> 11:44.722
Yeah no I think I know
what you mean it's just that,

11:47.324 --> 11:49.191
it's like your ears
or something right?

11:49.193 --> 11:50.726
Yeah.

11:50.728 --> 11:54.565
Like that type of ringing
is just you hear nothing,

11:56.266 --> 11:57.232
or something like that.

11:57.234 --> 11:58.368
Pretty much.

12:00.437 --> 12:02.437
I used to hate that
when I was a kid though.

12:02.439 --> 12:04.006
Oh yeah?

12:04.008 --> 12:07.712
Yeah I just, I don't know
it just really bothered me.

12:09.113 --> 12:12.447
- Huh.
- Still makes me feel weird.

12:12.449 --> 12:13.283
Oh yeah?

12:15.352 --> 12:16.186
Yeah.

12:17.922 --> 12:21.525
I get really sick to
my stomach and sweaty.

12:25.029 --> 12:26.597
It would feel like,

12:28.198 --> 12:31.700
I don't know like what a
black hole would feel like,

12:31.702 --> 12:33.936
or something, can't
really explain it.

12:33.938 --> 12:34.772
Huh.

12:36.807 --> 12:40.075
I get all freaked
out and scared,

12:40.077 --> 12:42.845
so my parents would have
to put on this music

12:42.847 --> 12:46.949
so I would like relax and
eventually fall asleep.

12:46.951 --> 12:49.785
Oh yeah, what type of music
would they play for you?

12:49.787 --> 12:51.754
Didn't matter.

12:51.756 --> 12:55.691
Anything, just like
any sound, any noise

12:55.693 --> 12:58.228
just to drown out that ringing.

13:00.197 --> 13:03.932
Yeah I
don't know I never,

13:03.934 --> 13:07.903
never really had any problems
sleeping when I was a kid,

13:07.905 --> 13:10.572
I was always super afraid
of heights actually.

13:10.574 --> 13:14.142
But yeah, never scared of the
dark or anything like that.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.779
I didn't say I was
cared of the dark.

13:16.781 --> 13:20.050
I don't
know, I don't know.

13:21.819 --> 13:24.419
Its just that sound of like,

13:24.421 --> 13:28.592
the way I feel when I hear
that sound, like nothing.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.876
I'm not trying to freak
you out right now man.

13:50.147 --> 13:52.316
- You're good.
- Alrighty.

13:54.051 --> 13:55.052
Night buddy.

14:05.996 --> 14:08.630
That a boy that a boy.

14:08.632 --> 14:09.433
30 more!

14:33.523 --> 14:37.760
Oh man, you killed that
man, nice work man.

14:37.762 --> 14:38.763
Thank you.

15:01.218 --> 15:02.885
What's up baby boy?

15:02.887 --> 15:03.720
Woo!

15:05.689 --> 15:07.756
Where's the knock back?

15:07.758 --> 15:09.825
Hey nobody can left

15:09.827 --> 15:11.927
Hey you know what
kid you talk too much,

15:11.929 --> 15:13.862

15:13.864 --> 15:15.964
Such a
fucking charity case huh?

15:15.966 --> 15:17.232
What you say?

15:17.234 --> 15:18.100
Hey you
little whipping boy.

15:19.003 --> 15:20.502
Don't take it out on me.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.104
You shut your mouth or I'm
gonna sick the boy on you.

15:22.106 --> 15:24.873
Listen just cause we
got you from make a wish

15:24.875 --> 15:26.374

be all nice to you

15:26.376 --> 15:27.575
you fat fuck.

15:27.577 --> 15:29.344
At least I'm not from
fucking Maple Ridge

15:29.346 --> 15:30.779
you little honky tonk bitch.

15:30.781 --> 15:33.949
You gotta fucking problem,
where you going hey!

15:33.951 --> 15:35.984
Look at you fucking hiding.

15:35.986 --> 15:37.619
Which way you going?

15:37.621 --> 15:39.054
Why don't you take out
what's in front of you?

15:39.056 --> 15:40.823
That's right.

15:41.725 --> 15:42.657
Oh hey watch it.

16:06.350 --> 16:07.184
Fuck yeah!

16:43.653 --> 16:45.055
Busted eh boys?

16:50.427 --> 16:55.397
You boys are lucky this
guy's a lawyer and not a cop.

16:55.399 --> 16:57.902
Relax boys I'm on your side.

16:59.904 --> 17:01.536
These are
the young princes.

17:01.538 --> 17:04.839
Oh, they make a lot
bigger now a days don't they?

17:04.840 --> 17:06.340
No kidding.

17:06.343 --> 17:08.276
Wendy said she wanted to get
a Rottweiler for the house

17:08.278 --> 17:09.810
or something, I said
why don't you just get

17:09.813 --> 17:11.613
a couple of hockey players.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.420
They already come house trained.

17:19.856 --> 17:21.625
More or less eh boys.

17:24.328 --> 17:26.997
Don't worry I won't tell nobody.

17:30.234 --> 17:32.434
K, goodnight fellas.

17:32.436 --> 17:34.671
- Night Bill.
- Night night.

17:49.719 --> 17:51.388
Bricks and mortar.

17:53.090 --> 17:54.191
These things.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.661
They're important right?

17:59.863 --> 18:04.034
They are important because we
are building something here.

18:05.970 --> 18:09.139
We're building
something that is great.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.742
Because at the end of the day,

18:14.744 --> 18:16.511
these things need to be built.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.746
They don't just appear,
there's no magic potion,

18:18.748 --> 18:22.752
there's no shortcuts, but
they have to be built.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.454
Because you're only going
to get out what you put in.

18:26.456 --> 18:28.590
I mean this is why
we work hard right?

18:28.592 --> 18:31.095
This is why we burn and bleed.

18:32.662 --> 18:36.398
To achieve greatness, it's
like we have to take this

18:36.400 --> 18:40.404
rough hewn piece of steel
and we gotta pound it,

18:41.605 --> 18:43.540
until we get Excalibur.

18:45.409 --> 18:47.642
You know that story right?

18:47.644 --> 18:51.079
The story of King
Arthur and the sword.

18:51.081 --> 18:54.818
Well, here's a little
history lesson for you.

18:55.986 --> 18:59.556
Because history my
friends is so important.

19:03.827 --> 19:06.061
Because when you look at the
history books from school

19:06.063 --> 19:07.829
or google or wherever the hell

19:07.831 --> 19:10.898
you get your history
from nowadays,

19:10.900 --> 19:15.072
what's the thing that you
see and remember the most?

19:19.809 --> 19:20.644
Heroes.

19:22.612 --> 19:24.179
Hm?

19:24.181 --> 19:28.016
Because last time I checked,
there isn't any room

19:28.018 --> 19:29.917
in the history books
for losers now is there?

19:29.919 --> 19:30.752
No sir.

19:30.754 --> 19:31.588
No.

19:32.756 --> 19:36.324
Championships, banners,
trophies, all of that,

19:36.326 --> 19:39.361
that was determined by
people who were writing

19:39.363 --> 19:40.864
their own history.

19:44.034 --> 19:46.936
This is the place
where it happens.

19:49.139 --> 19:51.406
Not amongst the glamor
or the spotlights

19:51.408 --> 19:53.241
or how many likes
on your phones,

19:53.243 --> 19:55.245
no, no, no none of that.

19:57.081 --> 19:59.683
Because it's here in this place

20:01.085 --> 20:03.587
where we build our own legacy.

20:06.290 --> 20:08.958
This is where it all comes from.

20:14.698 --> 20:17.201
That's it move him move him.

20:18.568 --> 20:21.969
That's the way, work
for it work for it!

20:21.971 --> 20:24.808
Who wants it more,
that's it good.

20:26.843 --> 20:28.445
Move him out there.

20:31.181 --> 20:34.349
Easy easy, that's it,
it's okay it's okay.

20:34.351 --> 20:36.251
Good amount of aggression there,

20:36.253 --> 20:38.986
that's exactly what we need
when we're in the corners.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.456
Not get in a fight, whoever
wants it most gets it.

20:41.458 --> 20:42.626
Beautiful, go.

20:45.529 --> 20:47.262
That's what I want
to see from you man,

20:47.264 --> 20:49.897
show me that, show
me lots of that.

20:49.899 --> 20:50.700
Next two.

22:28.465 --> 22:29.399
The nose?

22:30.434 --> 22:31.499
No let me see it.

22:31.501 --> 22:32.502
Very cute.

22:33.703 --> 22:35.637
Fucking right I'm cute boys.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.906
Man you're such a dumbass.

22:38.908 --> 22:40.242
Dude I look like I could
beat the shit out of everyone.

22:40.244 --> 22:43.911
Oh yeah?

22:43.913 --> 22:45.847
That's coming from the big
boy that believes in ghosts.

22:45.849 --> 22:47.882
Oh yeah, ghost
whisperer over here.

22:47.884 --> 22:50.585
Alright fuck you guys
cause that shit's real.

22:50.587 --> 22:52.053
So laugh all you want.

22:52.055 --> 22:53.455
What are you talking about?

22:53.457 --> 22:54.889
The hotel in Cranbrook,
he thought he saw.

23:00.864 --> 23:02.129
Alright, fuck you guys.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.798
Next time I'm going
to befriend the ghost

23:03.800 --> 23:05.733
and I'm gonna have him
haunt every last one of you.

23:05.735 --> 23:07.068
Then we'll see who's laughing.

23:10.474 --> 23:12.440
- I got like candles out,
- Yep me and my ghost friend.

23:12.442 --> 23:13.875
Grams and Gramps,
back from the dead.

23:13.877 --> 23:16.143
They got walkers
and dentures and shit.

23:16.145 --> 23:19.314
Howling after us
biting us or something.

23:19.316 --> 23:20.915
Just use your movie method,

23:20.917 --> 23:23.084
you know when you close
your eyes, plug your ears,

23:23.086 --> 23:25.453
and just know that
everything's gonna be okay.

23:25.455 --> 23:27.221
It's gonna be alright.

23:27.223 --> 23:28.290
I thought that was your
method with the ladies.

23:35.765 --> 23:37.701
It's true, it's true.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.343
Yo Cody buddy, hey Cody.

23:51.147 --> 23:52.847
Yeah, what's up?

23:52.849 --> 23:54.582
Do you know how to do this?

23:54.584 --> 23:56.353
Uh maybe let's see.

24:08.231 --> 24:10.534
It's damn near impossible.

24:12.101 --> 24:14.001
Fuck man I don't know.

24:14.003 --> 24:14.902
See.

24:14.904 --> 24:17.038
How do you do yours?

24:17.040 --> 24:20.710
Oh I just I got one
of those clip on ones.

24:24.648 --> 24:25.813
This is ridiculous.

24:25.815 --> 24:27.584
Struggling?

24:29.018 --> 24:29.853
Hey.

25:07.323 --> 25:09.424
Do you want it any longer?

25:09.426 --> 25:11.659
I think that works.

25:11.661 --> 25:12.496
Good.

25:13.397 --> 25:14.228
Thank you.

25:14.230 --> 25:15.399
My pleasure.

25:17.567 --> 25:21.738
You guys will have
to shine your own shoes though.

25:25.108 --> 25:25.942
Come on!

25:27.711 --> 25:31.881
Guys you're going on the open
ice, that's not how you do it!

25:35.752 --> 25:37.020
Come on Kellan!

25:38.688 --> 25:39.523
Same.

25:40.890 --> 25:42.490
Brutal.

25:42.492 --> 25:43.593
Unbelievable.

25:44.461 --> 25:45.294
Come on!

25:48.197 --> 25:50.632
Let's go, bring it up the
boards, up the boards,

25:50.634 --> 25:53.334
I'm not gonna say it again!

25:53.336 --> 25:55.336
Screaming my god
damn head off here.

25:55.338 --> 25:57.805
That's it, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

25:57.807 --> 26:01.308
Is everyone on fucking vacation!

26:01.310 --> 26:04.748
What the fuck is wrong
with you guys huh!

26:05.782 --> 26:08.015
Can somebody please tell me

26:08.017 --> 26:09.984
what the fuck is going
on out there, huh?

26:09.986 --> 26:11.819
One of you guys come on.

26:11.821 --> 26:16.190
Cause I have no fucking
idea what's going on!

26:16.192 --> 26:19.128
Can one of you
enlighten me please?

26:20.464 --> 26:22.830
You are fucking embarrassing
yourselves tonight.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.699
You're embarrassing me,
and you're embarrassing

26:24.701 --> 26:28.872
every single fucking fan
that's out there, watching you.

26:30.239 --> 26:32.474
For some fucking reason
you guys have decided

26:32.476 --> 26:36.377
to stay out of the corner
and off the fucking boards.

26:36.379 --> 26:38.580
And on top of that
they're taking liberties

26:38.582 --> 26:40.347
with our top guys and what
the fuck you guys doing?

26:40.349 --> 26:41.184
Nothing!

26:42.552 --> 26:45.655
They are in our
house for fucks sake.

26:46.823 --> 26:49.090
Our fucking house
for fucks sake!

26:49.092 --> 26:51.893
Protect the fucking house!

26:51.895 --> 26:54.629
Will somebody wake the fuck up?

27:26.530 --> 27:29.363
Let's go warriors!

27:29.365 --> 27:30.867
Let's go warriors.

27:50.854 --> 27:52.219
Break it up,
break it up boys!

27:52.221 --> 27:53.056
Let go.

27:55.692 --> 27:56.593
We're done.

28:03.466 --> 28:04.365
You're done.

28:04.367 --> 28:05.533
How am I done?

28:05.535 --> 28:06.834
You're done,
hitting from behind.

28:06.836 --> 28:08.069
They're jumping on me.

28:08.071 --> 28:11.775
Let's go, you're done,
you want another game?

28:13.810 --> 28:15.509
To the dressing room let's go.

28:15.511 --> 28:17.779
Wait what about this guy?

28:17.781 --> 28:20.281
To the dressing room.

28:20.283 --> 28:21.883
Hey!

28:21.885 --> 28:26.055
Dressing room or
you get another game, go.

28:47.877 --> 28:49.877
What the fuck was that about?

28:49.879 --> 28:51.078
Don't worry about it.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.313
These guys are
fucking all over me,

28:52.315 --> 28:53.380
I didn't know what the
fuck was happening.

28:53.382 --> 28:54.882
I didn't know what was going on.

28:54.884 --> 28:56.350
- I know, it's okay.
- I'm going back.

28:56.352 --> 28:58.385
- Calm down.
- Move Coach get off me!

28:58.387 --> 29:01.823
Calm down, take
it easy, stop it!

29:01.825 --> 29:02.990
You're not going back out there

29:02.992 --> 29:04.458
it's a bit of a cirus right now.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.728
What the fuck man, these
guys are jumping all over me!

29:06.730 --> 29:09.296
Take a breath, calm down.

29:09.298 --> 29:11.198
- What happened?
- Shh.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.834
What happened out
there to this kid?

29:12.836 --> 29:14.568
I'm looking around he's
not getting up off the ice,

29:14.570 --> 29:16.938
- what happened?
- They're loading him up.

29:16.940 --> 29:18.405
Is he okay?

29:18.407 --> 29:19.573
We don't know yet, he's
going to the hospital.

29:19.575 --> 29:21.042
They'll check him out.

29:21.044 --> 29:22.443
Just take it easy.

29:22.445 --> 29:24.779
Let's go get changed.

29:24.781 --> 29:26.681
Let's get you
changed up, come on.

29:26.683 --> 29:27.516
Oh shit.

29:31.587 --> 29:33.422
Get you a lift home.

30:07.757 --> 30:10.426
Hey Coach, it's Tyson calling.

30:11.861 --> 30:13.360
I just wanted to get you
on the phone and check in,

30:13.362 --> 30:15.830
see what's going on.

30:15.832 --> 30:18.766
I guess I'm gonna see you
guys this afternoon anyways,

30:18.768 --> 30:22.937
but I never got a chance to
talk to anyone since last night.

30:22.939 --> 30:25.875
Yeah, so I just
wanted to check in.

30:28.945 --> 30:33.116
Just give me a shout back when
you can, please thank you.

32:24.327 --> 32:26.830
Hey Tyson, come in here man.

32:29.065 --> 32:31.498
I was just wandering
around downstairs there.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.901
Didn't see anybody, but

32:33.903 --> 32:36.670
I was trying to figure
out what's going on.

32:36.672 --> 32:38.305
Haven't really had a chance
here to talk to anybody

32:38.307 --> 32:40.107
since last night.

32:40.109 --> 32:42.877
I know, we know, well things
have been pretty chaotic

32:42.879 --> 32:44.946
around here as you can imagine.

32:44.948 --> 32:46.513
Everybody's got
their mind on you.

32:46.515 --> 32:50.351
It's been wacky the last
16 hours, let me tell you.

32:50.353 --> 32:55.156
But, we have a number of
issues we have to weed through,

32:55.158 --> 32:58.860
with the league,
and the media right.

32:58.862 --> 33:00.729
Yeah I know for sure.

33:02.231 --> 33:06.100
I'm just wondering what I
can do, what I should do.

33:06.102 --> 33:08.269
Honestly probably the
best thing you could do

33:08.271 --> 33:10.104
is just take it easy.

33:10.106 --> 33:11.973
Go lay low, alright.

33:11.975 --> 33:13.807
You don't need to be talking
to anybody about this.

33:13.809 --> 33:15.877
Don't need to concern
yourself with any of this.

33:15.879 --> 33:17.578
We got people to take
care of that, right?

33:17.580 --> 33:18.414
Yep.

33:23.519 --> 33:24.353
How is he?

33:28.124 --> 33:30.059
He's in the hospital.

33:31.961 --> 33:33.562
That's all we know.

33:38.902 --> 33:43.072
Hey listen man, around here
we're worried about you alright.

33:44.740 --> 33:48.411
Worried about making
sure you're good to go.

33:50.246 --> 33:52.581
So just try to take it easy.

33:57.086 --> 33:58.585
You alright?

33:58.587 --> 33:59.753
Yeah.

33:59.755 --> 34:00.589
Yeah?

34:03.226 --> 34:06.429
Yeah it's just a
little overwhelming.

34:10.233 --> 34:13.600
Well uh, things are
getting pretty chaotic.

34:13.601 --> 34:15.002
Gotta get back to business here.

34:15.004 --> 34:16.603
Back to work, but uh.

34:16.605 --> 34:18.505
Thanks for seeing me,
and taking the time.

34:18.507 --> 34:20.041
I appreciate it.

34:20.043 --> 34:23.043
Oh yeah, like I said man,
just take it easy, alright?

34:23.045 --> 34:24.880
And you'll be alright.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.719
The game
came to a disturbing end

34:33.722 --> 34:36.623
after a violent hit by
Prince's defenseman Tyson Burr

34:36.625 --> 34:40.962
left Cheif's player Kyle
Ridlowe critically injured.

34:40.964 --> 34:42.596
I don't
know exactly what

34:42.598 --> 34:44.364
his condition is right now,

34:44.367 --> 34:46.969
we have not heard specifically.

34:48.304 --> 34:50.873
All I can say right now is that

34:52.108 --> 34:55.641
all of our hearts and
prayers are with Kyle.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.143
This
morning doctors said

34:57.146 --> 34:58.579
that Ridlowe was
in stable condition

34:58.581 --> 35:00.581
but the extent of his
injuries are severe.

35:00.583 --> 35:02.883
The hit left him with
a broken vertebrae

35:02.885 --> 35:05.086
as well as hemorrhaging
in his brain.

35:05.088 --> 35:09.723
In a moment the young
man's life changed forever.

35:09.725 --> 35:12.728
It's
disgusting, disgusting.

35:14.797 --> 35:16.966
How is that a hockey play?

35:18.367 --> 35:22.369
They're down in the
third, down by five.

35:22.371 --> 35:23.439
Five nothing.

35:26.775 --> 35:30.513
Nobody can tell me that
that's a hockey play.

35:36.852 --> 35:38.719
You scared me.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.323
Sorry about that.

36:02.545 --> 36:04.547
I don't know what to do.

36:10.753 --> 36:11.754
I feel like,

36:15.024 --> 36:16.125
I don't know.

36:20.863 --> 36:25.399
Just feel like I'm messed
up or something you know?

36:25.401 --> 36:26.900
Like sick.

36:26.902 --> 36:28.469
Well there's Tylenol and
all that in the kitchen.

36:28.471 --> 36:32.241
Do you need something,
you can help yourself.

37:06.109 --> 37:08.975
Have any need to
be inconvenienced at all.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.046
Appreciate that.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.850
Hey Tyson.

37:16.852 --> 37:17.853
Hey coach.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.121
Well it's
good to see you.

37:20.123 --> 37:22.022
Yeah
likewise, I gotta run

37:22.024 --> 37:24.225
but I'm sure we'll talk soon.

37:24.227 --> 37:25.192
Hey Bill take care.

37:25.194 --> 37:26.660
See you soon.

37:26.662 --> 37:30.366
Tyson, why don't
you come have a seat.

37:31.767 --> 37:32.599
How you doing Tyson?

37:32.601 --> 37:33.869
Good, thanks.

37:35.604 --> 37:37.438
Tyson, this is Elliot
Carr, he's an attorney.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.973
He does some specific
work for the organization

37:39.975 --> 37:41.175
from time to time.

37:41.177 --> 37:42.343
Pleased to meet you Tyson.

37:42.345 --> 37:43.577
Nice to meet you.

37:43.579 --> 37:44.845
Elliot's just here to
go over a few things.

37:44.847 --> 37:47.183
Some technical detail stuff.

37:51.454 --> 37:55.391
So the league is reviewing
this whole incident.

37:56.825 --> 37:58.359
And we've been speaking
back and forth with them,

37:58.361 --> 38:00.594
and well we've been
waiting to hear back

38:00.596 --> 38:03.597
about any disciplinary action.

38:03.599 --> 38:05.199
We've been looking
into our options

38:05.201 --> 38:07.334
and we've decided to make
some organizational decisions

38:07.336 --> 38:09.872
based on the current situation.

38:11.440 --> 38:15.511
At this point, we're
suspending you indefinitely.

38:18.781 --> 38:22.149
I know that's not what
you wanted to hear,

38:22.151 --> 38:26.222
but you need to see this
as an act of good faith.

38:27.423 --> 38:29.456
This is a chance for the
team to show the league

38:29.458 --> 38:31.458
that we're willing to
take responsibility

38:31.460 --> 38:33.396
for what happened here.

38:36.865 --> 38:38.467
- Okay.
- Okay good.

38:39.868 --> 38:41.402
Now this is all just
part of the process.

38:41.404 --> 38:42.969
We just have to make
sure that everybody

38:42.971 --> 38:45.308
comes out alright here okay?

38:47.176 --> 38:49.410
Now to make this easier,

38:49.412 --> 38:52.346
Elliot has drafted up
a statement for you

38:52.348 --> 38:55.249
for the team to
release on your behalf.

38:55.251 --> 38:59.520
Um, I can read it for
you now, if you like Tyson.

38:59.522 --> 39:01.021
Please, yeah please.

39:01.023 --> 39:02.989
We just want to
get it out there.

39:02.991 --> 39:04.925
Be able to put it
out there right away.

39:04.927 --> 39:05.928
Of course.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.635
First and foremost, I
wish to extend my heartfelt

39:14.637 --> 39:17.103
thoughts and sympathies
to Kyle Ridlowe

39:17.105 --> 39:20.774
and his family, his
friends, and his teammates.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.976
My prayers are with each
and every one of them

39:22.978 --> 39:24.913
in this difficult time.

39:26.181 --> 39:28.782
I'm profoundly sorry
for both the physical

39:28.784 --> 39:31.151
and emotional hurt I have caused

39:31.153 --> 39:35.389
and I cannot forgive myself
for inflicting these wounds,

39:35.391 --> 39:38.459
but I can try my very best
to take full responsibility

39:38.461 --> 39:39.695
for my actions.

39:40.896 --> 39:44.197
I also wish to issue an
apology to my teammates,

39:44.199 --> 39:48.371
my team, our fans and the
entire city of Prince George.

39:50.539 --> 39:53.740
What happened on Friday night
was not at all reflective

39:53.742 --> 39:58.445
of the values or culture of
the Prince George Warriors.

39:58.447 --> 40:00.847
And I am very sorry that
my individual actions

40:00.849 --> 40:04.485
have cast such a dark
shadow over the organization

40:04.487 --> 40:05.952
and this city.

40:05.954 --> 40:10.457
I'm prepared to be fully
accountable for what I have done

40:10.459 --> 40:12.793
and hope that
through this process

40:12.795 --> 40:16.865
am able to repair some of
the damage I have cost.

40:18.301 --> 40:19.566
Now this
is a chance for you

40:19.568 --> 40:22.269
to get out in front
of this thing okay?

40:22.271 --> 40:24.638
We can put this
out there for you,

40:24.640 --> 40:28.775
and all you need to
do is step back okay?

40:28.777 --> 40:30.243
You don't need to
talk to anyone,

40:30.245 --> 40:32.646
or do anything alright?

40:32.648 --> 40:33.482
Alright.

40:36.685 --> 40:37.984
I didn't mean for
that to happen.

40:37.986 --> 40:40.787
Hey, we're
not here to judge

40:40.789 --> 40:43.357
the way you play the game, okay?

40:43.359 --> 40:45.492
We're just here to help.

40:45.494 --> 40:46.295
I know.

40:47.930 --> 40:49.164
Thank you guys.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.866
Guess I just feel bad you know?

40:52.868 --> 40:54.169
I know you do.

40:55.438 --> 40:58.173
And this, this
says you do, okay?

41:04.513 --> 41:05.314
Yeah.

41:09.518 --> 41:11.420
How long is indefinite?

41:14.222 --> 41:17.591
We'll have
to wait and see.

41:17.593 --> 41:18.427
Okay.

41:22.064 --> 41:24.297
Nice talking with
you Tyson, take care.

41:24.299 --> 41:25.300
Thank you.

41:27.135 --> 41:28.369
We'll
see you again soon.

41:28.371 --> 41:29.705
You bet Coach.

43:04.399 --> 43:05.832
Hey Bill.

43:05.834 --> 43:06.635
Hey.

43:18.981 --> 43:19.815
Listen,

43:22.585 --> 43:26.755
I've spoken with Wendy over
the last couple of days here,

43:30.926 --> 43:34.697
after discussing things
we feel at this point

43:35.564 --> 43:36.897
it would be appropriate for you

43:36.899 --> 43:39.401
to find another place to stay.

43:46.809 --> 43:49.878
I don't really
have anywhere to go.

43:51.346 --> 43:55.048
Look, we're not trying to
complicate things here but,

43:55.050 --> 43:56.485
this is our home.

43:58.821 --> 44:01.156
I got priorities to our son.

44:02.558 --> 44:04.392
And with that in mind,

44:05.994 --> 44:09.898
I don't feel comfortable
having you around here.

44:11.767 --> 44:13.936
Yeah, I understand that.

44:16.071 --> 44:16.905
I uh,

44:19.407 --> 44:22.244
I'll figure something
out, I will.

44:23.879 --> 44:25.445
I'm not telling
you to pack your bags

44:25.447 --> 44:29.883
right this minute and get out
on the street tonight but,

44:29.885 --> 44:33.353
by tomorrow you need to
have your situation sorted.

44:33.355 --> 44:34.523
That's fair.

44:39.327 --> 44:43.331
Like I say, my
responsibility is to my family.

44:46.602 --> 44:49.369
I don't want people coming
around knocking on my door

44:49.371 --> 44:51.204
and I don't want to explain
what the commotion is

44:51.206 --> 44:53.239
to my son, you know?

44:53.241 --> 44:55.709
He's just a kid, he's
young, he's impressionable.

44:55.711 --> 44:56.879
Yeah I know.

44:58.413 --> 45:03.083
He needs positive role
models around here and not,

45:03.085 --> 45:05.253
this other stuff you know.

45:06.354 --> 45:07.189
Yep.

45:11.994 --> 45:15.598
So I'm a fair
person you know but,

45:16.799 --> 45:19.868
my family always
comes first, always.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.206
Always you know.

45:26.208 --> 45:27.442
Yeah, I know.

45:29.712 --> 45:30.979
I respect that.

45:43.425 --> 45:44.324
Hey brother.

45:44.326 --> 45:45.493
Hey brother.

45:54.937 --> 45:57.103
Alright, so that's you.

45:57.105 --> 45:59.472
Perfect man, thank again.

45:59.474 --> 46:01.541
That's alright.

46:01.543 --> 46:04.144
So you just gonna
chill for a bit, or what

46:04.146 --> 46:06.246
cause we gotta head to the
rink pretty quick here.

46:06.248 --> 46:09.752
Yeah I'll probably
step out or something.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.654
Well if you want to shower
you know where it is right?

46:13.656 --> 46:16.089
Yeah I know, just back there.

46:16.091 --> 46:17.592
- Cool.
- Cool man.

46:18.961 --> 46:22.462
Yeah I'm gonna get
going, talk to you later.

46:22.464 --> 46:25.634
- See you later buddy.
- Yeah see you.

46:27.870 --> 46:28.902
Take it easy okay?

46:28.904 --> 46:31.239
Yeah man, have a good one.

49:05.193 --> 49:08.394
Dude for real, she's the best.

49:09.865 --> 49:12.134
Tron fucking broke.

49:14.202 --> 49:17.303
Oh my god, Tronda's
fucking broke.

49:17.305 --> 49:19.705
Danger cat.

49:19.707 --> 49:21.507
Is a danger cat.

49:25.848 --> 49:27.447
Get any
refills for you guys?

49:27.449 --> 49:28.616
Good thanks.

49:32.754 --> 49:35.188
And the second one
when they go to the screamer.

49:35.190 --> 49:37.123
Yeah that's the one!

49:39.995 --> 49:42.528
As a kid I was up
there, I remember,

49:42.530 --> 49:46.268
fucking knees shaking,
scared out of my mind.

49:48.170 --> 49:50.170
After my grandma when,

49:50.172 --> 49:53.006
it went straight all
the way up the sign.

49:53.008 --> 49:55.708
Granny.

49:55.710 --> 49:59.481
It was so bad that I
puked, shit and puked.

50:03.051 --> 50:05.387
I know man I'm such a pussy.

50:11.459 --> 50:12.692
There's your change.

50:12.694 --> 50:16.064
Thank you sweetie, oh
it's right this time.

50:26.441 --> 50:28.674
I'd wash your hands first.

50:28.676 --> 50:30.210
What's that buddy?

50:30.212 --> 50:31.644
I wasn't talking to you
disgraceful piece of shit.

50:31.646 --> 50:33.413
Hey fuck you!

50:33.415 --> 50:34.881
Whoa, whoa!

50:34.883 --> 50:37.918
Fuck you!

50:37.920 --> 50:39.087
Hey hey hey!

50:40.889 --> 50:42.724
Get off my property!

50:58.907 --> 51:01.207
Fuck you sack of shit.

51:01.209 --> 51:02.110
Fuck you!

51:11.920 --> 51:12.921
Burr, woo!

51:15.490 --> 51:18.124
You know next time I'll let
you knock him out alright.

51:18.126 --> 51:20.660
That's right baby, damn
that was a good one.

51:20.662 --> 51:21.663
Fuck yeah!

52:18.786 --> 52:19.621
Hey man.

52:20.488 --> 52:21.823
What's up man?

52:24.426 --> 52:25.360
Not much.

52:27.329 --> 52:28.663
Where's Derek?

52:30.198 --> 52:31.866
He's already gone.

52:38.773 --> 52:40.873
Is that right.

52:40.875 --> 52:41.709
Yeah,

52:43.311 --> 52:46.981
coach wants to see us
both earlier today so.

52:51.053 --> 52:52.454
You gotta bounce.

52:57.359 --> 52:58.260
Yeah man.

53:00.262 --> 53:01.396
See you later.

53:03.398 --> 53:04.199
Yeah.

57:43.678 --> 57:44.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:53.114 --> 58:54.547
So what's your plan?

58:54.549 --> 58:56.050
He's gonna work.

58:57.385 --> 58:59.351
Yeah, I'm gonna go
see Hank tomorrow,

58:59.353 --> 59:01.286
see if he's got
any shifts for me

59:01.288 --> 59:02.388
over at the slaughter house.

59:02.390 --> 59:03.823
Good.

59:03.825 --> 59:05.525
I'll also get you working
on the old property.

59:05.527 --> 59:08.060
Haven't any time to get to that.

59:08.062 --> 59:10.229
Gotta rip down that fence.

59:10.231 --> 59:12.632
Get all the wrecks
off the acreage

59:12.634 --> 59:16.035
and finally tackle
that house, finally.

59:16.037 --> 59:17.269
Yeah for sure.

59:17.271 --> 59:18.540
I'll stay busy.

59:20.808 --> 59:24.979
It's probably just going to
be for a little while anyway.

59:28.349 --> 59:31.352
Well it's
nice you're home.

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:26.806
Hey Coach it's Tyson calling,

01:00:26.808 --> 01:00:29.842
I was just hoping to
have a chat with you

01:00:29.844 --> 01:00:32.478
when you get a moment.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.048
I've been taking some time
to straighten myself out here

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:39.819
and yeah I'm really looking
forward to getting back

01:00:39.821 --> 01:00:43.623
and contributing and just
being a part of the team,

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:45.392
helping you guys out.

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:50.596
Yeah, just looking forward
to getting back out there.

01:00:50.598 --> 01:00:54.900
So if you could give me a shout
back when you get a chance

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:58.706
that would be really
great, alright thank you.

01:03:19.246 --> 01:03:22.349
Gotta clear
everything out of here.

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:28.087
May as well start
in the living room.

01:03:28.089 --> 01:03:29.924
Look at this, garbage.

01:03:36.097 --> 01:03:38.833
And the bathroom
I guess, stinks.

01:03:39.934 --> 01:03:40.768
It's crap.

01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:47.372
Keep anything of
value, metal, copper,

01:03:47.374 --> 01:03:49.110
toss it in the truck.

01:03:50.044 --> 01:03:50.878
Whatever.

01:03:55.282 --> 01:03:57.351
Whatever you can salvage.

01:04:00.822 --> 01:04:05.124
Thought of tackling this eyesore
just gives me a headache.

01:04:05.126 --> 01:04:07.026
Anyway I'll talk to the
guy and see what day

01:04:07.028 --> 01:04:08.493
the can actually take her down.

01:04:08.495 --> 01:04:09.962
Alright.

01:04:09.964 --> 01:04:12.564
Just, do the best you can.

01:04:12.566 --> 01:04:13.400
Yep.

01:04:14.902 --> 01:04:15.737
Alright.

01:05:29.443 --> 01:05:31.676
At one point she had two kids

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:33.712
and I guess she was
jealous of me sleeping.

01:05:33.714 --> 01:05:36.081
I didn't get much sleep,
I had to work the next day

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:37.783
for Popolson, and I was driving

01:05:37.785 --> 01:05:40.452
from Prince George to
Smithers on a coastal run.

01:05:40.454 --> 01:05:41.753
Popolson's
a good company.

01:05:41.755 --> 01:05:43.588
I got a buddy work for them.

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.190
It's not too bad.

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:46.458
I'd say good good.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.726
Yeah?

01:05:47.728 --> 01:05:50.429
I told Jack, he
decided to retire.

01:05:50.431 --> 01:05:51.997
Oh okay.

01:05:51.999 --> 01:05:54.166
Harold was in order
but Jack took off.

01:05:54.168 --> 01:05:55.901
Right?

01:05:55.903 --> 01:06:00.039
So anyway I was driving
form Houston to Smithers

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:02.707
thinking I wasn't that tired,

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.543
ended up doing a little
bit of the blinks,

01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:06.011
going down the road.

01:06:06.013 --> 01:06:08.480
Whoa whoa, you gotta come out
and play hockey tonight man.

01:06:08.482 --> 01:06:10.349
Don't forget they
guys gotta see you.

01:06:10.351 --> 01:06:14.088
I know, Phil was saying
something about it.

01:06:15.222 --> 01:06:16.055
Yeah, I might do that.

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:17.622
Yeah, new age hockey.

01:06:17.624 --> 01:06:19.058
Skates with a walker.

01:06:24.966 --> 01:06:26.832
I'll have my head up.

01:06:32.073 --> 01:06:34.406
You'll like it, they're
a good bunch of guys man,

01:06:34.408 --> 01:06:35.676
you'll like it.

01:07:51.418 --> 01:07:54.253
No I mean I went to
one game, it was a gift.

01:07:54.255 --> 01:07:56.421
I don't know, I'd
rather watch it on TV.

01:07:56.423 --> 01:07:59.994
I went to a Buffalo
Sabers game growing up,

01:08:01.228 --> 01:08:04.999
versus Toronto and then
I like being at home.

01:11:15.122 --> 01:11:17.791
Hey, somebody come here!

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:21.526
I want to talk to somebody!

01:11:29.803 --> 01:11:30.637
Hey!

01:11:31.605 --> 01:11:34.706
I'm waiting here, come here!

01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:44.485
Hey!

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:50.989
Hey!

01:11:50.991 --> 01:11:54.060
Somebody hey!

01:11:58.432 --> 01:12:00.732
I know you can hear me!

01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:03.868
I know you can hear me!

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:07.908
Come here and talk to me!

01:12:49.483 --> 01:12:51.051
This is my house.

01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:57.591
This is our home.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.960
We built this place,
and you need to show

01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:04.498
some god damn respect for that.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:14.105
You just don't seem
to get it do you?

01:13:14.107 --> 01:13:15.774
You have all these
people out there

01:13:15.776 --> 01:13:19.411
bending over backwards
trying to help you.

01:13:19.413 --> 01:13:23.584
And you just keep shoveling
shit back in their faces.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.088
Do you have any idea what we've
been though because of you?

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:31.425
Any idea at all?

01:13:33.694 --> 01:13:37.264
The embarrassment, the
fucking humiliation!

01:13:38.899 --> 01:13:39.733
Do you?

01:13:41.568 --> 01:13:43.069
That's a question!

01:13:56.717 --> 01:13:58.151
You need to learn

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:02.856
to take some responsibility
for you actions.

01:14:04.425 --> 01:14:06.760
You're not a god damn child.

01:14:08.094 --> 01:14:09.963
Get your shit together.

01:15:24.538 --> 01:15:26.973
Please dial 374.

01:15:33.647 --> 01:15:36.415
You've
reached Coach Weller,

01:15:36.417 --> 01:15:39.252
please leave a
message, thank you.

01:15:46.259 --> 01:15:49.227
Is the window for style
points here or what?

01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:52.330
No it was just an accident.

01:15:52.332 --> 01:15:54.265
I say you just chop
the roof altogether man

01:15:54.267 --> 01:15:58.104
and rock a little
convertible action you know?

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.074
Oh I'm on a budget.

01:16:02.943 --> 01:16:03.775
Tyson.

01:16:03.777 --> 01:16:04.609
Tyson, Eric.

01:16:04.611 --> 01:16:05.844
Nice to meet you.

01:16:05.846 --> 01:16:09.313
What happened to
your hand there bud?

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:10.584
It's like um.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.054
You know man don't
even worry about it.

01:16:16.056 --> 01:16:17.021
Shit happens you know.

01:16:17.023 --> 01:16:19.157
Yeah shit happens.

01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:20.158
So you
from around here?

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.260
Yep, I was away for awhile

01:16:22.262 --> 01:16:24.663
but now I'm back
for a little bit.

01:16:24.665 --> 01:16:27.031
Well you picked the proper
spot for a vacation huh?

01:16:27.033 --> 01:16:27.868
Yeah.

01:16:29.169 --> 01:16:30.068
See you back in there.

01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.904
Alright.

01:17:03.336 --> 01:17:04.170
Ah, fuck!

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.874
Ah!

01:17:28.929 --> 01:17:29.763
Oh fuck.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:18.970
What's up man?

01:19:18.972 --> 01:19:19.806
Hey.

01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:25.276
So you get that window fixed?

01:19:25.278 --> 01:19:26.911
Not yet, nope.

01:19:26.913 --> 01:19:30.014
Gonna take her in sometime soon.

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:32.150
Yeah I could have a
look at it if you like?

01:19:32.152 --> 01:19:34.452
Do you do that kind of stuff?

01:19:34.454 --> 01:19:36.855
I dabble, a little bit of
this, a little bit of that.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:37.691
Yeah.

01:19:41.762 --> 01:19:43.862
How'd you end up here?

01:19:43.864 --> 01:19:48.833
I was working a rig about
150 clicks north of here,

01:19:48.835 --> 01:19:52.170
I was just sick and
tired of the rat race.

01:19:52.172 --> 01:19:54.107
Had big plans you know.

01:19:55.341 --> 01:19:56.841
Shacked up with the old lady,

01:19:56.843 --> 01:19:59.010
I wanted to take that extra
step and get a house going

01:19:59.012 --> 01:20:02.647
and maybe get a couple little
young ones running around.

01:20:02.649 --> 01:20:03.982
Nine months in she
went and started

01:20:03.984 --> 01:20:07.018
a whole new life without me so.

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.919
Shit man.

01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:10.288
Kind of shook up.

01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:11.589
Sucks.

01:20:11.591 --> 01:20:13.593
What are you gonna do?

01:20:14.627 --> 01:20:16.160
At least I got out of there,

01:20:16.162 --> 01:20:18.562
it was such a dark place,
you need to stay focused,

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.699
stay positive you know?

01:20:20.701 --> 01:20:23.735
Take the good with
the bad you know?

01:20:23.737 --> 01:20:24.570
Yep.

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:35.013
Should probably get
back to work huh?

01:20:35.015 --> 01:20:38.018
Yeah you should
get back in there.

01:21:29.235 --> 01:21:30.070
Hey!

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.995
Yeah it totally
seems doable man.

01:23:36.997 --> 01:23:38.462
I mean I've never done
anything like this before,

01:23:38.464 --> 01:23:40.364
but doesn't seem impossible.

01:23:40.366 --> 01:23:41.599
That'd be wicked man.

01:23:41.601 --> 01:23:43.167
How much would you
charge for that?

01:23:43.169 --> 01:23:44.635
I don't know like a
hundred bones maybe,

01:23:44.637 --> 01:23:47.705
you wouldn't have to cover
much after parts and stuff so.

01:23:47.707 --> 01:23:49.373
Definitely.

01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:51.309
I could place an
order on Monday.

01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:52.476
Yeah.

01:23:52.478 --> 01:23:53.677
I would probably
take a couple of weeks.

01:23:53.679 --> 01:23:55.914
Rolling with the Saran
wrap until then so.

01:23:59.719 --> 01:24:02.120
Cool man, well you
wanna come in for a beer?

01:24:02.122 --> 01:24:04.224
Yeah, I could have one.

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:24.175
So you found the bathroom
alright in my mansion?

01:24:24.177 --> 01:24:27.145
You should see the fucking
place I'm working on.

01:24:27.147 --> 01:24:29.981
What you got a little
rental job on the go?

01:24:29.983 --> 01:24:33.084
Yeah, it's basically
like this scrap job

01:24:33.086 --> 01:24:34.818
on one of our properties.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.821
Just trying to pull whatever
we can out of there you know.

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:40.891
Collect from the floors, walls.

01:24:40.893 --> 01:24:43.327
Most of it's rusted to shit.

01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:47.065
Woods all finished but
there's a few things.

01:24:47.067 --> 01:24:50.201
And after that we're just gonna
knock it down for pasture.

01:24:50.203 --> 01:24:51.502
Total salvage mission eh?

01:24:51.504 --> 01:24:52.338
Mm hmm.

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:57.208
Nice, has it been in
your family for years?

01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:59.479
Yeah, it's my Godparents.

01:25:00.646 --> 01:25:05.349
But no one's lived there
after my Grandpa died.

01:25:05.351 --> 01:25:07.453
It's been empty for ages.

01:25:10.023 --> 01:25:12.190
You grew up there as a tyke?

01:25:12.192 --> 01:25:15.793
I spend a lot of time
there when I was younger.

01:25:15.795 --> 01:25:19.530
But it's like early
memories you know?

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:22.300
Never really met my Grandma.

01:25:22.302 --> 01:25:25.569
My Grandpa died when
I was really young.

01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:29.575
And him and my Dad had
this weird kind of thing.

01:25:31.177 --> 01:25:34.945
It was kind of old school
military guy right.

01:25:34.947 --> 01:25:37.850
So they had their
problems I guess.

01:25:40.153 --> 01:25:43.921
So after he died we didn't
really hang out there too much.

01:25:43.923 --> 01:25:46.657
It's like a place that's
always been left alone.

01:25:46.659 --> 01:25:48.526
Out of sight our of
mind kind of thing.

01:25:48.528 --> 01:25:49.362
Mm hmm.

01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:53.631
So how'd you grandpa pass?

01:25:53.633 --> 01:25:55.566
Throat cancer.

01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:57.068
Throat cancer eh?

01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:58.571
Yep, rough shit.

01:25:59.772 --> 01:26:00.606
Yeah.

01:26:02.542 --> 01:26:04.975
I can totally relate.

01:26:04.977 --> 01:26:09.082
I was in the hospital and I
had this young guy beside me

01:26:10.516 --> 01:26:14.952
that had a trach, and his
breathing would be fine

01:26:14.954 --> 01:26:16.987
and then about a half an
hour into it you could hear a

01:26:18.424 --> 01:26:20.291
you know it was the flem
buildup so they would come in

01:26:20.293 --> 01:26:22.860
with a tube and
stick it in his trach

01:26:22.862 --> 01:26:24.764
suck out all this flem.

01:26:26.332 --> 01:26:27.631
Yeah.

01:26:27.633 --> 01:26:31.035
And meanwhile I'm just
like, shut the fuck up!

01:26:31.037 --> 01:26:34.638
I'm trying to sleep, go die
somewhere else you know.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.078
Just being totally
delirious of the fact.

01:26:39.579 --> 01:26:43.214
And two days in, the next
night, following night,

01:26:43.216 --> 01:26:44.882
wake up in the morning
and I'm usually woken up

01:26:44.884 --> 01:26:47.518
by this suction of
this tube and whatever

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.688
and I look over and
the bed was gone.

01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:53.091
I ask the nurse
and I yell nurse,

01:26:53.093 --> 01:26:56.627
what happened to the
little kipper her.

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:58.429
And the nurse it like
yeah, didn't make it,

01:26:58.431 --> 01:27:00.698
you know and whatever,
throat cancer got him.

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.233
And I was just like, what?

01:27:02.235 --> 01:27:05.436
I'm being me being six years
old, I'm like holy fuck man,

01:27:05.438 --> 01:27:07.004
that's heavy.

01:27:07.006 --> 01:27:09.842
Dying, he just died
right there man

01:27:11.511 --> 01:27:14.378
What you end up in there for?

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.881
I actually like, I was
in a coma for two months.

01:27:17.883 --> 01:27:19.217
No way.

01:27:19.219 --> 01:27:22.220
Yeah dude, I
survived the coma,

01:27:22.222 --> 01:27:24.888
and yeah it was pretty heavy.

01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:29.059
My mom organized this
parade in Fort Mac

01:27:29.061 --> 01:27:32.062
when I was living up
there and the theme was

01:27:32.064 --> 01:27:33.999
cowboys versus indians.

01:27:35.435 --> 01:27:37.435
Well of course me being
an indian I came prepared

01:27:37.437 --> 01:27:41.739
with my bustles you
know, my pow wow regalia,

01:27:41.741 --> 01:27:44.477
my gear you know,
totally jiving.

01:27:46.179 --> 01:27:49.046
And then all of a
sudden, it stops.

01:27:49.048 --> 01:27:50.414
And we're like
what's the hold up

01:27:50.416 --> 01:27:51.815
and we look over there.

01:27:51.817 --> 01:27:54.852
Here like someone was,
there was some holdup.

01:27:54.854 --> 01:27:57.988
So I just kick back,
waving at the same people

01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:00.124
doing whatever, and
then it violently shook

01:28:00.126 --> 01:28:02.593
and I went flying eight
feet off this platform.

01:28:02.595 --> 01:28:06.766
Right onto my head, like
smacked my dome and everything.

01:28:08.734 --> 01:28:12.736
The driver behind us in the,
passed like the following,

01:28:12.738 --> 01:28:14.338
18 wheeler didn't even see me

01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.540
and it straight just
ran my leg over,

01:28:16.542 --> 01:28:17.941
crushed it in seven place.

01:28:17.943 --> 01:28:18.876
Oh fuck.

01:28:18.878 --> 01:28:20.244
I was unconscious you know.

01:28:20.246 --> 01:28:21.181
God damn.

01:28:22.348 --> 01:28:24.582
Gretzky came and saw
me in the hospital,

01:28:24.584 --> 01:28:27.585
you know, Gretzky
straight up showed up.

01:28:27.587 --> 01:28:28.486
The great one.

01:28:29.489 --> 01:28:30.988
I'm all tubed up like totally,

01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.557
like sheets across they way,
full of tubes and everything.

01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:36.427
There's Gretzky puts
down a home jersey

01:28:36.429 --> 01:28:39.163
and an away jersey and
that's the photo I have.

01:28:39.165 --> 01:28:43.667
Smiling for the camera while
he's autographing these jerseys

01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:45.403
and I'm fucking, I got
a little teddy bear

01:28:45.405 --> 01:28:48.639
stuffed under my arm, I'm
fucking out of it you know?

01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:53.711
I'm gonna go grab
another beer alright.

01:29:11.297 --> 01:29:12.965
I'm fucked up man.

01:29:14.867 --> 01:29:16.802
I'm just fucked up man.

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.540
You alright there buddy?

01:29:22.542 --> 01:29:24.644
Yeah, I just fucked up.

01:29:26.712 --> 01:29:28.714
You'll be alright man.

01:29:31.451 --> 01:29:34.151
Just fucked up you know.

01:29:34.153 --> 01:29:38.224
I was just drinking too
much, fucked up you know.

01:29:40.526 --> 01:29:42.262
You'll be fine bro.

01:29:43.263 --> 01:29:44.096
Yep.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.101
No worries.

01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:52.738
Everything's gonna be fine man.

01:29:55.275 --> 01:29:56.108
Yep.

01:31:17.857 --> 01:31:20.157
Do you need
a ride on Thursday?

01:31:20.159 --> 01:31:22.828
No that's alright I can drive.

01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:26.997
Do you want a ride?

01:31:26.999 --> 01:31:28.233
No thank you.

01:31:29.469 --> 01:31:30.302
Okay.

01:35:43.322 --> 01:35:46.757
How's everything
looking up at the house?

01:35:46.759 --> 01:35:49.526
I didn't have a chance
to get up there today

01:35:49.528 --> 01:35:51.428
but the house is looking good.

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:53.263
Things be, they'll take
it down on Wednesday.

01:35:53.265 --> 01:35:54.099
K.

01:35:54.967 --> 01:35:56.368
That sounds good.

01:36:15.721 --> 01:36:17.990
Thank you for that, work.

01:36:19.825 --> 01:36:21.491
Appreciate it.

01:36:21.493 --> 01:36:22.995
Yep, no problem.

01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:27.330
If you need something
else just let me know.

01:36:27.332 --> 01:36:29.568
There's always something.

01:36:32.872 --> 01:36:33.706
Yep.

01:39:03.122 --> 01:39:06.358
Yeah we're
all set back here.

01:40:21.867 --> 01:40:22.701
Come in.

01:40:24.369 --> 01:40:25.768
There she is.

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:26.970
Lovely to see you.

01:40:26.972 --> 01:40:28.438
Are you here to collect Alex?

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.772
If I can pry him away.

01:40:29.774 --> 01:40:30.707
Good how are you.

01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:33.310
Let me take this little guy.

01:40:33.312 --> 01:40:36.081
Let me get your
jacket for you.

01:40:37.349 --> 01:40:38.882
How you doing?

01:40:38.884 --> 01:40:40.886
Pretty good.

01:40:42.487 --> 01:40:43.954
Where you putting these?

01:40:43.956 --> 01:40:45.488
Oh, I'll grab that.

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:47.157
Here can you take him for a sec.

01:40:47.159 --> 01:40:47.993
Sure.

01:40:49.294 --> 01:40:52.362
Well come on in,
have something to eat.

01:40:52.364 --> 01:40:56.001
Lots to drink in there
too, help yourself.

01:41:01.907 --> 01:41:02.874
Careful man.

01:42:06.338 --> 01:42:08.371
Now I understand
there has already been

01:42:08.373 --> 01:42:10.640
a private settlement
reached between the parties

01:42:10.642 --> 01:42:12.942
representing Mr.
and Ms. Ridlowe,

01:42:12.944 --> 01:42:14.877
and the Prince George Warriors?

01:42:14.879 --> 01:42:18.015
Yes,
that is correct sir.

01:42:18.017 --> 01:42:21.751
Alright, so that
leaves us with the matter

01:42:21.753 --> 01:42:25.522
of Mr. Burr, and the
liability of his part

01:42:25.524 --> 01:42:28.958
regarding his actions with
relation to the adverse impact

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.228
that those have had on
the respective parties

01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:33.596
represented here today.

01:42:33.598 --> 01:42:35.298
I would like to
remind all parties

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:38.668
that this is simply a
preliminary hearing,

01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:41.071
however you are welcome
to submit statements

01:42:41.073 --> 01:42:44.107
at this time should
you choose to.

01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:47.844
Mr. Howard, I understand
that you would like to do so.

01:42:47.846 --> 01:42:50.547
Yes, your Honor.

01:42:50.549 --> 01:42:53.483
We feel that it is
imperative in this situation

01:42:53.485 --> 01:42:56.686
to recognize the responsibility
of the individual.

01:42:56.688 --> 01:42:58.655
And that the
individual's actions,

01:42:58.657 --> 01:43:02.159

01:43:02.161 --> 01:43:06.298
endorsement, or support of
the Prince George Warriors.

01:43:07.632 --> 01:43:09.866
We feel that this is
specifically vital in context

01:43:09.868 --> 01:43:12.469
of the character

01:43:12.471 --> 01:43:15.372
In this case we have
a young man who,

01:43:15.374 --> 01:43:17.774
since the incident on
which we are focused,

01:43:17.776 --> 01:43:20.210
has been held in police custody.

01:43:20.212 --> 01:43:24.383
What this would seem to indicate
is a pattern of violence.
