FOR THAT.

IT'S ANONYMOUS.

23:04.117 --> 23:05.266

HE WAS A COURIER.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.927
THAT WAS IT.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.578
I NEVER GAVE THE GUY
A SECOND THOUGHT.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.281

HEY! YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:04.035 --> 40:05.101
YEAH.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.409
HE REALLY LOVED HIS SON.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.112
I MEAN, HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

40:16.114 --> 40:19.716
YEAH, BUT BRINGING A CHILD
INTO THAT WORLD...

40:19.718 --> 40:21.151
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

40:21.153 --> 40:23.186
SIMPLE AS THAT?

40:23.188 --> 40:25.088
ISN'T IT?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.791
(SIGHS) YEAH,
I SUPPOSE.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.564
THEN WHAT'S THE MATTER?

40:38.937 --> 40:39.903
IT'S OUR WORLD TOO.

40:44.209 --> 40:48.478
¶ La, la, la, la... ¶

40:49.214 --> 40:53.082
¶ La, la, la... ¶

40:54.019 --> 40:56.586
¶ La, la, la... ¶

40:58.490 --> 41:01.224
¶ La, la, la ¶
