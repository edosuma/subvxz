00:37.352 --> 00:40.380
it seems like only yesterday the party would go on forever

00:40.610 --> 00:42.329
but in just 12 short months,

00:42.379 --> 00:45.467
the place known as americas spring break capital

00:45.557 --> 00:47.926
has become a virtual ghost town

00:49.075 --> 00:53.523
who can forget the devastating attack
on lake Victoria, that left scores

00:53.525 --> 00:56.251
of people dead, and a community in shock

00:56.361 --> 00:59.359
and who could have guessed that
this hell on earth would be rocked

00:59.449 --> 01:04.686
by a species of piranha believed
extinct for the last 2 million years

01:05.056 --> 01:08.424
a massi'veeradication program has left these waters

01:08.594 --> 01:10.003
teeming with life

01:10.053 --> 01:11.572
silent and dead

01:12.482 --> 01:15.890
after a massi'veexous that left most property abandoned

01:15.970 --> 01:17.999
the local econemy fell into ruin

01:18.918 --> 01:22.146
lake Victoria is now a quarantine area

01:22.546 --> 01:27.173
only weeds grow on the beaches where
thousands once soaked up the sun

01:27.233 --> 01:31.551
and the only boats that remain, are
dusty relics littering the shoreline

01:32.470 --> 01:35.639
as we look back on the anniversary of this tragic event

01:35.759 --> 01:37.867
were left to wonder, if it happened here

01:38.217 --> 01:39.846
can it happen again.

01:39.956 --> 01:41.755
And if so,

01:41.815 --> 01:42.963
where?

22:13.704 --> 22:16.242
she stole one of my ex boyfriends, and

22:18.721 --> 22:20.020
I'm pretty sure she stole

22:20.120 --> 22:22.918
a pair of ear rings my grandmother gave me before she died

22:23.178 --> 22:24.937
but... we were like sisters

22:32.083 --> 22:33.532

22:35.491 --> 22:36.790
Oh my God

23:44.492 --> 23:44.962

23:45.221 --> 23:45.891
lets go

23:54.326 --> 23:56.705
I've got you

24:36.772 --> 24:37.602
what is this thing

24:38.011 --> 24:38.891
Maddie...

24:39.880 --> 24:41.999
What the fuck is that?

24:57.630 --> 24:59.139
Oh shit

25:04.207 --> 25:05.816
is that a fucking piranha?

25:06.225 --> 25:11.003
My father worked construction on Carson dam

25:11.113 --> 25:13.211
they found fossils like this

25:13.311 --> 25:17.929
when they first broke ground
he gave me this on my 8th birthday

25:18.129 --> 25:22.276
I'm telling you man, it was a piranha
howd it get from lake Victoria to our lake?

25:22.376 --> 25:24.035
Thats what weve got to find out

25:31.121 --> 25:32.370
what? Look at us

25:33.250 --> 25:35.369
the cop and the marine biologist

25:36.088 --> 25:38.627
I'm sorry, it just sounds like a shitty sitcom

25:38.737 --> 25:40.756
the cop and the marine biologist

25:46.962 --> 25:48.771
your still wet

25:50.590 --> 25:52.139
a little yeah

26:29.198 --> 26:30.957
will you ask coony to open the door

26:31.327 --> 26:33.706
Kyle, open the door

26:34.165 --> 26:35.594
yoh man

26:37.074 --> 26:38.773
thats funny, dick

26:47.058 --> 26:48.197
who are you?

26:48.607 --> 26:49.846
Why are you here?

26:49.856 --> 26:51.705
Im sorry, we saw you on YouTube...

26:51.855 --> 26:55.033
You and 11 million 486 other people

26:55.543 --> 27:00.670
I have 700 more hits than the laughing diarrhea baby

27:00.930 --> 27:03.878
we need your expertees mr Goodman

27:06.207 --> 27:07.556
why?

27:08.536 --> 27:10.045
We think there back...

27:16.871 --> 27:19.000
False lake isnt even connected

27:19.260 --> 27:20.599
to lake Victoria

27:20.959 --> 27:25.676
the piranha must be migrating through
underground lakes and rivers

27:26.136 --> 27:28.884
I'vestudied this specimen for

27:29.034 --> 27:30.333
almost a year

27:40.168 --> 27:42.856
I think you might find this interesting

27:43.946 --> 27:45.705
can I get some help here

27:47.204 --> 27:48.143
ok

27:48.343 --> 27:50.312
this is galvanised steel

27:50.472 --> 27:55.579
like ordinary household plumbing

27:55.959 --> 27:57.718
there we go

27:57.868 --> 28:00.046
aha, now for some incentive

28:03.464 --> 28:07.602
no no no, not the frog

28:07.652 --> 28:09.521
sorry they sold out of
puppys this morning

28:12.669 --> 28:18.016
now, I think this is
quite resourceful, watch

28:42.432 --> 28:44.971
now its got something to grab

28:51.187 --> 28:54.285
its a frog

28:55.845 --> 28:57.034
Barry, are you crazy?

28:57.444 --> 28:58.693
You almost lost a hand

28:58.743 --> 29:00.292
I had a pet frog once

29:02.571 --> 29:03.560
uhh

29:03.660 --> 29:05.059
can you gi'veme...?

29:05.159 --> 29:10.086
Really?-Now to check on some data.
What were you thinking?

29:18.981 --> 29:21.000
These piranha spent eons

29:21.050 --> 29:25.658
living in underground lakes

29:25.758 --> 29:29.026
full of sulphur dioxide

29:29.126 --> 29:33.373
from all the geo thermal activity

29:33.423 --> 29:34.463
thats how they come back to spawn

29:34.772 --> 29:35.962
they followed the wrong lake somehow?
Yes

29:38.650 --> 29:41.708
problem is sulphur dioxide

29:41.858 --> 29:45.326
is probably released during the
treatment of chlorinated water

29:45.336 --> 29:48.335
so its conceivable

29:48.535 --> 29:55.421
that the fish could become confused
and try to enter man made drainage systems

29:57.090 --> 30:05.090
especially with an abundance of backyard pools

30:05.725 --> 30:10.072
our waterpark drains directly into false lake.
Thats the equivalent of like a thousand swimming pools

30:10.282 --> 30:13.280
that would be a very bad thing

30:13.281 --> 30:15.559
did you tell anyone that this could happen?

30:15.659 --> 30:20.816
I tried, unfortunately I lost some
credibility after my last book

30:20.916 --> 30:24.714
that foretold plague of dreadful walking fish

30:24.824 --> 30:26.633
oh thats right

30:26.733 --> 30:30.990
you wrote the fish walk among us
I love that book

30:31.110 --> 30:33.359
its really great why thank you

30:34.189 --> 30:36.108
kindred spirit

30:44.803 --> 30:46.512
thanks

30:47.651 --> 30:49.100
Barry.

30:50.130 --> 30:53.548
You ah...
you read a marine biology book?

30:53.707 --> 30:55.466
I wanted to see what you were so interested in

31:00.224 --> 31:03.952
look guys, we have to check the drains
and the outflow pipe into the lake tonight

31:04.162 --> 31:07.060
I can get a di'veteam up here from tempy by tomorrow

31:07.160 --> 31:10.888
no its too late, the waterpark opens
tomorrow, that place is going to be packed

31:11.567 --> 31:13.586
if the fish are gettign through the drain system

31:13.686 --> 31:17.364
that would make lake Victoria look like an appetizer

31:17.984 --> 31:20.152
guys weve got to get out there right now

31:20.882 --> 31:23.210
thank you so much for your help mr Goodman.

31:23.211 --> 31:24.400
Oh thank you

31:24.610 --> 31:25.749
thank you sir, an honour

31:26.059 --> 31:27.458
be well, alright

31:31.646 --> 31:35.064
aha... 11 million 888 hits

31:35.324 --> 31:41.270
take that laughing diarrhea baby

32:07.056 --> 32:10.724
2 local teens, Ashley sorby and Travis Mitchell

32:10.784 --> 32:13.992
were reported missing this morning after
there van was pulled out of cross lake

32:14.711 --> 32:16.320
thanks for letting me stay here

32:16.680 --> 32:18.389
its totally cool

32:19.109 --> 32:20.818
how you feeling?

32:21.448 --> 32:22.117
A little better

32:22.217 --> 32:23.716
you don't seem any better

32:24.446 --> 32:26.365
hey what is it?

32:26.465 --> 32:29.413
Just the stress of the whole Ashley thing

32:34.280 --> 32:36.509

Right now?

32:41.116 --> 32:43.595
Please Josh

32:44.844 --> 32:47.223
I think something is really wrong with me

32:48.252 --> 32:51.830
if I don't get better, I don't want to die a virgin

32:55.348 --> 32:58.556

33:05.962 --> 33:09.320

33:11.499 --> 33:15.017
the outflow pipe leads directly to the
waterpark, I'vegot to check them out

33:15.067 --> 33:16.826
you considered how bat shit crazy this is right?

33:17.815 --> 33:19.834
I got to take a look, ill be quick

33:20.454 --> 33:23.712

What about all the beach partys in high school

33:40.692 --> 33:42.601

33:42.811 --> 33:46.018
Oh my God Barry, I totally would

33:46.019 --> 33:48.868
yeah I know, you seemed kind of busy at the time

33:50.007 --> 33:51.246

39:43.387 --> 39:46.284
