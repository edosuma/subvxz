00:05.730 --> 00:07.552
- Hey, guys.
- Mitch!

00:07.603 --> 00:10.606
I thought I heard a matchbox car pull up.

00:11.517 --> 00:15.382
Yeah, I'm short, and you're shaped like a lollipop.
I'm not in the mood, Forman.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.632
My brother Jack's wedding is tomorrow,
and I don't have a date.

00:18.699 --> 00:22.301
Oh, did you try Aly Richards?
She'll go anywhere there's cake.

00:22.942 --> 00:25.338
That's how I got her
into my car.

00:26.435 --> 00:28.713
But then I ate the cake,
and she left.

00:29.626 --> 00:31.440
Oh, I'm in a real bind here.

00:31.494 --> 00:35.166
I showed up at the engagement party alone.
My family made so much fun of me.

00:35.213 --> 00:38.788
So I said to myself,
'cause, of course, I was alone,

00:39.559 --> 00:42.894
that I would bring someone sizzling hot
with me to the wedding.

00:43.129 --> 00:45.291
Hey, Donna,
would you be my date?

00:45.894 --> 00:48.106
Mitch, I don't know
what to say.

00:48.157 --> 00:50.922
Oh, let me help you out.
"NO!"

00:52.833 --> 00:56.829
Donna, if you went with me, I might finally earn
some respect from my family.

00:56.879 --> 00:59.074
Let me say this for you
one more time in spanish.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.901
NO!

01:02.198 --> 01:03.958
I taught him that.

01:05.069 --> 01:05.991
Eric,

01:06.579 --> 01:07.987
it seems harmless.

01:08.020 --> 01:10.115
No, Donna, I'm sorry, but

01:10.651 --> 01:12.277
I forbid it.

01:12.411 --> 01:13.551
Oh.

01:13.819 --> 01:15.870
Mitch, I'd love to go.

01:16.306 --> 01:17.680
- Donna, what the hell?
- No,

01:17.731 --> 01:20.355
I forbid you to ask me
questions about this.

01:20.674 --> 01:24.009
- But, Donna...
- Let me tell you one more time in spanish...

01:25.759 --> 01:29.037
Oh, hey, Donna, thanks so much
for doing this.

01:29.121 --> 01:31.417
Sure, but, you know, just friends.

01:31.501 --> 01:34.250
You don't get to touch
any of this juicy stuff.

01:35.173 --> 01:38.799
No, don't worry. I'll even ask another couple
to be, like, chaperones.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.480
Hey, Jackie,
do you and Hyde want to go?

01:41.530 --> 01:44.621
Oh, I'm in.
But I can't ask Steven.

01:44.671 --> 01:48.197
I'm still on probation for tricking him
into a ballroom dancing class.

01:48.408 --> 01:52.940
I'll go with you, Jackie, but I warn you...
don't drink too much.

01:53.845 --> 01:56.325
I will take advantage.

01:59.433 --> 02:02.828

02:38.572 --> 02:39.750
Wow.

02:39.953 --> 02:44.049
I can't believe you finally sprung for cable tv.
Wasn't it you who said,

02:44.142 --> 02:48.249
"I'd rather kiss Ho Chi Minh
than pay for tv"?

02:49.459 --> 02:53.488
Well, your mother and i are running out
of things to talk about, so

02:53.989 --> 02:58.189
I thought the extra 20 channels
might help fill in the gaps.

02:58.572 --> 03:02.484
Ohh. Wait a second. Cable guy left?
 He forgot to hook up the basement.

03:02.563 --> 03:07.250
No, he didn't so much forget as follow my
"don't hook up the basement" instructions.

03:07.669 --> 03:13.902
But, Red, for an extra 2 bucks a month, your wife
and children could be enjoying full-frontal nudity.

03:14.868 --> 03:17.880
But I don't want you
to enjoy anything.

03:18.875 --> 03:22.567
I want people your age
out of my house.

03:23.127 --> 03:25.589
Hey, I'm only here
'cause you had a heart attack.

03:25.641 --> 03:28.653
I only had a heart attack
because you're here.

03:33.848 --> 03:36.823
I'm sorry, Michael, but I'm gonna have
to search that bag.

03:36.912 --> 03:41.757
Every time you leave my house with a backpack,
I have to buy new hair spray.

03:42.412 --> 03:44.821
I didn't take anything.
This is lunch.

03:44.899 --> 03:46.890
I planned a whole romantic day
for me and Brooke.

03:46.942 --> 03:48.838
So where are you
and Brooke headed?

03:48.917 --> 03:53.787
Well, since she's having a baby, I thought
I'd take her to a place that kids and girls like,

03:53.866 --> 04:00.458
so I figured I'd start the date off at an amusement park
and we'd go on a ride on the "lightning whip".

04:01.969 --> 04:06.814
I'm gonna take her horseback riding
up to this overlook, and then we're gonna get cozy

04:06.880 --> 04:11.070
and drink a little Bingo-Bango.

04:11.635 --> 04:15.476
Oh, sweetie, you're so wrong,
it makes me want to cry a little.

04:15.571 --> 04:22.769
Pregnant women can't go on roller coasters, and they definitely
can't drink alcohol, or bad things can happen to the baby.

04:22.835 --> 04:25.028
Case in point.. Eric.

04:25.650 --> 04:29.447
Well, we didn't know any better back then.

04:29.709 --> 04:34.928
I'm teaching a baby-care class at the hospital.
If you brought Brooke, I think she'd be very impressed.

04:35.026 --> 04:37.481
All right. Yeah, sign us up.

04:37.579 --> 04:42.555
You know, there was a time that all I had to do
to impress a girl was turn my eyelids inside out.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.485
This baby's changing everything. Oh.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.445
Thanks again for doing this, Donna.

05:00.543 --> 05:04.894
Grandpa saw me walk in with you,
and he slipped me a 20.

05:05.336 --> 05:06.678
Here, you should have this.

05:06.776 --> 05:09.689
See, that kind of makes me a hooker.

05:14.796 --> 05:17.022
Well, hello.

05:17.087 --> 05:20.786
Looks like we're sharing a table here.

05:21.147 --> 05:26.253
Here's your drink, here's your bread,
and here's your new lover.

05:27.862 --> 05:29.630
You wish.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.525
I'm sitting next to a goddess.

05:34.311 --> 05:37.781
I know. Didn't my hair come out great tonight?

05:38.010 --> 05:40.367
Not you, shorty. Her.

05:40.956 --> 05:42.364
I need your help.

05:42.495 --> 05:45.605
Oh, this is so easy, Fez.
She's like me.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.892
She's a country club girl, and we're bitches.

05:49.711 --> 05:53.508
We only understand one thing.. money.

05:54.162 --> 05:56.487
- How much should I give her?
- No.

05:57.450 --> 06:00.461
Fez, act rich.

06:00.723 --> 06:03.473
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Eric.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.961
Eric, what are you doing here?

06:06.059 --> 06:11.787
I changed my work schedule so I could make sure
that Mitch keeps his tiny little doll hands to himself.

06:12.508 --> 06:14.537
Eric, mitch is not a threat to you.

06:14.657 --> 06:19.250
Okay, he's a perfectly harmless guy
who happens to worship the ground I walk on.

06:19.431 --> 06:22.390
You know, it's not his fault that I'm eye candy.

06:24.066 --> 06:27.182
Well, relax. Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

06:28.356 --> 06:32.994
Welcome to the holiday hotel ballroom.
I'll be your waiter this evening,

06:33.162 --> 06:39.028
but unlike a normal waiter,
I despise and may try to destroy you.

06:39.887 --> 06:41.144
Waiter,

06:41.319 --> 06:43.279
I'm rich.

06:45.392 --> 06:48.950
And as a rich man,
I have much more money than you.

06:50.164 --> 06:52.364
Fez, I'm really not in the mood.

06:52.495 --> 06:58.387
Sometimes I'm not in the mood to count all my money,
but I do it anyway because I am a fat cat.

06:58.736 --> 07:02.681
Yeah, well, your bow tie is starting
to unclip, fat cat.

07:04.122 --> 07:08.806
Unbelievable. They come to this country.
We give them a job...

07:11.106 --> 07:13.306
they're just so ungrateful.

07:14.274 --> 07:17.207
I'm christy. And you are?

07:17.967 --> 07:19.564
Ferrari.

07:21.502 --> 07:23.492
Fez Ferrari.

07:30.129 --> 07:35.157
<i>hahaha.. oh, this charity car wash
was a great idea, girls.</i>

07:35.210 --> 07:37.959
<i>Let's take our shirts off!</i>

07:39.411 --> 07:42.160
Who changed my channel?

07:43.941 --> 07:45.381
What the...

07:52.792 --> 07:54.835
Steven!

07:57.988 --> 08:00.554
What the hell's the matter with you?

08:00.920 --> 08:03.042
Stealing my cable!

08:03.120 --> 08:05.294
Red, before you blow your stack,

08:05.372 --> 08:08.512
why don't you take a look at that
car wash girl?

08:10.005 --> 08:12.754
She is so sudsy.

08:14.116 --> 08:19.065
You drilled a hole in my floor.

08:20.689 --> 08:25.508
My foot is about to drill a hole in your ass!

08:26.565 --> 08:31.227
But, Red, the car wash girls have to make $500

08:31.698 --> 08:35.940
or their super-freaky love nest
is gonna be turned into a bookstore.

08:36.611 --> 08:40.116
Look, there's only one clicker,
and that's upstairs.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.577
My cable, my channel.

08:48.448 --> 08:53.722
<i>stop spraying me, silly, or I'm gonna have
to come over there and kiss you.</i>

08:53.801 --> 08:58.567
<i>Tasha, you want a kiss, too?
Wow, Tasha, you have the biggest..</i>

08:58.619 --> 09:01.352
<i>...thunderstorms, which will result
in a small-craft advisory on lake superior.</i>

09:01.352 --> 09:03.357
No, no!

09:08.083 --> 09:11.690
Man, look at all these preggos.

09:13.032 --> 09:15.766
God, that one's walking like a gigantic duck.

09:15.845 --> 09:20.139
She's definitely in her third trimester.
The baby probably dropped.

09:20.401 --> 09:22.679
Nah, I think it's still in there.

09:23.465 --> 09:26.660
It means the baby's gotten itself
into the birthing position.

09:26.712 --> 09:28.817
Oh. Man, you really know stuff.

09:28.896 --> 09:31.279
Well, I've read every baby book in the library.

09:31.331 --> 09:34.291
By the way, did you ever read
that book I gave you by Dr. Spock?

09:34.370 --> 09:38.219
No, I kind a lost interest when I realized
it wasn't about "Star Trek."

09:38.638 --> 09:42.278
Well, you signed us up for this class,
and that was very thoughtful.

09:42.357 --> 09:45.761
Well, that's me. I'm Mr. Thoughtful.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.898
Man, how many kids are you having?

09:50.181 --> 09:54.318
Oh, hi, Michael. Hope you're ready
to talk boo-boos, burps and binkies.

09:54.397 --> 09:58.875
Yeah, uh, Brooke, this is Mrs. Forman, the lady that told me
I shouldn't take you horseback riding.

09:58.954 --> 10:03.196
And, mrs. Forman, this is Brooke,
the hot librarian I impregnated.

10:03.726 --> 10:06.004
Well, I am so happy you two are here.

10:06.083 --> 10:09.775
And you should be happy, because you have
me as your tour guide as

10:09.906 --> 10:16.060
you make the transition
to parenthood.

10:18.260 --> 10:19.685
Michael.

10:20.182 --> 10:23.586
But that could have been anybody.
Everybody knows I rule.

10:24.372 --> 10:27.619
Okay, all right, okay.
Let's get started.

10:27.907 --> 10:36.062
Now, when you first bring your little bundles of joy home,
they will spend almost 20 hours a day sleeping and pooping.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.261
Man, that's the life, huh?

10:39.994 --> 10:45.099
Now who can tell me what they will do
with the rest of their cute, little time?

10:45.211 --> 10:47.280
- Ooh. Yes, Brooke.
- They'll be eating.

10:47.358 --> 10:50.370
Very good.
And what will they be eating?

10:50.448 --> 10:54.141
Hey, when you're not looking,
I'm gonna sneak the little guy some popcorn.

10:54.242 --> 10:57.800
Michael, babies can't eat popcorn.
They don't even have teeth.

10:57.922 --> 11:03.019
My grandma bessie doesn't have any teeth,
and trust me, she ain't shy around a bucket of popcorn.

11:08.135 --> 11:14.080
Well, Christy says money's great, but she wants
to get to know the real me. And,

11:14.263 --> 11:19.624
And, um, I really care about her.
So what's another fake, good quality

11:19.785 --> 11:23.278
I could pretend to have
to trick her into the sack?

11:24.817 --> 11:30.219
Okay, um, okay, well, she's wearing fur,
which means she must love animals,

11:30.418 --> 11:34.058
which means she must like sensitive guys.

11:34.416 --> 11:36.548
Sensitive, huh?

11:36.626 --> 11:38.433
Mm-hmm. Oh, you're good.

11:38.957 --> 11:40.764
Hey, cutie. Where you been?

11:40.816 --> 11:44.587
Who the hell do you think you are,
talking to me like that? I'm sensitive.

11:46.996 --> 11:50.892
Fez! I..I guess it's a tradition for
the best man to say a few words.

11:50.997 --> 11:54.558
And all I really want to say
is that my brother

11:54.637 --> 11:59.665
is not the only one fortunate enough
to find himself in love's warm embrace.

12:00.069 --> 12:05.044
So, everybody, I'd like to introduce you
to Donna.. my new fiancée.

12:06.458 --> 12:12.020
Or as I like to call her, my big,
red love machine. That's her.

12:21.179 --> 12:23.143
Mitch, what the hell are you doing?

12:23.232 --> 12:25.929
Ooh, look at that fireball go.

12:26.532 --> 12:29.648
Feisty at the table, feisty in the bedroom.

12:29.831 --> 12:35.514
No. No. She's feisty in my bedroom, people.
My bedroom.

12:35.750 --> 12:40.505
Okay, he's just some lying, crazy lunatic.
He's crazy. This guy's crazy.

12:43.647 --> 12:45.035
And, uh,

12:45.480 --> 12:48.309
my congratulations to the happy couple.

12:50.351 --> 12:53.478
This is the best wedding
I have ever been to.

12:54.473 --> 12:58.479
<i>...barometric pressure
from a cold front out of Canada.</i>

12:59.187 --> 13:02.277
Look at all that hail in Buffalo.

13:03.770 --> 13:06.486
How can you watch this?

13:06.686 --> 13:11.164
It comforts me to know that there are people
out there more miserable than me,

13:11.793 --> 13:15.721
like those people in Buffalo...
and you.

13:17.764 --> 13:21.252
You have to sit here?
Why don't you go read a book?

13:21.729 --> 13:23.928
Why don't you go read a book?

13:24.609 --> 13:27.673
Because... I have cable.

13:30.737 --> 13:33.015
Very nice.

13:33.131 --> 13:39.498
Baby says, "It's tight, but not too tight,
and I wuv the way you powdered my wittle bottom."

13:40.699 --> 13:44.129
I never thought I'd say this,
but you gotta take it easy on the 'nads.

13:44.286 --> 13:48.782
I know what I'm doing. It's just,
it sounded so much easier in the books.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.582
Okay, there.

13:50.661 --> 13:52.991
Ooh, let's have a look. Uh-oh.

13:53.070 --> 13:57.260
Baby says,
"That's too loose. Now I'm gonna wee-wee on daddy."

13:58.229 --> 14:02.325
I just have to redo the safety pin.
God, why can't I do this?

14:02.377 --> 14:08.426
Oh, no. Baby says,
"Ouch, you poked me. "Now I'm gonna cry. Wah! Wah!"

14:08.741 --> 14:10.207
That's it. I give up.

14:10.286 --> 14:16.503
"Oh, mommy, don't leave me. I don't want to end up
in state-run foster care. Wah! Wah!"

14:18.807 --> 14:23.547
You know, you seem normal around your family,
but out in the world, you're a little nuts.

14:27.747 --> 14:29.869
So it turns out

14:30.000 --> 14:32.147
I was right about Mitch.

14:32.985 --> 14:37.358
So let's see, that's you, wrong.

14:37.463 --> 14:39.479
Me,

14:39.741 --> 14:41.375
right.

14:41.558 --> 14:42.868
All right, you don't have to rub it in.

14:42.920 --> 14:48.550
Uh, I think I do, Donna...
So rub-a-dub-dub, I'm right.

14:50.907 --> 14:53.107
I am humiliated!

14:53.709 --> 14:58.186
The only way I'm gonna get my pride
back is to kick your ass!

14:58.302 --> 15:00.581
So I'm challenging you to a fight.

15:00.764 --> 15:04.037
That is, unless you're too chicken.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.996
What is this, third grade?

15:07.075 --> 15:15.560
Okay, here's what I just heard.
ba-gawk, ooh, third grade, ooh.

15:17.053 --> 15:18.706
Okay, you can stop doing that.

15:18.758 --> 15:22.162
- Bawk, I can stop doing that, bawk.
- Okay, fine. You know what? I'll fight you. Fine.

15:22.241 --> 15:26.876
Good. Tomorrow! 5:15, the playground.
You be there!

15:28.335 --> 15:30.403
Um, why not just do it at 5?

15:30.456 --> 15:32.996
I have swimming lessons!

15:40.512 --> 15:42.947
Thank you so much for helping me
with Christy.

15:42.999 --> 15:45.854
She was telling me what she did
last summer at camp,

15:46.519 --> 15:49.137
and I think she might be a whore.

15:51.206 --> 15:55.082
- So if there's anything I can do for you..
- Actually, Fez, there is.

15:55.160 --> 15:59.989
When the bride tosses the bouquet, I really want to catch it.
It's such a sweet and magical moment,

16:00.041 --> 16:03.027
so I need you to knock
some of those fat sluts out of my way.

16:04.205 --> 16:06.771
I will make those weebles wobble.

16:08.028 --> 16:10.464
And they will fall down.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.742
Fez Ferrari,

16:14.702 --> 16:17.073
you're so rich and sensitive,

16:17.216 --> 16:19.873
I think I might go all the way with you.

16:20.594 --> 16:24.444
But only if you get everyone out of my way
so I can catch the bouquet.

16:25.895 --> 16:28.330
How many bouquets do they throw?

16:29.221 --> 16:30.556
One.

16:31.813 --> 16:33.332
Aye.

16:36.448 --> 16:38.812
let's see, who do I help?

16:38.864 --> 16:41.981
Old friend, new whore?

16:42.138 --> 16:45.018
Old friend, new whore?

17:00.725 --> 17:05.175
Oh, what am I saying?
Do the right thing, Fez.

17:22.357 --> 17:28.684
Okay, I don't know who gave you a tattoo,
but that is not good parenting.

17:28.831 --> 17:31.351
Look, Michael, I don't want to talk about it.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.723
I thought I was ready, but today
I found out I don't know how to use a diaper.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.309
We are gonna be covered in poo.

17:37.676 --> 17:44.983
Look, I think you're underestimating us, all right?
Especially me. These beautiful hands aren't just made for foreplay.

17:45.114 --> 17:46.899
Check it out.

17:47.340 --> 17:50.744
I remember the first time I baby sat
for my little brother

17:50.842 --> 17:53.756
and he power-dooked all over himself, right?

17:54.050 --> 17:57.370
So I got my mom's salad tongs
and pulled off his pants,

17:57.468 --> 18:01.429
and then I grabbed him by the ankles
and took him outside and hosed him off.

18:01.724 --> 18:03.657
And voilà.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.339
Oh, Michael, it's so perfect.

18:06.438 --> 18:11.446
See, you got the brains and the maternal instincts,
and I know how to wrap ass.

18:11.511 --> 18:14.897
We're gonna do this together,
and we're gonna be fine.

18:16.108 --> 18:20.396
"Ooh, daddy ,that's just how I like it."

18:22.262 --> 18:25.470
You're really starting to creep me out.

18:27.499 --> 18:33.176
<i>...winds variable out of the northeast,
20 miles an hour with gusts to 45.</i>

18:41.491 --> 18:44.535
Oh, weather kicks ass.

18:49.551 --> 18:51.123
Forman,

18:51.417 --> 18:55.869
I'm your bud, so I'm rooting
for you in this fight. But

18:55.967 --> 18:59.568
business is business,
so I got 50 bucks on the little guy.

18:59.830 --> 19:03.104
Well, I see the chicken
showed up for his beating.

19:03.169 --> 19:06.148
How can I be a chicken
if I showed up for the fight?

19:06.229 --> 19:14.052
You know, it's funny, 'cause what I just heard was...
chicken... bawk! Fight... bawk!

19:16.122 --> 19:19.486
Eric, as someone that has been...

19:19.615 --> 19:21.653
punched a lot,

19:22.105 --> 19:27.941
I have some advice. Do not move to a new country
and try to fit in at high school.

19:28.502 --> 19:32.823
Hey, Forman, come back here
so we can go over the rules.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.918
Okay, Eric, one last thing.

19:35.049 --> 19:41.400
You know when we're play-fighting and you grab my wrist
and I go, "ow! Ow! Ow!"? That doesn't really hurt.

19:42.276 --> 19:45.713
Okay? So... don't do that.

19:45.975 --> 19:49.248
What? The Forman death grip?

19:50.918 --> 19:53.405
Man, I was really counting on that.

19:54.256 --> 19:58.512
What are you doing here?
I don't want to fight you.

19:58.610 --> 20:02.094
I was just trying to act tough
so I can get my self-respect back.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.189
By threatening me?

20:04.614 --> 20:08.182
It's okay. It's okay. I've got a way out of this
that'll make us both look good.

20:08.281 --> 20:11.259
We'll tell everyone that
we worked it out like gentlemen,

20:11.325 --> 20:13.649
and now we're the best of friends.

20:13.991 --> 20:16.479
Well, no. Mitch, look,

20:16.544 --> 20:21.356
Donna was really nice to you, and you humiliated her.
I can't let you treat people like that.

20:21.618 --> 20:23.091
Today I'm...

20:23.746 --> 20:26.626
I'm standing up for all humanity.

20:26.986 --> 20:32.911
Would you do it for a 1968 G.I. Joe desert rat edition
with the original mess kit?

20:33.042 --> 20:37.179
Please. I have three of those.

20:37.997 --> 20:41.860
- The French version?
- G.I. Jacques.

20:43.006 --> 20:45.395
It does exist.

20:45.788 --> 20:47.739
We got a deal?

20:48.603 --> 20:53.481
Well, I'm afraid there's not
gonna be a fight here. Uh,

20:53.579 --> 20:56.790
guys, we worked out our differences, and

20:56.856 --> 21:02.453
basically, he's a really great guy.

21:03.468 --> 21:06.807
- He's doing the chicken thing behind me.
- Yeah.

21:06.905 --> 21:08.774
He's really good at it.

21:09.229 --> 21:12.241
That's not the only thing
I'm good at, cherry pie.

21:12.601 --> 21:14.500
All right, that's it. You're dead.

21:14.565 --> 21:18.781
Ooh! ooh! ohh!
Start the car, Mom! Start the car!

21:25.930 --> 21:27.670
<i>temperatures in the..</i>

21:27.769 --> 21:31.066
<i>ooh, Mr. Handyman. I'm so glad you're here.</i>

21:31.164 --> 21:34.613
<i>There's so many things I need you to nail.</i>

21:34.737 --> 21:37.727
<i>lucky for you I have a big hammer.</i>

21:39.071 --> 21:41.694
Red, you dirty man.

21:46.480 --> 21:51.167
Mrs. Forman. What are you watching?

21:51.167 --> 21:55.167
Weather.
