No, it was last week.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.909
But she didn't leave a will.

09:15.910 --> 09:18.208
It shouldn't be contentious,
there's only two of us.

09:18.210 --> 09:20.041
It's my brother and myself.

09:20.050 --> 09:22.598
And my mother had put
tack-on notes on everything

to make sure that
there wouldn't be

09:23.770 --> 09:26.284

09:26.290 --> 09:28.451
My mother doesn't have a
lot of valuable things,

09:28.460 --> 09:31.475
but she was a friend of Marc
Chagall's wife, Valentina,

09:31.480 --> 09:34.256

her a signed print.

No, three clients,

for my brother at his auto shop,

but it's not--

17:22.680 --> 17:24.500

depend on your job?

I'd work other jobs--

no answer, please.

17:32.490 --> 17:36.278
Assault and battery, with two
BFWs for failure to appear.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.078
He is a danger to the
public and a flight risk.

auto body shop that he works at.

Mr. Banner, your bail
is set at $500,000.

Excuse me, Your
Honor, that's too much.

You need $50,000
to get out of jail.

this box on their sheet.

to send the $135

19:06.010 --> 19:07.489

That's how you
don't get cheated.

send you any money.

Due to the loss
of tack-on notes,

Mr. Lee?

19:51.120 --> 19:52.849
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.613
But, given the fact that a heat
wave caused the notes to fall,

19:55.620 --> 19:58.976
and are now spread across the
floor of Mrs. Smulders' house,

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.287
Dr. Caine, did you
have an opportunity

20:21.290 --> 20:23.713
to examine the notes in
Mrs. Smulders' house?

20:23.720 --> 20:24.493
Yes, I did.

anything relevant to this case?

20:30.470 --> 20:31.164
Yes.

20:31.170 --> 20:33.855
Every adhesive retains
some trace of the surface

20:33.860 --> 20:35.532
it comes in contact with.

20:35.540 --> 20:38.202
We call that pressure
sensitive contact release.

And did you do a chemical
study of the adhesive

20:41.090 --> 20:43.331
on this specific note?

Yes, it had traces
of Dutch gold leaf

on its adhesive strip.

- Yes, Your Honor.

21:13.220 --> 21:14.949
But I do have a few questions.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.440
Dr. Caine, I see that
there are other chemicals

21:17.450 --> 21:19.816
on this note's adhesive.
What are they?

21:19.820 --> 21:23.927
House dust mites, various
lead compounds, human hair--

21:23.930 --> 21:26.114
From the carpet in the room?

21:26.120 --> 21:27.610
Yes, exactly.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.860
It's to be expected.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.634
I also see that one of the
desk lamps in Mrs. Smulders'

21:31.640 --> 21:33.733
house is made of lead.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.230
You see that one here?
DR. IAN CAINE: Yes.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.653
Is it possible that
the lead on the adhesive

21:38.660 --> 21:42.437
didn't come from the carpet,
but came from the lamp?

21:42.440 --> 21:43.725
Yes, it's possible.

21:43.730 --> 21:46.016
But it still had
gold leaf on it.

21:46.020 --> 21:48.682
That means that the note
came from the frame.

21:48.690 --> 21:51.830
But if Mrs. Smulders changed
her mind and moved the note--

21:51.840 --> 21:52.534

the lamp, would the note

Yes, it would.

Well, I pitched
to the partners

26:35.600 --> 26:37.545
a new way to bill the clients.

But the worry I have
is, Lockhart-Agos

the fall pattern of the notes

They flutter, but
they will never

27:12.350 --> 27:15.319
flutter more than 30 degrees
from the starting point.

27:15.330 --> 27:16.262
This is the falling cone.

So, if we were to look at
a photo of Mrs. Smulders'

be able to determine

27:21.800 --> 27:24.496

Yes.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.024
We need to listen
to new Ideas.

35:45.030 --> 35:45.724
And we did.

35:49.470 --> 35:53.031
This firm is becoming
a laughingstock.

35:53.040 --> 35:53.734
Where?

35:53.740 --> 35:56.880
We're seen as being
old and out of touch.

35:56.890 --> 35:59.927
The associates don't
think we listen to them.

35:59.930 --> 36:02.945
We need to change.

36:02.950 --> 36:05.839
The only question, sir,
is bail at this point.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.273
I don't need--

36:07.280 --> 36:08.690
Mrs. Florrick,
please approach.

36:11.930 --> 36:12.624
You have to stay.

36:12.630 --> 36:14.257
I don't have another
bar attorney.

36:14.260 --> 36:14.954
Step back.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.177
I'm sorry, Your
Honor, I can't.

36:16.180 --> 36:17.818
I have_ an inheritance
matter In probate court.

36:17.820 --> 36:19.617
I don't care. _
You're here, you're stayIng.

36:22.350 --> 36:23.886
Lucca, you need
to get here now.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.630
I need to get to
probate in 10 minutes.

36:25.640 --> 36:26.834
LUCCA QUINN (ON
PHONE): Where's Don?

36:26.840 --> 36:28.819
I don't know, but you
need to get here now.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.185
LUCCA QUINN (ON PHONE):
I'm too far away.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.305
Where's probate court?

36:41.830 --> 36:42.922
Who are you?

36:42.930 --> 36:43.828
I'm Lucca Quinn.

36:43.830 --> 36:45.741
Alicia asked me to step in
just to get a continuance.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.047
Where is she?

36:47.050 --> 36:48.790
OK, where are we?

36:48.800 --> 36:51.382
Are we going to hear from
a scissors expert today?

36:51.390 --> 36:54.325
Your Honor, we actually have
at our table Mrs. Smulders'

36:54.330 --> 36:55.900
housekeeper, Selena Abarca.

36:55.910 --> 36:57.719
They must have
made a deal with her.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.324
Your Honor, I'm Lucca Quinn.

36:59.330 --> 37:00.957
I'm acting on behalf
of Mrs. Florrick

37:00.960 --> 37:02.006
to ask for a continuance.

37:02.010 --> 37:04.103
Your Honor, this
is a stalling tactic.

37:04.110 --> 37:05.759
Mrs. Florrick is
not stalling, she's

37:05.760 --> 37:07.045
been held up at the bond court.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.039
Really?

37:08.040 --> 37:10.463
She finds the bond court
more Important than us?

37:10.470 --> 37:11.744
Not important, Your Honor.

37:11.750 --> 37:13.172
She's-- the judge is
not allowing her to--

37:13.180 --> 37:14.545
What does this
housekeeper have to say?

37:14.550 --> 37:16.256
It's actually
what our expert has

37:16.260 --> 37:18.683
to say about her tack-on note.
- Expert.

37:18.690 --> 37:20.749
You know, I thought we were
going to get by at least

37:20.760 --> 37:22.910
10 minutes without an expert.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.343
Your Honor, I must again
ask for a continuance.

37:25.350 --> 37:27.932
I'm not privy to all of Mrs.
Florrick's thinking on this.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.089
Oh, that's too bad.

37:29.090 --> 37:29.784
Sit back down.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.178
Do you know
anything about this?

37:35.180 --> 37:38.354
In examining this new
pressure sensitive adhesive,

37:38.360 --> 37:40.669
I found more Dutch gold leaf.

37:40.670 --> 37:42.251
DIANE LOCKHART: The
same imitation gold

37:42.260 --> 37:43.693
leaf from the Chagall frame?

37:43.700 --> 37:44.928
That is correct.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.249
And there was nothing else.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.787
No lead from the
lamp or the rug?

37:48.790 --> 37:49.484
DR. IAN CAINE: N0.

37:49.490 --> 37:52.243
Meaning Ms. Abarca's
note had to fall

37:52.250 --> 37:53.171
from the Chagall painting?

37:53.180 --> 37:54.169
DR. IAN CAINE: That's correct.

37:54.180 --> 37:55.044
You should have checked.

37:55.050 --> 37:57.678
Objection, Your Honor.

37:57.680 --> 37:58.578
Relevance?

37:58.580 --> 38:00.309
Good guess, no.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.198
Your Honor, we believe that
the Chagall painting was left

38:03.200 --> 38:05.805
to Mrs. Smulders'
housekeeper, Selena Abarca,

38:05.810 --> 38:07.300
and we ask that your honor rule.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.585
Does counselor have anything?

38:09.590 --> 38:11.831
Again, we ask for a
continuance, Your Honor.

38:11.840 --> 38:15.071
Ms. Lockhart has made
a very strong argument.

38:15.080 --> 38:18.379
I am prone to reward this
housekeeper the inheritance,

38:18.380 --> 38:20.826
unless there's anything more.
- Your Honor?

38:20.830 --> 38:22.513
Counselor, I
have already ruled.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.294
There is not going
to be a continuance.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.746
I understand, I just
wanted to be clear.

38:26.750 --> 38:29.685
That lady is a housekeeper
to the deceased?

38:29.690 --> 38:30.588
Yes, why?

38:30.590 --> 38:32.148
And this is about
an inheritance?

38:32.150 --> 38:32.923
Yes, it is.

38:32.930 --> 38:33.942
You catch on quickly.

38:33.950 --> 38:35.793
And was the
deceased an invalid?

38:35.800 --> 38:37.051
She was in a wheelchair.

38:37.060 --> 38:37.924
Why?

38:37.930 --> 38:40.546
And I'm guessing this
asset, this painting,

38:40.550 --> 38:42.324
was worth more than $20,000?

38:42.330 --> 38:43.797
Yes, it is. $8 million.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.801
Again, why?

38:44.810 --> 38:46.209
The housekeeper
can't inherit it.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.198
Of course she can.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.566
No, according to
Illinois law, a caretaker

38:49.570 --> 38:57.250
to an invalid cannot
inherit more than $20,000.

38:57.260 --> 39:00.161
Dismissed.

39:00.170 --> 39:01.728
OK, 50/50.

39:01.730 --> 39:02.480

- Almost done.

really get Octagon.

39:24.010 --> 39:26.467
Yeah, I didn't think they did.

39:26.470 --> 39:28.859
I could see their faces.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.090
But I don't want to give
up on pitching new things.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.501

No.

you were talking--

No.
No, I wasn't.

that job, Eli.

of my employment.

I'm out to hurt you.
