00:22.605 --> 00:24.107
[Dottie] What are you doing, Love?

00:24.190 --> 00:27.068
That boy will distract you from your son.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.321
[Joe] I can't cage what's inside of me.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.450
Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,

00:33.533 --> 00:35.493
but make sure it knows the rules.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.080
So now I have you, Marienne.

Things will be different this time.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.536
Oh.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.375
If you look up "klutz,"
there's a picture of me.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.376
Oh.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.087
Okay.

01:29.422 --> 01:33.259
[Joe] Here's what I've learned about you
in the last few days, Marienne.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.013
You like things that make you feel.

01:37.096 --> 01:41.810
You're whimsical and artsy. You don't like
things that go together too perfectly.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.687
You find beauty in the flaws.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.523
Unexpected pairings.

01:46.606 --> 01:51.110
You're deep, reverent, rooted,

01:51.945 --> 01:54.114
yet adventurous.

01:56.616 --> 02:00.453
You're at home in chaos,
but something tells me not by choice.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.871
[water dripping]

02:07.127 --> 02:10.130
You take care of books
and art and young minds,

02:10.213 --> 02:12.507
but who takes care of you?

02:15.552 --> 02:18.680
No. No, no, no. This is not why I'm here.

02:18.763 --> 02:22.892
I'm here, well,
to figure out why I'm here.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.520
Why you, Marienne?

02:27.272 --> 02:30.150
So I must leave everything as I found it.

02:33.069 --> 02:36.781
I like following you.
You're interesting and unpredictable.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.535
And that inner part of me
that needs this is mostly satiated,

02:40.618 --> 02:44.372
but in the spirit of self-awareness
and maybe conquering that inner thing,

02:44.455 --> 02:45.915
I ask again,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.334
why am I drawn to you?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.920
-[Marienne] Great! Yeah, sure.

It's very unusual for you.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.937
Yes, yes, I know that place.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.358
Okay. Yeah, great. I'll see you there.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.821
[Joe] What's got you stepping
out of your routine?

03:16.905 --> 03:21.242
I dearly hope it doesn't involve
pegging someone on this bed. RIP Peach.

Of course.

-Decided to take some time off.

05:32.999 --> 05:37.170
With everything that happened,
felt like it was starting to get to me.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.340

-I can't. I've got stuff to do inside.

[Love] Remember when we crashed Dad's
beloved Maserati? We were all banged up.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.852
But better to suffer in silence
than let him know what we did.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.229
This feels like that.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.649
Only, I can't take this damaged thing
to the wrong side of town

If you were here, you'd laugh.
You said I'd be a terrible mom.

and there's no one I can tell that...

15:26.383 --> 15:28.636
To womanhood, motherhood

15:28.719 --> 15:30.846
and the entrepreneurial spirit.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.141
And cut. Yes!

15:34.224 --> 15:37.645
That was perfection.
I'll check this file and AirDrop you.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.022
The Internet is gonna swoon
when you post this.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.275
-Thank you for being here.
-Hey, Sherry.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.569
-Sweetie.
-Hi, Mom.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.282
-Did the nursery take our little man?
-Practically took him out of my hands.

15:50.366 --> 15:54.286
This could not have come at a better time.
You look exhausted.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.371
[Love] It begins.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.082
Yeah, I haven't made it to my room yet
but thank you.

15:58.165 --> 16:03.128
Trust me. Come Monday, you will be
the picture of relaxation. Want some?

16:03.837 --> 16:05.047
I'm good.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.299
Not pregnant, are you?

16:07.383 --> 16:10.928
-[Love] Keep it together. She smells fear.
-I'm on a mini detox.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.764
You are? Oh, my God.

16:14.181 --> 16:18.102
-Is it Joe's or that neighbor kid's?
-Keep your voice down. I was--

16:18.185 --> 16:21.563
I have seconds before kickoff.
We'll finish this later.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.483
Maybe a little lipstick, sweetheart?
You're pale.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.570
[Love] Remember pretending to be orphans?

16:28.654 --> 16:29.655
That was fun.

16:32.616 --> 16:33.909
[cell phone chimes]

16:41.875 --> 16:44.169
[Joe] Your work face, giving nothing away.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.014
Excuse me. Where's Narnia?

16:55.097 --> 16:58.267
Oh, it's in Kid Lit.
You see that tree over there?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.893
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

17:06.525 --> 17:10.279
You're leaving mid-shift?
Could this be opportunity knocking?

17:13.824 --> 17:15.242
Hey, Dante.

17:15.325 --> 17:19.371
Marienne asked me to take care
of the overdue notices?

17:19.455 --> 17:21.290
Was that at the desk here?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.625
Her office. She'll be back in an hour.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.336
Okay. I think she meant while she's out.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.505
So diligent...

17:28.589 --> 17:32.593
after taking three hours
to shelve that one cart this morning.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.387
Thank you.

17:46.857 --> 17:47.983
Okay.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.945
Doesn't exactly scream skeletons
but then neither do you.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.535
There's nothing in your work files
or search history.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.580
It's just, there's no "you" here at all,

18:01.663 --> 18:04.291
which tells me
I'm not looking hard enough.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.590
Hmm. "Recovery." This is a surprise.

18:11.673 --> 18:15.552
This deepens my curiosity,
and now I need more.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.647
"Child endangerment"?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.316
"Neglect."

18:29.399 --> 18:30.400
"Abuse."

18:30.484 --> 18:32.319
This can't be right.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.240
The ex-husband, I presume.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.451
The more I know,

18:39.535 --> 18:41.870
the less I understand.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.081
Who are you?

18:44.623 --> 18:46.416
What I do know,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.252
your problems are serious.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.420
You're a mess.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.214
I have a loving wife, a son.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.967
I can't have anything to do
with your red flags.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.594
This itch has been scratched.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.434
[Laura] "What did I want? A tarnished
marriage that takes so much work to heal?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.228
A family that consumed me?

19:06.854 --> 19:09.439
No, I deserved better.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.067
All at once,
I knew what that looked like."

19:12.151 --> 19:13.694
[Love] What does it look like?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.697
"I realized I had more to offer."

19:19.908 --> 19:21.535
And so, I started writing.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.871
Eventually, I started my own company,

19:23.954 --> 19:25.706
and it was hard.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.166
It was exhausting.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.335
But if I could do it, you can too.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.380
[Love] That's it?

19:33.964 --> 19:36.216
All right. Who has a question?

19:37.134 --> 19:40.220
-Yes, right here.
-Given all you've accomplished,

19:40.304 --> 19:42.014
how do you stay so humble?

19:42.097 --> 19:43.682
[Love] Is she joking?

19:43.765 --> 19:48.395
I start the first half hour
of every morning expressing gratitude.

19:48.979 --> 19:52.566
A great way to remember that none of us
can get through this life without help.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.611
All right. Who's next?

19:56.361 --> 19:59.740
If you're supposed to be giving us
the secret of joy,

19:59.823 --> 20:00.824
what is it?

20:02.284 --> 20:05.579
I don't hear you saying
what a 21st-century professional mother

20:05.662 --> 20:07.789
is supposed to do to find happiness.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.499
Simple.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.543
If you focus on watering your own grass,

20:11.627 --> 20:13.837
you never have to wonder
if it's greener anywhere else.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.716
But what does that mean? I--
I water my own grass, and I don't--

20:17.799 --> 20:20.636
-Okay, next.
-It's fine. You don't what?

20:20.719 --> 20:24.014
You don't feel how incredibly green
your own grass is?

20:24.097 --> 20:26.058
Is it possible
that you don't wanna succeed?

20:26.141 --> 20:30.270
That you feel guilty for what you have
and you sabotage your happiness?

20:34.608 --> 20:38.278
I would suggest a look inward
and read my book.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.448
To read more about your narcissistic climb
to success, when, poof,

20:41.531 --> 20:43.450
you suddenly discovered
you were deserving?

20:43.533 --> 20:45.786
Sounds like privileged bullshit to me.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.043
I'm not sorry.

20:53.126 --> 20:57.923
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
I do want to succeed, obviously, right?

20:58.006 --> 21:01.426
You are powerful. You are loved.
You are forgiven.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.929
Mm. Thank you.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.848
I am sorry.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.644
-We've moved on.
-It's not too late to turn the day around.

21:10.727 --> 21:14.523
Sherry had the brilliant idea, we do
an IGTV interview with each other and...

21:14.606 --> 21:16.191
We want you to be a part of it.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.903
-Interview for what?
-Our brands.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.948
But also to counteract
your little outburst.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.077
You were right about one thing.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.914
Women need to see other successful women
supporting each other.

21:30.998 --> 21:34.293
How better to use our privilege, right?

21:38.588 --> 21:39.423
Sure.

Hello, goddesses.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.896
and fellow twin mom Sherry Conrad.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.523
Sherry,

21:57.274 --> 21:59.109
your blog moves me.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.362
But it's your heart
that really touches me.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.864
Oh, Dottie.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.157
[Love] Oh, woof.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.076
You are a shining light for us all.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.705
-Thank you for being my soul sister.
-[Love] Vomit emoji.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.332
And last but not least,

22:13.415 --> 22:16.960
my pride and joy, Love Quinn-Goldberg.

22:18.462 --> 22:22.674
I'm so proud to have raised a daughter
whose grit nearly matches my own.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.718
-[Love] Nearly?
-Doing it all.

22:24.801 --> 22:29.264
Husband, business, 1-year-old,
all with possibly another on the way.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.348
Oh, my God, Mom.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.768
-Oh, my God, Love! Amazing!
-What the fuck?

22:32.851 --> 22:35.062
-What are you doing?
-Sherry, give us a second.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.856
-Love, I just--
-Seriously, get the fuck out.

22:39.066 --> 22:39.900
Thank you.

22:41.234 --> 22:45.072
How the hell could you do that?
I'm not sure. I haven't told Joe.

22:45.781 --> 22:49.993
It's not surprising. The problems
in your marriage keep stacking up.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.370
Mom, it has nothing to do with you.

22:52.454 --> 22:55.248
My life, my marriage, my womb,

22:55.332 --> 22:58.335
none of your fucking business,
and not to share on social media.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.921
-Don't speak to me like that.
-Somebody has to.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.965
You're the reason
Forty and I are fucked up.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.010
-Don't talk about him.
-No wonder that our life turned into this.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.888
All you ever showed me
was to get the prince,

23:09.971 --> 23:12.390
build a castle,
and then burn it all to the ground.

the mattresses in the world to sleep on

you ungrateful, little bitch.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.820
You have no idea
what I had to do to give it to you.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.156
Your choice to fuck the neighbor boy
or blow up your life

23:28.240 --> 23:33.036
has nothing to do with me and everything
to do with you being spoiled and bored.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.832
I'll take the blame for spoiling you.
But the source of your unhappiness?

23:36.915 --> 23:41.044

your hypocrisy at everyone else.

erase everything I've learned today.

-No way. You know the rules.

-[Goodwin] No.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.372
[Joe] Is that your ex-husband?

25:40.455 --> 25:42.749
[Goodwin] No, you don't have any rights,
you fucking junkie.

-You shouldn't have done that.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.429
I didn't ask for your help.

What part of "stay out of it"
did you not understand?

26:40.181 --> 26:41.850
Was that too hard?

-First of all, no.

to make you feel, right?

Raising kids is a whole different game

Yeah, I had been in a dozen foster homes
before I hit 18,

and still, even though I knew
it made no sense, I...

37:02.386 --> 37:05.097

my mom would show up and save me.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.559
She never did, of course,

37:09.143 --> 37:11.812
but sure made me wanna be
a better mom though.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.733
I held on to that same hope.

37:17.485 --> 37:18.569
For years.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.698
And got my ass kicked regularly for it.

how someone who treats you like that

38:01.779 --> 38:03.739
could have custody of your child.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.346
We were both addicts...

38:28.097 --> 38:29.598
when Juliette was a baby.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.727
One night, I...

38:33.853 --> 38:35.563
I sailed through a red light.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.025
And the other driver
was very seriously hurt,

38:39.108 --> 38:42.862
and the way that we collided,
if Juliette had been on the other side...

38:42.945 --> 38:44.613
[Joe] Reckless endangerment of a child.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.616
That disaster, and the fact
that he got clean before I did,

38:47.700 --> 38:49.702
is how Ryan got full custody.

38:52.121 --> 38:55.124
The lies he's told ever since is
how he's kept it.

38:55.207 --> 38:56.250
The lies?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.544
Well, you know, he's got money.

38:58.627 --> 39:01.547
Beloved local celeb, a white man.

39:01.630 --> 39:05.217
And I think we can both agree,
white men get a million chances in life.

39:05.301 --> 39:10.181
So when he accuses me of child neglect,
for not showing up for my visitation,

39:10.264 --> 39:11.724
they believe him.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.518
Even when I swear
he gave me the wrong address.

39:15.227 --> 39:18.731
He can have me arrested
for destruction of property

39:18.814 --> 39:22.902
for keying his car that I barely scratched
'cause I chickened out.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.570
And my favorite,

39:25.363 --> 39:28.491
verbal and emotional abuse
for calling him a dickhead.

39:30.993 --> 39:34.246
Yeah, and he's had this case built
against me for years,

39:34.330 --> 39:35.873
and everyone believes him,

39:35.956 --> 39:40.920
everyone takes his word over mine
because... who am I?

39:42.004 --> 39:43.047
I'm sorry.

39:43.672 --> 39:47.551
I'm so sorry for what you've been through.

39:50.679 --> 39:53.682
Nobody forced me
to get behind the wheel that night.

39:53.766 --> 39:54.600
That's...

39:55.726 --> 39:57.395
That's a choice I live with.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.815
Yeah, but everything else,

40:00.898 --> 40:02.066

-Well, I am working on it.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.281

for dinner last night.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.784

40:12.451 --> 40:14.870
He thinks joint custody is doable

40:14.954 --> 40:18.416
if I can just show
how I'm really doing now

40:18.499 --> 40:19.834
and the judge sees it.

40:20.668 --> 40:26.799
If I was sure Ryan could never find us,
I would grab Juliette and run to Paris.

40:28.008 --> 40:31.137
And spend our days
drawing outside Sacré-Cœur.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.057

measures up when you're a twin.

you are absolutely right.

My dad is a lot worse than I thought.

45:06.995 --> 45:11.708
I went into his office,
and he hired a PI to stalk people.

45:11.792 --> 45:16.755
And he has all this insane conspiracy shit

45:16.839 --> 45:19.091
about Natalie's murder

45:19.174 --> 45:22.928
with these names of people in Madre Linda,

45:23.011 --> 45:25.013
including you and Joe.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.265
[ominous music playing]

45:26.849 --> 45:27.766
What?

45:41.572 --> 45:44.408
Nurse Fiona,
I think you'll like this. It's--

45:51.415 --> 45:52.833
Wait for you outside, beautiful.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.342
Hey, kid.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.678
Love that book.

46:13.812 --> 46:16.315
Sorry, today is not a good day.
I have to--

46:16.398 --> 46:18.484
He gets mad at you and he hurts you.

46:19.151 --> 46:22.029
He says he's sorry,
it'll never happen again,

46:22.112 --> 46:24.490
and he gives you flowers, right?

46:27.784 --> 46:29.661
There are a lot of bad men out there,

46:29.745 --> 46:33.248
and sometimes you can't tell
until it's too late.

46:33.332 --> 46:35.292
Go outside and eat with the other boys.

46:51.433 --> 46:56.396
[Joe] I know now, Marienne.
I know why "you," and it's no pattern.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.650
But today starts the next phase

46:59.733 --> 47:03.862
of my growth to know you exist,
to see you, to love you even,

47:04.321 --> 47:05.864
and to never have you.

47:05.948 --> 47:09.701
Because as long as I love you,
you'll be in danger.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.330
Hi. Hi, can we talk?

47:13.413 --> 47:16.375
-We have a lot to do today.
-[Joe] You wanna forget what happened.

47:16.458 --> 47:18.585
Go back to business as usual.
I can't go back.

47:18.669 --> 47:22.297
It's only a matter of time before I'm
making treasure boxes for Love to find.

47:22.381 --> 47:24.758
-Marienne...
-I have feelings for you.

47:24.841 --> 47:26.969
I know nothing can happen.

47:27.052 --> 47:30.889
You're married,
with the cutest baby on the planet,

47:30.973 --> 47:32.933
and I'd never do anything
to split up a family,

47:33.016 --> 47:34.434
and I need you to know that.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.604
Not that you'd ever,

47:38.188 --> 47:39.773
obviously, because...

47:40.983 --> 47:42.526
you love your wife,

47:42.609 --> 47:47.322
and we were just exhausted
and caught up in the moment.

47:47.406 --> 47:50.576
So don't worry, I don't--
I don't want anything.

47:50.659 --> 47:51.535
I just...

47:52.244 --> 47:56.206
It can go away.
It can dissolve into nothing. Okay?

47:56.832 --> 47:57.666
Cool?

47:58.625 --> 47:59.459
Wait.

48:00.043 --> 48:03.338
It's-- It's not nothing.

48:04.047 --> 48:05.882
I'd never break up your family.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.095
-I'd never do anything to hurt Henry.
-I know.

48:11.888 --> 48:14.641
I'd never get in the way
of you getting your family back.

48:16.226 --> 48:18.729
-I would never hurt Juliette.
-I know.

48:27.988 --> 48:28.989
[Joe] Oh, no.

48:30.907 --> 48:31.950
We can't do this.

48:32.534 --> 48:33.368
I know.

48:33.452 --> 48:34.703
Shit.

48:40.125 --> 48:41.335
No, you...

48:41.418 --> 48:43.962
-You have to go before this...
-I know. We can't.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.881
I came here to quit.

48:45.964 --> 48:48.342
I thought this would make it easier.

48:48.425 --> 48:51.511
You don't have to do that.

48:52.095 --> 48:56.808
But we should talk
when we're a bit more clear-headed.

49:02.689 --> 49:05.025
[Joe] I have never felt more clear-headed.

49:05.108 --> 49:07.611
But I do need time to figure out
what I'm gonna do about Love.

49:10.656 --> 49:14.701
I won't let her hurt you, Marienne.
I'll never let anyone hurt you.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.496
I will stay ahead of her this time.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.498
-You're home early.
-Hey.

49:19.581 --> 49:21.958
There you are. Did you not get my texts?

49:22.876 --> 49:23.919
We need to talk.

49:24.002 --> 49:26.004
[Joe] She knows.
How the hell could she already know?

49:26.088 --> 49:27.589
-Is everything okay?
-No.

49:27.673 --> 49:30.550
Theo told me that Matthew hired a PI
to look into people.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.761
He doesn't think Natalie's case is closed.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.554
Okay. So, what does he have?

49:34.638 --> 49:36.473
I don't know,
but I may be able to find out.

49:36.556 --> 49:39.059
-How?
-We know Theo has a crush on me...

49:41.269 --> 49:43.480
-And you wanna use that?
-Sort of.

49:43.563 --> 49:46.650
Like, okay, I'm just gonna say it.
You can shoot it down.

49:46.733 --> 49:51.905
But I could... pretend
like he had a chance.

49:51.988 --> 49:55.117
Like, 19-year-olds will do anything
if they think sex is on the table.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.035
[Joe] Well, this took a turn,

49:57.119 --> 50:01.206
but if Love's focused on this,
she'll be too distracted to notice us.

50:01.289 --> 50:05.127
I know, I was-- It's crazy,
and I'm asking you for a lot of trust,

50:05.210 --> 50:06.753
-but I really--
-It's a great idea.

50:09.840 --> 50:10.966
I trust you.

50:11.049 --> 50:12.759
We are a team.

50:13.301 --> 50:14.511
The best team.

50:20.809 --> 50:22.477
[Joe] We are the best team.

50:22.561 --> 50:26.565
Even if we're not soul mates,
it's a kind of love.

50:26.648 --> 50:32.028
And it keeps her eyes somewhere else,
so the rest I can give to you.

50:32.112 --> 50:35.031
This is great for everyone.

50:40.537 --> 50:41.913
