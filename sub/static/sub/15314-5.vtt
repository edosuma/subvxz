00:34.195 --> 00:36.197
What have you got for me?

00:36.232 --> 00:38.320
Nothing.

00:38.355 --> 00:41.280
You killed Roger of Stoke. Allan...

00:41.315 --> 00:44.842
You knew I'd kill him. You Just
didn't want to admit it to yourself.

00:44.877 --> 00:46.760
You're low. Yeah.

00:46.795 --> 00:50.879
And YOU are here for more money.
So what do you want to tell me?

00:50.914 --> 00:52.760
You've got a messenger.

00:52.795 --> 00:55.878
Henry of Lewes,
arriving tomorrow, right?

00:57.475 --> 00:59.080
How do you know that?

00:59.115 --> 01:03.757
He's coming to tell you where and when the
King plans to land when he returns to England.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.560
But there's going to be an
ambush tomorrow on the North Road.

01:05.595 --> 01:09.463
So if you want Henry to make it to
Nottingham, you better change his route.

01:12.515 --> 01:14.142
Hey, hey, hey!
What do you call this?

01:14.177 --> 01:16.035
Noon tomorrow.

01:16.070 --> 01:17.684
Gold.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.558
IF Henry arrives.

01:37.035 --> 01:39.840
He's not coming.

01:39.875 --> 01:41.604
He's been tipped off.

01:41.639 --> 01:43.760
By who?

01:43.795 --> 01:45.920
Don't worry, he's
probably Just late.

01:45.955 --> 01:48.480
Horse needs shoeing or he's
stopped for a kip or something.

01:48.515 --> 01:50.540
He's here to betray the King!

01:50.575 --> 01:52.266
He's hardly going to stop for a nap!

01:52.301 --> 01:53.958
Could Marian have
got the time wrong?

01:53.993 --> 01:56.660
That's a good point actually.

01:56.695 --> 01:58.458
No, cos Marian's trying to listen
at keyholes and stuff, right?

01:58.493 --> 02:01.435
She could be making
all kinds of mistakes.

02:06.115 --> 02:08.197
She could be making a BIG mistake.

02:10.095 --> 02:12.325
Go back to the camp and stay there.

02:14.195 --> 02:16.676
Robin... What?

02:16.711 --> 02:19.158
That's an order.

02:19.575 --> 02:20.917
Robin...

02:23.935 --> 02:25.540
My Lord.

02:25.575 --> 02:28.195
What do you think?

02:28.230 --> 02:30.780
Hastings? Portsmouth?

02:30.815 --> 02:36.583
Which south coast port will King Richard
make his final, fateful landing at? Hmm?

02:36.618 --> 02:39.738
We'll know soon enough.
Henry's here. As I promised.

02:39.773 --> 02:44.024
Well done, Gisborne. Well done.

02:45.815 --> 02:47.521
Ah, Henry...

02:51.555 --> 02:54.966
Henry of Lewes.

02:55.001 --> 02:58.378
Welcome to my...

03:02.735 --> 03:05.300
Get me my physician!

03:05.335 --> 03:09.520
Get the Sheriff's
physician immediately.

03:09.555 --> 03:13.161
Why did you let the messenger
through? Has he talked?

03:13.196 --> 03:15.940
No, not yet. He was taken ill.

03:15.975 --> 03:19.502
Robin, I took a risk to find out his
route and you still let him through?

03:19.537 --> 03:21.258
You can't go back into the castle.

03:21.293 --> 03:22.740
What?

03:22.775 --> 03:25.120
Go to the forest. Now.

03:25.155 --> 03:27.225
I'll Join you when
I've silenced Henry.

03:27.260 --> 03:30.120
The forest? Don't be ridiculous!

03:30.155 --> 03:32.259
You told me he'd
travel by the North Road.

03:32.294 --> 03:33.779
Yes. And he didn't.

03:36.375 --> 03:40.061
Marian, I think I
have a spy in my gang.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.422
What are you going to do?

04:31.415 --> 04:33.224
I'll silence Henry.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.789
And then I'll find the traitor
in my own camp and silence him.

04:38.824 --> 04:42.804
None of your men have been in the
castle. I would have seen them.

04:42.839 --> 04:45.712
Then somebody's
going out to meet them.

04:45.747 --> 04:48.355
I'll keep watch.
No, you'll keep out of it.

04:48.390 --> 04:50.920
No! Marian, this is
none of your business.

04:50.955 --> 04:54.937
The King's being betrayed right now
because of your spy. It IS my business.

04:54.972 --> 04:57.062
But what if the spy has told them
about you and the night-watchman?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.659
Then I'm dead anyway.

05:10.135 --> 05:14.399
What are you doing, Blight?
He's worse. He's calmer. Calmer?

05:14.434 --> 05:18.663
You're calming him to death.
Medicine is a Journey, my lord.

05:18.698 --> 05:20.300
Not a destination.

05:20.335 --> 05:21.900
Treatments take as long as...

05:21.935 --> 05:24.403
Do you seriously think I've got
time for your Journey, Blight?

05:24.438 --> 05:25.817
A clue!

05:27.055 --> 05:31.640
Gisborne. You find me a quack
who knows what he's doing.

05:31.675 --> 05:34.781
A quack? Sheriff, I am a man of
learning. I give you science...

05:34.816 --> 05:38.882
Science? You have given me silence.

05:38.917 --> 05:41.935
I want this man to talk.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.658
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

05:59.355 --> 06:01.580
I know you're angry.

06:01.615 --> 06:05.119
You're angry because Henry of Lewes
got past us, but you can't Just run off.

06:06.635 --> 06:10.457
Much, you disobeyed my instructions.
I said wait at the camp.

06:10.492 --> 06:13.784
Gisborne has outwitted us. So what?

06:13.819 --> 06:17.040
His luck will run out. It has to.

06:17.075 --> 06:20.818
Otherwise we'll be asking where
he's getting his information from.

06:23.155 --> 06:24.656
What?

06:28.115 --> 06:30.845
You think he's getting information?

06:30.880 --> 06:33.804
From one of us?

06:33.839 --> 06:35.720
No.

06:35.755 --> 06:40.055
Master, surely some mistake.
A traitor?

06:41.795 --> 06:43.940
Who?

06:43.975 --> 06:46.876
That's why you've
sent us back to camp.

06:46.911 --> 06:49.639
Because you suspect.

06:49.935 --> 06:53.209
You suspect me?
Much, I have to suspect everyone.

06:53.244 --> 06:56.440
That's me. You suspect me.
Much, go back to the camp!

06:56.475 --> 07:00.684
What do I have to do to prove my
loyalty to you? What? Tell me. What?

07:00.719 --> 07:02.996
I'd chop off my own arms!

07:04.955 --> 07:08.516
Well, one arm, because once I've chopped that
off then I wouldn't be able to chop off the other.

07:10.675 --> 07:13.883
If you're true to me,
I ask Just one thing.

07:13.918 --> 07:16.321
You name it. Go back to the camp.

07:22.755 --> 07:24.245
Oh!

07:27.415 --> 07:28.655
Come, come, come.

07:31.595 --> 07:33.119
There you go.

07:34.395 --> 07:35.960
Oh!

07:35.995 --> 07:37.917
This baby's Just like his mother.

07:37.952 --> 07:39.598
Doesn't know up from down.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.120
Again? Oh, again.

07:42.155 --> 07:43.680
Don't you bother yourself.

07:43.715 --> 07:45.336
I'll turn him the right way up.

07:45.371 --> 07:46.958
How do you know it's a boy?

07:46.993 --> 07:50.061
Because I know.

07:51.915 --> 07:53.440
But it hurts.

07:53.475 --> 07:56.360
Hurts? You don't know pain.

07:56.395 --> 07:59.398
Try giving birth to him feet-first.
Then you'll know what pain is.

08:01.595 --> 08:03.560
Bring her medicines, everything.

08:03.595 --> 08:06.917
Sheriff wants your services.
Get off me! My daughter!

08:06.952 --> 08:08.758
Your daughter can wait.

08:08.793 --> 08:09.801
Mother!

08:11.935 --> 08:13.280
Mother!

08:13.315 --> 08:15.160
You hairy pig-witted fox turd!

08:15.195 --> 08:21.077
I'll pluck your eyeballs from your bony
skull and squelch them into cess pits! Mother!

08:21.112 --> 08:22.280
Rosa!

08:22.315 --> 08:23.840
Speak...

08:23.875 --> 08:25.957
Speak, speak, speak.

08:29.155 --> 08:34.342
Get off me! Keep still, woman!
Oh, you slimy little snot-head!

08:35.554 --> 08:36.440
Matilda...

08:36.475 --> 08:40.717
Blight! Ha!
It's the gravedigger's best friend.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.240
The maggot's mate!

08:42.275 --> 08:44.640
Couldn't you find a civil-tongued
wise woman?

08:44.675 --> 08:49.556
Apparently she's the one the civil-tongued
wiser men go to. Hello, baldy!

08:52.315 --> 08:54.021
Do you know who I am?

08:54.056 --> 08:56.260
I'm the Sheriff.

08:56.295 --> 08:58.500
And I have a Job for you.

08:58.535 --> 09:03.666
If you were on fire, I would not
damp you with my wet underwrappings.

09:03.701 --> 09:04.804
LAUGH

09:05.875 --> 09:08.580
Cure this man or you die.

09:08.615 --> 09:13.097
Anyone that you love and even some
that you have a passing liking for.

09:13.132 --> 09:16.100
I can't stay here!
My daughter's expecting a baby.

09:16.135 --> 09:21.584
Your daughter can expect a corpse for a
mother if you do not do as you are told!

09:21.619 --> 09:24.681
Well, I won't stay if she lays
one finger on my patient!

09:30.975 --> 09:33.740
If I treat him, can I go?

09:33.775 --> 09:37.518
Do you think I want you
cluttering up my castle?

09:47.375 --> 09:50.139
When he speaks, fetch me.
Immediately.

09:53.015 --> 09:57.338
We'll get rid of
these things, for starters.

10:00.695 --> 10:02.424
Sir, there's a sign at the Trip Inn.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.084
Marian.

10:08.135 --> 10:11.582
Where's your guard? I don't know.
I must have lost him.

10:11.617 --> 10:13.300
Watch Lady Marian.

10:13.335 --> 10:15.803
Is that really necessary?

10:18.335 --> 10:21.260
I don't know. Is it?

10:21.295 --> 10:23.195
Do you think I'm a threat?

10:25.015 --> 10:25.900
No.

10:25.935 --> 10:32.022
I was wondering if I could have a day away from
the castle and the guards and accompany you.

10:32.057 --> 10:35.621
I'm on business. Sounds interesting.
Marian, it's private.

10:35.656 --> 10:37.940
Sounds doubly interesting. Marian.

10:37.975 --> 10:42.218
No. Very well. But at least
let me have a day unchaperoned.

10:44.015 --> 10:46.500
You're up to something? Yes!

10:46.535 --> 10:52.417
I'm charming you so that I can have an
hour or two without a goon on my back!

10:59.755 --> 11:02.485
But you stay in the castle.

11:21.815 --> 11:27.538
Did somebody order leeches? Haven't I seen
enough bloodsuckers for one day? Mostly in charge!

11:27.573 --> 11:31.175
Lovely specimens. Hungry.

11:35.735 --> 11:37.305
Let's take a look.

11:53.775 --> 11:56.900
Robin of Locksley.
Mmm, what's that beard?

11:56.935 --> 12:00.382
It's neither grown nor shaven.
Make up your mind. Hey, Matilda!

12:00.417 --> 12:05.620
Has this man talked?
No. You can't treat him.

12:05.655 --> 12:07.100
Good.

12:07.135 --> 12:09.060
Get me out of this dung heap.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.940
My Rosa has a baby on the way.

12:10.975 --> 12:13.546
A boy I'd wager,
by the trouble he's caused.

12:13.581 --> 12:15.480
Twice turned himself upside down.

12:15.515 --> 12:21.385
You were worse, I seem to remember. Ah! This will
relax her while I turn him. Come on, let's go.

12:21.420 --> 12:24.260
I have business here first.
She needs me now.

12:24.295 --> 12:28.265
Do you know anything about this man?
Yes, he was stung by a bee. Look.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.800
What, this unwell? From a bee sting?

12:30.835 --> 12:33.338
Well, it can happen.
It nearly killed him.

12:33.373 --> 12:34.940
That and the leeches.

12:34.975 --> 12:37.261
But he's all right now. Wait!

12:38.935 --> 12:40.720
His name is Henry of Lewes.

12:40.755 --> 12:46.160
Now he's come to tell the Sheriff where the
King plans to land when he returns to England.

12:46.195 --> 12:51.963
So you should turn away. Stop! Has a dung beetle
tunnelled through your ear and eaten your soul?

12:51.998 --> 12:55.320
I'll be quick. A bee failed to kill
him, a quack failed to kill him,

12:55.355 --> 12:59.325
I'll be damned if a boy I delivered sneaks
in and finishes off one of my patients.

12:59.360 --> 13:03.640
Matilda! I can't let him live
to speak his treason.

13:03.675 --> 13:07.975
So it's not his life you're
afraid of then, it's his tongue.

13:09.515 --> 13:13.201
So? Shall we Just
cut out his tongue then?

13:13.236 --> 13:14.920
Oh, men!

13:14.955 --> 13:17.526
Always think in a straight line.

13:17.561 --> 13:19.000
I've got a better idea.

13:19.035 --> 13:23.836
Can you silence him? Long enough for you to
think of something better than killing him, yes.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.724
I can muddle his brain
for a day or two.

13:26.759 --> 13:29.036
Confuse and baffle him. Now...

13:35.275 --> 13:37.926
Oh, sorry!

14:00.355 --> 14:03.119
Well? Hasn't been in yet.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.720
Must be held up.

14:10.755 --> 14:13.200
When he finally arrives,

14:13.235 --> 14:16.800
give him this for delivering Henry.

14:16.835 --> 14:20.601
Tell him it's silver not gold,
because the goods were damaged.

14:23.915 --> 14:25.439
Thank you.

14:30.915 --> 14:32.837
He's waking.

14:34.635 --> 14:37.286
Matilda, quickly. Where am I?

14:37.321 --> 14:39.040
What is it?

14:39.075 --> 14:41.236
Here. It's mead.

14:45.795 --> 14:50.141
Right, Job done, let's go.
I have to know that it's worked.

14:50.176 --> 14:52.840
Do you want the sun
and the stars as well?

14:52.875 --> 14:57.244
He mustn't talk! If we spare his
life then we sacrifice the King's.

14:57.279 --> 14:59.283
Look lively, you pair of oafs!

15:03.735 --> 15:05.282
Is he awake?

15:06.915 --> 15:08.700
Henry!

15:08.735 --> 15:11.360
Mead! Horrible!

15:11.395 --> 15:15.160
Henry? My dear, Henry!

15:15.195 --> 15:19.825
Castle. Yes, yes,
this is Nottingham Castle.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.520
I've come from the Holy Land.

15:21.555 --> 15:24.220
Yes. I'll speak only to the Sheriff.

15:24.255 --> 15:28.146
Yes, yes. I am the Sheriff.
The Sheriff of Nottingham.

15:28.181 --> 15:31.060
The King...
Yes, which port will he arrive at?

15:31.095 --> 15:35.759
When the King returns from the Holy
Land... Yes, yes, yes, where will he land?

15:35.794 --> 15:37.360
What's the King's plan?

15:37.395 --> 15:43.425
He will land...
I feel strange. I feel...

15:43.460 --> 15:46.816
Yes, never mind how you feel, Henry.

15:46.851 --> 15:48.703
What's the King's plan?

15:48.738 --> 15:50.900
The plan King's.

15:50.935 --> 15:56.726
Planking. Port.
Yes, yes, which port? Pork.

15:56.761 --> 15:59.161
I have come from the holy pork.

16:01.495 --> 16:03.781
Which port?

16:03.816 --> 16:05.800
Pork.

16:05.835 --> 16:07.462
Holy pork.

16:11.155 --> 16:13.396
There's someone there! Guards!

16:24.455 --> 16:28.198
Get this to Rosa. Get out of here,
you rancid-faced outlaw!

16:28.233 --> 16:30.386
Don't stand on him, you idiots!

16:30.421 --> 16:32.540
Get him up, get him on the bed!

16:32.575 --> 16:34.218
Gently, gently, gently.

16:35.755 --> 16:38.896
Which port?

16:43.315 --> 16:44.816
Robin!

16:49.095 --> 16:50.660
Henry?

16:50.695 --> 16:53.698
He's silenced, but only temporarily.

16:53.733 --> 16:56.300
You're right, you have a spy.

16:56.335 --> 17:00.999
How do you know? I followed Gisborne to the
Trip Inn. Whoever he was meeting didn't come.

17:01.034 --> 17:03.380
A serving maid knew him
and he left money with her.

17:03.415 --> 17:08.421
I heard them mention Henry but I couldn't hear
other names. That's payment for Henry's arrival.

17:08.455 --> 17:11.316
Who is it, Marian?
Who would betray me?

17:14.694 --> 17:16.117
There's Gisborne.

17:24.635 --> 17:26.717
Marian!

17:28.454 --> 17:32.357
Guy. You've been following me. Me?

17:32.392 --> 17:34.000
Don't deny it. No, I...

17:34.035 --> 17:36.583
I saw you by the stall earlier.

17:36.618 --> 17:38.640
Now here. Coincidence?

17:38.675 --> 17:43.106
I was only... I don't think so. But I
Just... You disobeyed me. Guy, please.

17:43.141 --> 17:47.538
Let me explain. You don't understand.
Punish me but do not punish my father.

17:47.573 --> 17:51.005
Punish you? Why would I punish you?

17:51.040 --> 17:54.200
What have you been doing?

17:54.235 --> 17:57.181
Forgive me, you're right.
I disobeyed you.

17:57.216 --> 18:00.099
I Just wanted
to spend time with you.

18:00.134 --> 18:02.414
Really?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.660
Yes.

18:04.695 --> 18:07.880
Well, I'm honoured, Marian,

18:07.915 --> 18:11.282
but I told you I was on business.

18:12.815 --> 18:15.477
Well, it won't happen again.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.515
Shall we...?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.980
What's your problem? Eh?

18:39.015 --> 18:42.660
Did you speak to Robin then, or
what? Why do you want to know?

18:42.695 --> 18:47.541
We want to know what's going on. What's the
plan? Did the messenger get through to the castle?

18:47.576 --> 18:50.595
Is Robin going to kill him?
Like to know his plans, do you?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.367
What's the Sheriff
and Gisborne's plan?

18:53.402 --> 18:56.105
What? I mean, is there even a Henry?

18:56.140 --> 18:58.540
Or is it a trap? What?

18:58.575 --> 19:00.816
What's going on?
How much do they pay you?

19:00.851 --> 19:02.578
Pay who?

19:04.255 --> 19:07.782
There's a spy! In the camp.

19:07.817 --> 19:10.100
One of you is a spy

19:10.135 --> 19:12.922
and Robin knows. So you're done for.

19:12.957 --> 19:14.700
What?

19:14.735 --> 19:16.700
How does he know? It's obvious!

19:16.735 --> 19:19.720
Gisborne's always five
or six steps ahead of us.

19:19.755 --> 19:27.105
Are you calling me a traitor? Well...
Traitor? What you looking at me for?

19:27.140 --> 19:31.145
Well, you're the one who tried to
persuade me to steal from Robin.

19:31.180 --> 19:33.500
We thought the King was coming...
That's right!

19:33.535 --> 19:38.438
We thought about it. We decided against it,
didn't we? I said no! Allan. Stop it, now!

19:38.473 --> 19:42.100
Yes. If anyone's going to kill
the traitor, it's going to be me.

19:42.135 --> 19:47.357
What makes you so high and mighty? He doesn't
trust you either. Or why has he sent you back here?

19:47.392 --> 19:49.459
Ah! Stop it the pair of you.

19:49.494 --> 19:53.664
Off him, stop it!

19:53.955 --> 19:55.217
Robin.

19:56.975 --> 19:58.363
Master!

20:00.615 --> 20:02.700
What is going on?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.260
We're taking her to the camp.

20:04.295 --> 20:08.482
What, our camp? This is Rosa. Matilda's
daughter. So much for it being a secret.

20:08.517 --> 20:10.705
So much for a lot
of things being secret.

20:12.255 --> 20:14.917
DJaq, the baby's the wrong way round.

20:14.952 --> 20:17.460
Do you know how to turn it?

20:17.495 --> 20:19.543
Let's get you to a bed, shall we?

20:19.578 --> 20:21.264
You don't, do you?

20:31.155 --> 20:32.656
Get on with it!

20:39.915 --> 20:44.124
Your maJesty. He's not the King!

20:44.159 --> 20:46.120
Mother!

20:46.155 --> 20:48.040
His brain!

20:48.075 --> 20:51.385
Bled to dried pig skin
by his leeches.

21:14.195 --> 21:16.336
She's poisoned him! Rubbish.

21:16.371 --> 21:18.477
I haven't given him anything.

21:18.512 --> 21:21.000
I hate to tell tales,

21:21.035 --> 21:27.622
but I've asked around, and rumour has it that
she delivered the baby Robin into this world.

21:32.115 --> 21:34.320
Pig. Canker.

21:34.355 --> 21:37.756
Blight by name, blight by nature.

21:37.791 --> 21:40.200
Help, help!

21:40.235 --> 21:42.135
There's someone there.

21:43.715 --> 21:45.842
Oh, nice try.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.598
You poisoned him, didn't you?

21:49.633 --> 21:52.000
No.

21:52.035 --> 21:54.880
I Just gave him
something to help him sleep.

21:54.915 --> 21:58.316
Well, you can give him something
to wake him up, can't you?

21:59.995 --> 22:02.160
No.

22:02.195 --> 22:06.438
There are wrong answers
and there are right answers.

22:06.473 --> 22:09.400
That was a wrong answer.

22:09.435 --> 22:13.780
We need to know who the traitor is.

22:13.815 --> 22:18.159
I'm sorry. It's not
the sort of secret I can keep.

22:18.194 --> 22:22.460
Let's Just deal with Rosa first.
Tell us, Robin!

22:22.495 --> 22:27.159
Robin, there'll be people like Rosa who need our
help, but if we're not a gang, if you suspect us...

22:27.194 --> 22:30.780
All right, it's true.

22:30.815 --> 22:36.503
One of you is betraying us. You're meeting
Gisborne and you're selling our secrets.

22:39.055 --> 22:41.683
Not me.
It's not me either. It's not me.

22:41.718 --> 22:45.060
Not me.
Not me. Stop this now.

22:45.095 --> 22:49.498
If the guilty man or woman
confesses, right here, I'll listen.

22:51.255 --> 22:53.701
Tell me what Gisborne said,

22:53.736 --> 22:55.819
what he offered.

22:55.854 --> 22:58.296
Step forward now.

22:58.331 --> 23:00.700
You have one chance.

23:00.735 --> 23:04.341
I will not be treated
with equal suspicion!

23:11.295 --> 23:13.895
Well, whoever you are...

23:13.930 --> 23:16.054
you've made your choice.

23:16.089 --> 23:18.178
And I will find you out.

23:21.095 --> 23:23.541
Argh!

23:26.615 --> 23:28.105
John...

23:31.015 --> 23:33.222
Help me turn the baby. No.

23:34.775 --> 23:37.660
I have worked in the battlefield.
All men.

23:37.695 --> 23:40.380
I have never treated this before.
Neither have I.

23:53.735 --> 23:55.578
May I?

24:08.135 --> 24:10.720
Oh! What?

24:10.755 --> 24:13.069
It's the head!

24:13.104 --> 24:15.340
Hello, little one.

24:15.375 --> 24:18.297
Hello. The wrong way round.

24:18.332 --> 24:21.220
You need to turn, baby.

24:24.295 --> 24:26.536
SHE CRIES OUT

24:28.235 --> 24:30.977
It moved. That's it! That's right!

24:37.695 --> 24:39.424
How did you do that?

24:40.595 --> 24:42.540
Thank you.

24:44.035 --> 24:45.343
Thank you.

24:51.075 --> 24:58.322
My lords, Matilda here somehow managed to
bring a patient of hers back from the dead.

24:58.357 --> 25:02.000
Certified by my good self - dead.

25:02.035 --> 25:06.400
So, what do we have here?
Do we have a healer?

25:06.435 --> 25:10.997
What's happening? Or do we have
something else? A necromancer?

25:11.032 --> 25:12.963
A devil worshipper?

25:12.998 --> 25:14.920
A witch?

25:14.955 --> 25:17.920
She's not a witch!

25:17.955 --> 25:22.995
So, perhaps a ducking in Locksley
Pond would calm all our nerves.

25:23.030 --> 25:25.560
Guy, you know she's not a witch!

25:25.595 --> 25:29.040
Marian, say nothing. These
allegations spread by association.

25:29.075 --> 25:33.921
The ducking stool's a death sentence. You
know that. There's nothing you can do for her.

25:33.956 --> 25:38.124
Did I leave you to die
when you were being drowned?

25:38.159 --> 25:40.902
Guy. Guy!

25:43.795 --> 25:45.524
You could avoid this, Matilda.

25:45.559 --> 25:47.062
Tell us the antidote.

26:03.915 --> 26:08.420
Boiled Sheriff's brains
with parsley.

26:14.475 --> 26:16.580
To Locksley!

26:16.615 --> 26:18.686
SHE SCREAMS

26:24.855 --> 26:27.676
CRYING CONTINUES

26:27.711 --> 26:29.753
DJaq?

26:29.788 --> 26:31.796
Later.

26:34.115 --> 26:36.400
Are you all right?

26:36.435 --> 26:38.376
There's a spy in the camp,

26:38.411 --> 26:40.280
how can anything be all right?

26:40.315 --> 26:43.318
Well, he probably knows
he's made a mistake now.

26:43.353 --> 26:46.060
He had his chance to confess.

26:46.095 --> 26:49.758
Maybe he's stuck.
People get stuck, you know?

26:51.695 --> 26:53.660
Your brother said he was stuck.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.926
He refused to change
and he hanged for it.

26:56.961 --> 26:59.860
He was an idiot. No.

26:59.895 --> 27:02.320
He was a good man underneath it.

27:02.355 --> 27:08.658
And you saw that. And I believe
Robin would see it too.

27:08.693 --> 27:12.066
If the spy confessed...

27:12.101 --> 27:14.661
and begged forgiveness

27:14.696 --> 27:17.221
and changed his ways...

27:20.195 --> 27:22.959
I believe you're
a good man, Allan A Dale.

27:24.795 --> 27:26.797
ROSA GROANS

27:28.435 --> 27:30.255
HORSE WHINNIES
Robin!

27:32.335 --> 27:34.121
Robin!

27:41.355 --> 27:43.880
Robin! Matilda!

27:43.915 --> 27:46.040
The Sheriff knows she helped you.

27:46.075 --> 27:51.479
She's refusing to tell them how to wake Henry and
they're ducking her. When? Now, at Locksley Pond.

27:51.514 --> 27:53.818
Call your men,
I have to go before I'm missed.

27:53.853 --> 27:55.880
Robin! The baby's coming.

27:55.915 --> 27:58.566
Baby? It's Matilda's grandchild.

27:58.601 --> 28:01.080
Robin. Hurry, hurry!

28:05.275 --> 28:09.820
Matilda needs us.
DJaq, you stay with Rosa.

28:09.855 --> 28:13.996
Everybody else with me. Now. What's
happened? The Sheriff's happened.

28:14.031 --> 28:17.522
John, can you stay?

28:33.135 --> 28:35.842
Has he said anything sensible yet?

28:42.135 --> 28:45.184
Lords, ladies, peasants.

28:45.219 --> 28:46.970
Presents.

28:47.005 --> 28:48.680
Pheasants?

28:48.715 --> 28:51.340
Have a look at this noble man.

28:51.375 --> 28:54.344
He returned from the dead,
possessed!

28:54.379 --> 28:58.544
The witch shall be ducked.

28:58.579 --> 29:01.660
If she dies,

29:01.695 --> 29:06.496
it proves the devil has abandoned her and
she shall be buried on consecrated ground.

29:06.531 --> 29:10.220
Constipated ground.

29:10.255 --> 29:14.464
If she lives, showing the
devil still to be in her...

29:14.499 --> 29:16.100
she shall be burnt alive!

29:16.135 --> 29:18.820
Hard to know which one to hope for.

29:18.855 --> 29:21.255
Rosa!

29:21.290 --> 29:23.620
My Rosa!

29:23.655 --> 29:27.603
Down she goes. Deep breath.

29:41.175 --> 29:48.536
Oh, lovely grapes, Gisborne.

29:59.975 --> 30:03.103
MATILDA GASPS AND SPLUTTERS

30:05.355 --> 30:09.709
You weasel-faced whore's son!

30:09.744 --> 30:14.064
Who, Robin? No, Robin's not here!

30:14.099 --> 30:17.821
And three, two, one!

30:21.035 --> 30:22.741
Deep breath, deep breath.

30:30.675 --> 30:33.121
Agh! There's something...

30:34.735 --> 30:38.598
What's happening? It's fine.

30:38.633 --> 30:42.420
Your husband, is he away?

30:42.455 --> 30:45.424
The wars. He'd be so proud of you.

30:45.459 --> 30:49.400
What's your wife's name?

30:49.435 --> 30:54.975
Alice. So you've done
this before, with Alice?

30:55.115 --> 30:57.000
No. Why is it so hard?

30:57.035 --> 31:01.222
No, I was an outlaw in the forest.

31:01.257 --> 31:02.580
Alice was alone.

31:06.535 --> 31:08.540
Push now.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.545
SHE SCREAMS

31:15.715 --> 31:17.615
# Pom, pom, pom. #

31:53.635 --> 31:55.944
Agh!

32:00.175 --> 32:01.760
I curse you!

32:01.795 --> 32:06.562
May snakes crawl up your nose holes

32:06.597 --> 32:10.480
and feed on your tiny brain!

32:10.515 --> 32:12.181
Down, down!

32:33.435 --> 32:34.481
Breathe slowly.

32:40.915 --> 32:44.783
It's going
to be difficult to take him. Henry.

32:44.818 --> 32:46.280
Can't we Just kill him?

32:46.315 --> 32:49.523
No, draw attention to Robin,
won't we? Put him in danger.

32:49.558 --> 32:52.996
We bide our time, wait
until they're distracted.

32:53.031 --> 32:55.520
Unless one of you two's
informed Gisborne.

32:55.555 --> 32:57.403
Keep your accusations to yourself!

32:57.438 --> 32:58.885
You keep pumping!

33:00.595 --> 33:05.479
Let's lift up the carcass.

33:05.514 --> 33:10.363
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

33:10.398 --> 33:13.006
six, five,

33:18.655 --> 33:23.342
one... and a half, and bring up!

33:39.995 --> 33:43.300
What the devil is that, Blight?

33:43.335 --> 33:47.715
I suspect they may be
her underwrappings, my Lord.

33:47.750 --> 33:49.603
Shut up! Shut up!

33:52.235 --> 33:53.760
Arrest, arrest!

33:53.795 --> 33:59.665
Gisborne! Henry's gone, Gisborne!
Henry's gone. Guards, find him!

34:12.835 --> 34:17.784
Rosa, where's my Rosa?

34:17.819 --> 34:19.356
Rosa?

34:21.995 --> 34:24.520
Mother? Where's the little lad?

34:24.554 --> 34:27.478
Tell me the lad's all right. No lad.

34:27.514 --> 34:29.284
No lad?

34:37.975 --> 34:40.029
Good lungs, she has.

34:40.063 --> 34:42.040
Not a moment's peace!

34:42.074 --> 34:47.239
Well, let's see if her damp
grandmother can't set her off again.

34:49.114 --> 34:51.188
Hey, my little...

34:51.223 --> 34:53.262
What's her name?

34:53.297 --> 34:54.800
Alice.

34:54.835 --> 34:57.281
I'm going to call her Alice.

34:57.316 --> 34:58.765
Alice.

35:08.095 --> 35:09.756
Still in the land of fairies.

35:12.515 --> 35:14.848
What are you going to do with him?

35:14.883 --> 35:17.140
I'll banish him. We should kill him.

35:17.175 --> 35:20.406
A traitor to the King
doesn't deserve to live.

35:25.595 --> 35:28.569
Oi, Much. Look!

35:28.604 --> 35:31.544
Much, meet Alice!

35:40.455 --> 35:44.141
Put him down, Henry!
They say you don't kill any more.

35:44.176 --> 35:47.020
For the King, I kill.
The King's finished.

35:47.055 --> 35:51.856
The Sheriff, Prince John and
the Black Knights, they'll win.

35:51.891 --> 35:53.459
Robin...

36:07.455 --> 36:09.696
Not today, they won't.

36:18.775 --> 36:20.345
Can I trust you, Will?

36:20.380 --> 36:22.576
Of course.

36:24.335 --> 36:25.900
I need your help.

36:25.935 --> 36:30.702
Anything. Marian saw a serving maid
speaking to Gisborne. At the Trip.

36:30.737 --> 36:32.420
She'll know who our spy is.

36:32.455 --> 36:36.903
I can go to the Trip, find the maid
and make her tell me who the traitor is.

36:36.938 --> 36:38.977
You go back to the camp at sundown.

36:39.012 --> 36:40.733
Where am I going?

36:40.768 --> 36:42.455
This is gonna hurt.

36:47.235 --> 36:48.805
What's he doing?

36:50.395 --> 36:52.204
Robin! Master!

36:52.455 --> 36:54.764
Sundown, remember?

37:02.195 --> 37:03.740
I knew it was him.

37:03.775 --> 37:05.356
I knew it was him. Will?

37:05.391 --> 37:09.420
No! I knew it!

37:09.455 --> 37:11.808
Robin... Will's the spy.

37:11.843 --> 37:14.120
This subJect's closed.

37:14.155 --> 37:16.860
Will, Robin, I do not believe!

37:16.895 --> 37:20.058
I need to speak with you. Not now.
Believe me Robin, I need...

37:20.093 --> 37:21.738
No you don't, DJaq!

37:21.773 --> 37:23.658
Trust me!

37:23.693 --> 37:25.500
Will's gone.

37:25.535 --> 37:30.086
And that's the end of it. Now, I have to go
to the castle. I think he had a go-between.

37:30.121 --> 37:31.700
- At the castle?
- Yes, at the Trip.

37:31.735 --> 37:35.160
Marian saw a serving girl
receiving money from Gisborne.

37:35.195 --> 37:39.700
I have to meet Marian to find out exactly
what Gisborne knows... We'll come. No, no.

37:39.735 --> 37:43.440
I'm safer on my own.
Meanwhile, you lot have to scatter,

37:43.475 --> 37:48.640
until I find out whether Gisborne knows about
the camp. I'll go to the Trip at sundown.

37:48.675 --> 37:50.500
Come back here after that.

37:50.535 --> 37:52.325
I'll tell you what I know.

37:55.695 --> 37:57.560
What are we going to do?

37:57.595 --> 37:59.135
You heard him.

37:59.170 --> 38:00.676
We scatter.

38:04.735 --> 38:06.420
You're late.

38:06.455 --> 38:08.537
I was going to keep your money back.

38:10.975 --> 38:18.859
Silver. Not gold. You're going to tell Gisborne to
keep this money. I'm not doing this any more, right?

38:18.894 --> 38:21.881
I've changed. It's a bit late
for a conscience, isn't it?

38:21.916 --> 38:23.740
Yeah. Very late.

38:24.495 --> 38:25.496
Ah!

38:28.375 --> 38:30.104
Robin...

38:42.555 --> 38:44.340
You're early.

38:44.375 --> 38:47.105
Leave us. Stay there. Get out!

38:54.115 --> 38:56.436
I need to talk...

38:56.471 --> 38:58.141
to my spy.

39:02.315 --> 39:06.058
What was that with Will?
You banished Will. It was an act!

39:06.093 --> 39:10.060
Only she knew who was guilty.

39:10.095 --> 39:13.701
And I knew the spy would want to come
here before me to cover his tracks.

39:13.736 --> 39:16.937
For all I knew, it could
have been Will standing there.

39:17.915 --> 39:20.463
But it's not, is it?

39:23.595 --> 39:25.880
It's you.

39:25.915 --> 39:28.618
Robin, it was over. You ask her.

39:28.653 --> 39:31.321
I made a decision. Then what's this?

39:31.356 --> 39:32.896
I was giving it back!

39:34.895 --> 39:36.720
So you betray me.

39:36.755 --> 39:39.724
You betray yourself,
you betray your King.

39:39.759 --> 39:41.520
For what?

39:41.555 --> 39:44.520
For a few silver coins?

39:44.555 --> 39:47.023
What have you told Gisborne, Allan?

39:49.715 --> 39:52.800
Nothing really.

39:52.835 --> 39:58.398
Does he know about the camp?
No! Does he know about Marian?

39:58.433 --> 40:03.003
No! More lies?

40:03.038 --> 40:05.960
No!

40:05.995 --> 40:08.395
This was the last time, I promise.

40:08.430 --> 40:10.320
And I was wrong.

40:10.355 --> 40:16.237
But he captured me, Robin. He tortured me,
I had no choice. Everything is a choice!

40:16.272 --> 40:18.703
Everything we do.

40:22.195 --> 40:24.402
That's easy for you to
say though, isn't it?

40:27.355 --> 40:32.080
You get the glory, you get the girl.
Everyone loves you.

40:32.115 --> 40:38.202
Then when the King comes back, you'll have land,
property, a wife. Everything. What will I have?

40:41.728 --> 40:44.103
You're always in the sun, Robin.

40:44.138 --> 40:46.978
And I'm always in the shade.

40:47.013 --> 40:50.531
Is that meant to be an excuse?

40:50.566 --> 40:54.006
Give me another chance, please.

40:54.041 --> 40:58.091
I wouldn't let Gisborne hurt any of us.
I've never told him anything like that.

40:58.126 --> 41:00.236
Harmless lies? Innocent betrayals?

41:00.271 --> 41:02.626
They don't exist, Allan.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.981
Robin, I've changed.

41:06.515 --> 41:10.070
How can I get you to believe that?

41:10.105 --> 41:13.625
You can't. And the funny thing is...

41:15.185 --> 41:17.801
.. you might be telling the truth.
I am!

41:17.836 --> 41:20.417
How am I supposed
to believe you any more?

41:20.452 --> 41:24.472
Robin, I swear to you on my life!

41:29.647 --> 41:30.671
Don't kill me.

41:32.107 --> 41:33.711
Please.

41:41.547 --> 41:44.550
You're lucky I've left you
with a life to swear upon.

41:47.387 --> 41:52.313
Never, never let me set eyes
on you again.

42:05.787 --> 42:07.277
Are we safe?

42:10.347 --> 42:13.272
Will!

42:13.307 --> 42:15.772
Will? It's all right.

42:15.807 --> 42:19.208
It's all right. It wasn't him.

42:19.243 --> 42:20.708
What?

42:23.007 --> 42:25.272
It was a trap.

42:25.307 --> 42:27.147
I lied to you, I'm sorry.

42:27.182 --> 42:28.987
I had to lure the spy.

42:33.987 --> 42:35.388
It was Allan.

42:35.423 --> 42:36.790
Is he alive?

42:38.327 --> 42:40.170
Where? He's gone.

42:40.205 --> 42:42.352
Allan, why?

42:42.387 --> 42:44.572
For money, John. Why else?

42:44.607 --> 42:46.978
I believe he could have changed.

42:47.013 --> 42:49.350
You knew it was him? I didn't know.

42:49.385 --> 42:52.931
I guessed. I knew it was him.

42:52.966 --> 42:55.191
I knew it was Allan.

42:57.607 --> 43:00.172
Will, you forgive me?

43:00.207 --> 43:03.267
It worked. And the rest of you?

43:06.967 --> 43:10.255
Travellers on the North Road.

43:10.290 --> 43:12.692
Right.

43:12.727 --> 43:15.172
Are you with me?

43:15.207 --> 43:18.096
Yeah? Well then, let's go.

43:24.567 --> 43:27.812
What are we celebrating? The
signing of an important document.

43:27.847 --> 43:31.408
This is a Traitor's Charter. The Sheriff is
making the Black Knights sign their allegiance.

43:31.443 --> 43:34.410
If you love peace, do not sign.
It'll cost you Sussex.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.911
I have lost Sussex!
I am Sir Guy's man.

43:39.327 --> 43:42.452
Traitor! Marian? She's not here.

43:42.487 --> 43:46.412
Winchester wants you.
I need to give this note to Marian.
