00:41.320 --> 00:44.051
Bo, it's Mr. Granger.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.841
I called as soon as I heard. I'm so sorry.

00:48.440 --> 00:53.168
I know I've never met your mom,
but if you were any reflection of her,

00:53.280 --> 00:56.170
she must have been someone really special.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.049
I just want you to know, uh,

00:58.160 --> 01:01.369
I understand the pain
you're feeling right now.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.488
It feels kind of like the world is ending.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.084
And when I've been in that spot,

01:05.160 --> 01:08.289
I just wish someone had been there to tell me

01:08.400 --> 01:11.483
to not let the now disrupt the future.

01:11.560 --> 01:15.963
That scholarship proves you're one
in a million, Bo, don't forget that.

01:16.680 --> 01:20.480
I'm here if you need anything.
Don't ever hesitate to call.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.449
End of message.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.609
Delete, press seven. Save, press nine.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.850
Deleted.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.361
Okay.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.128
That the one you want? You could swap it out.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.327
Yeah, I'll keep this one.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.085
All right, can you show
everyone what card you have?

01:47.200 --> 01:49.362
Not me, just show everyone what you have.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.728
Sweet, so I want you to put
that card in your shirt pocket,

01:52.840 --> 01:56.367
really make sure there's no way
I can see it or touch it.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.046
All right, all right, so I'm gonna
take another card, all right?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.810
Four of hearts.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.769
Now, go ahead and hold
your hand over your card.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.882
Really make sure
there's no way I can touch it.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.968
- Yeah, for sure.
- Oh, wait.

02:07.040 --> 02:11.807
Ah, you were just a little too slow,
so you should have my heart.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.766
Weird, uh, does anyone else have the card?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.245
Oh, my God.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.923
Oh, my God!

02:27.360 --> 02:28.441
No way!

02:29.760 --> 02:31.285
That's insane.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.361
How did you do it?

02:40.160 --> 02:45.007
As you can see,
there's no string at all, all right?

02:49.200 --> 02:51.043
What's your name?

02:51.120 --> 02:52.406
Uh, Holly.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.760
You can grab it, Holly.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.604
How did you do that?

03:07.920 --> 03:09.001
You ready, T?

03:09.080 --> 03:11.651
- Yeah.
- All done for the day.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.370
- What you reading?
- Hatchet.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.204
Oh, okay. I read that forever ago.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.009
- I almost cried when he first...
- Stop!

03:17.080 --> 03:18.650
I'm only three chapters in.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.404
Oh, my bad. My bad.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.444
- Let's head out.
- Okay.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.051
You about to ruin my book.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.202
I had a long day today.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.648
Made this ring levitate
in front of this girl's face.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.285
- Remember the trick I showed you?
- Uh-huh.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.641
T, stop leaving your stuff
in the living room.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.804
- You forgot the mail.
- Thank you.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.001
Georgi.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.081
Hey, what's up?

05:16.160 --> 05:17.730
Hey, are you around tonight?

05:17.840 --> 05:19.365
Yeah, you working?

05:19.440 --> 05:22.570
Um, yeah, I'm making Tina dinner now,
but if you wouldn't mind getting her to bed?

05:22.640 --> 05:24.404
Yeah, no problem.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.769
- You have a good day?
- I did, yeah.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.085
I just got back from Graffiti,
finished a whole chapter,

05:31.160 --> 05:33.686
which somehow feels like
I've been to war and back.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.525
If I stare at the page for one more
second, my eyes are gonna bleed.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.170
You?

05:38.240 --> 05:39.241
Nothing, it was fine.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.841
Okay. Well, I'm gonna take a shower
real quick and then I'll be over.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.445
Okay, thank you.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.250
- Yo.
- There he is.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.607
- What up, Bo?
- What's up, man?

05:58.680 --> 06:00.489
Hello.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.931
- What's up, buddy?
- What's up, dude?

06:02.560 --> 06:04.483
- Luna's in the office.
- Okay.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.849
- Luna.
- Bo.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.884
Thank God. I'm having
an "I need drugs" situation.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.121
Get in here.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.602
I mean, DJs? I don't know what they're doing.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.411
They will ask for a blow-up doll
two months in advance

06:29.480 --> 06:30.720
and then drugs day of.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.610
Like, I don't know how I'm supposed
to turn that around for you, buddy.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.806
This what your ride is gonna look like?

06:34.920 --> 06:35.967
Oh, God, no.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.687
I'm a beer and pizza gal.
This? This is nonsense.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.809
I am so over this gig.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.763
Me, too. Later.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.009
- Yeah. Cheers, dude. Be well.
- All right.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.402
- Oh, so, we don't get a trick?
- Oh.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.400
What's that?

06:55.560 --> 06:56.800
It's my wallet!

06:56.880 --> 06:58.006
He just gave me my fucking wallet.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.286
You...

06:59.360 --> 07:00.600
When the hell did he take it?

07:00.680 --> 07:01.966
Later.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.203
This is my phone! What the hell!

07:05.320 --> 07:06.446
What are you laughing at?

07:08.600 --> 07:09.886
Are you Bo?

07:10.320 --> 07:11.446
Yeah, get in.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.721
Okay.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.888
Hey. Hi, I'm, uh, Noah.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.409
I got your number from some friends.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.130
So, it's, uh, $60?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.964
For three. Yeah.

07:30.040 --> 07:34.125
Three. Can I ask, is it one molly per person?

07:34.200 --> 07:36.123
Or should I...
Do you think I should get more?

07:46.920 --> 07:49.321
Do you sell coke? Can I also get coke?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.641
Can you even do molly with coke?

08:02.040 --> 08:05.522
I met these girls, and it's kind
of cool to know a guy, you know?

08:05.600 --> 08:07.682
Sounds kind of dumb when you say it, but...

08:07.760 --> 08:09.888
Hey, listen, man, whatever you want.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.442
But, honestly, don't buy drugs
to impress girls.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.925
I'll take the molly though.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.601
$60.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.529
The ATM would only give me $100.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.965
I know we said three,

08:24.040 --> 08:25.246
but I've got $100 here.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.606
Um, that's no worries,

08:26.680 --> 08:27.681
- I can give you five for...
- One...

08:28.840 --> 08:30.001
- Shit!
- Hands up!

08:31.520 --> 08:34.364
What are you doing back here?
What'd you just have in your hands?

08:34.440 --> 08:35.601
Uh, nothing... Nothing, sir.

08:35.679 --> 08:36.681
Why did he take off running?

08:36.760 --> 08:37.921
I think he was just scared, sir.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.409
If I search your pockets,
am I gonna find anything illegal?

08:41.480 --> 08:42.481
No, sir.

08:42.559 --> 08:43.799
Turn around.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.008
Hands on your head. Interlace your fingers.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.926
Where'd you put it? I saw you
stash something in your pocket.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.207
I don't know what you're talking
about, sir. I don't have anything.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.850
You put something in your pocket!

08:55.960 --> 08:57.530
I don't have anything, sir.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.847
See anything?

09:06.560 --> 09:07.686
Get the fuck out of here.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.407
Oh, my God!

10:03.760 --> 10:05.603
No, no, no, no!

10:06.840 --> 10:08.205
Bo, I'm sorry!

10:10.560 --> 10:12.847
Don't pour water on hot oil, okay?

10:12.920 --> 10:14.604
It can start a fire!

10:14.680 --> 10:16.045
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.885
I was just trying to make you breakfast.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.367
What was this?

10:26.040 --> 10:27.166
Bacon.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.489
Man, let's... Let's clean this out.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.642
I'll show you how to make it
the way you like, all right?

10:34.720 --> 10:35.801
Okay.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.446
Sorry.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.721
Come here.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.166
You scared me.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.480
Sorry.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.721
Here, grab the soap.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.481
What's up?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.361
Come on in.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.729
You have been doing good.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.201
Keep it up and these assholes
will be working for you one day.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.681
Everything else good?

11:52.760 --> 11:54.046
Yeah, just dealing the shit out.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.406
Nothing much else really going on.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.527
Okay.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.847
You got a girl these days?

11:58.120 --> 11:59.406
Nah, just my little sister.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.166
Well, actually,
I'm meeting with this girl tomorrow.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.321
It's our first time out.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.640
No shit.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.485
- Where'd you meet her?
- Just out and about.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.242
Ooh! Attaboy.

12:11.320 --> 12:12.685
You know what?

12:12.760 --> 12:14.524
First date is on me.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.921
No, no, no, I can't take that.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.249
Oh, please, no worries, man.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.402
I was wondering if you
could do me a favor though?

12:20.480 --> 12:22.164
You still selling over at Daedalus?

12:22.240 --> 12:23.685
Yeah, it's my biggest pull.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.889
I've been hearing there's
a new coke supplier in the area.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.405
They got someone selling there, too.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.091
You mind keeping an eye out?

12:29.160 --> 12:30.685
- Sure.
- Perfect.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.000
I just need the name of the supplier.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.087
Well, I'll let you know what I find out.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.161
Sounds good.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.446
Have fun on that date.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.686
Thanks.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.761
All right.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.966
Hey, did that guy just buy from you?

13:14.240 --> 13:15.366
No.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.570
No? Well, it looked like
he just bought from you.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.766
Nah, man, I think you're mistaken.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.080
Oh, come on, I'm just trying to party,
have a good time, you know.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.844
Sorry. Sorry, man.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.241
Well, I mean, all that money,
I'm sure you've got something.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.640
I don't got anything for you.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.721
- Come on, man...
- I said...

13:30.560 --> 13:32.528
I said I can't help you.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.686
Fine.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.921
Fucking punk ass.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.325
Yo.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.323
Look like the supplier's name is Maurice.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.247
Yep.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.967
Hey.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.601
Uh...

14:19.600 --> 14:20.886
Good to see you again.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.325
We really didn't get a chance
to meet last time.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.645
Hence me giving you my number.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.289
Right.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.405
Yeah, I was just getting off work,
that day when I saw you performing.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.970
So, you work on Larchmont?

14:33.320 --> 14:34.970
Yeah, yeah, Crumbs bakery.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.001
I sell giant cupcakes a couple days a week,

14:38.080 --> 14:40.560
but I'm at community college
racking up credits.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.280
Awesome.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.169
Oh, uh, here, sorry.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.085
Thank you.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.321
So, you do magic?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.080
I mean, a little.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.129
I'm getting pretty good at it.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.730
You know, I have never seen
a cute magician before.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.566
I'm starving.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.164
He sent a card on my birthday,
but that's about it.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.004
I haven't seen him in about a year.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.806
Yeah, he moved out fast. Like, crazy fast.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.089
Well, I mean, at least Arizona's
not that far if you wanted to visit.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.730
That's what he said. Yeah.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.770
It's funny though, 'cause,
like, I get it, you know.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.081
Like, my mom has always been a handful.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.607
And Arizona, it's far enough away
for him to get away from her,

15:29.680 --> 15:32.365
but close enough to still come see me.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.522
Not that he does, but whatever.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.601
It doesn't really bother me,

15:35.680 --> 15:37.808
but my mom is definitely still
dealing with the whole thing.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.803
And she really needs me right now.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.728
But once my mom is better, I can figure
out where I wanna finish up school.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.321
Mmm.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.003
God, I'm sorry. I feel like
I've been talking for hours.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.650
No, I asked. It's fine.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.566
What about you?

15:54.800 --> 15:57.963
Well, my dad passed a while back,
and my mom passed last year,

15:58.040 --> 16:01.249
so it's just me and my little sister,
Tina, the love of my life.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.729
She's such a smart kid, you know.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.401
I just wish I can move her into
a neighborhood with a better school.

16:06.520 --> 16:07.965
- Yeah.
- Surround her with better people.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.970
Yeah.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.122
She's gonna be something big. I know it.

16:14.200 --> 16:18.131
I grew up in a school district, and, honestly,
except for one teacher I had, nobody cared.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.804
And I just...

16:19.880 --> 16:20.881
Do you need to get that?

16:21.600 --> 16:22.601
No.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.210
It's fine. Get it if you need to.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.521
Okay, it'll just be a second.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.721
Yeah.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.161
Yeah.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.086
Totally, man.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.285
Yeah. I'll be right there.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.921
No, it's cool.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.684
I'm the worst. I'm sorry, I gotta go.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.081
Society of magic ruining
a perfectly good first date?

16:54.520 --> 16:56.602
I'm sorry.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.649
I'm kidding, it's fine.

16:58.720 --> 17:01.451
I promise. Let's do this again, though.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.761
Please.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.084
Ought to be good enough for you, young buck.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.444
Hey. Ready?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
What's going on?

17:22.119 --> 17:23.884
Found out where this Maurice guy lives.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.882
Homie moves into our backyard
and starts selling coke like I don't exist.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.644
I mean, we're gonna pay him a little visit.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.888
Talk to him about etiquette.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.121
Let's go.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.844
Put that shit out. Smoke after.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.691
Yeah, put that shit out, man, smoke it after.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.406
What the fuck?

18:31.520 --> 18:33.363
Sit down, loser! Sit down!

18:35.640 --> 18:37.369
Maurice, right?

18:37.440 --> 18:38.851
Check to make sure no one else is here.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.606
Get up.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.966
So, here's what I don't understand.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.286
You moved to this neighborhood,
started selling,

19:06.560 --> 19:08.483
and never thought to introduce yourself?

19:08.560 --> 19:10.722
Man, listen, I don't give
a fuck about who you are.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.562
See, that's the problem with kids like you.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.611
You come out hot-tempered and bad-mannered.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.721
There's no respect.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.685
I don't even know you.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.683
And I don't need to know you.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.684
Maurice, now don't play me like that.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.168
You can't say you've never heard of me,
because you guys are out there telling people

19:31.240 --> 19:33.163
that your shit is cheaper than mine.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.242
So, you know me well enough
to compare yourself.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.206
That's not good business.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.441
Where the fuck do you come from
where people do business like that?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.161
West Covina?

19:44.280 --> 19:45.361
Yo... You know what?

19:45.440 --> 19:49.206
Why don't you just get the fuck
outta here, old man?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.411
Here, here, here, take some chips with you.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.771
Oh, shit.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.569
Wow! What... I mean...

20:02.840 --> 20:04.171
That's what we're gonna do now.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.846
Okay. See, even your boys
are talking like you.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.282
Sit the fuck down! Now!

20:12.560 --> 20:14.164
You gotta lead by example.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.841
Maurice. Maurice.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.882
You and I, we could be friends.
We really could.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.571
And if you don't like me,
we could at least be co-workers.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.281
And we both know you don't always
have to like your co-workers.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.044
So, your options.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.441
You can go back to wherever
the fuck you came from,

20:42.520 --> 20:49.005
or you can get comfortable, stay right
here, sell my shit, and kick me 30%.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.161
Think about it.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.846
Let me know.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.969
All this weed and no snacks?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.363
Man, this party's whack.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.001
Fuck!

21:05.520 --> 21:06.806
Man, get the fuck up.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.242
That gun slipped out of
your hand like some cartoon shit.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.322
We gotta put sticky tape on it next time.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.765
Yo, you're one of my boys now. Word?

21:41.040 --> 21:42.883
I never thought it'd get dangerous.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.887
You guys never done
something like this before?

21:49.880 --> 21:51.882
A stick-up? No.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.644
Hell no. And that's
what I liked about Angelo.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.961
I mean, he didn't seem like the gangbanger.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.691
Just a cool guy who'd help me make
money off kids who wanted to party.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.286
I don't know, this is turning into something
I would've never signed up for.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.604
And I thought this whole thing
would be temporary.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.240
I mean, a year flashes by
and I'm still a drug dealer.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.405
I need to get out of this, Georgi.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.521
Now.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.969
Eight of clubs, okay? Keep it facing me.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.485
So, the card is gonna stay in your hand.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.483
I'm not messing with it. This is all you.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.001
All right. So, I need you
to name another card.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.208
Any card besides the eight of clubs.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.041
Three of diamonds?

23:00.120 --> 23:01.087
Three of diamonds. You sure?

23:01.160 --> 23:02.889
You can change your mind.
You're making all the decisions.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.200
- Three of diamonds.
- Okay.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.446
Turn it around.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.881
Oh, my...

23:10.000 --> 23:11.240
No way!

23:11.400 --> 23:12.970
Are you kidding me?

23:24.160 --> 23:25.844
- Uh, hey!
- Hey, what's up?

23:26.960 --> 23:27.961
Not much.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.081
What are you up to?

23:31.680 --> 23:33.125
Just out performing.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.969
- Are you working tonight?
- Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.161
Cool, where at?

23:38.320 --> 23:42.006
Uh, NoHo, maybe hit CityWalk in a bit.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.560
Tourists love magic.

23:45.800 --> 23:49.763
Damn, I was just, you know, seeing if you
wanted to catch a movie or something.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.729
Uh, maybe tomorrow night, though?

23:52.560 --> 23:54.050
I could make you dinner maybe?

23:54.520 --> 23:55.726
All right.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.362
Are you gonna be working? I can pick you up.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.569
Perfect. Oh, shit, I have a customer.
Text me.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.841
Oh, oh...

24:18.320 --> 24:21.244
Okay, any one you want, all right?

24:21.320 --> 24:22.321
Okay.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.890
I want you to sign your name on that card.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.481
You don't need to hide it from me,
we all should know which one is yours.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.127
Shuffle your card into the deck.
Get it lost in there.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.287
Perfect.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.169
And there's a lot of things
in our lives that can trap us.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.651
It could be a person, a problem.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.484
There're so many things that can wall us in.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.847
But these barriers only exist if we let them.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.651
We can do whatever we want
if we just believe we're able to.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.324
There's a card in here
with your name on it, right?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.447
Uh-huh.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.371
Let's say 51 of these cards are
too scared to trust themselves.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.329
Too afraid to believe that they
can do whatever they want.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.401
Okay.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.843
Now, your card, your card knows
there's no wall, no limit, no barrier.

24:55.920 --> 24:56.921
Okay.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.081
Is that your card?

25:00.160 --> 25:01.400
Oh, my God.

25:01.640 --> 25:02.641
No, it's not.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.324
So, where did you meet?

25:24.600 --> 25:25.726
On Larchmont.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.290
He was performing outside my work.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.651
- I like your nose ring.
- Thanks.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.568
I want one, but Bo says they're ugly.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.091
Oh, does he?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.326
He said so.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.650
So, is Bo your boyfriend?

25:42.320 --> 25:43.606
Uh, we actually just kind of met.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.490
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Yeah.

25:45.800 --> 25:46.801
Three of them.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.369
Three? Who are these boys?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.884
Jacob, Elijah and Daniel.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.806
I'm gonna die alone.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.726
I thought boys might like you.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.445
Well, you need to let them
know you got a big brother

25:59.520 --> 26:01.204
who'll beat them up if they ever get rude.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.321
Okay.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.927
So, she's a lot cooler than you.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.444
I have no idea how this happened.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.523
Yeah, well, family dinner
is a totally normal second date.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.681
Good job there.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.285
Was that bad?

26:20.360 --> 26:21.885
You're fine. You guys are cute.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.521
Yo.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.727
You weren't picking up.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.168
Oh, my bad. My phone is charging in my room.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.321
Oh, my bad.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.803
Hello there, ladies. I'm Angelo.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.200
I work with Bo.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.441
Hi, I'm Tina.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.204
- I'm Holly.
- Georgi.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.090
Very nice to meet you.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.889
You must be Bo's little sister?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.970
Yeah, and Holly is maybe-Bo's-girlfriend.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.367
And Georgi's our friend.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.284
Well, you have a good one on your hands here.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.045
I'm so sorry for interrupting,
but I just need to talk with Bo for a minute.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.686
- Chat outside, real quick?
- Yeah.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.121
What's up?

27:10.200 --> 27:13.124
So, that motherfucker Maurice
didn't take my warning too seriously.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.725
The dude's back out there selling again.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.126
Like, really, man?

27:17.800 --> 27:20.041
We hear he's partying nearby.
Ought to catch him on his way out.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.483
Right now?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.449
We're in the car. Hurry up.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.486
Uh, hey, guys.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.289
I have to head out with Angelo for a second.

27:44.680 --> 27:45.681
I like him.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.408
Um, can you watch Tina
for, like, a few hours?

27:50.560 --> 27:51.925
- Yeah.
- I can stay, too.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.446
I mean, I don't wanna put you out or
anything, I'm sure you've got things to do.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.601
I don't mind.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.889
Honestly, I'd rather stay if that's cool?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.086
Please stay.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.326
We'll see you when you get back.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.441
Thanks.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.170
Hey. What was he doing here?

28:17.280 --> 28:18.281
Yeah. It's weird.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.367
Yep.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.169
- It's cool.
- Always the same with me.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.529
Why are we leaving? It was fun.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.806
'Cause I'm fucking tired.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.405
You can stay if you want to.
I don't even care.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.720
You're my ride.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.086
Well, then I guess it's time to go home.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.246
God damn it.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.288
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Come on, baby.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.765
- Damn it!
- Let's go. Let's go.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.361
Let me go, man.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.330
Grab the tarp from under the sink.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.241
I thought we had a deal, man?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.811
Man, we had no deal about nothing.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.280
See, this is why I fucking kidnapped you.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.368
Look, man, if it's about
a percentage, then fine.

29:05.440 --> 29:09.047
Homie, homie, homie. This is not
about a percentage anymore.

29:09.160 --> 29:14.320
You are here because we made an agreement,
and then you decided that you were above it.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.524
Now, how the fuck you think
that makes me feel?

29:17.720 --> 29:18.926
Put the tarp down.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.365
You right-handed or left-handed?

29:20.440 --> 29:21.441
Am I what?

29:21.520 --> 29:23.170
Are you right-handed or left-handed?

29:24.440 --> 29:25.441
I'm a leftie.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.006
A southpaw?

29:27.680 --> 29:29.125
I feel like you're fuckin' lying.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.006
Maybe not.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.281
Tighten that around his left arm.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.288
In case you're wondering,
I'm not gonna kill you tonight.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.126
You know what they used to do
to liars and thieves back in the day?

29:42.480 --> 29:44.209
Wait, wait. Hey! Come on, man, wait.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.441
They'd cut a hand off.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.126
Spread 'em out.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.964
Wait... Come on, man. Wait, what are you...

29:49.040 --> 29:50.405
As clean as you can.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.209
- What?
- As clean as you can.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.645
- No.
- Why the fuck not?

29:53.720 --> 29:54.846
I can't. I'm sorry.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.207
Hey, Bo! This dude does not respect us.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.009
He doesn't give a fuck about us.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.686
And if we don't show him who we are,
he will come after us.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.091
Whose side are you on, Bo?

30:03.880 --> 30:07.362
Come on. Come on, Bo. Come on.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.411
Come on, man. Please, please, please.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.851
Don't do this, man, please. Okay?

30:11.920 --> 30:13.331
I'm asking you. Please don't do it, man.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.367
Come on, don't do it, man, please.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.727
Please, please, no, don't do it, man, please.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.802
Please, man, don't do it, okay?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.285
Please, man, don't do this, I'm beggin'.

30:22.640 --> 30:23.801
Let's go.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.484
Come on, please, please,
please, please, please.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.925
His hand or yours, Bo.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.408
Please don't do this.
Please, please, please. I'm begging you.

30:29.480 --> 30:30.481
Please, please, don't do this.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.567
Bo!

30:37.080 --> 30:38.081
Fuck!

30:39.040 --> 30:40.565
You're gonna have to do it harder than that.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.441
No!

30:48.120 --> 30:49.121
No!

30:55.280 --> 30:56.486
There you go.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.487
You're fucking done.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.084
If I hear that you're selling again,

31:08.160 --> 31:11.960
I'm gonna kill you and every person you know.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.486
Now, get the fuck out of my house.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.801
Let's go.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.810
There's gonna be a little more business
with Maurice out of the picture.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.050
You can handle a key, right?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.360
Yeah. Of course.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.361
Boom.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.960
Your normal re-up's in there, too,

31:51.040 --> 31:54.091
but you're gonna be working with
a lot more money, so pay attention.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.200
Oh...

32:02.280 --> 32:03.930
I'm having a party at the crib this weekend.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.843
You should come through.
Bring your girl if you want.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.808
If not, a bunch will already be there.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.841
Word.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.361
Hey.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.361
Hey.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.966
Why don't you take my bed?

32:46.600 --> 32:47.886
You don't need to sleep on the couch.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.081
Oh, shut up.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.810
We can sleep in the same bed.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.924
Hey, uh, you want a T-shirt or something?

33:06.800 --> 33:08.325
Yeah, sure.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.690
Hey, uh, thanks for watching T tonight.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.491
Oh, um,

34:50.560 --> 34:53.484
what kind of cookies are you going to make?
Or are you gonna make a cake?

34:53.560 --> 34:55.005
What makes you think I'm baking something?

34:55.120 --> 34:57.327
Because you have two boxes of baking soda.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.686
Oh, uh...

34:59.960 --> 35:02.566
I'm not sure. We'll figure out something.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.046
Holy shit. How much is that?

35:12.720 --> 35:14.370
It's almost two kilos.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.521
One of Angelo's cut with baking soda.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.766
This is a bad idea.

35:20.480 --> 35:24.962
Selling all this, I could pay Angelo
his cut and still walk away with $15,000.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.211
That's enough money to get out.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.049
Even if you sell all this, you really
think Angelo's gonna let you leave?

35:34.040 --> 35:35.929
I don't know.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.126
I hope.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.681
I know it's not my place to say this,

35:42.800 --> 35:45.121
but there's no one else
here to say it to you.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.760
I don't want you to do this.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.166
It's too dangerous.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.646
I'm sorry. It's already done.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.931
Hey!

36:30.040 --> 36:31.690
I'd like to re-up.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.010
Or reorder.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.527
Hey.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.761
Wait, what? What happened?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.080
Where are you?

37:16.760 --> 37:18.330
I can come over.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.771
No, that's fine.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.200
I'll meet you at my place.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.241
Hey.

37:46.640 --> 37:47.846
Hey.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.806
Thanks.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.320
She doesn't mean it.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.849
It's just the divorce
that's still hurting her.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.890
And I don't know, when she drinks,

38:08.360 --> 38:10.727
she just has a hard time moving on. It's...

38:14.360 --> 38:15.521
But she hits you.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.364
I mean, I saw your bruises the other night.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.766
No one deserves that.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.369
You can stay here as long as you need to.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.731
I mean, it's not the Four Seasons,
but we try to keep it pretty clean...

38:39.280 --> 38:41.169
Sorry.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.323
I'm never the girl with the mascara
running down her face.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.361
Thank you.

39:07.520 --> 39:08.760
Morning.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.845
You sleep okay?

39:11.440 --> 39:12.646
What is that?

39:13.320 --> 39:14.446
What?

39:15.520 --> 39:16.726
That thing in your arm?

39:19.280 --> 39:20.691
Oh, uh...

39:21.640 --> 39:23.130
It's part of an effect.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.921
But what is it?

39:26.880 --> 39:29.201
It looks kind of infected.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.441
It's not that bad.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.370
Bo, for a magic trick?

39:36.680 --> 39:38.011
Why would you do that to yourself?

39:53.040 --> 39:55.725
The first time I ever saw a magic trick,
I was with my mom and dad

39:55.800 --> 39:57.245
on the Venice Boardwalk.

39:58.520 --> 40:03.162
And there was this guy, this old
Italian guy with this little Jack Russell.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.288
He had this small stand where he performed.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.362
He did a lot of card and coin stuff,

40:09.440 --> 40:13.570
but there was this one thing he did
that just stuck with me forever.

40:17.480 --> 40:22.042
He took a pocket knife and
pressed it into the center of his hand.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.688
It went through his skin with a hard push.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.365
Popped through the other side.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.084
He held his hand right in front of my face.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.889
It didn't make any sense, you know.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.249
It looked like it was going straight through.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.286
So, he asked me to pull it out.

40:47.280 --> 40:51.569
So, I grabbed the knife,
and it just slid right out.

40:52.640 --> 40:56.531
When he showed me his hand,
there was no blood, no hole.

40:57.880 --> 41:01.005
Nothing to say that there was just
a freaking knife stabbed through his hand.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.887
My 7-year-old brain was just exploding...

41:09.120 --> 41:10.121
So I asked him.

41:10.680 --> 41:11.761
I asked him how he did it.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.401
What'd he say?

41:15.240 --> 41:17.846
He said he could only share
his secrets with other magicians.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.286
I went back last year
and saw that he was still there.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.800
I showed him a few tricks,
we talked shop for a little bit.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.884
And I told him the same exact
story I just told you.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.764
Did he tell you how he did the trick?

41:37.800 --> 41:38.926
It wasn't a trick.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.126
It was real.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.085
I mean, for a year, this guy
stabbed a knife through his hand.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.925
Each time, he cut a little deeper,
let the scar tissue grow.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.601
Then do it again.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.250
After a while, he had stabbed
a clean hole straight through.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.762
And because of the scar tissue,
there was no blood.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.450
So, when he performed, he just covered
his hands with a little bit of latex

42:03.720 --> 42:05.404
and it'd look like brand-new skin.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.881
That's the effect.

42:10.440 --> 42:14.809
I mean, it's so obvious, but you
wouldn't think anyone would go that far.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.331
Yeah, he cut a freakin' hole in his hand.

42:19.400 --> 42:23.450
I mean, is all that
worth it just for a trick?

42:24.600 --> 42:26.967
I mean, can't you do tricks
that don't hurt you?

42:29.240 --> 42:34.086
Anyone can learn a trick,
but doing something no one else

42:34.160 --> 42:35.969
is willing to do makes you a magician.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.285
I can do something no one else can.

43:33.640 --> 43:36.007
So, you think the spirit
is sitting in the right chair?

43:36.240 --> 43:37.287
Yeah, I think so.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.647
And you?

43:38.880 --> 43:40.166
Yeah, I agree, right chair.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.361
I mean, are you sure?

43:41.440 --> 43:44.130
You can change your mind, 'cause
I'm going to ask it to get up in a second.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.687
Okay.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.880
Spirit, would you leave the table please?

44:22.920 --> 44:24.160
Hey, man.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.770
Yeah, I was heading over there in a few.

44:28.840 --> 44:30.046
Word. Later.

44:42.920 --> 44:43.921
Yo!

44:45.520 --> 44:47.602
This kid right here.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.920
This kid's a little pimp.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.840
Hey, do a shot with me.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.248
To the young buck, Bo.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.805
Go find yourself a boo.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.605
Everybody, get naked.

45:19.960 --> 45:24.329
Like, when I drop that mixtape,
dawg, it is fucking game over.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.402
There are bars on it, son.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.289
Bars.

45:29.360 --> 45:31.408
And I work with this cat who's probably

45:31.520 --> 45:33.568
gonna be producing Ye's new album.

45:34.040 --> 45:36.008
The good lord, Yeezus.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.728
Bo, let me talk to you for a sec.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.845
Yo, Angelo, where you been at?

45:43.960 --> 45:45.121
Something came up.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.481
Word.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.840
I just wanted to ask you
something real quick.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.126
Yeah, what's up?

45:56.200 --> 45:57.929
Why the fuck are you cutting my drugs?

45:59.280 --> 46:00.566
I don't know what you're talking about, man.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.165
We're not gonna play this game.

46:02.280 --> 46:04.328
You ungrateful piece of shit!

46:04.400 --> 46:07.483
I gave you a job when you needed it most,
and now you're fucking me?

46:10.800 --> 46:12.643
How much did you cut it?

46:13.680 --> 46:15.489
Just another kilo, man.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.244
I swear I was gonna pay you back.

46:17.320 --> 46:18.321
Fucking hell.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.441
I swear. I swear. I swear.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.247
No, no, no, no, no!

46:22.320 --> 46:23.845
Come here, you motherfucker.

46:24.360 --> 46:27.011
Please, please. No, no, no. No, no.

46:36.680 --> 46:38.125
You know what?

46:38.200 --> 46:40.202
I want my kilo's full value back

46:40.320 --> 46:42.322
without you taking a cut. Obviously.

46:42.720 --> 46:45.087
Another 15 since you doubled my product.

46:45.160 --> 46:48.960
And let's throw one more 15k
on top of that for asshole tax.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.047
So, if you're following me, that's 45k,

46:52.200 --> 46:54.441
and I want it by midnight next Sunday.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.165
Get the fuck out of my house.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.086
Hey, close the door.

47:51.240 --> 47:52.730
- Bo, what happened?
- I don't want Tina to see.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.211
What happened? Hey.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.930
I messed up, okay?

47:56.000 --> 47:58.207
I messed up bad.

47:58.280 --> 48:01.090
Tell me what happened. Tell me what happened.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.363
If you never want to see me again, I get it.

48:09.160 --> 48:11.208
I mean, I really hate that
I was lying to you about it,

48:11.280 --> 48:13.487
but, honestly, I thought
I'd be out of this by now.

48:16.200 --> 48:18.686
You don't seem like the type of girl
that'd want to date a drug dealer.

48:18.760 --> 48:20.046
Okay, stop.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.005
I'm gonna help you figure this out.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.164
There's no way I can get that kind of money.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.561
I only have $5,000 saved up.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.923
Okay, but you have to try, right?

48:35.760 --> 48:38.764
If he's as bad as you say he is,
you don't have a choice.

48:45.160 --> 48:47.367
Look, sell off what you have.

48:48.400 --> 48:51.722
Keep performing until you can find
a way to get the rest of the money.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.529
And I'll see what I can do, too.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.404
To working in hell.

49:42.840 --> 49:46.731
$35,914.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.484
You sold everything?

49:48.560 --> 49:49.925
Everything.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.561
Here.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.165
What's this?

49:56.960 --> 49:58.485
It's only $900.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.601
Wait, where'd this come from?

50:00.760 --> 50:01.841
I had it saved up.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.241
It was supposed to be
for school applications.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.321
Holly...

50:05.400 --> 50:06.845
You're not allowed to give it back.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.441
I don't even know what to say...

50:14.560 --> 50:15.766
You don't have to say anything.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.648
You know I'll pay you back.

50:22.600 --> 50:23.761
Yeah.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.766
Now, how do I get nine grand
by midnight tomorrow?

50:57.320 --> 50:58.401
Fuck!

51:03.400 --> 51:05.289
Is something bad going to happen to us?

51:09.120 --> 51:10.167
What?

51:11.440 --> 51:12.487
No.

51:13.960 --> 51:15.450
You're scared.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.161
I know.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.570
I'm sorry, T.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.683
It's just hard being a grown up
sometimes, that's all.

51:32.200 --> 51:33.850
What's happening?

51:34.920 --> 51:36.285
Nothing you need to worry about.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.930
Well, I hope it's over soon.

52:10.200 --> 52:11.770
I'm not gonna make it.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.050
I've got six hours.

52:15.400 --> 52:17.004
Then what are we doing in an arcade, Bo?

52:18.200 --> 52:19.804
Oh, my God!

52:19.880 --> 52:21.484
Yes! I won! Oh, my God!

52:27.240 --> 52:29.288
- Hurry up.
- Hey. Tina, Tina.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.201
Let's get you something to eat.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.925
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.846
Here. Try this one.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.285
What's the deal with these things?

52:45.720 --> 52:47.210
Maybe over here.

52:48.600 --> 52:49.647
Come on...

52:49.760 --> 52:51.250
Please, it's so close.

52:51.320 --> 52:52.401
Come on, buddy, you can do it.

52:52.600 --> 52:53.647
And this time...

52:53.960 --> 52:55.485
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.681
I did it.

52:57.120 --> 52:59.088
Yes, yes! Oh, my God!

53:00.960 --> 53:02.883
Yes! Yeah!

53:04.400 --> 53:06.880
Yes! Okay, let's go over here.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.611
Over there.

55:14.280 --> 55:15.770
...got a set on the 12th.

55:17.240 --> 55:18.401
But we already have somebody for the 14th.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.767
Plus, you guys have always
done better on Saturdays.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.160
I think it's a bad idea, but...

55:22.240 --> 55:24.129
- How much?
- Fifteen.

55:24.200 --> 55:25.645
If that's what you wanna try.

55:26.800 --> 55:27.926
You can take 'em off.

55:29.200 --> 55:32.249
No, I mean, it's on you.
If you wanna take that risk.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.724
I mean, look, it doesn't matter to me.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.522
Door set is the same, no matter what.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.602
Split on my end is fine, so I mean...

55:42.720 --> 55:44.768
It just depends on whether
you can bring people out.

55:45.920 --> 55:47.081
All right, you just let me know.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.607
Hey. Sorry.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.442
Okay, that is yours, this is mine.

55:54.760 --> 55:55.761
Are you taking off?

55:55.880 --> 55:56.927
I might stick around.

55:57.760 --> 55:58.841
Yeah, you should.

56:00.200 --> 56:01.406
I'll buy you a drink.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.209
I just got some great news.

56:03.600 --> 56:04.840
- Okay.
- You up to that?

56:04.920 --> 56:06.445
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

56:10.640 --> 56:12.290
Oh, man.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.761
You been out here yet?
It's nuts. Nuts tonight.

56:14.840 --> 56:15.841
Packed.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.404
You gonna tell me the good news, or no?

56:19.520 --> 56:20.521
Yeah.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.244
But it's good news, so I'm telling you
at the bar with a drink in my hand.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.810
Okay, well, I'll meet you at the bar, then.

56:24.880 --> 56:27.008
I'm just gonna hit the bathroom real quick.

56:27.080 --> 56:28.320
Oh, yeah. No problem.

57:28.920 --> 57:29.921
Fuck.

58:15.240 --> 58:16.287
Shit.

58:18.360 --> 58:19.407
Where the hell did you go?

58:20.600 --> 58:22.602
I grabbed the wrong guest list.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.523
There's a party of eight under Speranza?

58:38.000 --> 58:39.240
Yeah, they're good.

58:39.440 --> 58:40.805
Coming back now.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.291
All right, what are you drinking?

59:13.400 --> 59:14.765
Um, let me get that one right there.

59:14.840 --> 59:15.887
Which one?

59:16.160 --> 59:17.491
That Casamigos there.

59:18.600 --> 59:19.726
Oh, yeah. That's good stuff.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.481
So, I got a job.

59:24.840 --> 59:25.887
Really?

59:25.960 --> 59:27.291
Yeah, buddies of mine have a band.

59:27.360 --> 59:31.729
They're going on a tour next week.
It's shit money, but it's not this.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.730
Oh, my God. That's great.

59:34.840 --> 59:36.171
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Yeah.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.844
- Hey, to getting out.
- To getting out.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.844
All right, I'll catch you later.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.210
Chase his ass, and I'll go get the car.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.281
Let's go, let's go.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.051
What's up, boy? Where you going, man?

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.121
Nah, nah, nah.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.531
What's up, black star?

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.886
Where you going, man?

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.564
You piece of shit.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.081
Got me out here running around.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.684
Let me see that.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.085
What, you like games or something?

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.805
Come on. Come on.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.441
Shit.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.610
Are you fucking serious?

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.485
Here. Come here, come here.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.130
- Hello?
- You got a watch?

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.686
Where's my money?

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.851
I'm almost there.
I just need a little more time.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.362
I didn't ask for you to get close, Bo.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.091
I asked for 45k by midnight tonight.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.647
I just need some more time.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.170
I want another 5k.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.650
Why couldn't I go in the house?

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.681
Um...

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.569
I'm gonna pick you up
from school today, okay?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.766
Okay.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.166
All right. I love you.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.241
I love you, too.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.091
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.122
I don't know what else to do.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.525
I can't get any more money.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.922
I did everything that I could.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.881
I don't know, nothing's working.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.446
Holly, I almost died.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.881
What?

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.249
You and Tina have got to get out of here.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.168
You've gotta get out of LA.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.767
And I wanna come with you.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.523
But what about school and your mom?

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.168
What you said the other night,
that I don't deserve this.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.482
I really needed to hear that.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.170
I do deserve better.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.926
And you do, too.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.802
Look, you guys could get out of here now,

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.081
and I'd only be a few weeks behind you.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.527
My semester's almost over, and I could
apply to some new schools over the summer.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.489
But where would we go?

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.286
Excuse me. Have you seen my sister?

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.805
Tina? Tina Wolfe?

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.564
Yeah, I think your uncle picked her up.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.250
Uncle?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.885
- T, where are you?
- Homie, did you think I was kidding?

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.241
Angelo?

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.729
Get me my fucking money.

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:56.441
If you touch my...

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.005
Everything okay?

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.130
I know you're in class,

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.170
just wanted you to know that it's looking
like I'll be working late tonight.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.484
I need you to snag T after school
and get her to dance class.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.970
It's that studio on Walden.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.604
She knows where.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.648
I'll be out in plenty of time to pick her up.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.804
Oh, and there should be a 20 on the fridge.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.163
Go ahead and order yourself something
if you get hungry before we get back,

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.607
but no pizza tonight, please?

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.925
Text me and let me know
that you got this message, okay?

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.049
All right? I love you.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.091
End of message.
To replay this message, press...

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.761
Bo?

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.402
Hey, Mr. Granger.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.521
You all right?

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.169
- I, uh...
- Come in. Come in.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.802
It's a little complicated.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.011
It always will be.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.765
Anything I can do?

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.801
Do you remember the last project
I did senior year?

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.567
Bo.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.731
Building an electromagnet
in a shoebox is one thing,

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.765
but in your arm?

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.850
How long has this been infected?

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.403
I'm taking care of it.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.568
It doesn't look like it.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.129
The negative is fed to my thumb and
the positive to the rest of the fingers.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.129
The board is programed to read
all the different inputs.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.931
It gives me a little bit of control
over pitch, yaw and roll.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.003
But I need more power.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.089
I mean, the lithium-ions last a while,
but their output, it's just...

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.883
I need more output.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.641
Have you always run the battery
straight to the electromagnet?

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.249
- Yeah.
- Huh.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.605
What about a feedback oscillator?

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.847
A feedback oscillator
would magnify the voltage.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.729
You could do that without touching the coil.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.448
But with a higher voltage,
you'll be running into a new problem.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.569
You see, these wires in your arm are thin.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.010
You'd want a larger gauge
with that much power,

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.809
otherwise, it could overheat.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.091
But it's still possible, right?

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.886
Yeah.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.651
I think so.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.204
So, a feedback oscillator.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.245
And a bigger battery.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.170
Do you have a soldering iron?

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.771
This isn't for a trick, is it?

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.168
For what it's worth,
I didn't want to bail on the scholarship.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.530
But I had to.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.246
I just want you to know that.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.041
I do.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.441
Thanks.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.966
Please be careful.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.246
Listen, uh, if I'm not back in a half
an hour, call the cops, okay?

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.570
It's like, "You're so fat, why are you
"living in your mother's house?"

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.724
Bo.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.007
You gotta be out of your fucking mind.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.726
Everybody, get out! Get out!

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.003
Angelo!

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.366
What the hell is goin' on?

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.401
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.167
You have my money?

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.321
Where's my sister? Is she here?

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.367
That's not the deal.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.124
Angelo, where the hell is my sister?

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.291
Give me my money.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.961
This had nothing to do with Tina.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.326
You crossed a line when you took her.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:41.362
Bo, the fucked-up thing about all this,
man, is that I liked you.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.010
You did good work.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.361
And you know what, I invested in you.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.603
But I'm getting so tired of people
who have no fucking respect.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.364
I'm trying to build something here,
and every corner I turn,

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.451
there's another piece of shit who
thinks they can just fuck me over.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.603
You did it behind my back,
you did it to my face.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.163
I mean, where's the common fucking decency?

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.003
I'm not gonna stand here and have
you roll up inside my house,

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.765
fucking my shit up,
telling me you deserve some shit.

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.891
So, let's make this an example.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.363
Not for you, but for the next
motherfucker who thinks it's a good idea

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.646
to fuck with Angelo.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.126
What the hell?

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.807
Shit.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.601
Where's Tina?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.570
Shit! Fuck!

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.801
Where is she?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.001
Oh, God!

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.161
Where's my sister?

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.766
Stop! Stop!

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.921
She's fine. She's fine.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.286
Where is she?

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.967
Shit!

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.045
Stop! Oh, God!

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.165
- She's with my aunt.
- Where?

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.526
- Okay, stop, stop.
- Where?

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.211
3221 San Tempest.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.049
All right, come on, man, stop!

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.091
What the fuck, Bo?

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.121
Oh, gosh!

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.850
Please, leave, man.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.285
I told you where she is. She's fine.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.128
Oh, come on! Look, we're good,
all right? We're good.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.611
Just... Just leave, all right?

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.721
Oh, shit!

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.970
$15,000.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.721
One kilo.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.241
What I actually owe you.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.767
Oh, gosh.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.041
Oh, shit.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.770
Hey, are you okay?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.369
- Where's Tina?
- We gotta go, she's close! Come on!

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.728
Okay, okay.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.041
Thank you.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.406
Hey. Wanna go?

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.720
Oh! Hey. Absolutely.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.891
Thank you, guys.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.127
T, go start your homework. Bo and I
are going to start dinner, okay?

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.201
Okay.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.084
I had my test today.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.326
Oh, yeah, I forgot to ask.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.851
I got a B.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.206
B's not bad.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.129
Did you hear from Georgi?

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.486
Yeah, she should be here this weekend.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.721
Sweet.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.166
What'd you do today?

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.526
Just working on that new trick.

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.482
Are you ever gonna show me?

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.767
When it's ready.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.921
It's gonna be something special.

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.327
Bo.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.006
Oh, my God!
