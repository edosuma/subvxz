TEMPTATIONS AND FACE MORE

00:19.253 --> 00:23.691
CONSEQUENCES THAN ANYONE IN THE
HISTORY OF THIS GAME, AND THESE

00:23.724 --> 00:26.594
CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES WILL
CAPTURE IT ALL.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.863
HOW THEY HANDLE THE TWISTS AND
TURNS WILL DETERMINE WHO WILL BE

00:29.897 --> 00:36.137
EVICTED AND WHO WILL BE THE LAST
PERSON STANDING.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.471
SO, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO WIN IT
ALL?

00:37.505 --> 00:41.109
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND

00:41.142 --> 00:49.049

WILL ONE HOUSEGUEST CLAIM
$25,000, THE LARGEST CASH PRIZE

01:21.482 --> 01:24.285
EVER AWARDED ON PREMIERE NIGHT?

01:24.318 --> 01:28.556
WILL A FORMER FAN FAVORITE GET

01:28.589 --> 01:31.925

GROUP OF HOUSEGUESTS GIVE IN TO

01:35.829 --> 01:38.732
TEMPTATION.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.935

PEOPLE THINK THAT IF I JUST DO
CROSSFIT I'M A TOTAL MEATHEAD,

02:22.943 --> 02:24.245
BUT I HAVE A LOT GOING ON.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.348
I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR... MOST OF
OUR BUSINESS COMES FROM THE

PIT CREW MEMBER.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.858
AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA, I HAVE OVER
1 MILLION FANS.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.494

03:01.949 --> 03:05.953
AS AN AUCTIONEER, I HAVE TO BE
ABLE TO READ THE CROWD

03:05.986 --> 03:07.888

BEING AWAY FROM MY FAMILY,
ESPECIALLY MY SON, IT'S GOING TO

03:17.465 --> 03:18.732
BE A HUGE SACRIFICE.

03:18.766 --> 03:23.637
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP THE END GOAL

I LIKE TO PLAY WITH A KNIFE.

03:39.753 --> 03:43.991

I'VE BEEN MARRIED 31 YEARS.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.212
IT'S A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE NOW
THAN IT WAS BACK THEN.

CONTROLLED CHAOS.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.125
THIS IS THE BULL'S EYE COMING.

04:52.159 --> 04:55.128
IT'S THE BEST PART OF LIFE BEING

05:05.573 --> 05:07.641
YOU DO NOT DISCLOSE THAT
INFORMATION.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.511
YOU HAVE TO BE TOUGH, ESPECIALLY
AS AN ENGINEER.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.180
A WOMAN ENGINEER, AN ENGINEER OF
COLOR.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.484
I'VE NAVIGATED D.C., SO BEING IN
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE IS GOING

05:16.517 --> 05:19.653
TO BE AH, A PIECE OF CAKE.

05:19.687 --> 05:23.457
SO SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, OR MAYBE
NOT, RELIGION IS EXTREMELY

05:23.491 --> 05:25.025
IMPORTANT TO ME.

I AM 100% UNFILTERED, AND THAT'S
A DANGEROUS THING TO BE IN THE

15:38.638 --> 15:39.839
BUSINESS, BABY.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.741
THEY'RE GOING TO UNDERESTIMATE
ME BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THAT

WRANGLE A BUNCH OF ANIMALS

I WANT.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.811
GO GET IT!

16:18.845 --> 16:19.646
GO ON!

16:19.679 --> 16:22.082
BUT I'M NOT A STEREOTYPAL DOG
WALKER.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.118
WHEN I WAS 20, I WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING INTERESTING AND FUN

16:25.152 --> 16:27.487
WITH MY LIFE, SO I JOINED THE
MILITARY.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.491
I ENDED UP GOING TO THE MIDDLE
EAST, AND TRAINING TO BECOMEAB

16:31.524 --> 16:32.725

TAWPT TO LIE, MANIPULATE, AND TO

16:36.063 --> 16:38.265
GET INTO PEOPLE'S HEADS.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.833
SO I THINK I'LL HAVE THINGS
HANDLED IN THE "BIG BROTHER"

I'LL DEFINITELY USE MY LOOKS TO
GET AHEAD IN THE GAME.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.061
I'M READY TO BRING IT.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.231
NOBODY IS GOING TO EXPECT ME TO
BE A SUPER FAN, BUT I HAVE BEEN

17:44.264 --> 17:45.632
WATCHING "BIG BROTHER" SINCE I
WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.800
IT WAS MY QUALITY TIME WITH MY
DAD.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.602
HE PASSED AWAY THREE YEARS AGO.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.139
I'M GOING TO WIN THIS, AND I

POSSIBLY EVEN LOYAL TO A FAULT.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.822
AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT DOES NOT COME BACK AND HURT

18:09.856 --> 18:12.259

18:21.301 --> 18:23.770
I'M GOING TO USE THIS GRAY HAIR
AS A WEAPON.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.639
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO THINK I'M
OLD AND UNDERESTIMATE ME, AND BY

18:26.673 --> 18:29.176
THE TIME THEY REALIZE I'M YOUNG
AND ATHLETIC, IT'S GOING TO BE

TO MAKE THEM WANT IT, WHICH IS

18:41.488 --> 18:42.088
THE BIG "W."

18:42.121 --> 18:43.523
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS PLACE.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.892

29:10.716 --> 29:12.218
>> OH, MY GOD.

29:12.251 --> 29:16.355
>.>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE KIDS
THESE DAYS.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.389
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER, WE ALL
PLAYED SPORTS TOGETHER, GET SOME

29:17.423 --> 29:18.224
SUN.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.691
KIDS NOW HAVE TO STOP DOING THE
GAMES.

29:19.725 --> 29:20.326
YOU WANT TO BE HEALTHY WHEN YOU
GET OLDER.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.028
>> I'M MATT.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.729
DESPITE LOOKING LIKE I'M 50 I'LL
ONLY 33 WITH ALL THE GRAY HAIR,

29:23.762 --> 29:24.730
OKAY.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.300
>> AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THE
SALT AND PEPPER.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.136
>> KNOW, RIGHT.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.370
IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

29:31.403 --> 29:34.841
>> LORD, YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER
LEAD ME INTO TEMPTATION BUT THEN

29:34.874 --> 29:42.214
I LOOK OVER AND I SEE MATT AND
I'M LIKE OH!

29:42.248 --> 29:44.516
>> I COULD GET DOWN WITH A
LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER.

29:44.550 --> 29:51.423
>> MATT IS, LIKE, FINER THAN
FROG HAIRS SPLIT THREE WAYS.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.158
>> I'M MARK.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.425

29:58.697 --> 30:02.168
>> YOU WANT THE WEIGHTS, I GOT
YOU.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.035
>> ALL OF US ARE GOING TO BE
BOOM!

30:03.069 --> 30:03.702
>> ONE MORE TIME.

30:03.735 --> 30:07.539
ONE MORE TIME.

30:07.573 --> 30:12.178
>> YO, CHEERS, GIEPS WE GOT A

>> WE'RE TOASTING CHAMPAGNE,
CHEWING THE FAT, CHUMMING IT UP.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.654
BUT COME ON, THIS IS "BIG
BROTHER."

30:22.688 --> 30:27.093
WAIT UNTIL THEY GET A LITTLE
DIRT KICKED ON THEM.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.360
>> Julie: SO, "BIG BROTHER'S"
SUMMER OF TEMPTATION IS

30:28.394 --> 30:29.595
UNDERWAY.

30:29.628 --> 30:32.764
AND BEFORE THE NIGHT IS UP, THE
HOUSEGUESTS WILL BE TEMPTED BY

30:32.798 --> 30:35.267
MONEY, SAFETY, AND POWER.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.336
BUT IT WILL ALL COME AT A COST.

30:37.369 --> 30:44.076
THE FIRST TEMPTATION DROPS NEXT.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.244
STAY WITH US.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.387
IT'S YOU!

31:28.420 --> 31:29.855

31:56.148 --> 32:02.188
>> Julie: WELL, GET READY
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE

32:02.221 --> 32:03.655
BIGGEST, WILDEST, MOST-TEMPTING
SUMMER IN THE HISTORY OF THE

32:03.689 --> 32:06.825
GAME.

32:06.858 --> 32:12.198
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER'S SUMMER

32:12.231 --> 32:15.167
( CHEERS )
YOU'RE CELEBRATING, AND YOU

32:15.201 --> 32:18.204
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

32:18.237 --> 32:23.642
>> THIS IS OUR LAST MOMENT TO BE
HAPPY!

32:23.675 --> 32:32.751
>> Julie: BUT I WILL TELL YOU
THIS: IT ALL STARTS RIGHT NOW.

32:32.784 --> 32:42.061
TONIGHT, YOU WILL BE TEMPTED BY
MONEY, SAFETY, AND POWER.

32:42.094 --> 32:46.665
AND HOW THE NIGHT PLAYS OUT WILL
DEPEND ON HOW YOU DEAL WITH

32:46.698 --> 32:49.501
THESE TEMPTATIONS.

32:49.535 --> 32:53.772
>> OH, MY GOSH!

32:53.805 --> 32:54.873
JAIL!

32:54.906 --> 32:56.008
>> Julie: ARE YOU ALL READY FOR
YOUR FIRST TEMPTATION?

32:56.042 --> 33:01.347
>> NO.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.414
>> I'M TEMPTED BY LADYS.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.283
I'M TEMPTED BY MONEY.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.085
I'M TEMPTED BY EVERYTHING.

33:06.118 --> 33:06.885
TEMPT ME, JULIE!

33:06.918 --> 33:14.193
>> Julie: THEN PLEASE HEAD

>> Julie: WELCOME TO "BIG
BROTHER'S "GARDEN OF

33:22.868 --> 33:24.903
TEMPTATION."

33:24.936 --> 33:27.173
I NEED EVERYONE TO PICK A POD.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.775
>> I'M GOING UP IN THIS PEANUT
SHELL.

33:29.808 --> 33:33.112
I'M IN A THREE-PIECE SUIT.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.613
I'M THINKING WHAT AM I DOING?

33:34.646 --> 33:36.682
THE PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD IN MISSION HILL

33:36.715 --> 33:40.886
WOULD BE LIKE, "WHAT IS GOING
ON?"

33:40.919 --> 33:44.923
>> Julie: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR
EVERYONE.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.826
"WHO COULD USE $25,000?"
WELL, THIS TEMPTATION IS VERY

33:47.859 --> 33:49.095
SIMPLE.

33:49.128 --> 33:52.498
>> OH, MAN!

33:52.531 --> 33:54.600
>> Julie: EACH OF YOU HAS A
BUTTON IN YOUR HAND.

33:54.633 --> 33:58.404
WHEN THE LIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
TURNS GREEN, BE THE FIRST PERSON

33:58.437 --> 34:02.474
TO PUSH YOUR BUTTON, AND YOU
WILL WIN $25,000.

34:02.508 --> 34:03.542
>> WHAT!

34:03.575 --> 34:04.910
>> WHAT'S THE CATCH?

34:04.943 --> 34:08.214
>> BECAUSE THERE IS A CATCH.

34:08.247 --> 34:14.153
>> Julie: BUT BE WARNED: TAKING
THIS TEMPTATION WILL HAVE ITS

34:14.186 --> 34:16.788
CONSEQUENCES.

34:16.822 --> 34:20.126
ACCEPT IT, AND THE FIRST TWIST
OF THE SUMMER WILL BE RELEASED

34:20.159 --> 34:25.764
INTO THE GAME.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.065
THAT'S RIGHT.

34:27.099 --> 34:30.836
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN "BIG
BROTHER "HISTORY, WHETHER OR NOT

34:30.869 --> 34:32.504
THE FIRST BIG TWIST OF THE
SUMMER IS UNLEASHED WILL BE

34:32.538 --> 34:37.743
ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

34:37.776 --> 34:40.512
NOW, THE PERSON WHO TAKES THIS
TEMPTATION WILL REMAIN

34:40.546 --> 34:42.614
ANONYMOUS.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.883
IS EVERYONE READY TO BEGIN?

34:44.916 --> 34:45.717
>> YES.

34:45.751 --> 34:46.918
>> YES "N."

34:46.952 --> 34:48.154
>> YES!

34:48.187 --> 34:51.790
>> AS A SUPER FAN, I KNOW TWISTS
CAN RUIN ANYBODY'S GAME AT ANY

34:51.823 --> 34:55.761
TIME, SO I'M NOT PRESSING THAT
BUTTON EVEN IF IT'S FOR $25,000.

34:55.794 --> 34:59.998
>> OF COURSE, I WANT TO PRESS
THE BUTTON.

35:00.031 --> 35:04.436
25K IS TEMPTING, BUT I'M HERE
FOR 25 "K," AND 25 "K," ONLY.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.239
>> WE JUST STARTED THE GAME.

35:07.273 --> 35:12.211
25 K IS NOT WORTH UNLEASHING A
CONGSQUENCE ON THE HOUSE.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.612
NOBODY BETTER PRESS THAT BUTTON.

35:13.645 --> 35:18.917
>> Julie: OKAY, HERE WE GO!

35:18.950 --> 35:31.430
( BELL RINGING )
>> Julie: AND THE TEMPTATION HAS

35:31.463 --> 35:34.833
BEEN ACCEPTED.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.101
ONE OF YOU HAS CLAIMED THE
$25,000.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.270
>> I'M SUPER PUMP THEY HAD ENDED
UP WINNING, BUT I CAN'T MAKE ANY

35:38.304 --> 35:38.937
FACES.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.038
I CAN'T SAY NOTHING.

35:40.071 --> 35:43.475
I DON'T WANT TO DO THE FIST
PUMP.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.811
I MADE THEM THINK THE HEAT WAS
TOO MUCH FOR ME.

35:45.844 --> 35:49.481
STRATEGY IS WHAT "BIG BROTHER"
SAUL ABOUT.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.749
>> Julie: THAT MEANS THE FIRST
TWIST HAS BEEN UNLEASHED INTO

35:50.782 --> 35:51.850
THE GAME.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.986
BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS
TWIST COMES WITH TWO

35:55.020 --> 36:00.259
CONSEQUENCES -- ONE PERSONAL,
AND ONE FOR THE ENTIRE HOUSE

36:00.292 --> 36:00.892
>> WHAT!

36:00.926 --> 36:04.263
>> OOERKS!

36:04.296 --> 36:08.200
>> Julie: THE PERSONAL
CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE PERSON

36:08.234 --> 36:10.802
WHO CLAIMED THE $25,000 IS NOT
ELIGIBLE TO WIN THE FIRST HEAD

36:10.836 --> 36:13.972
OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.175
>> I KNEW IT.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.311
>> Julie: HE OR SHE WILL HAVE TO
THROW IT.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.680
>> OH, WOW.

36:21.713 --> 36:24.250
>> Julie: THE SECOND CONSEQUENCE
THAT AFFECTS ALL OF YOU WILL BE

36:24.283 --> 36:26.752
REVEALED IN DUE TIME.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.687
>> OH, JULIE!

36:28.720 --> 36:30.589
>> SOMEONE HIT THAT BUTTON.

36:30.622 --> 36:36.828
THEY GRABBED THAT 25 "K,"
UNDERSTAND, WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU

36:36.862 --> 36:41.166
JUST CHANGED THE GAME, AND I'M
COMING FOR YOU.

36:41.199 --> 36:45.937
>> Julie: SO, KEVIN HAS TAKEN
THE FIRST TEMPTATION OF THE

36:45.971 --> 36:47.172
SUMMER.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.108
IN DOING SO, HE HAS UNLEASH AID
GAME-CHANGING TWIST, AND THEY

36:50.141 --> 36:57.449
HAVE NO IDEA BUT THEY'RE ABOUT
TO BE JOINED BY A 17th

36:57.483 --> 36:58.884
HOUSEMATE WHO HAPPENS TO BE A
FORMER FAN FAVORITE.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.387
AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.488
STAY WITH US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

37:16.902 --> 37:18.670
>> I DON'T KNOW.

37:18.704 --> 37:19.905
>> WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.441
>> I DIDN'T HIT IT.

37:22.474 --> 37:27.613
>> WHEN CAM STARTS TALKING HE
SOUNDS PRETTY FREAKING SKETCHY,

37:27.646 --> 37:28.447
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I REALLY
BELIEVE THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE

37:28.480 --> 37:28.980
MONEY.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.248
>> I WANT THE SAFETY.

37:30.282 --> 37:33.985
>> I KNEW THAT 25,000 BUCKS, NO
MATTER WHAT THEY COULD DO TO YOU

37:34.019 --> 37:34.786
INDIVIDUALLY--
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

37:34.820 --> 37:39.691
>> THAT'S, LIKE, THIRD PLACE.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.693
>> FOR 25,000 BUCKS.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.729
DAMN WOMEN AND THEIR CAT-LIKE
REFLEXES.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.164
>> SOMEBODY PRESSES THE BUTTON.

37:46.197 --> 37:49.468
I AM NOT EVEN REMOTELY
SURPRISED.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.337
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TWIST
RELEASED UPON THE HOUSE, AND I'M

37:51.370 --> 37:52.103
FREAKING OUT A LITTLE BIT.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.340
>> I KNOW ONE OF YOU GIRLS GOT
IT.

37:54.373 --> 37:57.976
WHAT IN SAM HILL DOES "BIG
BROTHER" HAVE IN STORE FOR US

37:58.009 --> 37:58.444
NOW?

37:58.477 --> 37:59.711
>>
( DOORBELL

37:59.745 --> 38:00.111
(.

38:00.145 --> 38:01.913
>> OH, MY GOD!

38:01.947 --> 38:02.814
>> WHAT!

38:02.848 --> 38:04.182
>> ANSWER IT!

38:04.215 --> 38:04.683
ANSWER IT!

38:04.716 --> 38:08.754

>> OH, MY GOD!

38:13.659 --> 38:17.463
>> WHAT'S UP!

38:17.496 --> 38:18.564
WOOOO!

38:18.597 --> 38:21.467
WHICH ONE OF YOU BIT THE APPLE
AND GOT THE SNAKE, BABY?

38:21.500 --> 38:22.100
WHO WAS IT?

38:22.133 --> 38:28.239
WHO NEEDED 25 Gs THAT BAD?

38:28.273 --> 38:34.580
>> PAUL FROM SEASON 18 JUST
WALKED IN, AND I AM FREAKING

38:34.613 --> 38:35.280
OUT.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.548
HE HAD SUCH A GREAT SOCIAL GAME.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.884
>> I HAVE A FACT TO TELL YOU,
MAN!

38:38.917 --> 38:41.420
>> HE HAD THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF
FRIENDSHIP IN THE HOUSE.

38:41.453 --> 38:45.256
>> BECAUSE THIS HOUSE GETS A
LITTLE STIR-CRAZY I STARTED MY

38:45.290 --> 38:46.425
ONLY LITTLE TALK SHOW CALLED,
"FRIENDSHIP TIME WITH PAUL."

38:46.458 --> 38:49.361
WHAT IS THE FASTEST WAY TO YOUR
HEART?

38:49.395 --> 38:52.163
>> IT WOULD BE DAISY DUKES AND
BOOTS.

38:52.197 --> 38:54.099
>> AND HE MADE TO FINAL TWO.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.334
>.>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
NICOLE.

38:56.368 --> 39:00.406
YOU ARE THE WINNER OF "BIG
BROTHER."

39:00.439 --> 39:00.906
>> WHAT'S UP, PAUL?

39:00.939 --> 39:01.907
>> WHAT'S UP, DUDE.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.610
>> PAUL WALKS IN AND I'M SUPER
EXCITED.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.911
HE'S A BIGGER THREAT THAN ME.

39:05.944 --> 39:06.678
HE'S LOUD.

39:06.712 --> 39:07.746
HE'S OBNOXIOUS.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.682
>> OH, WE GOT SOME MORE TATTOOS.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.149
WHAT'S UP?

39:11.182 --> 39:12.584
>> NEEZ YOUR FACE.

39:12.618 --> 39:15.987
ALL THINGS THAT ARE GREAT FOR ME
TO KEEP MY THREAT LEVEL LOW.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.623
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

39:17.656 --> 39:18.390
ARE YOU PLAYING?

39:18.424 --> 39:20.559
>> YEAH, I'M NOT JUST HANGING
OUT.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.894
>> PAUL ENTERS THE HOUSE.

39:22.928 --> 39:23.929
NOW THERE ARE 17 HORSES.

39:23.962 --> 39:27.399
I LOOK AT THE TABLE, 16 SADDLES.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.767
SOMEBODY'S GETTING BUCKED OFF.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.569
WHATEVER IS COMING, THIS IS NOT
GOING TO BE GOOD.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.003
>> DOMINIQUE, HI.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.204
>> VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

39:33.238 --> 39:38.977
>> I WAS HOPING WE WERE NOT GET
GOG HAVE ANY REAPPEARANCES.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.947
BUT THEN AGAIN, WHO AM I TO NOT
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED?

39:41.980 --> 39:45.316
>> THAT JUST MADE THE GAME SO
MUCH HARDER.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.284
>> WOW, THIS IS SO CRAZY.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.886
>> IT'S SO COOL, RIGHT?

39:47.919 --> 39:52.157
>> I DON'T LIKE THIS GUY.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.125
I DON'T THINK HE'S TRUSTWORTHY
AT ALL.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.062
I'M PRETEND I CAN WORK WITH HIM
BUT I REALLY CAN'T.

39:57.095 --> 40:00.065
THE SECOND I GET A CHANCE TO
BACKDOOR HIM, I WILL.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.166
>> PAUL, WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

40:01.199 --> 40:02.634
>> I'M FROM L.A., BUD.

40:02.668 --> 40:03.134
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

40:03.168 --> 40:04.035
>> BOSTON.

40:04.069 --> 40:07.539
>> I SEE-- I SEE MY SLICKED-BACK
COOL GUY.

40:07.573 --> 40:08.940
I SEE YOU, BROTHER.

40:08.974 --> 40:09.841
I SEE YOU.

40:09.875 --> 40:10.809
>> I'M LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA WHO
THIS GUY IS.

40:10.842 --> 40:14.045
I'M LIKE IS IT JUST ANOTHER
COMPETITOR?

40:14.079 --> 40:17.015
YOU HAVE TO GIVE SOMEONE THE
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND I SEE

40:17.048 --> 40:18.550
EVERYONE BEING NICE TO HIM.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.685
HE LOOKS LIKE A REALLY GOOD KID.

40:19.718 --> 40:22.654
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M
ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST FANS.

40:22.688 --> 40:25.924
>> THAT'S SO SWEET JIERVETION
ROOTING FOR YOU.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.660
>> WHAT'S UP, AMERICA.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.328
YOUR BOY IS BACK IN THE HOUSE.

40:30.361 --> 40:32.363
AND LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY IN THE
HOUSE WANTS TO GET FRIENDSHIP

40:32.397 --> 40:33.231
WITH HIM.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.432
GUESS WHAT?

40:34.466 --> 40:36.602
I WAS A NEWBIE LAST YEAR, AND
THE MINUTE I SAW THOSE VETS I

40:36.635 --> 40:37.769
WANTED THEM OUT.

40:37.803 --> 40:42.007
YOUR BOY HAS TO PUT HIS BRAINS
TO USE HERE SO I CAN GET OFF

40:42.040 --> 40:43.208
EVERYBODY'S RADAR.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.109
SORRY, GUYS.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.911
I'LL FRIENDSHIP IN A MOMENT.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.380
I'M ABOUT TO THROW UP FROM
ANXIETY, AND THIS IS SO WEIRD.

40:49.414 --> 40:52.551
>> HAVE YOU BEEN UP HERE YET?

40:52.584 --> 40:54.352
YEAH, YOU HAVE, RIGHT?

40:54.385 --> 40:57.222
FOR A SECOND.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.224
>> SWEET.

40:59.257 --> 41:02.761
THE OTHER PERSON I WANTED UP
HERE IS COMING UP.

41:02.794 --> 41:03.361
RAMSES.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.498
>> WHAT'S UP, GUY YOOZ S.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.099
>> I WAS HOPING YOU GUYS WOULD
COME UP.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.400
>> WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

41:09.434 --> 41:13.338
>> HONESTLY, THE FOUR OF US,
WE'RE KIND OF THE ODDBECAUSE.

41:13.371 --> 41:16.074
I FEEL A GOOD VIBE TOWARDS YOU,
TOO.

41:16.107 --> 41:23.281
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK OF PAUL
BEING HERE.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.249
>> HE'S REALLY BAD.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.251
>> SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M
THINKING.

41:26.284 --> 41:29.087
>> PAUL BEING IN THE HOUSE IS A
REALLY BAD THING FOR MY GAME.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.857
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S VETERANS
MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.793
SO, PAUL YIEWRK NOT GOING TO
LAST VERY LONG.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.094
>> HE'S RUTHLESS.

41:36.127 --> 41:36.928
HE WANTS TO WIN THIS TIME.

41:36.962 --> 41:39.497
>> HE'S LOYAL, THOUGH, TO HIS
PEOPLE.

41:39.531 --> 41:42.601
>> DO YOU THINK HE'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO THINK OF US AS "HIS

41:42.634 --> 41:43.902
PEOPLE?"
>> MAYBE NOT.

41:43.935 --> 41:49.608
>> I LOVE THIS LITTLE GROUP OF
ODDBECAUSE.

41:49.641 --> 41:52.678
THESE THREE PEOPLE, THEY SEEM
LIKE MY KIND OF PEOPLE, REALLY

41:52.711 --> 41:53.812
DOWN TO EARTH.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.783
AND I GET THE FEELING IN THE
VIBE THEY CAN KIND OF TRUST

41:57.816 --> 41:58.617
THEM.

41:58.650 --> 42:01.186
>> LET'S NOT CONSIDER AN
ALLIANCE NOW.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.521
LET'S CONSIDER IT A GROUP OF
PEOPLE CONSIDERING STRATEGY.

42:03.555 --> 42:04.590
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

42:04.623 --> 42:04.990
>> RIGHT.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.727
>> YEAH.

42:08.760 --> 42:17.869
>> I LOVE PEANUT BUT OR MY
WAFFLES AND PANPAIKS.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.104
>> Julie: HOUSEGUESTS, PLEASE
MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE LIVING ROOM

42:19.137 --> 42:20.338
RIGHT NOW.

42:20.371 --> 42:25.043
>> I'M USED TO THIS CHAIR!

42:25.076 --> 42:25.811
>> Julie: HI, PAUL.

42:25.844 --> 42:27.512
>> HI, JULIE!

42:27.545 --> 42:28.013
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.717
>> GOOD TO BE HERE!

42:31.750 --> 42:34.653
>> Julie: WELL, YOU'VE ALL HAD A
LITTLE TIME TO GET TO KNOW PAUL,

42:34.686 --> 42:36.354
AND I CAN CONFIRM THAT HE IS,
INDEED, BACK IN THE GAME,

42:36.387 --> 42:39.825
COMPETING FOR THE HALF-MILLION
DOLLAR GRAND PRIZE, JUST LIKE

42:39.858 --> 42:42.027
ALL OF YOU.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.896
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GUYS ARE
CLAPPING?

42:44.930 --> 42:45.897
>> I KNOW, RIGHT.

42:45.931 --> 42:50.501
>> IT'S ONE MORE COMPETITOR THAT
KNOWS THE GAME.

42:50.535 --> 42:52.904
>> Julie: NOW, THE ONLY THING
PAUL KNEW ABOUT THIS SEASON WAS

42:52.938 --> 42:55.106
THAT IF SOMEONE TOOK THE FIRST
TEMPTATION, HE WOULD BE BACK IN

42:55.140 --> 43:01.246
THE GAME.

43:01.279 --> 43:02.714
BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT.

43:02.748 --> 43:05.884
>> OH!

43:05.917 --> 43:07.853
>> Julie: THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE TO PLAY THE GAME.

43:07.886 --> 43:09.287
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME!

43:09.320 --> 43:10.756
>> Julie: PAUL IS ACTUALLY
TAKING ONE OF YOUR PLACES IN THE

43:10.789 --> 43:12.123
GAME.

43:12.157 --> 43:15.126
>> OH, MY GOD!

43:15.160 --> 43:16.695
>> Julie: THAT'S RIGHT,
HOUSEGUESTS.

43:16.728 --> 43:21.800
THIS IS THE FIRST-EVER "BIG
BROTHER" SWAP.

43:21.833 --> 43:23.702
THAT MEANS ONE OF YOU WILL BE
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"

43:23.735 --> 43:26.337
HOUSE TONIGHT.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.547
>> I'M NOT HAPPY.

43:36.581 --> 43:39.785
LESS THAN 12 HOURS ALREADY, AND
SOMEONE'S GOING HOME.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.253
COWBOY INTUITION TOLD ME IT WAS
HAPPENING, BUT THIS SUCTION.

43:42.287 --> 43:43.421
>> JULIE TELLS US THAT SOMEONE
IS GOING HOME TONIGHT AND I'M

43:43.454 --> 43:44.555
NOT READY FOR THAT.

43:44.589 --> 43:50.929
I HAVE TONS OF THINGS ON MY
BUCKET LIST LIKE WIN H.O.H.,

43:50.962 --> 43:52.630
OTEV, HAVE ZINGBOT ZING ME.

43:52.664 --> 43:55.533
I'M NOT GOING HOME ON NIGHT ONE.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.302
>> Julie: AND THIS LEADS ME TO
THE SECOND TEMPTATION OF THE

43:57.335 --> 44:01.372
NIGHT: SAFETY.

44:01.406 --> 44:09.080
IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE GAME,
YOU WILL NEED TO TEMPT PAUL.

44:09.114 --> 44:12.217
AS YOU KNOW, LAST SUMMER, PAUL
WAS ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, AND

44:12.250 --> 44:16.822
THAT IS MORE TRUE TONIGHT THAN
EVER BEFORE.

44:16.855 --> 44:20.191
PAUL, PLEASE HEAD TO THE STORAGE
ROOM AND RETRIEVE THE BOX, BUT

44:20.225 --> 44:24.996
DO NOT OPEN IT UNTIL I TELL YOU.

44:25.030 --> 44:30.068
>> OH, I'M THROWING UP
SOMEWHERE.

44:30.101 --> 44:34.405
>> I ENDED UP WINNING THE MONEY
AND I DON'T FEEL BAD I WON THE

44:34.439 --> 44:36.274
MONEY BUT THERE'S A TWIST ON THE
HOUSE.

44:36.307 --> 44:38.777
AND ALL IS IN HERE AND SOMEONE
IS GOING HOME AND I START TO

44:38.810 --> 44:39.610
FEEL BAD.

44:39.644 --> 44:42.180
>> HERE.

44:42.213 --> 44:46.084
>> Julie: OKAY, PAUL, GO
AHEAD.

44:46.117 --> 44:47.152
OPEN THE BOX.

44:47.185 --> 44:48.619
>> WHAT'S IN THE BOX!

44:48.653 --> 44:55.660
ALL RIGHT.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.029
>> WHOA!

44:58.063 --> 44:58.864
THAT'S SKETCH!

44:58.897 --> 45:01.032
I HAVE A BUNCH OF FRIENDSHIP
BRACELETS.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.068
>> OH, MY GOD!

45:03.101 --> 45:06.905
>> Julie: THERE ARE NINE
FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS INSIDE.

45:06.938 --> 45:07.839
>> OH, MY GOD.

45:07.873 --> 45:10.408
>> WHOA!

45:10.441 --> 45:11.642
>> Julie: ONE IS FOR YOU, PAUL.

45:11.676 --> 45:15.046
THE OTHER EIGHT BRACELETS YOU
WILL BE HANDING OUT TO THE EIGHT

45:15.080 --> 45:17.648
HOUSEGUESTS OF YOUR CHOICE.

45:17.682 --> 45:21.186
>> OH, GOD!

45:21.219 --> 45:22.453
>> Julie: AND ANY HOUSEGUEST WHO
RECEIVES A FRIENDSHIP BRACELET

45:22.487 --> 45:29.727
WILL BE SAFE FROM TONIGHT'S
EVICTION.

45:29.761 --> 45:32.764
TO BE CLEAR, PAUL WILL KEEP
HIMSELF AND EIGHT OF YOU SAFE,

45:32.798 --> 45:34.065
LEAVING THE OTHER EIGHT OF YOU
IN JEOPARDY OF GOING HOME

45:34.099 --> 45:38.469
TONIGHT.

45:38.503 --> 45:41.539
SO, HOUSEGUESTS, YOU HAVE ONE
MISSION.

45:41.572 --> 45:44.843
IF YOU WANT TO AVOID EVICTION,
YOU NEED TO TEMPT PAUL INTO

45:44.876 --> 45:51.082
KEEPING YOU SAFE.

45:51.116 --> 45:53.785
>> I ALREADY HAD A MASSIVE
TARGET ON MY BACK.

45:53.819 --> 45:57.422
AND NOW WITH THIS FRIENDSHIP
POWER IT'S EVEN BIGGER.

45:57.455 --> 46:00.425
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LIE--
HAVING ALL THESE ROOKIES COME UP

46:00.458 --> 46:04.963
TO ME AND TEMPT ME RIGHT OFF THE
BAT, I COULD GET USED TO THIS

46:04.996 --> 46:07.198
LIFESTYLE.

46:07.232 --> 46:09.901
>> Julie: WELL, PAUL, I WILL
BE BACK LATER FOR YOUR DECISION.

46:09.935 --> 46:12.370
>> NOW ONE OF US IS GOING TO BE
EVICTED TONIGHT.

46:12.403 --> 46:17.408
>> OH, MY GOD.

46:17.442 --> 46:19.310
>> THIS IS A TWISTED TWIST.

46:19.344 --> 46:23.648
I JUST GOT HERE AND DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO TAKE MY WEAVE OUT NEXT SO

46:23.681 --> 46:26.117
I NEED ONE OF THOSE BRACELETS.

46:26.151 --> 46:26.617
THIEWLS I CAN SAY.

46:26.651 --> 46:30.021
>> I'M SORRY, GUYS.

46:30.055 --> 46:32.357
>> Julie: UP NEXT, WHO WILL PAUL
KEEP SAFE?

46:32.390 --> 46:36.094
WHO'S GAME WILL BE PUT IN
JEOPARDY?

46:36.127 --> 46:38.596
AND WHO WILL BE GOING HOME
BEFORE THE GAME HAS BARELY EVEN

46:38.629 --> 46:40.899
BEGUN?

46:40.932 --> 46:44.502
AND LATER, LEARN HOW YOU,
AMERICA, WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE

46:44.535 --> 46:46.571
IN TEMPTING THE HOUSEGUESTS.

46:46.604 --> 46:48.039
STAY WITH US.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

47:04.122 --> 47:06.757
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO THE
"BIG BROTHER" TWO-NIGHT PREMIERE

47:06.791 --> 47:08.593
EVENT.

47:08.626 --> 47:11.162
"THE SUMMER OF TEMPTATION" IS
ALREADY IN FULL SWING, AS

47:11.196 --> 47:18.503
KEVIN TOOK $25,000,
AND IN DOING SO UNLEASHED THE

47:18.536 --> 47:22.073
FIRST TWIST, SENDING PAUL BACK
INTO THE GAME.

47:22.107 --> 47:27.412
AND HIS ARRIVAL IS ALL PART OF
THE "BIG BROTHER" SWAP, WHICH

47:27.445 --> 47:29.780
MEANS PAUL IS MOVING IN,AND ONE
OF THE OTHERS IS MOVING OUT.

47:29.814 --> 47:31.549
PAUL NOW HAS THE POWER TO KEEP
EIGHT HOUSEGUESTS SAFE BY GIVING

47:31.582 --> 47:36.454
THEM A BRACELET.

47:36.487 --> 47:39.824
SO, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO WIN HIM
OVER AND GET ONE OF THE COVETED

47:39.857 --> 47:45.630
BRACELETS?

47:45.663 --> 47:46.932
>> WE'RE GETTING COMFORTABLE.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.166
I LIKE THAT.

47:48.199 --> 47:51.269
JULIE TELLS EVERYONE THEY HAVE
TO TEMPT ME AND BRIBE ME TO GET

47:51.302 --> 47:54.005
ME TO GIVE THEM A FRIENDSHIP
BRACELET.

47:54.039 --> 47:55.706
WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO BE TEMPTED?

47:55.740 --> 48:05.984
FOR ONCE, YOUR BOY IS NOT THAT
PISSED.

48:06.017 --> 48:13.959
>> LOOK, CINDY, YOUR SWEET
LITTLE CHARLIE, YOUR LITTLE

48:13.992 --> 48:19.998
BUNNY ASS, IT'S NOT GOING TO
WORK.

48:20.031 --> 48:22.033
>> HERE, PINKY PROMISE.

48:22.067 --> 48:22.767
>> PINKY PROMISE.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.102
>> AND I'M GOING TO STAMP THAT.

48:24.135 --> 48:26.837
>> OKAY, MAYBE IT WORKED A
LITTLE BIT, BUT IT'S NOT GOING

48:26.871 --> 48:27.805
TO WORK THE WHOLE TIME.

48:27.838 --> 48:28.573
>> THIS IS MY BRIBE.

48:28.606 --> 48:30.741
IT IS A CHEESE SANDWICH.

48:30.775 --> 48:33.378
>> IS THERE BRIE IN THE MIDDLE?

48:33.411 --> 48:34.879
>> YEAH, I'M NOT A MONSTER.

48:34.912 --> 48:38.916
>> YOU CAN'T PROMISE ME SAFETY
AND LOYALTY BECAUSE YOU'RE

48:38.950 --> 48:39.284
LYING.

48:39.317 --> 48:39.684
IT'S DENSE.

48:39.717 --> 48:40.185
>> IT'S DENSE.

48:40.218 --> 48:41.086
>> IT'S VERY DENSE.

48:41.119 --> 48:42.320
>> IT'S GOOD CHEESE.

48:42.353 --> 48:43.588
>> IT'S GOOD CHEESE.

48:43.621 --> 48:48.960
>> GIVING ME A CHEESE SANDWICH,
THAT'S 100% FACT AND FRIENDSHIP.

48:48.994 --> 48:53.064
>> MAYBE NEXT I'M I'LL ADD A
CONTINENTIMENT.

48:53.098 --> 48:58.669
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, "PROMISE
SAFE SANDWICH."

48:58.703 --> 48:59.770
>> YOU WANT TO KNOW THE KEY TO

GIVE ME SOME BRIE.

49:01.172 --> 49:02.040

49:03.741 --> 49:05.977
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO WORK WITH
ME.

49:06.011 --> 49:07.345
>> LOYALTY IS WHAT TAKES YOU FAR
IN THIS GAME.

49:07.378 --> 49:10.248
>> I KNOW THAT, MAN, I HAVE BEEN
WATCHING THIS SHOW FOR YEARS.

49:10.281 --> 49:13.118

HUGE, HUGE FAN.

49:13.151 --> 49:14.385

49:17.588 --> 49:18.756
FRIENDSHIP IS BELTWAY.

49:18.789 --> 49:28.933
I CAN TELL YOU-- I HAVE TO WORK
ON THAT BECAUSE I'M SO LOUD.

49:28.966 --> 49:31.336
>> SO WHAT'S UP?

49:31.369 --> 49:33.338
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

49:33.371 --> 49:33.804
>> 27.

49:33.838 --> 49:35.773
>> 27.

49:35.806 --> 49:40.145
NICE.

49:40.178 --> 49:43.214
>> IT'S LIKE A ROMANTIC DINNER
GONE WRONG, AND I'M OVER HERE,

49:43.248 --> 49:44.349
I'M DRESSED UP NICE.

49:44.382 --> 49:47.052
I TOOK US OUT TO THE MOST
EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT IN TOWN.

49:47.085 --> 49:49.587
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO
TALK TO ME?

49:51.689 --> 49:52.690
>> NICE.

49:52.723 --> 49:55.660
>> THIS MIGHT BE THE WORST DATE
I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

49:55.693 --> 49:58.096
>> I JUST DID PUSHUPS.

49:58.129 --> 49:59.964
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE JACKED, DUDE,
I LOVE IT.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.467
>> PROMISE YOU ONE THING,
THOUGH, THE NEXT TIME I HAVE A

50:02.500 --> 50:07.672
CHANCE AT POWER, 100% SAFETY
>> AND TA-DA!

50:07.705 --> 50:10.075
>> CAN I CALL YOU MATTHEW
McCONAUGHEY?

50:10.108 --> 50:10.475

I CAN'T GO BACK THAT QUICK.

IF YOU COME AT ME AT AN 11, ONE
OF US IS GOING TO JAIL.

51:32.890 --> 51:35.926
IF YOU DIDN'T GET A BRACELET,
WOULD YOU STILL TRUST ME?

51:35.960 --> 51:38.129

52:01.686 --> 52:03.888
I'M SURE WE COULD DO GOOD
THINGS.

52:03.921 --> 52:04.689
>> HEY, DUDE, RESPECT.

52:04.722 --> 52:06.557

52:21.872 --> 52:25.142
"B," I HAVE TO MIX A FEW NERDS,
AND A FEW IN-BETWEENS.

52:25.176 --> 52:27.312
"C," I WANT TO SEE WHO WILL
CRACK.

52:27.345 --> 52:29.914
YOU PUT A LITTLE GARNISH, YOU
PUT A LITTLE SPICE, AND YOU MAKE

52:29.947 --> 52:31.115
THE FRIENDSHIP STEW.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.351
AND GUESS WHO'S STIRRING THE
POT.

52:33.384 --> 52:34.151

REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE YOU

I CAN'T GO HOME ON DAY ONE.

54:43.448 --> 54:48.586
IF HE DOESN'T PICK ME, I'M GOING
TO BE DEVASTATED.

SAFE.

55:49.714 --> 55:52.583
I AM SO NERVOUS.

55:52.617 --> 55:54.385
>> Julie: THERE ARE NINE
HOUSEGUESTS LEFT AND ONLY ONE

55:54.419 --> 55:56.687

55:56.721 --> 55:57.187
>> PAUL!

55:57.221 --> 55:58.756
WE HAD RAY MOMENT.

55:58.789 --> 56:01.592
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING.

56:01.626 --> 56:06.130
DON'T LEAVE A GIRL HANGING ON

56:23.280 --> 56:24.281
I TRUST PAUL.

56:24.314 --> 56:27.117
THE BEST THING HE DID WAS NOT
GIVE ME A BRACELET.

56:27.151 --> 56:27.718
WHY?

56:27.752 --> 56:28.719
BECAUSE IT DISCONNECTS US.

56:28.753 --> 56:29.487
I TRUST HIS WORD.

56:29.520 --> 56:32.457
>> AND KNOW IT'S GOING TO WORK
OUT.

YOURSELF.

56:59.517 --> 57:02.152
I NEED THE EIGHT OF YOU TO GO
GET DRESSED AND HEAD OUTSIDE.

57:02.186 --> 57:04.889

I'LL SEE EVERYONE IN THE
BACKYARD MOMENTARILY.

57:10.828 --> 57:13.430
>> I'M DEVASTATED.

57:13.464 --> 57:15.265
THIS IS THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

57:15.299 --> 57:21.005
BUT I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO
GOING OUTSIDE, FIGHTI FIGHTING F

57:21.038 --> 57:22.372

FRIENDSHIP BRACELET, KIND OF

57:25.676 --> 57:27.678

ABOUT THE GUY.

57:27.712 --> 57:29.146

ON HIS SEASON ALL HE DID WAS
SCHEMED HIS WAY ALL THE WAY TO

57:35.653 --> 57:36.854
>> DON'T BE NERVOUS.

57:36.887 --> 57:37.822
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

57:37.855 --> 57:38.856
WE HAVE TO STAY STRONG.

57:38.889 --> 57:40.525
>> WHAT THE HELL, PAUL.

57:40.558 --> 57:41.792
I DON'T LIKE YOU, ANYWAY.

57:41.826 --> 57:46.597

BRACELET.

>> Julie: HOUSEGUESTS, YOU ARE
MORE LIKELY TO GET A SAFE APPLE

1:01:35.092 --> 1:01:42.632
FROM A RED SNAKE THAN A YELLOW
SNAKE.

1:01:42.666 --> 1:01:47.004
>> GOING INTO THIS COMPETITION,
I'M NOT SAFE, SO FOR ME TO WIN

1:01:47.037 --> 1:01:48.172
THE COMPETITION, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S
VERY IMPORTANT.

1:01:48.205 --> 1:01:50.440
TO GO OUT ON THE FIRST DAY WOULD
SUCK.

1:01:50.474 --> 1:01:51.375
>> COME ON, GUYS.

1:01:51.408 --> 1:01:53.710
>> COME ON, CAMERON!

1:01:53.744 --> 1:01:57.414
>> THE TRAPEZE IS DEFINITELY
HARD TO HANG ON TO.

1:01:57.447 --> 1:01:59.516
IT'S-- IT'S MORE DIFFICULT THAN
I EXPECTED.

1:01:59.549 --> 1:02:01.786
THIS COMPETITION IS REALLY
PAINFUL.

1:02:01.819 --> 1:02:04.154
MY FEET ARE ABSOLUTELY DYING.

1:02:04.188 --> 1:02:08.158
I'M LITERALLY GOING FROM MY TOES
ALL THE WAY BACK TO MY HEEL JUST

1:02:08.192 --> 1:02:10.861
TRYING TO FIND COMFORTABLE
POSITIONS FOR MY FEET.

1:02:10.895 --> 1:02:13.530
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1:02:13.563 --> 1:02:17.301
>> THIS COMPETITION IS A LOT
HARDER THAN IT SEEMS.

1:02:17.334 --> 1:02:21.806
IT LOOKS EASY HOLDING ON A ROPE
AND STANDING ON A BALANCE BEAM.

1:02:21.839 --> 1:02:23.073
BUT IT'S NOT.

1:02:23.107 --> 1:02:26.676
IT'S YOUR HANDS, IT'S YOUR ARMS,
IT'S YOUR LEGS, IT'S YOUR CORE,

1:02:26.710 --> 1:02:27.711
AND EVERYTHING IS BURNING.

1:02:27.744 --> 1:02:29.246
THIS IS STARTING TO HURD.

1:02:29.279 --> 1:02:31.281
>> YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT.

1:02:31.315 --> 1:02:32.616
>> YOU GET FIRST PICK!

1:02:32.649 --> 1:02:37.521
>> AIRFARE FALL, I REMEMBERED
JULIE'S CLUE THAT YOU ARE MORE

1:02:37.554 --> 1:02:41.892
LIKELY TO GET A SAFE APPLE FROM
A RED SNAKE THAN A YELLOW SNAKE.

1:02:41.926 --> 1:02:43.560
SO I GO FOR THE RED SNAKE.

1:02:43.593 --> 1:02:47.932
>> YO, JULIE, CAN WE GET ANOTHER
CLUE?

1:02:47.965 --> 1:02:49.199
>> CORY IS JUST HAVING FUN NOW.

1:02:49.233 --> 1:02:50.067
>> YOU GOT IT.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:50.901
>> RELAX.

1:02:50.935 --> 1:02:52.036
>> GO, CHRISTMAS!

1:02:52.069 --> 1:02:52.970
GET IT, GIRL!

1:02:53.003 --> 1:02:56.706
>> IN REAL LIFE, I'M A CROSSFIT
SUPER STAR.

1:02:56.740 --> 1:02:57.574
BALANCE, GOT IT.

1:02:57.607 --> 1:02:58.342
CORE STABILITY?

1:02:58.375 --> 1:02:59.709
GOT IT.

1:02:59.743 --> 1:03:00.845
ROPES?

1:03:00.878 --> 1:03:02.746
LET ME CLIMB THEM BECAUSE I WANT
TO GO TO THE TOP OF "BIG

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:03.013
BROTHER."

1:03:03.047 --> 1:03:03.480
>> OH!

1:03:03.513 --> 1:03:04.548
>> COME ON, GUYS.

1:03:04.581 --> 1:03:06.383
YOU'RE FINE.

1:03:06.416 --> 1:03:09.553
YOU'RE FINE.

1:03:09.586 --> 1:03:10.420
YOU'RE FINE.

1:03:10.454 --> 1:03:11.321
YOU'RE GOOD.

1:03:11.355 --> 1:03:14.691
>> I AM SHAKING, MY WHOLE BODY
HEAD TO TOE.

1:03:14.724 --> 1:03:19.329
EVERY INCH IS JUST TREMBLING,
AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE

1:03:19.363 --> 1:03:20.230
ONE HELL OF A FIGHT.

1:03:20.264 --> 1:03:21.631
I AM NOT GOING TO BE JODI.

1:03:21.665 --> 1:03:24.501
I AM NOT GOING TO BE GLENN.

1:03:24.534 --> 1:03:28.873
I AM NOT GOING OUT NIGHT ONE.

1:03:28.906 --> 1:03:30.007
COME ON, JULIE.

1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:36.046
CLUE US.

1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:37.814
>> YOU GOT IT!

1:03:37.848 --> 1:03:47.091
YOU GOT IT!

1:03:47.124 --> 1:03:47.424
( APPLAUSE ).

1:03:47.457 --> 1:03:50.060
>> YEAH!

1:03:50.094 --> 1:03:52.029
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

1:03:52.062 --> 1:03:52.396
YEAH.

1:03:52.429 --> 1:03:54.331
YOU GOT IT!

1:03:54.364 --> 1:03:55.832
( BUZZER ).

1:03:55.866 --> 1:04:00.770
>> OH, THAT WAS A GOOD EFFORT AT
THE END THERE, MAY GO PAN

1:04:00.804 --> 1:04:07.811
GO AHEAD AND PICK AN APPLE.

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:08.545
ALL RIGHT.

1:04:08.578 --> 1:04:10.114
LISTEN UP, HOUSEGUESTS.

1:04:10.147 --> 1:04:15.819
ONE OF THE YELLOW APPLES IS
SAFE.

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:19.789
>> JULIE DROPS A HINT THAT ONE
OF THE YELLOW APPLES IS SAFE.

1:04:19.823 --> 1:04:20.557
BOOM!

1:04:20.590 --> 1:04:22.326
I KNOW THAT I GOT A 50-50
CHANCE.

1:04:22.359 --> 1:04:23.760
THIS IS MY CLUE.

1:04:23.793 --> 1:04:31.735
( BUZZER )
>> Julie: JOSH IS DOWN.

1:04:31.768 --> 1:04:34.204
ALL RIGHT, JOSH, GO AHEAD AND
PICK AN APPLE.

1:04:34.238 --> 1:04:36.306
>> YOUR BOY IS THE WISE ONE.

1:04:36.340 --> 1:04:39.977
HE USED HIS BRAIN, HE GOT HIS
HINT, AND HE'S GOING FOR SAFETY.

1:04:40.010 --> 1:04:41.145
>> GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.

1:04:41.178 --> 1:04:44.348
>> NICE.

1:04:44.381 --> 1:04:47.884
>> I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO BE ONE OF THE LAST ONES

1:04:47.918 --> 1:04:49.219
UP HERE.

1:04:49.253 --> 1:04:50.820
I DON'T WANT TO BE A THREAT IN
THIS HOUSE.

1:04:50.854 --> 1:04:54.091
I HAVE TO JUMP OFF THIS SOON SO
THAT WAY PEOPLE DON'T THINK THAT

1:04:54.124 --> 1:04:57.394
I'M PHYSICAL.

1:04:57.427 --> 1:04:58.895
( BUZZER ).

1:04:58.929 --> 1:05:00.931
>> Julie: CAMERON IS DOWN.

1:05:00.965 --> 1:05:02.199
GO AHEAD AND PICK AN APPLE.

1:05:02.232 --> 1:05:05.002
>> BUT AS SOON AS I JUMP OFF, I
FORGET ALL THE CLUES.

1:05:05.035 --> 1:05:07.771
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH SNAKE IS
SAFE, WHICH APPLE IS BETTER THAN

1:05:07.804 --> 1:05:09.673
THE NEXT.

1:05:09.706 --> 1:05:14.344
SO MUCH FOR ME BEING THE SMART
GUY IN THE HOUSE.

1:05:14.378 --> 1:05:18.949
>> Julie: THERE YOU GO.

1:05:18.983 --> 1:05:22.086
>> DOES THE WINNER ALSO GET A
KISS FROM THE SERPENT OF HIS OR

1:05:22.119 --> 1:05:22.953
HER CHOICE.

1:05:22.987 --> 1:05:24.188
>> WOOO!

1:05:24.221 --> 1:05:27.691
>> I'M LOOKING AT AVATAR,
HONESTLY.

1:05:27.724 --> 1:05:28.058
>> YEAH!

1:05:28.092 --> 1:05:29.293
>> I'M DONE.

1:05:29.326 --> 1:05:32.762
I KNOW I SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON
THIS COMPETITION, BUT ALL THESE

1:05:32.796 --> 1:05:35.732
SERPENTS IN THE YARD ARE
SLITHERING AND SLIDING AND I SEE

1:05:35.765 --> 1:05:37.234
THE ONE.

1:05:37.267 --> 1:05:38.668
MY SERPENTINE QUEEN.

1:05:38.702 --> 1:05:41.638
I DON'T CARE IF SHE'S POISONOUS.

1:05:41.671 --> 1:05:44.441
SHE'S THE BEST-LOOK SNAKE I'VE
EVER SEEN.

1:05:44.474 --> 1:05:45.442
SORRY, NICOLE.

1:05:45.475 --> 1:05:46.876
>> Julie: HALF OF YOU ARE LEFT.

1:05:46.910 --> 1:05:47.978
>> COME ON, CHRISTMAS!

1:05:48.012 --> 1:05:51.548
>> IT'S CHRISTMAS IN JUNE, HUH!

1:05:51.581 --> 1:05:52.916
>> COME ON, ALEX.

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:56.120
>> I BEAT DUDES EVERY DAY IN
VIDEO GAMES.

1:05:56.153 --> 1:05:59.323
BUT AS MUCH AS I'M A NERD, I'M
ALSO A MEATHEAD, AND I'M GOING

1:05:59.356 --> 1:06:00.090
TO CRUSH IT.

1:06:00.124 --> 1:06:04.328
>> COME ON, GUYS!

1:06:04.361 --> 1:06:05.495
>> Julie: LISTEN UP.

1:06:05.529 --> 1:06:16.640
AT LEAST ONE OF THE YELLOW
SNAKES IS HOLDING A SAFE APPLE.

1:06:16.673 --> 1:06:19.309
>> I'M HANGING ON, AND I'M DOING
GREAT.

1:06:19.343 --> 1:06:20.877
HOWEVER, I'M PLAYING THE MENTAL
GAME, TOO.

1:06:20.910 --> 1:06:24.381
I AM NOT GOING TO BE OVERLY
DOMINANT.

1:06:24.414 --> 1:06:27.084
IF YOU'RE TOO GOOD, THEY'RE
GOING TO GET RID OF YOU RIGHT

1:06:27.117 --> 1:06:27.717
AWAY.

1:06:27.751 --> 1:06:29.186
( BUZZER ).

1:06:29.219 --> 1:06:31.788
>> Julie: AND CHRISTMAS IS
DOWN AND PICKS HER APPLE.

1:06:31.821 --> 1:06:35.059
>> SHE'S GOT IT.

1:06:35.092 --> 1:06:39.429
>> ALEX, I'M EXTREMELY
IMPRESSED.

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:40.864
>> I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED, TOO.

1:06:40.897 --> 1:06:41.665
>> YOU SHOULD BE.

1:06:41.698 --> 1:06:44.000
>> ALEX, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD,
GIRL.

1:06:44.034 --> 1:06:45.202
>> DON'T THINK OF THAT.

1:06:45.235 --> 1:06:48.038
JUST LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL
FACE OVERS HERE CHEERING YOU ON.

1:06:48.072 --> 1:06:50.807
>> HELP ME, JESUS, HELP ME.

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:52.309
>> I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT.

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:58.082
I CAN FEEL THE MUSCLE STRAINING
IN MY LEGS, IN MY FEET NMY ARMS,

1:06:58.115 --> 1:07:01.385
IN MY SHOULDERS.

1:07:01.418 --> 1:07:02.852
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT,
HOUSEGUESTS.

1:07:02.886 --> 1:07:04.254
HOLD ON TIGHT BECAUSE THINGS ARE
ABOUT TO GET A LITTLE MORE

1:07:04.288 --> 1:07:11.561
DIFFICULT.

1:07:11.595 --> 1:07:15.865
>> I'M SO EXHAUSTED, I'M TRYING
TO FIND THE PAUSE BUTTON, BUT

1:07:15.899 --> 1:07:24.941
THEN I REALIZE, THIS IS REAL
LIFE.

1:07:24.974 --> 1:07:25.542
I CAN'T TAKE A BREAK.

1:07:25.575 --> 1:07:26.676
I CAN'T GET A SNACK.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:27.411
AND I AM THINKING I'M SCREWED.

1:07:27.444 --> 1:07:28.445
IT'S STARTING TO HURT, MAN.

1:07:36.686 --> 1:07:37.821
>> Julie: NICE JOB, YOU THREE.

1:07:37.854 --> 1:07:41.057
YOU HAVE BEEN ON JUST ABOUT AN
HOUR.

1:07:41.091 --> 1:07:44.161
THREE HOUSEGUESTS ARE LEFT, BUT
ONLY TWO APPLES REMAIN.

1:07:44.194 --> 1:07:46.796
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS ARE
NOT DYING RIGHT NOW.

1:07:46.830 --> 1:07:49.366
>> ALEX, YOU'RE A ROCK STAR.

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:51.568
>> IT'S DOWN TO ME AND ALEX.

1:07:51.601 --> 1:07:54.070
MY PRIDE IS ON THE LINE HERE.

1:07:54.104 --> 1:07:55.439
THIS IS DAY ONE OF "BIG
BROTHER."

1:07:55.472 --> 1:07:57.374
LOSING IS NOT AN OPTION AT THIS
POINT.

1:07:57.407 --> 1:07:58.575
I AM GOING TO GET THIS WIN.

1:07:58.608 --> 1:08:07.984
>> SO I HAVE CAPTAIN AMERICA ON
MY RIGHT, AND THIS CYBORG IN

1:08:08.017 --> 1:08:10.053
ALEX ON HIS RIGHT.

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:12.222
I'M STARTING TO REALLY HURT.

1:08:12.256 --> 1:08:15.359
I'M THINKING WHAT AM I GOING TO
DO?

1:08:15.392 --> 1:08:16.660
>> COME ON, GUYS!

1:08:16.693 --> 1:08:21.765
COME ON!

1:08:21.798 --> 1:08:25.169

MESSING AROUND.

>> YOU PRETTY SOLID RIGHT NOW?

1:08:26.703 --> 1:08:27.271
>> YEAH.

1:08:27.304 --> 1:08:28.972
>> I SEE MATT STRUGGLING.

1:08:29.005 --> 1:08:31.775
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR SOME
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE.

1:08:31.808 --> 1:08:34.578
SO I GO AHEAD AND TELL HIM, YO,
DUDE, I'M SOLID.

1:08:34.611 --> 1:08:37.714
EVEN THOUGH I'M STARTING TO FEEL
IT.

1:08:37.747 --> 1:08:42.752

>> I'M STARTING TO LOSE THE GRIP
ON THE BOTTOM OF MY ROPE.

POINT.

1:09:00.204 --> 1:09:03.540
I'M GOING TO TAKE A PAGE OUT OF
MY PLAYBOOK.

1:09:03.573 --> 1:09:07.544
I'M GOING TO USE A LITTLE
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE ON ALEX,

1:09:07.577 --> 1:09:09.179
JUST LIKE DIWITH MATT.

>> WHATEVER I CAN DO, FIGHT FOR
YOU IN ANOTHER COMPETITION.

WORK.

>> AND THINK ABOUT IT FOR A
SECOND.

1:09:31.067 --> 1:09:34.137
I DON'T NEED NO MAN TO GET ME
THROUGH THIS COMPETITION.

1:09:34.170 --> 1:09:36.640
I AM GOING TO GET THROUGH ON MY
OWN.

1:09:36.673 --> 1:09:37.841
IT'S TEAM ALEX FOR THE WIN.

>> I'M SO DAMN FOCUSED, THERE'S
NO EXCUSE NOT TO WIN IT.

1:09:46.416 --> 1:09:48.485
I SHOULD HAVE THIS IN THE BAG.

1:09:48.518 --> 1:09:50.186

1:11:06.996 --> 1:11:08.665
CHRISTMAS, YOU ARE NEXT.

1:11:08.698 --> 1:11:12.902
>> COME ON, BABY GIRL.

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:16.306
>> NO BAY.

1:11:16.340 --> 1:11:19.008
>> Julie: POISON APPLE FOR

1:11:19.042 --> 1:11:19.743
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1:11:19.776 --> 1:11:22.312
>> DAY ONE, AND I'M ON THE
BLOCK.

1:11:22.346 --> 1:11:24.080
I AM NOT READY TO GO HOME YET.

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:30.687
I HAVE NOT HAD MY OPPORTUNITY TO
PLAY "BIG BROTHER."

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:31.421
>> Julie: OKAY, CAMERON.

1:11:31.455 --> 1:11:32.989

1:11:33.022 --> 1:11:33.557
COME ON, BABY.

1:11:33.590 --> 1:11:34.324
I'M SO NERVOUS.

1:11:34.358 --> 1:11:35.659
MY PALMS ARE SWEATING.

1:11:35.692 --> 1:11:43.199
I'M PRAYING TO THE "BIG BROTHER"
GOD.

BUT THE BOY IS SAFE, BABY!

1:12:00.149 --> 1:12:01.017
AIN'T GOING NOWHERE!

1:12:01.050 --> 1:12:01.685
LET'S GO!

1:12:01.718 --> 1:12:02.919
LET'S GO!

1:12:02.952 --> 1:12:09.325

BUT OUGHT I WANT TO DO IS PUNT

1:12:09.359 --> 1:12:10.927
MY POISON APPLE OUT OF THIS
YARD.

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:13.830
>> THERE'S ONLY ONE SAFE APPLE
LEFT, AND IT BETTER BE MINE.

1:12:13.863 --> 1:12:17.333
BECAUSE I KNOW IF I'M UP ON THAT
BLOCK, I HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF

1:12:17.367 --> 1:12:20.069
GOING HOME.

1:12:20.103 --> 1:12:23.873
>> I'M A GOOD APPLE, AND I
DESERVE A GOOD APPLE.

1:12:23.907 --> 1:12:31.948

>> I AM SO HAPPY TO BE SAFE.

1:12:43.927 --> 1:12:46.996
BUT I'M INSTANTLY WORRIED ABOUT
GILLIAN.

1:12:47.030 --> 1:12:48.865
I'VE GOTTEN REALLY, REALLY CLOSE
TO THIS GIRL.

1:12:48.898 --> 1:12:50.900
AND I DON'T WANT HER LEAVING THE
HOUSE YET.

1:12:50.934 --> 1:12:52.402
>> IT'S OKAY, GUYS!

1:12:52.436 --> 1:12:54.704
>> YOU KILLED IT EITHER WAY.

1:12:54.738 --> 1:12:58.942
>> THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO
BE THE FIRST DAY OF THE GAME,

1:12:58.975 --> 1:13:00.777
PUT ON THE BLOCK.

1:13:00.810 --> 1:13:06.550
I'M ABOUT TO DO A LOT OF
SCRAMBLING, TRYING TO SAVE

1:13:06.583 --> 1:13:07.584
MYSELF.

1:13:07.617 --> 1:13:09.318

WHO WILL BE THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST

1:13:11.855 --> 1:13:13.022
EVICTED?

1:13:13.056 --> 1:13:16.693
AND COULD THE THIRD TEMPTATION
OF THE NIGHT CHANGE THE COURSE

1:13:16.726 --> 1:13:17.927
OF THE GAME?

1:13:17.961 --> 1:13:19.395

1:13:43.152 --> 1:13:46.022
SAFETY.

1:13:46.055 --> 1:13:48.592
BUT THERE IS STILL ONE
TEMPTATION REMAINING THAT COULD

1:13:48.625 --> 1:13:50.894
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

1:13:50.927 --> 1:13:55.999
IT'S TIME TO REVEAL THE FINAL
TEMPTATION OF THE NIGHT.

1:13:56.032 --> 1:13:58.502

TEMPTATION AND THE SAFETY

1:14:31.535 --> 1:14:32.802
TEMPTATION.

1:14:32.836 --> 1:14:36.172
THAT MEANS THE FINAL TEMPTATION
OF THE NIGHT WILL BE A

1:14:36.205 --> 1:14:39.543
TEMPTATION OF POWER.

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO,

1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:20.043
>> I'M GONNA SAY I HAVE TO GO

FOOLS.

1:16:39.462 --> 1:16:42.531
I WANT TO PUT THE FATE IN MY OWN
HANDS.

1:16:51.941 --> 1:16:54.543
>> I REALLY WANT TO COMPETE, BUT
I'M GOG HAVE A VOTE TO SEE WHERE

1:16:54.577 --> 1:16:57.580
I STAND WITH SOME OF THE OTHER
HOUSEGUESTS.

1:16:57.613 --> 1:16:59.916

BY A VOTE OF TWO TO ONE,
TONIGHT'S EVICTION WILL TAKE

SHORTLY.

1:17:35.651 --> 1:17:39.055
I SUGGEST YOU USE THIS TIME TO
CAMPAIGN FOR VOTES TO STAY.

1:17:39.088 --> 1:17:44.828
I'LL BE BACK SOON TO GET THINGS

>> CHRISTMAS, THE BODY BUILDER,
VOTES FOR A HOUSE VOTE!

1:17:49.165 --> 1:17:50.666
WHAT'S GOING ON!

1:17:50.700 --> 1:17:51.701
>> I'M SORRY, GUYS.

1:17:51.735 --> 1:17:52.568
>> I KNOW.

1:17:52.601 --> 1:17:53.202

>> I JUST NEED TO TALK TO
EVERYBODY, PITCH THEM MY

1:18:01.010 --> 1:18:01.610
LOYALTY.

1:18:01.644 --> 1:18:03.212
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SAD.

1:18:03.246 --> 1:18:05.949
I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE FIRST
HAMPSTER IN THIS CAGE TO GO

1:18:05.982 --> 1:18:06.249
HOME.

1:18:06.282 --> 1:18:06.649
NO WAY.

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:07.817
>> OH, MY GOD.

1:18:07.851 --> 1:18:11.755
OH, MY GOD, THERE'S JUST SO
LITTLE TIME TO CONVINCE THESE

1:18:11.788 --> 1:18:12.856
PEOPLE TO LET ME STAY HERE.

1:18:12.889 --> 1:18:16.325
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO.

1:18:16.359 --> 1:18:21.965
>> JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, LIKE,
I'M TINY BUT THERE ARE THINGS

1:18:21.998 --> 1:18:23.499
I'M NOT CAPABLE OF DOING.

1:18:23.532 --> 1:18:26.970
I'M FEELING PRETTY SAFE RIGHT
NOW, BUT YOU JUST NEVER KNOW

1:18:27.003 --> 1:18:27.737
YOU'RE A BEAST.

1:18:27.771 --> 1:18:30.073
>> NOW YOU'RE JUST FLATTERING
ME.

1:18:30.106 --> 1:18:31.274
YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH.

1:18:31.307 --> 1:18:34.944
>> I KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO
ASSUME I AM A COMPETITION BEAST

1:18:34.978 --> 1:18:35.945
AND I AM.

1:18:35.979 --> 1:18:38.047
HOWEVER, I NEED TO DOWNPLAY THAT
A LITTLE BIT.

1:18:38.081 --> 1:18:41.851
BECAUSE IF THEY KNOW THAT, THEY
WILL GET ME OUT FAST.

1:18:41.885 --> 1:18:47.723
>> ALL I NEED TO KNOW IS IF I'M
IN DANGER, I'M SAFE FROM YOU.

1:18:47.757 --> 1:18:49.692
>> I WANT YOU GUYS TO KEEP ME.

1:18:49.725 --> 1:18:52.428
I THINK WE CAN WORK WELL
TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE.

1:18:52.461 --> 1:18:55.431
>> I KNOW IT'S WHERE THE CART--
WHERE THE CHIPS-- WHERE THE

1:18:55.464 --> 1:18:56.332
CHIPS LIE.

1:18:56.365 --> 1:18:58.134
SO I'M JUST HERE TO PLEAD FOR
ANOTHER DAD.

1:18:58.167 --> 1:19:00.003
>> WE STILL HAVEN'T CHATTED.

1:19:00.036 --> 1:19:03.206
YOU TWO ARE, LIKE, LITTLE CUTIE
PIES.

1:19:03.239 --> 1:19:06.142
>> I'VE GOT YOU.

1:19:06.175 --> 1:19:06.810
>> MY MAN.

1:19:06.843 --> 1:19:08.511
>> MY MAN.

1:19:08.544 --> 1:19:09.278
>> KEEP ME SAFE.

1:19:09.312 --> 1:19:10.179
>> YOU GOT IT.

1:19:10.213 --> 1:19:22.325
>> I HOPE YOU GUYS KEEP ME SAFE,
YOU KNOW.

1:19:22.358 --> 1:19:24.660
>> I FEEL LIKE CHRISTMAS IS A
TRIPLE THREAT.

1:19:24.693 --> 1:19:28.865
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S SUPER GOOD
LOOKING, SUPER ATHLETIC, AND

1:19:28.898 --> 1:19:29.598
SUPER INTELLIGENT.

1:19:29.632 --> 1:19:30.834
SHE'S GOT TO GO TONIGHT.

1:19:30.867 --> 1:19:31.667
BETTER HOLD TIGHT.

1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:34.971
>> IT TOOK A LOT FOR ME TO COME
HERE.

1:19:35.004 --> 1:19:37.340
LIKE, YOU KNOW, I LOST 50
POUNDS.

1:19:37.373 --> 1:19:37.807
>> YOU GO, GIRL.

1:19:37.841 --> 1:19:38.741
>> YEAH.

1:19:38.774 --> 1:19:41.110
>> SO JILLIAN TELLS ME HER
WEIGHT LOSS STORY.

1:19:41.144 --> 1:19:45.048
AND I GET THE STRUGGLE, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, I BET YOU CAMERON

1:19:45.081 --> 1:19:48.184
AND CHRISTMAS HAVE, LIKE, THEIR
OWN STRUGGLES THAT THEY'VE GONE

1:19:48.217 --> 1:19:52.388
THROUGH TO GET TO TO TH POINT SO
IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO AFFECT

1:19:52.421 --> 1:19:53.289
ME MUCH.

1:19:53.322 --> 1:19:54.991
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A
STRIPTEASE, RIGHT?

1:19:55.024 --> 1:19:55.558
>> IF YOU WANT IT TO BE.

1:19:55.591 --> 1:19:56.459
>> I WILL DO IT.

1:19:56.492 --> 1:19:59.295
>> OKAY.

1:19:59.328 --> 1:20:08.237
>> OH, MY GOD!

1:20:08.271 --> 1:20:10.639
>> I RESPECT THAT.

1:20:10.673 --> 1:20:12.075
THAT'S TRYING HARD.

1:20:12.108 --> 1:20:13.609
THAT'S A SOLID CAMPAIGN.

1:20:13.642 --> 1:20:18.314
BUT THAT HAIRY BUTT IS NOT WAIT
TO MY HEART OR WAIT TO MY VOTE.

1:20:18.347 --> 1:20:21.584
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST-- I'M
JUST TRYING TO SAY, LIKE, YOU

1:20:21.617 --> 1:20:24.087
