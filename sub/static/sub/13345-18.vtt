WEBVTT

00:18.252 --> 00:20.221
IS-- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:20.321 --> 00:22.390
WE'VE BEEN KICKED OUT
OF OUR APARTMENT.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.025
WE COULDN'T AFFORD
THE MORTGAGE

00:25.126 --> 00:27.761
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

00:29.963 --> 00:32.933
( both laughing )

00:33.033 --> 00:35.469
WE WERE JUST JOKING.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.471
I'M GOING ON VACATION.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.441
OH, OKAY.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.646
( theme music playing )

01:01.095 --> 01:03.231
SO IS LUKE ON THE WAY?

01:03.331 --> 01:04.965
HE'S RUNNING LATE,
OF COURSE.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.868
BUT HE WILL BE HERE
TO PICK UP OLIVER BY
THE END OF THE SESSION.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.138
I WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD SPEAK TO YOU
ALONE FOR A MINUTE.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.339
I HAVE TO LEAVE
A LITTLE EARLY.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.973
SURE.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.709
OLIVER, IF YOU GET HUNGRY,
I HAVE SOME SNACKS
IN MY PURSE, OKAY?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.211
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.680
OKAY, I'LL JUST BE
A LITTLE BIT.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.014
WILL YOU BE
ALL RIGHT?

01:21.115 --> 01:22.516
I'LL DO MY HOMEWORK.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.552
OKAY.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.997
I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.733
THANK ME?
FOR WHAT?

01:39.833 --> 01:41.469
FOR EVERYTHING.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.337
RIGHT AFTER OUR SESSION
LAST WEEK

01:43.437 --> 01:45.539
LUKE AND I TOOK OLIVER
OUT TO DINNER

01:45.639 --> 01:47.175
AND WE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE ADOPTION

01:47.275 --> 01:49.377
JUST LIKE
YOU ASKED US TO.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.179
AND IMMEDIATELY
THE CLOUDS LIFTED.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.581
GOOD.
SO YOU'VE NOTICED

01:53.681 --> 01:57.518
A POSITIVE CHANGE
IN OLIVER'S ATTITUDE?

01:57.618 --> 02:00.454
THIS WEEK HE'S GOTTEN
ALL OF HIS HOMEWORK DONE
EVEN BEFORE DINNER.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.691
HE MADE A TERRARIUM
FOR HIS TURTLE

02:03.791 --> 02:05.526
OUT OF AN OLD
PASTA BOX.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.129
PLUS HE STOPPED GORGING
HIMSELF ON FOOD.

02:09.230 --> 02:12.065
AND HE ALREADY
LOOKS BETTER.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.101
AND IT'S ALL
THANKS TO YOU.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.069
WELL, THANK YOU, BESS.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.472
I APPRECIATE
THE COMPLIMENT,

02:18.572 --> 02:23.277
BUT I'M REALLY NOT SO SURE
IT'S ANYTHING I DID.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.313
HE'S EVEN SLEEPING
THROUGH THE NIGHT NOW.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.349
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
A RELIEF IT IS TO KNOW THAT
I CAN FINALLY LEAVE TOWN

02:28.449 --> 02:31.685
AND NOT FREAK OUT
THAT SOMETHING DISASTROUS
IS GONNA HAPPEN.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.388
MY FRIEND MICHELLE,
SHE'S GONNA BE HERE

02:34.488 --> 02:37.958
AT A QUARTER PAST
IN A RENTAL CAR.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.893
YOU SEEM EAGER TO LEAVE.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.095
WELL, WE WANT TO GET A JUMP
ON TRAFFIC, YOU KNOW.

02:42.196 --> 02:45.165
MICHELLE AND I HAVEN'T
DONE A TRIP LIKE THIS
SINCE COLLEGE.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.402
AND I DON'T EVEN CARE
WHERE WE GO.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.103
I JUST WANT
TO GET IN THE CAR
AND JUST DRIVE.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.473
I KNOW THE FEELING.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.542
YEAH,
AND THE ONLY REASON

02:54.642 --> 02:56.544
I CAN EVEN CONSIDER
LEAVING TOWN RIGHT NOW

02:56.644 --> 02:58.812
IS BECAUSE OLIVER
IS DOING SO WELL.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.982
SO THANK YOU AGAIN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.

03:02.082 --> 03:05.553
I DON'T MEAN
TO CONCERN YOU, BESS,

03:05.653 --> 03:07.355
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
THAT OLIVER'S CHANGED

03:07.455 --> 03:10.624
AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD
LIKE TO BELIEVE.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.627
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.929
WELL, IT STRIKES ME
AS UNUSUAL

03:16.029 --> 03:18.432
THAT HIS ISSUES,
HIS PROBLEMS

03:18.532 --> 03:21.402
HAVE JUST CLEARED UP
OVERNIGHT.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.404
YEAH, IT'S MORE
THAN UNUSUAL.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.474
IT'S LIKE
A MAGIC TRICK.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.310
YEAH, IT IS A LOT
LIKE A MAGIC TRICK,

03:29.410 --> 03:32.079
BY WHICH I WOULD MEAN

03:32.179 --> 03:34.382
THAT THERE'S
A VERY GOOD CHANCE

03:34.482 --> 03:36.750
THAT THIS IS
AN ILLUSION.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.720
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
TALKED TO HIM YET.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.990
MOST PEOPLE CAN'T
BREAK THEIR PATTERNS

03:43.090 --> 03:45.158
IN ONE WEEK, BESS.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.194
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT I CAN'T LEAVE HIM?

03:47.295 --> 03:49.363
NO, I'M ONLY SAYING
IT'S POSSIBLE

03:49.463 --> 03:51.365
THAT HE STARTED
BEHAVING WELL

03:51.465 --> 03:54.067
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO SEE HIM

03:54.167 --> 03:56.069
AS THE SOURCE
OF YOUR TROUBLES.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.706
THE SOURCE
OF MY TROUBLES?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.475
IF ANYTHING, HE'S BEEN
THE SAVING GRACE.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.345
MAYBE OLIVER BELIEVES
THAT IF HE BEHAVES PERFECTLY

04:04.445 --> 04:07.080
THAT HE CAN SOLVE

04:07.180 --> 04:09.617
ALL THE PROBLEMS
BETWEEN YOU AND LUKE.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.122
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO TO ME HERE.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.825
HOW AM I
CONFUSING YOU?

04:17.925 --> 04:20.761
WELL, FOR A MONTH NOW
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME
THAT I'M STUCK

04:20.861 --> 04:23.096
AND THAT I NEED TO GET
MY OWN LIFE TOGETHER

04:23.196 --> 04:24.498
AND LET MY SON
GROW UP INTO A MAN.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.467
AND THEN
THE FIRST CHANCE I HAVE

04:26.567 --> 04:28.402
TO GO HAVE SOME FUN
ON MY OWN,

04:28.502 --> 04:30.604
YOU SAY, "HE'S JUST
PRETENDING TO DO WELL

04:30.704 --> 04:32.706
AND HE ACTUALLY NEEDS YOU
VERY BADLY, BESS."

04:32.806 --> 04:34.442
BUT I'M NOT SAYING

04:34.542 --> 04:36.644
YOU NEED TO STAY HERE
AND TAKE CARE OF HIM.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.179
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A VACATION
WITHOUT LUKE AND OLIVER

04:39.279 --> 04:41.382
IN SIX YEARS.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.816
AND I THINK
I MORE THAN DESERVE

04:42.916 --> 04:44.985
TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME
FOR MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.987
OKAY, WHY RIGHT NOW?

04:47.087 --> 04:49.623
WHAT, BESIDES THE FACT

04:49.723 --> 04:53.160
THAT MY EX-HUSBAND HAS
A NEW GIRLFRIEND?

04:53.260 --> 04:55.996
I SAW HOW HARD THAT WAS
FOR YOU TO HEAR.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.401
NO, I'M ACTUALLY GLAD

05:00.501 --> 05:02.736
THAT LUKE IS
SLEEPING AROUND NOW,

05:02.836 --> 05:05.406
BECAUSE NOW
IT IS VERY CLEAR
THAT WE ARE DONE.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.409
HE'S EVEN STARTED
INTERVIEWING REPLACEMENTS.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.345
BUT LAST WEEK YOU WERE
VERY ANGRY ABOUT THAT.

05:11.445 --> 05:15.082
IT WAS A BUCKET
OF COLD WATER IN MY FACE.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.518
I'VE GOT TO GET
MY LIFE TOGETHER.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.388
OLIVER'S GONNA BE STAYING
AT LUKE'S MORE OFTEN NOW

05:20.488 --> 05:22.423
AND WHEN HE'S GONE
I CAN'T JUST

05:22.523 --> 05:25.158
PACE AROUND THE APARTMENT
LIKE A GHOST.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.729
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.299
( sighs )

05:32.400 --> 05:36.470
I'VE NEVER LIVED
BY MYSELF BEFORE.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.039
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.742
I THINK I CAN.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.546
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
HOW YOU AND LUKE
GOT TOGETHER?

05:51.084 --> 05:53.353
I GOT PREGNANT

05:53.454 --> 05:55.689
MY LAST SEMESTER
IN COLLEGE.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.891
I MOVED
RIGHT OUT OF THE DORM

05:57.991 --> 06:00.260
AND RIGHT IN
WITH LUKE.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.731
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.766
I HAVE A FEELING THAT
NOTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

06:05.866 --> 06:09.002
IN THE PAST 12 YEARS
HAS BEEN WHAT YOU'VE
HAD IN MIND.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.612
LUKE AND I HAD JUST GOTTEN
BACK FROM SPRING BREAK.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.516
I REMEMBER HIS DORM ROOM
SMELLED AWFUL

06:22.616 --> 06:24.485
BECAUSE HIS ROOMMATE

06:24.585 --> 06:29.189
HAD LEFT A PIZZA ON
THE COUNTER BEFORE VACATION.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.958
I TOLD HIM
I WAS PREGNANT

06:31.058 --> 06:34.261
AND HE DROPPED TO HIS KNEES
RIGHT ON THE SHAG RUG

06:34.361 --> 06:36.830
AND ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.766
I REMEMBER THINKING,

06:38.866 --> 06:41.902
"THIS IS PROBABLY
THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT
OF MY LIFE

06:42.002 --> 06:46.173
AND THE ROOM SMELLS
LIKE MOLDY PIZZA."

06:46.273 --> 06:49.543
SO DID YOU WANT
TO MARRY HIM?

06:49.643 --> 06:53.113
WELL, YEAH.
I WAS CRAZY ABOUT LUKE.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.449
AND I WAS SURE
I WOULD NEVER STOP

06:55.549 --> 06:57.985
BEING CRAZY ABOUT LUKE.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.853
I WAS 21.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.255
THAT'S VERY YOUNG
TO MAKE A BIG DECISION.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.559
MY PARENTS WERE FURIOUS
AT LUKE.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.361
WE DROVE TO HARTFORD
AND WE TOOK THEM OUT

07:08.462 --> 07:10.564
TO THE BEST RESTAURANT
WE COULD AFFORD,

07:10.664 --> 07:12.432
WHICH WAS
RUBY TUESDAY'S.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.168
( chuckles )
REALLY CLASSY, RIGHT?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.339
MY MOM WAS SO UPSET.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.977
SHE NEARLY CHOKED
ON HER FRIED SHRIMP.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.948
BUT THEN
OLIVER WAS BORN

07:28.048 --> 07:32.285
AND, YOU KNOW...

07:32.385 --> 07:34.187
WHAT?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.325
IT'S AMAZING.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.828
THE MOMENT
THEY SAW OLIVER,

07:40.928 --> 07:42.696
IT'S LIKE THEIR DAUGHTER
DISAPPEARED.

07:42.796 --> 07:47.400
I JUST BECAME THE MOTHER
OF THEIR GRANDCHILD.

07:47.501 --> 07:51.438
BUT THAT'S HOW I FELT
ABOUT HIM TOO.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.742
THE FIRST NIGHT
I BROUGHT HIM HOME

07:54.842 --> 07:57.978
I SAT BY HIS CRADLE
AND I WATCHED HIM SLEEPING
AND I THOUGHT,

07:58.078 --> 08:01.348
"THIS IS THE BEST THING
I'M EVER GONNA DO."

08:01.448 --> 08:04.652
YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT HOW LUKE FELT.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.859
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.261
YOU'RE NOT SURE?

08:14.361 --> 08:16.263
TO BE HONEST,
FOR A FEW YEARS THERE

08:16.363 --> 08:18.331
WE DIDN'T SEE
THAT MUCH OF EACH OTHER.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.467
HE WAS JUST GETTING
A TOEHOLD AT WORK.

08:20.568 --> 08:24.037
I WAS SO BUSY WITH OLIVER.
IT WAS LIKE WE WERE JUST
WORKING OPPOSITE SHIFTS

08:24.137 --> 08:27.174
IN SOME STRUGGLING
STARTUP BUSINESS, YOU KNOW?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.444
BUT I GOTTA HAND IT
TO LUKE,

08:31.545 --> 08:33.847
AS SOON AS OLIVER WAS READY
FOR KINDERGARTEN

08:33.947 --> 08:36.917
WE WERE DOING WELL ENOUGH
FOR ME TO START MY MASTER'S.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.588
I COULD TELL YOU
ABOUT THE NEXT FIVE YEARS,

08:40.688 --> 08:42.990
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT?

08:44.257 --> 08:46.426
I JUST COULDN'T
CONCENTRATE.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.697
MY KID WAS SICK

08:49.797 --> 08:51.665
OR HE COULDN'T SLEEP

08:51.765 --> 08:55.035
OR THERE WAS A BULLY
AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.771
DID YOU FEEL THAT OLIVER
WAS A BURDEN?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.740
NO.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.442
NO, OF COURSE I DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS A BURDEN.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.444
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.515
IT'S-- SCHOOL JUST DIDN'T
SEEM REAL TO ME.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.351
IT WAS JUST MAKING CRITICISM
ABOUT CRITICISMS

09:11.451 --> 09:14.955
AND MAKING THESE
MEANINGLESS DISTINCTIONS

09:15.055 --> 09:16.824
AND LOOKING AT ART
AND PRETENDING TO SEE THINGS

09:16.924 --> 09:18.992
THAT PROBABLY
AREN'T EVEN THERE.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.028
AND THEN I LOOKED
AT MY SON AND--

09:21.128 --> 09:23.196
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
OLIVER IS THE REASON

09:23.296 --> 09:25.098
THAT YOU DIDN'T
FINISH COLLEGE?

09:25.198 --> 09:27.034
I'M NOT BLAMING HIM.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.869
I'M NOT.

09:28.969 --> 09:32.572
IT WAS MY DECISION
TO PUT HIM FIRST.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.175
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I LOOK UP NOW

09:35.275 --> 09:37.044
AND I'M 33 YEARS OLD

09:37.144 --> 09:39.947
AND I'VE NEVER HAD A JOB
IN MY LIFE.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.783
AND I'M TERRIFIED.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.785
WHAT ARE YOU
TERRIFIED OF?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.387
UH, MY SON IS
GETTING OLDER.

09:47.487 --> 09:51.291
MY HUSBAND ISN'T
MY HUSBAND ANYMORE.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.327
I'M JUST
OVEREDUCATED ENOUGH

09:54.427 --> 09:56.296
TO BE COMPLETELY
UNEMPLOYABLE

09:56.396 --> 09:58.465
AT ANY SORT OF
MEANINGFUL JOB.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.600
YOU CAN CONTRADICT ME
HERE AT ANY TIME.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.636
BESS, YOU COULD ALSO
LOOK AT THIS

10:02.736 --> 10:04.805
AS AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY

10:04.905 --> 10:06.974
TO RECONNECT WITH THE PERSON
WHO DISAPPEARED 12 YEARS AGO

10:07.074 --> 10:09.977
AND TO TAKE A LEAP
INTO THE UNKNOWN.

10:13.513 --> 10:15.883
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU
AT ALL.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.551
I SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
WITH OLIVER

10:18.652 --> 10:21.521
AND I'M OVERPROTECTING HIM,
I'M SMOTHERING HIM.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.356
AND I TRY TO GET AWAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE

10:23.456 --> 10:25.092
AND I'M ABANDONING HIM.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.195
SO EITHER I'M TAKING
TOO MUCH CARE OF HIM
OR TOO LITTLE CARE OF HIM.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.832
SEEMS LIKE THIS IS
AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE
HAVING WITH YOURSELF.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.205
TRUTH IS...

10:39.840 --> 10:42.242
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.647
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.120
( sighs )

10:53.220 --> 10:56.289
YOU KNOW, MICHELLE IS PROBABLY
WAITING FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.558
SHE'S BEEN IN THE RENT--
OH, THERE SHE IS.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.061
I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.296
I'M ON VACATION.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.432
OLIVER WILL BE FINE,
RIGHT?

11:05.532 --> 11:08.035
HE'S 12 YEARS OLD.
IT'S A WEEK.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.638
ARE YOU ASKING
FOR MY PERMISSION?

11:11.739 --> 11:14.908
NO, I'M NOT--
I'M A GROWNUP, OKAY?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.845
I WAS ASKING FOR YOUR ADVICE.
ISN'T THAT YOUR JOB?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.951
OLIVER SWEETIE,
YOU WANT TO COME IN
AND SAY GOODBYE?

11:24.051 --> 11:27.020
Oliver:
ARE YOU LEAVING NOW?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.022
YES, MICHELLE'S
WAITING FOR ME.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.324
YOUR DAD WILL BE HERE
TO PICK YOU UP.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.526
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.096
I FEEL FINE.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.698
YOU'RE NOT JUST
SAYING THAT, RIGHT?

11:38.799 --> 11:41.368
IT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.805
Bess:
I WILL BE CALLING YOU
EVERY DAY, OKAY?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.840
IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM
OR YOU JUST WANT TO TALK,

11:46.940 --> 11:48.909
YOU CAN EVEN WAKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.643
I DON'T CARE, OKAY?

11:50.744 --> 11:53.113
OKAY.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.554
THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING, PAUL.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.590
AND I'M SORRY
TO RUN OUT ON YOU.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.258
NO PROBLEM.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.694
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.462
- BYE.
- BYE.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.517
Bess:
HEY, MICHELLE.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.522
WELL, YOUR MOM TOLD ME
IT'S A LONG TIME

12:35.622 --> 12:37.757
SINCE SHE'S BEEN AWAY
ON A TRIP.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.692
I'LL BE FINE.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.628
SO YOU GOT THINGS
UNDER CONTROL, YEAH?

12:41.728 --> 12:43.797
I'M GOOD.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.801
SO HOW HAS THE WEEK
BEEN FOR YOU?

12:47.901 --> 12:50.170
I DID ALL MY HOMEWORK.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.972
GOOD.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.808
AND HOW'S THE TURTLE?

12:54.908 --> 12:57.444
I MADE A NEW HOUSE FOR HIM
OUT OF AN OLD PASTA BOX.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.645
COOL.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.081
I PUT IN GRASS AND LEAVES
FROM THE PARK.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.551
SO YOU'VE MADE
A NICE HOME FOR HIM.
THAT'S GREAT.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.922
ARE YOU--

13:09.022 --> 13:10.757
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED

13:10.858 --> 13:12.860
ABOUT YOUR MOM
GOING AWAY?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.634
LAST WEEK
YOU WERE TELLING ME

13:21.734 --> 13:24.337
THAT YOU WERE HAVING TROUBLE
GOING TO SLEEP

13:24.437 --> 13:26.673
AND THAT WHEN YOUR MOM AND DAD
CAME IN TO CHECK ON YOU

13:26.773 --> 13:30.210
THAT YOU WERE KIND OF
PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.979
I'M SLEEPING FINE.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.684
GOOD. SO YOU'RE NOT
TIRED IN CLASS OR--?

13:37.784 --> 13:39.953
I JUST SAID I'M GETTING
ENOUGH SLEEP.

13:43.723 --> 13:47.660
AND HOW ARE THINGS GOING
AT YOUR DAD'S?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.596
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM
WHEN HE GETS HERE?

13:49.696 --> 13:52.232
OKAY.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.369
AND HOW'S SCHOOL?

13:56.469 --> 14:00.040
OKAY.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.310
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

14:03.410 --> 14:06.113
YOU TOLD ME THIS STORY
ABOUT A PARTY.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.881
AND THEN
THERE WAS A BOY

14:07.981 --> 14:10.217
- WHO DID SOMETHING MEAN
TO YOU, UM...
- ERIC.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.352
- ERIC.
- HE PISSED ON MY SHOES.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.454
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.856
HAS HE BEEN
BOTHERING YOU?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.692
HOW?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.761
RUINING MY LIFE.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.931
THERE'S THIS GIRL MAYA.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.866
YEAH, SHE WAS THE GIRL
WHO HAD THE PARTY.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.602
YEAH, WE HAVE
HUMANITIES TOGETHER.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.706
AND WE WERE
PARTNERS FOR THIS
COLONIAL LIFE PROJECT.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.575
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.245
WELL, WE DRESS UP
LIKE WE WERE IN
COLONIAL TIMES

14:38.345 --> 14:41.448
AND HAVE
OLD COLONIAL JOBS.

14:41.548 --> 14:45.118
I WAS A BLACKSMITH
AND MAYA WAS MY WIFE

14:45.218 --> 14:47.654
AND SHE MILKED THE COWS.
BUT IT WAS STUPID.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.223
- BUT SHE'S NICE.
- YEAH?

14:50.323 --> 14:52.059
SHE BRINGS CANDY
TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY

14:52.159 --> 14:53.760
AND ALWAYS
GIVES ME SOME.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.429
I WISH I HAD
A FRIEND LIKE THAT.

14:56.529 --> 15:00.833
BUT LAST WEEK ERIC WENT
ALL OVER SCHOOL

15:00.934 --> 15:03.203
SAYING I'M IN LOVE
WITH HER,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.672
BUT SHE'LL
NEVER GO OUT WITH ME
BECAUSE I'M TOO FAT.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.909
IT'S NOT FAIR.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.312
YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.781
IT ISN'T FAIR.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.417
I'M NOT GONNA BE
FAT ANYMORE.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.153
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.255
I STOPPED EATING
THIS WEEK.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.457
YOU'RE NOT EATING
ANYTHING AT ALL?

15:24.557 --> 15:26.459
WELL, NO.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.395
I HAVE A HALF A BOWL
OF CEREAL FOR BREAKFAST.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.198
I BUY LUNCH AT SCHOOL,
BUT I THROW IT OUT.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.101
I ONLY EAT A LITTLE
WHEN I'M WITH MY MOM.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.003
AND I DON'T EAT AT ALL
WHEN I'M WITH MY DAD.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.305
BUT HE DOESN'T NOTICE.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.341
DOESN'T THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL WEAK?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.144
I MEAN, IF YOU
DON'T EAT ANYTHING,

15:44.244 --> 15:47.614
HOW DO YOU HAVE ENERGY
TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY?

15:55.288 --> 15:59.359
YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT,

15:59.459 --> 16:02.195
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT
BY YOURSELF.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.832
AND YOU CERTAINLY
DO NOT NEED

16:05.932 --> 16:07.767
TO STOP EATING
ALTOGETHER.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.869
YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO HELP YOU WITH THIS.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.738
I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.073
AREN'T YOU HUNGRY?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.974
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.861
I REMEMBER LAST WEEK

16:34.961 --> 16:36.829
YOU WERE TELLING ME
THAT YOUR MOM AND DAD

16:36.929 --> 16:39.599
WERE PLANNING TO ADOPT
A BABY BOY.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.935
BUT YOU SAID
THAT THEY'D STOPPED
TALKING ABOUT IT.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.837
THEY EXPLAINED IT TO ME.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.539
AND WHAT DID THEY SAY?

16:46.639 --> 16:49.542
WELL, THEY WERE FIGHTING
TOO MUCH ABOUT THE BABY,

16:49.642 --> 16:51.711
SO THEY HAD TO GIVE HIM
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.214
AND HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

16:56.983 --> 16:59.252
IS THERE ANYTHING
ABOUT THE ADOPTION

16:59.352 --> 17:02.522
THAT YOU STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND?

17:03.890 --> 17:06.393
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA
TELL ME I WAS ADOPTED TOO.

17:06.493 --> 17:10.730
AND WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

17:10.830 --> 17:12.499
'CAUSE I DON'T LOOK
LIKE THEM.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.667
AND THAT'S ANOTHER
THING ERIC SAID.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.304
"YOUR MOM'S
SO SKINNY AND PRETTY,
YOU MUST BE ADOPTED."

17:17.404 --> 17:19.606
I HAVE TO SAY,
THAT KID ERIC--

17:19.706 --> 17:21.274
I REALLY
CANNOT STAND HIM.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.976
BUT HE'S RIGHT.
I DON'T LOOK LIKE
MY MOM OR MY DAD.

17:24.077 --> 17:27.547
I MIGHT BE ADOPTED.

17:27.647 --> 17:31.118
SO WOULD THAT BE

17:31.218 --> 17:34.121
A GOOD THING
OR A BAD THING?

17:34.221 --> 17:36.756
MY PARENTS WERE FIGHTING
ABOUT MY BROTHER,

17:36.856 --> 17:39.926
SO THEY JUST
GAVE HIM AWAY.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.728
SO DO YOU THINK

17:41.828 --> 17:44.264
THAT IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE
THE WAY THEY WANT YOU TO,

17:44.364 --> 17:48.701
THAT THEY MIGHT
GIVE YOU AWAY?

17:51.871 --> 17:55.175
YOUR MOM AND DAD,
THEY MIGHT GET UPSET
SOMETIMES

17:55.275 --> 17:57.810
NO MATTER HOW WELL
YOU BEHAVE.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.279
BUT I MAKE THINGS WORSE.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.215
SOMETIMES IT'S THE PEOPLE
THAT WE LOVE THE MOST

18:02.315 --> 18:04.784
WHO UPSET US THE MOST.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.292
I WISH I WAS ADOPTED.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.863
YEAH.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.031
YOU KNOW,

18:19.132 --> 18:21.701
I USED TO FEEL
LIKE THAT MYSELF

18:21.801 --> 18:23.470
WHEN I WAS A KID.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.004
YOU DID?

18:25.104 --> 18:28.275
ABSOLUTELY.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.716
I WANT THEM
TO GIVE ME AWAY.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.287
WHY WOULD YOU WANT THAT?

18:40.387 --> 18:43.590
'CAUSE THEY
FIGHT ALL THE TIME,
NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.226
AND NOW THEY'RE SEPARATED,
BUT THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.628
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY
NOT GONNA STOP.

18:54.100 --> 18:59.105
SO IF THEY DID

18:59.206 --> 19:03.876
GIVE YOU AWAY,
AS YOU SAID,

19:03.976 --> 19:06.279
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'D GO?

19:06.379 --> 19:08.315
WELL, THEY SAID WHEN THEY
GAVE MY BROTHER BACK,

19:08.415 --> 19:10.683
THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO WANTED HIM.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.553
MAYBE I COULD GO
SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT,

19:13.653 --> 19:16.088
WITH PARENTS
WHO'LL WANT ME.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.258
DO YOU REALLY FEEL

19:18.358 --> 19:22.161
THAT YOUR MOM AND DAD
DON'T WANT YOU?

19:28.535 --> 19:31.504
MY DAD SHOULD
BE HERE BY NOW.

19:31.604 --> 19:36.008
YEAH, I GUESS HE'S
RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.710
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL HIM FOR YOU?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.479
NO, I CAN DO IT.

19:39.579 --> 19:43.182
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA GO
TO HIS VOICEMAIL.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.262
HEY, DAD.
IT'S ME, OLIVER.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.565
I'M WITH PAUL
WAITING FOR YOU.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.633
BYE.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.705
I CAN LEAVE NOW
IF YOU WANT.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.807
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

20:07.907 --> 20:10.009
MY NEXT APPOINTMENT
WAS JUST CANCELLED.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.280
SO YOU CAN HANG OUT
HERE IF YOU WANT.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.315
SHOULD I GO
IN THE OTHER ROOM?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.350
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.252
YOU CAN STAY HERE
IF YOU'D LIKE.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.053
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

20:21.153 --> 20:22.455
WE COULD TALK.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.692
WE COULD PLAY A GAME.

20:25.792 --> 20:29.362
YOU COULD TEACH ME
HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK
FINALLY.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.870
I'M STARVING.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.311
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO MAKE YOU A SANDWICH?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.648
OKAY, THE KITCHEN
IS OVER HERE.

21:10.803 --> 21:15.274
SO, HAM?
CHEESE?

21:15.375 --> 21:18.845
COULD I HAVE
A HAM AND SWISS CHEESE
WITH MUSTARD?

21:20.146 --> 21:21.981
OKAY.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.283
I THINK
I CAN DO THAT.

21:26.653 --> 21:30.156
I'VE JUST GOT
THIS BROWN BREAD.
IS THAT OKAY?

21:30.256 --> 21:32.625
YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.764
WHERE DOES THAT DOOR GO?

21:37.864 --> 21:40.500
THAT'S WHERE I SLEEP.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.303
AND WHAT ABOUT
THAT ONE?

21:44.404 --> 21:47.374
THAT'S JUST
ANOTHER ENTRANCE.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.275
HOW MANY SLICES
DO YOU WANT?

21:49.376 --> 21:51.744
- JUST ONE OF EACH.
- ONE OF EACH.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.480
OKAY.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.755
- THANKS.
- OKAY.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.766
DID YOUR SON
DRAW THAT PICTURE?

22:19.238 --> 22:21.841
YES, HE DID.

22:23.309 --> 22:25.778
IS THAT THE HOUSE
WHERE HE LIVES?

22:25.878 --> 22:28.347
YEAH.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.090
HOW IS IT?

22:38.190 --> 22:40.460
IT'S GOOD.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.404
ARE YOU STILL HUNGRY?

23:03.750 --> 23:06.419
( theme music playing )
