01:49.100 --> 01:50.550
- We've been looking for you.

01:51.510 --> 01:54.500
Stop your antics and become my wife.

01:57.170 --> 01:58.170
- Leave.

01:58.170 --> 02:01.140
Or I'll beat you to a
pulp with your own stick.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.699
- Are you gonna let her
speak to you like that?

02:08.699 --> 02:09.650
- But what do I do?

02:09.650 --> 02:11.039
She won't do what I say?

02:11.039 --> 02:12.622
It's madness.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.660
- Women these days.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.040
They need discipline.

02:25.161 --> 02:26.575
- But I want her to like me.

02:26.575 --> 02:28.810
I want her to give me
back massages and stuff.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.500
- You need to put her in her place.

02:32.370 --> 02:33.320
Put your foot down.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.280
- You better do what you're told woman!

02:36.280 --> 02:38.420
Otherwise, you're gonna, you know.

02:39.470 --> 02:41.330
- No, I don't know.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.782
- You're gonna, you know.

02:44.782 --> 02:45.615
- No, I don't know.

02:48.890 --> 02:50.140
- You're gonna regret it!

02:53.350 --> 02:54.850
- Let me handle this.

02:54.850 --> 02:57.135
She's my wife.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.420
- You wish.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.080
I belong to no one.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.960
And if you get one step
closer, you will regret it.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.790
- Stand your ground!

04:00.790 --> 04:02.180
You're letting her step all over you!

04:02.180 --> 04:05.210
- Yeah, she's threatening
your sacred masculine.

04:05.210 --> 04:06.210
- Defend your honor!

04:07.210 --> 04:08.310
- Show her who's boss.

09:06.070 --> 09:07.760
- Kaya, I hate it when you're weird.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.610
You better hurry.

09:50.003 --> 09:51.508
Kaya get a move on!

09:51.508 --> 09:52.341
- [Kaya] School doesn't start

09:52.341 --> 09:53.908
for half an hour Claire!
- Well, it takes 20 minutes

09:53.908 --> 09:55.348
for you to walk, and I'm not driving you

09:55.348 --> 09:58.421
and missing my morning jog with Courtney!

09:58.421 --> 09:59.828
There is one thing you
simply cannot do yourself,

09:59.828 --> 10:00.828
and that is wake up.

10:01.730 --> 10:04.181
- I woke up doing Kung Fu again.

10:04.181 --> 10:06.310
Like the stuff in movies.

10:06.310 --> 10:09.170
Funny thing is I've never
done Kung Fu, in real life,

10:09.170 --> 10:11.510
except for what I've managed
to learn off YouTube.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.710
I wish I could just prove to
the world that we really do

10:13.710 --> 10:18.000
live within some primitive
form of virtual reality.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.000
What happened to my
Ruroni Kenshin lunch bag?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.990
- I'm helping you not look
like an 8-year-old boy

10:25.990 --> 10:28.020
trapped inside a 16-year-old girl's body.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.860
Besides it matches your outfit.

10:29.860 --> 10:30.693
- It does?

10:31.924 --> 10:33.470
But what if I am an
eight-year-old boy trapped

10:33.470 --> 10:36.540
in this pathetic shell of
an existential experience!

10:36.540 --> 10:39.590
- You know even with your
4.3 GPA you still manage

10:39.590 --> 10:42.581
to make this foster mom,
feel like an utter failure.

10:42.581 --> 10:44.510
- I flushed a sock down your toilet.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.390
To punish you for being
amazing, I love you.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.850
- Good, you better.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.820
I packed you organic PB
& J with sprouted wheat,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.220
promise me Kaya you're not going to eat

10:54.220 --> 10:56.600
any of that restaurant crap, I mean it.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.480
It's hormone injected meat mulch!

10:59.430 --> 11:01.000
There's enough food to
last you the entire day.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.280
- Okay get out of here
already you hot mom you.

11:53.455 --> 11:54.538
- Kaya, Kaya!

12:02.550 --> 12:05.010
- Hey Ramseys what've you got?

12:05.010 --> 12:05.843
- Rocks.

12:08.060 --> 12:08.893
- For how much?

12:10.390 --> 12:11.844
- For $5.

12:11.844 --> 12:13.860
- $5, you're kidding right?

12:13.860 --> 12:15.290
- Don't be a cheapskate!

12:15.290 --> 12:17.560
- Yeah don't be a cheapskate.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.330
He's has bills to pay you know?

12:23.460 --> 12:26.220
- I'll take the quartz crystal.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.980
But all I have is a dollar.

12:29.170 --> 12:31.360
- Can you believe this girl?

12:31.360 --> 12:32.210
Shameless.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.230
- Don't be a greedy.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.700
I'm offering you a dollar,
take it or leave it!

12:35.700 --> 12:39.124
- But you don't get the
crystal, take that one!

12:39.124 --> 12:40.761
- Fine.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.094
- Give me that!

12:43.022 --> 12:44.772
- Oh no I got to go.

13:18.020 --> 13:20.370
- How many points do I
get for hitting a freak?

13:23.530 --> 13:25.690
- Whoa, hey Sasha.

13:25.690 --> 13:28.060
You're violating your
restraining order you know.

13:28.060 --> 13:30.560
Cops could be anywhere.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.650
- Shut up.

13:31.650 --> 13:33.740
You think I care about a
stupid restraining order?

13:33.740 --> 13:36.770
You're just an emo piss on and I'm a boss.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.240
- Okay, alright you're the boss Sasha.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.780
But I'm not going to stay quiet.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.820
You jump me again, I'm pressing charges.

13:44.761 --> 13:45.870
You can't just go around
beating people up you know?

13:45.870 --> 13:47.220
I'm sorry what was that?

13:48.120 --> 13:48.953
- You can't just--

13:48.953 --> 13:51.370
- Oh, I don't understand,
I don't speak human trash.

13:52.760 --> 13:53.593
- Why are you so mean?

13:53.593 --> 13:54.730
- Give me your phone.

13:54.730 --> 13:55.960
- I don't have it.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.410
- Not not, kill kill, get it.

14:00.980 --> 14:02.730
- What are you doing?

14:10.644 --> 14:13.730
What are you doing?

14:15.170 --> 14:17.460
- I just posted on your Facebook,

14:17.460 --> 14:19.680
looks like you're already
getting notifications.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.513
Good luck.

14:21.400 --> 14:26.400
- I'm unfriending you because
you are a racist bigot.

14:26.495 --> 14:29.310
Sasha, how could you write that?

14:29.310 --> 14:30.520
- Like I said, good luck.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.080
You'll have much bigger
fish to fry here soon.

14:37.140 --> 14:40.850
- I am not racist I was hacked!

15:21.300 --> 15:24.407
- She is a complete failure at life.

15:24.407 --> 15:25.480
- Oh, that's rough.

15:26.390 --> 15:27.710
- That's pretty pathetic.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.220
- Hey take it easy.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.570
Kaya's a survivor, she'll
make sense of it pretty soon.

15:32.570 --> 15:33.440
I'm sure of it.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.068
- That anyone can survive
in a world as soft as this

15:37.068 --> 15:39.570
is a mystery to be sure.

15:39.570 --> 15:41.170
- She's a warrior by birthright.

15:41.170 --> 15:42.610
Have faith Tai Fong.

15:42.610 --> 15:44.640
- Being born into one of the
greatest warrior bloodlines

15:44.640 --> 15:46.690
on Earth did nothing for the others.

15:46.690 --> 15:50.610
- But Kaya is different, she has to be.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.700
- For your sake, she better be.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.590
- Well I hope she gets
her act together soon,

15:54.590 --> 15:56.790
because she is boring me out of my mind.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.660
- Be careful you might
have to wear those robes

15:58.660 --> 16:00.380
for another 10,000 years.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.550
- I look good, in anything.

16:02.550 --> 16:04.250
- Yeah you wish.
- I do!

16:41.400 --> 16:42.880
- Hey Kaya, what's up girlfriend?

16:46.764 --> 16:49.360
- Hey, so, you didn't see the post?

16:49.360 --> 16:51.300
- Oh, I saw it, everybody saw it.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.360
That Sasha is one evil conundrum.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.380
- She's something else.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.120
Well, the usual?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.130
- You know it.

17:01.970 --> 17:04.583
- Shoot you got peanut butter and jelly

17:04.583 --> 17:06.480
with sprouted greens, girl
you know how to do me.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.530
- But today I'm keeping
the smoothie for myself.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.480
My biggest problem in
life is my foster mom

17:12.480 --> 17:13.905
trying to overfeed me.

17:13.905 --> 17:15.690
- Yo that is a good problem.

17:15.690 --> 17:19.020
- This is true, but I still need--

17:19.020 --> 17:19.853
- Oh, girl you know I'm good for it.

17:19.853 --> 17:21.819
We've only been doing
this since 5th grade.

17:27.150 --> 17:28.420
There, you happy?

17:28.420 --> 17:29.500
- Excellent!

17:29.500 --> 17:31.020
- So, what you saving up for?

17:31.020 --> 17:32.260
Ain't you got a J-O-B?

17:32.260 --> 17:34.380
- Yo, Sabrina when yo mamma gonna find out

17:34.380 --> 17:36.780
your voluptuous curves because
you eat like 10 times a day?

17:36.780 --> 17:38.690
- Man shut up Mariah.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.530
This meal would of cost
me $7.50 at Nugget Market.

17:40.530 --> 17:43.190
That is like a 375% savings alright.

17:44.490 --> 17:47.980
Shoot you got me coconut almond milk!

17:47.980 --> 17:49.590
- So, what you saving up for anyway?

17:49.590 --> 17:52.070
A one-way ticket out of the projects?

17:52.070 --> 17:53.620
- The projects don't exist here.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.430
- Mariah, you don't live in no projects.

17:55.430 --> 17:57.810
You live in a 3,000-square foot house.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.324
- Yo that don't matter!

17:59.324 --> 18:01.420
- And drop your accent, that
is cultural appropriation.

18:01.420 --> 18:06.000
- So you can talk like me,
but I can't talk like you?

18:06.000 --> 18:06.990
That is racist.

18:06.990 --> 18:08.590
- Girl you are not marginalized

18:08.590 --> 18:10.423
therefore you need to be shut down.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.803
- Oh, I'm marginalized!

18:11.803 --> 18:12.980
- You are not marginalized!
- Yes, I am marginalized!!

18:12.980 --> 18:14.263
- You got like a 7th jacuzzi in your house

18:14.263 --> 18:17.820
- So, I'm saving up for
those anime Blue Rays.

18:17.820 --> 18:20.319
- Girl don't you have all those seasons?

18:20.319 --> 18:21.400
We pirated them like 4 years ago.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.680
- Now that I have money, I'm supporting

18:23.680 --> 18:25.590
the creators of content I enjoy.

18:25.590 --> 18:29.300
- Oh, I get it, you're going
all straight laced on us.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.180
Turning your back on a life of crime.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.460
- I wouldn't go that far.

18:32.460 --> 18:34.973
- Yo so my boy Christian
ask you out already?

18:34.973 --> 18:36.439
- What? Eww.

18:36.439 --> 18:37.719
He has a beard.

18:37.719 --> 18:39.410
- Yeah, he's 16 with a beard, that's hot.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.700
Look, you've been working
with him for a month already,

18:41.700 --> 18:42.780
give him a shot!

18:43.799 --> 18:45.349
- Hmmm let me think about that.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.033
No.

18:58.839 --> 19:00.030
- See that's my girl Kaya.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.660
We are going to start up a
dessert business together

19:01.660 --> 19:03.260
and we gonna be fortune 500 fools!

19:03.260 --> 19:04.380
- What are you gonna sell?

19:04.380 --> 19:05.213
You don't even know how to cook.

19:05.213 --> 19:06.690
- Man Mariah, sometimes
I want to slap you.

19:06.690 --> 19:09.400
- Whatever, you don't even
know how to boil water.

19:18.577 --> 19:21.460
- Kaya, I know you said you
don't want to be adopted,

19:21.460 --> 19:24.870
but eval's are Monday,
the offer still stands.

19:24.870 --> 19:26.980
I'd love to be your forever mom.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.480
Promise you'll think about it?

22:57.370 --> 23:00.960
- That, that was amazing.

23:04.979 --> 23:09.820
Hey, hey!

23:11.580 --> 23:14.280
Samurai Master dude, hello?

23:14.280 --> 23:15.150
I said hey!

23:16.087 --> 23:18.610
- Hoy, you can see me?

23:18.610 --> 23:19.443
- Of course, I can see you!

23:19.443 --> 23:22.967
Or I don't know, this could
be a glitch in the VR system.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.410
- My name is Tai Fong.

23:24.410 --> 23:26.470
Sworn protector of the
Wing Chun blood line,

23:26.470 --> 23:29.070
which is everlasting and eternal, as am I.

23:30.646 --> 23:31.490
- What?

23:34.040 --> 23:36.620
- My name is Tai Fong,
sworn protector of the-

23:36.620 --> 23:38.070
- Ya, Wing Chun and all that.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.630
What is the Wing Chun blood line?

23:47.920 --> 23:48.753
- It's you.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.760
You are the bloodline.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.220
- Hi, I'm Japh.

23:54.798 --> 23:56.810
- You are the last remaining
survivor of the Wing Chun

23:56.810 --> 23:59.430
blood line as we feared.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.500
This battle was one of many.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.410
I'm going to have to
unlock your Chi source!

24:04.782 --> 24:05.670
- Whoa whoa whoa!

24:05.670 --> 24:08.120
What are you doing, what are you doing?

24:08.120 --> 24:09.440
- I'm unlocking your Chi source!

24:09.440 --> 24:11.380
And after that, we are leaving.

24:11.380 --> 24:12.840
This place is not safe.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.800
- Okay no, I heard I had big fish to fry.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.930
But this is not what I had in mind!

24:18.930 --> 24:22.300
- Hi, I'm Goku, and I'm
amazing and powerful

24:22.300 --> 24:23.410
and you'll want my help.

24:23.410 --> 24:24.470
But I'm humble too.

24:24.470 --> 24:26.470
So, don't worship me, I'm not into that.

24:29.893 --> 24:32.080
- I think she can handle herself Goku.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.150
- Hi, I'm Sari.

24:34.150 --> 24:35.960
I'm programmed to destroy things.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.760
Angel of destruction, that's me.

24:48.770 --> 24:51.850
- So, is there like an anime
convention nearby or something?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.620
Why are you all dressed like that?

24:56.570 --> 24:57.570
- Dressed like what?

24:59.330 --> 25:01.930
- Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions.

25:01.930 --> 25:03.400
Who are you people?

25:03.400 --> 25:05.530
- What do you mean by you people?

25:05.530 --> 25:07.571
- Oh no I didn't write that!
- I'm kidding.

25:07.571 --> 25:12.571
- The question you should
be asking is who are you?

25:21.810 --> 25:23.530
- Did you know that microprocessor

25:23.530 --> 25:26.460
has a sales history dating back to 1987?

25:26.460 --> 25:28.351
That's pretty impressive.

25:28.351 --> 25:29.320
- Oh, geez don't do that.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.590
- Excuse me?

25:30.590 --> 25:33.310
- Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't talking to you.

25:43.740 --> 25:46.330
- Do you serve anything with
certified organic barley?

25:46.330 --> 25:47.163
- No.

25:48.309 --> 25:50.200
- See if you did that, you'd
get so much more business.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.230
- Stop that.

25:52.230 --> 25:53.780
- What's that?

25:53.780 --> 25:55.880
- I mean, I'll tell the
owner you said that.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.770
- Don't worry, they can't see us.

25:57.770 --> 25:59.080
Only you can.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.077
Which means when you talk to us,

26:01.077 --> 26:02.378
everyone thinks you're crazy.

26:02.378 --> 26:03.994
- Your cash register has
enough coding capacity

26:03.994 --> 26:05.594
to be a small time machine.

26:05.594 --> 26:07.760
- Do you cook your chow
mein in coconut oil?

26:07.760 --> 26:09.200
- No, it's canola oil.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.770
- Yikes, maybe not that then.

26:12.437 --> 26:14.040
- Stop it!

26:15.035 --> 26:16.452
Get away from me!

26:22.538 --> 26:25.690
You know maybe you should
eat somewhere else.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.180
I'm getting the feeling that
we won't be able to serve you

26:29.180 --> 26:31.360
anything that fits your standards.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.970
- Right? You understand.

26:32.970 --> 26:35.780
I mean this place is so, ugh.

26:37.990 --> 26:41.710
- It's right around the corner
actually, and to the left.

26:41.710 --> 26:44.694
They have everything you deserve.

26:44.694 --> 26:45.777
- Thank you.

26:51.635 --> 26:54.050
- More of those been
coming around here lately.

26:57.813 --> 27:01.090
- It's a beautiful thing
to take care of yourself.

27:01.090 --> 27:02.740
It's another thing to use it as an excuse

27:02.740 --> 27:03.910
to cut people down.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.557
- That was so rude I'm
going to tell your manager.

27:15.557 --> 27:19.510
- Really, because that store serves food

27:19.510 --> 27:20.880
with certified organic barley.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.580
They also have food canned in coconut oil.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.510
Like I said, they have food
that fits your standards,

27:25.510 --> 27:26.960
and its everything you deserve.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.810
- How dare you?

27:27.810 --> 27:31.380
You think sending me to a dog
food store is going to fly?

27:31.380 --> 27:34.220
You are so getting fired missy.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.350
- Look, you are misunderstanding me.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.830
With the whole ethical
standards for all life

27:38.830 --> 27:41.990
on the planet movement, there
is a whole community of people

27:41.990 --> 27:44.470
who are eating what animals
eat, and enjoying it.

27:44.470 --> 27:48.020
There is even a chili made
from pedigree dog food.

27:49.740 --> 27:50.573
- You're lying!

27:51.658 --> 27:52.825
- Google, it.

28:00.620 --> 28:01.940
- Sorry I didn't know.

28:03.077 --> 28:04.590
- It's okay I was just trying to help.

28:04.590 --> 28:06.360
Here's an egg roll on the house.

28:15.250 --> 28:16.500
- Seriously?

28:16.500 --> 28:19.010
I had no idea that was a thing either.

28:19.010 --> 28:19.843
- It's not.

28:21.072 --> 28:22.597
- What?

28:22.597 --> 28:24.800
- I made the website.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.330
- No!

28:26.330 --> 28:28.870
- And it's ranked #2 when you type in

28:28.870 --> 28:30.120
chili made from dog food.

28:31.380 --> 28:34.500
- Well people really got to
check their facts you know?

29:07.480 --> 29:08.980
You doing anything later?

29:09.900 --> 29:14.840
- Actually, you all need to disappear.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.120
- Point taken.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.705
I wasn't trying to ask
you out or anything.

29:18.705 --> 29:20.500
- Oh no! I wasn't, I was just.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.150
- No, it's cool you don't
have to explain, it's okay.

29:26.624 --> 29:28.790
- Okay, I see where this is going--

29:44.170 --> 29:46.380
You need to stop doing that!

29:46.380 --> 29:49.158
- She's right we need to
leave her alone, let's go.

29:49.158 --> 29:51.180
- We will not be doing that.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.400
She needs to understand
we are not going anywhere

29:53.400 --> 29:54.770
until the bloodline is restored.

29:54.770 --> 29:57.090
Do you even understand
what is at stake here?

29:57.090 --> 29:58.720
- What does that even mean?

29:58.720 --> 30:00.890
I'm still not sure who any of you are!

30:00.890 --> 30:02.450
I mean every time I ask you a question,

30:02.450 --> 30:03.920
you respond with a question.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.980
And for some unknown
reason you're obsessed

30:06.980 --> 30:08.170
with cutting off my arms!

30:08.170 --> 30:09.270
Who does that?

30:15.140 --> 30:16.990
- How much can she know?

30:16.990 --> 30:20.180
- Nothing, she has to figure
everything out on her own.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.690
And by the looks of it,
it's gonna be awhile.

30:22.690 --> 30:23.620
- So, we just hang out?

30:23.620 --> 30:25.710
Until a demon banshee tries to kill her

30:25.710 --> 30:27.080
and then we intervene?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.790
- That's what we've always done,

30:28.790 --> 30:31.010
only now she can see us doing it.

30:31.010 --> 30:33.020
- And that's not working
out too well anymore.

30:33.020 --> 30:35.300
- For her it's not working
out, I'm fine with it.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.040
- Why can't we tell her
any of this when she won't

30:37.040 --> 30:39.660
remember it at all once
the bloodline is restored?

30:39.660 --> 30:41.960
- We cannot give mortals any knowledge

30:41.960 --> 30:44.050
of the past or the future.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.770
They have to come to that
information on their own agency.

30:46.770 --> 30:48.080
- He's right Japh.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.700
If we tell her anything, it
could rob her of the experiences

30:50.700 --> 30:53.660
she needs to make informed
decisions on her mortal walk.

30:53.660 --> 30:55.410
Our duty is to protect her.

30:55.410 --> 30:56.570
Beyond that--

30:56.570 --> 30:59.490
- We will never gain her trust
if we leave her in the dark.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.400
- Don't take it personal,

31:00.400 --> 31:01.730
but who has ever gained Kaya's trust?

31:03.140 --> 31:05.160
- How do we disappear from her sight then?

31:05.160 --> 31:06.350
- We don't.

31:06.350 --> 31:07.800
She can cross servers now.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.435
We can't hide from her.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.352
No one can.

31:27.093 --> 31:27.926
- No!

32:22.832 --> 32:24.315
- Don't! Don't! Don't!

32:24.315 --> 32:25.732
Why can't I move?

32:30.900 --> 32:33.000
- Your eye sight will
be clear in a moment.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.870
Your wound is nearly healed.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.230
It's okay, you're safe.

32:37.771 --> 32:39.370
- What happened?

32:39.370 --> 32:41.890
- You were nearly killed
by a demon banshee.

32:41.890 --> 32:46.192
Now you are here in the Immortal Realm.

33:05.813 --> 33:07.760
- Where is everybody?

33:07.760 --> 33:09.270
- Japh is re-scripting the last 10 minutes

33:09.270 --> 33:11.660
of the Mortal realm to save your life.

33:11.660 --> 33:13.550
That wound of yours will be
tender for a little while,

33:13.550 --> 33:15.350
until he has finished the override.

33:15.350 --> 33:18.140
Sari and Goku are fending
off the demon banshees

33:18.140 --> 33:19.980
so that he can work in peace.

33:23.355 --> 33:24.752
We'll have to get moving in a minute.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.420
We can't stay here for long.

33:27.780 --> 33:28.613
- I thought you said it was safe?

33:28.613 --> 33:30.150
- Nowhere is safe for long.

33:30.150 --> 33:32.050
This is the Immortal Realm.

33:32.050 --> 33:33.540
It doesn't work the same.

33:33.540 --> 33:36.300
Time, weather, everything can change.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.210
You might have the power to cross servers.

33:38.210 --> 33:39.950
But you are not an immortal.

33:39.950 --> 33:43.430
- So, you and Japh, Sari, and Goku.

33:44.330 --> 33:47.240
You are all immortals?

33:47.240 --> 33:49.670
Or users of the VR world?

33:51.312 --> 33:52.395
- Precisely!

33:55.792 --> 33:58.100
- So, you know I was
thinking about what you said

33:58.100 --> 34:00.300
about who am I?

34:00.300 --> 34:03.820
I don't know the answer
to that, but I don't know

34:03.820 --> 34:05.020
a whole lot about myself.

34:05.020 --> 34:07.050
I was in foster care and my parents

34:07.050 --> 34:10.150
just left me and disappeared.

34:10.150 --> 34:13.060
- Your parents did not
disappear, they were killed.

34:14.032 --> 34:15.620
- They were killed?

34:16.469 --> 34:17.969
- And the rest of your family.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.690
The Wing Chun blood line is one of

34:20.690 --> 34:22.170
the seven Warrior bloodlines.

34:22.170 --> 34:24.250
Your Great Great Grandmother, Wing Chun,

34:24.250 --> 34:27.420
she was the first woman to
create a Martial system of combat

34:27.420 --> 34:28.830
in the Earthly realm.

34:28.830 --> 34:30.380
You should know this by now.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.929
- Why would I know that?

34:32.929 --> 34:37.300
I was never told about where
I came from or who I was.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.719
I didn't even know I
had Chinese ancestors!

34:39.719 --> 34:41.620
It's not like that's physically obvious!

34:41.620 --> 34:43.870
- The only thing that
is physically obvious

34:43.870 --> 34:45.150
is how weak you are.

34:46.070 --> 34:49.739
Your body structure is
bone thin, flimsy even.

34:49.739 --> 34:50.639
Disappointing.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.010
- Alright, alright enough of that!

34:52.010 --> 34:54.690
I'm not gonna have you body shaming me.

34:54.690 --> 34:57.480
My feminist side is
about to get real buddy,

34:57.480 --> 34:59.000
put the knife down!

34:59.000 --> 35:02.500
Okay alright we can just
stop that right now please.

35:02.500 --> 35:07.035
Just put it down, okay,
alright, don't do that please.

35:07.035 --> 35:10.268
Put it down, put it down.

35:10.268 --> 35:11.271
- Silence.

35:11.271 --> 35:12.533
- I'm not gonna stay silent!

35:12.533 --> 35:14.130
- I said silence!

35:14.130 --> 35:15.573
She's coming!

35:15.573 --> 35:16.853
- Who's coming?

35:16.853 --> 35:18.773
- Your grandmother!

36:35.451 --> 36:36.990
- You're standing in my shadow.

36:36.990 --> 36:37.980
- Sorry Madam.

38:45.270 --> 38:49.103
- The Mortal Realm has
made you soft Tai Fong.

41:28.420 --> 41:31.040
- Maybe you're not a total disgrace.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.800
- I have brought you something.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.000
- A bag of plum cherries from
the Earthly Realm I hope.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.930
- I forgot to pick them
while I was fending off

41:47.930 --> 41:49.570
the demon banshees.

41:49.570 --> 41:52.320
- Well, we can't all be heroes.

41:52.320 --> 41:54.490
- I will not fail you again.

41:54.490 --> 41:55.740
- And what is this?

41:56.830 --> 42:00.040
- This is your great granddaughter.

42:00.040 --> 42:00.873
- This?

42:02.580 --> 42:04.530
Why have you not yet cut off her arm?

42:04.530 --> 42:06.910
And why is she dressed
like a brothel girl?

42:06.910 --> 42:09.100
- This is how they dress
in the Earthly Realm.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.990
This is a school uniform!

42:10.990 --> 42:12.510
- Then why is she here?

42:12.510 --> 42:14.040
- Her life is in danger.

42:14.040 --> 42:17.340
We confirmed today, she is
the last remaining survivor.

42:19.690 --> 42:20.670
- Then it is time.

42:20.670 --> 42:22.290
Do not fail me Tai Fong.

42:23.450 --> 42:24.283
- Understood.

42:25.590 --> 42:28.136
- Hey okay wait a minute,
you have no right--

42:28.136 --> 42:29.840
- I have no right?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.917
What do you think this is?

42:31.917 --> 42:33.774
Do you want to live?

42:33.774 --> 42:34.607
- Yes.

42:34.607 --> 42:37.736
- Do you want everyone you
know and care about to live?

42:37.736 --> 42:40.030
- Yes.

42:40.030 --> 42:42.010
- Then let me make one thing clear.

42:42.010 --> 42:44.960
We are in the middle of a 500-year-old war

42:44.960 --> 42:47.560
and the only way we win this
war is by keeping you alive

42:47.560 --> 42:50.350
and we will do so by any means necessary.

42:50.350 --> 42:52.800
And because you are choosing
to disobey my command

42:52.800 --> 42:55.340
that makes you a prisoner of war.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.173
Understood?

42:58.930 --> 42:59.930
Take her away.

43:21.779 --> 43:24.120
- That's all I can forage for tonight.

43:29.560 --> 43:34.560
So, what might we be eating?

43:38.920 --> 43:41.540
Okay I'm not trying to be
rude, or make things worse

43:41.540 --> 43:43.370
for myself, but I'm starving.

43:43.370 --> 43:45.320
I haven't eaten all day!

43:45.320 --> 43:48.320
And I'm pretty sure it's a
standard to feed your prisoners?

43:48.320 --> 43:49.700
I'm assuming it's a standard.

43:49.700 --> 43:52.410
- 16 years of age and you can't even

43:52.410 --> 43:54.920
retrieve your own sustenance?

43:54.920 --> 43:56.950
- What like forage for food or hunt?

43:56.950 --> 43:59.390
- Your kind makes no
effort to be accountable,

43:59.390 --> 44:01.580
even for your own survival!

44:01.580 --> 44:04.590
- It's way more
complicated than that okay.

44:04.590 --> 44:09.010
We have farmers that do the
crop growing and animal raising,

44:09.010 --> 44:11.400
and we go to super markets
and there's managers

44:11.400 --> 44:12.850
that stock the place up.

44:12.850 --> 44:15.560
And we go out, get jobs
so we can earn money

44:15.560 --> 44:17.070
to pay for the food.

44:17.070 --> 44:18.850
- That is complicated.

44:18.850 --> 44:21.140
Much more complicated than digging a hole

44:21.140 --> 44:22.460
and planting a seed.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.020
- I grew carrots once.

44:25.742 --> 44:28.740
But they turned out all
gnarled and kind of gross.

44:28.740 --> 44:30.900
Plus, I don't have time.

44:30.900 --> 44:33.330
- Ah and what do you do
with this lack of time?

44:33.330 --> 44:34.170
- You saw it.

44:34.170 --> 44:36.900
I have a job, and I got to school.

44:36.900 --> 44:40.090
I'm a waitress, I feed people
and then take their money.

44:40.090 --> 44:41.590
- Do you find that meaningful?

44:43.924 --> 44:45.520
- I don't know I guess.

44:45.520 --> 44:47.170
At least I get paid for doing it.

44:49.690 --> 44:52.340
- Money won't get you anywhere
in the Immortal Realm.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.810
- I have questions and
I need them answered.

45:12.810 --> 45:13.730
- As you should.

45:14.580 --> 45:16.210
- Hey!

45:16.210 --> 45:17.640
Tai Fong told me what you did.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.010
Thank you so much for saving my life.

45:20.010 --> 45:21.110
- Oh, it was nothing.

45:21.110 --> 45:24.370
All Japh did was turn a cash
register into a time machine.

45:24.370 --> 45:27.390
And Sari and I held off about
a thousand demon banshees.

45:27.390 --> 45:30.260
Right Sari, it was about a thousand?

45:30.260 --> 45:33.010
- I don't know I'd say about 10 thousand.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.610
- How are you?

45:35.610 --> 45:37.490
- Good. Good.

45:37.490 --> 45:40.600
It hurt for a while, but it's better now.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.190
But I just learned that
I'm a prisoner apparently.

45:44.190 --> 45:47.070
Along with being sentenced to
getting my arm chopped off.

45:47.070 --> 45:49.460
So, there's that.

45:49.460 --> 45:51.490
- Oh, so you met Grandmother.

45:51.490 --> 45:54.430
- Yes and she is so not
grandmotherly at all.

45:54.430 --> 45:56.690
I mean not at all.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.430
- Well, she's just looking out for you.

46:01.524 --> 46:03.350
- How is that even remotely possible?

46:03.350 --> 46:04.650
Ever since I met you characters

46:04.650 --> 46:07.600
it's like I unlocked the
comic con dungeon of Hell.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.770
- That bad huh?

46:08.770 --> 46:10.780
- Yeah, that's understating it.

46:10.780 --> 46:12.780
- Well, if it makes you feel better,

46:12.780 --> 46:14.740
Tai Fong isn't exactly gonna--

46:14.740 --> 46:16.050
- TMI Japh!

46:16.050 --> 46:17.410
Hold up on the info train!

46:17.410 --> 46:20.030
- Yeah, shut up.

46:20.030 --> 46:21.890
- See that's what I'm talking about.

46:21.890 --> 46:25.510
You all are full of dark secrets.

46:25.510 --> 46:28.340
Like maybe you save my
life a couple times,

46:28.340 --> 46:31.180
but it could be for some
deep dark sinister purpose.

46:31.180 --> 46:32.960
Plus, I really like my arm.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.970
This is my favorite arm.

46:34.970 --> 46:37.178
- Okay, let me rephrase.

46:37.178 --> 46:38.011
- Shh.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.859
- Would you--
- Shh.

46:40.859 --> 46:41.692
- Would--

46:44.560 --> 46:47.641
- You guys I'm asking her a question.

46:47.641 --> 46:49.910
I can do that, I can ask a question.

46:51.430 --> 46:56.430
Would you give up your arm for
everyone you know and love?

46:56.440 --> 47:00.610
Would you sacrifice your
arm to save everyone

47:00.610 --> 47:01.940
you know and love?

47:03.028 --> 47:05.400
- Of course, I'd give up my arm.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.340
I'd give my life.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.650
- Spoken like a true warrior.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.930
- Everyone in the Mortal
Realm has something

47:18.930 --> 47:20.840
of deep and personal value.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.010
Something that they would
be willing to protect

47:23.010 --> 47:24.340
and do anything for.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.610
It's part of the human existence.

47:27.610 --> 47:30.920
These demon banshees, they
exist for the sole purpose

47:30.920 --> 47:33.260
of destroying the fabric
of human experience.

47:35.450 --> 47:37.130
- The Mortal Realm must
always have warriors

47:37.130 --> 47:39.086
to protect the innocent.

47:39.086 --> 47:41.320
And you are part of a genetic
network that is ancient

47:41.320 --> 47:45.030
and specifically designed to
protect the human experience.

47:45.030 --> 47:46.920
Banshees target your kind.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.120
- Wing Chun's bloodline.

47:49.844 --> 47:51.030
Your bloodline, has suffered a holocaust.

47:52.220 --> 47:54.150
- Well how do we restore the bloodline?

47:54.150 --> 47:56.670
And how do we stop the banshees?

47:56.670 --> 47:58.766
- These are loaded
questions that unfortunately

47:58.766 --> 48:00.940
we cannot answer.

48:00.940 --> 48:03.330
- But what we can tell you is
that everything will be better

48:03.330 --> 48:05.740
after you let Tai Fong cut off your arm.

48:05.740 --> 48:07.920
- What, why?

48:07.920 --> 48:10.904
- Remember, you said you'd
sacrifice your own arm,

48:10.904 --> 48:14.230
even your life to save the ones you love.

48:14.230 --> 48:16.470
- But why does it have to be my arm?

48:16.470 --> 48:19.880
Why not his arm?

48:19.880 --> 48:21.530
- Here let me show you something.

48:25.588 --> 48:27.460
- Is that the cash register from my work?

48:27.460 --> 48:28.630
- Um yeah.

51:12.283 --> 51:13.908
- Please, please!

51:13.908 --> 51:16.846
I've been babysitting
him since he was a baby.

51:16.846 --> 51:18.665
What do I have to do to save him Japh?

51:18.665 --> 51:19.498
Please!

51:20.550 --> 51:22.440
- You already know what you have to do.

51:40.150 --> 51:42.170
- Sasha and the seven-year-old psychos?

51:51.106 --> 51:54.088
Oh, I don't really care
what happens to them.

51:54.088 --> 51:55.340
- You say that now but--

51:56.424 --> 51:57.341
- But what?

52:02.170 --> 52:03.003
- Never mind.

52:43.070 --> 52:44.320
- Claire, you sneaky mom.

52:51.570 --> 52:53.230
Stop, stop, stop!

52:53.230 --> 52:55.940
- Kaya they can't hurt her.

52:55.940 --> 52:58.460
They can only hurt her
if they kill you first.

52:58.460 --> 53:00.120
And we won't let that happen.

53:01.750 --> 53:03.740
- I thought they were after me?

53:03.740 --> 53:05.310
The bloodline, right?

53:05.310 --> 53:07.910
Why my friends, why Claire?

53:07.910 --> 53:09.940
We don't share a genetic code!

53:09.940 --> 53:11.400
And that's what it's all about right?

53:11.400 --> 53:13.750
This stupid bloodline!

53:13.750 --> 53:16.340
- It doesn't matter, the
banshees they clear out

53:16.340 --> 53:17.880
anyone connected to you.

53:17.880 --> 53:18.920
It's how they work.

53:18.920 --> 53:22.020
There is nothing orderly
or civil about them.

53:22.020 --> 53:24.050
They seek to destroy everyone and anything

53:24.050 --> 53:25.900
you've ever made a connection with.

53:40.356 --> 53:41.689
- What was that?

54:06.657 --> 54:08.740
- Japh take Kaya and run!

01:04:37.161 --> 01:04:38.780
- Listen!

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.370
Listen they are desperate to
end your bloodline tonight.

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:42.580
They sent a warlord!

01:05:10.638 --> 01:05:12.164
- What's going on?

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.690
- You have to let me
unlock your chi source!

01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:31.523
- Oh no!

01:05:31.523 --> 01:05:32.521
No no no no no!

01:05:32.521 --> 01:05:33.540
- Save yourself!

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.590
Save your loved ones!

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.350
- Okay do it, do it fast!

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:18.470
Hey I still have my arm.

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.000
This thing's cool.

01:06:21.401 --> 01:06:22.234
Whoa.

01:06:23.502 --> 01:06:24.760
- Now fight!

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.427
