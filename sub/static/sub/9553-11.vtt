01:21.950 --> 01:24.530
We've only had it
for a hundred years.

01:24.530 --> 01:26.540
It matches together there.

01:26.540 --> 01:27.450
Oh, boy.

01:27.790 --> 01:29.370
Mom, it's two weeks
before Christmas.

01:29.370 --> 01:31.120
Why are we getting the tree now?

01:31.340 --> 01:32.930
Well, your father
found a bargain.

01:32.930 --> 01:34.680
We're just going to decorate
the house.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.460
Oh, Marion, we got a beauty!

01:37.460 --> 01:38.800
Much better than last year.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.680
I hope you can get
it in the door.

01:41.050 --> 01:42.140
Yeah, yeah, we got it.

01:42.140 --> 01:43.020
All right, Richie, now you

01:43.270 --> 01:44.300
lift it high.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.220
Now, on the count
of three, Richie,

01:46.560 --> 01:47.610
I'm going to pull
it through.

01:47.970 --> 01:50.780
Are you ready?
One, two, three.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.780
Attaboy, Richie.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.200
How did you, uh...?

01:57.570 --> 01:58.650
Want some popcorn, Dad?

01:59.070 --> 02:00.150
No.

02:00.150 --> 02:02.160
Are you eating again?
Yeah.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.160
Marion, lend me hand
with this, will you?

02:04.160 --> 02:05.160
Yes, dear.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.660
What is the matter with him?

02:06.660 --> 02:09.160
He's been acting
so strange lately.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.660
Maybe it's the fluoride
in the water.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.390
MARION:
It must be another
girl problem.

02:15.590 --> 02:17.670
Marion, I think
maybe I ought to

02:17.670 --> 02:19.670
have a talk with
Richard alone, huh?

02:19.670 --> 02:21.670
Come on, Joanie, upstairs.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.680
I bet Ginny Picalow
knows all of this.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.480
How am I ever going
to become an adult?

02:25.680 --> 02:28.260
The same way I did,
very slowly.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.770
Aw...

02:30.180 --> 02:31.770
Richard.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.990
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

02:36.270 --> 02:37.860
Mm. Sure, Dad.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.240
Listen, uh,

02:41.580 --> 02:43.160
there's a rumor
going around

02:43.160 --> 02:45.000
that you've got
a crush on somebody.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.330
Oh, brother!

02:47.330 --> 02:48.840
Why does everybody
always have to dig around

02:48.840 --> 02:50.340
in my personal affairs?

02:50.340 --> 02:53.340
You know, there are some things
that are private to a guy, Dad.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.840
Okay, just forget about it.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.340
No, you brought it up,
you've got to hear about it.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.350
Dad, I got to tell
you about this.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.130
This thing is
driving me bananas.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.190
I can see that.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.440
Oh, Dad, I fell in love.

03:09.720 --> 03:10.640
Well, that's normal.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.480
I fell in love with a poster.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.310
Oh that's not normal,
that's craziness!

03:15.530 --> 03:18.530
Oh, that's not crazy--

03:18.870 --> 03:20.450
that is beautiful.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.450
The Wisconsin
Cola Girl, huh?

03:23.450 --> 03:24.820
Hey, where did you meet her?

03:25.150 --> 03:26.570
I haven't.

03:26.820 --> 03:30.410
Oh, now I know why you've
been eating so much lately.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.910
I went through
the same thing once.

03:32.910 --> 03:34.880
One summer I gained 14 pounds

03:34.880 --> 03:36.920
when I fell in love
with Jean Harlow.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.750
Dad, you fell in love
with Jean Harlow?
Yeah.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.140
And you thought
about her all the time?

03:41.550 --> 03:42.470
All the time.

03:42.470 --> 03:43.470
And you even dreamt about her?

03:43.810 --> 03:44.890
Even dreamt about her.

03:45.390 --> 03:46.390
Did you wake up
all tense?

03:46.390 --> 03:47.390
None of your business.

03:47.810 --> 03:52.400
Dad, Dad, just let me tell
you about my dream.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.400
I know that
dream, Richard.

03:54.770 --> 03:56.850
No, no, I am not talking
about that, Dad.

03:57.350 --> 04:00.360
See, the dream goes like this.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.830
She's the way she is
in the poster here, see,

04:02.830 --> 04:06.860
and I come up to her,
and she says, "Hiya, handsome.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.360
Where have you been
all my life?"

04:08.360 --> 04:09.870
See, and then I begin
to answer her...

04:10.280 --> 04:13.370
(imitating Humphrey Bogart):
I've been waiting
for you, sweetheart.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.700
(normal voice):
Humphrey Bogart.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.790
Yeah, that's good, Dad,
but that's not what I say.

04:17.010 --> 04:17.589
No?

04:18.010 --> 04:19.040
See, that's my problem.

04:19.589 --> 04:20.540
I don't know what I say.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.600
In the dream, I always wake up

04:22.600 --> 04:24.600
right before I'm about
to-to tell her some great line,

04:24.600 --> 04:27.380
and just once, I'd like to hear
what it is I say to her.

04:27.720 --> 04:33.310
Richard, your problem
is not an unusual one.

04:33.310 --> 04:35.310
I mean, you shouldn't
be embarrassed about it.

04:35.310 --> 04:36.810
Everybody has dreams.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.810
Listen, why don't you talk it
over with your friends.

04:38.810 --> 04:40.610
They're not going
to laugh at you.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.700
(laughing)

04:43.950 --> 04:45.990
Cunningham,
are you serious?

04:45.990 --> 04:48.040
I mean, having dreams
about a poster?

04:48.040 --> 04:49.990
(laughing)

04:50.370 --> 04:52.960
It's a dream, Fonz.
Didn't you ever have dreams?

04:52.960 --> 04:53.830
Hey, wait a minute,
Cunningham.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.160
I am not a dreamer.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.050
I am the dreamee.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.470
She's so beautiful.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.920
She's so beautiful, I can't
get her out of my mind.

05:05.310 --> 05:07.390
I'll tell you something,
I cannot believe this.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.390
After all these years
of training,

05:09.390 --> 05:11.390
you've fallen in love
with a poster.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.400
It's unnatural, I'm telling
you, Rich, it's unnatural.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.400
What do you want to do, get
married, have little postcards?

05:21.100 --> 05:23.020
So beautiful.
Cunningham,
Cunningham...

05:23.360 --> 05:25.940
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.440
She's so beautiful.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.450
Speak, beautiful.

05:31.450 --> 05:33.450
Yeah, of course
it's on for tonight.

05:33.450 --> 05:34.830
Yeah, of course
I'm still ticklish.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.200
(coin clinking in slot)
Oh.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.710
Okay, so the thing is...

05:41.710 --> 05:44.710
you can't do that
with a poster,

05:44.710 --> 05:46.210
you understand what
I'm talking about?

05:46.210 --> 05:49.020
You got to go for
real chicks, huh, huh?

05:51.300 --> 05:53.270
Look at her, Fonz.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.190
This already is not bad.

05:55.190 --> 05:58.190
All right, all right, all right,
that's okay, all right,

05:58.190 --> 05:59.690
she's a very pretty girl,

05:59.690 --> 06:03.700
but, uh, see pictures don't tell
you everything you want to know,

06:03.700 --> 06:06.070
like what about her head?
She might be an empty noodle.

06:06.070 --> 06:08.900
No, no. No chance of that.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.240
She finished top ten
in her class.
Uh-huh?

06:11.240 --> 06:14.120
All right, all right, so
she's not an empty noodle.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.630
All right, she's
a smart chick, right?
Yeah.

06:15.630 --> 06:17.630
Let me tell you something
about smart chicks--

06:17.630 --> 06:18.630
dull, very, very dull.

06:18.630 --> 06:21.630
Well, in this
article here...

06:21.630 --> 06:23.630
says she likes swimming,

06:23.630 --> 06:26.090
horseback riding,
and motorcycles.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.510
She likes motorcycles.

06:30.510 --> 06:31.890
It's hopeless, huh?

06:31.890 --> 06:33.230
No, wait a minute,
I'll find something,

06:33.230 --> 06:34.730
I'll find something,
just wait a minute.

06:34.730 --> 06:36.230
All right, all right,

06:36.230 --> 06:38.230
from the waist up she looks
like Jayne Mansfield, right?

06:38.230 --> 06:40.230
She sure does.

06:40.230 --> 06:41.730
What about from
the waist down?

06:41.730 --> 06:42.690
She could be Daffy Duck.

06:42.690 --> 06:46.610
What are you, a
walking scrapbook?

06:49.030 --> 06:50.410
Huh?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.910
Uh-huh. All right,
all right,

06:51.910 --> 06:54.360
I've got one more piece
of advice for you, Rich.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.420
Whatever you do--
lie, cheat, steal--

06:56.420 --> 06:58.420
you meet this chick! This
is no Daffy Duck here!

07:05.120 --> 07:07.630
(door opens, then closes)

07:07.630 --> 07:09.130
A lot of traffic downtown.

07:09.130 --> 07:10.130
Where have you been?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.130
We had to drive three blocks

07:11.130 --> 07:13.130
before I found a meter
with some time left on it.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.130
I would have
given you a penny.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.140
Where's Potsie?

07:16.140 --> 07:17.140
He'll be right up.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.640
They made him use
the service entrance.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.640
Oh, great.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.640
All right, all right,
now listen.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.640
We've got to try
and fool this guy,

07:23.640 --> 07:25.650
so I can get my poster
girl's telephone number.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.150
Right.
We've got to
pretend like...

07:27.150 --> 07:30.120
(intercom buzzes)
we're sophisticated,
hardware businessmen.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.150
Exactly.
So no clowning, Ralph.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.570
Does this look like
the cigar of a clown?

07:35.990 --> 07:37.040
(door buzzes open)

07:38.570 --> 07:40.080
Thank you for seeing us.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.040
Right. J.B., want me
to shut the door?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.080
No, don't bother,
I've got it.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.080
(door hums)

07:47.580 --> 07:48.580
That's great!

07:48.580 --> 07:49.920
Can I see that again?
No.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.750
I've got to get
that for my car.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.510
All right, boys, let's get
at the business at hand.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.090
I've a modeling agency
to run here.

07:55.340 --> 07:56.930
Right, J.B.

07:56.930 --> 07:59.430
J.B., I represent

07:59.430 --> 08:01.930
the Inter-Global Advertising
Agency, and this is

08:01.930 --> 08:03.350
my very wealthy client,
Richard Cunningham III,

08:03.650 --> 08:06.020
of Cunningham
Hardware Enterprises.

08:06.190 --> 08:07.270
Aren't you boys
a little young

08:07.270 --> 08:08.270
to get involved
in business?

08:08.690 --> 08:09.570
"Young"?
(Ralph and Richie laugh)

08:10.940 --> 08:12.360
That's what they said
about Adolphe Menjou.

08:13.830 --> 08:14.910
They did?

08:14.910 --> 08:15.830
J.B., we have
an idea here,

08:16.250 --> 08:18.830
and we think it could be big.

08:18.830 --> 08:19.830
Now, you've no doubt heard

08:19.830 --> 08:21.700
of the Cunningham Hardware
chain?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.090
I can't say that I have.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.590
You haven't?

08:24.590 --> 08:25.590
Well, really, B.J....

08:26.010 --> 08:26.840
J.B.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.590
J.B., right.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.960
See, the reason you
haven't heard of us

08:34.960 --> 08:36.470
is because
we're a secret.

08:36.470 --> 08:37.970
Can I see that
door trick again?

08:37.970 --> 08:39.970
Ah, leave my button alone.

08:39.970 --> 08:40.970
Right. Show him
the map, R.C.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.440
Right.
Look at this map.

08:45.470 --> 08:46.980
See all the dots here?

08:46.980 --> 08:48.980
They represent
future locations

08:48.980 --> 08:51.310
of Cunningham Hardware stores
throughout the world.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.650
Hmm. What are these,
uh, red lines?

08:54.650 --> 08:56.490
Oh, those are the
voyages of Magellan.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.540
Very interesting...
interesting.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.710
Magellan?

09:01.910 --> 09:02.990
You see, the
Cunninghams were

09:02.990 --> 09:06.000
the first family to sell
pliers to the Indians.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.800
That's crazy!
I know.

09:08.050 --> 09:09.630
That's what the Indians thought

09:09.630 --> 09:12.390
until we sold them
nuts and bolts.

09:12.670 --> 09:13.750
(chuckles):
Yeah.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.250
Well, enough history.
Right.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.260
Now, on to the business at hand.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.670
Yes, we're starting
our campaign

09:18.670 --> 09:20.260
with a big Christmas push.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.760
"Hardware for the Hubby,"
do you get it?

09:21.760 --> 09:22.730
Hmm.
Yeah.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.650
Now we've been
scouring the country,

09:24.650 --> 09:27.650
looking for the right
Mr. and Mrs. Tool.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.150
We think we've found
half of our team already.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.650
R.M.?

09:32.070 --> 09:33.160
R.M.?

09:33.570 --> 09:34.520
(mouths words)

09:34.820 --> 09:35.910
Ralph Malph!

09:36.330 --> 09:37.410
(laughs)

09:37.830 --> 09:38.860
I like that.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.410
R.M., right.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.420
J.B., R.M.

09:42.420 --> 09:44.420
Meet... Mr. Tool.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.290
(a la "Mr.Sandman"):
♪ Mr. Tool Man,
lend me a wrench ♪

09:51.290 --> 09:54.090
♪ And I'll be over to build
you a bench, yeah! ♪

09:54.290 --> 09:56.680
Let's hear it
for Mr. Tool!

09:58.050 --> 10:00.100
Credible.
Yes, we knew he'd impress you.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.600
Shall I play my saw now?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.550
Uh, that's enough,
Mr. Tool.

10:03.890 --> 10:05.470
As we were saying,

10:05.470 --> 10:07.970
we believe we've
found our Mrs. Tool

10:07.970 --> 10:09.980
right here in Milwaukee.

10:09.980 --> 10:10.890
Who is it?

10:11.190 --> 10:12.780
The Wisconsin Cola Girl.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.200
J.B.:
Angela Buvay,

10:14.480 --> 10:15.560
a very busy girl.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.570
Won't be available
for a couple of months.

10:17.570 --> 10:18.570
She won't?

10:18.570 --> 10:20.040
Well listen,
J.B., uh...

10:20.040 --> 10:21.570
couldn't you just
bring her up here

10:21.570 --> 10:23.070
and let us meet
her, you know?

10:23.070 --> 10:25.710
Uh, well, we came
all this way,

10:25.990 --> 10:27.080
and, and she's,
she's so beautiful.

10:27.580 --> 10:28.580
I've got to meet
Angela Buvay.

10:28.580 --> 10:29.500
Okay, Richard.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.380
Richard, look,
we have no choice.

10:32.380 --> 10:34.380
We're just going to
have to go with Bess.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.890
Bess? I'm not posing
with Bess Truman.

10:37.890 --> 10:40.760
Bess Myerson,
you tool chest.
Oh.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.510
The former Miss America?

10:43.760 --> 10:44.840
We're just going
to have to pay

10:44.840 --> 10:45.850
whatever she wants;
the sky's the limit.

10:46.260 --> 10:47.350
Ooh, we'll pay it.

10:47.350 --> 10:49.350
(door hums)

10:51.070 --> 10:52.570
Does this mean
you've reconsidered?

10:52.900 --> 10:54.440
That's the idea.
When do you want to see her?

10:54.820 --> 10:57.410
Tonight.
She won't be
available till 10:00.

10:57.410 --> 10:58.410
She's on her fifth day

10:58.410 --> 11:00.280
of her five-day deodorant
commercial.

11:00.530 --> 11:03.110
Oh. Well, uh...

11:03.110 --> 11:04.110
No, that,
that'll be fine.

11:04.610 --> 11:06.120
Just have her come
after the commercial.

11:06.120 --> 11:10.120
Have her come to
2815 Lake Avenue.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.420
That's Arnold's.
That's Arnold's.
Shh!

11:11.620 --> 11:12.710
RICHIE:
Thank you very much, J.B.

11:12.710 --> 11:13.670
RALPH:
Okay, right, J.B.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.170
After you, boss.

11:15.170 --> 11:17.090
Hey, wait, wait--
wait a minute, guys.

11:17.090 --> 11:19.180
You promised me if I got
in this stupid outfit,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.680
I could finish my song.
I've got two verses left.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.680
Okay, Pots.
Don't worry.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.180
You'll sing. Just stand
right over here.

11:24.180 --> 11:26.190
This is my big chance, guys.
Let him see you.

11:26.190 --> 11:27.190
You ready? Okay.
Sing.

11:27.190 --> 11:28.190
Here goes.

11:28.190 --> 11:30.020

11:42.400 --> 11:44.320
RICHIE:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Uh, well, yeah{\r}.</font></font></i>

11:44.650 --> 11:47.240
Yeah, I just thought I'd go out
and get some fresh air.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.130
(breathes deeply)

11:49.410 --> 11:51.490
Good, good.

11:51.490 --> 11:53.300
You going to take
a picture of it?

11:53.500 --> 11:56.580
Oh, no, I'm not...

11:56.580 --> 11:58.580
Oh, well, yeah.
Yeah, see, I just thought

11:58.580 --> 12:00.590
I'd take a couple of
night shots, that's all.

12:00.590 --> 12:01.890
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you, Dad,

12:02.050 --> 12:03.640
Okay, Richard?
Hmm?

12:04.140 --> 12:07.140
Before you drive all the way
down to Arnold's, uh...

12:07.590 --> 12:10.980
I think you should know about
the call I got from Angela.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.820
Angela called you?

12:14.820 --> 12:16.320
Do you think that
tree is straight?

12:16.320 --> 12:17.820
Yeah, yeah,
it looks fine.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.820
What did Angela say, Dad?

12:18.820 --> 12:20.320
No, it's a little
to the left.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.660
Dad, will you tell
me what she said?

12:21.910 --> 12:24.490
Oh, well,
she just, uh, called

12:24.910 --> 12:26.860
to check on
why the address

12:27.160 --> 12:30.700
you gave her
was for a drive-in.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.750
Oh.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.750
So I guess you told her.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.760
Yeah, I told her.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.710
I told her
it was a subsidiary

12:39.710 --> 12:42.130
of Cunningham Hardware
Enterprises.

12:44.510 --> 12:46.520
No kidding?
Uh-huh.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.470
You did that for me?

12:47.880 --> 12:49.470
I did that for you,

12:49.470 --> 12:51.470
and I did that
for Jean Harlow and me.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.440
But don't tell your mother.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.440
Aw, thanks, Dad.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.450
(instrumental "Deck the Halls"
playing)

13:04.870 --> 13:06.870
All right, girls,
all right, hey, hey,

13:06.870 --> 13:07.870
we're gonna take
a picture now,

13:07.870 --> 13:09.660
both of you on my lap,
over here, come on.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.960
Fonz, what's going
on here?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.960
What are you
doing here?
Now wait a
minute, Red.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.960
I know that you're gonna
take a picture of the
poster girl here,

13:16.960 --> 13:18.710
I figured maybe you could
help me out with my
Christmas cards.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.050
But she's gonna be here
any minute.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.470
You've got to be kidding,
Fonz, I...

13:21.470 --> 13:23.420
Hey, hey, hey,
I only need one shot.

13:23.420 --> 13:26.170
It's my Yuletide obligation.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.920
All right, all right,
let's just do it.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.230
Let's do it fast
and get it over with.

13:29.230 --> 13:31.090
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
where's Al?

13:31.090 --> 13:32.930
Where's Al? Al,

13:32.930 --> 13:34.760
get out here!

13:39.270 --> 13:41.270
(bell ringing)

13:41.270 --> 13:43.270
Hi, Richie.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.440
Why an elf?

13:47.440 --> 13:49.910
They were all out
of Santa Claus suits.

13:49.910 --> 13:52.920
It was either this
or a gorilla outfit.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.780
All right, all right, we gonna
have a party or we gonna

13:54.780 --> 13:56.670
take a picture?
We're taking a picture,
right, okay?

13:56.670 --> 13:58.170
Everybody, smile your brains
out. Here we go.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.370
RICHIE:
Okay, all right.

13:59.370 --> 14:00.710
Great, we got it.

14:00.710 --> 14:02.210
It's fine. Everybody go.

14:02.210 --> 14:04.040
FONZIE:
All right, girls, take it
easy. Thanks very much.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.350
You'll get you Christmas bonus
on Wednesday,

14:06.350 --> 14:08.350
you'll get your Christmas bonus
on Thursday,

14:08.350 --> 14:10.850
you'll get your Christmas bonus
on Friday and Saturday,

14:11.350 --> 14:12.350
'cause you're so lovely, yeah.

14:12.350 --> 14:15.300
It's all yours, Richie,
it's all yours.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.360
Well, Richie,

14:17.360 --> 14:19.310
I guess I'll go change
my clothes now, okay?

14:19.310 --> 14:21.860
Oh, no, no, there's
no time for that, Al.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.860
Wait, I've got a
blind date tonight.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.870
Oh, well, uh,
girls love elves.

14:26.870 --> 14:29.120
She'll think you're
a real fun date.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.400
You're sure?
Yeah.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.400
Maybe I should have rented
the gorilla outfit.

14:32.910 --> 14:33.910
(growling)
Yeah.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.410
Next time, Al,
next time.

14:35.410 --> 14:37.410
Yeah.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.910
All right, there's a car
just pulled up.

14:39.910 --> 14:40.910
A car!
Yeah.

14:40.910 --> 14:42.410
That's probably Angela!

14:42.410 --> 14:44.420
Fonz, you know, I don't even
know what I'm gonna say yet.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.420
She's here; I don't know
what I'm gonna say to her!

14:46.420 --> 14:47.420
(snaps fingers)

14:47.420 --> 14:48.750
Yeah?

14:48.750 --> 14:50.560
The first thing
you do is relax.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.310
(deep exhale)
Right.

14:52.310 --> 14:53.590
Sounds good,
sounds good.

14:53.590 --> 14:55.590
The next thing you do
is you listen to me,

14:55.590 --> 14:57.100
'cause I've figured out
what you're gonna say

14:57.100 --> 14:59.060
when she says, "Where have
you been all my life?"

14:59.060 --> 15:01.430
Oh, Fonz, you came
through for me.

15:01.430 --> 15:02.850
When don't I?

15:02.850 --> 15:04.350
And I wrote it down.

15:04.350 --> 15:05.350
Hi...

15:05.350 --> 15:06.320
I'm Angela.

15:08.610 --> 15:11.030
Hi, I'm Angela.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.280
Hi, I'm Angela.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.080
Right.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.090
Hi, I'm R.C.

15:20.090 --> 15:22.090
I'm A.F.

15:22.090 --> 15:23.870
I'm the photographer.

15:23.870 --> 15:25.620
Oh, well, then he must
be Mr. Tool.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.630
Aaayyh!

15:27.630 --> 15:30.630
No, no, he's my
finest copywriter.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.630
ANGELA: Oh.
Thanks for the
new slogan, A.F.

15:32.630 --> 15:35.630
Right, I hope it
works for you, R.C.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.640
Angela, I'm charmed.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.640
Whoa.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.640
What an unusual place
to, uh, meet.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.980
Yeah, well, uh, we're
going for the teen market.

15:48.980 --> 15:51.150
Hardware?

15:51.150 --> 15:52.990
Well, yeah.

15:52.990 --> 15:54.990
Yeah, kids love chains,

15:54.990 --> 15:57.290
and-and crowbars.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.540
That's very interesting.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.380
Hey, you even do
your own camera work.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.160
Mm-hmm.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.630
Well, is this the type
of lighting

16:06.630 --> 16:08.170
you're gonna use?

16:08.170 --> 16:09.670
Uh, yeah... yeah.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.670
Oh, you probably use
that fast film.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.560
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the fastest, uh,

16:13.560 --> 16:17.180
Japanese film, Kodako.

16:17.180 --> 16:20.010
Okay.

16:20.010 --> 16:21.930
How do you want me?

16:25.230 --> 16:27.100
To pose!

16:27.100 --> 16:28.740
Pose?

16:28.740 --> 16:30.990
Well, J.B. said

16:30.990 --> 16:32.990
that I would be
Mrs. Tool,

16:32.990 --> 16:34.990
so, uh...

16:35.490 --> 16:37.860
I thought I
would try this.

16:39.030 --> 16:40.700
What do you think?

16:40.700 --> 16:43.420
I love you.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.510
What?

16:46.510 --> 16:49.380
Uh, uh, no, it-it.
Uh, I-I love it,

16:49.380 --> 16:51.380
and yes and I-I love
my profession,

16:51.380 --> 16:53.380
and you look wonderful.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.180
How do you want me to pose?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.930
Huh?

16:56.930 --> 16:57.850
Hey,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.300
I've got a great idea.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.810
Uh, how about if I get
on top of the booth,

17:02.810 --> 17:04.310
with the pennants
behind me, okay?

17:05.810 --> 17:07.780
How's this?

17:08.640 --> 17:10.150
Oh, that's terrific.

17:12.150 --> 17:13.980
You didn't take the picture.

17:13.980 --> 17:15.819
Oh, yeah, right, I will.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.740
Okay,

17:17.740 --> 17:20.160
um, how about if I do,

17:20.160 --> 17:22.990
uh, something like, uh, this?

17:22.990 --> 17:24.790
Hardware.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.630
Hardware.

17:31.380 --> 17:34.250
Would you like me to move
or something?

17:34.250 --> 17:36.510
That's a great idea.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.840
Okay, uh,

17:39.840 --> 17:43.350
how about if I try, uh,
something like this?

17:43.350 --> 17:44.850
Oh, yeah.

17:44.850 --> 17:46.350
And, uh, this.

17:46.350 --> 17:47.350
Oh, I got that one.

17:47.350 --> 17:49.350
And this?
That's great.

17:49.350 --> 17:50.350
And, uh, this?

17:50.350 --> 17:51.350
Looks beautiful.

17:51.350 --> 17:52.820
And wouldn't it work better

17:52.820 --> 17:54.690
if you took the lens cap
off the camera?

17:55.570 --> 17:57.580
Yeah.

17:59.030 --> 18:01.080
Yeah, well, um,

18:01.080 --> 18:04.370
I think I've taken enough shots
with the lens cap on.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.090
Now we'll go for the clear look.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.840
Hey, why don't you tell me
what you want.

18:13.840 --> 18:17.510
Well, why don't you move
a little closer.

18:17.510 --> 18:19.010
Closer?
Yeah.

18:19.010 --> 18:21.020
Okay, uh, how's this?

18:21.020 --> 18:22.890
I like that.

18:22.890 --> 18:24.720
Okay, uh, and this?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.190
That's great.
And this.

18:26.190 --> 18:27.690
I got that one,
too.
Okay,

18:27.690 --> 18:29.690
I'll come over here
and how's, uh,

18:29.690 --> 18:31.190
this?
Oh, beautiful.

18:31.190 --> 18:32.190
And this.
Yeah.

18:32.190 --> 18:33.700
And this.
Oh, that's a good
picture.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.030
Okay, and I'll move
over here.

18:35.030 --> 18:35.860
I got that.
And this

18:35.860 --> 18:37.150
Oh, you look so
and I'll come

18:37.150 --> 18:38.900
forward and...
great, Angela.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.400
Hey!

18:40.400 --> 18:42.400
Are you all right?

18:42.400 --> 18:44.910
Angela, I have a
confession to make.

18:44.910 --> 18:47.410
I'm not a professional
photographer.

18:47.410 --> 18:48.740
Now that may
surprise you.

18:48.740 --> 18:50.910
Well, the lens cap was a hint,

18:50.910 --> 18:53.750
but, uh, this, uh,
cinched it.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.250
Uh, could you help me get
this tree off, please?

18:56.250 --> 18:58.250
Oh, yeah, sure.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.760
I'm not a photographer.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.770
I'm not a businessman.

19:09.770 --> 19:12.270
I'm not even R.C.

19:12.270 --> 19:15.270
I'm Richie Cunningham,
a high school senior.

19:17.270 --> 19:19.780
I fell in love
with a girl on a poster,

19:19.780 --> 19:21.610
and I had to meet that girl.

19:21.610 --> 19:26.250
You mean you went to all this
trouble just to meet me?

19:26.250 --> 19:28.030
Well, I dream about you
all the time, and I,

19:28.530 --> 19:30.540
and I think about you
in class, and I...

19:30.540 --> 19:32.540
I apologize.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.460
I'm, I'm really sorry
I loused up your whole evening.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.840
Hey, I'm not upset.

19:38.630 --> 19:41.550
Actually, I'm
very flattered.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.550
I'll just, uh,
get my things.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.050
Uh, Angela...

19:46.050 --> 19:47.390
listen.

19:47.390 --> 19:49.190
Being a model and everything,

19:49.190 --> 19:51.940
I bet you must have a million
boyfriends, right?

19:52.720 --> 19:54.730
Actually only one.

19:54.730 --> 19:57.030
I'm almost engaged.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.780
Oh.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.120
Football player?

20:02.120 --> 20:03.950
No.

20:03.950 --> 20:05.370
He's a medical student.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.660
Same thing.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.080
Well, listen, I,

20:11.080 --> 20:13.580
I don't think you should
get married too soon,

20:13.580 --> 20:16.580
'cause, you could
be Miss Wisconsin,

20:16.580 --> 20:18.470
or-or maybe even Miss America.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.390
Thank you, Richie.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.890
Bye.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.760
Richie?

20:32.810 --> 20:34.680
You know the dream
you had--

20:34.680 --> 20:36.690
is it something you
could tell me?

20:36.690 --> 20:38.690
No.

20:38.690 --> 20:40.690
I-I... well, I mean,

20:40.690 --> 20:42.690
it's too cornball,

20:42.690 --> 20:44.190
you don't even want
to hear it.

20:44.190 --> 20:45.690
Of course I want
to hear it.

20:45.690 --> 20:47.700
I'm the leading lady.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.700
Yeah, right.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.700
You promise
you won't laugh?

20:51.700 --> 20:53.700
No, I won't laugh.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.000
All right.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.790
You're the way you are in that,

20:56.790 --> 20:58.790
in that, Wisconsin Cola ad,

20:58.790 --> 21:00.260
uh, where you say...

21:00.260 --> 21:03.600
Hiya, handsome,
where you been all my life?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.460
Right?
Right, yeah.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.470
And then I say...

21:12.890 --> 21:13.890
(snaps fingers)

21:13.890 --> 21:16.890
"Hey, put one right here, baby."

21:27.070 --> 21:29.820
That doesn't, uh,
sound like you.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.740
No, that...
that's not me.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.210
No, I would say
something like, uh,

21:35.210 --> 21:38.250
"Waiting for you...

21:38.250 --> 21:40.750
and hoping...

21:40.750 --> 21:42.670
that you would kiss me."

21:48.720 --> 21:50.730
And I'd walk over to you.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.730
Touch you.

22:07.190 --> 22:08.360
That's my dream.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.530
Thank you.

22:12.450 --> 22:14.780
You're welcome.

22:14.780 --> 22:17.120
Well, I...

22:17.120 --> 22:18.950
I guess you gotta go now, huh?

22:23.130 --> 22:26.040
Yeah, I guess
I gotta go.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.460
Well, you don't have to.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.880
Yeah...

22:32.880 --> 22:35.770
I have to.

22:42.690 --> 22:44.480
Bye.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.820
Hey, hey, Angela...

22:48.820 --> 22:51.650
listen, if-if your medical
student ever gets hit

22:51.650 --> 22:52.900
by a train or anything...

22:54.570 --> 22:56.910
...why, you... you just
give me a ring, okay?

22:57.880 --> 22:59.880
You bet.

23:19.770 --> 23:22.770
I got enough shots
with the lens cap on.

23:28.270 --> 23:30.610
Was it worth it?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.360
Yeah.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.410
Well, I-I had to know.

23:35.410 --> 23:37.280
She's engaged.

23:39.170 --> 23:41.620
You got to live out
your dream, Jack.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.670
Yeah.

23:43.670 --> 23:44.670
Yeah.

23:44.670 --> 23:46.170
Yeah.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.680
Hey, uh, Red, let me ask
you a question.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.680
How would you feel

23:49.680 --> 23:51.630
about me giving your Christmas
present a little bit early?

23:51.630 --> 23:52.960
I've got it outside
in the car.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.220
Oh, that's neat, Fonz.
What'd you get me?

23:55.220 --> 23:56.640
No, no, not what.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.140
The question is, who?

23:58.140 --> 23:59.970
I got you
the Polaski twins.

23:59.970 --> 24:01.810
Oh.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.360
No, I-I don't
think so,

24:03.360 --> 24:04.810
Polaski twins
tonight, Fonz.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.780
Let me tell you
something, Cunningham.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.780
You know, if you
fall off a bike--

24:08.780 --> 24:11.780
as I hear
some people do--

24:13.790 --> 24:15.290
...if you don't get
right back on it,

24:15.290 --> 24:17.210
you start driving
DeSotos.

24:17.210 --> 24:19.120
Yeah.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.130
Yeah, but I just don't
think after Angela...

24:22.130 --> 24:23.460
Richie...

24:23.460 --> 24:25.800
you want to date a DeSoto
type all your life?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.300
No.
No.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.800
No, you're right, Fonz.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
Let's go.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.300
Let's go, Fonz.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.310
Oh, wait, wait
a minute, uh,

24:33.310 --> 24:34.810
you're on your
own, laddie.

24:34.810 --> 24:36.140
They're all for you.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.430
Me?

24:37.430 --> 24:38.390
Both. The...

24:38.390 --> 24:40.260
That's right.
Merry Christmas.

24:40.260 --> 24:42.180
No, no, no, I can't
handle both, Fonz.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.680
No.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.980
No.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.850
You're sure?
Yeah, I'm positive.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.150
All right, then
I'll go with you.

24:48.150 --> 24:48.990
But I get Linda.

24:48.990 --> 24:50.270
What's the difference?

24:50.270 --> 24:51.240
They're identical twins.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.190
You're gonna learn, oh,
are you gonna learn!
