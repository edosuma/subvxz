_

01:09.300 --> 01:12.260
Baboons, you gotta come down.

01:12.310 --> 01:15.240
- It's not safe up there.
- We're dry up here.

01:16.540 --> 01:19.140
We'll come down
when the rain stops.

01:19.180 --> 01:23.190
- This guy's un-Bunga-lievable.
- Oh, baboons.

01:26.250 --> 01:29.150
Kion. The tree's gonna go.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.530
And I don't wanna go with it.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.200
Calm down!
As long as we stay dry,

01:38.230 --> 01:40.140
whoo-whoo,
everything will be fine.

01:40.170 --> 01:42.470
No, it won't. Your tree's
about to fall off a cliff.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.230
He's right. Look.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.380
No! Stay on this side
of the tree!

01:51.210 --> 01:55.180
Can't hold it much longer.

01:56.380 --> 01:57.380
<i> Harpana!</i>

01:59.390 --> 02:01.260
I got to get him
out of that tree.

02:01.290 --> 02:04.160
Beshte! Think you can take
a little more weight?

02:05.430 --> 02:09.100
Sure. But whatever
you're gonna do, do it fast.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.400
Bunga, climb up there and
scare those baboons down.

02:12.430 --> 02:16.400
<i>With pleasure! Zuka zama!</i>

02:18.410 --> 02:21.180
Okay, baboonies,
you can thank me later.

02:21.210 --> 02:22.340
Ah.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.450
I got you.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.260
Come on outta there, baboonie.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.530
Whoa.

02:44.570 --> 02:47.200
Oh. You can get off now.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.540
We'll get down...

02:48.570 --> 02:50.170
when the rain stops.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.500
Ugh. Baboons.

02:56.380 --> 02:59.180
Whew. I'm beat.

02:59.210 --> 03:01.410
Oh. Don't get
too comfortable.

03:01.450 --> 03:03.490
There's bound to be
another storm.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.390
Ohh, another one?

03:05.420 --> 03:08.190
We're still cleaning up
from the last one.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.420
<i>Hmm.</i>

03:09.460 --> 03:13.030
Who knew a tree full of
baboons would be so heavy?

03:15.160 --> 03:17.260
Okay, everybody take a breather.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.270
You've earned it.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.510
There you go, little guy.

03:30.140 --> 03:31.340
You're welcome.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.390
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

03:36.420 --> 03:38.320
Storm's caused
so much destruction.

03:42.190 --> 03:43.260
Grandfather?

03:46.390 --> 03:48.450
Yes, Kion. I'm here.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.260
I was thinking.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.070
The rains cause so many
problems for the Pride Lands.

03:55.100 --> 03:59.110
What if I used the Roar to
blow the big rain storms away?

04:00.310 --> 04:03.480
The rains are part of
the Circle of Life, Kion.

04:03.510 --> 04:08.050
The Pride Lands will need
that water for the dry season.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.220
I guess. But it'd be
a lot easier...

04:11.250 --> 04:14.190
Kion. The easy solution

04:14.220 --> 04:18.190
is not always
the best solution.

04:18.230 --> 04:19.290
Yes, Grandfather.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.470
Oh, no.

04:28.370 --> 04:31.170
- Beshte! Let me out!
- Hmm?

04:36.280 --> 04:38.110
It smells like fish in there.

04:38.150 --> 04:40.180
Guys, get up! Break's over!

04:40.210 --> 04:41.440
What's the kerbubble, Kion?

04:43.080 --> 04:44.180
Oh.

04:46.090 --> 04:47.490
Ah.

04:49.090 --> 04:50.390
Ah.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.150
What's going on? There's
never been a river here before.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.120
- Ono! Take a look!
- Affirmative.

04:59.130 --> 05:02.160
<i> Hapana!</i>

05:02.200 --> 05:06.270
Lake Kiziwa! It's too full.
The water's pouring out!

05:06.310 --> 05:09.310
That last rainstorm's
still causing trouble.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.380
It's getting worse, Kion!

05:16.320 --> 05:18.450
Lion Guard!
We need to do something

05:18.490 --> 05:21.160
before all that water
floods the valley.

05:22.290 --> 05:24.030
Hey, I've got an idea.

05:26.290 --> 05:29.250
Push, Beshte!
We gotta block it out!

05:29.300 --> 05:31.470
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

05:39.140 --> 05:41.647
<i>- Poa!
- We did it!</i>

05:41.682 --> 05:43.050
Nice!

05:44.210 --> 05:46.150
Oh, my!

05:46.180 --> 05:48.050
Whose idea was this?

05:48.080 --> 05:50.120
Mine. Pretty awesome, huh?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.490
Impressive.
What a great idea.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.120
And you know what
makes this a great idea?

05:55.160 --> 05:58.460
It was so simple to do.
Quick and easy.

05:58.490 --> 06:00.160
That's the way to do it.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.390
I don't know, Bunga.

06:01.430 --> 06:04.470
The easy solution's
not always the best solution.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.400
Well, it sure worked with this dam.

06:08.370 --> 06:10.170
Uh-oh. Now look at it.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.000
What do we do about that?

06:14.040 --> 06:17.350
Hmm. Put a stick in it.

06:17.380 --> 06:19.150
That's my advice.

06:19.180 --> 06:22.150
Hey, it worked.
What a good idea.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.140
He gives great advice.

06:24.190 --> 06:27.090
Good idea? Great advice?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.290
You know you're
talking about Bunga, right?

06:30.320 --> 06:32.380
Don't be so surprised.

06:32.430 --> 06:36.400
Honey badgers, they are the Pride
Lands' smartest animals when...

06:36.430 --> 06:38.400
Oh, oh, oh. Wait a minute.

06:38.430 --> 06:40.100
You hear that, everybody?

06:40.130 --> 06:42.360
I'm the Pride Lands'
smartest animal.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.260
Rafiki said so. I'm smart
and I give good advice.

06:46.310 --> 06:49.310
Say, wait till my uncles
hear about this.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.080
Hey, Bunga! Wait up!

06:54.350 --> 06:58.150
Yes, yes. Honey badgers
are the smartest

06:58.190 --> 07:00.360
when they think
before they speak.

07:00.390 --> 07:05.130
But if they do not, whoo-hoo-hoo!

07:05.160 --> 07:08.260
Total disaster!

07:08.300 --> 07:11.070
Hmm, where'd everybody go?

07:11.100 --> 07:12.400
Eh?

07:20.270 --> 07:22.370
Bunga! Bunga, wait up!

07:22.410 --> 07:25.210
<i>Um, a little help here?</i>

07:26.310 --> 07:27.470
Uh-oh.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.190
Oh, we forgot to flip the turtles.
Sorry about that.

07:33.390 --> 07:35.190
Oh, thank you.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.260
- Phew.
- There you go, little guy.

07:38.290 --> 07:43.230
- Well, the turtles are all flipped.
- We forget anything else?

07:43.260 --> 07:46.160
Argh. The porcupine brothers.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.500
Though that'd be easier
if we had Bunga to help.

07:48.540 --> 07:50.510
Ono, go find Bunga.

07:50.540 --> 07:52.070
Affirmative.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.280
There you go, guys.
See you next time.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.380
<i>Thanks.</i>

08:02.320 --> 08:04.150
Every storm it's the same thing.

08:04.190 --> 08:06.050
You'd think they'd just move.

08:06.090 --> 08:08.090
They like it here. It's cozy.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.990
Yeah, but how cozy
do you really want to be

08:11.030 --> 08:12.230
when you're a porcupine?

08:12.260 --> 08:14.830
<i>Ow, watch those quills!</i>

08:17.030 --> 08:19.430
Okay, who wants to crawl in
and make sure

08:19.470 --> 08:22.170
Ushari and the cobras
aren't stuck in the mud?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.300
Don't look at me.

08:25.210 --> 08:29.040
It's times like this
we really need Bunga.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.410
- Yeah, but he's...
- Everyone!

08:30.440 --> 08:33.240
You gotta see what's going on
at Hakuna Matata Falls!

08:39.220 --> 08:41.159
Whoa!

08:41.190 --> 08:44.030
<i>Heyvi kabisa!
What is all this?</i>

08:44.059 --> 08:46.290
Rafiki said he's the wisest...

08:46.330 --> 08:47.460
Of all the animals

08:47.500 --> 08:50.170
in the whole Pride Lands.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.130
Oh. Amazing.

08:53.170 --> 08:56.270
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not so fast, kids.

08:56.300 --> 08:59.200
If you want to see him,
you've got to wait in line!

09:00.110 --> 09:01.180
See who?

09:01.210 --> 09:02.410

Bunga the Wise, everyone
thinks I'm stuck up

10:53.550 --> 10:56.150
because my head's
so high up in the sky.

10:56.190 --> 11:01.100
- What do I do?
- Simple. Tie a knot in your neck.

11:05.470 --> 11:07.400
Bunga the Wise, how can I keep

11:07.430 --> 11:10.160
from being scared
whenever I see a hyena?

11:11.370 --> 11:13.310
That's easy. Just...

11:14.480 --> 11:16.440
Mmm-hmm. Mmm.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.080
Thanks.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.250
Mmm, Bunga the Wise,

11:20.280 --> 11:24.290
suppose I see a pile of rocks
with a leak in it.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.220
Where do I find a stick?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.210
Just climb up a tree and grab one.

11:28.260 --> 11:30.060
Trees are full of sticks.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.430
All right, all right.
Everybody back in line.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.230
No more freebies.

11:34.260 --> 11:38.270
Don't worry. You'll all get
your turn eventually!

11:38.300 --> 11:42.400
Come on, kid, er, I mean,
Your Sage-iness.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.070
Uh, okay. Talk you all soon!

11:48.340 --> 11:50.080
Next!

11:52.210 --> 11:54.540
Ah.
You're too kind.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.220
Now, if you'll follow me...

11:56.250 --> 11:58.220
<i>- Hey! Bunga!
- Uh-oh.</i>

11:58.250 --> 12:00.120
Whoa. Whoa.

12:00.150 --> 12:05.320
What part of "wait in line"
did you kids not understand?

12:05.360 --> 12:08.130
Give me a break, Timon.
We need to talk to Bunga.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.230
It's Bunga the Wise.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.100
Oh, hi, guys.
Didn't see you there.

12:14.130 --> 12:17.110
- Come on in.
- Fine. Make it fast.

12:17.140 --> 12:20.380
We got lots of folks here
waiting their turn!

12:26.080 --> 12:27.450
Okay, I'll just be out here.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.150
Bunga, what's going on?

12:33.190 --> 12:37.130
Are you seriously giving
all of those animals advice?

12:37.160 --> 12:39.190
That's right.
You heard Rafiki.

12:39.230 --> 12:40.430
I'm super-smart.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.130
Hello?

12:43.160 --> 12:45.090
Remember?
I had that great idea

12:45.130 --> 12:46.430
to stop the lake
from flooding.

12:46.470 --> 12:48.100
I guess.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.340
So, then, I had
an even better idea.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.170
I could share my great ideas.

12:52.210 --> 12:54.110
I can help everybody
in the Pride Lands

12:54.140 --> 12:57.080
by telling them what to do.
Ow.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.150
Seriously?

12:58.180 --> 13:01.150
Bunga, you already
help the Pride Lands.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.480
You're on the Lion Guard.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.390
You're the
Pride Lands' bravest!

13:04.420 --> 13:07.020
But I'm also the smartest!

13:07.050 --> 13:10.050
It's difficult
being so gifted.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.290
Bunga...
Okay, okay. Time's up.

13:12.330 --> 13:15.060
Folks outside
ain't gettin' any smarter.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.260
Thanks for coming, guys!

13:16.300 --> 13:18.030
Next time
make an appointment!

13:18.070 --> 13:20.240
Ow.

13:20.270 --> 13:24.070
<i>If you ask me, Bunga's
the one animal in the Pride Lands</i>

13:24.100 --> 13:26.260
<i>who should not be giving advice.</i>

13:26.310 --> 13:27.480
Why's that, Fuli?

13:27.510 --> 13:30.150
He did figure out how to keep
the lake from flooding.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.380
Yeah, he did.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.250
But I just got a bad feeling
about all this.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.330
<i> Heyvi kabisa!</i>

13:49.200 --> 13:51.270
I didn't think ostriches
really did that.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.470
They don't.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
And I don't think that one
likes it very much.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.070
Come on.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.310
Oh.

14:03.340 --> 14:05.070
Thank you.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.020
Hard to breathe down there.

14:09.050 --> 14:10.450
Ugh.

14:12.090 --> 14:13.420
Sand. Ugh.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.480
Watch where you're spitting.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.460
Tall birds.

14:19.130 --> 14:20.330
Are you okay?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.460
I am now.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.400
Thanks.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.400
So why'd you stick your head

14:25.430 --> 14:27.240
in the sand
in the first place?

14:27.270 --> 14:29.340
Bunga the Wise said
it was the best way

14:29.370 --> 14:31.340
to avoid seeing hyenas.

14:31.370 --> 14:35.210
And he's the smartest
animal there is.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.480
Don't say it.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.380
<i>Hapana!</i>

14:39.410 --> 14:41.470
Those pink flowers
will make them sick.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.380
Bushbucks! Stop!

14:44.450 --> 14:47.220
I got 'em.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.450
Hey! Our flowers!

14:48.490 --> 14:50.430
You shouldn't eat these.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.430
These flowers
will make you sick.

14:52.460 --> 14:56.300
But Bunga the Wise said
pink flowers were the tastiest.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.130
And he's the smartest animal there is.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.070
I know what you're thinking.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.140
<i>Help!</i>

15:03.170 --> 15:04.370
Uh, now what?

15:05.470 --> 15:07.340
Help!

15:07.370 --> 15:09.130
Hang on!
We'll help you out.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.280
Please.
I don't like high places.

15:13.150 --> 15:16.180
Fuli, pick a horn.
Beshte, you say when.

15:18.090 --> 15:21.160
Don't worry. They
hardly ever drop anybody.

15:21.190 --> 15:24.130
Hardly ever?
Oh.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.490
Pull!

15:31.530 --> 15:33.300
Thank you so much.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.360
How'd you get trapped down there?

15:35.400 --> 15:39.110
It wasn't advice from
Bunga the Wise, was it?

15:39.140 --> 15:41.110
Why, yes, it was.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.110
I asked him about the fastest
way across the canyon.

15:44.140 --> 15:48.350
- And he just said to jump.
- Okay, go ahead and say it.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.290
I told you Bunga shouldn't be
handing out advice!

15:51.320 --> 15:54.260
Yeah.
We've got to tell him to stop.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.360
Do we have to stand in line again?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.460
I don't think so. Look!

15:58.490 --> 16:01.230
<i> # Bunga, Bunga
Ho, make way, make way #</i>

16:01.260 --> 16:03.030
<i> # He's the wisest we know #</i>

16:03.060 --> 16:06.020
<i> # Make way
for Bunga the Wise #</i>

16:06.070 --> 16:09.200
<i> # Make way for Bunga the Wise #</i>

16:09.240 --> 16:12.040
<i> # Bunga, Bunga, hey,
Bungy, Bunga, ho #</i>

16:12.070 --> 16:14.340
<i> # Make way, make way,
he's the wisest we know #</i>

16:14.370 --> 16:16.070
Catchy! I like it!

16:16.480 --> 16:20.210
- Now I've seen everything.
- Oh, come on.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.380
Oh, hi, guys.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.060
- Don't stop.
- Bunga, what are you doing?

16:30.090 --> 16:34.430
Bunga's advice is so popular
we decided to take it on the road.

16:34.460 --> 16:38.370
Bunga the Wise
"The Pride Lands Tour"!

16:38.400 --> 16:41.400
I advise you
to come along with us.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.340
- Sounds like fun.
- Sounds like trouble.

16:45.370 --> 16:48.040
Bunga, you've got to stop this.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.110
We've got enough to do trying
to deal with the rainstorm.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.270
Your bad advice
is making things worse.

16:53.310 --> 16:56.480
Me? Bad advice?

16:56.520 --> 16:59.190
- What?
- No!

16:59.220 --> 17:01.990
Rafiki said Bunga was smart.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.060
You see, Kion?
Everyone loves my advice.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.329
They wouldn't know
what to do without it.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.230
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.030
- That's right.
- We're clueless.

17:11.060 --> 17:15.030
- And Bunga gives good advice.
- You said it, Pumbaa.

17:15.069 --> 17:18.310
He's even given
the Lion Guard advice.

17:18.339 --> 17:23.109
Anybody remember a little
thing called... the dam?

17:23.140 --> 17:25.069
Yes! Whoo!

17:25.109 --> 17:27.079
- Love it!
- That's right!

17:27.109 --> 17:29.070
His idea. His advice.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.450
Problem solved. The End.

17:34.390 --> 17:39.460
And now I have some advice.
Run!

17:48.270 --> 17:50.440
We've gotta move
those animals to safety.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.170
Lion Guard, follow me!

17:57.210 --> 17:59.110
Run Bunga, run!

17:59.150 --> 18:00.350
Don't be a mook, kid!

18:00.380 --> 18:02.120
Head for the hills!

18:03.220 --> 18:05.250
I'm a member of
the Lion Guard.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.190
I can't let my friends down.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.090
Hey guys! Wait for me!

18:10.120 --> 18:11.180
Split up!

18:14.130 --> 18:16.000
You can stop fanning me now!

18:17.430 --> 18:19.170
Everyone, follow me!

18:19.200 --> 18:20.330
Now!

18:24.370 --> 18:28.040
Zebras, stay close to
each other and follow Kion.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.380
<i> Twende kiboko!</i>

18:36.380 --> 18:37.380
Got ya.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.260
Hurry! Into the canyon!

18:51.330 --> 18:52.370
Ah!

18:54.430 --> 18:55.460
Come on, kid!

18:55.500 --> 18:58.210
Run! Take my advice!

18:58.240 --> 18:59.410
Don't look back!

19:14.190 --> 19:15.420
Ono! Which way?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.000
Oh, no.

19:23.030 --> 19:25.030
Left! Go left!

19:25.070 --> 19:26.170
This way, everybody!

19:26.200 --> 19:27.200
To the left!

19:35.510 --> 19:37.380
A dead end! Oh, no!

19:37.410 --> 19:38.410
Kion!

19:42.320 --> 19:45.250
Oh, no. Look out!

19:50.060 --> 19:52.290
Kion, the walls
are too steep to climb.

19:52.330 --> 19:53.360
What do we do?

19:53.390 --> 19:57.200
Don't ask Kion.
Ask Bunga the Wise.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.430
- Bunga the Wise!
- What do we do?

19:59.470 --> 20:02.070
- Tell us.
- Uh...

20:04.140 --> 20:06.240
I don't know. Kion's
the one who always knows

20:06.270 --> 20:09.210
what to do with this
kinda stuff. Right, Kion?

20:09.240 --> 20:12.350
Right. But it's not exactly
quick and easy.

20:12.380 --> 20:15.180
Now, everyone!
Get behind me!

20:15.220 --> 20:17.250
He means it! Get behind him!

20:17.280 --> 20:18.340
Get behind him!

21:06.130 --> 21:09.270
- I like this view.
- Me, too.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.470
Yeah. This is a great place

21:11.500 --> 21:15.270
- to rest up after a rain storm.
- Until the next one.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.180
Oh. Mmm-hmm.

21:24.220 --> 21:25.390
That spot with the flowers,

21:25.420 --> 21:28.220
it looks like the perfect
place to bask in the sun.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.460
I would not lie there,
if I were you.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.060
Pfft. Come on, Rafiki.

21:33.090 --> 21:35.290
I can tell
the best spots to bask.

21:35.330 --> 21:37.330
I'm the smartest
animal around.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.360
You said so yourself.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.470
You did not hear everything I said.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.070
Honey badgers are only smartest

21:45.110 --> 21:47.540
when they think things through.

21:47.570 --> 21:49.270
Think things through?

21:52.550 --> 21:55.450
Uh. Guess I'm not
so wise after all.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.290
Oh, well.
I can live with that.
