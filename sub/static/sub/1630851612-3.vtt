<i> Last week,</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:05.270
<i> for the most unlikely audition</i>

00:05.306 --> 00:08.207
<i>in singing competition history,</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:10.075
<i> not as themselves,</i>

00:10.111 --> 00:14.613

<i>computer-generated alter ego.</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:16.215
( vocalizing )

00:16.283 --> 00:18.217
<i> eight of them</i>
<i> took one step closer</i>

00:18.285 --> 00:21.987
<i> to becoming the world's</i>
<i> first digital superstar,</i>

00:22.023 --> 00:26.258
<i> and two identities</i>
<i> were revealed to our judges</i>
<i> before being sent home.</i>

00:26.327 --> 00:27.826
This is freaking nutty-nuts.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.294

00:29.363 --> 00:31.397
♪ and I

00:31.432 --> 00:33.999
<i> five more unlikely singers</i>
<i> lay it all on the line.</i>

00:34.035 --> 00:36.301
Nevaeh: I've faced a lot
of challenges in my life,

00:36.370 --> 00:38.504
and this is what
I see in the mirror.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.006
<i> Singing is not an accepted</i>
<i> thing in my religion.</i>

00:41.042 --> 00:43.075

00:57.425 --> 01:00.592

01:00.594 --> 01:02.194
You're right up there
with the greatest.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.997
I'm just wondering
about the human behind this.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.900
This is "alter ego."

01:07.935 --> 01:10.002
rocsi:
Give it up for
your all-star judges

01:10.037 --> 01:13.472
will.I.Am.,

01:13.507 --> 01:17.576
alanis morissette,

01:17.645 --> 01:21.380
grimes,

01:21.415 --> 01:24.083
and nick lachey!

01:25.619 --> 01:27.519
You guys ready for tonight?

01:27.555 --> 01:29.388
You ready
for these auditions, grimes?

01:29.390 --> 01:30.789
Yes. Yes.

01:30.791 --> 01:34.259
I was very like, "yes, ma'am."

01:34.295 --> 01:35.994
what are you looking for
tonight in these auditions?

01:36.030 --> 01:39.565
I'm looking for
exploding head emoji.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.434
- Okay.
- I'm looking to be,
like, blown away.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.804
Also the connection
between the human being
behind the alter ego.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.073
It'd be lovely to see
what stage they're at

01:48.109 --> 01:50.008
with their relationship
with their alter egos.

01:50.044 --> 01:52.911
Music has always pushed
the edge of the envelope,

01:52.947 --> 01:54.646
and always pushed
the boundaries,

01:54.715 --> 01:56.482
and that's why
I'm so happy and proud
to be a part of this show.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.151
All right, obviously
it's a very different

01:59.186 --> 02:01.019
judging experience
that's gonna be happening here.

02:01.021 --> 02:04.490
You guys have no idea
of the human identity

02:04.558 --> 02:06.658
of the person
that's actually singing.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.195
Now it's time to meet
our first alter ego

02:10.231 --> 02:11.730
the dawn majesty.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.987
What the what the what?

02:36.190 --> 02:38.991
All right, the dawn majesty,

02:39.026 --> 02:40.859
I've got to ask you first
about your name.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.628
Why can't it just
be dawn majesty?

02:42.663 --> 02:45.564
Dawn majesty felt
a little too informal.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.167
When you have the opportunity
to name yourself

02:48.202 --> 02:50.869
and give yourself a title,
you choose a title.

02:50.905 --> 02:53.672
I mean, come on!

02:53.707 --> 02:55.140
Can I just say
how blown I am away

02:55.209 --> 02:56.875
with the freaking
facial expressions and stuff?

02:56.911 --> 02:59.144
Right, do you see this skirt?

02:59.213 --> 03:01.947
- A lot of movement.
- Would you look at that?
A full skirt.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.552
What?
You just, like,
blew my orange hat off.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.488
Alanis: Besides confidence,

03:09.557 --> 03:11.623
what qualities
are in this alter ego

03:11.625 --> 03:15.727
that you want to foster in your
day to day human incarnation?

03:15.796 --> 03:19.331
The dawn majesty
gets to bring forward

03:19.400 --> 03:23.001
parts of my true self
that I have neglected,

03:23.037 --> 03:25.938
parts that are a bit too strong,

03:26.006 --> 03:29.074
maybe not vulnerable
or heartfelt enough.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.711
My name is kaleia,
I'm 33 years old,

03:32.713 --> 03:35.514
and I am originally
from orlando, florida.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.383
My experience
in the music industry

03:38.419 --> 03:39.618
has been a lot of ups and downs.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.653
I was married for over a decade,

03:41.722 --> 03:44.056
and I put off my career
for my marriage.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.658
But it was my dream.
It was one of those dreams
I kind of gave up on.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.161
And I've been through
so many things,

03:49.196 --> 03:52.030
but that's still just
a very real truth in my life.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.266
But I'm going through a divorce,

03:54.301 --> 03:56.001
and I'll admit, I'm excited.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.470
With the dawn
comes new beginnings,

03:58.505 --> 04:01.773
so my alter ego's name
is the dawn majesty.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.743
( vocalizing )

04:04.745 --> 04:07.546
- just think about
your character.
-

04:07.581 --> 04:10.449
The technology of the alter ego
is whatever I do,

04:10.517 --> 04:12.784
whatever my movements are,
the alter ego does as well.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.653
You don't realize
how awkward you are

04:14.688 --> 04:18.423
until you're observing
yourself as a skeleton.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.025
So there's sensors
on all of my joints,

04:20.027 --> 04:23.195
and it goes through this process
of capturing that motion,

04:23.230 --> 04:27.132
and the alter ego is completely
controlled by my movement.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.467
What?

04:28.469 --> 04:30.535
Absolutely incredible.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.670
She is a superhero.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.574
I want her to have a superpower.
Yes!

04:35.643 --> 04:38.910
The dawn majesty
gives me a vehicle to know

04:38.912 --> 04:41.980
that you can live your dreams,
you can fight for them,

04:42.016 --> 04:45.517
and it's worth fighting for.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.586
Are you ready to become
a digital superstar?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.988
Oh, I am so ready.
Are you guys ready?

04:50.024 --> 04:52.524
- Is everybody ready?
- We're ready.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.026
Yes!

04:55.429 --> 04:56.828
I think it's cool
when people come on here

04:56.864 --> 04:59.564
with a message
they want to get across.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.300
Yeah, I like that she's inverse
of some of the other ones, too.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.869
She, like, presents confident
in the real world...

05:03.904 --> 05:05.871
- But knows deep down--
- which I think it's, like,
a common thing.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.653
And let's take a second
to give it up for the musicians

07:01.688 --> 07:05.190
who are backing up each one
of these performers tonight:

07:05.225 --> 07:08.693
Adam blackstone
and the alter ego band.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.364
Now, the dawn majesty,

07:12.433 --> 07:14.933
nick, I know you were
questioning the "the."

07:14.968 --> 07:16.968
I'm just calling her
your majesty from now on.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.137
- Right, for real.
- Your majesty.

07:19.173 --> 07:22.607
I am humbled and honored
to perform for legends.

07:22.676 --> 07:26.411
- I feel incredible.
- How confident
was her audition, nick?

07:26.513 --> 07:27.913
As confident
as it possibly could be.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.515
I mean, she came out of the gate
with so much energy

07:30.584 --> 07:32.551
and so much confidence
and strength.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.821
It was amazing.
Amazing.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.556
I was blown away.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.624
Yeah, I actually forgot
that there was someone
backstage singing.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.526
I was just, like,
enthralled by the performance.

07:41.595 --> 07:45.197
- I love the laser eyes.
- The freaking laser eyes!

07:46.233 --> 07:50.268
Yo, what the what,
the what, the what?

07:52.673 --> 07:55.140
- Alanis?
- When you came out to perform,

07:55.175 --> 07:56.508
I mean, it was one
after the other.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.311
Just like feminist icon
coming out just going,

07:59.346 --> 08:01.947
"what is in fact wrong
with being confident?"

08:01.982 --> 08:04.182
- you know?
- Will.I.Am: I'm sorry.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.818
It's like--
I'm still blown away.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.456
The dawn majesty,
as our first performer,

08:11.525 --> 08:15.727
you can go ahead
and take your place
on the diamond.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.697
Yeah.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.135
Remember, the alter ego
who is standing on the diamond

08:24.171 --> 08:27.205
at the end of the show
automatically advances

08:27.274 --> 08:28.974
to the head-to-head round, okay?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.543
There are four more alter egos
still to audition.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.179
We'll be right back.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.948
The age, where she's from...

08:36.984 --> 08:38.783
Yeah, no.
I can't call this.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.485
I have absolutely no idea.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.191
♪ and I wish you joy

08:46.226 --> 08:49.060
that was my favorite performance
of the whole competition.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.997
Israa:
<i> I need the alter ego</i>
<i> because I don't fit</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:53.865
<i> the conventional idea</i>
<i> of a pop star.</i>

08:53.901 --> 08:56.468
- What the what?
- Was that tears?

08:56.470 --> 08:58.470
- Wow!
- Yeah, man, for real.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.438
I'm blown away
by this technology.

09:00.474 --> 09:04.142
Rocsi: <i> Which alter egos</i>
<i>are advancing to the next round,</i>

09:04.177 --> 09:06.978
<i> and who will reveal their</i>
<i>true identity to the judges?</i>

09:06.980 --> 09:09.014
- Yeah!
- Hi, nick.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.016
- Whoa.
- You put me
in the friend zone.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.617
Oh!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.858
<i> Here we go.</i>
<i> Places, everybody.</i>

09:19.860 --> 09:22.627
- Check, one, two.
<i> - In three, two, one.</i>

09:26.266 --> 09:29.501
This is "alter ego,"
the singing competition

09:29.503 --> 09:32.704
where one lucky contestant
gets the chance to become the
superstar

09:32.739 --> 09:35.373
they were always meant to be.

09:35.409 --> 09:40.912
It's time to meet
our next alter ego,
kingston sol.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.516
I love being a pastor.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.418
I love being able
to serve people.

09:46.453 --> 09:50.255
But doing "alter ego,"
I can get a little bit wild.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.658
My name is james peck,
I'm 35 years old,

09:53.694 --> 09:56.328
and I do music ministry
particularly.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.096
Church singing is not about

09:58.131 --> 10:00.999
can I have
the craziest performance?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.668
But the chance
of having an alter ego
gives me some freedom

10:03.670 --> 10:06.037
just to, like, sing the hell
out of some songs.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.475
We put on a bodysuit
which is really tight

10:10.510 --> 10:12.444
and leaves nothing
to the imagination.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.113
And it captures
our facial expressions,

10:15.148 --> 10:17.983
how we sing, how we emote,
our body motions.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.352
And by putting on our helmet
and our suit,

10:20.387 --> 10:22.420
we become our alter egos.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.790
Kingston sol gives me
a chance to be free.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.292
Oh, my god.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.027
A chance to be the artist

10:29.029 --> 10:30.695
that I've always
dreamed of being.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.430
It feels like he has
this physical presence.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.966
I just want him
to have a lot of heart.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.501
Yeah, that's exactly right.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.003
That is exactly what I want.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.605
He's got a big grin
and big hair.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.874
I just wanted him
to be bigger than life.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.409
♪ yeah

10:44.444 --> 10:45.877
I think it would be so fun

10:45.912 --> 10:48.713
to kind of just play
and have fun onstage.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.558
Yeah!

11:00.594 --> 11:02.060
Hey, kingston sol.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.929
- Hey, he looks cool.
- Robin: I see you.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.200
I'm getting, like,
a nick nolte vibe here
or something.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.936
Or, like, who's the guy--
is it meatloaf?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.540
- Hey!
- Aloha.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.276
- How you feeling today?
- I'm feeling the vibes.
I'm feeling good.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.915
Why is his booty
shaking like that?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.320
I got that booty,
I'm telling ya.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.256
So, kingston sol.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.225
So s-o-l, does it mean "sun"?
What does it mean to you?

11:34.261 --> 11:36.361
Well, you nailed it
right on the head for me.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.830
- "sol" as latin for "sun."
- right.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.232
And I'm all
about love and light.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.169
Mmm.
I love that.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.704
The gentle giant.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.540
- What do you do for a living?
- "I booty shake."

11:49.676 --> 11:50.809
I'm actually a pastor,

11:50.844 --> 11:52.844
and I've been a spiritual leader

11:52.879 --> 11:55.513
for a long time of my life.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.682
It's okay, will.
We can party in church.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.318
I swear to god,
I did not mean to say

12:00.353 --> 12:02.153
that the pastor was
booty shaking for a living.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.855
- I did not mean none of that.
- Kingston: It's okay.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.458
It's all good.
It's all good.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.693
Okay, are you ready
to sing for us, kingston sol?

12:08.729 --> 12:09.828
Yeah, I'm ready to sing.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.996
- Take it away.
- Thanks.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.867
I wonder if, like--
"what do you want
your avatar to do?"

12:15.869 --> 12:17.001
and he was like,
"yo, make my booty jiggle."

12:17.037 --> 12:18.503
"I need my booty jiggling."

12:26.313 --> 12:28.480

14:12.719 --> 14:15.019
Oh, my goodness,
I think all the girls

14:15.021 --> 14:17.021
were, like, swooning in here.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.357
- Oh, man!
- It's not just
the girls swooning.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.860
- I'm swooning now.
- Kingston: Oh, nick!

14:21.895 --> 14:25.396
You was, like, crouched down
and freaking hearts
was coming out your chest.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.465
I'm like,
"yo, what the what the what?"

14:28.869 --> 14:33.204
well, kingston sol,
you did absolutely amazing.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.274
But was it enough

14:36.309 --> 14:41.713
to knock the dawn majesty
off the diamond?

14:41.748 --> 14:45.283
Judges,
it is that time to decide.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.352
Kingston, when you came out,
I had no idea

14:47.354 --> 14:49.354
what genre of music
or how your voice would be,

14:49.389 --> 14:51.923
- and it was
a pleasant surprise.
- Awesome. Thank you.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.125
And I could tell that you
were one with the song.

14:54.160 --> 14:58.196
I totally resonate
with that idea of being lost

14:58.231 --> 15:02.100
and then being found by love,
so, yeah.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.370
- Grimes: Yeah.
- I could really feel
your connection to the lyrics,

15:05.438 --> 15:07.138
and that was palpable.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.140
Grimes: Oh, my god!
He has real tears.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.910
- Alanis: Oh!
- What the what the what?

15:11.945 --> 15:13.144
- Is that tears?
- Grimes: Yeah.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.346
Will.I.Am:
Wow, are you for real for real?

15:15.382 --> 15:19.717
- Yeah, man, for real.
- I'm really blown away
by this technology.

15:19.753 --> 15:24.989
The dawn majesty,
I loved your performance,

15:25.025 --> 15:27.659
but I believe kingston sol
resonated with me

15:27.694 --> 15:31.863
in a way that
is going to kindly,
in a canadian-american way,

15:31.865 --> 15:33.998
ask you to jump off that diamond
to make space for him.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.535
Rocsi: All right.
Grimes?

15:37.604 --> 15:40.405
Kingston, I thought you
actually had the best sfx.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.841
Those hearts were awesome.

15:43.877 --> 15:48.746
But, dawn, I think you
might be the best pop star
I've seen so far.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.148
- ( gasps )
- wow!

15:50.183 --> 15:52.083
So I'll keep dawn
on the diamond.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.785
Rocsi: All right.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.820
So it's one and one right now.
Nick?

15:55.855 --> 16:00.925
Kingston sol, I am so intrigued
by your alter ego.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.694
Your message,
it's just so impactful,

16:02.696 --> 16:06.064
and that's the thing
making me put kingston sol
on the diamond.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.767
Rocsi: Wow.
Okay.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.970
We have two votes
for kingston sol

16:12.038 --> 16:15.340
and one vote
for the dawn majesty.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.342
Will, it is all on you.

16:17.377 --> 16:22.046
So, the dawn majesty's
performance was majestic,

16:22.115 --> 16:26.584
and her power was,
like, earth-shattering.

16:26.586 --> 16:31.823
And I didn't think
that there was any competition
until kingston sol came up.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.826
You got a cool personality,
and when you were singing,

16:34.861 --> 16:36.861
that s-o-l became s-o-u-l.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.698
My mom would be like,
"now that boy could sang."

16:42.202 --> 16:43.401
this is a tough one.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.804
Are you on the sol train or not?

16:46.840 --> 16:49.707
Uh...

16:49.743 --> 16:51.943
Aloha, bro.
I'm going with sol.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.345
- Yeah!
- Awesome.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.482
- Congratulations,
kingston sol.
- Robin: Kingston sol!

16:57.517 --> 17:02.286
You knocked the dawn majesty
off her spot of the diamond,

17:02.322 --> 17:05.189
which means the dawn majesty

17:05.225 --> 17:09.060
is now in jeopardy
of going home later.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.030
But it's okay.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.665
Coming up, three more
very special singers

17:14.701 --> 17:16.834
are going to wow the judges.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.837
This is "alter ego" on fox.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.806
Kingston sol rocked it,

17:21.875 --> 17:25.676
and it is unbelievable
to be the artist
I've always wanted to be.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.355
Welcome back.
This is "alter ego."

17:37.390 --> 17:39.657
kingston sol,
currently on the diamond,

17:39.692 --> 17:41.259
safe from elimination.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.994
For the moment.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.496
And, judges, while you keep
on guessing who they are,

17:45.532 --> 17:48.132
me and my friends at home
will keep on meeting the people

17:48.201 --> 17:50.001
behind their alter egos,

17:50.036 --> 17:52.503
like the one who created
night journey.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.142
It's really easy to look at me

17:58.178 --> 18:01.479
and make assumptions as to,
like, who I am as a person.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.682
But I'm 100% out
to break the stereotypes.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.852
I need an alter ego
because I don't fit

18:07.854 --> 18:10.721
the conventional idea
of a pop star.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.257
I'm israa,
I'm lebanese-american,

18:13.259 --> 18:15.326
and I'm a singer-songwriter.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.161
I've always liked to sing,

18:17.230 --> 18:19.630
even though it's not necessarily
an accepted thing

18:19.666 --> 18:21.966
in my religion or my culture.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.701
And because of that,
people look at me,

18:23.703 --> 18:27.105
and they assume that
I'm doing something bad.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.375
At first, I got a lot of hate,

18:31.411 --> 18:34.345
a lot of people telling me
that I was going to hell
for making music.

18:34.347 --> 18:38.182
I got people telling me
to take off my hijab
if I want to make it in music,

18:38.184 --> 18:40.184
which is, like, super offensive.

18:40.186 --> 18:44.355
My interpretation
is that music is empathy

18:44.390 --> 18:46.357
and empathy is love,

18:46.392 --> 18:48.659
and my religion,
islam, means "peace."

18:48.695 --> 18:50.495
so it's peace
and love and music,

18:50.530 --> 18:52.663
and that's all connected to me.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.467
My alter ego's name
is night journey.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.669
Night journey
actually is my name.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.605
Israa means
"night journey" in arabic.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.975
When I perform, I really,
really want her to glow.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.576
That is so dope.

19:05.578 --> 19:09.013
Night journey brings me courage,

19:09.015 --> 19:11.349
and she empowers me.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.817
I would love to win "alter ego."

19:12.852 --> 19:17.321
I want to prove that
a muslim girl can be a pop star.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.457
You know, things are changing,
and it's really cool.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.326
I'm a part of that change,
that's why it's so cool.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.546
- Hey!
- Nick: Okay.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.516
Night journey,
I think you have
the most beautiful name

19:45.552 --> 19:48.186
and the most beautiful alter ego
we've seen here tonight.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.620
- So, yeah.
- Thank you.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.059
You serving looks today.
We serving looks out here.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.062
Where are you from,
night journey?

19:58.064 --> 20:00.731
- I am from the dark.
- Wow!

20:00.800 --> 20:03.701
- That's where I'm from.
- "where you from?"
"I'm from the dark."

20:04.904 --> 20:07.205
"we serving looks."

20:07.240 --> 20:09.106
I'm from the dark, too.
Dark skin.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.945
- Yeah, you are.
- Hey!

20:13.980 --> 20:15.680
- Come on! Nick!
- Whoo!

20:15.715 --> 20:18.516
So, night journey,
a lot of people tend
to dream in the night.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.518
So I'm curious,
what's your dream?

20:20.553 --> 20:23.621
My dream is to be
right here where I'm standing.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.357
This is amazing,
this is such a cool opportunity,

20:26.392 --> 20:28.159
and I'm so happy to be here.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.828
This is actually
my first audition.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.830
- Wow. Wow.
- My first big audition.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.566
- Whoa.
- I've always been different.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.768
I've always been
more of an outsider.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.838
And this was an opportunity
for me to be a musician,

20:40.873 --> 20:42.673
for me to be a singer,

20:42.675 --> 20:44.141
and to put everything
else aside.

20:44.210 --> 20:47.311
And that's why I'm here.
I'm here to shine my light.

20:48.715 --> 20:52.049
Well, I would love to hear
what you have
to perform for us tonight.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.421

like an outsider,

22:54.040 --> 22:57.007
but, girl, you sitting at
the cool kids table right now.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.477
- How you feeling?
- I feel like it.
I feel amazing.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.380
It is time for the judges
to decide

23:02.415 --> 23:04.982
whether your audition was enough

23:05.017 --> 23:09.186
to take the diamond
from kingston sol.

23:11.224 --> 23:12.456
Grimes?

23:12.492 --> 23:13.657
Yeah, that was
my favorite performance

23:13.693 --> 23:15.659
of the whole competition.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.894
Robin: Wow.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.662
Oh, my god.
Thank you so much.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.498
Yeah, I actually had chills,
which is hard.

23:20.533 --> 23:24.502
- I feel like that's--
- girl, don't make me cry
right now.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.670
I am such a huge fan
of you, grimes.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.906
And any time you want
to borrow this fit,

23:28.908 --> 23:31.509
you know,
my wardrobe is your wardrobe.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.310
- So this, all this--
- you guys are
swapping clothes already?

23:33.346 --> 23:36.280
Yeah, I have to say,
I think you should be
on the diamond.

23:36.315 --> 23:39.683
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
- All right.

23:39.719 --> 23:43.187
What you just did
is wow an audience

23:43.189 --> 23:47.158
with your simplicity
and your storytelling.

23:47.193 --> 23:50.194
A lot of times, in my opinion,
that's harder to do

23:50.229 --> 23:52.296
than to do some crazy riff,
and it's more impressive.

23:52.365 --> 23:55.099
But there was something about
kingston sol's performance

23:55.168 --> 23:57.301
that just puts it
slightly over the top for me,

23:57.370 --> 23:59.470
so I want to keep kingston sol
on top of that diamond.

23:59.505 --> 24:02.106
Rocsi: Okay.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.942
All right, one and one
right now.
Will?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.144
Night journey's audition
was awesome.

24:07.180 --> 24:10.181
I loved your answer
on where you're from.

24:10.183 --> 24:12.149
I'm still flipping on that.

24:12.185 --> 24:14.185
It's pretty gangsta, right?

24:14.187 --> 24:16.620
No, that's--
that's beyond gangster there.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.189
That's beyond, yeah.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.025
But my mama
is gonna get mad at me

24:21.027 --> 24:24.061
if I don't keep kingston sol
up there on that diamond.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.664
Rocsi: Wow.
Well, okay.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.667
So far we have two votes
for kingston sol

24:29.669 --> 24:32.303
and one vote for night journey.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.305
It just--it's a lot of pressure
right now, alanis.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.475
- I feel sorry for you.
- Thank you for your empathy.

24:37.510 --> 24:40.678
There are so many details
in your alter ego aesthetic

24:40.713 --> 24:43.347
and then also the performance
and the song choice.

24:43.349 --> 24:46.150
It was just a nice blend of
everything that I love the most,

24:46.185 --> 24:50.721
- so I'm gonna
make this a tie...
- What?

24:50.756 --> 24:52.256
Alanis:
...And choose night journey.

24:52.325 --> 24:56.427
Rocsi: Okay, since the judges
have voted for a tie,

24:56.429 --> 24:58.062
guess what, audience?

24:58.097 --> 25:00.664
It is up to you guys to decide

25:00.700 --> 25:03.367
who gets to go up
on that diamond.

25:03.436 --> 25:05.970
Please vote now.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.775
Kingston sol or night journey?

25:17.450 --> 25:19.817
The votes have been counted,

25:19.852 --> 25:23.487
and I can now confirm
that the audience voted for...

25:26.559 --> 25:28.225
Kingston sol.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.998
You get to stay
up on the diamond.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.301
Sadly, that means
that night journey

25:37.336 --> 25:41.672
is now at risk
of being eliminated
at the end of the show.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.841
- No!
- After the break,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.676
a performer who is ready
to push boundaries

25:45.711 --> 25:47.278
and change
how the world sees her.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.747
More "alter ego" on fox
after this.

25:49.749 --> 25:50.748
Nick: Yeah!

25:52.184 --> 25:54.852
I feel like she's young
with an old soul, though.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.453
Yeah, super old soul.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.696
I keep tripping on the fact
that there's somebody backstage

26:05.731 --> 26:09.900
singing all this stuff
that we never get to see,
you know?

26:11.871 --> 26:13.537
Welcome back to "alter ego."

26:13.573 --> 26:16.707
now please give it up
for nevaeh king.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.447
- Whoa, cool.
- Okay!

26:29.956 --> 26:31.155
Nick: Okay.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.125
Yes!
Hey.

26:36.596 --> 26:39.430
- Nevaeh king.
- Yes, yes.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.632
Wow, thanks
for coming here tonight.

26:41.667 --> 26:45.469
- I think will likes you.
- Hi, will.

26:45.471 --> 26:49.239
- Hi, nick!
- Oh! Whoa. Oh!

26:49.275 --> 26:51.108
I've had a crush on him
for a very long time.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.377
Well, tell me a little bit more
about yourself then.

26:53.446 --> 26:56.080
- Let's speed date.
- Speed date.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.682
Why do you feel like
you need an alter ego?

26:58.718 --> 27:00.517
Well, I faced a lot
of challenges in my life,

27:00.553 --> 27:03.520
and this is what I see
in the mirror.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.022
Love it.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.893
My whole life,
I've had people try to put me
in some pretty box,

27:09.929 --> 27:11.895
but I've always been an oddity.

27:11.931 --> 27:15.065
And as nevaeh, I get to match

27:15.101 --> 27:17.434
the look and the sound as one.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.238
My name is jay miah,

27:21.273 --> 27:24.742
and I am the voice
behind nevaeh king.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.543
Based on looks, I'm a man,

27:26.545 --> 27:27.745
but I've had a lot of people

27:27.747 --> 27:29.346
assume I was a woman
when I sing.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.782
So with nevaeh,
I'm able to get people

27:31.784 --> 27:34.218
to fall in love
with my natural voice

27:34.253 --> 27:35.819
and not come with any pretenses.

27:37.456 --> 27:41.191
So becoming nevaeh king
has been a really fun process.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.093
Wow!
Yes.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.862
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.899
Nevaeh is totally
a glamour goddess.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.235
I myself, as jay,

27:51.270 --> 27:53.537
wouldn't necessarily
flirt with nick.

27:53.606 --> 27:58.242
But onstage as nevaeh,
it's all in fun.

27:58.277 --> 28:02.046
I know nevaeh king can be
the next major superstar.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.782
I don't want to be
eliminated round one.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.684
I know I'm going to shine.

Spectacular.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.669
It just got harder.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.540
First of all,
let me just say this.

30:09.575 --> 30:12.309
I felt like you were singing
that entire song to me.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.644
Oh, yes.

30:15.548 --> 30:18.682
It's so awesome
to be able to exude

30:18.717 --> 30:20.551
this character and become her.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.219
Rocsi: I love it.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.621
Well, it's one thing
to impress the judges

30:24.657 --> 30:26.056
with your audition.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.425
But it's another
to impress them enough

30:28.460 --> 30:30.761
to make it on the diamond.

30:32.431 --> 30:36.033
This is so hard.
Does kingston sol
get to stay on the diamond

30:36.068 --> 30:40.103
or does nevaeh king
get to take his place?

30:40.172 --> 30:42.239
Kingston sol is my man,

30:42.274 --> 30:44.208
and he and I are gonna
have drinks later at the bar,

30:44.243 --> 30:46.944
but nevaeh king belongs
on that diamond.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.445
All right.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.915
Yeah, that was sick.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.851
Both of you guys
represent futurism

30:53.886 --> 30:56.753
in a unique way that
I haven't really seen before.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.155
Nevaeh, I think you're
one of the best looking

30:58.190 --> 31:00.123
alter egos of this whole thing,

31:00.159 --> 31:04.194
and I am gonna vote for nevaeh
to go on the diamond.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.898
Rocsi:
That's two votes right there.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.601
Alanis, dying to know
what you think.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.903
I love your voice,
nevaeh, so much.

31:14.707 --> 31:18.575
But kingston sol,
I just resonate with
your frequency in a big way,

31:18.644 --> 31:21.445
so I'm gonna keep kingston sol
up on that diamond.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.950
- Nick: Okay.
- We're 2-1 right now.

31:26.986 --> 31:31.321
- Will?
- Before she sung,
nevaeh knocked my socks off.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.190
Then she revealed
her crush with nick

31:33.192 --> 31:35.292
and put me in the friend zone.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.998
But you brought it,
like, for real,

31:41.033 --> 31:44.234
and that level of talent
not on the radio

31:44.236 --> 31:46.036
or not having albums out,

31:46.071 --> 31:47.905
that breaks my heart.

31:47.973 --> 31:50.874
So, nevaeh on the diamond.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.542
All right!

31:54.513 --> 31:59.483
Nevaeh king, congratulations.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.585
Yeah!

32:03.155 --> 32:06.890
Which means kingston sol
is now in danger

32:06.959 --> 32:10.027
of being eliminated
at the end of the show.

32:10.062 --> 32:13.330
A lot is gonna happen.
Stick around,
because we'll be right back.

32:17.336 --> 32:20.504
- I picture maybe 50-ish?
- Yeah?

32:20.539 --> 32:21.538
That's where the show
gets me, though,

32:21.607 --> 32:23.040
'cause I could be
completely off.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.875
Like, she could be anything.

32:34.153 --> 32:37.120
This is "alter ego,"
and I am rocsi diaz.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.957
Have you guys been impressed
with the auditions tonight?

32:39.992 --> 32:41.391
I don't want
to send anyone home.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.060
Well, we're gonna have to.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.629
- Do we really have to?
- Yep, we really have to.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.031
52 people on that diamond.
Let's do this.

32:50.069 --> 32:53.704
Well, there's only one
alter ego left,

32:53.772 --> 32:57.641
and no everyone at home
gets a chance to learn
about st. Luna.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.711
I'm a little nervous.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.014
I don't like being on camera.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.583
The being onstage part
of performing

33:06.585 --> 33:09.286
is probably
my least favorite part of it.

33:09.355 --> 33:12.422
My name is sarah eisen, I am 21,

33:12.424 --> 33:15.225
and I am from
berkeley, california.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.060
When I was 12
and I started modeling,

33:17.096 --> 33:18.829
I looked really old for my age,

33:18.864 --> 33:21.865
and I was being perceived
as an adult woman really young.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.700
And it created
a very nuanced relationship

33:23.736 --> 33:25.736
with my body
from a really young age.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.339
I think this show
allows me to take away

33:29.375 --> 33:32.075
that aspect of being a musician,

33:32.111 --> 33:34.244
and the way I look
shouldn't be necessary

33:34.279 --> 33:35.912
for me to have
a career in music.

33:35.948 --> 33:38.315
<i> ♪ rise up like I'm marching</i>
<i> through the fire ♪</i>

33:38.350 --> 33:40.817
the name of my alter ego
is st. Luna.

33:40.886 --> 33:43.653
I've been working
with the team to try
and really customize it.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.422
Oh, wow.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.525
Is there any way that
we could change the pants?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.694
Oh, yeah, that's better.
I like that.

33:50.763 --> 33:53.230
St. Luna,
I really wanted her to be

33:53.265 --> 33:56.099
this super strong,
confident woman.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.635
I think that st. Luna sets me up
in a really good way.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.071
I think that we could do
really well together.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.305

34:05.077 --> 34:06.076

34:10.249 --> 34:12.049
What's up, st. Luna?
Let's start with the name.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.383
St. Luna is very cool.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.352
Do you feel bonded
to your alter ego?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.988
Yeah, I think
we're still figuring
each other out a little bit.

34:18.023 --> 34:20.957
We're exploring
our relationship.

34:20.993 --> 34:23.660
- Right.
- Yeah, it's definitely new.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.695
What is cool
about "alter ego" to me

34:25.731 --> 34:28.198
is I can separate my music
from my image,

34:28.233 --> 34:31.068
and I get to have
bodily autonomy.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.636
- Alanis: Nice.
- That's what I'm really
looking for here.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.907
Well, let's hear it.
We're ready to hear it.

34:38.343 --> 34:40.110
I hope she's good,
'cause she looks great.

Oh, stop.

36:30.622 --> 36:34.057
It's time to figure out
if it was enough to earn you

36:34.092 --> 36:36.593
that spot on
the diamond tonight.

36:37.930 --> 36:41.398
This is a huge decision.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.668
Grimes, what did
you think of st. Luna?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.870
Should she be on the diamond?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.638
I voted nevaeh up there,
so I think she's great.

36:48.674 --> 36:51.708
But I just think st. Luna
seemed more futuristic,

36:51.743 --> 36:54.077
and I think you're using
the technology really well.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.946
Like, I just think you look sick

36:55.981 --> 36:59.015
and probably the best
of the night.

36:59.084 --> 37:02.085
So I'm gonna vote
for st. Luna...

37:02.154 --> 37:04.454
- Okay.
- Into the diamond.

37:04.489 --> 37:08.391
That is one for st. Luna.
Nick?

37:08.427 --> 37:10.694
There was something
that really drew me in.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.862
You were so soulful.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.165
And I love the approach
of the song, too,

37:15.234 --> 37:18.235
and that's why I would like
to put st. Luna on the diamond.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.936
Wow.

37:23.108 --> 37:24.074
Will?

37:24.109 --> 37:25.742
St. Luna, you were awesome.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.111
Your voice is spectacular.

37:28.146 --> 37:31.414
To nevaeh, although you
put me in the friend zone...

37:31.450 --> 37:33.383
Oh!

37:33.418 --> 37:35.885
You brought it, like, for real.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.221
So I'ma keep you
on the diamond, girl.

37:38.223 --> 37:39.222
Oh!

37:42.094 --> 37:46.429
Well, right now we're
at two votes for st. Luna,

37:46.465 --> 37:49.499
one for nevaeh.
Alanis, no pressure.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.669
"back to black" is one of
my favorite songs in the world,

37:52.671 --> 37:57.340
so you definitely had
a little extra edge for me.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.743
- And you performed it
beautifully.
- Thank you.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.845
St. Luna, you're going
straight to the next round.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.446
What?

38:06.051 --> 38:08.218
Thank you so--
oh, thank you!

38:08.253 --> 38:11.254
Rocsi:
Congratulations to st. Luna.

38:11.256 --> 38:15.058
You can take your place
on that diamond right now.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.459
Okay!

38:17.763 --> 38:20.430
And since you are the last
contestant of the night

38:20.465 --> 38:22.098
to be on the diamond,

38:22.100 --> 38:25.535
you automatically advance
to the next round.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.505
We're gonna see you
in the head-to-head.

38:28.540 --> 38:33.677
Right now, our in-studio
audience will vote
for their favorite alter ego.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.812
The two that get the most votes

38:35.847 --> 38:39.182
advance to the next round
along with st. Luna.

38:39.184 --> 38:41.117
Then it will be up to our judges

38:41.153 --> 38:44.788
to decide which of
the remaining two alter egos
stay in the competition,

38:44.856 --> 38:47.891
and which one will reveal
their true identity

38:47.959 --> 38:49.993
to the judges and go home.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.394
Don't go anywhere.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.463
It's gonna suck when
we have to kick someone off.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.265
Easily my least favorite part
of this whole thing.

38:58.070 --> 39:01.571
<i> Everybody, places.</i>

39:01.606 --> 39:03.773
<i>Going to rocsi in three, two...</i>

39:06.778 --> 39:09.179
Welcome back to "alter ego."

39:09.214 --> 39:11.214
four contestants remain,

39:11.249 --> 39:14.651
and only three of them
will move on.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.886
We've tallied
the audience's votes,

39:16.922 --> 39:19.589
and the top two alter egos

39:19.624 --> 39:22.092
advancing to the next round,

39:22.127 --> 39:24.361
in no particular order, are...

39:30.702 --> 39:31.701
Nevaeh king!

39:41.780 --> 39:42.779
And...

39:45.517 --> 39:46.950
Kingston sol!

39:49.988 --> 39:52.222
Congratulations.

39:52.257 --> 39:54.090
You will be moving on

39:54.159 --> 39:57.394
to the head-to-heads
with st. Luna.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.464
And now it's in your hands,
judges.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.233
My heart's beating.

40:03.268 --> 40:06.035
Rocsi: You have to decide
which one of these alter egos

40:06.071 --> 40:07.937
gets to stay in the competition

40:08.006 --> 40:10.173
and which one will reveal
their true identity

40:10.242 --> 40:12.442
and go home tonight.

40:12.477 --> 40:15.111
So, first off,
dawn majesty was awesome.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.347
I feel like night journey
has a lot of pain.

40:17.349 --> 40:19.315
I feel like
there's some depth in her.

40:19.351 --> 40:22.352
There's a lot of soulful,
spiritual symbolism.

40:22.387 --> 40:25.922
- Was she the best one?
- I don't know. Um...

40:25.957 --> 40:27.557
This is so tough.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.094
- Are we all...
- Yeah.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.429
Let's do it.

40:35.667 --> 40:39.903
Rocsi:
Between the dawn majesty
and night journey,

40:39.971 --> 40:42.038
who is going home?

40:42.073 --> 40:44.841
Judges, what is your decision?

40:44.876 --> 40:48.711
The truth is,
we would love to see
where both your journeys go,

40:48.747 --> 40:50.947
but at the end of the day...

40:56.154 --> 40:59.155
...The night journey
is who we'd like to have
head to the next round.

40:59.191 --> 41:02.058
Rocsi: All right!

41:02.093 --> 41:05.061
Congratulations
to the night journey.

41:05.096 --> 41:08.531
You move on to the head-to-head.

41:11.303 --> 41:14.237
The dawn majesty,
we would really love for you

41:14.272 --> 41:16.105
to sing one last time for us

41:16.141 --> 41:19.142
and reveal your true identity
to the judges.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.146
- Yeah!
- It would be a pleasure.

41:24.316 --> 41:27.484
I don't want
to regret my choice.
I know I'm about to.

Judges, I would like
to introduce you

42:52.604 --> 42:57.707
to kaleia, aka the dawn majesty.

43:01.680 --> 43:05.214
There's a unique place in hell
for judges like us.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.551
Hey, not me!
I voted for you, girl.

43:09.821 --> 43:12.422
Appreciate you, will.I.Am.

43:14.192 --> 43:17.527
- Will.I.Am: Your range is,
like, powerful.
- Thank you.

43:17.596 --> 43:20.063
Of course, we were wondering
about the human behind this.

43:20.065 --> 43:22.398
So, of course, I was picturing
all kinds of versions

43:22.467 --> 43:24.434
of what you may be,
and they're all wrong.

43:24.469 --> 43:25.602
I'm blown away.

43:25.637 --> 43:28.338
We were, like,
having massive regrets.

43:28.406 --> 43:29.906
You're, like,
an unbelievable singer. Sorry.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.909
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.744
What would you like to say
to your alter ego?

43:34.779 --> 43:37.280
Thank you
for being strong for me,

43:37.315 --> 43:41.184
and thank you for letting me
step forward as myself.

43:41.219 --> 43:45.054
And I am not scared to be seen.

43:45.123 --> 43:48.358
Kaleia, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

43:48.393 --> 43:50.660
I cannot wait to see
what happens next week.

43:50.695 --> 43:52.996
We'll see you then.
Good night.

43:56.434 --> 43:57.700
That was sick.
