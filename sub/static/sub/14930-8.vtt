WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
ED, HOW COME I KEEP GETTING
DELINQUENCY NOTICES
FROM CLAUDIA'S DOCTOR?

00:08.509 --> 00:12.813
I THOUGHT, UH,
OUR INSURANCE DOWN AT THE BAR
COVERED HER PREGNANCY.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.315
OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.383
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THAT'D BE GREAT?

00:15.416 --> 00:18.719
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THAT WE HAD A $200,000 POLICY.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.189
NO. THAT'S
THE DEDUCTIBLE.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.756
WE NEED BETTER INSURANCE.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.791
WELL, WE CAN'T
AFFORD IT.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.526
THE BAR'S
NOT EXACTLY HOPPING.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.128
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS LADIES' NIGHT.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.063
THEY'LL BE HERE.
KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

00:29.097 --> 00:32.133
HEY. EDDIE, I GOT YOUR CALL.
WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.701
IT'S LADIES' NIGHT.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.103
YEAH.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.737
NO.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.707
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THINGS
WILL PICK UP SOON, HUH?

00:39.740 --> 00:40.708
I DOUBT IT.
LOOK AT THIS.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.744
T.J. SHENANIGANS
IS OPENING UP A NEW BAR.
WHAT?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.079
YEAH. THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR A NEW
REGIONAL MANAGER.

00:45.113 --> 00:49.517
CAN YOU IMAGINE WORKING
FOR THAT SOUL-SUCKING
CORPORATE HELLHOLE?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.220
NO WAY.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.123
50K STARTING.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.390
THAT'S A LOT OF "K."

00:56.424 --> 00:58.092
FULL BENEFITS,
MEDICAL, DENTAL--

00:58.126 --> 00:59.560
WHO CARES?
WE GOT OUR OWN BENEFITS.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.429
WE'RE--WE'RE
OUR OWN BOSSES,
YOU KNOW?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.764
WE WORK FOR FAMILY.
WE'RE LIVING THE DREAM.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.932
YEAH, EXACTLY.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.501
YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD HAVE
ANOTHER THEME NIGHT.

01:07.535 --> 01:08.702
YEAH.

01:08.736 --> 01:09.737
HEY, CLAUDIA.

01:09.770 --> 01:13.107
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
EIGHTIES DANCE NIGHT
AT THE BAR.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.642
NO.

01:18.146 --> 01:21.182
HEY, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME SO EARLY?

01:21.215 --> 01:23.217
OH, UH, THE RESTAURANT
GAVE ME MATERNITY LEAVE.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.885
OH. HOW MUCH TIME
THEY GIVE YOU?

01:24.918 --> 01:27.321
FOREVER. I GOT FIRED.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.260
ALL RIGHT,
TABLE 3 NEEDS THIS,

01:32.293 --> 01:34.362
AND TABLE 6 NEEDS GINGER
AND ALL THEIR FOOD.

01:34.395 --> 01:39.133
DO YOU MIND IF I SIT HERE
FOR A SECOND?
MY BACK IS KILLIN' ME.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.734
HI. SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.602
WHAT CAN I GET
FOR YOU?

01:41.635 --> 01:44.138
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND
THE SPICY TUNA ROLL?

01:44.172 --> 01:44.872
OHH.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.073
WELL, I'M PREGNANT,
SO, REALLY,

01:46.106 --> 01:49.177
THE THOUGHT OF RAW FISH
AND MAYONNAISE
MAKES ME WANNA PUKE.

01:49.210 --> 01:52.112
I'LL JUST HAVE
AN EEL ROLL.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.250
OK, LITTLE TO THE LEFT.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.152
UP, UP! OH! AH!

01:58.186 --> 01:59.387
OH, RIGHT THERE!
RIGHT THERE!

01:59.420 --> 02:01.622
DON'T STOP! DON'T STOP!

02:04.892 --> 02:07.195
I'M SORRY, BABE.
I KNOW WE COULD USE
THE EXTRA MONEY,

02:07.228 --> 02:10.431
BUT AT LEAST THE BAR'S
DOING OK, RIGHT?
ISN'T IT?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.466
OH! GOD, THE BAR
IS DOING GREAT.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.168
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.670
YOU KNOW, ALL YOU
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
IS JUST RELAXING

02:16.704 --> 02:17.771
AND TAKING CARE
OF THE BABY.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.174
OH, YOU'RE SWEET,
BUT JUST IN CASE,

02:20.208 --> 02:21.542
I GOT SOME OTHER
JOB LEADS.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.244
THAT'S GREAT.
YOU WANNA CALL THEM NOW?

02:23.277 --> 02:24.478
OR IN AN HOUR OR TWO.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.613
TOMORROW MORNING.
JUST RELAX.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.880
YEAH, YOU CAN CALL THEM
TOMORROW MORNING.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.917
GUYS, NO ONE GET
ON THE PHONE BETWEEN NOW
AND TOMORROW MORNING!

02:29.950 --> 02:33.721
YOUR MOM HAS SOME
VERY IMPORTANT CALLS TO MAKE!

02:35.856 --> 02:38.292
JUST REST,
FOR THE BABY.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.729
OH, GREAT.
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

02:41.762 --> 02:44.832
I REALLY MISSED SEEING
MY DAUGHTER PAWED
ON MY COUCH.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.767
WELL, GET USED
TO IT, DAD,

02:46.800 --> 02:47.901
'CAUSE BRAD'S BACK.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.938
OH. SO, I TAKE IT
YOU BROKE UP
WITH THE GIRL NEXT

02:50.971 --> 02:51.805
YEP. WASN'T EASY,

02:51.839 --> 02:54.842
BUT SOMETIMES
YOU JUST GOTTA
BE A MAN.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.676
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.246
I'M SORRY, TAYA.
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT,

02:58.279 --> 03:00.981
BUT THERE'S JUST ONE GIRL
FOR ME, AND THAT'S LILY.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.451
SHE'S SMART AND KIND
AND BEAUTIFUL,

03:03.484 --> 03:05.886
AND MY HEART'S
ALWAYS BEEN WITH HER.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.822
HOW'S THAT?
CLOSE ENOUGH.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.924
WOW. THAT WAS
REALLY MANLY.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.226
THANK YOU.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.294
BRAD!

03:13.327 --> 03:16.297
WHAT? I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP HIM
GET USED TO IT.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.431
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:17.465 --> 03:21.269
THAT'S RIGHT, DOG.
AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG
WITH THAT, HUH?

03:39.453 --> 03:40.388
HELLO, BLAKE WILLIGER?

03:40.421 --> 03:42.356
I'M CALLING ON BEHALF
OF SMS MEDICAL SERVICES

03:42.390 --> 03:43.824
ABOUT YOUR OVERDUE--
BABY, DOES THIS LOOK OK?

03:43.857 --> 03:47.461
UH, YES, ACCORDING
TO OUR RECORDS,
YOU OWE $1,200--

03:47.495 --> 03:48.496
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

03:48.529 --> 03:51.432
SOME DEADBEAT
WHO OWES MONEY.

03:51.465 --> 03:55.703
NO, A DIFFERENT DEADBEAT,
NOT YOU.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.770
HELLO?

03:56.804 --> 03:57.571
DAMN IT.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.807
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S MY NEW JOB.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.508
I'M DOING COLLECTIONS

04:00.541 --> 04:01.709
FOR A MEDICAL
BILLING COMPANY.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.878
THAT WAY, I CAN WORK
AT HOME AND THEN REST
WHEN I NEED TO.

04:04.912 --> 04:05.546
OH. DOES IT PAY OK?

04:05.579 --> 04:06.580
WELL, THAT
DEPENDS ON WHETHER

04:06.614 --> 04:08.782
I HAVE A HUSBAND
WHO UNDERSTANDS
WHAT THIS MEANS.

04:08.816 --> 04:09.683
OK, I'M SORRY.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.720
I JUST WANNA KNOW
IF THIS LOOKS ALL RIGHT.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.487
DOESN'T MATCH.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.489
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST WEAR YOUR SUIT?

04:15.523 --> 04:16.390
OH, IT'S IN THE LAUNDRY.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.758
YOU MEAN
THE DRY CLEANERS?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.059
NO, THE LAUNDRY.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.895
OK, WELL, I HAVEN'T DONE
THE LOAD OF SUITS YET,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.398
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
EITHER PUT ON BLUE PANTS

04:24.432 --> 04:25.098
OR A BLACK JACKET.

04:25.132 --> 04:25.866
OK, I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

04:25.899 --> 04:29.437
WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO DRESSED UP?

04:29.470 --> 04:30.571
OK, LOOK...

04:30.604 --> 04:33.006
T.J. SHENANIGANS IS LOOKING
FOR A NEW REGIONAL MANAGER,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.041
AND I'M GOING TO INTERVIEW.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.510
OH, MY GOD. DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE SELLING THE BAR?!

04:36.544 --> 04:39.380
ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.914
I'M SORRY.

04:40.948 --> 04:41.682
ARE YOU SELLING
THE BAR?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.617
I DON'T KNOW, BABY,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

04:43.651 --> 04:45.819
I MEAN, THIS THING PAYS
50 GRAND A YEAR WITH BENEFITS,

04:45.853 --> 04:48.422
SO I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE IT A SHOT.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.823
OH, MY GOD.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.892
WHAT ABOUT EDDIE?
WHAT DOES EDDIE THINK?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.327
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
THINK ANYTHING.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.429
ALL RIGHT? THIS IS JUST
THE FIRST INTERVIEW.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.597
I'M JUST TESTING
THE WATERS.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.498
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HIM?

04:57.531 --> 04:58.466
I'M AN ADULT.
HE'S AN ADULT.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.869
I CAN HIDE THIS FROM HIM
FOR AS LONG AS I WANT.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.006
HEY.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.107
OH, HEY, BABY.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.141
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THE BATHING SUIT

05:08.175 --> 05:09.410
I'M GONNA WEAR
TO THE BEACH PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:09.443 --> 05:13.681
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA WEAR YOUR WACKY
BERMUDA SHORTS AGAIN.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.884
NO. THIS YEAR, I'M WEARING
MY DAD'S BATHING SUIT.

05:16.917 --> 05:17.951
THE BANANA HAMMOCK?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.753
YEAH. IT MAY REQUIRE
SOME WAXING,

05:19.787 --> 05:21.989
BUT I THINK
IT'LL BE WORTH IT.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.830
HI, LILY. OH.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.931
HELLO, BRAD.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.633
TAYA.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.501
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.803
OH, I JUST CAME OVER
TO SEE MY BOYFRIEND.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.705
I THOUGHT I MADE IT
VERY CLEAR

05:37.738 --> 05:40.107
THAT BRAD DOESN'T WANNA
SEE YOU AGAIN.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.141
HEY, BABY.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.411
HEY, SWEETIE.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.847
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
MY GIRLFRIEND TAYA?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.750
YEAH,
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.386
UM, I'M GETTING A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE HERE.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.220
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.922
NO, NO, NO, IT'S
MY DAD'S BATHING SUIT.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.457
IT'S STARTING
TO CREEP UP ON ME.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.858
EXCUSE ME.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.663
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.666
UH, BABE, YOU
WANNA WAIT FOR ME
UP IN MY ROOM?

06:05.699 --> 06:06.534
OH, OK.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.835
OOH!

06:07.868 --> 06:10.003
YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR THAT LATER.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.039
SORRY, LILY.
YOU HAD A QUESTION?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.807
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

06:13.841 --> 06:16.710
TAYA'S MY GIRLFRIEND!

06:18.078 --> 06:19.813
TAYA?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.949
ARE YOU OK?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.018
I'M JUST SAD...

06:25.052 --> 06:26.754
AND A LITTLE LONELY.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.623
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

06:29.657 --> 06:30.958
RUN AWAY!

06:30.991 --> 06:33.494
NO, WAIT.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.195
GO OVER AND TALK TO HER.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.734
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:40.768 --> 06:44.071
BRAD BROKE UP WITH ME.

06:44.104 --> 06:44.805
I JUST--

06:44.838 --> 06:46.173
I NEVER SAW IT
COMING, YOU KNOW?

06:46.206 --> 06:49.977
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
HE REALLY LIKED ME.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.111
WE WENT TO THAT...

06:51.144 --> 06:54.548
I'M SO CLOSE
I CAN SMELL HER.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.650
WHAT IS THAT?

06:56.684 --> 06:58.085
CINNAMON?

06:58.118 --> 07:00.654
NO. NO, BROWN SUGAR!

07:00.688 --> 07:02.990
SHE'S A DANISH.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.158
WOW.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.994
YOU'RE A REALLY
GOOD LISTENER.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.896
SHE STOPPED TALKING.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.764
SAY SOMETHING!

07:10.798 --> 07:11.499
YEAH.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.000
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, IS IT ME?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.135
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME?

07:15.168 --> 07:17.671
NO. NO. TAYA...

07:17.705 --> 07:19.807
YOU'RE SMART.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.708
YOU SMELL LIKE FOOD.

07:20.741 --> 07:24.645
ANY GUY WOULD BE LUCKY
TO GO OUT WITH YOU.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.948
YOU'RE SWEET.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.151
UM...

07:31.184 --> 07:34.488
WOULD YOU
EVER CONSIDER...

07:34.522 --> 07:35.255
GOING OUT WITH ME?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.958
ARE YOU KIDDING?!

07:39.593 --> 07:42.830
SURE, YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.533
YEAH.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.835
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.973
THANK YOU, GOD!

07:53.006 --> 07:53.874
OK, UNLESS YOU
LEFT OUT THE PART

07:53.907 --> 07:56.243
WHERE YOU BECAME
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH,

07:56.276 --> 07:58.145
YOUR STORY DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.880
WELL, I CAN STAND HERE

07:59.913 --> 08:01.114
AND TRY TO FIGURE
IT OUT WITH YOU,

08:01.148 --> 08:05.519
OR I CAN GO UPSTAIRS
AND SMELL MY NEW GIRLFRIEND.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.523
ICK.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.559
I'M SORRY,
MRS. BLUMENTHAL,

08:11.592 --> 08:12.760
BUT ACCORDING
TO OUR RECORDS--

08:12.793 --> 08:14.728
MOM,
LISTEN TO THIS--

08:14.762 --> 08:15.996
BUT THE DOCTOR
DIDN'T WAIT 6 MONTHS

08:16.029 --> 08:17.731
TO DO YOUR OPERATION,
NOW, DID HE?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.733
MOM, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED!

08:19.767 --> 08:21.702
DOES NOBODY UNDERSTAND
THE FINGER?

08:21.735 --> 08:23.103
OK, MRS. BLUMENTHAL,
LISTEN,

08:23.136 --> 08:26.640
I'M JUST DOING
MY JOB HERE, AND--

08:27.074 --> 08:29.142
OK, I HATE THAT WORD.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.310
WELL,
THAT'S VERY MATURE.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.913
JUST KEEP SAYING IT
OVER AND OV--

08:33.781 --> 08:35.282
OK, STOP!

08:37.250 --> 08:39.219
OK, WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:39.252 --> 08:41.154
IT'S ABOUT JIMMY
AND TAYA.

08:41.188 --> 08:41.955
HE HAS GOT TO STOP
DOING THAT.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.124
YOU KNOW, SHE'S
GONNA CALL THE COPS.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.159
NO. HE'S DATING HER NOW.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.795
DOES SHE KNOW?

08:47.828 --> 08:50.097
YES. YES, IT'S REAL.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.965
HE JUST BROUGHT HER
OVER HERE.

08:51.999 --> 08:55.335
WELL, GOOD FOR HIM.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.838
NO. THIS IS
TOTALLY WEIRD.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.773
I MEAN,
HE'S A STALKER!

08:59.807 --> 09:03.176
SHE CHANGED ROOMS
'CAUSE HE WAS STARING
AT HER TOO MUCH.

09:03.210 --> 09:08.048
OR MAYBE SHE JUST WANTED
A SMALLER, DARKER ROOM.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.050
HE TRIED TO STEAL
HER GYM UNIFORM.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.785
NO, THAT WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.054
SHE WAS WEARING IT.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.124
YOU CANNOT WEAR THAT.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.892
WHY NOT?

09:18.926 --> 09:20.093
IT HAS A HOOD.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.596
IT ZIPS OFF.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.231
OK, GOOD LUCK.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.599
ALL RIGHT, BABY.
WAIT.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.934
WHAT DO I DO
IF EDDIE CALLS?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.202
DON'T WORRY ABOUT EDDIE.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.873
HEY, ED, I'M GONNA
BE A LITTLE LATE GETTIN'
IN TO WORK TODAY,

09:32.906 --> 09:33.674
'CAUSE I, UH--

09:33.707 --> 09:36.076
I HAVE TO TAKE THE CAR
INTO THE SHOP.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.211
IS THAT COOL?

09:40.013 --> 09:42.616
LET ME CALL YOU
RIGHT BACK.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.888
OK, YOU HAVE TO
STOP CURSING, OK?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.758
I AM JUST
THE COLLECTION PERSON.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.860
WELL, IF YOU SEND ME
THE $400,

09:52.893 --> 09:55.162
I WILL HAPPILY
SHOVE IT THERE.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.631
HELLO?

09:57.665 --> 09:58.732
HEY, WHAT'S
WITH THE SUIT?

09:58.766 --> 10:01.835
OH, I HAD
ANOTHER JOB INTERVIEW
AT T.J. SHENANIGANS.

10:01.869 --> 10:02.836
A SECOND INTERVIEW?!

10:02.870 --> 10:04.271
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
SELLING THE BAR!

10:04.304 --> 10:07.908
UH, AFTER TODAY,
I MIGHT NOT BE SELLING
ANYTHING TOO SOON.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.909
WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL,

10:08.942 --> 10:12.079
FIRST I FIGURED
I'D CLEAR THE AIR
WITH EDDIE.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.881
PRETTY FUNNY, HUH,
BOTH OF US SHOWING UP

10:13.914 --> 10:15.082
FOR THAT SAME INTERVIEW?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.785
YEAH, LIKE EITHER ONE
OF US WOULD WANNA WORK
IN THAT PLACE.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.086
DID YOU SEE
ALL THOSE LOSERS?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.187
"OOH, OOH,
PICK ME! PICK ME!

10:20.220 --> 10:22.022
"I WANNA SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

10:22.055 --> 10:23.791
KISSING ASS
IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT."

10:23.824 --> 10:26.426
YEAH. "I GOT ANOTHER
JACKET AT HOME.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.896
I COULDN'T FIND IT."

10:29.997 --> 10:32.032
THAT--THAT WAS ME, ED.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.035
OH, RIGHT.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.437
SO, THEY CALL YOU
TO COME BACK?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.873
NAH, I'M NOT
THE CORPORATE TYPE.

10:39.907 --> 10:40.573
THEY CALL YOU?

10:40.607 --> 10:43.110
COME ON,
LOOK AT ME.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.045
WHY, ED, WHY?

10:45.078 --> 10:46.980
WHY? WHY DO YOU
WANT THIS JOB?

10:47.014 --> 10:50.884
IS THIS MY IDEAL WAY
OF MAKING $50,000
A YEAR?

10:50.918 --> 10:51.785
NO.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.922
BUT UNTIL THEY LEGALIZE
MALE PROSTITUTION,

10:54.955 --> 10:56.389
THIS IS MY BEST SHOT.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.390
COME ON,
QUIT SCREWING AROUND.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.860
I GOT A FAMILY, MAN,
AND I GOT A KID ON THE WAY.

10:59.893 --> 11:00.894
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.230
YEAH, WELL,
WHEN I DO, I DON'T
WANNA BE CO-OWNER

11:03.263 --> 11:05.365
OF SOME DIVE BAR.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.769
NO OFFENSE.
YOU'RE DOIN' GREAT.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.937
YOU BETTER LOOK
FOR ANOTHER JOB, MAN,

11:09.970 --> 11:11.739
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
GETTING THIS ONE.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.907
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
I DON'T STAND A CHANCE

11:13.941 --> 11:15.943
AGAINST A GUY IN A SUIT
AND WHITE SOCKS.

11:15.976 --> 11:20.080
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THEY DO
DRUG TESTING HERE?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.415
ALL RIGHT, MR...

11:22.449 --> 11:23.250
FINNERTY?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.385
YES. RIGHT--
YES.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.856
HE WAS LOOKIN' AT ME.
JUST STAY BACK!

11:28.889 --> 11:30.490
OK. CONGRATULATIONS
ON MAKING IT

11:30.523 --> 11:32.159
TO THE SECOND ROUND
OF INTERVIEWS.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.094
WE'RE GONNA DO
SOME ROLE-PLAYING.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.964
SO, WHY DON'T WE START
WITH--LET'S SEE...

11:36.997 --> 11:38.165
WE HAVE EDDIE...

11:38.198 --> 11:39.366
AND SEAR.

11:39.399 --> 11:43.136
OH. THIS IS, UH, SEAN.
I'M SEAN.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.171
OH. SORRY.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.273
HE'S GOT TERRIBLE
HANDWRITING.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.075
I THINK HE STEALS, TOO.

11:48.108 --> 11:48.909
I DO--

11:48.942 --> 11:51.111
WILL YOU SHUT YOUR--
I DON'T

11:51.144 --> 11:52.179
I DON'T STEAL.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.815
GOOD. UM, WELL,
LET'S START.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.050
EDDIE, YOU'RE
A DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER.

11:57.084 --> 12:02.022
AND SEAN, AS MANAGER,
YOU DO YOUR BEST
TO ACCOMMODATE HIM.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.991
THE COMPLAINT?

12:04.024 --> 12:06.126
A DIRTY GLASS.

12:10.898 --> 12:11.631
HEY, WAITER.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.367
OH, UH, YOU MUST
BE MISTAKEN, SIR.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.036
I'M THE MANAGER.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.105
OH, I'M SORRY.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.108
THE WHITE SOCKS
THREW ME OFF.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.043
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.478
YEAH, LOOK AT THIS GLASS.
IT'S FILTHY.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.114
OH, I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.017
LET ME JUST EXCHANGE
THAT FOR YOU.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.919
HERE YOU GO.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.554
IT'S THE SAME GLASS.
NO, IT'S NOT!
IT'S A DIFFERENT ONE!

12:34.587 --> 12:35.588
I JUST GOT IT
OFF THIS TRAY.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.891
YEAH, WELL, IT'S JUST
AS FILTHY AS THE OTHER ONE.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.392
OH, FILTHY. YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT HYGIENE?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.794
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
EVERYBODY HERE

12:40.828 --> 12:41.761
ABOUT THE TIME
AT THE BAR

12:41.795 --> 12:44.364
YOU BECAME
THE HANDS-FREE
BOTTLE OPENER, HUH?

12:44.397 --> 12:48.168
HEY, AT LEAST I DON'T
HAVE SEX WITH MY WIFE
BEHIND THE BAR.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.004
OH, NO, BUT
YOU HAVE SEX WITH
OTHER PEOPLE'S WIVES

12:51.038 --> 12:52.039
ON THE BAR, HUH?

12:52.072 --> 12:53.841
I BUSTED HIM 4 TIMES
DOING THAT.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.442
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK
TO A CUSTOMER?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.911
JUST A DIRTY GLASS.
NO, NO,
YOU'RE RIGHT, ED.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.379
I WANT THIS TO GO
WELL FOR YOU,

12:59.412 --> 13:01.081
'CAUSE I KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU WANT
TO WORK

13:01.114 --> 13:03.416
FOR THIS
SOUL-SUCKING
CORPORATE HELLHOLE.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.118
THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID, RIGHT?

13:05.152 --> 13:08.188
NO, I SAID HEAVEN-HOLE.

13:08.221 --> 13:12.092
IS GOOD LISTENING
A QUALIFICATION FOR THE JOB?

13:12.592 --> 13:13.560
OK, GOOD.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.528
WHY DON'T WE GIVE CHERYL
AND BILL A CRACK AT IT,

13:15.562 --> 13:18.866
AND WE CAN SAY GOOD-BYE
TO EDDIE AND SEAR.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.067
SEAN!
HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.202
I DON'T GET TO BE
THE MANAGER?

13:22.235 --> 13:24.504
I'M SORRY, BABE.
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?

13:24.537 --> 13:26.273
NO, 'CAUSE
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

13:26.306 --> 13:29.076
WE GET TO KEEP
THE BAR.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.080
HEY, GIDGET.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.482
GINGER?

13:35.515 --> 13:37.184
MARY ANN?

13:38.085 --> 13:39.252
OK, IS THIS
A PREGNANCY THING,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.454
OR DO YOU REALLY
NOT RECOGNIZE ME?

13:41.488 --> 13:45.225
I WAS JUST MAKING--
NEVER MIND.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.126
HOW WAS THE DANCE?

13:46.159 --> 13:50.263
I'M PRETTY SURE EVERYONE
HAD A GREAT TIME.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.037
BRAD, YOU'RE GONNA
HURT SOMEBODY!

13:57.404 --> 13:58.571
SORRY.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.507
THAT'S BETTER.

14:03.110 --> 14:03.843
HEY, HEY, BILL.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.045
BILL, THIS IS
MY GIRLFRIEND TAYA.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.114
MIKE, MIKE.
I WANNA INTRODUCE YOU
TO TAYA, MY GIRLFRIEND.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.916
YOU GUYS,
I DON'T KNOW YOU,
ACTUALLY,

14:08.949 --> 14:10.083
BUT THIS IS TAYA,
MY GIRLFRIEND.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.118
YOU WANNA--YOU WANNA
MEET THE DEEJAY?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.120
UM, DO YOU WANNA
JUST DANCE?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.221
OH, YEAH. OK.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.223
OK.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.193
SISTER MARY AGNES,
THIS IS TAYA,
MY GIRLFRIEND.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.929
THAT'S TOO CLOSE.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.230
NO!

14:23.263 --> 14:24.264
NO!

14:24.297 --> 14:26.499
WOW. SOUNDS LIKE
TAYA GOT TO MEET
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.402
YES, AND SHE WASN'T
REPULSED BY JIMMY.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.271
SO, I GUESS
THEY'RE A COUPLE.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.605
LET ME LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET, LIL.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.008
THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE FINNERTY MEN

14:35.042 --> 14:36.509
THAT IS IRRESISTIBLE
TO WOMEN.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.278
BABY, WILL YOU SMELL
THE PITS ON THIS

14:38.311 --> 14:40.513
AND TELL ME IF I CAN GET
ANOTHER USE OUT OF IT?

14:40.547 --> 14:43.951
IT WEARS OFF EVENTUALLY.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.619
NO.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.688
HEY, I GOT SOME SODAS.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.158
OH, ACTUALLY, UM,
I'M GONNA GO TO THE BATHROOM.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.559
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A MINUTE.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.062
UH, CAN I HAVE MY HAND?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.396
WHATEVER YOU WANT,
BABE.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.198
OK.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.667
Lily: JIMMY,
I HAVE TO SAY,

15:00.700 --> 15:03.203
I THINK I WAS WRONG
ABOUT HER. TAYA SEEMS--

15:03.236 --> 15:05.438
SHE'S PURE EVIL!

15:07.540 --> 15:09.176
HEY, BRAD.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.110
WHERE'S LILY?

15:10.143 --> 15:11.511
UH, SHE WENT TO GO GET
SOME ICE FOR HER LEG.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.414
SHE GOT IN THE WAY

15:15.215 --> 15:15.949
WHERE'S JIMMY?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.951
OH, HE'S OVER ORDERING
EXTRA PRINTS

15:17.985 --> 15:19.452

15:19.486 --> 15:20.353
OH, COOL.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.489
SO, YOU,
UH, WANNA DANCE?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.491
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.725
OH, COME ON.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.194
ONE SONG.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.962
AS FRIENDS.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.198
ALL RIGHT.
I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,

15:31.231 --> 15:33.700
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO GET SERVED!

15:36.103 --> 15:38.305
THANKS, UH--THANKS

15:38.338 --> 15:40.573
OHH, COME ON.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.342
THAT DIDN'T COUNT.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.143

OH, GOD!

15:52.352 --> 15:54.054
OH, MY GOD! I KNEW IT!

15:54.087 --> 15:55.222
THE WORLD MAKES
SENSE AGAIN.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.223
NO. YOU'RE LYING.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.992
J-DOG, TRUST ME.

15:59.026 --> 15:59.959
DUDE, I'M SORRY.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.029
WANT ME TO GO
SMACK HER AROUND
A LITTLE BIT?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.331
NO. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.234
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS ABOUT ME

16:07.267 --> 16:09.669
THAT MAKES WOMEN
WANNA GRAB MY ASS.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.705
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE TAYA
GAVE YOU A NICE KISS.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.475
IT WAS KIND OF--
HORRIBLE!

16:16.243 --> 16:17.244
MOTHER OF GOD!

16:17.277 --> 16:20.247

16:57.784 --> 17:00.253
ISN'T THIS JOB
THE WORST?

17:00.287 --> 17:01.454
OH, MY GOD, YES!

17:01.488 --> 17:03.256
I SPEND EVERY DAY
JUST TRYING TO DEAL

17:03.290 --> 17:05.358

17:05.392 --> 17:06.659
OH, TOTALLY.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.062
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA MOVE YOUR NAME

17:09.096 --> 17:10.563
THAT SHOULD BUY YOU
A FEW MONTHS.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.565
THAT IS SO SWEET.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.703
YOU ARE THE NICEST
PERSON I'VE TALKED TO
IN 2 DAYS.

17:16.736 --> 17:17.470
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?

17:17.504 --> 17:18.538
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO TALK TO SOMEONE

17:18.571 --> 17:21.441
WHO DOESN'T WANT ME
TO SHOVE ANYTHING ANYWHERE.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.410
BABY, WHO IS IT?

17:23.443 --> 17:24.677
IT'S A COLLECTION
AGENCY.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.678
OH, GOD, GIVE ME THAT.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.847
NO, SEAN, IT'S--
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?!

17:27.880 --> 17:28.848
OH, YEAH, DO YOU?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.451
YOU'LL GET
YOUR FREAKIN' MONEY
WHEN YOU GET IT

17:31.484 --> 17:33.486
AND NOT A SECOND BEFORE,
YOU GOT THAT?!

17:33.520 --> 17:37.390
YOU CALL AGAIN,
I'M GONNA SUE YOUR ASS!

17:39.292 --> 17:41.261
THERE YOU GO, BABY.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.231
HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.700
LISTEN...

17:48.368 --> 17:49.302
I GOTTA ASK
YOU SOMETHING,

17:49.336 --> 17:52.605
AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER
COMPLETELY HONESTLY, OK?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.474
OK.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.710
DID YOU KISS BRAD
ON THE DANCE FLOOR?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.214
YES...

18:01.248 --> 18:02.682
I DID.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.686
OK, SERIOUSLY,

18:06.719 --> 18:08.655
THINK ABOUT IT
THIS TIME.

18:08.688 --> 18:13.226
DID YOU KISS BRAD
ON THE DANCE FLOOR?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.429
LOOK, JIMMY,
I'M SORRY, BUT...

18:16.463 --> 18:19.366
I THINK I STILL
REALLY LIKE BRAD.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.301
SO, YOU WERE
JUST USING ME?

18:21.334 --> 18:25.505
JIMMY, YOU'RE
A REALLY NICE GUY, BUT...

18:25.538 --> 18:27.774
THE TRUTH IS IS I WAS
ONLY GOING OUT WITH YOU

18:27.807 --> 18:30.543
SO I COULD
BE AROUND BRAD.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.349
OK. WELL...

18:36.383 --> 18:38.351
I DON'T THINK I CAN
GO OUT WITH YOU ANYMORE.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.421
ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.192
YES.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.462
OK.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.165
I UNDERSTAND.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.800
GOOD-BYE, JIMMY.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.439
GUH--OH! OK, WAIT.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.942
UM, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF THINKING
OVER THE PAST 2 SECONDS,

19:02.975 --> 19:05.612
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET BACK TOGETHER.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.946
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:06.979 --> 19:07.914
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.449
NO, I DON'T!
I MEAN, I DO,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.184
BUT IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.552
GOOD-BYE, JIMMY.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.520
NO, PLEASE DON'T GO!

19:13.553 --> 19:15.455
TAYA, YOU CAN USE ME!

19:15.488 --> 19:16.389
OK? I WANNA BE USED!

19:16.423 --> 19:18.558
YOU CAN CALL ME BRAD!
I'LL BE JUST LIKE HIM!

19:18.591 --> 19:20.793
I'LL STUDY
HIS EVERY MOVE!

19:20.827 --> 19:23.896
PLEASE!

19:26.599 --> 19:27.567
LISTEN, ED,
WE GOTTA TALK.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.769
YEAH, WE GOTTA TALK.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.505
UH, THE BAT'S
NOT DOWN THERE.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.276
LOOK, MAN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS WHOLE MESS
WITH THE INTERVIEW.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.410
YEAH, ME, TOO.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.578
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
WE'RE BROTHERS.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.547
I DON'T WANNA FIGHT
WITH YOU OVER A JOB.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.982
AND I DON'T WANNA TAKE
THE JOB AWAY FROM YOU.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.518
YEAH, WELL, IN FAIRNESS,
I THINK, UH,

19:45.552 --> 19:47.520
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
THAT JOB.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.456
YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT ABOUT..

19:49.489 --> 19:51.324
YEAH, THE BAT'S
NOT OVER THERE, EITHER.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.460
I MEAN,
WHAT WERE WE DOIN',

19:53.493 --> 19:55.262
LOOKIN' FOR ANOTHER JOB?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.496
I DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVE A JOB.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.265
THIS IS THE RED BOOT.
WE OWN IT.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.566
THIS IS--
THIS IS THE DREAM.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.868
EXACTLY.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,
WALK AWAY FROM HERE?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.504
WHAT--WHAT WOULD
OUR CUSTOMERS SAY?

20:04.537 --> 20:07.340
I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD ASK.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.275
EXCUSE ME, SIR, UH,

20:08.308 --> 20:10.777
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
IF WE SOLD THE RED BOOT?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.412
THEY'LL SEE.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.214
SOMEDAY THEY'LL ALL SEE.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.684
I THINK HE'S FINE
WITH IT.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.487
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WE SHOULD WALK AWAY?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.555
WELL, WE GOT A LOT OF EQUITY
IN THIS PLACE, MAN.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.425
WE COULD SELL, YOU KNOW,
GET THE CASH,

20:25.458 --> 20:28.395
AND THEN WE COULD DECIDE
WHERE TO GO FROM THERE.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.497
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.365
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ON.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.667
I THINK SO.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.004
TO THE RED BOOT.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.806
THE RED BOOT.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.477
MAYBE, UH,
WE COULD POOL OUR MONEY,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.346
START ANOTHER BUSINESS.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.648
WE COULD WORK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.817
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
