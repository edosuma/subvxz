00:04.000 --> 00:05.640
We had everything
we'd ever dreamed of.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.520
Apparently, he'd alsodreamed of dumping his wife

00:07.640 --> 00:08.920
in favor of fucking
some little slut

00:09.040 --> 00:10.720
who spread her legs for him.- Hello.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.200
Evan Lace.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.000
Take the bastard's lifeapart brick by brick, dollar

00:14.120 --> 00:15.000
by dollar.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.160
You need to give my son a job.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.480
I don't want a job.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.600
Why do you want your
son to work for me?

00:18.720 --> 00:19.800
To learn how to
go around the law

00:19.920 --> 00:21.400
rather than simply breaking it.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.680
We are gonna take everythinghe owns and then some.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.720
Is Dad in on this?

00:26.840 --> 00:27.600
No.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.400
Deep enough for you?

00:43.520 --> 00:44.440
Fill it in.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.720
You what?

Can't have anyone
falling into it, can we?

00:47.560 --> 00:49.200
[laughter]

00:49.320 --> 00:52.320
You make me spend
all day digging this.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.080
And now you want
me to fill it in?

00:54.200 --> 00:55.680
Yeah.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.240
You got a problem with that?

00:59.360 --> 01:00.680
Well?

01:00.800 --> 01:02.960
Don't just bloody standthere, you little tosspot.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.280
Hello?

01:05.400 --> 01:07.760
Are you Deaf or something?

01:07.880 --> 01:09.960
Fill it in.

01:10.080 --> 01:10.960
That you [inaudible]?

01:11.080 --> 01:12.240
No, it's me.

01:12.360 --> 01:16.960
Well, leave your
boots outside this time.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.800
What the hell happened to you?

01:18.920 --> 01:21.600
Bit of a difference
in opinion.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.600
What is your problem with me?

01:24.720 --> 01:26.480
You've given me nothing butshit since I've been here.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.360
Well, maybe I don't like beingtold who to have on my site.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.560
Maybe I don't like jumped-uplittle twats whose mummy

01:31.680 --> 01:32.720
and daddy are
friends with the boss

01:32.840 --> 01:34.320

01:34.440 --> 01:35.520
This is your job site, is it?

01:35.640 --> 01:37.280
You bet your life it is.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.480
Around here, what
I fucking say goes.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.800

02:02.360 --> 02:03.920
I'll fill in your hole.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.360
I'll fill it in.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.320
Oh, fuck.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.280
How's that?

02:07.400 --> 02:08.720
Fuck off.

[chatter]

02:09.800 --> 02:11.120

Huh?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.040
[inaudible]

02:13.160 --> 02:14.160
You're fired.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.200
- I don't give a shit.
- Come on.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.040
Come on.
- So you got the sack?

02:17.160 --> 02:19.320
Is that what you're saying?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.680
It was a bullshit job anyway.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.280
It was a job that got
you in the door, Wolf.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.840
No.

02:23.960 --> 02:24.960
It got me into a living hellin the middle of nowhere.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.160
It was a test.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.760
Did you not get that?

02:27.880 --> 02:30.240
Do well here, and you getone step closer to the prize.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.760
Why can't we just rob the guy?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.520
Because that's
not how this works.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.760
You were meant to
earn his trust.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.120
By digging holes in Albany?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.200
By doing whatever the
hell he told you to do.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.160
And if that takes time,
it takes time-- as long

02:40.280 --> 02:41.480
as it gets you one step closer.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.720
That was the plan.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.320
Then I fucked up
the plan, didn't I?

Watch your back when you'rewalking down the alleys.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.600
Child, watch your back.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.520
Watch your back whenyou're out on the streets.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.760
And there's danger on
the street these days.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.240
You can't see it
through the fog and haze

03:00.360 --> 03:03.240

Everybody's going crazy.

What you got for me?

03:19.080 --> 03:21.680
Bert, these are
up all over town.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.880
There are walls
that are literally

03:23.000 --> 03:24.960
more use to me than you are.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.040
So cut me loose.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.000
No.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.640
You're my man on the inside.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.520
All I do is paint
stupid placards.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.560
See?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.880
What am I looking at?

03:35.960 --> 03:36.760
evidence.

03:36.880 --> 03:37.760
Of what?

03:37.880 --> 03:39.280
That all I do is paint signs.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.120
Well, get more bloody active.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.480
Sooner or later,
these protesters are

03:42.600 --> 03:43.440
gonna start breaking the law.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.960
And I wanna know before they do.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.120
Why?

03:46.240 --> 03:47.520
So you can beat
them and leave them

03:47.640 --> 03:48.600
to die in the back of your van?

03:48.720 --> 03:49.800
I haven't got a van.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.200
A police van,
like Steve Beaker.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.200
Yeah.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.840
I know all about Steve Beaker.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.760
So the bastards put
him unconscious, naked,

03:58.880 --> 04:01.320
shackled like a slave in
the back of a police van

04:01.440 --> 04:03.520
and drove him 700
miles to Pretoria.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.760
And when they get Beaker there,and he dies from the injuries

04:06.880 --> 04:09.680
inflicted at the interrogationat Port Elizabeth,

04:09.800 --> 04:12.280
they tried to say it was becausehe was on a hunger strike.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.640
Bastards.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.240
Which is terrible
for Steve Beaker.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.520

04:18.640 --> 04:19.440

04:19.560 --> 04:20.640
The whole world should.

what I care about.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.320
Yeah.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.160
Well, I can't help you withanything this weekend anyway.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.360
Because you don't
know anything.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.680
I got that much.
- No.

so he's gone bush.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.880
And now, I've got two tickets.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.320

05:02.680 --> 05:03.520
No, you don't.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.640
Why not?

05:04.760 --> 05:05.680
Because it's full
of Australians.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.440
If you'd told me we
were expecting company,

05:13.560 --> 05:15.560
I would have made extra.
- Nah, It's OK.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.400
We've got greasies.
- Yeah.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
I can see that.

Why can't we have
fish and chips?

You can have some

Yay.

No vegetables.

in front of you.

Yes.

I'm the bad person here.

chasing protesters.

Hey, Mrs. West.

I just need to have
a word with Wolf.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.880
Could you scoot upstairs
for a bit, please?

06:03.520 --> 06:05.520
The first thing I
need you to know

06:05.640 --> 06:07.600
is that I get that
you're impatient.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.760
It was a bullshit job.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.040
No, it wasn't a bullshit job.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.560
Apparently, this is
what he always does.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.200
He gets the new boy in,gives him the lousiest job

06:15.320 --> 06:17.040
to see how he copes.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.520
According to your friend?

06:18.640 --> 06:23.120
Yes, according to my friendwho knows these things.

06:23.240 --> 06:28.040
But I'm sorry, love, if I didn'tmake that clear enough for you.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.120
So I fucked it up.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.400
Yeah, you did.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.640
Well, at least
this time, you won't

06:33.760 --> 06:34.560
have to go to prison for me.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.320
I chose the right path, Wolf.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, for something I did.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.800
For a situation that got outof control, which was my fault.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.800
No, it wasn't.

06:51.920 --> 06:52.960
It's in the past, all right?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.240
So if you ever
bring it up again,

06:54.360 --> 06:56.120
I will add to those
bruises, all right?

06:59.440 --> 07:02.920
It's history, Wolf.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.960
We move on.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.880
We move forward-- somehow.

No, can't, not tonight.

07:22.200 --> 07:22.960
OK.

07:23.080 --> 07:23.880
Maybe tomorrow.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.240
No.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.160
I'm out of town, unless
you wanna come with me.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.240
Are you on a job?

07:29.360 --> 07:30.240
Nah, nah.
Watching the rugby.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.120
Ah.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.040
I'm more of a league man.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.240
Come on.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.280
Bit of a road trip
down to Hamilton.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.720
- Hamilton?
- Yeah.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.960
For the Boks game
against Waikato.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.160
Ah.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.880
Mr. Ted is really
clear on his views

07:41.000 --> 07:42.360
about watching the evil racists.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.560
Yeah.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.840
Well, I reckon watching
the evil racists

07:44.960 --> 07:46.000
getting their head
kicked in on the pitch

07:46.120 --> 07:49.400
is just like protesting.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.800
I like your thinking.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.360
And Hamilton, I've
never been there.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.720
I mean, I've heard many
great things about it.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.680
So, yes, I am your man.

More like midmorning.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.160
OK.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.080
We leave at mid-morning.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.320
Where are you callingfrom at this time of night?

08:07.440 --> 08:10.720
I'm solving Naomi's taxproblems-- in her office.

Are you collaborating
with the guards?

08:15.280 --> 08:16.760
Mmm.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.000
If only she knew you wereabusing her trust to call me.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.720
If only.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.600
Where are we at?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.320
A crossroads.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.400
That doesn't sound good.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.480
RITA [OVER PHONE]:
It'll be fine.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.040
I'll figure something out.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.600
What about your husband?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.680
Would he be able to
help at this crossroads?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.320
No, no.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.440
And like I told you, if he comesin, he'll bring them all in.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.240
From where I'm sitting, halfof nothing is still nothing.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.920
Oh, shit, gotta go.

08:48.040 --> 08:48.880
Hmm.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.960
How nice of you to drop in.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.520
You don't mean that.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.440
Nightcap?

08:55.560 --> 08:56.360
Oh.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.640
You read my mind.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.480
Ah.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.280
A bit of a meeting
with the lads.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.560
Went on a bit longer
than I thought.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.160
Uh-huh.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.120
Hey.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.640
What's business these days?

09:09.760 --> 09:11.960
Love, you know we don'ttalk about that sort of thing.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.320
Well, what if we
did for a change?

09:14.440 --> 09:16.960
What we don't know can'tbe used against each other.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.120
That's a stupid rule.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.440
No, it's not.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.560
It's how we've lasted
all these years.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.080
And when we used to
talk about my business,

09:23.200 --> 09:24.160
you used to get all worried.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.440
No.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.000
I used to suggest
better ways of doing it.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.400
And you used to get pissed off.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.120
So then, you suddenly
decided it was better

09:30.240 --> 09:32.280
if I didn't know anything.- Yeah.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.600
And that's the way
it should stay.

09:39.840 --> 09:45.760
Well, what if I had a jobthat I wanted you to do?

09:45.880 --> 09:49.080
Have you got some knickknacksthat need [inaudible],, do you?

09:49.200 --> 09:52.400
The great china tea
set robbery of 1981.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.360
[laughter]

09:56.440 --> 09:58.760
[knocking]

09:58.880 --> 10:00.240
I was here all night.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.240
Nope.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.240
You were at the pub all night.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.120
And Lefty's.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.640
Hello.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.800
I remember you, which meansI must have the right house.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.240
Rita.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.240
Yeah, Evan.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.720
Yeah.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.640
Come in.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.320
Thank you.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.240
Sorry for the late hour.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.640
It's quite all right.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.560
Hi.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.720
How's things?

10:23.840 --> 10:24.840
All right.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.880
[CHUCKLING] Your
son, is he here?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.080
Need a word with him.
- He is.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.000
I'll go grab him.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.200
Been a while since
I've been out West.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.960
I don't suppose there's muchin Henderson for your sort.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.480
No, not since my parents died.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.080
I grew up not far
from here, actually.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.480
It's like you say--

10:48.600 --> 10:51.200
not much here for me these days.

10:51.320 --> 10:52.080
What does he want?

10:52.200 --> 10:53.400
To talk to you.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.400
What about?

10:54.520 --> 10:55.760
Oh, I don't bloody know, do I?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.200
Move.
Ugh.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.200
Wolf, move.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.120
Ah.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.120
Heard you were a sight.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.240
You should see the other guy.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.360
I did.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.440
I need you to take
a ride with me.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.640
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

11:12.760 --> 11:13.920
It's all good.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.120
It's just something
I want Wolf to see.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.680
It's the middle
of the bloody night.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.640
I do some of my best workunder the cover of darkness.

11:21.880 --> 11:25.000
You in?
- Sure.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.480
Good man.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.920
Won't keep him long.

11:46.920 --> 11:47.800
Honi.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.080
Honi.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.160
Oh, hey, Dave.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.360
How's the ribs?

11:56.480 --> 11:57.840
Yeah, still broken, thanks.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.160
Just like Steve Beaker.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.200
What?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.160
Well, you must
know exactly how

12:01.280 --> 12:02.800
Steve Beaker must have felt.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.160
Beaker died.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.600
But when the cops were
kicking him to death,

12:05.720 --> 12:07.560
you understand the pain
he was going through.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.520
Yeah.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.960
Maybe.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.240
Anyway, Honi, how areyou feeling about things?

12:12.360 --> 12:14.320
You mean stopping
the tour [inaudible]??

12:14.440 --> 12:15.640
Yes, I mean that.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.840
Ah, cool.
Loving it.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.760
Finding my artistic outlet.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.120
Right.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.080
The thing is, Honi, things areabout to go up a level now,

12:28.200 --> 12:30.360
if you know what I mean.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.800
Sure.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.520
So we're looking forpeople willing to step up.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.840
To the next level.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.960
To be in the front
lines of the next level.

12:39.080 --> 12:39.960
Ah, right, sure.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.280
I'll [inaudible] march in front.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.560
No problem.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.040
It'll be a bit more
than marching, Honi.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.440
We're looking for
people willing to go

12:47.560 --> 12:52.720
beyond the letter of thelaw for the greater good.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.720
Ah.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.640
Does that sound like
something you could do?

12:58.760 --> 13:01.040
I guess, Dave.

13:01.160 --> 13:04.560
I guess maybe I
could break the law--

13:04.680 --> 13:06.160
but only for the
greater good, eh?

13:06.280 --> 13:07.080
Good.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.640
- Yeah.
- Good.

13:08.760 --> 13:09.880
Good to know.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.040
I'll get back to you
with the details.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.720
Um, I don't know about the sign.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.640
There are women andchildren on these marches.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.440
Right.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.680
So we should probably
scrub that one.

13:21.920 --> 13:22.720
Yeah.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.200
Glove box.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.200
What?

13:58.280 --> 14:00.480
You had a shit day today.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.360
Yeah.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.640
You could say that.

14:02.760 --> 14:03.960
Getting punched
out for no reason.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.080
I punched him first.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.000
That's not what I heard.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.360
I started it.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.720
But I have
witnesses who say that

14:14.840 --> 14:18.200
[inaudible] hit
you for no reason,

14:18.320 --> 14:19.840
which is why I had to fire him.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.920
Because I don't care how farhe's got the union up his ass.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.280
You can't have that kind ofbehavior in my building site.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.960
And now, maybe things willbloody start running on time.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.000
- So I'm not fired?
- Yeah, you're fired.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.640
You can't go around
punching the foreman.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.840
OK.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.080
So why am I here?

14:44.160 --> 14:45.760
Because of this place.

14:45.880 --> 14:46.680
We're gonna buy fish?

14:50.320 --> 14:52.920
Everything to the left, I own.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.520
Everything to the right, I own.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.200
I've got plans for the lot.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.040
But this place, despite
many generous offers,

14:59.160 --> 15:04.920
they just don't share my
vision for the future.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.840
You were recommended to me asa kid who might be able to help

15:09.960 --> 15:14.160
me solve problems such as this.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.520
You want me to
threaten the guy?

15:15.640 --> 15:16.960
No.That's not how I do business.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.200
I'm not a barbarian.

15:22.280 --> 15:28.800
So maybe what if the
guy had some problems?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.960
Made him rethink whether ornot this was the best place

15:31.080 --> 15:33.120
for him to be doing business?

15:33.240 --> 15:37.720
You mean if, for example,the power to his freezer

15:37.840 --> 15:40.360
went off over the weekend,and all his fish was spoiled?

15:40.480 --> 15:45.040
Well, that'd be terrible.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.880
And smelly.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
[LAUGHING] Yeah.

15:49.120 --> 15:49.920
Yeah, that too.

16:00.160 --> 16:00.960
Not now.

16:01.080 --> 16:01.920
I'm asleep.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.480
Oh, no, you're not.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.040
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have said you were.

16:05.160 --> 16:05.960
Go away.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.240
You're pissed.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.560
I'm not so pissed
that I can't do this.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.520
No, not now.

16:17.640 --> 16:18.880
Yeah, now.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.760
No.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.720
Come on, love.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.600
You know you really want to.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.360
No, I don't.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.560
Sure, you do.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.160
You always do.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.920
Night, guys.

16:56.040 --> 16:56.960
I'll see you later.

16:57.080 --> 16:57.880
Yep.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.160
Honi.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.520
Oh, hey, Riana.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.480
Um, Dave said
he talked to you.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.360
Yep.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.520
Yeah, he did.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.680
And you're on board?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.120
Yeah, sure, all the way.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.320
Great, great.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.560
We need all the
numbers we can muster.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.600
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.920
So you gonna
drive down tomorrow?

17:17.040 --> 17:18.840
Drive down?

17:18.960 --> 17:21.280
To Hamilton tomorrow.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.720
Are you going to
Hamilton tomorrow?

17:22.840 --> 17:24.440
Yeah, of course.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.480
Aren't you?

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
For the protest?

17:26.720 --> 17:27.920
Yeah.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.440
Dave didn't talk you
through what's going on?

17:29.560 --> 17:30.560
He said he'd get back to me.And then he never did.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.880
Oh.
That OK.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.040
I can fill you in on the
way down, if you like.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.920
Yeah.

17:36.040 --> 17:40.720
The thing is, Riana,
I can't actually go

17:40.840 --> 17:42.040
with you to Hamilton tomorrow.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.000
Oh.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.600
I thought you were on board?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.680
I am-- just not tomorrow.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.000
I've got a family thing to do.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.080
What kind of thing?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.200
It must be pretty big.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.080
Yeah.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.240
It's my cousin.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.160
Died.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.600
Oh, god.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.320
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.960
What happened to him?

18:05.080 --> 18:05.880
He works in a forest.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.800
And a tree fell on him.

18:08.920 --> 18:09.760
That's terrible.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.200
Yes, it is.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.440
Of course, you need tobe with your [inaudible]..

18:13.560 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.560
Yeah, I do.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.480
Where's the tangi?

18:20.440 --> 18:21.600
[inaudible]

18:21.720 --> 18:23.840
Your cousin'sNgatierangi [inaudible]??

18:23.960 --> 18:25.720
Yep, sure.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.000
But when I say cousins, wearen't actually related.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.880
We just kind of grew up togetherin the same house in Henderson.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.800
We was just close, real close.

18:35.920 --> 18:39.840
Yeah, I get that.

18:39.960 --> 18:40.800
Come here.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.320
Kia kaha.

18:49.440 --> 18:53.040
Yeah, kia kaha to you too, eh?

18:53.160 --> 18:55.560
You bet we'll be strong.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.960
Tomorrow, we're gonna
show those bastards

18:57.080 --> 18:58.840
just what their fascist
tour means to the people

18:58.960 --> 18:59.840
of [inaudible].

18:59.960 --> 19:01.400
For sure.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.480
And you and me, we'll haveother future protests together,

19:03.600 --> 19:05.000
right?

19:05.120 --> 19:06.840
Unless they choose to cancelthe tour after tomorrow.

19:06.960 --> 19:07.720
Ha.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.760
Yeah, right.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.120
Seriously.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.640
It's just a pity you
won't be there for it.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.800
I kind of like the idea
of you and me, side

19:16.920 --> 19:18.600
by side, making history.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.000
How'd you get on?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.160
Well, I'm in.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.240
I never doubted
you for a second.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.160
So now what?

19:36.280 --> 19:38.480
He has assets everywhere.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.960
There are cars on a
ship somewhere up North.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.080
There's his boat.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.720
There's the art.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.360
Evan likes things.

19:47.480 --> 19:52.440
He puts his money into stuff,and then he hides his stuff.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.680
So we find where everythingis, and we steal it?

19:54.800 --> 19:55.560
Yep.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.920
There'll be a safe.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.280
Because his stuff, he
likes to keep close by.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.000
There'll be two things for sure.

20:02.120 --> 20:07.960
One is my jewelry, the
stuff he gave to me

20:08.080 --> 20:09.520
and then kept when that
little whore came along

20:09.640 --> 20:12.200
and spread her legs for him.

20:12.320 --> 20:19.120
You can keep everything else,but I want my jewelry back.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.600
What's the other thing?

20:22.720 --> 20:24.600
Bearer bonds.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.080
What the hell
are bearer bonds?

20:26.200 --> 20:28.520
They're his rainy day fund.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.520
Each one of these pieces ofpaper is worth a lot more money

20:31.640 --> 20:34.120
than you can carry
around in a suitcase.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.720
And Evan has a pile
of these bearer bonds,

20:36.840 --> 20:39.440
worth many suitcases
of actual money.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.480
But what if he cancels them?

20:41.600 --> 20:42.840
He can't cancel them.

20:42.960 --> 20:47.000
Whoever has the
bond owns the bond.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.600
There are no records, Rita.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.400
Bye bye, rainy day fund.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.760
And we're gonna
make it rain so hard.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.480
Men are pigs.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.760
No way am I ever
getting married.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.560
Where are you going?

21:11.680 --> 21:13.240
Visiting.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.840
Any chance of a cup
of tea before you go?

21:19.280 --> 21:21.200
Is it wrong I told my parentsI was going on a church trip?

21:21.320 --> 21:23.840
Yeah, the church of rugby.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.040
I'm very excited
to go to Hamilton.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.240
Really?

21:27.360 --> 21:29.400
I've never been
south of [inaudible]..

21:29.520 --> 21:31.440
Everything beyond the BombayHills is a mystery to me.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.440
Yeah.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.800
Well, don't get your hopes up.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.440
[tires squealing]

21:35.560 --> 21:36.960
FALANI: Did you know Hamiltonis called the Fountain City?

21:37.080 --> 21:40.480
I look forward to seeing
the many fountains.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.840
So what's the job?

21:41.960 --> 21:44.560
Who are we robbing today, boss?

21:44.680 --> 21:45.840
Nothing.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.920
You said there'd
be money in it.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.240
There is.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.960
I've been hired to do
a very specific job.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.000
You got everything you need?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.040
Oh, yeah.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.400
All good.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.520
It's Sparky's time to shine.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.480
[whirring]

22:03.600 --> 22:04.880
We're, uh, going now.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.680
I'm not gonna kiss
you goodbye, Eric.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.600
Ah, it was worth a shot.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.480
Bye.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.560
See you, Sparky.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.680
[SINGING] Come on, [inaudible]

22:26.720 --> 22:38.160
Come on [inaudible]

22:38.280 --> 22:39.040
Hi.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.440
Hi.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.760
Thank you for
agreeing to meet me.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.880
That's quite all right.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.600
Were you just singing?

22:46.720 --> 22:48.080
Yes, I suppose I was.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.840
Is this something
you do often?

22:49.960 --> 22:51.080
Sing to yourself?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.680
No, no.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.640
I used to.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.960
I used to sing all the time.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.200
Don't do it anymore.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.120
Pity.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.800
Sounded pretty good.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.280
[inaudible]

23:02.400 --> 23:04.280
When I was young, Rita and Iused to go to all the dances.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.240
And I wanted to be [inaudible]--

23:06.360 --> 23:09.200
the haircut, the
clothes, everything.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.480
Her life was gonna be my life.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.240
Funny how things turn out, eh?

23:14.360 --> 23:18.240
I was gonna open the[inaudible] for New Zealand.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.680
That never happened.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.360
What can I do for you, Ngaire?

23:30.760 --> 23:32.640
If I'm wrong, you andthe boys down the station

23:32.760 --> 23:34.960
can have a good laugh atstupid, bloody Ngaire Munroe.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.960
I don't care.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.920
But if I'm right, I wantyou to be honest with me.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.560
About what?

23:42.680 --> 23:44.640
In our recent dealings, Ivery much got the impression

23:44.760 --> 23:50.760
that you were attracted to me.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.600
Was I wrong about this?

23:52.720 --> 23:57.800
Um, well-- well, you'rea bloody attractive woman,

23:57.920 --> 23:59.320
Ngaire.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.040
I'd be a [inaudible]
if I wasn't--

24:01.160 --> 24:04.600
attracted to you, that is.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.920
What I'm saying
here is that I need

24:09.040 --> 24:12.200
someone to be attracted to me--

24:12.320 --> 24:14.400
as me, for what I am--

24:17.920 --> 24:19.200
before I quietly go mad.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.360
There's no hidden plan.
I just need to know.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.480
That's all.

24:28.600 --> 24:33.920
And if I say, yes, I findyou very attractive, then what?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.160
Well, then I guess I
would have to tell you

24:36.280 --> 24:38.520
that there's no and in this--

24:38.640 --> 24:40.720
as in, and I'm going to tellyou all about my husband

24:40.840 --> 24:43.120
and what he's up to.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.040
To be honest,
if I was with you,

24:45.160 --> 24:48.440
Lefty would be the last thingI'd want to think about.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.360
So?

24:51.480 --> 24:56.040
So, yes, I find
you very attractive--

25:00.120 --> 25:01.800
terribly, terribly attractive.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.240
What are you doing
this afternoon?

25:08.360 --> 25:09.680
Oh.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.080
I was gonna watch therugby at the police club,

25:12.200 --> 25:14.400
although I could change that.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.280
Any chance you
might be watching

25:16.400 --> 25:17.800
the game at your house?

25:17.920 --> 25:19.520
Yeah, could be.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.400
Got your notebook?

25:20.520 --> 25:22.040
Always.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.480
Why?

25:23.600 --> 25:24.640
You'll need to writedown your address for me.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.000
Yeah, of course.

25:34.440 --> 25:37.160
There's a 50/50 chanceI'll come watch with you.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.920
Only 50/50?

25:39.040 --> 25:41.440
Best odds I can
offer, I'm afraid.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.720
Are you sure you
bypassed the alarm?

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
Yes.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.200
But are you sure sure?

26:03.320 --> 26:04.800
I mean, you are only an
apprentice electrician.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.880
Yes, I'm sure sure.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.040
OK.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.240
There's only one
way we'll find out.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.400
Eric, shut the fuck up.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.640
Yeah.
I'm just saying.

26:10.760 --> 26:11.800
That's all.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.560
I never had a doubt.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.080
What if someone
outside sees the lights

26:27.200 --> 26:28.760
on on a Saturday afternoon?

26:28.880 --> 26:32.400
What if someone outside hearsus clunking around in the dark?

26:32.520 --> 26:33.680
You know what to do?

26:33.800 --> 26:34.640
It has to look like a fault.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.560
Oh, it will.

26:40.080 --> 26:40.960
Mm.

26:41.080 --> 26:41.920
Hey.

26:42.040 --> 26:42.760
Let's take a couple of fish.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.680
No, nothing.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.440
[inaudible] fish.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.040
No, no trace we
were ever here.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.680
Just one, for dinner.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.560
No.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.480
Ugh.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
I love fish.

26:51.720 --> 26:52.760
- Too bad.
- Oh.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.880
It just seems such a waste.

26:54.000 --> 26:54.760
That's the point.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.960
[squealing]

26:57.080 --> 26:59.400

27:00.840 --> 27:01.600
Good burger.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.000
Mm.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.520
Maybe it is becausethe cows are closer here.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.120
Eh?

27:07.240 --> 27:08.200
They don't have to travelso far to be tuned into meat.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.120
[background shouting]

27:09.240 --> 27:11.040
OK, if you say so.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.880
I expected more fountains.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.120
Shit.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.440
Is it the pigs?

27:19.560 --> 27:20.880
[shouting]

27:22.200 --> 27:23.400
Shit.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.880

just go with it, OK?

27:26.000 --> 27:26.840

27:26.960 --> 27:29.800

27:49.400 --> 27:50.720
Well, what about the tangi?

27:50.840 --> 27:52.960
Um, it got called off.

27:53.080 --> 27:53.880
Really?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Why?

27:55.120 --> 27:57.040
Yeah, my cousin,
he's not dead.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.160
Really?

27:58.280 --> 27:59.520
Yeah.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.080
Lost a leg.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.400
One of the rellies
thought he was dead.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.600
So they called
the other rellies.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.280
And it was, um, a
misunderstanding.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.800
That's great-- um, not
about your cousin's leg.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.040
But you're here.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.360
Where else would I be?

28:12.480 --> 28:15.080

Yeah, afraid so.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.240
Oh, no, you suit it.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.040
We should get to the game.

Yes, to the game.

Kids are at my sister's.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.520
Good.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.760
You'll get some peace and quiet.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.200
Don't go to the pub.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.400

We can drink martinis, andyou can explain the rules.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.440
The thing is, they're soft.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.000
Who are?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.560
The Boks because they onlyever play with themselves.

30:00.680 --> 30:01.600
Wasn't that meant
to make you hard?

30:01.720 --> 30:03.160
- Eh?
- Playing with yourself.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.480
No, no, no, not like that.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.080
Because no one wants
