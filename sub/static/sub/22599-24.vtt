Sings the song
That the world wants to hear

19:10.359 --> 19:13.612
Let's not fight
Let's get along

19:13.821 --> 19:17.991
For our hypnotic profiteer

19:19.076 --> 19:21.328
Using Black Canary
as an instrument of evil...

19:21.537 --> 19:23.163
...you corrupt conductor.

19:23.372 --> 19:26.125
But if you expect me to play along
with your twisted tune...

19:26.333 --> 19:28.794
...she'll have to sing as high as me.

Put a sock in it.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.056
You've done it again, hero.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.851
And that's some set of pipes
you're sporting there.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.479
Actually, I'm more of a baritone.
I was only able to match your voice...

20:29.688 --> 20:32.858
...with the use of this
Bat Auto-Tuning Amplifier.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.445
Such a clever boy.

20:36.653 --> 20:41.366
Since the day's been saved,
what do you say we grab a bite?

20:42.367 --> 20:46.205
Sorry, crime doesn't take dinner breaks,
and neither do I.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.041
Until next time, Canary.

Look at him

20:53.420 --> 20:55.797
He saved the clay

20:57.716 --> 21:03.096
Kept all evil far away

21:04.932 --> 21:07.434
A brave man

21:07.684 --> 21:10.771

I could take you away

21:37.965 --> 21:41.760
A fairy voice carries

21:41.969 --> 21:44.471
I'd marry

If only

21:54.273 --> 22:00.070
