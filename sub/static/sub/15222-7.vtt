<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:04.938 --> 00:08.772
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.842 --> 00:10.833
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.949 --> 00:18.782
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.685
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.755 --> 00:26.954
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:32.293
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.365 --> 00:36.768
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.836 --> 00:41.170
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:44.976
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.445
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.514 --> 00:49.505
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:56.189 --> 00:59.386
<i>Whoa! Watch out!</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:05.558
Shut the engine! Shut it
down! What, are you crazy?

01:05.632 --> 01:07.566
<i>You all right, Jimmy?</i>

01:07.634 --> 01:10.125
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm
sorry. Everybody all right?

01:10.203 --> 01:12.330
<i>Yeah, we're okay.
Yeah, we're all right.</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:15.397
Didn't I tell you to stay away from the forklift?
You're not ready to drive it yet.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.466
Frank?
What?

01:17.544 --> 01:20.479
Is that you? Of course it's
me. Did you hit your head?

01:20.547 --> 01:22.981
No. No, I-

01:23.049 --> 01:25.517
No, I- I didn't-

01:25.585 --> 01:28.952
Jimmy. Jimmy.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.752
I know you'reJimmy. And
I'm back! I'm back, Frank!

01:31.825 --> 01:33.690

That paperwork come in?</i>

03:01.080 --> 03:04.880
Yeah, it's over there.
Are you okay, Jimmy?

03:04.951 --> 03:06.885
Yeah, he's fine, he's fine.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.114
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I'm fine.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.589
Did you read
your newspaper today?

03:11.658 --> 03:14.718
Uh, the newspaper?

03:14.794 --> 03:19.424
<i>Yeah. You know Mrs. LaMotta. She always packs
a little article for you to read in your bag.</i>

03:19.499 --> 03:22.059
This is it. Here it is.
Mrs. LaMotta. Connie!

03:22.135 --> 03:24.069
Connie. Her-Her name's Connie.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.628
Yeah, her name's Connie.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.697
Are you sure you're okay?
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.709
I am really fine.
All right.

03:30.777 --> 03:33.746
Okay, well, you, uh,
give me a call if you need anything.

no one wanted to accept him.</i>

03:42.355 --> 03:44.653
<i>They called him moron and retard.</i>

03:44.724 --> 03:49.218
<i>Things sure seem different now.</i>

03:49.295 --> 03:52.992
Sam, this is amazing. In
over 80 leaps, Keep it down.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.261
You've never leaped to the
same place... Keep it down.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.326
More than once until now.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.564
Oh, yeah. There's Jimmy.
That's really nice.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.472
This is great! Yeah, well,
Ziggy doesn't think so.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.375
As a matter of fact, she's freaked
out by the whole thing. Oh, Ziggy.

04:05.445 --> 04:10.314
She's in maximum overload. I've even had Dr.
Beeks talking to her, but it's not helping.

04:10.383 --> 04:14.615
Look at this, Al. "Jimmy, read this,
and we'll talk about it. Love, Connie. "

04:14.687 --> 04:18.748
- Jimmy's learning about the space program.
- What about the space program?

04:18.825 --> 04:22.454
Oh, nothing. Just that Connie
gave me this article to read.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.587
<i>"Gemini VIII Makes Emergency Landing. "</i>

04:24.664 --> 04:29.033
Great. She remembers your
article, but she forgets my lunch.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.764
"Neil Armstrong guides craft
to a safe landing in the Pacific. "

04:31.838 --> 04:33.863
That's right. I forgot.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.569
<i>Armstrong was in the Gemini program
before he flew Apollo to the moon.</i>

04:37.644 --> 04:43.105
Flew to the moon? Jimmy, you been
reading too many of Corey's comic books?

04:43.182 --> 04:46.174
Well, you know,
it could happen someday.

04:46.252 --> 04:50.188
Yeah? Better not let Dr. Smithfield
hear you talking like that.

04:50.256 --> 04:52.520
No. No, you're right.
I'm just kidding anyway.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.526
I'm fooling around.
It's kind of-

04:54.594 --> 04:58.325
Corey and I have this, you know,
fly to the moon game that we-we do.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.798
<i>You want to look at these
before you go, Frankie?</i>

05:00.867 --> 05:03.665
<i>"Frankie"?
I want to put this off until tomorrow.</i>

05:03.736 --> 05:05.966
I want to getJimmy home
early for dinner. What?

05:06.039 --> 05:08.132
You've been eating
chocolate doughnuts again.

05:08.207 --> 05:11.973
Dinner!
Connie's a great cook.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.809
I can't wait to see her.
Yeah, I bet she is.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.815
Come on, Frank.
Let's go.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.874
<i>This is not my idea of fun.</i>

05:18.951 --> 05:21.511
<i>I hate cooking,
and I hate doing the wash.</i>

05:21.587 --> 05:23.521
We're in the dark ages, darling.

05:25.692 --> 05:29.423
Hang those jockeys high. You're
really enjoying this, aren't you?

05:29.495 --> 05:31.895
Don't take your frustrations
out on me.

05:31.964 --> 05:34.558
I'm just a chick who loves the '60s.

05:34.634 --> 05:36.602
I'd love to see you
play the good little housewife.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.900
No, thanks, darling.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.202
Not my style.

05:42.275 --> 05:48.043
- Mind you, looks as if it might have some nice fringe benefits.
- No, it doesn't.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.174
<i>Did I ever tell you about the hunk
who lives downstairs in my building?</i>

05:51.250 --> 05:56.210
He needed some laundry powder, so I offered to
wash his clothes, as long as he took them off first.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.723
I don't have time for this.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.918
<i>He looked fab in bubbles.</i>

06:00.993 --> 06:03.791
Oh. Here's Frank.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.923
Oh. Well, I better be on my way.
If you're a good little girl,

06:06.999 --> 06:10.435
when I come back, I might tell you about
how I helped the phone man pull cable.

06:13.740 --> 06:18.177
I told him once, I told him
a thousand times about that bike.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.178
Corey!

06:23.916 --> 06:27.215
Hey, you just gonna
sit in there forever?

06:29.288 --> 06:31.222
He always leaves his bike there.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.690
What did you say?
Nothin'.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.059
I'm coming. I said, I'm
coming. Okay? I'll get this.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.928
<i>Hey, Jimmy.!
No, leave that alone.</i>

06:39.999 --> 06:41.933
Connie!

06:42.001 --> 06:44.993
You look-
You look just the same.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.835
Just the same as what?

06:47.907 --> 06:51.570
The same as you did
this morning at breakfast.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.442
Jimmy, are you all right? Yeah, he's
still a little shook-up, I think.

06:54.514 --> 06:59.178
Shook-up? What happened? Mr. Big Stuff
nearly drove a forklift off the pier.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.186
What? Are you okay?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.052
<i>Being back at Frank and Connie's
feltjust like going home,</i>

07:04.123 --> 07:06.057
<i>except for the cooking.</i>

07:06.125 --> 07:08.059
<i>Women's lib had hit suburbia.</i>

07:08.127 --> 07:10.721
<i>I hadn't eaten a TVdinner
since I was 11.</i>

07:10.797 --> 07:14.289
<i>Mom said they were disgusting, but I always
thought they were food from the future.</i>

07:14.367 --> 07:17.427
- I love these potatoes.
- You could have mine.

07:19.539 --> 07:23.669
What, you're not hungry? It tastes
like rubber. I'm sick of this stuff.

07:23.743 --> 07:26.837
If you don't eat what's in front of you,
you can go to bed hungry.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.278
Look, hon, can we-

07:31.350 --> 07:33.284
can we try something different
for a change?

07:33.352 --> 07:35.377
You want to have
something different?

07:36.522 --> 07:39.685
Then why don't you stay home
and cook dinner, huh?

07:39.759 --> 07:43.525
Okay. Then maybe you can go to work
for me around the dock. How about that?

07:43.596 --> 07:46.497
I am trying to helpJimmy. It takes
a lot of time and a lot of effort.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.535
Yeah, well,
you're pushing him too hard.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.799
Did you read that stuff about the
space program I gave you today?

07:52.872 --> 07:55.534
Yeah.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.076
Did you understand it?

07:59.812 --> 08:03.646
<i>Gemini VllI had to make an emergency landing.
They had a problem with their thrusters.</i>

08:05.017 --> 08:07.986
That's wonderful!
Aren't you proud of him?

08:08.054 --> 08:10.420
All we have to do is push
him a little more. He's great.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.051
<i>Yeah, that's right, Connie. And he nearly
drove a forklift off the pier today.</i>

08:14.126 --> 08:17.027
He could have killed himself. You
know, you're pushing him too hard.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.929
You're trying to build up
a false confidence.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.934
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.563
Just leave that to the doctor. Your job is
supposed to be here taking care of the house.

08:26.639 --> 08:30.268
<i>I mean, look at this place.!
It's a mess.!</i>

08:34.580 --> 08:39.448
You know, maybe Corey and I could
help out a little bit. Right, Corey?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.453
Sure.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.116
All right.
You can start by clearing the table.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.192
Thanks.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.061
When are you going to stop
acting like a spoiled child?

08:53.132 --> 08:55.259
Just as soon as you
start acting like a wife.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.632
What's that supposed to mean?
You know exactly what it means.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.728
No. Come on. Spell
it out for me. Corey.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.239
You need me to spell it out for you?
I'd be happy to do that!

09:02.308 --> 09:05.106
Go ahead!
I'm sick of your threats!

09:05.177 --> 09:08.476
<i>You hear me? I'm sick of
coming home to a dump.!</i>

09:08.548 --> 09:11.608
<i>Then why don't you clean
it up? That's not myjob.!</i>

09:11.684 --> 09:14.118
Hey, ball game's on
in a couple minutes.

09:14.186 --> 09:17.485
<i>Now it's Corey's fault. Why can't
you ever take the blame for something?</i>

09:17.557 --> 09:19.491
<i>Why me? Why-</i>

09:19.559 --> 09:22.460
Think the Giants are gonna win
the pennant this year?

09:24.096 --> 09:26.223
If I run away,
will you come with me?

09:26.299 --> 09:29.632
Run away? Why?

09:29.702 --> 09:31.795
Because of what happened in there?

09:31.871 --> 09:35.568
<i>I hate it when they fight.
Everybody fights now and then.</i>

09:35.641 --> 09:40.704
- Even you and me.
- But that's not the same thing.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.681
- They're always fighting.
- It can't be that bad.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.809
Oh, come on, Jimmy.
You don't remember last night?

09:46.886 --> 09:50.617
You said all the yelling hurt your ears,
and you climbed under your bed.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.490
That was the third time this week.
Wait. Wait a second.

09:55.561 --> 09:59.088
Sometimes people- parents...

09:59.165 --> 10:05.104
go through some hard times,
and it makes them act a little weird,

10:05.171 --> 10:07.366
but it doesn't mean
that they don't love you.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.473
But... Mom doesn't love me.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.173
Of course she does.

10:15.247 --> 10:18.182
She used to,
but she's always getting mad at me.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.445
Look, she's not-

10:20.519 --> 10:24.114
She's not really mad a-a-at you.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.283
But she acts like
I'm not even there.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.692
Sometimes I feel it might be better
if I just went away.

10:29.762 --> 10:32.663
No. No. Don't you see?

10:32.732 --> 10:35.929
If you went away,
your mom would really miss you.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.368
And-and so would your dad,
and-and I would too.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.837
Would you?
Of course I would.

10:40.906 --> 10:45.673
Besides, if you weren't here,
who would I steal mashed potatoes from?

10:46.746 --> 10:48.737
I love you, UncleJimmy.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.941
<i>I love you too, Corey.</i>

10:51.017 --> 10:53.679
<i>Sam, I think we better have a little talk.</i>

10:55.655 --> 10:59.182
Listen, why don't you go inside,
okay? Turn the ball game on.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.284
I'll go around back to the kitchen
and find us something to eat.

11:02.361 --> 11:06.991
Some ice cream. Mom
didn't buy any ice cream.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.796
Well, there must be some kind
of junk food in there somewhere.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.429
<i>- What's junk food?
- Junk food. You know.</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:17.238
Uh, ice cream, potato chips-
junk food.

11:17.309 --> 11:22.178
Oh. I think I might have some ice cream
sandwiches left over from my birthday party.

11:22.248 --> 11:25.615
Is that junky enough?
That's the junkiest.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.846
Cool!

11:27.920 --> 11:30.445
I would like to personally thank you
for introducing...

11:30.523 --> 11:35.392
such an intellectually stimulating colloquialism
as "junk food" to the English language.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.294
Al, I was wrong about this leap.
Things aren't terrific here.

11:38.364 --> 11:43.597
In fact, things are pretty lousy.
Tell me something I don't know.

11:43.669 --> 11:47.799
- What does that mean?
- It means that we still don't know what the hell is going on with Ziggy.

11:47.873 --> 11:52.003
<i>Dr. Beeks got such a shock from her,
it knocked her halfway across the room.</i>

11:52.078 --> 11:55.047
Ziggy- She's in a total state
of confusion.

11:55.114 --> 11:59.915
Confusion about what? Well, she's
insisting that history's changing.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.818
So whatever you're doing, you
better stop it. I ate a TV dinner.

12:02.888 --> 12:07.450
Is that changing history? No, but
something sure as hell is going on,

12:07.526 --> 12:12.156
because originally, Ziggy said
Connie and Frankie lived happily ever after.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.961
Jimmy got his own place.
Corey went on to Stanford.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.831
Everything fine.
So what's changing?

12:16.902 --> 12:20.429
Everything!
Now Connie and Frankie break up.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.373
Uh, and Corey-

12:23.442 --> 12:28.072
Uh, we can't trace anything that happens to him.
Jimmy. What aboutJimmy?

12:28.147 --> 12:31.776
Well, Jimmy blamed himself
for the breakup,

12:31.851 --> 12:36.584
and three weeks after the divorce
he was institutionalized.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.419
He- He never got out.

12:46.532 --> 12:50.263
<i>- It isn't fair, Al.
Man Announcing Sports, Indistinct]</i>

12:50.336 --> 12:52.804
Cupboard's bare. I mean, I
leap back to people that I know,

12:52.872 --> 12:54.806
and everything
should be great, right?

12:54.874 --> 12:58.002
<i>But everything's wrong.</i>

13:02.214 --> 13:04.444
LaMotta Residence.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.008
Who's calling, please?

13:07.086 --> 13:10.783
All right, Shirley. Just a sec.
Frank's secretary?

13:10.856 --> 13:12.790
I mean, uh, hi, Shirley.

13:12.858 --> 13:18.228
Shirley Constantine, 21, 25, Sawyer Secretarial School
- How you doing? Yeah.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.492
High school gymnastics champion.
Yeah, uh-

13:20.566 --> 13:24.024
Mmm.
Yeah, uh, let me go get him, okay?

13:24.103 --> 13:26.970
No, no! Don't do that!
Uh- Uh, tell her that he's not here.

13:27.039 --> 13:32.477
Why? Because Ziggy says that Frankie leaves
Connie for this one- this- this Shirley.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.509
Uh, Shirley?
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.

13:38.584 --> 13:41.314
<i>I was wrong. He's not here.
He went, um-</i>

13:41.387 --> 13:43.321
He went bowling.
Bowling. He's bowling.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.323
<i>Who is it, Jimmy?
Uh, nobody.</i>

13:45.391 --> 13:48.417
It's just a friend of mine. Remember,
she's a gymnast. They're very limber.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.428
Okay. I'll call you back.
Thanks. Bye-bye.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.430
W- W-Wait.
Hello? Hello?

13:52.498 --> 13:56.867
No, it's okay. It's, uh-
Jimmy was just fooling around.

13:56.936 --> 14:00.428
Yeah. Hey, Jimmy, why don't you go
watch the ball game with Corey?

14:00.506 --> 14:03.373
I gotta get some
ice cream sandwiches.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.913
Hey. Yeah, listen, uh,

14:10.983 --> 14:13.417
tomorrow might be tough.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.420
Yeah, I know I promised.
Frankie, don't do it.

14:16.488 --> 14:19.389
I thought your brother was gonna
help you move. Good. That's better.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.723
That's better.
Mm-hmm.

14:22.795 --> 14:27.255
Yeah. Okay, well, I'll, uh, be there
first thing in the morning, all right?

14:27.333 --> 14:31.394
This is bad, Sam, because when people are
moving, they get hot and they get sweaty.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.404
When they get hot and sweaty,
they start breathing hard.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.406
When they're hot and sweaty
and breathing hard,

14:35.474 --> 14:37.704
they're gonna want to take
a shower. I'll be there.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.937
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

14:40.012 --> 14:43.209
- I gotta go.
- Do something, Sam.

14:43.282 --> 14:46.217
<i>Bye. Bye.</i>

14:46.285 --> 14:50.244
I'll help.
Help?

14:50.322 --> 14:52.813
Yeah, I'll help you move Shirley
into her new apartment.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.292
How- How did you know-

14:55.361 --> 14:58.762
I'm really strong.
Yeah.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.823
L- I don't think so.
I don't think so, Jimmy.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.301
I bet if I ask Connie, I'll
bet she'll let me go. No, no.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.702
You don't have to bother
Connie with this, you know?

15:06.772 --> 15:10.731
Uh, I'll tell you what. Why don't
- This will just be our little secret, okay?

15:10.809 --> 15:12.834
'Cause
- What are you two whispering about?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.779
Hmm? Oh, nothing.
We were just-

15:15.848 --> 15:19.409
Nothing. We were just horsing around. Look,
the ball game started five minutes ago.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.953
That's mine, right? Huh?

15:22.021 --> 15:24.012
Yeah, this is yours.

15:30.062 --> 15:33.793
<i>Frank.! Frank, wait a minute.
Where are you going?</i>

15:33.866 --> 15:37.529
Just going to run some errands, that's
all. He's supposed to practice his reading.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.299
Dr. Smithfield says it's important
for him to practice every day.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.863
Yeah, you know,
she's got a point there, pal.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.935
Why don't we, uh-
We should do what the doctor says.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.106
I want to run errands.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.582
Don't you want to get better?

15:55.054 --> 15:57.420
He wants to run errands.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.890
That heavy?

16:10.436 --> 16:14.634
Bend your knees now when you pick it
up. It takes pressure off the brain.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.666
Thanks, Al. Thanks for
the wonderful tip. Okay.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.042
How's Ziggy doing?

16:21.113 --> 16:24.844
Ziggy is still totally
overamped trying to catch up.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.908
She still says history is changing.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.920
How could history be changing?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.388
All I've been doing is dragging
hundred-pound boxes...

16:31.457 --> 16:34.392
up the longest flight of stairs
in the history of the world...

16:34.460 --> 16:37.190
just so that Shirley can tell me
to go back down and get some more...

16:37.262 --> 16:39.696
so that she and Frank
can unpack together.

16:39.765 --> 16:44.862
Well, four airline crashes,
an outbreak of Rangoon flu,

16:44.937 --> 16:47.633
Three earthquakes
and 17 floods.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.539
All because I didn't bend my knees?
Right.

16:50.609 --> 16:53.908
I think Ziggy has finally lost it.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.904
I just don't get it, Al.

16:56.982 --> 17:02.420
I mean, I don't see how Frank
could even think about leaving Connie.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.588
I mean, she's wonderful,
she's sweet, she's caring.

17:06.657 --> 17:09.786
<i>I don't think sweet and caring
is what Frankie needs right now.</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:15.198
Connie should realize that sometimes it's
easier to be a mother than it is to be a wife.

17:15.267 --> 17:19.294
How would you know? My fourth wife
used to try and mother me all the time.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.965
She used to cut my steak for me
when we went out to dinner.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.603
- That's how come I don't eat meat.
- All I'm saying, Al, is...

17:26.678 --> 17:29.078
that if I were Frank,
I wouldn't let this happen.

17:31.050 --> 17:36.989
Uh, don't you think it's time you checked
on Romeo and the femme fatale up here?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.786
Stop worrying about them. I'm
right here. What are they gonna do?

17:39.858 --> 17:42.326
I'm worried, I'm worried.
It's my job to be worried.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.828
It seems like you're worried
more than you usually are.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.765
I'm worried because I can't figure out
what the hell is happening here.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.396
And I'm also worried because...

17:52.471 --> 17:56.965
I've never really cared about anyone
you've leaped into like I care aboutJimmy.

17:58.043 --> 18:02.070
Because... he reminds you
of your sister?

18:02.147 --> 18:04.138
You remember Trudy?

18:04.216 --> 18:08.346
Well, I remember you
telling me about her.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.547
How-How she got sick.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.613
Yeah, she got pneumonia.

18:12.691 --> 18:17.458
Then they took her out of the orphanage
and put her in the mental hospital.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.497
That was the last time I ever saw her.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.500
I mean, Jimmy's a-
He's a good kid.

18:22.568 --> 18:26.504
I wouldn't want to see
anything bad happen to him.

18:27.639 --> 18:30.972
We won't let it, Al.
We won't let it.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.540
That should do it.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.844
It sure is nice having
a man around the house.

18:37.916 --> 18:42.717
<i>Especially one like you.
Hi.</i>

18:42.788 --> 18:46.554
Jimmy, be careful.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.361
That's the last box.
I think we should go, huh?

18:51.430 --> 18:55.423
Uh, Jimmy, could you be a
sweetie and go down to the market?

18:55.501 --> 18:58.493
I bet we could all use
a soda pop about now.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.504
No, thanks.
I'm not thirsty.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.904
Come on, Jimmy.
Be a pal, will you?

19:02.975 --> 19:06.775
- We really have to go.
- Didn't he- Didn't he bring his bike?

19:06.845 --> 19:10.212
No, he wanted to
ride in the truck. Oh.

19:10.282 --> 19:14.184
Who's going to help me unpack?
Huh?

19:15.754 --> 19:17.915
Uh, well, that's okay then.
I'll just, uh-

19:17.990 --> 19:20.220
I'll call Connie. She'll
come pick me up. No, no, no.

19:20.292 --> 19:23.659
We-We don't have to do that.
I mean, I can take you back.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.297
I'll take him back.

19:35.541 --> 19:39.500
<i>- Why are we lying to Connie?
- What do you mean?</i>

19:39.578 --> 19:41.773
You told her we were
gonna run errands.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.214
There are some things
Connie wouldn't understand.

19:46.218 --> 19:48.209
There are a lot of things
she doesn't understand.

19:48.287 --> 19:52.417
<i>Look, she's going through some hard times
right now, okay? The '60s were a very tough-</i>

19:55.661 --> 19:59.222
The world is going through
a lot of changes right now.

19:59.298 --> 20:03.064
<i>Times are changing,
especially for women.</i>

20:03.135 --> 20:06.298
Don't tell me she's got you reading
articles on that stuff now.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.499
No, this is something I heard
on the TV.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.976
You know, they were saying that
people need to communicate.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.536
You know? They need to
keep talking to each other.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.674
<i>That's what they were saying.
Look at me.</i>

20:18.750 --> 20:21.116
I'm listening to you like you were
a marriage counselor.

20:21.186 --> 20:25.384
- I gotta be crazy here.
- Look, you and Connie love each other, right?

20:25.457 --> 20:27.982
<i>- You've always loved each other.
- Hey, don't lecture me.!</i>

20:28.060 --> 20:31.154
You save it for Connie. She's the one
who's having trouble communicating.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.495
- No, she isn't.
- There are certain things a man needs, Jimmy.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.500
You wouldn't understand.

20:38.370 --> 20:41.999
- Yes, I would.
- Give it a rest, okay?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.941
Can't you at least try and understand
what she's going through?

20:45.010 --> 20:47.535
I don't want to talk about it
anymore, all right?

20:49.348 --> 20:51.339
You're running away, Frank.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.283
<i>You're running away
from your wife who loves you.</i>

20:54.353 --> 20:57.516
<i>Enough, already.
Give it a rest.</i>

21:04.296 --> 21:06.423
Home, sweet home.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.903
Frank, come on inside.

21:12.971 --> 21:17.271
I'm going for a ride. I need to be alone
for a little while, all right? Frank-

21:26.618 --> 21:31.282
Hi.
Jimmy, I didn't hear you come in.

21:31.356 --> 21:34.621
You know, these'll work better
if you leave the foil on, I think.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.627
See, it-

21:36.695 --> 21:40.563
Yeah, during the last 10 minutes of
heating, tear off the foil covering.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.623
You know, for best results.

21:42.701 --> 21:48.139
Gosh, it's getting hard to tell the
teacher from the student, huh? Yeah.

21:48.206 --> 21:51.300
How come, uh,
we only got three?

21:51.376 --> 21:53.810
Corey's staying at a friend's.
Which one?

21:53.879 --> 21:55.938
Um, Timmy.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.175
No, uh, Johnny.
Johnny Tisdale.

22:02.421 --> 22:06.084
Look, Connie, we have to talk.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.218
Sure, we can talk.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.228
Did you see that book I put
on your night table?

22:11.296 --> 22:14.265
It's a wonderful story about
the Arabian nights. No. No.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.564
Not about fairy tales.
We have to talk about you and Frank.

22:17.636 --> 22:22.869
Jimmy, that's the last thing
that you should be worried about.

22:31.116 --> 22:34.916
Frank needs you, Connie. He needs you
now more than ever, and so does Corey.

22:34.986 --> 22:38.513
Jimmy, did Frank put
you up to this? No.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.582
It's just that if you don't do
something fast, you're gonna lose him.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.651
Listen to me, Jimmy.

22:43.729 --> 22:46.357
Frank has a lot
of growing up to do.

22:46.431 --> 22:49.195
He's jealous because
I pay attention to you.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.861
Couldn't you pay attention
to him too? It's never enough.

22:51.937 --> 22:55.703
This is your time, Jimmy. I'm not
gonna let his ego get in your way!

22:55.774 --> 22:58.140
I just want the two of you
to be happy, that's all.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.178
It's too late.
No, it isn't!

23:00.245 --> 23:02.236
No?
No.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.908
Then why don't you tell me
where you went this morning?

23:06.318 --> 23:08.582
Connie-

23:15.994 --> 23:20.788
Who are you?

23:33.779 --> 23:36.247
How can this be happening?

23:38.650 --> 23:41.278
This is incredible!

23:41.353 --> 23:44.652
You mean that the whole time
that you've been-

23:44.723 --> 23:47.157
Who are you?

23:47.225 --> 23:50.524
I mean, what's your name?

23:50.595 --> 23:53.257
Alia.
Alia.

23:53.331 --> 23:56.698
Mm-hmm.
Ali-

23:56.768 --> 24:00.363
Uh, I'm Sam.
Uh, Sam.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.034
Uh, Sam Beckett.
Sam Beckett.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.873
Where are you from? I mean,

24:06.945 --> 24:09.311
Where did you come from?

24:09.381 --> 24:12.145
The future.
Where?

24:12.217 --> 24:14.947
I mean, when?

24:17.022 --> 24:20.788
Well, it's-
Well, well, well, well, well!

24:20.859 --> 24:25.796
So where did this studly morsel come from? Not
- Not now.

24:25.864 --> 24:29.664
Not now? I just want to know where you're
from. She's talking to me, sweet cheeks.

24:29.734 --> 24:32.066
I don't mind a little
afternoon's delight,

24:32.137 --> 24:36.369
as long as you don't, uh,
forget your assignment.

24:36.441 --> 24:39.239
- Where's Jimmy?
- He's Jimmy.

24:41.279 --> 24:44.510
He used to be. Excuse me.
Excuse me for a second.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.416
Are-Are you talking
to a hologram?

24:47.486 --> 24:52.924
You're talking to a hologram, aren't
you? You are a time traveler too!

24:52.991 --> 24:55.755
"Too"?
What does he mean, "too"?

24:55.827 --> 25:00.924
Sam Beckett,
I'd like you to meet my partner, Zoey.

25:00.999 --> 25:05.436
<i>Zoey. Hiya, Zoey. It's really nice to meet
you, I think. Alia, what's going on here?</i>

25:05.504 --> 25:07.631
Uh, we're not sure.

25:07.706 --> 25:09.936
Sam and I touched,
and then suddenly, he-

25:10.008 --> 25:13.705
<i>Listen to me. Listen, you mustn't say
anything to him about us. Nothing. Do you hear?</i>

25:13.778 --> 25:15.769
What did she say? Well, hey
- Why?

25:15.847 --> 25:18.748
Why? Because we don't know
anything about him!

25:18.817 --> 25:21.547
I have to go back
and run this by Lothos.

25:21.620 --> 25:26.114
Remember, keep your mouth shut.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.786
She's gone.
Oh.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.193
Do you have anyone helping you?

25:32.264 --> 25:37.065
- Well, um,
it's funny you should ask that.

25:37.135 --> 25:40.627
Sam, I've been getting all kinds
of mixed data from Ziggy, and-

25:40.705 --> 25:43.765
- Oh, hello.
- Alia.

25:43.842 --> 25:47.801
Uh-huh?
This is-This is Al.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.712
<i>Alia.
Hello, Al.</i>

25:50.782 --> 25:53.751
The pleasure
- What the hell's going on here? Who's this?

25:53.818 --> 25:56.048
You're not going to believe this,
okay? But Alia-

25:56.121 --> 25:58.589
Alia is-
Yeah. Alia, yeah. Is who?

25:58.657 --> 26:01.125
- Are you ready for this?
- Who is it?

26:01.192 --> 26:03.990
Alia is a time traveler!

26:04.062 --> 26:07.554
Yeah, okay.
Where's Connie? No.

26:07.632 --> 26:10.795
Alia is Connie.

26:14.005 --> 26:16.633
You're right.
I don't believe this!

26:16.708 --> 26:20.474
I don't know how it happened,
Al, but it- it did.

26:20.545 --> 26:24.379
- You mean, she can see you instead ofJimmy?
- Yeah. Isn't it great?

26:24.449 --> 26:27.680
<i>Oh, that's terrific. Does Al
have any idea what happened?</i>

26:27.752 --> 26:32.655
Um- Um, well, uh- Ziggy is just as
shocked as you are about all of this.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.783
He's finding out.
The best she can figure...

26:34.859 --> 26:39.455
is that when the two of you touched, it set up
some kind of magnetic convergence or something-

26:39.531 --> 26:42.762
He says that
- so that you could see each other for who you really are.

26:42.834 --> 26:45.769
He says that something
happened when we touched. Uh-

26:45.837 --> 26:49.170
Oh, I know.
I felt it too.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.368
<i>No wonder I've been getting
weird data from Ziggy.</i>

26:52.444 --> 26:54.503
She's been sensing her.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.911
I got a bad feeling about this, Sam.
Um-

26:56.982 --> 26:59.712
Ziggy has no record
of any other time traveler.

26:59.784 --> 27:04.448
You know what, Al? I think you should go
back and see if you can give her a hand.

27:04.522 --> 27:07.889
- Are you all right?
- I never been better.

27:07.959 --> 27:11.588
- "Never been better. " Well,
I'm gonna go see Ziggy- - Okay.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.155
And help find out who the hell
this is and where she came from.

27:15.233 --> 27:19.533
<i>In the meantime, you promise me
that you won't forget why you're here.</i>

27:19.604 --> 27:22.801
- You too.
- Me too. Okay.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.865
Oh, brother.

27:24.943 --> 27:27.741
Bye-bye. He's, uh-

27:27.812 --> 27:30.303
He's gone.
Oh.

27:30.382 --> 27:34.751
So, then I, uh- I stepped into this
accelerator, which is what we call it, and-

27:34.819 --> 27:37.310
And you've been leaping
ever since? Yeah. Yeah.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.755
What about you?
Um-

27:39.824 --> 27:42.691
Where are you from?
How did you get here?

27:42.761 --> 27:45.059
Well, it's kind of hard to say.

27:45.130 --> 27:50.227
I mean, I was part of an experiment, but to tell
you the truth, the details are all kind of foggy.

27:50.301 --> 27:52.701
I mean, I can't exactly remember.
It's almost as if-

27:52.771 --> 27:55.001
Is it like your memory
was Swiss-cheesed?

27:55.073 --> 27:57.041
Exactly.

27:57.108 --> 28:00.544
I mean, I don't have any control
over where I go or who I become.

28:00.612 --> 28:04.446
It's kind of scary sometimes.
Tell me about it.

28:07.552 --> 28:11.852
Do you realize
how incredible this is?

28:11.923 --> 28:17.555
I mean that- I mean, not only do I come
back here again, but- but I meet you, and-

28:17.629 --> 28:19.620
What do you mean,
"come back here again"?

28:19.698 --> 28:23.964
I've been here before.
I've- I've been Jimmy.

28:24.035 --> 28:27.869
- When?
- I'm really not sure.

28:27.939 --> 28:32.239
<i>From the looks of things, it couldn't
have been more than a couple years ago.</i>

28:32.310 --> 28:35.143
See, I gotJimmy his job on the dock.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.478
- I saved Corey from drowning.
- Have you helped a lot of people?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.848
Yeah. Yeah, see,
that's- that's how I leap.

28:40.919 --> 28:44.650
L- I fix things that went wrong.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.352
How does it work for you?
Oh, each assignment is different.

28:48.426 --> 28:52.055
What's your assignment this time?
I came back for you.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.224
I mean, Jimmy. To help him
become more independent.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.530
What about you?

28:57.602 --> 29:01.003
I came back for Frank
and Connie's marriage.

29:01.072 --> 29:06.339
See, in their real history, Frank makes
a bad decision, and the marriage is ruined.

29:06.411 --> 29:10.643
That can't be right. According to Lothos,
everything works out perfectly for them. Lothos?

29:10.715 --> 29:14.776
He's the artificial intelligence unit
that controls my assignments.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.844
You must have a similar unit.
Ziggy.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.515
That's what we call her. Are you
sure your data's up to date? Oh.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.391
<i>Positive. Zoey would have told me
if something was wrong.</i>

29:23.461 --> 29:25.827
Besides, Lothos is very efficient.

29:25.897 --> 29:30.857
He doesn't make mistakes.
Yeah, well, there's always a first time.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.926
What are you talking about?
Is that Al?

29:33.004 --> 29:36.599
- Yeah.
- On the way back from the chamber, I popped into Shirley's apartment.

29:36.674 --> 29:39.768
Frank is there, and it looks like
he's gonna fall off the fidelity wagon.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.971
Oh, no.
What's wrong?

29:42.046 --> 29:44.037
Frank went back
to Shirley's apartment.

29:44.115 --> 29:47.710
- Yeah, so you better get over there before it's too late.
- I gotta go.

29:47.786 --> 29:52.780
No, you can't. I mean, there's just
so many things that I need to ask you.

29:52.857 --> 29:55.485
There's so many things
that I want to tell you.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.892
I told you everything's
gonna work out fine for them.

29:57.962 --> 30:01.625
No, there's a 97.6% chance
that this is it.

30:01.699 --> 30:03.724
I have to make sure myself.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.793
Well, then I'll go with you.
No.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.804
No, Frank sees you as Connie.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.840
Look, I'll be back.
I promise.

30:09.908 --> 30:12.001
Come on.
You don't have much time.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.977
Just wait right here, okay?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.649
<i>As much as I hated to leave Alia,</i>

30:20.718 --> 30:23.346
<i>I knew that if I didn't stop Frank,
I was putting Jimmy in danger,</i>

30:23.421 --> 30:26.413
<i>and that was something
I wasn't prepared to do.</i>

30:27.792 --> 30:29.783
Please don't let me be late.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.232
Jimmy, w-what are you doing here?

30:35.300 --> 30:37.427
I need to talk to my brother.

30:37.502 --> 30:41.063
L- Is something wrong?
No. I just need to talk to Frank, okay?

30:41.139 --> 30:45.599
He's not here.
Then what's his truck doing out front?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.145
L- I don't-
Frank.

30:49.147 --> 30:53.106
L- I tried to explain, but- It's all
right. It's all right. I'll take care of it.

30:53.184 --> 30:57.382
Jimmy, you shouldn't have come here.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

30:57.455 --> 31:00.083
Go home, all right?

31:00.158 --> 31:02.752
No, I'm not going home
without you.

31:02.827 --> 31:05.352
There's nothing there for me
anymore, Jimmy.

31:05.430 --> 31:08.365
Nothing? How can you say that?
What about your wife and your son?

31:08.433 --> 31:11.300
What about me? This has
nothing to do with Corey or you.

31:11.369 --> 31:15.965
Look, just get on your bike
and go home. Please?

31:16.040 --> 31:19.476
Don't do this, okay?

31:19.544 --> 31:22.911
I know you think that Connie doesn't
care anymore, but you're wrong about that.

31:22.981 --> 31:27.884
She does care. She loves you,
and I think you love her too.

31:27.952 --> 31:30.921
Don't throw it all away.

31:30.989 --> 31:32.980
You may never find it again.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.817
Please, just come home
with me now.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.489
You don't understand, Jimmy.

31:51.042 --> 31:54.671
<i>I couldn't get through to him, Alia,
no matter what I said.</i>

31:54.746 --> 31:58.341
It's not too late. Maybe there's
something you can still do to help.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.908
L- I just don't understand
why I haven't leaped.

32:01.986 --> 32:05.387
I mean, at least if I got out of here,
you could continue working with Jimmy,

32:05.456 --> 32:07.890
and maybe prevent him
from being sent away.

32:07.959 --> 32:12.862
Do you always think of other
people first? What do you mean?

32:14.899 --> 32:18.699
I mean, maybe there's another
reason that you are still here.

32:20.471 --> 32:22.666
What-What are you
talking about?

32:24.776 --> 32:26.869
You and me, Sam.

32:36.187 --> 32:41.420
I mean, you're really the only person I've ever
met that can understand the longing that I've felt.

32:41.492 --> 32:44.154
The emptiness.

32:44.228 --> 32:47.356
The hunger for something.
Anything.

32:47.432 --> 32:50.162
Something familiar.

32:50.234 --> 32:54.864
A touch, a smell, a taste.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.931
Don't you see that-

32:58.009 --> 33:02.105
Sam, I'm not Connie,

33:02.180 --> 33:04.341
and you're notJimmy.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.780
Mmm.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.467
Mmm.

33:24.535 --> 33:28.733
But I am Jimmy.

33:28.806 --> 33:31.468
I mean, at least a part of me
is Jimmy.

33:31.542 --> 33:34.306
I know who you are,
and I want you.

33:34.379 --> 33:36.939
Mmm. Make love to me, Sam.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.306
This isn't right.
Why?

34:12.382 --> 34:15.681
Why? Because- I don't-

34:15.753 --> 34:20.656
I don't know. It just feels-
Sam- Sam, we deserve this.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.993
Tell me that you don't want me,
and I'll stop.

34:30.635 --> 34:32.626
<i>Connie?</i>

34:34.038 --> 34:36.666
<i>Jimmy?
Oh, no. Oh, no. Frank.</i>

34:36.741 --> 34:40.438
<i>Where is everybody? Here, get
dressed. Hurry. All right. Um-</i>

34:40.511 --> 34:42.877
<i>Hello?
Oh, my God.</i>

34:42.947 --> 34:45.141
<i>If he finds us like this, he'll leave Connie for sure
- Corey?</i>

34:45.216 --> 34:47.206
<i>Right after he strangles me.
Jimmy.!</i>

34:47.284 --> 34:50.583
Okay, we'll tell him that we
were talking, right? You decided-

34:50.655 --> 34:54.751
<i>Connie.! What are
you doing? Get your-</i>

34:57.128 --> 34:59.688
What are you-

35:07.205 --> 35:10.936
Frank!

35:14.045 --> 35:17.503
Frank!

35:17.582 --> 35:20.210
Frank!
Alia-

35:20.284 --> 35:22.718
Frank, help me!
Listen to me, Frank-

35:22.787 --> 35:24.948
Oh, my God. What
happened? Frank-

35:25.022 --> 35:28.185
It was Jimmy.
He tried to rape me.

35:28.259 --> 35:30.193
What?
That's a lie, Frank.

35:30.261 --> 35:32.661
That's a lie!
Get away from me!

35:32.730 --> 35:36.564
I tried to stop him,
but he was too strong for me.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.228
He tried to-
I- I thought he was going-

35:39.303 --> 35:43.603
I thought he was going to k-kill me.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.801
No, Frank.
You attacked my wife?

35:45.877 --> 35:47.811
No.
My wife?

35:47.879 --> 35:49.710
No, I didn't.
I took you into my house!

35:49.780 --> 35:51.805
I took care of you!
I didn't, Frank!

35:51.883 --> 35:54.317
- Don't lie to me! Don't lie to me!
- Sam, don't hit him!

35:54.385 --> 35:57.320
- Don't hit him!
He doesn't know what he's doing!

35:57.388 --> 35:59.413
Everything! Everything!
I didn't do it!

35:59.490 --> 36:01.424
No, you look!
Look at her!

36:01.492 --> 36:03.551
Look at her!
Did she do that to herself?

36:03.628 --> 36:05.653
Sam, he won't listen to you!
Just get away from him!

36:07.532 --> 36:10.968
Now, you listen to me.

36:11.035 --> 36:14.095
I'm notJimmy. Okay?

36:14.172 --> 36:17.835
And this-
this is not Connie!

36:19.443 --> 36:23.106
What?
What did you say?

36:24.582 --> 36:28.382
<i>- She's not your wife.
- This ain't happening.</i>

36:28.452 --> 36:31.888
This is insane.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.948
Keeping you here was supposed
to make a difference.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.120
It was supposed to be a good thing. I'm
telling you the truth, Frank. Please-

36:38.196 --> 36:42.189
No, you stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! No! No!

36:42.266 --> 36:46.259
I won't let you lie to me, Jimmy! I won't
let you lie to me, Jimmy! Frank, stop it!

36:46.337 --> 36:51.274
Stop it! Stop it! It wasn't his
fault! Just please call Dr. Smithfield!

36:51.342 --> 36:54.311
How can you defend him
after what he did to you?

36:54.378 --> 36:57.211
He's your brother.
Please, Frank, just call Dr. Smithfield.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.715
<i>Please.! Please.!</i>

37:11.229 --> 37:14.494
Sam, what the hell happened here?

37:16.033 --> 37:18.399
I don't know.

37:18.469 --> 37:21.836
We were in the bedroom,
she started to scream,

37:21.906 --> 37:24.636
and- and-

37:24.709 --> 37:28.236
Then Frank came home, and-
I don't know.

37:28.312 --> 37:31.611
I knew this was wrong
from the very beginning.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.617
She said she was here to helpJimmy.
Yeah, sure she's gonna help him.

37:34.685 --> 37:38.314
<i>She's gonna help him get put away.</i>

37:38.389 --> 37:41.222
I helped her.
How could I be so stupid?

37:41.292 --> 37:44.591
Things are still changing here. It
doesn't look good for anybody though.

37:44.662 --> 37:47.654
But you-you've got to
get out of here and stop her.

37:49.967 --> 37:52.663
<i>- You have to go and get him, Frank.
- How could I have missed this?</i>

37:52.737 --> 37:54.898
How could this happen?
I don't understand.

37:54.972 --> 37:57.372
I didn't want to say anything before,
but this-

37:57.441 --> 38:00.433
this isn't the first time
thatJimmy's tried something like this.

38:00.511 --> 38:04.106
What?
Why didn't you tell me?

38:04.181 --> 38:06.445
I was afraid.

38:06.517 --> 38:09.782
I thought that if I could just
get him out on his own and-

38:09.854 --> 38:12.379
and that he'd be okay and that-
that you wouldn't have to know.

38:12.456 --> 38:16.290
This doesn't make any sense.
None of this makes any sense to me.

38:16.360 --> 38:20.057
Frank, you have to go get Dr.
Smithfield. He has to talk toJimmy now.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.361
He has to see him like this.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.526
This is my fault, Connie.

38:24.602 --> 38:28.003
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.</i>

38:28.072 --> 38:30.836
<i>"I'm so sorry. "</i>

38:30.908 --> 38:33.138
- How pathetic.
- Frank, listen to me.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.872
You have to go get Dr. Smithfield
and bring him here.

38:35.946 --> 38:37.971
All right.
I'll call him again.

38:38.049 --> 38:41.576
<i>No. You have to go and get him
and bring him back here.</i>

38:41.652 --> 38:44.143
I'm not gonna leave you here
alone. Would you get rid of him...

38:44.221 --> 38:47.315
<i>so we can get on with this? L
- I can't go out like this, Frank.</i>

38:47.391 --> 38:49.325
I need to take a shower
or something.

38:49.393 --> 38:51.691
I'm not going to leave you
here alone. I'm all right.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.788
He's locked in our room.
He-He-He can't hurt me.

38:54.865 --> 38:57.663
Not anymore.
Please, Frank, go.

38:57.735 --> 39:00.727
Hurry. Please go.

39:03.674 --> 39:08.702
If he touches you again,
I'll kill him.

39:16.387 --> 39:18.855
Bravo! Brava!

39:18.923 --> 39:21.323
"He can't hurt me.
Not anymore. "

39:21.392 --> 39:23.690
You were exquisite.
Why haven't I leaped?

39:23.761 --> 39:26.423
Why am I still here?

39:26.497 --> 39:29.557
Lothos has decided you've got
one more thing to do before you go.

39:29.633 --> 39:32.363
A little bonus.
What kind of a bonus?

39:32.436 --> 39:34.529
Seems you're to kill
the good Dr. Beckett.

39:34.605 --> 39:36.630
Why? He hasn't tried to stop us.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.369
Alia, my pet, do I detect
a tinge of pity in your voice?

39:39.443 --> 39:43.641
I just want it over, that's all.
Then kill him and be done with it.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.478
Lothos has done a scan.

39:46.550 --> 39:50.281
There's a. 38 caliber pistol
in the top of the front hall closet.

39:51.422 --> 39:53.390
This could be the one
that gets you home.

39:53.457 --> 39:56.324
Home, Alia!

39:57.962 --> 40:01.955
I think I'll go and check
on Mr. Wonderful.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.102
Oh, what a waste.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.968
What an absolutely delicious waste.

40:09.039 --> 40:11.132
<i>Hurry up. Frank is on the way
to getJimmy's doctor,</i>

40:11.208 --> 40:13.142
<i>and they're gonna
put him in the asylum.</i>

40:13.210 --> 40:16.179
Where's Alia? Don't worry
about her. She's coming.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.648
Hurry up, darling.
He's asking for you.

40:19.717 --> 40:21.651
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh," what?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.744
History's changing again.
Uh-

40:23.821 --> 40:28.087
According to tomorrow's paper,
Connie is arraigned for killing Jimmy.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.617
The police report said that
she shot him in self-defense.

40:31.695 --> 40:33.629
<i>Get away from the door, Sam.</i>

40:33.697 --> 40:36.393
<i>I'm coming in, and I've got a gun.</i>

40:37.735 --> 40:41.227
Surprise!

40:41.305 --> 40:44.763
Uh-oh.
Do something.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.969
Not until I know why
she's doing this.

40:47.044 --> 40:51.140
- Is Al here?
- You bet your sweet ass I am, sweetheart.

40:51.215 --> 40:55.015
Yeah, he's here.
He says you're gonna shootJimmy.

40:55.085 --> 40:57.781
<i>Why?
I've got my orders.</i>

40:57.855 --> 41:01.723
- Where have I heard that one before?
- So you were never here to helpJimmy.

41:01.792 --> 41:05.159
You gotta stop her, because she's gonna
destroy you and Jimmy and the whole family.

41:05.229 --> 41:08.164
- Where do you come from?
- What difference does it make?

41:08.232 --> 41:10.166
You lost and I won.

41:10.234 --> 41:13.863
- So you're going to shoot me?
- You're not the first person I've killed, Sam.

41:13.938 --> 41:16.873
- Get on with it.
- Why are you doing this?

41:16.941 --> 41:20.399
- Because she's evil.
- Evil?

41:20.478 --> 41:23.538
Now, there's a novel concept.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.913
Sam, she's your counterpart. You're good,
and she's evil. That's what she does.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.145
No, I don't believe
that there's some force...

41:29.220 --> 41:32.519
leaping her around, ruining people's
lives for the pleasure of it.

41:32.590 --> 41:35.184
How deliciously naive.

41:35.259 --> 41:39.161
- Then you're a fool.
- Sam, I'm telling you, she's evil!

41:39.230 --> 41:41.858
Destroy people's lives? That's
what you do? I don't believe that!

41:41.932 --> 41:43.866
The perfect hero.

41:43.934 --> 41:46.164
Death in his face,
and he wants to deny its power.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.171
And you're telling me that God
or time or-

41:48.239 --> 41:51.003
or whatever has put us here
against each other?

41:51.075 --> 41:53.407
Not God.

41:55.746 --> 41:57.737
You can't kill me.

41:59.049 --> 42:02.883
You'd be killing yourself, Alia.

42:02.953 --> 42:08.220
<i>I mean, think about it. I only exist
because you do, and you because of me.</i>

42:08.292 --> 42:11.386
If I die, it only makes sense
that you would too.

42:11.462 --> 42:15.956
He's stalling. Shoot him.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.126
What if he's telling the truth?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.762
What if I kill him, and then I kill myself,
and then I can't go home?

42:20.838 --> 42:25.172
- You're getting to her, Sam.
- Evil only exists because of good.

42:26.443 --> 42:30.209
<i>If you kill me, we cancel
each other out. Do it.</i>

42:30.281 --> 42:33.375
- Kill him, damn it!
- Go on. Keep after her, Sam.

42:33.450 --> 42:35.816
You can't kill me, Alia.

42:35.886 --> 42:40.585
Because I know that somewhere inside of you,
there's a woman who feels the same things I do.

42:40.658 --> 42:44.094
The same loneliness, the same fear. I felt
it the first time we touched. You felt it too.

42:44.161 --> 42:47.790
This could be your ticket home.
This could be the way out.

42:47.865 --> 42:50.834
- If I kill you, then I can go home?
- No. No, not that way.

42:50.901 --> 42:53.893
Killing me will only add to his power
or her power. Whatever.

42:53.971 --> 42:56.462
<i>You have the power, Alia.</i>

42:56.540 --> 42:58.974
<i>You can choose not to kill me.</i>

42:59.043 --> 43:02.479
He doesn't know what
he's talking about!

43:02.546 --> 43:07.506
Lothos could send you back to your
worst nightmare if you don't pull that trigger.

43:07.585 --> 43:12.420
<i>- There's got to be an end.
- Alia, we clawed our way...</i>

43:12.489 --> 43:17.085
<i>out of hell to land simple assignments like
home wrecking and adultery. Don't listen to her.!</i>

43:17.161 --> 43:20.494
<i>- You don't want to go back to the horror we've lived through before.!
- Listen to me.!</i>

43:20.564 --> 43:22.589
No, I can't kill all those people again.

43:22.666 --> 43:24.759
Then pull the trigger!

43:24.835 --> 43:28.032
You're not evil, Alia.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.266
Whatever trapped you in time is.

43:30.341 --> 43:32.673
Pull the bloody trigger!

43:35.045 --> 43:37.036
<i>Do it, Alia.!</i>

43:40.751 --> 43:43.447
No. No, I can't.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.887
<i>You stupid fool.!</i>

43:51.428 --> 43:53.419
What have you done?

43:53.497 --> 43:55.965
I swear we'll find you!

44:10.714 --> 44:14.047
Come on, Jimbo.
Corey's gonna be late for school.

44:17.821 --> 44:20.255
What's the matter?

44:20.324 --> 44:22.884
Where's Connie, Frank?

44:22.960 --> 44:25.952
She's still at her sister's.

44:26.030 --> 44:28.794
You okay, Jimbo?

44:28.866 --> 44:31.460
Yeah, I'm fine.

44:31.535 --> 44:33.594
Good. All right.
Shake a leg then.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.662
Truck pulls out in five minutes.

44:38.642 --> 44:41.975
What's going on here, Al?
Wha-

44:42.046 --> 44:44.606
Huh? What's going on?

44:44.682 --> 44:47.947
I don't know.
Somehow we-we've lost two days.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.009
Are you telling me
none of this never happened?

44:50.087 --> 44:53.056
No, I'm not.
Ziggy is telling both of us.

44:53.123 --> 44:55.591
Where's Alia?
Uh-

44:58.062 --> 45:00.053
She's gone.

45:05.002 --> 45:06.993
She's not gone, Al.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.572
Alia is not gone.

45:38.335 --> 45:40.269
Oh, boy.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
