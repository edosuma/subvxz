00:03.671 --> 00:05.798
- Hi, guys.

00:03.671 --> 00:05.798
- Hey, Steph.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.300
Hey, I finished my

00:05.840 --> 00:08.300
project for sewing class.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.844
I designed it myself.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.263
Well, how does it look?

00:15.557 --> 00:17.267
Like you designed it yourself.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.187
Don't hold back, Michelle.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.189
Okay. It's ugly too.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.318
Steph, I think that

00:23.983 --> 00:26.318
your blouse is beautiful.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.570
- You do?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.570
- You<i> do?</i>

00:30.906 --> 00:32.783
Absolutely.

00:32.825 --> 00:36.411
Ah! Well, I'm glad someone

00:32.825 --> 00:36.411
around here has taste.

00:40.081 --> 00:44.419
Aunt Becky, you actually thought

00:40.081 --> 00:44.419
that blouse was beautiful?

00:44.461 --> 00:48.131
Well, no. But I didn't

00:44.461 --> 00:48.131
wanna hurt her feelings.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.550
So you lied?

00:49.591 --> 00:50.801
No!

00:53.220 --> 00:55.848
I bent the truth.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.391
Exaggerated a bit.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.643
Put a pleasant spin on things.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.076
sloppy joes, daddy?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.453
Well, you just keep your eye

01:57.117 --> 01:59.453
on Uncle Joey at dinner.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.873
- Hey.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.165
Guess who we got to referee

02:04.207 --> 02:06.418
our school fundraiser

02:04.207 --> 02:06.418
basketball game?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.753
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.004
- No way.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.004
- Wow.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.005
Good. You got all three of them.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.548
That's nice.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.887
Jess, y-you don't know

02:14.802 --> 02:16.887
much about sports, do you?

02:16.929 --> 02:19.180
It just so happens

02:16.929 --> 02:19.180
that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar--

02:19.222 --> 02:20.766
And that's one person.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.684
Yeah, he, he's

02:20.808 --> 02:22.684
one of the greatest

02:22.726 --> 02:24.019
basketball players ever.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.353
Yeah, and since

02:24.061 --> 02:25.353
we thought of this

02:25.395 --> 02:27.564
Kimmy and I get to coach

02:25.395 --> 02:27.564
the celebrity teams.

02:27.606 --> 02:30.484
Yeah. I'm coachin' the Happy

02:27.606 --> 02:30.484
News team from Channel 43.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.611
And we're gonna

02:30.525 --> 02:32.611
kill your team.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.237
I don't even

02:32.653 --> 02:34.237
have a team yet.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.782
Hmm. This is gonna be

02:34.279 --> 02:36.782
easier than I thought.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.034
See ya, squirts.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.787
And, uh, since the game

02:39.076 --> 02:41.787
is three-on-three

02:41.829 --> 02:44.205
all I need are three

02:41.829 --> 02:44.205
local media personalities.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.792
Say, a couple of DJs

02:44.247 --> 02:46.792
and a talk show host.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.960
- I'm in.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.878
- I'm outta here.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.878
- Jess!

02:49.920 --> 02:53.132
Come on. Basketball's

02:49.920 --> 02:53.132
a national pastime.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.800
No, that's baseball.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.677
Uh, it's-it's

02:54.842 --> 02:56.677
a sport of kings.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.720
No, that's horse racing.

Where America shops. Sears.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.852
Let's try a new road.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.395
Uncle Jesse, you'd be

03:04.893 --> 03:07.395
doing it for a good cause.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.356
Yeah, when you

03:07.437 --> 03:09.356
think of it, Jess..

03:09.397 --> 03:11.190
...it is a great way

03:09.397 --> 03:11.190
to get all sweaty

03:11.232 --> 03:13.485
before your

03:11.232 --> 03:13.485
Saturday night bath.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.365
Guys, just

03:16.446 --> 03:18.365
forget it, alright?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.826
Sports, sports intimidate me.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.826
I've never been good at sports.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.327
I remember the names they

03:20.868 --> 03:22.327
used to call me as a kid.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.204
Uh-uh, fumble-fingers,

03:25.246 --> 03:26.456
Oh, kids can be so cruel.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.671
No, no, no, my

03:30.544 --> 03:32.671
policy's always been

03:32.713 --> 03:34.756
just say no to sports,

03:32.713 --> 03:34.756
okay? I can't do it.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.092
I just, I-I just,

03:34.798 --> 03:37.092
I just can't do it.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.469
You can do anything.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.934

Alright then, this Saturday,

04:00.908 --> 04:04.494

04:04.536 --> 04:06.872
and I'll meet you right out

04:04.536 --> 04:06.872
there in that basketball field.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.722

04:26.391 --> 04:27.809
Hey, Aunt Becky.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.728
I have a surprise for you.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.397
Since you love the blouse

04:29.770 --> 04:32.397
I made at school so much

04:32.439 --> 04:34.524
I'm giving it to you.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.447
Thanks, Steph.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.952
You can wear it to

04:42.199 --> 04:44.952
the celebrity basketball game.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.494
Oh, great.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.291
I'll definitely

04:47.955 --> 04:51.291
stand out in the crowd.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.418
You'd stand out in the circus.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.890
This basketball

05:04.512 --> 05:06.890
thing's a piece of cake.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.350
Daddy, this is our basket.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.352
That one's yours.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.856
Right up there?

05:18.152 --> 05:19.694
Nice outfit, Jess.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.405
What are you tryin' out for,

05:19.736 --> 05:22.405

05:22.447 --> 05:24.866
Well...I got my wristband.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.953
Alright, now you look

05:26.160 --> 05:27.953
like a real athlete.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.496
Uh, why don't we

05:27.995 --> 05:29.496
work on some passing?

05:29.537 --> 05:30.914
- Okay.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.914
- Let's do some passing.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.499
I'll pass you the ball,

05:30.956 --> 05:32.499
you go under the basket.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.126
- Where do I stand?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.126
- Right there under that net.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.086
- Let's do some passing, fellas.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.086
- Okay.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.880
Alright, show me the ball,

05:36.128 --> 05:38.880
big boy. Come on.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.715
[grunts]

05:40.757 --> 05:43.468
Jess, you're-you're

05:40.757 --> 05:43.468
supposed to use your hands.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.971
- Oh, I will.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.971
- Alright, okay. Time out.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.473
Time out. You're both at fault.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.226
Jess, you should've caught it

05:48.515 --> 05:51.226
and, Danny, you should know that

05:51.268 --> 05:53.436
he can't catch.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.648
Alright, I'm sorry. Let's just

05:53.478 --> 05:56.648
start with a simple layup drill.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.483
Okay. Like, two questions.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.818
A, what's a simple layup?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.196
And two, does

05:59.860 --> 06:02.196
the drilling part hurt?

06:04.739 --> 06:07.951
Jess, the layup is the most

06:04.739 --> 06:07.951
basic shot in basketball.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.619
It's very simple,

06:07.993 --> 06:09.619
all you do is just

06:09.661 --> 06:11.663
dribble down the lane

06:09.661 --> 06:11.663
and as you approach the basket

06:11.705 --> 06:13.832
if you're on the left side, you

06:11.705 --> 06:13.832
push off with your right foot

06:13.874 --> 06:15.416
if you're on the right side

06:13.874 --> 06:15.416
you push off with your left foot

06:15.458 --> 06:17.002
then you just shoot

06:15.458 --> 06:17.002
the ball directly

06:17.044 --> 06:18.295
at the backboard

06:17.044 --> 06:18.295
at the correct angle

06:18.337 --> 06:19.671
to bank it

06:18.337 --> 06:19.671
through the hoop.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.840
That, my friend,

06:19.713 --> 06:21.840
is a simple layup.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.386
What's a really

06:24.551 --> 06:27.386
simple layup?

06:27.428 --> 06:29.306
Watch and learn.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.306
Danny, give me the ball.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.432
Here you go.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.432
Come here, you'll be safe.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.561
Watch, Jess. Okay.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.561
Here you go. Simple layup.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.897
Dribble, dribble, dribble..

06:38.065 --> 06:40.317
- Layup.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.317
- Okay.

06:40.359 --> 06:43.153
Alright. Doesn't look so tough.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.529
Do a couple of

06:43.195 --> 06:44.529
dribbles, then you

06:44.571 --> 06:46.073
and then you do

06:44.571 --> 06:46.073
a thing by the basket.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.406
Got it.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.576
Dribble, dribble..

06:50.077 --> 06:51.245
Ow!

06:56.415 --> 06:58.960
[sighs]

06:56.415 --> 06:58.960
I told you I needed that helmet.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.757
- What's with that look?

07:01.171 --> 07:03.757
- What look?

07:03.798 --> 07:07.135
- Th-th-that "he bites" look.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.135
- You know what?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.887
You should spend more

07:07.177 --> 07:08.887
time lookin' at the basket

07:08.929 --> 07:10.638
and less time

07:08.929 --> 07:10.638
lookin' at our looks.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.515
Maybe I should spend a little

07:10.680 --> 07:12.515
time lookin' for new teachers.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.101
I'd say the teachers are

07:12.557 --> 07:14.101
doin' a pretty darn good job

07:14.142 --> 07:15.852
considering the student

07:14.142 --> 07:15.852
they're working with.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.856
Oh. Yeah, right. You guys

07:15.894 --> 07:19.856
couldn't teach Comet to bark.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.067
I'll bet you we could teach

07:19.898 --> 07:22.067
Comet how to play basketball

07:22.109 --> 07:23.443
a lot better than you.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.363
[scoffs]

07:27.281 --> 07:29.449
Yeah, right.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.491
Joey, give me the ball.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.491
Would you, please?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.785
- Okay.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.785
- Thanks, man.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.288
I'd like you to just

07:31.826 --> 07:34.288
study this, Jesse.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.497
Thank you.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.497
Comet! Over here, boy.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.335
Okay, stay. Stay.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.335
Back up. Sit. Good boy.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.797
Okay, Comet, this isn't as hard

07:40.377 --> 07:43.797
as Jesse makes it look, okay?

07:43.838 --> 07:48.302
All you have to do is

07:43.838 --> 07:48.302
get ready, aim and shoot.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.263
[Danny and Joey cheering]

07:53.348 --> 07:55.600
Comet can make a basket.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.397
Well, he got lucky.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.397
He's a lucky dog.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.150
He's better than you, daddy.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.196
Wait a minute.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.196
Give me that ball.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.615
I just wanna show you guys I can

08:08.238 --> 08:10.615
make one lousy basket, alright?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.159
- 'Alright. Go.'

08:10.657 --> 08:12.159
- 'Okay.'

08:14.828 --> 08:16.037
You guys split.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.497
- You're makin' me nervous.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.497
- Alright.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.166
I'm gonna learn how to

08:17.538 --> 08:19.166
shoot basketballs, okay?

08:19.207 --> 08:21.042
If-if I have to stay here

08:19.207 --> 08:21.042
till midnight I'm gonna learn.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.586
- Good. Good.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.586
- Come on, boys. Let's go.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.213
- Come on.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.213
- 'Come on.'

08:27.007 --> 08:29.217
I can't be worse than a dog.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.263
[instrumental music]

08:33.972 --> 08:34.973
[Comet barks]

08:35.015 --> 08:36.683
At least I don't have fleas.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.316
[instrumental music]

08:51.406 --> 08:53.950
[instrumental music]

09:06.880 --> 09:09.341
Mind, mind if

09:06.880 --> 09:09.341
we use the court?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.592
No, no, not at all.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.428
You ever play any

09:11.634 --> 09:13.428
basketball before?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.930
A little.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.516
Yeah. Well, let me tell

09:15.972 --> 09:17.516
you somethin', pally.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.893
It's not as easy as it looks.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.186
But, uh, you're a tall guy

09:21.228 --> 09:23.397
it should come

09:21.228 --> 09:23.397
pretty natural to you.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.357
- Go nuts.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.357
- Thanks.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.486
Son, what shot do you

09:27.067 --> 09:29.486
wanna see me shoot first?

09:29.528 --> 09:32.655
- Um...three-pointers.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.655
- Ugh.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.700
- Um...how about skyhook?

09:32.697 --> 09:35.700
- Yes, daddy.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.452
Okay.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.703
Here, you take that.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.086
[kid cheering]

09:49.005 --> 09:51.508
Whoa. There you go.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.469
- You're a lucky guy, you know?

09:51.550 --> 09:54.469
- I've had a little practice.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.222
Son, why don't you go play now?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.806
And daddy's gonna

09:57.264 --> 09:58.806
shoot a hoop.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.225
Okay.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.102
No, I mean, uh,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.102
I mean, you're lucky

10:02.143 --> 10:04.104
'cause your kid looks

10:02.143 --> 10:04.104
up to you, you know?

10:04.145 --> 10:06.356
I mean, he looks at you

10:04.145 --> 10:06.356
like you're a real hero.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.567
Yeah, well, I raised

10:06.398 --> 10:08.567
his allowance last week.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.237
Uh, I made a total

10:09.734 --> 10:12.237
fool out of myself

10:12.279 --> 10:14.489
in front of my kids today. You

10:12.279 --> 10:14.489
know, let me tell you somethin'.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.116
I'm the worst basketball

10:14.531 --> 10:16.116
player in the world

10:16.157 --> 10:17.367
and to top it all off, I gotta

10:17.409 --> 10:18.743
play this silly

10:17.409 --> 10:18.743
tournament tomorrow.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.495
Oh, come on.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.495
You can't be that bad.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.789
Why don't you take a shot?

10:22.830 --> 10:23.915
Alright.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.172
[metal clangs]

10:31.214 --> 10:33.383
- Okay, you can be that bad.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.383
- 'Yeah.'

10:34.509 --> 10:36.553
How am I gonna face my kids?

10:36.595 --> 10:38.597
Well, maybe I can

10:36.595 --> 10:38.597
give you a few pointers.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.723
- Alright.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.723
- Let's start with the basics.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.727
- This is a ball.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.727
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.397
That is the basket.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.024
Yeah, well, the problem

10:47.439 --> 10:50.024
is getting this into that.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.615
You tryin' to hustle me?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.783
No, no, I swear.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.783
I never did that before.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.202
Yeah, right. Shoot a layup.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.455
Without a helmet?

11:09.127 --> 11:12.172
Alright. The bounce, bounce.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.052
Sorry about that hustle crack.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.638
Well, at least I didn't

11:18.094 --> 11:19.638
smack myself in the face

11:19.678 --> 11:21.139
this time with the ball.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.139
You should have seen it earlier.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.681
It went boom..

11:24.100 --> 11:26.144
- Let's try a foul shot.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.144
- Okay, yeah.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.355
Let's try a foul shot.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.774
- And-and that would be?

11:28.396 --> 11:31.774
- At the foul line.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.652
Which would be?

11:33.692 --> 11:35.028
Right there.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.405
And I stand?

11:38.490 --> 11:40.575
Behind it.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.619
- And I face?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.619
- The basket!

11:42.661 --> 11:44.245
I know. I was kidding

11:42.661 --> 11:44.245
you on that last one.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.997
A little basketball humor.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.997
Hike that thing over here.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.790
Hike that thing. Alright.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.967
Why don't you try another shot

11:54.797 --> 11:57.967
at that spot right there?

11:58.009 --> 12:00.011
- That little spot over there?

11:58.009 --> 12:00.011
- Yeah.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.358
Well, you're pretty pathetic..

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
...except when you

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
stand right there.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.195
That's your sweet spot.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.532
I got a sweet spot?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.492
Apparently.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.118
When you play

12:22.534 --> 12:24.118
that game tomorrow..

12:24.160 --> 12:25.620
...just get to your sweet spot.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.372
That's the only chance

12:25.662 --> 12:27.372
you have of scoring.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.333
Right. Oh, yeah.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.333
Cool. Got a sweet spot.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.674
Yeah.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.843
Yeah, I got a sweet spot.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.846
Wait till I tell my wife.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.224
[instrumental music]

12:46.266 --> 12:48.351
[indistinct chattering]

12:48.393 --> 12:50.520
- Give it to me.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.520
- Okay, guys, let's warm it up.

12:50.562 --> 12:54.649
Alright. Okay, shoot a round.

12:50.562 --> 12:54.649
Alright. Okay, let's pass it.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.776
- Okay, guys. Come on.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.776
- Excuse me. Excuse me?

12:57.818 --> 13:01.072
You're Rebecca Donaldson

12:57.818 --> 13:01.072
from "Wake Up San Francisco."

13:01.114 --> 13:04.033
Would you mind if I got

13:01.114 --> 13:04.033
a picture for "The Chronicle?"

13:04.075 --> 13:06.911
Uh...uh, sure.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.497
Let me just

13:06.953 --> 13:09.497
put on my jacket.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.750
Your jacket?

13:09.539 --> 13:11.750
But that'll cover the blouse.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.002
You hate the blouse,

13:13.376 --> 13:15.002
don't you?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.046
No!

13:17.088 --> 13:18.923
No.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.175
I just love my jacket.

13:22.677 --> 13:25.764
That's okay, Aunt Becky.

13:22.677 --> 13:25.764
You can hate my blouse.

13:25.804 --> 13:29.016
See, now you don't

13:25.804 --> 13:29.016
have to lie anymore.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.603
Michelle, you've been so

13:29.058 --> 13:31.603
helpful through all of this.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.940
Well, at least

13:33.146 --> 13:35.940
she was honest.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.568
Steph, I'm sorry I

13:35.982 --> 13:38.568
lied about the blouse.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.903
Yeah, you should've

13:38.610 --> 13:40.903
told the truth like I did.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.447
It's nasty.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.243
What I should have done is

13:44.240 --> 13:47.243
just focused on the good points.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.203
The seams are straight.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.539
The fabric is beautiful.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.751
There are exactly as many

13:51.581 --> 13:54.751
holes as there are buttons.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.005
Nobody lost an eye.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.716
You're pushin' it.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.302
Steph, the point is, the blouse

14:01.758 --> 14:04.302
is not exactly my style

14:04.344 --> 14:07.013
but you did

14:04.344 --> 14:07.013
an excellent job on it.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.516
- You really think so?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.516
- Honest.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.064
Thanks.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.191
[whistle blows]

14:18.232 --> 14:20.109
Can I have your

14:18.232 --> 14:20.109
attention, please?

14:23.321 --> 14:26.324
- Jess, take a seat.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.324
- Oh, right. Sorry.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.997
Oh, hey. How you doin'?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.997
Came by to cheer me on, huh?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.542
- Somethin' like that.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.542
- Yeah.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.002
Thanks for coming out

14:35.583 --> 14:38.002
for such a worthy cause.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.253
Right now I'd like to introduce

14:39.295 --> 14:41.255
our celebrity referee

14:39.295 --> 14:41.255
for the game.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.050
He's the all-time

14:41.297 --> 14:44.050
leading scorer in the NBA

14:44.091 --> 14:46.386
was voted most valuable

14:44.091 --> 14:46.386
player six times

14:46.427 --> 14:48.346
and is considered one

14:46.427 --> 14:48.346
of the greatest players

14:48.388 --> 14:50.097
in the history of basketball.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.099
Huh. See? You love basketball.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.977
Guess you're pretty excited

14:52.141 --> 14:54.977
about seein' this guy, huh?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.312
- I've seen him before.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.312
- Oh, yeah?

14:56.354 --> 14:57.647
Yeah.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.691
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:57.689 --> 14:59.691
the one and only

14:59.733 --> 15:01.609
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.696
[crowd cheering]

15:13.120 --> 15:15.582
Wait a minute. What? What?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.582
You're him? He's you?

15:15.623 --> 15:18.877
- You gotta be somebody.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.877
- Yeah. Hi, Kareem.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.044
Hi.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.254
[whistle blows]

15:21.838 --> 15:23.423
[indistinct]

15:23.464 --> 15:26.050
Okay, guys, now go out there

15:23.464 --> 15:26.050
and play your hearts out.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.637
And remember, win or lose, after

15:26.092 --> 15:29.637
the game, we hit the hot tub.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.349
Okay, guys, now the only way

15:31.264 --> 15:33.349
we're gonna win this game

15:33.391 --> 15:34.975
is if we spread

15:33.391 --> 15:34.975
the ball around.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.853
Okay, dad, I want you

15:35.017 --> 15:36.853
to take half the shots

15:36.895 --> 15:38.354
and I want Joey to

15:36.895 --> 15:38.354
take half the shots.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.106
Okay, great.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.733
Where's my half?

15:41.775 --> 15:45.319
Uh, Uncle Jesse, you're-you're

15:41.775 --> 15:45.319
our defensive specialist.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.363
You'll be guarding

15:45.361 --> 15:47.363
their highest scorer.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.657
See, I'll be guardin'

15:47.405 --> 15:49.657
the highest scorer.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.825
Who's that?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.828
My guess is whoever

15:50.867 --> 15:53.828
you're guarding.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.996
Guys, you don't understand.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.996
See, I have a sweet spot.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.417
Hey, I have a stiff neck

15:59.459 --> 16:01.795
We got a game to play.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.631
Okay, guys, remember. First one

16:01.836 --> 16:04.631
to 12 baskets is the winner.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.757
- Right.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.757
- Hands in.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.634

16:05.799 --> 16:07.634

17:18.705 --> 17:21.248
Time! Time out!

17:21.290 --> 17:23.501
Okay, guys.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.794
You, guys, you're

17:23.543 --> 17:24.794
playing great, okay?

17:24.836 --> 17:26.713
- Thank you.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.713
- Now, the score is 11-11.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.507
So, next basket wins it. Now, we

17:26.754 --> 17:29.507
need to set up a special play.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.258
So this is what

17:29.549 --> 17:31.258
I want you to do.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.511
Dad, I want you to go

17:31.300 --> 17:33.511
to the top of the key.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.388
Joey, I want you to come

17:33.553 --> 17:35.388
up and set a pick for dad.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.430
- Okay?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.430
- What do I do?

17:36.472 --> 17:37.473
And Uncle Jesse, you

17:37.515 --> 17:39.517
just stay away from everybody.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.936
Come on, guys. Someone

17:39.559 --> 17:41.936
just give me the ball.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.145
Jess, last time

17:41.978 --> 17:43.145
you had the ball

17:43.187 --> 17:44.981
y-you picked it up

17:43.187 --> 17:44.981
and you ran with it.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.399
That's 'cause every

17:45.023 --> 17:46.399
time I bounce it

17:46.440 --> 17:48.484
some guy takes

17:46.440 --> 17:48.484
it away from me.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.778
You're really makin' us wanna

17:48.526 --> 17:50.778
throw it to you more and more.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.989
Come on, guys. Give me the ball.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.989
I know I can make the shot.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.699
I-I have a sweet

17:53.031 --> 17:54.699
spot, you know?

17:54.741 --> 17:55.783
Just throw me the ball and I'll

17:55.825 --> 17:58.661

17:58.703 --> 18:00.872
I mean...I-I-I just

17:58.703 --> 18:00.872
wanna show my kids

18:00.914 --> 18:02.582
that I'm not

18:00.914 --> 18:02.582
a complete loser.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.418
Come on. The guy's kids are

18:02.623 --> 18:05.418
watching. Give him a break.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.588
- He might surprise someone.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.588
- Yeah. Thank you, Kareem.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.051
You know, if we give

18:11.090 --> 18:13.051
Uncle Jesse the ball

18:13.092 --> 18:15.553
it might surprise everybody.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.263
Okay, this is

18:15.595 --> 18:17.263
for all the marbles.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.098
- We set up Uncle Jesse.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.098
- 'Yes. Yes.'

18:19.139 --> 18:20.558
I won't let you guys down.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.517
[whistle blows]

18:21.559 --> 18:23.811
(together)

18:21.559 --> 18:23.811
And break!

18:23.853 --> 18:25.688
Alright. Hey,

18:23.853 --> 18:25.688
Uncle Jesse, good luck.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.274
- I know you can do it.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.274
- Oh, you do, huh?

18:28.315 --> 18:30.526
Well, I'm the coach.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.526
It's my job to say that.

18:32.319 --> 18:36.198
Okay, guys. Let's go.

18:32.319 --> 18:36.198
You got Danny.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.325
You got Joey.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.078
And you got me

18:38.367 --> 18:40.078
on a bear skin rug.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.878
Didn't I tell

18:46.834 --> 18:48.878
you to stop that?

18:53.758 --> 18:55.134
[whistle blows]

18:59.097 --> 19:01.682
Hey, excuse me, excuse me.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.682
You're on my sweet spot.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.476
They're gonna throw

19:01.724 --> 19:03.476
me the ball any minute.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.104
- Jess, get open.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.104
- I can't. He's on..

19:06.145 --> 19:07.939
Kareem, he's on my sweet spot.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.652
I can't find pants.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.652
Get over it.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.320
(Danny)

19:12.693 --> 19:14.320
'Jess!'

19:14.361 --> 19:16.114
Jess, you're open.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.114
Shoot it.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.993
- The guy's on my sweet spot.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.993
- Just shoot!

19:20.034 --> 19:22.578
[intense music]

19:28.918 --> 19:30.377
[all cheering]

19:30.419 --> 19:31.712
[whistle blows]

19:34.423 --> 19:36.425
- I can't believe you did that.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.425
- Oh, my God.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.719
- That was great.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.719
- Wow.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.596
- That was an amazing shot.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.596
- Aw, thanks, Kareem.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.056
You know, let me

19:40.638 --> 19:42.056
tell you something

19:42.098 --> 19:43.390
you taught me everything,

19:42.098 --> 19:43.390
and I'll tell ya

19:43.432 --> 19:45.018
from this day on

19:43.432 --> 19:45.018
every single person

19:45.059 --> 19:46.102
that I meet, I'm gonna say

19:46.144 --> 19:47.269
"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

19:47.311 --> 19:49.188
taught me how to

19:47.311 --> 19:49.188
play basketball."

19:49.229 --> 19:51.482
Why don't we keep that

19:49.229 --> 19:51.482
as our little secret?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.860
- Nice meeting you folks.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.860
- Okay.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.320
- Bye.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.320
- Goodbye, Kareem.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.197
Uncle Jesse, I should

19:56.362 --> 19:58.197
have had more faith in you.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.574
I mean, who would have

19:58.238 --> 20:00.574
thought in a million, billion

20:00.616 --> 20:02.284
<i>trillion</i> years

20:00.616 --> 20:02.284
you would ever--

20:02.326 --> 20:03.536
You're congratulating

20:02.326 --> 20:03.536
me, right?

20:03.577 --> 20:04.787
Well, what she's

20:03.577 --> 20:04.787
trying to say

20:04.829 --> 20:06.330
is, you know,

20:04.829 --> 20:06.330
to hit that shot

20:06.372 --> 20:08.332
under that kinda pressure.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.332
I mean, you, of all people--

20:08.374 --> 20:09.917
Jess, if I, if I

20:08.374 --> 20:09.917
may, I-I think

20:09.959 --> 20:11.377
what they're both

20:09.959 --> 20:11.377
trying to say is

20:11.418 --> 20:13.212
you, uh, you

20:11.418 --> 20:13.212
really came through

20:13.253 --> 20:15.548
for us. You are our hero.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.467
Oh, well, thanks.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.467
I'm glad you think so.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.344
I just hope the boys

20:18.509 --> 20:20.344
feel the same way.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.346
Excuse me a second.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.808
Hey, boys. Hey, did you see your

20:22.388 --> 20:25.808
old man make the winning basket?

20:25.850 --> 20:30.437
- Pretty cool, huh?

20:25.850 --> 20:30.437
- Uh...Jess, they missed it.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.732
What?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.651
We were on a potty run.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.487
I went number one.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.575
Oh. You did?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.575
Th-that's very good, son.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.744
I watched.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.581
I can't believe you guys

20:46.245 --> 20:48.581
missed my winning shot.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.707
I mean, the whole reason

20:48.622 --> 20:49.707
why I was out there was to

20:49.749 --> 20:51.000
make you guys proud of me.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.835
Honey, they're

20:51.042 --> 20:52.835
already proud of you.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.796
What? For what? What did I do? I

20:52.877 --> 20:55.796
mean, they didn't see anything.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.424
The only thing they

20:55.838 --> 20:58.424
saw was tinkle town.

20:58.465 --> 21:02.011
We saw you

20:58.465 --> 21:02.011
fall down a lot.

21:02.053 --> 21:06.057
You fell down

21:02.053 --> 21:06.057
more than anybody.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.267
Yeah. Real cool.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.267
Big accomplishment.

21:08.308 --> 21:12.146
Oh, honey, don't you see?

21:08.308 --> 21:12.146
It doesn't matter what you do.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.690
You're their dad.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.690
You're their hero.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.944
You could be the worst

21:14.732 --> 21:17.944
basketball player ever.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.446
Which you probably are.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.823
And they would

21:20.487 --> 21:22.823
still be proud of you.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.367
- We love you, daddy.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.367
- Aw.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.580
Thank you, son.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.580
Give me a kissy. Muah.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.415
Now I feel

21:29.622 --> 21:31.415
like a real hero.

21:31.457 --> 21:35.461
Listen, guys, before I hang

21:31.457 --> 21:35.461
up my, uh, basketball cleats..

21:35.502 --> 21:37.046
...there's somethin'

21:35.502 --> 21:37.046
I wanna show you.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.590
Number one?

21:39.632 --> 21:42.260
No, son. Not number one.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.345
I wanna show you how, how I make

21:42.301 --> 21:45.345
a basket from my sweet spot.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.473
See, watch your old man here.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.688
Uh, honey? Th-that's okay.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.688
We believe you.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.983
Now l-l-let me just,

21:54.730 --> 21:56.983
let me just make one ball.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.573
See? That. One..

22:04.615 --> 22:07.701
[instrumental music]

22:15.168 --> 22:17.711
Hold on. Hold on.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.131
My sweet spot was

22:17.753 --> 22:20.131
around here somewhere.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.759
Alright. I think I

22:21.299 --> 22:23.759
got, I got it now.

22:23.801 --> 22:24.885
Watch your old man.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.929
[theme music]

22:26.971 --> 22:28.472
Whoa. See? I was, I was..

22:28.514 --> 22:31.225
It was the wind thing...again.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.978
Let me try one of those

22:31.267 --> 22:33.978
skyhawk shots that Kareem does.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.649
Almost, almost.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.693
Who could have thought,

22:38.691 --> 22:40.693
Kareem Abdul?

22:40.734 --> 22:43.070
You know, I always thought

22:40.734 --> 22:43.070
it was that little dancer.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.533
Go figure.
