God, I despise teenagers.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.395
Mom?

01:01.429 --> 01:02.296
What?

01:02.330 --> 01:03.197
Good.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.333
[laugh]

01:05.366 --> 01:07.801
Shut up.

01:07.835 --> 01:08.702
You OK?

01:08.736 --> 01:11.439
Oh, I'm going to kill my boss.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.241
She was so nasty to
me today, you know,

01:13.274 --> 01:17.178
like it's my fault he can't
get into Northwestern.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.847
I know just might
make you feel better.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.549
Me too, but I bet
it's a different list

01:21.582 --> 01:24.218
that what you got.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.819
Why don't you stack
them sandwiches over there

01:25.853 --> 01:27.020
on a plate for me.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.223
I got to go to Handy J and
get your chips and soda

01:29.257 --> 01:30.824
and all kinds of other stuff.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.626
What sandwiches?

01:32.660 --> 01:34.795
I see flap meat,
and I see bread,

01:34.828 --> 01:37.030
but I don't see no sandwiches.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.899
Oh, boing!

01:38.932 --> 01:42.636
Did you want me to make
them meatloaf sandwiches?

01:42.670 --> 01:45.239
Oh, could you?

01:45.273 --> 01:46.607
Oh, are you kidding?

01:46.640 --> 01:48.676
I've been standing behind
the counter preparing

01:48.709 --> 01:49.943
food for people all day.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.612
And I will say,
right now, there is

01:51.645 --> 01:55.216
nothing more I'd rather do than
make sandwiches for you, Dan.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.185
Why, then, we're
both in heaven.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.852
And you know what
the beauty part

01:58.886 --> 02:01.855
is, once the guys get here,
you'll never have to set foot

02:01.889 --> 02:03.724
in this kitchen again tonight.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.059
Why, are you banning me?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.495
Key wrecked.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.629
Well, then I'm
going to miss out

02:08.662 --> 02:10.498
on all that fascinating
conversation

02:10.531 --> 02:12.099
you have during
these card games.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.401
You know, like,
are the Cubs going

02:13.434 --> 02:15.203
to make it to the
Super Bowl, or should I

02:15.236 --> 02:17.571
use snow tires or chains?

02:17.605 --> 02:21.542
Mom, you want
me to read to you?

02:21.575 --> 02:22.510
Frog and toad?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.077
Yeah.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.846
Hit it.

02:25.879 --> 02:30.884
I will go to Toad's
house, said dog.

02:30.918 --> 02:37.825
I will rake all of the leaves
that have fallen on his lawn.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.494
Toad will be-- [mumbling]

02:40.528 --> 02:43.664
Oh, I'll take care of this.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.498
Surprised!

02:47.301 --> 02:49.703
Here, don't tell your father.

02:49.737 --> 02:53.341
Toad looked out of his window.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.310
These messy leaves have
covered everything, said Toe.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.212
[door bell rings]

02:58.246 --> 03:00.948
Oh, let me.

03:00.981 --> 03:01.982
[door bell rings]

03:02.015 --> 03:02.816
I'm coming!

03:08.222 --> 03:09.523
Oh, hi, Arnie.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.725
Hey, Rosie, where's
the man of the house?

03:11.759 --> 03:12.993
He's in the kitchen reading.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.234
Oh, snazzy shirt.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.402
You want it?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.404
Why, are you going
to give it to me?

03:23.437 --> 03:24.505
No, cut it out.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.106
No, if you want it,
I want you to have it.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.775
No, you keep your shirt on.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.411
You just missed out on
your golden opportunity.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.413
Hey, Deej.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.315
- Hi.
- Buddy.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.751
You got to move, honey,
we're setting up the table.

03:37.785 --> 03:41.088
OK, I'll go eat in my
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.727
Hey, Rosie, let me
ask you something--

03:46.760 --> 03:48.228
and be honest with me because--

03:48.262 --> 03:49.530
well, you're always
honest with me,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.332
but most women are
not always honest.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.567
Oh, you mean, like most men?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.935
I think men are honest.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.704
- That's a lie.
- OK, it's a lie.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.306
But most women aren't
always that honest either.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.373
Yeah, they are.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.410
OK, they are, but
hypothetical situation--

04:02.443 --> 04:04.445
you got a guy and a gal living
together for, let's say,

04:04.478 --> 04:07.348
19 months, shared
expenses on everything,

04:07.381 --> 04:08.716
including storage
for a boat they

04:08.749 --> 04:11.552
use five weeks out of the year.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.587
And Sharon's pushing
you to marry her.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.022
And sell the boat.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.256
Well, do you love her?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.157
Do I love her?

04:17.190 --> 04:18.058
Be serious.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.660
No jokes.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.829
Yeah, I love her.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.031
I love her.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.499
Then don't marry her.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.369
Why not?

04:28.402 --> 04:30.203
Because you marry
her, you'll be happy.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.805
And you obviously
don't want to be happy,

04:31.839 --> 04:33.774
or you would have
married her by now.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.377
I'm still a little unclear
about this boat thing.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.547
Well, you treat Sharon like
you treat your boat, right?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.914
OK, you love your boat, right?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.049
You want to be with your boat.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.352
You want to keep your
boat forever and ever.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.919
Yeah, but someday I'd
like to get a bigger one.

04:49.457 --> 04:53.226
Just stay with me on this.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.663
So maybe your boat needs
like, some security, you know.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.465
It needs a dock to
come home to at night.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.000
So maybe it needs a little
rope around its cleat

05:00.033 --> 05:02.370
so it doesn't just
drift that way.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.538
So what are you saying, we
should split the mooring fees?

05:08.709 --> 05:11.645
I'm saying, if you don't
take care of your boat,

05:11.679 --> 05:12.980
it's just going to
drift away and you're

05:13.013 --> 05:15.115
going to lose it forever.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.650
You're right.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.085
Thank you.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.120
I'm always right.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.356
How did Dan get
to be so lucky?

05:22.390 --> 05:26.293
I don't know, being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.631
Roseanne, you are
really a wonderful woman.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.207
DAN: You think you can park
any further up on my lawn?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.108
ARNIE: Buddy!

05:41.141 --> 05:43.577
DAN: Hello, Arnie.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.045
Yeah.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.480
Hey, Rosie, how're you doing?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.381
All right.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.315
Hi, Rosie.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.725
Hello, I would like to
talk to our Jackie Harris.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.428
Please, this is her sister,
and it's an emergency.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.695
I'm a dentist.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.263
You want to know
why your head hurts?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.633
It's because your jaw
is out of alignment.

06:05.666 --> 06:09.202
Next time you put a finger in
my mouth and we'll bite it off.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.303
Connor, is Nuss playing?

06:10.337 --> 06:12.239
No, Rosie would not
let him in the house.

06:12.272 --> 06:16.510
I know some women who won't
let him in North America.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.011
Let's play some cards.

06:18.045 --> 06:18.912
What, with four?
No.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.881
No.
I won back my ante.

06:20.914 --> 06:21.782
Since when do you win?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.183
Since when does he ante?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.152
Please, you can't
play with four.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.454
[door bell rings]

06:26.487 --> 06:27.721
What are you talking about,
you can't play with four?

06:27.755 --> 06:28.956
We always--
GEORGE: Guys.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.924
George is number
five, first ace deals.

06:30.958 --> 06:31.892
All right.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.360
G-man, what's going on?
- Hey, hey.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.728
Well, I ain't
discriminating the night.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.564
I'm taking everybody's money.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.666
Nice sitting next
to a playing man.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.567
What you got in the bag?

06:39.600 --> 06:40.668
Oh, club soda.

06:40.701 --> 06:44.104
I promised my wife I
wouldn't drink tonight.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.072
Beer in the fridge?

06:45.105 --> 06:45.906
Yeah.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.243
So Nuss ain't coming, is he?

06:50.277 --> 06:52.913
No, Rosie won't
let him in the house.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.081
That's a good choice.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.082
What's the buy in?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.349
20 beans.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.318
I guess Andy is going to
be an hour late, as usual.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.420
I think the guy's
still in New York time.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.255
Hey, what do you
guys do, start early?

07:02.289 --> 07:03.356
We always start at 7:30.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.758
Danny, am I right?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.093
Hey.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.296
Which one of you hot dogs
wants to cash a check for me?

07:09.329 --> 07:10.430
That was perfect.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.533
Yeah, I'd rather have
Andy than Nuss any day.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.367
Nuss cheats.
- Well, at least he admits it.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.335
TOMMY: Mm-hmm.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.271
All right, five
card draw, ante up.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.340
Are these sandwiches?

07:20.373 --> 07:24.277
Yeah, they've been sneezed
on, but help yourself.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.178
Pass.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.614
You see anything, Diane?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.281
I don't know.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.619
What is that huge
disgusting brown thing?

07:31.652 --> 07:33.487
A meatloaf.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.523
I don't think you
have anything good.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.624
What do you feel like?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.959
I feel like I'm
getting a draft.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.393
Amscray.

07:40.427 --> 07:43.263
[men barking]

07:45.332 --> 07:48.035
Mom, we're going to the mall.

07:48.068 --> 07:48.936
I'm going, too.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.903
You are not.

07:49.937 --> 07:50.804
Is too.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.706
You don't own the mall, Becky.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.874
Yeah.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.475
In fact, I'm going
to follow behind you

07:55.509 --> 07:58.145
two feet the whole night
making disgusting noises.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.280
[blows raspberries]

08:00.313 --> 08:01.181
Hey, oh.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.415
You guys started already?

08:02.449 --> 08:03.751
Post time was 7:00, Andy.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.885
Come on, Dan.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.620
Game starts at 7:30,
it always does.

08:06.654 --> 08:07.521
Am I right?

08:07.555 --> 08:09.089
No.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.423
All right, all right.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.959
Which one of you hot dogs is
going to cash a check to me?

08:14.928 --> 08:15.863
Where's my seat?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.064
Here you go, play these.

08:17.097 --> 08:17.965
DAN: Where you going?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.767
Nowhere, I just want to stand.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.401
I see why.

08:21.434 --> 08:25.238
Hello, I'm trying to
reach Officer Jackie Harris.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.275
Yeah, this is her sister again.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.343
Oh, she did?

08:30.377 --> 08:31.244
Great.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.079
Thank you.

08:37.317 --> 08:41.388
Oh, the smell of testosterone.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.223
Mom, are you going
to come and read to me?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.424
Yeah, I'll be up in a minute.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.559
OK.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.827
Honey.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.929
Honey, could you do that later?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.166
Zach, it's to you.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.067
How much?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.903
DAN: 50 cents.

08:55.936 --> 08:56.804
Will you quit looking?

08:56.837 --> 08:57.871
Hey, I'm not looking.

08:57.905 --> 08:58.806
I didn't see anything.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.073
I don't care.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.709
I can't play with somebody
hopping around behind me.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.244
Arnie, are you going to
play poker or walk laps?

09:04.277 --> 09:05.278
OK, you're right.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.680
I'll just go flirt with Rosie.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.586
Hey, what are you making?

09:12.620 --> 09:17.891
um, oh, they're napkin
holders for D.J.'s PTA Bazaar.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.861
D.J.: Mom, I'm ready!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.863
Need some help?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.632
Yeah, here.

09:24.665 --> 09:28.769
Cut about 150 of those.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.470
You coming back down?

09:30.503 --> 09:33.540
No, I got a
heliport on the roof.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.976
They jumped into my
cars and drove away

09:36.009 --> 09:38.979
under the smoke-smuggered stars.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.682
Now all that was left
'neath the bad smelling

09:41.715 --> 09:48.221
sky was my big empty
factory, the Lorax, and I.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.659
Good, that's what he gets.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.727
And you know what
you're going to get?

09:53.761 --> 09:56.029
What?

09:56.063 --> 09:57.464
A great big smooch.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.766
No.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.568
What do you mean
no, I can't kiss you?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.470
No, I want to kiss you.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.238
I want to kiss you
like Daddy kisses you.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.708
[laughter]

10:10.778 --> 10:11.879
How does Daddy kiss me?

10:11.912 --> 10:12.713
Like this.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.552
Oh, that was a
very, very good kiss.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.228
Mom, will you
read me some more?

10:28.261 --> 10:30.964
Boy, you boys can just
never get enough, can you?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.304
Where the hell have you been?

10:37.337 --> 10:38.271
Roseanne, what's going on?

10:38.305 --> 10:39.973
I told you I was
coming over at 9:00.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.608
Dispatch said you
called like four times.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.810
You OK?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.144
ROSEANNE: I got, I just
got to ask you something.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.345
All right, what's going on?

10:45.378 --> 10:46.680
OK, what do you
think of those guys

10:46.714 --> 10:48.115
in there playing poker with Dan?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.416
Which guys?

10:49.449 --> 10:50.751
No!

10:50.784 --> 10:52.853
You don't even let me get
a chance to look at them now.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.287
OK, OK, OK.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.925
Hey, you know that guy Arnie
out there playing poker?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.126
Arnie.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.262
Oh, yeah.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.697
Yeah, what do
you think of him?

11:03.731 --> 11:04.732
You think he's an OK guy?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.566
I don't even know him.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.235
OK, well, he
works for the water

11:08.268 --> 11:09.236
and power company, and he--

11:09.269 --> 11:10.337
No.
No.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.638
Dan's known him
for a long time.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.073
- Roseanne!
- He's a nice person.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.842
No, you're not fixing
me up with Arnie.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.010
He's not my type.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.946
Why, don't you
think he's cute?

11:18.979 --> 11:20.547
Uh, I don't know.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.683
I think he's sweaty.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.352
What do you mean,
you think he's sweaty?

11:25.385 --> 11:26.253
I think he's sweaty.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.654
Well, all men are sweaty.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.690
Well, I think some men
are sweatier than other men.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.592
Maybe that's because
he's a hard worker.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.094
Wait a second.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.129
Isn't he practically
living with somebody?

11:36.163 --> 11:38.031
Yeah, he is living
with somebody,

11:38.065 --> 11:39.566
and I think they're
going to get married,

11:39.599 --> 11:41.301
too, which is what
makes what happened

11:41.334 --> 11:43.536
just all the more weirder.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.238
Ooh, what?

11:45.272 --> 11:46.139
Tell me.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.775
I can't tell you, Jackie.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.909
I can't tell you.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.377
I can't because you've
got a great big mouth

11:50.410 --> 11:51.544
and I really need
to be discreet.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.445
Roseanne.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.346
He kissed me.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.683
[jackie gasps]

11:56.716 --> 11:58.718
Now don't you think that
that is just a little--

11:58.752 --> 12:00.487
A little pushy, yeah.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.524
Yeah,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.559
Because I mean, like,
he's Dan's friend, you know?

12:06.593 --> 12:08.161
And I mean, we were
just hanging out

12:08.195 --> 12:09.162
because Dan went to the store.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.230
We were just talking
and everything.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.264
We start talking about women.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.399
He starts talking
about his girlfriend

12:12.432 --> 12:13.901
and how he doesn't know
anything about women,

12:13.934 --> 12:15.202
and before I know
it, he's kissing me.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.305
Now wait a second, is a
kissing you like kissing you,

12:18.338 --> 12:20.273
or was it just like a kiss?

12:20.307 --> 12:21.809
Well, he's kissing me.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.110
JACKIE: Oh!

12:23.143 --> 12:25.645
Well, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.347
No.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.983
No, it was just--
it was just a kiss.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.919
But it was on my neck, Jackie.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.087
Well, where exactly
on the neck was it?

12:34.121 --> 12:35.388
I mean, was it
just below the ear,

12:35.422 --> 12:37.190
or did he just brush
your cheek, or did

12:37.224 --> 12:41.094
he actually like move the hair,
and then give it to you there?

12:41.128 --> 12:42.896
No, no, no, no.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.864
Here.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.034
It was kind of
like, OK, stand up.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.669
OK, now put your arms around me.

12:49.702 --> 12:50.570
No, wait a second.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.472
OK now, OK, OK, you be me.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.673
You're over there.
OK.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.108
- What did you do?
- Well, I didn't know.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.443
I just stood there.
I didn't know what to do.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.544
I couldn't believe he did that.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.445
Did what?

12:58.478 --> 12:59.546
I don't even know what he did.

12:59.579 --> 13:03.416
Well, I'm trying to tell you.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.784
OK.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.887
So like we're just standing
here, right, and we're talking.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.889
OK, so let's just be talking.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.457
So how you doing?
- So how you been?

13:10.490 --> 13:11.624
- Hi, how you been?
- Nice shirt.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.659
Oh, see?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.294
I didn't even tell
you about that part.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.129
Oh, that is eerie.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.899
Oh, that is eerie.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.633
That's what I said to him
when he came in the door.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.634
Said what?

13:21.668 --> 13:24.404
I go, hi, Arnie,
I like your shirt.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.875
Well, that explains it.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.642
You led him on.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.112
No, come on, Jackie, come on.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.347
I got to tell you, OK, so I
go, nice shirt, Arnie, right?

13:34.381 --> 13:36.283
Then you starts
like taking it off,

13:36.316 --> 13:38.051
you know, like he's
going to give it to me.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.686
You're kidding.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.687
No.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.922
How long has Dan
known this guy?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.490
He comes over, he starts
taking his shirt off?

13:43.523 --> 13:44.858
That's a little strange.
- I told you!

13:44.892 --> 13:46.293
Now let me show
you the rest of it.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.061
OK, now you're standing there.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.297
All right, I'm standing
here, I'm talking, I'm you.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.665
OK, so I'm like, OK, now
let me ask you something.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.733
I'm being him.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.368
Uh, yeah, yeah.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.170
Let me ask you something.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.939
You know, and then we
start talking about women,

13:58.972 --> 14:00.807
and I said something real
sensitive and meaningful.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.043
You know, like how you got
to treat them like goddesses,

14:03.076 --> 14:05.245
you know, like the way that
Dan treats me and everything.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.246
So you're lying to him.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.380
Right.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.217
So I'm standing here and
I'm making sandwiches.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.818
So just make sandwiches.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.120
You're making sandwiches.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.055
And I go, well, you know, I
say something really nice.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.389
Well, you know, blah, blah blah.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.557
Well, thank you.
Now you be me.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.825
You say, well thank you.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.726
Thank you, Arnie.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.594
Roseanne, he comes up.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.164
You are the most incredible
woman I've ever met in my life

14:24.197 --> 14:25.765
and I mean that.

14:25.798 --> 14:29.602
Oh, you're kidding!

14:29.636 --> 14:33.640
Seven card, high-low,
bust your buddy.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.643
There'll be a $0.50 buy
at the end, and the seven

14:36.676 --> 14:37.544
of diamonds is wild.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.479
What, are we in college?

14:39.512 --> 14:40.780
I never went to college.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.882
Yeah, well I did, and we
didn't play crap like this.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.017
What's the difference?

14:44.051 --> 14:47.587
You're going to bluff anyway.
- Hey, Tommy?

14:47.620 --> 14:48.555
TOMMY: Hmm?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.457
Who smashed the
back of your Buick?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.892
Skid into a
lamppost last year.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.995
Thought I could get away with
radials instead of snow tires.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.063
No way.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.197
Not with the winters
we got around here.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.999
You got to have snow tires.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.333
I use chains.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.235
Chains make the car hum.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.670
And they tear up the road.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.938
What do I care?

15:04.972 --> 15:07.007
I pay taxes.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.042
Who didn't ante?

15:09.076 --> 15:11.844
What are you, my accountant?

15:11.878 --> 15:15.215
No, I'm not short enough.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.151
You think maybe I
should've slapped him?

15:18.185 --> 15:21.888
No, I think slapping him
would have been way too much.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.992
Well, do you think
I ought to tell Dan?

15:25.025 --> 15:27.594
I think it was just a kiss.

15:27.627 --> 15:31.198
Well, I don't do the kind
of volume that you do, Jackie.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.066
This doesn't happen
to me every day.

15:33.100 --> 15:33.967
OK.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.168
Don't tell Dan.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.137
Dan will just get mad and
start yelling at Arnie.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.406
Arnie will get mad back
at Dan, start yelling,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.274
they'll both be yelling,
waving their fists around

15:41.308 --> 15:43.543
and saying stupid macho
things back and forth.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.013
And then he'll never
kiss you again.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.251
Well, you think I should
have said something to Arnie?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.285
I mean, I'm married.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.521
I have three children.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.788
Well, you know
what, you're right.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.024
I don't like it
when a guy thinks

15:57.057 --> 15:59.626
he can come up and handle
you like a rubber thong

15:59.659 --> 16:02.495
in a discount bin.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.297
I hate it when a guy
kisses me before I've given

16:04.331 --> 16:06.933
him that unwritten green light.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.601
What's that all about?

16:08.635 --> 16:12.339
Well, you know,
a smile, the look.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.208
You catch a guy's eye,
hold it, and say yes.

16:15.242 --> 16:18.611
It's all done with the eyes.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.779
Well, do you
think I led him on?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.349
I mean, because I
was looking at him.

16:22.382 --> 16:26.553
Well, were you looking
at him like this?

16:26.586 --> 16:27.887
Or were you looking
at him like this?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.794
Well, I was kind of looking
at him, you know, like this.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.497
[laughter]

16:37.530 --> 16:39.966
Yeah, well, that's
a mixed message.

16:43.803 --> 16:44.671
Who's he calling?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.005
Helen.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.740
Still busy.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.941
Unbelievable.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.210
I'm sure she's fine.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.111
When is she due?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.279
Monday.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.946
Mazel tov.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.449
What?

16:56.483 --> 16:58.585
It's like, it's cool.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.486
Oh.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.155
[laughter]

17:02.189 --> 17:04.391
You know, Cynthia stays
on the phone hour a clip,

17:04.424 --> 17:05.292
man, like it's nothing.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.393
Yeah, Sharon, too.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.529
I think women have
an extra vocal cord.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.630
Want to bet?

17:10.663 --> 17:12.165
No, I'm just saying
they talk a lot.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.566
They like the gossip.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.501
I know, you want to bet?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.370
[laughter]

17:20.407 --> 17:21.774
When I get home
tonight, Helen is

17:21.808 --> 17:24.844
going to put down every one of
you guys, including your wives.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.379
That's because she'll
have been on the phone

17:26.413 --> 17:28.047
all night with
Cynthia, you know,

17:28.081 --> 17:31.484
talking about you, and
you, and especially you.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.720
Yack, yack, yack, yack,
yack, yack, yack, yack.

17:33.753 --> 17:34.754
It's like A sport.

17:34.787 --> 17:35.788
Right.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.190
And then they try
and get us involved.

17:37.224 --> 17:41.194
OK, like last night, Cynthia's
trying to tell me about Bobby

17:41.228 --> 17:42.529
Erickson and his wife.
MAN: That was terrible.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.131
MAN: Oh, yeah.
MAN: It was terrible.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.265
What about Bobby?

17:45.298 --> 17:46.466
They're splitting up.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.367
You didn't know that?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.268
Where'd you hear that?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.202
I heard it from Helen.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.104
I mean, Cynthia told her.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.639
They've been having
trouble for a long time.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.640
TOMMY: That's right.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.943
Bobby and Judy Erickson?

17:56.976 --> 17:58.278
Oh, yeah.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.280
Two months ago, Judy asked
me to start sending her bills

18:00.313 --> 18:01.881
to a different address.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.184
Thinks she's shacking
up with some guy?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.518
Ah, she's a tramp.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.586
You don't even know her.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.487
What's the difference?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.021
I think she's running around.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.324
Yeah, well, he's still had
on his track shoes for a while,

18:11.358 --> 18:12.459
too, you know.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.161
I think it was a
little equipment trouble.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.061
Oh!

18:15.094 --> 18:16.629
No way, man.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.598
Wait a second, Bobby and
I play football together.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.133
Yeah?
Must've been a real close team.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.775
Bottom line, Bobby's a slut.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.143
Eh, let's face it, guys.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.712
Just because he runs
around doesn't mean

18:32.745 --> 18:36.316
that she can run around, too.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.785
You know, Andy, that's
a rule enlightened view.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.553
Sort of a [babbling nonsense].

18:43.623 --> 18:46.493
[music playing]

18:59.972 --> 19:01.941
See you later, Rosie.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.376
How'd you do, George?

19:03.410 --> 19:05.245
Uh, I broke even.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.413
Lost 20 bucks.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.380
Ate five sandwiches.

19:07.414 --> 19:15.822
Is How'd you do, honey?

19:15.855 --> 19:18.024
Great I won 18 bucks.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.158
Well, great.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.993
Another 10,000 nights
like that, and you're

19:21.027 --> 19:23.029
going to have a great year.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.130
Well, I'm out of here.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.465
Thanks for the sandwiches.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.435
Hey, Arnie, you need any
help with that green monster?

19:28.468 --> 19:29.836
No, I got it.

19:29.869 --> 19:30.637
Good night.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.474
Goodnight, Jackie.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.648
See you.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.082
Yeah, tell Sharon I said hi.

19:43.115 --> 19:43.916
OK.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.058
What's he doing
kissing Jackie?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.669
Oh, Dan, it was just a kiss.

20:06.606 --> 20:11.043
Well, I guess I
really know men, huh?

20:11.077 --> 20:15.348
Well, I can see how you
might have mistook that.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.183
Yeah.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.150
It was just a kiss.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.486
What else was I
going to do tonight?

20:22.655 --> 20:23.756
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.224
Oh, yeah, I'll see you.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.197
[music playing]

20:43.743 --> 20:47.113
[rhythmic tapping]

21:01.127 --> 21:04.163
(SINGING) Come and listen to
my story about a man named Jed.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.633
He was poor mountaineer, he
barely kept his family fed.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.035
Then one day he was
a-shooting at the food

21:09.068 --> 21:12.372
when up through the ground
come a bubbling crude.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.775
Oil, that is.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.743
Black gold.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.112
Black gold, Texas tea.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.982
Well, the first thing you
know, old Jed's a millionaire.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.251
The kinfolk said, Jed,
move away from there.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.321
They said California is
the place you ought to be.

21:28.355 --> 21:32.759
So they loaded up a truck
and they moved to Beverly.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.728
Hills, that is.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.196
Swimming pools.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.097
Movie stars.

21:41.167 --> 21:45.638
K-E- double L, O double
G, Kellogg's best to you!

21:45.672 --> 21:47.139
Oh, yeah.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.641
Yo!
