-[officer] Pull over, Private.
-[von Loesch] Stop.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.840

03:38.800 --> 03:40.560
[commander] What's he asking for?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.640
[officer] Freedom in a country
of his choice.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.480
And a generous pension
to last the rest of his lifetime.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.360
[commander]
Well, let's see how good it is first.

[man 1] Enter.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.680
[man with file] Sir.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.000
I'm going to need to speak
to the Prime Minister.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.320
I need to see the King.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.840
[King George] We all suspected it.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.200
These papers must never see
the light of day, Winston. Ever.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.720
Publication could do grave harm
to the national interest.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.280
[King George] The gravest.

06:29.600 --> 06:35.200
What is written here brings
the greatest shame upon this family.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.000
[sighs]

06:38.360 --> 06:41.600
Our people would, rightfully,
never forgive us.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
[man on TV]  The mighty Harringay Arena
in London

07:59.120 --> 08:03.080
draws a capacity crowd of over 11,000
for the first meeting in Britain

08:03.160 --> 08:06.800
of the American evangelist team,
headed by Billy Graham.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.920
Mr. Graham, who wears a slate-gray suit
and a modest tie,

08:10.040 --> 08:12.800
makes his address
from a purple-draped platform.

08:13.480 --> 08:17.560
[Billy on TV]  The Bible teaches
that all of us are wrong.

08:18.680 --> 08:23.360
We have all gone astray,
with everyone turned to his own way.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.280
And when you turn...

08:25.360 --> 08:28.760
It's rare and not entirely reassuring
to see religious certainty

08:28.840 --> 08:30.800
-in someone so young.
-[crowd on TV applauds]

08:30.880 --> 08:35.240
-He's not young; he's my age.
-Precisely. A child.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.640
[Queen Mother] I think moral authority
and spiritual guidance

08:38.720 --> 08:41.159
should come from someone
with a little life experience.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.360
Not from someone
who learned their trade selling brushes

08:44.440 --> 08:45.960
door to door in North Carolina.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.320
But there's a humility to that
which I like.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.800
Are those people crying?

08:49.880 --> 08:51.360
[man on TV]  Billy Graham has spoken to

08:51.440 --> 08:53.120
more than one and a half
million people...

08:53.200 --> 08:56.000
-What's happening to this country?
-Now, he sums up his crusade.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.400
The people of Great Britain
never cried during the war.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.640
Now they're weeping like children.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.000
[Billy on TV]  I'm calling for a revival
that will cause every man and woman

09:04.080 --> 09:06.200
to return to their offices and shops

09:06.280 --> 09:10.200
and live out the teachings of Christ
in their daily relationships.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.160
I'm going to preach a gospel,
not of despair, but of hope.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.280
Hope for the individual,
hope for society, hope for the world.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.760
Turning out in droves
for an American zealot.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.720
He's not a zealot.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.160
He's shouting, darling.
Only zealots shout.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.080
[Billy continues]
When you close your eyes,

09:28.160 --> 09:30.640
close your ears to God's way,

09:30.720 --> 09:35.080
you will soon prefer your own ideas
to the ideas of God.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.360
You come to a stage where your own evil
seems to you good

09:40.440 --> 09:46.120
-and God's good seems to be evil.

Don't tell me.
The same as every other day.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.560
I rose late. Past 11.
Then inspected the gardens.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.600
Then ate lunch with people
of no consequence.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.640
-My friends!
-People of no consequence.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.960
I never thought I'd hear myself say it,

12:44.040 --> 12:46.880
but a life of pleasure
really has its limits.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.000
Try a life spent living with you.

12:53.880 --> 12:59.880
My motto, as Prince of Wales,
was  "Ich dien."   "I serve."

13:01.520 --> 13:06.000
Deeply rooted within me
is a need to serve my country.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.240
I need a job, a purpose.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.840
-Not this again.
-Yes, this.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.280
Well, where do you intend to find one?

13:13.360 --> 13:18.520
I will simply have to go to London
to set things in motion.

13:18.600 --> 13:22.240
Shall I tell you what else is deeply
rooted within your family? Delusion.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.120
They won't let you in the country,
let alone give you a job.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.560
-That's not what my lawyer says.
-You've spoken to George?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.320
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Well, I'm telling you now.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.640
I still have allies, you know,
important allies.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.800
Disciples of the truth,
advocates of justice,

13:37.880 --> 13:41.200
who could mobilize opinion,

13:41.280 --> 13:47.440
start a campaign... to have
a former king be forgiven.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.160
[phone rings]

13:58.600 --> 14:01.320
Finally, there's a request, ma'am,
from the government,

14:01.400 --> 14:04.080
for you to open the new airport
at Gatwick.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.960
Um, they've offered some dates.
Third of June works best for us, I think.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.520
-[Elizabeth] Yes, all right.
-And that is it from me.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.040
[Elizabeth] Thank you, Michael.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.080
-Oh, there was something.
-There was--

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
[Michael] Ma'am.

14:19.120 --> 14:24.120
If I wished to meet Reverend Graham,
do you think that could be arranged?

14:26.440 --> 14:27.520
The evangelist, ma'am?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.080
Yes.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.840
[Michael] Well, I should need
to give it some thought.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.920
Um...

14:37.640 --> 14:41.160
One might imagine
an invitation being extended

14:41.240 --> 14:47.960
to preach at All Saints' Chapel at Windsor
and a private lunch to follow?

14:48.360 --> 14:49.520
Lovely.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.920
We should have to be careful,
though, ma'am,

14:53.000 --> 14:57.080
that any invitation to,
or association with, Reverend Graham,

14:57.160 --> 15:00.320
not be perceived as an endorsement
of his...

15:02.640 --> 15:03.920
crusades,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.160
which would not be compatible with
your role as the head of the Church.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.360
I'm sure you'll handle it all perfectly,
Michael.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.000
And you had something?

15:11.680 --> 15:13.480
[hesitant] Yes, um...

15:14.080 --> 15:18.120
His Royal Highness, the Duke of Windsor,
has written with a request.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.360
-[Philip] Oh.
-What for?

15:21.080 --> 15:24.040
-To be allowed to enter the country.
-Denied!

15:24.120 --> 15:26.720
[Michael] To research a book
which he's planning to write.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.640
On what subject?

15:27.720 --> 15:31.240
How To Be a Truly Great King:
a Guidebook.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.320
-[Elizabeth] Mm.
-[chuckles]

15:33.960 --> 15:35.040
[Michael] He didn't say.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.320
I suppose we could let him stay
at Kensington Palace.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.800
He's intending to stay
with his friend Major Metcalfe.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.600
Fruity? But doesn't he live in Surrey?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.960
-Sussex, I believe.
-Oh, that's quite good.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.960
-Out of public eye.
-The further the better, if you ask me.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.560
So, that is a yes.

15:51.640 --> 15:52.600
-No!
-Yes.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.120
-No.
-Yes.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.680
Yes, let him come.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
Ma'am.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.280
[car door slams]

16:15.600 --> 16:17.520
-Morning.
-[archivist] Good morning, sir.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.440
-[man] Uh, did you finish that paperwork?
-Yes, sir.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.480
-Thank you.
-[woman] This one's for Mr. Sweet.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.640
-This one for...
-[man] Morning, Margaret.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.560
Morning, sir. Monsieur Robert.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.760
[archivist] Yes, ma'am.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.680
[typewriter clicks, dings]

16:50.440 --> 16:51.840
Take a look at this.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.680
It's practically an injunction.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.040
[Margaret] Sir.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.840
Are you aware of this?

17:05.720 --> 17:06.560
I am.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.880
As historians, we have a duty to publish
the truth, no exceptions.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.440
Otherwise, what are we all doing?
Protecting Nazis?

17:16.520 --> 17:18.319
Protecting something else.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.000
My hands are tied.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.400
But his are not.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.880
That's right.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.720
I have access to the US State Department
duplicate files.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.319
[French man] Including this.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.840
There's nothing to stop
the American government publishing

17:31.920 --> 17:33.320
if the British government won't.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.200
[train whistles]

17:44.320 --> 17:46.560
[Duke]  "My dearest darling Peaches,

17:46.640 --> 17:50.600
let us hope the rest of the trip
is not as miserable as the journey.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.600
It was a most disagreeable crossing,
due to bad weather.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.520
The company on the boat
was dreadful too,

17:57.600 --> 17:59.720
common and uninteresting people,

17:59.800 --> 18:03.280
pestering me to join them for drinks
or play cards.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.040
On arrival in London,
my mood was lifted slightly

18:09.120 --> 18:13.440
by a large group of welcoming supporters
who cheered my name

18:13.520 --> 18:15.560
-and removed their hats.
-[camera clicks]

18:15.640 --> 18:19.800
And my niece, the Queen,
sent me one of the hearses.

18:24.360 --> 18:28.440
Later in the evening I feared things
would go from bad to worse,

18:28.520 --> 18:33.440
as we arrived at Fruity's rather drab
little house, somewhere in Sussex."

18:37.840 --> 18:39.040
[Duke] Fruity.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.840
-Your Royal Highness.
-How are you?

18:40.920 --> 18:42.840
-Very well.
-Your Royal Highness.

18:42.920 --> 18:43.920
Baba dear.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.800
[Duke]  "But George excelled, as ever, and
revealed the work he had already done."

18:48.880 --> 18:51.800
[man] Of course the true purpose
of the visit can't be known to anybody.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.360
Should anyone get wind of any
"job hunting" by His Royal Highness,

18:55.440 --> 18:59.880
it might be seen as a violation of
the agreement made after the abdication

19:00.000 --> 19:01.840
and His Royal Highness might find himself

19:01.920 --> 19:06.080
not only being asked to leave the country,
but also without a pension.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.640
So, this trip must be perceived,
first and foremost, as a literary one.

19:11.720 --> 19:15.360
-[Fruity] I trust you came prepared.
-I brought quill and ink.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.280
[laughter]

19:17.360 --> 19:18.800
[man] All that notwithstanding,

19:19.360 --> 19:21.440
I've started a campaign,

19:22.400 --> 19:24.320
gathering friends and supporters.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.360
And early indications
are most encouraging.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.960
Walter Monckton has agreed
to host a dinner,

19:29.040 --> 19:31.920
and we've had "yesses"
from Lord Salisbury, Lord Beaverbrook,

19:32.000 --> 19:37.480
Lord Dudley, the American ambassador
and the Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.040
Ooh, Cecil Beaton and Noel Coward

19:40.120 --> 19:42.560
have agreed to hold
a little supper party for you.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.440
-Oh, dear Cecil...
-[laughter]

19:45.520 --> 19:47.360
...and his inedible food.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.880
[cars approaching]

20:11.880 --> 20:16.560
-[Philip] Do we really have to do this?
-Indulge me. I'm interested.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.640
Couldn't you just make up an excuse
and say I'm off sinning somewhere?

20:21.720 --> 20:22.720
No.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.480
[car doors slamming]

20:27.360 --> 20:29.160
[Philip] Lanky bugger, isn't he?

20:29.240 --> 20:30.880
I think he's rather handsome.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.240
A door-to-door salesman
in a hideous shiny suit.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.760
-Where's his box?
-What box?

20:36.840 --> 20:39.800
-The one containing his brushes.
-Oh, no, look.

20:39.880 --> 20:43.080
-Come on. We'll be late.
-Hair brushes. Floor brushes.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.880
-Toothbrushes.
-Do shut up, Philip.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.960
[Billy] As I was thinking about
what to preach about today,

20:49.040 --> 20:52.360
I considered various topics
which speak to me personally,

20:52.440 --> 20:55.800
but I thought that I would start
with a simple question.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.600
What is a Christian?

21:00.360 --> 21:03.360
The Bible tells us; Colossians 1:27 says

21:03.440 --> 21:09.280
that a Christian
is a person in whom Christ dwells.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.880
It's Christ in you.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.680
The hope of glory.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.800
It means that you have
a personal relationship

21:15.880 --> 21:17.760
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.720
That encounter has taken place.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.000
You have received Christ as savior.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.920
And that is what a Christian is.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.640
[Elizabeth] I enjoyed that very much.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.320
You do speak with such wonderful clarity
and certainty.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.280
-[door closes]
-I find it very reassuring.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.800
And it's not only me.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.680
The rest of the country are too,
I imagine.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.080
-Yes.
-[Elizabeth chuckles]

21:50.160 --> 21:52.240
We've been surprised ourselves
at the turnout.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.840
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.760
Well, you shouldn't be.

21:55.840 --> 22:00.520
In an increasingly complex world,
we all need certainty, and you provide it.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.640
Well, that's not me.
The scriptures provide it.

22:04.160 --> 22:09.440
Yes, but you illuminate them
so well. [inhales]

22:09.520 --> 22:13.880
The great joy that I have felt today was
that of being a simple congregant,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.800
being taught, being led.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.440
You see, as head of the Anglican Church,
in terms of rank,

22:19.520 --> 22:23.880
even the great Archbishops of York
and Canterbury are below me.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.040
Above me there is only God.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.680
-Well, that must be lonely sometimes.
-Yes, it is. [chuckles]

22:33.040 --> 22:39.680
Which is why it's lovely, as Queen,
to be able to just disappear and be...

22:40.760 --> 22:42.240
[Billy] A simple Christian.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.200
Yes. [sighs]

22:46.880 --> 22:51.920
Above all things, I do think of myself
as just a simple Christian.

22:53.400 --> 22:57.880
It's the values of Christian living
that root me, guide me.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.320
Define me.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.400
Have you always been
such a good speaker?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.680
I was actually a shy child.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.560
-No.
-Mm-hm.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.120
Speaking as a shy child myself,

23:14.200 --> 23:16.600
I have to say that I find that
very hard to believe.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.840
-[both chuckle]
-No, ma'am, it's true.

23:19.680 --> 23:25.160
The first time I ever spoke in public,
I was 12 years old. At school.

23:25.680 --> 23:29.160
The school principal told my mother
he thought I was a natural,

23:29.720 --> 23:33.600
that, of all things, I had a gift.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.280
[car doors slam]

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
[car door slams]

24:31.360 --> 24:33.400
[Macmillan]  I've no objection
to his being here.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.440
-It's the word "crusade" that troubles me.
-[laughter]

24:39.800 --> 24:43.800
If the Reverend Graham is the crusader,
the implication is that we're heathens!

24:43.880 --> 24:46.200
-[laughter]
-[Macmillan] Not sure I go along with it.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.200
Mr. Wheeler-Bennett, sir.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.640
-Ah, excuse me.
-[laughter]

24:51.720 --> 24:55.440
-[phone rings]
-[men continue chatting]

24:55.520 --> 24:57.560
Prime Minister. Thank you for seeing me.

24:57.640 --> 25:02.720
You didn't give me much choice.
"A matter of the greatest urgency."

25:02.800 --> 25:05.600
Your team of troublesome historians?

25:05.680 --> 25:08.800
Committed historians.
Principled historians.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.800
-Is that the file in question?
-Yes.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Let's make a start.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.120
-[laughter]
-[chatter]

25:21.200 --> 25:24.080
-Ah, there you are! Plotters all!
-[guests chuckle]

25:24.160 --> 25:25.480
[guests] Your Royal Highness.

25:25.560 --> 25:26.800
Are the curtains drawn?

25:26.880 --> 25:28.840
-Does treason abound?
-[laughter]

25:28.920 --> 25:30.560
George, thank you so much.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.440
-Cecil, it's so good of you to come.
-Sir.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.920
-Dear Bobbety. How are you?
-Hello, sir. I'm very well.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.640
Walter, thank you so much for all this.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.640
[man]  We all know why we're here tonight.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.640
-[lighter clicks]
-To see if we can help our dear friend,

25:42.720 --> 25:47.640
His Royal Highness,
in his quest to find...

25:48.480 --> 25:51.320
A final act to this sad drama.

25:51.400 --> 25:55.080
And to turn it into a great history play.
He seeks a job.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.520
A purpose.

25:57.600 --> 26:02.200
Well, that's why I'm here.
To ask you all, my council of war,

26:02.280 --> 26:07.960
my... my  Brains Trust  of politicians,
artists and philosophers.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.680
-Something in the military, perhaps?
-[Duke] Well, why not?

26:10.760 --> 26:15.000
I was made a major-general, attached
to the British military mission in France

26:15.080 --> 26:17.040
at the beginning of the war,
in a liaising role

26:17.120 --> 26:19.440
between us and the French,
and I very much enjoyed it.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.520
Or a position within the Board of Trade.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.000
Well, what kind of position?

26:24.080 --> 26:26.560
Helping promote Britain's
economic interests abroad.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.600
-Well... Yes.
-The right man in the right position

26:31.680 --> 26:34.200
could contribute
so much to Britain's economy,

26:34.280 --> 26:37.040
helping boost our much-needed
dollar reserves.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.240
-A man with charm, contacts, influence.
-[Duke] Hmm.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.800
And the magic of being a former King.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.200
Look, doesn't it all feel
a little grubby, Walter,

26:48.280 --> 26:50.720
all those grasping
international businessmen,

26:50.800 --> 26:53.080
the whiff of profit and self-interest?

26:53.160 --> 26:57.480
No, I like the direction we were heading
earlier, the idea of a liaison post.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.680
-Then what about the diplomatic service?
-Oh, I like that idea.

27:01.760 --> 27:07.200
Don't the Americans have these unofficial
roving ambassadors nowadays?

27:07.280 --> 27:10.680
Yes, they have two in London
at the moment. Hmm.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.600
Well, something like that would be ideal.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.240
[Walter] Well, I think we have...

27:14.320 --> 27:17.320
[Duke]  "My dearest darling Peaches.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.840
What a weight is off my mind.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.600
Monckton really did come up
with the goods,

27:22.680 --> 27:26.400
and his friends really do seem
to want to help me.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.440
Now, all I must do is wait,

27:28.520 --> 27:32.320
while they discreetly make
representations on my behalf.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.560
I would say 'wait and pray,'

27:36.280 --> 27:39.440
but all taste for prayer has left me,
as I survey

27:39.520 --> 27:42.760
the madness involving
the American evangelist here.

27:42.840 --> 27:46.280
What has happened to the people
of this country,

27:46.360 --> 27:50.640
turning like lemmings to this
crusading showman from Charlotte

27:50.720 --> 27:51.960
for their inspiration?

27:53.480 --> 27:57.200
Rumor reached me that Shirley Temple
even invited the fool

27:57.280 --> 27:59.520
to preach at Windsor Chapel.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.160
Can you imagine the banality
of those exchanges?

28:03.240 --> 28:06.880
The smugness,
self-congratulation and hypocrisy.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.600
What a grotesque occasion
that must have been.

28:11.840 --> 28:15.760
Now bed calls, and for once,
as my head hits the pillow

28:15.840 --> 28:21.360
without yours beside me,
I can truthfully say, all is well.

28:21.440 --> 28:24.320
Today was a day worth living.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.560
Your loving husband, David."

28:32.040 --> 28:34.120
-[Michael] Good morning, sir.
-Primed and ready?

28:34.200 --> 28:35.640
Ready for you now, sir.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.920
I received a visit yesterday afternoon
from John Wheeler-Bennett,

28:45.560 --> 28:49.920
the senior historian in charge
of publishing the German war files,

28:50.040 --> 28:55.080
who informed me that this government
was now left with no choice

28:55.160 --> 28:56.880
but to publish certain material,

28:56.960 --> 29:00.000
which both my predecessor,
Winston Churchill,

29:00.080 --> 29:03.560
and yours, your late father,
tried to suppress.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.640
What material?

29:05.480 --> 29:07.360
The Marburg Files, ma'am.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.120
[typewriter clicks]

29:16.200 --> 29:17.320
[door closes]

29:46.320 --> 29:49.200
This was always going to come back
to haunt us.

29:54.440 --> 29:59.080
Shortly after the war ended,
some British troops...

29:59.160 --> 30:02.040
Uh... American.

30:04.800 --> 30:10.600
American troops arrested a German
soldier, as he was retreating from...

30:11.960 --> 30:16.360
Treffurt. Near Eisenach.
In central Germany.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.320
I don't remember the soldier's name.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.400
Leutnant  von Loesch.

30:23.200 --> 30:27.320
[Queen Mother] Turns out, this soldier
was Hitler's personal translator.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.960
[Michael] Uh...

30:30.320 --> 30:33.120
The assistant to Hitler's
personal translator, ma'am.

30:33.200 --> 30:37.200
Hitler's personal translator
was Dr Schmidt, Dr Paul Schmidt.

30:37.280 --> 30:40.560
All right, you tell the story, Michael.
Please.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.480
Thank you, ma'am.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.480
When his offices were being evacuated...

30:51.560 --> 30:54.400
[German soldiers chatter]

30:54.480 --> 30:59.840
[Michael]  ...Dr. Schmidt
asked his assistant, von Loesch,

30:59.920 --> 31:05.080
to dispose of all the top-secret papers,
which he had placed in archives.

31:06.640 --> 31:10.200
Von Loesch duly burnt the vast majority.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.280
[German soldiers shout at one another]

31:14.120 --> 31:18.320
But, he secretly kept
the most valuable material,

31:19.120 --> 31:24.160
hoping to use it to negotiate
his freedom and to escape trial.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.160
[birds call]

31:45.520 --> 31:46.600
-[box thuds]
-[groans]

31:48.120 --> 31:50.920
Among the papers
which von Loesch kept back,

31:51.000 --> 31:55.120
there was one file pertaining
to Anglo-German relations,

31:55.200 --> 31:58.520
in particular, the relationship
of Nazi high command

31:58.600 --> 32:01.000
with His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor.

32:03.920 --> 32:08.800
I think it's fair to say, the reality
exceeded even our worst fears.

32:10.080 --> 32:13.160
-We did everything to contain this...
-[man] That's your lot.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.880
...unaware that a copy
had been sent to the Americans...

32:16.720 --> 32:18.720
[typewriter clicks]

32:21.120 --> 32:25.040
...who are now insisting that this volume
of the Marburg Files...

32:26.520 --> 32:27.680
be published.

32:29.120 --> 32:33.080
[Queen Mother] And this is the man you
inexplicably let back into the country.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.480
I hope you have a strong stomach.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.160
[exhales]

33:27.400 --> 33:29.000
[Duke] Thank you, Joe.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.200
-Your Royal Highness.
-Foreign Secretary.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.120
-Please.
-Thank you.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.120
You have loyal
and persistent friends, sir.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.560
Oh, thank you.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.199
Following their representations and...

34:12.280 --> 34:14.880
having given the matter careful thought,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.600
it looks like we now have several options.

34:18.679 --> 34:19.920
Please.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.520
The first option I'd like you to look at
would be the role of ambassador to France.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.320
[Walter]  To a happy and...

34:38.800 --> 34:40.320
purposeful future.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.360
-Hear, hear!
-[Walter] His Royal Highness.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.480
[all] His Royal Highness!

35:08.480 --> 35:12.680
[Duke]  "My dearest darling one, I met
with the Foreign Secretary today

35:12.760 --> 35:16.520
who has managed to find three posts
where I could do something of value

35:16.600 --> 35:20.480
and importance. I am so happy.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.880
These posts would offer me the chance
to serve my country

35:23.960 --> 35:25.400
and make a difference.

35:26.240 --> 35:31.160
As to the green light, as far as
government is concerned, it's a go.

35:31.960 --> 35:36.600
Only one obstacle remains,
to get the blessing of the Crown,

35:37.680 --> 35:41.200
which involves a brief trip back
to that miserable mausoleum,

35:42.000 --> 35:43.480
Buckingham Palace.

35:48.440 --> 35:52.120
Counting down the minutes
until I am back in your arms again.

35:52.800 --> 35:58.120
-Your loving husband, David."

36:10.640 --> 36:12.880
[bell rings]

36:14.800 --> 36:15.640

36:22.160 --> 36:24.160
The Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.720
-[door closes]
-Your Majesty.

36:37.240 --> 36:41.600
-Ah, yes. It's your first time back.
-In this room, yes.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.440
That color was me, French Gray.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.360
So, to what do we owe the pleasure?

36:53.440 --> 36:56.120
I assume it's about this new book
that you're writing.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.880
Oh, actually, I've come here today
on another matter. A job.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.280
That while I'm clearly
no longer a young man,

37:05.360 --> 37:07.440
I'm also not yet an old one

37:07.520 --> 37:10.480
and might be able
to usefully serve the Crown.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.560
You had a chance to serve this country,
the greatest chance.

37:17.960 --> 37:18.960
You gave it up.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.840
Well, I gave it up because of the way
my wife was treated,

37:22.920 --> 37:25.200
not because I no longer wished
to serve this country.

37:29.200 --> 37:34.080
Anyway, one or two ideas came up.
For jobs,

37:34.160 --> 37:37.720
which would require the blessing
both of government and Crown.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.440
Of course, before coming here
and bothering you,

37:40.520 --> 37:44.080
I made sure the support
would be given by government

37:44.160 --> 37:46.440
and I've been assured of that support.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.960
Support for what jobs?

37:48.040 --> 37:50.440
Well, three possibilities came up.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.240
The first is the ambassadorship to France.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.760
The PM and Foreign Secretary
aren't keen

37:55.840 --> 37:58.240
on the incumbent, Gladwyn Jebb.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.880
And the second option?

38:01.120 --> 38:03.960
Oh, uh, as a special
liaison to the Board of Trade.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.040
The third?

38:08.080 --> 38:12.640
As, uh, High Commissioner, working with
the Commonwealth Relations Office

38:12.720 --> 38:15.600
to protect and promote British interests
throughout the world.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.840
This would suit me, I think,

38:16.920 --> 38:21.440
uh, as it specializes
in the practical side of diplomatic work.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.760
Entertaining.

38:26.800 --> 38:31.840
Well, I'm sure that you'd do
all three jobs very well indeed.

38:35.160 --> 38:38.360
But in light of what I've recently
learned about...

38:38.440 --> 38:39.680
[stutters] About what?

38:40.680 --> 38:45.320
About events that took place,
while you were in Lisbon during the war.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.320
-From whom?
-From state papers.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.840
Which state papers?

38:49.920 --> 38:51.640
German state papers...

38:53.920 --> 38:59.360
which American historians,
supported by the French and the British,

38:59.440 --> 39:01.560
are now threatening to publish.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.320
And what exactly is in these papers?

39:06.040 --> 39:08.680
Letters. And telegrams.

39:08.760 --> 39:13.600
Communications detailing your relationship
with Nazi high command.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.360
Well, it's utter nonsense.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.160
In one telegram, from 1940,

39:19.680 --> 39:23.360
it states that you were considering
publicly going against the government

39:23.440 --> 39:25.760
and pledging your support
for peace with Germany,

39:25.840 --> 39:28.040
thereby breaking with my father, the King.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.360
In another, it says that,
in return for your support,

39:31.440 --> 39:34.360
the German government
offered you a home in Spain,

39:34.440 --> 39:37.880
where you could wait out the rest
of the war in peace and safety

39:37.960 --> 39:39.960
while your countrymen gave their lives.

39:40.040 --> 39:43.080
I went to the Bahamas
as the British government instructed.

39:43.160 --> 39:47.080
Yes, you were instructed to go
to the Bahamas because of your views.

39:49.840 --> 39:55.120
In these papers, you're quoted as saying
that the Führer's desire for peace

39:55.200 --> 39:58.880
was in complete agreement
with your own point of view.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.480
[inhales, exhales]

40:07.600 --> 40:09.440
You were too young to remember.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.680
I, alas, not.

40:13.440 --> 40:17.160
Hitler and his henchmen
were once our friends.

40:17.240 --> 40:23.400
As King, I was committed to the idea,
passionately committed,

40:23.480 --> 40:26.120
that England and Germany
should never be enemies again

40:26.200 --> 40:28.600
after the horrors of the Great War.

40:28.680 --> 40:33.920
People forget, there was no indication
of who Hitler would become.

40:34.520 --> 40:38.880
You could argue that we were the ones
that made a monster of him,

40:38.960 --> 40:42.200
by refusing to be his allies.
This is the point.

40:42.920 --> 40:43.920
People make stands.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.280
They grandstand to pat themselves
on the back for their great virtue.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.440
And what is the consequence?
Another grotesque war.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.480
Millions more dead.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.040
When peace was all that mattered to me.

40:59.280 --> 41:05.000
In that spirit, I am asking you to make
peace with me today.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.360
Elizabeth, the British
are a sensible people;

41:10.440 --> 41:12.920
they will never believe
these claims against me.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.960
They will dismiss these papers
for what they are:

41:19.560 --> 41:23.680
baseless rumors and German propaganda.

41:25.520 --> 41:29.240
[bells ring in the distance]

41:42.320 --> 41:43.720
[Philip] Everything all right?

41:47.400 --> 41:51.800
-[Elizabeth] Can I ask your opinion?
-Of course. What about?

41:52.280 --> 41:54.040
[sighs] Forgiveness.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.560
Goodness. What have I done now?

41:57.440 --> 41:58.880
[Elizabeth] No, not you.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.240
Uncle David.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.760
-I think it's time that he be forgiven.
-Are you mad?

42:05.840 --> 42:08.280
-You can't forgive that man.
-Why not?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.840
What he did to this country.

42:09.920 --> 42:14.080
Those were different times.
He's explained all that to me.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.640
Mm, I bet he did.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.480
Philip.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.400
Forgiveness is very important to me.

42:22.480 --> 42:27.600
It's not often I say this, so perhaps
if I do, you will take it seriously.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.280
[sighs]

42:32.360 --> 42:35.960
[laughs] Ask Tommy Lascelles
to come and see you.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.000
-What?
-[laughs]

42:39.080 --> 42:41.160
And tell him
of your proposed course of action.

42:41.240 --> 42:44.080
-I can't keep summoning him like that.
-Why not?

42:44.880 --> 42:47.720
-Well, he's retired for one thing.
-Well, then go and see him,

42:47.800 --> 42:49.480
in an unofficial capacity.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.680
For sherry or tea.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.200
Or human blood,
whatever that monster drinks.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.320
And ask him about your uncle. He was
his private secretary while he was King.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.880
He knows everything there is to know.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.320
[car approaches in the distance]

43:19.080 --> 43:20.720
[car pulls up outside]

43:21.880 --> 43:22.880
[grunts]

43:30.920 --> 43:32.040
[door opens]

43:39.680 --> 43:43.040
-Your Majesty.
-Tommy, is it terribly inconvenient?

43:43.120 --> 43:44.680
[Tommy chuckles]

43:44.760 --> 43:46.880
-[Elizabeth hums]
-[Tommy sighs]

43:46.960 --> 43:48.120
Ah!

43:48.200 --> 43:50.720
-You're mid-battle!
-Yes, ma'am.

43:51.680 --> 43:53.480
Now, don't say anything.

43:53.720 --> 43:54.720
Ah...

43:55.280 --> 43:57.200
Yes, those uniforms...

43:57.280 --> 43:59.920
-It's 19th century?
-Yes.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.680
And that standard
is the Duke of Wellington.

44:02.760 --> 44:03.880
Very good, ma'am.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.680
So it's Waterloo.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.200
-Salamanca.
-Ah.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.680
Ah... And these?

44:12.760 --> 44:16.000
[Tommy] Troops of Sir Edward Pakenham's
Third Infantry Division.

44:16.080 --> 44:18.080
Oh, they're lovely.
Did you have them made?

44:18.920 --> 44:20.520
A gift, ma'am.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.080
From your grandfather,
when I was in his service.

44:23.560 --> 44:24.560
Hmm.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.440
-[Tommy] Shall we, ma'am?
-[Elizabeth] Yes.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.520
[exhales]

44:35.200 --> 44:39.720
I'm proposing to let the Duke of Windsor
back into public life.

44:40.880 --> 44:46.360
And, as an example of a Christian
in a Christian country, to forgive.

44:48.800 --> 44:51.400
Your Majesty,
that would... [clears throat]

44:52.320 --> 44:54.320
in my view... [sighs]

44:54.400 --> 44:55.440
be a mistake.

44:57.600 --> 44:58.680
Why?

45:00.440 --> 45:02.080
Before you make your decision, ma'am,

45:02.160 --> 45:05.360
I believe you should be
in full possession of the facts.

45:05.440 --> 45:08.920
-I've read the Marburg Files.
-So have I.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.720
I said  full  possession.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.320
-You mean there's more.
-Yes, ma'am.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.960
[Tommy]  The Duke of Windsor
made his loyalties clear

45:20.040 --> 45:21.800
as soon as he became King.

45:22.480 --> 45:26.080
Surrounded himself
with a new breed of courtier,

45:26.160 --> 45:31.000
men such as Carl,
the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, a renowned Nazi.

45:31.520 --> 45:35.440
He also shared classified Allied
documents with the Duchess of Windsor,

45:35.520 --> 45:39.400
who was herself, we believe,
sharing a bed...

45:39.480 --> 45:42.560
forgive me, ma'am...
with the German ambassador,

45:42.640 --> 45:44.280
Herr Ribbentrop.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.360
It became so bad that the government

46:02.440 --> 46:05.640
had to stop putting secret
and sensitive papers in his red box.

46:06.440 --> 46:11.160
But we needn't have worried,
because then we had the abdication.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.760
Having promised to retire
from public life,

46:17.840 --> 46:20.160
we now know that he had
no such intention.

46:20.960 --> 46:24.520
Why else would the pair of them
decide to visit Hitler in Germany?

46:24.600 --> 46:26.440
[crowd chattering]

46:31.800 --> 46:32.800
[officer]  Heil Hitler!

46:32.880 --> 46:34.080
[crowd]  Heil Hitler!

46:34.160 --> 46:38.120
[Tommy]  The Führer labeled the trip
an unofficial state visit,

46:38.200 --> 46:41.400
so it is unsurprising that it was
on that same trip,

46:41.480 --> 46:45.400
at the home of Herr Hess,
that the plan was hatched.

46:48.120 --> 46:53.240
A plan to reinstate the Duke of Windsor
as King of England...

46:54.480 --> 46:58.480
effectively betraying and dethroning
your dear late father,

46:58.560 --> 47:03.320
in return for German forces being given
free rein across Europe.

47:04.400 --> 47:10.320
German troops were even promised to
quell a colonial rebellion, if necessary.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.280
And there were visits
to SS training schools

47:13.360 --> 47:16.360
and early versions
of the concentration camps.

47:16.440 --> 47:17.320
Now, of course,

47:17.400 --> 47:20.000
the full horrors were yet to come.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.840
Nonetheless, he visited.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.880
Shall I continue, ma'am?

47:36.920 --> 47:39.480
When a German aircraft
crashed in Belgium

47:39.560 --> 47:43.000
carrying Hitler's entire military plan
for the invasion of France,

47:43.080 --> 47:47.040
the Duke wasted no time in letting
his Nazi friends know

47:47.120 --> 47:51.640
that Allied forces had, indeed,
recovered this priceless information,

47:51.720 --> 47:55.680
which gave Germany time
to change its plans.

47:55.760 --> 48:00.480
And, in less than a month,
Paris fell to German occupation.

48:01.520 --> 48:04.400
But perhaps worst of all, the Duke

48:04.480 --> 48:08.160
told the German government
that resolve in the United Kingdom

48:08.240 --> 48:10.240
in the face of the German
aerial bombardment

48:10.320 --> 48:14.240
was weakening
and that continued bombing...

48:14.320 --> 48:18.920
that is, the continued slaughter of his
fellow countrymen and former subjects,

48:19.000 --> 48:24.320
would, I quote,
"soon make Britain ready for peace."

48:31.960 --> 48:33.720
[birds chirping]

48:50.680 --> 48:53.040
[Billy on TV]  The problems of the world
can be summed up

48:53.120 --> 48:55.120
in one three-letter word:

48:55.200 --> 48:58.120
S-I-N.

48:58.200 --> 48:59.200
Sin.

49:00.680 --> 49:04.640
From Psalm 58, "The wicked
are estranged from the womb.

49:04.720 --> 49:08.960
They go astray as soon as they be born,
speaking lies."

49:09.040 --> 49:13.120
God looks deep down inside of you.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.400
God sees how you really are
down inside.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.040
Now, you may be outwardly genteel,
refined, cultured,

49:20.120 --> 49:22.800
a churchman,
of good standing in the community,

49:22.880 --> 49:25.600
but is your heart far from God?

49:31.840 --> 49:35.280
I've had a chance to think about
your request to serve your country.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.200
I was keen to help you
and, weighing it all up...

49:42.840 --> 49:48.360
the amount of time that has passed
and my affection for you, personally,

49:48.880 --> 49:50.600
all spoke in its favor.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.240
But?

49:56.800 --> 49:59.000
But, on balance...

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
I think not.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.200
And I'm sure you don't need reminding

50:06.280 --> 50:09.000
that under the terms of the agreement
reached after the abdication,

50:09.080 --> 50:12.200
you are permitted to return to
the United Kingdom only at the pleasure

50:12.280 --> 50:13.880
and invitation of the sovereign.

50:15.640 --> 50:16.640
Yes?

50:17.840 --> 50:20.800
I find myself unable to grant
that permission.

50:24.480 --> 50:28.400
And who has fed you this poison?
Your mother?

50:29.680 --> 50:30.920
No.

50:31.880 --> 50:32.920
Tommy Lascelles?

50:33.400 --> 50:36.400
-I came to my own mind.
-But you have no mind of your own.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.440
That's why everyone's so thrilled
with you.

50:39.240 --> 50:43.000
The last royal to have a mind of his own
was me and that's why they threw me out.

50:43.080 --> 50:46.280
Fine. I will go.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.920
But let me ask you this.

50:50.640 --> 50:53.000
Who has done
more damage to the monarchy?

50:53.080 --> 50:57.480
Me, with my willfulness, or you lot,
with your inhumanity?

51:02.120 --> 51:07.440
We all closed our eyes, our ears,
to what was being said about you.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.800
We dismissed it as fabrications,
as cruel chatter,

51:12.880 --> 51:15.040
in light of your decision
to give up the throne.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.200
But when the truth finally came out...

51:18.280 --> 51:19.600
The truth!

51:22.000 --> 51:25.120
It makes a mockery of even
the central tenets of Christianity.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.320
There is no possibility
of my forgiving you.

51:28.400 --> 51:33.280
The question is: how on earth
can you forgive yourself?

51:41.000 --> 51:43.680
-[bell rings]
-[door opens]

51:52.120 --> 51:53.640
[door closes]

52:02.240 --> 52:04.480
-[reporter 1] How was your trip?
-[reporter 2] Sir!

52:04.560 --> 52:07.520
-[reporter 3] How's the Duchess?
-[reporter 4] Your Royal Highness!

52:07.600 --> 52:09.720
[reporters clamoring]

52:09.800 --> 52:10.800
[reporter 5] Sir!

52:11.280 --> 52:12.320
[train whistle blows]

52:18.360 --> 52:19.920
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

52:20.040 --> 52:22.640
-[Wheeler-Bennett] Morning.
-[woman] Morning, sir.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.160
-[woman 2] Morning, sir.
-[Wheeler-Bennett] Morning.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.240
We have the go-ahead to publish.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.720
Thank you, sir.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.480
[train whistles]

53:07.160 --> 53:08.280
[door opens]

53:14.240 --> 53:15.880
[man] Reverend Graham, Your Majesty.

53:16.760 --> 53:17.760
[Billy] Your Majesty.

53:19.800 --> 53:21.320
[door closes]

53:21.400 --> 53:23.400
You're very kind to find time
for me again.

53:23.480 --> 53:24.520
[both chuckle]

53:26.640 --> 53:27.720
Oh, do sit down.

53:36.480 --> 53:37.560
[sighs]

53:37.640 --> 53:39.480
Reverend Graham, uh...

53:40.320 --> 53:42.680
I asked you here today because...

53:42.760 --> 53:47.080
there's something that I'd very much like
to hear your views on.

53:48.080 --> 53:49.160
Ma'am?

53:51.120 --> 53:52.320
Forgiveness.

53:54.880 --> 53:57.480
Are there any circumstances, do you feel,

53:57.560 --> 54:03.360
where one can be a good Christian
and yet not forgive?

54:06.600 --> 54:12.240
Christian teaching's very clear on this.
No one is beneath forgiveness.

54:12.320 --> 54:16.760
Dying on the cross, Jesus himself asked
the Lord to forgive those that killed him.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.720
Yes.

54:22.320 --> 54:26.120
But... we must remember his words.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.640
"They know not what they do."

54:30.240 --> 54:32.920
That forgiveness, it was conditional.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.920
True, but he still forgave.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.640
God himself forgives us all. Who are we
to reject the example of God?

54:42.720 --> 54:44.080
Mere mortals.

54:45.120 --> 54:50.680
We are all mortals, that is our fate,
but we need not be un-Christian ones.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.560
[Elizabeth sighs]

55:00.680 --> 55:03.920
The solution for being unable to forgive:

55:04.720 --> 55:07.880
one asks for forgiveness oneself.

55:07.960 --> 55:14.280
Humbly and sincerely, and one prays
for those that one cannot forgive.

56:26.880 --> 56:27.880
[door opens]

56:30.160 --> 56:31.440
[Philip] Saying one for me?

56:32.560 --> 56:36.120
-[Elizabeth] Not on this occasion, no.
-Go on. Put a word in.

56:36.920 --> 56:39.720
[Philip] We all know you have
the ear of the big man upstairs,

56:39.800 --> 56:42.760
-as, as head of his church.
-Oh, you're drunk.

56:42.840 --> 56:44.680
-I am. I don't deny it.
-Get off.

56:44.760 --> 56:48.640
But not nearly as drunk as either
of my drinking companions tonight.

56:48.720 --> 56:50.880
-Care to take a guess?
-I wouldn't dare.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.160
[Philip chuckles]

56:52.240 --> 56:54.600
Your de-- your de--

56:54.680 --> 56:56.760
[laughs] Your dear Ma was one.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.240
-What?!
-[Philip laughs]

56:59.320 --> 57:01.680
[Philip] And Tommy Lascelles the other.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.400
-No.
-Yes!

57:04.680 --> 57:07.120
I know. Hideous thought.

57:07.200 --> 57:11.000
But we all agreed to put aside
our historical differences

57:11.080 --> 57:13.320
to celebrate the one good thing
we all have in common.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.520
Which is?

57:15.480 --> 57:16.480
You.

57:16.560 --> 57:17.840
[sighs]

57:17.920 --> 57:24.800
And the heroic way
you kicked that wretched fool out today,

57:24.880 --> 57:26.120
tail between his legs.

57:26.200 --> 57:29.040
-It was hardly heroic.
-On the contrary, it was entirely heroic.

57:29.120 --> 57:30.880
And don't, don't for one minute

57:30.960 --> 57:33.840
start on about it being
a failure of Christianity.

57:33.920 --> 57:36.560
-Uh, it is.
-No. It's not.

57:36.640 --> 57:43.360
You protected your country and you
protected the reputation of your family.

57:45.200 --> 57:49.760
Not to mention successfully banishing
Satan from entering the Garden of Eden.

57:49.840 --> 57:52.840
That's Christ's business
in anyone's books.

57:53.760 --> 57:55.640
So, it's a gold star from Jesus.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.040
[laughs]

57:59.200 --> 58:00.800
And a gold star from me.

58:03.040 --> 58:04.520
What are you doing?

58:05.400 --> 58:06.720
-[Elizabeth laughs] No!
-Yes.

58:06.800 --> 58:09.080
-No. No, darling.
-Oh, yes, darling! Come on.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.800
[Elizabeth] No! [laughs]

58:35.560 --> 58:36.560
Ha!
