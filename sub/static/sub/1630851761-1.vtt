So it looks like what happened
is this individual

01:40.291 --> 01:42.166
broke into your home,
burglarized it,

01:42.250 --> 01:44.666
and in an apparent attempt
to escape, tripped,

01:44.750 --> 01:46.916
hit his head, and fell
into the pool and drowned.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.250

-So what is that about?

09:11.041 --> 09:14.958
So in the last three years,
I've been to five real funerals.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.000
Oh, God.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.000
The idea that people
get together and friends

09:18.083 --> 09:19.750
get together
and say wonderful things

09:19.833 --> 09:23.041
should be done to a person
who can hear it.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.666
-I love that idea.
-Yeah.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.541
ALBERT: And so it's just
a different way

09:26.625 --> 09:27.625
of thinking about it.

09:27.708 --> 09:30.791
I can't stand that all this
praise is going

09:30.875 --> 09:32.125
to somebody in a box.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.916
You can't stand that the praise
is going to somebody else.

So he was dead in the pool?

09:45.291 --> 09:47.000
Dead. Completely dead.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.666
How does the guy
get in the pool?

09:48.750 --> 09:50.041
Don't you have a fence?

It's actually a law.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.291
In Santa Monica,
you have to have a fence.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.125
All right. Can we talk
about something else?

So-- Oh, everybody, uh,
announcement to me.

10:01.791 --> 10:04.500
Mary and I are going
on a trip to Asia.

our seats picked out already

10:10.458 --> 10:11.416

-Yeah.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.958
Uh, reservations already made.

-All over that motherfucker.

10:16.875 --> 10:19.458
By the way, expensive trip, no?

10:19.541 --> 10:22.291
Fuck yeah, it was.
Had to do a little GoFundMe.

-What did you tell them?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.125

-I said I'm taking my baby...

-my baby to Asia.

a Ferrari.

Please, if you wanna send us
to Italy

from the factory...

10:54.333 --> 10:55.625
Oh, it's incredible.

10:55.708 --> 10:58.541
I got this at Dennis Zweibel's
jewelry store.

11:01.916 --> 11:04.291
The guy owes me
6,000 dollars for six months.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.166
I asked him for the money.
He got completely offended.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.916
You don't need to ask him
for money.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.166
I mean, how long
do I have to wait?

11:10.250 --> 11:11.541
Six months, a year, ten years?

a person for their money back?

You plopped down on the couch.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.583
Yeah. Well, he plopped
and then it went flying

35:03.666 --> 35:06.541
in the air and then it came out
and I couldn't find the stone.

35:06.625 --> 35:09.000
But then I remembered, you gave
me a lifetime guarantee.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.625
-So here I am.
-A what? A lifetime--

35:11.708 --> 35:14.041
A lifetime guarantee, Dennis,
you don't remember?

35:14.125 --> 35:15.833
I mean, Susie,
I don't have to remember.

35:15.916 --> 35:19.250
We don't-- We've never given
lifetime guarantees.

35:19.333 --> 35:20.958
Well, you gave me one.

35:21.041 --> 35:22.291
No, Susie, I never said that.

35:22.375 --> 35:24.458
-Yes, you did, Dennis.
-DENNIS: I didn't--

35:24.541 --> 35:25.916
Why would I say that?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.333
-I don't know why.
-That doesn't sound like
something I would say.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.541
Maybe 'cause I buy
so much fucking jewelry here.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.041
DENNIS: We appreciate that.

35:31.125 --> 35:34.083
But, Susie, I'm sorry, I just
have no memory of that. (CHOKES)

35:34.166 --> 35:35.833
Let me tell you something,
dementia boy, you gave me

35:35.916 --> 35:37.541
a lifetime guarantee,
and I don't care

35:37.625 --> 35:39.541
if you don't remember
your dog's fucking name,

35:39.625 --> 35:41.875
you're got to fix this
and it's not gonna cost me

35:41.958 --> 35:44.166
