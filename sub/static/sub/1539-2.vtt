00:01.148 --> 00:03.928
<i>There's a war coming... a terrible war.</i>

00:03.963 --> 00:06.698
<i>There will be chaos. Rivers
of blood in the streets.</i>

00:06.732 --> 00:09.354
I know it. I can see it coming.

00:09.369 --> 00:11.339
<i>MOONEY: It's time.
Somebody has to take over.</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:13.005
It might as well be me.

00:13.030 --> 00:14.873
(screams)

00:14.907 --> 00:16.674
<i>My name's James Gordon. I'm a detective.</i>

00:16.709 --> 00:18.476
<i>- My name is Bruce Wayne.
- I promise I will</i>

00:18.511 --> 00:19.677
find the man who did this.

00:19.712 --> 00:21.279
Stop or I'll shoot!

00:21.313 --> 00:22.280
(gunshot)

00:22.314 --> 00:25.183
<i>He was framed... to cover
up for the real killer.</i>

00:25.217 --> 00:27.142
I know that you own the police department.

00:27.154 --> 00:28.172
Probably the mayor.

00:28.197 --> 00:30.855
You can't have organized
crime without law and order.

00:30.890 --> 00:32.357
You snitched,

00:32.391 --> 00:34.259
my little penguin.

00:34.293 --> 00:35.894
Please!

00:35.928 --> 00:37.529
Falcone wants you to
put a bullet in his head.

00:37.563 --> 00:39.230
<i>Then everybody knows
you're with the program.</i>

00:39.265 --> 00:41.232
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

00:41.267 --> 00:43.435

(hissing softly)

01:03.589 --> 01:06.217
Ah, there you are.

01:07.185 --> 01:09.196
Been all over the bloody
house looking for you.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.733
What are you doing?

01:14.767 --> 01:16.368
Nothing.

01:16.402 --> 01:19.371
You, my old son, are a terrible liar.

01:19.405 --> 01:21.239
What have you got there?

01:23.142 --> 01:24.743
Come on. Show me.

01:29.048 --> 01:32.684
Oh, my God, you stupid little boy!

01:32.718 --> 01:35.020
Oh.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.122
It's all right. I'm sorry.

01:37.156 --> 01:39.290
It's gonna be all right.

01:42.628 --> 01:44.629
(indistinct chatter)

01:59.612 --> 02:02.147
(horn honking)

02:07.086 --> 02:09.988
Hi! I'm Patti.

02:10.021 --> 02:11.256
This is Doug.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.591
We're with the mayor's
Homeless Outreach Project.

02:13.626 --> 02:15.527
We have some sandwiches and some soup.

02:15.561 --> 02:18.163
We got cookies, got candy.
Who here likes chocolate?

02:20.299 --> 02:22.534
(chuckles) Ain't you hungry, Cat?

02:24.103 --> 02:26.004
Yeah, dig in. Take a sandwich.

02:26.038 --> 02:28.607
This is what I need. Sure, go ahead.

02:28.641 --> 02:30.542
Plenty for everyone.

02:30.576 --> 02:32.711
Yeah, sure. Take two.

02:37.316 --> 02:38.416
Hey!

02:38.451 --> 02:39.451
Hey, lady.

02:45.491 --> 02:47.459
Oh, fudge!

02:47.493 --> 02:48.560
Don't worry. I'll go.

02:48.594 --> 02:49.995
(sighs)

02:50.029 --> 02:52.030
Slow down there, buckaroo.

02:53.399 --> 02:55.367
(indistinct chatter)

02:55.401 --> 02:57.302
(grunting)

02:57.336 --> 03:00.038
(screaming)

03:43.520 --> 03:45.488
I got you one, but I dropped it.

03:45.522 --> 03:47.590
Yeah, thanks.

03:47.624 --> 03:50.359
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

03:50.394 --> 03:51.828
What do you think?

03:51.862 --> 03:54.297
I think it's been a long shift.
We give this bum three hours,

03:54.331 --> 03:56.132
then we knock off. (siren chirps)

03:56.166 --> 03:57.300
He was a vet.

03:57.334 --> 03:59.502
I salute his service. Now he's a dead bum.

03:59.536 --> 04:01.037
People are shooting bums

04:01.071 --> 04:03.773
all the time. We might as well
be looking for the tooth fairy.

04:03.807 --> 04:05.842
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bo.

04:05.876 --> 04:08.144
How come you weren't here?

04:08.178 --> 04:10.313
Whoa, whoa. Good morning to you, too.

04:10.347 --> 04:12.415
Where were you? I was at a
restaurant down the street here,

04:12.449 --> 04:15.051
Chez Vous. They had
some homeless junkie kid,

04:15.085 --> 04:17.420
fell through their front window last night.

04:17.454 --> 04:19.654
- I been taking care of that.
- This is a potential murder.

04:19.690 --> 04:21.156
You're first responder.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.159
You're supposed to preserve the
integrity of the crime scene.

04:23.193 --> 04:24.861
- He's got a point.
- Well,

04:24.895 --> 04:27.730
the restaurant that pays me $50
a month to look out for them.

04:27.764 --> 04:31.167
So I'm gonna babysit a
dead wino? I got a family.

04:31.201 --> 04:32.635
He's got a point.

04:33.737 --> 04:35.338
Why'd the kid jump through the window?

04:35.372 --> 04:36.806
Who knows? He was high.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.975
- Did you ask him?
- Why am I the bad guy here?

04:39.009 --> 04:41.911
I'm asking about the kid because
maybe he's related to the victim.

04:41.945 --> 04:44.347
And you're not a bad guy...
you're just a bad cop.

04:44.381 --> 04:45.481
Whoa. Who you talking to?

04:45.516 --> 04:46.916
- You know, I already had...
- Hold on.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.719
- Come on. Come on!
- You want it? Any day!

04:49.753 --> 04:51.621
Hey! Whoa!

04:55.392 --> 04:57.360
<i>BOY: And then Zeb and
Smoke went right down,</i>

04:57.394 --> 05:00.530
and that's when that wacky
dude just shot Soldier.

05:00.564 --> 05:02.365
That's when I realized I
needed to get out of there.

05:02.399 --> 05:03.833
So I ran and I ran, and that's how

05:03.867 --> 05:05.735
I ended up on the floor of that restaurant.

05:06.603 --> 05:07.937
She used a pin.

05:07.971 --> 05:09.939
I swear. A big pin.

05:09.973 --> 05:12.475
But, listen, this is not the first time.

05:12.509 --> 05:15.378
Street kids have been
disappearing for weeks now.

05:15.412 --> 05:17.280
By the dozen. No one knows why.

05:17.314 --> 05:19.749
- First we heard about it.
- Why-y would you?

05:19.783 --> 05:22.018
Nobody gives a crap about us.

05:22.052 --> 05:23.486
I mean, look! That is proof!

05:23.520 --> 05:26.022
That's not proof. That's
a scab. Now, listen, Macky,

05:26.056 --> 05:27.857
we're grown-ups. We're smarter than you.

05:27.891 --> 05:29.959
So you're gonna... you're
gonna tell me the truth!

05:29.993 --> 05:31.227
It was you, wasn't it?

05:31.261 --> 05:33.229
It was you that killed that poor old man.

05:33.263 --> 05:35.231
It was you. Now, you're gonna
tell me the truth, or I swear

05:35.265 --> 05:36.899
to God, I'm gonna beat it out of you!

05:36.934 --> 05:38.968
That old man was a war veteran! Listen,

05:39.002 --> 05:40.603
Cat was there. Cat saw
the whole thing. Ask Cat.

05:40.637 --> 05:41.738
- Ask Cat!
- Relax, Macky, relax.

05:41.772 --> 05:43.239
No one's gonna beat you. Who's Cat?

05:43.273 --> 05:44.474
What do you mean, no one's gonna beat him?

05:44.508 --> 05:45.842
Isn't that what I just said I was gonna do

05:45.876 --> 05:47.043
right now, just now? I was gonna beat him?

05:47.077 --> 05:48.778
GORDON: Come here! Come here. Come here.

05:50.547 --> 05:52.415
He is 16.

05:52.449 --> 05:55.585
Yeah, and six-foot,
220. He can take a punch.

05:55.619 --> 05:57.854
Look, I wasn't gonna beat him.
I just wanted to scare him.

05:57.888 --> 05:59.856
But if I did want to beat him, I could.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.858
It would be my prerogative. It's illegal.

06:01.892 --> 06:03.359
Ill...

06:03.394 --> 06:05.795
How now so righteous?

06:05.829 --> 06:08.598
Hmm? Not long since you
put a man in the river.

06:11.635 --> 06:13.603
You want to say that a little louder?

06:13.637 --> 06:15.438
Not everybody heard.

06:15.472 --> 06:17.807
Ever since then, you've been a royal
pain in the ass. You think I or anybody

06:17.841 --> 06:20.243
around here gives a
crap about a dead snitch

06:20.277 --> 06:21.544
or your guilty conscience?

06:21.578 --> 06:23.279
- We got our own problems.
- Guilty conscience,

06:23.313 --> 06:25.281
call it what you want.
I'm gonna do what's right.

06:25.315 --> 06:27.283
You're beginning to irritate me.

06:27.317 --> 06:28.618
Get your hands off me.

06:28.652 --> 06:30.453
Hey!

06:30.487 --> 06:32.889
Watch the shoes, clown.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.728
Shift's over.

06:46.136 --> 06:48.137
(rock music blaring)

06:53.877 --> 06:56.779
(laughing)

06:59.683 --> 07:01.818
(laughing)

07:01.852 --> 07:03.286
Come on.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.620
Come on.

07:04.655 --> 07:06.990
Come on. Seriously.

07:16.633 --> 07:19.068
OSWALD: Thank you so much, guys, truly.

07:19.103 --> 07:21.604
I'm very grateful. I've
been waiting for hours.

07:21.638 --> 07:24.307
No kidding. Look like you
crawled out of a cemetery.

07:24.341 --> 07:27.343
Smells like it, too.
Open a window back there.

07:28.612 --> 07:29.979
(coughing)

07:30.014 --> 07:30.980
- There you go.
- Yeah.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.281
Yes, thank you.

07:32.316 --> 07:35.051
Forgive me, I am somewhat disheveled.

07:35.085 --> 07:37.086
A temporary setback, I assure you.

07:38.122 --> 07:39.355
Thank you so much.

07:39.390 --> 07:41.457
What the hell happened to you anyhow?

07:41.492 --> 07:43.326
It was my own fault.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.528
Foolish arrogance led me astray.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.032
But I learned my lessons.

07:50.495 --> 07:54.537
I'll be back, stronger
and smarter than ever.

07:54.571 --> 07:55.838
Good luck with that, bro.

07:55.873 --> 07:58.408
Here I am riding around in a lovely truck,

07:58.442 --> 08:00.810
sharing an ice-cold
beer with my new friends.

08:00.844 --> 08:02.812
My luck's already turned, right?

08:02.846 --> 08:04.280
(chuckling)

08:04.315 --> 08:06.816
Dude, anyone ever tell you, when you walk,

08:06.850 --> 08:08.117
you look just like a penguin?

08:08.152 --> 08:10.019
(laughter)

08:10.054 --> 08:12.355
No.

08:12.389 --> 08:15.825
Nobody's ever told me that.

08:27.083 --> 08:30.188
<i>He's saying he has a right to
stop me from beating on a mope.</i>

08:30.222 --> 08:31.255
Damn right I do.

08:31.290 --> 08:32.523
How am I supposed to work with this?

08:32.558 --> 08:34.759
Look it, Jim, it's not like I can order you

08:34.793 --> 08:37.061
to break the law, but this is Gotham.

08:37.096 --> 08:39.197
You don't bend, you'll get broke.

08:39.231 --> 08:40.265
- I understand.
- I thought

08:40.299 --> 08:42.107
- you were with the program.
- He is.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.203
Well, let's get back to
work. Where are you at?

08:44.229 --> 08:46.304
Well, if the boy we have
is telling the truth,

08:46.338 --> 08:48.306
there's a couple of kidnappers out there

08:48.340 --> 08:50.742
abducting homeless children in numbers.

08:50.776 --> 08:52.644
They lured them close with a food truck

08:52.678 --> 08:54.479
from the mayor's Homeless Outreach Project.

08:54.513 --> 08:56.915
And they drugged them
with a jab from a big pin.

08:56.949 --> 08:58.583
Wh-Why would anyone want to abduct

08:58.617 --> 09:00.818
scaggly-ass orphans in bulk?

09:00.853 --> 09:01.986
I mean, where's the market?

09:02.021 --> 09:03.154
They're out on the street

09:03.188 --> 09:04.389
because no one wants them anyway.

09:04.423 --> 09:05.657
If they said they were snatching

09:05.691 --> 09:07.425
cute girls, I'd believe 'em.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.928
But what would anyone want
with a lard-ass like Macky?

09:09.962 --> 09:11.296
What is it, Ed?

09:14.466 --> 09:16.768
Guess what I found.

09:16.802 --> 09:19.137
I did a blood test on him, and he had

09:19.171 --> 09:21.139
high levels of ATP.

09:21.173 --> 09:23.441
What's ATP?

09:23.475 --> 09:25.777
It's a fast-acting knockout drug.

09:25.811 --> 09:27.679
They used to use it at
the old Arkham Asylum

09:27.713 --> 09:29.981
to bring down troublesome patients.

09:30.015 --> 09:32.217
It's hard to get. No recreational use.

09:32.251 --> 09:34.652
Okay. That's interesting.

09:34.687 --> 09:35.687
Anything else?

09:36.989 --> 09:38.690
Thank you, Ed.

09:39.925 --> 09:40.959
(clears throat)

09:41.727 --> 09:44.062
Thank you, Ed.

09:48.071 --> 09:49.038
Get to work.

09:49.072 --> 09:52.041
And keep this quiet. No press. Not a word.

09:52.075 --> 09:54.343
Shouldn't we tell the
public what's going on?

09:54.377 --> 09:56.512
- Warn them?
- Department policy.

09:56.546 --> 09:59.181
We don't advertise this
kind of stuff. Causes panic.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.984
The headlines will read
"Gotham's Kids Snatched."

10:02.018 --> 10:04.653
- Which would be true.
- No press. That's an order.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.889
Follow up on the drug, the ATP

10:06.923 --> 10:08.457
and the Arkham connection.

10:08.491 --> 10:10.292
Arkham's been closed for, like, ten years.

10:10.326 --> 10:11.427
Yeah, 15.

10:11.461 --> 10:13.762
Drug suppliers might still be in business.

10:13.797 --> 10:15.164
Oh, uh,

10:15.198 --> 10:17.166
this happened on Fish Mooney's turf.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.902
Do you want to see if it's
safe for us to go back there,

10:19.936 --> 10:21.537
or is, uh, she still mad at us?

10:21.571 --> 10:23.639
That's a good question.

10:23.673 --> 10:26.008
(playing rock music)

10:33.583 --> 10:35.317
(cheering and applause)

10:35.352 --> 10:37.653
Bravo!

10:37.687 --> 10:38.921
Bravo!

10:46.229 --> 10:47.529
Don Falcone.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.933
What a wonderful surprise. Welcome.

10:50.967 --> 10:52.267
Thank you, my dear.

10:52.302 --> 10:54.203
Can we... talk?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.268
Of course. Give me a
moment to clear the place.

10:56.269 --> 10:58.948
No, no. No need to spoil the fun.

11:13.189 --> 11:16.158
Men who are about to die are very honest.

11:16.192 --> 11:17.860
It pays to listen to them.

11:17.894 --> 11:21.030
That's some toast.

11:24.634 --> 11:27.403
I spoke with your man
Cobblepot before he died.

11:28.805 --> 11:31.240
Odd little fellow. Perceptive.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.142
He told me the death of the Waynes

11:33.176 --> 11:36.512
would bring troubled times
for our family and Gotham.

11:36.546 --> 11:39.148
(sighs) What did he know?

11:39.182 --> 11:42.284
- Business is good as ever.
- No, he was right.

11:42.319 --> 11:47.423
The Waynes and the Falcones were
the pillars of the same house.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.692
We understood each other.

11:49.726 --> 11:52.628
Now that they're gone,
everything is out of balance,

11:52.662 --> 11:55.998
and the Wayne Empire is in flux.

11:56.032 --> 11:59.301
Who knows who will end up in control?

11:59.336 --> 12:02.071
The Maroni family senses weakness.

12:02.105 --> 12:03.572
They'll start making moves,

12:03.607 --> 12:06.675
and every criminal in the
city will start making moves.

12:06.710 --> 12:09.378
Please don't lose any sleep over Maroni.

12:09.412 --> 12:11.380
He's number two for a reason.

12:11.414 --> 12:14.216
I never lose sleep over my enemies.

12:14.251 --> 12:16.952
It's my friends that keep me awake.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.555
Huh. Cobblepot told me

12:19.589 --> 12:22.591
you say I'm old and soft

12:22.626 --> 12:25.761
and ready to be taken out,
and you're the one to take me.

12:27.797 --> 12:30.666
Don Falcone, I would never,

12:30.700 --> 12:33.302
<i>ever say that.</i>

12:33.336 --> 12:36.739
I only have deep love and respect for you.

12:36.773 --> 12:40.075
You have been like a father to me.

12:40.110 --> 12:44.513
I'm so... happy to hear that.

12:44.548 --> 12:46.815
Let's forget all about it, then.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.818
The babbling of a condemned man.

12:53.123 --> 12:55.024
(clears his throat)

12:55.058 --> 12:56.759
Enough business.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.394
How have you been, my dear?

12:58.428 --> 12:59.995
Thriving, I hope.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.264
Yes. Good. I'm good.

13:02.299 --> 13:04.333
(clears his throat)

13:04.367 --> 13:07.503
Which of these is your lover?

13:07.537 --> 13:09.805
Please. My heart has been broken

13:09.840 --> 13:12.641
far too many times for that nonsense.

13:12.676 --> 13:14.443
Hmm.

13:14.478 --> 13:16.645
I heard you had a lover.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.947
Well, if you're referring

13:17.981 --> 13:20.349
to the boy that I keep
around for exercise...

13:20.383 --> 13:23.285
my lover he is not.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.821
(clears his throat) (snaps his fingers)

13:31.294 --> 13:32.461
What's your name?

13:32.496 --> 13:33.662
Lazlo, sir.

13:33.697 --> 13:36.532
Lazlo, be good to this woman.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.701
She's very precious to me.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.736
If you break her heart,

13:40.770 --> 13:42.671
you break my heart.

13:42.706 --> 13:44.373
Yes, sir.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.542
Mmm.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.812
(Lazlo groaning)

13:53.183 --> 13:55.217
Give me your hand.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.154
(blows landing, Lazlo
groaning, glass breaking)

13:58.188 --> 14:00.489
Thank you for being honest.
It means a lot to me.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.725
- (Lazlo groaning)
- It shows wisdom

14:02.759 --> 14:04.827
and humility.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.108
Out!

14:23.447 --> 14:26.348
Everyone out!

14:34.057 --> 14:37.059
WOMAN: Never, never in his life

14:37.094 --> 14:40.062
my son is away this long.

14:40.097 --> 14:43.165
Nightclubs is his business.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.934
Such hours.

14:44.968 --> 14:49.705
But always, he comes home to his mother.

14:49.740 --> 14:51.807
His clothes are here.

14:51.842 --> 14:55.578
My son would never leave his clothes.

14:55.612 --> 14:58.414
Oh, so elegant, he is.

14:58.448 --> 15:00.549
Yes, I-I show you.

15:00.584 --> 15:03.886
(whispers): Damn. Mooney and the
cops must have had him killed.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.654
Looks like the snitches get bumped.

15:05.689 --> 15:07.223
That's life.

15:07.257 --> 15:08.891
They're not going to get away with it,

15:08.925 --> 15:10.226
not as easy as they think.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.927
You take things too
personally, you know what?

15:11.962 --> 15:14.563
Yeah, I do. That was a good snitch.

15:14.598 --> 15:15.765
- What are we...?
- Nothing.

15:15.799 --> 15:18.668
- Uh, Mrs. Cobblepot...
- Kapelput.

15:18.702 --> 15:21.203
Mrs. Kapelput, do you know anyone

15:21.238 --> 15:23.506
who might want to do your son harm?

15:23.540 --> 15:25.274
Harm?

15:25.308 --> 15:28.644
No. I-I would feel it.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.946
A mother feels these things.

15:30.981 --> 15:32.848
It's a woman.

15:32.883 --> 15:37.286
Some painted slut has him in her clutch.

15:37.321 --> 15:39.422
A woman... you think?

15:39.456 --> 15:41.490
I am sure.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.593
So handsome he is.

15:44.628 --> 15:46.996
And so naive.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.666
(laughs) Who are you again?

15:50.701 --> 15:54.203
Uh, detectives with
Major Crimes Unit, ma'am.

15:54.237 --> 15:57.206
Oh, GCPD.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.042
- Like that.
- But honest.

16:00.077 --> 16:01.944
Hmm.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.981
<i>GILZEAN: Boss, don't get mad at me,</i>

16:05.015 --> 16:07.016
but I know that look.

16:09.019 --> 16:12.221
Now is too early to make a move on Falcone.

16:13.323 --> 16:15.291
I know.

16:15.325 --> 16:17.293
Not yet.

16:17.327 --> 16:21.330
I need more money, more
men, more territory, I know.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.569
I'll play this thing
loyal and bide my time.

16:28.805 --> 16:31.540
But I swear, Butch,

16:31.575 --> 16:34.243
on my sainted mother's grave,

16:34.278 --> 16:36.412
some day soon,

16:36.446 --> 16:38.614
I am going to kill that old man

16:38.649 --> 16:42.752
with my bare hands and my teeth.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.159
I'll be holding your shoes.

16:53.564 --> 16:58.100
I just wish that Penguin was still alive.

16:59.736 --> 17:02.104
I didn't make that little punk

17:02.139 --> 17:06.008
suffer near badly enough.

17:15.385 --> 17:17.286
Excuse me, sir?

17:17.320 --> 17:18.721
Uh...

17:21.391 --> 17:25.127
I couldn't help but notice
the sign on your trailer.

17:25.162 --> 17:26.561
Is it still for rent?

17:26.597 --> 17:28.464
100 bucks a week. It ain't much, but...

17:28.498 --> 17:30.800
- I'll take it.
- You don't want to look at it first?

17:30.834 --> 17:32.435
No, I'm not fussy.

17:32.469 --> 17:36.873
- It's all yours.
- The key?

17:36.907 --> 17:40.376
Hey, sweet truck. You got
that big hemi in there?

17:40.410 --> 17:43.045
Yes. Yup.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.114
That big hemi's in there.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.916
(laughs) Somewhere.

17:46.950 --> 17:49.585
(sniffles) Uh, sir, the key?

17:49.620 --> 17:51.654
It's in the door.

17:51.688 --> 17:54.056
Okay.

18:01.298 --> 18:03.332
(groans)

18:03.367 --> 18:06.936
What's up, players?

18:06.970 --> 18:08.337
You got any smokes?

18:08.372 --> 18:11.574
No.

18:16.713 --> 18:17.914
Where are we?

18:19.116 --> 18:21.083
Damn if I know.

18:21.118 --> 18:23.986
(clanking)

18:27.391 --> 18:29.292
I think we're dead.

18:40.434 --> 18:42.402
MOONEY: Harvey.

18:42.436 --> 18:44.504
Jim. How marvelous.

18:44.538 --> 18:47.273
You still mad at us?

18:47.308 --> 18:49.209
No. Please.

18:49.243 --> 18:51.344
I'm quite fond of you, and...

18:51.379 --> 18:53.647
you intrigue me.

18:53.681 --> 18:57.417
I knew I'd regret killing you
as soon as I gave the word.

18:57.451 --> 19:00.487
But you know me. I'm feisty.

19:00.521 --> 19:01.888
(laughs) What do you know about

19:01.922 --> 19:04.324
a man and a woman abducting
street kids on your turf?

19:04.358 --> 19:06.559
No foreplay with you, hmm?

19:06.594 --> 19:10.297
Figures, but you got with the program.

19:10.331 --> 19:13.166
Killed Penguin your own bad self.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.567
I was surprised.

19:14.602 --> 19:16.403
Straight arrow like you.

19:16.437 --> 19:19.239
- I guess you misjudged me.
- I guess I did.

19:19.273 --> 19:23.277
You're just a little
sinner like the rest of us.

19:23.339 --> 19:27.180
I'm almost kind of sad about that.

19:27.214 --> 19:29.649
We're looking for a man and a woman,

19:29.684 --> 19:31.351
middle-aged,

19:31.385 --> 19:34.588
white, targeting children under 16.

19:34.622 --> 19:37.490
They use a poisoned pin,
if you can believe it.

19:37.525 --> 19:41.361
Oh. Used to be there was only
a market for nice-looking girls.

19:41.395 --> 19:43.363
That's what I said.

19:43.397 --> 19:45.365
But now there's a new buyer overseas

19:45.399 --> 19:47.601
that will take anyone young and healthy.

19:47.635 --> 19:50.971
- Overseas where? Who's "they"?
- Nobody knows.

19:51.005 --> 19:53.640
- What do they want 'em for?
- Nobody knows.

19:53.674 --> 19:57.477
<i>And no one cares to know.</i>

20:03.808 --> 20:05.619
Ta-da! Moo sh...

20:05.653 --> 20:07.621
Sorry. Go on.

20:07.655 --> 20:09.356
They drug them with a big pin?

20:09.390 --> 20:10.824
That is so creepy.

20:10.858 --> 20:13.293
No, you don't want to hear
this stuff. It's depressing.

20:13.327 --> 20:15.462
What do they use them for? The children?

20:15.496 --> 20:17.731
Nobody seems to know.

20:17.765 --> 20:20.634
And we can't say a damn
thing to the press. Bad PR.

20:20.668 --> 20:22.636
I can't believe the system is so corrupt.

20:22.670 --> 20:25.405
You have no idea. What do you mean?

20:27.174 --> 20:31.011
No. You know, figure of speech, I guess.

20:31.045 --> 20:33.380
Did something happen that
you're not telling me about?

20:33.414 --> 20:35.148
These last couple of weeks...

20:35.183 --> 20:38.084
you've been different, troubled.

20:38.119 --> 20:40.387
Hmm.

20:40.421 --> 20:42.389
No.

20:42.423 --> 20:44.758
Been having trouble sleeping, I guess.

20:46.994 --> 20:49.729
The newspapers must get
anonymous tips all the time.

20:49.764 --> 20:51.731
Oh, sure, yeah.

20:51.766 --> 20:54.201
You mean, call it in myself?

20:54.235 --> 20:55.902
(laughs)

20:55.937 --> 20:57.671
No, I can't do that.

21:03.277 --> 21:04.744
(phone beeps)

21:04.779 --> 21:06.379
<i>Gotham Gazette. The newsroom.</i>

21:06.414 --> 21:08.281
Wait. No.

21:08.316 --> 21:10.016
Hi. Listen, I can't talk long.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.118
Somebody is abducting homeless
children off the streets,

21:12.153 --> 21:14.087
and the cops are trying to keep it quiet.

21:14.121 --> 21:17.090
Go talk to Captain Sarah Essen
of the GCPD. She has got a kid

21:17.124 --> 21:19.593
in custody who can tell
you the whole story.

21:19.627 --> 21:21.294
End the call. I got to go.

21:23.598 --> 21:24.898
Listen to me, Barbara.

21:24.932 --> 21:26.933
When I tell you stuff,
that's just between us.

21:26.968 --> 21:28.368
You can't do that, what you just did.

21:28.402 --> 21:29.903
But it was the right thing to do.

21:29.937 --> 21:31.805
That's not the point.
Well, what is the point?

21:33.341 --> 21:34.474
You're right.

21:34.509 --> 21:37.077
It was the right thing to do.

21:37.111 --> 21:40.547
- Don't do it again, okay?
- Yes, boss.

21:41.649 --> 21:44.484
"Gotham spirals ever downward."

21:44.519 --> 21:46.086
"Mayor James under attack."

21:46.120 --> 21:48.755
"Vows swift action." "Points finger

21:48.790 --> 21:52.325
at police department's
sluggish response." Et cetera.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.761
- It's just ink.
- Did you give them this?

21:54.796 --> 21:56.062
Me?

21:56.097 --> 21:59.266
- You've done it before.
- On my own case? Never.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.301
Be a very stupid thing to do.

22:01.335 --> 22:02.602
ESSEN: Jim?

22:03.771 --> 22:05.105
I didn't call it in.

22:06.274 --> 22:08.775
- I swear.
- Another mystery.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.477
We have a thin lead on the case,

22:10.511 --> 22:11.978
if you'd like to hear it, ma'am.

22:12.013 --> 22:13.480
There's only three companies

22:13.514 --> 22:15.282
in Gotham that stock this ATP stuff,

22:15.316 --> 22:17.651
and you need a special license to buy it.

22:17.685 --> 22:19.286
Chances are, one of the three's crooked.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.021
We're looking to lean hard on all three,

22:21.055 --> 22:24.558
like they are crooked, see which one pops.

22:34.235 --> 22:35.836
That was sneaky good.

22:35.870 --> 22:37.604
Almost couldn't tell you were lying.

22:37.638 --> 22:38.939
I wasn't lying.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.808
Good morning, Judge Baker.

22:41.843 --> 22:43.810
Thank you, sir. Yes, all three.

22:43.845 --> 22:45.011
Welzyne,

22:45.046 --> 22:47.481
Dracotech and Quillan Pharma.

22:52.253 --> 22:54.988
<i>MAN: You guys have screwed me.</i>

22:55.023 --> 22:56.990
Against my better judgment,

22:57.025 --> 22:58.658
I sell you the juice,

22:58.693 --> 23:01.228
I let you guys use my storage space

23:01.262 --> 23:03.897
because, "No problem," you said.

23:03.931 --> 23:06.900
And now look. Heat.

23:06.934 --> 23:08.335
White-hot heat.

23:08.369 --> 23:10.237
No problems, my friend.

23:10.271 --> 23:11.905
We're here to take the merch away.

23:11.939 --> 23:13.640
You'll be clean as a whistle.

23:13.675 --> 23:15.609
Merch?

23:15.643 --> 23:17.177
They're children, damn it.

23:17.211 --> 23:19.212
They're human beings.

23:19.247 --> 23:21.381
Didn't I tell you to check
on them ten minutes ago?

23:24.385 --> 23:26.553
I want another five large.

23:26.587 --> 23:28.021
But we had a deal already.

23:28.056 --> 23:30.057
I got to stand up for what is right here.

23:30.091 --> 23:33.026
Be fair, sir. We don't have
that kind of cash on hand.

23:33.061 --> 23:35.362
That's your problem. I can wait.

23:35.396 --> 23:37.397
I thought you was worried about the heat.

23:37.432 --> 23:39.366
Well, if heat arrives in the meantime,

23:39.400 --> 23:42.102
I can get rid of the evidence very quickly.

23:42.136 --> 23:43.704
We have an obligation to deliver.

23:43.738 --> 23:46.006
The Dollmaker doesn't tolerate failure.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.942
- We need those children.
- Well, that's also your problem.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.213
(groans)

23:55.483 --> 23:59.219
No. Hey, hey, this is
totally inappropriate.

23:59.253 --> 24:01.888
I mean, we were having a
business discussion here.

24:01.923 --> 24:03.624
You weren't being fair.

24:07.962 --> 24:10.263
Oh, gosh. Cops.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.102
<i>You didn't call the
Gazette, but did your girl</i>

24:15.136 --> 24:17.070
<i>call the Gazette? Yeah.</i>

24:17.105 --> 24:19.640
- I knew it.
- I didn't know she was gonna call 'em.

24:19.674 --> 24:21.775
Seriously, you got to
learn to control your woman.

24:21.809 --> 24:23.577
I kind of like her the way she is.

24:23.611 --> 24:25.112
No, these high-class
temperamental broads...

24:25.146 --> 24:26.980
they need firm handling. Trust me.

24:27.015 --> 24:29.316
- Trust you? On women?
- Damn right.

24:29.350 --> 24:31.718
All varieties. From
hausfraus to movie stars.

24:31.753 --> 24:35.088
I love 'em all. Now, you? Let me guess.

24:35.123 --> 24:37.491
High school sweetheart.
Then a bunch of hos overseas

24:37.525 --> 24:39.259
only made you sad,

24:39.294 --> 24:40.827
and then there's Barbara.

24:40.862 --> 24:42.296
Pretty much.

24:42.330 --> 24:44.965
You, my friend, are a monkey

24:44.999 --> 24:46.466
riding a racehorse.

24:55.510 --> 24:57.110
Good evening. May I help you?

24:57.145 --> 24:58.912
Detectives Gordon and
Bullock. We need to speak

24:58.947 --> 25:00.948
- to whoever's in charge here, ma'am.
- Of course.

25:00.982 --> 25:03.584
Mr. Quillan, detectives
are here to see you.

25:03.618 --> 25:04.985
Oh?

25:06.454 --> 25:08.155
Oh, wow. (short laugh)

25:08.189 --> 25:09.923
Detectives. Hey, what's up?

25:09.958 --> 25:11.458
Nothing serious, I hope.

25:11.492 --> 25:14.228
Cut the crap. We have a
warrant to search the premises.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.529
We know what you're doing.

25:15.563 --> 25:17.464
Well, then, you know
some boring stuff, then.

25:17.498 --> 25:19.166
I mean, what are you talking about?

25:20.301 --> 25:22.369
You're peddling ATP to those kid snatchers.

25:22.403 --> 25:24.538
Oh, my gosh, no. I-I mean,

25:24.572 --> 25:27.007
we used to stock ATP, but not since

25:27.041 --> 25:29.176
the Arkham Asylum closed.

25:29.210 --> 25:32.145
Uh, uh... I heard that the Wayne Foundation

25:32.180 --> 25:34.147
is planning on reopening

25:34.182 --> 25:35.883
the old place again.

25:35.917 --> 25:37.384
But now that the Waynes are dead,

25:37.418 --> 25:39.319
I guess everything's up in the air.

25:39.354 --> 25:40.821
Uh...

25:40.855 --> 25:42.322
what a world, eh?

25:42.357 --> 25:44.057
Nobody's safe.

25:56.204 --> 25:57.571
(click)

25:57.605 --> 25:59.806
Jim! Go, go!

25:59.841 --> 26:02.576
(tires screech, engine revs)

26:08.216 --> 26:10.050
(gasps)

26:11.886 --> 26:13.654
Where the hell were you?

26:13.688 --> 26:15.322
Get rid of 'em now.

26:15.356 --> 26:17.558
And hose down the room.

26:29.571 --> 26:30.737
Zeb.

26:31.639 --> 26:32.873
Freeze.

26:33.808 --> 26:36.076
(grunts)

26:36.110 --> 26:39.246
(echoing scream)

26:48.721 --> 26:50.836
On behalf of all the citizens of Gotham,

26:50.870 --> 26:52.237
I want to thank you brave gentlemen

26:52.271 --> 26:55.340
from the bottom of my heart,
and I want to promise you kids...

26:55.375 --> 26:57.442
we will take care of you

26:57.477 --> 26:59.811
as if you were our own children.

26:59.846 --> 27:01.513
But here's the thing.

27:01.547 --> 27:05.217
The people who victimized
these kids are still out there.

27:05.251 --> 27:07.819
And hundreds of vulnerable youngsters

27:07.854 --> 27:10.022
are still living rough on our streets.

27:10.056 --> 27:13.191
<i>Alone, unprotected,</i>

27:13.226 --> 27:14.493
<i>and let's face it,</i>

27:14.527 --> 27:17.362
<i>that's the real crime here. So what are we</i>

27:17.397 --> 27:19.164
going to do to help these kids?

27:19.198 --> 27:22.067
<i>Yesterday I made a phone call</i>

27:22.101 --> 27:24.703
<i>to Juvenile Services and the GCPD</i>

27:24.737 --> 27:27.372
<i>to initiate a humane
but tough-love program</i>

27:27.407 --> 27:30.409
<i>to get these kids off the streets</i>

27:30.443 --> 27:31.910
and into the loving arms

27:31.944 --> 27:33.779
of Juvenile Services.

27:37.450 --> 27:40.352
- I think that went very well.
- I think so.

27:40.386 --> 27:42.721
A small toast, Your Honor?

27:42.755 --> 27:43.889
You read my mind.

27:43.923 --> 27:46.024
Mr. Mayor.

27:46.059 --> 27:47.559
Uh, where are you sending

27:47.593 --> 27:49.294
all the children that get rounded up?

27:49.329 --> 27:52.097
Foster homes for the cute, undamaged ones.

27:52.131 --> 27:54.900
- Upstate for the rest.
- Upstate?

27:54.934 --> 27:57.035
The Alpena Youth Corrections Facility.

27:57.070 --> 27:58.370
A fine institute.

27:58.404 --> 28:00.105
Prison, in other words.

28:00.139 --> 28:02.341
Forgive me, Your Honor.

28:02.375 --> 28:04.409
Detective Gordon's our house firebrand.

28:04.444 --> 28:05.877
No, no, no, th-that's okay.

28:05.912 --> 28:08.246
Jim... May I call you Jim?

28:09.549 --> 28:11.583
Half the petty crime in the city

28:11.618 --> 28:14.853
is homeless kids. They need structure.

28:14.887 --> 28:16.488
People who care for them.

28:16.522 --> 28:19.424
For the greater good of Gotham
and for the children. You see?

28:19.459 --> 28:21.660
I see you're using the child snatchers

28:21.694 --> 28:23.795
as a pretext to lock up children

28:23.830 --> 28:25.631
without a trial.

28:27.533 --> 28:29.835
Thank you, my friend.

28:29.869 --> 28:31.570
Valuable input.

28:31.604 --> 28:33.472
Most refreshing.

28:33.506 --> 28:34.906
<i>L'chaim.</i>

28:37.644 --> 28:40.145
- (indistinct chatter)
- Yo, Gordon.

28:40.179 --> 28:42.180
Man's been waiting for you upstairs.

28:48.855 --> 28:50.322
Mr. Pennyworth.

28:50.356 --> 28:53.492
Alfred, please.

28:53.526 --> 28:54.826
It's bedlam, isn't it?

28:54.861 --> 28:56.862
Rough job you got.

28:58.698 --> 28:59.998
Best job in the world.

29:01.301 --> 29:03.268
I wonder if it might be convenient

29:03.303 --> 29:05.637
for you to visit us tomorrow.

29:05.672 --> 29:07.005
Of course.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.708
- Why? Is something wrong?
- I don't know.

29:09.742 --> 29:12.511
Never had a child before.

29:12.545 --> 29:13.845
Nor me.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.781
The boy respects you.

29:17.183 --> 29:19.685
Teatime, shall we say?

29:20.887 --> 29:22.888
Teatime.

29:27.927 --> 29:30.929
(heavy metal playing over earbuds)

29:44.277 --> 29:46.278
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

29:49.816 --> 29:51.183
Name.

29:51.217 --> 29:53.485
Ma'am, there's been a mistake.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.087
I'm not meant to go upstate. I need to talk

29:55.121 --> 29:56.488
to James Gordon. He's a cop.

29:56.523 --> 29:58.457
You'll be allowed a phone
call when you get upstate.

29:58.491 --> 30:00.926
Name. I need to talk to him now.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.662
- He'll thank you for it.
- Not happening. Name.

30:03.696 --> 30:05.164
Bite me, pigarina.

30:05.198 --> 30:07.366
Jane Doe.

30:28.955 --> 30:30.322
Hey.

30:30.356 --> 30:32.758
Relax, kid. Juvie's not so bad.

30:32.792 --> 30:36.061
First week, whatever you do,

30:36.095 --> 30:38.897
don't make friends with
anyone that's friendly.

30:38.932 --> 30:41.567
When you get into a
fight, go for their eyes.

30:42.802 --> 30:44.937
Hiya, kids. How you doing?

30:44.971 --> 30:47.406
Are you ready to go on a big adventure?

30:49.275 --> 30:50.375
Sit down, young lady.

30:50.410 --> 30:54.246
I said sit down.

30:55.348 --> 30:57.316
Like now.

31:03.123 --> 31:04.723
Okay.

31:04.758 --> 31:07.593
Next naughty child to stand up

31:07.627 --> 31:10.796
gets a black mark right here.

31:10.830 --> 31:12.131
(engine starts)

31:22.752 --> 31:26.273
One or two or three...
I could explain that.

31:26.307 --> 31:27.441
But a busload...

31:27.475 --> 31:29.710
a whole busload of the little bastards...

31:29.744 --> 31:31.011
what am I supposed to say?

31:31.045 --> 31:33.714
Oops? Just tell me it
wasn't them, I'm begging you.

31:33.748 --> 31:35.749
Just tell me it wasn't the snatchers.

31:35.783 --> 31:38.719
Bus driver was a man, guard was a woman.

31:38.753 --> 31:40.020
It could be them.

31:40.054 --> 31:42.890
You're killing me. You're killing me.

31:42.924 --> 31:44.892
We're working it, Your Honor.

31:44.926 --> 31:47.194
(groaning)

31:47.228 --> 31:49.596
Look, I told you everything
I know. I told you.

31:49.631 --> 31:50.864
Now, you see that man there?

31:50.899 --> 31:52.800
He doesn't like it when I
beat people, but for you,

31:52.834 --> 31:55.202
he's got no objection. Why is that?

31:55.236 --> 31:58.572
Math. Thlives of 30
children versus one scumbag.

31:58.606 --> 32:00.440
So I can beat you like a bongo drum

32:00.475 --> 32:01.909
and Saint Jim here won't intervene.

32:01.943 --> 32:03.143
Give us something.

32:03.178 --> 32:05.445
Okay, okay, look...

32:05.480 --> 32:07.281
The truck. You know, when they came to

32:07.315 --> 32:08.816
pick up the last bunch of kids.

32:08.850 --> 32:10.884
On the side of it, there was a-a picture.

32:10.919 --> 32:13.287
Like a logo. I-I didn't want to say before

32:13.321 --> 32:14.788
because it would give a bad impression.

32:14.823 --> 32:16.757
See, it doesn't reflect,
really, what, you know...

32:16.791 --> 32:18.225
- What was it?
- It has a...

32:18.259 --> 32:20.994
a blue plate and a silver fork.

32:21.029 --> 32:24.665
- A plate and a fork?
- Yeah, you know, like, with the...

32:24.699 --> 32:26.400
Like a catering company? Like
food? Well, yeah, like that,

32:26.434 --> 32:28.268
I mean, you know, but, I mean, that

32:28.303 --> 32:31.438
- doesn't mean... You know.
- Doesn't mean what?

32:31.473 --> 32:33.607
Look, I don't know what
they do to them. Aah!

32:33.641 --> 32:35.909
Hey. Hey.

32:35.944 --> 32:39.613
All right, draw the logo. Uncuff him.

32:46.387 --> 32:48.655
There you go, kids.

32:48.690 --> 32:50.991
Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be all right.

32:51.025 --> 32:52.459
That's right. That's right. Come on.

32:52.494 --> 32:54.428
Come on, come on, come
on, come on. Come on!

32:54.462 --> 32:56.997
Go.

33:00.568 --> 33:02.369
Funny thing. By my count,

33:02.404 --> 33:04.805
according to the sheet they
gave us, we're one short.

33:04.839 --> 33:08.108
Me, too. Maybe there's one on the bus. Hmm.

33:09.878 --> 33:11.945
(children gasping, whimpering)

33:11.980 --> 33:13.113
Shh!

34:00.996 --> 34:03.364
Nope. Weird.

34:03.398 --> 34:04.965
Must be a miscount someplace.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.700
Never mind. We got more than enough.

34:06.735 --> 34:07.735
We did good.

34:07.769 --> 34:09.503
Indeed we did. (laughs)

34:09.536 --> 34:12.339
The Dollmaker will be so pleased with us.

34:12.373 --> 34:14.742
All right, thanks. Nothing. You?

34:14.775 --> 34:16.744
Apparently, there are no companies

34:16.777 --> 34:19.580
in Gotham with trucks with a
plate and a fork as their logo.

34:19.614 --> 34:21.581
Selling children for food?

34:21.616 --> 34:23.684
Is such a thing even possible?

34:24.985 --> 34:27.121
We've got officers searching all the trucks

34:27.155 --> 34:28.621
on every bridge and tunnel.

34:28.657 --> 34:30.958
But they had a three-hour window.

34:30.992 --> 34:33.027
We can only pray they stayed in the city.

34:33.061 --> 34:36.063
If not, they could be any
place on Earth by nightfall.

34:36.097 --> 34:37.630
BULLOCK: Scum-sucking
toads. Where are they?!

34:41.402 --> 34:43.203
It's not a blue plate.

34:43.237 --> 34:45.472
It's not a fork, either. It's a trident.

34:46.507 --> 34:48.708
PATTI: When you stow this on the ship,

34:48.743 --> 34:51.277
make sure there's plenty of
room for the doors to open.

34:51.313 --> 34:52.446
The ship's crew has...

34:52.480 --> 34:53.880
- (loud knocking)
- Let me out!

34:53.915 --> 34:55.315
(indistinct shouting of children)

34:55.350 --> 34:58.385
Quiet in there!

34:58.420 --> 34:59.920
(indistinct shout of man)

34:59.955 --> 35:01.388
(coughing)

35:01.423 --> 35:03.223
- (whimpering)
- Hush.

35:03.258 --> 35:05.059
Hush.

35:05.093 --> 35:06.393
(crying)

35:06.428 --> 35:07.962
My eyes! She scratched me!

35:07.996 --> 35:09.129
Oh!

35:09.164 --> 35:10.297
DOUG: Come on, follow me.

35:10.332 --> 35:12.533
(man whimpering)

35:12.567 --> 35:14.568
Mmm. Let me look.

35:15.637 --> 35:17.605
Hmm. Yeah.

35:17.639 --> 35:19.440
It's nothing. It's a scratch.

35:19.474 --> 35:20.908
We'll get you to the doctor,

35:20.942 --> 35:22.810
you'll be right as rain in no time.

35:22.844 --> 35:25.279
You sure?

35:25.313 --> 35:26.680
(click)

35:26.715 --> 35:28.582
What was that? Hang on.

35:30.518 --> 35:33.187
(children screaming)

36:15.764 --> 36:16.830
Well...

36:18.533 --> 36:20.901
You are a very naughty little girl.

36:20.936 --> 36:22.469
(cocks gun)

36:28.009 --> 36:30.878
Hi. What's your name?

36:30.912 --> 36:32.646
Why is that your business?

36:34.850 --> 36:37.218
Jim!

36:41.089 --> 36:43.190
Where are the kids?

36:44.559 --> 36:45.860
Where are they?!

36:50.149 --> 36:51.862
He's not been sleeping.

36:53.413 --> 36:56.047
And when he does, he has these nightmares.

36:56.081 --> 36:58.116
Now he's hurting himself.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.118
Burning himself.

37:00.152 --> 37:01.886
He's cutting.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.021
Is he getting professional help?

37:04.056 --> 37:05.623
Oh, you mean a psychiatrist?

37:05.657 --> 37:07.959
No, no, he won't have 'em.

37:07.993 --> 37:11.462
No psychiatrists. That's a rule.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.160
You make the rules, don't
you? You're his guardian.

37:14.210 --> 37:18.803
Bruce's father gave me
very firm orders was him

37:18.837 --> 37:20.438
and his missus to die.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.806
Now, I will raise

37:21.840 --> 37:24.208
the boy the way his father
told me to raise him.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.111
Which is how?

37:27.146 --> 37:31.449
Trust him to choose his own course.

37:31.483 --> 37:35.119
He's, after all, a Wayne.

37:35.154 --> 37:38.256
Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.259
What do you want me to do?

37:41.294 --> 37:42.927
He wants you to talk some sense into me.

37:44.230 --> 37:46.064
Haven't I told you to stop creeping up

37:46.098 --> 37:47.832
on people like that
before? It's bloody rude!

37:49.769 --> 37:52.304
All right, then, Bruce.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.539
Talk to me.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.174
I'm perfectly fine.

37:56.208 --> 37:58.009
Alfred's a worrywart.

37:59.045 --> 38:00.912
What did you do to your hand?

38:03.616 --> 38:05.583
I burned it.

38:05.618 --> 38:07.619
Listen to me, Bruce.

38:08.921 --> 38:10.922
You've been through a terrible experience.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.359
Talking to someone can be very helpful.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.595
You must have seen
terrible things in the war.

38:16.629 --> 38:19.731
<i>Does it... does it help you
to talk about what you saw?</i>

38:21.067 --> 38:23.034
Yes. A little.

38:23.069 --> 38:25.537
You're not a very good liar.

38:25.571 --> 38:29.474
- Bruce, you're hurting yourself.
- I'm testing myself.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.010
Different, but I appreciate your concern.

38:37.817 --> 38:40.819
I've been following your
adventures in the newspapers.

38:40.853 --> 38:44.089
I feel very sorry for
all those poor children.

38:44.123 --> 38:46.124
Me, too.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.827
I'll give you some money to give to them.

38:48.861 --> 38:50.795
I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, Bruce.

38:50.830 --> 38:53.331
What way does it work?

38:53.366 --> 38:55.433
Those children need
someone who cares for them,

38:55.468 --> 38:58.670
like you have right here.

39:00.006 --> 39:02.240
Money won't buy that.

39:02.275 --> 39:04.943
There must be something I can do.

39:04.977 --> 39:07.579
What about clothes?

39:07.613 --> 39:09.681
They all looked awfully ragged.

39:11.284 --> 39:13.351
They did, didn't they?

39:17.156 --> 39:19.191
(indistinct voice over
P.A., phones ringing)

39:19.225 --> 39:21.193
After all this?

39:21.227 --> 39:23.195
- You're sending us upstate?
- Selina...

39:23.229 --> 39:25.764
Cat.

39:25.798 --> 39:29.434
Cat, even if you didn't have
outstanding warrants, you're 13.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.436
No parents or guardians.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.638
That's not true. I have a mom.

39:33.673 --> 39:36.007
- Says here she's deceased.
- That's not true.

39:36.042 --> 39:39.845
- She's alive... someplace.
- Be that as it may,

39:39.879 --> 39:42.480
we're not allowed to put
you back on the street.

39:42.515 --> 39:45.550
- It's for your own well-being.
- (laughs)

39:45.585 --> 39:47.285
Have you been there? Upstate?

39:47.320 --> 39:48.987
- Yes.
- Then you know.

39:49.021 --> 39:50.822
You know.

39:52.158 --> 39:54.125
Go get Detective James Gordon.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.861
He works here.

39:55.895 --> 39:58.029
Cat...

39:58.064 --> 40:00.832
the police are very busy people.

40:00.867 --> 40:02.834
- (mutters)
- Go get him...

40:02.869 --> 40:04.836
or...

40:04.871 --> 40:06.738
I'll say you touched me.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.007
Excuse me?

40:09.041 --> 40:11.009
James Gordon.

40:11.043 --> 40:13.311
I'm gonna scream in about three seconds.

40:23.723 --> 40:26.258
(rain falling, thunder rumbling)

40:35.134 --> 40:37.169
(cell phone ringing)

40:40.573 --> 40:42.541
Hello.

40:42.575 --> 40:45.877
Yes, this is he.

40:45.912 --> 40:48.547
Well... I'm looking at your son

40:48.581 --> 40:50.348
right now, and...

40:50.383 --> 40:52.384
he doesn't look good.

40:53.820 --> 40:56.721
Madam, I assure you, your son
is not trying to trick you.

40:56.756 --> 41:00.459
Oh, he will die a
horrible death unless he...

41:00.493 --> 41:04.729
No, no. No, really truly, he isn't joking.

41:04.764 --> 41:06.732
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

41:06.766 --> 41:10.435
I will poke his eyeballs out, and...

41:10.470 --> 41:13.138
How can you say that?
You saw the video I sent.

41:13.172 --> 41:14.606
I'm not lying. (laughs)

41:14.640 --> 41:18.043
Madam, Madam, c-calm yourself.

41:18.077 --> 41:21.113
If $10,000 is too much, I'm sure we can...

41:21.147 --> 41:23.615
Hello? Hello?

41:29.322 --> 41:31.456
Well, that's disappointing.

41:33.126 --> 41:35.293
She didn't believe me.

41:35.328 --> 41:37.396
(whimpering)

41:38.431 --> 41:40.632
You must be quite the scamp.

41:45.271 --> 41:47.272
I got it.

41:47.306 --> 41:49.274
Hello again, young lady.

41:49.308 --> 41:52.310
- How can I help you?
- We need to talk.

41:52.345 --> 41:54.813
So, now you want to talk, huh?

41:54.847 --> 41:57.482
Okay. It's all right.

41:57.517 --> 41:58.917
Thanks.

42:00.720 --> 42:03.088
- Selina is it?
- Cat.

42:03.122 --> 42:05.090
Cat.

42:05.124 --> 42:06.525
You Macky's friend?

42:07.560 --> 42:08.994
Yeah, I know Macky.

42:09.028 --> 42:12.464
Those bastards nearly got you twice, huh?

42:12.498 --> 42:14.666
You're quite a survivor.

42:14.701 --> 42:16.968
You have no idea.

42:22.075 --> 42:24.042
Suppose I had something

42:24.077 --> 42:26.678
you really, really wanted.

42:26.713 --> 42:28.981
If I gave it to you,

42:29.015 --> 42:30.716
could you get me out of here?

42:30.750 --> 42:32.017
What do you got?

42:32.051 --> 42:33.819
I've been watching you.

42:34.854 --> 42:36.321
You're a friend of the boy.

42:36.356 --> 42:38.323
You're not like the rest of these crooks.

42:44.664 --> 42:47.733
The boy? Bruce?

42:49.335 --> 42:51.203
What do you mean, you've been watching me?

42:51.237 --> 42:53.972
That Mario Pepper guy was a patsy, huh?

42:54.007 --> 42:56.341
What makes you say that?

42:56.376 --> 42:58.577
Could you? Could you get me out?

42:59.612 --> 43:01.580
It's possible.

43:04.717 --> 43:07.152
I saw who really killed the Waynes.

43:07.186 --> 43:09.442
Saw him clear as day.
