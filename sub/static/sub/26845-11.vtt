00:04.498 --> 00:06.456
( music playing )

00:31.498 --> 00:34.082
Girl on TV:
Hey, Natalie,
what's the problem?

00:34.165 --> 00:37.332
Girl 2:
No problem, if my test
was on Kool & the Gang.

00:37.414 --> 00:38.790
( laugh track )

00:38.873 --> 00:41.248
If you're referring
to my singing,

00:41.332 --> 00:43.082
it helps me think.

00:43.165 --> 00:45.332
If you don't put
that thing away,

00:45.414 --> 00:47.082
I'm gonna sit on your neck!

00:47.165 --> 00:49.831
( laugh track )

00:55.539 --> 00:57.706
( water running in shower )

01:07.539 --> 01:09.165
Girl 1:
I hate that hat.

01:09.248 --> 01:11.956
( shower turns off )

01:12.040 --> 01:14.248
Girl 2:
This is my exam hat.

01:14.332 --> 01:18.248
I wear it twice a year,
every year. She knows that.

01:18.332 --> 01:20.123
( door opens )

01:20.207 --> 01:23.748
That is some motherfuckin'
water pressure right there, man.

01:23.831 --> 01:27.706
That is some...
Zestfully clean shit
right there.

01:29.248 --> 01:30.915
( TV continues playing )

01:33.664 --> 01:35.581
What you watchin'?

01:35.664 --> 01:38.498
- I don't know.
- What's it about?

01:38.581 --> 01:40.748
I'm not sure.

01:43.165 --> 01:45.664
Is it good?

01:45.748 --> 01:47.040
Yeah.

01:49.248 --> 01:51.082
Is it this good?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.414
Ollie. Knock knock.

01:56.498 --> 01:57.539
Crack attack!

01:59.748 --> 02:01.581
( laughs )

02:03.123 --> 02:05.623
Yeah. Keep you on your toes,
man.

02:18.790 --> 02:22.123
( paper bag rustling )

02:38.539 --> 02:40.456
( TV continues )

02:49.581 --> 02:51.664
( drops cube in glass )

02:51.748 --> 02:54.498
( pours liquor )

03:02.581 --> 03:04.998
Little bit of heaven
right there, man.

03:10.082 --> 03:11.290
( clears throat )

03:16.498 --> 03:18.332
( clears throat )

03:18.414 --> 03:20.539
Man on TV:
Heavy words
from the Soviet leaders...

03:20.623 --> 03:25.332
All right, Ollie, m'boy...
let's see how we did tonight.

03:27.998 --> 03:31.290
Still can't believe
that motherfucker Larry dude

03:31.373 --> 03:34.956
comin' up in there with them
dinosaur-lookin' motherfuckin'

03:35.040 --> 03:37.956
yellow-assed crusty toenails
pokin' through his sandals
like that.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.290
Who the fuck
he think he is,

03:39.373 --> 03:41.831
disrespectin' a place
like that?

03:41.915 --> 03:44.456
I swear, man,
every now and then

03:44.539 --> 03:46.831
I start to feel sorry
for one of these stupid
motherfuckers

03:46.915 --> 03:49.956
we put the hustle on,
and then I meet somebody
like Toenail Larry,

03:50.040 --> 03:51.790
disrespecting the joint.

03:51.873 --> 03:54.414
Make me want to drop a pool cue
right through his fuckin'

03:54.498 --> 03:56.332
dirty-ass, fucked up foot.

03:56.414 --> 03:59.623
Should've took his dumb ass
for everything he's worth.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.748
- I thought we did.
- Huh?

04:02.831 --> 04:05.498
I thought we did take him
for everything. Didn't we?

04:05.581 --> 04:07.373
Yeah, his cash,
we got him for all his cash,

04:07.456 --> 04:10.831
but I mean like his--
his fuckin' house.

04:10.915 --> 04:12.498
His car or some shit like that.

04:12.581 --> 04:16.165
Be nice for us to have
our own car at some point,

04:16.248 --> 04:21.207
instead of ridin' around
in fuckin' buses all the time.

04:21.290 --> 04:23.290
You know what I'm sayin'?

04:23.373 --> 04:24.790
Mmm.

04:27.290 --> 04:29.831
All right. Here ya go.

04:29.915 --> 04:34.082
Took out 14 for the room.
That leaves, uh, 47 for you.

04:35.539 --> 04:36.831
What else is on?

04:36.915 --> 04:38.165
Man on TV:
Everyone in the community

04:38.248 --> 04:39.748
is still in a bit of a shock...

04:39.831 --> 04:43.290
We only made $47?

04:43.373 --> 04:47.248
No, 94 total.
I took out 14
for the room.

04:47.332 --> 04:49.873
That's 47 for you, 47 for me.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.748
Man, I played a lot tonight.

04:52.831 --> 04:55.165
Yeah, I know, I was there.

04:55.248 --> 04:57.790
I was settin' that shit up.

04:57.873 --> 04:59.748
I know, it's just...

05:01.207 --> 05:02.956
It's just what, Ollie?

05:05.040 --> 05:07.873
We used to make more money
than this.

05:07.956 --> 05:08.915
( sighs )

05:08.998 --> 05:12.456
Yeah. We did. Sometimes.

05:12.539 --> 05:14.915
In the bigger cities
with the bigger halls,
bigger idiots,

05:14.998 --> 05:17.456
bigger wallets--
yeah, sometimes we did.

05:17.539 --> 05:20.623
But we played those places out
already, so now we gotta
hustle more.

05:20.706 --> 05:23.706
Smaller venues,
smaller paydays.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.373
Just the way it is right now.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.915
It's just,
don't make sense, man.

05:29.998 --> 05:33.915
What don't make sense
to you, Ollie?

05:33.998 --> 05:38.998
Seems to me a person
gets better at a job
as he goes along, right?

05:39.082 --> 05:42.165
Works more years at it,
gets better at it.

05:42.248 --> 05:44.748
The pay should be going up
instead of down.

05:44.831 --> 05:47.998
We been on the road
four years now,

05:48.082 --> 05:50.998
we makin' $47 a night?

05:51.082 --> 05:53.207
At this point?

05:53.290 --> 05:55.290
Shit don't make sense, Franco.

05:59.498 --> 06:02.998
Look at you, Ollie.
( laughs )

06:03.082 --> 06:07.082
You got a motherfuckin'
business mind up here
after all.

06:07.165 --> 06:09.082
( Franco laughs )

06:09.165 --> 06:12.873
I agree with you.
Does seem kind of wrong.

06:12.956 --> 06:16.623
They call the kind of shit
we doin' a race to the bottom.

06:16.706 --> 06:18.706
The harder we work,

06:18.790 --> 06:22.456
the more people out there
realize that you
are a real player

06:22.539 --> 06:24.623
and I'm a real hustler.

06:24.706 --> 06:26.373
So we start makin' less and less

06:26.456 --> 06:28.165
'cause nobody out there
wants to play us.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.414
But it's gonna be all good...

06:34.498 --> 06:37.373
because I got a plan, my cuz.

06:37.456 --> 06:39.456
My cuz-cuz cousin.

06:39.539 --> 06:42.123
I got a motherfuckin'
master plan.

06:42.207 --> 06:45.248
Like I always do.
( laughs )

06:45.332 --> 06:48.207
Always lookin' out
for Franco and Ollie.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.332
Ever since we was kids.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.581
Boom.

06:57.664 --> 07:01.998
Got all that shit up here...
cookin' in my noggin.

07:02.082 --> 07:03.956
What is this?

07:04.040 --> 07:06.539
- The Jewish Activist Center--
- No.

07:06.623 --> 07:11.332
That... is the next phase
of Franco and Ollie.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.748
That is the Atlantic
9-Ball Open Rally.

07:13.831 --> 07:17.539
$250 to enter,
$25,000 cash prize
for the winner.

07:17.623 --> 07:19.456
Hmm?

07:19.539 --> 07:23.915
Yeah! That is how
we get out of this
dead-end road hustle bullshit

07:23.998 --> 07:26.165
and take it to the fuckin' bank.

07:26.248 --> 07:27.498
Right?

07:27.581 --> 07:29.332
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

07:29.414 --> 07:31.581
We got it!

07:31.664 --> 07:33.998
Man on TV:
...would continue to push
our deficit even higher.

07:34.082 --> 07:37.414
- I don't know, man.
- You're not gettin' it.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.123
Don't you see?

07:41.498 --> 07:43.332
This is what we been
training you up for

07:43.414 --> 07:45.290
these last four years
on the road.

07:45.373 --> 07:49.956
Hell, we been...
training you up

07:50.040 --> 07:52.373
ever since I moved in with you
when we was kids,

07:52.456 --> 07:55.998
when we was 7 and 9 years old.

07:56.082 --> 07:59.748
Workin' on bank shots
and top spins
and all of the shit

07:59.831 --> 08:02.290
in the back room at Willie's.

08:02.373 --> 08:04.831
It was all leading up
to this moment right here.

08:04.915 --> 08:07.248
Hmm? Me and you. Together.

08:07.332 --> 08:10.956
Me with the smooth...
pretty face...

08:11.040 --> 08:12.498
( clicks tongue )

08:12.581 --> 08:15.082
...you with
the pool shark hands.

08:15.165 --> 08:16.915
Hmm?

08:16.998 --> 08:18.956
Perfect team.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.915
Fifty-fifty.

08:20.998 --> 08:22.706
Like we always been.

08:22.790 --> 08:24.706
Like fuckin' brothers.

08:26.873 --> 08:31.248
Man on TV:
But now, more to come
on this evening's report.

08:31.332 --> 08:32.581
Ever since--

08:32.664 --> 08:34.373
...hazardous
classroom conditions...

08:34.456 --> 08:36.414
your m-- I'm gonna
turn this shit off.

08:36.498 --> 08:38.998
College basketball heats up.
This and all--

08:39.082 --> 08:41.332
( turns TV off )

08:47.998 --> 08:49.706
When your mama...

08:49.790 --> 08:52.414
took my ass in
like I was her own,

08:52.498 --> 08:55.373
fed me, clothed me--

08:55.456 --> 08:58.290
I ain't never gonna
forget that shit.

08:58.373 --> 09:02.539
It's a debt I owed to her,
and now that she's gone,
it's a debt I owe to you.

09:02.623 --> 09:05.873
And I'm takin' you all the way,
baby boy, we doin' this,
you and me.

09:05.956 --> 09:07.831
You hear me?

09:07.915 --> 09:09.790
You and me.

09:09.873 --> 09:12.248
You with me?
Hmm?

09:12.332 --> 09:13.790
( pats Ollie's back )

09:13.873 --> 09:15.831
Hmm?

09:15.915 --> 09:20.040
( sing-song )
Franco and Ollie,
about to make dough,

09:20.123 --> 09:23.706
Franco and Ollie,
always on the road.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.790
Come on, man!

09:25.873 --> 09:27.207
Hmm?

09:28.664 --> 09:31.831
What the fuck
is up with you, man?

09:31.915 --> 09:34.873
You hearin'
what I'm sayin',
right?

09:34.956 --> 09:36.831
You get it, right?
Hmm?

09:36.915 --> 09:39.623
I'm not stupid.
I hear you.

09:39.706 --> 09:42.748
What the fuck is with you
tonight, Ollie, man? Damn!

09:46.581 --> 09:49.998
- It's just, like...
- Just what, Ollie?

09:50.082 --> 09:55.956
It's just, you didn't tell me
that the plan was for us
to be doin' tournaments.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.414
OK, so now you know the plan.

10:00.248 --> 10:02.539
I know, but, like..

10:02.623 --> 10:05.664
if we doin' tournaments,
that's--

10:05.748 --> 10:09.082
that's a whole different thing,
like, I mean,

10:09.165 --> 10:13.664
if we doin' tournaments,
I'm gonna be the one
doing the playin', right?

10:13.748 --> 10:15.790
Uh, yeah.

10:15.873 --> 10:19.873
So what are you
gonna be doin'?

10:21.623 --> 10:23.748
- I'm the manager.
- I know that.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.414
So I will be
fuckin' managin' you.

10:28.623 --> 10:33.040
Look, Ollie, I know you ain't
the brightest bulb and all,
but...

10:33.123 --> 10:35.165
this makes sense to you, right?

10:35.248 --> 10:37.539
Look, man,
I'm not stupid.
You keep sayin' that.

10:37.623 --> 10:40.040
I'm not stupid, all right?
I get it.

10:40.123 --> 10:41.790
What I'm sayin' is, like,

10:41.873 --> 10:44.748
when we out
on the road hustlin',
I get it,

10:44.831 --> 10:46.915
like, you do
important things,

10:46.998 --> 10:48.748
you do stuff, you go in,
you--

10:48.831 --> 10:51.498
Yeah, I do things. I--
D-Damn right, I do things.
I do a lot of things.

10:51.581 --> 10:53.207
You do stuff. You do things.
That's what I said.

10:53.290 --> 10:54.456
You go places,
you do stuff.

10:54.539 --> 10:56.873
Why you seem
so unclear on that?

10:56.956 --> 10:58.706
- I'm just--
- Yeah, I do things.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.831
But when it come
to the tournaments...

11:00.915 --> 11:04.539
I got the money set aside
for that fee.

11:04.623 --> 11:09.248
I'm doin' the playin'.
The games is already set up.

11:09.332 --> 11:12.248
I don't see that
bein' a 50-50 thing.

11:12.332 --> 11:14.414
( snorts )

11:14.498 --> 11:17.207
Hmm. Well, OK.

11:22.165 --> 11:23.998
All right, I see, man.

11:24.082 --> 11:26.414
- It's a question of my value.
- Franco, I'm not tryin' to--

11:26.498 --> 11:27.831
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:27.915 --> 11:30.456
You got to talk.

11:30.539 --> 11:32.581
Let me say my piece now.

11:32.664 --> 11:37.831
Let me explain something
to you, Ollie. Hmm?

11:39.248 --> 11:40.956
I don't think you realize

11:41.040 --> 11:43.248
how much fuckin'...

11:43.332 --> 11:45.915
hard work, skill,

11:45.998 --> 11:48.207
dedication, brain power,

11:48.290 --> 11:50.790
goes into this operation
I created for us here.

11:50.873 --> 11:53.623
Somebody gotta book
the bus tickets,

11:53.706 --> 11:55.790
gotta find the cheapest room
to stay in town.

11:55.873 --> 11:58.539
Gotta find a pool hall
that don't know about us yet,

11:58.623 --> 12:02.123
gotta sniff out the player
in there that you can definitely
beat to get things rollin'.

12:02.207 --> 12:05.790
Then I gotta make sure
I sniff out any other hustlers
in there that got us  beat,

12:05.873 --> 12:10.290
avoid them, set you up
with just the right sucker
who got more money than skill,

12:10.373 --> 12:11.831
make the deal with him,

12:11.915 --> 12:14.373
or his motherfuckin'
piece-of-shit-ass manager,

12:14.456 --> 12:18.082
then distract
said piece-of-shit manager
with conversation

12:18.165 --> 12:20.873
while you're playin',
but still keep my eye
on the game...

12:20.956 --> 12:22.290
so I know how much to bet

12:22.373 --> 12:23.956
- come next round.
- I know all--

12:24.040 --> 12:25.623
No, no, no, no, no.
Let me fuckin' finish, Ollie.

12:25.706 --> 12:30.915
And I do this shit
over and over and over again,

12:30.998 --> 12:33.040
plus I gotta keep it all
positive and shit all the time

12:33.123 --> 12:35.165
'cause you up here
questionin' me and everything,

12:35.248 --> 12:38.706
man, and acting
all moody all the time,
like tonight.

12:40.082 --> 12:41.123
So...

12:45.082 --> 12:46.915
So I ain't just the manager,

12:46.998 --> 12:49.332
I'm your fuckin' shrink, too.

12:49.414 --> 12:52.498
- But I don't need a shrink.
- Yes, you do,

12:52.581 --> 12:53.790
whether you realize it
or not.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.165
Whether you ask for it or not,
you do.

12:56.248 --> 12:58.332
And you need me to do
all the shit I do for you

12:58.414 --> 13:01.831
and to take care of you,
and the only thing
you gotta fuckin' do...

13:01.915 --> 13:07.123
is go out and play with
some fuckin' sticks and balls

13:07.207 --> 13:10.873
when I tell you to,
and with who I tell you
to play with. That's it.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.873
That's your whole fuckin' job.

13:12.956 --> 13:15.498
- That's not all I do.
- That is all you fuckin' do!

13:15.581 --> 13:17.831
Ollie! That's it!

13:17.915 --> 13:20.414
But you don't see me
complainin'

13:20.498 --> 13:23.165
and questionin' your value
in the 50-50, do you?

13:26.790 --> 13:30.290
But I'm workin' with what I got,
and what I got is a fuckin'...

13:30.373 --> 13:32.790
half-wit who plays
with sticks and balls
as a partner,

13:32.873 --> 13:37.123
and he's up here tellin' me
that I ain't worth my weight
in the 50-50?

13:37.207 --> 13:39.915
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?
Let me tell you some shit.

13:39.998 --> 13:42.332
That sounds like
a big old "fuck you" to me.

13:42.414 --> 13:44.165
Because I think I'm worth
my 50 percent,

13:44.248 --> 13:46.456
and a hell of a lot more,
if you ask me.

13:53.998 --> 13:55.373
( tamps out cigarette )

14:03.664 --> 14:04.998
( closes window )

14:09.664 --> 14:12.539
So, I guess that's why
you been takin' extra.

14:14.873 --> 14:17.082
Excuse me?

14:17.165 --> 14:20.498
I said, so that's--
that's why you been
takin' extra.

14:20.581 --> 14:22.664
What the fuck
you talkin' about, Ollie?

14:26.248 --> 14:30.332
Pull your money out
and count it up
next to mine for me.

14:32.623 --> 14:35.623
- You think I'm cheatin' you?
- Just count the money, Franco.

14:35.706 --> 14:37.123
- Why?
- Who not?

14:37.207 --> 14:39.790
- So you don't trust me now?
- Should I?

14:39.873 --> 14:41.456
I been livin' with you
for over 30 years,

14:41.539 --> 14:42.956
your mama raised me
like I was her own.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.956
- I know! I know!
- Like brothers.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.456
Just count the money, Franco!

14:46.539 --> 14:50.498
No, thank you, Ollie,
I already counted it.

14:53.207 --> 14:55.123
Well, I did, too.

14:55.207 --> 14:56.790
Twice.

14:56.873 --> 14:59.082
While you was in there
hittin' them high notes,

14:59.165 --> 15:01.706
singing that "Zestfully clean"
commercial.

15:04.623 --> 15:07.790
You went through my shit?

15:07.873 --> 15:10.623
I ain't as dumb
as you think, Franco.

15:10.706 --> 15:13.456
I know how to count, too.

15:13.539 --> 15:16.831
I know how to count up to $94,

15:16.915 --> 15:19.539
and I know how to count
to $95, too.

15:19.623 --> 15:23.498
- Yeah, it was around that.
- No, it wasn't around nothin'.

15:23.581 --> 15:27.123
You said it was 94,
and it was 95,
I counted it twice,

15:27.207 --> 15:29.664
damn near three times!

15:29.748 --> 15:33.165
And I know that big-ass
head of yours don't miscount.

15:33.248 --> 15:35.165
You  never  miscount!

15:35.248 --> 15:38.831
So you tell me
why I'm the one
who gets 47

15:38.915 --> 15:40.915
and you're walkin' around
with 48.

15:40.998 --> 15:42.290
Answer me that.

15:42.373 --> 15:43.706
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.082
A dollar?

15:47.248 --> 15:50.456
That's what this whole
motherfuckin' thing is about,
a-a dollar?!

15:50.539 --> 15:52.831
You lied to me.

15:52.915 --> 15:54.539
Whoa!

15:55.915 --> 15:57.998
( laughing )

15:58.082 --> 16:01.165
Whoo! A do--
A fuckin' dollar?

16:03.040 --> 16:06.290
I didn't have any change.
I couldn't split it.

16:06.373 --> 16:11.456
So I figured I would give you
the extra dollar next time
we had a odd number.

16:11.539 --> 16:13.248
So why not tell me that?

16:13.332 --> 16:16.498
'Cause I-- 'Cause I didn't think
it was important!

16:16.581 --> 16:19.539
So it's important
to lie to me instead
and say it's 94.

16:19.623 --> 16:21.581
I didn't want to
confuse your brain
with the details.

16:21.664 --> 16:23.498
- Stop sayin' I'm stupid!
- Well, if you're gonna

16:23.581 --> 16:25.207
take me to the mattress
over a fuckin' dollar,

16:25.290 --> 16:26.664
I think you're pretty
fuckin' stupid, Ollie.

16:26.748 --> 16:28.207
It's not about the dollar.

16:28.290 --> 16:29.998
I don't know what the fuck
this is about, man.

16:30.082 --> 16:31.664
It's about you thinkin'
you're better than me!

16:31.748 --> 16:34.373
- Shut the fuck up.
- You just said it!

16:34.456 --> 16:35.956
You just said it.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.248
That I'm not good for shit
but a stick and balls!

16:39.373 --> 16:41.831
You could've gave me
that extra dollar,

16:41.915 --> 16:44.998
but no, you chose to keep it
for yourself...

16:45.082 --> 16:47.498
and lie to me about it.

16:50.332 --> 16:52.790
The fuck, man?

16:52.873 --> 16:54.831
We're supposed
to be brothers...

16:56.414 --> 16:57.706
...and that shit right there,

16:57.790 --> 16:59.623
that fucks up
our brotherhood, man!

16:59.706 --> 17:02.414
That breaks our trust!

17:02.498 --> 17:04.831
And I can't trust you
no more, Franco.

17:07.539 --> 17:11.040
- This is insane.
- Why'd you lie to me then, man?

17:11.123 --> 17:13.706
Why not say something truthful
for once?

17:13.790 --> 17:16.664
What do you want me to say,
Ollie? Huh?

17:19.207 --> 17:21.998
I gave myself
an extra dollar.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.873
Yeah, sure.

17:23.956 --> 17:26.414
Maybe the fuckin'
back of my mind
told me to do it

17:26.498 --> 17:29.207
because I think
I'm worth more than 50-50.

17:29.290 --> 17:32.623
Or maybe that shit
was just random,
I don't know.

17:32.706 --> 17:36.664
But if you're willing
to blow this whole enterprise up
over a fuckin' dollar,

17:36.748 --> 17:39.790
all I got to say
is fuck you, my brother.

17:39.873 --> 17:42.373
Fuck you.
Because I'll go out there
and I'll find another player

17:42.456 --> 17:46.581
who will appreciate me
and what I bring to the table.

17:46.664 --> 17:48.623
- You can't find nobody.
- Yes, I can!

17:48.706 --> 17:50.456
I can find somebody
who appreciate me!

17:50.539 --> 17:52.748
'Cause your ass
is fuckin' ungrateful.

17:52.831 --> 17:54.414
And petty.

17:54.498 --> 17:57.082
And temperamental
and fuckin' fragile.

17:58.456 --> 18:00.915
So you want your dollar?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.873
( rummaging )

18:05.082 --> 18:06.414
Here.

18:07.915 --> 18:09.790
You happy?

18:10.956 --> 18:12.290
I hope so.

18:13.748 --> 18:15.581
'Cause I'm done with you.

18:17.414 --> 18:19.082
We done.

18:21.623 --> 18:23.040
But you can sleep here, though.

18:23.123 --> 18:24.373
Tonight.

18:25.748 --> 18:28.915
Good. I pay for
half this room anyway,

18:28.998 --> 18:30.831
and you snore like
a fuckin' grizzly bear.

18:30.915 --> 18:34.082
- Get the fuck outta here, man.
- Whatever, Ollie, man.

18:35.790 --> 18:37.498
I just don't want to see you
when I get up.

18:37.581 --> 18:40.873

18:54.748 --> 18:56.290

19:27.539 --> 19:30.207
Actually...

19:30.290 --> 19:31.998
fuck that.

19:33.082 --> 19:34.207
I changed my mind.

19:36.664 --> 19:38.498
Give me the dollar back, Ollie.

19:38.581 --> 19:40.290
What dollar?

19:40.373 --> 19:42.248
Hand it over.

19:42.332 --> 19:44.581
I don't know what
you talkin' about, Franco.

19:44.664 --> 19:48.290
You said it was $94, right?
We split it 50-50.

19:48.373 --> 19:50.790
Ha ha. Shut the fuck up.
Don't piss me off.

19:50.873 --> 19:52.539
Give me the fuckin' dollar.

19:52.623 --> 19:54.915
No.

19:54.998 --> 19:57.748
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

19:57.831 --> 20:00.165
I'm gonna be real nice
about it.

20:00.248 --> 20:02.123
Give me the dollar, please.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.831

asked so nicely...

You gonna kick me?
