01:30.257 --> 01:32.259
There was no one like Hal.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.061
He met me at a party
and swept me off my feet.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.764
"Blue Moon" was playing.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.474
You know "Blue Moon?"
Sure.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.026
I still remember that.
Oh.

01:42.853 --> 01:46.153
And one more year
and I would have graduated.

01:46.356 --> 01:50.202
But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,
what was I learning at school anyway?

01:50.402 --> 01:53.451
I mean, can you picture me
as an anthropologist?

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:55.490 --> 01:56.992
Is that a joke?

01:57.200 --> 02:00.545
The sex was always great. Well,
he was nine years older than me.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.748
He'd already made
and lost a fortune.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.005
But then he made it back,
and more. I mean, much more.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.506
God, he was dynamic.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.430
Taught me everything I know
about real lovemaking,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.850
not that I care to get too graphic.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.270
Believe me when I tell you.
They tried six medications on me.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.097
Cocktails, they call them.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.899
The only cocktail that helped
was a Stoli martini.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.351
I never trusted doctors.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.187
Doctors put both my parents
in early graves.

been to San Francisco.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.443
And Hal and I traveled everywhere.
I hear it's beautiful.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.495
I'll be staying with my sister,
Ginger. She's divorced.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.916
Biologically, she's not my sister.
She's adopted. <i>We're</i> both adopted.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.869
I couldn't stand her ex-husband.
He used to hit her.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.046
That's mine. The Vuitton.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.125
My plan is to start a new life out here.
Hm.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.961
Put everything behind me
and start fresh.

who said that? "Go West."

02:53.590 --> 02:56.890
Oh, there's my family.
It was really nice talking to you.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.688
JASMINE: Oh, I'll call you,
maybe for lunch.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.232
I don't have your number.

03:02.974 --> 03:07.275
Who's that woman you were talking to?
I was sitting next to her on the plane.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.901
She was talking to herself.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.780
I thought she said something to me.
I said, "What?"

But she couldn't stop
babbling about her life.

She expected me.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.657
The plane was on time.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.624
Yes, I'm-- I'm--
You all right?

04:08.832 --> 04:12.803
I'm fine. I just sometimes get
where I can't take a deep breath

04:13.003 --> 04:17.884
and when I can, it makes me panic
and it makes it even worse.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.764
Okay.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.014
Could I have some privacy?
Sure, sure.

No, no, I see it.
Okay. Oh, okay.

I love it.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.547

like when they're for show.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.550
It's so light and airy
and the ceilings are so high.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.598
How can anyone breathe
with a low ceiling? The view.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.393
You wanted Fifth Avenue.

We hardly have to do a thing.

You shouldn't spoil me so.
Well, why not?

06:12.747 --> 06:15.591
Sure I do. You gotta remember
as you go through life

06:15.792 --> 06:18.511
to share what you earn
with the less fortunate.

your idea of taking the boys?

Uh-huh.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.965
When she had money,
she wanted nothing to do with you.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.175
Now that she's broke,
she's moving in.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.386
She's not just broke.
She's screwed up.

And it's none of your damn
business. She's family.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.849
She stole our money.
Okay.

Understand? We could have been set.
That was our whole chance in life.

For the last time, Augie,
he was the crook, not her, okay?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.819
What the hell did she know
about finance?

08:05.026 --> 08:08.826
Don't stand there and tell me that.
She's married to a guy for years,

and bank fraud.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.702

Believe me, she knew, Ginger.
Okay? She knew.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.710
But when all those diamonds
and minks were flying in,

08:20.917 --> 08:24.046
she just looked the other way.
I don't think so, Augie.

08:24.254 --> 08:29.556

house is so beautiful.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.807

I'm sorry, but we need an answer on this.

I told you, you change the name
of the corporation.

I don't know if we can.

step ahead of the Justice Department.

Oh, I never pay attention
to Hal's business affairs.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.662
I have no head
for that sort of thing.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.250

We could. Perfectly legal.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.713
It would be a mistake under that name.
Definitely get in trouble for that.

No, I do.

I'm out of cash.
Okay.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.619

Can you believe

10:11.820 --> 10:14.824
I had to move out of my home,
take a place in Brooklyn?

when I'm alone.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.337

you look great.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.799
Oh. Now who's lying?
You do.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.850
You know, I was up all last night.
I was so anxious

10:35.051 --> 10:36.553
Yeah? about moving hem

10:36.761 --> 10:40.482
I wasn't sure how angry you still were.
Oh, well...

10:41.724 --> 10:44.568

Of course, yeah.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.022
Oh, the flight was bumpy.
Uh-huh.

10:47.230 --> 10:51.360
I didn't eat anything on the plane.
Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.412
I mean, you'd think
first class, right?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.493
You flew first class?

10:56.698 --> 10:59.417
I don't know how anyone puts up
with those airlines.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.338
Isn't first class a fortune?
Yes, I was quite shocked.

11:03.538 --> 11:07.463
I thought you were tapped out.
I'm worse than tapped out, baby.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.886
I've run up some serious debts.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.884
So how did you fly first class?

11:12.088 --> 11:15.934
I don't know, Ginger.
I just did.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.888
All I meant was, if you've got
no money, to go first class...

11:20.096 --> 11:22.895
You know me.
I splurge from habit.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.149

at my luggage?

11:27.353 --> 11:29.526
Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.409
You told me you had to sell everything.
Look, look, look.

11:33.610 --> 11:37.410
These are used, old suitcases.
See, with my initials. Who'd want them?

11:37.614 --> 11:40.959
I sold what jewels and furs
I could hide from Uncle Sam.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.002
God, I hate to tell you about that.

11:43.203 --> 11:47.458
Jewelry is priceless, a great investment
when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef

11:47.665 --> 11:50.669
until you're desperate for money
and forced to sell,

11:50.877 --> 11:53.096
and then it seems
you can't give it away.

that I'm wearing to the Met Gala.

What's the matter?
Your mind is a million miles away.

12:44.681 --> 12:49.653
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I-- I just got
a call from my sister, Ginger.

12:49.852 --> 12:54.153
Oh, God, she's coming to New York
for a week with her husband, Augie.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.825
He is a piece of work.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.619
I just-- I don't know,
I guess I have to see them.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.198
The one in San Francisco, the builder?
Yeah.

13:01.406 --> 13:05.081
Oh, no, he's a contractor. I mean,
he's-- No, he's a handyman.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.414
No, don't get me wrong.
I love Ginger, I do. She's a dear.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.545
But our paths just went
in totally different directions.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.841
Okay, that happens.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.046
It's terrible of me to say,
but she was never too bright.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.724
You know? And she was so wild
and I, of course, was Miss Perfect.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.595
Hi.
JASMINE: Oh, you made it.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.851
How lovely to see you.
Hi. Oh, my God.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.648
Welcome.
Hi. Thank you.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.022
Oh, this is my husband, Augie.
Augie.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.399
This is Jeanette.
Jasmine. I changed it.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.197
Jasmine.
I'm finally getting to meet the sister.

13:35.398 --> 13:39.278
I know. Hello. I'm so sorry we
couldn't make it to the wedding.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.988
Just that Hal had some
business in Saint-Tropez.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.198
Couldn't get back in time.
Know what?

13:44.407 --> 13:47.832
You missed a nice little party.
My friend Dennis sang.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.539
He's great. Dennis Rackabuto.
I know. Hey--

13:50.747 --> 13:53.421
Hal! You remember
Ginger.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.001
Oh, my gosh.
How are you?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.711
How are you?
This is Augie.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.592
Augie. How you doing?
Awesome.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.719
Hell of a place you got.
Thank you.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.800
Why don't you come through?
Told you.

AUGIE: This is really...

14:05.094 --> 14:06.266
Yeah, she's got taste.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.439
AUGIE: It's like what
you see in the movies.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.394
We have so much to catch up on. Can't
wait for you to show us New York.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.604
Why don't you take
our car and driver?

14:14.812 --> 14:18.066
Well, I hope you're gonna come.
I mean, how often am I here?

14:18.274 --> 14:22.154
No, no, I will definitely make some time.
GINGER: Oh, good. Heh, heh.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.244
Where are you staying?

14:25.448 --> 14:28.952
Oh, well, we-- We thought about
asking if we could stay with you,

14:29.160 --> 14:32.585
but we don't wanna impose,
so we got a room at the Marriott.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.632
Oh, the Marriott's perfect.
Oh. Yeah.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.836
I'll have my office contact them
and forward us the bill.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.263
Oh, no.
No, no, no, it's not necessary.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.591
Please, you're our guests.
I insist.

14:42.799 --> 14:46.224
Oh, well, then we insist
on taking you two to dinner tonight.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.773
What? Tonight?
GINGER: Yeah.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.563
We have dinner plans.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.691
I don't think we can--
Something we can't get out of.

I'm sorry' GINGER: There'll be time.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.905
We stashed the kids with Augie's
sister, we're here for a week.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.952
It's gonna be great.
It is. Okay.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.701
Well, we don't have
a lot of free time,

15:05.905 --> 15:08.829
but we'll definitely take you
to Le Cirque, won't we?

15:09.033 --> 15:10.455
I mean, or Daniel. I mean--

15:10.660 --> 15:13.459
They'd get a kick out of that.
Yeah, absolutely.

15:13.663 --> 15:17.918
I know your birthday is this week.
Let us at least take you out for that.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.465
I love how you're doing your hair.
Oh, thanks. Heh, heh.

15:23.673 --> 15:27.928

always could pick clothes. Heh, heh.

Don't worry, I don't need to
borrow money. We're flush.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.114
Yeah,
What kind of work do you do, Augie?

15:40.314 --> 15:43.659
Well, you know, I do, like,
repairs, furniture moving,

15:43.860 --> 15:45.862
but I got plans to be
my own boss.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.744
We'll talk about it over dinner.
They're going out.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.370

15:50.575 --> 15:54.830
Oh, yeah, of course. Why don't
you start in the kitchen?

Is there a little girls' room?
Just down the hall.

to my birthday party now.

Where did she come up with him?
I always feel so guilty around Ginger.

we make their stay extra nice.

of when I was a kid.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.889

23:36.123 --> 23:40.003
You looked at me.
Yeah, once. It was a mistake.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.802
All right, listen.
What?

23:44.006 --> 23:46.350
You think Hal's banging her?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.099
When Jasmine don't wanna
know something,

23:49.303 --> 23:52.273
she's got a habit
of looking the other way.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.693
Thank you for my present.
I got so many comments.

23:55.893 --> 23:59.193
I think everyone enjoyed themselves
and that piano player was--

23:59.396 --> 24:01.899
He was fantastic.
I got his card.

24:02.107 --> 24:06.157
What were you, uh, talking to
Raylene so intensely about?

24:06.362 --> 24:10.242
Oh, uh, her husband is thinking
about getting his own plane.

24:10.449 --> 24:15.250
I was just weighing the pros and cons
for her of a Challenger versus a, uh--

24:15.454 --> 24:18.082
Gulf stream?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.877
She's so pretty.
Yeah.

24:21.085 --> 24:24.339
Bill's out of town for a couple
weeks and she'll be all alone.

24:24.546 --> 24:28.722
I thought maybe we could take her out
to dinner or have her over here.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.723
Yeah.
Great.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.555
Sure.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.694
This is silly, Ginger.
Why?

24:39.895 --> 24:41.021
It's Sunday.
So?

24:41.230 --> 24:44.404
It's his day off. He wants
to spend it alone with you.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.406
He's alone with me plenty.

24:46.610 --> 24:50.080
If I'm gonna marry Chili, you're
gonna meet him sooner than later.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.123
I told him we'd show you
the town.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.420
Well, he won't want your sister around.
Will you stop it?

24:57.079 --> 25:00.299
JASMINE:
This city is so beautifully European.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.422
Have you ever been abroad?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.128
At all?
No.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.465
We used to sail
from Saint-Tropez to Cannes

25:07.673 --> 25:10.051
and up the coast to Monaco.
Hm.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.555
It reminds me of the Mediterranean.
There's Chili.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.605
JASMINE: Which one?
GINGER: There.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.683
JASMINE: Who's that with him?
GINGER: I don't know.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.852
Chili.
CHILI: Hi.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.903
GINGER: Hi, hey.
You look beautiful.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.027
GINGER: Oh, thanks.
Yeah.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.071
You smell good too.
You're late.

25:26.275 --> 25:29.279
Eddie. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Ginger. Hi.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.578
This is Jasmine.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.873
Jasmine, hi. I'm Eddie.
This is Eddie.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.246
Nice to meet you. Eddie.
I'm Jasmine.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.124
Hi.
Ginger told me about you.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.580
Oh, all good, I hope.

25:39.788 --> 25:43.042
I gotta tell you, I was all set
to move in with your sister.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.925
Then she tells me that we gotta
postpone because her sister's in town.

25:47.129 --> 25:50.008
He's joking.
Well, I hope I didn't inconvenience you.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.432
It was an emergency.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.682
No.
Things happen. Right, Eddie?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.684
Could've happened
to anybody.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.482
Told me you never been here,
don't know anybody,

25:58.682 --> 26:01.606
so I brought along this
sad excuse for a blind date.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.609
Best he could do on short notice.
He works with me.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.110
I gotta get a beer.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.613
You want a beer?
Can I buy you a drink?

26:08.817 --> 26:11.991
I have a drink, but thank you.
I'm dropping dead of hunger.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.290
This place has the best clams.

26:14.490 --> 26:15.992
You like clams, Jasmine?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.126
No, no, no.
I'm not hungry.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.623
What the hell are you drinking?
Let me see. What is this?

26:21.830 --> 26:23.002
Is it vodka?
Martini.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.050
CHILI: This place has the
best clams in the city.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.882
The best are at Manero's.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.965
You're nuts. They don't even compare.
Who cares?

26:30.172 --> 26:33.722
This place is good too. They're fresh.
That's the thing with clams.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.930
You get a bad clam,
you'll wish you were never born.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.482
So, what do you do, Jasmine?
I told you, she just got here.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.525
She's looking for a job.
EDDIE: Yeah?

26:42.851 --> 26:45.320
I know a dentist
who's looking for help.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.569
Oh, yeah?
No, I'm actually thinking

26:47.773 --> 26:50.196
of going back to school. Hm.
CHILI: School?

26:50.526 --> 26:53.120
Heh. To study what?

26:54.655 --> 26:57.579
I don't know. I mean,
the biggest mistake I made

26:57.783 --> 27:02.004
was leaving college in my last year
and not completing my education.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.501
What would you be?

27:03.705 --> 27:05.298
An anthropologist.

27:05.999 --> 27:08.502
Really?
Like digging up old fossils?

27:08.710 --> 27:10.178
That's an archaeologist.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.381
Ginger told me the
whole story.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.091
That must be terrible, right?

GINGER: Her husband,
he owned racehorses.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.726
EDDIE: Is that so?
GINGER: Yeah.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.938
Oh, yes, yes,
for a year or two,

27:27.146 --> 27:29.649
Hal became quite obsessed
with thoroughbreds.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.322
So, what are you gonna
study in college?

27:32.526 --> 27:33.573
EDDIE:
Let me guess.

27:34.278 --> 27:36.372
A nurse. Huh?
Ooh.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.624
Is that how
I impress you?

27:38.824 --> 27:41.873
A nurse?
You got something against nurses?

27:42.077 --> 27:45.422
My sister's a nurse.
Nurses are very hot to go to bed with.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.796
They have extensive knowledge
of how the human body works.

27:49.001 --> 27:53.097
Careful what you accuse my sister of.
CHILI: Just saying, I know good nurses.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.345
GINGER: Chili, why don't
you change the subject?

27:55.549 --> 27:58.393
You think you're being charming,
but you're not.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.972
You always stare into space
like that?

28:01.889 --> 28:03.857
I had a friend who used to do that,

28:04.057 --> 28:07.186
but there was something wrong
with him. He was epileptic.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.773
I'm not epileptic.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.902
If you see the waitress,
I'd like another Stoli martini.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.454
CHILI: What are you gonna study?
GINGER: Leave her alone.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.908
It's like the third time you asked.
So? She hasn't answered.

28:21.116 --> 28:24.245
I don't know, but I'll be sure
to keep you informed.

28:24.453 --> 28:28.833
Oh, okay, sorry. I'll back off.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be curt.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.295
I just don't know what I'm gonna
do with the rest of my life.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.847
What do you wanna do?
Why don't we take her to see the sights?

28:36.048 --> 28:39.894
Then back to my place. She likes vodka.
My buddy's just back from Russia.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.562
Brought me this incredible vodka.
Great idea.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.142

Yeah, let's go.

had a garden.

Thank you.

They got tours in there, Jasmine.
Ginger said your ex-husband did time?

29:27.975 --> 29:31.400
He'd still be doing time
if he didn't hang himself in his cell.

29:31.603 --> 29:35.324
Really? Like with a belt?
Well, it had to be a belt. Or a bedsheet.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.992
Could be a bedsheet.
JASMINE: No.

29:37.192 --> 29:41.538
He managed to get
a piece of rope.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.908
Plain rope.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.118
You can get anything
if you got juice.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.920
That's some way to go, huh?
Strangle yourself to death?

29:49.121 --> 29:51.590
No, it wasn't strangulation.

When you hang yourself,
your neck breaks.

29:54.668 --> 29:57.547

Oh, yeah?
Yeah, including me and Augie and her.

on other people's money.

to the Yankee game tonight.

I'd go to any sporting event with you,
you know, but I just never got baseball.

I love baseball. Why?

Well, why doesn't he
ask me himself?

that this is any of your business.

you know, something substantial.

at our apartment came in

and I waited on them. I mean,
do you have any idea what that's like?

You know, one minute,
you're hosting women

their shoe size and fitting them.

and was so embarrassed for me,

she slipped out
thinking I didn't see her.

I saw you, Erica!

Are you okay?

in fashion.

Or designing. Yeah?

Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.

No, Eve Logan got
her decorator's license online.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.505
On a computer?

34:51.715 --> 34:53.092
I guess you could, but--

34:53.300 --> 34:56.679
Yeah, I'm so computer illiterate.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.773
But I could take a class
in computers.

34:59.973 --> 35:04.695
And then when I can handle a computer,
then I can study decorating online.

35:04.894 --> 35:09.240
That sounds too complicated.
Why is your reaction always negative?

35:09.441 --> 35:11.068
I'm just saying.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.654
You know, first you gotta
learn computers,

35:13.862 --> 35:16.490
and then go for a decorator's
license online.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.872
You're afraid
I'll stay here too long.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.828
No, you know--

35:22.037 --> 35:25.337
Just all those courses,
they cost money.

35:26.374 --> 35:30.925
You'll work out here. It's mostly phones
and keeping my appointments straight.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.224
There's the follow-up cards,
which I explained,

35:34.424 --> 35:37.143
and the notices for cleanings.

Yes, a cancellation.

36:01.910 --> 36:05.210
Can you just put someone on
who speaks better English?

36:05.413 --> 36:10.010

is what provides you, the user,

36:10.210 --> 36:13.680
the ability to control the hardware,
the computer.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.553
Okay, that's the operating--

The operating system
gives you that ability.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.575

The 14th?
Oh, no.

Is 3 good on the 9th?

Or noon on the 11th?

36:48.081 --> 36:52.131
Can you just settle on a time, please?
Just pick a time.

It would.

good at it, but it keeps him busy.

No.

He's a math genius.

and everyone said
it was the best lecture.

interior design online.

for space and color

38:32.727 --> 38:35.526
and an eye for choosing
soft furnishings.

38:35.730 --> 38:39.951
It's very commendable, but I can't
really have you studying on work time

with the business at hand.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.331

It won't happen again.

a drink with me?

a quick one

Are they conscientious?
Are they disciplined? Are they vain?

Or careless? You have
to know what to look for.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.416

I have to keep an eye on it.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.913

blame everything on your genes.

have a really nice collection of cars.

Yes, they are.

is nothing to be ashamed of.

Yeah, with other people's money.

I mean, what do I know
about financial schemes?

44:43.014 --> 44:46.564

every stick of furniture,

44:49.645 --> 44:52.239
every fur, every ring
and every bank account,

44:52.440 --> 44:55.319
and still it wasn't enough
to placate the government.

44:55.526 --> 44:58.370
Her husband was a slick operator.
I was there a week,

44:58.571 --> 45:03.247
I knew he was hitting on her girlfriend.
I really need to study.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.920
I need some peace, okay?
GINGER: Okay.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.624
I'm not gonna make it
if you turn this place into a nightclub.

45:09.832 --> 45:12.836
I can't. I just can't.

Ginger, I'm really-- I don't--
I don't know what came over me.

45:42.490 --> 45:46.336
But I have told you before, your taste
in men leaves a lot to be desired.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.958
Yeah, I know these are
not your kind of guys.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.837

Yeah, I know what you
think of it here.

46:00.091 --> 46:02.435
I mean,
you've got two kids.

46:02.635 --> 46:05.730
You can do better than Chili
and his drunken loser friends.

46:05.930 --> 46:10.026
If I thought I could do better, I would.
So far no one's beating my door down.

46:10.226 --> 46:13.025
You know, he's sexy
and he doesn't steal.

46:13.229 --> 46:18.656
Okay, okay. Do you always have to
make those stupid sarcastic digs?

46:18.818 --> 46:20.161
(SIGHS)

46:20.486 --> 46:22.113
I'm scared, Hal.

46:22.321 --> 46:25.700
Paula said the reason Howard
is leaving Global Innovations

46:25.908 --> 46:29.913
is he's not comfortable with business
practices from a legal standpoint.

46:30.121 --> 46:32.215
Howard Trask is such a pussy.
No, no--

46:32.415 --> 46:36.261
What do you think I have lawyers for?
He didn't wanna wind up in jail.

46:36.460 --> 46:40.181
Jail? Jesus.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

46:40.381 --> 46:43.681
If I back out now, I hate to tell you
how much money we'd lose.

46:43.884 --> 46:47.514
It's like a domino effect.
One thing would follow the other.

46:47.722 --> 46:51.022
Hey, let me deal with it, okay?

46:51.225 --> 46:53.978
Is there anything you want
that you don't have?

46:54.186 --> 46:55.688
Is there?

46:56.063 --> 46:57.280
No.

46:57.481 --> 47:00.530
So stop worrying
and let me spoil you.

47:00.735 --> 47:04.035
No, I agree. I mean, Howard
always was a prissy mama's boy.

47:04.238 --> 47:07.492
Yeah, mama's boy.
That's the perfect phrase.

47:07.700 --> 47:12.797
Okay, how about Tuesday
the 22nd at 9?

47:12.997 --> 47:15.716
I can't make 9.
How about the afternoon?

47:15.916 --> 47:19.420
All right, 2, 3?

47:19.628 --> 47:23.223
I can't make the 22nd.
How about the 21 st?

47:23.424 --> 47:26.268
We have nothing open on the 21st.
Good night.

47:26.469 --> 47:28.016
Well, he wants me in a week.

47:28.220 --> 47:31.224
Well, another day or two won't matter.
How about the 24th?

47:31.432 --> 47:33.150
Fine. Oh, wait, no.
Go for 9?

47:33.351 --> 47:35.604
That's my colonoscopy prep day.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.404
That's always very special.

47:37.605 --> 47:40.404
Why don't you think about it
and call me?

47:45.905 --> 47:48.533
Before you go,
can you call Dr. Girsback

47:48.741 --> 47:51.665
and tell him I read the x-rays
and we can talk later?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.963
Sure.
No, no, no.

47:54.163 --> 47:56.040
When you're done,
when you're done.

47:56.248 --> 47:59.252
When you're finished.
Thank you.

48:02.505 --> 48:05.600
Are you feeling more
comfortable in the job?

48:05.800 --> 48:10.431
I hope you're pleased, because I
am determined to make it work.

48:10.638 --> 48:14.859
It fits in perfectly with my class.
Are you getting better on the computer?

48:15.059 --> 48:20.031
Well, I'm sure I'm the worst student
there, but another girl helps me, so...

48:20.231 --> 48:24.111
I'm glad you're relaxing
more into this job.

48:24.318 --> 48:25.228
I'm trying.

48:25.254 --> 48:28.894
Heh, I must say, I like
having you around.

48:29.073 --> 48:31.451
Thank you.
Since you started working here,

48:31.659 --> 48:35.380
have you noticed I've been wearing
more colorful neckties? Heh, heh.

48:35.788 --> 48:39.133
Since you-- I'm just-- Just joking.

48:39.333 --> 48:42.553
Can I--?
Can I make a confession?

48:42.837 --> 48:46.592
I don't know that I should be the
one to hear a confession, doctor.

48:46.757 --> 48:49.727
FLICKER:
Ha, ha, ha. Well... Ah.

48:50.302 --> 48:53.977
The way you dress,

48:54.265 --> 48:57.394
I sometimes find very...

48:58.060 --> 49:00.028
arousing.

49:00.229 --> 49:04.450
Really? I don't think I dress
in the slightest provocatively.

49:04.650 --> 49:09.372
Does it upset you if I tell you
that I, um, find you attractive?

49:09.572 --> 49:14.328
Dr. Flicker, where is all this talk leading?
Well, I'm not the kind of person

49:14.535 --> 49:18.836
who likes to beat around the bush.
I find you a very alluring woman.

49:19.039 --> 49:22.543
I'm flattered, but I certainly hope
that's not why you hired me.

49:22.751 --> 49:26.426
A certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me.

49:26.630 --> 49:29.383
I shouldn't be hearing this.
No, don't be upset.

49:29.592 --> 49:32.721
I'm not upset. Can I just grab my coat?
Don't be upset.

49:32.928 --> 49:37.149
Really, I think if you get to know me,
you'd come out of your shell more.

49:37.349 --> 49:38.396
I'm not in a shell.

49:38.601 --> 49:40.729
Ever gotten high on nitrous oxide?
No.

49:40.936 --> 49:44.110
It would remove your inhibitions.
I don't have inhibitions.

49:44.315 --> 49:45.407
Stop.
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.986
Stop being standoffish.
I'm not standoffish.

49:48.194 --> 49:50.743
You should be proud.
You've made a conquest.

49:50.946 --> 49:52.493
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

49:52.698 --> 49:55.201
This is so embarrassing.

49:55.367 --> 49:56.835
(BANGING AND CLANGING)

49:57.036 --> 49:59.255
I am never coming back here.

49:59.455 --> 50:03.210
I don't have to put myself
through this nonsense.

50:03.417 --> 50:05.761
I gotta take a deep breath.

50:05.961 --> 50:08.805
Oh, now look what you've done.
I can't breathe.

50:09.006 --> 50:11.179
Oh, God, I can't breathe.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.058
SHARON:
I don't blame you for being shaken up.

50:19.266 --> 50:23.146
I'd have that dentist reported.
If I told my boyfriend that story,

50:23.354 --> 50:27.029
he would go to the guy's office
and break every bone in his body.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.327
You can sue him.
That's harassment.

50:29.527 --> 50:32.076
No, I'm never going
into another courtroom.

50:32.279 --> 50:33.531
Ugh. I don't blame you.

50:33.739 --> 50:37.334
My boyfriend's a lawyer.
He's got court stories.

50:37.535 --> 50:40.960
Sharon, do you know any men?
Men?

50:42.206 --> 50:44.379
Men that would be
good for me.

50:44.583 --> 50:48.463
I just moved here,
so I don't really know anybody.

50:48.671 --> 50:52.892
If you can't fall in love in San Francisco,
you can't fall in love anywhere.

Well, what are you doing
Sunday afternoon?

50:59.056 --> 51:00.148
Not very much.

51:00.349 --> 51:02.602
Tony and I are going to a party.
Come with.

51:02.810 --> 51:06.531
Oh, no, no. I don't think I'm ready
for a big crowd of strangers.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.448
Oh, come on.

51:08.649 --> 51:12.699
It's a big bash someone's having.
There'll be all kinds of people.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.076
Make an effort,
otherwise nothing happens.

51:15.281 --> 51:17.842
Then you blame
everything but yourself.

51:17.868 --> 51:20.813
No, I want to. It's not
that I don't want to.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.874
Can I bring my sister?
For moral support? Absolutely.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.708
And Tony and I will be there.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.465
You'll have fun.
It's a huge party.

51:28.669 --> 51:30.637
Maybe you'll get lucky.

51:31.463 --> 51:34.763
But you have to come,
otherwise I'm not going.

Oh, we'll find you something.

socially in so long.

Sharon said there could be
some eligible men there.

I haven't been to a party in years.
You know, Chili hates them.

51:48.606 --> 51:53.032
Well, you know what I say to Chili.
It's hard to meet a man you can trust.

Hey, Nat.
What are you doing out here?

51:58.032 --> 52:01.662
I was having lunch in Southampton
and I wanted you to meet Amy Moore.

52:01.869 --> 52:04.338
Oh, hi. Hal Francis.
This is my wife. Honey?

52:04.538 --> 52:05.585
Jasmine.
Hello.

52:05.789 --> 52:10.010
Amy will be handling your contracts for
Empire Solutions and Global Innovations.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.804
She's brilliant. We couldn't
have done any better.

52:13.005 --> 52:15.849
We should get together
on that Empire Solutions thing.

52:16.050 --> 52:18.098
Free on Tuesday?
I'll make sure I am.

52:18.302 --> 52:19.394
That's great.

52:19.845 --> 52:22.394
Are you having an affair
with Amy?

52:23.057 --> 52:27.358
Amy, my lawyer?
Don't give me that. She's very pretty.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.780
HAL: Of course not. What
makes you think that?

52:29.980 --> 52:32.699
Someone made a remark.
What remark?

52:32.900 --> 52:36.279
They saw you having lunch with her.
Taking her hand.

52:36.487 --> 52:39.036
Oh, what crap. Who told you that?
I know who.

52:39.239 --> 52:41.958
That vacuous troublemaker Lydia, right?
Were you?

52:42.159 --> 52:44.912
I had a business lunch with Amy
at the Four Seasons.

52:45.120 --> 52:47.248
Lydia was there.
Did you take her hand?

52:47.456 --> 52:51.552
You think if I was having an affair,
I'd be crazy enough to have it in public?

52:51.752 --> 52:54.301
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes you drink at lunch.

52:54.505 --> 52:55.757
Maybe you were high.

52:55.964 --> 52:59.218
It's obvious she's got crush on you.
You're building a case.

52:59.426 --> 53:02.305
If you were having an affair,
I would be pretty upset.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.062
Well, I'm not,
so don't get your temper up.

53:05.265 --> 53:08.439
I'm just jealous because I love you.
You should be flattered.

53:08.644 --> 53:10.942
You know, I understand
other women have a--

53:11.146 --> 53:15.617
Find you attractive,
but it's their hard luck. I have you.

53:15.818 --> 53:18.367
Yes, you do.
No.

53:18.737 --> 53:20.705
So you're not?

53:21.907 --> 53:23.580
No, I'm not.

57:10.135 --> 57:14.060
I grew up in San Francisco.
I know California. I like challenges.

57:14.264 --> 57:15.311
You from out here?

57:15.682 --> 57:18.561
New York. Park Avenue.

57:18.769 --> 57:20.817
You know, when my husband
passed away,

57:21.021 --> 57:23.149
I mean, naturally
I was very upset,

57:23.357 --> 57:28.033
so I decided to come out here
and start a new life for myself.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.489
What did he do?

57:33.575 --> 57:35.452
He was a surgeon.

57:36.078 --> 57:40.333
Hm. God, that must be
incredibly stressful.

57:41.667 --> 57:45.638
No, I mean, he had a heart attack.
I'm sure that's what gave it to him.

57:46.338 --> 57:47.715
You have children?

57:48.840 --> 57:53.437
No, no.
No, there really wasn't time.

57:53.637 --> 57:57.517
And what about you? Hm? What do you do?
I guessed you were in the arts.

57:57.724 --> 58:00.352
Am I right?
Well, you're close.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.858
I am an interior designer.

58:03.438 --> 58:05.031
I really have hit the jackpot.

58:05.232 --> 58:07.360
Really?
I meet this exotic creature,

58:07.567 --> 58:10.320
not only is she charming
and elegant and single,

58:10.529 --> 58:12.702
but I just bought a new house.
Really?

58:12.906 --> 58:15.034
One I've been looking at.
It's in Marin.

58:15.242 --> 58:17.836
Overlooking the Bay. My dream house.
Beautiful.

58:18.036 --> 58:21.381
I meet this woman, and she turns
out to be an interior designer.

58:21.581 --> 58:23.925
Written in the stars.
You have to look at it.

58:24.126 --> 58:26.720
I would love to.
Maybe you can help me with it.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.422
Absolutely.

58:29.423 --> 58:32.552
GINGER: I never slept with anyone
the first night before, you know?

58:32.759 --> 58:35.433
Yeah, that--
But dancing with you

58:35.637 --> 58:38.356
got me all hot and bothered,
so, you know...

58:38.557 --> 58:39.854
AL:
Well, you were so sexy.

58:40.058 --> 58:43.562
I mean, I knew right away
that you were gonna be good in bed.

58:43.770 --> 58:44.896
I knew it.
Did you?

58:45.105 --> 58:46.903
I said to myself, you know...
Heh.

58:47.107 --> 58:50.111
You know, I thought for sure
we were gonna get caught.

58:50.318 --> 58:52.241
I didn't care. I mean, I--

58:52.446 --> 58:56.622
I couldn't wait. There's no way I was--
I had to have you right then and there.

58:56.825 --> 58:58.327
You know...

58:58.535 --> 59:00.708
You know what clinched it for me?
What?

59:00.912 --> 59:02.710
Because you were so smooth.

59:02.914 --> 59:05.793
Really?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

59:06.418 --> 59:09.763
Well, that's-- I just--
But, you know, I--

59:09.963 --> 59:13.433
I don't want you to think I'm
just easy, because I'm not.

59:13.633 --> 59:16.637
No, I-- You know what I think?
You're a fun-loving person.

59:16.845 --> 59:18.097
I am.
That's-- Yeah.

59:18.305 --> 59:19.807
Yeah.
And that's what I am.

59:20.015 --> 59:21.483
I can see that.
That's--

59:21.683 --> 59:23.435
I'm easygoing by nature.
Yeah.

59:23.643 --> 59:26.362
That's what I--
I bring music to people's lives.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.657
You're very sweet,
you know?

59:28.857 --> 59:31.781
I never had
a sweet guy before.

59:32.235 --> 59:33.282
I hope I--
Never.

59:33.487 --> 59:36.582
I hope I didn't get you in trouble
with your boyfriend.

59:36.782 --> 59:40.127
No. You know, it's not like
we're engaged, so...

59:40.327 --> 59:44.173
You know, I'm free. I'm free.
I'm glad to hear that.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.009
Oh, God,
I'd better get back.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.711
My lunch hour's
almost over.

59:48.919 --> 59:51.297
But we-- You know what?
We have time, though.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.803
For what?
Let's go in the back seat.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.429
Again?
Yeah, come on.

59:55.634 --> 59:57.511
Jesus, what are you?
It's just...

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.393
Are you one of those sex addicts?
I am for you. Come on.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:03.024
Ha, ha. Are you? I thought so.
One more.

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:04.977
Nobody's around.
Not many people.

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:09.031

I got tinted windows. It's perfect.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:21.661

I've got a throbbing headache.
You gave him both here

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:36.762
and your cell number?
Of course I gave him both numbers.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.345
Unless he's been delayed
in Washington.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:43.308
Still, he could have phoned.
Don't think he figured you were lying

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.815
and bailed out?
Look, could you stop saying I was lying?

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:51.273
God. Okay, I may have dressed up a few
facts, omitted a few unpleasant details,

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.655
but in the main, I mean,
my feelings, my ideas, my humor--

Were you at a party Sunday afternoon?
Who says?

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.182
I got a friend who's a bartender.
He saw you at a party.

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:26.733
So?
So you were dancing with a guy.

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:30.358
GINGER: So what?
I asked her to come with me, okay?

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:33.907
I was nervous about going to a party
where I didn't know anyone.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.781

were in the corner

I had a headache when you called.

you're fooling around with?

I told you, I didn't like you
rushing me into anything, okay?

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.816
Is seeing other guys her idea?
No, it's my idea.

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:11.862
I don't think it is. She thinks I'm a
bum, like your first husband, right?

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.939
You told me.
Guys, give me a break.

Oh. Yeah, that looks interesting.
It is, right?

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.311
Is that mid-19th century?

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:48.149
I have no idea.
Yeah. Well, no, all the pieces are here.

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:52.111
I do-- I love the posts,
but these beds, they're just--

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.070
Well, they're
not very wide.

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:58.329
Oh, yeah? Well, we're not very wide.
Oh, Dwight.

Yeah, yeah, whatever you think.
Well, it's not--

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:08.752
You know, last night
when we were making love,

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.179
I realized how removed
from the world

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:15.054
I've been since Andrea died.
I know, I know. I...

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:18.636
I think when something's right,
you just...

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:22.099
You know it immediately.
Oh, yeah?

Do you--? Do you hear that?
GINGER: Wow.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.256
Can you hear the bass, though?
Yeah.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:50.586
Like, the bass and then
the high-end definition.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:52.966
I'm definitely
gonna get one. Yup.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:55.344
I'm giving you this one.
No, you're not.

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.720
Yeah, I am.
Oh, my God. Heh, heh, heh.

01:08:57.925 --> 01:08:59.723
Come here.
You're so sweet.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:02.180
You're sweet.
You're sweet.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:05.733
You wanna dance?
Yeah.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:06.979
Isn't this dancing?

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:09.654
AL: Yeah, this is slow
dancing, which is really...

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:13.154
GINGER: What? Ha, ha, ha.
Well, it's the key, I always say

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:14.529
to good lovemaking.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.407
GINGER: Is that right?
Yeah.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:18.950
MATTHEW: Where do you
think Mom is tonight?

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:21.036
Oh, she's got a date tonight.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.368
Oh, that's cool.
I wonder where she is.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.750
Well, I don't think she's
at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.506
I'm gonna babysit you.
I'm a good babysitter.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.084
Yeah.
You know?

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.421
You should babysit. I used to
babysit when I was a teenager.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.221
It's how you make
extra money.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:39.426
Mom said you never did any work,
because you were so rich.

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:44.098
Well, I didn't know
what I wanted to become.

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:48.526
And Hal, my husband,
he swept me off my feet.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:52.656
"Blue Moon" was the song that was
playing. You know the song "Blue Moon."

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:56.109
Yeah, but I always wanted
to do something with my life.

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:58.870
You know, I had energy.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:02.283
I didn't just shop and lunch
and go to matinees.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.788
You know, I ran charities
for poor people

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:08.212
and, you know, raised some money
for museums and schools.

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:11.508
You know, with wealth
comes responsibilities.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:16.430
I wasn't just some mindless consumer
like so many of my so-called friends.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:20.099
Though I won't say
I dislike buying pretty clothes.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:22.393
Tip big, boys.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:27.724
Tip big, because you get good service
and they count on tips.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:31.152
You know, someday
when you come into great wealth,

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.354
you must remember
to be generous.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.783
Mom said you used to be okay,
but you got crazy.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:38.985
Yeah, and then you
talked to yourself.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:44.040
Well, there's only so many traumas
a person can withstand

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.619
until they take to the streets
and start screaming.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:53.299
That's right, boys, they picked me up
on the street talking to myself

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.298
and gave me something
called Edison's Medicine.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.254
Why Edison?

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:02.468
Because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight.

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.388
See, everything
unraveled so quickly.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:10.271
You know, I started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:12.477
and this acute fear of death.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:16.690
You know, I had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.993
I mean, you must have heard
of Prozac and lithium.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:23.367
Well, all those drugs
just made me worse.

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:28.331
Of course, you know,
I probably did suspect

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:32.539
that not everything Hal did
was always 100-percent aboveboard.

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:35.128
Christ, I mean,
you'd have to be an idiot

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.463
not to think his phenomenal success
was too good to be true. Heh, heh, heh.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.132
But a cheat is a cheat.

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:46.678
And when he had other women,
I just flipped out.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:50.060
You know, and one thing led
to another and...

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.476
But that's all history, boys.

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:56.938
I met someone.
I'm a new person.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:03.031
DWIGHT: Get everything?
Yes. These in the kitchen?

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:06.706
Sure.
I can't believe how much you paid for it.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:09.159
I know it's ridiculous
and it's old.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.290
God knows if it even works.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:15.590
We have the terrace for a telescope.
Watch the stars over San Francisco Bay.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:19.048
Mm. And the moon will
look incredible through it.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.005
Ever seen the moon through that?
Oh, I can imagine.

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:25.763
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.261
Sure.
You ever think

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:30.767
you could see yourself
married to me?

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:33.725
Married?

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:38.985
I have it all planned, but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:42.567
All right? But you come with me
next month to Vienna.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.699
We live there for a few years
and I can teach you to waltz.

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:48.907
And you can have all the chocolate
cake and wine you want.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:55.043
And then we come back and I get
serious about my political dream.

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:57.840
And then we adopt kids
and we live in the house

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.544
that you're gonna do such
a fantastic job making beautiful.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.971
What do you think? Downside for you
is you have to stand next to me

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:10.223
and smile at photo ops
when I throw my hat in the ring.

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:14.023
So you're saying you love me.
Can't you tell?

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:18.148
I hope I didn't cause you to become ill
over the prospect of being my wife.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:21.356
You know, sometimes I get
these headaches.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.942
You always take Xanax
for a headache?

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.735
I'll admit, my heart's
beating a little fast.

01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:28.726
Yeah. Ooh, your
hands are shaking.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:31.658
I wanted you to want me
and now you do.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.788
Thank you so much.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:40.796
Have a nice day. You got it?
Okay, I'll take that.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.049
What are you doing here?
You know why I'm here.

01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:47.265
I told you not to bother me.
You're sleeping with Al.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.467
You're not gonna make
a fool out of me.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:52.599
Chili, this is not the place
to discuss this, okay?

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:54.476
Sir, is there a problem?
Sorry.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.897
No, there's no problem.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:59.477
Ginger, Ginger, I love you.
Ginger, what's going on?

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:00.982
What happened?
Nothing.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:04.657
No, I just need a-- Just need a
break from everything to think.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:08.987
All right, look, I blame this on Jasmine.
No, she's just looking out for me.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:12.039
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you,
okay? I don't like her.

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.617
You meant nothing to her
until she needed you.

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:17.795
I'm working, Chili.
I'm nuts about you, Ging.

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:21.875
I'm nuts about you. We're gonna do
all these things together, big things.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:24.552
What great things, huh?
You're a grease monkey.

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:29.303
And I'll be bagging groceries all my life.
She's cuckoo, baby. She talks to herself.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.680
You told me that yourself.
I need space.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:34.137
Just give me some space,
okay?

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.439
I can't sleep.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.272
I'm a nervous wreck.
Oh, for chrissake.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.820
I can't get you off of my head.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.320
Stop it. Will you stop crying?
There's people around.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:48.743
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.069
Oh, my God.
CHILI: I don't.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:52.655
Stop it. Stop it, please.
I got this, okay?

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:56.117
Would you like to sit in my office?
No. But I appreciate it.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.794
Look, who's this guy, Al?

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.464
What does he do?
You know what he doesn't do?

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.713
He doesn't make scenes
where I work in public.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.921
Come on, brother.
Would you like a Kleenex?

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:12.008
I love her so much.
It's okay. There's nothing to see, okay?

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:13.593
Great.

01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:22.772
Hello.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:30.406
Hello.
Hi.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:33.029
Hi.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.406
You seem up.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:39.164
He's taking me to pick out
an engagement ring tomorrow.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.875
Wow. How great.
What's that smell?

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:44.798
Did you break a bottle of perfume?
Oh.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:47.801
Al doesn't call it perfume,
he calls it a fragrance.

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.754
That's sweet.
But if I may say,

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:53.341
you may have doused yourself
a little over-abundantly with it.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.678
GINGER: God, I'm always
nervous it will wear off.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:59.435
He's taking me
to his favorite jeweler.

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:01.766
You think Al is a
step up from Chili?

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:04.727
JASMINE: Anybody
is a step up from Chili.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:06.482
He's such a gentleman.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:09.611
Well, then he's definitely
a step up.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:12.568
GINGER: But in bed,
he's no gentleman.

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:15.656
Wait till he takes a whiff
of my new fragrance.

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:17.581
It's French.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:27.083
MAN: Yeah, I'm on my way. Yeah,
I'm on my way over right now.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:30.090
NORA: You're late.
Oh, God.

01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:34.299
I'm still shaking. What-S the matter?

01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:39.016
I think Hal is having an affair.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.978
With Lisette Boudreau?

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.727
Who is she?

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:50.531
That French girl.
The Jordans' au pair.

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.697
What do you know
about this?

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:56.574
You're the only one who doesn't know.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:17:00.875
I've known about Hal's affairs for years,
but it's not my business.

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:02.789
How did you find out?

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:07.507
The Ritz Hotel in Paris called.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:09.925
Hal left his Rolex there.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.881
But he told me that he was going
on a business trip to Chicago.

01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:16.386
If he'd said Paris,
I would've gone along,

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:20.845
and I didn't know what they were talking
about, so I did some checking and...

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:23.351
I knew this day would come.

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:26.476
I'm surprised it took so long.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.691
Who else?

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.070
Victoria Alter.

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:36.827
Raylene.

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:47.637
Just, please,
don't spoil everything.

01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:50.685
Just get out of my life
so I can move on.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.144
Heh, heh, heh.
Definitely. Heh, heh.

01:29:56.683 --> 01:29:57.775
GINGER: Hey.
CHILI: Hey.

01:29:57.976 --> 01:30:00.980
GINGER: Hey,
have some champagne.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:04.445
Chili brought some over
to celebrate.

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.697
We're back together.
Heh, heh, heh.

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:10.952
I'm sorry, I'm not
in a celebratory mood.

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:14.376
I don't think I'd find that news
anything to celebrate about.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:17.580
Hey, come on, Jasmine,
let's not dig at each other, okay?

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:20.666
I'm moving in, and she tells me
you found a rich husband.

01:30:20.874 --> 01:30:23.377
Gonna be a big shot in Washington.
We made up.

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:25.178
CHILI:
She begged for my forgiveness.

01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:27.806
GINGER: And he cried like
a baby and apologized.

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:32.933
CHILI: I didn't cry.
Bullshit. You cry all the time.

01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:35.309
But we're moving in.

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:39.393
It's something we planned for a long
time and maybe if we'd just done it--

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:42.104
Oh, for chrissake.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:44.781
What's wrong with
your self-esteem?

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:48.986
There's men who'd never think
about ripping the phone out of the wall.

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:52.744
Hey, leave him alone.
You're always picking on him.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:54.871
No, you choose losers, okay?

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:57.373
Because that's what you think
you deserve.

01:30:57.577 --> 01:31:01.957
That's why you're living like this and
that's why you'll never have a better life.

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:04.380
I'm-- I'm living--

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:10.341
I'm living like this because
you married the biggest loser of all

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:12.846
and went your own sweet way

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:18.603
while he pissed away my one big
chance to make a better life.

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:21.310
Come on, let's not ruin
our celebration, okay?

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:25.193
Come on, she's happy, we're happy.
Let's let sleeping dogs lie.

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:28.867
He's right. I'm not gonna be
drawn into defending myself

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:32.913
when all I wanted to do
was bring you in on a good deal.

01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:38.043
I'm moving out of
this place today.

01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:40.708
I just gotta get
myself together.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:45.418
Dwight asked me to move in with
him, as I expected he would.

01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:47.798
He wants me to finish
decorating his home.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.552
Then we'll marry and
we'll move in together.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:53.679
He's one of these men
who's lost without a woman.

01:31:53.883 --> 01:31:56.887
It has to be the right woman,
who's a plus for his career.

01:31:57.095 --> 01:32:01.521
And I have the social skills
required for his future in politics.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:05.896
For the next few years,
we'll be living in Vienna.

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:09.574
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:11.617
I'll send for my luggage.

01:32:11.818 --> 01:32:14.241
(♪♪)

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:19.577
I was pretty angry at some of the things
she said, but I kept it on the inside.

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:25.629
I'm tired of her knocking you.
You know?

01:32:26.124 --> 01:32:28.718
(♪♪)

(CROWD CHEERING ON TV)

01:32:34.466 --> 01:32:36.844
Don't even think about taking
that last slice of pizza.

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:40.647
What? Why?
That's my slice of pizza. Don't take it.

01:32:40.847 --> 01:32:43.225
Oh. Is it really?
Last slice belongs to the man.

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:46.733
You're putting too much on the hips.
Is that so?

01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:49.940
Yeah, if you wanna keep me around--
This slice is yours?

01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:54.654
Don't touch it. Ginger, I swear to God.
Is this yours? Is this yours?

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:57.413
Ah! Ah!
That slice of pizza is mine.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:32:59.370
(GINGER LAUGHING)

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:01.250
CHILI: That's mine.
GINGER: Yeah.

01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:03.579
CHILI: That's mine. That's mine.
GINGER: Ha, ha, ha.

01:33:03.787 --> 01:33:06.586
CHILI: Oh, that's mine.
Those are definitely mine.

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:08.963
GINGER: Is that yours?
CHILI: Mm-hm.

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:10.752
GINGER: Yeah?
CHILI: Mm-hm.

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:14.506
GINGER: Yeah,
that's yours, okay.

01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:35.698
It's fraught with peril.

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:39.573
They gossip, you know,
they talk.

01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:43.542
I saw Danny.

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:46.121
Yes, did I tell you?

01:33:47.372 --> 01:33:49.591
He's getting married.

01:33:51.668 --> 01:33:55.172
A weekend in Palm Beach
means I can wear...

01:33:55.380 --> 01:34:00.352
What could I wear? I can wear
the Dior dress I bought in Paris.

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:04.390
Yes, my black dress.

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:07.726
Well, Hal always used to surprise me
with jewelry.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.779
Extravagant pieces.

01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:14.153
I think he used to buy
them at auction.

01:34:16.568 --> 01:34:19.287
It's so obvious what you're doing.

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.198
You think I don't know.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.084
French au pair.

This was playing on the Vineyard.

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:37.885
"Blue Moon."

01:34:41.384 --> 01:34:43.978
I used to know the words.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:48.308
I knew the words.

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:53.071
Now they're all a jumble.
