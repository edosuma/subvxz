00:47.760 --> 00:50.194
<i>Four hundred years ago,</i>

00:50.196 --> 00:52.499
<i>God delivered us
to this Promised Land.</i>

00:53.567 --> 00:55.767
<i>But as the years passed,</i>

00:55.769 --> 01:00.538
<i>many of our tribes forgot
and turned their backs to God.</i>

01:00.540 --> 01:05.175
<i>When the Philistines came,
they found us weak, divided,</i>

01:05.177 --> 01:07.447
<i>and they enslaved our people.</i>

01:08.281 --> 01:11.181
<i>Our only hope was a prophecy</i>

01:11.183 --> 01:13.417
<i>that a man would be born,</i>

01:13.419 --> 01:17.525
<i>one who would rise up
and set our people free.</i>

01:28.201 --> 01:32.402
O Great Dagon,
lord of battles,

01:32.404 --> 01:36.340
bestower of wealth
and bountiful harvests,

01:36.342 --> 01:40.512
look upon your people,
the Philistines of Gaza.

01:41.481 --> 01:44.249
We are gathered here
at your feet

01:44.251 --> 01:48.452
to bring you gifts gathered
by the hands of the Hebrews

01:48.454 --> 01:51.556
- who gave unto us...
- Move. Move.

01:51.558 --> 01:53.494
to conquer and command!

01:54.594 --> 01:58.630
Look how easily the Hebrews
forsake their god

01:58.632 --> 02:00.565
and serve Dagon.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.671
They grew this food...

02:40.973 --> 02:42.907
Throw away the outside.

02:42.909 --> 02:46.611
Cook the inside,
then eat the outside.

02:46.613 --> 02:47.613
What is it?

02:49.381 --> 02:52.316
What approaches with a stalk
but has ears that cannot hear?

02:52.318 --> 02:55.687
That riddle's almost as bad
as this plan, Brother.

02:57.389 --> 02:58.726
Move along!

03:16.542 --> 03:19.711
What has flesh but no blood
and a heart made of stone?

03:19.713 --> 03:22.715
You talking about
the olives or Father?

03:23.983 --> 03:25.850
Hey! Hebrew!

03:25.852 --> 03:27.417
What are you
doing back there?

03:27.419 --> 03:30.821
I'm, uh...
I'm waiting for my master.

03:30.823 --> 03:32.589
He prays in the temple.

03:32.591 --> 03:34.524
Samson, what's happening?

03:34.526 --> 03:36.728
Then why do
you hide your face?

03:36.730 --> 03:38.262
Remove your hood.

03:38.264 --> 03:40.431
Hey, Brother.

03:40.433 --> 03:41.699
Hebrew, show yourself.

03:41.701 --> 03:43.603
Samson,
what's happening there?

03:45.537 --> 03:46.537
Brother.

03:49.409 --> 03:50.707
I know him.

03:50.709 --> 03:53.645
That's Samson, the Hebrew
strongman from the pits.

03:53.647 --> 03:55.179
Be very careful.

03:55.181 --> 03:58.749
You're coming with us. We'll find your
master, see if you're telling the truth.

03:58.751 --> 04:00.417
Of course.

04:00.419 --> 04:02.623
Why would I resist?

04:04.657 --> 04:05.758
Aah!

04:11.864 --> 04:13.433
Samson!

04:14.667 --> 04:15.667
Samson!

04:18.637 --> 04:21.338
Thieves!
Thieves in the temple!

04:21.339 --> 04:23.740
The harder to catch,
the faster I run.

04:23.742 --> 04:25.643
- What am I?
- Too easy.

04:25.645 --> 04:26.814
Your breath.

04:33.386 --> 04:36.653
The eyes of Dagon
see you for what you are.

04:36.655 --> 04:39.660
You shall not escape
his wrath.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.059
He will crush you

04:42.061 --> 04:44.728
and all who defy him.

04:44.730 --> 04:47.467
- This way!
- Don't let them escape.

04:49.768 --> 04:51.405
Stop him, you fool!

05:05.085 --> 05:07.621
No!

05:09.955 --> 05:11.021
No!

05:11.023 --> 05:12.689
No!

05:17.063 --> 05:18.766
Come. This way.

05:27.140 --> 05:29.376
Come back here!

05:33.545 --> 05:35.946
This way to the gate.

05:35.948 --> 05:38.148
Where are you going?
It's this way.

05:38.150 --> 05:39.650
Thieves!

05:39.652 --> 05:41.085
- Thieves!
- Split up!

05:41.087 --> 05:42.589
There they go!

05:44.056 --> 05:45.956
There's nowhere
to run, Hebrew!

06:03.809 --> 06:06.511
Morning, ladies.

06:06.513 --> 06:08.946
- What do we have here?
- There he is!

06:08.948 --> 06:10.848
Thief!

06:10.850 --> 06:12.182
I'll be right back.

06:12.184 --> 06:14.418
This should only take a moment.
Come on!

06:14.420 --> 06:17.655
Come back here. Come back here.

06:19.758 --> 06:20.992
Oh!

06:20.994 --> 06:22.427
What happened to you?

06:22.429 --> 06:24.629
Let's never
speak of this.

06:24.631 --> 06:26.497
- There! There he is!
- Go!

06:26.499 --> 06:27.979
- Come back here.
- This way, Brother.

06:37.509 --> 06:39.645
Thieves! Come back!

07:00.499 --> 07:01.799
Hebrews!

07:01.801 --> 07:04.067
If this month's tribute
falls short,

07:04.069 --> 07:05.805
next month's will be double!

07:11.677 --> 07:12.980
Get out!

07:14.547 --> 07:16.948
I know you have more!
Where is it?

07:16.950 --> 07:17.950
No. Stop.

07:25.624 --> 07:28.595
- Where's Samson?
- He will be here.

07:40.073 --> 07:41.575
Please.

07:42.242 --> 07:44.578
Show mercy, my lord.

07:49.749 --> 07:52.682
And what form
should my mercy take?

07:52.684 --> 07:56.920
The tribute,
it is too much, my lord.

07:56.922 --> 08:01.627
We starve while our wheat
grows mold in your barns.

08:02.729 --> 08:05.999
Can you not spare us
a little more, my lord?

08:15.141 --> 08:17.141
What is your name, Hebrew?

08:17.143 --> 08:20.311
My name is Tobias, my lord.

08:20.313 --> 08:22.516
Tobias.

08:24.951 --> 08:27.251
I, Prince Rallah,

08:27.253 --> 08:30.288
have heard this man's cry.

08:30.290 --> 08:34.528
And as commander
of the Philistine army...

08:35.561 --> 08:37.227
I declare henceforth

08:37.230 --> 08:40.868
this man shall
never hunger again.

08:43.869 --> 08:44.901
Aah!

08:55.214 --> 08:58.785
Does anyone else desire mercy?

09:13.265 --> 09:15.065
Back to work.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.936
Back to work!

09:25.110 --> 09:27.914
You mean
you wish, little brother.

09:33.385 --> 09:36.820
Another man died today.

09:36.822 --> 09:40.927
Tobias was killed
by the Philistine commander.

09:48.201 --> 09:51.736
You were called by God,

09:51.738 --> 09:55.305
gifted with his power,
to deliver his people.

09:55.307 --> 09:59.377
The council think it's his time
for a judge to be anointed.

09:59.379 --> 10:02.780
We do not need a judge.
We need peace.

10:02.782 --> 10:07.184
Remember the prophecy,
Samson of the tribe of Dan,

10:07.186 --> 10:09.219
chosen by the living God

10:09.221 --> 10:12.923
to be his hand
of vengeance.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.224
It's his will.

10:14.226 --> 10:16.426
But it is not mine.

10:16.428 --> 10:19.162
Son, you are not like
other Hebrews.

10:19.164 --> 10:21.064
You're meant for so much more.
You were...

10:21.066 --> 10:24.801
You never fail
to remind me of this.

10:24.803 --> 10:27.405
Everything God has required
of me, I have done.

10:27.407 --> 10:29.272
I kept every vow.

10:29.274 --> 10:31.242
No wine.
No touching the dead.

10:31.244 --> 10:33.710
No cutting of my hair.
And where has it gotten me?

10:33.712 --> 10:36.414
Where has it gotten us?

10:36.416 --> 10:38.882
Are we free from rule?
Do we have peace?

10:38.884 --> 10:41.785
Why does God withhold
what we desire?

10:41.787 --> 10:45.124
Samson, you must not
forget who you are.

10:47.793 --> 10:50.261
The silos are half full
after the tribute today.

10:50.263 --> 10:53.233
Tomorrow, we will fill
the remainder from Accra.

10:57.202 --> 10:59.203
Is that all?

10:59.205 --> 11:01.304
There are whispers

11:01.306 --> 11:03.741
of a Hebrew
with great strength.

11:03.743 --> 11:06.810
His people believe him
to be a savior,

11:06.812 --> 11:09.015
but it is a story
of the slaves, nothing more.

11:10.249 --> 11:12.219
Stories.

11:13.452 --> 11:14.984
Stories
are possibilities,

11:14.986 --> 11:17.221
and possibilities are hope.

11:17.223 --> 11:20.927
And hope...
hope is rebellion.

11:21.860 --> 11:23.794
I want you to investigate this.

11:23.796 --> 11:26.830
Should I not be doing something more
than keeping watch over slaves?

11:26.832 --> 11:29.199
You think this
is beneath you?

11:29.201 --> 11:30.501
But, Father...

11:30.503 --> 11:34.137
In matters of the crown,
do not call me father.

11:34.139 --> 11:36.073
I'm your king.

11:36.075 --> 11:38.045
Do as I say.

11:39.479 --> 11:41.181
Yes, my king.

11:43.249 --> 11:44.249
Now.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.962
Don't even think about it.

12:06.873 --> 12:08.709
What's happening?

12:09.508 --> 12:11.842
Samson.

12:11.844 --> 12:13.978
The Philistines
have a new fighter.

12:13.980 --> 12:17.080
Bolcom from Egypt.
He can't be beaten.

12:17.082 --> 12:20.052
He mocks our people,
and he mocks our God.

12:21.186 --> 12:23.987
- But you can show him.
- Samson's not interested.

12:23.989 --> 12:26.058
Our father's given us...

12:27.259 --> 12:29.059
Pathetic!

12:29.061 --> 12:32.429
I have fought men
from every land!

12:32.431 --> 12:35.399
These Hebrews
and their puny god

12:35.401 --> 12:37.300
are like fighting children!

12:37.302 --> 12:39.569
Send two against me!

12:39.571 --> 12:43.973
God Dagon
guarantees many returns!

12:43.975 --> 12:46.278
Support your
Hebrew fighters.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.481
A hundred manehs.

12:50.483 --> 12:52.786
Let the fighting begin!

13:01.093 --> 13:04.495
Brother, think.

13:04.497 --> 13:07.864
Why would they bring this
monster if not to draw you out?

13:07.866 --> 13:09.368
Something's not right here.

13:11.103 --> 13:13.036
I'm just gonna
take a look.

13:13.038 --> 13:15.107
What's the harm in that?

13:16.408 --> 13:18.575
The last time you said that,
I cracked two of my...

13:25.518 --> 13:27.184
Father.

13:27.186 --> 13:30.186
The fights turn my stomach.
Can I please be excused?

13:30.188 --> 13:34.324
There are many fine nobles
here with deep pockets.

13:34.326 --> 13:36.327
Mingle with them, hmm?

13:36.329 --> 13:38.364
And try to smile.

13:43.970 --> 13:47.070
You people are weak!

13:47.072 --> 13:51.242
And you serve an even weaker god!

13:51.244 --> 13:53.978
Our God is not weak.

13:53.980 --> 13:56.347
- And neither are his people.
- Look. Samson.

13:56.349 --> 13:57.383
Samson.

13:58.551 --> 14:00.483
Ooh!

14:00.485 --> 14:03.155
The Hebrew champion.

14:04.657 --> 14:07.891
A bag of silver
for the victor!

14:07.893 --> 14:09.359
Only one?

14:09.361 --> 14:11.964
Do you have such little faith
in your god?

14:14.066 --> 14:17.870
All right.
Two bags of silver then.

14:19.071 --> 14:20.971
Samson,
Father will be furious.

14:20.973 --> 14:23.073
Brother,
are you listening?

14:23.075 --> 14:25.979
10-to-1!

14:30.081 --> 14:32.382
Bolcom! Bolcom! Bolcom!

14:32.384 --> 14:34.053
Bolcom! Bolcom!

14:48.701 --> 14:51.035
Bets are closed.

14:51.037 --> 14:53.373
Let the fighting begin!

14:57.409 --> 14:58.541
Brother.

14:58.543 --> 15:00.310
Are you all right?

15:00.312 --> 15:03.247
Find out who she is,
and I will be.

15:03.249 --> 15:05.348
Bolcom! Bolcom!

15:05.350 --> 15:07.351
Bolcom! Bolcom!

15:07.353 --> 15:08.455
Bolcom! Bolcom!

15:09.721 --> 15:13.290
Bolcom! Bolcom! Bolcom!

15:13.292 --> 15:15.425
Bolcom! Bolcom!

15:15.427 --> 15:17.227
Bolcom! Bolcom!

15:17.229 --> 15:20.631
Where is your
Hebrew champion now, huh?

15:20.633 --> 15:24.568
Dagon has proven his power!

15:24.570 --> 15:26.306
And I have proven mine!

15:36.715 --> 15:40.486
God, give me
your strength.

15:42.587 --> 15:45.090
My name is Samson.

15:46.359 --> 15:48.492
My name is Samson,

15:48.494 --> 15:50.964
and I serve the living God.

15:55.234 --> 15:58.204
And you have proven nothing.

16:06.244 --> 16:08.078
Yield. The silver is yours.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.580
Just... Just put the rock down.

16:10.582 --> 16:12.248
Samson! Samson!

16:12.250 --> 16:14.220
Samson!

16:20.792 --> 16:22.461
Yeah!

16:42.114 --> 16:45.585
Father,
look what Samson did.

16:46.752 --> 16:48.819
I heard.

16:48.821 --> 16:51.124
You can take it
to the council.

16:52.657 --> 16:55.358
But he won these for us.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.364
Would you feast if the
rest of us were starving?

16:59.264 --> 17:01.033
Your brother's
becoming arrogant.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.233
He's doing
what he sees as right.

17:04.236 --> 17:09.175
He only sees what's right
in front of him, that's all.

17:14.246 --> 17:17.282
Halt!
Halt for the prince.

17:21.554 --> 17:25.122
Well, if it is not the greatest
fighter riches can buy.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.157
Shh.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.593
Lord, you hired us
to draw him out.

17:29.595 --> 17:31.597
We never promised victory.

17:32.631 --> 17:33.631
Right.

17:34.599 --> 17:35.798
Right you are.

17:39.771 --> 17:41.471
You there.

17:41.473 --> 17:45.476
Your master has cost me
quite a lot today.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.381
- My lord...
- Hold your tongue, or I shall have it cut from your mouth.

17:51.150 --> 17:52.716
Does this bother you?

17:52.718 --> 17:55.455
The riches your master
has cost me?

17:57.456 --> 17:59.259
I guess not.

17:59.825 --> 18:00.858
Very well.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.861
You will enter my service
until your debt is paid.

18:03.863 --> 18:06.466
Well...
not all of you.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.470
Aah!

18:17.643 --> 18:18.842
Rumor is true.

18:18.844 --> 18:23.846
I saw him lift a boulder the
size of an ox without strain.

18:23.848 --> 18:25.484
The Hebrew god is in him.

18:26.652 --> 18:29.519
- Within him?
- Yes.

18:29.521 --> 18:31.688
What is he then?
Is he a half-god?

18:32.924 --> 18:35.494
If gods were mortal,
he would be one.

18:37.363 --> 18:39.897
- You forget whose kingdom you inhabit.
- Yes.

18:39.899 --> 18:42.199
Our god Dagon is mighty.

18:42.201 --> 18:43.901
Yes, he is.

18:43.903 --> 18:46.372
Would you kindly
give us some privacy?

18:52.577 --> 18:53.577
Sit.

18:59.919 --> 19:02.255
This is not
Dagon's kingdom.

19:02.654 --> 19:04.257
'Tis mine.

19:05.257 --> 19:08.558
You must see gods
for what they are.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.329
They are symbols.

19:11.297 --> 19:12.795
They have no power.

19:12.797 --> 19:17.601
To the common man, they
provide something bigger.

19:17.603 --> 19:21.274
To us, they are
means of control.

19:21.941 --> 19:23.907
I am Dagon.

19:23.909 --> 19:28.378
You can be Dagon if you stomp out
this fire before it becomes a blaze.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.314
Yes, my king.

19:31.316 --> 19:32.783
You may return!

19:32.785 --> 19:36.288
- He will serve the crown or he will die.
- I'm sure he will.

19:42.428 --> 19:44.428
How did I know
I'd find you here?

19:44.430 --> 19:46.563
This is the best view
in all of Israel.

19:46.565 --> 19:48.465
You should turn your eyes and
mind towards things that matter.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.566
I am appreciating
God's creation.

19:50.568 --> 19:52.603
What could possibly
be more important than that?

19:52.605 --> 19:56.305
- Fulfilling your destiny? Becoming judge?
- No, there is no judge.

19:56.307 --> 19:59.311
- You carry the anointing.
- But I'm not ready.

20:00.613 --> 20:02.448
You're never ready.

20:04.415 --> 20:05.983
What are you
smiling at?

20:05.985 --> 20:07.787
I found her.

20:09.454 --> 20:12.389
Oh, little brother,
now this is good news.

20:12.391 --> 20:14.391
Her name is Taren.
She's in Gaza.

20:14.393 --> 20:17.593
- And even worse, she's a servant a Rallah.
- I must relieve her of that.

20:17.595 --> 20:19.329
- No, you must not.
- No, I must.

20:19.331 --> 20:20.730
- And one more thing.
- What?

20:20.732 --> 20:23.335
You must
not tell Mother.

21:09.914 --> 21:12.284
Is everything all right?

21:14.819 --> 21:17.054
Forgive me. I just...

21:17.056 --> 21:20.056
Just what?
You enjoy spying on people?

21:20.058 --> 21:21.527
No.

21:22.661 --> 21:25.961
Not at all. I just had
to know who you were.

21:25.963 --> 21:30.833
After seeing you at the
fight, my head was spinning.

21:30.835 --> 21:33.103
Are you sure that was not
because of his punch?

21:33.105 --> 21:35.604
No.

21:35.606 --> 21:38.810
The only reason he landed that punch
was because I was distracted.

21:39.812 --> 21:40.812
By you.

21:43.915 --> 21:48.751
They say that those who tangle with
you leave wishing they had not.

21:50.122 --> 21:51.921
The prince.

21:51.923 --> 21:53.122
I must go.

21:53.124 --> 21:55.525
Wait. Do you know
the cliffs by the beach?

21:55.527 --> 21:57.960
Near the path
where Gaza meets the sea?

21:57.962 --> 21:59.795
Yes.

21:59.797 --> 22:01.667
They are beautiful.

22:06.537 --> 22:08.775
Meet me there tomorrow
at first light.

22:09.874 --> 22:11.576
Please?

22:15.847 --> 22:19.615
How long must we wait for God
to deliver us from this oppression?

22:19.617 --> 22:23.487
He has already revealed
his chosen one. It is Samson.

22:23.489 --> 22:25.988
Well, where is he then?
He should be here.

22:25.990 --> 22:27.724
Samson does not want
to be judge.

22:27.726 --> 22:30.927
It is better this way.
He is unfit to lead.

22:30.929 --> 22:33.596
How can God choose a barbarian

22:33.598 --> 22:36.699
that chases after a woman
like it is his birthright?

22:36.701 --> 22:38.067
And may I add,

22:38.069 --> 22:41.438
I'm grateful he has eyes for the
Philistine maidens and not our women.

22:41.440 --> 22:45.741
At least there is a slight chance my own
sister will be safe from his advances.

22:45.743 --> 22:47.943
Your sister would not
have her virtue

22:47.945 --> 22:50.714
if not for the protection
given by my brother.

22:50.716 --> 22:54.083
Would you have him remove it from you?
From her?

22:54.085 --> 22:56.018
From all of you?

23:03.929 --> 23:06.399
I was beginning to
wonder if you would show.

23:07.165 --> 23:09.466
I used to play here
as a child.

23:09.468 --> 23:11.504
Walk along the water
with my father.

23:12.637 --> 23:14.704
It's actually the only reason
I chose to come.

23:14.706 --> 23:18.041
Oh, is that so?

23:18.043 --> 23:20.544
Yes, that is so.

23:20.546 --> 23:22.179
Do you consider me a liar?

23:22.181 --> 23:24.781
No, I'm not saying
you were lying.

23:24.783 --> 23:26.917
I mean, is that
the only reason?

23:26.919 --> 23:28.653
There is no other?

23:29.787 --> 23:32.557
Well, if you must know
the entire truth...

23:33.724 --> 23:34.759
then yes.

23:38.831 --> 23:41.934
Are you coming or not?

23:46.572 --> 23:49.206
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

23:49.208 --> 23:51.475
Do you believe in destiny?

23:51.477 --> 23:55.946
That your life can be decided for
you even before you're born.

23:55.948 --> 23:57.784
Yes, I do.

23:59.183 --> 24:00.683
Well, I do not.

24:00.685 --> 24:04.554
I refuse to be bound
by slavery of any kind.

24:04.556 --> 24:07.023
What about me
and <i>my</i> people?

24:07.025 --> 24:10.994
Are we not slaves to your
people, the Philistines?

24:10.996 --> 24:13.766
We do not have the freedom
that you speak of.

24:15.033 --> 24:17.667
Our lives are our own.

24:17.669 --> 24:19.705
Our destiny
is what we make of it.

24:20.873 --> 24:23.907
You're only a slave
if you let them make you one.

24:23.909 --> 24:28.714
If you think that your current situation
is any different than mine...

24:29.647 --> 24:31.716
well, you're wrong.

24:39.857 --> 24:41.757
<i>Tell me of your family.</i>

24:41.759 --> 24:45.128
<i>My mother was killed
when I was only a child,</i>

24:45.130 --> 24:49.099
and the prince has enslaved my
father until his debt is paid.

24:49.101 --> 24:51.234
I'm sorry.

24:51.236 --> 24:54.607
Your people are not
the only victims.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.208
All my life it's been said
that I'm meant to lead my people

24:59.210 --> 25:01.844
to victory
against the Philistines.

25:01.846 --> 25:02.879
Us?

25:02.881 --> 25:05.614
My brethren
are beaten, starved.

25:05.616 --> 25:07.918
Our livestock is stolen.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.054
This has gone on for years,
Taren, with no end in sight.

25:11.056 --> 25:13.992
Samson, we are enslaved
by the same people.

25:16.094 --> 25:18.631
Who do you want to be?

25:19.264 --> 25:20.700
Father.

25:22.034 --> 25:23.536
Husband.

25:28.707 --> 25:31.576
I believe you
can be that man.

26:05.978 --> 26:08.143
Troubled?

26:08.145 --> 26:10.080
When the old man dies,

26:10.082 --> 26:13.949
should I declare a time of mourning
for the passing of a king?

26:13.951 --> 26:18.654
Or a time of celebration
for the coronation of a new one?

26:18.656 --> 26:21.026
Do you expect
this tragedy soon?

26:22.728 --> 26:25.362
It does not matter.

26:25.364 --> 26:28.768
I will be rejoicing
regardless.

26:31.970 --> 26:34.670
He thinks me unprepared
for the crown,

26:34.672 --> 26:38.708
and he'll task me with the act of
suppressing a slave rebellion.

26:38.710 --> 26:41.177
It is a fool's errand.

26:41.179 --> 26:44.913
I should be leading armies
into Sidon, Media, and Egypt.

26:44.915 --> 26:49.185
These Hebrews are not worth
the time of a future king.

26:49.187 --> 26:50.656
My father.

26:51.989 --> 26:54.356
He grows senile
in his old age.

26:54.358 --> 26:56.861
He's led our kingdom
into prosperity.

26:58.396 --> 27:00.966
Perhaps he deserves
more honor.

27:04.001 --> 27:08.705
Perhaps your prince
deserves more respect.

27:08.707 --> 27:10.774
You need more wine.

27:10.776 --> 27:13.410
If you wish to serve
as my queen,

27:13.412 --> 27:17.616
you will learn
to tame your tongue.

27:19.284 --> 27:22.021
Of course, my love.

27:23.855 --> 27:26.959
The throne
will be ours soon.

27:28.259 --> 27:30.095
My Delilah.

27:44.442 --> 27:46.141
<i>Why can't we show everyone</i>

27:46.143 --> 27:49.312
<i>how Hebrews and Philistines
can live in peace?</i>

27:49.314 --> 27:53.349
For the first time in my life,
someone asked who I want to be.

27:53.351 --> 27:57.189
You make me believe in a future
I did not think I could have.

27:58.289 --> 27:59.722
Samson.

27:59.724 --> 28:02.861
This is our chance to be free.

28:06.264 --> 28:08.064
Taren.

28:08.066 --> 28:09.701
Marry me.

28:13.471 --> 28:16.072
Your parents
will not approve of it.

28:16.074 --> 28:19.776
If you say yes,
I will stop at nothing

28:19.778 --> 28:22.748
until they give me
their blessing.

28:23.749 --> 28:25.148
Then yes.

28:25.150 --> 28:26.951
Yes? Yes?

28:40.132 --> 28:41.132
Oh!

28:46.104 --> 28:47.972
I met a girl.

28:48.874 --> 28:50.875
I want to marry her.

28:52.410 --> 28:54.811
Uh, what's her name?

28:54.813 --> 28:57.083
Her name is Taren.

28:57.848 --> 28:59.882
Fro... From our village?

28:59.884 --> 29:02.919
No, she is from Timna.

29:02.921 --> 29:05.487
A Hebrew girl in Timna?

29:05.489 --> 29:07.791
Who's her father?

29:07.793 --> 29:10.763
His name is Aha. He's a
prisoner of the crown.

29:12.130 --> 29:16.932
You couldn't find a suitable
bride in our own tribe?

29:16.934 --> 29:20.570
Instead you choose
a daughter of the enemy?

29:20.572 --> 29:22.272
Have you lost your mind?

29:22.274 --> 29:24.506
I'm not trying to shame you,
Father, or you, Mother.

29:24.508 --> 29:28.878
You have no idea the brutality and
horrors they've brought on us.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.979
But she is not like them.
She is different.

29:30.981 --> 29:33.149
- We are their slaves.
- If you marry her,

29:33.151 --> 29:35.955
you will bring shame
and dishonor to this family.

30:18.930 --> 30:20.999
What do you want from me?

30:23.602 --> 30:26.305
Am I called to lead your people?

30:30.008 --> 30:32.076
Then show me a sign.

31:07.479 --> 31:08.881
No!

31:30.101 --> 31:32.567
You are my savior
and my strength.

31:32.569 --> 31:34.906
Forgive me, my Lord.

31:36.674 --> 31:38.243
Forgive me.

31:51.155 --> 31:53.089
- Stop singing.
- Hmm?

31:53.091 --> 31:55.460
Pardon me.
I did not see you.

32:00.431 --> 32:04.370
And what on earth is the cause
of all this smiling and singing?

32:05.502 --> 32:07.472
Does love not sing sweetly?

32:08.739 --> 32:10.672
Take my advice.

32:10.674 --> 32:14.110
Do not trust the love
of a Philistine.

32:14.112 --> 32:17.714
No, my love is a Hebrew,
unlike any other man.

32:17.716 --> 32:21.053
And his love comes
with a proposal.

32:22.519 --> 32:24.286
Marriage?

32:24.288 --> 32:28.024
You are a servant girl
to a Philistine king.

32:28.026 --> 32:30.159
Would it not be permitted?

32:30.161 --> 32:33.595
Our prince would never yield
his servant to a Hebrew.

32:33.597 --> 32:38.601
But he is respected amongst his
community, one of their leaders.

32:38.603 --> 32:40.406
And his name?

32:41.472 --> 32:43.075
Samson.

32:43.775 --> 32:45.210
Samson?

32:46.210 --> 32:48.311
The strongman
is your betrothed?

32:48.313 --> 32:50.013
Yes, my lady.
Have you heard of him?

32:50.015 --> 32:52.084
I have.

32:53.518 --> 32:55.485
Perhaps I can help you.

32:55.487 --> 32:58.086
I will speak with Prince
Rallah on your behalf.

32:58.088 --> 33:00.158
You'd do that for me?

33:01.226 --> 33:02.424
Indeed.

33:02.426 --> 33:04.462
In the name of love.

33:05.497 --> 33:07.231
Thank you.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.500
<i>I have received reports</i>

33:11.502 --> 33:14.504
that the Hebrews are
considering Samson as judge.

33:14.506 --> 33:16.671
The judge of a slave
is still a slave.

33:16.673 --> 33:19.345
- Let them do as they will.
- What would the king say?

33:20.478 --> 33:24.112
What my father thinks
is of no concern to you.

33:24.114 --> 33:27.150
The Hebrew has eyes
for your new servant girl.

33:27.152 --> 33:31.286
Well, she is pleasing
to the eye.

33:31.288 --> 33:35.291
- They plan to marry.
- That would be heresy to Dagon.

33:35.293 --> 33:36.691
Wedding a Philistine
to a Hebrew.

33:36.693 --> 33:38.026
You cannot allow this,
my lord.

33:38.028 --> 33:42.267
But if you were to bless their
union, they would be in your debt.

33:46.537 --> 33:47.970
How do you mean?

33:47.972 --> 33:52.240
Give the girl to the Hebrew, and he
will never raise a hand against you.

33:52.242 --> 33:54.142
The throne would be yours.

33:54.144 --> 33:56.481
This is madness,
my lord.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.182
He would be under my heel.

34:00.184 --> 34:02.685
Let Samson marry.

34:02.687 --> 34:04.687
We shall host
the wedding feast.

34:04.689 --> 34:07.090
My queen is cunning.

34:07.092 --> 34:08.824
And my king strong.

34:08.827 --> 34:10.760
Ashdod,
you may leave.

34:10.762 --> 34:12.297
Yes, my lord.

34:14.532 --> 34:16.699
Give me Samson...

34:16.701 --> 34:18.603
and the throne
will be ours.

34:56.440 --> 34:59.175
<i>Out of the eater,</i>

34:59.177 --> 35:00.742
<i>something to eat.</i>

35:00.744 --> 35:03.449
<i>Out of the strong...</i>

35:04.481 --> 35:06.351
<i>something sweet.</i>

35:07.851 --> 35:11.487
At least dance with
your bride-to-be once tonight.

35:11.489 --> 35:14.189
Or did you take a vow
against all fun?

35:14.191 --> 35:15.423
You dance.

35:15.425 --> 35:16.628
I will watch.

35:22.566 --> 35:25.800
Samson, my brother,
you look sober.

35:25.802 --> 35:27.670
Here, have a drink.

35:27.672 --> 35:29.371
No. I do not drink.

35:29.373 --> 35:33.508
You do not drink?
Only babies do not drink.

35:33.510 --> 35:36.244
- Should we get him some milk? Maybe a wet nurse.
- Oh.

35:36.246 --> 35:38.246
I said no.
No wine for me.

35:38.248 --> 35:40.182
It is not wine.

35:40.184 --> 35:41.383
Drink with us.

35:41.385 --> 35:43.454
It's your wedding. Drink.

35:50.961 --> 35:52.360
You lied.

35:52.362 --> 35:54.599
Just trying
to have some fun.

35:55.934 --> 35:57.867
Impressive, Hebrew.

35:57.869 --> 35:59.802
We all know
about your strength.

35:59.804 --> 36:02.271
Is there anything
more to you?

36:02.273 --> 36:05.708
Anything between those ears?

36:05.710 --> 36:07.577
I have more
than you do.

36:07.579 --> 36:08.610
- Ooh! - Ooh!
- Ooh!

36:08.612 --> 36:09.945
Perhaps a riddle?

36:09.947 --> 36:11.280
Yes.

36:11.282 --> 36:12.914
Yes? A riddle?

36:12.916 --> 36:15.186
At night I come...

36:16.954 --> 36:19.722
without being called.

36:19.724 --> 36:23.425
By day, I am lost...

36:23.427 --> 36:25.196
without being stolen.

36:26.664 --> 36:30.636
What... am... I?

36:37.541 --> 36:38.641
Too difficult?

36:40.244 --> 36:42.313
A star.

36:43.847 --> 36:46.351
All right. My turn.

36:48.318 --> 36:51.621
I have a riddle that I am
sure none of you can solve.

36:51.623 --> 36:53.622
Oh.

36:53.624 --> 36:56.728
You challenge 30 men
to a riddle?

36:57.695 --> 36:59.862
Fine. Perhaps a wager.

36:59.864 --> 37:01.666
My people
need clothes.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.267
Your tunics, all of them.

37:08.338 --> 37:10.675
Thirty Philistine tunics.

37:11.708 --> 37:12.708
Fine.

37:13.911 --> 37:17.249
But if you lose,
you owe the same.

37:18.016 --> 37:20.548
And if you don't pay,

37:20.550 --> 37:23.355
it will be your head
or your wife's.

37:24.922 --> 37:26.889
Out of the eater,

37:26.891 --> 37:29.360
something to eat.

37:30.295 --> 37:31.894
Out of the strong,

37:31.896 --> 37:35.234
something sweet.

37:36.034 --> 37:37.666
Is that it?

37:37.668 --> 37:42.438
Is my slave wit
too much for you?

37:42.440 --> 37:44.508
You have until morning
to answer.

37:46.344 --> 37:48.943
Keep those clean,
will you? Oh!

37:48.945 --> 37:50.912
Come on.

37:50.914 --> 37:53.048
Let us dance. Music.

38:02.960 --> 38:06.494
Did you really think I would
just let you run off and wed

38:06.496 --> 38:09.768
without anything
in return?

38:11.501 --> 38:14.637
"Out of the eater,
something to eat.

38:14.639 --> 38:18.543
Out of the strong,
something sweet."

38:19.844 --> 38:21.543
What does this mean to you?

38:21.545 --> 38:23.878
I know not what you
speak of, my lord.

38:24.949 --> 38:26.581
You lie.

38:26.583 --> 38:29.418
I have watched you,
you know?

38:29.420 --> 38:32.088
Seeing you talk
to your father,

38:32.090 --> 38:35.057
that thief behind the bars.

38:35.059 --> 38:37.559
It is quite
a beautiful bond you have.

38:37.561 --> 38:38.860
Really extraordinary.

38:38.862 --> 38:40.463
What are you saying?

38:40.465 --> 38:42.867
It would be a shame...

38:44.068 --> 38:45.836
if you never see him...

38:47.003 --> 38:48.706
again.

38:57.014 --> 38:59.447
<i>Your riddle,</i>

38:59.449 --> 39:01.416
it confounds them all.

39:01.418 --> 39:03.552
Rallah boasted of his wit,

39:03.554 --> 39:06.121
so I gave him and his men
something to think about.

39:06.123 --> 39:09.724
Let their small minds toil
while we have fun.

39:09.726 --> 39:13.397
- And the answer?
- You will know soon enough.

39:15.867 --> 39:17.702
What bothers you so?

39:20.470 --> 39:23.104
Tomorrow we'll be married,
husband and wife.

39:23.106 --> 39:26.775
There should be
no secrets between us.

39:26.777 --> 39:27.777
No secrets.

39:28.746 --> 39:29.878
Right.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.947
No secrets.

39:31.949 --> 39:34.682
For what
is sweeter than honey?

39:34.684 --> 39:37.621
And what is stronger
than a lion?

39:38.623 --> 39:41.626
There. Does that
solve these troubles?

39:59.876 --> 40:01.776
Ah. There he is.

40:01.778 --> 40:05.481
A groom full
of rare wit and strength.

40:05.483 --> 40:08.519
At the bottom of which
barrel did you find my answer?

40:09.653 --> 40:13.525
- You would be surprised.
- Just try me.

40:15.893 --> 40:18.597
For what is sweeter...

40:19.496 --> 40:20.695
than honey?

40:20.697 --> 40:24.834
And what is stronger
than a lion?

40:24.836 --> 40:26.101
How did you...

40:26.103 --> 40:28.704
Remind me again.
What was our wager?

40:28.706 --> 40:29.706
Oh, yes.

40:30.574 --> 40:32.740
- Thirty tunics.
- I do not have them.

40:32.742 --> 40:35.510
Well, then I fear you lose
more than your wager.

40:35.512 --> 40:37.548
- Do not touch her!
- Samson!

40:40.083 --> 40:42.686
Fine. I will find your tunics.

40:43.554 --> 40:44.923
Samson, please.

40:46.190 --> 40:48.994
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me, Samson.

41:27.130 --> 41:28.933
Hey!

41:29.867 --> 41:32.601
That water's
not for you, Hebrew.

41:34.271 --> 41:36.070
This well...

41:36.072 --> 41:39.141
is for pure
Philistine lips.

41:39.143 --> 41:42.244
Have it fouled
by the likes of you

41:42.246 --> 41:44.012
makes me sick.

41:54.324 --> 41:58.894
I said, get your dirty hands
off our water

41:58.896 --> 42:00.899
and move along!

42:06.070 --> 42:07.570
Give me your tunic.

42:07.572 --> 42:09.874
What did you say?

42:11.576 --> 42:14.845
Your tunic. Give it to me.

42:15.813 --> 42:18.713
Have you lost
your mind, Hebrew?

42:18.715 --> 42:21.584
I could leave your corpse
here for the crows

42:21.586 --> 42:24.789
and finish my drink
without a second thought!

42:32.128 --> 42:33.664
Hey.

42:50.081 --> 42:51.550
He's dead.

42:54.085 --> 42:55.586
He's dead.

43:07.030 --> 43:08.099
Your tunics.

43:09.766 --> 43:11.135
I want all of them.

43:13.003 --> 43:14.637
He's insane.

43:14.639 --> 43:16.271
Put this dog down!

44:17.300 --> 44:18.969
They cannot hurt you anymore.

44:20.170 --> 44:22.037
You're free.

44:22.039 --> 44:24.139
It's me, Samson.

44:24.141 --> 44:25.777
Our God was with us today.

44:27.844 --> 44:29.913
Help me gather their tunics.

44:31.315 --> 44:33.851
Wait. Please!

44:34.851 --> 44:36.720
I cannot touch the dead.

44:37.454 --> 44:39.690
I cannot break my vow.

44:55.306 --> 44:58.242
Rallah! Rallah!

45:05.182 --> 45:07.215
My debt is paid.

45:07.217 --> 45:08.784
Now, where is Taren?

45:08.786 --> 45:11.353
Philistine tunics, sir.

45:11.355 --> 45:12.787
There is blood.

45:12.789 --> 45:15.960
Where is my wife?

45:17.228 --> 45:19.061
You have no wife.

45:19.063 --> 45:22.831
You did not return in time
to finish the ceremony.

45:22.833 --> 45:26.869
Dagon law requires
once a wedding has begun,

45:26.871 --> 45:28.840
it must be completed.

45:30.907 --> 45:34.543
- I had to stand in your place.
- If you even touched her...

45:34.545 --> 45:38.546
Now, since you've murdered my
men and stolen their clothes,

45:38.548 --> 45:41.416
you will spend the rest
of your very short life

45:41.418 --> 45:43.722
working in the mines.

45:47.224 --> 45:48.860
Arrest this man.

45:51.394 --> 45:52.561
Sound the alarm!

46:03.407 --> 46:05.143
Get back here, Samson!

46:06.409 --> 46:09.146
Stay close and find him!

47:08.172 --> 47:10.271
The crops are burning!

47:10.273 --> 47:13.876
Why do you stand there?
Draw your bows!

47:13.878 --> 47:15.610
There's no one there, sir.

47:15.612 --> 47:17.080
What?

47:19.048 --> 47:21.115
Then who starts
the fires?

47:21.117 --> 47:23.485
The fire,
it moves on its own.

47:23.487 --> 47:25.586
Wake the prince.

47:33.463 --> 47:35.299
What is this?

47:38.601 --> 47:40.001
Rallah!

47:40.003 --> 47:45.108
Release Taren,
or all your fields will burn!

47:52.048 --> 47:55.320
- Samson!
- Samson!

47:56.353 --> 47:58.119
- No!
- Hebrew!

47:58.121 --> 47:59.287
Taren!

47:59.289 --> 48:01.389
I release them!

48:01.391 --> 48:02.958
Samson!

48:02.960 --> 48:06.130
Taren!

48:39.095 --> 48:41.266
No!

48:50.007 --> 48:51.476
Forgive me.

49:01.050 --> 49:03.487
Samson!

49:05.222 --> 49:06.391
Samson!

49:07.657 --> 49:09.493
Samson!

49:10.494 --> 49:12.095
- I don't know.
- Samson!

49:14.298 --> 49:17.201
Give me Samson
or your village burns.

49:18.635 --> 49:20.501
He's not here.

49:20.503 --> 49:22.070
I know you.

49:22.072 --> 49:25.006
Manoah,
father of Samson.

49:25.008 --> 49:26.344
Take him.

49:29.480 --> 49:30.579
Are you sure

49:30.581 --> 49:35.083
you want to bring all of Judah
into a war against you?

49:35.085 --> 49:38.320
If Samson does not show,

49:38.322 --> 49:41.088
he will find himself
without a father.

49:41.090 --> 49:44.328
And you will find yourselves
without a village.

49:50.666 --> 49:52.436
I know where he is.

49:53.369 --> 49:56.007
Go. Go.

50:07.650 --> 50:09.252
Brother.

50:10.420 --> 50:11.455
Please, leave me.

50:12.655 --> 50:14.458
God's not done with you.

50:17.094 --> 50:20.130
For years,
I pleaded with God.

50:22.166 --> 50:25.536
I asked him if you're truly
the one to deliver us all.

50:26.737 --> 50:29.273
For years,
I'd never hear anything.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.043
And then one night...

50:33.210 --> 50:35.545
I heard
a still, small voice.

50:36.646 --> 50:37.746
I looked around.

50:37.748 --> 50:41.148
I was certain someone
had spoken words,

50:41.150 --> 50:42.619
but there
was no one there.

50:44.688 --> 50:47.088
And then
it happened again.

50:47.090 --> 50:49.256
A voice so clear,

50:49.258 --> 50:51.425
a voice
with divine certainty

50:51.427 --> 50:55.197
that said I would witness
my brother free our people

50:55.199 --> 50:56.566
with the strength
of his hands.

50:57.568 --> 51:00.304
I know that you
will save us, Brother.

51:01.137 --> 51:03.206
The only question is, when?

51:05.141 --> 51:07.244
I have broken my vows.

51:08.144 --> 51:10.545
It is over.

51:10.547 --> 51:12.115
It's not over.

51:13.217 --> 51:15.452
Summon your strength,
Brother.

51:16.887 --> 51:19.257
They have father.

51:23.659 --> 51:26.628
They've come here to hand
you over to the crown

51:26.630 --> 51:28.532
in exchange for peace.

51:29.632 --> 51:32.200
And if I surrender,

51:32.202 --> 51:33.802
will Rallah free Father?

51:33.804 --> 51:36.171
Surrender is not
the solution, Brother.

51:36.173 --> 51:37.438
Then what is?

51:37.440 --> 51:39.541
Make the men of Judah
your army.

51:39.543 --> 51:42.910
They will fight for you,
and so will we.

51:42.912 --> 51:45.380
Today's the day, Samson.

51:45.382 --> 51:47.314
Today the prophecy
is fulfilled.

51:47.316 --> 51:50.184
You are Samson
of the tribe of Dan,

51:50.186 --> 51:53.255
chosen by God Almighty
and set apart.

51:53.257 --> 51:56.291
His hand of vengeance
against the Philistines.

51:56.293 --> 51:58.760
You are right, Brother.

51:58.762 --> 52:01.632
My hands <i>will</i> save our people.

52:02.632 --> 52:04.268
No, Brother.

52:06.536 --> 52:07.702
No.

52:07.704 --> 52:09.673
- Stand and fight.
- Brother.

52:53.249 --> 52:56.351
Your loyalty
to the king is acknowledged.

52:56.353 --> 52:58.623
Your village
will be spared.

53:17.974 --> 53:22.313
Before your head hits the
ground, your village will burn.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.715
And your father...

53:27.851 --> 53:29.753
will be waiting for you.

53:35.291 --> 53:37.661
No!

53:52.675 --> 53:54.411
No!

53:58.748 --> 53:59.748
Draw!

54:06.322 --> 54:08.689
Protect the prince!

54:08.691 --> 54:10.057
Kill the Hebrew!

54:15.798 --> 54:18.635
God, give me strength.

54:43.994 --> 54:46.631
Move! He's mine!

54:55.072 --> 54:57.338
Go.

54:57.340 --> 55:00.411
Bring me his head!

55:47.590 --> 55:49.826
Lord, hear my prayer.

56:10.746 --> 56:11.746
Get him!

56:14.050 --> 56:16.387
Get his head!

56:38.874 --> 56:40.844
He's the beast!

56:45.449 --> 56:48.983
Lord, I'm
your humble servant.

56:48.985 --> 56:51.052
Do not abandon me now.

56:51.054 --> 56:56.527
Make thy strength
be my strength!

57:27.690 --> 57:30.994
His god is with him!
He's invincible!

58:43.333 --> 58:44.668
Samson.

58:49.039 --> 58:50.841
Dagon!

01:00:00.409 --> 01:00:04.679
Samson, son of Manoah,

01:00:04.681 --> 01:00:07.648
chosen by God since birth

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:10.954
to bring deliverance
to your people...

01:00:17.994 --> 01:00:19.863
I anoint you.

01:00:59.869 --> 01:01:00.903
Aah!

01:01:02.972 --> 01:01:05.338
He has the strength of a god.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.208
I saw it
with my own eyes.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.744
Your eye deceives you.

01:01:09.746 --> 01:01:12.345
- Did you see him bleed?
- Yes.

01:01:12.347 --> 01:01:14.282
Then he is not a god!

01:01:14.284 --> 01:01:18.385
Go tell the Hebrews
that we will not retaliate

01:01:18.387 --> 01:01:22.058
if Samson swears
to end his violence!

01:01:22.992 --> 01:01:26.030
Go. Get out
of my sight, boy.

01:01:27.197 --> 01:01:29.133
You child!

01:01:43.213 --> 01:01:46.950
You are not a god!

01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:53.820
You risk Dagon's wrath.

01:01:53.822 --> 01:01:57.391
I do not fear Dagon
or my father.

01:01:57.393 --> 01:01:59.260
You fear another.

01:01:59.262 --> 01:02:02.700
I have seen a real god...

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.969
in a real man.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.076
That is power.

01:02:12.941 --> 01:02:15.978
I will take Samson's power.

01:02:19.382 --> 01:02:21.284
And you're going
to help me.

01:02:31.226 --> 01:02:34.394
<i>Samson was
at last anointed the judge</i>

01:02:34.396 --> 01:02:36.530
<i>and protector of our people.</i>

01:02:36.532 --> 01:02:39.900
<i>The king sent no army
against us,</i>

01:02:39.902 --> 01:02:43.503
<i>but the theft of our food
did not stop.</i>

01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:45.872
<i>Prince Rallah was
sent far to the west</i>

01:02:45.874 --> 01:02:49.976
<i>to lead campaigns into Egypt
as punishment.</i>

01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:53.146
<i>But upon his return years later,</i>

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:56.918
<i>our tribes were once again
beset with violence</i>

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.420
<i>and pushed to the brink
of starvation.</i>

01:02:59.422 --> 01:03:02.322
For years I have said
our only hope is in peace.

01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:03.458
Peace?

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.193
Our share of the coming harvest
can no longer feed us.

01:03:06.195 --> 01:03:08.829
For years we have
listened to you.

01:03:08.831 --> 01:03:11.532
We have barely endured,
yet nothing has changed.

01:03:11.534 --> 01:03:13.099
It's time for war.

01:03:13.101 --> 01:03:16.269
No. War only brings
suffering to our people.

01:03:16.271 --> 01:03:18.572
I will leave to Gaza
to negotiate peace.

01:03:18.574 --> 01:03:21.508
What you call peace,
I call starvation.

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:26.313
Our only hope is to rally the other
tribes and prepare for an attack.

01:03:26.315 --> 01:03:29.950
God did not call you from the
womb to be a politician, Brother.

01:03:29.952 --> 01:03:33.487
He gave you the strength
to fight like no man ever has.

01:03:33.489 --> 01:03:36.456
I will return with freedom,

01:03:36.458 --> 01:03:39.061
or I will not return at all.

01:04:09.626 --> 01:04:11.492
This is an outrage.

01:04:11.494 --> 01:04:12.994
I determine
what is outrage.

01:04:12.996 --> 01:04:15.662
I define what is
at risk to my kingdom.

01:04:15.664 --> 01:04:17.430
He comes here
to negotiate.

01:04:17.432 --> 01:04:19.967
He will leave in peace,

01:04:19.969 --> 01:04:22.403
because it is my wish,
thus my command,

01:04:22.405 --> 01:04:25.171
my decree, my authority.

01:04:25.173 --> 01:04:27.911
Do you not see where this
argument is going? To the door.

01:04:31.047 --> 01:04:33.883
Rallah.
You've returned.

01:04:39.155 --> 01:04:41.488
Mighty Samson.

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:43.324
At last we meet.

01:04:43.326 --> 01:04:46.994
May I offer you
some wine or some food?

01:04:46.996 --> 01:04:49.463
A jawbone
of a donkey perhaps.

01:04:49.465 --> 01:04:51.902
My son is around here
somewhere, is he not?

01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:56.137
I'm here to negotiate
for the people I serve.

01:04:56.139 --> 01:04:57.639
The same people you starve.

01:04:57.641 --> 01:05:03.343
In order to negotiate, one must have
something to negotiate with, must he not?

01:05:03.345 --> 01:05:05.378
What do you have
to offer my kingdom?

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.180
Peace.

01:05:07.182 --> 01:05:09.583
True peace
between our people.

01:05:09.585 --> 01:05:13.586
Reduce the tribute. Give back the
harvest that is rightfully ours.

01:05:13.588 --> 01:05:15.588
Or else what?

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:18.427
You will face the wrath of God.

01:05:21.331 --> 01:05:25.166
So you threaten me
with natural phenomenon,

01:05:25.168 --> 01:05:28.468
freakish acts,
and the weather.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.604
Mock me, if you will.

01:05:30.606 --> 01:05:34.307
But you will not be laughing when you
have another thousand soldiers to bury.

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:36.443
I have rebuilt my army
three times since.

01:05:36.445 --> 01:05:39.046
And the only reason
that you draw breath

01:05:39.048 --> 01:05:41.081
is because I have not given
the order to take it.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:43.085
I reject your offer.

01:05:43.719 --> 01:05:45.485
Then you choose war.

01:05:45.487 --> 01:05:47.220
I think we both know

01:05:47.222 --> 01:05:51.392
that war is not
in your best interest.

01:05:51.394 --> 01:05:54.131
Unless, of course, you choose to see
more of your loved ones perish.

01:05:55.063 --> 01:05:57.199
This is my offer to you.

01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:01.972
Disappear.

01:06:02.704 --> 01:06:05.072
You disappear,

01:06:05.074 --> 01:06:07.476
and the harvest will be
returned to your people.

01:06:09.612 --> 01:06:12.416
You ask me
to leave my people?

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.452
You have
a choice, Samson.

01:06:18.454 --> 01:06:23.360
Stay and watch
your people suffer, die...

01:06:24.394 --> 01:06:28.165
or go away...
and have them flourish.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.407
Make haste
out of the city.

01:06:40.409 --> 01:06:42.510
Tell my brother...

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:46.046
Tell him I'll return when I
change the king's heart.

01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:48.782
But you cannot linger here.

01:06:48.784 --> 01:06:50.717
If these people
even suspect who you are...

01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:53.487
Trust in God.
He will show us the way.

01:06:53.489 --> 01:06:55.124
Now, go. Hurry.

01:06:58.827 --> 01:07:02.195
A Hebrew who sits
in council with the King.

01:07:02.197 --> 01:07:04.197
You must be mistaken.

01:07:04.199 --> 01:07:07.400
My lord, forgive my manners.

01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:09.202
I'm the proprietor
of a nearby inn

01:07:09.204 --> 01:07:14.108
where important men like you
can rest and pray.

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:16.613
We're very discreet.
We ask no questions.

01:07:41.304 --> 01:07:43.104
What manner of inn is this?

01:07:43.106 --> 01:07:45.706
Nothing indecent,
I promise, my lord.

01:08:13.869 --> 01:08:18.171
I never would've come here had you been
honest about the sort of inn you run.

01:08:18.174 --> 01:08:19.707
I must speak with you.

01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:22.243
You're in the wrong room.
Go back to your madam.

01:08:22.245 --> 01:08:24.147
Samson, please.

01:08:26.348 --> 01:08:29.585
I've come here to warn you.
You're in grave danger.

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.421
Wait.

01:08:33.755 --> 01:08:35.491
I know you.

01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:38.792
Yes.

01:08:38.794 --> 01:08:42.694
You were at my wedding feast.
You were with Rallah.

01:08:42.697 --> 01:08:44.567
Yes, I was.

01:08:45.734 --> 01:08:48.572
But that was before I knew
what he was capable of.

01:08:49.437 --> 01:08:50.938
I've since left
his service.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:52.608
What are you doing here?

01:08:53.575 --> 01:08:55.876
I saw you on the street
by chance.

01:08:55.877 --> 01:08:57.912
I saw you enter here.

01:08:59.848 --> 01:09:01.515
Samson, the city
knows you're here.

01:09:01.517 --> 01:09:04.716
The people are hunting for
you even now, laying traps.

01:09:04.719 --> 01:09:07.288
Go find him!

01:09:10.759 --> 01:09:12.524
Did Rallah put you
up to this?

01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:14.560
I'm not with Rallah.

01:09:14.563 --> 01:09:17.264
I don't believe you.
You're lying.

01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:18.798
Over there!

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.734
Why would you help me?

01:09:20.736 --> 01:09:24.407
Would you be so cruel to
make me lay my heart bare?

01:09:25.774 --> 01:09:28.144
I spoke no lie.

01:09:30.679 --> 01:09:33.649
I saw you in the street
and I remembered.

01:09:36.885 --> 01:09:38.522
Taren.

01:09:42.258 --> 01:09:44.227
What about Taren?

01:09:50.265 --> 01:09:51.734
She was sweet...

01:09:52.968 --> 01:09:54.568
and innocent...

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:56.505
and pure.

01:09:58.441 --> 01:10:00.306
And for that,
the gods smiled on her

01:10:00.308 --> 01:10:02.646
and gave her
the gift of a good man.

01:10:05.748 --> 01:10:09.518
And I envied her, for I knew I would
never be allowed such a gift.

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.589
Broken as I am.

01:10:17.293 --> 01:10:18.661
Forgive me.

01:10:20.629 --> 01:10:22.462
He's awake!

01:10:22.464 --> 01:10:24.998
You're not one of my girls!
Kill them both!

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.800
Come.

01:10:29.037 --> 01:10:32.573
That's him.
The Hebrew killer Samson!

01:10:32.575 --> 01:10:34.975
Avenge your brothers
and your sons!

01:10:34.977 --> 01:10:36.644
Kill him!

01:10:36.646 --> 01:10:38.682
Kill him!

01:10:42.617 --> 01:10:43.687
In here.

01:10:50.726 --> 01:10:52.595
Hurry up!

01:10:54.664 --> 01:10:57.267
He killed my brother!

01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:10.646
What am I doing?

01:11:11.714 --> 01:11:14.748
I cannot go back
to my people as a failure.

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:17.751
I cannot stay here.
The king advises me to vanish.

01:11:17.753 --> 01:11:19.456
God tells me nothing!

01:11:21.624 --> 01:11:23.990
He killed my brother!

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:25.829
I have a house
in the valley of Sorek.

01:11:27.463 --> 01:11:29.866
You'll be safe there while you
wait for your god's answer.

01:11:33.768 --> 01:11:35.304
There he is!

01:11:36.438 --> 01:11:38.572
Make for the village
of Balsam.

01:11:38.574 --> 01:11:40.373
I will meet you on the road.

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:43.612
Stay here.
They're not after you.

01:11:47.016 --> 01:11:48.817
Get him!

01:11:59.594 --> 01:12:01.127
Where is he?
Where is he?

01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:03.632
We'll find him.

01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:08.872
He must have run
that way.

01:12:10.106 --> 01:12:12.309
We need to find him.

01:12:14.744 --> 01:12:16.577
He's here!

01:12:16.579 --> 01:12:20.146
Rally to me! I see him!

01:12:20.148 --> 01:12:21.718
Rally to me!

01:12:23.419 --> 01:12:25.455
Rally to me!

01:12:49.844 --> 01:12:51.481
Don't let him get away!

01:12:54.016 --> 01:12:55.849
Kill the heathen!

01:12:55.851 --> 01:12:57.821
Kill him! Kill him!

01:12:58.454 --> 01:12:59.923
Kill him!

01:13:00.889 --> 01:13:02.726
Where are you going to run?

01:13:04.794 --> 01:13:06.763
Catch him!

01:13:14.003 --> 01:13:15.871
There he is! Kill him!

01:13:16.772 --> 01:13:17.774
Aah!

01:13:25.214 --> 01:13:28.215
Burn that dirty beast!

01:13:30.518 --> 01:13:31.784
Kill the heathen!

01:13:31.786 --> 01:13:33.787
No! No!

01:13:45.233 --> 01:13:46.969
Come on, men!

01:13:49.705 --> 01:13:50.940
Kill him!

01:13:53.808 --> 01:13:55.508
Lord.

01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:57.914
Your servant calls
upon you once more.

01:13:59.748 --> 01:14:01.014
Kill him!

01:14:01.016 --> 01:14:03.486
With your strength...

01:14:04.519 --> 01:14:05.888
protect me.

01:14:54.236 --> 01:14:55.972
Let them witness.

01:14:57.606 --> 01:14:59.876
Let them witness the strength...

01:15:01.142 --> 01:15:02.611
of the living...

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.780
God.

01:16:19.187 --> 01:16:20.988
Samson.

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:29.030
Taren.

01:16:29.865 --> 01:16:30.934
My love.

01:16:35.403 --> 01:16:39.038
- What are you doing?
- No. Lay still.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.043
You must rest.

01:16:58.326 --> 01:16:59.728
You're awake.

01:17:00.696 --> 01:17:02.996
You have been asleep
for two days.

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:06.068
Your wounds were grave,
but I did what I could.

01:17:07.268 --> 01:17:09.269
I thought you
were someone else.

01:17:09.271 --> 01:17:10.871
Taren.

01:17:10.873 --> 01:17:14.106
You said her name many times.

01:17:14.108 --> 01:17:15.876
You truly loved her.

01:17:15.878 --> 01:17:19.311
Why do you help me?
Are you not a Philistine?

01:17:19.313 --> 01:17:22.716
I found you alone and in pain.

01:17:22.718 --> 01:17:24.885
I know what that feels like.

01:17:24.887 --> 01:17:28.758
And you would help someone
without anything in return?

01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:33.292
Takes a woman full of true
kindness to do such things,

01:17:33.294 --> 01:17:35.030
especially for a Hebrew.

01:17:42.705 --> 01:17:43.973
I must go.

01:17:45.441 --> 01:17:47.274
Please, stay
until you're healed.

01:17:47.276 --> 01:17:50.944
- No, I should not impose any further.
- It is no imposition.

01:17:50.946 --> 01:17:53.046
Let me prepare you
some food.

01:17:53.048 --> 01:17:54.050
Please stay.

01:17:55.817 --> 01:17:57.119
What is your name?

01:17:58.187 --> 01:17:59.822
Delilah.

01:18:00.955 --> 01:18:02.124
Delilah.

01:18:03.825 --> 01:18:05.794
I owe you my life.

01:18:06.461 --> 01:18:07.929
Thank you.

01:18:25.481 --> 01:18:27.413
I thought you were dead.

01:18:27.415 --> 01:18:29.815
I feel
I should be, Mother.

01:18:29.817 --> 01:18:32.084
Come in, Son.
Sit down. Sit down.

01:18:32.086 --> 01:18:33.889
I'll get some food.

01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:38.358
I have not protected
those I love.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.526
God has
protected us, Samson.

01:18:40.528 --> 01:18:42.964
I have broken
my vows to God.

01:18:44.232 --> 01:18:46.332
I have killed.

01:18:46.334 --> 01:18:48.103
Drank of the vine.

01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:52.204
Has God forsaken me?

01:18:52.206 --> 01:18:55.809
He'll never forsake you.
He will always forgive.

01:18:55.811 --> 01:18:57.843
I am beyond
his forgiveness.

01:18:57.845 --> 01:19:00.046
Oh, Son, listen.

01:19:00.048 --> 01:19:03.015
Within God's forgiveness
is his power.

01:19:03.017 --> 01:19:06.051
And your call
is still with you,

01:19:06.053 --> 01:19:09.389
but you must pursue
his desires, not your own.

01:19:09.391 --> 01:19:11.227
Listen to him.

01:19:13.195 --> 01:19:16.061
Please, pray for me.

01:19:16.063 --> 01:19:19.302
Always I pray for my children.

01:19:32.114 --> 01:19:34.784
We'll be back
tomorrow for the rest.

01:19:41.589 --> 01:19:43.125
We trusted you.

01:19:44.125 --> 01:19:47.329
And you stand there
and do nothing.

01:20:06.514 --> 01:20:08.914
When Samson
killed a thousand,

01:20:08.916 --> 01:20:10.919
we gathered
as many weapons as possible.

01:20:12.053 --> 01:20:13.920
Majority of them remain
hidden in the woods.

01:20:13.922 --> 01:20:16.489
Well done, Caleb.
We can't wait anymore.

01:20:16.491 --> 01:20:19.458
This sword has not seen a
Hebrew hand for a generation.

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:22.061
And that is far too long,
my friend.

01:20:22.063 --> 01:20:25.164
The king thinks we are weak.
His defenses are down.

01:20:25.166 --> 01:20:26.265
No.

01:20:26.267 --> 01:20:27.466
We <i>are</i> weak.

01:20:27.468 --> 01:20:29.069
Not if I get Samson
to agree.

01:20:29.071 --> 01:20:32.204
This is madness, and it
will end in our slaughter.

01:20:32.206 --> 01:20:34.541
When did we stop believing
in our God?

01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:38.078
This land was promised to us,
and we shall fight for it.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:42.184
Either join us
or stay free of our course.

01:20:51.058 --> 01:20:53.592
You leave again
so soon after weeks away.

01:20:53.594 --> 01:20:57.230
- Don't tell me it's another Philistine.
- None of your concern, Brother.

01:20:57.232 --> 01:20:59.365
Have you no regard
of your sacred vows?

01:20:59.367 --> 01:21:03.168
You just travel from one bed to
another while God's people suffer.

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:05.572
You have no understanding
of what it is you speak.

01:21:05.574 --> 01:21:09.275
This burden is far too great for
your small shoulders to bear.

01:21:09.277 --> 01:21:11.645
Curve your judgment of me, Brother.
I warn you.

01:21:11.647 --> 01:21:14.183
- Let me be.
- Let you be what exactly?

01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:16.315
I tried.

01:21:16.317 --> 01:21:18.984
I did, but I failed
many times over.

01:21:18.986 --> 01:21:20.654
And I am done with failing.

01:21:20.656 --> 01:21:22.555
God's not done with you.

01:21:22.557 --> 01:21:24.423
The men are finally
ready to fight.

01:21:24.425 --> 01:21:27.260
All we need from you, Brother,
is to lead us.

01:21:27.262 --> 01:21:32.000
I will not lead them, you,
or anyone to certain death.

01:21:48.517 --> 01:21:50.216
You came back.

01:21:50.218 --> 01:21:52.153
I had
to see you again.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.357
Please, come in.

01:22:08.035 --> 01:22:10.170
I wonder if this is
what peace feels like.

01:22:10.172 --> 01:22:12.639
Ah, peace is a dream
I can no longer feel.

01:22:12.641 --> 01:22:14.541
Then tell me,
what do you feel?

01:22:14.543 --> 01:22:15.675
Sorrow.

01:22:15.677 --> 01:22:17.243
Loss.

01:22:17.245 --> 01:22:19.949
I have known
my share of the same.

01:22:21.983 --> 01:22:24.216
What if we were
to leave all this behind?

01:22:24.218 --> 01:22:27.389
Begin again,
with no expectations.

01:22:28.357 --> 01:22:29.425
Where would you go?

01:22:30.325 --> 01:22:32.725
Goshen. Egypt.

01:22:32.727 --> 01:22:35.328
See the cities of Joseph.

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:38.198
Kush, maybe, where they
have creatures tall as trees.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.332
But you would never
leave your people.

01:22:40.334 --> 01:22:43.470
I would have to force you
or bind you.

01:22:45.173 --> 01:22:47.343
As if anything
could ever bind you.

01:22:48.576 --> 01:22:51.478
What if there was something
that could bind me?

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.145
Tell me,

01:22:53.147 --> 01:22:56.416
and I will take you to all
those places tomorrow.

01:22:56.418 --> 01:22:59.519
This would please you? To bind me
and make me like any other man.

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:03.326
You could never be like
any other man, bound or not.

01:23:04.259 --> 01:23:06.225
Then tie me up
with fresh ropes,

01:23:06.227 --> 01:23:07.627
ones that have
never been used,

01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:10.195
and I will be like
any other man.

01:23:10.197 --> 01:23:15.972
And you can take me
wherever you wish.

01:23:23.611 --> 01:23:26.248
<i>What good has come
from your time with Samson?</i>

01:23:27.549 --> 01:23:30.449
His loyalty seems to be
his only weakness.

01:23:30.451 --> 01:23:32.217
If it is a weakness.

01:23:32.219 --> 01:23:36.422
Do I need to remind you
who this man is, Delilah?

01:23:36.424 --> 01:23:38.091
He is our enemy.

01:23:38.093 --> 01:23:39.725
He's not out
to destroy us, Rallah,

01:23:39.727 --> 01:23:42.529
only to protect those
he holds dear.

01:23:42.531 --> 01:23:44.367
Let him be.

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.403
Do you have feelings
for him?

01:23:47.835 --> 01:23:50.071
Don't be silly.

01:23:52.507 --> 01:23:56.208
There was once a little sparrow
who stared all day long

01:23:56.210 --> 01:23:58.110
through the bars of her cage,

01:23:58.112 --> 01:24:00.383
longing to take flight.

01:24:01.249 --> 01:24:02.715
When the chance arose,

01:24:02.717 --> 01:24:05.350
she left her shelter.

01:24:05.352 --> 01:24:07.287
But before she could
reach the sky,

01:24:07.289 --> 01:24:13.426
a hawk descended upon her
and tore her apart,

01:24:13.428 --> 01:24:16.165
piece by piece.

01:24:18.333 --> 01:24:20.568
Let us finish
what we started.

01:24:27.776 --> 01:24:31.310
Are you certain that the Hebrews
intend to attack the crown?

01:24:31.312 --> 01:24:34.447
Yes, my king.
We swear on our lives.

01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:38.618
A group of men have been
hiding weapons in my village.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.688
Oh, this will be
a significant attack, my king.

01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:46.559
We appreciate your protection
and good graces.

01:24:46.561 --> 01:24:48.097
And you may continue to...

01:25:07.182 --> 01:25:09.481
What is wrong?

01:25:09.483 --> 01:25:10.553
Delilah?

01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:15.255
Why do you
keep things from me?

01:25:15.257 --> 01:25:16.890
Keep things from you?

01:25:16.892 --> 01:25:18.257
Yes.

01:25:18.259 --> 01:25:23.163
You say you love me, but you refuse
to share your innermost secrets.

01:25:23.165 --> 01:25:24.433
What secrets?

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.234
Who is this god who gives
you such strength?

01:25:29.236 --> 01:25:32.271
Why does he allow
your people to suffer so?

01:25:32.273 --> 01:25:34.707
Is he a cruel god, or are
you just a foolish people?

01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:37.810
- Delilah.
- If we are to be together, I should trust you.

01:25:37.812 --> 01:25:41.381
- But how can I trust you when you have lied to me.
- How have I lied?

01:25:41.383 --> 01:25:43.783
You deceived me
about the fresh ropes.

01:25:43.785 --> 01:25:46.351
I was playing along,
remember?

01:25:46.353 --> 01:25:49.258
Were there secrets
with Taren?

01:25:51.392 --> 01:25:54.262
Are there to be secrets
between us?

01:25:57.799 --> 01:25:59.599
I'm a Nazirite.

01:25:59.601 --> 01:26:01.402
What does that mean?

01:26:02.504 --> 01:26:04.871
Three vows
were bestowed upon me.

01:26:04.873 --> 01:26:07.207
No wine.

01:26:07.209 --> 01:26:09.612
No touching the dead.
No cutting of my hair.

01:26:10.778 --> 01:26:13.616
I've broken two of them.
If I were to cut my hair...

01:26:15.282 --> 01:26:18.286
I fear my strength
would leave me.

01:26:20.222 --> 01:26:22.491
Your hair?

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.429
Yes.

01:26:28.396 --> 01:26:31.300
Now there are no secrets.

01:26:43.978 --> 01:26:46.682
This is for Samson,
from the crown.

01:26:47.514 --> 01:26:48.514
He-yah!

01:26:55.889 --> 01:26:57.226
You seem quiet.

01:26:58.325 --> 01:27:00.627
What is the matter?

01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:02.331
Nothing, my love.

01:27:06.968 --> 01:27:08.470
Thank you.

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:16.008
Enough.

01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:18.347
I love you.
You know that.

01:27:39.334 --> 01:27:41.370
And I you.

01:28:16.036 --> 01:28:19.105
Samson, the Philistines
are upon you.

01:28:19.107 --> 01:28:20.672
Samson!

01:28:20.674 --> 01:28:21.940
No!

01:28:21.942 --> 01:28:23.008
Aah!

01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:24.109
My hand!

01:28:24.111 --> 01:28:25.944
Please, do not hurt him!

01:28:25.946 --> 01:28:27.613
Please!

01:28:27.615 --> 01:28:28.715
Samson!

01:28:28.717 --> 01:28:29.717
Samson!

01:28:41.095 --> 01:28:43.563
Samson's little brother.

01:28:43.565 --> 01:28:45.867
I'm going to let you watch.

01:28:48.836 --> 01:28:50.470
No.

01:28:50.472 --> 01:28:51.773
Brother. Brother!

01:28:56.977 --> 01:28:57.977
Rallah.

01:29:09.022 --> 01:29:11.858
You were a man
to be feared, Samson.

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.926
Look at you now.

01:29:13.928 --> 01:29:16.863
I will prove to your god,

01:29:16.865 --> 01:29:18.631
I am worthy of his power.

01:29:18.633 --> 01:29:23.706
I will take your place
in his favor.

01:29:25.507 --> 01:29:27.606
Rallah, you promised.

01:29:27.608 --> 01:29:28.811
No.

01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:30.743
No.

01:29:30.745 --> 01:29:32.545
Rallah. Rallah!

01:29:32.547 --> 01:29:33.913
- No!
- Rallah!

01:29:33.915 --> 01:29:35.718
- No! Rallah!
- No!

01:29:45.893 --> 01:29:47.528
Samson!

01:30:16.657 --> 01:30:17.992
Rallah!

01:30:24.632 --> 01:30:25.632
Caleb.

01:30:26.867 --> 01:30:27.870
Forgive me.

01:30:28.702 --> 01:30:31.607
Once again, I have failed.

01:30:33.208 --> 01:30:35.744
I did what was right
in my own eyes.

01:30:36.811 --> 01:30:38.614
I deserve this.

01:30:39.547 --> 01:30:41.683
I want you to know.

01:31:06.808 --> 01:31:09.542
<i>Samson, Samson, Samson.</i>

01:31:09.544 --> 01:31:11.243
The greatest warrior
ever known,

01:31:11.245 --> 01:31:14.814
yet look at you now.

01:31:14.816 --> 01:31:17.115
What a waste.

01:31:17.117 --> 01:31:18.818
Do what you came here for.

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:21.854
I'm not here
to kill you, Samson.

01:31:21.856 --> 01:31:24.860
I'm here to free you
and your brother.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:30.866
All you must do is tell me how
I may receive your power.

01:31:38.873 --> 01:31:40.105
Stand him up.

01:31:43.044 --> 01:31:44.746
Your secret.

01:31:46.013 --> 01:31:47.579
Tell me.

01:31:47.581 --> 01:31:49.548
There is no secret.

01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:51.684
My power is from God.

01:31:51.686 --> 01:31:54.587
Then petition
your god for me.

01:31:54.589 --> 01:31:56.689
Tell him that I conquered you,

01:31:56.691 --> 01:32:01.763
that I am more worthy,
that I deserve his strength.

01:32:05.232 --> 01:32:07.600
Tell him,

01:32:07.602 --> 01:32:12.104
or I will rend your flesh
and feed you to the rats!

01:32:12.106 --> 01:32:14.640
A just punishment for my sins.

01:32:14.642 --> 01:32:16.644
Do what you will.

01:32:20.013 --> 01:32:23.048
Tell me!

01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:24.050
Tell me!

01:32:25.285 --> 01:32:28.054
I will have the truth!

01:32:28.056 --> 01:32:30.558
- Now!
- Please!

01:32:31.291 --> 01:32:32.358
Stop!

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:33.929
I'll tell you.

01:32:43.705 --> 01:32:45.807
Tell me what I must do.

01:32:47.342 --> 01:32:49.678
Fear the living God.

01:32:50.378 --> 01:32:52.014
Humble yourself.

01:32:53.114 --> 01:32:54.816
Or he will humble you.

01:33:05.626 --> 01:33:08.026
Why? Why have you not
brought me his head?

01:33:08.028 --> 01:33:09.662
Samson is my trophy.

01:33:09.664 --> 01:33:12.364
You have captured
a beloved leader.

01:33:12.366 --> 01:33:15.368
You must kill him
before they come for him.

01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:17.970
- That would be a waste.
- Waste?

01:33:17.972 --> 01:33:22.173
Word of Samson's power has
spread from Persia to Thebes.

01:33:22.175 --> 01:33:25.944
And now they will know
that we have conquered him.

01:33:25.946 --> 01:33:27.113
Conquered him.

01:33:27.115 --> 01:33:30.382
We use him to show his people
and anyone who challenges us

01:33:30.384 --> 01:33:34.319
that we are greater
than their gods.

01:33:34.321 --> 01:33:37.056
I will be feared everywhere.

01:33:37.058 --> 01:33:38.724
I fear you...

01:33:38.726 --> 01:33:40.292
Year after year,

01:33:40.294 --> 01:33:43.863
we will celebrate his
humiliation and the triumph.

01:33:43.865 --> 01:33:47.135
- My triumph over his god...
- Triumph? Triumph?

01:33:48.068 --> 01:33:49.868
You imbecile.

01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:52.104
You've learned nothing.

01:33:52.106 --> 01:33:54.006
You know nothing.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.182
Father.

01:34:02.884 --> 01:34:05.784
You no longer rule over me

01:34:05.786 --> 01:34:07.688
or this kingdom.

01:34:09.223 --> 01:34:12.792
I may not have your wisdom,
your experience,

01:34:12.794 --> 01:34:14.325
or even your love,

01:34:14.327 --> 01:34:16.962
but I have your crown!

01:34:16.964 --> 01:34:21.769
And this is a glory
I wish not to share with you.

01:34:30.343 --> 01:34:32.478
My son the king.

01:34:41.254 --> 01:34:43.991
You have a visitor, Hebrews.

01:35:00.308 --> 01:35:02.108
It is me, my love.

01:35:02.110 --> 01:35:05.077
I'm here to pay
for your release.

01:35:05.079 --> 01:35:08.250
Paid with the silver
that put me here.

01:35:10.852 --> 01:35:13.853
Rallah misled me.

01:35:13.855 --> 01:35:16.422
I believed I could free you,
but I was wrong.

01:35:16.424 --> 01:35:19.261
I will give back every piece
of silver for your release.

01:35:21.195 --> 01:35:23.165
Show your love for me now.

01:35:24.766 --> 01:35:26.966
Free Caleb instead of me.

01:35:26.968 --> 01:35:29.068
I cannot leave you here.

01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:30.972
Free him...

01:35:32.373 --> 01:35:34.742
and you can have
my forgiveness.

01:35:50.324 --> 01:35:52.094
I will always love you.

01:35:54.128 --> 01:35:55.128
Delilah.

01:36:04.405 --> 01:36:06.074
Oh!

01:36:06.973 --> 01:36:08.474
You were right, Caleb.

01:36:08.476 --> 01:36:10.879
We should fight.

01:36:11.512 --> 01:36:12.877
Gather the men.

01:36:12.879 --> 01:36:15.413
Prepare to take the city.

01:36:15.415 --> 01:36:18.016
But how can I without you?

01:36:18.018 --> 01:36:20.985
With the power God
has placed within you.

01:36:20.987 --> 01:36:23.823
He has not abandoned me, Caleb,
because I am in these chains.

01:36:23.825 --> 01:36:27.229
Even inside these walls
I hear his call.

01:36:28.495 --> 01:36:30.895
And maybe for the first time,

01:36:30.897 --> 01:36:34.034
I'm hearing his desires
and not my own.

01:36:34.835 --> 01:36:36.868
I love you.

01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:39.907
I love you, Brother. Oh!

01:36:52.119 --> 01:36:55.587
My strength
is now your strength.

01:36:55.589 --> 01:36:57.958
My eyes yours.

01:36:59.326 --> 01:37:03.197
You have called me from birth,
and now I listen.

01:37:06.334 --> 01:37:08.870
What would you have me do?

01:37:15.142 --> 01:37:16.344
Oh!

01:37:42.436 --> 01:37:47.972
I am your mighty king
who, with the power of Dagon,

01:37:47.974 --> 01:37:50.975
have subjugated
even the strongest man.

01:37:50.977 --> 01:37:54.413
Are you ready
for our special guest?

01:37:54.415 --> 01:37:57.219
Yes!

01:37:58.184 --> 01:38:00.254
Bring the prisoner.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.135
Kill him!

01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:17.535
Kill him!

01:38:17.537 --> 01:38:20.241
- Murderer!
- Kill him!

01:38:24.544 --> 01:38:26.145
Kill him!

01:38:26.147 --> 01:38:27.449
Boo!

01:38:34.554 --> 01:38:36.322
Murderer!

01:38:36.324 --> 01:38:38.093
Kill him!

01:38:48.635 --> 01:38:50.938
Kill him!

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:04.082
Dagon's arm is mighty
and his vengeance swift.

01:39:04.084 --> 01:39:06.484
Praise be to Dagon.

01:39:06.486 --> 01:39:08.386
Praise be to Dagon!

01:39:08.388 --> 01:39:10.722
Praise be to Dagon!

01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:52.232
Kill him!
String him up! Come on!

01:39:59.473 --> 01:40:01.242
Murderer!

01:40:14.254 --> 01:40:16.121
Lord.

01:40:16.123 --> 01:40:18.492
Give me your strength
one last time.

01:40:19.559 --> 01:40:22.597
Let me die with the Philistines.

01:40:30.638 --> 01:40:31.638
No.

01:40:44.451 --> 01:40:47.422
Kill him! Kill him!

01:41:06.173 --> 01:41:07.405
Kill the prisoner.

01:41:07.407 --> 01:41:09.640
Kill him!

01:41:09.642 --> 01:41:11.178
Kill him!

01:41:33.366 --> 01:41:34.468
Kill him!

01:42:20.681 --> 01:42:22.183
No!

01:42:36.897 --> 01:42:39.264
<i>On that day,</i>

01:42:39.266 --> 01:42:41.536
<i>my brother heard God's call.</i>

01:42:42.769 --> 01:42:46.206
<i>He fulfilled the promise
that was given before his birth.</i>

01:42:47.441 --> 01:42:50.708
<i>To our people,
it was a day for joy.</i>

01:42:50.710 --> 01:42:53.647
<i>Free at last from
the Philistine tyrant, Rallah.</i>

01:42:55.648 --> 01:42:58.283
<i>But for us who knew Samson</i>

01:42:58.285 --> 01:43:01.686
<i>as a brother and as a son,</i>

01:43:01.688 --> 01:43:05.489
<i>it was a day to mourn
the passing of a good man.</i>

01:43:05.491 --> 01:43:08.827
<i>A man whose heart
was as vast as his strength.</i>

01:43:08.829 --> 01:43:12.631
Brothers! Hebrews!
Today we fight!

01:43:12.633 --> 01:43:15.734
God is with us!

01:43:15.736 --> 01:43:17.269
God is with us!

01:43:17.271 --> 01:43:19.704
Samson! Samson! Samson!

01:43:19.706 --> 01:43:25.476
Samson! Samson!
Samson! Samson! Samson!

01:43:25.478 --> 01:43:29.314
<i>Many battles were yet to be
fought over the Promised Land.</i>

01:43:29.316 --> 01:43:31.917
<i>The Philistines
sent their armies,</i>

01:43:31.919 --> 01:43:34.920
<i>but the tribes of Israel
had awakened.</i>

01:43:34.922 --> 01:43:37.322
<i>We'd seen miracles done,</i>

01:43:37.324 --> 01:43:40.591
<i>and we knew then that no force
could stand against us,</i>

01:43:40.593 --> 01:43:44.464
<i>for the strength and the faith
of Samson was within us all.</i>

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:50.668
<i>God gave us Samson
to begin our deliverance.</i>

01:43:50.670 --> 01:43:53.240
<i>But who would he send
to finish it?</i>

01:43:54.474 --> 01:43:58.743
<i>A generation later,
a small shepherd boy named David</i>

01:43:58.745 --> 01:44:00.479
<i>stepped onto the battlefield</i>

01:44:00.481 --> 01:44:04.749
<i>and challenged an
undefeatable Philistine giant.</i>

01:44:04.751 --> 01:44:06.984
<i>The time had come.</i>

01:44:06.986 --> 01:44:11.792
<i>God had at long last
chosen a Hebrew king.</i>
