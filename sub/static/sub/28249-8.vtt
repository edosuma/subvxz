WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.484
Previously, on "The Village"...

00:06.528 --> 00:08.071
Who's Rashad,
and what happened to him?

00:08.095 --> 00:10.358
- I don't know.
- Gwendolina Ferrari,

00:10.401 --> 00:12.316
I'd like to ask for your company

00:12.360 --> 00:14.188
and a night you'll never forget.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.667
Dana's my first wife.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.278
We never technically
got divorced.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.932
- Are you still attached?
- Ava, I love you.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.543
I've moved on.

00:21.586 --> 00:24.459
I just want people to
leave me alone to fight this.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.287
Does that include me too?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.690
He didn't just
find out about us.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.246
He's known for years.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.031
- Katie, please.
- Let me go,

00:31.074 --> 00:34.773
or I will never speak
to you again!

00:34.817 --> 00:36.036
Hey, Nicky...

00:38.212 --> 00:39.735
I think you should leave.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.247 --> 01:15.292
- Hello?
- You dressed?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.207
I got a box of your decorations
out of storage.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.383
We are going to
cheer this joint up.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.342
I appreciate the effort,
Patricia,

01:21.385 --> 01:23.213
but I don't feel
like decorating.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.736
Okay, so how can I say this?

01:24.780 --> 01:28.131
Your sadness is
dripping through my ceiling.

01:28.175 --> 01:31.874
So you are going to
deck your halls,

01:31.917 --> 01:34.224
and then, you're going to make
your gingerbread cookies

01:34.268 --> 01:37.749
for my party, which you
will attend with bells on.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.795
I lost my
gingerbread-making partner.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.101
She's not lost.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.364
She's just exploring
her independence.

01:43.407 --> 01:46.149
At 26 weeks pregnant
with some random street kid.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.542
Who is really cute and talks

01:47.585 --> 01:50.284
like a character from
"My Fair Lady."

01:50.327 --> 01:53.678
Speaking of charming gentleman
who I think mean well...

01:53.722 --> 01:55.593
Don't say it.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.180
How do you expect your
daughter to ever forgive you

01:57.204 --> 01:59.467
if you're not willing
to do the same for Nick?

02:02.861 --> 02:04.385
Why are you doing this?

02:04.428 --> 02:05.971
Because somebody's got to
Jacob Marley your ass,

02:05.995 --> 02:08.476
and I'm not waiting
until I'm actually a ghost.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.482
Come here.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.188
I miss you too.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.241
Good morning, you.

02:34.284 --> 02:35.720
Your phone's been blowing up.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.113
My mother reminding me

02:37.157 --> 02:38.636
I have an ultrasound today.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.769
Which means you'll
have to talk to her?

02:40.812 --> 02:43.380
Hard to be
a moving target in stirrups.

02:43.424 --> 02:47.732
It's been a few weeks.
Maybe it's time.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.517
Are you trying to get rid of me?

02:49.560 --> 02:53.564
Of course not, but you're
about to get rid of me.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.827
I have been invited
to show my work

02:55.871 --> 02:57.220
in Berlin over the holiday.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.310
Liam, that's amazing! Yay!

03:00.354 --> 03:02.443
Well, a humble cook makes good.

03:02.486 --> 03:06.229
But in the meantime,
may I present

03:06.273 --> 03:08.666
the hungry woman's breakfast.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.191
- I'm eating for two.
- Completely.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.540
I mean, of course,

03:12.583 --> 03:14.344
one of you has a stomach
the size of a thimble,

03:14.368 --> 03:17.240
but the other
is very, very hungry.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.286
I will stab you with this fork.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.026
Can you imagine the headline?

03:21.070 --> 03:23.812
"Mediocre Burner of Other's
Art Justifiably Murdered."

03:23.855 --> 03:27.859
Ooh, I mean, it's almost
worth it, isn't it?

03:36.955 --> 03:39.044
How many times
do I have to tell you?

03:39.088 --> 03:41.264
- Take it away.
- It's tiny.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.223
Pops, you and I are very lucky.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.615
We like a lot
of the same things.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.443
Christmas isn't one of them.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.204
I bet that pretty lawyer
in an elf costume

03:48.228 --> 03:49.707
would change your mind.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.406
I can pretty much guarantee
we won't find out.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.059
- Who doesn't like Christmas?
- Me.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.845
- That was rhetorical.
- II have to study.

03:56.888 --> 04:01.328
This is all a distraction.
Come on, vamoose.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.416
You're a Scrooge.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.158
Bah, humbug.

04:18.345 --> 04:21.913
Um, do you want to explain this?

04:21.957 --> 04:24.220
I mean, I've heard of men
hiding magazines,

04:24.264 --> 04:25.787
but a record?

04:25.830 --> 04:29.007
It was going to be
a gift for you.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.661
That's Wendy Parker,

04:30.705 --> 04:32.489
Olivia's friend
from gospel brunch.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.404
I'm aware. I just didn't know

04:34.448 --> 04:37.320
that she was lurking
under my bed.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.281
Patricia Davis, are you jealous?

04:41.324 --> 04:46.764
No, I'm leaving.
I'm late for work.

04:46.808 --> 04:50.290
Sorry to leave the rest of
this party prep for you.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.117
I can't believe
they called you in.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.946
It's tree-trimming day.
The food is all made.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.731
It's in the fridge.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.428
And I'll be back
in time for the party.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.560
Pick a good one.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.257
A small good one.

05:03.259 --> 05:04.391
Patricia.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.959
I love you.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.268
I love you too.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.589
Look, thanks for coming with.
Patricia had a conflict.

05:28.632 --> 05:31.548
I love to pick a tree
as much as the next guy,

05:31.592 --> 05:33.811
but 15 blocks?
No, it's worth the walk.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.422
I'm telling you, I got a guy.

05:35.465 --> 05:36.945
I mean, he hooks me up
every year.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.601
Look at this one.
It's like a picture book.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.385
It's like a picture book.
No, no.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.648
I'm not into the Douglas Fir.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.824
This is the Cadillac
of Christmas trees.

05:46.868 --> 05:50.741
Well, why drive a Cadillac
when you can own a Rolls?

05:50.785 --> 05:55.180
The soft needles,
the full body... that scent.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.921
And everybody's got one.

05:56.965 --> 06:00.098
You know, I'm a Blue Spruce guy.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.100
Elegant, rare.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.146
And like shoving your hand
in a box of needles.

06:04.189 --> 06:07.454
No, no, no, no, but it's...
I like a little bite.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.326
Attitude.

06:11.762 --> 06:17.115
Look at you, my bubba!
This is my girl.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.770
Your girl's an Amazon.
She's going to cost a fortune.

06:19.814 --> 06:22.425
You can have that for
a buck 40, old times' sake.

06:24.035 --> 06:28.953
Like I said, I got a guy.
Merry Christmas.

06:28.997 --> 06:32.000
Delivery's $200.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.263
Delivery is free.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.526
Not this year. This year, $200.

06:36.570 --> 06:40.008
- Your guy's a thief.
- You got another option?

06:42.053 --> 06:45.056
Yeah, I do.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.888
Boy.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.109
Look at that.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.198
I was hoping
my 15 minutes of fame

06:56.241 --> 06:57.547
might be more illustrious.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.463
Come on, man. This is great.

07:00.507 --> 07:03.510
You know, this reminds me
of when men were men.

07:03.553 --> 07:07.165
I was alive then.
We paid for delivery.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.907
- Come on.
- Are you pulling?

07:09.951 --> 07:12.083
- I'm pulling. You pulling?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.911
I got most of the weight
on this side.

07:13.955 --> 07:14.999
Yeah?

07:51.906 --> 07:53.385
A lot harder to leave you alone

07:53.429 --> 07:56.345
when you show up
during my shift.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.912
I was looking for you.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.225
Does Ron know you've gone
rogue with his playlist?

08:07.269 --> 08:10.402
- You want to know a secret?
- You might think twice.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.187
I didn't react
so well to the last one.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.495
- I hate jazz.
- This is a jazz bar.

08:15.538 --> 08:19.281
Yeah, that's what Ron
keeps saying.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.588
The funny thing is...

08:21.631 --> 08:27.898
I change the music,
and suddenly, it's not.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.292
If only life were that easy.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.948
- Nick...
- What's in the box?

08:34.991 --> 08:37.255
Christmas decorations.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.866
I thought maybe
you'd want to decorate.

08:39.909 --> 08:43.957
- At the veteran's housing?
- Why not?

08:47.222 --> 08:49.485
Also, it gave me a reason
to come down here.

08:53.315 --> 08:56.318
I was angry, and I was drunk.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.059
I had no right
to ask you to leave.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.452
- Sarah...
- But if you come back,

09:00.496 --> 09:02.629
I'm afraid she won't.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.327
So...

09:05.370 --> 09:08.460
I don't really know
what else to offer.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.289
I'm fine where I am, really.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.248
That's a lie.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.337
You have the same lie face.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.607
I think maybe
a little distance is good.

09:24.651 --> 09:29.264
And I'd say we both put a lot
of work into staying apart.

09:29.307 --> 09:33.094
Maybe there's a reason.

09:33.137 --> 09:36.271
I should go.

09:36.314 --> 09:42.233
I would like to talk to her
at some point, if that's okay.

09:42.277 --> 09:46.498
You're her father.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.327
Hey, you remember
Christmas, 2000?

09:54.071 --> 09:56.465
Yeah.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.902
I got a snow globe.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.764
- Come on, yeah.
- Boy.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.853
Let's rest up here
at this corner, okay?

10:36.897 --> 10:38.097
- Why not?
- Let's take a rest.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.728
The bells are ringing.
Are we dead?

10:41.771 --> 10:43.512
We're good.

10:43.555 --> 10:47.690
- Ooh, something just popped.
- I have rope burns.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.998
- Worth it, though?
- I felt like a kid again.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.217
Only 12 blocks to go.

10:54.741 --> 10:55.916
Thank you.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.569
Two hot chocolates.
All right, sir.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.397
When Rosemary and I
used to go skating,

10:59.441 --> 11:01.573
we'd always stop for cocoa.

11:01.617 --> 11:04.968
Must be hard...
Holidays without her.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.405
She made me promise
to make the best of things.

11:09.756 --> 11:13.020
I don't know what I'd do
without Patricia.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.936
You'd find a friend and
lug a tree around Brooklyn.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.722
Heard you found a new friend.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.420
- Gwendolina.
- Gwendolina.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.248
You invite her to our party?

11:24.292 --> 11:26.250
I thought about it.
I don't know.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.818
It feels like Rosemary's turf.
Well, you ask me,

11:28.862 --> 11:31.734
this falls under
"making the best of things."

11:35.129 --> 11:36.783
To the journey.

11:53.408 --> 11:57.194
- Come in.
- I have to head out.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.719
- Did someone buzz?
- Yes.

12:02.373 --> 12:05.115
Hey.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.551
You let him in?

12:06.595 --> 12:09.990
He is a trained killer.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.948
Retired.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.776
I'll be in the other room.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.821
Stay?

12:19.042 --> 12:20.609
I'll leave if you want.

12:20.652 --> 12:23.046
You've got one minute.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.657
Right.

12:25.701 --> 12:28.138
Well, first, these are
Christmas decorations.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.444
Your mom thought that...

12:29.487 --> 12:31.968
Can you just
give me your excuse?

12:33.970 --> 12:36.364
I don't have one.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.148
What?

12:38.192 --> 12:40.455
I wish I did.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.978
No, I'vel've been
racking my brain,

12:42.022 --> 12:47.157
trying to remember one moment,
one reason.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.811
The truth is,

12:48.855 --> 12:50.682
sometimes the biggest
of decisions

12:50.726 --> 12:52.162
get made by degrees.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.729
It was one decision.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.427
You saw a picture of me,
and you didn't come home.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.125
- I have to go.
- Do you remember

12:58.168 --> 12:59.953
deciding to keep the baby?

12:59.996 --> 13:01.824
Or did you not decide,

13:01.868 --> 13:04.696
night after night,
until somehow,

13:04.740 --> 13:06.133
it was decided for you?

13:06.176 --> 13:08.570
Would you be here
if you hadn't been blown up?

13:10.006 --> 13:11.747
The truth is,
you didn't want to be my dad

13:11.791 --> 13:13.967
until you couldn't
be a soldier anymore.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.621
I'm sorry if I don't feel like
being your consolation prize.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.710
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.712
Then why'd you come?

13:22.366 --> 13:25.108
To admit that I failed you.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.544
Duly noted.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.819
I sleep here on the couch.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.432
And what do you do
before the test?

13:44.475 --> 13:46.062
Write down all the reasons
why I'm nervous,

13:46.086 --> 13:49.567
rip it up, and throw it away.
And breathe.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.613
- You'll do great.
- Late again.

13:51.656 --> 13:52.875
I'm so sorry.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.877
I love my extra time with her.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.879
You let me know
how the test goes.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.229
Okay.

13:59.273 --> 14:02.580
You have a second?
I want to talk about Sami.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.756
Your trial's in two weeks.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.672
I haven't decided
what I'll do if I'm deported.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.590
There is a good school
near my parents.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.288
I don't know if I can leave him.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.377
If you take him,
then when will I see him again?

14:16.420 --> 14:19.771
If I leave him, when will I?

14:19.815 --> 14:21.861
There is no good answer.

14:24.472 --> 14:25.908
I love Sami.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.913
And I would do anything
to stay in his life...

14:33.263 --> 14:36.049
Just as I did everything
to keep you in mine.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.410
Katie.
I've been looking for you.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.542
I've been on the third floor.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.762
- You got my text?
- I got all of them.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.721
I'm compiling them
into a very repetitive novel.

14:56.765 --> 14:59.028
You didn't respond.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.291
Katie, I know that...
Hey, you two.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.467
Hi! I'll grab my coat.

15:03.511 --> 15:07.080
I'm so sorry I'm late.
They told me the third floor.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.345
You didn't know I was coming.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.825
We're still trying
to find some common ground.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.176
And I just stepped
in the middle of it.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.223
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.356
No, it's fine.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.315
This could be your baby.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.143
Ultrasound, anyone?

15:34.977 --> 15:37.675
This is a before and after
of your tumor.

15:41.853 --> 15:45.031
I was kind of hoping
it had flown the coop.

15:45.074 --> 15:48.121
It did shrink,
but only marginally.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.340
You said you had more pain?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.956
I'll be advising
we forego further chemo

15:56.999 --> 15:59.784
and move forward
with a full hysterectomy.

16:04.659 --> 16:08.445
It's causing a blockage that's
potentially very dangerous.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.757
How soon?

16:15.800 --> 16:18.325
Before the holiday, I'm afraid.

16:18.368 --> 16:23.025
Patricia, we want you
to have more of them.

18:48.605 --> 18:51.826
I'm looking for Ben Jones.
A neighbor said he's down here.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.567
I'm sorry, he's out with my son.

18:53.610 --> 18:54.655
Can I help you?

18:54.698 --> 18:56.526
I'm sort of his...

18:56.570 --> 18:59.834
His wife.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.750
You?

19:02.793 --> 19:05.318
His girlfriend.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.624
Um...

19:07.668 --> 19:09.670
thisthis is awkward.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.674
I'm sorry. I'ml'm going to go.

19:13.717 --> 19:16.155
Can I offer you some tea?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.884
I'm looking for Chief Reisch.
He still around?

19:49.927 --> 19:52.191
Retired years ago.
Can I help you?

19:52.234 --> 19:55.977
Yeah, this used to be
my house, for a minute.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.240
I was hoping he could help
to jog my memory.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.635
- Okay, when were you here?
- 2001.

20:04.159 --> 20:07.467
Yeah, um, let me see if
someone's got his number.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.251
Thank you.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.681
Hey, so if you want
to leave your info, we can...

20:49.204 --> 20:51.293
Get right back to you.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.832
Hi. Where did Katie Campbell go?

21:08.876 --> 21:10.443
I think she went back
with her mom.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.926
We are up and running.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.581
Katie?

22:21.731 --> 22:24.168
Thank you...

22:24.212 --> 22:25.648
for including me today.

22:25.692 --> 22:29.130
Itit means a lot
not to miss these moments

22:29.173 --> 22:30.958
if we move forward,

22:31.001 --> 22:33.874
and I am sorry
we started without you.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.529
She kind of insisted. She's 17.

22:36.572 --> 22:42.099
Crazy hormones and angry.
It's not your fault.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.841
Did she tell you Liam's
going to Berlin?

22:44.885 --> 22:47.061
Over the holiday.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.584
She's going to be alone?

22:48.628 --> 22:51.152
In that neighborhood?
I don't love it either,

22:51.195 --> 22:54.416
so I told her she would be
welcome to stay with us.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.983
Katie has a home.

22:56.026 --> 22:57.985
If she wants one,
she knows where it is.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.987
Understood.

23:04.470 --> 23:08.212
Did they tell you the sex?
The baby?

23:08.256 --> 23:10.301
Yeah. Do you want to know?

23:11.999 --> 23:14.305
It's a boy.

23:14.349 --> 23:17.439
She's having a boy.

23:17.483 --> 23:21.791
Don't tell Katie.
She asked not to know.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.881
I'll buy you a second. Hi.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.325
- That smells great.
- Ranginak.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.980
It's a Persian desert
made with dates.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.853
- Mine are lumps of coal.
- I'm sorry?

23:39.896 --> 23:43.204
Chocolate-dipped
Rice Krispie treats.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.814
They're supposed
to look like coal,

23:44.858 --> 23:46.990
like Santa leaves
when you're bad.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.688
There's a sweet old lady
at our church,

23:48.731 --> 23:50.298
asked me to bring them to Ben.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.300
I didn't have the heart
to say no.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.607
I didn't know Ben
belonged to a church.

23:54.650 --> 23:55.999
He used to.

23:56.043 --> 23:58.393
Losing our son made that hard.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.092
You still go?

24:02.136 --> 24:04.617
The alternative seemed harder.

24:07.271 --> 24:10.013
My mother used to say...

24:13.713 --> 24:15.236
It means.

24:15.279 --> 24:18.369
"The wound is the place
where the light enters you."

24:18.413 --> 24:22.025
Well, in that case,
I am full of light.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.940
Ho, ho, ho, my lady.

24:23.984 --> 24:27.074
Your men have return...

24:29.555 --> 24:32.906
Dana...

24:32.949 --> 24:34.777
what are you doing here?

24:36.823 --> 24:39.478
Having tea, but I should go.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.742
Thank you.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.013
Dana, wait. Dana.

24:53.056 --> 24:55.015
Dana, wait.
I shouldn't have come.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.843
Please, will you
just talk to me?

24:59.759 --> 25:02.718
You drove by because
you wanted a divorce.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.896
You should have been honest.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.245
I didn't want to hurt you.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.334
I lost a son.

25:10.378 --> 25:12.598
What's a little more?

25:19.648 --> 25:22.433
Here.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.523
I won't even make you ask.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.574
Dana.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.097
It's fine.

25:34.141 --> 25:36.839
I'm just glad
you're happy now, Ben.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.236
I'll see you around.

26:15.530 --> 26:19.142
Paris or the Caribbean?

26:19.186 --> 26:20.579
Excuse me?

26:20.622 --> 26:22.885
The vacation
you're fantasizing about.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.280
Clearly, your mind is elsewhere.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.239
Is this how men
say hello these days?

26:29.283 --> 26:32.503
I was going to ask
if I could buy you a drink.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.723
And what stopped you?

26:34.767 --> 26:37.639
It felt like it might be cliché.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.511
I see.

26:40.555 --> 26:44.298
So can I buy you a drink?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.652
Cabernet.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.568
Excuse me, bartender.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.744
Can the lady have a Cab, please?

26:57.311 --> 27:01.228
- You have a kind smile.
- Thank you.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.980
Andre.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.291
Madeleine.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.342
You can't do this to me, Katie.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.300
It hurts too much.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.694
I thought it was your day off.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.262
It's the only place
you can't walk away.

27:35.305 --> 27:36.829
Watch me.

27:38.613 --> 27:41.921
You're going to lock me in?
Mom, open the door.

27:41.964 --> 27:45.185
Or what? You'll leave?

27:45.228 --> 27:48.275
Never speak to me again?

27:48.318 --> 27:50.625
You have nothing left
to threaten me with,

27:50.669 --> 27:52.453
and I have nothing left
if you're gone.

27:52.496 --> 27:53.846
You hurt me.

27:53.889 --> 27:56.631
I need space,
and you're suffocating me.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.199
I can't get close enough
to suffocate you.

27:59.242 --> 28:00.940
Then stop trying!

28:00.983 --> 28:03.856
It's like you can't believe
that I'm okay on my own.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.466
You're not on your own.

28:05.509 --> 28:08.208
You just have somebody new
taking care of you.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.166
Some guy you barely know.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.690
I mean, what are
you two? Dating?

28:11.733 --> 28:14.040
What I am
is stronger than you think.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.259
You're as strong as I made you.

28:16.303 --> 28:19.132
I gave you everything I had.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.743
When I was broke,
when I was sick,

28:21.787 --> 28:23.876
when I was scared,
when I was lonely.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.748
You lied to me
for my entire life.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.011
I made a mistake!

28:31.884 --> 28:34.190
I am a good mother.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.377
But if all you want
is to cut me out...

28:49.989 --> 28:51.773
I'll give you that too.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.528
- Pops.
- Davey, you're just in time.

29:07.571 --> 29:10.836
- Your text said you fell.
- Did I say "fell"?

29:10.879 --> 29:13.664
I meant felled a tree.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.970
We need help dragging it.

29:15.014 --> 29:16.493
That's not an emergency.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.365
Wait till you see how big it is.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.803
Merry Christmas!

29:24.719 --> 29:25.894
Happy Hanukkah!

29:25.938 --> 29:27.766
Yeah, now don't you feel better?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.289
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.473
Merry Christmas!

29:42.128 --> 29:44.826
It wasn't always easy,

29:44.870 --> 29:47.437
but it was always an adventure.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.875
What about you?

29:49.918 --> 29:51.398
30 years on Wall Street.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.835
I liquidated and
moved to the country.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.054
To do what?

29:55.097 --> 29:56.925
To, pretend I like sheep

29:56.969 --> 29:59.972
and plot my next trip
back into the city.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.191
Well, there's also
piles of leaves

30:02.235 --> 30:05.107
and there's fireplaces
that burn real wood.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.414
Are you trying
to sell me a timeshare?

30:07.457 --> 30:10.417
I'm asking you to come with me.

30:10.460 --> 30:13.594
Spend a few days.

30:13.637 --> 30:16.379
See what happens.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.904
That is a very tempting offer.

30:18.947 --> 30:21.036
It's your call.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.650
My room.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.268
Excuse me.

30:35.311 --> 30:38.662
I'd like to order
a bottle of champagne.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.274
Will you be
taking it up yourself?

30:41.317 --> 30:42.710
No.

30:42.753 --> 30:44.799
Send it up, please.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.671
I'm going home to my party.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.114
I went by
her place the other day

30:55.157 --> 30:58.204
intending on asking
for the divorce.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.293
What stopped you?

31:00.336 --> 31:03.252
I saw she was still wearing
her wedding ring.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.820
I couldn't take
something else away from her.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.258
Isn't leaving her
with false hope just as bad?

31:11.434 --> 31:15.177
Or maybe it's not false hope.
She gave the ring back.

31:15.221 --> 31:18.572
It's over.
I'll file the paperwork.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.182
I understand you're upset.
I get it...

31:20.226 --> 31:24.491
I'm just trying
to figure out where I stand.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.974
But two weeks from now,
where I stand

31:26.014 --> 31:27.320
might be 6,000 miles away,

31:27.363 --> 31:31.890
so maybe there is
no point in asking.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.240
But I think
you should ask yourself

31:34.283 --> 31:35.719
if you're really
in love with us,

31:35.763 --> 31:39.898
or if it just feels good
to have a family again.

31:44.293 --> 31:47.470
- I told you it was too big.
- No, II ballparked.

31:47.514 --> 31:50.430
A ballpark is about
the only place it would fit.

31:50.473 --> 31:53.912
Hey, take it easy, son.
Be gentle.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.174
Tell the tree.

31:55.217 --> 31:57.002
It's like sawing
through razor wire.

31:57.045 --> 32:00.440
The good news is all of my cuts
have been sealed up with sap.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.137
That's why you go Douglas Fir.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.356
Downy soft limbs.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.401
No, no,
like kissing your sister.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.490
A Blue Spruce
will make you earn it,

32:07.534 --> 32:10.232
but it's worth the chase. There.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.495
What the hell
are you two talking about?

32:12.539 --> 32:14.976
This piece is for you, Gabriel.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.543
Thank you for your trouble.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.632
It's no use. He's a lost cause.

32:18.675 --> 32:21.113
Well, lost causes
are the reason for the season.

32:21.156 --> 32:23.550
I'm going to go
blowtorch my hands.

32:26.596 --> 32:30.165
That tree is going
to be beautiful, man.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.776
Thank you for your help.
Of course.

32:32.820 --> 32:35.127
Not a Christmas fan?

32:35.170 --> 32:38.130
My parents split up
on Christmas.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.480
Mom walked out,
Dad went to the office.

32:40.523 --> 32:43.918
Yeah, Enzo and Rosemary had
to go pick you up. I remember.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.313
I'm happy
everyone else is happy.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.010
Enjoy your party.
You know what else

32:49.054 --> 32:51.056
I remember from that Christmas?

32:51.099 --> 32:55.277
Enzo and Rosemary had given
their 30-days' notice.

32:55.321 --> 32:57.497
They had a little place
rented in Boca.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.282
- In Florida?
- That's right.

33:00.326 --> 33:03.024
They talked about it for years.

33:03.068 --> 33:06.462
They gave up on it when they
realized that you needed them.

33:06.506 --> 33:09.988
It turns out the worst
Christmas you ever had,

33:10.031 --> 33:12.294
you got the best gift
anyone could ask for.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.540
- Nick.
- He's not a soldier.

33:40.583 --> 33:41.584
Who?

33:41.628 --> 33:42.803
The guy who I keep seeing

33:42.846 --> 33:44.457
in these PTSD episodes.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.676
He's not a soldier.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.720
He's a fireman.

33:58.253 --> 34:01.082
That's him. Rashad.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.084
The guy I keep watching die.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.002
So what does this mean?

34:08.045 --> 34:11.005
I thought leaving Afghanistan
was causing my PTSD.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.619
But maybe it's coming back
to New York.

34:16.663 --> 34:17.838
9/11?

34:19.882 --> 34:24.366
But you still
can't remember what happened?

34:24.409 --> 34:27.108
Did I say anything?

34:27.152 --> 34:30.068
Back then,
when you saw me again?

34:32.199 --> 34:35.638
I didn't see you for days, Nick.

34:35.681 --> 34:38.728
And you didn't talk
for even longer.

34:40.208 --> 34:44.516
Even when you did, it wasn't
about what you'd seen.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.344
It's like, it's right there
in front of me,

34:46.388 --> 34:48.476
and I justl can't...

34:48.521 --> 34:50.349
I can't break through.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.005
Maybe you need
to process this piece

34:55.049 --> 34:56.529
before you can get to the next.

34:56.572 --> 34:59.097
And how am I supposed
to walk around with this?

35:01.664 --> 35:04.189
What am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

35:08.758 --> 35:11.326
I'm short
a gingerbread-making partner.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.246
I'm not much of a baker.

35:20.553 --> 35:24.557
It's good that you've
been trained to take orders.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.907
Go on. Wash your hands.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.933
Thank you for this.

36:04.249 --> 36:07.252
Might try to keep it away
from open flame.

36:07.295 --> 36:10.037
I added a little something.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.305
You added a lot of something.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.094
Patricia?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.837
Well, well, well.

36:27.881 --> 36:30.231
It's nice to see you two.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.973
No, I'm just passing through.

36:33.016 --> 36:35.367
I'll take that.

36:35.410 --> 36:36.629
You okay?

36:36.672 --> 36:40.720
I'm just taking a moment.
I'll be fine.

36:40.763 --> 36:41.982
Cookie?

36:42.025 --> 36:44.463
Your gingerbread cookies.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.508
I feel better already.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.384
Go on, revel.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.081
I'll be in.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.047
Patricia.

37:04.091 --> 37:05.832
How long have you been out here?

37:05.875 --> 37:07.877
A few minutes.

37:07.921 --> 37:11.533
Your last text
was two hours ago.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.015
I'm sorry.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.417
What did the doctor say?

37:28.898 --> 37:30.509
You knew?

37:33.251 --> 37:36.079
I'm trying to give you
the space you asked me for.

37:36.123 --> 37:40.345
For what it's worth,
it ain't easy.

37:43.565 --> 37:47.439
There are some complications
with my tumor.

37:59.189 --> 38:03.542
You want to go
someplace quiet we can talk?

38:03.585 --> 38:06.240
I want to go to my party.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.111
Baby, you sure?

38:11.332 --> 38:14.466
There's nowhere else
that I would rather be.

38:31.483 --> 38:34.703
Do you know how hard it is to
find a phone book these days?

38:36.096 --> 38:38.098
Nick.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.796
The infamous Gwendolina.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.624
- Call me Dolly.
- Such a pleasure.

38:42.668 --> 38:45.105
You know, I interrogated a
librarian trying to find you.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.890
- What'd I tell you?
- Hi, I'm Sarah.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.458
I've definitely heard that name.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.155
Mostly after
the word "beautiful."

38:53.592 --> 38:56.029
You snagged one of
the last great romantics.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.467
Nice sweater.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.777
I think I saw Dolly in there.
She's a knockout, pops.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.866
Don't get any ideas.

39:06.909 --> 39:10.565
Like sweeping her off to Boca?

39:10.609 --> 39:12.785
Ron told you?

39:12.828 --> 39:17.006
Boca was your nonna's idea.
I could take it or leave it.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.574
You stayed for me.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.010
And you kept us young.

39:21.054 --> 39:22.969
It was a pretty good deal.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.425
I wish I would have known
to thank her

39:24.449 --> 39:25.885
while she was still alive.

39:25.928 --> 39:28.235
I wouldn't let that stop you.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.455
She's a good listener,
your nonna.

39:30.498 --> 39:33.458
You know what our favorite
part of Christmas was?

39:33.501 --> 39:35.416
Mistletoe.

39:37.592 --> 39:38.985
You're a good boy.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.179
I don't think she's coming home.

40:01.703 --> 40:05.838
Tonight, we're going to
choose to hope, you hear me?

41:10.250 --> 41:13.514
- Ava?
- Can I come in?

41:14.305 --> 41:20.533
