- Okay, tell me again how
you first noticed this.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.466
- Just for the past year
or so, sometimes my armpits

01:07.468 --> 01:11.203
have felt kind of lumpy
or kind of swollen.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.672
Sometimes they get like a
little painful once in a while.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.940
It's been weird.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.075
- Well, I've looked
at the ultrasound.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.409
There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.243
- Okay, good.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.611
- [Doctor] Yeah.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.446
- Thank you.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.880
That is a relief.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.482
- You just have some accessory
axillary breast tissue.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.851
- I recognize very few of
the words in that sentence.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.453
- Basically, you
have breast tissue

01:27.455 --> 01:30.155
that has migrated to
your underarm area.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.624
- Jesus Christ.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.892
- That's why
sometimes they might

01:33.894 --> 01:35.294
feel swollen, your armpits.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.895
It's kind of like your breasts
when you're on your period.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.965
- So now, I'm the person
with boobs in my armpits?

01:39.967 --> 01:40.866
(laughs)

01:40.868 --> 01:42.868
- Well, I guess, technically.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.303
You know what?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.271
It's unusual but not
unheard of as you get older.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.606
5% of women get it.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.473
- Oh.

01:48.475 --> 01:49.641
- [Doctor] Yeah.

01:49.643 --> 01:50.542
- So I'm one of
the old lucky ones.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.844
- You are.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.412
- Great, well, I have to
imagine there's a couple

01:53.414 --> 01:55.213
specific websites dedicated
solely to this condition.

01:55.215 --> 01:56.915
Should I start a
webcam in my house?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.483
How do you people usually--

01:58.485 --> 01:59.685
- Let's first see what
you're working with here.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.186
- Well, I'd really
love to monetize it,

02:01.188 --> 02:03.288
so you know, just-- (laughs)

02:03.290 --> 02:07.726
Wow, that's a fun reaction.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.494
- I'm sorry.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.795
- [Andrea] No.

02:09.797 --> 02:10.662
- They're just very cute.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.930
- You mean my arm tits?

02:11.932 --> 02:14.333
I wish I couldn't say I
was proud of that, but

02:14.335 --> 02:16.502
they chose the right host.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.703
- [Doctor] I guess so.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.872
- Ladies, gentlemen,
you're welcome.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.342
(light instrumental music)

02:23.344 --> 02:24.276
- What?

02:24.278 --> 02:25.544
So your breasts just moved.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.812
- No, no, no, Mike,
they didn't move.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.683
I have breast tissue
in my armpits.

02:30.685 --> 02:32.551
So now, I just have extra boobs.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.085
- Wow.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.921
- They're like, you know, the
drawer of extra batteries.

02:35.923 --> 02:39.424
Also, if you put your tongue
on them, they will shock you.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.892
- Do we need to be
worried about this?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.961
- No, my doctor kept
laughing at them.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.295
You don't giggle at cancer.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.564
Oh, thank you.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.432
- So what do we do for, um--

02:47.434 --> 02:48.767
- Arm tits?

02:48.769 --> 02:49.768
That's what I'm
calling them now.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.869
Feel free to join me.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.104
- No.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.006
- I don't technically
have to do anything.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.008
I mean, Ruth said
completely benign,

02:56.010 --> 02:59.077
but it is breast tissue,
which is a little dicey.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.145
- Who's Ruth?

03:00.147 --> 03:00.946
- Dr. Nufeld.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.315
I call her Ruth.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.184
- Did she ask you
to call her that?

03:05.186 --> 03:06.718
- No, she did not.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.388
But Ruth said if I do
want to do something,

03:09.390 --> 03:11.190
my only option is surgery.

03:11.192 --> 03:11.924
- Seriously?

03:11.926 --> 03:12.924
Surgery?
- Yeah.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.761
Oh, thank you again. (laughs)

03:15.763 --> 03:16.795
- [Waiter] Of course.

03:19.666 --> 03:20.866
- Well, I guess
this is what happens

03:20.868 --> 03:22.000
when you're the only
ones in the restaurant.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.202
Very vigilant.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.403
- Apparently.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.373
Anyway, as erotic as
it sounds to have boobs

03:27.375 --> 03:29.541
in your armpits, I think
I'm gonna have the surgery.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.210
- Yeah, I think you should.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.478
- Mike, don't tell
me what to do.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.881
It's my body, my choice.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.416
- Please don't make a scene
in front of all these people.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.819
- Oh, well, well,
well, I didn't know

03:40.821 --> 03:43.021
it was gonna be this
kind of a date night.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.356
- Oh, boy.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.426
Oh, did you get that
email from Mr. Castellati?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.428
- Yeah, the one about
Amelia's ancestry thing?

03:49.430 --> 03:51.362
- So we gotta pick
which side of the family

03:51.364 --> 03:52.231
she's gonna do it on.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.632
- Mmm-hmm.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.567
- Are you ready to order?

03:55.569 --> 03:59.438
- Oh, no, sorry, I was
just looking that way.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.041
No, we will focus.

04:02.043 --> 04:03.375
You need to figure out
what you're getting

04:03.377 --> 04:06.645
because these people
need something to do.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.314
How is no one else eating here?

04:09.316 --> 04:10.582
- I don't know.

04:10.584 --> 04:14.186
(light instrumental music)

04:17.057 --> 04:18.390
- Oh, god.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.058
- All right, for
the next 20 minutes,

04:20.060 --> 04:21.593
we are belly dancing fans.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.195
Put on a face.

04:23.197 --> 04:26.732
(light instrumental music)

04:26.734 --> 04:27.666
Smaller face.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.071
Nice.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.275
(light instrumental music)

04:36.277 --> 04:37.843
Yeah, I'm getting the
surgery in two weeks.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.345
I'm a little nervous, but I
just want to get it over with.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.680
- Yeah, well, it makes sense.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.348
It sounds just like
one of those things

04:43.350 --> 04:44.816
that happens when
we get older, honey.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.884
- Wow.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.620
- Dad, I am just
approaching aging, okay.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.855
You've already
bought her a drink

04:49.857 --> 04:51.623
and are fondling
her under the bar.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.425
- A couple of drinks.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.893
- Gross.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.228
All right, are you ready
for Amelia to interview you

04:56.230 --> 04:58.630
about the Warren family history?

04:58.632 --> 04:59.631
- Yep, all set.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.632
Wait a minute.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.267
What is is I'm supposed to do?

05:02.269 --> 05:03.835
- Just remember stuff.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.237
Do whatever you need to
do for that, all right.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.506
Pull out some old pictures.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.640
- Look at a family tree.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.908
- You like drugs.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.276
Take some heroin.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.645
Get those synapses
firing on all cylinders.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.981
- Heroin is not
for focus, honey.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.117
- Super cool, Dad,
all right, well,

05:18.119 --> 05:20.119
I leave it up to your
drug addled discretion.

05:20.121 --> 05:21.320
I'll see you tomorrow, okay.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.121
- [Martin] Bye.

05:22.123 --> 05:23.322
- [Andrea] Bye.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.990
- You're going to see
your dad tomorrow?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.459
- Yep, Amelia's interviewing
him for her project.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.528
- When do I get to
do my interview?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.730
- Oh, Mom, don't worry.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.133
You will get your moment
in the sun, all right.

05:34.135 --> 05:35.501
David's gonna be there, too.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.935
Can you do next Saturday?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.670
- Yeah, I can do
Saturday just as long as

05:38.672 --> 05:42.341
I'm home by five, so I can...

05:42.343 --> 05:44.910
- Feed your husband
dinner in bed?

05:44.912 --> 05:46.745
- Why do you make
it sound so weird?

05:46.747 --> 05:49.114
- Sharon, is there another
way to make it sound?

05:49.116 --> 05:52.685
- Mom, Gloria Steinem is
rolling over in her grave.

05:52.687 --> 05:54.486
- Gloria Steinem is not dead.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.754
- Yeah, she is.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.922
I called her and told
her about feeding Leon,

05:56.924 --> 05:58.223
and she killed herself.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.693
Thanks for murdering an
American treasure, Mom.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.961
- Well, you shouldn't
have bothered her with it.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.831
- Hindsight, I
didn't know she would

06:05.833 --> 06:07.699
take it so much to heart.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.967
Although, I'll be honest.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.502
I get the instinct,
you know what I mean?

06:10.504 --> 06:11.970
- No.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.273
- I considered offing myself
over this a couple of times.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.142
What does he wear again
when you feed him?

06:17.144 --> 06:18.177
- [Sharon] Nothing.

06:20.981 --> 06:24.983
tal music)
What does he wear again
when you feed him?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.151
- [Martin] Hi.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.152
- Hello.
- Grampy.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.387
- Hey, Pumpkin, ah.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.355
Do you want to learn
about the Warrens?

06:30.357 --> 06:31.356
- Yeah.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.558
- Okay.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.558
- Okay, again, all
conversations take

06:33.560 --> 06:35.027
place further in the house.

06:35.029 --> 06:36.028
We have discussed this.

06:36.030 --> 06:37.429
Keep it moving.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.097
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here

06:39.099 --> 06:40.965
next to the erotic photography.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.168
- Oh, dad.
- Speaking of photography,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.437
I pulled out a bunch
of photos for you.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.906
- Oh, who is this guy?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.508
I haven't seen
this photo before.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.610
A choo choo choo
choo, Dan La Roocha.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.779
Give me, give me smoocha.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.647
- Well, that's my father.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.618
- I'm gonna pull back
one of my choo chas.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.053
I'll still throw
him a roocha though.

07:01.055 --> 07:02.655
Jesus.
- Yeah, he was handsome.

07:02.657 --> 07:04.423
- Oh, my god, very.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.659
- I guess this makes more
sense to you know, huh?

07:06.661 --> 07:07.726
- You being adopted?

07:07.728 --> 07:08.861
Yeah, it's tracking.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.128
Oh, you know what?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.064
Actually, because
Grampy's adopted,

07:12.066 --> 07:14.033
it makes his ancestry
a little more exciting

07:14.035 --> 07:16.602
'cause his adopted parents,
they were American.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.271
But his birth parents
were from Greece,

07:19.273 --> 07:22.641
which is why you love
feta cheese and olives

07:22.643 --> 07:26.278
and dark chocolate 'cause
it's in your blood.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.213
- Well, you can continue
to love those things,

07:28.215 --> 07:29.248
but I've got news for you.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.482
I am not Greek.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.950
- What?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.687
- I did one of those
ancestry DNA tests, and--

07:35.556 --> 07:37.089
- [Andrea] What? When?

07:37.091 --> 07:38.223
- I don't know.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.224
About six months
ago, I sent it in.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.825
- Six months ago?

07:40.827 --> 07:43.028
- Sent me back the paperwork
and said you are not Greek.

07:43.030 --> 07:48.033
But I am almost 100% Polish.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.569
- Dad, what is
happening right now?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.470
- I'm sorry.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.105
I thought I mentioned it.

07:53.107 --> 07:56.241
- No, you went on at length
about your new solar powered

07:56.243 --> 07:59.311
outdoor lighting, but
somehow this little detail

07:59.313 --> 08:01.980
slipped your mind
for six months.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.782
- Hmm, I'm sorry.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.983
- I'm so confused.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.785
Why did we even
think we were Greek?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.053
Where did that even come from?

08:08.055 --> 08:09.455
- I don't know.

08:09.457 --> 08:10.923
Somebody must have
screwed up the paperwork.

08:10.925 --> 08:14.059
- All right, your casualness
about this is unnerving.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.194
- Oh, I've had more time
to wrap my head around it.

08:16.196 --> 08:20.132
- Okay, Dad, if Amelia
didn't have this project,

08:20.134 --> 08:23.502
how long would I have gone on
believing that I was Greek?

08:23.504 --> 08:26.071
- Well, I'm sure it would have
come up before the holidays.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.072
- Which holidays?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.873
Thanksgiving or Greek Easter?

08:28.875 --> 08:30.676
- Oh, I wouldn't want
to ruin Greek Easter.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.145
- Okay, well, now we've
got Polish Easter.

08:33.147 --> 08:36.515
So I imagine it's a much
more subdued affair.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.083
- I've been in Poland at Easter.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.618
They go out with a basket full
of eggs and throw them away.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.687
(laughs)

08:43.824 --> 08:45.557
Just the opposite you see.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.625
- Is that a Polish joke?

08:46.627 --> 08:47.760
- [Martin] Yeah.

08:47.762 --> 08:50.529
- Even if you're Polish,
those aren't okay.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.631
- Okay, but one must
laugh at oneself.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.767
Remember that.

08:54.769 --> 08:56.535
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.369
Great.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.305
I honestly, I still
cannot believe it.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.308
I mean, I did a foreign
exchange program in Athens.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.712
I made you follow Greece's
national soccer team.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.980
- They are not good.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.949
- No, I mean I gave
blow jobs to people

09:10.951 --> 09:12.384
just because they were Greek.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.352
- No, you didn't.

09:13.354 --> 09:14.586
- No, I didn't, but I mean,

09:14.588 --> 09:17.522
I strongly considered
it sometimes.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.325
I don't want to make it
like the end of the world,

09:19.327 --> 09:22.661
but this was like my one spice.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.196
- Yeah, it's weird
looking at you now.

09:24.198 --> 09:26.931
I like being married to
an exotic Greek woman.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.735
- Well, now, you're married to
a Polish lady with arm tits.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.604
It's kind of different
sturdier kind of exotic.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.806
(laughs)

09:33.808 --> 09:35.874
Oh, hey, my surgery is offish

09:35.876 --> 09:37.743
confirmed for nine
a.m. on Thursday.

09:37.745 --> 09:38.811
Can you take me?

09:38.813 --> 09:39.978
- Of course, the 12th?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.181
- Oh, crap, is that the 12th?

09:42.183 --> 09:43.415
- [Mike] Mmm-hmm.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.616
- That's the morning
that her school's

09:44.618 --> 09:46.819
having that pancake breakfast.

09:46.821 --> 09:48.153
- Maybe your mom can take her.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.022
- No, I don't want us
both not to be there.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.423
Why don't you and
my mom go to that,

09:51.425 --> 09:52.825
and I'll see if
David can take me.

09:52.827 --> 09:54.893
- Okay, but I'm gonna
come take you home.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.962
- All right, also keep
in mind, after Friday,

09:56.964 --> 10:00.165
I'm gonna have the
armpits of a 16-year-old.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.633
- Is that something I want?

10:01.635 --> 10:03.301
- You'll be able to
bounce a quarter off them.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.969
- Is that something I want?

10:04.971 --> 10:07.206
- I mean, I just assume
now, my life is gonna be me

10:07.208 --> 10:12.044
in sleeveless shirts, you
know, just tons of high fives.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.378
- [Mike] Oh, yeah.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.046
- Maybe I'll join a
bird watching club.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.214
- Oh.

10:15.216 --> 10:16.181
- I don't want to learn
a lot about birds,

10:16.183 --> 10:18.583
but I'll just be like, bird.

10:18.585 --> 10:21.786
This is gonna create a lot
more job opportunities for me.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.989
You're probably not gonna see
me much after this happens.

10:23.991 --> 10:27.626
(light instrumental music)

10:27.628 --> 10:29.261
Daviday, do you want
something to drink?

10:29.263 --> 10:30.829
- Do you have any kombucha?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.065
- No, I do not, and assume
that will be my answer

10:33.067 --> 10:35.834
from now until the end of days.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.303
- You know, Mom, I'd love to
take a look at that family tree

10:38.305 --> 10:40.439
and see how I'm
related to this beast.

10:40.441 --> 10:42.841
- That's 'cause this one
greeted everyone vagina first.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.043
- Oh, god.
- All right,

10:44.045 --> 10:45.477
we're gonna talk about
Mom's filthy habits

10:45.479 --> 10:48.180
when I take all five of
you on Thursday, okay.

10:48.182 --> 10:49.415
- I don't get it.

10:49.417 --> 10:52.284
- Well, I just mean
your two regular boobs

10:52.286 --> 10:53.619
and then you got
two extra boobs.

10:53.621 --> 10:56.221
And then you, yourself,
the stem of the boobs.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.089
- I still don't get it.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.490
What do you mean?

10:58.492 --> 10:59.425
- I'm just gonna put it in
a different way for you.

10:59.427 --> 11:00.959
- Yeah, no, break it down.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.828
- Those things that are on
your chest are called boobs.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.430
- There are other
people in the room.

11:04.432 --> 11:06.665
- Well, do those people have--

11:06.667 --> 11:07.832
- Hi, Grammy

11:07.834 --> 11:08.767
Uncle David.
- Hi.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.903
- Uh, Mom, you're up.

11:10.905 --> 11:11.837
Prepare to dazzle.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.305
- All right.
- Oh, good.

11:13.307 --> 11:14.039
You got your folder.

11:14.041 --> 11:14.873
- I'm ready for you.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.575
- Okay, look at this.

11:16.577 --> 11:19.244
- Now, these are my
four grandparents.

11:19.246 --> 11:23.648
This is Grandpa Heinrich
who was born in 1855,

11:23.650 --> 11:26.919
and this is Grandma
Annalise, born in 1891.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.520
And these are my
other grandparents--

11:28.522 --> 11:31.323
- Wait, how old was Annalise
when they got married?

11:31.325 --> 11:35.193
- Oh, well, they got
married in 1905, so--

11:35.195 --> 11:36.628
- So she was 14.

11:36.630 --> 11:37.663
- Yeah,

11:37.665 --> 11:39.131
- And he was like 55.
- Yeah.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.366
- Oh.

11:40.368 --> 11:41.233
- It was a different time.

11:41.235 --> 11:42.568
- A time of pedophilia?

11:42.570 --> 11:43.835
- [Sharon] Oh, stop it.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.505
- Mom, we need to go
back 1,000 generations.

11:46.507 --> 11:49.641
Your parents will be
old enough I am sure.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.576
- Fine.

11:50.578 --> 11:51.543
Now, these are my parents.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.945
- I love this picture.

11:52.947 --> 11:54.413
- It's a great picture. (laughs)

11:54.415 --> 11:57.516
Okay, this is Great Grandma
Ava and Great Grandpa Peter,

11:57.518 --> 11:58.951
and they were born in Germany.

11:58.953 --> 12:01.086
- This is Uncle David's
and my grandparents.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.521
When did they move
to California?

12:02.523 --> 12:05.223
- Well, they briefly moved to
Buenos Aires after the war,

12:05.225 --> 12:08.160
and then they came to
California in 1947,

12:08.162 --> 12:10.829
which is where I was
born, which makes you,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.766
one, two, three, third
generation Californian.

12:13.768 --> 12:16.701
- So things weren't going
well for Grandma and Grandpa

12:16.703 --> 12:18.170
in Germany after World War II,

12:18.172 --> 12:20.505
and then they went to Argentina?

12:20.507 --> 12:23.308
- Mmm-hmm, I think they
had an opportunity there.

12:23.310 --> 12:27.346
- Mom, what side
were your parents on?

12:27.348 --> 12:29.581
Were they traveling
to Argentina?

12:29.583 --> 12:31.350
Or were they fleeing?

12:31.352 --> 12:32.551
- Fleeing?

12:32.553 --> 12:35.053
- Well, there was a
certain group of people

12:35.055 --> 12:38.557
who after the war had
to take a vacation

12:38.559 --> 12:41.794
to Argentina in order to--

12:41.796 --> 12:42.828
- Lay low.

12:42.830 --> 12:43.695
- [David] Yeah.

12:43.697 --> 12:44.930
- Oh, my god.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.498
- Yeah.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.335
- Well, I don't think the kids
are gonna notice the dates.

12:49.337 --> 12:50.602
- I don't think
the children will,

12:50.604 --> 12:52.738
but Mr. Castellati's
mustache tells me

12:52.740 --> 12:55.174
he's very well-versed
in war crime trivia.

12:55.176 --> 13:00.179
Mom, let's just start your
family tree, Los Angeles, 1947.

13:01.382 --> 13:02.747
- Okay, I have a lot of
good things about that.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.149
(laughs)

13:04.151 --> 13:06.285
- Well, anything will be better
than what you just revealed.

13:07.488 --> 13:10.088
Is this one of their relatives?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.190
- I don't know who that is.

13:11.192 --> 13:13.192
She has a certain--

13:13.194 --> 13:14.994
- German look?

13:14.996 --> 13:16.395
(laughs)

13:16.397 --> 13:19.965
I just feel like she's
probably close related to Ava.

13:21.868 --> 13:24.336
nstrumental music)
(laughs)

13:24.338 --> 13:25.804
I'm gonna be honest.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.340
I'm not sure Amelia's
presentation can rest solely

13:28.342 --> 13:30.208
on my mom's Van Nuys
High School years.

13:30.210 --> 13:34.113
I feel like her near miss
pregnancy her senior year

13:34.115 --> 13:36.481
of high school is just
like an opener at best.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.483
- Poland's starting to
look like our best bet.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.586
- Not a sentence that
rolls off the tongue.

13:40.588 --> 13:41.920
- Noted.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.756
- Why is this tank
top in my hands?

13:43.758 --> 13:45.090
- I don't know.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.291
I must have thrown
it in the hamper.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.026
- Were you looking for
the trash but missed?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.763
Why is this even in our lives?

13:50.765 --> 13:51.764
- I don't know.

13:51.766 --> 13:52.765
Just give it to me.

13:52.767 --> 13:53.499
Come on.

13:53.501 --> 13:55.033
- Oh, my god.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.502
- By the way, I can be at
the hospital by 11 tomorrow.

13:56.504 --> 13:57.702
- Oh, perfect.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.937
I actually will
probably still be under.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.540
It is a three hour surgery.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.508
- Three hours?

14:02.510 --> 14:03.542
Jesus.

14:03.544 --> 14:04.543
- I know.

14:04.545 --> 14:06.044
I don't love it.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.546
Just know that if I do
not make it through alive,

14:07.548 --> 14:10.983
which is an option, I want
you to find someone else.

14:10.985 --> 14:12.117
- [Mike] Oh, great.

14:12.119 --> 14:15.321
- But like, uncomfortably fast.

14:15.323 --> 14:16.855
- Thank you.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.391
- Like, I want you to bring
a plus one to my funeral.

14:19.393 --> 14:21.460
Really get people talkin'.

14:21.462 --> 14:24.196
- Oh, I think people
will be okay with it.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.464
- That's fair.

14:25.466 --> 14:29.601
You know, tonight
is your last night

14:29.603 --> 14:31.203
with a four-breasted woman.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.471
- [Mike] Mmm-hmm.

14:32.473 --> 14:33.939
- So maybe you have
a couple of things

14:33.941 --> 14:36.542
that you've thought about trying

14:36.544 --> 14:38.143
but have been too
nervous to ask.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.544
- I think I'm gonna pass.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.013
- Yeah, you know what?

14:41.015 --> 14:44.149
You might want to rest up
because after the surgery,

14:44.151 --> 14:46.385
I'm gonna be buying some
pretty sexy lingerie

14:46.387 --> 14:49.688
to accentuate what I'm gonna
be bringing to the table.

14:49.690 --> 14:51.223
- Yeah, like what?

14:51.225 --> 14:53.826
- I imagine it's just like
turtleneck with holes,

14:53.828 --> 14:56.428
kind of like crotchless
panties but for arm pits.

14:56.430 --> 14:59.164
- Are you purposely trying to
make me not attracted to you?

14:59.166 --> 15:00.899
- Yes, I do.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.801
Is it working?

15:02.803 --> 15:05.504
- I never understood
why that's a goal.

15:05.506 --> 15:07.706
- I feel like it's obvious.

15:07.708 --> 15:08.574
- It's not.

15:08.576 --> 15:09.842
- It's not?

15:09.844 --> 15:10.776
What if every night
when I get into bed,

15:10.778 --> 15:11.977
I just go (smacks) (laughs).

15:12.813 --> 15:14.379
- I might like that.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.815
- Oh, fuck, you make this
very difficult actually.

15:16.817 --> 15:20.653
(light instrumental music)

15:20.655 --> 15:22.021
What are you saying to me?

15:22.023 --> 15:24.456
What do you mean you
don't do fiction?

15:24.458 --> 15:26.725
- Well, look, I don't
like narratives.

15:26.727 --> 15:27.860
- [Andrea] Oh, Jesus.

15:27.862 --> 15:29.061
- They're distracting
to me, and I can

15:29.063 --> 15:30.262
never relate to
the main character.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.798
- Wait, you watch every
Jason Statham movie?

15:32.800 --> 15:35.600
The Transporter,
that's a character you
feel a kinship with?

15:35.602 --> 15:38.136
- His name is Frank Martin.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.672
- If I like down in
the street right now,

15:39.674 --> 15:42.340
do you promise to
back up over me?

15:42.342 --> 15:43.608
- [David] I'm not
gonna kill you, no.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.811
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
for real right now?

15:45.813 --> 15:47.079
Look at this.

15:47.081 --> 15:48.881
- Pull up, pull up, pull up.

15:48.883 --> 15:50.416
Jesus Christ, come on.

15:52.286 --> 15:53.752
Hi, excuse me.

15:53.754 --> 15:56.455
We were actually waiting for
this spot if you could move.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.424
- What, you don't see us?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.026
Ma'am, we're blocking your door.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.628
- You can't get out.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.296
- There's nowhere for you to go.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.899
- I know that you
can hear and see me.

16:06.901 --> 16:08.434
I'm looking right at you.

16:08.436 --> 16:09.434
Hello?

16:09.436 --> 16:10.769
Okay, well, we're not moving,

16:10.771 --> 16:12.837
so I don't know where
we go from here?

16:12.839 --> 16:15.039
Are you shitting me?

16:15.041 --> 16:15.908
Dude?

16:15.910 --> 16:16.841
- No.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.643
- You're crawling out of your--

16:18.645 --> 16:19.778
- You can't do that.

16:19.780 --> 16:20.645
- That was our spot.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.314
Just take another spot.

16:22.316 --> 16:23.649
What the fuck?

16:23.651 --> 16:24.716
- Jesus Christ.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.118
- [Andrea] Fuck you.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.319
- [David] I guess that's it.

16:27.321 --> 16:28.854
I'm gonna spend
another ten minutes

16:28.856 --> 16:29.854
looking for a parking spot.

16:29.856 --> 16:30.889
- I guess that's our life.

16:31.726 --> 16:32.991
You know what?

16:32.993 --> 16:36.095
I'm starting to see
how we're related.

16:36.097 --> 16:37.529
It's our fury.

16:37.531 --> 16:38.397
- Aw.

16:38.399 --> 16:40.532
- That German blood.

16:40.534 --> 16:43.902
- Those relatives
were really mad.

16:43.904 --> 16:46.338
- I think we can agree
they took things too far.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.473
- Yes.

16:47.475 --> 16:48.674
- Not to ruin our Nazi fun,

16:48.676 --> 16:50.675
but you actually
don't have to park.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.810
You can just drop
me off in front.

16:51.812 --> 16:53.145
It's fine.

16:53.147 --> 16:54.279
- Get the hell out of here.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.814
- In the mid, you're not
even gonna pull over?

16:56.951 --> 16:58.083
All right, fine.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.351
- We're good.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.352
- Bye.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.353
- [David] Bye.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.287
- Bye, bye.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.423
- Five stars, five stars please.

17:04.425 --> 17:08.360
(light instrumental music)

17:08.362 --> 17:09.094
- Hi, Ms. Warren.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.362
I'm Dr. Walsh.

17:10.364 --> 17:11.163
I'll be your
anesthesiologist today.

17:11.165 --> 17:12.564
- Oh, wonderful, hi.

17:12.566 --> 17:13.899
- So I'm in charge of
putting you to sleep

17:13.901 --> 17:15.900
and arguably more important,
bringing you back out.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.035
- Well, there's no rush.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.103
I took the whole day so--

17:18.105 --> 17:19.972
- Lucky you.

17:19.974 --> 17:20.939
What do you do?

17:20.941 --> 17:22.307
- I'm in comedy.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.908
I'm a writer.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.177
- Oh, really, you know who
I just recently put under?

17:25.179 --> 17:26.178
Eddie Murphy.

17:26.180 --> 17:29.247
- Oh, cool.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.783
- You remember Delirious?

17:30.785 --> 17:31.850
- I do.

17:31.852 --> 17:33.152
- Holds up.

17:33.154 --> 17:34.353
- Does it?

17:34.355 --> 17:37.523
- Lemonade, that cool
refreshing drink.

17:37.525 --> 17:39.057
- That was a good bit.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.561
A lot of it hasn't aged
as gracefully I would say.

17:42.563 --> 17:43.528
- Morning.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.797
How are you?
- Hi.

17:44.799 --> 17:45.731
- How are you feeling?

17:45.733 --> 17:46.999
- Ah, good, a little nervous.

17:47.001 --> 17:50.002
Ready to bid these
friends adieu.

17:50.004 --> 17:51.203
- I'm sure.

17:51.205 --> 17:52.337
Well, I'm just
gonna mark you up,

17:52.339 --> 17:53.672
and then we'll be ready to go.

17:53.674 --> 17:54.939
- Oh, okay, yeah.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.208
- I'll give you
guys some privacy.

17:56.210 --> 17:57.609
- Oh, thank you.

17:57.611 --> 17:59.211
I mean, you're gonna see it
all in ten minutes anyway,

17:59.213 --> 18:01.013
but I'll be drugged,
which makes it better.

18:01.015 --> 18:02.280
You know what I mean?

18:02.282 --> 18:03.782
So feel free to
really load it up.

18:03.784 --> 18:06.351
- I will put you
on the high octane.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.619
- Well, he's lovely.

18:07.621 --> 18:08.354
- Yeah.

18:08.356 --> 18:09.554
- All right.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.356
(laughs)

18:10.358 --> 18:11.590
- Sorry.

18:11.592 --> 18:14.360
- Dr. Nufeld, my eyes
are up here, please.

18:14.362 --> 18:15.194
- [Doctor] Okay.

18:15.196 --> 18:16.028
- How dare you.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.999
tal music)
- [Doctor] Okay.

18:20.001 --> 18:21.400
- Honey, how are you feeling?

18:21.402 --> 18:22.401
- Pretty good.

18:22.403 --> 18:24.936
A little, mmm, a little thirsty.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.006
- Why don't I get your
wife some ice chips?

18:27.008 --> 18:27.940
- Thanks.

18:27.942 --> 18:31.143
- Oh, your wife.

18:31.145 --> 18:32.944
Your wife's a
bigfoot, isn't she?

18:32.946 --> 18:34.546
- What?

18:34.548 --> 18:37.082
- That's why the
bitch's mustache is
so motherfucking thick

18:37.084 --> 18:40.185
'cause you shaved the bitch
down and taught her to speak.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.554
- What is happening right now?

18:42.556 --> 18:43.555
- Remember?

18:43.557 --> 18:45.824
Eddie Murphy, Delirious?

18:45.826 --> 18:47.092
Holds up?

18:47.094 --> 18:48.227
- I don't think I
was there for that.

18:48.229 --> 18:50.229
Dr. Nufeld will be right in.

18:50.231 --> 18:52.764
- Thank you.

18:52.766 --> 18:55.767
Oh. (laughs)

18:55.769 --> 18:58.103
I will say if Dr.
Walsh had been here,

18:58.105 --> 18:59.405
that would have killed.

18:59.407 --> 19:00.305
- Oh, okay.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.440
- Oh, ow.

19:01.442 --> 19:02.908
- Lie back down.

19:02.910 --> 19:04.109
- Okay, oh.

19:04.111 --> 19:05.577
- I don't know if
you'll remember this,

19:05.579 --> 19:06.978
but I spoke with the
doctor after the surgery,

19:06.980 --> 19:08.580
and she said that
everything went very well.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.449
- Oh, good, okay, good, good.

19:10.451 --> 19:12.584
- And one thing
she did recommend

19:12.586 --> 19:14.820
for your recovery is butt sex.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.722
- Really?

19:16.724 --> 19:18.624
Wow, well, that's
unconventional.

19:18.626 --> 19:19.658
- That's what I said?

19:19.660 --> 19:20.826
- Did you?

19:20.828 --> 19:21.827
- Yeah.
- You said that?

19:21.829 --> 19:22.995
- I said, that's unconventional.

19:22.997 --> 19:24.263
- Wow.
- But then she's the doctor.

19:24.265 --> 19:26.031
- Yeah, no, obviously,
she's excellent.

19:26.033 --> 19:27.232
I would never second guess her.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.467
You know, when
she comes back in,

19:28.469 --> 19:29.435
I'll just have her
walk me through it.

19:29.437 --> 19:30.869
- Oh, no, no, no.

19:30.871 --> 19:32.004
We don't need to
bother her with that.

19:32.006 --> 19:33.538
- I don't think she's
gonna be bothered by it.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.407
I feel like, you know, this
is kind of what she does.

19:35.409 --> 19:36.408
- It was super straight forward.

19:36.410 --> 19:37.409
- Okay.

19:37.411 --> 19:38.277
- She was like, butt sex--

19:38.279 --> 19:39.445
- Butt sex.

19:39.447 --> 19:40.279
- And that's all you need.

19:40.281 --> 19:41.213
- You know, great.

19:41.215 --> 19:42.681
- Good, you're up.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.083
How are you feeling?

19:44.085 --> 19:45.350
- I think pretty good.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.952
I'm a little sore but good.

19:46.954 --> 19:50.055
- Well, I'm really pleased
with how everything went, yeah.

19:50.057 --> 19:51.857
In fact, you can just head home

19:51.859 --> 19:53.258
as soon as you're
feeling up to it.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.559
I'll see you back
here in two weeks.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.027
- Perfect, thank you.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.496
Oh, actually, Mike,
didn't you have something

19:57.498 --> 19:59.031
that you wanted
to ask Dr. Nufeld?

19:59.033 --> 20:00.231
- No.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.033
- Really?

20:01.035 --> 20:02.301
Really?

20:02.303 --> 20:03.302
Something about my
recovery process?

20:03.304 --> 20:06.038
Sorry, I'm still
a little groggy.

20:06.040 --> 20:09.775
Just repeat back to me
verbatim what you said earlier.

20:09.777 --> 20:11.243
- Uh, I just, hmm.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.414
- I mean, like right before
the doctor walked in.

20:15.416 --> 20:17.316
- I don't know what
you're referring to.

20:17.318 --> 20:18.617
- It was something.

20:18.619 --> 20:22.688
It was an unconventional
recovery prescription.

20:22.690 --> 20:23.522
- Unconventional
recovery prescription?

20:23.524 --> 20:24.356
- Icing?

20:24.358 --> 20:25.691
- Icing, lots of icing.

20:25.693 --> 20:26.892
Yeah, we'll do some icing.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.493
We'll do some--

20:28.495 --> 20:31.496
- Was there any icing for like
other different parts of my

20:31.498 --> 20:35.000
body that you wouldn't normally
associate with this surgery?

20:35.002 --> 20:37.536
Like, on the more
backside of my body?

20:37.538 --> 20:38.937
- [Doctor] No.

20:38.939 --> 20:40.272
- We can email you later
if we have any questions.

20:40.274 --> 20:41.340
- Okay, all right.

20:41.342 --> 20:42.474
- Thank you so much.

20:42.476 --> 20:43.075
- If we remember,
we'll email you.

20:43.077 --> 20:44.276
- Great.

20:44.278 --> 20:45.511
That's perfect.

20:45.513 --> 20:46.845
- Thank you again.
- Thank you so much.

20:48.716 --> 20:50.682
I wonder what happens
if I pull this plug.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.485
- I come back bigger
and better than ever.

20:53.487 --> 20:55.921
- Mmm, maybe then this plug?

20:55.923 --> 20:57.956
- No, that one kills me.

20:57.958 --> 20:59.091
Then I will be dead.

20:59.093 --> 21:02.695
(light instrumental music)

21:03.964 --> 21:05.364
- Here you go.

21:05.366 --> 21:06.298
- Thank you.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.432
- Do you want anything else?

21:07.434 --> 21:08.633
Are you comfortable?

21:08.635 --> 21:10.569
- Other than feeling
like my armpits

21:10.571 --> 21:14.573
have been replaced with
lime covered cheese graters,

21:14.575 --> 21:16.708
(sighs) I'm doing all right.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.178
- I will say your
condition seemed

21:19.180 --> 21:21.180
to have wowed the surgical ward.

21:21.182 --> 21:22.715
- Yeah, I know.

21:22.717 --> 21:25.017
I didn't love how every
single nurse on the floor

21:25.019 --> 21:28.120
at some point
stopped in to say hi.

21:28.122 --> 21:29.388
- Yeah.

21:29.390 --> 21:30.556
- A hospital is not
the place where I want

21:30.558 --> 21:32.290
to be considered interesting.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.158
- [Mike] No.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.193
- Oh, god.

21:34.195 --> 21:35.761
- Just put your iPad down.

21:35.763 --> 21:37.730
You're not supposed
to move your arms.

21:37.732 --> 21:38.997
- I know.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.331
I have to find a recipe
that's interesting

21:40.333 --> 21:42.801
to six-year-olds for
Amelia's Polish presentation.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.169
'Cause I will tell you.

21:44.171 --> 21:46.805
Their clothes and music are
not lighting the world on fire.

21:46.807 --> 21:48.673
I'm starting to run
out of Polish things

21:48.675 --> 21:49.941
to pretend to give a shit about.

21:49.943 --> 21:52.211
- Isn't there a Polish
treat or something?

21:52.213 --> 21:55.447
- There's like a donut thing
called a pass-key or pash-key.

21:56.617 --> 21:57.949
- Do you know how
to make donuts?

21:57.951 --> 22:01.186
- Yeah, Mike, I know how
to make a fucking donut.

22:01.188 --> 22:02.487
- Okay.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.589
- No, I do not know.
- I don't think so.

22:03.591 --> 22:07.593
- But it's eggs,
sugar, salt, confiture.

22:07.595 --> 22:09.161
What is confiture?

22:09.163 --> 22:10.696
- Oh, I don't know.

22:10.698 --> 22:13.399
- Oh, my god, I cannot take on
a specialty store right now.

22:13.401 --> 22:15.366
Confiture?

22:15.368 --> 22:17.169
- Hi, honey, how
are you feeling?

22:17.171 --> 22:18.704
- Hi, Mom.

22:18.706 --> 22:20.105
A little better.

22:20.107 --> 22:22.241
Oh, fuck my ass.

22:22.243 --> 22:23.609
- Well.

22:23.611 --> 22:27.279
- Sorry, apparently, it's part
of my prescribed recovery.

22:27.281 --> 22:28.247
Ask Mike.

22:28.249 --> 22:29.782
He knows all the details.

22:29.784 --> 22:30.949
- Nope, not going to.

22:30.951 --> 22:33.318
- Mom, I need you.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.988
Are those the words that
send tingles up your spine.

22:36.990 --> 22:40.392
- Finally, it warms the
shackles of my heart.

22:40.394 --> 22:41.593
- The shackles?

22:41.595 --> 22:44.596
- Cockles, it warms the
cockles of my heart.

22:44.598 --> 22:46.798
- By the way, shackles
makes more sense.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.469
Okay, Mom, Poland is a disaster.

22:50.471 --> 22:51.837
I know obviously
we have to avoid

22:51.839 --> 22:54.673
all mention of your
mom's side of the family,

22:54.675 --> 22:56.241
but what about your dad's?

22:56.243 --> 22:57.609
What do you got?

22:57.611 --> 22:58.877
- Oh, no, I don't think that's

22:58.879 --> 23:00.212
the direction that
you want to go.

23:00.214 --> 23:01.413
- Okay, why?

23:01.415 --> 23:04.750
- Well, you know, my
grandfather on that side

23:04.752 --> 23:07.619
had a rather large tobacco farm

23:07.621 --> 23:09.088
outside of Richmond, Virginia.

23:09.090 --> 23:12.491
And it was labor intensive.

23:12.493 --> 23:13.358
- [Mike] Oh, my god.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.225
- What?

23:14.227 --> 23:15.627
Okay, you know what?

23:15.629 --> 23:18.764
If I don't commit a sex crime
and I don't murder anyone,

23:18.766 --> 23:20.499
no one's ever going
to check my DNA.

23:20.501 --> 23:21.366
We're Greek.

23:21.368 --> 23:22.634
I'm making baklava.

23:22.636 --> 23:24.036
- I think that's
the right choice.

23:24.038 --> 23:26.972
- Yes, and Mom, this was
on you to end your family's

23:26.974 --> 23:29.641
international reign of terror.

23:29.643 --> 23:30.876
I'm glad David and I exist,

23:30.878 --> 23:33.712
but you really should
have died childless.

23:33.714 --> 23:34.847
- It's not too late.

23:36.717 --> 23:39.118
- Are you planning on
murdering me and David?

23:39.120 --> 23:40.853
- Well, don't worry about it.

23:40.855 --> 23:42.721
- Oh, sounds like
you might get your

23:42.723 --> 23:45.056
plus one sooner
rather than later.

23:45.058 --> 23:46.458
- Sounds like it. (laughs)

23:46.460 --> 23:49.261
- Just so you know, I have
a couple of names out,

23:49.263 --> 23:52.798
but they are
uncomfortably young.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.500
- Great, looking forward to it.

23:54.502 --> 23:56.468
- Okay, you might
know a few of them

23:56.470 --> 23:57.936
'cause they're in
Amelia's class.

23:57.938 --> 24:00.339
- I don't think you
should joke about that.

24:00.341 --> 24:03.408
(light instrumental music)

24:03.410 --> 24:05.277
- And that's why I
like being Greek.

24:05.279 --> 24:07.713
And in Greece, they
love to dance, opa.

24:09.350 --> 24:10.749
- They do like to dance.

24:10.751 --> 24:11.616
That is true.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.551
We love to dance.

24:12.553 --> 24:14.720
(light instrumental music)

24:14.722 --> 24:16.488
- We definitely made
the right decision.

24:16.490 --> 24:19.624
(light instrumental music)

24:19.626 --> 24:21.092
- You know, if I
didn't know better,

24:21.094 --> 24:24.563
I would say Amelia's had a
little work done in this region.

24:24.565 --> 24:25.931
- I'm not doing this.

24:25.933 --> 24:28.534
- There's no way
those pits are real.

24:28.536 --> 24:29.568
(light instrumental music)

24:29.570 --> 24:30.703
I should have used her doctor.

24:30.705 --> 24:32.171
I really messed up
going with Ruth.

24:32.173 --> 24:32.871
(light instrumental music)
