                 Previously
Riverdale...

00:02.419 --> 00:04.003
      Do you see those people
over there?

00:04.044 --> 00:05.421
     They're Dodger's family.

00:05.463 --> 00:07.589
            I'm not sure
what you're here for,

00:07.631 --> 00:09.175
       but you and your boys
need to leave.

00:09.217 --> 00:11.176
       We've got kids here,
we don't want any trouble.

00:11.218 --> 00:13.679
    Mr. DuPont, the first book
in the Baxter Brothers series,

00:13.721 --> 00:15.515
  was written by my grandfather.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.890
         I killed Caramel.

00:16.932 --> 00:20.228
    No, Betty, that wasn't you,

00:20.269 --> 00:22.605
       that was your deeply
screwed-up dad.

00:22.646 --> 00:24.356
         Someone is trying
to drive me mad.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.443
        But, once I find out
who this depraved monster is,

00:27.484 --> 00:29.653
      I will unleash a wrath
upon them so wicked,

00:29.696 --> 00:32.281
           they will wish
they had been consumed
in their mother's womb.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.200
          You've reached
the Riverdale hotline.

00:34.241 --> 00:37.536
  If you wish to report a problem
in your neighborhood,
leave a message.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.206
     Anonymity is your choice.
We're here to help.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.378
           "And as Buddy
and Bobby Baxter sat down
at the dining room table,

00:45.420 --> 00:47.255
      exhausted and bruised,

00:47.296 --> 00:49.591
      they felt satisfaction.

00:49.631 --> 00:52.218
        The Case of the Boy
in the River had been solved.

00:52.259 --> 00:54.804
     Tomorrow, there would be
another mystery.

00:54.845 --> 00:58.140
           But tonight,
their only concern

00:58.182 --> 00:59.308
           was dinner."

01:02.771 --> 01:04.980
      Outstanding, Mr. Jones.

01:05.022 --> 01:08.317
   I believe the Baxter Brothers
has found their
newest ghostwriter.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.903
     Wait, I won the contract?

01:10.944 --> 01:12.614
     Like, right this second?

01:12.655 --> 01:13.239
         That is correct.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.492
         Professor DuPont,
you can't actually believe

01:16.533 --> 01:18.411
      that garbage was better
than my submission.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.496
        Oh, I can and I do.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.957
     Your contract, Mr. Jones.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.003
       Your first step into
a larger, better life.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.921
  Provided you play by the rules.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.598
        I don't understand.
Dartmouth was my safety school.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.602
       I guess you should've
accepted Harvard's invitation.

01:43.811 --> 01:45.271
         Nice try, Daddy,

01:45.313 --> 01:47.189
          but I still have
my interview with Columbia.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.359
          Interview, huh?

01:50.151 --> 01:51.735
       Good luck with that.

01:51.777 --> 01:54.656
            Columbia's
extremely competitive.

01:54.697 --> 01:58.534
           But, I believe
Riverdale Community College

01:58.575 --> 02:01.120
  has a rolling admission policy.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.290
      So if you study there,
you could launch
your rum empire.

02:05.165 --> 02:06.459
    If that's still happening.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.211
    Oh, it's happening, Daddy.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.716
        Hey, wake up, Red.

02:14.717 --> 02:18.054
          Mr. Jones? Ah!
What are you doing here?

02:18.096 --> 02:20.639
    Investigating a vigilante.

02:20.681 --> 02:23.225
      Now be honest with me.
Is that you?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.812
           Yeah, it is.

02:25.853 --> 02:27.104
          You're not gonna
arrest me, are you?

02:27.146 --> 02:28.230
             I should.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.485
    What the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?

02:32.526 --> 02:33.402
             Helping.

02:33.402 --> 02:36.823
       People are too scared
to call you or the cops,
so I set up a hotline.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.325
   What happens if you get hurt?
Or worse?

02:40.367 --> 02:43.329
     People die changing tires
on the side of
the road, Mr. Jones.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.831
       At least I'd die with
a shred of honor.

02:44.872 --> 02:47.000
       [scoffs] What a load
of smug BS.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.543
      You think that's gonna
comfort your mom?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.336
      Why aren't you focused
on the center,

02:51.378 --> 02:53.381
      -protecting these kids?
-I am.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.841
     But trouble shows up here
about every other day,

02:55.884 --> 02:58.719
   starting with the Dickensons
who are still out there,
by the way.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.722
           You're doing
good work here, Red.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.056
       Here. Honorable work.

03:03.849 --> 03:06.519
       Maybe I can help you.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.353
             [Jughead]
What do you say, Chuck.
Can you help me?

03:08.396 --> 03:10.480
          So you want me
to use FBI resources

03:10.522 --> 03:12.275
       to track down your...

03:12.317 --> 03:14.401
      Sorry, our grandfather.

03:15.235 --> 03:16.153
      Why the sudden urgency?

03:16.153 --> 03:19.449
     Well, look, it's probably
something I should have done
months ago, but...

03:20.490 --> 03:22.117
        I have an important
decision to make.

03:22.159 --> 03:24.287
         And I can't until
I know the truth.
His truth.

03:25.454 --> 03:26.413
         Can you help me?

03:27.289 --> 03:27.789
              What's wrong, Pop?

03:27.789 --> 03:30.293
        Our liquor license
has been revoked.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.712
           As of Sunday,
the speakeasy won't be
allowed to serve alcohol.

03:33.754 --> 03:35.256
     What? According to whom?

03:35.298 --> 03:36.716
        The mayor's office.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.718
             Figures.

03:38.759 --> 03:41.054
          This is payback
for me vowing to challenge

03:41.094 --> 03:42.930
   Daddy's precious rum empire.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.807
             Long-term,
we're fighting this injunction.

03:46.725 --> 03:48.311
            Short-term,

03:50.062 --> 03:52.105
           we're hosting
a no-holds barred blow-out

03:52.147 --> 03:54.317
         at La Bonne Nuit
before the boom falls.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.611
       No offense, Veronica,

03:57.653 --> 04:00.657
          but your father,
he wasn't raised right.

04:02.783 --> 04:04.159
             Actually,

04:04.618 --> 04:06.788
              he was.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.790
     And you've just given me
a great idea.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.002
            [creaking]

04:14.044 --> 04:16.088
      Betty. Betty, wake up.

04:16.129 --> 04:17.632
      What? What's happening?

04:17.673 --> 04:19.259
     Honey, it's your sister.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.009
       She mutilated a nurse
at Shady Grove.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.637
         She almost clawed
her face off.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.641
              [Betty]
Maybe this is a mistake.

04:26.682 --> 04:29.851
        Polly's messed up,
but she's not
a literal monster.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.105
     This is security footage

04:32.146 --> 04:33.189
         from Shady Grove.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.399
           [Betty sighs]

04:38.819 --> 04:42.531
   Okay, Polly is sitting there,
looking like a zombie,
but she's not hurt...

04:49.497 --> 04:51.957
            Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.461
      What the hell happened?
She attacked that nurse
for no reason.

04:55.502 --> 04:57.254
     She'll only talk to you,
she says.

04:58.005 --> 04:58.505
            And alone.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.009
          Okay. Well then
I'll go talk to her.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.343
   First, there's one more thing
you should know.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.178
           The nurse that
Polly disfigured,

05:06.305 --> 05:07.348
        her name is Betty.

05:09.516 --> 05:11.978
                 Heard you
wanted to speak to me.

05:12.019 --> 05:15.814
       Betty. Oh, thank God.

05:15.856 --> 05:19.110
    You're the one I can trust.
Can you tell me
what's going on?

05:19.151 --> 05:20.987
      Polly, can you tell me
what's going on?

05:21.028 --> 05:23.656
           You attacked
a nurse named Betty.

05:23.697 --> 05:24.990
        That's impossible.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.327
          I can't remember
any of what they're saying.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.829
      I was in the rec room,
and the next thing I remember,

05:30.872 --> 05:32.999
            I'm in here
and I'm chained to this bed.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.084
          Please, Betty.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.961
      You have to believe me,
Betty, please.

05:37.502 --> 05:38.713
         I didn't do this.

05:38.754 --> 05:39.547
        Please believe me.

05:39.588 --> 05:43.634
       I didn't do it, Betty.
I didn't do it, it wasn't me.
[crying]

05:43.675 --> 05:45.636
      Please, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this, Betty.

05:45.677 --> 05:46.596
          I didn't do it.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.439
          Damn, Mr. Jones,
where did you get
a metal detector?

05:56.480 --> 05:58.149
        From Southside High
when they shut it down,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.442
         but between that,
and the security cameras
we're hooking up,

06:00.485 --> 06:02.028
          think you're in
pretty good shape, Red.

06:02.069 --> 06:03.946
        Yeah, well, I'll be
in even better shape

06:03.987 --> 06:06.031
     once Dodger and his family
are in jail or out of town.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.533
     But all this is awesome.
Thank you, sir.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.870
           Hey, uh, I can
help you find Dodger.

06:10.911 --> 06:13.247
         I know the alleys,
and a bunch of us
used to work for him.

06:13.288 --> 06:14.081
        We're good, Eddie.

06:14.081 --> 06:18.418
       The last thing I need
is you out there
kicking up dust, okay?

06:18.461 --> 06:20.088
            [Veronica]
Abuelita.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.298
   [Lordes] You've been so busy
mi ahijada.

06:24.091 --> 06:25.884
            -Godmother.
-Mm?

06:25.927 --> 06:29.430
     I've been thinking about
expanding my business,

06:29.471 --> 06:31.723
   getting into rum production.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.225
            But there's
a real craft to it,

06:33.266 --> 06:36.187
           and my father
refuses to teach me.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.399
        -How did he learn?
-From me.

06:39.439 --> 06:41.983
          It is my recipe
that he's using.

06:42.901 --> 06:44.987
         Could you tell me
the recipe?

06:45.028 --> 06:46.988
      [chuckling] Of course!

06:48.824 --> 06:50.409
      But what about college?

06:51.451 --> 06:53.204
        Have you heard back
from Harvard?

06:53.245 --> 06:55.288
                 Abuelita,

06:56.040 --> 06:57.917
      you won't even believe,

06:57.959 --> 07:00.627
     the things that your son
has been doing.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.504
       What kind of things?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.300
         [phone vibrates]

07:07.343 --> 07:08.886
      Hey, Charles, any luck?

07:08.927 --> 07:09.678
                    Yeah.
I found him.

07:09.678 --> 07:11.973
        More specifically,
the U.S. Postal Service did.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.850
       Wait, seriously? How?

07:13.891 --> 07:17.019
      Evidently, Forsythe has
a P.O. box in Seaside.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.187
     He checks it once a month
when he comes in
from the forest.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.106
     Wait, did you say forest?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.608
        The crazy thing is,
I actually believe her.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.360
         Honey, we saw it
with our own eyes.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.779
       Well, no, obviously,
she did it, but...

07:28.488 --> 07:29.197
         not consciously.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.536
         It's like she was
fuguing or something.
Wait a minute.

07:33.577 --> 07:36.788
  The doctors at Shady Grove said
Polly received a phone call

07:36.831 --> 07:39.875
        about an hour or so
before the incident.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.254
          [phone ringing]

07:43.295 --> 07:45.882
         Charles is trying
to figure out
the caller's identity.

07:47.007 --> 07:49.968
     [phone continues ringing]

07:50.011 --> 07:51.596
      Cooper-Jones residence.

07:59.853 --> 08:01.771
               What?
Was it about Polly?

08:13.158 --> 08:14.410
        What are you doing?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.747
        What are you doing?

08:18.079 --> 08:19.540
               Mom.

08:19.581 --> 08:21.292
         Listen to... Mom!

08:21.334 --> 08:24.252
           You're acting
just like Polly.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.672
     You're acting hypnotized.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.548
           [claps hands]

08:33.053 --> 08:34.971
          What's going on?
Why am I holding a knife?

08:36.389 --> 08:38.017
        You don't remember?

08:38.058 --> 08:39.476
          Did somebody...

08:40.561 --> 08:42.230
        Did the phone ring,
or did I imagine it?

08:42.270 --> 08:44.690
            No, it rang,
you answered...

08:44.731 --> 08:47.567
     Whoever called must have
said something that...

08:47.610 --> 08:50.654
    I don't know, triggered you
into attacking me.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.864
      Is that even possible?

08:53.573 --> 08:55.618
          We need Charles
to trace that phone call.

09:01.081 --> 09:02.207
       [footsteps approach]

09:02.250 --> 09:03.793
               Mami.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.961
         What a surprise.
When did you get here?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.089
        [shouts in Spanish]

09:09.090 --> 09:10.841
           You should be
ashamed of yourself.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.970
           Picking fights
with your daughter.

09:14.010 --> 09:16.471
    Your father is turning over
in his grave.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.393
        [footsteps depart]

09:23.770 --> 09:25.063
              Really?

09:25.105 --> 09:27.066
       Turning my own mother
against me.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.277
                Oh.

09:29.317 --> 09:31.903
           And guess what
she shared with me.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.240
  Our family's secret rum recipe.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.159
     So brace yourself, Daddy.

09:38.201 --> 09:39.327
             It's on.

09:42.289 --> 09:44.292
              Archie, I need
for you to sit down for this.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.336
     Vic, your dad's foreman,

09:48.379 --> 09:49.922
       came by earlier today

09:49.963 --> 09:54.092
      and he wants to buy us
out of Andrews Construction.

09:54.134 --> 09:56.428
         Well, tough, Mom,
'cause we're not selling.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.264
          -[phone ringing]
-I'll tell Vic that myself
right after I fire his ass.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.183
         Toby, now is not
a good time.

10:02.225 --> 10:05.687
            It's about Eddie.
He and Malcolm went looking
for Dodger and his brothers.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.940
       -And they found him.
-What? Where are they?

10:07.981 --> 10:10.275
   They're beat up, Archie. Bad.

10:10.317 --> 10:12.611
     Eddie's in the hospital.
Again.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.615
                What'd you
find out, Charles?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.951
            Our hunch was right.

10:18.993 --> 10:22.455
         The calls received
by Polly and Alice
came from the same place.

10:22.495 --> 10:24.749
         Shankshaw Prison.

10:24.789 --> 10:27.751
         Charles, something
must have been said
on those calls

10:27.793 --> 10:30.921
      that made Mom and Polly
enter a trance-like state

10:30.962 --> 10:33.466
         that turned them
into deranged killers.

10:33.506 --> 10:35.134
    As if they were hypnotized.

10:35.176 --> 10:35.926
     I thought the same thing.

10:35.926 --> 10:40.056
         And who do we know
that uses auditory cues
and hypnotism

10:40.096 --> 10:42.557
      to control its members?
The Farm.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.309
        Edgar may be dead,

10:44.351 --> 10:46.895
  but his lovesick lackey Evelyn
sure isn't.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.313
         She's in prison.

10:49.356 --> 10:51.734
      Any chance that prison
is Shankshaw?

11:04.371 --> 11:06.499
         [man] You hold it
right there, boy.

11:06.539 --> 11:08.918
     Now, you are trespassing
on private property.

11:08.958 --> 11:11.294
     If you're Forsythe Jones
the First,

11:11.336 --> 11:12.672
      then I'm your grandson.

11:16.216 --> 11:18.469
     I... I... I... I guess...

11:18.510 --> 11:20.096
    you'd better come in, then.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.104
              Jason,

11:28.937 --> 11:30.022
              Julian,

11:31.273 --> 11:32.899
           thank you for
joining me, brothers.

11:33.817 --> 11:36.696
          [sighs] The day
has finally come.

11:36.736 --> 11:39.698
          I'm ending our
collective misery today.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.201
        The Chernobyl-grade
roach bombs I've set up
throughout Thistlehouse

11:42.243 --> 11:44.412
      are discharging a toxin
strong enough to kill anything

11:44.452 --> 11:46.121
        that crawls within
these walls.

11:48.957 --> 11:50.500
      I was born in poison...

11:53.336 --> 11:54.963
    and I shall die in poison.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.174
           [gas hissing]

12:02.263 --> 12:03.722
            [creaking]

12:03.764 --> 12:05.975
            [coughing]

12:11.147 --> 12:12.355
              Mumzie,

12:13.065 --> 12:14.274
         what a surprise.

12:15.525 --> 12:16.652
           [body thuds]

12:21.240 --> 12:23.200
         Whatever your dad
said about me

12:24.326 --> 12:26.703
         is probably true.

12:26.745 --> 12:29.206
       I'm actually not here
to talk about that.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.499
               Yet.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.421
       I'm here to talk about
one of your old classmates,

12:36.254 --> 12:37.840
          Francis DuPont.

12:37.881 --> 12:40.926
     Well, I remember Francis,
all right.

12:40.967 --> 12:43.846
           Look, I think
you wrote the original
Baxter Brothers book,

12:43.888 --> 12:45.346
            not DuPont.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.390
         I think he stole
your idea

12:47.432 --> 12:49.769
     and then he published it
under his name.

12:49.809 --> 12:51.854
           Oh, you got it
all figured out,
haven't you, boy?

12:53.313 --> 12:55.607
        Except your facts,
little mixed up.

12:58.693 --> 13:00.361
    Well, why don't you help me
sort them out?

13:01.654 --> 13:03.323
         Eddie and Malcolm
are in the hospital.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.951
        Munroe is with them,
they went after
the Dickenson brothers.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.453
          Bill and Fagan
beat the living hell
out of those kids.

13:08.495 --> 13:10.538
          -I'm not gonna
let that go.
-All right.

13:11.581 --> 13:12.707
         All right, then.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.418
           Your dad would
pound the tar out of me

13:15.461 --> 13:17.212
       if I let you do this
on your own,
but this is it.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.087
          We handle these
Dickenson boys

13:18.129 --> 13:22.051
      and then you're putting
this vigilante business
to bed, all of it.

13:22.091 --> 13:25.095
            If I agree,
will you help me?

13:25.846 --> 13:27.014
               Yeah.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.350
            Just let me
get changed first.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.273
       [indistinct chatter]

13:42.196 --> 13:43.572
        Well, lookie here.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.282
     Bill and Fagan Dickenson.

13:45.323 --> 13:48.536
           You guys are
the scum of the earth.
Going after kids.

13:49.327 --> 13:50.495
              [spits]

13:54.875 --> 13:56.751
        [FP] Big man, huh?

13:56.793 --> 13:58.546
       Beating up teenagers.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.091
       Let's see how you do
against someone
your own size.

14:04.717 --> 14:05.885
      I'll break your bones,
old man.

14:05.927 --> 14:06.928
    Not before we break yours.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.764
             [grunts]

14:12.142 --> 14:13.769
                  Time to
rise and shine, mother dear.

14:13.811 --> 14:14.979
             [coughs]

14:20.192 --> 14:23.153
          Cheryl. What...

14:23.195 --> 14:26.573
       Did you really think
I was gassing myself
to an early grave?

14:26.615 --> 14:29.201
       No. That was a ruse.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.911
    But riddle me this, Mumzie.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.248
          Do you remember
when I was a little girl,

14:34.289 --> 14:36.875
      and you used to read me
Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland?

14:36.917 --> 14:39.378
      Cheryl, you release me
this minute!

14:39.419 --> 14:41.462
          You would ask me
if I thought I was Alice.

14:41.504 --> 14:45.216
          And I would say,
"No, Mother,
I'm the Red Queen."

14:47.302 --> 14:49.013
        So as the Red Queen
did to Alice,

14:49.053 --> 14:51.056
         I am putting you
on trial.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.975
          Lunatic child.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.644
       What are the charges?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.563
       They are as follows.

14:58.605 --> 15:01.734
       Prolonged gaslighting
in hopes of driving me
cuckoo-bananas,

15:01.774 --> 15:05.571
    attempted murder of Archie,
Betty, Veronica and Jughead,

15:05.613 --> 15:08.072
         and actual murder
of my father,

15:08.115 --> 15:10.909
         Clifford Blossom,
Claudius Blossom,

15:10.951 --> 15:12.745
          and Hal Cooper
among others.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.498
         How do you plead,
mother most foul?

15:19.751 --> 15:21.294
           I gotta say,

15:23.129 --> 15:24.423
          that felt good.

15:25.173 --> 15:26.549
               Yeah?

15:26.591 --> 15:28.594
    -We kicked ass, Mr. Jones.
-Mm-hmm.

15:30.638 --> 15:34.475
         It's been a while
since these fists delivered
some proper street justice.

15:35.975 --> 15:38.437
          The old jacket
still fits like a glove.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.605
            -[chuckles]
-And your old man,

15:40.648 --> 15:43.859
     he's looking down on us,
probably shaking
his head, but...

15:45.818 --> 15:47.196
             still...

15:50.282 --> 15:52.909
         he'd be glad your
crime-fighting days are over.

15:55.870 --> 15:58.039
      [Forsythe] And I always
loved detective stories,

15:58.081 --> 16:01.125
         so, uh, I come up
with this notion

16:01.168 --> 16:03.921
          to write a book
about teenage detectives.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.297
    Right, the Baxter Brothers.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.631
             So how did
DuPont steal it from you?

16:06.673 --> 16:09.134
      [scoffs] You're getting
ahead of the story here.

16:09.176 --> 16:12.471
    You see, I was burning out
at Stonewall,

16:12.513 --> 16:14.472
          so, uh, I quit.

16:15.849 --> 16:19.269
       The only thing I had
to show for it all is this

16:19.311 --> 16:22.355
    one Baxter Brothers story.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.359
           I didn't know
what to do with it.
Francis said he did.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.860
           He offered to
buy it from me.

16:26.902 --> 16:27.778
             How much?

16:28.778 --> 16:29.989
              $5,000.

16:30.029 --> 16:31.615
              $5,000?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.616
      That franchise is worth
millions now.

16:33.658 --> 16:37.120
          Over the years,
When I saw how popular
Baxter Brothers became,

16:37.162 --> 16:39.081
          I grew bitter,

16:39.123 --> 16:42.750
          started drinking
and took my anger out
on the world,

16:43.961 --> 16:45.837
          and on my son.

16:45.879 --> 16:49.341
       Eventually I figured
it'd be best for all concerned
if I just--

16:49.383 --> 16:51.342
            Went out for
a pack of cigarettes
and didn't come back?

16:51.384 --> 16:52.427
               Yeah.

16:54.554 --> 16:56.306
             [scoffs]

16:56.347 --> 16:58.558
        Mr. DuPont asked me
to be the next ghostwriter.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.768
          Is that a fact?

17:01.019 --> 17:02.354
        All this time, I...

17:04.815 --> 17:07.192
   I had thought that Mr. DuPont
was killing people

17:07.233 --> 17:09.528
         in order to keep
the secret that he stole
the book from you.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.865
      [chuckles] That's quite
the theory there.

17:12.905 --> 17:15.867
       If that was the case,
he would have killed me too,
wouldn't he?

17:16.242 --> 17:18.619
            Yeah. Yes.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.413
     A word of advice for you.

17:21.664 --> 17:24.000
       I messed up my life.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.961
            I messed up
your father's life.

17:27.378 --> 17:31.340
    You seize the opportunities
you're being given.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.887
       -[prison door buzzes]
-Took you long enough.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.016
          You weaponized
my family against me

17:39.057 --> 17:43.686
  by calling them and triggering
some post-hypnotic suggestion.

17:44.771 --> 17:46.731
       What's the directive?

17:46.773 --> 17:49.942
    How exactly are you getting
your sleeper cells to turn?

17:49.984 --> 17:53.238
  When I deliver the activation,
the receiver turns

17:53.279 --> 17:54.323
             into you.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.782
           What the hell
does that mean?

17:55.824 --> 17:58.076
        They become Betty.

17:58.117 --> 18:00.662
       As in, Betty Cooper,

18:00.703 --> 18:01.829
              as in,

18:01.872 --> 18:02.413
               you.

18:02.455 --> 18:05.250
       Why did Polly attack
a nurse named Betty?

18:05.291 --> 18:06.751
          Why did my mom
come after me?

18:06.794 --> 18:08.836
          When triggered,
they become Betty.

18:08.878 --> 18:10.756
         They try to kill
dark Betty,

18:10.798 --> 18:13.842
            evil Betty,
other Betty.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.845
             You mean
they try to murder me.

18:16.886 --> 18:18.596
        Elegant, isn't it?

18:21.016 --> 18:22.601
       It was Edgar's idea.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.604

the trigger word,

18:26.896 --> 18:28.773
          And therefore,
try to kill you.

          For what? Hey.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.923
    It'll take a whole lot more
than a flesh wound

19:34.964 --> 19:37.009
         for me to regret
what we did tonight.

19:37.049 --> 19:38.676
     It was Dodger Dickenson.

19:40.804 --> 19:44.223

it was Dodger
and his crazy-ass mom Darla.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.934
      That was a parting shot
before the Dickensons
get out of town.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.144
         So they're still
in Riverdale?

19:48.186 --> 19:49.479
         Yep. Loading out
the arcade.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.355
        How about you keep
your damn mouth shut, Fangs?

19:51.397 --> 19:53.775
          You're already
on thin ice with me.
And you,

19:53.817 --> 19:56.403
           you don't even
think about it, Red.
We talked about this.

19:56.444 --> 19:59.198
           You agreed to
hang it up for good. Hey!

19:59.239 --> 20:01.365
   They're leaving town. Archie!

20:05.119 --> 20:07.455
      I left before she could
say it a third time.

20:07.497 --> 20:11.042
  But what the hell would happen
if I heard the trigger word
three times?

20:11.084 --> 20:13.921
       Would I be activated
and wanna kill myself?

20:13.961 --> 20:15.631

20:32.940 --> 20:34.191
         Nothing happened.

20:35.358 --> 20:38.237
           Maybe because
you're already Betty?

20:38.278 --> 20:41.656
      Well, the good news is,
you're officially not
a ticking time bomb.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.327
                    Why must we
endure this farce?

20:46.369 --> 20:48.204
       It's clear no matter
what I say,

20:48.247 --> 20:50.289
      you're just looking for
a reason to kill me, Cheryl.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.000
     On the contrary, Mumzie,

20:54.461 --> 20:56.922
           despite your
wicked machinations,

20:56.963 --> 20:59.090
          I'm looking for
a reason to spare

20:59.465 --> 21:00.509
            your life.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.678
         You're my mother.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.888
      And yet, you've always
been so cruel to me...

21:08.099 --> 21:09.142
             For why?

21:11.853 --> 21:14.815
         You brutalized me
my entire life.

21:14.855 --> 21:17.025
   You tried to kill my friends,

21:17.067 --> 21:19.403
              and then
you hid in Thistlehouse
to keep torturing me.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.115
    You saw me happy with Toni
and you couldn't
let that be, could you?

21:24.156 --> 21:25.409
             [laughs]

21:27.160 --> 21:29.621
     It wasn't your happiness
with the she-goblin

21:29.663 --> 21:31.914
     that I wanted to destroy.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.875
       It was your happiness
with Jason.

21:34.917 --> 21:37.962
      How can I live knowing
that you are happy

21:38.005 --> 21:40.632

21:40.673 --> 21:44.219
           You don't get
what I can't have!

21:44.260 --> 21:46.846
       In that case, Mumzie,

21:46.887 --> 21:49.724
          you're guilty of
the worst crime of all:

21:50.892 --> 21:53.894
          being hateful to
your rotten core.

21:53.936 --> 21:57.316
          Hmm. So, there.
You've condemned me.

21:58.357 --> 21:59.358
              [sighs]

21:59.401 --> 22:00.693
         Execute me, then.

22:02.028 --> 22:03.571
     Or cart me off to prison.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.324
              Oh no.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.743

in the traditional sense.

   What are you doing here? I...
My interview's on Monday.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.473
          Your assistant
called my assistant,

23:12.516 --> 23:14.226
  and requested that I come down

23:14.267 --> 23:17.229
  and see your thriving business
in action tonight.

23:22.275 --> 23:25.862
  I'm so sorry, Miss Rutherford,
for the miscommunication,

23:25.903 --> 23:28.865
  but can we talk in a bit? Um...

23:28.906 --> 23:30.826
       I promised the crowd
a floor show.

about the way
he treated you.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.317
    Doc has me here overnight.

29:39.402 --> 29:40.819
           I guess if he
wanted to stop by,

29:40.862 --> 29:42.654
         couldn't exactly
say no...

29:44.490 --> 29:45.741
             could I?

29:50.329 --> 29:51.372
                Oh.

29:56.419 --> 29:57.628
          Hello, Mumzie.

29:57.670 --> 29:58.880
              Cheryl?

30:01.132 --> 30:03.175
           What is this?

30:03.218 --> 30:04.134
        I trust you approve
of this bunker.

30:04.176 --> 30:08.181
    After all, it's larger than
the cell you would have
gotten at Shankshaw.

30:08.222 --> 30:11.017
            With food,
electricity, plumbing.

30:11.058 --> 30:12.810
        You wretched child.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.645
     You can't keep me... Oh.

30:14.686 --> 30:16.355
     On the contrary, Mother,

30:17.898 --> 30:19.526
    you need time and solitude

30:19.567 --> 30:21.778
          to seek penance
for your crimes and cruelty.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.488
             Toodles.

30:23.529 --> 30:25.155
          Cheryl. Cheryl.

30:26.156 --> 30:27.407
              Chery!

30:33.580 --> 30:36.250
    [Betty] It was terrifying,
Charles.

30:36.291 --> 30:40.171
     When I saw the red door,
I fugued.

30:40.212 --> 30:44.049
          I slipped into
a trance. Why?

30:44.092 --> 30:46.510
           I don't know,
maybe a combination
of hearing the trigger earlier

30:46.552 --> 30:48.429
       and then returning to
a familiar setting.

30:49.388 --> 30:50.765
            What I saw,

30:52.057 --> 30:54.685
     me about to kill Caramel,

30:56.563 --> 30:59.606
        I think that's when
the dark part of me
was born.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.025
          If that's true,

31:01.067 --> 31:03.862
         if you can go back
to the moment
of dark Betty's birth

31:03.903 --> 31:05.571
    and stop it from happening,

31:06.405 --> 31:07.030
     it will essentially be...

31:07.030 --> 31:10.451
       Killing my shadow self
before she was even born.

31:11.618 --> 31:12.828
         We could try it.

31:15.832 --> 31:16.833
               Yeah.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.502
              [sighs]

31:20.545 --> 31:21.796
            Tangerine.

31:21.837 --> 31:24.214
       Tangerine. Tangerine.

31:59.625 --> 32:00.667
               Wait.

32:01.877 --> 32:04.005
         Let me take that
from you.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.340
           But what am I
gonna do now?

32:06.798 --> 32:08.134
         You can go play.

32:08.175 --> 32:10.470
              Really?
I can go and play?

32:12.137 --> 32:13.431
          Yeah, go ahead.

32:14.348 --> 32:15.516
            Thank you.

32:29.655 --> 32:30.781
         [Charles] Betty.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.077
             I... I...

32:35.118 --> 32:37.038
           I'm not sure,
but I think I did it.

32:37.704 --> 32:39.332
     Well, that's great news.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.833
         You're all right.

32:41.667 --> 32:42.250
         You're okay now.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.839
        I'm sorry I kept you
waiting, Miss Rutherford.

32:49.842 --> 32:52.971
            I'm guessing
my shot at Columbia
is pretty much blown.

32:54.221 --> 32:55.973
         Not necessarily.

32:56.015 --> 33:00.644
            At Columbia,
we're always looking for
people with good stories.

33:00.686 --> 33:03.564
            I don't know
what happened here tonight,

33:03.605 --> 33:05.232
  but I'll bet it's a good story.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.069
           It is indeed.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.071
          Well, how about
you tell it to me?

33:12.073 --> 33:13.365
             [inhales]

33:25.711 --> 33:27.171
    [Toni] Babe, are you okay?

33:27.212 --> 33:29.382
           Are you having
second thoughts
about your mom?

33:30.465 --> 33:32.509
            No, but...

33:34.971 --> 33:37.557
         I was ruminating
that perhaps...

33:38.766 --> 33:39.851
              [sighs]

33:41.853 --> 33:43.354
     it's time to bury Jason.

33:46.732 --> 33:48.317
       Cheryl, are you sure?

33:56.366 --> 33:57.617
               Yes.

33:58.702 --> 33:59.746
              [sighs]

34:01.079 --> 34:03.040
     There's been so much pain

34:03.082 --> 34:05.751
     and poison in this house.

34:05.792 --> 34:09.547
            And Jason,
more than any of us,

34:11.632 --> 34:14.802
         deserves the peace
my mother spent years
denying me.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.554
                 Archie?

34:17.597 --> 34:19.222
      What's going on, honey?

34:19.264 --> 34:20.807
            Why are you
sitting in the dark?

34:24.811 --> 34:26.313
          What happened?

34:27.106 --> 34:28.648
       Who did this to you?

34:30.150 --> 34:31.193
              I did.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.572
       I did it to me, Mom.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.409
          The Dickensons
were leaving town.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.077
           They were done
with Riverdale.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.371
    But I wanted to hurt them,
to hurt Dodger.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.918
       Maybe even kill him.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.126
              Archie.

34:49.378 --> 34:51.588
            Doesn't make
any sense to me, Mom,

34:51.630 --> 34:54.425
     how predators like Dodger
get to live,

34:56.802 --> 34:58.554
          but Dad, he...

35:02.516 --> 35:04.559
              [sighs]

35:04.601 --> 35:07.396
  And the worst part about it is,
some of the kids
from the center were there,

35:07.438 --> 35:09.940
          and they saw me
standing over him, angry,

35:11.442 --> 35:12.485
              bloody,

35:13.820 --> 35:15.947
          -and a monster.
-No.

35:15.987 --> 35:17.572
       You're not a monster.

35:18.532 --> 35:19.617
          You're just...

35:20.367 --> 35:21.536
          still hurting.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.789
     When will this end, Mom?

35:28.543 --> 35:30.128
        How does this end?

35:32.463 --> 35:35.048
      I've never felt further
from Dad than I do now.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.054
           [Mary sighs]

35:54.860 --> 35:57.237
     Let me guess, my old man
didn't wanna come.

35:58.530 --> 35:59.532
                No.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.199
           He ran away.

36:03.952 --> 36:05.413
           I'm so sorry.

36:09.791 --> 36:11.168
        I feel like a fool.

36:11.751 --> 36:13.295
          No, you're not.

36:15.255 --> 36:17.757
           You would be
if you turned down
that contract, though.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.596
        No, I'm signing it.

36:24.556 --> 36:25.932
              [sighs]

36:28.686 --> 36:30.563
         I think it's time
to let go of the past.

37:05.972 --> 37:07.432
        Evening, Forsythe.

37:16.733 --> 37:17.818
                Oh.

37:18.777 --> 37:20.153
         This is the part
where you kill me?

37:21.447 --> 37:23.199
           No, you ass.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.454
        It's an initiation.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.414
            Welcome to
the Quill and Skull Society,
Jones.

38:12.789 --> 38:14.666
           [all applaud]

38:16.626 --> 38:18.128
         [phone vibrating]

38:23.717 --> 38:24.885
        Cheryl, what's up?

38:30.016 --> 38:31.641
      [Cheryl] Thank you all
for coming.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.978
         You all were here
last time I was
at this river.

38:34.936 --> 38:36.813
           When I tried
to take my own life.

38:38.940 --> 38:40.400
         It's only fitting

38:40.443 --> 38:41.902
       that you're here now.

38:42.902 --> 38:44.655
   [tearfully] My beloved Toni,

38:44.697 --> 38:46.532
         as I give Jason,

38:47.657 --> 38:48.992
           at long last,

38:50.411 --> 38:52.246
     the funeral he deserves.

39:02.505 --> 39:03.673
             [crying]

39:20.106 --> 39:21.567
        [continues crying]

39:45.215 --> 39:47.300
   He was a good brother to me.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.972
       I wish you could have
met him for real.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.101
              I know.

39:56.893 --> 39:58.521
        [door beeps, opens]

40:01.856 --> 40:03.150
           [door closes]

40:12.784 --> 40:14.244
          [Archie] Yeah?

40:14.286 --> 40:15.704
          Can I help you?

40:15.746 --> 40:17.789
              Archie?
Archie Andrews?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.418
               I am.

40:20.458 --> 40:21.668
    It's good to see you, son.

40:22.753 --> 40:23.838
         My name is Frank.

40:25.213 --> 40:26.340
            I'm, uh...

40:27.675 --> 40:29.135
      I'm your dad's brother.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.371
            Tangerine.

41:00.039 --> 41:01.500
            Tangerine.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.376
         [glass shatters]

41:03.918 --> 41:04.878
              Betty.

41:05.753 --> 41:06.797
              Honey.

41:06.838 --> 41:08.215
          What happened?

41:11.844 --> 41:13.846
       I wanted to make sure
that it was gone.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.849
     The dark part of myself.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.268
            And it was.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.833
            He's dead.

41:45.210 --> 41:46.253
      What did you do, Betty?
