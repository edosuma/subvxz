00:05.606 --> 00:07.708
[Payson] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.741 --> 00:10.211
[Damon] This next song "Finally
Free" was written with a friend
of mine.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.680
I'm hoping she's
going to sing it with me.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.049
[Kaylie crying] She was lying
to everyone...

00:15.083 --> 00:18.219
...even to herself...
and so am I.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.221
And I don't want to die.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.290
[Darby] Dallas cancelled.
The good news...

00:22.323 --> 00:25.526
...I pulled some strings
and found another club.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.162
Pinewood? They're one of the
worst ranked teams in the
country.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.730
The Hungary Invitational
is in 2 weeks,

00:29.763 --> 00:31.665
and we need to see
how our routines hold up

00:31.699 --> 00:33.401
in serious competition.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.335
[groans]

00:34.368 --> 00:36.804
We need a coach, a real coach.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.615
Mom? I still need to pack.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.483
I'm just checking these
boarding passes...

00:49.517 --> 00:51.619
Denver, London,
London, Budapest...

00:51.652 --> 00:52.586
Sasha's in Romania?

00:52.620 --> 00:54.054
Ah, yes.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.157
We're sending him some papers.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.658
Well, Is he coming back?

00:57.691 --> 00:59.260
Release papers.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.729
His contract is through World
and we need him to sign those

01:01.762 --> 01:04.031
before we can validate
Darby's contract.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.434
So we could still
get rid of her?

01:06.467 --> 01:07.601
[Kim] Payson.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.138
We lost to the worst
club team in the country.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.674
Darby's a nice girl but she's
just not the coach we need.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.076
Unfortunately she's the
coach we have.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.346
Get the lights, would ya'?

01:24.552 --> 01:27.721
Everyone is going to be
watching you in Hungary

01:27.755 --> 01:31.159
and if it looks like
you can't control our girls,

01:31.192 --> 01:33.627
the NGO will take action.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.763
I know how it works.
I'm not a child.

01:35.796 --> 01:39.533
Well then stop acting like one
and start acting like a coach.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.536
You're not here to win
a popularity contest.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.639
And you're not the only one
they'll be judging.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.442
After the Pinewood debacle,
my sources tell me

01:48.476 --> 01:50.611
they are seriously questioning
whether The Rock girls

01:50.644 --> 01:52.646
really belong on the World Team.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.681
Is that true?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.190
You're damn right it's true.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.758
I asked you girls to take the
Pinewood meet seriously

02:04.792 --> 02:06.394
but you didn't
listen to me.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.763
So from now on,
I'm not asking. I'm telling.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.333
I will see you at
the airport at 10 a.m.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.702
And if any one of you is late,
you'll all have hell to pay.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.170
Got it?

02:23.877 --> 02:26.547
[Chloe] Emily!
Hurry up, we have to go!

02:26.580 --> 02:28.316
Coming.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.722
What are you doing here?

02:34.755 --> 02:36.390
What if someone from
the NGO is watching?

02:36.424 --> 02:37.891
So, why haven't you
returned any of my calls?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.660
We're on our way to the airport.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.730
Five minutes, Mrs. Kmetko,
please? Just give us five
minutes.

02:42.763 --> 02:47.835
Fine, five minutes,
and then I'm honking the horn.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.770
Talk to me, Emily.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.206
Are you shutting me out because
you're nervous about the Meet?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.407
Or is something else
happening here?

02:53.441 --> 02:55.175
What's going on between
you and Kaylie?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.810
And don't say nothing.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.712
But nothing is going on.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.714
I mean Kaylie's going through
a tough time.

03:00.748 --> 03:01.815
She needed a friend.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.585
I'm her friend.
She could have come to me.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.753
Emily.

03:05.786 --> 03:06.654
Is she your muse now?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.323
What? We had sex,
you got what you wanted

03:09.357 --> 03:10.724
and now you're on to
the next girl in crisis?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.593
Emily, stop it.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.863
I love... you.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.731
I love you,
you gotta trust me.

03:19.433 --> 03:24.705
I can't trust you.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.307
So, what are you saying?

03:29.377 --> 03:32.780
I can't have you
messing with my head.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.815
We're done.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.885
For real.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.465
Now, remember,

03:53.334 --> 03:55.669
it's for emergency uses only.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.970
Thanks, Daddy.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.639
Do you think that's wise?

03:58.672 --> 04:02.310
Giving her a credit card with a
twenty thousand dollar limit?

04:03.644 --> 04:05.979
Where's Emily?

04:06.013 --> 04:08.749
Woo-hoo! Here we are!

04:08.782 --> 04:10.718
Sorry. Traffic.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.255
OK. Bye-bye.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.659
Now that you're all here,

04:18.692 --> 04:20.728
let me tell you things
are going to change.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.497
I tried being your friend, tried
respecting you as professionals,

04:23.531 --> 04:25.499
- Oh, Darbs...
- It's Coach Conrad.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.971
I am no longer your friend,
I am your coach.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.808
From now I will be watching your
every move and you will do as I
say.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.777
Is that clear?

04:39.046 --> 04:43.717
[Emily] I don't know how much
more I can take of Coach Conrad.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.719
You won't have to much longer.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.016
I know I have a problem.

05:19.887 --> 05:24.392
And I know if I don't
do something, I'll die.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.661
And I don't want to die.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.830
[Gene] Good.

05:29.863 --> 05:33.333
That was an honest expression
of your feelings, Kaylie.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.369
I'm getting there.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.606
And, I've been writing
everything down like you
suggested.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.978
So, Let me ask you this.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.047
Why do you think you
stopped eating?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.849
To beat Genji Cho.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.084
Is that the only reason?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.424
What other reason
could there be?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.459
You tell me.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.696
[Gene] I want you to ask
yourself this week...

06:02.730 --> 06:06.600
..."When did I stop eating?
And, why?"

06:06.634 --> 06:09.737
And whatever pops into your
head...

06:09.770 --> 06:13.340
...a word, a phrase, an image...

06:13.373 --> 06:14.608
just put it down.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.593
Hey.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.663
You okay?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.065
I'm great.

06:38.098 --> 06:42.402
Everything is just
perfect with me.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.738
What are you
busy working on?

06:48.709 --> 06:51.745
I'm going to get Sasha
and bring him back to The Rock.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.582
You don't even know
where he lives.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.149
Wrong, masked stranger.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.487
He's in Snagov, Romania;
just outside of Bucharest.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.458
Unfortunately, we're going to
Budapest. Hungary.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.026
With a layover at Heathrow.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.495
Check this out.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.098
A flight from London
to Bucharest.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.535
It leaves fifteen minutes before
our connecting flight to
Budapest.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.737
I am going to be on that flight.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.773
Right. Not without a ticket.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.743
Oh, hey, do you know somebody
with a gold card that I could
use?

07:22.776 --> 07:23.911
As if.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.748
Look. We're in trouble.
All of us.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.551
We just got our asses
handed to us by Pinewood.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.952
Pinewood.

07:31.985 --> 07:35.155
The NGO is using this meet to
take another look at us three.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.626
And without Sasha,

07:38.659 --> 07:40.961
there is a definite chance that
none of us are going to Worlds.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.130
Where on earth did you
get that idea?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.998
Your dad.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.100
That's what he told Darby.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.670
Well, he didn't tell me.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.573
Look, Payson, I know you're
lovesick over your boyfriend,

07:52.606 --> 07:53.774
but this is crazy.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.143
No, it's not.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.046
Sasha is the only person
left that believes in me.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.781
I need him and
I want to go too.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.882
- Forget it.
- No way.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.950
Why not?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.953
Because you're already in big
trouble with the NGO.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.589
And I'll be in a lot more
trouble if we don't

08:08.622 --> 08:11.191
get Sasha back and
I don't go to Worlds.

08:14.027 --> 08:19.967
[sighing] Okay. Because you two
will screw this up without me...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.135
- ...three tickets.
- Yes!

08:26.506 --> 08:28.909
How are we going to get away
from Summer and Darby?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.912
Oh, I'm sure we can
figure something out.

08:35.082 --> 08:40.954
Okay, Bucharest, Concourse B,
Gate 17. It's now boarding.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.626
Where is Lauren?
[sighs]

08:45.659 --> 08:47.961
Hey, did you get the tickets?

08:47.995 --> 08:51.565
Yes and they cost a bloody
fortune. I am so dead.

08:51.599 --> 08:55.502
[man over P.A.]
Will Summer Van Horn please
come to the white courtesy
phone.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.739
Will Summer Van Horn please
come to the white courtesy
phone.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.173
One down...

09:00.207 --> 09:01.308
One to ditch.

09:04.845 --> 09:09.082
Excuse me, Coach Conrad, we're
going to use the restroom, okay?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.585
Okay, but hurry. Our flight
should be boarding soon.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.854
We will.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.891
You know, wait. I need to go
too. I'll go with you guys.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.259
[sighing]

09:49.089 --> 09:50.791
We have five minutes
till they close the gate.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.759
Where is Concourse B?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.326
It's up a level.
Come on, this way.

09:57.965 --> 10:01.001
Well, if it isn't Emily Kmetko
and her chain gang.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.069
[Payson] Kelly Parker.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.336
What are you doing here?

10:03.370 --> 10:06.306
The NGO called me while I was in
Houston doing rehab on my ankle.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.042
[Kelly] They asked me to come to
Budapest as a replacement.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.277
So, surprise!

10:10.310 --> 10:12.112
You didn't even qualify
for the World Team.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.649
Yeah, I guess they're having
doubts about Kaylie coming
back from her injury.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.851
If anyone's really buying that.

10:17.885 --> 10:21.655
Isn't the gate for Budapest
down on Concourse A?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.227
Have you seen the girls?

10:27.260 --> 10:29.129
No. I was answering a page.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.665
At least I thought I was.
No one was there.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.000
Why? Aren't they with you?

10:33.033 --> 10:36.369
Well, they were. I mean,
I thought they were.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.339
Well, if they're not with
you, then where are they?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.841
I know where they are.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.343
Yeah, I just saw them.
They were headed to Concourse B.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.079
And they were in a big hurry.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.859
No turning back now.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.404
I am so sorry, Kim.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.373
I'm taking the next flight to
Romania.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.375
I'll find the girls.
I promise.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.678
Try not to worry.
Okay.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.148
You know what? They are doing
this to make me look bad.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.183
[raising voice] And that is
exactly what I'm going to tell
the NGO!

11:23.216 --> 11:26.820
Darby. Shut up. You are
not telling the NGO anything,

11:26.854 --> 11:28.956
except that the girls
missed their flight

11:28.989 --> 11:31.124
but will be in Budapest in time
for registration tonight.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.259
Do you understand?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.828
[stammering] Right.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.229
Okay.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.932
But if they're not there I am
not taking the fall for this.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.200
They'll be there.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.770
[indistinguishable PA
announcement]

11:42.803 --> 11:45.305
They have to be there.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.341
How much trouble do you
think we're in?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.043
On a scale of one to ten?
[clearing throat]

11:50.077 --> 11:51.111
Five thousand.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.349
Okay, here's the plan.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.219
We land in Bucharest at 10 a.m.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.188
And it takes one hour to get
from the airport to Snagov

12:01.221 --> 12:02.455
where Sasha lives.

12:02.489 --> 12:06.426
The last train from Snagov to
Budapest leaves at 4 p.m.,

12:06.459 --> 12:08.695
which means, once we find Sasha

12:08.728 --> 12:10.764
we've only got two hours to
convince him to come back to The
Rock.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.000
Well that makes me
feel much better.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.202
What is that?

12:15.235 --> 12:19.973
An energy drink. I think.
I can't read the label.
[chuckles]

12:20.007 --> 12:21.341
Are you crazy?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.343
Do you have any idea
how many energy drinks

12:23.376 --> 12:25.078
have banned substances in them.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.981
I mean, what if something
illegal comes up in your urine
test after the meet?

12:28.015 --> 12:30.383
I wasn't thinking.
I only had a few sips.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.352
You haven't been
thinking at all lately.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.255
You're totally unfocused
because you can't stop thinking
about Damon.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.224
[Emily sighing]

12:37.257 --> 12:40.327
Well, I guess I'm going to have
to... because we broke up.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.462
What?

12:42.495 --> 12:45.866
We broke up.
For real. For good.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.835
I'm sorry, Emily.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.402
Look at the bright side.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.504
[sighing] At least you never
slept with him.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.377
Oh my god! You did.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.979
You finally slept with him?

12:59.012 --> 13:00.347
Are you okay?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.816
I don't know.
But I broke up with him.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.384
Why?

13:04.417 --> 13:07.087
Because I think there's
something going on between him
and Kaylie.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.488
No way.

13:08.521 --> 13:12.092
I know Kaylie. And one thing
she'd never, ever do,

13:12.125 --> 13:13.360
is steal your boyfriend.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.794
She's right.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.465
Do you think I made
a terrible mistake?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.109
Oh, hey.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.912
I didn't know you were going to
come so early. I was just hiding
from my mom.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.146
I'll get out of your hair.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.814
Oh, It's okay.
You can stay.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.549
Is everything okay?

13:36.583 --> 13:39.786
[sighing]
Emily broke up with me.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.255
What?

13:42.289 --> 13:46.994
And she thinks that I'm in the
way of everything that she wants
in life.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.829
You know, it's like,
one minute she needs me

13:49.863 --> 13:51.431
and then the next,
I'm the problem.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.201
Or at least she tries to
make me the problem.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.803
She tried to suggest there was
something between you and me

13:56.836 --> 13:58.338
because we sang together.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.373
[stammering] Sorry.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.375
No. I mean it's in her head.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.312
Is gymnastics really
that intense?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.180
That you can't trust anyone
but yourself?

14:07.214 --> 14:10.583
[inhaling sharply]
Gymnastics is dangerous.

14:10.617 --> 14:15.188
For some people, any distraction
at all can have serious
consequences.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.990
And I get that.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.192
Even without gymnastics,

14:19.226 --> 14:22.195
would she still find
some reason to push me away?

14:22.229 --> 14:24.331
Is that just who she is?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.333
Is that just her issue?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.069
Maybe it's not the sport at all.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.908
I don't know.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.877
But I know that you love Emily.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.412
Are you willing to give that up?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.019
I think I will
come back later.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.647
Are you sure this is
the right address?

15:14.681 --> 15:17.650
Maybe I transposed a number.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.157
Oh, hi, excuse me,
do you speak English?

15:24.191 --> 15:26.159
What? You're not fluent
in Romanian?

15:26.193 --> 15:29.262
Does Sasha Belov live here?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.098
No.
No Sasha Belov.

15:31.131 --> 15:35.335
Maybe he's staying with somebody
else. He's tall, got the blond
hair.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.603
And oh so handsome.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.604
[woman] No live here.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.439
I know everyone lives here.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.408
I'm sorry.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.245
[exhaling sharply]
Well, that's just great.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.249
We risked suspension and
expulsion for a wild goose chase

15:49.282 --> 15:52.152
through the
Romanian countryside.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.687
[Lauren exclaiming]
Nice going Payson!

15:57.524 --> 16:00.060
So, what do we do now?

16:08.101 --> 16:10.137
[Lauren exhaling sharply]

16:10.170 --> 16:13.573
Looks like a couple of hours
until the next train to Budapest
leaves.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.042
I can't believe this.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.177
You can't believe this?

16:17.210 --> 16:21.448
I just wasted over a thousand
dollars of my dad's money.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.616
How many different kinds of
borscht can there be?

16:23.650 --> 16:27.287
[Sasha] That depends. Do you
like it with or without meat?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.122
[all] Sasha?

16:29.156 --> 16:30.190
What are you doing here?

16:30.223 --> 16:32.159
I work here.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.726
The better question is,
what are you doing here?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.163
You're supposed to be in
Budapest at the East Euro Meet.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.032
We took a detour. To come
get you and bring you home.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.568
We need you, Sasha.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.137
And, you're in breach
of your contract.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.139
Payson, your mother called me.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.641
You ditched your coach, you've
worried your families,

16:48.675 --> 16:50.677
And now, before you let
your teammates down,

16:50.710 --> 16:53.080
you're getting your asses back
to Hungary ASAP.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.547
We're not leaving
here without you.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.516
Then you're going to
be here a very long time

16:56.549 --> 16:57.650
because I'm not coming back.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.334
Well, this was a great plan.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.636
Any more brilliant ideas?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.005
He's testing us;
we just have to wait him out.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.707
Till when?
Till he says 'no' again?

17:26.513 --> 17:27.680
So, what's it like
being a bartender?

17:27.714 --> 17:31.151
What's it like
losing to Pinewood?

17:32.352 --> 17:35.188
He knows we lost to Pinewood!

17:35.222 --> 17:36.189
So?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.557
So, he's following
our gymnastics.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.692
Why would he do that
if he wasn't coming back?

17:39.726 --> 17:43.496
Why would he want to come
back after we lost to Pinewood?

17:45.232 --> 17:47.467
Let me try to talk to him.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.378
Remember when you had me fall
backwards off the beam and you
caught me?

17:58.411 --> 18:01.481
A trust exercise. Yeah.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.416
You said I could trust you.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.653
You promised me that
you'd never leave.

18:06.686 --> 18:10.223
I'm sorry, Emily. I don't have
the answers you're looking for.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.591
You're better off finding
a coach who does.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.726
Well, what if there isn't one?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.262
What if I'm not good enough?

18:15.295 --> 18:19.566
With or without me,
only you can answer that.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.701
[Chloe] What's going to happen?

18:21.734 --> 18:24.371
Emily's already on thin ice.
And this could really crack it.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.573
Don't worry.
She won't be singled out.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.709
He's right. The girls
are in this together.

18:29.742 --> 18:33.680
Yeah, but Emily was the only
one forced to sign the Code
of Conduct with the NGO.

18:33.713 --> 18:37.817
If this incident reflects poorly
on anyone, it'll be Darby.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.686
They disappeared on her watch.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.621
Let's not forget Summer.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.662
This is ridiculous.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.599
He either wants to come
with us, or he doesn't.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.134
But I'm not going to miss
registration, be disqualified,

18:55.168 --> 18:58.738
and risk getting kicked off the
World Team for some mind game.

19:14.421 --> 19:18.558
Look. Is Summer part of
the reason why you left?

19:18.591 --> 19:20.126
Because you don't have to
worry about her.

19:20.159 --> 19:25.164
She's back together with my dad
and totally over you.

19:25.198 --> 19:29.902
So if you come back, it's only
for the gymnastics. That's it.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.540
I'm not coming back.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.655
Well?

19:48.688 --> 19:52.592
I tried.
We should go.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.396
You go.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.299
Both of you. Emily, you've
gotta think about yourself.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.700
You're violating your contract.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.302
What about you?

20:02.335 --> 20:03.436
C'mon, Pay.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.637
I'm staying.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.373
I'll risk missing
this meet if I have to.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.308
But I won't risk Worlds
without Sasha.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.477
He won't let me go
back to Hungary alone.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.612
I mean it, go.

20:12.645 --> 20:17.750
Okay, but take
my credit card.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.588
Hire a car if you need to, just
get back in time for the Meet

20:21.621 --> 20:23.756
or there will be no Worlds
to worry about.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.692
Thank you.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.361
[Damon] Wow.
This is intense.

20:28.395 --> 20:32.732
You felt all this pressure to
win, and then when you did,

20:32.765 --> 20:34.834
you freaked out.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.637
Part of the reason I couldn't
talk about this is was because

20:37.670 --> 20:39.306
I felt so guilty.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.541
What in the world do I
have to bitch about?

20:41.574 --> 20:42.742
[stammering] I didn't say that.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.876
You didn't have to.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.578
It's how everyone sees me.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.647
A rich girl.
The pretty girl.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.550
I should have it all, right?

20:50.583 --> 20:53.653
[sighing] But I never
felt that way.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.722
Not inside.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.791
Inside I had no idea who I was.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.394
So I just focused on winning.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.364
I thought, if I could
win a major tournament,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.599
then maybe I'd feel like that

21:06.633 --> 21:09.802
super fabulous girl that
everybody thought I was.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.839
And then I won Nationals.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.874
But you didn't feel
any different.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.709
That's when I stopped eating.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.812
[Kaylie sighing] I thought
a big title would

21:19.846 --> 21:22.515
fix everything I was
feeling inside.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.551
It only made things worse.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.521
Sorry, this is probably more
than you wanted to know.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.991
But, I just, I wanted
to share this with you because,

21:32.024 --> 21:33.660
it was something that you said,

21:33.693 --> 21:37.630
about Emily, actually,
that made me realize

21:37.664 --> 21:40.967
gymnastics isn't the problem,
I am.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.471
I would have these issues
no matter what I do.

21:44.504 --> 21:48.040
Because it's who I am.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.711
And Emily is who she is.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.082
I just realized something too.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.588
I gotta' let her go.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.524
Even for her sake,
as much as mine.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.447
Payson!

22:28.815 --> 22:30.316
Where are Lauren and Emily?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.485
They already left.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.720
They took a train to Budapest.

22:33.753 --> 22:37.624
And I am not leaving
without Sasha.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.726
Honestly, I don't know
who's more stubborn,

22:39.759 --> 22:41.761
you or him.

22:55.007 --> 22:58.077
One of the hardest lessons
you'll learn at your age,

22:58.110 --> 23:01.681
is that you can't always
get what you want.

23:01.714 --> 23:05.552
What am I saying,
at any age.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.886
He's not coming back.

23:06.919 --> 23:11.123
And there is nothing you can say
or do to change his mind.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.593
I know that hurts.

23:13.626 --> 23:17.564
But, it's time to let go.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.999
And I'm not leaving
here without you.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.651
When you gave this
to me to hold,

23:38.685 --> 23:40.687
it represented
something special.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.623
Not just athletic triumph,

23:43.656 --> 23:46.726
but everything I believed
that you stood for:

23:46.759 --> 23:52.665
courage, strength,
kindness, perseverance...

23:52.699 --> 23:58.004
...and never, ever giving up.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.038
Now, when I look at it,

23:59.071 --> 24:01.741
all I can see is a quitter.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.444
You quit on me.
You quit on The Rock.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.614
You quit on everybody.

24:07.647 --> 24:11.484
So, here.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.085
I don't want it anymore.

24:27.667 --> 24:31.170
You have to understand that
she's angry and she's hurt.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.673
Yeah, I know.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.611
What about you?

24:38.645 --> 24:39.846
Are you angry at me too?

24:42.649 --> 24:45.752
I was. But I'm okay now.

24:46.953 --> 24:50.489
I understand why you felt
like you had to leave.

24:50.523 --> 24:55.194
I know that was about the girls,
and had nothing to do with us.

24:57.129 --> 25:01.100
Because you thought
you'd let the girls down,

25:01.133 --> 25:05.638
you thought your
presence was harming them.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.106
Thank you.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.808
I said I understand.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.910
I didn't say, I agree.

25:12.779 --> 25:15.682
All any of us can ask of
ourselves is that

25:15.715 --> 25:20.219
we do the best we can
with what we've been given.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.857
Being here. Doing this.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.493
It's not your best.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.928
You know it.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.908
Just... calm down...

25:41.941 --> 25:42.942
it doesn't help to panic...

25:42.975 --> 25:45.745
Deep breaths... you're
doing everything you can...

25:45.778 --> 25:48.615
[both] It'll all work out.
Good-bye.

25:50.950 --> 25:51.951
You first.

25:51.984 --> 25:52.985
That was Summer.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.721
She and Payson
had to rent a car.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.657
They got lost, but Summer thinks
she's figured out where they
are.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.593
Well, there's more good news.
I was talking to Darby.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.695
Lauren and Emily made it back.

26:02.729 --> 26:03.996
Thank God.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.967
[Kim sighing]
This is all my fault.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.301
I should have seen this coming.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.103
How?

26:11.137 --> 26:12.605
[stammering]
How could you have known?

26:12.639 --> 26:13.740
It's Payson.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.542
Once she discovered
where Sasha was...

26:16.575 --> 26:18.978
Sometimes she just
can't let it go.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.146
You know, it's funny.

26:20.179 --> 26:23.149
Our daughters are different
in so many ways.

26:23.182 --> 26:26.653
But when it comes to
going after things they want,

26:26.686 --> 26:28.755
they are amazingly similar.

26:28.788 --> 26:29.722
Willful?

26:29.756 --> 26:30.923
Bullheaded.

26:30.957 --> 26:34.260
Well, the sport
breeds that into them.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.996
It does but...
[sighs]

26:37.029 --> 26:40.066
Look I know Lauren
crosses the line.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.968
And... I'm sorry.

26:47.840 --> 26:52.979
Are you having a viewing party
tomorrow to watch the Meet?

26:53.012 --> 26:54.046
No.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.183
Really, I'm not.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.218
[chuckling]
Wanna come watch it here?

26:59.251 --> 27:03.055
Yeah. That sounds nice.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.057
[voice over PA]
For team registration,

27:05.091 --> 27:10.062
please check-in at the
registration table.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.765
Payson! You made it!

27:12.799 --> 27:14.400
What about Sasha?

27:16.168 --> 27:20.840
[stammering]
Sasha's not coming.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.109
Payson! Get over here
and sign in.

27:39.726 --> 27:40.960
What's up?

27:46.398 --> 27:48.667
I have something for you.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.240
You wrote me a song?

27:54.273 --> 27:56.943
More like you wrote me a song.

27:57.810 --> 27:58.811
Here.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.755
[guitar strumming]

28:14.693 --> 28:16.763
* I'm done holding back

28:16.796 --> 28:19.732
* I dropped the act

28:19.766 --> 28:24.837
* I was keeping it
together for too long*

28:24.871 --> 28:26.973
* I'm through running scared

28:27.006 --> 28:30.076
* From what's in there

28:30.109 --> 28:35.414
* It's not perfect,
but it's me **

28:42.188 --> 28:46.225
[sobbing]
This is everything I feel.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.963
How could you know?

28:54.133 --> 28:55.802
Because I get it.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.470
When I read what you wrote,

28:58.504 --> 29:02.708
it wasn't so much
a peek into your soul,

29:02.741 --> 29:05.077
as it was a question
of how you'd seen mine.

29:05.111 --> 29:09.081
And my 'Nationals' was
winning the radio contest.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.349
Opening for Green Day...

29:10.382 --> 29:14.253
A guy who couldn't even
sing in public?

29:14.286 --> 29:17.824
And I thought it would finally
make me feel like a star.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.892
And it didn't.

29:19.926 --> 29:23.429
And I fought that every day.
Until...

29:23.462 --> 29:24.730
...until now.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.033
Until I see you working
out your feelings

29:27.066 --> 29:29.168
with these words that you write.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.438
And I realize why
I do it in the first place.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.407
Not to be a star.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.011
Just to be me.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.450
[knocking on door]

29:59.031 --> 30:01.033
Let me be clear
about one thing...

30:01.067 --> 30:04.170
...if I was your coach you
would be on a plane headed for
home right now.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.205
What you did was inexcusable.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.340
If you think for one second
that I'm flattered you

30:08.374 --> 30:11.777
deserted your teammates and your
coach to come after me, think
again.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.013
Your performance against
Pinewood was an embarrassment.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.015
You've become lazy and
distracted and self-indulgent.

30:16.048 --> 30:19.018
To put it bluntly, I have zero
interest in being your coach.

30:20.853 --> 30:24.090
Unless you can prove to me
I won't be wasting my time.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.892
How do we do that?

30:25.925 --> 30:28.895
Show me you can win.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.931
I will see you at 8 a.m.
Now, get some sleep.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.510
[both screaming excitedly]

30:44.543 --> 30:49.048
[female announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome our
competitors.

30:49.081 --> 30:53.152
Entering the arena,
the team from Russia.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.122
[female announcer] And leading
the team, is their secret
weapon,

30:56.155 --> 30:57.890
Ivanka Kirilenko.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.591
That's right, secret because,
until today,

30:59.625 --> 31:02.962
she has never taken
part in an international
competition.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.464
[Sasha] Truth-telling time.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.935
I abandoned you.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.038
It was wrong of me
and I'm sorry for that.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.606
However, I am not
the only one here

31:14.640 --> 31:18.077
who is guilty of walking away
from something of value.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.947
Each one of you has turned
your back on the lessons I
worked to instill in you.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.381
Lessons about discipline...

31:22.414 --> 31:23.449
Focus...

31:23.482 --> 31:24.850
Accepting your limits...

31:24.883 --> 31:26.885
Humility... and trust.

31:26.919 --> 31:30.422
Now, I'm prepared to
make a commitment,

31:30.456 --> 31:33.892
a commitment to stay and coach
you until you are all on the
World's Team.

31:33.926 --> 31:37.063
But, first, I need to know that
you are prepared

31:37.096 --> 31:39.265
to re-dedicate yourselves to the
pursuit of excellence,

31:39.298 --> 31:44.103
that you will dig deeper and
work harder to make the most of
your talents and your potential.

31:44.136 --> 31:47.206
If you can do that,
put your hand in.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.011
[all] Rock on!

31:52.044 --> 31:55.147
The team from the
United States of America.

31:56.082 --> 32:00.119
[crowd cheering, applauding]

32:10.129 --> 32:11.097
[male announcer]
Is that... Is that?

32:11.130 --> 32:13.065
[female announcer] Yes.
Sasha Belov

32:13.099 --> 32:16.268
is accompanying interim U.S.
Team Coach Josh Randall into
the stadium.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.570
Does that mean he is coaching
in the U.S. again?

32:18.604 --> 32:21.007
It's Sasha Belov.
Who can tell with him?

32:21.040 --> 32:23.042
Would you let him back?

32:23.075 --> 32:27.146
Honestly, Kim? We've both
given up so much time

32:27.179 --> 32:29.415
and money trying to get our
girls to the Olympics.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.985
If he's the way there,
My arms are open.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.253
Let's have some wine.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.088
- Where's the opener?
- Right over there!

32:36.122 --> 32:37.589
[crowd cheering, applauding]

32:41.193 --> 32:43.529
[crowd murmuring]

32:46.665 --> 32:48.967
The NGO view this meet
as a warm-up for Worlds.

32:49.001 --> 32:50.969
So, Josh Randall may well
be your coach at Worlds.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.672
It's imperative you show him
Pinewood was a fluke,

32:53.705 --> 32:56.242
that you remind them
you belong here.

32:56.275 --> 32:59.978
[female announcer] Lauren Tanner
up on the beam for Team U.S.A.

33:00.012 --> 33:03.015
[male announcer] Is it safe to
say that Lauren is the favorite
to win this event?

33:03.049 --> 33:05.617
[female announcer] She certainly
has the high degree of
difficulty.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.687
But there's been talk that
Lauren and some of the other
U.S. girls

33:08.720 --> 33:10.989
have under-performed recently.

33:11.023 --> 33:14.126
It'll be interesting to see if
there's any truth to that.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.471
[crowd cheering, applauding]

34:01.740 --> 34:05.677
[female announcer] Next up on
the beam, representing Russia,
is Ivanka Kirilenko.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.047
[male announcer] Or simply
'Ivanka' as she prefers to be
known.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.417
[female announcer] We've
heard a lot of talk about
Ivanka,

34:11.450 --> 34:13.552
but very little is actually
known. Why is that?

34:13.585 --> 34:17.189
[male announcer] Most likely,
it's a strategic move on the
part of the Russian Federation.

34:17.223 --> 34:21.160
Keeping her out of the public
eye, and then revealing her at
the last minute.

34:21.193 --> 34:24.130
[up-tempo music throughout]

34:37.776 --> 34:40.746
[crowd cheering, applauding]

35:08.240 --> 35:11.177
[cheering, whistling,
applauding]

35:12.878 --> 35:14.079
Wow.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.714
Where did she come from?

35:15.747 --> 35:18.150
[female announcer] I think it's
safe to say a gymnastic star is
born.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.186
[male announcer] And with that
performance,

35:20.219 --> 35:21.820
Ivanka not only scored higher
than Lauren Tanner,

35:21.853 --> 35:26.192
but the Russian Team has moved
into first place ahead of the
U.S.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.466
[crowd cheering, applauding]

35:34.500 --> 35:37.135
[Emily sighing]

35:37.169 --> 35:40.105
Emily, listen to me.
Repeat after me.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.308
I am the best.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.377
I am the best.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.613
And nobody can touch me.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.419
And nobody can touch me.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.562
[female announcer]
Emily Kmetko. Uneven bars.

36:03.595 --> 36:08.867
The U.S. needs a strong
performance here if they hope
to challenge the Russian Team.

36:43.235 --> 36:44.303
[thud]
[grunts]

36:44.336 --> 36:45.971
[crowd groans collectively]

36:50.376 --> 36:51.843
[crowd applauds sparingly]

36:53.412 --> 36:55.847
A disappointing performance
from Emily Kmetko.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.816
[male announcer] Everything that
could possibly go wrong, did.

36:57.849 --> 37:03.322
And that's going to drop the
U.S. into third place behind
Russia and Romania.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.656
I'm pulling Emily.

37:04.690 --> 37:08.394
I'm going with Kelly Parker
the rest of the way.

37:09.695 --> 37:12.298
She's too big a risk.

37:12.331 --> 37:15.601
Kelly hasn't competed
since she hurt her ankle.

37:15.634 --> 37:16.902
Emily can do this.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.538
She just needs to know
that you believe in her.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.274
That's the problem. I don't.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.686
I don't know what happened.
But I can do better.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.256
I know I will do better.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.763
I'm so sorry, Emily.

37:44.796 --> 37:45.897
[female announcer] There has
been a replacement.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.034
In for Emily Kmetko
is Kelly Parker.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.605
[rock music plays]

38:03.549 --> 38:04.916
[crowd cheering, applauding]

38:04.950 --> 38:06.952
[female announcer] A perfect
vault from Kelly Parker.

38:06.985 --> 38:11.423
And that puts the U.S.A.
back in the running.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.925
It's between the U.S.
and Russia for the team gold.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.495
And it's going to come down to
how they match up on floor.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.897
[female announcer] And both
teams have saved their best for
last.

38:18.930 --> 38:23.369
It's Payson Keeler for the
U.S. and Ivanka for Russia.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.003
[crowd cheering]

38:26.304 --> 38:28.374
[piano music]

39:07.012 --> 39:09.080
[crowd applauding]

39:28.867 --> 39:31.069
[cheering, applauding]

39:40.111 --> 39:42.380
[whistling, cheering]

39:47.786 --> 39:50.856
Relax. She's going to do great.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.390
She is great.

39:52.424 --> 39:55.994
[female announcer] Now on floor,
Payson Keeler.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.028
[orchestral music]

40:38.203 --> 40:40.739
[crowd cheering, applauding]

41:05.531 --> 41:07.465
[whistling, cheering]

41:07.499 --> 41:09.768
Woo-hoo!
Whoa!

41:13.939 --> 41:15.974
[cheering continues]

41:17.709 --> 41:18.944
It's up to the judges, now.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.779
It's going to be very close.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.481
[female announcer] The judges
are tabulating the scores.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.528
[female announcer]
The final scores are in.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.697
And the Russian team
takes the gold.

41:38.730 --> 41:43.168
The U.S. captures silver
and the bronze goes to Romania.

41:55.947 --> 41:59.818
I'm Kaylie... just Kaylie.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.554
Maybe that's enough.

42:02.588 --> 42:06.925
I know it should be,
I hope it will be,

42:06.958 --> 42:08.660
I'm a work-in-progress.

42:08.694 --> 42:13.164
But, whatever I am,
whoever I am,

42:13.198 --> 42:14.866
I deserve to be happy.

42:14.900 --> 42:19.037
Good. Very good, Kaylie.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.578
You know, I could have
gotten them there.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.680
Perhaps. In time.

42:28.714 --> 42:29.848
But we don't have time.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.549
And you're so sure you can get
them to Worlds,

42:31.583 --> 42:34.252
- where I couldn't?
- Yes.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.088
Emily, the Chairman of the
Hungarian National Committee

42:37.122 --> 42:39.625
would like to speak with you.

42:40.058 --> 42:40.926
Why?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.595
I don't know.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.084
Thank you both for coming.

43:06.117 --> 43:07.686
This is a bit awkward.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.123
We came across something of
concern with a test

43:12.157 --> 43:14.159
we performed on
your urine sample.

43:17.796 --> 43:21.132
No! Wait! It was just an energy
drink! I promise.

43:21.166 --> 43:23.201
I didn't even know
what was in it.

43:25.270 --> 43:28.606
Emily, this isn't about
banned substances.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.677
You haven't broken any rules.

43:31.710 --> 43:33.011
Then, what is this about?

43:35.681 --> 43:38.016
It seems you're pregnant.
