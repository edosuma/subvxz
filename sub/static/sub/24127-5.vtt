WEBVTT

00:00.208 --> 00:03.458
I gotta get going

00:03.458 --> 00:05.875
a friend of mine

00:05.875 --> 00:09.416
I love him because

00:09.416 --> 00:12.750
Winnie the Pooh bear

00:12.750 --> 00:16.458
Chasing some honey

00:16.458 --> 00:19.750
I know he's out there

00:19.750 --> 00:23.291
climbing a honey tree

00:23.291 --> 00:26.500
We're so adventurous

00:26.500 --> 00:29.875
now and again

00:29.875 --> 00:32.875
and there's nobody home

00:32.875 --> 00:36.500
to count on a friend

00:36.500 --> 00:39.875
Winnie the Pooh bear

00:39.875 --> 00:43.250
Oh won't you take me please

00:43.250 --> 00:46.750
I gotta be there

00:46.750 --> 00:52.750
A silly old Winnie the Pooh

01:08.458 --> 01:11.333
Christopher Robin:
Mom, I'm going out to play.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.458
Mom:
Have you cleaned up
the living room?

01:13.458 --> 01:15.083
Of course.

01:15.083 --> 01:18.000
Well, almost.
Kind of, anyway.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.625
I mean, I sort of
cleaned up some of it.

01:21.625 --> 01:24.000
I guess it could
be a little cleaner.

01:24.375 --> 01:27.250
Christopher Robin,
you can play after

01:27.250 --> 01:28.875
you've picked up this mess.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.125
Yes, Mom.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.875
I'm going shopping but
I'll be back in an hour.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.708
An hour?
Okay.

01:35.708 --> 01:39.000
That should give you plenty
of time to get this room clean.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.708
Right, Mom.

01:40.708 --> 01:44.083
And be extra careful around
Great-Grandfather Eustace.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.375
Your dear, dear aunt
gave me this.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.416
I know, Mom.

01:48.416 --> 01:50.500
It's been in the family
for generations.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.166
And I can't let
anything happen to it.

01:53.166 --> 01:56.583
Yes, I'll be careful.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.875
Maybe you've been in
the family for generations,

01:59.875 --> 02:02.083
but I've been in
this house all day.

02:02.083 --> 02:04.583
And I think I ought to get
to go out.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.208
It's my right as a kid.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.708
What do you have
to say to that?

02:08.708 --> 02:09.708
Oh, bother.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.958
There is perhaps
no sadder sight

02:13.958 --> 02:16.500
than the bottom of
an empty honey pot.

02:16.500 --> 02:20.500
Christopher Robin, you are
running very late indeed.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.458
We were expecting
you at precisely half
past some time ago.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.875
Yes, this was the day
we were going to capture

02:26.875 --> 02:29.000
a blue-nosed yellow-bellied
house-fly.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.875
And times fun
when you're having flies.

02:31.875 --> 02:33.750
So let's bounce
on out of here.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.000
I'm afraid I can't
come with you.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.875
Mom said I can't come out
until I'm finished cleaning.

02:39.875 --> 02:42.833
Hmm, what's the use
of making a mess

02:42.833 --> 02:44.458
if you gotta clean it up?

02:44.458 --> 02:46.333
Well, perhaps it would
help if we helped you?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.875
Certainly, with all
of us working,

02:48.875 --> 02:50.708
we ought to have this place
cleaned up in no time.

02:50.708 --> 02:53.625
Right, Bunny-boy, two heads
are better than none.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.208
Yeah, okay.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.833
But we have to be
really careful

02:56.833 --> 02:59.125
around
Great-Grandfather Eustace.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.583
Oh, Christopher Robin,

03:01.583 --> 03:04.208
what has become of
the rest of Great-Grandfather?

03:04.208 --> 03:06.708
Silly old bear,
it's just a bust.

03:06.708 --> 03:09.166
You know, a statue.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.583
You can lead a bear to honey,
but you can't make him think.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.875
Now, let's get rid
of this mess

03:16.875 --> 03:19.875
so we can get down to
some serious playing.

03:22.750 --> 03:27.166
The first thing you
gotta know is you can't
toy around with toys.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.958
Come out, come out,
whoever you are.

03:33.291 --> 03:37.250
Let's quit clowning around
and get this place cleaned up.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.875
Ahoy, your admiraltiness,

03:40.875 --> 03:43.208
how about getting
things ship-shape?

03:43.208 --> 03:44.875
Oh!

03:56.708 --> 03:59.416
All right, enough of
the fun and games.

03:59.416 --> 04:00.875
Play-time's over
and done with.

04:03.583 --> 04:08.166
Well, um, I didn't
mean play-time's over
for good, you know.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.250
Whoa!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.375
Hi-ho, Sylvia!

04:16.708 --> 04:19.333
You better do what I say,
or you'll have to eat

04:19.333 --> 04:21.875
nothing but cauliflowered
kumquats for a year.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.833
Hmm.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.583
If I was Christopher Robin's
mom, I wonder what I'd do.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.583
I know!

04:35.583 --> 04:37.000
Help!

04:41.333 --> 04:44.625
Oh, Tigger, I believe
the mess is slightly messier

04:44.625 --> 04:46.208
than it was before.

04:47.291 --> 04:49.166
I appreciate the help,

04:49.166 --> 04:52.833
but I'm afraid this won't
be very much fun.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.458
Well, sure it won't be fun,

04:54.458 --> 04:57.125
that's why you
gotta make it fun.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.500
How?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.375
First you grab
one of these,

05:00.375 --> 05:01.583
then you call out fore!

05:01.583 --> 05:04.416
Or maybe even
four and three quarters!

05:08.625 --> 05:11.625
Hmm, mere child's
play, Tigger.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.083
Just watch this.

05:13.083 --> 05:16.833
Squish ball in
the corner pocket.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.583
Such a very large job
for a very small me.

05:24.583 --> 05:26.583
And a train, as you see,

05:26.583 --> 05:30.083
can easily be trained to help.

05:34.750 --> 05:35.750
Yikes!

05:36.750 --> 05:37.750
Oh, bother!

05:41.125 --> 05:42.958
I've been taking juggling
lessons by mail.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.583
And now, for
the coup de gracey.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.583
Careful, Tigger.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.958
Oh, my!

06:10.125 --> 06:11.583
Oh, no!

06:11.583 --> 06:13.166
I got it, I got it!

06:13.166 --> 06:15.208
I'm gonna get it.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.583
Oh, my.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.625
Oh, dear.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.833
Oh, bother.

06:20.833 --> 06:24.166
Oh, no, Great-Grandfather!

06:24.166 --> 06:26.708
What am I gonna do now?

06:26.708 --> 06:30.208
Now, now, don't worry,
Christopher Robin.

06:30.208 --> 06:32.375
We'll, we'll...

06:32.375 --> 06:35.125
We'll simply fix it,
that's all.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.625
Exact-tackily.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.958
I'll unbust this
bust for you.

06:38.958 --> 06:42.958
I hope you can, Tigger.
It's been in the family forever.

06:42.958 --> 06:46.500
Fixin' what needs fixin'
is what Tiggers do the best.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.458
See?

06:49.458 --> 06:52.375
Tigger, that wasn't how
he looked at all,

06:52.375 --> 06:56.708
Why he's a regular chip
off the old spitting image.

06:56.708 --> 07:00.416
Never send a Tigger
to do a Rabbit's job.

07:00.416 --> 07:01.875
I'll take care of this.

07:01.875 --> 07:02.875
Glue?

07:02.875 --> 07:04.166
Yes, Rabbit.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.458
I said glue, Pooh,
not you, Pooh.

07:06.458 --> 07:07.708
I need glue.

07:07.708 --> 07:11.416
But Rabbit, all I
have is honey.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.333
I suppose honey
will have to do.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.750
- Brush.
- Brush.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.458
Perfection.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.083
It's very nice, Rabbit.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.083
But it's sort of cracked.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.875
Nonsense, your mother will
never know the difference.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.958
My masterpiece!

07:42.958 --> 07:44.625
My goodness!

07:44.625 --> 07:46.250
My honey!

07:46.250 --> 07:48.000
My life!

07:48.000 --> 07:49.333
It's over!

07:49.333 --> 07:50.958
Mom is gonna
be furious.

07:50.958 --> 07:53.958
I broke Great-Grandfather.

07:53.958 --> 07:57.458
When you break something that
wasn't supposed to be broken,

07:57.458 --> 07:59.875
there's only one
thing to do...

08:03.208 --> 08:04.958
And that's hide it.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Now what am I gonna do?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.875
I can't go back home.

08:14.875 --> 08:17.083
Well, if you can't
go back there,

08:17.083 --> 08:18.583
then just stay out here.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.458
No, I can't do that.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.416
Well, why not?

08:23.416 --> 08:25.000
Yes, why not?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.500
Well, because, uh...

08:28.500 --> 08:29.708
Um...

08:29.708 --> 08:32.125
You see?
No reason you shouldn't.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.333
So you might
as well should.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.250
Yes, but I... I...

08:35.250 --> 08:36.416
The "I"s have it.

08:36.416 --> 08:39.125
Come on to my house,
kiddo.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.875
Wait right here while
I tidy up a bit.

08:44.875 --> 08:48.166
Got to make sure
the doilies are dusted.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.125
Well, what do you think?

08:59.125 --> 09:00.875
Spacy-ous, isn't it?

09:00.875 --> 09:03.416
But how can you
stay in there,

09:03.416 --> 09:05.750
Christopher Robin,
if in there

09:05.750 --> 09:08.083
is now out here?

09:08.083 --> 09:11.250
Perhaps you could stay in
my house, Christopher Robin?

09:19.208 --> 09:22.000
I'd be happy to stay
in your house, Piglet,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.708
if I could get
into your house.

09:24.708 --> 09:28.750
Just possibly, if you
heave and I ho,

09:28.750 --> 09:29.958
you may get in.

09:29.958 --> 09:34.458
- Heave.
- Ho.

09:34.458 --> 09:37.125
With me now.
Heave.

09:37.125 --> 09:40.125
Ho-oh!
Ho, ho, hold it, Tigger!

09:40.125 --> 09:43.291
I don't think I'm ever
going to get in.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.416
Then perhaps we'd better
try to get you out.

09:46.416 --> 09:50.458
This is gonna take some
heavy duty heaving and ho-ing.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.166
Come on, guys.

09:53.708 --> 09:55.166
On the count of three...

09:55.166 --> 09:57.458
A-one, and a-two.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.958
Hiya, Christopher Robin.

10:00.958 --> 10:04.833
Oh, I'm afraid we
very small animals

10:04.833 --> 10:07.250
do live in very small houses.

10:07.250 --> 10:09.000
Um, say there, Piglet,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.083
I think I broke that lamp
by your back door.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.458
But I don't have
a back door.

10:14.458 --> 10:16.708
You do now.

10:16.708 --> 10:20.833
Perhaps you should come to
my house, Christopher Robin.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.625
I believe my rooms may
be a bit roomier.

10:31.375 --> 10:34.458
It seems I forget to
clean up after breakfast.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.250
Come alone, Christopher Robin.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.458
You'll stay with me.

10:40.458 --> 10:43.250
You're more than welcome
to stay at my house.

10:43.250 --> 10:46.166
Although I did just
wax my floors.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.833
So you'll have to be sure
to wipe your shoes.

10:48.833 --> 10:52.416
Otherwise, I am glad to
have you as my house guest.

10:52.416 --> 10:55.583
Although I did just
re-arrange my closet.

10:55.583 --> 10:58.583
so there won't be any place
for you to put your things.

10:58.583 --> 11:01.458
And I really can't have
anyone in my kitchen but me.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.583
So you won't be
able to eat.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.458
And, uh...

11:05.458 --> 11:09.458
Are you sure mine
is the home for you,
Christopher Robin?

11:09.458 --> 11:12.583
But Rabbit, I've tried
everywhere else.

11:12.583 --> 11:15.125
Well, not everywhere.

11:15.125 --> 11:18.458
Just finished it
this morning.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.750
Built to last the ages.

11:20.750 --> 11:25.000
Using all the finest
timbers.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.458
Be glad for you to
call it home, too.

11:28.458 --> 11:31.625
Thanks, Eeyore.
I'd be honored to stay here.

11:35.166 --> 11:38.416
Oh, well, nothing
lasts forever.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.625
I don't know what
I'm gonna do now.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.625
Mom'll be back soon,
so I can't go home.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.458
And I can't stay here.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.708
It looks like there's nowhere
for me to go.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.708
Oh, bother.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.958
I know you've done
your best to help me,

12:04.958 --> 12:08.583
but I guess this something
I gotta figure out on my own.

12:08.583 --> 12:11.000
Poor Christopher Robin.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.708
I do wish we
could help him.

12:13.708 --> 12:16.875
Yes, we should be able
to help him somehow.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.250
Seems to me what
he really needs

12:19.250 --> 12:22.291
is help finding
his way home.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.250
Home! Of course!

12:24.250 --> 12:26.333
Why didn't I think
of it before?

12:26.333 --> 12:29.250
Yeah, why didn't you
think of it before?

12:29.250 --> 12:31.416
Um... now what was
it you thought of

12:31.416 --> 12:32.833
that you didn't
think of before?

12:32.833 --> 12:35.125
If Christopher Robin
needs a home,

12:35.125 --> 12:37.125
we must build him a home.

12:37.125 --> 12:40.000
Actually, what I meant was--

12:40.000 --> 12:43.166
Come along, everyone,
we must work quickly.

12:43.166 --> 12:47.458
I mean he's gotta get back
to his own home.

12:57.708 --> 13:01.208
Piglet, have you
finished the plans?

13:01.208 --> 13:03.625
Yes, Rabbit, I have.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.875
And I think it turned out
very nicely indeed.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.625
Hmm, not bad at all.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.083
A bit basic, perhaps.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.333
But Christopher Robin must be
able to store his playthings.

13:14.333 --> 13:17.291
He'll need more room.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.458
A second floor, I think.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.333
And another room here.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.958
One over there, yes.

13:23.958 --> 13:25.375
Something up here.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.000
That should do it.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.875
But there's nowhere for him
to park his bicycle.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.750
You better add a garage
for him, Piglet.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.416
And he's got to have a
swinging set to swing on,

13:35.416 --> 13:38.000
with a slide and a see-saw
and a merry-going-round.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.000
Perhaps he should
have a guest house,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.208
for when we come
to pay a visit.

13:43.208 --> 13:46.166
Sure and where's
the swimming pool?

13:46.166 --> 13:48.333
And of course, it needs
a garden.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.416
There.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.208
It's perfect!

13:52.208 --> 13:55.000
Christopher Robin
will love it.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.291
But, uh, Piglet,
where's the basement?

14:03.583 --> 14:07.250
Hello, Christopher Robin.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.500
Hello, Eeyore.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.583
Going on a visit,
I see.

14:11.583 --> 14:15.416
No, I've decided to
run away from home.

14:15.416 --> 14:20.000
Seems to me home's the kind
of place you ought to run to.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
But Eeyore,
I don't have any choice!

14:23.000 --> 14:24.416
Mom:
Christopher Robin?

14:24.416 --> 14:27.708
Christopher Robin,
where are you?

14:27.708 --> 14:29.958
Oh, no! It's Mom!

14:29.958 --> 14:31.000
I have to go.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.458
Goodbye, Eeyore.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.250
There, we've finished!

14:38.250 --> 14:40.000
Why, it's stupend-i-ous.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.500
It's collosical.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.958
It's downright
disastrous!

14:42.958 --> 14:44.875
But where's the door?

14:44.875 --> 14:47.416
Oh, dear.

14:47.416 --> 14:51.250
What say we put it
right here?

14:51.250 --> 14:53.583
Wonderful!

14:53.583 --> 14:55.458
Now Pooh Bear,
you call Christopher Robin,

14:55.458 --> 14:58.458
and tell him his
house is ready.

14:58.458 --> 15:01.583
Christopher Robin!

15:01.583 --> 15:03.625
Pooh Bear, he's not here.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.833
Go look for him
elsewhere.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.583
Of course, Rabbit.

15:10.750 --> 15:14.166
And where exactly
is elsewhere?

15:15.750 --> 15:17.250
That way.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.458
Christopher... Robin?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.875
Oh, Christopher Robin, there's
something I must tell you.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.208
I don't have
time, Pooh Bear,
I have to go.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.458
Mom:
Christopher Robin!

15:32.458 --> 15:34.000
Where are you?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Come on, you can come with me.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.958
With you where?

15:37.958 --> 15:41.708
Well, I suppose I won't really
know until I get there.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.250
But the others
and myself--

15:44.250 --> 15:46.000
You're right, Pooh,
we should leave them a note

15:46.000 --> 15:47.458
so they know we've gone.

15:47.458 --> 15:51.958
I believe "Tigger" is spelled
with two "grrs".

15:51.958 --> 15:54.833
Now, let's get
your things together.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.125
That Pooh Bear is as slow
as day-old honey.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.958
Oh, my,

16:02.958 --> 16:05.416
Perhaps we'd better go find
Christopher Robin ourselves.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.875
Not the best day for
running away from home.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.458
Assuming there is
such a day.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.458
What's this?

16:20.458 --> 16:23.708
"Dear Rabbit, Tigger,
and Piglet."

16:23.708 --> 16:26.625
Hey, they left out
a "grr".

16:26.625 --> 16:29.125
We have run away
from home,

16:29.125 --> 16:31.875
Signed, Christopher Robin
and Pooh.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.875
P.S. Send honey."

16:35.458 --> 16:37.708
Run away from home?
That's terri-bib-le.

16:37.708 --> 16:42.000
Yes, especially in
weather such as this.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.333
We've got to find them.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.458
Where could they
have gone?

16:49.458 --> 16:52.625
Why, I bet they're headed for
the very ends of the earth,

16:52.625 --> 16:55.458
and with this much headstart,
they're probably halfway
there by now.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.458
Have we run away
yet, Christopher Robin?

17:10.458 --> 17:12.458
Not yet, Pooh.

17:12.458 --> 17:15.166
We still have
a long way to go.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.166
And when shall we be
done running away,

17:18.166 --> 17:19.625
and ready to begin
running back?

17:19.625 --> 17:22.708
There won't be any
running back, Pooh bear.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.000
This is forever.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.458
Isn't forever a
rather long time,
Christopher Robin?

17:30.458 --> 17:32.708
Yes, Pooh.

17:32.708 --> 17:37.125
Well, then, perhaps
there's time to stop
for a small smackerel?

17:37.125 --> 17:40.208
Yes, I guess we could
rest for a little while.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.000
Oh, bother.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.708
It's empty.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.875
Uh-huh.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.708
Could be a clue.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.500
Can't be too far ahead,

18:11.500 --> 18:14.583
the honey's still warm.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.958
Not even a day old.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.125
Uh, Christopher Robin?

18:32.125 --> 18:34.833
Won't your mother be
worried about you?

18:34.833 --> 18:37.250
Well, maybe.

18:37.250 --> 18:41.166
I guess, but I can't go home
after what I did, Pooh.

18:41.166 --> 18:46.208
Oh. Will the place to which
we are running away have honey?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.333
Of course, Pooh Bear.
I mean...

18:48.333 --> 18:51.458
It should.
Most places do.

18:52.958 --> 18:54.833
Hello.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.416
Don't get up
on my account.

18:57.416 --> 18:59.083
Eeyore!

18:59.083 --> 19:01.583
Oh, are you running away from
home too, Eeyore?

19:01.583 --> 19:04.333
Don't see how I could,

19:04.333 --> 19:07.625
since I don't have a home
to run away from.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.291
Brought you this.

19:10.291 --> 19:12.750
Thought you might be
getting wet,

19:12.750 --> 19:15.458
seeing how it's
raining and all.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.166
Thank you, Eeyore.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.708
I can't believe we're
in this terrible mess,

19:19.708 --> 19:22.000
just because I broke
some dumb statue.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.166
Yep, it was
a mistake all right.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.875
Everybody makes 'em.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.208
Made a few of my own.

19:30.208 --> 19:33.708
But there's no running
away from them.

19:33.708 --> 19:37.708
I don't know, Eeyore, I guess
maybe you're somewhat right.

19:37.708 --> 19:40.125
In a way, sort of.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.875
It's awfully wet out here,
isn't it, Pooh?

19:44.875 --> 19:48.583
It's not quite as
dry as home,
Christopher Robin.

19:48.583 --> 19:52.416
This really isn't any place
for a bear, is it, Eeyore?

19:52.416 --> 19:54.708
No place at all.

19:54.708 --> 19:58.708
I suppose I should get Pooh
back where it's warm and dry.

19:58.708 --> 20:01.000
I thank you,
Christopher Robin.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.875
And my honey
thanks you, too.

20:13.875 --> 20:16.250
Poor Christopher Robin.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.458
Poor Pooh.

20:18.458 --> 20:21.291
I hope they're having
fun out there at
the end of the earth.

20:21.291 --> 20:25.500
Actually, Tigger, we only
went to the end of the block.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.375
Pooh, you're back!

20:27.375 --> 20:29.375
And Christopher Robin!

20:29.375 --> 20:31.291
Oh, we're very
glad to see you.

20:31.291 --> 20:33.000
You had us
worried sick.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.375
Yep, I tracked 'em down,
brought 'em back sound and safe.

20:38.375 --> 20:41.000
No need to throw me
any parades.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.333
Christopher Robin, we have
a surprise for you.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.250
A surprise?

20:48.875 --> 20:51.500
Your new home.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.333
It's, um... very nice.

20:54.333 --> 20:57.000
But I'm afraid
I can't live here.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.458
You can't?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.333
Why not, Christopher Robin?

21:00.333 --> 21:02.500
I knew we should have
built that garage.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.250
I have to go home,

21:04.250 --> 21:07.458
to my own home to face up
to what I did.

21:07.458 --> 21:12.583
But thank you for all
the trouble you went to.

21:12.583 --> 21:16.166
Well, I suppose this means
we can all go home.

21:16.166 --> 21:18.250
Never mind me.

21:18.250 --> 21:22.000
The one with no home
to go home to.

21:24.458 --> 21:27.416
Always dreamed of
having a dream house,

21:27.416 --> 21:29.166
just like this one.

21:29.166 --> 21:31.833
Has a few holes
in the roof.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.458
They'll let in the rain.

21:34.458 --> 21:37.458
Of course, they'll let
the sun in, too.

21:37.458 --> 21:40.708
If it's just gonna
sit there, unused,

21:40.708 --> 21:45.375
would anybody object to
me moving in?

21:45.375 --> 21:48.375
Why, of course not,
Donkey Boy.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.583
This home is your
home, Eeyore.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.125
Oh, bother.

22:02.083 --> 22:05.750
Home.
No place like it.
