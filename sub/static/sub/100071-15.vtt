But <i>we're</i> not addicted, you are!

12:19.839 --> 12:21.674

12:21.741 --> 12:23.843

13:28.141 --> 13:29.742
I just have one question.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.446
How much does this place cost?

13:33.513 --> 13:35.882
Your stay is entirely
funded by donations

13:35.948 --> 13:38.785
from tech billionaires,
who feel guilty

13:38.851 --> 13:42.722
that their sleek, disruptive
technology put you here.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.791
(gasps) It's free?

13:44.857 --> 13:47.960
Kids, we've found
our summer home.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.763
The adults will
reconnect with healthier,

13:50.830 --> 13:53.266
time‐tested alternatives

13:53.333 --> 13:55.768
like eating,
drinking, fornicating,

13:55.835 --> 13:58.771
relentless hide‐and‐seek,
the braiding of hair,

13:58.838 --> 14:01.641

15:25.892 --> 15:27.660

15:39.071 --> 15:40.106

15:40.173 --> 15:42.008
Okay, okay. Let's just talk.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.744
Any subject...

15:46.746 --> 15:48.748

16:04.697 --> 16:07.767
The gas is never a good sign.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.038
I have to say,
all this talk about no devices

16:12.104 --> 16:14.307
has really made me
want my phone.

16:14.373 --> 16:17.310
I know, I was talking with
some guys about the weather,

16:17.376 --> 16:19.545
and I realized I have no idea

16:19.612 --> 16:21.647
what the temperature is
in Cupertino.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.649
‐I need my phone.
‐Me, too.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.486
What if Krusty posted a tweet?!

addictive than heroin.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.069
Google and TikTok
say that's a lie.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.871
We have to be cured.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.907
You couldn't be
more wrong, Marge.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.710
You couldn't be more wrong.

16:50.776 --> 16:54.380
Since this nation was founded,
families have faced the problem

16:54.447 --> 16:57.884
of staying together without
driving each other crazy.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.086
For the first 200 years,
they played fiddle music

17:00.152 --> 17:01.587
until they had a war.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.356
It was a good system.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.691
Then, they came up
with sitting around a radio.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.694
But without a screen, they still
had time to look at each other.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.697
So... World War II.

17:11.764 --> 17:15.167
With peace came TV, which bought
Silicon Valley the time

17:15.234 --> 17:18.838
to invent the devices
that isolate us completely.

17:18.905 --> 17:22.608
Finally, the American family
was safe...

17:22.675 --> 17:24.644
from itself.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.746
Is any of that true?

17:26.812 --> 17:28.614
Once I post it on Reddit,

17:28.681 --> 17:30.650
it will be.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.285
Okay, we'll just say goodbye

17:32.351 --> 17:34.253
and then we'll get our things.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.489
What's going on here?

17:36.556 --> 17:39.458
I thought this was
a screen‐free environment.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.127
It is, for the patients.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.597

side hustles to perpetrate.
