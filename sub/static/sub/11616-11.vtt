00:00.001 --> 00:03.302
Given the threat of
bioterrorism, this is now

00:03.304 --> 00:04.303
a matter of national security.

00:04.305 --> 00:06.405
<i> As such, I recommend</i>

00:06.407 --> 00:08.407
<i> that we institute</i>
<i> top-level containment measures</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:09.942
<i> to protect the citizens</i>
<i> of this city.</i>

00:09.944 --> 00:12.845
If this was just a moment in
time, I just want you to know

00:12.847 --> 00:14.046
I'm still glad I met you.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.414
JAKE:
<i> There's no version of my life</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:16.982
<i> that doesn't have you in it.</i>

00:16.984 --> 00:19.618
That doesn't look good.
I'll go ask Dr. Cannerts

00:19.620 --> 00:20.419
<i> for some medicine.</i>

00:20.421 --> 00:21.687
SCOTT:
<i> We have a situation.</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:23.489
<i> The group of protesters</i>
<i> is growing.</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:24.189
Give me that!

00:24.191 --> 00:25.691
No, stop! (groans)

00:25.693 --> 00:27.393
Where's Mary?
We had to leave her.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.561
BRITNEY: She got sick.
What, you mean, like, sick sick?

00:30.264 --> 00:31.897
Put her down. Please.

00:31.899 --> 00:32.931
Just put her down.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.066
The whole damn thing is Lommers.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.200
She's playing you.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.036
I want you to resign.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.637
I'll call a press
conference...

00:38.639 --> 00:39.671
And you will resign.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.474
You look good.

Proud of you.

You look good, son.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.715
Thanks, Pop.

01:23.717 --> 01:27.519
I know this won't be easy,
but you'll feel better

01:27.521 --> 01:30.689
when the press
conference is over.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.191
So you ready?

01:32.193 --> 01:33.559
I'm ready.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.465
LOMMERS:
<i> Thank you for coming.</i>

01:39.467 --> 01:41.834
I have prepared
a brief statement.

01:41.836 --> 01:44.703
I won't be taking any questions.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.038
Over the last 16 days,

01:46.040 --> 01:49.241
this city has been stretched
to its breaking point

01:49.243 --> 01:51.910
by a crisis that has
tested all of us.

01:51.912 --> 01:56.615
I'm here today to confess
that you have been misled.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.083
(quiet murmuring)

01:58.085 --> 02:00.752
The Syrian national,
Sayid Nassir,

02:00.754 --> 02:02.788
was not Patient Zero.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.991
In fact, Mr. Nassir was nothing
more than an innocent victim.

02:05.993 --> 02:09.027
The virus was manipulated
in a lab

02:09.029 --> 02:10.662
here, in our own country,

02:10.664 --> 02:12.998
through a dangerous
and irresponsible

02:13.000 --> 02:14.299
gain-of-function study.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.703
Though sometimes beneficial
in this day and age,

02:17.705 --> 02:20.439
where the threat
of bioterrorism looms large,

02:20.441 --> 02:22.341
these studies are
currently not permissible

02:22.343 --> 02:24.743
in the United States,
due to the potential

02:24.745 --> 02:27.546
for accidental outbreaks
like this one.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.548
And that's what this was.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.816
An accident.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.850
Nothing more.

02:31.852 --> 02:35.721
Disclosing this information
publicly is difficult,

02:35.723 --> 02:39.892
but I promised you transparency,
and so here we are.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.627
(cameras clicking)

02:44.331 --> 02:47.966
This virus was created
by a scientist at the CDC

02:47.968 --> 02:49.601
named Dr. Victor Cannerts.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.405
When another researcher
was accidentally exposed,

02:53.407 --> 02:56.175
Dr. Cannerts lied to
his superiors and to the world

02:56.177 --> 02:58.177
about its origin.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.678
He was conducting
these experiments

02:59.680 --> 03:03.682
with neither the approval
nor the support of the CDC.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.584
When I learned
of his culpability,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.853
I immediately called
this press conference.

03:07.855 --> 03:12.057
I offer apologies to Syria for
the unforgiveable accusations...

03:12.059 --> 03:13.458
(quietly):
Are you kidding me?

03:13.460 --> 03:14.960
...and to the president...
What? Oh, my God.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.063
...and the American people
for the misinformation

03:18.065 --> 03:19.731
and the lies.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.500
Now that the American people
know the truth,

03:21.502 --> 03:24.203
I believe we are capable
of looking past

03:24.205 --> 03:26.605
the actions of
one rogue scientist...

03:26.607 --> 03:30.075
CANNERTS:<i> I must declare</i>
<i> the virus as highly contagious</i>

03:30.077 --> 03:33.312
<i> and fatal in 100%</i>
<i> of its victims.</i>

03:33.314 --> 03:34.746
LOMMERS:
<i> I recommend we institute</i>

03:34.748 --> 03:36.615
a cordon sanitaire to contain
the spread of the virus.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.283
LEX:
<i> What I need is the truth.</i>

03:38.285 --> 03:40.118
JAKE:<i> We are in the middle</i>

03:40.120 --> 03:42.621

03:59.506 --> 04:01.573

04:03.377 --> 04:05.577

04:09.750 --> 04:12.351
JAKE:<i> I mean, there has to be</i>
<i> something we can do.</i>

04:12.353 --> 04:14.219
You haven't set foot
out of that lab

04:14.221 --> 04:15.420
since Katie
coughed up blood.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.521
Hey, tell me.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.090
Come on,
just tell me.

04:18.092 --> 04:21.426
I've been working on isolating
Thomas's antibodies

04:21.428 --> 04:22.928
to create a passive
immunization.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.762
It's not a cure,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.831
but it may allow someone
to live longer.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.699
Yeah, so you need a human trial.
Sign her up.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.035
(sighs)
Without more time or resources,

04:30.037 --> 04:33.005
there could be a risk of
an ABO incompatibility reaction

04:33.007 --> 04:34.006
to the antibody serum.

04:34.008 --> 04:36.108
Her body could reject it.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.476
So?

04:37.478 --> 04:38.910
She's already dying.

04:38.912 --> 04:42.281
This particular Thomas strain
of the virus may be deadly,

04:42.283 --> 04:44.116
but it's kinder than
its predecessor.

04:44.118 --> 04:47.519
Patients remain asymptomatic
until past the 40th hour,

04:47.521 --> 04:49.821
death is delayed
beyond the 48th hour,

04:49.823 --> 04:53.225
and the body's ultimate
disintegration happens quickly,

04:53.227 --> 04:54.593
with precision.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.162
Still a terrible
outcome,

04:57.164 --> 04:59.064
but a shorter one.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.966
You're saying
it could make death worse.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.635
Significantly.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.341
Or it could save her.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.709
Do it.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.211
Cannerts is working
on the serum now.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.547
Did he eat enough today?

05:15.549 --> 05:18.583
Yeah, I got him to eat
half an MRE for breakfast.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.585
I'll make sure
he gets a good lunch.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.388
Do you think he understands
what's happening?

05:23.390 --> 05:25.390
He's being so strong.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.595
Yeah, I think he's being strong

05:30.597 --> 05:32.497
because he understands
exactly what's happening.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.966
I, on the other hand, am a mess.
(chuckles)

05:34.968 --> 05:37.436
But you're still here.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.204
For a guy who
likes to run,

05:39.206 --> 05:40.472
that's kind of a big deal.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.940
(chuckles)

05:41.942 --> 05:43.475
I won't run.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.577
THOMAS:
I'm special.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.012
I'll never run.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.613
I'm the only one
who can't get sick.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.449
QUENTIN:
Shut up, Thomas!

05:50.451 --> 05:51.616
She's only sick because of you!

05:51.618 --> 05:53.352
Whoa, hey.
Quentin...

05:53.354 --> 05:54.619
Quentin!

05:54.621 --> 05:56.054
I'll get him.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.423
Hey, buddy.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.509
(grunts softly)

06:20.080 --> 06:22.080
(groaning)

06:29.390 --> 06:30.856
(groaning)

06:40.868 --> 06:42.868
(grunting)

06:55.849 --> 06:56.882
Ow! Oh...

06:58.919 --> 07:00.752
Ow!

07:00.754 --> 07:02.187
(pants)

07:02.189 --> 07:03.188
Ow.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.823
See the press conference?

07:04.825 --> 07:09.060
She slithered right out of it
like the snake that she is.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.328
Print the damn story.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.530
It's too late, Lex.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.065
She turned all the evidence
we had against her

07:14.067 --> 07:15.867
into evidence against Cannerts.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.437
She got so far out ahead of our
story, we'll never catch her.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.305
Yeah, but we could
still take her down.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.406
LEO:
Not anymore.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.607
Besser just got promoted

07:22.609 --> 07:24.676
to Chief Operating Officer
of Atlanta,

07:24.678 --> 07:25.844
second to the mayor.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.479
Give you three guesses
who made that happen.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.747
What about the phone call?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.148
All right, we can still prove

07:30.150 --> 07:31.917
that Patient Zero
called her first.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.286
Yeah, I circled back
with my friend at the NSA.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.655
Burns's phone records
have been wiped clean.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.224
No, no, she won.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.859
We can't touch her.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.628
And I'm starting to think
it's better not to try.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.330
Are you kidding?

07:45.332 --> 07:46.631
What, you think this-this

07:46.633 --> 07:48.900
dog and pony show
is actually about Cannerts?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.869
Nah, Cannerts is
a warning shot, man.

07:50.871 --> 07:54.105
Lommers is tying up loose ends,
and we're next.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.774
You've done nothing
for the past two weeks

07:55.776 --> 07:57.175
but preach about
challenging the system

07:57.177 --> 07:58.276
and fighting for the truth!

07:58.278 --> 08:01.146
And you know what you've been
preaching back at me?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.031
Proof.

08:03.032 --> 08:04.915
If you're gonna shoot at
the king, you don't miss, right?

08:04.918 --> 08:07.586
Well, you know what we have?
Documents we obtained illegally,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.488
we've got computer files
we've hacked,

08:09.490 --> 08:10.755
the verbal confession of the man

08:10.757 --> 08:12.657
who's running
the city of Atlanta now,

08:12.659 --> 08:15.460
and we're up against a woman
who just threw the only doctor

08:15.462 --> 08:16.795
with a hope of finding a cure

08:16.797 --> 08:19.364
under a triple-decker bus!

08:19.366 --> 08:20.899
How do you think we'll fare?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.968
Now is not the time
to get cold feet.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.105
"Cold feet"?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.341
This is the Arctic, man.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.010
This is the first stop
on the Polar Express.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.346
I have dug myself
out of oblivion

08:34.348 --> 08:35.914
once already in my career.

08:35.916 --> 08:39.050
Credibility is
all that I have right now.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.153
If she takes that away from me,
I am not a journalist anymore,

08:42.155 --> 08:44.789
I'm just a loser
with a sad story.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.191
I'm out.
Leo...

08:46.193 --> 08:49.027
If you're smart,
you'll get out, too.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.629
Leo!

08:56.803 --> 08:58.937
CANNERTS:
<i> How could she do this to me?</i>

08:58.939 --> 09:00.906
MacINTYRE:
I am so sorry, Victor.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.275
I will make sure
that your name is cleared.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.044
It won't matter.

09:06.046 --> 09:10.682
Even if I'm only
a small part of the lie...

09:10.684 --> 09:12.884
this will follow me forever.

09:14.521 --> 09:18.690
My parents... do you think
they've seen the news?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.425
It's everywhere.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.993
They've seen it.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.094
(sighs)

09:23.096 --> 09:24.863
I'll call 'em after the...

09:26.300 --> 09:27.165
David?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.112
QUENTIN:
<i> It's not fair.</i>

09:41.114 --> 09:43.682
Why does Thomas get to be
healthy and you're not?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.450
This all happened
because of him.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.486
You want to play the blame game?

09:48.488 --> 09:49.955
All right, then.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.456
Blame me.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.624
But it's not your fault.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.858
Sure it is.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.193
I'm the one who took us

09:55.195 --> 09:57.062
on this field trip
in the first place.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.363
Remember?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.599
But you didn't know.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.834
Neither did Thomas.

10:02.836 --> 10:06.338
You can't blame him
any more than you can blame me.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.607
You're better than that.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.576
Thomas doesn't have
anybody left.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.178
If Dr. Cannerts can't fix me,

10:13.180 --> 10:15.880
you still have your grandma
and your grandpa

10:15.882 --> 10:18.016
and your cousins
and Aunt Sally,

10:18.018 --> 10:19.884
and maybe one day
your dad will get better

10:19.886 --> 10:21.720
and be the kind of dad
he should be.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.888
But Thomas
is all alone.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.958
Remember that the next time
you want to be mad at him.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.096
I'm sorry, Mom.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.201
I'm not the one who needs
the apology, kiddo.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.305
Now...

10:40.307 --> 10:43.642
go tell Dr. Cannerts
I'm ready for my treatment.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.317
Promise me you will get
him out of here alive.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.085
Hey, you're gonna be
right here to help me.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.453
Just promise!

10:55.455 --> 10:57.656
Please.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.726
I promise.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.773
(sobbing softly)

11:17.444 --> 11:18.910
(sniffles)

11:39.833 --> 11:41.966
Please be okay, Bert.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.836
Please.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.771
(panting)

11:55.315 --> 11:57.315
(grunts)

12:02.322 --> 12:05.056
(wincing)

12:09.096 --> 12:10.295
(grunts)

12:14.901 --> 12:17.102
(quiet chatter)

12:19.306 --> 12:20.305
Thank you.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.875
No bartering. Cash only.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.644
I need to speak to Trey.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.913
Lucky me.

12:28.915 --> 12:29.981
How can I be of assistance?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.149
Teresa and
Xander sent me

12:31.151 --> 12:32.784
for supplies.
Mm-hmm.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.652
Baby soap,
formula, diapers.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.855
Baby stuff's in the corner.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.657
Since what's mine
is technically hers,

12:39.659 --> 12:41.292
it'll be on discount.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.767
(knocking)

12:48.769 --> 12:50.502
(door opens)

12:50.504 --> 12:53.371
Here you go, man.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.609
We good?

12:57.611 --> 12:59.844
(door closes)

13:01.481 --> 13:03.314
Meese?

13:04.618 --> 13:07.018
Jana, hey.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.186
What are you doing here?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.821
Lex said that you were
on the outside with him

13:09.823 --> 13:11.289
and the rest of the guys.
Yeah, I was.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.924
But, um...

13:12.926 --> 13:14.659
I volunteered to help.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.027
Ended up getting stuck in here,

13:16.029 --> 13:18.797
so I turned it
into a business opportunity.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.565
Got any cash?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.367
Um, not really.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.202
Find some.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.370
Because for
5,000 a head,

13:25.372 --> 13:28.072
I can bust you
out of the Cordon.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.643
I got no evidence.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.278
No allies.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.980
Leo Green-- he's the one guy
to drag me into this,

13:35.982 --> 13:39.484
like a dog with a bone,
and now he's out.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.819
It makes no sense.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.687
Well, aren't you mad?

13:42.689 --> 13:44.689
Of course I'm mad!

13:44.691 --> 13:46.691
I fought the man and-and I lost.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.493
Like father, like son.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.331
Yeah.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.333
I got beat down.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.538
And you know the one thing
I regret more than anything?

14:00.540 --> 14:03.675
It was not
getting back up.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.443
Get up, son.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.613
And do what?

14:08.615 --> 14:11.916
I might know a guy.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.720
(sighs)

14:15.722 --> 14:18.323
(door opens)

14:18.325 --> 14:20.325
Hi, Katie.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.863
How you feeling?

14:24.865 --> 14:27.532
Like my muscles are
slowly turning to stone.

14:27.534 --> 14:31.069
I can give you some medication
for the pain if you'd like.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.305
No, um...

14:34.307 --> 14:36.808
I worked too hard to get
away from all that stuff.

14:36.810 --> 14:40.378
If there's a chance I can
make it through this clean,

14:40.380 --> 14:43.181
I'd like to try.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.019
Narcotics Anonymous
is a great program.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.422
I particularly
liked step four.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.826
Make a fearless moral
inventory of yourself.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.629
What do you suppose
you'd find, Dr. Cannerts?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.097
(clears throat)

15:04.905 --> 15:09.407
Courage and integrity.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.810
That's the moral code
my parents raised us under.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.379
This will pinch.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.650
Science runs in our blood.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.251
The whole family.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.889
After university in England,
my father

15:24.891 --> 15:27.892
arranged a position for me
to work with one of the premier

15:27.894 --> 15:29.227
researchers in the U.S.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.130
Dr. McIntyre took me
under his wing.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.566
He was more than a mentor.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.602
He was like a father to me.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.440
He reminded me
so much of my parents.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.277
Brilliant, fearless,

15:46.279 --> 15:48.112
honorable.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.686
17 days ago,
his wife Sabine called

15:54.688 --> 15:56.888
and asked me
to quarantine two doctors

15:56.890 --> 16:00.625
who'd accidently been exposed
to a new viral strain.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.395
When I said
Sayid Nassir's name

16:04.397 --> 16:06.965
as someone who may have
also been exposed, she...

16:06.967 --> 16:10.168
She told you to say
he was Patient Zero.

16:12.372 --> 16:17.008
The true Patient Zero
was Henry Burns,

16:17.010 --> 16:21.212
a researcher conducting
illegal viral testing.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.581
There was an accident,
he became infected,

16:23.583 --> 16:26.985
and passed it on to Dr. Sanders
here at the hospital.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.387
If our contact tracing
was correct,

16:29.389 --> 16:32.023
it would only have been 48 hours
until the danger passed.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.858
No one else would've died.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.994
You need to
confess this

16:35.996 --> 16:37.729
to someone who isn't
on their deathbed.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.267
I know I need to be held
accountable for what I've done.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.271
But I'm not
telling you the truth

16:47.273 --> 16:49.607
because I think
you're going to die, Katie.

16:51.144 --> 16:54.012
I'm telling you,
because more than anything

16:54.014 --> 16:57.515
in the world...

16:57.517 --> 16:59.517
I hope you live.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.093
Kind of surprised to hear

17:09.095 --> 17:11.362
the lieutenant governor
likes you.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.033
I didn't think anyone liked you.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.569
I paid him to like me.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.573
He was the lawyer
on my suspension hearing.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.043
He fought hard for me.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.911
He lost.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.414
He's still pissed about it.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.050
You think he'll help us?

17:32.052 --> 17:34.085
Well, when I knew him,
he liked to go to battle

17:34.087 --> 17:35.253
against the big guns.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.321
And he is one now.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.624
So I guess we'll see.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.496
(door opens)

18:10.757 --> 18:14.058
Is the medicine working?

18:14.060 --> 18:17.328
We won't know for
a little while.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.164
Do you think it will?

18:21.968 --> 18:23.568
I want it to.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.739
Do you have a mom?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.644
I did. She died.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.249
Was it awful?

18:41.454 --> 18:42.854
Yeah.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.655
Yeah, it was awful.

18:46.626 --> 18:50.661
And I tried to be strong,
but I-I kind of fell apart.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.697
I won't do that.

18:52.699 --> 18:53.998
You won't?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.666
Why not?

18:55.668 --> 18:58.503
Because I don't want to be
like that in front of her.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.338
I don't want her to worry.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.409
Yeah, I get that.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.545
I get that, but a
little bit of advice?

19:07.547 --> 19:10.381
You know, one
guy to another?

19:10.383 --> 19:14.552
She's gonna worry
no matter what you do.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.121
So I think she'll
want you to be like

19:17.123 --> 19:19.323
however you feel
like being, okay?

19:21.861 --> 19:23.661
(sighs)

19:26.399 --> 19:28.232
We're not supposed to touch.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.536
I know.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.876
(sighs)

19:47.954 --> 19:49.620
(Bert grunting)

19:52.892 --> 19:55.660
(groaning)

19:55.662 --> 19:57.061
You okay?

19:57.063 --> 19:59.463
Trying to be.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.601
It's taking me some time
to get home to my wife.

20:03.603 --> 20:07.538
Well, um, you might be waiting
on the bus for a while.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.807
(laughs)

20:09.809 --> 20:12.243
It's not too far.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.545
Just need to rest
for a minute.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.781
Not much in the way
of food or drink out here.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.886
Here.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.920
Keep it.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.090
I never put my mouth
on it, so it's clean.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.225
Promise.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.427
Thank you.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.469
Two days out
on these streets and...

20:38.471 --> 20:41.839
you're the first person
to even look at me,

20:41.841 --> 20:43.841
let alone help out.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.443
Well, yeah, I...

20:45.445 --> 20:47.979
I don't think anyone in
here is their best self.

20:47.981 --> 20:49.780
Including me.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.924
Here.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.727
There's some food
for you and your wife.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.463
And you can use the
cart as a walker,

21:05.465 --> 21:08.132
take some pressure
off your foot.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.134
Thank you.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.336
Truly.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.874
You're one of the good ones.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.609
(chuckles)

21:18.611 --> 21:20.811
Don't let this place
convince you otherwise.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.546
Same to you.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.289
(door opens)

21:31.291 --> 21:34.558
MAN:
Well, again, congrats.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.394
One more promotion,
maybe I need

21:36.396 --> 21:37.862
to start looking
over my shoulder.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.163
(both chuckle)

21:39.165 --> 21:40.298
All the best, really.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.334
(patting on back)

21:49.676 --> 21:52.543
I, uh, took the liberty
of canceling your appointment.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.111
You son of a bitch.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.048
BESSER: Easy now, Roy. I'm just
trying to protect Lex's future.

21:57.050 --> 21:58.282
He's got a bright one,

21:58.284 --> 22:00.985
if he can, uh, fall in line.

22:00.987 --> 22:01.919
You mean "sell out."

22:01.921 --> 22:05.623
That's the problem
with you Carnahan boys.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.860
You just don't know
when you're beat.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.495
(chuckles)

22:14.934 --> 22:16.934
(labored breathing)

22:33.820 --> 22:35.820
(groans)

22:47.900 --> 22:49.033
(groans)

22:51.971 --> 22:53.871
(gasping)

22:59.312 --> 23:02.046
(sobbing)

23:02.048 --> 23:03.914
Dr. Cannerts!

23:04.951 --> 23:06.684
Dr. Cannerts!

23:07.987 --> 23:09.253
Dr. Cannerts!

23:09.255 --> 23:11.789
Hey! Help me, please!

23:11.791 --> 23:14.258
Something's wrong!
Please help me!

23:14.260 --> 23:15.259
Hey!

23:15.261 --> 23:17.128
QUENTIN:
Mom!

23:17.130 --> 23:18.896
Quentin?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.264
KATIE: No!
(Quentin screams)

23:20.266 --> 23:21.265
No!

23:21.267 --> 23:22.867
No!

23:22.869 --> 23:24.869
(gasping)

23:40.353 --> 23:42.553
THOMAS:
Miss Katie?

23:44.690 --> 23:46.457
Thomas.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.295
Hi.

23:51.297 --> 23:54.298
They said
you wanted to talk.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.300
Uh, are you mad at me?

23:56.302 --> 23:57.501
No.

23:57.503 --> 24:00.037
I'm not mad at you, Thomas.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.572
Not even a little bit.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.508
No one is, not even Quentin.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.678
I didn't mean
to make Mary sick.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.681
Of course you didn't.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.983
You're a superhero, remember?

24:12.985 --> 24:17.521
Maybe I can give you some of
my special healing powers, too.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.257
(grunts)

24:20.259 --> 24:21.892
(gasps)

24:21.894 --> 24:23.694
Whoa.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.663
Do you think it worked?

24:25.665 --> 24:28.332
Yeah, I think it did.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.333
(laughs)

24:29.335 --> 24:31.469
(door beeps, opens)

24:31.471 --> 24:33.304
Hey, buddy, clear out.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.506
The lady and I have
a special date.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.176
Well, have fun, Miss Katie.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.012
Thank you, Thomas.

24:50.456 --> 24:51.989
What are you doing?
(chuckles)

24:51.991 --> 24:55.192
Get your blanket and lay it out
against the window.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.896
I raided pediatrics.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.931
Those kids really know
how to live it up down there.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.908
What is all that stuff?

25:10.910 --> 25:13.077
Finally having
that date we planned.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.079
Movie under the stars.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.783
Forget about him.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.252
It doesn't matter.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.487
Does matter.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.022
All my life, these people,

25:25.024 --> 25:27.057
they say "jump,"
they want you to jump.

25:27.059 --> 25:30.060
No questions, no
debate, just jump.

25:30.062 --> 25:35.132
Be a good boy, work the system,
you know, fall in line.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.934
It's all bull, Lex.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.870
You either suck up and rise
the ranks or you fight back,

25:39.872 --> 25:42.139
and then they give you the boot.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.808
And there ain't no pride
in any of that.

25:48.481 --> 25:50.748
We just can't win.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.484
It's not about winning, Pop.

25:53.486 --> 25:54.919
Never was.

25:54.921 --> 25:58.856
About the people inside
that didn't ask for any of this.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.897
You know, you've come
all this way

26:06.899 --> 26:10.034
without my chip
on your shoulder.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.036
Must have learned that
from your mother.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.572
Hey, know what
I learned from you?

26:14.574 --> 26:16.173
Never stop fighting.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.043
You get beat down,
you get straight back up.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.182
Gonna make a stop.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.483
Where?

26:26.485 --> 26:28.218
Leo Greene got me
into this mess.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.420
Makes no sense

26:29.422 --> 26:31.322
for him to bail so easy.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.324
Something must be up.

26:36.529 --> 26:38.996
That's beautiful.

26:40.833 --> 26:44.301
KATIE (reciting with movie):
Oh, he's okay, Maurice.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.837
There's his little foot...

26:46.839 --> 26:49.340
Oh, there's
the other one.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.642
(chuckles)

26:51.644 --> 26:53.544
You know all the words,
don't you?

26:53.546 --> 26:55.279
(chuckles)

26:55.281 --> 26:56.647
Quentin and I saw this

26:56.649 --> 27:00.384
42 times by the
time he was seven.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.355
(clears throat softly)

27:04.357 --> 27:06.357
Oh, look.

27:06.359 --> 27:08.225
What?
A shooting star.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.661
Romantic.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.196
There's Orion
over there

27:12.198 --> 27:16.634
under Orion's Belt or whatever
total mess you made of it.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.901
(scoffs)
That's not...

27:17.903 --> 27:19.436
that's not
Orion's Belt.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.072
That's... that's
<i> O'Brien's</i> Belt.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.173
Oh.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.075
Orion's lesser
known Irish cousin.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.177
(both laugh)

27:27.179 --> 27:29.313
(coughing)

27:38.758 --> 27:40.958
(breathes deeply)

27:40.960 --> 27:42.359
You okay?

27:42.361 --> 27:44.395
(inhales deeply)

27:44.397 --> 27:45.663
It's weird.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.666
That medicine.

27:48.668 --> 27:53.137
I feel better,
but not, you know?

27:55.074 --> 27:57.307
Listen.

27:58.544 --> 27:59.610
Just in case,

27:59.612 --> 28:01.845
there's something I want to say
before it gets bad.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.748
So you know I mean it.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.016
We are gonna have
our entire lives

28:06.018 --> 28:07.751
to say things
to each other, okay?

28:07.753 --> 28:09.687
Just listen.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.860
I love you.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.433
No.

28:22.435 --> 28:24.702
Yes.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.904
I love you, Jake Riley.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.241
(crying):
Don't say that.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.712
(sniffles)

28:40.119 --> 28:42.586
You don't get to say that...

28:42.588 --> 28:45.222
until I can hold you
when you do.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.292
(gasps, gags)

28:48.294 --> 28:49.293
Katie.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.461
(coughs, gags)

28:50.463 --> 28:51.462
Katie.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.298
(screaming)

28:55.201 --> 28:56.433
Katie.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.601
(breathes deeply)

28:57.603 --> 28:59.336
Katie.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.574
What happened?

29:03.576 --> 29:06.276
What happened? You just
kind of disappeared on me.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.011
You all right?

29:11.350 --> 29:13.617
Do me a favor
and go get Dr. Cannerts.

29:13.619 --> 29:17.287
Tell him I'm gonna take him up
on those pain meds after all.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.758
Okay.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.227
And bring me my son.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.229
I need to...

29:27.333 --> 29:30.534
I think it's time
to start saying good-bye.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.776
Mm-hmm.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.981
I'll be...
Okay, I'll be right back.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.124
(panting)

30:09.408 --> 30:11.141
SAM:<i> I'm not going on</i>
<i> another wild goose chase.</i>

30:11.143 --> 30:13.210
How do you know it's legit?

30:13.212 --> 30:14.945
This guy has got the one thing

30:14.947 --> 30:18.248
we were severely lacking
last time: an actual plan.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.085
I think we can finally
get out of here.

30:22.087 --> 30:23.287
Why aren't you
telling the others?

30:23.289 --> 30:25.756
Because I don't want
to get anyone's hopes up

30:25.758 --> 30:30.494
until I... know if this is
even a remote possibility.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.230
I mean, Teresa
and Xander are kids.

30:33.232 --> 30:36.200
On a good day, Suzy has about
$19 in her bank account.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.502
How much money do you have?

30:38.504 --> 30:43.574
If I can find a working ATM,
enough for half a person.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.665
This will cover the other half,
plus one more.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.067
How?

31:10.069 --> 31:11.468
Minute we got
locked in here,

31:11.470 --> 31:14.605
I started taking money out every
day until my account was empty.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.474
We have enough for two.

31:17.476 --> 31:21.211
And as much as I like to play
the hero from time to time,

31:21.213 --> 31:23.413
I'm not giving up my spot.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.284
You willing to leave
the others behind?

31:35.828 --> 31:37.294
Leo?

31:57.049 --> 31:58.615
(line ringing)

31:58.617 --> 31:59.816
(tones beep)

31:59.818 --> 32:01.585
WOMAN (recorded): We're sorry,
you have reached a number

32:01.587 --> 32:04.655
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.599
They're quite strong.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.801
They should ease the pain
considerably.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.136
(Katie sighs)

32:19.138 --> 32:22.773
I still need to talk to Quentin.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.474
(groans)

32:26.278 --> 32:28.478
I need to be able
to think clearly.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.649
Start with one.
Take it from there.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.286
Okay.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.523
Thank you.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.134
(sighs)

32:53.605 --> 32:56.506
I'm so sorry, Katie.

32:57.910 --> 33:00.243
No.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.245
You don't get to be sorry.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.014
You talk about courage
and integrity.

33:04.016 --> 33:07.117
Well, I'll tell you the same
thing I tell my 11-year-old son.

33:07.119 --> 33:10.387
Be brave and take responsibility
for your mistakes.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.990
You don't need me to
hold you accountable.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.291
Just fix this.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.259
You're the only hope
people in here have.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.661
(door beeps, opens)

33:24.970 --> 33:26.069
Jake, can you...?

33:26.071 --> 33:27.137
JAKE:
Yeah.

33:27.139 --> 33:30.173
Yeah, of course.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.286
Hi, sweet boy.

33:43.288 --> 33:46.089
Hi, Mom.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.724
You still scared?

33:47.726 --> 33:50.093
Yeah.

33:52.698 --> 33:56.500
You want to know what the
scariest moment of my life was?

33:59.838 --> 34:01.438
The day you were born.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.910
I held you in my arms,
and I was so terrified...

34:06.912 --> 34:08.278
(laughs)

34:08.280 --> 34:10.981
...I couldn't even move.

34:10.983 --> 34:13.817
So you know what I did?

34:13.819 --> 34:15.919
I moved anyway.

34:15.921 --> 34:18.055
And I kept moving.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.590
And the fear
eventually went away.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.596
Quentin...

34:28.801 --> 34:31.001
...being your mom

34:31.003 --> 34:34.438
has been
the greatest adventure

34:34.440 --> 34:36.640
anyone could
ever ask for.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.210
And I know you
feel like someone

34:40.212 --> 34:42.012
blew a hole up
in your heart,

34:42.014 --> 34:44.281
but you can fill it
with memories.

34:46.051 --> 34:47.517
Remember me happy.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.053
Can you do that?

34:50.055 --> 34:51.521
Yeah.

34:51.523 --> 34:52.522
Good.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.059
I need you to be brave.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.929
I need you to move

34:58.931 --> 34:59.996
and to keep moving.

34:59.998 --> 35:01.098
Can you do that?

35:01.100 --> 35:03.033
Yes.

35:03.035 --> 35:04.434
Good.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.970
Are you still scared?

35:06.972 --> 35:08.338
(crying):
Yes, Mom.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.040
I'm so scared.

35:10.042 --> 35:11.541
I'm not.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.843
You know why?

35:16.215 --> 35:19.449
Because you have made me
so proud.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.386
In the deepest part
of your heart,

35:23.388 --> 35:25.589
I know you're a good man.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.791
Like Jake?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.527
Yeah. Just like Jake.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.730
He's gonna need a friend in
here, so be good to him, okay?

35:37.035 --> 35:40.137
I love you, Mom.

35:40.139 --> 35:41.905
(sighs)

35:41.907 --> 35:43.907
I love you, too.

35:46.678 --> 35:51.515
Now what do we say
when we're home?

35:51.517 --> 35:54.284
There are no monsters
under the bed.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.786
No monsters in your head.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.222
Tomorrow brings
a new day of light.

35:59.224 --> 36:03.193
Sweet dreams, my prince.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.462
Good night.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.906
It's embarrassing.
Embarrassing?

36:15.908 --> 36:17.407
We indicted another country

36:17.409 --> 36:18.842
for a mistake that we made.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.311
It's immoral,
it's irresponsible,

36:21.313 --> 36:22.712
and worse than that,
it's racist.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.182
He's got to have other friends
who know where he is.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.616
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.985
Leo Greene is about
as popular as you are.

36:28.987 --> 36:29.986
(chuckles)

36:29.988 --> 36:31.388
You think someone took him?

36:31.390 --> 36:33.857
I don't think he ran.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.859
(knocking at door)

36:37.930 --> 36:39.930
Hey.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.064
I didn't order pizza.

36:41.066 --> 36:44.067
Are you Lex Carnahan?

36:44.069 --> 36:45.535
Yes, but I did not order...
Perfect.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.104
We got thick crust, works,

36:48.106 --> 36:49.673
prepaid by, uh,
Major Mouthpiece.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.741
Not sure that's
a real name.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.812
Thank you.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.286
What's going on?

37:05.224 --> 37:07.757
Leo Greene
is what's going on.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.795
(groaning quietly)

37:13.065 --> 37:15.565
Hey.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.900
(clears throat weakly)

37:16.902 --> 37:19.069
I was thinking
of going for a run.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.337
You want to come?

37:20.339 --> 37:23.106
(both laugh)

37:23.108 --> 37:27.377
You are so beautiful
when you smile.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.512
Promise me you'll smile
at least once a day

37:29.514 --> 37:32.716
