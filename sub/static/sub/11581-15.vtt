NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.271 --> 00:06.040
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.209
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.242 --> 00:10.211
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.244 --> 00:11.545
are members of an elite squad

00:11.579 --> 00:13.347
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.381 --> 00:16.084
These are their stories.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.387
I'm taking Rachel
to a dance audition,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.222
so you'll have
to pick Eli up
from soccer.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.823
Mm-hmm.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.359
The Westers asked
if we could come to
dinner Friday night.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.395
Sounds great, hon.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.630
And I'm going to run off
to Belize with the paperboy.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.831
Mm-hmm.
( clanging )

00:30.864 --> 00:32.100
What the hell was that?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.701
It's a miracle. He can hear.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.336
Damn homeless
make a mess

00:35.369 --> 00:37.638
with our garbage
and Sanitation fines me.

00:37.671 --> 00:38.639
Not this time!

00:38.672 --> 00:39.707
Sam...

00:41.809 --> 00:43.744
Who's there?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.413
Get out of there right now!

00:45.446 --> 00:48.082
Don't hurt me.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.455
Homeowner found him
eating out of the trash.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.524
The kid looks eight or nine.
Real skinny, no coat.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.425
What's his story?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.127
Won't talk.
Kid's pretty freaked out.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.128
Well, no wonder.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.596
You've got him locked up
in the back of your car.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.732
Just keeping him safe
for you kiddie cops.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.435
I figure he eats garbage,
he's abused.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.736
What do you think,
homeless or runaway?

01:08.769 --> 01:10.538
He looks pretty clean
for a street kid.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.739
Hey, buddy.
How are you doing?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.107
I'm Elliot.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.176
This is Olivia.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.510
What's your name?

01:17.178 --> 01:18.546
Look, you're not
in trouble.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.848
We just want
to talk with you.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.885
Please tell me
your name?

01:24.918 --> 01:25.886
Jacob Nesbit.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.889
Hey, Jacob.
You live around here?

01:28.922 --> 01:29.723
97th Street.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.393
97th Street? That's
just a block away.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.761
Who do you live with?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.296
My mom and my brother.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.165
Yeah? What about your dad?

01:37.198 --> 01:38.199
He's dead.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.837
Please don't tell
my mom I was eating.

UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

01:51.812 --> 01:54.748
and NBC

02:38.426 --> 02:39.827
You sure are hungry.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.962
I never had pancakes before.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.632
Your mom's never made
them for you?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.700
No. She says
they're against the rules.

02:46.734 --> 02:47.701
What rules?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.703
About food and stuff.

02:49.737 --> 02:54.942
What's good to eat, what's not,
how much food I can have...

02:54.975 --> 02:57.311
Your brother
have rules, too?

02:57.345 --> 02:59.947
Yeah.
But Adam never breaks them.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.717
Well, what happens
when you do break them?

03:03.751 --> 03:05.686
You get a punishment.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.255
What's the punishment?

03:09.923 --> 03:12.960
I don't want to talk about it.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.329
Jacob, I'm just trying
to help you out here,

03:15.363 --> 03:17.465
but I need for you
to trust me.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.868
My mom says what happens
at home stays at home.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.904
And what you and I talk
about in this room

03:23.937 --> 03:27.207
stays in this room.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
I can't tell you.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.746
It's against the rules.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.648
Can I finish my breakfast?

03:34.682 --> 03:38.586
Yeah, sure.

03:38.619 --> 03:42.823
We can't keep him here
unless there's some
allegation of abuse.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.024
He's scared
out of his wits.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.393
He doesn't want
his mother

03:45.426 --> 03:46.627
to know that he was eating.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.397
Something is going on here.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.899
All right.
Check her out.

03:51.932 --> 03:52.833
I'll call ACS

03:52.866 --> 03:55.869
and see if they
got anything
on the family.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.809
( knocking )

04:04.011 --> 04:04.978
Can I help you?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.515
I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.483
Let me get my mom.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.419
Please wait here.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.755
Kid's awful polite.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.425
Or just obeying
the rules.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.764
Hi, I'm-I'm Marilyn Nesbit.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.665
Is Jacob all right?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.934
Actually, we have him
down at our station.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.002
Can we come inside
and talk to you
for a sec?

04:29.036 --> 04:32.039
What about?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.006
Why you didn't
report your
son missing?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.509
He runs away and comes home
all the time.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.944
I wasn't really worried.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.446
Mrs. Nesbit,
we found your son

04:38.479 --> 04:41.515
eating chicken
out of a garbage can.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.851
We'd really like
to talk to you about it.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.422
I know my rights.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.857
I don't have to let you in.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.460
You bring my son home
or I'll call a lawyer.

04:53.761 --> 04:54.728
Cops tell me
that my kid

04:54.762 --> 04:57.465
is down at the station,
I'd be there right away.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.466
What's she so afraid of?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.467
I don't know,

04:59.500 --> 05:00.468
but he's not coming
back here

05:00.501 --> 05:01.502
until we get
some answers.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.071
BENSON:
Maybe she has some.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.007
Ma'am. Do you mind
if we have a word with you?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.942
Certainly.

05:10.578 --> 05:13.747
Marilyn Nesbit
is a lovely woman.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.783
She brings me homemade muffins

05:15.816 --> 05:19.086
and she sends her boys over
to help me do my chores.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.889
Did you ever notice any marks
or bruises on the boys?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.023
Oh, no.
They don't roughhouse.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.959
Jacob ran away. Have you heard
any yelling or fighting?

05:25.993 --> 05:29.129
He didn't run away.
He's just adventurous.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.999
He's a handful.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.868
I don't know how his mother
manages alone.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.970
When did the boy's father die?

05:37.004 --> 05:37.971
When Marilyn
was pregnant

05:38.005 --> 05:38.939
with Jacob.

05:38.972 --> 05:42.042
Went out for some milk,
walked into a store,

05:42.075 --> 05:43.777
walked right into a holdup.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.380
He was killed
by a 13-year-old boy.

05:46.414 --> 05:50.918
Now Marilyn stays home
with the children all day.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.553
Don't the boys go to school?

05:52.586 --> 05:53.821
Didn't she tell you?

05:53.854 --> 05:58.726
She homeschools Adam and Jacob.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.930
Marilyn Nesbit has
homeschooled her children

06:02.963 --> 06:05.399
for the past seven years.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.968
She took Adam out of public
school after second grade.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.970
Jacob's never
been enrolled.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.139
Anyone check on the boys?

06:12.172 --> 06:14.041
No one. The law requires
lesson plans,

06:14.074 --> 06:15.543
status reports
every semester.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.578
Marilyn's always
filed them on time.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.847
These lesson plans
look pretty detailed.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.482
They're downloaded
off the Internet

06:21.515 --> 06:23.050
from the New York
Homeschool League.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.685
So any parent
can yank their kid

06:24.718 --> 06:26.053
out of school
just by filing forms

06:26.086 --> 06:27.054
off a website?

06:27.087 --> 06:29.156
We're lucky we even have
any regulations at all.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.158
Some states
don't require parents

06:31.191 --> 06:32.993
to notify the school board.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.996
How many kids
are we talking about?

06:36.029 --> 06:38.031
Nationwide, the closest estimate
is one million.

06:38.065 --> 06:42.169
Sounds like you're
not a big fan of
homeschooling.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.671
I am when it works.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.439
But going to school
provides kids

06:45.473 --> 06:47.040
with more than an education.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.510
It's a safety net
that catches medical,

06:49.543 --> 06:51.178
psychological,
developmental problems,

06:51.211 --> 06:52.112
and child abuse.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.714
You think
that Marilyn Nesbit

06:53.747 --> 06:56.183
was using homeschooling
as a smoke screen for abuse?

06:56.216 --> 06:58.852
There are no red flags on file.

06:58.886 --> 07:03.190
Maybe you need to talk
to Adam's old school teachers.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.459
I taught Adam
in second grade.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.127
He was smart and sweet,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.229
but he had some
emotional issues.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.964
Like what?

07:10.998 --> 07:13.667
Lots of fears,
more than most seven-year-olds.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.236
It wasn't surprising
given his father's murder,

07:16.269 --> 07:18.171
but he really needed counseling.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.973
Didn't he get any counseling?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.141
Mom wouldn't consent.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.144
Said she could
help Adam herself.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.212
Fat chance.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.515
That woman was a fruitcake.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.982
How so?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.051
She had all these weird ideas
about food.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.720
Adam would come
to school hungry,

07:32.753 --> 07:34.855
but she wouldn't let him eat
school lunch.

07:34.888 --> 07:38.058
She claimed it was full of
pesticides and preservatives.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.662
So she packed nuts,
raw veggies, protein drinks.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.663
He eat that?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.498
Would any seven-year-old?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.465
( phone rings )

07:45.499 --> 07:47.535
Adam stole
other kids' food,
wolfed it down,

07:47.568 --> 07:49.637
then threw up
from eating too
much too fast.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.504
Stabler.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.740
Didn't you discuss this
with his mother?

07:52.773 --> 07:55.743
I kept making appointments,
but she never showed up.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.245
Finally I said if she wouldn't
meet with me,

07:58.278 --> 07:59.212
I'd report her for neglect.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.982
The next day,
she pulled Adam from school.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.919
It's Novak. She wants
to see us, now.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.788
Thank you.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.761
Are these the detectives
who've been harassing my client?

08:13.794 --> 08:16.664
Detectives Benson and Stabler,
meet Denise Brockmorton--

08:16.697 --> 08:19.132
legal counsel for the New York
Homeschool League.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.734
And attorney
for Marilyn Nesbit,

08:20.768 --> 08:22.135
whom you are persecuting

08:22.169 --> 08:24.271
solely because
she exercises her right

08:24.304 --> 08:26.940
to withdraw her children
from government schools.

08:26.974 --> 08:27.941
Nobody's being persecuted.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.643
We're just asking
a few questions.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.244
While you're holding
Jacob hostage.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.246
His mother wouldn't let us
in the door.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.615
We had to investigate.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.816
You mean go
on a witch hunt.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.217
The detectives
are merely trying

08:37.250 --> 08:39.052
to ensure that Jacob
is returned to a safe

08:39.086 --> 08:40.287
and healthy
home environment.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.689
Marilyn's a fine mother.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.557
The home is more than adequate.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.894
Prove it.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.629
Marilyn, I don't know
how you keep this place

08:48.662 --> 08:49.730
so neat with
two active boys.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.798
It's never been a problem.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.900
Where do the boys sleep?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.267
Right in here.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.705
STABLER:
Hey, Adam.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.706
Hello.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.307
What you working on, Adam?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.341
Trigonometry, ma'am.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.576
Excellent.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.777
Do you go online?

09:03.811 --> 09:05.312
Just educational sites.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.047
Do you got any hobbies?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.215
MARILYN:
Learning.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.818
That's their passion,
right, Adam?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.152
You mind showing us the kitchen?

09:12.185 --> 09:13.721
This way.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.824
What about exercise?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.592
Oh, we do morning
calisthenics.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.160
What, Sweating
to the Oldies?

09:20.193 --> 09:22.129
You have two
active kids here;

09:22.162 --> 09:23.163
that's not enough.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.332
The Homeschool League runs
a weekly athletic event

09:25.365 --> 09:27.835
in Central Park.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.903
Adam seems pretty small
for his age.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.071
I think he's
just perfect.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.941
STABLER:
So he gets enough
to eat?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.943
There's plenty of food.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.210
Healthy food.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.812
Why feed them
processed food

09:38.846 --> 09:41.281
that's full of chemicals
that cause cancer

09:41.314 --> 09:43.917
or beef that might have
that mad cow disease?

09:43.951 --> 09:45.886
Detectives, I think
that's enough.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.723
Unless a balanced diet
is a crime, we're done.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.358
Jacob's mother and her
mouthpiece want

09:51.391 --> 09:52.826
to take him home.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.027
We've got to let them.

09:54.061 --> 09:54.895
Who are you?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.363
Steve Krause,
social worker from ACS.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.798
We're not done investigating.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.700
Can't you put him
in a foster home
overnight?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.201
Not without a significant
statement

10:01.234 --> 10:02.770
about abuse from Jacob.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.238
Mr. Krause, you don't need
a statement. Turn around.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.641
That kid is terrified
of his mother.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.376
That's your interpretation.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.343
I spoke to Jacob.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.979
He told me
he wants to go home.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.413
Did he tell you
that he was hungry?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.848
Jacob's not malnourished.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.383
His mother uses
food to control him.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.719
A mother has a right
to her dietary beliefs,

10:18.752 --> 10:20.888
even the kids who'd rather eat
junk food,

10:20.921 --> 10:22.255
Just because she's different,

10:22.289 --> 10:24.391
doesn't mean that she's guilty
of abuse.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.292
Different.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.761
Sounds like
she's emotionally abusive.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.329
That's very hard to prove.

10:29.362 --> 10:33.033
Best I can do is recommend
family counseling.

10:33.066 --> 10:33.867
Is that it?

10:33.901 --> 10:36.870
I'll make a follow-up visit
tomorrow,

10:36.904 --> 10:39.339
but tonight,
Jacob has to go home.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.310
I don't like this.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.213
I'm telling you, that mother
is wound way too tight.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.685
This is my business card, okay?

10:51.719 --> 10:52.619
On the back
is my cell phone number.

10:52.652 --> 10:57.758
Call me anytime
if you need anything, okay?

10:57.791 --> 10:58.826
Thanks.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.838
Maybe we'll go out
and get some pancakes.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.305
If my mom says
it's okay.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.074
Let's go home.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.245
I'll see you
in the morning.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.246
What time?

11:19.279 --> 11:20.313
9:00 A.M.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.115
We'll be there.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.787
Dad! No cheating!
Who's cheating?

11:26.820 --> 11:29.122
Who are you calling
a cheater, huh?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.557
( growling )

11:30.590 --> 11:33.326
( laughing ):
Put me down, Dad.
( phone ringing )

11:33.360 --> 11:35.262
I'm going
to put you down.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.163
Kathy.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.466
Hey, why don't you go
get us some cookies?

11:39.499 --> 11:42.069
Hello?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.339
Jacob?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.308
Jacob, is that you?

11:48.341 --> 11:50.477
Is that the boy
from today?

11:50.510 --> 11:51.478
Yeah, I think so.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.747
Go.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.227
Mrs. Nesbit?

12:07.260 --> 12:08.762
It's Detective Stabler.

12:08.796 --> 12:09.797
Is anyone home?

12:29.850 --> 12:32.886
( sighs heavily )

12:37.991 --> 12:39.259
Single gunshot
to the temple.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.861
Stippling
around the wound.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.863
The gun was found
by Jacob's right hand.

12:42.896 --> 12:46.099
Suicide?
Not a chance in hell.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.801
The gun jammed
when someone tried

12:47.835 --> 12:49.102
to chamber the second round.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.804
Kind of tough to do that

12:50.838 --> 12:52.539
when you've already
shot yourself
in the head.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.041
When did this happen?

12:54.074 --> 12:55.542
M.E. says between
8:00 and 10:00 p.m.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.044
Jacob called me
at 9:07,

12:57.077 --> 12:58.545
so it happened
after that.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.047
Any word
from Marilyn or Adam?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.548
No. They're
in the wind.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.283
If Adam's not
already dead, too.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.886
Elliot, this
is not your fault.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.588
You didn't send
that boy home. ACS did.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.290
Screw ACS.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.292
I knew something was wrong.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.494
I watched that boy
walk out that door.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.600
Any idea where Marilyn Nesbit
might be headed?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.302
No friends, no
close relatives,

13:22.335 --> 13:23.603
no address book.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.305
Why kill one kid
and not the other?

13:25.338 --> 13:27.507
Abusive parents frequently
single out one child.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.909
Adam obeys her, Jacob doesn't.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.610
Maybe that's why
Adam gets enough to eat.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.312
Or maybe she did
try to kill Adam,

13:32.345 --> 13:33.847
but the gun jammed.

13:33.881 --> 13:34.848
So, what?
She's on the run,

13:34.882 --> 13:36.316
just dragging
this kid with her?

13:36.349 --> 13:37.851
Or maybe she's
already killed him,

13:37.885 --> 13:39.152
and she's out
dumping the body.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.988
What is her motive
for killing
her children?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.622
She destroys
the things she loves

13:42.655 --> 13:44.925
so that no one else
can take them from her.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.160
The archetype
is the Greek tragedy Medea.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.495
Medea. She
killed her kids

13:48.528 --> 13:49.863
to spite
their father.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.331
Yeah. Or, in this case,
to spite ACS.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.933
They were coming that morning.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.634
If Marilyn Nesbit
wouldn't have her children,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.003
no one would.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.871
I dumped the phones.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.606
Other than calls from
that shyster Brockmorton,

13:59.639 --> 14:01.341
Marilyn hasn't spoken
to anybody in days.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.443
And I got Marilyn's financials:
no income.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.046
She's been living off her
husband's life insurance.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.347
The money
is getting low.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.648
Any activity
on her credit cards?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.217
Still waiting
on the report.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.352
I got it flagged,
just in case she uses them.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.254
DMV's got a car
registered in her name.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.323
May not have to.
Well, get it out
on the teletype.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.258
That car comes standard
with Auto-Pilot.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.393
You know, you're lost,
you need directions,

14:20.427 --> 14:22.662
you push a button,
and it tells you
where to go.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.365
No kidding? How do
they track the car?

14:25.398 --> 14:27.200
Built-in GPS transponder.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.668
It sends out a signal.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.437
Thank God
for technology.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.505
Now we just got
to get Auto-Pilot

14:32.539 --> 14:34.041
to track Marilyn's car.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.576
Well, let's encourage them
with a court order.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.381
WOMAN:
Are you sure this is legal?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.683
BENSON:
Judge signed it.
You're in the clear.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.386
Give me the car's VIN number.

14:46.419 --> 14:52.059
2036613220.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.061
Got it. Right here.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.595
Car's not moving.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.931
Can you zoom
in on that?

14:57.965 --> 14:59.266
Sure.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.371
She's in the Bronx,
by the Westchester border.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.406
Cross streets
are East Drive
and River Road.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.574
Okay, can you call us

15:07.607 --> 15:09.242
if the car
starts moving again?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.078
Well, I can do better.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.946
Track her with this.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.948
I'll program in
her signal.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.722
Okay, turn right here.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.424
She hasn't moved yet.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.725
We're close.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.094
Westchester Mall.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.962
Great place to dump a car.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.964
Yeah. With a body
in the trunk.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.434
I don't see any blood.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.735
Empty.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.604
So where the hell
did they go?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.739
Maybe they came up here
to meet someone.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.741
Got no friends
or family.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.012
Only contact is with
that Homeschool League.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.446
That's it.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.747
John, it's Olivia.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.283
Call the Board
of Education.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.619
Find out if any other
homeschool families

15:52.652 --> 15:55.288
using the same curriculum
as Marilyn Nesbit

15:55.322 --> 15:58.458
live near Westchester Mall.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.994
Next house on the list
is Nancy Kester.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.762
Homeschools
her daughter Polly.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.464
How many we got left?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.166
Three more
after this.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.002
Can I help you?

16:09.036 --> 16:09.769
Yeah. Police.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.471
Do you know
a Marilyn Nesbit?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.772
Of course. Why?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.174
Have you talked
to her recently?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.143
Actually, I just
picked her up from the mall.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.477
She called me
when her car broke down.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.012
Do you know
where she is now?

16:19.046 --> 16:21.014
She's in the kitchen
baking cookies with the kids.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.149
What kids?

16:22.182 --> 16:23.483
Adam and my daughter.

16:23.516 --> 16:27.554
What's going on?

16:27.587 --> 16:28.621
Leave us alone.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.222
Marilyn,
just take it easy.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.557
Mom, who are these people?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.692
The police. Marilyn,
what happened?

16:32.725 --> 16:35.395
They want to take
my kids away from me!

16:35.428 --> 16:36.596
Step over here.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.398
Adam, I need you
to come with me.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.567
You can't take
my son! Go away!

16:40.600 --> 16:42.102
Let her go!

16:42.135 --> 16:43.436
Please come with me.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.737
I love you, Adam.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.274
Everything is going
to be fine.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.110
Don't say a word.
Be a man. Be a man.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.544
Marilyn Nesbit, you
are under arrest

16:51.578 --> 16:52.612
for the murder
of Jacob Nesbit.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.281
You have the right
to remain silent.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.183
Anything you say can and will be
used against you

16:56.216 --> 16:57.184
in a court of law.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.319
Why are
you doing this?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.656
My son is dead.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.629
Now you're
persecuting me.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.732
We're investigating a homicide.

17:12.765 --> 17:13.733
Kids play with guns.

17:13.766 --> 17:14.734
Accidents happen.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.469
And that boy
was murdered.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.737
You can't prove that.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.705
Sure, we can.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.608
Ballistics excludes
a self-inflicted injury.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.842
I'm sure they also told you

17:22.875 --> 17:24.511
my client's prints
weren't on the gun.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.712
Textured grip.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.647
They wouldn't be.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.649
What possible motive
did she have?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.651
Jacob called
Detective Stabler.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.121
He was about to open up
about his mom.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.723
I can't imagine
what he would
have told you.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.092
Marilyn has nothing to hide.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.294
Good. Where did she get the gun?

17:42.662 --> 17:45.698
I bought it for protection.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.671
Living alone in a house
with no man...

17:52.672 --> 17:54.641
I'm afraid.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.110
My client is aware
she broke the law

17:57.144 --> 17:58.811
by having an unlicensed handgun,

17:58.845 --> 18:00.713
and she'll take
full responsibility

18:00.747 --> 18:02.449
for her actions,
but she did not

18:02.482 --> 18:03.616
shoot her son.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.752
Then why did you run
when he got shot?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.754
How could you
just leave him there?

18:07.787 --> 18:10.257
I wasn't even there
when it happened.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.824
Where were you?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.193
At the store.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.228
When I came home, Jacob...

18:16.396 --> 18:20.700
was dead on the floor.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.271
Was Adam with you?

18:24.304 --> 18:28.675
No. He was home.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.377
Ask him.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.714
He was so frightened,
he could barely speak to me.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.551
Marilyn Nesbit was
at six different stores.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.719
Clerks remember her.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.388
She used a credit
card each time.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.556
Transactions cover the whole
range for time of death?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.559
Yeah. Some of the stores
even have her on videotape.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.861
So there's no way
that she shot Jacob?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.431
Liv, it could have
been an accident.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.900
How's my mom?

18:53.933 --> 18:55.335
She's fine.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.736
Can I see her?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.538
Not right now.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.706
Have a seat.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.741
She said that
we could talk with you.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.844
Adam, we know
that your mom wasn't home

19:04.877 --> 19:07.280
when your brother was shot.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.715
So now
it's up to you

19:08.748 --> 19:10.450
to tell us what
really happened.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.920
I don't want to talk about it.

19:13.953 --> 19:18.725
Your mom must have been
pretty mad when Jacob ran away.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.893
She still loved him.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.263
She loves me, too.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.399
Jacob told you
lies about mom.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.967
ACS was going
to take us away.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.669
That's not true.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.338
They just wanted
to check up on you guys.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.872
Make sure you and your brother
were safe.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.407
You're lying.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.509
They were going to put us

19:36.543 --> 19:38.511
in foster care.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.248
Do you know
what happens
to those kids?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.283
They get abused and molested.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.752
I can protect myself,
but Jacob can't.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.420
He's too little.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.457
But the gun would protect him.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.793
And that's why you
took your mom's gun--

19:53.826 --> 19:55.795
to protect
your brother.

19:58.531 --> 20:03.636
Adam, if it was an accident,

20:03.670 --> 20:06.773
then you're not going
to get in trouble,

20:06.806 --> 20:09.742
but you have to tell us
what happened.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.482
I took the gun from the closet.

20:15.515 --> 20:19.786
I told Jacob to shut his eyes,
and I shot him.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.355
He's in a better place.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.003
MAN:
Docket ending 0050
People v. Adam Nesbit.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.006
Murder in the 2nd Degree.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.941
JUDGE:
How does your
client plead?

20:41.974 --> 20:44.611
Not guilty, by reason
of mental disease or defect.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.613
Excuse me, ma'am,
but she's wrong.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.281
I did it. I'm guilty.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.416
Adam.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.451
JUDGE:
Miss Jameau, please
explain to your client

20:51.484 --> 20:54.354
that his statements
can be used against him.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.822
I shot my brother.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.291
I know I have
to go to jail.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.892
Your Honor, I ask that
Adam's remarks be stricken

20:59.926 --> 21:01.127
and a plea of not guilty
be entered.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.731
Your client just confessed to
murdering his brother again.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.899
Which shows that he is
clearly not competent

21:06.933 --> 21:07.900
to assist
in his own defense.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.936
The People will show Adam
knows right from wrong

21:09.969 --> 21:11.571
and should be allowed to enter
the plea of his choice.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.773
He's an emotionally
disturbed adolescent.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.074
He can't make that choice.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.075
JUDGE:
Enough.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.076
( gavel bangs )

21:17.109 --> 21:18.678
I'm ordering a 7:30 exam.

21:18.711 --> 21:22.715
Until the shrinks weigh in,
he's not guilty.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.755
So much bad stuff
happens to kids.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.090
They get kidnapped
and molested all the time.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.960
Oh. Is that why your
mom homeschools you?

21:33.993 --> 21:35.328
Yes.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.629
We learned so much

21:36.663 --> 21:39.065
and we don't have to be afraid
of getting hurt.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.033
Like at Columbine.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.870
Actually school shootings
are pretty rare, Adam.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.406
That's not
what my mom says.

21:46.439 --> 21:50.109
Plus, there's drugs
and gangs and bullies.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.112
What do you think?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.415
Same as my mom.

21:55.448 --> 21:58.918
Kids get hurt or killed
for no reason.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.754
Like your father?

22:01.788 --> 22:06.393
After he died, Mom wanted
to keep us safe,

22:06.426 --> 22:10.530
and we were...
till Jacob talked to the cops

22:10.563 --> 22:12.599
and the government
tried to take us away

22:12.632 --> 22:13.833
and put us in foster care.

22:13.866 --> 22:17.870
People were concerned about
what was going on in your home.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.907
Nothing was going on.

22:20.940 --> 22:25.011
Everything was fine until
Jacob messed it all up.

22:25.044 --> 22:28.415
So were you
mad at him?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.049
No.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.118
He's just a kid.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.387
He didn't know
what he was doing.

22:34.421 --> 22:38.425
Then why did you shoot him?

22:38.458 --> 22:42.995
To save him from something
horrible happening to him.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.999
Do you think killing
your brother was wrong?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.034
I broke God's law

22:48.067 --> 22:51.771
and I should be punished,
but I had to do it.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.807
Why did you
have to do it?

22:57.477 --> 22:59.446
Jacob is better off dead

22:59.479 --> 23:04.083
than being raped and abused
in some foster home.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.818
Adam's competent
to stand trial,

23:05.852 --> 23:08.488
but he's got some serious
emotional problems.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.856
Clinically he's paranoid.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.758
So Adam really did
kill Jacob to save him.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.693
Adam didn't think
he had any choice.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.663
It was the only
way to protect his
brother from harm.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.564
His mother
convinced him

23:17.597 --> 23:19.566
that danger lurks
around every corner

23:19.599 --> 23:21.568
and the only
safe place is home.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.470
You think Marilyn's
as guilty as Adam is?

23:23.503 --> 23:25.538
They convicted that
mom in Connecticut

23:25.572 --> 23:26.773
whose son hanged himself.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.041
She'd been told repeatedly
to get her son

23:29.075 --> 23:31.911
psychiatric treatment
long before his suicide.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.680
So was Marilyn.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.182
I think she's responsible
for Jacob's death.

23:36.215 --> 23:39.686
But Adam didn't commit suicide,
he killed his brother.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.688
He broke the law
and pled guilty.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.989
I can't ignore that.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.458
D.A.s cut deals with guilty
people all the time.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.426
What makes Adam any different?

23:50.497 --> 23:52.499
Thank you
for seeing me, Judge.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.233
Oh, Casey, stop
calling me Judge.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.202
I'm not on the
bench anymore.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.805
It's a habit from when
I used to clerk for you.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.974
And while we're having
drinks, call me Mary.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.209
What should I call you

24:03.242 --> 24:04.777
when I'm begging for advice?

24:04.811 --> 24:06.112
Brilliant.

24:06.145 --> 24:10.249
So, why did you go
into private practice?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.051
Three boys in college

24:12.084 --> 24:14.487
and an ex-husband whose
checks were always late.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.923
I could hardly get by
on a judge's salary.

24:16.956 --> 24:21.694
So, tell me about
the Nesbit case.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.230
Oh, the boy thought
he was doing the right thing

24:24.263 --> 24:25.598
when he shot his brother.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.600
He's willing to go
to jail for it.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.068
You don't know what to do.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.302
No.

24:30.336 --> 24:33.740
I don't think Adam Nesbit was
acting of his own volition.

24:33.773 --> 24:36.943
You mean you don't
want to indict him.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.612
I guess I don't.

24:39.646 --> 24:43.516
It's weird, I never
used to feel this way.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.284
It was simpler when
you did white collar.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.654
An executive embezzles,
the motive is greed,

24:47.687 --> 24:49.188
that's easy-- nail his ass.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.559
SVU cases aren't
nearly as clear.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.827
And this kid, he's like
a ventriloquist dummy.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.029
Whatever mom says, he says.

24:57.063 --> 25:00.299
Oh. So, mom's to blame.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.202
Are parent's responsible
for their children's actions?

25:03.235 --> 25:04.303
That's the question.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.739
I don't have the answer.

25:06.773 --> 25:07.740
Find it.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.008
And while
you're at it,

25:09.041 --> 25:11.277
figure out how you feel.

25:11.310 --> 25:14.781
Do you feel this boy
deserves to be charged?

25:14.814 --> 25:18.785
Do you feel the facts fit
the charge under the penal law?

25:18.818 --> 25:20.119
Did the boy have intent?

25:20.152 --> 25:22.855
I don't know what
he was thinking.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.591
Well, find out.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.825
And find out why
your defendant

25:25.858 --> 25:27.660
isn't rebelling
against his mother,

25:27.694 --> 25:29.862
like a normal teenage boy.

25:36.603 --> 25:37.704
Adam was always serious.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.572
A little intense
but very gentle.

25:39.606 --> 25:40.907
Certainly not violent.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.776
Did Adam ever talk to you
about his mother?

25:43.810 --> 25:44.977
Not really.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.145
Mom, can I go?

25:46.178 --> 25:48.581
I really need to
review my French.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.950
All the verbs
in section six.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.985
I'll drill you later.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.924
Polly is very confused
by what's happened.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.626
She's known Adam for years.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.260
Were they close?

26:01.293 --> 26:03.295
Well, she had
a crush on him.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.297
Marilyn noticed, didn't approve.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.099
They stopped visiting us
after that.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.669
Actually, I was surprised
when she called from the mall.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.203
She didn't want Adam
to have a girlfriend.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.673
She didn't want Adam
to have any friends.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.075
She kept those boys a little
close for my comfort.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.309
Made me wonder.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.145
About abuse?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.614
Nothing sexual.

26:21.648 --> 26:25.151
I just wondered if homeschooling
was healthy for her kids.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.152
Why?

26:26.185 --> 26:27.620
Well, some families
homeschool

26:27.654 --> 26:28.755
for religious reasons.

26:28.788 --> 26:32.324
Others, like us, we can't afford
private school tuition,

26:32.358 --> 26:35.728
but we don't like the chaotic,
overcrowded public schools.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.396
And Marilyn?

26:37.429 --> 26:41.400
She wanted to control
those boys completely.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.004
Maybe it was her way
of keeping them safe.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.209
Miss Novak!

26:50.242 --> 26:51.778
Yeah?

26:51.811 --> 26:54.714
I... think I'd better
give you these.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.388
"My mom keeps telling me
stuff that scares me.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.991
I want to run away,
but I can't leave Jacob."

27:05.024 --> 27:06.225
Those are my e-mails.

27:06.258 --> 27:07.827
Where did you get those?

27:07.860 --> 27:11.397
Polly Kester gave them to us.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.431
You can't tell my mom.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.033
I'm not supposed to do that.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.168
Miss Novak won't
tell your mom.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.970
She just wants to help you.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.205
It's none of her business.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.908
"Polly, do you think
there are things so bad,

27:21.941 --> 27:23.309
you'd be better off dead

27:23.342 --> 27:25.077
Stop!
than living through them?"

27:25.111 --> 27:26.145
Please, stop!

27:26.178 --> 27:27.947
"Polly, why haven't
you answered me?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.282
"My mom wants me
to do something.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.251
I don't know what to do."

27:32.284 --> 27:34.086
Adam, you wrote that
the night Jacob died.

27:34.120 --> 27:34.954
Make her go away.

27:34.987 --> 27:40.993
Adam, you have to
tell us what happened.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.162
What did your mom
want you to do?

27:43.195 --> 27:45.164
No, I won't talk about it.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.933
You wanted Polly
Nester's help.
It's too late!

27:46.966 --> 27:48.100
It's not.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.002
Yes, it is.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.972
I'm not supposed to be here.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.874
I should be dead.

27:59.511 --> 28:04.283
You shot Jacob, and you
tried to kill yourself...

28:04.316 --> 28:06.819
but the gun jammed.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.320
( sobbing quietly )

28:08.354 --> 28:09.722
( sniffles )

28:15.327 --> 28:17.797
That bitch is responsible,
but I can't touch her.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.332
The e-mails don't implicate
Marilyn in Jacob's death.

28:20.366 --> 28:24.270
She put crazy ideas in his head
that made him kill his brother.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.172
Yeah, but it's tough
to prosecute a parent

28:26.205 --> 28:28.340
for giving their kid warped
views on the world.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.575
Even if it cripples them.

28:29.608 --> 28:33.813
Bringing up Adam with paranoid
ideas isn't against the law.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.481
I mean you can raise
your kid to be a racist

28:35.514 --> 28:36.949
so long as
it doesn't cause harm.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.885
Well, there's your
difference right there.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.419
This is like vehicular homicide.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.756
Adam is the car, Marilyn
is behind that wheel.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.524
Her paranoia drove his actions.

28:45.557 --> 28:50.763
Can you charge Marilyn
with causing Jacob's murder?

28:50.797 --> 28:53.165
Her gun, her fears, her beliefs.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.768
I could argue Marilyn
facilitated the murder,

28:55.802 --> 28:57.536
but legally it's a long shot.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.772
So we've got
nothing to lose.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.777
If you have more questions,
call my attorney.

29:04.811 --> 29:05.945
Make an appointment.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.047
Call her yourself.
Have her meet you
down in arraignment.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.548
What is this?

29:09.581 --> 29:12.018
Marilyn Nesbit, you're under
arrest for criminal facilitation

29:12.051 --> 29:13.219
in the murder
of Jacob Nesbit.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.553
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.389
Anything you say can
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.891
You have the right
to an attorney...

29:23.395 --> 29:25.031
Who are you?

29:25.064 --> 29:26.833
I'm George Huang.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.068
I'm a psychiatrist.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.236
I evaluated Adam.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.503
Huh.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.840
You think he's crazy?

29:33.873 --> 29:35.574
Not crazy.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.845
Fearful.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.847
He's smart.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.549
He knows the danger
in this world.

29:43.582 --> 29:47.186
Because you taught
them to him.

29:47.219 --> 29:51.891
Look, I grew up without a home.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.493
No mother, no safety.

29:54.526 --> 29:59.165
I don't sugarcoat the truth.

29:59.198 --> 30:02.601
How did Jacob respond
to the truth?

30:02.634 --> 30:05.838
He thought I was
being unfair.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.207
But life isn't fair, is it?

30:08.240 --> 30:12.845
If it was, my husband would be
alive, my son would be alive.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.847
None of this would
have happened

30:14.881 --> 30:16.983
if Jacob had
listened to me.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.251
How did Jacob
disobey you?

30:19.285 --> 30:24.356
He would never accept
that I was right.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.292
Always right?

30:26.325 --> 30:28.995
About what was
right for him.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.629
I am his mother.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.533
Well, sometimes
even good parents make mistakes.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.036
Do you have any children?

30:37.069 --> 30:38.470
No, I don't.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.472
I didn't think so.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.942
You see, for me, you're
just a short little man

30:42.975 --> 30:44.310
with a nasty little mind.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.245
You're trying to
twist my words

30:46.278 --> 30:48.514
and get me
to say things.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.917
Think I'm stupid?

30:50.950 --> 30:53.052
And you're right, I am,

30:53.085 --> 30:56.655
for sitting here
and listening to you.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.559
Now, will you please
call my lawyer?

31:03.595 --> 31:06.398
What the hell was that?

31:07.699 --> 31:10.036
Marilyn's response to stress.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.206
How can she be
reading the paper

31:14.240 --> 31:15.607
as if nothing happened.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.544
Because she has a borderline
personality disorder.

31:18.577 --> 31:21.380
She compartmentalizes
the world.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.515
She's always right,
and anyone who challenges her

31:23.549 --> 31:24.984
is not only wrong
but her enemy.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.318
Including her children?

31:26.352 --> 31:27.219
Absolutely.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.521
Adam always obeyed her
and so he was good.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.490
Jacob didn't,
so that made him bad.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.292
So she doesn't
really love them.

31:33.325 --> 31:36.028
It's a twisted,
narcissistic kind of love.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.430
As soon as her kids show
any individuality,

31:38.464 --> 31:41.100
she perceives it as
rejection and an attack.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.534
What made her this way?

31:42.568 --> 31:44.971
Inadequate attachment
to her own mother,

31:45.004 --> 31:46.973
maybe she was abused herself.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.708
But her husband's murder
unleashed her paranoia.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.678
He gets killed,
so the outside
world's dangerous.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.014
Adam's teacher challenges
her parenting,

31:55.047 --> 31:56.515
so school's a bad place.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.985
Can you sell it to a jury?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.953
Let's see if a judge
buys it first.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.722
This is ludicrous,
Your Honor.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.092
My client in no
way facilitated
her son's murder.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.493
Adam Nesbit shot his brother

32:07.526 --> 32:09.996
because their mother told him
they'd be better off dead

32:10.029 --> 32:10.929
than in foster care.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.464
After making these
inflammatory comments,

32:12.498 --> 32:13.966
she left her
frightened children

32:14.000 --> 32:15.401
home alone with a loaded gun.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.536
What did she think
was going to happen?

32:17.569 --> 32:18.670
So your psychic now?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.039
You can read my client's mind?

32:20.072 --> 32:21.040
All I had to read

32:21.073 --> 32:22.208
were Adam's e-mails.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.276
"My mom wants me
to do something."

32:24.310 --> 32:27.013
But you had no idea what
Adam Nesbit meant by that.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.214
No, but Marilyn Nesbit

32:28.247 --> 32:29.481
made sure that Adam thinks

32:29.515 --> 32:31.050
only what she wants
him to think.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.352
Can't you see what's
going on here, Your Honor?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.087
The People are
persecuting my client

32:35.121 --> 32:37.289
because the government
doesn't approve

32:37.323 --> 32:38.757
of her choice
to homeschool.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.693
So this is a politically
motivated witch-hunt?

32:41.727 --> 32:43.529
If Adam went
to a government school

32:43.562 --> 32:45.297
and shot a fellow student there,

32:45.331 --> 32:47.399
would Ms. Novak be
charging his mother?

32:47.433 --> 32:50.602
The facilitation charge
is legally sufficient.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.472
We'll see what
the grand jury has to say.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.475
Cross one-90-50 notice.

32:56.508 --> 33:00.079
My client will testify
at the grand jury,

33:00.112 --> 33:03.749
and I'm sure they will find
a bereaved mother

33:03.782 --> 33:06.052
very sympathetic.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.159
Regarding last Tuesday,
Mrs. Nesbit,

33:13.192 --> 33:14.626
you've stated
you had no idea

33:14.660 --> 33:17.563
what Adam was planning to do
when you left the apartment

33:17.596 --> 33:18.797
the night of Jacob's death?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.666
Yes, ma'am.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.069
And where did you go?

33:23.102 --> 33:26.105
The grocery store...

33:26.138 --> 33:32.211
the pharmacy and, um,
a couple of other shops.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.579
The prescription you picked up

33:33.612 --> 33:35.547
wasn't due
to be refilled for another week.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.183
Mm-hmm.

33:37.216 --> 33:40.686
Jacob, uh... had
some stomach problems.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.090
I always like to have
a full supply

33:44.123 --> 33:46.725
of his medication on hand.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.228
Or perhaps you wanted
an airtight alibi.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.262
I'm just careful

33:50.296 --> 33:51.830
about my son's health.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.100
You were careful to stand

33:54.133 --> 33:56.068
underneath the video cameras

33:56.102 --> 33:59.438
and to pay with a credit card
for a five-dollar purchase.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.207
I know how you people work.

34:01.240 --> 34:05.177
If I had paid with cash and had
no record of buying his pills,

34:05.211 --> 34:07.713
you'd be charging me
with medical neglect.

34:07.746 --> 34:08.747
So everyone's

34:08.780 --> 34:10.749
out to get you, Mrs. Nesbit?

34:10.782 --> 34:11.850
I never said that.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.220
But it's clear,

34:14.253 --> 34:19.525
you don't approve of how
I'm raising my sons.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.527
We're here today

34:21.560 --> 34:24.163
in a matter of your son--
Jacob's death.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.564
Nothing more.

34:28.200 --> 34:32.171
You're trying to take my
children away from me.

34:32.204 --> 34:35.207
I know how you people are.

34:35.241 --> 34:40.246
Police, district attorneys,
DYFS...

34:43.515 --> 34:46.152
you destroy families!

34:49.888 --> 34:54.393
Be careful.

34:54.426 --> 34:59.165
If you don't live
your lives by their rules,

34:59.198 --> 35:01.167
they'll come after
your kids too.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.640
I got your 911.
What's the emergency?

35:08.674 --> 35:10.276
When Marilyn
was testifying,

35:10.309 --> 35:12.444
she was talking
about social services

35:12.478 --> 35:13.445
taking her kids away.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.248
But she didn't call them ACS;
she said DYFS.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.750
Division of Youth and Family
Services in New Jersey.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.687
Why is a New Yorker calling
ACS by an out-of-state name?

35:21.720 --> 35:22.821
Stall the grand jury.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.290
Let's take a road trip.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.364
There's no record
of a Marilyn Nesbit
in our system.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.266
Nothing on Adam
or Jacob Nesbit either.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.834
Maybe she used
a different name.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.636
Is there any other way
that you can check?

35:37.669 --> 35:38.937
You've got D.O.B.s
on the family?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.506
Right here.

35:40.539 --> 35:44.810
All right, let me try first
names and birth dates.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.348
Here's something.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.350
A Marilyn Chesterfield.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.785
Same D.O.B., with a son Adam,

35:53.819 --> 35:55.221
but no Jacob.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.323
What's the allegation?

35:57.356 --> 35:58.557
Happened back in 1995,

35:58.590 --> 36:00.192
so it's archived here.

36:00.226 --> 36:01.327
Give me a minute.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.328
It's got to be her.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.263
Adam was six, Jacob wouldn't
have been born yet.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.964
Okay, so why's Marilyn
using a different name?

36:05.997 --> 36:06.932
Here it is.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.901
Child came to school
with welts and bruises.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.537
States his mother beat him.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.972
Child afraid to go home.
Placement requested.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.407
She beat Adam.

36:15.441 --> 36:17.809
No, the child's name is Daniel.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.346
Who the hell is Daniel?

36:20.379 --> 36:21.413
An older son.

36:21.447 --> 36:25.351
Here, the narrative says
that the mother went back

36:25.384 --> 36:28.254
to her maiden name,
but her married name

36:28.287 --> 36:30.556
was Marilyn Chesterfield Nesbit.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.328
Mom was always a little crazy,
you know?

36:36.362 --> 36:37.363
With weird diets and stuff,

36:37.396 --> 36:39.831
but Dad kept her from going
off the deep end.

36:39.865 --> 36:43.802
When he got killed,
she just lost it.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.737
How old were you?

36:45.771 --> 36:46.772
Thirteen.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.840
Adam was, uh, six.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.278
Mom was pregnant with Jacob.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.346
I mean, she was pretty paranoid,
you know?

36:54.380 --> 36:55.981
She moved us out here to Jersey.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.816
She changed our name
to Chesterfield.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.485
She said that they would kill us

36:59.518 --> 37:01.287
if we stayed
in the city.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.389
How did you wind up
in foster care?

37:03.422 --> 37:06.224
When my dad got murdered...

37:07.926 --> 37:13.965
He went to that store because
I wanted milk for my cereal.

37:13.999 --> 37:18.304
My mother blamed me
for his death,

37:18.337 --> 37:20.306
so she started
beating the crap out of me.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.941
Finally, I couldn't take it
anymore and I told my teachers,

37:22.974 --> 37:25.611
and they said
that she'd get help

37:25.644 --> 37:27.713
and then I could go home.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.948
But you didn't?

37:29.981 --> 37:33.285
My mother never showed up
for family court.

37:33.319 --> 37:34.620
She disappeared.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.388
They couldn't find her.

37:36.422 --> 37:39.458
So I stayed in the system
until I was 18.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.059
Then I joined the Navy.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.862
I got out last year.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.831
You ever try
to contact your mother?

37:45.864 --> 37:46.932
I thought about it.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.801
I was mad at her
for a long time.

37:49.835 --> 37:53.939
But things got better
once I was away from her.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.574
Um, nobody hit me.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.075
My foster parents
are good people.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.610
And I thought

37:58.644 --> 38:00.546
I was just better off.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.980
What about Adam?

38:02.013 --> 38:03.649
She never hit him.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.418
I thought he would be fine.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.519
I...

38:10.889 --> 38:14.092
( voice breaking ):
I should have gone back.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.727
I could've stopped it.

38:15.761 --> 38:18.564
You didn't know.

38:18.597 --> 38:23.402
I left him there with her.

38:24.903 --> 38:28.039
Look, he needs you now.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.851
You're wasting
your time.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.421
I won't talk
about my mom.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.890
All you have
to do is listen.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.925
Hello, Adam.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.901
Who are you?

38:55.934 --> 38:58.537
I'm your brother.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.639
You can't be.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.941
Daniel's dead.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.510
He got killed in foster care.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.544
Mom told me all about it.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.945
She lied to you, Adam.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.147
She wouldn't do that!

39:09.180 --> 39:10.849
She loves me!

39:10.882 --> 39:13.419
I never stopped
thinking about you, Adam.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.020
I've always kept this.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.154
Remember?

39:16.187 --> 39:19.491
Remember, I taught you
how to ride a bike.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.692
You were so afraid

39:20.726 --> 39:23.962
you were going to fall...

39:23.995 --> 39:27.098
but I wouldn't let you.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.903
She lied about you.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.642
She lied about everything.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.818
She lied about the night
Jacob died, didn't she?

39:50.956 --> 39:53.592
Tell me what happened.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.535
When Mom brought
Jacob home,

40:03.569 --> 40:06.805
after he ran away,
she was so mad.

40:06.838 --> 40:10.442
She kept yelling that
we were going to foster care

40:10.476 --> 40:12.778
and that we were
going to be raped

40:12.811 --> 40:15.581
and beaten to death,
just like Daniel.

40:18.984 --> 40:23.955
She said if I was really brave,
I could stop it from happening.

40:25.924 --> 40:30.562
She went to her room
and came back with the gun.

40:30.596 --> 40:33.565
She said it was up to me.

40:33.599 --> 40:36.034
She said
that we wouldn't suffer

40:36.067 --> 40:38.904
and that we'd be
together in heaven.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.439
Dad and Daniel...

40:44.109 --> 40:46.478
I believed her...

40:52.618 --> 40:55.521
and I shot him.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.626
Oh, my God.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.862
What have I done?

41:03.895 --> 41:07.098
What did I...?

41:23.314 --> 41:25.283
Ms. Novak. You could have sent
the indictment to my office.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.685
Adam.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.621
Why did you tell me
all those lies, Mom?

41:29.655 --> 41:31.523
Why did you tell me

41:31.557 --> 41:34.159
to shoot Jacob?

41:34.192 --> 41:37.596
What have you done to my son?

41:37.629 --> 41:40.298
They told him the truth.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.033
Hello, Mom.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.269
ATTORNEY:
What the hell is
going on here?

41:44.302 --> 41:46.605
Ask your client.

41:46.638 --> 41:47.806
Marilyn?

41:47.839 --> 41:49.307
Who is this?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.577
It's a trick.

41:51.610 --> 41:53.612
It's her son, Daniel.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.747
Daniel's dead.

41:55.781 --> 41:58.016
Thanks to you,
my whole family is gone.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.017
And you're next.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.318
You'll never be safe.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.554
They'll kill you,

42:02.588 --> 42:05.156
like they killed your father.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.324
Don't listen to them.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.293
Adam, I'm your mother!

42:08.326 --> 42:10.228
I'm the only one
you can trust!
