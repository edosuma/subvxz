<b>What the hell are you doing here?</b>

11:10.440 --> 11:12.360
<b>Ah, no, I'm just…</b>

11:12.400 --> 11:13.440
<b>I see!</b>

11:13.820 --> 11:17.320
<b>So you're that brat they were talking about.</b>

11:18.370 --> 11:20.620
<b>It's not me though.</b>

<b><i></i></b>Shinra Private Institute

11:23.790 --> 11:26.960
<b>What's with your face, Manta?</b>

11:27.460 --> 11:30.170
<b>We told you to stay away 
from that graveyard, didn't we?</b>

11:30.540 --> 11:32.300
<b>So what the hell happened?</b>

11:32.550 --> 11:34.970
<b>Going on about ghosts and stuff all of a sudden!</b>

11:35.010 --> 11:36.300
<b>Now look at you!</b>

11:38.050 --> 11:39.970
<b>Ghosts do exist.</b>

11:40.550 --> 11:41.560
<b>Transfer student.</b>

11:41.930 --> 11:44.120
<b>I heard what happened 
from my graveyard friends</b>

11:45.350 --> 11:47.520
<b>What "graveyard friends" are you talking about?</b>

11:47.520 --> 11:49.190
<b>Just leave us alone, would you?</b>

11:50.150 --> 11:52.400
<b>Your name is Manta right?</b>

11:54.530 --> 11:56.820
<b>Alright, time for us to get some payback, Manta.</b>

11:56.860 --> 11:58.450
<b>Wait a second!</b>

11:58.820 --> 12:00.950
<b>No one even asked you for your help!</b>

12:00.990 --> 12:03.950
<b>What makes you think this is any of your business anyway?</b>

12:04.660 --> 12:07.000
<b>It's only natural to help your friends, right?</b>

12:08.290 --> 12:09.630
<b>My grandpa used to tell it me all the time.</b>

12:10.000 --> 12:13.710
<b>Anyone who can see spirits on their own can't be a bad person.</b>

12:14.250 --> 12:18.840
<b>That's why I told you my secret that night.</b>

12:19.510 --> 12:20.800
<b>Because we're friends.</b>

12:20.800 --> 12:21.720
<b>Sound good?</b>

12:21.760 --> 12:22.890
<b>That doesn't sound good!</b>

12:22.930 --> 12:24.520
<b>That doesn't sound good at all!</b>

<b>Who would become friends with a slipshod like you?</b>

<b>You know how terrifying those guys are right?</b>

12:30.940 --> 12:35.470
<b>Wooden Sword Ryuu is a dangerous guy! Only an idiot would pick a fight with him!</b>

<b>You can't win against him with your small body!</b>

<b>Well, it's true that I'm weak.</b>

12:42.830 --> 12:44.120
<b>Then just give up!</b>

12:44.160 --> 12:46.000
<b>But we'll figure something out.</b>

12:46.950 --> 12:51.290
<b>It'll be fine, we've got some strong allies on our side too.</b>

13:02.640 --> 13:04.600
<b>Huh? The hell did you just say?</b>

13:05.010 --> 13:06.640
<b>You guys need to leave.</b>

13:06.680 --> 13:09.180
<b>You want us to kill you and send you to the other world, huh?</b>

13:09.770 --> 13:14.290
<b>Speaking of the other world, my friends from there are telling me you're a nuisance.</b>

13:15.940 --> 13:19.700
<b>Idiot! Ryuu can't be scared of ghosts!</b>

13:19.740 --> 13:21.910
<b>All right. If you can beat me.</b>

13:21.950 --> 13:23.450
<b>"Come and beat me", right?</b>

13:23.910 --> 13:24.700
<b>Huh?</b>

13:25.160 --> 13:28.870
<b>Trust me, there's someone who wants to fight so much he can't hold himself any longer.</b>

13:29.370 --> 13:30.250
<b>Isn't that right?</b>

13:34.460 --> 13:35.290
<b>Amidamaru!</b>

13:35.750 --> 13:37.630
<b>It's the spirit of a samurai!</b>

13:38.090 --> 13:42.340
<b>I am humbled by this opportunity</b>

<b>to dispel the humiliation that has been brought upon me, Master Yoh!</b>

13:45.720 --> 13:50.270
<b>Don't tell me this spirit is the one whose gravestone was desecrated!{OH SHIT!}</b>

13:50.850 --> 13:53.850
<b>Amidamaru, the legendary samurai!</b>

13:54.290 --> 13:56.020
<b>Hey, hey, hey.</b>

13:56.020 --> 13:58.530
<b>We've got another idiot talking about Amidamaru to piss me off?</b>

13:58.530 --> 14:01.490
<b>I knew it, spirits really do exist!</b>

14:02.200 --> 14:05.280
<b>Guys, kill them!</b>

14:05.820 --> 14:08.840
<b>Well then, let's show them.</b>

14:08.950 --> 14:10.540
<b>Amidamaru.</b>

14:11.330 --> 14:13.750
<b>If you and I combine our skills,</b>

14:14.330 --> 14:16.090
<b>we become invincible.</b>

14:17.250 --> 14:19.420
<b>Amidamaru! Fire Ball Mode!</b>

14:21.300 --> 14:24.470
<b>I told you, didn't I? I bind this world with the next.</b>

14:24.510 --> 14:26.220
<b>That is what it means to be a shaman!</b>

14:27.470 --> 14:30.350
<b>Here we go! Soul Merge!</b>

14:31.520 --> 14:35.810
<b>What? The fire ball is entering his body?!</b>

14:47.450 --> 14:49.160
<b>Soul?</b>

14:49.350 --> 14:50.850
<b>Soul. What the..?</b>

14:50.880 --> 14:54.650
<b>It means, “A phenomenon of being possessed by a spirit”.</b>

14:54.670 --> 14:55.960
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

14:55.960 --> 14:59.000
<b>That he meant by binding this world with the next, he meant the <i>other </i>world.</b>

15:00.810 --> 15:03.150
<b>This is just the right amount for a conceited bastard like you.</b>

15:04.880 --> 15:07.140
<b>Now, it's your turn.</b>

15:07.680 --> 15:09.300
<b>Are you prepared?</b>

15:09.810 --> 15:11.720
<b>What's with this guy?</b>

15:11.720 --> 15:14.100
<b>He seems like a completely different guy than before.</b>

15:14.730 --> 15:15.520
<b>What's wrong?</b>

15:15.520 --> 15:17.980
<b>Having now witnessed a true sword,</b>

15:18.020 --> 15:21.360
<b>you're now going to run away with that toy in your hand?</b>

15:21.360 --> 15:22.150
<b>Brat!</b>

15:22.530 --> 15:26.990
<b>Don't fuck with me, you samurai wannabe!</b>

15:29.230 --> 15:31.120
<b>I understand it all now!</b>

15:31.910 --> 15:34.080
<b>By binding this world with the other,</b>

15:34.830 --> 15:37.540
<b>he can take a spirit into his own body,</b>

15:38.000 --> 15:39.920
<b>channeling the spirit's movements, skills,</b>

15:39.960 --> 15:43.550
<b>basically bringing everything it has to offer into this world!</b>

15:55.350 --> 15:57.690
<b>Rest assured, I won't kill you.</b>

15:58.150 --> 16:02.440
<b>I can't be bothered to make you become one of us.</b>

16:04.990 --> 16:06.360
<b>Ryuu!</b>

16:08.280 --> 16:10.820
<b>Run!</b>

16:11.830 --> 16:15.370
<b>Now I understand why he's always so laid back.</b>

16:15.870 --> 16:19.330
<b>Because he's so carefree, he can easily clear his mind.</b>

16:19.710 --> 16:24.840
<b>And because of that he can use the strength of the spirits.</b>

16:25.630 --> 16:29.050
<b>That is one that can bind this world with the next.</b>

16:29.720 --> 16:32.390
<b>The shaman, Asakura Yoh!</b>

16:34.100 --> 16:40.400
<b>In this world, many spirits left behind lots of feelings, along with memories, and couldn't afford to die yet.</b>

16:41.100 --> 16:43.650
<b>In order to become the Shaman King,</b>

16:43.690 --> 16:46.070
<b>I want to become friends with them.</b>

16:46.900 --> 16:48.450
<b>Shaman King?</b>

16:50.030 --> 16:52.910
<b>With that said, let's become friends, Amidamaru.</b>

16:52.950 --> 16:55.120
<b>Friends? With someone like me?</b>

16:55.450 --> 16:57.620
<b>Your swordsmanship was phenomenal.</b>

16:57.660 --> 17:01.120
<b>I couldn't help but feel a certain something when we became one together.</b>

17:04.710 --> 17:06.050
<b>I decline.</b>

17:06.510 --> 17:10.090
<b>I am bound to wait here just like I have for the past 600 years.</b>

17:11.640 --> 17:12.430
<b>For Mosuke, right?</b>

17:12.470 --> 17:14.390
<b>How did you know?</b>

17:14.810 --> 17:16.770
<b>I heard it all from the guy himself.</b>

17:16.810 --> 17:20.850
<b>You guys were best friends ever since you were kids.</b>

17:21.650 --> 17:26.570
<b>600 Years Ago</b>

17:22.730 --> 17:24.820
<b>So you're saying this magnificent katana</b>

17:24.820 --> 17:27.480
<b>was brought here by the both of you?</b>

17:28.320 --> 17:30.240
<b>That is indeed so, my lord.</b>

17:30.820 --> 17:33.160
<b>For I, who aims to become the greatest samurai.</b>

17:33.200 --> 17:35.950
<b>And I, who aims to become the greatest swordsmith.</b>

17:36.620 --> 17:38.660
<b>And to surpass the efforts of one another</b>

17:38.700 --> 17:41.960
<b>we have devoted ourselves working day and night.</b>

17:43.500 --> 17:46.800
<b>I have a special liking for swords myself.</b>

17:46.840 --> 17:50.090
<b>How about it, you two? 
Why don't you both work here?</b>

17:53.510 --> 17:55.100
<b>We did it, Amidamaru!</b>

17:55.100 --> 17:58.140
<b>Two lowly orphans like us have finally been acknowledged for our efforts!</b>

17:58.640 --> 18:02.600
<b>To think someone like you could present a sword to the feudal lord like that!</b>

18:03.230 --> 18:07.690
<b>All I did was make a sword that was beyond your measly capabilities!</b>

18:08.360 --> 18:11.570
<b>Make sure you become a fine blade the lord can count on.</b>

18:11.990 --> 18:12.780
<b>Of course.</b>

18:13.450 --> 18:16.950
<b>We'll never go back to those famished days.</b>

18:19.700 --> 18:21.580
<b>Kill Mosuke, you say?</b>

18:22.000 --> 18:23.830
<b>What surprises you so much?</b>

18:24.210 --> 18:27.340
<b>He's already presented me with this fine blade.</b>

18:28.000 --> 18:31.340
<b>There shall not be another sword this great in this world.</b>

18:31.380 --> 18:35.050
<b>At the very least, I am 
letting you, his friend, kill him.</b>

18:35.510 --> 18:37.850
<b>Isn't this an act of mercy?</b>

18:41.060 --> 18:42.310
<b>What the hell is going on.</b>

18:43.190 --> 18:45.400
<b>We made it this far, yet...</b>

18:45.400 --> 18:46.860
<b>What am I supposed to do now?</b>

18:47.520 --> 18:49.070
<b>You're going to run away from here.</b>

18:49.360 --> 18:51.320
<b>If I did, what would happen to you?</b>

18:51.780 --> 18:54.400
<b>That's right! Let's run away together! That way!</b>

18:54.430 --> 18:55.150
<b>We can't!</b>

18:55.200 --> 18:59.160
<b>As a samurai, I can't let myself betray the lord I once served!</b>

18:59.620 --> 19:03.620
<b>But there's just no way I can follow his order and kill you.</b>

19:04.710 --> 19:07.630
<b>I will accept and live with the dishonor of letting you run away.</b>

19:08.420 --> 19:09.460
<b>Amidamaru.</b>

19:11.420 --> 19:12.460
<b>I understand.</b>

19:13.670 --> 19:15.430
<b>But wait for me for just one day.</b>

19:15.970 --> 19:18.600
<b>Would you give me Harusame tonight?</b>

19:18.600 --> 19:19.810
<b>What?</b>

19:20.350 --> 19:22.520
<b>We may never see each other again.</b>

19:23.390 --> 19:27.150
<b>So let me give you the greatest katana this world has to offer.</b>

19:27.810 --> 19:30.900
<b>One that will surely outclass the sword I gave him.</b>

19:31.190 --> 19:32.570
<b>The strongest Harusame!</b>

19:36.030 --> 19:39.240
<b>Who's this now? Did you come here to die?</b>

19:39.280 --> 19:42.410
<b>I hate to break it to you, but whoever you're waiting for won't be coming.</b>

19:42.450 --> 19:43.540
<b>We made sure of that last night.</b>

19:43.540 --> 19:44.330
<b>Silence!</b>

19:45.040 --> 19:47.580
<b>I have no intention of leaving this place.</b>

19:48.250 --> 19:49.840
<b>As was promised!</b>

19:51.670 --> 19:54.050
<b>And that's how your legend came to be.</b>

19:54.710 --> 19:58.800
<b>The demon that slayed a thousand people with his terrific battle style.</b>

20:00.010 --> 20:04.550
<b>But without Harusame, 
I eventually ran out of strength.</b>

20:04.930 --> 20:06.440
<b>That's why I'm here!</b>

20:09.270 --> 20:12.270
<b>Is this Harusame?</b>

20:12.690 --> 20:16.740
<b>“I won't pass on until I hand this sword to him!” he said.</b>

20:17.200 --> 20:19.740
<b>He was so attached to this sword that he was waiting all this time.</b>

20:20.410 --> 20:24.040
<b>And I told him that you've been waiting all these 600 years too.</b>

20:25.540 --> 20:27.370
<b>You're kidding me.</b>

20:28.040 --> 20:31.460
<b>That idiot was really waiting all this time?</b>

20:31.790 --> 20:33.920
<b>You're both equally stupid, aren't you?</b>

20:34.340 --> 20:36.800
<b>So, let's hurry up and go see him already.</b>

20:37.470 --> 20:39.890
<b>What's with you?</b>

20:40.470 --> 20:42.470
<b>How am I supposed to face him like this?</b>

20:42.510 --> 20:44.310
<b>Harusame is roughed up after all this time!</b>

20:44.310 --> 20:46.350
<b>And a spirit like me can't
 even touch him anymore!</b>

20:46.390 --> 20:48.520
<b>You can.</b>

20:48.980 --> 20:51.350
<b>I'll let you borrow my body.</b>

20:51.770 --> 20:55.110
<b>Since I'm a shaman after all.</b>

20:55.150 --> 20:57.240
<b>What the hell is this?</b>

20:57.780 --> 20:58.400
<b>Here we go!</b>

20:59.170 --> 21:00.410
<b>Soul Merge!</b>

21:02.450 --> 21:05.660
<b>Alright! Let's go over to the nearest blacksmith!</b>

21:06.080 --> 21:08.960
<b>And so, that's how we repaired Harusame.</b>

21:11.420 --> 21:15.560
<b>I humbly accept Mosuke 
and Master Yoh's feelings.</b>

21:19.880 --> 21:22.550
<b>“Feelings" are what's crucial.</b>

21:26.600 --> 21:31.430
<b>Without a doubt, there's nobody who could forge a blade like this, except Mosuke himself.</b>

21:32.150 --> 21:36.070
<b>Mosuke left you a message too:
“Sorry to have kept you waiting”.</b>

21:37.480 --> 21:38.280
<b>Is that so?</b>

21:38.780 --> 21:40.530
<b>Who's this Mosuke person?</b>

21:40.720 --> 21:44.360
<b>He was too shy to see you face-to-face 
here so he went on ahead to the other world.</b>

21:45.120 --> 21:48.540
<b>That damn idiot, making me wait 600 years like this.</b>

21:50.000 --> 21:53.210
<b>I'd like to catch up to him right now and give him a swift blow to head, but...</b>

21:53.880 --> 21:59.630
<b>It appears it's not time to go to the other world yet, though.</b>

21:59.890 --> 22:00.530
<b>Huh?</b>

22:01.880 --> 22:04.890
<b>I'm going to accompany you, Master Yoh.</b>

22:09.720 --> 22:13.020
