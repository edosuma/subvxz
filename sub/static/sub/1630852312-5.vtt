07:40.590 --> 07:42.418
- With the first room
in the house.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.375
- [bleep].

07:43.419 --> 07:46.074
- Oh, my gosh, I like that.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.467
- I knew you would.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.033
- And it's thicker
than I thought.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.600
- Yeah.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.123
- I could get used to this.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.560
- Well, that's what
I'm talking about.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.126
Let me put you
on this plant life.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.738
[knock at door]
- Baby girl, open up, it's me.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.435
- Oh, no, it's my dad.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.741
He wasn't supposed
to be here till later.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.003
- Mason?

08:02.046 --> 08:02.960
- Should we get rid
of this food?

08:03.004 --> 08:04.658
- Yep.
One sec, Dad!

08:06.573 --> 08:08.270
[groans]
- Mm, mm.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.969
Hey, Daddy.
Sorry about that.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.884
We were just moving my couch.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.582
- Yeah,
it used to be right there,

08:15.625 --> 08:17.627
and then we tried
moving it right there,

08:17.671 --> 08:20.587
and then we were like,
"No, it's better right there."

08:20.630 --> 08:22.545
- It looks like you picked
the right spot.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.113
You must be Anthony.
Nice to meet you.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.941
- Nice to meet you, sir.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.246
- Mm, now, that's a handshake.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.510
And he's an accountant?
I like it.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.554
- Thank you, sir.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.034
- [sniffing]

08:33.077 --> 08:34.775
What is that smell?

08:34.818 --> 08:36.603
Were you all cooking
something up in here?

08:36.646 --> 08:37.734
both: No.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.170
- What you got
in the bag over here?

08:39.214 --> 08:41.651
Come on.
Now, let me see this bag.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.132
[chuckles]

08:44.175 --> 08:47.570
Veggie Grill?
What is this?

08:47.614 --> 08:50.834
- We were eating
veggie burgers.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.358
Dad, Anthony is a vegan.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.143
- Vegan?
- Oh, that's good.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.971
- It really is.
- No, it's not.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.189
Her dad definitely
doesn't like me

08:58.233 --> 09:00.148
and is insisting
we go to dinner.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.237
I'm gonna get grilled
by the grill master.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.021
- Oh, no, sorry.
I meant the story's good.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.327
You're definitely screwed.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.589
- Yeah, good luck with that.
Noah, you're up.

09:06.633 --> 09:07.895
How's trauma girl?

09:07.938 --> 09:10.245
- I mean, we still don't have
a ton in common,

09:10.288 --> 09:13.161
but the accident seems
to be the only spark we need.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.163
- Mmm, I love whiskey.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.512
- Whiskey makes me sick.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.037
- Oh.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.952
I think I'm still a little sore
from the accident.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.302
- You know what? I am too.
Can I--let me rub that for you.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.043
- Let me rub that for you.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.002
- Mm, oh.
- Oh.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.004
- Oh, yeah.
- Ooh! Ah!

09:30.047 --> 09:32.006
- We ended up getting
kicked out of the restaurant.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.661
It was dope.
[laughs]

09:34.704 --> 09:36.532
- So you had dinner,
but you took the sex to go.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.577
- Nice.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.232
- Wow, all these houses
were fresh,

09:41.276 --> 09:42.625
especially this last one.

09:42.669 --> 09:43.670
- Right?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.193
You could very comfortably
have sex

09:45.236 --> 09:47.021
in every room
of this house,

09:47.064 --> 09:48.370
even the pantry.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.328
- Word.
That's really important to me.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.503
- I could tell.

09:51.547 --> 09:52.940
Listen, the market moves
pretty quick,

09:52.983 --> 09:54.724
so if you're feeling it,
we should jump in on this.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.161
- I hear that.
But I'ma think on it.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.641
Yo, check it out, though.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.338
I'm having a little
thing-thing tonight,

10:00.382 --> 10:01.992
if y'all trying to kick it
at a mansion party.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.037
- Oh, sorry--

10:03.080 --> 10:04.734
- Oh, hell yeah,
we are in, man!

10:04.778 --> 10:06.170
- I'm sorry.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.825
My assistant seems to be
confused about the calendar.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.523
I think he means our schedule
is very tight with work.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.613
- I've actually never seen your
calendar this clear before.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.136
You're free for, like,
the next month or two.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.877
- Ha-ha. Excuse us.
- Hey, cool.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.706
I'm just gonna watch this
YouTube juggling compilation.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.577
- Oh, yeah, juggle, juggle.
I love 'em.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.797
What are you doing, Sherm?
- What are you doing?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.363
SayJack just invited us
to a party.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.930
- I don't have time to chill.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.498
I have other clients to check
in on and deals to review.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.891
I do not have time to waste

10:30.934 --> 10:33.067
with a buyer
who may or may not be serious.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.721
- Trust me,
just give him some time.

10:34.764 --> 10:35.809
You said it yourself,

10:35.852 --> 10:37.419
this could be
your biggest client.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.986
He's gonna tell all
his fancy friends about you,

10:39.029 --> 10:41.553
and the next thing you know,
you're on a private island

10:41.597 --> 10:43.381
sipping chamomile tea
with Rihanna.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.993
- I've always wanted
to sip tea with Bad Girl Riri.

10:46.036 --> 10:49.213
- And you deserve to sip tea
with Bad Girl Riri.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.606
Let's close this deal.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.347
- Are you sure this isn't
just about you

10:52.390 --> 10:53.870
trying to spend more time
with your hero?

10:53.914 --> 10:56.699
- No, this is about
getting you a sale.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.747
- Fine.
- Yes! [laughs]

11:00.790 --> 11:03.532
SayJack, my guy, we are in.
Let's party, fool.

11:03.575 --> 11:04.751
- Oh!

11:04.794 --> 11:06.100
- And by party,
I mean conduct business

11:06.143 --> 11:07.754
in a socially dynamic
environment.

11:10.887 --> 11:11.105
.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.889
- I have other offers, Bob.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.761
Don't [bleep] me on this.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.720
Call me back in five,
or I'll give you hell, okay?

11:17.764 --> 11:20.114
Okay, thanks.
Bye!

11:20.157 --> 11:23.900
- Nicky, put the phones down.
You're killing the vibe.

11:23.944 --> 11:27.338
- I'm not here for vibes.
I'm here to work, unlike you.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.905
- I am working.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.690
- ♪ Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo

11:30.733 --> 11:31.865
♪ Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo

11:31.908 --> 11:34.476
- I am only here to party!

11:34.519 --> 11:36.521
[crowd cheering]

11:36.565 --> 11:38.088
That is a sales strategy.

11:38.132 --> 11:41.352
Taking shots of the Goose
keep the goose loose, baby.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.659
Oh, ow, there he is.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.487
- Hey, guys,
thanks for coming, y'all.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.706
This is my guy Cedric.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.708
- Hey, what's goody?
Y'all artists too?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.492
- Actually,
this is my realtor, Nicky,

11:50.535 --> 11:51.841
and her assistant, Sherm.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.104
- Oh, I heard of y'all.
Loved your latest album.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.932
Can't wait
to hear what drops next.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.760
Peace.
- Oh.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.154
Cedric seems nice.
Where do you know him from?

12:00.197 --> 12:01.242
- I don't.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.591
I met him,
like, five minutes ago.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.767
I called him Cedric,
and he never corrected me.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.508
I actually don't know
anyone here, really.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.858
- Ain't this your party?
- The label puts it on.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.078
The truth is, the bigger I get,

12:11.121 --> 12:13.254
the harder it is
to keep the real ones around.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.778
- Well, speaking of real,
the houses you saw today

12:15.822 --> 12:17.562
are going to sell
before you know it.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.913
So any more thoughts?

12:19.956 --> 12:21.566
- Not yet.
- Okay.

12:21.610 --> 12:22.654
- Have you had
any more thoughts

12:22.698 --> 12:24.221
about taking another shot?

12:24.265 --> 12:26.310
- Oh, yes, bro!

12:26.354 --> 12:29.009
[laughter]

12:30.445 --> 12:32.316
- Whoa, what's all this?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.362
- You'll share more details
if you have a solid buzz going.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.363
Drink up.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.843
- That's a great idea.
But wait.

12:36.886 --> 12:37.974
- What are you doing?

12:38.018 --> 12:39.062
- Kristen is fully
invested now too.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.803
It's easier to record
a voice memo

12:40.847 --> 12:42.283
than retell her everything.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.894
- Hey, Kristen, okay,
so things took a bit of a dip

12:44.938 --> 12:46.069
when I invited her
back to my place.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.900
I've been reading
more Malcolm Gladwell lately.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.729
- Great.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.732
- Ah, you lost the trauma bond.
So you guys are through?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.125
- It seemed like
we were gonna be,

12:58.168 --> 12:59.822
but then
there was another spark.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.171
Well, actually, it was a--

13:01.215 --> 13:04.827
- Fire!
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Oh!

13:04.871 --> 13:07.047
Ah!
- Oh, my God, that was crazy!

13:07.090 --> 13:10.224
- So crazy, so crazy.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.573
[both moan]

13:11.616 --> 13:13.444
- That sounds hot.
- And hot.

13:13.488 --> 13:14.706
- Fire pun, nice.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.708
- No, stop high-fiving
my trauma.

13:16.752 --> 13:17.709
What are we gonna do when--

13:17.753 --> 13:19.320
- The fire dies?
- Nice.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.496
- This is really
getting dangerous.

13:21.539 --> 13:24.325
We have nothing in common.
I think I need to end it.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.370
- And when you do,
we'll be right here.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.372
- Mm-hmm.
- That's Noah's update, baby.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.417
I'll see you at home.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.548
And don't start
"Top Chef Junior"

13:30.592 --> 13:31.854
without me, okay?
Bye.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.160
- Bye, Kristen.
- See ya, Kristen.

13:33.203 --> 13:36.467
- So why you vegan?
- Dad.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.860
- What?
I'm just curious.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.210
- No, no, no, it's okay.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.777
My dad had some heart issues,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.474
so I became vegan
in solidarity.

13:43.518 --> 13:44.867
It started out
as just a health thing

13:44.911 --> 13:46.738
and sort of became
a lifestyle thing.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.392
- Good, good.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.741
So what y'all eating
over there?

13:49.785 --> 13:52.092
- It's a buffalo chicken pizza.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.485
It's cashew cheese,
and the chicken is tofu.

13:54.529 --> 13:57.401
- It really is good, Daddy.
- Oh, so you tried some?

13:57.445 --> 13:58.707
- I've tried a lot
of new things

13:58.750 --> 13:59.882
since I met Anthony.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.275
- But not too many things.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.886
Just the right amount
of things, sir.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.409
- Speaking of trying things,

14:05.453 --> 14:07.890
this brisket is some
grade A brisket right here.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.413
Why don't you try some, son?

14:09.457 --> 14:10.545
- Dad.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.155
- What?
It's very tender.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.896
You'll like it.
- It looks good.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.419
But no, thank you.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.507
- Come on, just a sliver.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.422
- I can't, sir.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.688
- Okay, how about some water?
Can you drink some water?

14:23.732 --> 14:25.603
Oh, no, animals swim in it.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.692
Hell, this country's going
right down the tubes.

14:27.736 --> 14:28.911
Your generation
is taking things

14:28.955 --> 14:30.260
right down the tubes, child.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.088
- Daddy, please don't do this.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.394
- You're the one doing it,
Mason.

14:33.437 --> 14:34.786
What the hell
has happened to you?

14:34.830 --> 14:37.267
Is this the life you want?
Damn!

14:37.311 --> 14:38.965
- Nicky, you're never
gonna believe it.

14:39.008 --> 14:42.446
SayJack just invited me back to
the studio to watch him record.

14:42.490 --> 14:46.320
- How is watching him record
gonna help us sell him a house?

14:46.363 --> 14:47.756
- I don't know.

14:47.799 --> 14:50.106
But you gotta let me go.
This is a dream.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.152
He's an inspiration.
He's like LeBron--

14:52.195 --> 14:56.112
- Michelle, Goldblum, I get it.
Yeah, I do.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.941
So just go.
Just give me back my phone.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.421
- What?
Why would I have your phone?

15:00.464 --> 15:01.901
- The phone
I gave you for work.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.294
- Oh, that phone.

15:04.338 --> 15:07.515
I may have left
that phone back at the office.

15:07.558 --> 15:10.213
- I gave you one job, Sherm.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.476
And it was literally
to hold a thing.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.783
- I'm sorry,
