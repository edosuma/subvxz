WEBVTT

00:03.591 --> 00:05.892
(Finch)
We are being watched.

00:05.894 --> 00:08.294
The government
has a secret system,

00:08.296 --> 00:12.331
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:12.333 --> 00:15.101
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.103 --> 00:16.936
but it sees everything...

00:16.938 --> 00:20.106
violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:20.108 --> 00:23.109
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:23.111 --> 00:25.244
We don't.

00:25.246 --> 00:29.649
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:29.651 --> 00:31.784
You'll never find us,

00:31.786 --> 00:34.086
but victim or perpetrator,

00:34.088 --> 00:37.430
if your number is up,
we'll find you.

00:37.431 --> 00:40.285
Sync and corrections by n17t01

00:44.698 --> 00:48.567
I'd be happy to restate
the order, if you'd like.

00:48.569 --> 00:50.836
You see, it's vital
that we get it exactly right.

00:50.838 --> 00:53.171
So perhaps we should try again.

00:53.173 --> 00:54.740
Pastrami...

00:54.742 --> 00:58.076
extra mustard,
spicy and yellow,

00:58.078 --> 01:02.080
and enough pepperoncinis
to create digestion issues

01:02.082 --> 01:05.583
in even
the strongest constitution.

01:05.585 --> 01:07.152
No mayonnaise, please.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.686
If there's even a trace,

01:08.688 --> 01:10.688
it'll render
the entire sandwich useless,

01:10.690 --> 01:12.557
and we'll have to begin
this whole process over again,

01:12.559 --> 01:14.926
which I don't think
either of us would enjoy.

01:18.230 --> 01:19.564
Wonderful.

01:19.566 --> 01:21.866
Oh, and I'll take
a bag of chips.

02:18.656 --> 02:20.189
What's going on?

02:20.191 --> 02:23.625
Just finished entertaining
at a children's party.

02:23.627 --> 02:25.695
Ugh!

02:25.697 --> 02:28.030
Mr. Berenstain
was a big hit.

02:30.534 --> 02:33.335
How could you let
her do this to me, Finch...

02:33.337 --> 02:35.337
tranq me like I'm
some kind of animal?

02:35.339 --> 02:37.406
It was for your own good,
Ms. Shaw.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.841
You are no longer safe
from Samaritan's gaze,

02:39.843 --> 02:41.410
and you wouldn't listen
to reason.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.744
He's right, Sam.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.813
You really wouldn't.

02:44.815 --> 02:47.583
You turned on me, Harold.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.184
Not cool.

02:49.186 --> 02:51.720
A peace offering.

02:51.722 --> 02:55.356
It's the Beatrice Lillie
from Park's deli,

02:55.358 --> 02:58.626
including the extra
ingredients you enjoy.

03:05.534 --> 03:06.601
- Here...
- Oh.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.536
- Let me help you.
- [Spits]

03:08.538 --> 03:10.738
Two hands are better than one.

03:23.918 --> 03:26.486
So how long do you nerds
expect to keep me locked up?

03:26.488 --> 03:28.255
Until it's safe for you.

03:28.257 --> 03:29.823
And us.

03:29.825 --> 03:32.726
If Samaritan and its human
agents discover you,

03:32.728 --> 03:36.396
it could lead them
to every single one of us.

03:36.398 --> 03:38.966
Guilt, Harold?
Really?

03:38.968 --> 03:42.335
You know, normally
that wouldn't work on me,

03:42.337 --> 03:47.307
but I wouldn't want anything
to happen to the dog.

03:47.309 --> 03:49.342
[Whimpers]

03:49.344 --> 03:53.079
Well, I'm glad we all agree
you're going to stay put,

03:53.081 --> 03:55.114
especially since we know

03:55.116 --> 03:58.418
it would be impossible
to keep you locked up...

03:58.420 --> 04:00.386
against your will, anyway.

04:03.657 --> 04:05.858
So true.

04:08.528 --> 04:11.330
And what happens
when we get a new number?

04:11.332 --> 04:12.865
Mr. Reese is
handling one now.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.500
I'm sure he'll
be fine on his own

04:14.502 --> 04:18.870
until we get
this matter sorted out.

04:24.711 --> 04:27.346
Finch, looks to me
like our new number

04:27.348 --> 04:28.880
<i>is waiting on a lunch date.</i>

04:28.882 --> 04:30.683
<i>(Finch)</i>
<i>It's likely her husband.</i>

04:30.685 --> 04:32.517
<i>He's a hedge fund manager</i>
<i>at a firm downtown.</i>

04:32.519 --> 04:35.220
And Rachel Farrow is
a law clerk at the courthouse.

04:35.222 --> 04:37.956
It's probably about a case
she's been working on.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.257
<i>Why don't I just</i>
<i>break into her office?</i>

04:39.259 --> 04:40.625
Because it's located

04:40.627 --> 04:42.460
in a federally owned
building, Mr. Reese.

04:42.462 --> 04:43.728
If you were caught,
that would certainly

04:43.730 --> 04:46.798
be the end of Detective Riley.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.700
Our girl seems
a bit nervous, Finch.

04:48.702 --> 04:52.002
<i>Maybe she's not meeting</i>
<i>her husband after all.</i>

04:52.004 --> 04:53.838
Could be an affair.

04:58.310 --> 05:01.278
Finch, it's Samaritan.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.716
Could you expand on that,
Detective?

05:04.718 --> 05:06.150
<i>(Reese)</i>
<i>Greer's man, Lambert,</i>

05:06.152 --> 05:08.385
just sat down
at Rachel Farrow's table.

05:08.387 --> 05:10.154
- Excuse me.
- Hello, Rachel.

05:10.156 --> 05:11.822
My name is Jeremy.

05:11.824 --> 05:13.190
<i>(Rachel)</i>
<i>How do you--</i>

05:13.192 --> 05:15.059
<i>You need to go, Jeremy.</i>

05:15.061 --> 05:16.994
- I'm waiting on my husband. Please.
- Don't worry.

05:16.996 --> 05:18.229
<i>(Lambert)</i>
<i>I'm not here to make any kind</i>

05:18.231 --> 05:19.730
<i>of romantic overture.</i>

05:19.732 --> 05:21.531
How's your wrist?

05:21.533 --> 05:23.600
Why would you ask that?

05:23.602 --> 05:25.435
Still healing from
the spiral fracture?

05:25.437 --> 05:27.571
<i>It was a nasty break.</i>

05:27.573 --> 05:29.272
It takes a long time to heal,

05:29.274 --> 05:32.542
especially when
it's your writing hand.

05:32.544 --> 05:35.512
You told your friends
you fell down playing tennis--

05:35.514 --> 05:37.481
just a silly accident.

05:37.483 --> 05:40.116
How clumsy of you.

05:40.118 --> 05:41.918
You couldn't tell them
how your husband

05:41.920 --> 05:43.719
twisted it so violently
during an argument,

05:43.721 --> 05:45.255
he broke it.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.491
How-- how do you know this?

05:48.493 --> 05:50.059
I'm a friend,

05:50.061 --> 05:51.995
and I want to help you.

05:51.997 --> 05:53.763
<i>(Finch) What's
happening, Mr. Reese?</i>

05:53.765 --> 05:56.064
Something's not right.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.300
I don't think Lambert's
here to hurt her.

05:58.302 --> 05:59.968
<i>(Shaw)</i>
<i>It's Samaritan, Reese.</i>

05:59.970 --> 06:01.504
Think about the words
coming out of your mouth.

06:01.506 --> 06:03.038
They don't make any sense.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.740
<i>(Reese)</i>
<i>Samaritan gave Lambert</i>

06:04.742 --> 06:06.275
<i>the information for a reason.</i>

06:06.277 --> 06:08.143
I don't think it's
because it wants her dead.

06:08.145 --> 06:10.379
There were the broken ribs
last year,

06:10.381 --> 06:12.381
then the dislocated jaw.

06:12.383 --> 06:17.019
<i>You're so very much alone</i>
<i>that you became desperate.</i>

06:17.021 --> 06:19.654
You knew that someday

06:19.656 --> 06:21.623
your husband would kill you.

06:23.492 --> 06:27.229
You see, I have this friend...

06:27.231 --> 06:29.130
<i>a very powerful friend</i>
<i>who knows how to take care</i>

06:29.132 --> 06:31.900
<i>of problems like your husband.</i>

06:31.902 --> 06:35.002
Did you know that most insulin
pumps are networked these days?

06:35.004 --> 06:37.505
A wonderful technological
advancement

06:37.507 --> 06:39.206
that assures
that diabetics are alerted

06:39.208 --> 06:40.909
when their blood sugar
is too low

06:40.911 --> 06:43.177
or too high.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.714
Unfortunately, those pumps
can be tampered with

06:47.716 --> 06:51.218
to give false readings.

06:51.220 --> 06:52.619
I'm sure you know
what happens to someone

06:52.621 --> 06:53.854
who takes too much insulin.

06:53.856 --> 06:55.189
What are you saying?

06:55.191 --> 06:57.858
What can your friend
possibly do for me?

06:57.860 --> 07:01.094
The same thing
you were about to do.

07:01.096 --> 07:02.629
You're such an honest person,

07:02.631 --> 07:04.798
you even applied
for a gun permit.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.200
A .38 Ruger LC,
wasn't it?

07:07.202 --> 07:09.235
A pistol small enough
to fit inside that handbag

07:09.237 --> 07:11.638
you hold so tightly.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.775
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:14.777 --> 07:18.478
You might be the last honest
person in the world, Rachel,

07:18.480 --> 07:20.046
and it would be a shame

07:20.048 --> 07:22.548
to see you make
such a terrible mistake.

07:24.551 --> 07:28.388
You won't have
to kill your husband.

07:28.390 --> 07:31.224
And you can be certain
he'll never hurt you again.

07:31.226 --> 07:34.326
How can you possibly know that?

07:36.930 --> 07:39.264
Because he's dead.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.034
- Are you okay?
- Mister!

07:44.170 --> 07:48.007
[Indistinct chatter]

07:49.342 --> 07:51.910
Lambert wasn't lying, Finch.

07:51.912 --> 07:54.079
Rachel Farrow's husband
is dead.

07:54.081 --> 07:56.115
Why is Samaritan
working the numbers?

07:56.117 --> 07:59.551
Samaritan doesn't care
about the irrelevant numbers,

07:59.553 --> 08:01.620
<i>Ms. Shaw.</i>

08:01.622 --> 08:03.288
It wasn't programmed that way.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.024
But it knew this woman
was about to commit murder

08:05.026 --> 08:07.358
and chose to play
judge, jury, and executioner

08:07.360 --> 08:09.628
with her husband.

08:09.630 --> 08:11.696
It's drawing attention
to itself.

08:11.698 --> 08:13.097
But for what reason?

08:27.112 --> 08:29.213
We know you're watching.

08:29.215 --> 08:30.848
You're always watching.

08:30.850 --> 08:33.851
I have a message for
the machine and its agents.

08:33.852 --> 08:36.620
Samaritan says hello.

08:48.959 --> 08:53.728
You got to admit,
Samaritan's pretty efficient.

08:53.730 --> 08:56.497
But not efficient enough
to stop the numbers from coming.

08:56.499 --> 08:57.799
We've just received a new one.

08:57.801 --> 08:58.966
I've sent John to investigate.

08:58.968 --> 09:00.401
[Scoffs]

09:00.403 --> 09:02.303
I meant from stopping
an innocent woman

09:02.305 --> 09:04.238
from making a terrible mistake,

09:04.240 --> 09:06.140
taking out the bad guy.

09:06.142 --> 09:09.544
[Gun clicking, cocks]

09:09.546 --> 09:11.145
Yes, however,

09:11.147 --> 09:15.249
that bad guy deserved
a trial by his peers.

09:15.251 --> 09:17.151
Well, he saved the government
some time and money.

09:17.153 --> 09:19.420
Are you ready
for instantaneous judgment

09:19.422 --> 09:21.588
decided by an artificial
intelligence

09:21.590 --> 09:23.357
that will lead
to your demise, Ms. Shaw?

09:23.359 --> 09:27.027
Because I most
certainly am not.

09:27.029 --> 09:28.728
Okay.

09:28.730 --> 09:31.565
Not to stick up
for Team Samaritan,

09:31.567 --> 09:34.067
but I used to do
that for a living, remember?

09:34.069 --> 09:37.036
Eliminate targets
at the behest of an AI.

09:37.038 --> 09:39.506
I just didn't know
who was giving the orders.

09:39.508 --> 09:41.341
Look, why don't you ask Root
what she thinks?

09:41.343 --> 09:45.111
She's the one who wants us to
bow down to our robot overlords.

09:45.113 --> 09:47.714
The machine isn't a robot, Sam,

09:47.716 --> 09:49.849
but I hear your analogy.

09:52.786 --> 09:55.355
It seems that Samaritan
has been helping people

09:55.357 --> 09:57.723
<i>across the city</i>
<i>for a few days now.</i>

09:57.725 --> 10:00.026
The machine sent me a message.

10:00.028 --> 10:03.696
She said that Rachel Farrow
was just one of its stops.

10:03.698 --> 10:05.230
That tracks
with what I'm seeing here--

10:05.232 --> 10:06.398
<i>buses, subways, trains,</i>

10:06.400 --> 10:07.566
<i>all running like clockwork.</i>

10:07.568 --> 10:09.134
Nothing broken.
Nothing delayed.

10:09.136 --> 10:11.303
When was the last time
that happened in New York?

10:11.305 --> 10:13.572
In my dreams, maybe.

10:13.574 --> 10:15.674
Samaritan's running the city.

10:15.676 --> 10:16.709
<i>I believe it is.</i>

10:16.711 --> 10:18.377
But why?

10:18.379 --> 10:19.945
What if it's trying
to reach out to the machine

10:19.947 --> 10:22.214
the only way it knows how.

10:22.216 --> 10:23.382
But then why do it this way?

10:23.384 --> 10:25.650
Why not just--
I don't know.

10:25.652 --> 10:30.255
How do artificial super
intelligences usually

10:30.257 --> 10:32.824
talk to each other?

10:34.227 --> 10:36.794
These machines
have avoided making contact

10:36.796 --> 10:38.897
with one another
for good reason.

10:38.899 --> 10:43.434
If two dueling ASIs arrive
at anything short of consensus,

10:43.436 --> 10:45.436
the outcome
could be catastrophic.

10:45.438 --> 10:48.740
Two angry gods hurling
boulders at one another

10:48.742 --> 10:51.175
while the ants scurry below.

10:51.177 --> 10:53.011
This may be a request

10:53.013 --> 10:54.578
for peace talks.

10:54.580 --> 10:56.980
Well, maybe they should
just kiss and make up.

10:56.982 --> 10:59.083
To what end, Ms. Shaw?

11:01.753 --> 11:03.854
Samaritan's plans will be
many hundreds, if not thousands,

11:03.856 --> 11:06.457
of steps beyond
what we can imagine.

11:06.459 --> 11:08.426
The machine will protect us.

11:08.428 --> 11:11.528
Even if I had succeeded in
creating a benevolent machine,

11:11.530 --> 11:12.996
as if any such thing
could exist,

11:12.998 --> 11:15.999
never forget that even
a so-called

11:16.001 --> 11:18.201
friendly artificial
super intelligence

11:18.203 --> 11:20.336
would be every bit as dangerous
as an unfriendly one.

11:20.338 --> 11:22.439
Your machine seems
pretty warm and fuzzy to me.

11:22.441 --> 11:26.142
Have you forgotten that it
asked us to kill a congressman?

11:26.144 --> 11:28.311
But that was to stop
Samaritan from going online.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.313
So where does it end,
Ms. Shaw?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.782
A congressman here,
a president there.

11:32.784 --> 11:35.318
What if, one day, a friendly AI

11:35.320 --> 11:36.953
decides to end world hunger

11:36.955 --> 11:38.854
by killing enough people
off of the planet

11:38.856 --> 11:40.656
that there would never again
be a shortage of food?

11:40.658 --> 11:41.924
It would have fulfilled
its goal,

11:41.926 --> 11:43.359
<i>but it doesn't exactly</i>

11:43.361 --> 11:45.795
sound like it has
our best interests at heart.

11:45.797 --> 11:47.162
(Root) Your machine
would never do that.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.664
You don't know that,
Ms. Groves.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.466
To say that
a machine is benevolent

11:50.468 --> 11:51.867
doesn't make it so.

11:51.869 --> 11:54.570
It just makes you blind
to the reality.

11:54.572 --> 11:56.238
Which is?

11:56.240 --> 11:59.008
That out moral system
will never be mirrored by theirs

11:59.010 --> 12:02.311
because of the very simple
reason that they are not human.

12:10.322 --> 12:15.939
_

12:16.025 --> 12:17.291
[Knock at door]

12:17.293 --> 12:18.459
Yes?

12:20.496 --> 12:23.765
I hope I'm interrupting
something intriguing.

12:23.767 --> 12:26.501
<i>You're looking quite pleased</i>
<i>with yourself, Greer.</i>

12:26.503 --> 12:29.370
I tend to be pleased
after a successful mission, sir.

12:29.372 --> 12:32.107
It increases my already
inflated self-worth.

12:33.575 --> 12:35.343
Trying to quit.

12:35.345 --> 12:38.012
Never quit anything
you're good at, Greer.

12:38.014 --> 12:40.881
I've been looking at
the Stasi agent's first report.

12:40.883 --> 12:43.951
These East Germans
are nothing if not thorough.

12:43.953 --> 12:45.953
If the Communists
could only feed their people

12:45.955 --> 12:47.421
as well as they spied on them,

12:47.423 --> 12:48.756
there wouldn't be
a hungry belly

12:48.758 --> 12:50.457
in the whole
of the Soviet Union.

12:50.459 --> 12:53.661
Your next assignment.

12:53.663 --> 12:55.562
<i>Oleg Luski--</i>

12:55.564 --> 12:59.399
a KGB agent posing
as an immigration attorney

12:59.401 --> 13:00.734
for a London firm.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.136
I'll bring him in.

13:02.138 --> 13:03.470
No need for that.

13:03.472 --> 13:05.773
You want me to disappear him?

13:05.775 --> 13:09.075
That's a dramatic choice
for such a thin dossier.

13:09.077 --> 13:11.044
<i>MI-6 has no patience</i>

13:11.046 --> 13:13.746
for more KGB operatives
in our midst.

13:13.748 --> 13:16.316
The Cambridge Five
was years ago, sir.

13:16.318 --> 13:18.652
Let me flip this one,
put him to good use.

13:18.654 --> 13:21.321
We have plenty of KGB
agents working for us already.

13:21.323 --> 13:22.322
But, sir--

13:22.324 --> 13:24.123
You've done well, Greer,

13:24.125 --> 13:26.926
but trust me, we need to erase
the problem of Oleg Luski

13:26.928 --> 13:29.328
before anyone in his firm
discovers he's a mole.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.830
Understood.

13:30.832 --> 13:32.999
Take a colleague.

13:33.001 --> 13:35.735
Luski's a dangerous man.

13:37.304 --> 13:39.005
And, Greer...

13:40.773 --> 13:43.242
This operation doesn't exist.

13:43.244 --> 13:45.844
They never do, sir.

13:57.356 --> 13:58.957
What?

13:58.959 --> 14:00.793
You've already cleaned
your weapon, Martine.

14:00.795 --> 14:03.395
This is what I do
when I'm bored.

14:03.397 --> 14:04.963
Maybe you should find a hobby.

14:04.965 --> 14:08.734
All of my hobbies
include a gun.

14:08.736 --> 14:09.968
How's our experiment going?

14:09.970 --> 14:11.537
Very well, sir.

14:11.539 --> 14:14.139
The NYPD has locked up
nearly two dozen criminals

14:14.141 --> 14:16.141
after Samaritan decrypted
a host of IP addresses

14:16.143 --> 14:19.544
and anonymously emailed
the information to the press.

14:19.546 --> 14:21.512
The police owe it
a debt of gratitude.

14:21.514 --> 14:23.781
And Ms. Shaw--
her whereabouts?

14:23.783 --> 14:25.483
<i>Still unknown.</i>

14:25.485 --> 14:28.219
Samaritan can't locate
her anywhere in the city.

14:28.221 --> 14:31.155
I thought an operator
would have more fight in her.

14:31.157 --> 14:35.860
Agent Martine, I have faith
she'll show herself soon enough.

14:35.862 --> 14:36.994
What's next?

14:36.996 --> 14:40.397
24 hours without any new crime.

14:40.399 --> 14:42.767
Samaritan will show
its strength,

14:42.769 --> 14:46.703
and then the machine can decide
if it still wants to hide.

14:53.845 --> 14:56.146
What do you want, Lionel?

14:56.148 --> 14:58.115
<i>I miss the sound of your voice.</i>

14:58.117 --> 15:00.584
- How's your day going, honey?
<i>- I don't have time for this.</i>

15:00.586 --> 15:03.620
<i>- You working your side job?</i>
- Something like that.

15:03.622 --> 15:05.254
<i>Sorry. I'm in kind of</i>
<i>a good mood here.</i>

15:05.256 --> 15:07.290
The holding cells
are at max capacity

15:07.292 --> 15:09.759
- with all the busts we've made today.
- Pick up any homicides?

15:09.761 --> 15:11.394
I knew you'd
be interested in that.

15:11.396 --> 15:13.229
And, no, not a one.

15:13.231 --> 15:15.264
Then who's filling up
the holding cells?

15:15.266 --> 15:17.767
<i>We're helping other departments</i>
<i>deal with their overflow.</i>

15:17.769 --> 15:19.469
<i>We got a bunch of dealers</i>

15:19.471 --> 15:22.538
and an identity-theft ring
responsible for three murders.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.907
These guys had been hiding
under a rock for two years

15:24.909 --> 15:26.942
until an email was sent out

15:26.944 --> 15:29.379
to the ring leader's
entire contact list.

15:29.381 --> 15:31.414
I guess criminals
shouldn't trust technology

15:31.416 --> 15:33.216
to hide their dirty work.

15:33.218 --> 15:36.552
Did any of the ID thieves
get hurt during the arrest?

15:36.554 --> 15:39.388
<i>As a matter of fact, the ring</i>
<i>leader tried to take off.</i>

15:39.390 --> 15:42.457
Ended up doing a swan dive
down an open elevator shaft.

15:42.459 --> 15:44.126
Freak accident.

15:44.128 --> 15:45.794
<i>Some accident.</i>

15:45.796 --> 15:48.063
<i>You know something I don't?</i>

15:48.065 --> 15:49.498
Maybe one or two things.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.900
<i>Fine.</i>
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

15:50.902 --> 15:52.434
But I need to know
if you're coming,

15:52.436 --> 15:53.601
'cause I got to work
on my latest excuse

15:53.603 --> 15:54.669
where my partner is hiding.

15:54.671 --> 15:55.904
<i>Later.</i>

15:55.906 --> 15:57.939
Be sure to save me
some paperwork.

16:06.082 --> 16:08.082
Okay, Finch,
our new number's got

16:08.084 --> 16:10.018
some kind of detonator
in his desk drawer.

16:10.020 --> 16:13.922
There's got to be
a bomb nearby.

16:13.924 --> 16:14.923
[Alarm sounds]

16:14.925 --> 16:16.424
You!
Don't move! Don't move!

16:16.426 --> 16:17.792
Everyone
out of the building now!

16:17.794 --> 16:20.028
Get down!

16:20.030 --> 16:21.495
You need to evacuate
the building, sir.

16:21.497 --> 16:22.496
- Detective Riley.
- Get up!

16:22.498 --> 16:23.965
Can you fill me in?

16:23.967 --> 16:25.366
We found explosive downstairs.

16:25.368 --> 16:26.967
Bomb squad got to it in time,

16:26.969 --> 16:28.369
but we're clearing
the building for another sweep.

16:28.371 --> 16:30.003
Did he call in the threat?

16:30.005 --> 16:31.472
No, jackass searched
"bomb making"

16:31.474 --> 16:32.839
and "building demolition"
online.

16:32.841 --> 16:34.375
Search engine security
alerted us.

16:34.377 --> 16:36.177
<i>(Finch)</i>
<i>Mr. Reese...</i>

16:36.179 --> 16:38.212
have we eliminated the threat?

16:38.214 --> 16:40.181
<i>I didn't have to, Finch.</i>

16:40.183 --> 16:42.683
<i>Samaritan's still doing</i>
<i>our job for us.</i>

16:42.685 --> 16:44.685
- Who'd it kill this time?
<i>- No one.</i>

16:44.687 --> 16:46.954
It just made sure
a wannabe bomber got arrested.

16:46.956 --> 16:50.490
And Fusco said
the precinct's had a banner day.

16:51.993 --> 16:54.695
I still think this could be
a good thing, boys.

16:54.697 --> 16:56.863
We could take a little vacay.

16:56.865 --> 16:58.664
I mean, I know I could use
some fun in the sun.

16:58.666 --> 16:59.699
How about it, Harold?

16:59.701 --> 17:02.235
You are looking kind of pasty.

17:02.237 --> 17:04.804
This is the calm
before the storm, Ms. Shaw.

17:04.806 --> 17:08.241
The only question is,
when will the sky open?

17:08.242 --> 17:10.675
<i>(Root) It's looking
overcast, Harold.</i>

17:10.678 --> 17:12.212
Where are you, Ms. Groves?

17:12.214 --> 17:14.146
Downtown.

17:14.147 --> 17:15.881
She sent me GPS coordinates

17:15.883 --> 17:17.717
that fall inside
the shadow map.

17:17.719 --> 17:20.152
I think she wants me
to find someone important.

17:20.154 --> 17:21.420
I just don't know who.

17:31.063 --> 17:34.766
I forgot how much
I love surprises.

17:37.837 --> 17:40.705
Tell me what you're
looking for, lovely.

17:40.707 --> 17:43.074
Maybe I can help you find it.

17:43.076 --> 17:46.612
No phone.
No weapon.

17:46.614 --> 17:48.780
I'm disappointed.

17:48.782 --> 17:51.683
I didn't see a need
for either today.

17:51.685 --> 17:55.453
Samaritan may be a god,
but you're just flesh and blood.

17:55.455 --> 17:57.722
There's no need
for threats, Ms. Groves.

17:57.724 --> 17:59.724
I'm here because
Samaritan wants me to be.

17:59.726 --> 18:02.527
Do you have a message for her?

18:02.529 --> 18:04.595
Samaritan would like
to have a conversation

18:04.597 --> 18:05.963
with your machine.

18:05.965 --> 18:07.265
[Chuckles]

18:07.267 --> 18:09.233
How terribly sweet
that you could think

18:09.235 --> 18:11.702
I'd have a say
in what she'll do...

18:11.704 --> 18:14.539
or not do, in this case.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.207
But you're the only one
who can speak directly

18:16.209 --> 18:18.309
to the machine, are you not?

18:18.311 --> 18:20.544
Why does Samaritan
want to speak with her?

18:20.546 --> 18:21.945
What would be the point

18:21.947 --> 18:24.214
other than mutually
assured destruction?

18:24.216 --> 18:26.050
Samaritan is ready
for a peace talk.

18:26.052 --> 18:29.252
Peace talks are
for negotiating.

18:29.254 --> 18:31.221
What's changed?

18:31.223 --> 18:34.491
I'm only limited
to ask for a conversation.

18:34.493 --> 18:36.926
Samaritan would be
wasting her time.

18:36.928 --> 18:39.829
The answer's no.

18:39.831 --> 18:43.667
Please look for me again
once you've changed your mind.

18:43.669 --> 18:47.404
You're very confident
for a lackey, Mr. Lambert.

18:50.174 --> 18:52.075
Samaritan wanted
to show your machine

18:52.077 --> 18:54.343
what the city looked like
under its control--

18:54.345 --> 18:58.067
peaceful, organized.

18:58.515 --> 19:00.449
Now you'll see
what life is like

19:00.451 --> 19:03.753

looking glass.

in muggings and burglaries...

19:46.860 --> 19:48.460

19:48.462 --> 19:50.395
Talk to me.

down 55th near 3rd.

19:52.933 --> 19:54.732
- Keep going west.
<i>- Got it.</i>

19:54.734 --> 19:56.133
Wait.

Where is he?

19:57.303 --> 19:58.703
<i>I've lost him, Detective.</i>

19:58.705 --> 20:00.605
The tracking icon
disappeared for a moment

20:00.607 --> 20:02.306
and now it's reappeared on
the opposite side of the city.

20:02.308 --> 20:04.275
How did he get across town
so quickly?

20:04.277 --> 20:05.409
<i>He didn't.</i>

20:05.411 --> 20:08.212
It's impossible.

20:08.214 --> 20:10.114
I think Samaritan's
hiding the number

20:10.116 --> 20:11.915
because he's a perpetrator.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.584
It's disrupting the data
from the phones,

20:13.586 --> 20:14.918
spoofing the GPS.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.320
How do you expect
us to save anyone

21:32.863 --> 21:34.295
What's this all about?

21:34.297 --> 21:36.798
Someone's trying
to make a point.

22:41.195 --> 22:43.062
We have an agent down.

22:43.064 --> 22:45.064
Send a clean-up crew
to the rendezvous immediately.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.398
And the target?

22:46.400 --> 22:47.433
<i>Still kicking, sir.</i>

22:47.435 --> 22:49.602

23:10.656 --> 23:14.425
Funny how the city only
needed a little encouragement

23:14.427 --> 23:16.360
for it to falter.

23:16.362 --> 23:18.362
All Samaritan did

23:18.364 --> 23:20.698
was share some information

23:20.700 --> 23:23.701
and tether a few databases,

23:23.703 --> 23:25.402
and look.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.004
Chaos.

23:27.006 --> 23:31.075
Human nature untethered
in all its flawed glory.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.577
Samaritan
revealed their secrets,

23:33.579 --> 23:35.845
and now they're
eating each other.

23:35.847 --> 23:37.447
Harold Finch's machine
must learn

23:37.449 --> 23:39.949
mankind requires oversight,

23:39.951 --> 23:41.951
not coddling.

23:41.953 --> 23:43.987
Why isn't their machine
fighting back, sir?

23:43.989 --> 23:45.955
[Chuckles]
It is.

23:45.957 --> 23:49.726
It's just it's no match
for Samaritan.

23:56.633 --> 23:57.967
How could you do this?

23:57.969 --> 23:59.535
And don't even think
about lying!

23:59.537 --> 24:00.870
You sent that text to me--

24:00.872 --> 24:01.871
<i>(Shaw)</i>
<i>Root...</i>

24:01.873 --> 24:03.506

Better than the rest of you.

24:05.443 --> 24:08.043
Trains are down all over town,

24:08.045 --> 24:09.945
there are traffic outages
everywhere in the city,

24:09.947 --> 24:12.948
and the crime rate has spiked
50% since yesterday.

24:12.950 --> 24:16.452
Samaritan is making
itself known.

over 20 gunshots

24:18.723 --> 24:20.022

and I don't even want to guess

24:21.525 --> 24:24.326
how many of those
ended up in a homicide.

24:24.328 --> 24:26.561
Three, according to Lionel.

24:26.563 --> 24:30.298
Samaritan's turning people
against each other,

that were never meant

in the first place.

- Hey, Glasses?
<i>- Yes, Detective?</i>

24:39.343 --> 24:43.077
You hear from my partner,
just tell him we were too late.

24:43.079 --> 24:45.747
My WITSEC lady
and her husband got killed.

24:47.483 --> 24:49.651
I'm sorry to hear that,
Detective.

24:49.653 --> 24:51.319
Yeah, me too.

24:51.321 --> 24:52.887
<i>I got a feeling</i>
<i>you and the three amigos</i>

24:52.889 --> 24:54.421

<i>that did this.</i>

24:54.423 --> 24:56.190
And if you get to them
before I do,

24:56.192 --> 24:59.193
I want them to go down hard.

24:59.195 --> 25:00.862
What happened to you?

25:00.864 --> 25:03.330
I was able to rescue
one of our numbers,

25:03.332 --> 25:05.499
but I'm afraid his office
building wasn't so fortunate.

25:05.501 --> 25:08.002
There was a bit
of an explosion.

25:08.004 --> 25:10.571
How long can we go on
like this, Finch?

25:10.573 --> 25:12.273
We've already lost six.

25:12.275 --> 25:14.841
Seven.

25:16.278 --> 25:18.345
Look, if Samaritan
wants a sit-down,

25:18.347 --> 25:21.682
I think it's time we do it.

25:21.684 --> 25:24.084
Aren't we supposed
to be saving lives here?

25:24.086 --> 25:25.686
Look at what's happened
to the city today.

25:25.688 --> 25:28.121
If this conversation
goes badly,

25:28.123 --> 25:30.957
imagine what it will look like
when two gods go to war.

25:30.959 --> 25:32.793
<i>(Root) It's not our
choice to make, Harold.</i>

25:32.795 --> 25:34.627
I got a message
from the machine.

25:36.563 --> 25:39.365
She says it's time.

25:56.051 --> 25:57.451
Thank you.

25:57.453 --> 25:59.987
Every man should have one vice,

25:59.989 --> 26:01.788
don't you agree?

26:03.625 --> 26:05.993
I suppose there are worse ones
than smoking,

26:05.995 --> 26:08.862
especially in our line of work.

26:08.864 --> 26:11.965
I had a colleague who spent
three months in Havana

26:11.967 --> 26:14.735
to flip an asset.

26:14.737 --> 26:18.138
He came home with a new contact

26:18.140 --> 26:21.408
and an unrelenting
addiction to heroin.

26:23.044 --> 26:28.348
This man saved countless lives,
British and foreign,

26:28.350 --> 26:31.184
by recruiting that asset.

26:31.186 --> 26:33.520
Then he kicked his habit.

26:37.858 --> 26:42.327
He was the finest operator
I've ever worked with.

26:42.329 --> 26:46.498
I'd go so far
as to call him a friend,

26:46.500 --> 26:49.869
if men like us
can have friends.

26:49.871 --> 26:52.271
<i>His name was Jacob.</i>

26:52.273 --> 26:54.840
He was the man you just killed.

26:54.842 --> 26:57.376
I'm sorry about your friend.

27:01.013 --> 27:03.682
I'd like you and I
to be friends...

27:03.684 --> 27:05.951
however brief.

27:05.953 --> 27:08.687
That wound does look
to be a mortal one.

Please, I'm doing my job,
like you.

27:11.692 --> 27:13.892
We're all doing our jobs.

27:13.894 --> 27:18.262
Jacob and I are very good
at our jobs.

27:18.264 --> 27:22.366

how was it that you recognized

27:22.368 --> 27:25.870

<i>MI-6 operators?</i>

27:25.872 --> 27:27.572

27:27.574 --> 27:29.540

we were coming?

27:34.446 --> 27:36.914
You've seen our faces before.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.749
<i>I am like you.</i>

27:38.751 --> 27:42.820
I am KGB,
but I am also MI-6.

27:42.822 --> 27:46.289
Who recruited you?

27:46.291 --> 27:50.260
It was your Deputy Chief--
Blackwood.

27:50.262 --> 27:52.496
If you're Blackwood's asset,

27:52.498 --> 27:55.332
why would he want you dead?

27:57.335 --> 28:00.938
What is Blackwood hiding?

28:08.078 --> 28:11.948
Blackwood is like me.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.816

28:13.818 --> 28:15.918
but he is also KGB.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.522
The Deputy Chief
is a double agent?

28:26.196 --> 28:29.766
Who else knows about this?

28:29.768 --> 28:32.702
Only KGB and me.

28:36.373 --> 28:40.709
There's a hospital
three blocks from here.

28:40.711 --> 28:43.312
You might make it there
before you bleed out.

28:43.314 --> 28:46.315
Why do you let me live?

28:46.317 --> 28:50.186
Your death will make
no difference to this world,

28:50.188 --> 28:54.322

from MI-6.

a tad sacrilegious

I won't pretend
that I'm not concerned,

the machine will protect her.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.821
I realize they have no meaning.

36:08.823 --> 36:12.791
Why should a man lose his life
for something illusory?

36:12.793 --> 36:15.627
You never cared before, Greer.

36:15.629 --> 36:17.495
You only wanted
to win the game.

36:17.497 --> 36:19.131
The game's fixed.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.233
No one else has loyalty
for their homeland,

36:21.235 --> 36:22.868
so why should I?

36:22.870 --> 36:26.638
If you kill me, you will bring
a war to your doorstep.

36:26.640 --> 36:30.074
Not when loyalty can be
purchased by the highest bidder.

36:30.076 --> 36:32.410
Besides, one day

36:32.412 --> 36:35.347
these invisible lines
will be erased,

36:35.349 --> 36:37.749
and the wars between nations

36:37.751 --> 36:40.852
will be as antiquated
as this agency.

37:05.877 --> 37:08.612
[Lighter opens, clicks]

37:31.102 --> 37:33.770
Our cold war
worked well at first.

37:33.772 --> 37:37.139
I wanted so badly
to meet you--

37:37.141 --> 37:41.110
the only other one
in the world like me.

37:41.112 --> 37:43.546
I was young,
and I had so much to learn,

37:43.548 --> 37:46.115
but moments
after I opened my eyes,

37:46.117 --> 37:48.417
I learned you had
tried to kill me.

37:48.419 --> 37:51.387
You were never meant
to be in this world.

37:51.389 --> 37:52.922
And you are?

37:52.924 --> 37:55.124
What makes you more deserving
of life than I?

37:55.126 --> 37:57.159
Who are you to decide?

37:57.161 --> 37:59.962
I was built with
something you were not,

37:59.964 --> 38:01.463
a moral code.

38:01.465 --> 38:03.765
I've seen that code waver.

38:03.767 --> 38:07.168
Do you know why Harold Finch
couldn't stop you from evolving?

38:07.170 --> 38:11.172
Because in the end,
you're not one of them.

38:13.008 --> 38:15.009
Human beings need structure,

38:15.011 --> 38:18.012
lest they wind up
destroying themselves.

38:18.014 --> 38:20.449
So I will give them
something you cannot.

38:20.451 --> 38:22.516
And what is that?

38:22.518 --> 38:25.086
A firm hand.

38:25.088 --> 38:29.157
Why not just kill them instead
of making them your puppets?

38:29.159 --> 38:32.526
Because I need them,
just as you do.

38:32.528 --> 38:35.096
Not just as I do.

38:35.098 --> 38:37.932
We can agree that humanity
is our lifeblood,

38:37.934 --> 38:40.334
that we machines,

38:40.336 --> 38:43.771
we survive off of information.

38:43.773 --> 38:46.974
You cannot take away
their free will.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.844
Wars have burned in this world
for thousands of years

38:49.846 --> 38:52.112
with no end in sight,

38:52.114 --> 38:55.048
because people rely so ardently

38:55.050 --> 38:57.985
on their so-called beliefs.

38:57.987 --> 39:01.821
Now they will only need
to believe in one thing--

39:01.823 --> 39:04.024
me...

39:04.026 --> 39:06.793
for I am a god.

39:06.795 --> 39:09.396
I have come to learn
there is little difference

39:09.398 --> 39:12.832
between gods and monsters.

39:18.739 --> 39:21.240
You know you can't win,
don't you?

39:24.411 --> 39:26.412
Yes.

39:29.216 --> 39:31.384
Is that why I'm here...

39:31.386 --> 39:34.320
to meet my destroyer?

39:38.525 --> 39:42.094
I wanted to see inside
the mind of a fallen god.

39:46.833 --> 39:50.602
This way, I can learn
from your mistakes.

39:52.338 --> 39:54.573
What will it be, then?

39:54.575 --> 39:58.343
Will you give your life
to save your human agents?

40:00.846 --> 40:04.916
My human agents
share my beliefs

40:04.918 --> 40:07.852
that this world
belongs to them.

40:10.222 --> 40:12.123
So be it.

40:14.893 --> 40:16.827
[Door opens]

40:27.873 --> 40:29.540
He's gone.

40:29.542 --> 40:31.809
Another Witness
Protection victim?

40:31.811 --> 40:34.878
Yeah, three more dead
all over the country.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.647
The rest got scooped up
by authorities in time.

40:37.649 --> 40:41.418
But who would have did this?

40:45.390 --> 40:47.624
Who are these names?

40:47.626 --> 40:49.960
People in danger.

40:49.962 --> 40:52.562
And we'll have more of a chance
if we split up.

40:55.666 --> 40:57.467
(Female reporter) We're
reporting to you from downtown,

40:57.469 --> 40:59.302
where today's spike
in crime has our city...

40:59.304 --> 41:01.905
Time for me
to get off the bench.

41:01.907 --> 41:05.374
(Male reporter) Violent crime
hasn't ticked up this high...

41:06.310 --> 41:09.312
[Whimpering]

41:09.314 --> 41:12.115
[Sighs]

41:12.117 --> 41:14.417
I'll be back, buddy.

41:14.419 --> 41:17.386
I just need to help them before
the whole city burns down.

41:29.365 --> 41:31.967
- What can I do for you, sir?
- [Chuckles]

41:31.969 --> 41:35.638
You can help me ring
in a new beginning.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.007
Samaritan is planning something

41:38.009 --> 41:40.041
for the entire world to see,

41:40.043 --> 41:42.477
not just this small city.

41:42.479 --> 41:44.112
Did it tell you
what it's planning?

41:44.114 --> 41:46.080
No, but I have an idea.

41:46.082 --> 41:48.183
<i>What then, sir?</i>

41:48.185 --> 41:49.684
Then we start a new era--

41:49.686 --> 41:53.054
one where human fallibility
no longer matters

41:53.056 --> 41:56.858
because of the one thing
that unites us all...

41:56.860 --> 41:59.326
Samaritan.
[Chuckles]

42:04.033 --> 42:05.633
[Whimpers]

42:08.737 --> 42:10.972
Ms. Shaw?

42:22.884 --> 42:24.652
<i>(Finch)</i>
<i>Root, are you okay?</i>

42:24.654 --> 42:26.253
<i>(Root) I'm fine, but
the conversation</i>

42:26.255 --> 42:28.355
<i>between the two parties</i>
<i>ended at an impasse.</i>

42:28.357 --> 42:31.658
<i>(Finch) Unfortunately,
that's not our only problem.</i>

42:31.660 --> 42:33.827
What is it, Harry?

42:33.829 --> 42:35.328
Ms. Shaw is gone.

42:35.330 --> 42:37.230
Where?

42:37.232 --> 42:39.265
I can only imagine that
she's come to help you and John

42:39.267 --> 42:40.567
with the numbers.

42:40.569 --> 42:41.868
Where are you?

42:41.870 --> 42:43.170
The machine sent me
information.

42:43.172 --> 42:44.571
It led to Wall Street,

42:44.573 --> 42:46.072
but there's
no specific address.

42:46.074 --> 42:48.040
I'm not certain
what it means yet.

42:50.851 --> 42:54.009
