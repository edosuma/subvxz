02:49.070 --> 02:52.910
The bunk 5 boys are gonna freak out
when they see you at kick ball. Let's go.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.390
Ow!

03:19.910 --> 03:22.310
All right, let's go.

03:35.390 --> 03:37.550
Good morning, everybody.

03:37.590 --> 03:39.670
Well, it's the last day of camp...

03:39.710 --> 03:42.590
and it will be sad to shut down
WCFW for the summer.

03:43.070 --> 03:45.950
But not to worry, because those of you in
the Bethesda/Chevy Chase area...

03:46.430 --> 03:50.750
Can hear me all winter long on Jewish Day
School Radio 89.9 F.M...

03:51.230 --> 03:52.670
"The Fox."

03:53.150 --> 03:55.510
For those select few of you
who went all summer,

03:55.550 --> 03:58.430
all eight weeks without finding
that special someone,

03:58.470 --> 04:01.270
today is your day, 'cause you
don't wanna go back home...

04:01.310 --> 04:04.670
and lie to your friends about a summer
romance that didn't even happen.

04:05.150 --> 04:07.030
And you don't want to be
the one person...

04:07.070 --> 04:10.910
who doesn't have anyone to kiss tonight
after the talent show.

04:11.150 --> 04:14.510
So, seize the day, Camp Firewood,
because it's your last.

04:52.190 --> 04:54.590
Coop, do you like watching
me and Andy make out?

04:56.510 --> 04:58.870
No. What a weird thing to say.

04:58.910 --> 05:02.270
- You look so sexy in this sweatshirt.
- Uh-huh.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.150
- Your ass is so hot.
- Stop it!

05:04.190 --> 05:06.350
- Do you want to be my boyfriend?
- No.

05:06.830 --> 05:09.710
I get it. It's very funny. Stop.

05:12.590 --> 05:15.470
Oh, Coop, you know I'm just kidding.

05:15.510 --> 05:18.350
I know, and it's very, very funny.

05:18.390 --> 05:21.190
Okay. I'm sorry.

05:21.230 --> 05:24.550
- Want me to make it up to you?
- No, you've done enough already.

05:24.590 --> 05:28.670
- I'm gonna find you a woman today.
- Honestly, don't worry about it.

05:28.710 --> 05:32.710
No. And I'm not gonna rest until
my mission is accomplished, okay?

05:32.750 --> 05:38.150
Okay. then I'll cancel that
order of onions and Limburger
cheese I made for lunch today.

05:38.190 --> 05:41.750
- Ha-ha.
- Yeah.

05:41.750 --> 05:46.310
- I want you inside me.
- What?

05:46.670 --> 05:48.830
Hey, what's up? I was just...

05:48.950 --> 05:50.390
from before.

05:54.830 --> 05:58.630
Coop, were you just talking to Katie?
What was that?

05:58.670 --> 06:02.990
That was, bar none, the
longest conversation I've had
with her in six years of camp.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.870
Does she want to fuck me? Is that
what she was asking you about?

06:05.910 --> 06:08.230
Because, tell her that I will. In fact...

06:08.270 --> 06:10.630
no, don't tell her that I will.
Tell her that I might.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.070
Victor, I hate to break it to you,
but your name didn't even come up.

06:13.110 --> 06:14.950
She definitely wants to fuck me.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.870
Why else would she be talking to you?

06:18.350 --> 06:20.270
- No offense.
- None taken.

06:22.790 --> 06:24.710
Hello. Hi.

06:25.190 --> 06:27.190
- Uh, hi.
- Hi. I'm Beth.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.150
Nice to meet you. I'm Henry.

06:29.510 --> 06:31.910
I've been seeing you around, so I thought
I'd take a chance...

06:32.390 --> 06:34.430
and introduce myself.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.870
- Thank you.
- So...

06:46.670 --> 06:49.070
So, you work at the camp?

06:49.190 --> 06:51.110
- I'm the camp director.
How about yourself? - Me?

06:51.590 --> 06:54.190
- I don't work over there.
- No, I know.

06:54.230 --> 06:56.750
I'm the director. I would know...

06:56.870 --> 06:59.270
- if you were...
- Right. You would know that.

07:01.550 --> 07:04.430
I teach astrophysics over at the
college in the school year.

07:04.910 --> 07:06.830
And I came here this summer
just to, you know,

07:07.310 --> 07:08.750
relax and reflect.

07:09.230 --> 07:11.870
Wow! You're a professor.
What do you teach?

07:12.350 --> 07:14.270
Well, like I said before, astrophysics.

07:14.750 --> 07:19.550
I study space, stars, comets
and that kind of thing.

07:19.590 --> 07:22.270
"Space...
the final frontier."

07:22.310 --> 07:24.950
Right. Thanks for everything.

07:25.190 --> 07:28.070
Hey! You know what?
It would be a great idea...

07:28.070 --> 07:32.750
if you came by the camp and
taught the campers about space.

07:32.790 --> 07:35.510
- No, I couldn't...
- They'd love it.

07:35.990 --> 07:37.430
No, I couldn't possibly.

07:37.910 --> 07:40.310
- It would be just...
- I said no!

07:40.430 --> 07:42.350
Sorry. that was...

07:56.270 --> 07:59.110
Oh, Coop. Look at Abby.

07:59.150 --> 08:01.070
Oh, she wants to fuck me.
So help me God.

08:01.110 --> 08:03.430
She wants to fuck me.

08:03.470 --> 08:05.390
And this time, Victor, I'm sure it's true.

08:05.870 --> 08:10.190
I have to admit. Abby Bernstein
is one of the only berry bushes...

08:10.230 --> 08:12.550
that I have yet to pollinate,
if you get my meaning.

08:12.590 --> 08:15.470
You mean, she's the only girl at camp
you haven't done it with yet?

08:15.510 --> 08:17.350
That's exactly what I mean.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.790
Hey, Gene. Any mashed potatoes?

08:24.110 --> 08:26.510
Gary! Bring out the taters!

08:28.430 --> 08:30.310
Here they are. Hey, Gary.

08:30.350 --> 08:32.750
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Hey, guys.

08:32.789 --> 08:35.590
What'd you say, shithead?

08:35.630 --> 08:38.950
I said, "hey, guys."
What's your glitz, Gene?

08:38.990 --> 08:42.350
Listen to me, you fucked-up little
cigarette-smoking piece of shit.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.750
I was in the Vietnam war.

08:45.230 --> 08:47.110
- I know.
- Oh, yeah.

08:47.150 --> 08:50.990
The 'Nam.

08:51.110 --> 08:53.030
Excuse me, ladies. You
may remember me...

08:53.510 --> 08:57.350
as the guy who came to dinner a few
weeks ago with underwear on my head.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.350
My name is Keith Stack.

08:59.390 --> 09:03.230
From Millburn, New Jersey.
State bird: The Mosquito.

09:03.350 --> 09:06.230
And as you may have heard,
I am recently...

09:06.270 --> 09:09.590
a crowned class-b Dungeon Master.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.990
So if any of you would like
to play "D & D" today,

09:12.030 --> 09:15.830
please speak now or
forever hold your peace.

09:16.070 --> 09:19.430
Anyone?

09:19.430 --> 09:23.110
Alexa, maybe you'd like to join in?

09:23.150 --> 09:26.030
We do need a druid, and
you have definitely cast...

09:26.070 --> 09:28.470
a level-five charm spell on me.

09:28.470 --> 09:30.830
In your dreams, douche bag.

09:31.310 --> 09:34.190
Douche bags are hygienic products.
I take that as a compliment.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.310
- Thank you.
- Ewww! Ewww!

09:47.870 --> 09:50.270
Well, we made it to the end
of the summer in one piece,

09:50.750 --> 09:53.150
Except for a few campers who are lepers.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.070
Good one, Beth.

09:56.990 --> 09:59.390
Thank you, Gene.

10:04.430 --> 10:09.230
Excuse me. Could you tell me where
I could find the, uh...

10:09.710 --> 10:14.030
How do I put this?
The, uh, sci-fi,

10:14.070 --> 10:16.910
nerdy, indoor kids?

10:17.390 --> 10:19.790
- Bunk 3.
- Oh, yeah. thanks.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.470
Hey, guys.

10:27.950 --> 10:30.350
I'm associate Professor Neumann.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.230
Who'd like to spend the last day at camp
doing science projects?

10:36.110 --> 10:38.750
Okay, okay. Okay, cool.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.630
I've seen more fucked-up shit happen
in five minutes out there...

10:47.670 --> 10:49.990
than you'll see in your whole fucking life.

10:50.030 --> 10:53.630
Gene, I'm really sorry, you know.
If I could change history, I would.

10:53.670 --> 10:57.230
Fuck you! We need to make eight gallons
of bug juice by snack hour.

10:57.270 --> 11:00.110
Do you know where
the powder packets are?

11:00.590 --> 11:03.950
In the pantry over the sink, right
next to my bottle of dick cream!

11:03.990 --> 11:05.870
Wait.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.750
Ignore that last comment.

11:08.790 --> 11:10.670
- Did you say dick cream?
- No.

11:11.150 --> 11:13.070
I said stick team.

11:13.550 --> 11:15.950
You know, stickball? Forget about it.
Go away! Leave me alone.

11:18.350 --> 11:20.270
I'm pretty sure he said
dick cream, but...

11:20.310 --> 11:22.670
Victor.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.510
I need you and Neil to take The Eagles out
on Moose river. I made them a promise.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.390
It's the last day of camp.
It's not gonna work for me.

11:29.430 --> 11:31.270
- It's not gonna work for you?
- No.

11:31.310 --> 11:34.790
It's not gonna work for you. Okay,
how about this as a compromise?

11:34.830 --> 11:37.950
The Eagles are going to
go out on Moose river...

11:37.990 --> 11:41.030
- and you and Neil are
going to take them. - What?

11:41.510 --> 11:43.910
Everybody focus up. All eyes here.

11:43.910 --> 11:46.790
I would like to announce that
Ben and I are planning to
produce a musical number...

11:46.830 --> 11:49.950
from godspell for the talent show tonight.

11:49.990 --> 11:53.030
I'm sorry. Ben is producing, I am
directing/choreographing.

11:53.030 --> 11:55.910
I'm speaking from personal experience,
but if you can't carry a tune...

11:55.950 --> 11:58.310
don't come to the audition
and waste our time.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.710
- We're serious.
- And bring a lot of movement clothes,

12:01.190 --> 12:04.550
A.K.A. jazz shoes,
dance belts, lycras, et al.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.470
and seriously, F.Y.I., you guys,

12:06.470 --> 12:09.350
this is not an excuse to get out
of your regular activities.

12:09.390 --> 12:12.230
This is an excuse to do
some good musical theater.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.630
So, be prepared, be enthusiastic...

12:14.630 --> 12:17.990
and leave your bullshit
attitude and baggage at the
door, 'cause we don't need it!

12:18.030 --> 12:19.910
Hey, you guys!

12:20.270 --> 12:24.590
Oh, I was thinking maybe
we could take a walk later,

12:24.630 --> 12:27.470
maybe go out to Gunner's Pass
one last time.

12:27.950 --> 12:30.310
Goddamn it, Katie! You're suffocating me!

12:30.350 --> 12:32.230
I'm chokin', all right?
Give me some breathing room.

12:32.270 --> 12:36.110
I just want to spend some time with you.
It's our last day at camp.

12:36.150 --> 12:39.270
- My butt itches.
- What are you talking about?

12:39.270 --> 12:42.310
- We're soul mates, right?
- What? Yeah.

12:42.350 --> 12:46.190
Whatever, if you want.
J.J., save me a waffle, man.

12:46.670 --> 12:48.550
Andy, I'm serious. Come on.

12:48.590 --> 12:51.950
I just want it to be special.
Fuck you, dyke!

12:52.430 --> 12:55.310
- Why are you being such an asshole?
- I gotta finish my breakfast.

12:55.350 --> 12:58.670
I love you, baby. So good talking to you.

13:01.070 --> 13:02.990
Yeah, see you in macrame.

13:11.990 --> 13:14.270
One last, successful B.K.F.S.T...

13:14.750 --> 13:17.110
becomes one for the record books.

13:17.150 --> 13:20.030
And with t-minus 11 hours
to the big talent show,

13:20.070 --> 13:22.950
we sail on aboard
the good ship Firewood...

13:22.950 --> 13:25.790
toward a little oasis
that I like to call...

13:25.830 --> 13:29.110
morning activity time.

13:29.150 --> 13:31.030
What's going on with Silas?

13:31.070 --> 13:34.070
You didn't hear? He got kicked
out of camp. - Why?

13:34.070 --> 13:37.790
He snuck into the office and videotaped
himself jerking off. - You're kidding!

13:38.030 --> 13:39.470
- Where's the tape?
- He hid it.

13:39.950 --> 13:44.750
- We gotta get that tape. - It's
a subject matter I'm sure
you're familiar with, McKinley.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.470
- Shut up, J.J.
- You shut up.

13:46.470 --> 13:48.270
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

13:59.030 --> 14:01.910
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

14:02.390 --> 14:05.270
And one, and one.
Step aside. Step aside.

14:17.630 --> 14:19.070
All right. Stop it!

14:21.230 --> 14:25.070
Okay, kids. Um, today
we're going to use...

14:25.110 --> 14:27.950
some crayons...

14:28.310 --> 14:31.190
to make some decorations
for the talent show.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.870
- Is that your wedding ring, Gail?
- Um, no.

14:39.350 --> 14:42.350
I mean, yes, actually.
Yes, it is. It was.

14:42.390 --> 14:45.350
It was. It used to be,
I mean, legally.

14:45.590 --> 14:49.430
It's so twisted. His lawyer
won't even call me now.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.790
- Where are the crayons?
- The crayons are...

14:52.910 --> 14:55.550
the crayon is right there.

14:55.790 --> 14:58.190
We could draw
with the markers.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.070
Listen, Valerie,

15:01.550 --> 15:03.430
I need you to be
helpful here, okay?

15:03.470 --> 15:06.350
I do not need you
to undermine me, okay?

15:06.830 --> 15:09.470
But there's only one crayon,
and it's brown.

15:09.510 --> 15:12.110
There are literally hundreds
of colored markers.

15:25.670 --> 15:27.230
Hey.

15:28.670 --> 15:30.590
Going on your trip?

15:30.710 --> 15:33.110
Yep.

15:33.110 --> 15:35.510
Sucks dick we never got
to know each other.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.670
Yeah.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.470
You got a stick of gum, Victor?

15:39.950 --> 15:41.870
I thought you'd never ask.

15:58.790 --> 16:02.390
Abby! My trip...
it doesn't come back until tomorrow.

16:02.430 --> 16:05.270
- Don't go.
- I can't, because Beth told me...

16:08.270 --> 16:10.630
Let's go.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.750
♪ Get ready get set, baby ♪
I'll be back tonight.

16:14.870 --> 16:17.270
♪ Leaving tomorrow
so get ready ♪

16:17.750 --> 16:21.590
♪ Get ready get set, baby ♪
Tonight.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.510
Ah!

16:23.510 --> 16:27.350
This is "The Beekeeper" here
on Camp Firewood radio.

16:27.350 --> 16:31.790
I've got my drones working hard
on a breakfast time rock... Hey.

16:31.830 --> 16:35.630
- Arty, I need you to take a shower.
- Okay.

16:36.110 --> 16:38.990
Your parents are coming tomorrow.
I don't want to get in trouble.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.870
- Sure. - You haven't taken a
shower once yet this summer.

16:41.910 --> 16:45.710
- Fine. No problem.
- Arty, take a shower.

16:46.190 --> 16:48.110
You're covered in dirt.

16:48.150 --> 16:50.030
Fine.

16:51.950 --> 16:54.230
This is Arty Solomon here.

16:54.270 --> 16:56.470
Alias, "The Beekeeper."

16:56.510 --> 17:01.310
- You guys,
I'm really gonna miss this place. - Me too.

17:01.550 --> 17:06.829
Hey, let's all promise that in ten years
from today we'll meet again...

17:06.869 --> 17:08.510
and we'll see what kind of people
we've blossomed into.

17:08.550 --> 17:11.349
- Yeah!
- What time you wanna meet?

17:11.390 --> 17:13.790
- You mean ten years from now?
- Yeah.

17:14.030 --> 17:15.950
Let's meet in the morning
so we can make a day of it.

17:15.990 --> 17:18.630
Okay, so what is it?
Is it like 9:00 or 9:30?

17:18.630 --> 17:21.230
Let's say 9:00, that way
we can be here by 9:30.

17:21.270 --> 17:23.510
Why don't we say 9:30,

17:23.510 --> 17:25.910
and then make it your
beeswax to be here at 9:30?

17:26.390 --> 17:30.230
We're gonna be in our late
20's. I don't see any reason
we can't be places on time.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.230
Okay, it's settled.
9:30 it is.

17:33.270 --> 17:36.070
- All agreed?
- Agreed.

17:36.110 --> 17:38.950
Great, 'cause I have
something at 11:00.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.830
You've got a trapper keeper
full of appointments, right?

17:41.870 --> 17:45.230
No, I have something at 11:00 that I can't
change 'cause I already moved it twice.

17:49.190 --> 17:51.110
What are you looking at?

17:51.110 --> 17:53.990
Is there a U.F.O. in the sky?

17:53.990 --> 17:57.830
No, no. It's nothing
you need worry about...

18:01.190 --> 18:03.590
Yet.

18:09.710 --> 18:13.550
Andy? Are you
gonna clean that up?

18:13.590 --> 18:15.910
Oh, yeah, I will.

18:15.950 --> 18:19.270
Uh, I just got...
I don't have time now.

18:19.310 --> 18:22.310
Clean it up and come
to my office for the meeting.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.710
I gotta...

18:52.670 --> 18:54.590
Damn!

19:12.950 --> 19:16.790
- Gail, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

19:18.710 --> 19:21.590
It's just that
my husband Ron...

19:21.630 --> 19:24.030
You know...
no, he's my ex-husband.

19:24.070 --> 19:26.390
I guess I have
to get used to that.

19:26.870 --> 19:29.270
I have to get used
to saying ex, ex, ex.

19:29.630 --> 19:32.870
He's my ex, ex-husband.

19:32.870 --> 19:37.190
You know, it's just
that I thought, like...

19:37.670 --> 19:40.550
when Jonas and I separated,
I thought everything was lost.

19:40.590 --> 19:42.230
And then I met Ron...

19:42.230 --> 19:47.510
and it just seemed like everything
was gonna work out, you know?

19:47.630 --> 19:51.230
Keep going. We're with you.
I'm a total wreck! I don't even
know where the crayons are.

19:51.590 --> 19:55.910
- I know, I know. Gail, listen to me.
- I'm a loser. What?

19:55.950 --> 20:00.230
- Ron's who he is and you
can't change that. - I know.

20:00.270 --> 20:02.150
Okay?

20:02.150 --> 20:04.790
- Gail, listen to me. Look at me.
- I am.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.430
Gail, look at me.
Gail, look at me.

20:07.910 --> 20:09.830
I want you to say "okay."

20:11.270 --> 20:13.190
- Why?
- I want you to say "okay."

20:15.110 --> 20:17.990
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

20:17.990 --> 20:20.150
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank you all...

20:20.190 --> 20:22.070
for making
the last eight weeks,

20:22.550 --> 20:24.950
without rival, the best summer
of my entire life.

20:27.230 --> 20:29.110
Okay, let's get to business.

20:29.150 --> 20:32.030
Coop, the camp goat
took a shit in the infirmary.

20:32.510 --> 20:34.430
- I need you to take care of that, please.
- That's impossible!

20:34.470 --> 20:38.230
It is possible, and it happened...
on my shoes.

20:38.270 --> 20:41.630
Abby, bunk 8 wants to watch The China
Syndrome again, so run the betamax.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.950
- Again?
- What can I say? They love it. McKinley.

20:44.990 --> 20:48.710
Four lower campers are stuck in the ropes
course. I meant to tell you yesterday.

20:49.070 --> 20:51.950
Could you get to it now?
And last, but certainly not least,

20:52.430 --> 20:54.710
tonight is the big talent show.

20:55.070 --> 20:57.470
We have a lot of hard work ahead of us.
A few ground rules...

20:57.830 --> 21:00.230
Hey. Hey!

21:00.710 --> 21:03.590
I'm serious here.
I am not joking around.

21:04.070 --> 21:07.430
I am not jok... I am not
Ruth Buzzi standing here.

21:07.470 --> 21:10.190
I am no Ruth Buzzi standing here!

21:14.870 --> 21:17.630
Steve? What you got there?

21:18.830 --> 21:21.710
I have been programmed...

21:21.750 --> 21:23.590
by my galactic master...

21:23.630 --> 21:25.550
not to talk
to earth denizens...

21:25.790 --> 21:29.630
of classifications J.J.
and McKinley-I-zoid.

21:33.830 --> 21:37.190
- Your brother is such a freak.
- I know.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.590
Katie, you're hot, right?

21:40.070 --> 21:43.910
By all accounts, you would be considered
"hot." Is that correct?

21:43.950 --> 21:45.830
Uh, I suppose so.

21:46.310 --> 21:51.590
So if one wanted to be hot and make
a good impression, what would you wear?

21:51.630 --> 21:53.990
You put on a clean pair of pants?

21:54.470 --> 21:57.350
Beth, come on. Pants?
Are you kidding?

21:57.830 --> 21:59.750
Yes. Pants.

21:59.790 --> 22:01.670
Of course I'm kidding.

22:01.670 --> 22:04.550
You didn't get I'm kidding?
Unless you're kidding.

22:04.590 --> 22:08.870
'cause pants, Katie.
Come on, please. Pants.

22:08.910 --> 22:11.270
So would you... slacks? Pants?

22:11.750 --> 22:14.630
I don't know. I think I'd wear
a sexy dress or something.

22:15.110 --> 22:17.030
That? Oh, you're good.
Sexy dress.

22:17.070 --> 22:19.910
Okay. Uh, that's "a."

22:19.910 --> 22:24.230
Um, what else... what else
would one do if one were...

22:24.270 --> 22:27.110
I'd do my hair.
Oh, get out of town!

22:27.110 --> 22:30.950
I'm not getting out of town, and I'm
serious. And I'd use a little mousse.

22:31.430 --> 22:34.790
Moose, as in...

22:35.270 --> 22:37.910
No, as "mousse" for your hair.
Right! Right!

22:38.270 --> 22:41.150
- Okay. Wait a minute, Beth. Are you...
- What?

22:41.390 --> 22:43.310
Huh? What's up?

22:43.670 --> 22:47.030
You dog! You have
a crush on somebody!

22:47.030 --> 22:51.230
- I do have a crush. I just don't
believe he's interested. - What?

22:51.270 --> 22:55.430
Beth, do not worry. Come with me
and I will mousse you up.

23:00.950 --> 23:04.190
Hey, Andy, can I take out the
motorboat and drive around the lake?

23:04.310 --> 23:08.030
- Sure.
- Wow! Thanks.

23:08.510 --> 23:12.830
Just make sure you fill it up with gas
when you're done, and watch out...

23:12.870 --> 23:14.750
Yeah, whatever.

23:21.470 --> 23:24.350
Man, I'd give anything for two
minutes in the closet with Lindsay.

23:27.230 --> 23:29.630
- What about Katie?
- Who?

23:30.110 --> 23:32.030
Excellent.

23:44.270 --> 23:47.150
Hey. Whatcha writin' on?

23:47.190 --> 23:49.030
My "gurnal."

23:49.070 --> 23:51.470
I write my thoughts in it every day.

23:51.510 --> 23:54.350
Oh, you mean a journal.

23:54.390 --> 23:56.230
Yeah, whatever.

23:56.270 --> 23:58.670
Guess I'm not all smart like you.

23:58.710 --> 24:01.030
Can I see what you're writing?

24:01.070 --> 24:05.390
Only three people are allowed to
look at this... Me, myself and I.

24:05.430 --> 24:07.310
But I want you to share it with me.

24:10.190 --> 24:12.110
Hey!

24:15.710 --> 24:18.590
Let's see. Debbie Waxman?

24:19.070 --> 24:22.430
No. she makes that weird piggy
face when she talks, you know?

24:22.470 --> 24:26.270
Yeah. okay, good. No piggy face.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.550
- Rachel Schwartz.
- No.

24:30.590 --> 24:33.470
- Come on, she's a slut. She'll go.
- I'll pass.

24:33.510 --> 24:36.310
- Yeah, you're not really a slut type.
- Yes, I am.

24:36.350 --> 24:40.190
I love sluts. Sluts rock.
It's just gotta be the right slut.

24:40.550 --> 24:42.470
What about Susie?

24:44.270 --> 24:47.110
Yeah. I could go for Susie.

24:47.150 --> 24:49.310
She and I went out
my first summer here.

24:49.350 --> 24:51.470
- When you were ten?
- Yeah, we were ten,

24:51.590 --> 24:53.510
But we were into
some heavy shit.

24:53.990 --> 24:55.550
Did you go all the way?

24:56.030 --> 24:58.910
You bet we went all the way.
We went all the way back too.

24:58.950 --> 25:01.270
We did doggy style, pony style.

25:01.310 --> 25:05.030
Style council. That's a good band.
They're hot now. Human league.

25:05.070 --> 25:07.430
They have some good stuff.

25:07.430 --> 25:10.790
League of nations. That brings in
the whole thing of united nations.

25:11.030 --> 25:13.430
That brings in the whole
category of countries.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.790
Where to start?
Well, the obvious one.

25:16.790 --> 25:21.110
The birthplace of spaghetti and
pasta, all the oily stuff... Italy.

25:21.350 --> 25:23.750
- Now you go.
- Um...

25:24.230 --> 25:27.110
- How about Italy?
- Yeah, good! It's safe.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.990
I kind of paved the way
with that one, but...

25:33.350 --> 25:34.790
What?

25:35.270 --> 25:37.190
- What?
- Hey, guys.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.670
- Hi, Nancy.
- Hi, Katie.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.590
Coop, goat shit.

25:49.910 --> 25:51.830
Whoo-hoo! Ow!

26:00.590 --> 26:02.990
Andy! Help me!

26:03.110 --> 26:05.030
- You french great.
- Andy!

26:05.510 --> 26:09.350
- You're not so bad yourself, Mr. Man.
- Andy, help me!

26:09.390 --> 26:13.190
- I can't swim!
- Cut it out, bobby. You're fine.

26:13.230 --> 26:16.430
For chrissake, Andy,
help me, I'm drowning.

26:21.950 --> 26:25.310
No, you can't hear the ocean, but you
can learn a great deal about our world.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.750
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Beth.

26:29.790 --> 26:32.710
Like the new look. Tres chic.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.630
- Thank you, Henry.
- Please, call me Henry.

26:35.670 --> 26:37.550
Okay, Henry it is.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.910
I see you decided to come
teach the campers, Henry.

26:40.950 --> 26:43.790
Yeah. I'm sorry
I snapped at you before.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.110
I'm a little shy around children.
But it's been great!

26:47.150 --> 26:50.030
I've got them making miniature
black holes with paper clips and soot.

26:50.070 --> 26:52.870
What you do
is so fascinating!

26:52.910 --> 26:56.750
- You really like astrophysics? - I love it!
It's my biggest hobby. I love it.

26:56.790 --> 27:01.550
Really? Okay. Who's your
favorite astrophysicist?

27:01.590 --> 27:04.910
My fav... I totally know this one.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.830
Okay, any...

27:11.150 --> 27:13.550
- What time is it?
- Um...

27:13.590 --> 27:15.430
9:00, 9:30.

27:15.470 --> 27:19.310
I'm so late. I have to go
meet Jim... Stansel.

27:19.350 --> 27:22.190
- You know Jim? He's that guy.
- Uh-huh.

27:22.670 --> 27:25.550
- So I'll talk to you later. Okay?
- Okay.

27:25.590 --> 27:28.430
Okay. Okay. Later, then.

27:32.870 --> 27:35.750
Andy, have you seen
my swimming buddy?

27:35.790 --> 27:37.670
Um...
if I can't find him,

27:37.670 --> 27:40.070
I'm telling Beth
that you let him drown.

27:40.550 --> 27:43.910
- I was busy. - It's your job to
make sure kids don't drown.

27:43.950 --> 27:45.830
Lindsay, I need like
20 minutes, all right?

27:46.310 --> 27:48.710
Gotta talk to this kid.

27:49.190 --> 27:51.110
Andy, where are we going?

27:51.590 --> 27:53.030
To a big, secret pizza party.

27:53.510 --> 27:55.790
Wow! Cool. I love pizza.

27:55.830 --> 27:58.670
Yeah, well...

28:03.830 --> 28:06.230
Nancy! Hello.

28:06.350 --> 28:10.550
If I was looking for a book on
astrophysics, where would I find one?

28:10.910 --> 28:13.790
Off the top of my head,
I'd have to say a bookstore.

28:13.910 --> 28:16.310
- Or a library.
- Right.

28:16.310 --> 28:18.230
Just curious. Keep up the good work.

28:18.470 --> 28:19.910
Okay.

28:22.430 --> 28:24.790
Excuse me. Uh, Nancy.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.110
Say I wanted to get a book on, um...

28:27.470 --> 28:29.390
What?

28:29.870 --> 28:33.230
- Camp directing, I guess. Would that be...
- Henry.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.870
Henry! Library.

28:36.350 --> 28:40.270
Ooh. Thank you!

28:40.310 --> 28:44.150
Beth! Beth!

28:44.510 --> 28:47.510
If you're going into town, can you pick
me up something at the drugstore?

28:47.630 --> 28:51.710
Beth, come on. My husband's coming
today and I need some lube.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.630
For my pussy.

28:56.990 --> 28:58.870
Oh, cool!

28:58.910 --> 29:02.270
Beth's going into town.
Let's go! Wait, wait!

29:06.350 --> 29:08.870
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

29:08.990 --> 29:11.390
Come on, Coop!
Come on!

29:18.350 --> 29:19.790

Hey, guys,
how was Waterville?

31:00.110 --> 31:02.510
- It was really fun. - It's always fun
to get away from camp,

31:02.990 --> 31:04.910
even for an hour.

31:06.350 --> 31:08.990
Katie!
I'll see you later maybe?

31:09.030 --> 31:11.630
Definitely.

31:14.630 --> 31:16.550
Guys, wait up!

31:24.350 --> 31:26.230
How far away
is this goddamn river?

31:26.270 --> 31:29.630
It's at least two hours, Vic.
Try to forget about Abby.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.510
I can't, Neil, okay?
This is my only chance.

31:32.990 --> 31:34.430
What are you talking about?

31:34.910 --> 31:37.310
I'm gonna tell you something, but I
swear to God, if you tell anybody...

31:37.790 --> 31:40.910
- I swear to God!
- What? Wha...

31:43.790 --> 31:46.670
- I'm a virgin.
- Wha...

31:47.150 --> 31:49.510
You're joking.
Right, dude?

31:49.550 --> 31:53.390
You're the stallion. You've had
like 50 or 60 women, so I mean...

31:53.430 --> 31:57.230
Actually, it's closer to... zero.

31:58.670 --> 32:01.030
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

32:01.070 --> 32:02.990
You're a loser.
You are a loser!

32:03.030 --> 32:05.670
Oh, my God. Don't. I...

32:05.670 --> 32:08.270
you're such a loser.

32:17.110 --> 32:19.470
- What?
- What?

32:19.510 --> 32:21.430
You listen to me,
Mr. Kickass.

32:21.910 --> 32:23.830
Mr. Rubber Burner.

32:23.830 --> 32:26.230
You wipe that hotshot grin off
your face or I'll shoot it off you.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.630
You got that? Now finish up them taters.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.270
- I'm gonna go fondle my sweaters.
- Come on. What?

32:31.310 --> 32:33.430
- Finish up the taters.
- Then what did you say?

32:33.430 --> 32:36.310
- Then what did I say? - You said you
were gonna go fondle your sweaters.

32:36.790 --> 32:39.190
I... no, I didn't.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.110
I said I'm gonna
fondue with cheddar.

32:41.110 --> 32:43.510
I was thinking about making fondue with
cheddar cheese for dinner tonight.

32:43.550 --> 32:47.470
- No, Gene, that is not what you said.
- It is what I said.

32:47.510 --> 32:49.870
Fondue with cheddar.

32:49.910 --> 32:51.790
Okay, fine.

32:55.150 --> 32:57.190
Okay, see you later.

32:57.230 --> 33:00.030
See ya.

33:00.070 --> 33:02.950
I'm just gonna stop by
my bunk for a real quick sec.

33:05.830 --> 33:08.230
Maybe you should talk to him.

33:08.350 --> 33:13.150
So rabbi Rothstein says, "sim, sim,
sim, sim, ata..."

33:13.630 --> 33:15.510
Hey, McKinley.

33:15.550 --> 33:18.430
- Did you take that shower yet?
- Yeah, of course.

33:18.470 --> 33:20.870
- Did you?
- No.

33:20.870 --> 33:23.230
Take a shower.

33:25.630 --> 33:28.510
Sorry, folks for the
"coitus interuptus," if you will.

33:28.630 --> 33:31.030
I know you're all hungry
for the picnic,

33:31.030 --> 33:33.430
so don't eat too many
barbecued bovine muscles.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.830
Those being hamburgers.
Thank you.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.790
Gail, if I could just
interject something here.

33:42.910 --> 33:46.990
This is gonna sound like
I'm putting down my own gender,

33:47.030 --> 33:51.070
but the truth is, a lot of the time
men can be real...

33:51.110 --> 33:53.950
and excuse the Yiddish...
insensitive schmucks.

33:54.190 --> 33:56.590
- It's true.
- I know.

33:57.070 --> 34:00.910
I know. It's just that
I'm 34 years old.

34:01.270 --> 34:02.710
You know?

34:02.710 --> 34:06.070
I'm just afraid I'm never
gonna meet anybody.

34:06.550 --> 34:08.469
- Shh. Just breathe. Shh.
- It's so sad.

34:10.389 --> 34:14.230
Breathe. Shh.
Just breathe.

34:14.270 --> 34:16.909
Oh, God!

34:16.949 --> 34:19.510
Your hands are magic.

34:19.630 --> 34:22.510
- There you go.
- You, my friend, are a magician.

34:27.909 --> 34:29.790
Okay!

34:29.830 --> 34:33.190
Everyone! Immediately!
Out of the van.

34:33.230 --> 34:35.590
Get out of the van.
Out. Out.

34:37.030 --> 34:38.469
- What are you doing?
- I'm going back to camp.

34:38.949 --> 34:41.790
- I'll come back in the morning and
pick you up. - Wait a second.

34:41.830 --> 34:45.909
- What, Neil? - Wait a minute.
You can't get there and back by sunup.

34:46.389 --> 34:49.750
I am going to be with Abby
Bernstein tonight. And if you
don't like it, you know what?

34:49.790 --> 34:53.110
You could just go ahead
and fuck yourself!

34:53.150 --> 34:54.790
Hey!

34:58.390 --> 35:01.870
You're making a big mistake,

Guys, I'm gonna catch up
with you later, okay?

38:34.510 --> 38:36.390
Dude, that's kind of sad.

38:36.430 --> 38:39.790
He gets so uncomfortable whenever
we talk openly about sexual issues.

38:39.830 --> 38:42.150
You know, he's never
been with a girl before.

38:42.190 --> 38:44.470
McKinley needs
to experience the ultimate.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.030
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

38:46.510 --> 38:48.430
You mean penis in vagina?

38:48.470 --> 38:50.790
No, dickhead. Sex.

38:50.830 --> 38:53.710
Oh, oh, oh.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.150
They're total
nymphos! Throw the ball!

38:58.190 --> 39:00.510
Yes!

39:00.550 --> 39:04.270
I'm sure we can convince one of the
girls from bunk 10 to boink McKinley.

39:04.750 --> 39:07.110
They're really horny this summer.

39:07.150 --> 39:09.670
Where did he go, anyway?
- I don't know.

39:10.150 --> 39:12.550
- Probably went to write his mommy
and daddy a letter. - What a fag!

39:12.590 --> 39:15.430
- Who are we gonna set him up with?
- How about Debbie?

39:15.470 --> 39:17.390
- No, she's got mono.
- Right.

39:17.430 --> 39:19.230
- How about Debbie?
- Who?

39:19.270 --> 39:23.110
- You know, Debbie Debbie.
- Oh, Debbie Debbie. No, she's his cousin.

39:23.150 --> 39:26.950
- How about tall Debbie?
- Too tall.

39:27.190 --> 39:30.550
How about Debbie
freeman? She's in heat!

39:31.030 --> 39:33.910
- She wants to french. - No, you
shithead. She wants to get boned.

39:33.950 --> 39:36.630
- Then I want her.
- You're being ridiculous.

39:36.670 --> 39:39.070
I'm not being ridiculous!
I'm just saying I want her.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.950
This isn't about you.
This is about McKinley.

39:40.990 --> 39:44.830
Haven't you been listening to
what we've been saying? We're
trying to get our friend laid.

39:44.870 --> 39:49.150
- Ah! point taken.
- Okay. Tonight...

39:49.630 --> 39:52.030
- Get McKinley laid.
- Come hell or high water?

39:52.070 --> 39:53.910
Secret handshake?

39:53.950 --> 39:56.350
Get McKinley laid!

40:17.830 --> 40:19.270
As everybody knows,

40:19.750 --> 40:24.190
today is the big culminating,
climactic softball game...

40:24.230 --> 40:27.550
- against evil Camp Tiger Claw.
- Boo!

40:28.030 --> 40:29.950
We have put together
an unlikely...

40:30.190 --> 40:33.550
team of misfits, and we've been
training like crazy all summer.

40:34.030 --> 40:36.430
Yeah, it's a motley crew
that you'd think...

40:36.910 --> 40:38.350
would never be able
to win a single game.

40:38.830 --> 40:41.710
We had a kooky training period
where it seemed like...

40:41.750 --> 40:44.590
it seemed like nothing was
gonna go right. But, guys,

40:44.710 --> 40:46.590
somehow we made it
to the finals.

40:46.630 --> 40:50.830
So I say, when those anonymously
evil campers from Tiger Claw get here,

40:51.310 --> 40:54.670
we give it our best shot, and we try to
come from behind at the last minute...

40:54.710 --> 40:57.550
with some weird trick play that we
made up and we win the game.

40:57.590 --> 40:59.950
What do you say, team?

41:00.190 --> 41:01.630
It sounds like
well-worn territory.

41:02.110 --> 41:04.030
The whole thing feels kind of
trite. I say we forget it.

41:04.270 --> 41:06.670
- Is that how everybody feels?
- Yeah.

41:06.710 --> 41:08.350
Well, it's fine with me.

41:19.390 --> 41:22.750
So listen, they just
aren't into it. It's kind of trite.

41:22.790 --> 41:25.150
Yeah, you're right. No problem, man.

41:25.190 --> 41:28.030
It's sort of hackneyed. Tried
and done before.

41:28.070 --> 41:29.950
See you later, man.

41:33.790 --> 41:36.190
It's no big deal.
they were totally cool.

41:36.230 --> 41:38.110
Okay? All right.

41:44.590 --> 41:47.470
Susie is gonna score
with McKinley.

41:47.950 --> 41:50.350
Then he's gonna need some
eyewitnesses for verification.

41:50.470 --> 41:51.910
Let's go!

41:58.030 --> 42:01.710
Why does she still
have her clothes on?

42:01.750 --> 42:05.350
- Looks like she's playing the flute.
- Oh, wow. kinky.

42:09.790 --> 42:12.150
As bared witness
by myself,

42:12.190 --> 42:16.510
All of Camp Firewood and the higher
power, however you define it,

42:16.870 --> 42:19.750
I hereby consecrate
and sanctify the union...

42:19.990 --> 42:22.350
of McKinley and Ben.

42:22.390 --> 42:25.510
May their majestic
and blessed love...

42:25.550 --> 42:28.630
flourish all the days
of their lives.

42:30.070 --> 42:31.990
- Amen.
- Amen.

42:32.230 --> 42:33.790
Amen.

42:37.510 --> 42:39.910
McKinley's a fag.

42:40.390 --> 42:43.750
- McKinley's a fag with Ben!
- What are we gonna do?

42:44.990 --> 42:47.190
Capture the flag!

42:59.310 --> 43:02.190
Hey, aren't you
gonna eat anything?

43:02.670 --> 43:04.110
I'm not hungry.

43:06.510 --> 43:09.870
So, you haven't made many
friends this summer, have you?

43:09.910 --> 43:12.230
No, I have not.

43:12.270 --> 43:15.990
- Let's drop the robot voice, shall we?
- Okay.

43:16.350 --> 43:19.830
- This your first summer here?
- Fifth. You were my counselor...

43:19.950 --> 43:21.830
- three times.
- Now I'm the camp director.

43:21.870 --> 43:25.230
If there's anything I can do to make your
last day more enjoyable, let me know.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.110
Really?

43:27.150 --> 43:30.510
I have an idea. How about
whatever you've been working
on is your talent tonight?

43:30.550 --> 43:33.350
That way, the other campers
can get to know you.

43:33.390 --> 43:37.110
- It's not a song or anything. - It's
okay. I'll have Susie put you on the list.

43:37.590 --> 43:39.990
Oh, God! Thank you!

43:41.430 --> 43:44.190
- How was the waterfront this morning?
- It was good.

43:44.670 --> 43:47.430
We gonna get a chance
to spend time together?

43:47.470 --> 43:50.190
Are you gonna pound this
into my face all day?

43:50.230 --> 43:52.550
Sorry.

43:52.590 --> 43:55.430
Apology accepted.

43:55.470 --> 43:58.830
Guess what. A bunch of us went into town
and got ice cream and hamburgers...

43:58.870 --> 44:00.750
It smells like the ribs are ready.

44:05.070 --> 44:08.630
Beth, I may regret saying this,

44:08.670 --> 44:13.470
- but how dare you usurp my authority
as producer... - Hmpf!

44:13.510 --> 44:15.390
Director/choreographer
of the talent show?

44:15.870 --> 44:18.270
You were wrong
to do that!

44:18.390 --> 44:20.750
I have been busting
my balls, woman!

44:20.790 --> 44:23.670
I am telling you,
the musical numbers are a mess,

44:24.150 --> 44:26.510
my kids are a bunch
of amateurs,

44:26.550 --> 44:29.670
and the last thing I need today
is some diabetic freak...

44:29.710 --> 44:32.790
prancing around on stage
making my life a living hell!

44:34.710 --> 44:37.230
All right, I'll put him last.

44:37.470 --> 44:39.390
Good.

44:39.870 --> 44:41.790
Oh, she always wins!

44:43.710 --> 44:46.590
Don't pick it up, stupid!

44:46.630 --> 44:49.310
Stop picking it up!

44:49.350 --> 44:51.950
You see? this is us,

44:51.990 --> 44:57.270
and we're traveling
around the sun.

44:57.750 --> 45:03.030
That's a 1.3 million mile trip
every year!

45:03.070 --> 45:05.390
Radical.

45:05.430 --> 45:08.790
You might say that
each and every one of us...

45:08.830 --> 45:12.150
is a crew member here
on spaceship earth.

45:12.630 --> 45:15.030
- When would we say that?
- Any time.

45:15.070 --> 45:17.870
Dinner. Literally any time.

45:17.910 --> 45:21.630
You're amazing. I hope I can come to your
college and you can be my professor.

45:21.670 --> 45:24.950
Actually, I, uh...

45:24.990 --> 45:28.350
I'm just an associate professor.

45:28.590 --> 45:30.510
- What does that mean?
- Melvyn!

45:30.550 --> 45:32.430
No, no, it's all right.

45:32.670 --> 45:34.830
it means, Melvyn...

45:34.870 --> 45:36.990
It means that I'm...

45:40.830 --> 45:42.750
less than.

45:49.950 --> 45:51.870
Oh, God!

45:55.350 --> 45:57.750
Hey! What's goin' on?

45:59.310 --> 46:01.710
Hey, Beth. We're just
having ourselves a little cry.

46:06.270 --> 46:08.150
I know what
this group needs.

46:08.190 --> 46:11.070
How 'bout we grab some lunch and
watch the "capture the flag" game?

46:11.110 --> 46:14.790
- What do you say?
- I think we'll take a rain check, Beth.

46:15.270 --> 46:19.110
- We're in the middle of some pretty
interesting stuff. - I'll make you a deal.

46:19.470 --> 46:21.830
You come watch the "capture the
flag game" with the normal kids,

46:21.870 --> 46:25.230
and then you can have the whole rest
of the day to learn about planets, stars,

46:25.710 --> 46:28.590
pulsars, heliocentricity,
gravitational collapse...

46:28.950 --> 46:30.350
and the science
of celestial mechanics...

46:30.390 --> 46:33.270
as shown through the work of
the 19th century scientists...

46:33.310 --> 46:37.590
Alexis Clairaut, Jean d'Alembert
and Pierre Laplace.

46:37.630 --> 46:40.230
- Okay? Ready?
- Okay!

46:40.590 --> 46:43.110
Break!

46:45.990 --> 46:49.830
Gee, I was really impressed by some
of the stuff you said back there.

46:49.870 --> 46:54.110
- Oh, it was... - No, Beth, you
know what you're talking about.

46:54.150 --> 46:56.070
I don't know where you find the
time to learn about astrophysics.

46:56.550 --> 46:59.910
I mean, with camp payroll
and insurance to deal with.

47:00.390 --> 47:03.270
Keeping parents happy,
supervising a young staff.

47:03.310 --> 47:06.110
- Keeping everyone fed.
- Wow.

47:06.150 --> 47:09.990
It was in 1908 that the first
American summer camps
were founded in the Catskills.

47:13.110 --> 47:15.990
- Is there any more corn?
- What?

47:16.470 --> 47:19.350
- More corn.
- Oh, dude.

47:19.390 --> 47:22.230
- You got...
- What, dude?

47:22.350 --> 47:24.750
What? What are you doing
with your hand?

47:24.790 --> 47:27.230
On your face. You, uh...

47:27.270 --> 47:30.110
Cat got your tongue, Andy?
What is it?

47:30.150 --> 47:32.790
You have barbecue sauce
all over your face.

47:32.910 --> 47:35.790
- I know that. So?
- It's pretty foul.

47:36.150 --> 47:41.430
It's just barbecue sauce.
Come on. I wanna make out.

47:43.830 --> 47:45.750
Okay, but not here.

47:51.990 --> 47:54.350
What's it like being a professor?

47:54.390 --> 47:59.190
- What do they say, "publish or perish"?
- Well, perish mostly.

47:59.230 --> 48:01.590
I'm up for tenure
this fall.

48:02.070 --> 48:04.470
If I don't make my mark soon,
I could end up out of work.

48:04.950 --> 48:07.350
But you're so talented!

48:07.830 --> 48:09.750
Tell that to my dean.

48:11.190 --> 48:14.550
Okay. Okay, what's his address?

48:14.590 --> 48:17.390
You serious?
56 Linden Lane.

48:17.430 --> 48:20.870
- Okay. City?
- God, you're really... Augusta.

48:20.910 --> 48:23.790
- State? - I can't believe...
well, Maine, of course.

48:24.270 --> 48:28.070
- ZIP?
- This is... 04139.

48:28.110 --> 48:30.510
- Does he have an apartment number?
- No!

48:30.990 --> 48:35.310
Beth, this is incredible. I don't
know how to thank you.

48:35.350 --> 48:38.670
You already have, Henry.
You already have.

48:47.430 --> 48:50.790
This is crazy.
This is crazy.

49:52.750 --> 49:55.150
That's it, Lars.

49:55.630 --> 49:57.550
Good. Keep your feet together.

49:57.590 --> 49:59.110
You got it. Good.

50:02.230 --> 50:04.110
Aah!

50:04.150 --> 50:07.630
You taste like a burger.
I don't like you anymore.

50:09.790 --> 50:11.230
Whatever!

50:16.030 --> 50:18.750
Damn it!

50:18.790 --> 50:21.310
Is it my turn yet?

50:32.110 --> 50:35.470
So, this is where I come
when I want to think.

50:35.510 --> 50:37.390
Wow!

50:37.870 --> 50:40.270
It's very...

50:40.310 --> 50:42.670
Barn-like.

50:46.990 --> 50:49.350
You know, it's weird, Coop.

50:49.390 --> 50:52.750
I was supposed to be in the woods
with Andy this afternoon, but...

50:52.790 --> 50:57.070
Oh. I'm sorry. We can go back.
We should go back.

50:57.110 --> 51:00.430
No, no! It's okay.
I can see him later.

51:06.190 --> 51:09.070
Give me your hand.

51:13.990 --> 51:15.870
It's cold.

51:15.910 --> 51:18.790
Yeah. I'm freezing.

51:19.270 --> 51:20.710
Do you want
my sweatshirt?

51:20.750 --> 51:22.990
Do you mind?

51:37.870 --> 51:41.710
Okay, Coop, now I'm colder than
I was before when I said I was cold.

51:43.150 --> 51:45.550
Well, do you want my flannel?

51:46.990 --> 51:49.390
Yeah.

51:57.670 --> 52:01.510
This is cool! It's really a
great shirt. I love it.

52:01.550 --> 52:04.390
It's my favorite shirt.

52:04.870 --> 52:07.750
So... you're gonna have
to give it back.

52:07.790 --> 52:09.670
Now?

52:10.150 --> 52:12.070
Yeah.

52:20.230 --> 52:22.590
What are we doing?

52:22.630 --> 52:25.990
- Do you mean like switching our shirts?
- No.

52:26.470 --> 52:28.870
What are we doing?

52:28.910 --> 52:30.790
I don't know.

52:49.150 --> 52:52.870
Okay, so I'm Ron and I'm calling you.
Here we go. Ring, ring.

52:53.230 --> 52:55.150
Hello?
Hi, Gail.

52:55.190 --> 52:57.030
It's me, Ron.

52:57.070 --> 53:01.350
Hi, Ron. What do
you want? Um, well...

53:01.390 --> 53:05.710
I'm ready to give our marriage
another shot. What do you say?

53:07.150 --> 53:09.550
Um...

53:09.670 --> 53:11.590
Be strong, Gail!

53:11.710 --> 53:15.790
- No.
- No, Ron, it's over.

53:15.830 --> 53:19.870
Good-bye.

53:27.550 --> 53:29.950
Hi, mom. Could you get dad?

53:29.990 --> 53:32.310
Just get him.

53:32.350 --> 53:36.190
Hi, dad. Okay, are you
guys sitting down?

53:36.670 --> 53:39.550
I met somebody. Well, she's got
this other boyfriend,

53:39.590 --> 53:41.950
but, well, it's just a matter
of time, I think.

53:44.470 --> 53:46.870
Her name is Katie,
and she's really great.

53:46.910 --> 53:49.710
And, um... what?
I don't think so.

53:49.750 --> 53:52.590
She might be.
She's got a pretty big nose.

53:52.630 --> 53:55.510
Well, I know how you guys worry that
I have trouble meeting girls.

53:55.550 --> 53:57.870
And I'm just saying,
worry no more.

53:57.910 --> 54:01.750
Well, I should get going.
she's probably looking for me.

54:01.790 --> 54:05.590
Okay, I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

54:07.510 --> 54:09.870
This feels so good.

54:09.910 --> 54:12.790
Maybe you shouldn't jump
the gun just yet, Coop.

54:13.150 --> 54:16.030
Very good, very good.

54:16.070 --> 54:18.430
A-plus for comedy, Beth.

54:18.910 --> 54:21.310
Ruth Buzzi better watch
her back.

54:21.350 --> 54:24.190
Beth!
"Jump the gun."

54:28.870 --> 54:31.630
♪ Day by day ♪

54:31.670 --> 54:34.350
♪ Day by day ♪

54:34.390 --> 54:39.550
Okay, stop! I feel like I'm watching
regional theater, you guys.

54:39.590 --> 54:42.950
God, am I at the Cleveland
playhouse or something?

54:42.950 --> 54:46.230
Your craft is a muscle!
You need to exercise it!

54:46.270 --> 54:49.510
Take a break! Think about
what you've done.

54:49.990 --> 54:52.630
Gee, Susie, have you
seen Katie anywhere?

54:52.670 --> 54:54.990
No. why?

54:55.030 --> 54:57.190
No particular reason. But if you see her,
will you tell her I'm looking for her?

54:57.670 --> 55:00.310
- Sure.
- Okay.

55:02.230 --> 55:04.630
All right, with passion!

55:07.150 --> 55:09.550
Katie! Are you in here?

55:09.670 --> 55:11.110
Oh, hi.

55:11.590 --> 55:14.470
Um, I want to talk
to you later, okay?

55:14.830 --> 55:17.710
Oh, yeah. Sure.

55:27.550 --> 55:31.870
Dinner!

55:32.110 --> 55:34.990
- Have you seen J.J. and Gary? Do you
know where they are? - Don't know.

55:35.030 --> 55:37.870
I'm a little worried they might have
found out about us. - Hey!

55:38.110 --> 55:39.550
McKinley and Ben!

55:41.350 --> 55:44.110
This is for you.

55:47.470 --> 55:49.870
It's a chaise lounge.

55:50.110 --> 55:53.470
We didn't know if maybe you
guys already had one. We
have the receipt if you do.

55:53.510 --> 55:55.830
No, we don't have one. Thank you!

55:55.870 --> 55:58.270
It goes with the chenille throw
cloth Beth's sister gave us.

55:58.310 --> 56:01.830
Okay, everybody, attention.
I've got an announcement.

56:01.870 --> 56:04.270
I know you're all getting ready
for the big talent show tonight,

56:04.310 --> 56:07.670
but the following campers
need to put their trunks out...

56:07.670 --> 56:10.990
so the early bus to Boston
can pick them up at 7:30 a.m.

56:11.030 --> 56:15.830
Amanda Klein, Jessica Azaria,

56:15.830 --> 56:20.590
Ira Stevenberg, Sol Zimmerstein,

56:22.030 --> 56:26.230
uh, David... Ben Gurion.

56:28.150 --> 56:31.510
Cookin' slop for the grunts
in 'Nam was easier than this.

56:31.550 --> 56:34.870
We had no place being over there.

56:34.910 --> 56:36.750
It was a war we couldn't win, Gene.

56:36.790 --> 56:41.590
Yeah, well I'm gonna go
smear some mud on my ass.

56:41.630 --> 56:43.870
What?

56:44.350 --> 56:49.590
I said, "I hear
my bud's in class."

56:49.630 --> 56:52.750
I gotta go and call my bud
and see how his grades are.

56:52.790 --> 56:55.870
- I, I gotta go. go away, leave
me alone. - Gene, hold on.

56:56.350 --> 57:00.670
Look, I don't care what you do in your
private time, but don't lie about it.

57:00.710 --> 57:04.830
I mean, you clearly said,
"smear mud on my ass."

57:04.870 --> 57:10.630
And I'll tell you something.
If you wanna smear mud on your ass,
smear mud on your ass.

57:10.670 --> 57:12.910
Just be honest about it.

57:13.030 --> 57:16.390
Look, Gene, I've never
told anyone this before.

57:16.430 --> 57:20.230
But I can suck my own dick.
And I do it.

57:20.590 --> 57:22.990
A lot.

57:23.350 --> 57:25.270
There, I said it.
I was honest.

57:25.310 --> 57:27.510
And you know what, Gene?

57:27.550 --> 57:30.430
Being honest
makes you feel better.

57:31.630 --> 57:35.950
Hey, Katie, wait.
I'm sorry about before.

57:35.990 --> 57:38.350
- I hope that wasn't bad timing.
- No.

57:38.470 --> 57:40.350
- Coop, we have to talk.
- Sure.

57:40.390 --> 57:44.230
I was thinking that what happened
between us before was a mistake.

57:44.270 --> 57:46.590
- And, uh...
- What?

57:46.630 --> 57:48.550
I wasn't thinking straight.
It was wrong.

57:49.030 --> 57:53.830
No, it wasn't wrong.
Katie, why are you doing this?

57:54.310 --> 57:56.190
I'm really sorry.

57:56.230 --> 57:59.110
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

57:59.150 --> 58:01.470
I have a boyfriend, Coop.

58:01.510 --> 58:05.830
And I can't... I can't do
this. I'm sorry.

58:10.630 --> 58:12.630
Wait, Katie!

58:12.670 --> 58:16.270
When we first started hanging
out together this morning...

58:16.310 --> 58:18.150
we were just friends.

58:18.190 --> 58:21.550
But things change, and I've
fallen in love with you.

58:22.030 --> 58:25.030
And I just, I just know
that if you gave me a chance,

58:25.510 --> 58:27.870
I could make you feel so good.

58:27.910 --> 58:31.110
So I'm coming to you,
not as your buddy,

58:31.150 --> 58:33.670
and not as a co-counselor,
but for the first time as a man.

58:34.150 --> 58:36.510
A man who loves a woman,

58:36.550 --> 58:39.430
and who wants to hold her,
and provide for her,

58:39.470 --> 58:41.350
and, yes, have sex with her.

58:41.590 --> 58:44.470
But, seriously, Katie,
I love the way you laugh.

58:44.510 --> 58:46.470
And I love the way
your hair smells.

58:46.510 --> 58:50.350
And I love it that sometimes for
no reason, you're late for shul.

58:50.590 --> 58:53.790
And I don't care that
you're bowlegged and bilingual.

58:53.830 --> 58:56.710
All I know is I would have said "no"
to every person on your list...

58:56.750 --> 58:59.590
because I've always
wanted you.

59:01.870 --> 59:04.750
Coop, I don't know
what to say.

59:07.630 --> 59:09.790
Coop, wait!

59:11.230 --> 59:14.590
Rachael Clipperhofferman,

59:16.030 --> 59:17.950
- Steven Schenk...
- Beth!

59:18.190 --> 59:21.550
- Can I make a quick announcement
before we finish up? - Sure thing.

59:25.750 --> 59:29.590
I want to thank all of you
for a terrific summer.

59:29.630 --> 59:31.990
Cooking for all you
nice people...

59:32.350 --> 59:36.430
has really helped me get over the
fact that I fought in the Vietnam war.

59:36.470 --> 59:38.830
Have a great winter!
I'm gonna go hump the fridge!

59:39.190 --> 59:41.350
What?

59:45.190 --> 59:49.990
Yes, folks, it's true. I said,
"I'm gonna go hump the fridge."

59:51.790 --> 59:56.670
What you may not know is that
I also own a bottle of dick cream.

59:56.710 --> 01:00:01.510
I fondle my sweaters, and I often
like to smear mud on my ass.

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:05.110
You're probably asking yourselves,
"isn't he a weirdo,

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.030
outcast, loose cannon?"

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:12.150
Maybe. I don't think so.

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:16.030
I want to introduce you guys
to someone. This is my friend.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:20.830
I don't know who he is,
but I do know this.

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:26.110
At a time when I was trying
to hide myself from myself,

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.950
He was there to show me a new way.

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:34.270
Because I couldn't hide from him.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:38.110
And I can be proud of who I am.

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.390
I put it to you, Camp Firewood,

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:48.190
As we spend our last dinner together:
Be proud of who you are!

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.350
Look at me, ma!

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:57.030
I made it! I'm okay!

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:08.470
Now, if you don't mind,

01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:13.750
I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:32.950
Great!

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.150
Hey! Hey!

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:56.110
You fuckin' assholes!
Let me go!

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.870
No! No! No!

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:03.310
Please, stop!
No, no, no!

01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:06.670
No! No!

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:20.070
Oh, Henry,
I'm so happy.

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.990
But what will become
of us tomorrow?

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.830
Hey, you. Penny for your thoughts.

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:28.750
Beth, tomorrow's
the least of our problems.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.590
Don't tell me. Don't even
tell me you have crabs.

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.430
No. Well, yes,
but that's not the point.

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:38.310
- What is the point? - This isn't the
time or the place to discuss it.

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:42.190
Beth, meet me at the picnic table in
ten seconds. I'll tell you all about it.

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:44.550
Okay.

01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:57.510
Beth, hello. Thanks for coming.
Let's get right to it.

01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:59.950
You may recall ten seconds ago, I asked
you to join me here by the picnic table...

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:01.870
so I could tell you what's going on.

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:06.670
Well, earlier today, I saw what I
thought was possibly a planet,

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:09.870
also possibly a meteor
in the evening sky.

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:12.990
I now believe that object
was none other...

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:16.870
than a renegade piece of Skylab,
the NASA space station.

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:20.230
- And it's heading right for the camp.
- Oh, my God!

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.550
And there's more. We have
no way of pinpointing exactly
where it's going to land.

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:26.910
- It could kill us all!
- Jesus!

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.790
Wait a minute! There
might be a way...

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:32.670
to build a homemade
Skylab tracking device!

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:36.190
- Which accomplishes? - We could
surmise the location of impact.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:39.070
We could avert a tragedy on
the scale of the Hindenburg.

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:42.310
- Beth, will you help us?
- Anything you need.

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:44.950
Let's do it!

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.510
Hey, Andy?

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.630
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:51.310
- Okay, well...
- Time's up.

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:53.710
You said a second.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:57.190
- I want to ask you something. - So you
want to talk for more than a second?

01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:00.150
- Yeah.
- What is it then? like a couple minutes?

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.830
- No. yeah, at most, say, like
three minutes. - Fine.

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:06.070
- Do you really love Katie?
- Not really.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:08.070
Because I really
love her, man.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:11.950
And if you have one ounce of decency,
you will do the right thing and let her go.

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:13.630
- No way!
- No way?

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:16.990
Fuck no, dude. She's hot!
In fact, fuck off.

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.470
I will not fuck off.

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:22.150
You're making a really
big mistake, buddy,

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:24.790
because that woman
is not your plaything.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:29.350
Coop, seriously...
Fuck off.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:33.310
- I'm sick of talking about this with you.
- God!

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.790
Whoa!

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.390
So this is the Skylab
tracking device?

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.270
Is this gonna save
my camp?

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:56.950
I don't know. But if it does,
we'll all be heroes.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.750
In fact, I just got word
that if we pull this off,

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.430
I could be up for the Hopkins
prize for physics.

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:06.790
The Hopkins! Baby, what a dream.
You'll finally get your tenure.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.870
Be proud of who you are.

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:25.230
Huh?

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.590
- Gene?
- Shh.

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:32.470
- It isn't about the girl.
- It isn't?

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:34.870
Well, it is,

01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:40.150
but see if you
can follow me here.

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:43.030
It...

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:45.430
isn't.

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.750
Oh.

01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:52.630
So it is and it isn't.

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:02.710
You are ready to be taught
the new way.

01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:09.910
Will you help teach me
about this...

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:13.750
What is it?
a "new way"?

Abby. Abby, my lover,
my friend. Abby!

01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:54.790
- Hey, Neil, what's up?
- Victor abandoned the raft trip,

01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:57.230
and now the kids are about to
go over devil's canyon rapids!

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.950
- Where did he go?
- He wanted to get back to camp.

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:06.030
So you left the campers
alone on the river?

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:07.990
Only Victor knows how
to navigate those rapids.

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:10.430
We've got to find him and get him
back to that river.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:13.190
It's him!
Victor! Victor!

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:15.590
- We lost him, goddamn it!
- I've got him!

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:17.830
- Where is he?
- He's calling from inside the camp.

01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:21.229
The only other phone is in
the infirmary! We gotta go!

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.790
Ahhh.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:30.950
Beth, what's the matter?

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:34.310
The phone! Where's
the fucking phone?

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:37.670
In the back room.

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.390
We're losing time!

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:04.310
My baby!

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:07.310
I want to make love to you!

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.710
Abby!

01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:12.590
Abby?

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:15.910
Moose?

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:18.590
Um, you're gonna think
this is so shallow,

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:21.229
- but what was your name again?
- Oh, my God.

01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:25.069
Do you have any idea...

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:28.430
what I had to go through
to see you?

01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:31.790
You snooze, you lose, dude.

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:38.029
Victor Pulak, there's a raft of campers
about to go over devil's canyon rapids!

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:42.950
Are you gonna be part of the
problem, or are you the solution?

01:09:49.069 --> 01:09:51.430
Let's go.

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:54.350
Let's go!

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:00.470
Here we go.

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:08.110
- Oh, fuck my cock!
- What does it say?

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:11.510
According to this readout, Skylab is
going to land directly on the rec hall.

01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:13.390
Oh, no. When?

01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:15.790
- Sometime in the next 90 minutes.
- Oh, my God!

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:19.190
- That's only one mix tape.
- The talent show's starting right now!

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:22.670
- Good evening, Firewood!
- Are you ready for some talent?

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.190
- Beth, we have to evacuate the
rec hall immediately! - Yeah.

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:30.070
Victor!

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:31.790
Come on!

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:37.190
Stand back.

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.510
Whoa! Whoa!

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:46.790
You're a master, Vic.
What the... what the fu... what?

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:49.190
You're doing it.
You're actually doing it.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:53.030
Oh! You saved them!
You saved them!

01:10:56.270 --> 01:11:00.110
Victor Pulak,
You're okay by me.

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:02.030
I'm okay, you're okay.

01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:06.830
And Neil, next time we go
camping, you drive the Van.

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:25.790
I wish there was another way.
Maybe we should just let them die.

01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:27.710
No! My friend,
Jimmy's, in there.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.110
- You have a friend?
- I'm kidding.

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:32.270
Wait a minute.

01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:37.030
- No.
- What?

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:40.430
Well, there might be a way that
we could use our device...

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:44.270
to slightly change
its direction, but...

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:46.150
no, it's impossible.

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:48.070
Why? What's the problem?

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:50.470
In order to do it, we would
somehow have to be able...

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:53.390
to repeatedly generate random
numbers between one and twenty...

01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:55.310
in order to calibrate
the deferential.

01:11:55.790 --> 01:12:00.110
That would take some sort of
super mainframe computer
and we don't have one.

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.750
So all is lost.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:05.350
No, it's not.

01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:08.750
Any dungeon master
worth his weight in geldings...

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:12.110
goes nowhere without his...

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:15.910
20-sided die.

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:19.670
I'd like to introduce us
to the emcee for the evening.

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:24.950
We brought him all the way
from Kutscher's Country Club
in the Catskill mountains.

01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:28.310
Wait!
I have some bad news!

01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:32.270
And my bad news is...

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:41.510
and my bad news is... there is
no bad news. I was just joking.

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:43.750
Good one, Beth.

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:47.630
Let's give a Firewood welcome
to Mr. Alan Shemper!

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.630
Thank you very much.

01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:56.990
Hello, Camp Firewood.
Thank you for having me.

01:12:57.350 --> 01:13:02.150
I went to sleep-away camp so
long ago that it was the stone age.

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.030
Seriously, it wasn't
the stone age.

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:07.390
It was the ice age!

01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:10.910
No, really, it was the stone age.
But, folks,

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:14.950
actually I went
to camp Machnudin...

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.910
in the pine hills
of Westchester, New York.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:18.790
And that was so long ago...

01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:22.670
for breakfast we had to eat
scrambled pterodactyl eggs...

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.550
and Raptor bacon!

01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:28.790
Back then we didn't
have cots, we had slabs.

01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:33.350
Instead of sleeping bags,
we had sleeping pelts.

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:45.950
Our first act hails
all the way from over in bunk 2.

01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:51.230
And his name is Roger,
The Master Broom Balancer.

01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:05.030
Holy cow!

01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:09.470
Right here, right here.

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:11.870
Let's pray to God
this works.

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:16.070
♪ Love will pervade us
till death separates us ♪

01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:19.430
♪ We're friends
friends, friends ♪

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:22.750
That's from us
to bunk 7!

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.910
- Nine or six, what was it?
- Nine!

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:29.270
Okay. We're getting closer.
Give me another. Seven.

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:31.990
White folks are so stupid
when they get mad.

01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:35.390
They be like, "hey, asshole,
I'm going to kick your behind."

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:38.270
But the brothers don't even need
to raise their voice.

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:41.150
These motherfuckers be like,
"don't make me say it twice."

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:43.070
That's true,
that's true.

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.990
I hate white people!

01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:49.790
Be that as it may, this next act
is a guy named Bert Flugalman.

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:52.190
But it says here
that you all know him as...

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:55.310
Mooooose!

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:13.390
Gail.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.790
- Gail.
- Ron.

01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:20.990
What are you doing here?

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:23.630
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:26.510
And I want you back.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:33.070
Ron... I love you,

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:36.470
and I want to be with you,
but...

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:40.790
I've just had too many
woulda-coulda-shouldas in my life.

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.150
Well, I'm just...

01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:47.030
I'm just sick and tired of being
sick and tired, you know?

01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:50.390
And if you can't handle that,
then to hell with you!

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.390
You'll come back to me, Gail.
I know you will.

01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:01.910
I don't think so,
Ronald von Kleinenshtein.

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:04.310
I really don't think so.

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:14.150
And now, Camp Fizzie-poo,
performing the song...

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:17.510
"Day by day" from
the musical godspell,

01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:19.430
is Susie's drama group.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:22.310
Before we start,
I'd just like to say...

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:24.710
that the campers you're
about to see suck dick.

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:26.630

I can honestly say...

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:52.510
that there is
no Broadway ditty...

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:56.870
closer to my heart than the one
you just heard, "day bidet."

01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:58.630
Give me another.

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:00.590
- Twenty.
- There's not much time left.

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:05.270
When I was at camp, my favorite
activity was always arts and crafts.

01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:09.110
Or as we used to call it,
arts and "farts" and crafts.

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:11.630
We used to make drawings.

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.670
Cave drawings!

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:17.230
Which is my way of saying
we were cavemen.

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:20.630
I went to camp so long ago
that I can remember saying...

01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:23.950
"Sticks and stones may break
my bones," and meaning it!

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:28.790
I went to camp so long ago that
fucking Jesus Christ was my counselor!

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:32.630
And my best friend
hadn't fully evolved yet.

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:35.630
His name was Ugh,
and he walked on all fours!

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:38.870
There were two epidemics
when I went to camp.

01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:42.110
Head lice and the plague...
the bubonic plague.

- Uh, what?
- Yeah.

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:25.670
I've grown up a lot since before
dinner when we last talked.

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:29.470
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:33.830
Maybe see the world. I got a couple
more weeks before school starts.

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:38.030
- But...
- Hey.

01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:41.870
I want you to have this.

01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:50.150
Hurry up! I think I can see it
coming towards us!

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:56.870
And finally, ladies and germs,
is a dude...

01:19:56.910 --> 01:20:01.190
who goes by the name
of... "Steve."

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:04.430
Let's give him a hand.

01:20:14.150 --> 01:20:17.030
Come on, do something.
Or get the fuck off the stage!

01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:43.790
Is that wind?

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:02.750
Oh, my God.

01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:09.070
Coop?

01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:12.230
Coop, Coop, don't leave.

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:15.350
Coop!
Coop, I love you!

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:20.590
Yeah, I didn't know it until
this very moment for sure,

01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:24.950
but now I know, and it feels like
nothing I've ever known before.

01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:26.830
It feels so good.

Way to go, guys!

01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:52.070
Beth, we did it.

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:06.470
Whoo!

01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:28.670
Baby, that was beautiful!

01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:04.230
You better write to me.
I'm gonna miss you so much!

01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:11.790
Beth! Beth!
I got it!

01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:14.150
The Hopkins award!

01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:18.990
And, NASA's hiring me to go to work
for them at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:21.390
I'll have
a whole new life!

01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:23.750
That's wonderful.

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:27.630
I knew this would happen. I would meet
you, fall in love and you would leave me.

01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:30.510
Wait, hold on, Beth.
I've already told them,

01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:32.870
I need an apartment
for two people.

01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:36.230
- And they'll fly you back here
every summer. - Fuck you!

01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:41.070
And, Beth, I know we've been
having trouble with, you know...

01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:43.950
but I was thinking when the
time comes, we can adopt.

01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:46.790
Shh. It's happened.

01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:48.750
I'm pregnant.
We're gonna have a baby.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:52.590
Oh. Oh, baby!

01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:55.110
- Good-bye, Beth.
- Oh, hey!

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.510
Looks like everything
worked out for you two.

01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:59.910
Yeah, it's the best thing that's
ever happened in my life.

01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:01.830
I hope you like shrimp cocktail,
because we want you...

01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:04.710
to be the guest of honor
at our wedding next week.

01:25:05.190 --> 01:25:07.110
We would be delighted.
But I hope it's not Jumbo shrimp...

01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:10.470
because I'm allergic to oxymorons.

01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:15.750
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:34.710
We saved everyone's life
and they'll never know it.

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:36.630
I almost like it better
that way.

01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:39.030
It was us rolling the dice
that diverted it, right?

01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:42.830
- Not the enormous gust of wind, right?
- Right.

01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:46.230
I feel like this entire summer,
which kind of sucked,

01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:49.590
has been rejuvenated by the
events of the past 24 hours.

01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:54.390
Yeah, it's like...
well, forget it.

01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:56.310
- You know what?
- What?

01:25:56.790 --> 01:26:00.630
You guys are my best friends.
Well, my only friends.

01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.510
- Yeah.
- Nanoo-nanoo.

01:26:10.230 --> 01:26:12.590
- So, this is it, babe.
- Yep.

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:16.230
So, obviously I think we should get
together in the city next weekend.

01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:20.710
- I'll call my parents, and you can
talk to your dad and Kim. - Listen.

01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:25.110
Last night was really great. You were
incredibly romantic and heroic.

01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:27.950
No doubt about it.
And that's great.

01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:31.310
But I've thought about it,
and my thing is this:

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:34.230
Andy's really hot. And don't
get me wrong, you're cute too.

01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:38.990
But Andy is like cut from
marble. He's gorgeous.

01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:42.870
He's like this beautiful face
and this incredible body,

01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:46.710
and I genuinely don't care
that he's kind of lame.

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:49.830
I don't even care
that he cheats on me.

01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:53.150
And I like you more than
I like Andy, Coop, but I'm 16.

01:26:53.190 --> 01:26:56.070
And maybe it will be a different story
like when I'm ready to get married.

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:59.910
But right now, I'm entirely
about sex. I just want Andy.

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:02.270
- Yeah.
- I wanna take him,

01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:06.150
And grab him and just fuck
his brains out, you know?

01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:08.590
So that's where my
priorities are right now.

01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:11.230
Sex. Specifically with Andy
and not with you.

01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:13.830
But you're really nice.
Everybody thinks so.

01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:18.150
And I'm sorry if this isn't the direction
you saw things going between us.

01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:21.070
I still totally want
to be friends.

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:23.910
You better write me
a letter, okay?

01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:26.270
Sure.

01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:28.590
Cool?

01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:34.350
