00:15.652 --> 00:16.521
[grunts]

00:18.173 --> 00:20.913
You can tell a lot about
a person by their car, Bixby.

00:20.956 --> 00:22.869
So you've said.
Many times.

00:22.913 --> 00:24.826
But owners all got one thing
in common.

00:24.869 --> 00:26.608
You've ruined their day?

00:26.652 --> 00:27.695
They've all got an excuse.

00:27.739 --> 00:29.869
Take this guy...

00:29.913 --> 00:31.043
Yeah. He probably
lives here.

00:31.086 --> 00:32.130
Forgot to move his car.

00:32.173 --> 00:33.739
Let's just knock on his door.

00:33.782 --> 00:36.695
And here I thought you had
what it takes to do this job.

00:36.739 --> 00:38.652
And here I thought you
had a soul.

00:38.695 --> 00:40.130
Lost it a long time ago.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.434
Hazard of the job.

00:42.478 --> 00:45.652
Otherwise, you start taking
the insults personally.

00:45.695 --> 00:46.956
"Meter Maid."

00:47.000 --> 00:48.521
"Rent-a-Cop."

00:48.565 --> 00:49.956
LEAD PARKING COP:
"Scooter Pig."

00:50.000 --> 00:52.478
You can't sympathize
with these people:

00:52.521 --> 00:54.043
they broke the law.

00:54.086 --> 00:57.391
And for that, they must pay.

00:58.521 --> 01:00.173
BIXBY:
Oh, my God.

01:00.217 --> 01:02.173
Call the police!

01:02.217 --> 01:03.826
I am the police.

01:03.869 --> 01:04.826
The real police!

01:43.217 --> 01:44.347
Can't remember
the last time

01:44.391 --> 01:45.608
we all arrived at work
at the same time.

01:45.652 --> 01:47.652
It was spring 2006.

01:47.695 --> 01:49.000
The cherry blossoms
were in bloom...

01:49.043 --> 01:50.956
Of course.
Now, I remember it well.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.434
McGee wore gray. You wore blue.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.217
I wore green.
I was
kidding.
I was not.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.826
McFraud,

01:55.869 --> 01:58.086
did your landlord's kid steal
your credit card again?

01:58.130 --> 02:00.130
These aren't mine.

02:00.173 --> 02:02.652
Must have something to do with
Agent Barrett and her team.

02:02.695 --> 02:04.652
Maybe someone else
has arrived.

02:04.695 --> 02:06.652
Has anyone else
talked to her lately?

02:06.695 --> 02:07.652
I mean,
you know,

02:07.695 --> 02:09.913
heard any...
details?

02:12.478 --> 02:13.695
Tony!
What?

02:15.086 --> 02:17.913
Barrett? No. Why should I?

02:17.956 --> 02:19.956
I-I was just, uh...

02:20.000 --> 02:21.913
wondering if you had, you know,

02:21.956 --> 02:23.478
spoken to her.

02:23.521 --> 02:26.000
I know she's spending
the next few days

02:26.043 --> 02:27.217
setting up temporary housing.

02:27.260 --> 02:28.652
Her team is still abroad;

02:28.695 --> 02:29.826
won't be back
for a couple weeks.

02:31.173 --> 02:33.086
Or so I've heard.

02:33.130 --> 02:34.695
McGEE:
Hey, these aren't NCIS boxes;

02:34.739 --> 02:37.521
they're case files from
Metro Police.

02:39.739 --> 02:42.217
Well, help yourself, Snoopy.

02:42.260 --> 02:46.086
It was on my desk.

02:46.130 --> 02:47.695
This is a Metro investigation
from two weeks ago.

02:47.739 --> 02:49.608
Does anyone else find that odd?

02:49.652 --> 02:51.739
Yeah. Me.

02:51.782 --> 02:53.260
"Gear up," boss?

02:53.304 --> 02:55.130
Nope.

02:55.173 --> 02:57.478
"Let's go"? "Dead Marine"?

02:57.521 --> 02:58.913
"Grab your gear"?Nope.

02:58.956 --> 02:59.869
VANCE:
Grab your gear.

03:01.434 --> 03:03.173
What?
Got a body.

03:05.173 --> 03:06.347
Where?

03:06.391 --> 03:07.782
The morgue.

03:07.826 --> 03:08.913
Been there for two weeks.

03:12.130 --> 03:13.739
Mysterious.

03:16.608 --> 03:18.217
Stand down, Skippy.

03:32.391 --> 03:35.739
Victim is retired
Marine colonel Yale Peyton.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.086
25-year vet.

03:37.130 --> 03:40.565
Panama, Iraq, Afghanistan.

03:40.608 --> 03:42.043
Distinguished Service Medal.
Silver Star.

03:43.782 --> 03:46.652
He was struck seven times
with an axe.

03:46.695 --> 03:49.304
Why are we talking about
a two-week-old Metro case?

03:49.347 --> 03:50.956
Metro turned the case over
to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.304
They kicked it back.

03:52.347 --> 03:54.608
They didn't think they had
enough for a conviction.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.043
Yeah, and...

03:56.086 --> 03:58.347
U.S. Attorney's an old friend.

03:58.391 --> 04:00.347
We worked together
when he was a JAG officer;

04:00.391 --> 04:03.043
he called in a favor.
A favor?

04:03.086 --> 04:07.304
He knows NCIS has a couple
of the best interrogators

04:07.347 --> 04:09.347
in law enforcement.
You happen to be one of them.

04:09.391 --> 04:10.869
Who's the other one?

04:12.043 --> 04:14.695
Metro's convinced
they got the killer.

04:14.739 --> 04:16.565
The evidence was mostly
circumstantial.

04:16.608 --> 04:18.347
They had to release him.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.478
U.S. Attorney won't indict
without a confession.

04:21.956 --> 04:24.478
Leon, the victim here's
a retired Marine.

04:24.521 --> 04:27.173
And NCIS doesn't usually handle
retired personnel.

04:27.217 --> 04:30.173
But this wouldn't be the first
time that we made an exception.

04:30.217 --> 04:32.304
Military has
a vested interest

04:32.347 --> 04:33.695
in who gets
the survivor's benefits.

04:33.739 --> 04:35.739
So what makes this one a favor?

04:38.782 --> 04:40.304
My friend's up for
an appointment

04:40.347 --> 04:42.434
as a federal judge.

04:42.478 --> 04:43.956
So we're taking this case

04:44.000 --> 04:46.260
so your friend gets
a better tee time?

04:46.304 --> 04:48.000
No. We're taking on this case

04:48.043 --> 04:49.565
to put away a guy
that killed a Marine.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.086
We need to get a monster to
admit that he's a monster.

04:56.956 --> 04:58.739
Do you think you can do it?

05:00.565 --> 05:02.478
TONY:
Metro was right.

05:02.521 --> 05:04.173
According to their files,

05:04.217 --> 05:06.304
it would appear
their suspect did it.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.521
McGEE:
Well, they built a strong case.

05:07.565 --> 05:08.782
Got a reliable witness

05:08.826 --> 05:11.130
who puts him
at the scene of the crime.

05:11.173 --> 05:13.217
Items missing from the crime
scene were found in his car.

05:13.260 --> 05:15.130
A history of
violence, drug use...

05:15.173 --> 05:17.521
Okay, so why did
the U.S. Attorney not prosecute?

05:17.565 --> 05:19.086
No smoking gun.

05:19.130 --> 05:21.043
If they try this case
and lose...

05:21.086 --> 05:23.521
It doesn't look good.
But if we get a confession...

05:23.565 --> 05:24.652
Do you have a plan, Tony?

05:24.695 --> 05:26.652
Yes.

05:26.695 --> 05:28.086
We get into the
killer's head.

05:28.130 --> 05:30.695
Back him into a corner.
Catch him in a lie.

05:30.739 --> 05:32.652
Press the right button,
and... [pops lips]

05:32.695 --> 05:35.521
Metro questioned this guy
for 27 hours

05:35.565 --> 05:36.260
and never got a confession.[cell phone rings]

05:36.304 --> 05:37.565
DiNozzo.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.130
Lover boy.
Interrogation. Now.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.217
Yeah, boss. On my way.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.478
Now it's our turn.

05:44.739 --> 05:46.000
TONY:
Few folks find the fine flavor.

05:46.043 --> 05:47.347
Jim, Jill, Jane, Johnny jammed.

05:47.391 --> 05:48.956
[faster]:
Jim, Jill, Jane,
Johnny jammed.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.956
Geez, DiNozzo.Sorry, boss.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.695
Just loosening up
the tongue-- I'm good.

05:54.043 --> 05:55.913
We'll see.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.217
Hey, Nick.

05:58.260 --> 05:59.565
Thanks for coming in.

05:59.608 --> 06:01.086
Like to ask you a few questions.

06:01.130 --> 06:03.130
Sure.

06:03.173 --> 06:04.913
Could I have a glass
of water, uh,

06:04.956 --> 06:06.782
if it's okay
to drink in here?

06:18.086 --> 06:20.565
GIBBS:
You okay, Nick?

06:20.608 --> 06:22.000
I haven't
slept much.

06:22.043 --> 06:23.695
Been staying
at a friend's house.

06:23.739 --> 06:25.565
Mm.

06:25.608 --> 06:28.608
I'm Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

06:28.652 --> 06:30.652
This is Special Agent--You know why
you're here, Nick?

06:30.695 --> 06:32.304
Yes.

06:32.347 --> 06:34.434
You think
I killed my father.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.000
Yes...

06:36.043 --> 06:38.521
we do.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.826
Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?

06:40.869 --> 06:42.608
You want a snack
or something?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.695
You know why we think
you killed your father?

06:44.739 --> 06:47.565
Same reason the police did?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.608
That's right.

06:49.652 --> 06:52.565
[chair bangs]Because you had means,

06:52.608 --> 06:55.434
opportunity and motive.

06:55.478 --> 06:58.652
And those are
good reasons, Nick.

06:58.695 --> 07:01.304
Well, I'm sure you'll get
just as far as the police did.

07:01.347 --> 07:04.956
Which is not very.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.043
TONY: So, which of these
reasons do you think we're...

07:07.086 --> 07:10.173
thin on, Nick?

07:12.260 --> 07:13.217
Are you a skater?

07:13.260 --> 07:16.608
Uh... yeah.

07:16.652 --> 07:20.826
TONY: Means...
we know that, uh...

07:20.869 --> 07:24.217
you could just go into the
garage and grab the axe.

07:24.260 --> 07:27.043
We know you got a key
to the house.

07:30.521 --> 07:31.739
You know you're not supposed

07:31.782 --> 07:33.391
to use your hands
to break your fall.

07:33.434 --> 07:36.391
Oh... accident.

07:36.434 --> 07:38.739
TONY:
Opportunity.

07:38.782 --> 07:41.217
We've got a witness
that puts you at the
scene of the crime

07:41.260 --> 07:42.565
at the time
of the murder.

07:42.608 --> 07:44.130
And you still haven't given
anyone an explanation.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.391
Or an
alibi.
So?

07:48.434 --> 07:51.000
What, uh... What
happened right there?

07:51.043 --> 07:55.043
Oh, I was skating downtown
in this parking lot,

07:55.086 --> 07:57.434
and this car came out...
TONY:
Motive!

07:57.478 --> 07:59.739
You must think
we don't have motive, Nick.

08:00.956 --> 08:02.347
[Tony snickers]

08:02.391 --> 08:03.956
Is that why you shouldn't
go to prison?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.826
No.

08:05.869 --> 08:09.000
I mean... yes...
I shouldn't.

08:09.043 --> 08:10.565
TONY:
You're right.

08:10.608 --> 08:13.304
A Marine pension--
it's not exactly

08:13.347 --> 08:14.695
worth killing for.

08:14.739 --> 08:15.782
And Metro never did
prove motive, so...

08:19.304 --> 08:21.304
I guess it's
up to us now.

08:21.347 --> 08:24.304
H-How long am
I gonna be here?

08:24.347 --> 08:25.652
A while.

08:27.739 --> 08:28.652
Did you cry when
your daddy died, Nick?

08:30.304 --> 08:32.826
Yes, I-I did.

08:32.869 --> 08:34.000
So you were there?

08:34.043 --> 08:35.000
When he died?

08:36.652 --> 08:37.956
I don't follow.

08:39.826 --> 08:43.695
TONY: Where were you
when your daddy died?

08:43.739 --> 08:45.000
It's a simple question.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.521
Think my watch stopped.

08:48.565 --> 08:51.000
You know what time
it is, Nick?

08:51.043 --> 08:55.521
Um, I... think
around 2:00.

08:57.565 --> 09:00.695
Yeah, it's pretty close: 2:10.

09:00.739 --> 09:03.347
So, did you kill
your father, Nick?

09:03.391 --> 09:05.086
TONY:
Answer the question.

09:05.130 --> 09:06.391
Why'd you kill him?

09:10.608 --> 09:14.304
That's why I said
I didn't need a lawyer.

09:14.347 --> 09:15.695
Because I didn't do it.

09:15.739 --> 09:18.869
I loved him.
TONY:
Oh.

09:18.913 --> 09:20.043
You hear that?
He loved him.

09:20.086 --> 09:21.652
GIBBS:
Yeah, I heard.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.173
TONY: Well, here's
the deal, Nick.

09:23.217 --> 09:24.652
First, we're gonna prove
you're lying.

09:24.695 --> 09:26.739
Then we're gonna prove
you killed him.

09:26.782 --> 09:28.391
And then you're going to
go to prison.

09:28.434 --> 09:30.217
Did I miss anything?
No.

09:33.826 --> 09:36.391
"Here comes a candle
to light you to bed

09:36.434 --> 09:39.695
"Here comes a chopper
to chop off your head

09:39.739 --> 09:42.347
"Chop, chop, chop, chop--

09:42.391 --> 09:44.608
the last man's dead."

09:44.652 --> 09:47.260
Ah, Agent David.

09:47.304 --> 09:50.956
I take it that Jethro
is otherwise occupied?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.695
Will be
for quite some time.

09:53.739 --> 09:55.869
I've heard you
talk to the dead, Ducky,

09:55.913 --> 09:58.782
but I did not know
you read poetry
to them as well.

09:58.826 --> 10:01.652
They are playground rhymes.

10:01.695 --> 10:03.565
And they have something to do
with our victim?

10:03.608 --> 10:05.043
"Lizzy Borden took an axe

10:05.086 --> 10:07.000
"And gave her mother
40 whacks.

10:07.043 --> 10:10.086
When she saw what she had done,
She gave her father 41."

10:10.130 --> 10:14.913
Well, I only count
seven "whacks."
Ah, yes.

10:14.956 --> 10:17.260
And according to
the coroner's report,

10:17.304 --> 10:19.043
they were the cause of death.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.869
Crime of passion?

10:20.913 --> 10:22.608
Of rage.

10:22.652 --> 10:25.000
The multiple blows--
especially to the face--

10:25.043 --> 10:28.826
suggest that the killer was not
only familiar with his victim,

10:28.869 --> 10:32.478
but also furious
on an almost primal level.

10:32.521 --> 10:35.086
Like a son...
angry at his father?

10:35.130 --> 10:36.565
Ah, possibly.

10:36.608 --> 10:40.391
I had Agent McGee make me
copies of the transcripts

10:40.434 --> 10:42.565
of Metro's interrogation
of Nick Peyton.

10:42.608 --> 10:46.217
Perhaps they can give me some
insight into the young man.

10:46.260 --> 10:47.347
He's barely a man.

10:47.391 --> 10:49.956
He's 18 but he looks 12.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.347
Looks can be deceiving.

10:51.391 --> 10:52.695
Clearly.

10:52.739 --> 10:55.608
If you find anything,
call me, Ducky.

10:57.608 --> 11:00.826
"Ring-a-ring of roses,
A pocketful of posies

11:00.869 --> 11:03.347
[gasping]:
"Atishoo! Atishoo!

11:03.391 --> 11:06.173
All fall down."

11:22.000 --> 11:25.260
Hi, honey! Welcome home!

11:25.304 --> 11:28.608
To our humble, bloody abode.

11:28.652 --> 11:31.043
Cozy.
Yep.

11:31.086 --> 11:33.521
Since Metro removed
all the evidence,

11:33.565 --> 11:35.478
the actual crime scene was
released last week.

11:35.521 --> 11:36.956
So, this is
the next best thing.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.304
Everything is positioned

11:38.347 --> 11:39.869
exactly as it was
found by police,

11:39.913 --> 11:43.478
including our
body double Carl,

11:43.521 --> 11:47.260
who is laying in
for our deceased colonel.

11:47.304 --> 11:50.782
And there is... this.

11:50.826 --> 11:54.652
Ah, his tablet; the only
computer the colonel owned.

11:54.695 --> 11:56.956
Yep. It's been sitting
in so much blood;

11:57.000 --> 11:58.130
kind of drowned
the little guy.

11:58.173 --> 11:59.956
Metro give it CPR?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.347
They tried, but I think
it needs a "Timmy touch."

12:02.391 --> 12:04.739
Mm.
Do we have anything else?

12:04.782 --> 12:07.521
Metro's finding says all
the blood is from the victim.

12:07.565 --> 12:12.043
Nick's fingerprints and hair are
everywhere, but he lives here.

12:12.086 --> 12:13.956
How could a kid
murder his own father?

12:14.000 --> 12:18.652
Well, the tox panel that was
taken when Nick was arrested--

12:18.695 --> 12:20.347
it shows he had
a whole cocktail

12:20.391 --> 12:21.652
of prescription meds
in his system.

12:21.695 --> 12:24.130
I mean, our nice Nick
in interrogation--

12:24.173 --> 12:26.000
he could be a totally
different Nick

12:26.043 --> 12:28.130
when he's blitzed
out of his mind.
I don't
remember anything

12:28.173 --> 12:30.782
about prescriptions
in his medical files.

12:30.826 --> 12:33.086
Exactly. So there's no
telling what kind of rage

12:33.130 --> 12:35.739
this combo may have
sent him into.

12:35.782 --> 12:40.043
Well, there may be one person
who could help us.

12:40.086 --> 12:41.782
WOMAN:
Nick had a drug problem.

12:41.826 --> 12:44.434
And some violent outbursts
while intoxicated,

12:44.478 --> 12:46.956
but he's basically a good kid.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.521
He was in your rehab
facility how many
times, Dr. Gracey?

12:51.565 --> 12:54.782
Three.
ZIVA:
So he relapsed twice?

12:54.826 --> 12:56.782
Actually,
Nick never completed

12:56.826 --> 12:59.086
a full
rehabilitation cycle.

12:59.130 --> 13:02.782
He was...
a challenging case.

13:02.826 --> 13:04.695
What were his
primary addictions--

13:04.739 --> 13:05.782
Heroin? Cocaine?

13:05.826 --> 13:07.826
No. Pills.

13:07.869 --> 13:10.304
What was Nick's relationship
with his father?

13:10.347 --> 13:13.217
N-Nick and his dad had a...

13:13.260 --> 13:16.260
conflicted and complicated
relationship.

13:16.304 --> 13:19.043
Did they ever fight?Like I told the police,
I can't discuss anything

13:19.086 --> 13:21.043
that was told to me
in confidence, so...

13:21.086 --> 13:23.043
Is there anything
you can discuss?

13:23.086 --> 13:24.913
For instance,
do you think

13:24.956 --> 13:27.000
Nick is capable of
killing his father?

13:27.043 --> 13:31.347
You'll find that he's
strong-willed and independent.

13:31.391 --> 13:33.521
But I don't think
he's capable of murder.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.260
All set, boss.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.521
[grunts]

13:48.565 --> 13:50.652
What's going on?

13:53.347 --> 13:54.739
Movies.

14:04.086 --> 14:06.956
I thought he
threw these out.

14:23.913 --> 14:26.434
Any emotion for
"Daddy Dearest"?

14:26.478 --> 14:28.043
Not a single tear.

14:28.086 --> 14:30.652
TONY: Kid can't even look
at an image of his dad.

14:30.695 --> 14:34.391
Clearly Oedipus and Rex
didn't get along too well.

14:37.217 --> 14:38.521
Sealed juvie records.

14:38.565 --> 14:40.000
Not sealed anymore.

14:40.043 --> 14:42.782
I feel bad for any guy
who ever dates your daughter.

14:42.826 --> 14:45.347
Me too.

14:48.043 --> 14:50.782
TONY:
"Daddy-and-me"

14:50.826 --> 14:52.695
had three violent altercations
over the past two years.

14:52.739 --> 14:53.913
Cops had to break it up.

14:53.956 --> 14:56.478
Yelling, screaming.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.956
Sounds like
one of Ziva's family reunions.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.086
Colonel tried to put him
in military school

15:00.130 --> 15:02.347
before his last
deployment.

15:02.391 --> 15:04.956
He couldn't find one
that would take him.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.739
History of drug abuse,
fights at school.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.347
Rehab roulette.

15:10.391 --> 15:11.782
VANCE:
And not a shred of emotion.

15:11.826 --> 15:15.173
TONY: We've been talking
to him for four hours.

15:15.217 --> 15:16.347
For a kid who said he, uh,

15:16.391 --> 15:18.434
loved his father...

15:18.478 --> 15:20.347
he's never
called him Dad once.

15:20.391 --> 15:22.739
He hates him.

15:22.782 --> 15:25.347
VANCE: Which gives us
something Metro never had.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.347
Motive.

15:27.391 --> 15:28.826
A pressure point.

15:28.869 --> 15:32.521
It's time to
start pressing.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.608
Hard.

15:52.565 --> 15:54.869
[switch clicks]

16:02.869 --> 16:07.000
[chair bangs,
Nick grunts]

16:07.043 --> 16:09.608
Missed some good movies.

16:09.652 --> 16:11.043
I've seen them before.

16:11.086 --> 16:12.869
Your dad takes a good picture.

16:12.913 --> 16:15.130
Oo-rah.

16:17.217 --> 16:19.000
I particularly like those three
right behind you.

16:27.565 --> 16:29.695
Behind you.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.043
Nick...

16:38.086 --> 16:40.217
you hate him.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.217
Why?

16:43.260 --> 16:45.173
Military school?

16:45.217 --> 16:50.521
Rehab?

16:50.565 --> 16:52.217
Agent Gibbs...

16:52.260 --> 16:53.869
this isn't going to work.

16:55.043 --> 16:56.521
What?

16:56.565 --> 16:58.260
This.

16:58.304 --> 17:00.217
Why?

17:00.260 --> 17:03.652
Because... I didn't kill him.

17:06.304 --> 17:08.043
I said I didn't want a lawyer,

17:08.086 --> 17:11.130
but... I'd like
a diet cream soda now.

17:11.173 --> 17:13.347
If you have one.

17:43.217 --> 17:44.782
ZIVA:
What are you doing, McGee?

17:44.826 --> 17:46.434
Nothing.

17:46.478 --> 17:48.000
You were snoopying.
I saw you.

17:48.043 --> 17:50.043
Clearly Tony has been
a very bad influence on you.

17:50.086 --> 17:51.956
Look, I was just curious.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.391
Do you lock your desk?

17:53.434 --> 17:55.869
No.
Exactly.

17:55.913 --> 17:58.000
What is it about us
that Barrett doesn't trust?

17:58.043 --> 17:59.956
Ah, stay out of
her drawers, McGee.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.782
What do we got?

18:00.826 --> 18:01.956
We've been going over

18:02.000 --> 18:03.086
the last of the Metro files.

18:03.130 --> 18:04.695
What'd they miss?

18:04.739 --> 18:06.130
Uh, not a whole lot.

18:06.173 --> 18:07.608
The mother in the home movies.
Where is she?

18:07.652 --> 18:08.739
She walked out
two years ago.

18:08.782 --> 18:10.521
Metro's not been able
to track her down.

18:10.565 --> 18:12.086
McGee.

18:12.130 --> 18:13.521
Already been digging.

18:13.565 --> 18:16.086
Donna Peyton,
Formerly Donna Jenkins

18:16.130 --> 18:17.826
of Butte, Montana.

18:17.869 --> 18:20.260
She attended Monroe University.

18:20.304 --> 18:21.434
McGEE: Poli-sci and
communications.

18:21.478 --> 18:24.434
Graduated cum laude
in '89.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.130
She married
Colonel Peyton-- '91.

18:27.173 --> 18:30.173
And she gave birth
to Nick-- '93.

18:30.217 --> 18:32.043
What's the punch line?

18:32.086 --> 18:34.826
Stopped using her cell phone
and credit cards two years ago.

18:34.869 --> 18:36.695
ZIVA:
She's off the grid.
McGEE:
Disappeared.

18:36.739 --> 18:38.173
No missing
persons report.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.043
No divorce papers.

18:40.086 --> 18:43.173
Maybe the colonel is not the
first parent Nick has murdered.

18:43.217 --> 18:44.695
Find her. Or her body.

18:44.739 --> 18:46.521
McGEE: Last known address
is the Peyton residence.

18:46.565 --> 18:48.043
First thing in the morning,
talk to the neighbors.

18:50.521 --> 18:52.217
McGEE: Mr. Stafford,
how long have you lived
next to the Peytons?

18:52.260 --> 18:54.000
Almost 15 years.

18:54.043 --> 18:55.434
Mm.

18:55.478 --> 18:57.304
Now, in your statement
to Metro Police,

18:57.347 --> 18:59.391
you never mention
Mrs. Peyton.

18:59.434 --> 19:01.000
Is there anything you can
tell us about her?

19:01.043 --> 19:02.695
Donna? No. Seemed nice.

19:02.739 --> 19:03.826
So do you know
where she is now?

19:03.869 --> 19:06.043
No, no.
Not since she left years ago.

19:06.086 --> 19:08.347
And by "left"...?

19:08.391 --> 19:10.739
Well, she and Yale
were private people.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.478
But, uh, there were strains
in their marriage.

19:12.521 --> 19:14.043
He was always deploying.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.826
Their son, Nick, uh...

19:16.869 --> 19:18.478
Uh, kid's a little bit
of a nightmare.

19:18.521 --> 19:19.869
According to
your statement,

19:19.913 --> 19:22.043
you said you saw Nick here
the night of the murder.

19:22.086 --> 19:24.869
Yes-- I came out to go
to the store at 8:30,

19:24.913 --> 19:27.521
and, uh, Nick's car
had jumped the curb

19:27.565 --> 19:29.782
right here,
in front of my house.

19:29.826 --> 19:33.000
He was really buzzed.Buzzed?

19:33.043 --> 19:35.086
Drugs.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.086
Drugs.
Yeah.

19:37.130 --> 19:38.434
Yeah, he was always high.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.478
And he stumbles out of his car,
and he dumps a...

19:40.521 --> 19:43.608
BeltWay Burger bag
right on my lawn.

19:43.652 --> 19:45.521
And you remember
the fast-food brand because...?

19:45.565 --> 19:47.043
Because I had to clean it up.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.826
Every single fry.

19:48.869 --> 19:50.782
I left right after that.

19:50.826 --> 19:52.434
Got back around 10:00,
and Nick's car was gone.

19:54.086 --> 19:57.217
Did you see Nick
go into the house?
Oh, yeah.

19:57.260 --> 19:59.652
That's, uh,
when the arguing started.

19:59.695 --> 20:00.782
What were they arguing about?

20:02.173 --> 20:06.347
Money, drugs, rehab--
same as always.

20:08.782 --> 20:11.826
Drugs do bad things
to decent people.

20:11.869 --> 20:15.173
Seems like you've had, um,
personal experience.

20:17.173 --> 20:21.434
I lost my... teenage girl
to drugs last year.

20:21.478 --> 20:23.826
An overdose.

20:23.869 --> 20:26.217
You try to protect them, but...

20:26.260 --> 20:29.391
it's, uh... hard.

20:35.478 --> 20:36.565
Hey, Nick.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.304
Are you hungry?

20:44.347 --> 20:46.956
I don't eat meat. I'm vegan.Huh.

20:49.086 --> 20:50.869
Milk shake.

20:50.913 --> 20:53.173
Vegan.

20:53.217 --> 20:54.652
Really?

20:58.086 --> 20:59.608
I've heard otherwise.

20:59.652 --> 21:00.521
From who?

21:03.521 --> 21:04.869
GIBBS:
Some girl at the window.

21:04.913 --> 21:07.521
She said that she remembers

21:07.565 --> 21:09.260
that you like your burgers
whammy style.

21:10.826 --> 21:14.000
She says that she remembers
you that night...

21:14.043 --> 21:15.434
acting high.

21:15.478 --> 21:18.260
Couple hours
before your meaty meal,

21:18.304 --> 21:20.391
you, uh, used your credit card
to buy a movie ticket.

21:20.434 --> 21:23.913
Sunday Silver Screen Classics'
showing of Casablanca.

21:23.956 --> 21:25.826
Remember?

21:25.869 --> 21:27.086
Yeah.

21:27.130 --> 21:29.391
It's an odd choice
for an 18-year-old kid.

21:29.434 --> 21:30.652
Did you enjoy it?
The movie?

21:32.043 --> 21:34.304
Yes.
Well,
I'll tell you, it has

21:34.347 --> 21:36.521
one of my favorite
all-time movie moments.

21:36.565 --> 21:37.869
You know the scene
I'm talking about?

21:37.913 --> 21:40.043
Oh, come on.
You know,

21:40.086 --> 21:41.173
when Rick's jumping
up and down on that bed

21:41.217 --> 21:43.565
filled with all the money,

21:43.608 --> 21:46.217
and he's singing
"God Bless America."

21:46.260 --> 21:48.086
Yeah.
That's pretty good.

21:48.130 --> 21:49.391
And then the lamp tips over?

21:49.434 --> 21:50.434
[laughs]

21:50.478 --> 21:52.391
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

21:52.434 --> 21:53.391
GIBBS:
Hey, Nick,

21:53.434 --> 21:54.608
I haven't seen
a lot of movies,

21:54.652 --> 21:56.608
but I've seen that
one, and that scene

21:56.652 --> 21:59.347
you're talking about--
it's not in the movie.

22:00.521 --> 22:02.478
What?

22:02.521 --> 22:04.434
TONY:
I just made it up.

22:04.478 --> 22:05.869
You're not the only liar
in the room.

22:05.913 --> 22:07.913
Sounds to me
like you lead

22:07.956 --> 22:11.391
a double life-- one sober, the
other in a drug-induced stupor.

22:11.434 --> 22:13.130
Or is it a full-on
blackout, Nick?

22:13.173 --> 22:14.434
What are you
talking about?

22:14.478 --> 22:15.913
What else don't
you remember--

22:15.956 --> 22:18.217
the ax, the blood,
killing your father?

22:18.260 --> 22:19.304
Do you remember
anything

22:19.347 --> 22:20.826
you did that night?No.

22:20.869 --> 22:22.347
Really?

22:22.391 --> 22:25.565
I-I-I mean...

22:25.608 --> 22:26.652
GIBBS:
Nick...

22:28.086 --> 22:31.260
Can you honestly tell me...

22:31.304 --> 22:33.695
for certain...

22:33.739 --> 22:35.478
that you didn't kill
your father?

22:40.695 --> 22:42.565
[voice breaking]:
No.

23:04.695 --> 23:05.826
This kid's
on the ropes.

23:05.869 --> 23:06.913
Let's knock him out.

23:06.956 --> 23:08.086
It's not a
prizefight, Leon.

23:08.130 --> 23:09.391
That's exactly
what it is.

23:09.434 --> 23:10.608
We keep pushing
him now,

23:10.652 --> 23:12.217
he'll shut down
instead of opening up.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.695
He's BS-ing us.

23:13.739 --> 23:15.304
Well, we need more
to prove that.

23:15.347 --> 23:16.304
Then find it.
The kid did it.

23:16.347 --> 23:17.391
You really want

23:17.434 --> 23:18.826
that buddy of yours
to be a judge,

23:18.869 --> 23:20.478
don't you?

23:20.521 --> 23:22.695
Or is there something else
you want to tell me, Leon?

23:22.739 --> 23:24.434
You got three hours.

23:24.478 --> 23:27.739
Then I'm going
in there myself.

23:28.913 --> 23:32.000
[door opens]

23:32.043 --> 23:33.869
[door closes]

23:41.086 --> 23:42.260
Good read?

23:42.304 --> 23:43.478
Well, Metro did
a fine job

23:43.521 --> 23:45.782
of interrogating
our young Mr. Peyton.

23:45.826 --> 23:50.434
Yeah, but...

23:50.478 --> 23:52.913
I reexamined
the victim, and while

23:52.956 --> 23:55.304
most of the D.C. coroner's
findings are accurate,

23:55.347 --> 23:56.826
they did make one egregious

23:56.869 --> 23:59.347
if somewhat understandable
mistake--

23:59.391 --> 24:01.739
the cause of death.

24:03.434 --> 24:05.391
Guy was axed to death, Ducky.

24:05.434 --> 24:10.043
Yeah, well, I created
a Beauchene skull

24:10.086 --> 24:13.478
using the pieces
of the colonel's cranium.

24:13.521 --> 24:16.173
While most of these fractures

24:16.217 --> 24:19.260
are clean

24:19.304 --> 24:22.652
and linear--
clearly made by the ax--

24:22.695 --> 24:25.956
this indentation was caused

24:26.000 --> 24:28.391
by something blunt and circular.

24:28.434 --> 24:30.391
Two different kinds
of wounds.

24:30.434 --> 24:32.434
The cause of death can
still be classified

24:32.478 --> 24:38.043
as blunt force trauma,
but just not from an ax.

24:38.086 --> 24:40.043
Somebody was trying to cover up
the real cause of death?

24:40.086 --> 24:43.695
Well, that's hard
to determine, but, uh,

24:43.739 --> 24:44.782
if I could speculate...

24:44.826 --> 24:46.826
Oh, speculate, Duck.

24:46.869 --> 24:48.086
Nick could easily

24:48.130 --> 24:52.086
have hit his father
with this first object,

24:52.130 --> 24:54.695
and then, in
his drug-addled

24:54.739 --> 24:59.391
fugue, proceeded to butcher
his father's body with the ax,

24:59.434 --> 25:01.304
or it could also mean...

25:01.347 --> 25:04.304
That somebody was just trying
to make it look that way.

25:04.347 --> 25:06.043
In an effort to frame the boy.

25:09.565 --> 25:11.521
What do you got?

25:11.565 --> 25:13.652
Other than my respect
and adulation

25:13.695 --> 25:16.782
for the human's ability
to engineer teeny-tiny parts

25:16.826 --> 25:18.652
made of nothing
but sand?

25:18.695 --> 25:19.869
GIBBS:
Is it dead or alive?

25:19.913 --> 25:21.347
It's neither.

25:21.391 --> 25:23.217
It's like a
zombie, Gibbs.

25:23.260 --> 25:26.347
If you don't kill the
brain, it doesn't die,

25:26.391 --> 25:27.913
so we were able
to transplant

25:27.956 --> 25:29.826
the flash memory chip.

25:29.869 --> 25:31.826
Dr. McFrankenstein,

25:31.869 --> 25:34.217
if you please.

25:34.260 --> 25:37.260
So the colonel had set up
an anonymous e-mail account

25:37.304 --> 25:39.434
that only he and one
other person knew about.

25:39.478 --> 25:40.913
Looks like Peyton
had a friend.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.260
ABBY:
Dr. Ellen Gracey, Gibbs.

25:43.304 --> 25:45.826
A very passionate person
that sent

25:45.869 --> 25:47.782
a series
of romantic messages.

25:47.826 --> 25:49.782
That is Nick's
psychologist

25:49.826 --> 25:51.782
from rehab.

25:51.826 --> 25:53.869
McGEE:
She had a relationship
with our victim, boss,

25:53.913 --> 25:55.173
something she failed to mention
when we talked to her.

25:55.217 --> 25:56.391
And...

25:56.434 --> 25:58.304
that's not all
she failed to mention.

25:58.347 --> 25:59.869
Timothy.

25:59.913 --> 26:02.217
I pulled Dr. Gracey's
phone records.

26:02.260 --> 26:04.608
She received a call
from a gas station phone

26:04.652 --> 26:06.652
two blocks away
from the crime scene.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.347
When?
Ten minutes
after the murder.

26:08.391 --> 26:10.043
But there's no cameras

26:10.086 --> 26:11.652
in the vicinity,
no way of knowing

26:11.695 --> 26:14.391
who called her.

26:14.434 --> 26:15.826
Well, yeah, there is,
there's one way.

26:15.869 --> 26:17.478
Take Ziva with you.

26:21.652 --> 26:23.391
I lied.

26:23.434 --> 26:24.391
We know.

26:24.434 --> 26:25.608
Question is, why?

26:29.130 --> 26:32.130
I started seeing Nick's father
about a year ago...

26:32.173 --> 26:35.434
How come you didn't
mention it before?

26:35.478 --> 26:37.391
Because it's unethical,
unprofessional.

26:37.434 --> 26:40.739
It compromises doctor-
patient efficacy.

26:40.782 --> 26:43.000
Did Nick know you were having
a relationship with his father?

26:46.478 --> 26:47.956
Who called you
the night of the murder?

26:50.086 --> 26:52.000
We know that
someone called you

26:52.043 --> 26:54.130
from a public phone.

26:56.086 --> 26:58.173
[gasping quietly]

26:58.217 --> 27:00.652
I was with a patient;
it went to my voicemail.

27:00.695 --> 27:02.173
Who was it?

27:06.391 --> 27:07.521
Nick.

27:07.565 --> 27:09.739
We're gonna need
to hear that message.

27:13.217 --> 27:14.521
Doctor...

27:14.565 --> 27:15.826
we can get a warrant.

27:15.869 --> 27:18.695
No.

27:23.913 --> 27:26.043
Dr. Gracey...

27:26.086 --> 27:28.043
it's Nick.

27:28.086 --> 27:30.652
Wh-Where are you?

27:30.695 --> 27:32.521
Where are you?

27:32.565 --> 27:35.043
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

27:35.086 --> 27:35.869
[Gracey sobs]

27:35.913 --> 27:37.652
He's dead!

27:44.608 --> 27:47.000
Everything ready?

27:49.217 --> 27:51.434
It's just like
the one he used.

27:51.478 --> 27:52.652
Showtime.

27:52.695 --> 27:55.739
Bringing down a kid,
Leon, not a tree.

28:06.478 --> 28:08.782
Nick, I'm NCIS Director
Leon Vance.

28:08.826 --> 28:11.217
Did you kill your father
with this ax?

28:11.260 --> 28:13.478
No, I didn't.

28:13.521 --> 28:16.000
I want you to think
before you speak

28:16.043 --> 28:18.521
[over speaker]:
because my patience is
starting to wear thin.

28:18.565 --> 28:19.913
Have you ever seen
this ax before?

28:22.043 --> 28:23.000
Look at me.

28:23.043 --> 28:25.043
You ever seen it?

28:25.086 --> 28:27.434
I've never seen that ax.

28:27.478 --> 28:29.304
I don't like being lied to.

28:29.347 --> 28:32.304
I bet your father
didn't either, did he?

28:32.347 --> 28:34.173
Did he?

28:35.565 --> 28:37.217
He was a Marine.

28:37.260 --> 28:39.956
He was a hero.
He was a man.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.652
But his son,

28:42.695 --> 28:46.086
his only child was
a failure.

28:46.130 --> 28:47.739
How you think that made him
feel, Nick?

28:47.782 --> 28:48.739
I don't know.

28:48.782 --> 28:50.304
Ashamed, embarrassed,
angry?

28:51.739 --> 28:53.000
My father loved me.

28:53.043 --> 28:54.565
Really?

28:54.608 --> 28:56.782
What about your mom, Nick?
Did she love you, too?

28:56.826 --> 28:58.652
Yes.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.347
Then why
did she leave you?

29:00.391 --> 29:02.652
Come to think of it,
why'd your father leave you?

29:02.695 --> 29:04.739
Was it to serve
his country?

29:04.782 --> 29:06.304
Or was it just to get the hell
away from you

29:06.347 --> 29:08.347
because you were a burden?

29:08.391 --> 29:10.434
He put you in rehab
three times,

29:10.478 --> 29:12.608
and you couldn't
pull it off.

29:12.652 --> 29:14.304
Dropout, unemployed,
an addict;

29:14.347 --> 29:16.173
you were a failure
in every way.

29:16.217 --> 29:18.043
Where's Agent Gibbs?You know what I think?

29:18.086 --> 29:20.608
I think he didn't love you
so much as he pitied you.

29:20.652 --> 29:23.000
Reminded you of what a failure
you were every day.

29:23.043 --> 29:27.304
So you took that ax, and in one
instant, you became successful

29:27.347 --> 29:28.565
at something, Nick!No!

29:39.217 --> 29:41.217
I'm proud of you, Nick...

29:41.260 --> 29:43.217
even if your father isn't.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.521
It's a hard thing to do,
to kill a man.

29:49.086 --> 29:51.217
Do you remember?

29:51.260 --> 29:52.739
You remember how it felt?

29:52.782 --> 29:55.304
Think back.

29:57.217 --> 30:01.217
[on recording; sobbing]:
Oh, my God, he's dead!

30:01.260 --> 30:04.913
I-I just left the house!

30:04.956 --> 30:06.521
Blood everywhere!

30:06.565 --> 30:08.391
He-he's dead!

30:08.434 --> 30:12.391
Oh, oh, God, what have I done?

30:13.521 --> 30:15.652
VANCE:
Do you remember now?

30:15.695 --> 30:18.304
You went to the house,
you and your father fought,

30:18.347 --> 30:20.608
he turned his back,
you hit him,

30:20.652 --> 30:22.652
he went down,
and then you got the ax.

30:22.695 --> 30:25.260
Hell, you came this far,
you had to finish it.

30:25.304 --> 30:28.391
Did you finish it, Nick?
Did you want to finish it?

30:28.434 --> 30:29.869
I'm not sure.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.782
He blamed you for
you mother leaving.

30:31.826 --> 30:33.478
He blamed you for
ruining his life.

30:33.521 --> 30:36.000
And then he did the worst
thing a father could do:

30:36.043 --> 30:37.391
he gave up on you.

30:37.434 --> 30:39.782
How the hell do you know?Because he told me!

30:40.347 --> 30:42.652
Your father was
a friend of mine!

30:44.652 --> 30:48.086
He was an instructor
at the Naval War College.

30:48.130 --> 30:50.304
He was a man that I respected.

30:50.347 --> 30:52.000
He was a man that I admired.

30:52.043 --> 30:53.347
He was a man!

30:53.391 --> 30:55.478
He told you to get out
of his house!

30:55.521 --> 30:57.652
He told you to get
out of his life!

30:57.695 --> 31:00.565
I was never in his life,
the Corps was.

31:00.608 --> 31:02.478
God bless the U.S. Marines.

31:02.521 --> 31:03.608
Damn right!

31:07.869 --> 31:10.000
Is that how it felt, Nick?

31:10.043 --> 31:11.782
To know that you'd
never have

31:11.826 --> 31:13.043
to deal with him
ever again.

31:13.086 --> 31:14.434
It felt good,
didn't it?
Yes!

31:14.478 --> 31:15.565
And once you hit him,

31:15.608 --> 31:16.739
you just kept
swinging, didn't you?

31:16.782 --> 31:17.956
Yes!

31:18.000 --> 31:19.086
Go ahead, say it, say it.
Say the words!

31:19.130 --> 31:23.260
I killed him,
and I'm glad he's dead!

31:24.260 --> 31:26.000
That's all we needed
to know, Nick-- thank you.

31:49.913 --> 31:51.782
Call the U.S. Attorney's Office.

31:51.826 --> 31:55.043
About that favor?

31:55.086 --> 31:56.086
Tell 'em we finally got
our confession.

31:59.173 --> 32:03.043
Yeah, well... there's just
one problem, Leon.

32:05.478 --> 32:08.217
I don't believe him.

32:18.217 --> 32:21.173
VANCE [on video]:
Is that what it felt like, Nick?

32:21.217 --> 32:23.086
Knowing that
you'd never have

32:23.130 --> 32:24.652
to deal with that man again?
It felt good, didn't it?

32:24.695 --> 32:26.260
Yes.
And once you
hit him,

32:26.304 --> 32:28.000
you just kept
swinging, didn't you?Yes!

32:28.043 --> 32:29.652
VANCE: Say it. Say it!
Say the words!

32:29.695 --> 32:31.043
NICK:
I killed him!

32:31.086 --> 32:33.000
And I'm glad he's dead.

32:33.043 --> 32:35.130
Sure looked like a confession.

32:35.173 --> 32:36.956
Sure sounded
like a confession.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.956
It was clearly
a confession.

32:40.000 --> 32:40.913
Except Gibbs
doesn't buy it.

32:40.956 --> 32:42.304
He must have a reason.

32:42.347 --> 32:43.739
A very good reason.

32:43.782 --> 32:46.695
[sighs]
So what are we missing?

32:46.739 --> 32:48.217
Yeah, I'd like to know
the same thing.

32:52.521 --> 32:53.739
Gibbs.

33:01.304 --> 33:02.565
Not here.

33:11.565 --> 33:13.086
GIBBS: When were you
going to tell me?

33:13.130 --> 33:14.434
I wasn't.

33:14.478 --> 33:16.391
You don't think it
was a conflict of interest

33:16.434 --> 33:17.826
that you knew the victim?

33:17.869 --> 33:19.695
No. The kid confessed.He didn't do it.

33:19.739 --> 33:21.260
How the hell do you know that?!

33:21.304 --> 33:23.652
Because, before you went
all Paul Bunyan on him in there,

33:23.695 --> 33:25.565
he couldn't even look at
an image of his father.

33:25.608 --> 33:27.521
Because he hated him,
Gibbs. He resented him.

33:27.565 --> 33:28.913
We know that.No. No. He didn't hate him.

33:28.956 --> 33:29.913
He was afraid of him.

33:29.956 --> 33:31.304
All the more reason to kill him.

33:31.347 --> 33:33.173
The first time he ever
faced his father

33:33.217 --> 33:34.478
in his life was in that room.

33:34.521 --> 33:36.565
And he did it
because you did it for him.

33:36.608 --> 33:38.695
Gibbs, we have
a taped confession!

33:38.739 --> 33:41.000
You swung an axe at a
scared kid, Director Vance.

33:41.043 --> 33:44.086
One person on a jury finds
coercion in that, he will walk.

33:44.130 --> 33:45.260
His confession trumps your gut.

33:45.304 --> 33:46.695
I'm calling the U.S. Attorney.

33:46.739 --> 33:47.956
This wasn't a favor.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.130
This was an execution.

33:50.782 --> 33:52.913
And he didn't do it.

33:52.956 --> 33:53.956
Where are you going?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.478
To have a talk.

33:55.521 --> 33:56.782
Talk with who?!

34:04.217 --> 34:05.913
Thought you were a vegan.

34:05.956 --> 34:08.000
What?

34:09.173 --> 34:10.391
BeltWay Burgers, hot dogs.

34:13.260 --> 34:16.347
You're either a bad liar
or you're a bad vegan.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.304
I don't know what I am anymore.

34:21.347 --> 34:23.391
You're hungry, Nick.
Eat the hot dog.

34:29.086 --> 34:31.869
Why'd you confess?

34:31.913 --> 34:34.521
I don't remember enough
to prove I didn't,

34:34.565 --> 34:37.260
and you've shown me
enough to prove I did.

34:37.304 --> 34:39.043
So I did it.

34:39.086 --> 34:40.391
Right?

34:42.347 --> 34:44.000
I don't think so.

34:46.304 --> 34:48.782
I can't even look
at a picture of him

34:48.826 --> 34:52.000
because I remember seeing
his body on the ground.

34:53.130 --> 34:54.956
Why do I remember seeing that?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.521
Because you did.

34:56.565 --> 34:58.695
You came home
that night,

34:58.739 --> 35:00.000
and you found his body.

35:01.173 --> 35:04.608
You add the pills, the guilt,

35:04.652 --> 35:06.956
years of fighting.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.608
You were high.

35:09.652 --> 35:11.260
You ran.

35:12.695 --> 35:14.217
You're giving me a free pass.

35:16.260 --> 35:17.956
How do you know
I'm not playing you?

35:19.173 --> 35:20.869
Maybe I don't.

35:26.130 --> 35:27.608
Let's just talk.

35:27.652 --> 35:28.782
About what?

35:32.652 --> 35:34.217
Tell me about your mom.

35:36.086 --> 35:39.521
She always
looked out for me.

35:39.565 --> 35:42.347
I... I loved her.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.347
Why'd she leave?

35:44.391 --> 35:46.347
Me.

35:46.391 --> 35:49.434
I... I'd steal all her meds

35:49.478 --> 35:51.347
and get...
get in all kinds of trouble.

35:51.391 --> 35:54.000
Dad was deployed
for months at a time.

35:55.043 --> 35:57.217
She couldn't take it.

35:57.260 --> 35:59.000
You went to rehab.

35:59.043 --> 36:00.695
Dad made me.

36:03.173 --> 36:05.086
And... my girlfriend.

36:05.130 --> 36:08.043
She was there
trying to get clean.

36:08.086 --> 36:10.956
I missed her.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.434
So you weren't there
trying to help yourself?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.826
She'd bring
stuff in-- pills.

36:17.869 --> 36:20.739
We'd sneak out
at night, get high.

36:26.608 --> 36:28.782
So where's your
girlfriend now?

36:30.521 --> 36:31.913
Megan died six months ago.

36:33.086 --> 36:35.826
Overdose.

36:35.869 --> 36:38.130
One of those nights
at the clinic.

36:38.173 --> 36:39.565
[sighs]

36:39.608 --> 36:42.652
God, she... she was
my best friend.

36:42.695 --> 36:44.695
I mean, she grew up
next-door to me.

36:50.608 --> 36:52.217
GIBBS:
Your daughter, Megan.

36:52.260 --> 36:53.695
Top of her class.

36:53.739 --> 36:55.260
Looking forward
to college.

36:55.304 --> 36:56.434
Looking forward
to life.

36:56.478 --> 36:59.217
And then Nick happened.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.739
Next thing you know,
she's OD'd.

37:02.782 --> 37:04.695
She's dead.

37:09.826 --> 37:11.478
Yeah, that's...
that's my backyard.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.304
So what?
That's a lot
of wood.

37:13.347 --> 37:14.434
Where's your axe?

37:17.478 --> 37:20.347
I... I don't know.

37:20.391 --> 37:21.826
You're the only witness

37:21.869 --> 37:23.652
that puts Nick
at the scene of the crime.

37:23.695 --> 37:24.913
Are you accusing me?

37:24.956 --> 37:26.043
Nick showed up.

37:26.086 --> 37:28.869
He was high,
and you confronted him.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.217
I lost my temper.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.217
I hate that punk.

37:31.260 --> 37:33.043
What he did.

37:33.086 --> 37:35.956
And then his daddy has to come
out and his rescue him?

37:36.000 --> 37:38.304
He was protecting him.
He was defending him.

37:38.347 --> 37:39.913
He was enabling him.

37:39.956 --> 37:42.000
He should have had Nick's ass
thrown in jail years ago.

37:42.043 --> 37:43.782
Yeah, that would've taught

37:43.826 --> 37:45.347
the little bastard
a lesson, at least.

37:46.826 --> 37:50.260
And kept him away from
my little girl, yeah.

37:50.304 --> 37:52.434
You don't blame Nick, do you?

37:52.478 --> 37:54.347
You blame the
colonel, right?

37:54.391 --> 37:58.086
She's dead because
he was a lousy father.

37:58.130 --> 38:00.695
He killed my girl.

38:00.739 --> 38:02.434
You made him pay for it.

38:03.608 --> 38:05.478
I want a lawyer.

38:13.652 --> 38:16.304
You're going to need one.

38:16.347 --> 38:17.695
I didn't do it.

38:17.739 --> 38:19.521
I don't care what that kid
or his mother said.

38:19.565 --> 38:21.956
The mother's gone.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.434
Well, I guess she's back.

38:24.478 --> 38:26.478
I saw her next-door
last night,

38:26.521 --> 38:27.913
after your people left.

38:27.956 --> 38:30.173
Let herself into the house.

38:36.304 --> 38:38.217
GIBBS:
McGee.

38:38.260 --> 38:39.913
Pull the phone records
from the Peyton house.

38:39.956 --> 38:42.000
Uh, already did when
we took over the case.

38:42.043 --> 38:43.869
Nothing unusual.

38:43.913 --> 38:45.043
Phone records
for the past 24 hours.

38:45.086 --> 38:48.478
But Nick's been here.Do it again.

38:57.086 --> 38:59.565
Oh, there's six incoming calls

38:59.608 --> 39:01.652
to the house
since yesterday.

39:01.695 --> 39:04.000
All from the same
prepaid cell.

39:04.043 --> 39:05.695
Peyton's been dead
two weeks.

39:05.739 --> 39:06.652
You'd think
whoever is calling

39:06.695 --> 39:08.565
would have heard
about it by now.

39:08.608 --> 39:10.608
Calls weren't
for the father.

39:18.260 --> 39:19.869
Hello, baby.

39:21.260 --> 39:22.869
Oh, my God.

39:22.913 --> 39:24.043
Look how tall you got.

39:25.608 --> 39:28.521
I missed you so much.

39:30.608 --> 39:32.391
I've been here
the whole time.

39:32.434 --> 39:33.739
Why did you leave?

39:36.782 --> 39:40.434
Well, um...

39:40.478 --> 39:43.826
I-I-I just didn't think
I could be a good mom back then.

39:43.869 --> 39:45.565
But I can now.

39:45.608 --> 39:47.304
[kisses]

39:47.347 --> 39:48.956
Are you back
on your meds?

39:51.086 --> 39:53.869
Um... n-no.

39:53.913 --> 39:56.652
They-they, um...
they made me worse.

39:57.826 --> 39:59.000
No, they didn't.

40:00.782 --> 40:03.173
I just need you back
in my life again.

40:03.217 --> 40:04.826
You're my baby.

40:07.869 --> 40:09.521
When did you get back?

40:12.478 --> 40:15.173
Two weeks ago, I think.

40:15.217 --> 40:19.347
I-I-I... I came by the
house one night and...

40:19.391 --> 40:22.565
you'd just left and...

40:25.913 --> 40:27.869
I-I wanted to talk
to your father.

40:31.434 --> 40:32.782
What happened, Mom?

40:32.826 --> 40:34.956
I'm so sorry, baby.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.086
[crying]

40:37.130 --> 40:41.043
I didn't, I didn't mean
for it to end this way.

40:41.086 --> 40:43.478
[voice breaking]:
Mom, no.

40:43.521 --> 40:46.043
He said that I wasn't a
part of your life anymore.

40:48.434 --> 40:49.521
And that's not true.

40:51.521 --> 40:53.000
Not anymore.

40:53.043 --> 40:55.217
So we fought and...

40:58.782 --> 41:00.913
I-I-I picked something up.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.478
I really didn't think
I hit him that hard.

41:05.521 --> 41:08.652
Mom... Mom, you should
stop talking, please.

41:08.695 --> 41:10.869
And I panicked,
and I... I just...

41:10.913 --> 41:13.695
I went and got an axe
from next-door.

41:13.739 --> 41:15.391
And, you know,
I thought that...

41:15.434 --> 41:17.695
that they were going to
think maybe you did it.

41:17.739 --> 41:21.913
And I had to
protect you, baby.

41:21.956 --> 41:24.956
By making them think
that Mr. Stafford did it?

41:26.652 --> 41:28.869
I-I had to protect you, Nick.

41:30.869 --> 41:33.826
You should have
told the truth.

41:35.434 --> 41:37.086
What is that?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.043
Nicky?

41:42.086 --> 41:43.695
Wh...

41:45.086 --> 41:47.260
[sobbing]

41:47.304 --> 41:48.478
I love you, Mom.

41:48.521 --> 41:50.434
I'm sorry.Wait, Nicky...

41:50.478 --> 41:52.000
Where you going?

42:06.086 --> 42:07.956
[sobbing]

42:11.391 --> 42:12.782
That's it.
Done.

42:15.043 --> 42:17.086
Me, too.So who gets these now?

42:17.130 --> 42:18.478
I don't care.
Just get them out of here.

42:18.521 --> 42:20.739
TONY, McGEE and ZIVA:
On it.

42:22.304 --> 42:24.391
TONY:
Hey, boss.

42:24.434 --> 42:26.260
Think the kid's
going to be okay?Don't know.

42:26.304 --> 42:27.565
It's up to him now.

42:36.086 --> 42:37.695
[cell phone ringing]

42:42.304 --> 42:43.608
Vance.

42:43.652 --> 42:45.000
Director Vance.
It's E.J.

42:45.043 --> 42:46.000
Hello, Agent Barrett.

42:46.043 --> 42:47.043
I just got your message.

42:47.086 --> 42:48.260
I'm glad you called.
