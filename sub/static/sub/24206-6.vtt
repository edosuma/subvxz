[dog barking, baby crying afar]

00:16.265 --> 00:18.101
Goddamn fucking bastards!

00:18.184 --> 00:20.103
What the hell, Ricky?

00:20.186 --> 00:24.649
You were supposed to be fixing
this goddamn bathroom, not these two...

00:25.233 --> 00:27.277
fucking brained ass-clowns!

00:27.360 --> 00:29.362
Look at what they've done!

00:29.446 --> 00:31.197
Oh, I'm gone two hours,

00:31.281 --> 00:33.950
I come back and find it
twice as bad as it was!

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
Jesus H. Christ!

00:36.828 --> 00:38.246
What the fuck, boys?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.957
What the fuck actually goes on
in your fucking heads?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.542
When I said to tap into the kitchen sink

00:42.625 --> 00:44.544
and run the fucking new water lines
to the bathroom,

00:44.627 --> 00:46.880
I assume you two fucktards would run
them under the trailers!

00:46.963 --> 00:48.131
What the fuck is this?

00:48.214 --> 00:50.967
How the fuck did you think
this would be okay?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.260
Carpet, dude.

00:52.677 --> 00:53.595
Carpet?

00:53.678 --> 00:56.181
Clean this the fuck up,
get the fuck under the trailer

00:56.264 --> 00:57.640
and run the lines properly.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.726
Under? But there's cow shit down there.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.937
I don't fucking give a fuck.
Get it done! Marguerite, I'm sorry.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.522
Even I didn't know they were
this fucking dumb. Wow, boys!

01:05.607 --> 01:08.109
Well, you should've asked me.
I knew.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.155
[Bubbles] Let's go, Ricky.
We're gonna be late for the visitation.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.032
All right... I'll be back in a bit.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.118
We're gonna have this fucking finished
by tonight, I promise.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.121
I'll believe that when I see it,
dick flap!

01:20.205 --> 01:22.499
[theme music]

02:02.413 --> 02:05.250
Here, Julian. Conway Kitty
was sleeping on the back of it,

02:05.333 --> 02:06.876
but I got it all cleaned and pressed.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.586
All right. Thanks, man.

02:08.669 --> 02:11.464
Now, when you wear it, make sure
you button it up properly.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.717
-Okay, I'll do that.
-Judges like a nice, clean appearance.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.344
-All right.
-We are gonna light it

02:16.427 --> 02:18.555
the fuck up tonight, man!
Right after court.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.973
You're fucking right.

02:20.765 --> 02:21.808
[sigh]

02:21.891 --> 02:23.977
Boys, I've got to get
the fuck out of here.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.688
It's nothing the way it used to be
in here, I'm telling you.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.149
It's all changed. I mean,
there's barely any booze.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.608
There's a bunch of punks running around

02:30.692 --> 02:33.069
all fucking jacked up
on pills and steroids,

02:33.153 --> 02:36.239
and not to mention the new guards
in here that are a bunch of dicks!

02:36.322 --> 02:38.783
-Julian...
-What the fuck, man? That sucks.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.410
Still some good weed
and hash though?

02:40.493 --> 02:42.662
Yeah, there's a bit,
but it's fucking expensive.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.498
But enough whining about me.
How the fuck are you guys doing?

02:45.582 --> 02:48.626
I've been fucking great, man. I finished
the contract at the park for Barb,

02:48.710 --> 02:51.087
made a little money,
fucking bought a car. It's badass.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.964
-[Julian] Nice!
-I'm getting Marguerite's bathroom back.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.216
She'll stop shitting and showering
in my fucking trailer.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.595
Good for you, man, good for you.
What about you, Bubs?

02:58.678 --> 03:02.640
I'm just concentrating
on the beer, Julian, laying low.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.227
[whispering]
The whole helicopter thing is over.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.021
They're not looking at it anymore.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.148
-Nice.
-And Steve Rogers is doing a lot better.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.941
I went to the hospital,
brought him flowers.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.568
He doesn't suspect anything.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.862
Bubs, why would you go
do something stupid like that?

03:15.945 --> 03:17.530
-What the... Are you kidding me?
-What?

03:17.614 --> 03:19.365
That's stupid!
You're just fucking begging

03:19.449 --> 03:21.034
to get fucking caught
and thrown in jail.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.745
Sorry, sorry!
Yeah, give me more advice,

03:23.828 --> 03:25.455
Mr. I'm-sitting-in-fucking-jail-

03:25.538 --> 03:28.374
for-running-a-crime-ring-at-the-mall-
involving-children.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.627
-Shh!
-Yes, bestow your knowledge on me.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.212
I said I was sorry for that, okay?

03:33.296 --> 03:35.381
I got greedy, man. I was dumb.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.217
[sighing]

03:37.634 --> 03:40.345
But I'm gonna get my shit together,
okay? I promise you that.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.973
I've just got to get the fuck out of here
and get some real booze into me.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.478
What's the news?

03:51.314 --> 03:52.690
Fuck.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.401
-What?
-We have a serious fucking problem.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.404
What the fuck are you talking about?
You said you had this all figured out.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.406
-"Slam-dunker," you called it.
-Yeah, I did.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.743
I had a deal with the prosecutor.
A buddy of mine, owed me a favour.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.496
Then the stupid bastard goes
and gets arrested yesterday.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.122
-Cocaine charges.
-[Bubbles] Oh, my fuck!

04:08.206 --> 04:11.251
Now the new prosecutor's
apparently a real hard-ass,

04:11.334 --> 04:13.628
a hungry up-and-coming bitch.

04:13.711 --> 04:17.048
-Great.
-Yeah, oh, yeah. The slimy... dragon queen

04:17.130 --> 04:20.468
is gonna go for the maximum:
five to seven years.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.929
What? Five to seven y...

04:23.012 --> 04:26.474
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-Yeah, well, I hate to say this,

04:26.557 --> 04:28.726
-but my advice to you is to plead guilty.
-Huh!

04:28.810 --> 04:31.104
I could probably get it down
to two or three...

04:31.187 --> 04:33.189
you know, out in a year
on good behaviour.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.984
-[Ricky] It's better than fucking seven.
-Are you out of your fucking mind?

04:36.067 --> 04:39.028
He's talking about years, Ricky,
not months!

04:39.112 --> 04:41.322
Two to three fucking...
That can't happen.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.408
That can't happen.
There's got to be another fucking way.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.909
Okay, okay, okay.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.620
I've got an idea,

04:47.704 --> 04:49.372
and it's a long shot.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.916
Longer than Huey Lewis's cock.

04:52.542 --> 04:57.088
You gotta get the mall security
manager to lie in court.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.090
Getting this case thrown out
is the only way

04:59.173 --> 05:01.384
Julian is not gonna go to jail today.

05:01.467 --> 05:05.013
Now, if we go that angle,
it's gonna be another eight...

05:05.096 --> 05:08.266
no, let's say five grand for me, okay?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.518
Now, trials are not cheap.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.562
[voice breaking]
But, frankly...

05:12.645 --> 05:15.231
don't you think it's important
that we get our fellow out of here?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.358
-Would you cut that bullshit?
-All right.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.153
[Bubbles whispering]
Nobody's buying your fucking tears.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.780
There's gotta be some other way to...

05:22.864 --> 05:25.199
So you're saying we've got to do
a bunch more illegal stuff

05:25.283 --> 05:27.243
-to deal with this fucking illegal...
-Bubs, listen.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.703
We've got to fucking try, don't we?

05:28.786 --> 05:30.288
-We've got to fucking try.
-Yeah.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.040
[hard sigh]
Yes!

05:32.123 --> 05:34.250
[Julian] Ricky. Rick, go see Lahey.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.128
See what money you can get from him, okay?
Whatever you can get, man.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.713
-He owes us big time, man.
-Yeah.

05:38.796 --> 05:42.091
[Ricky] I'll do it... Whatever the fuck
it takes, me and Bubbles will do it.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.260
-You're not going to fucking jail today.
-Right on.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.303
Thanks, boys.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.471
Right on.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.140
-Two grand.
-Two grand?

05:49.223 --> 05:50.808
-Yes.
-For lying in court?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.602
You're asking for perjury!

05:52.685 --> 05:54.771
Three grand, and you can take him
in the back room

05:54.854 --> 05:56.689
-and do whatever you want.
-What? No fucking way!

05:56.773 --> 05:58.316
-Five grand.
-Five?

05:58.399 --> 06:01.694
Yes. Five Gs, and Bubbles has to grease

06:01.778 --> 06:03.988
the wheels on every fucking
cart in the mall!

06:04.072 --> 06:07.283
Oh, yeah, just...
that's a $480 value!

06:07.366 --> 06:09.660
-That's the deal.
-For fuck's sakes, fine. Done deal.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.246
Meet you outside the courthouse
before the trial.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.539
Fuck.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.584
[Bubbles whispering loudly]
Fucking prick!

06:16.876 --> 06:18.044
Ricky, we can't do this.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.922
Between him and Steinberg,
now we're at 10 fucking grand.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.673
$10,000!

06:22.757 --> 06:24.550
I know, but it's less than a million.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.635
[sighing]

06:25.718 --> 06:27.011
It is, isn't it?

06:28.763 --> 06:29.847
Yes.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.480
-Where the fuck is Lahey?
-None of your frigging business, Ricky.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.525
-Is that right? Where is he, bacon clit?
-[glass shattering]

06:40.608 --> 06:41.567
[shouting] Where is he?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.736
[Lahey, slurring]
What the hell's going on out here?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.738
Julian said that you owe him
a lot of money,

06:45.822 --> 06:47.615
so let's go with the fucking money
right now.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.534
What the hell are you
talking about, Rickles?

06:49.617 --> 06:52.495
It's for Julian. We need it
to get him out of jail. Let's go.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.997
If we don't help him, he's gonna do
five to seven fucking years.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.042
Let's go with some fucking money right
now or I spray this whole deck with piss.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.544
-Unfortunately, Ricky, you are too late.
-Really?

06:59.627 --> 07:02.380
Yeah. Mr. Lahey lost
all of our frigging money.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.674
-Randy!
-Yeah! He went to the track

07:04.757 --> 07:06.968
while I was in the shower
getting cleaned up,

07:07.051 --> 07:08.928
and he went and lost it all!

07:09.011 --> 07:10.096
Randy!

07:10.179 --> 07:12.932
-It's true, Mr. Lahey.
-Yeah, well, whether it's true or not...

07:13.015 --> 07:16.602
I don't wanna see Julian
go to that shit hole for seven years.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.897
Listen, Randy's right.
We don't have any fucking money.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.732
I-I've maxed out my credit cards

07:21.816 --> 07:24.444
and I don't have a fucking penny
to my name!

07:24.777 --> 07:27.280
-[George] You heard them.
-[gun clicking]

07:27.780 --> 07:29.657
Now get the fuck out of here.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.200
And if you guys are smart,

07:31.284 --> 07:33.202
you'll forget
all about your friend Julian.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.996
Let him rot in jail
where he belongs.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.206
Why don't you shut
your pie hole, there, penis nose?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.250
Let me promise you this:
we're gonna have 10 grand

07:39.333 --> 07:41.544
by the time he gets to court.
We're gonna get him out.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.797
When that happens, he's gonna come
back here, make all your fucking lives

07:44.881 --> 07:47.341
a living, fucking hell.
I can't wait to see that, boys.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.260
And you got a shitty beard.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.555
[Mr. Lahey] Ooh, tough.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.600
What if they do raise the money
and get him out of a jail?

07:55.683 --> 07:58.811
-Our lives could be fucked, Mr. Lahey.
-Oh, relax, Randy.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.981
As if those shitiots could come up
with 10 grand today.

08:02.064 --> 08:02.982
-[drunken laughter]
-[George] Jim.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.193
-What?
-This has always been your downfall.

08:05.276 --> 08:09.489
Always underestimate those guys,
always end up getting fucked.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.242
Well, I guess you better do
something about it then,

08:13.326 --> 08:17.288
eh, Georgie porgy,
pudding-y pie?

08:18.789 --> 08:19.916
Already on it.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.377
[on loudspeaker]
Attention, attention.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.631
Everyone in Sunnyvale, we have a major
fucking situation on our hands.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.592
Julian could be going to jail
for seven fucking years

08:29.675 --> 08:32.220
unless we can come up with $10,000
in the next few hours.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.890
We need fucking donations of money
or shit we can pawn for money.

08:35.972 --> 08:37.892
Let's go, people!
We've got to fucking pull together here.

08:37.975 --> 08:41.270
We will take furniture,
electronics, fucking jewellery.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.105
Cash money's always good.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.566
Anything we can pawn for...
Hold on a sec, Bubs.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.110
Here comes some shit.
I'm not sure what the fuck it is.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.987
Thank you very much.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.076
-Decent.
-We will take hockey gear, fishing rods,

08:55.159 --> 08:57.411
-anything we can fucking pawn for money.
-Cash.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.372
Attention, attention.
Cash definitely.

08:59.747 --> 09:03.459
People of Sunnyvale, our beloved Julian,
sexiest man in Sunnyvale,

09:03.543 --> 09:06.045
is fucking gonna go to jail
for seven fucking years

09:06.128 --> 09:09.257
unless we come up with $10,000
in the next few hours.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.758
We need your fucking donations.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.885
Thanks for all your fucking help,

09:12.969 --> 09:15.179
all you cheap motherfuckers!
You couldn't give a shit?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.390
Remember this next time
you fucking need our help!

09:17.473 --> 09:19.350
-Ricky...
-[muttering]

09:19.809 --> 09:21.519
Fuck! Ridiculous!

09:23.312 --> 09:24.814
[Tyrone] Man, most of this stuff
is garbage.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.108
-It ain't worth shit.
-I know it's not.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.986
Except somebody donated
a bunch of sex toys.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.320
Maybe it was Marguerite.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.282
It was Marguerite,
but it's not worth anything.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.118
Man, there's no way
we're gonna be able to make enough.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.453
There's, like, $100
worth of shit here if we're lucky.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.998
Well, you know what?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.499
There's only one other choice.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.377
Trin, go in the trailer, get all my masks,
four or five guns.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.547
We're gonna have to fucking rob a bank
or somewhere with a lot of money.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.924
Dad, what the fuck?
You are not robbing a fucking bank.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.718
What other choice
do we have right now, Trin?

09:53.801 --> 09:55.595
Ricky. Ricky, please, please.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.764
The last thing I fucking need
is my other best friend in jail.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.309
Please, we're not robbing a bank.
There's got to be something.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.811
Seriously, man. Think about
what you're saying, Rick. Come on, man.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.063
All right. What the hell
are we gonna do then, huh?

10:06.147 --> 10:07.690
Because this shit right here...

10:08.149 --> 10:10.776
[shouting] This shit ain't gonna
fucking cut it, is it?

10:10.860 --> 10:13.112
-[Bubbles] Ricky!
-We're fucked! We fucking blew it.

10:13.195 --> 10:16.824
[Bubbles] Ricky, just calm down.
Don't smash the stuff we do have!

10:17.074 --> 10:19.201
-[whimpering]
-[Sarah] Shit, you guys.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.787
-Check it out.
-Hang on, boys.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.081
Hey... Come on, everybody!

10:24.165 --> 10:27.585
[Alvena] This is all we could get
together, guys, but thank you so much

10:27.668 --> 10:29.837
for what you're doing for Julian.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.173
-[Ricky] Thanks...
-[Bubbles] Pile it up there, everybody.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.758
-Thank you.
-I notice you don't have anything.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.468
I just came to see what you got.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.179
-Yeah, we're gonna need that.
-Oh, for Jesus' sake! Take it.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.556
[Donnie screaming]
Will you take this fucking thing

10:40.640 --> 10:41.807
before I change my fucking mind?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.768
Calm down.
You don't have to give it away.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.770
[Donnie] Lost the fucking
remote anyway!

10:45.853 --> 10:48.481
Well, thanks. Fucking lunatic.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.691
Holy fuck, Ricky.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.568
We're not dead yet!

10:52.902 --> 10:54.695
I've got to say I'm pretty blown away.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.783
You know, everybody back at the park
rallying together for me...

10:59.075 --> 11:02.453
It kind of brings a tear to my eyes.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.623
Holy fuck. I've got to get
the fuck out of here.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.793
This place is full of guys like this.
They're all a bunch of idiots.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.128
Like, what do you want?
What the f...?

11:12.004 --> 11:14.256
Which is a shame,
it used to be so cool in here.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.343
Now it's just full of a bunch of dicks.
Like...

11:18.386 --> 11:20.346
Are you fucking kidding me, Jimmy?

11:22.556 --> 11:23.682
Animals!

11:28.354 --> 11:31.732
We hate dealing with the pawn shop owner.
He is a fucking son of a whore,

11:31.816 --> 11:33.359
but it's the only game in town,
unfortunately,

11:33.442 --> 11:35.277
so we've got no fucking choice.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.532
[engine turns off]

11:41.951 --> 11:44.245
[Bubbles] Ricky. Ricky.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.288
What are you doing
getting out the passenger door?

11:46.372 --> 11:47.248
[Ricky laughing]

11:47.331 --> 11:48.416
You know what?
Force of habitat...

11:48.499 --> 11:50.292
-[truck horn blaring]
-[Bubbles] Ricky! Ricky!

11:50.376 --> 11:52.294
-[crash]
-Jesus Christ!

11:52.962 --> 11:55.798
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-[Bubbles] Oh, my Jesus Murphy!

11:55.881 --> 11:58.509
Ricky! Oh, my Jesus Murphy!

11:58.592 --> 11:59.844
[man shouting indistinctly]

11:59.927 --> 12:01.387
What the fuck happened out here?

12:01.470 --> 12:02.638
Sorry about this.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.349
This was an accident.
It wasn't supposed to happen.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.103
Look, we've got a big load
of merchandise here, coming in,

12:09.186 --> 12:10.938
giving you the fucking dibs on it.

12:11.021 --> 12:15.109
Look, we got all this,
everything in the vehicles here.

12:15.192 --> 12:18.070
-We wanted to show it to you.
-You wanna sell or you wanna pawn?

12:18.154 --> 12:20.906
No, we are looking to sell
everything at once.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.908
-One big sale.
-All right, all right.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.578
Hey, let me see
what my pet orca thinks.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.330
Shamu! Give me a number.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.208
There's a lot of nice merchandise here.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.587
About 15...
and a bucket of chicken?

12:35.045 --> 12:37.965
15? Exactly what I was thinking.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.217
Hey, who knew whales could add, right?

12:40.301 --> 12:41.510
[Shamu] Hey!

12:41.594 --> 12:42.970
I heard that.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.931
Listen, you Don Corleone
motherfucker!

12:46.015 --> 12:48.434
I've had just about enough
of your bullying!

12:48.517 --> 12:50.603
Bullying?
I fucking complimented you!

12:50.686 --> 12:52.771
I said you were good in arithmetic.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.358
Excuse me, that better not be
a fucking real kitty you're holding there.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.487
Hey. Don't worry, it's not a real kitty.
If I gave him a real kitty,

12:59.570 --> 13:02.615
-he'd fucking eat it.
-Okay, whoa, whoa... 15 what?

13:03.365 --> 13:07.244
15 grand for the whole shooting match,
like he fucking just said.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.704
-[laughing]
-[Bubbles] 15 grand!

13:08.787 --> 13:10.247
Oh, my God, Ricky!

13:10.331 --> 13:12.333
-We did it, Bubs!
-We did it!

13:12.416 --> 13:13.709
-[giggling]
-Yeah, well, hang on.

13:13.792 --> 13:17.546
Listen, I've got to run numbers
on all these vehicles, all right?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.924
If they clear...

13:20.007 --> 13:23.010
-15 Gs, cash.
-What? Run num... No, no, wait a second.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.888
-No, the vehicles aren't part of the deal.
-No.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.432
Just the merchandise in the vehicles.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.852
-This swill?
-Yeah. Can we still do 15?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.480
I was gonna pay you
to fuckin' take it.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.816
A G note for all of it.
That's it.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.361
A grand? For all this?
Are you kidding me?

13:40.444 --> 13:42.530
That stuff's worth
way more than a grand!

13:42.613 --> 13:44.657
Well, then fucking keep it then.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.035
The vehicles or fuck off.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.164
Most of these fucking people,
they drive me fucking crazy, okay.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.668
They come in with shit, they think
it's worth three times more than it is

13:55.751 --> 13:57.836
because it's got sentimental value.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.340
Like, "Oooh, that belonged
to my grandmother!"

14:01.423 --> 14:04.343
Well, you know what?
Fuck you and fuck Grandma.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.470
Dig her up and fuck her too.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.638
[Frankie] Guys.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.267
I can't do the 15 Gs.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.309
-Fuck!
-Okay?

14:12.393 --> 14:15.271
The Caddy came back as stolen from Quebec.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.897
-What?
-Okay? And this piece of shit:

14:16.981 --> 14:18.691
who wants a three-door sedan?

14:18.774 --> 14:20.276
-All right?
-It's fucking still nice.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.443
Okay...

14:21.527 --> 14:24.697
The other three, I'll go nine grand.
That's it.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.659
We can't take nine grand,
we have to get at least to 10 grand.

14:28.742 --> 14:32.955
That's... I mean that Fiero alone,
that thing was a fucking official pace car

14:33.038 --> 14:35.374
at the Riverside Speedway
in Antigonish.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.126
It's got the upgraded suspension

14:37.209 --> 14:40.170
and Richard Petty's cousin
signed the dash.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.881
I forgot to mention that.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.507
-[whimpering]
-All right! All right!

14:43.591 --> 14:44.717
Stop your crying, will you?

14:44.800 --> 14:48.888
You're gonna fog up those candy dishes
in your fucking head. Jesus!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.765
You're telling me that
that was a real pace car?

14:51.849 --> 14:55.102
That was a pace car at Riverside,
I promise you.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.771
-Please.
-All right.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.442
You're lucky I'm in a good fucking mood.
And it better be a fucking pace car.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.819
It is. The paperwork's
in the glove compartment.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.404
10 Gs it is.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.530
Shamu,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.908
get everything logged in and tagged.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.536
All right? Or I'll tape your blow
hole shut, so help me.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.416
Okay. Ricky, can you go
finalize everything?

15:17.499 --> 15:19.835
I need to say goodbye to Guy Fierio

15:20.461 --> 15:21.962
and my LGBT.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.255
Your what?

15:23.464 --> 15:25.549
My Little Green Bastard Truck.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.053
Sorry, buddy. Julian better
fucking appreciate this.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.262
[whimpering]

15:32.389 --> 15:34.975
I guess this is it, little buddy.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.268
[whimpers]

15:37.269 --> 15:39.271
I know it sucks, buddy,
but they're just cars.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.731
It's a good thing we're doing here.

15:40.814 --> 15:44.485
I know, Ricky, but my dream car!
My dream car, gone.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.987
My perfect little truck gone.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.073
Fucking Julian better appreciate this.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.532
He will, buddy. I mean...

15:50.616 --> 15:53.619
We'll get your cars back. If we don't,
we'll get you something just as nice.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.537
No, Ricky, it's just like...

15:55.621 --> 15:57.790
-What the... Jesus!
-Are you fucked in the head?

15:57.873 --> 16:00.376
Watch where you're going,
you blind bastard!

16:00.459 --> 16:01.543
Fuck!

16:02.294 --> 16:03.629
Fuck, Ricky, he's got a mask.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.005
-Give me your fucking money...
-Ahhh!

16:05.089 --> 16:07.758
-Not a fucking chance!
-I'll blow your fucking heads off!

16:07.841 --> 16:08.842
-[gunshot]
-Fuck! Jesus Christ!

16:08.926 --> 16:10.761
-You think I'm fucking around?
-No, Bubbles, no!

16:10.844 --> 16:12.137
-Money! Now-w-w!
-Ricky!

16:12.221 --> 16:13.722
-Here, here!
-Fuck!

16:13.806 --> 16:15.975
-Money!
-Fuck!

16:16.058 --> 16:17.601
Are you shot, Ricky?

16:17.685 --> 16:18.811
Oh, my fuck!

16:22.398 --> 16:25.192
-Candy?
-[laughing] Wow. Hey.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.568
Julian.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.611
Nice suit.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.822
Thank you.
You look fantastic.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.116
-Thank you.
-What are you doing here?

16:32.199 --> 16:34.284
Uh, I'm the Crown prosecutor.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.453
Hmm... Wow, good for you!

16:36.537 --> 16:38.247
-[chuckling] Thanks, thanks.
-Good going.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.874
See things haven't changed
much for you, huh?

16:40.958 --> 16:43.460
It's not what it sounds like.
I'm taking the fall for some kids.

16:43.544 --> 16:47.047
You get a record when you're a kid,
your life's ruined, you know? I know that.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.299
Got it. So you're just... innocent

16:49.383 --> 16:50.926
and you're covering for the kids

16:51.010 --> 16:53.929
who have all signed written statements
to the contrary.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.764
-Yeah, I told them to do it.
-Oh.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.933
They're a great bunch of kids.
They just need some guidance.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.101
Okay.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.520
Look... not that I need it, but...

17:01.603 --> 17:04.897
do you think you could go a little
easier on me now that you know the deal?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.608
-You know, five to seven is fucked.
-Seriously?

17:07.693 --> 17:10.570
[scoffing] Wow.
You know what, Julian,

17:10.654 --> 17:15.659
you should have made some choices
and grown up, like I did.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.537
You know, I worked my ass off
to get where I am today,

17:18.619 --> 17:21.248
so I take my job really seriously.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.708
-Okay.
-Good luck in there.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.167
-Thank you.
-You'll need it.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.260
There goes the dragon queen,
but don't worry about it.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.346
Are you ready to do this, big boy?
Hmm? Everything in place with Gary?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.515
I hope so. I haven't heard
anything different, man.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.767
Got it. You got my money?

17:39.850 --> 17:42.728
I'm assuming so, man, but I don't know
where the fuck those guys are.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.605
All right. Well, look,
I'll wait for them.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.566
You should head on in.
It's better for me to be late than you.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.860
-All right.
-Oh, uh, ba-ba-ba-ba!

17:49.943 --> 17:51.904
You look great.
Piece of cake!

17:51.987 --> 17:53.447
-Gonna win!
-All right.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.990
All right, get in there.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.704
You fellas need an attorney?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.664
[engine roaring]

18:04.291 --> 18:05.918
[brakes screeching]

18:06.251 --> 18:07.711
-Ahh, fuck...
-Ricky...

18:08.420 --> 18:11.715
Ricky, you're gonna get
a parking ticket, parking like that.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.467
Ah, fuck!

18:13.759 --> 18:15.928
Just wait, just wait, Ricky, just wait.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.680
-Come on, Bubs, we've gotta go!
-Don't think I can do it.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.849
-What?
-Julian's fucked, Ricky!

18:20.933 --> 18:23.852
I can't go in there
and just watch him go to jail forever.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.229
-Fuck...
-I just can't do it.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.064
I'm too nervous.
Fucking wait here then.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.525
We've got to get in there.
Goddamn it!

18:29.858 --> 18:31.235
[whimpering]

18:31.318 --> 18:32.569
Just go.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.282
[clattering]

18:37.366 --> 18:38.575
Ah, fuck!

18:38.659 --> 18:42.162
Jesus Hubert Christ! What the hell
happened to you, buddy?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.789
We had the fucking 10 grand

18:43.872 --> 18:47.251
and this cock-sucking crack whore's
bastard child fucking robbed us

18:47.334 --> 18:49.837
at gunpoint, took the money,
and made me shoot myself in the leg.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.089
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...
You don't have my money?

18:52.172 --> 18:55.592
No. We're fucking good for it. Gonna
take us more time to come up with it.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.594
Yeah, but you did pay Gary though, right?

18:57.678 --> 18:59.930
Couldn't. But we'll fucking pay him.
It's all good.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.432
Yeah, great.
Well, that's the end of it.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.519
People who commit perjury
don't take IOUs.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.021
And given the updated situation,
neither do I.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.607
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Look, Julian is fucked,

19:10.691 --> 19:12.818
which means I don't get paid,

19:12.901 --> 19:15.445
which means I'm the hell outta here.
Look, if you...

19:15.529 --> 19:16.655
-What?
-If you need something

19:16.738 --> 19:19.783
in the next five to seven years,
give me a jangle.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.703
Fuck that! Where the fuck do I even go?

19:22.786 --> 19:25.164
In the courtroom, ass-hat!

19:25.497 --> 19:27.040
Ah, fuck.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.917
Hey, what the fuck's up?

19:33.338 --> 19:35.674
[whispering]
Thank fuck. What the hell happened?

19:35.757 --> 19:37.467
[whispering]
I got fucking shot.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.012
Some dick-less, shit-blooded cock
bandit fucking robbed us,

19:40.095 --> 19:42.014
took all the money.
You're fucked, man, I'm sorry.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.600
Oh, Jesus Christ! Where the hell's
Steinberg? He's got to get...

19:44.683 --> 19:46.476
...get them to fucking delay this trial.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.478
Yeah, about that.
Don't think it's gonna happen.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.148
He just fucking quit because
we didn't have his fucking money.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.192
-Is that Candy over there?
-Yes.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.651
-She smart?
-Very.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.069
-We're fucked.
-All rise.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.240
The Honourable Judge Ticklebury presiding.
[Ricky giggling]

20:00.991 --> 20:02.492
Be seated.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.371
Will the defendant and his counsel
please rise?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.582
Uh, Your Honour, sir, uh...

20:08.665 --> 20:11.001
my lawyer just quit on me
for some unknown reason.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.669
[Ticklebury] So you have
no representation?

20:12.753 --> 20:15.214
-Well, I did, but now he's--
-But now you don't.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.633
So you have no representation,
correct?

20:17.716 --> 20:21.345
[Julian] Uh, correct, but can I motion
that thingy forth

20:21.428 --> 20:24.014
to maybe delay this until
I get another lawyer, please?

20:24.097 --> 20:26.308
Your Honour, this is a ploy
to delay the trial

20:26.391 --> 20:28.268
because it's an open and shut case.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.854
You know, the evidence against
the defendant is overwhelming

20:30.938 --> 20:32.898
and it's a complete waste
of the court's time.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.566
-[Ticklebury] Duly noted, counsel.
-Thank you.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.444
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Waste of time? Hmmph!

20:37.945 --> 20:41.240
That lying sack of fucking human
dog shit right there

20:41.323 --> 20:45.035
is the only evidence they have, and
he is fucked! Look at him, he can't...

20:45.118 --> 20:48.163
Order! You watch your mouth
in my courtroom, sir.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.166
-[Ricky] Yeah, okay. What the fuck ever.
-Excuse me?

20:51.917 --> 20:55.587
And who exactly are you? And what
are you doing in this courtroom?

20:55.671 --> 20:58.674
And why are you seated
next to the defendant?

20:58.757 --> 21:00.801
Actually, as of right now,

21:00.884 --> 21:02.719
I'm representing
my friend Julian here, okay?

21:02.803 --> 21:05.430
My name is Ricky LaFleur and I've been
around courtrooms enough to know

21:05.514 --> 21:07.599
-what the fuck is what.
-Better watch your language, son.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.309
I won't tolerate it.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.478
And what is that stuck to your leg?

21:11.561 --> 21:12.771
Are you bleeding?

21:12.854 --> 21:16.358
Actually I am. Pretty fucking badly.
I'm in a lot of pain.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.443
I got shot less than 10 minutes ago

21:18.527 --> 21:20.821
by someone that that fucking
asshole hired right there

21:20.904 --> 21:23.824
'cause he knew I was gonna talk
at the trial and fuck everything up.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.867
I'm sorry, what...
what are you insinuating?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.494
[Ricky] Oh, my God, please.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.830
Fuck off with the big
fancy judgey type words.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.415
I don't understand them.
Nobody does.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.582
So you can stop showing off

21:32.666 --> 21:35.627
with your mastering of the Eng-a-lish
language. Nobody's impressed.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.005
Final warning.
I'll find you in contempt.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.048
You do know what
the word contempt means?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.634
Yeah, I certainly do. I've been fined
for fucking contempt many times,

21:42.718 --> 21:44.636
I'm not afraid to get fined for it again.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.264
I'm just trying to save a fucking
completely innocent man here

21:47.347 --> 21:49.850
from going to jail.
He was fucking framed!

21:49.933 --> 21:53.020
Objection, Your Honour...
This is insane.

21:53.103 --> 21:56.732
You can't let this mockery
of our justice system continue, sir.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.277
It's not a fucking mocklery,
so fuck off with that shit...

22:00.360 --> 22:02.070
You know what? I'm sorry.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.949
Listen, it's really, really fucking hard
for me to talk without swearing.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.243
That's the way most
normal people talk. They swear.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.663
I'm sure you swear when you're not wearing
that weird little robe, but anyway...

22:11.747 --> 22:13.040
My friend Julian here

22:13.123 --> 22:15.584
was working at the mall
doing security, okay,

22:15.667 --> 22:18.295
when dick flapper over here decides
to go on some trip

22:18.378 --> 22:20.714
to get fucking learnt
on something, supposedly,

22:20.797 --> 22:23.467
and while he's gone,
Julian has this great idea.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.553
He sets up this undercover
sting operation to catch shoplifters.

22:26.636 --> 22:29.181
And when sour-cream-glazed
dick nuts here returned,

22:29.264 --> 22:32.768
he was so fucking jealous 'cause
Julian kicked ass and did such a good job,

22:32.851 --> 22:34.311
he was actually really scared.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.772
He was afraid that he was gonna lose
his fucking job

22:36.855 --> 22:38.607
and get replaced by Julian.

22:38.690 --> 22:42.694
So, in his mind, his only option is
to fucking frame Julian for shoplifting.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.696
The only way he could save his career,
his living-hood.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.532
So that's what he fucking did.
You are a terrible person, Gary.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.825
Shame on you, sir!

22:48.909 --> 22:50.952
Bullshit! Bull-fucking-shit!

22:51.036 --> 22:52.454
-[Ricky] Oh, yeah?
-You fucking liar!

22:52.537 --> 22:54.915
-Really?
-I've got it on tape, for fuck's sake!

22:54.998 --> 22:57.250
-Okay.
-What is wrong with you people?

22:57.334 --> 23:01.463
Are you all atheists? This is a
provincial fucking courtroom, for f...!

23:01.546 --> 23:04.174
See? It's not that easy, is it?

23:04.257 --> 23:05.884
Our apologies, your lordship, on our end.

23:05.967 --> 23:10.222
The only reason you have Julian on tape,
pretending to fucking steal,

23:10.305 --> 23:14.142
is 'cause he was deep, deep undercover.
You stupidy-stupid, dumb dummy!

23:14.226 --> 23:15.894
If you'd just bothered
to fucking ask him

23:15.977 --> 23:18.105
before you called the cops,
you would have known that!

23:18.188 --> 23:19.564
But you know what, Gary?

23:19.648 --> 23:22.025
Right now I wanna talk
about another fact.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.445
I wanna talk about the fact
that you tried to blackmail us

23:25.529 --> 23:27.656
into paying you five fucking
thousand dollars,

23:27.739 --> 23:30.617
and... this is a nice one...
he tried to make us

23:30.700 --> 23:33.995
have a naked, candlelit, lemony-scented
bubble bath with him

23:34.079 --> 23:37.082
just so he would come clean
and tell the fucking truth in court!

23:37.165 --> 23:40.043
That is fucked. What do you think
about that there, Caesar-salad cock?

23:40.127 --> 23:44.256
You want to fucking talk about those--
-[Ticklebury] Order! Enough! Enough!

23:44.339 --> 23:48.426
What in the name of Jesus Christ's
earlobes is going on here?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.303
-Good question.
-Counsel, approach the bench now, please.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.972
-Sure.
-Not you!

23:52.055 --> 23:55.684
-You and your potty mouth can stay put.
-Fine. I'm just trying to figure out

23:55.767 --> 23:57.936
how something like this could happen
in such a perfect country.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.689
Where the fuck are we right now,
the West Koreas? This is fucked!

24:00.772 --> 24:02.482
[Ticklebury] Stop talking!
Now I'm serious.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.442
-All right. No problem.
-Sit down!

24:04.526 --> 24:06.236
-Right now?
-Yes!

24:06.319 --> 24:07.737
Okay, I'm sitting, fuck.

24:07.821 --> 24:12.242
Now, counsellor, can you please
shed some light on all of this?

24:12.325 --> 24:15.996
Are any of the accusations true
against your only witness?

24:16.079 --> 24:18.582
You know, blackmail,
naked bubble baths?

24:18.665 --> 24:21.710
What in the name of Moses' baby girl
is going on here?

24:21.793 --> 24:24.838
My apologies, Your Honour.
I received this case only yesterday

24:24.921 --> 24:27.966
after the other Crown counsel
was arrested, as I'm sure you've heard.

24:28.049 --> 24:31.094
Yeah, I heard.
It was a shame. Yeah.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.973
I had a coke problem in my 50s.
It's a tough thing to shake.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.683
Oh, yeah. Indeed.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.269
Speaking of cocaine... You guys were just
talking about cocaine there, I think.

24:39.352 --> 24:42.731
Well, Gary here has a massive fucking
cocaine problem.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.275
Maybe you should talk about how
you were stealing from the mall

24:45.358 --> 24:47.903
to support your fucking habit, Gary.
Let's talk about that right now.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.529
More fucking lies!

24:49.613 --> 24:51.239
I-I was at an ashram.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.034
-Hmm... a coke ashram.
-I'll fucking kill you!

24:54.117 --> 24:56.828
Okay, seriously?
Death threats?

24:56.912 --> 24:59.164
Seven days contempt of court!

24:59.247 --> 25:00.415
[gavel banging]

25:00.498 --> 25:02.792
-Fuck you, Gary.
-Anyone else want some?

25:02.876 --> 25:04.169
[Ricky] I'm good.

25:07.505 --> 25:09.883
So... continue.

25:10.383 --> 25:14.346
Right. So, Your Honour, I had literally
five hours to prepare for this case,

25:14.429 --> 25:18.892
so this is the first that I'm hearing
about naked bubble baths and...

25:18.975 --> 25:21.353
-and blackmail.
-[Ricky] And cocaine.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.313
There's the cocaine as well.

25:23.396 --> 25:27.734
But your entire case revolves
around the testimony

25:27.817 --> 25:30.528
of this witness, does it not?

25:30.612 --> 25:31.905
[Candy] Yes, Your Honour.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.115
So what do you have to say?

25:34.783 --> 25:37.160
I guess I'm fucked
on this one too, sir.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.411
Yeah, I think you are.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.789
I'm gonna walk over to my gavel
and make a decision.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.165
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.250
Thank you.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.463
Clearly the Crown is not prepared
to proceed, so I have no other option

25:48.546 --> 25:50.674
but to declare the case dismissed.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.133
[gavel banging]

25:52.217 --> 25:53.802
[laughing]

25:53.885 --> 25:56.096
You are a good fucking man there,
Judge Ticklebury!

25:57.430 --> 25:59.516
[Ricky] Yeah-h-h-h!
Fuck you, court!

25:59.599 --> 26:00.850
[Bubbles] What happened?
What happened?

26:00.934 --> 26:02.018
Why did Steinberg leave?

26:02.102 --> 26:03.895
-He took off, man. He defended me.
-Ah! Fuck...

26:03.979 --> 26:07.232
-He was amazing. He put on a clin...
He's the smartest man I know right there.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.984
I've been saying that
my whole fucking life.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.069
Rick, I'll never forget this, buddy,
thank you.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.363
That was way too close, man.
I love you, buddy.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.323
Love you too.
That was way too close.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.451
There's no fucking way I was letting you
go away for that long. Fuck that!

26:18.535 --> 26:19.744
Here, get over here, man.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.329
Thank you, Bubs.
I love you too, buddy.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.664
I love you too, Julian.

26:23.957 --> 26:27.419
But now I hope you understand
what the fuck I've been saying.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.130
[voice breaking] I thought
you were gonna do hard time, Julian!

26:30.213 --> 26:32.215
And I thought I was fucked
for good that time,

26:32.299 --> 26:35.427
and I've never felt that way before
in my life. That was scary.

26:35.510 --> 26:39.597
Yeah, well, the crime and the bullshit,
boys, it's fucking done!

26:39.681 --> 26:41.474
That's it! Final word.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.976
That goes for you too, Ricky.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.561
I'm never breaking the law again.
I'm good.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.229
[Candy] Hey, Julian.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.356
-Guys.
-[Ricky] Hi.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.441
Wow...

26:49.858 --> 26:52.027
it is really freaky seeing you again.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.695
-[Julian] Big time.
-Yeah.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.156
I'm really sorry that asshole tried
to blackmail you.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.907
-It's all right.
-Son of a bitch.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.367
Drug addicts, you know?

26:59.451 --> 27:00.535
-The worst.
-They're the worst.

27:00.618 --> 27:03.288
-Yep.
-Yeah. Hey, here's my card.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.498
You know, just in case.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.375
-Okay.
-Yeah. Good to see you.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.252
-Yeah, good to see you too.
-Bye.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.129
-Good game. That was fun.
-Ricky...

27:12.505 --> 27:15.467
-Bubs, stop staring at her ass.
-I wasn't... staring.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.970
-You were staring right at her.
-I looked at it and it's nice.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.847
-It is nice.
-Very nice.

27:23.558 --> 27:26.561
How can you sit there
so composed and calm, Mr. Lahey?

27:26.644 --> 27:28.188
We're seriously frigged.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.357
'Cause I'm not worried about it, Randy.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.276
Well, you should be. They raised
the money, he's getting out.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.112
Our lives are gonna be
a complete living hell, I'm telling you.

27:36.196 --> 27:39.908
Yeah, well, either way,
it is what it is.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.743
There's nothing we can do about it.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.162
Randy, it's all predetermined.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.373
♪ Que sera, sera, sera ♪

27:46.456 --> 27:49.626
Look, when it happens, we'll deal with it.
We always do.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.086
But how, sir?

27:51.169 --> 27:54.339
Julian's gonna run all over us.
We're frigged!

27:54.422 --> 27:57.008
[George] No need to get
your panties in a bunch, Randy.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.927
Julian isn't going anywhere.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.136
Not without this.

28:04.224 --> 28:08.144
Holy sweet shit bags, Randers!

28:08.228 --> 28:10.188
Nice work, George.

28:10.688 --> 28:14.275
See Randy? Fickle finger
of fate's on our side, bud.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.735
George...

28:16.694 --> 28:18.863
I've got a sneaking suspicion.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.699
Why would you not take off
with the money?

28:21.783 --> 28:24.536
Randy and I wouldn't
have been any of the wiser.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.788
Well, I thought about it, Jim.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.374
But where would that leave me
once it was gone?

28:29.457 --> 28:33.586
Dirty ex-cop that no one would hire,
no friends, no place to live,

28:34.254 --> 28:35.672
getting arrested the way I did

28:35.755 --> 28:37.882
and leaving the department
in utter disgrace...

28:37.966 --> 28:40.343
Well, I've now walked
in your shoes, Jim.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.596
And I can honestly say I'm amazed
you're still standing

28:43.680 --> 28:46.307
and that you've managed
to keep it together as much as you have.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.851
Yeah, well.

28:48.351 --> 28:51.563
It... it was tough, George.
I have to admit it.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.316
Ah, you always said
I was the stupidest cop on the force.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.818
The dumbest.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.779
Well, you know what?

29:00.447 --> 29:01.781
You were right, Jim.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.577
I wish I could argue with you, George,

29:06.161 --> 29:07.370
but I can't.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.166
Uh-huh.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.505
[Marguerite] For God's sake,
get the fuck off my property...

29:17.589 --> 29:19.507
-I'm so sorry...
-Piss off, pervert!

29:19.591 --> 29:21.092
-[wheezing]
-Ricky, for God's sake,

29:21.176 --> 29:24.262
will you get these hopped-up fuckheads
the hell out of here?

29:24.345 --> 29:27.098
Not only do I find them
sleeping under my trailer,

29:27.182 --> 29:31.186
but now they're behaving like they're
from some other fucking planet!

29:31.603 --> 29:35.315
I'm going down to your trailer
to have one Olympian shit.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.399
-You know why?
-Why?

29:36.483 --> 29:39.778
I still do not have
a fucking bathroom!

29:39.861 --> 29:41.196
-What?
-No.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.323
What the fuck is wrong
with you ass-roosters?

29:43.406 --> 29:45.700
Why the fuck do you not have
the bathroom done yet?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.577
[indistinct singing]

29:48.620 --> 29:50.914
How fucking high are you?
Where did you get the weed, boys?

29:50.997 --> 29:52.624
It's not weed, dudio!

29:53.333 --> 29:55.752
Follow this through here.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.670
Ugh!
What the fuck?

29:57.754 --> 30:00.006
Marguerite is growing
mushrooms, dude!

30:00.089 --> 30:02.550
-It's so fucking rad!
-[Cory roaring]

30:02.634 --> 30:04.594
It's not fucking Marguerite,
you cock-dusters,

30:04.677 --> 30:06.137
it's the fucking cow manure.

30:07.263 --> 30:08.431
[Jacob] What?

30:08.515 --> 30:09.641
Oh, my fuck.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.726
[Cory] ♪ Follow Ricky to the trailer ♪

30:11.810 --> 30:14.103
[scatting]

30:14.187 --> 30:16.648
♪ Follow Ricky to the trailer ♪

30:16.856 --> 30:18.233
♪ Follow Ricky to the... ♪

30:18.316 --> 30:19.526
[clattering]

30:19.609 --> 30:21.277
[Ricky] Oh-h-h-h...

30:21.361 --> 30:24.656
My fucking sweet glorious
blizzard nipples!

30:25.990 --> 30:28.952
Not a fucking word of this to anybody.
Not even Trin, Jacob, you got it?

30:29.035 --> 30:30.078
Yeah.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.622
Sometimes you are pretty fucking awesome.

30:32.705 --> 30:35.542
Like Ron Cruise said,
"Flow me the money!

30:35.625 --> 30:38.962
Flow me the money!"
Yes!

30:39.337 --> 30:41.339
-Oh, my God.
-[dog barking]

30:41.881 --> 30:44.050
[theme music]

31:25.717 --> 31:28.136
[seagulls squawking]

31:39.606 --> 31:43.359
[fish] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

31:44.944 --> 31:47.697
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

31:50.658 --> 31:51.910
[whisper] Fuck.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.329
-[light clicks off]
- Fuck off.
