01:02.840 --> 01:04.364
<i>Did she?</i>

01:06.080 --> 01:07.809
<i>Didn't she?</i>

01:09.080 --> 01:10.730
<i>Who's to blame?</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:15.490
<i>I was an orphan.</i>

01:16.520 --> 01:18.522
<i>Ambrose took me in.</i>

01:21.360 --> 01:23.169
<i>He was my cousin...</i>

01:24.280 --> 01:25.680
<i>but I loved him like a father.</i>

01:25.760 --> 01:28.525
Yes! Another!

01:31.840 --> 01:33.729
<i>They said,
"the boy needs a mother..."</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:40.360
<i>but the only women allowed
in the house were the dogs.</i>

01:40.440 --> 01:42.283
Good girl. Good girl.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.200
<i>I came back from school.</i>

01:56.280 --> 01:57.770
Here, give me that.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.044
<i>What had I learned?</i>

02:08.199 --> 02:10.202
<i>I didn't like books.</i>

02:11.360 --> 02:12.964
<i>I didn't like cities.</i>

02:14.680 --> 02:16.284
<i>I didn't like clever talk.</i>

02:19.080 --> 02:20.286
<i>I liked it...</i>

02:21.760 --> 02:22.760
<i>here.</i>

02:29.240 --> 02:30.401
<i>But Ambrose fell ill.</i>

02:35.080 --> 02:36.560
<i>The doctors sent him off...</i>

02:36.640 --> 02:38.200
Go.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.850
For the sunshine.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.291
<i>How I missed him.</i>

03:00.720 --> 03:01.880
<i>Every letter I shared</i>

03:01.960 --> 03:03.560
<i>with my godfather and his daughter.</i>

03:03.640 --> 03:06.200
I've got a letter from Ambrose.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
Just arrived.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.640
<i>Then, that summer, his letters mentioned...</i>

03:09.720 --> 03:11.240
Boots!

03:11.320 --> 03:14.880
"My cousin,
and so your cousin too,

03:14.960 --> 03:17.600
Rachel, a widow, very good company,

03:17.680 --> 03:19.840
who has kindly taken it upon herself

03:19.920 --> 03:23.240
to show me all the glories of Florence.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.760
She lives out here in the sunshine,

03:24.840 --> 03:27.200
but is as English as you or I..."

03:27.280 --> 03:29.120
She must be extremely charming

03:29.200 --> 03:30.560
for Ambrose
to have noticed her.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.640
What do you mean?

03:31.720 --> 03:33.240
Oh, I've never heard of him

03:33.320 --> 03:35.120
admiring a woman before.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.488
Oh, she's right. Your cousin
never had much need for women.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.164
Why should he?

03:41.280 --> 03:42.770
He had me.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.206
How old is she?

03:46.320 --> 03:47.810
Doesn't say.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.290
<i>And by the autumn...</i>

03:51.360 --> 03:53.520
<i>"Such wonderful news.</i>

03:53.600 --> 03:55.443
<i>Rachel and I are to marry!</i>

03:56.120 --> 03:58.040
<i>She's agreed.</i>

03:58.120 --> 04:01.488
<i>Such happiness to be so blessed.</i>

04:02.320 --> 04:04.120
<i>I'm certain the moment
you set eyes on her,</i>

04:04.200 --> 04:05.247
<i>you'll understand.</i>

04:06.440 --> 04:09.489
<i>She is radiant, she is good,</i>

04:09.600 --> 04:11.728
<i>and she is the kindest companion."</i>

04:13.600 --> 04:16.922
She'll have everything
turned upside down in no time.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.883
Shan't know where we bloody are
from one minute to the next.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.120
Have you thought about the future?

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
Hmm?

04:30.480 --> 04:33.165
Well, a home of your own?

04:34.280 --> 04:36.760
Why on Earth should I do that?

04:36.880 --> 04:38.640
Well,

04:38.720 --> 04:41.087
The position's changed
somewhat, hasn't it?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.200
When are you expecting them?

04:50.280 --> 04:51.960
No doubt in his great happiness,

04:52.040 --> 04:53.520
he'll have forgotten all about us.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.683
Poor Philip. Are you being
orphaned all over again?

04:57.560 --> 04:58.840
Preposterous comment.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.320
It's good that he's happy, isn't it?

05:01.400 --> 05:04.240
Well, that's the whole point, surely.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.722
- Point of what?
- Getting married.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.248
I'm sure there'll be a letter soon.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.960
<i>"I have written to you several times,</i>

05:24.520 --> 05:26.966
<i>but she watches me like a hawk</i>

05:28.000 --> 05:29.280
<i>and there is no one I can trust</i>

05:29.360 --> 05:31.249
<i>to take my letters to the mail.</i>

05:32.160 --> 05:34.320
<i>She is away from the house today.</i>

05:34.400 --> 05:36.050
<i>That's why I am able to write this.</i>

05:39.520 --> 05:41.360
<i>For weeks, I have been ill:</i>

05:41.440 --> 05:44.205
<i>fevers, terrible headaches.</i>

05:44.320 --> 05:46.800
<i>I am sick of the sight of the sun.</i>

05:46.880 --> 05:48.160
As for the doctors,

05:48.240 --> 05:49.680
I don't trust any of them.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.970
The new one, recommended
by that snake Rainaldi,

05:54.080 --> 05:56.048
is a cut-throat, I am sure."

06:07.040 --> 06:08.565
Who's Rainaldi?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.360
No clue.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.851
May I see?

06:18.720 --> 06:21.120
Was he drunk, do you think?

06:21.200 --> 06:23.521
- Drunk?
- When he wrote the letter.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.521
Never.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.765
Look.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.880
"She has done for me at last.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.610
Rachel, my torment.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.128
For god's sake, come quickly."

07:47.200 --> 07:48.804
Hello?

07:59.280 --> 08:00.770
Good boy.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.289
You must be Philip.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.403
I've been expecting you.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.880
How do you know who I am?

08:25.960 --> 08:27.480
I am sure I'm not the first to notice

08:27.560 --> 08:30.280
the remarkable resemblance to your cousin.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.284
Please, come in. I'm nearly finished.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.280
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

08:39.360 --> 08:41.760
Surely, my dear fellow, you know...

08:46.000 --> 08:47.570
he's dead.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.122
Where's the woman?

09:01.920 --> 09:03.680
- The woman?
- She...

09:03.760 --> 09:05.760
The Rachel woman.
Where is she?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.560
- Gone.
- Where?

09:07.640 --> 09:09.927
I have no clue. It's the truth.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.725
How did he die?

09:25.160 --> 09:28.880
It was a tumor, in the head. Here.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.691
The doctors are in no doubt.
It affected his brain.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.168
- How?
- Oh.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.804
Shouting.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.640
Violence. Terrible distrust.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.640
The doctors are all idiots,
and I of course,

09:44.720 --> 09:46.320
the worst idiot of all.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.880
Things are thrown, glasses smashed.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.169
His wife pushed up against the wall

09:53.280 --> 09:54.645
and held by the throat.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.524
She wants this place let. Even sold.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.970
Your cousin Rachel, Mr. Ashley,

10:04.080 --> 10:07.402
is a woman of very strong... impulse

10:08.080 --> 10:10.287
and passion.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.803
Very strong.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.769
Do you understand?

10:29.640 --> 10:31.768
Where are his things?

10:32.240 --> 10:33.480
Hmm?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.722
His clothes, his books...

10:36.520 --> 10:39.400
The day after the funeral,
she was gone.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.970
Unbelievable bitch.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.600
Hmm?

10:43.680 --> 10:46.684
I said how much I was looking
forward to seeing her.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.720
My name is Rainaldi.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.560
I am your cousin's lawyer and advisor,

10:53.640 --> 10:55.520
and I hope friend.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.681
<i>Prego.</i>

10:59.560 --> 11:02.530
A copy of the certificate of death.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.483
A copy has already been
sent to you in England

11:04.600 --> 11:06.400
and another one to the trustee
of Ambrose's will,

11:06.480 --> 11:09.848
your godfather, <i>Signor</i> Kendall.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.128
- You know all about me.
- Of course.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.880
There are some remarkable
things to see here.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.360
Really?

11:23.440 --> 11:26.520
Churches, paintings and so on.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.320
- But, then again...
- What?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.480
Oh, you strike me as someone
perhaps more interested

11:31.560 --> 11:34.166
in beer and foxes
than the <i>Rinascimento.</i>

11:35.880 --> 11:36.920
And why not?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.400
I believe nothing
of what you've told me.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.560
I believe had I been here,

11:40.640 --> 11:42.244
my cousin would still be alive.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.840
And I believe that whatever it cost him

11:45.920 --> 11:48.446
in pain and suffering before he died,

11:48.560 --> 11:52.326
I will return in full measure

11:52.440 --> 11:55.410
upon the woman that caused it.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.685
He was a good man, Master Philip.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.560
- May he rest in peace.
- Thank you, guy.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.080
- God rest his soul.
- Right.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.080
Come on, Jericho,
give me that damn thing.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.810
You always did scythe like a girl.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.247
More beef, Master Philip?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.370
Master Philip?

12:37.880 --> 12:39.800
You're the master now,
Master Philip.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.484
You're the master.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.130
<i>It's the same will I drew up 10 years ago.</i>

12:55.360 --> 12:57.600
No provision has been made for a wife.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.684
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.360
I've examined it carefully

13:03.440 --> 13:07.200
and the accompanying letter
from <i>Signor</i> Rainaldi.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.640
There's no mention anywhere of any claim

13:09.720 --> 13:11.449
on the part of Mrs. Ashley.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.130
I'm amazed.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.760
Why?

13:15.840 --> 13:18.640
We know perfectly well
she drove him to his death.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.320
We know nothing of the sort.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.920
If that's the way you're going to talk

13:23.000 --> 13:24.640
about your cousin's widow,

13:24.720 --> 13:27.246
then frankly, I don't want to listen.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.440
You have been extremely fortunate.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.280
The entire estate will fall
to you on your next birthday,

13:33.360 --> 13:34.930
as per Ambrose's wishes.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.360
Surely you don't believe all
this nonsense about the tumor?

13:38.800 --> 13:40.768
Here is the death certificate

13:41.640 --> 13:43.449
with an account of the post mortem.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.880
And what possible motive could she have?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.689
With nothing to gain from his death?

13:49.680 --> 13:53.127
So, yes, why wouldn't I believe?

13:54.680 --> 13:57.126
Ambrose wasn't my father...

13:59.240 --> 14:01.242
but he was like a father.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.283
In fact, better than most fathers.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.529
We all miss him.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.130
I miss him.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.560
But you should know
that the new Master Ashley

14:18.640 --> 14:21.291
plans to carry on
much the same as the old.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.040
She's in England.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.130
She's here.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.000
<i>I wouldn't worry.</i>

14:50.080 --> 14:51.400
She'll take one look at the place

14:51.480 --> 14:53.080
and get straight back into her carriage.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.446
Good.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.887
Look at it. The dust.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.889
She can dust it herself if it bothers her.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.560
And the smell.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.320
Has every dog in the county
taken a shit in here?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.440
Possibly.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.760
Where are you going to put her?

15:06.840 --> 15:09.161
- Ambrose's room?
- No.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.322
I shall take Ambrose's room.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.130
She can have the blue room.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.840
Really?

15:17.920 --> 15:19.968
Is it watertight?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.002
Should suit her perfectly.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.488
What are you going to do with her?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.690
Confront her.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.280
Of course, she'll try
and bluster her way out of it

15:46.360 --> 15:49.520
- or faint...
- Mmm. Swoon, theatrically.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.880
Have hysterics... isn't that
what one expects of Italians?

15:52.960 --> 15:55.406
Well, she's only half Italian.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.320
<i>All that macaroni.
She'll probably be too fat</i>

16:00.400 --> 16:02.971
<i>to get up the stairs.</i>

16:05.280 --> 16:08.602
<i>I want justice for Ambrose.</i>

16:09.440 --> 16:11.408
I think you're nervous.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.600
Not at all.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.560
- Would you like me to stay?
- What do you mean?

16:17.640 --> 16:19.600
I mean, to be here?

16:19.680 --> 16:21.728
What time are you expecting her?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.489
I think I can manage.

16:30.520 --> 16:31.920
You really are nervous, aren't you?

16:32.400 --> 16:34.482
I just want to be on my own for...

16:50.920 --> 16:53.526
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. Not at all.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.571
- I quite understand.
- No, I am sorry.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.565
And thank you...

17:02.600 --> 17:04.045
for everything...

17:05.839 --> 17:08.730
for the flowers and offering to stay.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.648
Of course.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.165
Good luck.

17:14.319 --> 17:17.085
And try not to throttle her
before dinner.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.599
Make sure she waits for her dinner.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.520
Make sure she holds her hunger

17:27.599 --> 17:29.440
until the master of the house is back.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.880
- Clear?
- Clear as day.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.088
Good. Make sure of it.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.720
- She's here.
- Well? No luggage?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.929
Master Ambrose's things have
all been put in your old room.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.840
Oh.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.081
Oh.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.520
- Where is she now?
- In her room.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.126
In her room. In her room.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.091
Says she's tired and would you
excuse her for dinner.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.569
Where the devil are the dogs?

19:05.760 --> 19:08.206
I think they followed her upstairs.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.528
What was she like, for god's sake?

19:16.840 --> 19:18.490
Couldn't say, sir.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.360
Good god, man. Is she fat, thin?

19:23.440 --> 19:26.967
Tall, short? Does she have a wooden leg?

19:28.720 --> 19:30.040
A mustache?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.009
Has she got a wart on her nose?

19:33.120 --> 19:35.282
I don't know anything about that, sir.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.720
The madam has sent word

19:51.800 --> 19:55.160
that should you wish
to pay your compliments,

19:55.240 --> 19:57.720
when you have dined,

19:57.840 --> 20:01.640
she would be pleased to receive you, sir.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.129
Thank you, Seecombe.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.767
That's it, Seecombe, thank you.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.891
Come in.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.571
Ambrose...

21:20.360 --> 21:23.320
I am very sorry.

21:23.400 --> 21:27.041
I didn't expect you to be
quite so like your cousin.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.002
Won't you sit down for a moment?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.364
Would you like some tea?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.284
Very well, if you wish.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.520
Is this a smart thing to do?

21:57.600 --> 21:59.680
Where you come from?

21:59.760 --> 22:01.320
It's just a cup of tea.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.289
I'm surprised they knew how to do this.

22:06.600 --> 22:11.320
Oh, the... the butter's, erm, melting.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.961
You've got... You'd better
lick your fingers.

22:31.320 --> 22:32.560
Smoke if you'd like.

22:33.640 --> 22:34.960
Seecombe will think it very wrong.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.160
He'll smell it in the morning.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.600
Well, then, I'll open the window

22:37.680 --> 22:38.960
before I go to bed.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.360
The rain will come in
and spoil the new carpet.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.480
How pernickety you are.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.520
I thought you lot worried
about things like that.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.720
- You lot?
- Women.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.485
Only when they have
nothing else to worry about.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.320
Nobody seems to have been in here

22:57.400 --> 22:59.800
since someone called Great Aunt Phoebe...

22:59.880 --> 23:02.480
Who fell in love with a curate
who didn't love her back.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.080
She went away to Tonbridge Wells

23:04.160 --> 23:06.320
to mend her broken heart.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.800
Did Ambrose never tell you the story?

23:08.880 --> 23:10.120
No, no, he never did.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.244
She took a chill that lasted 20 years

23:13.880 --> 23:15.928
and then she fell in love again

23:16.040 --> 23:19.203
at first sight with another curate.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.440
Thank heavens this one loved her back.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.960
Yes. Thank heavens.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.123
She died on her wedding night.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.730
Oh, god. Of what?

23:31.720 --> 23:35.247
Of shock, I think.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.080
I think you just made that up.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.209
I did nothing of the sort.
Ask Seecombe.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.362
Perhaps tomorrow I could borrow a horse
and have a look around.

23:57.600 --> 24:02.080
Such an odd feeling,
driving up to the house,

24:02.160 --> 24:04.811
Seecombe standing
by the door to welcome me.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.651
I've done it so many times
in my imagination.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.120
The clock struck the hour
as we drove up.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.489
I even seemed to recognize
the sound of the bell.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.526
There...

24:34.280 --> 24:37.045
- You're tired.
- I'm not tired.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.240
- You're half-asleep.
- No, I'm not tired.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.560
I'm really not.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.520
Will you please stop being so polite

24:42.600 --> 24:43.720
and get up and go to bed.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.882
Of course. Of course.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.160
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.651
I, er...

24:51.960 --> 24:53.960
- Sorry. I...
- Good night!

24:54.040 --> 24:55.087
Yes...

25:00.240 --> 25:01.969
<i>Peter Welch.</i>

25:05.560 --> 25:06.971
Peter Welch.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.968
- Morning.
- Morning.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.360
<i>That's Bawden's meadow.</i>

25:33.440 --> 25:35.400
Then Kemp's creek.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.920
Er, Beef park.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.760
Beacon Hill.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.400
That's impossible.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.600
And then in the distance

25:42.680 --> 25:43.720
with the plow on it,

25:43.800 --> 25:48.408
that's the West Hill
and beyond it the East Hill.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.807
What else do you think
we talked about?

25:56.520 --> 25:58.600
Clearly I have no idea.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.765
All this was his passion.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.682
So I made it my passion too.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.800
<i>Everyone will be gawping at you.</i>

26:42.880 --> 26:44.644
<i>Then I shall just gawp back.</i>

26:51.200 --> 26:52.565
We're just here.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.160
The faculties of his mind

27:01.240 --> 27:03.800
are put into busy exercise

27:03.880 --> 27:07.640
in the steady direction of one
great and engrossing interest.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.326
His attention is recalled
from the many revelries...

27:10.440 --> 27:12.040
into which he might

27:12.120 --> 27:13.200
Otherwise have wandered.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.960
<i>And the powers of his body</i>

27:15.040 --> 27:18.000
<i>are forced away from an indolence...</i>

27:18.080 --> 27:19.800
That was the easy bit.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.840
I was afraid
that might be the case.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.480
Beautiful sermon.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.961
<i>And on that day,
as twilight falls,</i>

27:26.080 --> 27:27.680
the plowmen of the village,

27:27.760 --> 27:30.680
they draw their great plow
from door to door

27:30.760 --> 27:32.440
and they beg a free drink,

27:32.520 --> 27:35.680
and this is a great big plow

27:35.760 --> 27:37.400
drawn by a handsome brace of oxen.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.480
- My goodness.
- It's really...

27:38.560 --> 27:40.767
It's most, most arresting.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.286
- Beautiful.
<i>- Brava.</i>

28:13.000 --> 28:14.880
So very...

28:14.960 --> 28:16.644
Yes.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.443
<i>Un angelo passa...</i>

28:27.600 --> 28:29.080
Say again.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.606
An angel...
passes.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.960
Now, who will join me

28:43.040 --> 28:44.920
in drinking this delicious port wine?

28:45.000 --> 28:45.840
Oh, unless, of course,

28:45.920 --> 28:47.440
the men wish to retire
to the next room

28:47.520 --> 28:48.760
while we smoke our pipes.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.000
Thank you so much
for such a wonderful day.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.960
Louise, thank you so much for the flowers.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.240
- The beautiful flowers!
- You're very welcome!

29:03.320 --> 29:04.920
Thank you! Thank you!

29:05.000 --> 29:07.571
<i>You had better hurry
up and marry your Louise</i>

29:07.680 --> 29:10.445
before she gets snapped up
by someone else.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.760
She isn't my Louise.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.208
Really? Her father seems
to have other ideas.

29:17.560 --> 29:19.800
Why does everyone always assume
that Louise and I will many?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.166
Lift your feet.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.280
Sorry.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.120
She finds you very beautiful.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.725
Does she now?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.921
As do the Pascoe girls.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.769
How terribly flattering.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.480
The vicar does not agree.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.320
Oh, dear.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.280
- But he finds you feminine.
- Lift your feet.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.160
"Extremely feminine" were his exact words.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.084
I wonder in what way.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.680
I suppose in a way that's
different to Mrs. Pascoe.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.480
Mmm. And how would you define it?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.483
- Define what?
- The difference.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.400
Our femininity:

30:00.480 --> 30:02.721
Mrs. Pascoe's and mine.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.570
God knows.

30:07.440 --> 30:11.286
All I know is...
I like looking at you...

30:13.440 --> 30:16.011
and I don't like looking
at Mrs. Pascoe.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.920
All this nonsense about staying at Pelyn.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.240
What's wrong with staying here?

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
I'll stay until Seecombe
gets fed up with me.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.360
Seecombe? See...

30:30.440 --> 30:32.360
Seecombe has nothing to do with it.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.040
Or I run out of money.

30:34.120 --> 30:38.330
And am forced to give Italian lessons
to the bored wives of the gentry.

30:38.440 --> 30:39.680
No, no, no.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.400
Only spinsters teach.
Everybody knows that.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.680
Oh!

30:42.760 --> 30:44.400
And then only when
no one will support them.

30:44.480 --> 30:45.880
- And what about widows?
- Widows?

30:45.960 --> 30:49.840
Oh, well, widows remarry
as fast as they can.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.880
And if they can't do that,
they just...

30:51.960 --> 30:54.167
pawn their wedding rings.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.481
Well...

30:59.480 --> 31:02.802
I think I would prefer
to give Italian lessons.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.846
Good night, Philip.

31:09.960 --> 31:13.328
Idiot.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.485
Idiot, idiot.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.600
<i>What shall we give her?</i>

31:18.680 --> 31:21.968
Think of a figure that you
consider fair and reasonable.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.560
- Very well.
- Have you done it?

31:27.640 --> 31:28.880
- I have.
- It's in your head?

31:28.960 --> 31:31.725
- It is.
- Double it.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.760
If we're going to do this,
we have to do it properly.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.280
How Ambrose would have done it.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.080
As you wish.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.160
- Write the letter.
- Now?

31:42.240 --> 31:45.920
Oh! Were we expecting you today?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.207
- I've just, uh...
- Will you take something?

31:49.080 --> 31:50.920
I'm... but thanks.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.280
Did he give you coffee?

31:52.360 --> 31:53.920
Glad to see you've cheered up.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.960
What do you mean?

31:56.040 --> 31:59.408
Yesterday.
You seemed all down in the dumps.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.640
I'm amazed you noticed.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.120
We all did.
I'm surprised the Pascoe girls

32:05.200 --> 32:06.440
didn't remark on it.
Thank you.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.440
Well, the Pascoe girls
were probably far too busy

32:08.520 --> 32:09.726
remarking on something else.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.360
What?

32:11.440 --> 32:14.600
How easy it must be
for a woman like your cousin Rachel

32:14.680 --> 32:16.921
to twist you around her little finger.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.280
Get on.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.202
- Where is she?
- In the kitchen.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.646
- Doing what?
- Hard to tell.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.922
I do hope you don't mind.

32:46.640 --> 32:47.880
Not at all.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.202
- What is it?
<i>- Tisana.</i>

32:51.320 --> 32:53.000
It's Italian tea,

32:53.080 --> 32:55.480
infusions made from these herbs.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.562
Here, try.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.606
Try.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.769
It's, um, disgusting.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.840
It's good for you.
It's good for the health.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.040
Hmm.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.610
Where have you been?

33:21.080 --> 33:22.684
Out and about.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.000
You made him write this!

33:28.080 --> 33:30.000
What? What do you...

33:30.080 --> 33:31.560
I did nothing of the sort.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.360
If you had set out
to humiliate me, Philip,

33:34.440 --> 33:36.520
you really couldn't have
got off to a better start!

33:36.600 --> 33:37.760
- Why?
- Why?

33:37.840 --> 33:40.440
Because now it looks as if
I came begging to you!

33:40.520 --> 33:42.080
But you haven't. You didn't.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.845
Can't you let me be
a person in my own right?

33:44.960 --> 33:48.680
A woman who's making her way
in the world as she wishes to.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.680
Don't you see that if I had
wanted your money,

33:50.760 --> 33:52.040
I would have asked you for it?

33:52.120 --> 33:53.920
Don't you understand
it was just... It was a...

33:54.000 --> 33:56.360
It was a joke about the Italian lessons.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.440
- It wasn't a joke.
- Well, what if it wasn't?

33:58.520 --> 34:00.760
Is there something so terribly
shameful about that?

34:00.840 --> 34:02.040
Yes! Yes!

34:02.120 --> 34:04.407
You're Ambrose's wife.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.200
I, his heir, will not permit it.

34:06.280 --> 34:09.480
Do you understand?
I simply...

34:09.560 --> 34:13.531
I simply will not permit it.
Do you understand?

34:28.719 --> 34:30.484
God!

34:38.840 --> 34:40.922
You'd better take something up to her.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.411
Philip.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.530
Did I wake you?

35:27.080 --> 35:28.570
No.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.609
Thank you for the note.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.326
I was foul.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.610
I'm sorry.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.329
I would much rather
you hit me than to hear you cry.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.246
My mother...

36:00.160 --> 36:03.528
died before I can remember.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.642
I've never seen a woman cry.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.843
I shall accept the allowance...

36:12.120 --> 36:13.485
gratefully,

36:14.320 --> 36:15.845
but I should leave.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.528
- To go where?
- It doesn't matter where.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.680
I thought you liked being here.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.127
- Were you just being polite?
- Don't be a fool.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.600
If Ambrose hadn't been such an idiot,

36:30.680 --> 36:32.440
this place would have been your home.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.080
I think I'm the idiot.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.004
I thought coming here
would bring him back to life.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.486
I don't know why you came.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.842
I don't know anything about you.

36:59.360 --> 37:02.091
All I know is that I like it
now you're here...

37:03.800 --> 37:05.325
and I don't want you to go.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.725
Is that complicated?

37:09.640 --> 37:11.160
Very.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.800
If you want to go, then go.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.400
It'll cause a lot of talk, but...

37:14.480 --> 37:16.600
Well, I would have thought
it would cause a lot more talk

37:16.680 --> 37:17.920
if I stayed.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.920
I'll have to talk to your godfather.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.525
It's no concern of his.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.280
There is only one issue

37:24.360 --> 37:26.240
and that's whether
you want to stay or not.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.400
How can you ask me that?
You know the answer to that.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.760
No, I don't know.
Of course I don't know.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.730
I don't know...
That's the point.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.005
So you'll stay?

37:40.160 --> 37:42.561
- At least for a little while?
- I'll stay.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.800
Yes, for a little while.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.008
- Then I'll say good night.
- Good night.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.160
- And I hope you'll sleep.
- You too.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.280
And not be angry with me.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.442
I wasn't angry with you, Philip.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.526
Come here.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.406
Bend down.

38:11.600 --> 38:15.082
Now go to bed like a good boy. Go. Go.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.360
- She's ready.
- Yes, I can see.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.080
Er, anything more for the mail?

38:39.160 --> 38:40.080
Yes.

38:40.160 --> 38:43.040
In fact, why don't you leave
that with me, Wellington?

38:43.120 --> 38:46.647
- We can drop it off on our way.
- Very good, sir.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.762
Hurry up.

39:15.320 --> 39:19.848
This is a <i>tisana</i> made with
fennel and rose hips.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.960
All together...

39:23.040 --> 39:25.040
it's going to make you better.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.960
<i>They'll think you're a witch.</i>

39:27.040 --> 39:30.200
Or worse, they'll call for you
in the middle of the night

39:30.280 --> 39:31.400
to deliver babies.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.200
Hmm,
there's a <i>tisana</i> for that too.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.720
See. Witch.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.451
Why should women
suffer in childbirth?

39:37.560 --> 39:39.680
Is it simply their destiny to do so?

39:39.760 --> 39:40.960
I've never thought about it.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.600
No, of course you haven't.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.682
You know nothing about women.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.320
I do hope I haven't
said anything to hurt you.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.080
Nothing.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.367
Then what is it, Philip? Please tell me.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.526
Please.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.250
You need to read
inside the envelope itself.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.800
"She has done for me at last.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.564
Rachel, my torment.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.046
Please come quickly."

41:13.400 --> 41:15.721
How you have hated me.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.891
Yes.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.450
That's no use.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.008
You're not the woman I hated.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.680
If you don't want them, Philip,

41:43.760 --> 41:45.560
do you think we might let the people

41:45.640 --> 41:47.520
who live on the estate, who loved him,

41:47.600 --> 41:49.720
have his clothes?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.643
That's an excellent idea.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.282
What do we do with it all?

42:10.840 --> 42:12.360
I don't know.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.602
Do you think you could wear any of it?

42:16.480 --> 42:17.481
No.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.483
I feel it is as if we've just
opened up his coffin.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.642
And we're staring down at him.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.971
Rachel?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.729
It's all right. Don't cry.

43:04.720 --> 43:05.960
Don't cry. It's all right.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.326
It's all right. It's all right.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.640
- I don't want her to know.
- Sir?

43:34.720 --> 43:36.245
About the tree.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.091
- I want it to be a surprise.
- Very good.

43:40.920 --> 43:44.606
Not like that, you fucking prick-wit!

43:45.560 --> 43:47.050
It's all crooked!

43:47.880 --> 43:49.640
- Sorry, sir.
- Not at all.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.324
Where is she, by the way?

43:51.440 --> 43:52.771
In her room.

43:53.720 --> 43:56.400
It looks like the Leaning Tower of <i>Pisa.</i>

43:56.480 --> 43:57.520
Get it straightened up.

43:57.600 --> 43:58.640
<i>All right, come in.</i>

44:01.640 --> 44:04.211
Oh, it's you! No, don't look.

44:04.920 --> 44:07.840
Go away. Go.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.969
<i>I need something special, Mr. Couch.</i>

44:12.800 --> 44:14.450
Aren't they beautiful?

44:15.440 --> 44:17.480
I've never seen anything quite like it.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.360
It's the finest piece
in the whole collection.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.441
No question of it.

44:23.240 --> 44:26.005
No one's worn them for 25 years.

44:27.480 --> 44:29.528
Not since your mother's wedding.

44:34.040 --> 44:38.080
Well... I want it now.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.360
Is that prudent?
What if it should be lost or mislaid?

44:40.440 --> 44:42.522
It won't be lost, Mr. Couch.

44:43.680 --> 44:46.200
And if you're worried about
what my godfather might say,

44:46.280 --> 44:48.400
please rest assured
that he wholly approves.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.840
Nevertheless, as your family
lawyer for all these years,

44:50.920 --> 44:53.520
I would have preferred Mr. Kendall
to have been present.

44:53.600 --> 44:56.524
As I say, he's away.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.080
- John.
- Sir?

45:08.160 --> 45:10.731
Take this to the mistress, if you will.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.006
Very good, sir.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.524
Thank you.

46:45.760 --> 46:47.285
Thank you.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.320
Good evening.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.880
Good evening.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.364
It's so beautiful.

47:38.320 --> 47:42.200
<i>There were three ravens on a tree</i>

47:42.280 --> 47:46.080
<i>Hey, down down, hey, down.</i>

47:46.160 --> 47:50.040
<i>The first one says "What's this I see?"</i>

47:50.120 --> 47:54.600
<i>There lies a dead man in yon lea.</i>

47:54.680 --> 47:58.240
<i>Hey, down down, down.</i>

47:58.320 --> 48:02.400
<i>We'll sit all on his old breastbone.</i>

48:02.480 --> 48:05.920
<i>Hey, down down, hey, down.</i>

48:06.000 --> 48:09.960
<i>We'll sit all on his old breastbone.</i>

48:10.040 --> 48:11.769
Timothy.

48:14.520 --> 48:15.601
Geoffrey.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.046
Reverend Pascoe.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.480
It is. Oh, it is.

48:42.560 --> 48:43.760
Thank you for our gifts.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.120
Thank Mrs. Ashley.

48:45.200 --> 48:46.160
I will do.

48:46.240 --> 48:47.400
Happy Christmas!

48:47.480 --> 48:50.290
Bye, Belinda, Mary. Bye-bye.
Good luck tomorrow. Thank you.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.731
- Where are the others?
- Upstairs, I think.

49:04.560 --> 49:07.564
Actually I'm glad of this
chance to have a quiet word.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.120
Yes?

49:11.200 --> 49:13.760
I've had some news from the bank.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.200
Oh, yes.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.760
Some rather disturbing news, in fact.

49:21.680 --> 49:25.924
Your cousin is already
severely overdrawn on her account.

49:28.280 --> 49:31.120
I can only think she's been
sending money out of the country.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.680
To who?

49:35.280 --> 49:37.840
Nonsense. No, no.

49:37.920 --> 49:40.685
She's just generous.

49:41.400 --> 49:44.200
Tonight, for example, you saw...

49:44.280 --> 49:46.480
A gift for every family in the room.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.240
That won't account
for an overdraft of this magnitude.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.600
Then there's all this...
The fabrics, the curtains...

49:51.680 --> 49:53.040
Again, I hardly think shop...

49:53.120 --> 49:55.964
Shh. You simply just must
increase the allowance.

49:59.280 --> 50:01.282
- Increase?
- Yes.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.085
Cover the overdraft.

50:09.080 --> 50:11.321
I've been doing a little asking around.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.720
Did you know that the duel
in which her first husband died

50:15.800 --> 50:17.560
was fought over one of her lovers?

50:17.640 --> 50:19.640
I don't believe that.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.200
They were notorious,

50:21.280 --> 50:22.880
both him and her,

50:22.960 --> 50:25.201
for unbridled extravagance

50:26.120 --> 50:29.602
and apparently... limitless...

50:31.600 --> 50:33.011
appetite.

50:38.200 --> 50:39.850
Do you understand?

50:43.040 --> 50:44.326
Do you?

50:50.480 --> 50:53.440
I never thought you'd fall so low

50:53.520 --> 50:55.966
as to listen to gossip of that sort.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.600
You had no right to take that necklace.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.600
It's mine and it's from the estate.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.760
The estate is not yet yours,
as you well know.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.569
What of it? It will be soon.

51:10.040 --> 51:14.360
I must ask you to desire her
to return the collar.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.805
Really?

51:17.160 --> 51:20.528
Well, that's the last thing
in the world I intend to do.

51:21.400 --> 51:22.845
Then I must do it for you.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.240
And I'll be damned if you will.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.401
Here.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.600
Louise explained.

51:33.680 --> 51:36.120
It was quite right
that you ask for their return.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.885
- No.
- Please, Philip.

51:39.880 --> 51:43.600
It was a great honor to wear them
on such a special evening. Thank you.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.967
I want you to wear them every night.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.600
Do you need wrapping for them?

51:48.680 --> 51:50.120
No, thank you.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.521
Ah. There.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.000
- You'll regret this.
- Be quiet.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.200
You're a fool.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.000
Thank you for a delightful

51:59.080 --> 52:01.242
and successful evening, Philip.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.520
Let's hope the dancing doesn't keep you
awake all night.

52:04.600 --> 52:05.760
Oh, yes.

52:05.840 --> 52:08.680
May I wish you both
a very Happy Christmas?

52:08.760 --> 52:10.840
Oh, and you too.
Merry, Merry Christmas.

52:10.920 --> 52:14.520
- Happy Christmas.
- Happy Christmas, Louise.

52:14.600 --> 52:17.000
- Good night, Philip.
- Happy Christmas, Philip.

52:17.080 --> 52:18.720
Good night.

52:18.800 --> 52:20.840
- Thank you again.
- Oh, thank you so much.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.320
Such a memorable evening.

52:22.400 --> 52:23.680
The snow's still falling.

52:23.760 --> 52:26.720
Keep warm. Don't get wet.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.680
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy Christmas.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.808
Happy Christmas!

52:40.760 --> 52:42.922
I wanted you to wear it...

52:45.280 --> 52:46.680
to have it.

52:46.760 --> 52:49.600
- Hush.
- Everything is ruined.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.490
My mother wore those pearls
on her wedding day...

52:54.720 --> 52:56.529
and my grandmother...

52:57.520 --> 52:59.522
and her mother before her.

53:01.480 --> 53:04.360
That's why I was so proud
and happy to wear them.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.280
Had I been married here and not in Italy,

53:07.360 --> 53:08.805
I should have worn them too.

53:11.440 --> 53:13.000
Don't be sad.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.880
Happy Christmas, dear, dear Philip.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.724
We must go back to the party

53:17.840 --> 53:19.444
because the guests are waiting for you.

53:20.480 --> 53:22.482
Happy Christmas, Philip.

53:25.320 --> 53:28.400
By rights, the jewels are yours anyway.

53:28.480 --> 53:31.000
Not just the jewels, everything.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.411
I'm sure there must be a will.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.363
- There was.
- Ah-ha.

53:34.480 --> 53:35.920
But it was never signed.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.400
Do you have it? Can I see it?

53:38.480 --> 53:40.080
<i>He leaves you everything.</i>

53:40.160 --> 53:42.003
But it's not signed.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.967
So? It's his handwriting.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
January.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.120
Do you know why he chose
January to make his will?

53:51.200 --> 53:52.725
And then chose not to sign it?

53:55.440 --> 53:56.930
I lost a child.

53:59.960 --> 54:02.611
- Something else died, too.
- What?

54:04.120 --> 54:07.880
Hope? I don't know.

54:07.960 --> 54:11.009
His belief in me, in us.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.365
It made him ill.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.722
I'd never felt so alone.

54:21.400 --> 54:26.042
One day, I woke up and I found myself...

54:30.120 --> 54:32.646
living with a stranger...

54:35.520 --> 54:36.885
who hated me...

54:38.560 --> 54:40.369
and wanted to hurt me.

54:47.560 --> 54:50.928
There is no bitter feeling in this house.

54:53.160 --> 54:54.605
You belong here now.

54:57.400 --> 54:59.323
Just as he did.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.480
Thank you.

55:09.280 --> 55:13.520
There doesn't appear to be any proviso
should Mrs. Ashley marry again.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.600
That's not likely to happen.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.808
But the point should be
covered, should it not?

55:18.760 --> 55:20.250
If you insist.

55:22.760 --> 55:25.400
In case of marriage,
her property should revert to you.

55:25.480 --> 55:27.926
Unless, presumably, you predecease her?

55:28.960 --> 55:32.440
Er, yes, yes. Very well.

55:32.520 --> 55:36.360
You are a stickler for these things,
aren't you, Mr. Couch?

55:36.440 --> 55:40.445
Well, that's my job,
Master Ashley... to stickle.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.880
And you would like this to be ready

55:45.960 --> 55:49.360
and drawn up in legal form
by your 25th birthday?

55:49.440 --> 55:51.560
Yes, on the day
that the property falls to me.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.971
Absolutely.

55:54.320 --> 55:56.971
You're doing a very generous thing,
if I may say so.

55:58.200 --> 56:01.409
Giving everything away
the very moment it becomes yours.

56:02.240 --> 56:04.208
Generous, one might say,
to the point of...

56:06.640 --> 56:08.244
Rashness?

56:09.640 --> 56:11.324
Will you do as I ask?

56:18.320 --> 56:19.845
Well?

56:43.400 --> 56:45.164
Oh, Philip.

56:47.160 --> 56:48.889
We have a guest.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.320
- What a surprise.
- Such a charming house.

56:54.400 --> 56:55.800
I hope you don't mind,
your cousin

56:55.880 --> 56:57.600
has been giving me the grand tour.

56:57.680 --> 57:00.600
And much grander
than I had been led to believe.

57:00.680 --> 57:03.160
<i>Benito Casteluccio had brought
you an enormous bunch of flowers.</i>

57:03.240 --> 57:05.129
- Cosimo was furious.
- So angry.

57:41.760 --> 57:43.842
I came to wish you good night.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.442
I wish you the same.

57:52.480 --> 57:54.847
He's a very old friend...

57:56.320 --> 57:58.448
and we had a lot to talk about.

57:59.320 --> 58:00.924
Of course.

58:02.520 --> 58:03.840
Well?

58:03.920 --> 58:07.891
Who exactly is Benito Casteluccio?

58:09.480 --> 58:12.040
And why did he bring you flowers?

58:12.120 --> 58:15.920
He was old and very fat...

58:16.760 --> 58:19.047
and his breath smelled of cigars.

58:21.400 --> 58:23.528
I'm sorry. You've been so good.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.124
He's leaving in the morning.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.680
It's excellent, Mr. Couch.

58:38.760 --> 58:40.360
Quite excellent.

58:40.440 --> 58:42.329
Everything's as we discussed.

58:46.600 --> 58:49.200
And you're quite determined

58:49.280 --> 58:51.080
that this is what you want to do,

58:51.160 --> 58:52.525
Master Ashley?

58:54.120 --> 58:56.400
Quite determined?

58:56.480 --> 58:59.324
There is another thing,
Mr. Couch, if you don't mind?

59:08.680 --> 59:12.651
- All of them, Master Ashley?
- All of them, Mr. Couch.

59:35.840 --> 59:37.569
Does she have any knowledge of this?

59:38.760 --> 59:40.205
None whatsoever.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.960
And you're quite determined
on this course?

59:44.040 --> 59:45.280
Quite.

59:56.200 --> 59:59.400
You're completely infatuated
with your cousin, are you not?

59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.480
I'm just doing what I believe is right.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.840
You realize you could lose everything?

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.160
I'm willing to take that risk.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.440
Unless she marries.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.000
- For a third time.
- That's unlikely.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.280
I don't suppose you've thought
of asking her yourself?

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.725
Why. have you?

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.606
Very well.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.009
Let's, er...

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.840
- If you, erm...
- Yes.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.922
- Just here.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.606
Thank you.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.925
There.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.804
Thank you.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.325
Thank you for your affection
for me and for Ambrose.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.211
And your good guardianship
over the years.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.760
Guardianship which ends tomorrow.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.491
Tonight, in fact at midnight.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.600
Then happy birthday, Philip,

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.524
tonight, at midnight.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.524
I don't suppose you want to see Louise?

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.485
- Is she here?
- Yes, I think so.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.644
- I think I should...
- No.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.080
Why don't you ride over tomorrow?

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.811
The two of you? Drink my health?

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.530
Morning, Joshua!

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.044
Master Ashley!

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.727
Master Ashley!

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.364
I'm all right! I'm all right!

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.611
There, boy.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.520
You're lucky the whole cliff
didn't fall down on top of you.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.320
- Good boy. There we go.
- I was miles away.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.641
There we go. Hey, steady now.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.640
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.087
- It's all right.
- Don't you want this one?

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.720
Take on a hedge, did we, sir?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.600
Cliff path.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.680
Gorran Head. Damn path
fell into the sea beneath me.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.720
Yes. Full moon, spring tide.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.928
Damn near went in after it.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.280
<i>Rachel.</i>

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.160
Rachel.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.050
- What is it?
- I've got something for you.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.883
I'm asleep.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.166
Philip.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.370
What are you doing?

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.840
You're going to break your neck.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.365
Ow.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.449
You'll break your neck.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.967
It's all right. I made it.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.002
I'm a little old for Juliet,
don't you think?

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.683
This...

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.528
I want you to read later.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.691
But this...

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.731
I want you to have now.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.440
You've gone...
You've gone completely mad.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.761
Look, I'm 25. I can do whatever I want.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.050
Wear this.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.128
There's only one thing I want...

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.288
er, but I won't ask for it.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.403
- Why not?
- Because you'd slap my face.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.041
Tell me.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.566
I know... I...

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.761
I know now what I lack.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.526
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.760
Are you sure?

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.640
I'm sure.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.811
Happy birthday.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.361
<i>John!</i>

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.960
- John.
- Sir?

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.720
- I want a picnic packed.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.120
- Picnic for two, bottle of wine.
- Very good, sir.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.406
Wellington!

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.085
Wellington!

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.880
- Where is it?
- What, sir?

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.080
The carriage.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.209
Don't you know? Er, mistress took it, sir.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.120
Where'd they go?

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.645
No idea. Town?

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.279
It's a lovely day for your birthday,
Master Ashley.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.805
Yes, it is.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.450
A lovely day.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.682
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.484
Where have you been?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.241
I've been waiting all morning. Where...

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.600
- Do you want some?
- No, thank you.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.280
- Where have you been?
- I've been to Pelyn to see your godfather.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.080
What for?

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.000
Well, the wording of your document
was a little obscure

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.846
and I wanted to be absolutely sure
that I knew what it meant.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.285
And is it clear now?

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.771
Quite clear.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.880
Put up your veil.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.160
I know your godfather disapproves of me,

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.800
but he was very sweet.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.080
We even made a plan to meet up in London.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.880
You don't still intend
to go to London, do you?

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.371
Why ever not?

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.922
Oh, how pretty it is.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.326
- Sit for a moment.
- I'm not tired.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.400
Just for a moment.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.560
I've been sitting
in that carriage for hours.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.800
So have I,

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.720
sitting like an idiot at the front door

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.520
waiting for you to come back.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.090
There.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.130
This was my plan...

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.962
which you have spoilt...

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.480
by lunching with the dull old Kendalls.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.086
I rather thought it might be.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.450
Let me get up.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.680
Oh...

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.566
Here.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.971
Thank you.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.240
If I'd known I was coming into a fortune,

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.971
I would have given you
a considerably larger pearl.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.684
It's lovely. Thank you.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.445
Shall we go?

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.880
Mistress's compliments.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.530
What is it?

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.926
Twig soup.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.725
Special brew, she says. Birthday brew.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.002
Says you've got to drink the lot.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.440
And then he proceeded

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.840
to dance around the house,

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.000
up and down the stairs, up and down,

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.280
and, really,

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.647
it was the oddest jig you've ever seen.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.840
Philip.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.520
- Philip?
- Philip. Philip.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.250
To you.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.600
Long life and happiness.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.840
- To Philip.
- To you.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.160
I, er...

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.970
I too have a toast to make,
erm, tonight.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.605
Oh.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.841
Since this morning I have been...

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.602
the happiest of men.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.080
And I want you, my godfather,

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.970
and you, dear, dear Louise,

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.889
to drink to my happiness.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.930
And the reason for such happiness...

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.121
the woman to be my wife.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.721
Rachel.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.924
My darling.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.729
Have you gone out of your mind?

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.003
Of course not.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.966
Please.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:48.320
I think that the birthday excitement
has gone to Philip's head,

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.244
and I think that we should
retire to the next room.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.001
I have known shame in my life.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.731
Terrible shame...

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.241
but this is the worst.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.840
You weren't ashamed last night.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.640
You weren't ashamed this afternoon.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.165
Ashamed of what?

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.560
Of... of...

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.244
Why should I be ashamed of that?

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.960
You asked me... You asked me
what it was that I lacked,

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.884
and I said the only thing that I lacked...

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.480
Oh, my god.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.130
Was...

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.646
Was...

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.281
Was you.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.200
No. Oh, god.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.480
- Didn't you enjoy it?
- Well, didn't you?

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.561
You know I did.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.880
Good. I wanted you to enjoy it.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.000
- I wanted to thank you.
- For what?

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.760
For what? For everything.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.720
For... For being so kind to me,

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.480
for the jewels.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.680
What did you... did you...

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.440
Did you think you had bought me?

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.120
Wait. Wait. Please, please, please.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.680
- Kiss me, please.
- Let go of my arm.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.160
Kiss me, please. Just kiss me.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.240
- Let go of my arm.
- Kiss me.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.845
- Kiss me, please.
- Let go of me.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.445
I've been worried about you for so long.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.802
Since before Christmas.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.082
You know nothing about her.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.482
Or is it you who know nothing?

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.524
It's no use.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.440
I'm fond of you and you of me,

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.080
but if we keep on talking,

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.844
we'll end up hating each other.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.801
Do you love her so very much?

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.800
Don't think I don't know
how much of a fool

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.723
I must appear to you.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.968
I asked her to marry me.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.963
I shall continue to ask her.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.521
When exactly did you ask her?

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.361
The moment I came of age. Yesterday.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.251
- My god, yesterday.
- What did she say?

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.051
I thought she said yes, but...

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.200
In fact, she meant no.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.800
Was this before or after
she read the document?

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.960
Before. She read it the morning after.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.560
And wasted no time
in driving over to see us.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.400
She said she didn't fully understand it.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.320
Well, she understood it
pretty damn well by the time she left.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.240
We stood on the steps in the sunshine

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.840
waiting for her carriage

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.840
and my father said to her,

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.000
"The marriage clause may
strike you as a little hard.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.163
You must remain a widow
if you want to keep your fortune."

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.680
And what did she...
What did she say?

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.000
She just smiled and put on her gloves

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.924
and said, "That suits me very well."

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.120
That clause is to protect the estate.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.040
If she were my wife...
of course it wouldn't apply.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.960
No. No, you're wrong.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.880
If she marries you, or anyone else,

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.000
then everything, the house,
everything, reverts to you.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.520
But I'd share
everything with her,

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.600
every penny.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.040
She knows that.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.602
A wife can't send money
out of the country.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.560
A wife would have to live here,

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.961
in England, with her husband.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.640
- The peg moves forward.
- Moves forward two points.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.200
- And play.
- Oh, don't we say "muggins"?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.851
- Muggins. Muggins. Muggins.
- Muggins.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.200
Hello, Philip.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.200
I invited Mary Pascoe
to stay in the house with me,

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.240
as my companion.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.280
I do hope you approve.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.840
Do you play? It's cribbage.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.080
- Can I speak to you?
- Yes.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.880
- I can teach you if you like.
- Alone.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.646
Well, anything you want to say
can be said in front of Mary.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.760
I don't want to be in the way.
Let me go into my room.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.040
Leave the door open, Mary,
so you may hear me if I need you.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.122
Yes, certainly, Mrs. Ashley.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.760
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.888
Don't close the door.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.160
After last night,
I cannot be alone with you.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.324
Please don't do this.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.326
I don't feel safe with you.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.245
I beg you.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.760
<i>Goodness me. If I were you,</i>

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.286
<i>I would get Dr. Smalls
to have a look at that.</i>

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.602
Thank god.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.131
You're back.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.880
There.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:48.007
- Rachel...
- Don't speak.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.651
Here.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.162
How long was I out?

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.644
Five days.

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.922
And the Pascoe girl?

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.761
Sent packing.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.329
Keep still. Keep still.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.240
<i>Glad to see</i>

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.920
<i>Wellington's cutting back the laburnum.</i>

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.560
What's that?

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.360
Well, if a horse gets a mouthful of that,

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440
it would kill them.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.800
Oh, yes. You had one in Italy.

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.530
Did I?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.680
By the fountain in a pot.
Do you remember?

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.966
Did I?

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.640
Well, I can't be expected
to remember everything.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.721
Here.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.165
Drink.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.521
Where do you go?

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.320
Where?

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.607
Are you worried I'll tire the horses?

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.242
No. No.

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.962
I'm worried you're about to leave.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.650
Are you leaving me?

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:36.920
You should have left me to die.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.286
Don't.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.240
Soon none of this will seem quite so bad.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.004
You belong here.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.360
In a little while you'll be strong again

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.728
and everything will be
just as it was before I came.

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.287
You are at the beginning of everything.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.006
A boy.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.847
How can I live with a boy?

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.366
However lovely.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.845
Hmm?

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.005
A glorious puppy...

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.931
wandering around,
miserable and wet-nosed,

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.122
looking for its mother.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.886
Drink.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.531
Drink.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.400
<i>"She's going through
all the money like water,</i>

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.801
<i>grasping, greedy for everything,</i>

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.247
<i>but clever too, cunning.</i>

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.760
<i>It's a disease. She can't help herself.</i>

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.320
<i>She'll take every single penny.</i>

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.920
<i>She'll ruin me.</i>

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.243
<i>She'll ruin us. She'll ruin everything."</i>

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.245
What is that?

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.526
Nothing.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.045
What was it?

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.524
Nothing. It was...

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.090
Why is he here?

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.920
- Because I asked him.
- Why?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.440
Why not? I needed advice.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.490
- What for?
- Not your business.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:04.440
How long have you been lying to me?

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.600
You hate him.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.280
If I'd told you he was here,

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.040
it would have made you sick again.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.320
Send him away. Send him away!

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.280
- Why don't I bring him here?
- Are you mad?

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.960
He can stay here as my protector.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.720
- He can stay in my bedroom.
- You wouldn't dare.

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.960
Why not? Why not?

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.361
Why shouldn't I
have a life of my own

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.960
and make a life for myself
and do as I please?

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.040
This house is mine, after all, isn't it?

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.282
- Isn't it mine?
- God!

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:41.720
Get away from me. Stay away from me!

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:45.009
Or I will call the servants.
You stay away.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.400
Do you want to be shamed
in front of the servants?

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.164
Do you?

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.245
Go on.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.723
Call for them.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.480
For all of them.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.766
Go on.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.846
Tell them what's happened here between us.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.931
All of it.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.440
Put an end to it.

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.124
I'm too tired.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.610
I'm too tired to fight.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.888
I can't do this again.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.130
I can't.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.971
All of this.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:07.327
Even... Even the hands at my throat.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.165
I can't.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.247
I can't do it all again.

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.280
<i>I was very grateful</i>

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.120
<i>for Master Ambrose's coat, Master Ashley,</i>

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.520
<i>very grateful.</i>

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.760
And I had never put it on
before yesterday.

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.440
It's too good for me, I thought.

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:53.440
I was very grateful for it,
Master Ashley, very grateful.

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.560
And I put my hand in the pocket

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:57.440
and there it was, Master Ashley, sir,

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.760
there it was.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.842
Still sealed.
Still sealed.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.080
<i>"You are the only person</i>

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:06.491
<i>in the world I can trust.</i>

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.564
<i>Drop everything. Come out to me.</i>

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.642
<i>Only come straightaway.</i>

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.210
<i>I fear for my life.</i>

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.043
The headaches, the sickness, the fever,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.002
suddenly I understand.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.044
The bitter potions, poisoning me.

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:38.370
All this time she's been poisoning me."

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.089
I've been a fool.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.120
<i>In Florence,</i>

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.560
I used to brew the <i>tisana</i> in the <i>salotto</i>

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.560
and then let it stand for a while.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.600
And then we would go out
into the little courtyard,

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:44.040
if it wasn't too hot, and sit,

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.320
and I would turn on the fountain

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.640
and we would sip the <i>tisana.</i>

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.080
Hmm.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.640
Ambrose would sit there for hours.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.720
Hmm.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.200
Here.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.880
Oh, no, not that one. That's Philip's.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.007
Thank you.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.760
- Here.
- No, thank you.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.240
Oh, but this is a special batch.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.480
I've made it double strength.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.483
Well, then, you drink it for me.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.330
What do you think?

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.687
Hmm.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.841
Mmm!

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.160
It's, erm...

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.080
It's very interesting.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.920
Ha!

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.240
I think it might take me a
while to fall in love with it.

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.842
Who'll come riding with me?

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.960
Oh, we could take the carriage,

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.280
if you prefer.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.320
You go.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.440
Louise and I have
some business to discuss.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.120
You do?

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.362
What a waste, on a day like this.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.209
Very well. I shall go on my own.

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:11.763
I won't be long. Finish your tea.

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.360
<i>Where are you off to?</i>

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.320
I don't know. Up Barton Hill, perhaps,

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.731
or into the woods.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.200
Do you think the bluebells
are still there?

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:29.120
The bluebells are long gone, I'm afraid.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.160
Ah.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.160
- You might try the cliff path.
- Yes, that's an idea.

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.767
There are seal pups
this time of year off Gorran Head.

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.208
You're looking better.

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.800
You look...

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:48.921
beautiful.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.125
I'm sorry.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.920
What are we looking for?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.970
Laburnum seeds, letters. I don't know.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.720
She poisoned Ambrose
and now she's poisoning me.

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.040
Don't you see?

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.520
It's Couch. It's the lawyer.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.040
"We thank you
for the return of the jewels,

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.480
which according to your instruction
will remain with us

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.400
until your heir, Philip Ashley,
may take possession of them."

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.766
Oh, so...

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.408
So she's giving them back.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.000
<i>The jewelry, she's giving it back.</i>

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.640
<i>Keep looking.</i>

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.240
Philip, I don't know what
we're looking for anymore.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.971
- Shouldn't we just...
- Keep looking, please!

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.171
Here, it's in Italian.
It's Rainaldi, it must be.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:06.680
Is it him?

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.520
It's signed Enrico. Is that right?

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.840
Yes, that's him, yes.

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:11.360
<i>Well, translate it for me, please.</i>

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.680
<i>"Dearest Rachel,</i>

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:13.960
<i>on second thoughts,</i>

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.440
<i>if you really cannot bring yourself</i>

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.966
to leave the boy behind,

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.120
bring him with you.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.280
I still don't think it's a good idea,

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.280
but, then again, Italy and some sunshine

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.966
may be the making of him."

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.484
Is that it?

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:44.571
Philip, inquiries were made.
My father...

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.640
What inquiries?

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.121
In matters of the heart,
it seems that...

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:55.850
Enrico Rainaldi is more Greek
than he is Italian.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.644
He likes boys, Philip.

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.485
Wellington!

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.322
- I'll get a saddle!
- Damn the saddle!

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.162
<i>Who's to blame?</i>

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.490
<i>I was an orphan.</i>

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.802
<i>Ambrose took me in.</i>

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.649
<i>He was my cousin,</i>

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.002
<i>but I loved him like a father.</i>

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.802
<i>Now I'm a father.</i>

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.129
<i>What can I teach them?</i>

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.923
<i>What can I tell them?</i>

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.442
<i>Headaches blind me.</i>

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.331
<i>Was she?</i>

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.371
<i>Did she?</i>

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.041
<i>Didn't she?</i>

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:26.961
<i>Rachel, my torment.</i>
