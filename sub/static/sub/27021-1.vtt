00:35.640 --> 00:36.520
[driver] Yah.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.320
[narrator] That woman there
is my grandmother,

00:42.400 --> 00:47.360
a hardy sort who had to raise
a family of four all by herself.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.960
As I remember,
she wouldn't say boo to a goose.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.920
[yells] Angela, you're late!

00:53.440 --> 00:55.920
[narrator chuckles]
There's my Uncle Tom.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.640
Though he was only ten at that time,
he was still the man of the family.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.120
He's holding my auntie Aggie.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.840
Some called her
the most handsome lady in Limerick.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.480

01:09.560 --> 01:11.880

I couldn't get it on her, Mammy,
and Angela's late again.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.840
That child will have me above
in St. Jeremiah's asylum.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.680
Mammy says you'll have her in the asylum

01:39.600 --> 01:40.760
Thank you, Angela.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.360
Late again, I see.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.760
Yes. Hello, Mrs. Blake.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
[sighs]

01:45.920 --> 01:49.640
-Pat, give your jacket to Angela.
-What? My jacket to Angela?

01:49.720 --> 01:52.000
-Get your own jacket.
-No more messing about.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.280
-Here.
-Tom, you give yours to Pat.

01:54.360 --> 01:55.200
[Aggie chuckles]

01:55.280 --> 01:58.600
[narrator] And this is a story
about the Christmas Eve...

01:58.680 --> 02:01.120
You look like a clown,
all big and bulky like--

02:01.200 --> 02:04.520
-[mother] Pat!
-...when she was nearly six years old.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.280
-I'm grand.
-I won't see you catching your death.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.280
I don't want to wear my ma's coat to Mass.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.200
-[Aggie chuckles]
-Then take my scarf.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.480
Right, come on.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.920
[mother] It'll be Christmas Day
before we get there.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.080
Ha! ♪ Angela's wearing boy's clothes ♪

02:39.160 --> 02:42.520

03:00.640 --> 03:02.120
-I'm telling Mam.
-[Pat] You're not.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.440
She'll send you to bed
without even a cup of tea.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.520
Shut up. She won't.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.680
When you take a coin from her purse,
you're punished.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.080
Imagine what she would do
for pushing me under a horse.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.040
-Hurry up, the pair of you.
-Pat pushed me.

03:13.120 --> 03:13.960
I didn't.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.880
-[mother] Get in.
-[narrator] Ah. St. Joseph's.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.240
A church so cold,

03:20.320 --> 03:22.120
if you didn't go in with a cough,

03:22.200 --> 03:25.640
you certainly came out with one.
[chuckles]

03:26.080 --> 03:29.800
[priest] It is a time for reflection

03:29.880 --> 03:34.600
and a time to help those less fortunate
and to forgive foes

03:34.680 --> 03:36.520
and those who've sinned against us.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.160
-Telltale.

just stop fighting for one minute?

04:07.440 --> 04:11.320
As it is written in Luke,"
"'For unto you was born this day

04:50.360 --> 04:52.160
[sermon continues]

04:52.400 --> 04:56.280
[narrator] It was about this time
that Angela had a little idea.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.360
It made perfect sense,

05:00.040 --> 05:04.880
but little ideas
are often the seeds of big trouble.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.200

You've all had your say.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.880
Now I want to tell you a story--

17:19.960 --> 17:21.800
one about the night you were born.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.400
-I was born on New Year.
-Stroke of midnight.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.880
Head in the old year, feet in the new.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.520
We were gonna write to the Pope
to ask what year you were born in.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.520
We can't be listening to stories
with the baby Jesus on the table.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.400
The night you were born,
it was bitterly cold.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.680
[chuckles]

17:46.760 --> 17:49.040
So cold that the midwife kept her coat on.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.520
[mother] She was young, in love,

17:52.720 --> 17:55.120
with the new year
and a new suitor waiting.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.120
But what no one knew
was that my own heart was breaking.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.440
-Happy New Year.
-[Angela cries]

18:03.360 --> 18:05.080
Why was your heart breaking, Mam?

18:06.680 --> 18:07.920
Your father.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.240
-Go in and meet your sister, boys.
-[boys chuckle]

18:15.000 --> 18:17.760
[mother] Your father didn't want the baby
being born into a cold house.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.040
Hi, babba.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.080
[mother] So he went out
to get coal for the fire.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.320
I got word shortly before Angela was born.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.000
[Angela cries]

18:29.960 --> 18:32.480
[mother] The guards locked
your father up in the Limerick jail

18:33.000 --> 18:36.400
for trying to take a few lumps of coal
off the back of the fuel cart.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.080
Sure, he was just trying to do
the right thing,

18:43.720 --> 18:45.360
just trying to warm the house.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.520
[Angela cries]

18:49.640 --> 18:52.440
[mother] It should have been
one of the happiest days of our lives.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.560
Instead, my heart was broken in pieces.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.840

19:04.520 --> 19:05.680
In you go, Pat.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.920
[mother] Together, we were warm.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.440
Because that is what families do.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.200
They shelter each other from the storm.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.200

19:25.640 --> 19:27.920
warmth where there is none.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.400
Your father wasn't proud
of his actions that night,

19:36.400 --> 19:39.360
but when he heard
how you boys minded your mother,

19:40.320 --> 19:42.800
when he saw his baby daughter
for the first time,

19:43.720 --> 19:46.720
he was the proudest man in Limerick.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.800
I miss Dadda.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.720
I know you do, Pat. We all do.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.080
He needs to go home.

-Huh?

20:29.480 --> 20:30.520

20:31.040 --> 20:33.080

[Angela] Come on.

only go and thank the both of us?

You won't.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.320
You can put me in the Limerick jail.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.880
He was cold in the crib,
so I took him home to warm him up.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.160
Well, then.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.880

but to lock you up

about taking a child,

on Christmas Eve.
