But I'm not always gonna

Anyone have a problem
with that?

26:01.995 --> 26:03.605
All right.

26:03.649 --> 26:06.652
- This is not
a popularity contest.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.610
This is not about who wears
the snazziest suit,

26:08.654 --> 26:10.786
who has the most charisma,

26:10.830 --> 26:12.614
or even who talks the fastest.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.312
It's also not about
how many combat medals

26:15.356 --> 26:17.750
the defendant has.

26:17.793 --> 26:21.536
This is about the facts
and the law.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.972
- I'm not allowed to ask you
to imagine

to be Mickey Davis right now

26:24.844 --> 26:26.672

26:26.715 --> 26:28.543
- I submit to you
that the evidence in this case

26:28.587 --> 26:29.675
is overwhelming.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.154
You will see video of Mr. Davis

26:31.198 --> 26:33.722

Ajay Sharma.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.289
- But I need to know that
you will consider

26:35.332 --> 26:37.508
your decision in this case
as the most important decision

26:37.552 --> 26:39.075
in your life...

26:39.119 --> 26:42.644
because it certainly will be
the most important decision

26:42.688 --> 26:45.604
in the life of
this decorated war hero.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.996
- You will hear testimony

26:47.040 --> 26:48.911
that Mr. Davis is a wounded vet

26:48.955 --> 26:52.045
whose daughter was victimized
by a serial predator.

26:52.088 --> 26:54.482

to not react

is assaulted

in combat?

26:58.442 --> 27:00.009

36:03.204 --> 36:04.814
When I was an ADA,
this would be the moment

36:04.858 --> 36:06.555
I would offer
the defense a deal.

36:06.599 --> 36:07.861
- Man two
is still on the table.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.254
I can recommend the minimum.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.820
- That's exactly the offer
I told Mickey you'd make.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.257
- What did he say?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.302
- Basically, no thank you,
but more anatomically.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.565
- Man two specifically states
that the accused--

36:16.609 --> 36:19.046
- Lacked the intention
to cause harm.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.308
- If I go any lower,
then I'm saying

36:20.352 --> 36:22.267
it's okay for civilians
to take the law

36:22.310 --> 36:24.051
into their own hands.

36:24.094 --> 36:25.531
Rafael, when you were an ADA--

36:25.574 --> 36:27.620
- I would have held the line
at man two.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.926
But here we are.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.885
When I was an ADA,
the NYPD and the DA's office

36:31.928 --> 36:33.713

We already have armed militias
coming into our cities.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.763
How much more lawlessness
can we take?

36:40.807 --> 36:42.504

I agree.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.767
In terms of Davis...

36:44.811 --> 36:46.465
I don't think a jury's gonna
put him in a cell.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.171
- Yeah.

- Let's see if you
learned anything.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.963
My client is in a fight
for his life,

37:07.007 --> 37:09.531

as when he was

37:09.575 --> 37:11.968

in Afghanistan.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.580
He returned home damaged
in body and soul.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.756
And while he was on the long,
hard road to recovery,

37:16.799 --> 37:18.584
his daughter
was being groomed, raped,

37:18.627 --> 37:20.890
and impregnated by Ajay Sharma.

37:20.934 --> 37:24.851
Sharma was a serial predator,

37:24.894 --> 37:28.855

in his home for a decade.

37:37.429 --> 37:41.041

what no one else would do.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.652

to murder Ajay Sharma.

37:57.013 --> 37:58.711
