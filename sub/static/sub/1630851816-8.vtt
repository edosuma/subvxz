WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:46.921
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:47.005 --> 00:47.839
YEAR 1985

00:47.922 --> 00:49.257
Hey, are you heading home?

00:49.340 --> 00:51.009
Yes, sir. See you tomorrow.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.595
Hey, take this with you.

00:53.678 --> 00:54.846
What is it, sir?

00:54.929 --> 00:57.849
It's tree sap water from a painted maple.
My wife brought it.

00:57.932 --> 01:01.478
You moved here with your wife
while she's pregnant.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.897
So that must have been tough.
Especially during her first trimester.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.066
Thank you.

01:06.149 --> 01:10.695
The chief has been telling me
to make sure you're settling in well.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.656
Hey, do you have connections
with the CIA or something?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.410
Hey, I'm just joking.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.412
Here. Gosh. This is heavy.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.414
It's heavy. Oh boy.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.595
You're home.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.890
-What are you doing in the dark?
-Hi.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.935
What's the matter? Did something happen?

01:43.102 --> 01:46.314
-By the way, the captain…
-Honey. Could you sit down for a minute?

01:54.405 --> 01:55.490
What's going on?

01:57.826 --> 02:00.495
Someone came to visit us.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.414
Who? We just moved here.

02:03.998 --> 02:04.874
He's someone

02:05.875 --> 02:07.877
I knew from the One Family Welfare Center.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.088
I was close to him and his sister.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.298
He came over.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.925
Oh, really?

02:14.801 --> 02:17.554
You probably haven't seen him
in years, then.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.098
-Right.
-So why did he come by?

02:24.269 --> 02:26.521
He said he always wondered
how I was doing.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.857
And he knew that I've been living in Seoul

02:28.940 --> 02:30.900
after getting married. Also, he knows that

02:32.235 --> 02:34.028
I had just moved back here.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.116
He then said…

02:41.411 --> 02:42.620
he knew

02:44.205 --> 02:45.373
how much

02:46.916 --> 02:48.585
I despised

02:50.628 --> 02:52.213
my dad.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.718
He knew what my dad had done
at the welfare center

02:56.801 --> 02:59.345
and how I was trying to get as far away

03:01.848 --> 03:03.182
as I could from my dad.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.230
Really?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.152
I don't know what to say.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.448
Why is he bringing that up now?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.075
No.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.119
He mentioned it before.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.080
So you know, Honey.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.460
Can I ask you something?

03:31.377 --> 03:32.545
Promise me

03:34.714 --> 03:36.466
that you'll tell me the truth.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.678
I will.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.805
What's the question?

03:45.850 --> 03:47.810
You really don't remember anything…

03:51.022 --> 03:53.274
after the car accident, right?

03:53.358 --> 03:54.442
What?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.070
What kind of question is that?

03:57.153 --> 04:00.698
You said you can't remember at all
what you did in Seoul.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.704
Can I trust you when you say that?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.054
So her death

04:25.098 --> 04:26.557
wasn't in vain.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.396
She had a baby before she died.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.524
To start

04:35.566 --> 04:36.818
a new life with me

04:37.777 --> 04:39.404
and to usher in a new beginning.

04:42.865 --> 04:43.992
Understand?

04:44.993 --> 04:46.619
It wasn't you.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.206
I was the one she loved in the end.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.077
What the hell is this?

06:46.447 --> 06:48.282
I fell asleep on the couch.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.370
You're not going to bed? It's late.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.704
Go ahead.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.582
All right. I'm going to sleep.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.130
Turn on the lights when you watch TV.
It's bad for your eyes.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.300
Who is that woman?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.699
Geez!

08:25.671 --> 08:27.381
Honey, get inside!

10:00.474 --> 10:02.143
<i>5 MINUTES A DAY, MOTHER'S VOICE</i>

10:39.680 --> 10:40.931
Yes, Captain.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.518
Go ahead. I was already awake.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.604
What?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.190
What do you mean?

10:52.568 --> 10:53.736
Hold on a minute.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.554
This is the house!

11:21.764 --> 11:24.558
-Move!
-I came first!

11:25.142 --> 11:26.227
Can you come out?

11:31.857 --> 11:34.902
Kim Hwan-gyu went straight to the press
and told them you tortured him.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.279
These photos are doctored.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.782
We didn't inflict the injuries
in this photo.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.868
The press isn't putting
pressure on us yet.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.288
But we can't just sweep
this under the rug.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.915
It's not a light matter.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.086
I knew this could happen
when I did what I did.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.090
I could have delayed the article
if I had known about it beforehand.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.967
Seeing how they released it stealthily,

11:58.050 --> 12:01.053
I'm sure Kim Hwan-gyu
couldn't have pulled this off by himself.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.055
Someone has his back.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.351
So take a break for two weeks.
Clear your head.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.812
That's the best course of action.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.067
Can you give me a few more days?
I just met Jo Kyung-ho yesterday.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.235
I can't.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.113
Don't make me fire you.
It can come to that.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.615
You know how serious this is.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.743
He won't stop. There'll be more victims.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.371
You're not making any sense, damn it.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.457
Look at you. You're doing police work.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.127
Why are you taking this so personally?
Why are you going off the rails?

12:41.010 --> 12:44.930
You know what you have to do, right?
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.349
So leave your badge and gun on my desk.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.009
HYUNG-IN. SAJU APT., UNIT 103,
SUITE 704. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

13:25.763 --> 13:28.349
HYUNG-IN. SAJU APT., UNIT 103,
SUITE 704. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

13:31.519 --> 13:32.520
Sir.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.522
You have a guest.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.401
Oh my.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.238
Did you have any trouble
finding my office?

13:45.950 --> 13:48.494
We took that photo
during your farewell ceremony.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.120
You don't remember it, do you?

13:51.580 --> 13:55.668
All the staff members cried that day.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.670
They were sad to see you go.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.215
-That's a lie.
-What?

14:02.216 --> 14:04.635
Everybody knows about
the rampant abuse that went on

14:05.386 --> 14:06.637
at the One Family Welfare Center.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.098
That's a gross misrepresentation.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.684
For political reasons,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.728
a lot of the facts about
the welfare center were misconstrued.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.314
So how were we able to leave the center?

14:17.898 --> 14:19.149
That bastard and me.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.736
Kids weren't allowed to leave
that facility even if they wanted to.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.658
There was a nice married couple
who worked in the cafeteria

14:28.450 --> 14:30.578
at the welfare center.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.831
Unfortunately, they weren't
able to have kids.

14:33.914 --> 14:37.835
They were very fond of you,
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun.

14:38.752 --> 14:42.172
So they said they wanted to adopt you.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.259
That's Ms. Jung Kyung-sook
and her husband.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.679
Thanks to the welfare center,

14:49.346 --> 14:51.932
you were able to meet them,

14:52.016 --> 14:55.561
and have a family of your own.

14:55.644 --> 14:56.937
Not that story.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.775
I'm asking you about the real reason

15:01.859 --> 15:04.111
we were able to escape from the facility.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.089
Oh gosh. This is so sudden.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.468
How did this conversation
take a sudden turn?

15:28.427 --> 15:30.554
I'm the one who invited you here.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.724
How come you're asking
more questions than me, Ms. Jo?

15:33.807 --> 15:34.850
That's odd.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.561
That's not right.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.730
It's completely unfair.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.318
Let's stop wasting time
since we're both busy people.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.738
I'll get straight to the point.
I have a straightforward demand.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.866
Ms. Jo, stop snooping around.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.663
You're tracing past events
after discovering the 1987 magazine issue.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.289
I want you to stop that.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.960
Until I find Jae-young, I won't stop.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.002
You won't?

16:05.631 --> 16:08.759
I knew you would say no.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.263
Speaking of which…

16:14.306 --> 16:16.058
How about this?

16:16.141 --> 16:19.436
I'm willing to
help you find your niece, Ms. Jo.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.567
What are you talking about?

16:26.944 --> 16:27.945
You're…

16:29.071 --> 16:30.531
part of the cult too.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.160
Oh my gosh.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.497
Life isn't so simple, is it?

16:38.580 --> 16:42.209
That's why you're here talking to me.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.503
I'm talking about opening
new opportunities for both of us.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.757
What's going on?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.051
Old lady. Come here.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.430
What happened?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.099
Who are you?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.560
Which department are you from?

16:59.643 --> 17:00.561
Well…

17:02.146 --> 17:03.772
Hello Detective Choi.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.860
The MIU said they were on their way.
You got here fast.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.737
I was in the area,
so I came straight here.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.947
-Can I go in?
-Sure. Go ahead.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.158
-This way.
-How could this happen?

17:24.418 --> 17:27.880
-Did a team sweep the place already?
-No, we're the first to come.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.174
The crime scene is untouched.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.924
Oh my goodness. How terrible.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.428
Oh my goodness.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.645
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

18:33.070 --> 18:35.489
All hell will break loose soon.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.451
These cult members are lunatics.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.579
They're going to commit extreme acts.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.997
What kind of acts?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.793
You understand that
I can't tell you the specifics, right?

18:49.169 --> 18:51.547
But I can tell you this.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.133
The end of the future.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.635
That day is coming.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.472
They'll commit another attack
like the one in 1987.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.350
Only those who are purified

19:03.976 --> 19:05.644
can see that day together.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.402
It's completely crazy.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.864
I can't give you the details about it.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.826
But it's a total waste of time
and energy. Worthless.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.371
So what are you trying to tell me?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.668
So… You need to…

19:31.253 --> 19:34.840
keep your distance
from them and just observe.

19:44.683 --> 19:49.104
I'm upset over the senseless things
they're doing.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.649
I'm sure he would not approve of

19:53.442 --> 19:55.652
what is going on right now in the cult.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.740
So…

20:00.908 --> 20:03.535
I'm planning to flip the script.

20:04.828 --> 20:08.332
And I need your help to do that, Ms. Jo.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.668
I'll keep my promise.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.046
If you agree to cooperate with me,

20:14.713 --> 20:17.883
I'll make sure that
Jae-young is returned to her home.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.885
Do you understand?

20:22.971 --> 20:24.264
How can I trust you?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.610
What is

20:37.861 --> 20:40.864
most important to you right now,
Ms. Jo? Think about that.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.617
Besides that,

20:44.534 --> 20:46.870
nothing else matters to you, right?

20:49.539 --> 20:50.958
Sail that doesn't bend…

20:52.876 --> 20:55.087
break in the storm, you know.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.014
I'm not here to talk about anything else.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.309
You need to know what really happened to
to Associate Professor Kim, don't you?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.561
Please leave.
I don't want to hear it right now.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.022
Professor!

21:14.106 --> 21:15.899
Why are you suddenly being like this?

21:15.983 --> 21:17.776
Do you really have to ask?

21:17.859 --> 21:20.153
I read the article about you
in the morning paper.

21:20.237 --> 21:23.782
How can I continue working with
someone like you?

21:23.865 --> 21:27.369
I'll send the interview files
separately to the precinct.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.787
So please leave.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.937
Why is that car honking?
It's hurting my ears.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.148
I'm getting a massive headache.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.859
And why is General Affairs telling me
to get rid of it?

22:00.068 --> 22:02.279
They don't even know what it is.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.510
Yes? This is Koo Byung-min.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.929
Oh, Dr. Ahn. You're here?

22:28.013 --> 22:31.224
I'll meet you at the parking lot
right away.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.741
-Yes!
-Why didn't you go easy on me?

22:47.824 --> 22:49.451
You lost so no complaining.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.161
Next.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.456
Oh, it's your first day, isn't it?

22:55.248 --> 22:57.459
I like your spirit. Get ready.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.048
Oh, hi. Just a minute.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.222
You're so mean.

23:10.305 --> 23:11.807
Tough luck. You lost.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.142
You're all doing poorly.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.856
The kids sure have a good appetite.

23:19.940 --> 23:24.444
Only a few of them are taking judo classes
because they like it.

23:24.528 --> 23:29.241
Their parents are forcing them
to learn judo. So they're unhappy.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.868
On the day
I'm their substitute instructor,

23:31.952 --> 23:33.620
we always have pizza.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.330
Let's eat fast and get going.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.499
Pig will be here soon too.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.877
-Yong-tak.
-Yes?

23:40.961 --> 23:42.546
How about we don't go there today?

23:43.547 --> 23:45.715
What? Why not?

23:46.842 --> 23:50.011
I'm starting to see things clearer now.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.931
This is my personal matter.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.601
And I need to solve it myself.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.021
I keep having such thoughts.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.482
No way. That's not true.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.527
You only think about yourself, right?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.113
I'm also curious.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.866
I want to see with my own two eyes

24:10.949 --> 24:12.909
what really happened to us.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.037
You think so?

24:17.414 --> 24:19.040
I lost my appetite.

24:19.749 --> 24:20.750
Darn it.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.629
Didn't you say so yourself?

24:24.713 --> 24:26.715
Being completely honest is the best way.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.259
So it's okay to be a nuisance
and stir up some trouble.

24:29.342 --> 24:33.263
You think you're going to get a medal
for going alone?

24:34.264 --> 24:35.348
Darn it.

24:38.518 --> 24:39.936
Eat your pizza, okay?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.340
Let me shake your hand.
It's been a long time.

25:09.674 --> 25:10.842
There's no need for that.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.013
Hey, my arm is starting to hurt.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.605
Do you drink less now?

25:25.398 --> 25:27.234
You're in bad shape.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.778
Have you started to drink again?

25:31.863 --> 25:32.864
No alcohol

25:33.823 --> 25:35.283
has touched my lips lately.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.244
I don't have time to drink either.

25:37.869 --> 25:38.787
That's good to hear.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.957
Ten years have already passed
since those days.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.834
You would come to our church while drunk.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.503
And you told us to open the door.

25:46.586 --> 25:49.130
Once you were inside,
you wouldn't pray though.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.968
You'd just sit in a pew and then leave.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.219
I'm sorry.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.179
It was

25:57.389 --> 25:59.057
so rude of me to act like that.

25:59.975 --> 26:00.809
No.

26:01.476 --> 26:04.312
It wasn't only you. Others acted the same.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.898
I later found out they were the people

26:06.982 --> 26:09.901
who had lost loved ones
in the 1987 attack.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.363
You're going to stay for the night, right?

26:14.864 --> 26:17.659
We still have the room
you used to sleep in.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.911
Oh, I forgot.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.414
We also provide an electric blanket.

26:23.081 --> 26:26.418
And there are more blankets to go around.
It's as cozy as any hotel room.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.964
No, I really can't. I just dropped by.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.090
Don't refuse.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.925
Stay for the night.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.095
It's all right, Hyung-in.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.639
It's okay.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.518
You're here.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.372
This is Dr. Ahn Min-chul.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.876
He works in the psychiatric
department at Saju Hospital.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.545
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.505
Okay. Let's begin.

27:15.258 --> 27:18.219
Could you please answer
this questionnaire?

27:21.222 --> 27:22.682
Dr. Ahn, you can begin.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.436
While you answer the questionnaire,

27:26.519 --> 27:28.938
you can answer the doctor's questions.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.744
Oh gosh. The new prison warden

27:42.827 --> 27:45.288
seems to be very interested
in our sessions.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.584
This will be over very quickly
if you follow the procedure.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.419
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho,

27:52.170 --> 27:55.757
I shall start asking you a few questions.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.969
Are you taking any medication?

28:00.887 --> 28:04.516
Were you administered any antidepressants

28:04.599 --> 28:07.727
or tranquilizers
during your incarceration…

28:10.146 --> 28:13.274
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of your wife's death, isn't it?

28:13.858 --> 28:15.735
Will you be having
a memorial service tomorrow?

28:15.819 --> 28:17.237
Yes, I have to.

28:18.279 --> 28:21.408
It's a gathering of the victims' families
and they look forward to it.

28:21.491 --> 28:24.202
I think it's become
the most important church event we hold.

28:24.285 --> 28:25.995
Well, that's not the case for me

28:26.996 --> 28:28.206
anymore.

28:29.791 --> 28:33.128
I completely forgot that tomorrow
was the day my wife died years ago.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.673
I've been frantically searching
for clues everywhere.

28:36.756 --> 28:39.175
But I screwed it up each time.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.846
There's a person I know

28:43.888 --> 28:45.390
who's been doing that too.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.728
You know Jo Jung-hyun, right?

28:51.438 --> 28:53.398
She recently came to our church.

28:54.774 --> 28:58.903
She asked my congregation to be
merciful and gracious to her family.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.532
But I told Jung-hyun

29:04.033 --> 29:06.911
to please leave this town.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.123
It would be the best for everyone
if she did.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.960
I don't regret saying that to her.

29:15.545 --> 29:18.214
But I can't forget the look on her face

29:19.424 --> 29:21.050
when she looked back at me.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.178
Is that what you meant?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.055
That you’re similar to me?

29:26.681 --> 29:27.640
Oh, come on.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.269
I'm a slightly better person
than you, aren't I?

29:34.606 --> 29:35.523
Hi.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.442
All right.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.069
That's your roommate.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.072
You'll be sharing the room with him.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.285
His parents were members
of my congregation.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.204
They were good people.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.957
According to him,

29:53.041 --> 29:56.669
his parents suddenly began acting weird
after watching some videotape.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.758
His parents are hardly home nowadays.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.095
So he's boarding at our church.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.557
A videotape?

30:17.398 --> 30:20.026
Hey kid. Which drink is the best one?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.570
They all taste bad except
for the chocolate one.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.406
-Pardon?
-Only the chocolate drink is good.

30:25.990 --> 30:26.991
Oh, is that so?

30:32.956 --> 30:34.332
That's a tennis ball.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.334
Did you know that?

30:37.585 --> 30:38.545
It's all right.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.421
Throwing a baseball makes my hand hurt.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.051
How long have you been
using this glove? It's so worn.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.094
No wonder your hands were hurting.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.349
I should've gotten
Job's tears tea instead.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.855
Pastor Woo told me about your parents.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.357
Something happened recently, right?

31:01.818 --> 31:04.863
Could you show me that videotape?

31:06.948 --> 31:09.409
-You said you're a detective.
-Yes, I still am.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.703
If you promise me one thing,
I'll show it to you.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.539
What kind of promise?

31:18.751 --> 31:20.920
That you won't arrest my mom and dad.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.673
They didn't do anything wrong.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.260
Okay. I promise.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.554
Youngjin Brain Study Science.

31:31.097 --> 31:33.474
-What is that?
-That’s what it said on the van.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.352
These people in a van handed the video

31:37.228 --> 31:38.605
to my parents.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.450
When will we visit her?

31:50.533 --> 31:52.660
-Who?
-Min-jae.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.165
I don't know when.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.585
She's the only person
who doesn't share a common denominator.

32:00.668 --> 32:01.753
A common denominator?

32:02.587 --> 32:03.671
What kind?

32:04.255 --> 32:07.634
All of the places we've visited so far
are connected to one person.

32:07.717 --> 32:10.803
Lim In-gwan. I told you about him before.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.724
Right.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.936
That's why he showed up
at that vacation home.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.772
I'm certain that he's deeply
involved with the Youngjin sect.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.399
It's obvious that the sect is bankrolling

32:24.067 --> 32:26.235
his campaign for the local election.

32:26.319 --> 32:29.739
Then shouldn't we be
going after him first?

32:29.822 --> 32:32.241
I'm sure we can find dirt on him.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.705
After what he did to us,
he deserves some payback.

32:39.582 --> 32:40.875
Speaking of which,

32:42.835 --> 32:44.045
I've got something to tell you.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.047
So after we look around the school--

32:46.130 --> 32:49.258
Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.260
But what is in the back?

32:51.344 --> 32:52.512
The back?

32:52.595 --> 32:54.847
What do you mean?
I keep some clothes there.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.476
There seems to be something
moving underneath the clothes.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.854
What are you talking about? Darn.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.526
Oh, Boss. I heard something
moving in the back.

33:13.866 --> 33:16.035
Oh shoot! You scared me.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.746
Oh gosh. I was about to throw a punch.

33:18.830 --> 33:19.747
Moon-sook.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.127
I won't bother you or anything.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.504
Don't be like this.

33:26.587 --> 33:29.298
Aunt, tell him to let me go.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.717
Aunt, please.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.010
Hey, Pig.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.303
Hold onto the kid and stand guard, okay?

33:35.596 --> 33:36.639
Please let me go, Mister.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.559
You're pinching my neck.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.103
-I'll be more careful today.
-My neck!

33:42.186 --> 33:44.480
-I won't even let a mouse get through.
-Okay.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.941
Go and catch mice instead.
Why are you grabbing me?

33:47.025 --> 33:50.319
Did you have to prevent her
from coming along?

33:51.279 --> 33:53.031
She really wants to tag along.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.949
I can't let her get involved.

33:55.616 --> 33:58.119
I think it's best that
only the two of us check it out.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.793
-What?
-I like hearing that.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.129
The two of us.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.012
What were you saying earlier
about having something to tell me?

34:17.597 --> 34:18.890
It's not important.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.517
I'll tell you on our way back.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.204
Mr. Jo.

34:41.287 --> 34:44.624
Were you abused
by your parents while growing up?

34:46.876 --> 34:49.420
Then let's talk about a different period.

34:50.296 --> 34:54.133
How was your time
in the One Family Welfare Center?

34:54.717 --> 34:58.179
Did you experience
abuse or violence there?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.938
This is a very important question.

35:07.021 --> 35:10.274
If it's not too much trouble,
we'd like you to answer that.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.278
You two…

35:17.949 --> 35:20.326
Let me tell you an interesting story.

35:20.409 --> 35:21.410
What?

35:22.453 --> 35:25.331
I've never told anyone this before.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.959
Where I went

35:29.001 --> 35:31.671
on the morning of that day…

35:33.840 --> 35:34.966
What?

35:36.050 --> 35:39.387
That day? Which day is that?

35:40.930 --> 35:43.266
October 6, 1987.

35:44.559 --> 35:47.937
I was wearing a gas mask
inside Saju train station.

35:48.604 --> 35:53.401
<i>People around me were falling down
after inhaling the nerve gas.</i>

35:54.735 --> 35:56.320
<i>Some were vomiting.</i>

35:58.322 --> 35:59.991
<i>I stood there aimlessly</i>

36:01.367 --> 36:03.077
<i>and just watched them.</i>

36:05.746 --> 36:07.290
But all of a sudden,

36:08.749 --> 36:10.918
I started to get mad.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.800
I got so mad that it gave me a headache.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.720
It was hard to contain my anger.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.848
So guess where I went next?

36:23.931 --> 36:24.932
I don't know.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.269
I went to Choi Hyung-in's house.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.647
I went to his house.

36:32.815 --> 36:36.777
I was curious to know
what would happen if I killed him.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.280
I thought it would make my anger subside.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.086
Anyone home?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.756
I don't think my parents are home.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.383
There's nobody home during the day.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.519
This is the room.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.167
My parents thought I wouldn't be able
to find it if they hid it here.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.670
They think I'm a little kid.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.510
Let's take this outside.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.846
-Your parents might come in at any minute.
-No.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.016
They watch it every day
after they come home.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.226
If they find out it's missing,

37:50.309 --> 37:52.728
they'll probably come looking
for me at church and create a scene.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.399
Oh, wait a minute.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.278
Our VCR player is pretty old.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.370
You have to blow on it first.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.418
When I arrived at Choi Hyung-in's house,

38:16.711 --> 38:20.006
his place felt like one, big coffin.

38:21.882 --> 38:24.260
It was dark and cold.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.429
And it was a lonely house.

38:27.888 --> 38:31.475
Still wearing my gas mask,
I went inside slowly

38:32.059 --> 38:34.228
without taking off my shoes.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.233
There were a couple of small bedrooms.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.402
In one room,

38:41.485 --> 38:44.697
I could hear a dog scratching the door.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.285
I had seen his dog before.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.081
I went straight to the master bedroom.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.043
<i>The door was open</i>

38:57.126 --> 38:59.795
<i>and I could see him sleeping in bed.</i>

39:00.880 --> 39:02.965
<i>He reeked of alcohol.</i>

39:03.049 --> 39:05.801
<i>He hadn't changed his clothes.</i>

39:05.885 --> 39:08.387
It seemed like he had fallen asleep
after getting home.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.849
I hovered over him

39:12.850 --> 39:15.019
and looked down at his face.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.300
I don't think you should watch it.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.677
Why not? Can't I see it too?

39:49.804 --> 39:50.763
Oh gosh.

39:52.139 --> 39:55.684
Can I stay in the room then?
I won't watch it.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.855
I'll stay under the blanket.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.357
Please.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.528
All right.

40:06.779 --> 40:10.408
You have to promise never to watch it.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.618
Okay.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.286
Go over there.

41:13.679 --> 41:16.265
Hey. Who are you?

41:17.516 --> 41:19.602
What the hell are you doing in my house?

41:19.685 --> 41:20.644
You bastard.

41:20.728 --> 41:21.896
You piece of shit.

41:27.526 --> 41:29.111
Dad. Don't.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.738
I brought him here.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.450
Dad, stop it. Don't hurt him.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.286
-Don't.
-Let go of me, boy!

42:02.019 --> 42:03.354
I'm Jo Kyung-ho.

42:04.271 --> 42:06.398
That's my name. Jo Kyung-ho.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.207
Mister, stop it.

42:23.290 --> 42:25.584
You're going to kill my dad. Please stop.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.841
Let's leave this place.

42:39.223 --> 42:43.310
You're all
going to be dead tomorrow, anyway.

42:43.394 --> 42:47.815
Han-gyu! And you too, Mister.

42:47.898 --> 42:51.360
You're all going to die tomorrow.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.112
Understand, fools!

42:57.700 --> 42:58.701
Don't worry.

42:58.784 --> 43:00.494
Nothing like that is going to happen.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.704
Trust me.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.789
You have to trust me.

43:08.794 --> 43:10.588
Then it crossed my mind.

43:12.673 --> 43:16.010
Maybe I shouldn't kill Choi Hyung-in.

43:16.093 --> 43:17.595
Why?

43:21.557 --> 43:22.725
Just because.

43:24.143 --> 43:27.271
When I saw him,
he suddenly looked so pathetic.

43:32.359 --> 43:33.902
Could you close the window?

43:37.197 --> 43:38.115
What?

43:38.782 --> 43:39.992
I'm asking you…

43:41.493 --> 43:43.287
to close the window.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.164
Hey, Mr. Jo.

43:54.715 --> 43:58.052
When I decided not to kill Choi Hyung-in,

43:59.345 --> 44:01.430
I was able to see

44:01.513 --> 44:03.474
the beginning

44:06.477 --> 44:08.145
as well as the end of everything.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.274
Do you know what that means?

44:15.986 --> 44:17.529
While you people

44:18.155 --> 44:21.367
follow a straight line
in your stream of consciousness,

44:22.034 --> 44:23.535
I'm different.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.413
My consciousness

44:28.832 --> 44:31.710
is in a loop that spreads everywhere.

44:32.294 --> 44:33.337
So…

44:34.380 --> 44:37.049
while you keep going forward,

44:38.550 --> 44:41.261
I'm stuck in a loop

44:42.763 --> 44:44.598
where I can see everything.

44:45.182 --> 44:49.019
That allows me to see the beginning

44:52.481 --> 44:54.483
and the end and everything in between.

45:09.915 --> 45:13.210
But it's being ruined by people
who don't know anything.

45:13.919 --> 45:16.588
Foolishly believing
they can make a difference.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.970
They're acting however they like.

45:29.685 --> 45:32.563
Was it 1987 when we came here

45:32.646 --> 45:35.357
-with all the magazine club members?
-Yes.

45:37.359 --> 45:40.696
That means this place
has been abandoned for over ten years.

45:40.779 --> 45:42.239
How is that possible?

45:43.490 --> 45:45.284
I think they wanted to keep it around.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.787
Keep it around? Who?

45:49.371 --> 45:51.957
The people who wanted
the secret spots to be kept intact.

45:52.541 --> 45:56.044
So this place is also connected
to that Lim In-gwan guy?

45:56.670 --> 46:00.466
Yes. His daughter went to this school.
Her name was Lim Se-yoon.

46:25.908 --> 46:28.494
It'll be all right. You can trust me.

46:30.037 --> 46:31.079
Okay.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.650
These guys do such creepy stuff.

47:27.594 --> 47:28.845
What is this?

47:30.138 --> 47:31.306
Yong-tak.

47:31.848 --> 47:32.849
Look at this.

47:39.773 --> 47:40.816
What is it?

47:45.279 --> 47:47.239
Why is a photo of us hanging there?

47:52.744 --> 47:54.496
Why do our faces look like that?

48:11.805 --> 48:15.017
Yong-tak. There's a candle.
That was lit not too long ago.

48:15.100 --> 48:16.852
There could be someone else here.

48:27.696 --> 48:29.281
Let's get out of here right now.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.248
Pig.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.626
Hey Pig. Can't you hear me?

48:41.960 --> 48:44.838
-Oh damn it. He's outside.
-I don't have any reception.

48:47.174 --> 48:49.259
This is maddening. Damn it.

48:49.343 --> 48:51.011
Let's find another way out.

49:00.395 --> 49:03.482
I guess these bastards
aren't showing up today.

49:04.232 --> 49:07.194
I wanted to get revenge
for what they did to us last time.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.367
I think we can climb out
through that window.

49:49.319 --> 49:50.487
Yong-tak!

49:59.788 --> 50:01.415
We have to get out of here fast.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.668
Go first.

50:04.751 --> 50:06.837
No. You go first.

50:19.725 --> 50:20.726
Yong-tak.

50:21.309 --> 50:22.519
Climb out now. Hurry!

50:29.067 --> 50:30.152
Yong-tak.

50:34.281 --> 50:35.449
What are you doing?

50:37.576 --> 50:38.994
Over there…

50:40.454 --> 50:41.830
Do you see…

50:43.999 --> 50:45.375
over there?

50:47.169 --> 50:49.045
Do you see that woman standing there?

50:51.423 --> 50:52.507
What?

50:58.138 --> 51:01.099
She's been staring at us this whole time.

51:01.892 --> 51:03.852
What are you talking about?
There's nobody there.

51:05.061 --> 51:06.563
You don't see her?

51:09.941 --> 51:12.652
Come out first. Okay?
Let's talk about it after you get out.

51:14.988 --> 51:16.281
Something…

51:17.741 --> 51:19.326
has come over me.

51:20.285 --> 51:22.245
You're starting to look like

51:23.663 --> 51:25.123
that woman over there.

51:26.333 --> 51:27.334
What?

51:30.796 --> 51:33.089
If I climb out of here,

51:33.173 --> 51:35.133
I think I might kill you.

51:37.052 --> 51:38.678
What are you talking about?

51:40.263 --> 51:41.765
Give me your hand, Yong-tak.

51:45.018 --> 51:46.937
Get away from me!

51:47.020 --> 51:48.021
Get away!

51:54.653 --> 51:57.197
Don't even think about it!
Stay right there!

51:57.280 --> 52:00.033
The minute you come down here,
I'll kill you!

52:01.326 --> 52:02.577
I'm not joking.

52:03.161 --> 52:04.621
I'll really kill you.

52:05.622 --> 52:06.706
Yong-tak.

52:07.833 --> 52:09.543
Why are you being like this?

52:16.174 --> 52:17.217
Jung-hyun.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.386
Jung-hyun.

52:45.787 --> 52:47.581
I was lying to you.

52:48.415 --> 52:51.251
I've resented you for so long.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.546
When I heard that

52:55.297 --> 52:57.382
you had moved back to our town,

53:00.552 --> 53:02.345
I thought…

53:05.098 --> 53:07.475
I'd be able to bump into you
in the street someday.

53:08.476 --> 53:10.228
That gave me such hope.

53:10.979 --> 53:13.315
Like how I felt
during our high school days.

53:19.321 --> 53:20.780
So I'm so sad, Jung-hyun.

53:21.656 --> 53:25.160
Damn it.
Why didn't I tell you this sooner?

53:28.163 --> 53:29.664
Don't do this to me, Yong-tak.

53:31.958 --> 53:33.585
Please don't…

53:35.670 --> 53:36.963
It's all right.

53:37.589 --> 53:39.257
I have no regrets.

53:41.968 --> 53:42.928
You…

53:45.597 --> 53:46.932
You know, right?

54:14.292 --> 54:15.877
Aunt!

54:15.961 --> 54:17.963
No! Aunt!

54:18.046 --> 54:19.798
You'll die if you go in there.

54:19.881 --> 54:21.049
Let go of me!

54:22.258 --> 54:24.386
-Yong-tak!
-Aunt!

55:51.181 --> 55:55.226
I couldn't understand it at first
when I saw his power.

55:55.310 --> 55:57.979
I later realized how foolish I was.

55:58.563 --> 56:00.982
You just need to believe.

56:02.150 --> 56:05.945
He's entered our minds and bodies.

56:08.698 --> 56:09.657
Professor Koo…

56:10.158 --> 56:11.493
I feel like

56:12.827 --> 56:14.662
I've been reborn.

56:15.622 --> 56:16.748
I know, right?

56:17.582 --> 56:19.000
It's a good thing.

56:19.834 --> 56:21.169
Very nice.

56:21.878 --> 56:22.962
Thank you.

56:23.797 --> 56:25.882
Thank you so much.

56:36.392 --> 56:38.728
I heard what happened. Are you okay?

56:38.812 --> 56:40.522
Yes, I'm all right.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.565
Please look after the boy.

56:44.609 --> 56:45.568
Are you leaving?

56:46.736 --> 56:48.321
I have to go and find something.

56:51.491 --> 56:53.118
You'll be back, won't you?

56:56.955 --> 56:59.040
Yes. I promise.

57:22.564 --> 57:23.481
Yes, Captain.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.650
<i>Go to the driving range
next to Cheonyang Lake.</i>

57:25.733 --> 57:27.110
-<i>They're there.</i>
-Okay.

57:44.711 --> 57:45.837
Oh, okay.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.423
Is it all ready?

57:50.300 --> 57:51.301
Okay.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.554
Guru will talk to you directly.

57:56.264 --> 57:58.725
Don't forget that
your role is very important.

57:58.808 --> 58:00.935
And did you take care of them?

58:01.019 --> 58:02.645
Jo Jung-hyun and Kang Yong-tak.

58:04.105 --> 58:06.608
I see. So that's how it went down.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.787
Repeat what you told me.
What happened to them?

58:20.580 --> 58:23.082
<i>Yong-tak died at the scene.</i>

58:23.666 --> 58:26.211
<i>Jung-hyun was able to escape.</i>

58:28.379 --> 58:29.631
I got it.

58:35.220 --> 58:36.846
We're the only ones left now.

58:38.932 --> 58:40.016
Min-jae.

58:43.770 --> 58:44.729
Yes.

58:45.855 --> 58:47.273
It's just us.

58:50.985 --> 58:54.447
I'll try to take care of this
without making any mistakes.

58:55.990 --> 58:56.991
Yes.

58:57.492 --> 58:59.077
In a little while,

58:59.786 --> 59:01.704
Detective Choi will be here.

59:01.788 --> 59:04.040
And we'll have to begin that
when he gets here.

59:13.174 --> 59:15.176

October 6, 1987.

59:29.357 --> 59:31.234
A day of purification.

59:32.026 --> 59:34.821
Now we'll usher in a new dawn.

59:34.904 --> 59:36.781
A new millennium.
