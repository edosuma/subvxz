WEBVTT

03:14.194 --> 03:17.312
Whoa! No, oh, no.

03:17.614 --> 03:23.076
Tax fraud? Oh, no. I mean,
this is a miscalculation.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.032
Yes, I mean,
a misunderstanding

03:25.330 --> 03:27.538
certainly, but, you know,
I would even go so far

03:27.833 --> 03:29.495
as to admit that
it was bad judgment.

03:29.793 --> 03:30.954
It could be
really bad judgment,

03:31.253 --> 03:33.461
but it's certainly not tax
fraud. No, I don't think so.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.168
Look. We need to meet
with you and your client

03:36.466 --> 03:38.128
at his office
tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.923
All right, all right,
we'll be there. 10 o'clock.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.632
Good. Otherwise,
warrants get issued.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.136
Property gets attached.
Everyone gets very cranky.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.891
Well,

03:51.189 --> 03:54.148
we don't want cranky,
do we? (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

03:54.568 --> 03:56.309
No, we don't.

03:59.072 --> 04:03.908
Sleep well, Mr. Lachman.
We'll see you tomorrow. 10 o'clock.

05:03.094 --> 05:06.633
- Thank you.
- Well, this is our big night.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.562
- Yes, it is.
- You work the girls

05:09.632 --> 05:10.642
and I'll work the boys.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.053
Sounds great. See you soon.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.436
- Not soon enough.
- Aw.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.902
- Love, love, love.
- Oh, Caroline.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.237
BOTH: Mwah. Mwah.
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:24.533 --> 05:25.239
Oh, Caroline.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.945
What a fabulous look,
as usual.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.203
- Oh, thank you.
- 10 years! Can you believe it?

05:30.622 --> 05:33.615
Well, it's easy to believe, it's
just a little tough to admit.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.034
Well, I'm just glad
someone's happily married,

05:36.336 --> 05:37.702
even if it isn't moi.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.120
Oh, honey.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.584
I still can't believe you
haven't traded in Brad

05:41.883 --> 05:43.749
for one of those hot new models.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.216
Oh, sweetheart, you never
trade in a classic.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.889
- Oh, meow.
- Oh.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.391
- They're so happy.
- I'm so jealous.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.847
(GUESTS LAUGHING)

05:54.521 --> 05:55.728
Now imagine, if you will,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.639
a Mecca where people
from all over the world

05:58.942 --> 06:02.777
can partake in
a celebration of miracles.

06:04.155 --> 06:09.401
We will lift their souls while
we lighten their wallets.

(ALL LAUGHING)

by God himself.

(ALL LAUGHING)

06:36.229 --> 06:39.643
Brad, darling,
look who I found.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.525
Your Honor, it's a thrill
to have you here.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.356
Well, it's a pleasure
to be here.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.897
Thank you.
And my favorite attorney.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.737
- I owe you one, buddy.
- Hmm. You sure do.

06:51.036 --> 06:51.901
(SOFTLY EXCLAIMS IN SURPRISE)

06:52.621 --> 06:54.112
All right.
May I continue?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.844
Let me take you on a journey.

06:55.914 --> 06:57.407
- Step this way.
- Please, go ahead.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.703
All right. Now, welcome
to the Holy Land.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.288
Check it out.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.047
"Bedouin Breakfast."
Come on, you gotta love it.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.669
What is this? A sell job
or an anniversary party?

07:09.220 --> 07:12.133
For our Jewish guests, "Torah,
Torah, Torah, the Water Slide."

07:12.432 --> 07:13.422
And for our Japanese guests,

07:13.725 --> 07:15.557
"Tora, Tora, Tora,
the Water Slide."

07:15.852 --> 07:17.093
(EXCLAIMS IN DELIGHT)

07:17.395 --> 07:20.138
Look, "Water Into Winery." And
what a great year for wine.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.851
Mmm! One.

07:22.943 --> 07:27.187
My favorite attraction. Here
it is, "The Burning Bush."

Mr. Sexton.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.125
Not only have you
no respect for religion,

07:49.427 --> 07:52.636
but you have ruined
my favorite Balenciaga.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.390
I can assure you that if you
go ahead with this heresy,

07:56.685 --> 07:59.678
you and anyone else stupid
enough to get involved

07:59.980 --> 08:02.267

having dessert tonight?

Yo, Picasso!
Let's go!

08:38.809 --> 08:39.799
Ugh.

I don't know

how I'll ever be able
to face my friends again.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.878
You're so funny, honey.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.755
Actually, I'll just
confess to them

09:18.058 --> 09:20.675
that I'm married to a moron
and that way they'll feel

09:20.977 --> 09:22.809
sorry for me, and then
they'll forgive me.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.892
Well, this moron built
you this fabulous life.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.810
Oh, that again! Oh, I forgot!
That's right, honey.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.229
You did everything,
and I did nothing.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.193
Well, I have developed

09:35.492 --> 09:37.700
16 commercial properties in the
last five years,

09:37.994 --> 09:40.361
including Euro Alcatraz.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.574
(SCOFFS)

09:41.873 --> 09:44.832
I'm sorry. Did you say,
"Euro Alcatraz"?

09:45.502 --> 09:50.463
"Vacation in the Big House."
Say, did you hear that?

09:50.757 --> 09:51.713
What?

09:51.783 --> 09:55.509
The sound of an entire continent
laughing at you. (CHUCKLES)

09:56.179 --> 09:59.297
Ouch. Caroline, refresh my
memory, will you, please?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.512
What exactly have you done
in the past five years?

10:02.811 --> 10:04.552
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, I know.

10:04.854 --> 10:09.224
You've done Bloomingdale's. You've
done lunch. You've done Chemical peels.

10:09.526 --> 10:14.942
You've done collagen. You've done
liposuction. (SUCKING SOUND) Wow.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.732
You poor, deluded
little monkey.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.784
Who do you think brought you
to those people, hmm?

10:21.329 --> 10:23.742
Without me, Brad,
you would be nothing.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.619
(COUGHS)

10:29.671 --> 10:33.961
I beg your pardon, but I had a very successful
real estate career before I ever met you.

10:34.259 --> 10:40.722
Oh, really? So you consider leasing
parking spaces a real estate career?

10:41.015 --> 10:44.725
Well, here's a news flash, Brad.
I took you from Kmart to Tiffany's.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.844
I invented you.

10:47.397 --> 10:51.186
Okay. Then I guess you have no
one else to blame but yourself.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.818
That's... I guess not.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.735
Good night.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.001
(INTERCOM BEEPS)

11:11.071 --> 11:13.709
CAROLINE: Say, Brad, darling, here's a
thought. Since you're so good with fire,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.875
why not set up a little
barbecue barrel down on 42nd

11:17.177 --> 11:19.635
and sell flame-broiled
pigeons?

11:19.929 --> 11:22.967
Or maybe you should write a cookbook,
How to Roast Your Own Nuts?

11:23.266 --> 11:24.256
What do you think, Brad?

11:24.559 --> 11:26.425
<i>Jumping catfish!
You'd drive a guy crazy!</i>

11:26.728 --> 11:30.813
You know what I think? I think I'm tired
of busting my ass while you sit around in

11:31.107 --> 11:34.225
your ever-widening one
criticizing everything I do.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.936
Oh, really? I spent
the last six months

11:37.238 --> 11:39.525
busting this ever-widening
ass, and for what?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.942
So that you could take our anniversary
and turn it into some carny sideshow

11:43.244 --> 11:44.701
to promote
some lame idea?

11:44.996 --> 11:47.830
All right, Caroline.
What is this really about?

11:48.124 --> 11:52.084
Nothing, Brad. Just another thrilling
Saturday night at the Sextons'.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.837
(GRUNTS) Are you really that pissed off
about that little incident at the party?

11:56.132 --> 11:59.341
No. I am pissed because if had
just stayed in fashion design

11:59.636 --> 12:01.548
instead of wasting
my time on you,

12:01.846 --> 12:04.213
I would probably have my
own collection by now.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.850
Ah, so instead you're collecting
everyone else's collection.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.314
Don't you get it?
I gave it up to help you.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.770
Oh, please. You gave it up
because you were afraid

12:16.069 --> 12:17.685
you might actually
have to finish something.

12:23.785 --> 12:24.992
I'm tired.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.656
Then go to bed.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.072
No. Of this.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.660
What used to work in this
marriage just doesn't work anymore.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.495
Uh-oh. Oh, God, here it comes,
the divorce talk again.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.960
Brad, we're both wasting
our time. What's the point?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.001
If you want out,
just say the word.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.302
(SOFTLY) Out.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.175
What?

12:46.933 --> 12:47.844
Out!

12:48.060 --> 12:50.551
- You want a divorce?
- I need a divorce!

12:50.853 --> 12:53.391
You got it. Good! And
we'll split everything!

12:53.690 --> 12:56.854
Wait a minute. Split what? We don't
own any of this shit around here.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.859
All we have is debt. And I'd be
glad to split that with you, 50-50.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.737
50-50?
Not on your life!

13:03.032 --> 13:05.866
- Then it'll get ugly.
- Good! I can do ugly.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.531
I've done you for
the last ten years!

13:10.540 --> 13:13.874
As memory serves me, you stopped
doing me after six and a half.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.204
Happy anniversary, honey.

13:15.274 --> 13:17.369
- Fuck off!
- Okay.

distasteful to you, you can leave.</i>

anytime you see fit.</i>

<i>Nobody's holding you here.</i>

13:53.166 --> 13:54.623
<i>I can get along.</i>

14:11.100 --> 14:12.181
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

14:14.687 --> 14:15.973
- Morning, guys.
- BOTH: Mr. Sexton.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.352
Good morning, Penny.

14:20.422 --> 14:22.352
- Well, did it come?
- Just arrived.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.612
All fixed.
That'll be $96.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.648
- I'll owe you, okay?
- I can't.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.697
Not this time.
And I'll need cash.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.829
Really?

14:34.123 --> 14:36.957
- Really!
- Okay.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.251
I'll go to the bank today.
You'll get your cash.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.039
Have I ever shown you
the back of this?

14:43.109 --> 14:47.506
Yes, you've shown it to me many
times. Oh, your new chair is here.

14:47.804 --> 14:48.885
Is it?

14:51.641 --> 14:54.805
- Ow! Bob!
- (STAMMERING) Brad.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.720
What are you doing? Where are
you going with all that stuff?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.513
I'm not going anywhere.
This is nothing.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.058
I am going someplace,
you know, but I've got to...

15:02.360 --> 15:04.101
Put a hold on it. There's something
I want to talk to you about.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.443
I would love to, you know,

15:05.513 --> 15:07.943
- but I've got...
- Bob... Bob.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.867
- I've got your number.
- Huh?

15:19.544 --> 15:20.660
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>Number, please?</i>

15:20.962 --> 15:23.249
New satellite phone
from Osaka. Huh?

15:23.548 --> 15:26.131
Got your number right in there. This
thing will pick up a signal anywhere.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.908
That's great,
but I gotta go.

15:27.978 --> 15:31.511
Wait, wait, wait! I got one more thing
to show you. Please? Just take a minute.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.470
Oh, by the way, Bob. How'd that IRS
thing come out? Are we gonna survive?

15:35.852 --> 15:38.265
(STAMMERING) Sure, I
took care of everything.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.725
That's what
I want to hear.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.565
What do you think? The Shiatsu 2000
Massage Experience.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.400
That's fantastic.
I gotta go.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.656
Wait a minute! Come on,
Bob, look at this.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.911
Oh, feeling good. I got the
manicure-pedicure option,

15:55.981 --> 16:00.040
and I can sit here while I'm getting
my back rubbed, I can get a facial, too.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.745
- What do you think?
- I'll tell you what I think.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.162
I think that you are spending
development money on stupid toys.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.799
These are not stupid toys.
These are business tools.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.343
I write all this stuff off.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.261
Yeah, that's what I do.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.802
I could do a lot more. I got a working
knowledge of every inch of this place.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.390
I got... I got...

16:21.689 --> 16:23.726
I gotta go.
I'm really late.

16:24.066 --> 16:28.060
Hold on! I'll walk out with you.
There's something else I should tell you.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.065
Great.

- Come on, come on, come on.

32:50.719 --> 32:51.835
I need a place to stay.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.254
No can do, my friend. That
would be abetting a felon.

32:54.556 --> 32:57.390
Phil, you abet felons every day.
You play racquetball with them.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.142
Bradley, you know
I would love to help you.

33:00.479 --> 33:04.143
Call Lachman. Find him. He's the
one responsible for this mess.

33:04.441 --> 33:05.431
Let me get him on
the other line.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.693
- I'm gonna put you on hold.
- <i>Don't put me on...</i> Shit!

33:08.987 --> 33:11.695
Suppers at the Yoder house won't
be the same without you two.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.447
The cousins'll be moving
here soon enough.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.358
They're from an Ordnung
in Missouri.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.783
PHIL: <i>Brad, you still there?</i>

33:17.078 --> 33:18.694
Yeah, yeah, where else
would I go, Phil?

33:19.164 --> 33:21.622
Seems like our friend Bob's
phone has been disconnected.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.492
What? That dirty
son of a...

33:24.961 --> 33:28.295
Calm down. Now both of you lie
low, let me survey the landscape.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.252
Check back with me
in a day or two.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.540
Or two?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.051
Tax fraud, resisting arrest,
grand theft auto?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.258
Bradley, my boy,
what were you thinking?

33:36.556 --> 33:38.923
- I was thinking about saving my ass!
- (WOMAN GASPS)

33:40.685 --> 33:43.769
Because that donkey's been
in the family for years.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.023
And we couldn't live without it.
Save it. Any cost. Thanks, bye.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.105
I just love that donkey.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.321
Ow!

34:00.330 --> 34:03.038
MAN 1: The cousins, will they make
it in time for our planting season?

34:03.108 --> 34:05.996
MAN 2: Hard to say. Could
be a month, maybe two.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.081
- Too bad for Samuel.
- Hmm.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.668
Well, do you have everything?
Yeah? Good. God be with you.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.958
MAN 2: Thank you
for your help.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.719
MAN 1: My pleasure. Maybe you'll
come and see us in Michigan.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.469
- (WHISTLING)
- Maybe, maybe...

34:23.353 --> 34:25.891
BRAD: Listen, the real cousins
won't be here for a month.

34:26.188 --> 34:28.306
We're not gonna get away
with it. We'll get caught.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.271
One night, two nights, tops, here till
I get Phil to pull some strings for us.

34:31.570 --> 34:35.029
It'll work, but you might want
to tuck those bad boys in.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.360
You look like
a Shakespearean whore.

34:37.659 --> 34:41.197
These bad boys cost me $14,000.
I'm not tucking them in.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.987
Well, these people...
Fourteen grand for the set?

34:44.291 --> 34:46.578
I can't look
this good for free.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.994
(SCOFFS) Fine. You know what? If
you paid a little bit more attention

34:50.297 --> 34:53.085
to our finances, maybe we
wouldn't even be in this mess.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.216
That's it. Yoder.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.047
They've all said "Yoder."

34:58.346 --> 35:01.839
This is it. It's got to be. It's
so picturesque. It's almost serene.

35:02.142 --> 35:05.886
Look at this. I can almost
imagine Planet Amishwood.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.723
- (LAUGHING)
- Shut up, Brad!

35:08.023 --> 35:09.639
I just want to
get this sham over with.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.274
All I want is a hot bath
and a cozy bed.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.231
No kidding. All right,
here's the deal.

35:14.529 --> 35:15.440
Follow my lead,
I'll do the talking.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.947
I know all we need to
know about being Amish.

35:18.241 --> 35:18.947
Since when?

35:19.242 --> 35:21.029
Since I saw Witness.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.570
- Tiffany earrings, dead giveaway, honey.
- No!

35:24.706 --> 35:26.638
- And the lipstick.
- What?

35:26.708 --> 35:28.700
- Use my sleeve. Come on.
- All of it?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.377
- Guess what, Brad?
- Hmm.

35:32.672 --> 35:36.006
I saw Witness, too, and they
didn't wear Armani shades.

35:41.806 --> 35:45.220
The rings. Amish don't
wear wedding rings.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.853
Okay, fine, take them.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.690
I wasn't planning on wearing
them very much longer anyway.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.692
Okay. All we gotta do is pretend
to be people that we're not

36:02.994 --> 36:05.577
to fool people we don't
know in a situation

36:05.872 --> 36:10.617
we've never been in. We're from
New York, how hard can it be?

36:10.919 --> 36:12.000
(SIGHS)
Let's go.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.499
(GROANS)

36:17.175 --> 36:18.586
Caroline, come on.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.635
God, you look like
an idiot in that suit.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.125
(BARKING)

37:10.812 --> 37:13.020
(GASPS)
Buzz off, Lassie.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.146
SAMUEL: Samson, down!

37:19.237 --> 37:20.193
Mr. Yoder?

37:20.488 --> 37:22.150
Yeah?
How may we help you?

37:22.490 --> 37:24.026
We're the cousins.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.736
- Cousins?
- Your cousins.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.776
- Your kin?
- From Missouri.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.031
- Emma?
- Emma?

37:32.333 --> 37:34.074
- Jacob?
- Jacob.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.289
- Jacob and Emma.
- Yoder.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.288
We weren't expecting
you for months.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.754
BOTH: Surprise!

37:43.511 --> 37:46.128
- Well, what happened to you?
- Ugh. It's hard to say.

37:47.557 --> 37:52.769
We had a carriage accident
up by the pond

37:53.062 --> 37:54.473
- about six miles back.
- Danker's pond.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.891
Danker's pond. And the horse,
I looked one way, he saw...

37:58.193 --> 38:01.527
- Snakes.
- And spooked him, and he tore off...

38:01.821 --> 38:04.063
- Drowned.
- Tore off and drowned.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.778
And the carriage flipped, and at
the bottom of the pond there are

38:07.076 --> 38:09.693
pieces of the carriage. Oh, it's
been in the family for years.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.497
Children, this is our cousins.
This is Jacob and Emma.

38:13.792 --> 38:14.623
Yoder.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.910
This is our eldest,
Rebecca. Anna.

38:17.212 --> 38:18.043
Hello. Hi.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.294
Sam Junior.

38:20.799 --> 38:25.510
Would you think it rude or
unkind if maybe I went in

38:25.804 --> 38:27.045
and just washed up
a little?

38:27.347 --> 38:28.588
Of course, please,
come this way.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.882
Hey, thank you, boys.

38:31.184 --> 38:33.016
It's sure good to be... here.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.302
Welcome.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.272
Here we go.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.489
Everything you need
you'll find in the dresser.

38:50.787 --> 38:54.280
- Blankets, some clothes that fit.
- (CHUCKLES)

38:54.958 --> 38:57.120
And the outhouse
is right out back.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.087
I'm sure you want a few minutes
to pray before dinner.

39:02.382 --> 39:05.090
Grandma Yoder is preparing
one of her special meals.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.674
You know, this is so swell.
And your phone is...?

39:08.972 --> 39:12.306
(GASPS) My. You must come
from a liberal Ordnung.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.513
Yes, a very liberal Ordnung.

39:15.812 --> 39:19.226
Ours is one of the last remaining
old order Amish communities

39:19.524 --> 39:23.143
in the country. We still do not
receive any electricity or public works.

39:23.444 --> 39:24.980
(GRUNTS)

39:25.150 --> 39:27.647
We like to maintain our purity and
independence from the government.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.614
Don't we all?

39:30.201 --> 39:33.660
We find it best to remain
disconnected from the outside world,

39:33.955 --> 39:36.618
where corruption and materialism
are so common place.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.999
Amen to that, sister.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.501
I'm so relieved
you're here, Emma.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.460
This time of year, heaven knows
we could really use the extra help.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.958
Welcome.

39:49.470 --> 39:53.635
Extra help? No, no, no,
I can't stay here.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.094
They don't have television

39:55.393 --> 39:57.476
and they don't even have indoor
plumbing, for God's sakes.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.887
What did you expect?
Room service and a Jacuzzi?

40:00.189 --> 40:01.851
It's either this,
or sleeping on cow pies.

40:02.150 --> 40:02.981
Great!

40:03.276 --> 40:05.188
Cow dung or Ordung.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.729
Ordnung. Ordnung.
Learn it.

40:09.782 --> 40:12.650
- Thank God we're from a liberal one.
- Thank God.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.201
Why is that, Brad?

40:14.495 --> 40:17.784
So when you blow it by acting
like Marie Antoinette,

40:19.292 --> 40:22.660
we can blame it on our Ordnung.
Gee, this bed is awfully small.

40:22.962 --> 40:23.952
BOTH: Hmm.

40:24.631 --> 40:25.997
Well, you know what, Brad?

40:26.299 --> 40:28.632
You don't need to worry about
that, because in our Ordnung,

40:29.010 --> 40:29.921
(CLATTERS)

40:30.219 --> 40:31.710
the men sleep on the floor!

40:33.097 --> 40:34.133
Ugh!

40:34.933 --> 40:35.844
What?

40:36.142 --> 40:37.223
- I need a smoke!
- (YELPS)

40:54.410 --> 40:55.400
Yeah.

41:06.130 --> 41:11.546
Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.348
- Amen.
- Amen.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.725
What's wrong, Emma?

41:21.145 --> 41:22.431
Oh, just anxious.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.471
You don't know how long it's
been since I had my last...

41:24.541 --> 41:30.611
Emma is just nervous. She's a little
shy when she's around new people.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.573
Don't be shy, Emma. We're
not new people. We're cousins.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.408
What happened to your beard?

41:36.703 --> 41:37.489
Hmm?

41:37.787 --> 41:39.528
Keep to your own, Sammy.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.948
Forgive him,
but in our Ordnung,

41:42.250 --> 41:44.412
only the unmarried men
go without beards.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.455
In all Ordnungs.

41:46.754 --> 41:47.961
Sam Junior,
now don't be prideful.

41:48.256 --> 41:51.294
He has a point. And there's
an explanation for it.

41:51.592 --> 41:54.630
A while back
in our Ordnung, we had...

41:54.929 --> 41:56.761
- Outbreak.
- Yes, we had an outbreak.

41:57.056 --> 41:58.263
- And it was...
- Lice.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.139
(SOFTLY) Lice?

42:00.435 --> 42:02.677
- Mmm.
- But it only lasted

42:02.979 --> 42:05.392
- a very short time.
- Minute Lice.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.029
Jacob, you must be very
anxious to meet Big John.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.324
Of course I am.
How is Big John?

42:17.994 --> 42:20.156
Ah. (CHUCKLES)
Belgians.

42:20.830 --> 42:21.946
(LAUGHS)

42:22.708 --> 42:25.324
I tried some of your suggestions,
but he just wouldn't listen.

42:25.626 --> 42:29.040
Do they ever? Belgians are
only good for two things.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.079
Waffles and
deep, dark chocolates.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.876
(WHISTLES)

42:36.929 --> 42:39.797
Grandma, if you don't mind, I'm
just gonna go with a salad.

42:42.060 --> 42:46.304
Or, better yet, I'll just
eat this enormous wiener.

42:53.237 --> 42:55.820
I'm gonna need just
a little bit of mustard.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.327
(BABY CRYING)

43:13.132 --> 43:15.499
- He's up again.
- Who's up again?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.043
Baby Sam, of course.

43:19.013 --> 43:23.007
Ah, yes.
Another son of Sam.

43:23.392 --> 43:24.849
I like the name Sam.

43:25.354 --> 43:32.100
Not to be confused with Samuel, Sammy,
Sam Junior, and of course Samson.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.399
(BARKING)

43:33.694 --> 43:34.650
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

43:36.197 --> 43:38.655
- Good evening, folks.
- Evening, Henner.

43:43.162 --> 43:46.576
Henner, these are our
cousins, Jacob and Emma.

43:47.333 --> 43:50.201
So soon.
Well, that's good, huh?

43:55.341 --> 43:58.960
- Guess who's got a boyfriend.
- Yeah, well, you go, girl.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.503
"You go, girl"?

44:02.056 --> 44:05.049
Yeah.
In very liberal Ordnungs,

44:06.060 --> 44:08.518
that just means "he's hot."

44:10.690 --> 44:11.976
Father?

44:12.942 --> 44:14.433
Yeah, you're excused.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.186
You go, girl.

44:22.118 --> 44:23.450
(BABY CRYING)

44:28.124 --> 44:30.912
Another brilliant idea
by Brad Sexton.

44:32.253 --> 44:36.293
(WHISPERING) Caroline, get
some rest. We'll sleep late.

44:36.966 --> 44:40.960
I'll get to that phone. I'll call
Phil. He'll... send a car for us.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.631
You better tell Phil to make it
snappy! I don't like it here.

44:46.517 --> 44:51.228
These people are not right.
They're like children of the corn.

44:53.441 --> 44:54.557
(CRYING STOPS)

44:58.404 --> 45:01.818
Oh, finally. Thank God.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.232
(INAUDIBLE)

45:07.038 --> 45:08.074
(MOANS)

45:12.168 --> 45:14.251
(YAWNS)

45:18.132 --> 45:20.749
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Morning!

45:21.052 --> 45:21.963
(SCREAMS)

45:23.471 --> 45:25.337
- Who are you?
- Come on, Grandpa.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.972
Up you go, lazybones.

45:27.142 --> 45:29.633
Thought we'd get the west
40 done before breakfast.

45:31.687 --> 45:34.555
Look at that, honey, it's almost
4:45. We must've over-slept!

45:34.899 --> 45:36.265
Emma, Emma, Emma!

45:37.026 --> 45:38.858
Good morning, Emma!

45:39.153 --> 45:41.361
Good morning, corn child.

45:45.826 --> 45:49.945
This is Molly,
and this is Mae.

45:51.415 --> 45:55.250
Two good, honest workers.
Though Molly gave me a big scare

45:55.544 --> 45:57.206
last week,
didn't you, girl?

45:57.505 --> 45:58.871
Have a look at her pastern.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.008
(MOUTHING)
Pastern?

46:07.598 --> 46:10.841
Oh, I see
what you mean.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.014
No, her pastern.

46:18.985 --> 46:22.023
Thought you said
"ass burn." (CHUCKLES)

46:22.947 --> 46:26.361
- SAMMY: Pa, come quick!
- Sammy, leave him.

46:27.159 --> 46:30.368
Now, Jacob, here's where
your expertise comes in.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.612
Huh?

46:34.283 --> 46:38.543
Strong bloodlines, perfect conformation,
but he's the most ornery animal

46:38.838 --> 46:42.002
I ever owned. Got him at
auction three months ago.

46:43.718 --> 46:46.335
You may be the best horse
trainer in Missouri, Jacob,

46:46.804 --> 46:49.296
but even you could
have trouble with this one.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.885
Meet Big John.

47:00.484 --> 47:02.100
(WHINNYING)

47:02.862 --> 47:05.445
(GROANING)

47:12.788 --> 47:15.701
Couldn't we just have
rice cakes for breakfast?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.788
Emma, these apples
are not for breakfast.

47:19.086 --> 47:21.419
They're for the schnitz pies
we'll be making this afternoon.

47:21.714 --> 47:25.048
Oh, yeah. There's nothing
like a good schnitz pie.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.260
Emma, do you need
some coffee?

47:29.972 --> 47:36.469
Coffee? This is a coffee-drinking
Ordnung? Oh, praise the lord, sister.

47:37.438 --> 47:38.428
Mmm.

47:43.652 --> 47:44.563
Mmm.

47:44.889 --> 47:48.481
That is the most beautiful quilt
I've ever seen. Look at those colors.

47:48.783 --> 47:52.993
It's just so vibrant and bold.
And that stitching is so intricate.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.992
Whoever made this quilt
is quite the artist.

47:57.500 --> 48:00.083
Oh, Emma, that is
the quilt you made.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.206
Well, and you know what? Now that
I'm looking at it, it's not so swell.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.249
Because I can see that it's sort
of flawed. I think maybe it was

48:07.551 --> 48:08.758
just the way
the light was hitting it.

48:09.053 --> 48:13.013
No, you truly are gifted
with the needle, Emma.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.764
All the women here
are so excited

48:15.059 --> 48:18.393
to learn your double-cross
wedding ring pattern.

48:19.897 --> 48:20.808
Beg pardon?

48:21.148 --> 48:23.014
Yes, I showed them
all your samples.

48:48.551 --> 48:49.587
(WHINNYING)

48:50.553 --> 48:51.509
(BARKING)

48:53.931 --> 48:54.967
(GROANS)

49:25.504 --> 49:26.540
Back up.

50:14.220 --> 50:17.304
Um, hip-hop.
Move on.

50:17.598 --> 50:19.385
- Big John.
- (NEIGHS)

50:19.683 --> 50:22.801
Come on, now. Go now, go now.
We gotta go. We gotta go on.

50:27.107 --> 50:28.188
Easy for you.

50:28.484 --> 50:29.600
(WHINNYING)

50:31.445 --> 50:32.435
Ow!

50:32.863 --> 50:34.274
Whoa, whoa!

50:35.115 --> 50:38.233
Whoa! John!
Yo-ho, John!

50:38.702 --> 50:40.534
We are plowing now!

50:46.669 --> 50:47.785
(GROANING)

50:53.884 --> 50:55.967
Kissed by the sun today,
eh, Cousin Jacob?

50:57.263 --> 50:58.674
(LAUGHS MISERABLY) Ouch.

50:58.744 --> 51:02.966
Well, I must say we are blessed to
have you here for spring planting.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.267
Another man
makes all the difference.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.976
Well, I'm just happy
to be here.

51:08.274 --> 51:11.688
Maybe tomorrow Big John will give
in to your training techniques

51:11.758 --> 51:13.727
and you can start
on the north 20.

51:14.863 --> 51:16.820
- Huh?
- Excited, huh?

51:17.241 --> 51:18.482
Very.

51:20.578 --> 51:21.659
(SOFTLY) Ow.

51:22.997 --> 51:24.329
Are you hungry, Jacob?

51:24.623 --> 51:26.831
As a matter of fact, I am.
Thank you, Emma.

51:26.901 --> 51:29.584
Emma made your
very favorite dish.

51:29.878 --> 51:31.540
- Mmm.
- You don't know how to cook.

51:31.839 --> 51:36.129
Liver, kidney,
and lung casserole.

51:36.885 --> 51:37.875
Huh?

51:40.764 --> 51:41.800
(GROANS)

51:44.893 --> 51:47.226
Oh, look at that.

51:48.188 --> 51:52.558
Eat up, Jacob. You're gonna need
your strength tomorrow, honey.

51:55.321 --> 51:56.687
(RETCHING)

52:06.707 --> 52:08.915
(GROANING)

52:11.462 --> 52:12.543
(CHUCKLES MENACINGLY)

52:14.632 --> 52:16.999
Wow. Lipstick, for me?

52:17.301 --> 52:21.921
Oh, honey, you look beat.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.259
Let me draw you a bath.

52:25.601 --> 52:26.591
(RETCHES)

52:27.478 --> 52:28.719
Indigestion?

52:29.521 --> 52:30.978
Don't remember eating that.

52:31.273 --> 52:32.284
Guess what?

52:33.973 --> 52:35.984
Emma doesn't have
to cook tomorrow.

52:37.321 --> 52:40.940
Guess what? Jacob may not let
her live to see tomorrow.

52:41.241 --> 52:44.393
Do me the favor. Do you know
what I did all day long?

52:44.463 --> 52:47.404
I was on my hands and knees
scrubbing floors.

52:47.706 --> 52:49.948
Wait a minute. What is that,
violins? Can you hear them?

52:50.250 --> 52:53.243
What about me? How about plowing
five acres on a wooly mammoth?

52:53.545 --> 52:55.286
Have you seen the
size of that horse?

52:55.589 --> 52:56.375
Did you call Phil?

52:56.445 --> 52:58.381
Yes, I used the windmill phone.

52:59.134 --> 53:00.875
Town is five miles away.
What was I supposed to do?

53:01.178 --> 53:03.135
Brad, why don't you
make a few more excuses?

53:03.430 --> 53:06.298
I thought we were just passing
through. I didn't know was I gonna

53:06.368 --> 53:08.933
spend the rest of my life
at Yoder State Penitentiary.

53:09.228 --> 53:11.094
- I'll call him tomorrow.
- Fine.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.276
I'm exhausted.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.077
(BANGS)
(GROANS)

53:36.839 --> 53:40.082
(BED CREAKING RHYTHMICALLY)

53:40.384 --> 53:43.548
Please tall me that's
not what I think it is.

53:43.846 --> 53:45.462
Where do they
get the energy?

53:45.764 --> 53:47.926
Must be from
those schnitz pies.

53:49.226 --> 53:51.593
Certainly not one of
your schnitz pies.

53:54.565 --> 53:55.476
(NOISE STOPS)

53:56.900 --> 53:59.313
Thank God,
they're quick.

54:03.031 --> 54:06.115
(SIGHS) Like somebody
else I know.

54:10.831 --> 54:11.821
(SIGHS)

54:16.587 --> 54:18.829
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Morning!

54:19.339 --> 54:20.250
(SCREAMS)

54:22.634 --> 54:24.842
Look, it's already 4:45.

54:25.220 --> 54:26.176
(CLEARS THROAT)

54:26.722 --> 54:30.261
Whoa, wow, that's
a pretty big number.

54:31.518 --> 54:33.100
Are you gentlemen
sure this is correct?

54:33.395 --> 54:36.308
We do tend to frown on
excessive write-offs, sir.

54:36.899 --> 54:40.313
I'd love to help you, guys, but
I'm completely in the dark here.

54:41.612 --> 54:44.650
Well, then
here's a little light.

54:44.948 --> 54:46.985
If I find out
you're not acting

54:47.284 --> 54:48.775
in complete cooperation...

54:49.077 --> 54:51.319
Believe me, I don't need
any trouble with the IRS.

54:51.997 --> 54:55.411
You don't know how right
you are, Mr. Fancy Desk.

54:59.296 --> 55:01.458
If you hear from him,
give us a call.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.922
Mr. Fancy Desk?

55:07.846 --> 55:09.382
What an asshole.

55:10.015 --> 55:12.382
LESTER: Let's get a good
old-fashioned tap on his line.

55:12.726 --> 55:13.762
HALL:
Can we do that?

55:14.061 --> 55:15.643
We're the IRS.
We do anything we want.

55:15.938 --> 55:16.598
Sir?

55:16.897 --> 55:18.604
Trust me, son,
I know cheaters.

55:18.899 --> 55:22.017
Right now, the Sextons are kicking
back in some fancy Caribbean resort,

55:22.319 --> 55:25.107
slugging down rum drinks and
copulating in unconventional ways.

55:25.405 --> 55:27.112
They're having
the time of their lives.

55:27.741 --> 55:28.652
(GRUNTS)

55:30.869 --> 55:32.326
That's it!

55:39.336 --> 55:42.295
You know what I'm thinking about
right now, Big John? Glue.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.831
And I'm not talking about
white glue, carpenter's glue.

55:45.133 --> 55:46.840
I'm talking
about stick glue.

55:47.135 --> 55:48.091
(NEIGHS)

55:48.512 --> 55:49.798
Gosh, where does
glue come from?

55:50.097 --> 55:51.178
Anybody?

55:51.765 --> 55:53.006
Your feet.

55:54.393 --> 55:55.429
(LAUGHS)

55:55.727 --> 55:57.184
It's pretty simple, pal.

55:57.479 --> 56:01.814
Be submissive,
or be adhesive.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.611
You're a plow horse. There's
nothing wrong with that.

56:07.406 --> 56:10.649
Show some self-respect. They're
talking about you in the barn.

56:11.493 --> 56:13.405
Molly and Mae,
I heard them.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.162
(IN MOCK FEMALE VOICE) "Ooh,
that Big John. What a stud.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.869
High in the rear.
And check out his pastern."

56:19.167 --> 56:19.998
(SNORTS)

56:20.304 --> 56:24.462
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, do you want
to be a failure the rest of your life?

56:24.882 --> 56:29.593
No, no.
Let's till the soil!

56:33.056 --> 56:35.969
I didn't mean to yell.
I was... I was venting.

56:36.685 --> 56:38.392
Let it go.
Let it go.

56:42.691 --> 56:45.684
All right, Big John,
you and me and the dirt.

56:48.530 --> 56:50.066
Hi-dee-ho.
Let's go!

56:50.365 --> 56:51.321
(WHINNIES)

56:58.999 --> 57:01.742
No, no, honey. Sweetie,
go back home. Shoo. Shoo.

57:03.587 --> 57:06.705
BRAD: Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

57:07.007 --> 57:09.169
(CHUCKLING)
All right. Caroline,

57:10.594 --> 57:11.584
I'm plowing.

57:12.596 --> 57:14.553
Yee-haw, Brad.

57:14.848 --> 57:18.307
I bet these people don't get a chance
to see the zigzag pattern very often.

57:18.977 --> 57:22.470
You know, I think I'm really
getting the hang of this.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.644
(SCOFFS) That's great,
Mr. Green jeans.

57:26.610 --> 57:28.067
Is that for me?

57:30.822 --> 57:32.029
Thank you.

57:32.324 --> 57:34.281
Don't read
anything into it.

57:34.618 --> 57:36.860
You said you were going
to call Phil today.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.619
So could you go
make the call?

57:38.914 --> 57:41.076
I'm ready to exit
the 19th century.

57:41.792 --> 57:44.205
Oh, and while you're at it, could
you get me a carton of cigarettes

57:44.503 --> 57:45.539
and some
Extra Strength Tylenol?

57:47.547 --> 57:48.537
What?

57:49.132 --> 57:50.589
Aren't you going?

57:50.884 --> 57:53.877
I can't go. I promised Samuel
I'd plow the rest of this field.

57:54.179 --> 57:54.760
Oh!

57:55.055 --> 57:56.591
I have gotta
get out of here.

57:56.890 --> 58:00.224
They've got me paring
and pickling and plucking.

58:00.519 --> 58:03.182
And that annoying little girl
follows me everywhere I go.

58:03.647 --> 58:06.139
You know what? Prison
couldn't be worse than this.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.441
Would you stop
complaining?

58:09.736 --> 58:13.195
Oh, now what? You're
taking the horse to town?

58:13.907 --> 58:15.489
No, I think
I'll take the subway.

58:15.784 --> 58:16.900
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

58:17.536 --> 58:20.028
Brad, you cannot
ride that thing.

58:21.790 --> 58:25.204
This is not a thing,
Caroline. This is a horse.

58:25.502 --> 58:26.743
His name is Big John.

58:27.337 --> 58:29.750
And he and I have come
to an understanding.

58:31.216 --> 58:33.503
I hope the two of you'll
be very happy together.

58:33.802 --> 58:35.714
I need some help getting up
on the horse, however.

58:36.013 --> 58:36.969
Are you serious?

58:37.264 --> 58:38.220
Could we...

58:38.515 --> 58:39.596
(SCOFFS)

58:40.392 --> 58:41.974
Give me your foot.

58:42.436 --> 58:43.426
Jump.

58:44.354 --> 58:45.265
(GRUNTS)

58:48.608 --> 58:50.816
Hey. I'll need my hat.

58:51.111 --> 58:51.976
Oh.

58:52.279 --> 58:53.440
All right.

58:55.741 --> 58:57.858
All right, Johnny,
let's go to town.

59:03.206 --> 59:04.572
Johnny, you know
where town is.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.787
Come on, buddy, don't
make me look bad. Johnny.

59:06.857 --> 59:08.792
- Allow me.
- What?

59:09.087 --> 59:10.168
(WHINNIES)

59:10.797 --> 59:12.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:12.674 --> 59:14.336
John, John.
Come on, John.

59:14.634 --> 59:16.842
Don't forget my cigarettes!

59:17.345 --> 59:21.009
Whoa! Yeah, yeah, okay.
Yeah. John, John.

59:21.308 --> 59:22.264
Whoa.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.179
No, don't tell me. I can't
know where you are.

59:25.479 --> 59:26.435
But, Phil.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.642
Careful. I'm sure by now
they've tapped the line.

59:28.940 --> 59:30.681
<i>Hi ya, fellas.
How are tricks?</i>

59:30.984 --> 59:32.941
<i>I know how
these morons operate.</i>

59:33.236 --> 59:34.943
BRAD: <i>Phil, did you
get hold of Lachman?</i>

59:35.238 --> 59:38.652
No, not yet. But I did manage
to get a copy of your returns.

59:39.117 --> 59:42.030
Very interesting reading.
Brad, when did you buy a jet?

59:42.913 --> 59:44.245
I don't have a jet.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.906
Well, you deducted one.
And, uh, what about this...

59:47.834 --> 59:49.621
How big a schooner?

59:51.421 --> 59:54.255
Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil, you don't
believe I have any of this shit, do you?

59:54.325 --> 59:55.039
Should I?

59:55.109 --> 59:56.458
Lachman!

59:56.760 --> 59:59.002
Brad, calm down,
or I can't help you.

59:59.304 --> 01:00:04.174
Well, I'm so sorry. I've just spent the
last day getting my ass kicked by Big John.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:08.060
PHIL: <i>Brad, no names. Look,
I've got a couple of ideas.</i>

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.472
Let me do my magic. I'll get
back to you in a week or two.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.766
Or two?

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.817
Two? Phil, Phil, Phil.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.234
Shit!

01:00:16.304 --> 01:00:20.777
Finally, the break we needed. Get
the files on every single gangster

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:23.693
in the Western Hemisphere
named Big John. Everyone!

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:31.750
Jacob. Uh, Jacob?

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:36.210
Yes. Just call me Jake,
Henner.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:40.089
Jake, uh, could you,
uh, spare a minute?

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:43.471
Does it involve
any heavy lifting?

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:44.630
No.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.595
Good. What do you want?

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:50.182
Well, uh, you know,
here in our Ordnung,

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.472
men don't speak much
about certain things.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.266
Actually, they don't
speak much, period.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:59.153
Yeah, so I was hoping
because your Ordnung

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.564
is so liberal that
I could ask you about...

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.159
(STAMMERING) I could say,
I could, for example...

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.570
Henner, Henner, Henner, Henner,
come on, take a break.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.534
What do you want to ask me?

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.415
(MUTTERING)
Um. Women.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.247
(MIMICKING ACCENT)
"Vimen"?

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:15.710
Women.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.079
Vermin?

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:18.748
No! Women!

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.757
- "Vimen"?
- Women.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:22.294
- Women!
- Women.

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:23.507
(CHUCKLING) Okay, okay.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:24.591
What do you want to know?

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.381
Marriage.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.007
Oh.

01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:30.767
You and Rebecca?

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:31.973
Yeah.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.263
See, I think
about it constantly.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:37.024
I'm practicing, I'm preparing
what I'm going to say.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:40.983
And then, you know, I see her and then
the words, they leave my head, and I...

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:42.317
Something's wrong with me.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.323
Nothing's wrong with you.
Women do that to men.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.735
It's called
being in love.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.404
But in our Ordnung, men...

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.619
You cannot marry without at
least two years of courting.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.916
Ah, and you want
to jump the gun.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.619
Uh, take the plunge.

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:58.129
Buy the cow.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.793
Idioms aren't your thing,
are they?

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.588
You want to get
married right away.

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:05.177
Yes.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.304
Hey! Whoo. (WHISTLING)

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.306
But, uh, well, um...

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.763
How long did you court
before you were married?

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:15.471
Six weeks.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.436
Six... You were married
after six weeks?

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.526
Oh, it seemed
like two years.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.990
And we really,
really loved each other.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.448
So, Emma was all
you could think about.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.204
You wanted nothing more than
to be in her company, yeah?

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:35.583
Every moment, all of the
day and the night, no?

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.912
Incredibly, yes.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:40.708
(EXCLAIMS IN DELIGHT)

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.964
All that is needed is love.
I knew this.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.469
I knew this in my heart, but I
was afraid to defy the elders.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:50.177
(STAMMERING) Don't defy
on account of me.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:54.890
Thank you, Jacob. Thank you for
your strength and your wisdom.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.137
(GROANS)

01:02:58.033 --> 01:02:59.894
Great, great, great. Save
this for the honeymoon, okay?

Thank you.

CAROLINE: (SCREAMING) What do
you mean we have to stay here?

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:09.992
Keep your voice down, Emma.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:13.200
I will not keep my voice down!
And stop calling me Emma!

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:14.488
Did you get my cigarettes?

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.158
No one's going to find us here.
It's not that bad.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.951
You get free food,
free lodging...

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:23.544
Free food, my ass! I've never
worked so hard in my life for a meal!

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.917
Please keep your voice down.

01:03:25.987 --> 01:03:28.586
I won't keep my voice down. I don't
understand what's going on here.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:30.720
Two days ago, you and I
were getting a divorce.

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.678
And finally, I was going
to be rid of you.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:36.686
I don't have to stay here another
day, do you hear me, Jacob?

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.473
Fine, Emma, do what
you want. Leave.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.894
Pack your bags
and leave!

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.570
- Fine.

(SOBS DRAMATICALLY)

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.783
You were right.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:58.790
Marital discord.
It's such a shame.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:03.625
Must be why they came early, hoping
a change would make a difference.

God has sent them
to us, Levinia.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:16.593
I'm not sure how we can
help them, but we must try.

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:23.561
Jacob?

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.271
Evening, Samuel.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.612
We need to speak.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.657
Okay. About what?

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:33.738
You don't think we
know what's going on?

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:45.038
I didn't mean to put your
family in the middle of this.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.625
Truth is, we were desperate.

Up You-know-what Creek
without a paddle.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.512
Shit Creek?

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.256
That's the one.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.972
I don't know what to say.
Look, I'm sorry.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.475
I know what I did was wrong.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:03.855
We were just so scared.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.267
Everything just
started to snowball.

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.728
We needed a place to hide.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.522
Oh, you mustn't hide
from your problems, Jacob.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:16.035
You must confront them. If you turn
your back, they'll only get bigger.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.951
You must show no fear
and stand in their way.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.243
That's not easy when you're
facing prison, Samuel.

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.208
Oh, marriage is hardly
a prison sentence, Jacob.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.550
Marriage? My marriage.

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:34.462
"Prison" was
too strong a word.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:40.010
I meant sometimes it makes
me feel... claustrophobic, huh?

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.230
Well, uh, all husbands
and wives have periods

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.733
of disagreement
and heartache.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.483
But the harsh words,
the evil looks.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.990
You don't want to live like that
the rest of your days, do you?

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:58.031
Oh, Levinia, do we
have to do this?

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:01.572
The vow of marriage,
the love.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.367
These aren't
just words, Cousin.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:08.583
It's the commitment we live by
and hold second only to God.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:16.053
So that would
make God first, right?

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:22.681
Remember, you wrote about
your picnics by the lake,

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:25.266
mating in the barn
with wild abandon.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:26.521
Ah! (CHUCKLES)

01:06:26.991 --> 01:06:30.314
I'm afraid our barn-mating
days are long gone.

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:33.980
It's been a long time since she's
opened her barn for me, Samuel.

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:37.108
But every day can
be a new beginning.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.072
That's the beauty
of marriage.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.532
Look inside
your heart, Jacob.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.868
And put hers
above your own.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:47.376
Once you've settled in, you
won't have time to be sad.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.747
Now, let's go scrub
the kitchen floor.

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.540
Oh, could we?

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:53.999
Yes.

01:06:54.999 --> 01:06:59.180
Samuel, thanks for the talk. I feel a lot
better now that it's all out in the open.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:02.429
(GRUNTS)

01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:05.929

of a grip on you, Samuel.

serving nine life sentences.

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.527
Not so cool anymore.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.741
Stick with it, son. Our
reputations are at stake,

01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:25.156
and I will not be
made a fool of.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.495
- Too late.
- How's that?

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:28.875

"I'll be working late."

believe in shock absorbers?

Just try to enjoy the ride.
Look at this carriage.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:15.084
100 years old. Looks
brand-new, doesn't it?

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:17.170
You just don't see
quality like this anymore.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.756
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.341
You've crossed over.
You're one of them now.

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:26.595
Every day's just a constant reminder
that I don't know how to do anything.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.225
You're just feeling sorry
for yourself, Caroline.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.602
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:32.479
No, I'm not. These women
know how to do everything.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:36.564
Hell, I can't even cook or sew.
I'm domestically challenged.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.104
(LAUGHS) That's funny.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.283
No, it's not.
It's not funny at all.

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:44.488
I feel so useless here.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.950
We can do this.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:50.874
You still know how to
work a party, don't you?

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.033
Yes.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.252
All right, fine,
let's go.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:56.709
All right. Come on.
There we go.

They're all dressed alike and
they're still having a good time.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.609
Well, you didn't all wear
the same thing back home?

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.406
A liberal Ordnung.

- A liberal Ordnung.
- A liberal Ordnung.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.703
Back in Missouri, you
probably wear many colors,

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.504
perhaps even
different styles?

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.290
Mmm.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.175
Your Ordnung and so many others have
become much less rigid in that area.

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:44.340
But here, we're
still very limited.

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:48.966
Our Leadership Council has taken the color
issue under consideration numerous times.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:50.679
They always vote no.

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:54.015
They say these are colors.
The only colors.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.979
Well, I'm sorry, but I
think it's ridiculous.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.485
I mean, it's not that black
isn't the timeless classic.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:04.364
It's just that, what's wrong with
wearing pastels and soft earth tones?

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:07.823
We could wear color and still
maintain group conformity.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:12.949
Emma, this is the first moment
since you arrived that,

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.868
well, the subject seems
to bring out a fire in you.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.830
I have to admit,
clothes are my passion.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:22.128
After the Lord,
of course.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:25.131
Well, we all share
your feeling.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:29.799
Color is present in everything else
God touches, so why not what we wear?

meets next week.

I made this for you.

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:09.464
Oh, no, thank you. No. Uh,
chocolate and I just aren't...

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.017
I have an addiction.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.852
Oh, all right.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:25.028
Mmm. Oh, Lord.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.356
Emma, are you praying?

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:30.526
Mmm-hmm. I'm praying
that I can stop eating this.

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.113
Thank you.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.658
- Hello.

- I think she likes you.
- Mmm.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.753
Mmm. And I think
you like her.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:47.008
No, no, she's just
enamored with me.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:50.257
She's never met a chain-smoking
chocoholic before.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:55.058
Wait a minute. Something's gonna
happen. Something wonderful.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.517
I would like to
marry your daughter.

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:12.943
I have an announcement.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:19.575
I'd like to make known that, as
of today, my daughter, Rebecca,

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.746
is engaged to wed
Mr. Henner Lapp.

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:37.593
Well, I hope they'll
be really happy.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.432
Why did we get married?

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:47.645
I don't know.

01:12:48.282 --> 01:12:51.740
I guess we thought it was a
smart thing to do at the time.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.026
You were working at Saks.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:57.070
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.161
You came in there and you were going to
buy these really stupid-looking socks,

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.291
and I sold you a suit instead.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:06.581
I still have that suit. But
you're right about those socks.

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:10.838
So I went to Saks
looking for socks,

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.174
and I got a suit
and some sex.

I was really handsome?

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:23.605
Are. (SCOFFS)

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.069

really love me?

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:41.286
You mean like that?

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:47.329
Did you ever
love me like that?

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:50.920
It was a long time ago.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.881
Yeah. Well, we were
different people then.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.091
Yeah.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:59.133

how to cut a rug.

for appearance sake?

- Sure, I don't care.

the 20 acres across from him.

you get a geological on it?

at the grade of that. Yeah.

like to come with us?

to go, though.

Ordnung?

01:16:41.539 --> 01:16:45.348
Yes. It refers to the closed communities
of the Mennonites or the Amish.

They don't pay taxes.

the horse and buggy?

Where will it end?

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:02.816
Well, with all
due respect,

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.577
I hardly think that our
wearing colorful dresses

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:09.490
is going to lead to tattoos
or monster truck rallies.

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.871
In the Bible
it is written,

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:15.878
"Women shall adorn themselves
with modesty and sobriety,

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.924
"without braided hair
or costly array."

are vibrant and joyful.

these little black drab numbers.

yourselves wake up and you think,

the mood to wear pink"?

always rather do business with you Amish.

property at a rock-bottom price.

than we have in mind.

on this one. It's way below market.

think, Jacob?

with you two,

You tell me, Mr. Yoder, is this
property perfect for that boy, or what?

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.292
Let me just say, sir, that
I think it's extraordinary

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.378
the way you people
help each other out.

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:26.418
Uh, you're quiet
and reserved.

we love doing business with you Amish.

So, hey, what can we do
to wrap this thing up?

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.886
For starters,
we could take your offer,

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:39.431
wrap it up in a tight, little
wad and shove it up your ass.

a good negotiator.

down that much...

Very impressive, Jacob.

It was nothing.

I could help.

Thanks to the miracle of your
semi-modern technologies,

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:42.411
we've got bupkis.

01:36:42.714 --> 01:36:44.250
Look, just because
Intercourse didn't pay off

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.256
doesn't mean your
Dirty Harry technique

01:36:46.326 --> 01:36:48.258
is better than modern
forensic science.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:51.421
Is that so? Well, who's got more
movies, Clint Eastwood or Jack Klugman?

01:36:51.723 --> 01:36:52.588
Answer that.

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:53.971
What?

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:56.634
The only way to solve cases
is running down leads,

01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:59.644
grilling suspects,
long, lonely nights.

01:36:59.939 --> 01:37:03.148
And sure, occasionally you come
home and your wife's in bed

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.605
with the bottled water guy.
But so what?

01:37:05.903 --> 01:37:08.691
Boo-hoo. You blow your nose.
You move on.

01:37:09.365 --> 01:37:12.324
Good old-fashioned police
work is the only way.

01:37:13.286 --> 01:37:14.197
Sir, look out!

01:37:15.121 --> 01:37:16.407
That's a cow.

01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:20.453
That's a sign.

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:32.260
Hey.

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:37.054
On the other hand, sometimes
you just get lucky.

01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:41.561
Uh, sir, I think
I'm messing myself.

01:37:42.231 --> 01:37:43.813
Walk it off, son.

01:37:45.193 --> 01:37:49.153
ELDER: The vows you have taken,
you take for a lifetime.

01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:54.195
These are promises which you
make to each other with respect,

01:37:55.703 --> 01:38:00.243
with kindness and fairness
and with honor to each other,

01:38:02.126 --> 01:38:05.619
with all lowliness,
meekness,

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:09.624
forbearing one
another in love,

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:16.138
endeavoring to hold the unity of
the spirit with a bond of peace.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:19.262
Neither time,
nor temperament,

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.394
nor force of nature
shall diminish the solemnity

01:38:22.688 --> 01:38:25.146
- of this holy union in the eyes of God.
- (SHUSHING)

01:38:25.483 --> 01:38:29.818
This commitment you make to each
other is sanctified in His name.

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:34.323
So, will you, Rebecca, take
Henner to be your husband,

01:38:35.034 --> 01:38:36.445
to love and to cherish,

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:39.077
to honor and obey
till death do you part?

01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:41.530
REBECCA: I will.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.076
ELDER: And do you, Henner, take Rebecca
to be your wife, to love and to cherish,

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.458
to honor and obey
till death do you part?

01:38:48.965 --> 01:38:50.376
HENNER: I will.

01:38:50.446 --> 01:38:56.512
So, today, before your friends,
relatives, brothers and sisters,

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:58.840
I offer you my blessings.

How do you tell them apart?
They all look alike to me.

01:40:01.996 --> 01:40:06.161
Okay, people, we're
looking for the Yoders.

01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:14.798
That worked well.

01:40:15.092 --> 01:40:16.549
What is this about, please?

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:20.053
It's about Jacob
and Emma Yoder, please.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.217
I am Jacob Yoder.

01:40:22.558 --> 01:40:24.015
And I am Emma.

01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:27.803
You are not. They are.
Aren't you, Jacob? Tell them.

01:41:13.401 --> 01:41:15.393
Maybe we should ask
for a public defender.

01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:17.527
Phil's office swore
he'd be here.

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:18.733
Okay.

01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:23.488
Hi.

01:41:24.412 --> 01:41:26.574
It's nice of them to come.

01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:29.914
What on Earth
is she wearing?

01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:33.122
Looks like something from
Mizrahi's "Milkmaid" line.

01:41:33.421 --> 01:41:35.378
Hmm, I like
the no-button look.

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:36.834
Yeah, you would.

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:38.544
I wonder how Brad's gonna dig
his way out of this one.

01:41:38.843 --> 01:41:40.675
Looks like they're going
for the Quaker defense.

You're looking very well.

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:16.169
I should be shocked at the
list of charges against you.

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:20.959

it rings all too true.

I know they're some questions
about our tax matters.

Mr. Sexton,
where is your attorney?

01:42:55.127 --> 01:42:56.493
I don't know.

01:42:56.796 --> 01:42:59.038
Well, then, who is going
to represent the defense?

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.456
There is no defense.

01:43:00.758 --> 01:43:02.499
We just want to be held
accountable for what we've done.

01:43:02.802 --> 01:43:04.668
We want to make things right.

And as I was arranging to
extradite his considerable ass,

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:21.832
I did a little business with a

over the Holy Land deal.

very expensive needs.

you. I didn't want to burden you.

We know what
we did was very wrong.

We betrayed your trust.
And we hurt you.

I wish this never happened,

Coming here was the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

01:47:54.093 --> 01:47:57.928
Where we live, real friends
are very hard to find.

01:48:02.267 --> 01:48:06.227
Samuel, you told me to look inside
my heart to find forgiveness.

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:10.272
That's what we want
you to do now.

01:48:16.532 --> 01:48:17.568
Come on.

01:48:20.828 --> 01:48:22.364
For what it's worth,
thank you.

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.663
I know I wasn't very good
at scrubbing floors,

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.746
but I really loved
spending time with you.

you're so smart.

01:48:40.014 --> 01:48:41.004
What?

Do you really think
we didn't know?

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:53.354
Yeah, yes. Then why
didn't you say something?

01:48:54.319 --> 01:48:55.810
Planting season.

01:48:58.032 --> 01:48:59.694
We needed the extra help.

Besides, you looked
like you needed help, too.

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:11.451

planting season.

01:49:13.047 --> 01:49:14.959

you need corn.

to give you something.

use pocket watches,

to have mine.

Oh, that is very kind. But in our
Ordnung, we don't accept gifts.

have that's ever meant anything to me.

we could barter.

How about a Swiss
for a Belgian?

Well, you throw in
some corn, it's a deal.

This has been quite a day,
hasn't it?

01:50:43.762 --> 01:50:48.507
Yes, it has. I came to say
sorry to Sam, did a good deed,

01:50:49.518 --> 01:50:51.384
ended up with some feed
and a steed.

And don't forget a basket
full of schnitz pies.

01:50:57.568 --> 01:50:58.684
Oh, you're the schnitz pie.

01:50:58.986 --> 01:51:00.443
No, baby,
you're the schnitz.

01:51:25.721 --> 01:51:26.802
Marker.

01:51:27.097 --> 01:51:28.258
Action.

01:51:28.557 --> 01:51:30.765
I think I just realized why
they call him "Big John."

01:51:31.476 --> 01:51:32.762
Would you let it go!

01:51:33.896 --> 01:51:34.977
(SHRIEKING)
Oh, no!

01:51:38.192 --> 01:51:39.399
Here.

01:51:43.238 --> 01:51:44.149
(SCREAMS) Brad!

01:51:57.794 --> 01:51:58.705
Chicken!

01:52:04.593 --> 01:52:07.506
I think we finally found
something you're good at.

01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:11.506
- (BONE CRACKING)
- (SCREAMS IN PAIN)

01:52:18.941 --> 01:52:19.977
(SIGHS)

01:52:24.363 --> 01:52:25.695
- (LATCH RATTLING)
- LEVINIA: Just a minute!

01:52:25.989 --> 01:52:27.025
Oh, excuse me.

01:52:27.324 --> 01:52:30.362
I had debts. I had needs,
very expensive needs.

01:52:30.661 --> 01:52:35.326
Fine wines, the Rolls, special
shoes. I have high arches.

01:52:35.874 --> 01:52:38.833
It's very hard to find a
corrective shoe in a slip-on.

01:52:39.544 --> 01:52:40.660
(LAUGHS)

01:52:52.557 --> 01:52:54.048
Emma, I'll wait for you.

01:52:54.351 --> 01:52:55.432
(SARCASTICALLY)
Oh, good.

01:53:01.441 --> 01:53:02.352
(SCREAMS)

01:53:07.489 --> 01:53:08.400
(GAGGING)

01:53:10.993 --> 01:53:12.655
There they are.

01:53:13.036 --> 01:53:14.493
Brad, look out!

01:53:15.205 --> 01:53:16.992
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

01:53:27.009 --> 01:53:27.920
(SPITS)

01:53:32.306 --> 01:53:34.389
Look at this.
It's déjà vu.

01:53:35.851 --> 01:53:37.183
It's the same cow,
isn't it?

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:39.469
Yeah, and the same pond.

01:53:40.188 --> 01:53:43.306
You know what? I bet I could
get it for a good price.

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:46.188
And it would be a terrific
place to raise the baby.

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:48.978
Yep.
What?
