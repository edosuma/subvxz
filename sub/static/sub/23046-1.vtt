03:01.048 --> 03:02.748
Good morning.
Nice to you see you.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.449
You all look very dapper
and beautiful.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.718
I like the red, very holiday.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.198
All right. As you all see
we are in mid-December

03:08.222 --> 03:11.957
and our holiday content
is in full swing.

03:12.092 --> 03:15.460
Epiphany has never looked
more festive. Look at it.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.030
I am very proud of the hard work

03:18.132 --> 03:20.766
that each and every one of you
has put in this last year.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.434
You've done a great job.
Thank you.

03:22.536 --> 03:27.272
However, Epiphany's traffic
has gone down about 20%

03:27.374 --> 03:28.240
since last December.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.841
Yeah. I mean,

03:29.944 --> 03:32.778
it's like competition in the
online magazine world is fierce,

03:32.947 --> 03:35.013
I could hardly keep up.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.916
Let me guess. Another
pregnant woman needed saving

03:38.052 --> 03:39.484
on the way to work this morning?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.119
(muffled) Uh, no, no, no.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.120
It was, um...

03:42.223 --> 03:43.722
Litter of kittens.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.190
Very sad.

03:45.292 --> 03:48.894
As I was saying, Epiphany's
readership has taken a turn.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.495
People,

03:50.598 --> 03:53.732
they don't want any more of that
New Age hipster holiday fluff.

03:53.867 --> 03:58.170
They want stories of hope,
they want stories of redemption,

03:58.305 --> 03:59.705
they need the proof

03:59.840 --> 04:02.975
that the Christmas magic still
exists out there somewhere.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.144
So it's really important,
really important,

04:06.247 --> 04:09.915
for each and every one of us
to start finding stories

04:10.017 --> 04:12.251
that speak to
the heart of the season.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.954
And I hate to have to say this
but our jobs depend on it.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.923
Um, ho-how do our jobs
depend on it?

04:19.026 --> 04:20.926
Are you saying
there's going to be cuts?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.661
Likely in the new year.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.297
Unless we all get
a Christmas miracle.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.710
And I hate to have to
break this on you guys

04:26.734 --> 04:27.966
right before the holiday

04:28.102 --> 04:30.502
but unfortunately
that's just the way it is.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.005
So, any other questions?

04:33.107 --> 04:35.874
Have you decided who's getting
the Christmas Aspen piece?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.409
Yes, it's going to be you.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.710
(confused chattering)

04:38.812 --> 04:40.178
You're picking him?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.648
Yeah. And you too.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.784
Sorry?
Excuse me?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.964
What do... Wait. What do you mean
that we're both going?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.266
We have two completely different
writing styles.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.722
Yeah, that's right.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.269
One is interesting and fun.
It's clean and professional

04:52.293 --> 04:53.803
versus messy and disorganized.
One is boring and bland.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.160
Boring and bland? Really?

04:55.296 --> 04:56.528
I've been here...
Oh, come on.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.230
Will both of you please stop it?
Stop it!

04:58.365 --> 04:59.665
I said stop before I...

04:59.767 --> 05:01.800
Or do I need to
send both of you to detention?

05:01.902 --> 05:04.670
I mean, these are tough times
in journalism.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.972
Our readers, they need to be
part of a story

05:07.074 --> 05:08.807
that puts them in
the Christmas spirit

05:08.909 --> 05:11.410
so they can remember what
Christmas is truly about.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.045
Which is what exactly again?

05:13.180 --> 05:15.113
You know, that is for
you two to figure out.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.450
All I know is that our readers
should be so enchanted

05:18.585 --> 05:21.520
that they are rushing to
plan their own Aspen Christmas.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.157
And that is why I picked both of
you, my two best writers.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.458
Because you two are wonderful

05:26.560 --> 05:27.871
but you're skilled
in different ways.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.561
And I know this may
sound a little harsh

05:29.697 --> 05:31.430
but I really need to figure out

05:31.565 --> 05:33.365
which one of you is
my most valuable writer.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.700
Hm?
No, really.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.669
Do my readers want soft
and warm and historic?

05:37.771 --> 05:41.707
Or do they want fast and bold
and straight to the point?

05:43.077 --> 05:45.444
Why are those mutually
exclusive? I don't understand.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.786
Well, it's simple. It's simple.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.407
Whichever one of you
can write the piece

05:48.515 --> 05:50.782
that gets the most traffic
to the site,

05:50.918 --> 05:52.684
then you are
my most valuable writer.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.152
And what happens

05:54.288 --> 05:57.089
to the person that doesn't
get the most traffic?

05:57.191 --> 06:00.225
Like I said, we all need
a Christmas miracle.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.993
Flight leaves 1:00pm sharp.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.462
Please don't be late.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.198
I don't care how many kittens
need saving, Mr. Jenner.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.333
Yes, ma'am.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.835
Miss Hudson, I need to
speak with you.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.977
Enchanting is my niche.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.523
Why am I being sent to Aspen
with the class clown?

06:20.547 --> 06:21.547
Will you please stop it?

06:21.682 --> 06:22.581
Please.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.449
I need to protect this company.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.884
Now, how are you doing?

06:25.953 --> 06:28.587
I know this is a hard
time of year for you.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.555
I'm fine.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.224
No. Really.
I need to know, Jenna.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.037
It's only been, what, a month
since you and Andrew broke up?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.301
And I know how excited you were

06:35.396 --> 06:37.629
to meet him and his family
for the holidays.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.098
Oh, no. Everything's great.
I'm happy.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.099
I just want to work.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.734
You know what I think?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.081
I think that it would be good
for you to meet someone new.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.004
Oh.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.106
No, really.

06:47.141 --> 06:48.640
Be open to new experiences.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.920
And you never know, you might
meet somebody in Colorado.

06:50.944 --> 06:51.843
Oh, boy.

06:51.945 --> 06:52.945
I'm going to go now.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.880
Let that hair down
a little bit, girl.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.949
No, really. Loosen up.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.384

and you know that.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.925
I know.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.994
Loosen up!

07:09.129 --> 07:11.096
Goodness.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.231

07:13.400 --> 07:15.767
We're stuck sharing the article.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.470
Well, I'll be on the slopes
most of the time anyway.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.839
Do you board?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.140
Do I look like I board?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.775
That's right.
Robots don't board.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.110

each other's way.

Andrew, if you want to talk
about things I could probably...

Oh, yeah.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.845
Too fast. I'm too fast.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.426
That is so loud.
What is that hunk of junk?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.950
Electronic Quarterback,
totally addicting.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.186
You know there's, like,
1,000 apps you can download

11:28.321 --> 11:30.188
instead of
lugging that thing around.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.068
I got this thing for Christmas
when I was five years old

11:32.092 --> 11:33.391
from my dad. All right?

11:33.527 --> 11:35.794
I held the top score
since I was 12 years old.

11:35.929 --> 11:36.995
Oh, the top score?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.163
The top score.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.931
Wow. On your own game?
That's impressive.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.099
(scoffing)

11:41.234 --> 11:43.334
Trust me. You do not want me
as a competitor.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.536
(laughing) Is that so?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.004
Yeah. In anything.

11:46.106 --> 11:46.805
(chuckling)

11:46.940 --> 11:48.173
You care to prove me wrong?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.308
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.520
Oh, no. No, please.
Be my guest.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.609
Nope. I'm good. Thanks.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.156
Be my guest.
I'd love for you to play it.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.724
No, I really don't want to
irritate on this place

11:54.748 --> 11:56.059
with all the crazy noises
that thing makes.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.260
Oh, you're afraid of
a 12-year-old's score,

11:57.284 --> 11:58.316
is that what it is?

11:58.418 --> 11:59.751
No, I'm fine. I'm good.
Yeah?

11:59.886 --> 12:00.997
I can understand there's
five buttons on this thing

12:01.021 --> 12:02.153
so I get it, you know.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.266
You don't know how to play.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.789
All right. How do you play this?

12:04.891 --> 12:08.326
All right. Do you know
what foot... ball is?

12:08.462 --> 12:11.963
Yes, I know what football is.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.032
So there's three
offensive players

12:14.167 --> 12:15.967
and six defensive
computer controlled players.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.035
Okay.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.181
You press the blue button
to run.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.904
You press the red button
to pass.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.073
Okay.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.374
There we go.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.110
Just like that
over and over again?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.377
Okay, just...
(beeping)

12:26.513 --> 12:27.657
Yeah, don't press the buttons
so hard.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.121
There I go. Oh, look.
I did it again.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.181
It gets more difficult.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.523
As you get to the fourth level.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.285
Oh, did it again.
Let's see. Here we go.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.320
I see that you're doing it.
All right?

12:35.422 --> 12:36.755
Okay. I feel like I'm winning.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.401
I feel like I'm just winning
one right after another.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.802
You're doing okay.
I mean, there's still...

12:39.826 --> 12:40.826
(beeping)
Oh, oh!

12:40.894 --> 12:42.994
(laughing)
It's great.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.029
Look how close I'm getting
to your score.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.899

12:48.034 --> 12:50.034

Touchdown!

12:50.170 --> 12:52.403
Hey.
Sorry.

12:52.506 --> 12:53.972
You're making a scene.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.674
(rumbling)

12:56.777 --> 12:58.443
It's just turbulence.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.985
It's going to be all right.
(dinging)

13:00.080 --> 13:01.479
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

13:01.581 --> 13:04.149
<i>Due to inclement weather
conditions in Colorado</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:06.851

What?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.832

13:09.856 --> 13:11.067
<i>I assure you there is

13:14.594 --> 13:17.495
Emergency landing?

13:17.631 --> 13:20.865

13:21.001 --> 13:22.578
It's supposed to
come out of the ceiling.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.735
I can't breathe.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.437
It's not... it's not
an emergency.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.672
Relax, okay?

13:27.808 --> 13:28.873
I can't breathe.
(laughing)

13:28.975 --> 13:30.775
Don't laugh at me.
I can't breathe.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.177
(hyperventilating)

13:32.312 --> 13:33.611
We're going to land

13:33.747 --> 13:35.658
and then we'll take
the first flight out to Aspen.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.282
All right. It's not a big deal!
Oh, god.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.384
You don't know that.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.717
Yes, I do know that.
Trust me.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.293

13:48.428 --> 13:50.128
Did he just say Santa Claus?

13:50.263 --> 13:52.330
(muttering)

13:52.432 --> 13:56.701

Can I have a...

14:00.874 --> 14:03.174
(wrapper crinkling)

14:04.344 --> 14:05.844
May I help you?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.790
Yes. Yeah, we need the first
flight out to Aspen, please.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.881
I'm sorry, all flights
are cancelled right now.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.518
We have no clear idea when
we'll be able to fly anyone out.

14:16.923 --> 14:20.792
Listen, um, we're actually not
on vacation like everybody else.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.263
We have to get to Aspen
because our jobs depend on it.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.265
I'm sure you can understand.

14:27.334 --> 14:31.069
We can't stay in Indiana.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.610
Well then, you better start
wishing for a Christmas miracle.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.715
Smooth.

14:45.518 --> 14:49.087
(indistinct voice over speakers)

14:49.222 --> 14:50.455
No, I understand. Thank you.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.824
No vacancy there either.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.661
One more person tells me to
wish for a Christmas miracle

14:56.796 --> 14:57.796
I'm going to lose it.

14:57.831 --> 14:59.297
This is unbelievable.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.643
We're not going to get to Aspen,
we're going to lose our jobs.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.433
I'm not losing anything.
Let me tell you.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.403
That lady was right.
We need a Christmas miracle.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.905
There's no such thing
as miracles!

15:07.040 --> 15:08.484
Jenna:
It's nice to be positive
during the holidays.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.628
Kevin:
There's no such thing!

15:09.676 --> 15:11.075
Okay?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.211
Well.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.579
I haven't seen such big frowns

15:14.714 --> 15:17.081
since the Christmas
with no snow.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.617
Here.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.687
Thanks.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.424
So, what seems to be
the problem here?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.092
Oh, you don't have to
worry about it.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.427
Our plane was grounded

15:29.562 --> 15:30.973
and we don't have anywhere
to go or stay.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.530
But, you know,
we'll figure it out.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.599
Well, that's quite
a frosty pickle.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.401
That's one way of putting it.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.180
Do you happen to know of
any hotels in the area

15:38.204 --> 15:40.805
that would have vacancy
this close to Christmas?

15:40.907 --> 15:44.475
Funny you should ask, my husband
and I own a small inn in town.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.844
If you need a place to sleep
and a warm meal,

15:46.980 --> 15:51.115
I assure you we are
the coziest place around.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.284
Oh, that just sounds...

15:53.386 --> 15:54.452
Miraculous.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.020
(chuckling)

15:56.156 --> 15:58.022
Oh, there's Chris now.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.524
Oh, what have we here, my petal?

15:59.626 --> 16:03.094
These kids need a place
to stay for the night.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.029
And I don't think
I know your names.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.431
How rude of me.
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.033
I'm Jenna Hudson,
I'm a writer from New York.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.903
Well, I'm not from New York but
I went to NYU for journalism...

16:12.038 --> 16:13.471
She asked for your name.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.606
Not your resume.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.540
Columbia.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.041
Hi, guys. I'm Kevin.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.476
Hi, Kevin.

16:18.578 --> 16:22.146
Well, I'm Carol Winters
and this my husband Chris.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.148
Wonderful to meet you both.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.719
We'd be delighted
to have you stay with us.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.021
Absolutely.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.456
No excuses.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.436
We should be going though,
it's going to be dark soon.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.194
I'll go fetch Rudolph.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.495
Like the reindeer?

16:37.630 --> 16:38.630
Oh, don't be silly.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.165
It's what we call our car.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.703
Ah.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.660
Welcome to the Winters Inn.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.763
Oh, wow.

17:12.866 --> 17:13.998
Kevin:
How old is this place?

17:14.067 --> 17:17.068
It's been standing tall
since 1832.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.137
Look at the detail
in that mahogany.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.638
That stained glass window.

17:21.775 --> 17:24.041
My goodness, this could be
the work of Louis David.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.343
Who?

17:25.444 --> 17:27.089
I've always admired
Georgian homes, you know,

17:27.113 --> 17:30.248
they're so symmetrical
and balanced.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.184
Well, somebody knows
their architecture.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.619
You're such a suck up.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.399
I have a subscription to
Architecture Digest, sue me.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.489
You kids must be tired,
we'll get your room ready.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.559
Lucky for you, the Mistletoe
Suite is available for tonight.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.593
What?

17:42.695 --> 17:43.928
Oh, no, no, no.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.329
No, we can't.
We're not together.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.464
I would never ever.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.465
Jenna:
Oh, my god.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.933
Oh, uh, well then,

17:49.035 --> 17:51.069
why are you travelling together
for the holidays?

17:51.204 --> 17:52.503
We're on assignment.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.083
We're both writers for
Epiphany Magazine.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.240
Yeah, I'm supposed to be
in Aspen right now

17:56.376 --> 17:57.987
in a luxury chalet writing
a heartfelt Christmas piece.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.188
I'm supposed to be boarding knee
deep in powder

17:59.212 --> 18:00.645
at a legendary mountain.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.324
And then I was going to have
a holiday cooking cuisine class

18:02.348 --> 18:03.692
with a triple Michelin-star
chef, which is very exciting.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.982
There's a natural spa
actually.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.328
I don't think there's
any natural spas in Aspen.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.185
Appointment at the springs.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.686
My mistake.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.028
I'll put you in separate rooms.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.223
They'll have to be
side by side though.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.325
Can you two manage that?

18:13.359 --> 18:14.492
Oh, yes.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.829
Yeah, yeah. That's perfect.
Thank you.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.171
(knocking)

18:27.340 --> 18:28.340
Oh, hi.

18:28.374 --> 18:29.540
Will this do?

18:29.676 --> 18:31.242
Oh, Carol, thank you.
It's perfect.

18:31.377 --> 18:34.378
There are complimentary pyjamas
in the drawer if needed.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.758
And the bell will ring
at 8:00 in the morning

18:35.782 --> 18:37.348
for breakfast downstairs.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.418
Well, great. I think I'll be
up and about well before 8:00.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.586
Very well.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.555
I'll see you then.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.624
(knocking)
Knock knock.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.594
You know, you could actually
knock like a normal person.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.062
(laughing)

18:51.197 --> 18:52.430
What?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.065
You laugh now, huh?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.834
It's like I'm in
a bed full of bunnies.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.703
Wait 'til you try yours on.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.205
It's like I'm wearing nothing.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.840
But I'm not.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.153
You really have a way
of putting things

19:04.177 --> 19:06.777
so even a two-year-old
can understand.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.947
I have my own pyjamas,
thank you.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.550
Not a lot of light in here, huh?

19:12.685 --> 19:13.885
I like it.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.154
My bed's softer than yours.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.790
Is there something you needed?

19:19.926 --> 19:21.325
No, I just wanted to know

19:21.427 --> 19:22.771
if you wanted some help
unpacking your broom and cape.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.762
Goodnight, Kevin.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.865
Goodnight, Jenna.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.471
Mm.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.908
Well, well, look who
came late to breakfast.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.143
Yes, I slept in.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.545
Haven't slept in
since I was a child.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.415
Sounds like the saddest thing
I've heard in my entire life.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.684
Have you looked outside yet?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.919
Looks like we're living in
an Indiana snow globe.

20:22.055 --> 20:22.920
Yeah.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.288
With no way out.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.824
Yes, that's what a snow globe
is, you're stuck inside.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.759
What is your issue
with Indiana anyway?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.295
Maybe that it's not
a luxury chalet in Aspen

20:31.397 --> 20:33.698
surrounded by beautiful
snowcap mountains?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.366
(gasping)

20:35.468 --> 20:36.667
Thank you, Carol.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.902
We might not be Aspen

20:38.004 --> 20:40.071
but there's no place
like the Winters Inn.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.539
You'll see.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.008
Well, you're lucky to be here
for our last Christmas

20:44.110 --> 20:45.710
before we close.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.645
Oh, you're closing? Why?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.013
Oh, dear.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.748
The developers have been
threatening

20:50.883 --> 20:54.218
to shut us down for years
to build a big luxury hotel.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.354
You're still here.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.954
Mmhmm, sure.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.258
Since this place has been
designated as an historic site

21:00.393 --> 21:01.225
it can never get approval.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.860
What happened?

21:02.962 --> 21:07.365
They made a case that the man
who founded this inn in 1832

21:07.467 --> 21:09.400
is a fictional character.

21:09.502 --> 21:13.337
And therefore the building
has no historical significance.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.745
Who founded it?

21:20.880 --> 21:24.215
Well, the great Saint Nick,
of course.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.420
I'm...

21:29.522 --> 21:33.157
So sorry to hear
that's happening to you.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.493
Is there anything
that can save your inn?

21:35.595 --> 21:40.431
Only if we can prove that it is
a national historic landmark.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.432
Good morning, my dear.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.501
Oh.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.434
Good morning, you two.
Morning.

21:43.569 --> 21:44.635
Morning, Chris.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.971
Um, any word on those flights?

21:47.106 --> 21:49.507
Looks like the snow is
disappearing and we really...

21:49.642 --> 21:51.020
We should get started,
we should go.

21:51.044 --> 21:53.344
The blizzard is still in
full effect in Colorado.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.380
There are no flights
in or out of Aspen.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.182
You got to be kidding.
What?

21:58.318 --> 22:00.818
On the bright side,
all this fresh show is perfect

22:00.920 --> 22:02.953
for our sleigh rides
this afternoon.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.388
Jenna:
That's very sweet.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.657
So, you're saying
there's no way into Colorado?

22:06.759 --> 22:07.759
I can't drive there.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.327
There must be another way
to Aspen.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.507
A private airport. There's a lot
of rich people in Aspen.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.609
It's a great idea. What, are you
going to charter your own jet?

22:13.633 --> 22:14.943
Did I say I was going to
charter a jet?

22:14.967 --> 22:16.407
It sounded like you meant that,
yeah.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.936
Why don't you and your pancakes
mind your own business?

22:19.038 --> 22:20.237
Okay, fine.
Yeah.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.450
We'll just sit over here and
enjoy our carbs.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.707
Okay, okay, okay.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.009
I'm sorry, you two,
it looks like you're snowed in.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.885
You're snowed in?!

22:35.021 --> 22:36.198
Jenna:
<i>Yeah, there's no way in or out.</i>

22:36.222 --> 22:37.688
<i>This is a disaster.</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:39.824
<i>I need your pieces
uploaded the site</i>

22:39.926 --> 22:42.626
by 9:00am on Christmas Day.

22:42.762 --> 22:43.972
What am I supposed to
publish now?

22:43.996 --> 22:46.630
I know.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.799
And where did you guys
say you were again?

22:48.935 --> 22:50.735
Indiana.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.304
It's Santa Claus, Indiana
to be specific,

22:53.439 --> 22:54.739
and there's a lovely couple

22:54.907 --> 22:56.352
who's let us stay at their
beautiful historic inn.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.442
It's decorated like
Santa's Village in here.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.443
Because it's Christmas time.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.478
I mean, what is wrong with you?

23:00.580 --> 23:01.445
Would you look at this place?

23:01.581 --> 23:03.180
<i>Okay, wait a second.</i>

23:03.316 --> 23:04.827
Did you just tell me that
your plane landed

23:04.851 --> 23:08.386
in a town called Santa Claus
one week before Christmas?

23:08.521 --> 23:09.620
Yeah.

23:09.756 --> 23:10.799
Why do you make this
sound like it's a good thing?

23:10.823 --> 23:11.655
Because it is a good thing!

23:11.758 --> 23:13.958
You guys, you need to stay!

23:14.060 --> 23:15.593
<i>There's a story there,
I can feel it.</i>

23:15.695 --> 23:16.894
Simone, okay.

23:17.029 --> 23:17.895
I have spent weeks
organizing my research.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.331
<i>(crosstalking angrily)</i>

23:20.466 --> 23:23.801
Will you please be quiet,
both of you, and figure it out?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.870
<i>Or find another job.</i>

23:25.972 --> 23:27.271
Now, I thought I'd taught you

23:27.373 --> 23:29.940
that the heart of being
a good journalist

23:30.042 --> 23:33.110
is finding the extraordinary
in the ordinary.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.278
So, find it!

23:34.380 --> 23:35.380
Wait! Simone!
Simone!

23:35.415 --> 23:36.280
<i>(crosstalking)</i>

23:36.416 --> 23:37.748
Guys, uh, guys?

23:37.817 --> 23:39.383
Merry Christmas.
<i>Wait!</i>

23:39.485 --> 23:40.985
All right? Bye.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.687
Oh, gosh. They get on my nerves.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.362
Don't you just love
decorating the Christmas tree?

23:51.497 --> 23:52.696
Yes.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.733
It brings people together
in such a special way.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.501
How about you, Kevin?

23:57.603 --> 23:59.548
Did your family decorate
the Christmas tree together

23:59.572 --> 24:00.638
when you were a kid?

24:00.740 --> 24:04.208
Uh, my dad would take us
Christmas camping.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.143
Christmas camping outside?

24:06.245 --> 24:08.078
No, no, no, no, we, uh...

24:08.214 --> 24:11.682
we'd camp out in the living room
in front of the Christmas tree

24:11.818 --> 24:12.983
after we decorated.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.086
We'd, um, just keep
the tree lights on

24:16.189 --> 24:17.399
and eat Christmas
caramel popcorn

24:17.423 --> 24:19.323
and my dad would read us
Christmas stories

24:19.459 --> 24:21.358
until we fell asleep.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.727
Oh, Kevin,
that sounds beautiful.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.095
You dad sounds amazing.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.932
Yeah. He's the best.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.268
How about you, Jenna?

24:31.370 --> 24:33.671
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.707
We had plenty of great
Christmas traditions.

24:36.809 --> 24:40.544
Um, my mom used to make
this peppermint hot chocolate

24:40.646 --> 24:42.357
that all the neighbourhood kids
went crazy for.

24:42.381 --> 24:45.182
And we made homemade
marshmallows.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.318
And, uh, on Christmas eve

24:47.453 --> 24:49.631
my parents would set our
stockings at the end of the bed,

24:49.655 --> 24:53.457
and then early in the morning
we would wake up and have,

24:53.559 --> 24:57.261
you know, something to open
before...

24:57.396 --> 24:59.363
everybody else.

25:03.336 --> 25:06.103
You okay over there, Jenna,
you look a little frazzled?

25:12.545 --> 25:14.578
Nothing, I'm fine.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.549
Thank you.

25:40.273 --> 25:41.483
Don't tell me
you're reading about this place

25:41.507 --> 25:43.440
when you could be outside
experiencing it.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.810
Yes, I think it's important
to know the history.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.045
What did you find outside?

25:48.180 --> 25:49.547
I found a great coffee spot.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.249
They roast their beans in house.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.852
Came across a couple local kids
tobogganing.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.388
Took their saucer down a hill,
it was electrifying.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.290
Sounds terrifying.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.892
You never tobogganed as a kid?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.260
No, never.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.963
So, what are you, uh,
what did you find in your book?

26:06.098 --> 26:08.076
I'm not going to tell you.
Go do your own research.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.500
What do you think this is, huh?

26:09.602 --> 26:10.901
I think that's coffee.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.336
Show me your research.

26:12.471 --> 26:13.471
Let's see it.

26:13.539 --> 26:14.772
It's all up here.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.474
I can't believe
you're my competition.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.977
Come on, no, no. Tell me.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.647
Tell me one fact
you learned in your book.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.749
No.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.451
Pretty please.

26:27.553 --> 26:30.421
Okay.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.724
The legend is two centuries ago

26:33.826 --> 26:37.227
old Saint Nick crashed his
sleigh here one Christmas Eve

26:37.330 --> 26:40.364
after delivering Christmas
presents but he liked it so much

26:40.466 --> 26:42.633
he decided to stay
and make it his home.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.335
The North Pole was
too conspicuous?

26:44.437 --> 26:48.839
Apparently it's tradition now to
look up in the sky at midnight

26:48.908 --> 26:50.508
on Christmas Eve
and see a golden streak.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.242
A golden streak?

26:52.345 --> 26:53.855
Yes, it's a dash of
the Christmas spirit

26:53.879 --> 26:55.123
marking the end of Christmas Eve

26:55.147 --> 26:56.814
and the beginning of
Christmas Day.

26:56.916 --> 27:01.185
Oh, and, um, only those who
believe will be able to see it.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.486
Hm.

27:02.622 --> 27:03.520
Sounds like you're wasting
your time.

27:03.623 --> 27:06.323
It's magical, right?

27:06.459 --> 27:08.659
You know Santa Claus
isn't real, right?

27:10.363 --> 27:11.528
Yes!

27:11.631 --> 27:12.808
You just asked me
what I was reading.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.565
Because I wanted facts.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.467
I didn't want some
ridiculous fairy-tale.

27:16.569 --> 27:17.879
Well, I happen to think
this is interesting.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.370
Forget it. Jeez.

27:19.505 --> 27:20.771
All right.
Yeah.

27:20.906 --> 27:21.739
Hey!

27:21.874 --> 27:23.307
Sharing is caring.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.276
What, did your father not
teach you any manners as a kid?

27:29.482 --> 27:31.382
My father taught me everything.

27:31.517 --> 27:34.785
Well, he skipped over
common decency.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.453
You're just upset

27:36.589 --> 27:38.100
because you know that I'm going
to find a better story here

27:38.124 --> 27:41.125
and you're going to start
the new year off unemployed.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.127
You've got some nerve, pal.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.262
Pal?
Yes!

27:44.296 --> 27:45.663
And you know what else?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.542
You're really lucky you don't
believe in Santa Claus

27:47.566 --> 27:51.735
because you would be getting
coal for being this irritating.

27:53.539 --> 27:54.738
(scoffing)

27:54.874 --> 27:57.141
Irritating?

28:00.980 --> 28:03.847
Jenna:
Carol, tell me about living in
Santa Claus, Indiana.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.827
What's your favourite part about
being here during the holidays?

28:05.851 --> 28:08.652
Are there any traditions
everyone participates in?

28:08.788 --> 28:12.322
Certainly our Christmas Eve
festival here at the Inn.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.658
We all gather here, sing carols,

28:14.794 --> 28:17.828
and we dance and we eat
the most delicious treats.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.229
That sounds fantastic.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.998
It's enchanting.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.866
I'm going to miss it next year.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.868
I'm so sorry they're
closing this place down.

28:24.970 --> 28:28.205
It would sure take a Christmas
miracle to save it now.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.847
Carol.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.117
That's it.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.517
What's what, dear?

28:40.653 --> 28:43.287
I'm going to write my article
on saving your inn.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.622
It's going to be a story of
hope and redemption

28:45.758 --> 28:48.459
and Christmas spirit and
everything Simone wants.

28:48.594 --> 28:52.396
Oh, you're very sweet, but it'll
be hard to find any proof.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.098
No, no, no. I'm a journalist.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.099
And I'm a good one.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.700
Research is what I do.

28:56.836 --> 28:59.970
I just wouldn't want you to
get your hopes up, Jenna.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.105
No.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.573
Anything is possible
at Christmas!

29:02.675 --> 29:03.540
Right.

29:03.676 --> 29:04.374
Let's do this.

29:04.477 --> 29:06.643
Cheers.

Is all this mail for you, Chris?

29:46.786 --> 29:48.085
We're the only town in the world

29:48.187 --> 29:49.664
whose post office
bears the name Santa Claus,

29:49.688 --> 29:51.399
so the town gets thousands of
letters every Christmas

No one else in town knew

43:22.934 --> 43:24.767
And unpredictable.

43:24.903 --> 43:27.570
That sounds awful.

43:27.706 --> 43:30.373
(laughing)

43:30.508 --> 43:32.375
Have you ever been in love?

43:32.544 --> 43:35.378
Um. (Clearing throat)

43:37.282 --> 43:38.948
Does Kelly Kapowski count?

43:39.050 --> 43:40.617
No.

43:40.719 --> 43:42.986
(laughing)

43:44.422 --> 43:47.924
Look, I could jump out of
a plane at 12,000 feet.

43:49.928 --> 43:53.763
But falling in love, like,
really, really falling in love...

43:55.033 --> 43:58.067
Scares the hell out of me.

44:00.338 --> 44:03.106
Finally something
we have in common.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.277
Well, thank you.

44:08.380 --> 44:10.246
I should be, uh, getting to bed.

44:10.348 --> 44:12.548
I have a lot of research to do
in the morning.

44:12.651 --> 44:13.916
Yep.

44:14.052 --> 44:15.451
Goodnight.

44:15.587 --> 44:17.520
Night.

44:18.757 --> 44:20.890
Hey, wait.

44:22.127 --> 44:25.995
Uh, you want to
get some fresh air?

44:26.097 --> 44:29.065
It's two o'clock in the morning.

44:33.438 --> 44:37.840
So, what else are you afraid of?

44:37.976 --> 44:40.977
You mean besides being
stuck in Indiana with you?

44:45.316 --> 44:50.253
I... I write about what I'm
afraid of to get over my fears.

44:52.157 --> 44:55.692
Like what? Like, what's the
scariest thing you've ever done?

44:57.062 --> 45:00.630
By far, swimming with Great
White Sharks in New Zealand.

45:00.732 --> 45:03.066
Oh, yeah. I remember that
article. It was so great.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.802
My heart was racing so fast
I could hardly finish it.

45:07.305 --> 45:10.373
How about your article about
saving the Great Barrier Reef?

45:10.508 --> 45:12.642
That was amazing.

45:12.777 --> 45:14.777
You read one of my articles?

45:14.879 --> 45:18.781
Well, yeah, I've read them all.

45:21.019 --> 45:23.453
You're an amazing writer.

45:25.657 --> 45:27.056
Really?

45:27.192 --> 45:29.258
You think so?

45:31.129 --> 45:33.196
Why do you think
I've been such a baby

45:33.331 --> 45:35.765
about being paired up with you
as my competition?

45:39.370 --> 45:43.239
Wow, that's really funny
how things turn out.

45:44.542 --> 45:46.476
What do you mean?

45:48.379 --> 45:51.748
We've worked together in the
same office for all these years

45:51.883 --> 45:54.984
and only had
a real conversation now.

45:57.889 --> 46:01.190
I always thought
you didn't know who I was.

46:03.528 --> 46:06.162
I felt really invisible
in that office sometimes.

46:06.264 --> 46:09.065
You felt invisible?

46:10.502 --> 46:13.936
I noticed you the first day
you walked into that office.

46:15.940 --> 46:20.076
If anything, I thought
you were ignoring me.

46:20.211 --> 46:22.845
(laughing)

46:22.947 --> 46:24.147
Well.

46:24.249 --> 46:25.593
There's one thing
I can say about you, Kevin,

46:25.617 --> 46:28.251
it's that you're
impossible to ignore.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.924
That's true.

46:40.765 --> 46:44.901
Jenna:
Do you guys remember ever seeing
a certificate from the 1930s?

46:45.036 --> 46:47.236
It really would be the golden
ticket to saving this inn.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.038
It's an historical
legal document

46:49.174 --> 46:51.073
the developers could not
argue against.

46:51.209 --> 46:52.074
You have any idea
where it could be?

46:52.210 --> 46:53.543
Oh, that.

46:53.678 --> 46:56.579
Last time I saw that, Theodore
Roosevelt was president.

46:59.017 --> 47:01.050
Jenna:
I'm on a really tight deadline.

47:01.152 --> 47:02.919
I was doing some research
and, well,

47:03.021 --> 47:04.353
it's a certificate that I need

47:04.489 --> 47:06.422
in order to write my piece
about saving the inn.

47:06.524 --> 47:08.958
It's exactly the kind of story
our readers need right now.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.193
It would fill them with hope

47:10.328 --> 47:13.596
and belief in
the magic of the season.

47:13.731 --> 47:14.597
It's the perfect
Christmas story.

47:14.732 --> 47:15.965
Good morning, everyone.

47:16.100 --> 47:16.966
Morning.
Morning.

47:17.101 --> 47:18.201
Hello, good morning.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.436
Chris:
What's on the agenda today, son?

47:20.572 --> 47:22.805
You know somewhere
we can rent a car?

47:22.941 --> 47:24.473
Rent a car?
Where are you going?

47:24.609 --> 47:25.942
Is this for research?

47:26.077 --> 47:27.721
'Cause you know Simone wants us
to stay here and write.

47:27.745 --> 47:29.145
You know,

47:29.214 --> 47:31.374
actually I was thinking
you might want to come with me.

47:31.416 --> 47:33.482
Why?

47:33.585 --> 47:35.518
It's a secret.

47:36.821 --> 47:38.321
Well, I can't.

47:38.423 --> 47:39.767
I really need to continue
researching and finish writing.

47:39.791 --> 47:41.490
We only have three days left.

47:41.626 --> 47:43.759
Oh, don't be silly, Jenna.

47:43.862 --> 47:44.760
You've lots of time.

47:44.863 --> 47:46.395
You can borrow Rudolph.

47:46.531 --> 47:49.699
I think it'd be good for you
both to go out for the day.

47:49.834 --> 47:52.068
Kevin:
Thanks, guys.

47:55.907 --> 47:58.040
All right.

48:01.779 --> 48:02.912

48:19.998 --> 48:21.063

It is.

48:37.181 --> 48:39.916
We're going to see my family.

48:41.052 --> 48:43.352
Your family?

48:43.521 --> 48:44.521
Like your...

48:44.622 --> 48:46.889
What kind of family?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.826
My immediate family.

48:50.929 --> 48:52.395
You grew up in Indi...

48:52.497 --> 48:53.874
You grew up in Indiana, we've
been hanging out for three days,

48:53.898 --> 48:55.075
didn't think once
to mention that.

48:55.099 --> 48:56.332
You know what?

48:56.434 --> 48:58.078
I heard you talking
to your sister on the phone

48:58.102 --> 48:59.246
and you lied to her, you told
her that you were in Aspen.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.270
Why did you do that?

49:00.305 --> 49:01.103
The walls are thin.

49:01.239 --> 49:02.605
What's going on?

49:02.740 --> 49:04.218
It's complicated.
Don't give me it's complicated.

49:04.242 --> 49:05.386
You brought me
all the way out here.

49:05.410 --> 49:06.776
There was no reason
to tell you.

49:06.878 --> 49:08.811
What is the deal?

49:10.281 --> 49:12.148
My dad passed away
three years ago.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.416
Suddenly.

49:13.518 --> 49:15.685
And I never had
the chance to say goodbye.

49:18.957 --> 49:21.157
I haven't come back
for Christmas since.

49:21.926 --> 49:24.060
I'm sorry.

49:25.229 --> 49:27.964
So, you haven't seen your family
in three years?

49:28.066 --> 49:31.000
No, no, no. I see my family
all the time.

49:32.470 --> 49:33.903
I love them.

49:34.038 --> 49:37.873
My niece, Tori, she's the cutest
thing you'd ever want to see.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.143
It's just...

49:41.245 --> 49:44.680
The thought of spending the
holidays without him is...

49:44.782 --> 49:47.350
Yeah.

49:47.452 --> 49:49.652
I get that.

49:51.022 --> 49:53.656
And that's why you wanted
the Aspen assignment so bad.

50:05.636 --> 50:06.535
Hooray, we're here.

How are you?

50:41.039 --> 50:41.937

What's going, stranger?
How's it going, man?

51:03.161 --> 51:04.271
It's good to see you, good to
see you, great to see you.

Hi. Jenna. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

51:07.331 --> 51:09.009
Nice to meet you. Beautiful
lady. Congrats, man.

51:09.033 --> 51:09.932
Congrats.

51:10.034 --> 51:11.467
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

51:11.602 --> 51:12.679
We just work together at the
magazine, we're coworkers.

51:12.703 --> 51:15.237
Oh, of course. Okay, of course.

All right.

51:16.307 --> 51:18.474
Who's hungry?

51:19.644 --> 51:21.055
Do you put honey on your
mashed potatoes?

51:21.079 --> 51:22.745
Honey?

51:22.880 --> 51:23.913
That smells amazing.

51:24.048 --> 51:25.114
Thanks.

51:25.216 --> 51:27.783
It's a two-hour meal,
so I would hope so.

51:27.885 --> 51:29.885
Can you help me
put this on the tree?

51:30.021 --> 51:31.520
Oh, yeah. I would love to.

51:31.622 --> 51:33.089

51:36.694 --> 51:38.894
We know, man. We know.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.135
Put it there.

51:46.304 --> 51:47.314
Are you two writing together?

51:47.338 --> 51:48.871
Simone has us on
separate pieces.

51:49.006 --> 51:50.918
We each have to write something
about Christmas magic.

51:50.942 --> 51:55.444
It's actually an experiment to
see who the readers like more.

51:55.546 --> 51:56.278
It's not ideal.

51:56.414 --> 51:58.247
So, you two are competitors?

51:58.416 --> 52:00.883
Uh, it's a cutthroat industry.
You know?

52:00.952 --> 52:03.052
And we had no choice.

52:03.154 --> 52:05.287
Wendy:
So, what angles
are you both taking?

52:05.423 --> 52:07.089
That's a good question, Mom.
Yeah.

52:07.191 --> 52:08.057
You should tell them, I'm sure
they'd be really interested

52:08.192 --> 52:09.470
in hearing what you have to say.

52:09.494 --> 52:10.904
I'd really like to know,
I think the whole...

52:10.928 --> 52:12.394
You've been doing
so much research.

52:12.530 --> 52:14.208
You guys aren't telling each
other what you're writing about,

52:14.232 --> 52:15.232
are you?

52:15.366 --> 52:16.499
No.

52:16.634 --> 52:18.200
Maybe not.

52:18.302 --> 52:19.942
Mine's not really
coming together anyways,

52:20.037 --> 52:21.137
so there's not much to say.

52:21.205 --> 52:22.271
How's your coming, Kev?

52:22.373 --> 52:23.405
I haven't started yet.

Of course you haven't.

52:24.842 --> 52:26.286
I never start writing
until the last day

52:26.310 --> 52:27.888
just in case something
more inspiring comes along.

52:27.912 --> 52:29.089

your craft, that's why.

52:29.113 --> 52:30.613
