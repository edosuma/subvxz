WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.375
ORSON'S SECRET CAME OUT.

00:04.375 --> 00:07.708
SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
YOUR HUSBAND TRIED TO KILL MIKE?

00:07.708 --> 00:11.382
AND BREE COULDN'T FORGIVE HIM.

00:11.382 --> 00:13.144
LYNETTE'S STEPDAUGHTER KAYLA...

00:13.144 --> 00:17.048
(screaming)
 NEVER ADJUSTED TO BEING PART
OF THEIR FAMILY...

00:17.048 --> 00:20.151
BUT I'M NEVER GONNA LOVE HER,
AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

00:20.151 --> 00:23.524
AND DYLAN RECONNECTED
WITH HER REAL FATHER.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.526
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITHYOU,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.358
BUT IF YOUR MOM
IS STILL SCARED OF ME,

00:27.358 --> 00:29.460
I DON'T WANNA UPSET HER
AGAIN.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.362
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL HER.

00:37.568 --> 00:40.271
(Mary Alice)
IT HAPPENS IN EVERY MARRIAGE.

00:40.271 --> 00:44.575
COUPLES ACCUMULATE
LOVELY THINGS--

00:44.575 --> 00:49.220
THINGS THAT MAKE A HOUSE
A HOME.

00:49.220 --> 00:54.054
BUT WHEN THE HOME IS BROKEN,
THESE THINGS MUST BE DIVIDED.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.527
THE MOST DIGNIFIED WAY
TO DO THIS

00:56.527 --> 00:58.229
IS FOR EACH SPOUSE

00:58.229 --> 01:02.133
TO KEEP WHAT IS
MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM.

01:02.133 --> 01:05.836
AND BREE AND ORSON HODGE
WERE NOTHING...

01:05.836 --> 01:08.169
IF NOT DIGNIFIED.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.671
I ASSUME YOU'LL WANT
THE PEWTER CAT.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.643
THAT WAS MY GIFT TO YOU.

01:12.643 --> 01:14.645
YOU ADORED IT, AS I RECALL.

01:14.645 --> 01:17.208
THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING YOU
THE CHOICE.

01:19.410 --> 01:22.583
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT HUMMEL
FROM YOUR AUNT?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.084
IT'S UGLY AS SIN,

01:24.084 --> 01:26.517
BUT SHE INSISTS
THAT IT'S VALUABLE.

01:26.517 --> 01:29.120
YOU KEEP IT.
KEEP EVERYTHING.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.422
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
IN THIS HOUSE THAT I WANT.

01:31.422 --> 01:33.794
I KNOW, BUT I'M THE ONE THING
YOU CAN'T HAVE.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.197
PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.199
ORSON,
EVERY WIFE UNDERSTANDS

01:38.199 --> 01:40.431
THAT HER HUSBAND
WILL MAKE A FEW MISTAKES--

01:40.431 --> 01:43.134
A FORGOTTEN ANNIVERSARY,
THE OCCASIONAL HARSH WORD,

01:43.134 --> 01:45.436
BUT WE ALL HAVE TO
DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE,

01:45.436 --> 01:47.608
AND I'M DRAWING MINE
AT THE ATTEMPTED MURDER

01:47.608 --> 01:49.610
OF MY BEST FRIEND'S HUSBAND.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.612
BREE, IF I COULD OPEN UP
MY HEART

01:51.612 --> 01:55.386
AND SHOW YOU HOW SORRY I AM,
I WOULD, BUT I CAN'T.

01:55.386 --> 01:58.149
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE
I COULD DO.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.794
THERE IS ONE THING.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.856
NAME IT.

02:05.856 --> 02:07.898
TURN YOURSELF IN
TO THE POLICE.

02:07.898 --> 02:10.830
BUT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
HASN'T RUN OUT.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.633
THEY WOULD ARREST ME.

02:12.633 --> 02:16.267
AND YOU'D PROBABLY
GO TO PRISON.
 YES, I COULD GO AWAY
FOR YEARS.

02:16.267 --> 02:19.270
EXACTLY, AND IF YOU COULD MUSTER
THAT KIND OF MORAL COURAGE,

02:19.270 --> 02:22.273
I THINK
I COULD FORGIVE YOU.

02:22.273 --> 02:24.715
OH, COME ON.

02:24.715 --> 02:27.378
I PROMISE
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.322
BREE...

02:31.322 --> 02:33.924
I CAN'T GO TO PRISON.

02:36.627 --> 02:39.190
VERY WELL.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.165
SO DO YOU WANT THE CAT
OR NOT?

02:45.165 --> 02:48.299
IN ANY SEPARATION,
IT'S ONLY FAIR

02:48.299 --> 02:52.543
THAT EACH SPOUSE GET TO KEEP
WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM.

02:55.276 --> 03:00.311
THAT'S HOW BREE HODGE
GOT TO KEEP HER PEWTER CAT...

03:00.311 --> 03:04.215
AND ORSON HODGE GOT
TO HOLD ON TO...

03:04.215 --> 03:06.857
HIS FREEDOM.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.233
THE SUBURBS ARE FLUSH
WITH A CERTAIN KIND OF FOOL.

03:22.233 --> 03:24.435
YOU KNOW THE TYPE--

03:24.435 --> 03:27.608
THE MAN WHO OPENS HIS DOOR
TO TOTAL STRANGERS...

03:27.608 --> 03:32.683
THE WOMAN WHO NEVER
USES HER LATCH.

03:32.683 --> 03:34.985
IT NEVER OCCURS TO THEM

03:34.985 --> 03:37.918
THAT LETTING SOMEONE
INTO THEIR HOME...

03:37.918 --> 03:42.393
MEANS LETTING THEM
INTO THEIR LIVES.

03:42.393 --> 03:45.296
HI. I'M ELLIE. I UNDERSTAND
YOU GOT A ROOM TO RENT.

03:45.296 --> 03:47.398
YEAH, COME ON IN.

03:47.398 --> 03:49.229
SO BECAUSE OF
MY HUSBAND'S DISABILITY,

03:49.229 --> 03:51.562
OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION
HAS CHANGED,

03:51.562 --> 03:53.634
AND WE HAVE THIS BIG HOUSE.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.637
WELL, IT'S AN AMAZING PLACE,
AND I LOVE THE ROOM.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.709
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S STILL AVAILABLE.

03:58.709 --> 04:02.343
WELL, YOU KNOW... ANYHOW, UH,
YOU HAVE A GREAT CREDIT SCORE.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.545
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT WAS THAT?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.547
WHAT WAS WHAT?

04:06.547 --> 04:09.980
ELLIE, DID SHE JUST GIVE ME
A DIRTY LOOK?

04:09.980 --> 04:11.382
UH...

04:11.382 --> 04:14.355
YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.656
I'M SORRY, ELLIE.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.488
THERE'S BEEN SOME TENSION
BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND ME.

04:18.488 --> 04:21.492
SEE, THE TRUTH IS, WE COULD'VE
HAD THE ROOM RENTED BY NOW

04:21.492 --> 04:23.734
IF MY HUSBAND
WASN'T SOPARANOID.

04:23.734 --> 04:27.738
WHY, BECAUSE I WOULDN'T LET
THE SWEDISH BODYBUILDER MOVE IN?
 YOU'RE AS BLIND
AS A FRUIT BAT.

04:27.738 --> 04:29.640
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
IF HE'S A BODYBUILDER?

04:29.640 --> 04:33.444
I BRUSHED UP AGAINST HIM.
I FELT HIS BICEP. IT WAS HUGE.

04:33.444 --> 04:34.745
THAT WASN'T HIS BICEP.

04:34.745 --> 04:37.978
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE RUSHED OUT OF HERE?

04:37.978 --> 04:41.752
OKAY, I NORMALLY DIG THIS SORT
OF INTERPERSONAL STUFF,

04:41.752 --> 04:44.855
BUT I HAVE A CLASS IN 20,
SO BACK TO ME?

04:44.855 --> 04:46.357
YOU'RE RIGHT, ELLIE.

04:46.357 --> 04:49.520
MY HUSBAND WAS
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.523
SO A CLASS?
ARE YOU A TEACHER?
 ACTUALLY, I'M AN ART STUDENT.

04:52.523 --> 04:55.826
MY LIFE WAS WORKING PRETTY WELL,
AND SO I DECIDED TO JUNK IT

04:55.826 --> 04:59.900
AND LEARN HOW TO PAINT FRUIT.
IT'S, UH, STUPID, RIGHT?

04:59.900 --> 05:02.373
NO, IT'S GUTSY.

05:02.373 --> 05:04.805
WELL, WE LIKE YOU,
ELLIE,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.307
AND IF YOU HAVE
FIRST AND LAST MONTHS' RENT,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.940
WE'D LIKE YOU EVEN MORE.
 FANTASTIC.

05:09.940 --> 05:13.614
I JUST HIT THE BANK,
SO DO YOU MIND CASH?

05:13.614 --> 05:16.687
OH, NO, I LOVE CASH.
CASH AND I GOWAYBACK.

05:16.687 --> 05:18.919
SO ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS,

05:18.919 --> 05:21.622
OR DO YOU NEED
TO GROPE HER, TOO?

05:21.622 --> 05:24.395
SO THAT REALLY WASN'T
THE GUY'S ARM?

05:24.395 --> 05:26.397
IT HAD AN ELBOW.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.102
(dishes clattering)
 (Tom)
ISTHISTHE CLEAN PILE?

05:32.102 --> 05:33.834
'CAUSE I'M NOT SEEING IT!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.437
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO 'EM ALL AGAIN.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.840
THIS TIME,
USE A LITTLE ELBOW GREASE.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.341
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.044
THEY ARE NOT SUFFERING
ENOUGH FOR MY TASTE.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.418
ARE YOU SURE THAT WASHING DISHES
IS THE RIGHT PUNISHMENT?

05:47.418 --> 05:49.720
WELL, GEE, I'M KIND OF
AT A LOSS HERE, TOM.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.883
DR. SPOCK DIDN'T HAVE A CHAPTER
ON HOW TO PUNISH YOUR KIDS

05:52.883 --> 05:56.527
FOR BURNING DOWN A BUILDING.
 I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
WE'RE HANDLING THIS RIGHT.

05:56.527 --> 05:58.829
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE 'EM
TO THERAPY.

05:58.829 --> 06:00.831
TOM, THEY'RE NOT
SERIAL KILLERS.

06:00.831 --> 06:02.362
THEY'RE TWO LITTLE BOYS

06:02.362 --> 06:05.396
WHO WERE AFRAID THEIR PARENTS
WERE BREAKING UP.

06:05.396 --> 06:06.567
BUT STILL--

06:06.567 --> 06:08.569
NO. WE CAN HANDLE THIS
IN-HOUSE.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.742
WE CAN MAKE SURE THEY NEVER
DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.

06:11.742 --> 06:14.805
FINE.
WE'LL TRY IT YOUR WAY.

06:14.805 --> 06:16.547
BUT THIS NEXT MONTH

06:16.547 --> 06:19.510
IS GONNA BE LIKE BOOT CAMP
FOR THESE GUYS.

06:19.510 --> 06:22.082
(raises voice) THEY ARE GOING TO
BE CLEANING OUT THE GUTTERS,

06:22.082 --> 06:24.114
TAKING OUT THE TRASH,
MOWING THE LAWNS.

06:24.114 --> 06:26.116
WAIT A SECOND.
THOSE ARE YOUR CHORES.

06:26.116 --> 06:29.059
NO TIME TO TALK.
DINNER SHIFT'S STARTING.

06:29.059 --> 06:30.961
(door opens and shuts)

06:30.961 --> 06:33.424
OKAY, THIS IS THE PLACE.

06:33.424 --> 06:35.766
OH, HERE, LET ME THROW THAT
AWAY FOR YOU.

06:35.766 --> 06:38.469
NO, I'M NOT FINISHED
WITH IT.

06:38.469 --> 06:39.970
IT'S A LAMAZE CLASS.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.973
I GUARANTEE YOU I WILL NOT
BE THE ONLY WOMAN IN THERE

06:42.973 --> 06:44.835
HOLDING A CHIMICHANGA.
 (chuckles)

06:44.835 --> 06:47.177
(Susan)
WOW. IT'S ALL COUPLES.

06:47.177 --> 06:50.581
I WISH MIKE DIDN'T HAVE
THAT REHAB THING TONIGHT.

06:50.581 --> 06:52.513
DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY?
I CAN SKIP THE MOVIE.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.586
(mouth full) OH, NO,
THAT'S OKAY. I'LL BE FINE.

06:55.586 --> 06:57.588
OKAY. HAVE FUN.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.527
(sighs)

07:10.901 --> 07:13.133
QUIT EYEING IT.
I AIN'T SHARING.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.568
OKAY, DON'T TALK.
JUST LISTEN.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.570
REMEMBER LAST YEAR
WHEN I BROUGHT UP

07:19.570 --> 07:22.543
DAD'S NEW GIRLFRIEND,
AND YOU SAID YOU NEVER WANTED

07:22.543 --> 07:25.445
TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD
ABOUT ONE OF HIS SKANKS AGAIN?
 YEAH.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.549
OKAY, WELL, I JUST SPOTTED THEM
IN THE HALLWAY,

07:28.549 --> 07:31.181
AND THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

07:31.181 --> 07:34.124
OH... MY GOD.

07:34.124 --> 07:37.558
OKAY, YOU'RE ALL CAUGHT UP.
 HE GOT HIS SKANK PREGNANT,
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

07:37.558 --> 07:40.561
I TRIED, REMEMBER? I SAID,
"DAD AND MARISA ARE ABOUT TO--"

07:40.561 --> 07:42.533
AND THEN YOU STOPPED ME,
AND THEN YOU SAID,

07:42.533 --> 07:46.597
"TALK TO THE HAND," AND I SAID,
"NO ONE SAYS THAT ANYMORE"--
 OKAY, I GET IT.

07:46.597 --> 07:48.038
ONE MORE THING.
THEY'RE MARRIED. SEE YA.

07:48.038 --> 07:51.602
SUSIE Q.! WHAT A SMALL WORLD!

07:51.602 --> 07:53.473
LOOK HOW FAT YOU ARE.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.946
HELLO, KARL.

07:55.946 --> 07:59.009
MARISA, THIS IS SUSAN,
MY EX-WIFE.

07:59.009 --> 08:03.784
HELLO. IT'S SO NICE
TO FINALLY MEET... YOU.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.917
HONEY, I-I'M GONNA GO SIGN US IN
AND GET US A COUPLE MATS.

08:06.917 --> 08:09.660
OKAY.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.662
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

08:11.662 --> 08:14.525
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES WE'D END UP
HAVING MORE KIDS, HUH?

08:14.525 --> 08:17.067
ESPECIALLYYOU.
 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:17.067 --> 08:19.800
I'M JUST SAYING,
MOST EGGS YOUR AGE DON'T TAKE.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.501
POWER TOYOU.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.804
OKAY, CLEARLY,
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.036
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE YOUR CHILD BRIDE

08:26.036 --> 08:28.038
AND FIND ANOTHER CLASS?

08:28.038 --> 08:31.041
I KNOW. SHE'S YOUNG. MAKES YOU
WANNA HAVE WORK DONE, HUH?

08:31.041 --> 08:34.715
OR SHOULD I SAY,
 MOREWORK DONE?
 THE ONLY WORK I'VE HAD DONE

08:34.715 --> 08:37.748
WAS GETTING 185 POUNDS OF
UGLY FAT SUCKED OUT OF MY HOUSE.

08:37.748 --> 08:39.750
YOU'RE JEALOUS. I GET IT.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.052
SHE'S GORGEOUS, FUNNY,
A LAW PROFESSOR.

08:42.052 --> 08:46.557
OH, NO, NO, NO, TH-THOSE ARE NOT
THE LEGS OF A LAW PROFESSOR.

08:46.557 --> 08:48.559
NOT THAT SHE NEEDS TO WORK.

08:48.559 --> 08:50.561
I JUST MADE PARTNER
AT MY FIRM. THANKS.

08:50.561 --> 08:52.903
I KEEP TELLING HER,
"SLOW DOWN.

08:52.903 --> 08:55.265
"IF YOU NEED SOMETHING TO DO,

08:55.265 --> 08:58.839
WHY NOT OVERSEE THE REMODEL
OF OUR NEW SKI CHALET?"

08:58.839 --> 09:02.072
WELL, I BETTER GET BACK
TO MARISA.

09:02.072 --> 09:04.775
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE DRIPPING.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.188
BYE, MOM. I'M LEAVING.

09:18.188 --> 09:20.030
BE HOME BY 10:00.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.032
10:00?
BUT IT'S ALMOST 8:00 NOW.

09:22.032 --> 09:25.335
YES, AND IT'S ALSO
A SCHOOL NIGHT.
 (sighs)

09:25.335 --> 09:27.337
FINE.
INTRODUCE ME TO THIS BOY,

09:27.337 --> 09:30.971
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT
MAKING YOUR CURFEW LATER.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.973
YEAH,
MAYBE SOME OTHER NIGHT.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.946
SWEETIE, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
MEET HIM EVENTUALLY.

09:35.946 --> 09:39.109
IT'S JUST... I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I LIKE HIM YET.

09:39.109 --> 09:42.182
WHEN I DO, YOU CAN MEET HIM.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.314
I'LL BE HOME BY 10:00.

09:44.314 --> 09:46.116
(sighs)

09:46.116 --> 09:47.618
(front door shuts)

09:47.618 --> 09:50.020
HEY, DAD.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.321
HEY, PRINCESS.

09:51.321 --> 09:53.023
LET'S GO. I'M STARVING.

09:56.627 --> 09:59.930
HONEY, I CAN'T FIND
MY NAIL FILE. HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

09:59.930 --> 10:02.002
IS THAT SOME KIND
OF JOKE?

10:02.002 --> 10:05.375
OH, RIGHT. I KEEP FORGETTING
YOU'RE USELESS.

10:05.375 --> 10:08.138
I'M GONNA SEE
IF ELLIE HAS ONE.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.213
HEY, ELLIE,
YOU GOT A SEC?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.715
BE RIGHT THERE.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.216
(glass clinking)

10:16.216 --> 10:18.218
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.991
HEY, UM...
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:20.991 --> 10:22.993
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE... ENTERTAINING.

10:24.655 --> 10:26.727
HI. I'M GABY SOLIS.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.198
HEY.

10:28.198 --> 10:30.200
UM, SO WHAT DO YOU NEED?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.202
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT CAN WAIT.

10:32.202 --> 10:34.304
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.272
(lowered voice)
OKAY, THAT WAS WEIRD.

10:42.272 --> 10:43.844
WHAT?

10:43.844 --> 10:47.848
EARLIER TONIGHT, I SAW A GUY
COMING OUT OF ELLIE'S ROOM,

10:47.848 --> 10:49.850
SO I ASSUMED
IT WAS HER BOYFRIEND,

10:49.850 --> 10:52.683
BUT JUST NOW I CAUGHT HER
IN THERE WITH ANOTHER GUY.

10:52.683 --> 10:55.726
OKAY. SO WE HAVE TWO TRAMPS
LIVING IN OUR HOUSE.

10:55.726 --> 10:58.328
THAT WAS FOR THE "USELESS"
COMMENT, WASN'T IT?

10:58.328 --> 11:02.262
MM-HMM.
AND IT FELT GOOD.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.134
(door opens)

11:04.134 --> 11:06.837
OH, IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S LEAVING.

11:06.837 --> 11:08.839
I HOPE
IT'S NOT 'CAUSE OF ME.

11:08.839 --> 11:09.840
MM.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.142
MAYBE I SHOULD GO
APOLOGIZE.

11:17.908 --> 11:19.209
(front door shuts)

11:26.917 --> 11:29.219
OKAY, THERE MAY BE
TWO TRAMPS IN THIS HOUSE,

11:29.219 --> 11:31.922
BUT ONLY ONE OF 'EM
IS GETTING PAID.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.695
(lawn mower running
in distance)

11:35.695 --> 11:37.367
HEY, LYNETTE.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.830
IDA'S CAT GOT OUT AGAIN.
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM, HAVE YA?

11:39.830 --> 11:42.132
NO, SORRY.
I HOPE YOU FIND HIM.

11:42.132 --> 11:45.135
WELL, IF HE'S ANYTHING LIKE IDA,
HE'LL WANDER INTO MY HOUSE DRUNK

11:45.135 --> 11:47.377
THE NEXT TIME
"GUIDING LIGHT" IS ON.

11:47.377 --> 11:49.079
(lawn mower powers down)

11:49.079 --> 11:52.182
WAIT. HOLD ON.
I HAVE TO FIX THIS.

11:54.845 --> 11:57.347
THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.219
YEAH, I KNOW. I HATE HER.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.291
HOW COMESHE'SNOT
IN TROUBLE?

12:01.291 --> 12:04.294
BECAUSEWESTARTED THE FIRE,
YOU IDIOT,

12:04.294 --> 12:06.296
SO NOWWEHAVE
TO BE PUNISHED.

12:06.296 --> 12:09.499
I KNOW,
BUT IT WAS HER IDEA!
 BOYS?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.203
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.340
KAYLA?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.242
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.214
I GUESS.

12:24.214 --> 12:26.216
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

12:26.216 --> 12:30.480
AND I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH, OKAY?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.482
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

12:32.482 --> 12:35.185
WITH THE FIRE
AT RICK'S RESTAURANT?

12:35.185 --> 12:37.387
DID SOMEONE SAY I DID?

12:37.387 --> 12:40.230
I'M LOOKING FOR
A "YES" OR "NO" ANSWER HERE.

12:41.892 --> 12:44.264
I DIDN'T START THE FIRE.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.798
NO, THE TWINS DID,
BUT THEY SAY IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

12:47.798 --> 12:49.800
IT WAS A JOKE.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.302
I DIDN'T THINK
THEY'DACTUALLYDO IT.

12:52.302 --> 12:54.875
KAYLA...

12:54.875 --> 12:58.148
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN JOKE
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

12:58.148 --> 13:00.150
WE HEARD
YOU AND DADDY TALKING

13:00.150 --> 13:02.883
ABOUT HOW RICK WANTED
TO TAKE YOU AWAY.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.385
PORTER WAS SO MAD.
HE WANTED TO BLOW RICK UP.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.018
PRESTON TOLD HIM
HE COULD USE DYNAMITE.

13:08.018 --> 13:10.020
I TOLD THEM
THAT WAS STUPID.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.122
NO ONE HAS DYNAMITE
IN THEIR HOUSE.

13:12.122 --> 13:16.026
BUT EVERYONE HAS MATCHES.

13:16.026 --> 13:18.328
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

13:18.328 --> 13:20.871
SOMEONE
COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

13:20.871 --> 13:22.302
BUT THEY WEREN'T.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.074
BUT IT DOESN'TMATTER!

13:24.074 --> 13:28.839
INTENTIONALLY SETTING A FIRE
IS A VERY SERIOUS CRIME.

13:28.839 --> 13:31.081
DON'T YOUGETTHAT?

13:31.081 --> 13:32.412
I DO.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.445
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S GOOD
YOU'RE PUNISHING THE TWINS.

13:35.445 --> 13:37.417
THEY'RE REALLY BAD KIDS,

13:37.417 --> 13:40.350
AND THEY NEED TO LEARN.

13:54.004 --> 13:57.007
(indistinct conversations)

13:58.608 --> 14:00.941
I TOLD YOU
WE'D BE OVERDRESSED.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.943
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.945
IT SHOWS OUR RESPECT
FOR LAMAZE,

14:04.945 --> 14:07.617
AND, YOU KNOW,
THE WHOLE BIRTHING PROCESS.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.621
ORIT'S THAT
YOUR EX-HUSBAND'S HERE.

14:11.621 --> 14:14.124
KARL? IS HE HERE?
OH, WHAT A FREAKISH--

14:14.124 --> 14:16.626
DON'T EVEN BOTHER.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME?

14:16.626 --> 14:19.429
'CAUSE I KNEW YOU'D MAKE US
SWITCH TO ANOTHER CLASS.

14:19.429 --> 14:21.431
LAST TIME I WAS HERE,

14:21.431 --> 14:23.934
KARL KEPT THROWING
HIS PERFECT LIFE IN MY FACE,

14:23.934 --> 14:25.936
AND I JUST WANTED
TO COME BACK HERE

14:25.936 --> 14:28.999
AND SHOW HIM THAT WE WERE
DOING WELL, TOO.
 HENCE THE SPORT COAT.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.300
"HENCE." THAT'S CLASSY.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.572
SAY A LOT OF "HENCE"
WHEN WE SEE HIM.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.445
SUSAN, I'M NOT GONNA LIE
ABOUT WHO I AM.

14:35.445 --> 14:38.108
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO LIE.
I'M JUST SAYING SPIN.

14:38.108 --> 14:40.110
WHY WON'T YOU SPIN?
 I DON'T KNOW.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.453
HEY, PLUMBER!
SOMEBODY CLOG A TOILET?

14:45.055 --> 14:46.987
I'M IN.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.288
HEY, GUYS.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.960
MIKE, YOU REMEMBER KARL?

14:49.960 --> 14:53.323
AND THIS IS KARL'S WIFE
MARISA.
 HELLO.

14:53.323 --> 14:55.095
SO HOW'S THINGS GOING?

14:55.095 --> 14:57.397
YOU STILL SPENDING
MOST OF YOUR TIME

14:57.397 --> 14:59.399
WITH YOUR HEAD
UNDER A SINK?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.401
ACTUALLY, I HIRED
A COUPLE OF GUYS,

15:01.401 --> 15:03.403
AND THEY DO ALL THE WORK.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.106
I JUST SIT BACK
AND CASH THE CHECKS,

15:06.106 --> 15:07.577
HENCE THE SPORT COAT.

15:07.577 --> 15:10.380
YEAH, YOU GUYS LOOK FANTASTIC.
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A SLOB.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.382
KIND OF OVERDRESSED,
AREN'T YOU?

15:12.382 --> 15:15.515
WELL, AFTER THIS,
WE HAVE A BIG PARTY TO GO TO.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.048
YEAH, OUR SOCIAL LIFE
IS JUST CRAZY THESE DAYS.

15:18.048 --> 15:21.091
SEEMS LIKE EVERY NIGHT
WE HAVE SOME FANCY PARTY.
 JUST BANANAS. (chuckles)

15:21.091 --> 15:23.123
WHY DON'T YOU EVER
TAKEMEOUT?

15:23.123 --> 15:25.225
HEY, AT LEAST
I DIDN'T DITCH YOU

15:25.225 --> 15:28.158
ON THE FIRST DAY
OF LAMAZE CLASS.

15:28.158 --> 15:31.361
I DIDN'T DITCH SUSAN.
I WAS GETTING MY 30-DAY CHIP.

15:31.361 --> 15:34.304
WHAT, YOU'RE LIKE AN ALKIE?

15:34.304 --> 15:36.706
DRUGS, ACTUALLY.
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

15:36.706 --> 15:38.708
BUT I WENT THROUGH REHAB,

15:38.708 --> 15:41.371
AND I'M CLEAN NOW.

15:41.371 --> 15:43.543
WOW. CONGRATULATIONS.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.946
(woman) OKAY, PEOPLE, TIME TO
GET STARTED. TAKE YOUR SEATS.

15:49.119 --> 15:51.621
(lowered voice)
SO YOUR HUBBY'S BEEN IN REHAB?

15:51.621 --> 15:53.423
THAT'S JUST BANANAS.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.129
WOW.

15:59.129 --> 16:00.460
I KNOW.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.463
TURNS OUT THE WHOLE THING
WAS KAYLA'S IDEA.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.465
WELL, I GUESS
PORTER AND PRESTON HAVE

16:05.465 --> 16:07.467
A NEW DISHWASHING BUDDY,
HUH?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.199
MM, NO.

16:09.199 --> 16:11.501
I THINK IT GOES
A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THAT.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.203
I THINK WE HAVE

16:13.203 --> 16:16.176
A SERIOUSLY TROUBLED
YOUNG GIRL.

16:16.176 --> 16:20.480
SHE NEEDS...
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.012
LIKE THERAPY?

16:22.012 --> 16:24.084
YOU BROUGHT IT UP BEFORE,
AND IN THIS CASE,

16:24.084 --> 16:26.486
I REALLY DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A CHOICE.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.488
INTERESTING.
SO THE BOYS, WHO ACTUALLY

16:28.488 --> 16:31.061
PHYSICALLY SET THE FIRE--
THEYDON'TNEED THERAPY,

16:31.061 --> 16:33.363
BUT KAYLA, WHO ONLY
TALKED ABOUT IT--SHE DOES?

16:33.363 --> 16:35.765
YOU DIDN'T SEE HER.
SHE JUST SAT THERE,

16:35.765 --> 16:38.768
PLAYING WITH HER DOLL
WITH THIS KIND OF EERIE CALM.

16:38.768 --> 16:42.572
OH, SHE WAS CALM. YEAH,
BETTER NIP THAT IN THE BUD.

16:42.572 --> 16:45.105
NO, YOU'RE MISSING MY POINT.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.107
NO, I GET YOUR POINT.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.109
THERE ARE DIFFERENT RULES
FOR MY KID

16:49.109 --> 16:51.111
THAN THERE ARE FOR YOURS.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.243
WELL... YEAH.

16:53.243 --> 16:56.116
THINK OF WHAT THAT POOR GIRL
HAS BEEN THROUGH.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.419
AND ON TOP OF THAT...
(sighs)

16:59.419 --> 17:02.152
HER MOM
WAS KIND OF A PSYCHO.

17:02.152 --> 17:06.656
OKAY, YOU ARE SAYING
THAT KAYLA IS A PSYCHO NOW.

17:06.656 --> 17:11.631
I AM JUST SAYING,
APPLE... TREE.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.633
MAYBE NOT SO FAR.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.606
AND I'M JUST SAYING,
MY DAUGHTER IS FINE.

17:16.606 --> 17:18.407
NO THERAPY.

17:21.511 --> 17:25.575
(car approaching)

17:28.117 --> 17:30.320
(dog barking in distance)

17:30.320 --> 17:32.722
(grunts)
 (car door opens and shuts)

17:32.722 --> 17:35.054
ORSON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:35.054 --> 17:38.158
BREE, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I HAVE BEEN DOING SOME THINKING.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.460
YES, I CAN SMELL THE THINKING
ON YOUR BREATH.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.062
ARE YOU INSANE,
DRIVING IN THIS CONDITION?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.365
NO, I DIDN'T. I ARRIVED SOBER,
AND I DRANK WHILE I WAITED.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.297
I AM A LAW-ABIDING MAN.

17:47.297 --> 17:50.200
EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL
HIT-AND-RUN.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.143
AH, THE INCIDENT. THAT'S WHAT
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT.

17:53.143 --> 17:55.805
I AM PREPARED
TO MEET YOUR CONDITION

17:55.805 --> 17:57.807
AND GO TO THE POLICE.

17:57.807 --> 18:00.210
(whispers) YOU ARE?

18:00.210 --> 18:02.712
YES,
I HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

18:02.712 --> 18:05.215
THE KEY IS THE SLEEPWALKING.
SUSAN SAW IT.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.657
WE'LL FIND A PSYCHIATRIST
TO TESTIFY

18:07.657 --> 18:11.191
THAT I WAS SLEEPWALKING
WHEN I DROVE THE CAR.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.393
IT'S BRILLIANT!
 NO, IT'S A PATHETIC FANTASY

18:13.393 --> 18:16.166
FUELED BY COWARDICE
AND AMARETTO SOURS.

18:16.166 --> 18:19.129
YOU COMMITTED A CRIME, ORSON.
FACE IT.

18:19.129 --> 18:22.402
(whining) BREE, I JUST WANT
TO COME HOME. PLEASE!

18:24.103 --> 18:27.337
HEY! I'M GLAD YOU TWO
ARE PATCHING THINGS UP,

18:27.337 --> 18:29.809
BUT TAKE
THE MAKEUP SEX INSIDE.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.811
EDIE, WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR

18:31.811 --> 18:33.813
AND TAKE ORSON BACK
TO HIS APARTMENT?

18:33.813 --> 18:37.647
I HAVE TO LET
MY SITTER GO HOME.
 UH, ALL RIGHT. HOP IN.

18:37.647 --> 18:40.820
OH, NO, PLEASE.
DON'T MAKE ME GO BACK THERE.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.654
THE OTHER DIVORCED MEN ARE
TRYING TO START A BOOK CLUB.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.356
OH, FOR GOD SAKES.

18:46.356 --> 18:48.628
YOU CAN SLEEP IT OFF
ON MY COUCH TONIGHT.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.631
(gasps)
 NOW HITCH UP YOUR SKIRT
AND GET IN.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.364
YEAH. YEAH.

18:56.366 --> 18:58.668
THERE HAVE BEEN MEN
COMING OUT OF HER ROOM

18:58.668 --> 19:00.670
AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT,

19:00.670 --> 19:02.672
AND I SAW HER
COUNTING A WAD OF CASH.

19:02.672 --> 19:04.374
SO LONG STORY SHORT,

19:04.374 --> 19:07.377
I NEED YOUR HELP TO GET
THAT HOOKER OUT OF MY HOUSE.

19:07.377 --> 19:09.379
WHAT DO YOU WANTUSTO DO?

19:09.379 --> 19:11.381
WELL,
I'VE GOT NO SOLID EVIDENCE,

19:11.381 --> 19:13.152
AND SHE'S GOT A LEASE.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.155
SO, BOB, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
"SOLICIT" HER SERVICES.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.157
THAT WAY I'LL HAVE PROOF.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.261
YOU DO KNOW I'M GAY, RIGHT?

19:21.261 --> 19:23.563
EXACTLY. YOU PEOPLE
ARE THEATRICAL, AND I NEED

19:23.563 --> 19:26.696
SOMEONE I CAN COUNT ON
TO GIVE A DECENT PERFORMANCE.

19:26.696 --> 19:29.369
I DON'T KNOW.
 I'LL DO IT.

19:31.601 --> 19:33.303
WHAT?

19:33.303 --> 19:34.604
WELL, NO OFFENSE.

19:34.604 --> 19:37.707
I JUST THINK BOB HAS
A BETTER SHOT AT PULLING IT OFF.

19:37.707 --> 19:39.579
HE'S A LITTLE MORE...

19:39.579 --> 19:42.252
BUTCH. I KNOW.

19:42.252 --> 19:43.613
YOU HEAR THAT, HONEY?

19:43.613 --> 19:46.616
PLEASE, THE ONLY WAY YOU'D BE
CONVINCING AS A STRAIGHT GUY

19:46.616 --> 19:49.359
IS IF YOU DIED AND CAME BACK
AS A STRAIGHT GUY.

19:49.359 --> 19:53.263
I'M SORRY. WHO WENT TO
THEIR SENIOR PROMWITHA GIRL?

19:53.263 --> 19:55.395
YEAH,
SUZY SELLERS, GAY MAKER.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.727
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUTCH,
YOU SHOULD KNOW

19:57.727 --> 20:00.400
THAT I PLAYED TONY
IN "WEST SIDE STORY"

20:00.400 --> 20:01.901
TO RAVE REVIEWS.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.903
HE ALSO MADE OUT
WITH OFFICER KRUPKE

20:03.903 --> 20:05.975
DURING INTERMISSION.

20:05.975 --> 20:09.809
WELL, I REALLY
DON'T CARE WHO DOES IT.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.911
JUST GET IT DONE.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.345
AND... DON'T WEAR THAT.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.619
(sighs)

20:19.619 --> 20:21.951
UGH. NEVER WATCH
A C-SECTION FILM

20:21.951 --> 20:24.854
IF YOU HAD
A CALZONE FOR LUNCH.

20:27.657 --> 20:29.459
EVERYTHING OKAY?

20:30.730 --> 20:33.433
DID YOU HAVE TO TELL KARL
ABOUT REHAB?

20:33.433 --> 20:36.436
YOU SAID
I DIDN'T HAVE TO LIE.
 YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

20:36.436 --> 20:39.469
YOU HAVE TO GO BLURTING ALL
OUR DEEPEST, DARKEST SECRETS.
 (alarm chirps)

20:39.469 --> 20:41.471
IT'S NOT DARK.
IT'S PART OF WHO I AM.

20:41.471 --> 20:44.474
PLUS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
THEY TEACH YOU IN THE PROGRAM IS

20:44.474 --> 20:47.317
IT'S NOT HEALTHY TO KEEP
SECRETS. HENCE, THE HONESTY.

20:47.317 --> 20:49.879
OH, ENOUGH WITH THE "HENCE."
(sighs)

20:49.879 --> 20:52.382
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT SOME THINGS ARE PRIVATE,

20:52.382 --> 20:54.454
AND I THINK
THAT YOU CAN BE HONEST

20:54.454 --> 20:55.955
WITHOUT BEING INAPPROPRIATE.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.588
WHEN I SAID IT,
HIS WIFE CONGRATULATED ME.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.290
DID YOU NOTICE THAT?

21:00.290 --> 21:02.332
AND KARL MADE
HIS HAPPY MONKEY FACE.

21:02.332 --> 21:03.633
DID YOU NOTICE THAT?

21:03.633 --> 21:05.335
YOU KNOW WHAT, SUSAN?

21:05.335 --> 21:07.467
THIS REMINDS ME
OF THE BATTLE I HAVE TO FIGHT

21:07.467 --> 21:09.969
EVERY DAY
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.542
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT
TO ME.

21:12.542 --> 21:16.506
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS
WHAT YOUR EX-HUSBAND THINKS.

21:25.855 --> 21:27.857
THIS ISN'T
DR. KAGEN'S OFFICE.

21:27.857 --> 21:30.360
WELL, ACTUALLY, THIS IS
A DIFFERENT KIND OF DOCTOR.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.493
YOU KNOW,
THE KIND YOU CAN TALK TO?

21:33.493 --> 21:36.496
YOU BROUGHT ME TO A SHRINK?
 WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE

21:36.496 --> 21:39.499
TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE WHERE
YOU COULD SHARE YOUR FEELINGS.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.300
YOU KNOW?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.833
WITH YOUR MOM'S DEATH
AND MOVING IN WITH US,

21:43.833 --> 21:45.835
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

21:45.835 --> 21:48.538
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
I'M FINE.

21:48.538 --> 21:49.839
WELL, GOOD,

21:49.839 --> 21:53.883
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU GO THROUGH HARD THINGS,

21:53.883 --> 21:55.915
IT CHANGES
THE WAY YOU THINK.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.818
MAYBE WE HAVE TROUBLE
TELLING THE DIFFERENCE

21:58.818 --> 22:02.392
BETWEEN WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WHAT'S WRONG.

22:02.392 --> 22:05.024
I DON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE
WITH THAT.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.326
ACTUALLY, YOU DO.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.329
SO LET'S JUST WAIT
AND TALK TO THE DOCTOR, OKAY?

22:11.501 --> 22:13.363
(sighs)

22:16.906 --> 22:19.809
YOU KNOW WHAT, LYNETTE?
 HMM?

22:19.809 --> 22:21.811
MAYBE ISHOULD
 TALK TO THE DOCTOR

22:21.811 --> 22:23.513
ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG.

22:23.513 --> 22:25.415
GOOD.

22:25.415 --> 22:28.017
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD
TALK TO THE POLICE.

22:28.017 --> 22:32.121
WHAT? NO. SWEETIE,
WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

22:32.121 --> 22:34.454
REALLY? 'CAUSE WHAT
THE TWINS DID IS A CRIME.

22:34.454 --> 22:37.857
I MEAN, LIKE YOU SAID,
SOMEONE COULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

22:37.857 --> 22:41.431
SO IF WE DON'T GO TO THE POLICE,
WOULDN'TTHATBE WRONG?

22:41.431 --> 22:43.933
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:43.933 --> 22:45.595
NO, I DO.

22:45.595 --> 22:49.769
IFIHAVE TO TALK TO THE SHRINK,
 IHAVE TO TALK TO THE COPS.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.701
(door opens)

22:51.701 --> 22:56.075
HI. YOU MUST BE KAYLA.
I'M ALL READY FOR YOU.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.608
ACTUALLY,
I THINK WE'RE OKAY.

22:58.608 --> 23:01.681
WE... RESOLVED OUR PROBLEMS

23:01.681 --> 23:03.683
JUST SITTING
IN YOUR WAITING ROOM.

23:03.683 --> 23:06.416
(laughs) BOY, YOU'RE GOOD.

23:06.416 --> 23:09.659
AHEM. 'KAY.
SO WE'RE GONNA GO.

23:16.466 --> 23:19.028
TARGET IN PLACE. WE'RE A GO.

23:19.028 --> 23:20.600
(Bob) He's coming out.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.478
WHAT IS HE WEARING?

23:28.478 --> 23:32.181
HE LOOKS LIKE
THE LOST MEMBER OF WHAM!

23:32.181 --> 23:34.684
HE THINKS THE OUTFIT
MAKES HIM LOOK STRAIGHT.

23:34.684 --> 23:37.887
JUST BE THANKFUL I GOT
THE TOOTHPICK OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

23:37.887 --> 23:40.850
(speaking indistinctly)

23:40.850 --> 23:43.553
MUSTHE PUT HIS HAND
ON HIS HIP LIKE THAT?

23:43.553 --> 23:45.555
BUTCH UP, FOR GOD SAKES!

23:45.555 --> 23:47.657
WHAT?!
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

23:47.657 --> 23:48.998
UH-OH.

23:48.998 --> 23:50.860
WHAT?!
 OHH!

23:50.860 --> 23:54.103
OH, CRAP! ABORT! ABORT!

23:54.103 --> 23:57.567
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
 YOU ARE A PIG,
AND I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS.

23:57.567 --> 23:59.669
OHH!
 ELLIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:59.669 --> 24:01.671
YOUR CREEPY NEIGHBOR--
HE CAME OVER HERE

24:01.671 --> 24:05.745
AND OFFERED ME MONEY
TO SLEEP WITH HIM.
 (strained voice)
GABY, TELL HER.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.917
TELL ME WHAT?

24:07.917 --> 24:10.520
UH, HE DID
THE SAME THING TO ME.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.181
PERV!
 OHH!

24:12.181 --> 24:16.486
HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
GABY, TELL HER, OR I WILL.

24:16.486 --> 24:18.027
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:18.027 --> 24:21.691
HERE'S THE THING. (sighs)

24:21.691 --> 24:23.733
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A HOOKER.

24:23.733 --> 24:28.698
SO I HAD LEE PROPOSITION YOU
SO I COULD CATCH YOU IN THE ACT.

24:28.698 --> 24:31.000
BUT GUESS WHAT?
YOU PASSED THE TEST. YAY!

24:31.000 --> 24:33.973
(chuckles nervously)
EVERYBODY INSIDE FOR MARGARITAS.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.150
ELLIE, WAIT.
I MADE A MISTAKE.

24:41.150 --> 24:44.013
CAN WE PLEASE TALK
ABOUT THIS?

24:44.013 --> 24:47.557
DUDE, YOU JUST TOLD
YOUR NEIGHBORS THAT I'M A WHORE.

24:47.557 --> 24:49.559
LOOK AT IT
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.

24:49.559 --> 24:52.562
YOU'RE AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.
GUYS ARE COMING AND GOING.

24:52.562 --> 24:55.525
I SAW YOU TAKE MONEY
FROM ONE OF 'EM.

24:55.525 --> 24:57.927
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK?

24:57.927 --> 25:02.832
ALL RIGHT.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW.

25:04.534 --> 25:06.676
I DO TATTOOS.

25:06.676 --> 25:08.237
YOU DO WHAT?

25:08.237 --> 25:09.609
SEE,
I'VE BEEN WORKING DOWNTOWN,

25:09.609 --> 25:14.784
AND I HAVE THIS JERK OF A BOSS
WHO TAKES 70% OF MY MONEY.

25:14.784 --> 25:17.587
SO I'M TRYING TO
EARN ENOUGH CASH

25:17.587 --> 25:19.589
TO FINALLY OPEN MY OWN SHOP.

25:19.589 --> 25:23.152
YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING
A TATTOO PARLOR OUT OF MY HOUSE?

25:23.152 --> 25:26.656
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY I LIED.

25:26.656 --> 25:28.658
I'LL BE GONE
IN THE MORNING.

25:28.658 --> 25:30.830
OKAY, ELLIE, WAIT.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.732
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.
 ARE YOU SURE?

25:32.732 --> 25:35.805
BECAUSE I HAVE TO KEEP DOING
MY WORK TO PAY FOR SCHOOL.

25:35.805 --> 25:39.639
WELL, I SUPPOSE I COULD LOOK
THE OTHER WAY FOR A FEW MONTHS.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.942
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO
FOR THINKING YOU'RE A WHORE.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.675
(chuckles) FORGIVE ME?

25:45.675 --> 25:47.246
OF COURSE.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.668
(doorbell rings)

26:10.840 --> 26:12.602
OH, HI.

26:12.602 --> 26:15.605
HI, EDIE. THANKS AGAIN
FOR HELPING ME OUT LAST NIGHT.

26:15.605 --> 26:16.746
OH, NO PROBLEM.

26:16.746 --> 26:18.748
ORSON'S CAR IS STILL PARKED
AT MY HOUSE.

26:18.748 --> 26:21.651
UM, DID HE MENTION WHEN HE'D BE
COMING BACK TO PICK IT UP?

26:21.651 --> 26:25.915
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM
YOURSELF? HE'S IN THE SHOWER.

26:25.915 --> 26:27.917
HE SPENT THE NIGHT HERE?

26:27.917 --> 26:30.690
APPARENTLY, HE'S NOT A BIG FAN
OF FAIRVIEW TOWERS,

26:30.690 --> 26:33.893
AND HE WAS SO DRUNK AND WHINY,
I JUST LET HIM RIDE MY COUCH.

26:33.893 --> 26:37.827
WELL, UM, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IN THE FUTURE,

26:37.827 --> 26:41.971
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

26:41.971 --> 26:43.602
BREE...

26:43.602 --> 26:45.604
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

26:45.604 --> 26:47.176
OH, I-I-I THINK YOU KNOW.

26:47.176 --> 26:49.178
TELL ME ANYWAY,

26:49.178 --> 26:52.111
JUST IN CASE YOU'RENOT
 SAYING I'M A BIG SLUT.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.113
OH, COME ON, EDIE.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.185
YOU KNOW,
CARLOS, MIKE, KARL--

26:56.185 --> 26:59.188
YOU DO HAVE A WAY AT PICKING
AT OTHER WOMEN'S LEFTOVERS.

26:59.188 --> 27:01.891
FIRST OF ALL,
I AMNOTATTRACTED TO ORSON.

27:01.891 --> 27:04.794
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE LIKE
HAVING SEX WITH PBS.

27:04.794 --> 27:07.697
AND SECOND, JUST BECAUSE
I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE,

27:07.697 --> 27:11.030
I'M GONNA LET HIM STAY
AS LONG AS HE WANTS.
 EDIE!

27:11.030 --> 27:14.163
DAYS, WEEKS--MIGHT EVEN LET HIM
HANG MY CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

27:14.163 --> 27:16.866
COME ON, EDIE.
THINK OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

27:26.315 --> 27:28.317
HOW'D YOU EXPECT ME TO REACT,
LYNETTE?

27:28.317 --> 27:31.020
YOU TOOK HER TO THERAPY
BEHIND MY BACK.
 (refrigerator door opens)

27:31.020 --> 27:33.322
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT
UNLESS I THOUGHT

27:33.322 --> 27:36.255
WE HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM,
WHICH WE DO.
 WHY, BECAUSE SHE THREATENED YOU?

27:36.255 --> 27:38.758
OF COURSE SHE DID.
YOU AMBUSHED HER.
 TOM, IT IS ONE THING

27:38.758 --> 27:41.390
NOT TO WANT TO ADMIT
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOUR KID.

27:41.390 --> 27:44.093
IT'S ANOTHER TO JUST
BURY YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND.

27:44.093 --> 27:46.395
WHO'S BURYING THEIR HEAD
IN THE SAND?
 YOU ARE. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES
THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT--

27:46.395 --> 27:50.039
NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU'RE DISTORTING REALITY.
 I'M NOT!
WHAT WOULD BE MY AGENDA?

27:50.039 --> 27:52.942
(Tom) YOU CAN'T PULL THE CRAP
LIKE THIS.

28:03.252 --> 28:05.684
WHOA!

28:05.684 --> 28:07.316
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:07.316 --> 28:09.719
I JUMPED OFF THE ROOF.
IT WAS AWESOME.

28:09.719 --> 28:11.160
NO WAY.

28:11.160 --> 28:14.894
YEAH. IT WAS JUST LIKE
A PARACHUTE. YOU WANNA TRY IT?

28:14.894 --> 28:17.326
BUT MAYBE IT WON'T WORK.

28:17.326 --> 28:19.328
ITWILL.I JUSTDIDIT.

28:19.328 --> 28:22.431
IF YOU WANT,
I CAN SHOW YOU.

28:22.431 --> 28:25.304
OH, WAIT.
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.006
YOU CAN'T.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.409
NEVER MIND.

28:35.444 --> 28:38.387
(front door opens and shuts)

28:38.387 --> 28:41.090
...YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND. NO.
 YOU'RE BURYING
YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND.

28:41.090 --> 28:44.393
IT IS DIFFERENT. NO, BECAUSE
YOU'RE DISTORTING REALITY.
 THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES
THAT YOU COULD LOOK AND SEE

28:44.393 --> 28:47.026
WHAT'S GOING ON. I AM NOT!
 BUT YOU CAN'T PULL CRAP
LIKE THIS, LYNETTE.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.328
EITHER YOU TREAT KAYLA
LIKE SHE'S YOUR OWN KID--
 COME ON. I DO.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.400
(loud thump in distance)
 (Preston) AAH!

28:51.400 --> 28:53.402
(Porter) MOM!
 (sighs)

28:53.402 --> 28:54.904
OW! OW, OW, OW, OW!

28:54.904 --> 28:57.406
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:57.406 --> 28:59.168
(Porter) IS HE OKAY?

28:59.168 --> 29:02.411
PORTER,
GET DOWN OFF THAT ROOF!
 GET UP. UP.

29:02.411 --> 29:04.443
OW! IT HURTS.
 OH, WE GOTTA TAKE HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

29:04.443 --> 29:07.446
OKAY, YOU STAY HERE.
YOU TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS.
 OKAY.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.079
I WILL TAKE HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.
 ALL RIGHT.

29:10.079 --> 29:12.782
NO, YOU--YOU BOTH GO.
I GOT THE KIDS. GO, GO, GO, GO.
 THANKS, KAREN.
COME HERE, BUDDY.

29:12.782 --> 29:15.484
THERE. IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE.

29:15.484 --> 29:16.986
(car door shuts)

29:16.986 --> 29:18.487
(Lynette) THERE.

29:21.831 --> 29:23.262
(engine starts)

29:31.340 --> 29:33.042
(sighs)

29:34.773 --> 29:36.345
HEY, SUSIE.

29:36.345 --> 29:38.177
WHERE'S THE PLUMBER?

29:38.177 --> 29:41.450
FISHING A WEDDING RING OUT OF
SOME HOUSEWIFE'S GREASE TRAP?

29:41.450 --> 29:43.782
HE'S NOT FEELING WELL.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.115
I SEE MARISA ISN'T HERE
EITHER.

29:46.115 --> 29:48.818
YEAH, SHE GOT STUCK
AT HER BOOK SIGNING.

29:48.818 --> 29:50.820
SHE WRITES BOOKS, LIKE YOU,

29:50.820 --> 29:54.223
ONLY HERS ARE FOR GROWN-UPS
AND THEY SELL.

29:54.223 --> 29:57.196
OKAY, KARL, YOU WIN.
YOU HAPPY?

29:57.196 --> 30:00.529
(laughs) WHOA.
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

30:00.529 --> 30:03.432
JUST DROP THE ACT.
YOU ARE SO LOVING THIS.

30:03.432 --> 30:05.134
YOU ENDED UP

30:05.134 --> 30:07.476
WITH THE MISS AMERICA
WITH A LAW DEGREE,

30:07.476 --> 30:10.109
AND I ENDED UP
WITH THE PILLHEAD PLUMBER.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.310
BRAVO.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.343
OH! DAMN IT!
WHY WON'T THIS UNROLL?

30:14.343 --> 30:19.088
YOU KNOW,
MARISA'S NOT PERFECT.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.520
WE HAVE OUR PROBLEMS
LIKE ANYONE ELSE.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.522
OH, REALLY?

30:23.522 --> 30:26.395
YOU GUYS LIVE
ONE DAY AT A TIME?

30:26.395 --> 30:28.397
IS YOUR FIRST THOUGHT
WHEN SHE'S LATE

30:28.397 --> 30:32.101
THAT MAYBE SHE'S OUT USING AGAIN
OR MAYBE SHE'S DEAD?

30:34.433 --> 30:37.506
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING
IS SO FRAGILE RIGHT NOW,

30:37.506 --> 30:40.509
WHICH IS NOT THE WAY
YOU WANT IT TO BE

30:40.509 --> 30:43.012
WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE
A BABY.

30:47.176 --> 30:49.448
UGH.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.151
SO YOU'RE WORRIED
YOU MIGHT BE HAVING A KID

30:52.151 --> 30:54.483
WITH AN UNRELIABLE GUY.

30:54.483 --> 30:57.026
I GET IT.
YOU DID THAT ONCE BEFORE.

30:57.026 --> 30:59.628
UH, YEAH.
THAT GUY WAS THE WORST.

30:59.628 --> 31:01.931
(laughs) WASN'T I, THOUGH?

31:01.931 --> 31:04.293
I CHEATED, DRANK TOO MUCH.

31:04.293 --> 31:07.196
I MADE THAT PLAY
FOR YOUR COUSIN.

31:07.196 --> 31:09.498
OH, RIGHT,
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

31:09.498 --> 31:11.600
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.303
ANYWAY,
I LIED ABOUT EVERY BIT OF IT.

31:14.303 --> 31:16.605
AT LEAST MIKE'S TRYING
TO BE HONEST.

31:16.605 --> 31:18.347
I KNOW.

31:18.347 --> 31:21.150
I JUST WISH I COULD
FAST-FORWARD THROUGH MY LIFE

31:21.150 --> 31:23.452
AND SEE THAT EVERYTHING
ENDS UP OKAY.

31:23.452 --> 31:26.455
HEY, DON'T TELL
THE PLUMBER THIS,

31:26.455 --> 31:28.457
BUT, UH...
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

31:28.457 --> 31:31.160
I THINK
HE'S GONNA BE THERE FOR YOU

31:31.160 --> 31:33.192
IN A WAY THAT I NEVER WAS.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.294
THANK YOU.

31:37.296 --> 31:40.169
WHICH COUSIN?

31:40.169 --> 31:42.901
OH, LOOK,
A MODEL OF THE UTERUS.

31:46.075 --> 31:48.607
HE'S A BIG, GRAY CAT, SO IF YOU
COULD JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT?

31:48.607 --> 31:52.041
OF COURSE.
 ACTUALLY, KAREN,
WHEN I'M DONE HERE,

31:52.041 --> 31:55.044
I COULD GO TRY TO FIND TOBY
FOR YOU.
 THANKS, BREE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

31:55.044 --> 31:57.686
OH, IF YOU DO FIND HIM,
DON'T LOOK HIM IN THE EYE.

31:57.686 --> 32:00.049
IT ANGRIES HIM UP.

32:00.049 --> 32:03.592
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU
TO HELP HER,

32:03.592 --> 32:06.595
AND IT'LL TAKE YOUR MIND OFF
OF EVERYTHING WITH ORSON, TOO.

32:06.595 --> 32:09.628
I HOPE SO.
TRUTH IS, I MISS HIM.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.331
AND I'LL PROBABLY LET HIM
COME HOME EVENTUALLY.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.563
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
HE UNDERSTANDS

32:14.563 --> 32:16.665
THE GRAVITY OF WHAT HE DID.

32:16.665 --> 32:19.638
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID,
BUT BE CAREFUL.

32:19.638 --> 32:22.171
SOME MEN SAY
THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE,

32:22.171 --> 32:23.642
AND THEY CAN'T.

32:23.642 --> 32:27.616
OH, HELLO, DYLAN.
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

32:27.616 --> 32:30.980
SHE HAS A DATE
WITH A BOY I HAVEN'T MET YET.

32:30.980 --> 32:33.482
IT'S JUST A MOVIE.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

32:33.482 --> 32:35.985
BE THAT AS IT MAY,
IT'S THE, WHAT,

32:35.985 --> 32:39.688
THIRD TIME YOU'VE GONE OUT?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.

32:39.688 --> 32:42.691
MOM, I TOLD YOU. I'M NOT READY
FOR YOU TO MEET HIM.

32:42.691 --> 32:46.135
WHEN I AM, YOU'LL KNOW.
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. HODGE.
 GOOD NIGHT.

32:46.135 --> 32:49.668
(door opens and shuts)
 OKAY, BACK TO BUSINESS.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.740
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
PARKER HOUSE ROLLS?

32:51.740 --> 32:54.473
I MEAN, PERSONALLY,
I THINK THEY'RE PLAYED OUT.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.746
ACTUALLY, BREE, CAN WE
PICK THIS UP AGAIN TOMORROW?

32:57.746 --> 33:01.580
WELL, OF COURSE.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.713
OH, YES. I JUST NEED TO GO
SPY ON MY DAUGHTER.

33:04.713 --> 33:06.655
AH, THE KEY IS
TO KEEP ONE CAR

33:06.655 --> 33:10.519
BETWEEN YOURS AND HERS
AT ALL TIMES. HAVE FUN.

33:13.662 --> 33:16.625
OH, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET THE CHECK.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.627
I HAVE TO BE BACK
BY 10:00.

33:18.627 --> 33:21.530
WE STILL HAVE TIME
FOR COFFEE?

33:21.530 --> 33:24.573
I DON'T WANNA PUSH IT.
MOM WAS ALL OVER ME TONIGHT.

33:24.573 --> 33:27.436
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

33:27.436 --> 33:29.608
WHATEVER. IT'S FINE.

33:29.608 --> 33:34.743
NO. IT'S NOT. I CAN SEE HOW HARD
THIS WHOLE THING IS ON YOU.

33:34.743 --> 33:38.717
IT MAKES ME WISH
WE COULD JUST...

33:38.717 --> 33:40.589
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

33:40.589 --> 33:43.092
I DON'T KNOW.

33:43.092 --> 33:45.154
WELL...

33:45.154 --> 33:48.257
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

33:48.257 --> 33:51.260
WE GOT A GOOD THING GOING HERE.
I DON'T WANNA RUIN IT.

33:53.332 --> 33:58.707
BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.
IF IT WAS ONLY UP TO ME...

33:58.707 --> 34:00.669
I'D COME CLEAN.

34:00.669 --> 34:02.541
YOU WOULD?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.313
ABSOLUTELY.

34:04.313 --> 34:08.217
THAT WAY I COULD TELL YOUR MOM
HOW SORRY I AM.

34:08.217 --> 34:10.819
I-I WOULDN'T EXPECT HER
TO FORGIVE ME,

34:10.819 --> 34:12.821
BUT I COULD HOPE

34:12.821 --> 34:15.623
SHE COULD AT LEAST...

34:15.623 --> 34:19.088
SEE I'VE CHANGED.

34:21.590 --> 34:25.534
BUT WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO
IS OKAY BY ME.

34:33.502 --> 34:36.505
(crickets chirping)

34:55.824 --> 34:58.527
OKAY, THANK YOU.
 (beep)

34:58.527 --> 35:01.500
WELL, I'VE GOT A ROOM
AT A HOTEL IN MT. PLEASANT.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.502
I GUESS I'LL GET GOING.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.336
OH, IT'S LATE.
WHY NOT JUST GO TOMORROW?

35:07.336 --> 35:09.438
WELL,
I FEEL LIKE I'M IMPOSING.

35:09.438 --> 35:11.380
YOU ARE.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.382
BUT YOU MAKE
A DECENT MARTINI,

35:13.382 --> 35:15.384
SO WHAT THE HELL.

35:15.384 --> 35:17.316
SO...
 (giggles)

35:17.316 --> 35:19.318
YOU LIKE
THE HODGE FORMULA, HUH?

35:19.318 --> 35:21.320
YOU SEE, THE SECRET--

35:21.320 --> 35:23.852
(singsong voice)
I DON'T HEAR SHAKING.

35:26.425 --> 35:29.658
BY THE WAY, DID YOU SEE BREE
WHEN YOU WERE COMING HOME?

35:29.658 --> 35:31.560
OH.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.862
NO, I DIDN'T.

35:33.862 --> 35:36.335
I KEEP THINKING
SHE'S GONNA CALL ME.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.338
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO,

35:39.338 --> 35:41.340
BUT... WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED

35:41.340 --> 35:43.542
OVER AT KEN AND BARBIE'S
DREAM HOUSE?

35:43.542 --> 35:46.345
I MADE A MISTAKE,
AND BREE WON'T FORGIVE ME.

35:46.345 --> 35:49.618
YOU SEE,THAT'STHE PROBLEM
WITH THE BREES OF THIS WORLD.

35:49.618 --> 35:52.181
THEY'RE TOO DAMN PERFECT.

35:52.181 --> 35:54.553
I MEAN,
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND

35:54.553 --> 35:57.726
THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME--
WELL, THAT WE SCREW UP.

35:57.726 --> 36:00.389
YEAH, WELL,
THIS WAS NO ORDINARY MISTAKE.

36:00.389 --> 36:02.661
THIS WAS--THIS WAS
SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.593
WAS IT SOMETHING GAY?

36:04.593 --> 36:06.295
WHAT?

36:06.295 --> 36:08.667
OF COURSE IT WASN'T.
KEEP TALKING.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.369
TRUST ME.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.371
BREE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.503
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE SHE SHOULDN'T.

36:14.503 --> 36:18.377
MAYBE I'M NOT WORTHY
OF FORGIVENESS.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.509
WELL...

36:20.509 --> 36:23.512
ARE YOU SORRY
FOR WHAT YOU DID?

36:23.512 --> 36:29.388
YES. MORE THAN ANYONE
WILL EVER KNOW.

36:29.388 --> 36:32.621
WELL, THEN YOU'RE WORTHY.

36:32.621 --> 36:34.423
(clink)

36:36.525 --> 36:39.568
(voice breaks)
THANK YOU, EDIE.

36:39.568 --> 36:41.400
MM. DON'T START.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.702
I'M DRUNK.
I'M GONNA START CRYING, TOO.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.404
COMEON.

36:45.404 --> 36:48.637
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON,
EDIE BRITT.

36:48.637 --> 36:51.710
WELL, YOU'RE NOT SO BAD
YOURSELF.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.712
(chuckles)

37:01.550 --> 37:04.253
MM, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD...

37:04.253 --> 37:06.455
YOU'RE RIGHT. (chuckles)

37:06.455 --> 37:08.697
BAD IDEA.

37:08.697 --> 37:11.930
I BLAME THE HODGE FORMULA.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.633
YES.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.905
YOU'RE PROBABLY TIRED.

37:16.905 --> 37:20.709
LET ME GET YOUR ROOM
READY FOR YOU.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.746
(thud)

37:33.622 --> 37:34.983
(footsteps approach)

37:34.983 --> 37:36.785
MOM?

37:36.785 --> 37:39.658
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

37:39.658 --> 37:40.589
OF COURSE.

37:45.564 --> 37:50.038
(sighs) I GUESS
I JUST HAVE TO SAY IT.

37:50.038 --> 37:52.671
I'VE BEEN LYING TO YOU.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.703
THERE IS NO BOY.

37:54.703 --> 37:56.745
AND?

37:56.745 --> 37:59.548
AND...

37:59.548 --> 38:02.611
WELL, I'VE BEEN MEETING SOMEONE.
THAT PART IS TRUE.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.955
BUT IT'S DAD.

38:06.955 --> 38:08.957
I'VE BEEN MEETING DAD.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.692
REALLY?

38:13.692 --> 38:16.995
SO... YOU'RE NOT UPSET?

38:16.995 --> 38:21.530
YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
YOU WANTED TO MEET YOUR FATHER,

38:21.530 --> 38:24.603
SO I KNEW THIS DAY
WAS COMING,

38:24.603 --> 38:26.835
AND I PREPARED MYSELF.

38:26.835 --> 38:31.640
WELL,
CAN I GO GET HIM, THEN?

38:38.617 --> 38:41.049
COME IN! SHE SAYS IT'S OKAY.

38:49.758 --> 38:51.760
HEY, KATHY.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.734
BEEN A LONG TIME.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.637
DYLAN, WHY DON'T YOU
GO UP TO YOUR ROOM

38:58.637 --> 39:00.739
SO WE CAN CATCH UP?

39:03.712 --> 39:05.714
IT'S ALL RIGHT, REALLY.

39:05.714 --> 39:07.446
GO AHEAD, HONEY.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.054
YOU DID A GREAT JOB
WITH HER.

39:16.054 --> 39:19.658
SHE'S, UH,
SHE'S A WONDERFUL GIRL.

39:22.691 --> 39:24.663
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.665
HAVEN'T AGED A DAY.

39:33.001 --> 39:35.874
LOOK, I'M HERE
FOR DYLAN, OKAY?

39:35.874 --> 39:38.677
I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT
YOU TOLD HER,

39:38.677 --> 39:41.379
AND I'M SURE
SHE BELIEVED IT...

39:41.379 --> 39:44.012
BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU.

39:44.012 --> 39:45.714
BUT I DO.

39:45.714 --> 39:48.917
NO, YOU DON'T, KATHY,
NOT ANYMORE.

39:48.917 --> 39:51.019
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME--
12 YEARS.

39:51.019 --> 39:53.722
I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN.

39:53.722 --> 39:55.624
OKAY. GOOD,

39:55.624 --> 39:58.727
BECAUSE, UM...
I'VE CHANGED.

39:58.727 --> 40:00.729
I'M A DIFFERENT MAN NOW.

40:02.571 --> 40:06.805
WELL, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
THAT'S POSSIBLE, RIGHT?

40:06.805 --> 40:08.907
YOU'VE CHANGED, HUH?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.840
WELL, MAYBE YOU HAVE.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.913
I HAVE.
LIKE TO KNOW HOW?

40:14.913 --> 40:19.788
SURE...
IF YOU WANNA TELL ME.

40:19.788 --> 40:22.190
I'M NOT SCARED OF YOU
ANYMORE.

40:22.190 --> 40:25.494
GOOD.

40:25.494 --> 40:27.726
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.

40:29.858 --> 40:33.031
I'M NOT THE SAME WOMAN
YOU KNOCKED AROUND,

40:33.031 --> 40:36.204
THE WOMAN YOU PUNCHED...

40:36.204 --> 40:38.036
CHOKED...

40:38.036 --> 40:41.109
THE ONE WHOSE BLOOD
YOU LICKED OFF YOUR KNUCKLES.

40:41.109 --> 40:45.774
SHE'S GONE.

40:45.774 --> 40:50.078
SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO PROVE
YOU'RE A MAN...

40:50.078 --> 40:52.521
SOME OTHER WAY.

40:52.521 --> 40:55.854
YOU TRYING
TO MAKE ME MAD, KATHY?

41:00.689 --> 41:03.091
I DIDN'T KNOW I STILL COULD.

41:05.894 --> 41:08.937
CAN I?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.903
THIS IS A LOT TO DEAL WITH
AFTER SO LONG, I GUESS.

41:14.903 --> 41:17.906
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SPRUNG IT
ON YOU ALL AT ONCE.

41:17.906 --> 41:20.609
TELL DYLAN
I'LL CALL HER TOMORROW.

41:29.217 --> 41:32.260
AND YOU'RE AS BEAUTIFUL
AS YOU EVER WERE, KATH.

41:37.065 --> 41:39.768
GOOD NIGHT.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.804
(sighs)

41:52.841 --> 41:56.044
THE WORD "WELCOME"
ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT

41:56.044 --> 41:58.246
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK.

41:58.246 --> 41:59.848
AFTER ALL,

41:59.848 --> 42:05.824
TO LET SOMEONE INTO YOUR HOME
IS TO LET THEM INTO YOUR LIFE.

42:05.824 --> 42:09.798
AND WE NEVER KNOW
WHAT SORTS OF HORRIBLE SECRETS

42:09.798 --> 42:13.531
THEY CARRY WITH THEM.

42:13.531 --> 42:17.305
WE CAN'T FORESEE
THE PAINFUL EFFECT

42:17.305 --> 42:21.670
THEYMIGHTHAVE
ON OUR LOVED ONES.

42:23.311 --> 42:28.046
WE DON'T ANTICIPATE
THE GOSSIP THATCOULDRESULT

42:28.046 --> 42:31.149
FROM THEIR PRESENCE.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.921
YES...

42:32.921 --> 42:34.923
WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL

42:34.923 --> 42:38.927
WITH THOSE WE INVITE
INTO OUR LIVES...

42:38.927 --> 42:41.089
BECAUSE SOME...

42:41.089 --> 42:43.091
WILL REFUSE TO LEAVE.
