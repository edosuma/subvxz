All right, Chamberlain Heights.</i>

00:02.320 --> 00:03.550
<i>I hope you're ready
for tonight's game</i>

00:03.590 --> 00:05.990

Cuba Gooding Jr. High.</i>

<i>One win, and Duncan will be</i>

<i>in the playoffs
for the first time ever.</i>

<i>And after the game,
hang around for the jersey</i>

00:12.530 --> 00:14.630
<i>retirement for the all-time
leading scorer</i>

00:14.660 --> 00:16.900
<i>in Duncan High history,
Montrel Cummings.</i>

00:16.930 --> 00:18.570
<i>His brother plays
on the team as well,</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:20.170
<i>but he don't get no burn.</i>

00:20.200 --> 00:22.970
Damn, the whole town know
you a bench rider now.

00:23.010 --> 00:25.210
No shit, I'll never
be a legend if I don't

00:25.240 --> 00:27.470
- get off the bench.
- Don't sweat that, pimp.

00:27.510 --> 00:29.050
I feel like we're gonna
get our shots soon,

00:29.080 --> 00:30.480
and when we do,
we're gonna blow up

00:30.510 --> 00:32.680
bigger than Jamal's mom
after eating peanuts.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.220
Ha, ha!

00:34.250 --> 00:36.860
That's funny.
Speaking of moms with big titties.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.120
Hey, Mrs. Milk.

00:38.150 --> 00:40.550
[bleep], marry, kill...
me, Grover, Milk.

00:40.590 --> 00:43.430
That's a good question.
I'd definitely [bleep] Jamal.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.260
Mom, how the hell you gonna
[bleep] Jamal over your own son?

00:46.300 --> 00:47.900
- That's sick.
- I knew you was a thot, Mom.

00:47.930 --> 00:49.470
- It's my body, Milton, my body.
- Sometimes I got to remind

00:49.500 --> 00:51.000
- myself that you're my mom.
- That's sick, Milton.

00:51.030 --> 00:52.400
- Get your life together.
- Mind your business, Milton!

00:54.940 --> 00:57.610
Yeah, that's me, baby.
They retiring my jersey.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.940
So do you want to go for a ride
in my boy's party hearse?

00:59.980 --> 01:02.350
It's got it's own Starbucks,
a Coffee Bean,

01:02.380 --> 01:04.550
a cocoa butter machine,
and an Asian woman

01:04.580 --> 01:05.880
in the back to do your nails.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.920
All thanks to my homey,
Shea Butta.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.350
- Yeah!
- Yeah, that's right.

01:09.390 --> 01:12.190
My hearse is the shit.
It even got a gold-plated bidet.

01:12.220 --> 01:14.547
Aye, can a nigga have some chips?

01:19.530 --> 01:21.330
Ow!
And one.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.030
Two shots at the line,
Black Holes.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.050
Yeah, we're in there.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.280
Yeah...
Oh, God!

01:35.310 --> 01:37.510
Oh! Oh!

Oh, shit, Randy trying

Oh! God!

01:59.100 --> 02:01.000
In adherence with the rules,
the opposing coach

02:01.040 --> 02:02.480
will select another Duncan player

02:02.510 --> 02:04.807

You ain't got off the bench

Now you ain't got to
take that shot,

02:37.690 --> 02:40.130
- 'cause I know you was scurred.
- Scurred?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.560
The strongest part
of my game is shooting

02:41.600 --> 02:43.700
when no one is guarding me.
I would've sunk that bitch

02:43.730 --> 02:45.230
and took us all to the playoffs.

02:45.270 --> 02:47.570
Well, the lights out.

02:54.810 --> 02:56.350
Looks like you got your wish.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.250
Plus you got all day
to think about it.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.720
If you make that shot, my nig,
all our lives change.

03:01.750 --> 03:05.090
Hey, Grover. I had this whole
party planned for after the game,

03:05.120 --> 03:07.190
which you probably didn't know,
'cause you weren't invited,

03:07.220 --> 03:09.660
but since you're the one
who can take us to the playoffs,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.260
it'd be wrong if you weren't there.

03:11.290 --> 03:13.190
- Can my boys come?
- I don't know.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.730
Milk creeps everybody out.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.900
- And the fat one...
- Hey, bitch. I'm standing right here.

03:17.935 --> 03:20.340
Oh, it's dark.
I didn't see you.

03:20.370 --> 03:22.240
Yeah, they can come.

03:22.270 --> 03:26.310
See, my nigs, our lives
is matriculating already.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.510
<i> Damn it, DMX, are you
a father or a drug addict?</i>

03:29.550 --> 03:32.020
<i>You don't need crack.
You need Jesus.</i>

03:32.050 --> 03:33.590
Jefe, why do you like this show

03:33.620 --> 03:35.390
with the gay black man
giving advice?

03:35.420 --> 03:37.190
- It's boring, holmes.
- That's Iyanla.

03:37.220 --> 03:38.920
She's the only one on TV
still brave enough

03:38.960 --> 03:41.060
to care about black people.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.230
Is your brother Montrel
playing games again?

03:43.260 --> 03:45.930
- This isn't funny, boss.
- Nah, he's not even here.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.400
And I know I paid the power bill.

03:48.430 --> 03:51.740
- Hey, the lights are out all over the city.
- Except for the hills.

03:51.770 --> 03:53.840
<i>Why do they still have power
up there, ese?</i>

03:53.940 --> 03:55.740
I don't know anything
about the hills.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.510
I've never been above sea level.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.210
I'll tell you why.
'Cause they're white.

04:03.230 --> 04:06.900
Look at this. We finally invited
to one of Cindy's parties.

04:06.930 --> 04:09.370
Now don't do nothing stupid
and get us kicked out, Milk.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.740
Yeah, you heard Cindy say
you was creepy.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.340
Nah, she said she want
to creep with your boy

04:13.370 --> 04:15.940
- and do some smashing.
- That ain't what she said.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.480
- That is what she said.
- That's not what she said.

04:17.510 --> 04:19.610
- Why you always be hating?
- You out of your goddamn mind.

04:19.649 --> 04:22.150
That's why no one came
to your birthday party.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.880
We haven't been in here
five seconds,

04:23.920 --> 04:26.260
and y'all both acting like
a bunch of Meek Mills.

04:26.290 --> 04:27.960
Let's just slide in here unnoticed,

04:28.050 --> 04:30.350
holler at Cindy,
maybe get some free throw love,

04:30.390 --> 04:33.130
and get out of here before
anybody see us.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.260
Aye, it's Grover.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.230
Fall back, my nig.
We was invited.

04:36.260 --> 04:38.060
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
It's all good, Grover.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.300
We glad you here.
You about to be the man.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.370
I am?
That's right, I am.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.070
As soon as you sink that free
throw and send us to the playoff.

04:45.105 --> 04:47.410
You goddamn right!
Don't even worry about him.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.680
He got Icy Hot running
through his veins.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.650
You got it. You know I
ain't gonna let you down.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.550
Who you know fresher than Grover?
Small thing to a giant.

04:56.580 --> 04:59.220
I can't believe this shit.
I carried this team all season.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.390
And now this little shithead
is gonna steal my shine.

05:01.420 --> 05:02.620
We should go [bleep] him up.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.560
Right, guys? R-Right?

05:04.590 --> 05:07.360
Where'd you guys go?
You know I can't turn.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.260
Seriously,
it's not fun anymore, guys.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.240
I think I'ma holler
at A'pos'trafee'a.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.810
I mean, she ain't a dime, but shit.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.570
A nickel trumps a penny every day.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.700
It's too bad you ain't
the color of a penny,

05:17.740 --> 05:20.640
'cause I don't think
she into your shade, my nig.

05:20.670 --> 05:24.315
Damn, Jamal, why you always
hating on my light skindidness?

05:25.410 --> 05:27.920
Aye, girl. You ever had
milk shoot out your nose?

05:27.950 --> 05:29.820
Or in your mouth?

05:29.850 --> 05:31.750
Wait, he's one of Grover's boys.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.750
If he makes that shot,
they're gonna be popular.

05:34.790 --> 05:37.060
- Oh, okay.
- That's what I thought.

05:37.090 --> 05:40.400
Okay, white boy, you got our
attention, so what you working with?

05:40.430 --> 05:42.170
A soft eight or a hard nine.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.440
That's up to you,
thirsty-ass beezy.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.070
You becoming the man
is already starting to rub off.

05:49.105 --> 05:50.370
What up, fellas?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.840
I just put out a new batch
of Swedish meat...

05:51.870 --> 05:54.640
<i>Balls!
I'm already there, you heard?</i>

05:54.670 --> 05:57.070
It's cool that Pastor Scrilla
let you use the house like this.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.120
He's out of town
at Hallelujah-pallooza.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.390
His favorite artist
Reverend Run is performing.

06:01.410 --> 06:05.020
Well, praise the Lord, 'cause I'm
crucifixing to get in your pants.

06:05.050 --> 06:08.660
You're so silly, Grover. I'm gonna
let you in on a little secret.

06:08.690 --> 06:10.775
I'm gonna be a free agent
after this season.

06:10.810 --> 06:12.860
Well, I got a max deal
waiting for you.

06:12.890 --> 06:14.590
Just let me know when you're
ready to sign.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.870
Uh, we'll see.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.870
Let's dance.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.570
Hey, you gonna let Grover
go over there and push up

06:21.600 --> 06:23.240
on your girl on some
Derrick Fisher type shit?

06:23.270 --> 06:25.670
Hells no, Mumblemouth.
I got a plan.

06:25.710 --> 06:28.610
This time, we're gonna take down
the shit crew once and for all.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.910
Now all I need is...

06:30.940 --> 06:33.679
Aw, come the [bleep] on, guys!

06:36.970 --> 06:38.640
Today's the day, big guy.

06:38.670 --> 06:41.340
Today, the legend begins.

06:41.370 --> 06:42.340
Damn, Montrel.

06:42.370 --> 06:44.650
Didn't Mom say to stop
bringing caskets in the house?

06:44.680 --> 06:45.980
Oh, wait, this ain't mine.

06:46.010 --> 06:47.410
It's from Shea's party hearse.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.220
Since I had to take
my other suit back,

06:49.250 --> 06:52.420
- I had to borrow one off this nigga.
- We about to get turnt up.

06:52.450 --> 06:54.620
'Cause of the delay,
all of Montrel's teammates

06:54.650 --> 06:56.390
flew in for the jersey
retirement ceremony.

06:56.420 --> 07:00.260
Yeah, that's right. The party ain't
gonna stop till the casket drop.

07:00.290 --> 07:02.630
Yeah!

07:02.660 --> 07:04.530
All right, you ready
for tonight, caa?

07:04.560 --> 07:06.030
Yeah, Shea, I stay ready.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.630
It's about to be two legends
in the house.

07:07.670 --> 07:10.370
Legends? All you have to
do is make a free throw?

07:10.400 --> 07:11.770
Anybody can do that.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.140
Hell, they let the mascot
shoot from half court

07:14.170 --> 07:17.010
blindfolded ... on a trampoline ...
on fire.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.210
Say the word, caa.
I'll light you up.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.940
Y'all just jealous I'm in
the same league as y'all.

07:20.980 --> 07:23.550
Jealous? Nigga, I was
the top league scorer

07:23.580 --> 07:26.920
in the AC Green Sta-Soft-Fro
All Star Invitational.

07:26.950 --> 07:28.050
I was the shit!

07:28.090 --> 07:29.760
That sound like
a buster league to me.

07:29.790 --> 07:32.030
You try averaging 25 points a game

07:32.060 --> 07:34.060
with curl activator all over the ball.

07:34.090 --> 07:36.390
First of all, what the [bleep]
is curl activator?

07:36.430 --> 07:38.300
And secondly, I don't care
what's on the ball.

07:38.330 --> 07:41.500
Once I sink this shot, I will
no longer be under your shadow.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.670
You really think
you gonna be something, huh?

07:43.700 --> 07:45.940
They don't call it
the charity stripe for nothing.

07:45.975 --> 07:48.950
And if you happen to make this shot,
you'll be lucky, not a legend.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.240
The best you can do
is not [bleep] up.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.480
Aw, shit, dude leaking.
We got to roll, caa.

07:55.950 --> 07:58.550
- You got this, Grover.
- Hey, we're counting on you!

07:58.580 --> 08:00.680
Don't worry, sweet thing,
Grover got you.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.620
<i>I don't know what Montrel's
talking about.</i>

08:02.650 --> 08:04.790
<i>You got to be a legend
to get this kind of love.</i>

08:04.820 --> 08:06.050
<i>It's easy.</i>

08:06.090 --> 08:08.190
<i>Just get up there
and make the shot.</i>

08:14.230 --> 08:16.070
<i>But then again,
I guess it's possible.</i>

08:16.100 --> 08:18.100
<i>Am I crazy for talking to myself?</i>

08:18.140 --> 08:19.780
Everybody know if you
talk to yourself,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.770
it mean you crazy.
Ain't that right, Prince?

08:27.010 --> 08:29.050
Next.
And what's your problem?

08:29.080 --> 08:32.633
Yeah, I paid my bill, but my power
went off last night for like an hour.

08:32.668 --> 08:35.390
Hold on.
LaKeisha, no, I ain't busy.

08:35.419 --> 08:37.590
You saw Gerard with who?

08:37.620 --> 08:40.360
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

08:40.390 --> 08:42.059
Mm-hmm.

08:42.090 --> 08:45.970
- Mm, yup. Mm-hmm.
- My sister, can you just...

08:46.000 --> 08:47.170
you're at work right now.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.770
- Can you just help me?
- Girl, hold on.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.940
This customer is more
worrisome than my kids.

08:50.970 --> 08:53.470
- Oh, you from Chamberlain Heights.
- I know that.

08:53.510 --> 08:55.150
Then you should also know
that rolling blackouts

08:55.170 --> 08:58.140
are affecting everybody
from Don Cornelius Avenue

08:58.180 --> 08:59.820
to Martin Luther King Boulevard.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.940
Sorry. I'm back.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.620
I heard.

09:03.650 --> 09:04.950
He know what he doing with that.

09:04.985 --> 09:06.490
So y'all just gonna
target our people,

09:06.520 --> 09:08.750
leave them in the dark, while
the white neighborhood shine?

09:08.790 --> 09:11.690
- Nah, not on my watch.
- Look, boy, there's a meeting

09:11.720 --> 09:13.420
at the White Power building tonight.

09:13.460 --> 09:17.526
Take your little Nat Turner ass
down there and preach, not here.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.960
You're listening
to "The FREQ-y Deeky Report,"

09:20.970 --> 09:23.240
sponsored by Job Malt Liquor.

09:23.270 --> 09:27.410
Remember, if you can't find work,
you can always get a Job.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.400
But right now, we in the studio

09:29.430 --> 09:32.870

Mr. Grover Cummings, whose...

09:32.900 --> 09:36.800
And I'm Jamal, technical guru.
And I'm announcing it here first.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.280
We coming out with
hot new sneaks, The Greezies.

09:40.310 --> 09:44.040
It's the first free throw shoe ever.
Y'all gonna know about us.

09:44.075 --> 09:45.780
And I'm Milk, the groupie sampler.

09:45.810 --> 09:48.580
No groupie gets to Grover
without seeing your boy first.

09:48.610 --> 09:50.250
Great, let's take some calls.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.850
Caller, you're live on the radio.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.060
<i>Hey, Grover, it's world-famous
Icy Hot pitchman, Shaquille O'Neal.</i>

09:55.090 --> 09:56.190
<i>I've got some free throw advice.</i>

09:56.220 --> 09:57.590
Click.
Next caller.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.390
<i>Aye, man,
I'm from Cuba Gooding Jr. High.</i>

09:59.420 --> 10:00.790
<i>Go Snow Dogs!</i>

10:00.830 --> 10:02.370
<i>And I don't know about
this Grover dude,</i>

10:02.390 --> 10:05.300
<i>but his brother was the shit.
That nigga get bitches.</i>

10:05.330 --> 10:07.200
<i>Maybe instead of retiring
his jersey tomorrow,</i>

10:07.230 --> 10:09.170
<i>he could put it on
and save you Black Holes.</i>

10:09.200 --> 10:10.870
<i>You know, like a hole?</i>

10:10.900 --> 10:12.670
<i>Like a black hole?
Like an asshole.</i>

10:12.700 --> 10:14.400
First of all, kill yourself.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.340
Second of all,
[bleep] Cuba Gooding Jr.,

10:16.370 --> 10:18.110
his movies and his high school.

10:18.140 --> 10:20.110
And thirdly,
I'm guaranteeing my dude

10:20.140 --> 10:22.110
is gonna take us all the way
to the championship.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.620
- What the hell you doing...
- Oh, shit.

10:23.650 --> 10:26.320
Grover just guaranteed
he's taking Duncan

10:26.350 --> 10:28.920
- to the championship.
- Hold up. I never said...

10:28.950 --> 10:31.490
And he's gonna do it all
wearing The Greezies.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.260
Check out our kicks' Kickstarter

10:33.290 --> 10:36.030
so you can holler at some pimps.

10:36.060 --> 10:39.540
Well, Grover, in a couple of
hours, all eyes will be on you.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.160
So you better make it do
what it do.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.600
And I don't know about you,
but I'd be shaking like

10:43.601 --> 10:45.540
Terrence Howard's voice
during an orgasm.

10:45.570 --> 10:48.973
My boy got this.
Show her, Grover.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.880
Ow.
Boy, you suck.

10:54.910 --> 10:57.150
Man, [bleep] this.

10:57.180 --> 10:59.761
Oh, shit. Uh... good news.

10:59.796 --> 11:02.267
The Greezies are now half off.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.660
Oh, come on, come on.

11:09.690 --> 11:12.400
Citizens of Chamberlain Heights,
I'm Dick Skilling,

11:12.430 --> 11:14.300
president of the
White Power company.

11:14.330 --> 11:15.700
Mm-hmm, yup.

11:15.730 --> 11:18.230
We are working to remedy
the rolling blackouts,

11:18.270 --> 11:21.070
and we value each
and every one of you,

11:21.105 --> 11:26.220
and I can assure you that our
top priority is your satisfaction.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.780
And to show you how much,
we bought you chicken.

11:28.810 --> 11:31.463
Look at all those buckets over there.

11:33.590 --> 11:34.760
Well, that's about it.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.530
- Thank you for coming out!
- Yup.

11:36.550 --> 11:38.090
Hey, Dick, I have a question.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.020
How are we supposed to be
satisfied when we don't have

11:40.055 --> 11:42.020
the basic means to lead
our day-to-day lives?

11:43.530 --> 11:45.600
Well, if you need help,
that's what family is for.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.053
- Thanks again for coming out.
- Gone are the days

11:48.184 --> 11:49.370
of the system putting
the black community last.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.100
Which is why we're working
so diligently to remedy...

11:52.140 --> 11:55.040
We're gonna take the power back.
And we demand justice!

11:55.075 --> 11:56.840
<i>- Yes!
- Little bastard.</i>

11:56.880 --> 11:59.250
You don't have the power
to demand anything.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.950
Pun intended.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.380
We're not gonna take this anymore.
We want answers.

12:05.050 --> 12:06.350
How about a riddle?

12:06.380 --> 12:09.550
What did the evil white man
say to the angry black mob?

12:09.590 --> 12:14.060
- I don't know, dude. What?
- Uh, bye!

12:14.090 --> 12:17.330
- Yup.
- What are we going to do now, boss?

12:17.360 --> 12:19.360
Like I said, we're gonna
take the power back.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.790
The revolution will be Snapchatted.

12:24.850 --> 12:26.620
I see you, Jamal.

12:26.650 --> 12:28.750
You got everybody out here
repping The Greezies.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.430
I'm caked up
like Rick Ross' arteries.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.830
Hey, papi.
I like what you working with.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.830
No offense, but once you go wigger,
you can't get with this nigga.

12:37.870 --> 12:39.710
Aye, Darius,
I'm glad y'all came out

12:39.730 --> 12:41.770
to my jersey retirement,
you feel me?

12:41.800 --> 12:43.500
You know we was gonna
hold you down, my G.

12:43.540 --> 12:45.880
Montrel, my main man, what's up?

12:45.910 --> 12:48.510
- Pow!
- Ah! Shit. Yeah.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.240
Nigga got a soft-ass neck, caa.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.350
What your bitch-ass want?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.350
Ah, I just wanted to tell Montrel

12:54.380 --> 12:57.690
- he must be proud of his little bro.
- Man, shit, he all right.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.190
Oh, he's gonna be more than
all right if he makes this shot.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.090
Man, why is everybody tripping
on this shot?

13:02.120 --> 13:05.260
They need to be tripping on the
after party for my jersey retirement.

13:05.290 --> 13:08.730
I'm just saying, he's got a chance
to do something you've never done:

13:08.760 --> 13:11.440
- take Duncan to the playoffs.
- Oh, what?

13:11.470 --> 13:12.640
You bringing that up?

13:12.670 --> 13:14.510
Let me slap this nigga
one more again, caa.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.410
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
let him live, Shea.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.680
Everybody knows I'm the best
player that's ever played at Duncan.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.980
I mean, if anybody's jersey deserves
to be in the rafters, it's yours.

13:23.015 --> 13:24.720
But if he makes that shot,
it's gonna be

13:24.750 --> 13:26.590
out with the old,
in with the new.

13:26.610 --> 13:30.200
Oh, it's like that, Randy?
Shea, you know what to do.

13:32.350 --> 13:34.790
<i>Oh! Heh, yeah.</i>

13:34.820 --> 13:36.620
Aye, you sure you can
get us in, Rodrigo?

13:36.660 --> 13:39.990
I'm Mexican, holmes.
I can get us in anything and stuff.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.130
<i>Que pasá, Téo? </i>

13:43.160 --> 13:47.440
Hola, Rodrigito.
Don't steal anything.

13:47.670 --> 13:50.010
And now,
let's bring up the reason

13:50.040 --> 13:53.440
why we're here,
Grover mother[bleep] Cummings.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.620
- Man, where the [bleep] is he at?
- Grover didn't show up?

13:58.650 --> 14:00.550
I ain't seen him
since the radio station.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.050
Yo, 'Trel, what's up with your
little brother, Grove, man?

14:03.080 --> 14:05.486
Aye, he's probably scared.
He ain't like us.

14:05.521 --> 14:07.090
He's a pussy.
You know what I'm saying?

14:07.120 --> 14:10.090
Wow, you're still a dick.
Selfish-ass Montrel.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.060
This is why we never voted you
team captain.

14:12.090 --> 14:15.300
Man, y'all just getting soft.
It's just a damn free throw!

14:15.330 --> 14:17.500
It's about me
and my accomplishments.

14:17.530 --> 14:19.170
Aye, you want to head back to
the crib and hit this dohja?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.940
Nah, man.
I got a client meeting in San Jose.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.480
Yeah, and I gots to be
in court tomorrow.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.210
Same old Darius.
What you in for this time?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.440
Mother[bleep], I'm a lawyer.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.880
- Oh, word?
- Yeah.

14:28.980 --> 14:30.980
Catch you later, man.
Don't change.

14:31.015 --> 14:33.324
Not that I expect that to happen.

14:36.580 --> 14:39.090
We're in, boss.
What exactly are you looking for?

14:39.120 --> 14:40.350
I'll know it when I see it.

14:40.390 --> 14:41.990
Sometimes,
you don't make sense, boss.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.220
Aha! See?

14:43.260 --> 14:45.580
These Saltines have been
intentionally shorting the black

14:45.581 --> 14:47.900
side of town so they can send
more power to the white areas.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.700
Then, they borrow power
from another city

14:49.730 --> 14:51.730
and dole it out to us
at jacked-up prices.

14:51.770 --> 14:52.840
What's that mean?

14:52.870 --> 14:54.510
Code white! Code white!

14:54.540 --> 14:57.276
Put everything on a jump drive
and let's get out of here.

14:59.610 --> 15:02.680
You again. I should've
assumed you were a thief.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.110
What we gonna do now, boss?

15:04.150 --> 15:06.549
Look!
More angry black people.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.520
- Damn.
- Yo, Grover, our bad.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.900
I guess we got too caught up
in your limelight.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.130
You had more pressure on you than
Steve Harvey reading cue cards.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.070
Just know, whatever happens,
we got your back.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.740
Yeah, who needs a bunch
of big booty

15:24.770 --> 15:26.470
brown bitches bouncing
on they nine?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.300
You guys do.
We all do.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.540
This is an opportunity for us
to get off the bench.

15:30.570 --> 15:32.640
And if I don't make this shot,

15:32.670 --> 15:34.410
Milk, you'll stay a virgin,
and Jamal,

15:34.440 --> 15:36.040
you'll go back to just being fat.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.750
Maybe I just won't take
the free throw.

15:37.780 --> 15:40.890
Then you'll be Montrel's bitch-ass
little brother forever.

15:40.980 --> 15:44.720
The lights is back on.
What you gonna do, my nig?

15:44.750 --> 15:47.760
Well, I'm definitely
not a bitch-ass. Let's go.

15:52.090 --> 15:54.990
I think we're good.

15:56.230 --> 15:58.300
<i>Thank God the lights are back on.</i>

15:58.330 --> 16:03.000
<i>I would've never found
your black ass in the dark.</i>

16:03.035 --> 16:04.370
Tsk, tsk, children.

16:04.410 --> 16:07.180
This is what happens when
you play grown-up games.

16:07.210 --> 16:09.710
Wait, don't shoot.
Look, I know what you're up to.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.410
And you're not gonna
get away with it.

16:11.450 --> 16:14.450
- Looks like I already did.
- Dick, man, come on, now.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.480
You know you out here
overcharging poor people.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.390
Your greed is gonna end up
being the downfall of us all.

16:19.420 --> 16:22.790
This country was built
off greed and guns.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.350
Speaking of which...

16:24.390 --> 16:27.951
Look, if you shoot us, then the
world will know what your plan is.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.300
I'm recording it.
You make one more move,

16:29.301 --> 16:31.560
I'll push this button
and send it straight to Snapchat.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.970
And don't get it twisted.
I got mad followers.

16:34.005 --> 16:35.970
Then what do you want?
Money?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.170
I want you to return the power
to the people.

16:38.210 --> 16:41.210
I hate you so much right now.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.980
Okay, how can I trust that this
is all over once I do my part?

16:45.010 --> 16:48.150
You can't, and that's the beauty of it.
That feeling you feel?

16:48.180 --> 16:49.980
That's just a small taste
of what it's like to be black.

16:50.020 --> 16:51.820
But I can't trust that you're
gonna do what you say you're...

16:51.850 --> 16:54.260
Listen, Dick, this is the deal.
I'll hand over the jump drive

16:54.290 --> 16:55.990
as soon as we
have our power back.

16:56.020 --> 16:57.990
You have a deal.

16:58.025 --> 17:00.590
You may have won this round,
you little black,

17:00.630 --> 17:03.470
brown, and yellow bastards,
but I'll be back.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.440
I'll be back!

17:15.380 --> 17:17.880
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Number 54 will be taking the shot.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.950
Come on, mother[bleep],
get this shit over with.

17:22.984 --> 17:25.690
"Hoarders" is about to come on,
and it's a marathon.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.600
<i>Grover, Grover, Grover,
Grover, Grover,</i>

17:33.630 --> 17:35.630
<i>Grover, Grover, Grover...</i>

17:35.660 --> 17:37.360
Aye, Shea, you think I'm a dick?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.540
Aye, you not coming out to me, right?

17:39.570 --> 17:42.970
All I'm saying, Shea,
is that I earned my jersey retirement.

17:43.005 --> 17:45.140
- Why I got to share it with him?
- I don't know, caa.

17:45.170 --> 17:46.740
I try to be a good big brother

17:46.770 --> 17:49.210
to this little mother[bleep],
but what about my needs?

17:49.240 --> 17:51.540
Can't 'Trel get some love?
Is that so wrong?

17:51.580 --> 17:54.020
Aye, if you got to ask, caa,
then it probably is.

17:54.050 --> 17:55.350
Now, will you shut the [bleep] up?

17:55.380 --> 17:59.580
<i>Grover, Grover, Grover,
Grover, Grover,</i>

17:59.620 --> 18:02.290
<i>Grover, Grover, Grover...</i>

18:04.760 --> 18:06.660
Aye, your brother
don't look right, caa.

18:15.740 --> 18:18.740
God damn it,
I'm not coming back tomorrow!

18:18.570 --> 18:22.410
- Aye, Grover, Grover, wake up!
- Aye, man, what happened?

18:22.440 --> 18:25.010
Man, you can't stand up there
trembling like a bitch.

18:25.050 --> 18:26.950
You got the opportunity
to do something

18:26.985 --> 18:28.750
that Duncan has never done before.

18:28.780 --> 18:30.450
All you got to do is step up there,

18:30.490 --> 18:32.530
grab your dick,
and do the damn thing.

18:32.550 --> 18:35.590
'Cause real talk, I didn't get it done.
So it's up to you.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.330
What if I miss? Then I'll go
back to being in your shadow.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.830
Aye, listen to me.

18:39.860 --> 18:42.600
And this is coming straight
from the heart sincerely.

18:42.630 --> 18:45.970
You ain't as good as me.
You never will be as good as me.

18:46.005 --> 18:48.310
You'll never be the ball player
that I am.

18:48.340 --> 18:51.440
But you can be the ball player
that you was meant to be.

18:51.470 --> 18:55.070
- Thanks, Montrel.
- Stop looking at me like that.

18:55.110 --> 18:57.850
Aye, you ready for a nigga
to put this fuse back in, caa?

18:57.880 --> 19:01.110
- Montrel, you turned the lights off?
- Man, get your ass out there!

19:01.150 --> 19:04.050
The team is waiting on you.
Kick rocks.

19:05.590 --> 19:08.890
<i>Grover, Grover...</i>

19:26.940 --> 19:28.140
<i> Legend!</i>

19:28.180 --> 19:31.280
- Yeah!
- That's my little brother, though.

19:31.310 --> 19:34.235
Aye, I know you ain't crying,
mother[bleep].

19:37.750 --> 19:39.820
Man, our first playoff game?

19:39.850 --> 19:43.630
- We definitely about to get our nuts.
- Not only that.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.200
Cindy agreed to go out
with your boy.

19:45.230 --> 19:47.230
So I'm about to punch
my V-card tonight.

19:47.260 --> 19:50.470
That make two of us.
But I'm going for my V and my A.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.440
Just think of where we were
a year ago.

19:52.470 --> 19:54.840
We finally legends, my nigs.

19:54.870 --> 20:00.210
<i>And making his
starting debut at guard,</i>

20:00.240 --> 20:03.340
<i>Grover Cummings!</i>

20:03.380 --> 20:07.350
All right, my nigs.
It's time to make history.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.650
<i>Grover went on
to start his first playoff game.</i>

20:10.680 --> 20:13.320
<i>Duncan lost 130 to 12.</i>

20:13.350 --> 20:15.990
<i>However, Grover did score two points.</i>

20:16.020 --> 20:18.490
<i>Unfortunately,
it was for the other team.</i>

20:18.530 --> 20:22.070
<i>Needless to say, Cindy did
not go out with him that night.</i>

20:22.100 --> 20:24.600
<i>Milk did go home with some
brown round.</i>

20:24.630 --> 20:26.100
<i>It was Rhiyoncé.</i>

20:26.130 --> 20:28.530
<i>Unfortunately,
she had a headache that night,</i>

20:28.570 --> 20:30.370
<i>so he ain't get no ass.</i>

20:30.400 --> 20:33.400
<i>Jamal celebrated his new-found
wealth at Pie-HOP.</i>

20:33.440 --> 20:36.840
<i>Unfortunately, he was robbed
of his cash and his merch.</i>

20:36.880 --> 20:38.110
<i>Dumb bitch.</i>

20:38.150 --> 20:40.490
<i>Montrel decided to turn
his life around,</i>

20:40.510 --> 20:42.680
<i>and he applied for several jobs.</i>

20:42.720 --> 20:45.120
<i>Ten minutes later,
he used the applications</i>

20:45.150 --> 20:49.190
<i>to roll joints and fell asleep
on the couch, like a real nigga.</i>

20:50.021 --> 20:54.320

20:55.550 --> 20:57.720
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.630
Mm-hmm, yup.

20:59.660 --> 21:02.730
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.930
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm, yup.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.900
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

21:08.930 --> 21:09.860
Mm!
