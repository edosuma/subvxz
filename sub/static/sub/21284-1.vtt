me like an adult?

out with, everything!

one decision on my own!

07:27.948 --> 07:31.018
Can you please tell her to stop
treating me like an infant?

07:31.051 --> 07:33.721
Your mother loves you
very, very much.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.657

to do what she did.

- Sure.

her around like this.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.730
You told me.

Then you of all people
should understand

I do, but what I don't
understand is

so overprotective all the time!

I am so sorry

10:51.018 --> 10:52.119

10:52.152 --> 10:55.255
That was so embarrassing.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.857
You know what I think?

10:56.890 --> 10:57.991
I think she has a point.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.093
You do?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.229
I mean, if I had a daughter
in high school,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.965
I wouldn't want her going
to frat parties, either.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.033

No.

This is so humiliating.

I can't believe
you're doing this.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.310

you weren't gonna see him again.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.047
You said that!
I never promised anything!

11:54.081 --> 11:55.916
Tucker, you need to date
girls your own age.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.085
- You have no right to do this.
- He has no right

11:58.118 --> 11:59.953

- I could have you

12:01.488 --> 12:02.823

20:46.479 --> 20:49.449
[♪♪]

20:49.482 --> 20:50.517
That's horrible.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.319
[♪♪]

20:52.352 --> 20:53.520
[crying]

20:53.553 --> 20:55.922
[dramatic music]

20:55.955 --> 21:03.955
[♪♪]

21:12.772 --> 21:14.874
[Maddy]
I want every girl in this room

21:14.907 --> 21:18.745
to take a long look
at this cheating scumbag!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.547
Remember this face!

21:20.580 --> 21:22.549
- That's enough.
- Don't you ever touch me.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.085
[clattering]

21:26.118 --> 21:28.621
Want to tell us what was
goin' on there, Maddy?

21:28.655 --> 21:31.858
I was told that Tucker was
hooking up with this other girl,

21:32.859 --> 21:34.427
so I got really upset.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.429
Obviously.

21:36.463 --> 21:40.066
Uh, look, I know that
that video looks really bad,

21:40.099 --> 21:41.934
but I... I didn't kill him.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.336
- Maddy...
- No.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.805
I was falling in
love with him, okay?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.807
And he keeps looking
at me like I did it!

21:47.840 --> 21:50.543
I didn't do it!

21:50.577 --> 21:52.555
We're just trying to put
it all together, that's all.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.681
[somber music]

21:54.714 --> 21:56.516
When was the last time
you saw Tucker?

21:56.549 --> 21:57.750
The next night.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.818
Saturday.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.852
Everything was fine.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.488
[♪♪]

22:01.521 --> 22:02.855
Uh...

22:02.889 --> 22:04.757
He came over,

22:04.791 --> 22:08.828
and, uh, he parked
around the corner.

22:08.861 --> 22:09.996
Called me from his car.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.063
So, um...

22:11.097 --> 22:12.832
[♪♪]

22:12.865 --> 22:15.635
I snuck out to talk
to him for a little bit.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.504
"Snuck out?"

22:17.537 --> 22:20.039
Why are you sneaking
out of your own house?

22:20.072 --> 22:22.192
[Claire] I didn't approve of
Maddy going out with him.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.511
I followed her.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.112
I saw the whole conversation.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.047
Sounds like you're being
stalked by your mother.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.851
[♪♪]

22:31.884 --> 22:33.119
I admit I am a bit...

22:33.920 --> 22:35.455
overprotective.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.624
What time was this when you
met him on the street?

22:37.657 --> 22:38.858
Uh, nine.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.060
I came right home after.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.431
You didn't go back to his place
just to be with him?

22:44.464 --> 22:45.932
She was here that whole time.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.600
How would you know?

22:47.634 --> 22:48.768
You were out of town, right?

22:48.801 --> 22:50.637
Well, Claire was home all night.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.904
Right, babe?

22:51.938 --> 22:52.872
That's right.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.807
[dark music]

22:54.841 --> 22:57.444
Maddy was inside
the house all night.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.045
[Detective Kelly]
Right.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.813
Except for that one time
she snuck out.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.015
Hm.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.884
Well, I am gonna have
to have my team

23:04.917 --> 23:05.752
look through the house

23:05.785 --> 23:06.753
and do a forensics check

23:06.786 --> 23:08.421
on Maddy's car.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.056
Also, with your
parent's permission,

23:10.089 --> 23:11.791
we need to take
your fingerprints.

23:11.824 --> 23:12.625
[Sean]
Okay.

23:12.659 --> 23:15.027
[dramatic music]

23:15.061 --> 23:23.061
[♪♪]

23:52.999 --> 23:54.233
[suspenseful music]

23:54.266 --> 23:55.802
Hi. You hungry?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.136
Want me to make us some lunch?

23:57.169 --> 24:00.973
[♪♪]

24:01.007 --> 24:02.041
Where did you go?

24:02.074 --> 24:05.712
[♪♪]

24:05.745 --> 24:07.046
What are you talking about?

24:07.079 --> 24:10.016
After I saw Tucker on the
street, I came home.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.522
Twenty minutes later
you left the house.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.890
You were gone for
a couple hours.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.593
[♪♪]

24:20.627 --> 24:21.594
Where did you go?

24:21.628 --> 24:23.229
[♪♪]

24:23.262 --> 24:24.664
I just...

24:25.297 --> 24:26.599
[laughs]

24:26.633 --> 24:27.934
You know...

24:27.967 --> 24:29.502
just went for a drive.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.170
Clear my head.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.706
[♪♪]

24:33.740 --> 24:34.950
Grilled cheese and
tomato soup okay?

24:34.974 --> 24:41.681
[♪♪]

24:41.714 --> 24:43.225
[female announcer]
As we make our final descent,

24:43.249 --> 24:45.284
please make sure your seat
backs and tray tables

24:45.317 --> 24:46.953
are in their full
upright position

24:46.986 --> 24:48.855
and your seat belts
are fastened.

24:48.888 --> 24:49.956
Welcome to Los Angeles.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.079
[Detective Kelly] Does Maddy
have a tendency to get...

24:55.595 --> 24:56.863
violent?

24:56.896 --> 24:58.665
No, never.

24:58.698 --> 25:01.668
She kinda went nuts at that
party, don't you think?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.803
Give her a break, I mean,
that girl was practically

25:03.836 --> 25:05.672
doing a strip tease
with her boyfriend.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.850
[Detective Kelly] Why tell Maddy
about Tucker and this other girl?

25:07.874 --> 25:08.841
Excuse me?

25:08.875 --> 25:10.076
Knew she'd get upset.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.343
What's the point?

25:11.377 --> 25:13.780
[Gina] If my boyfriend was
messing around with some girl,

25:13.813 --> 25:14.957
and Maddy found out about it,

25:14.981 --> 25:16.649
I would expect her
to have my back.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.950
That's... that's what friends

25:17.984 --> 25:19.552
do for each other.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.653
When'd you leave town?

25:20.687 --> 25:23.623
Uh, the day after the party.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.957
Gonna need proof of that trip.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.561
What... like...

25:28.595 --> 25:30.172
like a statement from
someone on the plane?

25:30.196 --> 25:32.599
I mean, I... I can't get that!

25:32.632 --> 25:33.700
How about a boarding pass?

25:34.233 --> 25:35.167
Oh.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.268
Right. Sorry.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.575
Here's my boarding card
from LA to New York...

25:43.743 --> 25:44.744
and the returning trip.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.915
Oh, and here's my receipt
from the hotel

25:48.948 --> 25:50.082
I stayed at in Tribeca.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.220
Looks like an alibi.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.055
Thank you.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.258
So...

25:59.291 --> 26:00.593
who do you think did it?

26:03.095 --> 26:05.798
[dark music]

26:05.832 --> 26:13.832
[♪♪]

26:15.842 --> 26:17.677
Recognize these?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.350
Yeah, I've been looking
all over for them.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.056
- Where did you...
- Maddy, don't say anything more.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.314
Gardener dug 'em out

26:22.348 --> 26:24.316
three blocks
from the crime scene.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.285
They've got your fingerprints
all over 'em.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.054
And this blood here?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.989
Matches Tucker's DNA.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.366
We also found some
of Tucker's blood

26:31.390 --> 26:34.226
on the driver side
door handle of your car.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.863
What's his blood doin'
all over your stuff, Maddy?

26:36.896 --> 26:40.366
[♪♪]

26:40.399 --> 26:42.201
You want to tell us
what really happened?

26:42.234 --> 26:44.412
She's not saying anything
without a lawyer being present.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.972
Okay, I'll take a shot.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.107
You were mad at Tucker
for cheating on you.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.677
You snuck out of the house when
your mother wasn't looking.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.412
You went over to his place,
killed him with these scissors,

26:53.445 --> 26:55.047
then as you were driving away

26:55.081 --> 26:56.382
you threw 'em
out the car window.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.017
- Oh wait, that's crazy.
- Not...

26:58.050 --> 26:59.719
I wasn't even near the house
that night!

26:59.752 --> 27:00.687
- Another word, Maddy.
- Mom,

27:00.720 --> 27:01.954
you need to tell him...

27:01.988 --> 27:03.065
[Detective Kelly]
Maddy Beauregard,

27:03.089 --> 27:03.990
you are under arrest...

27:04.023 --> 27:05.958
Maddy, no!

27:05.992 --> 27:06.926
[Detective Kelly]
Get her!

27:06.959 --> 27:08.427
Maddy, stop!

27:08.460 --> 27:09.696
Don't do this.

27:09.729 --> 27:12.098
[dramatic music]

27:12.131 --> 27:13.766
[♪♪]

27:13.800 --> 27:14.400
Maddy!

27:14.433 --> 27:17.003
[♪♪]

27:17.036 --> 27:17.837
[cop #1]
Hey!

27:17.870 --> 27:19.105
[♪♪]

27:19.138 --> 27:19.839
[Detective Kelly]
Stop!

27:19.872 --> 27:20.840
[♪♪]

27:20.873 --> 27:21.874
Come back here.

27:21.908 --> 27:29.908
[♪♪]

27:36.388 --> 27:37.757
[grunting]

27:38.725 --> 27:43.730
[♪♪]

27:43.763 --> 27:44.803
- Mom!
- You have the right

27:44.831 --> 27:46.032
- to remain silent.
- Mom!

27:46.065 --> 27:47.734
Anything you say can
and will be used

27:47.767 --> 27:49.344
- against you...
- You know what happened!

27:49.368 --> 27:52.038
- You have the right...
- You know! Just tell them!

27:52.071 --> 27:53.782
[Detective Kelly] If you
cannot afford an attorney,

27:53.806 --> 27:55.407
one will be provided for you.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.677
Do you understand these rights
as I have explained them to you?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.148
[Sean]
She's a minor.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.084
I mean, they can't put her on
trial as an adult, can they?

28:05.117 --> 28:07.386
They can and they will.

28:07.419 --> 28:10.222
But the bottom line is,
she never left the house.

28:10.256 --> 28:13.292
Claire can testify that Maddy
was home the entire night.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.327
I mean, you can't
tell me that that's irrelevant.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.201
I'm... no, I'm not saying
that it's irrelevant.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.298
What I'm saying is that
the jury will expect

28:19.331 --> 28:21.167
the mother to cover for her.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.202
Show me a mom who wouldn't.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.213
Then what about the way the cops
collected the evidence?

28:25.237 --> 28:26.281
The blood, the fingerprints.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.239
They must've screwed up

28:27.273 --> 28:28.340
somewhere along the line.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.308
[Parker]
It's textbook.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.377
They did their job right.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.080
Look, it's her first offense,

28:34.113 --> 28:36.215
so that works to our advantage.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.885
We need to show that
Tucker threatened her,

28:38.918 --> 28:40.452
and she feared for her life.

28:40.486 --> 28:43.355
[Sean] You mean, like, she
did it in self defense?

28:43.389 --> 28:46.225
- Yeah.
- But she was not even there.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.995
[Parker] Our best defense is
involuntary manslaughter,

28:49.028 --> 28:51.363
which on a good day
with a good judge

28:51.397 --> 28:54.200
is a two year sentence,
if we're lucky.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.768
Can I talk to you in private?

28:55.802 --> 28:59.238
[♪♪]

28:59.271 --> 29:00.506
Maddy, what's goin' on?

29:00.539 --> 29:02.274
[Maddy]
You're my lawyer, right?

29:02.308 --> 29:04.443
I can talk to you without
my parents in the room?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.112
[♪♪]

29:06.145 --> 29:06.913
Yeah.

29:06.946 --> 29:14.946
[♪♪]

29:25.031 --> 29:26.032
My mother did it.

29:26.532 --> 29:27.867
What?

29:27.900 --> 29:30.002
She killed Tucker.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.939
Okay, Maddy, I know that
you're mad at your mother

29:32.972 --> 29:34.316
because she didn't
like your boyfriend,

29:34.340 --> 29:35.141
but this isn't...

29:35.174 --> 29:36.909
No, she follows me

29:36.943 --> 29:38.510
all the time.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.112
She threatened to kill him!

29:40.146 --> 29:42.148
But people just say that
when they're upset...

29:42.181 --> 29:44.283
No, on the night of the murder

29:44.316 --> 29:48.054
my mom was gone for two hours.
Same time Tucker died.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.389
I think she took the scissors
from the desk in my room,

29:50.422 --> 29:51.499
went to Tucker's house, and...

29:51.523 --> 29:52.558
Well, then why weren't

29:52.591 --> 29:55.194
her fingerprints
on the scissors?

29:55.227 --> 29:57.396
Because she's trying
to frame me.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.898
And why would she do that?

29:58.931 --> 30:00.299
[Maddy]
She's insane.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.001
Crazy people do crazy things.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.836
[Parker]
Okay, Maddy.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.905
You're scared.
I get that.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.607
I've defended a lot of women
that are in your position.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.277
But going against
your mother right now

30:11.310 --> 30:12.879
is not gonna help us.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.547
If anything, you two have
got to stand by each other.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.917
I need you to find out where
she went that night.

30:17.950 --> 30:18.950
Stop.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.586
I'm your lawyer,

30:20.619 --> 30:22.021
I'm not a detective.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.223
Then get a private detective!

30:24.256 --> 30:26.034
Follow her around, go through
her phone records.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.359
- I'm not hiring...
- Whatever!

Nick Fox Investigations,
this is Nick.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.444
How can I help you?

30:45.477 --> 30:47.346
Uh, my name is Maddy Beauregard.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.282
I got your information from
my, uh, roommate,

30:50.316 --> 30:51.550
Shaunequa Washington.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.451
Yeah!

30:52.484 --> 30:54.386
I remember Shaunequa.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.222
How's she doin' these days?

30:56.255 --> 30:57.456
Great!

30:57.489 --> 30:58.925
I wanted to talk to you

30:58.958 --> 31:02.895
about, uh, possibly hiring you?

31:02.929 --> 31:04.964
Well, Ms. Beauregard,

31:04.997 --> 31:07.033
the first thing you need
to know is my rate.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.236
I take an upfront retainer
of five hundred.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.638
Then eighty dollars an hour,
plus expenses.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.473
[Maddy] Mr. Fox, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.476
I am 17 years old,

31:17.509 --> 31:19.078
I go to Lexington High,

31:19.111 --> 31:21.180
and I've just been arrested
for murder.

31:22.314 --> 31:23.615
I don't have that kind of money.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.384
How much money you got?

31:25.417 --> 31:28.587
Three hundred dollars
from my part time job.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.256
I was saving for college.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.457
You got a credit card?

31:31.490 --> 31:32.391
No.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.693
My mom wouldn't let me.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.030
Look, you seem like
a nice, good kid.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.565
What the hell you doin' in jail?

31:39.598 --> 31:40.598
It's a long story.

31:43.169 --> 31:44.703
Will you help me?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.239
You give me the
three hundred dollars,

31:47.273 --> 31:48.474
I'll give you a day.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.507
One day?

31:50.342 --> 31:52.278
All right, two days.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.612
Thanks.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.114
What do you need me to do?

31:56.482 --> 31:58.284
I want you to follow my mother.

Oh, no, no, hold on, lady.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.475
You've got the wrong idea!

33:29.508 --> 33:31.177
- I was just taking her...
- Stop him!

33:31.210 --> 33:34.046
- To the main office.
- He was taking her to his car.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.182
This man is trying
to kidnap my daughter.

No, no, look, relax.

Tell her, I wasn't trying...
I was just trying...

33:41.087 --> 33:43.089
[Claire]
You were trying to kidnap her!

33:43.122 --> 33:44.523
- They fired you?
- Yeah.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.725
- But they can't do that.
- Thanks to that woman

33:46.758 --> 33:49.395
at the library, the whole school
thinks I'm a pedophile.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.097
There's not a school

Oh, hey, what's wrong, sweetie?

I don't like it when you and
Mommy fight all the time.

Oh.

Oh, it's gonna be okay.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.531

Please. It's important.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.746
Look, I'll get right
to the point.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.615
I know you have feelings
for my daughter,

35:49.648 --> 35:51.517
but, come on, Tucker,

35:51.550 --> 35:53.685
she's 17.

35:53.719 --> 35:57.189
She's actually a lot more
mature than you realize.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.690
Look, I love your daughter.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.360
She's in her
last year of high school.

36:01.393 --> 36:05.364
She should be enjoying that
with kids her own age.

If you really love her,
you'll give her that.

Huh?

Hi Mrs. Beauregard.

41:58.584 --> 41:59.584
What do you want, Gina?

42:01.820 --> 42:02.921
I just want to help.

42:06.925 --> 42:07.925
Come on.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.333
It's like the cops have
stopped working on this.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.202
They've got Maddy,
so they've stopped looking

42:17.235 --> 42:18.604
at other possibilities.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.906
Exactly, which is why

42:20.939 --> 42:23.575
it's up to us to prove
that she didn't do this.

42:23.609 --> 42:24.776
What about Tucker's family,

42:24.810 --> 42:26.812
or... or his... his
friends at school?

42:27.846 --> 42:29.114
You think one of them did this?

42:30.849 --> 42:31.983
I don't know.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.686
Someone must've seen
or heard something.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.889
I want to talk
to Tucker's roommate.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.791
Police already talked to him.

42:39.825 --> 42:42.227
Okay, well,
we can't just sit here.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.938
The cops aren't doing
anything to help her,

42:43.962 --> 42:45.831
and you're telling
me that her lawyer

42:45.864 --> 42:47.365
wants her to plead guilty?

42:47.398 --> 42:49.100
That... that's crazy.

42:50.335 --> 42:52.704
Look, Mrs. Beauregard,

42:53.872 --> 42:55.240
she's like my little sister.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.745
I can't let this happen to her!

42:59.778 --> 43:03.615
Right now, she is
in a prison cell all alone,

43:03.649 --> 43:05.917
and there is nobody
to look after her!

43:06.852 --> 43:07.953
There's nobody!

I gotta go to Cleveland,
I got a big meeting there.

43:31.910 --> 43:33.845
- You're not serious.
- Yeah.

43:34.846 --> 43:35.846
Why?

43:36.848 --> 43:38.784
You're going on a business trip?

43:38.817 --> 43:40.151
Your daughter is
sitting in jail,

43:40.185 --> 43:42.320
accused of murder,
and you're leaving town?

43:42.353 --> 43:44.022
Honey, we still have
to pay the bills

43:44.055 --> 43:45.757
regardless of what's
happening with Maddy.

43:46.892 --> 43:47.892
I can't believe you.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.063
- Do you expect me to quit?
- No.

43:52.097 --> 43:55.100
- Then what do you want me to do?
- I want you to help me prove

43:55.133 --> 43:56.134
that she didn't do it.

43:57.903 --> 44:00.238
I'm going to go talk
to Tucker's roommate.

44:00.271 --> 44:01.940
Wait, wait, wait,
what are you gonna do?

44:01.973 --> 44:04.075
Well, Maddy's friend Gina
is gonna meet me there.

44:04.109 --> 44:05.276
You want to join us?

44:05.310 --> 44:06.411
Wait, wait, no.

44:06.444 --> 44:08.013
Look, the lawyer
specifically said

44:08.046 --> 44:10.248
do not talk to anyone
else involved in this.

44:10.281 --> 44:11.917
You could jeopardize
the whole case.

44:11.950 --> 44:13.752
Well, I don't agree.
I think it'll help.

44:13.785 --> 44:15.253
And I'm asking you
to come with me.

44:15.286 --> 44:16.788
Claire, no!

44:16.822 --> 44:19.190
No, we need to
win this in court.

44:19.224 --> 44:20.992
We're not gonna win this by... by

44:21.026 --> 44:23.094
sneaking around like
you always do.

44:23.128 --> 44:25.163
It just doesn't work that way.

44:25.196 --> 44:28.033
So what, you're okay
with Maddy going to jail,

44:28.066 --> 44:29.110
her life completely ruined?

44:29.134 --> 44:30.301
I never said that.

44:30.335 --> 44:31.937
Well, that's how you're acting.

44:31.970 --> 44:33.271
Do you believe she did it?

44:33.304 --> 44:35.206
[Sean]
I don't know what happened.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.375
But the evidence is so stacked
against us it just...

44:37.408 --> 44:38.777
You think she killed him.

44:40.311 --> 44:43.148
Honey, what I think
doesn't matter.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.016
What matters is what
we can prove in court.

44:45.050 --> 44:47.018
- Do you understand that?
- Oh, I understand.

44:47.052 --> 44:48.987
I understand that you'd
rather jump on a plane

44:49.020 --> 44:51.957
than stay here with me and fight
for your daughter's freedom.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.224
That's what I understand!

44:53.258 --> 44:55.326
You're not playing fair,
and you know it.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.963
Now wait. Wait,
could you come back here?

You didn't see or hear
anything suspicious?

48:45.223 --> 48:47.158
I didn't make it a point
to follow him around.

That's your thing.

You've got some attitude.

48:51.496 --> 48:53.231
That's my daughter in jail.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.665
They're accusing
her of murder...

48:54.699 --> 48:56.210

Yeah, and she probably did it!

48:56.234 --> 48:57.702

was my best friend!

to deal with this.

57:05.956 --> 57:07.458
Why did you want me followed?

57:07.492 --> 57:10.160
[♪♪]

57:10.194 --> 57:11.762
Because you killed Tucker.

57:11.796 --> 57:13.464
[♪♪]

57:13.498 --> 57:15.700
You really believe I did that?

57:15.733 --> 57:17.568
[Maddy] Did you go to
his house that night?

57:35.520 --> 57:38.188
[♪♪]

57:38.222 --> 57:40.691
I didn't like the idea of
you dating Tucker, but...

57:40.725 --> 57:42.527
[♪♪]

57:42.560 --> 57:43.561
I didn't kill him.

It depends.

I want you to put my money

59:26.163 --> 59:27.965
and make the record

[news anchor] In a quiet suburb
of Santa Clarita last night,

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:29.093
in what police are describing
as a home invasion

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.761
that turned deadly.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:32.663
Forty-six year old
Sean Beauregard

01:00:32.697 --> 01:00:33.764
was working in his house

01:00:33.798 --> 01:00:35.399
when a man apparently broke in

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.001
and tried to rob him.

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:38.411
Beauregard was taken
to the hospital

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:40.905
where he is in critical
but stable condition.

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:43.073
Beauregard is an executive
at Perfecta Health

We've got him on life support.

He seems to be
leveling off, but...

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:54.885
there's really no way to know

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:56.420
how long he'll be
in this condition.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:59.023
Isn't there anything
else you can do?

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:01.258
Mm, it's all up to him, now.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.460
This could be a very long
process, Claire.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.029
And as head of this hospital

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:07.431
this is something I need
to talk to you about.

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:09.399
Your insurance.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.001
He's only covered for one month

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:13.103
of care at this level
of life support.

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:16.106
After that he'll be transferred
to a private facility,

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.344
and you, Claire, will be
100% responsible for that cost.

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:21.879
How much money are
you talking about?

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:25.916

I will think of something.

[Claire] Somebody hacked
our bank accounts.

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.456
They must have got
our passwords somehow

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:00.533

- It took our computer guys

a while to get access.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:10.500
So we know where the money is?

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:11.568
We can get it back?

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.137
Not exactly.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:15.105
Apparently the money left
your husband's account,

01:06:15.139 --> 01:06:17.041
but never arrived at
the target bank.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:18.608
- What?
- The Imperial Bank

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.245
of the Bahamas has
no record of the transfer.

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:23.547
So what, our money is lost?

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.748
For the time being.

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:25.749
We'll find it.

Oh, great.

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:28.785
That's comforting.

Guess that private detective

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.627
Why would she do that?

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:41.431
Maddy, she... she suspected me
of killing her boyfriend.

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:44.334
[Detective Kelly] Did you have a
personal relationship with Mr. Fox?

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:46.236
- No!
- You weren't home the night

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:47.604
of your husband's robbery.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:48.637
Where were you?

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:50.740
I went to Tucker's house...

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.209
to talk to his roommates.

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:53.810
I wanted to see if I could

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.081
find some clue to help
exonerate my daughter.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:07:00.650
Mrs. Beauregard, you need to
stop playing detective.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.052
- That's my job.
- I will

01:07:02.086 --> 01:07:03.487
when you start doing your job.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.154
Oh...

01:07:04.188 --> 01:07:06.090
[laughs]

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:09.259
Trust me, I've had my hands
full with this one.

01:07:09.293 --> 01:07:12.529
Forensics examined
the crime scene.

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:15.165
We found a bullet fired
from a second gun,

01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:17.534
a weapon legally
registered to Nick Fox.

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:18.802
But no weapon.

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:21.138
Somebody moved it from
the crime scene.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:23.707
We examined the entry wounds
on Nick Fox's body,

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:28.245
and it is very apparent he was
not shot at point blank range.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:30.214
We found three blood types.

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.182
Your husband's, Nick Fox's...

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.651
somebody else.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.052
That can only mean one thing.

01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:38.398
There was a third person
involved

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:39.656
in that shooting last night.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:41.758
I need to get a blood
sample from you.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.661
What are you saying?
That I'm a suspect?

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.839
[Detective Kelly] I'm saying the
forensics are all over the place,

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:48.498
and I'm not rulin' anything out.

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:51.601
[Claire] You think I
framed my own daughter.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:52.636
Don't you see?

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:54.604
Somebody is doing this to me!

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:56.639
All right.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.208
Then you tell me.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.310
Who?

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.115
Who would want to
hurt you like this?

01:08:05.149 --> 01:08:07.517

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:20.197
[Claire]
Maddy!

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.831
- Mommy!
- Maddy!

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:23.399
What are you doing
with my daughter?

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:24.568
Oh, no, no, no, hold on.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.769
You've got the wrong idea.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.203
I... I'm a teacher, I...

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:28.872
I was just taking her
to the main office.

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.241
No, you weren't, you were gonna
take her to your car.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.718
[Underhill] Ma'am, I
wasn't, I assure you.

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:34.310
Hold him while
I call the police.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:35.654
[Underhill]
No, no, look, I didn't know

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.180
where you were.
I saw her.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:39.316
- I was just gonna take her...
- I saw you!

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:40.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look, look.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.220
You've got... she was lost.
I was trying to help her.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:45.322
This man was trying
to kidnap my daughter!

It's Claire Beauregard.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.502

Are you Vanessa Underhill?

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:13.282
Yeah.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:15.684
You remember me?

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:19.288
Mm-hm.

01:09:19.323 --> 01:09:20.424
May I... may I come in?

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:31.868
What do you want?

01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:34.638
Are you trying to hurt me?

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.542
Why would I do that?

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:40.210
Well, it's...

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:42.345
Because of what happened
with your husband.

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:44.281
Oh, my husband.

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:45.849
David.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.618
Yes.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:50.620
He shot himself
right over there.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:51.654
In that corner.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.458
And the blood...

01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:59.396
And they made me clean it up.

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:01.331
They made me clean it up!

Come on, where are you?

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:31.761
Where did you go?
