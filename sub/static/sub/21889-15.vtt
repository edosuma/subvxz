01:06.441 --> 01:08.610
Kimmy, it's eight a.m. in October.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.614
Why are you basting a goose?

01:12.697 --> 01:14.657
I'm making Fernando a Christmas dinner.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.701
I'll take this one.

01:18.119 --> 01:18.953
Why?

01:19.037 --> 01:21.998
Because it's his favorite,
and I want to put him in a good mood.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.585
I'm about to tell him I'm gonna be
your surrogate mom and carry your baby.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.753
He won't be thrilled.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.463
[DJ] Why?

01:28.546 --> 01:30.006
Is it the morning sickness?

01:30.089 --> 01:31.716
The cravings? The mood swings?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.427
Yeah. Fernando gets all those.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.557
His sympathy pains
are worse than my real pains.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.477
He still has to lose
the last five pounds of baby weight.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.981
[Fernando sniffing]

01:47.440 --> 01:50.902
Do I smell a Christmas goose
with all the trimmings?

01:52.821 --> 01:55.448
Either I did something very good,

01:56.032 --> 01:58.409
or you did something very bad.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.332
The reason you're getting a special
Christmas breakfast is because...

02:04.415 --> 02:05.792
I'm gonna have a baby.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.127
[gasps loudly]

02:07.210 --> 02:08.545
[in Spanish] Oh, my God!

02:09.420 --> 02:11.714
[in English] I wanted us
to have another baby!

02:11.798 --> 02:14.217
This is the happiest day!

02:17.137 --> 02:18.638
Before you get too excited,

02:18.721 --> 02:20.181
you should probably know,

02:20.265 --> 02:21.558
the baby is not yours.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.646
[in Spanish] Oh, my God!

02:28.982 --> 02:31.151
[in English] Tell me the name
of this scoundrel!

02:32.610 --> 02:34.654
The father is my brother, Jimmy.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.576
Ew!

02:40.702 --> 02:43.663
That is weird,
even for the Gibbler family.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.791
Jimmy and Stephanie are doing in vitro,

02:46.875 --> 02:48.543
and I'm gonna be their surrogate.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.837
Oh, good.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.673
I don't have to kill anybody.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.760
I am so happy for you.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.305
And I'm so proud of you.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.766
And I'm suddenly so nauseous.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.312
Kimmy, are you nauseous?

03:07.395 --> 03:08.897
I'm not actually pregnant yet.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.525
But just the thought of it
has my ankles swelling.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.070
Oh! And now, here come the cravings.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.906
Where are the pickles?

03:24.787 --> 03:26.414
Don't look at me, I'm hideous!

03:32.629 --> 03:34.672
I'd say he took that pretty well.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.843
Kimmy, this is such a huge thing
that you're doing for me,

03:38.927 --> 03:41.137
I wish there was some way
I could say thank you.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.847
There is.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.558
Why don't you and I
spend the whole day together?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.357
The whole day?

03:53.566 --> 03:55.568
Yeah.
I don't think we've ever done that.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.571
Yeah, there's probably
a good reason for that.

03:59.739 --> 04:04.160
Oh, I love the idea of my best friend
and my sister really bonding.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.456
It will be your Super Surrogate
Soul Sister Saturday.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.876
Wow, you really love to name things.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.836
It's my gift.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.004
Well, you two have fun.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.298
I have been working overtime
covering for Matt

04:17.382 --> 04:19.467
so he can decide
if he's coming back to work.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.969
I just need a day to do diddly.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.431
I'm naming it,
"DJ's Day of Doing Diddly."

04:27.058 --> 04:28.518
I am so good at naming things.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.399
It's just you and me, womb-mate.

04:36.734 --> 04:37.902
Yep.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.612
Just me and you.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.948
And nobody else.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.243
Hey, check it out.

04:45.326 --> 04:48.288
I'm bouncing a ball
while eating a sandwich.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.708
Wow.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.876
You really are "special."

04:56.421 --> 04:57.588
Will you both pipe down?

04:57.672 --> 05:01.217
I'm taking pictures to send
to my true love, Marius, in Japan.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.594
But I can't decide on my best side.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.346
They're both so good!

05:08.182 --> 05:09.183
Oh, man!

05:09.726 --> 05:12.020
I bounced my sandwich instead of the ball.

05:15.023 --> 05:15.898
You dummy.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.779
Now you're gonna get it!

05:24.157 --> 05:25.533
How do you work this thing?

05:28.077 --> 05:29.287
[Max inhales sharply]

05:29.370 --> 05:31.581
-[gasps]
-[Jackson] Oh, Max!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.541
Look what you just did!

05:34.208 --> 05:37.170
[squeaks]

05:37.795 --> 05:40.715
The Ancient Mariner
has been in the family for generations.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.634
I heard Grandpa Danny bought it
in a garage sale in 1908.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.346
You broke his hat.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.974
And his nose.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.352
And his ear.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.607
Oh, why did I throw that ball?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.901
I don't throw balls. I don't catch balls.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.737
I don't like balls!

06:04.781 --> 06:06.115
Max, don't freak out.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.700
But I'm the good kid.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.118
I never get in trouble.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.788
Nine years of perfect behavior
right down the drain.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.168
Relax. We can glue him back together,
and your mom will never know.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.505
Really? You're the greatest person
on the planet.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.590
I haven't done anything yet.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.469
Well, you put it out there,
so you'd better deliver.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.647
Isn't this great?

06:38.147 --> 06:39.732
I wanted to start our special day

06:39.816 --> 06:41.776
with things I can't do once I'm pregnant.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.236
Hot tubbin',

06:43.319 --> 06:44.737
wine drinkin',

06:44.821 --> 06:46.072
oyster shootin'.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.159
[slurps noisily]

06:53.162 --> 06:55.164
Where did you get a hot tub so fast?

06:55.873 --> 06:57.875
Don't tell DJ,
but I keep this up in my room

06:57.959 --> 06:59.418
for date night with Fernando.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.840
It's usually filled with Jell-O,
because...

07:03.923 --> 07:05.341
You know what? No, that's...

07:06.050 --> 07:07.343
I'm just gonna stop you there.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.303
Today is just the beginning.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.305
After I'm knocked up with your kid,

07:11.389 --> 07:14.851
we'll have nine months
of non-stop togetherness.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.478
[slurps]

07:21.357 --> 07:24.152
You know, there's no guarantee
that you'll get pregnant.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.404
The odds are less than 50%
this'll work.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.656
Oh, honey. We're getting pregnant.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.618
My oven is pre-heated and easy-bake.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.415
I've got surprises galore in store today,
so buckle up.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.750
No really, buckle up.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.920
I souped up this baby
with super-turbo hydro jets.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.507
Oh! Whoa!

07:51.220 --> 07:53.723
[shouts] See? It's like a massage!

07:54.307 --> 07:55.641
And an enema!

08:13.367 --> 08:14.577
Scram, Cosmo.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.873
I said, scram!
You're gonna get me busted.

08:18.956 --> 08:19.999

08:20.875 --> 08:21.918
Cosmo, squirrel!

08:28.174 --> 08:29.717
It's always open!

08:31.135 --> 08:33.054
OK, gentlemen. Upstairs.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.597
First bedroom on the right.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.516
Uh... What's going on?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.102
Well, I had a horrible craving
for ice cream,

08:40.186 --> 08:41.979
and I was feeling very maternal,

08:42.063 --> 08:44.273
so I took Tommy out for a scoop.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.025
Thank you.

08:46.984 --> 08:51.072
And then I remembered you said
Tommy was ready for his big boy bed,

08:51.155 --> 08:53.950
so I got him a big boy race car bed.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.620
What do you say, Tommy?

08:58.120 --> 08:58.955
Gracias.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.540
Gracias!

[speaks Spanish]

09:06.879 --> 09:08.381
That is so sweet.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.217
Today's my day to relax.
Do you mind putting it together?

09:11.300 --> 09:13.344
Of course not. Let's go, Tommy.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.824
Is it just me,

09:34.907 --> 09:37.118
or there is something different in here?

09:39.370 --> 09:41.789
I have the same feeling.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.333
Oh, well.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.420
Let's go make your bed,
and you can lie in it. Ha-ha!

09:47.503 --> 09:48.379
[Tommy giggles]

Hello, DJ.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.600
Hello, Larry.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.144
Do Max and Taylor
have a play date today?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.104
No, but we could have a play date.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.193
These are for you.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.989
Oh. Chocolates from Walgreens.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.159
Half off.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.413
I saw on Facebook
that you changed your status

10:22.496 --> 10:25.249
from "In A Relationship"
to "It's Complicated."

10:28.336 --> 10:29.629
It is complicated.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.589
If you were with me,

10:31.672 --> 10:33.883
your status could be, "It's Magical."

10:36.802 --> 10:37.803
Well...

10:38.304 --> 10:39.972
This is unexpected!

10:42.224 --> 10:43.809
And uncomfortable.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.438
-Hi, Jackson's mom.
-Oh.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.024
Hi, Mankowski. Jackson's upstairs.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.275
Forget Jackson.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.652
These are for you.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.489
Just like my heart.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.203
Thank you.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.413
More half-off chocolates.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.582
Beat it, kid. She's taken.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.877
Guys, I'm flattered.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.462
And a little creeped out.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.800
But I am very busy enjoying
DJ's Day of Doing Diddly,

11:15.883 --> 11:19.720
so, if you could see yourselves out,
I'd really appreciate it.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.182
Uh, do you need any help doing diddly?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.518
Absolutely not.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.230
I'm not leaving.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.524
-I'm not leaving either.
-Well, I'm leaving.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.281
How's it going?

11:39.365 --> 11:40.366
Did you fix him?

11:40.449 --> 11:41.951
Max! What are you doing up here?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.244
You're on head duty.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.373
I'm taking a break.
I put Tommy on the job.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.213
Looks like Tommy's taking a break too.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.507
I quit!

12:01.637 --> 12:03.931
The kid just quit.
Did you fix the head or not?

12:04.014 --> 12:05.057
Calm down.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.102
I made an exact replica of his nose
and ear out of Play-Doh.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.438
And I made a really cool snowman.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.483
It's time to attach the body parts.

12:17.778 --> 12:18.612

12:20.197 --> 12:21.198
Wipe.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.326
Nose.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.289
Not my nose, huh?

12:29.540 --> 12:30.499
Sorry, Doc.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.044
[Ramona] I'll just touch this up,
then glue the hat back on.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.046
The Mariner will be as good as new, Max.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.090
Oh, I love you, Ramona.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.384
Not to be critical, but...

12:40.468 --> 12:42.178
the nose looks a little narrow.

12:42.261 --> 12:46.265
I was modeling it after the nose that
Alison Silverstein got for her sweet 16.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.144
-Oh. Now I see it.
-Yeah.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.861
How fun was that
soul sister shopping spree?

12:59.737 --> 13:01.113
Come on, get in here.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.495
OMG.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.288
It's like looking in a mirror.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.126
You know, not everyone can pull off
a Kimmy Gibbler signature look.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.712
I'd love to pull this off.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.007
[laughs]

13:20.090 --> 13:22.176
See? I'm really starting to get you.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.429
OK, now, behold.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.349
The spiritual umbilical cord.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.268
Ah. Of course.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.354
Which we will tie around each other,

13:33.437 --> 13:36.232
to symbolize
our deep physical connection

13:36.315 --> 13:37.608
for the next nine months.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.860
I learned it at Burning Man.

13:40.945 --> 13:41.987
You went to Burning Man?

13:42.071 --> 13:43.113
Yeah.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.532
I went to the very first one,

13:44.615 --> 13:46.158
back when he was just Burning Boy.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.037
Sanctify.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.497
Purify!

13:53.040 --> 13:54.083
That better be water.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.584
Of course it is.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.587
You can't find wolf pee
on such short notice.

13:59.797 --> 14:00.631
I'm out of here.

14:00.714 --> 14:01.882
Uh-uh. Not so fast.

14:01.966 --> 14:02.800
No!

14:02.883 --> 14:04.510
Get me out of this thing!

14:06.804 --> 14:09.848
I told you,
this is a spiritual umbilical cord.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.518
It cannot be cut
until our relationship is born anew.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.063
I'm just telling you what it said
on the box.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.357
OK. Let's just get this over with.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.860
First, we each select our spirit animal.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.822
Close your eyes, and visualize.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.992
For me, I see a magnificent peacock,

14:28.075 --> 14:31.245
strutting through a beautiful field
of wildflowers.

14:32.955 --> 14:33.998
[screams] Peacock!

14:35.165 --> 14:36.000
Peacock!

14:37.877 --> 14:38.752
Your turn.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.297
OK. Uh...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.092
I see a gazelle,

14:45.175 --> 14:47.219
leaping through the African savanna.

14:48.846 --> 14:49.680
Gazelle.

14:50.848 --> 14:51.765
Gazelle.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.143
Now you're gettin' it.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.728
Next...

14:58.480 --> 15:00.900
Let's share our favorite memories
of each other.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.611
Mine is when you were little,
and someone made you mad,

15:03.694 --> 15:05.529
and you'd say, "How crude!"

15:07.031 --> 15:08.949
I think it was, "How rude!"

15:09.700 --> 15:11.535
What's your favorite memory of me?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.787
Oh! When you went away to college.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.377
How crude!

15:23.297 --> 15:25.591
Now, let's share our deepest fears.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.718
OK.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.012
Well, my deepest fear

15:30.095 --> 15:33.641
is that we're gonna go through
this whole in vitro process

15:33.724 --> 15:35.142
and it's not gonna work,

15:35.225 --> 15:37.353
and I'll never get to be a mom.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.397
Whoa.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.982
That's deep.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.277
My greatest fear is turtles.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.785
Turtles with hats!

15:52.868 --> 15:54.620
Because how do they put them on?

15:56.205 --> 15:57.539
[sighs]

16:00.042 --> 16:01.043
[screams]

16:02.544 --> 16:05.631
What in Sam's Club
are you two doing in here?

16:06.298 --> 16:07.132
Hey, Deej.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.301
Why are you in a hot tub
with two guys?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.306
One seemingly very young.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.977
I had nothing to do with this.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.437
I put cucumbers on my eyes
for one second,

16:20.521 --> 16:21.563
and there they were.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.024
Don't tell me this is the guy
"It's Complicated" with?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.317
Yeah, that's right.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.653
We've been complicated for 25 years.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.197
We dated in high school,

16:30.781 --> 16:32.116
broke up for no reason,

16:32.199 --> 16:34.451
got back together at prom, drifted apart,

16:34.535 --> 16:35.786
married other people,

16:35.869 --> 16:36.829
reconnected,

16:36.912 --> 16:37.871
then I dated Matt,

16:37.955 --> 16:41.041
then Steve got engaged to CJ,
then we all broke up in Japan.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.712
Wow. That is complicated.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.509
[sighs] But not for long.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.470
Deej, these 12 roses are to remind you

16:53.554 --> 16:55.931
that we only have 12 days to go
until our big date.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.017
Oh!

16:58.100 --> 17:00.060
Steve, that is so sweet.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.478
Boring!

17:04.481 --> 17:06.608
Uh, Larry,

17:06.692 --> 17:08.569
it's never gonna happen between us,

17:08.652 --> 17:10.320
so, I'm sorry,

17:10.404 --> 17:12.823
but could you leave, please?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.494
Can we still be friends on Facebook?

17:18.829 --> 17:20.330
We're not Facebook friends.

17:20.706 --> 17:24.126
Yes, we are. I'm actually Carla,
your friend from summer camp.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.425
Jackson's mom, I'll never quit you.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.968
[cell phone vibrates]

17:33.052 --> 17:34.303
But I'd better get home.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.388
My mom just sent out an Amber Alert.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.519
I'm sorry you had to see that.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.064
I'm even sorrier that I had to see that.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.358
But thank you for the roses.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.697
Wow.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.533
You guys didn't waste any time.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.328
Oh. No! This isn't what it looks like.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.329
Oh.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.290
Well, it looks like chocolate, roses

18:03.373 --> 18:05.542
and a cheap, inflatable hot tub.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.462
No, no, the 12 roses signify

18:08.545 --> 18:11.507
the 12 more days we're waiting
to go on a date out of respect for you.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.674
[DJ] Yeah.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.178
I was in the tub with Taylor's dad
and Jackson's friend from school.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.140
Oh... That doesn't sound right, either.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.852
I came to talk to DJ about work,
but Steve, since you're here...

18:23.936 --> 18:24.978
Matt.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.357
I am so sorry about what happened.
I didn't mean to break you guys up.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.608
I know, man.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.986
And look,
if DJ would rather be with you

18:33.070 --> 18:36.532
than a six-foot-two,
steel-ab'd slice of beefcake

18:36.615 --> 18:38.242
with 8% body fat,

18:38.325 --> 18:39.535
that's her choice.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.788
Yeah, it is.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.581
It is, right?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.044
Come on, guys. Can't you work this out?

18:49.545 --> 18:52.923
I really do miss our friendship, buddy.
Is there any way you can forgive me?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.426
Look, man, life is short.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.387
I'm not gonna hold a grudge.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.139
So, we're good.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.974
Yes! Thanks, Matt.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.185
Whoa, you really are lean.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.357
It's like hugging that statue of David.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.819
Aw, this is great!

19:13.902 --> 19:16.989
You are friends again.
Matt, you're coming back to work, right?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.366
Uh... [clears throat]

19:19.449 --> 19:21.785
That's what I came to talk to you about.

19:22.619 --> 19:25.747
DJ, I'm sorry, but I don't think
that I can work with you.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.709
Does this mean you and your abs
are gonna move back to Florida?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.336
Nope.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.297
I'm opening up my own pet clinic,

19:33.380 --> 19:35.340
two blocks from DJ's.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.427
I'm sorry, what?

19:39.178 --> 19:42.347
Harmon Better Pet Care.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.559
That sounds a lot like
Harmon-Fuller Pet Care.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.186
Except it's better.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.523
Well, hey, if you need help moving,

19:51.607 --> 19:54.443
or hanging banners,
sign-spinning, I'm your guy.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.652
Thanks, Steve.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.571
What? We're friends again.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.751
Once I glue the head,
it'll be like this never happened.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.045
Then I'll still be the perfect child,

20:13.128 --> 20:15.422
and all will be right in the world
once again.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.384
[DJ shouts] Guys, where are you?

20:20.427 --> 20:22.429
I'll just glue the head back on later.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.556
Act nonchalant.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.474
OK.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.939
What are you doing?

20:32.522 --> 20:34.358
I don't know what nonchalant means.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.319
So you did the robot?

20:38.737 --> 20:40.072
I panicked.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.994
Hey, guys. What's going on?

20:46.453 --> 20:48.747
Just being all nonchalant.

20:51.875 --> 20:52.834
Hold on.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.670
Something's not right.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.964
I've felt it all day.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.216
No, it's not here.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.217
It's there!

21:05.889 --> 21:08.350
What happened
to our beloved Ancient Mariner?

21:10.852 --> 21:12.896
Yeah, what did happen?

21:14.856 --> 21:17.109
Max, she's giving you the mom stare.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.154
Look away.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.327
I can't.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.954
She's got me locked in.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.082
[Jackson] Stay strong.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.042
It burns!

21:36.920 --> 21:38.797
OK! I did it.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.092
I threw a ball in the house,
and I knocked his head off.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.261
No, Max. Don't take the blame for me.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.638
-I broke the Ancient Mariner.
-No, Jackson.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.349
Don't take the blame for Max.
DJ broke the Ancient Mariner.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.108
Whoa, that does burn.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.486
OK, I broke it!

22:01.570 --> 22:03.488
And I had nothing to do with it.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.825
OK, everybody relax.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.368
The truth is,

22:08.910 --> 22:10.912
this thing is totally creepy.

22:12.372 --> 22:15.542
The only reason it's here
is because Grandpa Danny is a hoarder.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.962
I'm still your favorite?

22:19.046 --> 22:21.465
Max, you know
that I don't have a favorite.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.884
I know you have to say that.

22:25.927 --> 22:29.222
But we both know it's not true.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.935
Oh! Yeah, don't do that.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.063
I've had enough boys winking at me today.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.696
DJ, come see.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.531
Tommy loves his new bed.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.408
He's jumping for joy.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.827
It's adorable.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.915
And now, young Tommy is ready

22:54.998 --> 22:56.666
for his first night

22:56.750 --> 23:00.003
in his big boy race car bed.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.007
On your mark, get set...

23:04.466 --> 23:05.300
sleep!

23:08.095 --> 23:10.013
Oh, you've got the touch.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.349
If there's one thing I'm good at,

23:12.432 --> 23:13.975
it's putting people to sleep.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.773
Now, you may remember this next one
from the playground.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.024
Put up your hands.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.943
To strangle you?

23:24.361 --> 23:26.154
To prove we can work as a team.

I was this close to ditching you
about ten times today.

24:10.907 --> 24:11.741
Why?

24:11.825 --> 24:15.579
Because I tied us together with a rope
and kept you in my room for eight hours?

24:16.872 --> 24:18.248
That was a factor.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.543

you wanted me to be your surrogate.
