WEBVTT

00:08.175 --> 00:10.427
[Grace] The War of 1812 was
a conflict between...

00:11.136 --> 00:13.846
[Jonah] Uh, the US and the UK.
[Grace] Over?

00:13.930 --> 00:16.266
[Tiny] Trade restrictions.
[Grace] Fought in?

00:16.349 --> 00:19.144
-Uh, three separate theaters.
-And the result was a...

00:20.978 --> 00:22.564
-Uh...
-I know you know this.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.023
Um...

00:26.859 --> 00:28.445
Uh, stalemate?

00:28.528 --> 00:30.905
[chuckles] Yes!
You're totally gonna pass this exam.

00:30.988 --> 00:32.824
I need a 75 to graduate.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.912
[imitates Grace] "You'll totally get a 75
on this exam, Zig."

00:37.995 --> 00:40.207
-How did you even get so far behind?
-[coughs] Esme.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.041
-Oh yeah, well...
-Dude.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.918
Have you guys even talked
since the breakup?

00:44.836 --> 00:46.588
She's keeping a low profile.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.216
-[scoffs] Good riddance.
-Can we just get back to studying?

00:49.299 --> 00:50.550
-I'm beat.
-Uh-huh.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.885
-Can I get a lift?
-[Grace] Yeah. What about you, Zigmund?

00:52.969 --> 00:54.554
No, you can't go. The exam's tomorrow.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.014
Yeah, so is prom. Gotta be well-rested.

00:57.099 --> 01:00.102
Yeah. We're not cramming anything else
into our brains tonight.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.520
Says you. You can stay if you want.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.524
Really? Just... just you and me?
Are you sure?

01:06.608 --> 01:10.362
-Yeah, are you sure? [laughs]
-Yeah, I think we can control ourselves.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.030
Where do you wanna start?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.492
[sighs] Um...

01:34.636 --> 01:37.472
[Maya sighs] Oh.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.098
[both chuckle]

01:39.182 --> 01:40.600
Hey.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.810
[Zig grunts]

01:44.646 --> 01:46.273
Uh, sorry for, um...

01:47.774 --> 01:48.775
this.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.485
Well, it's old habits, I guess. [chuckles]

01:50.568 --> 01:53.988
Yeah, I should probably change my clothes
before the exam.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.284
But, anyway, thanks for... for everything.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.204
-[stammers] The studying, I mean...
-[laughs]

02:01.996 --> 02:04.832
-Okay. See ya.
-Bye.

02:11.423 --> 02:14.551
What? [sighs]

02:15.218 --> 02:19.806
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

02:21.599 --> 02:26.396
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

02:30.358 --> 02:35.530
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

02:35.613 --> 02:37.199
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

02:38.283 --> 02:41.994

02:45.081 --> 02:47.167
[Zoë over PA] Now we've reached
our happily ever after.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.836
To celebrate, pick up your prom tickets
in student council.

02:50.878 --> 02:54.216
If Siri knows the capital of Finland,
then why do we have to memorize it?

02:54.299 --> 02:56.468
They need to make something up
to keep us here for four years.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.512
Well, if I survive this exam,
we're definitely celebrating tonight.

03:00.096 --> 03:04.100
-We're volunteering at prom.
-Not my first choice, but sign me up.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.644
-Um, I'm not sure they'd be cool with it.
-Who's they?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.980
[sighs] Yael.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.815
[speaking indistinctly]

03:11.441 --> 03:14.193
-So she's changed her name?
-She changed her pronoun.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.488
Yael's using "they" and "them,"
instead of "she" and "her."

03:16.571 --> 03:19.991
-That's ridiculous.
-[scoffs] And that's why you're not going.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.411
"They" is plural.
Yael's not two people. Right, Baaz?

03:24.746 --> 03:30.377
She... I mean, they seem happy,
so does it matter what we call... them?

03:30.460 --> 03:33.045
Okay. So I'm the bad guy
for breaking up with her, then?

03:33.129 --> 03:34.839
-Them.
-She is the--

03:34.922 --> 03:37.592
-They.
-Is the one who changed.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.302
[sighs]

03:39.386 --> 03:41.346
Why can't we just go back to hanging out
like we used to

03:41.429 --> 03:44.932
before me and Yael were together?
I mean, I barely see you guys anymore.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.228
Yael's friends need to support Yael
because Yael's boyfriend didn't.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.272
Was I supposed to pretend
everything was the same?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.399
Yael's still the same person
on the inside.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.860
And if you loved that person before,
why can't you love them now?

04:01.658 --> 04:06.871
Okay. Uh, volunteers arrive at 5:00,
and then dinner starts at 6:00.

04:06.954 --> 04:10.124
Hey! For the last time, no peeking!

04:10.207 --> 04:13.002
Just tell me!
Will Rasha and I win prom queen?

04:13.085 --> 04:15.463
You'll find out later tonight
with the rest of us.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.214
Just be grateful you have a date.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.676
-Me and Miles are flying solo.
-[Miles] Oh, I'm not going.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.555
-You're skipping prom?
-[Zoë] But what about Tristan?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.139
He broke up with me, remember?

04:25.222 --> 04:28.100
Oh, yeah, so you can go
to your fancy writing school.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.979
Yeah, which I can't afford
because my dad thinks writing is a phase.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.773
And because you haven't asked him yet.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.776
Once people make up their minds,
you can't change them. Right, Zo?

04:36.859 --> 04:40.237
I'm still hoping my mom will change
her mind about me before graduation.

04:41.072 --> 04:44.576
If you want your dreams to come true,
you have to work for them.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.619
So you, you talk to your dad.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.913
And you gotta figure stuff out
with your mom.

04:48.996 --> 04:50.707
And we'll all live happily ever after.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.791
[chuckles]

04:51.874 --> 04:53.710
Well, it's tonight's theme.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.338
And the only way
Goldi will ever forgive me.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.148
-[Zig sighs]
-Pencils down.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.075
[laughs] Whoo!

05:27.118 --> 05:29.371
-I think I messed up, man.
-That's what summer school's for.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.500
No, not with the exam. With Maya.
Something happened after everyone left.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.628
-You had sex?
-No. We... cuddled.

05:37.294 --> 05:41.048
You mean arm all the way around?
Did you use protection?

05:41.132 --> 05:44.844
-[chuckles] What's the big deal?
-She's had such a tough year and...

05:44.927 --> 05:47.680
[stammers] I just broke up with Esme.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.141
[sighs] If I do nothing,
we end as friends.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.394
Hey.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.271
-How'd the exam go?
-Uh, fingers crossed. You?

05:55.354 --> 05:58.483
Same. So, do you maybe wanna go
to prom together?

05:58.566 --> 06:00.402
-Sure.
-[sighs] Okay.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.200
-What now?
-A corsage is always nice.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.453
[Tiny chuckles]

06:11.496 --> 06:13.998
[sighs] You are so lucky
you're going to prom.

06:14.081 --> 06:17.251
-Tiny's gonna love you in this dress.
-[Shay] It shows every curve.

06:17.334 --> 06:18.711
[Frankie] Which is exactly why
he'll love it.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.672
What do you think, Hunter?

06:22.632 --> 06:25.968
-I'll keep my opinion to myself.
-That's it. I'm gonna go change.

06:27.344 --> 06:28.680
Seriously?

06:28.763 --> 06:31.599
I thought boys weren't allowed
to have opinions on the way girls looked.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.767
You're still freaking about Yael?

06:32.850 --> 06:36.228
Baaz and Vijay think I'm a bad guy
for breaking up with her... them.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.356
And so do you.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.777
What if Jonah were to grow boobs
and cut off his penis?

06:42.860 --> 06:45.279
Then I'd have nothing to fantasize about.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.240
But Yael hasn't done anything so drastic.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.619
She... They is still a girl, biologically.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.539
So would it really be that different
if you guys hung out?

06:54.622 --> 06:55.790
Or made out?

06:56.373 --> 06:57.834
-I don't know.
-Well, you better find out

06:57.917 --> 07:00.294
before she starts making out
with someone else.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.298
[Grace sighs] Literally any other tie.

07:04.381 --> 07:06.300
It... it's a statement piece.
Come on, you love it.

07:06.383 --> 07:07.760
-It's a statement piece.
-[both laugh]

07:07.844 --> 07:11.723
Do we have an extra seat in our limo?
I, um... have a date.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.808
Oh. Who's the lucky girl?

07:13.891 --> 07:15.893
-Hey, guys.
-Oh.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.145
So what time are you picking me up
for prom?

07:18.229 --> 07:19.897
-[sighs] Esme, we broke up.
-Sure, but we never said

07:19.981 --> 07:21.273
we weren't going to prom together.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.776
-We're not going to prom together.
-Why not?

07:25.027 --> 07:26.863
He's going with someone else.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.449
Who?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.576
[scoffs] It's Maya, isn't it? Of course.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.745
-So are you gonna get back together?
-Okay.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.749
-Look, we're just going as friends.
-But you wanna get back together?

07:37.832 --> 07:40.793
-That's not what this is about.
-Of course that's what this is about!

07:40.877 --> 07:42.712
It's prom!

07:42.795 --> 07:45.422
How could you do this to me?
We were together for a year!

07:46.966 --> 07:48.384
Things just got...

07:49.469 --> 07:52.138
-a little intense.
-But you still love me?

07:54.348 --> 07:55.642
[both mouthing] No.

07:57.393 --> 08:01.773
Well, you can't just turn that off, right?
Uh, but I need some space.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.193
-You said I could count on you.
-You can.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.572
If you ever need anything, I'm here.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.160
[softly] Okay.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.625
[sighs]

08:24.003 --> 08:25.713
I think that went well.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.098
[Mr. Hollingsworth]
Where's the tux, Miles?

08:36.182 --> 08:38.309
-Isn't tonight prom?
-I'm not going.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.477
Tristan... He broke up with me.

08:42.229 --> 08:46.400
He didn't want me to give up
that writing program in London for him.

08:46.483 --> 08:47.652
Oh.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.446
You got in, huh?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.406
Yeah. Yeah.

08:53.950 --> 08:57.078
[sighs] I know that
you don't support it, but...

08:57.161 --> 09:01.833
I was hoping that you could support me...
at least for a while.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.424
You're cashing in your tickets to Europe?

09:10.507 --> 09:12.343
That's $5,000.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.429
Working as a lifeguard will
give me another five.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.766
Leaving a $10,000 deficit.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.353
Which I need to borrow,
and I've attached a payback schedule.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.897
That covers the first year. Then what?

09:24.981 --> 09:28.150
I work hard.
I... I qualify for financial aid.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.611
[sighs]

09:29.694 --> 09:32.947
Some people think that I can make
a difference with my writing.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.032
I'd like to try.

09:39.453 --> 09:43.124
[sighs] You always choose
the hard path, huh?

09:47.336 --> 09:49.088
You know you have a trust.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.509
That I can't access until I'm 25.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.680
We could change that.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.019
Seriously?

10:06.939 --> 10:10.610
You've grown up so much
over the last two years, you know.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.571
Overcoming addiction...

10:15.531 --> 10:17.324
and being there for Tristan.

10:18.325 --> 10:19.619
The play.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.873
I'm proud of you.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.506
-You've never said that before.
-[sighs]

10:36.761 --> 10:40.181
Go to your writing school.
But there is one condition.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.559
-Don't miss the prom.
-[chuckles]

10:43.643 --> 10:47.229
You know, I skipped mine and...
I've always regretted it.

10:51.358 --> 10:54.445
Jon Snow and Daenerys cannot be endgame.
She's his aunt!

10:54.528 --> 10:57.824
Okay, but Sansa's his cousin.
That's not right, either.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.991
[Hunter] Hey.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.494
What are you doing here?

11:02.578 --> 11:05.539
-We told him not to come.
-I'll leave if they wants.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.334
No, you can stay.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.548
Um, I'm gonna go find out what's going on.
We've been waiting here long enough.

11:14.631 --> 11:16.217
I'll grab you a uniform, too.

11:19.804 --> 11:24.058
-Welcome to the club. [chuckles]
-Oh, I'm not gay. I like girls.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.559
Oh, Yael's not a girl anymore.

11:25.642 --> 11:27.770
-She's not a guy, either.
-[Baaz] So what does that make you?

11:27.854 --> 11:30.064
-Bi?
-Poly, I think.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.523
[Lola] Is that like pan?

11:31.607 --> 11:34.944
-I'm always confused about that one.
-I don't think we have that in Syria.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.321
Okay, could we just stop talking
about stupid labels

11:37.404 --> 11:38.740
and just try and have a normal night?

11:40.157 --> 11:43.285
Um, they said just wait here.
I don't know, everyone kinda seems tense.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.955
I guess student council hasn't figured out
our assignments yet.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.832
Typical government disorganization.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.458
[police siren wailing]

11:49.541 --> 11:51.668
Um, what's going on?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.219
This is definitely not normal.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.689
-Oh, you look so handsome, Zig.
-Uh, thanks.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.691
[Maya] Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm coming.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.659
[camera shutter clicking]

12:24.869 --> 12:26.495
Aw, I'm gonna cry.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.248
[both chuckle]

12:29.331 --> 12:32.877
Oh, my phone is dead.
Okay, I'm gonna grab my charger.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.921
Orchids. My favorite.

12:36.588 --> 12:37.589
Let's...

12:40.134 --> 12:41.510
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[chuckles]

12:43.345 --> 12:46.057
Oh, uh, do you mind not posting that?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.726
Esme's not really thrilled
we're going together.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.938
Okay. Is this, like,
crazy that we're doing this?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.022
No.

12:54.231 --> 12:58.444
-I always pictured going to prom with you.
-Yeah. Me, too. [chuckles]

12:58.527 --> 13:00.321
Aw, you guys.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.365
[both chuckle]

13:04.075 --> 13:05.326
[camera shutter clicking]

13:05.409 --> 13:06.911
-[Maya chuckles]
-[cell phone vibrates]

13:06.994 --> 13:08.120
Oh.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.457
Is that the limo? Okay. Wrap it up.
Everyone's probably waiting outside.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.293
-No, it's not the limo.
-[sighs]

13:14.376 --> 13:17.839
Prom's on hold.
Apparently there was a bomb threat.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.552
[indistinct chatter]

13:27.306 --> 13:29.266
This is crazy.
Someone wants to blow up prom?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.435
It's probably a prank,
like at the winter dance.

13:31.518 --> 13:32.769
It wasn't a prank in Belgium.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.898
-You think ISIS cares about our prom?
-[Hunter] Doesn't matter.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.649
-They're gonna cancel it. We should go.
-Strongly agree.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.151
The bomb could explode at any moment.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.655
Wait. I... I think I know something.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.658
No, they don't.

13:47.659 --> 13:48.744
You don't.

13:49.536 --> 13:50.662
[sighs]

13:51.330 --> 13:53.958
-Don't do this.
-[sighs]

13:54.041 --> 13:55.042
[Saad] What's going on?

13:57.419 --> 14:00.422
-Okay. Come with me.
-What is happening?

14:03.175 --> 14:05.136
[officer] Hang on, son.
We've got some questions for you.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.013
-[Lola] He didn't do anything.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.056
He didn't do anything! [breathing heavily]

14:14.686 --> 14:16.022
[engine starts]

14:20.609 --> 14:22.694
How are they still investigating?
It's been an hour.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.155
They can't cancel prom.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.532
Can we just forget about it
and go get burgers?

14:26.615 --> 14:28.534
[stammers] We should wait
and see what happens.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.619
But what if the threat's real?
Should we risk it?

14:30.702 --> 14:33.330
Well, we only get one prom.
Besides, who would do something like this?

14:33.414 --> 14:34.957
A crazy ex-girlfriend?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.543
-[Jonah chuckles]
-What about that Syrian guy?

14:37.626 --> 14:39.170
Saad? He's not a terrorist.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.089
He lost his cool with Zig.
Plus, he got pretty upset at that protest.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.925
Oh, okay, so next step, blow up prom?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.928
[Jonah] Well, some volunteers were posting
that the police were questioning him.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.888
It's surprising
what people are capable of.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.723
[Zig sighs]

14:56.562 --> 14:57.563
[scoffs]

14:58.480 --> 15:00.482
-What? I just want to see if she's okay.
-[cell phone chimes]

15:00.566 --> 15:03.610
Oh, yeah, she definitely looks okay
in that pic.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.280
That pic. Oh.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.824
-[scoffs] Wow, that pic...
-Okay. Enough.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.828
Zoë just texted. Prom's back on.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.663
-All right! Let's go pick up my girl.
-Nice. All right.

15:14.746 --> 15:16.332
Okay, cool. Everyone in the limo.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.045
[speaking indistinctly]

15:34.308 --> 15:37.937
-It's like a real-life fairy tale.
-Make sure you check out the magic mirror.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.231
-It predicts your future.
-Oh.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.233
Where will we be in ten years?

15:42.316 --> 15:43.692
-Together, I hope.
-[both laugh]

15:48.572 --> 15:49.823
[sighs]

15:51.700 --> 15:54.286
-You throw a killer bash, Chewy.
-You came!

15:54.954 --> 15:58.165
So Dad said yes to school?
So no backpacking in Europe.

15:58.249 --> 15:59.916
Oh, I'm going to do that, too.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.670
And I've got an extra ticket,
if you'd like to come.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.881
Oh, I... I don't know.
I'm pretty swamped this summer.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.217
-Yes! Definitely.
-[laughs]

16:08.300 --> 16:09.926
Where's Tris? I wanna tell him.

16:10.011 --> 16:13.847
Oh, he's not... He's not coming.
Maybe he had nothing to wear.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.270
So, I guess it's just you and me, bro.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.536
You did all this?

16:35.619 --> 16:37.704
Well, they were your ideas.
I just executed them.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.667
I'm sorry I couldn't be your knight
when you needed one.

16:41.750 --> 16:45.129
Maybe you could be my Prince Charming.
At least until midnight.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.963
[chuckles]

16:47.048 --> 16:48.174
Okay.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.896
[sighs]

17:02.979 --> 17:04.231
Oh, my God.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.943
How do they even do that?

17:09.195 --> 17:10.487
Important text?

17:11.447 --> 17:13.282
-Um...
-It's okay.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.118
-You don't have to tell me.
-Uh, it's uh...

17:16.202 --> 17:18.870
-It's Esme.
-She wants to talk.

17:18.954 --> 17:23.167
Well, I'm... not sure
that's all she wants, but yeah.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.087
[sighs] Well, um...
I mean, if you want to go...

17:26.170 --> 17:28.797
Oh, no, no.
I... I wanna be here with you.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.884
-But you feel guilty.
-I just feel like I owe her something.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.346
I mean, without her,
I never would've gotten over you.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.765
Oh, so you're over me?
Does that mean you're not up for a dance?

17:43.645 --> 17:45.231
I'm always up for a dance with you.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.405
Didn't mean to scare you.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.865
[chuckles]

17:54.948 --> 17:56.783
Doctor said you went out for a swim.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.704
-Shouldn't you be at prom?
-Didn't feel right.

18:00.787 --> 18:03.165
The person I care most about is here.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.502
Now, I know we're broken up...

18:09.380 --> 18:10.672
but...

18:11.923 --> 18:13.550
will you go to prom with me?

18:14.301 --> 18:17.138
[chuckles] I got an extra ticket.
I brought you a tux.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.600
I'm leaving to Europe next week
and then staying for school.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.894
-You're doing the writing program?
-Yeah.

18:23.977 --> 18:28.565
So I'd like to spend
whatever time I have left together.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.941
[chuckles]

18:31.026 --> 18:32.194
I, um...

18:33.237 --> 18:34.696
I can't.

18:36.198 --> 18:41.036
-Okay. I respect that.
-No, it's not 'cause I don't want to.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.830
It's just that I've been having a bad day.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.668
I don't know if I could handle
the sensory overload. [chuckles]

18:52.673 --> 18:55.467
Well, then, we'll have to have prom here.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.760
[both chuckle]

19:02.558 --> 19:05.269
I wouldn't be the person
I am today without you.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.354
Ditto.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.110
How do we say goodbye?

19:15.196 --> 19:16.530
We don't.

19:19.741 --> 19:20.992
We just dance.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.226
[upbeat music playing]

19:47.519 --> 19:50.063
-Who's next?
-There's no line. Let's do it.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.857
We're supposed to be serving.

19:51.940 --> 19:55.068
Oh, it's in between courses.
No one's gonna notice. It'll be fun.

19:55.151 --> 19:57.112
-Uh, tiara?
-I'm good, thanks.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.867
Hi.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.371
[camera clicking]

20:07.038 --> 20:09.791
Okay. One for you
and one for your boyfriend.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.419
-That's not my boyfriend.
-It doesn't matter, Hunter.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.796
-I should've known you were a girl.
-Oh, she's not a girl, either.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.840
-It's really no big deal.
-Then why'd you do it?

20:17.633 --> 20:19.050
-Do what?
-[scoffs] This.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.094
Everything was perfect
until you had to go and mess it up.

20:21.177 --> 20:22.471
This is who I am.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.098
-It's not normal.
-There is no normal!

20:25.181 --> 20:27.351
And I'm not the problem. You are.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.107
[upbeat music playing]

20:48.121 --> 20:49.873
[slow song playing]

21:00.050 --> 21:03.304
Ooh! [giggles]
Hey, your dancing has improved.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.388
Yours hasn't.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.472
Kiss!

21:06.473 --> 21:09.142
[chuckles] Thanks, Grace. Real helpful.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.652
[Esme] You blocked me?

21:19.945 --> 21:23.407
You said you would never leave me,
and then you blocked me.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.493
-Esme, calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down!

21:26.577 --> 21:29.079
Do you think I care about stupid prom?

21:31.707 --> 21:33.041
Zig.

21:33.124 --> 21:36.086
Maybe I should just kill myself!
Make you all happy.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.718
-Esme, stop saying stuff like that.
-[voice breaking] Then talk to me.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.220
Please.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.015
Go, it's okay.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.060
I'll be right back.

21:53.019 --> 21:54.187
[breathing heavily]

22:00.486 --> 22:01.778
Esme!

22:10.412 --> 22:11.663
[panting]

22:12.247 --> 22:13.874
I'm so glad you came.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.418
-Whoa! What are you doing?
-Anything you want.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.588
-No. You said you wanted to talk.
-We've talked enough.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.673
We've always been better
when we weren't talking.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.592
No, I don't want to kiss you!

22:25.051 --> 22:26.762
-Fine, no kissing.
-Whoa.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.723
-I'll make you forget all about Maya.
Stop acting crazy!

22:29.806 --> 22:31.767
I thought that's how
you wanted your girls!

22:31.850 --> 22:34.352
You are so messed up.
How did I stay with you for so long?

22:34.436 --> 22:35.979
You can't leave!

22:36.062 --> 22:37.564
This isn't over!

22:38.815 --> 22:40.275
It is for me.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.404
I hate you! I hate you!

22:43.487 --> 22:45.280
-I hate you! I hate you! I hate...
-[grunting]

22:46.532 --> 22:47.533
[grunting]

22:51.620 --> 22:53.121
[crying] Oh, my God.

22:54.330 --> 22:55.416
[breathing heavily]

22:56.458 --> 22:57.584
Oh, my God.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.884
[sad song playing]
