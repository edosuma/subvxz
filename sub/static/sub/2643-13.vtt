Hey, you guys ready to order?

00:05.359 --> 00:08.192
Since we come in
every Tuesday night at 6:00...

00:08.362 --> 00:11.798
...and order the same exact thing,
and it's now 6:08...

00:11.965 --> 00:14.456
...I believe your question
not only answers itself...

00:14.635 --> 00:18.036
...but also stands alongside
such other nonsensical queries as:

00:18.238 --> 00:19.535
"Who let the dogs out?"

00:19.740 --> 00:22.538
And, uh, "How are they hanging?"

00:23.844 --> 00:27.507
Okay, so the usual with extra spit
on Sheldon's hamburger.

00:28.515 --> 00:31.780
Penny, a moment.
Do you have plans this weekend?

00:31.952 --> 00:34.318
Oh, gee, Amy, sorry,
I'm pretty busy this weekend.

00:34.488 --> 00:36.888
Probably serving food
that was ordered today.

00:38.158 --> 00:40.217
Too bad.
I was hoping you could be my plus one...

00:40.394 --> 00:42.794
...at the Institute
of Interdisciplinary Studies symposium...

00:42.963 --> 00:45.955
...on the impact of scientific research
on societal interactions.

00:47.701 --> 00:48.793
The what?

00:50.170 --> 00:51.831
It's an annual science conference.

00:52.005 --> 00:54.405
- We've all been invited to speak.
- Oh, okay.

00:54.575 --> 00:56.668
Well, you know, like I said,
I have plans.

00:56.844 --> 01:00.507
Shame. Since you're my best friend,
it would be a bonding opportunity.

01:01.882 --> 01:03.247
I'm your best friend?

01:03.417 --> 01:04.974
Don't you read my blog?

01:05.886 --> 01:09.219
Oh, don't feel bad. I never read Leonard's,
and I used to sleep with him.

01:12.860 --> 01:15.988
Know anybody who would appreciate
an all-expense-paid spa weekend...

01:16.163 --> 01:17.528
...at a resort in Big Sur?

01:17.698 --> 01:20.394
No, l... I'm sorry, free what?
Sorry, what...? What?

01:20.567 --> 01:22.535
I think her weekend just opened up.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.664
Wait, wait. Just to be clear,
when you guys say spa...

01:25.839 --> 01:28.865
...does that mean the same thing
as when regular people say it?

01:29.042 --> 01:32.910
Pretty much, except we keep
our shirts on in the sauna.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.743
You know, it is going to be difficult,
but I'm gonna cancel my plans...

01:36.917 --> 01:40.114
...so I can do this for my bestie.
- Please don't touch my breasts.

01:41.455 --> 01:42.888
I wasn't going to.

01:43.056 --> 01:45.581
All right.
I just want to establish boundaries.

01:45.926 --> 01:48.360
This is great.
I haven't had a vacation in ages.

01:48.529 --> 01:51.589
In order to take a vacation,
one first has to work.

01:52.366 --> 01:55.699
For a smart guy, you seem to have
a hard time grasping the concept:

01:55.869 --> 01:59.202
"Don't piss off the people
who handle the things you eat."

02:00.140 --> 02:02.199
That does seem to be a valid principle.

02:02.876 --> 02:06.277
I trust Penny will adhere to the
Official California Restaurant Workers'...

02:06.447 --> 02:08.608
...Solemn Oath of Ethics
and Cleanliness.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.776
I don't believe there's any such thing.

everyone's attention, please.

I know we're all eager
to get on the road to Big Sur...

02:46.687 --> 02:50.714
...so if we focus, we can get through
this orientation in under a half an hour.

I don't think so.

are you and Sheldon...

04:41.501 --> 04:43.366
...gonna be sharing a room?

04:43.804 --> 04:45.101
No, we discussed it.

04:45.305 --> 04:47.500
We didn't wanna jeopardize
our relationship...

04:47.674 --> 04:50.040
...by getting to know each other
too well.

04:50.577 --> 04:53.910
Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more
than over-familiarity...

04:54.081 --> 04:56.709
...with someone's toilet routine.

04:56.883 --> 04:59.215
- I can vouch for that.
- Hey.

- Not you, him.
- Oh, thanks.

05:01.955 --> 05:04.856

Don't worry, Penny. You're my plus one.
You'll bunk with me.

05:11.098 --> 05:15.933
And FYI, travel makes me constipated,

Not necessary. Penny and I

Just pin me down and stroke my hair,
I'll be fine.

- Shh, shh.

12:41.948 --> 12:44.940

would you like to start us off...

17:06.346 --> 17:10.782
...by discussing your assessment
of science's responsibility to society?

17:10.950 --> 17:12.144
Sure.

17:12.318 --> 17:16.117
I think all branches of science
have to move cautiously these days.

17:16.289 --> 17:19.816
It's not just giant nuclear weapons
that can destroy the world.

17:19.992 --> 17:23.791
As a microbiologist, I can tell you
even the tiniest organisms...

17:23.963 --> 17:26.625
...can still tear you a new one.

17:30.002 --> 17:34.200
Interesting. I think what you might need
to know about my colleague...

17:34.374 --> 17:38.708
...is that though she claims her field
of interest is tiny organisms...

17:38.878 --> 17:41.813
...she certainly has spent
her fair share of time...

17:41.981 --> 17:46.543
...around what we can assume
was pretty massive weaponry.

17:49.222 --> 17:53.420
I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep
in mind that the past is the past.

17:53.593 --> 17:56.585
But he should know that I am
the kind of girl who could get...

17:56.763 --> 17:59.254

would you care to join the conversation?

18:17.383 --> 18:19.783
Well, certainly.
I'd like to raise two points.

18:19.986 --> 18:23.752
Number one,
I think they are talking about penises.

18:25.858 --> 18:30.056
And number two, these mimosas
are kicking my little brown ass.

18:32.698 --> 18:36.725
- I'd like to kick your little brown ass.
- What did I do?

18:37.036 --> 18:40.233
Oh, I don't know. Maybe when you walk
into a hotel room...

18:40.406 --> 18:43.204
...and you see a guy getting back
with his girlfriend...

18:43.376 --> 18:47.472
...consider doing something other
than crawling into the adjoining bed.
