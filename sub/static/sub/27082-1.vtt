06:14.892 --> 06:16.683
Well, that's good.

08:49.683 --> 08:52.975
All right, buddy. You are getting a little old for baths

08:52.975 --> 08:53.975
so showers

08:53.975 --> 08:55.350
are now your thing.

08:55.350 --> 08:57.350
Are you gonna stay with me?

what if someone sees me?

Don't worry.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.017
We can fix this.

09:49.017 --> 09:51.975
But it will never be the same again.

09:52.309 --> 09:53.850
Will it?

So, what happened with you and Daddy?

10:03.017 --> 10:04.309
[pouring]

10:04.309 --> 10:09.641
You have to understand that love can get worn out over time

10:09.641 --> 10:10.433
and get torn.

10:10.433 --> 10:13.433
Sometimes things can get patched up for good

10:13.433 --> 10:14.892
and sometimes not.

I'd actually like to talk to you about something first.

I'm getting older.

15:46.808 --> 15:49.058
I have to finish school.

15:49.975 --> 15:52.683
Michael, he knows where you go to school.

15:52.683 --> 15:55.100
Do you really think that's smart?

15:55.100 --> 15:56.600
Trust me.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.100
If I ever see him again

15:59.184 --> 16:00.850
I'll kill him.

16:00.850 --> 16:02.683
It's not just you.

16:04.850 --> 16:06.933
I'm gonna be fine. I just...

Look at this mess.

16:47.892 --> 16:49.892
What did you do?

16:51.391 --> 16:54.433
That can't be my mother's china.

16:54.808 --> 16:56.433
Can it?

16:57.142 --> 16:59.975
No, it couldn't.

OK.

Get out of here.

That's tomorrow night.

I'm gonna have to cancel.

20:18.516 --> 20:19.267
No. That's fine.

We'll uhh, we'll get some plywood, cover it up.

Besides, after tomorrow

20:26.558 --> 20:30.600
you'll be able to afford the renovations for this place.

Hey.

23:58.933 --> 24:01.433
You know, my brother has kids.

You guys like magic?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.808
Oh no.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.142
My thumb's come off.

24:40.350 --> 24:41.933
[slap]

24:42.017 --> 24:43.433
And it's back.

24:43.433 --> 24:46.225
[together] Now do all of them!

24:46.433 --> 24:48.808
Kids, please don't bother Mr Welsh.

24:48.808 --> 24:50.600
Can you go set the table?

24:50.600 --> 24:52.975
-OK.-OK, Mom.

Thank you very much.

27:00.350 --> 27:02.142

You seem nervous.

27:07.017 --> 27:08.641
[soft music]

27:08.641 --> 27:10.850
OK, it's understandable.

27:13.767 --> 27:15.475
Your future

27:16.892 --> 27:19.558
at this company is, uhh...

27:21.767 --> 27:23.142
very bright.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.433
[music continues]

27:26.433 --> 27:28.017
So you can relax.

27:28.017 --> 27:30.142
I'm having my talk with the guys tomorrow

27:30.142 --> 27:32.475
and I feel pretty good about it.

27:32.475 --> 27:34.017
Thank you so much, Mr Welsh.

27:34.017 --> 27:36.225
You have no idea how much that means--

27:36.225 --> 27:38.558
Don't thank me, thank yourself.

27:38.558 --> 27:40.391
Maybe I can afford a better house.

27:40.391 --> 27:42.391
[chuckles]
OK.

27:42.391 --> 27:43.558
How about we drink to that?

27:43.558 --> 27:45.225
Yes. [glasses clink]

28:16.017 --> 28:19.017
Guys, guys, you're exhausting Mr Welsh.

28:19.017 --> 28:19.975
He needs to go home soon.

28:19.975 --> 28:24.516
Uh-oh, my dear, I am never too exhausted...

28:24.600 --> 28:26.142
Hey?

28:27.100 --> 28:27.808
All right.

28:27.808 --> 28:30.975
All right, go and hide. I'll count to ten, OK?

28:32.933 --> 28:34.475
OK.

28:34.892 --> 28:35.808
OK.

Umm.

29:03.350 --> 29:04.641
Ten.

29:04.641 --> 29:06.142
Ready or not

29:06.142 --> 29:08.058
here I come.

29:08.350 --> 29:10.058
I'm coming.

29:10.558 --> 29:13.309
-I'm coming for you. Whoa.
-Oh, careful.

29:13.309 --> 29:15.850
So sorry.[laughs]

Hey.

29:38.725 --> 29:40.391
[creaking]

29:45.225 --> 29:47.225
Uh-oh.

29:47.725 --> 29:52.142
I think I might have found someone.

29:53.433 --> 29:55.058
Gotcha!

29:55.933 --> 29:57.475
Ha!

29:57.892 --> 30:00.892
[ominous sound]

30:00.892 --> 30:02.516

[tap opens] [water running]

31:15.558 --> 31:17.683
[children laughing]

31:23.267 --> 31:25.975
I bet Mom was fired again.

31:26.850 --> 31:29.433
You can throw harder, you know?

31:30.558 --> 31:32.892
Jeez, what, are you a girl?

31:32.892 --> 31:36.933
Even my little brother can throw harder than you.

31:38.975 --> 31:41.808
-Ow! What was that for?
-Sorry.

31:41.808 --> 31:42.683
I'm telling Mikey.

31:42.683 --> 31:45.309

33:35.350 --> 33:37.308
[door creaks, closes]

33:41.267 --> 33:43.308
Mind if I join you?

33:45.267 --> 33:46.850
Sure.

33:46.975 --> 33:49.475
I'm not into cross-words anyway.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.350
Six-pack, huh?

33:53.058 --> 33:54.642
Yeah.

33:55.933 --> 33:57.850
It's just root beer.

33:59.767 --> 34:01.350
Want one?

34:01.725 --> 34:03.308
Sure.

34:04.642 --> 34:07.725
[tender music]

34:07.725 --> 34:09.350
Thanks.

34:15.016 --> 34:17.350
I really wanted to leave.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.100
I feel terrible saying that.

34:24.891 --> 34:26.641
But it's true.

34:28.225 --> 34:29.183
I don't blame you.

34:29.183 --> 34:33.433
You're 25, you should now have a life of your own.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.850
I'm over it.

34:40.266 --> 34:41.975
Listen, I...

34:42.225 --> 34:45.391
I know I don't say this enough, but

34:45.809 --> 34:47.058
thank you

34:47.058 --> 34:49.350
for everything that you do.

34:50.058 --> 34:51.684

34:52.141 --> 34:55.725
I know I haven't been the best mom, and

34:56.558 --> 34:58.933
I'm sorry, I'm trying.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.809
Mom.

35:03.809 --> 35:05.850
You know I'm bitter.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.517
No.

35:08.517 --> 35:10.225
Little bit.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.809
I'm sorry about school.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.891
It's all right.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.725
I've got a back-up plan.

35:20.225 --> 35:22.308
You wanna talk about it?

35:22.767 --> 35:24.308
No.

35:24.891 --> 35:27.642
I'm sorry aboutyour job, though.

35:28.809 --> 35:29.767
It's OK.

37:32.141 --> 37:34.642
Karrie! Karrie, honey.

37:34.642 --> 37:35.725
What's wrong?

37:35.725 --> 37:37.016
What's wrong?

37:37.016 --> 37:37.767
Just relax.

37:37.767 --> 37:40.975
I'll get you a cool washcloth and you'll feel better, OK?

37:40.975 --> 37:42.850
Oh, sweetie, come on.

37:42.850 --> 37:44.725
Oh, honey.

37:47.350 --> 37:49.225
Rude awakening, huh?

37:49.975 --> 37:51.600
You OK?

37:53.725 --> 37:56.016
Sweetie, where are you going?

37:56.809 --> 37:57.891
Honey.

Let me take Froggy.

38:00.850 --> 38:02.475

38:02.933 --> 38:05.517
Karrie, let's go on the bed.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.642
Come on.

38:06.642 --> 38:07.975
Oh, sweetie.

38:07.975 --> 38:09.183
OK.

38:09.183 --> 38:09.767
[grunts]

38:09.767 --> 38:12.642
This is gonna make you feel much better.

38:13.558 --> 38:15.058
OK?

38:15.058 --> 38:16.558
Bad dream.

38:16.558 --> 38:18.850
Yeah, I know, I heard her.

38:18.933 --> 38:20.392
No.

38:20.392 --> 38:22.141
I had one too.

38:22.891 --> 38:24.058
Oh, sweetie.

38:24.058 --> 38:26.141
It was just a bad dream.

38:26.141 --> 38:28.225
Tell me what happened.

38:28.350 --> 38:31.517
No. You won't love me anymore.

38:31.517 --> 38:35.058
That's crazy. Of course I love you.

38:35.725 --> 38:38.475
Let me get Froggy, hold on.

38:38.475 --> 38:42.141
OK, here you go. He'll make you feel better.

38:42.308 --> 38:44.350
Tell me what happened.

38:44.475 --> 38:47.975
I, I dreamed that Derry was burning.

38:47.975 --> 38:49.392
[sudden ominous sound]

38:49.392 --> 38:51.141
He was on fire, burning.

38:51.141 --> 38:52.975
I was dreaming of Karrie

38:52.975 --> 38:55.767
but, I just couldn't...

38:55.975 --> 38:57.850
[indistinct chatter]

38:59.725 --> 39:00.809
What?

39:00.809 --> 39:02.684
Get her to wake up.

39:03.684 --> 39:06.933
That evil, it's my fault.

39:06.933 --> 39:08.642
Sweetheart.

39:09.267 --> 39:10.725
I'm scared, Mikey.

39:10.725 --> 39:13.016
It's just a bad dream, pal.

39:13.016 --> 39:14.558
No.

39:14.891 --> 39:17.225
I'm scared of Karrie.

39:17.642 --> 39:19.725
Why do you say that?

39:20.058 --> 39:21.809
It's her new friends.

39:21.809 --> 39:22.933
I'm scared of her new friends.

39:22.933 --> 39:27.558
Sometimes I hear them talking when no one's around.

39:28.350 --> 39:31.392
I think they live in the basement.

What are you doing down there?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.141
Nothing.

40:37.350 --> 40:39.725
I was looking for something.

40:57.016 --> 40:59.350
[soft creaking]

41:06.225 --> 41:07.933
Karrie. Karrie.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.475
Mmm.

41:21.891 --> 41:25.600

41:34.725 --> 41:36.933
[footsteps continue]

41:46.141 --> 41:47.767
[sighs]

42:04.392 --> 42:07.058
[dramatic beat] Hello, sexy.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.433
nWhat are you doing up this time?

42:09.558 --> 42:11.183
Darren?

42:12.433 --> 42:13.975
I know.

42:13.975 --> 42:15.600
I know.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.767
Home late from work again.

42:19.392 --> 42:21.183
It's what I do.

42:21.392 --> 42:22.100
[slurps]

42:22.100 --> 42:24.183
Work, work, work.

42:27.809 --> 42:29.767
What's wrong, Kathy?

42:30.016 --> 42:32.183
Scared or something?

42:34.433 --> 42:36.308
Are you afraid?

42:38.684 --> 42:41.100
You afraid of me, darling?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.267
Oh.

42:43.933 --> 42:47.642
[slurping]

42:47.933 --> 42:50.684
Sweetheart, all I do is work.

42:50.809 --> 42:52.517
All I do is...

42:52.517 --> 42:53.891
[slurps]

42:53.891 --> 42:56.100
everything for you.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.600
All I ask is a little

43:01.809 --> 43:03.809
a little affection.

43:05.517 --> 43:07.558
And yet you

43:08.809 --> 43:10.267
deny me.

43:10.267 --> 43:13.141
[music continues]

43:13.225 --> 43:16.308
[slurping]

43:17.933 --> 43:20.433
I gotta tell you, it hurts.

43:23.141 --> 43:24.725
My mother

43:25.600 --> 43:26.891
used to say that in god's eyes

43:26.891 --> 43:31.225
a woman who refuses her man is no better than a

43:31.558 --> 43:33.891
sodomized whore

43:35.392 --> 43:38.517
that a married woman should be down on her knees

43:38.517 --> 43:40.225
and thank the Lord

43:40.225 --> 43:43.558
to be of service to her man.

43:44.475 --> 43:46.016
You

43:47.350 --> 43:49.517
you piss me off.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.558
[dramatic sound] [grunting]

43:52.558 --> 43:56.725
I sense we've gotsome unfinished business.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.809
You could never finish.

43:59.809 --> 44:02.267
[dramatic sound] [grunting]

44:25.642 --> 44:27.350
[whistling]

44:39.975 --> 44:41.517
See you guys later.

44:41.517 --> 44:43.100
Mikey.

44:45.517 --> 44:47.933
Buddy, you can'tgo with me this time. OK?

44:47.933 --> 44:50.642
But Mom's going to be asleep for a while.

44:50.642 --> 44:51.725
I don't want to be here at home.

44:51.725 --> 44:55.308
You're not going to be alone. Karrie's right up there.

44:55.642 --> 44:57.225
Mikey.

44:57.475 --> 44:58.141
Please?

44:58.141 --> 45:02.308
Buddy, I promise, another time, it will be just you and me.

45:02.392 --> 45:03.933
OK?

45:05.308 --> 45:06.350
[door opens]

45:06.350 --> 45:07.267
[door closes]

45:07.267 --> 45:11.267
[soft ominous music]

45:23.725 --> 45:26.141
Hey, Karrie.

45:26.642 --> 45:29.642
Do you, want to play?

45:30.141 --> 45:32.475
Are you, mad?

45:34.308 --> 45:36.225
Why are you mad?

45:36.225 --> 45:37.975
You know why.

45:38.100 --> 45:41.850
I'm, I'm sorry,Karrie, but I was scared.

45:43.891 --> 45:46.267
What else is new?

45:51.725 --> 45:53.933
Close the door.

45:54.517 --> 45:57.891
[indistinct whispers]

46:03.016 --> 46:05.392
[whispering continues]

46:10.392 --> 46:11.933
Mom?

46:14.016 --> 46:15.558
Mom?

46:17.308 --> 46:19.058
Are you awake?

46:20.475 --> 46:23.975
I think there's something wrong with Karrie.

46:24.683 --> 46:25.433
[dramatic sound]

46:25.433 --> 46:27.558
-What were you telling Mikey? -What are you talking about?

46:27.558 --> 46:29.225
Mikey and Mom can't know my friends

46:29.225 --> 46:31.725
and you're...you're making fun of me!

46:31.725 --> 46:34.100
[scuffling sounds]

46:34.100 --> 46:35.391
You're not going anywhere!

46:35.391 --> 46:36.850
You've hardly been a family again and

46:36.850 --> 46:39.683
you want to leave. Isn't this house for rent.

46:39.683 --> 46:41.516
This house is gonna bring me back

46:41.516 --> 46:43.516
and I'm not going to leave you.

46:43.516 --> 46:45.641
Not you or your whore mother!

46:45.641 --> 46:46.933
Do you hear me?

46:46.933 --> 46:48.767
-Get her!-Karrie?

46:49.225 --> 46:50.808
Derry?

46:51.850 --> 46:53.309
Guys. What happened?

46:53.309 --> 46:56.267
Derry... [indistinct] and he pushed me out.

46:56.267 --> 46:59.267
-Derry! -I didn't mean it!

46:59.267 --> 47:00.058
It's OK, sweetie.

47:00.058 --> 47:03.433
He'll be fine. We'll get some thread and fix it.

47:03.433 --> 47:08.017
You wouldn't care. You'd throw it away if you wanted to.

47:08.017 --> 47:09.975
That's not true, Karrie.

47:09.975 --> 47:12.309
I'm going to get the sewing kit.

47:12.641 --> 47:15.641
I don't know what I'm gonna do with you.

47:17.641 --> 47:21.808
[door creaks, shuts]
[ominous music]

47:27.683 --> 47:28.641
Derry, in the corner.

47:28.641 --> 47:31.058
I'm sorry, Mom, it was an accident.

47:31.058 --> 47:33.058
I don't care! Go!

47:36.184 --> 47:37.975
Karrie, tell her.

47:37.975 --> 47:39.184
I didn't mean to.

47:39.184 --> 47:40.808
The drawer did it.

47:40.808 --> 47:42.475
Now! Derry.

47:42.475 --> 47:44.600
It wasn't my fault.

47:45.350 --> 47:47.017
Face the wall!

47:47.017 --> 47:50.850
[ominous music]

47:55.725 --> 47:59.725

[erratic breathing]

48:31.058 --> 48:34.767
[ominous whoosh]

48:41.975 --> 48:44.017
Derry, what did I say?

48:44.017 --> 48:45.767
In the corner.

48:47.975 --> 48:49.558
Derry.

48:50.309 --> 48:51.558
Derry, what's wrong?

48:51.558 --> 48:52.683
What happened?

48:52.683 --> 48:54.184
Talk to me. Say something.

48:54.184 --> 48:56.391
It's on the corner.

48:57.975 --> 48:59.558
What?

49:00.100 --> 49:02.058
What are you talking about?

49:02.058 --> 49:03.808
Behind the wall.

49:04.017 --> 49:06.058
There's nobody there.

49:06.433 --> 49:09.808
[erratic breathing]

49:11.767 --> 49:12.975
No.

49:12.975 --> 49:14.100
Don't.

49:14.100 --> 49:14.808
It's OK.

49:14.808 --> 49:18.725
[soft pulsing music]

49:37.767 --> 49:39.309
It's OK, Derry.

49:39.309 --> 49:41.100
Nothing's here.

49:41.767 --> 49:42.892
It was...

49:42.892 --> 49:46.433
That's stupid. Derry'sjust being a scaredy-cat.

49:46.433 --> 49:48.808
-I'm not! -Stop!

49:48.933 --> 49:50.808
I hate it here!

[tender music]

50:27.767 --> 50:29.350
Shit.

50:34.558 --> 50:36.975
Disappointed? [ominous sound]

50:37.600 --> 50:38.892
Hey.

50:38.892 --> 50:40.892
Not going to the party?

50:42.309 --> 50:43.767
No.

50:43.767 --> 50:46.516
Then do you have anything to drink?

50:51.516 --> 50:53.433
I hope this is OK.

50:53.850 --> 50:55.433
Yeah.

50:55.641 --> 50:57.184
It's OK.

50:59.892 --> 51:01.975
This doesn't look so bad.

51:03.975 --> 51:07.808
Yeah, well, dimlighting does wonders for

51:07.892 --> 51:09.767
most ugly things.

51:09.850 --> 51:12.017
So you're into looks.

51:13.600 --> 51:17.100
I mean, personality goes a long way, too.

51:17.309 --> 51:18.892
Right.

51:22.267 --> 51:24.475
So how long have you lived here?

51:24.475 --> 51:27.100
For as long as I can remember.

51:27.433 --> 51:29.142
Your folks?

51:30.558 --> 51:32.100
Just me.

51:33.683 --> 51:35.391
Independent.

51:36.142 --> 51:37.850
I like that.

51:38.433 --> 51:42.267
No, I just haven't found the right relationship yet.

51:45.184 --> 51:47.808
I've felt trapped for so long.

51:49.225 --> 51:51.391
Yeah, I know the feeling.

51:52.933 --> 51:55.309
I've never had anyone.

51:57.850 --> 51:59.433
Which is?

51:59.516 --> 52:01.058
A family.

52:02.309 --> 52:04.100
It must be nice.

52:04.850 --> 52:06.267
To be loved.

52:06.267 --> 52:10.058
[music continues]

52:17.683 --> 52:20.767
[scratching sound]
I'm so sorry.

52:21.225 --> 52:23.350
I do that sometimes.

52:24.892 --> 52:26.433
It's OK.

52:28.309 --> 52:31.267
I forgotsomething in the kitchen.

52:34.017 --> 52:35.641
[sighs]

52:40.225 --> 52:42.516
Did I scare off another one?

52:42.975 --> 52:47.100
Actually, you might be thebest thing in my life right now.

52:47.225 --> 52:49.850
Changed your mindabout this place?

52:50.475 --> 52:51.558
Thinking about it.

52:51.558 --> 52:53.975
You have no idea what this means to me.

What is it?

55:47.641 --> 55:49.391
What's wrong?

55:51.933 --> 55:53.767
Something's there.

56:25.892 --> 56:27.850
Or do you like baseball?

56:28.516 --> 56:29.475
Yeah.

56:29.475 --> 56:30.683
I'm a big baseball fan myself.

56:30.683 --> 56:34.184
Not to say I don't like My Little Pony.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.142

Are you sure?

56:56.309 --> 56:56.933
Olive.

56:56.933 --> 56:58.683
Kids haven't seen their uncle.

56:58.683 --> 56:59.309
Olive.

56:59.309 --> 57:00.683
Uhh, do you want me to call someone?

You look good.

So...

57:53.516 --> 57:55.808
why didn't you bring Daddy?

57:59.516 --> 58:01.100
It's a long story, sweetheart.

58:01.100 --> 58:03.975
Mommy says that we can't see him anymore.

58:03.975 --> 58:06.683
That he doesn't want to see us.

58:07.433 --> 58:09.391
No, no, no. That, that...

58:09.391 --> 58:11.475
that's not true at all. No.

You need to leave.

58:46.641 --> 58:47.892
You need to shut up.

58:47.892 --> 58:50.558
If I wannahear from you, I'll ask.

58:50.933 --> 58:53.892
Show a little respect to your elders.

58:54.309 --> 58:56.892
It's uncle Darrel, right?

58:57.225 --> 58:59.600
We're all family here.

59:00.309 --> 59:01.683
No.

59:01.683 --> 59:02.975
We're not.

59:02.975 --> 59:05.641
Uncle Darrel isn't family?

59:05.641 --> 59:07.391
No, he is not.

59:09.975 --> 59:11.641
Sure I am.

59:12.184 --> 59:12.808
Karrie

59:12.808 --> 59:15.516

59:18.267 --> 59:18.892

59:18.892 --> 59:20.683

59:20.683 --> 59:23.850
Bet you wish you could see your daddy now, don't you?

59:23.850 --> 59:25.600
You miss him?

59:25.975 --> 59:27.516
Hmm.

59:29.350 --> 59:30.975
Yeah, me too.

59:30.975 --> 59:32.933
Why don't you tell them, Kat?

59:32.933 --> 59:36.808
Why don't you tell themwhy they can't see their father?

59:36.808 --> 59:38.100
Or he can't see them?

59:38.100 --> 59:40.100
[scuffling sounds]
Let's go.

59:40.100 --> 59:40.975
[scuffling sounds]

59:40.975 --> 59:43.309
There are a lot of lies being told around here

59:43.309 --> 59:44.391
make no mistake!

59:44.391 --> 59:45.892
You do not want to mess with me.

59:45.892 --> 59:49.142
-Stop it! -Why are you fighting?

59:49.225 --> 59:52.391
Sweetie, sweetie, it's OK. Sweetie, that's OK.

59:52.391 --> 59:53.225
Get off her!

59:53.225 --> 59:56.600
If you ever touch me again

59:56.683 --> 59:58.058
I will kill you.

59:58.058 --> 59:59.600
-Michael.-You understand?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.100
-No, you-- -Piece of shit.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.558
Michael, take the kids.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.683
Get them upstairs, please.

01:00:05.683 --> 01:00:07.808
Why are you mad at uncle Darrel?

01:00:07.808 --> 01:00:09.017

Get out of my house or I will call the police.

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:26.808
You know, a house is like a wild dog.

01:00:26.808 --> 01:00:28.600
You gotta tend to it

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.391
take care of it

01:00:30.558 --> 01:00:32.892
or it will turn on you.

01:00:32.892 --> 01:00:33.850
Get out!

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:36.641
I'll be back for my brother's kids.

01:00:36.641 --> 01:00:39.767
[soft ominous music]

01:00:39.767 --> 01:00:43.558

[ominous music]

01:01:00.933 --> 01:01:02.725
So, did he...

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:03.558
did he hit you?

01:01:03.558 --> 01:01:07.309
No, he didn't hit me,but he assaulted my son.

01:01:09.142 --> 01:01:11.475
Was it someone that you

01:01:12.142 --> 01:01:13.391
know?

01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:14.933
No.

01:01:15.933 --> 01:01:18.683
So you don't know who he was or

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:21.309
how he got in the house.

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:22.850
No idea.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.475
Well...

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.892
on the off-chance he is

01:01:29.892 --> 01:01:31.309
still around

01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:33.017
we'll go ahead and send a squad car by

01:01:33.017 --> 01:01:36.725
every few hours to check on things around here.

01:01:36.725 --> 01:01:37.683
That sound good?

01:01:37.683 --> 01:01:39.641
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:01:41.142 --> 01:01:43.058
[electronic beeps]

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.184
Uhh...

01:01:45.516 --> 01:01:47.558
Try and get some rest.

01:01:47.641 --> 01:01:49.767
Take care of the little ones.

01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:51.516

-Ms. Harper? -Yes?

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.600
We found an abandoned truck that matches your description

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.767
not too far from your home.

01:03:33.767 --> 01:03:36.142
-What is it? -They just found his truck.

01:03:36.142 --> 01:03:37.433
He's still out there.

-Make sure everything is locked.
-OK.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.600
You all need to stay together.

01:03:42.725 --> 01:03:43.433
We are.

01:03:43.433 --> 01:03:44.516

[dramatic music] [mechanical sounds]

01:04:03.975 --> 01:04:05.683
Ask them whatwe do when we're asleep.

01:04:05.683 --> 01:04:07.225
Hey, what do we do when we're asleep?

01:04:07.225 --> 01:04:09.933
Are you gonna be watching us then?

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:11.017
Hello?

01:04:11.017 --> 01:04:11.975
We'll be watching.

01:04:11.975 --> 01:04:14.892
We still havesquad cars doing rounds.

01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:18.516
-Oh, that's it?-We're doing everything we can.

01:04:18.516 --> 01:04:20.309
Ma'am, be safe.

01:04:20.975 --> 01:04:22.516
OK.

01:04:22.975 --> 01:04:24.516
Useless.

01:04:34.808 --> 01:04:36.600

01:04:37.267 --> 01:04:37.892
Guys?

01:04:37.892 --> 01:04:39.767
Do you know where Mom's pills are?

01:04:39.767 --> 01:04:41.184
Who took them?

01:04:41.184 --> 01:04:42.142
Tell me.

01:04:42.142 --> 01:04:43.350
Karrie?

01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:44.475
No, Mommy.

01:04:44.475 --> 01:04:45.100
Derry?

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.225
Do you know where they are?

01:04:47.725 --> 01:04:50.892
You are lying to me, aren't you?

01:04:51.516 --> 01:04:53.058
You are.

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.184
You've got to be kidding me.

01:05:01.267 --> 01:05:03.975
This is where you're hiding them?

01:05:04.933 --> 01:05:08.850
[mechanical sounds]

01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:14.808

You're a big boy. Speak!

01:05:26.975 --> 01:05:30.558
Mom, stop. He didn't take them.

01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:38.058
You done?

01:05:39.267 --> 01:05:41.058

I remember watching you sleep when you were their age.

01:06:55.267 --> 01:06:56.808
You were so cute.

01:06:56.808 --> 01:07:00.225
You'd curl up into a little ball.

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:03.475
Mom, we didn't run away from Darren

01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:05.808
did we?

01:07:07.017 --> 01:07:08.100
What?

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:08.933
Darrel said

01:07:08.933 --> 01:07:12.683
tell them, why their daddy can't see them.

01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:16.058
He isn't alive

01:07:16.142 --> 01:07:17.683

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:24.933
He isn't.

01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:28.017

01:07:31.558 --> 01:07:33.100
Yes.

01:07:36.017 --> 01:07:37.100
Did you kill him?

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.475
Michael, you don't need to know what-

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:49.725
He was a monster.

All this time?

01:07:56.225 --> 01:08:00.017

All I ever wanted was a normal life.

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:12.017
I'm sorry.

Is that you, Michael?

01:10:01.641 --> 01:10:05.100
Son, you do not want to mess with me.

01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:10.683
Now you turn around or you are dead, motherfucker.

01:10:10.808 --> 01:10:12.933
I said, turn around!

01:10:55.516 --> 01:10:57.184
he's dead.

01:10:57.184 --> 01:10:58.267

Where'd you get that?

01:11:01.475 --> 01:11:03.391
It was your father's.

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:07.558
And you've used it before.

01:11:08.641 --> 01:11:10.309
Only once.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:12.267
What about a hotel?

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:13.641
Can't we just leave this place?

01:11:13.641 --> 01:11:17.267
No. We're gonna stay here and make some more cookies.

01:11:17.267 --> 01:11:19.058
