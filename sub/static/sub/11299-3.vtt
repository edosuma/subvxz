00:07.030 --> 00:08.229
Previously on House of Lies...

00:08.230 --> 00:10.099
Clyde just took Jeannie's
office, like that.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.109
- No... It's mine!
- It's mine!

00:11.110 --> 00:12.109
You guys make this shit better.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.119
- We'll make it better.
- See that?

00:13.120 --> 00:14.199
That's why Clyde gets the office.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.178
- Kelsey.
- What, Clyde?

00:16.180 --> 00:18.739
You got a real, functional
heart in there.

00:18.740 --> 00:20.450
- I don't want to share you with anyone.
- What's this?

00:20.451 --> 00:21.832
Your letter of resignation.

00:21.833 --> 00:24.109
I filed a sexual harassment
claim against you.

00:24.110 --> 00:26.019
- Fuck these guys.
- Okay, fuck 'em.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.574
You bought me out on stock options.

00:27.575 --> 00:29.129
You're welcome, Grant.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.019
Oh, fuck.

00:31.020 --> 00:34.009
We pay you to walk the fuck away.

00:34.010 --> 00:36.039
Skip, go fuck yourself.

What are these motherfuckers
waiting on? Yo!

00:55.040 --> 00:56.149
Play...

00:56.150 --> 00:59.019
You know what, fuck it.
I'm just gonna hit.

00:59.020 --> 01:01.039
This shit wouldn't
happen at Augusta, man.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.199
Oh, this definitely isn't Augusta.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.998
'Cause if it was Augusta, we'd
be carrying trays right now.

01:05.000 --> 01:05.999
I wouldn't be carrying no tray.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.049
- Shit.
- Shit.

01:08.309 --> 01:10.468
All right, fuck it, let's
go play Augusta, man.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.199
Well, we just gonna apparate
there like Harry Potter?

01:13.200 --> 01:16.763
No, we gonna jump on my G5. I got a
tee time for 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

01:16.765 --> 01:19.049
We get on my plane, get
there, eat a steak.

01:19.050 --> 01:22.069
And after that, wake up in
the morning, hit that shit.

01:22.070 --> 01:23.159
- Mm.
- Be a lovely, lovely time.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.169
It would be a lovely, lovely time.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.049
But I have a lovely,
lovely job, remember?

01:27.050 --> 01:29.109
Not all of us parachuted out at 38.

01:29.110 --> 01:31.129
I forgot, you're the guy that
flies around the country

01:31.130 --> 01:33.169
- telling people richer than you are...
- Mm.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.159
How to get even richer
while you stay the same.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.069
- That's right. My bad, my bad.
- Yup.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.999
- My... my bad.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.079
That-that's me. For now.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.039
Like this nut bucket you got
in New Mexico. Why don't you

01:42.040 --> 01:43.079
tell him he's on the
"life's too short" list?

01:43.080 --> 01:46.049
Because my man is worth
11 billion racks.

01:46.050 --> 01:48.029
The motherfucker's in space.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.069
I like the motherfuckers
in space, Donald.

01:50.070 --> 01:51.129
That's why you're not in my business.

01:51.130 --> 01:53.069
I need 'em out there. That way, I can

01:53.070 --> 01:55.139
extract the money, you know?
Deplete that bank account.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.009
Sometimes a gig is just a gig, okay?

01:58.010 --> 01:59.585
Can't all be limos and
blow jobs all the time.

02:00.110 --> 02:02.019
Holy shit.

02:02.020 --> 02:03.229
Speaking of blow jobs.

02:03.230 --> 02:05.109
- Marty Kaan!
- Aw, fuck me.

02:05.110 --> 02:06.129
Skip Galweather.

02:06.130 --> 02:07.169
No, fuck me!

02:07.170 --> 02:09.169
Holy shit!

02:09.169 --> 02:12.009
I'm sorry, um, was I holding you up?

02:12.010 --> 02:13.079
- Little bit.
- So-so sorry.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.219
I called the clubhouse;
they said no problem

02:14.220 --> 02:17.129
keeping you guys waiting, so
I can catch up to my guys.

02:17.130 --> 02:20.099
- Yeah, yeah, here we go.
- What the fuck are you doing?

02:20.100 --> 02:23.209
I just got an old shoulder injury.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.059
I got to stretch it out. Here we go.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.079
Yeah, that's good.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.029
Why don't you just drop one down

02:28.030 --> 02:29.139
in the fairway there and say it's one?

02:29.140 --> 02:33.150
Well, I would like to,
but I'm not going to.

02:34.210 --> 02:37.019
Son of a bitch.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.019
Thank you, guys.

02:40.150 --> 02:42.229
Here we go.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.099
Don't want to use one of your balls?

02:44.100 --> 02:46.019
Yeah, thanks for teeing
up for me, Martin.

02:46.020 --> 02:48.070
I appreciate that.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.089
There we go.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.199
280 down the middle of the fairway.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.049
Oh, my God.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.229
I think I recognize your foursome.

02:58.230 --> 03:00.189
- It's the Monopoly guy.
- Mm-hmm.

03:00.190 --> 03:02.049
And that's Colonel Sanders.

03:02.050 --> 03:03.079
The dude on the right, isn't
that... that's Satan.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.169
Yeah, that looks like him.

03:04.170 --> 03:06.069
It makes no difference
who those guys are,

03:06.070 --> 03:08.089
except that they're very important;

03:08.090 --> 03:11.189
important enough to keep you
waiting on the golf course.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.189
Yeah, I wouldn't hit into
Colonel Sanders or Satan.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.049
No, definitely not Satan.

03:15.050 --> 03:16.079
- Hey, Martin?
- Yeah?

03:16.080 --> 03:18.059
You and I should play a
round of golf sometime.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.069
Talk about life.

03:19.070 --> 03:20.159
It's never gonna happen.

03:22.130 --> 03:24.120
See, that's the shit I'm talking about.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.149
You're very odd this morning.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.120
I'm odd every morning.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.179
So, you know my app Fruity Face?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.069
Yeah.

03:43.070 --> 03:44.189
It sold.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.999
Like a real offer?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.089
Actually, we closed yesterday.

03:47.090 --> 03:48.119
Fuck yeah! Way to go.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.129
Seven figures.

03:49.130 --> 03:50.179
What...?

03:50.180 --> 03:52.089
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

03:52.090 --> 03:54.109
Seven figures for Fruit Man, Fruity Man.

03:54.110 --> 03:55.109
Fruity Face.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.079
Fruity Face, Fruity Face.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.179
Wow...

03:58.180 --> 04:00.019
Hey, hey!

04:00.020 --> 04:02.129
Oh, my God, look at you two.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.189
So cute.

04:03.190 --> 04:05.089
- Hi, Doug.
- Hey.

04:05.090 --> 04:07.089
Look, sorry to take up
precious moments here,

04:07.090 --> 04:09.169
but do you mind if I bend
your ear for just a second?

04:09.170 --> 04:10.159
No.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.089
Ha, ha!

04:12.090 --> 04:14.209
Anyway, my Dungeons & Dragons mentee,

04:14.210 --> 04:17.089
now client, Tess
Symington, aka Sabretha,

04:17.089 --> 04:19.159
has asked for a D&D; tutorial.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.119
Tutorial? Really?

04:21.120 --> 04:22.108
See, as her Dungeon Master,

04:22.110 --> 04:23.999
it puts me in a very delicate situation,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.149
because I know in the real world,

04:25.150 --> 04:27.039
she's a powerful businesswoman,
but she's a fragile virgin

04:27.040 --> 04:28.219
in the world we inhabit together.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.069
If I hadn't saved her ass,

04:30.070 --> 04:32.019
she'd have perished in the
Lair of Abrax the Evil.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.169
And that's a level one!

04:34.170 --> 04:36.089
Bye, Doug.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.180
We'll talk later.

04:39.020 --> 04:41.069
Wait, so is she or isn't she

04:41.070 --> 04:44.029
looking for something more?

04:44.030 --> 04:46.180
Clyde? Clyde?

04:47.170 --> 04:49.059
That's right.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.129
All of it, bitch.

04:50.130 --> 04:52.039
You know, this could be difficult,

04:52.040 --> 04:53.219
but you make it so much easier.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.109
Hustle it up!

04:55.110 --> 04:56.229
And don't leave any of
your girly snot and tears

04:56.230 --> 04:58.209
on my furniture, okay?

04:58.210 --> 05:00.019
You know, I actually don't feel safe

05:00.020 --> 05:01.139
being in the same room with you.

05:01.140 --> 05:04.079
Seeing as you're a known
workplace predator.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.029
Would you just show me one sexy
ball on the way out, Clyde?

05:07.030 --> 05:08.179
Aw...

05:08.180 --> 05:10.099
Bless your heart, Clyde.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.229
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

05:11.230 --> 05:13.099
Sweet, sweet Clyde.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.199
I really feel for you, buddy.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.099
You know what, Doug?

05:16.100 --> 05:18.029
Get that patronizing bullshit
out of my fucking face.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.119
I know, I know.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.179
- I get it. Thought you made it..
- No!

05:20.180 --> 05:22.059
Into Marty's most intimate circle.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.069
And here comes Jeannie, and
just like that, you're out.

05:24.070 --> 05:25.119
Booted unceremoniously down the hall,

05:25.120 --> 05:26.139
out of his embrace,

05:26.140 --> 05:27.189
for the old puss-ay.

05:27.190 --> 05:29.109
- Ew.
- Come here, bring it in.

05:29.110 --> 05:30.129
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Yeah, come...

05:30.130 --> 05:31.219
Sincerely, Doug, get
the fuck away from me.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.019
- I know you want this Guggenlove!
- Get off of my...

05:33.020 --> 05:34.149
You leave me the fuck alone. I don't...

05:34.150 --> 05:35.189
- How's this? There it is.
- I don't...

05:35.190 --> 05:36.230
Right?

05:38.050 --> 05:40.009
Guys having a little
sword fight down below?

05:41.090 --> 05:44.009
You see, real men can hold each other.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.029
Marty Kaan, once again

05:45.030 --> 05:47.109
sticking it right in my fucking ass!

05:47.110 --> 05:50.039
You told me that I would have
autonomy within my team!

05:50.040 --> 05:52.189
And you believed me, even
after you tried to kill me.

05:52.190 --> 05:54.209
- Dick.
- Yeah, and somehow

05:54.210 --> 05:56.089
you still cash my checks.

05:56.090 --> 06:00.029
I cash your checks because you
wedged me into a buyout, and now

06:00.030 --> 06:01.109
you're squeezing my balls
on the little bit of turf

06:01.110 --> 06:02.189
- I have left here.
- Hmm.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.089
I'm really thinking of pulling
my people out of here.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.049
Oh, well, that would be
stupid even for you, Grant.

06:06.050 --> 06:07.209
I'm sick of your shit, Marty!

06:07.210 --> 06:10.229
Something tells me that your
people would not follow you.

06:10.230 --> 06:12.069
Oh, you want to see?

06:12.070 --> 06:13.999
- Why don't we see?
- I think it's called a contract.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.039
Fucker!

06:15.040 --> 06:16.159
Hey, Jeannie, welcome
back. And good-bye.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.169
Okay, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

06:18.170 --> 06:21.999
I happen to know that the
two of you have a grudging

06:22.000 --> 06:23.119
fondness for one another.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.079
Huh! Oh, you know, it's not personal.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.179
He's just a fucking asshole.

06:25.180 --> 06:26.219
Okay, I also happen to know

06:26.220 --> 06:29.099
that Marty sees you

06:29.100 --> 06:32.109
as a major leader in the media
division moving forward.

06:32.110 --> 06:33.199
Media?

06:33.200 --> 06:35.029
Hmm.

06:35.030 --> 06:37.219
- Right, Marty?
- Yeah.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.069
I was gonna tell you before you

06:39.070 --> 06:41.009
burst in here acting like an asshole.

06:41.010 --> 06:42.069
Just give me a minute with Marty

06:42.070 --> 06:43.029
and we will pick it up again.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.049
I promise.

06:44.050 --> 06:46.039
All right.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.199
- Douche bag.
- Dickhead.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.019
- Fuck-stick.
- Cum-stain.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.079
"Hey, Grant, how about you

06:51.080 --> 06:52.069
run our media department?"

06:52.070 --> 06:53.159
What the fuck are you doing to me?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.119
You're not a people person, Marty.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.069
Really? You think?

06:57.070 --> 06:59.059
I'm not just talking
about Grant Stevens.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.129
I think you need help.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.089
- No, I do not.
- We're trying

07:02.090 --> 07:04.089
to assimilate eight different
companies here, Marty,

07:04.090 --> 07:06.009
and you insist on going
on the road every week.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.119
What the fu...? I got to land
what I got to land, boo.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.199
I'm not trying to argue.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.019
I just think it would benefit
us to bring in some help.

07:13.020 --> 07:14.089
Now, I know he's a dick,

07:14.090 --> 07:15.159
but you cannot argue that he's good.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.660
He just got out of his contract
with Denna Altschuler.

07:16.661 --> 07:17.159
No.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.999
- And this is what he's great at.
- No, no, no.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.019
- It's exactly what he does.
- Do not say...

07:20.020 --> 07:22.050
Ron Zobel!

07:23.130 --> 07:26.189
I am not bringing that
fuck-nut into this company.

07:26.190 --> 07:29.059
I don't care that he's a
great turnaround artist.

07:29.060 --> 07:32.999
And I don't care that his
loyalties have realigned.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.139
You cannot come in here and just
blow my shit up on day one.

07:36.140 --> 07:38.019
Okay?

07:38.020 --> 07:40.209
So... no.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.119
Flight 930 to Santa Fe.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.169
So the COO is an old
B-school classmate of mine

07:46.170 --> 07:48.189
- and his name is Yurgen Celebi.
- Yurgen.

07:48.190 --> 07:50.149
- And, uh, his boss is Sean Chew, yeah.
- Sean Chew.

07:50.150 --> 07:54.079
Made his first billion at
26 by starting Everyshirt.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.099
Basically built a better mousetrap.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.139
Revolutionized fulfillment though.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.169
But now he's into this whole

07:58.170 --> 08:00.059
Holacracy kick. You know, no hierarchy,

08:00.060 --> 08:01.139
no bosses.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.059
Celebi thinks it's gonna
tank the company.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.089
Probably right. Doug!

08:04.090 --> 08:06.009
- What are you doing?
- Doug?

08:06.010 --> 08:07.219
Wait, no, I'm just, I'm... guys!

08:07.220 --> 08:09.179
- This is a big deal! The K and A super-pod back together.
- Sorry.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.159
- I just, I want to document it.
- Yeah.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.179
Just get a quick one, get a quick one.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.199
Hold on, let me do it.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.039
You can't bump me, 'cause it'll shake.

08:17.110 --> 08:18.179
Hold it straight, Doug!

08:18.180 --> 08:20.029
Hold on a second! No, Jeannie!

08:20.030 --> 08:21.109
- There's mine. You got her.
- Wait...

08:21.110 --> 08:22.229
- Here's a quick one for you.
- No, rude.

08:22.230 --> 08:24.069
Well, fine, you'll thank me

08:24.070 --> 08:25.639
when you get these framed for Christmas.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.169
I'm still not sure I see the
advantages of Holacracy.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.999
You don't see the
advantages of Holacracy?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.169
Okay, whoa, Jesus!

08:35.169 --> 08:37.068
Close.

08:38.110 --> 08:39.188
Sean Chew, humble visionary.

08:39.190 --> 08:41.109
Come inside.

08:41.110 --> 08:44.019
Kaan and Associates, come inside.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.069
Marty.

08:45.070 --> 08:46.129
- Hey!
- What's happening, man?

08:46.130 --> 08:47.109
Good to see you.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.119
All right, good to see you, brother.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.119
Uh, drone's gone?

08:49.120 --> 08:51.069
Yeah, I think it's gone.

08:51.070 --> 08:54.009
Uh, Yurgen Celebi, this is
Jeannie van der Hooven,

08:54.010 --> 08:55.039
Doug Guggenheim, Clyde Oberholt.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.169
This is my top team.

08:56.170 --> 09:00.039
Good, cool, great, awesome
and other superlatives.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.169
Look, I got orders from Sean
to bring you directly to him.

09:03.170 --> 09:06.069
- Okay.
- So just...

09:06.070 --> 09:09.999
Marty, this Holacracy thing,
it's fucking my shit up, okay?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.999
I mean, no bosses, no organization.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.199
Anybody can be in any
meeting any fucking time?

09:14.200 --> 09:16.129
What the fuck kind of shit is that?

09:16.130 --> 09:18.039
This whole thing is going pear-shaped.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.119
Dude is off the
motherfucking reservation.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.159
And get this, I'm employee number two

09:21.160 --> 09:22.179
up in this bitch, right?

09:22.180 --> 09:25.039
But I can't cash out
for another two years.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.059
Now what if...

09:27.060 --> 09:29.079
what if he blows this before then?

09:29.080 --> 09:33.089
Yurgen, we are here, and
we have your back, okay?

09:33.090 --> 09:35.029
Don't worry about it, buddy.

09:35.030 --> 09:38.039
Okay. All right. Thank you, Marty.

09:38.040 --> 09:38.973
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

09:38.974 --> 09:40.069
Oh, of course.

09:40.070 --> 09:42.059
We don't do it for the thanks.

09:48.230 --> 09:50.119
Sean Chew.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.009
I got to tell you, this is a great...

09:52.010 --> 09:54.059
Shh.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.170
What's happening?

09:58.220 --> 10:00.059
Mmm.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.229
I smell your brilliance.

10:01.230 --> 10:04.179
Uh, yeah, well, uh, we
were stuck on that tarmac

10:04.180 --> 10:06.179
- for a while.
- You're tired of it.

10:06.180 --> 10:08.059
Even though you're getting
everything you want,

10:08.060 --> 10:09.009
aren't you, Marty Kaan?

10:09.010 --> 10:11.079
Um... no.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.139
I'm-I'm good. We're just
here to help you, buddy.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.199
- We all are.
- Absolutely.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.149
Your piece in Forbes about
the soul of the customer,

10:18.150 --> 10:20.099
- it changed my life.
- Really, Clyde?

10:20.100 --> 10:21.229
I think I'm the one who
told you about Sean Chew

10:21.230 --> 10:23.049
and his online retail revolution.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.999
- I don't think so, buddy.
- Yeah, pretty sure.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.039
Are you kidding? You girls
can't do this later?

10:26.040 --> 10:27.099
No, it's... I'm just...

10:27.100 --> 10:28.999
- It was in 2012. It's written in my planner.
- Shush.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.189
I'm sure Yurgen wants me to give
up on Holacracy, doesn't he?

10:31.190 --> 10:33.099
Well, I've been pretty
frank about that, Sean.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.219
Do you understand Holacracy?

10:34.220 --> 10:36.159
Do you "grok" Holacracy?

10:36.160 --> 10:38.009
Uh, I understand it.

10:38.010 --> 10:39.139
I'm not sure that I "grok" it.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.089
Marty, if I may.

10:41.090 --> 10:43.009
Sean, I got this.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.169
"Grok" was originally coined
by Robert A. Heinlein

10:45.170 --> 10:48.109
in his seminal 1961 sci-fi novel,

10:48.110 --> 10:50.219
A Stranger in a Strange Land.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.129
It essentially means to take
something in so deeply...

10:52.130 --> 10:53.159
You Doug?

10:53.160 --> 10:55.039
Am I Doug? Yes, sir.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.089
Yes. Oh, my God. Doug Guggenheim.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.129
- Ow!
- Yes!

10:58.130 --> 11:00.129
Doug needs to shut the fuck up

11:00.130 --> 11:02.139
while I mind-meld with Marty.

11:02.140 --> 11:03.179
Hey, Douglas,

11:03.180 --> 11:05.059
do you grok

11:05.060 --> 11:06.109
shutting the fuck up?

11:06.110 --> 11:07.149
Listen, all of you. Marty.

11:07.150 --> 11:09.170
- Pretty blonde. Jewish guy.
- Sure.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.029
Doug.

11:12.030 --> 11:15.109
Holacracy is how we're going
to evolve as a species.

11:15.110 --> 11:18.229
No boundaries, no
hierarchies, no titles.

11:18.230 --> 11:20.159
Uh, for example, you, excuse me, you.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.179
What do you do here?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.139
Oh, hey, I'm Dicky. I'm in fulfillment.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.209
Like, I pack boxes full of shirts.

11:25.210 --> 11:29.109
Dicky, you are here attending a meeting

11:29.110 --> 11:31.119
at the highest level of this company

11:31.120 --> 11:33.089
because you felt that you had
something to contribute.

11:33.090 --> 11:34.219
- Isn't that right?
- Uh, really just...

11:34.220 --> 11:37.079
they allow us to take a
break to attend meetings,

11:37.080 --> 11:39.059
and the AC is way better
in this building.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.179
Ah.

11:40.180 --> 11:43.030
See, Marty, now I know.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.079
Now I know.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.029
Let's make sure the AC in
the fulfillment center

11:48.030 --> 11:49.070
is equal to the AC here.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.179
I see you, Marty Kaan.

11:52.180 --> 11:54.039
You're the ultimate skeptic.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.119
Uh, you got me.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.039
You're the man for whom the bell tolls.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.189
It tolls for thee.

11:58.190 --> 12:01.129
You're here to help me. You're
here to help Everyshirt.

12:01.130 --> 12:02.999
But I'm going to help you.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.099
Yes, by inculcating you into
a very special philosophy.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.199
If I can win you over

12:08.200 --> 12:12.999
to the way of seeing,
being that is Holacracy,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.119
then I know that I am
on the right track.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.149
You know how I'm gonna do that?

12:26.140 --> 12:29.039
Oh, my God, they're Satanists.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.009
Shit, I forgot my Satanist outfit.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.169
Shh.

12:33.170 --> 12:38.049
Greetings, my friends, my
new friends and associates.

12:38.050 --> 12:41.219
Today we participate
in a sacred ceremony,

12:41.220 --> 12:44.019
one that has been practiced
for thousands of years.

12:44.020 --> 12:46.009
- Yep, told you.
- The practice

12:46.010 --> 12:49.219
of partaking of the remarkable
teaching properties

12:49.220 --> 12:51.129
of the ayahuasca.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.089
Yagé.

12:53.090 --> 12:55.209
Shori, natem.

12:55.210 --> 12:57.209
Call it what you like,
it will still take you

12:57.210 --> 13:00.169
exactly where you need to go,

13:00.170 --> 13:03.090
let you see what you need to see.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.059
This is Majo...

13:06.060 --> 13:07.059
Hey, Majo.

13:07.060 --> 13:08.069
That's Majo?

13:08.070 --> 13:09.109
...our shaman.

13:09.110 --> 13:11.049
She will be your guide

13:11.050 --> 13:12.139
on this transformational path.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.999
I welcome you all to the spirit realm.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.179
Is there a bathroom?

13:28.170 --> 13:31.069
It's good. Uh, just, does
it have gluten in it?

13:31.070 --> 13:33.009
I just... because I've
got some dietary...

13:33.010 --> 13:34.019
Sure, yeah.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.040
What does it taste like?

13:37.100 --> 13:38.219
No, I'm good. I'm gonna pass.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.190
I'm good. I...

13:44.040 --> 13:46.029
Uh, I'll have a little.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.220
Just, like, a half.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.030
Ugh, ugh.

14:56.130 --> 14:58.160
Oh, yeah, nothing.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.119
Kelsey.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.219
Kelsey.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.119
I'm gonna give you a sacred orgasm.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.179
I'm sorry.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.119
When you get back, I'm gonna make

15:08.120 --> 15:09.149
some very sweet love to you.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.089
Sweet love!

15:17.080 --> 15:19.109
All right, fuck the dumb shit!

15:21.110 --> 15:22.229
News flash.

15:22.230 --> 15:25.159
I don't feel a fucking thing.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.169
Shaman says close my eyes and
watch the movie of my spirit.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.099
Know what happens when I close my eyes?

15:31.100 --> 15:32.139
I see a to-do list.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.069
I see my company.

15:35.070 --> 15:38.079
I see the people I'm responsible to.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.999
I mean, is that the movie of my spirit?

15:41.000 --> 15:44.029
The fucking to-do list?

15:44.030 --> 15:47.089
This guy's not thinking
about his to-do list.

15:47.090 --> 15:49.079
Yeah, these two right here?

15:49.080 --> 15:52.079
Definitely not thinking about the job.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.029
Oh, wait, now this crazy motherfucker,

15:56.030 --> 15:58.169
yeah, he's probably
thinking about the job,

15:58.170 --> 16:01.179
but not in the same way that
I'm thinking about the job.

16:01.180 --> 16:04.149
All right, I got to close
this motherfucker.

16:04.150 --> 16:07.019
So let's do this shit.

16:22.070 --> 16:24.019
Gnome.

16:24.020 --> 16:28.029
And... and blue goblin.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.039
And...

16:30.040 --> 16:34.199
Smelly Jesus, tell me,
tell me, tell me now.

16:34.200 --> 16:38.059
Does Tess-slash-Sabretha

16:38.060 --> 16:42.069
really want a D&D; tutorial?

16:42.070 --> 16:45.040
Or does she want a lover?

16:51.150 --> 16:53.999
Oh, Majo.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.099
Majo.

16:56.190 --> 16:57.229
That's your name, right?

16:57.230 --> 16:59.139
Doesn't matter anymore.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.149
Let it go.

17:01.140 --> 17:03.230
Let him go.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.229
Oh, Majo.

17:07.230 --> 17:11.009
Your breath is really
fucking with my high.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.009
Kelsey, hey.

17:12.010 --> 17:14.029
Hey, you okay?

17:14.030 --> 17:16.108
I'm very altered right
now, but I'm good.

17:16.109 --> 17:19.029
I just wanted to connect with
you to say that I miss you.

17:19.030 --> 17:20.999
Hey, Clyde, there's no
great way to do this,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.079
but I really feel the longer we
put it off, the worse it'll be.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.999
No fucking way.

17:25.000 --> 17:25.999
Well, it just...

17:26.000 --> 17:27.079
You're breaking up with me?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.138
Clyde, can you please...?

17:28.140 --> 17:30.059
Right now, over the fucking phone,

17:30.060 --> 17:31.069
No, I just... Can we...?

17:31.070 --> 17:32.119
While I'm tripping on ayahuasca,

17:32.120 --> 17:34.159
and you're probably sitting
there writing code?

17:36.220 --> 17:39.049
Come on, you know things
have been weird lately.

17:39.050 --> 17:40.209
No, you're probably... you're
probably right though.

17:40.210 --> 17:42.139
That's probably a good move, Kels.

17:42.140 --> 17:45.079
You just got so weird about
the Fruity Face thing, and...

17:45.080 --> 17:46.089
No, no, no, I totally get it.

17:46.090 --> 17:47.099
Yeah, break it off.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.109
Uh-huh.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.060
Fuck!

17:50.200 --> 17:52.099
Have we been here a long time?

17:52.100 --> 17:55.160
Have we been here a long time?

17:59.180 --> 18:02.120
Marty. Marty.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.230
Marty.

18:11.435 --> 18:15.149
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

18:15.150 --> 18:17.009
I... I see God.

18:17.010 --> 18:19.039
Yeah.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.029
Marty.

18:21.030 --> 18:24.129
Do you think that we will ever...?

18:24.130 --> 18:28.009
Do... do you think that our daughter...

18:28.010 --> 18:28.434
- Jeannie, Jeannie.
- Will ever...

18:28.435 --> 18:30.039
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.219
- See us...
- Boo, boo, boo, listen.

18:31.220 --> 18:35.089
You're going through something
really profound right now,

18:35.090 --> 18:37.999
but I'm just... I'm not there yet.

18:38.000 --> 18:38.434
You're not?

18:38.435 --> 18:39.219
- No.
- You're right.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.199
I know. You're Marty Kaan.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.209
You're working.

18:42.210 --> 18:44.089
You're about to close Everyshirt.

18:44.090 --> 18:47.059
- There you go.
- But I... I see you.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.059
I see you, Marty.

18:50.060 --> 18:54.059
Because I have a God-eye right
in the center of my forehead.

18:54.060 --> 18:55.219
Right here.

18:55.220 --> 18:59.189
And it sees you, and it sees
that you have a giant circle

18:59.190 --> 19:02.169
around your head,

19:02.170 --> 19:05.229
like the mane of a lion.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.219
I just need some time to take it all in.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.089
Okay? Bye. Bye-bye.

19:26.090 --> 19:28.109
Fuck, that's soft.

19:28.110 --> 19:31.149
That's so soft.

19:31.150 --> 19:32.159
Dakota. Hey, Dakota.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.029
Dakota, it's Clyde.

19:34.030 --> 19:35.159
We're gonna make sweet, sweet love.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.069
I don't know you, man.

19:37.070 --> 19:39.189
You know Clyde. Beautiful
man. Sacred orgasm.

19:39.190 --> 19:41.199
We were near the pots and the spoons?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.110
I don't know you, fur man.

19:45.090 --> 19:48.159
I need to find my pants.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.019
You're Cobra.

19:57.020 --> 19:59.040
I am Cobra Lord.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.999
Guess I'm a lion, then.

20:15.190 --> 20:16.179
Motherfucker.

20:32.180 --> 20:34.229
Sean, Yurgen,

20:34.230 --> 20:37.149
janitorial staff, I.T. guys.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.149
I don't know what happened last night.

20:40.150 --> 20:41.189
I mean, was it real?

20:41.190 --> 20:43.229
I do not fucking know.

20:43.230 --> 20:45.029
Felt real.

20:45.030 --> 20:47.179
But what does "real" mean anymore?

20:47.180 --> 20:49.229
Object, subject, fantasy,

20:49.230 --> 20:51.209
reality... these words, they just

20:51.210 --> 20:55.049
they don't have the same
meaning for me anymore.

20:55.050 --> 20:56.129
I'll tell you what I do know.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.119
Sean and I, we left our physical bodies

20:59.120 --> 21:02.130
and we made an agreement
on a higher plane.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.179
And we agreed that Holacracy

21:14.180 --> 21:17.069
is a noble experiment
and it's worth a try.

21:17.070 --> 21:18.169
What the fuck?

21:18.170 --> 21:21.029
But you're gonna need us to
guide you, to advise you.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.209
Doug Guggenheim will be heading up

21:22.210 --> 21:25.109
our Holacracy transition advisory team.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.089
Right, Doug?

21:26.090 --> 21:27.189
Uh, what? Yes. Yes.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.129
There you go. Clyde Oberholt!

21:31.130 --> 21:32.189
Yes!

21:32.190 --> 21:36.189
I will, of course, be
moving the technology

21:36.190 --> 21:39.119
of Holacracy synergy and integration

21:39.120 --> 21:40.229
into the 25th century.

21:40.230 --> 21:43.009
I.T. team, do you hear me?

21:45.030 --> 21:47.119
Yes, yes. And Jeannie van
der Hooven and myself...

21:47.120 --> 21:50.059
Ooh! Will be working closely with Sean

21:50.060 --> 21:53.099
to continue to advance the vision quest

21:53.100 --> 21:56.009
that is Holacracy.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.029
Okay. Yeah.

22:00.030 --> 22:02.019
Because make no mistake, people,

22:02.020 --> 22:04.139
this is a vision quest.

22:04.140 --> 22:06.059
But it's gonna take work.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.999
It's going to take imagination.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.080
It's gonna take faith.

22:12.180 --> 22:14.169
And a fuck-load of after-work.

22:15.190 --> 22:17.149
Yeah!

22:21.150 --> 22:23.219
Marty!

22:23.220 --> 22:25.189
- Marty...
- Oh, boy.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.129
You fuck!

22:27.130 --> 22:29.109
You fuck! You piece of shit!

22:29.110 --> 22:31.189
You just fucked me in every hole!

22:31.190 --> 22:32.189
Whoa! Whoa. Okay.

22:32.190 --> 22:34.029
Just take a breath, all right, buddy?

22:34.030 --> 22:35.059
What? Take a breath?

22:35.060 --> 22:36.059
Yurgen, Yurgen, Yurgen.

22:36.060 --> 22:37.089
How much are you worth

22:37.090 --> 22:39.089
- thanks to Sean Chew?
- No, no.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.229
No, Marty. You don't get it.
What you just did to me...

22:40.230 --> 22:42.019
- You, you, you, you.
- You did it to me.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.169
You, you, you. How much, personally?

22:43.170 --> 22:44.120
You?

22:46.010 --> 22:47.030
On paper?

22:48.110 --> 22:49.189
Over a billion dollars.

22:49.190 --> 22:51.029
What? That's... huh? Over what?!

22:51.030 --> 22:52.049
Holy shit!

22:52.050 --> 22:53.129
That's amazing.

22:53.130 --> 22:56.059
So if Sean thinks that
Holacracy is the shit,

22:56.060 --> 22:58.059
don't you have the common
sense to just play that out?

22:58.060 --> 22:59.219
I mean, has he ever been right before?

22:59.220 --> 23:00.209
Let me see.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.209
Every fucking time.

23:02.210 --> 23:04.039
Come on.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.209
Yurgen.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.040
He's the Cobra Lord.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.109
Wait.

23:09.110 --> 23:11.019
How do you know about Cobra Lord?

23:11.020 --> 23:12.209
You're welcome.

23:12.210 --> 23:13.999
How do you know that?

23:19.040 --> 23:20.219
The fuck?

23:20.220 --> 23:22.039
Martin Kaan.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.129
Ron Zobel? What the...

23:23.130 --> 23:25.039
Oh, I agree, man.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.199
What the fuck am I doing here?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.089
I mean, after our last go-round, buddy,

23:28.090 --> 23:30.109
I thought, "Next time
I see that dickhead,

23:30.110 --> 23:31.219
I hope it's to piss
into his open coffin."

23:31.220 --> 23:33.109
Yeah. But I...

23:33.110 --> 23:35.119
But then I got your
message last night, man.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.199
And, I mean, the way you talked
about working together...

23:37.200 --> 23:39.139
What words did you use?
Hold it. You-you...

23:39.140 --> 23:41.119
you hyperintellectual mind-fucker.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.999
What was it?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.039
It was, uh, "co-operative biosphere

23:45.040 --> 23:47.019
of aggressive post-capitalism,"

23:47.020 --> 23:48.149
or whatever else you were talking about

23:48.150 --> 23:51.009
with the sort of... God and colors,

23:51.010 --> 23:52.229
and, I mean, it was genuinely,

23:52.230 --> 23:56.009
it was genuinely visionary...

23:56.010 --> 23:57.179
visionary stuff.

23:57.180 --> 24:00.069
So listen. I just have a couple
loose ends I need to tie up,

24:00.070 --> 24:01.139
you know, in some other sectors,

24:01.140 --> 24:03.189
but then, oh, I'm yours,

24:03.190 --> 24:05.129
balls deep, my brother.

24:05.130 --> 24:06.159
Um... okay, but...

24:06.160 --> 24:08.019
All right, now look, now look, now look.

24:08.020 --> 24:09.129
I know about Skip's offer, okay?

24:09.130 --> 24:11.119
And don't think that it didn't

24:11.120 --> 24:13.069
also influence my decision a little bit.

24:13.070 --> 24:15.149
And I know that you're less than
enthusiastic about this idea,

24:15.150 --> 24:17.059
but listen, you know what?
We're just gonna let it sit.

24:17.060 --> 24:20.129
Let's just let that brilliant
Martin Kaan mind just...

24:20.130 --> 24:22.119
Huh? Like bread and bouillabaisse, okay?

24:22.120 --> 24:23.179
'Cause we don't want your ex-wife

24:23.180 --> 24:25.149
walking away with all that money.

24:25.150 --> 24:26.999
My...

24:27.000 --> 24:28.120
Did you not know about that?

24:30.130 --> 24:32.219
She's the so-called "front-runner."

24:32.220 --> 24:34.039
But, listen, I'm betting

24:34.040 --> 24:36.019
we're gonna blow her
right out of the water!

24:36.020 --> 24:37.109
Yeah.

24:37.110 --> 24:40.019
Did you save that message?

24:42.140 --> 24:44.089
I don't know what that means.

24:44.090 --> 24:45.169
No, Ron, I need to hear the message.

24:45.170 --> 24:48.069
So they can't wear armor
or a mage's robe,

24:48.070 --> 24:49.999
uh, so obviously, in that scenario,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.099
the last thing you want to
be is a warforged monk.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.169
Okay.

24:54.170 --> 24:56.009
I guess that makes sense.

24:56.010 --> 24:57.169
Does it?

24:57.170 --> 24:58.219
Yeah? So does that...

24:59.220 --> 25:01.139
Yeah.

25:01.140 --> 25:03.150
All right, so that's...
that's what you're after?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.069
I mean, yeah, it's helpful.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.209
- The dumplings are great.
- Yeah.

25:08.210 --> 25:11.019
I-I mean, you wouldn't
think they'd travel,

25:11.020 --> 25:12.149
but...

25:12.150 --> 25:14.069
Honestly, they're...

25:14.070 --> 25:17.009
It's like magic dumplings or something.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.039
Yeah. Okay.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.229
I think, I think we both know
what I'm about to ask you,

25:22.230 --> 25:25.129
and, uh, I just, I wanted you to know...

25:25.130 --> 25:27.219
Okay, wait.

25:27.220 --> 25:30.129
Is this about my arcane spell failure?

25:30.130 --> 25:31.169
What? No.

25:31.170 --> 25:32.209
- Uh, no.
- 'Cause I...

25:32.210 --> 25:34.099
No, that was, that was bad,

25:34.100 --> 25:36.019
- but no, that's not what this is about.
- Okay, I...

25:36.020 --> 25:37.069
It's, um...

25:37.070 --> 25:39.079
Look, I-I think, uh...

25:39.080 --> 25:41.019
Well, am I way off,

25:41.020 --> 25:42.219
or-or do you think you might consider

25:42.220 --> 25:46.029
maybe, I don't know, um...

25:46.030 --> 25:47.209
uh...

25:47.210 --> 25:49.149
going out with me?

25:49.150 --> 25:52.039
Wow. That's so junior high.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.020
- No, I-I mean...
- Wait. No shame spiral.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.040
I didn't say that I wasn't into you.

26:03.170 --> 26:06.160
I am, actually, kind of into you.

26:08.130 --> 26:10.180
So, yeah, I would go out with you.

26:13.140 --> 26:14.159
Whatever.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.029
Did I see Ron Zobel in here?

26:24.030 --> 26:25.999
A while ago?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.179
Yeah. Um...

26:27.180 --> 26:29.129
Apparently, I was

26:29.130 --> 26:31.169
a little less in control

26:31.170 --> 26:34.149
than I thought I was last night,

26:34.150 --> 26:36.039
and I hired him.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.170
Good call.

26:39.210 --> 26:41.189
My brain feels like dog shit

26:41.190 --> 26:43.089
from that ayahuasca.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.219
But, man, was that something.

26:46.220 --> 26:48.049
I was a fucking lion.

26:48.050 --> 26:49.230
Yes, you were!

26:51.170 --> 26:53.139
Do you even want me

26:53.140 --> 26:55.169
back at K and A, Marty?

26:55.170 --> 26:57.029
Are you kidding me?

26:57.030 --> 26:59.090
Don't make a joke.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.029
I'm just...

27:03.030 --> 27:06.009
feeling very fragile,

27:06.010 --> 27:08.219
and, um, 'cause of the whole thing,

27:08.220 --> 27:12.089
and the ayahuasca has got
me questioning everything.

27:12.090 --> 27:15.109
Jeannie, I am fucking thrilled.

27:15.110 --> 27:17.150
I can't do this shit without you.

27:21.190 --> 27:22.160
Good answer.

27:24.020 --> 27:26.069
Oh, man.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.019
Mm...

27:28.020 --> 27:30.029
- It's a comfy couch, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

27:30.030 --> 27:32.049
You have one of those in your office?

27:32.050 --> 27:34.149
Oh! Yeah, gotcha.
