00:00.001 --> 00:01.640
Previously on Incorporated...

00:01.641 --> 00:05.107
- Take this. Bye, Aaron.
- I'll find you.

00:05.108 --> 00:07.287
- Aaron!
- Told you I'd find you.

00:07.288 --> 00:09.321
I just have so much
riding on this scholarship.

00:09.356 --> 00:11.257
But what about you?

00:11.258 --> 00:13.926
You may not realize your
dream of attending college.

00:13.962 --> 00:16.829
There could be a place for
you in the Spiga family.

00:16.864 --> 00:19.364
- Get away from my daughter.
- Okay.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.200
The guy who runs things
around here is named Tino,

00:21.235 --> 00:22.802
and I work for him. Your guy shoots,

00:22.837 --> 00:24.470
you don't make it to the wall alive.

00:24.505 --> 00:25.972
- What is this?
- $20,000.

00:26.007 --> 00:27.406
Where did you get this?

00:28.943 --> 00:31.276
My sister, she's a sex slave.
Where is she?

00:31.312 --> 00:32.645
- Arcadia.
- Can you get in here?

00:32.680 --> 00:34.379
Access is restricted to senior execs.

00:34.415 --> 00:35.194
I need a personnel file.

00:35.195 --> 00:37.850
This feels a little out of your
purview, doesn't it? Hendrick, right?

00:37.885 --> 00:39.518
Roger Caplan came to my office.

00:39.553 --> 00:40.786
I just need a little more time.

00:40.822 --> 00:42.421
This guy is onto you.

00:42.456 --> 00:44.023
I need you to get me into Arcadia.

00:44.058 --> 00:45.491
Who is it you're gunning for?

00:45.526 --> 00:47.893
There's someone standing in my way.

00:47.929 --> 00:49.328
- I have to go.
- Go? Wait...

00:49.363 --> 00:51.263
Presentation's at 1:00.

00:51.298 --> 00:55.101
I think he's connected
to one of the companions.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.854
12 YEARS AGO

01:05.841 --> 01:09.081
Hey, buck up, kid.

01:09.117 --> 01:11.416
I'm leaving you the shadow.

01:13.621 --> 01:15.721
There's a contact on the ghost drive...

01:15.757 --> 01:18.977
A guy named Tino, who will set you
up for work when you get out.

01:20.895 --> 01:22.628
I got you something too.

01:24.431 --> 01:26.699
It's a water key.

01:26.734 --> 01:29.748
Took me three days to get
through the metal yard for parts.

01:30.271 --> 01:34.740
It'll get you into any FEMA water truck.

01:34.776 --> 01:37.743
Well, if things don't
work out, I might need it.

01:37.779 --> 01:39.779
There won't be any water
trucks where I'm going...

01:39.814 --> 01:43.649
no rationing either, but this is good.

01:43.685 --> 01:46.886
This is really good.

01:46.921 --> 01:49.655
Thank you.

01:49.691 --> 01:51.924
Must be some back door you found.

01:51.959 --> 01:56.162
Yeah. Unfortunately, it's
about to close, so...

01:56.197 --> 01:58.097
I gotta go now.

02:00.702 --> 02:03.903
Hey...

02:05.472 --> 02:08.741
you're already better at
this than I ever was.

02:08.776 --> 02:12.344
Keep your head in the game.
You'll be fine. 'Kay?

02:12.379 --> 02:15.547
All visible religious
iconography, clothing,

02:15.583 --> 02:19.518
or headgear is strictly
prohibited in public spaces.

02:19.553 --> 02:20.786
Do me a favor?

02:23.157 --> 02:24.724
Check on Elena for me.

02:26.393 --> 02:28.327
Do yourself a favor.

02:28.362 --> 02:30.830
When you get out of
here, don't look back.

02:34.476 --> 02:38.121
6 YEARS AGO

02:39.841 --> 02:41.373
Hurry, please!

02:45.012 --> 02:47.312
What the hell are you waiting for?

02:47.348 --> 02:49.314
Restaurant didn't pay their bills.

02:49.350 --> 02:50.916
We're here to make sure that
the fire doesn't spread

02:50.952 --> 02:52.752
to the places that did.

02:52.787 --> 02:55.454
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:55.489 --> 02:57.823
Hey!

02:59.827 --> 03:02.494
Try that again, you get
the other side of the axe.

03:02.529 --> 03:05.965
No, no...

03:06.000 --> 03:07.466
No!

03:10.805 --> 03:13.939
You son of a bitch. You did this.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.307
No-no-no-no-no!

03:15.342 --> 03:16.809
Aaron didn't do anything.

03:16.844 --> 03:19.344
He scammed the money
exchange in broad daylight.

03:19.380 --> 03:20.946
You think I didn't hear about that?

03:20.982 --> 03:22.547
The whole neighborhood knows.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.549
We got caught in the crossfire,
because you shorted Tino

03:24.585 --> 03:27.186
and his cut, didn't you?

03:27.221 --> 03:30.322
Didn't you?

03:30.357 --> 03:32.557
You think Tino did this?

03:32.593 --> 03:35.627
Everything we built... it's gone.

03:35.663 --> 03:37.029
It's all gone.

George Caplan? I'm Anastasia.

05:00.114 --> 05:01.646
Thank you for meeting me here.

05:01.682 --> 05:03.215
I'm intrigued.

05:03.251 --> 05:06.018
You must be quite a
powerful man to merit this.

05:06.053 --> 05:08.520
That's why I need you
to keep it between us.

05:08.555 --> 05:10.489
- Can you do that?
- Of course.

05:10.524 --> 05:12.457
That's what we do.

05:12.493 --> 05:15.761
As long as this stays in
place, I'm yours completely.

05:17.765 --> 05:20.399
The three of us then?

05:20.637 --> 05:23.402
Just... just me.

05:23.408 --> 05:25.304
Please have a seat.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.941
Last words of advice.

05:28.976 --> 05:31.443
Do what you have to do
to get what you need.

05:31.478 --> 05:34.013
She's just a piece of company property.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.653
Anastasia was it?

05:41.688 --> 05:45.190
- It's really nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

05:47.194 --> 05:49.361
It's real. Go ahead.

05:49.397 --> 05:51.063
Music.

05:56.904 --> 06:00.339
So let me explain.
That... that man is my father,

06:00.374 --> 06:02.174
and I have a... a problem.

06:02.209 --> 06:05.044
It's not physical.

06:05.079 --> 06:07.980
Dad thought that this might help.

06:08.015 --> 06:09.815
I understand.

06:11.718 --> 06:14.519
Just relax, and let me do everything.

06:32.683 --> 06:33.372
Oh, jeez, sorry.

06:33.407 --> 06:35.080
I didn't think you'd get here so fast.

06:35.081 --> 06:36.342
Can I have a few minutes?

06:36.377 --> 06:38.243
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

06:44.507 --> 06:47.519
Can you tell me about yourself first?

06:47.554 --> 06:51.190
It's a... it's a trust thing.

06:51.225 --> 06:53.325
What do you wanna know?

06:53.763 --> 06:55.560
Where are you from?

06:55.596 --> 06:58.730
What are your passions?

06:58.765 --> 07:00.532
Let's see...

07:00.567 --> 07:04.203
My parents were diplomats, so
I grew up all over the world.

07:04.238 --> 07:07.006
Attended a girls' school in Switzerland.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.041
The campus was way out in the country...

07:09.076 --> 07:11.543
no boys around for miles.

07:11.578 --> 07:13.112
Sometimes, when we got lonely,

07:13.147 --> 07:14.613
my roommate, Silvie, and I used to...

07:14.648 --> 07:18.717
Okay, look, I know
this is a little weird,

07:18.752 --> 07:22.821
but if this is gonna work,
I need the real you.

07:22.856 --> 07:26.791
Not that softcore bullshit
they make you memorize.

07:26.827 --> 07:29.361
Please?

07:29.397 --> 07:31.263
If it helps, I guarantee

07:31.298 --> 07:33.765
that I will not keep you very long.

07:41.509 --> 07:43.642
Come on. Where... where
are you really from?

07:43.677 --> 07:46.645
Mr. Caplan, you know
I can't tell you that.

07:47.526 --> 07:49.714
Okay. Mr. Caplan.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.450
Message received.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.719
It must be exhausting.

07:54.755 --> 07:58.290
Losers like me blather on
all day about our problems.

08:00.127 --> 08:01.660
Well...

08:01.695 --> 08:05.931
I can tell you my parents
weren't diplomats.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.766
Oh, yeah?

08:07.801 --> 08:11.236
What did your dad really do?

08:11.272 --> 08:12.837
Nothing interesting.

08:12.873 --> 08:14.673
My dad negotiates grain contracts.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.475
It has to be more interesting than that.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.021
My father...

08:30.057 --> 08:33.924
he had a little restaurant
in Franklin Heights.

08:33.961 --> 08:36.260
Had?

08:36.297 --> 08:38.897
It's gone now.

08:38.932 --> 08:41.633
I'm sorry.

08:41.668 --> 08:43.434
I just made you sad, didn't I?

08:46.673 --> 08:48.107
I'm not sad.

08:48.142 --> 08:50.842
I'm very happy to be here with you.

08:50.877 --> 08:52.544
Separate building systems.

08:52.580 --> 08:54.513
Ben was right about you.

08:54.548 --> 08:57.983
- Ben...
- Ben Larson.

08:58.018 --> 09:00.185
He's a... he's a friend from work.

09:00.221 --> 09:01.987
He said you were special.

09:02.022 --> 09:04.889
Ben Larson?

09:04.925 --> 09:06.658
Never heard of him.

09:06.693 --> 09:08.627
It's okay.

09:08.662 --> 09:10.862
We're alone.

09:10.897 --> 09:13.298
How did you two meet?

09:13.334 --> 09:15.800
What does this about?

09:15.836 --> 09:19.371
It's about Ben Larson.

09:19.406 --> 09:22.174
I told you. I don't know him.

09:22.209 --> 09:25.144
Well, I think you do.

09:25.179 --> 09:29.781
And you're gonna tell
me the truth right now.

09:29.816 --> 09:31.351
The truth?

09:31.352 --> 09:32.717
AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM:
ACCESS RESTRICTED

09:32.753 --> 09:34.353
Sure. The truth is that with your pants off,

09:34.388 --> 09:38.190
all you limp dicks look the same to me.

09:38.225 --> 09:39.591
No...

09:41.395 --> 09:44.496
Now I am going to ask you again,

09:44.532 --> 09:46.465
and if you don't answer...

09:46.500 --> 09:48.733
then I start carving.

09:48.769 --> 09:53.038
Maybe they fix ya; maybe
they just let ya scar up.

09:53.073 --> 09:55.974
Do you know where Spiga
sends girls like that?

09:56.009 --> 09:59.344
To the silos to service the grain crews.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.513
You can cut me.

10:01.549 --> 10:03.948
I've been cut many times before.

10:03.984 --> 10:06.385
A client used to hold
my head under water...

10:06.420 --> 10:10.021
said it helped him cope with
the stress from the office.

10:10.057 --> 10:12.023
There is nothing you can dream up

10:12.059 --> 10:14.259
in your sick, twisted imagination

10:14.295 --> 10:16.127
that I have not endured in this job.

10:16.163 --> 10:20.399
- Come on.
- So go ahead. Make me scream.

10:20.434 --> 10:22.301
But you'll get the same answer.

10:23.604 --> 10:26.171
I don't know Ben Larson.

10:27.541 --> 10:29.808
How deep do you want me to go?

10:29.843 --> 10:33.612
However deep you want.

10:51.898 --> 10:53.699

10:53.734 --> 10:55.500
Please use the oxygen rebreather units

10:55.536 --> 10:57.035
provided in your room.

10:57.070 --> 11:00.171
Then exit the building
in an orderly fashion.

11:00.207 --> 11:02.507
There has been an
atmospheric contamination.

11:02.543 --> 11:04.376
Please use the oxygen rebreather units

11:04.411 --> 11:07.078
provided in your room.
Then exit the building...

11:10.050 --> 11:12.651
Evacuation is in progress.

11:12.686 --> 11:14.253
Please stay calm.

11:14.288 --> 11:17.322
15 rooms.

11:17.358 --> 11:19.023
- Let's go!
- We're rolling out.

11:35.552 --> 11:37.284
Answer.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.687
Ben, the presentation
is in ten minutes.

11:39.723 --> 11:41.622
Where are you?

11:41.658 --> 11:44.024
The presentation. Right. I...

11:44.060 --> 11:46.193
Sorry, I'm... I had to
take care of something.

11:46.229 --> 11:48.363
I'm on my way.

11:50.866 --> 11:54.193
ROGER CAPLAN:
SUBJECT ENTERING TO RED ZONE

12:36.345 --> 12:38.112
- Come on, let's go again.
- Laura...

12:38.147 --> 12:39.747
No, I know. I get it.

12:39.783 --> 12:42.750
I dropped my guard. I tensed up.
Let's just go again.

12:42.786 --> 12:44.952
The point of Past Trauma
Re-experiential Therapy

12:44.987 --> 12:46.854
is not to pound your
trauma into submission.

12:46.890 --> 12:48.289
It's to explore every facet

12:48.324 --> 12:50.491
of what's causing your emotional pain.

12:50.527 --> 12:52.993
Fine. Let's explore it.

12:53.029 --> 12:54.995
Go again.

12:55.031 --> 12:56.431
We need to talk about your feelings.

12:56.466 --> 12:58.332
Oh, my God.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.635
That's how this works? You
want it to work, don't ya?

13:00.670 --> 13:03.471
Look, I have tried cognitive
enhancement diversion,

13:03.506 --> 13:07.041
wearables, drugs, even a goddamn VR pet,

13:07.076 --> 13:08.676
and now this crap.

13:08.711 --> 13:11.078
It's all bullshit.

13:11.113 --> 13:12.747
Everyone things that they
know what I went through,

13:12.782 --> 13:14.315
but they don't.

13:20.089 --> 13:21.489
I have to go.

13:29.532 --> 13:32.166
- Where the hell were you?
- I got held up.

13:32.201 --> 13:33.768
The Deck isn't even finished yet.

13:33.803 --> 13:36.103
It's fine.

13:36.138 --> 13:38.339
I got this.

13:41.344 --> 13:44.044
- Mr. Larson, you're late.
- I know.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.246
- I told you...
- I'm sorry.

13:46.816 --> 13:48.851

13:48.852 --> 13:50.651
Ben...

13:50.941 --> 13:53.521
Go.

14:00.930 --> 14:03.598
Counterintelligence used to...

14:03.633 --> 14:05.633
Sorry.

14:08.671 --> 14:10.237
Counterintelligence used to be about

14:10.272 --> 14:13.007
breaking into security
systems and databases,

14:13.042 --> 14:14.709
but now, thanks to Everclear,

14:14.744 --> 14:17.812
it's about breaking into the human mind.

14:17.847 --> 14:20.381
We no longer rely on outdated
interrogation techniques.

14:20.416 --> 14:23.250
We can now literally
turn people's brainwaves

14:23.285 --> 14:27.822
into usable images and
actionable intelligence.

14:32.228 --> 14:34.128
Boris...

14:34.163 --> 14:36.931
what the hell is wrong with you?

14:36.966 --> 14:39.033
Lack of good role models probably.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.206
Are you sure this is the place?

14:46.242 --> 14:49.076
Girl's a high-end spreader
from Franklin Heights.

14:49.111 --> 14:51.012
This is where they got her.

14:51.047 --> 14:53.948
Of course, if you want some
A-plus brainiac yum-yum...

14:53.983 --> 14:57.451
You're disgusting and
I hate that I know you.

14:57.486 --> 14:59.186
Nice doing business.

14:59.221 --> 15:02.190
We're reopening a background
check into one of your students.

15:02.191 --> 15:05.325
She was recruited into
Arcadia a few years ago?

15:06.160 --> 15:08.195
Elena Marquez.

15:08.230 --> 15:10.130
That takes me back.

15:10.166 --> 15:13.467
We didn't have an empty
seat in those days.

15:13.502 --> 15:15.069
You have one or two kids stroke out,

15:15.104 --> 15:17.504
and you're a pariah.

15:17.540 --> 15:20.675
- Is Elena in trouble?
- No... no, nothing like that.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.176
A high-level Spiga executive

15:22.211 --> 15:23.678
is interested in acquiring her contract,

15:23.713 --> 15:25.446
but we're having trouble
reaching her next of kin

15:25.481 --> 15:27.281
to update the payout agreements.

15:27.316 --> 15:29.684
Those sealed Arcadia
personnel files are

15:29.719 --> 15:31.385
a real pain in the ass.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.416
STUDENT DATABASE

15:34.057 --> 15:38.993
Technically, my files should
be locked just as tight.

15:46.502 --> 15:48.435
There's only one contact for her.

15:48.471 --> 15:51.639
- How do you want it?
- Quietly.

15:51.674 --> 15:53.975
By isolating the neurons
in sectors one-four-seven,

15:54.010 --> 15:56.176
in one-four-nine, and one-six-two,

15:56.212 --> 15:57.612
my team has had remarkable success

15:57.647 --> 15:59.446
in extracting actionable data.

15:59.482 --> 16:01.115
And best of all, we can remove the data

16:01.150 --> 16:03.684
with precision at the end
of the employee's contract

16:03.720 --> 16:06.787
without causing permanent
damage as we have in the past.

16:06.823 --> 16:08.322
Why erase everything when we can erase

16:08.357 --> 16:10.524
only our proprietary information?

16:14.530 --> 16:17.431
We hope to have Everclear online
within the next three months.

16:17.466 --> 16:21.368
Unless you have any
questions, that's all I have.

16:21.403 --> 16:23.738
Let me ask just one question.

16:23.773 --> 16:26.874
We're a bio-tech company, correct?

16:26.909 --> 16:28.575
- Yes.
- And our firm focuses on

16:28.611 --> 16:30.277
the development of genetic strains,

16:30.312 --> 16:32.680
new agricultural products,
and the production of food

16:32.715 --> 16:35.716
- for the entire goddamn world?
- Yes.

16:35.752 --> 16:37.718
Then if you could explain
to me what the hell

16:37.754 --> 16:39.854
we need a mind-reading device for.

16:39.889 --> 16:41.956
It's okay. I'll handle this.

16:41.991 --> 16:45.726
Expenditures for prevention
of intellectual theft

16:45.762 --> 16:49.697
account or a full 40%
of our security budget.

16:49.732 --> 16:54.268
Everclear allows us to apply
those funds elsewhere.

16:54.303 --> 16:56.737
And what about the millions
you've already spent?

16:56.773 --> 16:58.539
It will shore up the security gaps

16:58.574 --> 17:00.675
I've already flagged for you.

17:01.465 --> 17:02.910
The gaps that almost allowed

17:02.945 --> 17:05.945
Chad Peterson to steal our protocols.

17:05.982 --> 17:08.315
To the next of kin of Elena Marquez,

17:08.349 --> 17:10.550
we regret to inform you that
your daughter's contract

17:10.586 --> 17:12.519
has been terminated prematurely.

17:12.555 --> 17:15.189
If you would like to receive
the full death benefit payout,

17:15.223 --> 17:18.492
please meet our representative
at the address on record tonight

17:18.527 --> 17:22.462
at... 5:30 p.m.

17:22.498 --> 17:24.131
Letterhead and send.

17:27.435 --> 17:29.770
David, I know we haven't
always seen eye to eye,

17:29.806 --> 17:32.306
but if you are questioning
my performance...

17:32.341 --> 17:34.709
What I am questioning are
the time and resources

17:34.744 --> 17:36.844
you're continuing to spend
on a white rhino chase.

17:36.879 --> 17:40.614
Everclear is not a white rhino, sir.

17:40.649 --> 17:43.417
It's going to be operational
within the month actually.

17:43.452 --> 17:45.019
Oh, really?

17:45.054 --> 17:48.589
Then why does your
presentation not reflect that?

17:48.624 --> 17:52.793
Because Ms. Krauss taught
me to never over-promise.

17:52.829 --> 17:57.064
But it will be up and
running by month's end.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.700
Thank you, Mr. Larson.

17:59.736 --> 18:01.401
We'll reconvene and hear

18:01.437 --> 18:04.939
the next candidate's
presentation in one hour.

18:08.978 --> 18:11.411
Ben...

18:14.217 --> 18:18.018
I'm sorry. I overstepped my bounds.

18:18.054 --> 18:21.021
I appreciate your loyalty.

18:21.057 --> 18:22.589
Of course.

18:22.625 --> 18:25.659
Just be careful.

18:25.694 --> 18:28.462
You made some big claims in there.

18:28.497 --> 18:30.530
We all need to make sure we deliver.

18:30.566 --> 18:33.033
Yes, ma'am.

18:40.410 --> 18:44.174
6 YEARS AGO

18:44.274 --> 18:46.446
Please be advised.

18:46.482 --> 18:49.907
No communication devices are
allowed inside the facility.

18:49.908 --> 18:51.671
DEBTORS EXTRACTION SERVICES LLC.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.221
Visiting time is limited to one hour.

19:54.583 --> 19:58.152
I've done the math.

19:58.187 --> 20:01.155
With what they're charging
for room and board,

20:01.190 --> 20:04.992
plus the interest, plus
what we owe the bank,

20:05.027 --> 20:09.864
even with you and I working
80 hours a week each...

20:09.899 --> 20:13.968
we'll still be in debt
for the next 138 years.

20:14.003 --> 20:15.802
When you're gone, they'll come for me,

20:15.838 --> 20:19.073
and then when I die, they'll take Theo.

20:20.877 --> 20:24.011
This is the first time I ever
wished you weren't so smart.

20:24.046 --> 20:26.347
I should go.

20:28.751 --> 20:32.019
I promised Theo I'd make him dinner.

20:32.054 --> 20:34.889
You're a good girl, Elena.

20:48.590 --> 20:52.396
PRESENT DAY

20:58.480 --> 21:00.547
You're Elena Marquez's next of kin?

21:00.582 --> 21:02.849
- What happened to her?
- Sir, you know the contract

21:02.885 --> 21:07.302
she signed restricts any dissemination
of details related to her employment.

21:07.303 --> 21:09.357
Are you gonna stand there and tell
me nothing about my daughter?

21:09.358 --> 21:12.026
Sir, this is just procedure.

21:12.061 --> 21:13.827
Provide me with some information,

21:13.862 --> 21:16.964
and then we can discuss
the employee's demise.

21:16.999 --> 21:19.533
How'd she...

21:19.568 --> 21:21.201
Did she suffer?

21:21.237 --> 21:25.172
No. Nothing like that.

21:25.207 --> 21:28.042
But I will need the information.

21:28.077 --> 21:31.245
Can you identify this man?

21:34.817 --> 21:37.318
That's the piece of shit
that ruined her life.

21:40.056 --> 21:42.656
You wanna help me ruin his?

21:46.543 --> 21:49.439
- With the grain this time.
- Yes, Tino.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.940
If I wanna look like I
was in a street fight,

21:50.976 --> 21:52.341
I'll get in a goddamn street fight.

21:56.787 --> 21:59.621
Why did you do it?

21:59.657 --> 22:03.525
Aaron?

22:03.561 --> 22:05.160
You got some balls, kid.

22:05.195 --> 22:09.130
You ruined her life for a $20,000 haul.

22:09.166 --> 22:12.634
What the hell are you talking about?

22:12.670 --> 22:15.604
The currency exchange thing?
I heard all about that.

22:15.639 --> 22:17.405
I just figured you were
gonna make it up to me.

22:17.441 --> 22:19.608
This little stunt I'm less happy about.

22:19.643 --> 22:21.677
You're telling me you didn't
burn down our family's place.

22:21.712 --> 22:24.580
Why would I do that? I love the tacos.

22:24.615 --> 22:26.014
Besides, she just made a deal

22:26.049 --> 22:28.550
to settle up everything she owes me.

22:28.586 --> 22:31.487
- She what?
- Yeah.

22:31.522 --> 22:35.591
Hey, where do you think she's
gonna get that money from, huh?

22:35.626 --> 22:37.493
I mean...

22:37.528 --> 22:39.995
she could sell all her organs.

22:42.232 --> 22:44.533
Fuck.

22:44.568 --> 22:47.335
I'm gonna forgive this one time,

22:47.371 --> 22:48.971
because I can remember what it was like

22:49.006 --> 22:51.339
to be under the spell
of some Grade A pussy.

22:57.741 --> 22:59.482
SUBJECT ARRIVING:
EL GORDO GUSTAVO RESTAURANT

22:59.483 --> 23:01.483
Dammit, Roger.

23:01.519 --> 23:04.653
- Take me to the tracker point.
- Routing to El Gordo Gustavo.

23:04.688 --> 23:07.923
Location is currently out of business.

23:22.072 --> 23:23.705
Thanks for coming.

23:27.444 --> 23:31.312
So I hear you caused a riot.

23:32.403 --> 23:34.550
I wouldn't say that...

23:36.486 --> 23:38.921
Though, maybe a small one.

23:38.956 --> 23:40.923
You doing okay?

23:41.879 --> 23:44.660
Honestly, I've been better.

23:45.663 --> 23:47.596
Is it Ben?

23:47.631 --> 23:50.498
No... he's great.

23:50.534 --> 23:52.834
I mean, you know how work is, but...

23:52.870 --> 23:54.502
no, he's fine.

23:54.538 --> 23:57.806
It's just...

23:59.710 --> 24:02.678
I've been having the episodes again.

24:02.713 --> 24:05.213
Are you seeing your therapist?

24:05.248 --> 24:07.849
I just quit another one today.

24:07.885 --> 24:12.654
Look, I need to say something,
and it's something that...

24:12.690 --> 24:15.423
God, I feel ridiculous.

24:15.459 --> 24:18.894
Laura, whatever it is...

24:18.929 --> 24:21.129
Since...

24:21.164 --> 24:24.432
what happened,

24:24.468 --> 24:27.335
I...

24:27.370 --> 24:30.338
I haven't been on the
other side of the wall.

24:30.373 --> 24:32.273
Not once.

24:32.309 --> 24:33.642
In eight years?

24:37.314 --> 24:38.914
It's okay.

24:38.949 --> 24:42.751
Trust me, there's nothing out there.

24:42.786 --> 24:46.855
That doesn't make me feel
like any less of a prisoner.

24:46.890 --> 24:48.323
It's fine, Laura.

24:48.358 --> 24:51.426
You are fine.

24:51.461 --> 24:53.695
You've seen a lot of things...

24:53.731 --> 24:57.432
in the war, your job...

24:57.467 --> 25:00.068
Sure.

25:00.104 --> 25:02.570
But you don't need therapy.

25:02.606 --> 25:06.875
Well, doing it and needing
it are two different things.

25:06.910 --> 25:09.177
So you just deal with it.

25:10.981 --> 25:13.148
How?

25:13.183 --> 25:15.316
I don't...

25:15.352 --> 25:18.520
not really.

25:18.555 --> 25:21.189
There was this guy under my command

25:21.224 --> 25:24.760
during the Oil Wars.

25:24.795 --> 25:27.095
Smart, fast.

25:27.131 --> 25:31.033
Understood strategy like
nobody I've ever seen.

25:31.068 --> 25:33.101
I'm not a proud man.

25:33.137 --> 25:35.403
I know when someone's smarter than me,

25:35.438 --> 25:38.273
and this kid was,

25:38.308 --> 25:41.143
so I leaned on him more and more.

25:41.178 --> 25:43.511
The brass were planning a raid

25:43.547 --> 25:46.347
on a refinery outside of Cape Town.

25:46.383 --> 25:48.083
I was against it,

25:48.118 --> 25:52.187
so I asked this brilliant kid...
my guy...

25:52.222 --> 25:54.690
He told me we could do it.

25:54.725 --> 25:57.392
He knew just where they'd be.

25:57.427 --> 26:00.028
So I caved.

26:00.064 --> 26:03.298
I trusted his judgment more than my own.

26:03.333 --> 26:05.901
We marched in...

26:05.936 --> 26:09.337
and then they hit us hard.

26:09.372 --> 26:12.574
I lost 2,000 men in three minutes.

26:12.609 --> 26:15.143
Jesus.

26:15.179 --> 26:18.847
Now as I lay there, bleeding out,

26:18.882 --> 26:23.384
I saw him... my guy...

26:23.420 --> 26:25.053
with the insurgents.

26:27.490 --> 26:32.094
He was sent to gain our trust
and destroy us from within.

26:32.129 --> 26:34.362
And I let him do it.

26:34.397 --> 26:37.665
Hell, I helped him do it.

26:37.701 --> 26:41.536
It wasn't your fault.

26:41.571 --> 26:45.841
Neither was what happened to you.

26:45.876 --> 26:48.376
Doesn't feel like it.

26:48.411 --> 26:52.881
It never will.

26:52.916 --> 26:55.951
You have to make a decision.

26:55.986 --> 26:58.053
Are you gonna let one twist of fate

26:58.088 --> 26:59.921
decide who you are?

27:03.227 --> 27:06.094
Dad, I found something... something...

27:06.130 --> 27:07.896
God, it'll end her.

27:07.931 --> 27:10.298
It'll end Elizabeth Krauss.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.234
I just need one last piece, and then...

27:12.269 --> 27:15.003
then when we go to The Board
and tell them what I found.

27:17.407 --> 27:19.107
Call me as soon as you can.

27:21.860 --> 27:23.611
NEW VOICE MESSAGE

27:30.720 --> 27:33.133
Hello...

27:33.134 --> 27:34.829
Aaron.

27:50.565 --> 27:53.679
Any pregnancies? Abortions?

27:53.680 --> 27:55.079
No.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.614
Number of sexual partners?

27:57.650 --> 28:00.651
- One.
- I hope he was worth it.

28:01.820 --> 28:04.187
Payout's 30% more for a virgin.

28:04.222 --> 28:06.456
Mr. Brownston!

28:09.194 --> 28:12.829
Negative for STIs and parasites,

28:12.864 --> 28:14.864
and she's had all of her inoculations.

28:16.935 --> 28:19.002
Standard 20-year contract...

28:19.037 --> 28:20.837
the usual disclaimers.

28:20.872 --> 28:23.239
I can offer you this signing bonus today,

28:23.275 --> 28:27.744
and this payout at the
conclusion of your contract.

28:27.780 --> 28:30.046
And my father will be
released right away?

28:30.081 --> 28:32.949
We can have him out in an hour.

28:32.984 --> 28:35.218
All the money goes
to him and my brother.

28:35.253 --> 28:39.556
Less your debt to the bank, yes.

28:39.591 --> 28:41.391
All you have to do is sign.

28:44.396 --> 28:46.896
Elena! Wait!

28:48.396 --> 28:49.132
Elena!

28:49.167 --> 28:51.501
Girls like us are the
lucky ones, Elena.

28:51.537 --> 28:53.203
We have something to trade.

28:53.238 --> 28:55.839
If you sign this, you'll
be giving up everything...

28:55.874 --> 28:58.442
your freedom, your rights, your name.

28:58.477 --> 29:00.143
Tell her!

29:00.178 --> 29:01.945
Ms. Marquez has been fully briefed

29:01.980 --> 29:03.450
on the terms of her employment.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.515
Did they tell you that you become
the property of Spiga?

29:05.551 --> 29:07.083
Just give me a week.

29:07.118 --> 29:08.618
Just give me a week.
I'll find another way.

29:08.654 --> 29:12.322
Aaron, my dad will be dead in a week.

29:12.358 --> 29:13.490
But Elena... Don't!

29:14.267 --> 29:15.325
No!

29:15.853 --> 29:16.893
Aaron!

29:19.865 --> 29:22.466
Listen to me...

29:22.501 --> 29:25.702
If you love me, I need
you to do one thing...

29:27.773 --> 29:29.906
Forget about me.

29:39.017 --> 29:41.785
That's why my closure rate is over 90%.

29:41.820 --> 29:43.687
The fire...

29:43.722 --> 29:46.490
You started it?

29:46.525 --> 29:49.826
You destroyed our life for
a fucking commission?

30:08.814 --> 30:13.049
Hello... Aaron.

30:13.084 --> 30:14.418
Roger, it's not what you think.

30:14.453 --> 30:15.985
What?

30:16.021 --> 30:17.888
that you're a skint from a 'fugee camp

30:17.923 --> 30:20.490
who assumed a Green Zone identity?

30:20.526 --> 30:23.827
That you've lied to every
person you've ever met?

30:23.862 --> 30:28.832
What part of what I
just said is not true?

30:28.867 --> 30:31.701
I always knew the family
man thing was bullshit,

30:31.737 --> 30:34.638
but growing up here...

30:34.673 --> 30:38.174
with all the dose-ers
and the chicken necks?

30:38.209 --> 30:40.844
It's amazing you can eat
with a knife and fork.

30:43.381 --> 30:45.816
I can give you what you want.

30:45.851 --> 30:47.651
Yeah?

30:47.686 --> 30:50.053
Yeah, I tell Elizabeth I'm out,

30:50.088 --> 30:52.789
and then I convince her to
give you the promotion.

30:52.825 --> 30:56.092
You expect me to believe
you've got the juice for that?

30:56.127 --> 30:58.662
She's my mother-in-law.

30:58.697 --> 31:01.230
Lauren and I are giving
her her first grandchild.

31:01.266 --> 31:03.867
You look your wife in the
face every goddamn day

31:03.902 --> 31:07.003
and lie to her, and I'm
supposed to trust you?

31:07.038 --> 31:10.640
You know everything, Roger.

31:10.676 --> 31:13.710
I don't do exactly what
you say, I'm done.

31:16.147 --> 31:18.448
All I need is one thing.

31:18.484 --> 31:20.149
Get me into Arcadia.

31:22.855 --> 31:26.490
I can't let her die in that place.

31:26.525 --> 31:28.859
Roger...

31:28.894 --> 31:31.361
Do we have a deal?

31:31.396 --> 31:33.563
Sure.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.473
Get me into Arcadia.

31:43.509 --> 31:46.409
I can't let her die in that place.

31:53.385 --> 31:56.085
That you've lied to every
person you've ever met...

31:58.456 --> 32:01.290
I always knew the family
man thing was bullshit...

32:17.208 --> 32:18.742
You're gonna destroy everything.

32:21.780 --> 32:23.580
I can't let you hurt my family.

32:23.615 --> 32:25.381
You know everything, Roger.

32:25.417 --> 32:27.383
I don't do exactly what
you say, I'm done.

32:27.419 --> 32:29.920
All I need is one thing.

32:29.955 --> 32:31.487
Get me into Arcadia.

32:31.523 --> 32:33.356
I can't let her die in that place.

32:35.661 --> 32:38.562
- Do we have a deal?
- Sure.

32:40.532 --> 32:42.098
Roger, it's not what you think.

32:42.133 --> 32:46.135
No!

32:46.171 --> 32:48.738
That you've lied to every
person you've ever met?

32:48.774 --> 32:51.474
What part of what I
just said is not true?

32:51.509 --> 32:53.009
No! No!

32:57.098 --> 32:59.400
Aaron?

32:59.436 --> 33:02.403
Holy shit.

33:07.243 --> 33:09.109
What happened?

33:09.145 --> 33:11.846
He knew who I was.

33:11.881 --> 33:14.449
I had no choice.

33:14.484 --> 33:16.417
Everything I'm doing...

33:16.453 --> 33:20.555
everything... is for Elena.

33:24.494 --> 33:26.494
You know that, right?

33:30.734 --> 33:34.201
We need to take care of this.

33:34.237 --> 33:36.203
What are we gonna do with him?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.374
I spoofed the location tracking

33:39.409 --> 33:42.109
to show Roger stopped miles from here.

33:42.144 --> 33:45.246
I gave his car a fake SysID.
It's a ghost now.

33:48.351 --> 33:49.851
Hold onto this.

33:49.886 --> 33:51.386
Why?

33:51.421 --> 33:53.855
Because we're gonna need it.

34:06.235 --> 34:08.135
Where are you gonna send him?

34:08.170 --> 34:10.004
South.

34:10.039 --> 34:14.275
There'll be no cops once it
reaches the dust-storm states.

34:14.310 --> 34:17.077
The car will get stripped;
the body will get dumped.

34:17.112 --> 34:20.637
If the sun's shining, it should have enough
power to make it to the Mexican wall.

34:22.251 --> 34:24.150
I cranked the heat up.

34:24.186 --> 34:26.853
He'll be unrecognizable by
the time they find him.

34:30.827 --> 34:33.594
I saw her, Theo.

34:33.630 --> 34:36.163
- What?
- Elena.

34:36.197 --> 34:38.599
You... you saw her?

34:38.635 --> 34:41.368
I was 20 feet away from her...

34:41.404 --> 34:42.770
at a hotel. I...

34:42.806 --> 34:44.438
Why the hell didn't you get her?

34:44.474 --> 34:45.907
- I couldn't.
- Why not?!

34:45.942 --> 34:48.609
You think I could just take her?

34:48.645 --> 34:51.446
If I get past her guards, then what?

34:51.481 --> 34:53.179
They'd hunt us down, Theo.

34:53.215 --> 34:54.882
There's nowhere for us to
run... nowhere to hide.

34:54.918 --> 34:57.885
We have to think long-term.

34:57.921 --> 35:00.120
And now, with the body, the watch...

35:00.156 --> 35:03.791
it's all going to help us.

35:03.827 --> 35:07.227
I have a plan, Theo.
You have to trust me.

35:10.934 --> 35:14.301
You're a real piece of shit, Aaron.

35:19.776 --> 35:21.342
I know.

35:44.868 --> 35:47.101
How'd you sneak past
the guy's downstairs?

35:47.136 --> 35:49.003
Told them I was your father.

35:49.038 --> 35:51.639
You also tell them I
didn't wanna see you here?

35:51.674 --> 35:53.440
Theo, Elena's dead.

35:53.476 --> 35:55.175
No, she's not.

35:56.190 --> 35:58.379
No, she's not dead.

35:58.414 --> 36:00.982
Aaron killed her.

36:01.017 --> 36:04.552
Aaron would never hurt her.

36:04.587 --> 36:06.186
He's ruined everything.

36:06.222 --> 36:10.190
You ruined everything.

36:10.226 --> 36:14.361
My sister gave her life for
you, and you did what?

36:14.397 --> 36:18.132
You got shit-faced and bailed on me.

36:18.167 --> 36:20.735
I was just a kid.

36:24.974 --> 36:29.076
I want you gone by the
time I wake up tomorrow.

36:52.535 --> 36:54.201
Some Red Zone dive.

36:54.236 --> 36:56.070
Whole department's high on blur.

36:56.105 --> 36:59.640
The boss just dropped 10
grand on a cage fight.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.643
Well, you know I hate these things.

37:02.679 --> 37:07.381
Yeah, well, the second I
see an opening, I'm out.

37:07.416 --> 37:09.584
You're the best.

37:09.619 --> 37:11.819
Okay, well, kiss the
baby for me, all right?

37:11.854 --> 37:15.790
And... I'll be home as soon as I can.

37:15.825 --> 37:18.325
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm sorry I'm late.

37:18.360 --> 37:19.660
Can I get... a whiskey?

37:19.696 --> 37:21.295
This is nuts, right?

37:27.737 --> 37:31.038
- Hey! Hey!
- Reed...

37:35.344 --> 37:37.778
- Aaron?
- Long time no see, Reed.

37:37.814 --> 37:40.347
Hey, keep your voice down.

37:40.382 --> 37:42.449
My name is Hendrick now.

37:42.485 --> 37:44.251
What are you wearing?

37:44.286 --> 37:45.953
- Oh, is this real silk?
- Hey... hey...

37:45.989 --> 37:47.788
What do you got going on?

37:47.824 --> 37:50.324
Some kind of pass-worker scam?

37:50.359 --> 37:52.994
How did you... scrub
your arrest records?

37:53.029 --> 37:54.795
I'm not a pass-worker. I'm a suit,

37:54.831 --> 37:58.666
- and I can't have you coming...
- You're a what?

37:58.701 --> 38:02.402
Wait... That was your back door?

38:05.808 --> 38:07.374
When you said you were
going to a better place,

38:07.409 --> 38:11.478
I thought you meant... Winnipeg.

38:13.516 --> 38:16.851
But you got over the wall.

38:16.886 --> 38:18.485
I got lucky.

38:18.521 --> 38:20.587
Yeah?

38:20.623 --> 38:22.222
Good for you.

38:22.352 --> 38:24.058
You fucking left me...

38:24.093 --> 38:25.660
In that refugee camp!

38:25.695 --> 38:28.062
The second you use an
exploit, they patch it.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.230
I didn't even know if it was gonna work.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.667
Oh, but it did.

38:33.570 --> 38:37.138
Aaron, I have a family now.

38:37.173 --> 38:41.776
If the company finds out
where I came from...

38:41.811 --> 38:45.179
Your secret's safe with me.

38:45.214 --> 38:48.115
Thank you.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.684
- If you need money...
- I don't need your money.

38:49.719 --> 38:52.286
- Or prescription drugs.
- What I need...

38:52.321 --> 38:57.191
is for you to pry open
that back door again...

38:57.226 --> 39:00.094
and let me in.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.997
You owe me that much...

39:03.032 --> 39:04.631
don't you think?

39:15.476 --> 39:18.711
You scrubbed your DNA profile
from the FEMA database?

39:18.746 --> 39:21.313
I think FEMA is like...

39:21.348 --> 39:23.248
one old lady at a desk now, but yes.

39:23.284 --> 39:25.284
And what about your arrest records?

39:25.319 --> 39:27.452
Actually, I pinned those on
a wife-beater in Walnut Hill.

39:27.488 --> 39:29.922
This isn't some reffo-camp prank.

39:29.957 --> 39:32.224
The companies... they execute people

39:32.259 --> 39:33.893
for far less than we're doing here.

39:33.928 --> 39:36.495
They call it "Termination of Contract."

39:36.530 --> 39:37.930
I'll be careful.

39:37.965 --> 39:39.699
If you wanna be safe,
you need to remember

39:39.734 --> 39:42.668
that these suits only
care about themselves.

39:42.704 --> 39:46.672
How big their houses are; what
floor their offices are on.

39:46.708 --> 39:49.675
Keep your head down,
and your dreams small,

39:49.711 --> 39:52.311
and you can almost become invisible.

39:52.346 --> 39:55.447
You're gonna have a better
life than you ever imagined.

39:55.482 --> 39:57.149
Isn't that enough?

39:57.185 --> 39:59.251
Not without Elena.

40:23.196 --> 40:25.031
MEDICAL HISTORY

40:31.152 --> 40:34.120
Go ahead. Pick your name.

40:40.844 --> 40:43.289
NAME: BENJAMIN
LAST NAME: LARSON

41:09.356 --> 41:11.056
Hey, kid.

41:11.092 --> 41:13.358
Say your name.

41:13.394 --> 41:16.595
Ben Larson.

41:16.630 --> 41:19.331
Again.

41:19.366 --> 41:21.633
Ben Larson.

41:21.669 --> 41:24.103
Again.

41:24.138 --> 41:25.637
Ben Larson.

41:29.177 --> 41:30.509
Good.

41:36.650 --> 41:39.218
After awhile...

41:39.253 --> 41:41.954
you'll think this is who
you've always been.
