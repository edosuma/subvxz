01:13.949 --> 01:16.441
Your daughter's here,
Mr. Wynant.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.448
Mr. Wynant.

01:20.539 --> 01:21.746
Mr. Wynant!

01:23.750 --> 01:26.163
Haven't you got any more sense
than to shout like that?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.494
Well, I'm sorry,
but...

01:27.588 --> 01:29.079
two weeks' work
gone for nothing!

01:29.172 --> 01:30.233
But I just wanted
to tell you...

01:30.257 --> 01:31.609
I don't care
what you wanted to tell me.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.633
Get your things!
Get out!

01:32.718 --> 01:34.175
You're through!
Get out! Get out!

01:34.261 --> 01:35.377
I'm going.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.677
Good thing
I'm going away.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.629
No peace.
No quiet.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.885
Everybody
interrupting me.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.386
Did you tell him?

01:41.476 --> 01:43.138
I didn't
get a chance.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.185
Dad!

01:45.272 --> 01:47.229
Why didn't somebody
tell me you were here?

01:47.316 --> 01:48.397
I'm sorry
to interrupt

01:48.483 --> 01:50.099
your work,
darling,

01:50.193 --> 01:51.684
but this really
is important.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.019
How are you?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.320
What,
another young man?

01:54.406 --> 01:55.442
It's the same one.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.739
It's been
the same one

01:56.825 --> 01:57.986
for three months.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.817
Forgive me.
How are you?

01:59.911 --> 02:01.868
Now take a good look
at him, dad.

02:01.955 --> 02:05.164
Try to remember him
because...

02:05.876 --> 02:07.162
He's going to be
your son-in-law.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.493
Well!

02:08.586 --> 02:10.122
If it's all right
with you.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.454
And if it isn't?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.255
He's still going to be
your son-in-law.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.379
You see how much
we have to say.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.052
But, dad,
this is really

02:18.138 --> 02:19.879
what I wanted
to talk to you about.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.965
Do you mind
if I look around?

02:22.059 --> 02:23.059
No. Help yourself.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.430
Oh, Tom, show this...
where are you going?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.182
Home.
I'm fired.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.272
Who fired you?

02:28.357 --> 02:30.019
You did.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.599
Forget it.
Forget it!

02:31.693 --> 02:33.004
Will you show
this gentleman around?

02:33.028 --> 02:34.360
Yes.
This way, sir.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.778
Thank you.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.538
Dad, mother's planning
on a big church wedding.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.691
Yes, she would.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.367
I hate all that fuss,

02:41.453 --> 02:43.490
but I'll do it
on one condition...

02:43.580 --> 02:45.867
that you're there to
give me away, darling.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.698
What would your mother
say to that?

02:47.793 --> 02:49.079
It's my wedding,
isn't it?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.081
Yes, but wouldn't it
be embarrassing

02:51.171 --> 02:52.211
to have all of us there...

02:52.255 --> 02:53.666
your mother, me,
your stepfather?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.498
He can stay home.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.083
Please, daddy,
won't you?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.169
If you think
it would be all right.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.720
Now, wait a minute.
When's it going to be?

03:01.807 --> 03:03.298
I'm leaving town tonight.

03:03.392 --> 03:04.724
Where are you going?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.097
That's a secret.
I can't even tell you.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.349
I've got an important idea
to work on.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.850
What?
A new invention?

03:10.941 --> 03:13.399
Yes. I don't want somebody
to steal it from me.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.942
We were planning
on being married

03:15.028 --> 03:16.064
right after Christmas.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.361
I'll be home
before Christmas.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.733
Is that a promise?

03:18.824 --> 03:20.736
That's a promise
I won't forget.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.738
Where's MacCaulay?
It's time I started.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.410
Oh, how's your brother?

03:24.496 --> 03:25.782
Oh, he's all right.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.615
I'd like to see him.
Why don't you bring him?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.166
You know how it is.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.914
He's sort of under
mother's thumb.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.245
Yes, I know.
I know.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.127
You're not missing much.
He's cuckoo.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.753
Like all the rest of us?

03:38.844 --> 03:40.927
Say, has this fellow...

03:41.012 --> 03:42.753
has he seen
the whole family?

03:42.848 --> 03:46.091
Yes, and he still
wants to marry me.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.550
He's a brave man.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.644
Yes.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.929
<i>Thanks
a lot, old man.</i>

03:49.980 --> 03:52.438
You certainly have an
interesting plant here.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.981
I didn't know
that you invented

03:54.067 --> 03:55.433
that smelting process,
Mr. Wynant.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.484
This is the first metal
that came through.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.155
Three kinds of ore...
gold, silver, copper.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.732
Well, isn't that
interesting?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.408
Daddy, does that
still bother you?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.951
Only
in bad weather.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.744
It isn't
bad weather now.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.948
Then you'd better
get home before it is.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.436
Good-bye, darling,
and don't forget...

04:11.460 --> 04:14.874
the 30th of December.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.295
- Good-bye, boy.
- Good-bye.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.373
Take good care
of Dorothy.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.129
Show her that
there is such a thing

04:20.218 --> 04:21.504
as a happy marriage.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.257
I'll do my best.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.462
Good-bye.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.047
Is it all settled?

04:26.141 --> 04:28.724
Grand! Say, why did
your mother divorce him?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.051
I think he's swell.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.511
It seems he has
a secretary.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.268
Oh! Well, I'll do
my own typing.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.644
Ooh! Dad's
a good barometer.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.274
Here's a taxi.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.239
Hello, Mr. MacCaulay.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.787
How are you?
Get under this.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.239
No.
We're taking your cab.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.790
Your father
still in there?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.242
Yes. He's
waiting for you.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.872
Did he tell
where he's going?

04:55.962 --> 04:57.169
Wouldn't say.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.042
Well, good-bye,
Miss Wynant.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.714
Here's your change,
boss.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.963
You wouldn't drive slowly,
so no tip.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.466
That's ok, sweetheart.
I got it anyway.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.513
Oh, Mr. Wynant.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.314
Hello there.
Did you get my money?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.608
I do wish you'd tell me
where you're going.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.810
I'm not telling anyone.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.361
Suppose some business
should come up.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.359
That's just why
I'm going.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.987
There's 100, 200, 300...

05:27.077 --> 05:28.534
oh, here.
Never mind.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.283
I wish you'd count it.
There's $1,000 there.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.705
I trust you.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.703
Isn't there anything else
I can do?

05:34.793 --> 05:36.125
Have you bought
your ticket?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.211
No.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.254
Let me do that.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.545
Yeah,
you might do that.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.089
You might get me
a ticket for...

05:42.175 --> 05:44.883
No, you don't.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.552
Thanks and good-bye.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.470
What will I do
if something comes up?

05:48.557 --> 05:50.844
Settle it yourself.
What have I got a lawyer for?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.141
Is Julia going
with you?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.227
No.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.431
What if you need
more money?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.832
I've left instructions
with Julia.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.813
She'll get it from you.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.390
You don't tell me
a thing.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.146
I don't know
where you're going,

06:01.236 --> 06:03.148
when you're coming back,

06:03.238 --> 06:06.731
or how to reach you
if any business comes up!

06:16.251 --> 06:17.251
Hello, Tanner.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.746
Mr. Wynant.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.920
My daughter's going
to be married, Tanner.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.670
Nice young man.
She just brought him in.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.672
Well, congratulations.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.346
I'm going to make her
a wedding present.

06:30.432 --> 06:34.893
Thought I'd better do it
now before I forget it.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.311
I can drop them
on the way...

06:41.568 --> 06:42.775
that's funny.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.654
Where are those bonds?

06:46.740 --> 06:47.821
Bonds, sir?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.240
I know I put them
in there.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.784
Maybe Miss Wolf
has them, sir.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.112
Yes...

06:54.205 --> 06:55.946
Maybe she has.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.658
<i>Joe, how do
you like yours?</i>

06:58.752 --> 06:59.913
Straight.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.424
You women sure take
a lot of punishment.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.763
You're in the wrong
place, buddy.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.064
Am I?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.607
What do you want?

07:23.693 --> 07:24.979
Who is it, Joe?

07:25.070 --> 07:27.403
That's what
I want to know.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.564
We're just having
a little drink.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.820
Yes, so I see.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.026
Well...

07:34.871 --> 07:36.533
See you later, Joe.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.831
Didn't know I was
talking to the boyfriend.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.703
<i>So long.</i>

07:43.797 --> 07:45.379
So long, Joe.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.374
Who's that man?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.584
He isn't anybody,

07:49.678 --> 07:51.385
just a fellow
I used to know.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.679
I thought you'd given up
that sort of friend.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.973
It's the first time
I've seen him in years.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.016
Didn't want him to think
I was high-hatting him.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.265
You know how I feel
about that sort of thing.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.814
Don't worry.
You won't see him again.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.267
Tell me, did you change
your mind about going?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.819
No. I just came back
for a second.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.192
I want to get those...
Bonds.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.324
Bonds?

08:15.078 --> 08:16.239
What bonds?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.490
<i>The government bonds,</i>

08:17.580 --> 08:20.448
<i>the ones you took
from the office safe.</i>

08:20.542 --> 08:22.625
Oh, yes.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.703
You told me to sell
those a long time ago.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.503
I'd never tell you
to sell those.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.046
I bought those
for my daughter.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.214
<i>But don't you
remember...</i>

08:29.300 --> 08:30.711
now, see here, Julia,

08:30.802 --> 08:33.840
you're counting too much
on my absent-mindedness.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.547
You've been taking a little
here and there for some time

08:36.640 --> 08:38.724
without my saying
anything about it,

08:38.809 --> 08:41.177
but this is $50,000.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.416
Do you realize you're
accusing me of...

08:43.440 --> 08:45.648
no one else had the
combination to that safe.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.942
You took them.
What did you do with them?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.485
What if I did take them?

08:49.571 --> 08:51.278
I'm sick
of seeing you hand out

08:51.364 --> 08:53.606
thousands of dollars
to your family,

08:53.700 --> 08:54.907
supporting
a gang of loafers

08:54.993 --> 08:56.825
that don't care
a darn about you,

08:56.911 --> 08:58.243
a wife that kicked you out

08:58.329 --> 08:59.598
the first time
your foot slipped.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.204
Not one would help,

09:01.291 --> 09:03.248
and I've given
my whole life to you.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.291
If you kicked off tomorrow,
where would I be?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.494
Out in the gutter.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.875
Who has a better right?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.423
I want that money, or I'll
hand you over to the police.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.546
Go ahead.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.800
They'll be pretty rough
with you... With your record.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.347
<i>That's a fine thing
to say</i>

09:18.433 --> 09:19.890
<i>after what
I've been to you.</i>

09:19.976 --> 09:21.592
Hello. Give me...

09:25.982 --> 09:27.393
well?

09:31.321 --> 09:34.780
All right.
I'll give it to you.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.482
25,000...
that's all I've got.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.317
You're going to return
every cent of it.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.902
I can't.
I haven't got it.

09:39.996 --> 09:40.996
What'd you do
with it?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.081
I never had it.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.499
Then there was someone
in with you. Who was it?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.915
I'll answer that.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.005
Hello.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.090
<i>Hello.</i>

09:51.174 --> 09:52.381
<i>Hello!</i>

09:55.553 --> 09:57.385
Hello!

10:06.272 --> 10:08.810
You don't need
to tell me.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.768
I have
a pretty good idea.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.482
What are you
going to do?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.690
Stop worrying
about your father.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.146
He'll turn up
all right.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.197
Yes, but, Tommy,
today's Christmas Eve.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.365
He's just forgotten.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.238
You know how he
forgets everything.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.490
No. He never forgets
a promise to me.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.244
I'm worried, Tommy. I know
something's happened to him.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.949
What could happen
to him, darling?

11:09.043 --> 11:11.251
Now, will you
stop worrying?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.262
You see, the important
thing is the rhythm.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.261
You must always have
rhythm in your shaking.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.968
Now, a Manhattan you
shake to fox-trot time,

11:28.062 --> 11:30.896
a Bronx to two-step
time.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.473
The dry Martini

11:32.567 --> 11:34.900
you always shake
to waltz time.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.245
Oh!

11:48.374 --> 11:49.535
Mmm!

11:49.626 --> 11:51.242
- What is it?
- Just a minute.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.337
Now, mind you,

11:53.421 --> 11:54.940
there's a still more
modern trend in...

11:54.964 --> 11:57.627
here. Let me have...
thank you.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.253
Certain people...

12:00.178 --> 12:01.178
hello there.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.378
Hello.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.634
Another glass.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.840
How are you?

12:05.934 --> 12:07.266
You know,
we <i>do</i> know each other.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.639
Well, of course we do. We've
known each other for years.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.516
Aren't you
Nick Charles?

12:11.606 --> 12:12.606
Yes.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.273
You don't remember me.
I'm Dorothy Wynant.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.101
Not that scrawny
little bit of...

12:17.195 --> 12:18.402
yes.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.275
How did you ever
remember me?

12:20.365 --> 12:23.278
You used to fascinate me...
a real, live detective.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.137
You used to tell me
the most wonderful stories.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.161
Were they true?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.987
Probably not.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.663
Tommy, this is
Nick Charles.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.741
Hi, Tommy.
Have another glass.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.791
He worked once
on a case for my father.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.915
Yeah. Some nut
wanted to kill him.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.005
How is your father?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.753
That's what I came to ask
you. He's disappeared.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.424
Don't say that,
darling.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.002
He's just away
somewhere working.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.803
I can't find him.
I've tried everything.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.050
I thought
you might know.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.140
I don't know anything.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.342
I've been in California
for the last four years.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.676
What about
his lawyer?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.727
Used to be some bird
by the name of Mac, uh...

12:52.814 --> 12:53.814
Oh, MacCaulay?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.184
Herbert MacCaulay.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.686
I tried him once.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.812
Try him again.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.063
Here's a Nickel.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.645
Thank you.
I'll be right back.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.195
You know, she's got
me worrying, too.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.992
Oh, you mustn't
worry about him.

13:07.078 --> 13:10.321
Mind you, he's
a great guy but screwy.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.872
<i>Madam,
I'm very sorry,</i>

13:11.958 --> 13:14.166
<i>but no dog...</i>

13:14.252 --> 13:15.252
Asta!

13:15.336 --> 13:17.749
I'm sorry, madam.
No dogs allowed.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.796
You cannot take
the dog in there.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.623
I'm not taking him.
He's taking me.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.380
Oh!

13:23.469 --> 13:24.960
Are you hurt, madam?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.013
No. Women and children
first, boys.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.011
What is the score
anyway?

13:30.101 --> 13:32.593
Oh, so it's <i>you</i>
he was after.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.144
Hello, sugar.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.222
He's dragged me into
every gin mill on the block.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.228
I had him out
this morning.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.650
I thought so.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.443
This is Tommy.
My wife.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.940
How are you,
Tommy?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.567
Tommy, I don't usually
look like this.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.777
I've been
Christmas shopping.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.782
Madam,
we shall take the dog out.

13:47.869 --> 13:48.869
It's all right.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.787
It's my dog...
And my wife.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.081
You might have mentioned
me first on the billing.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.328
The dog's
well-trained.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.418
He'll behave
himself.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.747
He might
bite somebody.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.580
He's all right.
Look. Lie down.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.414
Lie down.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.460
Stand up.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.512
See?

14:07.597 --> 14:08.838
Any luck?

14:08.931 --> 14:09.992
Yes.
He's just around the corner.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.016
Your father?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.932
No. MacCaulay.
I'm just going to go see him.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.931
Oh, uh, my wife.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.137
This is
Dorothy Wynant.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.892
I'm sorry
we have to rush.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.668
We're stopping in the normandie
for a couple weeks.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.853
Drop around. See us.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.311
We'd love to.
Thank you. Good-bye.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.691
Sit down,
sugar.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.318
Oh, Leo,
uh...

14:27.408 --> 14:28.524
Yes, sir.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.154
Two cocktails.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.324
Pretty girl.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.701
Yes. She's
a very nice type.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.328
You got types?

14:37.418 --> 14:38.704
Only you, darling...

14:38.795 --> 14:41.333
lanky brunettes
with wicked jaws.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.914
Leo.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.590
Compliments
of the season.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.212
Who is she?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.589
Oh, darling,
I was hoping

14:48.679 --> 14:50.341
I wouldn't
have to answer that.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.967
Come on.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.096
Well, Dorothy is
really my daughter.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.223
You see, it was
spring in venice,

14:57.313 --> 14:58.520
and I was so young,

14:58.606 --> 15:00.347
I didn't know
what I was doing.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.933
We're all like that
on my father's side.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.984
By the way,
how is your father's side?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.983
It's much better,
thanks. And yours?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.985
How many drinks
have you had?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.533
This will make
six martinis.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.612
All right. Will you bring me
five more martinis, Leo?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.162
And line them
right up here.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.249
Yes, ma'am.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.414
Hmm...

15:26.676 --> 15:28.212
What hit me?

15:28.302 --> 15:30.840
The last Martini.
How about a pick-me-up?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.796
No!

15:34.267 --> 15:35.633
I can't lie here.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.933
I've got to get up

15:37.019 --> 15:40.353
and trim that darn
Christmas tree.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.056
What's the idea
of pushing me?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.521
Who's that?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.694
It's probably
Santa claus.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.905
Hello, MacCaulay!
Come in.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.611
Dorothy told me
you were here.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.196
I was going to
telephone, but...

15:57.290 --> 15:59.407
that's all right.
Sit down, won't you?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
What are you drinking?

16:00.585 --> 16:01.826
Oh, nothing. Thanks.
Nothing.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.126
Oh, that's
a mistake.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.748
I wanted to see you.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.956
What's Mimi up to,
Mr. Charles?

16:07.049 --> 16:10.918
Dorothy's mother? Does she have
to be up to something?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.093
She usually is...

16:12.180 --> 16:14.797
trying one way or another
to get money out of Wynant.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.975
I wanted to find out
if you were, uh...

16:18.060 --> 16:19.847
Sleuthing for her.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.099
I haven't been
a detective in four years.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.307
My wife's father died
and left her

16:24.400 --> 16:28.485
a narrow-Gauge railway,
lumbermill, and, uh...

16:28.571 --> 16:30.107
Oh, several
other things.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.689
I'm taking care
of them.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.819
What's the fuss about?
Is he in hiding?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.651
You know as much
about it as I do.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.532
I haven't seen him
in three months.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.284
No word at all?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.330
He sends word through
his secretary Julia Wolf

16:41.417 --> 16:42.417
when he wants money.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.915
I give it to her,
and she gives it to him.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.121
That's still on, huh?

16:48.591 --> 16:50.127
Excuse me.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.130
<i>Hello?</i>

16:52.220 --> 16:53.631
<i>Oh, just a minute.</i>

16:53.721 --> 16:54.882
For you.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.089
Is there a Mr. MacCaulay
in the house?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.175
Oh. Oh, pardon me.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.885
<i>Yes?
Oh, just a moment.</i>

17:01.979 --> 17:03.220
My wife.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.931
How do you do?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.142
Yes? What were
you saying?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.068
He is?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.396
Well, where
is he now?

17:12.490 --> 17:15.153
Oh, very well.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.950
Oh, excuse us.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.904
He's back in town...
Wynant.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.204
Wynant?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.781
Yes. He's waiting
for me now.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.036
Forgive me,
Mrs. Charles,

17:24.126 --> 17:25.867
but I've
been so upset.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.169
You know,
it's no joke

17:27.255 --> 17:29.292
working for a man
like that.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.294
Well, I guess
I'd better be off.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.843
Good-bye.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.841
Merry Christmas.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.218
Same to you.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.265
Next person that says
"merry Christmas" to me,

17:41.352 --> 17:42.718
I'll kill them.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.519
I'm going to telephone
that poor child.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.473
At least she'll be glad
to know he's alive.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.226
Asta!

17:59.412 --> 18:01.324
Hello?

18:01.414 --> 18:05.658
Oh! How <i>are</i> you?

18:05.751 --> 18:08.038
Oh, I'm
Mrs. Jorgenson now.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.870
Dorothy?
No, she isn't here.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.421
Is it something
about her father?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.339
Perhaps I can take
the message.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.464
Oh, uh...
Here she is now.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.011
Hello?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.339
I just wanted
to relieve your mind.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.345
He's alive,
and he's all right.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.051
Oh, thank goodness.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.852
What is it?
Has he found him?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.804
Do you know
where he's living?

18:27.898 --> 18:31.517
Oh. Well, at least
I'm glad he's all right.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.819
Thank you for calling.
Good-bye.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.566
What is it?
What is it?

18:35.656 --> 18:36.817
Nothing.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.115
It's something about
your father. Where is he?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.408
He's fine.
Isn't that enough?

18:40.494 --> 18:41.494
No!

18:41.579 --> 18:43.866
You want money,
you haven't any right to.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.288
He made
a big settlement on you.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.287
That's gone long ago.
Where is he?

18:48.377 --> 18:50.790
Mother, I won't have you
hounding him for more money.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.961
I can tell you,
mother.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.710
<i>You've been listening
on tha t extension.</i>

18:53.799 --> 18:55.961
Of course.
What's an extension for?

18:56.052 --> 18:59.136
That's right, Gilbert.
What did he say?

18:59.221 --> 19:00.381
He said that
father's in town.

19:00.431 --> 19:01.797
He's been seeing Julia
right along.

19:01.891 --> 19:02.891
That woman!

19:02.975 --> 19:04.036
She can tell you
where father is.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.722
Mother,
you wouldn't.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.927
I didn't
say I would,

19:07.021 --> 19:08.887
but we've got
to have money.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.189
Did it ever occur to you
that Chris might work?

19:11.275 --> 19:12.516
Shh!

19:18.407 --> 19:20.319
Oh!

19:20.409 --> 19:22.321
Now you've hurt
his feelings!

19:24.121 --> 19:25.121
Chris?

19:25.206 --> 19:28.244
You have an oedipus complex,
and you won't admit it.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.370
Please, Gilbert.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.668
The trouble with you is
you won't face facts.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.461
I know I have
a mother fixation,

19:33.547 --> 19:35.630
but it's slight. It hasn't
yet reached the point...

19:35.716 --> 19:37.924
stop it, Gilbert.
Stop it.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.212
Don't mind
what she says, Chris.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.798
How can I help but mind?
I'm constantly humiliated

19:44.892 --> 19:46.012
just because
I haven't money.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.352
I'll get some.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.302
Yes. You've said
that for weeks.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.309
Why don't you see Julia?
She handles his money.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.606
Chris!

19:52.692 --> 19:53.853
All right,
all right.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.400
I couldn't go near
that woman!

19:55.486 --> 19:56.852
I said all right.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.278
What are you
going to do?

19:58.364 --> 19:59.364
What I said I'd do.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.609
You wouldn't!

20:00.700 --> 20:03.238
Wouldn't I?
Just watch me.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.863
Oh, Chris!

20:04.954 --> 20:06.286
Chris!

20:07.123 --> 20:09.661
Chris!

20:28.561 --> 20:29.561
Get me Miss Wolf

20:29.645 --> 20:31.728
<i>at the clarkston
apartments.</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:34.848
Hello... Miss Wolf?

20:34.942 --> 20:36.808
Uh, this is
Mrs. Jorgenson.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.894
<i>I wonder
if I may see you.</i>

20:38.988 --> 20:40.149
Yes, of course.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.446
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:50.666 --> 20:52.102
Miss Wolf's
apartment, please.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.743
9a. Who's
calling, please?

20:54.837 --> 20:58.501
<i>Never mind. Miss Wolf
is expecting me.</i>

21:23.574 --> 21:25.156
Miss Wolf?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.697
Miss Wolf!

21:41.634 --> 21:42.795
Aah!

22:20.840 --> 22:22.376
Quick! Quick!

22:22.466 --> 22:23.923
Send somebody
up here right away.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.251
Something terrible
has happened!

22:26.345 --> 22:28.962
Julia Wolf.
145 west 55th street.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.422
That's me.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.597
What is it?

22:31.684 --> 22:32.765
Woman murdered.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.974
Where you been?

22:41.068 --> 22:42.275
Out making money.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.477
Let's see it.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.403
I haven't
got it yet,

22:45.489 --> 22:46.821
but I'll get it.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.493
<i>Come on. Give out,
girls. Give out.</i>

22:52.580 --> 22:53.866
<i>Shake the bodies
a little.</i>

22:53.956 --> 22:55.037
<i>Get the rhythm.</i>

22:59.211 --> 23:00.793
<i>Keep it up.
I can't hear any rhythm.</i>

23:00.880 --> 23:02.496
<i>Come on.
Shake your feet.</i>

23:02.590 --> 23:03.797
Hello, morelli.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.795
Hiya, stutsy.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.751
Hey, uh...

23:07.845 --> 23:09.256
Didn't you know
Julia Wolf?

23:11.390 --> 23:12.506
Yeah.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.091
Why?

23:14.685 --> 23:16.768
Somebody just
bumped her off.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.597
I thought maybe
you'd like to know.

23:21.609 --> 23:22.609
Yes?

23:22.693 --> 23:23.962
<i>Telephone, Mr. MacCaulay.</i>

23:23.986 --> 23:25.067
Who is it?

23:25.154 --> 23:27.692
<i>The police.</i>

23:27.781 --> 23:28.942
Hello?

23:30.326 --> 23:32.659
Murdered?

23:32.745 --> 23:35.909
Yes. Yes, I'll
be right over.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.114
What you gonna
tell them?

23:37.207 --> 23:39.199
I'm gonna tell them
everything.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.829
You don't think
Mr. Wynant...

23:40.920 --> 23:42.411
I don't think anything,

23:42.504 --> 23:44.496
but I heard a fight
a while ago!

23:44.590 --> 23:45.590
All right, girls.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.666
Oh, yes. Come on.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.405
When was the last time you
gave her money for Wynant?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.466
Yesterday.
I gave her $1,000.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.763
Any signs
of that, bill?

23:53.849 --> 23:55.215
No. Perhaps it
was a robbery.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.347
Her with that sparkler on her
finger and $30 in her purse?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.429
It looks like
Wynant came to collect

24:00.522 --> 24:02.229
and ran into
a little trouble.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.273
Downstairs they haven't
seen him in three months.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.568
There's a lot of things
they don't see here.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.646
You haven't heard
from him in that time?

24:08.739 --> 24:09.855
He hadn't
written me.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.406
Then you have
heard from him.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.983
He telephoned me
today.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.034
I wasn't in. My secretary
took the message.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.827
He wanted
to meet at the Plaza.

24:16.914 --> 24:17.914
What time?

24:17.957 --> 24:18.957
About 3:00.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
Did you go?

24:20.084 --> 24:21.996
Yes.
He didn't show.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.123
His house and shop
is closed,

24:24.213 --> 24:25.875
and he ain't
at any hotel.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.548
So you seen your duty,
and you done it, huh?

24:28.634 --> 24:30.626
You gonna stop at that?

24:31.929 --> 24:33.090
No, sir.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.672
He'll turn up when he
sees this in the papers.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.509
You can't think he had
anything to do with it.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.345
You know what they fought about
that night he went away?

24:41.438 --> 24:43.600
I didn't know
they had a fight.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.398
Well, thanks.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.271
We'll get in touch
when we need you.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.361
I may go?

24:48.445 --> 24:49.936
Yeah, go ahead.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.568
Mr. Guild,
come here.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.445
Here's something
very interesting.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.776
Hmm...

24:56.870 --> 24:59.237
And there she was,
lying on the floor dead.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.867
The police said that
she'd been killed

25:00.958 --> 25:02.227
about 10 minutes
before I got there.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.834
I thought you said
you weren't going there.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.252
Did they
find any clues?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.954
A gun, fingerprints?

25:08.048 --> 25:09.209
Not a thing.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.506
Was there
much blood?

25:10.592 --> 25:11.753
Gilbert, don't be
so horrible!

25:11.844 --> 25:13.881
Nonsense. She got
what she deserved.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.587
Did you kill her?

25:15.681 --> 25:17.593
You had a perfectly
good motive.

25:17.683 --> 25:18.683
Don't talk like that

25:18.767 --> 25:20.349
when
the police get here.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.893
You said they'd
finished with you.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.265
They'd finished
for the present.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.348
I've got my alibi.
I was at the library.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.442
Where were you?

25:27.526 --> 25:30.519
Children, I want to
speak to Chris alone.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.983
Well, I'll go.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.359
I'll be in my room.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.196
Is Mrs. Jorgenson in?

25:38.287 --> 25:40.995
Yes. Come right in.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.322
Oh, Mrs. Jorgenson,

25:42.416 --> 25:44.373
a few points
I'd like to clear up.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.203
Why, yes. Yes.
Won't you sit down?

25:47.296 --> 25:49.663
Thank you.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.385
You were in the room
with the body

25:56.472 --> 25:58.634
from the time it was
discovered until we came?

25:58.724 --> 25:59.724
Why, yes.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.845
Did you, uh...

26:01.935 --> 26:03.927
Did you see anything
in Miss Wolf's hand?

26:04.021 --> 26:05.557
Oh, no.

26:05.647 --> 26:08.685
Are you sure that at
no time you left the room,

26:08.776 --> 26:11.268
that a maid or bellboy
might have slipped in there

26:11.361 --> 26:12.602
and been alone
with the body?

26:12.696 --> 26:14.153
I don't think so.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.239
I was so upset,

26:15.324 --> 26:18.192
I hardly knew
what I was doing.

26:18.285 --> 26:21.824
The medical examiner
seems to think that, uh...

26:21.914 --> 26:23.826
That the body
had been touched,

26:23.916 --> 26:26.033
that someone had forced
open the girl's hand

26:26.126 --> 26:27.662
after she'd been killed.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.961
Moreover, we found that
she had in her possession

26:30.047 --> 26:32.915
$1,000 the night before.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.715
I'm sorry
I can't help you.

26:34.802 --> 26:35.883
Hmm...

26:35.969 --> 26:37.881
Well, that's
quite all right.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.304
We'll be going along.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.471
Thank you.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.675
Good-bye.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.147
Could I
see the body?

26:49.233 --> 26:50.474
I've never seen
a dead body.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.808
Why do you want to?

26:51.902 --> 26:53.622
I've been studying
psychopathic criminology,

26:53.695 --> 26:55.061
and I have a theory.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.362
Perhaps this was the work

26:56.448 --> 26:58.110
of a sadist
or a paranoiac.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.943
If I saw it, I might
be able to tell.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.777
That's a good idea,

27:02.871 --> 27:04.658
but don't bother
to come down.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.705
We'll bring the body
right up to you.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.140
What have you
got there?

27:24.226 --> 27:25.433
None of your business.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.181
You took that money
from her hand.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.271
I didn't.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.812
What are you hiding?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.890
Evidence that's worth
a great deal.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.104
Hand that over
to the police.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.650
I'll do nothing
of the sort.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.227
Very well. I will.

27:36.321 --> 27:39.359
I don't think you will.
It's your father's.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.863
I don't believe you.
You're lying!

27:42.953 --> 27:44.239
There.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.076
Oh! Oh...

27:47.166 --> 27:48.623
Now will you
believe me?

27:56.592 --> 27:58.504
Ammunition?

27:58.594 --> 27:59.594
Come on, stock up.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.877
No. Let
this one ride.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.928
You'd better.
Hard times may catch you.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.472
Nick, who are
these amazing people?

28:04.558 --> 28:07.016
Just old friends. Romans,
countrymen, what do you say?

28:07.102 --> 28:09.094
This is like
old times, Nick.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.396
Remember the fun we had
when we were broke?

28:11.481 --> 28:13.188
Those were
the good old days.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.155
Don't kid yourself.
<i>These</i> are the good old days.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.153
Hey, Nick, I think
your wife is great.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.651
Thanks. I wanted
you to see her...

28:20.741 --> 28:22.653
And I wanted her
to see you.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.951
Want to buy a piece
of this pug, Nick?

28:25.037 --> 28:27.575
I'll sell you 25%
of him for 5 grand.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.872
He's been knocking them cold.
Ain't afraid of nobody.

28:29.958 --> 28:33.201
Put that down,
or I'll slug you.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.581
Having a good time?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.037
Swell.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.589
Here's that man again.
Ammunition?

28:38.675 --> 28:39.675
Thank you.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.754
You're very welcome.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.426
Thank you.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.255
Highballs and cocktails...
the long and short of it.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.385
That's a pun.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.467
The punster
should be punished.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.223
♪♪ For tomorrow
may bring sorrow ♪♪

28:51.313 --> 28:54.977
♪♪ So tonight,
let us be gay ♪♪

28:55.067 --> 28:56.854
Another cocktail?

28:56.944 --> 28:57.944
Thank you
very much.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.111
Oh, do.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.235
I certainly think
your husband's great.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.442
Well, I'm glad
somebody does.

29:05.535 --> 29:06.535
<i>Cocktails?</i>

29:11.750 --> 29:12.866
Have a cocktail?

29:12.960 --> 29:14.576
Thanks.
Nick Charles here?

29:14.670 --> 29:16.036
- Yes.
- You're his wife?

29:16.129 --> 29:17.415
Yes. Hey, Nick!

29:17.506 --> 29:19.964
Nice guy. Sent me up
the river one time.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.050
Hello, face.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.420
Long time no see.

29:22.511 --> 29:23.547
Long time.

29:23.637 --> 29:24.798
I needed the rest.

29:24.888 --> 29:25.969
Was he
a good detective?

29:26.056 --> 29:27.056
I wouldn't know.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.974
That time he caught me
was an accident.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.847
Come on, kid.
Shed the chapeau.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.269
Divest yourself
of raiment

29:33.355 --> 29:35.312
and join
the yuletide revelers.

29:35.399 --> 29:38.187
Hey, revelers, I want you
to know face peppler.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.985
All you got to do
is find out who they are.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.899
Don't bother
to announce anyone.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.201
Just send
them all up.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.778
I know.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.328
It's all right.
They're his friends.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.517
<i>...the Julia Wolf murder.</i>

29:52.541 --> 29:55.409
<i>Police found tha t the secretary
was a gangster's girl.</i>

29:55.502 --> 29:56.813
<i>They're now looking
for the gangster.</i>

29:56.837 --> 29:59.500
<i>Clyde Wynant,
is still missing.</i>

29:59.589 --> 30:01.626
Can't you fellas think
of anything but business?

30:01.717 --> 30:03.208
Good case for you.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.635
Haven't you heard the news?
I'm a gentleman now.

30:05.721 --> 30:08.088
<i>Nick, reporters.</i>

30:08.181 --> 30:09.297
Salutations,
boys.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.348
You're just the man
I want to see.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.892
I'm from the <i>American,</i>
Mr. Charles.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.185
Give us a statement.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.228
We hear you're on
the Julia Wolf case.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.931
I don't know
anything about it.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.311
Give us a break.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.142
I never try
to kid reporters.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.443
I'm telling you
the truth.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.361
Why are you
in town?

30:24.448 --> 30:26.189
My wife's on a bender.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.195
I'm trying to
sober her up.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.117
Oh, waiter,
drinks, please.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.364
Into the kitchen,
son,

30:31.455 --> 30:32.741
and thaw out
some ice.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.948
Grandma, what large
glasses you have.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.658
Is he working
on a case?

30:36.752 --> 30:37.752
Yes, yes.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.122
What case?

30:39.212 --> 30:41.420
A case of scotch.
Pitch in and help him.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.174
Say, I've got to
order some food.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.842
Isn't it
a waste of energy?

30:46.928 --> 30:50.092
That sounds like an interesting
case. Why don't you take it?

30:50.182 --> 30:52.515
I haven't time. I'm busy
seeing that you don't lose

30:52.601 --> 30:53.842
the money
I married you for.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.221
Room service, please.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.598
It sounds like
a good case.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.476
A girl mysteriously murdered.
Nobody knows who did it.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.559
They haven't found any clues...
no gun, no fingerprints.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.314
I'll bet you dollars
to dog biscuits

31:04.404 --> 31:07.021
that they never
thought of...

31:07.115 --> 31:10.779
I don't want to hear
anything about it.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.656
Is that my drink
over there?

31:12.746 --> 31:14.112
What are you drinking?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.492
Rye.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.327
Yes, that's yours.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.413
Send me up a whole flock
of sandwiches.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.632
I'd like to
telephone my mother

31:26.718 --> 31:28.380
and wish her
a merry Christmas.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.711
Well, why don't you?

31:29.805 --> 31:31.717
Well, I haven't got
any Nickels.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.890
Forget the Nickels.
There you are. Go ahead.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.432
Thank you.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.519
Have a hunka?

31:36.561 --> 31:37.642
I'll have two hunkas.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.810
Attaboy.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.809
Hello. Give me
long distance.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.812
I want to talk
to San Francisco.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.651
Nick, I've
got to see you...

31:52.744 --> 31:53.744
Alone.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.369
Hello there,
beautiful.

31:55.455 --> 31:57.196
Come on.
I'll take you over here.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.828
Look what's come
to our party.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.500
Let's get away
from the wolves.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.997
Who's the little
brunette?

32:03.088 --> 32:04.454
I used to bounce her
on my knee.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.835
Which knee?
Can I touch it?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.918
Well, baby,
what's on your mind?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.218
You heard
about Julia Wolf?

32:11.304 --> 32:12.304
Yeah.

32:12.389 --> 32:13.389
There.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.884
Oh, Nick! Nick,
you're hurting me.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.092
Of course. That's
what I intend to do.

32:18.145 --> 32:19.956
What are you trying to
tell me, that you did it?

32:19.980 --> 32:21.687
Yes, I killed her.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.932
Sit down.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.484
I hated her for coming
between my mother and father.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.813
She kept me
from seeing my father.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.259
I went down there
to ask her where he was,

32:31.283 --> 32:34.651
and she wouldn't tell me,
so I shot her.

32:34.744 --> 32:35.985
How many times?

32:36.079 --> 32:37.490
Once or twice.

32:37.581 --> 32:38.867
Where did you
hit her?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.914
I hit her in the...
in the heart.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.287
What did she do?

32:42.377 --> 32:43.913
She fell over.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.211
Did she scream?

32:45.297 --> 32:46.297
Yes.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.381
Which way
did she fall?

32:47.466 --> 32:49.833
She fell over
backwards.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.633
Whom are you
trying to protect?

32:51.720 --> 32:52.720
Oh, Nick, I...

32:52.762 --> 32:54.219
now wait a minute.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.172
She was shot four times.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.473
She couldn't have
screamed

32:57.559 --> 32:59.300
because she
was killed instantly.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.135
Who do you think did it?

33:01.229 --> 33:02.640
I don't know.

33:02.731 --> 33:03.938
Where did you
get this?

33:04.024 --> 33:05.481
I bought it
in a pawnshop.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.567
Another lie?

33:06.651 --> 33:08.358
No, Nick.
That's the truth.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.357
Oh, Nick.

33:20.707 --> 33:21.823
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.158
Don't be silly.
Take this.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.251
No, thank you.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.497
Want to powder
your nose?

33:25.587 --> 33:26.703
Everything's
over there.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.412
Where did you
get that?

33:28.507 --> 33:31.375
She brought it, to make me
believe that she did it.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.879
What are you going
to do with it?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.835
Nothing, till I find out
if it's the gun

33:34.930 --> 33:37.764
that Julia Wolf
was killed with.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.715
Don't let the reporters
get to her.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.766
They may believe her.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.264
Say, isn't that
Dorothy Wynant?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.392
Yes. Wait a minute.

33:45.482 --> 33:46.751
She doesn't know
anything about it.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.357
And you said you
weren't on the case.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.443
I'm not.

33:49.486 --> 33:50.977
Hello! Hello, ma!

33:51.071 --> 33:52.312
Here. Give me that,
will you?

33:52.405 --> 33:54.943
Wait. It's San Francisco.
Hiya, ma!

33:55.033 --> 33:56.990
Ma, get off the wire.
I want to talk business.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.034
Operator, give me
dry dock 4-8000.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.112
Hey! Hey! Don't do that.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.517
Don't tell your paper
I'm working on anything,

34:02.541 --> 34:03.782
because I'm not.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.491
He's working on
that little girl.

34:07.796 --> 34:08.795
Welcome to...

34:08.838 --> 34:10.079
oh, Nick! Nick!

34:10.172 --> 34:11.380
Mimi! Well,
for the love...

34:11.466 --> 34:13.422
I want to talk to you about
something.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.001
I know.
It's a convention.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.463
You got your roller skates on?
Let's get rolling.

34:18.556 --> 34:22.266
I'll take you right, uh...
No. Here, let's, uh...

34:22.351 --> 34:25.971
If you don't mind, we'll...
Let's just step in here.

34:26.606 --> 34:27.766
Well!

34:27.857 --> 34:30.018
I'm sorry, but it's the
only place we can be alone.

34:30.110 --> 34:33.274
Won't you, uh...
Sit down?

34:33.362 --> 34:35.605
Why, hello,
Mr. Wynant.

34:35.699 --> 34:36.735
Come in
and have a drink.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.315
I don't drink.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.527
I tell you Clyde Wynant is
absolutely crazy to stay away.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.329
The police think he has
something to do with it.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.416
What do you think?

34:45.500 --> 34:47.867
I know that he hasn't,
but I want to see him.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.248
There's something important
I want to tell him.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.456
MacCaulay won't help a bit.
He thinks I just want money.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.085
Don't you?

34:55.176 --> 34:56.882
Oh, you're
always teasing.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.677
I beg your pardon.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.379
We're just chatting.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.216
Nick, you will help me
find Clyde, won't you?

35:03.310 --> 35:05.518
Mimi, there are a thousand
detectives in New York.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.970
Why don't you
hire one?

35:07.063 --> 35:09.771
Yes, but he knows you.
Just get in touch with him

35:09.858 --> 35:12.066
and tell him Mimi says
everything is all right

35:12.152 --> 35:14.235
but that I've
just got to see him.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.028
I don't want
any part of it.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.114
You take
Dorothy home...

35:17.198 --> 35:18.860
Dorothy?
Is she here?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.816
Yes. She's in there
with my wife.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.793
What did you tell them?
What did you tell them?

35:23.872 --> 35:25.454
Wait a minute.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.892
It's too bad you
didn't bring your whip.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.123
She didn't
tell us a thing.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.626
I was so excited,

35:30.712 --> 35:32.999
I didn't realize
what I was doing.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.546
Come on, Dorothy.
We'll go home.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.340
She doesn't
if she doesn't want to.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.292
You can stay here.
We'd love to have you.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.844
That's sweet of you.
No, thanks. I'll go.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.262
Where's Gilbert?

35:42.349 --> 35:44.557
Gilbert?
Is he here?

35:44.643 --> 35:46.851
We might as well be
living in the lobby.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.956
There's a physiological
as well as psychological angle

35:48.980 --> 35:50.687
in my father's relationship
with Julia Wolf

35:50.774 --> 35:52.231
that the police
have overlooked,

35:52.317 --> 35:54.104
I think it settles
the whole question.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.776
My father
was a sexagenarian.

35:55.862 --> 35:56.862
He was?

35:56.946 --> 35:57.946
Yes. He admitted it.

35:58.031 --> 35:59.818
A sexagenarian, eh?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.820
But we can't put
that in the paper.

36:01.910 --> 36:02.910
Well, why not?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.735
You know how
they are. Sex?

36:04.829 --> 36:07.037
Then just say
that he was 60 years old.

36:07.123 --> 36:08.330
Is that what
that means?

36:08.416 --> 36:11.454
Of course.
Hey, that's my hat.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.661
Come and get it
while it's hot.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.004
Come on.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.457
Give us a break.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.507
I swear I don't know
anything about it.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.469
Telephone, Nicky.
Telephone.

36:22.555 --> 36:25.138
Oh, I thought
it was the door.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.225
Hello?

36:26.685 --> 36:30.895
Mr. Charles, I'd like to lay
a proposition before you.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.142
Well, I can't discuss it
over the telephone,

36:33.233 --> 36:36.101
but if you'll give me
a half-hour of your time...

36:36.194 --> 36:39.562
Yeah. It's about Julia Wolf.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.904
Hello?

36:43.993 --> 36:45.700
What is it?

36:45.787 --> 36:48.746
Aw... some guy trying
to sell me insurance.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.208
Where's
Miss Wynant?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.292
Why, she's gone.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.377
Which way
did she go?

36:53.461 --> 36:54.501
She went out
the back door.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.878
You mean
the little brunette?

36:55.964 --> 36:57.796
Yes.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.590
Oh, I'm sorry,
old fellow.

37:00.677 --> 37:03.135
Thanks. I'm engaged
for this one.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.602
Wait. No.
Don't do that.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.528
I want to talk to ma.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.608
So you think you're
a fighter, eh? Ha!

37:25.702 --> 37:26.943
So what?

37:27.036 --> 37:29.198
So listen, worm!

37:38.339 --> 37:39.671
Oh, Nicky...

37:40.300 --> 37:41.757
I love you,

37:41.843 --> 37:45.052
because you know
such lovely people.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.302
Nick.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.512
Nicky.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.606
What?

37:55.690 --> 37:56.690
You asleep?

37:56.775 --> 37:57.775
Yes.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.976
Good. I want
to talk to you.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.061
Well, that's jolly.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.758
Wouldn't you like to do
a little detecting

38:03.782 --> 38:06.616
once in a while
just for fun?

38:06.701 --> 38:07.908
Can't you
get to sleep?

38:07.994 --> 38:09.280
No.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.908
Maybe if you took a drink,
it'd help you.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.285
No, thanks.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.493
Maybe it'd help
if <i>I</i> took it.

38:17.587 --> 38:20.295
Everybody says you're
a grand detective.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.043
Well, they were
kidding you.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.669
<i>I'd like to
see you work.</i>

38:24.636 --> 38:25.636
Tomorrow morning,

38:25.720 --> 38:27.520
I'll get you a whole lot
of detective stories.

38:27.597 --> 38:30.715
I know, but that girl's
in a tough spot.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.516
<i>There's nothing
I can do to help her.</i>

38:32.602 --> 38:33.718
She thinks you can.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.600
<i>Wouldn't hurt you to try.</i>

38:36.689 --> 38:39.932
Well, darling,
my guess is...

38:42.028 --> 38:43.735
Wynant killed Julia

38:43.822 --> 38:45.563
and that Dorothy
knows about it.

38:47.116 --> 38:49.904
Police will catch him
without any help from me.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.946
I think I would
like that drink.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.122
My darling.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.735
<i>I'll give you your
Christmas present now</i>

39:04.759 --> 39:06.625
<i>if you'll give me mine.</i>

39:06.719 --> 39:07.755
At breakfast.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.337
<i>Well, it's
Christmas now.</i>

39:10.098 --> 39:12.511
Uh...

39:12.600 --> 39:13.966
Breakfast.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.808
What are you
going to give me?

39:18.898 --> 39:20.139
I hope
I don't like it.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.895
You'll have to
keep them anyway

39:21.985 --> 39:23.692
because the man
at the aquarium said

39:23.778 --> 39:25.144
he wouldn't
take them back.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.815
Did you hear
a knock?

39:29.909 --> 39:31.741
Yes.

39:31.828 --> 39:34.616
Well, it might be
something important.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.992
Well, sure, it is.

39:45.967 --> 39:46.967
Mr. Charles here?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.167
Yes.

39:48.261 --> 39:50.093
I got to talk to him.
That's all.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.841
All right.
Come in.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.047
You wait here.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.599
I'll tell him
you're here.

39:59.772 --> 40:00.888
What in
the name of...

40:00.982 --> 40:03.065
someone to see you,
dear.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.859
Good. I was afraid I was
about to go to sleep.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.902
Get out of bed.
Let me straighten this.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.072
You're worse
than an infant.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.486
Funny. I think
those blankets

40:12.577 --> 40:14.489
must be
a little cockeyed.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.070
Right, asta?

40:22.962 --> 40:23.962
<i>There.</i>

40:25.381 --> 40:26.981
You've got the funniest
look on your face

40:27.008 --> 40:28.008
I ever saw in my life.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.425
Hurry up. That man's
waiting for you.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.004
I want you to
tell me something.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.556
Give it to me straight.
Get me?

40:36.643 --> 40:38.851
Would you mind
putting that gun away?

40:38.937 --> 40:41.554
My wife doesn't care,
but I'm a timid fellow.

40:41.648 --> 40:42.764
You idiot.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.308
<i>Asta! Asta,
come here.</i>

40:45.401 --> 40:47.609
All right, shoot...
I mean, uh...

40:47.695 --> 40:49.687
What's on your mind?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.258
You don't have to
tell me you're tough.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.239
I heard about you.
I'm Joe morelli.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.658
I never heard about you.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.451
I didn't knock
Julia off.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.823
All right, you didn't.

40:57.914 --> 41:00.531
I ain't seen her in three
months. We was all washed up.

41:00.625 --> 41:01.661
Well, why tell me?

41:01.751 --> 41:04.243
I wouldn't have any reason to
hurt her.

41:04.337 --> 41:06.545
But that dirty little nunheim
got sore with her

41:06.631 --> 41:08.088
because I clicked
and he didn't,

41:08.174 --> 41:09.506
and he put
the finger on me.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.584
This is all swell, brother,

41:11.678 --> 41:14.842
but you're peddling your
fish in the wrong market.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.888
Stutsy Burke says
you used to be ok.

41:16.975 --> 41:17.975
That's why I'm here.

41:18.059 --> 41:21.018
How is stutsy? I didn't know
he was out of stir.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.891
He's all right.
He'd like to see you.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.189
What's the law doing?
Do they think I did it?

41:25.274 --> 41:27.186
Or is it just something else
to pin on me?

41:27.276 --> 41:28.767
If I knew,
I'd tell you.

41:28.861 --> 41:31.228
I don't know anything.
Ask the police.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.860
That would be the smartest
thing I ever did...

41:33.950 --> 41:36.158
the police captain's
been in the hospital 3 weeks

41:36.244 --> 41:37.530
on account of
we had an argument.

41:37.620 --> 41:42.206
The boys would like that
down to their blackjacks.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.998
Stutsy says
you're on the level.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.826
Why don't you be
on the level?

41:45.920 --> 41:48.207
I am on the level.
If I knew anything...

41:48.297 --> 41:49.297
what's that?

41:49.382 --> 41:51.840
I don't know. That
makes this your party.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.167
<i>Open up! Police!</i>

41:53.261 --> 41:54.547
Why, you
two-timing...

42:06.065 --> 42:07.476
Take him, Bob.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.934
Nora.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.145
Nora. Say, give me
that bottle, will you?

42:12.238 --> 42:13.445
What knocked her out?

42:13.531 --> 42:15.193
I did. She was
in the line of fire.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.320
Somebody call
a doctor, will you?

42:17.410 --> 42:20.403
Here, baby.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.282
Help me up
on the bed with her.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.241
Are you all right?

42:26.335 --> 42:28.372
You darn fool! You didn't
have to knock me out.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.580
I knew you'd take him.
I wanted to see you do it.

42:30.673 --> 42:33.290
There's a girl
with hair on her chest.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.343
Nicky, are you hurt?

42:36.429 --> 42:37.636
No. He just
grazed me.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.588
You are!
Somebody get a doctor.

42:39.682 --> 42:40.843
There's one
called already.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.036
Get into bed.
Are you all right?

42:42.060 --> 42:43.892
Sure. I can't
even feel it.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.594
I'll get
some towels.

42:47.356 --> 42:49.063
Hmm.
Pretty close.

42:49.734 --> 42:50.815
Have a shot,
will you?

42:50.902 --> 42:52.609
Here you are,
but you'll be ok.

42:52.695 --> 42:53.902
Tough luck.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.354
Aw, shut up!

42:55.448 --> 42:56.655
Here, darling.
Use this.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.073
Baby, it's
only a scratch.

42:58.159 --> 42:59.159
Want a drink?

42:59.243 --> 43:00.905
What do you think?

43:00.995 --> 43:03.237
How did you people
happen to pop in here?

43:03.331 --> 43:06.745
We hear this is a meeting place
for the Wynant family.

43:06.834 --> 43:08.291
We figure
we'll stick around

43:08.377 --> 43:10.744
in case the old boy
himself should show up.

43:10.838 --> 43:12.454
Then we see
this bird sneak in,

43:12.548 --> 43:14.005
and we decide
to come up.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.424
Lucky for you
we did.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.547
Yes. I might not
have been shot.

43:17.637 --> 43:18.637
You know this monkey?

43:18.721 --> 43:19.948
That dirty
little rat nunheim...

43:19.972 --> 43:20.972
shut up!

43:21.057 --> 43:22.514
Is he a friend
of yours?

43:22.600 --> 43:23.807
I never saw him
before.

43:23.893 --> 43:25.179
What did he want
with you?

43:25.269 --> 43:27.977
He wanted to tell me he
didn't kill Julia Wolf.

43:28.064 --> 43:29.100
What's that to you?

43:29.190 --> 43:30.226
Nothing.

43:30.316 --> 43:32.182
What did he think
it was to you?

43:32.276 --> 43:33.312
Ask him.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.984
I'm asking you.

43:35.071 --> 43:36.983
Keep on asking.

43:37.073 --> 43:38.109
Frisk the dump.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.735
Not without
a warrant.

43:39.826 --> 43:42.694
So <i>you</i> say.
Go on, Bob.

43:42.787 --> 43:43.994
Tough, huh?

43:44.080 --> 43:46.037
Charles,
we're both of us

43:46.124 --> 43:48.161
going about this thing
in the wrong way.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.520
I don't want
to get tough with you,

43:49.544 --> 43:51.706
and I'm sure you don't
want to with me.

43:51.796 --> 43:53.583
There's one question
I want to ask.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.335
<i>Are you willing to swear
to a complaint</i>

43:55.424 --> 43:56.790
<i>for this guy's
plugging you?</i>

43:56.884 --> 43:59.171
That's another one
I can't answer now.

43:59.262 --> 44:00.548
Maybe it was
an accident.

44:03.307 --> 44:04.707
What's that man doing
in my drawers?

44:09.772 --> 44:11.138
<i>Here you are,
lieutenant.</i>

44:14.193 --> 44:16.025
You got
a pistol permit?

44:16.112 --> 44:17.112
<i>No.</i>

44:17.196 --> 44:18.528
Ever heard
of the Sullivan act?

44:18.614 --> 44:20.651
Oh, that's all right.
We're married.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.733
<i>This gun yours?</i>

44:22.827 --> 44:23.827
No.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.368
<i>Whose is it?</i>

44:25.454 --> 44:27.571
I'll have to try
to remember.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.783
Ok. We got
plenty of time.

44:30.877 --> 44:32.118
I guess I'll
have to ask you

44:32.211 --> 44:34.168
a lot more questions
than I figured.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.836
We'll come around tomorrow
when you're feeling better.

44:37.925 --> 44:39.382
All right.
Come on, boys.

44:42.263 --> 44:43.595
Say, where's asta?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.047
Asta? As...

44:49.770 --> 44:51.102
<i>asta, come here.</i>

44:52.481 --> 44:54.768
Ha! You're
a fine watchdog.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.566
He's got more sense
than you have.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.065
I'm glad you're
not on this case.

44:59.155 --> 45:01.442
On it? I'm <i>in</i> it.
They think I did it.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.400
Well, didn't you?

45:05.161 --> 45:06.618
Ah...

46:07.890 --> 46:09.426
Well...

46:09.517 --> 46:11.008
I hope you're satisfied.

46:11.477 --> 46:13.013
Huh?

46:13.104 --> 46:14.970
Where am I?

46:15.064 --> 46:17.181
You're not
in a shooting gallery.

46:17.275 --> 46:18.516
Ah, but, sugar,

46:18.609 --> 46:21.352
this is the nicest Christmas
present I've ever had.

46:21.445 --> 46:25.405
You act as it were <i>the only</i>
Christmas present you ever had.

46:25.491 --> 46:28.325
Say, where did you get
that wrist watch?

46:28.953 --> 46:30.285
It's a Christmas present.

46:30.371 --> 46:31.532
Yeah?
Who gave it to you?

46:31.622 --> 46:32.829
You did.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.492
Well, you must admit

46:36.585 --> 46:38.577
I've got pretty
good taste, haven't I?

46:38.671 --> 46:40.333
You finished with this?

46:40.423 --> 46:43.291
Yes. I know as much about
the murder as they do.

46:43.384 --> 46:44.795
Oh, I'm a hero.

46:44.885 --> 46:46.877
I was shot twice
in the <i>tribune.</i>

46:46.971 --> 46:49.839
I read where you were shot
five times in the tabloids.

46:49.932 --> 46:50.932
It's not true.

46:51.017 --> 46:53.509
He didn't come anywhere
near my tabloids.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.221
Ah! Bull's-eye.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.897
Hello? Who is it?

46:58.983 --> 47:01.066
Oh, send him right up.

47:01.694 --> 47:02.694
Who was that?

47:02.778 --> 47:04.519
Mr. MacCaulay.

47:04.613 --> 47:05.945
The Mallorys.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.898
Oh, dear. I forgot
all about them.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.449
Aren't you hot
in that?

47:09.535 --> 47:12.448
Yes, I'm stifling,
but it's so pretty.

47:12.538 --> 47:13.824
The kirbys.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.076
Is that another
Christmas present?

47:16.167 --> 47:17.374
Mm-hmm.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.667
Did I give it
to you?

47:18.753 --> 47:20.244
Yes.

47:20.338 --> 47:21.749
I'm spoiling you.

47:22.506 --> 47:25.419
Why, Nicky,
this is from Clyde Wynant.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.750
He says,
"will you take charge

47:26.844 --> 47:29.302
"of investigation
on Julia Wolf murder?

47:29.388 --> 47:30.924
Communicate
with Herbert MacCaulay."

47:31.015 --> 47:32.927
Let me see.
Where's it from?

47:33.017 --> 47:35.680
Philadelphia.
Then he didn't do it.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.227
I don't know.

47:37.313 --> 47:38.599
He wouldn't ask you
to handle it

47:38.689 --> 47:39.770
if he were guilty,
would he?

47:42.234 --> 47:44.191
Your guess is
as good as mine, baby.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.940
Aw, Nicky,
take the case.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.692
You take it.
I'm too busy.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.200
How do you do?
Come in.

47:50.284 --> 47:51.616
Good morning.
Well, I'm afraid

47:51.702 --> 47:53.785
this isn't a very
merry Christmas for you.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.737
Oh,
he's all right.

47:55.831 --> 47:57.538
How are you,
MacCaulay?

47:57.625 --> 48:00.459
Oh, I'm fine. You're coming
along better than I am.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.285
I hope you're
not seriously hurt.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.292
No. Just a scratch.
I've forgotten it.

48:04.382 --> 48:05.918
What
a delightful toy.

48:06.008 --> 48:08.000
That's asta's
Christmas present.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.961
I got word from Wynant
this morning.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.593
So did we...
I mean, Sherlock here.

48:13.682 --> 48:14.968
Darling,
will you, uh...

48:15.059 --> 48:16.470
Pass you your drink?
Yes.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.892
Hmm.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.062
Thank you.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.502
What are the chances
of getting you

48:23.526 --> 48:24.892
to do what he wants?

48:24.985 --> 48:25.985
Slim.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.231
Would it help any

48:27.321 --> 48:29.563
if I could persuade
him to meet you?

48:29.657 --> 48:30.773
It might.

48:30.866 --> 48:33.233
He gave me a code message
to insert in the <i>times</i>

48:33.327 --> 48:34.989
in case I wanted
to get in touch.

48:35.079 --> 48:37.366
I don't suppose it would
do any harm to put it in.

48:37.456 --> 48:40.073
I've done that already.
He should appear.

48:40.167 --> 48:41.167
Hello?

48:41.252 --> 48:43.835
It doesn't look well,
his staying away now.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.037
Police.

48:45.131 --> 48:47.293
For me?

48:47.383 --> 48:49.295
Hello?

48:49.385 --> 48:51.217
Where?

48:51.303 --> 48:53.295
Allentown?

48:53.389 --> 48:54.971
Yes.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.639
Well, when is
the next train?

48:57.226 --> 48:59.218
Right.
I'll get that.

48:59.895 --> 49:01.602
Wynant's tried
to commit suicide.

49:01.689 --> 49:04.306
They want me to go down
and identify him.

49:04.400 --> 49:07.268
Well, I guess this
changes the whole story,

49:07.361 --> 49:08.361
doesn't it?

49:08.446 --> 49:10.312
That looks like
an admission of guilt.

49:10.406 --> 49:11.567
And I had such hopes.

49:11.657 --> 49:14.616
If you got on the case,
you'd be able to clear him.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.694
I thought that Mimi...
the way she acted,

49:16.787 --> 49:19.871
I was sure that...
Oh, well.

49:19.957 --> 49:23.291
Well, there's no use
thinking about that now.

49:23.377 --> 49:26.211
I'm sorry to have wasted
so much of your time.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.880
Good-bye.
Have a merry Christmas.

49:28.966 --> 49:32.050
Thank you. Same
to you. Good-bye.

49:40.644 --> 49:43.011
Asta,
is your balloon busted?

49:43.105 --> 49:44.767
So is mine.

49:44.857 --> 49:46.689
What's the matter
with you?

49:46.775 --> 49:48.562
The mystery's
all gone.

49:48.652 --> 49:50.689
I was hoping you'd
find out who did it.

49:50.779 --> 49:52.270
Maybe I will.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.821
Well, Wynant...

49:53.908 --> 49:55.365
I don't believe
he did it.

49:55.451 --> 49:56.451
Why don't you?

49:56.535 --> 49:57.742
No reason.
Just a hunch.

49:57.828 --> 49:58.864
But I'm going
to find out.

49:58.954 --> 50:00.911
I'm tired of being
pushed around.

50:00.998 --> 50:02.910
Come on, Dr. Watson.
Let's go places.

50:10.591 --> 50:14.426
Good morning,
Nick.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.799
Well, it's not
a very nice trick

50:16.889 --> 50:19.176
you're trying to pull on me,
running out like this

50:19.266 --> 50:20.723
when I was giving you
time to rest up

50:20.809 --> 50:22.300
before I asked you
those questions.

50:22.394 --> 50:23.475
About the gun?

50:23.562 --> 50:24.769
That never was a gun.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.642
Don't waste time
talking about that.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.349
Man to man, are you
on this case?

50:29.443 --> 50:30.479
Man to man,
I'm not.

50:30.569 --> 50:31.569
But he's
interested.

50:31.654 --> 50:34.067
I'd rather you work
with us than against us.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.772
That suits me.

50:35.866 --> 50:38.404
It's a bargain.
Anything you want to know?

50:38.494 --> 50:39.701
What about the suicide?

50:39.787 --> 50:42.200
A phony. The boys didn't
even have to go down.

50:42.289 --> 50:43.289
I thought it might be.

50:43.374 --> 50:44.374
They're going to think

50:44.458 --> 50:46.415
every thin man
with white hair is Wynant.

50:46.502 --> 50:48.084
You think
Wynant did it?

50:48.170 --> 50:50.082
I don't know. He certainly
planned something.

50:50.172 --> 50:52.004
He closed up
his apartment and shop.

50:52.091 --> 50:53.091
Were you there?

50:53.175 --> 50:55.041
Yes, but I couldn't
find a thing.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.173
I figure Wynant went
to Julia's apartment

50:58.264 --> 50:59.471
and found morelli there,

50:59.557 --> 51:01.765
sees she's two-timing him.
There's a fight.

51:01.850 --> 51:04.092
He doesn't pull anything then
on account of morelli.

51:04.186 --> 51:06.644
Lets his lawyer give her money
to give to him

51:06.730 --> 51:08.813
so that she'll think
it's all blown over.

51:08.899 --> 51:11.516
When she isn't expecting it,
he lets her have it.

51:11.610 --> 51:12.896
No proof?

51:12.987 --> 51:14.944
No, nothing as yet
to cinch it.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.896
50 will get you 100,
he didn't do it.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.357
What do you mean?

51:18.450 --> 51:20.237
He was too absent-minded
to hold a grudge.

51:20.327 --> 51:21.408
Who's your candidate?

51:21.495 --> 51:22.736
I haven't gotten
that far,

51:22.830 --> 51:24.516
don't think that
everything points to Wynant.

51:24.540 --> 51:25.621
What about your alibis?

51:25.708 --> 51:27.791
Ok...
Mrs. Jorgenson, the boy,

51:27.876 --> 51:29.663
Dorothy, MacCaulay,
even morelli.

51:29.753 --> 51:30.834
We had to let him go.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.332
What about jorgenson?

51:32.423 --> 51:33.789
I'll check on that.

51:33.882 --> 51:36.499
Mrs. Charles, this
must be dull for you.

51:36.594 --> 51:38.711
Dull? I'm on the
edge of my chair.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.011
What about nunheim?

51:40.097 --> 51:41.679
He's all right.
We know all about him.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.973
He does a little stooling
for us.

51:44.059 --> 51:46.346
Did you know that he'd been
hanging around Julia?

51:46.437 --> 51:48.053
No.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.638
Holding out on you.

51:49.732 --> 51:53.225
Let's look into that.
Taxi!

51:53.319 --> 51:55.151
This may get a bit
rough, baby.

51:55.237 --> 51:57.274
I think you better
let us go alone.

51:57.364 --> 52:00.198
Catch me letting
you go alone.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.117
Grant's tomb.

52:11.587 --> 52:12.748
Taxi!

52:23.682 --> 52:24.682
Who is it?

52:24.767 --> 52:25.974
<i>John.</i>

52:30.314 --> 52:31.850
Hello, lieutenant.

52:33.609 --> 52:35.441
Sit down, Nick.

52:37.237 --> 52:38.648
I wasn't expecting you,
lieutenant.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.025
You said you'd phone.

52:45.037 --> 52:46.323
Have a shot?

52:46.413 --> 52:47.654
What's the idea
telling me

52:47.748 --> 52:50.115
you knew the Wolf girl
just by sight?

52:50.209 --> 52:53.418
That's all I did, lieutenant.
That's the god's truth.

52:53.504 --> 52:57.043
Maybe I said hello to
her or "how are you?"

52:57.132 --> 52:58.485
Or something like that
when I saw her,

52:58.509 --> 53:00.171
but that's all I did.
That's the truth.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.092
Hmph!

53:02.179 --> 53:03.886
You open your mouth,

53:03.972 --> 53:05.258
and I'll pop
a tooth out of it.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.090
Oh, is that so?

53:07.184 --> 53:08.891
Yeah!

53:11.188 --> 53:12.770
Cut it out.
Cut it out!

53:12.856 --> 53:14.768
<i>We didn't come here to
watch you two roughhouse.</i>

53:17.194 --> 53:18.685
She's driving me nuts.

53:18.779 --> 53:20.361
She's been
ragging me all day.

53:20.447 --> 53:22.609
Maybe if you quit running
around after other women,

53:22.700 --> 53:24.908
you wouldn't have so much
trouble with this one.

53:24.993 --> 53:26.655
Now, that's a lie,
lieutenant.

53:26.745 --> 53:29.704
Anybody that says that
is a liar.

53:29.790 --> 53:32.032
Want to take
a poke at him?

53:34.169 --> 53:36.456
I didn't mean you,
mister.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.914
Come on. She can't
hear you now.

53:40.843 --> 53:43.586
You know how it is,
a guy knocking around.

53:43.679 --> 53:44.989
You'd have done better
to have told me that

53:45.013 --> 53:46.299
in the beginning.

53:47.683 --> 53:48.683
Where were you

53:48.767 --> 53:50.554
the afternoon she
was knocked off?

53:50.644 --> 53:52.852
You don't think <i>I</i> had
anything to do with it!

53:52.938 --> 53:54.520
Where were you?

53:56.525 --> 53:57.686
Marion!

53:57.776 --> 53:59.233
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

53:59.319 --> 54:01.527
I don't like crooks,
and if I did like them,

54:01.613 --> 54:03.525
I wouldn't like crooks
that are stool pigeons,

54:03.615 --> 54:05.823
and if I did like
crooks that are stool pigeons,

54:05.909 --> 54:08.117
I still wouldn't
like you!

54:08.203 --> 54:11.287
Marion, don't go!
Marion, wait a minute!

54:11.373 --> 54:14.241
I'll do anything you say.
I'll behave! Don't go.

54:14.334 --> 54:16.917
Let me get after her.
Let me bring her back.

54:17.004 --> 54:19.166
I'll do anything.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.667
I'll answer anything
you want.

54:20.758 --> 54:22.545
Sit down.
We didn't come here

54:22.634 --> 54:25.126
to watch you two dance
around the maypole.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.157
Where were you the afternoon
that girl was killed?

54:27.181 --> 54:28.763
I don't know.
I can't remember.

54:28.849 --> 54:30.886
I can't tell you
just offhand.

54:31.894 --> 54:33.977
Maybe I was down at
Charlie's shooting pool.

54:34.062 --> 54:36.179
Maybe I was up here.
I don't know.

54:36.273 --> 54:37.639
She'd remember.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.210
How'd you like
to be thrown in the can

54:39.234 --> 54:40.645
on account
of not remembering?

54:40.736 --> 54:43.399
Give me a minute.
I'll remember.

54:43.489 --> 54:47.153
<i>You know I ain't stalling.
Alwa ys come clean with you.</i>

54:48.577 --> 54:50.819
Gee. Gee, sure.

54:50.913 --> 54:53.656
Sure.
I... I remember.

54:53.749 --> 54:56.457
I wouldn't blame you
if you threw me in the can.

54:56.543 --> 54:58.375
Look, I remember
where I was.

54:58.462 --> 55:00.795
That... that's the afternoon...
wait a minute.

55:00.881 --> 55:02.793
I'll show you.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.763
Well, what do you
think of him?

55:11.433 --> 55:13.265
Well, I think we're
on the right track.

55:15.562 --> 55:16.769
<i>Who are you phoning?</i>

55:17.564 --> 55:18.564
I'm phoning
your office

55:18.649 --> 55:20.936
so they can send out
a man to trail him.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.187
<i>I want to see
where he goes.</i>

55:22.277 --> 55:24.018
Trail him?
Trail who?

55:24.112 --> 55:25.478
<i>Nunheim.</i>

55:30.160 --> 55:32.493
Give me that phone.
Give me that phone.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.536
Bill, pick up nunheim.
Tell the boys.

55:34.623 --> 55:36.351
He just left here...
went down the fire escape.

55:36.375 --> 55:38.228
Cover the grand central
and Pennsylvania stations.

55:38.252 --> 55:40.619
Check all airports
and all steamship terminals.

55:40.712 --> 55:44.501
<i>What's that? No.
Have lefty radio all the cars.</i>

55:44.633 --> 55:47.376
<i>He was dressed
in a black pair of pants.</i>

55:47.469 --> 55:50.928
<i>How should I know if
his underwear's embroidered?</i>

55:51.014 --> 55:54.598
Listen, they've been
questioning me again today, see,

55:54.685 --> 55:57.894
asking me what more I know,
where I was that day.

55:57.980 --> 56:00.313
Wait a minute.
I ducked out on them.

56:00.399 --> 56:01.918
Look, if you want me
to play dumb anymore,

56:01.942 --> 56:03.558
I want 5,000 more.

56:03.652 --> 56:06.269
5,000, and I'll
blow town today.

56:08.073 --> 56:10.941
Ok. Where?

56:11.535 --> 56:13.618
All right. Right away.

56:13.704 --> 56:14.785
See that you're there

56:14.872 --> 56:16.829
and see that
you bring it with you.

56:25.048 --> 56:26.755
Aah!

56:29.970 --> 56:32.508
"Arthur nunheim,
honorary member."

56:32.598 --> 56:35.136
Nope, not a thing.

56:35.225 --> 56:36.591
Find out about
that bullet yet?

56:36.685 --> 56:39.268
Yes. It's the same gun
that killed Julia Wolf.

56:39.354 --> 56:40.561
And how are
your folks?

56:43.692 --> 56:45.308
Hello?

56:45.986 --> 56:48.729
Oh, how are you?

56:48.822 --> 56:50.859
No, we didn't
find a thing.

56:50.949 --> 56:52.030
Your wife.

56:53.744 --> 56:55.736
And, lieutenant,
I've got something.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.037
I've been doing a little
detecting on my own.

56:58.123 --> 57:00.331
That flatfoot I married
thinks he's smart,

57:00.417 --> 57:03.160
but I'm just one jump
ahead of him.

57:03.253 --> 57:06.246
That's swell, Mrs. Charles.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.688
How did you
like Grant's tomb?

57:12.596 --> 57:15.430
It's lovely. I'm having
a copy made for you.

57:18.810 --> 57:20.301
What have
you got, baby?

57:21.897 --> 57:23.229
I can't quite
hear you.

57:24.608 --> 57:27.851
Oh. We'll be
right up.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.527
She's up at Mimi's.

57:29.613 --> 57:31.070
Jorgenson
has disappeared.

57:34.117 --> 57:37.576
Chris may be at the club.
That's not important.

57:37.663 --> 57:39.463
You should have told them
that he disappeared.

57:39.498 --> 57:41.990
But he has nothing
to do with it.

57:42.084 --> 57:43.325
That's not for you
to decide.

57:43.418 --> 57:45.000
Everybody's
under suspicion,

57:45.087 --> 57:47.249
especially
running off like this.

57:47.339 --> 57:49.331
The police are going to
want a description of him.

57:49.424 --> 57:50.710
Is this his picture?

57:50.801 --> 57:52.087
He didn't do it!

57:52.177 --> 57:53.964
They'll want more
than your word.

57:54.054 --> 57:56.546
I'll tell them
who did do it,

57:56.640 --> 57:58.723
and I'll
give them proof.

58:10.612 --> 58:11.853
Dorie.

58:11.947 --> 58:13.279
Oh, Tommy.

58:13.365 --> 58:14.856
Please don't cry.

58:14.950 --> 58:17.363
I can't help it.
You don't know.

58:17.452 --> 58:19.785
Darling, you can't go
through any more of this.

58:19.871 --> 58:21.828
You get together some
clothes and your skates,

58:21.915 --> 58:24.248
and we'll go to my family
in the country.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.621
You've got to get
your mind off all this.

58:26.712 --> 58:28.248
Darling, you've
been so sweet,

58:28.338 --> 58:30.876
but there's only one thing
you could do for me,

58:30.966 --> 58:33.959
and that is to go
and never see me again.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.964
What are you
talking about?

58:36.054 --> 58:38.296
Please, you can't get
mixed up in this.

58:38.390 --> 58:40.097
Do you think
I care about that?

58:40.183 --> 58:41.640
Tommy,
you don't understand.

58:41.727 --> 58:43.162
You don't know
what's going to happen.

58:43.186 --> 58:45.849
All I know is
I want you to marry me.

58:45.939 --> 58:48.101
I can't marry you.
I can't ever marry you.

58:48.191 --> 58:49.807
Dorothy!

58:49.901 --> 58:52.439
Would you like to have
murderers for children?

58:52.529 --> 58:53.986
That would be fun,
wouldn't it?

58:54.072 --> 58:55.383
Perhaps they'd all
murder each other

58:55.407 --> 58:56.864
and keep it
in the family.

58:56.950 --> 58:58.219
That's what father
should have done.

58:58.243 --> 58:59.683
He should have killed
Gilbert and me.

58:59.745 --> 59:01.361
We wouldn't have
this to go through.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.242
You're talking
like a crazy person.

59:03.331 --> 59:05.994
Why not? I am crazy.
All our family's crazy.

59:06.084 --> 59:09.577
Dorothy, I love you.
Do you understand that?

59:09.671 --> 59:11.628
Tommy! Tommy!

59:11.715 --> 59:13.547
Please go. Go.

59:22.601 --> 59:25.810
Sleuthing isn't much fun
after all, is it?

59:25.896 --> 59:28.013
I feel awfully sorry
for that girl.

59:29.316 --> 59:30.432
Find anything?

59:31.276 --> 59:33.609
She's ready to talk.

59:33.695 --> 59:34.902
Wouldn't do any harm,
though,

59:34.988 --> 59:36.604
<i>to find out
where he is.</i>

59:36.698 --> 59:39.987
You're wrong about all your
children being murderers.

59:40.077 --> 59:42.364
Now, I've studied the
mendelian law of inheritance

59:42.454 --> 59:44.161
and their experiments
with sweet peas,

59:44.247 --> 59:45.433
and according
to their findings...

59:45.457 --> 59:46.914
and they've been
pretty conclusive...

59:47.000 --> 59:48.491
only one out of four

59:48.585 --> 59:49.996
of your children
will be a murderer.

59:50.087 --> 59:51.087
The thing for you to do

59:51.171 --> 59:53.163
would be just
to have three children.

59:53.256 --> 59:55.623
No, that might not work.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.674
The first one
might be the bad one.

59:57.761 --> 59:58.797
I'll have to
look that up.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.594
You needn't bother
about looking that up.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.297
I'm not getting married,
I'm not having any children.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.929
From now on, I'm just
out for the ride.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.386
I took it from her hand.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.847
It was Mr. Wynant's
watch chain.

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:12.940
I wanted to protect him.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.150
Well, I guess that
cinches it, eh, Charles?

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.606
He killed
them both...

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.656
the Wolf girl
and nunheim.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.359
50 will still
get you 100.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.194
That's enough
for me.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:29.407
<i>Extra! Wynant's ex-wife
produces murder evidence!</i>

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:32.289
<i>Extra! Extra!</i>

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:35.668
<i>Double murder charge
against Wynant!</i>

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.875
<i>Extra! Extra!</i>

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.052
<i>Wynant wanted
in second murder!</i>

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.424
<i>Extra!</i>

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:56.605
I wish they'd
stop that.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.231
I wonder if
they'll find him.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.654
He must be
in New York.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.276
Where do you think
you're going?

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:04.074
I'm a-gonna take
asta for a walk.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.402
He's just been.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.077
Well, we're going
sightseeing.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.621
What's that?

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:11.074
That's known in burgling
circles as a flashlight.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:15.082
Nick, what are you
up to? What is this?

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:16.583
Ooh! Looks like
a holdup.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.380
What are you
going to do?

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:21.083
I'm going to find out
why Wynant's shop is closed.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:22.714
He went away,
didn't he?

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.466
He went away a lot
when I knew him,

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.923
but he never closed the shop.
I got a hunch.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.217
Do you think
he's hiding there?

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:31.386
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out.

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:33.596
I won't have you
going down there.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.103
Hey, <i>you</i> got me
into this.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.936
I know, but he's
a crazy man.

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:40.065
He might kill you.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:41.191
He won't kill me.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.318
I've got asta
to protect me.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:46.196
All right. Go ahead.
See if I care.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:47.402
I think
it's a dirty trick

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:48.702
to bring me
to New York

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:49.788
to make
a widow of me.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.205
You wouldn't be
a widow long...

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.291
You bet I wouldn't.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.617
Not with
all your money.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:57.829
Well, any port
in a storm.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:00.336
Good-bye, sugar.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.513
Nicky!

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.135
Huh?

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.013
Take care
of yourself.

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:12.513
Oh, sure I will.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.642
Say it as if
you meant it.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.145
Well, I do believe
the little woman cares.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.646
I don't care.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.274
It's just that I'm used
to you, that's all.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.161
If you let anything
happen to him,

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:37.118
<i>you'll never wag
that tail again.</i>

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.347
You sure
this is the place?

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.344
Yeah.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.016
You don't want me
to wait, do you?

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.969
Certainly.
Not afraid, are you?

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.100
No, I guess not.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.556
All right, asta.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.619
Asta?

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:20.975
Come on, asta.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:23.645
Asta?

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:43.665
Asta, you're not a terrier.
You're a police dog.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:25.753
Whew!

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.330
No, asta. No, no.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.346
Asta, get away
from there.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:42.144
Come on.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.436
Come on.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:55.335
Hello. Lieutenant guild,
please.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.044
Hello, John?

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.504
This is Nick Charles.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.432
I'm up in Wynant's shop.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.225
Well, I found something.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:05.848
It's a body.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:41.888
Stick 'em up!

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:49.851
Turn around.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.487
Don't make a move,

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.280
or that dog will
tear you to shreds.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:08.116
You can come out.
He won't hurt you.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.666
Up to your
old tricks, Tanner?

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.146
You're Mr. Charles,
aren't you, sir?

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.286
Yes. How did you
get in?

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.623
I have a key. I worked here,
till they closed it.

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:16.716
You worked here?

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:19.589
Yes. Julia Wolf got me
a bookkeeper job.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.886
Well,
that's a hot one.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:23.464
Where did you ever
learn bookkeeping?

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:25.094
That last time
you sent me up,

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.220
I learned bookkeeping
in sing sing.

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:29.349
I figured it would be
an in for me somewheres.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.166
Somewheres where they might
leave the safe open.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.523
Honest, Mr. Charles,
I never touched that safe.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.193
Them bonds that was missing...
Julia Wolf took them.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.520
Trying to put it off
on her, huh?

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:42.073
She did. That's why he got
sore at her and killed her.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.527
Listen, can I take
my hands down?

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:45.907
Ok.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.537
I did do
a bit of chiseling.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.243
I come to bring
the money back

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:54.374
and fix up the books.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.671
Easy!

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:56.837
It's all right,
Mr. Charles.

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.920
It's just a pocketbook.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:01.630
I didn't want him
to find out

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.756
and come after me.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.462
Save that. Tell it
to the police.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:05.764
Police?

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.196
Move over,
will you?

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:24.319
Haven't you
got that yet?

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.696
You wouldn't know

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:26.889
anything about this,
would you?

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.154
No, sir.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:31.160
Take him down to central.
I'll talk to him later.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:38.956
Hmm. Wonder what Wynant
had against this one.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.586
Quicklime.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.464
Mind if I
look these over, doc?

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:43.589
No. Go ahead.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.636
Just rolled them
up and threw them in.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:48.511
Lucky thing for us these
weren't entirely eaten up.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.466
Extraordinarily
lucky.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.848
No identification.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:56.103
<i>Must have weighed
250 pounds if an ounce.</i>

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.399
Here's something.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.395
Hmm. Rubber tip.

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:02.489
Must have been lame.

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:03.573
Who wouldn't be,

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.445
carrying all that
weight around?

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:10.154
I should say he stood
about 5'11",

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:11.248
wouldn't you, doc?

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:12.493
Yeah, about.

01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:18.500
"D.w.r."

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:20.626
"R."

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.425
Say, that case
you worked on,

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.111
that man who threatened
to kill Wynant...

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.341
what was his name?

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:29.219
Rosebreen.

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.225
Say, could this
be the man?

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.311
I never saw him.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.308
I don't think anybody
ever saw him.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.139
He threatened
to kill Wynant

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.225
on account of some invention
he'd stolen, right?

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:41.105
Yes. We figured that
was just blackmail.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:44.279
He still wouldn't mind
getting rid of him, would he?

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:47.153
Doc, how long would you say
this body had been here?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.529
Can't say offhand.

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:49.860
At least a couple
of months.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:50.954
A couple of months?

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.826
That's just when Wynant
closed the shop!

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.327
It's an open book.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.250
Wynant killed this guy
and planted him here.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.077
Julia knew about it,
so he killed her,

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.538
and nunheim
caught him at that,

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.213
so he bumped <i>him</i> off.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.633
Well, boys, I guess
we'll be going.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.381
Nick, you did
a swell job.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:09.384
You wouldn't mind paying me
that $100 now, would you?

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:10.681
Wait till you
catch Wynant.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:12.975
I'll get him,
all right!

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.892
Bring that stuff
out to the car.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.739
You going to run him
through the polariscope?

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:17.773
Yes.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.849
You mind if
I come see it?

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:22.400
I'm very interested
in that body.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:25.855
Step right over here,
Mr. Charles.

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.950
There's the bullet
he was killed with. See?

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.621
Hmm.

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:40.502
Ooh...

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:42.045
What's that?

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.715
<i>Oh, just an old
piece of shrapnel.</i>

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.293
Shrapnel, huh?

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:49.673
Mmm. Well, maybe
he was in the war.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.881
That would account for
his cane and his limp.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.432
Yes. Yes.

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:57.182
<i>Extra! Extra!</i>

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:59.308
<i>Read all about the finding</i>

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.185
<i>of the body!</i>

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:02.686
<i>Extra! Extra!</i>

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.894
<i>Read all about it!</i>

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.507
Hey, doggy.
Come on.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.717
Look down at the
floor, at the body.

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:38.052
Mr. Charles,
this way.

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:39.602
Get that
out of here!

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.056
Just a moment. Mrs. Charles,
one family group.

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:43.435
For the woman's page.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.233
Do the police know
where Wynant is?

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:46.480
No.

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:47.778
You think
they'll find him?

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:48.864
I know they will.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:50.189
Got anything
else to say?

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:51.945
- No.
- What about this rosebreen?

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.991
I don't know
anything about it.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.639
Can't you tell us
anything about the case?

01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:57.871
Yes. It's putting me
behind in my drinking.

01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.164
Let's get this in.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.537
What's your
next step, Nick?

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:04.745
Back to California
to rest up from this vacation.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:06.171
We'll see you
before you go.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:08.044
Good-bye, boys.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:09.500
<i>Good-bye.</i>

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:19.058
Back to California,
huh?

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.511
My soul, woman.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:21.971
I give you
three murders,

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.771
and you're still
not satisfied.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.396
Oh!

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:28.772
Well, if you insist.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:30.399
Well, I <i>don't</i> insist.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:31.775
No, I wanted you

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.277
to stay here
and find Wynant.

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.825
I did find him.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.869
He was down
in his shop.

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:39.071
Nick!

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.202
That was his body
that was down there.

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:43.124
Darling, you'd better
lay off that liquor.

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:44.576
Well, that's a fact.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.002
Wynant's body?

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.795
Yep.

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:49.874
Say, don't you want
something to eat?

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.879
Everybody thought
it was rosebreen.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.130
That's what
they think...

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.336
guild and the rest
of them.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.466
They take it
for granted

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.390
it was another one
of Wynant's victims.

01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:00.684
Guild's out
looking for Wynant.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.227
That's all
that troubles him.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:04.396
What makes you so sure
it was Wynant's body?

01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:06.223
Well...
Several things.

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:09.355
Oh, hello. Fred?
We're hungry again.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:13.651
And lots of onions.
Oh, and, uh, coffee.

01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:15.482
You're driving me crazy.
What things?

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:16.576
Hmm?

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.618
What things
make you so sure?

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:22.823
Oh! Well, take the
clothes, for instance.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.749
They were very
carefully preserved,

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:25.916
and the body was

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:27.585
just as carefully
destroyed.

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:30.085
Whoever killed him was
counting on one thing...

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:32.211
that skeletons
all look alike.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.667
Well, they do,
don't they?

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.047
Sure.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.115
You're not getting another
swallow until you open up.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.347
I remember that Wynant
had shrapnel in his shin.

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:40.640
It used to bother him.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:42.433
I looked for it
and found it.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.556
How long
has he been dead?

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:44.646
A couple of months.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.313
Oh, then he couldn't have
committed those murders.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.187
Smart gal.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.393
Wynant dead.
Does Dorothy know?

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.694
No. Nobody knows
but you.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.737
I'm going to
tell her.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.031
You can't do that.

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:57.117
She's going crazy.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:58.387
She'd rather know
he was dead than...

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.949
I can't tell anyone.
I haven't told guild.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:02.119
Why?

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.198
I'm lying low
until I get the dope.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.907
I won't go off
half-cocked.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.083
What will you do?

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.582
I'm going to get
the murderer,

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.046
and I've got an idea.

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:13.840
You want to see me
take him?

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:14.926
Yes.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.798
Have you got
a nice evening gown?

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:18.594
What's that
got to do with it?

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.388
Have you got
a nice evening gown?

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.090
Yes, I've got
a Lulu. Why?

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.348
I'm going to give a party
and invite all the suspects.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:26.519
Suspects?
They won't come.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.187
Oh, yes, they will.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:30.891
I'll get guild to issue
the invitations.

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:32.977
Who do you think
did it?

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.356
Mimi.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:35.528
Mimi?

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.480
Mimi, jorgenson,

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:39.532
morelli, Tanner.

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:40.904
What were you doing

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:43.908
on the night
of October 5, 1902?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:49.501
I was just a gleam
in my father's eye.

01:15:57.344 --> 01:16:00.007
Let's see.
You at the head.

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:01.633
And you on my right.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:02.840
Thank you.

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:04.890
I'll put MacCaulay here.
He can help me.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.263
Ought to be a lady
next to him.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.389
I've got Mimi.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.187
I don't think
Mimi likes him.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.605
Then it's Mimi.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:12.148
Who goes next to me?

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:14.442
Leave that open.
See what you draw.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.360
Put Dorothy there.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:17.447
And then Tommy?

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.614
I'll keep Tommy on this
side. Put Gilbert next.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.283
Nice boy.
Who's next to Gilbert?

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:23.951
That bird
that shot me.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:26.246
Morelli? This <i>is
going to be good.</i>

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.665
I'll put Mimi's
gigolo husband here.

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:29.751
Have they found him?

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:30.951
They've found him.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.161
Who goes next to him?

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:33.586
I'm leaving
that open.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.959
I have a feeling
he won't come alone.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.050
Where will you
put guild?

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:38.134
Down at the end,

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:40.336
where he can keep
an eye on things

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.715
when the trouble
starts.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.798
That little friend
of nunheim's,

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:46.133
the frying-pan
juggler, there.

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:49.561
Are you sure one of these
people is the killer?

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:50.728
Positive.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:52.602
I can't stand
the suspense.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.977
Which one did it?

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:55.229
I wish you'd tell me.

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:56.605
I wish
you'd tell <i>me.</i>

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.402
Mr. Charles.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:01.903
These men will interfere
with your beautiful dinner.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.405
How's it going, boys?

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:07.203
Oh, swell.
Now, how's this?

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.406
Yes, "misseur."

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.207
Mmm.
Terrible.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.293
That's all right.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.710
Your men will serve
the dinner.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.708
These boys are
just here in case.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:17.505
I think they're going
to be all right.

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:19.002
<i>Hello, Mrs. Charles.</i>

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:20.709
Oh, hello, Mr. Guild.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.294
I see
you're all set.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:23.424
Do you think
they'll come?

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:24.755
Most of them
are here already.

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:28.092
My men are
picking up the rest.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:29.426
Bring them in, boys.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.136
You're a great help
to a hostess.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.688
I wish I had you
at all my dinner parties.

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:36.608
Let go of my arm,
you big lug!

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:38.151
I ain't
done nothin'.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.694
Oh, it's you, huh?

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.737
We only wanted you
to dine with us.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.941
If you think I'll talk,
you're crazy.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.834
Just 'cause I was mixed
up with a stool pigeon

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.031
don't mean I'm one, too.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:49.864
Absolutely not.
Show the lady a chair.

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:52.370
On your way, sister.

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:53.459
Did you find
Dorothy?

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:55.001
No, but
she'll be here.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.703
What you need
is a drink.

01:17:56.797 --> 01:18:00.086
I should think you guys
are tired of picking me up.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:01.542
Step this way, kid.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:02.751
What's up?

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:03.845
It's outrageous!

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:05.295
How do you do,
Mrs. Jorgenson?

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.506
How dare you send
a detective after us?!

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.136
We wanted to be sure
you'd get here.

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:10.762
I told him
we couldn't come.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.640
We're going
to the theater.

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:14.642
Nicky's putting on
a little show of his own.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:17.850
You must stay.
Please come have a cocktail.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:21.562
What's the gag?

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:22.816
You know
as much as I do.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:23.988
Have a cocktail.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:25.281
No, thanks.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.983
I said
have a cocktail!

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:29.990
He wants us
to have a cocktail.

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:33.372
Hi, MacCaulay.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:34.700
Take off
your hat and coat

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:36.375
and join
our festivities.

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:38.624
Oh, Tanner.
What's this?

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.376
They had me in jail
last night.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.002
Don't think
a thing of it.

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:44.004
Tanner,
take off your things.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:45.380
What is it,
Mr. Charles?

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.383
I've got
something, I think.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:48.805
Come in, Tanner.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.052
Where's Dorothy?

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.182
I thought
she was with you.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.310
She left the house
this afternoon.

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:54.977
Here she is now.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.477
We picked them up at
the Pennsylvania station.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.682
Come on in.

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.483
Hello, Nick.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.026
A party, huh?

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:03.569
Yes.

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.522
Celebrating father's
third murder?

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:06.968
They were trying to
make a getaway.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.699
We were doing
nothing of the sort.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.322
You can't
get away with this.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:11.573
How right you are.

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.781
Take this... Gentleman's
hat and coat.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.331
Music. Much music.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:16.828
Nick interrupted me

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:19.411
at a very important
time of my life.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:22.293
I was about to take
my first false step.

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:24.375
I'm getting
out of here.

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:26.084
No. You stay here.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.636
If I stay, I'm going
to take a poke at him.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.634
Then I insist
that you stay.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:33.471
Here's jorgenson.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.347
Why, Chris!

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.429
How do you do?
I'm Nick Charles.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:39.059
Chris, where
have you been?

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.435
None
of your business.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.267
I swear
it isn't my fault.

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:44.193
I tried to keep you
out of this.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.818
Take your hands
off him.

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:48.443
Do you hear me?

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:50.533
Chris, what does
this mean?

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:51.735
Sorry we're late.

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:54.037
We had to break down
the door.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.706
Chris,
how could you? Oh!

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:59.250
Do come in and make
yourselves comfortable.

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:01.202
Take the gentleman's
hat and coat.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:02.663
Come, friends,
and get it.

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:05.123
Tommy, would you like
to be end man?

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.083
Mr. Jorgenson,
next to Tommy.

01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:09.669
<i>Dorothy, you
and Mr. Quinn are here.</i>

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.800
MacCaulay,
here, if you will.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.927
Tanner, down there.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:17.762
Oh, Mrs. Jorgenson,
next to Mr. Jorgenson.

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:19.437
I'm Mrs. Jorgenson!

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:20.523
Put it over there,
sister.

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:22.473
I was Mrs. Jorgenson
before you were.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:25.481
Oh, Mimi,
uh... You're here.

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:28.605
Oh, waiter,

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:30.907
will you remove
the illumination, please?

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:33.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
be seated.

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:38.157
<i>Now, my friends, if I ma y
propose a little toast.</i>

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.958
Let us eat, drink,
and be merry,

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:43.537
for tomorrow we die.

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:47.541
You give such charming parties,
Mr. Charles.

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:48.841
Thank you,
Mrs. Charles.

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:50.293
Perhaps you'll
tell us now

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:51.878
why we're here.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:55.136
We're here because I have
some very important news.

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.432
What is it?

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:57.884
Just this.

01:20:57.978 --> 01:21:01.096
Clyde Wynant did not kill
Julia, nunheim, or anyone.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.352
What are you talking about?
It's in the papers.

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.558
He didn't
kill them?

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:06.267
What did I
tell you?

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:07.398
I'd like to
believe that.

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:09.195
I knew they'd
pull something.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:10.362
If you got money,

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:11.509
you can get by
with anything.

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.149
Quiet!
Let him have his say.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.075
What makes you
say that, Nick?

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:16.744
<i>I saw him last night.</i>

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:17.866
Where?

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:19.868
That's nothing.
I saw him myself.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:21.494
I told you.

01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:23.747
It's a frame-up.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:25.373
When did <i>you</i> see him?

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:28.123
Last night,
in my apartment.

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.709
Is that so?
What did he say?

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.295
He wanted to know
how I was

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:34.800
and how
the children were.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.256
What was he wearing?

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:39.764
Uh, brown suit,
brown shoes,

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.060
a white shirt,

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.388
a grayish tie
with reddish-brown

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:45.144
or brownish-red dots
in it.

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:46.234
Tell the men.

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.901
I saw him, too,
wearing a green suit.

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:52.071
What are you saying?
You weren't even there.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.157
I know, but I saw him.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.358
<i>Where?</i>

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:55.817
I was gazing
in my crystal.

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:03.082
Waiter, will you
serve the nuts?

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:05.876
I mean, will you serve
the guests the nuts?

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:08.125
Mimi, I'm afraid
you're lying.

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:10.502
I really <i>did</i> see
Wynant last night.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.424
Are you kidding?

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:14.503
What's the idea
of holding out on me?

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.838
You saw him
yourself.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.173
That was
his body

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.348
buried
in the shop.

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:20.801
Nick!

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:22.851
<i>Dorothy, it's terrible
to tell you this way,</i>

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.224
<i>but your father
is dead.</i>

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:26.852
<i>He's been dead
three months.</i>

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.433
I'm terribly...

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.814
you have something
on your coat.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:32.816
Oh, darling,
please don't cry.

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:34.772
It's terrible,
I know,

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.278
but isn't it
better that way?

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.451
I'll take care
of her.

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:41.825
Uh, Tommy...

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:43.577
Tommy,
you sit here.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.704
Waiter, will you
kindly remove that?

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.669
What? No one eating?

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.372
Ah! Mimi, I see it hasn't
affected your appetite.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:52.958
Because I don't
believe a word of it.

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.258
What's your proof?

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:55.960
A piece of shrapnel
in his shin.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:57.670
If he didn't do it,
who did?

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:00.222
The murderer is
right in this room,

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.596
sitting at this table.

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:04.598
You may serve the fish.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:05.849
Eat something,
you fool.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.601
Won't you tell us who?

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:08.932
I don't know.

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:11.268
I thought if we had
a little get-together,

01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:13.353
we might find out.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.154
Nice food, isn't it?

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.984
Yes. It's the best dinner
I ever listened to.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:21.364
Who do you think did it?

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:27.787
Morelli.

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:29.335
You can't
pin this on me!

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:30.912
What am I,
the fall guy?

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.247
Sit down!

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:33.957
<i>I only want
to ask a question.</i>

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:36.293
Morelli,
you knew Julia.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:37.502
Yeah.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:38.757
Was she gypping Wynant?

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.964
She don't say.
I figure she is.

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:42.058
<i>Why's that?</i>

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:44.634
I wanted 5 grand.
She gave me cash.

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:47.933
Thanks.
Three months ago...

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.263
the night that
Wynant caught you

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:51.399
in Julia's apartment,
morelli...

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.526
he discovered Julia
was cheating on him

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:55.444
and splitting it
with some man.

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:57.944
That man was... Tanner.

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:01.739
Oh, I'm so sorry,
Tanner.

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.785
Don't you want
some wine?

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:05.829
No. Really,
Mr. Charles,

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:07.282
I had nothing
to do with this.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:08.742
<i>Tanner, sit down.</i>

01:24:08.835 --> 01:24:10.497
<i>That's all right,
Tanner.</i>

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.749
You're driving
me crazy.

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:15.794
Oh, now, let me see.
Where was I?

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.546
Oh, yes.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:19.548
Wynant went
to find the man

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:22.051
he accused
of having cheated him.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:25.008
That man, knowing he was
caught dead to rights

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:26.764
and with prison
staring him in the face,

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:28.685
took the only way out.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:30.559
He killed Wynant.

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:32.185
Now, Mr. Jorgenson...

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:33.276
yes?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.023
<i>You're not eating.
Don't you care for oysters?</i>

01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:37.149
I was listening

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:38.239
to what you were
saying.

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:39.939
Good.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:44.444
This murderer
is very clever.

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:47.872
He studied this whole thing out
very carefully.

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:50.166
You'd understand that,
wouldn't you, Gilbert?

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:52.164
Yes. No!

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:55.246
He planned the whole thing
beautifully.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.706
After he killed Wynant,

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.792
he wired MacCaulay
using Wynant's name

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:00.342
<i>and told him
to close the shop.</i>

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:01.429
Which I did.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:03.175
Naturally.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.182
Then he destroyed
all of Wynant's clothes

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:07.884
with the exception
of his watch chain.

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:10.397
<i>He figured tha t someday
that might come in handy.</i>

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:12.309
Then he took Wynant's body

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:14.607
and buried it
with another man's clothes...

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:17.231
a fat man's clothes
to throw us off the track.

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:19.813
<i>He put in a belt buckle
with an "r" on it,</i>

01:25:19.906 --> 01:25:21.738
hoping we would think
it was rosebreen...

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:25.819
an old enemy of Wynant's
who disappeared years ago.

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:27.619
Oh, morelli,

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.993
would you mind holding
your knife some other way?

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:31.995
<i>You're worrying Gilbert.</i>

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:36.455
If that knife's missing,

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.380
I'll look for it
in your back.

01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:41.505
After our hero
had killed Wynant,

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:43.086
he had a brilliant idea.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.469
He realized he and Julia
could still collect money.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:48.299
Wynant was supposed to be
out of town.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:49.600
No one knew where.

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:51.552
Our hero wrote letters
to MacCaulay,

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:52.683
signing Wynant's name,

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:55.436
so MacCaulay would continue
to send money to Julia.

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:57.232
He even telephoned
MacCaulay.

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.935
That first day
you came to see me,

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:00.440
he telephoned
he was in town.

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:01.771
He called
while I was out.

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:03.652
Wasn't he slick about that?

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:08.237
That same afternoon,
Julia telephoned him.

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.071
She said that
you were coming, Mimi.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.827
I wanted to ask
about Mr. Wynant.

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:15.035
Exactly. Well, our hero
got terrified.

01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:17.248
He was afraid that Julia
would break down and tell you

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:19.080
he had murdered Wynant.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:22.838
So he went to Julia,
and he killed her.

01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:25.511
He left Wynant's watch chain
in her hand.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:26.883
<i>Is this true?</i>

01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:27.973
I don't know.

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:29.219
Why are you
saying it?

01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:30.595
It's the only way
it makes sense.

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:32.393
I hope
you're well.

01:26:34.398 --> 01:26:36.230
His plan was working
beautifully.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.109
Everybody believed
that Wynant was in town

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.436
and that he had done it.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:43.692
There was just one hitch...

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:46.365
a bird named nunheim...
<i>Your</i> friend.

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.534
<i>Nunheim had gone
to call on her.</i>

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.156
He heard the shots.

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:52.079
He saw
the murderer leave.

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:53.497
He knew who did it.

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.744
If he knew,
he didn't tell me!

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.919
You can't drag me
into this!

01:26:58.004 --> 01:27:00.838
Our hero had paid nunheim once
to keep his mouth shut.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:02.540
When nunheim
threatened him again,

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:03.875
he bumped <i>him</i> off.

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:05.335
Oh, he was very clever.

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:07.716
Everybody, even
our astute friend guild,

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:10.264
<i>thought Wynant was alive
and was the murderer.</i>

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.057
You can skip that.

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:15.979
But our hero had just one
weak link in his chain.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.431
The telegrams and phone calls
were all very well,

01:27:18.525 --> 01:27:20.391
but no one had actually
seen Wynant,

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:24.570
so our hero picked on poor Mimi
to strengthen his case.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.113
Mimi is the only one
at this table

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:28.737
who can tell us who
the <i>real</i> murderer is.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:32.662
Mimi, who told you to say
you saw Wynant?

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.364
Nobody told me.
I <i>did</i> see him.

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:36.575
Let my mother alone!

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:38.125
What were you paid?

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.543
It's true.

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:41.416
I <i>did</i> see him.
He isn't dead!

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:44.294
You're lying.
You'd do anything for money.

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:46.876
You were getting a good price
for saying you saw Wynant.

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.962
You figured you won't
get anything if he's dead.

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:51.388
I'm not staying here
to be insulted!

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:53.683
MacCaulay, you drew up
Wynant's will.

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:55.852
Wasn't Mimi cut off
if she remarried?

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:57.178
I have no right
to answer that.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.513
Tanner, isn't that true?

01:27:58.607 --> 01:27:59.607
Yes.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.399
That shouldn't keep you from
telling the truth.

01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:04.899
Mrs. Jorgenson, were you
ever divorced from Chris?

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:06.229
No.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:07.905
<i>You see, Mimi,</i>

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:09.653
<i>under the law,
you've never remarried.</i>

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:11.530
You're still
one of the heirs.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.112
Are you holding out
for a few dollars

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:15.822
when you can get
the whole estate?

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:20.081
Remember the other two mixed in
with him... Julia and nunheim.

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:23.004
When he thought they might talk,
he bumped them off.

01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:25.627
<i>He won't take
any chances on you.</i>

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:27.208
Do you want to be next?

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:28.302
You dirty
little...

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:32.880
Well, there's your murderer...
MacCaulay.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.306
<i>MacCaulay?</i>

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:36.349
Sure. Want me to wrap him
in cellophane?

01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:37.517
<i>Come on.
Get in there!</i>

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.812
MacCaulay!
I can't believe it.

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:41.855
Well, I'll be
a monkey's uncle!

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:43.934
Nicky, he might have
killed you!

01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:45.484
You sorry he didn't?

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:47.778
I'm glad you're
not a detective.

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.735
Not a hip
in a carload.

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:55.741
Well,
here's to you two!

01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:57.743
And to you two,
too!

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:05.080
Why, the rat!
He can't top us.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.173
No.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:07.624
Toot, toot!

01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:10.084
Shall I keep these
fresh for you?

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.178
Yes,
thank you.

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:14.797
My gracious!

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:15.891
It's 1:00.

01:29:15.976 --> 01:29:17.308
It's what?

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:18.394
It's 1:00.

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:20.014
No, baby,
it's 11:00.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:22.267
It's 1:00.
I set my watch ahead.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:24.770
You set your watch
to 12:00, didn't you?

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:27.022
You're in New York,
for instance...

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:28.569
Nick.

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:31.568
<i>San Francisco is 3,000
miles west of New York.</i>

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.820
<i>The sun does not get
to San Francisco...</i>

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:36.277
Nick. Nick!

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:37.371
<i>Yes, baby.</i>

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:39.697
Does that mean
it's bedtime?

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:42.909
Well,
that's a thought.

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:45.120
Oh, well.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.000
Come on, sugar.
Leave us do it.

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:48.090
Asta.

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:49.214
Well, good night,
children.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.418
Good night.

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:52.922
And flights
of angels

01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:55.050
sing thee
to thy rest.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.381
Same to you,
Nick.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:57.474
Good night.

01:29:57.559 --> 01:29:59.471
Nora, I can never
thank you enough.

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:00.597
Oh, don't be
silly.

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:03.145
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:08.059
Gosh, darling,

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:10.110
I thought they'd
never leave.

01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:13.690
Oh, I thought
you'd <i>never</i> leave.

01:30:13.783 --> 01:30:16.696
Baby, the sun rises
in the east.

01:30:16.786 --> 01:30:18.277
It sets in the west.

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:20.454
If it's 12:00 in New York,
automatically it's...

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.908
Nicky, put asta in here
with me tonight.

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:26.915
Oh, yeah?
