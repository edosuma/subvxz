<i>...test cricket, and the first ball
the day from Gillies.</i>

02:17.875 --> 02:19.541
Dylan!

02:20.125 --> 02:22.000
Dylan!

02:22.541 --> 02:24.625
Dylan!

02:48.500 --> 02:49.625
Clive!

02:53.750 --> 02:55.583
Clive!

03:27.500 --> 03:28.875
See ya later.

04:03.583 --> 04:06.041
Hey, Dylan. Nice phone.

04:06.166 --> 04:09.666
You expecting a call from 1997?

04:23.875 --> 04:26.250
- Make it stop! Make it stop!
- Seriously?

04:26.333 --> 04:30.500
Good morning, everybody.
You know the drill. It's sombrero time.

04:30.583 --> 04:34.625
All devices in the Sombrero of Joy.
Ay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay!

04:34.750 --> 04:36.500
Thank you, seÃ±oras.

04:36.583 --> 04:39.083
Are you well this morning, everybody?
Everyone well, are they?

04:39.166 --> 04:40.958
Thank you very much.

04:41.041 --> 04:44.625
Kevin. Payload, please.
Thank you, Kevin.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.458
- Wait.
- Here we go.

04:47.583 --> 04:51.208
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Anything else?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.875
- I thought there might be.
- Yeah.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.916
- Game Boy. That's old-school.
- And that.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.541
- There's probably a couple more.
- Oh, sorry. Got one more.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.208
One more phone. Everyone needs two.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.875
Are we done? At least you're reading
your books, which is...

05:05.166 --> 05:07.250
Thank you very much. Everybody...

05:07.375 --> 05:12.083
This morning,
we shall start with a pop quiz.

05:12.416 --> 05:15.249
Psyched! We're actually
gonna have some fun today.

05:15.333 --> 05:19.124
I have a student teacher from Melbourne.
Please, everyone, say hello to Jethro.

05:19.249 --> 05:20.458
- Hi, Jethro.
- Hi, kids.

05:20.583 --> 05:24.333
We're gonna head to the hall. Everyone out
of your chairs. We'll make our way quietly.

05:26.791 --> 05:31.624
Today, I'm going to teach you
how to make the perfect paper plane.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.249
Alright, so, first time,
we're gonna make it however you want.

05:36.374 --> 05:38.458
You can do it your own design,
whatever you like.

05:38.583 --> 05:41.749
We'll just pass these around.
Pass those around. There you go.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.666
And then I'll teach you
some tips a bit later.

05:44.166 --> 05:47.249
- So who's gonna make the best paper plane?
- I'm gonna make the best paper plane.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.583
- Not me.
- Not you? Come on!

05:49.708 --> 05:51.416
Where's your confidence?

05:51.541 --> 05:53.999
So how far do people think
they can get their planes?

05:54.083 --> 05:56.541
- 10 metres? 5 metres?
- 50.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.874
50? You're dreaming.

05:59.791 --> 06:05.666
The distance world record
for a paper plane is 69.13 metres.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.624
That's a long way.

06:08.708 --> 06:13.499
To even qualify for the junior championship,
you need to hit at least 25 metres,

06:13.624 --> 06:17.749
which would mean it'd have to go over
that wall and halfway down the veranda.

06:17.874 --> 06:19.999
- Does anyone reckon they could do that?
- We could do that.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.999
- You reckon you can get it past that wall?
- We can do that. We can do that.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.833
- You reckon you can do that? We'll see.
- I know how we'll do it.

06:26.958 --> 06:29.249
Alright. If you're finished,
hold up your paper plane.

06:29.666 --> 06:33.499
Oh, there's some good ones in there.
Pretty good. Alright! Get up. Let's do it.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.166
- Everyone up.
- Let's go, people. Come on.

06:35.291 --> 06:38.541
Come on. Move the chairs.
We're gonna see who can go the furthest.

06:38.666 --> 06:42.833
Alright, let me see your planes. Good.
Good. Oh, that's good. Interesting. Nice.

06:42.916 --> 06:45.791
Nice. All ready?
Ready to launch? On my count.

06:45.874 --> 06:50.874
One, two, three!

07:03.791 --> 07:06.124
Guys, come on!

07:51.124 --> 07:52.958
That's incredible.

07:53.041 --> 07:55.624
- What's your name, mate?
- Dylan Webber.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.999
Thought about making
a career out of this?

08:00.124 --> 08:03.458
- Making paper planes?
- Yeah.

08:42.791 --> 08:44.666
Dad!

08:45.332 --> 08:47.124
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

08:48.374 --> 08:50.749
- Guess what.
- What?

08:50.832 --> 08:54.916
If I can make a paper plane fly 25 metres
in the state competition on Sunday,

08:54.999 --> 08:57.916
I can make it to the Aussie
junior championships in Sydney.

08:57.999 --> 09:00.124
It'll be really fun, and we can
practise on the weekends.

09:00.207 --> 09:04.124
- I've already got a bit of a...
- I'm sorry, what...? What?

09:05.957 --> 09:08.124
- What?
- You didn't go to work today, did you?

09:09.499 --> 09:11.624
You've just gotta lift.

09:12.041 --> 09:14.666
- Okay. I know.
- Yeah.

09:19.832 --> 09:21.457
Lifted.

09:25.457 --> 09:28.082
Now. Tell me more
about your paper plane.

09:28.957 --> 09:31.957
Tell me about the 25 metres.

09:32.082 --> 09:34.749
If I can make a paper plane
fly 25 metres.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.541
- Yeah?
- I might just get a chance to compete

09:37.624 --> 09:41.666
in the Aussie junior
championships in Sydney.

09:41.791 --> 09:43.832
- Will it?
- Oh, it already did.

09:43.916 --> 09:47.166
This was, of course,
before the landing, which was a bit...

09:47.249 --> 09:48.791
You think?

09:48.916 --> 09:51.624
Personally, I think it's the way
that you fold the paper.

09:51.707 --> 09:53.541
Pinching it, just...

09:54.041 --> 09:56.707
- to make that crease.
- How do you know all this?

09:56.957 --> 10:01.332
Like, the... the creases
and the folding and the...

10:01.916 --> 10:03.749
Mum taught me.

10:11.124 --> 10:14.374
- What are we gonna have for dinner?
- I don't know. What do you want?

10:14.457 --> 10:16.499
I don't mind. Oh.

10:16.624 --> 10:18.999
How does this sound for a plan?

10:19.124 --> 10:20.832
Your favourite.

10:28.957 --> 10:31.499
Nine, eight. We can't wait.

10:31.582 --> 10:34.266
Seven, six. Dylan's got tricks.

10:34.291 --> 10:36.374
Five, four. Fly through the door!

10:37.082 --> 10:39.666
Three, two, one. Okay.
Let's get this party started.

10:39.957 --> 10:43.707
- Yep. Rocking is about to commence.
- Great.

10:44.207 --> 10:46.707
- Alright.
- Here we go.

10:50.707 --> 10:53.666
- Well, that was embarrassing.
- Again.

11:02.041 --> 11:04.041
Again.

11:04.124 --> 11:05.916
Again.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.999
Again.

11:08.416 --> 11:09.832
Again!

11:09.916 --> 11:12.082
You've got no idea how irritating
that 'again' thing is, by the way.

11:12.207 --> 11:13.791
Again.

11:33.457 --> 11:35.707
- What do I do?
- You figure it out.

11:36.791 --> 11:39.916
That's not really helpful advice
from a teacher.

11:40.041 --> 11:43.416
Well, as your teacher, I'm telling you
to use your brain and figure it out.

11:44.249 --> 11:46.791
I'm about to rub out section three.
Are we finished it?

11:46.916 --> 11:49.916
- Yes.
- Brilliant!

11:56.291 --> 11:59.416
This is how I make a piece
of paper fly 25 metres.

12:07.291 --> 12:11.582
Try not to be annoying your whole life,
Kevin. Back on your chair, mate.

12:13.291 --> 12:16.415
Right. Where were we?

12:31.665 --> 12:34.874
- So lovely to see you again.
- Thank you. My pleasure.

12:34.957 --> 12:37.082
Grandpa! Hi.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.749
- Hello.
- Dylan!

12:41.374 --> 12:42.999
How you going, mate?

12:43.707 --> 12:46.457
Who was that lady, Grandpa?

12:47.374 --> 12:50.999
She's just an old friend, that's all.
I was just... just helping her out.

12:51.082 --> 12:54.665
Well, must have done a fine job,
because she looks pretty happy.

12:54.749 --> 12:57.957
It's important to have pride
in your work.

12:58.499 --> 13:03.290
So my plane flew
over 50 metres first time.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.332
It didn't go anywhere close the next.

13:06.332 --> 13:10.415
You... you were a... you were a pilot.
Do you have... any ideas?

13:10.540 --> 13:14.874
Well, maybe we can fashion
some sort of a small engine

13:14.999 --> 13:16.957
and fix it to the airframe.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.707
You know, I'm actually
pretty sure you can't do that.

13:20.832 --> 13:24.207
We could make it very small
so's... so no one'd notice.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.832
I believe they call that... cheating.

13:29.249 --> 13:34.290
Course, I only had experience,
you know, flying powered aircraft.

13:34.374 --> 13:39.165
That was during the war. So...
There's only one thing for it, mate.

13:39.290 --> 13:41.582
You'll have to put your thinking cap on.

13:41.665 --> 13:44.040
Right. Well, that's what my teacher
said as well.

13:44.165 --> 13:46.999
Anyway. This is me, then.

13:49.499 --> 13:52.457
- Hello, Beryl.
- Hello.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.499
You gonna... help her out too?

13:57.374 --> 14:00.249
Thanks for dropping by, kiddo.

14:42.665 --> 14:44.249
- Wake up!
- What? What, what, what?

14:44.374 --> 14:48.207
- Come on. Come on!
- What? What? What?

14:48.332 --> 14:52.082
- What? What? What?
- I've got an idea.

14:54.665 --> 14:59.040
You know, I can transfer those
to a DVD or a... a flash drive.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.874
What, you gonna try and drag me
into the 21st century?

15:01.999 --> 15:04.207
Or the 20th.

15:06.332 --> 15:08.707
Got it. Come here. Come on!

15:09.540 --> 15:12.499
This is Australia's greatest
sporting moment.

15:12.582 --> 15:16.957
Everyone remembers it because...
this was the... first time we won.

15:19.665 --> 15:23.124
<i>'Australia II' picked up an amazing
one minute and 18 seconds</i>

15:23.207 --> 15:26.957
<i>and with that, slid into the lead
with one leg to sail.</i>

15:27.040 --> 15:29.540
<i>And this was what won it
for 'Australia II'.</i>

15:29.665 --> 15:31.624
<i>- The bulbous winged keel...</i>
- There.

15:31.707 --> 15:34.165
<i>...that made the West Australian
12-metre so competitive.</i>

15:34.249 --> 15:38.207
You see it? There. That.
That's the winged keel. Alright, now...

15:38.332 --> 15:43.040
They kept it a secret, and the reason
was 'cause Ben Lexcen, the designer,

15:43.165 --> 15:45.873
he knew better than anyone
how a boat went through the water.

15:45.957 --> 15:49.957
Keels used to be like this.
He made his like this.

15:51.207 --> 15:52.832
So, what's your winged keel?

15:54.665 --> 15:58.707
- Well, I don't have a winged keel.
- Well, then, you gotta find it.

15:59.623 --> 16:01.457
That is what everyone says.

16:01.540 --> 16:04.540
Grandpa, my teacher.

16:04.623 --> 16:06.873
And now you.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.123
Okay. Here's some advice.

16:17.457 --> 16:20.290
Study everything that flies.

16:25.790 --> 16:27.623
Right.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.040
Oh, I should go back to bed.

16:34.957 --> 16:36.998
Hey.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.082
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.332
Thanks, Dad.

16:45.332 --> 16:49.123
Hey, your grandad had some...
some toys in the shed, yeah?

16:49.207 --> 16:51.665
Maybe some of them could fly, you know?

16:51.790 --> 16:53.665
Yeah.

17:35.957 --> 17:37.790
What?

17:37.873 --> 17:39.873
Shoes.

17:40.998 --> 17:43.498
Who needs that many shoes?

18:48.290 --> 18:50.748
You having fun playing
with your little toys?

18:52.457 --> 18:55.582
I'm not playing, Einstein.
It's research.

18:55.665 --> 18:58.040
That's research?

18:58.123 --> 19:00.123
Look, if you're gonna come
up here and cause a problem,

19:00.248 --> 19:01.832
can you go, 'cause I want to...

19:01.915 --> 19:06.415
Okay, but... My dad
used to have one of those.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.123
I know how to set it up.

19:10.832 --> 19:12.040
Great.

19:15.873 --> 19:16.831
Awesome.

19:28.081 --> 19:31.873
- Sorry. It's really old?
- That's fine.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.915
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

19:38.623 --> 19:41.165
- Better stand back.
- Yeah, come on.

19:52.081 --> 19:54.915
- That is so cool!
- Awesome!

19:54.998 --> 19:59.081
- What happens now?
- I don't know.

20:05.456 --> 20:07.998
Okay, go! Run!

20:10.998 --> 20:13.498
Get to the fence! The fence! Run!

20:15.248 --> 20:16.665
Dive, quick!

20:25.456 --> 20:28.290
Doesn't get much closer than that.

20:36.498 --> 20:38.831
Sorry about...

20:38.915 --> 20:43.581
you know, making fun of your lame phone
and throwing the paper at you.

20:43.998 --> 20:46.123
That's alright.

20:46.206 --> 20:50.081
Just don't be a bully.
I can't stand bullies.

20:50.331 --> 20:54.748
Well, bullies and... getting needles.

21:01.873 --> 21:03.790
Mates?

21:05.331 --> 21:07.123
Mates.

21:07.248 --> 21:09.248
I've never had one of those before.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.581
Just a heads-up...
we've gotta get going pretty early

21:29.706 --> 21:33.790
if we want to make it to the state
competition tomorrow. Alright?

21:33.956 --> 21:35.331
I'm there.

21:36.123 --> 21:37.498
You're there?

21:38.790 --> 21:40.873
Yeah. I'm there.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.873
I'm counting on you.

21:52.706 --> 21:55.290
Hey. Hey, hey! Oi, oi, oi.

21:55.373 --> 21:59.331
- Wake it up. Get up, get up.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

22:02.373 --> 22:04.540
Come on!

22:12.790 --> 22:14.831
Clive!

22:15.790 --> 22:17.623
Clive!

22:19.956 --> 22:21.915
Wah!

22:22.498 --> 22:24.706
See you later!

22:48.414 --> 22:52.248
Okay, be careful not to go over the line.
We're aiming for 25 metres, okay?

22:52.373 --> 22:57.039
Are you ready? Three, two, one, throw!

22:58.956 --> 23:00.956
Oh, very good throws.

23:01.039 --> 23:03.289
Grab your planes.

23:04.164 --> 23:06.998
Okay, next group up to the line, please.

23:13.998 --> 23:15.539
There you are, Dylan.

23:18.248 --> 23:19.873
Yep.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.706
Excuse me. Do you mind
if my son has a photo with you?

23:29.831 --> 23:31.831
No, not at all.

23:34.248 --> 23:35.789
- Got it?
- Thank you very much.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.289
- All the best today, Alex.
- Thank you.

23:38.873 --> 23:42.123
- Hi, Patrick. Can I get your autograph?
- Yeah, sure.

23:45.498 --> 23:47.414
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:47.914 --> 23:51.623
You know, when Muhammad Ali was my age,
he'd already started boxing.

23:51.706 --> 23:55.248
He once caught a kid stealing his bike
and wanted to learn how to beat him up.

23:55.331 --> 23:58.081
You do realise Muhammad Ali
ended up with Parkinson's disease,

23:58.164 --> 24:01.748
- unable to talk, right?
- That's not the point, Patrick.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.831
Hey, stop calling me that.
I'm your father.

24:03.914 --> 24:07.123
The point is,
he started somewhere, okay?

24:07.248 --> 24:10.581
My journey to become a champion
starts here, today.

24:11.373 --> 24:14.289
Being champion
shouldn't be the goal anyway.

24:14.914 --> 24:16.623
You're saying it doesn't matter
if you win or lose?

24:16.706 --> 24:18.581
No. I'm saying it's how you play
the game that counts.

24:18.664 --> 24:22.664
You know the only people who say that
are the ones who've already lost.

24:24.289 --> 24:26.706
Winners celebrate winning.

24:26.831 --> 24:28.289
- Hi.
- What was your name?

24:28.414 --> 24:31.373
- Dylan Webber.
- Jason Jones.

24:31.456 --> 24:33.414
...throw!

24:35.456 --> 24:38.373
Very good. Now, go grab your planes.

24:39.206 --> 24:41.623
Right, next group up to the line.

24:41.748 --> 24:45.206
Can I get the next group
up to the line, please?

24:45.956 --> 24:48.456
Right, be careful not to step over,

24:48.539 --> 24:50.748
'cause if you do, that's a foot foul.

24:50.831 --> 24:53.539
Now, we're aiming for over 25 metres.

24:53.623 --> 24:55.706
If you throw over 25 metres today,

24:55.789 --> 25:00.123
you qualify for the national junior
paper plane championships in Sydney.

25:01.039 --> 25:04.081
We're gonna count down
from three to one,

25:04.164 --> 25:08.248
and when the flag drops,
make sure it's your best throw.

25:08.331 --> 25:10.623
Are you ready?

25:11.039 --> 25:15.539
Three, two, one, fly!

25:42.456 --> 25:44.748
Yeah! Almost 30 metres!

25:44.831 --> 25:48.498
Congratulations. Very good.

25:51.289 --> 25:53.748
Hi. I'm Dylan.

25:53.831 --> 25:55.289
Jason.

25:55.789 --> 25:58.539
Hey, I gotta go.

26:00.248 --> 26:02.081
Yeah, well done, Jase.
That was terrific.

26:02.164 --> 26:03.789
- Thanks.
- You happy?

26:03.914 --> 26:04.914
Yeah, I guess.

26:05.039 --> 26:08.873
Excuse me, Mr. Jones. My dad's
too shy to ask for a photo with you.

26:08.956 --> 26:11.081
- So he told me I had to do it.
- That's fine, mate.

26:11.164 --> 26:13.872
- Come in, daddy-o.
- Thanks.

26:14.247 --> 26:19.122
That putt you sank to win the British
Open... I mean, that was just...

26:21.081 --> 26:23.539
- Thanks. Cheers.
- You see?

26:23.831 --> 26:26.622
Winners do celebrate winning,
even 20 years later.

26:26.747 --> 26:28.956
I think you're missing the point, mate.

26:29.081 --> 26:32.164
Am I, Patrick? Am I?

26:54.206 --> 26:56.414
Where have you been?

26:56.831 --> 26:59.497
At the paper plane competition.

27:00.497 --> 27:02.664
Which was today.

27:04.872 --> 27:08.997
Maybe I should have put it on one of the
old videos that you're always watching.

27:10.581 --> 27:12.747
Had to go on my own,
and I almost missed the bus, alright?

27:12.831 --> 27:15.456
I tried to wake you, but...

27:17.081 --> 27:19.122
Yeah.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.206
But what?

27:22.997 --> 27:25.039
You just decided to take money
from my wallet?

27:28.831 --> 27:32.997
- Yeah, to buy a bus ticket.
- Alright. Well, you're grounded.

27:33.706 --> 27:34.581
Yeah.

27:34.872 --> 27:37.997
- I did it 'cause you wouldn't wake up.
- One week.

27:40.081 --> 27:42.164
I made it through to the finals,
if you're interested.

27:42.247 --> 27:45.914
- Great.
- They're next week, in Sydney.

28:15.081 --> 28:17.039
Grandpa!

28:18.289 --> 28:20.664
What are you doing here?

28:20.747 --> 28:23.122
I've been thinking
about this plane of yours.

28:23.622 --> 28:25.206
How did you get out?

28:25.289 --> 28:29.122
Get out? I'm not a prisoner of war, boy.

28:29.747 --> 28:31.706
I know you need
written permission to leave.

28:31.831 --> 28:33.872
Nah, nah. That's just red tape.

28:35.372 --> 28:39.997
Hey, hey, hey. Grandpa. Did you...
Did you borrow that ambulance?

28:40.372 --> 28:43.581
I prefer 'stole'.

28:47.539 --> 28:49.622
This is the way to travel, kiddo.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.581
Let's have a bit of excitement.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.747
We should do this more often, kiddo.

29:26.039 --> 29:28.622
Grandpa, how many laws
have you broken today?

29:28.706 --> 29:30.247
Three.

29:31.706 --> 29:33.039
Four.

29:50.580 --> 29:55.497
Here, boys, doesn't this
bring back some memories?

29:58.664 --> 30:02.830
Great! I was hoping it was still here.

30:04.705 --> 30:05.955
Come on, son.

30:06.455 --> 30:09.039
And... put this on.

30:10.955 --> 30:12.747
I'm too old for this, Pa.

30:12.830 --> 30:16.122
Quite the contrary. I'm too old
for this. But just put it on.

30:16.205 --> 30:19.164
But when they arrest us,
I don't want to look like an idiot.

30:19.747 --> 30:23.039
Just put it on and get up here.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.414
Right.

30:30.664 --> 30:32.705
- Are you right?
- Yep.

30:33.580 --> 30:38.289
Buckle yourself in, son.
This is gonna be one hell of a flight.

30:38.872 --> 30:40.747
Okay.

30:40.830 --> 30:45.664
Engine ignites.
And we're racing across the runway.

30:46.164 --> 30:49.830
- Grandpa, what are you doing?
- And we lift off!

31:00.080 --> 31:03.039
Enemy fighters at 12 o'clock!

31:03.122 --> 31:05.414
Hang on!

31:07.330 --> 31:08.955
They're on us, Grandpa! They're on us!

31:10.997 --> 31:13.039
They're coming in hard!

31:16.164 --> 31:18.122
Look out!

31:18.872 --> 31:20.622
We're hit!

31:22.205 --> 31:25.914
- The controls are dead!
- I'll take the controls.

31:27.289 --> 31:29.622
The flaps, kiddo!

31:29.705 --> 31:31.372
Raise the flaps!

31:34.247 --> 31:35.914
You can do it!

31:55.955 --> 31:57.455
Hello, George.

32:16.622 --> 32:18.539
- Is that right?
- Yes, yes.

32:18.622 --> 32:21.955
But what you want to do
is try throwing with the flaps up.

32:22.039 --> 32:23.789
Yeah.

32:24.205 --> 32:26.372
Give that a go.

32:27.164 --> 32:29.539
You've gotta be kidding.

32:30.789 --> 32:32.914
Hey, it was fun getting arrested
with you, Grandpa.

32:32.997 --> 32:35.997
Cautioned. Not arrested, cautioned.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.205
Alright. Well...

32:38.289 --> 32:42.122
You know, you really rock,
for someone so old.

32:44.080 --> 32:48.372
- See you on the flip side, kiddo.
- Not if I see you first!

33:38.247 --> 33:41.580
Dylan! Wake up!

33:41.997 --> 33:44.663
Wake up, Dylan. I know you're in there!

33:44.747 --> 33:47.038
Wake up! Dylan!

33:49.622 --> 33:53.288
Come on, Dylan. Get out here
with your clothes on!

33:53.413 --> 33:56.163
Dylan! Get out
of that stinking bed of yours!

33:56.288 --> 33:57.205
What?!

33:57.288 --> 34:00.788
I'm helping you make
paper planes for Sydney.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.205
I'm being supportive.
That's what mates do.

34:05.913 --> 34:08.371
Right. Thanks, man.

34:08.455 --> 34:12.080
- Now, hurry up and get up here.
- Alright.

34:17.788 --> 34:19.080
Well, that blew chunks.

34:19.288 --> 34:23.580
Hey, stewardess.
Is there a movie on this flight?

34:31.913 --> 34:34.663
Hurry up! Get up here!

34:35.955 --> 34:38.080
Hurry up!

34:38.163 --> 34:41.455
Get those paper planes up here!

34:42.996 --> 34:45.080
Dylan!

35:18.205 --> 35:21.288
Do you think the car
will make it to Sydney?

35:44.705 --> 35:47.372
Thanks for doing this, Dad.

35:52.330 --> 35:54.747
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:32.247 --> 36:37.247
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the junior
paper plane competition here in Sydney.

36:39.247 --> 36:44.413
I'm Maureen Prescott,
1985 junior champion of Australia!

36:44.496 --> 36:46.746
We love you, Maureen!

36:47.288 --> 36:50.371
You've all been chosen
because you have a great gift...

36:50.955 --> 36:53.913
the ability to turn this...

36:57.996 --> 37:00.246
into this.

37:02.746 --> 37:08.871
In 1999, this plane took me to compete
in Cape Town, South Africa.

37:14.080 --> 37:18.996
What? It's such a lame plane.
I thought it was a joke.

37:20.538 --> 37:21.871
Boo yourself.

37:22.413 --> 37:24.038
Anyway...

37:24.205 --> 37:30.080
Today, let me introduce a guest
from Japan... Kimi Muroyama.

37:33.455 --> 37:37.621
Kimi is Japan's current
paper plane junior champion.

37:55.746 --> 38:00.163
Australia is home
to my favourite bird, the emu,

38:00.246 --> 38:02.871
a bird that cannot fly.

38:04.621 --> 38:08.621
I'm so excited to be here,
because I get to meet you

38:08.705 --> 38:11.163
and to see your planes.

38:31.705 --> 38:33.288
Let's go!

38:34.038 --> 38:35.788
- Dad!
- Yeah.

38:35.871 --> 38:37.871
- The competition starts today.
- Yeah?

38:37.996 --> 38:40.621
And... parents are invited.

38:40.705 --> 38:43.246
So... maybe you can come this time.

38:43.371 --> 38:47.121
Hey. Stand here. Just stand here.

38:47.205 --> 38:49.746
Alright, yeah. Ready?

38:50.163 --> 38:53.663
Did you get it?
Hey, I gotta make a call.

38:54.288 --> 38:55.371
What?

38:56.330 --> 38:59.955
- Who you making a call to?
- It's just a girl.

39:02.205 --> 39:04.621
- A girl?
- Yeah.

39:04.705 --> 39:07.788
Well... I'll give you some privacy.

39:12.413 --> 39:13.496
<i>Reception.</i>

39:13.580 --> 39:18.996
I just wanted to ask for a room number
for Kimi Muroyama.

39:19.621 --> 39:22.746
- <i>1612.</i>
- Awesome. Thank you.

39:22.830 --> 39:26.371
1612. 1612.

41:31.413 --> 41:34.329
"Do emus dream of flying?"

41:35.579 --> 41:38.163
You are quite the wordsmith.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.663
- How did you get that?
- You threw it into my room, idiot.

41:41.746 --> 41:45.621
Our poor Japanese visitor
has only been here for one day,

41:45.704 --> 41:49.663
one day, and you've already managed
to embarrass her with a weird love letter.

41:49.746 --> 41:51.996
What's he talking about?

41:52.079 --> 41:55.996
- Look. Just give it back.
- Or what?

41:56.079 --> 41:58.038
- Or we'll have a problem.
- Really?

41:58.163 --> 41:59.413
- Yeah.
- And what would that be?

41:59.496 --> 42:01.329
Don't know, but I guess
you're about to find out.

42:01.413 --> 42:03.788
Is that so?

42:14.871 --> 42:17.746
Oops. Sorry.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.538
He's not worth it.

42:21.621 --> 42:24.454
Yeah. Yeah.

42:28.163 --> 42:30.371
"Do emus dream of flying?"

42:30.954 --> 42:34.454
- Too much?
- It's beautiful.

42:40.829 --> 42:45.829
So, you are the chosen finalists
from all around Australia.

42:47.454 --> 42:52.663
Today, you're going to compete
in a series of challenges.

42:53.121 --> 42:57.746
The winners will get to go to the world
junior paper plane championships

42:57.829 --> 43:00.538
in Tokyo, Japan!

43:07.079 --> 43:11.163
Okay, everyone,
form into your teams, and good luck!

43:17.871 --> 43:19.829
On your mark,

43:19.954 --> 43:23.121
get set, go!

43:49.329 --> 43:53.662
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

43:53.787 --> 43:58.996
Five. Four. Three. Two. One. And stop.

44:05.412 --> 44:07.704
Take your positions.

44:14.579 --> 44:16.537
Okay.

44:18.162 --> 44:22.537
Three, two, one. Go!

44:35.746 --> 44:39.079
Beat that.
That's what I'm talking about.

45:20.079 --> 45:21.912
Hi.

45:23.121 --> 45:25.621
That was awesome.
That was really incredible.

45:25.746 --> 45:27.746
Thank you.

45:33.496 --> 45:35.662
What are you doing to that poor plane?

45:36.537 --> 45:38.787
It's a whale.

45:38.912 --> 45:40.287
Right.

45:40.412 --> 45:43.204
My father always said to look
at the natural world

45:43.287 --> 45:46.121
for answers to life's challenges.

45:47.121 --> 45:49.704
And you're sure that that works?

45:49.787 --> 45:51.787
Yes.

45:51.912 --> 45:53.954
Alright.

45:54.287 --> 45:59.496
Wouldn't it be great if it was about
more than whose plane flies the furthest?

45:59.621 --> 46:04.996
If it was about making something
beautiful or surprising?

46:05.079 --> 46:07.996
That's the competition I want to win.

46:08.954 --> 46:12.371
You're mad. Absolutely mad.

46:12.454 --> 46:15.162
This is it... the final challenge.

46:15.287 --> 46:18.829
If you succeed, you will get
to represent Australia

46:18.954 --> 46:21.829
at the world championships in Tokyo.

46:25.746 --> 46:32.079
The goal is to reach the end of the
50-metre pool without using a run-up.

46:32.204 --> 46:35.954
Your plane must touch
the far end of the pool.

46:36.079 --> 46:40.579
If you don't touch the end of the pool,
you won't be going to Tokyo.

46:41.912 --> 46:45.829
Okay, time to throw.
Let's start from this end.

46:45.912 --> 46:47.621
And go!

46:58.746 --> 46:59.829
Go!

47:06.454 --> 47:08.329
Go!

47:10.871 --> 47:13.079
Officials, please, could you help her?

47:16.079 --> 47:18.829
Right. And go!

47:37.579 --> 47:38.745
And...

47:40.245 --> 47:42.162
go.

48:01.579 --> 48:04.120
Come on!

48:08.037 --> 48:10.495
And go!

48:46.079 --> 48:49.162
Yes! These are our winners!

48:49.287 --> 48:52.620
Dylan and Jason are our winners!

48:52.704 --> 48:57.037
Our Australian representatives
going to Tokyo!

48:58.370 --> 49:01.620
Representing Australia!

49:24.037 --> 49:27.912
Dad? Dad, Dad, Dad. Dad, Dad.

49:28.037 --> 49:30.912
- Second in Australia.
- That's great.

49:30.995 --> 49:33.412
Yeah, that's great.
I've got to work on my distance.

49:33.537 --> 49:36.829
That's gonna win me the finals. I reckon
we should start practising on the weekend

49:36.912 --> 49:40.204
so we can find my winged keel.
Imagine how good it'll be then.

49:40.287 --> 49:44.037
Well, the finals are in Japan. So?

49:44.454 --> 49:46.495
Can I go?

49:48.870 --> 49:50.787
Japan?

49:53.162 --> 49:55.204
- Japan is expensive.
- I know.

49:55.287 --> 49:57.704
But I thought that if,
A, you start working

49:57.787 --> 50:01.745
and, B, I get an after-school job,
I could at least make it there and back.

50:01.870 --> 50:04.162
Yeah, maybe.

50:06.329 --> 50:08.245
"Yeah, maybe"?

50:08.329 --> 50:10.620
What does that mean? Does that mean
that you're gonna start working?

50:10.704 --> 50:14.245
- Can I get an after-school job?
- I can't...

50:14.995 --> 50:16.829
It's so...

50:16.954 --> 50:19.454
Oh, it's Japan.

50:19.537 --> 50:22.412
It's an after-school job.

50:22.495 --> 50:24.245
It's ridiculous.

50:24.787 --> 50:27.162
It's not gonna happen.

50:27.870 --> 50:30.245
It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

50:30.329 --> 50:32.870
You're sorry? No, you're not.

50:32.995 --> 50:34.537
- You are not sorry.
- Oh, come on.

50:34.662 --> 50:36.912
We're in Sydney.
You've been in here the whole time.

50:36.995 --> 50:39.620
You didn't even come to the competition,

50:39.704 --> 50:42.078
which is the reason that we're here.

50:42.162 --> 50:44.787
Look. Look at this.

50:44.912 --> 50:47.453
There's a world out there, alright?

50:47.745 --> 50:50.287
You don't... You just don't get it.

50:50.370 --> 50:55.995
I don't get it? You don't get it, Dad!
You don't get it. I'm 12 and I get it.

50:56.537 --> 51:00.453
She's dead. She's not gonna come back.

51:00.537 --> 51:04.537
Ever. We're never gonna see her again.

52:17.578 --> 52:18.828
- Well done.
- Thanks.

52:18.953 --> 52:22.412
- Great job, Dylan. Congratulations!
- Thanks.

52:31.162 --> 52:33.037
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:33.328 --> 52:36.037
- You know, I'd love to stay in contact.
- That'd be great.

52:36.162 --> 52:38.328
I was thinking Skype?

52:38.412 --> 52:40.412
Yep.

52:44.828 --> 52:47.453
- What?
- Sorry.

52:47.787 --> 52:51.287
Ready for that lift to the airport?
The officials have organised it with my dad.

52:51.412 --> 52:54.412
- What?
- Yeah. We're leaving now. Come on.

52:54.828 --> 52:57.453
Okay. Didn't know that.

52:57.537 --> 52:59.953
- 'Bye, Dylan.
- 'Bye...'bye, Kimi.

53:02.787 --> 53:04.495
Skype address.

53:31.495 --> 53:34.370
Dropped ball!

53:37.037 --> 53:38.995
Dylan!

53:43.703 --> 53:46.120
- So?
- Came second.

53:46.245 --> 53:48.787
Got into the world champs.

53:50.245 --> 53:53.453
Tokyo. That's in China, right?

53:53.537 --> 53:56.328
Dylan, my boy. Congratulations.
Excellent work, my friend.

53:56.453 --> 53:58.370
Inside. Here we go. You know the drill.

53:58.453 --> 54:00.870
- Sombrero time, people.
- Sombrero time.

54:12.953 --> 54:15.120
Stop, Clive.

54:18.620 --> 54:21.203
How do you do it, Clive?

54:22.328 --> 54:25.120
How do you stay up there for so long?

54:42.870 --> 54:44.661
- Hi.
- Hello.

54:44.786 --> 54:49.370
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good. This is...

54:49.453 --> 54:51.953
This is me.

54:52.036 --> 54:54.411
This is where I live.

54:54.786 --> 54:57.203
Hi! Hello.

54:57.286 --> 55:00.870
- Hi. Hey.
- Sorry. That was my mum.

55:00.995 --> 55:03.620
Hi. You were right.

55:03.745 --> 55:06.036
The answer is in the natural world.

55:06.120 --> 55:08.745
I found out that with the bird of prey,
it's their wingspan

55:08.870 --> 55:13.453
that keeps them in the air for so long.
So imagine this is the bird... it kind of...

55:13.578 --> 55:15.036
changes its wingspan.

55:16.578 --> 55:20.245
It changes it as it glides.
And that just keeps it up.

55:20.370 --> 55:23.495
Get some paper. I'll show you something.

55:23.578 --> 55:26.870
If you like birds, you'll like this.

55:29.495 --> 55:33.995
Follow me. Grab this corner.
And pull it through the fold like this.

55:43.370 --> 55:45.870
Now, this is called the valley line.

55:49.953 --> 55:52.661
- Like this?
- That's right.

55:53.620 --> 55:57.495
And now, the tricky bit. See?

55:57.578 --> 56:00.453
It's called the diamond shape.

56:02.536 --> 56:04.786
- This?
- Yes.

56:05.995 --> 56:08.870
Now, the pinch for the neck and beak.

56:10.411 --> 56:15.078
And voila! See?
You can turn paper into anything.

56:21.370 --> 56:23.411
It's great.

56:26.911 --> 56:28.870
Thanks, Kimi.

56:44.870 --> 56:48.703
<i>Tell us about the kids who are going
to Tokyo. Dylan and Jason.</i>

56:48.786 --> 56:51.745
<i>Dylan and Jason, Dylan and Jason.
They are amazing.</i>

56:51.828 --> 56:54.411
<i>They have two very different planes.
Two very different techniques.</i>

56:54.495 --> 56:57.870
Dad, Dad, Dad! I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
Come on, come on, come on. Come here.

56:58.203 --> 57:00.453
<i>Jason and Dylan, our world champions.</i>

57:00.536 --> 57:04.328
I got, I got it. Okay. It's recording.

57:04.411 --> 57:06.453
<i>- How does that feel?</i>
- This is the other guy.

57:06.536 --> 57:09.203
<i>I'm very... I'm thrilled, actually.
A different event, which is terrific.</i>

57:09.328 --> 57:12.453
<i>- He has his own thing.
- Patrick.</i>

57:13.745 --> 57:16.911
<i>You're very skilled at making
paper planes. What's your trick?</i>

57:17.036 --> 57:19.370
<i>Well, you see, the trick to making
the perfect paper plane</i>

57:19.453 --> 57:23.120
<i>is to study its flight path in a space
with absolutely no movement of air.</i>

57:23.203 --> 57:26.870
<i>And that opportunity was provided
for Jason today in Sydney.</i>

57:26.953 --> 57:29.745
<i>That is correct. I have been studying
how my plane works.</i>

57:29.828 --> 57:32.245
<i>It is truly amazing. I was amazed at...</i>

57:32.370 --> 57:36.578
- That's a bit unfair.
- <i>And it will be amazing. Trust me.</i>

57:36.661 --> 57:39.995
- We can't even afford my flights.
- <i>In other news</i>...

57:46.994 --> 57:49.161
Come with me.

57:50.494 --> 57:52.744
- Come on.
- Now?

57:52.828 --> 57:54.661
Come on!

57:55.953 --> 57:58.161
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

57:58.286 --> 58:00.494
Where are we going?

58:01.703 --> 58:03.411
Come on!

58:18.286 --> 58:20.494
What do you reckon?

58:27.828 --> 58:30.703
Buy up, people. Buy up big.

58:34.244 --> 58:36.994
Anything you see on the table. You want?

58:37.078 --> 58:39.411
It's too much.

58:39.994 --> 58:42.036
Hello, Mabel. Anything?

58:42.661 --> 58:45.619
- Nothing.
- You've sold nothing?!

58:46.453 --> 58:48.411
Mr. Hickenlooper?

58:49.411 --> 58:54.161
- How are we going money-wise?
- Maybe... half of what you need.

58:54.286 --> 58:56.078
Sorry, mate.

58:56.203 --> 58:59.286
But, hey, day's not done yet. Chin up.

58:59.369 --> 59:00.536
Kiddo!

59:02.578 --> 59:04.661
Grandpa!

59:05.203 --> 59:06.869
Kiddo!

59:06.994 --> 59:08.911
Grandpa!

59:08.994 --> 59:12.786
So where do we set it up?

59:15.828 --> 59:18.453
- Look at this.
- Cakes! Cake!

59:20.953 --> 59:22.494
- How are you, mate?
- Very well indeed.

59:22.619 --> 59:25.119
Ladies. Ladies. Ladies.

59:46.453 --> 59:48.911
How much for the piano?

59:48.994 --> 59:52.078
- That's not for sale.
- Come on, mate. Everything's for sale.

59:52.369 --> 59:54.994
I could do with the money, but it's...

59:55.078 --> 59:57.536
- No, it's just not for sale.
- Two grand.

59:58.869 --> 01:00:03.619
- It's worth a lot more than that, mate.
- Okay, okay. Look... 2-5.

01:00:03.703 --> 01:00:06.536
No, I'm sorry. It has sentimental value.

01:00:06.619 --> 01:00:09.369
There's nothing more sentimental
than a roll of cash, mate.

01:00:09.453 --> 01:00:13.453
- Okay. Three grand. Not a penny more.
- It belongs to my wife.

01:00:13.578 --> 01:00:16.453
You'd better get her down here, mate. She
might be able to talk some sense into you.

01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:18.911
She's clearly not using it.

01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:21.119
Please.

01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:23.994
Yeah.

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:27.453
Yeah, I'm sorry. I... I...
I just want it for my daughter.

01:00:27.578 --> 01:00:30.411
She's... just starting out.
You know, she's good.

01:00:30.536 --> 01:00:32.953
She's really talented. But...

01:00:33.453 --> 01:00:35.244
Sorry.

01:00:36.786 --> 01:00:40.911
If you change your mind, give me a call.

01:00:55.661 --> 01:00:59.411
- Quite a few sales?
- Yeah, it's okay.

01:00:59.494 --> 01:01:01.328
- Do you want to just pop it here?
- Oh, yep.

01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:03.453
Thanks, mate.

01:01:07.703 --> 01:01:11.244
Okay. I've got the total
from today's event.

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:14.077
Oh, yeah.

01:01:14.452 --> 01:01:15.827
Yeah?

01:01:16.619 --> 01:01:21.036
$1,745.65.

01:01:22.452 --> 01:01:24.327
1,000?

01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:30.036
Those old ladies with the scones?
They moved a lot of units.

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:34.619
And that, Dylan, is enough
to get one of you to Japan.

01:01:34.702 --> 01:01:36.494
Mr. Hickenlooper.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.952
And you're... you're certain
you counted it up correctly?

01:01:40.036 --> 01:01:42.036
Dylan. I'm your maths teacher.

01:01:44.536 --> 01:01:47.202
Everyone! I'm going to Japan!

01:01:47.786 --> 01:01:51.036
Terrific! Oh, wonderful!

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:55.452
- Good on ya!
- Nice one, Dylan!

01:01:57.077 --> 01:01:59.911
- Thank you, Mr. Hickenlooper.
- That's alright, mate.

01:02:01.202 --> 01:02:03.744
I don't have to get any vaccination
to go to Japan, do I?

01:02:03.869 --> 01:02:07.994
- No, mate, not for Japan.
- That's alright.

01:02:08.077 --> 01:02:10.161
I just cannot stand needles.

01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:13.036
Go and tell your dad?

01:02:14.702 --> 01:02:16.952
Hey. We...

01:02:20.702 --> 01:02:23.869
<i>Splash Daddy. Splash Daddy!</i>

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.744
<i>Splash Daddy.</i>

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:48.952
<i>Say "Hi, Daddy."</i>

01:02:49.036 --> 01:02:51.619
<i>"Hi, Daddy!"</i>

01:02:57.452 --> 01:02:59.952
<i>You gonna go in the water?</i>

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:29.327
- Just come to the airport, Dad, please?
- You'll be fine.

01:03:30.744 --> 01:03:33.077
I know I'll be fine, but...

01:03:33.536 --> 01:03:36.661
- I can't leave you like this.
- I'll be fine.

01:03:37.786 --> 01:03:40.619
- Alright. Then I'm not gonna go.
- Yes, you are.

01:03:40.702 --> 01:03:42.369
I'm not going.

01:03:42.494 --> 01:03:45.786
You're gonna go and have a great time.

01:03:45.869 --> 01:03:47.786
- 'Cause you love it, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:50.786
- Love your paper planes.
- I love it.

01:03:53.036 --> 01:03:54.952
Why do you love it so much?

01:04:01.369 --> 01:04:04.952
Because... for those few moments
that the plane is flying...

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:10.286
I can forget.

01:04:13.827 --> 01:04:15.411
Forget what?

01:04:17.786 --> 01:04:19.911
This.

01:04:46.452 --> 01:04:48.202
I...

01:04:48.327 --> 01:04:51.410
thought you might like something
to remind you of home,

01:04:51.494 --> 01:04:53.785
if you're missing us.

01:05:03.244 --> 01:05:05.869
Oh, you're still
my favourite living fossil.

01:05:05.994 --> 01:05:11.410
So you go forth and partake
in this grand adventure, little man.

01:05:11.494 --> 01:05:13.535
I will.

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:20.244
Can you check up on Dad?

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:23.077
Just keep an eye on him?

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.077
Will do.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.535
- You are having fun?
- Yeah.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:44.202
Ladies and gentlemen,
our ceremony is about to commence.

01:06:44.327 --> 01:06:45.785
Please take your seats.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.160
Kimi!

01:06:49.244 --> 01:06:52.202
- You made it.
- Hey!

01:06:53.994 --> 01:06:56.785
Don't you want to go and meet
some of these people?

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.744
You know I've got no time
for that, Patrick.

01:07:01.827 --> 01:07:03.869
Stop calling me Patrick.
I'm your father.

01:07:04.452 --> 01:07:06.660
- How are you?
- Better now you're here.

01:07:06.785 --> 01:07:08.202
- You look cool.
- Yeah.

01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:10.452
This is fun. This is exciting.

01:07:13.119 --> 01:07:16.327
That's the thing.
You need to do better, you know?

01:07:16.452 --> 01:07:19.035
You need to be focused on me.
They're the enemy.

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:23.369
No, they're not. They're a pleasant people
who make paper aeroplanes as a hobby.

01:07:23.452 --> 01:07:26.327
Maureen Prescott,
please come to the stage.

01:07:26.452 --> 01:07:29.285
We can't be friends with them, okay?

01:07:29.369 --> 01:07:32.910
They're competitors, alright?
Competitors.

01:07:36.494 --> 01:07:39.744
- Do you want me to go home a loser?
- I think that's a simplistic question.

01:07:39.827 --> 01:07:42.827
Oh, yes, it is.
Do you want me to go home a loser?

01:07:42.952 --> 01:07:45.869
- Well, no, but...
- Good. Now prove it.

01:07:45.952 --> 01:07:48.619
Please come to the stage.

01:08:16.202 --> 01:08:20.118
Welcome, everyone,
to the imperial garden in Tokyo.

01:08:20.243 --> 01:08:23.577
The five steps in the traditional process
of making paper

01:08:23.702 --> 01:08:25.577
is here in the garden today.

01:08:26.952 --> 01:08:29.243
Before you fold paper,

01:08:29.327 --> 01:08:33.243
you have to understand
and appreciate how to make paper.

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.410
- Arigato.
- Thank you.

01:09:28.827 --> 01:09:30.535
Hey, stop it!

01:09:30.618 --> 01:09:33.702
What are you afraid of? It's just paper.

01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:35.785
Hey, mate.

01:09:36.827 --> 01:09:39.118
What do you think you're doing?

01:09:39.202 --> 01:09:42.452
Besides embarrassing
20 million Australians.

01:09:42.577 --> 01:09:45.368
- Pull your head in.
- What did you just say?

01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:47.743
- You heard.
- What did you just say?

01:09:47.827 --> 01:09:49.702
Jump ahead a few minutes.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:52.743
How do you think this is
gonna work out for you?

01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:44.618
Hey.

01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:49.660
You gonna go and cry to your dad
when you come last in the finals later?

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:55.118
Back off, Jason. You're doing a great job
to make sure you don't have any friends.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:58.243
Maybe I am.

01:10:58.327 --> 01:11:00.910
But at least my father's here
to see me win.

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:03.952
- Right.
- White trash.

01:11:08.993 --> 01:11:10.618
Dylan!

01:11:19.452 --> 01:11:22.160
It seems like you have
sprained your wrist.

01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:27.535
- It will take a week to recover.
- A week?

01:11:27.618 --> 01:11:30.952
This is... this is my throwing wrist.
I need to use it tomorrow.

01:11:34.035 --> 01:11:36.285
Lucky you have another wrist.

01:11:38.868 --> 01:11:42.076
What happened? What happened?

01:11:42.201 --> 01:11:43.535
I tripped.

01:11:43.826 --> 01:11:47.701
- You tripped?
- Yeah, I tripped. Really, it's fine.

01:11:49.868 --> 01:11:51.660
Really.

01:11:52.535 --> 01:11:55.243
Get some rest.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

01:11:55.368 --> 01:11:58.326
By the looks of it, it doesn't seem
like I'm doing anything tomorrow.

01:12:03.493 --> 01:12:07.035
- There might be one thing we could do.
- Yeah? What... what?

01:12:08.035 --> 01:12:10.410
Do you really want this wrist
to get better?

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:13.243
Yes. Anything. Anything.

01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:24.785
Not to worry. Only 12 more.

01:12:32.743 --> 01:12:35.326
It's not that bad.

01:13:11.785 --> 01:13:15.785
- How is it feeling?
- Not great.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.243
May I have a look?

01:13:24.618 --> 01:13:27.035
Well, it's...

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:29.660
Friends don't keep secrets.

01:13:31.035 --> 01:13:32.160
Yeah.

01:14:01.285 --> 01:14:03.035
That's my mum.

01:14:03.118 --> 01:14:06.160
Oh. She's beautiful.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.910
She... she died five months ago.

01:14:13.451 --> 01:14:15.993
She was a piano teacher.

01:14:17.118 --> 01:14:18.785
What happened?

01:14:19.993 --> 01:14:22.660
A car accident.

01:14:22.743 --> 01:14:24.826
Oh. That sucks.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:27.368
Yeah. Badly.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.076
So your dad didn't come because of work?

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.160
Well, my... my dad hasn't done
a lot of work since the accident.

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:43.868
Yeah, well... well, he hasn't
really done a lot of anything.

01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:45.576
At all.

01:14:47.451 --> 01:14:50.701
Thank you. That's amazing.

01:14:54.368 --> 01:14:56.535
I should have just let it be. I sh...

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.076
I shouldn't have said anything to Jason.

01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:02.743
That guy's a bully.
You did the right thing.

01:15:02.868 --> 01:15:05.618
Yeah, but is it...
is it worth losing for?

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:09.159
- Winning and losing doesn't matter.
- Come on.

01:15:09.951 --> 01:15:15.951
It doesn't. It's about making something
beautiful, and surprising.

01:15:16.034 --> 01:15:18.076
Like your book.

01:15:19.451 --> 01:15:23.034
Look, I know what you're saying,
but you still want to win, right?

01:15:26.743 --> 01:15:28.659
If you have to ask me,

01:15:28.784 --> 01:15:31.826
then you haven't been listening
and don't know me at all.

01:15:36.534 --> 01:15:38.493
Sorry?

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:40.659
You're going?

01:15:43.284 --> 01:15:45.243
What?

01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:47.784
What happened?

01:16:01.868 --> 01:16:06.659
<i>Dear Mother, it's been so long</i>

01:16:06.743 --> 01:16:10.451
<i>Since I had to say goodbye</i>

01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:16.659
<i>They say time flies but I must say</i>

01:16:17.951 --> 01:16:22.368
<i>Sometimes it just crawled by</i>

01:16:23.368 --> 01:16:27.201
<i>I still think about you every day</i>

01:16:28.534 --> 01:16:32.826
<i>I hope that comes as no surprise</i>

01:16:34.409 --> 01:16:38.826
<i>How I would love to see you now</i>

01:16:38.951 --> 01:16:42.701
<i>What I wouldn't give</i>

01:16:45.326 --> 01:16:50.409
<i>But life did not bend to my wishes</i>

01:16:50.909 --> 01:16:55.951
<i>And so I had to learn to live...</i>

01:16:58.868 --> 01:17:00.701
Hey.

01:17:00.826 --> 01:17:04.284
- It's Dylan, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:04.368 --> 01:17:05.909
Think you're gonna win tomorrow?

01:17:05.993 --> 01:17:09.076
I don't know.
But I really, really want to.

01:17:09.201 --> 01:17:11.784
Yeah? Why is that?

01:17:12.743 --> 01:17:15.534
Well... You know,
everyone loves a winner. Right?

01:17:16.451 --> 01:17:20.868
And if... if I go home a winner,
maybe my dad...

01:17:20.993 --> 01:17:23.576
might want to hang out with me.

01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:27.159
Well, you know what? He's family, mate.

01:17:27.284 --> 01:17:31.576
And sometimes... sometimes they take
a little while to come good.

01:17:31.659 --> 01:17:34.784
But, if you stick with them,

01:17:34.868 --> 01:17:36.701
they will, eventually.

01:17:38.409 --> 01:17:40.201
Well, I hope you're right.

01:17:40.618 --> 01:17:42.784
Thanks, Mr. Jones.

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:57.159
<i>Dear Mother, I know I'm not the only one</i>

01:17:57.243 --> 01:18:02.576
<i>Who had someone taken away too young</i>

01:18:02.659 --> 01:18:07.993
<i>Still, that doesn't make it feel alright</i>

01:18:08.076 --> 01:18:13.451
<i>To not have had you then
and still not have you now</i>

01:18:13.909 --> 01:18:18.909
<i>I still think about you every day</i>

01:18:18.993 --> 01:18:23.076
<i>I hope that comes as no surprise...</i>

01:18:27.743 --> 01:18:31.659
<i>Hi, Dad. How's everything going?</i>

01:18:32.284 --> 01:18:34.534
<i>Hopefully good.</i>

01:18:34.951 --> 01:18:38.951
<i>Tokyo's great.
Well, in fact, it's amazing.</i>

01:18:39.076 --> 01:18:42.409
<i>Today, I learnt all about making paper
in the ancient gardens.</i>

01:18:42.492 --> 01:18:45.117
<i>That was pretty cool.</i>

01:18:45.201 --> 01:18:49.826
<i>Well, the finals start tomorrow.
Pretty nervous. Been working on my planes.</i>

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:53.826
Yeah, everything's great.

01:18:53.909 --> 01:18:58.034
Oh. I sprained my wrist,
which is... bit of a bummer.

01:18:58.117 --> 01:19:01.784
But it's feeling better
thanks to the help of acupuncture,

01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:05.451
<i>which was pretty good, but...</i>

01:19:05.534 --> 01:19:08.159
<i>Yep. I've been having
the most amazing time.</i>

01:19:08.284 --> 01:19:12.492
<i>It's really fun. Hopefully,
we come back here some day. And...</i>

01:19:16.076 --> 01:19:19.784
I wanted... I wanted
to say to you that I'm...

01:19:22.701 --> 01:19:25.284
I'm going to stick with you...

01:19:26.367 --> 01:19:30.576
<i>for as... for as long as it takes.</i>

01:19:36.242 --> 01:19:38.201
Yeah.

01:19:38.284 --> 01:19:40.117
Hope you got that.

01:19:40.534 --> 01:19:44.742
<i>Yeah. Well, I'll... see you soon.
Wish me luck.</i>

01:19:46.242 --> 01:19:48.701
<i>Love you, Dad. 'Bye.</i>

01:21:04.117 --> 01:21:07.784
Welcome to the eight
finalists of this year's

01:21:07.867 --> 01:21:11.909
world junior paper plane championships!

01:21:28.534 --> 01:21:33.659
Today's competition is being watched
across the world!

01:21:44.826 --> 01:21:49.117
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

01:21:54.784 --> 01:21:59.451
Would the finalists please move
to the competition area?

01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:08.742
- Good luck.
- I don't need any luck.

01:22:08.825 --> 01:22:11.617
I hope you get a really bad paper cut.

01:22:12.284 --> 01:22:14.242
Good luck, Kimi.

01:22:44.742 --> 01:22:46.117
Go, Dylan!

01:22:48.909 --> 01:22:51.617
The rules remain the same.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.909
You will have 90 seconds
to complete your plane.

01:22:55.992 --> 01:23:00.159
This time, we will electronically
measure the distance.

01:23:15.242 --> 01:23:16.659
Sweet.

01:24:27.117 --> 01:24:28.992
Are you ready?

01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:59.492
You can do it! You can do it!
You can do it!

01:25:15.909 --> 01:25:19.242
45 seconds left!

01:25:46.075 --> 01:25:48.992
10 more seconds. Let's count down.

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:07.242
Stop there!

01:26:23.908 --> 01:26:26.658
Please take your positions.

01:26:39.158 --> 01:26:41.283
Please get ready.

01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:04.450
Come on, come on, come on.
You're almost there.

01:28:10.575 --> 01:28:13.158
I did it! Yeah!

01:28:31.075 --> 01:28:32.867
No!

01:28:33.033 --> 01:28:34.033
Yes!

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.533
It's amazing.

01:29:59.825 --> 01:30:02.658
Dad! Dad!

01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:11.616
It's beautiful.

01:30:12.116 --> 01:30:15.866
Yeah. I found my winged keel.
It was Clive.

01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:19.616
- Clive?
- Yeah. Clive.

01:30:19.741 --> 01:30:21.241
Okay.

01:30:28.908 --> 01:30:32.366
- Thanks, Dad.
- Good on ya, mate.

01:30:35.991 --> 01:30:37.950
You'll stick by me, yeah?

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:40.450
Yeah.

01:30:40.533 --> 01:30:42.325
For as long as it takes.

01:30:44.283 --> 01:30:45.866
I promise.

01:30:47.283 --> 01:30:49.866
We have the winners!

01:30:50.783 --> 01:30:52.658
Third place...

01:30:52.783 --> 01:30:55.783

Come on. Go and cheer
on your mates, mate.

01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:05.741

Dylan Webber!

01:31:39.741 --> 01:31:42.033
Bam!

01:31:44.783 --> 01:31:47.033
Congratulations.

01:31:47.908 --> 01:31:49.991
Thanks, mate.

01:32:22.283 --> 01:32:26.658
<i>There is beauty in the world
So much beauty in the world</i>

01:32:26.783 --> 01:32:30.783

<i>I see butterflies for us</i>

01:32:47.658 --> 01:32:50.616
<i>Listen to the sound</i>

01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:54.699
