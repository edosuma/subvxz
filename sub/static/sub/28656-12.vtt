00:01.566 --> 00:04.787
Previously onElementary...Hello, son. Joan.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.180
I've given a great measure
of thought

00:06.223 --> 00:08.356
to your Odin Reichenbach
problem.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.967
What do you want?My board wants me gone.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.143
I know your father's
the one behind it.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.406
Odin Reichenbach came
to see me at the precinct.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.235
Everything you've done,
it's working.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.716
I've already been summoned
to afternoon tea

00:20.759 --> 00:24.328
by an associate to discuss
the terms of repayment.

00:24.372 --> 00:28.245
You warned me the other day
that the world is changing.

00:28.289 --> 00:31.248
I fear it has
already changed.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.642
Sorry, old friend.

00:35.383 --> 00:36.514
BELL:
I just got a call

00:36.558 --> 00:38.647
from a buddy
in Queens North Homicide.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.823
He responded
to a body

00:40.866 --> 00:42.651
that was found out
in Willets Point.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.696
I'm so sorry, Sherlock.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.611
My father is dead.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.187
JOAN :
Sherlock.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.888
Sherlock.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.718
Sherlock, are you okay?

01:11.288 --> 01:15.814
I asked my father for help,
and now he's dead.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.338
He knew what he was
getting himself into.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.079
It's not your fault.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.954
Marcus is up to speed?
He knows about Odin Reichenbach?

01:24.997 --> 01:27.696
I told him everything.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.874
Do you know, uh...

01:33.571 --> 01:35.965
Did he suffer?

01:38.010 --> 01:39.490
That was the
Communications Section.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.710
I asked them to send
a patrol car to the house

01:41.753 --> 01:43.146
where you stashed that woman

01:43.190 --> 01:45.496
who was gonna testify
against Reichenbach.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.324
Turns out FDNY's already there.

01:47.368 --> 01:48.847
It's burning to the ground.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.849
Annie and Morland's men.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.591
No one's been able to get inside
to check for bodies yet, but...

01:56.333 --> 01:59.641
I think we have to assume he
found out about Miss Spellman

01:59.684 --> 02:01.512
and where you were hiding her.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.559
He must have gotten up on comms
for your dad's security detail.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.735
Now four more people are dead.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.739
Odin did this because
he wants to make himself

02:10.782 --> 02:12.219
less vulnerable
to our investigation,

02:12.262 --> 02:14.221
but I think he might have
just done the opposite.

02:14.264 --> 02:17.789
He keeps straying further
and further from his script.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.749
He's no longer just
using misguided people

02:20.792 --> 02:22.185
to commit preemptive hits.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.231
He's-he's using
trained professionals now.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.406
You sure about that?

02:25.449 --> 02:26.929
We were already
thinking he used pros

02:26.972 --> 02:28.104
to kill the Conrad family

02:28.148 --> 02:29.932
to make it look like
a murder-suicide,

02:29.975 --> 02:32.239
but everything that's happened
tonight pretty much seals it.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.371
I mean, there's no way
a bunch of amateurs would have

02:34.415 --> 02:35.590
gotten the drop
on Morland's men.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.374
In our experience,

02:37.418 --> 02:39.898
Odin's zealots are
very difficult to turn.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.944
They truly believe in
what they're doing.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.164
But...

02:44.207 --> 02:46.253
...assassins-for-hire,
on the other hand...

02:46.296 --> 02:47.950
They're just in it
for the money.

02:47.993 --> 02:51.127
Mm-hmm.We get the goods on them,
get 'em to flip...

02:51.171 --> 02:52.346
We'll have Odin.

02:53.651 --> 02:57.264
First things first, I suppose.

02:57.307 --> 03:00.049
You said my father was
at Willets Point.

03:04.009 --> 03:07.796
Well, I'd like
to see him.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.803
That's the vehicle there.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.935
They left him in
the passenger side.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.851
Door was wide open.
They wanted him found.

03:19.895 --> 03:23.115
Passerby saw him,
called it in.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.339
In case there was any doubt,
that's not my father's car.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.820
We know. It's registered
to a lady in Flushing.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.691
She reported it
stolen yesterday.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.477
Gotta figure this was all
planned out in advance.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.261
You said the neighborhood's
already being canvassed?

03:38.305 --> 03:39.697
BELL:
So far, no witnesses.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.395
CSU is still working,

03:41.438 --> 03:45.094
but maybe by now, they've
turned up something we can use.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.272
Sherlock, stay here, man.

03:49.316 --> 03:53.102
Let us go over there.
Let us check out the scene.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.887
No, I want to do this.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.868
Marcus, will you tell CSU
to get away from the car?

04:21.043 --> 04:22.871
Hey, guys?
We need the scene.

04:22.914 --> 04:25.352
Just for a minute, okay?Once they've come past you,

04:25.395 --> 04:27.441
I want you and Watson to follow.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.965
Of course, man.
Whatever you need.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.227
No, you misunderstand.
We're being watched.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.837
I just... I want them to think

04:32.881 --> 04:35.318
I'm taking a moment
to compose myself.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.798
What are you talking about?

04:36.841 --> 04:38.452
HOLMES: Look at the car
door-- the open one.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.975
One of the screws
is scuffed.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.412
Two of them have been replaced
with new ones.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.458
Someone took it apart recently,
put it back together again.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.024
Okay.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.591
They were counting on Watson
and me coming through here,

04:47.635 --> 04:48.766
so they filled it with ex...

05:15.706 --> 05:18.143
Then get more people down there.
I want every building

05:18.187 --> 05:21.233
with a direct line of sight
to that crime scene searched.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.974
Captain?

05:23.018 --> 05:26.630
Just get it done.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.676
Sherlock.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.723
I'm-I'm so sorry.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.030
My father had more enemies
than any man alive,

05:35.073 --> 05:36.988
but we all know
who's responsible, correct?

05:37.032 --> 05:41.341
Well, the fire at the house
where you had Annie Spellman

05:41.384 --> 05:43.255
makes it pretty damn clear.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.692
Odin Reichenbach.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.389
We heard there were
four bodies recovered.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.043
One female, three males.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.567
Hawes was able to use dental
records to I.D. Miss Spellman.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.047
The others are gonna
take a while.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.831
BELL: Well, if it
weren't for Sherlock,

05:53.875 --> 05:56.834
Hawes would probably be trying
to identify us today, too.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.096
That bomb last night.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.663
If we'd gotten any closer...

05:59.707 --> 06:02.492
Like the murders of my father
and Miss Spellman,

06:02.536 --> 06:04.320
we think it's the work
of professionals.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.061
Odin is hiring real talent now.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.932
WATSON: We think this
could be a break.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.457
There's got to be a financial
link between him and them.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.719
BELL: I'm going to start
digging into that

06:11.762 --> 06:13.155
while these two go
over what's left

06:13.198 --> 06:15.375
of the car that
got blown up.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.289
You two-- you don't
go anywhere now

06:17.333 --> 06:18.943
without a protective detail.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.250
If Odin Reichenbach wants to
take another swing at you,

06:21.293 --> 06:22.817
he's gonna have to come
through us.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.779
Exactly. I'm glad the board
showed them their true colors.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.912
Gave me the chance to boot
the dull half.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.262
Oh, it's definitely their loss.
Especially when you hear...

06:33.305 --> 06:35.395
Mr. Reichenbach.
You got a minute?

06:35.438 --> 06:38.006
Captain Tom Gregson.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.487
Don, I'll call you back.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.923
We've never met,

06:41.966 --> 06:45.013
but we have a friend
in common: Patrick Meers.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.885
Could you wait for me
inside, please?

06:50.453 --> 06:51.846
I'm confused, Captain.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.022
Is there something I can
do to help the NYPD?

06:54.065 --> 06:56.590
Yeah, you can stop
killing people.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.244
Did I get it wrong?

06:59.288 --> 07:01.333
Are you not the guy
who has people executed

07:01.377 --> 07:03.684
when you don't like
what you see in their e-mails

07:03.727 --> 07:05.250
and search histories?

07:05.294 --> 07:09.211
I see Sherlock Holmes has shared
his pet theory with you.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.735
I got scar tissue on my lungs

07:11.779 --> 07:14.085
that says it's more
than a theory.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.827
You managed to keep it
secret a long time,

07:16.871 --> 07:21.049
but I'm here to tell you
those days are over.

07:21.092 --> 07:24.226
Perhaps you'd rather speak
with one of my attorneys.

07:24.269 --> 07:27.403
This is an active
police investigation now.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.057
There's nothing you can do
to stop that.

07:29.100 --> 07:33.888
So, word to the wise,
stay away from my people.

07:35.759 --> 07:39.937
Did you know that I'm
a mathematician by training?

07:39.981 --> 07:41.591
When I was at university,
we were taught

07:41.635 --> 07:43.898
there are some problems
that have no solution.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.465
They don't add up.
They can't.

07:45.508 --> 07:49.556
If I believed that,
I never would have gotten here.

07:49.599 --> 07:54.822
Every problem has a solution,
Captain.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.708
You doing all right?

08:11.752 --> 08:13.275
Yeah.

08:15.799 --> 08:20.325
It probably helps that
I never liked my father.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.544
He was distant and cold.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.634
He was strange.

08:24.678 --> 08:25.766
Turned his back on my mother

08:25.809 --> 08:27.507
when she struggled
with addiction.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.074
And Mycroft
and I were just

08:30.118 --> 08:31.989
a distraction to
him after that.

08:34.557 --> 08:39.344
But when I looked at him,
I saw a... giant.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.870
All-powerful.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.787
I know that's not
uncommon for a son

08:46.830 --> 08:50.442
to think about his
father, but...

08:50.486 --> 08:54.142
in my case, it was true.

08:57.928 --> 09:00.365
You just don't
expect a titan

09:00.409 --> 09:06.154
to be caught unawares,
to be... brought low.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.462
Was that a watch?

09:10.506 --> 09:13.465
The guts of one.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.119
Given the severity
of the damage,

09:15.163 --> 09:17.992
it must have been close to
the center of the explosion.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.647
I didn't think the bomb
had a timer.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.126
It most definitely
did not.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.346
The bomb was triggered
as we moved away.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.089
So he must have
been wearing this.

09:33.747 --> 09:36.140
Yeah. See?

09:36.184 --> 09:37.968
Yeah.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.492
HOLMES:
Well, that's not his.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.059
This is junk.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.148
My father wore
his father's Patek.

09:44.192 --> 09:46.890
A 1937 Calatrava.
A classic.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.588
This is mass-produced.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.503
This is not the inner workings
of a $100,000 antique.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.724
So, you think they stole his?

09:54.768 --> 09:56.683
Perhaps they thought
it was a shame

09:56.726 --> 10:00.600
blowing up a six-figure score,
and just switched it.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.515
The person who took it,
if he tries to sell it...

10:03.559 --> 10:05.430
We might be able
to identify him.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.090
Afternoon.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.744
Marcus Bell. NYPD.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.355
I was hoping to talk
to the owner.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.662
That's my uncle.
He lives in Mumbai.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.621
Is there something
I can help you with?

10:21.664 --> 10:25.015
Uh, my colleagues and I, we're
visiting all the authorized

10:25.059 --> 10:27.104
Patek repairmen
in the tristate area.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.019
We need help with a
homicide investigation.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.847
No joke?

10:30.891 --> 10:33.633
Fancy watch was stolen.
Owner got killed.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.547
We think the perp
will try to move it.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.288
At least, we're hoping.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.117
Only so many people plugged into
the aftermarket for Pateks.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.641
I'm not one of them.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.251
This is a clean shop.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.469
Well, I'm not accusing you.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.907
It's just,

10:46.950 --> 10:48.909
the guy we're looking for,
he won't necessarily know

10:48.952 --> 10:51.259
who plays ball and who doesn't.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.087
All I'm asking
is that you give us a call

10:53.130 --> 10:55.655
if anyone comes around
asking questions

10:55.698 --> 10:57.961
about this particular watch.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.964
It's a Patek
Calatrava, 1937.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.490
I've seen this watch before.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.579
A guy was just in here
asking about it.

11:07.623 --> 11:10.147
Today?An hour ago.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.672
He showed it to me,
said he inherited it.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.499
Wanted to make sure the
parts were all original.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.023
Told him I'd rather
not open it up

11:16.066 --> 11:18.286
till I could track
down the manual.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.462
Too expensive to
mess up, you know?

11:20.505 --> 11:21.768
He was probably hoping
you could show him

11:21.811 --> 11:24.161
all the parts
with identifying numbers inside.

11:24.205 --> 11:28.383
Oh, he, uh, gave me
his name and number.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.733
Here.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.476
This is the guy who
brought your dad's watch

11:34.519 --> 11:36.783
into the store:
Kent Hawley.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.263
He runs a bowling
alley in Hoboken.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.917
He's got priors for mail fraud

11:40.961 --> 11:43.354
and importing stolen goods,
but far as we can tell,

11:43.398 --> 11:45.095
he's behaved himself
the past 15 years.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.358
Well, I'm gonna venture
a guess that that man is not

11:47.402 --> 11:48.925
one of the contract killers
that bested

11:48.969 --> 11:50.318
my father's security team.

11:50.361 --> 11:51.798
Not with a broken leg.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.190
Not if he was
the picture of health.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.670
I didn't like him for
an assassin, either,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.019
and yet...

11:56.063 --> 11:57.629
He had Morland's watch.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.457
I started wondering
who his friends are,

11:59.501 --> 12:01.285
so I dug into his
social media.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.418
Check out his
brother-in-law.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.507
Well, he looks
more like the type.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.291
BELL:
He's exactly the type.

12:07.335 --> 12:10.512
Name's Jacob Webb.
He's 38, former Army Ranger.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.514
He's been contracting
for private military companies

12:12.557 --> 12:14.211
the past six years.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.909
Mercenary?

12:15.952 --> 12:17.998
These days, he's back and forth
from Iraq and Kazakhstan

12:18.041 --> 12:20.043
for a company called
Alliance Fortas.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.610
I had the lab check.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.481
The RDX used in
the car bomb

12:23.525 --> 12:25.527
is consistent
with a batch

12:25.570 --> 12:27.964
sold to Alliance
Fortas last year.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.619
Well, I think I'll pay Mr. Webb
a visit and introduce myself.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.316
You're going to have
to get in line.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.796
The chemical match

12:33.840 --> 12:35.232
and his connection
to your dad's watch

12:35.276 --> 12:36.712
were enough to
get a warrant.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.541
ESU's on their way to
his place right now.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.108
Move, move, move!

12:41.151 --> 12:43.327
Give me two, give me two.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.332
Car's in the garage.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.987
Master's clear.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.076
First floor is secure.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.686
Rear entry is locked.

12:55.818 --> 12:56.776
We're empty here.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.824
I'm not seeing anybody.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.521
Upstairs clear.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.133
Guys, I know his
car is outside,

13:06.176 --> 13:07.395
but I don't think
anybody's home.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.876
Copy that.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.752
Neighbor says she saw Webb
coming here

13:16.796 --> 13:18.536
with three friends this morning.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.843
Maybe they were
the other members of his team.

13:20.887 --> 13:24.586
If they were, maybe they saw
ESU coming, snuck out the back.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.153
I don't think so.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.155
ESU had this place covered
from all directions.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.591
If Webb and his buddies left,

13:29.634 --> 13:31.593
they did it
before any of us got here.

13:31.636 --> 13:35.858
So maybe Odin realized that
you were looking into Webb,

13:35.902 --> 13:38.382
told him to run.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.254
I didn't use any
Odker software.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.864
Then how did they know to leave?

13:41.908 --> 13:44.214
HOLMES:
Actually, only one
of them knew to leave.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.738
Other three are still here.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.220
The neighbor.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.527
She said there was a fire
going this morning.

13:52.570 --> 13:55.225
HOLMES: There was indeed.
Right here in this oven.

13:55.269 --> 13:58.054
One of the four men who came
here killed the other three,

13:58.098 --> 14:00.056
and then burned them.

14:07.368 --> 14:10.371
Here we've got Jacob Webb,
owner of the home you raided.

14:10.414 --> 14:15.115
This one's Anders Kashuv,
and this is Martin Stahl,

14:15.158 --> 14:17.465
give or take
a fibula or a rib.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.771
They were all dismembered before
they were put in the oven,

14:19.815 --> 14:21.251
so I'm still doing some sorting.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.340
I'm surprised
you got I.D.'s so quick.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.777
Dental records
and prelim DNA testing.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.779
Helps that they were all
in the system.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.477
Everybody here
is former military.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.000
WATSON:
Well, it looks like

14:31.044 --> 14:32.393
they were all
executed with

14:32.436 --> 14:33.742
the same caliber gun,
nine-millimeter?

14:33.785 --> 14:35.744
GSWs in each of
the parietal bones

14:35.787 --> 14:37.615
came in at the same angle.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.966
If I had to guess, he
put them on their knees

14:40.009 --> 14:42.403
and went down the line,
execution-style.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.318
Good guess.
We found three bullet holes

14:44.361 --> 14:45.928
in the downstairs bathroom.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.539
Figure he hacked them up there,
cleaned up with bleach.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.932
Grisly but not
particularly painful end

14:49.976 --> 14:52.543
for three
of my father's killers.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.197
Better than they deserved.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.634
I still can't believe you guys
want to connect this back

14:56.678 --> 14:58.419
to Odin Reichenbach.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.856
Guy made my phone,
for crying out loud.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.163
You don't have that on
you right now, do you?

15:03.206 --> 15:05.687
Sure, I do.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.822
Let's see him eavesdrop
through that.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.086
You really went
above and beyond here, Eugene.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.437
Never seen an M.E.'s report
with news clippings on the vics.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.829
Special case.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.135
I ran the names online.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.484
Don't worry, I used Google.

15:20.528 --> 15:23.226
Thought I'd give you
some extra background.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.141
Turns out these guys
all worked together.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.100
They were mercenaries
for a company called Agrianos.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.753
WATSON:
Well, it says here

15:28.797 --> 15:30.581
that Agrianos went belly-up
three years ago.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.409
Got sued out of existence.

15:32.453 --> 15:35.325
Odin somehow reassembled
this particular team.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.849
Wouldn't be surprised if he used
them to kill the Conrad family

15:37.893 --> 15:39.329
and Annie Spellman, too.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.636
When they missed us
with that car bomb,

15:41.679 --> 15:43.507
they must have disappointed
their employer.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.335
And now here they lie.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.163
Question I had was,
who gets the drop

15:47.207 --> 15:48.991
on three professional soldiers?

15:49.035 --> 15:51.254
Bunch of trained killers
hanging out in this guy's house;

15:51.298 --> 15:53.126
next thing you know, they're
getting shoved into an oven?

15:53.169 --> 15:54.170
WATSON:
Jacob Webb's neighbor said

15:54.214 --> 15:55.998
she saw a fourth man.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.479
Chances are he was another
member of their team.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.872
Think we better learn a little
more about the merc company

16:00.916 --> 16:02.874
they worked for.
Don't you?

16:02.918 --> 16:05.007
If you two wouldn't mind
taking the lead,

16:05.051 --> 16:08.228
I have some family business
to attend to.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.623
McNALLY: So, you gonna
tell me how your day was?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.670
Yeah, it was good.Well, how was it good?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.412
Well, who'd you play
with at recess?

16:18.455 --> 16:19.848
Other kids.

16:19.891 --> 16:23.330
You know, Jess,
getting answers out of al-Qaeda

16:23.373 --> 16:25.593
is easier than getting
answers out of you.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.421
I don't know who that is.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.466
Never m...

16:31.468 --> 16:33.949
Hey, honey, why don't you just

16:33.993 --> 16:35.777
wait here,
just for a second,

16:35.820 --> 16:37.344
where I can see you.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.521
I have to go talk to an
old friend of mine for a minute.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.566
Okay.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.445
My daughter's school. Really?

16:51.488 --> 16:53.621
I'm sorry, are we leaving
families out of it now?

16:53.664 --> 16:54.970
She's a child.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.798
And I would never hurt her.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.496
That's the difference
between me and your new friends.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.065
Look, I know why you're upset.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.024
I heard about your father.Oh, you heard?

17:05.067 --> 17:07.896
I was in Washington all week.
I got in last night.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.159
You want to see my ticket stubs?

17:10.203 --> 17:13.075
This whole thing has gotten
completely out of hand.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.598
I was not consulted.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.470
Am I to believe
that you would have counseled

17:16.513 --> 17:18.298
Mr. Reichenbach differently?

17:18.341 --> 17:21.214
The last time we met, you
threatened everyone close to me.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.042
I didn't threaten you.
I warned you

17:23.085 --> 17:25.044
what could happen if you
went against the grain.

17:25.087 --> 17:28.134
Well, then let me repay the
favor with a warning of my own.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.875
Odin Reichenbach is a problem
about to be solved.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.181
You can help,

17:32.225 --> 17:34.227
or you can suffer the same fate.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.711
All right.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.366
Well, enjoy your last days
with your daughter.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.760
She'll be visiting you in prison
soon enough.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.073
You need anything, Mr. Wentz?

17:54.116 --> 17:57.728
Oh, just patience.

17:57.772 --> 18:01.123
Sorry. I've been moving
pretty slowly these days.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.389
Doctors wish I'd stop
moving altogether and rest.

18:06.433 --> 18:10.872
But I tell them, uh,
that's gonna happen soon enough.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.701
You said on the phone it was...

18:13.744 --> 18:15.746
Uh, pancreatic. Yeah.

18:15.790 --> 18:19.228
Um, chemo's slowing it down
a little, but, uh...

18:19.272 --> 18:23.232
the over/under is a month.

18:25.408 --> 18:29.325
So, now that I'm here, you want
to tell me what you got cooking?

18:29.369 --> 18:30.805
We're looking
for someone

18:30.848 --> 18:32.676
who recently carried out

18:32.720 --> 18:34.809
multiple homicides
here in the city.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.202
We think you may know him.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.160
A serial killer?

18:38.204 --> 18:40.162
A professional.

18:40.206 --> 18:43.383
Jacob Webb, Anders
Kashuv, Marty Stahl.

18:43.426 --> 18:44.645
You know them, right?

18:44.688 --> 18:47.213
You're talking about Agrianos.

18:49.737 --> 18:52.305
How much do you know
about my business with them?

18:52.348 --> 18:54.176
Just what was in the news.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.873
You hired
a private military company

18:55.917 --> 18:59.877
to help you secure energy rights
in Nigeria a few years back.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.575
They did their job,

19:01.618 --> 19:03.185
a little too thoroughly.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.882
A lot of people died.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.841
I didn't approve any of that.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.582
Yeah, I know what
the plea deal said,

19:08.625 --> 19:10.584
but I'm telling you the truth.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.848
I was going bankrupt.
I couldn't fight it anymore.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.067
Look, I'm not asking you
to relitigate the whole thing.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.896
We just want to know more
about Agrianos.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.293
The company went kaput.
Out of business.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.121
Owner went to Australia.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.993
All the people
scattered to the wind.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.604
Well, the three I mentioned

19:30.647 --> 19:32.997
landed in the same spot
this week.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.956
Jacob Webb's brick oven.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.787
All three of their names

19:39.830 --> 19:42.833
were reported in articles
about the Nigeria scandal,

19:42.877 --> 19:46.620
but nobody else involved with
the company was ever mentioned.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.187
We're having trouble
tracking down

19:48.230 --> 19:50.319
a single living soul
linked to Agrianos.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.974
WATSON:
You might remember they
destroyed their records

19:53.017 --> 19:54.976
rather than submit to discovery
in that lawsuit.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.674
There's no way for us to
find out who else they employed.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.546
BELL:
We were hoping
you might be able

19:59.589 --> 20:01.243
to provide us
with some names,

20:01.287 --> 20:03.158
people these guys worked with.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.160
Why?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.729
Because we think one of their
old running buddies did this.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.385
These guys are terrifying.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.517
You see that, don't you?

20:14.561 --> 20:17.303
More terrifying
than pancreatic cancer?

20:19.348 --> 20:22.656
They can't kill me twice.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.745
That's your point, right?

20:35.103 --> 20:37.105
Right down here, sir.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.635
You wait here.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.944
Two people just posted
on one of your websites

20:49.987 --> 20:52.076
they just saw you
jogging this trail.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.730
Well, what can I say about this

20:53.774 --> 20:56.211
interconnected world
we all inhabit?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.778
I live in a gilded cage
of my own making.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.040
It has its drawbacks.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.694
Well, maybe if you make
another $10 billion,

21:00.737 --> 21:02.565
you can finally afford
to invest in a hat.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.264
You're tense, Agent McNally.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.440
Yeah, I am. Sherlock Holmes
was waiting for me

21:07.483 --> 21:09.442
and my daughter
outside her school.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.619
Is that why you called
this meeting, to complain?

21:12.662 --> 21:15.274
Look, I know you may not be
used to having partners,

21:15.317 --> 21:17.537
but no matter what you may
think, Odker is not bigger

21:17.580 --> 21:19.539
than the NSA,
and we are not happy.

21:19.582 --> 21:20.931
Neither am I.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.325
But you know what won't
fix things? Meetings.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.936
I know you bureaucratic types
have an affinity for them,

21:25.980 --> 21:27.764
but I prefer to act.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.331
Yeah, well, it may be
getting a little late

21:29.375 --> 21:30.898
for either of us
to do much of that.

21:30.941 --> 21:34.336
I've been following the list
of people investigating you.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.295
It's growing
longer and longer.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.993
The NYPD is ready to pitch
a tent on your front lawn.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.429
Well, I'm monitoring that.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.083
Oh, you're monitoring
that. Great.

21:42.126 --> 21:45.565
Look, all the police have
are theories.

21:45.608 --> 21:48.307
In order to prove any of them,
they need data.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.353
Data that you control.
So I like our chances.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.094
But you're right,
our joint program

21:53.137 --> 21:54.748
has reached
an inflection point.

21:54.791 --> 21:58.012
You can't deny me any longer.
Not if I'm going to survive.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.449
We've been through this.
I am not authorized to grant...

22:00.493 --> 22:02.190
I need it.

22:02.233 --> 22:05.019
I need to see what is
on every platform.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.369
Not just Odker.
Every mail system.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.589
Everything the NSA
has access to.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.679
It is the only way
that I can be sure

22:12.722 --> 22:15.203
I will see every threat coming.

22:15.246 --> 22:18.380
And not just against me.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.382
Because our fates
are intertwined now.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.211
Or is that not the point
Mr. Holmes was making today?

22:23.254 --> 22:25.518
I can ask.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.694
Then do it.

22:27.737 --> 22:31.262
And be persuasive.

22:33.917 --> 22:38.400
Hello?
You guys down here?

22:38.444 --> 22:40.054
Pizza came.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.882
I didn't order any food.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.100
It's okay. I did.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.232
It's not
an assassination attempt.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.060
Thanks, Detective.

22:46.103 --> 22:49.977
Well, that's good, 'cause I,
uh, tested it for poison.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.413
Thank you for keeping us safe.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.981
W-Would you mind returning
to your post?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.988
These leads are terrible.
We need better leads.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.294
The Glengarry leads?

23:03.338 --> 23:05.253
Not one of the names
that you gave me,

23:05.296 --> 23:07.255
that Frederick Wentz gave you,
is a promising suspect.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.039
Two of them are dead,
and the others

23:09.083 --> 23:11.433
are working on private
military contracts overseas.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.828
I'm frustrated.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.047
The man we're looking for
has meted out

23:17.091 --> 23:19.485
some of the punishment
that by rights is ours to give.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.008
Now it seems
our list

23:21.051 --> 23:22.923
of suspects is wanting.

23:22.966 --> 23:26.579
Actually, I'm not
so sure about that.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.015
There's something on your half
of the list?

23:28.058 --> 23:29.582
So, most of it
looks just like yours.

23:29.625 --> 23:32.106
Plenty of untimely deaths
and morally repulsive alibis.

23:32.149 --> 23:35.109
But this last guy might
be who we're looking for.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.850
"Levi Chait"?

23:36.893 --> 23:38.634
He used to work
for Mossad.

23:38.678 --> 23:41.071
And then he got started
as a merc in 2012

23:41.115 --> 23:43.509
working for Agrianos
and a few other companies.

23:43.552 --> 23:44.945
I'm pretty sure he teamed up

23:44.988 --> 23:47.034
with Webb and Kashuv
once before.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.863
They were supposedly providing
security for a sheikh,

23:49.906 --> 23:51.908
but the government there
thought they were really sent

23:51.952 --> 23:53.736
to assassinate the Bahraini
defense minister.

23:53.780 --> 23:56.173
If you're going to send a
hit squad, you'd send one

23:56.217 --> 23:58.219
which has worked
together before.Exactly.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.395
The problem is, this Chait guy
is gonna be hard to find.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.310
He's a ghost.We wouldn't
go it alone.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.094
We have the NYPD issue an APB.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.487
I thought
the same thing,

24:05.531 --> 24:07.576
but it's kind of hard
to look out for someone

24:07.620 --> 24:09.360
when you don't know
what they look like.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.624
I couldn't find a verified photo
of him anywhere online.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.495
There is this, though.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.106
You think one of these men
might be Chait?

24:16.150 --> 24:17.630
It's from a hunting
message board.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.849
It's the only place
where his name popped up online.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.938
If the guy on the site
is the Levi Chait

24:21.982 --> 24:23.505
that we're looking for,

24:23.549 --> 24:26.334
then he hunts with the men
in this picture.

24:26.377 --> 24:28.771
Only one of them
wasn't captioned.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.208
Frederick Wentz should be able
to confirm whether it's him.

24:31.252 --> 24:33.646
Eat some pizza,
get some rest.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.648
Pretty soon, we might have
someone who can testify

24:35.691 --> 24:39.042
against Odin Reichenbach.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.742
WATSON:
Levi Chait.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.092
You gave us the name.
Is that him or not?

24:45.135 --> 24:46.920
I don't know.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.226
I-I remember the
name, not the face.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.881
You're sure he did this?

24:51.925 --> 24:53.753
No, we're not sure.
We'd like to talk to Mr. Chait,

24:53.796 --> 24:55.276
but we need to know
what he looks like

24:55.319 --> 24:57.104
if we're gonna
track him down.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.888
If you're hesitating
because the hair

24:58.932 --> 25:00.629
or beard are different,
just let us know.

25:00.673 --> 25:03.502
We can always alter an image
which goes out with an APB.

25:03.545 --> 25:07.636
Uh, you got to understand
that this was a few years ago.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.638
There were a lot of these
guys coming and going.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.901
Ah, damn it.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.773
Sorry.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.734
Mr. Wentz, we just can't

25:18.778 --> 25:20.954
get it flowing
today, can we?

25:20.997 --> 25:24.044
Bear with me, hon, we're gonna
have to try the other arm.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.220
Oh, could you just, uh,
give us a minute?

25:26.263 --> 25:29.049
Yeah, give us a minute.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.183
It's a burn.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.098
It's no more than
a couple of days old.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.231
Certainly not
from radiation therapy.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.668
Tell us you didn't get it

25:39.712 --> 25:41.365
stuffing pieces
of your employees

25:41.409 --> 25:43.585
into Jacob Webb's
outdoor oven.

25:44.804 --> 25:46.936
Two days?
That-that was Wednesday.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.025
I get chemotherapy on Wednesday.

25:49.069 --> 25:51.027
WATSON:
There's no record
of you being here.

25:51.071 --> 25:54.074
In fact, you haven't been here
for the past couple of weeks.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.945
No, he's been busy.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.469
So how did
Odin find you?

25:58.513 --> 26:00.080
How much
is he paying you?

26:00.123 --> 26:01.560
WATSON:
After they missed us
with that bomb,

26:01.603 --> 26:03.779
he must have asked you
to get rid of them.

26:03.823 --> 26:07.653
Make sure nothing
could spill back on him.

26:07.696 --> 26:10.351
Do we have it about right?

26:11.091 --> 26:14.616
I suppose I could tell you,
but why would I?

26:14.660 --> 26:17.576
Like your, uh,
cop friend said,

26:17.619 --> 26:19.578
I'll be dead in a month.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.407
I'd rather talk
to a lawyer.

26:29.805 --> 26:33.026
Look, I wish I had better news,
but these homicide charges

26:33.069 --> 26:35.202
you want to file
against Frederick Wentz--

26:35.245 --> 26:36.507
there is no way

26:36.551 --> 26:38.161
the district attorney's office
can pursue them.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.468
That's ridiculous. Your office
prosecutes murderers every day.

26:40.511 --> 26:41.991
It's your raison d'être.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.254
Yeah, I'm well aware
of our charter.

26:44.298 --> 26:47.649
I'm also aware that Mr. Wentz is
suffering from terminal cancer.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.651
That shouldn't matter.
He killed three people.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.653
People you say
were murderers themselves.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.350
Contracted by
Odin Reichenbach

26:53.394 --> 26:56.527
to keep a program
of preemptive assassination

26:56.571 --> 26:58.007
from coming to light.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.618
Two wrongs make a right?

26:59.661 --> 27:01.620
I didn't realize
they updated

27:01.663 --> 27:03.317
New York State penal law.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.927
Not what I'm saying.

27:04.971 --> 27:07.190
I'm saying that these
are explosive allegations,

27:07.234 --> 27:08.844
and Wentz has
already lawyered up.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.585
How do you imagine
a bankrupt pariah

27:10.629 --> 27:12.282
has retained the services
of the city's

27:12.326 --> 27:14.197
preeminent
criminal defense firm?

27:14.241 --> 27:15.590
Who do you
think is paying

27:15.634 --> 27:17.374
those white-shoe lawyers
to intimidate you?

27:17.418 --> 27:18.898
GREGSON:
He's right.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.900
Odin Reichenbach
is pulling the strings here.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.076
Yeah, well,
he's doing a hell of a job.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.252
Frederick Wentz
is our only living link

27:25.295 --> 27:28.037
to all the crimes
that Odin is responsible for.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.213
GREGSON:
We're talking about
a billionaire

27:30.257 --> 27:33.956
who's illegally spying on people
and then having them killed.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.265
How is that not a case you want
splashed all over the news?

27:38.308 --> 27:41.137
Tommy, you know you can't charge

27:41.181 --> 27:44.750
into that kind of battle
without any ammo.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.577
Wentz swears he's innocent

27:46.621 --> 27:49.406
and professes to have no
knowledge regarding the deaths

27:49.450 --> 27:52.105
of your father, Annie Spellman
or the Conrad family.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.455
He is not gonna cooperate.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.457
So that's it?

27:56.500 --> 27:59.503
This guy just takes
his secrets to the grave?

27:59.547 --> 28:01.114
I'm sorry.

28:01.157 --> 28:05.684
If Wentz is all you got,
you got nothing.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.256
HOLMES: I should have run

28:13.300 --> 28:14.605
directly at Odin Reichenbach

28:14.649 --> 28:16.564
when we found out
what he was doing.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.740
You didn't want anyone else
getting hurt.I was naive.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.003
All I did was give a ruthless
billionaire a head start,

28:21.047 --> 28:22.918
and now there's no way
to catch up.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.921
There has to be a link that ties
Odin to everything he's done.

28:25.965 --> 28:29.142
I mean, we're back
to where we started.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.100
No, our position
is considerably worse.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.275
He won't expose
his flank again

28:32.319 --> 28:33.886
now that we came this close.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.105
He knows there
are eyes on him now.

28:36.149 --> 28:39.326
Maybe. But it's got
to count for something

28:39.369 --> 28:41.676
that there are
so many eyes on him.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.591
Well, how can we compete?
He's omniscient.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.419
He's just gonna
keep killing people in ways

28:45.462 --> 28:47.813
that we can't foresee or detect.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.730
This was our only shot.

28:54.907 --> 28:57.431
There you are. They told
me you left the station.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.781
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

29:01.043 --> 29:05.352
I'm the only Holmes left now.

29:08.311 --> 29:11.140
I understand
if you'd rather be alone,

29:11.184 --> 29:13.839
but if you want to talk...

29:17.581 --> 29:20.019
There is something
we need to discuss.

29:22.021 --> 29:24.023
Privately.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.598
What is it?

29:37.688 --> 29:42.519
I've been having trouble
picturing what comes next.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.478
You need sleep. We both do.

29:44.521 --> 29:45.827
Tomorrow, we'll start again.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.307
We'll find something.
We always do.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.699
No.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.353
I know what needs to happen.

29:50.397 --> 29:53.748
I've just been trying to decide
if I'm up to it.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.882
What do you mean?

29:58.231 --> 30:00.929
We have to plan
a murder of our own.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.412
When you go back up,
tell Richard

30:05.455 --> 30:07.066
to keep his eye
on the Nikkei.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.155
If the stock goes up
less than three points,

30:09.198 --> 30:11.026
have him initiate
buyback protocol.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.419
I think that's everything.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.207
Is there something else?

30:18.251 --> 30:19.861
The imam in Dallas.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.341
I shouldn't even have
mentioned it.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.429
Probably not a good time.

30:22.472 --> 30:23.560
What is it?

30:23.604 --> 30:25.214
He and his brother bought guns.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.216
And he drafted a letter,
a farewell letter.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.565
He hasn't sent it, but...

30:28.609 --> 30:31.220
Take them both out.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.918
We've got a volunteer
on the ground, don't we?

30:32.961 --> 30:34.876
I thought we might want to keep
this sort of activity

30:34.920 --> 30:36.573
to a minimum,
given the level of scrutiny.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.184
No. Forget about that.

30:38.227 --> 30:40.229
Frederick Wentz
isn't gonna talk.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.275
The NYPD is out of luck,
and they know it.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.016
You should see what they're
saying in their e-mails.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.234
It's delicious.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.410
You're sure?Nothing stops.

30:47.454 --> 30:49.804
It's time to get up off the mat.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.937
Have you been sitting
on any other developments?

30:51.980 --> 30:54.896
Well, there have been a few.Then act,

30:54.940 --> 30:56.463
on all of them.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.421
We can't hide from
our responsibilities.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.423
No, sir, of course not.
There is one more thing.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.947
You'll see it
in your nightly brief.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.079
Agent McNally sent
a message this afternoon.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.298
He wants to talk.

31:05.341 --> 31:07.648
Details are all in here.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.825
In person. Always.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.262
Little paranoid, isn't he?Can you think
of a reason

31:13.306 --> 31:15.308
why he shouldn't be?

31:20.356 --> 31:22.837
Hey, I thought you went home.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.188
I did. Sherlock was there.
He was...

31:26.232 --> 31:27.363
What's wrong?

31:28.582 --> 31:30.410
Look, I tried to stop him.

31:30.453 --> 31:33.587
I need your help. He's about
to make a horrible mistake.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.857
Hey, Danny, pull the car over.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.120
Right here, sir?

31:45.164 --> 31:46.992
This bridge is the new spot,
I guess.

31:47.035 --> 31:49.516
I'm supposed to go alone.

31:49.559 --> 31:53.128
So just keep the car running,
all right?

32:35.344 --> 32:38.260
I see.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.960
Agent McNally's text...

32:42.003 --> 32:43.613
you sent it.

32:48.314 --> 32:51.795
Did you kill him?
No.

32:51.839 --> 32:55.103
I just broke into his car,
found his phone.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.801
It was easy enough to clone.

32:57.845 --> 33:02.197
Why don't you put that down?

33:02.241 --> 33:03.285
You don't believe
in guns.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.113
That's how we
both met, remember?

33:05.157 --> 33:07.246
Yeah, you shoveled some money
at the gun buyback program

33:07.289 --> 33:09.074
I started
in Watson's name.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.511
Back then, I thought we might
be kindred spirits.

33:11.554 --> 33:16.429
We're both aware of the danger
that these things represent.

33:16.472 --> 33:19.084
They make it too easy to...

33:19.127 --> 33:22.435
give in to one's base instincts,

33:22.478 --> 33:24.611
settle for a violent solution.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.439
So don't do that.

33:26.482 --> 33:29.703
Well, the thing is,

33:29.746 --> 33:32.923
some problems only have
a violent solution.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.667
I understand your frustrations.

33:37.711 --> 33:41.149
I know that I haven't
been fair with you,

33:41.193 --> 33:45.153
but we both know

33:45.197 --> 33:47.460
you're not gonna shoot me.

33:47.503 --> 33:49.375
Is that right?

33:49.418 --> 33:51.812
Course not.

33:51.855 --> 33:53.814
You're like me.

33:53.857 --> 33:57.731
A man of absolute
convictions.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.083
So what do you want?

34:02.127 --> 34:03.867
I'm not here to negotiate.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.565
I'm not trying to insult you.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.829
I know that money
won't move the needle.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.613
Nothing you can offer me will.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.660
We're the opposite poles
of a magnet.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.270
We're repellent to each other.

34:15.314 --> 34:18.578
Maybe you believe that,
but I don't.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.971
You trade freedom
for safety.

34:21.015 --> 34:23.670
You want to make that choice
for everyone.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.325
You want to turn
the social order upside down.

34:26.368 --> 34:29.241
You can't
justify murder

34:29.284 --> 34:31.591
by inductive inference.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.462
Course you can.

34:33.506 --> 34:36.204
People have to be free
to make their own choices

34:36.248 --> 34:39.599
and make their own mistakes,

34:39.642 --> 34:42.950
and then they have to live
with them.

34:42.993 --> 34:46.475
You're too focused on the past.

34:46.519 --> 34:48.782
Always trying to deduce
what's already happened.

34:48.825 --> 34:51.393
You can't see what's ahead.

34:53.395 --> 34:57.617
Your way, it's...

34:57.660 --> 34:59.793
it's almost over.

34:59.836 --> 35:01.795
I don't accept that.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.623
It's not up to you.

35:03.666 --> 35:06.626
If I'd killed
as many people as you have,

35:06.669 --> 35:08.671
I wouldn't want
to look back, either.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.111
Living with the past,

35:13.154 --> 35:16.375
that's what justice is.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.464
That's what this is.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.949
Is that them
on the walkway?

35:25.993 --> 35:28.126
They weren't supposed
to meet until 11:00.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.171
I can't tell.
We got to block traffic.

35:30.215 --> 35:33.043
Nobody else
gets in or out.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.137
OFFICER:
All right, fan out.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.969
No!

35:48.015 --> 35:50.148
Sherlock!
Put the gun down!

35:59.722 --> 36:01.637
I didn't mean to!
I had no choice!

36:01.681 --> 36:06.033
Drop it! Drop it!
Put the gun down!

36:06.076 --> 36:09.341
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

36:22.310 --> 36:26.836
OFFICER:
Marcus? Hey, Marcus.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.273
It's been six hours.

36:28.316 --> 36:31.711
Scuba team says they got to
start staggering shifts.

36:31.754 --> 36:33.103
Water temp's
pretty low,

36:33.147 --> 36:35.802
and their people aren't
supposed to stay in so long.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.891
Still nothing down there?

36:41.590 --> 36:44.245
Tell them to call the
Coast Guard and ask for help.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.030
Get everyone
you can think of down here.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.250
It's one of our people
who went in.

37:03.786 --> 37:06.224
Your lawyer's on his way.

37:08.269 --> 37:12.055
Thought we might talk for
a minute before he gets here.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.797
No, thanks.
Fine.

37:14.841 --> 37:16.756
Don't talk.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.848
You can listen.

37:21.891 --> 37:24.198
We're charging you with murder
in the first degree.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.946
I didn't think
you'd be that stupid.

37:32.989 --> 37:36.123
You don't think
we can make it stick?

37:37.646 --> 37:39.300
I already told your men--
I was lured

37:39.344 --> 37:40.780
to the bridge
under false pretenses.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.303
I was confronted by a madman.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.349
I managed to pry
his gun away from him,

37:44.392 --> 37:46.612
and I used it to defend myself.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.571
His partner said you
invited him out there.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.921
Well, she's lying.
She's probably in on it.

37:51.965 --> 37:55.751
We've got a gun
that was purchased

37:55.795 --> 37:59.364
by a program
that you funded.

37:59.407 --> 38:03.542
I think we can show
premeditation.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.415
Maybe I'm wrong.

38:10.940 --> 38:14.204
But here's what I do know.

38:14.248 --> 38:18.208
You killed a good man tonight.

38:18.252 --> 38:22.038
You killed my friend.

38:22.082 --> 38:25.259
And you killed
quite a few bad people

38:25.303 --> 38:28.088
these past
few months, too.

38:29.829 --> 38:34.050
Maybe a few were
somewhere in between.

38:34.094 --> 38:36.270
This is all gonna come out.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.056
For a man who's so experienced
in the criminal justice system,

38:40.100 --> 38:44.104
you have some powerful delusions
about how it works.

38:44.147 --> 38:46.715
I'm a billionaire,
Captain.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.761
I defended
myself tonight

38:48.804 --> 38:51.154
against a drug-addicted
obsessive.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.243
You're wasting your time.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.855
Stick to that story.

38:58.031 --> 39:02.078
Maybe you'll beat
the murder case,

39:02.122 --> 39:04.472
but we are going
to court,

39:04.516 --> 39:08.346
and there will
be discovery,

39:08.389 --> 39:12.001
and that's gonna lead
to more problems for you.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.917
What do you think our theory
of the motive's gonna be?

39:14.961 --> 39:17.093
You killed Sherlock
to keep him from talking,

39:17.137 --> 39:19.531
from telling the world
what you are.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.447
That's the play, then.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.405
You're going fishing.

39:24.449 --> 39:28.714
You know, Sherlock didn't come
to us about you for a long time.

39:28.757 --> 39:32.935
He didn't want to see
anyone else get hurt.

39:32.979 --> 39:36.722
But in the end,

39:36.765 --> 39:39.594
he trusted me.

39:43.511 --> 39:46.601
So...

39:46.645 --> 39:48.690
I know exactly

39:48.734 --> 39:52.041
what secrets you were hoping
to keep on that bridge tonight.

39:52.085 --> 39:56.263
And you can hire all
the lawyers in the world,

39:56.306 --> 39:58.265
and it's not gonna work,

39:58.308 --> 40:02.922
'cause we're gonna tear your
company apart, piece by piece,

40:02.965 --> 40:05.577
until we find the proof
that Sherlock was right.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.274
And it's there.

40:07.317 --> 40:12.366
In all the ones and zeroes
under your thumb, it's there.

40:18.677 --> 40:21.419
You and I agree
on one thing.

40:21.462 --> 40:25.074
When you know
you're looking at a killer,

40:25.118 --> 40:27.555
you got to stop him.

40:50.230 --> 40:52.493
Divers are still looking.

40:52.537 --> 40:56.671
You saw how much of his blood
was on the bridge.

40:59.326 --> 41:02.068
Reichenbach is still swearing
up and down he was ambushed.

41:02.111 --> 41:05.375
Sherlock lured him there,
not the other way around.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.118
What are you saying?

41:09.162 --> 41:12.470
Sherlock's father's dead
'cause of this guy.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.994
If what happened tonight
was revenge,

41:15.037 --> 41:18.650
if Sherlock really was taking
matters into his own hands,

41:18.693 --> 41:21.653
better we know now than later.

41:24.351 --> 41:27.223
It's been a long night.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.356
I'm gonna head home.
