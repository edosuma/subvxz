00:22.989 --> 00:25.617
The fact is, KITT is gone
and we've got to get him back.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.319
You control the car,
don't you?

00:31.398 --> 00:33.229
Devon, I
felt something in here.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.527
KITT's presence.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.226
Can you forget
about the records

00:36.336 --> 00:37.564
and take a look
at this face?

00:37.670 --> 00:39.695
I told him that
he couldn't see her anymore.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.501
Sounds like
brainwashing to me.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.007
That's exactly what it is.

00:43.076 --> 00:44.668
I want you to stop Knight
in person.

00:44.744 --> 00:45.768
What do you mean?

00:45.845 --> 00:46.777
Kill him.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.881
KITT, that's our car.
But nobody's driving it.

01:05.364 --> 01:08.163
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:08.301 --> 01:10.235
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.303 --> 01:12.271
who does not exist.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.671
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.747 --> 01:23.307
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.383 --> 01:25.613
the helpless, the powerless,

01:25.685 --> 01:28.518
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.412
Gotcha! Ha, ha.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.309
You see that, KITT?

02:29.382 --> 02:31.350
I've seen nothing
else for 300 miles.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.112
Don't you think
you've had enough?

02:33.186 --> 02:34.380
What's the problem?

02:34.454 --> 02:37.423
I thought you'd appreciate
my getting into computers.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.152
Playing a video game
where circles eat blobs

02:40.226 --> 02:42.490
is hardly
"getting into computers. "

02:42.562 --> 02:44.325
A computer
is a sophisticated,

02:44.397 --> 02:46.797
very complicated
piece of equipment, Michael.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.697
You wanna talk
complicated?

02:48.801 --> 02:51.167
Try getting 20,000 points
on this thing.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.496
Never. But, if you can
tear yourself away

02:53.606 --> 02:56.541
my sensors are picking up
a disabled automobile ahead.

02:56.609 --> 02:59.442
And that looks
like a damsel in distress.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.844
What do you say
we lend her a hand, huh?

03:10.657 --> 03:11.715
Help.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.181
Hi.

03:13.626 --> 03:14.615
Help.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.020
Help?

03:16.262 --> 03:17.422
What's the problem?

03:17.497 --> 03:18.464
It won't go.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.329
I'm afraid that's the extent
of my diagnostic capabilities.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.833
It won't go?
No.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.666
Well, that's a start.
Let's take a look.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.570
Aha!

03:31.644 --> 03:33.635
Aha, as in, I think
I see the problem?

03:33.713 --> 03:34.839
Yeah.

03:36.182 --> 03:38.343
Your distributor cap
was loose.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.181
Jump in, try it now.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.384
Okay.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.892
Looks like saying thanks
just isn't nearly enough.

03:50.964 --> 03:51.953
Thanks is plenty.

03:52.031 --> 03:53.498
I needed to
stretch my legs anyway.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.329
Look, my house
is just down the road.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.266
How about letting me
buy you a drink?

03:57.470 --> 03:59.768
Oh, come on.
What self-respecting knight

03:59.839 --> 04:01.807
denies his damsel
a chance to thank him?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.442
Besides,
what if this stupid car

04:03.543 --> 04:05.272
breaks down again
and you're gone?

04:12.619 --> 04:14.177
Quite a place you got here.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.619
Thank you.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.087
I'm an art dealer.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.555
I love having
beautiful things around me.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.061
Art and music.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.025
Two of the three essential
ingredients in life.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.396
I want you
to hear something.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.913
It's a new sound
from a group in Europe.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.345
Who are you?

05:48.648 --> 05:50.172
What are you doing to me?

06:01.994 --> 06:03.052
KITT.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.256
I beg your pardon.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.260
What do you
think you're doing?

06:44.771 --> 06:46.534
I'm highly classified material.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.574
Now get out of here,
before I...

06:54.447 --> 06:56.813
Michael, someone's trying
to gain access to me.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.078
Michael, can you hear me? Help.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.098
How did he do that?

07:29.916 --> 07:31.110
Oh, no, you don't!

07:38.090 --> 07:39.751
All right, if you insist.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.953
But that's all
you're going to get.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.570
Yeah!

08:03.282 --> 08:04.340
You've done it, Randy!

08:04.417 --> 08:07.011
Well, part of it.
I've got control of the car.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.145
Once I get into that
central processing unit,

08:09.222 --> 08:11.247
I'll have control
of the computer, too.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.019
How long will that take?

08:13.392 --> 08:16.054
It's hard to say.
Depends on how tough he is.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.356
How tough he is?

08:17.430 --> 08:18.988
You're talking
about a computer.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.090
Yeah. But he's got
a personality.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.899
I am the Knight
Industries Two Thousand.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.739
My serial number is
Alpha Delta 227529.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.779
I am unauthorized
to allow access

08:34.847 --> 08:36.780
to my central processing unit.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.615
I am the Knight Industries
Two Thousand.

08:43.688 --> 08:47.250
My serial number is
Alpha Delta 227529.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.055
I am unauthorized
to allow access

08:49.128 --> 08:50.993
to my central processing unit.

08:51.063 --> 08:53.031
Your computer
controls the car, Randy.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.964
We don't need
somebody else's.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.864
You control the car,
don't you?

08:58.738 --> 09:00.831
It's what you promised, huh?

09:27.867 --> 09:29.061
KITT.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.298
KITT, do you read me?

09:34.440 --> 09:35.532
KITT?

09:48.087 --> 09:49.577
You lost KITT?

09:49.755 --> 09:52.553
To a woman who picked you up
on the side of the road?

09:52.892 --> 09:54.223
Michael,
how could you?

09:54.293 --> 09:55.521
All right.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.453
I know how it sounds.
But I'm telling you

09:58.531 --> 10:00.965
it wasn't a casual mistake.
It was planned.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.927
I went over to her house,
and she puts on this music.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.997
It's... It's like a siren song.
Ultra-low frequency.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.169
Hypnotic or something.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.170
Her voice and that music

10:12.244 --> 10:14.610
literally drained
the strength out of me.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.205
All right,
can we debate this later?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.013
The fact is, KITT is gone
and we've got to get him back.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.020
How far can they get
with him?

10:22.088 --> 10:23.146
I thought you told me

10:23.222 --> 10:24.849
he's only programmed
to respond to me.

10:25.391 --> 10:28.292
That's right. But if someone
changed that program...

10:28.661 --> 10:29.923
What are those chances?

10:29.996 --> 10:32.464
Infinitesimal.
But they do exist.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.557
Do you think you
could find that house?

11:19.779 --> 11:21.974
I'm telling you,
she was here.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.045
And the place was
completely furnished.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.142
And it was not for sale.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.243
In that case,

11:28.320 --> 11:30.345
the young lady went to
a great deal of trouble

11:30.423 --> 11:32.254
to snare you and KITT.

11:32.324 --> 11:33.518
But why?

11:33.592 --> 11:35.059
That's a real good question.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.493
One way or another,
I'm gonna find the answer.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.302
Devon.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.176
What is it, Michael?

11:53.746 --> 11:55.213
I don't know.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.265
Devon,
I felt something in here.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.730
I don't know. A presence.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.569
KITT's presence.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.610
Devon.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.282
It's KITT.

12:37.156 --> 12:38.817
KITT, are you all right?

12:39.358 --> 12:41.656
KITT?
Come on, buddy. Talk to me.

12:42.695 --> 12:43.992
KITT!

13:00.513 --> 13:02.140
Will he be all right?

13:02.214 --> 13:04.239
He's been badly cannibalized.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.783
Cannibalized?

13:05.885 --> 13:08.217
Most of KITT's programs
were broken into.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.278
Everything concerning
the operation of the car

13:10.356 --> 13:11.516
is gone.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.150
In the wrong hands,
that car is a lethal weapon.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.990
They also tried to access
KITT's central processing unit

13:17.062 --> 13:18.427
and his bubble memory.

13:18.497 --> 13:21.591
Everything that makes KITT
what he is, who he is.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.231
Sounds like
brainwashing to me.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.065
That's exactly what it is.

13:26.338 --> 13:28.863
This is becoming a crisis
of major proportions.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.807
We still haven't got a clue
as to who we're dealing with.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.072
April, how are
those composites coming?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.671
I've already entered
Michael's descriptions.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.047
KITT's data should be
in the computer by now.

13:50.429 --> 13:51.487
That's her.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.032
Well, that's a good start.
Now let's see him.

13:54.266 --> 13:55.961
That's going to be
a little bit tougher.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.535
I only got a glimpse
of the kid.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.342
You know, I have
the strangest feeling

14:04.410 --> 14:06.037
I've seen him
somewhere before.

14:06.745 --> 14:09.305
Last month in Chicago,
there was a convention.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.645
All the brightest computer
kids in the country

14:11.717 --> 14:14.379
got together, read papers,
exchanged programs.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.546
Awards were given
for the best presentations.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.886
And a local boy won
almost every prize.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.591
There he is.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.789
That's amazingly close.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.589
His name
is Randy Merritt.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.190
Great work, April.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.463
We better find
him as soon as possible.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.201
I just hope that
he can give us some answers.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.368
Mmm-hmm?

14:38.744 --> 14:39.836
Thank you.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.778
Well, that was the clean room.

14:42.848 --> 14:45.646
KITT's ready,
in a manner of speaking.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.180
Now, he's going
to look different.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.786
The adjustment's been
quite difficult for him

14:51.857 --> 14:54.018
so please don't
make it any worse. Okay?

14:57.796 --> 15:00.321
Different? How?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.095
Well, Michael, um...

15:15.781 --> 15:18.682
Don't say a thing. Not one word.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.651
KITT, are you okay?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.381
I am not okay.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.388
I'm being held captive
inside a television set.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.824
KITT, it's the best we can do
to make you portable.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.452
And totally ridiculous.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.997
I feel like the booby prize
at a Halloween party.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.128
Just don't stand there.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.499
We've got to find
those beasts immediately.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.970
Uh, just as soon as
we get a lead on the boy.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.807
Uh, you sure you're up to
traveling, buddy?

15:43.876 --> 15:46.743
Like April said, Michael,
I'm portable.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.047
You seem to be enjoying this.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.352
It's kind of fun
driving with the top down.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.256
Well, if being
burned by the sun

16:01.360 --> 16:03.726
and buffeted by the wind
is your idea of fun.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.329
Don't get paranoid.

16:05.397 --> 16:07.991
I'm only driving this
until we get our car back.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.558
That's easy for you to say.
You're still you.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.264
I'm a... a shadow
of my former self.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.832
I used to be sleek, and black,
and dashing, and now...

16:17.042 --> 16:20.034
Oh, Michael, do I look
just dreadful? Be honest.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.603
KITT, what matters to me
is who you are,

16:22.681 --> 16:24.342
not what you look like.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.843
Sure we don't have the car.
So we can't turbo boost.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.051
So we can't go
over 200 miles an hour.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.720
It was all icing
on the cake anyway.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.019
It wasn't you.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.152
It wasn't?

16:36.228 --> 16:39.026
No, the car was fantastic,
but if you break it down

16:39.098 --> 16:40.929
it was steel,
rubber, and glass.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.558
We can always
make another one.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.635
But you...

16:43.736 --> 16:46.136
You are a lot more
than silicon chips

16:46.205 --> 16:47.570
and fancy circuitry.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.899
You're my buddy,
you're my partner.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.638
KITT, you're one of a kind.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.112
Thank you, Michael.
The feeling's mutual.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.675
I'd give
anything to know where he is.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.778
I've been worried sick
since he disappeared.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.414
It's been
nearly a month now.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.083
No calls. No letters.

17:07.159 --> 17:08.717
The police haven't
turned up a thing.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.921
The private investigator
I hired has been useless.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.362
Mrs. Merritt,
I think I saw your son.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.455
He was with a woman.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.693
You saw him? With Adrianne?

17:15.768 --> 17:16.826
I don't know her name.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.061
She was tall, dark hair,
late 20s or early 30s.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.435
That's her. Where did you
see them? Please...

17:21.507 --> 17:22.598
Where can I find him?

17:22.708 --> 17:23.696
I don't know.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.471
They disappeared. But I want
to find him as much as you do.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.139
Anything you can tell me
about this woman will help me.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.647
I really don't know that much.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.811
Her name's Adrianne Margeaux.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.715
They met at one of those
computer conventions.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.221
She started filling his head

17:39.291 --> 17:41.054
with plans
for building a computer

17:41.126 --> 17:43.424
making millions of dollars.
It's... It's crazy.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.531
Randy's a good kid.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.033
But he's young
and very impressionable.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.562
She's so much older
and... and beautiful

17:54.673 --> 17:56.436
and so sophisticated.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.906
I saw him changing
right in front of my eyes.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.469
He started lying.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.206
He'd never done that before.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.046
Finally, I told him
he couldn't see her anymore.

18:09.788 --> 18:12.086
And two days later,
he was gone.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.151
Sorry.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.023
Couldn't have
taken much with him.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.528
What do you say
we check his room?

18:17.596 --> 18:19.154
Maybe there's
a clue in there.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.233
I don't think so.
Not in his room.

18:22.534 --> 18:23.660
Why?

18:30.642 --> 18:33.770
Looks like Randy wasn't
into much, except for his computer.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.041
There wasn't anything else.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.639
Randy was so quiet, so shy.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.843
I thought that computer
would be good for him.

18:39.918 --> 18:41.818
Give him something
to share with me.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.981
But once he discovered
the world inside that machine,

18:46.492 --> 18:48.392
he disappeared into it.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.189
I used to hate it
when he'd spend hours

18:52.264 --> 18:53.663
with that computer.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.731
Now I would give anything
to have him here.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.111
Whoo!

20:47.779 --> 20:48.973
What's the matter?

20:49.047 --> 20:50.947
You're driving
like a drunken sailor.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.042
I told you it might
take some time.

20:54.119 --> 20:56.212
I thought you could deliver
what you promised.

20:56.288 --> 20:57.346
I can!

20:57.456 --> 21:00.220
It was a mistake to send
a boy to do a man's job.

21:00.325 --> 21:01.815
We should never
have gotten rid

21:01.893 --> 21:03.758
of the Knight
Industries CPU.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.126
You told me to.

21:05.864 --> 21:07.923
Besides, it's not
the computer you want.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.594
It's him, the guy you stole
the car from. Isn't it?

21:11.136 --> 21:13.104
I'll make this work. I will.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.013
I know it must seem
strange talking to a television set

21:32.090 --> 21:33.921
but you could say something.

21:35.260 --> 21:36.852
I'm sorry, KITT.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.489
I was just thinking
about Randy Merritt.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.265
I always thought
where a person lived

21:42.367 --> 21:43.994
reflected who they are.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.592
That can be deceptive.

21:45.704 --> 21:46.762
My present surroundings

21:46.872 --> 21:48.840
certainly don't reflect
who I am.

21:49.174 --> 21:51.506
Yeah, but his room
was so empty.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.975
KITT, there was nothing
of him in there.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.275
No personality. No character.

21:57.716 --> 21:59.411
That doesn't surprise me.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.317
It sounds like Randy lived
in his own private world.

22:04.022 --> 22:05.489
KITT, that's it.

22:06.224 --> 22:07.623
His own private world.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.253
His mother said
he lived inside his computer.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.669
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

22:24.743 --> 22:25.903
Thanks.

22:26.778 --> 22:29.076
Okay, buddy, let's see
what we can find out.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.609
Michael, are you
sure we should be doing this?

22:31.683 --> 22:33.480
Computers are very personal.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.485
Well, look at it
this way, pal.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.351
The sooner we
find Randy Merritt

22:37.422 --> 22:39.185
the sooner you can trade
that portable in

22:39.257 --> 22:40.315
for a bigger model.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.292
I'll get right to work.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.094
I'm accessing everything
that's not coded.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.562
It's all rather predictable.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.599
Video games,
telephone numbers

22:48.667 --> 22:50.157
homework assignments.

22:50.268 --> 22:51.997
Several weeks overdue,
I might add.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.536
Just a moment, what's this?

22:58.477 --> 23:00.536
"Orpheus"?
What does that mean?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.907
I'm not sure but it must
have been important

23:02.981 --> 23:04.141
because it's protected

23:04.216 --> 23:06.150
by a rather sophisticated
entry code.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.583
Can you break it?

23:07.652 --> 23:09.381
Probably.
It could take time.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.979
Go for it. We don't have
much else to go on.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.453
Michael, someone's calling
into this computer.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.862
Calling in
from the outside?

23:18.930 --> 23:20.761
Yes, via the telephone.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.424
It's another computer.

23:22.534 --> 23:23.796
KITT, that's gotta be Randy.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.494
Can you trace the call?

23:26.705 --> 23:28.696
It's coming from
a mobile phone.

23:42.954 --> 23:44.581
Looks pretty desolate
out here.

23:44.656 --> 23:46.487
Sure you know
what you're talking about?

23:46.558 --> 23:48.583
Michael, I might look
like a television

23:48.660 --> 23:50.093
but I'm still a computer.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.659
Of course, I'm sure.

23:51.730 --> 23:52.958
I don't know.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.133
Nothing in sight.

24:04.543 --> 24:07.273
KITT, that's our car.

24:07.412 --> 24:09.437
But nobody's driving it.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.811
I'm picking up
electronic impulses, Michael.

24:11.883 --> 24:13.282
It's under remote control.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.723
And he's heading
right for us.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.159
Then I suggest
we move quickly.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.441
You know something?

24:39.211 --> 24:41.941
I don't much care for being
on this end of things.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.674
That makes two of us.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.908
What was it like, Michael?

24:46.318 --> 24:47.376
What, KITT?

24:47.452 --> 24:50.615
Seeing my body functioning
without me or you.

24:51.356 --> 24:53.449
It was a little spooky.
Let me tell you.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.152
Did it seem like me?

24:55.293 --> 24:56.988
Yeah, it did and it didn't.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.529
It looked like you,

24:58.797 --> 25:00.765
but somehow
it just wasn't the same.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.331
I don't understand.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.368
It didn't have
your soul, KITT.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.502
Without that,
it could never be the same.

25:07.572 --> 25:09.096
Thank you, Michael.

25:10.942 --> 25:13.376
I think we just
found the source.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.524
My, my. What a delightfully
small world.

25:36.902 --> 25:38.494
I've been
thinking about you.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.901
To my brave knight

25:42.474 --> 25:45.204
even if he seems to have lost
his trusty steed.

25:45.577 --> 25:47.204
I want my car back.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.110
Yes, I'm sure you do.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.906
Coincidentally,
I very much want

25:51.983 --> 25:54.110
the one remaining piece
of him.

25:54.352 --> 25:56.081
The central processing unit.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.122
You're having
a little trouble without it?

25:58.189 --> 25:59.656
No. Not trouble.

26:00.325 --> 26:02.122
But it would
simplify things.

26:03.094 --> 26:05.722
Let me have the CPU
for 24 hours

26:06.298 --> 26:09.324
and I'll let you have it
and the car back intact.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.993
And if I don't?

26:11.770 --> 26:13.829
You'll never see
the car again.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.531
Look, I don't know
what you're up to

26:15.640 --> 26:17.335
but I don't like
being threatened.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.001
And I don't do deals.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.204
So, why don't you tell
your little friend here

26:21.279 --> 26:22.507
that you're gonna
come with me?

26:22.581 --> 26:25.015
You underestimate me.

26:26.351 --> 26:29.479
You see, I always have an ace
somewhere up my sleeve.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.926
Fredericks.

26:38.029 --> 26:39.587
What are you
going to do with Randy

26:39.664 --> 26:41.825
if I don't call
you every half hour?

26:44.369 --> 26:45.859
Kill him.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.574
It's not just
recovering KITT's body now.

26:57.649 --> 26:59.674
It's Randy's life, too.

26:59.751 --> 27:01.013
He's a young kid,

27:01.119 --> 27:02.882
and he's in
way over his head.

27:02.921 --> 27:05.219
Adrianne is
a regular black widow

27:05.290 --> 27:06.450
and I'm telling you

27:06.524 --> 27:09.015
when she's through with him,
she's gonna kill him.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.756
We still don't know anything
more about her.

27:12.497 --> 27:14.590
We don't even know
if it's her real name.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.226
I've circulated
her photographs

27:17.335 --> 27:19.064
amongst my
law-enforcement contacts.

27:19.170 --> 27:22.264
Even Interpol.
No one recognizes her.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.801
Adrianne implied that
this Orpheus project,

27:25.877 --> 27:27.003
whatever it is,

27:27.078 --> 27:29.046
is gonna come down
by tomorrow afternoon.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.513
Maybe that's our best shot.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.607
No, I've researched it
from its genesis

27:32.684 --> 27:34.413
in Greek mythology

27:34.486 --> 27:36.579
to every conceivable
modern application.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.880
I can't find any connection.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.481
We can't just give up.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.219
No, of course not, Michael.

27:42.293 --> 27:45.228
But we've exhausted
every single idea we've had.

27:51.703 --> 27:53.000
Michael, what is it?

27:53.071 --> 27:54.436
It's a long shot.

27:58.443 --> 27:59.410
Hello?

27:59.477 --> 28:01.672
Mrs. Merritt.
Yeah, this is Michael Knight.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.008
Have you found him?

28:03.048 --> 28:04.140
No, not yet.

28:04.215 --> 28:06.479
Listen, you said that after
Randy met Adrianne,

28:06.551 --> 28:08.781
he started to lie.
What did he lie about?

28:08.853 --> 28:10.548
Anything in particular?

28:12.490 --> 28:13.650
Adrianne.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.260
What kind of lies,
can you give me an example?

28:16.327 --> 28:17.316
Yeah.

28:18.296 --> 28:21.891
One Saturday, he had me drive
him to The Blackwell Hotel.

28:21.966 --> 28:24.628
He said there was
a computer convention.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.230
There wasn't?

28:26.404 --> 28:27.371
No.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.839
I found out later
he'd gone to visit her.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.467
She was staying there.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.875
Apparently.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.571
He spent all day
with her in her suite.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.288
I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't help you.

28:52.197 --> 28:55.530
We guarantee our clientele
the strictest privacy.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.000
Registration
is confidential.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.161
Can you forget
about the records

29:01.272 --> 29:02.933
and take a look
at this face?

29:11.549 --> 29:13.449
Of course. Miss Margeaux.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.816
She's often here
but she never registers.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.816
How could she not register?

29:17.889 --> 29:20.619
She stays in Mr. Atherton's
permanent suite.

29:20.692 --> 29:24.253
Mr. Atherton.
Mr. George Atherton?

30:03.001 --> 30:04.662
You've been awful quiet.

30:04.903 --> 30:06.530
How's the work coming?

30:07.739 --> 30:11.197
It's okay.
It'll be okay. You'll see.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.777
I'll have complete control
of the car by tomorrow.

30:15.013 --> 30:17.208
That makes me very happy

30:17.916 --> 30:19.247
and proud.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.017
Why do you look so sad?

30:28.593 --> 30:30.185
Look, Adrianne,

30:31.729 --> 30:34.823
the computer stuff is fine,
but the rest of it...

30:36.467 --> 30:37.593
Maybe...

30:38.870 --> 30:40.963
Maybe I shouldn't
be involved.

30:41.739 --> 30:44.469
I mean, I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.208
Any of it.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.046
After this,
we'll take a long trip.

30:50.114 --> 30:51.581
Just you and me.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.448
The world will be
our playground.

30:54.819 --> 30:58.186
And you, Randy,
will be my little prince.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.391
I'm not little.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.790
Randy, that was just a phrase,
a figure of speech.

31:05.463 --> 31:06.760
Are you jealous?

31:06.831 --> 31:07.855
No.

31:08.499 --> 31:09.864
Yes, you are.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.497
You were with him today.

31:14.405 --> 31:15.804
Michael Knight?

31:16.541 --> 31:18.873
You darling, I'm flattered.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.638
But you have nothing
to be jealous of.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.544
Handsome men are nice,

31:23.615 --> 31:26.516
but looks aren't what
really attract a woman.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.279
At least, not for long.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.586
No, a woman is
attracted by power,

31:31.856 --> 31:34.256
and a man's power
is in his mind

31:34.893 --> 31:38.385
what a man can do, what
he can create and control.

31:39.297 --> 31:41.561
Your genius is your power,
Randy.

31:43.034 --> 31:44.695
Never forget that.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.804
I told you, I've never heard
of Adrianne Margeaux.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.637
Now, if you don't mind.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.006
Look, Mr. Atherton,

31:53.077 --> 31:55.511
your private life
is your own business.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.810
But this whole thing
is out of control.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.873
A Knight Industries
Two Thousand computer

31:59.951 --> 32:01.111
was nearly destroyed.

32:01.219 --> 32:02.811
The car is still missing.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.947
And a young boy's life
is in danger.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.685
And it all comes back
to one Adrianne Margeaux.

32:07.825 --> 32:10.692
Which leaves the whole mess
on your front porch.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.867
I've known Adrianne
for about five years.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.631
We've been
more than friends.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.040
But I've never
discussed KITT.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.301
But you were on
our board of directors

32:27.412 --> 32:29.175
and you know about KITT.

32:30.381 --> 32:32.315
She... she could have
gone through my files.

32:32.383 --> 32:35.011
It... It could have
been pillow talk.

32:36.688 --> 32:37.882
Mr. Atherton,

32:38.022 --> 32:41.514
does the word "Orpheus"
mean anything to you?

32:43.895 --> 32:45.954
When we became involved,

32:46.664 --> 32:48.962
I set up a Swiss
numbered account for her.

32:49.033 --> 32:52.059
Only she has access.
We code-named it Orpheus.

32:52.236 --> 32:55.103
Each letter in the word
is a number in the account.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.635
We think she's
planning a crime.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.176
A very big crime.

32:59.477 --> 33:02.139
My guess is that it involves
something of yours.

33:02.246 --> 33:03.304
That's absurd.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.042
How could she
possibly hurt me?

33:05.116 --> 33:06.242
You tell me.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.308
What do you have
that's worth a lot of money

33:08.386 --> 33:09.717
and is somehow vulnerable?

33:11.255 --> 33:12.347
My collection.

33:12.423 --> 33:13.788
What collection?

33:14.058 --> 33:17.425
My art. It's been on display
in San Francisco.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.055
It's being transported

33:19.130 --> 33:21.064
by a special
armored car to Denver.

33:21.299 --> 33:22.960
Any idea what it's worth?

33:23.067 --> 33:26.264
At the last appraisal,
over $14 million.

34:11.014 --> 34:13.380
Devon, I'll need every
possible piece of information

34:13.451 --> 34:15.112
on this special car.

34:15.186 --> 34:18.746
The terrain, the intersecting
highways, the route, the works.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.083
April's arranging

34:20.190 --> 34:22.591
to interface KITT
with Centra-Comp right now.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.427
From what I understand,

34:24.562 --> 34:27.588
the vehicle is
a state-of-the-art armored bus

34:27.831 --> 34:30.460
capable of withstanding
virtually any impact.

34:30.601 --> 34:31.931
How about a laser?

34:32.036 --> 34:33.594
KITT's laser isn't operable.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.036
The laser
power pack is still there.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.003
Now, if Randy's
the computer genius

34:38.076 --> 34:40.873
he appears to be,
anything is possible.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.946
Well, KITT's connected
with Centra-Comp.

34:43.014 --> 34:45.277
Within minutes, he'll know
everything we've got.

34:45.349 --> 34:48.147
Everything except
where they plan to strike.

34:48.319 --> 34:50.378
Thanks a lot, guys.
We'll be in touch.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.385
My laser power pack.

34:54.458 --> 34:55.652
Michael, in the wrong hands,

34:55.726 --> 34:57.956
it's a weapon
of incredible destruction.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.395
I'm aware, pal.
I'm well aware.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.563
How are you doing
down there? Okay?

35:03.668 --> 35:05.397
"How are you
doing down there?"

35:05.503 --> 35:07.596
You're making me
feel like a child.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.929
Sorry, big guy.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.303
That's better.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.833
But, darling,
those things don't matter.

35:39.937 --> 35:41.529
Those are things
of the past.

35:42.206 --> 35:43.969
Yeah, but it's not
just that.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.531
It's lots of things.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.575
Like my club,
The Computer Clones.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.476
I'm secretary-treasurer.

35:49.547 --> 35:51.708
I owe petty cash $8.95.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.113
We'll make it good.
I promise you.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.550
Randy, listen to me.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.815
You're just a little
homesick. That's all.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.516
It's not unusual.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.457
The trick is not to think
of what you've left behind,

36:02.560 --> 36:03.857
but what awaits you.

36:13.771 --> 36:15.830
I've got something, Michael.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.237
Go for it.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.572
The two most likely places
for intercept

36:19.644 --> 36:22.204
are 10.2 miles north
of Cutter's Crossing

36:22.280 --> 36:26.148
and 6.7 miles north-northeast
of a town called Bridgeport.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.649
Which one is more likely?

36:28.753 --> 36:31.347
They're virtually the same
in terms of desirability.

36:31.556 --> 36:33.615
But I think Randy
worships computers.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.558
I think he'd abandon
his own sense of judgment

36:36.627 --> 36:38.618
for even
a fractional advantage.

36:38.796 --> 36:41.663
In that case, I'd say the
Cutter's Crossing location.

36:41.899 --> 36:43.093
All right.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.496
KITT, what's wrong?

36:49.607 --> 36:52.405
A chronic problem with
petrol-dependent vehicles.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.807
We're out of gas.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.402
Out of gas?

36:55.479 --> 36:57.879
Why didn't you tell me
we were running out of gas?

36:57.949 --> 36:59.576
Why didn't you
watch the gauge?

36:59.650 --> 37:02.278
You're the driver.
I'm only along for the ride.

37:04.922 --> 37:06.651
How far to Cutter's Crossing?

37:06.724 --> 37:08.419
Nearly 90 miles.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.550
Oh!

37:32.783 --> 37:34.045
Hello! Please!

37:34.819 --> 37:35.945
Hey!

37:39.757 --> 37:40.781
Stop.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.091
Hey!

37:47.732 --> 37:48.892
Thanks for stopping.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.900
Listen, how would you
like to own

37:51.002 --> 37:52.469
this expensive convertible?

37:53.738 --> 37:54.705
What's that?

37:54.805 --> 37:55.772
Look.

37:55.873 --> 37:58.637
I'm in a big hurry.
I've just run out of gas.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.904
I'd like to trade cars.

38:01.012 --> 38:04.140
This convertible is worth
10 times what this is.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.806
More! It's a great deal.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.618
If it's... If it's
such a great deal,

38:18.696 --> 38:21.096
how come I'm driving
and you ain't?

38:22.233 --> 38:23.427
Look.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.501
I'll trade you straight across
and I'll throw in...

38:29.473 --> 38:31.668
$68. What do you say?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.009
Uh, tell you what.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.507
Yeah?

38:36.580 --> 38:39.344
Throw in $68
and that little TV set there

38:39.417 --> 38:40.782
and you got a deal.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.918
I can't throw in the TV.

38:44.288 --> 38:47.121
I've been wanting a little TV
like that for years.

38:47.425 --> 38:50.121
But you don't understand.
it's not really a TV.

38:50.561 --> 38:52.358
It looks like a little TV.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.032
Look at me.
I'm an honest man.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.363
I will trade you
the convertible. $68.

38:57.468 --> 38:58.730
You give me your address,

38:58.969 --> 39:00.834
I'll send you a little TV
just like that one

39:00.938 --> 39:03.463
right to your very own home.
What do you say?

39:03.741 --> 39:06.039
Thought you said
it wasn't a little TV.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.203
How far away
is the armored bus?

39:46.517 --> 39:48.451
Two minutes and 13 seconds.

39:50.254 --> 39:52.984
Don't you think you should
start the computer override?

39:57.695 --> 39:59.390
I said, don't you think
you should start

39:59.463 --> 40:01.021
the computer override?

40:09.206 --> 40:10.673
That's my good boy.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.138
I'm not your boy.

40:30.528 --> 40:32.359
That Elmer was quite a character.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.658
Yeah.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.391
Drove a hard bargain.

40:35.466 --> 40:36.797
Yeah.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.559
We're behind schedule.

40:39.904 --> 40:42.099
KITT, keep one thing in mind.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.537
I can always switch
you to a game show.

40:54.218 --> 40:58.951
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

41:04.195 --> 41:05.628
What's going on?

41:05.696 --> 41:07.527
I don't know.
A red light came on.

41:32.923 --> 41:34.185
Hey, what are they doing?

41:34.258 --> 41:35.486
I don't know.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.473
Let's go.

42:12.062 --> 42:13.757
Drop it! Now!

43:13.023 --> 43:15.218
There's a car coming this way.
Who's inside?

43:23.601 --> 43:26.229
It's Michael Knight. Come on.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.206
Fredericks,
get over here. Get in!

43:38.749 --> 43:41.343
I want you to stop Knight
in person, not remote control.

43:41.418 --> 43:42.510
What do you mean?

43:42.586 --> 43:43.678
Kill him.

43:43.754 --> 43:45.722
Fredericks, take
a ride with the whiz kid.

43:45.789 --> 43:47.984
Make sure he finishes off
Mr. Knight.

43:48.559 --> 43:50.618
No. I'm not gonna do it.
Come on.

44:22.259 --> 44:23.658
Uh-oh.

44:24.395 --> 44:27.853
There's your body again,
with Randy behind the wheel.

44:27.965 --> 44:29.057
Randy?

44:29.133 --> 44:30.964
I can't believe
he'd try and harm us.

44:31.068 --> 44:32.330
He may not have a choice.

44:36.573 --> 44:38.871
Just keep your foot
on the floorboard, kid.

44:38.942 --> 44:40.671
It's only
a matter of seconds now.

44:43.814 --> 44:45.975
Michael, we're
on a collision course!

44:46.050 --> 44:48.280
KITT, can you override
Randy's CPU?

44:48.352 --> 44:49.614
With my limited power,

44:49.687 --> 44:51.120
I wouldn't have
a chance, Michael.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.213
In that case, give me
just enough juice

44:53.290 --> 44:55.019
to try one little trick.

44:55.092 --> 44:56.116
All right, hit it!

44:56.193 --> 44:57.660
I'm trying, Michael!

45:00.064 --> 45:01.224
Yeah!

45:15.846 --> 45:17.074
Hop in.

45:19.750 --> 45:22.048
Michael, don't forget me!

45:34.932 --> 45:36.763
You handle this thing
pretty well.

45:36.834 --> 45:37.926
Thanks.

45:38.035 --> 45:40.663
Listen. I'm...
I'm sorry about all this.

45:41.105 --> 45:44.040
I guess we've got just
one loose end to wrap up, huh?

46:00.858 --> 46:02.120
Turner!

46:06.563 --> 46:09.430
Randy, I can't
believe you double-crossed me.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.558
I can.

46:10.667 --> 46:11.793
Me, too.

46:12.136 --> 46:14.297
In fact, I didn't
doubt him for a minute.

46:26.183 --> 46:28.208
I don't know how
we'll ever thank you.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.116
Well, it's enough that
Randy's back home

46:30.187 --> 46:31.814
and Adrianne
is under arrest.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.147
When do you go
back to classes?

46:34.224 --> 46:36.124
Monday. I, uh, fell behind,

46:36.193 --> 46:38.286
but I'm kind of looking
forward to catching up.

46:38.362 --> 46:40.091
Okay, I'll see you later.

46:40.164 --> 46:41.631
Take it easy.
You, too.

46:41.698 --> 46:42.722
Bye.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.992
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah,
I almost forgot.

46:46.703 --> 46:50.002
In case you ever want
a break from your computer.

46:51.942 --> 46:52.909
Wow.

46:53.343 --> 46:54.503
Thanks.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.112
You're welcome.

47:13.797 --> 47:15.162
What a relief.

47:15.232 --> 47:16.392
What do you mean?

47:16.466 --> 47:17.694
To see Randy home again?

47:17.801 --> 47:18.961
To be home again.

47:19.069 --> 47:20.866
Michael, you have no idea
what it was like

47:20.971 --> 47:22.598
to be locked inside
that little TV.

47:22.706 --> 47:26.107
Driving Elmer's old Studebaker
was no picnic, either, pal.

47:26.376 --> 47:28.071
I'm glad to have you back.

47:28.145 --> 47:29.612
Devon's calling.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.614
I guess it's business
as usual.

47:33.116 --> 47:34.879
I don't know about that.

47:35.319 --> 47:36.911
Let's play a little hooky.

47:36.987 --> 47:39.455
"Hooky"? I'm not familiar
with the term, Michael.

47:39.523 --> 47:41.218
Then let me educate you

47:41.291 --> 47:43.759
in one of
life's finer pleasures.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.931
Oh, this does feel good.

47:56.974 --> 47:58.942
How about
a little turbo boost?

47:59.009 --> 48:01.000
Dare we?
Without sufficient reason?

48:01.111 --> 48:04.842
"Without sufficient reason"
is the definition of "hooky. "

48:05.115 --> 48:07.743
Shall we, as they say,
go for it?

48:07.818 --> 48:08.807
Let's.
