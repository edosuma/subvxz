WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:07.808
OH. OH, NO. OH.
[growling, yelling on TV]

00:07.841 --> 00:10.211
HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THE MOVIE

00:10.244 --> 00:11.279
WITH YOUR EYES COVERED?

00:11.312 --> 00:12.280
IT'S TOO SCARY, DANNY.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.314
JUST DESCRIBE IT TO ME.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.216
OKAY, THE LIGHTS
ARE FLICKERING,

00:15.249 --> 00:17.218
FACELESS KIDS ARE COMING
THROUGH THE MIRROR RIGHT NOW.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.619
WHAT?
IT'S ALL GOING TO HELL.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.354
DANNY, STOP DESCRIBING
IT SO WELL,

00:20.388 --> 00:21.422
IT'S WORSE
THAN JUST WATCHING IT.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.057
WAIT A MINUTE...

00:23.091 --> 00:24.358
ISN'T THIS MOVIE STILL
IN THE THEATERS?

00:24.392 --> 00:26.427
MM-HMM. I STOLE IT
FROM THE INTERNET.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.695
YOU STOLE IT?

00:27.728 --> 00:28.796
YEAH, THAT'S HOW I GET
ALL MY MUSIC AND MOVIES.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.431
I GO TO THIS REALLY
COOL SITE.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.633
IT'S CALLED
VIDEODUMP.ALQAEDA.BIZ.

00:32.666 --> 00:33.734
YOU STEAL MUSIC TOO?

00:33.767 --> 00:34.735
OF COURSE, DANNY.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.703
DON'T YOU SUPPORT
THE ARTIST?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.771
WHAT ABOUT THE A&R GUY
WHO TOOK A CHANCE ON 'EM

00:37.805 --> 00:40.174
WITH THE LABEL BRASS?

00:40.208 --> 00:41.542
DON'T YOU THINK OF HIM?
NO.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.277
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.645
IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW
IF EVERYBODY DOES IT.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.314
IT'S LIKE HOW I PRETEND
TO BE IN THE ARMED FORCES

00:46.347 --> 00:47.215
SO I CAN BOARD
A PLANE EARLY.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.649
I NEVER BREAK THE LAW,
OKAY?

00:48.682 --> 00:50.118
WE GO DANCING,
I MAKE SURE

00:50.151 --> 00:52.220
THE CLUB HAS A VALID
CABARET LICENSE.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.221
[ding]

00:53.254 --> 00:54.488
OH, LOOK!

00:54.522 --> 00:56.457
THE FINAL HUNGER GAMES
DOWNLOADED.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.858
I'M GONNA BE SO SAD
WHEN THOSE ARE OVER

00:57.891 --> 00:59.493
AND I CAN'T STEAL THEM
ANYMORE.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.728
[alarm blaring]
(Danny)
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.196
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
[tapping keys]

01:02.230 --> 01:04.865
YOU--YOU CLICKED
A VIRUS.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.700
THIS IS A RUN-OF-THE-MILL
COMPUTER-DESTROYING VIRUS.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.769
ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS GET A WHOLE NEW COMPUTER

01:08.802 --> 01:11.272
AND THEN TELL THE FBI
THAT YOURS WAS STOLEN.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.174
[ding ding]
OH, MY GOD,
THE CAMERA TURNED ON!

01:13.207 --> 01:14.442
- AAH!
- AAH!

01:14.475 --> 01:16.410
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

01:16.444 --> 01:17.511
[clatters]

01:17.545 --> 01:20.514
[upbeat music]

01:20.548 --> 01:28.556
*

01:32.393 --> 01:35.363
MA, TELL MINDY
ABOUT THAT WATER AEROBICS CLASS

01:35.396 --> 01:36.297
YOU SIGNED UP FOR.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.267
DANNY, YOU KEEP CALLING
IT "WATER AEROBICS."

01:39.300 --> 01:41.502
THAT'S JUST SO UNCOOL.

01:41.535 --> 01:45.473
IT'S CALLED "SYNCHRONIZED
SENIORS AQUA DISCO."

01:45.506 --> 01:47.208
I'M NOT SIGNING UP
FOR THAT.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.310
I DON'T WANNA GET
TOO MUSCULAR.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.811
I HAVE A DANCER'S BODY.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.181
ANNETTE, DO YOU HAVE
A BATHING SUIT?

01:53.214 --> 01:55.316
I COULD LEND YOU A BIKINI,
BUT I ONLY HAVE BOTTOMS

01:55.349 --> 01:56.617
'CAUSE I LIKE TO GO
AU NATUREL--

01:56.650 --> 01:58.419
OKAY, WE GOT IT.
WE GOT IT.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.221
NO, I'M GONNA WEAR
RICHIE'S SOCCER SHORTS

02:00.254 --> 02:02.156
AND MY GARFIELD T-SHIRT.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.258
DANNY'S WORRIED
I'LL GET OGLED AT.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.194
THE INSTRUCTOR'S CUBAN.
IT'S CULTURAL.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.728
A BAGGY T-SHIRT
AND SHORTS?

02:07.761 --> 02:08.862
IF YOU WEAR
THAT TO THE POOL,

02:08.896 --> 02:10.331
YOU'RE GONNA GET
STRAIGHT UP BULLIED.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.499
OH, COME ON.
WHO'S GONNA BULLY HER?

02:11.532 --> 02:12.866
LOOK AT THIS SWEET FACE.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.734
I WOULD.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.303
OKAY, I'M TAKING
YOU SHOPPING ON MONDAY.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.804
WE'RE GETTING YOU
A NEW SWIMSUIT.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.840
WOW, MY TWO FAVORITE GIRLS
GOING SHOPPING TOGETHER?

02:19.873 --> 02:21.409
I LOVE IT.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.877
WE'RE FINALLY GONNA GET SOME
ONE-ON-ONE TIME, MINDY.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.179
JUST YOU AND ME.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.914
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
ALL THE THINGS

02:26.947 --> 02:30.651
I WALKED IN ON DANNY DOING
OVER THE YEARS.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.819
MASTURBATING?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.254
OKAY.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.555
OH, GOD, DOT.
WHAT?

02:34.588 --> 02:37.225
COME ON, DOT.
THAT'S GROSS, ALL RIGHT?

02:37.258 --> 02:38.892
(Peter)
WELL, WE HAD A NIGHT
OF CRAZY SEX,

02:38.926 --> 02:40.328
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE PUNISHMENT.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.263
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING
TO BRUNCH?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.198
ACTUALLY, I HATE BRUNCH.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.300
BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE,
THE FIRST BRUNCH GUY

02:46.334 --> 02:47.335
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WORLD,

02:47.368 --> 02:48.436
WE CAN GO GET SOME.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.470
SHUT UP.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.304
I JUST THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW,

02:50.338 --> 02:51.071
WE SHOULD DO
WHAT YOU WANNA DO TODAY

02:51.104 --> 02:53.541
SO YOU WANNA GO
TO SPIN CLASS,

02:53.574 --> 02:55.809
OR YOU WANT ME TO MEET
YOUR FRIEND'S NEW BABY?

02:55.843 --> 02:58.779
[laughs]
WHO IS THIS MONSTER
YOU'RE DESCRIBING?

02:58.812 --> 03:00.314
I'M NOT ONE
OF THOSE SAMPLE SALE,

03:00.348 --> 03:02.316
MANI-PEDI PRINCESSES.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.651
I JUST WANNA CHILL OUT
AND HAVE FUN.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.719
YOU LIKE,
MASTERED LIFE.

03:05.753 --> 03:06.787
I KNOW.

03:06.820 --> 03:07.788
I'M LIKE
THE MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY

03:07.821 --> 03:09.390
OF THE ROMANCE NOVEL WORLD.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.425
SO ON YOUR IDEAL SUNDAY,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

03:11.459 --> 03:13.494
I WOULD DRINK A BUNCH
OF HARD LEMMYS

03:13.527 --> 03:16.264
AND MAKE OUTLANDISH
FOOTBALL BETS.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.500
WAIT.
WAIT, I'M SORRY.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.370
DID I SAY THE WRONG THING?
WE CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.404
YOU WANT ME TO PUT TOGETHER
SOME SHELVES?

03:23.437 --> 03:24.572
DO YOU WANNA GO VISIT
YOUR SISTER?

03:24.605 --> 03:25.539
NO, CALM DOWN.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.808
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A RUN
TO THE LIQUOR STORE.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.277
YOUR MISSION,
WHILE I'M GONE,

03:29.310 --> 03:31.279
IS TO MELT CHEESE
ON SOMETHING.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.913
I BELIEVE IN YOU,
PETER.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.482
OKAY.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.585
GUYS, I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.553
WHAT? THAT YOU'RE RICH?
WE KNOW.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.389
TAMRA, CAN WE PLEASE
GO BACK TO THE DAYS

03:41.422 --> 03:43.724
BEFORE YOU FOUND
MY PAYSTUB IN THE TRASH?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.793
I'M TRYING TO TELL EVERYBODY
HERE THAT YOUR FRIEND ABBY

03:45.826 --> 03:46.794
IS MY PERFECT WOMAN.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.729
OH, SORRY.
GO ON, DR. P.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.365
DATING ABBY IS LIKE DATING
A RIDE THAT WON'T STOP.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.933
SHE'S AMAZING.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.034
ALL SHE DOES IS WRITE
TWO HOURS' WORTH

03:54.067 --> 03:55.703
OF SEXY STORIES
DURING THE DAY,

03:55.736 --> 03:57.037
AND THEN SHE'S
JUST HANGING.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.806
DAY DRINKING,
NIGHT SMOKING,

03:58.839 --> 04:00.874
AND SHE'S NOT ONE OF THESE
UPTIGHT MANHATTAN CHICKS

04:00.908 --> 04:02.376
THAT'S TRYING
TO GET ME TO CHANGE,

04:02.410 --> 04:04.278
OR MAKE ME WEAR PANTS
WHEN I LEAVE THE HOUSE,

04:04.312 --> 04:06.280
OR OBSESSED WITH THE NEW
BLOW DRY BAR DOWN THE BLOCK.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.382
BLOW DRY BAR?
HOW BASIC DO YOU THINK I AM?

04:08.416 --> 04:09.650
THIS IS FROM THE TOUSLE BAR.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.819
IT COST $100.
WHAT?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.321
YEAH, MORE THAN
THIS GUY'S RENT.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.322
YEAH!

04:14.355 --> 04:15.222
PETE, DON'T SCREW THIS UP.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.757
A LOW-MAINTENANCE GIRL
THAT LIKES TO HANG,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.492
NO DRAMA, NOT A LOT
OF PAMPERING.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.993
OH, LIKE YOU'RE NOT PAMPERED?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.695
WHY DON'T I GIVE MORGAN ONE
OF YOUR 9,000 MOISTURIZERS.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.996
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THEM
TO MORGAN?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.865
I DON'T NEED ANY.
I'M ALWAYS WET.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.334
I'VE ACTUALLY FOUND IT
VERY GRATIFYING

04:26.367 --> 04:28.402
DATING A SERIOUS WOMAN
WHO CHALLENGES ME

04:28.436 --> 04:29.637
TO BE MY BEST SELF.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.341
OH, YOU KNOW, I TRIED DATING
A WOMAN LIKE THAT

04:33.374 --> 04:34.975
BUT SHE LEFT ME FOR YOU.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.810
SO I THINK I'LL STAY
ON THE TRACK THAT I'M ON, HUH?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.379
YUP. GOOD PLAN.
LOTS OF LUCK WITH IT.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.613
YEAH, YOU LIKE THAT PLAN?
WHOA!

04:39.647 --> 04:42.750
HUH? I GOT A MILLION BLACK BICS
IN THIS MUG.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.851
(Mindy)
OH, NO!

04:43.884 --> 04:45.553
(Annette)
MINDY, I'M COMING OUT.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.554
OKAY.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.555
TA-DA!

04:47.588 --> 04:48.556
AAH!

04:48.589 --> 04:49.690
IT'S GOOD, HUH?

04:49.723 --> 04:50.524
ANNETTE, THAT LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING

04:50.558 --> 04:52.760
THAT RIHANNA WOULD WEAR
TO HEDONISM.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.994
OH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.863
NO.
NO.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.065
I THINK THAT THOSE STRAPS
ARE JUST NOT AGE-APPROPRIATE.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.701
WHAT?
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE DANNY.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.871
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO TAKING A RISK, HMM?

05:03.904 --> 05:06.340
SO WAS DANNY ALWAYS LIKE
CRAZY PSYCHO ABOUT RULES?

05:06.374 --> 05:09.543
UGH, DANNY WAS ALWAYS
SUCH AN ANGEL.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.812
I USED TO LISTEN IN
ON HIS CONFESSIONS--

05:11.845 --> 05:12.713
SO BORING.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.782
OF COURSE, THERE WERE
THE IMPURE THOUGHTS.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.386
ON AND ON ABOUT BIG,
MILKY-WHITE BREASTS--

05:18.419 --> 05:19.453
OKAY, HE HATES THOSE NOW.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.688
HE LIKES SMALL
ETHNIC BREASTS NOW.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.356
YEAH, WELL, I'M GLAD
HE'S WITH SOMEONE

05:22.390 --> 05:24.492
WHO PUSHES HIS BUTTONS
LIKE I DO.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.427
WHEN HE WAS LITTLE,
EVERY APRIL FOOLS' DAY,

05:26.460 --> 05:27.428
I USED TO PRETEND
I DIED.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.596
AAH!

05:28.629 --> 05:30.130
HOW DID YOU GET
NAKED SO FAST?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.565
AND THIS.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.534
AND THAT,
AND THAT.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.535
OKAY.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.137
AND ONE MORE THING.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.607
THIS IS FOR A SWIM CLASS.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.942
WELL, I GOTTA EAT,
DON'T I?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.611
WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN
A STORE CREDIT CARD?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.078
I SHOULDN'T.
MY CREDIT IS BAD.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.914
YOU GET A FUN EMAIL
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

05:46.947 --> 05:50.451
MY SOCIAL IS
637-70--

05:50.484 --> 05:52.386
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUST GONNA GET DECLINED.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.554
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MY BOYFRIEND'S SOCIAL.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.123
IT'S 743-974--

06:07.801 --> 06:09.002
UH-OH, LOOK OUT!

06:09.036 --> 06:11.004
HERE COMES SHOPAHOLICS
ANONYMOUS.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.806
I BET YOU TWO DID SOME
DAMAGE, RIGHT?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.508
YEAH, THERE WAS SOME
DAMAGE DONE.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.976
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU PRIVATELY
IN MY OFFICE?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.010
SURE.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.748
DANNY, DON'T THINK I FORGOT
MY LITTLE BLUE ANGEL.

06:20.781 --> 06:21.882
OH, MA!
A BOMBER JACKET?

06:21.915 --> 06:22.883
YES!

06:22.916 --> 06:24.552
I ALWAYS WANTED ONE OF THOSE.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.820
I USED TO PLAY
TOP GUN WEARING A GARBAGE BAG,

06:26.854 --> 06:28.489
PRETENDING IT WAS
ONE OF THOSE.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.990
MA, THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.492
IT WASN'T THAT MUCH.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.359
IT'S A LITTLE SNUG.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.561
MAYBE YOU COULD
EXCHANGE IT FOR ONE

06:33.594 --> 06:34.862
THAT'S A FEW SIZES
LARGER

06:34.895 --> 06:36.430
AND I COULD BORROW IT
A LITTLE BIT?

06:36.464 --> 06:37.898
NO, YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT OFF.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.899
OKAY.
OKAY.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.133
DANNY, YOU DESERVE IT.

06:40.167 --> 06:44.438
YOU WORK SO HARD AND YOU'VE GOT
SUCH A THOUGHTFUL GIRLFRIEND.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.873
WE REALLY CONNECTED.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.975
AH!
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MA?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.977
IT'S PERFECT!

06:50.010 --> 06:52.446
REQUESTING PERMISSION
TO FLY BY YOUR OFFICE, MINDY?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.547
WHAT?

06:53.581 --> 06:55.115
IT'S FROM THE MOVIE,
TOP GUN.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.717
OKAY,
I'VE NOT SEEN IT.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.152
I HAVE SEEN
THE PORN PARODY.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.555
OKAY, DO YOU WANNA TALK
TO ME IN PRIVATE, OR WHAT?

07:01.589 --> 07:02.590
OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.626
UM, YEAH,
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY

07:05.659 --> 07:07.961
THAT YOUR MOM'S KEEPING HER BODY
REAL TIGHT.

TO FORGIVE THE MOST
TERRIBLE OF CRIMES,

14:12.452 --> 14:16.256
THE WRONGFUL ACCUSATIONS
LEVERAGED AGAINST

14:16.289 --> 14:18.258
THE INNOCENT ELDERLY.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.927
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME
WITH THIS.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.196
OH LORD,
WHOSE WRATH KNOWS NO BOUNDS,

14:23.230 --> 14:25.632
PLEASE SPARE MINDY
THE PESTILENCE,

14:25.665 --> 14:28.435
BOILS, AND FAMINE
YOU ARE SURELY CONSIDERING

14:28.468 --> 14:29.536
RIGHT NOW.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.939
ALTHOUGH, A LITTLE FAMINE
WOULDN'T BE THE WORST THING

14:31.972 --> 14:32.940
IN THE WORLD.

14:32.973 --> 14:37.244
[ah-hem, ah-hem,
ah-ah-ah-hem]

14:37.277 --> 14:40.213
AND PLEASE WATCH OVER
DOT, RICHIE, DANNY,

14:40.247 --> 14:41.481
AND THE STRAY CATS.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.615
AMEN.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.351
(all)
AMEN.
GREAT ONE, MOM.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.521
THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
AND KIND OF POINTED PRAYER.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.657
ANNETTE, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY TO YOU, AGAIN,

14:50.690 --> 14:53.093
HOW SORRY I AM
FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.028
IT'S FINE.
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.496
REALLY?

14:56.529 --> 14:57.330
LET'S JUST MOVE FORWARD

14:57.364 --> 14:59.599
AND ENJOY THIS ROAST CHICKEN
TOGETHER.

14:59.632 --> 15:03.203
OH, AND JUST SO THAT MINDY KNOWS
THAT I PAID FOR THE CHICKEN,

15:03.236 --> 15:05.905
I HAD THE RECEIPT FRAMED
FOR HER. DOT.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.276
OKAY, THAT IS ENOUGH.
PUT THAT AWAY, DOT.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.710
HEY, MOM.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.713
THE REASON THAT I THOUGHT YOU
STOLE THE BRACELET, ANNETTE,

15:13.746 --> 15:18.351
IS BECAUSE I SAW YOU STEAL
THE JACKET THAT DANNY'S WEARING.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.187
MINDY, PLEASE STOP.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.990
I WILL NOT STOP, DANNY.
I SAW IT WITH MY TWO EYES.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.624
AND I HAVE PERFECT VISION
BECAUSE I'M STILL YOUNG.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.925
ASK HER.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.628
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?

15:28.661 --> 15:31.364
ASK HER IF SHE STOLE IT.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.968
MA, DID YOU STEAL THE JACKET?

15:35.002 --> 15:39.072
YES! YES! YES! I WALKED OUT
OF THE STORE WITH THE JACKET.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.173
WHAT?

15:40.207 --> 15:41.241
THANK YOU!
THANK YOU.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.211
IT'S JUST THAT MY MIND,
SOMETIMES IT JUST GETS FOGGY

15:44.244 --> 15:46.046
WHEN I DON'T TAKE MY FISH OIL.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.382
BUT AS SOON AS I REALIZED IT,
I WENT RIGHT BACK IN THERE,

15:49.416 --> 15:51.151
AND I PAID FOR IT!

15:51.184 --> 15:52.619
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
WHAT? WHEN?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.154
WHEN YOU WERE BUSY
PUMPING QUARTERS

15:54.187 --> 15:56.156
INTO THE MASSAGE CHAIR
AND GROANING.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.291
I DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU,
DANNY,

15:58.325 --> 16:00.193
BECAUSE I'M ALREADY
SUCH A BURDEN.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.162
MA, YOU'RE NOT A BURDEN,
OKAY?

16:02.195 --> 16:03.163
NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.531
YOU'RE MY BEATING HEART, MA.

16:04.564 --> 16:08.168
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU
COME BACK FROM THIS.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.303
SAYONARA.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.771
YEAH.
OH--OOH.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.173
YEAH, YOUR WATCH IS CAUGHT--

16:13.206 --> 16:14.341
YEAH, IT'S MY WATCH.
OUCH.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.109
IT'S REALLY STUCK.

16:16.143 --> 16:19.046
[all gasping]

16:21.214 --> 16:24.051
MAYBE THEY FORGOT
TO TAKE OFF THE TAG?

16:26.353 --> 16:27.620
YOU'RE A SHOPLIFTER?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.357
MOM, I'M QUESTIONING
MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD RIGHT NOW.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.325
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS,
MY BASEBALL GEAR--

16:32.359 --> 16:33.660
DID YOU STEAL THOSE TOO?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.595
NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT!

16:35.628 --> 16:39.299
I JUST STARTED DOING IT
LAST YEAR, HERE AND THERE.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.301
I--MAYBE I'VE JUST BEEN
BORED LATELY.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.170
COULD IT BE THE DANGER?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.138
MAYBE IT'S A SEXUAL THING.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.107
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, ITS--

16:47.140 --> 16:48.408
HOW COULD IT BE THAT?
IT'S NOT--

16:48.441 --> 16:50.110
NO, DON'T SAY THAT.
IT'S NOT A SEXUAL THING.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.411
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.414
MA, LOOK, TOMORROW,
YOU'RE GOING TO THE STORE,

16:54.447 --> 16:55.648
AND YOU'RE GONNA RETURN
THE JACKET,

16:55.682 --> 16:57.184
AND YOU'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.818
I'D RATHER NOT,
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.220
IT'S NOT ALL THE SAME
TO ME, MA.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.754
I'M SORRY, YOU'RE GOING.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.523
WE'RE ALL GOING.
EXCEPT DOT.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.626
OH, LIKE THIS TRIP WOULD APPEAL
TO ME IN ANY WAY.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.461
ANNETTE, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
THAT THE EMBARRASSMENT

17:08.495 --> 17:10.830
YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW
IS EQUAL TO THE TRIUMPH

17:10.863 --> 17:12.365
THAT I FEEL,
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE--

17:12.399 --> 17:13.700
OKAY, BABY, I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT I DOUBTED YOU

17:13.733 --> 17:15.302
BUT IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP
RIGHT NOW,

17:15.335 --> 17:16.536
MY MOM'S GONNA HIT YOU OVER
THE HEAD WITH A ROLLING PIN.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.537
OKAY,
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEN?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.106
I'LL JUST GO GET MY PURSE.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.274
JUST MAKE SURE THAT ALL
THE MONEY IS STILL IN THERE.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.575
OKAY, THAT'S IT--
OKAY, MA! MA! MA!

17:22.609 --> 17:23.743
MA, MA, CALM DOWN.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.445
(Peter)
HERE HE IS.
MAN OF THE HOUR.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.522
[phone vibrates]

17:51.504 --> 17:53.173
WE'D LIKE TO RETURN
THIS JACKET.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.708
SURE.
CAN I SEE YOUR RECEIPT?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.477
UH, I WISH I HAD ONE.

17:57.510 --> 18:01.348
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE WAS NEVER A RECEIPT

18:01.381 --> 18:02.815
FOR THIS ITEM.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.585
SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN,
MY MOM, SINGLE MOM.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.220
LET ME TELL YOU
WHEN MY DAD LEFT--

18:07.254 --> 18:08.755
THE JACKET HAS INK
ALL OVER IT.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.390
THIS WAS CLEARLY STOLEN.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.359
YES, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE IS VERY SORRY.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.693
WE ARE GOING TO GROUND HER
FOR A WEEK.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.262
YES, WE ARE.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.464
MISS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE OVER
60 IN THIS COUNTRY,

18:17.497 --> 18:18.531
YOU ARE INVISIBLE.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.333
I TOOK THAT JACKET
TO MAKE A POLITICAL STATEMENT--

18:20.367 --> 18:21.801
SHH, NO, NO.
SHUT UP, SHUT UP.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.670
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR
THE JACKET AND BE ON OUR WAY.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.338
IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF HER.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.474
THAT WOULD REALLY SCARE HER.
GREAT IDEA.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.377
I'M SORRY, BUT THIS JACKET
COST OVER $500.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.245
IT COULD BE A FELONY CHARGE.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.548
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO CALL...GARY.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.550
GARY?

18:37.584 --> 18:40.287
DID YOU HEAR HER?
I'M GOING TO JAIL!

18:40.320 --> 18:41.388
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA HAVE
TO BREAK YOU OUT.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.589
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DIG TUNNELS.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.690
MINDY CAN DIG!

18:43.723 --> 18:44.891
OKAY, LISTEN UP, LISTEN UP,
WE ARE NOT DOING THIS.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.559
WE ARE MAKING A RUN FOR IT.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.395
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
WE'RE NOT GONNA RUN FOR IT.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.762
WE'RE GONNA SIT HERE
AND FACE THE MUSIC.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.198
[slap]
SNAP OUT OF IT.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.332
DANNY, WE'RE NOT LETTING
YOUR MOM GET ARRESTED

18:52.365 --> 18:53.466
BECAUSE IT'S THE LETTER
OF THE LAW.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.434
THIS IS FAMILY.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.169
WHEN OUR SON GETS ARRESTED
IN THE HAMPTONS

18:56.203 --> 18:57.370
FOR HAVING A BAR FIGHT,
I'M GONNA DRIVE HIS ASS

18:57.404 --> 18:58.938
TO MEXICO IN THE BACK
OF A CHICKEN TRUCK.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.440
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

19:03.343 --> 19:04.177
RUN.

19:06.446 --> 19:10.483
I'M SORRY, TELL GARY
I'LL SEND HIM A CHECK.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.385
(Abby)
HEY, PETER, WHAT'S SHAKING?

19:12.419 --> 19:14.454
(Peter)
SOME HARDCORE EPIPHANIES,
ACTUALLY.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.622
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOU LAST NIGHT?

19:15.655 --> 19:16.889
YOU KNOW, I JUST--
I WENT HOME,

19:16.923 --> 19:20.360
I TOOK A SHOWER, DID THE DISHES,
KIND OF JUST WENT TO BED EARLY.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.862
BUMMER.
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS PRETTY GREAT.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.798
LOOK, ABBY, I THINK
WE NEED TO TALK.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.434
OH, NO.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.636
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CROSS AROUND AND--

19:29.669 --> 19:30.770
YOU'RE GONNA SIT,
AREN'T YOU?

19:30.803 --> 19:33.206
DON'T DO THE--
YEAH.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.774
PETER, I'VE WRITTEN ENOUGH
OVERWROUGHT BREAKUP SCENES,

19:34.807 --> 19:36.509
SO I KNOW HOW THIS GOES.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.844
ABBY, I THINK--
(both)
YOU'RE GREAT.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.279
WHOA!

19:39.312 --> 19:41.481
I JUST, I'M LEARNING
THAT I, UH,

19:41.514 --> 19:43.283
I THINK I NEED SOMEONE
WHO WANTS ME TO PUT PANTS ON

19:43.316 --> 19:44.417
BEFORE I LEAVE THE HOUSE

19:44.451 --> 19:47.220
AND MAYBE SOMEONE
WHO LIKES BRUNCH.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.822
WELL,
I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.391
IT WAS FUN THOUGH, RIGHT?

19:51.424 --> 19:53.993
OH, YEAH.
A LOT OF FUN,

19:54.026 --> 19:55.595
WELL, IF YOU EVER WANT
TO GET BAKED

19:55.628 --> 19:59.232
AND GO TO A RENAISSANCE FAIR,
THEN I'M YOUR M'LADY.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.501
WELL, THAT SOUNDS M'NICE.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.638
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.639
BYE, ABBY.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.275
BYE.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.582
HEY, PETER, WHAT'S SHAKIN'?

20:15.615 --> 20:16.649
HMM?

20:16.683 --> 20:19.018
WAS I JUST IN HERE?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.954
I'M SORRY,
I'M SO HIGH.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.358
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.760
YOU REMEMBER WE BROKE UP,
RIGHT?

20:29.896 --> 20:32.999
DANNY, GUESS WHO PAID
FOR HER FIRST SONG, EVER!

20:33.032 --> 20:35.368
IS THAT WHY YOU WERE LOCKED
IN THE BATHROOM FOR AN HOUR?

20:35.402 --> 20:36.603
MM-HMM.
THAT AND OTHER REASONS.

20:36.636 --> 20:39.506
HEY, YOU KNOW?
THANKS FOR HELPING MA OUT.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.541
I GOTTA ADMIT, RUNNING OUT
OF THE STORE LIKE THAT,

20:41.574 --> 20:44.877
I...I KIND OF GOT A TINGLE.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.913
OH, MY GOD, DANNY,
ARE YOU BREAKING BAD?

20:46.946 --> 20:48.515
RELAX, I'M STILL
ALL ABOUT THE RULES,

20:48.548 --> 20:50.417
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW,
THE NUMBER ONE RULE

20:50.450 --> 20:52.385
SHOULD BE "FAMILY FIRST."

20:52.419 --> 20:53.586
I LIKE THAT.
YEAH?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.622
I THINK THAT YOU
ARE BECOMING A BAD BOY.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.623
AND I LIKE IT.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.790
YOU LIKE IT?
MM-HMM.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.058
YEAH?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.661
DO YOU LIKE WHEN I WEAR
STOLEN MERCHANDISE?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.430
OOH.
DO YOU LIKE THAT?

21:03.463 --> 21:04.464
MM-HMM.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.600
HOW ABOUT THIS?

21:07.634 --> 21:08.635
WHOA.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.340
I GOT A REAL NEED.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.941
THE NEED TO SQUEEZE.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.008
MMM!

21:16.042 --> 21:19.546
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LIKE
THE SONG I DOWNLOADED THEN.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.047
[Kenny Loggins'
Highway to the Danger Zone]

21:21.080 --> 21:22.615
OH!

21:22.649 --> 21:24.050
*

21:24.083 --> 21:27.554
UM, I'M GONNA GO DO
PAPERWORK IN THE OTHER ROOM.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.889
HEY, GOOSE,
IT'S MAVERICK.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.824
YOU WANNA HAVE SOME SEX
TONIGHT?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.526
(Mindy)
DON'T CALL ME GOOSE!
