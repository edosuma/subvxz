Mr. Hawkins? It's Hal.

00:03.133 --> 00:04.003
Remember, a few weeks ago,

00:04.091 --> 00:05.570
in the break room,

00:05.657 --> 00:07.746
when someone left the tinfoil
on their burrito

00:07.833 --> 00:09.226
and the microwave caught fire

00:09.313 --> 00:10.662
and the sprinklers went off

00:10.749 --> 00:12.447
and shorted out
all the computers

00:12.534 --> 00:15.232
and we lost all our database
for the last five years?

He feels just
awful about it,

00:27.853 --> 00:28.941
and I wouldn't be
too hard on him.

His wife is a bit
of a drinker,

10:16.572 --> 10:18.269
What are you talking about?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.794
Jamie wins. He beat me.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.230
All those years,

10:22.317 --> 10:23.927
all those terrible things
those kids have done--

10:24.014 --> 10:26.408
it hasn't made me stronger--
it's just worn me down.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.931
Like termites eating
away at a house

10:28.018 --> 10:29.585
until all that's
holding it up is paint.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.369
I'm just paint, Hal,

10:31.456 --> 10:33.415
and Jamie knows it.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.940
You'll do a better
job than I can.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.159
I trust you.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.726
No, no, no.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.292
No, no, no!

10:41.379 --> 10:43.294
You can't leave me
alone with those kids!

10:43.381 --> 10:44.426
We had a deal, Lois!

10:44.513 --> 10:45.949
You are in charge

10:46.036 --> 10:47.690
of the spiritual
and emotional development,

10:47.777 --> 10:49.605
discipline and scary injuries.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.477
I kill spiders, mark their
heights on the door frames

10:52.564 --> 10:54.088
and supply car snacks.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.786
You walk out now and the
whole system falls apart!

10:56.873 --> 10:58.614
I can't do it, Hal.
I don't want to.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.224
I don't have it anymore.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.053
I mean, it's normal, right?

11:03.140 --> 11:05.229
People give up. They quit.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.274
Lois, you listen to me.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.537
No one is as good as you are.

11:08.624 --> 11:11.061
You took those vicious
little fiends,

11:11.148 --> 11:13.890
and you twisted and crushed them
into submission.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.413
And you didn't do it
because you had to.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.893
You did it because
you loved the game,

11:16.980 --> 11:18.503
and it was beautiful!

11:18.590 --> 11:20.288
I just don't have that anymore.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.333
Honey, yes, you do.
I know you do.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.379
You've just
lost your way a little.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.728
You just need to think.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.121
Think back to the first time

11:27.208 --> 11:28.557
you found that spark.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.081
There's got to be
some way to remember.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.868
And I'm going
to help you.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.913
So, here I am.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.610
Dad said you needed
some help on something?

11:43.224 --> 11:44.834
Francis, your father
and I are trying

11:44.921 --> 11:47.489
to remember something,
and we really need your help.

11:47.576 --> 11:51.275
We'd like you to think back
to your earliest memories.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.799
What's this
all about?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.278
Mind your own business.
Just do it, will ya?

11:54.365 --> 11:56.150
You've got
to be kidding me.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.804
My childhood was a nightmare!
I've spent the rest of my life

11:57.891 --> 11:59.414
trying to board up
that haunted house.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.763
Francis, this is important.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.504
I really need
to remember something,

12:02.591 --> 12:03.810
and I don't
know what it is.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.247
But, please, you're the only one

12:06.334 --> 12:07.552
who can help me.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.340
My earliest memories...

12:12.427 --> 12:13.820
It's kind of vague.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.822
I remember we had
that apartment...

12:15.909 --> 12:18.389
I remember it being
really colorful.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.262
Come on, Francis, honey.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.829
Please, won't
you eat anything?

12:22.916 --> 12:25.701
We've tried the carrots,
and the peaches,

12:25.788 --> 12:27.311
and the oatmeal,
the apples, huh?

12:27.398 --> 12:28.182
Don't you like anything?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.705
[blows raspberry]

12:29.792 --> 12:31.489
Lois!

12:31.576 --> 12:33.143
Would you like to know
what your son did

12:33.230 --> 12:35.406
to my director's cut
of The Eyes of Laura Mars?

12:35.493 --> 12:37.017
He also shaved a hole

12:37.104 --> 12:39.193
in the carpet
with my new Norelco!

12:39.280 --> 12:40.716
I'm sorry, Hal.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.631
I asked him very nicely
not to play with it,

12:42.718 --> 12:44.415
but he just wouldn't listen.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.982
I can't get him
to do anything.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.419
I've read Dr. Spock
and Piaget and Eisenberg,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.465
and The Language of Hugs--

12:50.552 --> 12:52.772
all these books.
Nothing's helping.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.469
What he needs
is a little discipline.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.993
I think he'd behave better
if he just ate something.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.603
[voice breaking]
Look at him.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.127
He's just wasting away.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.607
I'm going to give him
another Hershey bar.

13:02.694 --> 13:06.089
Lois, no! You can't keep
coddling him like this!

13:06.176 --> 13:08.788
I am sick and tired of always
having to be the bad cop

13:08.875 --> 13:11.399
because you're constantly
giving in to him.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.183
Okay, Hal, I'll try.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.185
You keep saying that,
and then you do it again!

13:15.272 --> 13:17.971
I'm going to be tougher
with him. I promise.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.244
Huh. It's weird.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.159
I just have this vague feeling
of you actually being

13:32.246 --> 13:34.465
a good mother.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.035
I hate you!

13:39.122 --> 13:42.299
I hate you, I hate you!

13:42.386 --> 13:43.605
I hate you!

13:43.692 --> 13:45.259
Reese, this is crazy.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.087
You've been staring
at that damn thing

13:47.174 --> 13:48.697
for four days.
We're getting rid of it.

13:48.784 --> 13:51.569
No! Wait!
I finally have an idea.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.615
-What is it?
-I'll have it in a second!

13:53.702 --> 13:54.485
Just wait!

13:54.572 --> 13:56.313
It's over, Reese.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.315
Once the board's gone, things
should go back to normal.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.622
Did you know that the Newmans

14:00.709 --> 14:02.493
put a statue of a naked guy
on their front lawn a week ago?

14:02.580 --> 14:03.930
We should be ashamed
of ourselves.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.715
No! We are not
getting rid of this!

14:06.802 --> 14:08.195
Reese, what
is the big deal?

14:08.282 --> 14:10.284
What is so special
about this board?

14:12.808 --> 14:14.592
I think it's my last time.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.116
Last time for what?

14:16.203 --> 14:19.206
For anything stupid
and reckless and fun.

14:19.293 --> 14:20.598
Maybe it's because

14:20.685 --> 14:22.339
I'm almost 18 now,

14:22.426 --> 14:24.951
but lately I've been hearing
this voice in my head that says,

14:25.038 --> 14:28.041
"That's dangerous.
That's stupid.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.564
You're gonna hurt yourself."

14:29.651 --> 14:31.392
And the old voice--

14:31.479 --> 14:35.744
the one that says,
"This is fun. Do it anyways.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.398
They'll figure out
how to save you."--

14:37.485 --> 14:40.140
it just gets quieter
and quieter.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.794
Pretty soon I won't be able
to hear it at all.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.494
But before it dies,

14:46.581 --> 14:48.757
I want to say good-bye to it
the right way.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.283
We'll give it
the best send-off

14:53.370 --> 14:55.285
any crazy voice
could ever ask for.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.591
I'd do it for mine.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.420
Right around the time

14:59.507 --> 15:01.770
I was starting to walk,
there was some kind of...

15:01.857 --> 15:03.076
Uh...

15:03.163 --> 15:06.209
I don't know. Let's stop.
I want to stop.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.864
Honey, please, keep going.
You can't stop now.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.866
No! I don't want to.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.433
We've been sitting here
for five hours.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.956
Why are we doing this, anyway?

15:14.043 --> 15:15.740
Francis, please.
I think we're really close.

15:15.827 --> 15:16.785
Just one more time.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.830
Well... I kind of remember

15:18.918 --> 15:21.659
that Frisbee game
we used to play...

15:24.053 --> 15:26.012
Okay, honey.
Maybe we'll eat later.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.059
Lois, did you see what he did
in there?

15:30.146 --> 15:31.582
He used my tennis racket

15:31.669 --> 15:34.324
to smash my camera
and all my lenses to bits!

15:34.411 --> 15:36.979
I still had film in it
from the US Festival!

15:38.676 --> 15:39.895
Where is he?

15:39.982 --> 15:42.637
Hal, it's not his fault!

15:42.724 --> 15:44.160
I'm pretty sure
he's working through

15:44.247 --> 15:46.032
a limitation-anxiety phase.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.859
All the literature says this is
the age where he's trying...

15:47.947 --> 15:51.211
You cannot undermine me every
time I try to discipline him!

15:51.298 --> 15:53.604
I can't help it.
He's so small and helpless.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.737
I can't take any more of this!

15:55.824 --> 15:57.391
It is tearing
our marriage apart!

15:57.478 --> 16:00.437
For his own good,
you have got to buckle down!

16:03.005 --> 16:04.833
Do you understand me, Lois?

16:04.920 --> 16:09.185
You have to find some way
to be this boy's mother!

16:16.410 --> 16:17.715
Hello, Dr. Sachs.
It's Lois again.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.326
I know I just called, but...

16:19.413 --> 16:20.805
my husband yelled at me again

16:20.892 --> 16:22.416
about being stricter
with Francis,

16:22.503 --> 16:24.026
and I wanted to know
if you could write me a note

16:24.113 --> 16:25.854
saying that yelling at him
could damage his psyche?

16:25.941 --> 16:28.552
It's such a tender time
for Francis.

16:28.639 --> 16:32.556
He's so fragile and unformed
and I just want to make sure

16:32.643 --> 16:35.255
I get it right,
but everything I do feels wrong.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.213
If this is all supposed
to be so natural,

16:37.300 --> 16:38.562
why can't I get this?

16:38.649 --> 16:40.651
[sobbing]
I love him so much

16:40.738 --> 16:42.566
and I want to be a good mother

16:42.653 --> 16:46.657
and I know I have
to be stronger, but I just

16:46.744 --> 16:47.963
don't think
I can look in his eyes

16:48.050 --> 16:49.486
and not give him what he wants.

16:49.573 --> 16:53.882
He has such a sweet little face,
and he's so innocent.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.369
I'm going
to have to call you back.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.598
Fire... is... dangerous.

17:25.827 --> 17:28.047
Fire can hurt you.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.614
Fire can kill you.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.747
I will not let that happen.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.794
Let me make one thing clear.

17:36.881 --> 17:40.450
I love you, and I will do
whatever I have to

17:40.537 --> 17:42.931
to take care of you,
and keep you safe

17:43.018 --> 17:45.194
and happy and alive.

17:45.281 --> 17:49.459
I don't care if you
grow up to hate me,
but you will understand this:

17:49.546 --> 17:53.637
I will... do... anything.

17:54.986 --> 17:58.077
That is how much I love you.

18:23.754 --> 18:24.842
Yes. That's right.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.540
It's coming back to me;

18:26.627 --> 18:30.370
that sense of strength
and power and purpose.

18:30.457 --> 18:34.243
I finally knew who I was,
and what I was born to be.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.766
Honey, you're back!

18:35.853 --> 18:36.767
BOTH:
Oh!

18:36.854 --> 18:38.769
I knew you could do it!

18:38.856 --> 18:40.728
[blubbering]
Mr. Fuzzles!

18:40.815 --> 18:42.730
[sobbing]

18:42.817 --> 18:44.601
Thank you, Francis.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.255
You can go now.

18:49.432 --> 18:50.868
What? What is it?

18:50.955 --> 18:53.480
We've got something for you.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.482
Dewey and I finally came up
with something good enough

18:55.569 --> 18:57.136
for that insane voice
in your head.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.486
Here. Put
this on first.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.270
Roman candles?

19:01.357 --> 19:02.837
Well, that's how
they started off.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.970
We decided to give 'em
a little more... oomph.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.798
Do you care if you keep
your eyebrows?

19:07.885 --> 19:10.018
-Hell, no!
-Okay, the fuse is timed

19:10.105 --> 19:11.150
for 20 seconds.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.542
You're gonna light it,

19:12.629 --> 19:15.458
and then get up on the board
and jump.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.026
The rockets should kick in
around there.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.332
They won't give you
any momentum,

19:19.419 --> 19:20.724
but they will ignite that.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.861
Hopefully, you will land
in that kiddie pool.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.254
We think that's got
a 50-50 shot

19:28.341 --> 19:29.777
of putting you out.

19:29.864 --> 19:30.821
If the roof
doesn't collapse.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.736
Or ignite.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.955
And it's all
gonna be caught

19:34.042 --> 19:35.348
on that video camera.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.785
It has a direct feed
to the Internet.

19:37.872 --> 19:41.963
You're the featured page
on GiantJackass.com.

19:43.399 --> 19:46.794
This is more than anything
I could have ever asked for.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.535
Nobody deserves it
more than you.

20:15.649 --> 20:16.650
[screams]

20:32.883 --> 20:35.016
Should I get the hose?

20:35.103 --> 20:36.322
Not yet.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.801
He would've wanted
us to wait.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.677
Good boy.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.766
You finished all your peas!

20:47.420 --> 20:48.551
Hey, slugger.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.379
Guess what.
The clinic called.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.990
They said my ass
was a perfect match
for your hand.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.731
They can start
the skin grafts next week.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.255
[chuckles]

21:02.609 --> 21:04.175
