00:01.857 --> 00:04.018
Do not try
any of the experiments

00:04.093 --> 00:06.027
you are about to see
at home.

00:06.095 --> 00:09.155
You heard him.
Don't do it.

00:11.233 --> 00:14.760
On this bone-breaking
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:14.837 --> 00:16.566
I fell down I was so excited.

00:16.639 --> 00:19.335
<i>...can a pile
of antacid pills</i>

00:19.408 --> 00:21.569
really help blast a man
out of jail?

00:21.644 --> 00:24.169
Prison can do funny things
to a guy.

00:24.246 --> 00:27.079
<i>The fizz packs a punch.</i>

00:27.149 --> 00:30.118
But is it enough
to crack solid concrete?

00:30.186 --> 00:31.778
This is the big one.

00:33.322 --> 00:35.415
Whoa!

00:35.491 --> 00:36.583
<i>Then we turn out the lights</i>

00:36.659 --> 00:38.286
on the struggle to smuggle.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.453
Let's go blind some drivers.

00:40.529 --> 00:43.862
<i>Can an outlaw cash in
by crashing the border</i>

00:43.933 --> 00:47.528
at night without headlights?

00:47.603 --> 00:49.070
That sucked.

00:49.138 --> 00:51.368
<i>And assuming it works...
... What?</i>

00:51.440 --> 00:53.908
Would anyone live
to tell the tale?

00:58.113 --> 00:59.978
<i>Who are the Mythbusters?</i>

01:00.049 --> 01:02.609
Adam Savage...
... I feel perfectly normal.

01:02.685 --> 01:05.313
...and Jamie Hyneman.
... Pain is your friend.

01:05.387 --> 01:10.290
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:10.359 --> 01:13.760
Joining them...
Grant Imahara...

01:13.829 --> 01:14.853
Burn!

01:14.930 --> 01:15.988
...Kari Byron...

01:16.065 --> 01:17.225
I'm starting
to get the idea

01:17.299 --> 01:18.732
that this shouldn't
be done inside.

01:18.801 --> 01:20.132
...Tory Belleci...

01:21.303 --> 01:22.668
...and featuring Jessi Combs.

01:22.738 --> 01:23.796
That was awesome!

01:23.872 --> 01:26.568
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:27.977 --> 01:30.411
They put them to the test.

01:46.295 --> 01:47.455
Big night last night?

01:47.529 --> 01:49.326
No.
This is a brain teaser.

01:49.398 --> 01:51.730
What can you do
with these items?

01:51.800 --> 01:54.098
...You mean besides cure a hangover?
... Yeah.

01:54.169 --> 01:55.602
I don't know.
I'll bite.

01:55.671 --> 01:56.899
What can you do?

01:56.972 --> 01:58.337
You can
break out of jail.

01:58.407 --> 01:59.431
No!

01:59.508 --> 02:00.532
Yeah.

02:00.609 --> 02:02.668
The myth is
that an industrious inmate

02:02.745 --> 02:05.509
lined the inside of his
cell wall with sheet plastic,

02:05.581 --> 02:06.809
and he had collected

02:06.882 --> 02:09.282
something like 10 years worth
of antacid tablets,

02:09.351 --> 02:11.148
which he exposed to water,

02:11.220 --> 02:14.246
creating enough CO2
to pressurize the cell

02:14.323 --> 02:16.484
and break the cell walls,
and he escaped.

02:16.558 --> 02:18.423
I love it.

02:18.494 --> 02:20.121
<i>What's not to love?</i>

02:20.195 --> 02:22.390
For instant freedom,
just add water.

02:22.464 --> 02:25.228
But can the massive amount
of CO2 produced

02:25.301 --> 02:27.235
from a pile of bubbling tablets

02:27.303 --> 02:29.635
really budge bricks and mortar?

02:29.705 --> 02:33.106
We'll need to capture
every ounce of energy

02:33.175 --> 02:35.302
from a giant chemical belch.

02:35.377 --> 02:36.867
Well, I reckon
the best place to start

02:36.945 --> 02:38.503
is to figure out
what kind of pressures

02:38.580 --> 02:40.104
we can get out of antacid
tablets here in the shop.

02:40.182 --> 02:41.240
I think you're right.

02:41.317 --> 02:44.081
Maybe we should start out
on small scale

02:44.153 --> 02:45.950
and see what we're dealing with
with the pressures,

02:46.021 --> 02:47.682
the physics, the chemistry,
that kind of thing.

02:47.756 --> 02:49.883
Yeah, we're definitely gonna
need all of that information

02:49.958 --> 02:50.982
before we go
full-scale.

02:55.497 --> 02:57.727
Before anyone
breaks out the beakers,

02:57.800 --> 03:00.633
they'll need to start building
a full-scale cell,

03:00.703 --> 03:03.467
which should be as tough
as its tenant.

03:03.539 --> 03:05.803
While normally
people go to great lengths

03:05.874 --> 03:07.102
to avoid a prison cell,

03:07.176 --> 03:09.508
we've actually
had to go to great lengths

03:09.578 --> 03:11.045
to get up and cozy with one.

03:11.113 --> 03:13.343
<i>In fact,
it's far and away</i>

03:13.415 --> 03:15.212
the sturdiest shack we've built.

03:15.284 --> 03:18.515
It's a cozy 10-feet long
by 7-feet wide

03:18.587 --> 03:23.047
by 61/2-feet high...
maximum security cell.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.457
He's got a lot better
technique than I do.

03:25.527 --> 03:26.892
That's pretty clear.

03:26.962 --> 03:28.827
You're all like throwing it
and stuff.

03:28.897 --> 03:30.194
I'm kind of impressed.

03:30.265 --> 03:31.823
It is pretty to watch.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.232
And, hey, these guys are fast.

03:35.771 --> 03:38.296
This professional help thing
is pretty good.

03:38.374 --> 03:41.309
This morning we had a yellow
rectangle on the floor.

03:41.377 --> 03:43.607
This afternoon,
most of a prison cell.

03:43.679 --> 03:46.204
<i>But the day is only
half done for Adam and Jamie.</i>

03:46.281 --> 03:47.873
It's back to M5 to find out

03:47.950 --> 03:50.384
how much
potentially explosive pressure

03:50.452 --> 03:54.718
they can hope to wrangle
from the humble antacid tablet.

03:54.790 --> 03:57.520
Jamie starts
with a volumetric test

03:57.593 --> 04:00.061
to see how much gas is produced

04:00.129 --> 04:03.189
by measuring
the water it displaces.

04:03.265 --> 04:07.395
So, you release the antacid
into here. It expands.

04:07.469 --> 04:12.372
That expansion of gas pushes
water out of this one into here,

04:12.441 --> 04:13.931
and whatever volume
we get in here

04:14.009 --> 04:15.909
is how much gas was produced
by the antacid.

04:15.978 --> 04:17.137
Ain't it great?

04:17.212 --> 04:19.077
I love it.
Let's do it.

04:19.148 --> 04:21.844
There's more than enough water
to make this work.

04:21.916 --> 04:24.283
Jamie pulls
the quick release magnet,

04:24.353 --> 04:26.981
and they're off and bubbling.

04:27.055 --> 04:29.523
Look at that.
It works!

04:29.591 --> 04:32.617
And they've got
a result in seconds.

04:32.694 --> 04:34.457
So it looks like one pill

04:34.530 --> 04:37.260
produces about 75 milliliters
of gas.

04:37.332 --> 04:38.526
Yeah. About 80.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.158
Well, now my question
would be,

04:40.235 --> 04:44.171
do 2 pills
displace 160 milliliters?

04:44.239 --> 04:47.902
Does it scale perfectly
linearly?

04:47.976 --> 04:50.968
Double the gas from double
the pills would make sense,

04:51.046 --> 04:53.674
but science
is rarely so simple.

04:53.749 --> 04:54.909
Wow.

04:54.983 --> 04:58.077
The volume of gas produced
scoots past the 160 mark

04:58.153 --> 05:00.417
and continues to climb.

05:00.489 --> 05:03.515
This one's looking
like 275.

05:03.592 --> 05:05.992
To see if the trend continues,

05:06.061 --> 05:09.588
the next logical step
is to try four pills.

05:09.665 --> 05:14.932
Double the two-pill result would
be 550 mills of displaced water.

05:15.003 --> 05:19.804
And before long, Jamie's wishing
he brought a bigger beaker.

05:19.875 --> 05:22.241
...It's actually going more than...
... More than double.

05:22.311 --> 05:25.075
It's clear
there's CO2 aplenty.

05:25.147 --> 05:27.138
But the myth depends
specifically

05:27.216 --> 05:29.275
on the pressure
the gas generates,

05:29.351 --> 05:31.182
so that's what
they'll measure next.

05:31.253 --> 05:34.586
Testing pressure
in 3, 2, 1.

05:36.658 --> 05:38.592
Look at that.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.992
They start over
with one tablet.

05:41.063 --> 05:43.657
And again,
the results come quickly.

05:43.732 --> 05:46.758
What do we get there?
1.9? 2 psi?

05:46.835 --> 05:50.566
Yeah, it's about 1.9.
Just a hair under 2.

05:50.639 --> 05:53.574
<i>Now for a mini
moment of truth</i>

05:53.642 --> 05:57.635
to see if pressure, like volume,
increases exponentially.

05:57.713 --> 06:00.978
All right,
two-tablet pressure test.

06:01.049 --> 06:03.108
If the pressure just doubles,

06:03.185 --> 06:05.779
the two tabs will fizzle
at 4 psi.

06:05.854 --> 06:08.345
Both pills are still going,
both tablets are still bubbling.

06:08.423 --> 06:11.654
2 psi passed is roundly passed.
2.5 psi is on its way.

06:11.727 --> 06:14.855
2.5 psi handily passed
by both tablets.

06:14.930 --> 06:17.194
And now rounding up on 3 psi.
3 psi.

06:17.266 --> 06:19.791
Will we get 3.5 psi?
3.5? Anyone for 3.5?

06:19.868 --> 06:22.598
Yes, both pills seem to want
to go to 3.5 psi

06:22.671 --> 06:24.298
on our way to 4.
4 psi.

06:24.373 --> 06:26.967
4 psi. Go. Go. Yes.

06:27.042 --> 06:28.475
Passing 4 psi,

06:28.544 --> 06:31.945
the expected linear expansion
rate of the two tablets,

06:32.014 --> 06:34.505
and it seems that
their expansion rate

06:34.583 --> 06:36.175
is, in fact, exponential.

06:36.251 --> 06:37.650
In practical terms,

06:37.719 --> 06:41.052
that means they might be able
to crack the jail cell

06:41.123 --> 06:43.819
with relatively few
antacid tablets.

06:43.892 --> 06:46.520
...Shall we go up to three tablets?
... Let's.

06:46.595 --> 06:48.256
I got to say,
when we started this out,

06:48.330 --> 06:50.230
I didn't have high hopes that
there would be a lot of pressure

06:50.299 --> 06:52.164
being generated
by antacid tablets.

06:52.234 --> 06:56.603
But so far, what we're finding
is actually kind of thrilling.

06:56.672 --> 06:58.640
Look at those puppies go.

06:58.707 --> 07:02.165
We're finding that if you double
the amount of antacid tablets,

07:02.244 --> 07:04.508
you get more than double
the pressure.

07:04.580 --> 07:05.979
8.2.
Okay, I'm calling it.

07:06.048 --> 07:08.414
...I'm gonna release pressure, okay?
... Okay.

07:08.483 --> 07:10.713
It seems to increase
exponentially.

07:10.786 --> 07:12.617
This could be a gargantuan
amount of pressure

07:12.688 --> 07:14.178
we can create
in this prison cell.

07:14.256 --> 07:15.951
I'm pretty excited.

07:16.024 --> 07:17.958
<i>But to make doubly sure,</i>

07:18.026 --> 07:21.621
Jamie wants to run a last set
of tests in a bigger container.

07:23.599 --> 07:25.533
I feel like
I'm defusing a nuclear bomb.

07:25.601 --> 07:28.968
All right,
place the core very carefully.

07:29.037 --> 07:35.169
Don't let the two substances
react with each other.

07:35.243 --> 07:38.371
They christen the chamber
with 20 antacid pills,

07:38.447 --> 07:43.680
hoping it's tough enough
to handle the pressure.

07:43.752 --> 07:46.243
All right, it's holding steady
at 10 psi.

07:46.321 --> 07:47.879
Shall we next
go to double?

07:47.956 --> 07:49.253
Okay.

07:49.324 --> 07:51.155
<i>If past results
hold true,</i>

07:51.226 --> 07:55.788
the pressure from 40 tablets
should comfortably pass 20 psi.

07:58.467 --> 08:01.459
Only this time it doesn't.

08:01.536 --> 08:03.834
Seems to be settling in
at 18 psi.

08:03.905 --> 08:06.237
So, we're not getting that
exponential leap we were getting

08:06.308 --> 08:08.105
in the small scale.

08:08.176 --> 08:09.837
<i>The increase was 80%.</i>

08:09.911 --> 08:12.573
That's not exponential
or even linear.

08:12.648 --> 08:13.239
So what do you say?

08:13.315 --> 08:16.250
...Should we double it one more time, try 80 tablets?
... Yeah.

08:16.318 --> 08:17.615
Cool.

08:17.686 --> 08:21.622
Seems the size of the container
does effect the pressure.

08:21.690 --> 08:24.215
Here we go.

08:24.292 --> 08:25.486
<i>With 80 tablets,</i>

08:25.560 --> 08:29.018
the gauge climbs to 20
then slows down.

08:29.097 --> 08:33.260
We might absolutely be at the
pressure limit of this stuff.

08:33.335 --> 08:34.563
Yeah,
you may be right,

08:34.635 --> 08:39.265
but keep in mind that 25 psi
is a lot in any building.

08:39.341 --> 08:41.400
In fact, I don't think
most buildings

08:41.476 --> 08:42.909
would be able
to withstand that.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.070
No, I think
you're totally right.

08:44.145 --> 08:47.240
I think if we can get 10 psi
in this prison cell,

08:47.315 --> 08:51.149
we're gonna bring it
crumbling to the ground.

08:51.219 --> 08:52.743
<i>Well, that's the dream.</i>

08:52.821 --> 08:57.485
Again, doubling the dose
only raises the pressure by 80%.

08:57.559 --> 09:01.791
At least there's a pattern,
but what's the direction?

09:01.863 --> 09:03.330
Sure, there's a lot
of fizzy goodness,

09:03.398 --> 09:05.525
but does it mean anything?

09:05.600 --> 09:06.532
Well, I graphed it out.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.933
I think it does mean something.
Let me explain.

09:09.004 --> 09:10.471
Follow me.

09:13.508 --> 09:16.636
Right, so the first test on top
was volume displacement...

09:16.712 --> 09:17.940
how much gas the tablets put out

09:18.013 --> 09:19.344
when we combined them
with water.

09:19.414 --> 09:20.403
We tested it three times,

09:20.482 --> 09:22.848
doubling the number of tablets
for each test.

09:22.918 --> 09:24.249
Now, we had an expectation

09:24.319 --> 09:25.684
that when we doubled the number
of tablets,

09:25.754 --> 09:27.517
we'd get double
the volume of gas,

09:27.589 --> 09:28.715
but this was not so.

09:28.790 --> 09:31.623
In fact, the improvement
was much greater...

09:31.693 --> 09:36.596
250% the amount of gas every
time we doubled the tablets.

09:36.665 --> 09:38.326
That's an exponential
growth rate.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.458
But what about the pressure?

09:39.534 --> 09:41.092
That was the next test we did.

09:41.169 --> 09:42.659
Again, testing it three times,

09:42.738 --> 09:44.729
doubling the number of tablets
each time,

09:44.806 --> 09:46.398
and in this, we still saw an
exponential growth,

09:46.475 --> 09:49.342
although a little less than what
we saw in the volumetric test...

09:49.411 --> 09:51.140
about 150% improvement

09:51.213 --> 09:52.771
each time we doubled
the number of tablets.

09:52.848 --> 09:55.214
Is it contingent upon the volume
we were working with?

09:55.283 --> 09:56.341
Well, we wondered that, too,

09:56.418 --> 09:58.511
so we went up to
a 10-liter container here,

09:58.587 --> 10:00.953
doubling the number
of tablets each time,

10:01.022 --> 10:03.388
and now we're seeing
much more of a linear growth...

10:03.458 --> 10:05.722
about an 80% improvement
every time.

10:05.794 --> 10:07.989
But the fact that this
is slowly dropping concerns us.

10:08.063 --> 10:09.758
What does this mean for the
full-size cell?

10:09.831 --> 10:11.321
Does this mean
that when we get that big,

10:11.399 --> 10:12.889
the volume won't mean anything

10:12.968 --> 10:15.129
and that and we won't get
the pressure we're looking for?

10:15.203 --> 10:16.795
We don't know.

10:16.838 --> 10:19.830
<i>There will be an answer
unless Adam explodes first.</i>

10:26.982 --> 10:28.279
Well, this is a first.

10:28.350 --> 10:30.045
What's that?
Doing a blueprint in the dark?

10:30.118 --> 10:33.281
Yes, but also a myth
about smuggling in the dark.

10:33.355 --> 10:36.119
And we're not talking about your
old-timey Barbary Coast pirates.

10:36.191 --> 10:38.159
We're talking about
modern-day smuggling.

10:38.226 --> 10:38.954
Well,
tell me about it.

10:39.027 --> 10:41.393
Well, according to the viewers,
what people are doing

10:41.463 --> 10:43.363
is trying to get, let's say,
maple syrup

10:43.431 --> 10:45.524
across the Canadian border
to the United States.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.225
And what they'll do

10:46.301 --> 10:48.292
is they'll pick
a very low-key border crossing,

10:48.370 --> 10:49.462
and they'll wait
till nightfall.

10:49.538 --> 10:52.006
Not just any night... a very
cold, dark, wintry night

10:52.073 --> 10:53.597
where it's almost
pitch black.

10:53.675 --> 10:54.539
They go through the border,

10:54.609 --> 10:57.772
and they do their entire journey
in complete darkness.

10:57.846 --> 10:59.177
And bam,
you're a smuggler.

10:59.247 --> 11:00.509
All right, so the myth
that we're testing here

11:00.582 --> 11:03.551
is can you drive in the dark
without your headlights

11:03.618 --> 11:05.643
at speeds
and still not hit anything?

11:05.720 --> 11:07.881
Sounds like fun to me.

11:07.956 --> 11:09.184
<i>It's a technique
that's been said</i>

11:09.257 --> 11:10.952
to be used by smugglers.

11:11.026 --> 11:13.392
Turn off the headlights,
hit the gas,

11:13.461 --> 11:17.090
race past the border,
and no one the wiser.

11:17.165 --> 11:19.861
But can it be done
in the near pitch dark

11:19.935 --> 11:21.926
without coming up proper?

11:22.003 --> 11:23.095
I don't know about this one,
you guys.

11:23.171 --> 11:24.035
I mean,
I have my doubts.

11:24.105 --> 11:24.799
It's like, yeah,

11:24.873 --> 11:26.534
your eyes can adjust to the dark
in 20 minutes,

11:26.608 --> 11:28.940
but, I mean, are they gonna be
able to process images

11:29.010 --> 11:32.537
just as fast and accurately as
if you had your headlights on?

11:32.614 --> 11:35.082
...Well, that's what we got to find out, right?
... Why don't we do this?

11:35.150 --> 11:37.846
We'll do our experiment
in an indoor go-cart track.

11:37.919 --> 11:40.717
That way we'll have control over
the light levels at all times.

11:40.789 --> 11:42.814
And we can do one run
with headlights

11:42.891 --> 11:45.086
and compare it to a run
in complete darkness.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.957
Go-karts,
high speeds in the dark?

11:47.028 --> 11:49.053
Sounds like a recipe
for disaster to me.

11:49.130 --> 11:50.358
Let's do it.

11:50.432 --> 11:53.924
<i>As always, there's
work do before the fun starts.</i>

11:54.002 --> 11:57.233
These guys are actors,
producers, and stage hands

11:57.305 --> 12:00.763
in their own
drive-in movie.

12:00.842 --> 12:02.833
The trees are strictly scenery,

12:02.911 --> 12:05.209
but wild animals
could be a deadly hazard

12:05.280 --> 12:09.046
to anyone crazy enough
to cruise the 49th parallel

12:09.117 --> 12:11.210
with the lights off, eh.

12:11.286 --> 12:12.548
Now, if you were smuggling
maple syrup

12:12.621 --> 12:13.781
across the Canadian border,

12:13.855 --> 12:18.554
one obstacle you might encounter
would be a moose.

12:18.627 --> 12:20.527
Now, I've made a moose before.

12:20.595 --> 12:21.789
However that one
was made out of solid rubber

12:21.863 --> 12:24.661
and it was designed to withstand
an impact from a real car

12:24.733 --> 12:26.291
going 60 miles an hour.

12:26.368 --> 12:29.701
Wow! Did you see how high
the moose got on that hit?

12:29.771 --> 12:30.533
<i>For the record,</i>

12:30.605 --> 12:32.971
that's what happens
when a car plays chicken

12:33.041 --> 12:34.941
with a giant rubber moose.

12:35.010 --> 12:39.003
It's a result Tory's not anxious
to replicate.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.104
I'm going with a material

12:40.181 --> 12:42.274
that is gonna break away
when we hit them with the car...

12:42.350 --> 12:45.012
so I'm gonna make the moose
out of styrofoam.

12:47.756 --> 12:49.815
Hurry up.
We need those done by lunch.

12:49.891 --> 12:51.756
<i>In fact,
the team has till nightfall</i>

12:51.826 --> 12:54.989
to ready the props for the great
syrup smuggle.

12:55.063 --> 12:57.054
The moose.

12:57.132 --> 13:00.192
<i>Grant's found a venue
that's willing to stay up late.</i>

13:00.268 --> 13:01.599
So, to put this myth
to the test,

13:01.670 --> 13:03.137
we couldn't just
go out on city streets

13:03.204 --> 13:04.603
and drive around
with no headlights.

13:04.673 --> 13:06.368
That'd be way too dangerous.

13:06.441 --> 13:07.271
To test this out,

13:07.342 --> 13:10.209
we need a venue that's
controlled and repeatable.

13:10.278 --> 13:12.508
We're gonna drive this course
in the dark.

13:12.580 --> 13:15.014
Once with the headlights on,
and then with them off.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.607
We're gonna be racing
against the clock,

13:16.685 --> 13:19.085
not against each other!

13:19.154 --> 13:23.750
And we're gonna try to go as
fast as we can without crashing.

13:23.825 --> 13:25.292
Yeah,
because if you crash,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.225
that means
you got caught by the cops.

13:27.295 --> 13:29.923
And to make sure
we don't remember the course,

13:29.998 --> 13:33.161
we're gonna drive the
first round in one direction...

13:33.234 --> 13:36.226
And then the second time around,
we'll go completely backwards

13:36.304 --> 13:39.398
because there's no way
we can remember that.

13:39.474 --> 13:40.771
<i>Sounds like a plan,</i>

13:40.842 --> 13:43.402
but let's not put the cart
before the moose.

13:43.478 --> 13:45.207
They still need
to litter the track

13:45.280 --> 13:47.805
with some natural impediments.

13:49.884 --> 13:51.749
Hiding somewhere
around a corner,

13:51.820 --> 13:55.779
our surprise moose will test
the driver's reaction time.

13:55.857 --> 13:58.690
Have to get another one. This
one's not trained very well.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.727
Yeah, that's good.

13:59.794 --> 14:02.695
<i>And dropped randomly
at the end of a straight bit...</i>

14:02.764 --> 14:03.321
Perfect.

14:03.398 --> 14:06.799
<i>...this log will test
their long-range visual acuity.</i>

14:06.868 --> 14:08.165
But that's not all.

14:08.236 --> 14:09.635
Now, our third
and final obstacle

14:09.704 --> 14:12.935
tests whether you can read a
sign and make a snap decision.

14:13.008 --> 14:16.171
Both signs have four-letter
words that begin with "C."

14:16.244 --> 14:18.974
Obviously, you want
to go towards the café

14:19.047 --> 14:21.880
and not the cops.

14:21.950 --> 14:23.941
<i>And here's
a timely thought...</i>

14:24.019 --> 14:26.351
if they can't see
in the dark...

14:26.421 --> 14:27.683
Now, I know
what you're asking yourself...

14:27.756 --> 14:29.246
wait a minute, if you guys
are driving in the dark,

14:29.324 --> 14:30.450
how are we gonna see?

14:30.525 --> 14:34.188
I'll tell you how.
Kill the lights.

14:34.262 --> 14:36.662
We have special infrared cameras
and infrared lights

14:36.731 --> 14:39.063
that will allow you
to see what we're doing.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.068
But just because
you can see what we're doing

14:41.136 --> 14:42.933
doesn't mean we can
see what we're doing.

14:43.004 --> 14:45.302
To us, it's still pitch black.

14:48.576 --> 14:51.101
<i>Ultimate success
depends on not getting caught</i>

14:51.179 --> 14:52.737
and not crashing.

14:52.814 --> 14:56.750
But a good smuggling trip
is also a fast one,

14:56.818 --> 14:59.946
so each of our would-be felons
takes one hot lap

15:00.021 --> 15:04.754
to see just how fast they are
with the headlights on.

15:04.826 --> 15:06.054
Here I go.

15:11.566 --> 15:14.558
<i>The track is tight,
and the moose is lurking.</i>

15:14.636 --> 15:17.366
But Grant's not holding back.

15:17.439 --> 15:19.930
Moose.

15:20.008 --> 15:21.168
Misses the moose.

15:21.242 --> 15:22.675
Wait for the log.

15:22.744 --> 15:23.836
Gets around the log.

15:23.912 --> 15:25.675
<i>Approaching the
finish without a scratch,</i>

15:25.747 --> 15:29.308
it's Grant in provisional
pole position.

15:29.384 --> 15:31.682
And he's going down
the right path.

15:33.788 --> 15:38.885
That was pretty cool.

15:38.960 --> 15:43.124
<i>So, first Tory
then Jessi take their turns,</i>

15:43.198 --> 15:45.098
anxious to beat Grant's time

15:45.166 --> 15:48.135
without bouncing the cars
off the scenery.

15:48.203 --> 15:49.465
Unseen by the drivers,

15:49.537 --> 15:51.368
the obstacles
are all repositioned

15:51.439 --> 15:55.375
from one lap to the next.

15:55.443 --> 15:57.502
They were all fast
and faultless,

15:57.579 --> 16:00.707
no mean feat on a twisting track
without street lights.

16:00.782 --> 16:04.980
Yeah.

16:05.053 --> 16:06.714
Lights. Oh.

16:06.788 --> 16:08.881
That was so much different
than just regular daylight.

16:08.957 --> 16:09.924
...Yeah.
... Yeah.

16:09.991 --> 16:11.720
It's way scarier.

16:11.793 --> 16:13.385
All right,
let's go check the leaderboard.

16:13.461 --> 16:16.726
What?

16:16.798 --> 16:21.098
<i>It's glory for Tory,
but just by a whisker.</i>

16:21.169 --> 16:23.262
All right, well, at least
you've got a control now.

16:23.338 --> 16:28.037
Now the hard part... it's time
to drive in complete darkness.

16:28.109 --> 16:29.440
No headlights.

16:29.511 --> 16:31.103
Have I told you guys
that I'm afraid of the dark?

16:31.179 --> 16:33.079
Perfect.

16:33.114 --> 16:33.443
This is gonna be funny.

16:34.349 --> 16:35.976
Stage one of our test cell
is complete.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.575
The walls are up,
but they are hollow.

16:38.653 --> 16:39.881
And in a prison,
they're not hollow.

16:39.954 --> 16:42.980
Soon, we will fill them with
rebar and concrete

16:43.057 --> 16:45.958
and cap it off with
a cast concrete roof.

16:47.729 --> 16:50.061
We decided to make
the roof as strong as we can

16:50.131 --> 16:51.564
because what
we're really testing here

16:51.633 --> 16:53.294
is the strength of the walls,

16:53.368 --> 16:56.303
and we can't do that
if the roof breaks first,

16:56.371 --> 16:57.429
so we've done
a proper job of it.

16:57.505 --> 16:59.268
We've brought in a cement truck,

16:59.340 --> 17:02.366
and the whole thing is gonna be
steel-reinforced with rebar,

17:02.443 --> 17:04.707
and again, we're relying
on the skills of people

17:04.779 --> 17:08.044
who normally do this kind of
thing for a living.

17:08.116 --> 17:09.708
<i>When quick-set sets,</i>

17:09.784 --> 17:13.242
Adam ups the realism by adding
some basic amenities.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.311
It's not every day
a toilet's installed

17:15.390 --> 17:18.757
just for the ambience.

17:18.826 --> 17:21.818
Then Jamie brings in
that most crucial of fittings...

17:21.896 --> 17:27.027
a custom-built door
that's as strong as the cell.

17:27.101 --> 17:29.126
I built this door
out of a solid piece

17:29.204 --> 17:31.638
of 11/4-inch
bullet-resistant plastic.

17:31.706 --> 17:33.298
That's exactly the same material

17:33.374 --> 17:36.241
we use for the panels
in our blast screens.

17:36.311 --> 17:39.610
It's set inside a heavy steel
frame with very solid hinges.

17:39.681 --> 17:41.706
In fact,
I bet this is actually stronger

17:41.783 --> 17:44.251
than a normal jail door.

17:44.319 --> 17:46.184
Look at that...
it's actually fitting.

17:48.590 --> 17:50.387
They're not getting out.
Let's go.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.086
Okay.

17:53.161 --> 17:54.560
<i>With the cell now complete,</i>

17:54.629 --> 17:57.257
that just leaves
the giant plastic bag,

17:57.332 --> 18:01.632
and that's something they'll
first test back in the shop.

18:01.703 --> 18:03.967
Previous tests showed
that doubling the tablets

18:04.038 --> 18:07.405
won't quite
double the pressure.

18:07.475 --> 18:12.242
We might absolutely be at the
pressure limit of this stuff.

18:12.313 --> 18:14.679
But the boys are aware
that the psi needed

18:14.749 --> 18:20.745
to breach those jail walls
could be as low as 5 or 10.

18:20.822 --> 18:21.914
All right then.

18:21.990 --> 18:24.788
100 tablets, here we come.

18:24.859 --> 18:27.851
<i>It's a gamble they're
betting will break the tank,</i>

18:27.929 --> 18:31.057
as Adam supplies
the wannabe escapees.

18:31.132 --> 18:34.863
So, our prisoner lined the
inside of his cell with plastic

18:34.936 --> 18:38.804
to seal it, and we've replicated
that here in this small scale.

18:38.873 --> 18:41.808
We've got 100 tablets,
we've got some water,

18:41.876 --> 18:43.275
and we've got the plastic bag,

18:43.344 --> 18:44.402
and we're looking to see

18:44.479 --> 18:48.779
how that plastic
interacts with this bo x.

18:48.850 --> 18:52.183
<i>So, with a shimmy
and a shake...</i>

18:52.253 --> 18:54.483
There you go.

18:54.555 --> 18:56.785
...they're set to pop.

19:00.828 --> 19:03.058
...That was fast! Are you okay?
... Yeah.

19:06.768 --> 19:08.167
Turns out it was a little
harder to dump over

19:08.236 --> 19:10.534
a cup of water inside this thing
than we anticipated,

19:10.605 --> 19:15.838
and that made me hold on
to it a couple seconds too long.

19:15.910 --> 19:19.311
<i>Ah, the joys
of practical science.</i>

19:19.380 --> 19:22.406
On a happier note, while
the underside panel is busted,

19:22.483 --> 19:25.384
the myth is far from it.

19:25.453 --> 19:27.216
This tells me exactly what
I knew about the pressures,

19:27.288 --> 19:30.086
which is they can get quite high
in an enclosed space.

19:30.158 --> 19:33.491
And that speaks very well for us
going full-scale.

19:33.561 --> 19:34.493
<i>But first up,</i>

19:34.562 --> 19:37.258
that last test
is well worth repeating,

19:37.332 --> 19:39.527
this time with thicker glass.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.468
...You ready?
... Do it!

19:43.538 --> 19:46.507
With a flick of the wrist,
the process begins.

19:46.574 --> 19:49.202
Now, for all you who think
that dogs can sense danger,

19:49.277 --> 19:51.268
let's freeze it right here.

19:51.346 --> 19:53.576
That's Jamie's dog Zero

19:53.648 --> 19:57.607
who just changed her mind
about coming downstairs.

19:57.685 --> 19:59.380
I can see it bowing up
on top.

20:01.556 --> 20:03.456
There it goes!

20:05.760 --> 20:07.955
Oh, look...
they actually escaped.

20:08.029 --> 20:11.760
They did!

20:11.833 --> 20:14.768
Okay, a glass tank
is not a concrete cell,

20:14.836 --> 20:17.999
but the figures
are all adding up.

20:18.072 --> 20:19.903
This is good.
I'm psyched.

20:19.974 --> 20:22.306
The pressures are real.

20:22.377 --> 20:23.969
I don't think
there's anything to do now

20:24.045 --> 20:26.070
but go whole hog
on this puppy.

20:31.252 --> 20:33.914
<i>As if smuggling
wasn't risky enough,</i>

20:33.988 --> 20:36.183
Tory, Grant, and Jessi
have found a way

20:36.257 --> 20:38.122
to double the danger.

20:40.395 --> 20:43.125
They've clocked their times
with headlights on.

20:43.197 --> 20:46.860
Now it's time for lights out.

20:46.934 --> 20:48.333
My prediction for what
it's gonna be like

20:48.403 --> 20:50.337
without headlights?

20:50.405 --> 20:51.372
Impossible.

20:51.439 --> 20:54.135
It's gonna be really,
really crazy.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.540
Considering that I can't
even walk around this course

20:56.611 --> 21:00.513
in the dark, Grant's chances of
making it through the course

21:00.581 --> 21:04.881
in the go-kart, I think,
are not gonna be good.

21:04.952 --> 21:07.352
<i>But Grant can
improve his odds of survival</i>

21:07.422 --> 21:09.322
by sitting in solitary.

21:09.390 --> 21:11.688
In a few minutes,
his pupil will dilate,

21:11.759 --> 21:16.253
allowing more light
to pass through to the retina.

21:16.330 --> 21:17.991
But there's more to it
than that,

21:18.065 --> 21:20.795
as the guys found out
on the Pirate Special.

21:20.868 --> 21:22.335
Ow!

21:22.403 --> 21:24.371
All right, so we were trying
to see if a pirate's eye patch

21:24.439 --> 21:27.670
could have been a kind of tool
to get instant night vision

21:27.742 --> 21:29.437
by swapping it from one good eye
to the other,

21:29.510 --> 21:31.637
and it really seemed to work.

21:31.712 --> 21:33.771
That's amazing.

21:33.848 --> 21:36.373
Apparently, one of the key
factors in human night vision

21:36.451 --> 21:40.285
is a chemical in the rod cells
of the eye called rhodopsin.

21:40.354 --> 21:42.117
It's actually bleached out
in normal light,

21:42.190 --> 21:45.785
and it takes about 20 minutes
of darkness to regenerate.

21:45.860 --> 21:49.421
So that's how long we'll spend
sitting in the dark.

21:49.497 --> 21:50.293
<i>At the track,</i>

21:50.364 --> 21:52.832
it's as black
as a yard up the chimney.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.368
How does that look?
You tell me. I can't see.

21:55.436 --> 21:56.733
<i>To counter the possibility</i>

21:56.804 --> 21:59.398
that he's memorized the track
from his last run,

21:59.474 --> 22:02.341
Grant will set off
in the opposite direction.

22:09.383 --> 22:12.352
This is one of those
things that is just so crazy,

22:12.420 --> 22:15.116
if it wasn't
for the sound of the engine

22:15.189 --> 22:17.316
and the squealing of the wheels,

22:17.391 --> 22:19.723
it would be
just like a nightmare,

22:19.794 --> 22:22.957
just these blurry shapes
rushing past you.

22:23.030 --> 22:25.555
And then wham!
Something is right in your face.

22:25.633 --> 22:29.399
I mean, it is
a totally surreal experience.

22:29.470 --> 22:30.903
I hate to tell you,
from the get-go,

22:30.972 --> 22:33.736
you went down the wrong path,
and you got caught by the cops.

22:33.808 --> 22:37.335
<i>In other words,
Grant flunked the test.</i>

22:37.411 --> 22:40.005
But can Jessi do any better?

22:40.081 --> 22:43.278
At the very least
she's confident.

22:43.351 --> 22:46.320
I'm not afraid one bit.
Kind of excited, actually.

22:46.387 --> 22:48.116
I don't know.
I'm praying for the best.

22:52.994 --> 22:55.087
<i>One problem with
those sensitive rod cells</i>

22:55.162 --> 22:58.222
is they mostly help
with peripheral vision.

22:58.299 --> 23:00.699
The fovea,
which is used to focus,

23:00.768 --> 23:02.463
has very few.

23:06.641 --> 23:08.131
It was fairly close
to what I had expected.

23:08.209 --> 23:10.700
I knew I was gonna be hesitant
stepping on the gas.

23:10.778 --> 23:13.576
<i>She missed the
moose but latched on to the log,</i>

23:13.648 --> 23:15.343
so if this was the real world,

23:15.416 --> 23:18.249
she, too,
would have crashed and burned.

23:18.319 --> 23:21.220
I think I still have the log
attached to me.

23:21.289 --> 23:22.347
<i>And now, for the man</i>

23:22.423 --> 23:27.156
voted most likely to burn rubber
in a drive through.

23:27.228 --> 23:28.593
All right, so I have been
sitting in the dark

23:28.663 --> 23:29.493
for 20 minutes.

23:29.564 --> 23:30.690
My eyes are completely adjusted.

23:30.765 --> 23:31.424
And you know what?

23:31.499 --> 23:34.093
I'm actually surprised at how
well I can see right now.

23:34.168 --> 23:36.636
<i>With nary a trip
nor a stumble,</i>

23:36.704 --> 23:38.899
Tory makes his way to the kart.

23:38.973 --> 23:43.376
The flag drops, he's off to a
start that's more like a stall.

23:44.912 --> 23:47.039
That was so hard.
I couldn't see anything.

23:47.114 --> 23:48.638
I had to get like six feet
away from the sign

23:48.716 --> 23:51.879
before I could even tell
which way to go.

23:51.953 --> 23:54.421
<i>Jessi, of course,
had the same problem.</i>

23:54.488 --> 23:57.582
But it's what happens next
that shocks the fans.

23:57.658 --> 24:02.595
The lethal lack of light
has turned Tory timid.

24:02.663 --> 24:03.960
You cannot see anything.

24:04.031 --> 24:06.056
I mean, you see shapes
here and there.

24:06.133 --> 24:07.065
You have no idea.

24:07.134 --> 24:09.500
You're gonna crash into
something at any moment.

24:09.570 --> 24:11.731
The fact I didn't
hit the moose or the log,

24:11.806 --> 24:13.865
I think I just got lucky.

24:13.941 --> 24:17.206
<i>Tory was
far and away the slowest.</i>

24:17.278 --> 24:19.576
Then again, he's the only one
who didn't crash

24:19.647 --> 24:21.945
or drive straight to the cops.

24:22.016 --> 24:23.074
I'm the only one
that made the delivery,

24:23.150 --> 24:24.913
but, I mean,
look how long it took me.

24:24.986 --> 24:26.977
With a lap that was
four times longer

24:27.054 --> 24:31.423
than his effort with headlights,
this myth is veering off course.

24:31.492 --> 24:35.929
Then Jessi decides to steer
straight for the cliff.

24:35.997 --> 24:37.828
We're missing
one huge thing here.

24:37.898 --> 24:38.796
What's that?

24:38.866 --> 24:41.426
What happens when a car comes
in oncoming direction

24:41.502 --> 24:43.060
and shines their headlights
right in our face?

24:43.137 --> 24:44.195
You know,
that's a good point.

24:44.271 --> 24:46.466
That would totally ruin
your night vision.

24:46.540 --> 24:47.905
<i>It sure would.</i>

24:47.975 --> 24:50.443
And in the interest
of proper procedure,

24:50.511 --> 24:52.502
we're about to put that
to the test.

24:53.648 --> 24:56.412
<i>Over the years, we've
tried several ingenious methods</i>

24:56.484 --> 24:59.078
to break loose
from the calaboose.

24:59.153 --> 25:00.711
I'm busting out of here,
see?

25:00.788 --> 25:03.086
<i>We've used human hair...</i>

25:03.157 --> 25:05.091
Horses...

25:05.159 --> 25:06.592
Cannons...

25:06.661 --> 25:09.687
Even salsa
in a generally futile attempt

25:09.764 --> 25:12.824
to release a man
on his own recognizance.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.424
Freedom.

25:14.502 --> 25:17.630
<i>An antacid explosion
might just be the craziest,</i>

25:17.705 --> 25:22.074
but if someone stashed 2 pills
per meal over 10 years,

25:22.143 --> 25:26.011
that's 22,000 tabs
ready to blow.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.514
What makes us imagine that
22,000 of these little puppies

25:28.582 --> 25:30.243
has any chance
of breaking us out

25:30.317 --> 25:33.252
of a steel-reinforced,
poured-concrete jail cell?

25:33.320 --> 25:36.517
After all, in the shop, we got
pressures up to 42 psi,

25:36.590 --> 25:40.424
and how is 42 pounds of anything
gonna break out of this wall?

25:40.494 --> 25:41.358
I'll tell you.

25:41.429 --> 25:44.796
It's all about a little thing we
like to call a distributed load.

25:44.865 --> 25:46.059
Allow me to demonstrate.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.624
<i>And, yes,
you can try this at home.</i>

25:48.703 --> 25:50.898
Now, when I blow against a
surface area of one square inch,

25:50.971 --> 25:55.431
I'm able to lift a maximum
of 1.1 pounds with my breath.

25:59.814 --> 26:02.305
<i>But expelled inside
of a plastic bag</i>

26:02.383 --> 26:04.317
with a vast surface area,

26:04.385 --> 26:07.252
that lung full of air
can work miracles.

26:07.321 --> 26:09.915
Now, over an area
of 100 square inches,

26:09.990 --> 26:14.927
all of a sudden
I can lift 125 pounds.

26:14.995 --> 26:17.828
<i>And that's probably
more than Adam can bench press.</i>

26:31.078 --> 26:33.876
I fell down I was so excited!

26:33.948 --> 26:35.472
<i>And so, back to work.</i>

26:35.549 --> 26:38.040
While Jamie tapes over
the bumps and sharp edges,

26:38.119 --> 26:41.111
Adam gets technical.

26:41.188 --> 26:42.382
Right about now,
I bet you're wondering

26:42.456 --> 26:44.287
how we're gonna monitor
what kind of pressures

26:44.358 --> 26:46.189
we might be getting
from our antacid tablets

26:46.260 --> 26:48.160
during the experiment.

26:48.229 --> 26:49.560
This is how.

26:49.630 --> 26:50.824
One of the most sensitive
gauge clusters

26:50.898 --> 26:52.126
we've ever put together
for the show,

26:52.199 --> 26:54.292
it measures everything
from the lowly sensitive

26:54.368 --> 26:58.964
0-5 pounds per square inch
all the way up to 200 pounds.

26:59.039 --> 27:02.304
Now, if we get anywhere close
to this, I'm running.

27:02.376 --> 27:05.038
<i>And now, with the help
of some double-sided tape,</i>

27:05.112 --> 27:08.809
Jamie and Adam start piecing
together that vital component...

27:08.883 --> 27:12.341
the big plastic bubble.

27:12.419 --> 27:14.114
This is working great.

27:14.188 --> 27:15.587
So far.

27:15.656 --> 27:17.146
<i>It looks less and less likely</i>

27:17.224 --> 27:20.682
that one desperate jailbird
could manage all this...

27:20.761 --> 27:22.922
building the bubble or even
devising a way

27:22.997 --> 27:25.465
to get the water
from the sink to the stack,

27:25.533 --> 27:28.331
but this is a case
of not letting a good story

27:28.402 --> 27:30.632
get in the way of the facts.

27:32.740 --> 27:33.707
I don't know, man.

27:33.774 --> 27:35.867
You know how you think about
something like this for ages,

27:35.943 --> 27:39.140
but when you finally start to
do it it becomes really real?

27:39.213 --> 27:40.407
I mean, in addition
to actually real,

27:40.481 --> 27:41.812
but real in your head.

27:41.882 --> 27:44.476
I'm starting to feel like
this may work.

27:44.552 --> 27:47.350
Yeah, well, prison can do
funny things to a guy.

27:49.256 --> 27:51.087
What is Buster doing
outside this bag?

27:51.158 --> 27:52.682
There's actually a very good
reason for it.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.490
The fact is that when antacid
tablets react with water,

27:55.563 --> 27:58.054
one of the by-products
is carbon dio xide.

27:58.132 --> 27:59.190
And if you're in a bag

27:59.266 --> 28:00.824
with the carbon dio xide
by-product

28:00.901 --> 28:03.461
of 22,000 tablets of antacid,

28:03.537 --> 28:05.903
there's very high risk
of suffocation,

28:05.973 --> 28:08.032
so Buster is up against
the doorjamb

28:08.108 --> 28:10.099
to try and breathe
some fresh air

28:10.177 --> 28:12.304
while his cell
crumbles around him.

28:12.379 --> 28:15.007
<i>But now for the real
star of the show...</i>

28:15.082 --> 28:18.347
antacid by the bucketful.

28:18.419 --> 28:19.977
Okay, here you go, Adam.

28:23.157 --> 28:24.317
Thank you.

28:25.993 --> 28:28.655
<i>The tablets are heaped
'round the toilet and basin,</i>

28:28.729 --> 28:29.718
right under the hose

28:29.797 --> 28:33.858
that's been pushed
through a hole in the wall.

28:33.934 --> 28:36.300
Don't ask me how he hid these
from the guards.

28:36.370 --> 28:40.534
I haven't the slightest idea.
We're here to test the physics.

28:40.608 --> 28:41.734
I think we're good to go.

28:41.809 --> 28:42.935
All right.
Let's seal it up.

28:43.010 --> 28:44.409
All right.

28:47.214 --> 28:50.911
Will it work?
Well, the math says it could.

28:50.985 --> 28:54.546
Honestly, I have no idea,
but I tell you one thing...

28:54.622 --> 28:56.920
I'm not gonna be standing
near it when it goes off.

29:07.101 --> 29:08.159
That guy
must be crazy.

29:08.235 --> 29:10.396
<i>Jessi's decided
that driving in darkness</i>

29:10.471 --> 29:13.929
means facing the dazzle
of oncoming headlights.

29:22.783 --> 29:25.047
Grant's stand-in
for an oncoming car

29:25.119 --> 29:27.952
takes him back
to his robot roots.

29:28.022 --> 29:30.456
It's a combat robot
that I built.

29:30.524 --> 29:32.185
Mount a pair
of headlights to it,

29:32.259 --> 29:34.352
and we should be able to
remotely turn them on

29:34.428 --> 29:37.886
as well as drive around
in the oncoming lane of traffic,

29:37.965 --> 29:41.867
then finally find out the effect
that headlights have

29:41.936 --> 29:43.233
on your eyes.

29:48.175 --> 29:51.770
Good boy.
Let's go blind some drivers.

29:51.845 --> 29:53.745
<i>Actually, just one driver.</i>

29:53.814 --> 29:58.217
Tory volunteers to be
the deer in the headlights.

29:58.285 --> 30:00.344
Hey there, little buddy.
What's your name?

30:00.421 --> 30:02.548
Say hello to Blinky.

30:02.623 --> 30:04.113
<i>The obstacles are reset,</i>

30:04.191 --> 30:07.786
and Grant puts Blinky behind
the wall of the first turn.

30:07.861 --> 30:10.523
This lap could be
all over in a flash.

30:13.634 --> 30:14.862
There goes Tory.

30:14.935 --> 30:16.630
And here comes the other guy.

30:25.679 --> 30:26.839
Turn on the lights!

30:26.914 --> 30:29.439
Dude, that was so crazy.

30:29.516 --> 30:31.484
Oh, that sucked.

30:31.552 --> 30:33.179
All of a sudden,
the lights went on,

30:33.253 --> 30:37.485
and it was like an instant black
wall with two little headlights.

30:37.558 --> 30:38.923
As soon as the car
was coming towards you

30:38.993 --> 30:39.925
with the headlights on,

30:39.994 --> 30:42.428
you would be completely blinded,
and you would crash.

30:42.496 --> 30:43.622
Done for.

30:43.697 --> 30:46.530
<i>So technically,
this myth is busted.</i>

30:46.600 --> 30:50.092
They simply couldn't drive fast
enough with any control.

30:50.170 --> 30:52.400
The concept still has a chance,

30:52.473 --> 30:56.170
assuming the crims have access
to some high-tech headwear.

30:57.111 --> 30:59.944
<i>After days
of exertion and experimentation,</i>

31:00.014 --> 31:02.346
it's finally time to appraise
the legend

31:02.416 --> 31:04.907
of antacid jailbreak.

31:04.985 --> 31:08.182
So with our guys hopefully
out of harm's way...

31:08.255 --> 31:12.749
All right, antacid jailbreak,
circumstances of the myth,

31:12.826 --> 31:14.259
start the water flowing.

31:14.328 --> 31:16.023
And start
the hearts pumping.

31:22.169 --> 31:23.796
How much water
are we putting in there?

31:23.871 --> 31:26.601
We have about
350 gallons.

31:26.673 --> 31:27.935
We're not putting
that much in, though.

31:28.008 --> 31:30.067
We'll run it
as long as it takes.

31:30.144 --> 31:34.342
Fighting words from a man
in a tangerine jumpsuit.

31:34.415 --> 31:38.909
But the nostrils soon confirm
their worst fears.

31:38.986 --> 31:40.510
I'm smelling
antacid tablets.

31:40.587 --> 31:44.079
...That means we got a leak somewhere.
... Yeah.

31:44.158 --> 31:47.457
With the pressure at 0... at
least, according to the gauges,

31:47.528 --> 31:49.155
Adam ventures forth.

31:52.933 --> 31:56.664
This felonious fable
looks dead in the water.

31:56.737 --> 31:58.796
Well, I guess that means
myth busted, huh?

31:58.872 --> 31:59.804
No.

31:59.873 --> 32:00.999
I think
it's entirely feasible

32:01.075 --> 32:03.168
that we got a leak
around the sink or toilet.

32:03.243 --> 32:05.507
I think we need to remove
the sink, remove the toilet,

32:05.579 --> 32:09.572
make a really nice, pristine bag
in there, and try it again.

32:09.650 --> 32:10.776
Eliminate the variables.

32:10.851 --> 32:14.878
...Exactly.
... Okay.

32:14.955 --> 32:16.547
And eliminate they do.

32:16.623 --> 32:18.716
Out goes the old plastic bubble.

32:18.792 --> 32:22.592
There's no choice but
to build another from scratch.

32:22.663 --> 32:25.131
And Adam un-installs
the fixtures.

32:25.199 --> 32:27.224
It's decided no matter what

32:27.301 --> 32:30.236
this next attempt
will be their last.

32:30.304 --> 32:36.573
But we badly want a result, and
that means going the extra mile.

32:36.643 --> 32:38.907
What we're doing here
is preparing for phase two,

32:38.979 --> 32:42.745
where we can hopefully deliver
a lot more water a lot faster.

32:42.816 --> 32:44.841
So to install
a bigger pipe in the roof,

32:44.918 --> 32:47.318
we need to cut
a nice round hole.

32:47.387 --> 32:48.445
And the tool for this job

32:48.522 --> 32:51.491
is the incredible
carbide tipped hole saw.

32:51.558 --> 32:52.957
This is the one
Adam bought for his wife

32:53.026 --> 32:54.425
on their last anniversary.

32:55.996 --> 32:58.021
<i>The new plan
has three steps...</i>

32:58.098 --> 33:00.396
first, more water.

33:00.467 --> 33:03.231
Second, build a tighter
and better bubble.

33:05.606 --> 33:07.699
I'm ready to go.
Should we bring the tub in?

33:07.774 --> 33:08.798
Yeah.

33:08.876 --> 33:11.572
And third,
up the medication.

33:11.645 --> 33:14.671
This tub will be filled with
enough raw ingredients...

33:14.748 --> 33:16.875
citric acid and baking soda...

33:16.950 --> 33:21.353
to appro ximate
72,000 antacid pills.

33:21.421 --> 33:24.857
Add 28,000 store-bought tablets,

33:24.925 --> 33:28.190
and the magic number is 100,000.

33:28.262 --> 33:31.390
Looking at this building
and how well it's built,

33:31.465 --> 33:32.898
it actually terrifies me.

33:32.966 --> 33:36.402
I mean, with pressure vessels,
it's not like an explosive.

33:36.470 --> 33:38.165
You don't know
when it's gonna go off

33:38.238 --> 33:39.262
or if it's gonna go off.

33:39.339 --> 33:41.136
It's just... it's nasty.

33:41.208 --> 33:42.766
It's either gonna do it
or it's not.

33:42.843 --> 33:44.003
This is the big one.

33:47.147 --> 33:48.580
This is for real.

33:48.649 --> 33:50.207
Turn the engine on
and go to phase one.

33:50.284 --> 33:51.410
Release the water.

33:55.022 --> 33:58.185
Jessi, Grant, and Tory have
all but busted the myth

33:58.258 --> 34:01.227
that smugglers could drive
on a moonless night

34:01.295 --> 34:02.922
without headlights.

34:02.996 --> 34:04.759
All right,
so it looks like the naked eye

34:04.831 --> 34:07.664
just isn't up to the demands
of this smuggling mission,

34:07.734 --> 34:10.065
which means it's time
to deploy some technology.

34:13.172 --> 34:15.971
Check this out...
night-vision goggles.

34:16.043 --> 34:17.010
That's right.

34:17.077 --> 34:18.237
These babies are
state-of-the-art,

34:18.312 --> 34:20.337
third generation
from B.E. Meyers.

34:20.414 --> 34:22.712
They take available light
and amplify it

34:22.783 --> 34:24.375
into an image we can see.

34:24.451 --> 34:26.885
This is the kind of technology
I've been talking about.

34:26.954 --> 34:30.150
Yeah, so I'm gonna do a run in
the dark using nothing but these

34:30.224 --> 34:30.952
and see how I do.

34:31.024 --> 34:33.117
Okay, but this time, no
lollygagging around the track

34:33.193 --> 34:34.683
at a snail's pace.

34:34.761 --> 34:36.194
Let's make it realistic.

34:36.263 --> 34:39.630
I'll be chasing after you
like I'm the cop.

34:39.699 --> 34:40.996
<i>These night-vision goggles</i>

34:41.068 --> 34:44.299
are legal in the U.S.
but not in Canada.

34:44.371 --> 34:45.429
Still, I don't suppose

34:45.505 --> 34:48.906
that would deter
a depraved syrup smuggler.

34:48.976 --> 34:50.409
...You ready?
... I'm ready.

34:50.476 --> 34:51.876
All right. Here we go.

34:54.781 --> 34:57.909
Okay, lights out!

34:57.985 --> 35:01.785
<i>So, can technology
work where the human eye failed?</i>

35:01.855 --> 35:06.019
Tory's first few laps
are fast and bouncy.

35:09.196 --> 35:10.629
Seeing is not a problem.

35:10.697 --> 35:13.689
Being able to judge
how far you are from objects

35:13.767 --> 35:16.201
or seeing around you...
that is the problem.

35:16.270 --> 35:18.363
I mean,
it is truly tunnel vision.

35:18.438 --> 35:21.134
You have no depth appeal.
You have no peripheral vision.

35:21.208 --> 35:26.646
I mean, I must have banged into
the walls a half dozen times.

35:26.713 --> 35:29.341
<i>Now officer Jessi
gives chase.</i>

35:29.416 --> 35:31.077
And you get the feeling
it won't be long

35:31.151 --> 35:34.678
before justice catches up
with our scoundrel.

35:34.755 --> 35:36.882
And then you have the cop
chasing you,

35:36.957 --> 35:39.517
and, you know,
that's a whole new game

35:39.593 --> 35:42.585
where it's like now you have the
stress of somebody catching you,

35:42.663 --> 35:45.291
and you're having
to react quickly.

35:49.536 --> 35:52.232
<i>But what's
the ultimate verdict?</i>

35:52.306 --> 35:54.536
I mean, you can drive with the
night-vision goggles,

35:54.608 --> 35:56.269
but as soon
as you started chasing me,

35:56.343 --> 35:59.471
I had to speed up, and my
reaction time had to speed up.

35:59.546 --> 36:01.912
And having tunnel vision,
basically,

36:01.982 --> 36:03.745
I totally misjudged
that last turn

36:03.817 --> 36:04.909
and crashed into the wall,

36:04.985 --> 36:06.782
and that's when you smacked
into me and stopped me.

36:08.021 --> 36:09.921
<i>So, driving with
night-vision goggles</i>

36:09.990 --> 36:12.982
might help a little,
but less than we'd hoped.

36:13.060 --> 36:17.121
The myth is first tested
and totally busted.

36:17.197 --> 36:18.391
And is it dangerous?

36:18.465 --> 36:20.296
...Yeah. Absolutely.
... Absolutely.

36:24.504 --> 36:28.531
They start by drenching just the
pill pile with the small hose.

36:28.608 --> 36:31.133
This is phase one.

36:31.211 --> 36:32.838
Pressure is still increasing
on the plastic.

36:32.913 --> 36:34.676
I can see it moving.

36:34.748 --> 36:35.840
...Really?
... Yeah.

36:35.916 --> 36:37.178
Right in the corner
down there.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.309
<i>Even better,
Adam's gauge cluster</i>

36:39.386 --> 36:41.911
is finally
feeling the pressure.

36:41.988 --> 36:43.478
Oh, we're getting something
on the needle.

36:43.557 --> 36:49.359
Just a tiny bit.
Got maybe 20% of 1 psi.

36:49.429 --> 36:50.225
We've probably
taken care

36:50.297 --> 36:52.390
of more than half
of the antacid tablets there...

36:52.466 --> 36:54.331
14,000, 15,000
at this point.

37:00.907 --> 37:01.635
Am I crazy,

37:01.708 --> 37:04.472
or does that door seem like
it's pushing out on the bottom?

37:04.544 --> 37:05.841
...Is it.
... Is it?

37:05.912 --> 37:08.380
Look along the rail
on the bottom.

37:08.448 --> 37:11.212
The door is pressing out
on the top and the bottom.

37:17.257 --> 37:20.693
We're at just a hair's breath
under one half of a psi.

37:20.761 --> 37:23.594
Yeah, the pile
is almost entirely wet.

37:23.663 --> 37:25.255
Foam has crawled
all the way up it.

37:25.332 --> 37:27.596
I don't know, dude.
You want do what we do best?

37:27.667 --> 37:28.565
Yeah.

37:28.635 --> 37:29.897
You want to take it
to the next level?

37:29.970 --> 37:31.597
Yeah, over the top.

37:31.671 --> 37:34.401
Cue the deluge.

37:34.474 --> 37:38.274
Let's go to phase two...
turn everything up to full.

37:38.345 --> 37:41.178
Phase two is the tub
and the fire hose.

37:45.419 --> 37:46.977
If it does what it should,

37:47.053 --> 37:50.511
we're just moments away
from the world's biggest belch.

37:53.260 --> 37:54.488
There we go.

37:54.561 --> 37:56.028
Water is pouring
into our tub.

37:56.096 --> 37:57.188
Okay.

37:57.264 --> 37:59.061
Oh, we're at 1 psi!

37:59.132 --> 38:00.497
It's climbing
like a rocket.

38:00.567 --> 38:02.034
1.5 psi.

38:02.102 --> 38:03.330
Look at the door!

38:03.403 --> 38:04.665
Eyes open!

38:04.738 --> 38:06.672
2 psi!

38:06.740 --> 38:08.799
The door is gonna go.

38:08.875 --> 38:11.070
2.5 psi!
Oh, my God!

38:14.981 --> 38:17.541
We're coming up
to 4 psi.

38:17.617 --> 38:19.915
And the door is... oh!

38:23.723 --> 38:25.452
Oh, my God.
Is everyone okay?

38:32.132 --> 38:33.622
Oh.
It actually worked.

38:33.700 --> 38:35.691
Dude!

38:35.769 --> 38:37.100
Look at that.

38:37.170 --> 38:39.730
You could hear it,
and within seconds,

38:39.806 --> 38:42.366
the door started to potato chip.

38:42.442 --> 38:45.206
This massive door that I built

38:45.278 --> 38:48.441
is just, like, creaking
and groaning and curling

38:48.515 --> 38:50.039
from all of this pressure.

38:50.116 --> 38:51.845
It was agonizing to watch it.

39:00.026 --> 39:02.358
This 150-pound piece

39:02.429 --> 39:05.398
of 11/4-inch,
bullet-resistant plastic...

39:05.465 --> 39:09.731
and yet, all it took was one
6 mill piece of plastic

39:09.803 --> 39:12.203
with four pounds per square inch
of pressure behind it

39:12.272 --> 39:16.003
to deflect this door that much.

39:16.076 --> 39:17.941
And this is where it ended up.

39:18.011 --> 39:21.276
During the test, it was probably
stretched easily twice that far.

39:23.183 --> 39:24.844
<i>It's a cracker result,</i>

39:24.918 --> 39:29.685
but where does that leave
prisoner Buster?

39:29.756 --> 39:31.451
Let's posit
that's he's inside the bag.

39:31.525 --> 39:34.688
The amount of CO2
produced by the reaction...

39:34.761 --> 39:36.854
sorry, buddy, but I call
suffocation on that.

39:36.930 --> 39:40.058
And what if he's able to
actually seal himself outside the bag

39:40.133 --> 39:41.191
during the reaction?

39:41.268 --> 39:43.600
Well, I'll just
put it this way...

39:43.670 --> 39:46.662
the amount of force required
to bend this door like this

39:46.740 --> 39:51.302
is more than enough to squish
our poor inmate like a grape.

39:51.378 --> 39:54.905
<i>So the myth, like
the inmate, is all washed up.</i>

39:59.653 --> 40:01.621
I think we have
clearly demonstrated

40:01.688 --> 40:04.657
the awesome power
inside an antacid tablet.

40:04.724 --> 40:06.715
At least,
under the right conditions.

40:06.793 --> 40:09.159
Yeah, but they ain't gonna
break you out of jail.

40:09.229 --> 40:09.923
Busted.

40:09.996 --> 40:10.985
Totally busted.

40:14.167 --> 40:17.796
Yet another common household
item that can wreak destruction.
