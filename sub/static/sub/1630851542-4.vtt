WEBVTT

00:11.068 --> 00:13.482
- Hey, watch where
you're going, man.

00:13.586 --> 00:14.827
Oh, your ass.

00:27.896 --> 00:28.965
- Edmund.

00:29.068 --> 00:33.206
- [crying] E-e-e-e-e-e.

00:33.310 --> 00:35.000
- Can you cry with any
other vowel, please?

00:35.103 --> 00:37.034
- [sobs] O-o-o-o-o-o.
- No, no, no, no.

00:45.172 --> 00:48.379
- Okay, alright. Look, I'm
sorry, let me get this straight.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.344
You got fired because of what?

00:52.724 --> 00:53.827
A court summons?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.758
Oh, shit. Is this--

00:57.862 --> 01:01.896
- Yes, my mother has been
indicted in the college

01:02.000 --> 01:06.620
admissions scandal for
extortion and bribery.

01:06.724 --> 01:08.068
- What?

01:08.172 --> 01:10.413
- I got into Stanford solely
because she bribed the fencing

01:10.517 --> 01:14.241
coach into admitting me on
"an athletic scholarship."

01:14.344 --> 01:15.344
- For what sport?

01:15.448 --> 01:16.965
- Fencing, I said!
- Oh.

01:17.068 --> 01:20.241
- And I was actually passionate
and good at it for 11 years.

01:20.344 --> 01:22.724
- Okay, but you still
went to Stanford, right?

01:22.827 --> 01:24.517
You still got a
Stanford education.

01:24.620 --> 01:29.827
- Nora, I can show my face
in Silicon Valley again.

01:29.931 --> 01:32.655
My life is meaningless.

01:35.310 --> 01:36.965
Are you smiling right now?

01:37.068 --> 01:38.413
- No, this is not a smile.

01:38.517 --> 01:40.448
I'm just airing my teeth out.

01:42.896 --> 01:45.413
It's just that I've always
been a little jealous of you.

01:45.517 --> 01:48.827
Not jealous of the tail, which,
you know, I have gripped.

01:48.931 --> 01:50.241
I have done one of those.

01:50.344 --> 01:54.655
But then you became such an
accomplished, awesome person.

01:54.758 --> 02:00.000
And now seeing just how shit you
are and everything is for you,

02:00.103 --> 02:01.275
it's comforting.

02:01.379 --> 02:05.413
- I'm glad that my demise and
anatomy

02:05.517 --> 02:07.655
bring you inner peace, Nora.

02:07.758 --> 02:09.000
- Yeah.

02:09.103 --> 02:11.172
- My mind went to
some dark places.

02:11.275 --> 02:14.620
I thought about all the
bullshit and all the posturing.

02:14.724 --> 02:17.793
Like nothing I did in tech
actually benefited humanity.

02:17.896 --> 02:18.862
- Yeah.

02:18.965 --> 02:20.344
- I mean, maybe this
is my wakeup call,

02:20.448 --> 02:21.862
maybe this is the universe
telling me, "Edmund,

02:21.965 --> 02:26.620
"give back to the world
you took so much from.

02:26.724 --> 02:27.896
Give back!"

02:28.000 --> 02:30.862
I know it'll be hard, but
it's what I have to do.

02:30.965 --> 02:33.344
- Ah, man, that's so beautiful.
I'm so proud of you.

02:33.448 --> 02:35.137
What are we talking about?
Like nonprofit work?

02:35.241 --> 02:36.172
Charity work?

02:36.275 --> 02:37.862
- Acting.

02:37.965 --> 02:39.172
- Ooh.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.275
- [phone ringing]
- Huh?

02:58.206 --> 02:59.413
Damon, what is it?

02:59.517 --> 03:02.620
- Wally man, hey. Listen, I got
some bad news.

03:02.724 --> 03:03.965
I'm not sure if I
should tell you this,

03:04.068 --> 03:06.275
but it felt like the right
thing to do, you know?

03:06.379 --> 03:08.034
Are you familiar
with the dating app?

03:08.137 --> 03:10.034
Friiiingr?
- What? Finger?

03:10.137 --> 03:11.655
- Fr-iiiingr. Friiiingr.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.137
Although it's
ironic you say that,

03:13.241 --> 03:15.241
because it's how my last date
ended, if you know what I mean.

03:15.344 --> 03:16.827
- Damon, what's up?

03:16.931 --> 03:18.758
- Well, long story
short, bucareeno,

03:18.862 --> 03:22.379
I was swiping through
yesterday and, uh--well,

03:22.482 --> 03:24.724
why don't you take
a look for yourself? Hmm?

03:24.827 --> 03:26.137
- What the fuck?

03:26.241 --> 03:27.793
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Wall Man.

03:27.896 --> 03:29.689
But I took some screenshots.
- No!

03:29.793 --> 03:32.206
- I'm gonna send them to you.
- I gotta go, Damon, bye.

03:50.827 --> 03:53.344
Urgh! My back!

03:54.931 --> 03:56.103
Ow!

03:59.827 --> 04:02.172
- Acting? I mean, in this
economy?

04:02.275 --> 04:04.137
- Not now, then when?

04:04.241 --> 04:06.931
- Maybe after you secure
a stable day job? I don't know.

04:07.034 --> 04:09.448
Oh God. I sound like everyone
talking to me.

04:10.655 --> 04:12.448
- Oh, here we go,
my mom is calling.

04:12.551 --> 04:13.931
Hello, Mother. Barry?

04:14.034 --> 04:16.137
- Hey, kiddo,
you're looking good.

04:16.241 --> 04:17.586
- You too, Barry.

04:17.689 --> 04:21.379
I see the Cialis has yet to
give you stroke number two.

04:21.482 --> 04:23.517
- Edmund, why are
you in New York?

04:23.620 --> 04:25.448
You need to get back here now.
- Why?

04:25.551 --> 04:29.172
So I can testify at your
bribery and extortion trial,

04:29.275 --> 04:31.068
you demon woman?

04:31.172 --> 04:33.034
- Edmund, I know you're upset.

04:33.137 --> 04:36.068
I never meant to hurt you.
- No, Mother, I'm done.

04:36.172 --> 04:40.413
I've had no control over my life
from the second I was born.

04:40.517 --> 04:41.896
Do you know what that's like?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.724
For the first time, I'm doing
something that I want to do.

04:44.827 --> 04:47.862
- If I could just cut in, I
fully support you on your acting

04:47.965 --> 04:49.000
journey, son.

04:49.103 --> 04:51.448
- Can you shut the
fuck up for once Barry?

04:51.551 --> 04:53.172
- Yes, Barry, please stop.

04:53.275 --> 04:54.344
- BARRY: I'm just
trying to help.

04:54.448 --> 04:55.551
- Where's Dad?

04:55.655 --> 04:56.827
- KIM: He's still on business
in the Macau,

04:56.931 --> 04:58.448
but I've emailed
him several times.

04:58.551 --> 05:00.689
- On business, great.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.551
Well, goodbye, Mother.

05:02.655 --> 05:06.586
- Edmund!
- [phone beeps]

05:06.689 --> 05:08.172
- That went so good, I think.
- Yeah.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.586
- Yeah. You know what?

05:09.689 --> 05:12.310
While I don't think it's the
best alternative, Edmund,

05:12.413 --> 05:14.586
I-I will support
you on your journey.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.620
- Thanks, Nora.

05:16.724 --> 05:18.896
Because I think I may need
to crash here for a bit.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.517
- Yeah, I think Grandma's fully
prepared to make that downstairs

05:21.620 --> 05:24.103
couch all for you.

05:24.206 --> 05:29.586
- I thought maybe we could
bunk up together in your room.

05:29.689 --> 05:30.862
- Probably not.

05:30.965 --> 05:33.344
- Because we can tell nighttime
stories,

05:33.448 --> 05:35.206
or sings songs.
- No.

05:35.310 --> 05:37.758
- Or, um, when it's cold,
we can sneak hot cocoa together.

05:37.862 --> 05:41.517
Or we could get a bunkbed.
- I masturbate so loud.

05:41.620 --> 05:46.931
- Oooh. Yeah.

05:51.965 --> 05:53.344
- Decline.

05:53.448 --> 05:54.931
Oh no, here--

05:55.034 --> 05:57.517
- Wally, where have you been?
I've been texting.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.241
- You know, I'm kind
of busy right now.

05:59.344 --> 06:01.068
- Is someone
walking on your back?

06:01.172 --> 06:02.758
- I gotta go. Bye.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.206
- Oh--
- [phone beeps]

06:04.310 --> 06:07.206
- You should talk to Brenda
first before freaking out.

06:07.310 --> 06:09.758
Maybe there's a reason
she was on a dating app.

06:09.862 --> 06:12.068
- What reason could
there be except for the--

06:12.172 --> 06:14.379
- Uh!
- [groaning]

06:14.482 --> 06:15.896
- Okay, enough.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.793
I can't walk any further or
I'll compromise your pubis.

06:19.896 --> 06:21.310
You know who you should see?

06:21.413 --> 06:22.931
Susan Lee.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.896
- I don't need
an acupuncturist.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.344
- Listen to me, my friend Mei
went to her

06:29.448 --> 06:31.310
because of stomach problems.

06:31.413 --> 06:34.379
Turns out, at 72,
she was pregnant.

06:34.482 --> 06:36.034
Pregnant with a tumor.

06:36.137 --> 06:40.896
And today, Mei is still here
in Cedar Grove Cemetery.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.034
- She died?

06:42.137 --> 06:45.000
- Yeah, but Susan
is still very good.

06:57.655 --> 06:59.620
- SUSAN ON INTERCOM: Wally Lin?
- Huh?

06:59.724 --> 07:02.758
Uh, yes, it's me.

07:02.862 --> 07:05.103
- SUSAN: You may enter.

07:09.689 --> 07:11.241
- Oh, whoa.

07:11.344 --> 07:14.068
- I'm not used to having such
gorgeous patients come in.

07:14.172 --> 07:17.413
- Oh, ow. Thanks.

07:17.517 --> 07:20.517
- Please disrobe.
- Okay.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.275
- I'll leave the room.

07:26.482 --> 07:28.241
Even though I don't want to.

07:39.103 --> 07:40.758
- I can see the problem
is in your back.

07:40.862 --> 07:43.413
- Yeah, I tweaked it earlier.

07:43.517 --> 07:46.827
- Oh, Wally, you
haven't changed a bit.

07:46.931 --> 07:48.379
You're still working out, I see.

07:48.482 --> 07:49.793
- Yeah.

07:49.896 --> 07:51.310
Do we know each other?

07:51.413 --> 07:53.068
- We went to high
school together.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.689
You may not remember me.

07:54.793 --> 07:56.241
I wasn't "normal."

07:56.344 --> 07:57.586
- What?

07:57.689 --> 07:59.482
- The problem with your
back isn't structural.

07:59.586 --> 08:01.172
Your chakras are off.

08:01.275 --> 08:02.413
- No kidding.

08:02.517 --> 08:03.793
- Just like when you broke up
with Monica Santos

08:03.896 --> 08:05.172
in tenth grade.

08:05.275 --> 08:07.241
There's trouble
in your love life.

08:07.344 --> 08:09.137
What's her name?

08:09.241 --> 08:11.310
- Oh.

08:11.413 --> 08:13.862
Brenda.
- Okay.

08:13.965 --> 08:19.275
I need you to close your
eyes and think about Brenda.

08:23.448 --> 08:25.172
- Alright, okay.

08:25.275 --> 08:26.793
It's secure.
- Okay.

08:26.896 --> 08:28.758
- What are we doing? What even
is a self-tape?

08:28.862 --> 08:30.931
- It's like an audition,
but you do it from home.

08:31.034 --> 08:33.172
And instead of doing 1
take, you do like 26.

08:33.275 --> 08:34.793
And then after you're done,
you send in your favorite one.

08:34.896 --> 08:36.724
And then, "Hello, the CW."

08:36.827 --> 08:39.172
- Yeah, but these rules
are super intense, dude.

08:39.275 --> 08:41.551
They wanna shoot you horizontal?
- Yeah.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.655
- What's that mean?
- Landscape mode.

08:43.758 --> 08:45.310
- I don't think we should do it.
- Nora.

08:45.413 --> 08:46.931
A monkey could do this.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.862
- Am I in?
- You're so on that side.

08:53.965 --> 08:54.827
Frame up that way.
- Okay.

08:54.931 --> 08:56.655
- Yup, you ready?
- Yeah.

08:56.758 --> 08:57.862
- 'Cause you need
to go left more.

08:57.965 --> 08:58.896
- I'm out?
- You're totally out.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
- I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

09:00.103 --> 09:01.275
- What's my range of motion?
- That.

09:01.379 --> 09:06.241
- If you can't control
that--[screams]

09:06.344 --> 09:07.275
- Yeah.

09:12.413 --> 09:14.896
- If you can't handle that--
- No, sorry, I was on photo.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.689
Alright, here we go.

09:16.793 --> 09:17.827
- If you can't control that--

09:17.931 --> 09:20.482
- Oh my, it looks
so bad on video now.

09:20.586 --> 09:22.344
It's like a whole
different lens.

09:22.448 --> 09:23.448
- What do you mean?

09:25.275 --> 09:28.724
- If you can't control
that bitch, I will.

09:28.827 --> 09:31.206
[in Australian accent] If you
can't handle the bitch, I will.

09:31.310 --> 09:33.862
[in Scottish accent] If you
can't control the bitch, I will.

09:33.965 --> 09:36.931
If you can't control
that bitch, I will.

09:37.034 --> 09:40.172
If you can't control
that bitch, I will.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.310
- I felt that.

09:41.413 --> 09:45.034
- If you can't control
that bitch...I will.

09:45.137 --> 09:47.793
- Mm-hmm. Cut on rehearsal,
that was so good.

09:47.896 --> 09:49.413
- You weren't recording?
- No.

09:49.517 --> 09:50.448
No, I wasn't recording those.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.551
- Just breathe and
let me do all the work.

09:58.655 --> 09:59.724
- Okay.

09:59.827 --> 10:02.344
- SUSAN: I'm gonna put
it in now, Wally.

10:02.448 --> 10:03.655
- Oooh.

10:23.034 --> 10:27.586
- We're done.
- We're done.

10:27.689 --> 10:30.275
- Huh? What?

10:30.379 --> 10:33.413
- You're gonna feel
a lot better today.

10:33.517 --> 10:35.931
- Whoa. Wow.

10:38.034 --> 10:41.551
Oh, what--I already do.

10:41.655 --> 10:42.931
Thanks.

10:46.758 --> 10:48.344
- Okay, we are
really doing this.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.137
We are really doing this.
An open audition.

10:51.241 --> 10:52.758
- That's alright, here,
have some Vitamin Water.

10:52.862 --> 10:55.034
It's got vitamins and
Emergen-C in it.

10:55.137 --> 10:56.793
- This is not
Vitamin Water, Nora.

10:56.896 --> 10:58.724
- It's Mountain Dew. Duh.

10:58.827 --> 11:00.827
What else would I
put in a thermos?

11:00.931 --> 11:03.965
- What did I do to die today to
make it to two 'til two.

11:04.068 --> 11:06.827
Things--
- NORA: Oh man.

11:06.931 --> 11:09.413
There are three actors
that look just like you.

11:09.517 --> 11:10.655
And they're all hot.

11:10.758 --> 11:12.896
- EDMUND: Oh God,
oh God, oh God!

11:13.000 --> 11:14.655
- NORA: Yeah.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.448
No, drink normal.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.827
- Ed Lin?
- Present!

11:18.931 --> 11:20.137
- Ed?
- Yeah, it's my stage name.

11:20.241 --> 11:21.586
Doesn't it make me
sound more mature?

11:21.689 --> 11:23.827
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
- It sounds like shit, Edmund.

11:23.931 --> 11:25.103
Shit name, dude.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.344
- Okay, please state your name.

11:27.448 --> 11:31.689
- Ed Lin, 5'8",
5'9" in the mornings.

11:31.793 --> 11:33.379
I am reading for Jonathan.

11:33.482 --> 11:35.275
- Great, ready when you are.

11:35.379 --> 11:37.241
- I'm ready.

11:37.344 --> 11:41.172
- Connor: Ah, man, there you
go, smack talking us again.

11:41.275 --> 11:44.655
Chloe: Don't be afraid to take
home your second place trophy,

11:44.758 --> 11:49.103
boys. Didn't you leave them here
last time?

11:49.206 --> 11:52.965
- Yeah. Pft, like in my aa-ss.

11:54.827 --> 11:57.413
- That was great,
Ed, but this time,

11:57.517 --> 12:00.482
can you do that with a little
less crescendo

12:00.586 --> 12:02.965
on the "aa" part of ass?
- Yes.

12:03.068 --> 12:04.379
"Aa"-absolutely.

12:04.482 --> 12:05.344
- Thanks.

12:05.448 --> 12:07.793
And...action.

12:12.448 --> 12:13.241
- That was a cloud.

12:13.344 --> 12:15.310
That was--that was the weather.

12:25.241 --> 12:28.000
- Excuse me, you know
Brenda is a dumbass bitch?

12:30.034 --> 12:32.724
- [laughs] Sorry, what?

12:32.827 --> 12:35.000
- Do you know where
the seven stop is?

12:37.724 --> 12:39.344
Thanks.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.517
- The best piece in the
chicken, this right here.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.655
- Can't be the right place.

12:50.758 --> 12:51.724
- It's the right place.

12:51.827 --> 12:53.034
You want some chicken?

12:53.137 --> 12:54.448
- Ew no-oh, I'll take a little.

12:54.551 --> 12:56.965
- Take a little
bit...skin while it's hot.

13:01.896 --> 13:03.379
- Hey.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.724
- Hi.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.172
Is this for the audition?

13:06.275 --> 13:09.448
- Yeah, it's for
Jurassic Park, internally.

13:09.551 --> 13:12.379
[laughs] You still in?

13:12.482 --> 13:13.551
- Yeah.

13:13.655 --> 13:15.448
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

13:15.551 --> 13:16.793
- I'll be right
here, I'm not moving.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.241
I will not leave your side.

13:25.275 --> 13:28.206
- Come on over
here, hit your mark.

13:28.310 --> 13:32.068
Okay, so there's, uh,
something in front of you.

13:32.172 --> 13:33.862
I think it's an egg.

13:33.965 --> 13:36.103
You're gonna pick it up.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.000
You're gonna kiss it.

13:38.103 --> 13:39.862
And then roll it off stage left.

13:39.965 --> 13:41.241
Perfect, perfect.

13:41.344 --> 13:43.724
Oh, and now there's a little
Limusaurus Rex standing

13:43.827 --> 13:45.965
directly in front of you.

13:46.068 --> 13:48.931
You approach it in wonder.

13:49.034 --> 13:50.896
Pick it up.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.275
Hold it. Hold it.

13:53.379 --> 13:54.862
Hold it.

13:54.965 --> 13:56.655
Now you're gonna fuck it.

13:56.758 --> 13:58.344
- Sorry, excuse me?

13:58.448 --> 14:02.068
- I mean, you're gonna
kiss it on the cheek.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.482
- [watch dings]
- Oh, sorry.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.172
Oh my God, I just
got a callback!

14:08.275 --> 14:11.172
- Wait, you still
wanna fuck it?

14:11.275 --> 14:12.862
- So I'm gonna go.

14:19.517 --> 14:21.482
- Oh, yeah.

14:21.586 --> 14:22.896
Alright!

14:26.034 --> 14:27.206
- Hey!

14:27.310 --> 14:28.896
I've been calling, and
no one's answering,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.758
so I wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

14:31.862 --> 14:35.000
- Oh yeah, everything's swell.

14:36.655 --> 14:37.689
- What's going on?

14:37.793 --> 14:40.793
Is there something
you're not telling me?

14:40.896 --> 14:45.068
- That's funny, because I
was thinking that there was

14:45.172 --> 14:47.103
something you're not telling me.

14:48.586 --> 14:52.068
Damon found your
Friiiingr profile.

14:52.172 --> 14:54.689
- Oh my gosh. [laughs]

14:54.793 --> 14:56.896
What was I thinking with those
highlights, am I right?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.724
- So this is funny to you?

14:59.827 --> 15:02.724
- Oh, come on, Wally, I haven't
been on that app in months.

15:02.827 --> 15:06.206
- So why does it say
"status active," huh?

15:06.310 --> 15:07.482
- I don't know.

15:07.586 --> 15:09.931
I must have deleted the
app but not my account.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.724
- I'm just saying...

15:13.827 --> 15:16.344
if you wanna go out with
other people, that's fine.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.724
- I don't.

15:17.827 --> 15:20.275
Do you?

15:20.379 --> 15:22.482
Is that what this is all about?

15:22.586 --> 15:24.586
- Why would you
even ask me that?

15:24.689 --> 15:27.965
I'm not the one trawling
the internet for guys.

15:28.068 --> 15:29.655
- Trawling?
- Mm.

15:29.758 --> 15:30.896
- Like a shrimp boat?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.413
You're saying I'm a shrimp boat?

15:32.517 --> 15:34.931
- If the shoe fits, Bubba Gump.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.413
- You know what?

15:36.517 --> 15:38.793
I'm gonna go.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.862
- Good, yeah.

15:39.965 --> 15:41.724
Go.

15:41.827 --> 15:43.827
Fine.

15:43.931 --> 15:46.137
Goodby--
- [back cracks]

15:46.241 --> 15:50.137
- Oh, no, fuck.

16:00.724 --> 16:02.517
Who needs Brenda?

16:16.034 --> 16:17.551
- Oh!

16:21.172 --> 16:22.620
- Hi, Wally.

16:30.034 --> 16:31.689
It isn't even on.

16:31.793 --> 16:35.724
What the fuck did that
acupuncturist do to me?

16:35.827 --> 16:37.172
Ahh!

16:38.000 --> 16:39.931
- Oh-ho-ho, for me?

16:40.034 --> 16:40.896
Free?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.793
Wow, yes, take that.

16:44.896 --> 16:46.620
Legit, dude.
[sniffs] Yeah.

16:46.724 --> 16:48.034
- I know, right?

16:48.137 --> 16:49.517
I don't even know what
audition I booked this from.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.724
I did so many.
- It's your time, dude.

16:51.827 --> 16:54.103
Break a leg. I'll be in the car.
- Okay, thanks for doing this.

16:54.206 --> 16:55.931
Couldn't have done
it without you.

16:56.034 --> 16:57.482
- Hey, are you Edmund Lin?
- Yes, that's me.

16:57.586 --> 16:59.862
- Right this way.
- Wait a minute.

16:59.965 --> 17:02.965
I've only been
auditioning under Ed Lin.

17:03.068 --> 17:05.034
How do you know
my name is Edmund?

17:05.137 --> 17:06.896
- Oh, uh, I don't know.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.137
It says here Edmund Lin.

17:09.241 --> 17:11.586
And in the notes it says,
"Favor hire for mother.

17:11.689 --> 17:13.448
Don't tell him."

17:13.551 --> 17:17.344
- Are you F-ing kidding me!

17:22.517 --> 17:24.689
- KIM: Edmund,
what's the big deal?

17:24.793 --> 17:25.965
I just made a few calls.

17:26.068 --> 17:30.000
- No, I said I wanted to
make it without your help!

17:30.103 --> 17:32.551
- KIM: Honey, I'm your mother.
- No, mother!

17:32.655 --> 17:36.379
I finally realized that I would
rather get a wine opener stuck

17:36.482 --> 17:41.172
in my butthole than ever
depend on you again.

17:41.275 --> 17:44.482
From this day forward, I am
cutting myself

17:44.586 --> 17:48.793
off of your money...effective
immediately.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.068
Goodbye.
- [phone beeps]

17:52.172 --> 17:53.586
- You gotta call her back, tell
her you think

17:53.689 --> 17:54.896
that's a lot of money.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.344
Continue getting the money
and just send it to me!

17:56.448 --> 17:59.689
- No! I am going
to do this for myself

17:59.793 --> 18:02.620
without her or any help.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.620
Oh my God, did I just
make a huge mistake?

18:10.724 --> 18:13.620
- Definitely, because nepotism
is a big way into Hollywood.

18:13.724 --> 18:16.896
But then also, starting over
no money, connections,

18:17.000 --> 18:18.241
no prospects.

18:18.344 --> 18:20.172
It's bold and admirable.

18:20.275 --> 18:21.724
- Thank you.

18:21.827 --> 18:24.551
Even if it means I have to do
a million sketchy auditions,

18:24.655 --> 18:29.931
at least I'll know I
made it...on my own.

18:30.034 --> 18:32.344
[singing]
- No.

18:32.448 --> 18:33.620
- Yeah, I'll work on it.

18:35.482 --> 18:39.551
- [groaning] Oh God, it's you.

18:39.655 --> 18:42.103
- Your mom called and
said your back seized up.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.758
I just came to check on you.

18:43.862 --> 18:46.965
- I know you roofied me with
your devil needles to make me

18:47.068 --> 18:49.344
have weird fantasies about you.

18:49.448 --> 18:50.655
But it won't work.

18:50.758 --> 18:51.896
I know what I want now.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.241
- Oh, you do?
- Mm-hmm.

18:53.344 --> 18:55.068
- What do you want?

18:55.172 --> 18:56.724
- I want Brenda.

18:59.793 --> 19:02.137
- Brenda?
- Wally, have you been du-du-du?

19:02.241 --> 19:04.000
- What are you doing here?

19:04.103 --> 19:05.344
- I just told you.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.275
Your mom called, told
me your back seized up,

19:07.379 --> 19:09.896
and I came by to check on you.

19:11.379 --> 19:13.758
- Oh God, I'm sorry.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.551
I freaked out about
you being on Friiiingr.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.137
I just got so jealous.

19:22.241 --> 19:25.344
- [sighs] Well, I get it.

19:25.448 --> 19:28.724
Because I'm awesome.
- [scoffs]

19:28.827 --> 19:30.482
Yeah, you are.

19:32.103 --> 19:33.482
You're alright, dollface.

19:33.586 --> 19:35.586
- You're alright,
too, man face.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.931
- No, I'm a dumbass. Hey.
- Yeah.

19:38.034 --> 19:39.517
- My back doesn't hurt anymore.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.689
- 'Cause I slipped
you some aspirin.

19:41.793 --> 19:45.724
You know aspirin works just
as well as acupuncture.

19:45.827 --> 19:46.965
- Oh, really?

19:47.068 --> 19:49.103
That's so embarrassing
that my mom called you.

19:49.206 --> 19:52.344
- No, she's just really
worried about you.

19:52.448 --> 19:53.620
- Yeah, I'll tell
you one thing.

19:53.724 --> 19:55.827
She's always looking out for me.
- Mm-hmm.

20:02.241 --> 20:03.241
- Hey, Nora?

20:03.344 --> 20:04.655
- What, Edmund?

20:04.758 --> 20:10.482
- It's normal to
be...scared, right?

20:10.586 --> 20:12.034
- Yeah.

20:12.137 --> 20:13.517
I'd say that's normal.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.379
- Nora!
- NORA: [mumbling]

20:25.482 --> 20:27.344
- Nora!
- No, the '90s.

20:27.448 --> 20:29.103
- Nora!
- Yeah. What, yeah?

20:29.206 --> 20:30.896
- Sorry, can you
turn that down?

20:31.000 --> 20:31.862
- Turn what down?

20:31.965 --> 20:34.034
- The wrestling or whatever.

20:34.137 --> 20:35.068
- That's what you heard?

20:35.172 --> 20:36.241
- Yeah.

20:36.344 --> 20:38.310
- Yeah, I'll put it
through my phones.

20:40.689 --> 20:41.793
- Thanks, Nora.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.862
- Nora!
- NORA: [mumbling]

20:53.137 --> 20:55.103
- I can still hear it.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.655
- Who the
[bleep] is Awkwafina?
