01:40.500 --> 01:42.765
Hey, Dr. Nichols, I was just
coming down to say good-bye.

01:42.837 --> 01:44.896
Anthony, I came to help you
with your bags.

01:44.973 --> 01:48.239
That's okay. I can take 'em
down myself. I got 'em.

01:48.311 --> 01:50.279
What's... What's this?

01:50.347 --> 01:52.816
What's going on?

01:56.156 --> 01:59.957
Well, see, my friend Dignan didn't
realize this was a voluntary hospital...

02:00.028 --> 02:03.260
and he got this whole
escape thing worked out.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.598
He just got
so excited about the thing...

02:05.669 --> 02:08.662
I didn't have the heart
to tell him...

02:08.741 --> 02:11.267
no, that...

02:16.552 --> 02:18.486
Look how excited he is.

02:23.095 --> 02:26.259
I gotta do it this way, Dr. Nichols.
I gotta climb out.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.098
It's only one floor down.

02:29.170 --> 02:31.765
Okay. But can you do it fast?

02:31.841 --> 02:36.542
You know, this doesn't look good.
None of this looks good at all.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.311
Well, thanks very much, Dr. Nichols.

02:39.386 --> 02:42.982
You've really been a great help.
You've been a great doctor.

02:43.057 --> 02:45.583
Well, thank you.

02:47.230 --> 02:49.164
Can you hand me my bag, please?

02:52.905 --> 02:55.170
See ya.

02:55.242 --> 02:58.178
Hey, Anthony, don't try
to save everybody, okay?

02:58.246 --> 03:00.214
Okay, I won't.

03:03.054 --> 03:04.612
Dennis!

03:08.061 --> 03:10.656
- See ya later, Felicia.
- Hey, Anthony. Thanks for everything.

03:10.731 --> 03:13.166
- Good-bye. Take care.
- Bye, Barbara.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.669
- See ya, Chris.
- Thanks, Anthony.

03:15.738 --> 03:19.266
Come on. Any problems?
Yes! Wonderful.

03:19.344 --> 03:21.540
Wait, wait.
Who'd you get to do that?

03:21.614 --> 03:24.482
Did you bribe the janitor?
Smart.

03:33.632 --> 03:35.566
- Driver, what's our E.T.A.?
- 7:30.

03:35.635 --> 03:38.434
Good. We're on schedule. Here's
our agenda for the next few months.

03:38.505 --> 03:41.566
- You'll find everything is in order.
- Practice job. Looks good.

03:41.643 --> 03:45.273
That's our first move when we get back.
Look it over. I'll brief you on the way.

03:45.348 --> 03:49.479
This is what I was trying to do.

03:49.554 --> 03:51.545
The practice job, a heist.

03:51.624 --> 03:53.820
You and I both respond to goals.

03:53.894 --> 03:56.021
- It all leads to Mr. Henry.
- The guy from the letters.

03:56.097 --> 03:58.498
Exactly. This is rough.

03:58.567 --> 04:01.230
You and I respond to structure...

04:01.304 --> 04:04.103
and that's what's important.

04:04.176 --> 04:06.167
"The next 50."

04:08.449 --> 04:12.045
So, did you enjoy your first
visit to the nuthouse?

04:12.120 --> 04:15.113
Come on. Be sensitive to the fact
that other people...

04:15.192 --> 04:18.526
are not comfortable talking
about emotional disturbances.

04:20.031 --> 04:22.968
You know I am. I'm fine with that.
But other people...

04:23.036 --> 04:25.403
Put it behind you.
You're out. You're better.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.444
- You're right.
- And so it begins.

04:28.511 --> 04:32.073
Now, we should also get on a fitness
regime... sit-ups, hitting the bags...

04:32.150 --> 04:34.676
I was running ten miles a day
when I was in the desert.

04:34.754 --> 04:38.816
Were you really?
That's good cardiovascular.

04:38.893 --> 04:41.727
When did you get so avid
about the fitness thing, Dignan?

04:41.797 --> 04:45.063
What? What do you mean by avid?

04:45.136 --> 04:47.901
I've never known you
to be all that athletic.

04:47.973 --> 04:50.134
You've never known me
to be all that athletic?

04:50.210 --> 04:53.112
- Does it sound weird?
- Not that you're not a good athlete.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.582
- Does it sound weird to talk about it?
- It doesn't sound weird.

04:56.652 --> 04:59.986
I'm not saying it's the top priority,
but I think it's a good goal.

05:00.057 --> 05:03.323
- I think it's a really good goal.
- Here, put these on.

05:49.896 --> 05:52.525
- Obviously, good quickness.
- Yeah, in and out pretty fast.

05:52.601 --> 05:54.900
- Real fast, and good intensity.
- High intensity.

05:54.971 --> 05:57.202
Great, 'cause
I was like really fast.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.108
The preparation was good.
I think that's your specialty.

06:00.178 --> 06:03.945
If I said that, it would sound
like bragging. Okay, criticisms.

06:04.017 --> 06:07.044
- Criticisms.
- I've only one: not very thorough.

06:07.121 --> 06:09.818
- Left a lot of valuables.
- I don't think that was a mistake.

06:09.893 --> 06:13.386
That was one of the limitations
of this job.

06:13.464 --> 06:15.729
By the way, great job in there.

06:15.801 --> 06:18.669
- It was nice working with you, 'cause...
- Thank you.

06:20.709 --> 06:22.700
Next order of business: Mr. Henry.

06:22.778 --> 06:26.408
You're probably wondering when
I'm going to introduce you to Mr. Henry.

06:26.483 --> 06:29.976
In answer to that question, very soon.
In fact, judging from how well that...

06:30.055 --> 06:32.046
Here you go.
You gotta do that.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.424
Judging from how well
that job went today...

06:34.495 --> 06:36.292
including the coins and earrings...

06:36.365 --> 06:38.356
was, to say the least...

06:40.704 --> 06:43.902
You took the earrings, Dignan?
You took 'em?

06:46.914 --> 06:51.045
Well, it's my fault. Ultimately,
Anthony, when are you gonna learn?

06:51.120 --> 06:54.682
Man, you got another ball!
Should I play your game?

06:54.758 --> 06:57.751
I know you remember the list,
'cause you signed it.

06:57.829 --> 07:00.594
"The things Dignan's
not supposed to touch."

07:00.667 --> 07:03.899
I can't be sorting through all that shit
in the middle of a burglary.

07:03.972 --> 07:07.932
Hey, I don't care, okay? I bought
the earrings for my mother's birthday.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.103
I went down,
I picked 'em out myself.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.412
Hey, one thing is, every valuable item
in the house was on that list.

07:13.485 --> 07:16.046
Maybe we should've robbed your house.
Did you ever think of that?

07:16.122 --> 07:18.614
I bet that never crossed your mind.

07:19.695 --> 07:23.097
What? What? Come on, Dignan!

07:23.166 --> 07:25.100
You know there's nothing
to steal from my mom and Craig.

07:39.824 --> 07:41.553
Hey, Grace!

07:46.967 --> 07:49.026
You're supposed to be in Arizona.

07:49.104 --> 07:51.300
What, you don't say hi anymore?
Come on.

07:51.374 --> 07:53.605
Is this the...
Are you the pilot?

07:53.678 --> 07:56.443
No, I'm Anthony.
I'm Grace's brother.

07:56.515 --> 07:59.246
Will you excuse us
for a minute, Bernice?

07:59.319 --> 08:01.652
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

08:04.994 --> 08:06.928
You told her...

08:06.997 --> 08:09.990
You told your friend Bernice
I'm some kind of jet pilot?

08:10.068 --> 08:13.596
What was I supposed to say,
they stuck you in an insane asylum?

08:13.673 --> 08:18.008
It wasn't an insane asylum, Grace.
I explained it was for exhaustion.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.877
Exhaustion?

08:19.949 --> 08:21.644
Yes, exhaustion.

08:21.718 --> 08:25.849
You haven't worked a day in your life.
How could you be exhausted?

08:25.924 --> 08:28.051
Okay, sit down. Okay?

08:28.127 --> 08:32.063
I didn't come up here today
to argue with you, okay?

08:34.035 --> 08:37.972
- I got some friends waiting for me...
- Who?

08:39.110 --> 08:41.236
- Some associates.
- Dignan?

08:42.482 --> 08:45.350
Yeah, Dignan, but also...

08:46.254 --> 08:49.088
What's wrong with Dignan, Grace?
I thought you liked Dignan.

08:49.158 --> 08:52.060
- I do like Dignan.
- Then why did you sigh?

08:52.129 --> 08:53.653
But he's a liar.

08:53.731 --> 08:53.765
Bob Mapplethorpe,
potential getaway driver, go!

08:53.765 --> 08:56.428
Bob Mapplethorpe,
potential getaway driver, go!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.898
- Go.
- There's an air of mystery about me.

08:59.974 --> 09:03.240
Don't complicate it. Your strength is
you have a car you can provide.

09:03.313 --> 09:06.613
Sell yourself. Start over.
You ready? Go.

09:06.684 --> 09:09.449
Okay. All right.
I'm a risk taker.

09:09.521 --> 09:13.219
I'm growin' an entire crop of marijuana
plants in my parents' back yard.

09:13.293 --> 09:16.786
Wait a second. You're growing an entire
crop of marijuana in your back yard?

09:16.866 --> 09:20.098
Dignan, look. I'm just not that good
at this selling yourself stuff, okay?

09:20.170 --> 09:22.469
So I'm just
gonna tell you the truth.

09:22.540 --> 09:25.203
I really want to be
a part of this team...

09:25.278 --> 09:28.214
and I'm the only one
with a car.

09:29.451 --> 09:31.112
That's good.

09:32.288 --> 09:34.484
'Cause that hits me right here.

09:34.558 --> 09:38.222
Okay, can you do me a favor
and take...

09:38.297 --> 09:42.702
I want you to take these earrings
and put them in Mom's mahogany box.

09:42.770 --> 09:46.798
- Put them in your backpack.
- What are you doing with these?

09:46.876 --> 09:49.243
Could you just put them
in the box, please, Grace?

09:49.313 --> 09:54.014
You've really gotten into the bad habit
of asking a huge amount of questions.

09:56.423 --> 09:57.856
God.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.023
I gotta go, okay, pal?

10:01.096 --> 10:03.395
What's gonna happen to you, Anthony?

10:03.466 --> 10:07.369
Geez, Grace, what the hell
kind of question is that to ask me?

10:07.439 --> 10:09.373
When are you coming home?

10:13.315 --> 10:17.343
Grace, I can't come home.
I'm an adult.

10:20.258 --> 10:24.959
Why you looking at me
like that? Huh?

10:25.031 --> 10:28.126
When I was little, I wanted to know
what caused thunder...

10:28.203 --> 10:31.537
How'd it go with Grace?
How'd it go?

10:31.608 --> 10:33.633
- Can we leave, please, Bob?
- Sure.

10:35.447 --> 10:38.645
Little kids are really cute.
She is a cute little kid.

10:38.719 --> 10:43.249
What happened? I just have no idea.
I mean, how did Grace get so cynical?

10:43.325 --> 10:47.092
I can't answer that now. My only concern
is getting you back in the car.

10:47.163 --> 10:50.327
- She's come to this conclusion...
- Get back in the car where you can...

10:50.402 --> 10:55.341
- She thinks I'm a failure.
- What? She said you were a failure?

10:55.409 --> 10:57.640
What has she ever accomplished
with her life?

10:57.712 --> 11:00.181
- What do I do?
- You don't have to do anything.

11:00.249 --> 11:03.117
I'm not saying that
she has to look up to me at all.

11:03.187 --> 11:06.589
- Don't worry about it.
- Maybe she should. Why not?

11:06.659 --> 11:10.596
- She told her friend I was a pilot.
- Stop for a second and look at this.

11:10.665 --> 11:13.499
- Oh, no.
- Fact: I learned more...

11:13.569 --> 11:15.662
in the two months
I spent with Mr. Henry...

11:15.739 --> 11:18.368
than I learned in 15 years
of academic study.

11:18.443 --> 11:21.379
Fact: I can guarantee you,
after Mr. Henry sees us pull this job...

11:21.447 --> 11:24.144
he's gonna take a personal interest
in our future.

11:24.218 --> 11:26.379
Fact: Mr. Henry
drives a Jaguar.

11:26.455 --> 11:29.084
Fact: The picture's
not doing it for me right now.

11:29.159 --> 11:32.357
Well, does the fact that
I'm trying to do it do it for you?

11:32.430 --> 11:34.455
I hate to interrupt
your conversation, guys...

11:34.533 --> 11:37.264
but I think I know
what you've been going through...

11:37.338 --> 11:39.773
'cause I've been through
some pretty heavy shit myself.

11:39.841 --> 11:42.675
If you're feeling alone,
like nobody in the world cares...

11:42.745 --> 11:46.238
and nobody in the fucking world
gives a shit, then I'm here.

11:46.317 --> 11:48.478
- That was a stop sign.
- I'm ready to listen, man.

11:48.554 --> 11:50.488
If you want,
I'll even open up first.

11:50.557 --> 11:54.858
My brother... That's a shit situation.
He beats the crap out of me always.

12:01.673 --> 12:04.802
I don't suppose either of you know
why Bob's car is parked out front.

12:04.877 --> 12:07.438
Yeah, he's here.

12:07.514 --> 12:09.573
- He's ins...
- He's here at the house.

12:09.650 --> 12:11.584
Let me see if Bob's
keeping the pool clean.

12:11.653 --> 12:13.780
- That's Future Man.
- Yeah, I know.

12:17.429 --> 12:19.363
What the fuck is this?

12:20.199 --> 12:24.661
Vamanos, Clay. Bob, you were told to
thoroughly clean the pool this morning.

12:24.739 --> 12:26.673
- It's a leaf.
- It was one leaf!

12:28.245 --> 12:30.179
Your name's Anthony, isn't it?

12:30.248 --> 12:32.979
Yeah, his name's Anthony.
My name's Dignan.

12:33.051 --> 12:36.021
I'm Stacy Sinclair,
Elizabeth's sorority sister.

12:36.090 --> 12:39.185
I didn't know
she had a sister.

12:39.261 --> 12:42.197
Oh, my God.
You have the best sense of humor.

12:42.266 --> 12:45.532
She is going to be so jealous
I saw you here.

12:45.603 --> 12:48.835
So, you go to school
in Arizona, right?

12:48.909 --> 12:52.778
- No, I was in the hospital.
- Oh, what for?

12:55.718 --> 12:57.983
I went nuts.

12:58.055 --> 13:01.389
- He's kidding. He didn't go nuts.
- You poor thing. How'd it happen?

13:01.460 --> 13:05.022
- Do you really wanna know?
- Yes, I really do.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.568
One morning
over at Elizabeth's beach house...

13:11.641 --> 13:16.307
she asked me if I'd rather
go water skiing or lay out.

13:16.381 --> 13:20.945
And I realized that not only did I
not want to answer that question...

13:21.021 --> 13:24.924
but I never wanted to answer
another water-sports question...

13:24.994 --> 13:28.487
or see any of these people again
for the rest of my life.

13:30.035 --> 13:33.494
Three days later I was on my way
out to the desert, and that was that.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.569
Bullying son of a bitch!

13:37.646 --> 13:40.980
You're calling me a bully?
Here's a bully for ya!

13:43.722 --> 13:46.191
Hold on, Bob! You're only
gonna make this take longer!

13:46.259 --> 13:48.318
You're really complicated,
aren't you?

13:48.395 --> 13:51.092
- My ear!
- I try not to be.

14:30.656 --> 14:33.592
Okay, escape route is crucial...

14:33.661 --> 14:37.098
in case somebody is tailing us
or even chasing us, as the case may be.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.431
We can't be sure
how it is gonna happen.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.699
Do you think
we're gonna be chased?

14:41.773 --> 14:44.766
That's a good question.
No, I don't think we're gonna be chased.

14:44.844 --> 14:47.973
I'm just being hypocritical here.
However, I will say...

14:48.048 --> 14:52.110
Bob, please don't interrupt me, man,
'cause I'm trying to stay focused.

14:52.188 --> 14:56.559
You're responsible for the external
situation, streets and the getaway.

14:56.628 --> 15:00.531
Excuse me. Are the explosives
really necessary here?

15:00.600 --> 15:03.934
I think it would be a lot more simple if
I just walked up to the door alone.

15:04.006 --> 15:06.703
- I think that would be...
- Why are you undermining me?

15:06.776 --> 15:10.144
How many bullets does this thing take?
Look, I'm paying attention.

15:10.215 --> 15:13.652
Goddamn it! You're not paying attention
if you're messing around with the gun!

15:13.719 --> 15:16.518
Now, quit... Anthony,
keep the gun on the table.

15:16.591 --> 15:18.024
Look, Dignan, relax.

15:18.092 --> 15:20.721
I can't focus
unless the gun is on the table.

15:20.797 --> 15:22.856
- I paid for it.
- Shut up, man!

15:22.933 --> 15:25.129
I'm warning you now.
Be quiet, please.

15:25.203 --> 15:28.662
- It's true. I paid for the gun.
- Say it one more time.

15:28.741 --> 15:31.404
Say it again.
Repeat what you just said.

15:33.716 --> 15:35.513
I paid for the gun.

15:42.328 --> 15:44.889
He's out. You're out too.

15:44.965 --> 15:46.933
- And I don't think I'm in, either.
- Calm down.

15:47.002 --> 15:50.166
No gang!
You two just don't give a shit.

15:50.239 --> 15:53.573
When it comes right down to it,
you don't care.

15:53.645 --> 15:56.513
How does an asshole like Bob
get such a great kitchen?

16:12.472 --> 16:16.000
I apologize.
That was poor leadership.

16:16.077 --> 16:19.275
I'm under a lot of pressure
right now, and...

16:20.617 --> 16:23.314
I don't feel like the team
is gelling the way...

16:23.387 --> 16:26.585
if I can even use that word, 'cause
I don't even know if we are a team.

16:26.659 --> 16:29.561
Hey, we are a team.

16:33.002 --> 16:35.733
Yeah, a team.

16:40.679 --> 16:43.979
There. You see, the star is me.
Right there. I'll be in there.

16:44.051 --> 16:47.579
The X is Anthony. Bob, you're
the zero out here in the car.

16:56.603 --> 16:59.072
What are you putting that tape
on your nose for?

16:59.140 --> 17:00.573
Exactly.

17:05.049 --> 17:06.983
Let's get lucky.

17:10.924 --> 17:13.791
Yo, you open the door.

17:13.862 --> 17:17.526
- Okay, wait right here.
- Come on, let's go.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.866
Don't panic.
Get him to open the door.

17:20.939 --> 17:24.397
- Don't panic.
- I left my sweater inside.

17:24.477 --> 17:28.005
I know. Do you have
a lost and found?

17:28.082 --> 17:30.779
- Here he comes.
- A lost and found?

17:34.525 --> 17:38.326
- I'm sorry. We're closed, sir.
- I left my sweater in...

17:38.397 --> 17:40.696
What's that on your nose?

17:40.767 --> 17:44.397
I cut it. I got a cut across the bridge.
Do you have a lost and found?

17:44.473 --> 17:47.875
- Can you come back tomorrow?
- I can't. I gotta get it tonight.

17:47.944 --> 17:51.745
Well, let me check with my manager.
Hold on one second. Just stand inside.

17:52.819 --> 17:55.345
Hey, excuse me, sir.
We're closed.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.483
- Oh. What about that guy?
- I left my sweater in here.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.826
- He forgot his sweater.
- Oh, yeah? I left some money in there.

18:01.899 --> 18:04.630
- Money? Where?
- In the cash register. Step back.

18:04.702 --> 18:06.761
Stockers!
Where are the other stockers?

18:06.839 --> 18:09.707
Who? Robbie? He might be in Literature.
That's his section.

18:09.776 --> 18:12.940
Hey, is that the manager?
Who is that? Come here!

18:13.015 --> 18:15.348
- I'm gonna go down this aisle.
- What's going on here?

18:15.418 --> 18:17.751
- I'm sending you both back there.
- All right!

18:17.821 --> 18:19.755
Come on, move!

18:26.601 --> 18:28.934
Okay, sit down!
Get up against the wall!

18:29.004 --> 18:32.031
What's in here? Where's the money?
Talk, stretch!

18:32.109 --> 18:33.542
It's in the drawer.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.671
Okay, there it is.
Come on, open up that drawer.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.150
- No, it's not.
- The other one!

18:40.422 --> 18:42.356
There's the money. Okay.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.088
Put it in one of those bags.
Get one of those bags.

18:46.029 --> 18:48.624
Let's move! Come on!
A bigger one, you idiot!

18:48.700 --> 18:51.329
Don't call me an idiot,
you punk.

18:54.942 --> 18:59.438
Do you have bigger bags
for atlases or dictionaries, sir?

19:04.490 --> 19:06.617
- Robbie?
- Uh-huh.

19:06.693 --> 19:09.595
Aren't you supposed to be in literature?

19:09.664 --> 19:12.634
- It's all full up.
- They need you in the office right now.

19:12.701 --> 19:15.569
Put the money in the little bags.
We'll just use a lot of them.

19:15.639 --> 19:19.804
Quickly.
Just do your best.

19:19.879 --> 19:22.178
Why do you wear
that tape on your nose?

19:23.685 --> 19:25.676
Little bags, man.

19:27.056 --> 19:30.549
Okay, everybody...
I want everybody to just sit tight.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.598
Okay. Thank you so much.

19:36.503 --> 19:39.564
Success! Full success!
We're heading back to Bob's.

19:39.641 --> 19:44.376
We're gonna hit the road
and go on the lam! Go!

19:47.318 --> 19:50.186
Okay now, before we divide the loot,
let me say one thing.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.921
Bob gets the "Spirit Award"
on this caper.

19:53.995 --> 19:56.396
And although his share
won't be as equal as ours...

19:56.466 --> 19:58.799
- What? What are you...
- Come here, Bob.

19:58.869 --> 20:02.135
Did you see the look he gave me?
Don't double-cross this guy.

20:02.207 --> 20:06.372
Great work, both of you.
Clink, clink.

20:06.447 --> 20:08.882
So, Dignan, what's next?

20:08.950 --> 20:11.545
Do we meet the crew
after we go on the lam or what?

20:11.621 --> 20:14.489
Everybody wants to know what's next.
May I enjoy this moment?

20:14.559 --> 20:16.083
What crew?

20:16.929 --> 20:19.194
Now is not a good time
to bring up the crew.

20:19.265 --> 20:21.096
Goddamn it.

20:21.168 --> 20:24.161
Ya son of a bitch!
You're gonna cut me out!

20:24.239 --> 20:28.701
Wait a second, Bob. Nobody's
cutting anybody out of anything.

20:28.780 --> 20:31.249
- Let me show you this.
- Whoa.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.946
Bob should see this.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.854
Bob, I got something.

20:36.924 --> 20:40.053
- What's this supposed to be?
- That's the crew.

20:40.130 --> 20:42.291
That's Mr. Henry.
He's a... I know.

20:43.134 --> 20:46.161
Anthony, that's the Lawn Wranglers...

20:46.239 --> 20:49.676
the landscape company
that Dignan here used to work for.

20:49.743 --> 20:51.677
What do you mean, landscaping?

20:51.746 --> 20:57.311
I mean push the mower,
trim the hedge... landscaping.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.689
- Landscaping?
- Landscaping.

21:07.736 --> 21:11.833
Yes, they're landscapers, okay?
Yes, they're landscapers.

21:11.909 --> 21:14.242
But did it ever occur to you
that a landscaping crew...

21:14.313 --> 21:16.544
is a perfect front
for an operation?

21:16.616 --> 21:19.211
Look at this.
You've seen this picture.

21:19.287 --> 21:22.314
That is Mr. Henry, and aside
from owning the Lawn Wranglers...

21:22.391 --> 21:24.325
he is a very talented thief.

21:24.394 --> 21:27.626
Then why aren't you over there
right now?

21:27.699 --> 21:29.964
Because we're fugitives.

21:32.606 --> 21:34.733
And also because he fired me.

21:39.416 --> 21:42.011
Best job I ever had...

21:42.086 --> 21:45.215
working my way up, meeting people...

21:45.291 --> 21:47.886
listening to stories.

21:47.962 --> 21:51.524
One day he walks over and says,
"Dignan, you're out," just like that.

21:53.503 --> 21:55.437
By the way, man, he was right.

21:55.506 --> 21:59.375
Just because it's a front doesn't mean
somebody doesn't have to do landscaping.

22:02.183 --> 22:04.174
But those days are over now.

22:04.253 --> 22:06.654
Just a matter of time
before I pick up the phone and say...

22:06.723 --> 22:10.091
"Mr. H., we are coming home."

22:10.160 --> 22:14.097
So don't worry about your future, man,
because I am thinking.

22:21.978 --> 22:24.311
If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention...

22:24.382 --> 22:26.373
to Bob about me getting fired.

22:26.451 --> 22:28.043
I won't.

22:39.570 --> 22:42.005
On the run from Johnny Law.

22:42.074 --> 22:44.065
It ain't no trip to Cleveland.

23:13.019 --> 23:14.509
I love it!

23:15.589 --> 23:17.147
And another one for me!

23:19.095 --> 23:20.653
Bobby, one for you!

23:20.731 --> 23:22.858
Anthony, fire away!

23:22.934 --> 23:26.098
Somebody hand me one! I'm gonna
throw it out the window! Cherry bomb!

23:27.607 --> 23:29.803
Did you hear that?

23:29.877 --> 23:33.177
Dignan, I don't expect you
to be as depressed as I am...

23:33.249 --> 23:35.548
but I don't think...
Watch the road, Bob.

23:35.619 --> 23:39.386
But I don't think that
your happiness is quite appropriate.

23:39.457 --> 23:43.155
I mean, your 75-year plan
does not seem to be working, you know?

23:43.230 --> 23:47.327
The only thing I've learned so far
is that crime does not pay.

23:48.805 --> 23:51.775
Gee, man, that's not the greatest
attitude in the world to have.

23:51.842 --> 23:54.175
I don't think we get anywhere
by complaining, guys.

23:54.246 --> 23:56.647
Okay. You're right.

23:56.716 --> 23:58.650
There we go.

23:58.719 --> 24:01.746
Perfect little place to lie low.

24:01.824 --> 24:05.158
We'll get in touch with Mr. Henry.
I'll get the best room in the house.

24:05.228 --> 24:06.661
Crime does pay.

25:29.919 --> 25:34.118
I can't get my hair cut.
That's just no possible, all right?

25:34.191 --> 25:37.753
You're gonna have to dye it red, man,
'cause we need to hide our identities.

25:37.830 --> 25:41.198
No, I'm sorry.
I can't do that either.

25:41.269 --> 25:45.731
Even if it's the difference between
some trooper throwing us in jail or not?

25:45.809 --> 25:47.242
I guess so.

25:47.311 --> 25:50.145
Then you, my dear friend,
are a damn fool.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.674
Let's go, Bob.
Come on. Bob, let's go!

25:53.753 --> 25:55.687
- See you.
- See you later, Bob.

25:55.756 --> 25:57.223
A damn fool!

26:06.205 --> 26:09.369
- Excuse me.
- No, it's okay. Come on in.

26:11.714 --> 26:13.648
Oh, excuse me.

26:18.290 --> 26:21.226
Gee, it's great how you're able
to bring a room to life like this...

26:21.294 --> 26:23.228
with just a little touch.

26:30.774 --> 26:35.213
Geez, it's...
It's nice out today, isn't it?

26:35.280 --> 26:38.045
Boy, you get a nice breeze
with that door open like this.

26:38.119 --> 26:40.053
It was kind of stuffy in here.

26:40.122 --> 26:42.990
Do you do all of these rooms
yourself? All of these...

26:44.628 --> 26:47.564
I'm Anthony. Anthony.

26:52.239 --> 26:53.900
What's your name?

26:53.975 --> 26:57.468
- Inez.
- Inez. That's... Wow.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.716
Oh. Sorry.

27:09.297 --> 27:12.131
Sorry this is such a mess here.

27:12.201 --> 27:14.693
Here, let me give you
a hand with this.

27:27.323 --> 27:29.484
I think I might've seen you
earlier when I was swimming.

27:29.560 --> 27:33.053
Did you happen to see me there?
By the pool?

27:34.434 --> 27:36.995
Yeah, that was me.

27:37.071 --> 27:38.504
Yep.

27:41.611 --> 27:44.046
You speak English?

27:44.115 --> 27:45.548
Spanish?

27:47.220 --> 27:51.886
You have really good posture, you know?
You stand up very straight.

27:53.261 --> 27:55.628
You know, people think
that 'cause they're in a hotel...

27:55.699 --> 27:58.294
that they can really
just kind of act like slobs.

27:58.369 --> 28:01.134
It's bad manners,
if you ask me.

28:01.206 --> 28:03.835
But then, if I were guilty
of it, yeah.

28:03.910 --> 28:06.243
Which part of Mexico are you from?

28:06.313 --> 28:08.247
- Paraguay.
- Paraguay.

28:08.316 --> 28:10.751
Boy, okay.
That's kind of over...

28:10.820 --> 28:12.754
- Excuse me.
- Under Guatemala, I think.

28:12.823 --> 28:14.757
Sorry, Inez.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.794
These towels are still warm.

28:19.867 --> 28:22.860
I guess that's
from the dryer. See?

28:25.341 --> 28:26.706
Housekeeping.

28:27.845 --> 28:30.576
- Sorry.
- No. We're just checking out.

28:46.739 --> 28:49.903
- 0 and 2.
- Son of a bitch!

28:51.246 --> 28:54.341
That's a good haircut there.
Parted on the side.

28:54.418 --> 28:56.443
- Thank you.
- That's what my friend needs to get.

28:56.521 --> 28:58.455
Bob, get one like this.

28:58.523 --> 29:01.220
- They're one out away from a win.
- Here, you go first.

29:01.294 --> 29:03.353
May I speak to you
for a moment, please?

29:03.431 --> 29:05.900
It's about my marijuana crop.
I don't want everyone to hear this.

29:05.968 --> 29:08.961
- I don't want to lose my place in line.
- My brother is in jail.

29:09.038 --> 29:13.636
What? Wait a second.
Your brother's... Why?

29:13.712 --> 29:16.511
- The weed.
- What weed?

29:16.583 --> 29:19.451
The weed from my back...
from my back yard.

29:25.029 --> 29:29.194
They got him by the balls.
What's the official charge?

29:29.269 --> 29:31.328
They say he's a drug dealer.

29:32.406 --> 29:35.808
That's so unfair.
They say he's a drug dealer?

29:35.878 --> 29:38.177
You and I both know
he's not a drug dealer.

29:38.248 --> 29:40.375
Right?

29:40.451 --> 29:42.716
- He's not a drug dealer.
- I know, Dignan. I know.

29:42.788 --> 29:47.352
Well? Well, Bob, what about
hiding our identities?

29:48.931 --> 29:52.424
I'm sorry, guys. We're gonna
have to take a rain check.

29:57.310 --> 30:01.338
God, this is great,
sitting here in the laundry room...

30:01.415 --> 30:06.081
you working on your vocabulary
and we're sharing these tamales.

30:08.893 --> 30:11.624
It's... It's just, how unexpected.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.631
What is that, Inez?

30:16.705 --> 30:19.402
Does that open?

30:25.283 --> 30:27.775
Wow, you were just a little girl
when this was taken.

30:27.854 --> 30:30.483
A little girl in Paraguay.

30:33.829 --> 30:36.856
May I keep this?
May I have it?

30:39.371 --> 30:41.567
She's my sister.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.471
Really?

30:45.146 --> 30:47.307
She looks just like you.

30:49.953 --> 30:52.012
Can I keep it anyway?

31:08.613 --> 31:12.015
- I'm sorry. We're in the wrong room.
- No, man, this is...

31:12.085 --> 31:14.520
No. Okay, I guess
there's been a mistake made.

31:14.588 --> 31:19.220
212? Do you speak English?
We have a friend.

31:25.504 --> 31:26.937
What the...

31:29.143 --> 31:31.339
Thought you guys
went to get your hair cut.

31:31.413 --> 31:33.313
No, we didn't.

31:34.050 --> 31:36.349
Well, gang,
this is my friend Dig...

31:36.420 --> 31:40.050
My name's Jerry, and this is Cornelius.
Anthony, what's going on?

31:40.126 --> 31:43.290
I'm having a party in here.
I made some banana daiquiris.

31:43.363 --> 31:45.889
- Do you want one?
- Yeah, I guess I'll have one.

31:45.968 --> 31:48.699
Come on in here, man.

31:48.772 --> 31:52.038
This is Inez,
and that's Rocky right there.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.375
Come on, Bob. Shut the door.
Get in here, man.

31:54.447 --> 31:57.884
Anybody else want anything?
Soda for Rocky.

31:57.952 --> 32:01.116
- Come on, Bob, let me get you one.
- Anthony, I've got to talk to you!

32:01.190 --> 32:03.591
Look, I'm sorry.
This seems like a nice soiree...

32:03.660 --> 32:05.355
but I've got a family situation.

32:05.430 --> 32:07.523
I don't care what you think.

32:10.270 --> 32:15.039
Dignan does not want to deal with it.
Please come outside for a minute!

32:15.110 --> 32:18.478
Bob, I'm just saying we gotta
analyze the situation, okay?

32:18.549 --> 32:21.018
First of all,
how long are they gonna hold him?

32:21.086 --> 32:25.183
I don't know. All I know is that Phil
says they got him, that he's in jail.

32:25.259 --> 32:29.424
Okay, I've made a suggestion
that he needs to hire an attorney.

32:29.498 --> 32:31.489
You are pushing your luck, man.

32:31.568 --> 32:35.061
- Hey, Dignan, he does have a point.
- I'm the leader.

32:35.139 --> 32:38.109
- You think I should abandon my brother?
- Yeah.

32:38.178 --> 32:41.979
I'm saying let's keep it...
Let's keep it very simple, okay?

32:42.050 --> 32:46.853
We'll make some calls,
figure out what's going on...

32:46.924 --> 32:50.122
and if he's not out in 48 hours,
then we'll go back, okay?

32:52.765 --> 32:55.530
- What?
- Is that okay?

32:57.973 --> 33:01.239
And I wasn't trying to antagonize you
by saying that stuff.

33:01.311 --> 33:03.302
It's just you were gonna
fly off half-cocked.

33:03.380 --> 33:07.283
- Don't tell me what I was gonna do.
- It's a team decision.

33:22.041 --> 33:25.773
What? What did you...
What does that mean?

33:32.590 --> 33:34.923
l... I don't know
what to say.

33:34.994 --> 33:37.862
- What I'm talking?
- No.

33:45.142 --> 33:47.269
Your skin feels like silk.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.614
Like silk?

33:53.086 --> 33:56.989
- What silk?
- Your skin, it feels so soft and silky.

33:57.059 --> 34:00.689
- It's soft.
- Silk?

34:00.765 --> 34:03.530
Sandpaper. Silk.

34:05.004 --> 34:08.873
- Silk. A new word.
- It's very soft.

34:08.943 --> 34:11.070
I don't know it in Spanish.

34:14.418 --> 34:16.683
Can I kiss you?

34:31.009 --> 34:33.501
Marco! Marco!

34:36.248 --> 34:39.844
No lifeguard on duty.
Swim at your own risk.

34:42.125 --> 34:46.460
Okay, we'll... We'll be
very careful, Jerry. Thank you.

34:46.531 --> 34:49.467
You guys mind if I take a dip?
Hey, I'm kidding.

34:49.534 --> 34:51.800
I'm not that insensitive.

34:51.871 --> 34:55.934
Besides, I didn't bring my trunks,
anyway. How's the water down there?

34:56.011 --> 34:59.914
I'm gonna give you something, okay?
I want you to hold onto this.

35:01.587 --> 35:05.046
Well, thank you for listening
to our old war stories.

35:05.125 --> 35:07.788
I hope they didn't bore you
too terribly.

35:12.803 --> 35:16.763
- Well, anyway, good evening.
- Bye, Jerry.

35:16.842 --> 35:19.277
Anyways, the watch, okay?

35:19.346 --> 35:21.041
It has an alarm on it...

35:21.115 --> 35:24.711
and will go off and make a sound
when we're supposed to meet.

35:24.788 --> 35:28.520
You do that by this little button.
You can just press that. See?

35:31.564 --> 35:33.498
It's pretty simple.

35:39.408 --> 35:42.242
- I have to go.
- I'm very glad I met you, Inez.

35:42.313 --> 35:44.509
Me too. I have to go.

36:00.473 --> 36:02.498
Son of a bitch!

36:06.615 --> 36:09.551
Bob's gone!
He stole his car!

36:09.619 --> 36:12.316
That little coward!
That son of a bitch!

36:13.625 --> 36:15.958
Son of a bitch, man.

36:19.434 --> 36:22.131
He flew the coop
while we were sleepin'.

36:23.573 --> 36:26.372
- He has no character, man.
- Maybe he went up to the store.

36:26.444 --> 36:29.175
No, man, he took his stuff.
He's long gone.

36:29.248 --> 36:32.480
Hi, housekeeping?
Could I speak to Inez, please?

36:32.553 --> 36:35.580
I thought she gets in at 9:00.

36:35.657 --> 36:38.388
Oh, it... Okay. See,
I don't have my watch on.

36:38.461 --> 36:40.292
She has it.

36:40.364 --> 36:43.129
Tell me something.
What's it like working with her?

36:43.202 --> 36:46.604
I bet she's really great at...
Okay. Bye.

36:47.675 --> 36:51.009
We'll get him. Weâll get him, man.
Don't worry about that.

36:51.079 --> 36:54.846
And we'll blow up his car
or do something, I guarantee you that.

36:54.919 --> 36:58.549
What makes me furious is thinking
about the look on Bob's fat face...

36:58.624 --> 37:02.356
when he drives away today thinking
that he's pulled one over on us.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.899
- I'll tell you another thing...
- Dignan, please.

37:04.967 --> 37:09.234
If our paths cross again, you're gonna
see a side of me you haven't seen yet...

37:09.307 --> 37:12.835
a sick, sadistic side...
because I'm furious at Bob.

37:12.911 --> 37:16.313
- Come on, Dignan!
- Come on what?

37:16.383 --> 37:20.218
Bob didn't steal the car.
You know, he told me he was leaving.

37:20.289 --> 37:23.282
He went back to help his brother.

37:28.233 --> 37:31.362
Dignan, look. I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about Bob leaving.

37:31.439 --> 37:34.637
You had just as much right
to know as I did. I'm sorry.

37:34.710 --> 37:37.578
Thank you.
That's all I needed.

37:37.648 --> 37:40.743
I mean, who's to say that you need Bob
to have an adventure?

37:40.819 --> 37:43.584
Where's that rule written?
There's nothing that says that.

37:43.657 --> 37:45.591
What are you working on?

37:45.659 --> 37:48.128
Just a sketch. It's...

37:49.598 --> 37:51.794
It's, you know,
just a little horse...

37:53.204 --> 37:57.198
with little sparks comin' off,
kind of like stardust.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.437
Nothin'.

38:01.182 --> 38:02.444
Sorry. It's just...

38:02.517 --> 38:05.681
Don't apologize to me.
Don't do that to me.

38:05.756 --> 38:09.591
Don't treat me like the jealous friend,
because that's not what this is about.

38:09.661 --> 38:12.631
I'm as excited for you
as anybody is.

38:12.699 --> 38:15.396
Really? Then I gotta go.

38:15.469 --> 38:17.494
I'll see you later, Dignan.
See you back at the room.

39:40.995 --> 39:43.726
It's so weird,
the way this happened.

39:43.799 --> 39:46.200
It's so good to be with you.

40:10.637 --> 40:13.630
Why don't you come over to this bar
we're going to, Dignan?

40:13.709 --> 40:16.611
- Where?
- It's in the town.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.648
No, I don't want to go.

40:20.953 --> 40:23.548
Why don't you just come with us?

40:30.132 --> 40:33.569
Why don't you just
come over there with us?

40:33.638 --> 40:35.230
All right.

40:43.652 --> 40:45.085
Sparkler.

40:45.154 --> 40:47.315
I certainly can't feel
any worse than I do.

40:47.391 --> 40:49.325
Don't worry.
All he needs is one drink.

40:52.331 --> 40:54.265
Hello, my friend.

40:57.773 --> 41:02.212
- You're in the army, yes?
- No. I just have short hair.

41:03.382 --> 41:06.147
Amigo, let's play pool!

41:27.750 --> 41:30.743
Boy, that guy was
a real chatterbox, wasn't he?

41:30.821 --> 41:34.553
I didn't think he was ever gonna
stop with the story. Jesus!

41:34.627 --> 41:37.256
That's what I call
a language barrier.

41:37.331 --> 41:40.893
- I need to take it easy.
- Amigo, you just cheated!

41:40.970 --> 41:43.269
Okay! I'm calling my gang!

41:43.340 --> 41:47.904
It's just a little frustrating
when you guys talk so easily.

41:47.980 --> 41:52.578
God, you know, I can't believe the guy
just decided to jump you like that.

41:54.923 --> 41:57.893
- Can you pass me those french fries?
- Yeah.

41:59.162 --> 42:03.429
Dignan, you know I was right out
in front of the place with Inez.

42:03.502 --> 42:06.097
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not relive it.

42:07.308 --> 42:09.834
Don't really feel
much like talking about it.

42:11.514 --> 42:14.973
In fact, the only thing I feel like
is getting the fuck out of this town.

42:15.053 --> 42:18.990
Yeah. We need a car, I think.

42:19.058 --> 42:21.117
I have an idea for that.

42:21.194 --> 42:24.687
Inez has a master key
to all the rooms, doesn't she?

42:25.935 --> 42:28.302
Doesn't she?

42:28.372 --> 42:30.306
I don't think we can do that.

42:30.375 --> 42:32.434
I know we can.
It's real simple.

42:32.512 --> 42:35.243
We go into another room,
take some car keys...

42:35.315 --> 42:38.308
It's not even
a possibility, okay?

42:45.330 --> 42:47.891
Then we're gonna
have to hot-wire a car...

42:47.967 --> 42:50.630
and this idea
I don't back down from.

42:50.704 --> 42:54.141
- This idea...
- Inez, let's go outside.

42:54.210 --> 42:56.144
- Jerry's not...
- How are you, Jerry?

42:58.616 --> 43:00.675
I feel great, Inez.

43:00.753 --> 43:04.315
He's under the weather
a little bit.

43:04.391 --> 43:07.589
- So, l...
- Bye.

43:07.663 --> 43:10.428
I kind of gotta take care of him
for a few minutes.

43:16.175 --> 43:19.111
I had a really great time.

43:43.715 --> 43:47.015
Inez, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but I think I've got it.

43:48.489 --> 43:52.449
I've gotta talk to you, Inez.
I got a lot I need to tell you.

43:52.529 --> 43:56.057
Thirty seconds ago, I was lost,
just in a total fog...

43:56.133 --> 43:58.898
and then it hit me
like a bolt of lightning.

43:58.970 --> 44:03.101
Perfect clarity. Don't slow me down.
I gotta get this out while it's fresh.

44:03.177 --> 44:05.772
Um, this could get
a little tough to communicate.

44:05.848 --> 44:07.782
Where's the kid?
Where's Rocky?

44:07.851 --> 44:09.614
- Hey, Rocky.
- Yeah?

44:09.686 --> 44:12.019
- Can you help me out?
- What do you need?

44:12.090 --> 44:14.423
I just need you
to translate some stuff.

44:14.494 --> 44:17.020
I can't. I'm busy.
I got too much work.

44:17.097 --> 44:19.726
It'll take two seconds.
Just give me three minutes.

44:19.801 --> 44:23.397
Come on. Please. I'll help you
finish the dishes later.

44:25.176 --> 44:28.146
Okay, this is what I want to say.
This is how I see it.

44:29.916 --> 44:34.685
Beautiful, intelligent girl
from Paraguay...

44:36.359 --> 44:40.160
by chance happens to be workin'
at a motel in the middle of nowhere.

44:40.232 --> 44:43.691
Lost and confused.
Totally lost.

44:43.769 --> 44:46.102
Incredibly unhappy person...

44:46.173 --> 44:49.507
accidentally wanders in
off the highway...

44:50.613 --> 44:54.243
and they meet
and they fall in love...

44:54.318 --> 44:56.047
and it's perfect.

44:56.121 --> 44:58.282
I mean, it is perfect.

44:59.459 --> 45:01.222
And I can only hope...

45:01.295 --> 45:06.428
that she feels a tenth
of the way that I feel.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.776
I mean, Inez, when we had sex
this afternoon, it was...

45:12.846 --> 45:15.509
It was fun, you know?

45:17.152 --> 45:18.551
So... Come on, Rocky.

45:25.130 --> 45:27.964
Okay, so to make
a long story short...

45:29.836 --> 45:33.534
when we leave here tomorrow,
I want you to come with us.

45:36.313 --> 45:37.974
And I want us, no matter what...

45:39.217 --> 45:40.548
Where are you going?

45:41.754 --> 45:44.952
- What?
- Where are you going?

45:45.025 --> 45:47.256
Where are we going?

45:49.465 --> 45:52.958
What do you want me to say?
You want me to live with you and Jerry?

45:53.037 --> 45:55.198
- I can't go.
- Why not?

45:55.274 --> 45:57.505
Why?

45:59.280 --> 46:02.273
- I just told you why not.
- That's no reason, Inez.

46:02.351 --> 46:05.219
I'm trying to explain to you
why I want you to come with us.

46:13.100 --> 46:15.831
Look. Wait, wait.

46:15.904 --> 46:18.931
We'll stay here, all right?
I don't understand it, but...

46:19.008 --> 46:22.775
I'm just gonna follow
my instincts on this one.

46:30.158 --> 46:33.219
You're like paper.
You know, you're trash.

46:35.065 --> 46:36.498
Like trash?

46:36.567 --> 46:38.866
You know, you're
like paper flying by.

46:39.939 --> 46:42.374
It doesn't sound
that bad in Spanish.

46:55.762 --> 46:57.696
Well, what, Rocky?

46:58.833 --> 47:02.065
She... She doesn't
want you to stay.

47:04.608 --> 47:06.041
She doesn't?

47:06.111 --> 47:09.013
You have to understand.
She's an organized person.

47:09.081 --> 47:13.348
- She can't just leave.
- She didn't say that, did she, Rocky?

47:13.421 --> 47:16.152
No, but I'm just telling you,
she's a serious person.

47:16.225 --> 47:18.524
Please, just do the...

47:33.317 --> 47:34.909
Excuse me.

47:37.756 --> 47:40.692
Mi amigo Anthony asked me
to give you this envelope.

47:40.761 --> 47:43.560
There you go. We certainly
enjoyed our stay here.

47:43.632 --> 47:47.262
We'd recommend this motel
to any of our friends that might...

47:48.839 --> 47:50.773
Take care of Anthony.

47:59.054 --> 48:02.786
- Is okay?
- Yeah, I feel a lot better.

48:09.236 --> 48:11.170
So long.

48:28.031 --> 48:29.498
Jerry!

48:33.471 --> 48:36.305
- Tell Anthony I love him.
- Do what?

48:37.377 --> 48:39.311
Tell Anthony I love him.

48:45.088 --> 48:47.147
All right, man. Okay.

50:03.269 --> 50:07.070
Shit, man.
What a lemon!

50:07.141 --> 50:09.838
I don't know, man.
One minute it's running like a top...

50:09.912 --> 50:13.110
and the next minute it's broken down
on the side of the road.

50:13.184 --> 50:16.848
I can't fix a car like this.
I don't have the tools to do it, man!

50:16.923 --> 50:20.485
Even if I did, I can't promise you
I'd know how to fix a car like that!

50:20.561 --> 50:22.928
You see the house over here?

50:22.997 --> 50:25.432
Let's walk over to it.
We'll use the phone.

50:25.502 --> 50:27.094
We need to go home, okay?

50:27.170 --> 50:29.867
Whoa, no.
Let's go to plan B.

50:29.942 --> 50:31.967
We'll hitchhike to the next town...
Look, we hitchhike...

50:32.045 --> 50:34.981
Look, it's over, okay?
We're broke.

50:35.049 --> 50:36.812
We're gonna go home.

50:36.885 --> 50:38.819
First of all, what is broke to you?

50:38.888 --> 50:42.450
You're so spoiled. Having only
a few hundred dollars is not broke.

50:42.527 --> 50:44.723
We're okay.
This is a setback. We hitchhike...

50:45.798 --> 50:47.732
What is this?

50:49.971 --> 50:51.666
All right. $16.

50:51.740 --> 50:54.005
So, where's the rest of the money?

50:54.077 --> 50:56.204
You gave it to Inez.

50:57.883 --> 51:00.114
No, I never gave Inez anything.

51:01.988 --> 51:04.149
In the envelope.

51:31.865 --> 51:36.861
Pointless act! You don't give
a $500 tip to the housekeeper!

51:36.940 --> 51:39.933
That's inappropriate!
That's inexcusable!

51:40.010 --> 51:43.071
That, I don't forgive!
What were you thinking?

51:45.084 --> 51:47.109
- Don't call her the housekeeper.
- That's what she is.

51:47.187 --> 51:49.679
Don't threaten me. That's what she is.
She is a housekeeper.

51:49.757 --> 51:52.056
- People are housekeepers.
- You better watch it.

51:52.128 --> 51:54.563
You don't know what you're talking about
right now.

51:54.632 --> 51:57.431
Her name's Inez.

51:57.502 --> 52:00.097
And my name's Dignan, man.
So what?

52:02.476 --> 52:04.707
She didn't love you, man.

52:07.217 --> 52:08.650
Now where are you going?

52:22.506 --> 52:24.873
Come on. Let's go.

52:24.943 --> 52:27.139
Why did you do it, man?

52:28.882 --> 52:32.114
I don't really think you know
what I was going through back there...

52:32.186 --> 52:34.917
Please don't lay that on me now, man...

52:34.990 --> 52:37.619
because I'm not interested
in hearing any of that.

52:39.664 --> 52:43.066
Did it ever occur to you that I might
enjoy a great stay...

52:43.136 --> 52:45.799
at some mental hospital
out in the middle of nowhere...

52:45.873 --> 52:49.901
going running at night, getting a tan
with a bunch of beautiful girls?

52:49.979 --> 52:52.140
Did you ever think about that?

52:52.215 --> 52:56.677
What do you think Dignan was doing
that whole time you were out there?

52:56.755 --> 53:01.217
I told you Dignan got fired...
out on his ass.

53:01.295 --> 53:03.388
But you never thought about that,
did you?

53:05.970 --> 53:09.407
In the end it's easier to think about
yourself than to think about Dignan.

53:11.210 --> 53:13.736
Dignan, come on.

53:15.750 --> 53:19.812
I thought I was supposed to be the one
that was a little crazy, you know?

53:23.395 --> 53:25.556
Dignan, come on.

54:04.789 --> 54:04.822
"Dear Grace, I enjoyed your letter.

54:04.822 --> 54:07.485
"Dear Grace, I enjoyed your letter.

54:07.559 --> 54:10.154
I agree Camp Douglas isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

54:10.229 --> 54:11.821
It never was.

54:11.899 --> 54:14.494
But if you're feeling lonely
or homesick even...

54:14.569 --> 54:18.529
I recommend that, one, you call me.
I'm staying at Bob Mapplethorpe's...

54:18.608 --> 54:21.169
and, two,
that you keep extremely busy.

54:21.245 --> 54:24.409
- lf's working for me.
- Come here, Hector.

54:24.484 --> 54:26.851
I've got a whole, new program.

54:26.921 --> 54:30.517
Bob and I get up at 5:30 every morning
to run our paper route.

54:30.593 --> 54:32.390
I've got three jobs.

54:32.462 --> 54:36.833
The money isn't much, and Bob
isn't suited for this kind of work.

54:36.902 --> 54:38.597
But we keep each other company...

54:38.671 --> 54:42.540
and we both feel much better about
ourselves now that we're working hard.

54:42.610 --> 54:46.638
- Glad you enjoyed it. You all come back.
- Thanks, Mr. Fine.

54:46.716 --> 54:50.653
Jack, I've been working.
I made $75 in tips last night.

54:50.722 --> 54:54.090
Bob's brother, Future Man, has
accumulated some extensive legal debts.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.595
But we're gradually helping him
to pay those off.

54:56.664 --> 54:58.632
Can I at least have three bucks for gas?

54:58.701 --> 55:03.072
I'm also coaching a Little League
soccer team called the Hurricanes.

55:03.141 --> 55:05.702
They're mostly beginners,
but they've got a lot of spirit...

55:05.777 --> 55:08.042
and they don't let defeat get them down.

55:08.114 --> 55:10.139
They remind me of Dignan in that way.

55:10.217 --> 55:14.679
Say what you will about him,
he's no cynic and he's no quitter.

55:14.757 --> 55:17.192
I'm usually so exhausted now
at the end of the day...

55:17.261 --> 55:19.753
so that I don't have time
to think about blown opportunities...

55:19.831 --> 55:21.765
or wasted time.

55:21.834 --> 55:24.531
I do have one bit of advice
for you though, Grace.

55:24.605 --> 55:27.803
Take the time in school
to learn a foreign language.

55:27.876 --> 55:31.938
I myself never did,
and I feel I paid a price for it.

55:33.685 --> 55:35.448
Well, so long, Grace.

55:35.521 --> 55:38.616
I miss you very much.
Donât forget to write me back.

55:38.692 --> 55:40.125
Anthony."

55:40.195 --> 55:42.426
Okay, there he goes.

55:46.704 --> 55:48.569
It's Dignan. Wait up!

55:54.048 --> 55:55.709
Where are you going?

55:55.784 --> 55:58.413
I'm just walking Hector.

55:59.489 --> 56:01.650
How long you been back?

56:01.726 --> 56:03.489
A while.

56:03.561 --> 56:07.054
So how's it goin'?

56:07.133 --> 56:09.659
It's goin' pretty good.

56:16.180 --> 56:18.376
I wish that some of the stuff
that was said...

56:18.450 --> 56:22.319
hadn't been said out there by me...

56:22.389 --> 56:24.084
and...

56:24.158 --> 56:26.491
I'm sorry...

56:26.562 --> 56:27.995
about...

56:30.801 --> 56:33.134
Do you wanna shake hands?

56:42.285 --> 56:44.116
What's this you got on, man?

56:44.187 --> 56:46.656
It's a jumpsuit.

56:46.724 --> 56:48.989
You like it?
I ordered a dozen of them.

56:49.061 --> 56:51.462
Anthony, I'd like to introduce you
to Applejack.

56:51.532 --> 56:54.161
- Applejack, this is Anthony.
- Anthony Adams.

57:00.812 --> 57:02.541
Mr. Henry! It's Dignan!

57:03.482 --> 57:05.313
Got some visitors.

57:07.955 --> 57:10.082
- What time did he say he'd be here?
- Right now.

57:13.964 --> 57:16.263
Did you guys feel that?
I just felt something...

57:16.335 --> 57:18.235
Hey! Jesus Christ!

57:19.305 --> 57:22.070
How's the weather down there?

57:23.611 --> 57:26.206
- Come on in.
- Well, it's locked.

57:26.283 --> 57:28.718
- No, no. Come on, son.
- Okay.

57:28.786 --> 57:31.221
I just tried it,
but I'll try it again.

57:35.029 --> 57:37.054
Yes, it is!

57:38.967 --> 57:40.696
He poured more water on me.

57:43.742 --> 57:46.007
- Dignan, good to see you.
- Hi, Mr. Henry.

57:46.078 --> 57:47.875
Applejack, good to...

57:47.948 --> 57:49.882
And who are you?

57:52.019 --> 57:54.511
- That's Anthony...
- This is no good, bringing him here.

57:54.591 --> 57:57.459
What the shit, man?
What are you thinking?

57:57.528 --> 57:59.223
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

58:01.334 --> 58:02.596
How are you?

58:04.204 --> 58:07.106
This is my business manager, Rowboat.

58:07.175 --> 58:09.974
Get you a little wet, did I, son?
Come on in, boys.

58:10.046 --> 58:11.980
There you go.

58:15.020 --> 58:17.285
That's it.
Give it a little topspin.

58:17.357 --> 58:19.154
A little more!

58:20.495 --> 58:21.962
Good. He listens.

58:23.266 --> 58:26.327
- This kid in?
- I don't know. Are you in?

58:30.676 --> 58:30.709
- You don't understand.
- Let me tell you about this job.

58:30.709 --> 58:32.506
- You don't understand.
- Let me tell you about this job.

58:32.579 --> 58:35.515
I got this program
and I'm trying to stick to it, okay?

58:35.584 --> 58:37.518
Just hear me out.

58:39.355 --> 58:43.156
It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Here are a few of the key ingredients:

58:43.228 --> 58:46.756
dynamite, pole vaulting,
laughing gas, choppers...

58:46.834 --> 58:50.532
Can you see how incredible
this is going to be? Come on!

58:50.605 --> 58:52.539
I can't do it.

58:54.711 --> 58:57.875
I know, but if he doesn't have
the enthusiasm, then who needs him?

58:57.950 --> 59:00.784
Oh, you said a mouthful.

59:00.854 --> 59:03.187
If you want, I could speak to him.

59:03.257 --> 59:05.488
Would you, Mr. Henry?
That'd be great.

59:05.560 --> 59:08.530
- Sugar cone?
- You bet.

59:08.599 --> 59:10.692
- Do you want anything, Anthony?
- No, thanks.

59:13.005 --> 59:15.975
Listen.

59:16.042 --> 59:19.206
You know...

59:19.281 --> 59:21.614
you're breaking his heart,
you know that, don't you?

59:23.287 --> 59:27.019
What do you mean?

59:27.092 --> 59:29.857
Kid that worked
on one of my garden crews...

59:29.930 --> 59:33.298
I mean, nice fella,
but he didn't perform.

59:33.368 --> 59:35.837
So I had to fire him.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.770
Then six months later...

59:38.843 --> 59:42.075
I get a call from a gas station...

59:42.147 --> 59:44.172
about 200 miles
outside of Victoria there.

59:44.250 --> 59:47.049
I said, "What the hell
are you doing out there?"

59:47.122 --> 59:48.714
But there's something in his voice.

59:48.790 --> 59:51.123
You know what I'm saying?

59:51.193 --> 59:54.459
I felt for him.
I mean, poor guy.

59:54.532 --> 59:57.161
Here he is, he thought he had a team.

59:57.236 --> 01:00:00.035
Turns out to be a man alone.

01:00:01.108 --> 01:00:03.839
And that's tough, man.
Real tough.

01:00:03.912 --> 01:00:05.743
Here you go.

01:00:23.908 --> 01:00:26.935
- Had any time to think?
- Yeah, I've done a lot of thinking.

01:00:42.702 --> 01:00:45.137
We're still holding
your position open for you.

01:00:45.206 --> 01:00:47.402
Yeah, I wish you wouldn't do that.

01:00:47.476 --> 01:00:50.640
- Come on. Go for a ride.
- It's too small for the both of us.

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:52.945
No it isn't. Jump on.
I'll give you a pump.

01:00:53.018 --> 01:00:56.420
- Where'd you get this?
- I got it from a fr...

01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:05.191
What are you wearing?

01:01:05.269 --> 01:01:07.100
It's a jumpsuit.

01:01:07.171 --> 01:01:10.403
- Clay, look at this guy.
- He looks like a rodeo clown.

01:01:10.476 --> 01:01:12.843
He looks like a little banana.
Where are you from anyway, man?

01:01:12.913 --> 01:01:15.074
I'm from around here.

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.640
- He used to mow our lawn.
- No shit?

01:01:16.719 --> 01:01:20.747
He was great... clipping the hedges,
sweeping up, mowing the lawn.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.291
What was the name
of your little lawn mowing company?

01:01:25.365 --> 01:01:26.957
The Lawn Wranglers.

01:01:29.371 --> 01:01:30.963
Let's go.

01:01:33.242 --> 01:01:35.301
Keep up the mowing, kemo sabe.

01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:43.148
It was landscaping, not just mowing.

01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:44.816
Man, don't listen to that guy.

01:01:44.893 --> 01:01:46.918
I don't know.
Sometimes l...

01:01:46.996 --> 01:01:49.089
I'm not always as confident as I look.

01:01:49.166 --> 01:01:51.533
- Did you see what he had on?
- Yeah.

01:01:51.603 --> 01:01:53.662
It was pretty cool.

01:01:55.242 --> 01:01:56.937
All right.

01:01:58.012 --> 01:01:59.946
Wait a second.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:04.551
What?

01:02:11.098 --> 01:02:15.331
Goddamn it. I'm in.

01:02:16.539 --> 01:02:19.202
- What?
- I'm in.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.268
I knew you'd be back.

01:02:21.347 --> 01:02:23.281
Three conditions.

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:26.286
One: you mastermind the plan.

01:02:28.657 --> 01:02:31.388
Two: Bob's on the team.

01:02:31.461 --> 01:02:33.520
Let's hear the third one.

01:02:38.705 --> 01:02:40.832
You gotta get me one of these jumpsuits.

01:02:40.909 --> 01:02:42.342
- You like these?
- Yeah!

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:44.879
Done. Deal. All right.

01:02:44.947 --> 01:02:48.111
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, I know I am.

01:02:48.186 --> 01:02:50.815
All right. I'll see you later on.

01:02:53.928 --> 01:02:57.262
- Need any help?
- No, I think I got it.

01:03:04.844 --> 01:03:06.573
Ha-ha! Got the eye.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.921
Got the eye again.

01:03:18.296 --> 01:03:20.891
Well, move back a little bit!

01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:23.300
Hi, guys.
Welcome back.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.772
- He's back, Mr. Henry.
- Where's Bob? The rich kid?

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:30.736
- Hey, what do you say?
- How's it goin'?

01:03:30.815 --> 01:03:32.874
Dignan! What do you say?
Come on in.

01:03:32.951 --> 01:03:35.182
- Oh, nothing much.
- What are you guys drinking?

01:03:35.255 --> 01:03:38.350
- Water for me, please.
- I'll have a Tom Collins, please.

01:03:38.425 --> 01:03:39.949
Tom Collins. Okay.

01:03:40.028 --> 01:03:43.123
I want you to know it was really too bad
about what happened out there.

01:03:43.199 --> 01:03:45.498
- I'm glad to see you.
- Yeah, it was unfortunate.

01:03:45.569 --> 01:03:47.765
- Let's not even talk about it.
- It was stupid.

01:03:47.839 --> 01:03:49.739
It was real stupid.
It was extremely stupid.

01:03:49.808 --> 01:03:53.176
I want you to know
I don't expect an apology.

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:55.944
Can you believe this guy?
"I don't expect an apology."

01:03:56.018 --> 01:03:59.614
- Let's not get into this.
- Of course you don't wanna get into it.

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:01.851
You would have let my brother
rot in fucking jail!

01:04:01.927 --> 01:04:05.022
- You said 48 hours!
- I never agreed to that.

01:04:05.097 --> 01:04:07.896
- That's a lie!
- Bullshit!

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.530
- Backyard! Right now! Let's go!
- Just wait here.

01:04:10.606 --> 01:04:15.705
- Come on, Bob.
- Backyard? This is my house, asshole!

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:17.441
- Get out here!
- Wait a second!

01:04:17.516 --> 01:04:20.680
I know you're feeling angry
and I think the thing to do is...

01:04:20.754 --> 01:04:22.722
- We're all here. Let's talk.
- Wait a second!

01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:25.886
Bob is a big boy.
Now, we are in the real world.

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:29.956
We don't settle problems with hugs. We
settle them with bare-knuckle tactics.

01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:33.232
Let's talk about that.
????????

01:04:33.305 --> 01:04:35.466
- Fine!
- Bob, stay there!

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:38.944
- In my own house?
- Stop it!

01:04:40.116 --> 01:04:42.813
Just stop!

01:04:42.886 --> 01:04:46.323
- You got me with a left hook.
- Okay, no more fighting.

01:04:46.391 --> 01:04:48.154
Bob, come here.

01:04:48.227 --> 01:04:50.526
I'm gonna hug him.

01:04:52.467 --> 01:04:55.096
What are we doing out here?
What happened?

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:56.569
Man!

01:04:56.639 --> 01:04:59.939
- You went crazy.
- I know. I just... I don't know.

01:05:00.012 --> 01:05:02.139
- Come here.
- I was looking forward to seeing you.

01:05:02.215 --> 01:05:06.084
Bob, we'd like to have you on the team,
if you'll have us.

01:05:06.154 --> 01:05:09.682
Roberto, let me get something straight.

01:05:09.759 --> 01:05:12.752
- You don't play any tennis.
- No.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:16.858
- And you don't play any golf.
- No.

01:05:16.936 --> 01:05:19.428
So why do you belong to a country club?

01:05:21.008 --> 01:05:22.805
You got me.

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:24.675
You're a piece of work.

01:05:24.747 --> 01:05:27.615
- The food is very good.
- Well, yeah. You just sign.

01:05:27.684 --> 01:05:30.245
My work is the finger work.

01:05:30.322 --> 01:05:32.256
Usually my work is...

01:05:33.326 --> 01:05:36.421
Little sound and good touch.

01:05:36.498 --> 01:05:38.557
- How you doin', Bob?
- Hey, Jackson.

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:41.196
When will your folks
be back in town?

01:05:41.272 --> 01:05:43.935
That's hard to say.
Last I heard they were in Singapore.

01:05:44.009 --> 01:05:47.844
Your brother was up here the other day.
He said you ran away from home.

01:05:47.915 --> 01:05:49.644
- What?
- You ran away from home.

01:05:49.717 --> 01:05:51.514
Oh, shit.

01:05:52.555 --> 01:05:57.051
- I'll see you.
- Hi, guys. Bob, fancy seeing you here.

01:05:57.128 --> 01:05:58.993
The rest of the gang?

01:05:59.064 --> 01:06:00.827
- Hi, John Mapplethorpe.
- Kumar.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.492
Nice to meet you.

01:06:04.071 --> 01:06:06.666
Applejack, nice to meet you.

01:06:06.741 --> 01:06:10.007
- John, great pleasure to meet you.
- And your name is?

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.845
Jackson said you told him
I ran away from home.

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:15.010
I might have mentioned it.

01:06:15.087 --> 01:06:17.556
I'm 26 years old.
I didn't run away from home.

01:06:17.624 --> 01:06:20.685
Oh, that's right.
You're on that top secret mission.

01:06:20.762 --> 01:06:23.664
I'm sorry. I forgot I wasn't
supposed to say anything.

01:06:25.336 --> 01:06:28.306
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
run around telling lies about me.

01:06:28.373 --> 01:06:30.638
I'm sorry. I apologize.

01:06:30.711 --> 01:06:34.204
I know you have a reputation to uphold.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:36.945
It won't happen again.

01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:39.682
- Jonathan.
- Yeah?

01:06:42.528 --> 01:06:44.359
You know, Jonathan...

01:06:45.331 --> 01:06:48.495
the world needs dreamers.

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:50.561
- Excuse me?
- No, I don't think so.

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:55.378
You know, one day I believe
that you're gonna wake up...

01:06:55.446 --> 01:06:57.711
and realize you no longer
have a brother...

01:06:57.783 --> 01:07:00.685
and you no longer have any friends,
and on that day...

01:07:00.754 --> 01:07:04.555
I'm gonna be standing front and center
just laughing my fuckin' head off.

01:07:14.006 --> 01:07:15.439
God!

01:07:16.945 --> 01:07:18.936
I'm just messin' around with my brother.

01:07:19.014 --> 01:07:20.709
- Are we okay here?
- Okay.

01:07:30.331 --> 01:07:32.492
I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob...

01:07:33.568 --> 01:07:35.901
but your brother's a cocksucker.

01:07:35.973 --> 01:07:37.463
- I know.
- Did I offend you?

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:39.908
- That didn't offend me.
- Good.

01:07:51.662 --> 01:07:54.928
Well, welcome
I've got a beautiful house

01:07:56.002 --> 01:08:00.600
Hispanic male, nonsmoker,
enters white van, southwest door.

01:08:00.675 --> 01:08:02.734
- Mark that down.
- I did.

01:08:03.812 --> 01:08:07.442
There you go.
Drive away, just like you always do.

01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:14.555
We got it, man. We know it backwards,
and we know it forewords...

01:08:14.628 --> 01:08:17.223
because we've done the legwork,
and we've done the research.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.461
And now it pays off tomorrow.

01:08:19.536 --> 01:08:22.267
- Just gotta follow through.
- What are you working on?

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.274
Let me show you this.

01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:28.011
Wow, that's one of your little drawings.

01:08:28.082 --> 01:08:31.416
There he goes... pole vaults over the
thing. There he goes, and there he is.

01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:34.854
I love the drawings. I love it.
You're creative.

01:08:34.925 --> 01:08:37.587
Tell me something.

01:08:38.662 --> 01:08:40.596
What do you think of Inez?

01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:43.067
- As a person?
- Yeah, as a girl.

01:08:44.738 --> 01:08:47.174
I liked her.

01:08:47.242 --> 01:08:50.076
I thought she was a good person.
She was friendly.

01:08:50.147 --> 01:08:53.743
She was attractive. I didn't get
to know her as well as you did.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:56.220
That's the only reason
I even bother to hesitate.

01:08:56.290 --> 01:09:00.091
That kid Rocky struck me
as kind of a weirdo.

01:09:00.161 --> 01:09:02.287
What? Rocky?

01:09:02.365 --> 01:09:04.299
- I mean, he said he loved you.
- What?

01:09:04.368 --> 01:09:06.063
Yeah, he said he loved you.

01:09:06.136 --> 01:09:08.127
- Was he...
- I mean, that just seemed strange.

01:09:08.207 --> 01:09:10.004
Was he translating?

01:09:11.746 --> 01:09:15.148
Was he translating for me
when he said he loved you?

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:17.151
He said he loved you.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.288
He wasn't translating.
That's how I understood him.

01:09:20.358 --> 01:09:24.022
He was talking in English.
I was like, "What? Okay. l..."

01:09:24.095 --> 01:09:26.029
Whoa! Anthony, where are you going?

01:09:26.099 --> 01:09:29.627
He's just a mixed-up kid!
Anthony, come on!

01:09:29.705 --> 01:09:32.607
You're blowing our cover.
Maybe I didn't understand him.

01:09:32.675 --> 01:09:35.042
I'm calling for a motel.
I don't know the area code.

01:09:35.113 --> 01:09:36.944
I just know the name of the motel.

01:09:37.015 --> 01:09:40.816
- Listen, can I borrow him a minute?
- All right. Sure.

01:09:40.888 --> 01:09:42.822
I was thinking.

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:46.122
It might give you a feeling of security
if I went in there with you tomorrow.

01:09:46.196 --> 01:09:48.529
You know, just for backup.

01:09:48.599 --> 01:09:51.330
- Huh, Chicky?
- Oh, that's right.

01:09:51.403 --> 01:09:53.770
Well, I mean, it couldn't hurt,
could it?

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.537
No, it couldn't hurt, but...

01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:01.912
You gotta weigh the pros and cons.
You're the one who hipped me to that.

01:10:01.985 --> 01:10:04.386
Shoot, well, what are the cons?

01:10:04.456 --> 01:10:07.221
Cons... if you go in there tomorrow...

01:10:07.293 --> 01:10:10.263
then it's just another score
by Abe Henry.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.060
That's true.

01:10:13.769 --> 01:10:16.170
Can I speak to Inez, please?

01:10:16.239 --> 01:10:20.176
She's one of the housekeepers.
She worked there for a while.

01:10:20.245 --> 01:10:22.270
Please don't do this to me, ma'am.

01:10:22.348 --> 01:10:24.339
Look, I'll... Let me see what I can do.

01:10:24.418 --> 01:10:26.887
Well, it's your decision.

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.448
If it's okay with you...

01:10:31.529 --> 01:10:33.760
it would mean a lot to me...

01:10:33.832 --> 01:10:36.529
if you'd let me try this one alone.

01:10:36.603 --> 01:10:38.936
Damn. I'II tell you something, kid.

01:10:39.006 --> 01:10:41.737
You've got the guts of a damn lion.

01:10:42.678 --> 01:10:44.168
Housekeeping.

01:10:44.247 --> 01:10:46.238
Carmen, how's it goin'?

01:10:46.316 --> 01:10:48.877
Yeah, I'm looking for Inez.
Have you seen her today? Is she in?

01:10:49.955 --> 01:10:51.889
She's not here.

01:10:51.958 --> 01:10:54.223
Hey, man. How's it goin'?

01:11:07.047 --> 01:11:07.979
Hello.

01:11:08.048 --> 01:11:11.576
I'm looking for Inez.
She's one of the housekeepers.

01:11:12.655 --> 01:11:15.591
- She is?
- Yeah, she is. Hold on.

01:11:21.802 --> 01:11:24.237
- It's for you. Telephone.
- Thank you.

01:11:31.082 --> 01:11:34.519
Yes!
She recognizes my voice!

01:11:36.156 --> 01:11:38.751
No, I'm at a party.

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:41.058
God, you sound terrific.
How are you?

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:44.958
That's great!

01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:47.436
No, I'm great,
especially now that I got you.

01:11:47.506 --> 01:11:50.806
I've been looking all over for you.
I talked to every person at the hotel.

01:11:50.877 --> 01:11:52.845
When am I going to see you?

01:11:54.249 --> 01:11:56.684
Gosh, your English is really improving.

01:11:56.753 --> 01:11:59.848
- It sounds... You're fluent now, Inez!
- Thank you.

01:12:00.792 --> 01:12:03.387
So the word on the street...

01:12:03.463 --> 01:12:05.624
Or should I say...

01:12:05.699 --> 01:12:09.136
rumor has it that, well...

01:12:10.806 --> 01:12:12.501
I heard you love me.

01:12:15.413 --> 01:12:17.574
Yes, I do.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:21.018
Yes!

01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:24.024
God, Inez!

01:12:47.026 --> 01:12:48.550
Bird Dog to Scarecrow.

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:52.959
- Come in.
- Go ahead, Bird Dog.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:56.062
I got a visual read on you.
You're all clear.

01:12:56.139 --> 01:12:58.768
Outstanding, Bird Dog.
Outstanding. Stand by.

01:12:58.843 --> 01:13:00.868
Let's go!

01:13:00.946 --> 01:13:02.743
Kumar, are you ready?

01:13:02.816 --> 01:13:04.477
- Yes.
- Let's get lucky!

01:13:08.391 --> 01:13:10.952
Everybody move! Let's go!
Keep up the intensity!

01:13:12.097 --> 01:13:14.122
Come on!

01:13:14.199 --> 01:13:15.826
Scarecrow?

01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:19.338
- Come in, Jackknife.
- Is everything all right up there, man?

01:13:19.407 --> 01:13:22.639
Affirmative. We're approaching
the elevator right now on my left.

01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:24.872
- Stand by. Come in, Bird Dog.
- Copy.

01:13:24.948 --> 01:13:28.385
- Move you your second position. Fast!
- I'm moving.

01:13:31.557 --> 01:13:35.187
You guys take the elevator.
I'm gonna secure the stairway.

01:13:35.263 --> 01:13:37.562
- Kumar, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:13:37.633 --> 01:13:40.865
I'm heading up the stairway. Everything
looks good. I just hit my knee!

01:13:40.938 --> 01:13:43.737
Testing! Kumar!

01:13:43.809 --> 01:13:47.041
What? I'm okay.

01:13:47.114 --> 01:13:49.048
Stop! Get it down! Go!

01:13:51.788 --> 01:13:54.087
Let's go. Go.
Where are you goin'? Come here.

01:13:54.158 --> 01:13:56.719
Rendezvous at the checkpoint
in six minutes.

01:13:56.795 --> 01:13:59.094
Checkpoint!

01:13:59.165 --> 01:14:01.999
- Who's that man?
- What do you mean?

01:14:02.069 --> 01:14:04.003
That's Applejack! Come on!

01:14:13.486 --> 01:14:15.751
- Where we are going?
- Right down the corridor here.

01:14:15.823 --> 01:14:17.916
- Are you nervous?
- Yes, I am nervous.

01:14:21.998 --> 01:14:23.761
There it is. Oh, boy.

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.530
That's perfect.

01:14:30.811 --> 01:14:32.073
No problem.

01:14:32.146 --> 01:14:34.445
Hey, Jackknife, come in.

01:14:34.517 --> 01:14:37.248
- Yeah.
- You know somethin'?

01:14:37.321 --> 01:14:38.754
What?

01:14:43.196 --> 01:14:45.130
I really don't wanna do this robbery.

01:14:45.198 --> 01:14:48.430
- You know?
- Man, neither do I.

01:14:48.503 --> 01:14:52.497
- Do you want me to come up there?
- Keep this line clear at all times.

01:14:52.576 --> 01:14:54.407
Come on. Any activity, Bird Dog?

01:14:54.479 --> 01:14:56.310
Negatory. We're all clear.

01:14:56.382 --> 01:14:58.578
Good. lf's supposed to be.

01:14:58.652 --> 01:15:01.281
I got a pretty spectacular view
from up here.

01:15:01.356 --> 01:15:06.455
I can see the whole city from the east
side all the way to the west side.

01:15:06.529 --> 01:15:09.021
Anthony, the elevator's moving.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.261
- Who's on the elevator?
- I don't know.

01:15:11.336 --> 01:15:13.703
Well, check it!
It's moving right now!

01:15:25.591 --> 01:15:28.356
Bob, what are you doing?

01:15:28.428 --> 01:15:30.659
- My walkie-talkie busted.
- Give it to me!

01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:33.462
- Did you drop it? Come on!
- No, I didn't drop it!

01:15:33.536 --> 01:15:35.470
You're supposed to be
on the loading dock!

01:15:35.539 --> 01:15:38.509
You go down there.
I'm by myself down there!

01:15:40.212 --> 01:15:42.613
- Move it!
- What's going on?

01:15:42.683 --> 01:15:44.776
It was Bob.
He dropped his walkie-talkie.

01:15:44.852 --> 01:15:47.720
Who's watching the door?
Get back in position, assholes!

01:15:52.363 --> 01:15:54.855
Applejack, talk to me.
What's going on?

01:15:54.934 --> 01:15:56.834
Somebody's coming out of there.

01:15:56.903 --> 01:15:58.700
- Look!
- Jesus Christ!

01:15:58.772 --> 01:16:00.535
Hold it right there, guys!

01:16:00.608 --> 01:16:01.836
- Freeze!
- Come this way.

01:16:01.911 --> 01:16:03.936
Come here! Up against this wall!
Come here!

01:16:04.014 --> 01:16:06.005
Up against this wall! Move!

01:16:06.084 --> 01:16:08.485
- Move!
- Right here!

01:16:08.554 --> 01:16:10.579
- Just look at the ceiling.
- Up against the wall!

01:16:10.657 --> 01:16:12.420
- What are you doing here?
- We work here!

01:16:12.493 --> 01:16:14.860
- You're always at lunch now!
- Not always.

01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:18.389
Yes, always!
Okay, let me think.

01:16:18.468 --> 01:16:21.097
Time!

01:16:21.172 --> 01:16:22.730
Hold on! Jesus!

01:16:22.807 --> 01:16:26.437
- What the hell are you doing here?
- My walkie-talkie broke, man.

01:16:26.513 --> 01:16:28.105
- Two minutes.
- Good.

01:16:28.182 --> 01:16:31.118
- Put on your masks!
- They've already seen our faces, Dignan!

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:32.619
Put on your masks!

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:36.217
Kumar, we've got problems.
What are you doing sitting down?

01:16:36.294 --> 01:16:39.856
- I tried. I could not get it.
- You can't get it?

01:16:39.932 --> 01:16:42.231
- No, I could not do it.
- Come on, man!

01:16:42.302 --> 01:16:44.601
Bob, will you please put the mask on.

01:16:44.673 --> 01:16:46.072
- Or turn away.
- I can't get it on!

01:16:46.142 --> 01:16:47.700
Dignan, what's goin' on?

01:16:47.778 --> 01:16:51.306
- Where's Kumar?
- Forget it, then. Just forget it!

01:16:51.383 --> 01:16:54.376
You can't do it, because you
never knew how in the first place!

01:16:54.454 --> 01:16:56.149
You are totally lost out here!

01:16:57.525 --> 01:16:59.618
- What are you guys doin' here?
- Hold it!

01:16:59.694 --> 01:17:03.187
- Who are these guys?
- Jesus!

01:17:04.903 --> 01:17:07.429
- Jesus, Bob! What the hell...?
- Put it down, big guy!

01:17:07.506 --> 01:17:10.169
- What is your problem?
- I didn't do anything!

01:17:11.245 --> 01:17:14.682
- Are you okay?
- Did you shoot him?

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.117
He must be having a heart attack
or something!

01:17:17.187 --> 01:17:18.779
Drop your smoke.
Let's go!

01:17:18.856 --> 01:17:20.255
Come on!

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.325
Check his pulse!

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:30.003
- Check his pulse!
- Get to the elevator!

01:17:30.072 --> 01:17:32.371
- I can't see.
- A little more!

01:17:32.443 --> 01:17:34.001
I can't believe this!

01:17:34.078 --> 01:17:37.708
- I didn't shoot him.
- He's got a bum ticker, man!

01:17:37.784 --> 01:17:40.652
Hang in there, man.
Hang in there.

01:17:40.721 --> 01:17:43.350
Prop him up. Come on.
Get him up there.

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:45.987
- Get up. Come on, man.
- He don't look good.

01:17:47.464 --> 01:17:49.261
- What is this?
- Stay calm. Stay where you are.

01:17:49.334 --> 01:17:53.739
- Who tripped the alarm, man?
- It's the fire alarm!

01:17:53.807 --> 01:17:57.369
- Who tripped the fire alarm?
- It's because of all this fuckin' smoke!

01:17:57.446 --> 01:17:59.711
Where's Kumar?

01:18:03.755 --> 01:18:08.251
- We're going down. Let's go!
- Man, I blew it.

01:18:08.328 --> 01:18:11.025
- I blew it, man.
- What were you doing in the freezer?

01:18:11.099 --> 01:18:13.090
I don't know.
I lose my touch, man.

01:18:13.169 --> 01:18:15.730
Did you ever have a touch to lose, man?

01:18:15.806 --> 01:18:17.865
What were you doing in there?

01:18:17.942 --> 01:18:20.001
Let's go!

01:18:23.817 --> 01:18:26.286
- Wait for Kumar.
- Come on, Kumar!

01:18:26.354 --> 01:18:28.288
Hurry up, Kumar!

01:18:31.663 --> 01:18:33.631
- Open your door.
- I can't. It's locked.

01:18:33.699 --> 01:18:35.223
- Open that door!
- Move!

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.008
- The elevator broke.
- What?

01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:44.410
- Where's Applejack?
- He's stuck on the second floor!

01:18:44.481 --> 01:18:46.950
- Between floors up there.
- Did he give you the keys?

01:18:47.018 --> 01:18:49.317
- Applejack drove.
- What happened?

01:18:49.388 --> 01:18:53.257
- I don't know.
- Run!

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.852
Go!

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.559
- What the hell happened to the plan?
- I don't know. Come on.

01:18:57.634 --> 01:18:59.329
- I'll meet you at Bob's. Go!
- What?

01:18:59.403 --> 01:19:01.895
- I gotta get Applejack.
- No, you're not.

01:19:01.974 --> 01:19:03.908
- Yeah, I am.
- No!

01:19:05.879 --> 01:19:08.246
- I gotta fly solo on this, baby.
- Okay, Dignan...

01:19:08.316 --> 01:19:11.684
- I don't have time to argue now!
- I don't have time either!

01:19:11.754 --> 01:19:14.519
Now, you get back to Bob's!
Just go!

01:19:16.829 --> 01:19:18.854
Who is in charge here?

01:19:18.932 --> 01:19:22.334
You are, you dumb son of a bitch!
Now, please leave!

01:19:22.403 --> 01:19:24.634
Give me this one.

01:19:24.706 --> 01:19:28.268
You gotta give me this one.

01:19:28.345 --> 01:19:31.873
Dignan, you know what's gonna happen
if you go back there.

01:19:32.952 --> 01:19:34.977
No, I don't.

01:19:35.055 --> 01:19:37.547
They'll never catch me, man...

01:19:37.625 --> 01:19:39.320
'cause I'm fuckin' innocent.

01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:26.455
Get in here.
Concentrate on your breathing.

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:29.091
You gotta get oxygen to your heart.

01:20:33.907 --> 01:20:36.638
I haven't got the keys.
Unlock the door!

01:20:47.995 --> 01:20:50.260
Freeze! Don't move!

01:20:50.332 --> 01:20:52.733
- Put your hands on the car!
- Put your hands up! Now!

01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:10.320
Drop the gun!

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:37.756
- Freeze!
- Drop it!

01:21:37.835 --> 01:21:39.769
Drop the gun!

01:21:42.408 --> 01:21:44.569
Drop the gun!

01:22:57.918 --> 01:22:59.818
Bob, there he is.

01:23:07.165 --> 01:23:10.192
One month down, twenty-three to go.

01:23:10.269 --> 01:23:12.100
Anyway, I said to the D. A:

01:23:12.172 --> 01:23:15.370
"That cop who hit me
must have given me C.R.S. disease."

01:23:15.444 --> 01:23:18.039
- What's that?
- That's just what the D.A. asked.

01:23:18.114 --> 01:23:20.413
C.R.S. is a disease
where you can't remember shit.

01:23:20.484 --> 01:23:22.281
- Like amnesia.
- Right.

01:23:22.354 --> 01:23:25.324
C.R.S. "Can't remember shit." C.R.S.

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.691
- Tell Mr. Henry I said that.
- Okay.

01:23:30.264 --> 01:23:33.132
So is Mr. Henry gonna come by
and see me or what?

01:23:34.304 --> 01:23:36.238
I don't think so.

01:23:36.307 --> 01:23:39.038
He actually robbed Bob's house.

01:23:39.112 --> 01:23:41.308
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not.

01:23:41.382 --> 01:23:43.613
I can't believe that.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.619
I almost robbed that place myself.

01:23:48.325 --> 01:23:50.658
You think Applejack knew?

01:23:50.728 --> 01:23:55.497
We haven't heard from Applejack
since he got out of the hospital.

01:23:55.568 --> 01:23:57.661
His case got dismissed.

01:23:57.738 --> 01:23:59.672
- What? Why?
- We're not sure.

01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:01.834
We think Mr. Henry had something
to do with it.

01:24:01.911 --> 01:24:05.712
Well, they take the health problems
into account.

01:24:11.058 --> 01:24:15.155
- So what all did he get?
- Pretty much everything.

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:19.190
- I bet he got that grand piano.
- He got everything.

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:22.104
I bet that grand piano's
worth ten grand.

01:24:26.613 --> 01:24:29.082
I'm sorry, Bob.

01:24:30.186 --> 01:24:32.519
Yeah, but you know,
in a strange way...

01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:35.650
it's brought me and Future Man
closer together.

01:24:35.728 --> 01:24:40.099
I mean, we went out
to look for a new piano the other day...

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:43.331
and he looks at me and says:
"Bob, just because you're a fuck-up...

01:24:43.405 --> 01:24:45.168
doesn't mean you're not my brother."

01:24:50.315 --> 01:24:53.683
That kind of touched me.

01:24:53.754 --> 01:24:55.950
He doesn't normally open up like that.

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:01.292
- Hey, I talked to Inez last night.
- Really?

01:25:01.364 --> 01:25:03.993
Gonna be bringing you a care package
when she comes up here.

01:25:04.069 --> 01:25:07.369
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.537
She liked me.
Oh, yeah. Hang on to that one.

01:25:11.613 --> 01:25:14.139
You want anything special?

01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:22.019
Well...

01:25:22.095 --> 01:25:24.724
- I got something for you guys.
- Oh, yeah?

01:25:24.799 --> 01:25:27.234
Belt buckles that I made.

01:25:27.302 --> 01:25:29.065
There's one for you and one for you.

01:25:29.138 --> 01:25:32.802
I made a couple more
that I was gonna give...

01:25:32.877 --> 01:25:34.811
to, you know, Applejack,
Kumar or Mr. Henry.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.679
But... I don't know.
Maybe give it to Inez.

01:25:37.751 --> 01:25:39.776
I don't care. Give it to those guys.

01:25:39.854 --> 01:25:42.323
I don't have any hard feelings.

01:25:42.391 --> 01:25:45.850
Here's a little piece.

01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:47.864
That's for the tip.

01:25:52.539 --> 01:25:54.735
- Thanks.
- We did it though, didn't we?

01:25:59.082 --> 01:26:01.677
Yeah, we did it, all right.

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:10.190
Well, thank you for comin'.

01:26:13.102 --> 01:26:14.694
It's good seein' you.

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:21.776
- Did you bring that grappling hook?
- Grappling hook?

01:26:21.849 --> 01:26:23.908
I think I might have found
a way out of here.

01:26:23.986 --> 01:26:26.421
- You're kidding!
- No, I'm not.

01:26:26.489 --> 01:26:29.391
- How?
- Wait for my instructions.

01:26:30.427 --> 01:26:33.124
When we go through the next gate, you'll
have 30 seconds to take out the guard.

01:26:33.199 --> 01:26:34.257
- What?
- 30 seconds!

01:26:34.333 --> 01:26:36.632
Have the car running
at the northwest checkpoint.

01:26:36.703 --> 01:26:40.572
- Bob and I will scale the barricade.
- Hold on!

01:26:40.643 --> 01:26:45.105
And Bob, remember, shield me from
the bullets! They won't shoot civilians!

01:26:45.182 --> 01:26:46.979
- Are you ready?
- Hold on!

01:26:47.052 --> 01:26:50.079
Let's go! Now!

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.868
Isn't it funny how you used to be
in the nuthouse and now I'm in jail?
