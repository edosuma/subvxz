02:19.973 --> 02:22.877
<i>On September the 5th, 1977,</i>

02:22.977 --> 02:28.179
<i>NASA launched the spacecraft</i> Voyager.
<i>Destination unknown.</i>

02:28.448 --> 02:34.218
<i>Its only cargo a set of records curated
by American astronomer Carl Sagan.</i>

02:34.755 --> 02:37.558
<i>The collection was designed
to last a billion years</i>

02:37.658 --> 02:43.294
<i>and potentially give extraterrestrial
life a glimpse at humankind.</i>

02:43.897 --> 02:48.232
<i>The records were printed in gold-plated
copper to prevent corrosion,</i>

02:49.102 --> 02:51.936
<i>and included international music,</i>

02:52.038 --> 02:54.872
<i>greetings in 59 languages,</i>

02:55.141 --> 02:57.710
<i>the crashing of an ocean wave,</i>

02:57.810 --> 03:00.447
<i>wind through an oak tree,</i>

03:00.547 --> 03:04.718
<i>whale calls, the human heartbeat,</i>

03:04.818 --> 03:07.151
<i>and the sound of a kiss.</i>

03:11.224 --> 03:15.096
<i>At around 12:15 p.m.,
Central Standard Time,</i>

03:15.196 --> 03:18.500
<i>just as</i> Voyager <i>approached
the edge of our solar system,</i>

03:19.100 --> 03:21.916
<i>back on Earth,
in an unremarkable suburb,</i>

03:22.536 --> 03:26.904
<i>Don Truby was attempting
to log onto BangBus.com,</i>

03:27.707 --> 03:30.344
<i>a pornographic website
featuring young actresses</i>

03:30.444 --> 03:33.377
<i>in the roles of helpless hitchhikers.</i>

03:35.448 --> 03:40.961
<i>However, the accumulation of malware
had rendered his computer useless.</i>

03:43.123 --> 03:47.628
<i>Don gave a brief thought to masturbating
using only his imagination,</i>

03:47.728 --> 03:51.779
<i>but the sheer quality and variety
of the Internet had left his brain</i>

03:51.879 --> 03:54.532
<i>an inferior substitute.</i>

03:58.204 --> 04:01.976
<i>In order to access the limitless
fountain of pornography</i>

04:02.076 --> 04:04.645
<i>that he had become accustomed to,</i>

04:04.745 --> 04:09.046
<i>Don would have to use the only
remaining computer in the house.</i>

04:09.983 --> 04:13.484
<i>The one belonging to
his 15-year-old son.</i>

04:33.005 --> 04:35.741
Y-O-U...

04:35.841 --> 04:39.343
P-O-R-N.

04:50.890 --> 04:54.492
<i>Don had purchased the computer
for his son's birthday.</i>

04:56.729 --> 04:59.196
<i>It was meant for homework.</i>

04:59.982 --> 05:02.066
Jesus.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.282
<i>He couldn't help think
back to his own childhood</i>

05:15.382 --> 05:18.352
<i>when he discovered his father's
secret stash of magazines</i>

05:18.452 --> 05:22.253
<i>while searching for a
bicycle wrench in the garage.</i>

05:23.223 --> 05:28.060
<i>He felt a sadness about not being
a part of that moment for his son.</i>

05:28.160 --> 05:32.796
<i>A moment he considered to be
an intrinsic part of growing up.</i>

05:33.232 --> 05:36.300
<i>Almost a passing of the torch.</i>

05:45.478 --> 05:50.014
<i>Good afternoon, teachers and students...
just a reminder to all students...</i>

05:58.524 --> 06:03.897
<i>Like many Texas high schools, the pride
of East Vista was their football program.</i>

06:03.997 --> 06:07.067
<i>The key to their junior
varsity team winning district</i>

06:07.167 --> 06:09.970
<i>was sophomore running back Tim Mooney,</i>

06:10.070 --> 06:14.972
<i>a one-man scoring machine that had
carried them to victory as a freshman.</i>

06:29.379 --> 06:30.823
Hey.

06:31.023 --> 06:34.181
Of all the posters in this school,
you had to deface mine.

06:35.495 --> 06:38.842
- I thought it was an improvement.
- You think this is funny?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.869
"DTF?" I know what DTF means.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.138
Tim? Come on back.

06:45.238 --> 06:49.006
I just thought about it a lot and...

06:49.442 --> 06:52.037
sports just sort of seem

06:52.137 --> 06:54.772
a little... pointless.

06:55.237 --> 06:58.944
Sports are not pointless, Tim.
These are the best years of your life!

06:59.094 --> 07:01.024
You don't just throw God's
gifts away like that.

07:01.124 --> 07:04.424
Well... But that's why you
need football right now.

07:04.724 --> 07:08.826
We need you on the team.
Have you told your father?

07:10.196 --> 07:14.301
- Yeah, yeah, he knows.
- Look. We know you're having a tough year.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.238
I'm sure everything with your parents...

07:17.838 --> 07:21.539
I'm sure your mom left a mighty
big hole in your life at home.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.312
How about I have a word
with your teachers

07:25.412 --> 07:29.146
about easing up on your homework?
How's that sound?

07:33.185 --> 07:36.290
You are seriously skinny this year.

07:36.890 --> 07:40.427
Thanks. I went on this super
diet over the summer.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.763
In my opinion it worked.
I mean, you look really great.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.405
I tried not eating one summer,

07:44.505 --> 07:48.502
but my boobs dropped a size, so I quit.
Can't be having that.

07:49.002 --> 07:52.539
- You and Danny are so cute together.
- Thanks! Right?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.807
Have you guys hooked up yet?

07:54.907 --> 07:59.246
Yeah! Yeah. I mean, like, a little.
You know I'm not, like, a total slut.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.615
It's a new era for women, okay?
Just because

08:02.715 --> 08:07.018
I'm comfortable with my body and enjoy
hooking up doesn't make me a slut.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.954
Who do you hook up with anyway?

08:09.213 --> 08:12.700
Just this older guy I met when
my mom and I were in Florida.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.594
Yeah, okay. Check it out.

08:20.337 --> 08:21.538
Oh, my God.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.507
- Was it gross?
- No.

08:26.807 --> 08:30.009
It wasn't that bad.
It was kind of salty, I guess.

08:30.409 --> 08:32.576
Did you let him, like,

08:32.812 --> 08:36.400
you know, finish in your mouth?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.374
Allison!

08:38.818 --> 08:41.687
Yeah. How else would
I know it was salty?

08:41.787 --> 08:43.724
Why would you even
have him take a photo?

08:43.823 --> 08:46.157
I need to know what my
audience is seeing.

08:46.759 --> 08:49.467
Anyways, I'm just saying, it's...

08:49.567 --> 08:52.730
It's like a... it's like
a natural progression.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.508
And if you don't sleep
with somebody soon

08:55.708 --> 08:58.239
you're gonna be completely
retarded in bed

08:58.339 --> 09:01.972
when you're a junior and it counts.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.479
My mom's here! See ya, bitches!

09:19.658 --> 09:21.193
Hi, baby!

09:23.462 --> 09:25.265
New outfit?

09:25.365 --> 09:28.801
Another request came in today,
so I stopped at Hot Topic.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.166
It's cute, right?

10:12.645 --> 10:15.115
Okay, you've read through
every solitary interaction

10:15.215 --> 10:19.119
I've had on every single website, Mom.
I think I'm safe from "the predators."

10:19.219 --> 10:21.754
Oh, really? What is this?

10:21.854 --> 10:24.757
"U R hawt." Who is Derrick G.?

10:26.260 --> 10:28.095
- A friend of a friend?
- He's an adult.

10:28.195 --> 10:32.431
So? I can't help if some random
guy finds my picture cute. Jeez.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.231
I can.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.168
Are you serious?

10:38.337 --> 10:40.563
Well, now we don't have to worry
about him being inappropriate.

10:40.663 --> 10:42.643
Yeah, I'd really hate to get
any more compliments, Mom.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.648
It could really do a lot
of permanent damage.

10:44.877 --> 10:48.011
Honey, you know I just
do this to keep you safe.

10:49.047 --> 10:50.781
Whatever.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.617
I love you, sweetie.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.922
- I love you, too.
- Okay, let me see your phone.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.700
<i>During these weekly spot-checks,</i>

11:03.800 --> 11:07.405
<i>Brandy would divulge every username

11:07.967 --> 11:09.503
<i>As an additional precaution,</i>

11:09.603 --> 11:12.729
<i>Patricia installed a device that
monitored all incoming messages</i>

11:12.829 --> 11:16.907
<i>and recorded every keystroke
her daughter ever made.</i>

11:35.227 --> 11:38.899
- We got six new subscribers today.
- That's awesome!

11:38.999 --> 11:42.436
<i>The website had been the
idea of a local talent agent.</i>

11:42.536 --> 11:45.672
<i>Each time she received an
email or a new subscriber,</i>

11:45.772 --> 11:48.639
<i>Hannah felt a little bit
more like a celebrity.</i>

11:49.575 --> 11:51.577
- You sure you're comfortable?
- Yeah.

11:51.677 --> 11:55.179
Okay. Here we go!

12:01.734 --> 12:03.654
Hey, Dad.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.089
Tim Mooney quit.

12:07.292 --> 12:08.826
No kidding?

12:10.996 --> 12:12.532
Brutal.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.966
What kind of mother abandons her family

12:16.836 --> 12:19.236
for California?

12:20.306 --> 12:23.774
I've got, like, a pretty hard test
tomorrow so I'm gonna go study.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.483
Yeah, "studying."

12:35.054 --> 12:37.154
What are you talking about?

12:39.091 --> 12:42.062
You know, you're gross. He's 15.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.263
- That's all I did when I was 15.
- Yeah, that I believe.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.418
So, how you feeling?

12:54.273 --> 12:55.339
About what?

12:57.376 --> 12:59.743
Oh, stop, he's right there.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.250
- He can't hear us.
- What, right now?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.853
- It's been almost two months.
- No, it hasn't!

13:05.953 --> 13:09.153
Last time was after that
barbecue at your sister's.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.689
Okay, fine. We'll do it tomorrow.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.559
But it's gotta be quick.

13:16.061 --> 13:18.395
Don't worry, it will be.

<i>Chris Truby began surfing
pornography at the age of 10</i>

13:26.573 --> 13:30.107
<i>with a simple search
of the word "boobs."</i>

13:31.444 --> 13:34.447
<i>This somewhat innocent query
led to a series of clicks,</i>

13:34.547 --> 13:37.083
<i>and within an hour of his first search,</i>

13:37.183 --> 13:42.319
<i>Chris was watching a short video
entitled "Titty Fucking Cum Queen."</i>

13:43.355 --> 13:45.759
<i>He might have thought
this video to be unusual</i>

<i>had it not already been viewed
by three million others.</i>

13:50.896 --> 13:54.968
<i>By age 15, Chris found it
difficult to achieve an erection</i>

13:55.068 --> 14:00.040
<i>without viewing a level of deviance
that fell, well, outside societal norms.</i>

14:00.140 --> 14:04.277

listen to everything I say</i>

Understand?</i>

There she is! Practice run late?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.797
- Shepherd's pie.
- Yup, we got your favorite.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.030
I'm gonna do my homework.
I'll grab something later.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.199
I'll make her up a plate.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.180
- Thank you.
- Dig in.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.851
Let me know if you want seconds.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.761
So did you clean up her Internet?

16:01.361 --> 16:04.561
Yes, honey, I cleaned up her Internet.

- You were so pretty up there!
- How cool would that be!

22:56.509 --> 22:59.379
To, like, actually be on a TV show?

22:59.479 --> 23:03.616
Pretty cool. When I think of
all the auditions and rejection

23:03.716 --> 23:06.119
and dinners and drinks
when I lived in LA...

23:06.219 --> 23:09.652

Nothing. I just thought I'd

23:50.395 --> 23:53.763
Yeah... Okay.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.109
So that took courage.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.514
It's no big deal.

It didn't matter.

24:42.247 --> 24:46.718
- Well, just like that?
- Do you know <i>Pale Blue Dot</i> by Carl Sagan?

24:47.887 --> 24:52.621
- I've heard of Carl Sagan.
- It's just... It's about how...

24:52.991 --> 24:57.462
We're just made up of...
billions of molecules.

24:57.562 --> 25:01.733
Like, the same molecules that have
been around since the Big Bang.

25:01.833 --> 25:06.736
And they'll be around until eventually
the universe crunches into nothing.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.574
I find that comforting.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.269
Okay.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.482
The actions of, like, Hitler, Gandhi,

25:16.582 --> 25:19.682
Jesus Christ,
mean absolutely nothing, then...

25:21.553 --> 25:23.787
It's no big deal if I
don't play football.

25:27.325 --> 25:33.062
It's no big deal if I come over
here and I sit at your table.

25:40.038 --> 25:44.307
<i>There were many other things that
Tim wished to share with Brandy.</i>

25:44.876 --> 25:48.647
<i>Most notably, that his mother had
left him and his father for California</i>

25:48.747 --> 25:53.316
<i>at the beginning of the summer and had
kept in touch mainly through Facebook.</i>

25:53.818 --> 25:55.785
<i>But he resisted.</i>

25:56.305 --> 25:59.025
<i>While he knew, cosmically,
that nothing mattered,</i>

25:59.125 --> 26:03.294
<i>he also realized that something
about talking to Brandy did matter,</i>

26:03.394 --> 26:07.163
<i>at least to him. And this was enough.</i>

27:01.687 --> 27:05.191
So, what do you think the chances
are of Timmy coming back out?

27:05.691 --> 27:09.261
Yeah, I don't know. His heart just
didn't seem to be into it, you know?

27:09.361 --> 27:14.066
I'm hoping it's a phase,
but this divorce has been, you know,

27:14.166 --> 27:15.401
it's been rough on both of us.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.963
I know you have no perspective,
fresh wounds and all,

27:18.063 --> 27:19.972
but right now you can hit anything.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.541
Yeah, well... I'm just not in
the hitting mood, you know.

27:24.241 --> 27:26.175
What a waste.

27:32.417 --> 27:36.155
Red, red, go, white, white!
White, white. Go, red, red!

27:36.255 --> 27:37.923
Red, white.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.689
Cute.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.964
Red, white, white,
all together, let's fight!

27:46.064 --> 27:47.168
Go red, red...

29:22.261 --> 29:24.260
God!

29:25.463 --> 29:27.864
Hope you can make it, ma'am.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.647
Ready? Hut.

29:57.228 --> 29:58.728
Hey!

29:59.064 --> 30:02.001
Hey, you were... you were
pretty awesome out there.

30:02.101 --> 30:05.167
- Thanks.
- You're cute, too.

30:10.541 --> 30:12.575
Shouldn't have been that close.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.283
All right, guys, hey. Here we go.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.716
What I want you to do
is look at this number

30:22.020 --> 30:24.220
and tell me what it means to you.

30:25.956 --> 30:27.059
Yeah, go ahead.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.029
It's the day the terrorists attacked
the World Trade Center?

30:30.129 --> 30:32.705
That's right, Regina.
Other than the attack on Pearl Harbor,

30:32.805 --> 30:35.868
it's the only time a foreign force
attacked anything on U.S. soil.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.620
So what I want you to do is,
I want you to pair off

30:37.770 --> 30:40.473
and you're gonna find someone to
interview that remembers that day.

30:40.573 --> 30:42.675
All right, on Friday,
we're gonna give a presentation

30:42.775 --> 30:45.241
on how that day changed our country.

31:26.534 --> 31:31.390
<i>Allison Doss had developed a crush
on Brandon Lender in seventh grade.</i>

31:31.490 --> 31:35.928
<i>It had been her greatest hope
that he would be her first kiss.</i>

31:36.028 --> 31:38.898
<i>Brandon remained the object
of Allison's affection</i>

31:38.998 --> 31:41.367
<i>despite having once said,
within earshot,</i>

31:41.467 --> 31:44.467
<i>"I'd fuck her if I
could find the hole."</i>

32:18.102 --> 32:20.603
<i>You wanna watch me.</i>

32:23.808 --> 32:26.642
<i>I can tease you right back.</i>

33:16.861 --> 33:18.794
Perky.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.442
No tattoos.

33:36.881 --> 33:39.615
Pussy is...

35:38.136 --> 35:41.773
So, Liz, I'm hoping you
got a chance to implement

35:41.873 --> 35:45.243
some of the Internet safety
protocol we talked about last week.

35:45.730 --> 35:46.646
Yeah.

35:47.246 --> 35:50.382
I think we're doing good.
I think my kids are safe.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.884
So, you have all your
daughter's passwords?

35:54.571 --> 35:57.388
- Hi.
- Sorry to interrupt.

35:57.688 --> 36:01.994
My name's Kent. Is this about
the video games and stuff?

36:02.094 --> 36:04.393
Oh, yeah, have a seat.
Hi, Kent. Welcome.

36:06.397 --> 36:09.368
Donna, why don't you tell us
what brought you here tonight?

36:09.468 --> 36:11.036
Thanks. Well,

36:11.236 --> 36:16.941
my daughter is getting to an age
where she's starting to develop.

36:17.041 --> 36:21.012
And, you know, I was just wondering,

36:21.112 --> 36:26.418
what the laws were about what you
can and can't post on the Internet.

36:26.518 --> 36:30.339
That's an excellent question. Because in
our state, the laws are far more lenient

36:30.439 --> 36:31.991
- than they should be.
- They are?

36:32.091 --> 36:35.394
Yeah. If someone is sending
photos to your daughter...

36:35.494 --> 36:36.924
Well...

36:37.528 --> 36:41.599
Yes, but I'm also actually
wondering about if...

36:41.699 --> 36:44.100
if she were to send her own.

36:45.803 --> 36:48.740
Like, if she were to take
a picture of herself

36:48.840 --> 36:52.511
in a bathing suit or
underwear or, you know...

36:52.611 --> 36:55.644
Oh, I see.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.585
Donna, I know our kids aren't
thinking about their futures.

37:00.685 --> 37:04.153
- Hannah's very driven.
- I bet she is.

37:04.689 --> 37:08.459
Before you go, I want to give you a
pamphlet about the dangers of selfies.

37:08.659 --> 37:12.928
- Great. Thanks, that's helpful.
- Okay.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.431
Okay.

37:19.704 --> 37:24.076
Did you guys know anyone
who was, inside?

37:24.176 --> 37:26.577
Like, in it? Like actually
inside one of the buildings?

37:27.177 --> 37:31.316
- No...
- We had friends who were in New York,

37:31.416 --> 37:33.118
but no one got hurt.

37:33.218 --> 37:36.019
Somehow that didn't
make it any less scary.

37:36.329 --> 37:40.292
How... How did you guys, like, find out
that 9/11 was happening and everything?

37:40.392 --> 37:43.095
Oh, yeah, did you get a text or what?

37:43.195 --> 37:45.797
No. There were no texts.

37:45.897 --> 37:49.234
The reason we got cell phones

37:49.334 --> 37:53.539
was to make sure we could get ahold of
each other in case it ever happened again.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.875
- Yeah, that's when everything changed.
- Yeah.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.643
Okay. Where... Where was I?

37:59.343 --> 38:01.880
You were in your room. Sleeping.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.384
We didn't know if we should wake you.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.986
Yeah, we wanted to hide it
from you as long as possible.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.186
And what were you guys doing?

38:16.026 --> 38:17.693
Honey?

38:18.095 --> 38:20.366
- Want to take this one?
- Yeah, we were,

38:21.166 --> 38:23.198
getting ready for work.

38:24.001 --> 38:27.836
I'm pretty sure that we need some poster
board or something to put this on.

38:29.806 --> 38:34.179
Yeah. But not, like, with the Twin Towers
blowing up or whatever or anything.

38:34.279 --> 38:39.114
No, I don't know, with like some,
police officers or

38:39.517 --> 38:42.751
- firemen.
- Totally patriotic.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.459
I like that one. He's hot.

38:52.363 --> 38:55.498
Gonna have to clear
my history after this.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.437
What kind of things you
got hidden in your history?

38:58.537 --> 39:02.053
Oh, you know, just photos

39:02.153 --> 39:06.775
and things for inspiration.

39:10.048 --> 39:13.115
Shit. I gotta go.

39:14.418 --> 39:17.186
Well, I'll just

39:17.855 --> 39:21.623
- finish this.
- Here.

39:28.199 --> 39:32.935
Bookmark this shit for the
next time you need inspiration.

39:39.043 --> 39:43.081
And, Kent? You said
something about video games?

39:43.754 --> 39:47.085
Yeah, my son's pretty into them.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.643
They're very dangerous.

39:48.743 --> 39:51.590
It doesn't matter what you read,
how many studies claim that they're harmless,

39:51.690 --> 39:53.825
I can show you better studies
that claim the contrary.

39:53.925 --> 39:57.626
Well, he's on the computer a lot.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.831
<i>Guild Wars,</i> I think?

39:59.931 --> 40:03.619
That's one of the worst ones. A couple
in China played <i>Guild Wars</i> so much

40:03.719 --> 40:06.381
they neglected their baby
and it died of dehydration.

40:09.006 --> 40:12.378
I'm sure that's, an extreme example, no?

40:12.778 --> 40:14.446
I can show you how to
uninstall the game.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.749
You know, I was really just looking to
see if you knew what the game was like.

40:17.849 --> 40:21.786
I do know what it's like, Kent.
It's a virtual world.

40:21.886 --> 40:26.391
Your son has created an avatar of himself.
An avatar is an icon...

40:26.491 --> 40:28.557
- ...or a representation...
- I saw the movie, yeah.

40:29.493 --> 40:33.061
Well, then you know that an avatar
is often demonic or evil-looking.

40:33.831 --> 40:36.268
When he's plugged in, your son

40:36.368 --> 40:40.336
thinks that that world, the world
of <i>Guild Wars,</i> is the real world.

40:41.005 --> 40:45.543
Our world doesn't matter anymore.
His friends don't matter.

40:45.643 --> 40:49.645
School doesn't matter. You don't matter.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.252
"All I know is, you don't matter, Kent."

40:53.352 --> 40:55.020
- I don't matter!
- "You don't matter."

40:55.120 --> 40:58.624
"Your truck doesn't matter.
Your son doesn't matter!

40:58.724 --> 41:02.222
"And that is why I have installed
a camera in my daughter's brain

41:02.322 --> 41:04.930
"and a seven-digit PIN
code on her vagina.

41:05.030 --> 41:08.030
"And if you'd like,
I can show you all how to do it."

41:12.636 --> 41:14.236
Hey...

41:15.138 --> 41:16.672
Do...

41:17.475 --> 41:21.711
Do you want to go out to dinner
or something or... or drinks?

41:23.213 --> 41:24.847
Or coffee?

41:26.383 --> 41:27.818
Or what?

41:28.018 --> 41:31.654
I think I went through everything
you could do on a first date.

41:32.556 --> 41:33.991
A date.

41:34.191 --> 41:36.427
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

41:36.527 --> 41:38.294
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:29.807 --> 43:31.342
Hey, buddy.

43:31.542 --> 43:33.708
- How's it going?
- Hey, Dad.

43:36.431 --> 43:39.983
- Did you have a good night?
- Yeah, we just did a dungeon.

43:41.486 --> 43:44.254
- Did you win?
- Yeah.

43:44.654 --> 43:45.688
All right, well...

43:47.324 --> 43:49.259
Don't stay up too late, okay?

43:49.659 --> 43:52.260
- Okay.
- All right.

44:13.884 --> 44:15.484
It's weird?

44:16.086 --> 44:19.156
How long ago that all seems?

44:23.927 --> 44:26.528
Yeah, a school report.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.231
How old are we?

44:41.445 --> 44:43.311
I love you.

44:46.416 --> 44:48.250
I love you.

44:50.387 --> 44:52.991
You remember what we were
doing that morning, right?

44:53.091 --> 44:54.990
Yeah.

45:02.732 --> 45:04.399
Come on.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.154
Do you ever get nervous?

45:59.689 --> 46:01.623
About what?

46:04.894 --> 46:07.766
- No.
- I just think 'cause...

46:07.866 --> 46:10.798
How come you didn't respond my message?

46:11.034 --> 46:12.801
What message?

46:13.604 --> 46:16.404
I wrote you on Facebook, like...

46:16.874 --> 46:19.074
Listen, you don't...
you can be honest with me.

46:20.177 --> 46:24.213
- Are you sure it was me?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

46:28.852 --> 46:31.653
- Fuck.
- What?

46:32.622 --> 46:35.939
My mom. She checks my Facebook,

46:36.039 --> 46:39.761
my emails, my texts. She must have
just deleted it before I even saw it.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.364
Isn't that, like,
against the law or something?

46:44.935 --> 46:47.602
No, she thinks she's protecting me.

46:49.606 --> 46:52.173
Is she watching us right now?

46:53.044 --> 46:56.252
No. She just tracks me online.

46:57.381 --> 46:59.014
Seems a little psycho.

47:06.356 --> 47:08.389
I have a secret.

47:09.192 --> 47:11.459
A Tumblr account.

47:11.828 --> 47:13.795
And it's, like,

47:14.064 --> 47:18.266
the only place I can go to
where I can just be myself.

47:19.236 --> 47:22.506
It's not even really me.
Sometimes I just...

47:22.606 --> 47:25.275
cut and paste stuff from other sites or

47:25.375 --> 47:28.377
write something just to see what
it feels like to type the words.

47:31.114 --> 47:32.948
How does it make you feel?

47:34.051 --> 47:36.151
At first,

47:36.887 --> 47:39.887
it's kind of like I'm wearing a costume.

47:41.958 --> 47:43.825
And then,

47:44.494 --> 47:46.694
after long enough,

47:48.632 --> 47:50.033
I...

47:50.133 --> 47:52.634
I just forget that it's not me.

47:59.809 --> 48:01.376
Here.

48:10.587 --> 48:14.392
Nobody knows about it. Not even my mom.

48:15.392 --> 48:18.026
So if you get a message from
that account, you know it's me.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.430
My mom ran off to California

48:23.266 --> 48:26.267
with this douchebag named Greg Cherry.

48:29.673 --> 48:31.606
They just got engaged.

48:38.148 --> 48:40.481
She hasn't told my dad.

48:44.554 --> 48:45.887
It's fucked.

48:47.490 --> 48:49.424
Well,

48:51.161 --> 48:52.661
I'm sorry.

49:26.363 --> 49:29.697
- Hey, ladies.
- Oh, my God. Fuck off.

49:39.309 --> 49:41.645
I didn't know your brother was
friends with Brandon Lender.

49:41.745 --> 49:43.915
Oh, yeah. I guess.

49:44.015 --> 49:46.610
I mean, they're both starters on
the varsity squad or something, so,

49:46.710 --> 49:49.158
I don't know. He's a big
old bitch, if you ask me.

49:49.258 --> 49:51.673
- Your brother or Brandon?
- Oh, they're both bitches.

49:51.773 --> 49:54.091
Yeah. Wasn't Brandon a
total dick to you last year?

49:54.591 --> 49:57.462
That was last year.
I mean, we were freshmen.

49:57.562 --> 49:59.728
And now you're smokin'.
He done fucked up.

49:59.828 --> 50:03.167
Oh, my God, who cares! Let's just
watch <i>Breaking Amish.</i> Please?

50:03.367 --> 50:04.536
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

50:04.936 --> 50:07.271
Okay, we literally watch that
every time we come over.

50:07.371 --> 50:10.675
Yeah, Brooke, we're gonna keep watching
it till my DVR wears out and dies.

50:10.775 --> 50:13.541
I don't even know why they
make other TV shows anymore.

50:31.961 --> 50:36.161
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's everybody else?

50:36.561 --> 50:40.668
They went to the store.
They needed <i>mas</i> beverages.

50:48.279 --> 50:50.678
You can sit down if you want.

50:55.486 --> 51:00.288
So, you must've went on, like, a <i>Biggest
Loser</i> diet or some shit over summer?

51:00.924 --> 51:02.794
Just kind of started
watching what I ate.

51:02.894 --> 51:07.495
Yeah? Well, it shows.
You're, like, a serious piece.

51:08.031 --> 51:12.133
- Have you hooked up with anyone yet?
- Yeah, a little.

51:12.369 --> 51:15.703
Yeah? Totally could now.

51:15.805 --> 51:18.473
Cool. Thanks.

51:44.801 --> 51:46.470
Wait...

51:46.570 --> 51:48.503
should we...

51:49.639 --> 51:50.921
- like...
- Oh, yeah.

51:51.021 --> 51:53.238
So, the first time,

51:53.338 --> 51:56.960
it's gonna hurt a little bit, but...
it's just something you kinda have to do

51:57.060 --> 51:59.114
to get it over with.
You know what I'm saying?

52:00.150 --> 52:01.702
Right.

52:02.752 --> 52:05.023
Maybe we should just, like, you know...

52:05.123 --> 52:09.594
Okay, look. We can stop if you want,
but eventually you're gonna have to do it.

52:09.694 --> 52:13.628
But I'm not like a rapist
or some shit, so...

52:20.470 --> 52:21.637
Okay.

52:23.206 --> 52:25.442
No, no, it's okay.

52:25.542 --> 52:27.708
Okay. Yeah.

54:02.005 --> 54:05.977
I'm gonna head out and see
my sister this afternoon.

54:06.120 --> 54:07.906
You know how she gets
with all her complaining,

54:08.006 --> 54:11.905
she'll probably want to talk my ear
off until we're both drunk on red wine

54:12.005 --> 54:16.717
and pass out. So I think I'll
just end up staying the night.

54:18.021 --> 54:21.623
- Just want to give you a heads up.
- Okay.

54:24.961 --> 54:26.928
Maybe...

54:28.565 --> 54:30.028
I'll call Kent,

54:30.128 --> 54:32.534
- go out for some beers tonight.
- Yeah.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.904
You haven't done that in a while.
I'm sure he could use the company.

54:38.374 --> 54:39.748
Good idea.

55:20.550 --> 55:24.352
Yeah, I should be able to get something
like that together for you immediately.

55:25.388 --> 55:27.188
Thank you.

55:27.624 --> 55:28.992
Okay.

55:29.092 --> 55:32.697
- Okay, thank you. Talk soon.
- I'm gonna be on TV!

55:32.797 --> 55:35.699
First they need a video of you
doing some acting, cheerleading,

55:35.799 --> 55:38.065
stuff around the house...

55:38.301 --> 55:42.136
- Mom, this is it.
- Well, honey, it's a next step.

55:43.106 --> 55:47.747
<i>Despite days of trying, Chris Truby
struggled to become fully aroused</i>

55:47.848 --> 55:51.145
<i>while navigating Hannah Clint's website.</i>

55:52.682 --> 55:55.820
<i>He couldn't imagine suggesting
the kinds of explicit fantasies</i>

55:55.920 --> 55:58.122
<i>he had witnessed online to her,</i>

55:58.222 --> 56:01.122
<i>and feared he had come to rely on them.</i>

56:04.794 --> 56:09.233
<i>In an effort to fix what should come

56:09.333 --> 56:13.400
<i>Chris employed a technique designed

56:13.500 --> 56:15.770
<i>with traditional intercourse.</i>

56:16.673 --> 56:20.376
So, I was gonna go to Lauren's
house to watch a movie.

56:20.576 --> 56:21.978
Now?

56:22.078 --> 56:23.881
- Yeah.
- It's late.

56:23.981 --> 56:28.084
- Well, how're you gonna get there?
- I was just gonna take my bike.

56:28.184 --> 56:31.929
- No, I'll take you.
- You seem like you're doing important work.

56:32.029 --> 56:35.090
I don't wanna distract you
or anything. I can just go.

56:38.428 --> 56:40.428
Okay.

56:43.032 --> 56:44.899
Okay.

56:46.002 --> 56:47.569
But take your phone, honey.

56:50.139 --> 56:52.507
So I can track you.

56:55.211 --> 56:57.078
Got it.

57:20.335 --> 57:21.802
Okay.

58:23.799 --> 58:25.000
Angelique?

58:29.572 --> 58:31.438
Angelique?

58:34.577 --> 58:37.981
- Are you "BoredWife"?
- Yeah.

58:38.081 --> 58:40.514
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:41.450 --> 58:43.218
"SecretLuvur"?

58:45.890 --> 58:48.422
- Oh, God.
- At your service.

58:48.891 --> 58:50.070
You must be Don.

58:50.170 --> 58:52.641
- Hi.
- You're cute.

58:53.362 --> 58:55.196
Thank you.

58:57.200 --> 59:01.230
- Do you want to sit, Don?
- Okay. Sure.

59:09.813 --> 59:13.180
I don't really know how this
is all supposed to go down.

59:14.050 --> 59:18.821
Well, we can finish our drinks
and then we can go on our date.

59:18.921 --> 59:19.988
I'll have a cosmo.

59:20.623 --> 59:23.458
- Excuse me. The lady would like a cosmo.
- I heard her.

59:24.794 --> 59:28.095
- So much for incognito.
- Yeah, right?

59:29.165 --> 59:31.199
Have you never done this before?

59:32.502 --> 59:34.437
No, I don't do this kind of thing.

59:34.637 --> 59:37.244
No, no, no.

59:38.507 --> 59:40.007
I...

59:40.844 --> 59:43.947
I mean, is this what we're...
Is this okay?

59:44.047 --> 59:46.013
Oh, you're more than okay.

59:46.583 --> 59:49.552
I know you said that on the phone,
but a lot of guys just say that.

59:49.652 --> 59:52.754
Why? Why would they do that?

59:53.806 --> 59:55.790
They think it makes me feel special.

59:56.693 --> 01:00:00.628
That's just so weird.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:03.107
I don't know. I mean,
maybe this is just too crazy.

01:00:03.207 --> 01:00:04.966
No, no, no, look, look.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:10.211
I don't want you to think that
you have to do anything tonight.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.841
There are no rules
to this kind of thing.

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:18.412
But you seem really nice.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.952
And you're fine as hell.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.493
It is, isn't it? It's your first time.

01:00:35.097 --> 01:00:36.864
Isn't it obvious?

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.603
- You want to go upstairs?
- Thank you.

01:01:18.774 --> 01:01:19.781
So...

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:22.945
you're a photographer?

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:28.885
I see you... taking photos
at the games and stuff.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.592
No, it's just a hobby. We use the
photos on Hannah's acting website.

01:01:36.892 --> 01:01:40.081
Well, she's lucky she has a...

01:01:40.181 --> 01:01:42.730
a mother who's, you know,
"in the business."

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:48.072
Tell me about it. I got my first
headshots by this guy up in Garland.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:49.974
- Yeah.
- What a creep.

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:52.943
Told me not to forget my
swimsuit and aerobics outfit.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.809
I hope you told him to fuck off.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:02:00.381
I wish. I was 18. I didn't know.

01:02:01.283 --> 01:02:02.752
I hate those photos.

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:05.689
Well, at least, you know,

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:08.496
Hannah has someone to keep
her out of trouble, right?

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:14.028
Yeah. I suppose.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.368
She's actually up for this reality show.

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:22.138
Yeah. It's kind of a talent search.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.371
- Could be fun.
- Yeah.

01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:27.307
It's in Hollywood, so if she gets it

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:29.881
maybe she'll meet her father.

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:36.853
He was this producer that I met
when I went out there to be a star.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:40.123
Oh, yeah, got it.

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:42.926
I came back five months pregnant
with this Mercedes that he bought me

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:45.292
and a monthly child support check.

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:48.696
To be fair, he never missed a
payment on either of them.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.599
Hollywood's loss, I guess.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:57.406
- Isn't that where Lydia moved?
- Yeah, she's...

01:02:57.506 --> 01:02:59.974
going out with some,

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.743
guy named Greg Cherry.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:07.017
Really, I mean "Greg Cherry"?
What kind of name is that, you know?

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:10.417
- It's a pretty lame one.
- It is.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.720
So when did you start thinking
differently about her?

01:03:15.157 --> 01:03:16.857
Honestly?

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:20.127
I know this is gonna...

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:24.098
sound like a pickup line
or something, but...

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.235
meeting you was kind
of a big deal for me.

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:34.174
I mean, you know, for the past year

01:03:35.277 --> 01:03:38.645
pretty much every night I'd just...

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:42.249
go to bed and watch TV and...

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.886
wonder what she was doing.

01:03:47.603 --> 01:03:50.057
But for the past week,

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:54.661
I go to bed and wonder
what you're doing.

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.203
I'm sorry. That was way
too much, wasn't it?

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:02.103
No.

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.438
It was actually pretty great.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.815
I've slept with guys for less.

01:04:11.713 --> 01:04:12.913
Sorry.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:16.186
Do you wanna hear about what
I do for a living or something?

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.619
Yeah, you can tell me if you want to.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:22.826
I'm an account services
manager at Stanley.

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:26.762
And what does an account
services manager do?

01:04:27.062 --> 01:04:29.163
I coordinate

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:33.839
daily service sales activities and

01:04:33.939 --> 01:04:36.904
regarding distributors.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.714
I also,

01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:44.447
manage relationships with
various accounts and...

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:50.450
and... I occasionally assist with
marketing programs relating to

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:52.620
distributors.

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:57.124
- It sounds really complicated.
- Nah, it isn't.

01:05:04.566 --> 01:05:08.272
Oh, wow. You have such a huge dick!

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:11.441
<i>Don presumed his penis
to be of an average size.</i>

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.944
<i>If his dick had, in fact, been huge,</i>

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:17.411
<i>he would probably have
heard about it by this point.</i>

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:27.688
You like that?

01:05:28.741 --> 01:05:30.691
Do you?

01:05:32.761 --> 01:05:34.395
Yeah.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:37.923
What's the matter?

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.168
You scared, little girl?

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.670
A little.

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.207
No.

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.010
I'm excited.

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:57.584
- I want it.
- Where do you want it?

01:05:59.001 --> 01:06:00.789
In my mouth.

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:04.191
Maybe half of it?

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.960
No.

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:09.229
I want it all.

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:15.269
I want...

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:19.108
I want that big penis of yours.

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:22.978
- That's right.
- I want it. I want your dick.

01:06:23.078 --> 01:06:25.045
Oh, attagirl.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:30.419
I want you to destroy me
with your big fucking cock.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:33.387
Oh, fuck, yeah.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:42.731
- You still in here?
- Yes, I am.

01:06:42.831 --> 01:06:45.402
- You've been at it for hours.
- I know.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.803
I can't find anything. We're lucky.

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:53.674
Then maybe you should take
it easy on her for a while.

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:56.914
Maybe I'll just call her and make sure
everything's okay at Lauren's, and then...

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:59.556
You just checked her
entire computer, right?

01:06:59.656 --> 01:07:03.370
Doing whatever it is you do,
checking her email or MySpace.

01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:06.687
You said yourself she's
clean as a whistle.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:09.456
Just let her be a teenager tonight.

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:55.569
That was cool.

01:07:56.538 --> 01:07:58.172
Yeah.

01:08:33.841 --> 01:08:37.144
- Was that okay?
- Yeah, you were great.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:40.183
So, you still have a little
over half an hour left

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.716
if you want to take a break, go again...

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.388
You think maybe we could just

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:54.294
lie in the bed together and maybe you
put your head on my chest or something?

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.962
Yeah, that's fine.

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:13.647
Damn, baby, that was something.

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:39.272
Call me tomorrow.

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:52.654
- Hey.
- She never called.

01:09:52.754 --> 01:09:54.099
What?

01:09:54.198 --> 01:09:57.021
That's weird. Maybe there's
something wrong with my phone.

01:09:57.121 --> 01:09:58.796
I should call my mom,
make sure she's okay.

01:09:58.896 --> 01:10:01.929
Relax. Maybe she's having sex
or something with your dad.

01:10:48.145 --> 01:10:51.980
<i>As a reminder, next weekend
is our arch-rival, Irving.</i>

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.518
<i>We want a sea of red and blue when
we go up against the Aardvarks.</i>

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:58.087
<i>Go, Olympians!</i>

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:02.122
Go, Olympians!

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.358
Dumb bitch.

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:07.996
- What was that?
- I said we lost because of you, fag.

01:11:08.096 --> 01:11:10.667
How could you have lost because
of me if I wasn't even there?

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:14.871
That's why it's your fault, you fuckface.
We could lose district.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:19.105
- Who cares?
- Everybody cares. Everybody!

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.341
All right, yeah, whatever.

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:44.165
Fucker! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.947
So what do you want to know?

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.017
What do you want to tell me?

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.156
What's important in your life right now?

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.927
I don't...

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.266
My dad wants me to play football.

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:19.400
How do you feel about football?

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:24.771
I don't know, it just seems
kind of pointless to me.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:29.910
Okay. What are some of the
things that aren't pointless?

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.515
I don't know. I play <i>Guild Wars.</i>

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:38.218
Is that a Nintendo game?

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:41.157
No, it's an MMORPG.

01:12:41.257 --> 01:12:45.127
It's a role-playing game online.
You play with millions of other players.

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:49.097
And you're probably pretty
good at this game, right?

01:12:49.197 --> 01:12:51.398
Yeah, I guess. I mean,

01:12:51.498 --> 01:12:55.004
it's not really about skill. It's more
about how much time you put into it.

01:12:56.373 --> 01:13:00.374
And the people you play this with,
they're your friends from school?

01:13:01.576 --> 01:13:03.645
Oh, no. No.

01:13:03.745 --> 01:13:06.983
They're just my friends from the game.
Like, I've never actually met them in R.L.

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:08.983
R.L.?

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:12.752
R.L.? In real life.

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:16.557
Do you have friends in R.L.?

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.531
No. I used to have a lot,

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:24.865
but once I stopped playing football
I sort of lost most of them.

01:13:30.138 --> 01:13:31.272
There's a girl, though.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.508
Oh, nice.

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.844
Is she in R.L.?

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:39.813
Yeah.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.316
She's pretty cool.

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:48.189
Have you seen <i>Pale Blue Dot?</i>

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:51.460
Is that a movie or a video game?

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.820
No, it's... It's this thing,
it's this YouTube video.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:01.601
I mean, it basically challenges our
existence and whether or not we matter.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.907
Do you believe anything matters?

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:15.847
On a grand scale?

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:22.355
I think if I disappeared tomorrow,

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.060
the universe wouldn't really notice.

01:14:56.774 --> 01:14:57.624
What?

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.360
Can I show you something?

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:05.198
Yeah, well, I'm kind of busy.
Just send me a pic.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.500
- What's up?
- I only have a minute,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.451
but I just wanted to make sure you weren't
chained up in the basement or something.

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:01.688
And this.

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:43.624
Hey, baby.

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:50.800
- What happened?
- We don't know, baby.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.469
The doctor said someone found
you at school. You were bleeding.

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:54.935
- Hi.
- I feel fine.

01:17:55.035 --> 01:17:58.571
I'm Doctor Stern.
How are you feeling, Allison?

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:02.442
Okay, I guess. Am I, like, okay, though?

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.748
Short answer is yes. Long answer is,
it's a little more complicated.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:08.050
- Okay, what does that even mean?
- Let him talk.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.727
It means I need to tell you a few things
that might seem a little shocking.

01:18:11.827 --> 01:18:14.223
But just keep in mind your
daughter's gonna be fine.

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.553
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:18:16.653 --> 01:18:19.178
Allison, you had what's
called an ectopic pregnancy

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:21.998
- and it spontaneously aborted.
- What?

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:24.133
- What? You were pregnant?
- How can that even happen?

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:26.269
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- Don't "Daddy" me!

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:29.636
The most important thing to
remember is your daughter's okay.

01:18:30.538 --> 01:18:34.043
There was a fertilized egg growing
in one of Allison's fallopian tubes.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:37.544
This can be quite dangerous, especially
if it ruptures. It can be life-threatening.

01:18:38.627 --> 01:18:41.814
You're actually lucky
that it ended on its own.

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.850
You seem to be malnourished,
and I believe that's why

01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:48.355
your body wasn't able
to handle the pregnancy.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.095
Can I go home?

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:55.395
Yeah, but I'd like to keep you
overnight for observation.

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:59.002
We're gonna keep you on some fluids
for hydration and keep you monitored.

01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:02.368
If you all need anything,
please have a nurse page me.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.776
Are you angry with me?

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.654
I can't believe...

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:23.560
I just...

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:29.262
I need a little air.

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:45.044
<i>I'm Hannah Clint and I'm all
about keepin' it cooking.</i>

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.917
<i>And I'm all about cheering.</i>

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:49.986
- This is pretty great.
- Yeah...

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:53.022
It's still too long though, so I was thinking
maybe we could cut some of the dancing

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:57.025
- since it's similar to the cheering.
- No. No, the dance is important.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:20:00.762
Okay, I'll just make some
cuts here and there then.

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:02.695
Cool.

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:07.035
You are actually pretty good at this.

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:10.500
Maybe I can take you with me one day.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.573
You could be my personal editor.

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:18.313
Wait, my parents are still up.

01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:20.580
We can be quiet.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.053
One sec.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.583
Do you want me to help?

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:00.553
No. One sec.

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:27.981
- That's good.
- Okay.

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:40.095
Do... Do you want me...

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.328
One sec.

01:21:46.518 --> 01:21:48.904
Are you gonna move or I...

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.770
Yeah.

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:56.409
Don't you have to, like, have sex?

01:22:02.075 --> 01:22:04.751
- I'll move then.
- No, wait.

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.355
Put it back in.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.624
Fuck...

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:26.005
Is there something I'm doing wrong?

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:32.445
No. I don't know.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:42.154
I'm sorry.

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:52.298
I guess I should text my mom then.

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:32.606
Lucky fucker! How are those titties?
Did you get your dick between them?

01:23:33.841 --> 01:23:37.212
- No.
- Dude. What a waste.

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:39.015
Jesus, dude, when were
you gonna tell me?

01:23:39.615 --> 01:23:42.850
Well, you know, I was trying
to keep it on the D.L.

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:46.919
You can show me photos of trannies but
you can't tell me you nailed Hannah Clint?

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.835
Hey.

01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:05.094
Hey.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.862
So, like, what's the deal?

01:24:11.979 --> 01:24:13.279
What do you mean?

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.986
I mean, we haven't even talked
since last night and now you're, like,

01:24:17.086 --> 01:24:19.786
going around spreading a
rumor that we had sex?

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:23.900
I'm pretty sure we did have sex,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.629
and I might have told
some of my friends.

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:30.999
- So I guess, you know, that's the deal.
- I really don't think that was sex.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.219
Would you rather I tell
everyone that you couldn't?

01:24:33.319 --> 01:24:36.969
No! I don't know why you're
saying anything to anyone.

01:24:39.975 --> 01:24:42.703
Because I thought that
you were my best shot.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:47.850
So I just told everyone
that I lost it, and they...

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:52.017
They think that I lost it,
then I pretty much did, right?

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.055
That is so screwed up.

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.991
Whatever.

01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:07.500
Okay, so I mean, like, what's the deal?

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:12.004
- What do you mean?
- With us. Like, what's the deal with us?

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:15.508
There is no deal.

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.981
Okay? I'm pretty sure you're, like,

01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:22.151
a weird guy who has some
serious sexual issues

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:25.453
and I'm just not into dealing with it.

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.879
I mean, I don't...

01:25:27.759 --> 01:25:32.625
I don't know, we can talk if you want,
but I don't really see the point.

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:42.168
Whatever.

01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:45.004
I know.

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:12.591
Hey, come on. <i>Top Chef</i> is coming up.

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:32.448
Hey, I'm gonna head out to
my sister's again tonight.

01:27:32.548 --> 01:27:34.247
You good to fend for
yourself dinnerwise?

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:39.052
You've been going up there a lot lately.
Is... is everything okay?

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:43.689
Yeah. Yeah... You know, she's...

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:45.994
She's just got a lot on
her plate, you know,

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:50.999
with work and... I don't know,
I think she just needs her sister's ear.

01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:54.634
Of course. You want
me to give you a ride?

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:59.372
Oh, no, you don't...
You don't need to do that. We...

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:05.506
Just go out with your friends.
Go have fun! I want you to be happy.

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:15.769
- Oh, my gosh! How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:28:15.869 --> 01:28:18.026
- You okay? How you feeling?
- I'm fine. Really.

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.730
- What happened?
- Nothing. It was stupid, really.

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:23.196
- But you're fine?
- Yeah.

01:28:24.933 --> 01:28:28.067
- I was so worried about you.
- Oh, you don't need to be.

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:03.336
Los Angeles.

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:05.975
Hello.

01:29:06.075 --> 01:29:08.728
<i>Hi, this is Wendy Gruding from</i>
America's Next Big Celebrity.

01:29:08.828 --> 01:29:11.814
<i>- I'm looking for Donna?</i>
- Speaking.

01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:14.566
<i>Hi, Miss Clint, I'm just calling to
inform you that unfortunately</i>

01:29:14.666 --> 01:29:18.584
<i>we're unable to invite your daughter,
Hannah, to Los Angeles.</i>

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:22.788
Oh, no.

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:28.896
Is there anything...
Hannah was... was...

01:29:28.996 --> 01:29:31.467
If you could just meet her,
I know that I could probably...

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:35.304
<i>Hannah's audition was really terrific.
Frankly, it was one of our best.</i>

01:29:35.404 --> 01:29:38.837
<i>But our clearances came
across a modeling website.</i>

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:41.377
Yeah. Yes...

01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:43.882
Yeah, I think that we...

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:47.421
Yeah, we were putting up
some of Hannah's acting

01:29:47.521 --> 01:29:50.719
and her headshots just to show
her versatility, which... which...

01:29:50.819 --> 01:29:54.219
<i>Are you familiar with
the content of her site?</i>

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:58.837
Well, I mean, some of the photos
are a bit... These kids these days,

01:29:58.937 --> 01:30:02.531
it's... it's not the same from
when you and I were that age!

01:30:02.631 --> 01:30:05.150
<i>Our producers found that the
materials on your daughter's site,</i>

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:09.270
<i>the photos might be deemed by
our network as unwholesome.</i>

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:11.790
Was there a particular photo?
Because it'd be very...

01:30:11.890 --> 01:30:14.543
<i>We answer to our advertisers
and they're very risk-averse.</i>

01:30:14.643 --> 01:30:17.680
<i>Anything that could possibly
be thought of as unseemly...</i>

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:20.182
But we could take down the site.
It'd be so simple.

01:30:20.282 --> 01:30:22.368
<i>We live in a time when there
is simply no such thing.</i>

01:30:22.468 --> 01:30:26.152
<i>- All it takes is one download.</i>
- Why would anyone download...

01:30:26.252 --> 01:30:28.624
<i>We really wish you and your
daughter the very best of luck.</i>

01:30:28.724 --> 01:30:31.949
But, you know, kids are
emailing photos and texting.

01:30:32.049 --> 01:30:36.361
- And it's hardly unique, I have to say...
<i>- It's unique to sell them.</i>

01:30:40.634 --> 01:30:42.303
Wha...

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:45.875
I don't know what you're...
But I mean, we never...

01:30:45.975 --> 01:30:49.208
- I would never...
<i>- We wish you the best of luck.</i>

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.331
Okay.

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.017
Thank you.

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:48.737
- Did I do something?
- No, no, no.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:50.871
No, I don't know what to...

01:31:50.971 --> 01:31:54.042
Can I get you... I haven't done
this for a while, so if I...

01:31:54.142 --> 01:31:56.350
If you know, listen, there's some
protocol that I'm supposed to follow...

01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:58.369
No, it's about Hannah.

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:03.659
It was just supposed to be a place for

01:32:03.759 --> 01:32:07.237
photos and her resume...

01:32:07.337 --> 01:32:09.963
- ...and clips from plays.
- What are you talking about?

01:32:10.063 --> 01:32:12.159
Her website.

01:32:13.395 --> 01:32:17.296
And then one day I got a
message from a stranger.

01:32:17.432 --> 01:32:22.835
A fan of Hannah who wanted
to pay for a modeling session.

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:32.577
I knew it wasn't normal,
but the photos were...

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:37.649
I mean, they... It was the
same thing as catalogue work.

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:40.586
So...

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:45.158
I added a tab to the bottom of the
website that said "Private Photo Shoots."

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:50.732
- Jesus!
- I never let her read any of the emails.

01:32:50.832 --> 01:32:54.267
But the acting classes and,
you know, it's...

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:59.938
I took photos of my daughter.

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.876
And they were meant...

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:09.681
I don't know how we got there, but...

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:17.556
I just had to tell you that.

01:33:19.706 --> 01:33:21.293
Why?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.729
Because I thought if I never...

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:29.301
If I never talked about it,
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:38.243
Donna, you're the first
woman that I've...

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:41.947
You know, since my wife left me.

01:33:45.246 --> 01:33:47.653
Maybe we should just...

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.456
Slow things down.

01:34:38.106 --> 01:34:39.942
Did you get some good shots?

01:34:40.042 --> 01:34:43.378
Actually, I didn't bring my camera.
I just came to talk to Kent.

01:34:43.478 --> 01:34:46.311
You're so on his jock!

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:49.324
Hey, what is up with that TV show?

01:34:49.424 --> 01:34:52.685
I mean, I'm pretty sure they said
they were gonna let us know by, like,

01:34:52.785 --> 01:34:55.724
the end of the week, and it's
pretty much the end of the week.

01:34:55.824 --> 01:34:58.124
So, I don't know...
What do you think the deal is?

01:35:05.265 --> 01:35:06.787
We didn't get it.

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:12.258
Why? I don't... I mean...

01:35:12.541 --> 01:35:16.712
I don't get it. I mean,
I'm pretty sure I must have been

01:35:16.812 --> 01:35:19.437
one of the best ones. What...

01:35:19.537 --> 01:35:21.734
Did they not like the
video or something?

01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:25.450
Honey, they didn't like our website.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:32.624
Well, then screw them.

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:36.094
I thought about it,

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:38.224
and they're right.

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:44.436
I took down the site.

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.706
You what?

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:51.980
- What about all of my fans?
- If you wanna act, you can act.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.950
We will get you into every
theater program that we can.

01:35:55.050 --> 01:35:57.953
But that show and the website,
that's not what you want to do.

01:35:58.053 --> 01:35:59.855
Yes, it is. Mom, it is!

01:35:59.955 --> 01:36:02.858
- It is everything that I wanna do!
- You're better than that stupid show

01:36:03.058 --> 01:36:04.693
- and you're better than the website.
- No, I'm not!

01:36:04.793 --> 01:36:07.345
- No, you have to put it back up.
- I can't.

01:36:07.445 --> 01:36:10.327
Yes, you can.
Just push a fucking button!

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.105
I've allowed you certain flexibility,
but right now I have to be your mom.

01:36:17.205 --> 01:36:19.138
No, you're being a selfish bitch.

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.479
It's gone!

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:30.782
I deleted it.

01:38:41.008 --> 01:38:42.750
Jameson, rocks.

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:44.883
Oh, God.

01:39:35.035 --> 01:39:38.203
I wouldn't bother.
I changed your passwords.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.473
Why would...

01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:44.296
What is wrong with you?

01:39:45.046 --> 01:39:47.803
You don't seem to understand
how dangerous it is on there.

01:39:47.903 --> 01:39:50.784
The only thing that's dangerous
in this house, Mom, is you!

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:54.319
- I'm protecting you.
- From what, having a normal life?

01:39:58.358 --> 01:39:59.725
Give me your phone.

01:40:01.561 --> 01:40:02.963
No.

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:06.868
You can give me your phone or I
can call and cancel the service

01:40:06.968 --> 01:40:09.468
and remote swipe all the
crap you put on there.

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:17.509
It's not like you haven't
already read all of it, anyway.

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:35.960
What's going on, Dad?

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:44.736
Great group of...
friends you play with there.

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:49.357
Had some real nice things to say
about having sex with your mother.

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:53.615
You don't understand.
They're just jokes, okay.

01:40:53.715 --> 01:40:56.952
Yeah, Selkis... That's how you
pronounce his name? "Silk-eez"?

01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:59.888
Yeah, he prefers to have reverse cowgirl

01:40:59.988 --> 01:41:01.823
so he doesn't have to look
your mother in the face.

01:41:01.923 --> 01:41:04.526
I wasn't supposed to know, okay.
I figured you weren't, either.

01:41:04.626 --> 01:41:06.795
- What the hell's that mean?
- I saw an album on Facebook.

01:41:06.895 --> 01:41:09.541
She posted it, and I caught
it before she blocked me.

01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:11.417
She corrected it, like,
within a few minutes.

01:41:11.517 --> 01:41:15.567
- She wasn't trying to hurt us.
- She didn't want to hurt us?

01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:17.515
She abandoned us!

01:41:18.515 --> 01:41:19.904
She abandoned you.

01:41:20.004 --> 01:41:23.343
Oh, really? She got a bedroom
for you out there in California?

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:28.947
Did you get your wedding invite yet?
She abandoned us!

01:41:29.516 --> 01:41:32.584
Your mom's gone. Yeah, she's gone.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.388
She got bored with
the scenery and split.

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:41.225
So it's just you and me,
and that's how it's gonna be.

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:44.662
Probably forever.

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:47.098
All right, Dad, whatever.

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:53.458
- And you're playing football next year.
- No, I'm not.

01:41:53.558 --> 01:41:54.810
- Oh, yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not!

01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:57.212
I understand you needed
the year to, you know,

01:41:57.312 --> 01:41:59.281
have your space and stuff,
but you belong on that team.

01:41:59.381 --> 01:42:03.059
I don't even fucking like football, Dad.
Okay? I like <i>Guild Wars!</i>

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:05.070
Fuck that stupid game.
It's a waste of time.

01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:08.123
No, that's all it is, is time!
And I've put in months of my life and I...

01:42:08.223 --> 01:42:11.556
- I'm invested now, okay?
- Not anymore, you're not.

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:14.863
- Because I canceled it.
- You mean, you deleted the application?

01:42:14.963 --> 01:42:17.599
- Okay, I'll reinstall it. Thanks, Dad.
- No, you won't.

01:42:17.699 --> 01:42:21.101
I called my credit card company
and told them to delete your account.

01:42:21.201 --> 01:42:22.265
So, it's gone.

01:42:25.171 --> 01:42:26.738
What?

01:42:31.628 --> 01:42:33.407
Why would you do that?

01:42:33.507 --> 01:42:36.465
Because... whether you like it or not,

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:39.651
I'm doing this for your own good.

01:45:39.699 --> 01:45:41.199
Brandy?

01:45:46.372 --> 01:45:47.369
Brandy?

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:42.360
- Where's Tim?
- In his room. Hey!

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:46.534
Tim! Tim!

01:46:46.634 --> 01:46:48.902
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Christ!

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:50.128
- Oh, shit!
- Get a phone!

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:01.372
Hey, Dad.

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.313
I'm so sorry.

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.416
It's okay.

01:48:18.558 --> 01:48:21.192
You're really beautiful, you know that?

01:49:28.528 --> 01:49:30.495
I'd like to explain last night.

01:49:40.647 --> 01:49:42.314
I don't know how we got here.

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:51.415
I just... It's like we slipped,
and before we knew it

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:54.619
the whole reason we started dating or...

01:49:54.921 --> 01:49:57.710
- had a family just...
- What do you want?

01:49:59.459 --> 01:50:03.998
I don't... But I... I don't...

01:50:04.098 --> 01:50:07.965
Cheddar? Swiss? Scallions? Tomatoes?

01:50:08.602 --> 01:50:10.404
I don't know what I was looking for

01:50:10.504 --> 01:50:12.804
- when I went online...
- Chives?

01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.940
I could do turkey bacon.

01:50:17.811 --> 01:50:20.302
I understand you're upset. I just...

01:50:20.402 --> 01:50:23.682
I just want to know what
you'd like in your eggs.

01:50:25.519 --> 01:50:28.486
Don, we need to talk about this.

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:33.024
- I've made mistakes.
- So have I.

01:50:34.861 --> 01:50:36.828
Oh, yeah.

01:50:37.463 --> 01:50:39.363
So have I.

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:44.568
Probably worse than you.

01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:50.642
I don't know, Helen... That's just it.

01:50:51.828 --> 01:50:54.278
What's... What's just it?

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:59.886
Well, we could sit here and tell each
other everything we've ever done.

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:02.786
Shit, everything we've ever thought.

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:05.556
It might take a while.

01:51:07.461 --> 01:51:12.563
But, yeah, we could
clear everything up and

01:51:12.866 --> 01:51:17.702
go to sleep tonight with some
pretty vivid pictures in our heads.

01:51:24.628 --> 01:51:27.811
Or you could just tell me
what you want for breakfast.

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:09.146
