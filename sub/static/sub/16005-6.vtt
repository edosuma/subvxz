02:55.759 --> 02:58.361
So how long ago did you send
the letter to the FDA?

02:58.428 --> 02:59.762
About a month ago.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.931
It detailed
all of the research

03:01.999 --> 03:04.200
that my company,
Hoxton-Moss Pharmaceuticals,

03:04.268 --> 03:06.202
has been covering up
about a cholesterol drug

03:06.270 --> 03:07.770
that they're bringing
to the market.

03:07.838 --> 03:09.872
What did the police
have to say?

03:09.923 --> 03:11.407
Well, they said
they didn't have

03:11.475 --> 03:14.110
enough proof
and that if they did,

03:14.178 --> 03:15.411
prosecution meant
that all of us

03:15.479 --> 03:17.446
<i>are gonna have to go</i>

03:19.416 --> 03:21.117
We'd have to disappear

03:21.185 --> 03:22.685
our whole life,
basically erased.

03:22.753 --> 03:25.254
Mr. Chance,
no one will help us.

03:25.322 --> 03:27.623
<i>We've got nowhere else</i>

03:27.691 --> 03:29.458
Listen, you came
to the right place.

03:29.526 --> 03:31.894
We can help you.
Mr. Winston...

03:31.962 --> 03:33.796

a few questions,

03:33.864 --> 03:35.464

in a minute.

03:38.001 --> 03:39.368
So you wanted to see me?

03:39.419 --> 03:41.754
Yes. And to think
all it took

03:41.839 --> 03:43.372
<i>was two voice mails</i>
<i>and three emails.</i>

03:43.440 --> 03:45.124
<i>Going somewhere?</i>

03:45.209 --> 03:47.093
I leave
for Uganda tonight.

03:47.177 --> 03:48.811
I'll be gone
through the new year.

03:48.879 --> 03:50.880
So if you'd be so kind as
to inform the rest of the team,

03:50.948 --> 03:52.248
I'd be most grateful.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.583
What's in Uganda?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.135
A number
of charitable organizations

03:56.220 --> 03:58.487
funded by
the Pucci Foundation.

03:58.555 --> 04:00.589
They're usually short-staffed
at this time of year,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.558
so I thought
I could be of some use.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.960
New clients?

04:04.027 --> 04:06.362
Oh. Maybe.

04:06.430 --> 04:09.632
So you're just skipping off
to Uganda over Christmas, huh?

04:09.700 --> 04:14.003
Holidays can be tough,
especially if...

04:16.240 --> 04:17.940
If...?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.543
Well, you know, if you've lost
someone close to you.

04:20.611 --> 04:24.013
It's not my favorite time
of year either.

04:27.384 --> 04:29.819
Yes, well, um--well,
I thank you for your concern,

04:29.887 --> 04:32.255
but my trip has nothing to do
with my husband's death.

04:32.322 --> 04:34.290
It has to do with preserving
what he worked on

04:34.358 --> 04:35.291
during his life.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.759
Okay.

you know, just friends.

21:18.314 --> 21:20.215
Okay.

21:30.126 --> 21:33.462
Putting aside the blog
hypothesis for a minute,

21:33.530 --> 21:35.798
earlier this afternoon,
Guerrero found a business card

21:35.865 --> 21:38.100
in Meachem's office with
a Swedish address and number.

21:38.168 --> 21:39.635
Does that mean
anything to you?

21:39.702 --> 21:40.736
Swedish?

21:40.804 --> 21:43.272
Uh, well, look...

21:43.339 --> 21:44.873
The guys who ran us
off the road that night,

21:44.941 --> 21:46.308
they were not speaking
english.

21:46.376 --> 21:48.143
I couldn't place it at the time.
It could have been Swedish.

21:48.211 --> 21:49.645
Aren't the Klaxons
from the down the street

21:49.712 --> 21:51.080
originally from Sweden?

21:51.147 --> 21:53.132
No, no. They're just Canadian.
Oh, that's right.

21:54.751 --> 21:56.251
Yeah, what do you got?

21:56.319 --> 21:57.786
Guerrero.

21:57.837 --> 21:59.488
Yeah, the thugs
that showed up at book club

21:59.556 --> 22:01.473
work for a guy by the name
of Severenson Klemah.

22:01.558 --> 22:03.325
He's a Swedish
game-designer-turned-hacker.

22:03.393 --> 22:06.195
He now specializes in something
called "zombie-bots."

22:06.262 --> 22:08.847
Zombie what?
<i>It's invisible software</i>

22:08.932 --> 22:10.182
buried deep inside
a computer game.

22:10.266 --> 22:12.101
When you play the game, software
takes over your computer

22:12.152 --> 22:13.268
without you realizing it,

22:13.336 --> 22:14.803
kind of making your computer,
you know...

22:14.871 --> 22:16.305
Oh, zombie--
right, clever.

22:16.372 --> 22:17.406
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:17.474 --> 22:19.274
So this guy pays off Meachem

22:19.342 --> 22:21.410
for emails
to Hoxton-Moss employees.

22:21.478 --> 22:22.978
They play the game--bam.

22:23.029 --> 22:25.314
They've got access
to the company server.

22:25.381 --> 22:26.882
<i>That's pretty damn clever.</i>

22:26.950 --> 22:29.051
Yeah. Wish I'd have thought
of it myself.

22:29.119 --> 22:31.453
So anyone in the family
a gamer?

22:45.368 --> 22:47.553
Okay, look,
before you start on me--

22:47.637 --> 22:49.204
where the hell are you?
You have Joel?

22:49.272 --> 22:51.723
Yes, and
everything's fine.

22:51.808 --> 22:53.475
<i>We're just at a house party</i>
<i>down the street--</i>

22:53.543 --> 22:55.210
<i>Ames, Joel is the one</i>
<i>they're after.</i>

22:55.278 --> 22:57.346
<i>Not the father,</i>
<i>not the mother--it's Joel.</i>

22:57.413 --> 22:59.882
Right. Well, uh, that explains
the two professional

22:59.949 --> 23:01.583
mouth breathers
that just walked in.

23:01.651 --> 23:03.085
Look, we're down the street.
Just get here now.

23:03.153 --> 23:04.419
Stay here!

23:04.487 --> 23:07.022
I have Vargas for science
too-- we gotta talk.

23:07.090 --> 23:08.690
<i>Joel?</i>
What are you doing?

23:08.758 --> 23:10.492
We totally were connecting.
Oh, that's awesome, Joel.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.594
Less awesome is the fact
that two thugs just walked in

23:12.662 --> 23:15.063
apparently looking for you.
What?

23:15.131 --> 23:16.899
Friends of yours?

23:21.037 --> 23:22.504
What?
Get out of the way, man!

23:22.572 --> 23:23.839
Hey!

23:30.079 --> 23:32.214
<i>Whoa!</i>

23:32.265 --> 23:34.716
<i>Joel Applebaum's</i>
<i>getting his ass kicked!</i>

23:36.853 --> 23:39.755
<i>Run, Joel, run.</i>

23:41.057 --> 23:44.059
Aah!

23:46.296 --> 23:48.197
<i>Ooh! That's gonna</i>
<i>leave a mark.</i>

23:51.634 --> 23:53.368
Ames, you okay?

24:03.313 --> 24:05.781
<i>Oh, holy Christmas!</i>

24:05.848 --> 24:07.382
Gnarly.

24:07.433 --> 24:10.385
Is that dude
with Joel Applebaum?

24:10.453 --> 24:12.154
Yeah, he is.

24:12.222 --> 24:15.440
Stay off drugs.
I'll be watching.

24:26.888 --> 24:28.622
You call this protection?

24:28.690 --> 24:31.658
In the course of one day,
one single day,

24:31.726 --> 24:33.327
Chance levels me
like a linebacker,

24:33.394 --> 24:36.129
my wife is shot at
and shoved into a closet,

24:36.180 --> 24:37.597
and my son is nearly killed
at a kegger!

24:37.649 --> 24:39.132
We understand
this might seem

24:39.183 --> 24:41.184
a little unorthodox
to you, Mr. Applebaum.

24:41.269 --> 24:42.536
<i>Joel...</i>

24:42.603 --> 24:45.505
You ever play a game
called <i>Zombie Circus?</i>

24:45.573 --> 24:47.841
Um, yeah.

24:47.909 --> 24:50.377
I got an email
offering me

24:50.445 --> 24:53.146
a free 30-day trial
of the game,

24:53.214 --> 24:55.215
and I played it.

24:55.283 --> 24:58.285
And, well, the game
totally sucked.

24:58.353 --> 25:00.821
Even worse, it practically
shredded my hard drive

25:00.888 --> 25:02.622
with some sort of virus.

25:02.690 --> 25:04.324
<i>I-I got angry.</i>

25:04.392 --> 25:08.295
I hacked into the site of
the company that made the game.

25:08.363 --> 25:09.863
I wanted to teach them
a lesson,

25:09.931 --> 25:11.398
so I erased
all their files.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.866
You--what did you do?
Joel!

25:12.934 --> 25:14.234
I know.
I'm sorry.

25:14.302 --> 25:16.053
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

25:16.137 --> 25:18.572
I was just so angry,
and I didn't think that--

25:18.639 --> 25:20.574
that, you know, something
like this would happen.

25:20.641 --> 25:23.243
<i>It seems your little</i>
<i>hacking job effectively erased</i>

25:23.311 --> 25:25.912
all of Klemah's
stolen Hoxton-Moss files,

25:25.980 --> 25:28.448
<i>which we can assume</i>
<i>were very valuable.</i>

25:28.516 --> 25:29.983
But there are still
some copies

25:30.051 --> 25:31.818
of the stolen files
on your laptop.

25:31.869 --> 25:33.870
S-so what--now these guys
want to kill me?

25:40.728 --> 25:43.263
<i>Why are your feet</i>
<i>on my desk?</i>

25:43.331 --> 25:44.898
Who are you?

25:44.966 --> 25:47.734
The janitor.
Have a seat.

25:47.802 --> 25:49.403
Get out of my office.

25:56.077 --> 25:57.978
You, Nick...

25:58.045 --> 25:59.346
<i>Are what we</i>

25:59.414 --> 26:03.016
in the custodial arts
like to call a real douche.

26:03.084 --> 26:05.585
<i>Tell me how I can get in touch</i>
<i>with Severenson Klemah,</i>

26:05.653 --> 26:07.287
who we both know
you're in business with.

26:07.355 --> 26:09.890
<i>My boss wants to talk</i>
<i>to your boss.</i>

26:09.957 --> 26:11.891
You're gonna help.

26:11.943 --> 26:13.794
And I really hate having
to explain myself

26:13.861 --> 26:15.529
to people
in your position, so...

26:15.596 --> 26:18.932
Let's just say,
in this case, uh...

26:19.000 --> 26:21.034
It's gonna involve
this stapler.

26:21.102 --> 26:23.036
I'm calling security.

26:23.104 --> 26:25.005
Aah! Aah! Aah!

26:26.240 --> 26:28.942
<i>Now, how do I contact</i>
<i>Klemah?</i>

26:29.010 --> 26:30.410
<i>Aah!</i>

26:30.478 --> 26:32.379
Crappy office, by the way.

26:36.150 --> 26:37.551
Yes.

26:37.618 --> 26:38.718
<i>We have the laptop.</i>

26:38.770 --> 26:40.253
And who would I be
speaking with?

26:40.321 --> 26:41.855
Oh, that's irrelevant.
What's important

26:41.923 --> 26:43.723
is we're willing to arrange
to give it back to you

26:43.791 --> 26:45.992
in exchange for you leaving
Joel and his family alone.

26:46.060 --> 26:48.562
<i>So where and when would you</i>
<i>like to conduct the exchange?</i>

26:48.613 --> 26:51.615
Well, let's see.
How about...

26:51.699 --> 26:54.701
This afternoon in the mall

26:54.769 --> 26:57.804
where young Joel
sells hot dogs?

26:57.872 --> 27:01.408
<i>A nice public place,</i>
<i>lots of innocent bystanders.</i>

27:01.476 --> 27:03.410
<i>I will send a man,</i>

27:03.478 --> 27:05.512
<i>and you send Joel</i>
<i>with the laptop.</i>

27:05.580 --> 27:06.630
Joel?

27:06.714 --> 27:09.950
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>And if we see</i>

27:10.017 --> 27:11.618
anyone else but him--

27:11.669 --> 27:15.021
you, the police, anyone--

27:15.089 --> 27:16.857
then the whole family dies.

27:16.924 --> 27:20.260
<i>Maybe not right away, hmm?</i>
<i>But eventually.</i>

27:20.328 --> 27:21.761
<i>You can't protect them</i>
<i>forever,</i>

27:21.829 --> 27:25.098
whoever you are.

27:25.166 --> 27:26.867
Do we have a deal?

27:30.972 --> 27:33.373
Yeah.
You got a deal.

27:33.441 --> 27:35.142
Absolutely not.

27:35.209 --> 27:36.443
It's not gonna happen.

27:36.511 --> 27:38.028
At least they agree
on something.

27:38.112 --> 27:39.746
Richard, Rachel,
listen, just hear us out.

27:39.814 --> 27:42.048
We understand your concerns,
but we can protect Joel.

27:42.116 --> 27:43.917
Not sending him means
this thing just continues.

27:43.985 --> 27:45.818
Now, Klemah was right
about one thing.

27:45.870 --> 27:47.154
We can't protect you
forever.

27:47.221 --> 27:48.555
Mr. Chance,

27:48.623 --> 27:51.525
you must realize that Joel's
not like one of you.

27:51.592 --> 27:53.527
He's...

27:53.594 --> 27:55.729
Well, he's practically
afraid of his own shadow.

27:59.567 --> 28:01.635
You mind if I talk
to Joel alone?

28:04.805 --> 28:07.140
All right.

28:09.410 --> 28:11.478
Make sure he don't hack
into anything.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.014
<i>Joel...</i>

28:14.081 --> 28:16.349
Why don't you give the computer
a rest, have a seat?

28:16.417 --> 28:18.718
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

28:25.126 --> 28:27.027
So how you holding up?

28:27.094 --> 28:29.412
Okay, I guess.

28:29.497 --> 28:31.831
I mean, I still can't believe
all this is all my fault.

28:31.899 --> 28:34.234
No, it's not your fault.

28:34.302 --> 28:36.169
But here's the situation.

28:36.237 --> 28:38.138
I spoke with the guy
who wants the computer.

28:38.206 --> 28:40.240
He said he's willing
to call off the dogs

28:40.308 --> 28:42.142
if we give it back to him,
but the condition is

28:42.209 --> 28:44.311
you've got to bring it
to him this afternoon personally

28:44.378 --> 28:47.247
at the mall where you work.
Me?

28:49.450 --> 28:52.385
Jeez, this really is shaping up
to be the worst Christmas ever.

28:52.453 --> 28:54.387
Yeah, well, they're all
equally annoying, if you ask me.

28:54.455 --> 28:56.022
But then again,
I didn't grow up

28:56.073 --> 28:57.724
with the kind
of family you have.

28:57.792 --> 28:59.859
Your parents care about you
a great deal.

28:59.911 --> 29:01.695
So you can imagine
they're not too thrilled

29:01.762 --> 29:04.731
about the idea
of you making the exchange.

29:04.799 --> 29:06.766
But you think I should.

29:06.834 --> 29:09.603
I know we can protect you.

29:09.670 --> 29:13.306
What matters is whether or not
you think you can do it.

29:13.374 --> 29:16.776
If you can't,
don't worry about it.

29:16.844 --> 29:18.878
We'll find another way.

29:24.785 --> 29:27.554
But if you ask me,
in this life,

29:27.622 --> 29:29.055
you get pushed around

29:29.123 --> 29:33.326
just about as long
as you don't push back.

29:35.112 --> 29:36.763
For what it's worth,
if he says he can do this,

29:36.831 --> 29:38.565
I think we can pull it off.

29:38.633 --> 29:41.067
Okay, you're saying this whole
thing rests on Joel's decision.

29:41.135 --> 29:42.319
That is patently absurd.

29:42.403 --> 29:43.570
He is not old enough

29:43.621 --> 29:45.305
to decide something like this
for himself.

29:45.373 --> 29:46.606
He's 16 years old.

29:46.674 --> 29:48.742
I think you're wrong.

29:48.809 --> 29:52.078
Dad, I can do it.

29:52.146 --> 29:54.314
I really think that
I can do it--we can do it.

29:54.382 --> 29:56.816
Yeah, well, it's not open
for discussion, Joel.

29:56.884 --> 29:57.951
<i>Have a seat.</i>

29:58.019 --> 29:59.786
Chance, Winston,
and Ames can protect me.

29:59.854 --> 30:01.988
I trust them to,
and--and you should too.

30:02.056 --> 30:05.258
I mean, what's
the alternative, run forever?

30:05.326 --> 30:06.459
Kid has a point.

30:08.796 --> 30:10.630
Mr. Chance...

30:10.698 --> 30:12.632
Do you have children?

30:12.700 --> 30:13.633
No.

30:13.701 --> 30:16.269
Close family?
No.

30:16.337 --> 30:18.204
All due respect,

30:18.272 --> 30:21.308
I don't think you understand
what you're asking of us.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.343
You know,
maybe you're right.

30:23.411 --> 30:25.779
Maybe I don't have any idea
what it's like to have a family,

30:25.846 --> 30:27.647
but I do know
how to protect one,

30:27.715 --> 30:29.683
better than anyone.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.484
<i>Now, you let Joel do this,</i>
<i>we put these guys away,</i>

30:31.552 --> 30:33.687
and you and your family
get your lives back.

30:33.754 --> 30:35.388
But that is not something

30:35.456 --> 30:38.291
that you can
absolutely promise, is it?

30:38.359 --> 30:41.461
I just did.

30:55.537 --> 30:57.088
All right, Joel
you got any questions?

30:57.178 --> 30:58.612
You feel good
about everything?

30:58.644 --> 31:00.011
I think I'm fine.

31:00.034 --> 31:01.935
Klemah emailed me a picture of
the guy you're gonna be meeting.

31:02.002 --> 31:03.336
He's gonna be sitting
at a table

31:03.387 --> 31:05.171
right in front
of the hot dog stand.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.006
<i>And all Joel is gonna do</i>

31:07.057 --> 31:08.341
is put this laptop
on a table

31:08.392 --> 31:10.376
- and just walk away, right?
- Exactly.

31:10.444 --> 31:12.011
It's okay.
Chance, Winston, and Guerrero

31:12.079 --> 31:13.847
are gonna there be with him
the whole way, okay?

31:13.914 --> 31:15.782
He's gonna have a mic
and a camera on him.

31:15.849 --> 31:17.717
We're gonna be able to hear
and see everything.

31:17.785 --> 31:19.552
<i>Now, Joel, once</i>
<i>you've made the drop</i>

31:19.620 --> 31:20.653
and you're back here safely,

31:20.721 --> 31:22.288
we're gonna follow
the laptop to Klemah.

31:22.356 --> 31:24.290
We'll take him out, by which
time you're gonna be back here

31:24.358 --> 31:26.759
with your dad and Ames.
Okay.

31:26.827 --> 31:28.795
<i>All right? Now I'm gonna</i>
<i>go get into position.</i>

31:28.863 --> 31:30.363
Ames is gonna tell you
when to move. Hey...

31:30.431 --> 31:31.498
You're gonna be great.

31:40.808 --> 31:44.244
Chance...

31:44.311 --> 31:48.214
Uh, I want you
to understand...

31:48.282 --> 31:51.151
He's my son.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.822
He's all we got.

31:55.890 --> 31:59.092
Richard, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to him.

32:15.910 --> 32:18.778
Are you okay,
Mr. Applebaum?

32:18.846 --> 32:20.747
I'm doing my best.

32:20.814 --> 32:22.348
I'm glad I talked Rachel
out of coming.

32:22.416 --> 32:24.617
She couldn't take this.

32:24.685 --> 32:26.452
I can't take it.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.422
Ames, look,
one more time--

32:29.490 --> 32:32.642
explain to me where Chance
and his team are going to be.

32:34.094 --> 32:35.261
Oh, ho ho ho ho.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.530

Okay, Joel,

36:17.808 --> 36:19.108
I talked to Hoxton-Moss.

36:19.176 --> 36:20.543
They said Meachem
was acting alone,

36:20.611 --> 36:22.912
and they're gonna cooperate
with the FDA, so I keep my job.

36:22.979 --> 36:24.731
That's good.
Glad we could be of help.

36:24.763 --> 36:26.181
Winston,
I'm gonna miss you.

Aw...

It was nice having
someone to talk to.

Well, I hope it's gonna be
nicer to talk to me.

36:31.971 --> 36:33.605
I know I haven't been
very easy to live with,

36:33.672 --> 36:35.740

I promise.

you're not gonna see me

36:42.882 --> 36:43.982
Thursday at 4:00?

36:44.049 --> 36:45.550
What's Thursday at 4:00?

36:45.618 --> 36:47.318
Book club.

36:47.386 --> 36:51.089
And that's a lovely tree
you have there, by the way.

36:51.156 --> 36:52.574
Thank you, Winston.

36:56.729 --> 36:57.712

Are you kidding me?

37:38.103 --> 37:40.371
Yeah, it's mistletoe.

37:46.378 --> 37:48.146
Oh. Hold on.

37:49.648 --> 37:52.917
Just give him a second.
He can handle it.

37:52.985 --> 37:55.119

38:02.227 --> 38:03.628

Hey, dudes.

38:24.149 --> 38:26.417
What's up with this?

38:26.485 --> 38:28.620
Winston,
you shouldn't have.

38:28.687 --> 38:30.488
But I did.

38:30.556 --> 38:32.924
Merry Christmas, pal.

38:32.992 --> 38:34.525
Ho ho ho!

38:34.593 --> 38:36.344
Anybody want a scotch?

38:36.428 --> 38:38.329
Stole the bottle
from Meachem's office.

38:38.397 --> 38:40.064
Yeah.
I'll take a double.

38:51.010 --> 38:53.711
You know, I always wondered
what it would be like,

38:53.779 --> 38:56.047
you know,
to grow up in the burbs

38:56.115 --> 38:57.548
with a normal family.

38:57.616 --> 39:00.518
All I know is I'd rather
be tortured by a...

39:00.586 --> 39:01.853
Well, by me

39:01.920 --> 39:03.788
than ever have to go
back there again.

39:03.856 --> 39:05.156
Suburbs blow.

39:05.224 --> 39:06.958
All right,
that's it for me.

39:07.009 --> 39:08.292
I got to go.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.695
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.

39:10.763 --> 39:12.296
I'm exhausted.

39:12.364 --> 39:13.865
See you guys.

39:13.932 --> 39:15.700
Come on.
I'll give you a lift.

39:15.768 --> 39:17.702
I got a meeting
with the plumber.

39:17.770 --> 39:18.836
The plumber?

39:18.904 --> 39:20.338
Yeah, I don't want
to miss him.

39:20.406 --> 39:22.240
It's past midnight.

39:22.307 --> 39:24.976
It's not a plumber--
the plumber.

39:25.044 --> 39:27.945
Just--forget about it, dude.
You don't want to know.

39:42.561 --> 39:43.728
Oh, jeez!

39:43.796 --> 39:46.097
Yeah, I was just checking
the water.

39:49.201 --> 39:50.401
Ilsa.

39:50.469 --> 39:53.004
I thought you were gone
through new year's.

39:53.072 --> 39:54.238
You were right.

39:54.306 --> 39:56.207
About what?

39:57.844 --> 39:59.540
I went away
to throw myself into work,

39:59.640 --> 40:01.341
because I thought
it might help me forget

40:00.446 --> 40:03.748
about Marshall
being gone.

40:05.852 --> 40:06.848
But it didn't.

40:07.886 --> 40:10.254
Well, some things
you can't run away from,

40:10.322 --> 40:12.957
no matter how far
you go.

40:13.025 --> 40:15.026
Are you drinking alone
during the holidays?

40:15.077 --> 40:16.594
Not anymore.

40:20.332 --> 40:21.799
Even before
Marshall's death,

40:21.867 --> 40:24.435
this wasn't
my favorite time of year.

40:24.503 --> 40:26.003
Why not?

40:26.071 --> 40:27.839
Oh, I don't know.

40:27.906 --> 40:32.677
It always seemed a time
saved for normal families.

40:33.946 --> 40:36.280
That wasn't you?

40:36.348 --> 40:39.117
No, it wasn't.

40:40.652 --> 40:41.769
Well...

40:44.456 --> 40:46.224
Well, here's
to abnormal families.

40:52.164 --> 40:54.365
Say...

40:54.433 --> 40:56.167
Ilsa...

40:56.235 --> 40:57.835
Seeing that, you know,

40:57.903 --> 41:01.172
the holidays aren't really
all they're cracked up to be,

41:01.240 --> 41:04.308
what do you say we, uh,
get rid of that tree?

41:04.376 --> 41:06.944
It's more of a Winston thing.
I'm the only one who lives here.

41:07.012 --> 41:08.646
You're the boss.
That's true.

41:10.115 --> 41:12.817
But I quite like
what it represents--

41:12.885 --> 41:16.087
something to aspire to.

41:19.191 --> 41:20.992
The tree stays.

41:25.063 --> 41:26.798
Happy Christmas,
Mr. Chance.

41:26.865 --> 41:29.167
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Pucci.
