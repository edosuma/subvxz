<i>Pass it to me</i>
<i>so we can spare you this threat.</i>

14:36.240 --> 14:38.240
<i>Then perhaps get to know each other a bit.</i>

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
<i>You think I'd hand it to you</i>
<i>just like that?</i>

14:40.680 --> 14:43.840
<i>Between the armies of Pendragon</i>
<i>and the paladins of Rome,</i>

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
<i>you will be snuffed like a candle flame.</i>

14:48.760 --> 14:51.040
<i>Everyone I trust told me not to come here.</i>

14:53.000 --> 14:54.600
<i>They said you were a deceiver</i>

14:55.280 --> 14:56.280
<i>and a drunkard.</i>

14:57.640 --> 15:00.720
<i>-I won't be pressured to giving it to you.</i>
<i>-I'm trying to protect you from--</i>

15:00.800 --> 15:02.720
<i>I've managed a lifetime</i>
<i>without your protection.</i>

15:14.720 --> 15:15.960
<i>Festa and Moreii.</i>

15:16.560 --> 15:18.280
<i>Born of rival clans.</i>

15:19.040 --> 15:20.400
<i>[voice whispers] Don't leave!</i>

15:20.480 --> 15:22.680
<i>They hid in this castle long ago</i>
<i>and drank hemlock</i>

15:22.760 --> 15:24.440

15:25.360 --> 15:26.760
<i>[whispering continues]</i>

<i>-Take care.</i>
<i>-[mystical twinkling]</i>

15:32.480 --> 15:34.040
<i>I have voices of my own.</i>

15:35.120 --> 15:36.960
<i>Now tell me how I came to be.</i>

15:41.320 --> 15:42.960
<i>Why won't you give me answers?</i>

15:44.280 --> 15:45.520
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

15:47.280 --> 15:49.120
<i>My answers will disappoint you.</i>

15:50.000 --> 15:51.680
<i>I will disappoint you.</i>

15:53.040 --> 15:55.120
<i>If you seek to earn my trust</i>

15:55.200 --> 15:56.880
<i>and this sword,</i>

15:56.960 --> 15:59.280
<i>you will tell me the truth</i>
<i>about your history with my mother.</i>

16:00.320 --> 16:02.640
<i>My words are inadequate to the task.</i>

16:04.600 --> 16:07.840
<i>But I chose this place</i>
<i>because Festa and Moreii, with our help,</i>

16:07.920 --> 16:10.400
<i>can allow you to see the past</i>
<i>with your own eyes.</i>

16:10.960 --> 16:12.320
<i>I don't understand.</i>

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
<i>You will.</i>

<i>Come.</i>

16:26.720 --> 16:28.200
<i>Green Knight, sir.</i>

16:31.920 --> 16:33.000
<i>Do I know you, boy?</i>

16:33.360 --> 16:34.520
<i>From when I was small.</i>

16:35.560 --> 16:36.640
<i>In Dewdenn.</i>

<i>-Gullayad, sir.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

<i>He carried a bit of weight back then.</i>

16:43.880 --> 16:45.600
<i>But he could hunt with a knife.</i>

16:46.440 --> 16:48.920
<i>He's dead now, sir.</i>

16:50.720 --> 16:53.240
<i>-You're the head of the family, then.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

16:54.000 --> 16:57.160
<i>And as I am accompanying you today</i>
<i>to secure our food supply,</i>

16:57.800 --> 17:01.000
<i>should I carry a sword or a spear?</i>

17:02.960 --> 17:04.720
<i>You can carry whatever you like,</i>

17:05.600 --> 17:07.760
<i>so long as you carry it</i>
<i>back to the children's room.</i>

17:09.480 --> 17:11.400
<i>I will see my kin avenged.</i>

17:11.480 --> 17:12.400
<i>Maybe.</i>

17:48.520 --> 17:49.520
<i>I'm holding it.</i>

17:50.040 --> 17:51.120
<i>I'm whittling it.</i>

17:51.200 --> 17:52.200
<i>It's in my hand.</i>

17:52.280 --> 17:53.280
<i>What's your guess?</i>

17:54.680 --> 17:55.800
<i>Show me how to use it.</i>

17:56.160 --> 17:58.560
<i>I'd rather drown myself in sheep's blood.</i>

18:00.040 --> 18:02.800

<i>[Merlin] Nimue.</i>

46:17.240 --> 46:19.200
<i>-What have you done?</i>
<i>-You're a murderer.</i>

46:19.680 --> 46:22.200
<i>I saw the mothers. I saw the executions.</i>

46:22.960 --> 46:24.520
<i>You killed innocents.</i>

46:24.960 --> 46:26.800
<i>You're steeped in blood.</i>

46:29.600 --> 46:31.280
<i>I've lived many lives.</i>

46:33.720 --> 46:36.160
<i>Some contained terrible mistakes.</i>

46:38.680 --> 46:39.680
<i>But tell me,</i>

46:41.320 --> 46:44.200
<i>how many have died by your hands</i>
<i>in these past weeks?</i>

46:45.680 --> 46:46.760
<i>They were killers.</i>

46:47.440 --> 46:49.320
<i>They burned everyone I knew.</i>

46:49.680 --> 46:50.520
<i>See?</i>

46:51.480 --> 46:53.440
<i>You're certain your cause is just.</i>

46:55.200 --> 46:56.480
<i>So was I certain.</i>

46:59.000 --> 47:01.320
<i>Revenge took ownership of me.</i>

47:02.720 --> 47:04.080
<i>It'll do the same to you</i>

47:04.600 --> 47:05.840
<i>because you're my kin.</i>

47:06.560 --> 47:08.240
<i>[Nimue groans loudly]</i>

47:10.160 --> 47:11.760
<i>I wish to the gods I wasn't!</i>

47:11.840 --> 47:12.880
<i>[yells] But you are!</i>

47:12.960 --> 47:15.520
<i>[groans, pants]</i>

47:30.320 --> 47:31.520
<i>Let me destroy it.</i>

47:31.600 --> 47:33.400
<i>[breathes heavily] What?</i>

47:33.960 --> 47:36.160
<i>That's my true intention,</i>
<i>if you must know.</i>

47:37.360 --> 47:41.320
<i>To melt it in the ancient Fey Fires</i>
<i>where it can harm no one ever again.</i>

47:44.720 --> 47:47.440
<i>What of the Fey? What of my people?</i>

47:47.920 --> 47:50.680
<i>Lenore didn't tell you</i>
<i>to save an entire race.</i>

47:51.120 --> 47:53.280
<i>She told you to bring the sword to me.</i>

47:53.360 --> 47:56.080
<i>She gambled that I had become</i>
<i>a better man. And I have.</i>

47:57.040 --> 47:59.920
<i>I swear I'll do everything in my power</i>
<i>to protect the Fey.</i>

48:01.880 --> 48:03.080
<i>You have my word.</i>

48:06.320 --> 48:08.120
<i>Release this burden, my child.</i>

48:09.640 --> 48:11.360
<i>[breathes shakily]</i>

48:19.200 --> 48:20.160
<i>Kaze?</i>

<i>-[horse brays]</i>
<i>-Well done, boy.</i>

48:27.280 --> 48:30.440
<i>Bind the Fey girl, but do not kill her.</i>

<i>Nimue. Nimue!</i>
<i>Pendragon's soldiers are outside.</i>

48:59.640 --> 49:00.840
<i>They've come for you.</i>

49:02.920 --> 49:04.280
<i>-You have betrayed me?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

49:04.800 --> 49:06.840
<i>I must have been followed.</i>
<i>I didn't call them here.</i>

49:06.920 --> 49:08.080
<i>I swear to you, Nimue!</i>

49:08.160 --> 49:10.800
<i>My mother's gamble failed.</i>
<i>You're not a better man.</i>

49:10.880 --> 49:11.720
<i>Nimue, please--</i>

49:11.800 --> 49:14.240
<i>-You were the only family I had left.</i>
<i>-I can still be!</i>

49:14.320 --> 49:16.040
<i>What was it my mother said to you?</i>

49:17.160 --> 49:19.320
<i>Let this be the last time I see your face.</i>

49:21.520 --> 49:22.600
<i>Quick. This way.</i>

49:25.800 --> 49:28.000

49:33.480 --> 49:34.800
<i>[horse brays]</i>

49:42.760 --> 49:44.640
<i>Ah, you thick-skulled oaf!</i>

49:45.080 --> 49:47.200
<i>You've stolen the sword</i>
<i>from your own king!</i>

49:48.720 --> 49:51.320
<i>It was your task, magician, not mine.</i>

49:52.320 --> 49:53.320
<i>Where is the witch?</i>

49:53.800 --> 49:54.800
<i>Gone.</i>

49:55.920 --> 49:56.920
<i>Ride ahead!</i>

49:57.600 --> 49:58.800
<i>Pick up her trail,</i>

49:59.320 --> 50:01.400
<i>if you mean to return home in one piece!</i>

50:01.480 --> 50:03.080
<i>[guard] Move out! Ya!</i>

50:03.160 --> 50:04.320
<i>Ya! Ya!</i>

50:06.280 --> 50:07.280
<i>Take him inside.</i>

<i>[Merlin groans]</i>

50:35.200 --> 50:36.640
<i>[Gawain] The mill is nearby.</i>

50:36.960 --> 50:40.040
<i>Dismount. We'll rest the horses here</i>
<i>and continue on foot.</i>

50:40.480 --> 50:43.000
<i>I suggest we stay mounted</i>
<i>with bows at the ready.</i>

50:44.200 --> 50:47.360
<i>You were not asked along</i>
<i>for your military expertise.</i>

50:48.680 --> 50:50.000
<i>Dismount.</i>

<i>[horse snorts]</i>

51:01.480 --> 51:03.560
<i>You won't listen to me because I'm human.</i>

51:04.120 --> 51:06.080
<i>Or better to die purebred, is that it?</i>

51:06.880 --> 51:07.720
<i>[Gawain] You.</i>

51:08.840 --> 51:11.720
<i>You can come with us to the mill,</i>
<i>or fetch water with him.</i>

51:12.160 --> 51:13.240
<i>Which do you choose?</i>

51:15.480 --> 51:16.320
<i>I...</i>

51:20.680 --> 51:22.480
<i>I'll fetch water, sir.</i>

51:34.400 --> 51:35.880
<i>You should have gone with them.</i>

51:38.520 --> 51:40.040
<i>If it please you, Lord Arthur,</i>

51:41.080 --> 51:43.160
<i>-I would like to be your squire.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

51:45.120 --> 51:46.600
<i>You are a fool, aren't you?</i>

51:47.160 --> 51:48.200
<i>I have no title.</i>

51:48.280 --> 51:51.280
<i>I want to learn to fight well enough</i>
<i>to help win back our land.</i>

51:51.360 --> 51:53.440
<i>I could learn that from a Man Blood,</i>
<i>couldn't I?</i>

52:04.560 --> 52:06.040
<i>I'm ready for my first lesson.</i>

52:07.560 --> 52:09.480
<i>Very well... squire.</i>
