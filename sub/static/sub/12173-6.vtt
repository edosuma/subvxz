00:03.480 --> 00:05.881
We should never have got into this, Tom.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.200
On the night ofjune 21st,

00:07.280 --> 00:09.726
a general strike will be called
across the city.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.131
CHARLIE: How do we know this foolish man

00:11.200 --> 00:12.929
will hand over the diamonds
when we're done?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.082
We don't. But that's another business.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.924
LINDA: When this business is done,
it will all be over.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.161
And afterwards,

00:18.240 --> 00:20.686
you and Arthur can begin your new life.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.728
So there are three cellars
underneath the house.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.131
There's a tunnel here that runs

00:24.200 --> 00:27.044
from the house, underneath the river,
to an underground strong room.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.522
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room, direct.

to you about the Priest.

I will bring this whole organisation

01:44.520 --> 01:48.286
I would very much like you to
join me in thanking the man

01:48.960 --> 01:52.043
that made the founding of this
establishment actually possible.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.404

Erm, I didn't come here today to
make a speech, but I will say this.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.649
These children are now safe.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.886
In our care, they will be safe.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.645
Because we are from the same
cold streets as they are.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.649
And in our care, they won't be
shipped away to the colonies,

02:45.960 --> 02:47.689
or separated from kin,

02:48.240 --> 02:51.881
or made to work for men
in their various ways.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.607
The absence of my invitation
for this event

03:51.680 --> 03:54.206
was obviously an oversight
on your part, Mr Shelby.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.687
Look, I have the keys.
I have allocated myself an office.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.760
Just there,
two doors in from the street,

04:03.840 --> 04:08.209
it's the one that already has the stove
and the crucifixion on the window.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.725
Mr Shelby?

04:11.080 --> 04:14.084
It is the one that has the crucifixion
on the window in orange and red,

04:14.160 --> 04:15.730
that will be my office.

04:16.279 --> 04:20.841
And I will take them to
Saint Aloysius for confession.

04:20.920 --> 04:25.926
You do understand these keys are
part of our broader arrangement?

04:33.160 --> 04:37.722
In the next 24 hours, you will do
exactly as you have been instructed.

Do you know any other guests

Some, I think. Yes.

Pol, I'm paid by the company now,
so I have to talk to other people.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.809
So you have moved from horses to
automobiles in just four years?

05:56.920 --> 05:59.207
When you ship to New York
you pay a higher dock duty.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.402
You should consider coming with us
through Boston.

JOHN: I just spoke to johnny Dogs.
He said the tunnel's hit heavy clay.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.851
- It's slowing him down.
- How long?

06:05.920 --> 06:07.490
Two days before they hit the wall.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.528
Tell him to dig a sinkhole
to drain the clay.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.802
He's asked if you could go down
and have a look yourself, Tom.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.604
I told him, wild horses
wouldn't get you down.

-(SIGHS) Yes.

I wish I had met your dear wife

before she was taken from us.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.485
And I would like to allocate
an hour a day of each of my lady's time

06:24.560 --> 06:26.244
to make winter clothes
for the little ones.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.802
Speak to my secretary, Ms Stark,
in the grey hat. She knows my diary.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.445
Fuck me, Tom.
I don't know how you do it.

Aw. Your little boy
looks so much like you.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.522
He does, yes.
He's a little rascal, isn't he?

06:38.600 --> 06:42.366
Mr Shelby, would it be too inconvenient
to steal you for a moment?

No, no. No inconvenience at all.

take him through the back door.

08:43.679 --> 08:44.806
All right.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.962
Hey, listen to me!
They put him in a car.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.122
They put him in a car and drove south.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.250
We've got roadblocks and spotters.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.011
I'll set up shop
and put every man we have

08:55.080 --> 08:57.651
-on the junctions from here to Maypole.
- Yeah. Yeah. Right. You do that.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.210
- But you have got to go to the office.
- Yeah.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.089
You've got to sit by the phone.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.730
- Whoever took him is going to call.
- Right. Of course.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.847
Polly!

09:04.520 --> 09:05.965
Let's go, Pol.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.085
Stay by that phone.
Me and john will cover the roads.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.209
TOMMY: I need Michael
at the Maypole junction.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.402
I need Moss to block
all the roads south.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.565
Give me Moss. Gone where?

09:30.360 --> 09:32.442
- Tommy...
- It's them.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.130
- Who?
- It's fucking them.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.725
Look, it mightjust be
some random woman.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.201
- Because sometimes women go mad...
- No, it is them.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.881
Did you break the phone?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.082
He broke the phone.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.400
It's all right,
we have got another phone.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.084
- ADA: Tommy?
- Ada?

09:52.680 --> 09:54.682
There's someone outside, a priest.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.524
Stay here, Pol, stay here.
Don't do anything.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.846
We have your son.
Get in the car.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.206
TOMMY:
First.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.011
Is he safe?

10:25.080 --> 10:27.128
Of course he's safe.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.208
All children are dear to me.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.681
You have all the cards.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.764
Tell me what you want me to do
and I will certainly do it.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.241
You ever drive one of these beasts?

10:38.320 --> 10:40.243
I am asking you to conduct business.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.209
Of course, I borrowed it.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.291
Lent it by a Lord
for the duration of this business.

10:46.360 --> 10:51.764
I will certainly do what you
need me to do with no complaint.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.606
We were forced into
doing this awful thing.

10:55.680 --> 11:01.130
We did warn you that your son would be
in danger if you deviated from the plan.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.406
It was you who made a mistake.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.641
- You understand?
- Yes.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.922
What mistake did you make?
Do you even know?

11:06.160 --> 11:08.481
Tell me what you want me to do.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.088
- You made a deal with our enemies.
- I will do what needs to be done.

11:12.160 --> 11:16.848
You went behind our backs to stop
the Soviets from blowing up the train.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.006
But it's all right. It's all right.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.082
We've rectified your mistake.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.328
You ask me, "What do I need to do?"

11:27.880 --> 11:31.362
Well, here is what you need to do,
you fucking mongrel, you...

11:36.240 --> 11:38.811
Since the Bolsheviks will not
be blowing up the train,

11:39.280 --> 11:40.725
you will blow up the train yourself.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.962
It has always been about the explosion

11:45.400 --> 11:49.166
from the beginning.
The bang. The outrage.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.685
Understand?

11:52.720 --> 11:56.167
Those are notes and fragments
for you to scatter in the wreckage,

11:56.240 --> 11:58.481
implicating named officials
from the Soviet Embassy.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.129
I will scatter them. It will be done.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.440
Good.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.003
<i>Our friends at The Times and
the Da/lyMa/lwill do the rest.</i>

12:06.080 --> 12:08.128
And once the British government

12:08.200 --> 12:11.568
cuts diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union,

12:11.680 --> 12:14.047
that will be our mission accomplished.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.726
You would have been
part of a fine adventure.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.729
To help with the outrage,
we need people to die in the explosion.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.881
How many?

12:25.680 --> 12:28.889
Let's say... six.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.327
Rail workers, perhaps,
men from the factory.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.042
(MOUTHING)

12:39.040 --> 12:44.604
And I want my son returned to me
within an hour of the explosion.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.490
Oh, it's conditions now, is it?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.082
We need to fix the
handover in advance.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.642
I haven't finished
with you yet, Mr Shelby.

12:54.760 --> 12:58.401
We also hear
that you are digging a tunnel.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.564
Mining for precious stones
under Wilderness House.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.487
I'm told they have a Fabergé
in the strong room.

13:08.560 --> 13:12.963
The Lilies of the Valley Egg
made in 1898.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.601
One of the Odd Fellows has a wife
who's obsessed with Fabergé.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.205
He wants to give her the egg
for her birthday.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.441
Then he will have it.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.161

have stolen to your office at dawn.

fucking broke her water.

- Out with the young ones,

14:25.720 --> 14:27.404
looking for the Riley.
We couldn't reach him.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.005
I need to know who spoke.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.889

14:31.680 --> 14:34.763
I need to know who spoke about business
outside of the family.

I need to know who spoke
and who they spoke to, now.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.608
- Tommy, listen, uh...
- Your wife, Arthur?

14:42.160 --> 14:46.722
I am going to tell myself that
you are not thinking straight.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.484
Your mind is not clear.

14:49.080 --> 14:52.050

You said he knows you.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.400

15:08.480 --> 15:12.565
If anyone has talked about
the tunnel to anyone else,

15:12.640 --> 15:14.802
I need to know,
and I need to know this second.

I'd trust those men with my life.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.051
- More than you trust us?
- Yes.

that I came back for love...

and common SENSE.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.722
And Esme's got no need for extra cash.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.289
And you bring my wife into this,

He came to you at my wedding.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.207
He pursued you. Sought you out.

Why would an educated man of his
standing do something like that?

Well, seeing as you were prepared
to pay such an exorbitant amount

19:37.640 --> 19:41.645
for this information, I decided
to give you value for money.

And then, here's all
the men on that list,

19:54.680 --> 19:56.648
you know, who would buy
the old Fabergé egg,

19:56.800 --> 19:59.007

that item was stolen.

Here is a list of the men
who would buy a Fabergé

Ah, yes. Thank you, Mr Shelby.
It's lovely doing business with you.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.890
You left a name off the list, Alfie.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.291
- Did I?
- Yeah.

I've already spoken to my people
in the jewellery quarter.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.128

three men in Britain

out into the fucking oggin, mate?

21:06.080 --> 21:07.923

21:08.880 --> 21:12.202
By withholding a name
that you most certainly know,

21:12.280 --> 21:15.887
you've proven to me that you have
done a deal with the Odd Fellows.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.725

about the tunnel.

21:18.800 --> 21:23.044
You who told them about the
fucking deal with the Soviets.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.121
Reason two.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.406
The name of the man that you're
withholding must be my enemy

21:27.560 --> 21:29.483
otherwise,
you wouldn't be protecting him.

ain't you?

I killed a man.

Well, he needed cover.
I was all he had.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.610
So what did he give you?

29:47.080 --> 29:49.242
He said it was good for close range.

You're better with my Smith & Wesson.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.126
We understand.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.048
So at an alternative time,

52:05.880 --> 52:07.006
when we have all recovered...

52:09.040 --> 52:10.246
I would like

52:11.600 --> 52:12.931
to put before the family

52:13.960 --> 52:15.246
an alternative view

52:17.000 --> 52:20.163
of the future
of the Shelby Company Limited.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.888
A more hopeful view.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.600
(CHARLES CRYING)

52:30.080 --> 52:32.162
Which I, for one,
would quite like to hear.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.281
As would I.

52:35.120 --> 52:36.565
As would I.

52:43.560 --> 52:44.846
LINDA: Come on, Arthur.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.169
The train for the dock
leaves in one hour.

52:48.520 --> 52:50.409
Then we'll get the boat to New York,

52:51.560 --> 52:52.800
and it'll all be in the past.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.403
I will be off then, Tom.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.404
(ARTHUR SNIFFLES)

53:36.520 --> 53:37.806
I will see you, eh?

53:40.880 --> 53:42.962
I will see you, Brother.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.891
Bye, Curly.

53:55.920 --> 53:58.161
You can go,
but you won't get far, Arthur.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.481
Uh, all right, Tom.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.244
I spoke to Moss last night.

54:05.120 --> 54:07.282
He told me that the
Chief Constable of Birmingham

54:07.360 --> 54:10.728
has issued a warrant for your arrest.

54:11.200 --> 54:13.168
Murder, sedition,

54:13.800 --> 54:15.370
conspiracy to cause explosions.

54:16.960 --> 54:19.361
John, they're coming for you as well.

54:19.920 --> 54:23.083
Murder, conspiracy to cause explosions.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.201
Michael...

54:25.280 --> 54:27.362
ARTHUR: What the fuck?
TOMMY: ...for the murder of Hughes.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.241
Polly...

54:31.000 --> 54:33.048
ARTHUR: Wait a minute,
what the fuck are you...

54:33.120 --> 54:35.805
...the murder of
Chief Inspector Chester Campbell.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.125
JOHN: Why didn't you
fucking tell us, Tom?

54:38.200 --> 54:40.168
The people we betrayed last night,
they want to bring us down.

54:40.320 --> 54:43.881
They control the police,
they control the judges,

54:43.960 --> 54:46.691
the control the juries,
they control the jails.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.683
But they do not control...

54:48.840 --> 54:50.251
-j0HN: Look what they did to us.
-...the elected government.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.209
JOHN: Why didn't you tell us before?
ARTHUR: You are my brother.

54:52.280 --> 54:53.486
TOMMY: Listen to me.

54:53.640 --> 54:55.563
So I've made a deal.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.290
- They will hang us!
- In return

54:57.480 --> 54:59.289
for giving evidence against them.

54:59.480 --> 55:00.561
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- ARTHUR: We will fucking hang.

55:00.640 --> 55:01.846
It is all taken care of.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.924
Lizzie, collect up the money
and bring it to the cellar.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.524
You will all get your money
in due course.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.763
When the police gets in, do not resist.

55:10.840 --> 55:14.003
You go with them,
and you do not say anything.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.286
Arthur,

55:15.440 --> 55:19.240
I have made a deal with people even
more powerful than our enemies.

55:19.360 --> 55:20.805
- LINDA: (SCREAMING) Arthur!
- Trust me, Brother, eh?

55:22.600 --> 55:23.931
Trust me.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.362
- ARTHUR: No, Linda...
- You did this deliberately!

55:27.440 --> 55:29.807
You made this happen to keep us!

55:29.920 --> 55:31.126
Come here. Come here.

55:31.880 --> 55:34.087
ARTHUR: Come on now, we
have to run. We have to run.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.924
(ALL CLAMOU RING)

55:39.600 --> 55:40.886
ARTHUR: Fuck you!

55:41.880 --> 55:43.962
