00:04.938 --> 00:08.237
OLDER TED: Kids, I'm gonna tell you
an incredible story.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.741
The story of how I met your mother.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.711
- Are we being punished for something?
- No.

00:13.813 --> 00:16.441
- Yeah, is this gonna take a while?
- Yes.

00:17.050 --> 00:21.419
Twenty-five years ago, before I was Dad,
I had this whole other life.

00:25.825 --> 00:28.020
<i>It was way back in 2005,</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.790
<i>I was 27, just starting</i>
<i>to make it as an architect</i>

00:30.897 --> 00:33.889
<i>and living in New York with Marshall,</i>
<i>my best friend from college,</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:35.126
<i>My life was good,</i>

00:35.235 --> 00:38.932
<i>And then Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>went and screwed the whole thing up,</i>

00:39.172 --> 00:40.799
Will you marry me?

00:41.508 --> 00:42.770
Yes. Perfect.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.640
And then you're engaged,
you pop the champagne, you drink a toast,

00:45.745 --> 00:47.736
you have sex on the kitchen floor.

00:47.847 --> 00:50.213
- Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
- Got it.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.806
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.284
Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Lily.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.685
I've been there for all the big moments
of you and Lily.

00:56.823 --> 01:01.157
The night you met,
your first date, other first things.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.394
Yeah, sorry, we thought you were asleep.

01:04.497 --> 01:05.623
It's physics, Marshall.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.860
If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.

01:10.203 --> 01:13.639
My God, you're getting engaged tonight.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.174
Yeah. What are you doing tonight?

01:18.144 --> 01:20.544
<i>What was I doing? Here, Uncle Marshall</i>

01:20.647 --> 01:23.172
<i>was taking the biggest step of his life,</i>
<i>And me?</i>

01:23.283 --> 01:25.513
<i>I'm calling up your Uncle Barney,</i>

01:25.618 --> 01:28.314
Hey, so you know how
I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls?

01:29.956 --> 01:33.756
Well, now I've got a new favorite.
Lebanese girls.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.756
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

01:36.863 --> 01:38.455
Hey, you wanna do something tonight?

01:38.565 --> 01:41.329
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

01:44.337 --> 01:46.999
- Hey.
- Where's your suit?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.598
Just once, when I say "suit up,"
I wish you'd put on a suit.

01:49.709 --> 01:53.145
- I did. That one time.
- It was a blazer.

01:54.681 --> 01:58.082
You know, ever since college
it's been Marshall and Lily and me.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.110
Now it's gonna be
Marshall and Lily and me.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.018
They'll get married, start a family.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.182
Before long,
I'm that weird middle-aged bachelor

02:05.291 --> 02:07.418
their kids call "Uncle Ted."

02:09.929 --> 02:11.226
I see what this is about.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.526
Have you forgotten what I said to you
the night we met?

02:15.802 --> 02:18.362
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.740
- Barney. We met at the urinal.
- Oh, right. Hi.

02:22.842 --> 02:26.209
Lesson one, lose the goatee.
It doesn't go with your suit.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.906
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two, get a suit.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.006
Suits are cool. Exhibit A.

02:31.684 --> 02:32.673
Lesson three,

02:32.785 --> 02:36.084
don't even think about getting married
till you're 30.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.350
Thirty. Right, you're right.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.323
I guess it's just, your best friend
gets engaged,

02:40.426 --> 02:43.623
- you start thinking about that stuff.
- I thought I was your best friend.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.460
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.161
- You're my best friend, Barney.
- Good.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.965
Then as your best friend, I suggest we play
a little game I like to call,

02:52.071 --> 02:53.299
"Have you met Ted?"

02:53.406 --> 02:55.067
No, no, no, no, we're not playing
"Have you met Ted."

02:55.175 --> 02:56.540
Hi, have you met Ted?

02:57.477 --> 03:00.446
- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Yasmin.

03:00.713 --> 03:03.773
- It's a very pretty name.
- Thanks. It's Lebanese.

03:07.053 --> 03:08.020
Hey.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.355
(GROANS)

03:09.489 --> 03:10.683
I'm exhausted.

03:10.790 --> 03:14.157
It was finger-painting day at school
and a 5-year-old boy

03:14.260 --> 03:16.353
got to second base with me.

03:17.764 --> 03:21.097
- Wow, you're cooking?
- Yes, I am.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.804
Are you sure that's a good idea
after last time.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.669
You looked really creepy
without eyebrows.

03:28.908 --> 03:29.897
I can handle this.

03:30.009 --> 03:32.239
I think you'll find
I'm full of surprises tonight.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.370
So there's more surprises? Like what?

03:34.747 --> 03:36.681
<i>Marshall was in his second year</i>
<i>of law school,</i>

03:36.783 --> 03:39.149
<i>so he was pretty good</i>
<i>at thinking on his feet,</i>

03:39.252 --> 03:42.517
Boogedy boo! And that's all of them.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.988
I'm gonna go cook.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.488
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

03:48.595 --> 03:50.722
I just couldn't imagine settling down
right now.

03:50.830 --> 03:54.357
- So do you think you'll ever get married?
- Well, maybe eventually.

03:54.701 --> 03:57.602
Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.965
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.063
Band, no DJ.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.235
People will dance,
I'm not gonna worry about it.

04:05.445 --> 04:08.437
Damn it, why did Marshall
have to get engaged?

04:08.581 --> 04:12.017
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning
out his own imaginary wedding, huh?

04:12.118 --> 04:15.713
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.788
One more for the lady!

04:18.858 --> 04:20.826
Oh, hey, look what I got.

04:24.163 --> 04:27.155
Oh, honey, champagne.

04:28.735 --> 04:29.827
Yeah.

04:31.170 --> 04:34.936
No, you are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.008
I'm not scared.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.009
- Then open it.
- Fine.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.078
Please, open it.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.045
Gosh, you are unbelievable, Marshall.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.743
<i>There are two big questions</i>
<i>a man has to ask in life,</i>

04:45.852 --> 04:48.548
<i>One you plan out for months,</i>
<i>the other just slips out</i>

04:48.655 --> 04:50.350
<i>when you're half-drunk at some bar,</i>

04:50.456 --> 04:51.514
Will you marry me?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.926
You wanna go out sometime?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.790
Of course, you idiot!

04:57.230 --> 04:59.790
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.592
What's up, Carl?

05:07.607 --> 05:10.075
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.843
Did you know there's a Pop-Tart
under your fridge?

05:13.946 --> 05:15.504
No, but dibs.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.147
Where's that champagne?

05:18.718 --> 05:21.653
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.

05:25.024 --> 05:27.618
I don't know why I was so scared of this.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.126
It's pretty easy, right?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.591
(LILY SCREAMING)

05:31.931 --> 05:34.229
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden?
This is crazy.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.858
I'm not ready to settle down.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.163
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl?

05:38.838 --> 05:39.896
The plan's always been

05:40.006 --> 05:41.564
don't even think about it until you're 30.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.767
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.410
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.742
Even if I was ready, which I'm not,

05:48.848 --> 05:53.581
but if I was, it's like,
"Okay, I'm ready. Where is she?"

05:57.523 --> 05:59.150
<i>And there she was,</i>

06:05.164 --> 06:07.189
<i>It was like something from an old movie</i>

06:07.300 --> 06:10.428
<i>where the sailor sees the girl</i>
<i>across the crowded dance floor,</i>

06:10.536 --> 06:12.299
<i>turns to his buddy and says,</i>

06:12.405 --> 06:15.238
<i>"See that girl?</i>
<i>I'm gonna marry her someday, "</i>

06:15.908 --> 06:18.376
Hey, Barney, see that girl?

06:18.478 --> 06:21.174
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.845
- Go say hi.
- I can't just go say hi.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.345
I need a plan.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.976
I'm gonna wait
until she goes to the bathroom,

06:28.087 --> 06:30.555
then I'll strategically place myself
by the jukebox so that...

06:30.656 --> 06:32.419
Hi, have you met Ted?

06:34.460 --> 06:35.449
Hi.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.519
Let me guess. Ted.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.426
I'm sorry, Lily.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.833
I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.269
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you hit her?

06:49.308 --> 06:50.798
Hit me? Please.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.743
This guy can barely even spank me
in bed for fun.

06:53.846 --> 06:56.508
He's all, like, "Oh, honey, did that hurt?"

06:56.616 --> 06:59.483
And I'm, like,
"Come on, let me have you, you pansy."

07:00.286 --> 07:03.744
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, it's okay. Go on.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.057
So, these spankings,

07:06.159 --> 07:09.185
are you in pajamas or <i>au natural?</i>

07:10.696 --> 07:13.256
- So what do you do?
- I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.834
- Oh.
- Well, kind of a reporter.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.403
I do those dumb little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

07:18.504 --> 07:22.736
You know, like,
"Monkey who can play the ukulele."

07:22.842 --> 07:24.901
But I'm hoping to get some
bigger stories soon.

07:25.011 --> 07:28.105
Bigger, like,
"Gorilla with an upright bass?"

07:28.214 --> 07:29.704
Sorry. You're really pretty.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.851
- Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.
- Yeah.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.980
See, the one in the middle
just got dumped by her boyfriend.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.650
So tonight, every guy is "the enemy."

07:40.760 --> 07:42.057
You know,
if it'll make your friend feel better

07:42.161 --> 07:44.652
you could throw a drink in my face.
I don't mind.

07:44.864 --> 07:48.766
She would love that.
And it does look fun in the movies.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.267
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

07:51.370 --> 07:54.339
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.068
Some guy's attempting
to make the world's biggest pancake.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.440
- Guess who's covering it?
- That's gonna take a week?

07:59.545 --> 08:01.877
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.142
Hey, what's taking so long?

08:05.017 --> 08:08.544
I know this is a long shot,
but how about tomorrow night?

08:09.388 --> 08:11.379
Yeah. What the hell.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.627
Jerk!

08:19.532 --> 08:20.999
That was fun.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.901
De... Wait for it... nied.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.197
Denied.

08:26.873 --> 08:27.965
We're going out tomorrow night.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.565
I thought we were playing
Lazer Tag tomorrow night.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.543
Yeah, I was never gonna go play
Lazer Tag.

08:36.215 --> 08:39.582
<i>The next night, I took her out</i>
<i>to this little bistro in Brooklyn,</i>

08:39.986 --> 08:41.044
Wow.

08:41.153 --> 08:44.611
- That is one bad-ass blue French horn.
- Yeah.

08:44.724 --> 08:47.955
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.823
<i>Son, a piece of advice,</i>

08:49.929 --> 08:53.831
<i>When you go on a first date,</i>
<i>you really don't want to say Smurf penis,</i>

08:53.933 --> 08:56.299
<i>Girls don't ordinarily like that,</i>

08:57.603 --> 09:00.071
<i>But this was no ordinary girl,</i>

09:04.610 --> 09:05.907
Lily.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.006
How long have you been sitting there?

09:09.115 --> 09:11.208
Stupid eye patch.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.885
Mom, Dad,
I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.185
Marshall, how have I always described
my perfect woman?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.920
Let's see.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.017
She likes dogs?

09:23.129 --> 09:24.494
I've got five dogs.

09:24.597 --> 09:25.621
She drinks Scotch?

09:25.731 --> 09:28.666
I love a Scotch
that's old enough to order its own Scotch.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.599
Can quote obscure lines from
<i>Ghostbusters?</i>

09:30.703 --> 09:34.696
"Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a God, you say, 'Yes!"'

09:35.808 --> 09:37.969
And I'm saving the best for last.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.404
Do you want these? I hate olives.

09:40.613 --> 09:44.344
- She hates olives. Awesome!
- The Olive Theory.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.448
The Olive Theory
is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.544
He hates olives, she loves them.
And in a weird way,

09:49.655 --> 09:51.350
that's what makes them
such a great couple.

09:51.457 --> 09:52.788
Perfect balance.

09:53.626 --> 09:57.892
You know, I've had a jar of olives
just sitting in my fridge forever.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.798
I could take them off your hands.

10:02.401 --> 10:04.028
They're all yours.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.032
Oh, it is on!

10:06.138 --> 10:08.606
It is on till the break of dawn.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.975
But, wait, it's only the break of 10:30.
What happened?

10:15.114 --> 10:18.049
I gotta get one of those blue French horns
for over my fireplace.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.879
It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.317
- No green clarinet?
- Nope.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.819
Come on, no purple tuba?

10:22.922 --> 10:25.447
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.448
There you are!

10:27.560 --> 10:30.586
We got a jumper.
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.789
Come on, you're covering it.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.289
All right, I'll be right there.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.767
I'm sorry.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.804
I had a really great time tonight.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.608
Yeah, well.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.605
So, did you kiss her?

10:45.144 --> 10:47.135
No, the moment wasn't right.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.271
Look, this woman
could actually be my future wife.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.145
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.844
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.751
So, you chickened out like a little bitch.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.049
What? I did not chicken out.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.252
You know what?
I don't need to take first kiss advice

11:02.361 --> 11:05.797
from some pirate who hasn't been single
since the first week of college.

11:05.898 --> 11:08.389
Ted, anyone who's single
would tell you the same thing.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.969
Even the dumbest single person alive.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.229
And if you don't believe me, call him.

11:15.508 --> 11:20.002
Hey, loser, how's not playing Lazer Tag?
Because playing Lazer Tag is awesome.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.608
Oh, I killed you, Connor.
Don't make me get your mom.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.706
Hey, listen,
I need your opinion on something.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.513
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

11:28.921 --> 11:31.788
So, these guys think I chickened out.
What do you think?

11:32.358 --> 11:36.124
I can't believe
you're still not wearing a suit.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.560
She didn't even give me the signal.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.758
What, is she gonna
bat her eyes at you in Morse code?

11:41.867 --> 11:42.925
"Ted,

11:44.136 --> 11:45.194
"kiss me."

11:45.304 --> 11:48.899
- No, you just kiss her.
- Not if you don't get the signal.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.578
- Did Marshall give me the signal?
- No!

11:54.680 --> 11:56.443
I didn't, I swear.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.845
But, see, at least tonight,
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

12:00.953 --> 12:03.683
never gonna happen.
You should've kissed her.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.313
I should've kissed her.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.392
Well, maybe in a week
when she gets back from Orlando.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.859
A week? That's like a year in hot-girl time.

12:09.962 --> 12:10.986
She'll forget all about you.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.396
Mark my words,
you will never see that one again.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.331
There she is.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.360
She's cute. Hey, Carl, turn it up.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.364
<i>,,, persuaded him to reconsider,</i>

12:21.474 --> 12:23.772
<i>At which point</i>
<i>the man came down off the ledge,</i>

12:23.876 --> 12:26.504
<i>giving this bizarre story a happy ending,</i>

12:26.946 --> 12:28.106
<i>Reporting from Metro 1 News,</i>

12:28.214 --> 12:30.205
<i>- back to you, Bill,</i>
- The guy didn't jump.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.545
I'm gonna go kiss her.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.812
- Right now.
- Look, dude, it's midnight.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.856
As your future lawyer,
I'm gonna advise you that's freaking crazy.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.255
I never do anything crazy.

12:40.359 --> 12:42.987
I'm always waiting for the moment,
planning the moment.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.154
Well, she's leaving tomorrow
and this may be the only moment

12:45.264 --> 12:46.458
I'm gonna get.

12:46.565 --> 12:50.092
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.
I gotta take the leap.

12:50.703 --> 12:51.897
Okay, not a perfect metaphor

12:52.004 --> 12:53.528
'cause for me
it's fall in love and get married

12:53.639 --> 12:55.539
and for him it's death.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.567
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

12:59.545 --> 13:02.241
By the way, did I congratulate you two?

13:03.015 --> 13:05.415
- I'm doing this.
- Let's go.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.985
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.614
Barney?

13:10.823 --> 13:13.291
All right, but under one condition.

13:14.593 --> 13:17.187
Look at you, you beautiful bastard,
you suited up.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.662
This is totally going in my blog.

13:20.599 --> 13:23.159
Stop the car. Pull over right here.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.000
I gotta do something.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.838
Excuse me. Pardon me, just a sec.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.441
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Hey!

13:31.043 --> 13:32.010
Hey!

13:32.378 --> 13:34.005
Go, go, go!

13:36.916 --> 13:38.884
Everybody brings flowers.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.625
Okay, moment of truth.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.592
- Wish me luck.
- Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.292
"This just in." Okay.

13:58.871 --> 14:02.034
- Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good.
- Kiss the crap out of that girl.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.234
Marshall, remember this night.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.903
When you're the best man at our wedding
and you give a speech,

14:07.012 --> 14:08.604
you're gonna tell this story.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.407
Why does he get to be the best man?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.486
I'm your best friend!

14:15.221 --> 14:18.987
<i>As I walked up to that door,</i>
<i>a million thoughts raced through my mind,</i>

14:19.091 --> 14:21.491
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>one particular thought did not,</i>

14:21.594 --> 14:23.061
I've got five dogs.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.120

14:25.364 --> 14:27.127
<i>Not good, not good,</i>

14:27.233 --> 14:28.393
- No!
- Get back in there.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.127
You're wearing a suit!

14:34.139 --> 14:35.163
ROBIN: Ted?

14:36.208 --> 14:37.197
Hi.

14:39.778 --> 14:41.302
I was just...

14:45.551 --> 14:46.882
Come on up.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.248
MARSHALL: He's in.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.789
So, Ranjit, you must have done it
with a Lebanese girl?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.159
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.459
I'm gonna see
if that bodega has a bathroom.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.302
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.930
- The women hot there?
- Here's a picture of my wife.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.043
(WHISPERING) A simple "no"
would have sufficed.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.245
She's lovely.

15:16.482 --> 15:21.146
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn
at 1:00 in the morning in a suit?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.518
I was just hoping to

15:25.357 --> 15:26.756
get those olives

15:27.126 --> 15:29.185
that you said I could have.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.355
Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?

15:32.464 --> 15:34.728
Are you trying to get me drunk?

15:38.837 --> 15:40.634
For starters.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.630
<i>(MUSIC PLA YING)</i>

15:44.276 --> 15:45.903
Thank you.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.116
So, Marshall,
this Olive Theory based on you and Lily.

15:51.216 --> 15:52.911
- Yeah.
- You hate olives.

15:53.018 --> 15:56.215
- Lily loves them, you can't stand them.
- Yeah, I hate olives.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.517
Two weeks ago,
Spanish bar on 79th Street.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.024
Dish of olives. You had some. What up?

16:04.697 --> 16:07.530
You have to swear
that this does not leave this cab.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.758
- I swear.
- I swear.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.505
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.699
Lily asked if she could have my olives.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.209
I said, "Sure, I hate olives."

16:19.311 --> 16:20.972
But you like olives.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.640
Well, I was 18, okay? I was a virgin.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.718
Been waiting my whole life
for a pretty girl to want my olives.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.013
Marshall, I'm gonna give you
an early wedding present.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.750
Don't get married.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.766
I think I like your Olive Theory.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.927
I think I like your new French horn.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.407
I think I like your nose.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.470
I think I'm in love with you.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.567
What?

16:53.679 --> 16:54.646
What?

16:54.747 --> 16:55.714
What?

16:55.948 --> 16:58.007
Come on, man, you said your stomach's
been hurting, right?

16:58.117 --> 17:01.883
You know what that is? Hunger.
You're hungry for experience.

17:01.987 --> 17:05.888
Hungry for something new.
Hungry for olives.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.816
But you're too scared
to do anything about it.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.952
Yeah, I'm scared, okay?

17:12.464 --> 17:15.865
But when I think of spending
the rest of my life with Lily,

17:15.968 --> 17:18.492
committing forever, no other women,

17:19.605 --> 17:21.539
doesn't scare me at all.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.071
I'm marrying that girl.

17:25.676 --> 17:26.769
Lily.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.376
Lily, I like olives.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.077
We'll make it work.

17:34.319 --> 17:35.718
(SIGHING)

17:44.129 --> 17:46.927
So, Orlando? You gonna hit Disney World?

17:48.367 --> 17:50.460
- You love me?
- Oh, God.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.638
I can't believe I said that.
Why did I say that?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.229
Who says that?

17:55.774 --> 17:57.867
- I should just go.
- Hold on.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.944
Wait a minute.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.678
I promised you these.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.805
- Olives.
- Yeah.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.714
Thanks. I love you.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.650
What is wrong with me?

18:10.589 --> 18:13.387
Why are we still sitting here? Let's go.
We can still make last call.

18:13.492 --> 18:16.928
What do you say, Lil?
"Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum"?

18:19.665 --> 18:23.294
- 'Cause you're a pirate?
- Okay, eye patch gone.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.793
And we can't just abandon Ted.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.996
If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.043
It's been, like, 20 minutes.
Do you think they're doing it?

18:32.144 --> 18:33.668
You think they're doing it
in front of the dogs?

18:33.779 --> 18:35.371
Doggie style.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.740
I knew this girl in college,
she had this Golden Retriever...

18:37.850 --> 18:39.943
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.314
Hit it, Ranjit.

18:46.758 --> 18:48.851
So, when you tell this story
to your friends,

18:48.961 --> 18:50.895
could you avoid the word "psycho"?

18:51.196 --> 18:53.391
I'd prefer "eccentric."

18:54.299 --> 18:56.164
Goodnight, psycho.

19:00.906 --> 19:01.873
Great.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.401
- How do I get to the F train?
- Oh.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.743
- Two blocks, that way and take a right.
- Thanks.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.140
You know what?

19:14.286 --> 19:17.551
I'm done being single. I'm not good at it.

19:17.956 --> 19:20.584
Look, obviously,
you can't tell a woman you just met

19:20.692 --> 19:24.458
you love her, but it sucks that you can't.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.831
I'll tell you something, though. If a woman,

19:27.933 --> 19:30.766
not you, just some hypothetical woman,

19:30.869 --> 19:33.531
were to bear with me through all this,

19:33.639 --> 19:37.075
I think I'd make a damn good husband
because that's the stuff I'd be good at.

19:37.176 --> 19:41.044
Stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father

19:42.047 --> 19:44.607
and walking her five hypothetical dogs.

19:46.118 --> 19:47.642
Being a good kisser.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.813
- Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
- Oh, I've got references.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.049
Goodnight, Ted.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.364
- And I'm a good handshaker.
- That's a pretty great handshake.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.839
And that was it.
I'll probably never see her again.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.681
- What?
- That was the signal.

20:17.783 --> 20:21.310
That long, lingering handshake.
You should've kissed her.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.278
There's no such thing as the signal.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.653
But, yeah, that was the signal.

20:26.792 --> 20:27.952
Signal.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.596
Carl, thank you.
There's something I gotta do.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.359
By the way, you should've kissed her.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.829
Carl, you guys weren't there.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.665
I am so turned on right now.

20:43.642 --> 20:46.440
Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal.

20:46.745 --> 20:50.613
- That was not the signal.
- Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

20:51.283 --> 20:54.616
- To my fiancée.
- To the future.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.585
To one hell of a night.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.026
That was not the signal.

21:03.428 --> 21:07.364
<i>I asked her about it years later,</i>
<i>and, yeah, that was the signal,</i>

21:07.466 --> 21:08.865
<i>I could've kissed her,</i>

21:08.967 --> 21:12.801
<i>But that's the funny thing about destiny,</i>
<i>it happens whether you plan it or not,</i>

21:12.904 --> 21:14.929
<i>I mean, I never thought</i>
<i>I'd see that girl again,</i>

21:15.040 --> 21:16.166
<i>But it turns out,</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:19.403
<i>I was just too close to the puzzle</i>
<i>to see the picture that was forming,</i>

21:19.511 --> 21:21.979
Because that, kids, is the true story

21:22.080 --> 21:24.241
of how I met your Aunt Robin.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.841
Aunt Robin?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.715
I thought this was how you met Mom.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.845
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.689
Like I said, it's a long story.
