WEBVTT

00:03.870 --> 00:05.104
Hi, Mommy.

00:05.136 --> 00:06.505
Sweetie.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:06.538 --> 00:08.206
Hey. Okay,
hand me that.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.710
Honey, what did I
tell you about eating
food off the floor?

00:10.743 --> 00:12.579
That's just for Daddy.

00:16.282 --> 00:17.684
That's right.

00:17.716 --> 00:20.385
All right, now go down
to the kitchen, get
a clean one and eat it there.

00:20.419 --> 00:21.521
Okay.

00:27.292 --> 00:28.361
(EXCLAIMS)

00:29.327 --> 00:30.763
Oh, baby!

00:36.134 --> 00:39.805
Oh, Cheryl, will you stop
obsessing over that
stupid baby report card?

00:39.838 --> 00:41.774
The pediatrician said
Kyle was perfect.

00:41.807 --> 00:44.377
I just don't get it.
His height and weight are
right down the middle

00:44.409 --> 00:47.179
but his head size is
just off the chart.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.286
I gave birth to
Mr. Potato Head.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.286
Mmm.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.554
(DOOR OPENS)

00:53.319 --> 00:55.554
Hey.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.423
Oh, well, son of
Mr. Potato Head.

00:57.456 --> 00:58.791
(LAUGHS)

00:58.823 --> 01:02.195
Cheryl, I have got some
great news that's gonna
knock your socks off

01:02.228 --> 01:03.563
and hopefully
your shirt and
pants too.

01:03.595 --> 01:06.298
Oh!

01:03.595 --> 01:06.298
We got a free
trip to Vegas!

01:06.331 --> 01:10.635
Yeah, Sin City,
Bugsy Siegel's
folly in the desert.

01:10.668 --> 01:12.304
Did you want
to tell them?

01:10.668 --> 01:12.304
Yeah.

01:12.337 --> 01:14.539
Wait, we got a free
trip to Vegas?

01:14.572 --> 01:15.841
Well, not exactly "we."

01:15.875 --> 01:17.810
Yeah, no, no, it's
a business trip, okay?

01:17.843 --> 01:21.546
This foam insulation
company is sending me
and Jim to a trade show

01:21.579 --> 01:24.250
to demonstrate
their new product.

01:24.283 --> 01:26.352
Did you want to
tell them that too?

01:27.887 --> 01:29.454
Yeah. So it's just
you and Andy?

01:29.487 --> 01:31.356
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:31.390 --> 01:32.457
Dana, you want
to come?

01:32.490 --> 01:33.759
What?

01:33.792 --> 01:36.262
Well, we need
an assistant for
the demonstration.

01:36.295 --> 01:39.132
And as an added bonus,
she's like
a human rabbit's foot.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.901
Oh, no, you guys.
That time at the riverboat
casino was just a fluke.

01:41.933 --> 01:43.668
Oh, come on, I made
400 bucks at baccarat.

01:43.701 --> 01:47.140
I don't even know
what that is.

01:47.173 --> 01:51.177
And I won 50 at the slots
and that rash on
my inner thigh cleared up.

01:53.578 --> 01:57.215
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, I am not
going without Cheryl.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.518
Ha!

01:57.248 --> 01:58.518
All right.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.385
But if you wanted to come,

02:00.418 --> 02:03.622
the company would
pay for your whole trip
plus 50 bucks a day.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.358
I'll get you
something really nice
from the gift shop.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.626
Oh!

02:06.659 --> 02:08.461
Jim, I don't
believe you.

02:06.659 --> 02:08.461
What?

02:08.493 --> 02:10.895
We haven't been
on a vacation since...
I don't know when.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.866
Oh, baloney!
What about that time we went
downtown for five nights

02:13.899 --> 02:15.700
and they waited
on you hand and foot.

02:15.734 --> 02:17.137
The hospital?

02:17.870 --> 02:19.472
Well...

02:19.504 --> 02:21.640
I was giving birth
to your son.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.343
Cheryl, you didn't
have to cook, did you?

02:26.277 --> 02:27.812
All right, fine. Fine.

02:27.846 --> 02:30.383
But if you're gonna
go on a vacation,
I'm gonna go on a vacation.

02:30.415 --> 02:31.751
What?

02:30.415 --> 02:31.751
And if you're not
taking us with you,

02:31.783 --> 02:32.918
then I'm taking
the kids to Hawaii.

02:32.951 --> 02:35.420
Well, I...

02:32.951 --> 02:35.420
Yeah, first class.
On a yacht.

02:35.454 --> 02:36.556
Oh! Presidential suite.

02:36.588 --> 02:38.557
All right. All right.
All right.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.526
Family vacation in Vegas.

02:40.558 --> 02:41.493
(EXCLAIMS)

02:41.526 --> 02:44.396
All right, pack your bags
and shave your legs.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.431
Oh!

02:45.463 --> 02:46.966
(LAUGHS)

02:46.998 --> 02:48.400
(GIGGLES EXCITEDLY)

02:48.433 --> 02:53.239
Well, I'm off to the mall.
I saw this pair of shoes
that really say Vegas.

02:53.271 --> 02:54.573
In what way?

02:54.606 --> 02:57.676
They have the word
"Vegas" written on them.

02:57.710 --> 03:01.514
Hey, I'll go with you.
I could use one of those
Mrs. Smetzel's Pretzels.

03:01.546 --> 03:04.516
They are so good.
I swear there's
nicotine in them.

03:06.318 --> 03:08.554
Okay, what's up?
You hate Vegas.

03:08.586 --> 03:10.488
Okay. Can you
keep a secret?

03:10.521 --> 03:12.292
Not if you
tell it to me.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.294
From Jim?

03:15.326 --> 03:17.430
Oh, okay,
my pleasure, spill.

03:17.462 --> 03:19.431
All right,
you ready?

03:17.462 --> 03:19.431
Yeah.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.600
I've been
keeping in touch
with Jim's sister.

03:21.633 --> 03:23.902
Roxanne?
Oh, my God.

03:23.936 --> 03:27.006
Yeah. I've been trying
and trying to figure out a way
to get them talking again.

03:27.038 --> 03:29.307
Well, a year ago,
she moved to Vegas.

03:29.341 --> 03:31.544
This is perfect.
It's like destiny.

03:31.576 --> 03:33.746
Okay, wait a minute,
Cheryl, don't they
hate each other?

03:33.778 --> 03:36.514
Oh, Dana, come on.

03:36.548 --> 03:37.717
If they really
hated each other,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.519
they would have signed
the police report.

03:47.693 --> 03:48.694
(EXCLAIMS HAPPILY)

03:48.728 --> 03:52.365
Blackjack! I can't lose.
Thank you, rabbit's foot.

03:52.397 --> 03:53.865
(SIGHS)

03:52.397 --> 03:53.865
(STAMMERING)

03:53.899 --> 03:55.033
(GRUNTING)

03:55.067 --> 03:56.968
Hey, how's it going?

03:57.002 --> 04:00.706
Oh, I hope you have
your oven mitts on,
because I am on fire.

04:00.739 --> 04:04.009
Yeah, Maverick here
is up 22 bucks.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.911
All right, look.
You know what?
I gotta go to the bathroom.

04:05.943 --> 04:07.812
I've been standing
here for two hours.

04:07.846 --> 04:09.048
(GRUNTS)

04:09.080 --> 04:12.350
Fine. Fine, go.

04:12.383 --> 04:15.387
Uh, can we play
this one just for fun
until she gets back?

04:17.755 --> 04:19.824
Oh! Busted.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.661
Well, Cheryl, I guess
you're not any luck.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.429
Must've used it all up
when you met me.

04:23.461 --> 04:26.899
That's right, honey,
you're the jackpot that
just keeps paying off.

04:26.932 --> 04:28.000
(LAUGHING)
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

04:28.033 --> 04:29.602
That's right, sweetie.

04:29.634 --> 04:31.536
Hey. You know what
I always think is
great about Vegas?

04:31.569 --> 04:33.072
What? Fifty shrimp
for a buck?

04:33.105 --> 04:34.774
Yeah, yeah.
That. That.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.343
But also, with all
the millions of people
from around the world,

04:37.375 --> 04:39.377
Right.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.377
you can actually run
into someone you know.

04:39.411 --> 04:40.512
Oh, yeah?
Did you see somebody?

04:40.545 --> 04:43.548
Yeah, darned if it
wasn't your sister.

04:43.581 --> 04:44.584
(MOUTHING)

04:45.718 --> 04:46.852
What? She's here? What?

04:46.884 --> 04:49.055
Yeah, I was
surprised too.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.557
Oh! Look,
here's Roxanne now.

04:54.526 --> 04:58.564
Hey, Jimmy.
I see Daddy's forehead
finally came in.

05:00.432 --> 05:02.001
So did Mama's mustache.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.112 --> 05:14.879
What the hell
are you doing here?

05:14.913 --> 05:17.817
Besides stopping traffic
with a rack that
just won't quit?

05:19.785 --> 05:21.954
Cheryl called.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.954
Oh, yeah?

05:21.987 --> 05:23.956
She said you wanted
to patch things up.

05:23.988 --> 05:25.390
Well, yeah.

05:26.391 --> 05:27.726
That's great.

05:28.927 --> 05:30.730
Can I speak to you
for a second?

05:32.730 --> 05:34.533
Excuse me, Sis.

05:34.565 --> 05:35.935
We'll be
just one second.

05:38.069 --> 05:41.774
Family vacation?
I knew you had
an exterior motive.

05:41.807 --> 05:43.509
It's ulterior, Jim.

05:43.541 --> 05:46.512
Oh, yeah,
like I'm gonna believe
anything you say right now.

05:46.545 --> 05:48.414
All right, this is
why I wanted to come.

05:48.447 --> 05:50.816
But, honey,
it's just that
I care about you.

05:50.848 --> 05:53.451
Come on, it's not natural
to be cut off
from your own family.

05:53.485 --> 05:56.922
Cheryl, I cut her off
because I don't want her
anywhere near our family.

05:56.954 --> 05:58.390
I don't want...

05:56.954 --> 05:58.390
Shh.

06:02.894 --> 06:04.662
So she owes you
a little money.

06:04.696 --> 06:06.565
Oh, it's
not about that.

06:06.598 --> 06:10.569
I've forgotten about
the $4,567.19.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.073
Roxanne is not good.

06:14.105 --> 06:15.707
You've seen how
she uses people.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.442
She doesn't even
think twice about it.

06:17.475 --> 06:19.043
I know, honey.
I know it's been
that way in the past.

06:19.076 --> 06:20.112
People do change.

06:20.144 --> 06:21.813
My sister does not change.

06:21.846 --> 06:24.817
Oh, really?
You know that guy Rick?
He's out of her life.

06:24.850 --> 06:27.552
She said that the last time.
She always says that.

06:27.586 --> 06:29.655
Then the guy
running the Tilt-A-Whirl
takes off his shirt

06:29.687 --> 06:32.925
and she falls in love
all over again.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.862
Oh, he'll be
back in a second.
Just set it down, honey.

06:48.507 --> 06:50.108
Jim...

06:48.507 --> 06:50.108
What?

06:50.141 --> 06:52.711
She's never even met
Kyle, her own nephew.
Isn't that sad?

06:52.744 --> 06:54.847
Yes, it's sad.
But I don't want to
get sucked up

06:54.879 --> 06:57.216
into that screwed-up
world of hers again, ever.

06:57.249 --> 06:58.951
(GRUNTING) I want her
out of my casino.

06:58.983 --> 07:02.087
All right, all right.
Quit giving Cheryl
a hard time.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.858
Just take this.
It's for you.

07:07.259 --> 07:08.494
What's this?

07:08.526 --> 07:10.161
It's called a check.

07:10.194 --> 07:12.697
If you take it to a bank,
the nice people
turn it into money.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.800
A hundred and fifty bucks?

07:15.834 --> 07:17.603
Put it towards
what I owe you.

07:17.636 --> 07:20.005
I know it's not much,
but it's a start.

07:20.038 --> 07:22.141
Wow.

07:22.173 --> 07:24.142
You've never paid
me back for anything.

07:24.175 --> 07:25.644
Jimmy.

07:25.677 --> 07:27.480
I know you don't
believe me

07:27.512 --> 07:29.180
but I really have
turned things around.

07:29.213 --> 07:32.016
Hey, she even has her own
business here in Vegas.
Tell him, tell him.

07:32.050 --> 07:35.054
Oh, yeah,
I'm a hair stylist.

07:35.086 --> 07:36.721
I paid my way
through beauty school

07:36.754 --> 07:38.156
working as
a magician's assistant.

07:38.189 --> 07:40.459
Oh.

07:38.189 --> 07:40.459
Yeah, check it out.

07:44.629 --> 07:46.264
Okay, Roxanne, I get it.
I get it. I get it.

07:46.298 --> 07:48.199
Roxanne, I get it.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.636
Come on,
what do you say?

07:50.668 --> 07:52.837
Can I buy my big brother
a cup of coffee?

07:52.870 --> 07:54.740
Yes, he'd love it.

07:54.773 --> 07:55.775
(MOUTHING)

07:57.074 --> 07:58.810
Is that on top
of the $150?

07:58.843 --> 08:01.012
Sure, I'll let you
leave the tip.

08:02.814 --> 08:05.184
All right, Roxanne.

08:05.216 --> 08:06.618
'Cause I'd
never leave a tip.

08:06.651 --> 08:07.752
Oh...

08:10.055 --> 08:12.790
So there's this wet cement
in front of our
Uncle Paul's restaurant.

08:12.824 --> 08:14.025
Oh, please.

08:14.059 --> 08:16.996
And everybody else is
writing their names
in it with sticks.

08:17.028 --> 08:19.163
But little Jimmy here
drops trou

08:19.197 --> 08:21.800
and plants his butt cheeks
right in the middle of it.

08:21.833 --> 08:22.968
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:23.999 --> 08:24.602
You know,
he still does that

08:24.636 --> 08:26.205
with every
foundation we pour.

08:26.237 --> 08:27.973
Oh, come on.

08:28.005 --> 08:29.974
What can I say,
I like to sign my work.

08:30.007 --> 08:31.776
All right?

08:31.810 --> 08:34.613
Aunt Roxanne,
I like your nails.

08:34.645 --> 08:37.782
And I like your make-up.
You can really see it.

08:37.816 --> 08:40.152
Oh...

08:40.183 --> 08:43.955
Well, you know what?
The key is the foundation.

08:43.989 --> 08:45.958
You want to know
who gave me that tip?

08:45.990 --> 08:49.193
Barbara Mandrell.
Last time she played here.

08:49.226 --> 08:52.264
She knows Barbara Mandrell
like I know Howie Mandrell.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.336
Roxy. Roxy.

08:57.369 --> 09:00.973
Oh, hey, Wayne. Hey!

09:01.005 --> 09:04.108
Good to see you.
I just popped in for
a little key lime pie

09:04.142 --> 09:07.012
but it seems that
things have gotten
a lot sweeter.

09:07.044 --> 09:08.580
(LAUGHING) Oh, stop!

09:08.614 --> 09:10.783
Hey, everybody,
this is my friend Wayne.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.051
Hi.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.051
Hey.

09:12.083 --> 09:15.753
Oh, my God.
You're Wayne Newton.

09:15.787 --> 09:17.690
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Hi.

09:15.787 --> 09:17.690
How're you doing?

09:17.722 --> 09:19.791
Okay, you probably
don't remember this

09:19.825 --> 09:23.095
but when I was in
the fourth grade

09:25.029 --> 09:28.000
I went to see you
at Rosemont Horizon.

09:28.033 --> 09:31.169
And you looked right
out into the audience
and you said,

09:31.202 --> 09:34.839
"There's..."

09:31.202 --> 09:34.839
"There's a young lady
that's gonna grow up

09:34.873 --> 09:38.777
"and break many,
many hearts."

09:38.809 --> 09:41.112
Oh, my God.
You remember.

09:42.913 --> 09:44.283
How could I forget?

09:45.417 --> 09:47.586
I say that every show.

09:49.754 --> 09:53.258
Hey, Wayne, I want you
to meet my big brother Jim
and his family.

09:53.291 --> 09:54.760
Hey. Nice to meet you.

09:53.291 --> 09:54.760
Hi. How are you, Wayne?

09:54.793 --> 09:56.128
Hey, good to see you.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.764
Oh! This is the...
This is the butt
in the cement guy?

09:59.798 --> 10:00.966
Yeah.

09:59.798 --> 10:00.966
Yeah. That's me.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.037
Yeah, yeah, he likes to
make a good impression.

10:11.076 --> 10:13.812
My wife. Thank God
she's beautiful,
right, Wayne?

10:16.380 --> 10:20.019
And by the way,
my wife wanted me
to say thank you

10:20.052 --> 10:22.821
because she was thrilled
with the new 'do
that you gave her.

10:22.854 --> 10:24.056
Oh...

10:24.089 --> 10:25.791
Well, tell her I said <i>
 Danke Schoen.</i>

10:25.823 --> 10:28.359
(ALL LAUGHING)

10:28.393 --> 10:30.396
You're really
a special lady.
Thank you, Roxy.

10:30.428 --> 10:33.097
Wayne, your wife's already
getting a 20% discount.

10:33.130 --> 10:34.866
You can stop
kissing my butt.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.070
See you, guys.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.070
See ya.

10:38.102 --> 10:39.371
Bye.

10:38.102 --> 10:39.371
Bye-bye.

10:46.878 --> 10:51.150
You cut Wayne Newton's
wife's hair!
That is so cool.

10:51.182 --> 10:53.317
Yeah.

10:53.350 --> 10:56.087
And I'll have a lot more
high-class clients like that
once I get my chair.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.889
Your chair?

10:57.923 --> 11:00.359
Well, you have to rent
the chair space
in a hotel salon.

11:00.392 --> 11:02.361
Then you start making
the big bucks.

11:02.394 --> 11:07.265
Oh, and when I do,
I'll be sleeping late
and eating steak.

11:08.466 --> 11:10.201
Wow, you are Jim's sister.

11:10.235 --> 11:12.137
Oh, come on.

11:12.169 --> 11:15.139
Aunt Roxanne, can you
come on the roller coaster
with us?

11:15.173 --> 11:18.711
Okay, but I
gotta warn you,
I'm a screamer.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.345
Are we still talking
about the roller coaster?

11:20.378 --> 11:21.814
Hey-o!

11:24.381 --> 11:27.285
Wait a minute.
No. Jimmy, I got this.

11:29.053 --> 11:31.355
Hey... Huh?

11:31.389 --> 11:33.358
Your sister's doing
pretty well.

11:33.390 --> 11:35.059
Well, I guess so.

11:35.092 --> 11:37.995
You glad I stuck
my cute little button nose
into your business?

11:38.028 --> 11:39.264
Well...

11:39.297 --> 11:41.867
It is nice to see her,
you know, with the kids.

11:41.899 --> 11:44.736
See? You gave her a chance
and she rose to the occasion.

11:44.769 --> 11:46.904
I guess anything can happen.

11:46.937 --> 11:51.843
Got the tip, but there's
a Canadian quarter in there.
Don't tell anybody.

11:51.876 --> 11:54.045
When are you gonna
start at the salon?

11:54.078 --> 11:55.880
Well, soon, I hope.

11:55.913 --> 11:58.116
I just got to
raise $2,000.

11:59.049 --> 12:00.218
Somehow.

12:04.456 --> 12:06.859
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that, Cheryl?

12:06.892 --> 12:08.427
She was working me,
did you hear that?

12:08.460 --> 12:10.262
Honey, she didn't
ask you for anything.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.830
Oh, no, not directly.
She's too smart for that.

12:12.864 --> 12:14.533
First she gives me
a little of my money back.

12:14.566 --> 12:17.302
Gets me to trust her,
then she hits me
for the big chunk.

12:17.335 --> 12:19.905
Well, forget it,
she's not getting a dime.

12:19.937 --> 12:22.975
I am not an ATM machine.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.377
I am so embarrassed,
you guys.

12:25.409 --> 12:28.146
But I seem to have
left my wallet at home.

12:28.179 --> 12:30.114
Could I borrow five bucks
to pay for the pie?

12:30.148 --> 12:31.283
Sure.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.387
Thank you, Jim.

12:35.419 --> 12:36.521
Oh, you're welcome.

12:35.419 --> 12:36.521
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

12:36.554 --> 12:38.123
Uh-huh.

12:36.554 --> 12:38.123
Not a problem at all.

12:40.325 --> 12:42.228
What? He's good for it.

12:52.003 --> 12:53.806
(GROANS)

12:53.839 --> 12:57.075
God! I just don't get it.
I'm lucky for everybody
except me.

12:57.107 --> 12:59.510
I've been sitting here
losing for two hours.

12:59.543 --> 13:01.846
I blew my whole
unemployment check.

13:01.879 --> 13:05.216
Yeah, I'm sure those words
have never been spoken
in this room before.

13:10.388 --> 13:11.824
(BEEPING)

13:11.856 --> 13:13.091
(COINS RATTLING)

13:13.924 --> 13:15.526
(LAUGHING) Yes!

13:15.559 --> 13:18.263
Excuse me,
these cups are
for winners.

13:20.999 --> 13:25.103
Well, I'm off to get us
all tickets for the best
damn show on the Strip.

13:25.135 --> 13:26.237
What's that?

13:26.270 --> 13:28.339
Oh! It's amazing.

13:28.373 --> 13:31.310
It's <i> Samson and Delilah,</i>
it's the <i> Titanic,</i>

13:31.342 --> 13:33.544
it's the <i> History of the World,</i>

13:33.577 --> 13:35.581
as told by
50 topless women.

13:37.282 --> 13:38.517
Oh! Thanks.

13:38.549 --> 13:39.918
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

13:43.889 --> 13:44.923
(GRUNTS)

13:44.956 --> 13:46.258
Hey, how you doing?

13:46.291 --> 13:48.460
Losing!

13:46.291 --> 13:48.460
Oh.

13:48.493 --> 13:50.629
So, did you get Jim
to change his mind
about Roxanne?

13:50.662 --> 13:52.431
No, he won't budge.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.632
Maybe he's right
about her.

13:53.664 --> 13:57.068
I think he's wrong this time.
I really think she's changed.

13:57.101 --> 13:58.437
Well...

13:58.470 --> 14:01.038
You really
believe in people.

14:01.072 --> 14:02.441
I don't get that.

14:03.575 --> 14:05.610
I just wish
I could help her
get set up.

14:08.178 --> 14:09.247
(BEEPING)

14:09.280 --> 14:11.015
(COINS RATTLING)

14:11.048 --> 14:12.550
Twenty-five
hundred dollars!

14:12.583 --> 14:14.018
(EXCLAIMS)

14:14.052 --> 14:16.187
Twenty-five
hundred dollars!

14:16.221 --> 14:18.490
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:18.523 --> 14:21.326
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

14:23.595 --> 14:25.630
I couldn't be
happier for you.

14:25.663 --> 14:28.067
Look! Look! Look!

14:34.072 --> 14:36.975
Shouldn't I, like,
you know, wear
a life vest or something?

14:37.008 --> 14:39.945
The canal is only
three feet deep, <i> signor.</i>

14:39.977 --> 14:42.146
A person can drown
in an inch of water,
you know.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.218
Hey, sorry I'm late.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.218
Jim. Hey.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.985
What's with the hat?

14:48.019 --> 14:51.155
Oh, well, I thought
it might get windy
out on the water.

14:51.188 --> 14:55.192
Cheryl, we are inside
on the second floor.

14:55.225 --> 14:57.196
There's a smoke detector
in that cloud.

14:58.263 --> 14:59.531
Yeah, well,
I'm wearing a hat,

14:59.563 --> 15:01.065
you're wearing black pants
with white socks.

15:01.099 --> 15:02.434
So, let's move on.
Shall we?

15:02.466 --> 15:03.635
All right.

15:04.535 --> 15:07.538
Oh, honey, look at this.

15:07.572 --> 15:08.639
(LAUGHING)

15:08.673 --> 15:10.174
Isn't this romantic?

15:10.207 --> 15:11.943
Yes, it is.

15:10.207 --> 15:11.943
Mmm.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.611
Now we never have to
go to Europe.

15:13.644 --> 15:15.280
Yeah. Nice try.

15:13.644 --> 15:15.280
Thank you.

15:20.751 --> 15:24.121
<i> Signori,</i> it's traditional
for lovers to kiss

15:24.154 --> 15:26.524
when they go under
the Bridge of Sighs.

15:26.557 --> 15:28.927
Well, I don't wanna
mess with tradition.

15:30.662 --> 15:32.364
Hello?

15:32.397 --> 15:33.498
Oh. Hey, sweetie.

15:33.530 --> 15:34.699
Oh. Oh. No...

15:37.668 --> 15:39.170
Whoa!

15:39.203 --> 15:40.371
We'll never get
under that bridge
with that hair.

15:40.404 --> 15:41.572
Oh...

15:42.706 --> 15:44.275
Wait, hold it.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.311
Did Roxanne do that?

15:46.344 --> 15:47.479
Yeah.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.013
She just wanted to do
something nice for me.

15:49.047 --> 15:51.516
Oh, yeah?
Why would she want
to do that, Cheryl?

15:51.548 --> 15:53.184
Did you do
something nice
for her?

15:53.217 --> 15:54.285
Honey, I mean...

15:53.217 --> 15:54.285
Huh?

15:55.253 --> 15:58.256
All right,
I won $2,500
at the slots

15:58.288 --> 16:00.658
and I gave
2,000 of it to her
for the chair.

16:00.692 --> 16:03.595
What? Are you nuts?
How could you do that?

16:00.692 --> 16:03.595
What?

16:03.628 --> 16:05.397
I wanted her
to have it.

16:05.429 --> 16:07.098
I don't care,
you don't get
involved in that.

16:07.131 --> 16:08.265
Why?

16:08.298 --> 16:09.500
Because she's
my sister, not yours.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.068
Well, she's
my sister-in-law.

16:11.101 --> 16:12.770
Oh, I don't care
what she is to you.

16:12.803 --> 16:15.139
You don't do that!

16:12.803 --> 16:15.139
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

16:15.173 --> 16:17.576
Because I already
gave her the $2,000.

16:19.744 --> 16:21.613
Wow...

16:21.645 --> 16:23.448
At least I got
a hairdo out of it.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.363
You know what
I'd like to see in
one of these shows?

16:38.395 --> 16:39.630
What?

16:39.663 --> 16:41.566
Emmanuel Lewis getting
shot out of a cannon.

16:41.599 --> 16:42.768
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:45.470 --> 16:48.540
Oh, hey, Jimmy,
I'll be with you
in a second.

16:48.572 --> 16:51.143
Why don't you just grab
a <i> National Geographic?</i>

16:51.176 --> 16:54.211
The one on the bottom
has native girls in it.

16:54.245 --> 16:56.447
You know what?
I don't even care about
naked women right now.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.182
That ought to tell you
how mad I am.

16:59.683 --> 17:01.620
So I guess Cheryl told you
how she gave me the money.

17:01.653 --> 17:02.988
Yeah.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.790
And I noticed you didn't
tell her how I gave you
the $2,000 already.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.259
Did you?

17:07.290 --> 17:09.326
You made me promise
not to tell her.

17:09.358 --> 17:10.428
I was gonna give it back.

17:10.461 --> 17:12.431
Oh, right, Roxanne.

17:12.463 --> 17:18.102
Oh, here we go.
I'm the screw-up
who always screws up.

17:19.368 --> 17:20.804
Nobody ever believes me.

17:20.837 --> 17:23.307
Oh, come on, Roxanne,
you know, that little act
might've worked with Daddy

17:23.339 --> 17:25.076
but it won't work with me.

17:25.108 --> 17:26.676
Oh.

17:26.711 --> 17:28.747
Well, why don't you
just shut up and look
on the counter?

17:28.779 --> 17:30.415
Right there
in that envelope.

17:31.749 --> 17:33.085
There's two grand in there.

17:33.117 --> 17:34.485
Ouch!

17:34.519 --> 17:36.654
What do you want, honey?
You got a lot of knots.

17:38.589 --> 17:39.757
You are so full of it.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.492
The only reason you're
giving me this money

17:41.526 --> 17:44.496
is because
I caught you in a lie.

17:44.528 --> 17:46.464
Oh. Is that
what you think?

17:46.498 --> 17:48.432
That's right, Roxanne.

17:48.465 --> 17:51.803
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna give you
Cheryl's money too.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.109
You know what?
I'll take it.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.517
Well, just tell me something.
Why did you give me the money
in the first place?

18:05.549 --> 18:07.184
You know what?
I don't know.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.622
Maybe because I still had hope
that I was wrong about you.
But you know what? I wasn't.

18:10.654 --> 18:11.956
You love this.

18:11.990 --> 18:15.626
As long as I'm the loser,
you get to be the big hero
of the family.

18:15.660 --> 18:19.598
With your marriage
and your job
and your house.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.333
Hey, everybody,
look at me!

18:21.365 --> 18:24.269
I'm Jim! I've
never been to rehab!

18:25.769 --> 18:27.905
All right, all right.
Turn it on me.

18:27.939 --> 18:30.509
All right, but I'm done
cleaning up your messes.

18:32.844 --> 18:34.712
You better not be
lying about this.

18:39.616 --> 18:44.623
Oh, boy, $2,500
burning a hole
in my pocket.

18:44.655 --> 18:48.225
I'm thinking
flat-screen TV
in the bathroom.

18:48.259 --> 18:49.560
Yeah.

18:49.594 --> 18:51.630
Or we could blow it
on something stupid.

18:51.663 --> 18:52.698
(LAUGHS)

18:53.565 --> 18:54.900
Yeah, we could.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.204
Stop. Is that
who I think it is?

19:00.704 --> 19:02.441
You've got to
be kidding me.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.379
Roxanne. Roxanne.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.481
What're you doing here?
I thought you didn't have
the money to do this.

19:10.515 --> 19:11.816
Well, now I do.

19:11.848 --> 19:13.317
What did you do?
Rob a bank?

19:13.351 --> 19:15.887
No, I got the money
from my new boyfriend.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.590
What did he do?
Rob a bank?

19:18.623 --> 19:22.693
No, he's a great guy.
He's warm and nice.

19:22.727 --> 19:24.863
And unlike you,
he happens to
believe in me.

19:27.265 --> 19:29.234
Hi, darling!

19:29.267 --> 19:30.568
Hello, butter muffin.

19:30.602 --> 19:31.870
(CHUCKLES)

19:39.309 --> 19:41.946
Just ruined butter
and muffins for me.

19:39.309 --> 19:41.946
Yeah.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.222
JIM: <i> Next time on</i>
According to Jim.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.357
Yeah, Andy,
I gotta talk to you...

19:52.391 --> 19:55.759
Oh, Jim. I know
what you're gonna say
and don't worry.

19:55.792 --> 19:58.362
The Andy-man
can handle himself.

19:58.395 --> 19:59.597
Of course,
I don't have to,

19:59.631 --> 20:00.932
now that I'm dating
your sister.

20:00.964 --> 20:02.333
You gotta dump her.

20:02.366 --> 20:05.403
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

20:05.435 --> 20:06.904
(WEDDING MUSIC PLAYING)

20:06.938 --> 20:08.406
(GROANS) Oh!

20:08.439 --> 20:09.740
Where's my sister?

20:09.773 --> 20:12.910
You mean my wife?
She's sleeping in.

20:12.943 --> 20:15.614
Had her up pretty late
last night.

20:16.413 --> 20:17.516
(DRUM SOLO PLAYING)

20:27.759 --> 20:31.796
I've made
my decision. Okay?
Roxanne is my wife.

20:31.828 --> 20:35.267
Now you two need to decide
if you want to be
in or out of our lives.

20:35.299 --> 20:37.269
Does that sound like
a patsy to you?

20:37.301 --> 20:39.270
Hell, no.

20:39.304 --> 20:40.971
(CAR HORN HONKS)

20:39.304 --> 20:40.971
You know what?
I gotta go.

20:41.005 --> 20:42.607
(STAMMERING) Whoa, wait.
You're not going anywhere

20:42.640 --> 20:45.810
until you tell Andy
exactly what you're doing.

20:45.843 --> 20:50.515
Could you tell him?
See, we're not
really that close.

20:50.548 --> 20:53.484
I have nothing
to live for.
I'm a cuckold!

20:53.518 --> 20:55.420
Yes, a cuckold!
We're all cuckolds

20:55.452 --> 20:58.656
if we don't have
Fab-U-Foam insulation.

20:55.452 --> 20:58.656
Jim, the hose!

20:58.690 --> 21:00.424
What? The Hose?

21:00.458 --> 21:01.593
Andy! Andy! The hose!

21:02.305 --> 21:08.488
