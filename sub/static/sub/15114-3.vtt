We'd be crazy not to squeeze
it for all it's worth.

call me two weeks ago from Arizona?

- Sabbatical or exile, Dr. Harris?

00:42.339 --> 00:44.106

We can talk off the record, I hope?

00:55.186 --> 00:58.088
Do you know anything about
Kane seeing a Dr. Ella Harris?

00:58.122 --> 01:00.090
I don't understand.
Are you saying he's sick?

01:00.124 --> 01:03.627
Muscle rigidity, whole-body
tremors... it's progressing.

- Boss?

01:06.731 --> 01:08.366
Dr. Harris:
<i>Mr. Mayor, you have to know</i>

01:08.400 --> 01:10.501
your best days are behind you.

01:10.536 --> 01:13.871
Mayor Kane cannot have
such unchecked power.

the wherewithal to make it.

01:20.346 --> 01:23.982

Motion to vote.

There's a community there,

of administrative blunders.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.992
It won't go away with
an architectural face-lift.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.328
I wanna make sure
this project turns out right.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.897
- Perhaps you should come work for me.
- What?

01:37.931 --> 01:42.669
- Tom?
- Who let him in to see my wife before I do?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.537
Ian: <i>I spoke with the
warden and parole board</i>

05:34.239 --> 05:36.140
Hopefully you won't have
to wear it much longer.

05:36.175 --> 05:39.777
- How's Mrs. Kane feeling?
- Improved.

05:39.812 --> 05:42.146
- Budget projections.
- On your desk.

05:42.181 --> 05:44.549
- My daughter?
- The sheriff will drop her off at 7:00.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.084
I've cleared your evening.

05:46.118 --> 05:48.119
She's been authorized for
visits to her NA meetings

05:48.153 --> 05:49.787
and I've emailed you
the contact information

05:49.822 --> 05:51.856
of her parole officer Dave Hoffman.

05:51.890 --> 05:53.858
I thought you might like
to speak with him personally.

05:53.892 --> 05:55.460
He'll be in charge of her monthly tests.

05:55.494 --> 05:57.495
When can I expect to hear from
the Superintendent of Police?

05:57.529 --> 05:59.931
- Man: Morning, Mr. Mayor.
- It appears the Cook County State's Attorney

05:59.965 --> 06:02.700
will be point on the shooting
investigation, given its high profile.

06:02.734 --> 06:04.368
Doyle.
When's he coming?

06:04.403 --> 06:05.903
He said he's available
later this afternoon,

06:05.938 --> 06:07.505
but would prefer to meet at his office.

06:07.539 --> 06:08.973
( Chuckles )

06:09.008 --> 06:11.976
Here.
( Laughing )

06:12.010 --> 06:13.578
10 minutes.

06:14.847 --> 06:16.481
Doyle:
<i>"You're a disease.</i>

06:16.515 --> 06:19.584
If I see you on the street,
I will fuck you up.

06:19.618 --> 06:22.321
<i>I will fuck your daughter.</i>
<i>I will fuck your wife."</i>

06:22.355 --> 06:25.424
So you have reason to believe

06:25.458 --> 06:27.026
that she might have been the target?

06:27.060 --> 06:29.662
Not yet, no.
It's possible, though.

06:29.696 --> 06:33.399
"You're a parasite of lies
and I am your worst enemy."

06:36.003 --> 06:37.603
Hundreds of these.

06:37.638 --> 06:40.539
And all have been dealt with
by the proper authorities.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.341
So unless you're telling me
that you have proof

06:42.376 --> 06:44.143
that one of those troglodytes shot my wife,

06:44.178 --> 06:46.813
I implore you to get to your point, Jeff.

06:46.847 --> 06:48.581
My point, Tom,

06:48.615 --> 06:51.017
is that you're not exactly
short on enemies.

06:51.051 --> 06:53.153
There was a time, was there not,

06:53.187 --> 06:54.888
when I could count you among them?

06:55.422 --> 06:57.491
You were cleared.

06:57.525 --> 07:00.194
I repent.
I've moved on.

07:00.228 --> 07:01.629
Have you?

07:02.831 --> 07:05.032
The ultimate objective here

07:05.067 --> 07:08.002
isn't merely prosecution, it's conviction.

07:08.037 --> 07:10.771
Whoever did this cannot, on my watch,

07:10.806 --> 07:12.573
get off on a technicality.

07:12.608 --> 07:16.978
- Time must be taken...
- My wife nearly died.

07:17.013 --> 07:19.347
<i>And while she relearns how to breathe,</i>

07:19.382 --> 07:21.749
I'm a prisoner in my own home,

07:21.784 --> 07:23.718
shuttled to work every day by armed guards,

07:23.753 --> 07:25.954
strapped into a vise every
time I wanna step outside,

07:25.988 --> 07:27.455

07:27.490 --> 07:30.492
<i>reciting the ramblings of the deranged.</i>

07:30.526 --> 07:32.928
Why hasn't the shooter been found?

07:32.962 --> 07:34.630
Lack of physical evidence at the scene

07:34.664 --> 07:37.500
and the inordinate number of
people who hate you personally

07:37.534 --> 07:39.435
or hate what you do politically.

07:41.071 --> 07:45.575
We're exploring all we can
as quickly as we can.

07:45.609 --> 07:48.979
<i>That said, if there is anything
that could have bearing...</i>

07:49.013 --> 07:52.115
moves you've made, conflicts,
entanglements... it would help to hear them.

07:53.284 --> 07:58.988
Conflicts,
entanglements, moves...

07:59.022 --> 08:01.891
you've just described my job.

08:01.926 --> 08:04.828
And in 20 years, no one's
ever shot at me for it.

08:04.862 --> 08:08.731
Well, now someone has.

I don't anticipate any hardball questions
coming to you, but if they do...

09:00.683 --> 09:03.184
I pivot back to you...
strength, character, courage.

09:03.219 --> 09:05.820
Relax, Ben.
We've been here before.

09:05.854 --> 09:09.257
- This is national.
- It's still a camera.

09:11.261 --> 09:12.861
You think the kids are up for this?

09:12.896 --> 09:15.664
They're the whole reason
we're doing it here.

09:15.698 --> 09:17.799
Do we really need
to go over all this again?

09:18.801 --> 09:20.302
No.

09:21.638 --> 09:23.305
You look beautiful.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.411
Treasurer, Mrs. Zajac.
I'm Sandra Klein.

- Sandra. Ben, please.
- Maggie.

09:31.715 --> 09:33.883
- I love that suit.
- Thank you.

09:33.917 --> 09:36.152
You look great.
You feeling okay?

09:36.186 --> 09:38.020
I hope this hasn't been too disruptive.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.022
Well, I admit I was a little resistant

09:40.057 --> 09:42.225
to having my home taken over,
but it's been pretty painless.

09:42.259 --> 09:43.559
<i>I'm glad to hear it.</i>

09:43.594 --> 09:45.494
So, we'll start with the two of you,

09:45.529 --> 09:48.197
- then cut and bring in the kids.
- Sounds good.

09:48.232 --> 09:50.900
Maggie, can you talk about
what you were feeling

09:50.934 --> 09:52.568
in the moments surrounding the shooting?

09:53.602 --> 09:57.373
You can't really put it
into words, the feelings.

09:57.408 --> 09:59.842
It all happened so quickly.

09:59.877 --> 10:02.311
I heard a crack.

10:02.346 --> 10:03.813
Mrs. Kane fell,

10:03.847 --> 10:06.582
and then Ben was on top of me.

10:06.617 --> 10:08.651
Sandra: <i>Did he say anything?
Do you remember?</i>

10:11.122 --> 10:12.855

"You're safe."

10:14.592 --> 10:16.092
"You're safe."

10:18.095 --> 10:20.362
- Sorry.
- Sandra: <i>Don't be sorry.</i>

10:20.396 --> 10:23.399
- Do you need a minute?
- No.

- She out.

11:39.107 --> 11:41.442
She didn't call you?

11:41.477 --> 11:43.077
Pssh.

11:43.112 --> 11:46.647
I mean, you know,
she not exactly reachable.

11:46.681 --> 11:49.016
Man, man...

What the fuck you done
got yourself into now?

11:55.324 --> 11:57.992
I just need a place to crash.
That's all, man.

12:02.330 --> 12:05.900
- And this is with, what, 20% Section Eight?
- <i>( TV playing )</i>

12:05.934 --> 12:09.670
- 15.
- We need to look at upping subsidized housing to 25%.

12:09.704 --> 12:12.840
- If we tie it to a work requirement...
- That's not viable.

12:12.874 --> 12:15.342
25 triggers additional funding from HUD.

12:15.377 --> 12:17.244
<i>That coupled with additional</i>
<i>cost-cutting measures...</i>

12:17.279 --> 12:18.946
Ian: <i>The number McGantry</i>
<i>came in with is reasonable.</i>

12:18.980 --> 12:20.347
And that conclusion's based on?

12:20.382 --> 12:22.950
This report from the Community
Development Commission

12:22.984 --> 12:25.753
and this one here from City Planning.

12:25.787 --> 12:30.757
Sir, there's no reason not to move
ahead with the proposal as is.

12:30.792 --> 12:34.794
"Nothing is irreparable except a willing
capitulation to the status quo."

12:34.829 --> 12:36.997
Your words, sir.

12:37.031 --> 12:39.199
And this is exactly that.

12:39.233 --> 12:41.201
Now, if you wanna go that way, fine,

12:41.235 --> 12:44.438
but then I can't see
any reason for me to be here.

12:46.941 --> 12:48.409
Your alternative?

12:48.443 --> 12:50.711
<i>Open up the project to competitive bids.</i>

12:50.745 --> 12:52.780
Make it clear to the usual suspects

12:52.814 --> 12:55.449
there will be no skim,
no graft, no ghost hires,

12:55.484 --> 12:58.719
then use the savings
to better the community...

12:58.754 --> 13:01.689
a health clinic, a technology center.

13:01.723 --> 13:03.524
There's no tax revenue in a health clinic.

13:03.559 --> 13:05.159
And what's the point in rehabbing the place

13:05.194 --> 13:08.029
if it's just gonna stay
a ghetto for poor people?

13:08.063 --> 13:10.631
These sorts of projects
raise people out of poverty,

13:10.666 --> 13:12.600
which broadens the tax base.

13:12.634 --> 13:14.869
Competitive bidding is a declaration
of war against McGantry,

13:14.903 --> 13:18.205
who just happens to be the single
largest contributor to the mayor's PAC.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.873
And those usual suspects?

13:19.907 --> 13:22.509
They're the same people pulling
votes for us on election day.

13:22.544 --> 13:24.612
You think they do that out of
the goodness of their hearts?

13:24.646 --> 13:26.113
Thanks for that.

13:26.147 --> 13:27.214
Maybe when we're through here,

13:27.249 --> 13:29.350
you can explain
how to play Tic-tac-toe.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.852
Sir, displacing the residents
of Lennox Gardens

13:31.887 --> 13:35.823
will affect your support in the
African-American community across the board.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.559
And votes aside, the city's budget
has been running at a deficit

13:39.594 --> 13:42.295
for near a decade now because
of projects like this one.

13:42.330 --> 13:44.030
Something has to give.

13:44.064 --> 13:45.665
I'm not suggesting that we open

13:45.699 --> 13:47.600
all projects citywide to this process.

13:47.634 --> 13:49.469
I'm talking about one project,

13:49.503 --> 13:51.204
doing this one thing differently.

13:51.238 --> 13:54.340
And if it works, maybe you've
got a new way forward.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.877
<i>( TV continues )</i>

13:56.911 --> 13:59.278
- <i>( Volume increases )</i>
- Sandra: <i>Do you remember what ran through your mind</i>

13:59.313 --> 14:00.847
<i>in the moment you heard the shots?</i>

14:00.881 --> 14:05.518
I can't say there was
much thought involved.

14:06.754 --> 14:10.723
It was a gut instinct,
really, to protect my wife.

14:10.758 --> 14:12.058
- <i>( TV turns off )</i>
- <i>( Remote clatters )</i>

14:12.092 --> 14:14.728
Is there some misunderstanding
about this campaign?

14:14.762 --> 14:17.997
Some belief that it actually
bears autonomy?

14:18.032 --> 14:20.200
- No, sir.
- Good.

14:21.702 --> 14:23.737
I'll talk with McGantry
about cutting costs.

14:23.771 --> 14:27.941
In the meantime, bump up
Section Eight to 25%,

14:27.975 --> 14:29.943
see what that gets us.

14:30.945 --> 14:32.813
Yes, sir.

14:44.893 --> 14:46.560
Hey.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.329
Hey.

14:53.702 --> 14:57.105
You look good, relaxed.

15:02.278 --> 15:05.880
So, look, I'm...

15:05.914 --> 15:09.284
I have a lot that I need to apologize for,

15:09.318 --> 15:13.321
and I'm grateful you're
giving me a chance to...

15:13.356 --> 15:15.157
What do you want, Ben?

15:24.267 --> 15:26.835
I want you back.

15:27.369 --> 15:30.172
Rick knows the drill.
You'll be fine.

15:31.908 --> 15:33.942
I fired him.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.811
The guy's got his head up his ass.

15:35.845 --> 15:37.913
No idea how to run a competitive race.

15:37.947 --> 15:40.782
- <i>Have you been watching the numbers?</i>
- No.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.718
Mm.

15:42.752 --> 15:45.354
Walsh is making a play for Cook County.

15:45.388 --> 15:47.556
Twice as many events in town
in the last few weeks

15:47.591 --> 15:50.192
than the whole of her last run.

15:50.227 --> 15:51.827
She's within five.

15:53.397 --> 15:55.197
I'm out of the game.

15:57.167 --> 15:59.502
You're quitting?

15:59.536 --> 16:02.338
Everything?

16:02.372 --> 16:04.207
I don't believe you.

16:06.944 --> 16:08.411
Believe what you want.

16:13.117 --> 16:16.886
Yeah, there's no way you'd walk away.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.821
It's who you are.

16:22.059 --> 16:24.894
How are your kids?

16:24.928 --> 16:26.462
<i>They're fine.</i>

16:26.497 --> 16:28.731
They're great, actually.

16:33.304 --> 16:35.171
Come on.

16:38.943 --> 16:40.977
You can't tell me you don't miss it.

16:43.848 --> 16:45.582
Don't call me again.

16:59.764 --> 17:03.466
It's been awfully quiet
without you at home.

17:03.500 --> 17:08.238
It'll be nice to have
some life in the house again.

17:08.271 --> 17:10.874
How was the meeting with Doyle?

17:10.909 --> 17:13.077
<i>No need to concern yourself about that.</i>

17:13.111 --> 17:15.713
Just focus on getting better.

17:15.747 --> 17:17.915
Any idea who the shooter is?

17:17.949 --> 17:19.450
No, not really.

17:21.085 --> 17:24.555
It's not likely that you were the target.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.123
You're safe here.

17:29.727 --> 17:32.296
- And you?
- Just a precaution.

17:32.330 --> 17:34.898
They've stepped up my security.

17:34.933 --> 17:36.834
No need to worry about me.

17:39.138 --> 17:41.907
- How can I not?
- I'm fine.

17:44.410 --> 17:46.144
Emma's coming home tonight.

17:46.179 --> 17:49.115
I've arranged for house arrest.

17:49.149 --> 17:52.084
- ( Grunts )
- Putting her in her old room.

17:52.118 --> 17:54.720
When was this decision made?

17:56.556 --> 17:58.890
You'll need help when you return.

17:58.925 --> 18:01.192
She can provide that for you.

18:01.227 --> 18:03.561
Giving her an opportunity
to contribute to the family

18:03.595 --> 18:06.397
could be a good thing for all of us.

18:08.166 --> 18:11.101
I'd suggest

18:11.135 --> 18:14.337
you temper your expectations, Tom...

18:15.973 --> 18:18.408
<i>about everything.</i>

19:18.701 --> 19:20.436
Emma...

19:25.608 --> 19:27.609
Thank you.

19:59.273 --> 20:02.108

- <i>( Glass shatters )</i>

20:10.618 --> 20:12.753
( Sighs )

20:15.323 --> 20:18.158
Well, somebody has to have
an in at Doyle's office.

20:18.193 --> 20:20.027
- Yeah?
- I need your okay.

20:20.061 --> 20:21.929
- What?
- Garfield Ridge community meeting

20:21.963 --> 20:23.564
on the Lennox Gardens relocation.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.766
Yeah?
This my only option?

20:25.800 --> 20:28.035
No, but that's the best one.

20:29.871 --> 20:32.072
- <i>( Knocking at door )</i>
- Yeah.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.408
CPD released the file
on Ezra Stone's murder.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.011
- Well, it's about damn time.
- Man: <i>Can I get a yea or nay on this</i>

20:37.045 --> 20:38.546
before you fall down the rabbit hole again?

20:38.580 --> 20:40.582
Yeah. Sorry.
Wait, hold on.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.551
Is this even the same meeting?

20:42.585 --> 20:45.420
- Same neighborhood.
- Oh, you're killing me.

20:45.455 --> 20:48.724
- Go with Driscoll.
- You sure don't like selling newspapers, do you?

20:48.758 --> 20:51.660
Fine. Fuck.
Use the screamer.

20:51.695 --> 20:53.662
- Get out.
- Forced entry.

20:53.697 --> 20:56.598
Place was ransacked,
showed signs of a struggle.

20:56.633 --> 20:58.334
Shocker of all shockers...

20:58.368 --> 21:00.202
looks like it's a botched burglary.

21:01.772 --> 21:03.773
<i>( TV playing )</i>

21:11.715 --> 21:13.716
<i>( Changing channels )</i>

21:30.034 --> 21:32.602

21:45.215 --> 21:47.717
Honey?

21:47.751 --> 21:49.785
I answered your phone by mistake.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.587
- Sorry about that.
- Who is it?

21:51.621 --> 21:53.756
She wouldn't say.
She has an accent, though.

22:00.697 --> 22:02.765
This is Kitty.

22:06.203 --> 22:07.670
How's our girl?

22:07.704 --> 22:10.807
On her feet.
She'll be home soon.

22:10.842 --> 22:13.210
I miss our meals together.

22:13.744 --> 22:15.246
I'd like you to take a look at the numbers

22:15.280 --> 22:16.981
on the Lennox Gardens project.

22:17.015 --> 22:18.717
Your proposal.

22:20.052 --> 22:23.255
Why don't we get right down to it, then?

22:23.289 --> 22:25.557
It's a little higher than
it needs to be right now.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.594
I wasn't aware it differed that greatly

22:28.628 --> 22:32.131
from any previous proposal we've
ever submitted to your office.

22:32.165 --> 22:34.667
<i>Which is the problem.</i>

22:34.701 --> 22:36.902
We hire the subcontractors you tell us to.

22:36.937 --> 22:38.570
Maybe you should take this up with them.

22:38.605 --> 22:40.239
I will.

22:40.273 --> 22:43.742
But let's not pretend that your
costs aren't inflated as well.

22:43.776 --> 22:45.977
Wouldn't dream of it.

22:46.012 --> 22:49.247
Listen, I'm sure we can find
an acceptable compromise.

22:49.281 --> 22:54.319
Say, instead of cost plus 50,
maybe cost plus 20?

22:54.353 --> 22:56.888
<i>You know, I've always admired your ability</i>

22:56.923 --> 22:59.724
to separate the business from the personal.

23:00.759 --> 23:02.293
This isn't.

23:02.328 --> 23:04.428
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

23:04.463 --> 23:06.764
It would be unfortunate if our symbiosis

23:06.798 --> 23:10.133
were threatened by petty matters, no?

23:10.168 --> 23:12.135
Unfortunate indeed.

23:13.337 --> 23:14.938
Excuse me for a minute.

23:47.107 --> 23:49.575
Sir, I don't mean to bother you.

23:49.610 --> 23:51.577
I just wanted to say we're real happy

23:51.612 --> 23:53.279
that Mrs. Kane is going
to be all right.

23:53.313 --> 23:55.081
We were all praying for her.

23:55.115 --> 23:56.950
Thank you.
That's very kind.

23:56.984 --> 23:59.585
I'd shake your hand
if... but...

23:59.619 --> 24:00.820
- Right.
- Good luck to you.

24:00.854 --> 24:02.621
You, too.

24:14.767 --> 24:17.101
Did you get it out?

24:17.135 --> 24:19.570
Look, I'd rather it not come to this,

24:19.604 --> 24:21.906
but if you're unwilling to work with me,

24:21.940 --> 24:24.408
I can open up the process
to competitive bids.

24:24.443 --> 24:26.911
So, this is about the reelect?

24:26.945 --> 24:29.846
It's about a new approach to a unique case.

24:29.881 --> 24:32.249
It's a run-down
housing project, Tom.

24:32.283 --> 24:35.551
I hope this isn't some posttraumatic
search for absolution.

24:35.585 --> 24:38.820
The riots in the Gardens were a tragedy,

24:38.855 --> 24:40.355
but they were 20 years ago.

24:40.389 --> 24:42.224
I need a lower number.

24:44.060 --> 24:46.528
I'll have my guys take a look at it,

24:46.563 --> 24:48.397
see if they can work something out.

coming down without a fight.

25:24.935 --> 25:27.370
It's gonna get ugly.

25:27.405 --> 25:29.973
Too many people got too much to lose.

25:30.007 --> 25:33.576
But you know all about that, don't you?

25:33.611 --> 25:36.045
You know what I know?

25:36.080 --> 25:38.515
You and Kane are cut from the same cloth.

25:38.549 --> 25:42.018
<i>Only real difference... you're
powerless to get a damn thing done.</i>

26:24.863 --> 26:26.364
Welcome home.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.134
Yeah, you're welcome.
She's all yours.

26:30.168 --> 26:32.169
Lock up.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.394
How was lunch?

26:57.428 --> 26:58.896
Sorry?

26:58.930 --> 27:01.298
Competitive bids.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.167
How long will it take?

27:05.404 --> 27:07.472
Ian on computer: <i>I can pull together</i>
<i>a list of development firms,</i>

Too much work for one person.

27:10.510 --> 27:11.777
Might as well divide and conquer.

27:11.812 --> 27:14.647
- I said I've got it.
- Look, I can be an asset here.

27:14.681 --> 27:17.350
I spent two years with Ted Schachter

I've seen your resume.

27:18.886 --> 27:21.454
<i>If I'm being kind, it seemed embellished.</i>

27:21.488 --> 27:25.459
And speaking of Driscoll, she's all
over my call sheet and the mayor's.

27:25.493 --> 27:29.262
If you're not gonna sack up and
tell her yourself, I'll have to.

27:29.296 --> 27:31.497
Please excuse me.

27:48.782 --> 27:51.250
- <i>( Door closes )</i>
- Sorry about the logistics of the meet.

- You know how the trail can be.
- Not a problem.

27:53.386 --> 27:57.223
- Kitty, thank you so much for taking the time.
- Senator.

27:57.257 --> 27:59.759
- Anything else you need, ma'am?
- No, thank you, Gwendie.

27:59.793 --> 28:02.162
Have a seat.

28:02.196 --> 28:03.663
( Sighs )

28:03.698 --> 28:06.533
So, she's headed back to Springfield

28:06.568 --> 28:08.302
to manage my Senate seat,

28:08.336 --> 28:11.138
and I need some heavy hitters
out here on the trail.

28:11.672 --> 28:14.074
Okay, just to be clear with you,

28:14.109 --> 28:17.278
I'm not interested in providing oppo
research for you or anyone else.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.149
I don't know what happened
with Kane, and I don't care.

28:22.184 --> 28:24.118
Your past has no bearing here.

28:25.420 --> 28:28.055
Right, but my crossing the aisle

28:28.090 --> 28:29.891
would be political suicide.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.859
Let's be frank.

28:31.894 --> 28:35.897
Social issues aside, it's pretty much
a race to the middle these days.

28:35.931 --> 28:39.233
I'm confident any ideological
concerns you may have

28:39.268 --> 28:41.802
can be worked out
to our mutual satisfaction,

28:41.837 --> 28:46.740
because unlike most men I
know, I'm open to new ideas.

28:46.775 --> 28:49.443
You just need a fresh start, Kitty.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.111
I'm offering you parity.

28:52.113 --> 28:54.314
This is a team, not a fiefdom.

28:54.349 --> 28:57.317
You'd be a partner, not a servant.

29:00.555 --> 29:02.356
Just tell me you'll consider it.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.307
He had his checkup.
The doctor's waiting for you.

29:22.243 --> 29:23.744
Thanks.

29:43.732 --> 29:45.333
Take a deep breath.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.336
( Breathing deeply )

29:58.513 --> 30:01.282
How've you been feeling?

30:01.316 --> 30:03.251
Well, considering.

30:04.285 --> 30:05.587
Any physical symptoms?

30:05.621 --> 30:07.855
Tremors?
Muscle rigidity?

30:07.890 --> 30:09.624
Not since that night at the hospital.

30:09.658 --> 30:11.326
When you skipped a dose?

30:12.360 --> 30:13.929
Yeah.

Well, that's good news.

30:15.631 --> 30:18.400
Stress tends to exacerbate the symptoms,

30:18.434 --> 30:21.436
but I'm glad to know we're keeping
them at bay at this dosage level.

30:21.971 --> 30:24.172
- And what about your personality?
- ( Slurping )

30:24.207 --> 30:25.674
Any shifts?

30:25.708 --> 30:27.742
Usually I'd speak to
family members about this,

30:27.777 --> 30:29.311
but under the circumstances...

30:29.345 --> 30:32.214
Yeah, hardly the proper time to gauge

30:32.248 --> 30:34.816
that particular symptom, don't you think?

30:35.885 --> 30:38.853
- Still.
- ( Slurping )

30:41.924 --> 30:43.758
Same old prick I've always been.

30:44.293 --> 30:46.528
Any hallucinations?

30:47.562 --> 30:49.331
As a matter of fact...

30:49.365 --> 30:50.899
- You're having one now?
- ( Slurping )

30:52.468 --> 30:53.802
Pardon?

30:55.004 --> 30:56.605
Auditory or visual?

30:56.639 --> 30:59.408
( Slurping )

31:00.710 --> 31:02.410
Both.

31:04.680 --> 31:08.149
Do you feel they're hindering
your ability to function?

31:08.183 --> 31:10.551
Tell her the truth, Tom.

31:10.586 --> 31:13.020
You're losing your damn mind.

31:15.891 --> 31:17.892
Nothing I can't handle.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.167
Ian: <i>I'm not here to make</i>
<i>your life difficult.</i>

31:26.201 --> 31:28.202
- Yeah? Then why are you here?
- Mayor Kane has concerns.

31:28.237 --> 31:30.705
- I'm here to express them.
- Yeah, and you've done that.

31:30.739 --> 31:32.240
So what now?

31:32.274 --> 31:33.875
I'm supposed to clear
every word through you?

31:33.909 --> 31:35.443
You are.

31:35.478 --> 31:38.313
( Scoffs ) This is insane.

31:38.347 --> 31:40.282
I'm not sure how things
worked with my predecessor,

31:40.316 --> 31:42.117
but my voice is the voice of the mayor.

31:42.152 --> 31:44.286
- Wow.
- I'm sure we can come to some sort of compromise.

31:44.321 --> 31:45.888
There's none to be had.

31:45.922 --> 31:48.157
The mayor's support is
contingent on this new protocol.

31:48.191 --> 31:51.060
What does he expect?
I've been iced out since the primary.

31:51.095 --> 31:53.896
Then we get traction and you waltz
in here with your fucking protocol?

31:53.931 --> 31:56.332
I have a race to win.
I don't have time for this shit.

31:56.366 --> 31:58.234
Kane's gotta make up
his damn mind... in or out.

31:58.268 --> 32:00.169
This after-the-fact bullshit...
this isn't gonna fly.

32:00.203 --> 32:01.903
I think what Ben means to say

32:01.938 --> 32:03.805
is that we are grateful
for the mayor's support.

32:03.839 --> 32:07.142
Whatever we can do to further
his agenda, we are happy to do.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.444
Ben spent a fair amount of
time at the Housing Authority.

32:09.478 --> 32:11.079
- Maybe he can be useful...
- I'm sorry.

32:11.113 --> 32:13.248
I'm not clear what you have
to do with any of this.

32:13.282 --> 32:15.750
She's my campaign manager, and you're
gonna deal with her from now on.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.487
If you'll excuse us.

32:22.757 --> 32:24.892
Apologies.
I wasn't aware.

32:24.926 --> 32:26.994
None necessary.

32:28.464 --> 32:30.665
- Ian: We'll be in touch.
- Mm-hmm.

32:38.275 --> 32:39.910
Are you sure?

32:42.346 --> 32:44.047
You don't want the job?

32:45.249 --> 32:46.817
Fuck, it's us against the world.

32:46.851 --> 32:48.519
We might as well make it official, right?

32:58.062 --> 32:59.496
I'm gonna tuck the kids in.

32:59.531 --> 33:02.333
You've got fund-raising
calls to make.

33:18.250 --> 33:19.751
Mona:
<i>This is the most promising...</i>

33:19.785 --> 33:21.252
Young and Mortensen.

33:21.286 --> 33:22.653
In addition to all the requirements,

33:22.688 --> 33:24.989
they've included Silver Level
LEED certification.

33:25.024 --> 33:27.625
- What about McGantry?
- Nothing new from them yet.

33:27.660 --> 33:31.262
If you'll notice, Y and M were able
to cut costs in a number of key ways.

33:31.297 --> 33:33.264
What's your take on the kid?

33:33.298 --> 33:35.032
Who?

33:35.066 --> 33:37.401
Mr. Ian Todd.

33:37.435 --> 33:38.903
Oh.

33:38.937 --> 33:42.272
Um, he's eager, driven.

33:42.307 --> 33:43.840
Green, though.

33:43.875 --> 33:47.377
He has a lot to learn, certainly smart
enough to do it if he cares to.

33:47.412 --> 33:49.346
An interesting background.

33:49.380 --> 33:50.848
Work in the private sector.

33:50.882 --> 33:52.750
Could be useful on a project like this.

33:52.784 --> 33:54.285
He'll fit in.

34:00.158 --> 34:01.892
I wonder what it's like

34:01.926 --> 34:05.162
to take the shape of the space you're in.

34:06.531 --> 34:09.032
Not enough water in the world.

34:19.945 --> 34:22.513
This project's certainly more complicated

34:22.547 --> 34:24.281
than anything he's dealt with.

34:24.315 --> 34:26.183
Might not be the best proving ground.

34:26.217 --> 34:28.186
I've gotta get a new number from McGantry.

34:28.219 --> 34:30.221
Keep the kid in the loop.

34:30.255 --> 34:32.188
He's got potential.

34:37.795 --> 34:40.797
Doyle: Is there some reason
you neglected to mention him?

34:42.100 --> 34:45.436
( Sighs )

34:45.469 --> 34:48.339
Truth be told, I forgot about it.

34:48.373 --> 34:51.009
It seems your security team forgot as well.

34:51.043 --> 34:53.311
There's no report
of this altercation on file.

34:53.344 --> 34:56.014
Do you know who the
gentleman in the photo is?

34:57.884 --> 35:01.954
He is an acquaintance of my daughter's.

35:03.223 --> 35:05.124
I'm assuming there's estrangement there,

35:05.158 --> 35:08.528
particularly after her arrest.

35:08.562 --> 35:11.230
Do you have reason to believe
she or anyone in her life

35:11.265 --> 35:13.633
would be interested in doing you harm?

35:13.667 --> 35:15.735
He was concerned
about her well-being.

35:15.769 --> 35:17.403
I bring this up to you only because

35:17.438 --> 35:19.472
if there is some underworld
element in play here,

35:19.507 --> 35:20.974
we should be made aware.

35:21.008 --> 35:24.844
I can't imagine he had
anything to do with it.

35:24.878 --> 35:27.280
Well, we'd still like to
identify and interview him.

35:27.314 --> 35:30.350
As I said earlier, it's essential that
we shine a light into every corner.

35:30.384 --> 35:33.686
The shots came from 700 yards away,

35:33.720 --> 35:35.721
and you bring me
a two-bit drug dealer.

35:35.756 --> 35:37.190
Fucking embarrassing.

35:37.224 --> 35:39.292
You can see yourself out.

35:45.466 --> 35:47.567
( Sighs )

35:57.211 --> 35:59.179
Come in.

35:59.213 --> 36:02.482
- <i>The prodigal one.</i>
- Not exactly.

36:02.517 --> 36:04.618
Don't hover.

36:06.554 --> 36:08.288
Horror show in here.

36:08.322 --> 36:09.756
I'm clearly lost without you.

36:09.791 --> 36:11.325
I doubt that.

36:11.359 --> 36:13.226
Hmm.

36:13.261 --> 36:14.761
See this shit?

36:18.399 --> 36:21.435
Isn't this from that meeting last
year about the blizzard response?

36:21.469 --> 36:24.671
I yelled at some son of a bitch over at
the "Sentinel," but it doesn't matter.

36:24.705 --> 36:26.406
They've printed a retraction
no one's gonna read.

36:26.441 --> 36:28.442
- ( Sighs )
- Damage done.

36:30.378 --> 36:32.279
So, you're here to make it official?

36:32.313 --> 36:34.314
You had to know it would come to this.

36:34.849 --> 36:38.418
Should never have let you
go, tenacious as you are.

36:38.452 --> 36:40.754
Can't begin to tell you how grateful I am.

36:40.788 --> 36:42.956
Not sure how I can ever repay you.

36:42.990 --> 36:46.659
Mm, Kane's right-hand man?

36:47.828 --> 36:49.295
I'm sure we can think of something.

36:49.329 --> 36:51.964
And betray the mayor's trust?
Sure, that's likely.

37:13.852 --> 37:15.586
Whoo.

37:30.168 --> 37:31.902
Tom:
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

37:36.475 --> 37:38.342
- ( Sighs )
- <i>( Glass bangs )</i>

37:38.376 --> 37:40.144
<i>Emma,</i>

37:40.178 --> 37:43.447
I know this situation is not your ideal.

37:44.850 --> 37:47.051
<i>I'd like to think</i>
<i>we could at least...</i>

37:47.085 --> 37:49.520
Emma, please.

37:49.554 --> 37:51.689
- I need to talk with you.
- Well, I don't wanna hear it.

37:51.723 --> 37:53.524
It's about your friend,

37:53.559 --> 37:55.927
the one from the clinic.

37:57.730 --> 38:00.198
He's a person of interest
in the investigation.

38:01.534 --> 38:03.268
What, Darius?

38:07.908 --> 38:09.542
Why would they even think that?

38:09.576 --> 38:12.511
Well, he came to see me, before.

38:13.580 --> 38:15.214
What did he say?

38:15.748 --> 38:17.950
He wanted me to get you out.

38:18.985 --> 38:20.486
Do you love him?

38:24.557 --> 38:27.526
Emma, please, I have to know.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.794
I have to know what you told him.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.262
I have to know what he knows about me.

38:32.332 --> 38:33.800
You.

38:33.834 --> 38:35.468
<i>Well, Darius doesn't know anything.</i>

38:35.503 --> 38:37.404
But me?
Ha, I knew better.

38:37.438 --> 38:40.941
<i>I am so stupid, so unbelievably stupid,</i>

38:40.975 --> 38:42.742
to trust you.

38:42.777 --> 38:47.614
This house is a prison, and don't
you dare try to pretend otherwise.

38:54.421 --> 38:56.889
My dear.

38:56.923 --> 38:58.891
Babe.

38:58.925 --> 39:00.559
Hello.

39:00.593 --> 39:03.528
- I wasn't expecting you, was I?
- <i>No.</i>

39:03.562 --> 39:05.630
I'm sorry.

39:05.664 --> 39:07.498
Will you indulge the intrusion?

39:16.609 --> 39:19.177
Glad to see you looking so well.

39:19.211 --> 39:21.079
A woman
of your fortitude...

39:21.113 --> 39:23.682
I had no doubt you'd
make a speedy recovery.

39:24.817 --> 39:26.351
Long road ahead yet.

39:26.385 --> 39:28.854
Well, I hope it's not too long

39:28.888 --> 39:31.056
before you can resume your duties.

39:31.090 --> 39:33.592
I don't have the rapport with your husband

39:33.626 --> 39:36.061
that I do with you.

39:39.232 --> 39:41.233
A man's ego can be cumbersome,

39:41.267 --> 39:45.237
but I have faith the two of you
will warm to each other in time.

39:45.271 --> 39:47.706
Well, I'm not sure we have time.

39:47.740 --> 39:51.343
Did you know he's opening up the Gardens

39:51.377 --> 39:54.212
to a competitive bidding process?

39:58.918 --> 40:00.986
I'm choosing not to concern myself

40:01.021 --> 40:02.955
with these matters at present.

40:02.989 --> 40:04.891
I'm sure you can understand why.

40:04.925 --> 40:07.293
Yes, of course.

40:07.327 --> 40:10.630
It's for appearances only, I assume.

40:10.664 --> 40:13.132
- ( Sighs )
- That's what it seems, anyway.

40:13.167 --> 40:16.569
But some reassurances would be appreciated.

40:18.338 --> 40:21.874
You're going to have to talk
to my husband about that.

40:25.646 --> 40:27.613
Of course.

40:38.659 --> 40:40.326
Is this a fucking joke?

40:40.360 --> 40:42.762
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
this is exactly the same shit

40:42.796 --> 40:44.497
McGantry sent over weeks ago, is it not?

40:44.531 --> 40:46.432
Mostly, yes.

40:46.467 --> 40:48.468
He removed a line item for courier fees.

40:48.503 --> 40:50.871
- Saved a couple thousand.
- Courier fees.

40:50.905 --> 40:54.174
Insatiable son of a bitch
thinks he can just...

40:59.947 --> 41:03.083
I always loved how clean it seemed

41:03.117 --> 41:05.052
when the snow would fall.

41:08.089 --> 41:09.657
But it's spring now.

41:09.691 --> 41:12.460
So wash it all away.

41:15.331 --> 41:18.801
Yes, that's right.

41:24.207 --> 41:26.409
Sir?

41:28.178 --> 41:30.179
Soon it'll be summer,

41:30.213 --> 41:31.680
then fall,

41:31.715 --> 41:34.316
then it's 10 years later.

41:34.350 --> 41:36.151
These people have waited long enough.

41:36.186 --> 41:38.754
Your guy...
this Young and Mortensen.

41:38.788 --> 41:41.356
- Mona: Yes, sir.
- Think they can actually hit that number?

41:41.391 --> 41:43.692
Assuming you can deal with the subs.

41:43.727 --> 41:45.427
Pull the trigger.

41:45.462 --> 41:48.030
Ian's not wrong.

41:48.065 --> 41:52.001
A reversal like this...
there will be blowback.

41:52.035 --> 41:54.871
We should set some meetings for the
aldermen whose contracts are affected.

41:54.905 --> 41:57.073
Ortiz'll squawk the loudest.
Start with him.

41:57.107 --> 41:59.041
Ian: <i>What about Moretti?
You want me to brief him?</i>

41:59.075 --> 42:00.943
- I'd rather handle that.
- <i>I'll make the announcement.</i>

42:00.977 --> 42:03.813
Mona, can you give us a minute?

42:03.847 --> 42:06.749
Yes, sir.

42:06.783 --> 42:09.652
- <i>( Door opens )</i>
- And close the door, please.

42:12.722 --> 42:14.657
Sit.

42:16.693 --> 42:18.427
How are you and Mona getting along?

42:18.461 --> 42:21.063
Fine.

42:21.097 --> 42:22.965
You weren't on board,

42:22.999 --> 42:24.900
moving away from McGantry.

42:24.934 --> 42:26.468
I'm wherever you are, sir.

42:26.503 --> 42:30.773
- I want you on Mona.
- Sir?

42:31.775 --> 42:33.376
Paying close attention.

42:34.712 --> 42:36.846
- Do you have concerns?
- <i>Quite the opposite.</i>

42:36.881 --> 42:39.949
- I think you can learn a lot from her.
- Of course.

42:39.984 --> 42:42.352
I'll study her closely

42:42.386 --> 42:44.721
as long as she's here.

42:44.756 --> 42:47.725
- Meaning?
- Oh, I just figured she was...

42:49.894 --> 42:53.097
A perfect way to position yourself
for a run is all I meant.

42:53.131 --> 42:55.333
Figured she'd want
to take on Ross next year.

42:55.367 --> 42:57.936
I hired you both for a reason.

42:57.970 --> 42:59.838
Never question my judgment.

43:03.109 --> 43:04.609
That's all.

43:17.521 --> 43:19.355
J-Just a minute.

43:27.030 --> 43:29.798
- I heard you were out.
- Sorry I didn't...

43:29.833 --> 43:32.401
- No.
- It's been hard.

43:32.436 --> 43:34.904
It's cool.
It's cool.

43:34.938 --> 43:37.239
I'm glad to see you, though.

43:37.273 --> 43:39.975
You, too.

43:40.010 --> 43:41.910
I've been worried.

43:41.945 --> 43:43.412
I could tell.

43:43.446 --> 43:45.114
Shavon... that was you?

43:46.116 --> 43:47.683
She took care of you?

43:47.718 --> 43:49.385
- Thanks.
- Okay.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.721
You shouldn't be here.

43:52.723 --> 43:55.024
( Scoffs )

43:55.058 --> 43:56.559
<i>I see how it is.</i>

43:56.593 --> 43:58.561
You do? How is it?

43:58.595 --> 44:00.863
Back in Daddy's house,
trying to be a good girl.

44:00.898 --> 44:02.565
Don't be like that.

44:04.969 --> 44:08.472
I got nothing left because of you.

44:08.506 --> 44:10.607
Do you get that?

44:10.642 --> 44:12.777
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

44:12.811 --> 44:16.647
Listen, you have to get out of Chicago.

44:16.681 --> 44:18.816
My father, he doesn't allow loose ends.

44:18.850 --> 44:20.718
Now I'm a loose end?

44:22.287 --> 44:24.955
- Look, I know this is all my fault.
- Wow.

44:24.990 --> 44:26.691
I should...

44:28.960 --> 44:31.562
Listen, you just...
you have to go, please.

44:31.596 --> 44:33.998
Come with me.

44:36.068 --> 44:37.935
I can't.

44:37.970 --> 44:40.138
Why not?

44:48.748 --> 44:52.784
Please, just...
just go.

45:07.167 --> 45:09.702
<i>( Over TV ) I'm Ben Zajac,</i>
<i>and I approve this message.</i>

45:09.736 --> 45:12.805
Announcer: <i>Paid for by</i>
<i>"Zajac for Illinois."</i>

45:14.708 --> 45:17.343
- Sir? Lunch.
- Oh, great.

45:17.377 --> 45:20.412
You know what? You can just put
it right there on the table.

45:23.516 --> 45:25.116
Woman:
<i>Oh, I love this one.</i>

45:25.150 --> 45:27.051
You look so distinguished.

45:27.086 --> 45:28.653
Everybody thinks so.

45:29.655 --> 45:31.188
Yeah? Everybody?

45:32.003 --> 45:34.124
I posted it on Facebook.

45:34.159 --> 45:35.692
( Both laugh )

45:35.727 --> 45:38.128
- Well, thank you for that.
- Of course.

45:39.497 --> 45:41.999
Well, enjoy your falafel.

45:43.167 --> 45:46.003
- Hey, Patty.
- Yes, sir?

45:46.037 --> 45:48.005
What do you want?

45:48.039 --> 45:51.641
- Me?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, you.

45:51.676 --> 45:53.677
Come on in.
Close the door.

45:59.317 --> 46:01.184
Have a seat.

46:03.788 --> 46:05.989
You've been working so hard lately.

46:06.023 --> 46:08.725
What is it you're hoping for

46:08.759 --> 46:10.226
if I win?

46:10.261 --> 46:11.595
<i>When</i> you win.

46:11.629 --> 46:14.031
( Chuckles ) Yeah, that, too.

46:15.033 --> 46:16.733
I don't know.

46:16.767 --> 46:19.202
Handle correspondence maybe?

46:19.236 --> 46:21.304
I mean, I wanna go
to grad school eventually,

46:21.338 --> 46:23.940
but I'm still
trying to figure...

46:26.744 --> 46:29.546
( Giggles )

46:29.580 --> 46:32.949
I can't tell you how long
I've been thinking about this.

46:32.984 --> 46:34.484
Oh, yeah?

46:37.522 --> 46:39.289
Yeah.

47:03.982 --> 47:05.850
<i>( Zipper zings )</i>

47:17.397 --> 47:19.832
Ooh, there you go.

47:32.179 --> 47:33.646
Kitty:
<i>God, you're relentless.</i>

47:33.680 --> 47:36.348
Some say that's my most endearing quality.

47:36.383 --> 47:38.918
Some who?

47:38.952 --> 47:41.153
Well, you, I was hoping.

47:42.188 --> 47:43.922
This all seems on the level.

47:43.957 --> 47:47.259
Except there isn't a shred of police
work done after the initial report.

47:47.293 --> 47:50.328
But don't you think Kane would
be pushing the PD on this?

47:50.363 --> 47:51.829
I really don't know.

47:51.864 --> 47:53.931
You should probably ask
someone who works for him.

47:53.965 --> 47:55.799
I'm asking you.

47:57.268 --> 47:59.869
I don't know...
it feels wrong.

47:59.904 --> 48:02.272
It doesn't feel wrong to you?

48:02.306 --> 48:04.441
I don't know what you want me to say.

48:05.543 --> 48:07.744
These things happen.

48:07.778 --> 48:11.949
- <i>( Heart monitor beeping )</i>
- <i>These seemingly random things.</i>

48:11.983 --> 48:15.986
Now I'm going to insert the cannula.

48:16.021 --> 48:19.057
Kitty: <i>I understand wanting</i>
<i>to find meaning in it all,</i>

48:19.091 --> 48:22.594
<i>but sometimes it's just</i>

48:22.628 --> 48:25.263
<i>what it seems to be...</i>

48:25.297 --> 48:28.566
<i>a mistake, an unfortunate event.</i>

48:28.601 --> 48:31.402
Doctor: You may feel
some slight cramping

48:31.436 --> 48:32.870
when the suction starts.

48:32.904 --> 48:35.206
Kitty:
<i>Sometimes you just...</i>

48:35.240 --> 48:38.108
<i>you just have to let it go,</i>

48:38.142 --> 48:39.643
<i>move on.</i>

48:42.480 --> 48:44.247
Nothing there, Sam.

48:50.755 --> 48:52.723
Well, you look really nice.

48:54.592 --> 48:56.159
Thanks.

48:56.193 --> 48:58.228
New job, actually.
First day.

48:58.262 --> 49:00.130
I gotta go.

49:00.164 --> 49:02.599
New job?
Who for?

49:02.633 --> 49:04.668
Walsh.

49:04.702 --> 49:07.104
Wait. What?
Are you... wait a second.

49:07.138 --> 49:08.872
That's...

49:08.906 --> 49:11.575
how the hell did that happen?

49:11.609 --> 49:14.378
I gotta go.

49:14.412 --> 49:17.481
Okay, but this isn't...
I'm not done with you.

49:17.515 --> 49:19.917
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

49:19.951 --> 49:22.053
( Scoffs )

49:22.087 --> 49:23.588
I'm gonna call you.

49:25.291 --> 49:27.859
As long as it's not about Stone.

49:29.896 --> 49:32.498
Tom: <i>I'd like to thank you all for
coming on such short notice.</i>

49:32.532 --> 49:34.333
- <i>( Cameras clicking )</i>
- I have a brief statement.

49:34.367 --> 49:37.370
Today, it is my great pleasure

49:37.404 --> 49:39.605
<i>to announce that we've taken</i>
<i>a substantial step forward</i>

49:39.640 --> 49:44.677
on the road to a revitalized
and reimagined Lennox Gardens.

49:44.711 --> 49:47.013
From the start, I have been
determined to approach

49:47.047 --> 49:49.248
this project from a new perspective.

49:50.451 --> 49:52.518
Come clean, Tom.

49:52.553 --> 49:54.086
Wash it all away.

49:57.658 --> 50:00.626
To that end, we have employed

50:00.661 --> 50:02.661
the development firm
of Young and Mortensen.

50:02.696 --> 50:05.264
Creative and driven,
they have offered a vision

50:05.298 --> 50:09.134
more compelling than my wildest
dreams could have conjured.

50:09.168 --> 50:10.668
They are efficient and committed,

50:10.703 --> 50:13.805
<i>and I look forward to a long</i>
<i>and fruitful relationship.</i>

50:18.044 --> 50:19.744
We're gonna slow this train down

50:19.778 --> 50:21.779
to a motherfuckin' crawl.

50:21.814 --> 50:23.814
Tom: <i>It is no secret</i>
<i>the fabric of this city</i>

50:23.849 --> 50:28.452
<i>is woven with threads</i>
<i>of venality and honor alike,</i>

50:28.486 --> 50:31.655
but I will offer this message
to those who would seek

50:31.690 --> 50:34.458
exorbitant profit
from this project...

50:34.492 --> 50:36.193
an honest day's work

50:36.227 --> 50:39.196
will garner an honest day's wage,

50:39.231 --> 50:42.466
<i>but avarice will not be tolerated.</i>

50:43.802 --> 50:46.704
Greed stops here.

50:46.738 --> 50:49.173
It is a new day for Lennox Gardens.

50:50.975 --> 50:54.144
Spring has come to Chicago.

50:54.178 --> 50:57.180
- Thank you.
- <i>( Reporters clamoring )</i>

51:12.397 --> 51:14.431
( Sniffs )

51:16.968 --> 51:19.970
- I don't know what to think.
- Can't Jason have my peas?

51:20.004 --> 51:23.006
- I don't want them.
- Jason has his own peas.

51:23.041 --> 51:24.909
But this is a good thing, right?

51:24.943 --> 51:26.744
What you wanted?

51:29.381 --> 51:30.982
<i>( Keyboard clicks )</i>

51:32.785 --> 51:34.352
Did you see his press conference?

51:34.386 --> 51:36.554
- Bor-ing.
- Don't be rude.

51:36.588 --> 51:38.056
Jason, eat your peas.

51:38.090 --> 51:40.692
You think he's good for it?

51:40.726 --> 51:42.594
I want to, obviously, but...

51:44.430 --> 51:47.933
there are these moments
where he seems elsewhere.

51:47.967 --> 51:49.635
<i>( Phone ringing )</i>

51:49.669 --> 51:51.670
At first I thought
it was some sort of test,

51:51.705 --> 51:54.774
like he was playing me
or something, but...

51:54.808 --> 51:58.144
<i>but now I think he might be
legitimately shaken by all this.</i>

51:58.179 --> 52:01.247
- <i>( Ringing continues )</i>
- Sean: <i>Before I forget, the gas company came out.</i>

52:01.282 --> 52:04.350
<i>Something with the main line. We had to</i>
<i>clear the house for a couple hours.</i>

52:04.385 --> 52:05.785
Mona:
<i>But they fixed it, right?</i>

52:05.819 --> 52:08.120
Alissa: <i>Can we talk about</i>
<i>kid stuff now?</i>

52:08.155 --> 52:10.022
Mona: <i>All right, bitsy,</i>
<i>your turn.</i>

52:10.056 --> 52:12.490
- Today I blocked three kicks.
- Mm!

52:12.525 --> 52:16.094
- Sam only blocked one. She got scored on, too.
- <i>( Ringing continues )</i>

52:26.705 --> 52:28.372
Hello?

52:32.478 --> 52:33.978
Who?

52:37.517 --> 52:39.318
Thanks.

52:46.559 --> 52:49.127
They got him, Stoney...

52:49.161 --> 52:50.995
the man who shot her.

52:52.063 --> 52:53.898
They got him.
