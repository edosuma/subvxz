00:26.192 --> 00:27.693
Good evening.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.328
I'm Helen Mirren,

00:29.330 --> 00:31.697
and you're watching
"Documentary Now!",

00:31.699 --> 00:33.632
season 51.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.567
George Bernard Shaw
famously said,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.736
"There is no sincerer love

00:37.738 --> 00:40.339
than the love of food."

00:40.341 --> 00:43.275
At a small restaurant
in the hills of Colombia,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.611
that love is in full bloom

00:45.613 --> 00:47.413
as captured in the film,

00:47.415 --> 00:50.215
"Juan Likes Rice & Chicken."

02:37.290 --> 02:38.724
Look, you know, I've...
I've been to Noma,

02:38.726 --> 02:40.425
and I've been to elBulli,

02:40.427 --> 02:42.327
and I've been to all
of Robuchon's places,

02:42.329 --> 02:45.731
but there's no restaurant like
this anywhere in the world.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.634
I write guidebooks about
South American restaurants.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.602
And... every year
I travel the continent

02:50.604 --> 02:52.437
looking for something new,

02:52.439 --> 02:55.174
yet I always find myself back

02:55.176 --> 02:57.809
at Juan's Rice & Chicken.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.212
It's shocking how
simple it all is.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.648
There is a consistent,
simple, set menu.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.517
To start, a cup of warm coffee,

03:05.519 --> 03:09.254
followed by a banana
split perfectly in half.

03:09.256 --> 03:12.191
Then rice with a little
bit of butter,

03:12.193 --> 03:15.761
and on most days, chicken.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.763
Most impressively,

03:17.765 --> 03:20.599
it's the only three-star
Michelin restaurant I know of

03:20.601 --> 03:23.669
that's a 40-minute walk
from the nearest road.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.948
We've been so excited

03:35.950 --> 03:38.450
ever since we read about Juan
on Chompzilla.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.419
See, we love the way
good food tastes.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.388
But what we really love
is authenticity of style

03:43.390 --> 03:44.823
and honesty of preparation,

03:44.825 --> 03:47.826
so this is a really
big deal for us.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.695
We should have brought water.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.563
Well, that wasn't
on the reviews.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.865
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm gonna comment on that.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.944
Juan has the eyes of a man

05:12.946 --> 05:15.847
who knows exactly
what he is doing.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.649
And Arturo has the eyes
of a man

05:17.651 --> 05:19.051
who is thinking,

05:19.053 --> 05:21.753
"Am I doing this right?"

05:21.755 --> 05:23.355
Something I always hear is,

05:23.357 --> 05:25.424
"What's going to happen
when Juan retires?"

05:25.426 --> 05:28.727
Now, historically speaking,
when a great chef retires,

05:28.729 --> 05:30.329
the restaurant closes.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.830
You know, I...
I don't know if Arturo

05:31.832 --> 05:33.665
could...
could take over for Juan.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.771
Juan's Rice & Chicken, you...

05:39.773 --> 05:41.506
you couldn't believe that
something so simple

05:41.508 --> 05:43.742
could taste so deceivingly
complex and delicious.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.811
I mean, how the hell do you
take four ingredients

05:45.813 --> 05:48.080
and translate that into
three Michelin stars?

05:48.082 --> 05:51.650
I mean, it's superior technique.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.051
Gracias.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.820
Senor, gracias.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.756
The chicken?

05:57.758 --> 06:00.359
- No... Nope?
- No?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.961
- No.
- Pollo. It's pollo.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.063
Oh, okay.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.765
Okay.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.668
- Gracias.
- Thank you.

07:40.726 --> 07:43.662
We're talking about a man
who is 80 years old

07:43.664 --> 07:45.797
and yet every day
goes to the farm

07:45.799 --> 07:47.866
and picks out
the chicken he wants.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.768
And then he has the farmer
take the chicken

07:49.770 --> 07:51.236
and set it in a pen,

07:51.238 --> 07:53.238
at which point,
Juan gives himself

07:53.240 --> 07:56.208
exactly five minutes
to catch the chicken.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.857
If he catches the chicken,

08:11.859 --> 08:13.525
there is chicken on the menu.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.026
But if he doesn't
catch the chicken,

08:15.028 --> 08:16.828
he believes that
fate has spoken

08:16.830 --> 08:18.864
and wants the chicken to live.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.968
This is the biggest fear
about Arturo...

08:22.970 --> 08:25.070
that he will change
this process,

08:25.072 --> 08:27.706
because Arturo...

08:27.708 --> 08:29.908
is afraid of chickens.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.781
All chefs work hard, okay?

12:29.783 --> 12:33.384
But Juan has sacrificed
his entire life for his craft.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.019
I mean, do you know this?

12:35.021 --> 12:37.122
He hasn't missed a day of work
in 35 years.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.957
He's had three heart attacks,
and each time,

12:38.959 --> 12:41.192
he toughed it out and didn't
go to the hospital

12:41.194 --> 12:43.027
until the last customer left.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.262
And the next morning,

12:44.264 --> 12:46.531
he checked himself out
of the hospital.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.434
Five years ago, Juan's wife
left him for their neighbor.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.402
Two years later, he ran
into her in the street

12:51.404 --> 12:52.904
and he said,
"Where have you been?"

12:52.906 --> 12:55.006
He hadn't even noticed.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.909
So for Juan, it is impossible
to accept anything less

12:57.911 --> 12:59.477
than a life's commitment.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.329
Okay.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.805
You know, they call
a man who is afraid

17:53.807 --> 17:55.273
a chicken.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.407
So what do you call a man

17:56.409 --> 17:57.809
who is afraid of a chicken?

17:57.811 --> 18:00.578
I mean, can you even call him
a man at all?

21:30.500 --> 21:33.500
