( clearing throat )

00:57.658 --> 00:59.324
Okay, quiet, everyone.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.693
Quiet!!
Oh.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.229
I assume you all brought
your swords.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.697
Uh... what?

01:05.699 --> 01:06.899
It said on the invitation

01:06.901 --> 01:08.600
you're supposed
to bring a sword.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.937
I was a little confused
by your invitation.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.338
I'm not confused.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.841
This is clearly a drawing
of meat.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.943
I came for the meat.

01:17.945 --> 01:21.013
I think everyone's
just wondering why they're here.

01:21.015 --> 01:24.283
Uh, it's the 37th
of Grovnok.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.718
- Mewnipendence Day.
- ( Ferguson coughs )

01:26.720 --> 01:28.620
( frustrated groan )

01:39.732 --> 01:42.668
Mewnipendence Day.

01:42.670 --> 01:46.772
Along time ago arrived the first
settlers of Mewni.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.941
( boat noises )

01:48.943 --> 01:52.244
A modest people
with noble pursuits--

01:52.246 --> 01:55.380
life, liberty,
and corn.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.916
But the wicked monsters
rose up and attacked

01:57.918 --> 01:59.651
the innocent Mewnans

01:59.653 --> 02:01.620
to re-steal Mewni
for themselves.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.123
So the queen
used her magic

02:04.125 --> 02:08.093
to turn the simple peasants
into a fearsome army.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.728
And then there was fighting.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.230
Fighting, fighting,
fighting, fighting.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.764
And the Mewnans won.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.099
Ta-da!

02:14.101 --> 02:16.401
( imitating fireworks
exploding )

02:16.403 --> 02:19.771
Wait. But you just blew
past all the important parts.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.808
- When do we eat?
- We feast after we re-enact

02:22.810 --> 02:25.644
the great monster
massacre!

02:25.646 --> 02:26.979
Now please split into
two teams--

02:26.981 --> 02:28.714
monsters and Mewnans.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.782
- Can I be a human?
- You are a monster.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.417
That's why you
were invited.

02:32.419 --> 02:33.919
Why do I always
get picked to...

02:33.921 --> 02:35.921
- I wanna be a Mewman.
- I wanna be a Mewman.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.256
( all chattering )

02:37.258 --> 02:39.057
You get to be
my general.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.325
Thanks.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.127
Lookin' pretty good.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.429
Now we can begin
making costumes,

02:44.431 --> 02:48.233
and after that,
the blood battle
can commence.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.002
Yes, Marco.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.837
What's that?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.672
Oh, that's just
an all-seeing eye.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.773
It follows you
around all day.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.675
It's staring at me.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.411
Don't worry, it's just
to remind the monsters

02:59.413 --> 03:03.015
that the royal family
is always watching.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.017
It's not actually
watching you, though.

03:05.019 --> 03:08.020
( laughs )
That would be weird.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.688
This is amazing!

03:09.690 --> 03:11.690
She thinks
it's the all-seeing eye,

03:11.692 --> 03:13.325
but it's not.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.460
It is the most
efficient way to spy
on your enemies.

03:15.462 --> 03:18.697
( giggling )
I can see her pores.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.166
What secrets
lie beneath?

03:21.168 --> 03:23.135
Ludo, Master.

03:23.137 --> 03:25.304
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
( makes kissing noises )

03:25.306 --> 03:26.872
Look at this.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.142
Now we can watch Star
wherever she goes.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.844
In the kitchen,
bedroom, even in the bathroom.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.713
Uh... sir?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.081
Maybe we don't
keep the bathroom channel.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.750
But Ludo, this eye
only has one eye.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.185
My face has two.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.754
That's twice the number
of the eyes.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.823
Now that you don't have
any spy stuff to do,

03:44.825 --> 03:46.825
you should get us
some popcorn and milkshakes.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.128
I'm pretty sure we're gonna
binge-watch this baby
all night.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.863
You can join us if you want,

03:51.865 --> 03:54.266
as long as you keep quiet
and sit in the back.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.338
She doesn't even know
we're watching her.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.841
Sometimes your biggest threat
is right under your nose.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.743
My nose is in my beak.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.345
Mm-hmm.

04:09.449 --> 04:13.218
( straining )
There.

04:13.220 --> 04:17.889
That'll keep your entrails
from becoming your out-trails.

04:19.859 --> 04:21.927
My pillow.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.397
Hey, Star, I've been
looking through your...

04:25.399 --> 04:27.099
Hold on.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.800
I've been looking
through your book,

04:28.802 --> 04:31.069
and, uh, something
seems off.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.138
What do you mean?
Let me see.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.116
Oh, okay.

04:45.251 --> 04:48.086
Wow, you're right, Marco.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.122
I can't believe
I didn't notice that before.

04:50.124 --> 04:53.525
Sharper, sharper,
stabbier,

04:53.527 --> 04:56.328
and you need to be on
a Warnicorn.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.099
And now, for the monsters.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.837
Hey, what do we get?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.839
Hello. You're monsters.
Use your claws.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.574
( growling )

05:18.051 --> 05:21.353
Star, I know the monsters
are bad and all,

05:21.355 --> 05:24.423
but this seems unfair.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.158
Unfair?

05:27.994 --> 05:32.597
Do something.
He's writhing in pain.

05:32.599 --> 05:35.534
Oh, never mind.
He stopped.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.102
Mom.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.470
Owie.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.473
Comrades, it's beginning.

05:41.475 --> 05:45.977
Toffee replaced me
with electronic eye.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.113
- Uh, we don't care.
- But you should.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.449
Pretty soon,
Toffee will replace you

05:50.451 --> 05:52.384
with electronic
ice cream cone,

05:52.386 --> 05:55.354
and you with another
electronic ice cream cone.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.988
And you with...

05:56.990 --> 05:58.990
What is it you do
exactly?

05:58.992 --> 06:04.896
Um, there's two of us,
so... maybe that's a thing.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.898
Are you finished?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.534
Gentlemen, allow me to direct
your attention

06:09.536 --> 06:11.069
to our new
surveillance device.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.038
Princess Butterfly
is re-enacting

06:13.040 --> 06:14.873
our favorite holiday,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.341
the great monster massacre.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.577
My least favorite
holiday.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.413
Don't worry, we can take
advantage of this opportunity.

06:25.051 --> 06:29.087
Why send an army
after the wand

06:29.089 --> 06:32.324
when it can be
hand delivered?

06:32.326 --> 06:35.026
( gasps )
Oh, isn't that a thing thing?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.496
And it's not like
she's going to notice

06:37.498 --> 06:39.164
a real monster.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.266
Those aren't real?

06:41.268 --> 06:43.235
Okay.

06:43.237 --> 06:46.538
Now, who'd like to bring
Ludo his wand?

06:46.540 --> 06:49.674
( all mumbling )

06:49.676 --> 06:51.243
I will go.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.979
I thought you might,
you fat bag of garbage.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.195
- I'm so sorry,
Ferguson.
- Come on!

07:15.101 --> 07:17.235
Hey, Star,
everything's
set up.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.604
We'll get started
whenever you give
the signal.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.673
Or not, and we can
just go eat.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.508
No, it's okay.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.310
It'll be fun.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.078
Okay.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.416
Here we go.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.251
Knights of Mewni,

07:33.253 --> 07:35.120
Take up your
stabby weapons,

07:35.122 --> 07:39.090
and drive out
the evil monsters!

07:42.328 --> 07:44.463
ALL: Wow!

07:44.465 --> 07:46.231
( battle cries )

07:52.038 --> 07:53.271
I can't do this.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.173
Make me invisible.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.384
- I'm so sorry,
Ferguson.
- Come on!

08:16.162 --> 08:19.064
Careful.
What a massacre.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.078
Please don't hurt me.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.114
( laughs )

08:49.795 --> 08:52.163
( stammering )

08:52.165 --> 08:53.265
( gasping )

09:00.206 --> 09:01.406
What is he doing?

09:02.675 --> 09:04.209
Ferguson?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.049
Ferguson!

09:15.254 --> 09:17.122
I am so sorry.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.257
Marco was right,
this is unfair.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.359
Ferguson, are you okay?

09:21.361 --> 09:24.763
I'm fine.
I'm just invisible.

09:37.476 --> 09:41.246
All right, let's go
eat some corn.

09:41.248 --> 09:45.150
ALFONZO: Yeah,
I need to sit down
for a few days.

09:45.152 --> 09:48.253
What a disgrace.
This is what you get

09:48.255 --> 09:50.221
when you hire people
from the swamp.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.123
Let's watch again.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.131
I'm telling you,
this thing,

10:00.133 --> 10:02.233
it didn't work.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.605
- It works fine for me.
- He sabotaged it.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.406
I rescued you from
a life in the swamp.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.475
I took you in,
I gave you pants,

10:10.477 --> 10:13.411
and this is what
you do to repay...
wait a minute.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.246
Where are your pants?

10:15.248 --> 10:16.414
Uh, well...

10:16.416 --> 10:17.816
Oh, get real!

10:17.818 --> 10:20.185
You've brought shame
on this house.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.454
Now go to your room.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.156
I don't know what to do
about that one.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.592
Should I take away
his milkshake privileges?

10:27.594 --> 10:30.295
Seriously? This was
idiot-proof.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.297
I think you know
what you have to do.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.865
Uh...

10:35.468 --> 10:40.171
No, wait. No!

10:40.173 --> 10:43.241
Well, that was
pretty hardcore.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.410
You did what
had to be done.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.213
( chattering )

10:49.415 --> 10:51.149
Um, are you sure
this is accurate?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.817
You know what?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.719
I think it's time
we just put the book away.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.354
Okay.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.174
No.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.510
Nope.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.879
Reading in the tub
is not...

11:24.316 --> 11:26.885
a sure-fire fun way
to spice up a dull day.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.720
Hmm.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.256
Today might be the day
I face my biggest fear.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.324
Boredom.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.795
Maybe today's the day
I renounce my vow

11:36.797 --> 11:39.264
to never have a dull day.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.802
Today I will look
boredom in its eyes,

11:43.804 --> 11:46.204
those beady little
black eyes,

11:46.206 --> 11:47.972
like tiny little
black fists.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.342
I'll look into those eyes
and I will say...

11:51.344 --> 11:53.478
Oh, wait, never mind.
What's this? Oh!

11:53.480 --> 11:55.380
The banagic wand.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.349
Earth's coolest
magical treat.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.518
( gasps )
Earth magic!

12:00.520 --> 12:02.520
I swear to baby dolphin
giggles,

12:02.522 --> 12:04.656
I will find
the banagic wand

12:04.658 --> 12:06.558
before this day is done...

12:06.560 --> 12:08.359
or die trying.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.429
Or my name's not
Star Butterfly.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.431
As me as my witness,

12:13.433 --> 12:16.267
I'll never go bored again!

12:16.269 --> 12:18.703
And anything else
I'm supposed to say

12:18.705 --> 12:20.271
to make this official.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.273
Whoo-hoo!

12:22.275 --> 12:23.775
I don't know
where I'm going.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.276
Hmmm.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.612
Ah, "as featured on TV."

12:27.614 --> 12:30.248
But I saw it in
this magazine.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.517
Mmm. Aha!

12:32.519 --> 12:34.586
A riddle.
( laughs )

12:34.588 --> 12:37.722
But I'm terrible at riddles.
Need Marco.

12:37.724 --> 12:41.292
( inhaling deeply )

12:43.729 --> 12:46.297
- Marco!
- Ah!

12:46.299 --> 12:49.334
- Earth magic. Look.
- That thing from TV?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.835
( gasps )
You've seen it?

12:50.837 --> 12:53.371
Yeah. It's one of those
late night commercials.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.574
So it does exist.
To the TV!

12:56.576 --> 12:59.511
I can't. I've gotta get
to my karate class.

13:01.313 --> 13:04.516
Your new kidney
came from a werewolf.

13:04.518 --> 13:05.984
Glitter Grenade Rewind.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.420
<i>It's so hot.</i>

13:09.422 --> 13:10.789
<i>And I'm so bored.</i>

13:10.791 --> 13:15.293
What are they gonna do?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.728
<i>It's a little bit</i>
<i>of banana,</i>

13:16.730 --> 13:18.463
<i>and a little lot of magic.</i>

13:18.465 --> 13:20.732

13:31.845 --> 13:35.480
<i>There's enough banagic fun</i>

13:35.482 --> 13:37.081
<i>( all exclaiming</i>
<i>happily )</i>

13:37.083 --> 13:40.351
Friendship magic.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.453
<i>Available at better stores</i>
<i>near you.</i>

13:42.455 --> 13:44.022
Better stores?

13:46.425 --> 13:48.426
Supplies are limited.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.829
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

13:53.566 --> 13:54.632
I can't.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.568
I have karate.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.436
Today we're learning
how to channel

13:58.438 --> 13:59.971
our emotions.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.507
To a better store
near us.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.343
- Did you hear
anything I just said?
- ( humming )

14:05.345 --> 14:07.846
♪ A little bit of banana,
a little lot of magic ♪

14:07.848 --> 14:09.848
Star, I can't go now.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.649
And I'm not sure you have
a firm enough grasp

14:11.651 --> 14:13.718
on Earth culture
to go on your own.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.988
Hey, get out of yard box,
you scoundrel!

14:16.990 --> 14:19.357
Hide your dragon eggs
somewhere else.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.359
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.695
- ( groans )
- Marco, we're not moving.

14:23.697 --> 14:27.532
You push these little thingies
with your feet.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.467
Honestly, Marco,
sometimes I wonder

14:29.469 --> 14:31.870
if you have a firm grasp
on this Earth stuff.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.572
Oh, too slow.
Bunny Rocket Blast!

14:39.678 --> 14:41.412
Karate class?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.414
Marco, we don't
have time for detours.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.850
The commercial said
we have to hurry

14:45.852 --> 14:48.486
while supplies last.
Focus on the quest.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.555
This is where I'm going.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.956
Karate.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.124
I am not going with you.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.994
Dear, sweet Marco.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.030
I commend him for making it
this far on the journey,

14:59.032 --> 15:02.567
and vow to complete
the quest in his honor.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.535
Good-bye, sweet Marco.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.484
The store is guarded
by a werewolf.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.120
I wish you no harm,
werewolf.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.056
All I seek
is the banagic wand.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.558
Is this a better store?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.460
Uh, better than what?

15:29.462 --> 15:31.696
( frustrated groan )
More riddles.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.698
I wish Marco
was still with us.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.569
You must learn to channel
what is deep inside you.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.971
Diaz, name an emotion.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.973
- Uh, hunger.
- Channel your hunger, Diaz.

15:41.975 --> 15:46.511
Channel your emotions
to brave the gauntlet of fire!

15:48.814 --> 15:51.549
Wait, we're gonna walk
on those?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.751
( evil laughter )

15:53.753 --> 15:56.220
- ( door bell rings )
- Uh, that one's okay.

15:56.222 --> 15:59.557
but there's a better store
down on Main and Riverside.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.492
A better store near me.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.595
There's a better store
on Main and Riverside?

16:04.597 --> 16:07.765
- Yeah.
- Whoo-hoo!

16:07.767 --> 16:10.001
Which way is
Main and Riverside?

16:10.003 --> 16:11.569
Aha!

16:13.005 --> 16:15.173
Diaz, approach.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.257
Classic Marco.
Writhing in agony.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.625
( growls )

16:34.627 --> 16:37.595
Okay, I'm on Main Street.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.864
Now, where is
Riverside?

16:39.866 --> 16:43.634
( gasps )
A river and its side.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.169
I found it!

16:45.171 --> 16:47.271
Like I knew I would.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.777
Ahoy, matey.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.149
- Pirates.
- That's what we arrgh.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.619
Now come with me
to Davey Jones' fish locker.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.855
Okay, pirate.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.656
I am at your mercy,

17:05.658 --> 17:08.693
for I am but
your helpless prisoner.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.829
Not true. I'm a powerful
princess from another dimension,

17:11.831 --> 17:14.065
and I'm gonna get us
all out of here.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.067
Freedom is nigh!

17:17.536 --> 17:19.604
Arrgh, ma'am?

17:23.709 --> 17:25.676
Surrender, pirates.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.581
Huh?

17:30.583 --> 17:33.651
Stay back, you
bloodthirsty savages.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.554
- Tiara Tornado!
- Enough!

17:36.556 --> 17:40.591
Do you surrender, pirate?

17:40.593 --> 17:41.859
We aren't pirates.

17:41.861 --> 17:45.563
This is a pirate-themed
restaurant.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.566
( nervous giggle )

17:48.568 --> 17:50.835
Do you know where
I can find a better store?

17:50.837 --> 17:52.837
( screaming )

18:02.281 --> 18:05.016
A better store.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.617
MAN: There she is!

18:07.986 --> 18:10.621
Can I borrow this?
Thanks so much.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.589
Bye.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.624
My baby's in there.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.660
Oh, no, there he is.

18:17.996 --> 18:19.931
( all yelling )

18:19.933 --> 18:22.733
Oh, no!
Starlight Foot Smash!

18:24.770 --> 18:28.339
Miranda, I swear, if you
wear fuzzy boots to my party,

18:28.341 --> 18:30.808
I will break
your feet off.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.610
What the...

18:32.612 --> 18:34.312
Brittany, you've gotta help me.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.947
There's an angry mob
after me.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.248
Could you throw 'em
off my trail?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.317
Tell them I went
that way? Thanks. Bye!

18:41.086 --> 18:42.687
She went in there.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.657
And here we have
Marco Diaz

18:46.659 --> 18:48.292
approaching
the gauntlet of fire.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.795
It's been a tough 14 years
for Diaz.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.799
No girlfriend, can't seem
to get past green belt.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.336
That history of failure must be
suffocating him right now.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.637
Jeremy, get out of here!

18:59.639 --> 19:01.806
I'm trying to channel
my emotions.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.141
( camera clicks )

19:06.211 --> 19:09.247
Fail, fail, fail.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.215
Enough!!

19:29.835 --> 19:31.702
You little twerp.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.838
Diaz, wait!

19:33.840 --> 19:35.673
- Huh?
- You did it!

19:39.378 --> 19:42.246
( laughs )
I did it.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.748
I understand now, sensei.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.183
Diaz.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.084
- This was all a part...
- Diaz.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.253
- You had Jeremy act...
- Diaz!

19:49.255 --> 19:51.756
Foot fire, buddy.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.395
( shivering )

19:57.397 --> 19:59.964
They're magnificent,
aren't they?

19:59.966 --> 20:03.801
You! Time to pay for
what you've done.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.737
Are they talking to you?

20:06.739 --> 20:09.707
Mm-hmm.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.245
Wreck my store?

20:14.247 --> 20:16.214
I'll show you.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.915
Okay, you guys
need to chill out.

I know. I was there.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.122
It was way easy.

I did.
