Vice Minister?

13:31.943 --> 13:34.130
- Finance Minister?
- Yes, Deputy.

13:34.193 --> 13:36.528
There was a $500,000
transfer from my department.

13:36.553 --> 13:39.903
- Could you look into the receiver? It's urgent.
- Right away.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.052
- Yes?
- Deputy.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.739
We had no dealings with that account,

13:49.755 --> 13:54.677
and 1 minute after the transfer,
the money was moved to China.

13:55.326 --> 13:58.005
This is definitely a burner account.

13:58.584 --> 13:59.310
What?

13:59.365 --> 14:02.982
Voice phishing scammers
use them to move money to China.

14:03.021 --> 14:04.021

14:04.537 --> 14:06.247
- Voice phishing?
- Yes.

14:06.341 --> 14:08.247
That can't be.

14:08.732 --> 14:12.208
They knew about Deputy Director's
retirement and our situation.

14:12.232 --> 14:13.857
It is them!

Hey!

How did you?

15:44.098 --> 15:45.760
What is wrong with you?

15:46.201 --> 15:47.465
Is this your revenge?

15:47.565 --> 15:49.972
Go away, I'm busy. Leave!

15:55.292 --> 15:56.692
I can't believe this.

16:03.741 --> 16:05.800

16:05.825 --> 16:08.005
Why are you still there?! Just leave!

16:36.974 --> 16:39.552

Figuring out if this is

19:15.206 --> 19:17.208
If you report us, we'll go to jail.

19:17.905 --> 19:22.109
But you'll be killed silently and swiftly.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.465
I'm kidding.

19:29.304 --> 19:30.304
I see.

19:32.898 --> 19:34.148
And kind of not.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.244
Half pepperoni, half Hawaiian, you know.

19:37.820 --> 19:38.820
Right.

19:46.347 --> 19:47.347
Passed!

19:48.215 --> 19:49.252
Thank you!

19:50.906 --> 19:55.140
<i>Figuring out if this is
the right company is crucial.</i>

19:59.068 --> 20:00.466
This way, please.

20:00.715 --> 20:03.229
Welcome, Welcome.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.141
Good to see you.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.272
<i>Server Management Office</i>

20:22.263 --> 20:24.166
Where do I start looking?

20:32.299 --> 20:33.299
Excuse me?

20:35.602 --> 20:37.269
What are you looking for?

20:37.732 --> 20:39.728
No, well...

20:40.104 --> 20:43.492
I'm new, I was looking for
the education room.

20:43.591 --> 20:46.723
All the offices look the same.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.513
Is that so?

21:01.106 --> 21:02.206
Oh.

21:03.087 --> 21:07.291
Are you worried that
something might happen?

21:08.073 --> 21:10.111
No need to worry at all.

21:10.176 --> 21:14.394
We use the most secured
communication system,

21:14.699 --> 21:17.668
so you will not be traced.

21:18.109 --> 21:21.603
You may not believe me,
but we recently scammed NSA,

21:21.667 --> 21:23.939
and no repercussion.

21:24.146 --> 21:25.353
Seriously?

21:28.620 --> 21:29.620
Of course.

21:29.990 --> 21:33.684
They transferred $500,000
as a sign of patriotism!

21:34.955 --> 21:37.909
I think that's enough for company intro.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.757
How about a welcome from our president?

21:40.857 --> 21:41.857
President CHOI?

21:52.917 --> 21:54.855
Afternoon, I'm CHOI Min-suk.

21:55.076 --> 21:57.185
After receiving training today,

21:57.242 --> 21:59.678
you'll go into battle tomorrow.

22:00.218 --> 22:02.583
No need to worry about your performance.

22:02.683 --> 22:07.796
We don't criticize or cut you
like the outside world.

22:08.356 --> 22:11.382
We won't penalize you based on score.

22:11.418 --> 22:14.919
We'll always support your dreams.

22:18.251 --> 22:20.090
Because we're a family now.

22:28.649 --> 22:31.162
So, end of orientation!

22:34.955 --> 22:36.304
Thank you all.

22:37.526 --> 22:38.860
Thank you very much.

22:39.685 --> 22:42.412
Since it's your first day,
let's introduce ourselves.

22:44.728 --> 22:46.091
Ms. YOO Je-yun?

22:47.789 --> 22:50.389
Good to see you, say hello everyone.

22:50.431 --> 22:51.638
Ms. JOO Ye-ji?

22:52.426 --> 22:54.159
Ms. JOO? You're so pretty!

22:54.912 --> 22:56.191
Ms. WOO Do-young?

22:56.283 --> 22:57.283
Yes?

23:00.502 --> 23:02.178
Ms. UHM Jung-me?

23:13.556 --> 23:14.956
- Deputy!
- Don't!

23:15.338 --> 23:16.858
Don't call me that here!

23:16.887 --> 23:18.485
Be covert!

23:19.366 --> 23:20.633
So what should I...

23:21.908 --> 23:23.375
Can I call you 'baby'?

23:24.423 --> 23:26.113
Give me the situation report.

23:26.617 --> 23:28.996
I found it! This is the place.

23:29.301 --> 23:30.253
Yeah?

23:30.296 --> 23:31.837
- But...
- But what?

23:32.207 --> 23:34.614
One of the employees is a cop.

23:35.431 --> 23:37.625
Cop? How do you know that?

23:37.892 --> 23:41.759
I saw her catching a pickpocket
a few days ago.

23:42.874 --> 23:45.019
Could she be undercover too?

23:45.417 --> 23:46.950
I don't believe this...

23:47.079 --> 23:48.146
What's her name?

23:48.705 --> 23:49.863
I'm not sure...

23:50.396 --> 23:51.979
Someone's coming.

23:52.142 --> 23:55.345
I'll look into it
and text you, baby.

23:57.676 --> 23:59.209
I'm getting goosebumps.

24:08.570 --> 24:10.750
- What the fuck are you?
- And right here is...

24:10.808 --> 24:13.222
I told you not to swear!

24:13.720 --> 24:14.853
Listen carefully.

24:14.941 --> 24:17.519
As per Criminal Law, Article 311,

24:17.789 --> 24:22.121
insulting a person is a year
in prison, or $2,000 in fine.

24:23.343 --> 24:25.686
Who's the asshole swearing beside you?

24:25.843 --> 24:26.979
A friend?

24:27.235 --> 24:28.835
Want to get a double fine?

24:29.293 --> 24:31.658
Where are you? Hello?!

24:31.729 --> 24:33.455
Who the fuck did that?!

24:35.855 --> 24:37.003
Sorry about that.

24:38.079 --> 24:39.399
I got worked up.

24:39.805 --> 24:40.805
Ms. NA.

24:41.246 --> 24:43.788
Swearing won't get them
to fork out money.

24:43.853 --> 24:46.395
What will the rookies learn
if you always rage out?

24:46.417 --> 24:47.417
NA JUNG-AN

24:47.560 --> 24:49.151
You're a senior now.

24:49.925 --> 24:51.192
Very pretty senior.

24:54.079 --> 24:56.899
Teach and guide our new recruits.

24:57.106 --> 24:58.412
Oh, sure.

25:00.543 --> 25:01.956
Your station.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.781
JANG YOUNG-SIL

25:05.997 --> 25:07.332
Starting tomorrow,

25:07.979 --> 25:11.558
you'll learn from real life cases.

25:11.764 --> 25:13.923
Stations have your names on it.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.480
So please check before you leave.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.150
What is it?

25:20.202 --> 25:21.936
Pleasure to work with you.

25:25.954 --> 25:27.190
Good bye.

25:44.330 --> 25:45.836
What are you doing?

25:47.462 --> 25:48.719
Were you followed?

25:50.221 --> 25:51.221
Followed?

25:51.418 --> 25:52.418
Forget it.

25:58.442 --> 25:59.442
Is this her?

25:59.664 --> 26:00.899
Yes, that's her.

26:01.539 --> 26:03.137
Intellectual Crimes Unit.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.104
They must be after the boss too.

26:05.133 --> 26:06.133
The president?

26:06.156 --> 26:09.500
They normally put pawns as presidents.

26:09.522 --> 26:11.730
Pawns can't be that hot.

26:13.733 --> 26:16.979
We have to catch the boss first,
it's all over if they get him.

26:17.334 --> 26:19.763
Why does it matter who catches first?

26:19.788 --> 26:20.788
Shush!

26:21.362 --> 26:22.695
If the cops get him,

26:22.754 --> 26:27.846
"Officer, I was scammed,
can I get my money back?"

26:28.159 --> 26:29.159
Should I beg?

26:31.403 --> 26:32.284
Oh...

26:32.309 --> 26:35.147
I have to threaten him
to get the money back!

26:36.710 --> 26:37.710
Yes.

26:40.538 --> 26:43.520
This is a spy cam, and a master card key.

26:44.863 --> 26:47.185
My life is now in your hand.

26:49.565 --> 26:50.999
You must catch him.

26:53.357 --> 26:55.374
Infiltrate like water.

26:57.554 --> 27:00.694
Silent like air.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.374
When did she...

27:08.031 --> 27:09.031
Young-sim...

27:10.147 --> 27:12.377
JANG Young-sim!!!

27:14.643 --> 27:16.843
Sir, what's your primary bank?

27:17.263 --> 27:18.463
<i>Don't have one.</i>

27:18.556 --> 27:21.532
Then where do you keep your money?

27:21.766 --> 27:23.769
<i>In the fridge.</i>

27:24.181 --> 27:26.315
You keep them in your fridge?

27:26.389 --> 27:27.589
<i>Because it's cold.</i>

27:28.599 --> 27:30.253
- Where do you reside?
- <i>Samsung.</i>

27:30.268 --> 27:32.157
- Where?
- <i>The fridge.</i>

27:32.853 --> 27:34.253
He lives in a fridge.

27:36.546 --> 27:37.632
Am I funny?

27:39.316 --> 27:40.316
Nope.

27:40.828 --> 27:41.829
Shit!

27:55.729 --> 27:59.174
Hello, this is Estic Capital.

27:59.387 --> 28:00.454
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

28:02.413 --> 28:03.605
No, I am not lying.

28:03.670 --> 28:07.142
We have special interest rate
for our VIP clients...

28:07.186 --> 28:09.536
Special interest rate for VIP...

28:09.849 --> 28:12.078
<i>You said that before.</i>

28:12.916 --> 28:15.537
I called you today for this offer.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.384
Where do you work?

28:17.420 --> 28:20.949
<i>Let me offer you a tip, be more creative.</i>

28:21.014 --> 28:23.946
<i>Something fresh, got that?</i>

28:24.894 --> 28:26.865
<i>Mr. YANG: Don't give up</i>

28:28.159 --> 28:31.702
Hello, this is Estic Capital.

28:32.100 --> 28:35.914
You called us before concerning a loan...

28:35.950 --> 28:37.683
<i>Why do you live like that?</i>

28:37.967 --> 28:38.733
Pardon?

28:38.762 --> 28:41.858
<i>You're phishing, you suck
blood from the people.</i>

28:41.994 --> 28:44.745
I think you're mistaken...

28:44.770 --> 28:48.669
<i>Look into the mirror, what do you see?</i>

28:50.481 --> 28:53.691
<i>What you see there is trash.</i>

28:53.776 --> 28:55.374
<i>Why do you live like that?</i>

28:55.836 --> 28:57.341
<i>I pity your mom.</i>

29:16.593 --> 29:20.101
No need to feel bad,
this isn't God's work.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.711
I was angry and felt guilty too.

29:27.405 --> 29:30.949
Now you're okay?

29:31.148 --> 29:34.273
Can't ask for more
when I get paid this much.

29:35.871 --> 29:38.271
Do you like this work?

29:38.591 --> 29:40.970
Sure, I get regular salary.

29:41.354 --> 29:45.523
I'm going to make a fortune, get
married, have kids, and buy a home too.

29:46.019 --> 29:49.230
You'll feel better when you see the money.

29:53.165 --> 29:54.165
I'm Song-yi.

29:54.564 --> 29:55.750
Welcome.

30:33.307 --> 30:34.307
Hello there.

30:34.351 --> 30:35.217
Good afternoon.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.702
Hello, ma'am.

30:36.780 --> 30:38.960
It's Estic Capital.

30:39.018 --> 30:41.119
No, not a telecom, it's capital.

30:41.191 --> 30:43.399
Hello? Hello?

30:45.336 --> 30:49.301
No, not a private lender,
we're a capital bank.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.078
Why is he swearing...

30:52.103 --> 30:55.440
Please calm down,
I didn't call because of that.

30:55.488 --> 30:57.733
I think you misunderstood.

30:57.882 --> 30:59.090
Say what?

30:59.999 --> 31:00.808
What?

31:00.873 --> 31:02.996
Right, I'm sorry.

31:12.818 --> 31:16.071
If you have just 5 minutes...

31:19.474 --> 31:22.463
You're busy because you're new to farming?

31:23.373 --> 31:24.956
Then, next time...

31:26.299 --> 31:29.885
Why is the cow crying?

31:31.917 --> 31:33.408
You're vaccinating?

31:33.628 --> 31:39.139
You must angle the needle
at 45° to avoid spillage.

31:39.253 --> 31:40.253
Right.

31:41.242 --> 31:42.242
You did!

31:42.627 --> 31:45.842
That's amazing! Congrats! Excellent!

31:47.128 --> 31:51.630
I actually have livestock
instructor license.

31:52.082 --> 31:53.981
No need to thank me.

31:54.159 --> 31:55.664
That's really great.

31:56.439 --> 31:57.439
What?

31:57.483 --> 31:59.997
You want to give us

32:01.623 --> 32:04.982
Yes, input your account there.

32:10.338 --> 32:11.168
Yes.

32:11.212 --> 32:12.878
I should be thanking you.

32:14.471 --> 32:15.685
Did I do okay?

32:25.608 --> 32:27.141
It could've been bad.

32:27.497 --> 32:29.826
Always include all 5 major diseases.

32:29.876 --> 32:32.681
Variable Special contract

33:37.880 --> 33:41.126
<i>Your call cannot be connected...</i>

33:44.179 --> 33:45.712
She went full retard...

34:12.226 --> 34:13.306
What the heck?

34:14.685 --> 34:16.730
What a big cash for a president!

34:34.784 --> 34:35.784
Oh!

34:36.871 --> 34:38.946
I know all about you.

34:39.059 --> 34:40.444
I saw everything.

34:40.629 --> 34:44.315
Handcuff goes rattle, rattle,
siren goes bweep! Right?

34:44.456 --> 34:45.686
No? That was you.

34:45.757 --> 34:48.157
You threw the cuffs, where's the washroom?

34:49.960 --> 34:50.960
Ow, that hurts.

34:52.922 --> 34:54.056
What was that...?

35:30.110 --> 35:32.646
Young-sil, are you okay?

35:33.328 --> 35:34.826
Is your stomach upset?

35:36.226 --> 35:37.226
No.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.727
I'm so fine.

35:40.587 --> 35:42.468
How could I not be?

35:44.848 --> 35:46.708
You're really drunk.

35:47.859 --> 35:49.059
Thank you.

35:50.253 --> 35:51.467

36:44.021 --> 36:45.021
Yes?

36:45.250 --> 36:49.283
<i>I told you to be invisible, not be an MVP!</i>

36:51.244 --> 36:54.546
I didn't do that on purpose,
it just happened.

36:54.710 --> 36:57.577
<i>Your permanent position is all but gone!</i>

36:57.793 --> 37:00.093
No! I'll do better!

37:00.249 --> 37:02.705
<i>I'm going to keep an eye on you!</i>

37:02.777 --> 37:03.777
<i>Got it?!</i>

37:04.659 --> 37:05.659
Yes!

37:10.603 --> 37:11.789
My head...

37:24.177 --> 37:25.370
Who are you?

37:28.155 --> 37:30.349
Why aren't you answering me?

37:30.910 --> 37:33.701
Answer me right away
and don't piss me off.

37:34.007 --> 37:35.007
<i>My apologies.</i>

37:35.101 --> 37:38.112
Did you pull all data from the SIM card?

37:38.217 --> 37:42.217
I'm not a tech support, I can't do it instantly.
<i>(Intellectual Crimes Unit)</i>

37:42.650 --> 37:44.397
- Don't be late.
- Yes, sir.

37:44.689 --> 37:45.853
Just get it done.

37:46.123 --> 37:48.218
- Detective.
- What?

37:48.567 --> 37:52.792
The chief wants you to get
the evidence and pull out quietly.

37:53.638 --> 37:56.869
His balls get smaller as he grows older.

37:57.117 --> 37:59.880
But if it wasn't for him,
you would've gotten the axe.

37:59.909 --> 38:00.909
Or go to jail.

38:00.974 --> 38:04.901
I'm holding back plenty, don't be an ass.

38:05.257 --> 38:06.257
Certainly.

38:06.748 --> 38:08.438
Don't starve yourself.

38:08.837 --> 38:10.437
I'm not into thin girls.

38:10.590 --> 38:12.401
- What did you say?
- I'm hanging up.

38:12.409 --> 38:13.409
Buddy!

38:13.943 --> 38:15.114
What a moron...

38:44.324 --> 38:47.385
You drank quite a bit, is your head okay?

38:48.720 --> 38:49.720
My head?

38:51.291 --> 38:53.230
I feel fine for once.

38:56.298 --> 38:57.548
Never mind then.

39:47.435 --> 39:48.691
Why today...

39:53.258 --> 39:54.593
inspection...

39:57.278 --> 39:58.400
Why...

40:36.984 --> 40:37.984
<i>Where are you?</i>

40:38.009 --> 40:39.713
I'm checking 29th floor.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.530
Baby!

42:13.555 --> 42:17.761
<i>Can you call me 'deputy'
when it's just us?</i>

42:18.040 --> 42:19.040
Yes.

42:19.672 --> 42:23.066
There isn't much here.

42:23.091 --> 42:26.106
And his PC is locked with a password.

42:35.035 --> 42:36.729
It's the perfect angle.

42:37.456 --> 42:38.761
<i>Then I can't see you.</i>

42:38.762 --> 42:39.762
What?

42:40.782 --> 42:43.686
What for? Why'd you see me?

42:43.711 --> 42:45.580
<i>That's not what I meant!</i>

42:46.168 --> 42:47.782
<i>If you're done, get out of there!</i>

42:47.819 --> 42:49.374
Okay, I understand.

42:59.588 --> 43:00.588
Who are you?

43:14.990 --> 43:15.990
What was that?

43:31.632 --> 43:32.632
Who are you?

44:17.063 --> 44:18.063
You little!

44:24.173 --> 44:25.719
Wait, wait, hey!

44:29.415 --> 44:30.415
Hey!

44:37.045 --> 44:38.551
NSA?

44:38.576 --> 44:41.047
Why is NSA investigating a phishing ring?

44:41.173 --> 44:42.173
The thing is...

44:43.969 --> 44:47.200
Whatever, just pull out.

44:47.759 --> 44:48.759
Goddammit...

44:50.782 --> 44:52.438
I worked my ass off to get here.

44:52.463 --> 44:53.844
You can't screw that up!

44:54.409 --> 44:55.690
Goddamn!

45:00.766 --> 45:02.627
What the hell are you doing?!

45:02.659 --> 45:03.734
We got a tail!

45:03.759 --> 45:04.759
What?!

45:08.099 --> 45:09.099
Dammit!

45:09.124 --> 45:10.124
I don't believe this!

45:12.072 --> 45:13.072
Up ahead!

45:29.626 --> 45:30.626
Watch out!

45:43.402 --> 45:44.933
He's still behind us!

45:55.283 --> 45:56.283
Mister!

45:56.883 --> 45:58.744
Did you get my tea?

45:58.769 --> 46:00.463
- Who the fuck?!
- Who are you?

46:00.488 --> 46:02.488
I need the tea to sober up!

46:02.513 --> 46:03.513
I've had it!

46:05.018 --> 46:07.481
Sir, could you hold out for a bit?

46:07.855 --> 46:08.980
Hold out for what?

46:09.040 --> 46:10.240
Okay, let's think.

46:13.653 --> 46:15.631
There, make a right!

46:21.076 --> 46:22.076
Sorry, sorry!

46:37.201 --> 46:39.617
I used to drive a cab.

46:41.129 --> 46:43.011
You ain't too bad.

46:49.561 --> 46:50.561
To our right!

46:56.005 --> 46:57.693
- Do something!
- This is fun!

46:57.718 --> 46:58.972
I'm on it!

46:58.997 --> 46:59.997
That hurts!

47:01.419 --> 47:04.513
Shut up please!
I need to concentrate!

47:10.043 --> 47:11.043
Holy shit!

47:12.832 --> 47:13.832
You dickhead!

47:26.491 --> 47:28.597
- That was so much fun!
- That fuckhead...

48:10.442 --> 48:11.442
Dammit!

48:32.718 --> 48:34.118
Can't even go home...

48:40.890 --> 48:42.038
Good morning.

48:42.968 --> 48:46.509
Intellectual Crimes Unit, Det. NA Jung-an.

48:46.758 --> 48:49.128
Listen to me carefully.

48:49.643 --> 48:50.643
Pull out.

48:51.752 --> 48:52.752
Pull out.

48:54.082 --> 48:55.011
Fuck...

48:55.036 --> 48:56.628
- Did you swear at me?
- Pull out!

48:57.566 --> 48:59.026
Pull the fuck out!

48:59.777 --> 49:00.942
Pull the fuck out!

49:01.503 --> 49:02.884
Incompetent fucks...

49:07.757 --> 49:09.679
Go check the monitor.

49:17.851 --> 49:19.650
Is that because of us?

49:20.357 --> 49:22.769
Did you see the guard?

49:27.048 --> 49:28.048
I'm sorry...

49:33.141 --> 49:34.141
We need to talk.

49:35.379 --> 49:36.379
What for?

49:36.955 --> 49:38.229
I need you to pull out.

49:39.414 --> 49:39.938
What?

49:39.963 --> 49:42.258
I talked sense to your superior.

49:43.488 --> 49:44.488
Did you...

49:45.756 --> 49:46.756
beat him?

49:46.781 --> 49:47.448
Beat who?

49:47.473 --> 49:48.473
Shit!

50:01.084 --> 50:03.304
She's no cop, more like a psycho.

50:07.499 --> 50:09.677
Did she take you by surprise?

50:10.655 --> 50:12.556
You must've been startled.

50:13.370 --> 50:16.444
Allow me to apologize on her behalf.

50:16.657 --> 50:19.867
I'll get to my point,
pull that bitch off the op.

50:20.764 --> 50:22.416
But that's...

50:23.120 --> 50:27.013
You don't need to be rude.

50:27.197 --> 50:31.732
Forget it, I want the
police off this case.

50:46.129 --> 50:51.056
Then you should file
an official complaint.

50:55.766 --> 50:56.766
What?

50:57.123 --> 51:02.898
If you're not doing it officially,
you must be up to something.

51:05.801 --> 51:08.607
Chief GU, NSA is a superior institution.

51:08.632 --> 51:10.317
No good will come out of this.

51:10.342 --> 51:13.854
I don't want to pry either.

51:14.470 --> 51:18.080
So, let's make this a joint op.

51:18.976 --> 51:19.976
Agreed?

51:24.554 --> 51:27.391
Are you two excluding me?

51:27.471 --> 51:30.058
- Well...
- Of course not.

51:30.083 --> 51:31.059
What happened was...

51:31.084 --> 51:37.136
she wanted to know how to manage anger.

51:37.161 --> 51:39.905
She was asking about my secret tactic...

51:42.195 --> 51:44.671
You finally want to make some money!

51:44.931 --> 51:47.299
Yeah, you need to be cool.

51:47.453 --> 51:48.453
Teach me too.

51:48.811 --> 51:49.811
Me first!

51:50.092 --> 51:53.147
I need to know how to manage my anger.

51:53.172 --> 51:54.172
Yes, baby?

51:56.889 --> 51:57.889
Chief GU...

52:00.572 --> 52:01.572
Baby...

52:04.021 --> 52:05.021
"Baby"?

52:05.046 --> 52:08.240
I'll keep it short, this is now a joint op.

52:08.323 --> 52:09.323
Are you mad?!

52:10.930 --> 52:11.930
Baby?

52:12.070 --> 52:15.378
It's either a joint op or no op.

52:15.403 --> 52:18.499
Can't talk to her and she scares me.

52:18.524 --> 52:24.255
I think she has anger
management disability.

52:24.486 --> 52:26.072
<i>Baby, please!</i>

52:26.097 --> 52:27.097
Stop saying "baby"!

52:27.948 --> 52:31.426
That's the final decision,
just follow my order.

52:31.451 --> 52:33.832
I haven't gone postal in a while.

52:33.928 --> 52:35.285
Right, baby?!

52:35.310 --> 52:36.310
Dammit!

52:37.055 --> 52:39.461
I made myself clear.

52:39.547 --> 52:42.792
- Baby? GU?
- Hello?

52:43.514 --> 52:45.959
So it's not anger management.

52:47.820 --> 52:48.820
You two are...

52:51.872 --> 52:54.148
discussing love life?

52:54.173 --> 52:55.349
Right? Right?

52:55.374 --> 52:59.552
That's how you two became close!

53:00.901 --> 53:03.151
<i>Pretend to cooperate, the boss is ours</i>

53:03.176 --> 53:04.608
Relationship is important.

53:07.351 --> 53:10.324
<i>It's fishy, cooperate
and keep an eye on her</i>

53:16.212 --> 53:17.954
Pull out voluntarily.

53:18.665 --> 53:20.661
Can't you do it first?

53:22.165 --> 53:23.752
I'm going to lead!

53:29.139 --> 53:30.600
Good to see you both,

53:30.799 --> 53:33.260
could you come to my office?

53:40.583 --> 53:43.452
Face-to-face phishing?

53:43.477 --> 53:45.281
It's about time you tried it.

53:45.306 --> 53:48.157
Can't I stick to telephone?

53:48.182 --> 53:49.182
Not really.

53:49.784 --> 53:50.784
Out you go.

54:07.215 --> 54:09.285
Seniors don't like me.

54:09.310 --> 54:11.872
We need to earn the trust
of this organization,

54:12.161 --> 54:13.791
so go take the money.

54:15.746 --> 54:16.746
Go on!

54:26.740 --> 54:32.064
Sir, did you get a call from
the Financial Services?

54:32.400 --> 54:34.737
What? I can't hear well.

54:35.216 --> 54:38.685
Did you get a call
from the Financial Services?

54:38.710 --> 54:40.919
Yes, yes.

54:41.074 --> 54:44.851
That's why I brought the money,

54:45.161 --> 54:46.731
but I didn't quite understand...

54:46.756 --> 54:51.951
Your account info is exposed to bad guys.

54:52.857 --> 54:58.726
So the government wants to
protect money in your bank.

54:59.215 --> 55:00.559
Is that so?

55:00.982 --> 55:04.364
I could have been in trouble.

55:04.616 --> 55:08.245
This is for my wife's surgery.

55:08.883 --> 55:09.883
Here.

55:15.250 --> 55:16.250
Um...

55:18.954 --> 55:21.702
Sir, you should just leave.

55:22.376 --> 55:23.376
What did you say?

55:24.029 --> 55:25.666
Just walk away.

55:26.221 --> 55:27.221
What?

55:27.246 --> 55:29.158
Just go, head home!

55:29.183 --> 55:29.955
What?

55:29.980 --> 55:32.488
Get home right now, just go away!

55:32.513 --> 55:33.262
What?

55:33.287 --> 55:34.955
You should head home!

55:35.706 --> 55:37.344
We'll keep it safe for you.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.554
Call us if you need a withdrawal.

55:52.780 --> 55:54.211
Get with the program!

55:54.713 --> 55:56.698
But it's for his wife's surgery...

55:57.879 --> 55:59.858
We're done if they get suspicious.

55:59.883 --> 56:00.652
But still...

56:00.677 --> 56:02.788
We're after the head!

56:02.813 --> 56:05.884
But how can we let the innocent get hurt?

56:05.909 --> 56:06.909
That's why!

56:08.200 --> 56:09.970
That's why we need to catch him!

56:09.995 --> 56:14.021
Excuse me, are you phishing scammers?

56:15.919 --> 56:18.310
We're a bit busy here,

56:18.335 --> 56:20.689
could you look the other way and leave us?

56:20.714 --> 56:22.371
Financial Supervisory? Screw that.

56:22.396 --> 56:25.339
We need a strategy to contact the head.

56:25.364 --> 56:26.881
The poor seniors in town...

56:26.906 --> 56:28.906
We need to gather Intel
from the employees.

56:28.931 --> 56:30.863
- That'll take forever!
- ...for a petty change...

56:30.887 --> 56:33.906
I'm talking here, where are your manners!

56:33.931 --> 56:35.914
Let's just share Intel first.

56:36.230 --> 56:37.792
Give it back when I ask nicely.

56:37.920 --> 56:38.920
Fine.

56:38.945 --> 56:41.275
It's not fine! I'm giving you a warning!

56:41.300 --> 56:42.895
No, I gave you the warning.

56:42.920 --> 56:44.414
Just go the way you came from.

56:44.439 --> 56:45.735
You could get killed!

56:45.760 --> 56:48.624
You go, this is my town!

56:49.320 --> 56:51.306
Dammit, I wish I could hit you!

56:51.331 --> 56:53.052
I gotta do something!

57:10.417 --> 57:11.494
I want to make this clear,

57:11.519 --> 57:14.204
if this op goes south, we're both dead.

57:14.371 --> 57:15.371
Of course!

57:17.772 --> 57:19.025
She works out...

57:20.453 --> 57:21.873
Dang it...

57:32.037 --> 57:33.959
Could we talk?

57:35.013 --> 57:36.772
Over dinner perhaps?

57:41.573 --> 57:43.126
Or a drink?

57:44.990 --> 57:45.990
Or something hot.

58:19.648 --> 58:23.537
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

58:48.683 --> 58:50.320
Move a bit...

58:50.390 --> 58:53.196
more, more, more!

58:54.147 --> 58:55.147
Shit!

58:57.045 --> 58:57.612
Yes?

58:57.637 --> 58:58.637
<i>Evening, deputy.</i>

58:58.662 --> 59:02.011
I got something to help your case.

59:02.244 --> 59:06.019
The burner Chinese account from before?

59:06.044 --> 59:08.169
It resurfaced.

59:08.507 --> 59:09.032
Is that so?

59:09.057 --> 59:12.236
While conducting audit
in prep for restructuring,

59:12.261 --> 59:13.826
Ministry of Justice,

59:13.851 --> 59:16.888
a government branch no less!

59:17.302 --> 59:19.586
<i>They fell victim to voice phishing!</i>

59:22.747 --> 59:26.651
The deputy got disciplined
to some hick town,

59:26.676 --> 59:30.330
maybe it was the director,

59:30.355 --> 59:32.961
and the deputy got fired.

59:34.253 --> 59:35.552
- Fired?
- Yeah.

59:36.738 --> 59:40.865
Getting scammed is not a crime!
Scammers are the criminals!

59:40.890 --> 59:43.075
No one intended to get scammed!

59:43.100 --> 59:44.630
I'm not a pushover!

59:46.009 --> 59:47.009
Deputy?

59:48.568 --> 59:50.523
What's up his ass?!

59:55.158 --> 59:56.846
No, no, no!

59:56.871 --> 59:58.895
Water! No! No!

01:00:05.697 --> 01:00:06.875
Want a rice cake?

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.900
Yup.

01:00:11.058 --> 01:00:12.058
Go on.

01:00:12.083 --> 01:00:15.668
So the boss travels abroad a lot.

01:00:15.766 --> 01:00:16.766
Cheers!

01:00:16.853 --> 01:00:19.772
So, tell me more about the boss.

01:00:33.646 --> 01:00:36.726
I think our boss is a country manager,

01:00:37.489 --> 01:00:39.551
and the chairman...

01:00:39.576 --> 01:00:40.576
Chairman?

01:00:40.633 --> 01:00:43.005
Yeah, I think there is.

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:44.030
Probably.

01:00:44.055 --> 01:00:45.972
Could I meet the chairman?

01:00:46.823 --> 01:00:48.656
I heard he's in China.

01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:50.115
Why is that your concern?

01:00:51.329 --> 01:00:55.041
You know how are check in
and out times are strict?

01:00:55.066 --> 01:00:57.066
It's all because of security.

01:00:57.091 --> 01:01:01.218
I heard that system is
connected all over the world.

01:01:01.531 --> 01:01:03.103
Continue, tell me more.

01:01:05.648 --> 01:01:07.401
I heard there are call centers

01:01:07.426 --> 01:01:11.449
in China and the Philippines.

01:01:12.396 --> 01:01:16.892
I hope to rise to his level soon.

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:18.430
Cheers!

01:01:22.067 --> 01:01:27.433
Has the president worked here a long time?

01:01:28.092 --> 01:01:29.092
Nope.

01:01:29.117 --> 01:01:32.435
He was in the chairman's good grace.

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:34.444
I like your honesty.

01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:39.276
But shouldn't you win me over first?

01:01:39.874 --> 01:01:40.874
How?

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:52.377
I'm not interested in a deal
that doesn't benefit me.

01:01:57.785 --> 01:02:00.712
The chairman must be pretty cool.

01:02:00.737 --> 01:02:03.812
I heard he's a strict person.

01:02:04.163 --> 01:02:06.032
One false move and!

01:02:06.905 --> 01:02:07.905
Seriously?

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:09.368
You're out, so out!

01:02:09.757 --> 01:02:11.563
Where is he?

01:02:12.268 --> 01:02:14.907
No one at the company saw him.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.667
The president probably knows.

01:02:18.365 --> 01:02:20.853
I heard that he's the
chairman's adopted son.

01:02:21.258 --> 01:02:22.258
Adopted son?

01:02:22.897 --> 01:02:27.049
We're going after a whale soon.

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:28.578
A whale?

01:02:28.671 --> 01:02:33.236
If you scored that, you'd be noticed.

01:02:34.782 --> 01:02:39.677
I wonder who'll
take that chance.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.656
When did all my chest
muscles migrate south?

01:03:18.856 --> 01:03:20.790
She'll be shocked.

01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:36.994
Jung-an, did you wait long?

01:03:58.715 --> 01:04:00.035
Were you shocked?

01:04:00.331 --> 01:04:01.331
Yes.

01:04:01.356 --> 01:04:03.928
I was going to shock you
with something else.

01:04:03.953 --> 01:04:06.002
When the swelling cools down...

01:04:06.027 --> 01:04:08.313
Take care of yourself.

01:04:09.482 --> 01:04:11.471
I was going to shock you
with my package...

01:04:12.374 --> 01:04:13.374
Use the room!

01:04:14.158 --> 01:04:15.158
Easy!

01:04:15.258 --> 01:04:16.655
Shower booth is nice...

01:04:19.164 --> 01:04:22.054
From a bar to a hotel with a man...

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:24.550
It's none of your business.

01:04:25.668 --> 01:04:27.803
Don't take me for a delusional hubby.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.999
If I don't believe my wifey, who will?

01:04:32.024 --> 01:04:34.561
- Don't you dare!
- Not again!

01:04:35.282 --> 01:04:37.243
- I came by to give you this!
- What is it?

01:04:37.268 --> 01:04:38.401
The SIM card!

01:04:38.526 --> 01:04:39.526
Oh yeah!

01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:44.189
Something's off about the data.

01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:45.501
What is?

01:04:46.311 --> 01:04:48.470
Only 2 numbers were stored on there.

01:04:49.296 --> 01:04:50.296
Where?

01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:53.329
Deputy YANG and spicy chicken feet.

01:04:54.622 --> 01:04:55.622
Chicken feet?

01:04:58.544 --> 01:05:00.404
I'll do it my damn self.

01:05:35.385 --> 01:05:36.385
Why won't this work?

01:05:42.965 --> 01:05:45.074
Yes, one moment please.

01:05:48.693 --> 01:05:52.134
It's in the car, so I'll send someone.

01:05:52.159 --> 01:05:53.159
Okay.

01:05:54.435 --> 01:05:55.435
Now?

01:05:56.021 --> 01:05:57.342
You want it now?

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.305
Can I send it later?

01:06:04.718 --> 01:06:06.180
You can't wait?

01:06:08.671 --> 01:06:09.671
Okay then,

01:06:12.224 --> 01:06:13.694
I'll come myself.

01:06:34.835 --> 01:06:37.265
YANG and chicken feet?

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:40.666
You find 2 things when you
search a man's phone;

01:06:40.691 --> 01:06:42.190
his work and love life.

01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:45.015
Do you know what this means?

01:06:46.018 --> 01:06:49.791
He works with YANG and loves chicken?

01:06:50.531 --> 01:06:51.911
Or the other way?

01:06:51.936 --> 01:06:55.113
He has 2 phones, it was his secondary.

01:06:55.138 --> 01:06:58.129
Or it could mean he's lonely.

01:06:58.503 --> 01:06:59.503
Seriously?

01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:04.976
Anything from the hidden cam?

01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:07.251
No...

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:10.128
He poured water on it...

01:07:13.311 --> 01:07:16.152
Anything from Mr. YANG?

01:07:16.177 --> 01:07:19.257
He's all talk, not a damn thing.

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:24.743
You're not...

01:07:25.384 --> 01:07:28.400
hiding anything from me, right?

01:07:28.425 --> 01:07:32.309
Why would I hide?

01:07:32.542 --> 01:07:34.542
- And you?
- Never mind.

01:07:39.951 --> 01:07:41.753
She doesn't answer her phone.

01:07:43.217 --> 01:07:44.963
She was never like this.

01:07:46.608 --> 01:07:47.608
Her phone's off.

01:07:54.477 --> 01:07:55.477
What's going on?

01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:58.625
Maybe she really quit.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.650
She needs money for the baby.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:02.494
Can't reach her?

01:08:10.693 --> 01:08:13.471
Go to Eun-jung's place after work today.

01:08:14.408 --> 01:08:16.662
I'm going to try to lure the president.

01:08:17.264 --> 01:08:18.264
Why?

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:20.390
- Why what?
- Huh?

01:08:20.415 --> 01:08:22.415
- Huh what?
- What what?

01:08:22.627 --> 01:08:25.060
- What are you saying?
- What for?

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:57.841
Young-sil!

01:08:58.551 --> 01:08:59.921
Do you want a ride?

01:09:03.558 --> 01:09:04.131
Come on.

01:09:04.156 --> 01:09:05.156
Not hungry,

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.073
and he doesn't like to drink.

01:09:12.292 --> 01:09:13.426
Son of a bitch...

01:09:18.059 --> 01:09:21.973
<i>I know you got nothing to do,
go to Eun-jung's place.</i>

01:09:23.798 --> 01:09:25.983
<i>I got an important work.</i>

01:09:29.474 --> 01:09:32.033
Young-sil, are you hungry?

01:09:33.553 --> 01:09:34.553
Hungry?

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.540
Quite a bit.

01:09:41.602 --> 01:09:44.383
I'll treat our ace, what do you like?

01:09:45.023 --> 01:09:47.446
Japanese? Korean? Chinese?

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:48.917
Um...

01:09:52.035 --> 01:09:53.035
Chicken feet.

01:09:55.296 --> 01:09:57.448
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560
Are you alright?

01:10:07.901 --> 01:10:08.901
Yes, I'm fine.

01:10:09.103 --> 01:10:10.463
Looks like it's too spicy for you.

01:10:10.504 --> 01:10:12.043
It's just right.

01:10:13.659 --> 01:10:14.518
Your sweat.

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.543
Pardon?

01:10:15.568 --> 01:10:16.573
Your neck.

01:10:19.474 --> 01:10:21.488
I get sweaty when I eat spicy stuff.

01:10:23.521 --> 01:10:24.521
So hot...

01:10:34.432 --> 01:10:36.270
Thank you for taking me home.

01:10:36.295 --> 01:10:38.295
Sure, good night.

01:10:45.432 --> 01:10:48.082
Young-sil, one second!

01:11:05.956 --> 01:11:08.209
If you get another craving,
give me a call.

01:11:09.409 --> 01:11:10.409
Yes.

01:11:13.568 --> 01:11:15.110
Have a good weekend.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:16.470
Yes.

01:11:17.837 --> 01:11:18.837
Have a safe drive home.

01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:19.862
Sure.

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.370
Well...

01:11:46.262 --> 01:11:48.874
We met at the bus stop,

01:11:48.899 --> 01:11:50.899
he insisted on taking me home.

01:11:50.924 --> 01:11:52.445
Did I ask?

01:11:54.034 --> 01:11:57.303
Doesn't look like it was just a ride home.

01:11:58.533 --> 01:11:59.533
Well...

01:12:00.526 --> 01:12:03.053
How do I explain this...

01:12:03.078 --> 01:12:05.078
I came for a chat, let's go inside.

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:09.409
Wait, could we go to a cafe instead?

01:12:09.434 --> 01:12:11.348
What for? This is your home.

01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:12.882
Hold on, hold on!

01:12:13.147 --> 01:12:15.150
My place is a dump, let's go to a cafe.

01:12:15.175 --> 01:12:16.175
What's with you?

01:12:16.814 --> 01:12:19.055
I'm begging you, let's go to a cafe.

01:12:35.547 --> 01:12:40.355
You took out the house deposit
and gave it to the grandpa?

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.036
It was for her surgery...

01:12:48.404 --> 01:12:49.808
Come sit down.

01:12:53.931 --> 01:12:55.864
It really is a dump.

01:12:59.369 --> 01:13:00.763
Move into my place.

01:13:01.493 --> 01:13:02.312
No way!

01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:04.375
You can't take responsibility alone!

01:13:07.169 --> 01:13:08.169
Let's go!

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.335
Gosh, do you ever wash your clothes?

01:13:18.838 --> 01:13:19.838
Wear those slippers.

01:13:20.054 --> 01:13:21.054
Hey!

01:13:21.612 --> 01:13:22.612
Hey! Hey!

01:13:22.893 --> 01:13:24.331
Stupid mutt!

01:13:24.611 --> 01:13:27.354
If you shit anywhere, you're so dead!

01:13:31.827 --> 01:13:33.123
What are you doing?

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.563
Telling him not to poop.

01:13:39.137 --> 01:13:40.596
What a load of horse shit...

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:58.000
This is more like an office, than a home.

01:14:02.419 --> 01:14:03.419
So...

01:14:03.887 --> 01:14:05.533
Did you find anything from the president?

01:14:05.563 --> 01:14:06.563
What?

01:14:09.425 --> 01:14:10.425
You know...

01:14:11.275 --> 01:14:13.755
And you?

01:14:14.348 --> 01:14:18.049
Did you meet her at Eun-jung's place?

01:14:22.286 --> 01:14:25.466
They said she hasn't been home.

01:14:25.491 --> 01:14:26.491
What?

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.408
There's something I'm worried about.

01:14:29.433 --> 01:14:30.433
About what?

01:14:31.085 --> 01:14:37.794
<i>The girl I was phishing told me this,</i>

01:14:38.187 --> 01:14:40.544
she lives in a dorm with her baby.

01:14:40.569 --> 01:14:41.569
So what?

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:44.471
Can't you return a third back?

01:14:44.496 --> 01:14:48.625
Her money is paying for
your kid's private kindergarten.

01:14:51.602 --> 01:14:52.602
Even so...

01:14:53.814 --> 01:14:57.362
as a mom, I can't just let it go.

01:14:59.238 --> 01:15:02.469
If you feel guilty, you
shouldn't be doing this.

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:05.042
Mr. YANG...

01:15:05.291 --> 01:15:06.819
What's with you?

01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:08.267
Mr. YANG.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.301
I'll never forgive those
who exploit the weak.

01:15:23.459 --> 01:15:24.459
Fuck!

01:15:25.418 --> 01:15:26.418
I became a cop...

01:15:29.448 --> 01:15:33.914
Anyway, I can never forgive them.

01:15:39.855 --> 01:15:40.855
Jung-an...

01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:47.536
I think you're a good person.

01:15:49.375 --> 01:15:50.375
Come on, please...

01:15:53.959 --> 01:15:56.787
There isn't much here,

01:15:57.339 --> 01:16:00.172
but consider it your home too.

01:16:01.134 --> 01:16:04.066
We're paying for our sins half-half.

01:16:10.045 --> 01:16:11.045
Thank you!

01:16:11.437 --> 01:16:13.437
What's with you? Are you nuts?

01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:16.761
Can we be friends?

01:16:16.786 --> 01:16:19.615
I'm not interested...

01:16:27.486 --> 01:16:29.058
You're so frail...

01:16:31.191 --> 01:16:36.966
I know I'm pathetic...

01:16:37.705 --> 01:16:38.705
That's not...

01:16:40.857 --> 01:16:44.980
Okay, fine, we can be friends...

01:16:45.812 --> 01:16:46.812
Or not.

01:16:48.012 --> 01:16:49.012
Really?

01:16:50.469 --> 01:16:51.469
Thank you!

01:16:52.008 --> 01:16:54.083
So, we're BFFs now?!

01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:55.108
Stop!

01:17:00.779 --> 01:17:01.779
<i>Hello?</i>

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.126
Is this City Hall, innercity department?

01:17:04.127 --> 01:17:05.127
<i>That's correct.</i>

01:17:05.152 --> 01:17:08.219
This is District Prosecutor's office.

01:17:08.407 --> 01:17:11.963
<i>We've received a report
about a corruption charge.</i>

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.370
What do you mean?

01:17:15.395 --> 01:17:17.122
Who told you that I did it?

01:17:17.147 --> 01:17:19.086
This lady must be mad.

01:17:19.467 --> 01:17:22.105
<i>Is this a voice phishing?</i>

01:17:22.486 --> 01:17:23.231
Yes.

01:17:23.256 --> 01:17:27.159
You're all pests who rip off
money from innocent folks.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:30.622
You used escort service 7 times,

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.853
<i>and visited brothels 3 times.</i>

01:17:32.878 --> 01:17:34.849
Does your family know?

01:17:35.177 --> 01:17:38.408
Did you have a good time?

01:17:38.433 --> 01:17:40.433
<i>I think there's been a misunderstanding.</i>

01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:41.458
Bullshit.

01:17:41.483 --> 01:17:45.225
<i>From builders to contractors,</i>

01:17:45.258 --> 01:17:46.891
you siphoned money from everyone.

01:17:46.916 --> 01:17:50.452
Just from a few, that's hardly everyone.

01:17:50.477 --> 01:17:53.488
If you keep this up,
I'm going to report you!

01:17:53.513 --> 01:17:54.513
Okay, you should.

01:17:54.538 --> 01:17:59.723
When we get arrested,
we'll take the list with us.

01:18:00.415 --> 01:18:04.861
It's from the brothel,
so it's quite accurate.

01:18:04.886 --> 01:18:07.156
Ma'am, what is your name?

01:18:07.181 --> 01:18:10.389
What for? Gonna bribe me too?

01:18:10.414 --> 01:18:11.414
So what?!

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.511
How much would you like?

01:18:19.887 --> 01:18:21.979
I feel so good!

01:18:23.176 --> 01:18:24.775
Bottom's up!

01:18:36.348 --> 01:18:37.348
Drink, drink!

01:18:44.335 --> 01:18:46.021
Take a selfie!

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.666
One, two, three!

01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:30.711
BFF...

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:34.705
until end of time...

01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:35.730
Of course.

01:19:39.997 --> 01:19:40.997
Ticklish!

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:52.686
Hey!

01:19:53.432 --> 01:19:54.756
Why didn't you stop me?!

01:19:54.781 --> 01:19:57.715
It was your idea.

01:19:59.302 --> 01:20:00.302
Sorry.

01:20:13.573 --> 01:20:14.573
"BABY"

01:20:24.299 --> 01:20:27.367
<i>You're not even going to report back?!</i>

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.047
<i>Keep it up and no more permanent position!</i>

01:20:32.072 --> 01:20:35.553
<i>If you want the job, get me a solid lead!</i>

01:20:35.578 --> 01:20:40.123
<i>Do it right, I'm not going down alone!</i>

01:21:05.017 --> 01:21:06.399
<i>JANG Young-si</i>

01:21:11.818 --> 01:21:13.556
Attention, please!

01:21:13.941 --> 01:21:15.941
You may've already heard,

01:21:16.551 --> 01:21:20.696
we sometimes go after big whales.

01:21:21.614 --> 01:21:24.162
National Police, NSA,

01:21:24.452 --> 01:21:27.538

<i>JANG was a contractor for a year
and was let go a month ago.</i>

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.022
<i>It smells fishy.</i>

01:21:38.423 --> 01:21:40.423
I'm taking volunteers.

01:21:40.448 --> 01:21:41.448
That sounds juicy...

01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:43.910
Anyone?

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.007
Good.

01:21:48.032 --> 01:21:48.633
It's out of our league.

01:21:48.658 --> 01:21:49.133
Anyone else?

01:21:49.158 --> 01:21:51.076
The deeper we go,
the faster we solve this.

01:21:51.101 --> 01:21:52.101
No one?

01:21:52.251 --> 01:21:53.251
Volunteer!

Yes?

01:22:00.184 --> 01:22:01.820
<i>Colonel, it's Chief of Staff.</i>

01:22:01.845 --> 01:22:02.845
Pardon?

01:22:03.062 --> 01:22:05.062
<i>I'm the Army Chief of Staff!</i>

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.897
Salute, sir!

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.309
It's about 3Q expenses,

01:22:09.944 --> 01:22:13.592
I'm told it increased
due to private contracts.

01:22:13.816 --> 01:22:15.186
I don't understand...

01:22:15.187 --> 01:22:16.577
<i>That's not possible.</i>

The costs shot up by 20-80%!

01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:26.762
That cannot be, sir.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.600
You son of a bitch!

01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:33.348
The prosecution is talking
about corruption charges!

01:22:33.512 --> 01:22:35.280
You want to go to prison for this?!

01:22:36.207 --> 01:22:37.658
I'm sorry, sir.

01:22:37.683 --> 01:22:42.561
This could be covered up from my end.

01:22:42.898 --> 01:22:47.153
You got a star to look forward to.

01:22:47.178 --> 01:22:48.200
Isn't that right?

01:22:48.225 --> 01:22:51.529
<i>If you forgive me,
I'll do anything for you.</i>

01:22:51.554 --> 01:22:56.125
Good, we're all prone to mistakes.

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:06.291
Deputy, it must be a big one.

01:23:06.801 --> 01:23:07.801
How big?

01:23:08.101 --> 01:23:10.692
Probably over $500,000.

01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:16.127
Listen, this is our chance.

01:23:16.627 --> 01:23:19.011
When you receive the money,
bring it to me.

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:22.257
With that money, it's all over, the end!

01:23:22.282 --> 01:23:27.347
What about Jung-an? What'll happen to her?

01:23:27.372 --> 01:23:30.807
Stop! How long will you do this for?

01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:32.256
<i>Look out for yourself.</i>

01:23:32.322 --> 01:23:34.612

JANG, listen carefully.

01:23:36.693 --> 01:23:41.808
Bring that money, and you got a job.

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:42.833
A permanent position.

01:23:44.413 --> 01:23:46.413

01:23:48.536 --> 01:23:51.546
Yes, I understand.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:23:59.667
Okay.

01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:21.530
What?

01:24:22.542 --> 01:24:24.542
Hiding something?

01:24:25.177 --> 01:24:26.617
No.

01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:31.650
You must have had
a lot of experience as a cop.

01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:33.709
But me...

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:36.027
You're a NSA agent.

01:24:36.802 --> 01:24:40.183
You're on another level.

01:24:42.107 --> 01:24:45.415
Well, I suppose so.

01:25:35.489 --> 01:25:38.311
Is the Chief of Staff really mad?

01:25:39.702 --> 01:25:42.473
We're here on an errand, sir.

01:25:42.724 --> 01:25:46.429
He didn't have a message?

01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:47.950
No, sir.

01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:51.745
Just to fetch the briefcase.

01:25:56.337 --> 01:25:57.337
Then...

01:25:58.871 --> 01:26:01.364
Leaving already?

01:26:02.077 --> 01:26:06.166
Stay for some tea,
I got some questions too.

01:26:06.693 --> 01:26:08.693
The Chief is waiting, sir.

01:26:10.452 --> 01:26:11.452
Yeah?

01:26:13.232 --> 01:26:15.232
On your way, then.

01:26:25.761 --> 01:26:27.327
Salute.

01:26:35.766 --> 01:26:36.766
Hold.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.158
So...

01:26:48.008 --> 01:26:50.413
What's the Chief's background?

01:26:51.948 --> 01:26:52.948
Background?

01:26:55.016 --> 01:26:56.687
Well...

01:26:57.271 --> 01:27:00.594
that's classified information...

01:27:08.738 --> 01:27:11.107
Right? I thought so.

01:27:11.132 --> 01:27:13.670
I shouldn't have asked.

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:17.342
Tell him I'll visit him soon.

01:27:17.367 --> 01:27:18.367
Got that?

01:27:18.781 --> 01:27:19.781
Yes, sir!

01:27:20.212 --> 01:27:21.212
Salute!

01:27:23.334 --> 01:27:24.334
Salute.

01:27:24.689 --> 01:27:26.385
Okay, go on.

01:27:48.374 --> 01:27:49.374
What?

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:51.332
About what?

01:27:54.233 --> 01:27:56.348
- Did you...
- What?

01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:58.839
Are you really...

01:27:59.422 --> 01:28:01.422
Oops, I'm sorry.

01:28:03.725 --> 01:28:04.537

01:28:04.562 --> 01:28:05.588
I'm sorry!

01:28:05.628 --> 01:28:06.628
Hey!

01:28:06.726 --> 01:28:08.244
Stop!

01:28:13.167 --> 01:28:14.825
Let's talk!

01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:17.519
Stop right there!

01:28:31.235 --> 01:28:32.597
JANG Young-sil!

01:28:37.972 --> 01:28:39.669
You okay?

01:28:55.619 --> 01:28:57.150

01:28:57.182 --> 01:28:58.360

01:28:59.695 --> 01:29:01.375
Don't do this!

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.400
Help me up!

01:29:03.038 --> 01:29:05.038
Common!

01:29:09.181 --> 01:29:11.338
Young-sil! You really...

01:29:23.805 --> 01:29:26.657
Chief, we need to raid the HQ right away.

01:29:26.690 --> 01:29:27.690
<i>What? Now?</i>

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:33.155
Who the hell?

01:29:33.382 --> 01:29:34.502
One second.

01:29:41.838 --> 01:29:43.263
What is it?

01:29:48.797 --> 01:29:52.528
Intellectual Crimes Unit, Det. NA Jung-an.

01:29:53.157 --> 01:29:55.911
Undercover work must've been tough.

01:29:57.535 --> 01:30:00.407
Where's the NSA agent?

01:30:03.518 --> 01:30:04.864
It's really hot today.

01:30:05.248 --> 01:30:08.636
Make her feel every hit.

01:30:16.233 --> 01:30:17.233
Hit it.

01:30:29.844 --> 01:30:31.967
You bastard!

01:30:38.845 --> 01:30:39.845
Let go!

01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:41.120
<i>Det. NA?</i>

01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:43.145
Let go of me, you fucks!

01:30:45.501 --> 01:30:48.064
Too bad she's a cop.

01:31:03.203 --> 01:31:04.203
Hey, boss?

01:31:04.228 --> 01:31:05.659
I'm mission complete.

01:31:05.684 --> 01:31:06.522
I'll go back. Okay?

01:31:06.547 --> 01:31:08.730
Okay, off you go.

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:10.755
I'll buy you a round before your next op.

01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.780
Yap. Good to see you.

01:31:17.853 --> 01:31:19.853
Damn smart dude.

01:31:22.348 --> 01:31:23.348
Oops.

01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:34.703
Come, sit.

01:31:54.856 --> 01:31:55.856
Dang it.

01:31:57.315 --> 01:31:59.119
The filter's messed up.

01:32:04.079 --> 01:32:06.079
This isn't fair.

01:32:07.235 --> 01:32:08.939
What about my job?

01:32:08.964 --> 01:32:10.964
Don't be so naive.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.950
Did you really believe that?

01:32:14.952 --> 01:32:17.362
It's gotta be a permanent position.

01:32:17.623 --> 01:32:21.277
You know what I've been through!

01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:26.015
Deputy! Please give me another chance!

01:32:26.766 --> 01:32:29.242
I'll do whatever it takes!

01:32:29.267 --> 01:32:31.252
Just one more chance!

01:32:31.277 --> 01:32:33.277
I'm begging you!

01:32:33.793 --> 01:32:35.010
Ms. JANG.

01:32:35.862 --> 01:32:37.868
This is the real world.

01:32:37.893 --> 01:32:42.581
Once a temp, forever a temp.

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:52.715
So you never intended to hire me?

01:32:52.979 --> 01:32:55.067
Isn't that obvious?

01:32:59.202 --> 01:33:01.202
How can I trust you?

01:33:02.729 --> 01:33:05.694
You used me for this...

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.774
You're going to regret this.

01:33:15.052 --> 01:33:16.249
Step aside.

01:33:24.481 --> 01:33:27.367
Sorry, Young-sil.

01:33:39.662 --> 01:33:41.662
Det. WON, over there,

01:33:41.687 --> 01:33:42.655
Det. LEE, that office.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.086
What in the world?

01:33:44.111 --> 01:33:47.075
Can't reach NA, what's going on?

01:33:48.284 --> 01:33:50.948
Do you think something happened to her?

01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:53.641
Chief, don't even say it!

01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:54.934
You prick.

01:33:55.261 --> 01:33:58.451
What happened to that NSA agent?

01:33:59.466 --> 01:34:01.204
She's unreachable either.

01:34:01.477 --> 01:34:03.477
I'll look into NSA.

01:34:06.163 --> 01:34:07.163
Well, well!

01:34:10.627 --> 01:34:13.908
It's over! Over!

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:23.362
Seeing you, makes me happy!

01:34:23.387 --> 01:34:26.666
Let's take a look at you!

01:34:42.947 --> 01:34:45.866
<i>So you never intended to hire me?</i>

01:34:45.891 --> 01:34:47.891
<i>Isn't that obvious?</i>

01:34:48.068 --> 01:34:50.213
<i>How can I trust you?</i>

01:34:52.731 --> 01:34:53.731
Phone...

01:34:58.568 --> 01:34:59.752
Young-sil...

01:34:59.999 --> 01:35:00.760
<i>The phone is currently off...</i>

01:35:00.785 --> 01:35:01.785
Come on!

01:35:01.914 --> 01:35:03.814
Answer me!

01:35:06.599 --> 01:35:08.599
Young-sin, why are you doing this to me?

01:35:08.768 --> 01:35:10.768
JANG Young-sil!

01:35:28.915 --> 01:35:30.724
Ms. Jang.

01:35:31.249 --> 01:35:33.165
Where's Jung-an?

01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:35.685
Is she okay?

01:35:37.077 --> 01:35:40.508
I was pondering what I should do to her.

01:35:41.642 --> 01:35:43.642
What should I do?

01:35:45.437 --> 01:35:46.932
Lose some weight!

01:35:54.777 --> 01:35:58.277
You'll have lighter steps
if you lose some.

01:35:58.717 --> 01:36:00.644
Right? Run faster too.

01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:01.669
Right.

01:36:07.624 --> 01:36:08.624
What?

01:36:09.095 --> 01:36:10.699
Got a problem?

01:36:11.115 --> 01:36:12.591
Is that it?

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440
Want to go?

01:36:19.646 --> 01:36:21.699
I'll beat your ass.

01:36:47.006 --> 01:36:48.803
You're all dead.

01:36:55.624 --> 01:36:57.624
Yes, she's well.

01:36:57.649 --> 01:37:00.512
She's flapping around
like a fish out of water.

01:37:01.474 --> 01:37:02.899
Let me go!

01:37:03.205 --> 01:37:07.007
Would you like to hear her voice?

01:37:10.306 --> 01:37:12.320
<i>Hello? Jung-an?</i>

01:37:12.784 --> 01:37:14.913
<i>I'm sorry, I really am.</i>

01:37:14.938 --> 01:37:17.244
<i>It's all my fault, I'll be there to...</i>

01:37:17.269 --> 01:37:19.094
Shut the hell up!

01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:22.507
You backstabbed me!

01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:24.508
<i>Anyhow,</i>

01:37:24.533 --> 01:37:28.226
if you come here, I'll kill you myself.

01:37:28.251 --> 01:37:29.251
Got it?!

01:37:29.839 --> 01:37:31.539
Okay, I'll be there soon, please wait.

01:37:31.564 --> 01:37:34.471
Please, don't come!

01:37:34.826 --> 01:37:36.547
I'm telling you, don't come here!

01:37:36.572 --> 01:37:38.106
That'd be no fun.

01:37:38.131 --> 01:37:40.536
<i>Jung-an? Hello?</i>

01:37:40.561 --> 01:37:44.240
Young-sil, time's running out,
please hurry.

01:37:45.623 --> 01:37:48.576
<i>...drowned bodies are found in the river,</i>

01:37:48.601 --> 01:37:51.681
<i>the police are looking to ID the bodies.</i>

01:37:51.706 --> 01:37:55.102
<i>The bodies have been
in the water for 2 to 4 days...</i>

01:38:00.419 --> 01:38:02.419
Jesus...

01:38:08.252 --> 01:38:09.469
There you go.

01:38:32.663 --> 01:38:34.316
Jung-an!

01:38:43.562 --> 01:38:45.562
I told you not to come.

01:38:45.587 --> 01:38:47.587
But we're friends.

01:38:48.381 --> 01:38:50.537
I'm sorry.

01:38:51.145 --> 01:38:52.145
Crazy bitch...

01:38:55.841 --> 01:38:57.224
Bitches...

01:38:59.446 --> 01:39:01.603
You're all dead.

01:39:02.931 --> 01:39:05.958
Chief, he's heading for the harbor.

01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:08.166
Maybe they're smuggling
out of the country.

01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:10.190
Yeah? Stay on his ass.

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:11.300
Let's move!

01:39:13.262 --> 01:39:14.698
You promised.

01:39:14.856 --> 01:39:16.510
You believed him?

01:39:16.535 --> 01:39:17.988
I didn't make any promises.

01:39:18.708 --> 01:39:20.927
And you're the one who deceived us.

01:39:21.279 --> 01:39:24.087
You pretended to be kind and weak,

01:39:24.112 --> 01:39:26.112
then took off with the money alone.

01:39:26.137 --> 01:39:27.686
No work ethics.

01:39:29.195 --> 01:39:30.195
Damn you...

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:34.733
The boat is coming in, Mr. Chairman.

01:39:36.075 --> 01:39:37.075
What?

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:40.045
You're the chairman?

01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:41.597
What exactly are you?

01:39:41.622 --> 01:39:44.679
You bastard, I should've killed you.

01:39:46.951 --> 01:39:48.428
You piece of shit!

01:39:48.453 --> 01:39:50.453
I don't believe this!

01:39:51.498 --> 01:39:52.829
Come here!

01:39:55.797 --> 01:39:58.449
My apologies, I'll head out first.

01:40:03.121 --> 01:40:05.849
Where you going? Get back here!

01:40:07.331 --> 01:40:09.824
Young-sil, you know something?

01:40:10.057 --> 01:40:13.855
Nonstop kindness is being stupid.

01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:22.227
Perverted bastard.

01:40:23.226 --> 01:40:25.678
I agree with him though.

01:40:25.703 --> 01:40:26.703
Unleash them.

01:40:27.273 --> 01:40:28.855
- Too bad.
- Dogs?

01:40:40.443 --> 01:40:42.706
Let's go over there, get up.

01:40:42.746 --> 01:40:43.746
Why?

01:40:44.098 --> 01:40:45.098
Joint op!

01:40:49.033 --> 01:40:50.033
One...

01:40:50.393 --> 01:40:51.393
Two!

01:41:03.251 --> 01:41:04.251
Let's go.

01:41:04.848 --> 01:41:06.363
One, two.

01:41:06.587 --> 01:41:08.587
One, two.

01:41:12.262 --> 01:41:13.689
Bastards!

01:41:23.426 --> 01:41:25.453
One, two.

01:41:28.067 --> 01:41:32.434
One, two, one, two...

01:41:44.417 --> 01:41:45.417
Eh?

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:48.631
I was an assistant to a magician.

01:41:48.656 --> 01:41:50.496
What the hell were we doing?

01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:10.270
Hey, mutt, go home if you want to live.

01:42:10.595 --> 01:42:12.595
Don't go any closer!

01:42:13.092 --> 01:42:14.092
Stop! Stop!

01:42:14.798 --> 01:42:17.653
That dog won't let go once it bites.

01:42:17.678 --> 01:42:19.233
That's why it's dangerous!

01:42:19.258 --> 01:42:20.741
Give me a second.

01:42:31.409 --> 01:42:33.155
It's right on time.

01:42:49.972 --> 01:42:51.646
Young-sil...

01:43:02.156 --> 01:43:03.960
Hey, hey!

01:43:15.223 --> 01:43:18.346
Animals or people, all males are the same.

01:43:18.997 --> 01:43:23.134
I actually have an animal
whispering certificate.

01:43:32.247 --> 01:43:34.247
Jung-an, you okay?

01:43:48.858 --> 01:43:49.858
Come on!

01:43:51.661 --> 01:43:53.229
What is it?

01:44:03.076 --> 01:44:04.076
That bitch!

01:44:05.066 --> 01:44:06.596
Get her!

01:44:10.528 --> 01:44:11.990
He fired at me?

01:44:13.098 --> 01:44:15.098
Get the boat back.

01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:23.207
Damn it!

01:44:25.035 --> 01:44:26.422
Freeze!

01:44:56.694 --> 01:44:58.696
JANG Young-sil!

01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:02.786
You have to go, sir.

01:45:06.823 --> 01:45:07.538
Dang it!

01:45:07.563 --> 01:45:09.495
Hey! Get me out of here first!

01:45:09.667 --> 01:45:11.667
Son of a bitch!

01:45:11.890 --> 01:45:13.464
Split up and find them!

01:45:13.489 --> 01:45:14.097
Yes, sir!

01:45:14.122 --> 01:45:15.122
On the double!

01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:17.589
Police!

01:45:18.003 --> 01:45:19.003
Freeze!

01:45:22.303 --> 01:45:24.773
Finish him, alright?

01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:28.741
Can't he warn us before shooting?

01:45:29.042 --> 01:45:30.042
Kill him!

01:45:43.484 --> 01:45:45.484
I'm so friggin' tired.

01:46:11.034 --> 01:46:12.047
Bring the car around.

01:46:12.072 --> 01:46:13.072
Yes, sir!

01:46:13.861 --> 01:46:15.341
- Take care of this.
- Take care of this.

01:46:15.365 --> 01:46:16.365
Yes, sir!

01:46:17.112 --> 01:46:18.112
Should I go too?

01:46:30.730 --> 01:46:32.448
Mr. YANG!

01:46:32.473 --> 01:46:33.473
Fuck, what now?!

01:46:39.628 --> 01:46:41.682
My money!

01:46:43.106 --> 01:46:45.106
It's... my money, goddammit!

01:46:49.451 --> 01:46:51.655
Why's he shooting at everything!

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:54.001
Act like a chairman! That bratty bastard!

01:46:54.026 --> 01:46:56.587
My money, my money...

01:47:03.672 --> 01:47:06.876
Isn't it my time to shock you?

01:47:16.646 --> 01:47:17.646
Ruptured...

01:47:17.671 --> 01:47:19.101
Moron...

01:47:22.092 --> 01:47:23.926
Come on! Get over here!

01:47:23.951 --> 01:47:25.951
Get me out at once!

01:47:28.065 --> 01:47:29.907
Let go of me, you pricks!

01:47:29.939 --> 01:47:31.677
What's going on? Let me go!

01:47:31.702 --> 01:47:33.795
Are you cops? What's your affiliation?

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:36.876
- Let's talk at the station!
- No need! Let me go!

01:47:41.218 --> 01:47:43.512
CHOI Min-suk! Stop the car!

01:47:43.998 --> 01:47:45.700
Step on it.

01:50:01.651 --> 01:50:03.484
Young-sil.

01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:08.884
You have a knack for surprising people.

01:50:09.578 --> 01:50:12.099
You should give yourself up.

01:50:12.124 --> 01:50:15.566
You may be able to mitigate this.

01:50:19.410 --> 01:50:22.306
Want to hear a funny story?

01:50:25.077 --> 01:50:30.098
A drunken driver's Ferrari
smashed into a pickup truck.

01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:34.519
The truck driver died on the spot,

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:39.083
and perp was set free because
he was son of a rich prick.

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:42.801
Despite having 3 witnesses,

01:50:43.097 --> 01:50:46.376
they all lied under oath.

01:50:47.332 --> 01:50:51.431
No more witnesses, and misplaced evidence,

01:50:55.041 --> 01:50:57.238
so my innocent father...

01:50:59.175 --> 01:51:01.175
became the perpetrator.

01:51:08.292 --> 01:51:09.736
Stay back!

01:51:11.423 --> 01:51:12.769
Stay back, please.

01:51:12.794 --> 01:51:14.592
Don't come any closer!

01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:23.637
You took away jobs from innocent people.

01:51:25.068 --> 01:51:28.537
This job was life to Song-yi.

01:51:29.378 --> 01:51:31.378
But I...

01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.520
That way!

01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:44.682
CHOI Min-suk!

01:51:44.959 --> 01:51:47.797
It's all over! Give it up!

01:51:49.610 --> 01:51:50.628
Son of a bitch!

01:51:50.653 --> 01:51:52.886
Don't just stand around,

01:51:52.911 --> 01:51:54.911
could you be a darling and get me a car?

01:51:54.936 --> 01:51:55.648
You!

01:51:55.761 --> 01:51:58.902
Shut your damn hole!

01:52:03.889 --> 01:52:05.340
Jung-an, please.

01:52:05.365 --> 01:52:06.100
Calm down!

01:52:06.217 --> 01:52:07.862
You should learn to manage your anger.

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:11.221
If you harm her in any way,

01:52:12.053 --> 01:52:13.448
I'll kill you myself!

01:52:16.739 --> 01:52:19.346
That's not what's important right now!

01:52:19.371 --> 01:52:22.299
What's the big deal with her?!

01:52:22.324 --> 01:52:24.324
She's nothing!

01:52:24.607 --> 01:52:27.074
- What?
- That fucker...

01:52:35.292 --> 01:52:36.292
Jung-an!

01:52:38.837 --> 01:52:40.311
Det. NA, don't!

01:52:40.414 --> 01:52:41.610
No!

01:52:58.058 --> 01:53:01.455
Why are you all pissing me off?!

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:05.602
Are you brushing me off
because I'm a temp?!

01:53:11.012 --> 01:53:13.601
- Get them in the car!
- Get inside!

01:53:15.881 --> 01:53:17.721
Don't be a crybaby.

01:53:17.753 --> 01:53:18.753
Let's go!

01:53:20.850 --> 01:53:22.850
To the ER... please...

01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:31.300
What'll you do now?

01:53:33.241 --> 01:53:35.241
I'm not sure.

01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:39.002
Just for today, I don't want to think.

01:53:40.955 --> 01:53:42.955
What else are you good at?

01:53:43.148 --> 01:53:45.148
You're like an onion with so many layers.

01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:47.257
That's nothing at all.

01:53:47.836 --> 01:53:49.289
Sorry.

01:53:50.457 --> 01:53:52.833
'Sorry' is a habit,
you're not sorry at all.

01:53:53.028 --> 01:53:55.501
Not at all, I really am sorry.

01:53:58.508 --> 01:54:00.378
Sorry.

01:54:00.403 --> 01:54:03.121
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

01:54:03.497 --> 01:54:05.722
I'm serious.

01:54:08.481 --> 01:54:10.481
How's the tattoo? Still there?

01:54:12.092 --> 01:54:13.606
Of course.

01:54:13.685 --> 01:54:14.685
And yours?

01:54:14.921 --> 01:54:16.895
- Of course!
- Show me.

01:54:17.867 --> 01:54:19.467
How about a greeting?

01:54:30.057 --> 01:54:33.353
Lock eyes with them and try to talk.

01:54:41.697 --> 01:54:45.004
<i>How To Talk to Dogs</i>

01:54:45.577 --> 01:54:47.577
Let's try once more.

01:54:56.955 --> 01:54:58.955
That's the end of class today.

01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:01.364
Prep for a test tomorrow.

01:55:01.389 --> 01:55:04.866
Great work today! I got an emergency...
