00:33.992 --> 00:37.611
Now, can we... Whoa, hold it.
They're still lighting.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.659
Right. Stand by.

00:41.625 --> 00:45.039
Gordon, would you talk, and,
um, Bruce, if you could just nod.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.206
Yeah.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.882
This is the story of a young man
from New Zealand who was so successful

00:55.013 --> 00:59.678
at driving cars that he came to Europe
to branch out as a professional driver.

01:00.852 --> 01:06.018
As a designer, and as a businessman,
last year McLaren exported racing cars

01:06.149 --> 01:09.233
worth one and a quarter million dollars.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.167
Bruce McLaren driving in his 100th
Grand Prix at the age of only 32.

01:44.104 --> 01:48.189
Bruce storms back to make it
a sensational McLaren one-two.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.312
McLaren seems to choose any line

01:51.445 --> 01:54.563
in a daring drive
rarely seen in motor racing.

01:55.073 --> 01:59.033
McLaren crew chief Tyler Alexander
looks happy, wouldn't you say?

02:04.708 --> 02:07.667
Bruce, you're competing on
the world's motor racing circuits,

02:07.794 --> 02:11.834
and beating people who've got far,
far more money to spend than you have.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.333
Would you be much better if you had four
or five times as much money to spend?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.506
No. We'd probably get in a terrible mess.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.055
You can get too big as a racing team,

02:22.184 --> 02:24.551
and you could get involved and hidebound.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.599
You've got to be able to move quickly
if you're going to be competitive.

02:30.901 --> 02:35.441
But the actual care with which pieces
are put together is very important.

02:35.572 --> 02:40.283
Something done incorrectly or assembled
in a hurry can be very dangerous.

03:33.422 --> 03:38.508
When I was a boy, Mum remembers
hearing me telling a fantail:

03:38.635 --> 03:42.754
"When I grow up
I'm gonna be a racing car driver."

03:58.405 --> 04:01.318
We're gonna talk about...
We're gonna talk about Bruce,

04:01.450 --> 04:04.693
the human interest side of it, really.
Yeah, which I think is a good idea.

04:08.415 --> 04:14.286
You know what it's like when you meet
somebody and there's an instant rapport.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.673
He was a very hands-on person,

04:18.800 --> 04:23.966
learning about the mechanics of cars
at his pop's service station in Remuera.

04:24.097 --> 04:29.092
We learned how to repair cars, put cars
together, build things, make things.

04:31.772 --> 04:36.642
We were always together.
His friendship was simply unconditional.

04:37.486 --> 04:42.527
His sense of humor was never
far behind him. It was like a shadow.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.030
Motor racing was what we lived for.

04:51.041 --> 04:54.910
Bruce's father had a pretty
extensive career in motorsport himself,

04:55.045 --> 04:56.536
from the 1930s.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.456
Wives and friends signal drivers

04:59.591 --> 05:01.423
how far they've gone and their position.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.214
Some keen spectators follow the race
in the same way,

05:04.346 --> 05:05.962
whilst others just watch the cars go by,

05:06.097 --> 05:09.431
and wonder why on earth people
would want to do this sort of thing.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.812
Pop McLaren obviously wanted Bruce
to follow in his footsteps,

05:14.940 --> 05:18.024
and Bruce absolutely loved it.

05:18.151 --> 05:24.569
It was always in his mind
from the time he was a boy.

05:24.699 --> 05:29.034
And yet he must have been
in severe discomfort

05:29.162 --> 05:32.701
most of the time, strapped to that frame.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.875
Bruce had an illness from childhood,
which had left him crippled.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.372
We called him the Crippled Kid.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.795
We thought he had polio.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.343
All types of cripples
from all over New Zealand

05:49.474 --> 05:52.342
comprise the 73 patients at
the Wilson Home for Crippled Children

05:52.477 --> 05:54.343
at Takapuna, Auckland.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.978
At nine and a half I contracted
Perthes Disease.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.943
The ball joint in my left hip
was breaking down.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.147
To immobilize the hip,
they strapped me to a frame

06:06.283 --> 06:08.275
and dangled weights from my legs.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.533
A specialist said
I'd be laid up for several months.

06:13.331 --> 06:17.996
He lay on that frame for two years,

06:18.128 --> 06:21.121
never came off it.

06:21.256 --> 06:27.218
Was educated on it, and washed
and fed on it, and the whole lot.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.638
One leg was always shorter than the other.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.134
And he limped badly,

06:35.270 --> 06:37.933
and couldn't play rugby or cricket
like other kids.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.858
- Can you hit anything?
- Sometimes.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.273
Your piece, yeah.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.568
And shoot.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.455
Damn it.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.866
Can I move?

06:59.002 --> 07:01.790
Move? What the hell you mean, move?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.379
I'm better when I move.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.135
During these formative years,

07:17.270 --> 07:20.434
Pop could see
Bruce's extraordinary natural ability.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.981
And he'd give us little lessons
about lines through corners

07:26.112 --> 07:28.104
and things to observe.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.118
It was Les that always said
that when Bruce beats his times,

07:34.245 --> 07:35.531
he becomes the driver.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.584
New Zealand didn't have that many
sporting events in those days,

07:41.711 --> 07:46.001
and people would drive anywhere
to watch guys hurtling around.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.263
We did a lot of races together,

07:54.391 --> 07:56.553
all over the North Island
and South Island.

08:01.356 --> 08:04.724
And then when the Grand Prix, the
New Zealand International Grand Prix,

08:04.859 --> 08:09.524
started,
that became an extraordinary event.

08:12.367 --> 08:16.031
I mean, there were 70,000 people there
on the first day.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.582
The New Zealand Grand Prix
was an opportunity

08:22.711 --> 08:26.625
for Bruce to race against
the best drivers in the world.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.843
People like Jim Clark, Jack Brabham,
and Stirling Moss.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.014
These guys were the Spitfire pilots
of the 50s and 60s.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.763
The pin-up boys.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.358
In New Zealand racing drivers
are regarded with a special sort of awe.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.278
And if they happen to be overseas drivers,

08:51.406 --> 08:53.693
the awe develops into hero worship.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.239
That's how I regarded Jack Brabham.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.747
Jack Brabham kept his race car
at Pop's service station,

09:01.875 --> 09:06.415
so he became a friend of the family,
and Bruce's mentor.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.833
Bruce was an extremely good driver and
he had the talent that was born in him.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.302
Motor racing's not something you just
suddenly learn out of the blue.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.219
You've got to have it inside,
and you've got to have a feel for it,

09:19.350 --> 09:21.717
and Bruce certainly had all that.

09:23.938 --> 09:28.273
The New Zealand International
Grand Prix introduced a scholarship

09:28.401 --> 09:32.441
to get a New Zealand driver
to compete internationally.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.524
Well, tonight's winner,
he started racing as a 15-year-old.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.451
This year alone he's won six out of six
sports car races,

09:42.582 --> 09:45.700
driving the ex-Jack Brabham
Bobtail Cooper.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.077
The winner is Bruce McLaren.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.624
Now, Bruce,
this award allows you to go to England,

09:53.760 --> 09:57.754
where you will train and race
with the Cooper Car Company.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.348
Bruce was 20 years old.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.893
Mr and Mrs McLaren said,

10:09.025 --> 10:12.268
"Would you go with Bruce
as a mechanic/helper?"

10:12.403 --> 10:14.110
I said, "But I'm not a mechanic."

10:14.239 --> 10:17.858
You know, I worked in an automotive
parts warehouse for my dad.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.279
Bruce said, "You'll learn."

10:36.427 --> 10:38.919
Backing us up was Jack Brabham.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.431
What I was able to do
was to have it teed up for him

10:42.559 --> 10:43.970
to come to the Cooper Team.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.640
This is where we build our racing cars

10:46.771 --> 10:50.981
and there are hundreds of component
parts that go to building a racing car.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.192
John Cooper said,
"There's your car over there."

10:53.319 --> 10:55.686
And he looked over,
and it was a pile of pipes and a rack.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.361
That's your car there, boy.
Now you better start building it.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.405
And he had to set about
with Colin Beanland to build the car

11:02.537 --> 11:03.869
before he could race it.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.205
And Bruce started his Formula 2 career.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.125
Dear Dad, I wish you could be over here

11:10.253 --> 11:12.290
doing this motor racing with me.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.664
I reckon I've inherited
something from you.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.384
It's the ability to have a go
when the time is right.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.754
Bruce started getting
some good placements in races,

11:21.890 --> 11:25.304
which helped the budget.
And he liked the money that he won.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.730
Bruce was an incredibly prolific
letter writer.

11:31.858 --> 11:36.193
And the boys would record tapes
to send back home.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.365
Thanks, Pop, by the way,
for that extra cash you sent over.

11:41.492 --> 11:45.361
Fortunately, I don't think I'll need it.
The way I'm looking at this season

11:45.496 --> 11:49.080
is to get in as many races this year
as possible, and do well.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.701
I'm looking forward to Nürburgring
very much.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.544
It's a very tough course,
and if I can finish there,

11:54.672 --> 11:56.664
I'll be very happy.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.721
It was a combined Formula 1 and 2 race.
Bruce in Formula 2.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.682
The Nürburgring was the most
dangerous circuit on the calendar.

12:10.813 --> 12:15.399
They called it The Green Hell.
Torturous, very, very dangerous...

12:19.405 --> 12:22.239
There were several sections where,
if you were brave enough,

12:22.367 --> 12:25.360
you'd go over the top of a hump
and you were flying.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.667
So many different corners,
so many different type of corners,

12:33.795 --> 12:36.959
you know, up a hill, down a hill,
off camber, with camber,

12:37.090 --> 12:39.332
jump twice, four wheels in the air.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.594
It was a challenge to any driver.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.758
It doesn't matter
how much you knew Nürburgring,

12:45.890 --> 12:49.224
every lap there was a new challenge.

12:51.145 --> 12:55.105
Bruce was sort of unknown at that time.
A new kid.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.147
And he was actually leading
the Formula 2 section.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.696
As the race progressed,

13:02.824 --> 13:05.532
he got into some of the Formula 1 cars,
and passed them too.

13:08.579 --> 13:14.075
He finished fifth overall.
Won the Formula 2 section of it.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.960
As he drove up, back to the pit,

13:17.088 --> 13:21.628
he had a grin on his face
that was obviously like a mile wide.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.797
He was just absolutely elated.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.721
I helped him out of the car and,

13:27.849 --> 13:31.263
you know, I think there were tears
in both our eyes.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.972
That was really the thing
that turned the tide.

13:37.108 --> 13:43.321
It got international recognition.
He became on the contenders' list.

13:44.741 --> 13:50.453
# Happy birthday to you

13:51.122 --> 13:55.708
Bruce turned 21 during that year.
He was still in England,

13:55.835 --> 13:58.999
but there was a great 21st
birthday party at his parents' house.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.838
# Twenty-one today, twenty-one today

14:01.966 --> 14:03.502
Well, hello, son.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.342
I hope you've had a wonderful day,
and as Phil said,

14:06.471 --> 14:09.214
we just hope you don't think
we're all under the influence of liquor.

14:09.807 --> 14:14.017
We both got homesick, but the driving
force behind the whole thing

14:14.145 --> 14:16.933
was the enthusiasm
we had for what we were doing.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.352
- Over to Dad.
- Hello, Bruce.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.227
Once again,
very many happy returns of the day.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.979
I mean, people would
love to have done what we did.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.946
The Auckland Car Club used
to hold regular club nights.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.953
Pop would take the tape recordings.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.501
At Goodwood,

14:39.629 --> 14:42.417
the biggest sort-out
between the professional drivers

14:42.548 --> 14:45.632
and the chaps just starting
is the fast corners.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.425
On these fast corners,
you go round them the first few times,

14:50.556 --> 14:52.639
you think,
"Ooh dear, that was near the limit,"

14:52.767 --> 14:57.603
but in actual fact it's not. It's only
time and confidence that enables you

14:57.730 --> 14:59.687
to get round the fast corners quick.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.691
The rain was starting to pour,

15:02.819 --> 15:05.607
and the whole banking
was absolutely treacherous.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.152
We were taking this banking
at about 140 mile an hour.

15:09.283 --> 15:13.493
Under the extreme G loading, you have
to hang on to the wheel fairly tight

15:13.621 --> 15:16.830
to stop your hands being pulled down
on to the floor of the car.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.416
I think it frightens everybody.

15:25.049 --> 15:29.134
1959 was Bruce's first
full season in Formula 1.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.506
Towards the end of the year
Coopers were major contenders

15:34.642 --> 15:36.554
for the World Championship.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.437
It certainly looks as though
the last Grand Prix of the season,

15:44.569 --> 15:46.435
at Sebring, could be the deciding race.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.489
Jack had a very narrow lead
over Stirling Moss.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.792
Brabham has got the race in his hands.

16:06.924 --> 16:10.292
Supported by teammate McLaren,
nobody can touch him now.

16:10.428 --> 16:15.093
The race and the World Championship
are his, but now the order has changed.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.841
It's McLaren, number nine,
who takes the checkered flag.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.552
Bruce won.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.394
And team manager John Cooper
welcomes his winner home.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.319
My best friend had now won
his first Grand Prix.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.867
Bruce was now the youngest driver ever,

16:35.995 --> 16:39.159
at just over 22 years of age,
to win a Grand Prix.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.534
And Jack had won the World Championship.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.834
What are they going to say in Australia
when they hear this? Or New Zealand?

16:47.965 --> 16:51.629
I don't know about Australia, but I
think they'll be pleased in New Zealand.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.845
It was a new world for Bruce
because now he's recognized.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.934
I remember Bruce saying,
"I think we're becoming famous."

17:08.944 --> 17:11.278
It was an understatement when you consider

17:11.405 --> 17:13.396
what went on for the rest of the year.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.788
Bruce won the opening round of the 1960
World Championship in Argentina.

17:24.919 --> 17:29.880
And on the plane ride back to England,
Jack, Bruce and John Cooper

17:30.007 --> 17:33.216
came up with a car
that went on to sweep all before it.

17:33.928 --> 17:39.014
Cooper cars have swept the board
and won the constructors' prize.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.597
And Bruce, in his second year with Cooper,

17:42.728 --> 17:45.516
finished second to Jack
in the World Championship.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.898
Bruce McLaren was the first New Zealander

17:53.030 --> 17:56.944
to really get into Formula 1
and establish the fact that a Kiwi

17:57.076 --> 18:02.242
could go and do it, and actually make
that breakthrough on the world stage.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.876
He was an important figure to all Kiwis.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.428
Bruce came back home
every year for the race season.

18:29.442 --> 18:34.187
One of Bruce's heartfelt ambitions was
to win the Grand Prix in his hometown.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.279
For many years motor racing has been

18:36.407 --> 18:37.864
a popular sport in New Zealand,

18:37.992 --> 18:39.949
attracting drivers
with a taste for thrills,

18:40.077 --> 18:42.364
and mechanics with a taste for tinkering.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.158
There are car clubs all over the country,

18:44.290 --> 18:45.826
and though prize money is not large,

18:45.958 --> 18:49.122
there's nothing small about
the amount spent on vehicles.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.295
For the big money,
and the big names in motor racing,

18:52.423 --> 18:55.257
we fly north to Auckland,
our largest city.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.923
Here in January each year is run the
New Zealand International Grand Prix.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.843
In the summertime, there was
a lot of things to attract

19:01.974 --> 19:05.263
Northern Hemisphere drivers
down to New Zealand.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.228
There was not much happening
in the northern winter in those days.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.144
New Zealand was a perfect place
to come and take up some sunshine,

19:11.275 --> 19:13.107
waterskiing, girls.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.817
Enjoying the summer weather
with friends are Grand Prix drivers,

19:16.947 --> 19:19.940
some of whom have come halfway round
the world for the big race.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.568
An expert water-skier,

19:22.703 --> 19:25.616
Arnold Glass is trying to explain
the sport to the English drivers.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.661
At least one of the Englishmen
has other interests in mind,

19:28.793 --> 19:31.831
and Arnold's only pupil
is New Zealander Bruce McLaren.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.794
After his wobbly efforts,

19:36.926 --> 19:39.919
Bruce decides to stick to car racing.
He says it's safer.

19:42.765 --> 19:45.803
In New Zealand,
Bruce met a girl from Timaru.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.604
I certainly remember
when Bruce first met Patty,

19:50.731 --> 19:52.814
and she'd become Miss Caroline Bay.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.609
We met at a dance, from memory.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.979
And then I tootled home
with my girlfriend,

19:59.115 --> 20:00.822
and Bruce said he wanted to meet me again.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.237
And he was only there
for a couple of days,

20:03.369 --> 20:05.827
and then off he tootled,
and kept in touch.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.914
I was 18.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.580
So I always said
we had a courtship by letter.

20:19.510 --> 20:24.221
Before we got engaged,
we'd seen each other about six times.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.389
I always liked people with brown eyes
and dark hair.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.055
He could have been a few inches taller.

20:38.738 --> 20:42.106
Often we would be invited to Bruce's
for dinner,

20:42.241 --> 20:46.155
sometime in the company of people
that weren't motor racing people.

20:46.287 --> 20:51.328
And the whole conversation would finish
off with pencils and pieces of paper.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.830
Bruce at heart was an engineer.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.548
He would make models out of balsa wood
and stick and strings,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.966
and do torsion tests on the kitchen table.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.009
And he would come in the next morning

21:11.145 --> 21:13.478
and show us what he'd drawn
and what he'd built.

21:17.359 --> 21:21.353
Bruce and Jack talked
about life after Cooper.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.823
Here we had effectively a perfect storm.

21:26.869 --> 21:30.283
The two drivers in the team,
not just fantastic drivers

21:30.414 --> 21:34.579
but both capable of engineering
and designing a winning racing car.

21:46.555 --> 21:50.265
Jack Brabham left the Cooper team
at the end of 1961,

21:50.392 --> 21:52.850
and started construction of his own cars.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.939
The engineer in Bruce must have thought,

21:58.067 --> 22:01.276
"That's something which
I really need to do one day."

22:03.322 --> 22:06.065
- How did you go, Bruce?
- That was pretty good that time, John.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.285
I think a bit too much braking on the
back, but otherwise nearly perfect.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.501
Monte Carlo was just magical.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.749
They used to have the film festival
the week before,

22:23.884 --> 22:26.092
so all the stars would stay over.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.843
It was tremendous.
And we used to travel in convoy

22:30.975 --> 22:34.184
with the various other drivers,
and we'd stop off in some little motel.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.351
But we had great fun, you know,
travelling around together.

22:41.151 --> 22:45.236
In those days, all the drivers
were friends with each other,

22:45.364 --> 22:48.732
but they were very determined competitors.

22:51.328 --> 22:55.368
Bruce was now the number
one driver at Coopers.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.158
There was an awful lot of pressure.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.585
All the leading drivers were there.

23:02.381 --> 23:06.751
Jimmy Clark and Graham Hill.
On the front row of the grid was Bruce.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.549
Five, four, three, two, one. Drive!

23:10.014 --> 23:11.846
Graham Hill. Ooh, look at that.

23:11.974 --> 23:14.307
That was Willy Mairesse with the Ferrari.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.892
This was Monaco.

23:20.399 --> 23:24.313
Any driver that can finish at Monaco
in my book's a hero.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.858
It was a real endurance event.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.401
Two and three-quarter hours,

23:29.533 --> 23:33.447
2,700 gear changes, hard on the brakes,
and hard on the steering.

23:38.876 --> 23:42.460
Bruce was in the lead,
followed by Phil Hill in a Ferrari.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.589
Phil Hill was closing on Bruce,
and chasing him down.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.183
And everybody in the Cooper pit
got terribly nervous.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.857
Up on to the straight for the last time,

24:04.985 --> 24:06.476
and Bruce McLaren

24:06.612 --> 24:12.279
wins the 20th Monte Carlo Grand Prix
by two seconds.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.408
Everybody was absolutely ecstatic,

24:17.539 --> 24:20.247
John Cooper more probably
than anyone else.

24:22.544 --> 24:26.208
As Bruce said to me later, he said,
"Phil Hill may have caught up with me,

24:26.340 --> 24:29.754
but there was no way
he was gonna get past me. No way."

24:39.436 --> 24:42.645
Coopers have been really
brightened up by the Monaco result.

24:42.773 --> 24:46.517
And I don't have to tell you, folks,
Patty had a ball meeting royalty.

24:46.652 --> 24:51.772
Grace and Rainier had a cocktail party.
I was fixated by the emeralds.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.775
The necklace, the earrings,
the bracelet, the ring.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.652
And it was just fabulous.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.782
Bruce McLaren by then
was a jet-set person.

25:02.376 --> 25:07.246
World-renowned, youngest Grand Prix
winner of all time at that time.

25:07.381 --> 25:10.715
Bruce McLaren, Jim Clark,
Innes Ireland, racing aces now...

25:10.843 --> 25:12.630
Bruce was a superstar.

25:14.888 --> 25:18.177
We had great fun, you know,
travelling around together.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.009
Time...

25:21.145 --> 25:23.979
Our life is time,
and heartbeats are seconds.

25:24.106 --> 25:27.725
Whatever we do, our preoccupation
with time is constant.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.520
Speed doesn't exist
for a top racing driver.

25:33.657 --> 25:37.241
Your mind completely synchronizes

25:37.369 --> 25:39.281
with the elements
you're competing against,

25:39.413 --> 25:41.154
and one of those elements is speed.

25:42.332 --> 25:46.292
There's an element of danger
but Bruce was such a careful person.

25:46.628 --> 25:52.249
But sadly, motor racing
has its share of tragedies.

25:59.141 --> 26:03.511
Over the years, Bruce saw
a number of his friends killed.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.640
You're dealing with human beings,

26:07.775 --> 26:11.109
cars that are put together
by human beings, so they can break.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.609
Human beings driving them,
so they can make mistakes.

26:17.326 --> 26:21.161
Drivers know that sort of thing's
on any time they get into a car, really.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.665
It may sound callous,
but if you're going to keep racing,

26:29.797 --> 26:31.379
to think on an accident is bad.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.293
It's best to try and forget
as soon as possible.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.631
Everything is in slow motion,

26:40.766 --> 26:42.382
you've got plenty of time to brake,

26:42.518 --> 26:44.805
you've got plenty of time
to change direction.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.430
Speed only happens
when you're having an accident.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.848
At Nürburgring he had an accident,
a high-speed accident.

27:32.442 --> 27:35.435
Bruce said he only remembers
waking up in hospital.

27:44.246 --> 27:47.910
I'd once promised myself I'd give up
motor racing if I had a major crash.

27:51.420 --> 27:57.917
But I found myself thinking, "Not yet."
And I'd like to start something big.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.339
Run my own outfit.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.805
Bruce was preparing for the future.

28:09.771 --> 28:14.812
Bruce was a great student in that
university which was Coopers.

28:14.943 --> 28:19.688
He had a voracious appetite
for information.

28:21.158 --> 28:28.281
That burning curiosity and intelligence.
He had the ability to think big.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.300
When Jack Brabham left,
it became very obvious

28:44.431 --> 28:47.799
that Coopers didn't want drivers
being involved in design,

28:47.935 --> 28:52.020
or in the drawing of it.
And that's where Bruce's passion lay.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.770
Bruce, as an engineer,

28:56.902 --> 28:59.770
could see that Coopers' best days
were behind them.

29:01.698 --> 29:06.614
This was the start of his plan
to get his own full team together.

29:09.915 --> 29:13.829
Jack said, "It's difficult,
but if you want to do it, go for it."

29:17.798 --> 29:21.291
I think the first thing I did for Bruce,
apart from...

29:21.426 --> 29:25.136
I mean, I painted him several times,
of course, winning races.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.507
But he asked me to design a badge

29:28.642 --> 29:32.511
for the then embryo McLaren Racing Team.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.855
This tatty old ledger
came to light recently.

29:35.983 --> 29:40.819
I've got an entry here: "Designing badge
for Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Limited.

29:40.946 --> 29:45.236
For use on racing cars, transporters,
letterheads, lapel badges.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.733
Thirty-nine pounds."

29:48.161 --> 29:51.279
And he said, "Yeah, can you design
a badge that is relevant

29:51.415 --> 29:53.452
to a New Zealand team?"

29:53.583 --> 29:56.417
He was very proud of his heritage,
and New Zealand.

29:56.545 --> 30:01.506
OK, Kiwi, racing car,
the name of the team, a badge.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.091
Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Team.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.597
Bruce McLaren Motor Racing was
first formed to race in New Zealand.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.190
In the Cooper workshop in England,
Bruce and I had built a car

30:19.318 --> 30:22.652
specially to win the New Zealand
Grand Prix, from the ground up.

30:24.156 --> 30:28.321
The car was, for all intents
and purposes, a McLaren car,

30:28.452 --> 30:32.071
but because he was still contracted to
and driving for Cooper,

30:32.205 --> 30:34.788
then it made sense to call it a Cooper.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.038
But it was really Bruce's deal.

30:39.504 --> 30:43.418
Cooper copied our car, and built
a second car for Timmy Mayer.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.923
Timmy Mayer was a young
American driver, Bruce's teammate,

30:51.058 --> 30:53.471
and to some extent, protégé.

30:55.312 --> 30:58.896
Timmy was a very approachable
young fellow.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.517
He'd done very well in England
in Formula Junior.

31:02.652 --> 31:06.487
With his brother, Teddy,
as his team manager.

31:08.116 --> 31:12.611
It was the New Zealand Grand Prix.
This was what we were here for.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.622
Away goes the field of crack drivers

31:16.750 --> 31:18.912
on their high-speedjourney of 150 miles.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.959
Lap after lap with fingers crossed.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.884
And to win in a car
that Bruce and I had designed

31:36.019 --> 31:40.514
and built ourselves was just tremendous.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.353
Lots of hugs all round,
it was a huge effort.

31:56.957 --> 32:02.498
But, as you learn in motor racing,
the highs and lows were enormous.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.626
In practice at Longford,
the last race of the series,

32:09.761 --> 32:13.630
Timmy talked to Bruce about a hump
in the road just prior to a corner,

32:13.765 --> 32:17.349
because Timmy felt that
he was braking before it,

32:17.477 --> 32:19.434
and could possibly brake after it.

32:19.563 --> 32:24.228
And Bruce said, "Yes, you can brake
after it, but be very, very careful."

32:26.528 --> 32:28.360
Timmy went out and never came back.

32:30.824 --> 32:33.658
The vehicle landed a little
sideways into a tree.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.903
The car was virtually broken in two
behind the cockpit,

32:37.038 --> 32:39.655
and, you know,
it just killed him instantly.

32:41.751 --> 32:45.244
It was really our first tragedy.

32:46.256 --> 32:50.751
This was the first time
that it struck so close to home.

32:52.846 --> 32:57.056
When you speak to somebody minutes before

32:57.184 --> 33:03.101
and they're no longer with you,
it affects you quite deeply.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.191
But there was a race the next day.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.313
And the team turned up...

33:15.410 --> 33:17.151
and we raced the next day.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.699
They'd seriously talked
about Bruce not racing,

33:23.835 --> 33:26.248
but decided that, you know,
we must carry on.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.336
This is our business, this is what we do.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.544
At Timmy's funeral, the eulogy Bruce wrote

33:34.679 --> 33:38.093
really was the mantra
that the team followed from then on.

33:39.100 --> 33:43.686
The news that he'd died instantly
was a terrible shock to all of us.

33:45.482 --> 33:49.271
But who's to say that
he had not seen more, done more,

33:49.402 --> 33:54.522
and learned more in his 26 years
than many people do in a lifetime.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.367
To do something well is so worthwhile

33:58.495 --> 34:02.865
that to die trying to do it better
cannot be foolhardy.

34:05.168 --> 34:09.036
It would be a waste of life
to do nothing with one's ability.

34:09.172 --> 34:14.884
I feel that life is measured
in achievement, not in years alone.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.952
At the end of that Tasman series,
we went back to England,

34:42.080 --> 34:44.538
not quite sure what the future
was going to hold.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.790
Eoin Young called me up and said,

34:50.922 --> 34:52.583
"Bruce is here. He wants to talk to you."

34:52.716 --> 34:54.708
Bruce came on the line and said,

34:54.842 --> 34:58.086
"I'm expanding my team,
would you like to work for me?"

34:58.221 --> 35:00.964
He wanted to hire more Kiwis.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.217
"Yes, please.
Thank you very much. I'll do that."

35:05.854 --> 35:09.063
New Zealand mechanics
were very innovative.

35:09.941 --> 35:13.059
They had learned how to build cars
in our little country,

35:13.194 --> 35:16.107
where it was very difficult to get parts.

35:16.239 --> 35:19.528
And so they could make
completely new components.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.195
You know the old saying,

35:21.328 --> 35:26.744
if you give a Kiwi a length of number
eight fencing wire, he'll make anything.

35:26.875 --> 35:30.164
So he liked that attitude,
'cause that's how he was.

35:31.671 --> 35:35.039
Bruce McLaren now had a team
but didn't have a workshop.

35:35.175 --> 35:38.134
Our tow car had a rusty old trailer.

35:38.261 --> 35:42.301
And Eoin Young was sent out urgently
to try and find us a workshop.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.469
In retrospect, it was terrible.

35:44.601 --> 35:48.390
It was very small but in fact
it suited us perfectly at the time.

35:50.899 --> 35:55.018
What he came up with was the corner
of a large industrial garage

35:55.153 --> 35:58.817
that was used for servicing
earth-moving machinery.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.941
With what was virtually a dirt floor.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.659
It probably had been concrete once,

36:03.787 --> 36:06.621
but with all the bulldozers
moving around, it was broken up.

36:06.748 --> 36:11.118
Bruce McLaren Motor Racing in England
started in a very grotty shed.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.000
Well, that ought to do it.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.268
Money.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.059
It takes an awful lot of money
to run a team.

36:35.610 --> 36:39.103
Mechanics, drivers, transportation.

36:39.239 --> 36:44.701
Bruce was up against Lotus, Maserati
and, of course, Coopers and Ferrari.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.327
There was a payroll to meet every week.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.705
Bruce was asked to drive
big American sports cars,

36:53.837 --> 36:55.669
particularly as a test driver.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.882
Ford used Bruce a lot, because
they appreciated his technical ability.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.969
With his engineering background,
Bruce could drive the car,

37:04.097 --> 37:07.215
and he could tell the engineers
exactly what was happening.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.176
Bruce needed the money from Ford.

37:10.311 --> 37:13.019
There was no money in Formula 1.

37:13.148 --> 37:17.392
The McLaren team really
was being financed doing testing,

37:17.527 --> 37:21.737
and we'd do anything up
to three or four hundred miles a day.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.650
There wasn't a lot of money at the time.

37:25.785 --> 37:29.779
They did a lot of tire testing
for Firestone, which paid good money.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.534
Just wonderful experience.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.208
So I knew Bruce quite well by the time
I started working for him.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.420
These were guys, none of them had hit 30,

37:41.551 --> 37:46.216
and they were full of enthusiasm, full
of innovations, and they were smart.

37:46.848 --> 37:50.216
We all spoke his language,
we all shared his humor,

37:50.351 --> 37:53.094
and we were all totally dedicated to him.

37:53.229 --> 37:57.894
He worked along with us. He didn't
stand there and issue instructions.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.564
He would be there with his
sleeves rolled up.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.988
I think now the cars like the big GT cars,

38:04.115 --> 38:06.528
which we drive at Le Mans,
Nürburgring and so on,

38:06.659 --> 38:09.527
they'll do 200 mile an hour,
and they also accelerate like mad,

38:09.662 --> 38:12.075
spin the wheels, you can't keep
full throttle all the time,

38:12.207 --> 38:13.323
and this is a lot more fun.

38:14.834 --> 38:17.827
Bruce decided sports car racing
might be the way to go

38:17.962 --> 38:20.454
for the fledgling McLaren team.

38:21.674 --> 38:26.009
He'd heard of a car that was for sale
in America, called a Zerex Special.

38:27.555 --> 38:31.595
Teddy Mayer was back in America,
with his life in tatters

38:31.726 --> 38:33.843
because of the death of his brother,
Timmy.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.142
And Bruce said, "How would you like
to try and buy this car for me,

38:37.273 --> 38:38.684
and come to England?"

38:38.817 --> 38:42.185
- We chopped the chassis up.
- Put an Oldsmobile engine into it.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.529
Big stack exhaust pipes
so it looked like something from Mars.

38:45.657 --> 38:49.901
Threw it on a plane, took it
to Canada, and won at Mosport.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.528
Bruce McLaren from Auckland, New Zealand

38:52.664 --> 38:54.075
gets the checkered flag.

39:00.797 --> 39:03.414
We, in Europe, were racing for peanuts,

39:03.550 --> 39:06.167
and for us to go to America
and see the sort of money

39:06.302 --> 39:08.385
that was available was mind-blowing.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.387
With his new team,
Bruce needed management.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.226
What about a mechanical means
of taking the nuts off?

39:16.354 --> 39:19.017
- Like Tyrell's air wrenches.
- Wouldn't be a bad idea.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.356
Teddy Mayer was a lawyer.

39:21.484 --> 39:24.477
He became the business brains
of the operation.

39:27.824 --> 39:31.033
He took one look around
the workshop and said,

39:31.160 --> 39:33.698
"Goddamn, you can't work here."

39:33.830 --> 39:36.914
And so Eoin Young was sent out again.

39:37.041 --> 39:41.877
Eoin Young got us what was
a really upmarket workshop in Feltham.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.669
It was 10,000 feet,
the ideal place to start up.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.759
It had lots of windows,
and a good concrete floor,

39:48.887 --> 39:51.345
and nice work benches, and even an office.

39:52.682 --> 39:55.220
And Bruce decided to start
with a clean sheet of paper,

39:55.351 --> 39:57.718
and we would build the first ever McLaren.

39:57.854 --> 40:00.597
This year we decided that the car
that would probably win

40:00.732 --> 40:04.521
would be a lightweight car powered
by a relatively big American engine.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.987
The McLaren M1.

40:08.448 --> 40:12.408
Bruce basically sketched
with a piece of chalk on the floor

40:12.535 --> 40:14.026
what we were gonna do.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.371
It was instantaneous stuff.
There was no time to draw.

40:17.498 --> 40:20.206
The chap would come in at night and say,
"What have you made today?"

40:20.335 --> 40:22.748
"I've made a couple of wishbones here.
Just draw those."

40:22.879 --> 40:25.212
I had an office with a sign
on the door that said,

40:25.340 --> 40:27.502
"Don't knock.
We don't have that sort of time."

40:27.634 --> 40:30.047
Bruce was famous
for just waving his arms and saying,

40:30.178 --> 40:31.714
"You know, just make it like this."

40:31.846 --> 40:35.556
Whoosh, you'd take some tubes,
and bonk, you've got a chassis.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.801
That was one of Bruce's favorite
terms "Just whoosh bonk."

40:38.937 --> 40:42.146
And of course that stuck, then
everything was "whoosh bonk" after that.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.435
But it was anything but whoosh bonk.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.524
The day we wheeled it out
of the workshop, painted black,

40:49.656 --> 40:52.615
with a silver stripe,
and a little Kiwi badge on it,

40:52.742 --> 40:56.486
was a very, very proud moment
for all us New Zealanders.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.835
Bruce went off to America to run that car.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.582
And you'd kind of pack up
and become gypsies.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.757
You know, you'd find space in somebody's
garage, in some dealership,

41:13.888 --> 41:15.720
whatever, to work out of.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.090
Spare parts that had to come from England.

41:20.311 --> 41:25.022
It was a lightweight car,
very much like a formula car in Europe.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.558
It created a huge amount of attention.

41:29.654 --> 41:34.240
The Americans at the time were running
heavy cars, incredibly heavy.

41:34.367 --> 41:37.451
Bruce was nimble,
and he could duck and dive and weave

41:37.578 --> 41:40.366
amongst all these
great big heavy monsters.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.699
The phone started to ring,
and people started to ask,

41:43.835 --> 41:45.622
"How can we get one of these cars?"

42:07.316 --> 42:09.308
- Boy, that car is something else.
- Yeah.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.730
Would you like to drive her?

42:19.454 --> 42:22.663
- Mister, you got yourself a deal.
- I'm glad you like the car.

42:29.922 --> 42:33.290
Dad, we're pretty pleased
the way things are going.

42:33.426 --> 42:36.794
We could have sold 30 sports cars
this year if they'd been available.

42:36.929 --> 42:40.639
A lot easier than winning races,
let me tell you.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.599
We've got a way to go before we understand

42:42.727 --> 42:44.684
aerodynamics on these sports cars

42:44.812 --> 42:47.304
but I guarantee
we know more than anyone else.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.392
The big excitement has been in Formula 1,

42:52.487 --> 42:55.321
but we're keeping that very quiet.

42:56.657 --> 43:01.368
There at the end
of the runway is Concorde 001,

43:01.496 --> 43:03.988
and in Toulouse let's join Raymond Baxter.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.331
Just seconds to go.

43:08.419 --> 43:14.757
The magic moment with us, the crescendo
of sound from the 593 Olympus.

43:19.222 --> 43:22.215
Nose has come up to 20 degrees,
she's airborne.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.096
She flies.

43:30.566 --> 43:33.775
Bruce said to me, "You know,
we really need a full-time designer,"

43:33.903 --> 43:35.690
because he was flat out all the time.

43:35.822 --> 43:41.568
So I said, "I've got this friend called
Robin Herd who works on the Concorde,

43:41.702 --> 43:43.694
but he'd love to design racing cars."

43:44.372 --> 43:48.537
I'd been three years out of university
and I was working at Farnborough,

43:48.668 --> 43:51.911
which is the headquarter
of the British Aircraft Industry.

43:52.046 --> 43:56.711
When Bruce says to a 25-year-old, "Come
and design my first Formula 1 car,"

43:56.843 --> 43:59.256
you either say, "Yep, I'll do that,"

43:59.387 --> 44:01.629
and risk the biggest cock-up of all time,

44:01.764 --> 44:05.383
or no, you throw away
the opportunity of a lifetime.

44:07.186 --> 44:10.679
Robin was aware of all these materials
we didn't know anything about.

44:11.858 --> 44:16.603
And one of the products
was called mallite.

44:16.737 --> 44:21.732
I did a sort of latest aircraft
technology version of a Formula 1 car,

44:21.868 --> 44:24.155
using honeycomb, double skin and bonding.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.205
Bruce took it with great enthusiasm.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.079
JAN McLAREN: The letters to Dad

44:32.211 --> 44:34.624
were full of technical stuff.
The first mallite car.

44:34.755 --> 44:38.419
There's pictures of the tub, and little
drawings of what he was doing.

44:38.593 --> 44:41.176
Course, Dad just lapped up every word.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.214
It was a very tedious vehicle to build.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.592
We would be working on the car
come midnight.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.266
We would probably be working on the car
all night.

44:52.023 --> 44:55.767
When you've just been working 12
or 14 hours a day, week after week,

44:55.902 --> 44:57.268
there's a bit of tension.

44:59.572 --> 45:02.531
When somebody was welding
and couldn't see,

45:02.658 --> 45:05.696
we would fill a 20-cigarette packet
with oxygen acetylene

45:05.828 --> 45:08.445
mixed at exactly the right ratio.

45:08.623 --> 45:11.115
And you just slid it
until it got to the flame.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.991
And at some point it blows up.

45:14.587 --> 45:17.546
I mean, it scared the pants off of people.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.882
You know, Bruce took all those
things in his stride.

45:22.720 --> 45:28.011
Bruce was always one of us.
Very much one of the boys.

45:29.936 --> 45:33.475
When he built a new car,
he would get into it,

45:33.606 --> 45:36.144
and pretend to drive it,
and make engine noises, and steer it.

45:36.275 --> 45:40.986
"Oh, boy, this is going to be quick,"
and then we'd go, "Yeah, yeah, yes."

45:41.113 --> 45:43.025
Really good fun.

45:45.034 --> 45:48.027
They built a jig
to build a mallite chassis with.

45:48.162 --> 45:53.783
There was a piece of cold-drawn
steel tube, about a four-inch diameter.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.501
And it was realized this would make
a wonderful gun barrel.

45:56.629 --> 46:01.749
We decided we'd make an acetylene,
oxyacetylene cannon.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.375
A cap was welded at the end

46:03.511 --> 46:05.503
and then a little bolt
and a spark plug fitted.

46:05.638 --> 46:07.971
Fortunately I did
a pretty good job at welding it.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.965
Not realizing what we were doing.

46:10.101 --> 46:13.139
Robin Herd was, yeah, an object of fun.

46:13.271 --> 46:15.308
I don't know what we were thinking of.

46:15.439 --> 46:18.398
There was a sense of humor
to everything. They seemed to accept me.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.734
He used to come to work at nine o'clock
or something.

46:20.861 --> 46:23.695
We would have already been at work
for quite some time.

46:23.823 --> 46:26.110
The drawing office door
was at the top of the stairs.

46:26.242 --> 46:29.531
We waited until Robin got in the office.
So this gun was set up.

46:29.704 --> 46:33.493
- Paint cans was a perfect fit.
- Point it towards the door.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.126
And it was far more successful
than we expected.

46:38.254 --> 46:39.745
It went right through the door.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.497
He suddenly had his door flying inside.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.797
We were all organized
to stow the gun instantaneously.

46:45.928 --> 46:49.137
So it was wang, under the bench.
Everything was out of sight.

46:50.349 --> 46:54.184
"What? Bang? Did you hear a bang?"

46:54.312 --> 46:59.182
It was typical of the New Zealand
and by then McLaren sense of humor.

47:00.985 --> 47:04.649
6 a.m., daughter,
eight pounds, brown hair.

47:04.780 --> 47:08.148
Amanda Leigh. Both fine. Father poorly.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.568
We've certainly been very lucky.

47:11.704 --> 47:14.242
Little Amanda Leigh is as perfect
as we could have wished for.

47:14.373 --> 47:18.333
I'm bringing them home
and picking up the nurse on Tuesday.

47:18.461 --> 47:20.999
I don't go to Nassau
until Wednesday afternoon.

47:23.049 --> 47:27.339
He coped with it wonderfully.
I think I had to do more coping.

47:27.470 --> 47:31.384
Well, you have to, if you're
going to have a successful marriage.

47:32.350 --> 47:35.138
And whatever comes along
you take in your stride.

47:36.729 --> 47:40.348
Because he was away a lot of the time.

47:49.075 --> 47:54.446
1966 was Bruce McLaren's first year
as a Formula 1 constructor.

47:57.333 --> 48:00.792
Bruce, above all,
wanted to win in Formula 1.

48:00.920 --> 48:04.254
To the extent that
he got hold of numbers one and two,

48:04.382 --> 48:07.546
the numbers that go on the car,
for Chris and himself.

48:08.928 --> 48:12.512
Chris Amon was going to
be running the backup car.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.427
It never happened.

48:14.558 --> 48:19.644
I never got to do any races at all
because the engine was a disaster.

48:21.816 --> 48:24.934
Bruce put an Indianapolis Ford engine

48:25.069 --> 48:27.402
into the back of his Formula 1 car.

48:28.489 --> 48:33.860
It made a fantastic noise,
but just had no speed at all.

48:40.209 --> 48:42.997
Dear folks,
it's been so long since I've written

48:43.129 --> 48:45.963
I guess you must wonder what's going on.

48:46.090 --> 48:48.878
The last few months
have been a little difficult.

48:49.009 --> 48:52.252
For the first time ever,
we've had a major setback.

48:52.388 --> 48:55.972
The F1 season is over,
and we've certainly had a failure.

48:57.143 --> 49:00.102
It's hard to keep up the spirits
of the team.

49:01.355 --> 49:03.347
The team stuck at it, as they do.

49:03.482 --> 49:06.566
But, you know,
with that engine there was no hope...

49:07.445 --> 49:10.028
which was a real blow.

49:22.418 --> 49:25.035
I've been feeling a bit of pain lately.

49:25.671 --> 49:26.878
Just one question, Bruce.

49:27.006 --> 49:30.170
The doc asked do I get headaches,
and I said, "Yes."

49:30.301 --> 49:32.167
Quite possibly
due to the curve in your spine.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.795
Due to the pelvis not being square
when I stand.

49:35.556 --> 49:38.139
Your left leg
being shorter than your right.

49:38.267 --> 49:42.557
For a more permanent solution, there's a
rather radical procedure that we can do,

49:42.688 --> 49:46.022
in which we replace
the head of your femur with a steel one.

49:46.942 --> 49:48.228
He sent me to have an X-ray,

49:48.360 --> 49:50.898
and when I looked at them,
I was a little shaken.

49:51.030 --> 49:55.570
The right was a beaut ball and socket
and the left was a tatty old thing.

49:55.701 --> 50:01.197
Quite normal Perthes Disease recovery,
he said. But it shook me a bit.

50:01.916 --> 50:04.624
His short leg, and the pain it caused him,

50:04.752 --> 50:06.869
to him personally, was a great problem.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.291
It was never talked about,
it was never, ever considered to be

50:12.426 --> 50:18.013
of anybody else's concern but his,
but it was his reality.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.974
Bruce needed a lift.

50:25.481 --> 50:30.772
This is Le Mans, home of the most
famous road race in the world.

50:31.570 --> 50:33.653
Through his contacts with Ford,

50:33.781 --> 50:36.114
Bruce was contracted to drive at Le Mans.

50:38.661 --> 50:44.623
McLaren had been commissioned by Ford
to build a special version of the GT40.

50:45.960 --> 50:49.670
I first met Bruce about 1966.

50:49.797 --> 50:52.790
We were testing and developing with Ford.

50:54.260 --> 50:56.968
We used to kid around,
because he had a bit of a limp,

50:57.096 --> 51:00.305
and he had to have
the clutch pedal closer to him.

51:00.432 --> 51:05.803
And I said, "You know what?" I said,
"I keep banging my shins on that."

51:05.938 --> 51:09.147
Stupid things, but that's what friends do.

51:11.569 --> 51:15.813
I was in good hands with Bruce.
I wanted to learn as much as I could,

51:15.990 --> 51:17.697
because Bruce was an artist.

51:18.617 --> 51:23.408
I loved the way he would rotate the car,
and there was a finesse to that.

51:23.539 --> 51:29.080
To be able to extract every ounce
of what this machine is capable of,

51:29.753 --> 51:31.369
a machine that...

51:32.673 --> 51:33.709
can hurt you.

51:35.384 --> 51:39.799
He took that GT40 from a vehicle
that was dangerous at 190

51:39.930 --> 51:44.095
to a car that was going 214 or so
mile an hour, hands off.

51:46.103 --> 51:51.599
Bruce had contributed a lot
of his expertise to the program,

51:51.734 --> 51:55.273
and Fords
were pretty dominant at that time.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.318
Le Mans was really the big objective.

52:00.451 --> 52:03.944
Henry Ford had decided he wanted to win
it and it didn't matter what it took.

52:05.664 --> 52:08.702
There wasn't a budget constraint
like we all had in Formula 1.

52:10.502 --> 52:13.995
Bruce and I teamed up as Ford drivers.

52:14.131 --> 52:17.875
I guess it became natural
to put the two Kiwis together.

52:20.679 --> 52:23.262
Having a chance to win Le Mans was huge.

52:27.686 --> 52:30.349
The race always started
at four o'clock in the afternoon,

52:30.481 --> 52:32.973
and finished at four o'clock
the following afternoon.

52:36.236 --> 52:38.649
Bruce started the race,

52:38.781 --> 52:41.740
sprinted across the track,
one leg shorter than the other.

52:52.878 --> 52:58.124
In those days, those cars, you couldn't
drive them flat out for 24 hours.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.626
But Bruce said, you know,
"We've got nothing to lose.

53:01.762 --> 53:04.800
Let's give it everything."
And that's exactly what we did.

53:04.932 --> 53:06.673
We just drove it flat out.

53:07.393 --> 53:11.103
Headlight beams pick out
the advertising signs in high relief,

53:11.230 --> 53:15.099
and the long lonely night of endurance
lies ahead.

53:21.573 --> 53:24.111
As daylight dawned on the Sunday,

53:24.243 --> 53:26.951
the Fords were in a very strong position.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.915
In first place, number two, Ford.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.874
In second place, number one, Ford.

53:34.962 --> 53:37.295
In third place, number five, Ford.

53:38.507 --> 53:41.625
Ford made the decision,
we're first, second and third,

53:41.760 --> 53:43.092
we'll have a dead heat.

53:43.846 --> 53:46.589
When the decision came to slow us down,

53:47.766 --> 53:50.554
I can remember Bruce being really annoyed.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.184
Bruce did the last stint.

53:56.275 --> 54:00.269
I will never know whether Bruce put his
foot down, or Ken Miles backed off,

54:00.404 --> 54:04.148
but Bruce crossed the line
clearly in front.

54:12.124 --> 54:16.084
Suddenly, you know, we're standing up
on the podium with Henry Ford,

54:16.211 --> 54:19.875
and we've won one of
the most famous races that exists.

54:20.007 --> 54:22.340
We've just won Le Mans.

54:29.683 --> 54:31.845
# A few years back Ford savvied a need

54:31.977 --> 54:34.310
# For a bold new breed
of four-wheeled steed

54:34.438 --> 54:36.680
# A car to stand out
from the rest of the gang

54:36.815 --> 54:38.431
# A car born to fame

54:38.567 --> 54:40.900
# The Ford Mustang...

54:41.028 --> 54:44.988
People on the street, they own a Ford,
and Bruce was driving a Ford.

54:45.115 --> 54:48.904
They'd say, McLaren,
that's the guy that won Le Mans.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.278
It impressed so many people.

54:52.247 --> 54:55.866
# Mustang... 66!

54:56.251 --> 54:58.709
It was a huge PR boost.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.627
Bruce's entire racing operation at that time

55:03.759 --> 55:06.172
was really aimed at the Can-Am series.

55:07.179 --> 55:10.217
Can-Am is the Canadian-American
Challenge Cup.

55:10.349 --> 55:13.558
And that series
consisted of unlimited engine,

55:13.685 --> 55:15.051
unlimited almost everything,

55:15.187 --> 55:18.021
so that people could be very innovative
with their cars.

55:18.148 --> 55:21.391
Well, this is Mosport.
And I'm Bruce McLaren.

55:22.152 --> 55:24.439
What do you think was your biggest break?

55:24.571 --> 55:28.281
The creation of the Can-Am
series was very good for us.

55:28.408 --> 55:31.492
Just at the stage where
we were starting to concentrate

55:31.620 --> 55:33.077
on sports car racing,

55:33.205 --> 55:35.743
sports car racing
became a very big thing in the US.

55:35.874 --> 55:41.211
I started as a race queen, if you will,
with flags, and the jumping.

55:41.338 --> 55:44.672
I hear those engines, and I'm, whoa.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.417
I would go around with this camera
all the time,

55:47.553 --> 55:49.385
and I'd do the drivers' parade,

55:49.513 --> 55:53.723
and they'd all wave at me
when they go by. Like a family.

55:54.226 --> 55:57.264
Got to meet Bruce, and became friends.

55:57.396 --> 56:00.605
I loved the way he always said,
"She'll be right, mate."

56:03.735 --> 56:06.944
Bruce had a good team, and he was trying to

56:07.072 --> 56:10.315
raise enough money
so he could spend enough money

56:10.450 --> 56:13.568
to stay on the cutting edge
of racing car development.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.538
McLaren's design mastery
was very much in evidence.

56:16.665 --> 56:19.874
Thirteen of his streamlined models
were in the race.

56:20.002 --> 56:22.415
The McLaren was the class of the field.

56:23.672 --> 56:26.005
I was so envious, wishing so much

56:26.133 --> 56:28.841
that I could just drive
one of those things myself.

56:30.304 --> 56:33.672
McLaren brand, the cars, appealed to me.

56:33.807 --> 56:37.471
It was smooth, and they looked good.
So that inspired me.

56:39.104 --> 56:41.096
Charging up the back straight,

56:41.231 --> 56:44.474
McLaren makes 165 miles an hour look easy.

56:47.154 --> 56:50.864
I met Lothar,
and Lothar raced a Cobra for a while.

56:50.991 --> 56:53.574
But when he saw the McLaren...

56:53.702 --> 56:54.943
I sold my Cobra.

56:56.163 --> 56:57.779
I sold my house.

56:58.957 --> 57:00.448
I bought the McLaren.

57:05.172 --> 57:08.131
Bruce McLaren was very important to me,

57:08.258 --> 57:11.751
and what he started with
the McLaren team was tremendous.

57:11.887 --> 57:14.470
It was a great couple of years of my life.

57:16.183 --> 57:19.597
But I was approached to meet Mr Ferrari.

57:22.064 --> 57:26.479
Bruce was very disappointed
because I think that he was

57:26.610 --> 57:32.106
thinking about stopping racing himself
and just running the team.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.819
Bruce, you're so busy on
the construction and management side,

57:37.955 --> 57:40.322
are you planning to
retire from racing yourself,

57:40.457 --> 57:44.326
and devote seven days a week
to construction and management?

57:44.461 --> 57:45.872
Not just yet.

57:46.004 --> 57:50.089
I imagine that in a couple of years
or so I will do this.

57:50.217 --> 57:54.632
But at this stage it's still necessary
for me to do the driving.

58:12.823 --> 58:15.031
In '67 we spent three months

58:15.158 --> 58:17.571
just building these Can-Am cars
to go to the States.

58:17.703 --> 58:20.662
That's all we did.
We're just mad activity.

58:20.789 --> 58:23.406
We needed to win to earn the prize money

58:23.542 --> 58:25.955
to be able to afford
to do our Formula 1 car.

58:26.086 --> 58:28.453
I don't know how they scraped through
all those years.

58:28.588 --> 58:32.673
I guess Teddy basically put a lot
of money in, in the early days.

58:32.801 --> 58:38.013
The Formula 1 failure hit
Teddy's wallet very bad.

58:38.140 --> 58:42.931
It was one thing for the sponsors
to say, "Yes, we'll stick with you,"

58:43.061 --> 58:46.554
but they had to have a reason
for sticking with us.

58:48.191 --> 58:52.435
The McLaren team has built
a completely new Can-Am car for 1967.

58:52.571 --> 58:54.062
It's the M6A.

58:57.075 --> 59:00.614
Bruce's new teammate, his fellow
New Zealander Denis Hulme.

59:00.746 --> 59:03.659
Where are you finding that extra speed?

59:03.790 --> 59:07.033
I would say largely with our car, on
acceleration coming out of the corners.

59:08.628 --> 59:10.915
You don't expect any trouble in the race?

59:11.048 --> 59:13.415
I always expect trouble,
I just hope we don't have any.

59:18.430 --> 59:20.547
At Mosport the race was gonna start.

59:20.682 --> 59:22.719
Bruce said, "Look, we've got a problem."

59:22.851 --> 59:25.719
New Zealander Bruce McLaren,
who qualified second,

59:25.854 --> 59:26.890
is not on the grid.

59:27.022 --> 59:28.809
Minutes before the cars were lined up,

59:28.940 --> 59:31.307
the McLaren mechanics
discovered a leaky fuel bag,

59:31.485 --> 59:34.978
and are feverishly working
to replace it, but time is running out.

59:37.199 --> 59:39.862
Teammate Denis Hulme
will carry the McLaren banner.

59:41.953 --> 59:44.821
Dan Gurney, in the second row,
will be his major threat.

59:46.666 --> 59:49.704
The field is off for one tour around
the two-and-a-half-mile course,

59:49.836 --> 59:51.327
without McLaren.

59:59.054 --> 01:00:02.468
And then the Americans
saw Bruce do something special.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:05.428
McLaren is off, flat out.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:08.845
To play catch-up
is a tough way to go racing.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.849
McLaren almost a lap behind
as the pack gets the green flag.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:17.232
Bruce McLaren is 55 seconds behind.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.784
Denis Hulme in the number five McLaren
leads Gurney

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.450
into the deceptive
downhill left-hander at Turn Two.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.366
McLaren's out of the esses

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:33.708
and blasts for
the start/finish straight and green.

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:38.674
Hulme and Gurney are setting
a blistering pace.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:44.380
McLaren gamely pours it on,

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.599
cutting the gap between him
and the tail-enders.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.265
McLaren has caught tail-ender Nat Adams,

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.266
and signals Fred Pipin to let him by.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:05.611
McLaren pulls up five places
in just five laps.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.246
McLaren seems to choose any line

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:11.661
in a daring drive
rarely seen in motor racing.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:30.222
Brett Lunger is into the guard rail,
debris all over the tracks.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.936
Gurney and the sensational Bruce McLaren

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.350
battle for second.

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:40.444
McLaren makes his move
down the pit straight.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.315
But Gurney shuts the door.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.872
McLaren now in second.

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.997
McLaren crew chief
Tyler Alexander looks happy,

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.418
wouldn't you say?

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:04.169
Hulme is in trouble. He's done
serious damage to the bodywork.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.548
McLaren narrows the gap.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:14.679
Hulme struggles on,
the burnt-out wheel locked in place.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.978
Incredibly, Denny holds on to win.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:26.483
Bruce storms back to make it
a sensational McLaren one-two.

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:30.365
Every racing driver likes
the opportunity now and then

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.490
to be able to come
right from the back of the field.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:37.001
Even though Bruce was really
wanting to try and wind down,

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:40.621
he loved racing, he loved driving.
And he was still good at it.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:45.801
Bruce needed another driver in Formula 1.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:50.013
Quite clearly
Bruce and Denny got on very well.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.511
They were Kiwis taking on the world.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.980
Denny had a foot
in both camps, as it were.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.824
He was driving with Jack Brabham
in Formula 1.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:17.287
The Formula 1 season ends up with
Denny becoming World Champion.

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:23.498
Bruce won the Can-Am championship,
Denny was second.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.714
And the longer we went,
we got stronger together,

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.552
and Bruce decided
there'd be a place for me

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.759
in his Formula 1 team,
his new Formula 1 team.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.724
- It's beautiful.
- I don't like the steepness.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.059
- I do.
- I'm with you.

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:37.303
You've got to play up
to the fans, don't you?

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:44.319
Our Formula 1 car was designed. The M7.
Robin Herd designed the chassis.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.398
The car was a success
right from the start.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:57.448
We were starting to look very good.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:02.204
And then, in 1968,
Bruce made history at Spa.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:17.302
Spa is a very, very long race,
very high speed.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:20.896
Fuel consumption is absolutely critical.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.314
Spa was a bit like Monaco.

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.779
Sometimes only three or four cars
would finish.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:32.275
Denny was very competitive.
Second right from the start.

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:35.073
Bruce was running sixth or seventh,
making his way up the field,

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:39.370
and Denny got into the lead, and then
the next thing there he is, in the pits.

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:43.453
Pit stop. What's wrong?

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.501
Drive shaft's melted off the side
of the gearbox.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.094
But Bruce's car was running
particularly well.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:53.971
Towards the end of the race,

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:58.264
he'd worked himself up into
second place, behind Jackie Stewart.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.478
Tyler was out there
with the pit board to Bruce,

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.972
waving furiously,
telling him to go faster and faster,

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:05.395
'cause there was every chance
he could catch Jackie.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.646
On the last lap, unbeknown to Bruce,

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:13.491
Jackie Stewart's car stopped, out of fuel.

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:17.077
But he didn't see Jackie run out,
and he crossed the line.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:23.121
As far as Bruce was concerned,
he'd finished second,

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.870
and we were trying to say to him,
"You've won. You've won.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.462
You've won the race."

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:41.269
Oh, I just thought it was fantastic.

01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:45.106
Absolutely fantastic. And he deserved it.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.446
Bruce had now won Formula 1
Grand Prix in a car of his own design

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:58.365
and manufacture, bearing his name,

01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:01.955
and it was just a major step forward
for the race team.

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.036
It is so appropriate

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:11.257
that the first ever win
for a McLaren in Formula 1

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.922
was with Bruce McLaren at the wheel.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:18.593
And it was the second time in history
that a driver won a Grand Prix

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:21.513
with his name on the nose of the car.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.895
And it's never happened since.

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:30.109
I'd said to Bruce, you know,
"When we first started over here

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:35.356
eight or nine years ago, and we dreamed
about doing something on our own,

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:39.953
we didn't know how long it would take,
when we could do it, but we've done it."

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:47.702
Here in a cul-de-sac, right under
the flight path of London Airport,

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:50.124
is the home of one of the most successful

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:52.543
areas of British motor racing.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:59.054
David Road was a very basic kind
of English industrial estate.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:08.522
To us at the time, it seemed like
this was very grand, but...

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:12.234
Every 80 seconds we had
a jet land over the top of us,

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.775
and if you're on the telephone,
you just had to stop talking.

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:17.489
You'd have to say, "Excuse me,
you've got to wait for 60 seconds

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.779
whilst the building vibrates."

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.363
Having the factory so close
to the airport suited Bruce fine.

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:24.784
He was constantly in the air.

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.746
He was able to jump off the plane
at the airport, get to David Road,

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:30.957
have a few meetings, and he'd be
back on the plane within minutes.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.043
Bruce and Denny spent a lot of time
in airplanes

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.462
backwards and forwards
across the Atlantic.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:46.765
The drivers, Bruce and Denny's,
involvement was split between

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:51.482
a Can-Am weekend,
and then a Formula 1 weekend in Europe.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.442
They'd fly in on the Thursday

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:58.155
because the jet lag was quite bad
between England and the US.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:01.276
And we'd run Friday, and then
Saturday practice and qualifying,

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:02.993
and then race on Sunday.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:11.002
Team McLaren earned more than
$162,000 in prizes for the series.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.754
Bruce must've been
something of a workaholic.

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:22.011
There was this great need
for him to be busy.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.970
I'm not sure
when he ever found time to sleep.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:32.189
Bruce also did have big plans
to manufacture street cars, road cars.

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:35.151
And I remember the prototype coupe
that he built.

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:39.022
We were in England, setting up
to get delivery of our next McLaren.

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:42.616
When we were in the office,
he showed us this model that was there,

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:46.033
the GT that he wanted to build,
because that was his dream.

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:50.082
We would like to do a road car
in the future,

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:52.872
and we're talking and thinking about it.
Some way down the line.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.252
I hope it happens.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:59.796
That road car really was Bruce's baby.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.269
All the neighbors came out

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:19.361
when he very quietly tried to drive it
out of the garage.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.774
I only drove it briefly,

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.743
and wanted to show off
when you had a cocktail party.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:49.888
We're in a tremendously competitive year.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.352
The cars are very, very equal.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:56.770
They're all within tenths of a second
on lap time.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.938
This really keeps you working.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:06.821
Cars were becoming
increasingly more powerful,

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:11.539
and designers were trying to find ways
of creating downforce

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:16.411
to keep the cars on the track,
on fast corners in particular.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.754
And cars started sprouting wings.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:24.217
Aerofoil section. Put it on struts,
stick it on the back of the car,

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.211
put something on the front
to balance it out,

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:28.805
and it gives more downforce,
and therefore more grip.

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:33.470
You know, aerodynamics has come
a long way since those days

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:35.971
of us putting a wing on a minivan

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:38.565
and measuring the downforce
with bathroom scales.

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:47.567
For the '69 season
the car was designated M8B.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:51.116
This was the car that we ran
a high wing configuration,

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:56.333
with struts down on to the uprights,
that proved to be unbeatable.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:00.459
Group 7, the fastest
racing cars in the world.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:05.381
Champions McLaren and Hulme drive these
cars to win on Gulf Premium No-nox.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.136
If McLaren and Hulme depend on it

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:14.931
for power, performance
and mileage, shouldn't you?

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:21.685
The success of Bruce McLaren and
Denny Hulme in Can-Am was extraordinary.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.794
In 1969, there were 11 rounds
of the Can-Am championship.

01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:43.046
McLarens won all 11 of them.

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:48.336
Every race.
Hulme won five, McLaren won six.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:53.265
Just unbelievable.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:11.237
He was bringing home buckets of cash.

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:14.361
Lots of other race team owners
made themselves rich

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.661
and beggared their teams,
and Bruce had it the right way round.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.954
Put your money and your effort
into your race team,

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:23.295
and then, when it's really winning,
then you can live off the highlife.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.838
So we've finished building
the house in Walton-on-Thames.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:36.012
Three-quarters of an acre.
Mum, you'll love it, I'm sure.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.394
I'm happy. It's a real family home.

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:42.848
We've called it Muriwai.

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:56.445
When you talk to anybody
that's at their height,

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:59.745
it has to be all-consuming,
it has to be your total life.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.869
It was like working in a circus.

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:05.917
The circus would go to America,
or the circus would go to Mexico,

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.756
or South Africa,
and you would turn up at the racetrack,

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:11.127
it'd be the same tire people,
and the same fuel people,

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.345
and all the other same team members,

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.555
and you hadn't seen each other
for three weeks.

01:13:17.268 --> 01:13:20.352
It was just like a small community
that moved around the world.

01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:24.640
New Zealander Bruce McLaren
driving in his 100th Grand Prix

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.937
at the age of only 32.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:31.860
Each year it gets a little harder
to keep everything as neatly

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:35.780
and as nicely controlled as we did,
you know, in previous years,

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.655
because there is
just that much more administration,

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:40.576
there is that much more to go wrong.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:44.167
We had grown very quickly
in the space of two or three years.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:50.959
Bruce was so busy that I would, sort of,
wave to him as he passed in the factory.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.756
It was always a rush to get
the Formula 1 cars

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:58.178
built for the January, February start.
And then Can-Am didn't start till June.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.593
Resources were fairly stretched.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:03.937
Not a huge team of people at all,
maybe 50 guys

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:09.481
working on Can-Am, Formula 1
and Indianapolis cars as well.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:13.276
People say the three big races
in motorsport are

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:18.823
the Monaco Grand Prix, Le Mans,
and the Indianapolis 500.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:23.199
The Indy 500 is arguably
the best-known race in the world.

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:31.666
I suppose it was logical for a workaholic
to look at Indianapolis

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.134
as the next thing to tackle.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.170
Yeah, he was building an empire.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.807
Dear folks, two Indy cars
went off last night.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.767
And Denny, Chris Amon, Teddy and I

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:45.137
should be running at Indianapolis
on Monday morning.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.523
Nobody in the team, other than Denny,

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:50.643
really had any experience of the place.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.819
Very early on in the month,

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:56.190
Denny's car caught fire
going down the back straight.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:01.703
Denny's overalls were on fire,

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:04.869
but because it was methanol,
you couldn't see any flame burning.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:09.996
And Denny ended up getting
his hands badly burnt,

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:13.624
which put a stop to his driving,
in fact he ended up in hospital.

01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:24.843
We were scheduled for a test
with the Can-Am car.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:30.898
The entire month of May had been

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.895
a massive intersection
of all of our projects.

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:43.780
Formula 1, Indianapolis and Can-Am
was almost too much for one man.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:46.076
And I think he'd come to the realization

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.167
that he was gonna need to step away
from some driving.

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:53.039
And I suppose perhaps Patty
had an influence on that as well,

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:54.415
understandably.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:16:00.178
He'd just arrived back
from America the day before,

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:01.672
from Indianapolis.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:04.470
Denny should have been testing the car,

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:07.845
because of Bruce just being back
and jet-Iagged.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.390
But Denny couldn't drive.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.064
The design side of the car
hadn't changed a lot.

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:19.315
How are you gonna do a lot better
than 11 out of 11 wins anyway?

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:24.320
The main change came about
through banning high wings.

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:27.698
There were so many accidents
in Formula 1 with the high wings...

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:34.956
that the Americans followed suit
and banned them at the end of the year.

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:38.129
Cary Taylor and myself were at Goodwood.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.470
And they were exploring
rear-wing configurations.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:46.592
They had a wing section hung between
fins on the tail the first time,

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:50.061
and this generated
huge amounts of downforce.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:01.861
We were testing there with
a Formula 1 car, and a Can-Am car.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:04.029
And he was climbing from one car
into the other.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:14.786
He was in a great frame of mind,
and I always remember,

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:19.633
he'd been to see the Sundance Kid film,
and it took his fancy.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.210
He was pretty impressed with that.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:23.382
Ready?

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:27.174
No, we'll jump.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:37.059
Oh, shit!

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:45.109
And you always stop at midday
at Goodwood for lunch.

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:51.123
The Aero Club insists.
But Bruce wanted to do one more run.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.788
And he wanted to use some more rear wing.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:02.630
There was a bit of a frantic
"get the car out"

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:07.131
to get just another lap in
to evaluate this particular adjustment.

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:23.775
You can hear those cars,

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:28.824
the V8 running about 6,000 revs,
and those were monstrous engines.

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:42.757
All of a sudden, it's just...

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.348
And a silence.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:19:00.020
Jim Stone and I jumped in my car,
and then drove round.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:05.989
And I lifted him out of the car, and
it was obvious to me that he was dead,

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:08.824
because he was broken,
and he was like a rag doll.

01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:13.744
And so I... I held on to him.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:18.710
I sat there and held him
until the ambulance came,

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:21.045
and then the ambulance people
took him off me.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.087
It wasn't too long
before I had a phone call,

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:33.968
and it was a tragic accident,
and we had lost Bruce.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.228
So... so...

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:41.938
being what we were, we took
the broken car, put it in the truck,

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:45.608
and I drove the truck back to the factory.

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:49.073
I had to tell Patty what had happened.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:55.823
A couple of the people from
McLarens just came to the house.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.416
I think one is in a state of shock
for such a long time.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:01.787
Amanda obviously was little,
so she wasn't totally aware of it.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:06.424
I said to Denny, "Let's just go outside."

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:09.670
So we went outside
and walked around the lawn

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.637
and the garden in Bruce's house.

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:17.770
I realized I would have to call
Bruce's parents in New Zealand.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:22.649
And it was now after midnight there.

01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:29.239
Pop answered the phone
and it was just so difficult...

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.158
to tell them what had happened.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:38.244
I spoke to Pop. I spoke to Mrs Mac,

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:44.121
and Mrs Mac said, "You know, I had
a dreadful premonition this morning

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.543
that something was going to happen."

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:51.420
And I sat up suddenly in bed.

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:56.346
Just bolt upright.
And Les says, "What's the matter?"

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:00.391
That whole day's come back, Roger.

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:04.770
It's...

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:10.693
You build a pretty close relationship
with a driver. He's got to trust you.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:12.986
And...

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:17.824
Yeah.

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:21.540
Yeah, a very sad day.

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:32.845
I wanted the boys to carry on,
and I wrote a letter to the team,

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:35.463
the boys as I always called them.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.391
My boys.

01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:53.110
What happened should never have.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:59.409
At, say, 180 mile an hour, with the
rear wing set at a fairly high angle,

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:02.123
the rear section of the car lifted.

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:11.337
Unfortunately, there was
a marshal's post, due for demolition,

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:15.929
hadn't been demolished,
right in the path of the car.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:24.013
Teddy and I decided we would get
everybody in the factory together,

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:28.017
and we said to them, "Take tomorrow off."

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:31.520
The next day everyone turned up.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:35.023
Yeah, we decided to carry on. I mean,
that's what he would've wanted us to do.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:44.408
Eoin Young, Patty McLaren
and myself would fly out to New Zealand

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:45.784
for his funeral.

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:53.834
The funeral procession
left to drive to the cemetery.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.591
At every intersection,
there was a traffic officer

01:22:57.723 --> 01:23:00.466
making sure the lights were overridden,

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:04.595
so that the cortège
was never going to be slowed down.

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:07.564
All of the traffic officers
stood to attention

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:10.729
and saluted as we went through.

01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:22.616
We got a huge photograph of Bruce,

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:27.459
and we put it up on the far wall
of the factory, in the prototype shop.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.294
Denny was there virtually every day,

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:33.881
other than the days that he had to go
and see the specialist,

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:39.129
and he took over the mantle
of team leader.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.551
At the back of everyone's mind, of course,

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:47.520
was here we are due to be on Mosport,
first Can-Am race, June 14th.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:49.014
Within two weeks.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:52.358
And so another car had to be built
very quickly

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:55.479
if we were
a functioning motor racing team.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:59.358
They quickly designed
a whole new system of struts

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.406
to hold the bodywork and the rear wing.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:05.747
Denny said,
"I'm going to drive at Mosport,"

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:08.241
because he said
we've got to be there with two cars.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:10.744
And we said, "No, you're not. You can't."

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:14.088
"The doctors have all said to you that,
you know, your hands are so bad."

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:17.175
Denny certainly made it very obvious that,

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:19.168
come what may, he was driving.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:26.226
The immediate thought was who can
we approach to drive the second car?

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.937
The McLaren team is here,

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:32.182
dedicated to winning
in the memory of their boss.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:34.559
Dan Gurney, a close friend of Bruce's,

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:36.812
has volunteered to drive
the second McLaren.

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:39.109
I drove a Can-Am car for McLaren

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:43.781
under the worst sort of circumstances,
when Bruce left us.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:49.783
I felt as though my old friend would
probably be honored if I could do well,

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.410
and so I said yes.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:55.584
He joins Denny Hulme,
whose hands have been badly burned

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:58.959
in testing for the Indy 500.
Against doctors' orders,

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.837
and with his hands heavily bandaged,
Denny will race.

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:05.635
So on the grid at Mosport,

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:09.431
there's Denny with extremely painful,
burnt hands,

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:13.807
and then that left hand
went onto the wheel,

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:20.064
and we had to sort of mould it
round the wheel so he could hold on.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:25.410
Unbelievably the doctors
at Mosport allowed him to start.

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:34.498
Denny led for most of the way,
until he had gearbox problems.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.871
Dan won the race.

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:40.504
Denny finished third.

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:44.470
It was a great opportunity
to do something for Bruce

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.180
to keep things going.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:50.351
McLaren went from success to success.

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:53.597
Teddy won the Can-Am Championship in 1970.

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:59.027
We'd won the Indy 500 in the new M16
with Mark Donohue.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:02.522
In 1974, we achieved our ultimate goal,

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:05.901
we won the Formula 1 World Championship
with Emerson Fittipaldi.

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:11.619
We won the Indy 500 with the works car
with Johnny Rutherford.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:15.915
Repeated that in 1976
with James Hunt in Formula 1,

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:19.331
Johnny Rutherford again at the Indy 500.

01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:22.755
And McLaren became
the only team in history

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:27.631
to have completed the World Championship
Indy 500 double for two years.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:33.477
The legacy of Bruce McLaren lives on.

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:49.323
I've always said that if Bruce had come
into the factory one morning and said,

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:52.913
"OK, men," because he always
addressed us collectively as men,

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:56.284
"OK, men, we're not gonna work
on racing cars today,

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.377
we're gonna march across
the Sahara Desert,"

01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:02.169
we'd have all said,
"OK, Bruce. You know, no problem."

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:08.505
I remember my first actual race.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:13.635
It was on a beach at a place called
Muriwai, in New Zealand.

01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:16.937
And I was about 16.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:24.145
It was probably the shortest,
slowest race I'd ever win.

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:26.193
Certainly there was no prize money.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:29.362
In fact, I might have got a certificate,
which says,

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:31.611
"This hereby declares that B. McLaren

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:35.866
won a up to 1500cc all-comers
handicap race."

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:38.618
But I was certainly excited by it.

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:03.897
They tell me that there have
been quite a few modifications

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:05.861
carried out on this car of yours.

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:08.151
What would some of those modifications be?

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:10.616
I believe, for a start,
you're using a bamboo space frame.

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.827
That's correct. It's a bamboo space frame.

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:16.743
And we're also using,
the most sensational development

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.207
is of course the square wheel.

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:21.453
That gives us more tread area
when the car is going sideways.

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:24.956
That's tread area on the ground,
as you must of course understand.
