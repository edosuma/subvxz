<i>Black Lightning...</i>

00:02.100 --> 00:03.600
I'm gonna make him pay, Khalil.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.310
I'm gonna put Tobias Whale
in the ground.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.430
Dad, I'm ready
to take down Tobias.

00:07.510 --> 00:09.140
Give me a suit if I need one.
I don't care.

00:09.220 --> 00:12.310
Revenge is not
the right thing, justice is.

00:12.390 --> 00:14.610
For a guy like Tobias,
revenge is justice.

00:14.690 --> 00:19.320
But I also know that our powers
supercharge our emotions, and vice versa.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.660
<i> I've been thinking a lot about us.</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.380
And I want you
to meet my family.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.660
- Hey. Your eyes, they change color?
- Huh? What?

00:27.740 --> 00:28.870
I have to go.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.040
Did I say something wrong?
Grace!

00:31.120 --> 00:34.670
The Markovians are in Freeland,
and they tried to kidnap Dr. Stewart.

00:34.750 --> 00:39.680
We can protect you.
If you can safely move the pod kids.

00:39.750 --> 00:44.100
You'll need us both to keep the pod
kids alive if you want them moved.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.610
<i>Access to project MOD granted.</i>

00:47.690 --> 00:49.690
These are the pod kids.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.190
It's where they were giving the original
vaccinations to the kids of Freeland.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.320
That's Dr. Helga Jace.

00:55.390 --> 00:58.370
I bet if anyone knows where those four
metas at the clinic are, it's her.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.180
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

01:01.180 --> 01:03.490
Before they were meta-humans,
these were convicted murderers.

01:03.570 --> 01:04.910
Homicidal psychopaths.

01:04.989 --> 01:07.040
How soon before you get
these cans open?

01:07.110 --> 01:08.540
I have no idea
what to do with it.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.790
I know who does.
Abort the order to cancel Dr. Jace.

01:11.870 --> 01:14.390
We're gonna have to make her
a more permanent guest.

Hey, baby girl, don't worry.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.070
If things get out of
control, I'm right here.

01:40.150 --> 01:41.910
All right, Jen, give me 50%.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.450
Wow. She's barely
breaking a sweat,

01:48.530 --> 01:50.950
she's already kicking out more
energy than you did in your prime.

01:51.030 --> 01:54.920
In my prime? What are you saying?
You calling me old?

01:54.930 --> 01:57.290
Not old, Jeff, just less young.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.310
All right, Jen,
you can power down.

02:12.860 --> 02:13.940
My bad.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.270
Can I please
stop being Jen-in-a-box?

02:18.350 --> 02:20.820
Honey, just a second.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.950
I thought overloading the
sanctum was virtually impossible.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.660
It is. The sanctum's power
grid is built to withstand

02:26.730 --> 02:30.410
the electromagnetic pulse
from a nuclear explosion.

02:30.490 --> 02:34.620
So my hot-headed 16-year-old
daughter is a walking nuclear bomb?

02:34.630 --> 02:40.260
Not nuclear, Jeff, but like Perenna said,
she is powerful. Extremely powerful.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.970
After all she's been through...

02:45.040 --> 02:49.010
I'm not sure she's stable enough
to keep her abilities in check.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.020
Dad?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.090
Yeah?

02:54.170 --> 02:55.990
You know Anissa taught me
how to read lips, right?

02:58.720 --> 03:02.230
So thanks for your vote of confidence.
I appreciate it.

Dr. Stewart.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.680
Agent Odell, I don't like this habit
you have of dropping by unannounced.

03:29.690 --> 03:31.770
And where's
your sociopathic sidekick?

03:32.690 --> 03:35.730
Dr. Stewart...

03:35.800 --> 03:42.610
I understand you're hesitant to help us
move the pod children to another location.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.860
But I wanna help
with your decision.

03:44.870 --> 03:48.530
I'm prepared to offer your
lab here at Bowman College

03:48.610 --> 03:54.120
a grant of $1,000,000.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.620
Agent Odell, I'm not sure the
people you're used to dealing with,

03:56.630 --> 03:58.320
but I'm not for sale.

03:58.330 --> 04:01.460
If you want my help,
I'm gonna need the truth about everything.

04:01.470 --> 04:04.210
Why you're having me followed,
who tried to kidnap me,

04:04.290 --> 04:06.920
and what happened to Issa.
Everything.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.140
Some things are better
left unknown.

04:10.150 --> 04:13.230
Then good luck moving the pods.
I'll pray for them.

04:21.670 --> 04:26.400
Markovia has been running an unsanctioned
metahuman program for decades.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.910
Their assets
had very small lifespans,

04:29.980 --> 04:34.950
so they stockpiled dozens of
viable metas at their disposal,

04:35.030 --> 04:37.750
and put them in stasis
for safekeeping.

04:37.820 --> 04:41.130
Why would the Markovians
come to Freeland? Why now?

04:41.210 --> 04:42.340
Because of you,
Dr. Stewart.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.000
Me?

04:46.020 --> 04:50.970
The Proctor Green Light mess
made world news,

04:51.040 --> 04:52.730
and you are front and center.

04:52.810 --> 04:57.140
You are close to stabilizing the pod
kids, the Markovians know it.

04:57.220 --> 04:58.600
And if they can obtain you

04:58.680 --> 05:02.770
and force you to do the same
for their metahuman army...

05:02.850 --> 05:05.320
They'd be the most powerful
country in the world.

05:06.950 --> 05:08.940
Why go after Issa?
He's not a scientist.

05:09.020 --> 05:12.660
The Markovians live by
a very simple rule.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.780
Either you are with them
or against them.

05:15.860 --> 05:19.830
Every metahuman in Freeland,
be they in pods,

05:19.910 --> 05:23.680
jumping out of body bags,
stomping holes in the streets,

05:25.390 --> 05:30.430
throwing bolts of lightning,
is in danger and will be acquired,

05:31.800 --> 05:33.190
or terminated.

05:36.090 --> 05:39.180
If so many lives hang in the
balance, I'll help move the pod kids.

05:39.260 --> 05:43.240
But on one condition.
You keep Dr. Jace away from me.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.290
We took some high-res photos
from a drone

06:46.300 --> 06:50.050
and found bolt patterns for four
large, rectangular structures.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.590
Hell, they left a third-of-an-inch
impression on the concrete floor.

06:53.670 --> 06:56.800
First thing that popped into my head
is that maybe these are some of those

06:56.810 --> 07:00.260
pod things Lynn has been working
on at that warehouse across town.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.640
That's why I came to you.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.640
Whatever was here
had to weigh a couple of tons

07:03.650 --> 07:05.600
in order to leave this size
depression on the floor.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.770
I can't say whether
it was pods or not.

07:07.850 --> 07:11.400
If it was, they're made differently
from any pods I've come across.

07:11.410 --> 07:14.240
We also found some weird,
purple residue right here.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.290
What are you doing?

07:25.300 --> 07:27.080
My watch is also
a Geiger counter.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.420
'Course it is.
What else you got?

07:29.490 --> 07:32.350
Poison darts in your pen?
Phone in your shoe?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.010
Whatever was here
was slightly radioactive,

07:38.020 --> 07:42.310
but it didn't possess enough radiation
to be used as a weapon of any kind.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.320
I'm guessing it was more like
a power source.

07:44.940 --> 07:46.530
What does that mean?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.350
I don't know. It raises more
questions than it does answers.

07:49.430 --> 07:53.480
Well, just what I need,
more questions.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.870
So, did Dr. Jace give us a way
to wake up these human popsicles?

07:57.670 --> 07:58.710
She did.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.200
Hmm.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.040
It's the serum that
brings them out of their stasis.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.770
One syringe?

08:05.770 --> 08:08.710
Not enough to bring 'em all out
so she's still of use to me.

08:08.780 --> 08:13.050
The woman is smart, I'll give her that.
What are these watches for?

08:13.060 --> 08:15.130
The prison metas aren't
controlled by the briefcase,

08:15.210 --> 08:17.670
so Dr. Jace came up with another
way to keep them in line.

08:17.750 --> 08:21.390
They have implants in their brain stems.
The watches enable them.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.720
I'll give those evil
child-snatchin' bastards one thing.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.480
They've got great taste
in watches.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.950
So, who do we wake up first?

08:31.150 --> 08:32.240
Let's see.

08:34.390 --> 08:38.789
Let's go with... this one.

08:47.750 --> 08:52.710
Marcus Bishop.
He can control and emit vibrations.

08:52.790 --> 08:56.430
All right, let's wake Marcus'
ass up.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.600
You couldn't have
done that any sooner?

10:22.670 --> 10:24.770
Things just got
a lot more interesting.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.360
Hey.

10:36.430 --> 10:40.190
Hey. I'm sorry, Uncle Gambi.
I hope you don't mind.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.030
Of course not.

10:42.110 --> 10:44.710
There's just something
I had to do research on.

10:45.650 --> 10:46.830
What kind of research?

10:48.110 --> 10:51.050
This is Grace Choi.
She's my, uh...

10:53.040 --> 10:54.380
We're dating, Uncle Gambi.

10:55.450 --> 10:56.920
Okay.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.840
I just thought that
everything was going great,

10:59.910 --> 11:04.430
but after Khalil's funeral,
I stopped by her place, she was gone.

11:06.130 --> 11:09.260
So I found this picture in one
of Grace's bedroom drawers,

11:09.340 --> 11:11.470
and I'm running facial
recognition on the adults.

11:11.550 --> 11:14.190
I was hoping that maybe
if I can track them down,

11:14.260 --> 11:17.950
they can give me some kind of clue
as to why she left in such a hurry.

11:20.140 --> 11:22.990
My gut is telling me
that she's in trouble.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.120
And I just wanna know
that she's okay.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.210
This sounds like it's a lot
deeper than just dating.

11:35.830 --> 11:40.430
Old folks always say, "You never
know what you have until it's gone."

11:41.330 --> 11:42.310
It's true.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.300
I found this pill on the
floor in Grace's apartment.

11:48.380 --> 11:51.010
- Could you help me analyze it?
- Of course.

11:51.090 --> 11:52.610
I know it's a long shot, but...

11:54.720 --> 11:56.070
maybe there's something.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.870
I'm sure Grace
will turn up soon.

12:00.940 --> 12:03.620
Yeah, I sure hope so,
Uncle Gambi. I really do.

12:05.870 --> 12:06.980
<i> Now...</i>

12:07.060 --> 12:09.660
Does it stink like rotten meat?

12:09.730 --> 12:13.490
Or does it crust and sugar
over like a syrupy sweet?

12:13.570 --> 12:18.290
Or maybe it just sags like a heavy
load, or does it explode?

12:18.370 --> 12:21.640
<i>Dream Deferred</i> by Langston Hughes.
Thank you.

12:25.580 --> 12:28.560
Okay. I will see you all tomorrow.
Tavon, good job.

12:36.430 --> 12:38.980
You know, it's not right
what Lowry's doing.

12:39.060 --> 12:40.270
Garfield is your school.

12:40.350 --> 12:42.650
All he cares about
is making rules

12:42.730 --> 12:45.320
and making himself look better
in front of his bosses,

12:45.390 --> 12:46.990
and that's not right.

12:47.060 --> 12:50.000
I mean, all the students
think so. The teachers, too.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.990
Okay, look, Tavon,

12:53.070 --> 12:56.670
I was the one who wasn't here for
Garfield when it needed me most.

12:58.090 --> 12:59.090
Not Lowry.

13:08.510 --> 13:12.150
You always say that Garfield
is a place for second chances.

13:14.170 --> 13:15.900
Where's your second chance,
Principal Pierce?

13:23.640 --> 13:26.730
If you wanna bask in this <i> Lean
on Me</i> moment a little longer,

13:26.810 --> 13:28.440
I can come back a little later.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.530
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Bad News Napier.

13:31.610 --> 13:35.030
What'd you come to tell me?
Am I losing my house now?

13:35.110 --> 13:38.870
They taking
back my gold medals? What?

13:38.880 --> 13:42.210
Jefferson, I'll admit,
the last few times I've come to see you,

13:42.290 --> 13:45.380
I wasn't exactly delivering
sunshine and rainbows.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.050
But this time is different.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.880
Did you get a chance to see

13:49.960 --> 13:53.720
any of the footage from
the sit-in a few days ago?

13:53.800 --> 13:56.930
I heard they posted it,
but I haven't really looked at it. No.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.730
Well, the video went viral,

13:59.800 --> 14:03.200
and it doesn't exactly
paint Lowry in the best light.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.030
<i>Listen,
take this down right now,</i>

14:07.110 --> 14:09.240
<i>or I'll have you removed,
and it destroyed.</i>

14:09.310 --> 14:12.240
<i>Can anybody here
say that if they were crippled</i>

14:12.320 --> 14:15.070
<i>and had the chance to walk
again, you wouldn't take it?</i>

14:15.150 --> 14:17.910
<i>We're all in pods.
You guys realize that, right?</i>

14:17.990 --> 14:20.120
- <i> Yeah!
- Just like the kids on the news.</i>

14:20.200 --> 14:22.960
<i>Trapped by a system that
doesn't give a damn about us,</i>

14:23.030 --> 14:26.170
<i>and run by people like you.</i>

14:26.180 --> 14:27.220
<i>Take her.</i>

14:30.170 --> 14:33.760
The board is getting crucified
in the court of public opinion.

14:33.770 --> 14:39.190
People are chimin' in on social media
saying Lowry isn't fit to be principal.

14:41.360 --> 14:45.230
Okay. What are you
trying to tell me, Napier?

14:45.310 --> 14:47.870
I'm saying the way this thing
is shakin' out,

14:49.690 --> 14:52.290
I think I might be able
to get you your old job back.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.460
We're moving the pods
tomorrow, Dr. Stewart.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.300
Agent Odell, moving them will
undermine the progress we've made.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.010
Besides, I think
I've discovered a way

15:15.090 --> 15:17.890
to jump-start the neurotransmitters
in the pod kids' brains,

15:17.900 --> 15:20.970
speeding up their recovery
and reviving them permanently.

15:20.980 --> 15:23.310
We should at least wait until
I've had a chance to test it.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.810
More time is something we don't have.
Markovians know where we are.

15:26.890 --> 15:30.240
I'm sorry, Dr. Stewart.
We move tomorrow.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.580
You're right.

15:38.660 --> 15:42.080
Our sorry excuse for a father said
we wouldn't amount to nothin',

15:42.150 --> 15:43.760
but look at us now.

15:49.580 --> 15:52.800
Were you talking
to that painting of Tori?

15:52.870 --> 15:57.060
Yes. We were just talkin'
about how far we've come.

15:58.630 --> 16:00.430
She told me to tell you hello.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.440
I think she's actually happy
you're back in my life.

16:06.650 --> 16:09.860
I couldn't sleep,
so I came downstairs.

16:09.930 --> 16:13.490
Did you know great whites
are solitary hunters?

16:17.820 --> 16:23.540
Why did you call me for this job?
I mean, really, you could've hired anyone.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.630
'Cause you're the best
at what you do.

16:27.660 --> 16:28.800
And I trust you.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.300
More than that...

16:35.140 --> 16:36.520
Tori trusted you.

16:39.150 --> 16:41.150
Tell me, why'd you take the job?

16:42.480 --> 16:45.280
Maybe I was tired
of being a solitary hunter.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.000
Damn!

17:04.359 --> 17:06.910
The ASA disconnected the pods
from the main power source.

17:06.990 --> 17:09.579
They would only
do that to move them.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.660
If they do,

17:11.740 --> 17:15.099
there's no guarantee that the briefcase's
connection to the pods won't be broken.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.180
So what's our next play?

17:18.170 --> 17:19.520
We're goin' in.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.270
And we're taking a touch
of Hell with us.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.440
<i>Human rights
organizations continue to protest</i>

17:30.510 --> 17:33.440
<i>human experimentation
in Markovia.</i>

17:33.520 --> 17:35.860
I don't trust Odell
as far as I can throw him,

17:35.870 --> 17:37.860
but after what he said
about the Markovians

17:37.870 --> 17:41.780
and every metahuman in Freeland being
in danger, I had no choice, Jeff.

17:41.860 --> 17:47.080
Well, Anissa and Jen know to lay
low till all this blows over.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.420
If this blows over, Jeff.

17:49.490 --> 17:54.350
We have survived worse things.
We will survive this, too.

17:56.250 --> 17:59.800
Speaking of surviving,

17:59.880 --> 18:04.050
I think I found a way to
stabilize the pod kids for good

18:04.070 --> 18:06.650
using a derivative
of Looker's silver element.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.690
Wait? Is that safe?

18:11.760 --> 18:13.810
I hope so.

18:13.890 --> 18:18.190
It has the ability to supercharge
deteriorating nerve cells in metahumans.

18:18.270 --> 18:20.830
It's a theory
I've yet to test, but...

18:21.900 --> 18:22.870
I'm working on it.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.830
So, how did it go today with
Gambi and Jennifer's suit?

18:28.840 --> 18:35.420
You know, it was, um,
an enlightening experience.

18:35.500 --> 18:42.130
So in other news,
Napier came by my classroom today.

18:42.210 --> 18:43.930
Ugh. God.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.610
- What bad news did he bring today?
- Right?

18:47.680 --> 18:51.600
That man is all about the bad news.
No, but not this time.

18:51.610 --> 18:55.020
See, apparently, uh,
'cause of all the fallout

18:55.100 --> 18:58.280
from the sit-in that your
youngest daughter started...

18:58.360 --> 18:59.860
Mmm!

18:59.940 --> 19:01.700
Lowry's job is in jeopardy.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.530
What?

19:06.610 --> 19:11.410
There is an emergency, closed-door
board meeting tomorrow at Garfield.

19:11.490 --> 19:13.370
They want me to testify
to his character.

19:14.890 --> 19:16.450
If I play my cards right,

19:16.530 --> 19:22.220
Napier thinks that I could
have my job back by morning.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.640
Oh, Jeff! Oh!

19:24.650 --> 19:26.060
That's amazing!

19:28.170 --> 19:30.470
- You deserve this.
- Thank you.

19:30.490 --> 19:33.890
No one looks out for
those kids the way you do.

19:33.970 --> 19:36.900
Let's hope the board
thinks so, too.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.230
Well, I don't see why
they wouldn't.

19:39.310 --> 19:42.700
If you go in there. On second thought...

19:48.740 --> 19:52.460
Mr. Bishop,
so glad you could join us.

19:54.180 --> 19:55.340
Who the hell are you?

19:55.420 --> 19:58.840
My name is Tobias Whale,
and this is Cutter.

19:58.910 --> 20:01.600
Let me be the first to welcome
you into the 21st century.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.090
What do you mean,
"the 21st century"?

20:05.100 --> 20:07.640
I mean your ass has been frozen in
that pod over there like a TV dinner

20:07.710 --> 20:09.310
for the last 25 years.

20:15.640 --> 20:19.780
I knocked you out once already.
Next time, it'll be permanent.

20:20.870 --> 20:22.620
Sit your ass down.

20:31.700 --> 20:35.720
- You ASA?
- Negro, do I look like ASA?

20:35.790 --> 20:38.670
I'm simply a businessman trying to
make you a business proposition.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.290
Nah.

20:40.370 --> 20:43.050
No, you're just like
all the other cats.

20:43.060 --> 20:45.720
You promise the world,
but deliver nothing but pain.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.540
You're half right.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.390
If you don't do what I ask,
there will be pain.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.150
If you complete the task
I give you, well...

20:56.980 --> 20:59.320
You'll be rewarded quite nicely.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.080
I'm not looking
for a puppet, Marcus.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.460
I'm looking for a partner.

21:11.420 --> 21:15.550
So what's it gonna be?
Partners?

21:19.090 --> 21:20.830
When will Dr. Stewart join us?

21:20.910 --> 21:23.840
I have some interesting theories.
I wanna talk to her

21:23.910 --> 21:27.930
about how to tackle the pod kids'
cellular matrix deficiencies.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.760
Dr. Stewart will not be
joining us, Dr. Jace.

21:30.770 --> 21:33.600
She wants you
nowhere near the pod kids.

21:33.670 --> 21:35.850
It was my suggestion
to bring her back in.

21:35.930 --> 21:39.650
This is the thanks I get?
Ungrateful little bitch.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.440
You will remain in ASA custody
at this facility

21:44.450 --> 21:46.610
to keep you safe
from the Markovians.

21:46.690 --> 21:48.700
And also,
since we're moving the pods,

21:48.770 --> 21:53.630
I'm gonna need your expertise
close by just in case.

21:54.610 --> 21:56.290
In case of what?

21:56.300 --> 22:01.260
In case the Markovians
kill or abduct Dr. Stewart.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.380
Thank you for convincing Mom and
Dad to let me crash here a few days.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.390
They've been walking
on eggshells since I got home.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.440
Yeah. They're just worried
about you, Jen. So am I.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.490
How you holding up?

22:21.810 --> 22:25.480
It's just not fair that Tobias
is walking around a free man

22:25.490 --> 22:27.070
while Khalil's in the ground.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.690
I know you're frustrated...

22:28.770 --> 22:31.570
Please. Don't do that.
I already know what you'll say.

22:31.580 --> 22:34.320
You'll side with Dad and say
I need to be responsible.

22:34.340 --> 22:37.120
Hell no!
Look, Tobias has to go.

22:37.200 --> 22:42.000
But what I do agree with Dad
is, is that Tobias is dangerous.

22:42.010 --> 22:45.250
And we can't be running around
half-cocked with no plan.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.470
We cannot take Tobias down
if he kills us first.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.910
Wait, did you just say "we"?

22:51.910 --> 22:53.520
You thought I'd let you
go out there alone?

22:55.550 --> 22:58.270
But listen to me.
For now, we have to lay low.

22:58.340 --> 23:02.610
And you heard Dad, it's mad real for
metas in these streets right now.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.700
Thank you.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.650
Yeah, I got you.

23:10.610 --> 23:11.910
- Always.
- Yeah, I know.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.590
So,
what's the deal with Grace?

23:26.080 --> 23:27.140
You track her down yet?

23:28.370 --> 23:29.890
Nah, not yet.

23:32.580 --> 23:36.730
Seriously, I'm really worried
about her, Jen. I am.

23:42.310 --> 23:43.770
What?

23:43.850 --> 23:46.810
Mmm-mmm. What's on your mind?

23:46.820 --> 23:52.030
Anissa, look, you know I love
you with everything I've got,

23:52.100 --> 23:55.240
but you're kind of assuming
that Grace is in danger.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.490
Maybe the life you lead
is making you paranoid.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.700
Grace lives a normal life.
What if she's not in any danger?

23:59.780 --> 24:03.330
She's gotta be in danger.
Why else would she just leave like this?

24:03.410 --> 24:08.340
Well, maybe she decided that things
between you two were too serious,

24:08.410 --> 24:09.680
and she dipped.

24:10.910 --> 24:13.850
I'm just saying,
there's a possibility that

24:13.930 --> 24:16.130
maybe Grace just doesn't wanna
be with you anymore.

24:22.610 --> 24:26.520
Oh, Jen, I gotta run
to the sanctum.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.900
Wait. Is everything okay?

24:27.970 --> 24:29.400
Yeah. It's just something
I'm doing research on.

24:29.470 --> 24:31.070
There's food in the fridge

24:31.140 --> 24:34.610
and cash on my dresser if you
wanna get anything to eat.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.540
This shouldn't take long,
and, Jen...

24:38.480 --> 24:39.420
Hey.

24:41.450 --> 24:43.250
Now, don't go nowhere.

24:43.330 --> 24:45.330
Anissa, where would I go?
Where am I going?

24:45.410 --> 24:47.040
- Jen, I mean it.
- Okay.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.750
I'll be here.
Go handle your business.

24:48.830 --> 24:49.890
Sorry.

25:04.990 --> 25:08.060
Excuse me. I'm gonna need
you to prep Wendy Hernandez

25:08.140 --> 25:10.940
for transport to the isolation
wing of the facility.

25:11.020 --> 25:13.230
I'm gonna need
to get Agent Odell's approval.

25:13.310 --> 25:16.070
I have complete autonomy over
the kids in this facility.

25:16.150 --> 25:20.750
So would you please prep her?
I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

25:44.020 --> 25:48.230
Yeah. I heard about you.
Taking down dealers, stealing their bag.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.780
I don't want your money.
I just want answers.

25:54.110 --> 25:55.080
Where's Tobias?

25:55.850 --> 25:56.950
Where's your mama, bitch?

26:01.530 --> 26:04.830
I said, where is Tobias?

26:04.900 --> 26:08.960
I don't know! I don't know!

26:09.030 --> 26:11.630
The only person
I know that might see him...

26:12.950 --> 26:14.890
is the runner
that took over for Painkiller.

26:16.260 --> 26:20.180
Give me a name.
I said give me a name!

26:30.680 --> 26:31.740
Mr. Pierce.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.230
You're about to get
your old job back

26:36.310 --> 26:39.000
until you lose it again for
being negligent, which you will.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.340
You know,
I gotta tell you something.

26:43.420 --> 26:45.740
As much as you think you are,
you're not the right man for this job.

26:45.820 --> 26:48.000
Really? You are,

26:48.080 --> 26:52.420
with your metal detectors and
your zero-tolerance policy?

26:52.430 --> 26:54.670
You enable these kids,
you coddle them. I don't.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.350
I draw a line in the sand.

26:56.420 --> 26:59.300
If people see the line,
they know not to cross it. If they do,

26:59.380 --> 27:00.840
they suffer the consequences.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.510
Do you even care
about what happens to the kids

27:03.520 --> 27:04.970
after they cross your line,

27:04.980 --> 27:07.310
or are they just somebody
else's problem then?

27:07.380 --> 27:10.690
Look, Lowry, Garfield
was built to help those kids

27:10.760 --> 27:13.440
that, historically,
society turns their backs on.

27:13.510 --> 27:17.830
Mr. Pierce,
these kids need consistency.

27:22.020 --> 27:25.620
They need to know someone's gonna be
here for them, day in and day out,

27:25.690 --> 27:27.250
not someone who'll disappear...

27:27.880 --> 27:29.250
I'm done.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.260
- Hey.
- You got the ping?

27:42.340 --> 27:44.810
- I did. What'd you find?
- Anissa...

27:46.380 --> 27:49.230
Technically,
Grace Choi doesn't exist.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.240
What do you mean,
she doesn't exist?

27:53.310 --> 27:56.190
It's a completely
false identity.

27:56.270 --> 27:59.190
Given the quality,
it's one she paid a pretty penny for.

27:59.270 --> 28:02.240
Grace's real name is
Shay Li Wylde.

28:02.310 --> 28:05.250
She was abandoned as a child and she
went from foster home to foster home.

28:05.330 --> 28:11.540
This picture is from one of those homes,
but the adults in it are long dead.

28:11.610 --> 28:15.260
Shay Li was abducted at 16 and
sold to a child prostitution ring.

28:17.170 --> 28:18.260
Oh, my God.

28:19.790 --> 28:23.260
She was inside until the ring
was broken up by ICE.

28:23.270 --> 28:29.480
Then Shay Li vanished until she
resurfaced in Freeland as Grace Choi.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.730
Anissa, there's a lot this woman
didn't tell you about herself.

28:35.810 --> 28:38.020
Are you sure you wanna find her?

28:38.100 --> 28:42.120
There is a lot that I kept from her,
too, Gambi. We all have our secrets.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.120
And yes, I do.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.870
Mr. Pierce, a video
has gone viral which strongly suggests

28:50.950 --> 28:53.040
that Principal Lowry
may not have the temperament

28:53.110 --> 28:55.250
to lead a diverse school
such as Garfield.

28:55.330 --> 28:59.590
As a long-time champion
of Freeland students

28:59.660 --> 29:03.670
and a leading member of this
community, what is your assessment?

29:03.750 --> 29:05.800
<i>You're about
to get your old job back,</i>

29:05.810 --> 29:07.640
<i>until you lose it again
for being negligent.</i>

29:07.650 --> 29:11.560
What could possibly keep Jefferson
Pierce away from Garfield High?

29:11.630 --> 29:13.390
Dad, I'm ready
to take down Tobias.

29:13.470 --> 29:14.990
Give me a suit if I need one.

29:15.060 --> 29:16.390
He's a member of the
Markovian Intelligence Service.

29:16.470 --> 29:18.480
They're especially
ambitious and brutal.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.610
<i> Jeff,</i>
<i>we've been attacked.</i>

29:20.680 --> 29:21.780
Mr. Pierce?

29:25.190 --> 29:29.750
- Are you with us?
- Yes, yes, of course.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.950
I've thought long and hard

29:34.030 --> 29:36.910
about all the possible ways
I could answer this question.

29:36.930 --> 29:41.970
And I feel as though people are
reacting to the video and not the man.

29:43.330 --> 29:45.100
Lowry is different.

29:46.590 --> 29:48.270
He's not very likable,

29:49.600 --> 29:51.510
but he deserves the opportunity

29:51.520 --> 29:55.480
to fully implement his program
before it's evaluated.

29:55.550 --> 29:59.190
Mr. Pierce,
I'm a little confused here.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.950
Don't you want your school back?

30:04.060 --> 30:05.830
Of course I do.

30:07.730 --> 30:11.120
But what the students
need now is stability,

30:11.190 --> 30:18.130
and I believe that Principal
Lowry gives them that.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.860
They said you'd be coming by
looking for me.

30:43.740 --> 30:45.740
Well, here I am.

31:01.330 --> 31:03.510
I got a chance to analyze
that pill you gave me.

31:06.420 --> 31:11.340
It's a custom compound in a mega dose of
a medication used to treat schizophrenia.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.640
Wait.
So Grace is schizophrenic?

31:14.720 --> 31:18.810
It's a definite possibility, which could
explain why she picked up and left town.

31:18.890 --> 31:22.650
<i>Be advised, we have a one thirty-three
at the abandoned Seahorse Motel</i>

31:22.720 --> 31:24.570
<i>between members
of The One Hundred</i>

31:24.640 --> 31:27.450
<i>and a small hooded individual
with lightning-like powers.</i>

31:29.020 --> 31:32.030
Come on, Jen.
What are you doing?

31:58.900 --> 32:00.320
Where is Tobias?

32:01.390 --> 32:03.230
Where is Tobias?

32:03.310 --> 32:05.980
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

32:05.990 --> 32:08.150
Tobias would just kill me
like he killed Painkiller.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.160
I ain't trying
to go out like that.

32:57.530 --> 32:59.120
Get down on the ground!

32:59.190 --> 33:00.410
Get on the ground!

33:00.490 --> 33:01.700
No, you first.

33:17.300 --> 33:19.230
I thought you were about knives.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.860
No one needs to know I was here.

33:29.850 --> 33:31.410
Hey, this way.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.159
No.

34:20.540 --> 34:21.630
No.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.630
Jeff... Jefferson?

34:35.710 --> 34:37.800
Jeff, the facility
is under attack.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.060
I don't know how long...

34:40.420 --> 34:41.940
Jeff? Jeff?

34:49.639 --> 34:50.730
Took you long enough.

34:50.810 --> 34:51.989
How'd you know we were coming?

34:52.929 --> 34:54.730
The ASA are moving the pods.

34:54.810 --> 34:56.489
The briefcase is connected
to the pods.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.830
It's simple deductive reasoning.

34:59.820 --> 35:00.750
You.

35:02.190 --> 35:03.660
You did this to me!

35:03.740 --> 35:04.750
Marcus, no.

35:07.510 --> 35:11.470
It's so nice to see that the
brainstem implants are still working.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.930
If you wouldn't mind?

35:20.590 --> 35:22.440
Now, we have pods to collect.

35:36.230 --> 35:37.650
What the hell was that?

35:37.730 --> 35:39.860
I stuck my neck out for you.

35:39.940 --> 35:42.280
I set this whole thing up so
you could get Garfield back,

35:42.360 --> 35:43.780
and you do what?

35:43.860 --> 35:45.210
You side with Lowry?

35:45.290 --> 35:47.950
Nape, there's so much going
on in my life right now.

35:48.030 --> 35:51.120
Now, sitting up there,
I realized just how much.

35:51.140 --> 35:55.500
The students of Garfield deserve
more than I can give them right now.

35:55.580 --> 35:58.220
Well, know this,
don't expect any more favors.

36:06.220 --> 36:09.570
<i> Jeff, the facility is under attack.
I don't know how long...</i>

36:19.230 --> 36:20.820
Oh, my God.

36:20.900 --> 36:23.420
- Jen, Jen, you're okay. You're okay.
- Jen. Jen.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.750
What happened?

36:25.830 --> 36:28.500
I don't know.
You were passed out when I got there.

36:28.510 --> 36:30.840
I brought you to the sanctum
so you can recover.

36:32.930 --> 36:34.580
Anissa, look, I'm sorry.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.540
I know I shouldn't have
snuck out. Okay?

36:36.620 --> 36:38.600
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
just sit there and do nothing.

36:38.670 --> 36:39.920
Please don't yell at me.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.600
I will yell
at you tomorrow, girl.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.800
Come here.
I'm just happy you okay right now.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.190
Okay.

36:47.010 --> 36:48.370
It's your dad.

36:48.380 --> 36:51.100
Don't tell him.
He's gonna burst a blood vessel.

36:51.180 --> 36:53.560
Jen...

36:53.640 --> 36:57.910
Hey, Dad.
Yeah, I know you're calling because...

36:59.860 --> 37:01.040
The warehouse?

37:01.860 --> 37:03.280
No, I'll bring your suit.

37:03.290 --> 37:04.790
Mom's in trouble. I gotta go.

37:04.870 --> 37:07.000
- Just go. I'll wait here with Jen.
- Wait...

37:10.280 --> 37:11.870
Wendy?

37:11.950 --> 37:14.750
Wendy? You're awake.
How do you feel?

37:14.830 --> 37:16.090
Dr. Stewart.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.800
- Where am I?
- Okay, okay.

37:18.810 --> 37:21.210
I know it's confusing.
I'll tell you all about it,

37:21.230 --> 37:23.090
but right now,
we have to get out of here.

37:23.170 --> 37:24.720
That's it. I got you.

37:24.790 --> 37:26.940
Great. Beautiful.

37:27.010 --> 37:30.390
Wendy, you think you'd be able
to blow through these doors?

37:30.470 --> 37:32.110
- I can try.
- Okay, okay.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.750
- You two okay?
- We're fine.

37:57.830 --> 37:59.420
Did you stop them?
Did you save the kids?

37:59.500 --> 38:00.970
I'm sorry, they, uh...

38:01.710 --> 38:02.680
They got away.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.930
Come on.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.100
You okay?

38:07.930 --> 38:08.900
It's okay.

38:16.530 --> 38:18.270
Whoa!
Gambi, where's Jen?

38:18.350 --> 38:20.360
Perenna took her home
to get some rest.

38:20.430 --> 38:22.620
- You guys got lucky.
- Thank God.

38:27.690 --> 38:31.330
You have a lot of rage
inside you, little girl.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.960
What I fear is that
if you let it fester,

38:34.830 --> 38:36.500
let it go unchecked,

38:36.570 --> 38:39.130
there's a very real
possibility that...

38:42.960 --> 38:44.180
That what?

38:45.710 --> 38:48.190
That you will literally explode.

38:54.990 --> 38:56.940
Did you find any footage?

38:57.010 --> 39:01.480
Everything video-related around that
warehouse went dark for half an hour.

39:02.980 --> 39:05.150
Has to be the Markovians.
Odell said they were coming.

39:05.230 --> 39:06.450
Oh, great.

39:06.530 --> 39:08.490
I found a reference
in my old ASA files

39:08.570 --> 39:12.160
to a metahuman used in guerrilla
warfare over 25 years ago.

39:12.240 --> 39:15.950
He sounded identical to the one that
broke into the facility tonight.

39:16.030 --> 39:17.920
His codename was Shakedown.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.510
He was part of a covert ASA-run program
to turn violent inmates into metas.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.570
There were four of them.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.710
They called themselves
the Masters of Disaster.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.010
Subtle.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.930
When the ASA
scrubbed the operation,

39:29.940 --> 39:34.510
the metas were supposedly
destroyed, but apparently not.

39:34.590 --> 39:37.520
I'm guessing there were pods
in the basement of the clinic,

39:37.590 --> 39:39.690
and Shakedown and his team
were inside of them.

39:44.310 --> 39:46.690
The question is,
where are they now?

39:51.610 --> 39:54.120
How soon before all my metas
are at full strength?

39:54.130 --> 39:57.450
Two weeks to a month if I
let them gestate properly.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.250
Four days if I push it.

39:59.320 --> 40:04.290
But some will die in the process.
I'm good either way.

40:04.300 --> 40:07.420
Since I'll be renting these super
freaks out to the highest bidder,

40:07.500 --> 40:08.720
the more, the merrier.

40:09.830 --> 40:11.890
The more there are,

40:11.960 --> 40:14.890
the merrier
my bank account will be.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.770
I expect to be compensated
as well.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.630
After all,

40:19.710 --> 40:24.160
you're about to be the most powerful
metahuman arms dealer in the world.

40:30.310 --> 40:31.750
I didn't hear you come in.

40:32.980 --> 40:34.170
No one ever does.

40:35.410 --> 40:36.910
Good for you.

40:36.990 --> 40:39.450
One question: Are you
out of your damn mind?

40:39.530 --> 40:41.340
Feet on my desk,
drinking my scotch?

40:43.010 --> 40:44.260
Earned it.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.670
Did some deep cleaning.

40:46.680 --> 40:47.800
Really?

40:49.080 --> 40:50.470
I thought you said no.

40:53.690 --> 40:55.260
You were right.

40:55.340 --> 40:56.690
Todd's already
cracked the briefcase

40:56.770 --> 40:59.770
and he doesn't know how
to work the Leavenworth pods.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.400
We have Dr. Jace for that.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.410
Mmm. So...

41:08.730 --> 41:09.990
Todd got a new car.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.040
Excellent.
