WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.773
(Fox theme drumbeats)

00:07.007 --> 00:09.009
This one I call
"the writer's journey."

00:11.179 --> 00:13.281
-Stuck between two thoughts.
-Mm-hmm.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.183
Lifelike. Wow.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.617
-What the...?
-I'm sorry about that.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.287
-Cooper's my social media
director. -Open your mouth.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.955
-You're the boss.
-COOPER: Nice.

00:21.989 --> 00:25.159
-What magazine is this again?
-Teen BeTween the Lines.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.294
-Ma'am, you're in the shot.
-Ma'am, you're in the shot.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.362
-Oh, I'm... Okay.
-Still in the shot.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.198
-You're in the shot.
In the shot. -So... Oh.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.833
-Really? I guess this is on me.
-Good.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.136
-I could've gone left or right.
-NICK: Guys, let's take five.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.672
Or as Pepperwood would always
say, "Keep your knife dry."

00:38.706 --> 00:41.142
-#KeepYourKnife...
-(chuckles) Half that.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.377
-#KeepTheKnifeDry.
-Hashtag.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.479
Oof. I've got to go meet
with my editor.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.348
We're gonna talk
about the latest Pepperwood.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.983
Oh, the one you wrote in Europe?
He's gonna love it. (chuckles)

00:50.017 --> 00:51.819
Way more than the last book
he published,

00:51.852 --> 00:53.987
Dede, the Girl with A.D.D.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.023
That wouldn't even keep
my attention.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.326
-Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo. Burn.
-(laughs) Burn.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.661
You got a lot of edge
this morning, sister.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.396
Damn right I do.
I'm a working girl now.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.997
Russell and I
are building libraries.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.666
He's got me rolling up
my sleeves

01:05.699 --> 01:07.235
to make it happen.
(chuckles)

01:07.268 --> 01:09.337
Hi, this is Jessica Day
from the Schiller Fund.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.173
I'm just calling to make sure
this is still the number

01:12.206 --> 01:14.208
for a Mr. Marvin Linklever.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.709
It is?
I'll put a check by your name.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.744
When you're done with the "L"s,

01:16.777 --> 01:18.346
this is the first batch of "M"s.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.513
Sounds like a lot of busywork.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.548
You cool with that?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.183
I'm leaning toward no.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.353
-(camera shutter clicking)
-I'm listening.

01:25.386 --> 01:28.356
But at least I have time
to have lunch with my girl Cece.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.424
We're celebrating
me getting this...

01:30.458 --> 01:32.526
-glamorous new job. -WINSTON:
Oh, hell yeah. (whoops)

01:32.560 --> 01:34.262
Hey, what's up, guys?
What are you doing here?

01:34.295 --> 01:35.729
Check this out.
Look what I found.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.431
Three Men and a Little Box Set.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.200
The lady and the baby.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.901
-I got to watch this.
-JESS: Winston.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.570
-Hmm?
-How long have you been here?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.372
Not long, like, three,
four, five hours.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.240
-Something like that.
-You don't live here, man.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.942
-I'm doing a slow move. -(phone
ringing) -Oh. Mm. Duty calls.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.379
(chuckles)
It's Russell. My boss.

01:51.412 --> 01:55.048
Hey, Russell, what's up? What
you got? Oh, big meeting today.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.451
Yeah, I'll, um...
I'll get some parking cones.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.952
-Ma'am, you're in the shot.
-I am?

01:58.986 --> 02:00.388
Yeah, still in the shot.
Still. Still.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.256
In the shot, in the shot,
in the shot, in the shot,

02:02.290 --> 02:03.657
-in the shot...
-Hold on, Russell,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.058
I just have to crawl out
of my apartment.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.727
In the shot, in the shot,
in the shot,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.262
in the shot, in the shot,
in the shot, in the shot,

02:08.296 --> 02:09.597
in the shot, in the shot,
in the shot, in the...

02:09.630 --> 02:11.632
*

02:13.000 --> 02:14.435
Cece, I was up all night

02:14.468 --> 02:16.537
trying to put Ruth to sleep.
I'm losing my mind.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.207
I feel like I'm in the third act
of a Darren Aronofsky film.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.310
-Cheers, Daddy! -Yeah, tell me
about it. I'm wiped, too.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.678
I think I put on your underwear
this morning.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.547
If I'm being totally honest,
I wore your underpants once

02:26.580 --> 02:27.781
to a yoga class.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.517
Ruth, do you want
to go to sleep?

02:29.550 --> 02:33.287
-No way. -If you do, I'll write
you a check for $6,000.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.055
Checks! Checks! Yay, checks!

02:35.088 --> 02:36.824
-That didn't quite go as
planned. -Yay! -You know what,

02:36.857 --> 02:39.293
all I actually have to do
is get to this lunch with Jess.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.995
-Which is gonna be really fun.
-RUTH: Let's play patty-cake.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.298
Sorry to talk about a fun lunch
while you're at home.

02:44.332 --> 02:47.301
No, look, we have a kid now.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.969
One of us should be enjoying
our lives.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.171
(yawning): Yeah, you're right.
We should enjoy our lives.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.974
Go to your adult lunch.
Eat, drink,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.143
and come home and tell me
of the world out there.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.312
Remember me to the people.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.680
Cece,

02:59.713 --> 03:01.615
-I-I love you.
-(snoring softly)

03:01.649 --> 03:03.484
C-Cece? Hello?

03:03.517 --> 03:06.620
-Play patty-cake.
-I'm trying.

03:06.654 --> 03:10.190
Nick... (chuckles)
I don't know where to begin.

03:10.224 --> 03:14.127
I know. Pepperwood's growing up.
He's becoming... transcendent.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.464
Unbearable. What is this fluff?

03:16.497 --> 03:18.366
You've got two chapters
of Pepperwood and Jessica Night

03:18.399 --> 03:20.000
in bed eating croissants.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.370
They chase a feather
down a cobblestone street?

03:22.403 --> 03:25.339
-He fell in love, Merle.
And then he was reborn. -(sighs)

03:25.373 --> 03:27.475
And it's sweet when you think
about it like that.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.844
Okay, I've seen this a million
times. Your life has changed,

03:30.878 --> 03:32.480
and now you've lost his voice.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.181
I can't publish this.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.149
What?

03:36.183 --> 03:37.985
-What are you saying?
Pepperwood's over? -Maybe it's

03:38.018 --> 03:40.854
run its course. Maybe it's time
to move on to something new.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.224
-You have other ideas, right?
-Oh, yeah, a ton of 'em.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.826
-Okay. All right.
-So many.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.662
-Great.
-In my computer drawer at home.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.897
Well, why don't you
come in tomorrow,

03:49.930 --> 03:51.231
pitch me your best three,

03:51.265 --> 03:52.500
and we'll see what we got.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.569
No. I want to pitch you
my best ten.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.570
(both laugh)

03:56.604 --> 03:57.705
I'm gonna pitch you three.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.407
Let's make it three.
That seems...

03:59.440 --> 04:01.875
(gasps)
Hey, girl! Hey, girl!

04:01.909 --> 04:04.578
-I love that we are doing this.
-So good to see you!

04:04.612 --> 04:06.814
-Celebrating your new job.
-Two hardworking ladies.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.418
* Work hard, play hard,
work hard, play hard *

04:10.451 --> 04:12.353
-* Work hard, play h... *
-(yawns) Okay.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.754
Let's sit down. I'm beat.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.256
Ruth was up all night.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.191
Hey, excuse me, young man,
could we get two glasses

04:18.225 --> 04:19.893
-of Chardonnay?
-Chardonnay!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.195
-And a pot of coffee.
-We are doing this.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.698
We are doing it! (sighs)
So, Ruth is pretty tough,

04:24.732 --> 04:26.367
but even if she's not sleeping,

04:26.400 --> 04:29.370
at least she's not still
potty training.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.204
-Ooh...!
-(gasps)

04:31.238 --> 04:33.006
-What, baby?
-It's happening.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.909
Okay. Here we go. Here we go.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.045
-SCHMIDT: Occupied! -Why is
Daddy still in the bathroom?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.914
I don't know, honey.
This'll do. This is great.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.751
Okay, and...
(panting)

04:43.784 --> 04:47.054
(sighs)
That was a close one.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.023
Honestly, I'm just craving
some adult time.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.225
Oh. You're quick with it.
I like that.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.728
Yeah.
We're here to celebrate you.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.930
So, tell me about the job.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.600
You know, it's great. It's, um,
you know, a big office.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.235
Fueling fires.
Making a difference.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.272
-Make that money. I love that.
(chuckles) -Mm.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.278
Okay.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.582
Mmm. Honestly, I'm
probably gonna quit after lunch.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.084
-What? -Cool if we call this
your treat?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.255
Right.
Heroin's in the diaper pail,

05:22.289 --> 05:23.924
baby wipes are in the cabinet.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.059
Oh, man, she's so lucky
to have three dads.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.429
(chuckles)
Hey, have you seen this?

05:28.462 --> 05:31.599
-Come on, man. -These
three goofballs just hid heroin

05:31.632 --> 05:33.934
in the baby's diaper disposal.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.837
-What a ride! -Winston,
why are you still here?

05:36.870 --> 05:39.072
-Shh! Shh! -To have fun.
-Why are you here?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.442
(quietly):
Keep it down. Ruth is napping.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.910
In my bed?
You put that kid to sleep in...

05:42.943 --> 05:44.311
Yes, and I changed the sheets.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.681
It's very clear to me what side
of the bed you sleep on.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.983
-Busted.
-Ruth hasn't slept in 24 hours,

05:50.017 --> 05:52.285
so I drove her around in my car.
She told me she had to pee,

05:52.319 --> 05:53.320
so I brought her here.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.288
She nodded off on the toilet.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.524
It was very cute.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.759
Honestly, it reminded me of you.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.494
-That's great...
-I took 70 pictures.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.795
-But that's... -Hey, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.497
-Are you guys seeing this?
-(groans softly)

06:03.531 --> 06:05.298
(chuckles)
I just thought of it just now.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.301
Three Men and a Little Lady.
One, two, three.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.970
We should do this movie
with Ruth.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.706
Winston, you cannot do a movie.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.643
What is that goon Guttenberg
painting on the walls?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.645
Words sound weird to me
when I'm this tired.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.481
That ever happen to you?
Like, Gu-Guttenberg.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.815
Gu...

06:21.849 --> 06:23.817
-Gu...
-Gu...

06:23.851 --> 06:25.986
-Enough, guys!
-Gu'enberg.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.489
Merle hated my last draft.
He said Pepperwood is over.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.657
-What?
-I'll kill him.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.525
He wants me to pitch new ideas
by tomorrow.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.160
You can't tell ideas
to a dead man.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.497
Winston, stop!
Nobody's killing anybody.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.566
-Okay. -But the truth is,
I do have something new.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.568
And I'd like to pitch it
to you guys.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.570
-He's tough.
-Okay.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.337
-He's controversial.
-Ooh-hoo-hoo.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.039
He's pro-choice.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.841
He's Senator Porcupine.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.376
Pass. Pa-Pass in the room.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.679
-Uh, question for the author.
-No, thank you.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.847
Senator Porcupine--
how does he put on a tie?

06:53.881 --> 06:54.848
Good question.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.183
Ow!

06:56.216 --> 06:57.518
-Oh, geez.
-Aah!

06:57.551 --> 06:59.553
-(groans)
-Aah! -Mm.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.221
I don't know.
With-with his mouth?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.090
-Mm. -That's what I'm saying--
I don't have the answer.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.358
I mean, Pepperwood was all that
I had. Now I've got nothing.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.027
I feel like I'm,
like, a wood-maker

07:07.060 --> 07:09.296
who can't make any, um...

07:09.329 --> 07:11.865
-Wood. -Wood. -Wood!
See, I don't have anything!

07:11.899 --> 07:13.701
I knew it! I got nothing!

07:13.734 --> 07:15.202
(door slams)

07:15.235 --> 07:16.870
RUTH:
I'm awake!

07:16.904 --> 07:18.772
Hey, I think Ruth is awake.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.542
You think, Winston?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.243
Wait, so, you're saying

07:23.276 --> 07:24.578
that you're doing
Russell's busywork?

07:24.612 --> 07:27.047
That you, Jessica Day,
former principal

07:27.080 --> 07:30.417
of an entire school,
is doing his busywork?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.721
Nah, girl. Nah, hold up.
One sec.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.723
How's that wine and coffee
combination treating you?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.057
My heart is beating really fast,

07:37.090 --> 07:39.059
but time is moving really slow,

07:39.092 --> 07:40.894
-so it all kind of evens out.
-Hmm.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.062
Wait, why are you quitting?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.396
He has a couple guys he trusts,

07:43.430 --> 07:44.898
and I just get left out
of all the major decisions.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.266
-Typical.
-Heads up,

07:46.299 --> 07:47.267
you're putting sugar
in your wine.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.636
I made a boo-boo.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.937
Let's just...

07:51.038 --> 07:52.740
No, I made a yum-yum.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.908
-You know what
the craziest thing is? -Tell me.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.910
Every Tuesday,
he has these lunch meetings

07:56.944 --> 07:58.579
with a couple of guys
from the office,

07:58.612 --> 08:01.582
-and he's never once invited me.
-Babe.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.952
-Yes, babe. -Every woman
has a "Tuesday meeting"

08:04.985 --> 08:06.386
they haven't been invited to.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.088
How many times in your life

08:08.121 --> 08:09.923
have you been excluded

08:09.957 --> 08:11.859
from something important
or talked over

08:11.892 --> 08:14.828
or ignored because you're
the only woman in the room?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.063
It was different

08:16.096 --> 08:17.297
when I was running
my own company,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.299
but ever since we joined
with GKM,

08:19.332 --> 08:23.003
I've had to start dealing
with this male-pattern dumbness.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.105
(pumping)

08:25.138 --> 08:27.040
MAN:
Ugh.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.276
-What is that?
-It's a breast pump, Ken.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.678
I said I needed time to pump,
and you refused

08:30.711 --> 08:32.379
to change the meeting,
so here we are.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.847
Now, for the jeans campaign.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.482
Which one of these guys says,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.318
"I'm having fun in Toronto"?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.419
(pumping continues)

08:39.452 --> 08:40.821
So, for half an hour,

08:40.854 --> 08:42.623
they had to sit there

08:42.656 --> 08:46.026
and watch me get milked
like a freaking cow.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.294
Oh, yeah, your nipples
looked like pizza bagels

08:47.327 --> 08:49.296
-in that thing.
-Yeah, they do.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.198
You know what?
This is not the first time

08:51.231 --> 08:53.634
-I've been left out
of a Tuesday meeting. -Mm-hmm.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.402
Remember my first job
in administration?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.504
The budget's still too high.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.640
You know, I think it might be
the number of field trips

08:59.673 --> 09:00.974
we've been going on?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.342
What about the number
of field trips?

09:02.375 --> 09:03.476
Yes, exactly.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.579
-Great idea.
-I literally just said that.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.814
I think we're gonna need

09:06.847 --> 09:08.448
to take it out
of the transportation budget.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.183
Here's a crazy idea.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.320
What if we take it out
of the transportation budget?

09:13.353 --> 09:15.322
MEN (chanting):
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben,

09:15.355 --> 09:17.324
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben!

09:17.357 --> 09:18.859
I've been left out
of Tuesday meetings

09:18.892 --> 09:20.493
-as long as I can remember.
-Yes.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.062
Exactly. The system is broke,

09:22.095 --> 09:23.530
and I can't feel my face.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.365
-Is that a good thing?
-I don't know.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.836
Oh, that belongs in the fire.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.438
-Whoa.
-Oh, hey, guys.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.540
What do you got here, buddy?
A little room fire?

09:33.573 --> 09:34.708
That seems safe.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.209
Oh, don't worry, I got this.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.846
(sniffs)

09:38.879 --> 09:40.413
Oh, I should've known
that was whiskey. Oh.

09:42.549 --> 09:43.516
(whoops)

09:43.550 --> 09:45.352
Guys, please let me hate myself

09:45.385 --> 09:47.554
and everything
that I have created.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.022
That's it. I have to call Merle.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.858
I'm gonna tell him
that I've got nothing.

09:50.891 --> 09:51.992
-My career's over.
-(sighs)

09:52.025 --> 09:53.026
Pepperwood was all that I had.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.227
I'm done.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.329
-I'm three.
-Everybody knows that, Ruth.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.931
Okay, look, Nick,
you're not gonna call Merle.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.701
(yawning): Okay, you're gonna
go in there tomorrow,

10:00.734 --> 10:02.002
and you're gonna do...

10:02.035 --> 10:03.737
Wake up, Daddy.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.706
You're gonna do an A-plus,

10:05.739 --> 10:07.507
perfect-style job.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.242
Nick, you have
a ton of ideas, okay?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.577
A lot of i...

10:11.611 --> 10:13.213
...idea notebooks.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.882
-I don't want to hear this.
-WINSTON: Here we go.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.784
Oh, never mind,
that's a maze you drew.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.386
Yeah, you drew a maze...
then couldn't solve it.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.221
You went straight for the wall.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.255
It was a hard maze.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.957
This one is just a list of words

10:23.991 --> 10:25.258
that rhyme with "moon."

10:25.292 --> 10:26.760
But then right away,

10:26.794 --> 10:29.763
it's "bun."
"Moon, spoon, loon, bun"?

10:29.797 --> 10:31.598
The heck is this?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.233
There was no other words
that rhymed with "moon."

10:33.266 --> 10:35.235
-"Tune"? -That's what
I'm saying. I don't have a...

10:35.268 --> 10:36.569
Pepperwood was all that I had.

10:36.603 --> 10:37.905
I've got nothing.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.940
You're Mr. Diarrhea Head.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.241
Please don't say that
to me right now.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.242
I'm going through a thing
right now,

10:42.275 --> 10:43.476
so please don't say that to me.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.577
I'm asking you,
please don't call me that.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.213
Okay, Mr. Diarrhea Head.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.615
No, you're the Diarrhea Head.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.251
Okay? Schmidt, what would you
like me to do here?

10:51.284 --> 10:52.419
What do you want from me?
What am I supposed to do?

10:52.452 --> 10:54.788
Uh, you used to love
fixing my life.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.224
Before... (grunts) came around.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.325
SCHMIDT:
It's different times.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.327
I got to wipe her butt.
I got to wipe my butt.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.729
I can't wipe your butt, too.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.430
Can I get in on that?

11:03.463 --> 11:04.965
Never mind.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.433
That's it, I'm done.
I'm calling Merle,

11:06.466 --> 11:07.968
and I'm telling him
I don't have any ideas.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.103
Ruth, honey, will you please
watch Uncle Nick

11:10.137 --> 11:11.438
while Uncle Winston and I

11:11.471 --> 11:13.040
have a conversation?

11:13.073 --> 11:14.607
Fine. Follow me.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.810
I'll follow you
if I want to follow you.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.946
-Let's go.
-Okay. I'm coming.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.948
If anyone's the boss
between us, it's me.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.315
-RUTH: I'm the boss.
-(door closes)

11:22.349 --> 11:23.817
You know something,
I used to think

11:23.851 --> 11:25.318
that Nick was the Guttenberg,

11:25.352 --> 11:26.553
but it turns out

11:26.586 --> 11:28.321
he may be the little lady.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.823
Winston, I need you
to focus here.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.825
We have a spiraling man
on our hands.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.126
We just need to remind him

11:33.160 --> 11:34.762
that he has good ideas.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.830
Do we have any other
idea notebooks?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.966
Because this is just nonsense.
I read it,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.667
and I don't want to be friends
with him anymore.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.302
Maybe...

11:42.335 --> 11:44.004
it doesn't have to be
his writing.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.806
-It could be from anything.
-Hmm.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.340
-Just find something.
-You know what, yes.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.842
Yes. Um...

11:48.876 --> 11:50.878
Okay.

11:50.911 --> 11:54.447
Here we go. "All reactionaries
are paper tigers.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.817
"In appearance the reactionaries
are terrifying,

11:56.850 --> 12:00.420
but, in reality,
they are not so powerful."

12:00.453 --> 12:01.922
-That really grabs you.
-Yeah.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.457
-What is that? -It's, uh...
Mao's Little Red Book.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.827
The Chinese communist manifesto?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.295
Yes.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.864
Read that again.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.867
(whispering): "All reactionaries
are paper tigers..."

12:13.901 --> 12:15.502
You know what I don't get?

12:15.535 --> 12:18.138
When did I start thinking
it was my fault? Is that good?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.373
-Mm-hmm. -Why am I the one
who has to quit?

12:20.407 --> 12:21.842
Yes! That's right.
You know what?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.176
Tell me what day it is.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.445
It's... Tuesday.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.546
Tell me where we're going.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.015
To the Tuesday meeting.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.049
The last Tuesday meeting

12:29.082 --> 12:30.350
I won't be invited to.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.718
-Mm-hmm.
-Add this to the agenda,

12:31.751 --> 12:32.986
you jagbags.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.454
That's right.
I am drunk right now

12:34.487 --> 12:35.889
and very awake!

12:35.923 --> 12:37.991
Daddy got me this dress.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.193
Well, you know, your dad used
to, uh, dress me, too, Ruth.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.162
-Why?
-Uh, because he cared.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.297
-Why? -I don't really know,
but he did.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.267
-Why? -Before you,
I was his baby girl.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.368
WINSTON:
Nick.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.702
Look what we just found.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.704
A forgotten masterpiece.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.640
You've got to hear this.
You've still got it.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.708
"All reactionaries
are paper tigers.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.711
"In appearance the reactionaries
are terrifying,

12:58.745 --> 13:00.080
"but in reality,

13:00.113 --> 13:02.749
they are not so powerful."

13:02.782 --> 13:04.651
And that?
That's just the beginning.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.219
I mean,
I don't remember writing it.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.888
It does sound
like something I would write.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.257
Just think about it.
You're always saying stuff like,

13:10.290 --> 13:13.160
"In reality,
they are not so powerful."

13:13.193 --> 13:15.395
-In terms of the reactionaries.
-Ha ha!

13:15.428 --> 13:17.364
-I wrote that? -Check that out,
man. That's you.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.066
-That's crazy.
-Let me take a peek at that.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.233
You just need to believe
in yourself, Nick.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.102
You've still got it.
It's powerful.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.837
It's v-very...
it's-it's powerful stuff.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.405
Well, I think it's pretty clear.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.940
I'm back, boys.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.608
-Whoa! Shut up!
-(Nick laughs)

13:28.641 --> 13:29.910
I'm an awesome writer.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.544
-Yeah, you are, man.
-You're v... you're v...

13:31.578 --> 13:33.480
-you're very... you're
very good. -You're the best.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.086
If I were a red shoe,
where would I hide?

13:39.119 --> 13:41.388
-I'm going over here. Ah.
-Oh, my God. (laughs)

13:41.421 --> 13:43.423
Uh, what about back here?
No. (screams)

13:43.456 --> 13:44.724
(laughs) You got to be crazy.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.860
(quietly):
Turn that down!

13:46.894 --> 13:49.129
Ruth is finally asleep.
Also, what are you doing here?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.430
Did my wife give you a key?

13:50.463 --> 13:52.265
Yeah. For emergencies.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.466
What is the emergency?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.767
If they don't get
the little lady

13:54.801 --> 13:56.103
back from England...

13:56.136 --> 13:58.438
-man, they may never
see her again. -Oh, forget it.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.273
If you're gonna watch that,
turn on the closed captioning.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.442
If Ruth wakes up again,
I'm gonna plotz my pants.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.777
-Oh, Schmidt, are you here?
Winston! -Shh! Shh! Shh!

14:04.811 --> 14:05.845
Winston Bishop...

14:07.580 --> 14:09.116
I'll do it again.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.218
Shh!

14:11.251 --> 14:12.619
SCHMIDT (whispering):
Don't do this. Shh!

14:12.652 --> 14:14.787
Please. Why aren't you writing?

14:14.821 --> 14:17.124
I was writing, but I got
so inspired by the pages

14:17.157 --> 14:19.459
that you found that I drove
straight to Merle's office.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.328
"Revolutionary culture

14:21.361 --> 14:23.463
"is a powerful
revolutionary weapon

14:23.496 --> 14:25.632
for the broad masses
of the people."

14:25.665 --> 14:27.500
Hey, w-what do you
call this again?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.502
-Johnny's Big Day at Work.
-Nice.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.404
I have another title for you.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.941
-Mao's Little Red Book?!
-Shh! Please, voices.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.976
-Mao's Little Red Book?!
-Voices. Voices!

14:36.009 --> 14:37.677
-You lied.
-Shh.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.012
You lied to me.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.080
Don't look at it as a lie.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.982
-All right.
-Look at it as not a lie,

14:42.015 --> 14:43.683
and then...
and then you're fine.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.652
And now I'm not just a hack
with bad ideas,

14:45.685 --> 14:47.988
-but I'm a filthy commie!
-Shh. Please!

14:48.021 --> 14:49.222
And you know I'm no commie!

14:49.256 --> 14:50.423
I don't know
your personal beliefs.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.724
-You don't know
my personal beliefs? -Enough!

14:51.758 --> 14:52.825
Those are fightin' words.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.161
We didn't think
that you were gonna give

14:54.194 --> 14:55.195
those actual pages
to your editor.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.364
We were just trying
to inspire you.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.531
Also, why do you own that book?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.000
You see a red book,
you buy a red book.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.668
-What do you do with blue books?
-Don't buy.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.203
-Yellow books?
-Wait on it.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.671
-That's true.
-Hi, Daddy.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.974
No. Good God, child.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.176
Oh... my... God.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.211
I know what we need to do.

15:11.244 --> 15:15.448
* Goodnight, sweetheart,
well, my friends are liars *

15:15.482 --> 15:17.850
SCHMIDT:
* We were just trying *

15:17.884 --> 15:19.352
* To help you write... *

15:19.386 --> 15:21.021
Guys, you see what we're doing?

15:21.054 --> 15:22.855
We're doing
Three Men and a Baby.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.891
-Winston, you cannot do a movie.
-Can't do a movie.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.060
Yes, you can. You can do any
movie except for a documentary,

15:27.094 --> 15:28.528
because those already happened.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.796
Harmony on three.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.164
One, two, three.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.801
* Goodnight... *

15:34.834 --> 15:36.203
I'm not tired.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.372
-Knock-knock, Russell.
-Who's there?

15:39.406 --> 15:40.873
-Two women.
-Two women who?

15:40.907 --> 15:43.476
-Two women coming in!
-Two women coming in who?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.413
We went over this, Cece--
that's not the line.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.915
That's exactly the kind of input
we've been talking about.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.751
Russell? We need to talk.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.586
Oh, I'm scared of this energy.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.922
Ya best be.
Ya best be scared.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.024
Is she drunk?

15:57.057 --> 15:58.491
Yeah. On four glasses
of Chardonnay

15:58.525 --> 16:00.027
and two pots of coffee.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.728
And I'm drunk on rage!

16:01.761 --> 16:03.396
Knock-knock, boys.
Open your brain doors.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.565
-Sit down, Cece.
-Okay.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.900
Look, I've let this slide
too much in my life,

16:07.934 --> 16:09.436
but no more.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.839
You may not want me in this
meeting, but I belong here.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.108
-Yeah, I-I'm not sure you do.
-Too late, Russell.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.110
-I'm bustin' in.
-* Work hard *

16:17.144 --> 16:19.379
-* Play hard, work hard *
-Can't keep a good woman down.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.781
-* Play hard, work hard *
-Cece, sit. -Okay.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.516
You think
just 'cause I'm a woman,

16:23.550 --> 16:26.286
I can't bring anything
to the table? Well, try me.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.920
'Cause I'm pullin' up a chair,

16:27.954 --> 16:29.956
-and I'm gettin' in the game.
-CECE: Ooh.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.794
Okay. Guys, this is Jessica Day.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.530
Jessica, this is my
divorced father support group.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.167
We meet every Tuesday.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.271
Oh, that's why you're crying.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.473
It makes sense now.
(chuckles softly)

16:47.974 --> 16:49.276
Divorced fathers?

16:49.309 --> 16:52.812
Um, my dad...
my dad is a divorced father.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.948
Your kids
are gonna turn out fine.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.351
Sort of. There-there
might be some rough years.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.288
I like your choice of snacks.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.990
(loud crunching)

17:08.995 --> 17:10.430
JESS:
Ugh, Russell, I know

17:10.463 --> 17:12.799
you're probably mad at me
for many reasons.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.835
One you might not know about
is that my friend did indeed

17:15.868 --> 17:18.305
get sick in
the receptionist's desk drawer.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.906
-I just wanted to say...
-No, I wanted

17:19.939 --> 17:22.309
to say that this morning
I was ready to quit.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.576
Wait, you're gonna quit?

17:23.610 --> 17:25.312
But I decided not to,
because I know

17:25.345 --> 17:27.480
I can really make a difference
for these schools

17:27.514 --> 17:29.316
if you will let me.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.017
I know I was wrong
about the meeting, but you

17:31.050 --> 17:34.154
have to admit, you haven't
given me any real work to do.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.288
-That's true.
-Why is that?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.190
Do you not think of me
as an equal?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.859
Because if that's the case,
that needs to change.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.661
No, that's not it at all.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.696
Jess, it's just that
you're new here,

17:43.730 --> 17:45.532
and I've got a lot
of trust issues.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.367
Probably from
my third wife, Jackie.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.002
In fact, we were just discussing
it in the divorced dad...

17:50.036 --> 17:52.839
Wait, I thought your fourth wife
was named Jackie.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.674
I married two women
named Jackie.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.509
-Back-to-back?
-Yeah. They were related.

17:56.543 --> 18:00.079
It's complicated.
Look, I got to make this right.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.615
I hired you because I feel like
you're exactly the right person

18:02.649 --> 18:04.184
to get stuff done around here.

18:04.217 --> 18:08.755
So I guess it's time for me to
just let go and let you do that.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.423
You won't regret it.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.159
-All right.
-Also, while we're here talking,

18:12.192 --> 18:14.694
we need some tampons
in the bathroom.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.530
Are you asleep?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.366
No.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.301
Well... I give up.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.536
This is my reality.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.805
I'll never sleep again.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.007
Tell me a story, Uncle Nick.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.843
Me? No, no, no.
I don't have any stories, Ruth.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.681
* Come on, Nick,
you can do it. *

18:34.714 --> 18:35.682
Please?

18:35.715 --> 18:37.184
Nick, she asked for a story.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.786
-Why don't you tell her a story?
-I thought you wanted

18:39.819 --> 18:42.522
-to sleep, Schmidt. -I don't
know how to do that anymore.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.890
I've pushed through.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.058
-My body doesn't know
how to sleep. -All right, fine,

18:46.092 --> 18:48.295
Ruth, you want a story?
Here's a story.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.463
There was once a magical bear,

18:50.497 --> 18:51.631
and he, uh...

18:51.664 --> 18:53.300
I don't know,

18:53.333 --> 18:57.204
walked on a magical tightrope
to Seattle.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.806
Have you ever seen
a magical bear?

18:59.839 --> 19:02.642
-No. -Is there
a tightrope to Seattle?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.377
Not that I know of, Ruth.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.413
-Ugh, this is garbage.
-Well, what do you want from me?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.147
It's late at night,
you asked for a story--

19:08.181 --> 19:09.482
that's the best that came out.

19:09.516 --> 19:12.919
Weren't you ever little
like me, Uncle Nick?

19:12.952 --> 19:15.154
Of course I was little like you.
Don't you know anything?

19:15.188 --> 19:16.589
I was born
on a cold, lonely street

19:16.623 --> 19:18.157
on the South Side of Chicago.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.060
As rumor has it, and there's
no proof of this, obviously,

19:21.093 --> 19:22.662
but I delivered myself.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.932
It was my fifth birthday party,
there was a knock at the door.

19:25.965 --> 19:29.702
My father jumped up, gave us all
a thumbs-up, gave me a wink,

19:29.736 --> 19:31.738
then he jumped out the window,

19:31.771 --> 19:33.873
-bounced up, took off running.
-Oh, wow...

19:33.906 --> 19:35.275
I didn't see him for six months.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.909
My only babysitter at the time

19:36.943 --> 19:39.779
was a rollercoaster
at a local amusement park.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.216
That and a pack of cigarettes.
(chuckles wryly)

19:43.250 --> 19:45.184
Being nine in Chicago
is different.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.053
The tree fell,
hit the power line,

19:47.086 --> 19:49.389
and the power line fell
right on the hobo,

19:49.422 --> 19:51.591
shocking the hobo back to life.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.860
-That was an amazing moment.
-(whispers): Hey.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.195
I don't know, it made me
question the existence of God.

19:56.229 --> 20:00.099
I believed entirely in fate,
and it was that same fate

20:00.132 --> 20:02.469
that brought me
to the woman I love today.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.438
Uh, Nick, go back.
Uh, what happened to the hobo?

20:05.472 --> 20:07.274
He stood up, he spun around,

20:07.307 --> 20:10.209
he said, "Time to get a job,"
and he walked away.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.044
Why don't you
write it down, Nick?

20:12.078 --> 20:14.814
-About the hobo?
-WINSTON: Yeah. -Yeah, why not?

20:14.847 --> 20:16.883
Oh, this is good.
This is really good.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.453
We did it, Schmidt.
(chuckles)

20:20.487 --> 20:23.222
(snoring)

20:23.256 --> 20:25.758
Schmidt?

20:25.792 --> 20:28.628
(continues snoring)

20:28.661 --> 20:30.763
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.234
Time to go to bed, my friend.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.103
Yeah, I think the coffee's
wearing off.

20:37.136 --> 20:40.006
-I have to thank you so much
for today. -(yawning)

20:40.039 --> 20:43.810
-Uh-huh. -Even though now
I have so much work to do.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.778
Yeah, you're gonna kill it.
It's gonna be great.

20:45.812 --> 20:46.979
I love you.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.315
I do love you.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.249
-Thanks, girl.
-Hey, can I tell you a secret?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.251
-Yeah. -I'm not gonna
brush my teeth tonight.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.753
JESS:
Ooh, interesting choice.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.988
-Thank you.
-WINSTON: Come on.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.256
You don't want any of this.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.691
Unhand me!
I'm not even tired.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.959
-Go to sleep, buddy.
-Yeah, dude,

20:59.992 --> 21:01.628
you haven't blinked
in three hours. Come on.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.662
(Schmidt yawns)

21:02.695 --> 21:04.364
Cece...

21:04.397 --> 21:07.334
I love you, but...
your breath is trash.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.502
It's like a...
it's like a garbage Dumpster.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.838
-Thanks for saying that.
We were all thinking it. -Yeah.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.806
Shh, shh, shh.
Time for sleep.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.475
You get one story.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.344
Take it away, Nick.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.913
I call this one
Timothy and the Chi-Town Hobo.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.515
* Good night,
Schmidt and Cece *

21:22.549 --> 21:24.684
-* It's time for sleep *
-"What are you doing in my box?

21:24.717 --> 21:26.386
-* Do, do, do, do, do *
-"growled the hobo

21:26.419 --> 21:28.054
-* You haven't slept now *
-"to Timothy,

21:28.087 --> 21:30.323
-* For over a week *
-"as a muss of hair and a pair

21:30.357 --> 21:32.359
-* Do, do, do, do, do *
-"of young, sad, brown eyes...

21:32.392 --> 21:34.026
* We hate to leave,
but you should be *

21:34.060 --> 21:35.695
-* Counting your sheep *
-"...peeked slowly

21:35.728 --> 21:37.697
-* Oh, good night, Schmidt *
-"out of a...

21:37.730 --> 21:40.800
-* And Cece, good-night. *
-cardboard box."

21:40.833 --> 21:41.968
Good night!
